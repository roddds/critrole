00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.080
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.440
of Critical Role, where a bunch of
us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.500
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.670
TRAVIS: (hip and cool) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.395
ASHLEY: Whoa, that's a cool one.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.480
(laughter)

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.566
MATT: That was different.

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.450
TRAVIS: I just let it come.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.017
MARISHA: We're on island time, baby.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.000
MATT: The Pauly Shore guest episode.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.613
So, yes, welcome!

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:26.440
Before we get into tonight's episode,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.480
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.980
beginning with the first of three sponsors tonight.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.300
SAM: Ah!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.830
MATT: Because the scheduling stuff is crazy,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.100
and tonight we get three, which is fun.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.830
Beginning with Sam with Skillshare.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.100
SAM: Yes, this episode is sponsored by Skillshare,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.310
an online learning community

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.726
with thousands of inspiring classes
for creative and curious people.

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:48.960
Classes designed for real life,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.470
like graphic design, creative writing and music.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.678
And speaking of music,

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:56.353
with the success of Hamilton LIVE--

00:00:56.353 --> 00:00:58.429
and it's very current, guys--

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.740
(laughter)

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.410
I thought I'd write a hip hop musical about Skillshare.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.031

With annual membership starting at $10 a month,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.350
Skillshare is a great way to learn

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.900
and unlock your creativity.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.670
Go to Skillshare right now.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.975
Back to you, Matt.

00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:15.714
(cheering and clapping)

00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:17.401
MATT: Thank you, Sam, thank you.

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.130
MARISHA: Think that'll pass.
MATT: And thank you, Skillshare.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.020
Our second sponsor tonight, you've heard Sam

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.680
often mention their name and they've been here before,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.325
we have Dwarven Forge.

00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:27.158
(cheering)

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:28.560
The infamous Dwarven Forge, the creators

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.060
of the world's finest miniature game, RPG terrain.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.950
They now have their eighth Kickstarter live right now.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.478
It's called Wildlands.

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:38.070
I'm super excited about it myself.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.520
It definitely leans into more of the, like,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.780
swamps, mountainous terrain, enchanted forests,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.500
that kind of a feel, which they've touched on before,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.320
but they're really, really delving into it now,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.050
which I can't wait myself.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.350
On top of the detailed hand-sculpted

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.670
and hand-painted modular terrains that they provide,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.820
there's also some great additions,
including a mini fog machine,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.170
so they're getting in on the fog machine game,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.510
which makes me happy.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.000
Wrap-around panoramic dice and remote controlled LED lights

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.480
to show and light up your table,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.630
to bring the game into the next level, which is awesome.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.480
It ends September 2nd, so you got some time

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.280
to jump in, if you haven't yet.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.070
You can go find out more and join

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.694
the Dwarven forge adventure

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:20.627
at bit.ly/crwildlands.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.090
And for our third and final sponsor for the night,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.962
we have our friends, since the
beginning of campaign 2, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:30.002
ALL: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:31.330
MATT: If you aren't aware, you can now organize

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.840
all of your monsters, NPCs, player characters,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.610
combat rounds, and much more in real-time,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.150
in their brand new combat tracker,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.191
which has been in beta for--
it's now just launched in alpha.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.090
Also, you can organize things like

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.950
character and monster initiative in there,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.350
track HP and moves within there,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.660
rounds and turns, and lets you add new creatures

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.120
on the fly in the middle of combat,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.350
so it's a really useful tool for DMs.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.183
I'm excited to check it out myself.
I haven't yet, but it'd be a lot--

00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:59.466
in some cases more helpful than
the sheet of paper that

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:02.140
I use in front of me, which gets a little confusing.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.400
So check it out there

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.990
and more at dndbeyond.link/criticalrole.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.331

much for supporting our show.

LAURA: Woo!

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.277
MATT: All right, so, let's get
to the next couple announcements.

00:04:14.277 --> 00:04:16.643
ALL: (hooting like owls)
MATT: What?

00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:18.564
God, I hate you all.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.259
MATT: Yeah?

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.928

A ba, ba, ba!

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.879

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.201
Oh, but dere's a Vex.

00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:54.958
Oh, but dere's a Grog, and dere's a Vax.

00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.560
LIAM: Oh my gosh.
LAURA: So, yeah.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.010

TRAVIS: Holy shit,

they're real. (laughs)

00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:03.220
LAURA: Reservations are now open

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.930

Orders will ship in late September, early October.

00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:11.330
And that's the same time that the Funkos

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.396
will be available in...

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:15.405
retail stores?
SAM: What?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.790
TRAVIS: Guess that's the thing.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.200
LAURA: Yeah, so, retailers may also be running pre-orders

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.160
on them, I don't know.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.211
What?

00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:24.294
ALL: (laugh)

00:07:24.294 --> 00:07:26.720
LAURA: Also,
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.030
LAURA: Something I don't have to show you,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.100
but, it's so limited edition,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.450
that's why, we have an armored Trinket Funko

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.630

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.340

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.740
So check in with your local shops that carry Funkos

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.578
and tell them you want them.

00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:50.210
TRAVIS: They're going to be like
the ET Super Nintendo cartridge.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.751

00:07:56.634 --> 00:08:00.484
check it out at critrole.com.

00:08:03.193 --> 00:08:06.425
MATT: Thank you, Laura. (laughs)

00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:09.227
TRAVIS: It's so crazy, it's awesome!
MATT: It's so wild that they exist.

00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:11.420
LAURA: I don't even.
MATT: I can't even.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.153
SAM: It's so--
LAURA: I love them.

00:08:13.153 --> 00:08:16.069
TRAVIS: I made them all hold hands.
LAURA: I love them so.

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:17.220
MARISHA: Marisha.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.060
MARISHA: Oh, yes, last but not least--
OFF-SCREEN: (blows raspberry)

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.530
MARISHA: -- there will be-- oh!

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.850
Oh!

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.120
There will be no Critical Role next week, August 20th.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.690
We are taking that week off to regroup

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.520
and have a little summer break,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.030
and yeah, we will be back on August 27th for Episode 107.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.180
SAM: Nice.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.730
MATT: Fantastic.
TRAVIS: Summer break.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.440
LAURA: Summertime.
MATT: And with that,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.410
I believe it's time to go ahead

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.401
and jump into tonight's episode of...

00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:49.865

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.220
MATT: And welcome back.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.790
So, last we left off.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.050
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
MATT: The Mighty Nein

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.390
on the island of Rumblecusp,

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.510
in preparation for the looming date

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.760
of Traveler Con, as the various followers of the Traveler

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.900
begin to congregate towards this island.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.720
You discovered it was being beset

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.840
by some strange force and entity

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.030
that lived within the volcano.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.550
That it caused those who had lived there

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.150
and found their way stranded on the island

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.983
for an extended period of time, to lose their memory.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.560
Now you've allied with and freed the mind

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.990
of the spiritual guardian there,

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.460
a druid named Vilya.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.910
And traveled amongst the island to discover

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.800
many of the secrets that Vokodo,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.740
this entity in the mountain,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.740
this creature that apparently had escaped

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.000
from the astral plane, from the Astral Sea,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.870
fleeing from something,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.610
and holing up here had been hoping you wouldn't find.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.150
You then made plans,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.610
infiltrated the inside of this volcano into its layer

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.470
and assaulted it, with all the powers

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.080
and spells and weapons at your disposal.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.990
After some wayward spell casting

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.000
and some dangerous endeavors,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you did manage to bring Vokodo to his end.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.290
And in his final moments,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.670
a psychic wave blasted outward giving you visions

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.280
of what it was he was fleeing from.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.160
Some strange, almost living-like

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.110
city of some kind, that was coasting through

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.290
the Astral Sea in hot pursuit.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.140
As we return to tonight's game, the vision fades,

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.170
and you all sit watching as the sludge

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.890
and ash of Vokodo's disintegrating remains

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.830
begins to disperse and cloud the water around you.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.700
The glints of coin and objects of gold and brass

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.090
and other materials, tumbling slowly to the bottom

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.390
of the water-filled chamber.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.340
The liquid around you, still extremely hot

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.837
and scalding your flesh.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.670
What would you like to do, Mighty Nein?

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.920
TALIESIN: Detect Magic, first of all.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.430
MATT: Detect Magic?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.620
MATT: All right.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.950
All right, so, if you're detecting
magic, who all's doing what?

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.310
LAURA: I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.568
MATT: Beacon of Hope, you got it.

00:12:43.568 --> 00:12:48.120
MARISHA: I am about to pass out,
if anybody would love to help me.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.500
If not, I'm going to loot.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.770
I'm going to loot while I am about to pass out.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.720
LAURA: I just need everybody within 30 feet of me

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.378
if I'm going to do this, so that you guys--

00:12:57.378 --> 00:12:59.928
SAM: What is it going to do?
LAURA: It's going to give us max healing.

00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:01.950
TRAVIS: Everybody go to Jester.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.570
LAURA: Yeah, circle up so I can get us healed the most.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.400
SAM: Okay, we circle up.
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand behind Beau

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.666
and put my hand on her back.
TALIESIN: How's everyone doing, okay?

00:13:09.666 --> 00:13:11.751
LAURA: We need healing. Everybody.

00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:14.080
MATT: Well first you guys both cast spells.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.600
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.000
MATT: Everyone takes six points of fire damage.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.110
MARISHA: Yasha, it's so hot.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.020
MATT: Caduceus.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.330
MATT: You go ahead and cast Detect Magic

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.730
and you see amongst all the showering coins

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.420
plummeting to the floor,

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.540
four powerful beacons catch your eye amongst the clutter

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.530
that itself you can hear through the water.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.690
The cling, clang, cling,

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.380
things banging into each other

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.710
as it's all plummeting to the ground,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.860
no longer attached to and being held aloft by this strange,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.310
otherworldly creature that is no longer with us.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.965
TALIESIN: Are they falling places
that are close or far or--?

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.113
MATT: Since you're not too far,

00:13:54.113 --> 00:13:56.890
you could probably swim almost to it.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.170
You're a little bit too far away,

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.343
but if you want to try and swim closer, you can.

00:14:00.343 --> 00:14:03.130
TALIESIN: First I'm going to cast a healing spell, so.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.396
MATT: Okay, well, hold on.
SAM: Jester's about to heal all of us.

00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:06.770
TALIESIN: Oh, nevermind.
LAURA: Yeah, I was going to cast it

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.320
so that you can keep doing whatever you're doing.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.153
MATT: Well you cast Beacon of Hope last time.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:11.569
MATT: So we come to a new round.

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:13.090
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: I don't bollocks the order

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.600
but as soon as it's possible,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.390
I'm just going to start talking at Vilya,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.823
but I will wait until--

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.114
MATT: You've got, well, we can do it now.

00:14:19.114 --> 00:14:20.372
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

00:14:20.372 --> 00:14:23.610
I'm sorry, the thing that you
have done that with the tree,

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.745
is that possible with vegetation
of the underwater variety?

00:14:27.745 --> 00:14:30.840
MATT: "Unfortunately, no, I need a large enough trunk

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.948
"of a solid tree for it to function.

00:14:32.948 --> 00:14:36.800
"This is all strange, seaweed-type--"

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.658
LAURA: Shit.

00:14:37.658 --> 00:14:40.380
MATT: "-- disparate, underwater flowers."

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.920
LIAM: Okay. And I look around and there's no, like,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.670
overly large, gigantic--
TRAVIS: Seaweed?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.540
LIAM: Not seaweed, but--
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.550
Kelp. Anemone!
LIAM: -- massive strange sea cucumber or anything?

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.458
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.090
You have the Daylight globe in here, so you <i>can</i> see.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.680
Everyone takes another seven points of fire damage.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.730
TRAVIS: Oh!
LAURA: Okay,

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.880
and then everyone would take,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.370
if I can cast a spell?
MATT: Now you can cast a spell.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.210
LAURA: I need to-- Beacon of Hope is concentration.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.115
MATT: Correct, so go ahead and roll.

00:15:06.115 --> 00:15:07.849
LAURA: I make the save.
MATT: Okay.

00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:09.032
LIAM: I'm going to use...

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.290
Fortune's Favor because that's a shitty roll.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.590
LAURA: You're going to cast healing, too?

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.091
LIAM: Shittier roll.
MARISHA: My brain is

00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:18.900
getting poached.
LIAM: 12.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.280
MATT: So, you don't see anything.
LAURA: I can do 29 points

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.530
of healing for everyone.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.695
MATT: Everyone heals 29 hit points.

00:15:24.695 --> 00:15:25.744
LIAM: 29?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:15:25.744 --> 00:15:28.328
MATT: That's great. Caduceus?
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:31.328
TALIESIN: I'm going to, um...

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:34.950
cast a 2nd-level Cure Wounds on Beau.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.090
MATT: You got it.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.739
TALIESIN: Because you've got that up is...

00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:40.673
21 more points.

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.940
MARISHA: Yes, awesome!

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.073
MATT: Great.
TRAVIS: I have the Bag of Holding,

00:15:45.073 --> 00:15:47.960
so I'm just going to be trying
to shove shiny things--

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.800
LAURA: Did you find whatever it is that's magic?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.170
Can we swim towards and help Caduceus

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.503
pick up whatever--
MARISHA: Point 'em out.

00:15:53.503 --> 00:15:55.520
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out the four things.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.650
MATT: So Caduceus, you start pointing out amongst--

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.210
make an investigation check.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.293
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

00:16:02.343 --> 00:16:04.709
MATT: Not you, sorry, Beauregard, because
you said you were going to search.

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:06.625
SAM: Oh, I thought you were wafting away a fart.

00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:08.475
MARISHA: I'm having him point to the thing.
MATT: Okay, okay.

00:16:08.475 --> 00:16:09.613
ASHLEY: I can help.

00:16:09.613 --> 00:16:10.446
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:11.990
LAURA: I'm going to try to pick up another thing

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.369
that you're pointing at.

00:16:13.369 --> 00:16:16.540
MARISHA: The ladies split and each go to the thing.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.490
ASHLEY: Start searching.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.360
MATT: Okay, you've got it.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.620
TALIESIN: And I'm going to go towards one as well.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.900
MATT: Okay, so you guys have all gathered

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.095
in that area right there to go ahead and search,

00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:26.200
which, if you were going to cast Beacon of Hope,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.130
you would have had to-- to get everybody in there--

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.843
about there last turn.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:29.843 --> 00:16:32.560
MATT: So you'd be about that vicinity.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.393
LAURA: Okay.

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:36.440
MATT: All right, so you guys are all gathering.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.323
Go ahead and I'd say--

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:44.181
it's not much of a check you really need here,

00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:45.550
it's just the more rounds,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.300
the more goods you end up scooping in.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.747
So everyone takes four points of fire damage.

00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:54.410
MARISHA: Okay.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.780
TALIESIN: Also, I'm going to keep paying attention

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.750
whether or not it's getting hotter.
MATT: Roll again.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.230
LAURA: I'm going to.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.310
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.250
LAURA: I'm good.
MATT: You're good? All right.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.010
TALIESIN: 23.
MATT: 23.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.610
It's not getting hotter, it's just hot.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.550
TALIESIN: Okay.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.940
TALIESIN: I assume the perception check will hold

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.520
for a little while, so if it starts getting hotter?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.040
All right.
MATT: I'll let you know.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.960
LIAM: Can I find anywhere in this chamber

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.940
that would be large enough to start drawing

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.740
a teleportation circle, in here?

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.463
MATT: In this vicinity?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:28.077
SAM: How do you draw in the water?

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.385
MATT: Make another perception
check for me, if you don't mind.

00:17:34.385 --> 00:17:36.343
SAM: I'm looking for my belongings.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.710
TRAVIS: Oh, the stuff you gave?

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.890
SAM: Yeah.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.140
MATT: Okay, you go ahead and join everybody else

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.490
over in that space.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.390
It is a giant pile.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.243
Your belongings might be in there somewhere.

00:17:49.243 --> 00:17:51.177
If you're looking for something specific,

00:17:51.177 --> 00:17:52.844
make an investigation check with disadvantage.

00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:53.950
SAM: Okay.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.540
TRAVIS: Can I do the same, since I'm not doing anything,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.580
and look for any, like, weapons that are unique?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.120
SAM: Nope.
MATT: Yeah.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.125
TALIESIN: I've pointed out the

00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:02.583
only magic things in there, so.
MARISHA: Do we get to scoop up

00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:03.980
the magic things that you've found?

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.620
MATT: He's working on money.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.900
You're the one who's picking up the things

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.380
that he's pointing out.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.980
To that point, you grab--

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.760
with his aid, you grab a pair of boots.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.603
MARISHA: Okay.

00:18:15.603 --> 00:18:17.578
MATT: A coat of some kind.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.400
A small metallic case about that long,

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.870
that's closed and latched,

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.330
and a beautiful, silver staff

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.940
that has these spiral of carved runes

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.273
from end to end to each cap.
LAURA: Ooh, pretty.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.200
TRAVIS: Lawn darts.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.960
MATT: Those are the magical items.
TALIESIN: Nothing else is pinging really?

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.127
MATT: No, but there's plenty of wealth in here.

00:18:43.127 --> 00:18:44.410
LAURA: Rage looting, rage looting.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.957
Can I start looking and see if--

00:18:46.957 --> 00:18:48.310
TRAVIS: What does rage looting sound like?
LAURA: I know where

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.040
the two entrances are that we've come in and out of.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.588
Are they covered in torchblooms?

00:18:52.588 --> 00:18:53.904
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Did they close up behind us?

00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:55.080
MATT: They did, yes.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.750
LAURA: Can I look up towards the ceiling

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:57.970
and see if there's any other tunnels

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.890
that look like there's an opening out of here?

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.730
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.970
SAM: Matthew, I rolled a 21 for investigation

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.520
and I'd like to specifically look for Yasha's sword,

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.170
in addition to my stuff.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.928
ASHLEY: Flask, the Skingorger.

00:19:15.928 --> 00:19:17.410
MATT: Yep.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.600
You managed to get both of those items.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.433
SAM: Great.

00:19:20.433 --> 00:19:22.110
LAURA: 19.
MATT: 19?

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:23.933
Okay,

00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:25.570
so you start swimming around and looking above.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.730
You're not an incredibly fast swimmer,

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.900
so you're looking up in the darker space above.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.610
Nothing catches your eye as

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.580
a third option of escape yet in the chamber.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.750
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: From where you're standing, at least.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.580
LIAM: A 15 on perception.
MATT: A 15?

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.470
Looking around the area, it is a very uneven, you know,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.890
subterranean piece of terrain.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.710
The floor here is not carved,

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.160
it's not natural standing position,

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.160
it is natural, somewhat uneven,

00:19:52.468 --> 00:19:54.410
volcanic rock flooring.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.010
From what you can see in this space,

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.480
nothing seems to be suitable or flat enough

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.160
for you to do an actual circle that would complete the spell

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.270
necessary from where you are right now.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.680
LIAM: And you're describing the entire chamber

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.340
or just the vicinity of where I am?

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.730
MATT: Just the vicinity of what you can see

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.560
in this area.
LIAM: Okay.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.890
MATT: Everyone takes another six points of fire damage.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.060
LAURA: Yasha.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.968
LAURA: Can you go to the tunnel where we came from

00:20:16.968 --> 00:20:19.459
and chop away some of the torchbloom

00:20:19.459 --> 00:20:20.840
that's blocking the tunnel?

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.673
ASHLEY: Since I'm raging,

00:20:21.673 --> 00:20:23.530
I go over there and I'm just screaming.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.204
TRAVIS: What does that sound like?
ASHLEY: (roaring)

00:20:25.204 --> 00:20:27.340
MATT: You do have your--

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.960
How long does Freedom of Movement last?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.020
TALIESIN: An hour.
LAURA: An hour.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:31.853
MATT: An hour? Then yeah,

00:20:31.853 --> 00:20:35.936
you double move

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:38.377
at the speed of 40, 50?

00:20:38.377 --> 00:20:40.033
What's your speed, 40?

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.580
ASHLEY: Sorry, 50.
MATT: 50, with Mobility.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.640
ASHLEY: As I go past Beau, I put my hand on her shoulder

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.500
and heal her for 12 points.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.333
SAM: Whoa!
MARISHA: Whoa!

00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:50.940
MATT: Okay, so you'll get there next round.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.530
You go past Beauregard,

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.560
touch her with your action, then move over there.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.530
You're halfway to that entrance;

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:58.520
you'll get there next round.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.430
MARISHA: Are you okay?
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.450
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.410
TALIESIN: If anyone needs healing, I've got healing.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.500
LAURA: I think we should do a group heal.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.733
I don't know about everybody else,

00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:07.941
but I'm still over--

00:21:07.941 --> 00:21:09.460
I'm, like, 50 points down still.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.168
ASHLEY: Oh jeez, I didn't realize everybody was down.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.440
MATT: Everyone takes another three points of fire damage.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.860
LIAM: I'm going to swim in a direction

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.250
and try to find a large flat stone big enough

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.617
to make a teleportation circle on it.

00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:23.450
LAURA: Max heal.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.862
It's just max heal, whatever you do.

00:21:24.862 --> 00:21:28.240
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a
Mass Healing Word, which covers--

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.790
LIAM: Matt, what was that last damage number?
TALIESIN: -- six creatures.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.790
MATT: Three.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.300
SAM: Give me your orders.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.400
What do you want me to search for?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.110
I've got really good investigation.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.790
MARISHA: I could use more.
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.981
SAM: What do you want me to find?

00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:40.390
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.600
MARISHA: Money.
LAURA: Shiny, money.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.433
MARISHA: Jewels.
LAURA: Jewels!

00:21:42.433 --> 00:21:44.850
SAM: No, your belongings!
LAURA: I don't care about my stuff.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.190
Look for diamonds and other jewels.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.790
SAM: All right, I'll go back in and looking for jewels.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.700
MARISHA: I gave him garbage.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.533
TALIESIN: Everybody gets--

00:21:50.533 --> 00:21:52.224
MARISHA: Oh, I did give him that suude.

00:21:52.224 --> 00:21:54.500
If you find my drugs, get my drugs!

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.237
SAM: Drugs and jewels.
TALIESIN: Oh, and my amulet.

00:21:56.237 --> 00:21:57.860
MATT: Okay, drugs and jewels, investigation check.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.870
TALIESIN: Everybody, including you, gets 13 hit points.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.228
MATT: Vilya as well? All righty.

00:22:02.228 --> 00:22:03.703
TRAVIS: 13, check.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.570
MARISHA: Can I also, with any spare time that I have,

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.710
after I've grabbed this stuff,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.480
just scoop any money or jewels nearby?

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.740
MATT: Yeah, you're helping, because you've stopped looting,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.170
so you're picking up where Yasha left off.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.160
TRAVIS: I'm just doing--
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.018
TALIESIN: I'm going to go join Yasha.

00:22:17.018 --> 00:22:18.692
MATT: I'm keeping tabs of every round you guys are scooping

00:22:18.692 --> 00:22:20.506
and that will factor in.
LAURA: I'm swimming back down

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:22.550
and helping scoop, too.
MARISHA: Scoop.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.990
MATT: Okay, so you're now going to help scoop?

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.720
LAURA: Yeah, because I didn't find anything, so.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.880
MATT: You got it.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.713
All right.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:28.546
SAM: Lot of farts over there.

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:30.712
MATT: Everyone takes another six points of fire damage.

00:22:30.712 --> 00:22:31.850
TRAVIS: Fibrous.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.980
MARISHA: Six points?
MATT: Six points of fire damage.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.707
SAM: My investigation checks--

00:22:36.707 --> 00:22:37.640
LAURA: I'm good.
SAM: -- they can't be below 21,

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.700
so it's another 21.
MATT: (laughs)

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.160
Rogues. Love 'em.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.780
All right, yeah, without issue, you manage to find,

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.480
as you're running around scavenging,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.230
peering through with what light you have.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.940
You pluck a whole number of gems.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.790
You're just just scooping,

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.033
not even checking them for quality or size.

00:22:55.033 --> 00:22:57.775
Anything that looks like it's not money or--

00:22:58.661 --> 00:22:59.494
MARISHA: Drugs.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.650
MATT: You find some drugs.
SAM: It's going to be wet.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.483
MATT: What I was going to say is

00:23:02.483 --> 00:23:04.470
that there are a number of sculptures

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.630
that are in here as well,

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.950
that were probably either scavenged

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.440
or made by the villagers.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.210
There's a whole bunch of things that are worth

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.340
a lot of money here amongst the coins as well.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.970
And you guys are slowly putting them in as you go,

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.040
but mostly you're focusing on coins,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.060
which right now in this light,

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.860
it's hard to see really what the denominations are.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.690
You're just taking anything that's shiny and coin-wise,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.670
just putting it in there.
LAURA: Sparkly.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.490
TALIESIN: I'm going to start throwing some Sacred Flames

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.223
to help you out at the--

00:23:30.223 --> 00:23:32.657
LAURA: Wait, I don't know if Sacred Flame's going to--

00:23:32.657 --> 00:23:34.815
MATT: That's four points of fire damage to everybody.

00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:36.091
SAM: Mr. Clay?

00:23:36.091 --> 00:23:37.133
ASHLEY: How many?
MATT: Four points.

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:38.890
TRAVIS: Can I do an investigation check

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.262
for anything that I would recognize?
SAM: You need me to find something for you?

00:23:40.262 --> 00:23:42.500
TALIESIN: Have you seen my red amulet and my shield?

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.430
That'd be great.
MATT: Sure.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:44.263
LAURA: I'm good.
SAM: Shield?

00:23:44.263 --> 00:23:45.732
That sounds very important.

00:23:45.732 --> 00:23:48.227
LIAM: Still looking for a flat area.

00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:50.020
MATT: So you're shifting to this side, here?

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.853
LIAM: Anywhere where none of us are at.
TALIESIN: Oh, and my teapot. I don't know.

00:23:52.853 --> 00:23:54.260
MATT: Okay, on this side?
SAM: One.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.540
Make another perception check.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.330
TRAVIS: 21 on investigation for stuff

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.640
I would recognize.
TALIESIN: I'll take the teapot.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.760
MATT: For perception, you mean?

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.350
TRAVIS: I did an investigation.
SAM: Over your shield?

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.900
Your defining characteristic?
MATT: Okay, to look for anything you recognize?

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.310
TRAVIS: Anything I recognize.
TALIESIN: It's more of a sentimental.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.268
TRAVIS: That I personally or somebody else had.

00:24:08.268 --> 00:24:09.513
MATT: Right, okay.
SAM: It's on all of your designs!

00:24:09.513 --> 00:24:10.810
TALIESIN: I've got another shield.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:11.951
MATT: Keeping an eye out for it

00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:14.092
and nothing catches your eye.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.370
LIAM: 14.
MATT: 14?

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.510
LIAM: Yeah.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.280
MATT: Unfortunately in this room, it's not designed

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.340
for extremely meticulous and, you know,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.020
the careful necessity of magic,

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.200
such as a teleportation circle,

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.350
which requires a very flat surface to do.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.020
MARISHA and LAURA: So we're going to have to swim.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:30.970
LAURA: Through the tunnels?

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.338
Caleb, you remember how to get through the tunnels back out?

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:35.736
LIAM: Yeah, I could lead us out easily.

00:24:35.736 --> 00:24:37.569
MATT: Everyone takes eight points of fire damage.

00:24:37.569 --> 00:24:38.710
LAURA: Ugh.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.180
SAM: I'm going back in for more stuff.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.432
This time I'm looking for his amulet and my gun.

00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:45.590
MATT: Make another investigation check.
MARISHA: Can I switch

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.583
and start grabbing any of those valuable-looking weapons,

00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:50.960
that I can scoop up firewood-style?

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.860
MATT: Sure, yeah, make an investigation check for you.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.780
SAM: 21.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.237
MATT: 21.
SAM: Don't you know it.

00:24:55.237 --> 00:24:56.787
(laughter)
MATT: That's wild.

00:24:57.707 --> 00:24:59.230
It's just fun to make you roll this point.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:03.360
You've managed to find your gun amongst the crazed cluster

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.150
of what now is piled amongst the silt and residue

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.190
of the creature you just destroyed,

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.530
as well as the amulet that was lost.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.671
SAM: Is this it?
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good. That's good.

00:25:14.671 --> 00:25:16.580
MATT: 18, all right.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.000
You pick up a number of, looks like,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.737
marble and ivory sculptures.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.240
TRAVIS: Are there remains in this pile?

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.080
Like a skeleton?
SAM: Caleb, what did you give up?

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.680
MATT: You do not see any remains there.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.238
TRAVIS: Making sure nobody was like--
LIAM: A trinket.

00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:33.504
TRAVIS: "My child is the most precious thing to me."
LIAM: A necklace.

00:25:33.504 --> 00:25:34.545
LAURA: I'll help Caleb.

00:25:34.545 --> 00:25:36.439
I'll look for Caleb's necklace.

00:25:36.439 --> 00:25:39.140
LIAM: No. (stammering) Let's focus on--
LAURA: I'm going to help look for Caleb's necklace.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.251
LAURA: You're both looking? Well, yeah, you're--
LIAM: I'm not.

00:25:41.251 --> 00:25:44.148
LAURA: I'm going to look for Caleb's necklace.
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

00:25:44.148 --> 00:25:45.456
LIAM: It's-- it's-- (sighs)

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.580
LAURA: Hmm, I didn't roll very good.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.680
10.
MATT: 10?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.150
Ah, you're having a hard time finding it, pinpointing it.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.180
Everyone takes another seven points of fire damage.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.675
LAURA: We should probably get out of here.

00:25:55.675 --> 00:25:57.870
SAM: No, there's still more shiny things to get.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.280
TALIESIN: Gotta go.
MARISHA: Did we get anything else

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.730
or just the marble and the ivory?

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.980
LAURA: Who knows what the village is doing right now?

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.680
We're fine. I'm fine on concentration.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.880
LAURA: I can do another Mass Cure Wounds.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.888
LIAM: Yeah, that would be welcome.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.162
MATT: Vilya says, "So-- so can I."

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.720
TALIESIN: Oh!
MATT: "Together?"

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.360
LAURA: I mean, if we both did it, mine's a 6th-level spell.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.990
That's all I have for--
MATT: "Mine would be fifth."

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.560
LAURA: Maybe you should do--

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.260
MATT: "All right."
LAURA: No, but, how--?

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.660
Do you have teleport?

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.830
MATT: "I have nothing to travel through here."

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.090
LAURA: Yeah, but if we get through the tunnels,

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.420
maybe you can teleport us back to the village or something.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.740
I don't know, maybe you should keep your high level.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.770
MATT: "That'd be my sixth."

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.815
LAURA: Oh, okay, then do the Cure Wounds.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.520
MATT: So-- oh no, it's max because of the thing--

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.430
so that would be 3d8 plus
LAURA: 29.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.310
MATT: So--
LAURA: Oh!

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.580
MATT: 16, 28.
LAURA: 28.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.290
TALIESIN: 28?
MATT: 28 heal to everyone.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.560
MARISHA: Yes, okay.
TALIESIN: We should move.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.610
LAURA: We should move.
TALIESIN: It's time.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.510
MATT: Everyone takes another eight points of fire damage.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.110
SAM: This is fine.
LAURA: No, because we're going to

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.380
have to go through the tunnels.
It's still hot in there.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.260
TALIESIN: We're going to run out of heals.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.068
ASHLEY: Since I'm going walking toward the--

00:27:10.068 --> 00:27:11.809
swimming towards the torchblooms--
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:14.578
You're at the torchblooms now
and they've closed in and now

00:27:14.578 --> 00:27:18.395
there's just like-- you can barely
see through where you would previously swim.

00:27:18.395 --> 00:27:20.447
LAURA: Is the whole tunnel closed off or is it just--?

00:27:20.447 --> 00:27:21.363
MATT: No, the tunnel's open.

00:27:21.363 --> 00:27:23.257
It's just the torchblooms.
LAURA: Okay.

00:27:23.257 --> 00:27:25.930
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going at it, I would assume.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:30.580
MARISHA: Yeah, she's been hacking away.
MATT: All right, so you're just tearing into it.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.030
As you're carving through, you carve two feet into it

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.110
in the period of a round

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.318
and it's...

00:27:38.527 --> 00:27:42.652
I mean, all of it's reaching outwards slightly.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.755
Make an athletics check for me.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.790
SAM: Is there music on right now, Matt?

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.890
MATT: There is. There should be.
ASHLEY: Doesn't sound like it.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.420
LAURA: I can't hear it.
SAM: God damn.

00:27:53.267 --> 00:27:54.759
MARISHA: I don't hear it either.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.220
ASHLEY: 11.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.500
MATT: 11.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.080
You're carving though.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.940
You get partway into it.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.395
It seems to keep going.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.240
You're not sure if there's going to be an end to it,

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.073
if you're on the cusp,

00:28:09.073 --> 00:28:12.120
or if it's just going to be this way the entire tunnel,

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.250
but that's as far as you get this round.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.120
LAURA: Can I come help Yasha?

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.680
MATT: If you'd like to.
LAURA: Yeah, I think I'm done.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.310
TALIESIN: We got to start getting ready to go.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.850
MARISHA: I'm going to scoop for one more turn.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.333
SAM: I'm going in for one more.
MARISHA: I am, too.

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.374
MATT: To move in a dash--

00:28:24.374 --> 00:28:26.824
All right, to move in a dash,
you won't be able to get to Yasha

00:28:26.824 --> 00:28:28.782
until next round, because you're
having to swim through it--

00:28:28.782 --> 00:28:31.082
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: -- but you can help her out.

00:28:31.082 --> 00:28:33.170
LIAM: I'll throw out a Detect Magic right where I am

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.780
to see if there's anything in my vicinity before we go.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.360
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and--

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.470
Everything magical is currently equipped

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.320
or held by your party.
LIAM: Understood.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.380
MATT: Everyone takes eight points of fire damage.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.603
TRAVIS: I think we're all--

00:28:47.603 --> 00:28:49.886
I think that was the ninth roll?
MARISHA: Dang.

00:28:49.886 --> 00:28:51.850
TRAVIS: Plus or minus one?

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.490
MATT: That was the 10th roll.
TRAVIS: 10th roll.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.020
LAURA: How many rolls-- how many
turns before a minute is up?

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.130
MATT: 10.
LAURA: Okay.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.310
So my Beacon of Hope probably died.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.880
MATT: Okay, so your Beacon of Hope now fades.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.410
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.835
SAM: I'm going back in for one more pass.

00:29:04.835 --> 00:29:08.076
MARISHA: Yeah, Veth and I, one more pass,
and then we'll all bolt towards the tunnels.

00:29:08.076 --> 00:29:09.990
TALIESIN: If the heals are
down we got to move right now.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.790
SAM: I'm looking for the Dagger of Denial,

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.940
possibly his amulet, and any buttons that I can see.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.510
MARISHA: I'll assist Nott.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.140
MATT: All right, so make an
investigation check with advantage.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.190
SAM: What do I do?
MATT: Off the table.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.110
SAM: It fell off the table.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.020
MARISHA: Just roll another dice.
MATT: Just roll again.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.627
SAM: It's gone forever.
LIAM: Show's over, everybody.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.750
SAM: 21.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.710
LAURA: What?
SAM: What are the odds?

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.840
MARISHA: With advantage?
LAURA: With advantage?

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.190
SAM: Oh, with advantage.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.610
MARISHA: I'm giving you--
SAM: 21.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.202
MARISHA: You could roll higher than that.
TRAVIS: What if you roll a natural 20?

00:29:38.202 --> 00:29:39.151
SAM: Okay.

00:29:40.034 --> 00:29:42.317
21!
(laughter)

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.417
MATT: All right.

00:29:45.417 --> 00:29:48.017
You will be able to find his amulet.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.415
What else are you looking for? You're looking for--?

00:29:50.415 --> 00:29:53.156
SAM: I was looking for the dagger,
buttons, or the amulet.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.010
MATT: I'll say the buttons.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.410
SAM: And his amulet or just the buttons?

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.380
MATT: Buttons and the amulet.
SAM: Great.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.020
MATT: You don't find the dagger.
LAURA: Great.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.470
SAM: Awesome.
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.970
ASHLEY: Your dagger?
SAM: It's okay.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.455
MATT: Yasha, make another athletics check.

00:30:06.455 --> 00:30:08.442
You still need to cut through.
ASHLEY: Okay, come on.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.380
Much better!

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.730
That would be a 27.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.070
MATT: 27.
MARISHA: Yes, yes!

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.903
MATT: You carve through.

00:30:14.903 --> 00:30:18.520
You start getting into the pattern, the movement,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.920
eventually you carve through.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.120
You get about five or six feet into this tunnel

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.930
before you cut through one heavy swath

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.100
and you can see as it falls away,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:28.940
the rest of the tunnel

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.740
is in its natural recoiled state.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.900
Seems like just this patch at the entryway itself

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.366
has been puckered, if you will.

00:30:37.366 --> 00:30:38.540
(laughter)

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.750
TRAVIS: Great choice.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.770
MATT: Anybody else?
LIAM: Where's the butthole?

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.940
TALIESIN: Just start moving out.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.290
LAURA: Everybody get out of here!
TRAVIS: We're swimming.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.730
TALIESIN: Gotta go now.
LAURA: Get to the tunnel,

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.590
get to the tunnel!

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.660
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to cast Expeditious Retreat

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.170
and zoom a bit ahead and start to lead the way out of here,

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.630
using Keen Mind to trace steps through tunnel.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.050
MATT: Yasha, are you waiting for them to come up to you

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.170
or are you just going on ahead?

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.580
ASHLEY: I want to make sure they get through.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.500
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Because Caleb is the one

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.590
that will be able to get us out of here.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.160
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to let him go through first.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.310
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.270
So all of you guys at different speeds of swimming,

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.050
begin just quickly make your way

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.750
towards the exit of this chamber.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.846
LAURA: As we get up close to it,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.270
as everybody groups up towards the tunnel,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.320
I'm going to use my pearl of power

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.620
and cast Beacon of Hope one last time.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.830
And then as soon as I can again,

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.510
I'm going to use my 6th level spell to heal.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.660
Maybe in a couple of rounds,

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.068
once people are down (laughs) a little bit.

00:31:33.068 --> 00:31:35.430
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.000
All right, so, you guys now, one by one, boof, boof, boof,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.330
make your way into the exit tunnel from where you came.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.930
The heavy rumbling of the angry volcano,

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.500
seems to have subsided, with the passing of Vokodo.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.350
LAURA: That's good.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.870
MATT: The water itself is extremely hot.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.020
In about a half minute of panicked swimming,

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.870
you begin to realize that the temperature

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.931
seems to be slowly dropping.

00:32:00.931 --> 00:32:02.730
LAURA: (sigh) Good.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.330
SAM: We could go back, we could go back for more.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.268
LAURA: It's dropping because we're out of the chamber.

00:32:08.268 --> 00:32:09.560
But we can probably go back in,

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.160
once it's a little cooler in there, yeah?

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.995
SAM: Yeah!
TALIESIN: Like tomorrow,

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.993
if the volcano doesn't collapse.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.050
TALIESIN: Do they do that?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.330
LAURA: So I don't need to
use my healing, then, if we're all--

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.410
if the temperatures dropped and we're not dying?

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.674
ASHLEY: I mean, I could try to go get one more--
MATT: You cast the spell, but--

00:32:30.674 --> 00:32:31.690
LAURA: I cast Beacon of Hope.
MATT: -- the damage

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.370
is not continuous.
TALIESIN: Is anybody--

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.330
who's still low? Who needs a little bit of a pick-me-up?

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.130
SAM: We're fine.
LAURA: I mean, I'm still--

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.920
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe hold it for now.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.690
LIAM: I'm always a little...
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.630
LAURA: I'm still 40 points under where--

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.950
TALIESIN: Well, then, let me--
SAM: Underwear?

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.680
LIAM: Exercise is for chumps.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.030
Sure.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.630
LIAM: The only muscle I need is this one.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.030
MATT: So, what is the marching order of you guys

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.530
traveling back through these tunnels?

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.530
LAURA: Caleb?
LIAM: Yeah?

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.395
LAURA: Caduceus.
SAM: Who's slowest?

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.220
MATT: Caleb.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.760
Caduceus.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.630
And who else, what?

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.940
LAURA: I should come up towards the back,

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.060
in case any extra healing needs to happen.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.534
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll sit back with
Jester since I'm a fast swimmer.

00:33:14.534 --> 00:33:16.810
SAM: Yeah, I'll come with you.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.532
MATT: So, Caleb, Caduceus, Fjord?

00:33:19.532 --> 00:33:22.800
TRAVIS: I'll be in the back with Jester.
MATT: Oh, Fjord's in the back with Jester, okay.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.810
TRAVIS: I'm unrestricted.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.050
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you a Healing Word really quick.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.970
MATT: Yasha and Beau are in the middle?

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.040
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay in the back.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.110
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Thank you.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.350
SAM: I'll stay in the back with Yasha.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.060
ASHLEY: I want to do one last investigation.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.930
SAM: Yeah, rock and roll!
MATT: Okay, so you guys

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.100
are staying back.
ASHLEY: Before I leave the room.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.570
TRAVIS: You're that friend in Vegas that's like,

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.220
"We could hit this table!

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.880
"We're going to hit this table on the way out!"

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.870
MATT: Both of you guys make an investigation check.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.320
TRAVIS: "It's only a $15.00 bucket."

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.220
SAM: Advantage or disadvantage?

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.927
MATT: Standard.
SAM: Standard.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.500
Ooh!

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.430
ASHLEY: 18.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.490
SAM: Natural 20.
(cheering)

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.370
TRAVIS: There it is.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:02.990
MATT: Without issue, you manage to find

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.400
the final object you seek, which is the Dagger of Denial.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.420
ASHLEY: Yes!
SAM: And what about you?

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.880
Did you get anything?

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.170
ASHLEY: I didn't-- I don't-- yeah,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.560
did I find anything?

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.470
TRAVIS: We'll find out later.

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:15.600
MATT: You gather a few more pockets full of gold

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.370
and worthy materials,

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:19.950
but the things that were specifically of interest

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:20.940
have already been grabbed from

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.473
the pile there.
LAURA: Oh, what about that big green jewel?

00:34:23.473 --> 00:34:24.830
SAM: We were looking for jewels.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.390
LAURA: Yeah, we were, but specifically
that green one, remember?

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:28.890
TALIESIN: That two cherry [inaudible].
ASHLEY: What was the one that was on--

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:30.490
SAM: Okay, I'll go back in. (laughs)

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.050
ASHLEY: Wait, did you guys get
the one that was stuck on him?

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.066
TRAVIS: I think that's the same one, right?

00:34:34.066 --> 00:34:34.899
The green one?
ASHLEY: It's the same one?

00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:37.340
LAURA: The big green one. The one
that Vilya had been talking about.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.870
MATT: Yeah, it's about that large.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.703
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Did we get it?

00:34:39.703 --> 00:34:42.210
Is that part of the-- did we get it?

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.440
MATT: You guys were grabbing a lot of stuff.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.140
You can go ahead and check and make a perception check

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.120
to see if it's around, if you may have grabbed it or not.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.530
MARISHA: Do it, do it, do it.
SAM: A perception check?

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:49.540
MATT: Correct.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.800
SAM: Yasha, why don't you make a perception check?

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.277
TRAVIS: I'll reach into the Bag of Holding--
ASHLEY: We'll both look.

00:34:54.277 --> 00:34:55.393
TRAVIS: -- trying to pull out the green jewel.
SAM: We'll both look.

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:57.300
MATT: Well, you're up in the chamber with everybody else.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.300
SAM: Not as good.
TALIESIN: They're being ridiculous.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.640
SAM: Four. (laughs)

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.164
MATT: Nope.
(laughter)

00:35:03.164 --> 00:35:04.420
ASHLEY: 21?
SAM: Ooh!

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.550
MATT: 21.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.600
Looking about the space here, as you guys

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.270
are coasting through. The temperature's slowly--

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.580
it's never going to probably cool,

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.060
but it's not scalding at the moment.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.360
LAURA: Oh, good.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.728
MATT: Looking around the space in here,

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.840
you don't see a green jewel.

00:35:26.817 --> 00:35:28.270
ASHLEY: Okay, maybe you guys got it.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.560
SAM: We got a lot of jewels.
ASHLEY: Got a lot of good stuff.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.393
SAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:35:31.393 --> 00:35:32.226
SAM: Probably got it.

00:35:32.226 --> 00:35:34.780
ASHLEY: I was just trying to do <i>something</i>.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:35.920
SAM: You did great!

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.930
ASHLEY: I was definitely the MVP of the fight.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.790
SAM: You hacked away at the stuff.

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:41.080
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, let's go.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.900
SAM: And it's warm in here now, it's pleasant.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.200
We could stay for a while.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:47.170
ASHLEY: I know, it's like the hot tub

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.120
at home.
SAM: Yeah!

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.973
Except it's all over you.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:35:49.973 --> 00:35:51.390
TALIESIN: No.
(laughter)

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.600
LIAM: I pull out a wire and say: How are we doing?

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.220
Are you dead in there?

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.274
You may reply to this message.

00:35:57.274 --> 00:35:59.870
SAM and ASHLEY: (scream)
LAURA: (laughs)

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.780
TRAVIS: Oh god, they're cooking alive.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.775
LIAM: (like C-3PO) Oh dear, R2.
(laughter)

00:36:06.777 --> 00:36:08.577
MATT: All right, Caleb, you are leading.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.052
I need you to...

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.463
for this

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.420
make a survival check.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.983
LIAM: Oh, so high.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.860
MATT: This is you trying to look at the details

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.720
in the environment to try and find clues

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.990
that can lead you back out,

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.920
as well as relying on your memory.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.030
LIAM: Keen Mind doesn't--?
MATT: Keen Mind does

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.000
some good things, Liam.
(laughter)

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.030
LIAM: Everything in the last month, Matt!

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.750
MATT: Everything you've seen or read.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.100
That doesn't mean-- you've seen tunnels

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.280
and you came through the other direction,

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.460
so it's still challenging to reverse-engineer

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.720
a rapid pace in the way in.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.740
LAURA: That's true, that's true.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.480
ASHLEY: Natural 20.
LIAM: No, it's a nine-- it's a 11.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480
MATT: It's an 11, okay.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.360
I will give you advantage because of your Keen Mind feet.

00:36:55.716 --> 00:36:57.006
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on!

00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:59.110
MATT: The new Lucky of this campaign.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:00.880
LIAM: Ooh, I just pick things out of the book, man.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.212
MATT: No, it's--
(laughter)

00:37:04.212 --> 00:37:05.877
SAM: Are you are you Hasted here?

00:37:05.877 --> 00:37:08.148
Did you put your Boots of Haste on?
LIAM: It's a 16.

00:37:08.148 --> 00:37:09.454
MATT: A 16?
LIAM: I have Expeditious

00:37:09.454 --> 00:37:10.510
Retreat going.
MATT: Yeah.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:11.400
Okay, good, good.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.300
So with the 16,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.270
you guys begin the first leg of this journey,

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.200
rushing through tunnels.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.510
It is a labyrinth

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.273
from this side.

00:37:20.273 --> 00:37:22.930
Previously, you had the magic that was drawing you in

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.190
and you were following the individuals

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.670
that were being compelled to make their way

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.640
towards the heart of the subterranean tunnel system.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.690
But without that enchantment, it's relying on memory

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.180
and trying to follow some sort of subtle flow to the water.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.590
Caleb leading the way for the first leg of this journey.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.640
The first five or so minutes into it,

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.590
you seem to be finding a groove

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.000
and you're finding your way through.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.380
You're getting to this point, to this point, to this point.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.740
Make another survival check with advantage, please.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.770
LIAM: Seaweed right?

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.060
LAURA: Can I--
LIAM: Seaweed left.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.893
Seaweed left again?

00:37:50.893 --> 00:37:52.600
LAURA: I'm going to Bless him.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.750
I mean--

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.733
MATT: You can't get up to him.

00:37:54.733 --> 00:37:55.566
LAURA: I can't Guidance?

00:37:55.566 --> 00:37:56.720
MATT: Well, you can't get close enough to him.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.740
LAURA: Oh right, I'm too far back.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.880
LIAM: Natural 20.
LAURA: You can Guide--

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.950
TRAVIS: Natural 20?
LAURA: Whoa!

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:00.820
MATT: Natural 20.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.460
Okay.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.600
You reach one medium chamber,

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.410
which you recall passing before,

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.310
which has seven different possible tunnels,

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.860
some small, some big

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.300
and you, glancing around--

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.030
you take a moment, you can feel a faint flow of water

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.160
and you're like, this direction.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.670
And as you point in, everyone else follows

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.980
and the tunnel system continues.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.530
You go on, now this is the second part of the leg,

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.840
another five or so minutes go by.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.440
If you recall, it took about a half an hour or so,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.330
for you to reach the center chamber.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.640
Make another check with advantage, please.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.430
LIAM: I'm Will Graham-ing it.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:33.480
That is a--

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.510
ASHLEY: This is my design.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.140
LIAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 21.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.080
MATT: 21, nice.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.620
All right, pushing forward into about a 15-minute period

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.480
of this return journey.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.460
The water itself getting slowly cooler

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.170
the further away that you traverse from the center

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.546
of where you fought Vokodo.
LAURA: Woo, it's a little bit chilly.

00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:54.501
MATT: And in doing so, you are also
giving a very, very good watch

00:38:54.501 --> 00:38:56.210
upon the interior of these tunnels

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.480
and getting everyone what you believe to be so far

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.040
the proper exit point.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.923
Go ahead and make another survival check

00:39:01.923 --> 00:39:03.073
with advantage.
SAM: Come on, Caleb.

00:39:03.073 --> 00:39:04.348
LAURA: You can do it!

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.290
LIAM: Not so good.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.030
10.
MATT: 10, okay.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.020
SAM: You want us to turn around and go back?

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.030
MATT: So, Caleb at the front,

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.640
pushing through trying to make sure to not--

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.450
and this is, like, with enough speed,

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.500
but still taking care as to not

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.990
brush against or run headlong into any of the torchbloom

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:26.090
that largely covers the interior of most of these tunnels.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:27.870
You arc left and go down one tunnel

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.380
and it comes to an end.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.320
And you can see something coiled up at the end of the tunnel

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.753
that suddenly (hisses).
TRAVIS: Ah!

00:39:36.753 --> 00:39:40.340
MATT: You see this red scaled serpent

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.980
that is coiled up and seems to be using this tunnel end

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.100
as its home, pulls back and (hisses) lashes out at you.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.292
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Oh, fuck

00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:53.190
TRAVIS: How far back-- where'd we go wrong?

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:56.360
MATT: That is a 22 to hit.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.270
MARISHA: Whoa!
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.560
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that hits.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.153
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Things just got complicated.

00:40:02.153 --> 00:40:04.420
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.612
MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.040
and six points of fire damage.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:15.350
And now there's a serpent right in your face,

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:16.183
up against you.

00:40:16.183 --> 00:40:18.643
What are you going to do?
LIAM: I turn into a shark.

00:40:18.643 --> 00:40:19.850
(laughter)

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.360
MATT: You turn into a shark with Polymorph?

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.540
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: Okay!

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.640
TRAVIS: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: You (explosion)

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.650
turn into a great white shark in the space.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.380
This tunnel, which--
LIAM: A hunter shark,

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.620
not a great white.
MATT: Okay.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.580
LIAM: One size down.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.160
MATT: Okay. What's the size on it?

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.968
LIAM: Zubba, zubba, zubba.

00:40:34.968 --> 00:40:36.327
Where does it say that on here?

00:40:36.327 --> 00:40:37.160
Large.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.560
MATT: It is large, okay.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.460
So as you (explosion) into a hunter shark,

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.720
you partially wedge yourself into this tunnel.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.170
The tunnel system which is wide enough

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.240
for a medium-sized creature

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.680
to move through carefully between the torchbloom,

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.240
you swell into, and part of the rock

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.540
gets you caught in there.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.380
You can try and break free with a strength check

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.213
on your next turn,

00:40:55.213 --> 00:40:57.430
but you're taking torchbloom damage every turn,

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.970
because you're just big enough

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.740
to burn through the tunnels as you go.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.090
LIAM: Okay.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.740
MATT: So you use your action to turn into this.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.720
If you try and flee, take a strength check

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.553
using the creature strength

00:41:07.553 --> 00:41:09.960
to see if you can pull away from the rigid edges.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.380
LIAM: Is it within reach to attack, as well?

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.290
MATT: Yes, you can attack or try and break free.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.330
Oh no, you used your action to cast,

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.780
so you can't attack this round, but it is within range.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.450
Next turn you can try and attack it.

00:41:21.213 --> 00:41:23.360
LIAM: I'll try to break free for the moment.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.610
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a strength check.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.220
SAM: Sharks are notoriously great at swimming backward.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.490
LIAM: 19.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:29.323
MATT: 19. (laughs)

00:41:29.323 --> 00:41:31.010
LIAM: I just do this.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.910
MATT: Yeah, actually, sharks can't swim backwards, can they?

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:34.770
TALIESIN: Can break the rock, though.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:35.603
SAM: I mean.

00:41:35.603 --> 00:41:37.350
MATT: I'm going to look that up.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.783
TRAVIS: No, they can't.
SAM: No.

00:41:38.783 --> 00:41:40.710
LAURA: (laughs)

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:42.170
TALIESIN: They just have to hold their breath.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.463
SAM: Maybe he can just burrow forcefully.
TRAVIS: Close the gill? Yeah.

00:41:48.463 --> 00:41:50.420
They're literally engineered to not do that. (laughs)

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.500
MATT: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.260
MATT: That's true, you can't swim backward.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.270
You are stuck in the tunnel.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.480
LIAM: I feel like I would have known the animal size

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.161
I was turning into, in relation to the tunnel I was in,

00:42:02.161 --> 00:42:03.411
but I'm stuck in this tunnel.

00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.760
I'm going to wait to bite it.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.197
I'll wait to bite it.
MATT: Okay.

00:42:07.197 --> 00:42:08.030
SAM: Great.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.730
TRAVIS: Do we just see Caleb go (foomph) in front of us?

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.625
MARISHA: We're like, "Uh?"

00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:15.477
LAURA: Caleb!
MARISHA: Caleb, go!

00:42:15.477 --> 00:42:16.827
SAM: We can't get through the tunnel!

00:42:16.827 --> 00:42:17.911
MARISHA: Caleb, move!

00:42:17.911 --> 00:42:19.990
MATT: I mean, you guys can try and pull him back.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.440
LIAM: Yeah, pull my tail.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.610
SAM: Yasha?

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.180
LAURA: Wait, but she can't get up to him.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.150
TRAVIS: Why not?
LAURA: It would have to be

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.491
Caduceus that pulls him back, right?

00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:30.010
TALIESIN: I'll give him a pull.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.850
MATT: You can try and squeeze by,
but that will require a check

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:33.525
to make sure you don't burn yourself in the torchbloom.

00:42:33.525 --> 00:42:36.160
TALIESIN: I can do this. It's just a shark.
TRAVIS: Does someone want to assist you for that?

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.700
MATT: Make a strength check.
SAM: "It's just as shark."

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.020
TRAVIS: Assist you, assist, anyone?
TALIESIN: No, it's okay, I got it.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.500
That's a check?

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.408
MATT: Yes.

00:42:44.408 --> 00:42:45.243
TALIESIN: Two.

00:42:45.243 --> 00:42:47.746
(laughter)

00:42:47.746 --> 00:42:50.030
MATT: You grab onto the shark's tail

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:54.280
and realize you don't have anything to leverage yourself on,

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.030
you're just trying to swim backward

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.250
and remain stationary.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.580
TALIESIN: He's really in there.
TRAVIS: That's the best.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.996
Tug-of-war in water.

00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.221
LIAM: I just tubbed

00:43:03.221 --> 00:43:05.080
in there too tight.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.940
TALIESIN: Quit flailing.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.940
MATT: As the tunnel pincers a bit and you realize,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.610
and reflexively make the transformation is that

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:14.785
"Ah, shit."

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.432
But first you take,

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.970
one point of fire damage from the torchbloom.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.350
LIAM: Okay.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.610
MATT: And now, the serpent's going to go ahead

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:26.090
and strike at your shark form.
LIAM: Okay.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.400
MATT: That is going to be 19 to hit.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.770
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, hits.
MATT: All right.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:35.140
Shark form takes 12 points of piercing damage

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.830
and five points of fire.
LIAM: Jeez, okay.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.120
MATT: It's your turn.
LIAM: Okay.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.460
I bite it.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.855
MATT: Roll an attack.
LIAM: Yes.

00:43:41.855 --> 00:43:45.680
(laughter)

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.113
LIAM: 22.

00:43:48.113 --> 00:43:50.687
MATT: 22 definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.063
TRAVIS: The shark!

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:56.097
(laughter)

00:43:56.097 --> 00:43:58.260
LIAM: That is 14 points of piercing damage.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.150
MATT: 14 points piercing damage.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.370
As you bite into the side of it,

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.900
the water clouds with the dark blood of this creature,

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.450
as it struggles in your grasp

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:08.250
before it slips away from your teeth and it is wounded,

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.520
but it's still alive.
LIAM: Okay.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.740
Here's that iron you were talking about.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.302
MATT: And and the scent is intoxicating.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:16.106
Where are the rest of you guys?

00:44:16.106 --> 00:44:16.939
Are going to try again?

00:44:16.939 --> 00:44:18.089
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it another go.

00:44:18.089 --> 00:44:19.470
MATT: Go for it, Caduceus.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.300
MARISHA: Maybe if you push?

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.390
TALIESIN: Better.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:23.505
Five.

00:44:23.505 --> 00:44:24.650
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Oh!

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.490
LIAM: It's, like, a centimeter.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:28.745
An inch.

00:44:28.745 --> 00:44:31.085
SAM: I can't wait for this whole sequence to be animated.

00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:33.450
TALIESIN: Got to twist back and forth.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.120
Has anyone got, like, a rag or something?

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.530
I can get a better grip.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.807
TRAVIS: A rag?!
(laughter)

00:44:38.807 --> 00:44:40.932
TRAVIS: Like opening a jar of pickles.

00:44:40.932 --> 00:44:42.690
(laughter)

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.900
TRAVIS: Who's got a washcloth?

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.910
SAM: Sometimes you can dent the lid

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.198
because you have a little extra grip.

00:44:50.198 --> 00:44:51.510
TRAVIS: He's rolling!

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.870
MATT: You take another four points of fire damage

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:53.830
from the torchblooms

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.282
as you squeezed in there.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:55.282 --> 00:44:58.180
MATT: The serpent's going to strike
back at your form once more.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.013
That is not so great.

00:44:59.013 --> 00:44:59.930
That is a 14 to hit.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.260
LIAM: Still hits.
MATT: Still hits.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.340
TALIESIN: Sharks are easy to hit.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.915
MATT: You take--
TRAVIS: When they're stuck in a tunnel.

00:45:05.915 --> 00:45:06.965
(laughter)

00:45:06.965 --> 00:45:08.139
TRAVIS: Right in front of you.

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:10.502
MATT: 13 points of piercing damage.

00:45:10.502 --> 00:45:11.890
TRAVIS: I'm going to getcha!

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.740
MATT: And five points of fire damage.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.889
LIAM: Oh man.

00:45:14.889 --> 00:45:17.488
The shark's bloodied.
TRAVIS: (chomping)

00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:22.305
LIAM: Bite it.
MATT: Go for it. (laughs)

00:45:22.305 --> 00:45:23.729
TRAVIS: Y'all just sitting there.

00:45:23.729 --> 00:45:24.940
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.140
LAURA: None of us even know what's happening.
TRAVIS: It's in a tunnel.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.280
MATT: This is the weirdest version of--

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.680
TRAVIS: If you line up two Hungry Hungry Hippos.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.040
LIAM: It's just like when I hold my wiener dog,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.730
and he's like (snarling)
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.360
LIAM: 14.
MATT: 14.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.065
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.140
LIAM: 14 points of damage.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.046
MATT: How do you want to do this?

00:45:44.046 --> 00:45:45.236
(cheering)

00:45:45.236 --> 00:45:46.577
LIAM: I'm going to eat him.

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.410
MATT: And you do.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.770
(crunching) Once again, all the water

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.420
in front of you is now clouded with the remains

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.290
of this fiery serpent thing that you've now swallowed.

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:59.367
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, and I just sit there thinking: apex predator.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.270
And that's all I do.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:06.510
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: I'm not that bright right now.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.300
MATT: Do make-- I should have been keeping up with this.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.780
Do make a couple of concentration checks for me.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.800
LIAM: Great, oh, sure.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.440
MATT: Using the constitution of the shark.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.490
LIAM: Of the shark, okay.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.610
That is a

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.810
13.
MATT: Okay, that would have

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.710
been fine, next one.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.770
LIAM: That is a nine.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.110
MATT: Okay, so we'll say at this point,

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.690
you lose concentration from the last

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.330
moment you guys strike simultaneously,

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.540
and then (shoop) revert back to your from.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.630
LIAM: Apex predat-- ah! <i>Scheiße</i>.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.750
Back the other way, wrong way, wrong way.

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:40.050
MATT: Caduceus has a heavy hold on your ankle

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.423
and pulls you immediately back into the space.

00:46:43.423 --> 00:46:44.556
LIAM: Seems uncalled for.

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.870
LAURA: I'm assuming we're the opposite lineup now, right?

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.970
So Fjord or Yasha and

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.480
Veth are leading the way?

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.830
TALIESIN: Just at least to backup.
ASHLEY: We can do that.

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:55.980
MATT: Correct.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.630
So you guys slowly make way back into the tunnel.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:01.070
And are you continuing to lead, Caleb?

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.090
LIAM: Yeah, I will--

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.650
yeah. I'll drag my way up to the front.

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:04.820
I'm not speedy anymore

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.730
until I cast Expeditious Retreat again, and now I am.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:08.563
MATT: All righty.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.630
That lasts for how long?

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.200
LIAM: 10 minutes.
MATT: 10 minutes, you got it.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.880
All right, so putting that up again for another casting,

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.010
that puts you at the front.

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:17.230
For this next leg,

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.840
for the 20 minutes sequence,

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.640
go ahead and make another survival check with advantage.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.090
LIAM: I turn into a blue whale.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.793
Natural 20.

00:47:23.793 --> 00:47:26.150
SAM: Ooh, yeah.
ASHLEY: Nice!

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.050
MATT: Pushing forward, you guys

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.670
feel the water getting cooler

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:32.050
and cooler still, and you're sensing the proximity

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.740
to your exit is getting closer and closer

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.480
and anticipation begins to rise up from inside, and

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.310
the excitement and the hope for the coming

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:44.440
restful exhale is not that far off the distance.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.782
Go ahead and make one more check with advantage to see.

00:47:50.226 --> 00:47:52.500
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15!

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.480
Pushing in that final leg,

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.940
you eventually curve downward and peer into

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.050
a separation of the torchbloom

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.680
and darkness of an interior chamber beyond that.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.170
And as you emerge into the underwater portion

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.950
of the cavern in which the ships are kept,

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.900
you lead the rest of the party out to freedom

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.230
in the much colder waters,

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.062
from the underground inlet here.

00:48:21.593 --> 00:48:24.657
LIAM: (exhales) Like a Zemnian clock.

00:48:24.657 --> 00:48:26.160
TRAVIS: Well done.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.200
SAM: What a fucking plan!

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.480
MARISHA: Wow.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.010
We did it.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.540
We made four plans and abandoned all of them,

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.430
but we did it.
SAM: Yes!

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:37.800
TRAVIS: Now that we broke the surface,

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.680
are things still falling from the ceiling?

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.665
And how many ships are still there?

00:48:42.665 --> 00:48:44.106
MATT: Things aren't falling from the ceiling.

00:48:44.106 --> 00:48:45.972
The chamber is filled with smoke.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.160
It is a little hard to breathe.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.400
You can breathe better underwater

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.390
with your water breathing spell,

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:53.970
because the burning ships are in an enclosed space,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.380
with a little bit of smoke that's coming out

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.440
from the sides of the waterfall

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.870
and the illusionary exit there.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.730
TALIESIN: We should put the fires out, maybe, at this point.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:03.563
LAURA: How?

00:49:03.563 --> 00:49:05.220
MATT: But you see the fire has spread

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.170
beyond the secondary ship.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:09.840
Which was the sea Banshee, I believe, right?

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.506
LAURA: Can you Control Water anymore?
LIAM: I think so,

00:49:11.506 --> 00:49:12.900
It was Fiona and the one next to it.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.190
MATT: Right.
SAM: It was the Banshee, yeah.

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:16.590
MATT: Yeah, and so now that has spread to the Kingfisher.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:18.030
SAM: Oh no.
LIAM: How's our big boat?

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.670
LAURA: I can try using my 6th-level as the Control Water

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.520
and lift up the water to try

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.110
to put out the fires on the boats.

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:28.840
LIAM: I can also use Control Flames to put fire out as well.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.230
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: Five feet at a time.

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:33.128
MATT: Right, so it'll take you a little bit to do so. Okay.

00:49:33.128 --> 00:49:36.068
TALIESIN: I don't have Control Water,
but that's pretty good plan,

00:49:36.068 --> 00:49:38.230
is to just to create--
LAURA: Oh wait, do I have it?

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:39.180
TALIESIN: -- or something, I don't know.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.770
LAURA: Yeah, I have it prepared, so I could do that.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.970
MATT: Okay, let's go and do that then.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:47.190
MARISHA: I swim to one of the edges of the boats

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.570
and just start splashing it.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.660
MATT: Paddling water onto it, (splashing) one at a time.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.600
Fair enough.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.760
LAURA: I want to bring up a water tornado

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.200
and bring it down.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.866
MATT: (splashing) Onto it.

00:49:58.866 --> 00:50:01.660
We'll say between the spellcraft

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.265
and the concentrated splashing--

00:50:03.265 --> 00:50:04.500
MARISHA: Yes, spellcraft.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.090
Yes, that is what I'm doing.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.750
Look at my spell craft.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.200
MATT: You eventually begin to douse

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.550
the majority of the flames that are here bringing it to

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.150
somewhat waterlogged to cinders

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.620
and now elements of steam mixing with the smoke.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.430
It is still a relatively unhappy place to be

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.425
for a short while.

00:50:23.425 --> 00:50:24.690
But best to your knowledge, the ships

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:25.760
that have survived any damage

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.440
are the Mistral, the Drunken Mariner,

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.200
a handful of smaller fishing boats

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.338
and the Eden's Horizon.

00:50:31.338 --> 00:50:33.640
SAM and MARISHA: Yes!
(clapping)

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.410
LAURA: Nein Heroez.

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.880
LIAM: As I put out fires, I find it very hard

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.482
not to start them on other boats.

00:50:40.482 --> 00:50:42.207
The urge is quite strong.

00:50:42.207 --> 00:50:43.950
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.200
SAM: Wow!
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.430
SAM: What a day.
TRAVIS: Right.

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.720
So we should check on the exterior, right?

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.553
The village.
LAURA: We should see

00:50:51.553 --> 00:50:53.000
how the village.
LIAM: Oh, yes we should.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.780
SAM: Also, the village might be

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.130
in chaos right now.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:57.020
They all just woke up

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.690
from the worst dream.
MARISHA: Yeah, if they're rioting.

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:00.523
MATT: Vilya goes--

00:51:00.523 --> 00:51:03.900
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.
MATT: "You're probably right.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.100
"Oh dear."

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:09.260
MARISHA: Can you do the tree porty,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.570
walking through thing??
MATT: "I can once we get,

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:13.520
"once again, to a tree."

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.460
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "So let us try

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.160
"and swim out then, I suppose."

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.863
TRAVIS: Oh, nobody has Control Water anymore.

00:51:19.863 --> 00:51:21.029
LAURA: Oops!

00:51:21.029 --> 00:51:22.745
SAM: I have Shape Water.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:25.560
TRAVIS: Will that work

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.040
with a giant fire hydrant waterfall?

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.873
SAM: Well, I can--

00:51:29.873 --> 00:51:31.196
TRAVIS: We might all just be going for a ride.
SAM: I can change

00:51:31.196 --> 00:51:32.625
the flow of water in a

00:51:32.625 --> 00:51:35.239
five-foot cube.
LIAM: Finally get to do it.

00:51:35.239 --> 00:51:36.364
TRAVIS: Nope!

00:51:36.364 --> 00:51:38.690
SAM: So like that little bit,

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.180
I could just, like, woop.
ASHLEY: Let's go for a ride.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.780
LAURA: Yeah, we're going to have to go for a ride.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.440
MARISHA: I go ahead and I swim towards it.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.330
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:47.680
MARISHA: I'm so excited.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.270
LAURA: We just got to go for it.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:51.620
MATT: You guys all gather and bundle up,

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.400
right at the base of where the waterfall is.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.650
You can hear the rushing water just shooting by.

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.860
SAM: I'm still going to use Shape Water,

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.630
but I'm going to use it to change the color of the water

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:03.521
around Fjord to yellow.

00:52:03.521 --> 00:52:05.196
(laughter)

00:52:05.196 --> 00:52:06.498
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: No, it's not me.

00:52:06.498 --> 00:52:07.450
No, no, it's not.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:08.970
It's--
LAURA: That's really strong.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.600
SAM: Oh boy, that's a nice flow.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.050
TRAVIS: You don't see-- you can't see
actual urine in the water.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.380
SAM: Why is it coming out of your elbow?

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.681
LIAM: No one darest judge this man.

00:52:18.681 --> 00:52:21.070
(laughter)

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.516
MARISHA: You should drink more water though, just saying,

00:52:23.516 --> 00:52:26.284
it's very yellow.
TRAVIS: My kidneys are failing.

00:52:26.284 --> 00:52:28.620
LIAM: It was a rough day.
TRAVIS: It was.

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.220
Are we really going through with this?

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.170
LAURA: There's no other choice, I don't think.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.003
TRAVIS: All right, Beau first.

00:52:33.003 --> 00:52:35.440
SAM: I feel like someone's going to turn into a bird, right,

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.290
and do this whole.
TALIESIN: I think I might

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.100
have an idea.
LAURA: What?

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.380
SAM: Oh boy.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.521
TALIESIN: Wait.

00:52:41.521 --> 00:52:43.888
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh good, uh-huh.

00:52:45.977 --> 00:52:47.802
TALIESIN: So we have a burned boat.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:50.230
LAURA: Oh!

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.320
Just ride a boat out.

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.460
TALIESIN: We could just, maybe just like a dam,

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.570
except that the river is going up.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.250
TRAVIS: I don't know if I want
to be free falling with a ship.

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.120
TALIESIN: No, no, no, we just break up the water.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.810
It probably isn't powerful enough to, like, lift--

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:09.402
I mean, it may be able to lift it,
I don't know, but might not.

00:53:10.616 --> 00:53:12.350
MARISHA: How about this?

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.698
I'm going to go on ahead,

00:53:14.698 --> 00:53:17.920
and I'll watch from the other side,

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.572
just in case.

00:53:19.572 --> 00:53:21.100
TALIESIN: I don't see how that helps, but I trust you.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.170
MARISHA: It's not. (poofing) And I swim into it.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:24.400
TALIESIN: Oh!
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.370
MATT: Okay.

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:27.700
So are you trying to fight the current?

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.670
MARISHA: No.

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:31.302
MATT: You watch as Beauregard goes, "All right." (zooming)

00:53:31.302 --> 00:53:33.950
And is, just like any sort of vacuum tube,

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.580
it all of a sudden just fires off. You know, Augustus Gloop

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.217
in Willy Wonka--
TRAVIS: Monks, man.

00:53:38.217 --> 00:53:40.240
MATT: -- she just vanishes upward.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.749
You Beauregard.
LAURA: You Beauregard.

00:53:42.749 --> 00:53:44.090
(laughter)

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.163
LIAM: Beauregard.
SAM: Me Matt.

00:53:46.163 --> 00:53:50.710
MATT: You Beauregard like you wouldn't believe.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.750
LIAM: Imagine if she shot up and hit the ceiling

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:57.220
and reverse Keylethed.
(laughter)

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.570
MATT: I'm not done.
LAURA: Oh no.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.430
MARISHA: Oh! Don't put ideas in his head.
MATT: No.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:07.320
So Beauregard, the first sensation that hits you,

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.140
you know when you all of a sudden catch a hose

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:13.500
or something and water shoots into your nose and mouth

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.500
and just completely waterlogs your sinuses?

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.300
MARISHA: I do, I've been tubing.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.133
MATT and MARISHA: Yes.

00:54:19.133 --> 00:54:21.780
MATT: It's that times 100.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.970
It is such a volume of force--

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:29.290
wasabi could not clear your nose this strong,

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:34.370
and you are tossed like a rag doll upward.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:36.500
Make a dexterity check, because from this perspective,

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.990
you are being shot towards the top mouth of the cavern.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.670
MARISHA: Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.230
A saving throw or just a straight check?

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:46.063
LIAM: Oh no.

00:54:46.063 --> 00:54:48.520
MATT: A dexterity saving throw.
MARISHA: A saving throw.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.070
LIAM: Oh no.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.890
20.
MATT: 20.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:55.662
You do not collide with the rock surface of the cavern.

00:54:55.662 --> 00:54:59.167
Instead, you just get flung at an intense speed.

00:54:59.167 --> 00:55:01.970
As soon as your vision comes back

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:05.480
from the intense spray of water into your face and nose,

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.720
you feel that gentle drifting sensation

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.460
of flying then falling.

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:15.280
At this height, you have about 40 or 50 or so

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.350
arcing feet to drop.

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.450
MARISHA: I'm trying to go for that upper level.

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:20.283
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:21.640
Oh, you're far above the upper level,

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.470
you're just landing now amongst the rock and pools.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:25.440
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do a nice little swan dive

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.110
into a full, you know, 360 degree front flip

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:32.070
and three point landing.
MATT: You got it.

00:55:34.773 --> 00:55:36.630
24 points of bludgeoning damage,

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.098
which, I believe with your Slow Fall,

00:55:39.098 --> 00:55:40.790
means nothing.

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:41.623
MARISHA: In a puddle,

00:55:41.623 --> 00:55:45.210
so barely any water splashes around me

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.700
and I land just that gracefully.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:48.985
TALIESIN: A vibration pool, where it's just

00:55:48.985 --> 00:55:50.850
like vroom, vroom, vroom.
MARISHA: Yeah, that's it.

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:52.881
LIAM: Why didn't Keyleth turn into a monk?

00:55:52.881 --> 00:55:55.460
(laughter)
MARISHA: I don't-- (laughs)

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.700
TRAVIS: What's the height that she got shot up to?

00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.910
MARISHA: The only thing I couldn't do.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:02.220
TRAVIS: Max, how high was she from the ground?

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:06.300
MATT: Oh, from what you saw, it was about about 55, 60 feet

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.290
from the bottom of the actual surface of the water

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.260
to the rock ceiling at this point,

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.490
because it is curved down a little bit,

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:14.310
it's around 70 to 80 feet at some points in the tunnel,

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:15.380
the further back it gets,

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.590
that's about 55, 60 feet right here,

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.690
the apex of the entrance and then she went (zooming),

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:20.620
right past it.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.360
TRAVIS: And she went 40 or 50 feet above that?

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.195
TALIESIN: I still like my burned boat idea.
MATT: You don't know where she went.

00:56:24.195 --> 00:56:25.730
She went out of your visual range.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.190
TRAVIS: What about the previous time,

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.440
when we were first coming here,

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:32.120
because we saw you go (zooming), like a fucking ragdoll.

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.248
MATT: That's right.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:33.248 --> 00:56:35.970
MATT: It's over 100 feet.
LAURA: Dude, then we can't, no.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:37.950
ASHLEY: We can also try to hold on to each other

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.820
and make ourselves weigh more so we don't, you know.

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:41.820
TALIESIN: I still like the boat idea.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.480
LAURA: I think we should do the boat thing.

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.744
ASHLEY: Boat idea it is.

00:56:45.744 --> 00:56:49.670
SAM: Boy, that is a bad idea.

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:51.162
ASHLEY: I mean, it's--
SAM: It just seems,

00:56:51.162 --> 00:56:56.162
LIAM: Eh, if we can move a boat and have it act as a plug,

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:58.170
it would take me a few minutes,

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:02.250
but I could actually open the front of the ship

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:04.990
and just make us a hole to walk through,

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:08.280
provided the boat is blocking the--

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.940
SAM: Oh, so, like, we wedge it in?

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.640
LIAM: We wedge it in there

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.540
and then I just part the front of the boat

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.373
and we go through that.

00:57:14.373 --> 00:57:16.039
LAURA: It's going to break the boat apart.
TRAVIS: I think its going to explode

00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:18.140
the ship or send it up, I think.

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:19.940
TALIESIN: Well, let's--
LIAM: How wide

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.560
is this geyser of water?
TRAVIS: Good question.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.892
Ship wide. (laughs)

00:57:23.892 --> 00:57:26.648
MATT: From side to side, the geyser is about--

00:57:28.432 --> 00:57:30.762
I'm trying to remember the exact--

00:57:30.762 --> 00:57:32.620
about 15-20 feet wide.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.147
LIAM: That's huge.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay,

00:57:35.147 --> 00:57:36.363
I have an idea,

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.500
I have an idea.

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:43.000
I'm going to go up to the cavern wall next to the waterfall.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.833
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:48.190
LAURA: Hey, Fjord, you're a strong swimmer.

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:49.320
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: Will you hold onto

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.080
my legs so you can hold me steady

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.430
in this water so I don't fall?

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.630
TRAVIS: You want me in the water?

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.310
LAURA: Well yeah, because there's no edge here.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.260
TRAVIS: Oh sure.
LAURA: So, I'm going to have

00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.710
be treading water to do this,

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.580
so you hold me so I don't have to tread.

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:02.590
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: Okay,

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:04.743
and then I'm going to use my paints.

00:58:04.743 --> 00:58:09.743
I'm going to paint a tunnel, so I can see the outside.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.310
SAM: You're painting on water?

00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:13.501
LAURA: No, I'm going to paint on the rock,

00:58:13.501 --> 00:58:14.867
next to the waterfall.

00:58:14.867 --> 00:58:16.640
I'm just going to try to paint a little tunnel

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.010
so we can all fit through.

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.570
I know what it looks like outside of there,

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:21.550
so I'm going to.
MATT: Okay.

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:23.700
Yeah, that may uses a little bit, decent amount of paint.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.390
So go ahead and mark down...

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:28.125
How much paint do you have left currently?

00:58:28.125 --> 00:58:29.870
SAM: Tons.
LAURA: A lot.

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:31.890
MATT: A lot?
LIAM: Fucking tons.

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:34.670
LAURA: I haven't been using it.
SAM: She's used, like, ten,

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:36.520
ten out of a thousand or something.

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.570
MATT: I'd say it's, I'd say about--
LAURA: 10 square feet,

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:41.150
20 square feet?
MATT: About 10 square feet.

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:43.240
LAURA: 10 square feet, okay.

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.330
MATT: So you guys take a moment

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:47.370
and watch her as she goes into lights

00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:51.430
and shading and the horizon line with the water,

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.650
draws a little bird flying, you know,

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:58.057
does a picturesque, quite beautiful painting.

00:58:59.014 --> 00:59:01.160
And as you're taking in the details of it,

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.125
they begin to become clear.

00:59:04.471 --> 00:59:05.496
And then you pull back,

00:59:05.496 --> 00:59:07.370
like looking too close at a Monet,

00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:08.590
that looks just like dots of color

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.910
and then you pull back and it is an image,

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:12.813
you back up a little bit

00:59:12.813 --> 00:59:14.498
and it's just a hole

00:59:14.498 --> 00:59:15.970
in the rock.
ASHLEY: Whoa.

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.250
SAM: That's brilliant.
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.140
ASHLEY: Cool.
LAURA: Come on, you guys!

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.790
And I crawl through.
MATT: Okay.

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.060
So Beauregard, as you're waiting for all them

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:25.346
to come rocketing over the side. You watch them just

00:59:25.346 --> 00:59:27.870
casually stroll out onto the side of the rock. (laughs)

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:29.190
MARISHA: While I'm waiting for them,

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:31.990
can I actually peek up at the volcano

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:34.030
and see if I see any lava flows?

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:35.330
MATT: Yeah.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:37.760
The smoke emerging from the volcano,

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.532
and there is still smoke,
but it is more of a gray-white smoke

00:59:41.532 --> 00:59:43.440
which is different from the black

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.670
that has been steadily pouring from the active volcano

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:47.140
for quite some time.

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.840
You do see, along the the volcanic surface

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.733
and the sides of it, that gets a little more black

00:59:54.733 --> 00:59:57.590
and there are sources of black smoke

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.770
coming up from the sides of the mountain from all over,

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.620
so it does look like it was--

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.918
MARISHA: It was flowing.
MATT: It was flowing.

01:00:02.918 --> 01:00:04.280
MARISHA: Okay.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.113
Okay.

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.850
MATT: So you guys all emerge, and when you emerge

01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:10.070
it's not like there's a little platform there,

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:13.980
you have probably a good 10 or so feet

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.410
before you can begin to find footings,

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.390
so you're having to step out of the hole

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.090
and grasp on and a little bit of rock climbing

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.890
to the side until you get to,

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:21.960
or you can just jump into the water,

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.090
it's up to you.

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.585
LAURA: No, I'm going to avoid the water.

01:00:24.585 --> 01:00:27.120
I don't want to get sucked up into that geyser by mistake.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.540
MATT: All right.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.890
So you guys climb alongside

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:33.660
and eventually make your way over onto a safer part

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.180
within the rocky lagoon walls,

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.350
not too far from the beach

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:40.030
where you've now spent two evenings of rest.

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:41.130
Beauregard.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:45.256
You see them all gathering down over from here.

01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:47.320
MARISHA: Oh, I'm, hey.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.290
I'm up here.
TRAVIS: Can opener!

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:51.720
ASHLEY: You okay?
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm great.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.020
How are you guys?
TRAVIS: Jump!

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.360
MARISHA: Oh am I-- I'm coming down to you,

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.990
you're not coming up to me?

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:59.120
LAURA: That seems like way more effort.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.460
TRAVIS: Cannonball!

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.110
MARISHA: Okay, coming.

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.166
I jump. Yasha, catch me!

01:01:08.357 --> 01:01:09.920
SAM: Oh boy.
(laughter)

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.470
MATT: You go out and-- Do you jump into the water

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:12.520
to try and catch her?

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.493
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:01:14.493 --> 01:01:15.503
(laughter)

01:01:15.503 --> 01:01:18.236
TRAVIS: Yeah! (swimming)

01:01:18.236 --> 01:01:20.900
LIAM: They pass each other. (laughs)

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.460
ASHLEY: We have clerics.
MATT: Yeah.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.320
All right
TRAVIS: "We have clerics."

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.630
MATT: As you, Yasha, wade out a little bit

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.290
and try and position yourself,

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:32.350
Beauregard vanishes back over the edge of the rock

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:35.441
and there's a few moments where you're like,

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:37.341
"Is she going to--

01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:38.725
"is she--" Boof!
MARISHA: (screaming)

01:01:38.725 --> 01:01:41.450
MATT: And you see her, after her running jump, leaps

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:43.830
and goes into, is it a cannonball or is it a can opener,

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.280
what are you doing?
LAURA: Oh god.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.220
MATT: Or are you just being caught?

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.370
TRAVIS: Plank it. Just fucking belly flop.

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.558
LIAM: Do the Keyleth!
TRAVIS: From 50 feet.

01:01:50.558 --> 01:01:52.049
MARISHA: If I did a belly flop, that's--

01:01:52.049 --> 01:01:53.532
I've done that, that's horrible.

01:01:53.532 --> 01:01:55.400
TRAVIS: Egg, do the egg.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.530
MATT: Yasha's going to try and catch you,

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:57.820
so what do you think would be most--?

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.160
SAM: Oh god.
MARISHA: I try and turn over

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.410
and do the damsel in distress,

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.590
like, Godzilla whole fall, like catch me.

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.070
ASHLEY: I'm seeing her position.

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:10.557
I'm like: Okay.

01:02:10.557 --> 01:02:13.350
TRAVIS: From how high?!
MARISHA: Very high.

01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:17.076
MATT: From up where she is, it's about 70, 75 feet.

01:02:17.076 --> 01:02:18.025
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:19.646
SAM: That's how Yasha lost her arm.

01:02:19.646 --> 01:02:23.050
(laughter)
TRAVIS: You know you rotate, right,

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:24.020
as you fall?
MATT: Yeah.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.270
SAM: She's a monk.
TRAVIS: Usually towards the direction

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.103
of your head.
MARISHA: Yeah, I

01:02:27.103 --> 01:02:28.798
you know, I do a few rotations.

01:02:28.798 --> 01:02:32.196
ASHLEY: How far up is she?
MATT: About 70-75 feet.

01:02:32.196 --> 01:02:33.305
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh!

01:02:33.305 --> 01:02:35.167
LIAM: End over end.
TRAVIS: Oh man!

01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:36.990
MARISHA: You're going to catch me, right?

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.880
ASHLEY: I'm going to catch you for sure.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.011
TRAVIS: Just start swimming away.
(laughter)

01:02:43.011 --> 01:02:43.994
LIAM: You're going to hold that football

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:46.461
right, Lucy?
MATT: You're getting closer and closer.

01:02:47.817 --> 01:02:49.457
ASHLEY: I want to try something.
MATT: What are you going to try?

01:02:49.457 --> 01:02:51.613
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
LIAM: Skingorger.

01:02:51.613 --> 01:02:54.080
(laughter)

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.230
MATT: Fruit Ninja her in the middle of the air.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.230
ASHLEY: This is the weirdest way to try this,

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:02.990
but I kind of want to see--

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:04.590
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Oh, do it!

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:08.957
ASHLEY: -- if the wings are real,
so I might want to try to meet her.

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.823
MATT: Okay.

01:03:10.823 --> 01:03:14.992
So you go ahead and as she's falling, you

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:16.130
attempt to release.

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:17.400
ASHLEY: I want to tell everybody:

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.487
Wait, what is that over there?!

01:03:19.487 --> 01:03:20.750
Try to make everybody not see.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:21.583
TRAVIS: Look away?

01:03:21.583 --> 01:03:23.750
MATT: Make it a deception check, Yasha.

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:24.583
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:28.692
MATT: Against everybody else's passive insight.

01:03:28.692 --> 01:03:30.502
ASHLEY: Um, um, um!

01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:32.622
Oh, I have a minus two for deception.

01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:33.740
MATT: You'll be fine.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.217
ASHLEY: 10.
MATT: 10.

01:03:36.217 --> 01:03:39.625
LAURA: We all stare at you.
MATT: Everybody stares at you.

01:03:39.625 --> 01:03:41.707
(laughter)

01:03:41.707 --> 01:03:42.723
TALIESIN: I wasn't even looking.

01:03:42.723 --> 01:03:44.972
ASHLEY: Can't believe it's the
first time I've tried to use these.

01:03:44.972 --> 01:03:47.250
MATT: I know.
TRAVIS: That sounds like a lie.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.310
MATT: So you shout, "Hey, look over there!" Nobody looks.

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:50.381
Are you still doing it?

01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:52.120
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.830
ASHLEY: Let's see.
MATT: You watch as Yasha,

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.630
looking up, glancing up towards Beauregard,

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:56.880
her attention refocusing,

01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:59.380
takes a deep breath,

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.990
and then, from behind (wings unfurling)

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:03.780
these wings emerge.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:08.780
Not the blackened, necrotic, dead wings that you're used to,

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.970
this terrifying visage,

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:15.720
but from what you can see, these beautiful, bright white,

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.349
almost gold, sparkling feathered wings

01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:20.690
(wings unfurling) emerge.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.150
And as they (flapping) once,

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.390
it gives you just enough of a boost

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:30.090
where you lift from the water about five to eight feet

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:32.210
and put your arms out to try and catch her

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:33.670
as she comes down.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:35.670
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.492
LAURA: Oh my god!
TRAVIS: Dope moment!

01:04:38.492 --> 01:04:39.850
LIAM: I lean in next to Fjord and say:

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:43.139
This is the weirdest mating dance I have ever seen.

01:04:43.139 --> 01:04:44.140
(laughter)

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.630
ASHLEY: 19.

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:47.666
MATT: 19.
SAM: First good roll ever.

01:04:48.616 --> 01:04:50.591
ASHLEY: Say again?
SAM: First good roll ever.

01:04:50.591 --> 01:04:53.294
ASHLEY: Yeah, first good roll since-- for a long time.

01:04:53.294 --> 01:04:55.040
MATT: So that reduces the damage you both take.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.160
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.205
TRAVIS: Yeah, because she's rocketing towards you.

01:04:58.205 --> 01:04:59.580
ASHLEY: Yeah, she's rocketing.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.140
TRAVIS: Off-kilter.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.973
Like the worst knuckleball of a human being ever.

01:05:04.973 --> 01:05:06.148
MARISHA: Still Slow Fall.

01:05:06.148 --> 01:05:07.490
LIAM: Picking up momentum every--

01:05:08.782 --> 01:05:10.706
ASHLEY: Sounds like a lot of stuff.
TRAVIS: (whooshing)

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.531
MATT: It'd be 27 points of bludgeoning damage

01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:14.088
reduced to half because of your roll,

01:05:14.088 --> 01:05:15.700
that brings it to 13.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.950
So you both take 13 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:20.560
I would say Slow Fall would help you,

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.670
but you are intentionally not trying to slow your fall,

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:25.690
so you both take 13 points

01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:26.980
of bludgeoning damage.
MARISHA: I'll take it.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.300
MATT: And as the impact hits, as it (grunts)

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.580
and you watch as Yasha, her physicality,

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.250
strains with the impact,

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:38.810
but she maintains form, holding Beau

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:40.920
and then the wings (flapping),

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.700
as she lowers back down into the water

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.740
and the wings fold behind

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.520
as they're now both in the lagoon below.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.226
SAM: That was exceptionally hot.
LAURA: That was beautiful!

01:05:50.226 --> 01:05:52.140
That was beautiful!
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.630
ASHLEY: You're okay?

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.820
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.510
So did we want to go back to the village, or?
LAURA: You have wings!

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:58.930
SAM: Hey, you have--!
LAURA: You have wings!

01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.770
MARISHA: Can we talk about that some more?

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:02.420
TRAVIS: You flew!

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.740
ASHLEY: I--

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.440
MARISHA: How long is this been a thing?

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.440
ASHLEY: I don't know.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.440
I had a dream on the ship and I--

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.970
I didn't know if it was real or not,

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:19.970
so I thought, it might be a good time to try,

01:06:20.157 --> 01:06:23.432
but I didn't know it would work.

01:06:24.422 --> 01:06:25.860
MARISHA: It worked, yeah.

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:26.693
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:06:28.474 --> 01:06:29.590
SAM: Do you feel different?

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:33.247
Are you a bird or something? Are you okay?

01:06:34.209 --> 01:06:36.739
MARISHA: I think she's an angel.
ASHLEY: I don't feel any different.

01:06:36.739 --> 01:06:38.540
LAURA: You're an angel, Yasha!
LIAM: You dreamed you had wings,

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.107
and then you had them?

01:06:42.779 --> 01:06:45.420
ASHLEY: I've never had them before.

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.295
I mean, they I've always been just kind of

01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:51.002
weird and strange.

01:06:51.002 --> 01:06:53.518
LIAM: And you've no idea why you have them?

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.550
ASHLEY: No, I didn't know this was possible.

01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:03.550
I mean, I just-- I thought it wouldn't hurt to try

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:07.451
to bamf them out to catch Beau.

01:07:07.451 --> 01:07:09.070
If it didn't happen then you know, it didn't happen,

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.527
we would fall in water.
TRAVIS: She just dies, big deal.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:11.439
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: I wouldn't have died.

01:07:11.439 --> 01:07:14.472
I-I would've-- I (pfft).

01:07:14.472 --> 01:07:15.960
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't know.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.280
MATT: So as you're holding Beauregard,

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.280
you're still hovering right above the water's surface.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.430
As you're having this conversation

01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:23.861
while they're talking at you,

01:07:23.861 --> 01:07:25.517
and you're nervously talking

01:07:25.517 --> 01:07:27.070
and answering their questions,

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.130
you don't realize until a moment later

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:31.950
as you still begin to hear the (wings flapping).

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.120
TRAVIS: Holy.
SAM: Whoa.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.101
LAURA: You can fly!
MARISHA: You can fly!

01:07:36.101 --> 01:07:39.440
ALL: ♪ You can fly, you can fly, you can fly! ♪

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.673
LAURA: Yasha!

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:42.701
ASHLEY: Oh my!

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.610
I'm going to stay and try to fly around a little bit.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:48.650
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: No.

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:50.160
TRAVIS: No fucking way.
MARISHA: Can you carry me?

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.301
I just hold on to her neck.

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:54.061
(laughter)
SAM: Yeah you do!

01:07:54.061 --> 01:07:55.836
MARISHA: Kind of squeeze into her a little.

01:07:55.836 --> 01:07:57.583
MATT: You just start flying around?

01:07:57.583 --> 01:08:00.258
What are you doing? Where are you trying to fly?

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.080
ASHLEY: I don't know!

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.580
I-- (laughs)

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.480
I just want to go up over the waterfall

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.405
and maybe look up over the volcano.

01:08:11.405 --> 01:08:15.315
LAURA: ♪ Can you feel the love tonight? ♪

01:08:15.315 --> 01:08:16.797
MATT: You guys watch as Yasha just

01:08:16.797 --> 01:08:20.200
takes off.
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.970
MATT: Up, over the waterfall, above the rocky pools above

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:26.940
and begins to coast up above the edge of the volcano,

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:27.960
as you're just soaring

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.860
it's this incredible sense of freedom.

01:08:31.005 --> 01:08:33.765
(laughter)

01:08:33.765 --> 01:08:35.495
It does last for one minute, so the wings suddenly (poof).

01:08:35.495 --> 01:08:36.962
SAM: Ah!
LAURA: No!

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.793
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:08:40.402 --> 01:08:41.510
Well, we won't get too far.

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:43.300
MATT: So you get a little ways up there.

01:08:44.818 --> 01:08:45.868
MARISHA: This is incredible.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.090
ASHLEY: Uh oh, uh oh, it's going away,

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:52.090
it's going away.
MATT: The feathers suddenly vanish

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:56.590
and the wings fade away into radiant outlines

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:57.980
and then are gone

01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.998
and you both begin to plummet.

01:08:59.998 --> 01:09:00.950
ASHLEY: Oh no!

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:04.700
SAM: Are they directly above us or are they elsewhere?

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.950
MATT: You said you were going up over the waterfall

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:09.936
and up along the volcano a little bit.

01:09:09.936 --> 01:09:11.136
ASHLEY: So we'd be on those first pools.

01:09:11.136 --> 01:09:12.500
MATT: So you're a little bit above the pools,

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.050
so you're not terribly high.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.130
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.430
MATT: 30 feet per round, I'd put that at about--

01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:22.730
You're about 90 or so feet above the water pools.

01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:25.500
TRAVIS: Sure.
ASHLEY: Oh boy. Okay.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.820
SAM: Above the upper level pools?

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.160
MATT: Yes.
SAM: So if they fall,

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.665
they will not come back down to us?

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.180
They're far away from us.
MATT: No.

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.300
They're way far away from you guys.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.530
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:35.170
MATT: So you guys are both plummeting.

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:36.003
What are you doing?

01:09:36.003 --> 01:09:36.950
TRAVIS: Can you see them?

01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:41.120
ASHLEY: I guess, we're falling into the water.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.500
MARISHA: It's just great.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.420
It's amazing, it's the best fall ever.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.710
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel fine, I feel good.

01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:48.850
TRAVIS: Is there water below you?

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.070
ASHLEY: There is.

01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:51.580
LAURA: Right? There's water below them.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.640
MATT: There are some pools of water,

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.530
so if you want to try and maneuver towards the surface

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:59.183
of the pool. You're uncertain of how shallow they are.

01:09:59.183 --> 01:10:01.967
TRAVIS: I played that in GTA;
it doesn't work like you think.

01:10:01.967 --> 01:10:03.480
(laughter)
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.200
I'll try and look and see if I can

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.830
maneuver my body weight while maybe grabbing Yasha

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:13.819
and yanking her over a pool that looks...

01:10:15.092 --> 01:10:16.360
deep.
TRAVIS: It's, like, three feet deep.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.870
MARISHA: Yeah, it's totally the shallow end.

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:20.630
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage,

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:22.060
because you're both tumbling

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.260
ass over tea kettle mid air.
MARISHA: That's fair.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.070
Ah, one of those was a natural 20,

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:28.870
but I'll take the 14 for 18.

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:30.250
MATT: 18, you do glance below

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.730
and you can see one of the larger rock pools

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:34.220
that you might be able to maneuver towards.

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.630
I need you both to make an athletics check,

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:38.272
or acrobatics.

01:10:38.272 --> 01:10:39.163
LIAM: Let's go, jocks.

01:10:39.163 --> 01:10:40.320
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.275
Yeah, let's go.
MARISHA: Acrobatics.

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:44.690
ASHLEY: Oh yes!
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:45.723
ALL: Ooh!

01:10:45.723 --> 01:10:46.955
ASHLEY: Natural 19.

01:10:46.955 --> 01:10:49.230
ALL: Ooh!
ASHLEY: 27.

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:50.260
MATT: All right.

01:10:51.265 --> 01:10:53.198
MARISHA: Like a Cirque show.

01:10:53.198 --> 01:10:55.690
Oh, it's just great.
MATT: You both go from

01:10:55.690 --> 01:11:00.690
this completely tangled dynamic mess.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.650
As you plummet, you both begin to form--

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:06.920
like molecules finding bonds,

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.220
you both become this structure

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.610
like arm and arm holding each other,

01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:12.710
looking at each other, looking down

01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:15.570
and maneuver at an angle until (splash)!

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:16.660
You both impact.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:20.100
It is about five feet deep, this pool.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.220
MARISHA: Okay. That's fine.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.940
MATT: But through that fall--

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:28.910
TRAVIS: Five feet deep?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:29.750
ASHLEY: This was dumb.

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:31.550
LIAM: You ever jump off a 20-foot diving board?

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:33.230
Remember how far down you go?
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:34.350
MARISHA: Those are terrifying.

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:37.805
LAURA: Oh god, that hurt so bad, you guys.

01:11:37.805 --> 01:11:39.673
MATT: 24 points of damage reduced to 12--

01:11:39.673 --> 01:11:41.393
SAM: Hey!
MATT: -- for each of you.

01:11:41.393 --> 01:11:43.310
MARISHA: No damage for me. Fall damage.
MATT: But you take none

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:46.023
because you were actively--
ASHLEY: Wait, you take--

01:11:46.023 --> 01:11:46.970
MARISHA: None.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.290
ASHLEY: You take none, great, yeah.

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.200
MATT: So you both (explosive splash)

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.200
catch down. The water splashes out to such an extent,

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.790
to where half of the pool is now gone.

01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:58.260
You guys have actually managed to diffuse

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.090
a majority of what made this pool

01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:03.440
and you feel the stone beneath you give slightly.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.590
TRAVIS: Uh oh. (laughs) Yeah.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.730
MARISHA: Are you okay?
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm okay.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.600
MARISHA: We should get out of here, yeah.
ASHLEY: That might not have been the

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.030
best idea, but that was--

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:13.034
MARISHA: That was amazing.
ASHLEY: Thanks for going on that ride with me.

01:12:13.034 --> 01:12:15.010
MARISHA: Thanks for taking me.

01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:17.170
Let's go, out of the pool, okay.

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:20.560
MATT: Okay, you both exit the the pool

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.880
and as you get a few steps away,

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.340
you hear this (slurping)

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.733
as you look behind, the pool just sinks in.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.250
LAURA: That would have sucked (laughs).

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.489
ASHLEY: Back into the--
TRAVIS: Cavern?

01:12:30.489 --> 01:12:32.449
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: You just destroyed all the ships.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:35.560
MATT: (laughs) As you return

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.100
to the mast of the Eden's Horizon just (impacts)!

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:42.940
No, but yeah, you both have a moment.

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:45.160
The adrenaline still coursing
through your system through that,

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.110
and you have another moment to

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.780
consider what just happened.

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.438
TRAVIS: Do we think they're coming back?

01:12:51.438 --> 01:12:52.853
TALIESIN: Yeah, they're fine.
SAM: They'll probably just jump back

01:12:52.853 --> 01:12:53.819
down again.
LAURA: Yeah, they're probably

01:12:53.819 --> 01:12:56.250
having a really fun trip right now.

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:57.810
SAM: If they jump down this time,

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:00.080
who will sprout wings to catch them?

01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:03.140
Fjord, would you like to try?

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.679
TRAVIS: I will take a pass.
SAM: Okay.

01:13:05.679 --> 01:13:06.837
TALIESIN: Is that a yes or no?

01:13:06.837 --> 01:13:10.760
Like, "take a pass at it" or you will take a pass?

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.595
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll try.
TALIESIN: Okay, good.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.317
Seems only reasonable.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.525
They're fine.

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:20.783
ASHLEY: Yeah, I didn't know.

01:13:20.783 --> 01:13:22.950
I didn't know if that would happen for sure.

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:27.710
But that's pretty cool.

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:29.760
MARISHA: What does it mean?
ASHLEY: I don't know.

01:13:33.869 --> 01:13:37.260
I honestly didn't know that that could ever happen to me.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:42.235
So, I'm confused,

01:13:42.235 --> 01:13:45.243
but I'm thankful.

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.857
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a relatable sentiment.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.990
Well, it's incredible.

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:58.710
ASHLEY: It's really cool.

01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:02.750
I didn't mean to make a big show of it.

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.060
But I mean, I did,

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.095
and-- but it's kind of cool.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.030
MARISHA: Thanks for taking me on your maiden flight.

01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:15.672
ASHLEY: Thanks for being my first passenger.

01:14:15.672 --> 01:14:19.400
(giggling)

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.882
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:14:21.882 --> 01:14:24.423
ASHLEY: Well, how are you feeling?

01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:26.728
MARISHA: Good-- gr-- yeah. Fu-- great.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:29.241
Um, uh--

01:14:29.241 --> 01:14:30.507
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: Probably better.

01:14:30.507 --> 01:14:33.107
(stammering) It's-- Long time. Good.

01:14:33.107 --> 01:14:34.348
Good long time.

01:14:34.348 --> 01:14:36.457
SAM: "Long time good."
ASHLEY: Yeah. Good, good long time.

01:14:36.457 --> 01:14:37.549
MARISHA: Good-- yeah.

01:14:37.549 --> 01:14:38.641
Better than--

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.217
SAM: (laughs)

01:14:41.217 --> 01:14:43.975
ASHLEY: Well, maybe

01:14:44.867 --> 01:14:46.234
we should go check,

01:14:46.234 --> 01:14:47.920
MARISHA: Yeah, the others, they might think

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.190
we're dead. (laughs)
ASHLEY: They probably

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:50.030
think we're dead,

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:52.960
which is probably not good.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.610
Probably not a good thing.

01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:58.733
MARISHA: Okay.

01:14:58.733 --> 01:15:00.791
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.
MARISHA: Let's go, okay.

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.866
ASHLEY: Okay, let's go.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.660
MATT: So are you guys-- are you slowly climbing down

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:07.860
the side of the mountainside

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.585
or are you jumping back in the water? What are you doing?

01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:11.927
ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean--
MARISHA: What?

01:15:11.927 --> 01:15:15.909
(laughter)

01:15:15.909 --> 01:15:17.209
SAM: Yeah, what?

01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:21.620
(laughter)

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.360
ASHLEY: Disasters.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.930
MATT: Are you climbing down the mountainside the long way?

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:28.130
Are you jumping down again?

01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:29.890
Like, are you just joining up with everybody else?

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:31.580
ASHLEY: If we jump again--
MARISHA: Yeah, we should

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.110
be safe about it.
ASHLEY: -- that might be not safe.

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:35.350
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll just--
MATT: All right.

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:37.920
ASHLEY: We've tested fate a little.
MATT: Fair enough.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.610
It takes you, I'd say about 40 or so minutes

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:42.730
to find your way back down around through the jungle

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:44.270
to get them, so for a short time--

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:45.103
TRAVIS: No, we've just left without them.

01:15:45.103 --> 01:15:48.134
MATT: -- Yasha and Beau are gone.

01:15:48.134 --> 01:15:49.490
So they're gone.

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:52.070
Like, they haven't-- you watch them vanish above

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:53.540
and peer over the edge,

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.880
so you do see that they're okay.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.870
Like, you see them for a moment

01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:58.660
and then they disappear for a while.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.600
LAURA: I can't send them any messages.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.070
SAM: I can send them a message.
LAURA: Do you think they went to--

01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:05.305
you want to send them something,

01:16:05.305 --> 01:16:07.563
see if they went to the village or something?
SAM: Sure, I'll hold up a little wire

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.755
and point to the direction--
LIAM: Are they within 120 feet?

01:16:09.755 --> 01:16:10.929
SAM: -- I think they're in.

01:16:10.929 --> 01:16:12.090
MATT: They would be as they start

01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:14.940
to find a way to climb down, yeah.

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.130
SAM: Yasha, you coming down?

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:17.765
You can reply to this message.

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:20.600
ASHLEY: Uh, yes, hello.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.100
Message received.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.210
(laughter)

01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:30.856
(stilted) We are on our <i>way</i> down to you ... all.

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:35.813
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.
(laughter)

01:16:35.813 --> 01:16:36.846
TRAVIS: Sit down.

01:16:36.846 --> 01:16:39.821
LIAM: Guys, it's partly cloudy with precipitation...

01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:42.015
ASHLEY: Charisma is my lowest stat.

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:45.348
(laughter)

01:16:46.923 --> 01:16:48.250
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:51.080
MATT: Eventually, as you guys are resting from the chaos

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.440
of what transpired, a short time later,

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.210
Beauregard and Yasha do join up with the rest of the group.

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.130
You guys take a short rest on the beach or--?

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:02.590
LAURA: I mean, we probably should.
SAM: Yeah, I mean,

01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:05.162
we can't teleport back to the village, right?

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:06.035
LAURA: I mean, we can.

01:17:06.035 --> 01:17:08.210
MATT: (as Vilya) "I can now that we have trees around."

01:17:08.210 --> 01:17:10.267
SAM: Maybe we should do that and then...

01:17:10.267 --> 01:17:11.990
(groans) what if it's chaos?

01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:14.140
Should we rest now?
LIAM: Or it's covered in magma.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.740
LAURA: There's nothing I can do.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.840
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, we could go and perhaps

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.500
arrive at the outskirts of the village

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.410
just in case everyone's killing each other,

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:25.168
and if it looks normal, then maybe we could go in?

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.390
MATT: "I know a tree that can get us there, yeah."

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:31.130
SAM: Let's go first and then rest when we get there.

01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:32.465
LAURA: I'm trying to make eye contact with Beau

01:17:32.465 --> 01:17:34.048
to see if she just had sex.

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:39.165
MARISHA: It's probably hard to tell if I have or not.

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.101
LAURA: Okay.

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.860
MATT: At this point, Vilya has gone to the similar tree

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.410
that you guys have utilized previously

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:51.630
on the side of the village, a side of the beach.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:52.780
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)
MATT: And you watch

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.780
as she places her hand across the side of its trunk,

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.540
takes the staff and the similar zipping motion,

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:05.100
pulls it down and as it does you watch as the doorway opens.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.880
From the other side, you can see the dense jungle interior

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.520
of the surrounding space of the village of Vo.

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.731
You do catch that the mist is gone.

01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:18.231
TRAVIS: Oh!

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.470
SAM: And the feeling of being watched?

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:22.712
MATT: No longer there.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.770
LAURA: We should go.
TALIESIN: Yep, go now.

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:27.340
MATT: "Yes, we should."

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:29.590
As you all come through and emerge from the other side,

01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:31.550
it closes behind you.

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:35.450
And you can just hear the distant sound of voices.

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:38.790
You're maybe about 30 or so feet from the perimeter

01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:40.815
of the village of Vo.

01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:42.420
MARISHA: Distant sound of voices?

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.160
Do they sound, like, panicked?

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.440
SAM: Crying?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.689
MATT: They are heightened, but you don't hear panic.

01:18:48.689 --> 01:18:49.522
TRAVIS: Hey.

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.440
MATT: It's just occasionally a loud voice.

01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:58.995
Caduceus, because of your-- actually, you and Beauregard...

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.120
you, Beauregard, and Caleb all have pretty high perceptions.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.255
The conversation seems to be people

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.905
having an argument.

01:19:12.635 --> 01:19:14.460
What do you guys do?

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.610
MARISHA: Can we get close enough to them,

01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:17.950
but stay out of sight?

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.040
LAURA: Yeah, because we do need to rest.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:20.900
MARISHA: I don't want to be seen.

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.010
TRAVIS: Could we also ask Vilya:

01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:25.050
First person that pops into your mind,

01:19:25.050 --> 01:19:27.698
who are we really trying to make contact with here?

01:19:27.698 --> 01:19:29.198
I'm sure there's someone.

01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:33.110
MATT: "All of my experiences have been with people

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:37.230
"pretty much clouded with the same magic.

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:38.450
"There have been a few people that have arrived

01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:41.078
"that seemed a bit dubious."

01:19:41.078 --> 01:19:42.744
LIAM: Yeah, these are people who
are remembering who they are

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:43.943
for the first time in years.
TRAVIS: Right.

01:19:43.943 --> 01:19:46.043
There's not one person in particular, though,

01:19:46.043 --> 01:19:48.990
that you <i>have</i> to make contact with?

01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:50.715
Just checking.

01:19:50.715 --> 01:19:52.450
MATT: "I don't have to."

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:53.830
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: "But if you're going

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:58.440
"to do this event, we have to figure out some way

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.610
"to functionally make this village

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:05.190
"and its people work together,

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:06.490
"lest we leave it to their devices,

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:09.060
"but I would like to at least help

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.158
"quell whatever confusion there is out there.

01:20:11.158 --> 01:20:15.920
"I mean, suddenly, they had all of these memories,

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.753
"flood back to them,

01:20:16.753 --> 01:20:18.780
"an experience that I've had on my own,

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.200
"thankfully in the presence of people

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.630
"that had a feeling of what was going on.

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:25.180
"I can't imagine what they're going through right now."

01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:29.340
LAURA: Do you want to go in without us and and talk to them?

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.030
Maybe as outsiders we won't be quite as welcomed.

01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:33.490
SAM: We should protect her, though.

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:35.130
What if they riot or blame her?

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.750
She was the leader.

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.660
LAURA: Oh, that's a good call.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:39.776
MATT: "Maybe.

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:42.950
"Stay best you can out of sight

01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:44.960
"and I'll go ahead and inquire then."

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.980
LAURA: Okay.

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.402
MATT: "All right."

01:20:47.402 --> 01:20:50.970
She fixes her posture, holds the staff,

01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:53.820
and begins to go into a powered walk

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.502
towards the village perimeter.

01:20:56.502 --> 01:20:58.940
SAM: I'm going to go with her invisible.

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:02.257
MATT: Okay. So you turn invisible and follow behind.

01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:05.040
As you get closer, you begin to make out

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.700
more of the words of the argument.

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:10.120
And it appears to be an argument

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.544
between individuals that are

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:18.615
arguing that the reason they came here

01:21:18.615 --> 01:21:22.050
is nonsensical.

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:23.320
All the work they were supposed to do--

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.200
"It's been 10 years.

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.260
"Our mission's done. We have no job to go back to.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.910
"What are we supposed to do now?"

01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:29.743
The other person's like, "Well,

01:21:29.743 --> 01:21:31.677
"maybe it's a fresh start, you know. We can go anywhere."

01:21:31.677 --> 01:21:33.780
It's like, "I don't want to go anywhere!"

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:36.080
And as you step into that space there,

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:40.812
you can see, one of the figures is Lukash,

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.547
who is currently

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.610
yelling at one of the other villagers

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:47.550
that you haven't met before, and is like,

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:49.453
"It's just,

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:54.530
"you work so hard to build a career and a reputation,

01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:58.920
"and one wayward journey just tears it away from you.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.240
"This is ridiculous!"

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.082
And he kicks over one of the other

01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:08.200
handmade chairs that sits on one of the outside

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.370
social spaces in amongst the village.

01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:11.580
And now as you begin to look around,

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.900
you can see there are other people

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.380
are in the process of like, having hushed conversations

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.390
and gathering their things.

01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:20.280
A lot of the village is very much in an energy of moving

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.220
or getting away.

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:22.510
They're in that panic state of,

01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:23.870
I'm not supposed to be here.

01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:25.350
I've been here how long?

01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:28.150
And you can see there's a lot of estranged, weird looks.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.270
You do see a couple of people that you saw families before.

01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:35.210
People that, like, had children,

01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:37.460
who are now in the process of having a really

01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:40.233
awkward conversation.

01:22:40.233 --> 01:22:42.290
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:45.710
MATT: Things are a bit weird right now in the village of Vo.

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.078
Vilya goes up to the Lukash and goes,

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.270
"Lukash!"

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:55.445
He turns to her.

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:58.070
"Deramid, what's your name?"

01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:59.620
SAM: Deramid?
MARISHA: Deramid.

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.462
TRAVIS: Deramid.
ASHLEY: Deramid.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.840
MATT: "Vilya."

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.957
(as Deramid) "All right, Vilya, great.

01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:08.860
"What happened?"

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.830
Then she begins to explain.

01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:12.860
"Well, it seems that

01:23:13.770 --> 01:23:15.990
"Vokodo had been doing this to us for some time.

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:20.120
"And me, along with the newcomers that you met

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.560
"a few nights back, managed to stop him."

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.023
He's like, "Wow, that's great news.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.440
"I'm just trying to figure out whether or not

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.310
"ignorance was bliss,

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:34.890
"or if I really wanted this to truth thrust upon me."

01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:38.460
And he goes, "No, no, I did.

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:40.870
"It would be ridiculous to keep living an absolute lie.

01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:43.812
"Thank you. I'm just really frustrated right now.

01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:47.680
"How the hell are we going to get off this place?"

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.290
And Vilya begins to speak.

01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:54.540
"Well, we did happen to find some ships

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:57.162
"that were hidden off to the side."

01:23:57.162 --> 01:24:00.150
He goes, "Oh, good, good.

01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:01.867
"Hopefully they have ours.

01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:05.390
"Where are your friends? Did they survive?"

01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:06.960
(as Vilya) "They're on their way.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.920
"They're on their way.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.810
"They'll be here shortly.

01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:11.900
"I managed to get here first just
to check in with the rest of you."

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.866
He goes, "Very well.

01:24:14.913 --> 01:24:16.870
"I would keep an eye out.

01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:19.240
"I don't know if everyone's trustworthy here

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.652
"at the time being.

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.247
"There's already been some strange goings on.

01:24:25.247 --> 01:24:27.380
"I'm going to gather what remains of my men.

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.940
"Hopefully, we find the ship and get the hell back

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.281
"to Port Zoon."

01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:34.992
And he steps away, with a frustrated huff.

01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:37.790
TRAVIS: Port Zoon?
MATT: Port Zoon.

01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:42.781
TALIESIN: I think it's--

01:24:42.781 --> 01:24:46.210
ASHLEY: (gasps) The pocket watch.
SAM: Hm?

01:24:46.210 --> 01:24:47.517
TALIESIN: Could be.
LAURA: What?

01:24:47.517 --> 01:24:48.350
SAM: Hm?

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.570
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Never mind.

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:53.000
Maybe.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.450
TALIESIN: I think it's time to make ourselves known.

01:24:56.650 --> 01:24:58.275
MATT: So as you're following,

01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:02.265
about 10 minutes or so as

01:25:02.265 --> 01:25:05.093
Vilya begins to speak to a few other
people that she interacts with.

01:25:05.093 --> 01:25:06.920
Many people will come to her and be like,

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.590
"What's happening?

01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:09.423
"What's real?

01:25:09.423 --> 01:25:10.530
"I'm trying to--" They're all trying

01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:14.750
to figure out ways to consolidate their previous lives

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:19.180
and their "real", not real lives.

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.970
And there's just an air of anxiety

01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:26.053
and brewing chaos, throughout the entire village.

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.570
You can see there are now groups of people

01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:31.560
that are taking all their things and packing them up

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.070
and are ready to just shove off, in whatever direction.

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:36.160
You can see some individuals

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.150
that are keeping together quietly

01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:41.690
and just keeping a weird eye on everyone else,

01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:43.690
as they're getting ready to leave.

01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:46.157
It's already segmenting into factions.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.650
You do see as Vilya goes and says--

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:53.390
and notices towards Ashelyn,

01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:57.263
who-- or she says, "Jaina,"

01:25:57.263 --> 01:25:59.663
and Jaina goes, "Uh, Ashelyn."

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:01.953
(as Vilya) "Ashelyn."

01:26:01.953 --> 01:26:04.680
And you see the the wood elf werebear

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.740
woman who led you guys here,

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.007
who's in the process of throwing some things into a sack.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.673
(as Ashelyn) "Right, right.

01:26:12.673 --> 01:26:14.312
"So, this has been very weird.

01:26:16.706 --> 01:26:18.940
"Do you know how to get off this rock, huh?

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.920
Vilya goes, "I do have some ways
of doing so. That is correct.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:26.250
"I can't now, but perhaps in the days to come."

01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:27.260
(as Ashelyn) "Oh great, great.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.290
"Everyone hear that?

01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:34.290
"Viridian here is our key to getting out of here."

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:37.928
And you watch as the voices begin to mutter and whisper.

01:26:37.928 --> 01:26:40.000
People begin to turn and look and Vilya

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.560
holds the staff a little closer to her chest

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.030
and takes a couple steps back and goes,

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:47.300
"Right, in time, depending on the destination

01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:51.110
"and my experience, I can get us away

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:54.373
"from here in waves and I'm willing to do so.

01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:59.740
"I just need everyone to be calm and civil about this."

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.170
There's a pause and some folks

01:27:01.170 --> 01:27:03.810
step a little closer and some folks (scoff)

01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:05.660
and go back to their work.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.718
It's a very different village

01:27:06.718 --> 01:27:08.110
from where you left it.
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:10.860
MATT: So you're following this.

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:12.500
Are you doing anything or are you just watching?

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.590
SAM: I'm just watching right now and but, you know,

01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:16.970
as they step closer, I just--

01:27:18.245 --> 01:27:21.480
I'm ready to defend if I need to, but seems okay.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.646
MATT: Okay.

01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:26.880
You see as an older woman,

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.240
actually the one who was helping fix the food

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.446
for the the communal event

01:27:32.446 --> 01:27:34.230
that you all shared it over dinner.

01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:37.547
Anola, she introduced herself as, steps forward and goes,

01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:41.628
"So Viridian,

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.335
"I've been here a long time.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.760
"I've spent more time here than I have at home.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.485
"Do we all <i>have</i> to go?"

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:56.625
And Vilya goes, "I don't imagine you have to.

01:27:58.170 --> 01:27:59.960
"I mean, anyone who wishes to stay, they can.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.078
"We had a sustainable life.

01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.840
"I guess we have to figure out who needs to go

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.880
"and who wants to stay."

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.230
You see a few heads nod.

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.718
And the woman goes,

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.280
"Well then, I'll begin asking around, then.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.540
"I want to be helpful in that way.

01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.545
"If that's all right."

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:21.945
(as Vilya) "Of course, Anola."

01:28:21.945 --> 01:28:25.260
And she goes, "Wenthal,

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.660
"you can call me Wenthal.

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.290
"You know?

01:28:29.290 --> 01:28:30.273
"No.

01:28:31.450 --> 01:28:32.741
"Call me Anola.

01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:35.483
"Yes."

01:28:35.483 --> 01:28:37.650
And she turns around and heads off

01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:39.320
and you begin to see another side.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.940
The tension splits a little bit

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:44.210
and now that there's been this discussion of--

01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:45.830
which seems to be an element of

01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:48.400
which life was better for some people--

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.610
that faction division begins to be noticeable.

01:28:51.610 --> 01:28:54.183
There's no immediate tension there.

01:28:54.183 --> 01:28:56.110
It's just a lot of people finding

01:28:56.110 --> 01:28:58.647
possibly previous individuals they knew,

01:28:59.550 --> 01:29:02.520
and figure out what this new dynamic is.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.500
But nobody seems to be outwardly aggressive towards

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.140
Vilya at the moment.

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:10.147
Vilya turns around after seeing things

01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.900
manageable on its own for a moment,

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:15.710
turns around and heads back to meet up

01:29:15.710 --> 01:29:17.780
with The Mighty Nein once more.

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.405
You follow?
SAM: Yes, yes.

01:29:19.405 --> 01:29:21.880
I'm going to explain to everybody what happened.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:24.188
MATT: Vilya comes and explains as well.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.308
"So it's a bit strange."

01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:33.350
SAM: Yeah, I mean, two things struck me as being just--

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:34.890
First of all, you know,

01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:36.730
many people are still looking towards you

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:39.720
for some sort of leadership or answers.

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.830
I don't know if that's a role that you want,

01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:46.040
but perhaps it would be wise to at least,

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.190
calm some of the tensions

01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:50.280
if we were to call some sort of meeting

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.370
or conference or something,

01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:56.060
just so everyone can sort of air their grievances

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.260
and check in with each other all together

01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.820
and form a group plan.

01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:04.690
MATT: "I feel responsible for a lot of this,

01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:07.450
"or at least helping as much as I can.

01:30:07.450 --> 01:30:09.540
"It will take me a number of days

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:13.090
"to vacate the majority of this village,

01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:15.650
"but let's see how many wish to stay, how many wish to go.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.680
"I don't wish to stay.

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.980
"While I have enjoyed elements of my time here,

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:26.900
"there are more important people I wish to see."

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.950
LAURA: Your family?

01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.570
MATT: "In time."
TRAVIS: You said you saw Lukash.

01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:32.410
Did you see...

01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:36.820
Deramid?

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.430
Did you see Terra?

01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:40.340
MATT: "Not yet, no."

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:43.050
TRAVIS: It seems that if they went to you

01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:45.340
and to Deramid and Terra then,

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.080
shouldn't we locate her?

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.380
MATT: "Let's go try."

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:52.980
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.510
Should we--
SAM: Fan out or--?

01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:58.170
LAURA: Keep an eye on your belongings everyone.

01:30:58.170 --> 01:30:59.540
TRAVIS: Oh, yes.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.480
If we check our inventory for the things that went missing,

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.630
are they still missing?

01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:06.280
MATT: I would say for the most part,

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:07.860
because you guys spent quite a few rounds

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:11.057
in the midst of being burned horribly by the water.

01:31:11.057 --> 01:31:12.177
Did not scare you off.

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.133
I'd say everything except for...

01:31:17.158 --> 01:31:20.008
there was a hammer that was
lost at one point, right?

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.877
Yeah, can't find your hammer.

01:31:23.877 --> 01:31:25.075
Sorry, man.

01:31:25.075 --> 01:31:27.412
LAURA: Oh, but my hair oil, it's back!

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.250
SAM: Like, all that stuff was with Vokodo?

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.220
LAURA: How did he get it?
SAM: Or was it just on us?

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.230
MATT: It was all with Vokodo, weirdly.

01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:38.190
SAM: Oh, wow.
LAURA: That's strange, how?

01:31:39.416 --> 01:31:41.750
MATT: It's very strange.
TRAVIS: How do you take that feat?

01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:45.430
Inventory Fog Suck!

01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:48.700
LAURA: During the time that Yasha and Beau were up top,

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.670
and we were just chilling or during that time

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:52.510
when Vilya was in the village,

01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:53.990
can we look through some of the stuff

01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:55.848
that we found?

01:31:55.848 --> 01:31:56.956
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to. Sure.

01:31:56.956 --> 01:32:00.190
LAURA: Maybe Identify some of the stuff that we found?

01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:01.370
LIAM: Yeah.

01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:02.810
What do you got?

01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:04.320
SAM: I mean, so much stuff.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.150
LAURA: There were four magical items

01:32:06.150 --> 01:32:07.370
that we probably didn't get to look at.

01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:08.380
MARISHA: I have them.

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.530
Boats.

01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:10.363
Nope!

01:32:10.363 --> 01:32:13.280
<i>Coat</i>, boots, case, and staff.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.470
TRAVIS: Maybe just the four items and not all the other--

01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:17.303
LAURA: Yeah, no, no, no,

01:32:17.303 --> 01:32:19.830
we you don't want to pull it
out and let everyone see it.

01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:22.750
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's mostly just--
LIAM: Just magical.

01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:24.800
LAURA: And then we're going to put it back in our bags

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.193
and hide the shit.
MATT: Yeah.

01:32:26.193 --> 01:32:27.368
It would take--

01:32:29.552 --> 01:32:30.385
it would take a while

01:32:30.385 --> 01:32:32.440
for you to catalog everything that you took.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.550
Because you took a lot.

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:37.410
You've never had this much money at your disposal.

01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:38.701
SAM: Whoa!

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:40.960
MATT: So there's that.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.143
SAM: But we should probably do a little category--

01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:46.693
categorizing

01:32:46.693 --> 01:32:49.220
in case we want to dole out some of it to these people

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:52.800
before they go about their way.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.600
MATT: Vilya says, "I can go ahead and speak

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.310
"to our previous village elders

01:32:56.310 --> 01:33:00.260
"and other emerging figures of interest

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.000
"and talk about gathering everyone

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.050
"to discuss what's to be done tonight."

01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:06.420
SAM: That would be good.

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.590
Do you need help doing that?

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:09.660
Do you feel safe?

01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.820
MATT: "I feel safe.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.650
"If it gets bad, I have my means

01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:16.970
"of getting out of a hairy situation."

01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:19.000
MARISHA: Why don't we find a little hovel?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.490
LAURA: Yeah, one of the houses that's, like,

01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:24.460
abandoned or anything, that we can huddle up in.

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.160
MARISHA: Take a rest, count some money.

01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:30.040
LAURA: Barricade the door.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.380
MATT: "All right.

01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.388
"Shall we then?"
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:33:34.388 --> 01:33:36.200
MATT: All right, you head back and enter the village

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.900
and you see exactly what was seen by Veth

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.075
and Vilya upon their arrival.

01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:46.560
A short time into keeping an eye out,

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.950
two things catch your eye.

01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:52.110
There is a small group of three people

01:33:52.110 --> 01:33:54.210
that you've never seen before,

01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:56.050
that are on the south side of the village,

01:33:56.050 --> 01:33:58.625
that all look very confused,

01:33:58.625 --> 01:34:01.083
with large bundles

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:03.855
and they're all going--

01:34:03.855 --> 01:34:05.880
ASHLEY: Oh no.
(laughter)

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:08.220
LAURA: They're arriving!
SAM: Early birds!

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.650
LIAM: Where's Con registration?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:12.787
MARISHA: Wednesday arrival.
LIAM: Where do I get my badge and lanyard?

01:34:12.787 --> 01:34:15.060
MATT: You see a scrawny male dwarf,

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.600
with a brown scraggly beard,

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:22.600
a mostly bald head, not by shaved, but by balding pattern,

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:25.220
who's just wearing

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:29.470
very weathered travel clothes
and has two cases at his sides,

01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:30.828
and he's just like,

01:34:31.969 --> 01:34:33.799
"Hello?!"

01:34:33.799 --> 01:34:34.865
LAURA: Ah, shit.

01:34:34.865 --> 01:34:38.240
MATT: You see a female human
with shoulder length blonde hair,

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:42.620
who is very well dressed, who is impatiently standing

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:46.430
and looking around, arms crossed.

01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:50.310
And you do see a male goliath, who is thick,

01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:52.540
this thick barrel-like goliath,

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.340
shorter than you'd expect, but definitely wide with muscle

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.447
and just general rotundness,

01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:01.240
who's right next to the female human

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:04.080
and keeping an eye on her other side

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.820
and they stick out like sore thumbs.

01:35:07.398 --> 01:35:10.210
TALIESIN: The D&amp;D cast of Clue.
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:12.300
SAM: We should go over and just say--

01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.280
what-- say something.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.258
LAURA: I'm going to put on one of
my stupid green cloaks that I made.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.580
Here, put this on.

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.740
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:22.007
Hey, how about this:

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.180
The previous con hasn't finished,

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.260
hasn't cleared out yet,

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.000
so we'll just you know?
TRAVIS: The panel?

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.490
The previous panel?

01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:33.090
SAM: So just hang tight.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:36.630
Okay, we walk over to look.
TRAVIS: No saving seats.

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:38.870
SAM: What do you say? Traveler be with you?

01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:39.703
Pack your bags?

01:35:39.703 --> 01:35:42.165
Like, what's what's the thing the Traveler--

01:35:42.165 --> 01:35:44.432
followers of the Traveler say?
LAURA: I don't know.

01:35:46.335 --> 01:35:47.377
LAURA: Eat a bag of dicks.

01:35:47.377 --> 01:35:48.893
I don't fucking know.
SAM: Eat a bag of dicks.

01:35:48.893 --> 01:35:50.501
TRAVIS: This is important, branding's very important.

01:35:50.501 --> 01:35:52.093
LAURA: You're right. We need to come up with this.

01:35:52.093 --> 01:35:53.363
SAM: Traveler-- tra--

01:35:53.363 --> 01:35:55.890
LIAM: Whatever you say, is what
followers of the Travelers say.

01:35:55.890 --> 01:35:57.880
LAURA: Blessings be upon you, my child.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:00.398
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa, that's very official.

01:36:00.398 --> 01:36:01.231
Where's the fun?

01:36:03.148 --> 01:36:04.597
TALIESIN: I've never heard the Traveler say that, either.

01:36:04.597 --> 01:36:06.680
LIAM: "It's pretty cool."

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.103
LAURA: Traveler welcomes-- I don't--

01:36:08.103 --> 01:36:09.715
SAM: "The Traveler welcomes you"?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

01:36:09.715 --> 01:36:12.790
We'll just figure it out, come on, let's go.

01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:13.760
SAM: Keep moving.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.260
MATT: So, cloaks adorned.
LAURA: Yes.

01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:18.770
MATT: You approach and even before you get

01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:20.580
to vocalize anything, you can see the dwarf

01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:23.160
looks over and sees cloaks and goes, "Ah!"

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.235
His face brightens.

01:36:26.410 --> 01:36:28.999
LAURA: Blessings be upon you, my children.

01:36:28.999 --> 01:36:32.452
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:36:32.452 --> 01:36:34.510
LIAM: (whispering) What is she doing?

01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:36.268
MATT: "All right, um..."

01:36:37.924 --> 01:36:40.830
LAURA: Eat a bag of dicks! Welcome to Traveler Con!

01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:43.680
MATT: "All right, so we're at the right place! Okay, okay.

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.060
"It's been a long journey.

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:50.230
"Got here a little early, earlier than we expected."

01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:51.063
LAURA: Yes, you did.

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.370
MATT: "Pleased to meet you.

01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:55.480
"My name is Kellbast.

01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.660
"What's your name?"

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.600
SAM: Is that the goliath or the dwarf?
MATT: No, it's the dwarf.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.310
LAURA: Kellbast.
SAM: Kalabash.

01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:01.643
MATT: Kellbast.
LIAM: Cowbell.

01:37:01.643 --> 01:37:03.102
LAURA: Kellbast.

01:37:03.102 --> 01:37:04.090
MARISHA: Kellbast.

01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:06.990
LAURA: Well, Kellbast, I'm Jester.
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you."

01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:09.040
LAURA: High Priestess of the Traveler.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.560
MATT: "Maker of fine furniture."

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.220
LAURA: Wonderful.

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.610
SAM: Hi, I'm Veth.

01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:15.690
I am--
LAURA: Second high priestess.

01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:18.799
SAM: -- second apprentice to the high priest...

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:19.632
...ess.

01:37:19.632 --> 01:37:20.631
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you."

01:37:20.631 --> 01:37:23.315
"Kellbast, maker of fine furniture.

01:37:23.315 --> 01:37:24.800
"I was traveling along the ship here

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.130
"before we got dropped off with my other travel mates here."

01:37:27.130 --> 01:37:28.880
He points to the female who's like--

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.450
"This is Celia and her buddy Trudo."

01:37:34.450 --> 01:37:37.140
TRAVIS: Trudo? (laughs)
(laughter)

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:39.460
MATT: (as Celia) "Actually, he's my bodyguard."

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:41.460
LAURA: Is he also a follower of the Traveler?

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.679
MATT: "For the purposes of this, sure."

01:37:44.679 --> 01:37:46.205
LAURA: Great.

01:37:46.205 --> 01:37:49.168
SAM: Hey, where'd you park your boat?

01:37:49.168 --> 01:37:52.470
Is it out in the open where people can see it?

01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:55.090
MATT: "No, we were dropped off."
SAM: Okay, good.

01:37:55.090 --> 01:37:57.998
MATT: "We were told there was going to
be some sort of means of return,

01:37:57.998 --> 01:37:59.197
"when the convention was done."

01:37:59.197 --> 01:38:01.131
LAURA: Sure! Yeah.
SAM: Ooh! Okay.

01:38:01.131 --> 01:38:05.128
LAURA: Of course. Does the Traveler ever lie?

01:38:05.128 --> 01:38:06.910
He does not.

01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:08.001
Welcome.

01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:09.842
My child.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.910
MATT: "Well, thank you."

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:16.110
LAURA: How long have you been a follower of the Traveler?

01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:17.135
MATT: "Myself?

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:20.330
"About two and a half years.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.910
"Could you please tell us where arrangements we made

01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:27.690
"for us to be staying, sleeping comfortably?"

01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:29.250
SAM: Because of your early arrival,

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:32.530
your quarters aren't quite ready yet. But--

01:38:32.530 --> 01:38:34.272
MATT: You hear a distant fistfight breaking out

01:38:34.272 --> 01:38:35.656
on the north side of the village.

01:38:35.656 --> 01:38:36.639
(laughter)

01:38:36.639 --> 01:38:39.630
SAM: There was a square dancing convention

01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:40.680
here before.
LAURA: Yes.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.990
It got, you know,

01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:43.530
it got a little violent.
TRAVIS: Isn't there also

01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:45.740
the purging loop you mentioned,

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:48.330
that there's, like, a spiritual cleansing,

01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:50.550
that you have to partake in before you're ready?

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:53.230
LAURA: Yes.
TRAVIS: Takes a bit.

01:38:53.230 --> 01:38:55.680
LAURA: Yes, you have to cleanse yourself

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.990
before you can enter the village

01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:00.660
and find your accommodations.

01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:03.110
MATT: "Well, a bath will be very, very appreciated."

01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:05.960
LAURA: Yes, so make your way back through the woods

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.660
to the beach where you landed.

01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:13.080
Walk into the ocean and you know, get wet,

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.437
and then come on back.
TRAVIS: Head to toe.

01:39:15.437 --> 01:39:17.650
LAURA: And then--
MATT: "In the ocean, are you serious?"

01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:20.067
LAURA: I'm sorry. Are you too good for the Traveler?

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:25.117
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:39:25.117 --> 01:39:26.133
LAURA: Oh no.

01:39:29.657 --> 01:39:31.738
Yeah, yeah this is going to be good.

01:39:31.738 --> 01:39:34.090
11.
MATT: 11.

01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:35.165
She goes,

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:40.639
"I'll bathe.

01:39:41.698 --> 01:39:43.473
"When I find the proper water."

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:46.200
"Come," and she looks back.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.053
"Trudo, we'll find arrangements."

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.050
LAURA: Have a good time.

01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:53.250
I hate her.

01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:57.266
SAM: Yeah, I mean, wow, this is going to be hard. (laughs)

01:39:57.266 --> 01:39:59.533
LAURA: I mean, am I supposed to, like, welcome everyone?!

01:39:59.533 --> 01:40:01.208
SAM: I think so. You're the organizer.

01:40:01.208 --> 01:40:03.658
I think you're supposed to be, you know, welcoming.

01:40:03.658 --> 01:40:04.826
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

01:40:04.826 --> 01:40:06.768
Well, I got to put up, like, decorations,

01:40:06.768 --> 01:40:08.766
I got to get up the banners and stuff.
SAM: I know, I know.

01:40:08.766 --> 01:40:09.720
MATT: (as Kellbast) "Do y'all need help with that?

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.800
"I'd be happy to help.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.995
"I mean, I got nothing else doing here

01:40:11.995 --> 01:40:13.920
"and I'm pretty handy with my hands.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.470
"By the way, I'm glad you said something.

01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:18.550
"She's been an interesting traveling..."

01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:20.570
LAURA: Have you been-- were you on the boat with her?

01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:21.780
MATT: "Yeah."

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.873
LAURA: How is she a follower of the Traveler?

01:40:23.873 --> 01:40:25.456
MATT: "I don't know."
LAURA: Ugh!

01:40:25.456 --> 01:40:27.490
When did he come visit you?

01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:31.280
MATT: "Oh, I've only been praying to him
for about six, seven months myself."

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.050
LAURA: Oh, really?
MATT: "Yeah."

01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:35.777
LAURA: Well, how did you meet?

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.920
MATT: "Well, you see it--"
SAM: Speed dating.

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.010
MATT: "It all began when I was
trying to restart my business,

01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:45.363
"outside of Feolinn,

01:40:45.363 --> 01:40:47.750
"and I mainly specialize in plum tree wood

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:51.100
"is my main form of carving material.

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.470
"And as I opened my first shop,

01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:55.380
"there immediately began to be this sort of--

01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:58.030
"I don't know how else to put it, like, I don't know,

01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:00.770
"a racketeering element going on

01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:03.830
"with other competitive carpentry locations

01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:05.227
"and shops within.

01:41:05.227 --> 01:41:07.820
"And they were trying to push me
out, and they nearly did, too,

01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:10.130
"and I just got so gosh darn angry one night

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:12.410
"and I went ahead and just asked for help.

01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:13.970
"And this one customer comes on in

01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:15.290
"and buys one of my finer pieces,

01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:17.460
"this fine cloaked gentlemen in green

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:20.460
"and starts talking to me and senses my frustration

01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:21.940
"and says, you know, there's ways to get back

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:24.130
"at those who are trying to tear you down.

01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:26.450
"I mean, I wouldn't want vengeance,

01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:29.230
"it's not my kind of way, but a little playful prankery

01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:32.850
"isn't too bad and you know what? He helped me."

01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:33.850
LAURA: That's right.

01:41:33.850 --> 01:41:37.830
The Traveler comes to us when we most need him.

01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:41.700
MATT: "So it's been him helping me kind of, you know,

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.045
"how do they say it in the streets?

01:41:44.045 --> 01:41:47.007
"Screw with my competition a little."

01:41:47.007 --> 01:41:48.450
SAM: Is that a carpentry joke?

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:49.594
MATT: "Yeah, yeah."
SAM: It's good.

01:41:49.594 --> 01:41:52.760
(laughter)

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.450
MATT: "So, yeah.

01:41:54.450 --> 01:41:55.510
"So far he's been so kind.

01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:57.230
"I haven't been really much of a praying sort,

01:41:57.230 --> 01:41:58.280
"but I've been trying real hard

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.640
"and I always felt kind of on my own.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.380
"But when he told me that there was going to be a gathering,

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:04.370
"I knew there were more out there

01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:06.370
"and I'm just excited to meet all of them.

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:08.770
"And I'm excited to meet both of you."

01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:11.010
LAURA: That's wonderful.
SAM: You're our kind of people.

01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:12.020
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yep.

01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.520
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Well, that's wonderful.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.046
If you do want to help,

01:42:16.046 --> 01:42:18.220
I'm sure we can find something for you to do.

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.180
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: "I can help you build a better sign."

01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:23.282
LAURA: Oh, because, yeah, is ours-- how's it doing up there?

01:42:23.282 --> 01:42:27.387
MATT: "Uh. (uncertain noises) I can make a better sign."

01:42:27.387 --> 01:42:29.710
LAURA: Okay. I will rely on you to do that.

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:30.990
MATT: "All right."
SAM: No, no, no.

01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:33.370
The <i>Traveler</i> will rely on you to do that.

01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:36.320
LAURA: Him, too, yeah.
MATT: "Ha ha. Yeah, he will."

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.610
LAURA: I speak for him right now because, you know,

01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:40.870
we organized all this together.

01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:42.790
MATT: "You organized all this?"
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:44.890
LAURA: You know, we're, like, super tight.

01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:46.640
MATT: "You said you were the high priestess, so."

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.400
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.
MATT: "Well, I'm at your disposal."

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.969
He bows his head a little bit and is like,

01:42:50.969 --> 01:42:54.190
"I'll go gather materials for a sign."

01:42:54.190 --> 01:42:55.650
LAURA: Be careful, there's things in the woods.

01:42:55.650 --> 01:42:58.180
Just, you know, head to the beach and do the stuff there.

01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.480
MATT: "I'll get it from inside the village."

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.720
LAURA: Okay, also be careful, guard your things,

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.831
I don't know what kind of people are here. Okay.

01:43:04.831 --> 01:43:05.664
MATT: "Okay."

01:43:05.664 --> 01:43:07.960
Grabs his things and hustles off with his,

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.780
you know, stocky dwarven legs.

01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:12.890
LAURA: Oh, he's so nice.
SAM: Sure, sure.

01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:14.930
LAURA: How terrible would it have
been if he'd have come here

01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:16.370
and lost his memory.

01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:17.203
That would have been so sad.

01:43:17.203 --> 01:43:19.780
SAM: Of course. Jester,

01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:20.613
we need to--

01:43:20.613 --> 01:43:23.790
I mean, you need to figure this out pretty quick

01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:26.310
for the people who are coming.
LAURA: I really thought we'd have more time.

01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:28.230
Because it's supposed to be, like, seven more days,

01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:29.330
I don't even have a watch

01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:31.880
and I don't know.
SAM: But also the people

01:43:33.069 --> 01:43:38.069
of the village of Vo are at a crucial crossroads right now.

01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:42.300
They, possibly more so than the people coming here

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.925
for Traveler Con, need guidance,

01:43:44.925 --> 01:43:48.108
need spiritual guidance.

01:43:48.108 --> 01:43:49.890
LAURA: So I should turn them all into followers?

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.754
Because I don't think he wants more.
SAM: I don't about that,

01:43:51.754 --> 01:43:55.300
but I'm just saying this is a probletunity for us.

01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:57.860
TRAVIS: A probletunity!

01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:59.350
Holy shit!

01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:01.845
LAURA: Explain.
TRAVIS: Make the shirt.

01:44:01.845 --> 01:44:03.248
MARISHA: Did you just make that up or is that some

01:44:03.248 --> 01:44:04.880
corporate room bullshit?
TRAVIS: Never heard of that.

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.077
SAM: You can...

01:44:07.077 --> 01:44:07.913
TALIESIN: Oh, my heart.

01:44:07.913 --> 01:44:09.170
SAM: You can make an event

01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:10.940
that not only welcomes these people

01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.930
who are coming from far and wide,

01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:15.410
but also provides clarity and guidance

01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:17.110
to the people here who need it most.

01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:19.370
Some of them who've said they want to stay

01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:20.660
and have a purpose.

01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.690
I'm just saying, if you play this right,

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:25.970
you could change a lot of people's lives for the better

01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:28.350
and not just by fucking with them

01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:30.320
and tricking them with the Traveler,

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.573
but doing something good for them.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.800
LIAM: And as a sidebar, you probably want to talk to him.

01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:46.070
Now that things have changed here on the island.

01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:47.760
LAURA: And let him know.

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:50.130
Yeah, well, I know. I need to-- I do--

01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:51.468
I need to talk to him.

01:44:51.468 --> 01:44:54.670
I need to let him know to not bring people here so early,

01:44:54.670 --> 01:44:55.660
what the fuck?

01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:58.430
And also, yes, maybe, you know,

01:44:58.430 --> 01:45:01.900
we can talk some of the followers of him

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.600
to stay here on the island, too,

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.030
and they can stay with the people

01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:08.120
that want to stay from the cult

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.410
and everybody can live happily.

01:45:10.410 --> 01:45:12.692
And then the Traveler, he won't have to go see

01:45:12.692 --> 01:45:14.622
a bunch of people. He can just

01:45:14.622 --> 01:45:16.680
have to worry about visiting one location

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.560
every once in a while.

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.810
That's way better.

01:45:18.810 --> 01:45:20.370
SAM: Sure, sure.

01:45:20.370 --> 01:45:23.235
LAURA: This is going to be good.
MATT: (as Orly) "Mm, Cap'n."

01:45:23.235 --> 01:45:24.410
SAM: Oh!
TRAVIS: Oh ho! (laughs)

01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:26.343
MARISHA: Shit, yeah!
MATT: You look over and

01:45:26.343 --> 01:45:27.643
you see approaching from another side

01:45:27.643 --> 01:45:28.710
of the southern part of the village--

01:45:28.710 --> 01:45:32.690
you see the crew of your previous, now sunken, ship

01:45:32.690 --> 01:45:37.690
approach, helmed by the fantastic Orly Skiffback.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.720
"So, based on what I'm

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:47.445
"seeing, you were successful, right?"

01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:51.720
TRAVIS: Yes, we succeeded.

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.832
Did Marius kill anyone yet?

01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:58.230
MATT: "Marius?"

01:45:58.230 --> 01:45:59.880
(as Marius) "Yes?"

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.132
(as Orly) "You done killed anyone?"

01:46:02.132 --> 01:46:04.015
(as Marius) "Oh, lord, no, what?

01:46:04.015 --> 01:46:05.610
"Oh, come on!"

01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:07.336
TRAVIS: Fair enough.
MARISHA: Useless.

01:46:07.336 --> 01:46:09.152
TRAVIS: We were successful.

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:13.223
Although the situation's changed just a tiny bit.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:17.250
All of these people now have no idea

01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:18.340
what they're going to do next.

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:22.228
So the conditions are a bit fluid at the moment.

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.780
MATT: "Is there a problem, Cap'n?"

01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:29.040
TRAVIS: It's not necessarily our concern,

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.950
but I would make you aware of a certain cove

01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:35.430
on the eastern part of the island.

01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:37.920
There are, and keep this to yourself,

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.410
a number of ships,

01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:41.830
hidden behind a very powerful waterfall.

01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:44.790
Maybe just, you could set up camp over there.

01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:46.650
We'll give you a direction and I'll point it out

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:48.300
on the map and say:

01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:51.120
Maybe wait over there for us.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.380
It's probably going to be our best bet off the island.

01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:55.930
MATT: At the mention of a cave of ships,

01:46:55.930 --> 01:47:00.680
you watch a vitality renewed flush through his face.

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.970
Orly is a pretty reserved individual

01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:06.220
when it comes to emotion and even approaching here,

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.970
you weren't aware at how low key he was,

01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:10.480
but the minute you say ships,

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:13.410
this cracking turtle grin draws across his face

01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:17.060
and the one visible eye turns into this excited

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:22.010
glance, he's like, "Well, it would be fine

01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:25.870
"to join you at sea once more, Cap'n."

01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:29.062
TRAVIS: That means quite a lot, Orly.

01:47:29.062 --> 01:47:32.240
We'll go on shopping run.

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.650
MATT: "Very well."

01:47:33.650 --> 01:47:35.680
LIAM: Might want to do that sooner than later.

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.588
Could be a free for all.

01:47:37.588 --> 01:47:38.638
MATT: "Don't you

01:47:38.638 --> 01:47:43.548
"m-m-mind yourself too much.

01:47:43.548 --> 01:47:45.281
"m-m-mind yourself too much.

01:47:45.281 --> 01:47:47.590
"We going to go and find these ships

01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:51.940
"and get them mighty ready."

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.990
TRAVIS: There was one that we wanted to--

01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:55.170
MARISHA: Eden's Horizon.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:57.305
SAM: Nein Heroez.
MARISHA: It's the best.

01:47:57.305 --> 01:47:59.450
TALIESIN: I'll also say that the waterfall

01:47:59.450 --> 01:48:01.180
is difficult to get around, but there is

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:03.480
a tiny cave.
LAURA: A small tunnel.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.470
TRAVIS: There's a hole now.

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:07.790
SAM: And maybe with your crew and expertise,

01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:12.425
you could figure out a way to
start building a way out of it.

01:48:12.425 --> 01:48:14.173
MATT: "We'll try."
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's true,

01:48:14.173 --> 01:48:15.093
there is no way.
LAURA: Yeah, you've got to figure out

01:48:15.093 --> 01:48:16.110
how to get the boats out.

01:48:16.110 --> 01:48:17.900
SAM: Well, I bet they could figure it out.

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:18.733
MATT: "We'll try."

01:48:18.733 --> 01:48:20.520
TALIESIN: A little Stone Shape, if it comes to it.

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.170
MARISHA: Seriously.
TALIESIN: A little Control Water shot'd do it.

01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:25.330
MARISHA: It will shoot your ass up, like, 20-- 100 feet

01:48:25.330 --> 01:48:26.370
in the air.
TRAVIS: 20?

01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:29.060
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: "Fair enough.

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:34.060
"So, avoid getting water up our ass. All right."

01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:35.400
MARISHA: Yep.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.650
MATT: "Well, (claps). Come along, crew!

01:48:39.650 --> 01:48:44.415
"Looks like we got ourselves a cove to locate."

01:48:44.415 --> 01:48:45.430
LAURA: Don't say it too loud, though.

01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:46.847
TRAVIS: Keep it to yourself.

01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:51.120
MATT: He folds the map and sets it aside.

01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:56.250
"See y'all soon," and they begin to head off

01:48:56.250 --> 01:48:58.970
in an Eastern direction, past the village

01:48:58.970 --> 01:49:00.290
TRAVIS: Marius is going to die before

01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:01.410
they get there.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:03.700
I'm assuming all of the the horrible monsters

01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:05.990
are still out there, as well as the vines

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:07.910
and the bugs and--
MARISHA: I hope he gets eaten by a--

01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:09.390
LAURA: We warn them all

01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:11.380
of all those things before they leave.

01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:13.588
TRAVIS: No, we don't.
LAURA: Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

01:49:13.588 --> 01:49:15.321
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:49:15.321 --> 01:49:17.035
LIAM: Tell them about the tunnel, probably,

01:49:17.035 --> 01:49:18.235
would be a good idea.

01:49:19.112 --> 01:49:20.403
Not go through.

01:49:20.403 --> 01:49:22.942
MARISHA: Have a first kill or be the first kill.

01:49:22.942 --> 01:49:24.010
LIAM: It was a miracle that Marius

01:49:24.010 --> 01:49:25.820
made it the docks that first day.

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.930
TRAVIS: That's right. (laughs)

01:49:27.930 --> 01:49:32.250
MATT: So, at this time, Vilya is off making arrangements

01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:33.083
for those that are here

01:49:33.083 --> 01:49:36.218
to have a communal conversation later in the day.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.140
In the meantime, the rest of the day is yours

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:41.670
to do what you see fit.

01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:43.170
LAURA: We need to hole up, find a place

01:49:43.170 --> 01:49:44.003
to lay down.
LIAM: Yeah, let's make

01:49:44.003 --> 01:49:45.220
a base of operations.

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.685
I'd like to throw the dome up inside of a tree house

01:49:48.685 --> 01:49:51.120
and take inventory, not of every treasure,

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.928
but figure out what it is that you two are lugging

01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:56.450
and rest.

01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:57.533
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:50:00.038 --> 01:50:03.860
MARISHA: Can we look around, see if
there's an empty hovel somewhere?

01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:06.050
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:07.860
TRAVIS: Terra's still out there.

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.970
MARISHA: Meh, cocked.
LIAM: Cocked.

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.050
MARISHA: Cocked.

01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:14.760
Okay, 18.

01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.668
No, sorry,

01:50:16.668 --> 01:50:18.510
17.
MATT: 17, okay.

01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:20.078
As you begin walking through,

01:50:20.078 --> 01:50:23.330
looking for the areas of the most activity,

01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:24.640
you look for a home that looks

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.920
like there's nothing going on

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.200
and is mostly empty for the time being.

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.600
You eventually find, on the far

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:34.220
northeastern side of the village,

01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:36.740
there is a small building.

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:41.070
It looks like it's mainly used for storage of firewood.

01:50:41.070 --> 01:50:43.590
But the door's open and interior looks pretty much empty,

01:50:43.590 --> 01:50:45.200
like it's been cleaned out.

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.890
MARISHA: Peek my head in, just going to look around,

01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:49.100
knock a little bit. Hello?

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.870
MATT: There's no response and as you glance inside,

01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:54.030
you can see this was a storage, like, a small storage shed.

01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:58.050
And there's one pile of splintered wood in the corner,

01:50:58.050 --> 01:50:59.300
and you can see a lot of tracks

01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:01.190
like things have been moved out.

01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:04.780
Things that were either stored here

01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:07.670
or placed in here have all been removed from the interior

01:51:07.670 --> 01:51:08.710
and it's left to its own devices.

01:51:08.710 --> 01:51:13.710
It's about you know, 10 by 13 feet; it's not huge.

01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:16.113
MARISHA: Okay, I flag down the group.

01:51:16.113 --> 01:51:19.030
Come here; we'll start here for now.

01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:20.645
MATT: Okay.

01:51:20.645 --> 01:51:21.810
As you all make your way inside

01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:22.970
and carefully close the door,

01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:24.320
and make sure you're not being followed,

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.860
which Caduceus keeping on watch.

01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:26.790
Not too hard.

01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:28.250
You feel pretty confident that you're on your own.

01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:31.800
You find a solid, isolated place here in the village

01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:33.040
to take a moment and rest.

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.290
Are you guys taking a short rest?

01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:35.240
What are you doing?

01:51:36.811 --> 01:51:37.980
LIAM: I'm not going to take a short rest,

01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:39.910
but I will take the time that other people do,

01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:42.020
to line the doorway with silver thread

01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:43.990
and cast Alarm ritually,

01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:46.040
and I will take the time to throw up the dome

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:50.480
and I will bring octopus Frumpkin next to me and

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.900
pet him for a little bit,

01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:53.960
and then he can only hold his breath for 30 minutes,

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:55.900
so every 29 minutes precisely,

01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:58.320
I will make him vanish and wait a minute,

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.050
and then bring him back.
LAURA: Is it slowly--

01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:02.017
Are you torturing him?

01:52:02.017 --> 01:52:05.310
I mean, by the end of, like, those 29 minutes is he, like,

01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:06.740
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:08.750
LIAM: That's a good cat.

01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:11.010
LAURA: Maybe at, like, 25 minutes, you should bamf him out.

01:52:11.010 --> 01:52:12.120
LIAM: 25 minutes to-- okay.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.810
SAM: No, it's true, you should listen to Jester

01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:16.400
on how to take care of a pet animal.

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.603
LAURA: Oh shit! Sprinkle, how you doing?

01:52:18.603 --> 01:52:21.139
MATT: (heavy panting)
LAURA: He's fine.

01:52:21.139 --> 01:52:23.780
SAM: How was he in the boiling water?
TRAVIS: (like Sprinkle) Make it end!

01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:26.100
LAURA: It was, like, refreshing.
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:27.990
LIAM: That's the cleanest he's been in weeks.

01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:30.373
MARISHA: It's true, he looks great.
MATT: (pained coughing)

01:52:30.373 --> 01:52:34.202
SAM: I mean, we all lost, like, 60 hit points. Is he okay?

01:52:34.202 --> 01:52:36.300
LAURA: Every time I healed, he healed.

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.923
He's fine.
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) I can feel nothing.

01:52:37.923 --> 01:52:39.990
ASHLEY: He also can breathe underwater

01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:42.900
as when we could.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:44.978
ASHLEY: That's amazing.

01:52:44.978 --> 01:52:47.123
LIAM: I bamf Frumpkin onto Jester's other shoulder

01:52:47.123 --> 01:52:49.625
and Frumpkin just starts to

01:52:49.625 --> 01:52:51.300
get into a very awkward, creepy hug

01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.360
with the three of them and Sprinkle included,

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.740
and just pull them in tight.
MATT: Sprinkle bites back.

01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.095
LIAM: That's okay.

01:52:57.095 --> 01:52:58.245
TRAVIS: Weasel, yeah, he's a weasel.

01:52:58.245 --> 01:52:59.550
MATT: Roll an attack roll for Sprinkle.

01:52:59.550 --> 01:53:02.310
LAURA: Oh, how, what does he--?

01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:04.958
TRAVIS: Sprinkle's eyes boiled while he was underwater.

01:53:04.958 --> 01:53:05.824
MATT: Roll and add three.

01:53:05.824 --> 01:53:06.707
TRAVIS: He's a little cagey.

01:53:06.707 --> 01:53:08.040
LAURA: 14.
MATT: 14.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:09.210
What's the octopus' armor class?

01:53:09.210 --> 01:53:10.476
LIAM: Let me see, let me see.

01:53:10.476 --> 01:53:11.759
TRAVIS: (manic biting)

01:53:12.599 --> 01:53:14.700
LIAM: It is 12.
LAURA: Oh!

01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:16.366
LAURA: What does Sprinkle attack with?

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.568
Bite?
LIAM: See how many hit points here.

01:53:18.568 --> 01:53:19.880
MATT: With a singular--

01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:20.713
LIAM: Oh, two.

01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:25.470
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d4.

01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:27.770
LAURA: Three.
MARISHA: (giggling)

01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:30.230
MATT: Sprinkle is like (hissing)

01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:32.060
and when he gets too close goes (hissing)

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:35.340
and just, like, full-on cartoon (wood chipper)

01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:36.800
like tears around Frumpkin,

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:39.250
until (poofing) Frumpkin vanishes.

01:53:39.250 --> 01:53:43.259
And then is left on the edge of Jester's shoulder. (panting)

01:53:43.259 --> 01:53:46.960
LAURA: Oh no. He's, you know,
he's excitable. It's okay, Sprinkle.

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.153
LIAM: Yeah, that tracks with the day.

01:53:49.153 --> 01:53:52.193
I wander further in and start to cast the dome.

01:53:52.193 --> 01:53:53.401
LAURA: I'm so sorry, Caleb!

01:53:53.401 --> 01:53:54.342
LIAM: Oh, it's all right.

01:53:54.342 --> 01:53:56.120
I like him better with fur tomorrow.

01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:58.612
TRAVIS: Sprinkle's killed more people than Marius.

01:53:58.612 --> 01:54:03.612
(laughter)

01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:05.783
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:54:05.783 --> 01:54:08.590
LIAM: Drop that shit in the dome
once I get it up, thank you.

01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:10.650
Please and thank you.
MARISHA: I drop the shit,

01:54:10.650 --> 01:54:12.940
and I definitely take a short rest.

01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:14.810
MATT: As you guys settle up within the dome

01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:18.048
and prepare yourselves for
the short rest in this safe environment,

01:54:18.048 --> 01:54:18.887
we're going to take a break!

01:54:18.887 --> 01:54:20.239
ALL: Eyy!

01:54:20.239 --> 01:54:22.740
MATT: We'll return to go over the spoils

01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:27.190
and what the next length of this journey entails, shortly.

01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:29.850
So we'll get back here from our break very soon,

01:54:29.850 --> 01:54:31.357
we'll see you guys in a little bit.

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:33.829

Hey critters.

01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:23.940
Laura Bailey here.

01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:26.373
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:55:27.392 --> 01:55:29.653 line:20%
(upbeat trumpet music)
Oh look at this.

01:55:29.653 --> 01:55:31.523 line:20%
Look at the details oh.

01:55:32.895 --> 01:55:34.600 line:20%
(knife sharpens)

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.670
You're only like five clicks away from owning this.

01:55:36.670 --> 01:55:37.679
Maybe more if you have

01:55:37.679 --> 01:55:39.860
a lot of windows open on your browser

01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:42.800
I don't know your life.
(whimsical noises)

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:43.730
It's so cute.

01:55:43.730 --> 01:55:46.440
I can't handle it.
(mouse clicks)

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.560
All this and more.

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:49.839
Now available in the Critical Role shop.

01:55:49.839 --> 01:55:53.089
(upbeat trumpet music)

01:55:59.271 --> 01:56:01.771
(birds chirp)

01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:06.280
I'm a fan of hot air balloon rides

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.233
above the Venetian countryside.

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.250
I'm a fan of Momlan.

01:56:11.250 --> 01:56:12.863
She's always got my back.

01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:16.663
I'm a fan of wine older than Taliesin.

01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:21.663
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:26.390
I'm a fan of emotes by Arsequeef.

01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:27.894
They're neat.

01:56:27.894 --> 01:56:28.727
(radio feedback)

01:56:28.727 --> 01:56:31.990
I'm a fan of a wife so cool people forget I exist.

01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:35.501
Exist exist exist.
(crow caws)

01:56:35.501 --> 01:56:38.669
(ominous noises)

01:56:38.669 --> 01:56:40.171
(booming noises)

01:56:40.171 --> 01:56:42.921
(ominous noises)

01:56:44.037 --> 01:56:48.012
(woman singing high-pitched notes)

01:56:48.012 --> 01:56:50.922
(groaning noises)

01:56:50.922 --> 01:56:53.422
(child cries)

01:56:54.327 --> 01:56:57.827
(heartbeat thumps loudly)

01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:03.377
I'm a fan of wearing your skin as a mask.

01:57:03.377 --> 01:57:06.877
(heartbeat thumps loudly)

01:57:07.789 --> 01:57:10.289
(regal music)

02:09:58.694 --> 02:10:00.154
MATT: And welcome back.

02:10:00.154 --> 02:10:03.204
So as we left off, Mighty Nein,

02:10:03.204 --> 02:10:05.614
you've just situated yourself

02:10:05.614 --> 02:10:07.374
in the remnants of the village of Vo,

02:10:07.374 --> 02:10:08.594
in the middle of its own chaos,

02:10:08.594 --> 02:10:09.904
trying to figure out what it is

02:10:09.904 --> 02:10:14.536
and where its denizens will be going soon.

02:10:14.536 --> 02:10:15.836
What would you like to do?

02:10:17.304 --> 02:10:18.478
SAM: You know!

02:10:18.478 --> 02:10:20.078
LIAM: I'd like to identify some shit!

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:20.911
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10:20.911 --> 02:10:22.102
LAURA: And count up some of this.

02:10:22.102 --> 02:10:23.454
See what kind of jewels we found.

02:10:23.454 --> 02:10:25.804
I want to look for diamonds

02:10:25.804 --> 02:10:27.684
in the hoard of stuff.
MATT: Okay.

02:10:27.684 --> 02:10:29.164
LAURA: I guess we can just open the bag of holding

02:10:29.164 --> 02:10:30.287
and go: Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond.

02:10:30.287 --> 02:10:31.404
TRAVIS: I'll drop off the bag

02:10:31.404 --> 02:10:32.661
if everyone's going to participate in that.

02:10:32.661 --> 02:10:34.944
I'll just keep an eye out the doorway

02:10:34.944 --> 02:10:37.574
just because some people may be renewed shitheads

02:10:37.574 --> 02:10:38.634
and I don't know who's going to be what.

02:10:38.634 --> 02:10:41.244
TALIESIN: I want to start finding
personal effects in the bag.

02:10:41.244 --> 02:10:43.824
TRAVIS: Even with the thread and stuff.

02:10:43.824 --> 02:10:45.654
TALIESIN: Things that obviously belong to somebody,

02:10:45.654 --> 02:10:47.064
if that makes sense.

02:10:47.064 --> 02:10:49.304
Seeing if there's anything like that,

02:10:49.304 --> 02:10:50.264
maybe not.

02:10:50.264 --> 02:10:52.294
Not necessarily things of value, but, you know.

02:10:52.294 --> 02:10:55.584
SAM: Identifying marks or features and stuff.

02:10:55.584 --> 02:10:57.154
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Initials and shit.

02:10:57.154 --> 02:10:59.564
TALIESIN: Diaries or--
TRAVIS: What were those initials, again?

02:10:59.564 --> 02:11:00.544
MATT: You don't find any diaries,

02:11:00.544 --> 02:11:02.742
you find all sorts of rings,

02:11:02.742 --> 02:11:05.154
you find necklaces.

02:11:06.024 --> 02:11:08.164
You find jewel boxes.

02:11:08.164 --> 02:11:12.254
You find all sorts of things that a person would keep,

02:11:12.254 --> 02:11:13.284
you know,

02:11:13.284 --> 02:11:16.759
precious jewelry, gems, and money in when they're traveling.

02:11:18.864 --> 02:11:21.034
Nothing that has any specific

02:11:21.034 --> 02:11:22.144
personal markings at all,

02:11:22.144 --> 02:11:26.354
but you do find all sorts of interesting keepsakes and such.

02:11:26.354 --> 02:11:28.824
TALIESIN: I'm just taking a mental image of anything.

02:11:28.824 --> 02:11:29.657
MATT: Okay.

02:11:31.724 --> 02:11:32.914
You have those sculptures

02:11:32.914 --> 02:11:35.189
that you guys had pulled in there.

02:11:36.694 --> 02:11:40.552
MARISHA: Anything that looks of religious significance

02:11:40.552 --> 02:11:44.052
of the marble and ivory sculptures?

02:11:44.052 --> 02:11:49.052
MATT: You do see one appears
to be an interpretation of Avandra.

02:11:49.268 --> 02:11:50.174
MARISHA: Okay.

02:11:50.174 --> 02:11:53.964
MATT: Which is the the goddess of adventure

02:11:53.964 --> 02:11:56.684
and freedom and the open road.

02:11:57.994 --> 02:12:01.704
And there is one that is an ivory relief

02:12:01.704 --> 02:12:04.584
that resembles that of Pelor.

02:12:04.584 --> 02:12:06.314
The others appear to be art;

02:12:06.314 --> 02:12:09.844
they are sculptures of people, of creatures.

02:12:09.844 --> 02:12:13.164
Some of just simple wood, but polished well.

02:12:13.164 --> 02:12:17.554
Some that appear to be nice marble

02:12:17.554 --> 02:12:19.514
with very minor cracks here and there,

02:12:19.514 --> 02:12:21.664
with chipped elements, a little older.

02:12:24.154 --> 02:12:27.034
It's an array of different things,

02:12:27.034 --> 02:12:29.894
from what you guys grabbed, and you didn't grab everything,

02:12:29.894 --> 02:12:32.912
but you grabbed as much as you could with the time you had.

02:12:34.867 --> 02:12:38.174
Do you want the gems, you were saying?

02:12:38.174 --> 02:12:39.007
Okay.

02:12:40.094 --> 02:12:40.927
You find

02:12:42.314 --> 02:12:46.494
three diamonds, worth 100 gold,

02:12:46.494 --> 02:12:49.984
500 gold, and 700 gold.

02:12:49.984 --> 02:12:52.664
TALIESIN: That's a big deal.
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:56.534
MATT: There is a sizable emerald worth 250 gold.

02:12:56.534 --> 02:12:59.104
SAM: Was that the green one Vilya was talking about?

02:12:59.104 --> 02:13:00.596
MATT: Seems to be.
LAURA: Okay.

02:13:01.824 --> 02:13:06.824
MATT: There is a polished circular jet stone worth 175 gold.

02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:09.029
SAM: Damn!

02:13:09.029 --> 02:13:10.974
MATT: And miscellaneous gems and stones

02:13:10.974 --> 02:13:14.399
that together are worth 2350 gold.

02:13:14.399 --> 02:13:15.924
TRAVIS: Wow!
SAM: (throat stops)

02:13:17.295 --> 02:13:18.664
LAURA: Can we just say a bag-o-gems?

02:13:18.664 --> 02:13:19.497
MATT: Bag-o-gems.

02:13:19.497 --> 02:13:24.497
MARISHA: We've been broke for so long.
LAURA: It's my second bag-o-gems!

02:13:25.930 --> 02:13:27.494
TALIESIN: Scrooge McDuck money pit.

02:13:27.494 --> 02:13:29.351
MATT: The sculptures and art pieces and

02:13:29.351 --> 02:13:32.189
various odds and ends that you find which are, like,

02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:34.914
gold-plated platters and jugs

02:13:34.914 --> 02:13:38.359
and things for table settings and decor.

02:13:39.254 --> 02:13:42.254
All those together-- their worth

02:13:42.254 --> 02:13:44.884
is anywhere from 10 gold to 50 gold.

02:13:44.884 --> 02:13:48.964
All of them together are worth 615 gold pieces

02:13:48.964 --> 02:13:51.694
if you were to sell them at the highest price

02:13:51.694 --> 02:13:52.964
you could possibly sell them for

02:13:52.964 --> 02:13:54.084
at a place that's looking to buy them

02:13:54.084 --> 02:13:56.774
and that would, of course-- As the resale of so many things

02:13:56.774 --> 02:13:58.414
like that, depends on where you go to.

02:13:58.414 --> 02:13:59.247
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:01.007 --> 02:14:03.224
MATT: And for the sake of just keeping all the information

02:14:03.224 --> 02:14:06.104
out there, the coinage that you managed to acquire,

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:07.664
if anyone wants to keep track of this.

02:14:07.664 --> 02:14:08.944
SAM: Are you keeping track of this, Laura?

02:14:08.944 --> 02:14:09.974
LAURA: I'm writing it all down.

02:14:09.974 --> 02:14:12.236
MATT: 651 copper pieces.

02:14:12.236 --> 02:14:15.034
SAM: Well.
TRAVIS: It's a lot.

02:14:15.034 --> 02:14:16.194
MARISHA: Copper.

02:14:16.194 --> 02:14:18.094
ASHLEY: Did you just say 651 gold?
SAM: Copper.

02:14:18.094 --> 02:14:19.094
MARISHA: Copper pieces.

02:14:19.094 --> 02:14:22.164
MATT: 5661 silver pieces.

02:14:22.164 --> 02:14:23.914
LAURA: 5661?

02:14:23.914 --> 02:14:25.574
MATT: Yep.
SAM: Ignore.

02:14:27.554 --> 02:14:30.794
20,144 gold pieces.

02:14:30.794 --> 02:14:32.324
LAURA: 20,000-- how many?

02:14:32.324 --> 02:14:34.804
MATT: 20,144 gold pieces.

02:14:34.804 --> 02:14:36.362
LIAM: That's a lot of paper.

02:14:37.345 --> 02:14:38.428
MARISHA: I'm so happy!

02:14:38.428 --> 02:14:40.744
MATT: And 1305 platinum pieces.

02:14:40.744 --> 02:14:42.924
TRAVIS: No fucking way!

02:14:42.924 --> 02:14:44.444
MARISHA: 1300-- what?

02:14:44.444 --> 02:14:47.034
LIAM: Platinum.
MATT: It's a treasure trove, you guys.

02:14:47.034 --> 02:14:49.592
This is many, many years of collecting,
TRAVIS: I'm so glad we didn't leave him in the

02:14:49.592 --> 02:14:52.100
Astral fucking Sea.
MARISHA: Me too!

02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.414
ASHLEY: Wait, a 1300 and what?

02:14:54.414 --> 02:14:56.354
MATT: 305 platinum.

02:14:56.354 --> 02:14:59.077
LAURA: I'll do the math. I'm dividing it all up.

02:15:00.162 --> 02:15:01.137
ASHLEY: Damn, son.
MATT: That's the coinage

02:15:01.137 --> 02:15:03.531
and the four objects that

02:15:03.531 --> 02:15:04.594
Beauregard managed to--

02:15:04.594 --> 02:15:06.914
TRAVIS: Wow, yeah.
MARISHA: Which Caleb is identifying.

02:15:06.914 --> 02:15:09.144
ASHLEY: Sheesh!
LIAM: Dragging time out,

02:15:09.144 --> 02:15:12.164
I will make a cat, and I will identify all four.

02:15:12.164 --> 02:15:12.997
TRAVIS: Make a cat!

02:15:12.997 --> 02:15:14.064
MATT: Okay.

02:15:14.064 --> 02:15:17.284
I cannot reach you with these particular things.

02:15:17.284 --> 02:15:18.500
SAM: Take a picture and text it?

02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:20.384
MATT: But I can do that, actually.

02:15:20.384 --> 02:15:23.124
ASHLEY: Good idea.
SAM: Caleb, I got this amulet.

02:15:23.124 --> 02:15:23.957
It's yours.

02:15:23.957 --> 02:15:24.854
It's your amulet.

02:15:24.854 --> 02:15:25.884
I found it.

02:15:25.884 --> 02:15:27.414
LIAM: Oh.
SAM: Take it.

02:15:27.414 --> 02:15:29.224
Here, I'll hand it to you.

02:15:30.519 --> 02:15:31.994
(laughter)

02:15:31.994 --> 02:15:34.037
LIAM: You're so tall.

02:15:34.037 --> 02:15:34.870
SAM: There you go.

02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:36.104
LIAM: I'm sitting on the ground. Thank you.

02:15:36.104 --> 02:15:38.534
MARISHA: Veth, did you find my drugs?

02:15:38.534 --> 02:15:41.864
SAM: I found drugs, but we were in the water.

02:15:41.864 --> 02:15:42.697
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:15:42.697 --> 02:15:45.954
SAM: So they are soaked in water.

02:15:45.954 --> 02:15:48.574
So, I mean, they just look like wet drugs.

02:15:48.574 --> 02:15:51.224
MARISHA: You can totally-- there's a drying process.
TALIESIN: Technically boiled

02:15:51.224 --> 02:15:53.104
into tea, actually.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

02:15:53.104 --> 02:15:54.714
MARISHA: It's totally still usable.

02:15:54.714 --> 02:15:56.884
TALIESIN: Really, once you boil
it into tea, I don't think it is.

02:15:56.884 --> 02:15:59.914
SAM: It's in this bag that said "drugs" on it. (laughs)

02:15:59.914 --> 02:16:02.004
MARISHA: I don't know if those
are my drugs, but I'll take them.

02:16:02.004 --> 02:16:03.964
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:16:03.964 --> 02:16:05.144
Are they my drugs?

02:16:08.811 --> 02:16:11.784
SAM: DM, did I find her drugs or other drugs?

02:16:11.784 --> 02:16:13.234
MATT: No, you found her drugs.

02:16:13.234 --> 02:16:14.805
(laughter)

02:16:14.805 --> 02:16:16.374
MATT: I have to rotate all these.
MARISHA: (gasps) My drugs!

02:16:16.374 --> 02:16:18.523
TRAVIS: The bag just says "not Beau's drugs."

02:16:18.523 --> 02:16:19.794
(laughter)

02:16:19.794 --> 02:16:23.016
SAM: That's how she'll label them, so the cops won't look.
MARISHA: Beau's drugs. Do not arrest.

02:16:23.016 --> 02:16:24.549
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:26.946
MARISHA: Do not seize for evidence.

02:16:27.924 --> 02:16:30.147
SAM: Yes, I found my flask. I did.

02:16:30.147 --> 02:16:34.554
But honestly, I haven't really had an appetite

02:16:34.554 --> 02:16:36.994
for "hwhiskey" lately.

02:16:36.994 --> 02:16:40.124
It's kind of gross.

02:16:40.124 --> 02:16:41.194
I prefer--
ASHLEY: Whiskey?

02:16:41.194 --> 02:16:42.027
LIAM: I disagree.
SAM: Yeah.

02:16:42.027 --> 02:16:44.884
TRAVIS: Hwhiskey, hwhiskey.
SAM: Do you like whiskey?

02:16:46.614 --> 02:16:47.830
ASHLEY: Yes, I do.

02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:50.734
SAM: Would you like my flask?

02:16:50.734 --> 02:16:51.942
ASHLEY: I think I'm okay.

02:16:53.734 --> 02:16:55.264
SAM: All right.
ASHLEY: I think I'm okay,

02:16:55.264 --> 02:16:58.404
but it's nice to have around just in-- you know, nice.

02:16:58.404 --> 02:17:00.744
TRAVIS: Veth, that's an incredible gesture.

02:17:00.744 --> 02:17:03.134
You were going to give away your flask?

02:17:03.134 --> 02:17:05.694
SAM: Well, yeah.

02:17:05.694 --> 02:17:10.354
I mean, it's gross. It tastes like-- ugh!

02:17:10.354 --> 02:17:11.404
MARISHA: I'll take it.

02:17:11.404 --> 02:17:13.454
Are you giving away to, like, anybody who wants it?

02:17:13.454 --> 02:17:16.234
Is it like dibsies? Dibsies.

02:17:16.234 --> 02:17:17.067
SAM: You can have it.

02:17:17.067 --> 02:17:19.534
Yeah, I was also-- yes. Yes, you may have it.

02:17:19.534 --> 02:17:20.994
It's, you know,

02:17:20.994 --> 02:17:23.134
it'll look a little littler on you than me.

02:17:23.134 --> 02:17:26.554
TRAVIS: Did you just give Beau an endless flask of alcohol?

02:17:26.554 --> 02:17:27.454
SAM: What's wrong with that?

02:17:27.454 --> 02:17:28.974
I also gave her wet drugs.

02:17:28.974 --> 02:17:30.044
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

02:17:30.044 --> 02:17:31.614
MARISHA: This is the best score.

02:17:31.614 --> 02:17:33.594
TRAVIS: Feel like we are putting stats in the wrong column.

02:17:33.594 --> 02:17:36.814
SAM: However, if we get to a place with a mage

02:17:36.814 --> 02:17:38.694
who can change its enchantment

02:17:38.694 --> 02:17:40.464
to something a little bit lighter,

02:17:40.464 --> 02:17:44.444
like a sherry or a peach schnapps?

02:17:44.444 --> 02:17:46.110
MARISHA: Oh, sure.
SAM: I might take it back.

02:17:46.110 --> 02:17:47.734
TRAVIS: Like a Smirnoff Ice?

02:17:47.734 --> 02:17:49.374
SAM: Yeah, yeah, or Zima.
TALIESIN: Zima.

02:17:49.374 --> 02:17:51.414
I was really hoping for some Zima.

02:17:51.414 --> 02:17:53.624
MARISHA: You can't, like-- it's always whiskey?

02:17:53.624 --> 02:17:56.334
SAM: It's always. I chose it when we made it.

02:17:56.334 --> 02:17:57.594
It's pretty--
MARISHA: Just whiskey.

02:17:57.594 --> 02:17:59.434
ASHLEY: You could hide it and then if we find it,

02:17:59.434 --> 02:18:01.234
you get iced you know, and then you have to chug it.

02:18:01.234 --> 02:18:02.926
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
ASHLEY: Remember that?

02:18:02.926 --> 02:18:04.334
MARISHA: You have to take a knee.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

02:18:05.194 --> 02:18:08.244
SAM: But take it for now and if we can re-chant it,

02:18:08.244 --> 02:18:09.427
MARISHA: Deal!
SAM: I think that's what they say.

02:18:09.427 --> 02:18:11.449
MARISHA: Maybe if we ever go back to a Kamordah,

02:18:11.449 --> 02:18:14.402
we can find one of the vintages there.

02:18:14.402 --> 02:18:16.534
Maybe you can get, like--

02:18:16.534 --> 02:18:18.664
SAM: A rosé?
MARISHA: Yeah, absolutely.

02:18:18.664 --> 02:18:20.572
SAM: A nice, light rosé?

02:18:20.572 --> 02:18:23.724
MARISHA: We've had some good rosés.
TALIESIN: You can have infinite Lionett wine.

02:18:23.724 --> 02:18:24.804
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:18:24.804 --> 02:18:26.794
The Lionett flask, it'd be great.

02:18:26.794 --> 02:18:28.314
SAM: Awesome.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:18:28.314 --> 02:18:29.494
TALIESIN: No reason to ever go home again.

02:18:29.494 --> 02:18:31.184
MATT: I did text you the--
LIAM: I'm looking at it.

02:18:31.184 --> 02:18:32.494
MATT: Oh, okay.
LIAM: Thank you.

02:18:32.494 --> 02:18:34.034
SAM: What'd we get?

02:18:34.034 --> 02:18:38.114
LIAM: Well, one thing is very clear.

02:18:38.114 --> 02:18:42.578
These, I think these were in a case initially,

02:18:42.578 --> 02:18:46.294
are dwarven bolts.

02:18:46.294 --> 02:18:47.544
SAM: Boats?
LIAM: Bolts.

02:18:47.544 --> 02:18:48.808
SAM: Bolts.
LIAM: Bolts.

02:18:48.808 --> 02:18:50.274
SAM: Like crossbow bolts?
LIAM: Correct.

02:18:50.274 --> 02:18:51.549
SAM: (gasps)

02:18:52.814 --> 02:18:54.015
LIAM: I'm going to text them to you.

02:18:54.015 --> 02:18:57.184
They're a little unpredictable.

02:18:57.184 --> 02:18:59.444
SAM: That's my favorite kind.
LIAM: They can react

02:18:59.444 --> 02:19:03.449
in a variety of ways upon striking their target,

02:19:05.474 --> 02:19:07.484
anywhere from freezing the air,

02:19:07.484 --> 02:19:10.234
to bringing death to someone,

02:19:10.234 --> 02:19:12.225
to exploding to shrapnel

02:19:13.184 --> 02:19:15.014
and I think I'm just going to hand these to you now,

02:19:15.014 --> 02:19:17.214
because it doesn't make sense to give them to anyone else.

02:19:17.214 --> 02:19:18.089
SAM: Thank you.

02:19:19.744 --> 02:19:20.577
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:19:21.484 --> 02:19:23.094
LIAM: Then we have some boots,

02:19:24.674 --> 02:19:27.484
a staff, and a coat.

02:19:27.484 --> 02:19:28.775
The boots

02:19:30.867 --> 02:19:33.133
can cause you to fly.

02:19:35.074 --> 02:19:37.274
They make you harder to hit,

02:19:37.274 --> 02:19:41.382
and they crackle with electricity

02:19:41.382 --> 02:19:44.834
when a hostile creature comes within range of you.

02:19:44.834 --> 02:19:46.834
TRAVIS: The boots do?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:19:46.834 --> 02:19:50.904
SAM: You can fly always or just a little?

02:19:52.714 --> 02:19:55.074
LIAM: One time, it seems like.

02:19:55.074 --> 02:19:56.084
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:19:56.084 --> 02:19:57.554
MATT: For one round.
LIAM: In a pinch,

02:19:57.554 --> 02:19:59.174
you can get the hell out of Dodge.

02:19:59.174 --> 02:20:01.274
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay.
MATT: Or into Dodge,

02:20:01.274 --> 02:20:03.294
and everything you go by

02:20:03.294 --> 02:20:05.864
as you travel through Dodge takes damage.

02:20:05.864 --> 02:20:07.356
LAURA: Oh, wow.

02:20:08.734 --> 02:20:09.876
LIAM: There is a staff.

02:20:10.814 --> 02:20:13.284
A quarterstaff that is quite powerful

02:20:13.284 --> 02:20:15.164
to strike someone with,

02:20:15.164 --> 02:20:18.024
but also you can wield it an arc

02:20:18.924 --> 02:20:22.930
and send a wave of energy towards a creature

02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:24.343
within range of you.

02:20:25.344 --> 02:20:26.344
MARISHA: I'm listening.

02:20:28.354 --> 02:20:32.024
LIAM: And then, this coat,

02:20:32.024 --> 02:20:34.582
which is a very fine

02:20:34.582 --> 02:20:38.434
Concordian nobleman coat,

02:20:38.434 --> 02:20:43.434
and it would be useful for me-- for anyone, really--

02:20:43.494 --> 02:20:46.731
to make them a little more impervious to damage

02:20:46.731 --> 02:20:49.804
and can magically shift

02:20:49.804 --> 02:20:54.574
to help protect you from different kinds of attacks

02:20:54.574 --> 02:20:55.407
and damage.

02:20:58.284 --> 02:21:03.284
So. Three very rare objects.

02:21:03.644 --> 02:21:05.654
TRAVIS: Do they all require attunement?

02:21:05.654 --> 02:21:06.487
LAURA: I'm assuming.

02:21:08.024 --> 02:21:09.624
LIAM: The boots do not.

02:21:12.278 --> 02:21:13.794
The staff and the coat.

02:21:13.794 --> 02:21:16.834
TRAVIS: Do the boots come with a speed bonus at all?

02:21:19.284 --> 02:21:20.117
LIAM: No.

02:21:20.117 --> 02:21:23.474
It is just one moment or twice

02:21:23.474 --> 02:21:26.214
because they can be restored after a long rest.

02:21:26.214 --> 02:21:31.154
You can use them to fly very fast to get away

02:21:31.154 --> 02:21:35.124
and it's hard for people to hit you as you zoom by

02:21:35.124 --> 02:21:37.274
and they will get fucked up if they try it.

02:21:38.515 --> 02:21:39.844
LAURA: It's cool.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:21:40.744 --> 02:21:42.144
<i>Ja</i>, it's a lot to process.

02:21:45.834 --> 02:21:47.364
TALIESIN: Do they only work twice ever

02:21:47.364 --> 02:21:49.114
or just twice a day?
LIAM: A day.

02:21:49.114 --> 02:21:51.326
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: After a long rest or a short rest?

02:21:51.326 --> 02:21:52.174
LIAM: Long.

02:21:52.174 --> 02:21:53.965
LAURA: So once a day?

02:21:53.965 --> 02:21:56.194
TALIESIN: Twice, then a long rest.

02:21:56.194 --> 02:21:57.027
LAURA: No.

02:21:57.027 --> 02:21:58.544
LIAM: Once per long rest, oh, yeah.

02:21:58.544 --> 02:22:00.954
LAURA: So once a day?
TALIESIN: Once a day.

02:22:00.954 --> 02:22:02.614
LIAM: Yes, yes, correct.

02:22:02.614 --> 02:22:06.394
SAM: Matthew, how many of these bolts are there?

02:22:06.394 --> 02:22:07.884
Three.

02:22:07.884 --> 02:22:08.744
TRAVIS: And then they're gone?

02:22:08.744 --> 02:22:11.569
LIAM: But this is a very powerful bo staff, Beau.

02:22:13.484 --> 02:22:16.156
MARISHA: It's incredibly attractive.

02:22:17.994 --> 02:22:19.361
Very sexy staff.

02:22:20.944 --> 02:22:23.704
TRAVIS: Caduceus, what's your melee weapon of choice?

02:22:24.594 --> 02:22:26.144
TALIESIN: I mean, it's not really of choice.

02:22:26.144 --> 02:22:27.994
I'd rather not use anything at all,

02:22:27.994 --> 02:22:30.114
but I have a staff. It's not bad.

02:22:30.114 --> 02:22:30.947
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:22:31.994 --> 02:22:33.194
TALIESIN: I'm not very good with it.

02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:39.984
TRAVIS: Just trying to recall the
last time I saw you crack someone.

02:22:39.984 --> 02:22:42.106
TALIESIN: I try and stay away from--

02:22:42.106 --> 02:22:44.364
If someone's close enough to crack me,

02:22:44.364 --> 02:22:46.314
I don't necessarily know if that's a good thing,

02:22:46.314 --> 02:22:47.724
so, I try and avoid that.

02:22:47.724 --> 02:22:50.614
TRAVIS: You're probably messed up by that point.

02:22:50.614 --> 02:22:53.784
TALIESIN: Usually I have a couple
things that can keep people away,

02:22:53.784 --> 02:22:55.104
you know.

02:22:55.104 --> 02:22:59.007
LAURA: I have some divisions of coin here,

02:23:00.034 --> 02:23:03.194
depending on how you guys want to play it.

02:23:03.194 --> 02:23:05.494
I kept a little bit off to the side for Vilya.

02:23:08.264 --> 02:23:09.604
SAM: Sure, yes, of course.

02:23:09.604 --> 02:23:12.234
LAURA: Should she get an equal amount

02:23:12.234 --> 02:23:15.034
or should she get, like, some?

02:23:15.034 --> 02:23:16.634
MARISHA: Of money?

02:23:16.634 --> 02:23:17.634
SAM: She was with us.

02:23:18.844 --> 02:23:19.944
She should--

02:23:21.233 --> 02:23:23.944
All. I mean, as much as we do.

02:23:23.944 --> 02:23:25.914
LAURA: Yeah?
SAM: At least.

02:23:25.914 --> 02:23:28.914
TRAVIS: Are we dividing it up between ourselves and Vilya

02:23:28.914 --> 02:23:33.881
or are we also setting some aside for the village?

02:23:36.498 --> 02:23:39.134
Not that I even know how to begin to do that.

02:23:39.134 --> 02:23:39.967
LAURA: Yeah.

02:23:39.967 --> 02:23:41.394
TALIESIN: How many villagers are there?

02:23:42.744 --> 02:23:43.744
MATT: A little over 100.

02:23:45.574 --> 02:23:46.414
LAURA: Well.

02:23:46.414 --> 02:23:50.441
TRAVIS: That is certainly enough gold to go around.

02:23:51.344 --> 02:23:52.177
SAM: It is theirs.
LAURA: We could

02:23:52.177 --> 02:23:54.664
also make another trip in tomorrow

02:23:54.664 --> 02:23:56.444
and see if we can get more gold

02:23:56.444 --> 02:23:58.044
for the rest of the people here.

02:23:59.604 --> 02:24:04.024
MARISHA: Maybe we divide what we have here

02:24:04.024 --> 02:24:06.954
that no one else is aware of,

02:24:06.954 --> 02:24:09.614
and then we give the rest that we find in the cave

02:24:09.614 --> 02:24:11.621
to the village tomorrow.

02:24:14.544 --> 02:24:15.764
LAURA: Should we make Vilya

02:24:15.764 --> 02:24:18.174
have an even share of our stuff today?

02:24:18.174 --> 02:24:19.104
MARISHA: Maybe.

02:24:19.104 --> 02:24:20.244
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:24:20.244 --> 02:24:22.461
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to need to do some math again.

02:24:24.574 --> 02:24:28.294
LIAM: DM, out of curiosity, would this coat

02:24:28.294 --> 02:24:30.734
play with the elven chain?

02:24:30.734 --> 02:24:32.044
Or no?

02:24:32.044 --> 02:24:34.404
MATT: It plays over any light armor.

02:24:34.404 --> 02:24:35.654
LIAM: Okay.

02:24:35.654 --> 02:24:37.154
MARISHA: That staff is--
LIAM: I think the elven chain,

02:24:37.154 --> 02:24:39.479
it says medium in equipment.

02:24:40.414 --> 02:24:41.372
TRAVIS: Staff is dope.

02:24:42.424 --> 02:24:44.884
MARISHA: Has plus two to attack and damage rolls.

02:24:44.884 --> 02:24:46.944
ASHLEY: What is it?
TRAVIS: That's a plus two?

02:24:46.944 --> 02:24:50.195
MARISHA: To attack and damage rolls.
TRAVIS: I heard.

02:24:50.195 --> 02:24:51.847
That's big.

02:24:51.847 --> 02:24:53.174
MARISHA: And then some other stuff.

02:24:53.174 --> 02:24:54.531
LIAM: So one of them, okay.

02:25:04.064 --> 02:25:07.944
MARISHA: And it's called the Belabor.

02:25:07.944 --> 02:25:10.034
Which is just so appropriate for Beau.

02:25:10.034 --> 02:25:11.524
TRAVIS: The Belabor?
ASHLEY: The Belabor?

02:25:11.524 --> 02:25:13.464
MARISHA: Belabor.
TRAVIS: Like "belabor the point"?

02:25:13.464 --> 02:25:17.114
MARISHA: Yep, that's the one. Same Belabor.

02:25:17.114 --> 02:25:18.539
(laughs)

02:25:18.539 --> 02:25:20.404
TRAVIS: How else is that word used?

02:25:20.404 --> 02:25:21.464
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:25:21.464 --> 02:25:24.477
TRAVIS: I don't want to belabor your sandwich.

02:25:24.477 --> 02:25:26.389
(laughter)

02:25:26.389 --> 02:25:29.114
MARISHA: I don't want to belabor--
your face with this staff!

02:25:30.154 --> 02:25:33.344
LAURA: Everybody gets 81 copper,

02:25:33.344 --> 02:25:34.177
bleep, bleep, bleep.

02:25:34.177 --> 02:25:35.664
TRAVIS: Oh, 81, yeah.

02:25:35.664 --> 02:25:38.109
LAURA: 707 silver.

02:25:39.594 --> 02:25:41.224
TRAVIS: 700 and?
LAURA: Seven.

02:25:41.224 --> 02:25:43.024
MARISHA: 707.

02:25:43.024 --> 02:25:44.794
ASHLEY: 707.
TRAVIS: Jesus.

02:25:44.794 --> 02:25:48.154
LAURA: 2518 gold.

02:25:49.422 --> 02:25:50.794
MARISHA: Wow.

02:25:50.794 --> 02:25:53.481
LAURA: And 163 platinum.

02:25:54.714 --> 02:25:58.224
SAM: Unless we give away a lot of this tonight.

02:25:59.724 --> 02:26:02.244
LAURA: Well, Vilya gets an equal share of all those things.

02:26:02.244 --> 02:26:04.044
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: And she can choose to

02:26:05.524 --> 02:26:07.712
do what she wants with it.

02:26:07.712 --> 02:26:11.204
LAURA: And, you know,

02:26:12.174 --> 02:26:14.414
all that stuff is still in the cave.

02:26:14.414 --> 02:26:16.531
People can go get other stuff.

02:26:17.464 --> 02:26:18.794
Or we can share all of this stuff

02:26:18.794 --> 02:26:20.544
if that's what you guys want to do.

02:26:20.544 --> 02:26:23.347
TRAVIS: It'll just depend on
how much is actually left there.

02:26:23.347 --> 02:26:24.397
A fair amount, yes?

02:26:24.397 --> 02:26:26.554
We were leaving in such a hurry.

02:26:26.554 --> 02:26:30.234
Or did we do a really good job of being Hoovers? (slurps)

02:26:31.954 --> 02:26:32.996
We'll find out.

02:26:32.996 --> 02:26:35.334
MARISHA: DM, do we know how much we might have

02:26:35.334 --> 02:26:37.924
maybe left behind in the time?

02:26:37.924 --> 02:26:40.954
MATT: The only two that were hanging back long enough

02:26:40.954 --> 02:26:44.849
to know would be Veth and Yasha.

02:26:45.811 --> 02:26:48.764
And you guys scooped the majority,

02:26:48.764 --> 02:26:52.014
I'd say about--

02:26:52.956 --> 02:26:56.581
we'll say, four fifths of it.

02:26:58.774 --> 02:26:59.607
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:27:02.234 --> 02:27:03.850
TRAVIS: Probably going to have to be some

02:27:03.850 --> 02:27:06.367
redistribution plans

02:27:07.264 --> 02:27:11.474
so we don't feel like huge festering assholes.

02:27:11.474 --> 02:27:13.334
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: All right.

02:27:13.334 --> 02:27:15.394
LAURA: Do you want me to not add these things to our

02:27:15.394 --> 02:27:17.244
or can everybody give what they want?

02:27:18.354 --> 02:27:20.554
TALIESIN: When it comes time, we'll
figure out what's appropriate,

02:27:20.554 --> 02:27:21.854
and we can all go in.

02:27:21.854 --> 02:27:24.304
MARISHA: I'll set aside my share, but I won't

02:27:25.374 --> 02:27:28.721
add it to my previous pot yet, I guess.

02:27:28.721 --> 02:27:29.934
TALIESIN: I have a list.

02:27:29.934 --> 02:27:31.074
MARISHA: Okay.

02:27:31.074 --> 02:27:33.444
LAURA: I'll make a little bag for Vilya so she can have

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:36.384
the share that we divided up for her.

02:27:36.384 --> 02:27:38.467
MATT: Okay. Probably be a big bag,

02:27:38.467 --> 02:27:39.779
because that's a lot of coin.

02:27:39.779 --> 02:27:41.714
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:27:41.714 --> 02:27:43.734
TRAVIS: While that's going on,

02:27:43.734 --> 02:27:46.974
has anyone, like, followed us here,

02:27:46.974 --> 02:27:49.884
looking at us, keeping an eye as they walk by, anything?

02:27:49.884 --> 02:27:50.717
LAURA: I mean, we have the door shut.

02:27:50.717 --> 02:27:52.092
MATT: You guys are in inside with the door shut,

02:27:52.092 --> 02:27:54.358
in the shed, but you can peer through.

02:27:54.358 --> 02:27:55.374
TRAVIS: I said I was standing at the door

02:27:55.374 --> 02:27:57.604
to see if somebody was going to try and--

02:27:57.604 --> 02:27:59.354
MATT: Make a perception check, then.

02:28:00.727 --> 02:28:01.735
[distant siren]

02:28:01.735 --> 02:28:03.174
TRAVIS: Woo!

02:28:03.174 --> 02:28:04.425
17.

02:28:04.425 --> 02:28:06.484
[distant siren]

02:28:06.484 --> 02:28:08.489
TALIESIN: That's the first time I've heard--
MARISHA: Is that the paddy wagon?

02:28:08.489 --> 02:28:10.660
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was just going to say.
SAM: (imitating siren)

02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:13.834
TALIESIN: First time I've heard that in this room.

02:28:13.834 --> 02:28:15.244
TRAVIS: There was a retro fire engine.

02:28:15.244 --> 02:28:16.374
ASHLEY: It was like a crank.

02:28:16.374 --> 02:28:18.814
TRAVIS: Yeah, one of those old--

02:28:18.814 --> 02:28:21.184
TALIESIN: It's a clown car.

02:28:22.814 --> 02:28:25.294
MATT: So looking around,

02:28:25.294 --> 02:28:27.584
nobody is specifically approaching,

02:28:27.584 --> 02:28:32.150
but you do see,

02:28:33.008 --> 02:28:34.594
not terribly far away,

02:28:34.594 --> 02:28:36.354
towards the base one of the larger trees

02:28:36.354 --> 02:28:38.144
that contains many elements

02:28:38.144 --> 02:28:42.260
of the upper reaches

02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:44.194
of tree-based abodes

02:28:44.194 --> 02:28:45.684
and the bridges that connect,

02:28:46.574 --> 02:28:49.324
you see a small group of individuals being led by Terra,

02:28:50.304 --> 02:28:55.304
who have quite a number of sacks full of weapons

02:28:55.534 --> 02:28:57.394
at the ready, and they're all looking

02:28:57.394 --> 02:29:01.624
like they're keeping out of sight.

02:29:01.624 --> 02:29:03.034
Then Terra glances over

02:29:03.034 --> 02:29:05.194
and makes eye contact with you and goes like--

02:29:13.184 --> 02:29:15.394
TRAVIS: How long to get that dome up?

02:29:15.394 --> 02:29:17.384
LIAM: Well, it was the first thing I did, so.

02:29:17.384 --> 02:29:18.994
TRAVIS: Oh good, it's up.

02:29:19.994 --> 02:29:21.444
MATT: As Terra has your attention,

02:29:22.554 --> 02:29:24.266
she goes ahead and goes--

02:29:32.194 --> 02:29:34.354
TRAVIS: Anyone want to go for a stroll?

02:29:34.354 --> 02:29:38.232
I spotted Terra and apparently she wants to talk.

02:29:39.378 --> 02:29:40.311
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:29:41.511 --> 02:29:42.952
TRAVIS: We don't all have to go.

02:29:44.444 --> 02:29:45.824
LAURA: Some of--
MARISHA: Do you--?

02:29:45.824 --> 02:29:47.634
LAURA: I'll stay here and--
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll come with.

02:29:47.634 --> 02:29:48.467
LAURA: I imagine this

02:29:48.467 --> 02:29:51.304
division stuff is going to take a while.
MARISHA: Do you want to "<i>talk</i>"?

02:29:51.304 --> 02:29:53.414
TRAVIS: I would prefer to talk first.

02:29:53.414 --> 02:29:55.014
MARISHA: Then I'll stay.

02:29:55.014 --> 02:29:55.994
TRAVIS: Fair enough.
TALIESIN: I'll come.

02:29:55.994 --> 02:29:57.497
TRAVIS: Very good foresight, Beau.

02:29:57.497 --> 02:29:59.364
I appreciate that.

02:29:59.364 --> 02:30:02.214
MARISHA: I'll watch from from a distance.

02:30:02.214 --> 02:30:03.908
TRAVIS: ♪ From a distance ♪
ASHLEY: I'll come with.

02:30:03.908 --> 02:30:04.908
MARISHA: ♪ From a distance ♪

02:30:04.908 --> 02:30:07.154
TRAVIS: Yasha and I will take a stroll.

02:30:07.154 --> 02:30:08.164
TALIESIN: Oh, you two?

02:30:08.164 --> 02:30:10.489
TRAVIS: If you hear terrible screaming--

02:30:10.489 --> 02:30:11.788
TALIESIN: I'm coming along.

02:30:11.788 --> 02:30:12.804
All right, I want to see this.

02:30:12.804 --> 02:30:14.074
LAURA: The three of you?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:30:14.074 --> 02:30:17.464
TRAVIS: What was the distance to Terra? 50 yards, 100 yards?

02:30:17.464 --> 02:30:18.414
MATT: About 40 yards.

02:30:20.144 --> 02:30:21.104
TRAVIS: We'll make our way over.

02:30:21.104 --> 02:30:22.654
MATT: As you guys make your way over,

02:30:22.654 --> 02:30:24.464
you can see there's an open doorway

02:30:24.464 --> 02:30:27.044
that her and her crew are leaning next to.

02:30:27.044 --> 02:30:29.054
They head inside the building

02:30:29.054 --> 02:30:30.624
and Terra heads inside as well.

02:30:32.204 --> 02:30:33.037
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:30:33.884 --> 02:30:36.214
Inside, even better.

02:30:36.214 --> 02:30:37.814
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Any reservations?

02:30:40.284 --> 02:30:41.117
ASHLEY: No.

02:30:41.981 --> 02:30:43.594
TRAVIS: That's all I needed to hear.

02:30:45.224 --> 02:30:46.824
Is the door open?
MATT: It is.

02:30:48.154 --> 02:30:51.184
TRAVIS: Standing outside, how many can we see inside?

02:30:51.184 --> 02:30:52.534
MATT: You see four individuals.

02:30:54.984 --> 02:30:56.651
TRAVIS: I'll knock on the doorframe.

02:30:58.274 --> 02:31:00.844
Could you make room for two more?

02:31:01.844 --> 02:31:03.244
LAURA: Caduceus came with you two.

02:31:03.244 --> 02:31:04.077
TRAVIS: Three more?

02:31:06.324 --> 02:31:07.990
MATT: (as Terra) "I think we can do that."

02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:10.084
TRAVIS: I will slide in.

02:31:10.084 --> 02:31:11.977
Door open, door shut?

02:31:13.284 --> 02:31:14.484
MATT: "Go ahead and close it."

02:31:16.924 --> 02:31:18.124
TRAVIS: Yasha closes the door.

02:31:20.254 --> 02:31:21.087
MATT: "So...

02:31:23.845 --> 02:31:25.827
"I imagine, much like us, you don't have much business

02:31:25.827 --> 02:31:27.610
"to remain in this space, right?"

02:31:29.354 --> 02:31:33.744
TRAVIS: Not a lot. More-- actually, perhaps a fair bit more.

02:31:33.744 --> 02:31:35.624
We did come here for a different reason,

02:31:35.624 --> 02:31:39.362
and that event is forthcoming.

02:31:41.144 --> 02:31:43.974
Perhaps we should actually start off on a different foot.

02:31:43.974 --> 02:31:46.244
I think you know all of our names,

02:31:46.244 --> 02:31:49.324
but I'm not entirely sure that we really know yours.

02:31:51.374 --> 02:31:52.884
MATT: They look at each other.

02:31:55.554 --> 02:31:57.654
"You can call me Kotho.

02:31:57.654 --> 02:31:59.037
"That's all you need."

02:32:02.654 --> 02:32:03.487
TRAVIS: Excellent.

02:32:05.034 --> 02:32:06.226
MATT: Make a history check.

02:32:06.226 --> 02:32:07.801
LAURA: Whoa.
SAM: Ooh.

02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:11.674
MARISHA: You said Kotho?
TRAVIS: Kotho.

02:32:11.674 --> 02:32:13.334
LIAM: The pirate queen!
ASHLEY: Kotho?

02:32:13.334 --> 02:32:14.414
Oh, I hope so.

02:32:14.414 --> 02:32:16.724
TRAVIS: 14.
MATT: 14.

02:32:16.724 --> 02:32:18.644
You have heard the name before.

02:32:18.644 --> 02:32:20.644
You don't have a lot of detail, but

02:32:21.484 --> 02:32:23.214
there are some figures in the Menagerie Coast

02:32:23.214 --> 02:32:24.414
that build a reputation.

02:32:25.504 --> 02:32:27.644
Some because they have some sort of massive

02:32:27.644 --> 02:32:30.104
criminal enterprise, because there are rumors

02:32:30.104 --> 02:32:34.264
of elements of makeshift nobility

02:32:34.264 --> 02:32:37.844
that have risen up or caused some sort of intrigue.

02:32:39.574 --> 02:32:41.994
Kotho, however, is one of a handful

02:32:41.994 --> 02:32:44.794
of well known bounty hunters across the Menagerie Coast.

02:32:46.444 --> 02:32:48.484
Particularly one that they say one day

02:32:48.484 --> 02:32:51.114
just quit the game and left

02:32:51.114 --> 02:32:53.794
about 10 years ago, and hasn't been heard from since.

02:32:53.794 --> 02:32:57.354
TRAVIS: 10 years.

02:32:57.354 --> 02:32:58.434
Right.

02:32:58.434 --> 02:32:59.534
Kotho.

02:33:00.696 --> 02:33:03.244
MATT: "I see the look of recognition in your eyes."

02:33:03.244 --> 02:33:04.704
TRAVIS: I hope you'll take it as flattery

02:33:04.704 --> 02:33:08.424
that your name, even all this time later,

02:33:08.424 --> 02:33:11.544
still carries great weight from the Menagerie Coast.

02:33:11.544 --> 02:33:12.377
MATT: "Certainly.

02:33:13.444 --> 02:33:15.474
"You all came in a ship, right?"

02:33:15.474 --> 02:33:16.584
TRAVIS: We did,

02:33:16.584 --> 02:33:20.634
however, we were trying to throw off the scent

02:33:20.634 --> 02:33:22.959
of one dragon turtle.

02:33:23.824 --> 02:33:26.374
We seem to have pissed it off and since we've been here,

02:33:26.374 --> 02:33:28.434
it is (clears throat)

02:33:28.434 --> 02:33:29.559
no longer afloat.

02:33:30.689 --> 02:33:32.572
MATT: (sighs) "Fucking shit!"

02:33:36.084 --> 02:33:37.644
TRAVIS: It is discouraging, I know.

02:33:37.644 --> 02:33:41.596
The other three that are with Kotho,

02:33:42.524 --> 02:33:44.034
any recognition of their faces,

02:33:44.034 --> 02:33:45.754
anything that rings any bells?

02:33:45.754 --> 02:33:46.587
MATT: Not particularly.

02:33:46.587 --> 02:33:51.564
You see one younger, scrawny looking elven gentlemen.

02:33:52.554 --> 02:33:57.524
You see a halfling female, a little older,

02:33:57.524 --> 02:33:59.804
muscular, big upper arms.

02:33:59.804 --> 02:34:04.579
And the last one you can see,

02:34:04.579 --> 02:34:05.529
they look human,

02:34:05.529 --> 02:34:06.754
but there's something about them

02:34:06.754 --> 02:34:08.876
that seems different.

02:34:10.704 --> 02:34:14.594
The features seem to almost shift

02:34:14.594 --> 02:34:16.724
at certain points of light that catch them.

02:34:17.874 --> 02:34:21.054
Like there's a pearlesence from certain angles

02:34:21.054 --> 02:34:23.104
that you have to catch yourself on.

02:34:24.744 --> 02:34:26.494
TRAVIS: If you've been here for 10 years,

02:34:27.354 --> 02:34:29.014
in speaking with Vilya,

02:34:29.014 --> 02:34:32.608
she said she'd been here closer to 20 to 25.

02:34:35.584 --> 02:34:38.854
Have you found out who the first members

02:34:38.854 --> 02:34:40.287
of this village were?

02:34:44.564 --> 02:34:47.086
MATT: "I haven't. Don't really care."

02:34:48.414 --> 02:34:50.347
TRAVIS: I take it from your

02:34:51.605 --> 02:34:53.654
urgency, that it is quite important

02:34:53.654 --> 02:34:55.564
for you to get off this island?

02:34:55.564 --> 02:34:57.932
MATT: "As soon as possible.

02:34:57.932 --> 02:35:00.294
"Do you have a way of doing so?"

02:35:00.294 --> 02:35:05.294
TRAVIS: Perhaps. We may be able to assist each other.

02:35:05.624 --> 02:35:06.494
In a matter of days,

02:35:06.494 --> 02:35:07.724
there will be a fair number of people

02:35:07.724 --> 02:35:08.974
traveling to this island.

02:35:09.854 --> 02:35:14.094
Some may be capable, others, perhaps not so much.

02:35:14.094 --> 02:35:16.434
If your reputation is as I remember,

02:35:16.434 --> 02:35:18.644
you seem to be the type that might be able

02:35:18.644 --> 02:35:21.134
to play that to your advantage.

02:35:21.134 --> 02:35:24.156
As they arrive, and they will--

02:35:25.554 --> 02:35:27.087
well, I'll leave it to your imagination

02:35:27.087 --> 02:35:28.704
as to what your options might be.

02:35:29.574 --> 02:35:31.134
MATT: "Fair enough."

02:35:31.134 --> 02:35:34.854
TRAVIS: In the meantime, we don't really know these people.

02:35:34.854 --> 02:35:38.024
I'm assuming that you don't either,

02:35:38.024 --> 02:35:41.454
but if you would, keep an ear out,

02:35:41.454 --> 02:35:44.864
and as those arrivals start to filter in,

02:35:45.794 --> 02:35:50.727
we'll make sure that you find your way to a possibility.

02:35:53.944 --> 02:35:55.194
MATT: "I appreciate that."

02:35:57.624 --> 02:35:59.884
TRAVIS: Well, if we can be of any more assistance--

02:35:59.884 --> 02:36:01.527
MATT: The door is already (creaking)

02:36:01.527 --> 02:36:02.360
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:36:04.478 --> 02:36:05.634
Have a great evening.

02:36:06.644 --> 02:36:07.477
Shall we?

02:36:08.364 --> 02:36:09.759
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Right.

02:36:11.237 --> 02:36:12.634
MATT: You all walk out. You can see the four of them

02:36:12.634 --> 02:36:16.744
are still holding that distant scowl,

02:36:16.744 --> 02:36:20.304
that intense, at-the-ready sense.

02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:22.204
You're very familiar with it.

02:36:22.204 --> 02:36:23.037
TRAVIS: I'll pause.

02:36:24.354 --> 02:36:25.187
Turn around,

02:36:26.524 --> 02:36:29.744
step back through. One last question.

02:36:29.744 --> 02:36:34.144
Before you went missing,

02:36:34.144 --> 02:36:35.586
who you were looking for?

02:36:37.204 --> 02:36:38.154
MATT: (quietly) "What's it to you?"

02:36:39.514 --> 02:36:41.764
(more emphatic) "What's it to you?"

02:36:41.764 --> 02:36:45.584
TRAVIS: I-- Call it a matter of curiosity.

02:36:45.584 --> 02:36:47.220
Wouldn't it be strange if they were,

02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:49.904
I don't know, here?

02:36:49.904 --> 02:36:52.762
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes, come on.

02:36:56.604 --> 02:36:58.061
TRAVIS: 19.

02:36:58.061 --> 02:36:59.302
SAM: Damn.

02:37:00.216 --> 02:37:01.457
LIAM: Face man.

02:37:04.654 --> 02:37:05.824
MATT: "I was looking for someone

02:37:05.824 --> 02:37:07.614
"who stole something very important

02:37:07.614 --> 02:37:09.556
"to an employer of mine at the time."

02:37:16.104 --> 02:37:19.004
TRAVIS: Any idea what they stole?

02:37:19.004 --> 02:37:20.483
MATT: "It was a weapon."

02:37:20.483 --> 02:37:21.599
TRAVIS: Weapon.

02:37:22.834 --> 02:37:24.284
I take it you didn't find it.

02:37:25.514 --> 02:37:26.347
MATT: "No.

02:37:28.254 --> 02:37:30.114
"They evaded us for a while,

02:37:30.114 --> 02:37:32.064
"and then they disappeared as well.

02:37:33.234 --> 02:37:35.134
"But they're not on this island.

02:37:35.134 --> 02:37:39.124
"We've spent the past few hours,

02:37:39.124 --> 02:37:42.094
"trying to see if perhaps we had ever crossed paths here,

02:37:42.094 --> 02:37:43.154
"but no."

02:37:43.154 --> 02:37:45.064
TRAVIS: An employer from the Menagerie Coast?

02:37:45.064 --> 02:37:45.897
MATT: "Indeed."

02:37:47.834 --> 02:37:48.667
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:37:49.774 --> 02:37:52.944
Hopefully your time here will not be too much longer.

02:37:54.504 --> 02:37:55.637
Evening.

02:37:55.637 --> 02:37:56.834
Shall we?

02:37:56.834 --> 02:37:58.324
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's go.

02:37:58.324 --> 02:37:59.494
MATT: All right.

02:37:59.494 --> 02:38:03.184
TRAVIS: I'll get back and fill everyone in on who Kotho is,

02:38:03.184 --> 02:38:06.844
the reputation that she has

02:38:06.844 --> 02:38:09.719
and just the general

02:38:10.744 --> 02:38:13.110
demeanor of her group.

02:38:14.184 --> 02:38:15.694
Also, there were two in her group

02:38:15.694 --> 02:38:17.264
that seemed to have a strange--

02:38:17.264 --> 02:38:18.522
Did you see the--?

02:38:18.522 --> 02:38:19.705
ASHLEY: Yeah, they were kind of

02:38:21.474 --> 02:38:22.834
shiny.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:38:22.834 --> 02:38:24.643
SAM: They were shiny people?
LAURA: Shiny how?

02:38:24.643 --> 02:38:25.884
What do you mean shiny?

02:38:25.884 --> 02:38:28.024
TRAVIS: Sometimes when you see fish in a certain light.

02:38:28.024 --> 02:38:28.857
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:38:28.857 --> 02:38:30.614
LAURA: Like iridescent?

02:38:30.614 --> 02:38:32.034
TRAVIS: Yeah, or pearlescent,

02:38:32.034 --> 02:38:34.274
like a pearl, almost.
ASHLEY: Pearlescent.

02:38:34.274 --> 02:38:37.124
LIAM: Their skin?
LAURA: Does that sound familiar?

02:38:37.124 --> 02:38:37.957
TALIESIN: Like this.

02:38:38.914 --> 02:38:40.146
Like this.

02:38:40.146 --> 02:38:41.312
TRAVIS: What are you doing?
SAM: What is that?

02:38:41.312 --> 02:38:43.276
LAURA: It's his clothes.
TALIESIN: Yeah, like that.

02:38:43.276 --> 02:38:45.444
LAURA: The cloth.
LIAM: Yeah, the gossamer.

02:38:45.444 --> 02:38:47.554
TRAVIS: I totally remember.
LIAM: The sleeves.

02:38:47.554 --> 02:38:50.224
MATT: I would say just because of your nature, Yasha,

02:38:50.224 --> 02:38:52.204
you gather there probably was a hint of celestial

02:38:52.204 --> 02:38:53.037
in their bloodline.

02:38:53.037 --> 02:38:55.894
MARISHA: (gasps) Oh.

02:38:55.894 --> 02:38:58.274
SAM: How many people were with Kotho?

02:38:58.274 --> 02:38:59.494
TRAVIS: Three.

02:38:59.494 --> 02:39:02.504
SAM: And they're bounty hunters, or they work for Kotho?

02:39:02.504 --> 02:39:05.794
TRAVIS: She was, and I assume that they were with her,

02:39:05.794 --> 02:39:07.054
or at least are now.

02:39:07.054 --> 02:39:08.284
SAM: And even though they were given

02:39:08.284 --> 02:39:11.714
this bounty hunting mission 10 years ago,

02:39:11.714 --> 02:39:13.911
they wouldn't reveal any details?

02:39:13.911 --> 02:39:17.294
TRAVIS: No, they did say they had been searching for someone

02:39:17.294 --> 02:39:19.864
that stole a weapon from an employer,

02:39:19.864 --> 02:39:21.434
along the Menagerie Coast.

02:39:21.434 --> 02:39:24.844
LAURA: (laughs) No, it couldn't possibly be.

02:39:24.844 --> 02:39:25.884
SAM, TRAVIS, and TALIESIN: What?

02:39:28.813 --> 02:39:30.521
LAURA: Twig--

02:39:30.521 --> 02:39:32.524
Wouldn't it be funny if it was the Happy Fun Ball?

02:39:32.524 --> 02:39:34.307
But that couldn't have been.
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

02:39:34.307 --> 02:39:36.094
LAURA: That was 10 years.

02:39:36.094 --> 02:39:37.974
TALIESIN: Well, a lot can happen.

02:39:37.974 --> 02:39:40.394
MARISHA: But I feel like Twiggy was sooner.

02:39:40.394 --> 02:39:42.424
TRAVIS: And the Happy Fun Ball,

02:39:42.424 --> 02:39:44.906
would you describe it as a weapon?
MARISHA: Is it a weapon?

02:39:44.906 --> 02:39:46.624
LAURA: Could be.
MARISHA: An artifact.

02:39:46.624 --> 02:39:47.604
But that's a weapon!

02:39:47.604 --> 02:39:49.794
And I point to the bo staff on the ground

02:39:49.794 --> 02:39:51.424
that Caleb is identifying.

02:39:51.424 --> 02:39:52.444
SAM: Oh, yeah.

02:39:52.444 --> 02:39:53.504
TRAVIS: What, that stick?

02:39:53.504 --> 02:39:55.554
MARISHA: Yeah, it's super fucking magical.

02:39:56.664 --> 02:39:58.244
At least that's what Caleb said.

02:39:58.244 --> 02:39:59.077
TRAVIS: The stick is?

02:39:59.077 --> 02:40:00.504
MARISHA: That bo staff,

02:40:00.504 --> 02:40:03.314
that I definitely--
LAURA: Yeah, it's got runes on it,

02:40:03.314 --> 02:40:05.144
it looks magical.
MARISHA: It's all gold and silver.

02:40:05.144 --> 02:40:06.864
Look at it. It's a sexy-looking staff.

02:40:06.864 --> 02:40:08.904
LAURA: You should definitely use it, Beau.
LIAM: Why don't you poke

02:40:08.904 --> 02:40:10.504
Fjord with it and see what happens?

02:40:10.504 --> 02:40:12.104
TRAVIS: Yeah, poke me with your stick.

02:40:13.394 --> 02:40:14.624
MARISHA: Really?

02:40:14.624 --> 02:40:16.234
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: Wait.

02:40:16.234 --> 02:40:17.924
TRAVIS: Well, it's all right, I've got medium amour.

02:40:17.924 --> 02:40:20.619
I'm sure this will be real bad.

02:40:23.698 --> 02:40:27.284
MARISHA: Fumph! And I spend a charge.

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:28.664
MATT: Okay.

02:40:28.664 --> 02:40:30.064
MARISHA: Or at least, I think I do.

02:40:31.164 --> 02:40:31.997
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Oh no.

02:40:31.997 --> 02:40:32.930
MARISHA: I swing it real hard.

02:40:32.930 --> 02:40:34.034
MATT: Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:40:34.034 --> 02:40:35.254
MATT: If I could have you to--

02:40:35.254 --> 02:40:37.804
can you roll a strength saving throw for me?

02:40:37.804 --> 02:40:40.484
TRAVIS: Are you sure you don't want a different category?

02:40:40.484 --> 02:40:42.094
MATT: She's standing about 30 feet away from you

02:40:42.094 --> 02:40:44.704
when she does this by the way.
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

02:40:44.704 --> 02:40:46.714
LIAM: Standing next to Fjord?

02:40:46.714 --> 02:40:49.084
TRAVIS: That is a nine.

02:40:49.084 --> 02:40:50.924
MATT: Go ahead and roll 3d8, if you don't mind.

02:40:50.924 --> 02:40:53.163
LAURA: Ooh.
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:40:53.163 --> 02:40:56.231
SAM: (impact sound)
MARISHA: 3d8?

02:40:56.231 --> 02:40:58.527
(laughs) 16.

02:40:58.527 --> 02:41:00.954
MATT: So you watch as Beau takes a few steps back

02:41:00.954 --> 02:41:02.014
and you're confused for a second

02:41:02.014 --> 02:41:04.397
why she's stepping away from you.

02:41:04.397 --> 02:41:06.095
(whooshes, humming impact)

02:41:06.095 --> 02:41:10.860
Does this one swing and you watch as the wind seems to

02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:13.614
(slurps) gather, and then this wave

02:41:13.614 --> 02:41:17.654
of pure crackling force energy just whoosh!

02:41:17.654 --> 02:41:20.514
Like a giant sickle, just carves through the air,

02:41:20.514 --> 02:41:23.674
30 feet out towards you and impacts,

02:41:23.674 --> 02:41:27.344
knocks the wind out of you and pushes you 15 feet back.

02:41:27.344 --> 02:41:29.539
LIAM: Right out of the dome.

02:41:29.539 --> 02:41:31.314
TRAVIS: I start making all the sounds that woman did

02:41:31.314 --> 02:41:33.442
when she fell out of the grape crushing pit.

02:41:33.442 --> 02:41:38.437
MARISHA: Ew! Ow ew, ugh!
TRAVIS: Ow! Stop! Ow! Ow!

02:41:38.437 --> 02:41:39.270
SAM: Ow!

02:41:40.764 --> 02:41:42.434
MATT: It-- all this dust, oomph,

02:41:42.434 --> 02:41:44.684
kicks up around it, eventually settles

02:41:44.684 --> 02:41:46.625
and you have--
TRAVIS: (coughs painfully)

02:41:46.625 --> 02:41:48.748
LAURA: Subtle. That was--

02:41:48.748 --> 02:41:50.414
TRAVIS: (groans)
ASHLEY: Wow!

02:41:50.414 --> 02:41:51.955
TRAVIS: Big stick.

02:41:51.955 --> 02:41:53.279
Big stick hurt me.
MARISHA: I love you so much.

02:41:53.279 --> 02:41:55.937
I just hold it and I just pet it,

02:41:57.039 --> 02:41:59.074
(whispers) I'm never letting you go.

02:41:59.074 --> 02:42:01.924
TRAVIS: Oh, how many times could you do that in a day?

02:42:02.964 --> 02:42:05.365
MARISHA: My senses tell me roughly four.

02:42:05.365 --> 02:42:08.282
(laughter)

02:42:09.574 --> 02:42:11.554
TRAVIS: Oh, so 13 points of damage?

02:42:11.554 --> 02:42:13.896
MATT: Of force damage, yes.
TRAVIS: Got it, cool.

02:42:17.404 --> 02:42:19.754
TALIESIN: Is that on top of the plus two and plus two?

02:42:19.754 --> 02:42:23.254
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a side thing
aside from the plus two plus two.

02:42:23.254 --> 02:42:25.664
TRAVIS: Jester, can you help me out, please?

02:42:25.664 --> 02:42:28.174
LAURA: Oh, I don't have very many spells left.

02:42:28.174 --> 02:42:29.007
Let me see.

02:42:29.007 --> 02:42:31.734
TRAVIS: Oh, Caduceus, do you have any?

02:42:31.734 --> 02:42:33.624
LAURA: Oh, I can Healing Word you.

02:42:33.624 --> 02:42:36.456
TALIESIN: I can-- yeah, I can do something, yeah.

02:42:37.724 --> 02:42:39.314
TRAVIS: Just in case we're ambushed.

02:42:39.314 --> 02:42:40.384
TALIESIN: Let me see what I got.

02:42:40.384 --> 02:42:41.600
I got something.

02:42:42.504 --> 02:42:45.844
LAURA: 10 points of healing.

02:42:45.844 --> 02:42:46.864
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:42:46.864 --> 02:42:49.272
TALIESIN: And I'll give you another

02:42:52.822 --> 02:42:53.713
10 points as well.

02:42:53.713 --> 02:42:55.694
TRAVIS: You are beautiful people.

02:42:55.694 --> 02:42:58.744
ASHLEY: Nott, did you find Skingorger?

02:42:58.744 --> 02:43:00.584
SAM: Oh, yes.

02:43:00.584 --> 02:43:03.304
I've been holding it in my pocket.

02:43:03.304 --> 02:43:07.074
I'm three feet tall--
(laughter)

02:43:07.074 --> 02:43:10.332
SAM: -- and I've been carrying your six-foot long sword

02:43:10.332 --> 02:43:11.524
just back here.

02:43:11.524 --> 02:43:13.264
MARISHA: Video game pocket, yeah.

02:43:13.264 --> 02:43:15.378
SAM: This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

02:43:15.378 --> 02:43:17.442
LIAM: ♪ (Zelda item-getting music) ♪

02:43:17.442 --> 02:43:20.408
SAM: You didn't see it before, but it was there.

02:43:21.744 --> 02:43:23.664
MATT: That awkward anime hero character who's

02:43:23.664 --> 02:43:25.714
wielding a sword four times their size.

02:43:25.714 --> 02:43:26.849
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:43:26.849 --> 02:43:29.034
LIAM: And when you walk in the door,
it's like a ladder at the door. Boom!

02:43:29.034 --> 02:43:31.600
TRAVIS: Wrist of 400 tensile strength.

02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:32.505
MATT: Yep.

02:43:32.505 --> 02:43:34.614
SAM: Yes, there's Skingorger.

02:43:34.614 --> 02:43:37.364
TALIESIN: Weird thought, but I
think Veth should get the boots.

02:43:38.444 --> 02:43:39.927
SAM: The boots?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:43:41.357 --> 02:43:43.244
I think you're the one who needs to get away from stuff

02:43:43.244 --> 02:43:45.054
and if things get too close.

02:43:45.054 --> 02:43:46.294
MARISHA: Either-- yeah,

02:43:46.294 --> 02:43:49.884
or one of the spell casters or the clerics.

02:43:49.884 --> 02:43:54.484
LIAM: And I was thinking, unless anyone wants them,

02:43:55.394 --> 02:43:59.634
I am still the weakest link in the group in some senses,

02:43:59.634 --> 02:44:02.244
so it would be helpful to get back.

02:44:02.244 --> 02:44:03.077
LAURA: So you want the boots

02:44:03.077 --> 02:44:04.074
and the coat?
MARISHA: Taking the boots?

02:44:04.074 --> 02:44:05.604
LIAM: I do not want the coat.

02:44:05.604 --> 02:44:07.297
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Oh.
LIAM: Not really my style.

02:44:08.654 --> 02:44:12.554
MARISHA: Does anyone else want this awesome bo staff?

02:44:12.554 --> 02:44:14.372
Will either of you--
SAM: I think it will definitely

02:44:14.372 --> 02:44:16.234
go well with Fjord.
MARISHA: Anyone?

02:44:16.234 --> 02:44:18.584
Yeah, I just don't know who else is proficient

02:44:18.584 --> 02:44:20.004
in a bo staff.

02:44:20.004 --> 02:44:21.854
LAURA: I think, it's only for you.
LIAM: It's got your name on it, Beau.

02:44:21.854 --> 02:44:22.687
MARISHA: Okay.

02:44:22.687 --> 02:44:25.671
ASHLEY: I think that's made for you.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:44:26.654 --> 02:44:27.794
TALIESIN: It's only light armor, right?

02:44:27.794 --> 02:44:30.014
LAURA: I don't think I can wear the coat

02:44:30.014 --> 02:44:32.894
because it has to go over light armor.

02:44:32.894 --> 02:44:34.374
I don't wear light armor.

02:44:34.374 --> 02:44:36.384
TALIESIN: Who wears light armor?
SAM: I do.

02:44:36.384 --> 02:44:38.564
LIAM: It can go over medium armor.

02:44:38.564 --> 02:44:39.484
TRAVIS: It can go over medium?

02:44:39.484 --> 02:44:41.404
LIAM: It can go over medium armor.

02:44:41.404 --> 02:44:43.931
SAM: Oh, wait, it can?
LIAM: That's what it says.

02:44:44.917 --> 02:44:47.192
LAURA: No, it says light armor.

02:44:47.192 --> 02:44:50.134
LIAM: Oh no, my armor is medium. I got in reverse.

02:44:50.134 --> 02:44:52.607
TALIESIN: Who has no armor?
SAM: I have light.

02:44:52.607 --> 02:44:54.474
LAURA: So, Veth can wear the--
ASHLEY: I have light, too.

02:44:54.474 --> 02:44:55.344
Oh, oh!

02:44:55.344 --> 02:44:56.674
SAM: Yeah.

02:44:56.674 --> 02:44:58.794
LAURA: I love the idea of Yasha in a--

02:44:58.794 --> 02:45:01.044
SAM: In a coat?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:45:01.044 --> 02:45:02.114
In, like, a nobleman's coat.

02:45:02.114 --> 02:45:04.056
That's actually kind of cool.
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's actually kind of nice.

02:45:04.056 --> 02:45:05.714
LAURA: Maybe we can cut some holes in the back of it,

02:45:05.714 --> 02:45:08.064
so your wings can pop through it.

02:45:08.064 --> 02:45:11.032
TRAVIS: Those are awesome. Oh, jeez.
LIAM: Lafayette!

02:45:11.032 --> 02:45:12.584
TRAVIS: The boots are dope.

02:45:12.584 --> 02:45:13.417
TALIESIN: Actually, that would--

02:45:13.417 --> 02:45:15.084
and especially since you're--
ASHLEY: I mean--

02:45:16.339 --> 02:45:17.172
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:45:17.172 --> 02:45:19.044
SAM: What's your AC?
ASHLEY: Let me give this a look.

02:45:19.044 --> 02:45:22.434
SAM: Do you have-- it's an attuned thing, yes?

02:45:22.434 --> 02:45:25.064
LIAM: The coat is, yeah.
LAURA: That's kind of cool.

02:45:25.064 --> 02:45:27.824
TALIESIN: And you're kind of down, you know.

02:45:27.824 --> 02:45:30.754
Make you harder to hit.
ASHLEY: It's a plus one bonus to AC,

02:45:30.754 --> 02:45:32.822
which would make me 18, but--

02:45:34.617 --> 02:45:36.651
MATT: I think your armor might be medium.

02:45:39.374 --> 02:45:40.744
ASHLEY: Oh, because I have the breastplate.

02:45:40.744 --> 02:45:41.794
MATT: With the breastplate.

02:45:41.794 --> 02:45:44.024
You still have that-- did you ever pick up--

02:45:44.024 --> 02:45:46.384
I'm trying to remember-- the bracers of defense?

02:45:46.384 --> 02:45:47.724
ASHLEY: I don't think...

02:45:47.724 --> 02:45:50.824
LAURA: We never got those.
MARISHA: No, we never went back. No--

02:45:50.824 --> 02:45:52.694
Or did you get them but-- you have them

02:45:52.694 --> 02:45:54.264
but you didn't equip them.
ASHLEY: I <i>have</i> them.

02:45:54.264 --> 02:45:55.544
MATT: I was like, I'm pretty sure you have those.

02:45:55.544 --> 02:45:58.544
LAURA: Oh my gosh, you had them all this time?

02:45:58.544 --> 02:46:01.024
MARISHA: But she can't use them.

02:46:01.024 --> 02:46:02.704
LAURA: Why?
MATT: She can use them

02:46:02.704 --> 02:46:04.954
but she can't use them with the breastplate.

02:46:04.954 --> 02:46:06.196
LAURA: Oh.

02:46:06.196 --> 02:46:09.112
So you could take off the breastplate,
put on your light armor,

02:46:09.112 --> 02:46:11.120
wear the bracers and wear the coat.

02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:13.024
TALIESIN: Oh, wow!

02:46:13.024 --> 02:46:17.254
SAM: Well would that increase
her AC or just keep it the same?

02:46:17.254 --> 02:46:18.984
LAURA: Well, even if it kept it the same,

02:46:18.984 --> 02:46:21.124
then she would have the bonus of the coat.

02:46:21.124 --> 02:46:23.074
SAM: What's the bonus of the coat?

02:46:23.074 --> 02:46:24.214
LAURA: I don't know what the bonus of the coat is.

02:46:24.214 --> 02:46:27.264
MARISHA: He dropped it in the thread.
SAM: Oh, that's right.

02:46:27.264 --> 02:46:28.794
LIAM: "As a reaction, you can gain

02:46:28.794 --> 02:46:31.362
"resistance to damage from a triggering attack."

02:46:31.362 --> 02:46:33.714
TRAVIS: It's also an excellent bargaining tool for later.

02:46:33.714 --> 02:46:35.924
It's rare, I would assume.

02:46:36.784 --> 02:46:37.924
LIAM: Wondrous even.

02:46:37.924 --> 02:46:40.434
TRAVIS: Wondrous, well.

02:46:40.434 --> 02:46:43.694
TALIESIN: Wow, that means magic damage,
you would be able to have resistance to.

02:46:43.694 --> 02:46:46.534
MARISHA: You can reach your reaction to gain resistance--

02:46:46.534 --> 02:46:49.234
ASHLEY: Could that work against--?
TALIESIN: Anything.

02:46:49.234 --> 02:46:53.242
ASHLEY: Being mind controlled, stuff like that?
TALIESIN: No.

02:46:53.242 --> 02:46:56.217
MARISHA: But psychic damage, right?

02:46:56.217 --> 02:46:58.754
LAURA: Yeah, but, like, mind controlled, not so much.

02:46:58.754 --> 02:47:01.114
LIAM: Not status a effect, but damages.

02:47:01.114 --> 02:47:03.820
ASHLEY: Let's put a pin in it.
Let me think about it.

02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:05.087
Because I do just want--

02:47:05.087 --> 02:47:07.774
LAURA: Either Veth or Yasha should have the coat.

02:47:07.774 --> 02:47:09.041
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: You got dibs.

02:47:09.041 --> 02:47:10.958
TALIESIN: You should probably get the boots.

02:47:10.958 --> 02:47:12.974
ASHLEY: I do love the breastplate, though.

02:47:12.974 --> 02:47:15.332
Let's think about it.
I'm going to think about this.

02:47:15.332 --> 02:47:17.684
MATT: You can think on it,
there's no rush for it now.

02:47:18.735 --> 02:47:20.184
But you do take a short rest,

02:47:20.184 --> 02:47:21.644
if you guys would like to

02:47:21.644 --> 02:47:24.678
to spend your hit dice to heal up a bit.

02:47:29.724 --> 02:47:33.740
If you'd like to, if you have anything else
you want to do in the time being,

02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:35.534
otherwise we can go into the evening

02:47:35.534 --> 02:47:37.894
as the village begins to gather.

02:47:37.894 --> 02:47:41.974
LIAM: Was there any jade or pearls in the bag-o-gems?

02:47:41.974 --> 02:47:43.341
LAURA: Oh, let me look.

02:47:45.044 --> 02:47:47.643
Oh hold on, I have a good prop.

02:47:47.643 --> 02:47:49.034
MATT: There you go.

02:47:49.034 --> 02:47:50.134
Good job.

02:47:50.134 --> 02:47:51.604
Yeah, there's a number of pearls there.

02:47:51.604 --> 02:47:53.004
Maybe about--
LAURA: Yeah, there's some pearls in here.

02:47:53.004 --> 02:47:56.415
MATT: -- 230 gold worth of pearls.
LIAM: Okay.

02:47:56.415 --> 02:47:58.032
LAURA: Do you want them?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:47:58.032 --> 02:47:59.464
LAURA: Is there any jade?

02:48:00.644 --> 02:48:03.484
MATT: There's a little bit
of jade, about 80 gold worth.

02:48:03.484 --> 02:48:05.594
LAURA: There's, like, 80 gold worth.
TALIESIN: Any diamond?

02:48:05.594 --> 02:48:08.052
LIAM: I can use all of that to
great effect if you can spare it.

02:48:08.052 --> 02:48:10.374
TRAVIS: Just the three, right?
MARISHA: The three diamonds?

02:48:10.374 --> 02:48:13.507
TALIESIN: Are there are there any
smaller diamonds in the bag, or no?

02:48:13.507 --> 02:48:15.692
MATT: No, just the three that she pulled.

02:48:15.692 --> 02:48:19.814
LAURA: 80 gold worth of jade and...

02:48:22.834 --> 02:48:23.667
LIAM: Okay.

02:48:26.134 --> 02:48:29.534
LAURA: And how much pearls worth of--?

02:48:29.534 --> 02:48:31.548
LIAM: 300, I think you said.
LAURA: -- did you say?

02:48:31.548 --> 02:48:34.356
MATT: It was 200 and...

02:48:34.356 --> 02:48:36.124
TRAVIS: 30?
MATT: I think it was 230.

02:48:36.124 --> 02:48:36.957
LAURA: Okay.

02:48:36.957 --> 02:48:38.684
MATT: I'm going with that
even if it wasn't. 230.

02:48:39.614 --> 02:48:40.682
SAM: We're rich.

02:48:42.014 --> 02:48:43.444
We can buy anything we want.

02:48:43.444 --> 02:48:45.714
TRAVIS: Certainly feels that way.
MARISHA: Feels good.

02:48:45.714 --> 02:48:46.554
SAM: Yeah.

02:48:46.554 --> 02:48:48.824
MARISHA: We've been poor for so long.

02:48:48.824 --> 02:48:50.847
SAM: Well, have we?

02:48:50.847 --> 02:48:53.194
MARISHA: I spent all my money
on these fucking bracers,

02:48:53.194 --> 02:48:55.581
so I've been very poor for a very long time.

02:48:55.581 --> 02:48:57.654
SAM: I've had literally thousands of gold.

02:48:57.654 --> 02:49:00.294
MARISHA: Wow, that's--
Don't brag about that.

02:49:00.294 --> 02:49:01.234
ASHLEY: I have not.

02:49:01.234 --> 02:49:05.751
TRAVIS: Hey, DM, remind us who
gave us the map to Rumblecusp?

02:49:08.704 --> 02:49:10.014
SAM: I don't think there was an actual map.

02:49:10.014 --> 02:49:11.434
MATT: There wasn't a physical map.

02:49:11.434 --> 02:49:14.554
I was just giving it to you so you have a visual aid.

02:49:14.554 --> 02:49:15.784
TRAVIS: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

02:49:15.784 --> 02:49:17.642
There are these clearings and...

02:49:18.483 --> 02:49:19.641
I don't know.

02:49:20.542 --> 02:49:22.229
There are clearings on the island like the one

02:49:22.229 --> 02:49:25.087
that was the tower was in, but...

02:49:25.087 --> 02:49:27.296
could just be topography.

02:49:29.074 --> 02:49:30.932
MATT: We'll say those were...

02:49:32.007 --> 02:49:33.884
creative license by the cartographer.

02:49:33.884 --> 02:49:34.717
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

02:49:35.924 --> 02:49:38.132
I'm reading into everything.
MATT: I know, I know.

02:49:40.524 --> 02:49:41.504
MARISHA: Okay.

02:49:41.504 --> 02:49:43.214
SAM: Well, it's night time, I guess.

02:49:43.214 --> 02:49:44.864
We're going to go to this gathering.

02:49:44.864 --> 02:49:47.874
LAURA: I mean, did Vilya call the gathering together?

02:49:47.874 --> 02:49:49.574
SAM: I think she did.

02:49:49.574 --> 02:49:50.934
MATT: She went out to begin to do so.

02:49:50.934 --> 02:49:52.524
LAURA: Okay.

02:49:52.524 --> 02:49:53.961
SAM: Do we have anything that we want

02:49:53.961 --> 02:49:57.374
to influence the villagers

02:49:57.374 --> 02:50:00.134
to do or not do?

02:50:00.134 --> 02:50:01.774
We're just going to let them say their piece

02:50:01.774 --> 02:50:03.244
and the ones who want to leave,

02:50:03.244 --> 02:50:04.934
we'll help them with boats or no,

02:50:04.934 --> 02:50:06.542
we're not going to offer our boats?

02:50:06.542 --> 02:50:08.784
TRAVIS: I wouldn't inform them.

02:50:08.784 --> 02:50:10.994
I would control the flow of information, first of all,

02:50:10.994 --> 02:50:13.894
and second, I would encourage them to keep sort of

02:50:13.894 --> 02:50:16.964
the same status that they had before that was working.

02:50:16.964 --> 02:50:19.164
Until we figure out how many people coming in,

02:50:19.164 --> 02:50:21.754
who wants to leave and where they want to go,

02:50:21.754 --> 02:50:24.711
we should try and remain, like, the same homeostasis

02:50:24.711 --> 02:50:26.264
as before this.

02:50:27.254 --> 02:50:28.464
Because then it's going to be up to Vilya

02:50:28.464 --> 02:50:30.984
to figure out how many people she can take to where

02:50:30.984 --> 02:50:32.334
and how often.

02:50:32.334 --> 02:50:35.424
TALIESIN: It's also going to be an--
this is an important thought--

02:50:35.424 --> 02:50:38.054
I don't think anyone should do anything rash.

02:50:38.054 --> 02:50:40.684
Take a couple days, figure out what they want.

02:50:40.684 --> 02:50:42.334
TRAVIS: I know they'll be urgent to go.

02:50:43.214 --> 02:50:45.374
Families and other things waiting,

02:50:45.374 --> 02:50:48.637
but we also don't want anything to happen to Vilya.

02:50:49.474 --> 02:50:52.652
She is pretty valuable.

02:50:53.614 --> 02:50:56.154
TALIESIN: Can't we teleport people as well?

02:50:57.064 --> 02:50:58.464
If we've been there before.

02:51:00.554 --> 02:51:02.854
LIAM: If there is a circle that we have used,

02:51:02.854 --> 02:51:04.164
and I'm familiar with.

02:51:04.164 --> 02:51:06.424
TRAVIS: In the Empire or--?

02:51:06.424 --> 02:51:09.515
LIAM: I can take us to Rosohna,
I can take us to Nicodranas.

02:51:09.515 --> 02:51:12.257
I can take us to Zadash.

02:51:14.129 --> 02:51:17.777
MATT: You could send them back to Port Damali.
LAURA: And to Port-- yeah. That's good.

02:51:17.777 --> 02:51:19.829
TALIESIN: Can you send people without leaving?

02:51:21.334 --> 02:51:24.355
LIAM: Yeah, although they might have
some explaining to do when they arrive.

02:51:24.355 --> 02:51:25.774
MATT: Yes, they would.

02:51:25.774 --> 02:51:27.789
MARISHA: We would have to alert people. Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:51:27.789 --> 02:51:31.254
TALIESIN: But-- wouldn't necessarily have to say anything,

02:51:31.254 --> 02:51:34.206
but we can say that we will help people get

02:51:34.206 --> 02:51:35.604
to where they need to go.

02:51:35.604 --> 02:51:37.574
LAURA: It would be nice if we could give everybody,

02:51:37.574 --> 02:51:39.714
like, a little bit of gold on the way through,

02:51:39.714 --> 02:51:41.231
so that, you know.

02:51:42.394 --> 02:51:44.334
LIAM: Like a trick-or-treat basket
as they they're walking by.

02:51:44.334 --> 02:51:47.942
LAURA: Yeah, here's your gift bags.
TALIESIN: A gift bag, everyone loves a gift bag.

02:51:47.942 --> 02:51:49.504
LAURA: Hope you enjoyed your time on Vo.

02:51:49.504 --> 02:51:51.494
LIAM: Just take one please, thank you.

02:51:51.494 --> 02:51:53.944
TRAVIS: So much was destroyed under the volcano

02:51:53.944 --> 02:51:56.853
but we were able to salvage this.

02:51:56.853 --> 02:51:58.144
LAURA: Yeah.

02:51:58.144 --> 02:52:00.494
MARISHA: I mean, for a lot of people,

02:52:00.494 --> 02:52:02.844
a bag of 50 gold can go a long way.

02:52:02.844 --> 02:52:04.284
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:52:04.284 --> 02:52:05.977
As for us.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:52:07.234 --> 02:52:11.124
ASHLEY: Yeah, I didn't put my my coin in yet, just in case.

02:52:11.124 --> 02:52:12.745
TRAVIS: Same.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:52:15.044 --> 02:52:16.524
SAM: Well, okay.

02:52:16.524 --> 02:52:19.087
TRAVIS: An eventful day

02:52:19.087 --> 02:52:20.114
or three.

02:52:20.114 --> 02:52:21.414
How many days has it been?

02:52:21.414 --> 02:52:22.247
SAM: Three, I think.

02:52:22.247 --> 02:52:24.324
MATT: Three, a little over three days, yeah.

02:52:24.324 --> 02:52:25.737
LAURA: Fuck.

02:52:25.737 --> 02:52:27.734
TALIESIN: A lot can happen in three days.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:52:27.734 --> 02:52:29.784
LAURA: I'm exhausted.

02:52:29.784 --> 02:52:31.144
TRAVIS: The dome <i>and</i> shifts?

02:52:33.534 --> 02:52:36.304
SAM: Well, no, there's the gathering first before bed.

02:52:36.304 --> 02:52:38.014
TRAVIS: Oh, it's tonight.

02:52:38.014 --> 02:52:40.614
MATT: You're still, like, midday
at this point, that's what I'm saying--

02:52:40.614 --> 02:52:43.423
SAM: Why don't you go to sleep, Fjord?
It's one in the afternoon.

02:52:43.423 --> 02:52:45.481
TRAVIS: I'm going to take a power nap.
MARISHA: I'm so exhausted.

02:52:45.481 --> 02:52:46.374
MATT: You guys you guys did wake up

02:52:46.374 --> 02:52:48.174
at the crack of dawn to go fight Vokodo,

02:52:48.174 --> 02:52:49.884
so, like, your day shifted a little bit earlier

02:52:49.884 --> 02:52:51.504
than you're used to.
TRAVIS: I'm a little hyperglycemic,

02:52:51.504 --> 02:52:53.164
I need to get some--

02:52:53.164 --> 02:52:55.239
SAM: We <i>just</i> ate lunch.

02:52:56.274 --> 02:52:57.834
TRAVIS: It's that post-lunch crash.

02:52:57.834 --> 02:53:00.084
TALIESIN: Yeah, I might take a walk around while--

02:53:00.084 --> 02:53:01.874
this is-- I feel like being cooped up is--

02:53:01.874 --> 02:53:03.334
I want to get a sense of things.

02:53:03.334 --> 02:53:05.524
LAURA: Be careful, Caduceus.
MATT: Okay.

02:53:05.524 --> 02:53:07.074
TALIESIN: If anyone wants to come or otherwise.

02:53:07.074 --> 02:53:09.569
LAURA: I'll come with you.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:53:09.569 --> 02:53:11.494
Two clerics never goes wrong.
MATT: Yeah.

02:53:11.494 --> 02:53:13.614
LAURA: It never has before.
TALIESIN: No.

02:53:13.614 --> 02:53:16.364
MATT: As the time begins to
grow closer to the end of the day,

02:53:16.364 --> 02:53:17.694
you can see people are now preparing,

02:53:17.694 --> 02:53:20.894
they're bringing all the seating arrangements

02:53:20.894 --> 02:53:22.924
and familiar things you saw

02:53:22.924 --> 02:53:26.034
brought to that one social evening with the bonfire.

02:53:26.034 --> 02:53:28.354
The fire is being constructed, but it's going to be smaller

02:53:28.354 --> 02:53:30.354
and there's less people helping.

02:53:30.354 --> 02:53:32.124
But it looks like it is happening.

02:53:32.124 --> 02:53:35.584
You can see Vilya has been doing the rounds

02:53:35.584 --> 02:53:38.654
of trying to convince and gather as many people as she can.

02:53:40.062 --> 02:53:41.254
What is it you guys are looking to do

02:53:41.254 --> 02:53:42.374
while you're out and about?

02:53:42.374 --> 02:53:43.684
LAURA: What do you want to do?

02:53:46.524 --> 02:53:48.494
TALIESIN: Just trying to get a sense of--

02:53:48.494 --> 02:53:50.254
if there's anybody who's nervous.

02:53:50.254 --> 02:53:52.524
If there's anybody-- how people are sitting,

02:53:52.524 --> 02:53:56.567
if they're starting to come out of their initial panic.

02:53:56.567 --> 02:53:58.624
If there's anyone who looks dangerous.

02:53:58.624 --> 02:54:00.914
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Or worried.

02:54:00.914 --> 02:54:03.414
MATT: Many people look worried.

02:54:03.414 --> 02:54:05.604
Most people look worried.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:54:05.604 --> 02:54:07.814
There's worried and then there's <i>worried</i>, though.

02:54:07.814 --> 02:54:08.647
MATT: There is.

02:54:10.524 --> 02:54:13.264
It seems-- I would say, a majority of people

02:54:13.264 --> 02:54:16.704
are just shaken and trying to piece together

02:54:16.704 --> 02:54:18.414
what their future looks like,

02:54:18.414 --> 02:54:19.844
from two different lives that have collided

02:54:19.844 --> 02:54:20.914
depending on how long they've been here.

02:54:20.914 --> 02:54:21.964
Some people are shorter than others,

02:54:21.964 --> 02:54:25.167
some people longer, some people their whole life.

02:54:26.154 --> 02:54:29.113
TALIESIN: I'm going to help set up a bit, then.

02:54:30.917 --> 02:54:33.104
MATT: Imagine for the people that have been here

02:54:33.104 --> 02:54:38.104
their whole life, majority of their community,

02:54:38.264 --> 02:54:40.414
is uprooting.

02:54:40.414 --> 02:54:42.094
So this is a very traumatic event

02:54:42.094 --> 02:54:44.304
for some people here as well.

02:54:44.304 --> 02:54:47.394
But you do notice as people begin to gather as well,

02:54:50.254 --> 02:54:54.634
Anola, the older woman who cooked with you

02:54:54.634 --> 02:54:56.494
the night before, you can see,

02:54:56.494 --> 02:54:58.594
has already stepped into a matronly role

02:54:58.594 --> 02:55:01.584
and has begun to talk with

02:55:01.584 --> 02:55:06.012
and begin to have a small forum

02:55:06.012 --> 02:55:10.444
of villagers to discuss through their processes.

02:55:10.444 --> 02:55:11.714
So, like, there are pockets,

02:55:11.714 --> 02:55:14.274
you can see, where the community is still a community.

02:55:14.274 --> 02:55:17.694
And people are starting to rise to the occasion

02:55:17.694 --> 02:55:21.574
of a fractured whole.

02:55:21.574 --> 02:55:23.904
And it does give you a sense of hope.

02:55:23.904 --> 02:55:25.244
There are some that are not engaging at all

02:55:25.244 --> 02:55:28.204
and there are people that are just packing up their things.

02:55:28.204 --> 02:55:30.054
You're not sure what they plan to do.

02:55:31.534 --> 02:55:33.014
Upon asking around a little bit,

02:55:33.014 --> 02:55:36.304
you do hear people talking about that Vilya has mentioned

02:55:36.304 --> 02:55:38.474
that there are ways to escape

02:55:38.474 --> 02:55:41.044
and there are people that are eager to get off immediately.

02:55:41.044 --> 02:55:42.734
There are people that are waiting

02:55:42.734 --> 02:55:44.874
to see how it plays out.

02:55:44.874 --> 02:55:47.074
But there is-- there's a mixture of

02:55:48.024 --> 02:55:49.954
"how do we hold on to what we had?"

02:55:49.954 --> 02:55:52.694
and "how do I get as far away from this as possible?"

02:55:52.694 --> 02:55:54.286
and everything in between.

02:55:55.334 --> 02:55:56.844
As far as dangerous,

02:55:57.844 --> 02:55:59.254
I mean, it's hard to tell.

02:55:59.254 --> 02:56:01.341
In the middle of this energy, there
are some people that you can't tell

02:56:01.341 --> 02:56:05.694
if they're afraid or predatory.

02:56:05.694 --> 02:56:07.944
What you do know, and it does give you

02:56:07.944 --> 02:56:11.285
some semblance of comfort, is

02:56:11.285 --> 02:56:13.968
nobody here has wealth.

02:56:15.984 --> 02:56:18.754
So unless there is a personal reason

02:56:19.744 --> 02:56:22.877
to harm another that you're unaware of,

02:56:25.374 --> 02:56:30.374
there's not much to be gained by stealing from or, you know,

02:56:31.334 --> 02:56:34.734
abusing the trust of others that you are aware of.

02:56:34.734 --> 02:56:37.604
So there are shady individuals, of course.

02:56:37.604 --> 02:56:39.804
And the best you can read, and you can read pretty well,

02:56:39.804 --> 02:56:42.736
there's no immediate threat of danger

02:56:43.724 --> 02:56:45.274
at the moment.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:56:45.274 --> 02:56:48.834
I'm going to just help set up a bit.

02:56:48.834 --> 02:56:50.674
Just listen to people try and get a sense

02:56:50.674 --> 02:56:52.264
of what their plans are, what they're thinking

02:56:52.264 --> 02:56:54.157
and just help cook, help--

02:56:55.044 --> 02:56:59.464
LAURA: I'm going to look for the
family that moved out of the hut

02:56:59.464 --> 02:57:01.054
that first day that we came in.

02:57:01.054 --> 02:57:03.464
MATT: Yes, Doron.
LAURA: Yeah, do I see them?

02:57:03.464 --> 02:57:04.297
MATT: You do.

02:57:05.484 --> 02:57:07.374
You see him and his wife and their children

02:57:07.374 --> 02:57:10.394
and they're in the process of

02:57:10.394 --> 02:57:12.024
helping set up the bonfire

02:57:12.024 --> 02:57:14.974
and arranging the various stumps and seats,

02:57:14.974 --> 02:57:16.190
as you approach he goes,

02:57:16.190 --> 02:57:18.084
"Oh, hello there."

02:57:18.084 --> 02:57:19.134
LAURA: Hi.

02:57:19.134 --> 02:57:23.784
MATT: "So you all helped Viridi--

02:57:23.784 --> 02:57:27.792
"<i>Vilya</i> destroy Vo,

02:57:27.792 --> 02:57:29.114
"who apparently was not a god."

02:57:29.114 --> 02:57:30.407
LAURA: Not a god.

02:57:30.407 --> 02:57:31.647
Crazy, huh?
MATT: "That's crazy.

02:57:31.647 --> 02:57:33.954
"Gods are not being gods,

02:57:33.954 --> 02:57:36.153
"and things pretending to be something they're not,

02:57:36.153 --> 02:57:38.236
"that's crazy. That's wild.

02:57:41.674 --> 02:57:42.917
"Well, um..."

02:57:42.917 --> 02:57:45.133
LAURA: H-h-how are you guys?

02:57:47.338 --> 02:57:48.288
MATT: He goes,

02:57:50.344 --> 02:57:53.794
"Me and Alana here, we met a long time ago here

02:57:53.794 --> 02:57:57.164
"and we had different lives back home."

02:57:57.164 --> 02:57:59.914
"She's from Marquet,

02:57:59.914 --> 02:58:04.234
"I, myself, didn't have the best of a relationship

02:58:04.234 --> 02:58:06.816
"waiting for me back in Wildemount, but...

02:58:08.665 --> 02:58:10.322
"I think we're going to stay."

02:58:10.322 --> 02:58:11.264
LAURA: Oh, that's nice.

02:58:11.264 --> 02:58:13.214
MATT: "I think we're going to stay."

02:58:13.214 --> 02:58:15.222
LAURA: What's your real name?

02:58:17.234 --> 02:58:18.344
MATT: "Berex."

02:58:18.344 --> 02:58:19.534
LAURA: Berex.

02:58:19.534 --> 02:58:21.401
Does your last name begin with a "V"?

02:58:22.494 --> 02:58:23.494
MATT: "It does."

02:58:24.384 --> 02:58:25.324
LAURA: I had a feeling.

02:58:25.324 --> 02:58:27.457
MATT: "Berex Valen. How do you know this?"

02:58:28.414 --> 02:58:30.061
LAURA: Do I have the watch?

02:58:31.024 --> 02:58:33.890
MARISHA: Either you or I do. One of us was--

02:58:33.890 --> 02:58:35.722
LAURA: Because I had been going around asking every--

02:58:35.722 --> 02:58:38.488
MARISHA: I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:58:38.488 --> 02:58:40.454
We'll just you say you do.
MATT: We'll say you do.

02:58:40.454 --> 02:58:43.374
MARISHA: We didn't put it back,
I know we didn't put it back.

02:58:43.374 --> 02:58:44.656
LAURA: We found this.

02:58:46.164 --> 02:58:47.904
LIAM: Big Vandran.

02:58:47.904 --> 02:58:50.444
MATT: He looks at it.
(laughter)

02:58:50.444 --> 02:58:52.611
And opens it and looks at it wistfully.

02:58:55.469 --> 02:58:56.677
Looks at his wife.

02:58:58.172 --> 02:58:59.305
Closes it and goes,

02:59:00.304 --> 02:59:01.445
"You can keep it.

02:59:03.394 --> 02:59:05.723
"It's a reminder of a life that

02:59:05.723 --> 02:59:07.853
"I don't think is mine anymore.

02:59:09.511 --> 02:59:11.528
"But thank you, I appreciate the offer."

02:59:13.984 --> 02:59:16.834
LAURA: I'm happy you guys have each other in this.

02:59:18.324 --> 02:59:19.474
MATT: "Me too.

02:59:19.474 --> 02:59:20.604
"Me too.

02:59:20.604 --> 02:59:24.261
"This is complicated, but well,"

02:59:24.261 --> 02:59:25.469
and he put his arms up and says,

02:59:25.469 --> 02:59:27.444
"It's a beautiful place to live."

02:59:27.444 --> 02:59:28.964
LAURA: It is.

02:59:28.964 --> 02:59:30.124
It is.

02:59:30.124 --> 02:59:31.404
H-how would you guys feel if you know,

02:59:31.404 --> 02:59:32.954
a whole bunch of visitors came?

02:59:34.674 --> 02:59:36.277
MATT: "Right.

02:59:36.277 --> 02:59:39.934
"Viridi-- Vilya was mentioning something about that.

02:59:39.934 --> 02:59:43.254
"That you had a bunch of folks coming in for a bit,

02:59:43.254 --> 02:59:45.354
"for some sort of meeting."

02:59:45.354 --> 02:59:46.884
LAURA: Yeah.

02:59:46.884 --> 02:59:47.944
Yeah.

02:59:47.944 --> 02:59:48.777
A meeting.

02:59:48.777 --> 02:59:53.472
MATT: "Well, we're happy to help, you know,

02:59:54.534 --> 02:59:56.424
"best we can. You can vouch for these--?"

02:59:56.424 --> 02:59:58.594
LAURA: Oh my gosh, well, I don't know them personally.

02:59:58.594 --> 03:00:01.894
But, oh my gosh, you know, what would be really fun?

03:00:01.894 --> 03:00:02.727
MATT: "What?"

03:00:02.727 --> 03:00:05.474
LAURA: What if, you know,

03:00:05.474 --> 03:00:08.924
you and whoever else decided to stay here,

03:00:08.924 --> 03:00:10.382
like, could turn this place into

03:00:10.382 --> 03:00:13.016
like, a really awesome resort or something.

03:00:13.016 --> 03:00:14.566
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:00:14.566 --> 03:00:17.124
MATT: There's, like, this slow moment where like,

03:00:17.124 --> 03:00:19.711
him and his wife's eyes meet and the kids go,

03:00:20.934 --> 03:00:22.374
"What's a resort?"

03:00:22.374 --> 03:00:26.174
He's like, "Uh, we'll talk later.

03:00:26.174 --> 03:00:27.534
"How we do that?"

03:00:27.534 --> 03:00:29.174
LAURA: I mean, we just work

03:00:29.174 --> 03:00:31.824
on making the rooms look a little fancier, you know.

03:00:31.824 --> 03:00:33.624
Anybody that ends up leaving,

03:00:33.624 --> 03:00:37.234
we can turn into, like, a hotel room or something.

03:00:37.234 --> 03:00:38.344
MATT: "Okay, okay.

03:00:38.344 --> 03:00:39.874
"Yeah, I could probably do something like that, right?"

03:00:39.874 --> 03:00:42.294
She's like, "I think so."

03:00:42.294 --> 03:00:44.564
SAM: There's even a hot spring.
MARISHA: Yeah, absolutely.

03:00:44.564 --> 03:00:45.884
MATT: "How much time do we have?"

03:00:45.884 --> 03:00:48.064
LAURA: People will be getting here probably

03:00:48.064 --> 03:00:50.374
within the next few days, you know.

03:00:50.374 --> 03:00:52.724
The bulk of people in, like, seven days.

03:00:52.724 --> 03:00:54.504
We'll probably have some stragglers.

03:00:54.504 --> 03:00:56.377
A few people actually showed up today.

03:00:56.377 --> 03:00:57.510
(scoffs)

03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:59.034
MATT: They both look nervous

03:00:59.034 --> 03:01:00.584
and they both go, "All right,

03:01:00.584 --> 03:01:02.172
"well, you know what, we'll do what we can.

03:01:02.172 --> 03:01:04.481
"And we could probably get a few other
folks who are staying back to help.

03:01:04.481 --> 03:01:05.439
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:05.439 --> 03:01:07.374
MATT: "I'll get this place turned around."

03:01:07.374 --> 03:01:08.964
LAURA: This is exciting.

03:01:08.964 --> 03:01:09.914
MATT: "Sure."

03:01:09.914 --> 03:01:11.124
LAURA: I'll help.

03:01:11.124 --> 03:01:13.674
MATT: "Wonderful. Then yeah, okay."

03:01:13.674 --> 03:01:15.515
LAURA: Tomorrow. It's a long day today.

03:01:15.515 --> 03:01:16.984
MATT: "Right. Tensions are still a bit high."

03:01:16.984 --> 03:01:18.684
LAURA: Yeah, we'll wait to sort it all out.

03:01:18.684 --> 03:01:20.538
MATT: "Right. But yeah.

03:01:20.538 --> 03:01:22.274
"Come find us and we'll be happy to help."

03:01:22.274 --> 03:01:23.257
LAURA: Awesome.

03:01:25.204 --> 03:01:26.894
MATT: All right.

03:01:26.894 --> 03:01:28.244
Any other business?

03:01:29.084 --> 03:01:30.559
MARISHA: Airbnv.

03:01:31.518 --> 03:01:34.185
LIAM: Ah, man.
LAURA: (laughs) Stupid.

03:01:34.185 --> 03:01:35.161
TALIESIN: No, I'm pretty good.

03:01:35.161 --> 03:01:36.887
LIAM: Nah, it's good, it's good.

03:01:39.099 --> 03:01:41.684
I have a bit of business when the clerics are done.

03:01:41.684 --> 03:01:42.824
MATT: Yeah, are you guys done?

03:01:42.824 --> 03:01:43.914
TALIESIN: Mm-mm.
MATT: Okay.

03:01:43.914 --> 03:01:45.554
LIAM: I would say in that time that has elapsed--

03:01:45.554 --> 03:01:46.387
who all's in the dome?

03:01:46.387 --> 03:01:47.704
Is everyone else in the dome?

03:01:47.704 --> 03:01:49.274
MATT: Yeah, no one else has left yet.

03:01:49.274 --> 03:01:50.107
LIAM: No, I have to stay.

03:01:50.107 --> 03:01:51.424
Well, I don't make a big to-do,

03:01:51.424 --> 03:01:54.446
I just I take the time to make Frumpkin

03:01:55.434 --> 03:01:57.484
and look at-- no one's paying attention to me.

03:01:57.484 --> 03:02:00.264
At a certain point, I just look around at them all,

03:02:00.264 --> 03:02:02.974
look at the walls of the dome,

03:02:02.974 --> 03:02:05.557
and I bring Frumpkin and I-- come, sit here.

03:02:06.564 --> 03:02:08.534
And I grab a piece-- a chunk of wood

03:02:08.534 --> 03:02:10.417
that I picked up on the way in

03:02:11.474 --> 03:02:13.664
and set it on the ground,

03:02:13.664 --> 03:02:15.701
and take out that wand again.

03:02:17.474 --> 03:02:20.514
Look at the wood, look at the wand, look at Frumpkin

03:02:21.594 --> 03:02:24.394
and study Frumpkin,

03:02:25.604 --> 03:02:27.624
and keeping my eyes on Frumpkin,

03:02:27.624 --> 03:02:32.474
begin to wave my hands over this just solid block of wood

03:02:32.474 --> 03:02:34.974
and bits of the wood as I cast Fabricate,

03:02:35.854 --> 03:02:39.744
start to shear away and it probably takes a good

03:02:39.744 --> 03:02:43.804
five, 10, 15 minutes, but slowly start melting away

03:02:43.804 --> 03:02:46.684
parts of this block of wood,

03:02:46.684 --> 03:02:51.004
until I get a crude form of a cat.

03:02:51.004 --> 03:02:54.514
It's not highly detailed, but clearly a cat

03:02:54.514 --> 03:02:58.677
and looks cl-- don't move, I said. Hold still.

03:03:00.164 --> 03:03:00.997
And I finish it.

03:03:00.997 --> 03:03:03.142
It's about this-- just this big.

03:03:04.034 --> 03:03:06.784
And I set it down in front of the wand

03:03:06.784 --> 03:03:11.336
and also pull out some papers

03:03:12.404 --> 03:03:14.564
and then that row of a handful

03:03:14.564 --> 03:03:19.064
of small pieces of broken pieces of stained glass

03:03:19.064 --> 03:03:20.489
from the temple.

03:03:22.534 --> 03:03:26.434
And I spend another 15 or 20 minutes writing notes

03:03:26.434 --> 03:03:28.664
and occasionally looking at people

03:03:28.664 --> 03:03:31.094
who are not paying attention to me.

03:03:31.094 --> 03:03:32.644
MATT: Okay.

03:03:32.644 --> 03:03:36.804
LIAM: And pass that time, and in a little while

03:03:36.804 --> 03:03:40.129
I just gather it all up and I put it away.

03:03:40.129 --> 03:03:40.970
MATT: Okay.

03:03:40.970 --> 03:03:43.204
LIAM: And then I lie down because I am wrecked

03:03:43.204 --> 03:03:44.404
and get a bunch of hit dice back

03:03:44.404 --> 03:03:47.104
and I will use Arcane Recovery to pull back--

03:03:47.104 --> 03:03:49.917
MATT: You got it.
LIAM: -- a 6th-level spell slot.

03:03:49.917 --> 03:03:51.624
And that's it.

03:03:51.624 --> 03:03:52.514
MATT: Check with Arcane Recovery

03:03:52.514 --> 03:03:54.804
to see what the spell level limit is.

03:03:54.804 --> 03:03:56.914
LIAM: I think it's whatever is half-- I will.

03:03:56.914 --> 03:03:59.734
I think it's just half of my level, I can--

03:03:59.734 --> 03:04:02.434
half of my character level I can bring back

03:04:02.434 --> 03:04:04.484
in spell slots, but let me double check.

03:04:05.784 --> 03:04:07.614
MATT: There maybe a limit, but double check, yeah.

03:04:07.614 --> 03:04:08.880
LIAM: I'll pick different levels--
MATT: Might not be.

03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:10.939
I might be remembering something else.

03:04:10.939 --> 03:04:12.554
In the interim, the rest you guys get your short rest

03:04:12.554 --> 03:04:14.124
as you converse amongst yourselves

03:04:14.124 --> 03:04:16.344
from thinking over

03:04:16.344 --> 03:04:19.334
what's, you know-- what things are happening.

03:04:19.334 --> 03:04:21.200
What's in the future.

03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:23.864
MARISHA: I just do some journaling, write down my experience

03:04:23.864 --> 03:04:26.434
and reflect on the time here.

03:04:26.434 --> 03:04:28.924
LIAM: Oh, can't be-- you're right. It can't be sixth,

03:04:28.924 --> 03:04:30.884
so it's got to be fifth and below.
MATT: That's what I thought. It was fifth and--

03:04:30.884 --> 03:04:32.234
LIAM: Thank you.
MATT: No worries.

03:04:33.374 --> 03:04:37.234
Yeah, to ruminating on the battle that just transpired,

03:04:37.234 --> 03:04:39.594
the weirdness of the creature you encountered,

03:04:39.594 --> 03:04:43.334
and the future of the people in the time to come.

03:04:43.334 --> 03:04:45.744
SAM: I'll just go up to Vilya real quick and just--

03:04:45.744 --> 03:04:48.174
is she around or is she organizing?

03:04:48.174 --> 03:04:49.454
She's around.
MATT: She's not around you guys.

03:04:49.454 --> 03:04:50.734
She's out organizing for the night,

03:04:50.734 --> 03:04:52.144
but you can go find her.
SAM: Okay.

03:04:52.144 --> 03:04:54.502
No, I'll let her do her thing.
MATT: Okay.

03:04:55.344 --> 03:04:57.889
TRAVIS: I'll head over to Jester for a moment.

03:04:59.794 --> 03:05:04.779
Those first three arrivals for the Traveler Con,

03:05:06.104 --> 03:05:09.174
It's a pretty diverse handful.

03:05:09.174 --> 03:05:11.544
LAURA: Well, it's really, like, two arrivals.

03:05:11.544 --> 03:05:13.954
There's one really nice guy and one super bitch

03:05:13.954 --> 03:05:16.424
and she had a body guard.

03:05:16.424 --> 03:05:19.783
TRAVIS: Right. Yep, the super bitch was was an outlier.

03:05:19.783 --> 03:05:21.711
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Either way.

03:05:23.774 --> 03:05:26.699
So, I remember how distressed you were when we all--

03:05:26.699 --> 03:05:29.590
So, I remember how distressed you were when we all--

03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:31.464
when you realized that the Traveler knew

03:05:31.464 --> 03:05:33.264
that this place had the potential

03:05:33.264 --> 03:05:37.884
of wiping people's memories and that has been negated now.

03:05:38.754 --> 03:05:39.654
LAURA: Yeah.

03:05:39.654 --> 03:05:44.014
TRAVIS: So, that's off the table.

03:05:44.014 --> 03:05:47.174
And Traveler Con is moving forward.

03:05:47.174 --> 03:05:48.007
LAURA: Yeah.

03:05:48.007 --> 03:05:50.804
TRAVIS: But the Traveler doesn't want to be a god.

03:05:50.804 --> 03:05:51.637
LAURA: Right.

03:05:53.484 --> 03:05:56.774
So, we have to figure out a way

03:05:56.774 --> 03:05:59.094
to get everyone gathered

03:06:00.074 --> 03:06:03.754
and make it to where we make them believe

03:06:03.754 --> 03:06:05.084
that the Traveler,

03:06:06.264 --> 03:06:07.097
you know,

03:06:08.504 --> 03:06:11.064
has ascended basically.

03:06:11.064 --> 03:06:15.784
Like, become so powerful and so wonderful

03:06:15.784 --> 03:06:18.254
that he's going beyond the--

03:06:19.154 --> 03:06:23.014
what are the-- Divine Gates or something like that?

03:06:23.014 --> 03:06:25.714
And he won't be as available to us, you know,

03:06:25.714 --> 03:06:28.234
so that when people pray,

03:06:28.234 --> 03:06:30.146
he doesn't actually have to show up.

03:06:30.984 --> 03:06:32.484
But he can still be, you know,

03:06:34.114 --> 03:06:37.104
the Traveler and get, like, their praise and stuff.

03:06:37.104 --> 03:06:39.434
TRAVIS: That makes sense.

03:06:39.434 --> 03:06:41.634
I assume that all of these people that are coming, though,

03:06:41.634 --> 03:06:44.394
in some way have personally interacted with him,

03:06:44.394 --> 03:06:47.444
very similar to how you have, correct?

03:06:47.444 --> 03:06:49.164
LAURA: Probably in some way, yes.

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:51.234
Not quite as.
TRAVIS: Not as cool or long.

03:06:51.234 --> 03:06:52.067
LAURA: Right.

03:06:52.067 --> 03:06:54.324
Like, it doesn't mean as much to him.

03:06:54.324 --> 03:06:57.594
But, yeah, they probably have had--

03:06:57.594 --> 03:07:02.264
TRAVIS: So just stick with me for a moment gaming this out.

03:07:02.264 --> 03:07:04.414
If you all of a sudden tell all of them

03:07:04.414 --> 03:07:08.584
that that's gone, and let's say,

03:07:08.584 --> 03:07:09.974
some of them have been talking to him

03:07:09.974 --> 03:07:11.394
for half as long as you have,

03:07:11.394 --> 03:07:14.042
but still a significant part of their life.

03:07:15.134 --> 03:07:16.884
What if they're not happy?

03:07:20.944 --> 03:07:22.014
LAURA: Well...

03:07:22.014 --> 03:07:23.305
TRAVIS: And moreover,

03:07:24.454 --> 03:07:27.824
I did hear you say that you were, you know,

03:07:27.824 --> 03:07:30.281
sort of his rep.

03:07:31.524 --> 03:07:32.357
Which is true,

03:07:32.357 --> 03:07:34.374
you were the first for him.

03:07:34.374 --> 03:07:35.207
LAURA: Yeah.

03:07:36.754 --> 03:07:39.714
TRAVIS: My concern is that they would then be angry

03:07:39.714 --> 03:07:43.784
with not only him, but you.

03:07:46.014 --> 03:07:47.664
LAURA: Right.

03:07:47.664 --> 03:07:50.741
Well, then we kill them.

03:07:50.741 --> 03:07:52.594
No. (laughs)

03:07:54.283 --> 03:07:55.659
TRAVIS: And you know Beau. You just say the word,

03:07:55.659 --> 03:07:59.124
(clicks) she'll staff 200 people.

03:07:59.124 --> 03:08:00.465
LAURA: I mean,

03:08:02.644 --> 03:08:03.477
I don't know.

03:08:03.477 --> 03:08:06.574
Are you and Caduceus angry

03:08:06.574 --> 03:08:09.116
that the Wild Mother isn't, you know,

03:08:11.004 --> 03:08:14.331
next to you all the time having tea?

03:08:16.224 --> 03:08:19.751
Or is it what you expect out of a god?

03:08:19.751 --> 03:08:21.009
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

03:08:21.009 --> 03:08:25.594
Although my expectations are very low.

03:08:25.594 --> 03:08:30.594
I only speak with her when she decides.

03:08:31.084 --> 03:08:33.034
LAURA: Right.
TRAVIS: Never been able to connect.

03:08:33.034 --> 03:08:36.949
LAURA: How do you know it's actually her speaking to you?

03:08:39.544 --> 03:08:41.126
TRAVIS: I don't.

03:08:42.474 --> 03:08:44.444
LAURA: You just assume, right?

03:08:44.444 --> 03:08:46.182
Because it feels special?

03:08:47.144 --> 03:08:48.484
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:08:48.484 --> 03:08:52.024
LAURA: Well, maybe

03:08:52.024 --> 03:08:54.161
all these other people will then

03:08:56.154 --> 03:08:59.424
feel like the Traveler is still with them,

03:08:59.424 --> 03:09:00.694
is still talking to them,

03:09:00.694 --> 03:09:04.114
even if he's not actually doing it.

03:09:04.114 --> 03:09:07.064
You know, maybe the wind will blow their hair a certain way

03:09:07.064 --> 03:09:09.564
or a bird will poop on their shoulder

03:09:09.564 --> 03:09:12.074
and they'll think it's a sign that he is,

03:09:13.134 --> 03:09:15.252
you know, pranking them.

03:09:18.524 --> 03:09:19.999
TRAVIS: Let's hope for that.

03:09:21.194 --> 03:09:22.954
I hope for that.

03:09:22.954 --> 03:09:26.584
In the event that it doesn't go that way,

03:09:26.584 --> 03:09:28.004
let's just keep an open mind

03:09:28.004 --> 03:09:30.234
so that we can say we weren't surprised

03:09:30.234 --> 03:09:32.684
by something we hadn't thought of.

03:09:32.684 --> 03:09:33.925
Can we do that?

03:09:35.534 --> 03:09:36.984
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:36.984 --> 03:09:38.267
What if...

03:09:42.917 --> 03:09:44.867
Do you think it's mean?

03:09:46.944 --> 03:09:48.424
TRAVIS: Mean?

03:09:48.424 --> 03:09:51.066
LAURA: Well, like...

03:09:53.884 --> 03:09:55.174
I don't know.

03:09:55.174 --> 03:09:59.141
Do you think it's mean to keep people from actually having,

03:10:01.734 --> 03:10:03.942
like, a god who will listen to them?

03:10:05.634 --> 03:10:06.467
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:10:07.734 --> 03:10:08.567
Shit.

03:10:10.944 --> 03:10:12.994
I hadn't considered that.

03:10:12.994 --> 03:10:15.927
You mean someone that's really looking for a connection?

03:10:17.394 --> 03:10:20.484
LAURA: Or, like, what does the Wild Mother mean to you?

03:10:20.484 --> 03:10:23.524
Like, what does she actually do for you?

03:10:23.524 --> 03:10:28.522
Like, when you die, what does she give to you?

03:10:29.534 --> 03:10:31.054
Does she keep you safe?

03:10:31.054 --> 03:10:33.684
Do you pass into the afterlife?

03:10:33.684 --> 03:10:37.034
If she does, and somebody could be worshiping her

03:10:37.034 --> 03:10:40.154
and they could have a wonderful afterlife,

03:10:40.154 --> 03:10:42.524
and they accidentally worship the Traveler,

03:10:42.524 --> 03:10:44.954
and he doesn't do shit, and then they just die.

03:10:44.954 --> 03:10:46.195
And then what?

03:10:47.394 --> 03:10:51.074
TRAVIS: I actually don't know the answers

03:10:51.074 --> 03:10:53.644
to any of those questions.

03:10:53.644 --> 03:10:55.619
I hadn't really gotten that far.

03:10:56.904 --> 03:10:58.112
I just think,

03:10:59.464 --> 03:11:00.844
as well as we know you,

03:11:00.844 --> 03:11:03.524
the thing that you value so highly is friendship,

03:11:03.524 --> 03:11:05.184
and the trust and the camaraderie

03:11:05.184 --> 03:11:07.604
and the protection and the ear.

03:11:07.604 --> 03:11:09.224
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:09.224 --> 03:11:11.874
TRAVIS: If that was removed or reduced,

03:11:11.874 --> 03:11:14.494
I just feel like people might

03:11:14.494 --> 03:11:17.164
be upset, and they may just leave.

03:11:17.164 --> 03:11:19.736
Or maybe they may go somewhere else for that connection.

03:11:19.736 --> 03:11:20.704
And I think that would be fine.

03:11:20.704 --> 03:11:23.864
But I certainly wouldn't want to string someone else along

03:11:23.864 --> 03:11:24.924
if that was available,

03:11:24.924 --> 03:11:26.124
and that's what they were searching for.

03:11:26.124 --> 03:11:27.004
LAURA: That's true.

03:11:27.004 --> 03:11:31.404
But, but, but if everybody comes here and they find out,

03:11:31.404 --> 03:11:33.604
there's all these other people that worship the Traveler,

03:11:33.604 --> 03:11:36.187
and they find connection with each other,

03:11:37.273 --> 03:11:39.684
then suddenly they have that camaraderie.

03:11:39.684 --> 03:11:41.784
Suddenly, they have a group of people

03:11:41.784 --> 03:11:43.994
that have the same common interests as them

03:11:43.994 --> 03:11:47.464
and they can be friends and have each other's back

03:11:47.464 --> 03:11:51.684
and he'll have, like, his own church, you know.

03:11:51.684 --> 03:11:52.667
TRAVIS: That is true.

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:55.554
And that would be wonderful.

03:11:57.264 --> 03:12:01.444
LAURA: Is it really that bad, if it's making people happy?

03:12:01.444 --> 03:12:02.324
TRAVIS: No.

03:12:02.324 --> 03:12:04.582
I don't... (sighs)

03:12:05.607 --> 03:12:08.054
I don't think so.

03:12:08.054 --> 03:12:10.654
People can do whatever they want to.

03:12:10.654 --> 03:12:13.854
They can lead a life however they choose.

03:12:13.854 --> 03:12:15.694
And as long as it doesn't interfere with other people,

03:12:15.694 --> 03:12:18.434
at least for me, I think that's fine.

03:12:18.434 --> 03:12:20.974
Knowing that on the other side of that

03:12:20.974 --> 03:12:22.944
it's not reciprocated,

03:12:22.944 --> 03:12:26.197
I can't answer that question for you, Jester.

03:12:26.197 --> 03:12:31.197
But, as long as-- I have to be honest.

03:12:31.314 --> 03:12:34.964
Also, I don't really care about 200 other people.

03:12:34.964 --> 03:12:36.589
I do care about you.

03:12:37.624 --> 03:12:40.894
So as long as you're getting what you want out of this,

03:12:40.894 --> 03:12:42.604
you're not being forced into being something

03:12:42.604 --> 03:12:45.154
that you think you need to be for him,

03:12:46.355 --> 03:12:48.244
then you can do whatever you want to.

03:12:48.244 --> 03:12:50.686
And I, and we, will all back you up.

03:12:51.924 --> 03:12:56.112
But if at any moment it puts you at risk for him,

03:12:58.084 --> 03:13:00.126
I won't be all right with that.

03:13:02.644 --> 03:13:03.477
LAURA: Okay.

03:13:05.134 --> 03:13:05.967
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:13:06.894 --> 03:13:08.664
One last thing.
LAURA: Yeah?

03:13:10.411 --> 03:13:12.564
TRAVIS: You can tell us

03:13:12.564 --> 03:13:14.964
if something happens when you speak with him.

03:13:15.884 --> 03:13:19.764
Last time it seemed like you carried it for a long time.

03:13:19.764 --> 03:13:22.687
You can tell me.

03:13:24.489 --> 03:13:25.914
I'll listen.

03:13:28.444 --> 03:13:29.277
LAURA: Okay.

03:13:30.154 --> 03:13:30.987
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:13:33.434 --> 03:13:34.467
Oh, shit.

03:13:35.543 --> 03:13:36.964
We have a whole convention to plan.

03:13:36.964 --> 03:13:38.039
LAURA: Oh god.

03:13:39.404 --> 03:13:40.237
Yeah.

03:13:42.184 --> 03:13:43.526
We'll figure it out.

03:13:44.444 --> 03:13:46.065
TRAVIS: No problem.

03:13:46.065 --> 03:13:48.140
LAURA: (laughs tearfully)

03:13:49.279 --> 03:13:50.112
(sighs)

03:13:51.383 --> 03:13:53.675
TRAVIS: Night.
LAURA: Night, yeah.

03:13:54.996 --> 03:13:56.899
It's still the afternoon, but--

03:13:56.899 --> 03:13:58.925
TRAVIS: I'm so tired.
SAM: It's two o'clock.

03:13:58.925 --> 03:14:01.424
(laughter)

03:14:01.424 --> 03:14:03.154
TALIESIN: Cappuccino, cappuccino, cappuccino?

03:14:03.154 --> 03:14:03.987
TRAVIS: Yes, do you have one?

03:14:03.987 --> 03:14:05.974
MARISHA: Oh Caduceus, you're making cappuccinos?

03:14:05.974 --> 03:14:08.734
TALIESIN: I don't have any of the things.
MARISHA: Caduceus, are you making tea?

03:14:08.734 --> 03:14:11.494
TALIESIN: The only thing I have to make--
MARISHA: Caduceus, please make tea.

03:14:11.494 --> 03:14:13.514
LIAM: Are any of your dead people give a little kick

03:14:13.514 --> 03:14:14.494
or something?
MARISHA: Just please,

03:14:14.494 --> 03:14:16.044
like, caffeinated dead people.

03:14:16.044 --> 03:14:18.004
TALIESIN: I've already got a kettle going.

03:14:18.004 --> 03:14:19.204
I've had one going for a while.

03:14:19.204 --> 03:14:22.304
It's really hard to boil water
on it just with what they have.

03:14:22.304 --> 03:14:25.534
LIAM: You don't have any Monster Energy dead people?

03:14:25.534 --> 03:14:27.264
TALIESIN: Only what I got for myself.

03:14:27.264 --> 03:14:28.414
TRAVIS: Of course it's red.

03:14:28.414 --> 03:14:29.554
Of course it's red.

03:14:29.554 --> 03:14:31.163
TALIESIN: My poison bottle.
SAM: A bottle of blood.

03:14:31.163 --> 03:14:33.004
(laughter)

03:14:33.004 --> 03:14:35.494
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got a kettle going.

03:14:35.494 --> 03:14:39.774
MATT: As the afternoon turns into evening and dusk settles,

03:14:39.774 --> 03:14:44.774
you begin to gather with the rest of the people of Vo.

03:14:45.284 --> 03:14:49.684
Looking around, it seems that
the majority of people are here.

03:14:49.684 --> 03:14:51.431
The bonfire is going.

03:14:54.594 --> 03:14:55.684
There isn't a fresh hunt.

03:14:55.684 --> 03:15:00.024
There's still remnants left of previous gatherings,

03:15:00.024 --> 03:15:03.614
but nevertheless, small meals are distributed.

03:15:03.614 --> 03:15:05.424
There is-- it's a lot less jovial

03:15:05.424 --> 03:15:08.184
than the last social gathering

03:15:08.184 --> 03:15:10.534
that you guys were involved with here.

03:15:10.534 --> 03:15:14.449
But a short time into it, you watch as Vilya stands up.

03:15:16.784 --> 03:15:19.954
Deramid-- Lukash as you previously knew him as,

03:15:19.954 --> 03:15:21.834
is standing not too far off to the side,

03:15:21.834 --> 03:15:23.989
arms crossed, just keeping eyes out.

03:15:25.844 --> 03:15:29.684
No sign of Terra, or Kotho, and her crew.

03:15:30.944 --> 03:15:32.014
But as everyone gathers around,

03:15:32.014 --> 03:15:34.044
you can see there's muttering in conversation

03:15:34.044 --> 03:15:35.944
before Vilya stands up and takes the staff

03:15:35.944 --> 03:15:38.634
and hits it once hard against the stone top

03:15:38.634 --> 03:15:41.814
of one of these tables, and as it does,

03:15:41.814 --> 03:15:43.737
a hush falls over.

03:15:45.374 --> 03:15:47.714
As it does, you can see the fire light crackling behind her,

03:15:47.714 --> 03:15:50.644
framing her in almost a silhouette.

03:15:50.644 --> 03:15:54.194
And as she begins to speak, with her voice

03:15:54.194 --> 03:15:55.974
the front of the staff begins to glow

03:15:55.974 --> 03:15:58.804
and seems to flicker with the volume of her speech,

03:15:58.804 --> 03:16:01.064
lighting her from the front.

03:16:01.064 --> 03:16:05.849
And she goes, "My friends, my family,

03:16:06.914 --> 03:16:09.114
"the people of this island and this community,

03:16:10.434 --> 03:16:12.334
"I've been your guardian for some time,

03:16:13.260 --> 03:16:15.264
"and that time will soon come to an end,

03:16:15.264 --> 03:16:18.952
"for we are in a dire time of transition."

03:16:19.995 --> 03:16:21.774
And you hear a few voices go, "Yeah,
you can fucking say that again,"

03:16:21.774 --> 03:16:22.962
and then, "Ssh!"

03:16:26.844 --> 03:16:28.711
(as Vilya) "It is strange to be living--

03:16:30.004 --> 03:16:33.427
"I can't say a lie, because we <i>have</i> been living,

03:16:35.354 --> 03:16:37.396
"and regardless of who we once were,

03:16:38.674 --> 03:16:43.031
"what we became in this community means something.

03:16:44.244 --> 03:16:46.980
"It's your choice to take that to heart,

03:16:46.980 --> 03:16:48.384
"and it's your choice to take that

03:16:48.384 --> 03:16:50.142
"where you will in the future.

03:16:51.454 --> 03:16:52.824
"I know a number of you

03:16:52.824 --> 03:16:55.616
"are racing to get back to the lives you once had.

03:16:56.634 --> 03:16:58.854
"And there is no judgment there whatsoever.

03:16:58.854 --> 03:17:02.251
"I will see to that travel, as best as I can.

03:17:03.824 --> 03:17:05.534
"Though it may take some time.

03:17:07.015 --> 03:17:09.223
"For those that do wish to stay,

03:17:10.634 --> 03:17:12.617
"this community is not leaving.

03:17:14.184 --> 03:17:17.764
"I've already spoken with a few that are going to keep it.

03:17:17.764 --> 03:17:19.556
"And you're ever welcome.

03:17:23.624 --> 03:17:25.316
"I know it's a hard time,

03:17:29.144 --> 03:17:32.544
"but I would just ask for your trust and cooperation,

03:17:33.674 --> 03:17:36.781
"as we all ford through this transition

03:17:38.014 --> 03:17:39.264
"respectfully.

03:17:42.424 --> 03:17:44.141
"It I might ask that of you.

03:17:45.941 --> 03:17:47.291
"I would greatly appreciate it."

03:17:48.324 --> 03:17:50.024
And there's some muttering,

03:17:50.024 --> 03:17:51.934
then the conversation start building up at this point.

03:17:51.934 --> 03:17:53.054
People start raising voices

03:17:53.054 --> 03:17:55.514
and people start standing up and being like, you know,

03:17:55.514 --> 03:17:58.228
"What are we supposed to do now?

03:17:58.228 --> 03:17:59.369
"I have a family here

03:17:59.369 --> 03:18:01.774
"and a family that I haven't seen 15 years."

03:18:01.774 --> 03:18:02.954
And people are, like, rising up

03:18:02.954 --> 03:18:04.164
and offering suggestions here be like,

03:18:04.164 --> 03:18:05.731
"Well, you got to pick one, can't you?"

03:18:05.731 --> 03:18:07.804
"Why can't you have a conversation
and make it a bigger family?"

03:18:07.804 --> 03:18:08.964
It's like, "It's not that easy!"

03:18:08.964 --> 03:18:11.984
And it starts getting bigger and Lukash, or as you know

03:18:11.984 --> 03:18:13.774
him how as Deramid-- he's like, "Silence, please!

03:18:13.774 --> 03:18:15.274
"We're trying to work this out."

03:18:16.644 --> 03:18:18.084
Then the conversation continues anew

03:18:18.084 --> 03:18:23.084
and it becomes a community forum,

03:18:23.554 --> 03:18:25.854
in which there are points of tension

03:18:25.854 --> 03:18:29.014
that are broken and there are points of reconciliation.

03:18:29.014 --> 03:18:31.274
There are offerings of different perspectives.

03:18:31.274 --> 03:18:34.244
And it's lengthy. For the next hour and a half to two hours,

03:18:34.244 --> 03:18:38.592
it is a lot of intense emotions, across the spectrum.

03:18:40.044 --> 03:18:43.836
But it finally comes to the point to where Vilya

03:18:44.704 --> 03:18:46.744
seems to have pushed enough

03:18:46.744 --> 03:18:49.074
and pressed enough into the people here

03:18:49.074 --> 03:18:50.866
that there is a path either way.

03:18:53.404 --> 03:18:58.404
And she says, "You will live the life you want.

03:18:59.074 --> 03:19:00.084
"It is yours to figure out,

03:19:00.084 --> 03:19:01.624
"and I'm sorry it's so complicated.

03:19:01.624 --> 03:19:04.254
"I'm sorry that it's fraught with heartbreak,

03:19:04.254 --> 03:19:09.254
"confusion, and challenges for endless days ahead.

03:19:09.924 --> 03:19:11.366
"We didn't choose this.

03:19:13.224 --> 03:19:14.314
"But it's in our power

03:19:14.314 --> 03:19:16.014
"to decide what we do with it next.

03:19:17.774 --> 03:19:19.274
"And this is going to make for a hell of a story

03:19:19.274 --> 03:19:21.607
"for the bards to sing for years to come.

03:19:26.844 --> 03:19:28.714
"My friends," and she points over towards

03:19:28.714 --> 03:19:30.924
where you guys have been sitting off to the side.

03:19:32.964 --> 03:19:34.414
"They were the ones that aided

03:19:35.434 --> 03:19:38.714
"in alleviating us of this fog of mind

03:19:38.714 --> 03:19:41.954
"and mist of island that kept us clouded

03:19:41.954 --> 03:19:45.026
"and unable to make the life our own.

03:19:49.654 --> 03:19:54.034
"So please, show them respect as well

03:19:54.034 --> 03:19:55.634
"as you would do myself.

03:19:59.664 --> 03:20:00.814
"But for tonight,

03:20:01.834 --> 03:20:03.434
"even if this is your last night,

03:20:04.484 --> 03:20:08.517
"can we please have one more night

03:20:10.051 --> 03:20:11.842
"as Vo."

03:20:14.300 --> 03:20:17.194
You notice this still pause.

03:20:20.594 --> 03:20:22.494
You see folks stand up and go, "Aye."

03:20:24.124 --> 03:20:26.134
Raise a drink.

03:20:26.134 --> 03:20:27.807
Five over here go, "Aye."

03:20:30.006 --> 03:20:32.420
A few stragglers. "Aye, aye, aye."

03:20:32.420 --> 03:20:33.311
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy

03:20:33.311 --> 03:20:34.918
to make it sound like a lot more people were saying "aye".

03:20:34.918 --> 03:20:36.264
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: Okay.

03:20:36.264 --> 03:20:38.764
And with a rousing crowd, eventually,

03:20:39.674 --> 03:20:42.454
pretty much everybody begins to rise,

03:20:42.454 --> 03:20:44.204
some with more gusto than others.

03:20:44.204 --> 03:20:48.224
And you even see Kotho and her team

03:20:48.224 --> 03:20:49.954
emerge from the shadows,

03:20:49.954 --> 03:20:52.994
who apparently had been watching from a distance,

03:20:52.994 --> 03:20:54.832
say, "Aye."

03:20:57.185 --> 03:21:00.589
And with that, this little child comes running out

03:21:00.589 --> 03:21:03.832
to the edge of the fire and holds something to it

03:21:03.832 --> 03:21:06.184
and (hissing, explosions)

03:21:06.184 --> 03:21:09.264
All these fireworks start detonating loudly.

03:21:09.264 --> 03:21:10.234
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:21:10.234 --> 03:21:12.504
MATT: Which in a moment causes me to go, "Whoa!

03:21:13.424 --> 03:21:14.344
"Yeah!"

03:21:14.344 --> 03:21:15.834
And then breaks into cheers.

03:21:15.834 --> 03:21:17.821
LIAM: For the VO community!

03:21:17.821 --> 03:21:19.256
(laughter)

03:21:19.256 --> 03:21:20.931
TALIESIN: Every night, for months on end,

03:21:20.931 --> 03:21:22.372
that same child comes out-- sorry.

03:21:22.372 --> 03:21:24.564
I'm flashing back to my own trying to sleep at night.

03:21:24.564 --> 03:21:25.397
MARISHA: Was it Treece?

03:21:26.414 --> 03:21:27.247
TALIESIN: Was it trees?

03:21:27.247 --> 03:21:28.472
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, Treece.
MATT: Yes, it was.

03:21:28.472 --> 03:21:30.057
Yes, it was Treece.
MARISHA: Yeah, hell yeah.

03:21:30.057 --> 03:21:32.258
TALIESIN: Well done.
TRAVIS: Or the Vo formerly known as Treece.

03:21:32.258 --> 03:21:33.634
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:21:33.634 --> 03:21:36.982
SAM: His real name is Twig.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:21:36.982 --> 03:21:40.084
MATT: But it seems that at least for the time being,

03:21:40.084 --> 03:21:43.374
for this night, tensions are at a manageable level.

03:21:44.814 --> 03:21:48.314
And there is an acceptance that people are parting ways.

03:21:50.264 --> 03:21:55.044
As the people begin to mingle once more,

03:21:55.044 --> 03:21:59.974
and the tension begins to shift to a more positive place,

03:21:59.974 --> 03:22:01.474
Vilya begins walking amongst

03:22:01.474 --> 03:22:04.034
and talking to people in small groups about

03:22:05.164 --> 03:22:06.834
the reminder of people coming.

03:22:08.174 --> 03:22:09.654
Says that, "There are individuals coming

03:22:09.654 --> 03:22:11.734
"as part of a worship ceremony,

03:22:11.734 --> 03:22:14.964
"at the behest of the people that aided us in this freedom.

03:22:14.964 --> 03:22:16.984
"For those who are staying, we would ask of your help

03:22:16.984 --> 03:22:19.184
"to be good hosts.

03:22:20.284 --> 03:22:22.324
"And who knows, maybe some

03:22:23.614 --> 03:22:28.614
"find better here as we have, at some points."

03:22:28.834 --> 03:22:30.074
And some people are weird about it,

03:22:30.074 --> 03:22:31.384
some people are okay with it,

03:22:31.384 --> 03:22:32.834
some folks are happy to help.

03:22:34.234 --> 03:22:37.894
But the night celebrations are yours,

03:22:37.894 --> 03:22:39.504
if you have any particular things you wish to do

03:22:39.504 --> 03:22:41.147
before the day is done.

03:22:41.147 --> 03:22:42.914
LIAM: As people are celebrating,

03:22:42.914 --> 03:22:45.644
even during that speech, little by little,

03:22:45.644 --> 03:22:48.354
every minute, I use Control Flames,

03:22:48.354 --> 03:22:52.724
just to slowly turn the fire in the heart of it all green.

03:22:54.394 --> 03:22:56.304
Gradually over time, darker and darker.

03:22:56.304 --> 03:22:57.844
MATT: And you managed to do so.

03:22:57.844 --> 03:22:59.034
And as it does,

03:23:00.874 --> 03:23:01.904
people take notice

03:23:01.904 --> 03:23:05.684
and it has this additional awe

03:23:05.684 --> 03:23:08.954
to the experience in the speech as it progresses.

03:23:10.094 --> 03:23:11.674
SAM: Jester, to do want to

03:23:11.674 --> 03:23:13.964
try to recruit people to help

03:23:13.964 --> 03:23:15.604
with the planning of your--?

03:23:15.604 --> 03:23:17.674
LAURA: I've already started that.

03:23:17.674 --> 03:23:19.084
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:23:19.084 --> 03:23:23.324
There's-- our family that that gave up the house,

03:23:23.324 --> 03:23:26.204
they're going to start running a resort here.

03:23:26.204 --> 03:23:28.564
SAM: Well, I was thinking--

03:23:28.564 --> 03:23:29.614
yeah, that's a great idea.

03:23:29.614 --> 03:23:30.944
No, I've been thinking about that,

03:23:30.944 --> 03:23:33.754
and do we need more than them, though?

03:23:33.754 --> 03:23:36.294
LAURA: Yeah, they said they were
going to talk to other people.

03:23:36.294 --> 03:23:38.174
SAM: Because maybe we should

03:23:38.174 --> 03:23:41.554
make that pitch to the greater community.

03:23:41.554 --> 03:23:43.321
LAURA: Oh, like right now?
SAM: Maybe?

03:23:44.944 --> 03:23:47.074
TALIESIN: Can I hear this conversation?

03:23:47.074 --> 03:23:48.224
MATT: I don't know, are you guys keeping it?

03:23:48.224 --> 03:23:49.584
LIAM: Thought you could hear all conversations.

03:23:49.584 --> 03:23:50.814
TALIESIN: It's true. If I'm even--

03:23:50.814 --> 03:23:52.064
LAURA: I mean, we're by everyone else.

03:23:52.064 --> 03:23:54.204
MATT: Yeah, so you probably pick up on it.

03:23:54.204 --> 03:23:56.364
TALIESIN: As someone who has dealt with a lot of people

03:23:56.364 --> 03:23:58.454
going through traumatic experiences,

03:23:59.344 --> 03:24:01.044
you may want to give it til morning,

03:24:01.044 --> 03:24:03.514
before you propose a new way of life.

03:24:03.514 --> 03:24:05.534
I think in the morning, you could rally some people

03:24:05.534 --> 03:24:08.682
to the idea of opening the island up.

03:24:08.682 --> 03:24:09.706
LIAM: That makes sense.

03:24:09.706 --> 03:24:11.447
TALIESIN: On a more permanent basis.

03:24:11.447 --> 03:24:14.314
But I'd give them a good night's sleep before,

03:24:15.644 --> 03:24:20.044
to mourn a very difficult moment in their lives.

03:24:20.044 --> 03:24:22.774
Just so that you have a better chance

03:24:22.774 --> 03:24:24.844
of getting people on board.

03:24:24.844 --> 03:24:26.764
LAURA: That makes sense.
SAM: Sure.

03:24:26.764 --> 03:24:28.955
LAURA: Yeah. It's not like they would get an influx of

03:24:28.955 --> 03:24:31.224
visitors all the time.
TALIESIN: No.

03:24:31.224 --> 03:24:33.690
LAURA: You know, this could be, like, a famous island.

03:24:33.690 --> 03:24:36.034
People could come visit from all over the world

03:24:36.034 --> 03:24:38.704
because, like, the famous island of Rumblecusp,

03:24:38.704 --> 03:24:42.424
where you may lose your memory, you may not.

03:24:42.424 --> 03:24:45.159
TALIESIN: Two big decisions in one
day is a lot for most people.

03:24:45.159 --> 03:24:46.894
They've had one big moment.

03:24:47.904 --> 03:24:49.739
MARISHA: You're right.
TALIESIN: Give them 12 hours.

03:24:49.739 --> 03:24:51.179
LAURA: What happens in Rumblecusp--

03:24:51.179 --> 03:24:52.549
LAURA and MARISHA: -- stays in Rumblecusp.

03:24:52.549 --> 03:24:54.804
SAM: There's so much cool stuff on this island.

03:24:54.804 --> 03:24:57.466
MARISHA: Someone could run a ghost tour

03:24:57.466 --> 03:24:58.924
because there's so many fucking ghosts.

03:24:58.924 --> 03:25:00.324
LAURA: They could run a ghost tour,

03:25:00.324 --> 03:25:02.954
they could look for dinosaurs.

03:25:02.954 --> 03:25:03.963
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:25:03.963 --> 03:25:05.584
SAM: I was actually thinking about this, yes.

03:25:05.584 --> 03:25:08.594
You've been making these amazing pamphlets, right?

03:25:08.594 --> 03:25:09.427
LAURA: Yeah.

03:25:09.427 --> 03:25:14.427
SAM: You could make some to advertise Rumblecusp.

03:25:14.731 --> 03:25:17.704
You know, like you're saying. Like,

03:25:17.704 --> 03:25:20.759
"Welcome to the cusp of relaxation!"

03:25:20.759 --> 03:25:21.675
LAURA: (gasps)
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:25:21.675 --> 03:25:23.124
SAM: "Rumblecusp island:"

03:25:23.124 --> 03:25:26.294
LAURA: Really good.
SAM: "where you can forget all your woes."

03:25:26.294 --> 03:25:27.481
LAURA: I love it.

03:25:27.481 --> 03:25:29.641
SAM: I love the dinosaur--
TALIESIN: Can you ride the dinosaur?

03:25:29.641 --> 03:25:31.424
I've always thought that could be fun.

03:25:31.424 --> 03:25:33.884
MARISHA: The signature cocktail could be the torchbloom.

03:25:33.884 --> 03:25:36.764
SAM: Yeah, you can get it at Anola's Bar and Grille.

03:25:36.764 --> 03:25:40.204
And also, I was thinking we could offer

03:25:40.204 --> 03:25:43.434
some sort of a health/wellness center.

03:25:43.434 --> 03:25:45.934
So like, if they wanted to at the Heaven Falls,

03:25:45.934 --> 03:25:47.751
they could get a power colonic.

03:25:47.751 --> 03:25:49.854
(laughter)
LIAM: Ooh!

03:25:49.854 --> 03:25:51.504
SAM: Butthole of the island, you know.

03:25:51.504 --> 03:25:52.337
LAURA: That's really good.

03:25:52.337 --> 03:25:54.004
LIAM: Maybe a yearly music festival,

03:25:54.004 --> 03:25:55.604
Rumble in the Cusp, you know?

03:25:56.624 --> 03:25:59.095
MARISHA: Yeah, the Rumble Down Under? Yeah.

03:25:59.095 --> 03:26:00.994
LIAM: Also, Jester,

03:26:00.994 --> 03:26:03.894
as you've expressed to us, your friend

03:26:03.894 --> 03:26:05.434
is maybe balking at the idea

03:26:05.434 --> 03:26:09.184
of ruling over people across the continents in the world,

03:26:09.184 --> 03:26:11.614
but maybe he would like to be the headliner

03:26:11.614 --> 03:26:13.554
of a resort island?

03:26:13.554 --> 03:26:14.706
LAURA: I know. I mean, that's--

03:26:14.706 --> 03:26:17.706
I was just talking about that with...Caduceus?

03:26:19.064 --> 03:26:20.531
TALIESIN: Were we?

03:26:20.531 --> 03:26:22.421
LAURA: Maybe.
TALIESIN: Maybe.

03:26:22.421 --> 03:26:23.528
LAURA: Was it Fjord?

03:26:23.528 --> 03:26:24.569
Who did I say it to?

03:26:24.569 --> 03:26:26.299
I don't remember.
TRAVIS: Super forgettable, apparently.

03:26:26.299 --> 03:26:27.487
MARISHA: (laughs)
LAURA: Was it Fjord?

03:26:27.487 --> 03:26:29.354
Was it you that I said that to?

03:26:29.354 --> 03:26:32.263
MARISHA: Vokodo is dead, by the way.
TRAVIS: Mr. Irrelevant.

03:26:32.263 --> 03:26:35.784
LAURA: I know that we had a really awesome conversation.

03:26:35.784 --> 03:26:37.375
I just don't know who I said.
LIAM: Maybe it was in the car

03:26:37.375 --> 03:26:39.015
on the way home after a game?

03:26:39.015 --> 03:26:39.848
LAURA: Huh?

03:26:42.487 --> 03:26:45.314
LIAM: From our short time with him, he's clearly very vain,

03:26:45.314 --> 03:26:46.934
so maybe.
LAURA: He's not!

03:26:46.934 --> 03:26:47.767
No.

03:26:47.767 --> 03:26:49.674
LIAM: Are you sure?
LAURA: It's not that--

03:26:49.674 --> 03:26:50.886
LIAM: He's not vain?

03:26:52.034 --> 03:26:55.944
LAURA: I don't think he's <i>vain</i>.

03:26:55.944 --> 03:26:57.727
TALIESIN: I think it's appropriate.
MARISHA: He's vain.

03:26:57.727 --> 03:26:59.621
MARISHA: He's definitely vain.
LAURA: He's probably kind of vain.

03:26:59.621 --> 03:27:01.684
LIAM: Probably thinks this song is about him.

03:27:01.684 --> 03:27:02.784
MARISHA: Absolutely.

03:27:04.472 --> 03:27:06.054
LAURA: I mean, he's amazing.

03:27:06.054 --> 03:27:08.214
Why wouldn't you be vain if you were amazing?

03:27:09.244 --> 03:27:10.293
LIAM: You would be.

03:27:10.293 --> 03:27:12.993
TALIESIN: So amazing, you weren't vain.

03:27:13.854 --> 03:27:15.704
That'd be pretty amazing.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:27:15.704 --> 03:27:16.734
LIAM: None of you are vain, though,

03:27:16.734 --> 03:27:18.254
and you're all pretty good.

03:27:18.254 --> 03:27:19.087
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:27:19.087 --> 03:27:21.554
So we're going to turn it into a resort.

03:27:21.554 --> 03:27:24.804
SAM: 100%. Yoga meditation at the Ruins.

03:27:24.804 --> 03:27:25.854
I mean, it's like--

03:27:25.854 --> 03:27:30.327
ASHLEY: Make a big gate into the dinosaur area.

03:27:30.327 --> 03:27:32.074
LAURA: Ooh, I like it.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

03:27:32.074 --> 03:27:35.474
ASHLEY: That you could go through on a--
LAURA: Dinosaur Park.

03:27:35.474 --> 03:27:36.954
TRAVIS: And you could use that warding stone

03:27:36.954 --> 03:27:38.814
to play music as it opens.

03:27:38.814 --> 03:27:39.797
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:27:39.797 --> 03:27:41.634
TRAVIS: Be like, (hums Jurassic Park theme)

03:27:41.634 --> 03:27:42.824
MATT: Nothing ever goes wrong--

03:27:42.824 --> 03:27:44.554
ASHLEY: We could workshop the song.

03:27:44.554 --> 03:27:45.796
MATT: -- at those types of resorts.

03:27:45.796 --> 03:27:49.334
MARISHA: I bet the two of you could lay something down.

03:27:49.334 --> 03:27:50.654
An epic theme.

03:27:50.654 --> 03:27:52.054
LAURA: Ooh.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:27:52.054 --> 03:27:55.274
ASHLEY: You know, I really like the possibility.
LIAM and SAM: Water slide.

03:27:55.274 --> 03:27:56.307
TALIESIN: I was really hoping for a water slide.

03:27:56.307 --> 03:27:57.881
LIAM: People ride from the top of the volcano

03:27:57.881 --> 03:27:59.673
down to the waterfall,

03:27:59.673 --> 03:28:02.204
shot up to go again, no lines, no waiting.

03:28:02.204 --> 03:28:05.364
MARISHA: Also since we, you know, saved this island

03:28:05.364 --> 03:28:07.804
and we're pretty much the best,

03:28:07.804 --> 03:28:11.504
maybe we could have some choice real estate,

03:28:11.504 --> 03:28:13.584
a condo, basically a timeshare.

03:28:13.584 --> 03:28:16.024
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Did you turn into Lex Luthor?

03:28:16.024 --> 03:28:17.541
TALIESIN: A little bit.
TRAVIS: Otisville?

03:28:17.541 --> 03:28:19.014
MARISHA: A little bit.
TRAVIS: Otisburg?

03:28:19.014 --> 03:28:22.778
MARISHA: Just right in the chasm of the volcano. Yeah.

03:28:22.778 --> 03:28:24.619
(laughter)
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:28:24.619 --> 03:28:27.903
SAM: Save an owner's condo, an owner's suite for us?

03:28:27.903 --> 03:28:28.924
LAURA: Yeah.

03:28:28.924 --> 03:28:31.644
LIAM: Hidden behind the waterfall. You know, out of the way.

03:28:31.644 --> 03:28:32.477
SAM: Yeah.

03:28:32.477 --> 03:28:35.024
ASHLEY: A vacation spot that we just go to

03:28:35.024 --> 03:28:36.757
whenever we want.
TRAVIS: Just turn it into a pyramid scheme.

03:28:36.757 --> 03:28:39.114
LIAM: The 99 Club, maybe.
LAURA: I love that.

03:28:39.114 --> 03:28:41.426
MARISHA: Maybe Caleb can build a teleportation circle in it.

03:28:41.426 --> 03:28:44.115
SAM: I don't know, maybe we should stay here.

03:28:44.115 --> 03:28:45.714
LAURA: Maybe this should be our base of operation.

03:28:45.714 --> 03:28:46.765
MATT: This is where the campaign ends.

03:28:46.765 --> 03:28:48.742
(laughter)

03:28:48.742 --> 03:28:50.633
LAURA: We don't lose our memory.
TALIESIN: Trying to become D&amp;D Fantasy island.

03:28:50.633 --> 03:28:52.366
People show up, we fix their problems,

03:28:52.366 --> 03:28:54.099
and send them on their way.

03:28:55.642 --> 03:28:57.534
MARISHA: Then it's Roller Coaster Tycoon.

03:28:57.534 --> 03:28:58.367
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:28:58.367 --> 03:29:01.187
TRAVIS: Unseated a wannabe-deity and replaced him with us.

03:29:01.187 --> 03:29:03.684
(laughter)

03:29:03.684 --> 03:29:05.424
LAURA: Bring us your offerings.

03:29:05.424 --> 03:29:08.994
TALIESIN: What is it? A cargo cult on top of a cargo cult.

03:29:08.994 --> 03:29:11.474
It's like this ice cream sundae of cargo cults.

03:29:11.474 --> 03:29:12.754
MATT: Yeah.

03:29:12.754 --> 03:29:13.684
TALIESIN: With sprinkles.

03:29:13.684 --> 03:29:15.194
Hey!
LAURA: Hey!

03:29:15.194 --> 03:29:16.474
LIAM: Behold, Beauregard,

03:29:16.474 --> 03:29:18.413
goddess of the booze cruise.

03:29:18.413 --> 03:29:20.086
(laughter)
SAM: Oh, yes!

03:29:20.086 --> 03:29:22.838
MARISHA: I've got a bottomless flask of whiskey, let's go!

03:29:22.838 --> 03:29:24.421
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:29:26.154 --> 03:29:27.288
MATT: So anyway.

03:29:27.288 --> 03:29:30.200
(laughter)

03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:32.364
SAM: Give us 20 minutes, Matt.
MATT: Yeah.

03:29:32.364 --> 03:29:34.004
(laughter)
MARISHA: Pack of water,

03:29:34.004 --> 03:29:37.004
I'm drunk, I don't know, it's a pack of water.

03:29:37.004 --> 03:29:37.837
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry.

03:29:37.837 --> 03:29:39.024
Where did I put my gravitas?

03:29:39.024 --> 03:29:40.914
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:29:42.824 --> 03:29:46.163
MATT: So as the evening's celebrations commence and go on,

03:29:46.163 --> 03:29:47.188
is there anything else we should do

03:29:47.188 --> 03:29:48.614
before the night comes to a close?

03:29:51.124 --> 03:29:53.514
TRAVIS: Is Kotho around at all?

03:29:55.744 --> 03:29:57.324
MATT: Yes.

03:29:57.324 --> 03:29:58.674
A little ways away from the rest of the group

03:29:58.674 --> 03:30:02.254
and just keeping amongst her three other mates, but...

03:30:03.774 --> 03:30:05.514
TRAVIS: I'll slide over and just say,

03:30:05.514 --> 03:30:07.774
I'm sorry, I thought of one last thing,

03:30:07.774 --> 03:30:10.674
I know you said your last target wasn't here on the island.

03:30:10.674 --> 03:30:12.184
Would you be comfortable sharing the name

03:30:12.184 --> 03:30:13.724
of who you were looking for?

03:30:13.724 --> 03:30:16.364
I spent a lot of time in Port Damali

03:30:16.364 --> 03:30:19.294
and Nicodranas in the past few years.

03:30:19.294 --> 03:30:20.954
Just in case I might be able

03:30:20.954 --> 03:30:21.934
to point you in the right direction

03:30:21.934 --> 03:30:23.184
once you get out of here.

03:30:27.244 --> 03:30:28.854
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
MARISHA: Come on.

03:30:28.854 --> 03:30:30.742
SAM: Come on, come on.
MARISHA: Come on!

03:30:30.742 --> 03:30:32.574
SAM: Cast Friends on them, cast Friends on them, come on!

03:30:32.574 --> 03:30:33.704
TRAVIS: I don't think it works that way.

03:30:33.704 --> 03:30:35.645
SAM: Just do it.

03:30:35.645 --> 03:30:36.875
TRAVIS: It's a natural one.

03:30:36.875 --> 03:30:38.583
(groaning)

03:30:38.583 --> 03:30:39.708
LAURA: Oh no.

03:30:39.708 --> 03:30:41.346
MARISHA: Bullshit.

03:30:41.346 --> 03:30:43.394
SAM: Fortune's Favor!
MARISHA: Fuck you, dice.

03:30:43.394 --> 03:30:45.976
LIAM: Caleb runs over with the pearl.

03:30:45.976 --> 03:30:48.276
TALIESIN: High five.
MATT: Kotho goes,

03:30:51.504 --> 03:30:56.244
"I appreciate your spirit of pursuit,

03:30:56.244 --> 03:30:59.204
"but no matter how long ago it is,

03:31:00.994 --> 03:31:02.284
"the reason I make my reputation

03:31:02.284 --> 03:31:06.004
"is by keeping my clients' information to myself.

03:31:06.004 --> 03:31:07.394
"I hope you can respect that."

03:31:07.394 --> 03:31:08.504
TRAVIS: I can.

03:31:08.504 --> 03:31:09.896
Always the professional.

03:31:10.784 --> 03:31:11.784
Have a good evening.

03:31:13.064 --> 03:31:13.944
Fucking--!

03:31:13.944 --> 03:31:14.777
MATT: I know.

03:31:14.777 --> 03:31:16.994
MARISHA: Bullshit. That sucks, dude.

03:31:16.994 --> 03:31:18.664
MATT: Sorry, buddy.
TRAVIS: It's all right.

03:31:18.664 --> 03:31:20.444
MARISHA: Is Vilya around?
SAM: Oh yeah, we got to talk to her.

03:31:20.444 --> 03:31:22.824
MATT: Vilya is.

03:31:22.824 --> 03:31:26.874
Vilya's in caretaker mode,

03:31:26.874 --> 03:31:29.254
and is looking for people in the crowd

03:31:29.254 --> 03:31:30.514
that are needing,

03:31:32.404 --> 03:31:37.404
whether it be support or a conversation to ease tension.

03:31:37.754 --> 03:31:40.984
She's very in tune with the people of the village

03:31:40.984 --> 03:31:43.204
and at least the moods that are around, and is

03:31:43.204 --> 03:31:44.714
jumping from one to the next,

03:31:44.714 --> 03:31:47.774
to keep things going.

03:31:47.774 --> 03:31:50.224
MARISHA: I try to make eye contact with her.

03:31:51.084 --> 03:31:52.250
MATT: "Of course.

03:31:54.044 --> 03:31:56.294
"If you'll excuse me just a moment, thank you."

03:31:57.734 --> 03:32:00.964
And she walks over and approaches. "Beauregard?"

03:32:00.964 --> 03:32:02.367
MARISHA: Nott gave me--

03:32:03.384 --> 03:32:06.334
Veth gave me a bottomless flask full of whisky.

03:32:06.334 --> 03:32:07.304
You want some?

03:32:07.304 --> 03:32:10.354
MATT: "Oh, I'm good, thank you. My family doesn't drink."

03:32:10.354 --> 03:32:11.187
MARISHA: What?

03:32:12.660 --> 03:32:13.644
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:32:13.644 --> 03:32:14.477
MARISHA: All right.

03:32:16.044 --> 03:32:19.264
You've been here for 20-- you really-- okay, whatever.

03:32:19.264 --> 03:32:21.037
That's fine. Fine.

03:32:23.004 --> 03:32:26.359
What are you going to do, you
know, after you handle all this?

03:32:28.634 --> 03:32:30.192
MATT: "I mean, I--

03:32:32.834 --> 03:32:34.425
"probably try and go home.

03:32:36.605 --> 03:32:39.830
"I hope there's still a home to go back to."

03:32:41.497 --> 03:32:43.724
(exhales)

03:32:43.724 --> 03:32:44.557
MARISHA: Well.

03:32:47.094 --> 03:32:49.274
You're a damn good leader.

03:32:50.260 --> 03:32:51.824
MATT: "Hmm."

03:32:51.824 --> 03:32:54.174
MARISHA: That's clear. People respect you.

03:32:56.194 --> 03:32:57.027
MATT: "Wasn't enough."

03:32:59.254 --> 03:33:00.487
MARISHA: What do you mean?

03:33:10.404 --> 03:33:11.484
MATT: "It's hard to deal with the pressure

03:33:11.484 --> 03:33:13.234
"that's put upon you on a young age,

03:33:14.974 --> 03:33:17.024
"and to fail to meet those expectations.

03:33:17.954 --> 03:33:20.034
"I don't lead because I want;

03:33:20.034 --> 03:33:21.634
"I lead because nobody else will.

03:33:27.278 --> 03:33:29.770
"But I don't know if it's for me."

03:33:33.294 --> 03:33:37.104
MARISHA: Well, it suits you,

03:33:37.104 --> 03:33:38.884
but also do whatever the fuck you want,

03:33:38.884 --> 03:33:39.867
I don't care.

03:33:44.774 --> 03:33:48.024
MATT: "I appreciate your roundabout support, Beauregard."

03:33:48.024 --> 03:33:49.291
MARISHA: You're welcome.

03:33:54.244 --> 03:33:56.334
MATT: "What about you all?

03:33:56.334 --> 03:33:57.984
"You all came here for this event.

03:33:59.900 --> 03:34:01.874
"Once that's done, what's next for you?"

03:34:01.874 --> 03:34:04.541
MARISHA: Well, we're talking about opening up a timeshare,

03:34:04.541 --> 03:34:05.914
maybe a resort or--

03:34:07.084 --> 03:34:09.224
MATT: "Prospecting?"
MARISHA: Returning to pirates.

03:34:10.074 --> 03:34:11.154
MATT: "You were pirates?"

03:34:11.154 --> 03:34:13.134
MARISHA: Well, we had a good run.

03:34:14.164 --> 03:34:15.254
Yeah.

03:34:15.254 --> 03:34:18.984
MATT: "I think we have quite a few pirates in this village

03:34:18.984 --> 03:34:20.984
"that are coming to terms with their old...

03:34:23.764 --> 03:34:25.077
"job titles?"

03:34:28.874 --> 03:34:30.294
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:34:30.294 --> 03:34:33.384
Probably not the most respectable of titles.

03:34:33.384 --> 03:34:34.217
Yeah.

03:34:37.282 --> 03:34:38.465
Feel like you're judging me now.

03:34:38.465 --> 03:34:39.874
You know what?
MATT: "I'm not judging you.

03:34:39.874 --> 03:34:43.724
"I'm saying you are, of the pirates that I've met,

03:34:45.894 --> 03:34:49.014
"those that have embraced that past,

03:34:49.014 --> 03:34:50.764
"some have been a bit prickly today."

03:34:53.827 --> 03:34:55.444
MARISHA: I mean,

03:34:55.444 --> 03:34:57.277
I don't know if I'd say we're pirates,

03:34:57.277 --> 03:34:59.741
but if you're calling us pirates...

03:34:59.741 --> 03:35:00.894
MATT: "You called yourself a pirate."

03:35:00.894 --> 03:35:02.524
MARISHA: Well, I mean, we must be pirates, then!

03:35:02.524 --> 03:35:03.357
Am I right?

03:35:03.357 --> 03:35:06.284
Oh man, if you said it, then we're pirates.

03:35:08.014 --> 03:35:10.134
SAM: How's that flask treating you, Beau?

03:35:10.134 --> 03:35:12.064
MARISHA: It's fucking great.

03:35:12.064 --> 03:35:15.077
I can't believe you've giving this shut up!

03:35:16.444 --> 03:35:18.044
MATT: "Thank you, I do appreciate it.

03:35:20.974 --> 03:35:21.807
"It's strange.

03:35:23.174 --> 03:35:27.714
"I'm deeply, deeply scared

03:35:27.714 --> 03:35:31.451
"and so overwhelmingly excited."

03:35:33.734 --> 03:35:37.804
MARISHA: Well, I mean, you're pretty great,

03:35:40.574 --> 03:35:41.874
so whoever's waiting for you,

03:35:41.874 --> 03:35:45.371
I'm sure they're going to be stoked, you know?

03:35:45.371 --> 03:35:46.204
MATT: "I hope so.

03:35:47.090 --> 03:35:48.784
"I hope they're not too disappointed."

03:35:51.894 --> 03:35:54.454
MARISHA: It's hard to be disappointed when you were sucked

03:35:54.454 --> 03:35:58.854
into a mysterious island

03:35:58.854 --> 03:36:02.121
that was totally overrun by an

03:36:02.121 --> 03:36:05.064
Astral Sea demigod--

03:36:06.244 --> 03:36:08.394
MATT: "You're not wrong."
MARISHA: -- that totally stole your memory.

03:36:08.394 --> 03:36:09.774
It's hard to be mad at that.

03:36:09.774 --> 03:36:11.314
MATT: "I'll lead with that."
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:36:11.314 --> 03:36:12.147
MATT: "I think I should lead with that."

03:36:12.147 --> 03:36:13.594
MARISHA: I think that's an easy lead.

03:36:13.594 --> 03:36:16.114
It's super easy to grasp.

03:36:16.114 --> 03:36:17.074
MATT: "You're right."
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:36:17.074 --> 03:36:18.232
MATT: "You're right.

03:36:21.664 --> 03:36:22.931
"Thank you, all of you,

03:36:26.982 --> 03:36:30.487
"for changing the fortunes of many people,

03:36:33.104 --> 03:36:34.554
"for the better, truly,

03:36:36.544 --> 03:36:38.464
"because at least now they get to choose their life.

03:36:44.674 --> 03:36:45.634
"Anyway."

03:36:45.634 --> 03:36:46.904
MARISHA: Sure you don't want some of this whiskey?

03:36:46.904 --> 03:36:48.334
It's super fucking great.

03:36:49.754 --> 03:36:51.484
I think the flask is a little moldy,

03:36:51.484 --> 03:36:54.004
but don't worry about that.

03:36:54.004 --> 03:36:55.104
SAM: I didn't notice.

03:36:55.104 --> 03:36:57.084
MATT: "I can deal with mold, but I'm good."

03:36:57.084 --> 03:36:57.917
MARISHA: Okay.

03:36:59.414 --> 03:37:01.264
MATT: "I think I'm going to go ahead and finish my rounds

03:37:01.264 --> 03:37:03.272
"and then retire for the evening,

03:37:03.272 --> 03:37:05.874
"and I believe in the morning.

03:37:05.874 --> 03:37:09.234
"I'll be able to take our first batch home."

03:37:09.234 --> 03:37:10.504
LAURA: Wow.

03:37:10.504 --> 03:37:12.104
You can just open up a tree and send them through;

03:37:12.104 --> 03:37:13.514
you don't have to go through yourself?

03:37:13.514 --> 03:37:15.864
MATT: "Yes, correct."
LAURA: That's wonderful.

03:37:15.864 --> 03:37:17.594
SAM: To anywhere in the world?

03:37:17.594 --> 03:37:19.284
MATT: "Well, to anywhere that I've been."

03:37:19.284 --> 03:37:21.634
SAM: Oh.
MATT: "So there are limitations.

03:37:25.517 --> 03:37:28.592
"Hopefully at least I'll get them close to somewhere

03:37:28.592 --> 03:37:30.166
"to their destination.

03:37:32.964 --> 03:37:33.984
"Out of curiosity,

03:37:35.584 --> 03:37:40.414
"it was quite a sum of money that was acquired.

03:37:41.314 --> 03:37:44.506
"Is there any chance, for those
that we're setting a bit free,

03:37:45.944 --> 03:37:50.944
"we could allocate something in their direction?"

03:37:51.364 --> 03:37:54.104
SAM: Are you gently and kindly asking for the money

03:37:54.104 --> 03:37:55.980
that belonged to these people back?

03:37:55.980 --> 03:37:57.704
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:37:57.704 --> 03:38:01.644
MATT: "Well, if memory serves right, not all of this--

03:38:02.724 --> 03:38:04.044
"a lot of this money

03:38:04.044 --> 03:38:06.544
"didn't necessarily belong to some of these people."

03:38:07.504 --> 03:38:09.504
SAM: They just had it.
MATT: "They just had it.

03:38:11.024 --> 03:38:12.684
"But for those that are being let loose

03:38:12.684 --> 03:38:14.984
"into wherever I can bring them,

03:38:14.984 --> 03:38:16.864
"I would like to think they'd at least be comfortable

03:38:16.864 --> 03:38:18.014
"to find their way home."

03:38:19.994 --> 03:38:21.144
SAM: Of course.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:38:22.045 --> 03:38:24.594
SAM: The VO community should be compensated.

03:38:24.594 --> 03:38:27.104
(laughter)

03:38:27.104 --> 03:38:31.344
LAURA: The only thing I wonder about,

03:38:33.894 --> 03:38:35.585
Vilya--

03:38:35.585 --> 03:38:36.885
SAM: Unsung heroes, really.

03:38:41.654 --> 03:38:44.645
LAURA: Everybody seems to be

03:38:44.645 --> 03:38:46.154
getting along peacefully right now

03:38:46.154 --> 03:38:51.004
because the introduction of money hasn't come, right?

03:38:51.004 --> 03:38:52.284
MATT: "Indeed."

03:38:52.284 --> 03:38:57.284
LAURA: I worry, if we were to start handing some out,

03:38:57.834 --> 03:38:59.214
that some of the less

03:39:01.664 --> 03:39:06.664
moral people here might see it as an opportunity.

03:39:07.144 --> 03:39:08.174
MATT: "That's a very valid point."

03:39:08.174 --> 03:39:10.414
TALIESIN: I had a thought about that, actually.

03:39:10.414 --> 03:39:14.094
We'd started discussing this very issue earlier.

03:39:15.594 --> 03:39:19.014
I think it might be advantageous

03:39:19.014 --> 03:39:23.994
to have a little bit of a leaving ceremony.

03:39:23.994 --> 03:39:27.864
I don't think it's healthy to just move forward too quickly.

03:39:31.306 --> 03:39:32.506
I was thinking tomorrow

03:39:33.810 --> 03:39:35.394
of having everyone mark who's leaving,

03:39:35.394 --> 03:39:38.544
mark a stone with their old name and leaving it here.

03:39:39.694 --> 03:39:41.234
And then before they go through the tree,

03:39:41.234 --> 03:39:42.651
we can just hand them

03:39:43.884 --> 03:39:45.434
a little bag of what they need,

03:39:46.664 --> 03:39:48.094
right before we send them on their way

03:39:48.094 --> 03:39:50.344
and no one will ever know, unless they leave.

03:39:51.324 --> 03:39:52.924
The story won't get around.

03:39:52.924 --> 03:39:55.074
We can keep a secret, I think.

03:39:55.074 --> 03:39:56.032
SAM: Sure.
TALIESIN: Can we?

03:39:56.032 --> 03:39:57.094
Have we done that before?

03:39:57.094 --> 03:39:59.844
SAM: No, but we can always turn over a new leaf.

03:39:59.844 --> 03:40:01.684
TALIESIN: Always optimistic.
TRAVIS: First time for everything.

03:40:01.684 --> 03:40:03.564
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)
SAM: Yeah, no, that's a fantastic idea.

03:40:03.564 --> 03:40:05.934
We can hand them a little goodie bag

03:40:05.934 --> 03:40:09.314
and say like, "This is a bag of soil from the island

03:40:09.314 --> 03:40:10.994
"to remember it by," or something.

03:40:10.994 --> 03:40:12.535
TALIESIN: Just a little something to help you remember.

03:40:12.535 --> 03:40:14.094
SAM: Yeah.

03:40:14.094 --> 03:40:15.791
MATT: "All right, we can do that."

03:40:17.604 --> 03:40:19.994
SAM: How much do you think, you know,

03:40:19.994 --> 03:40:22.911
is a good parting amount, you know?

03:40:26.798 --> 03:40:31.798
MATT: "I'm not one for larger commerce

03:40:32.214 --> 03:40:35.755
"and most of my travel has been via

03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:38.721
"cart or tree,

03:40:39.934 --> 03:40:44.724
"or I took a sky ship once."

03:40:44.724 --> 03:40:45.572
LAURA: Oh, that's fun.

03:40:45.572 --> 03:40:46.405
SAM: What's that?

03:40:46.405 --> 03:40:47.664
MATT: "It was a long time ago.

03:40:47.664 --> 03:40:51.624
"They're these massive, beautiful, floating ships in the sky

03:40:51.624 --> 03:40:54.339
"held aloft by some sort of arcane stones.

03:40:55.254 --> 03:41:00.254
"Took me across the seas once to Issylra,

03:41:00.514 --> 03:41:04.141
"on my Aramente a long, long time ago."

03:41:04.141 --> 03:41:05.474
LAURA: Issylra.

03:41:07.174 --> 03:41:09.064
That sounds beautiful.

03:41:09.064 --> 03:41:10.464
MATT: "It's quite cold, actually.

03:41:11.414 --> 03:41:12.247
"A bit tense.

03:41:13.614 --> 03:41:16.008
"But a unique journey, nevertheless.

03:41:19.034 --> 03:41:20.874
"I trust your judgment.

03:41:20.874 --> 03:41:23.726
"I think talking to everybody, about

03:41:26.301 --> 03:41:31.242
"roughly 65, 66 people will be leaving

03:41:32.275 --> 03:41:33.794
"and the rest are to stay.

03:41:34.834 --> 03:41:37.221
"So I'll leave that division to you."

03:41:39.535 --> 03:41:41.127
LAURA: Okay.

03:41:41.127 --> 03:41:42.527
TRAVIS: If I may, before you go,

03:41:43.654 --> 03:41:47.074
do you have anyone to stay with you tonight for security?

03:41:47.074 --> 03:41:49.934
Again, you do possess the sole ability

03:41:49.934 --> 03:41:53.634
to move anyone off this island, whenever they need.

03:41:53.634 --> 03:41:56.104
I can speak from experience that shit happens

03:41:56.104 --> 03:41:57.454
in the middle of the night.

03:41:58.847 --> 03:42:01.134
If you wanted to stay with us,

03:42:02.144 --> 03:42:04.211
we'd be happy to watch your back.

03:42:08.314 --> 03:42:11.374
MATT: "I generally can handle myself in the wilds,

03:42:11.374 --> 03:42:13.024
"but I'm not against some company.

03:42:14.054 --> 03:42:14.887
"If you've room,

03:42:16.264 --> 03:42:18.704
"we've made it comfortable the past few nights, at least."

03:42:20.114 --> 03:42:21.364
TRAVIS: Any objection?

03:42:21.364 --> 03:42:23.495
LAURA: No, that's fine.

03:42:23.495 --> 03:42:24.328
SAM: No.

03:42:25.718 --> 03:42:29.044
ASHLEY: I think that's smart.
MATT: "All right.

03:42:29.044 --> 03:42:29.877
"I'll finish my rounds

03:42:29.877 --> 03:42:31.774
"and I'll meet you for the evening's rest."

03:42:33.204 --> 03:42:36.057
Then she heads back into the crowd.

03:42:38.624 --> 03:42:42.046
LIAM: Wasn't a part of that. Off on the side, Caleb

03:42:43.094 --> 03:42:45.034
quietly sidles over to Yasha,

03:42:45.034 --> 03:42:48.986
who seems to be apart from most people.

03:42:52.364 --> 03:42:54.847
You're over here being awfully quiet.

03:42:57.984 --> 03:42:59.504
ASHLEY: Yeah, I--

03:43:01.704 --> 03:43:03.237
I feel for these people.

03:43:07.224 --> 03:43:09.932
I understand how it feels to have your mind played with,

03:43:09.932 --> 03:43:12.815
I understand how it feels to have your mind played with,

03:43:12.815 --> 03:43:14.123
you know?

03:43:16.132 --> 03:43:17.190
I...

03:43:18.398 --> 03:43:19.823
want to offer comfort to them,

03:43:19.823 --> 03:43:21.742
but I don't really know how.

03:43:24.224 --> 03:43:26.051
LIAM: I can relate to that.

03:43:26.051 --> 03:43:31.011
It was a long day, but a lot was accomplished and

03:43:33.653 --> 03:43:36.671
hard in the morning, but you had a good day.

03:43:38.644 --> 03:43:40.014
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was a good day.

03:43:40.014 --> 03:43:43.714
LIAM: Whatever this is, and more than that,

03:43:43.714 --> 03:43:48.663
there's a little more lightness around your eyes of late.

03:43:48.663 --> 03:43:50.321
there's a little more lightness around your eyes of late.

03:43:51.864 --> 03:43:54.224
ASHLEY: Really?
LIAM: Yeah.

03:43:54.224 --> 03:43:55.974
Sometimes it's hard to see ourselves,

03:43:55.974 --> 03:43:59.204
but that's what you have friends for,

03:43:59.204 --> 03:44:00.370
I'm told.

03:44:02.284 --> 03:44:07.279
ASHLEY: I think I'm starting to realize that.

03:44:10.694 --> 03:44:14.149
LIAM: Listen, I can't give myself this advice,

03:44:15.914 --> 03:44:18.784
I don't think I can convince <i>myself</i>,

03:44:18.784 --> 03:44:21.332
but I can maybe try to convince you.

03:44:22.684 --> 03:44:24.817
You've been doing good for this group,

03:44:26.844 --> 03:44:29.194
you've been doing good for you.

03:44:31.164 --> 03:44:33.126
You have worth and value,

03:44:34.494 --> 03:44:39.057
and a promise of something.

03:44:40.264 --> 03:44:43.614
To be honest, all of this,

03:44:43.614 --> 03:44:48.296
I don't gel with this island very well at all,

03:44:48.296 --> 03:44:51.144
or the gods.

03:44:51.144 --> 03:44:54.494
Most of them seem too big to comprehend.

03:44:54.494 --> 03:44:58.210
Hers, I don't know what to make of that.

03:44:58.210 --> 03:44:59.324
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:44:59.324 --> 03:45:02.054
LIAM: All of it seems illogical to me,

03:45:02.054 --> 03:45:04.787
to happen without rhyme or reason,

03:45:07.204 --> 03:45:09.909
and this island especially is--

03:45:10.835 --> 03:45:11.780
woo!

03:45:11.780 --> 03:45:13.904
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's--

03:45:13.904 --> 03:45:15.187
What a ride.

03:45:22.654 --> 03:45:26.346
LIAM: Anyway, I don't really know why I came over, I just--

03:45:28.990 --> 03:45:31.423
we're the quiet ones, so

03:45:32.714 --> 03:45:36.031
feel like it would do us some good to talk more,

03:45:37.334 --> 03:45:39.409
get out of our own skins a bit.

03:45:41.688 --> 03:45:43.513
ASHLEY: I think that would be good for us.

03:45:46.314 --> 03:45:47.964
Look out for everybody.

03:45:50.564 --> 03:45:51.739
LIAM: Yasha,

03:45:55.814 --> 03:45:58.306
let yourself a little happiness.

03:46:02.974 --> 03:46:05.307
Even if it's helping other people.

03:46:09.499 --> 03:46:10.665
ASHLEY: I'm trying.

03:46:13.160 --> 03:46:14.857
And I think it's working.

03:46:19.194 --> 03:46:20.027
LIAM: Good.

03:46:21.554 --> 03:46:22.387
ASHLEY: Hey.

03:46:27.754 --> 03:46:29.899
I pull him in for a hug.

03:46:35.314 --> 03:46:37.714
Yeah, it's weird,

03:46:37.714 --> 03:46:39.474
but (laughs)

03:46:42.777 --> 03:46:46.871
I just felt like I wanted to give you a hug,

03:46:46.871 --> 03:46:48.294
I hope that's okay.

03:46:48.294 --> 03:46:50.204
LIAM: You are so big.

03:46:50.204 --> 03:46:51.037
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:46:52.105 --> 03:46:53.434
(metal clinks)

03:46:53.434 --> 03:46:55.281
LIAM: That sound was a rib.

03:46:58.394 --> 03:46:59.227
Thank you.

03:47:03.354 --> 03:47:04.187
Thanks.

03:47:06.744 --> 03:47:07.694
ASHLEY: Thank you, Caleb.

03:47:10.064 --> 03:47:11.394
LIAM: I'm going to awkwardly turn around now.

03:47:11.394 --> 03:47:14.608
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to awkwardly just stand here still.

03:47:14.608 --> 03:47:16.546
(laughter)

03:47:16.546 --> 03:47:18.334
LAURA: Off to the side, I see that,

03:47:18.334 --> 03:47:20.124
and then I'm going to, in my sketchbook,

03:47:20.124 --> 03:47:23.784
draw Yasha giving Caleb a hug,

03:47:23.784 --> 03:47:26.574
but behind her, I'm going to have drawn

03:47:26.574 --> 03:47:29.574
her giant feathered wings coming out as well

03:47:29.574 --> 03:47:31.284
and coming down for the hug.

03:47:31.284 --> 03:47:33.292
TRAVIS: Ooh!
ASHLEY: (fake sobbing)

03:47:35.505 --> 03:47:36.338
MATT: Okay.

03:47:38.994 --> 03:47:41.174
Anything else for the evening?

03:47:41.174 --> 03:47:44.277
As the bonfire begins to burn a little lower.

03:47:46.154 --> 03:47:50.774
MARISHA: So many things, but not now.

03:47:50.774 --> 03:47:51.607
MATT: Okay.

03:47:52.984 --> 03:47:54.664
All right.

03:47:54.664 --> 03:47:59.334
Well, eventually you all return to the shed

03:47:59.334 --> 03:48:01.934
you had found earlier, lest you want to find,

03:48:03.004 --> 03:48:05.754
other living quarters, though it seems they're all

03:48:05.754 --> 03:48:08.314
still being occupied by their occupants.

03:48:08.314 --> 03:48:10.134
LIAM: 10 minutes, new dome.
MATT: There you go.

03:48:10.134 --> 03:48:12.314
LAURA: We'll move out tomorrow into something better.

03:48:12.314 --> 03:48:15.394
MATT: Yeah, probably with the people that leave.

03:48:15.394 --> 03:48:17.864
But you settle down.

03:48:17.864 --> 03:48:20.191
Vilya eventually comes and joins.

03:48:21.430 --> 03:48:24.014
Is there anything else you want to before the night's done?

03:48:24.014 --> 03:48:27.444
LIAM: No, but we will move onto something better.

03:48:27.444 --> 03:48:28.764
LAURA: Probably could have taken Vilya's room,

03:48:28.764 --> 03:48:30.924
that would have been smarter.

03:48:30.924 --> 03:48:33.046
MATT: She'd does step in and be like,

03:48:33.046 --> 03:48:34.744
"I mean, you're welcome to stay in my place,

03:48:34.744 --> 03:48:36.154
"but you invited me to yours."

03:48:36.154 --> 03:48:37.564
MARISHA: Oh, is it better?

03:48:37.564 --> 03:48:38.684
MATT: "It's much better than this."

03:48:38.684 --> 03:48:40.064
TRAVIS: We should fuc--

03:48:40.064 --> 03:48:42.114
MARISHA: We should-- I mean, Caleb, your--

03:48:42.114 --> 03:48:43.742
LIAM: 10 minutes, new new dome.

03:48:43.742 --> 03:48:45.300
MARISHA: New dome? Let's do it at your place!

03:48:45.300 --> 03:48:46.924
TRAVIS: New new!
ASHLEY: The new new.

03:48:46.924 --> 03:48:48.265
MATT: She's like, "I was going to mention, this is--

03:48:48.265 --> 03:48:52.081
"this is a bit of a shed. Follow me."

03:48:52.081 --> 03:48:53.894
TRAVIS: We're all about low-viz.

03:48:53.894 --> 03:48:55.336
MATT: She leads you over,

03:48:56.274 --> 03:48:57.434
and she raises her staff.

03:48:57.434 --> 03:49:00.834
You can see that large central tree when you first met her,

03:49:00.834 --> 03:49:03.764
these branches unfurl and lower

03:49:03.764 --> 03:49:06.154
and create this this small platform.

03:49:06.154 --> 03:49:08.327
She steps into it and grabs onto the side and goes,

03:49:08.327 --> 03:49:09.354
"Well, come on!"

03:49:09.354 --> 03:49:12.047
LAURA: Oh, this is way better, what?
ASHLEY: What were we thinking?

03:49:12.047 --> 03:49:13.744
MATT: You all grasp the edges of it,

03:49:13.744 --> 03:49:16.644
and it's a small platform, if you could call it that,

03:49:16.644 --> 03:49:17.524
for everyone to get on,

03:49:17.524 --> 03:49:19.614
but you all hold on to each other in the edges.

03:49:19.614 --> 03:49:22.647
And as everyone's on, she raises her staff and they

03:49:24.426 --> 03:49:27.504
curl up and bring you up to platform.

03:49:27.504 --> 03:49:29.524
At that platform, you can see there are these curtains

03:49:29.524 --> 03:49:32.584
that are hanging, and she lifts her staff,

03:49:32.584 --> 03:49:36.774
flicks it as the platform and the branch meet,

03:49:36.774 --> 03:49:38.433
this gust of wind goes (blows)

03:49:38.433 --> 03:49:40.424
and as it does, the curtain (whooshing)

03:49:40.424 --> 03:49:42.224
and hang up on their own on these

03:49:42.224 --> 03:49:46.356
unseen little brass knobs on the inside.

03:49:46.356 --> 03:49:48.434
On the inside of this hollow of the tree,

03:49:48.434 --> 03:49:51.214
it's a good, like, rounded 20-foot chamber,

03:49:51.214 --> 03:49:56.214
that has a simple bed made of hides and cushions.

03:49:56.964 --> 03:50:00.124
You can see there's some carpets laid out,

03:50:00.124 --> 03:50:03.914
some of them, you know, stained, but they're functional

03:50:03.914 --> 03:50:06.574
and has a nice floral smell,

03:50:07.564 --> 03:50:11.024
with a faint hint of various herbs and lavender.

03:50:11.024 --> 03:50:13.814
And it's simple, but it's very pretty.

03:50:13.814 --> 03:50:15.192
And far more comfortable.
TRAVIS: It's nice, it's okay.

03:50:15.192 --> 03:50:17.364
LAURA: This is really wonderful.

03:50:17.364 --> 03:50:19.034
MATT: She immediately begins to take some of the cushions

03:50:19.034 --> 03:50:20.884
and some of the hides off the bed

03:50:20.884 --> 03:50:23.708
and starts throwing them on the ground.
MARISHA: Caduceus.

03:50:23.708 --> 03:50:26.324
She's got a stove you can make some tea.

03:50:26.324 --> 03:50:27.804
TALIESIN: Do we really want to drink more tea right now?

03:50:27.804 --> 03:50:29.644
MARISHA: I would love some, like, sleepy time tea.

03:50:29.644 --> 03:50:31.071
TALIESIN: All right, putting the kettle back on.

03:50:31.071 --> 03:50:32.312
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:50:32.312 --> 03:50:33.904
LIAM: Give us your best dead people.

03:50:35.404 --> 03:50:38.684
TALIESIN: Getting into the-- That's right, I didn't lose it.

03:50:38.684 --> 03:50:40.384
MARISHA: Yeah, no, caffeine this time, though.

03:50:40.384 --> 03:50:41.604
TALIESIN: No, we're going very mellow.

03:50:41.604 --> 03:50:43.786
Very mellow.
MARISHA: It's camomile.

03:50:43.786 --> 03:50:45.077
TALIESIN: Good for the tummy.

03:50:45.077 --> 03:50:46.348
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:50:46.348 --> 03:50:49.444
(laughter)

03:50:49.444 --> 03:50:51.694
MATT: So you make the new dome in there.

03:50:52.884 --> 03:50:55.324
As Vilya prepares and goes,

03:50:55.324 --> 03:50:56.534
"Very well, rest up.

03:50:56.534 --> 03:50:58.684
"Let me know if you need anything.

03:50:58.684 --> 03:51:03.684
"Tomorrow we begin the new future of Vo,

03:51:04.404 --> 03:51:06.874
"if we even call it that now.

03:51:06.874 --> 03:51:11.874
"And the arrivals of your Traveler."

03:51:12.144 --> 03:51:14.945
LAURA: Yeah-huh, yep, yeah.

03:51:14.945 --> 03:51:15.778
MATT: "All right."

03:51:17.330 --> 03:51:19.964
So you all eventually have some tea.

03:51:19.964 --> 03:51:21.314
Bed down for the night.

03:51:23.434 --> 03:51:25.894
And let yourself in the coming days,

03:51:25.894 --> 03:51:30.154
the rapid approaching and necessary--

03:51:33.353 --> 03:51:35.654
what's the word I'm looking for right now?

03:51:35.654 --> 03:51:38.554
The necessary-- my brain isn't working.

03:51:38.554 --> 03:51:39.604
TRAVIS: Preparations?
MATT: It's Friday.

03:51:39.604 --> 03:51:40.962
Preparations, thank you.
LIAM: Jeez.

03:51:40.962 --> 03:51:42.574
MATT: I know.
TRAVIS: H.

03:51:42.574 --> 03:51:46.624
MATT: The necessary preparations for the event to come.

03:51:46.624 --> 03:51:49.117
That's were going to end in tonight's episode.

03:51:49.117 --> 03:51:51.534
TRAVIS: We've only been leading up to this for?

03:51:51.534 --> 03:51:53.104
MARISHA: Months.
LAURA: I mean!

03:51:53.104 --> 03:51:55.294
SAM: A half of a year, maybe?

03:51:55.294 --> 03:51:56.454
MARISHA: Remember when we thought we were going to

03:51:56.454 --> 03:51:57.947
hit this in Chicago?

03:51:57.947 --> 03:51:59.242
TRAVIS, MATT, ASHLEY, and LAURA: Yeah.

03:51:59.242 --> 03:52:00.661
(laughter)

03:52:00.661 --> 03:52:01.886
TRAVIS: "Let's all wear green!"

03:52:01.886 --> 03:52:03.074
MATT: You guys were like,

03:52:03.074 --> 03:52:07.134
"Man, what if we hit Traveler Con while we're in Chicago?"

03:52:07.134 --> 03:52:08.494
I'm like (high-pitched laugh).

03:52:08.494 --> 03:52:11.277
ASHLEY: That dang cloak took up so much room in the--

03:52:11.277 --> 03:52:12.385
LAURA: I know!

03:52:12.385 --> 03:52:14.335
I love that you just let us do it.

03:52:15.884 --> 03:52:17.454
MATT: Sorry.

03:52:17.454 --> 03:52:18.924
LAURA: Amazing.

03:52:18.924 --> 03:52:19.967
TALIESIN: Wonderfully mean.

03:52:19.967 --> 03:52:23.694
MATT: Ah, well, we'll pick up there next session.

03:52:23.694 --> 03:52:25.924
Thank you guys so much for following us

03:52:25.924 --> 03:52:29.394
for tonight's insanity and weirdness.

03:52:29.394 --> 03:52:31.311
Have a wonderful night, we'll see you soon.

03:52:32.204 --> 03:52:33.134
We love you very much

03:52:33.134 --> 03:52:35.194
and is it Thursday yet?
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:52:35.194 --> 03:52:37.846
MATT: Good night.
ASHLEY: Good night.

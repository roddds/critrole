MATT: Hello everyone, and
welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.256
of Critical Role, where a bunch
of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.880
sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:08.757
ALL: (discordant yelling)
We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:09.880
LIAM: ♪ Oh ♪

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:13.632
(laughter)

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:14.840
MATT: Before we get
into tonight's episode,

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.090
we do have some
announcements to get through.

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:17.799
Beginning with the
first of our sponsors,

00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:19.256
our friends at Ravensburger.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.757
TRAVIS: Ravensburger.
MATT: Sam.

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:23.507
SAM: This episode is sponsored
by our friends at Ravensburger

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:24.923
and the newest in
their award-winning

00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:28.215
Disney Villainous
line, Despicable Plots,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.048
featuring three new villains:

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:31.840
Gaston from Beauty
and The Beast,

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.256
the Horned King from
The Black Cauldron,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.215
and my favorite,
Lady Tremaine from Cinderella.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880
It can be played as
a standalone game

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.006
or as an expansion
for up to six players

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.048
using other Disney Villainous
titles to expand the plot.

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:47.048
And hey, speaking
of despicable plots.

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:47.964
TRAVIS: Uh-huh?

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:50.131
SAM: I'm going to give
the cast an opportunity

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.715
to weave their own
dastardly web of evil,

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:54.507
on my head.

00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:56.673
That's right,
fellow cast members,

00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:58.923
you're going to
give me a haircut.

00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:01.757
Using this map of my head--

00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:02.548
LAURA: No!

00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:03.590
SAM: I would like you to--
MATT: Sam--

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:04.381
LAURA: Sam, stop doing

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:05.507
this to yourself!
LIAM: No, no, no, no, no!

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.006
SAM: We're going to go around
the room, starting with Matt.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.880
LIAM: No.
MATT: No!

00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:10.799
SAM: You call out a number
and say if you want me

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:14.173
to use scissors or a
clipper and how short to go.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:16.880
You guys can work as a
team and give me a mohawk.

00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:19.090
You could focus
on one side only.

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:20.880
You could just do face stuff.

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:23.923
You could do a reverse
mohawk; it's up to you.

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:25.880
LAURA: (horrified) Sam! LIAM:
We do two, seven, and five,

00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:28.465
we can just clear the
whole center of his face.

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:29.507
SAM: Matt, you're up,

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:31.880
the clock has started. MATT: We
could pull some Peter Gabriel
shit.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:32.715
MARISHA: Maybe we do, like--

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:33.507
MATT: No! Like--

00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:34.757
SAM: The clock
has started, Matt.

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:35.840
MATT: Okay, uh--

00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:37.090
ASHLEY: I say you
get rid of all of it.

00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:37.964
Oh, no, this is Matt.
TRAVIS: Start at the chin,

00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:38.923
start at the chin,
start at the chin.

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:40.840
MATT: I'm going to say,
let's see how this,

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:43.673
let's go ahead with five and
let's go for the full Hogan.

00:01:43.697 --> 00:01:44.880
MARISHA: Yes, that's
what I was going to say.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.840
SAM: Five?
MARISHA: Do the full Hogan.

00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:47.507
SAM: Okay, here we go. LIAM: But
how many seconds till he's
bleeding?

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:48.465
MARISHA: You got to do the--

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:51.799
SAM: Okay, okay, be thinking
of your next one, guys.

00:01:51.823 --> 00:01:52.880
Marisha, what do you want?

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:57.256
MARISHA: Okay, if we're
going the full Hogan--

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.215
Oh god.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.173
TALIESIN: One or three I
think, right? SAM: I got this.

00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:01.757
LIAM: Ugh.
TRAVIS: What else is new?

00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:04.423
ASHLEY: Yeah, hold
it up a little.

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:06.632
TALIESIN: This is really
hard to do without a mirror.

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:08.048
Marisha, what you got?

00:02:08.072 --> 00:02:09.880
MARISHA: Three with the razor.

00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:12.880
SAM: Three with the
razor, like full razor?

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:14.799
TRAVIS: What do you mean with
the razor? MARISHA: How do you
mean full razor?

00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:17.215
SAM: Well, I also
have a little guard.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.880
MARISHA: Oh. No, full trimmer.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:19.923
SAM: Full trimmer.
TALIESIN: Yeah, zero.

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:21.006
SAM: Is this three?

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.923
TRAVIS: No, other
side, other side.

00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:24.799
MATT: Wait, no, really, really?

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:26.590
(yells) Sam!
LIAM: (yells)

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:27.715
MATT: What are you doing?!

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.256
LIAM: Oh my god!

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.381
MATT: What the fuck?

00:02:30.405 --> 00:02:32.048
LIAM: Give him the vanity screen

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:33.840
so he can see what he's doing.

00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:35.548
SAM: Oh wait, I have
a mirror, where is it?

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.881
(laughter)

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:39.423
Doesn't matter, it's gone.
Who's next? Taliesin, go.

00:02:39.447 --> 00:02:40.381
LIAM: Oh god.

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:41.880
TALIESIN: If we're
doing, you know?

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:42.840
MARISHA: Yeah.
Clean that up a bit.

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:43.880
TALIESIN: Yeah, clean
that up a little bit.

00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:45.465
MARISHA: Yeah, there
you go, there you go.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.131
TALIESIN: I'm going
to continue onto this.

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:48.632
I'd say, let's do one.

00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:49.799
I'm just going to say--

00:02:49.823 --> 00:02:51.173
LAURA: One's the other
side of your head.

00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:52.548
SAM: Same thing?
TALIESIN: Same thing.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:53.880
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: Use the zero.

00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:55.880
LIAM: Who would
dare do two to him?

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:57.215
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.964
TALIESIN: You can hit
two with the scissors.

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:00.590
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:01.880
All right, Ash?

00:03:01.904 --> 00:03:02.880
LIAM: I hate this.

00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:04.799
LAURA: I don't like it.

00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:06.590
TRAVIS: I do, I kind of like it.

00:03:06.614 --> 00:03:08.880
ASHLEY: There's a part of
me that kind of wants you--

00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:11.632
LAURA: You look like a
D&amp;D character right now,

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:12.880
like a tavern keeper.

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:13.880
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:15.840
ASHLEY: There's a part of
me that kind of wants you

00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:18.173
to take all of it off
except a poof back here.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.507
LIAM: (groans)
LAURA: No, Ashley.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:20.715
ASHLEY: I know, I'm not
going to make you do that.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.507
SAM: I need a number.

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:22.757
(laughter)

00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:24.322
I've also got scissors.

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:27.880
ASHLEY: I'm kind of liking
where this is going, actually.

00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:29.131
TRAVIS: I like where it is.

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:30.256
LAURA: Just leave
it where it is,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.880
because it looks really-- SAM:
Should I clean up anything on
the sides?

00:03:31.904 --> 00:03:33.880
LAURA: I mean, yeah,
fucking clean it up.

00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:34.923
ASHLEY: Yeah, just clean it up.

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:36.880
LAURA: It looks really
awesome right now.

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:38.799
MATT: It is actually
looking pretty great.

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:40.381
TALIESIN: I mean, I wouldn't
have <i>you</i> do this,

00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:41.632
but have someone come in and

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:43.048
deal with the split ends.
ASHLEY: Get these side bits

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:44.006
above your ear.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.423
MARISHA: Your sideburns aren't--
ASHLEY: Pull your ear down.

00:03:45.447 --> 00:03:47.173
MARISHA: -- connected to
anything. SAM: Pull my ear
down?!

00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:48.880
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: You got to get that--

00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:50.256
MARISHA: Yeah, there you go.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.880
LIAM: Jeez.
MARISHA: Down a little bit.

00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:53.465
(laughter)

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.880
LIAM: This is like
a steam from Brazil.

00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:58.548
ASHLEY: <i>That's</i> why
I love it so much.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:03:59.381
SAM: Are we good?

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.632
TRAVIS: Yep.
SAM: Travis? You got anything?

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:01.880
TRAVIS: No, you're good,
you're good. SAM: Laura?

00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:03.590
LIAM: Is there, like--
LAURA: I mean, I like it.

00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:05.880
TRAVIS: You look like
a Mad Max character.

00:04:05.904 --> 00:04:06.880
MARISHA: Look at this
side a little bit.

00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:08.880
You got a little, like a
little right on this side.

00:04:08.904 --> 00:04:10.715
Kind of do the same--
ASHLEY: On your one.

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.048
MARISHA: On your one.
LIAM: Is there a

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:14.090
secret menu, like
at the coffee shop?

00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:16.423
MARISHA: That's it,
that's it, there you go.

00:04:16.447 --> 00:04:17.215
TALIESIN: There you
go, there you go.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.215
LIAM: Well, there's
his buttocks.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.880
MATT: Well, I was going to
say, is there a number seven

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:21.964
and a number eight?

00:04:21.988 --> 00:04:23.131
LIAM: Yeah, I want
the hidden menu.

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:24.880
SAM: I gave you guys a
chance to be villains

00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:26.548
and you were nice.

00:04:26.572 --> 00:04:28.964
TRAVIS: No, it's pretty wild,
what's going on over there.

00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:30.880
ASHLEY: Hold on, look to
the right. Look at me.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.715
SAM: Okay. ASHLEY: You
got to clean up the--

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.381
MARISHA: You've
got a-- your edge.

00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:35.173
TRAVIS: Just go straight up.

00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:38.090
MARISHA: There we go, there
we go, that's the daddy.

00:04:38.114 --> 00:04:39.923
ASHLEY: You had, like,
Giuliani drippy going on.

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.381
LIAM: Get the top and the
front, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:42.405 --> 00:04:43.799
LAURA: Yeah, that's good.
SAM: Oh, look at that.

00:04:43.823 --> 00:04:46.256
LIAM: Now just shave an L on
your chest, and we're done.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.465
MARISHA: Wait, can I? Do you
want to do for the full Hogan?

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.632
SAM: I don't know what that is.
MARISHA: Do a little patch?

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:51.590
MATT: No, put it like
in the sideburns.

00:04:51.614 --> 00:04:53.632
ASHLEY: Handlebar. That's
what I was going to do. Yeah.

00:04:53.656 --> 00:04:54.799
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Hey.

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:56.799
That was despicable.

00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:58.507
(laughter)

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.465
TRAVIS: You look like you
were working on Deadwood.

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:02.880
SAM: Grab a copy of
Despicable Plots right now

00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:07.904
at bit.ly/CRDespicable.

00:05:08.114 --> 00:05:09.880
And for a chance to
win a copy of the game,

00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:12.840
head over to the official
Ravensburger Twitter page--

00:05:12.864 --> 00:05:14.256
LAURA: Ew.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.548
SAM: -- which is
@RavensburgerNA.

00:05:17.572 --> 00:05:19.381
Matt, back to you.

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:21.131
(hair clippers buzzing)
MATT: (laughs)

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:21.923
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:23.880
TALIESIN: I mean,
it's not a bad look.

00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:25.632
LIAM: He looks like
he's headlining

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.215
the Metallica reunion concert.

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:29.215
MATT: Yeah, kind
of, kind of. It's--

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.840
TALIESIN: It's got a little
bit of the Lenny vibe.

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.423
It's got a little
Lenny from Motorhead.

00:05:32.447 --> 00:05:34.131
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah, I dig it.

00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:35.465
SAM: Thanks, guys.
MATT: I dig it.

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:37.298
I really, really
like it, actually.

00:05:37.322 --> 00:05:38.799
All right. Well, thank
you, Ravensburger.

00:05:38.823 --> 00:05:41.423
MARISHA: I also do really
like the little, you know,

00:05:41.447 --> 00:05:42.507
your little ducky shield.

00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:44.340
TRAVIS: I can't wait to
take our meetings tomorrow.

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:47.880
(laughter)

00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:49.465
ASHLEY: But aren't they
so used to Sam just

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:51.548
looking different every Zoom?
MATT: That's true.

00:05:51.572 --> 00:05:53.006
SAM: There's always a Snapchat
filter that can fix it.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.632
MATT: All right!

00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:56.880
Next sponsor!

00:05:56.904 --> 00:05:57.923
Elderwood Academy!

00:05:57.947 --> 00:05:59.006
TRAVIS: Elderwood Academy!

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.632
MATT: Not shaving
any part of myself,

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:05.880
but I do appreciate you guys
and your brand new campaign

00:06:05.904 --> 00:06:08.880

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:13.090

lovers, but also a key ring.

It's amazing stuff.

00:06:23.697 --> 00:06:25.590

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.673
They do amazing work,
enjoy, and stock up.

00:06:44.697 --> 00:06:45.964
MARISHA: Is he sticking
to [inaudible].

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:48.215
LAURA: This is the one
time, like, I'm so happy

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:49.840
we're not still sitting
at the same table

00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:52.006
because I would've had to
fucking be next to him for that.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.590
MATT: That's true.
MARISHA: You would have gotten

00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:54.880
beard clippings on
your character sheet.

00:06:54.904 --> 00:06:57.090
ASHLEY: We would just all
be itchy-- LAURA: So gross.

00:06:57.114 --> 00:06:58.298
ASHLEY: -- with little bits of
hair. LIAM: Yeah, I would be
crawling out of

00:06:58.322 --> 00:06:59.465
my own husk.

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:01.507
(laughter)

00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:02.322
MARISHA: Wow.

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.715
Look at you, doing manual labor.

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:06.590
SAM: Oh well, you know.

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.256
TALIESIN: When this is over,
I will totally shave your head

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.381
the proper way.

00:07:10.405 --> 00:07:12.131
I will take a
razor to your head.

00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:14.880
SAM: What's minimum
wage these days?

00:07:14.904 --> 00:07:16.923
Is it like $40, $50
an hour? I don't know.

00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:18.131
MATT: God, Sam.

00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:19.799
SAM: I don't know
how much people make.

00:07:19.823 --> 00:07:21.507
I don't know what money is.
MATT: (groans)

00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:24.256
TRAVIS: Trying to get it
up, trying to get it up.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.131
MATT: Just leave.

00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:27.799
ASHLEY: "Just leave."

00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:28.923
TRAVIS: "Just leave."

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:31.590
(laughter)

00:07:31.614 --> 00:07:34.381
MATT: And our friends
at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:07:34.405 --> 00:07:35.881
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!
MATT: Thank you so much

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:38.507
for supporting us since the
beginning of the campaign two,

00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:42.298
bring us home as we begin to
climb towards some intensity

00:07:42.322 --> 00:07:44.298
in the near future.

00:07:44.322 --> 00:07:47.340
If you use Discord,
D&amp;D Beyond has a bot named Avrae

00:07:47.364 --> 00:07:49.548
that lets you roll dice,
add your character sheet--

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:50.964
access your character
sheet through it,

00:07:50.988 --> 00:07:54.381
and track initiative
right without ev--

00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:56.381
and track your initiative
without ever leaving Discord.

00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:57.340
There we go.
MARISHA: Nailed it.

00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:00.048
MATT: The words, got
it in one. Hell yeah.

00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:03.881
I was a little distracted by
our gnomish friend over here.

00:08:03.905 --> 00:08:08.006
Check it out at
dndbeyond.link/discord.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.880
That's what it is.

00:08:08.904 --> 00:08:10.880
I've made you in
Warcraft before.

00:08:10.904 --> 00:08:12.298
(laughter)

00:08:12.322 --> 00:08:14.632
Like, I have a gnome
on a server somewhere

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:17.381
that looks just
like you right now.

00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:19.880
MARISHA: Say like,
"Whatcha buyin'?"

00:08:19.904 --> 00:08:21.256
SAM: (cockney accent)
"Whatcha buyin'?"

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.880
(laughter)
MARISHA: Yeah! That's good!

00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:24.507
MATT: I dig it.

00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:26.673
And also thank everyone

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.423
LIAM: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:43.673
Laura and I and everybody
at Critical Role

00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:44.880
are so excited to announce

00:08:44.904 --> 00:08:48.880
our first official
Critical Role novel.

00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.964
(applause and cheering)

00:08:51.988 --> 00:08:54.880
And to reveal its
cover, KITH &amp; KIN,

00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:58.340
written by #1 New York
times bestselling author,

00:08:58.364 --> 00:09:01.423
Marieke Nijkamp.

00:09:01.447 --> 00:09:02.215
Tell us all about it.

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:05.256
LAURA: I'm going to tell
you this original story

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.632
will follow a brand new tale
featuring the cunning ranger,

00:09:09.656 --> 00:09:10.881
Vex'ahlia.
LIAM: I know her!

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:12.964
LAURA: And the cunning
rogue, Vax'ildan.

00:09:12.988 --> 00:09:13.880
LIAM: That's me!

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:15.340
LAURA: And of course, Trinket.

00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:17.090
Years before we
meet Vox Machina.

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:19.131
After the-- oh gosh.

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:21.757
"After leaving the
unwelcoming refuge of Syngorn,

00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.340
"the twins become entangled
in a web spun by the Clasp.

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.381
"And for the first time,
Vex and Vax find themselves

00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:29.799
"on opposite sides of a
conflict that threatens

00:09:29.823 --> 00:09:33.381
"the home they've carried
with each other for years."

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:34.880
LIAM: I mean, there's
things to read.

00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:36.964
It doesn't make sense,
it doesn't make sense.

00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:39.799
The cover is going to be
illustrated by longtime artist,

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:43.590
friend of the show, Nikki Dawes,
@nikkidawesdraws.

00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:45.880
She's amazing,
amazing paintings.

00:09:45.904 --> 00:09:49.090
KITH &amp; KIN will release
on October 26th, 2021.

00:09:49.114 --> 00:09:50.465
LAURA: That's this year!

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:51.880
LIAM and SAM: This year?

00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:53.340
LIAM: Do we still do years?

00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:55.840
TRAVIS: I think so.
ASHLEY: What is time?

00:09:55.864 --> 00:09:57.880
LIAM: You can pre-order
your copy right now

00:09:57.904 --> 00:09:59.423
wherever books are sold.

00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:01.215

00:10:05.864 --> 00:10:09.090
SAM: We have that URL?
We're very forward thinking.

00:10:09.114 --> 00:10:11.880
MARISHA: A new slash?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:10:11.904 --> 00:10:14.173
SAM: Wow. Cool.
MARISHA: You guys, cool.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:19.256
LIAM: Unbelievable,
unbelievable, fantasy novel,
twins, man.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.298
TRAVIS: I'm proud of you
guys! That's so exciting!

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:25.590
MARISHA: Because you talked
about this for so long

00:10:25.614 --> 00:10:29.423
and being the Dragonlance
people and the two of you

00:10:29.447 --> 00:10:31.757
and like the reading the
books and it's the best.

00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:34.090
LIAM: It's all connected.
MARISHA: It's all connected.

00:10:34.114 --> 00:10:34.964
MATT: I love it.

00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:37.173
ASHLEY: I just I want
us to have a bookstore

00:10:37.197 --> 00:10:38.880
and then I will
work at a bookstore

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.923
and wear an apron
and give people

00:10:40.947 --> 00:10:41.923
recommendations. LAURA: And
we need to have a bakery

00:10:41.947 --> 00:10:42.880
in the bookstore.
ASHLEY: And we need to have

00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:44.465
bakery in the bookstore,
obviously. SAM: It's just the
one book, though.

00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:45.880
TRAVIS: Coffee, tea, and
cookies. ASHLEY: I'm just only
going to

00:10:45.904 --> 00:10:47.632
suggest KITH &amp; KIN.
TRAVIS: Cupcakes.

00:10:47.656 --> 00:10:48.923
(laughter)

00:10:48.947 --> 00:10:52.256
ASHLEY: This actually
is a really great read.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.673
SAM: It's on the
Staff Reads shelf.

00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:55.880
ASHLEY: Staff Reads.
It's only KITH &amp; KIN.

00:10:55.904 --> 00:10:57.880
MARISHA: It's the only book
we sell, just displays.

00:10:57.904 --> 00:11:01.215
LIAM: "What about DIY
crafting projects?"

00:11:01.239 --> 00:11:03.006
"Well, KITH &amp; KIN."

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.880
ASHLEY: Well, actually
that's a great scene.

00:11:05.904 --> 00:11:07.381
MATT: Awesome.

00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:09.548
Well, I look forward to
that book and mortar,

00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:11.880
but until then, let's go ahead

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:16.131

MATT: And welcome back.

00:12:56.364 --> 00:12:59.673
So last we left
off: Vox Machina,

00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:02.548
having to tie some loose ends

00:13:02.572 --> 00:13:06.298
before making their
return trek to Eiselcross,

00:13:06.322 --> 00:13:10.173
decided to take a turn
towards the Grove,

00:13:10.197 --> 00:13:13.548
that was once the home
and abode of Caduceus,

00:13:13.572 --> 00:13:16.880
to go and check up
on the Clay clan.

00:13:16.904 --> 00:13:20.880
At that space, you
got to see some folks.

00:13:20.904 --> 00:13:23.340
You got to check up a
bit on these visions

00:13:23.364 --> 00:13:25.256
that were being had.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.632
Some of you had some
conversations, had some
realizations,

00:13:29.656 --> 00:13:34.614
and some shared anxiety
with the adventures to come.

00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:39.507
Towards the end of this
evening's final rest,

00:13:39.531 --> 00:13:43.340
a storm crashing in the
distance, the darkened clouds

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:46.423
and lightless night, the
heavy rain falling all around.

00:13:46.447 --> 00:13:49.298
Yasha went out

00:13:49.322 --> 00:13:52.614
to think on the Storm Lord

00:13:53.864 --> 00:13:56.632
and the connection
they've been steadily

00:13:56.656 --> 00:14:01.298
dancing around since
her escape from Xhorhas.

00:14:01.322 --> 00:14:05.590
In the fits of this vision,
this blasted wasteland

00:14:05.614 --> 00:14:08.880
of broken weapons, in isolation,

00:14:08.904 --> 00:14:11.548
the brewing storm slowly
coming towards you,

00:14:11.572 --> 00:14:13.715
as flashes of lightning
grows stronger and louder.

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:16.114
You run into this storm.

00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:21.715
With the final voice of
the Storm Lord saying,

00:14:21.739 --> 00:14:25.739
"Show me."
(thunder rumbling)

00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:30.507
At which point,

00:14:30.531 --> 00:14:31.632
I'm going to pull
out a battle map.

00:14:31.656 --> 00:14:33.799
(exclaiming)
ASHLEY: What?!

00:14:33.823 --> 00:14:35.923
TRAVIS: I fucking told you!

00:14:35.947 --> 00:14:38.548
SAM: This combat--
Did you think I was lying?

00:14:38.572 --> 00:14:42.090
ASHLEY: Well, part of what you
were saying. SAM: -- was brought
to you by Dwarven Forge.

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:44.590
LIAM: He's going to bring out a
two-foot tall statue for you to
fight.

00:14:44.614 --> 00:14:46.880
SAM: Their exclusive build of
the month for March is available
now.

00:14:46.904 --> 00:14:48.880
Each build includes a custom
encounter, bonus gift card,

00:14:48.904 --> 00:14:50.548
and of course, Dwarven
Forge's hand sculpted

00:14:50.572 --> 00:14:51.880
and hand painted terrain.

00:14:51.904 --> 00:14:53.590
Delve into the sea
cave of secrets at

00:14:53.614 --> 00:14:56.298
http://bit.ly/DwarvenForgeCR.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:14:56.322 --> 00:14:59.423
SAM: Or whatever it
is, there'll be a URL.

00:14:59.447 --> 00:15:00.880
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:15:00.904 --> 00:15:01.880
LIAM: Let's fucking
do this, Johnson.

00:15:01.904 --> 00:15:06.465
MATT: Now, as you hear
the words ringing still,

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:07.757
"Show me."

00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:09.298
(thunder rumbling)

00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:11.215
You see from the clouds above--

00:15:11.239 --> 00:15:12.715
ASHLEY: There's thunder!

00:15:12.739 --> 00:15:15.715
MATT: Yeah. Bits of lightning

00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:17.507
crackle and descend,

00:15:17.531 --> 00:15:21.840
elements of heavy wisps
and fog began to gather

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:26.340
as you see elementals begin
to curl down from above.

00:15:26.364 --> 00:15:30.840
You see three creatures made
of sparking electricity,

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.090
themselves like long
serpents snaking their way

00:15:33.114 --> 00:15:33.881
down from above.

00:15:33.905 --> 00:15:34.923
SAM: ♪ Snaking their way ♪

00:15:34.947 --> 00:15:36.030
ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way ♪

00:15:37.614 --> 00:15:39.923
MATT: As these dangerous,

00:15:39.947 --> 00:15:43.298
burly, storm-like cloud entities

00:15:43.322 --> 00:15:46.465
begin to race down towards you,

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:49.465
massive, angry,
hammer-like fists

00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:51.880
of condensed anger

00:15:51.904 --> 00:15:53.988
racing in your direction.

00:15:55.904 --> 00:15:57.548
I would like the rest of you--
SAM: What?

00:15:57.572 --> 00:16:00.840
MATT: -- to look under your
dice trays for a sheet.

00:16:00.864 --> 00:16:03.215
SAM: Is that what that was?
ALL: What?!

00:16:03.239 --> 00:16:05.880
LAURA: What did you do,
Matthew?! SAM: Is that what that
was?

00:16:05.904 --> 00:16:07.590
Wait, we get to
jaeger these things?

00:16:07.614 --> 00:16:09.215
MATT: You guys--

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:10.423
ASHLEY: I'm going to
fight all of of them?

00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:13.423
MATT: Your job is to fight
the fuck out of Yasha.

00:16:13.447 --> 00:16:16.090
(cheering)
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

00:16:16.114 --> 00:16:18.880
MARISHA: It's like Christmas.
LIAM: Kill her!

00:16:18.904 --> 00:16:20.880
MATT: Marisha,
what have you got?

00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:23.673
MARISHA: I got a storm
spirit, a large elemental.

00:16:23.697 --> 00:16:24.880
MATT: This'll be you.

00:16:24.904 --> 00:16:27.090
MARISHA: That's me.

00:16:27.114 --> 00:16:28.880
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
MATT: Taliesin?

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.715
TALIESIN: I am a
lightning spirit,

00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:31.507
large elemental.

00:16:31.531 --> 00:16:33.090
MATT: That is you. LAURA:
"I am a lightning spirit."

00:16:33.114 --> 00:16:37.923
SAM: I'm also a storm
spirit, unaligned elemental.

00:16:37.947 --> 00:16:38.880
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:39.840
SAM: What can they do?

00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:41.548
LIAM: I'm lightning.

00:16:41.572 --> 00:16:42.880
MATT: There you go.

00:16:42.904 --> 00:16:44.880
LAURA: I am storm.

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:46.840
TALIESIN: I'm going to use some
mean dice for this. MATT: There
you go.

00:16:46.864 --> 00:16:48.673
TRAVIS: And I am
Kord, the Storm Lord.

00:16:48.697 --> 00:16:49.548
No, no, no,

00:16:49.572 --> 00:16:50.880
I'm a lighting spirit.

00:16:50.904 --> 00:16:52.381
(laughter)

00:16:52.405 --> 00:16:54.590
MATT: That'll be you there.
ASHLEY: "I'm, ah, Kord?"

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.090
LIAM: It's just Travis
standing on the map.

00:16:56.114 --> 00:16:58.923
MATT: Yeah, and just
kicking the shit off of it.

00:16:58.947 --> 00:17:01.173
TRAVIS: Grog's like,
"Let's go." (laughs)

00:17:01.197 --> 00:17:04.423
MATT: All righty, I would like
you all to roll initiative.

00:17:04.447 --> 00:17:05.964
(exclaiming)

00:17:05.988 --> 00:17:07.548
MATT: All of you independently.

00:17:07.572 --> 00:17:09.673
TRAVIS: Wow, wow.

00:17:09.697 --> 00:17:11.673
LAURA: I'm only going to
do blue dice for this.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.923
MARISHA: Oh, that's
bad initiative.

00:17:13.947 --> 00:17:15.131
LIAM: Well, lightning
would be fast.

00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:16.880
TALIESIN: It's plus
what for initiative?

00:17:16.904 --> 00:17:18.880
MATT: Dexterity is what
would be, dexterity modifier.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:21.131
SAM: Without revealing
anything to Ashley,

00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:22.590
these guys are no joke.

00:17:22.614 --> 00:17:23.507
TRAVIS: No, they're not.
TALIESIN: No.

00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:24.923
SAM: (laughs)
TRAVIS: No, they're not.

00:17:24.947 --> 00:17:25.904
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:17:27.072 --> 00:17:29.632
ASHLEY: That's
okay, that's okay.

00:17:29.656 --> 00:17:31.880
MATT: You stand there amidst a
crowd-- SAM: We're not talking
will-o'-wisps here.

00:17:31.904 --> 00:17:34.880
MATT: -- of broken
blades of different sizes

00:17:34.904 --> 00:17:36.880
on the ground around you.

00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:38.880
No weapon in your hands.

00:17:38.904 --> 00:17:40.880
25 to 20, anybody?

00:17:40.904 --> 00:17:43.507
SAM: What do we add? Dex?
LAURA: Oh, shit!

00:17:43.531 --> 00:17:45.757
ASHLEY: My first roll
of the night was a one.

00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:47.881
SAM: Matt, for initiative, do we
add dex? ASHLEY: Thankfully, I
have advantage on initiative.

00:17:47.905 --> 00:17:50.215
MATT: Yeah, your dex modifier,
yes. SAM: Okay, cool.

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:51.757
MATT: 20 to 15?

00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:52.840
TALIESIN: 19.

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:53.656
MATT: All righty.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.947
15 to 10?

00:17:56.904 --> 00:17:57.880
SAM: 10.

00:17:57.904 --> 00:17:58.880
ASHLEY: 10.
LAURA: 12.

00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:00.548
MATT: 12, all right.

00:18:00.572 --> 00:18:01.840
TRAVIS: Sam--
MARISHA: Then Laura.

00:18:01.864 --> 00:18:03.840
MATT: Right, because you do
get to have advantage on this

00:18:03.864 --> 00:18:05.823
from your thing, yeah. Good

00:18:07.155 --> 00:18:08.923
ASHLEY: But I rolled
a seven, so, you know.

00:18:08.947 --> 00:18:10.781
It takes me to 10.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.840
MARISHA: Ooh.
MATT: All right.

00:18:13.864 --> 00:18:14.880
SAM: Ooh, boy.

00:18:14.904 --> 00:18:16.423
MATT: 10 to five?

00:18:16.447 --> 00:18:17.548
SAM: And you've got no weapons?

00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:18.799
MATT: Five to one?

00:18:18.823 --> 00:18:20.632
MARISHA: Four.
TRAVIS: Natural one.

00:18:20.656 --> 00:18:21.757
MATT: (laughs) All right.

00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:23.405
ASHLEY: Not my weapons, no.

00:18:24.904 --> 00:18:25.880
LIAM: Bamf your wings out,

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:27.697
going to make some
fried chicken.

00:18:28.904 --> 00:18:32.590
MATT: Liam, you're up
first, right there.

00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:35.215
LIAM: Okay, well,
I will just close

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:38.155
maybe 10 feet closer.

00:18:39.239 --> 00:18:42.381
Yeah, right there, and I'm
just going to kick us off.

00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:46.507
Arc Strike, reach
30 feet. (crackling)

00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.465
MATT: Go ahead and
roll to attack.

00:18:47.489 --> 00:18:49.381
LIAM: Here it comes.

00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:50.423
Natural 20!

00:18:50.447 --> 00:18:52.673
MARISHA: Oh!
TRAVIS: Wow!

00:18:52.697 --> 00:18:54.256
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Wow!

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.548
SAM: We're going to kill Ashley.

00:18:55.572 --> 00:18:58.090
TRAVIS: Well, yeah,
I fucking told you.

00:18:58.114 --> 00:18:59.799
LAURA: Oh no!

00:18:59.823 --> 00:19:03.715
LIAM: It's the snitch reborn.

00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:05.673
MARISHA: That's amazing.

00:19:05.697 --> 00:19:08.173
LIAM: Okay, so that is--
TRAVIS: But I lie.

00:19:08.197 --> 00:19:11.447
LIAM: -- 3d6, so here it comes.

00:19:12.614 --> 00:19:13.381
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:19:13.405 --> 00:19:16.381
LIAM: Plus six, 12. 24.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.964
That is 24 points
of lightning damage.

00:19:18.988 --> 00:19:20.905
TALIESIN: Oh wow.
LAURA: 24 points!

00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:26.757
Oh, no.
TRAVIS: Rage doesn't do shit

00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:28.423
against lightning damage.

00:19:28.447 --> 00:19:29.880
MATT: Wait, 3d6?
ASHLEY: Does it not?

00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:32.880
LIAM: 3d6, it's
what it says here.

00:19:32.904 --> 00:19:34.757
3d6 lightning damage.
SAM: Bludgeoning, piercing.

00:19:34.781 --> 00:19:37.880
MATT: Right, 3d6 couldn't
even add up to 24.

00:19:37.904 --> 00:19:38.880
LIAM: It was a crit.

00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:40.465
MATT: Oh that's right,
it was a crit, I'm sorry.

00:19:40.489 --> 00:19:41.256
LIAM: It's okay.
MATT: My brain. You're right.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.465
LIAM: It's a lot of numbers.
MATT: 24 points of lightning
damage.

00:19:42.489 --> 00:19:43.757
LIAM: A lot of
rolls and numbers.

00:19:43.781 --> 00:19:46.381
MATT: You're right. Sorry,
I was caught in my own math

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:47.590
for a second there.

00:19:47.614 --> 00:19:48.923
ASHLEY: Oofy, okay.

00:19:48.947 --> 00:19:51.632
MATT: All right. As an arc

00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:52.880
shoots out (explosion)

00:19:52.904 --> 00:19:53.923
and you feel the strike hit you

00:19:53.947 --> 00:19:55.715
and your body rocks
with electricity.

00:19:55.739 --> 00:19:57.757
The pain hits you, all your
muscles tense for a second.

00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.881
You almost crumple to one knee,

00:19:59.905 --> 00:20:02.507
breathing heavy, and
you see this serpent

00:20:02.531 --> 00:20:04.964
of electricity arcing
through the air.

00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:06.072
That finish your turn, Liam?

00:20:06.988 --> 00:20:08.298
LIAM: Yep.

00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:09.090
MATT: Taliesin.

00:20:09.114 --> 00:20:11.006
TALIESIN: How far
away am I from--?

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.256
MATT: You are right there.
You're about 25, 30 feet away.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.048
TALIESIN: 25 feet? I'm not
even going to bother moving.

00:20:17.072 --> 00:20:19.757
I'm just going to charge
up another Arc Strike,

00:20:19.781 --> 00:20:21.381
and I'm going to attack
with an Arc Strike.

00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:22.880
MATT: Go ahead and
roll for an attack.

00:20:22.904 --> 00:20:24.072
TALIESIN: All right.

00:20:26.364 --> 00:20:29.757
(whistles) That's a 22 to hit?

00:20:29.781 --> 00:20:31.173
ASHLEY: That hits.

00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:34.823
TALIESIN: It's not--
at least it's not a--

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:38.964
Nine points of lightning damage.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:39.880
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:20:39.904 --> 00:20:41.215
MATT: As soon as you're
reeling from the one hit,

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:42.673
a second one hits
you in the shoulder.

00:20:42.697 --> 00:20:44.381
It doesn't hurt quite much,
but you're now realizing

00:20:44.405 --> 00:20:46.923
just how surrounded you are.

00:20:46.947 --> 00:20:48.006
That finish you turn, Taliesin?

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.090
TALIESIN: Yep,
that's everything.

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:50.880
MATT: Laura, you're up.

00:20:50.904 --> 00:20:52.381
LAURA: Oh god.

00:20:52.405 --> 00:20:53.880
I'm going to--
TRAVIS: Enter!

00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:55.880
LAURA: (laughs)

00:20:55.904 --> 00:21:00.904
I'm going to move
15 feet towards her.

00:21:01.197 --> 00:21:03.632
At least 15 feet
in a straight line.

00:21:03.656 --> 00:21:04.423
I'm going to move

00:21:04.447 --> 00:21:05.507
straight up to her,
MATT: You can get straight

00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:08.423
there to her. LAURA: And I'm
going to slam attack her.

00:21:08.447 --> 00:21:11.465
So I'm going to turn this
into a Battering Ram.

00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:13.715
Did I move 15 feet
before I hit her?

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.548
MATT: Yes, you did, you
moved about 25 feet.

00:21:15.572 --> 00:21:18.673
LAURA: So yeah, this is
a Battering Ram attack.

00:21:18.697 --> 00:21:20.298
So I'm going to try to hit
you with a slam attack.

00:21:20.322 --> 00:21:22.739
MATT: All right.
SAM: Battering ram!

00:21:23.904 --> 00:21:24.864
LAURA: 22?

00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:26.880
ASHLEY: That hits.

00:21:26.904 --> 00:21:29.840
LAURA: Okay. Oh no.
(laughter)

00:21:29.864 --> 00:21:32.880
LAURA: So that's 2d8 bludgeoning
damage plus an additional

00:21:32.904 --> 00:21:34.923
3d6 bludgeoning damage.

00:21:34.947 --> 00:21:36.923
ASHLEY: Holy smokes!

00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:38.880
SAM: Read those stats!

00:21:38.904 --> 00:21:39.964
I think you get more.

00:21:39.988 --> 00:21:43.239
LAURA: Do I really? Plus five.

00:21:44.155 --> 00:21:46.090
Wait, "if you hit
with a slam attack--"

00:21:46.114 --> 00:21:49.048
Oh, and you're pushed
10 feet away from me.

00:21:49.072 --> 00:21:49.880
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

00:21:49.904 --> 00:21:50.880
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:21:50.904 --> 00:21:52.006
LAURA: So 2d8.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.904
(giggles) Oh no.

00:21:55.904 --> 00:21:59.632
MATT: Yeah, you probably wanted
initiative on this round.

00:21:59.656 --> 00:22:00.880
ASHLEY: Would have
been real helpful.

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:02.423
LAURA: So that's 10 plus--

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:03.256
ASHLEY: I seem to roll real low

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.840
on initiative.
LAURA: That's okay, I rolled low

00:22:04.864 --> 00:22:06.423
on my things.

00:22:06.447 --> 00:22:10.173
10 plus-- so that's 16
points of bludgeoning damage.

00:22:10.197 --> 00:22:11.880
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:22:11.904 --> 00:22:13.548
LAURA: And you're pushed
10 feet away from me.

00:22:13.572 --> 00:22:14.364
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:22:15.447 --> 00:22:18.090
MATT: Skidding across
the dirt and the ground,

00:22:18.114 --> 00:22:20.632
but catching yourself as
you stand there in pain.

00:22:20.656 --> 00:22:24.715
LAURA: And I just stand
there and go (whooshing).

00:22:24.739 --> 00:22:26.880
MATT: So Yasha, at
the top of your turn,

00:22:26.904 --> 00:22:29.632
as you're looking
around, you hear

00:22:29.656 --> 00:22:32.923
(crashing, explosion)

00:22:32.947 --> 00:22:35.090
an extreme impact hits the
ground in front of you.

00:22:35.114 --> 00:22:37.799
Your eyes go blind from
the flash of light,

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.632
the ringing hits your ears.

00:22:39.656 --> 00:22:43.673
As you stand there, slowly
taking in the space around you,

00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:45.673
you see on the ground,
this small crater,

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:48.465
and in the center of it, a
blade that looks suspiciously

00:22:48.489 --> 00:22:50.880
like the one that you
borrowed from Lady Kima,

00:22:50.904 --> 00:22:52.880
(electricity crackling)

00:22:52.904 --> 00:22:54.880
energy sparking around it.

00:22:54.904 --> 00:22:56.465
What do you do?

00:22:56.489 --> 00:22:57.923
ASHLEY: It's in front of me?
MATT: Yeah.

00:22:57.947 --> 00:22:58.904
LAURA: Uh oh.

00:22:59.904 --> 00:23:02.322
ASHLEY: I wonder if I'm
going to be able to use it.

00:23:03.197 --> 00:23:05.507
Okay, hold on,
first things first,

00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.880
I'm going to fucking rage.

00:23:06.904 --> 00:23:07.881
MATT: Damn right you are!

00:23:07.905 --> 00:23:09.256
TRAVIS: Go!

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.197
ASHLEY: Jeez, okay, okay.

00:23:13.447 --> 00:23:17.006
Okay, so I'm going to rage
and I'm going to reach out

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.840
and I'm going to try to grab it.

00:23:19.864 --> 00:23:21.090
MATT: As you pull it out,

00:23:21.114 --> 00:23:22.173
it comes out smoothly

00:23:22.197 --> 00:23:24.923
and as it does the
energy arcs off of it.

00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:28.673
And this warm, vibrant
light just emanates

00:23:28.697 --> 00:23:29.880
from you out to about five feet.

00:23:29.904 --> 00:23:32.880
You become this lantern
beacon of holiness,

00:23:32.904 --> 00:23:34.964
holding it in your hand.

00:23:34.988 --> 00:23:39.988
"Show me." (thunder rumbling)

00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:42.880
ASHLEY: Okay, let me see
if I can do this as well.

00:23:42.904 --> 00:23:45.715
SAM: ♪ I'm a battering ram ♪

00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:48.880
ASHLEY: Okay, would that
be considered an action,

00:23:48.904 --> 00:23:49.880
me grabbing the--?
MATT: No.

00:23:49.904 --> 00:23:51.090
ASHLEY: Okay, great.

00:23:51.114 --> 00:23:53.988
Okay, so what I'm
going to do here.

00:23:56.072 --> 00:24:00.881
All right, I'm going to go
to stormy Laura, over here.

00:24:00.905 --> 00:24:02.006
LAURA: Oh no!

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.880
ASHLEY: She's
still moving around

00:24:03.904 --> 00:24:06.298
and I'm going to
take my first slice.

00:24:06.322 --> 00:24:08.048
MATT: Go for it.

00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:09.880
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:24:09.904 --> 00:24:11.823
MATT: Normal
strikes or reckless?

00:24:12.864 --> 00:24:13.880
ASHLEY: Reckless.

00:24:13.904 --> 00:24:16.131
TRAVIS: That's what
I'm talking about!

00:24:16.155 --> 00:24:19.548
ASHLEY: I don't want to use
that one, I'm going to use--

00:24:19.572 --> 00:24:20.799
Ooh! 18.

00:24:20.823 --> 00:24:23.715
LAURA: Oh, that hits me.
That's my armor class.

00:24:23.739 --> 00:24:25.548
ASHLEY: Okay, so 18 plus--
LAURA: Does that means it hits
me?

00:24:25.572 --> 00:24:26.656
That hits me.

00:24:28.572 --> 00:24:30.381
ASHLEY: Do I know if I'm
able to use these stats yet

00:24:30.405 --> 00:24:32.173
for the Holy Avenger?
MATT: For this, you can.

00:24:32.197 --> 00:24:34.507
ASHLEY: Okay, so that would be--

00:24:34.531 --> 00:24:38.548
plus nine, plus 18-- 27.

00:24:38.572 --> 00:24:39.880
MATT: It's a hit.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:24:39.904 --> 00:24:42.923
So can we get these guys here?

00:24:42.947 --> 00:24:44.880
LIAM: ♪ What would
Nydoorin do? ♪

00:24:44.904 --> 00:24:46.880
LAURA: (laughs)

00:24:46.904 --> 00:24:48.880
ASHLEY: Let's use
this one. Okay, 3d6.

00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:51.256
LAURA: Oh, Storm Lord.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.904
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay.

00:24:58.239 --> 00:25:00.799
Oh jeez, my math, my math, okay.

00:25:00.823 --> 00:25:03.572
TRAVIS: These
elementals are crazy.

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:08.131
ASHLEY: 30 points of damage.

00:25:08.155 --> 00:25:10.090
MATT: 30 points of damage
on that first strike.

00:25:10.114 --> 00:25:11.799
LAURA: Okay.

00:25:11.823 --> 00:25:13.590
MATT: The blade
carves through the air

00:25:13.614 --> 00:25:16.423
with this high whining sound.

00:25:16.447 --> 00:25:18.548
As it hits the
elemental, you watch

00:25:18.572 --> 00:25:21.548
the blade barely meets
resistance as it carves through.

00:25:21.572 --> 00:25:23.840
Part of it just apparates.

00:25:23.864 --> 00:25:26.131
So now it's a
lopsided elemental.

00:25:26.155 --> 00:25:28.256
You see its arm begin
to reform in its space,

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.880
but it looks like
it's taken a hit.

00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:30.757
LAURA: Ow.

00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:32.507
MATT: That was your first
attack. MARISHA: (giggles)

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.006
He's got a little flipper now.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.215
ASHLEY: I flip it
around and then

00:25:35.239 --> 00:25:36.215
go to the other side.
LAURA: I'm spinning

00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:38.090
in a circle now instead of--

00:25:38.114 --> 00:25:39.715
ASHLEY: Reckless.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:41.090
ASHLEY: Oof.

00:25:41.114 --> 00:25:42.614
Ugh. Okay.

00:25:44.405 --> 00:25:45.423
21?

00:25:45.447 --> 00:25:46.507
LAURA: That still hits.

00:25:46.531 --> 00:25:47.904
ASHLEY: (exhales) Okay.

00:25:50.864 --> 00:25:52.298
These are the
tiniest little dice.

00:25:52.322 --> 00:25:53.799
MATT: Now Yasha
knows how I feel.

00:25:53.823 --> 00:25:55.673
"21? Oh, that still
hits, okay, okay."

00:25:55.697 --> 00:25:56.880
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:25:56.904 --> 00:25:57.988
MATT: "I just wanted
to double check."

00:25:59.739 --> 00:26:01.823
The little joys.
LAURA: Such a dick. (laughs)

00:26:05.739 --> 00:26:06.923
ASHLEY: 20.

00:26:06.947 --> 00:26:08.923
LAURA: 20 points?
ASHLEY: 20 points.

00:26:08.947 --> 00:26:09.947
LAURA: All right.

00:26:11.364 --> 00:26:12.298
TRAVIS: You're still up?

00:26:12.322 --> 00:26:13.090
LAURA: I'm still up.

00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:15.381
ASHLEY: You're still
up? Okay, and then--

00:26:15.405 --> 00:26:18.364
LAURA: I'm just a
little teeny storm now.

00:26:20.447 --> 00:26:22.507
TALIESIN: A little dust devil?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:22.531 --> 00:26:25.964
MATT: So you bonus
action, action attacks.

00:26:25.988 --> 00:26:27.256
ASHLEY: Bonus action--

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.006
MATT: You've already done
bonus action to rage, yeah.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.423
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, yeah,
what am I thinking?

00:26:30.447 --> 00:26:31.880
Yes, yes, yes, I'm
done, I'm done.

00:26:31.904 --> 00:26:35.880
MATT: Okay, following
Yasha, we have Sam.

00:26:35.904 --> 00:26:37.880
Marisha, you're on deck.

00:26:37.904 --> 00:26:39.423
SAM: What's my backstory?

00:26:39.447 --> 00:26:41.298
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:26:41.322 --> 00:26:43.880
SAM: How did I become
a storm? Was I--?

00:26:43.904 --> 00:26:47.173
MATT: You became a storm
roughly 10 seconds ago.

00:26:47.197 --> 00:26:47.964
SAM: Okay.

00:26:47.988 --> 00:26:49.880
MATT: By the will of the
Storm Lord, you now exist

00:26:49.904 --> 00:26:51.840
and are filled with an
anger you don't understand

00:26:51.864 --> 00:26:53.673
against a creature
you've never met.

00:26:53.697 --> 00:26:55.006
All you know is
you must destroy.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.590
SAM: Okay, okay,
thank you for that.

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:59.090
MATT: No worries. SAM: Now
I'm prepared to make my move.

00:26:59.114 --> 00:27:03.340
I will fly towards her,

00:27:03.364 --> 00:27:05.880
and if I can, hover above.

00:27:05.904 --> 00:27:06.880
MATT: Mm-hmm. You can do that.

00:27:06.904 --> 00:27:08.006
MARISHA: I was very
destructive, then I realized--

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.904
SAM: And I'm going to go
ahead-- sorry, Yasha--

00:27:13.072 --> 00:27:14.632
I'm going to unleash--
ASHLEY: Don't apologize.

00:27:14.656 --> 00:27:16.632
SAM: I'm going to
unleash the Maelstrom.

00:27:16.656 --> 00:27:20.131
MARISHA: Oh! Do it!
ASHLEY: Unleash the Maelstrom.

00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:24.090
SAM: You must make a DC
20 strength saving throw.

00:27:24.114 --> 00:27:25.381
ASHLEY: I have to make
a strength saving throw?

00:27:25.405 --> 00:27:26.531
SAM: Yes.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:27:27.904 --> 00:27:29.673
SAM: Oh, shit.
ASHLEY: Against you?

00:27:29.697 --> 00:27:31.673
SAM: Against the Maelstrom.

00:27:31.697 --> 00:27:33.215
LAURA: Against the Maelstrom.

00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:34.673
SAM: It's a strength
saving throw.

00:27:34.697 --> 00:27:35.840
MATT: Which you are
raging, which I believe

00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:37.673
you get advantage on that?
SAM: Yeah.

00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:38.880
ASHLEY: Yes, so--

00:27:38.904 --> 00:27:40.840
SAM: Better roll good.

00:27:40.864 --> 00:27:42.507
ASHLEY: It's cocked.

00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:43.923
Okay, 23?

00:27:43.947 --> 00:27:45.632
SAM: Ooh, you beat it.

00:27:45.656 --> 00:27:47.880
ASHLEY: (growls)
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:27:47.904 --> 00:27:49.465
ASHLEY: I point
at the Storm Lord.

00:27:49.489 --> 00:27:51.381
(laughter)

00:27:51.405 --> 00:27:53.632
SAM: So now you only take 3d6--

00:27:53.656 --> 00:27:56.548
or it's 6d6 bludgeoning
damage halved, right?

00:27:56.572 --> 00:27:57.364
MATT: Correct.

00:27:58.904 --> 00:28:01.239
SAM: I happen to
have 6d6 right here.

00:28:03.572 --> 00:28:07.340
Okay. Ooh, that's
really good roll.

00:28:07.364 --> 00:28:11.090
Ooh, that's 30
halved, so that's 15.

00:28:11.114 --> 00:28:12.590
TALIESIN: Which is also halved.

00:28:12.614 --> 00:28:14.006
MATT: But it's bludgeoning
and you are raging

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.923
so it's halved again.

00:28:15.947 --> 00:28:16.880
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:28:16.904 --> 00:28:17.880
MATT and SAM: So seven.

00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:18.880
LAURA: Dang.

00:28:18.904 --> 00:28:22.757
SAM: Damn. That's right,
you're not knocked prone,

00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:25.880
you're not pulled towards
me, and that's it, that's it.

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:27.880
You survived the Maelstrom.

00:28:27.904 --> 00:28:30.006
(laughter)

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.507
ASHLEY: I point again
at the Storm Lord.

00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:35.447
SAM: Oh, if I can,
as a bonus action,

00:28:36.904 --> 00:28:38.880
I'm just going to swirl around.

00:28:38.904 --> 00:28:40.340
MATT: Okay, yeah, yeah,
totally, I'll allow it.

00:28:40.364 --> 00:28:42.381
TRAVIS: Do it, do it,
yes, make it your own.

00:28:42.405 --> 00:28:43.465
SAM: I'm going to angrily swirl.

00:28:43.489 --> 00:28:44.799
TRAVIS: Make it your own.

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:45.880
ASHLEY: This is
really good work.

00:28:45.904 --> 00:28:48.465
TRAVIS: Embody that character.
ASHLEY: Really good, like cold
reading.

00:28:48.489 --> 00:28:49.881
(laughter)

00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:51.840
MATT: Awesome, well
done. Marisha, you're up.

00:28:51.864 --> 00:28:52.964
Travis, you're on deck.
MARISHA: I am.

00:28:52.988 --> 00:28:57.381
I don't think I am within
30 feet of her. Am I?

00:28:57.405 --> 00:28:58.632
Can I get up to her?
MATT: You

00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:01.465
can just get up to
her, if you beeline it.

00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:04.548
MARISHA: I'm going
to beeline it.

00:29:04.572 --> 00:29:06.006
ASHLEY: Baby!
LAURA: Work it!

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.298
SAM: Ooh man, you've got a
bunch of storms around you.

00:29:08.322 --> 00:29:10.507
MARISHA: Would that be
considered a straight line

00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:12.673
to where I can
also Battering Ram?

00:29:12.697 --> 00:29:14.090
MATT: You can, yeah.
SAM: ♪ I'm a battering ram ♪

00:29:14.114 --> 00:29:15.988
MARISHA: I'm a battering ram.

00:29:16.904 --> 00:29:20.006
I'm so sorry, I feel so guilty.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.880
I'mma slam into her!

00:29:21.904 --> 00:29:24.880
MATT: Do it, roll
another attack.

00:29:24.904 --> 00:29:28.090
Is there a plus
nines? Is that what--

00:29:28.114 --> 00:29:29.904
Oh, I rolled a natural one.

00:29:30.572 --> 00:29:32.423
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:29:32.447 --> 00:29:34.006
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Good friend.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.799
(laughter)

00:29:35.823 --> 00:29:38.880
MARISHA: Girlfriend Storm
is like, "(sadly) But--!"

00:29:38.904 --> 00:29:41.298
ASHLEY: I'm attracted to
this one, I don't understand.

00:29:41.322 --> 00:29:42.256
MATT: It's the weirdest feeling.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.256
LIAM: I'm not feeling
your commitment in this.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.465
MARISHA: (half-hearted swiping)

00:29:46.489 --> 00:29:48.632
MATT: You're new to being a
storm, it's a little confusing.

00:29:48.656 --> 00:29:50.507
MARISHA: I was just born.

00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:52.923
MATT: You do have a
second strike, I believe.

00:29:52.947 --> 00:29:54.090
MARISHA: Um...

00:29:54.114 --> 00:29:55.799
MATT: Make two slam
attacks in one round.

00:29:55.823 --> 00:29:58.507
MARISHA: Okay, yes.
LAURA: I didn't do that.

00:29:58.531 --> 00:30:00.590
MARISHA: You're right, I
thought the battering ram--

00:30:00.614 --> 00:30:02.590
SAM: Know your character,
Laura, come on.

00:30:02.614 --> 00:30:05.880
Know your spells.
MARISHA: Jeez, read your spells.

00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:08.673
That is a natural 19 for a 28.

00:30:08.697 --> 00:30:09.880
ASHLEY: That hits.

00:30:09.904 --> 00:30:12.131
LAURA: Mine is a 26.

00:30:12.155 --> 00:30:13.256
SAM: Ooh.
ASHLEY: That hits.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.715
MATT: All right, so roll damage.
ASHLEY: They both hit.

00:30:14.739 --> 00:30:15.904
They both hit.

00:30:17.405 --> 00:30:20.840
MARISHA: Okay, that's 11
points of bludgeoning damage.

00:30:20.864 --> 00:30:23.215
LAURA: Mine is-- MATT: Halved
from her, so you take five.

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:24.381
ASHLEY: Okay. LAURA: Nine
points of bludgeoning damage.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:26.880
MATT: Which is not halved
because you raged after her.

00:30:26.904 --> 00:30:28.757
ASHLEY: True, so nine points.
MATT: You got it.

00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:30.880
SAM: How you doing,
how you doing?

00:30:30.904 --> 00:30:32.880
LAURA: Oh no.
ASHLEY: Standing, but.

00:30:32.904 --> 00:30:34.880
LAURA: Oh no. ASHLEY: I'm
okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

00:30:34.904 --> 00:30:36.465
I was already pretty low.
TRAVIS: Yeah, we hadn't taken a
rest yet.

00:30:36.489 --> 00:30:38.880
ASHLEY: We didn't
rest, or I didn't.

00:30:38.904 --> 00:30:40.880
MATT: Okay, so I should
preface this with the fact

00:30:40.904 --> 00:30:42.673
that you would have
been at full hit points

00:30:42.697 --> 00:30:45.548
for this experience, so.

00:30:45.572 --> 00:30:47.590
TRAVIS: Do you know
where you started

00:30:47.614 --> 00:30:50.048
this encounter with hit points?

00:30:50.072 --> 00:30:52.864
ASHLEY: Yes, I was at...

00:30:54.697 --> 00:30:58.048
138,

00:30:58.072 --> 00:31:01.340
and I am usually at 154, so.

00:31:01.364 --> 00:31:03.590
SAM: So whatever you have now--
TRAVIS: Hurts the wizard's
heart.

00:31:03.614 --> 00:31:04.880
SAM: Whatever you have
now, add 16 to it.

00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:06.632
TRAVIS: It just seems
like a distant dream.

00:31:06.656 --> 00:31:08.880
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll just
heal for 16 points.

00:31:08.904 --> 00:31:10.215
MATT: Add 16 to that.

00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:12.673
You got it, all right, that
finishes Marisha's turn.

00:31:12.697 --> 00:31:14.590
Travis, you're up.

00:31:14.614 --> 00:31:17.090
TRAVIS: I will move
forward one square.

00:31:17.114 --> 00:31:19.215
SAM: That's the voice you're
going to use for this character?

00:31:19.239 --> 00:31:20.715
TRAVIS: (high scratchy
voice) I will move forward--

00:31:20.739 --> 00:31:21.590
(laughter)

00:31:21.614 --> 00:31:23.880
TRAVIS: --one squ--
[inaudible noises]

00:31:23.904 --> 00:31:26.632
So that I'm within 30
feet and I will unleash,

00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:27.799
I didn't make this name up,

00:31:27.823 --> 00:31:30.298
Ball Lightning.
SAM: Yeah.

00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:32.880
LAURA: Ball lightning.
TRAVIS: I need you to make a--

00:31:32.904 --> 00:31:34.090
SAM: Stinkiest
kind of lightning.

00:31:34.114 --> 00:31:35.715
TRAVIS: -- dexterity
saving throw.

00:31:35.739 --> 00:31:36.757
ASHLEY: I make a
dexterity saving throw?

00:31:36.781 --> 00:31:37.988
TRAVIS: Yes.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:31:38.988 --> 00:31:40.988
I have advantage on dex.

00:31:42.322 --> 00:31:43.489
Okay.

00:31:44.864 --> 00:31:45.880
18?

00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:48.632
TRAVIS: That's exactly
what you needed to make.

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:50.880
SAM: (scratchy voice) That's
exactly what you needed to make.

00:31:50.904 --> 00:31:52.715
ASHLEY: (scratchy voice)
That's what you need.

00:31:52.739 --> 00:31:56.381
TRAVIS: So you take 11
points of lightning damage.

00:31:56.405 --> 00:31:57.781
TALIESIN: Actually, I don't--

00:31:59.239 --> 00:32:00.507
I don't think that it--

00:32:00.531 --> 00:32:01.632
No, there's no--

00:32:01.656 --> 00:32:03.340
I think it's a safe save.

00:32:03.364 --> 00:32:04.131
TRAVIS: A safe save?

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.880
TALIESIN: Target creature was--

00:32:05.904 --> 00:32:08.572
on a failure they take
2d8 lightning damage.

00:32:09.405 --> 00:32:11.489
There's nothing
about if they save.

00:32:12.739 --> 00:32:15.173
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: On a failure--

00:32:15.197 --> 00:32:16.673
SAM: Oh, that means
that on a success,

00:32:16.697 --> 00:32:18.090
they just don't take--

00:32:18.114 --> 00:32:19.757
MATT: Half damage. TRAVIS: It
says they take half damage.

00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:20.548
TALIESIN: Where?

00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:21.880
TRAVIS: Yep, last line.

00:32:21.904 --> 00:32:24.465
TALIESIN: Oh, okay,
I don't-- all right.

00:32:24.489 --> 00:32:25.840
MATT: Might've been
an older version.

00:32:25.864 --> 00:32:28.006
TALIESIN: I was about to say,
that's not on mine, but okay.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.799
TRAVIS: And it says,
I-- but that's--

00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:31.423
she saved, that's it.

00:32:31.447 --> 00:32:32.880
ASHLEY: 11 damage.
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:32:32.904 --> 00:32:35.656
LAURA: You're the older
version of a lightning--

00:32:36.447 --> 00:32:38.880
TALIESIN: (old man voice) That's
not how they did it in my day.

00:32:38.904 --> 00:32:39.840
TRAVIS: You know what?

00:32:39.864 --> 00:32:43.781
I rolled the wrong
fucking-- wait, a d-- what?

00:32:44.864 --> 00:32:45.881
ASHLEY: d8's, did
you roll sixes?

00:32:45.905 --> 00:32:49.590
TRAVIS: I rolled d6's,
yes, scratch that.

00:32:49.614 --> 00:32:52.590
So put 11 hit points
back in there and instead

00:32:52.614 --> 00:32:53.757
you're only taking--

00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:57.632
MATT: Give that to Taliesin.

00:32:57.656 --> 00:33:00.006
There you go, it's fine,
it's fine. SAM: (laughs)

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.715
TRAVIS: Eight points of damage.

00:33:01.739 --> 00:33:03.090
ASHLEY: Even better, okay.

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:04.880
MATT: Slip it across the floor.

00:33:04.904 --> 00:33:06.632
TRAVIS: I never
roll d4s, that's it.

00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:07.880
MATT: All righty,
finishes Travis' turn.

00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:10.590
Liam, you are up,
with Taliesin on deck.

00:33:10.614 --> 00:33:11.507
LIAM: (sighs)

00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:14.715
MARISHA: Oh, it looped
around, it looped around.

00:33:14.739 --> 00:33:16.715
LIAM: I will back away ten feet,

00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:19.880
and I will also drop
a ball of lightning.

00:33:19.904 --> 00:33:20.840
MATT: Now if I recall
the Ball Lightning

00:33:20.864 --> 00:33:22.215
actually teleported you to her?

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:24.507
TRAVIS: Only on a success. MATT:
Only on a success, you're right.

00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:25.507
All right, so you're
doing it as well?

00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:26.880
LIAM: So I'm backing
away 10 feet,

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:30.298
but also dropping a
ball, that's another

00:33:30.322 --> 00:33:32.215
DC 18 dex save for you.

00:33:32.239 --> 00:33:33.548
MATT: Go for it, Yasha.
LIAM: Yasha.

00:33:33.572 --> 00:33:35.632
SAM: And is that,
just so I'm clear,

00:33:35.656 --> 00:33:37.840
is that just against her--?

00:33:37.864 --> 00:33:39.006
MATT: Just against her.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.880
SAM: Does it hurt
us too or anything?

00:33:40.904 --> 00:33:41.904
TRAVIS: Just her.

00:33:42.864 --> 00:33:44.131
ASHLEY: 23.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:46.507
LIAM: 23 saves.

00:33:46.531 --> 00:33:48.405
On a failure, they take...

00:33:49.322 --> 00:33:51.964
4d6 lightning damage.

00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:53.006
Okay.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.447
MATT: All righty,
so you stay put.

00:33:57.781 --> 00:34:00.465
LIAM: 17, so on a failure, they
take this lightning damage.

00:34:00.489 --> 00:34:04.572
That is 17 points
of lightning damage.

00:34:05.988 --> 00:34:07.964
MATT: You succeeded, right?

00:34:07.988 --> 00:34:10.256
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.
MATT: So half that.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.423
ASHLEY: But it's lightning?

00:34:11.447 --> 00:34:12.215
MATT and TRAVIS: Yes.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.590
ASHLEY: So, but it--?

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:14.381
TRAVIS: It's just the spell.

00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:16.781
ASHLEY: It's just a
spell, okay, I got it.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.048
MATT: All right, that
finish your turn?

00:34:19.072 --> 00:34:20.548
LIAM: That does finish my turn.

00:34:20.572 --> 00:34:21.548
MATT: You got it, all right.

00:34:21.572 --> 00:34:24.823
That brings us to Taliesin.
Laura, you're on deck.

00:34:25.988 --> 00:34:27.656
TALIESIN: Let's see where I am.

00:34:30.364 --> 00:34:31.614
Not going to do that.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.757
I'm going to go for a...

00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:41.173
also a ball lightning attack.

00:34:41.197 --> 00:34:42.880
MATT: Okay.

00:34:42.904 --> 00:34:43.880
LIAM: We can do this, you guys.

00:34:43.904 --> 00:34:45.215
MATT: Make another
dex save, Yasha.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.880
TALIESIN: That's a dex save.

00:34:46.904 --> 00:34:50.614
TRAVIS: (Enya "Orinoco Flow"
melody) ♪ Make it rain, make it
rain, make it rain ♪

00:34:52.114 --> 00:34:52.964
LAURA: Hey, one of
you lightning bitches

00:34:52.988 --> 00:34:54.880
fly up here, we need lightning.

00:34:54.904 --> 00:34:55.880
MARISHA: I know, we get boofs.

00:34:55.904 --> 00:34:57.548
LAURA: I know, we need
lightning up by us.

00:34:57.572 --> 00:34:59.298
Move up close. TRAVIS: Well,
if you would communicate

00:34:59.322 --> 00:35:01.632
with your teammates earlier,
perhaps-- ASHLEY: 14?

00:35:01.656 --> 00:35:04.465
SAM: (hissing)
TRAVIS: ♪ (high-pitched note) ♪

00:35:04.489 --> 00:35:05.340
TALIESIN: That's the dex save?

00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:06.799
ASHLEY: That's my dex save. SAM:
(scratchy voice) Come, come
closer to us.

00:35:06.823 --> 00:35:09.673
TALIESIN: All right,
I'm going to take-- oh.

00:35:09.697 --> 00:35:12.215
MARISHA: Campaign three
character, right there.

TRAVIS: Oh god.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.880
SAM: Just a bunch of clouds.

00:35:14.904 --> 00:35:16.215
TRAVIS: There's blood
coming out of your mouth.

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:17.799
LIAM: This is Jeremy.

00:35:17.823 --> 00:35:20.131

I want to go the brothel.

TALIESIN: Is there an--

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.799
Okay, so I'm going to teleport
to the unoccupied space.

00:35:26.823 --> 00:35:28.006
MATT: Yep.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.256
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.632
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:35:31.656 --> 00:35:32.880
LAURA: Oh, you teleported in?

00:35:32.904 --> 00:35:33.864
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:35:36.364 --> 00:35:37.880
LIAM: Failed save?

00:35:37.904 --> 00:35:39.256
ASHLEY: I failed.
MARISHA: Lightning can--

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.673
TALIESIN: That's 20 points
of lightning damage.

00:35:40.697 --> 00:35:42.340
LAURA: (gasps)

00:35:42.364 --> 00:35:43.632
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

00:35:43.656 --> 00:35:45.840
TRAVIS: No, it's
good when it hits.

00:35:45.864 --> 00:35:48.006
ASHLEY: It's good.
TRAVIS: Ball Lightning is good.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.880
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:35:48.904 --> 00:35:50.799
TRAVIS: And his next attack
is going to be nasty.

00:35:50.823 --> 00:35:52.090
ASHLEY: Okay. MATT: All righty,
finishing Taliesin's turn,

00:35:52.114 --> 00:35:54.880
Laura, you're up and
then it's you, Yasha.

00:35:54.904 --> 00:35:57.423
LAURA: Okay, since I've
got a lightning spirit

00:35:57.447 --> 00:36:01.507
right next to me, I'm going
to slam attack it twice.

00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:03.880
MATT: Go for it, you
do have advantage

00:36:03.904 --> 00:36:06.823
on these attacks since
her last use was reckless.

00:36:09.904 --> 00:36:13.964
LAURA: Okay, so that
is 20 on the first one.

00:36:13.988 --> 00:36:14.964
ASHLEY: That hits.

00:36:14.988 --> 00:36:16.757
LAURA: And--

00:36:16.781 --> 00:36:18.215
Oh, that is a big hit.

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:19.590
Yeah, that definitely
hits on the second.

00:36:19.614 --> 00:36:21.880
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: 16 plus nine.

00:36:21.904 --> 00:36:24.239
So 2d8.

00:36:29.239 --> 00:36:31.215
10 points on the first hit.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:36:31.239 --> 00:36:32.864
MATT: Reduced to five.

00:36:36.904 --> 00:36:38.507
LAURA: Eight points
reduced to-- oh no, nope,

00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:42.340
that's a lie, eight
plus five is 13,

00:36:42.364 --> 00:36:43.904
so six points for the second.

00:36:44.904 --> 00:36:45.880
MATT: Okay, now
you are next to--

00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:46.880
you're adding the
extra lightning damage

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.090
for being next to him?

00:36:48.114 --> 00:36:50.572
Lightning damage
is not halved so--

00:36:51.656 --> 00:36:52.904
SAM: Oh boy!

00:36:54.947 --> 00:36:56.131
Oh boy!

00:36:56.155 --> 00:36:57.590
MATT: What'd you roll
for both of those?

00:36:57.614 --> 00:37:01.840
LAURA: Two on the second, so
add an extra point of damage.

00:37:01.864 --> 00:37:02.632
ASHLEY: Extra point, okay.

00:37:02.656 --> 00:37:05.173
LAURA: One extra point, and one
extra point on the other one

00:37:05.197 --> 00:37:06.880
because I can't
remember what it is.

00:37:06.904 --> 00:37:07.880
MATT: Make it two extra points.

00:37:07.904 --> 00:37:08.880
ASHLEY: Two extra points, okay.
MATT: Just to

00:37:08.904 --> 00:37:09.964
balance it out because we
don't know what that was.

00:37:09.988 --> 00:37:10.880
LAURA: Okay.

00:37:10.904 --> 00:37:12.507
MATT: All right,
Yasha, you're up.

00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:16.881
ASHLEY: Ooh, I am
looking a little rough.

00:37:16.905 --> 00:37:17.880
Okay.

00:37:17.904 --> 00:37:19.880
LAURA: Is she bloodied,
are you bloodied?

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.006
ASHLEY: I'm bloodied.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.715
Okay.

00:37:22.739 --> 00:37:24.590
MATT: You are surrounded
by roaring storms.

00:37:24.614 --> 00:37:27.006
You hear crackling
lightning and angry,

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.507
shouting thunder,
and you are just

00:37:29.531 --> 00:37:31.715
holding this blade as the
darkness rolls around you.

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:32.880
What do you do?

00:37:32.904 --> 00:37:36.256
ASHLEY: Okay, so I
need to get out of here

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.904
even though they're going
to get an opportunity, so...

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:42.423
Wings are coming out.

00:37:42.447 --> 00:37:44.173
TRAVIS: (shouting)
Yes, here it comes!

00:37:44.197 --> 00:37:47.548
ASHLEY: Ready to go,
and I'm going to try

00:37:47.572 --> 00:37:52.572
to just pull myself
up out of their reach.

00:37:52.781 --> 00:37:53.548
MATT: Okay.

00:37:53.572 --> 00:37:55.715
ASHLEY: As much as I can,
but still I know that--

00:37:55.739 --> 00:37:57.548
I know it's going to be
an attack of opportunity.

00:37:57.572 --> 00:37:58.632
MATT: So.

00:37:58.656 --> 00:38:01.173
LAURA: That's four attack of
opportunity. MARISHA: Yeah, four
attacks of opportunities.

00:38:01.197 --> 00:38:02.880
MATT: Three, technically,
because the lightning doesn't
get one.

00:38:02.904 --> 00:38:04.548
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:38:04.572 --> 00:38:07.048
MATT: Do know, as
your wings pop out,

00:38:07.072 --> 00:38:10.715
this does not take your
action, and this dreamscape

00:38:10.739 --> 00:38:13.880
as soon as you will it
to happen, they tear out,

00:38:13.904 --> 00:38:15.673
the bright white wings now,

00:38:15.697 --> 00:38:18.006
the wingspan widely
out, the feathers

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.757
being caught up in
the storms around you

00:38:19.781 --> 00:38:21.632
as the blade still matches you,

00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:24.715
the light now glowing from
it and you and the wings.

00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:26.381
So you still have
action and a move.

00:38:26.405 --> 00:38:27.298
So did you want to fly up?

00:38:27.322 --> 00:38:28.947
ASHLEY: Okay, so yes.

00:38:31.904 --> 00:38:33.298
(frustrated grunt)

00:38:33.322 --> 00:38:35.923
LAURA: (gravelly voice) Show us!

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:37.072
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:38:38.947 --> 00:38:43.173
Yeah, so I'm going to try
to just get above them--

00:38:43.197 --> 00:38:45.799
can they-- can they fly?

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.131
SAM: I'm flying
above you right now.

00:38:47.155 --> 00:38:48.381
ASHLEY: You're flying above me.
MATT: Yes.

00:38:48.405 --> 00:38:50.006
ASHLEY: Oh, so they
can fly as well.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:52.799
Well, okay, fuck, okay.

00:38:52.823 --> 00:38:54.880
(laughter)

00:38:54.904 --> 00:38:57.048
TRAVIS: ♪ Don't let it
stop you go for it ♪

00:38:57.072 --> 00:38:58.632
ASHLEY: That's fine,
I'm just going to fly,

00:38:58.656 --> 00:38:59.964
I'm just going to get up,

00:38:59.988 --> 00:39:02.006
so I know they're going
to have to take their--

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.881
MATT: If you're
going straight up

00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:04.880
then three of them will
get attacks of opportunity.

00:39:04.904 --> 00:39:07.423
ASHLEY: Okay, can I wiggle?

00:39:07.447 --> 00:39:08.880
Can I kind of like--?

00:39:08.904 --> 00:39:10.423
TRAVIS: Wiggle and quiff?

00:39:10.447 --> 00:39:12.173
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Wiggle and quiff?

00:39:12.197 --> 00:39:14.173
So there's four-- four
surrounding me or three?

00:39:14.197 --> 00:39:15.964
MATT: Correct, there are
four surrounding you,

00:39:15.988 --> 00:39:20.423
there are three storm spirits
and one lightning spirit.

00:39:20.447 --> 00:39:25.447
ASHLEY: So can I
wiggle out towards...

00:39:25.904 --> 00:39:28.256
like fly backwards?

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.423
MATT: Like this way?

00:39:29.447 --> 00:39:31.880
ASHLEY: The-- that way?

00:39:31.904 --> 00:39:34.256
Like where I'm getting
away from the--

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.964
MATT: Oh, this way?
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah yeah Yeah.

00:39:35.988 --> 00:39:38.673
MATT: You can, you
will fly up and over

00:39:38.697 --> 00:39:41.173
and you will get attacks of
opportunity from these three.

00:39:41.197 --> 00:39:42.048
SAM: Choke me out!

00:39:42.072 --> 00:39:43.880
ASHLEY: I'm going to get
an attack of opportunity

00:39:43.904 --> 00:39:44.880
from all of them anyway, right?

00:39:44.904 --> 00:39:46.799
MATT: Well, if you're
moving, it's some of them.

00:39:46.823 --> 00:39:47.632
TRAVIS: Or you can stay

00:39:47.656 --> 00:39:48.988
and swing away.
MATT: It's your call.

00:39:50.322 --> 00:39:51.090
ASHLEY: I'm going to
stay and swing away.

00:39:51.114 --> 00:39:52.006
I'm going to stay and swing away

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.715
because those three
attacks of opportunity

00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:54.880
could take me out.

00:39:54.904 --> 00:39:57.048
Okay.
TRAVIS: Fair.

00:39:57.072 --> 00:40:01.090
ASHLEY: All right, so swipe--
MARISHA: Left.

00:40:01.114 --> 00:40:02.840
ASHLEY: Swipe left.

00:40:02.864 --> 00:40:04.880
(laughter)

00:40:04.904 --> 00:40:06.590
I'm going to swipe left.

00:40:06.614 --> 00:40:08.715
MATT: All right,
so to which one?

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.465
The same one you've
attacked previously?

00:40:10.489 --> 00:40:11.880
ASHLEY: Sure.
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:40:11.904 --> 00:40:12.880
MATT: That'd be Laura.

00:40:12.904 --> 00:40:14.590
LAURA: Hit me!
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:40:14.614 --> 00:40:15.381
MATT: Reckless or not?

00:40:15.405 --> 00:40:17.215
ASHLEY: Reckless.
MATT: All right, go for it.

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:18.173
ASHLEY: Ooh, that was a one.

00:40:18.197 --> 00:40:20.781
So thank goodness I'm reckless.

00:40:21.904 --> 00:40:24.256
Ugh, that's not much better.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.880
Or wait, 17?

00:40:26.904 --> 00:40:28.715
LAURA: (whispering)
It doesn't hit.

00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:31.799
MATT: First swing
goes wide, no impact.

00:40:31.823 --> 00:40:34.423
LAURA: It's because I'm
smaller than I used to be.

00:40:34.447 --> 00:40:36.548
(laughter)

00:40:36.572 --> 00:40:38.030
ASHLEY: Okay, attack again.

00:40:39.572 --> 00:40:41.904
Second attack.
Okay, that's better.

00:40:43.864 --> 00:40:46.423
Okay, so 23?

00:40:46.447 --> 00:40:48.904
LAURA: That hits.
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

00:40:50.155 --> 00:40:51.656
come here, you guys.

00:40:55.904 --> 00:40:58.739
I'm going to do Savage Attacker
because that was kind of low.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.531
Make sure I keep the--

00:41:04.947 --> 00:41:05.904
That's better.

00:41:09.781 --> 00:41:13.904
Okay, so-- oh my god, math.

00:41:18.864 --> 00:41:21.881
Okay, so 31 points of damage.

00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:23.131
LAURA: Okay, I'm--

00:41:23.155 --> 00:41:25.173
MATT: Are you adding
the additional

00:41:25.197 --> 00:41:27.298
damage for having your wings
out? LAURA: It doesn't matter
because I'm already down.

00:41:27.322 --> 00:41:30.256
ASHLEY: No, so that's
an additional 14.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.880
MATT: An additional 14
points of radiant damage

00:41:31.904 --> 00:41:32.880
on top of that.

00:41:32.904 --> 00:41:34.423
LAURA: Well, I'm a big zero.

00:41:34.447 --> 00:41:35.256
ASHLEY: Oh, you're out?

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.173
LAURA: But when I hit
zero, I do my action move,

00:41:39.197 --> 00:41:41.880
Exploding Thunder!

00:41:41.904 --> 00:41:44.799
TRAVIS: Oh, you too? Oh shit.

00:41:44.823 --> 00:41:47.632
LAURA: I explode into
a thing of lightning

00:41:47.656 --> 00:41:49.340
and all of you fuckers around me

00:41:49.364 --> 00:41:51.880
take 6d6 bludgeoning damage.

00:41:51.904 --> 00:41:52.923
TRAVIS: 66!?

00:41:52.947 --> 00:41:54.964
LAURA: 6d6.
TRAVIS: Woo!

00:41:54.988 --> 00:41:57.048
MARISHA: Windy, no!

00:41:57.072 --> 00:41:57.923
SAM: (laughs)

00:41:57.947 --> 00:42:00.739
MATT: That's all
of you right there.

00:42:01.656 --> 00:42:03.173
LAURA: So hold on, oh!

00:42:03.197 --> 00:42:04.256
(laughter)

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.548
This is like the
best I've ever--

00:42:05.572 --> 00:42:07.465
ASHLEY: Did you roll all sixes?

00:42:07.489 --> 00:42:09.340
LAURA: Four sixes, so.

00:42:09.364 --> 00:42:12.715
(laughter)
MARISHA: Oh my god!

00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:17.757
LAURA: Plus another six, so
that's-- five times six is 30--

00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:19.673
No, five times six is 30?

00:42:19.697 --> 00:42:20.465
MATT: 30.

00:42:20.489 --> 00:42:21.880
SAM: But we get to
make a dexterity save?

00:42:21.904 --> 00:42:24.131
LAURA: You have to
make a dexterity save.

00:42:24.155 --> 00:42:24.947
MARISHA: Oh.

00:42:26.322 --> 00:42:27.880
TRAVIS: Including Yasha.

00:42:27.904 --> 00:42:29.256
LAURA: Including Yasha.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.757
MARISHA: I failed.

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.632
SAM: I failed as well.
TALIESIN: What's the save?

00:42:32.656 --> 00:42:33.507
LAURA: 18.

00:42:33.531 --> 00:42:35.256
TALIESIN: I failed.
ASHLEY: I failed.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.880
LAURA: Everybody takes 30.

00:42:37.904 --> 00:42:40.298
MATT: Everybody except
for Travis and Liam.

00:42:40.322 --> 00:42:41.757
LAURA: But you're raging.

00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:43.048
SAM: It's bludgeoning
damage, so it's halved.

00:42:43.072 --> 00:42:45.048
ASHLEY: So 15. MATT: And
you failed as well, right?

00:42:45.072 --> 00:42:45.964
ASHLEY: I did.
MATT: Yeah, so you take

00:42:45.988 --> 00:42:47.006
15 points of bludgeoning damage.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.507
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:42:48.531 --> 00:42:49.964
TALIESIN: 30 points of damage?

00:42:49.988 --> 00:42:53.322
LAURA: 30 points of damage and
you're knocked prone, everybody.

00:42:54.823 --> 00:42:55.880
SAM: I'm flying,
what does that mean?

00:42:55.904 --> 00:42:57.465
LAURA: That means
you're on the ground.

00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:59.340
SAM: Ah!

00:42:59.364 --> 00:43:00.781
ASHLEY: Ah!

00:43:01.947 --> 00:43:05.215
LAURA: I went out with a
bang, guys. It felt good.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:07.880
MATT: (explosion) Explosion
knocks you, Yasha,

00:43:07.904 --> 00:43:10.090
onto your ass, the
wings still out,

00:43:10.114 --> 00:43:10.881
catch you during your fall

00:43:10.905 --> 00:43:14.548
but you impact the ground,
your eyes are spinning,

00:43:14.572 --> 00:43:16.781
the pain is throbbing
throughout your body.

00:43:18.904 --> 00:43:21.381
So that finishes your turn
or you still have movement.

00:43:21.405 --> 00:43:23.423
So you can use half your
movement to get up if you want
to.

00:43:23.447 --> 00:43:25.757
ASHLEY: Yes, I will
absolutely do that.

00:43:25.781 --> 00:43:27.880
SAM: We're prone, so
we probably can't do

00:43:27.904 --> 00:43:28.880
an opportunity attack.

00:43:28.904 --> 00:43:29.715
MATT: You're prone, too, right?

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:30.757
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. MATT:
Yeah, so, so you can still,

00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:31.880
none of them get
attacks of opportunity

00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:33.880
because they're all prone.
ASHLEY: Oh my god, amazing,
okay, thank you.

00:43:33.904 --> 00:43:35.880
MATT: So that's half
your movement gone.

00:43:35.904 --> 00:43:39.614
ASHLEY: So, my other half
of the movement, then,

00:43:42.739 --> 00:43:45.048
I'm going to extricate
myself out of that area

00:43:45.072 --> 00:43:45.880
for just a moment.

00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:47.381
MATT: Okay, where abouts?

00:43:47.405 --> 00:43:48.781
ASHLEY: Let me--

00:43:49.904 --> 00:43:52.673
SAM: For some reason I'm
a little itchy, guys.

00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:54.006
LAURA: Do you have
something to change into?

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.904
SAM: No.

00:43:56.114 --> 00:43:56.905
No.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.880
MATT: I have so much caffeine
in my system right now,

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:00.880
let's go!

00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:02.322
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know.

00:44:04.572 --> 00:44:07.006
I still want to be able to
attack them with the sword.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:11.465
So let me just, out of
striking range, maybe

00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:12.632
just backing up a little bit,

00:44:12.656 --> 00:44:13.880
or anywhere that's
out of striking--

00:44:13.904 --> 00:44:14.964
I can't really see where I'm at.

00:44:14.988 --> 00:44:16.006
MATT: You're right there.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:19.673
ASHLEY: Okay, there
we go, yeah, so let me

00:44:19.697 --> 00:44:21.715
go that way a little
bit then, I think.

00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:22.548
MATT: How much movement
do you have left?

00:44:22.572 --> 00:44:23.739
At half speed?

00:44:24.904 --> 00:44:26.880
ASHLEY: Half speed
would be 25 feet.

00:44:26.904 --> 00:44:30.880
MATT: All right, so
you can fly about here.

00:44:30.904 --> 00:44:32.090
TRAVIS: No. No.

00:44:32.114 --> 00:44:33.880
ASHLEY: Great, let
me hang out there.

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:38.239
MATT: Okay, so you will
be flying right up here.

00:44:40.155 --> 00:44:44.090
(wing beats) You watch as she
just darts out of the explosion,

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:45.880
and is up in the air,
holding the blade two-handed,

00:44:45.904 --> 00:44:49.880
wings in the air as up above
her, lightning is striking

00:44:49.904 --> 00:44:52.340
in the dark clouds, flashing
and silhouetting her

00:44:52.364 --> 00:44:53.840
from moment to moment.
SAM: So cool.

00:44:53.864 --> 00:44:55.673
MATT: That finishes your turn.
SAM: How far away is she from us
now?

00:44:55.697 --> 00:44:56.964
ASHLEY: Finishes my turn.

00:44:56.988 --> 00:44:57.923
MATT: Sam, you're up.

00:44:57.947 --> 00:44:59.880
SAM: How far away is she?

00:44:59.904 --> 00:45:00.880
MATT: From you?
SAM: Yeah.

00:45:00.904 --> 00:45:02.256
MATT: You are right there,

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.006
no, sorry, you are
right there, correct?

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.880
SAM: Yeah.

00:45:04.904 --> 00:45:09.572
MATT: So she's about 30
feet from you, 25-30 feet.

00:45:10.905 --> 00:45:11.964
SAM: Please don't
address me as Sam.

00:45:11.988 --> 00:45:13.715
My name is Tempest Cloudburst.

00:45:13.739 --> 00:45:16.322
MATT: Sorry, Tempest Cloudburst,
I'll make a note of that.

00:45:18.656 --> 00:45:21.006
SAM: (awful Italian accent) And
I have decided I am an Italian
storm.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.880
(laughter)

00:45:23.904 --> 00:45:26.298
MARISHA: You're just growing an
identity-- SAM: (Italian accent)
Yes!

00:45:26.322 --> 00:45:28.256
MARISHA: -- over this game.
ASHLEY: Workshopping your
tempest.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.590
SAM: (Italian accent) I use half
of my movement to stand up-eh.

00:45:32.614 --> 00:45:34.006
MATT: There you go.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.880
SAM: And seeing her in the air,

00:45:35.904 --> 00:45:37.880
I will fly a-towards her

00:45:37.904 --> 00:45:40.757
but I can only
a-fly a-15 feet, so.

00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:41.799
MATT: Correct.

00:45:41.823 --> 00:45:44.131
(laughter)

00:45:44.155 --> 00:45:45.904
MATT: So unfortunately
you get about,

00:45:46.781 --> 00:45:49.840
we'll say, there,
flying above your buddy.

00:45:49.864 --> 00:45:50.880
MARISHA: You're on my head.

00:45:50.904 --> 00:45:52.880
SAM: I've already used
my maelstrom attack,

00:45:52.904 --> 00:45:55.215
so I cannot do anything.

00:45:55.239 --> 00:45:56.880
MATT: All right, that
finishes your turn,

00:45:56.904 --> 00:45:58.090
Tempest Cloudburst.

00:45:58.114 --> 00:45:58.880
SAM: Thank you.

00:45:58.904 --> 00:45:59.923
MATT: All right,
Marisha, you're up.

00:45:59.947 --> 00:46:00.881
Travis, you're on deck.

00:46:00.905 --> 00:46:01.880
MARISHA: (low voice) Get off.

00:46:01.904 --> 00:46:05.840
And I shove Tempest
off and stand up.

00:46:05.864 --> 00:46:09.381
(groans loudly) What are arms?

00:46:09.405 --> 00:46:10.799
And then I--

00:46:10.823 --> 00:46:12.423
SAM: It's just your Beau voice.

00:46:12.447 --> 00:46:14.799
(laughter)
MARISHA: Yeah, it's--

00:46:14.823 --> 00:46:16.904
It's just-- yeah. Yeah.

00:46:17.904 --> 00:46:19.405
And then

00:46:20.531 --> 00:46:24.298
I, too, will maelstrom.

00:46:24.322 --> 00:46:27.632
MATT: Okay, all right, so.

00:46:27.656 --> 00:46:29.614
MARISHA: I would
like to maelstrom.

00:46:30.614 --> 00:46:33.423
MATT: So is that a-- which
saving throw for her, strength?

00:46:33.447 --> 00:46:34.465
MARISHA: Uh-huh,

00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:37.340
DC 20.
MATT: Make a strength save.

00:46:37.364 --> 00:46:39.507
LAURA: I didn't even get
to maelstrom before I died.

00:46:39.531 --> 00:46:41.465
SAM: I'm sorry.
MATT: (sympathetic noise)

00:46:41.489 --> 00:46:43.465
MARISHA: This is for Windy.

00:46:43.489 --> 00:46:44.673
ASHLEY: 27?

00:46:44.697 --> 00:46:45.757
MARISHA: Said Beau.

00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:47.173
MATT: Yeah, that'll
work, that'll work.

00:46:47.197 --> 00:46:47.964
SAM: Saves.

00:46:47.988 --> 00:46:52.131
MARISHA: Okay, well, you're
still taking half damage.

00:46:52.155 --> 00:46:53.340
ASHLEY: I still take damage,

00:46:53.364 --> 00:46:55.880
and then halve that
because of raging.

00:46:55.904 --> 00:46:57.673
SAM: One-quarter.
MATT: Quarter damage.

00:46:57.697 --> 00:47:00.673
LIAM: For the Storm Lord.

00:47:00.697 --> 00:47:02.880
MARISHA: Okay,
that's pretty good,

00:47:02.904 --> 00:47:06.215
that's 10, 16, 20, 21.

00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:09.590
So 10 damage, 11 damage,
do you round up or down?

00:47:09.614 --> 00:47:11.215
MATT: Down, to 10 so
five, take five points

00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:12.006
of bludgeoning damage.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.632
MARISHA: Five damage.
SAM: How you doin'?

00:47:13.656 --> 00:47:14.904
ASHLEY: Oof.

00:47:16.904 --> 00:47:18.632
TALIESIN: That's not the one
that hurts everybody around you,
is it?

00:47:18.656 --> 00:47:20.880
ASHLEY: I'm a pre-teen at the
moment. MARISHA: That happens
when we die,

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:22.423
and it just happens.

00:47:22.447 --> 00:47:24.006
MATT: All right, that
finishes your go, Marisha.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.964
Travis, you're up.

00:47:24.988 --> 00:47:26.880
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm this lightning
guy that's right there.

00:47:26.904 --> 00:47:28.048
MATT: You are right there.

00:47:28.072 --> 00:47:31.880
TRAVIS: I'll move
within 30 feet of Yasha,

00:47:31.904 --> 00:47:33.548
just out of the range.

00:47:33.572 --> 00:47:34.340
MATT: So about there.

00:47:34.364 --> 00:47:38.964
TRAVIS: Yep, and I will
send an arc strike towards--

00:47:38.988 --> 00:47:41.548
MATT: You have advantage on this
because she did roll recklessly.

00:47:41.572 --> 00:47:43.340
SAM: Oh noes.

00:47:43.364 --> 00:47:45.880
TRAVIS: That will hit with a 27.

00:47:45.904 --> 00:47:47.465
ASHLEY: That hits.

00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:48.340
TRAVIS: And that will be--

00:47:48.364 --> 00:47:49.131
MATT: Go ahead and
do some damage.

00:47:49.155 --> 00:47:52.256
TRAVIS: Plus an
accumulated charge.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280
I dropped that.

00:47:56.239 --> 00:48:00.739
Yeah, that's 26 points
of lightning damage.

00:48:01.904 --> 00:48:03.131
ASHLEY: I'm unconscious.

00:48:03.155 --> 00:48:04.280
MATT: You are.
ASHLEY: I'm out.

00:48:05.904 --> 00:48:08.880
MATT: But you're also a
14th level zealot barbarian.

00:48:08.904 --> 00:48:10.507
ASHLEY: You better
fucking believe it!

00:48:10.531 --> 00:48:11.298
(laughter)

00:48:11.322 --> 00:48:12.715
SAM: What does that do?

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:15.131
LIAM: Stays up and fights dead.

00:48:15.155 --> 00:48:17.880
MATT: So she is
technically unconscious,

00:48:17.904 --> 00:48:20.673
but the body continues to fight.

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:21.465
SAM: For how long?

00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:22.880
MATT: She doesn't take--

00:48:22.904 --> 00:48:26.256
she doesn't take zero
hit points to heart.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.048
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:48:27.072 --> 00:48:30.215
MATT: With the strike
knocks her, in the air,

00:48:30.239 --> 00:48:34.048
and right as she's about to
fall, the wings come back

00:48:34.072 --> 00:48:35.880
with a fury (wing beats),

00:48:35.904 --> 00:48:37.840
even angrier, blade up.
LAURA: That's so fucking cool.

00:48:37.864 --> 00:48:39.840
MATT: You now see,
where Yasha's eyes

00:48:39.864 --> 00:48:43.757
normally have pupils, have
given way to arcs of lightning

00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:46.465
that now strike out of
both sides of her head,

00:48:46.489 --> 00:48:48.340
going down as her
hair begins to lift.

00:48:48.364 --> 00:48:50.465
The air around her,
that static electricity,

00:48:50.489 --> 00:48:53.880
is now causing it to create
this halo around her.

00:48:53.904 --> 00:48:54.757
All right.

00:48:54.781 --> 00:48:56.173
SAM: You see a little bit
of rain trickling down

00:48:56.197 --> 00:48:57.465
Tempest's legs.

00:48:57.489 --> 00:48:59.632
(laughter)

00:48:59.656 --> 00:49:00.757
TRAVIS: I love
how you said legs,

00:49:00.781 --> 00:49:01.880
but you pointed to your face.

00:49:01.904 --> 00:49:04.632
(laughter)

00:49:04.656 --> 00:49:06.880
MATT: All righty, does that
finish your turn, Travis?

00:49:06.904 --> 00:49:08.880
You got it. Top of the
round. Liam, you are up.

00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:10.131
Taliesin, you're on deck.

00:49:10.155 --> 00:49:14.673
ASHLEY: So should I-- do I
count these damage points?

00:49:14.697 --> 00:49:17.006
Or, I'm just fighting it
basically unconscious?

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.131
MATT: You're just fighting
unconscious right now.

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.590
ASHLEY: Got it. Okay, okay.

00:49:19.614 --> 00:49:22.880
LIAM: All right, my lightning
spirit will crackle up

00:49:22.904 --> 00:49:24.673
to the top of that peak.

00:49:24.697 --> 00:49:25.465
MATT: Up here?

00:49:25.489 --> 00:49:27.904
LIAM: Yep, right there, that
should be within 30 feet,

00:49:29.904 --> 00:49:32.298
and fire off another arc strike.

00:49:32.322 --> 00:49:34.173
MATT: The range is 30 feet?
LIAM: Yep.

00:49:34.197 --> 00:49:36.632
MATT: (crackling)
Just out of range.

00:49:36.656 --> 00:49:37.423
LIAM: Oh, is it, okay.

00:49:37.447 --> 00:49:40.256
MATT: Yeah, just out
of range, if you look--

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.697
going back and measuring here.

00:49:44.947 --> 00:49:46.881
LIAM: It's okay, the 40-foot
distance from the table

00:49:46.905 --> 00:49:49.715
might have messed with my--
MATT: I know, I know.

00:49:49.739 --> 00:49:51.298
SAM: Spatial?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:52.656
MATT: That's fine,

00:49:53.697 --> 00:49:54.880
so it goes wide.
LIAM: Okay.

00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:56.006
TRAVIS: I know it, baby.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.381
MATT: Doesn't quite reach.
LIAM: (vulgar noise)

00:49:58.405 --> 00:49:59.988
MATT: Taliesin, you're up.

00:50:02.405 --> 00:50:06.197
TALIESIN: Let's
see, I'm going to

00:50:07.322 --> 00:50:08.465
get up.

00:50:08.489 --> 00:50:09.656
MATT: All righty.

00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:15.090
TALIESIN: Oh boy, I'm going
to circle around to the left

00:50:15.114 --> 00:50:18.298
and get a nice--
through the storms.

00:50:18.322 --> 00:50:19.090
MATT: Through this
way, you mean?

00:50:19.114 --> 00:50:22.048
TALIESIN: Yeah. I can't
move very far, can I?

00:50:22.072 --> 00:50:23.715
MATT: That's about as far
as you can move right there.

00:50:23.739 --> 00:50:25.840
TALIESIN: Am I still
within 30 feet?

00:50:25.864 --> 00:50:26.632
MATT: You'll find out.

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:29.489
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay,
then I'm going to--

00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:34.880
MATT: Yep, she's
in range for you.

00:50:34.904 --> 00:50:37.173
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going
to do another retribution shot.

00:50:37.197 --> 00:50:38.757
ASHLEY: Wrong pipe.

00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:40.880
MATT: Go for it, with advantage.

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.030
TALIESIN: Oh, with advantage.

00:50:44.697 --> 00:50:46.880
MARISHA: She's like a duck. SAM:
We're drowning her with our
rain!

00:50:46.904 --> 00:50:48.840
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to
say she's drowning in a rain
storm.

00:50:48.864 --> 00:50:50.531
TALIESIN: That's--
what's that to hit?

00:50:51.405 --> 00:50:52.799
ASHLEY: (coughing)

00:50:52.823 --> 00:50:55.173
TRAVIS: Did you do it again?
LIAM: Aim it down the wrong
pipe!

00:50:55.197 --> 00:50:55.964
TALIESIN: 19?

00:50:55.988 --> 00:50:56.880
ASHLEY: I'm just like so amped,

00:50:56.904 --> 00:51:00.090
I'm like drinking all the
things, I have to pee.

00:51:00.114 --> 00:51:01.256
MATT: Yasha.
TALIESIN: 19 to hit?

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.507
MATT: Does 19 hit you?

00:51:02.531 --> 00:51:03.632
ASHLEY: Yeah, yes.

00:51:03.656 --> 00:51:04.423
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:51:04.447 --> 00:51:05.881
ASHLEY: Yes, that hits.

00:51:05.905 --> 00:51:06.880
TALIESIN: That's--

00:51:06.904 --> 00:51:08.880
LAURA: (laughs)

00:51:08.904 --> 00:51:10.673
TALIESIN: 1d12.

00:51:10.697 --> 00:51:11.964
TRAVIS: You have any
reaction things you can do

00:51:11.988 --> 00:51:13.197
as a zealot barbarian?

00:51:14.072 --> 00:51:16.173
MATT: For this,
I don't think so.

00:51:16.197 --> 00:51:17.881
ASHLEY: I don't, I
know I was looking.

00:51:17.905 --> 00:51:22.090
TALIESIN: That's four feet,

00:51:22.114 --> 00:51:23.673
That's four damage.
That's four damage.

00:51:23.697 --> 00:51:25.823
MATT: So you lose a death save.

00:51:26.656 --> 00:51:27.880
SAM: Wait, any damage?

00:51:27.904 --> 00:51:29.880
MATT: Any damage when
you're unconscious,

00:51:29.904 --> 00:51:31.298
(snaps) takes off a death save.

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:32.880
SAM: Oh snap.

00:51:32.904 --> 00:51:34.590
MATT: All right, that
finishes your turn, Taliesin.

00:51:34.614 --> 00:51:36.880
MARISHA: Is it like the
Matrix, if she dies here,

00:51:36.904 --> 00:51:37.715
she dies in real life?

00:51:37.739 --> 00:51:39.507
SAM: No, no it's like
"Nightmare on Elm Street."

00:51:39.531 --> 00:51:40.673
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:51:40.697 --> 00:51:42.006
SAM: If she dies here
she dies in real life.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.673
MARISHA: Yeah, same thing.

00:51:43.697 --> 00:51:45.757
MATT: All right, so, Laura is
out. LAURA: What if she really
died?

00:51:45.781 --> 00:51:46.715
MATT: Yasha.
LIAM: Well, then we

00:51:46.739 --> 00:51:48.381
go to "Weekend at Bernie's."

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:49.880
MATT: Yasha.
ASHLEY: Wait, how do I?

00:51:49.904 --> 00:51:50.715
MATT: Yasha, it's your turn.

00:51:50.739 --> 00:51:52.548
ASHLEY: It's my turn, okay.
MATT: Yeah, what are you doing?

00:51:52.572 --> 00:51:54.006
ASHLEY: Sorry, I was
looking for the death saves.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:55.881
I'll just note that there's one.

00:51:55.905 --> 00:51:56.880
MATT: Yeah, one is spent.

00:51:56.904 --> 00:51:59.340
ASHLEY: I can't find
them, okay, okay.

00:51:59.364 --> 00:52:00.405
Um, okay.

00:52:02.864 --> 00:52:06.572
(exhales) All right, so I...

00:52:07.489 --> 00:52:10.880
in front of me, I'm going
to go for the one, the--

00:52:10.904 --> 00:52:13.507
MATT: Right here?
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:52:13.531 --> 00:52:16.173
MATT: All right, still in
the air, slightly above it.

00:52:16.197 --> 00:52:17.964
ASHLEY: Still in the
air, slightly above it,

00:52:17.988 --> 00:52:18.880
take a swing.

00:52:18.904 --> 00:52:21.090
MATT: All right, so you
move down about five feet,

00:52:21.114 --> 00:52:22.880
big sweeping arc
with your blade,

00:52:22.904 --> 00:52:24.465
go ahead and roll for
attack, reckless or not?

00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:25.423
ASHLEY: Reckless.

00:52:25.447 --> 00:52:26.239
MATT: Go for it.

00:52:27.114 --> 00:52:28.131
ASHLEY: Okay, good.

00:52:28.155 --> 00:52:30.590
Uh, uh, uh--

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:31.880
MATT: This is against--?

00:52:31.904 --> 00:52:34.880
ASHLEY: 28, points of damage.

00:52:34.904 --> 00:52:36.548
MATT: 28, to hit?
ASHLEY: I mean 28 to hit.

00:52:36.572 --> 00:52:37.923
MATT: 28 to hit,
this is against--?

00:52:37.947 --> 00:52:39.880
ASHLEY: I think that's Sam?
MATT: I think it's Sam.

00:52:39.904 --> 00:52:42.632
SAM: (growl) I mean, ey-a.

00:52:42.656 --> 00:52:43.880
(laughter)

00:52:43.904 --> 00:52:44.715
MATT: So I believe
that hits you,

00:52:44.739 --> 00:52:45.904
go ahead and roll damage.

00:52:46.739 --> 00:52:47.881
LAURA: Have you-- oh,
you've taken some damage

00:52:47.905 --> 00:52:49.489
because of me.
SAM: Yes.

00:52:51.114 --> 00:52:52.673
TRAVIS: It's a-me.

00:52:52.697 --> 00:52:54.905
ASHLEY: Savage Attacker
because that was no good.

00:52:56.904 --> 00:52:59.904
Ooh, better, okay, so.

00:53:04.904 --> 00:53:07.823
It's so quiet while
I'm trying to count.

00:53:13.739 --> 00:53:14.572
25.

00:53:15.447 --> 00:53:17.447
MATT: Is this plus your
level, for your radiant?

00:53:18.904 --> 00:53:19.840
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:21.465
TRAVIS: Dude, that
radiant is huge.

00:53:21.489 --> 00:53:24.423
Yeah, I rolled pretty low.

00:53:24.447 --> 00:53:25.923
MATT: Right, I'm saying
the additional 14 points

00:53:25.947 --> 00:53:26.880
for your level.

00:53:26.904 --> 00:53:28.423
ASHLEY: For the
radiant, for the wings.

00:53:28.447 --> 00:53:29.215
MATT: Every turn you
get to do that once

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:31.423
when you have your
wings out, so.

00:53:31.447 --> 00:53:35.256
ASHLEY: Okay, so, (panting)

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.757
39?

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:39.880
25 plus 14, 39?

00:53:39.904 --> 00:53:41.880
MATT: 39 points of
damage to you, Sam.

00:53:41.904 --> 00:53:43.423
SAM: You see a flash of
lightning, then you wait

00:53:43.447 --> 00:53:47.215
one, two, three (explosion).

00:53:47.239 --> 00:53:48.757
You hear a thunder blast

00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:50.131
as I'm destroyed.

00:53:50.155 --> 00:53:51.632
(yelling)

00:53:51.656 --> 00:53:53.880
My family will kill you.

00:53:53.904 --> 00:53:56.548
(laughter)

00:53:56.572 --> 00:53:58.673
LAURA: So that's
6d6 bludgeoning.

00:53:58.697 --> 00:54:01.590
SAM: Oh, I do a cloudburst,
am I close enough to do that?

00:54:01.614 --> 00:54:03.840
MATT: Everybody,
except for Liam.

00:54:03.864 --> 00:54:04.923
SAM: Within 15 feet of me?

00:54:04.947 --> 00:54:05.880
MATT: Yep.

00:54:05.904 --> 00:54:06.840
SAM: Okay.

00:54:06.864 --> 00:54:08.632
MATT: Everybody except for Liam.

00:54:08.656 --> 00:54:10.048
LAURA: Make a dex save.

00:54:10.072 --> 00:54:12.507
SAM: Ooh, big roll.

00:54:12.531 --> 00:54:14.715
Ten, 22--

00:54:14.739 --> 00:54:16.799
LAURA: Do you have to make a dex
save, too? ASHLEY: I don't think
I do.

00:54:16.823 --> 00:54:17.964
SAM: 30.
MATT: You do.

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.381
ASHLEY: I do, actually.

00:54:19.405 --> 00:54:20.423
(laughter)

00:54:20.447 --> 00:54:22.715
SAM: 30 points of
bludgeoning damage,

00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:25.715
make a dex saving throw.

00:54:25.739 --> 00:54:26.757
MARISHA: That's
all of us, right?

00:54:26.781 --> 00:54:29.090
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

00:54:29.114 --> 00:54:30.632
SAM: You save, so
it's half that.

00:54:30.656 --> 00:54:32.006
MATT: So 15 bludgeoning to you.

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.880
MARISHA: Okay.

00:54:32.904 --> 00:54:34.614
MATT: Taliesin?
TALIESIN: I'm dead.

00:54:36.531 --> 00:54:37.632
LAURA: It took you out?

00:54:37.656 --> 00:54:39.298
TRAVIS: Do you explode also?

00:54:39.322 --> 00:54:42.173
TALIESIN: I get
grounded, I just go--

00:54:42.197 --> 00:54:43.881
(laughter)

00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:45.823
TRAVIS: Grounding charge.

00:54:47.114 --> 00:54:48.715
ASHLEY: I failed.

00:54:48.739 --> 00:54:50.507
MATT: All right, so you
take your second death save.

00:54:50.531 --> 00:54:51.923
ASHLEY: Another
death save, okay.

00:54:51.947 --> 00:54:52.880
MATT: All right.

00:54:52.904 --> 00:54:54.173
ASHLEY: You have
three total, right?

00:54:54.197 --> 00:54:56.340
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: Three total, yep.

00:54:56.364 --> 00:54:57.256
SAM: Did I hit you?

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.673
MATT: So that was your
first strike, what's up?

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.880
LAURA: Does that mean
she's knocked prone, too?

00:55:02.904 --> 00:55:05.131
MATT: No, she never
falls unconscious.

00:55:05.155 --> 00:55:06.880
SAM: Did I hit Travis
when I blew up?

00:55:06.904 --> 00:55:08.880
MARISHA: The exploding thunder.

00:55:08.904 --> 00:55:09.880
MATT: Oh, and you as well, yes.

00:55:09.904 --> 00:55:11.632
TRAVIS: Oh, how many points
was it? SAM: It was 30.

00:55:11.656 --> 00:55:13.904
Unless you make a dex 18 save.

00:55:15.572 --> 00:55:16.880
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:55:16.904 --> 00:55:18.006
MATT: Damn.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:19.757
LAURA: The bludgeoning
damage and be knocked prone

00:55:19.781 --> 00:55:20.548
if you fail.

00:55:20.572 --> 00:55:21.381
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Okay.

00:55:21.405 --> 00:55:22.465
ASHLEY: So would I fall?

00:55:22.489 --> 00:55:24.964
MATT: So you
<i>would</i> fall prone.

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.632
SAM: So would Travis.

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.904
MATT: So you fall to the ground.

00:55:29.904 --> 00:55:31.548
SAM: I'm sorry, not Travis,

00:55:31.572 --> 00:55:32.964
Cyclone.
MATT: You take...

00:55:32.988 --> 00:55:35.256
one point of bludgeoning
damage because you were--

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.880
well, no, you would
have been five feet up,

00:55:36.904 --> 00:55:38.173
so you wouldn't have been
enough to take any damage,

00:55:38.197 --> 00:55:39.215
so you're fine.

00:55:39.239 --> 00:55:40.880
But you are prone.
ASHLEY: I am prone.

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:42.964
MATT: You moved five feet, so
your speed would normally be 50?

00:55:42.988 --> 00:55:43.880
Right?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:55:43.904 --> 00:55:45.880
MATT: That's 45, in
order to get back up

00:55:45.904 --> 00:55:49.905
you have to half
that, we'll say to 20.

00:55:51.239 --> 00:55:52.215
But you still have
a second attack.

00:55:52.239 --> 00:55:53.880
ASHLEY: I know.

00:55:53.904 --> 00:55:54.964
SAM: Get it.

00:55:54.988 --> 00:55:55.880
LAURA: Get it.

00:55:55.904 --> 00:55:58.340
ASHLEY: I'm just wondering
if I should heal myself.

00:55:58.364 --> 00:55:59.465
SAM: Can you heal yourself?

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:00.880
ASHLEY: I can.

00:56:00.904 --> 00:56:02.215
SAM: Would that take-- would
that restore a death save?

00:56:02.239 --> 00:56:03.880
MATT: It's an action,
which you cannot do,

00:56:03.904 --> 00:56:04.880
because you already used
your action to attack.

00:56:04.904 --> 00:56:06.673
ASHLEY: Yeah, because I've
already used it, okay.

00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:09.799
Fuck it, sorry. I'm
going to attack.

00:56:09.823 --> 00:56:12.548
MATT: All right, which
one are you going after?

00:56:12.572 --> 00:56:14.215
ASHLEY: Let's go for that guy.

00:56:14.239 --> 00:56:15.757
MARISHA: No.
MATT: Which guy?

00:56:15.781 --> 00:56:16.964
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry.
MATT: There's two guys.

00:56:16.988 --> 00:56:18.548
ASHLEY: The floofy.

00:56:18.572 --> 00:56:19.799
MATT: Right here?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:56:19.823 --> 00:56:20.757
MATT: All right, yeah,
you have enough movement.

00:56:20.781 --> 00:56:21.880
TRAVIS: The soft serve?
ASHLEY: The soft serve.

00:56:21.904 --> 00:56:23.465
MATT: So you get back
up off the ground,

00:56:23.489 --> 00:56:24.880
your feet are still
dangling in the air

00:56:24.904 --> 00:56:26.131
as the wings, (flapping)

00:56:26.155 --> 00:56:27.880
and you swoop in to
swing your second strike

00:56:27.904 --> 00:56:30.173
towards Marisha.
MARISHA: Barry.

00:56:30.197 --> 00:56:32.340
I'm naming him Barry.

00:56:32.364 --> 00:56:34.840
His full name is
Low Barometric Pressure,

00:56:34.864 --> 00:56:36.381
but it's Barry for short.
ASHLEY: Fuck.

00:56:36.405 --> 00:56:38.173
Sorry, I'm cursing a lot.
MATT: Tempest Cloudburst is gone

00:56:38.197 --> 00:56:39.823
but we have Barry on the field.

00:56:41.988 --> 00:56:44.173
ASHLEY: Oh, wait.

00:56:44.197 --> 00:56:45.757
15?

00:56:45.781 --> 00:56:48.131
MARISHA: To hit me?
ASHLEY: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:49.215
19?

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.006
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits.

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:51.880
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:56:51.904 --> 00:56:52.880
MATT: This is just
standard damage roll,

00:56:52.904 --> 00:56:53.923
you do not get the
additional radiant,

00:56:53.947 --> 00:56:54.880
because you only do
that once per round.

00:56:54.904 --> 00:56:55.864
ASHLEY: Got it, okay.

00:57:01.904 --> 00:57:03.880
I already did Savage
Attacker, right, on this turn?

00:57:03.904 --> 00:57:05.614
MATT: You did.
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

00:57:10.572 --> 00:57:12.298
15 points of damage.

00:57:12.322 --> 00:57:15.381
MARISHA: That is
exactly my hit points,

00:57:15.405 --> 00:57:17.715
which means I essplode.

00:57:17.739 --> 00:57:18.864
SAM: Oh no.

00:57:20.364 --> 00:57:21.964
MATT: Which gets you as well.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

00:57:21.988 --> 00:57:24.048
MATT: So I'd like
you both to roll

00:57:24.072 --> 00:57:24.964
dexterity saving throws.

00:57:24.988 --> 00:57:26.715
And you go ahead and
roll damage there, Barry.

00:57:26.739 --> 00:57:27.507
MARISHA: (low, slow voice) Okay.

00:57:27.531 --> 00:57:28.572
MATT: Buddy.

00:57:29.864 --> 00:57:30.923
LAURA: Be bad if you didn't--

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:32.090
TRAVIS: Natural one.

00:57:32.114 --> 00:57:34.197
ASHLEY: That'll be interesting.

00:57:35.739 --> 00:57:37.880
LAURA: You have
to roll above 18.

00:57:37.904 --> 00:57:39.131
ASHLEY: You have to
roll above an 18?

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:40.090
MARISHA: Okay.

00:57:40.114 --> 00:57:42.964
TRAVIS: I literally rolled a
natural one on the dex save.

00:57:42.988 --> 00:57:44.131
MATT: There's a balance.

00:57:44.155 --> 00:57:45.590
TRAVIS: I don't have
a lot of hit points.

00:57:45.614 --> 00:57:47.673
LAURA: But you get advantage
on dex saves, right?

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.507
ASHLEY: Yeah. TRAVIS: I've
only been hit by my own people.

00:57:49.531 --> 00:57:51.340
MARISHA: 21 total again.

00:57:51.364 --> 00:57:52.757
TRAVIS: 21 total what?

00:57:52.781 --> 00:57:53.590
MARISHA: Bludgeoning damage.

00:57:53.614 --> 00:57:56.880
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ, I
only had 20 hit points.

00:57:56.904 --> 00:57:58.423
MARISHA: Oh no!

00:57:58.447 --> 00:57:59.465
TRAVIS: You killed me.

00:57:59.489 --> 00:58:00.964
(laughter)

00:58:00.988 --> 00:58:02.781
ASHLEY: Thank you, baby!

00:58:03.904 --> 00:58:06.632
TRAVIS: I only got hurt
by all you fuckers.

00:58:06.656 --> 00:58:08.131
ASHLEY: Wait, so who's left?

00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:09.904
MATT: Liam is untouched.

00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:13.340
But Ashley, did you roll?
Because you were in the radius
too.

00:58:13.364 --> 00:58:14.131
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

00:58:14.155 --> 00:58:17.880
SAM: Oh, I don't like
this, I don't like this.

00:58:17.904 --> 00:58:19.531
MARISHA: (low, slow
voice) I'm sorry.

00:58:22.405 --> 00:58:23.197
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:58:24.405 --> 00:58:25.904
Oh good, okay.

00:58:28.489 --> 00:58:29.280
22.

00:58:30.531 --> 00:58:31.465
SAM: She saves.
MATT: That's a success,

00:58:31.489 --> 00:58:33.548
but you still take half damage.

00:58:33.572 --> 00:58:35.215
ASHLEY: So I'm
still taking damage.

00:58:35.239 --> 00:58:36.880
MATT: So third
death saving throw.

00:58:36.904 --> 00:58:38.632
You are dead.

00:58:38.656 --> 00:58:39.880
ASHLEY: I'm dead.

00:58:39.904 --> 00:58:40.880
MATT: But you're still up.

00:58:40.904 --> 00:58:42.880
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:58:42.904 --> 00:58:45.799
MATT: Because that's
what your ability does.

00:58:45.823 --> 00:58:47.131
ASHLEY: Rage after death.

00:58:47.155 --> 00:58:48.880
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Because I'm raging.

00:58:48.904 --> 00:58:51.799
MATT: She is a dead
spirit, flying.

00:58:51.823 --> 00:58:54.947
ASHLEY: If I weren't
raging, I'd be donezos.

00:58:56.114 --> 00:58:58.423
MATT: When the rage
ends, we'll find out.

00:58:58.447 --> 00:59:01.423
Well, nevertheless,
that finishes that go.

00:59:01.447 --> 00:59:03.799
Travis is gone,
everyone else is gone,

00:59:03.823 --> 00:59:04.715
Liam, it's your turn.

00:59:04.739 --> 00:59:07.048
LIAM: Well, I guess Shock
Hudson will close the distance.

00:59:07.072 --> 00:59:10.715
(laughter)

00:59:10.739 --> 00:59:12.048
MATT: Right there?
SAM: He's so handsome.

00:59:12.072 --> 00:59:13.715
LIAM: As close as he can get.

00:59:13.739 --> 00:59:15.590
(laughter)
MATT: It gets you about there.

00:59:15.614 --> 00:59:16.880
LIAM: Yeah.

00:59:16.904 --> 00:59:18.880
ASHLEY: I just stop
and I do the Matrix.

00:59:18.904 --> 00:59:20.507
TRAVIS: He has a fedora.

00:59:20.531 --> 00:59:21.964
MATT: Just come--
all right, go for it.

00:59:21.988 --> 00:59:22.880
TRAVIS: You and me kid.

00:59:22.904 --> 00:59:26.673
LIAM: Winner takes
all, arc strike!

00:59:26.697 --> 00:59:27.465
Ka-kow!

00:59:27.489 --> 00:59:28.739
MATT: You do have advantage.

00:59:31.904 --> 00:59:33.880
LIAM: 22 to hit.

00:59:33.904 --> 00:59:34.880
ASHLEY: That hits.

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:36.880
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

00:59:36.904 --> 00:59:38.632
LIAM: (whooshing)

00:59:38.656 --> 00:59:41.256
LAURA: Oh no.
ASHLEY: The little chains!

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.964
Oh my god.

00:59:42.988 --> 00:59:44.923
LIAM: 12 points of
electric damage.

00:59:44.947 --> 00:59:45.880
SAM: What does that do?

00:59:45.904 --> 00:59:48.880
MATT: You are still dead.

00:59:48.904 --> 00:59:49.880
It's your turn, Yasha.

00:59:49.904 --> 00:59:50.881
SAM: (laughs) What?

00:59:50.905 --> 00:59:52.215
LAURA: What does it mean?

00:59:52.239 --> 00:59:54.048
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: She's extra dead.

00:59:54.072 --> 00:59:55.197
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

00:59:57.405 --> 00:59:58.197
SAM: Super dead.

00:59:58.988 --> 01:00:03.590
ASHLEY: I'm going to look to
make sure Storm Lord's watching,

01:00:03.614 --> 01:00:04.507
which I'm sure he is.

01:00:04.531 --> 01:00:05.298
SAM: (laughs) He's distracted.

01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:06.090
(laughter)

01:00:06.114 --> 01:00:07.256
MATT: He's checking his
Twitter, he's like--

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.840
ASHLEY: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:00:08.864 --> 01:00:09.781
MATT: Good job.

01:00:11.239 --> 01:00:12.048
TALIESIN: Swipe right.

01:00:12.072 --> 01:00:14.381
LAURA: Dad! Dad, look at me!

01:00:14.405 --> 01:00:16.923
ASHLEY: I'm going to take
a swing, or get up closer,

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.757
a little closer, and--
LIAM: (monster growling)

01:00:19.781 --> 01:00:20.923
MATT: Arcing up.

01:00:20.947 --> 01:00:22.632
Blade down, go ahead and
roll for your attacks.

01:00:22.656 --> 01:00:24.507
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:26.006
Ooh, cocked.

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.881
Cocked, okay, I'm not going to
roll that. LAURA: Ooh, cocked.

01:00:28.905 --> 01:00:31.548
MATT: That there's real cocked.
LAURA: That one's cocked.

01:00:31.572 --> 01:00:34.173
ASHLEY: Okay, that's good.

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.799
But reckless, let me
see if I can get a 20.

01:00:36.823 --> 01:00:37.823
No, okay.

01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:40.880
26.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:43.048
LIAM: That does hit.
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:44.904
MATT: Full damage on
this first strike.

01:00:46.739 --> 01:00:47.905
ASHLEY: It's cocked.

01:00:53.364 --> 01:00:56.465
I'm going to roll Savage
Attacker because that wasn't
great.

01:00:56.489 --> 01:00:58.988
(groans) Okay.

01:01:01.697 --> 01:01:02.489
17.

01:01:10.072 --> 01:01:11.364
29, 30, 31, 32.

01:01:13.114 --> 01:01:14.298
35, this is so embarrassing,

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:15.507
counting with my fingers
while everybody's watching.

01:01:15.531 --> 01:01:17.923
TRAVIS: Barbarian counting is
tough. MATT: No, we all do it.
Yeah.

01:01:17.947 --> 01:01:19.298
LIAM: 35?
ASHLEY: 35.

01:01:19.322 --> 01:01:20.923
LIAM: That is the exact
number of hit points I have.

01:01:20.947 --> 01:01:22.715
MATT: No shit!
(exclaiming)

01:01:22.739 --> 01:01:26.131
LIAM: But you take four
points of lightning damage

01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:29.757
from the Retribution
Shock as I (screeching).

01:01:29.781 --> 01:01:30.904
MATT: Indeed, you are,

01:01:33.904 --> 01:01:38.173
with the final blow struck,
the final foe scattered.

01:01:38.197 --> 01:01:40.423
The rage still
pumping in your veins,

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:43.239
your consciousness
barely present.

01:01:44.823 --> 01:01:46.880
Comes around to your turn.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:49.072
As the rage is subsiding,
what do you do?

01:01:53.656 --> 01:01:54.697
ASHLEY: I rage again.

01:01:55.905 --> 01:01:57.173
MATT: Okay. ASHLEY: Wait,
wait, wait, what did you say?

01:01:57.197 --> 01:01:58.880
I'm sorry.
MATT: I said

01:01:58.904 --> 01:01:59.880
it's coming to your next turn.

01:01:59.904 --> 01:02:00.880
What are you doing this turn?

01:02:00.904 --> 01:02:01.715
At the end of this turn,

01:02:01.739 --> 01:02:04.423
unless you are attacking
or being attacked,

01:02:04.447 --> 01:02:06.090
you will fall out of your rage.

01:02:06.114 --> 01:02:07.880
ASHLEY: And I'll die.
MATT: Yes.

01:02:07.904 --> 01:02:11.298
ASHLEY: So I want
to continue my rage.

01:02:11.322 --> 01:02:12.090
MATT: Okay.

01:02:12.114 --> 01:02:14.173
ASHLEY: So I'll rage again.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:14.988
MATT: Okay.

01:02:16.697 --> 01:02:18.114
ASHLEY: (sighs) And

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:25.739
I want to try to

01:02:29.781 --> 01:02:32.090
fly up to where I think
the Storm Lord is.

01:02:32.114 --> 01:02:34.673
Get closer to him so I can
be eye to eye with him.

01:02:34.697 --> 01:02:36.215
MATT: Okay.

01:02:36.239 --> 01:02:37.381
You glance up into the sky

01:02:37.405 --> 01:02:40.632
and you can see
the clouds rolling,

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:41.880
but the face isn't present.

01:02:41.904 --> 01:02:43.715
It's not on the
surface as it once was.

01:02:43.739 --> 01:02:45.715
You just see the storm.

01:02:45.739 --> 01:02:46.880
(whooshing)

01:02:46.904 --> 01:02:48.423
You start flying up
as fast as you can,

01:02:48.447 --> 01:02:50.904
60 feet, you're not
sure how high up it is.

01:02:51.823 --> 01:02:53.923
30 feet flying up,
finishes your round.

01:02:53.947 --> 01:02:55.381
End of your next turn,
what are you doing?

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:56.864
ASHLEY: I'm keeping going.

01:02:59.239 --> 01:03:00.799
MATT: Even higher
up into the air.

01:03:00.823 --> 01:03:01.880
SAM: Did you rage or something?

01:03:01.904 --> 01:03:02.880
ASHLEY: Just raging.
(whooshing)

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:05.173
MATT: How many rages
do you have left?

01:03:05.197 --> 01:03:08.423
ASHLEY: I have, well--

01:03:08.447 --> 01:03:12.614
What I have had since
this was considered a--

01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:16.715
LIAM: Full tank of gas.
ASHLEY: A full-time. (laughs)

01:03:16.739 --> 01:03:18.048
MATT: You would have
had full rages--

01:03:18.072 --> 01:03:20.298
ASHLEY: Full rages, okay,
so I think I've used--

01:03:20.322 --> 01:03:21.757
TRAVIS: Three?

01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:22.880
ASHLEY: Two?
TALIESIN: Two.

01:03:22.904 --> 01:03:24.298
MATT: Two at this point.

01:03:24.322 --> 01:03:27.381
ASHLEY: Two at this point,
so I have three left.

01:03:27.405 --> 01:03:28.880
MATT: Okay.

01:03:28.904 --> 01:03:32.489
So you continue up, double
move by dashing, I assume?

01:03:33.904 --> 01:03:35.465
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

01:03:35.489 --> 01:03:38.880
(whooshing) Sword out,
heading towards the storm,

01:03:38.904 --> 01:03:40.632
and the faster you go,

01:03:40.656 --> 01:03:44.840
the immensity of the sky above
you begins to come into view

01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:48.006
as it just slowly
begins to approach.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:51.173
It's further than you thought,
but you're getting closer.

01:03:51.197 --> 01:03:52.072
Next round.

01:03:52.947 --> 01:03:55.590
ASHLEY: Great, because I want
to fly to the center of it.

01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:58.173
MATT: Okay, so you just
keep coasting upwards,

01:03:58.197 --> 01:04:01.173
slowly spiraling as your
wings take you up higher

01:04:01.197 --> 01:04:03.090
and higher. (surging)

01:04:03.114 --> 01:04:04.881
The flashes of
light all around you

01:04:04.905 --> 01:04:08.173
as the blood is pumping through
your veins (blood pumping)

01:04:08.197 --> 01:04:10.656
in the back of your
head, that furious,

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.590
Zealot-like rage,
keeping you conscious

01:04:15.614 --> 01:04:17.947
in spite of the
fact that your body

01:04:19.114 --> 01:04:22.548
is falling into its end.

01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:24.947
You continue to swim upward,
the next round comes.

01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:27.840
LAURA: That's the last rage.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.739
ASHLEY: That's the last
rage, so keep going till I...

01:04:31.864 --> 01:04:34.006
I want to get to the
eye of the storm.

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:37.006
MATT: You're close,
you're close.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:39.006
But you got another two rounds
or so before you reach the top.

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.489
ASHLEY: Fuck.
SAM: Oh no.

01:04:41.904 --> 01:04:44.656
MATT: You're about to fall out
of your rage, what do you do?

01:04:47.823 --> 01:04:50.531
ASHLEY: See if this
will work, hang on.

01:04:53.697 --> 01:04:56.715
Can I dash? Can I--
MATT: You've been dashing up.

01:04:56.739 --> 01:04:58.548
ASHLEY: I know, I know, okay.

01:04:58.572 --> 01:05:00.197
Um, um, um.

01:05:04.114 --> 01:05:05.799
So the storm's going.

01:05:05.823 --> 01:05:06.590
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:05:06.614 --> 01:05:08.173
ASHLEY: Is there
lightning still?

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:10.632
MATT: There's lightning in
the space around you, yes.

01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:12.507
And the storm is
approaching you,

01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:15.465
but you can feel the
energy starting to drift,

01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:18.799
your vision starting to go dark.

01:05:18.823 --> 01:05:20.880
The damage you've sustained
has been too strong

01:05:20.904 --> 01:05:22.673
and you're currently teetering

01:05:22.697 --> 01:05:24.531
on that line between
life and death.

01:05:28.572 --> 01:05:32.322
That light that shines inside
you is starting to fade.

01:05:33.614 --> 01:05:34.823
What do you do?

01:05:41.781 --> 01:05:42.904
ASHLEY: Fuck, okay.

01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:47.905
Can I...

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.256
(sighs) I don't have
to roll anything,

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.006
so that's not going
to help. (exhales)

01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.880
MATT: What do you still
have at your disposal?

01:05:58.904 --> 01:06:01.155
ASHLEY: Well, I have
Zealous Presence,

01:06:02.656 --> 01:06:03.757
but I'm not rolling anything

01:06:03.781 --> 01:06:05.905
so that's not really
going to help with that.

01:06:12.904 --> 01:06:14.548
I don't...

01:06:14.572 --> 01:06:16.423
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, oh fuck.

01:06:16.447 --> 01:06:18.298
Everybody's watching,
this is great.

01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:19.881
SAM: Yeah, yeah, we're
all watching you.

01:06:19.905 --> 01:06:24.905
MATT: (crackling)
(thunder rumbling)

01:06:25.904 --> 01:06:28.072
(whooshing)

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.131
ASHLEY: I can't do anything.

01:06:35.155 --> 01:06:36.423
SAM: What sustains rage?

01:06:36.447 --> 01:06:37.215
LAURA: Can you hit yourself?

01:06:37.239 --> 01:06:39.197
Can you damage yourself?

01:06:40.531 --> 01:06:41.298
MATT: Can't damage yourself,

01:06:41.322 --> 01:06:42.090
the only way to
get up is through--

01:06:42.114 --> 01:06:43.715
LAURA: You can't
Kylo Ren yourself

01:06:43.739 --> 01:06:45.673
and hit yourself to stay angry?

01:06:45.697 --> 01:06:47.880
MATT: (laughs) Not really.

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:50.881
ASHLEY: Is there a way
I can get into the path

01:06:50.905 --> 01:06:52.280
of lightning or something?

01:06:53.988 --> 01:06:54.880
LAURA: Yeah.

01:06:54.904 --> 01:06:56.864
MATT: Go ahead and make
a perception check.

01:06:57.988 --> 01:06:59.799
MARISHA: Come on.
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay.

01:06:59.823 --> 01:07:00.988
SAM: Lightning rod.

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:06.423
ASHLEY: 18.

01:07:06.447 --> 01:07:07.423
MATT: 18.

01:07:07.447 --> 01:07:08.799
Glancing off the
side of your eye,

01:07:08.823 --> 01:07:11.173
you can see some of the
arcs (lightning crashing)

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:14.799
flashing around and you just
sense the air to your left

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:18.799
starting to get that
tingling sensation,

01:07:18.823 --> 01:07:21.880
like something's about to
happen, that anticipation.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.697
ASHLEY: Okay, if I feel that,

01:07:25.155 --> 01:07:29.880
I want to attract it, so
I hold out the sword up.

01:07:29.904 --> 01:07:32.507
MATT: You hold the
sword out. (rumbling)

01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.048
A bolt of lightning arcs
straight to the tip of the blade

01:07:35.072 --> 01:07:36.799
down into your
arm and your torso

01:07:36.823 --> 01:07:39.215
and as it fills
you, you scream out

01:07:39.239 --> 01:07:41.632
in what you expect to be pain.

01:07:41.656 --> 01:07:44.715
It's power, but it doesn't hurt.

01:07:44.739 --> 01:07:46.340
In that moment, you
look back at the sword.

01:07:46.364 --> 01:07:48.590
(crackling) the
energy still crackling

01:07:48.614 --> 01:07:49.904
up and down the front of it,

01:07:50.988 --> 01:07:53.673
and you're sustained
for the moment,

01:07:53.697 --> 01:07:57.173
and you continue to
fly up. (whooshing)

01:07:57.197 --> 01:08:01.880
You hit the clouds
(cracking) and break through

01:08:01.904 --> 01:08:04.840
the heaviness of the
darkness pushing past you

01:08:04.864 --> 01:08:07.840
before suddenly, you
open into a pocket

01:08:07.864 --> 01:08:09.072
in the center of the storm.

01:08:10.864 --> 01:08:12.632
This vacuous expanse

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:16.880
where you're surrounded
by this empty void,

01:08:16.904 --> 01:08:19.048
where the lightning (crackling)

01:08:19.072 --> 01:08:21.155
arcs around it like
the inside of an orb.

01:08:22.656 --> 01:08:23.880
And there on the opposite side,

01:08:23.904 --> 01:08:27.381
you see the face staring at you,

01:08:27.405 --> 01:08:31.489
crackling eyes of
angered nature.

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:39.215
"Where do you find
your strength?"

01:08:39.239 --> 01:08:40.880
"Where do you find
your strength?"

01:08:40.904 --> 01:08:43.905
(rumbling)

01:08:59.531 --> 01:09:00.322
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:09:02.739 --> 01:09:03.904
(chuckles) I'm so nervous.

01:09:08.905 --> 01:09:10.905
(sighs)

01:09:12.072 --> 01:09:15.632
I...

01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:17.114
I protect.

01:09:20.405 --> 01:09:22.590
I find my strength
in my friends.

01:09:22.614 --> 01:09:24.904
I find my strength
in my family, and

01:09:28.322 --> 01:09:29.864
laying my life before them.

01:09:35.531 --> 01:09:38.322
MATT: (crashing)

01:09:40.823 --> 01:09:42.757
Bolts of energy
begin to just gather,

01:09:42.781 --> 01:09:44.381
more and more frequent

01:09:44.405 --> 01:09:45.173
arcing all around you.

01:09:45.197 --> 01:09:48.030
The inside of this dark space
begins to light up all over,

01:09:49.823 --> 01:09:51.507
hitting in the center, sparking.

01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:53.340
You're having to
push against it.

01:09:53.364 --> 01:09:54.880
It seems like a
whirlwind is spinning up.

01:09:54.904 --> 01:09:56.880
The wind is pushing at you
and you beat your wings

01:09:56.904 --> 01:09:57.880
as hard as you can,

01:09:57.904 --> 01:10:00.114
still teetering on that
edge of consciousness.

01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:04.840
(growling)

01:10:04.864 --> 01:10:05.656
"Then

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:09.904
"protect them."

01:10:13.739 --> 01:10:15.880
And it all goes dark,

01:10:15.904 --> 01:10:19.114
until all you see are those
two burning, crackling eyes.

01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:23.864
"Protect them."

01:10:25.904 --> 01:10:27.197
As everything goes to dark.

01:10:30.614 --> 01:10:32.215
(gasps) You take a deep breath,

01:10:32.239 --> 01:10:34.880
still sitting in the
middle of the dark mud,

01:10:34.904 --> 01:10:36.340
rain pattering down on you.

01:10:36.364 --> 01:10:37.548
You're freezing to your core.

01:10:37.572 --> 01:10:41.006
Your whole body is shaking
from the temperature.

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.881
You look around you and you're
in the center of the grove

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:46.656
at who knows what
ungodly hour, alone.

01:10:47.572 --> 01:10:50.739
You look down at the blade
you placed in the dirt.

01:10:52.155 --> 01:10:53.531
LAURA: (excited noise) Oh!

01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:03.572
ASHLEY: Um.

01:11:06.904 --> 01:11:08.030
I'll take the sword.

01:11:09.697 --> 01:11:12.131
MATT: As you reach
for it, (crackling)

01:11:12.155 --> 01:11:13.590
energy strikes between your hand

01:11:13.614 --> 01:11:16.239
and the blade for a
moment, and you pull back.

01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:21.904
And you grab it, and it
feels warm to your touch.

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:25.947
ASHLEY: I wipe it down.

01:11:35.904 --> 01:11:37.656
I'll sheathe it
and I'll go inside.

01:11:38.904 --> 01:11:39.697
MATT: Okay.

01:11:40.904 --> 01:11:45.904
You wander back in and it
seems that most of the group

01:11:46.614 --> 01:11:50.215
is in some state of
sprawled out and sleeping

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.964
in this slumber party

01:11:52.988 --> 01:11:56.173
of a main area in the temple,

01:11:56.197 --> 01:11:59.715
with varying degrees of
consciousness and
unconsciousness.

01:11:59.739 --> 01:12:04.739
You can see Caduceus and
his father, Cornelius,

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:06.340
nodding off,

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:10.880
two half-dranken cups of now
cooled tea in their hands.

01:12:10.904 --> 01:12:13.364
But it's quiet, it's peaceful.

01:12:14.572 --> 01:12:15.880
And you swear, listening out,

01:12:15.904 --> 01:12:19.880
the rain seems to
be subsiding gently,

01:12:19.904 --> 01:12:22.531
lessening, calming.

01:12:33.447 --> 01:12:36.364
ASHLEY: I'll go see
where Beau is sleeping

01:12:37.614 --> 01:12:41.632
and just lay beside her

01:12:41.656 --> 01:12:44.947
and stare at her
until I fall asleep.

01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:48.673
MARISHA: I just roll over,

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:49.823
being in that,

01:12:50.988 --> 01:12:53.988
when you know your significant
other isn't beside you,

01:12:56.155 --> 01:12:58.823
lighter sleep, just roll over.

01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:00.904
You okay?

01:13:03.239 --> 01:13:04.904
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm okay.

01:13:07.072 --> 01:13:07.904
MARISHA: Okay.

01:13:10.114 --> 01:13:12.880
Hold me.
(chuckling)

01:13:12.904 --> 01:13:13.799
ASHLEY: I bring her in and--

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:17.548
MARISHA: Oh, oh
god, you're so wet.

01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:19.507
ASHLEY: Oh shit, I'm sorry.

01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:22.090
I take off my cloak,
all the stuff,

01:13:22.114 --> 01:13:23.447
try to wring out my hair.

01:13:25.697 --> 01:13:27.799
(laughter)

01:13:27.823 --> 01:13:31.964
MARISHA: I just warm up
her arms a little bit.

01:13:31.988 --> 01:13:32.880
MATT: Okay.

01:13:32.904 --> 01:13:35.340
MARISHA: I'll clasp
and hold her hands

01:13:35.364 --> 01:13:36.904
as I drift back to sleep.

01:13:39.904 --> 01:13:41.614
ASHLEY: (exhales)
MATT: Okay.

01:13:43.904 --> 01:13:45.964
You may all take your long rest.

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.964
LAURA: I had to do something
before we went to sleep.

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:49.590
MATT: Okay, what
do you want to do?

01:13:49.614 --> 01:13:50.757
LAURA: I have to send a message.

01:13:50.781 --> 01:13:52.880
LIAM: To [inaudible].
LAURA: Uh-huh.

01:13:52.904 --> 01:13:55.298
I have to send a
message to Wensworth,

01:13:55.322 --> 01:13:56.964
Wens, Wayne's World---
MATT: Wensforth.

01:13:56.988 --> 01:13:58.880
LIAM: Wilbur.
MATT: Wayne's World, yeah.

01:13:58.904 --> 01:14:01.173
LAURA: Have to find out

01:14:01.197 --> 01:14:03.006
to find out what's happenin'.

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:04.090
MATT: Sure.

01:14:04.114 --> 01:14:05.880
LAURA: So I'm going to try
to send a message to him.

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:06.904
MATT: All right.

01:14:07.781 --> 01:14:08.881
LAURA: I'll have to
do this at 4th-level

01:14:08.905 --> 01:14:10.006
because I'm out of thirds.

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.632
MATT: Okay, it is...

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:12.757
Well yeah, go.

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:13.590
LAURA: Is that--

01:14:13.614 --> 01:14:14.632
MATT: Yeah, you
can totally do it.

01:14:14.656 --> 01:14:15.423
LAURA: It's late.

01:14:15.447 --> 01:14:17.799
MATT: Yeah, but when's
that ever stopped you?

01:14:17.823 --> 01:14:18.757
TRAVIS: That poor fucker.
MATT: Yeah.

01:14:18.781 --> 01:14:21.048
(laughter)

01:14:21.072 --> 01:14:23.572
LAURA: Hey, what's
happening, are you okay?

01:14:24.405 --> 01:14:26.173
Yussa sounds like screaming!

01:14:26.197 --> 01:14:28.673
I tried to contact him
and he was screaming!

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:29.632
Are you dead?

01:14:29.656 --> 01:14:34.030
Oh gods. Are you okay, please?

01:14:36.447 --> 01:14:37.904
MATT: There's a pause before,

01:14:40.322 --> 01:14:41.531
"Hello?

01:14:43.823 --> 01:14:46.880
"Master's still
doing his journey."

01:14:46.904 --> 01:14:47.923
LAURA: Oh shit.

01:14:47.947 --> 01:14:51.256
MATT: "Sorry about
that business.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.239
"I think old friends stopped by.

01:14:54.904 --> 01:14:55.904
"I may have been had,

01:14:58.572 --> 01:14:59.531
"but we're safe."

01:15:03.114 --> 01:15:04.072
LAURA: Okay.

01:15:07.864 --> 01:15:08.632
Okay.

01:15:08.656 --> 01:15:10.280
TRAVIS: (whispering)
May have been had?

01:15:16.072 --> 01:15:18.715
LAURA: Doesn't even know
that Yussa's fucking

01:15:18.739 --> 01:15:20.880
being tortured
right now, mentally.

01:15:20.904 --> 01:15:21.697
Fuck.

01:15:22.531 --> 01:15:23.697
How did he make it out?

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.340
I'mma send one more message.

01:15:27.364 --> 01:15:28.381
MATT: Sure.
SAM: (sneezes)

01:15:28.405 --> 01:15:29.173
MATT: Gesundheit.
MARISHA: Bless you.

01:15:29.197 --> 01:15:29.964
LIAM: <i>Gesund</i>.

01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:31.256
LAURA: Wait!
SAM: Hair in my nose.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.465
LAURA: How did you make it out?

01:15:33.489 --> 01:15:34.988
Did they hurt you?

01:15:37.656 --> 01:15:40.880
I'm talking about
the old wizard.

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.280
Did he hurt you?

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:48.880
You should really wake Yussa up.

01:15:48.904 --> 01:15:51.072
(laughter)

01:15:52.489 --> 01:15:54.239
MATT: "No, he didn't hurt me.

01:15:56.155 --> 01:16:00.280
"I think I might
have been ensorcelled

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.197
"to let them in.

01:16:04.904 --> 01:16:06.322
"but they didn't stay long.

01:16:09.447 --> 01:16:12.923
"I'm trying." (chuckles)

01:16:12.947 --> 01:16:15.381
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:16.799
Well, at least he's not dead.

01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:17.715
I don't know if I'm
talking to anyone

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:18.904
or just myself right now.

01:16:19.904 --> 01:16:21.173
Is everybody sleeping?

01:16:21.197 --> 01:16:22.840
TRAVIS: No, I'm with you.
SAM: This is earlier.

01:16:22.864 --> 01:16:23.673
LAURA: Oh, this is earlier?

01:16:23.697 --> 01:16:24.715
Okay, good.

01:16:24.739 --> 01:16:25.673
TRAVIS: I'm still here.

01:16:25.697 --> 01:16:27.590
LAURA: Okay, so that
happened. (laughs)

01:16:27.614 --> 01:16:29.256
SAM: Oh, crazy.
LAURA: I know.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.881
Okay, you go back
to sleep, sorry.

01:16:30.905 --> 01:16:32.465
ASHLEY: I think I'm going
to go for a walk outside.

01:16:32.489 --> 01:16:34.923
LAURA: Okay.
(laughter)

01:16:34.947 --> 01:16:37.880
SAM: Careful, it sounds like
there's a storm brewing.

01:16:37.904 --> 01:16:40.173
I heard some, like,
Italian thunder.

01:16:40.197 --> 01:16:40.964
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah?

01:16:40.988 --> 01:16:42.006
I don't know what that is.
LIAM: I'm going out, too.

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.880
You go this way,
I'll go that way.

01:16:42.904 --> 01:16:44.799
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, okay. Yeah.

01:16:44.823 --> 01:16:45.964
You okay over there, Beau?

01:16:45.988 --> 01:16:47.173
MARISHA: Yeah, you need me?

01:16:47.197 --> 01:16:47.964
ASHLEY: Nah, I'm good.

01:16:47.988 --> 01:16:49.381
MARISHA: I'm going
to go to sleep, then.

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:51.381
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: Hi, doggie.

01:16:51.405 --> 01:16:52.757
ASHLEY: Oh, hi, doggie.

01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:54.880
MATT: Pulling some Witcher
timeline shenanigans here now.

01:16:54.904 --> 01:16:56.465
TRAVIS: You're my
favorite customer.

01:16:56.489 --> 01:16:58.256
(laughter)

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.632
LAURA: And then I
had one more thing

01:16:59.656 --> 01:17:00.548
that I wanted to do.
MATT: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

01:17:00.572 --> 01:17:01.340
Go for it, sure.

01:17:01.364 --> 01:17:02.423
LAURA: But this could
be after everybody's--

01:17:02.447 --> 01:17:03.632
SAM: This is earlier still.

01:17:03.656 --> 01:17:04.423
LAURA: No, this is later.

01:17:04.447 --> 01:17:05.548
(laughter)

01:17:05.572 --> 01:17:06.381
MATT: We got to
untangle this as we go.

01:17:06.405 --> 01:17:07.881
LAURA: Just fast forward in
time-- LIAM: Go back to
Trostenwald.

01:17:07.905 --> 01:17:08.964
LAURA: -- because I
want this to be after

01:17:08.988 --> 01:17:10.507
Fjord and I went on our walk.

01:17:10.531 --> 01:17:11.340
MATT: Yeah, okay, sure.

01:17:11.364 --> 01:17:12.880
LAURA: Before I go to sleep.
MATT: Right.

01:17:12.904 --> 01:17:13.880
LAURA: But I can be by myself.

01:17:13.904 --> 01:17:15.465
MATT: Hey, Dani's the one
who's going to untangle this.

01:17:15.489 --> 01:17:16.340
I don't give a shit.

01:17:16.364 --> 01:17:17.632
(laughter)

01:17:17.656 --> 01:17:20.322
MATT: I ain't doin'
the recaps. (laughs)

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:26.880
LAURA: I want to
wander off by myself.

01:17:26.904 --> 01:17:28.006
MATT: Okay.

01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:29.340
LIAM: This corner's taken.

01:17:29.364 --> 01:17:31.256
(laughter)

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.799
MATT: "Taken.

01:17:32.823 --> 01:17:33.964
"Seat's taken."
LAURA: Find a little--

01:17:33.988 --> 01:17:36.239
alcove in the temple.

01:17:38.739 --> 01:17:41.256
And I'm going to just

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.614
say: Hey, Artie.

01:17:43.447 --> 01:17:45.697
I need to scry on
somebody, okay?

01:17:48.988 --> 01:17:50.131
Are you here?

01:17:50.155 --> 01:17:51.880
I want to scry on--

01:17:51.904 --> 01:17:53.905
(whispering) I want
to scry on Vandran.

01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:59.904
MATT: You hear a voice go,

01:18:01.322 --> 01:18:03.131
"Um, terribly sorry.

01:18:03.155 --> 01:18:05.381
"Remind me who this
Vandran person is?"

01:18:05.405 --> 01:18:06.904
LAURA: Vandran is the guy that--

01:18:08.197 --> 01:18:09.799
He was Fjord's mentor

01:18:09.823 --> 01:18:12.507
and Fjord-- I know he's
really important to him

01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:13.880
and he won't let
me check up on him,

01:18:13.904 --> 01:18:16.030
and I think I should
check up on him.

01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:19.799
MATT: "Then let's
give it a shot."

01:18:19.823 --> 01:18:21.090
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:21.114 --> 01:18:22.799
We checked up on him
before, so I know

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:23.840
what he looks like
and everything.

01:18:23.864 --> 01:18:24.673
I have the description

01:18:24.697 --> 01:18:25.632
and all that shit.
MATT: Correct, yeah.

01:18:25.656 --> 01:18:28.256
LAURA: Okay, I'm going
to cast 5th-level spell.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.489
MATT: You got it, so you're
going to scry on him.

01:18:33.197 --> 01:18:34.405
What's the DC?

01:18:35.405 --> 01:18:37.173
LAURA: Of scry?
MATT: Yeah.

01:18:37.197 --> 01:18:37.988
LAURA: Okay, hold on.

01:18:38.904 --> 01:18:41.173
Let me look.

01:18:41.197 --> 01:18:42.880
MATT: It's your
general spell DC, so.

01:18:42.904 --> 01:18:44.322
LAURA: Oh, then I think it's 18.

01:18:45.405 --> 01:18:46.340
MATT: And I believe
wisdom, right?

01:18:46.364 --> 01:18:47.155
Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:49.904 --> 01:18:50.880
MATT: As you concentrate
for a second,

01:18:50.904 --> 01:18:53.880
you feel Artie's hands
touch on your temples,

01:18:53.904 --> 01:18:55.048
almost like he's about
to close your eyes

01:18:55.072 --> 01:18:55.880
like a Guess Who game,

01:18:55.904 --> 01:18:57.673
but it's just on the
sides of the face.

01:18:57.697 --> 01:19:01.880
LAURA: Can you just give
a little, a massugle?

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:02.673
MATT: "Why not?"
LAURA: Been a hard--

01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:05.131
MATT: He goes and massages
the temples for a minute.

01:19:05.155 --> 01:19:05.923
And you're like,
"Oh, that's good."

01:19:05.947 --> 01:19:07.880
And he goes "Hey, look at that,"

01:19:07.904 --> 01:19:09.880
and then tilts your head up,

01:19:09.904 --> 01:19:11.880
and as you do, you feel
your vision (whooshing)

01:19:11.904 --> 01:19:15.131
jettisoned through the ceiling,
up into the storm clouds.

01:19:15.155 --> 01:19:16.256
And then as you're lost,

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.632
drifting on the
winds of the storm,

01:19:19.656 --> 01:19:20.840
it seems endless.

01:19:20.864 --> 01:19:23.590
(whooshing) Just
being buffeted around,

01:19:23.614 --> 01:19:25.923
not to a painful degree, but
just a little disorienting,

01:19:25.947 --> 01:19:28.590
until suddenly you
break the clouds below

01:19:28.614 --> 01:19:31.006
and you can see
occasional flashes

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:34.880
of distant lightning
reflecting on ocean water.

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:37.880
And then you blink
your eyes for a second

01:19:37.904 --> 01:19:40.904
and you're in a jungle.

01:19:42.114 --> 01:19:46.173
You can hear late
night jungle insects

01:19:46.197 --> 01:19:47.673
and crickets, and
other such creatures,

01:19:47.697 --> 01:19:50.880
just (chirping),

01:19:50.904 --> 01:19:52.905
all echoing through the space.

01:19:54.155 --> 01:19:57.131
And you see a little

01:19:57.155 --> 01:20:00.864
makeshift cabin

01:20:02.781 --> 01:20:03.656
made of driftwood,

01:20:04.864 --> 01:20:06.988
and a very faint glow
in the inside of it.

01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:15.531
And you blink again, and
you see on the inside,

01:20:15.904 --> 01:20:19.880
sitting by a very small,
almost just embers fire,

01:20:19.904 --> 01:20:22.781
an older gentleman who
matches the description,

01:20:23.572 --> 01:20:25.904
facial hair a bit
scragglier, a bit longer,

01:20:26.904 --> 01:20:29.739
just sitting and reading a book.

01:20:31.904 --> 01:20:34.880
Picks up a pipe, puffs on it.

01:20:34.904 --> 01:20:37.880
Sets it down and
just keeps reading.

01:20:37.904 --> 01:20:40.423
By himself, peaceful.

01:20:40.447 --> 01:20:41.757
LAURA: There's nobody else?

01:20:41.781 --> 01:20:43.090
Nobody in the cabin?

01:20:43.114 --> 01:20:43.881
MATT: Just him.

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:45.322
LAURA: Does his face look--

01:20:46.364 --> 01:20:48.507
(sighs) I don't know,

01:20:48.531 --> 01:20:51.173
troubled, or serene, or?

01:20:51.197 --> 01:20:52.447
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:20:56.197 --> 01:20:58.173
LIAM: Get a good one.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:20:58.197 --> 01:20:59.964
I'm going to use
this old wood one.

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:01.215
Oh, that didn't count

01:21:01.239 --> 01:21:03.280
because it flipped
out of my hand.

01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:08.548
15.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:09.364
MATT: 15?

01:21:11.155 --> 01:21:13.173
You don't sense any
trouble in the face.

01:21:13.197 --> 01:21:16.465
I mean, his face is
heavily marked with lines

01:21:16.489 --> 01:21:20.340
and wrinkles from just years
of living in the elements,

01:21:20.364 --> 01:21:25.048
but where the creases are,
in the eyes and the mouth,

01:21:25.072 --> 01:21:29.030
they seem to not
denote any sort of

01:21:30.904 --> 01:21:35.114
stress at the moment,
here in this quiet night.

01:21:35.947 --> 01:21:37.507
LAURA: Can I see
what he's reading?

01:21:37.531 --> 01:21:38.823
MATT: You cannot.

01:21:41.072 --> 01:21:44.880
Roll a perception check,
just for the hell of it.

01:21:44.904 --> 01:21:46.904
See if you surprise me.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:51.531
LAURA: 23.

01:21:53.614 --> 01:21:55.715
MATT: (sighs) The book
cover you can't see

01:21:55.739 --> 01:21:57.131
because he's holding
it in his lap

01:21:57.155 --> 01:21:59.923
as he's setting his pipe
down, as you glance down.

01:21:59.947 --> 01:22:02.614
He's probably two-thirds
of the way through.

01:22:04.489 --> 01:22:05.880
But you get through a
few of the sentences.

01:22:05.904 --> 01:22:08.799
There's something about this
that seems really familiar.

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:12.298
Deals with returning
to the Menagerie Coast

01:22:12.322 --> 01:22:13.656
after she was taken.

01:22:15.489 --> 01:22:16.964
Shit, he's two-thirds of
the way through "Tusk Love."

01:22:16.988 --> 01:22:18.880
LAURA: (laughs) Yes.

01:22:18.904 --> 01:22:19.880

ASHLEY: Yes.

it as a joke. (laughs)

01:22:28.904 --> 01:22:30.904

reading "Tusk Love."

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:33.715
LIAM: It's a good book.
MATT: Yeah.

01:22:33.739 --> 01:22:35.673
LAURA: Vandran is the coolest!

MARISHA: Apparently,
the only smut novel

01:22:39.614 --> 01:22:40.880
and they all love it.
LAURA: The most popular one.

01:22:40.904 --> 01:22:41.923
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: It's 50 Shades of Gray.

01:22:41.947 --> 01:22:43.757
MATT: No, there's a
lot of smut novels.

01:22:43.781 --> 01:22:44.880
It's just really popular.

01:22:44.904 --> 01:22:45.673
MARISHA: 50 Shades of Gray.

01:22:45.697 --> 01:22:47.465
MATT: Yeah, it gets around
a lot. MARISHA: I get it.

01:22:47.489 --> 01:22:48.880
50 Shades of Green.

LAURA: There's nothing, like--

01:22:58.447 --> 01:23:01.381
I can't get a clue
of where he is?

01:23:01.405 --> 01:23:03.880
MATT: Unfortunately, Scry
doesn't really help out with
that.

01:23:03.904 --> 01:23:04.864
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:09.090
SAM: Is there a map behind him,

01:23:09.114 --> 01:23:10.880
with a big arrow that says--

01:23:10.904 --> 01:23:12.465
TRAVIS and SAM: "You are here"?

01:23:12.489 --> 01:23:14.298

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.656
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:23:24.739 --> 01:23:27.880
All right, I guess that's all.

01:23:27.904 --> 01:23:28.880
MATT: Okay.

01:23:28.904 --> 01:23:30.590
LAURA: (whooshing)
MATT: (whooshing) You pull back

01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:33.880
and Artie's hands move from
the temple, and he's like,

01:23:33.904 --> 01:23:38.880
"All right, back to my
evening, and enjoy yours."

01:23:38.904 --> 01:23:40.256
(whooshing)

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.090
LAURA: Thanks for the massage!

01:23:42.114 --> 01:23:44.447
MATT: "No problem!"

01:23:50.781 --> 01:23:52.656
MARISHA: So where in
the timeline are we now?

01:23:53.447 --> 01:23:54.880
MATT: We're back to-- LAURA:
We're back to where we were.

01:23:54.904 --> 01:23:56.673

MARISHA: Oh, okay.

01:23:56.697 --> 01:23:57.923

back to the beginning.

01:23:57.947 --> 01:23:59.840
TRAVIS: (whooshing)

01:23:59.864 --> 01:24:02.048
LIAM: Wait, roll forward to
the sunset of the campaign.

01:24:02.072 --> 01:24:04.215
MATT: Right, okay. (laughs)

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.880
MARISHA: Let's all start
saying our goodbyes.

01:24:05.904 --> 01:24:08.572
And then jump back to here.

01:24:10.447 --> 01:24:11.239
LAURA: Okay.

taking all the time.

thing if you have--

TRAVIS: Yeah, I can see it.

01:24:27.155 --> 01:24:28.131
MATT: Yeah, do it!

01:24:28.155 --> 01:24:29.548
LIAM: The wheels
are turning, do it.

01:24:29.572 --> 01:24:31.881
LAURA: Can I use one
more Message spell?

01:24:31.905 --> 01:24:33.864
MATT: If you've got
the spell slots for it.

01:24:35.489 --> 01:24:36.590

01:29:40.322 --> 01:29:42.298
that is not fed
by the hot water,

01:29:42.322 --> 01:29:44.548
because it's kind of
random where you get.

01:29:44.572 --> 01:29:46.298
So it's fucking cold.

01:29:46.322 --> 01:29:48.423
TRAVIS: Fuck this!
(laughter)

01:29:48.447 --> 01:29:51.590
TRAVIS: (shouting)
Your neck seizes up.

01:29:51.614 --> 01:29:53.923
TALIESIN: Just keep
scoochin', keep scoochin'.

01:29:53.947 --> 01:29:56.548
MARISHA: I've got a warm patch
right here. TALIESIN: Got to
find a jet.

01:29:56.572 --> 01:29:57.548
MARISHA: Right here, feels good.

01:29:57.572 --> 01:29:58.548
There you go.

01:29:58.572 --> 01:29:59.880
ASHLEY and SAM: We're
in a hot spring.

01:29:59.904 --> 01:30:01.881
LIAM: Wow. I was like,
"What's goin' on?"

01:30:01.905 --> 01:30:03.799
Are we poisoning
Fjord in his sleep?

01:30:03.823 --> 01:30:06.298
(laughter)

01:30:06.322 --> 01:30:07.507
MATT: Are you joining them
in the hot spring, Caleb?

01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:09.423
LIAM: Of course I am
joining in the hot spring.

01:30:09.447 --> 01:30:12.048
This has been been
the hardest day ever.

01:30:12.072 --> 01:30:12.904
MATT: Roll a d6.

01:30:15.239 --> 01:30:16.048
LIAM: Three.

01:30:16.072 --> 01:30:18.256
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's
freezing. Freezing as fuck.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.298
LIAM: The one that I picked?
LAURA: Find a hot spot, find a
hot spot!

01:30:21.322 --> 01:30:22.256
MARISHA: Over here,
get over here!

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.256
ASHLEY: Yeah, we have a
hot spot that's really--

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.465
LIAM: I deserve this frigidity.

01:30:26.489 --> 01:30:29.381
(laughter)

01:30:29.405 --> 01:30:30.880
TALIESIN: Cold and
then you go to the hot,

01:30:30.904 --> 01:30:32.632
and you go back to the cold,
it really loosens you up.

01:30:32.656 --> 01:30:34.507
LIAM: Oh, I'm doing
the dog paddle.

01:30:34.531 --> 01:30:37.131
MATT: It's like soaking
self-flagellation.

01:30:37.155 --> 01:30:40.131
You all eventually find some
sort of a middle ground.

01:30:40.155 --> 01:30:41.880
It's a little crowded to get
to the warmer spots there,

01:30:41.904 --> 01:30:43.880
but you all are enjoying

01:30:43.904 --> 01:30:46.531
that cleansing warm
hot spring experience.

01:30:48.072 --> 01:30:49.880
All right?
TALIESIN: Everyone sleep well?

01:30:49.904 --> 01:30:51.614
Everyone feeling rested?

01:30:53.405 --> 01:30:58.465
ASHLEY: Yeah. Wait,
should we give a look-see?

01:30:58.489 --> 01:31:00.507
SAM: To what? Oh,
the eyes? The eyes?

01:31:00.531 --> 01:31:02.840
ASHLEY: Did you have
any dreams or anything?

01:31:02.864 --> 01:31:03.880
SAM: If you're naked
in the hot spring,

01:31:03.904 --> 01:31:05.964
why don't you just show us your
bodies? LAURA: This is the best
time to look.

01:31:05.988 --> 01:31:07.090
LIAM: Well, I didn't
have any dreams.

01:31:07.114 --> 01:31:08.923
I just stand up
out of the water.

01:31:08.947 --> 01:31:09.880
MARISHA: T-pose.

01:31:09.904 --> 01:31:11.880
SAM: I mean, any new eyes?

01:31:11.904 --> 01:31:12.880
LIAM: Full 360?

01:31:12.904 --> 01:31:13.880
MARISHA: Full, yep.

01:31:13.904 --> 01:31:14.880
LIAM: Yeah, you see everything.

01:31:14.904 --> 01:31:17.507
MATT: Between the
passive perception of

01:31:17.531 --> 01:31:18.632
Caduceus and a number
of other of you,

01:31:18.656 --> 01:31:20.507
you do not see any
additional eyes

01:31:20.531 --> 01:31:22.048
that have gathered
on your teammates.

01:31:22.072 --> 01:31:24.880
LIAM: Hold on, there's one
place we haven't looked.

01:31:24.904 --> 01:31:25.880
ASHLEY: Where's that?

01:31:25.904 --> 01:31:27.381
LIAM: Right here.

01:31:27.405 --> 01:31:28.298
ASHLEY: Ah!

01:31:28.322 --> 01:31:29.173
TRAVIS: The bottom of effort.

01:31:29.197 --> 01:31:30.757
LIAM: Ace Ventura.

01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:33.173
(laughter)

01:31:33.197 --> 01:31:34.947
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: You seem chipper.

01:31:36.322 --> 01:31:37.507
ASHLEY: Hmm? Me?

01:31:37.531 --> 01:31:40.632
TALIESIN: I don't know,
you seem a little--

01:31:40.656 --> 01:31:41.880
ASHLEY: I like it here.

01:31:41.904 --> 01:31:43.465
TALIESIN: Yeah, me, too.

01:31:43.489 --> 01:31:45.256
ASHLEY: I like it here a lot.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.880
TALIESIN: That's what I get from
my nat 20 perception, fuck it.

01:31:50.904 --> 01:31:53.715
(laughter)

01:31:53.739 --> 01:31:54.880
LAURA: Fjord?
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:31:54.904 --> 01:31:57.423
LAURA: I have to
tell you something.

01:31:57.447 --> 01:31:59.880
TRAVIS: Did you pee
in the hot spring?

01:31:59.904 --> 01:32:01.298
LAURA: Doesn't everybody?

01:32:01.322 --> 01:32:02.090
TRAVIS: No.

01:32:02.114 --> 01:32:04.905
LAURA: Oh. Anyway.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.880
MARISHA: What did you do?

01:32:17.904 --> 01:32:18.880
TRAVIS: Is this is a game?

01:32:18.904 --> 01:32:21.880
Am I supposed to guess
at your gestures?

01:32:21.904 --> 01:32:24.381
LAURA: I'm just going
to whisper in his ear

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.405
that I scryed on Vandran.

01:32:27.823 --> 01:32:32.364
TRAVIS: (stammers)

01:32:33.904 --> 01:32:35.090
TALIESIN: She
sighed the bad man.

01:32:35.114 --> 01:32:37.904
I don't know, that's what
I could get from them.

01:32:38.904 --> 01:32:39.840
TRAVIS: What did you say?

01:32:39.864 --> 01:32:41.006
LAURA: He's living in a jungle

01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:43.904
in a little, in a
little driftwood house.

01:32:44.864 --> 01:32:47.904
And he was smoking a pipe
and he was reading Tusk Love.

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:54.173
And I sent him a message.

01:32:54.197 --> 01:32:55.964
TRAVIS: Are you
telling me a dream

01:32:55.988 --> 01:32:57.298
or something that is true?
LAURA: No.

01:32:57.322 --> 01:32:59.048
And I sent him a
message, and I--

01:32:59.072 --> 01:33:01.964
I-- he sounded like--
he sounded so happy

01:33:01.988 --> 01:33:04.632
and taken aback to
know that I knew you.

01:33:04.656 --> 01:33:07.131
And he said that he wanted you

01:33:07.155 --> 01:33:08.864
to take care of yourself.

01:33:09.823 --> 01:33:12.781
And he also said that
he loved Tusk Love, too.

01:33:14.572 --> 01:33:16.880
TRAVIS: I have so many
different emotions about this.

01:33:16.904 --> 01:33:17.757
LAURA: I know.

01:33:17.781 --> 01:33:19.715
TRAVIS: You really--

01:33:19.739 --> 01:33:21.256
LAURA: I really did that.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.881
TRAVIS: And he was
reading Tusk Love?

01:33:22.905 --> 01:33:24.590
LAURA: Yeah!

01:33:24.614 --> 01:33:26.673
TRAVIS: In a small
hut, in a jungle?

01:33:26.697 --> 01:33:28.880
LAURA: Yeah. It
doesn't seem real.

01:33:28.904 --> 01:33:30.173
It doesn't seem like possible.

01:33:30.197 --> 01:33:31.840
TRAVIS: Of all the books?

01:33:31.864 --> 01:33:34.340
LAURA: I know, it's
a real good book.

01:33:34.364 --> 01:33:35.155
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:33:36.405 --> 01:33:37.280
He seemed happy?

01:33:38.405 --> 01:33:41.904
LAURA: He seemed, like,
content, if not lonely.

01:33:42.904 --> 01:33:44.590
TRAVIS: You didn't see
where, what jungle?

01:33:44.614 --> 01:33:45.757
LAURA: No, it was just a jungle.

01:33:45.781 --> 01:33:47.048
But it was like-- do I remember?

01:33:47.072 --> 01:33:48.881
It was like, we went
over the water, right?

01:33:48.905 --> 01:33:50.880
MATT: You remember a brief
moment of water and that was it.

01:33:50.904 --> 01:33:53.880
LAURA: I remember a
brief moment of water.

01:33:53.904 --> 01:33:54.923
LIAM: I'm sorry, but
what you're saying,

01:33:54.947 --> 01:33:57.904
we are talking about
your old friend?

01:33:58.988 --> 01:34:01.447
TRAVIS: Yes, yeah.
My old captain.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.489
LIAM: Reading Tusk Love?

01:34:04.489 --> 01:34:07.131
TRAVIS: In a hut in the
middle of the jungle.

01:34:07.155 --> 01:34:08.381
LIAM: Well, if anyone
here did not believe

01:34:08.405 --> 01:34:11.880
in fate before today,
brush those qualms aside.

01:34:11.904 --> 01:34:14.340
LAURA: But it's got to be
a jungle close to the water

01:34:14.364 --> 01:34:15.904
because it was a driftwood hut.

01:34:17.904 --> 01:34:18.823
TRAVIS: Right.

01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:21.880
I told you I didn't want to,

01:34:21.904 --> 01:34:24.155
I didn't want to
scry on Vandran.

01:34:25.947 --> 01:34:26.904
LAURA: I know.

01:34:34.656 --> 01:34:35.715
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:34:35.739 --> 01:34:36.880
LAURA: Are you mad at me?

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.572
TRAVIS: No, no. I'm not mad.

01:34:39.697 --> 01:34:41.048
LAURA: It's just, we're
going into this big,

01:34:41.072 --> 01:34:44.923
important thing and who
knows what's going to happen,

01:34:44.947 --> 01:34:47.364
and--
TRAVIS: I do. It will be fine.

01:34:48.322 --> 01:34:49.799
I suppose there
was some bit of me

01:34:49.823 --> 01:34:52.298
that wanted the
extra motivation,

01:34:52.322 --> 01:34:54.904
but coming out of this,

01:34:57.114 --> 01:35:00.988
and besides I-- now I really,
really want to find him.

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:04.880
TRAVIS: If only to take
that fucking book away!

01:35:04.904 --> 01:35:06.880
LAURA: (gasps) What!? No.
TRAVIS: Ha ha!

01:35:06.904 --> 01:35:08.215
LAURA: I want to meet
them now when we can have

01:35:08.239 --> 01:35:09.531
a good long talk.

01:35:10.614 --> 01:35:11.880
Just about that.

01:35:11.904 --> 01:35:13.197
TRAVIS: Okay. Sure.

01:35:15.197 --> 01:35:17.923
After I can, you know,

01:35:17.947 --> 01:35:19.673
share a few words first.

01:35:19.697 --> 01:35:20.489
LAURA: Of course.

01:35:22.155 --> 01:35:22.947
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:35:24.823 --> 01:35:25.923
LAURA: If you're mad
at me, I understand.

01:35:25.947 --> 01:35:27.215
TRAVIS: No, no.

01:35:27.239 --> 01:35:29.799
LAURA: That was an overstep.
TRAVIS: It's really hard to be
mad at you.

01:35:29.823 --> 01:35:31.173
That is a universal--

01:35:31.197 --> 01:35:33.256
LAURA: Especially look.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.072
I'm naked.

01:35:35.072 --> 01:35:37.298
(laughter)

01:35:37.322 --> 01:35:38.280
TRAVIS: You are.

01:35:39.697 --> 01:35:43.423
And so are they! It's a
close knit group, this.

01:35:43.447 --> 01:35:45.757
MARISHA: Very, very close knit.

01:35:45.781 --> 01:35:46.572
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:35:49.614 --> 01:35:50.904
It's fine.
LAURA: Okay.

01:35:54.155 --> 01:35:56.030
TRAVIS: How's everyone
feeling this morning?

01:35:57.904 --> 01:35:58.880
TALIESIN: Pretty good.

01:35:58.904 --> 01:35:59.880
ASHLEY: Pretty good, yeah.

01:35:59.904 --> 01:36:01.048
MARISHA: Not too bad, actually.

01:36:01.072 --> 01:36:02.880
ASHLEY: Yeah. TRAVIS: How many
of you actually believe that?

01:36:02.904 --> 01:36:04.799
I actually feel pretty good.

01:36:04.823 --> 01:36:05.757
You?
TALIESIN: Oh, aye.

01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:07.381
TRAVIS: Yeah? Do you feel good?

01:36:07.405 --> 01:36:08.590
ASHLEY: I feel-- I feel great.

01:36:08.614 --> 01:36:09.632
TRAVIS: Did you mean it?

01:36:09.656 --> 01:36:10.947
MARISHA: I did. Yeah.

01:36:12.364 --> 01:36:13.531
TRAVIS: What about you three?

01:36:14.531 --> 01:36:16.215
LAURA: Just left my mom.

01:36:16.239 --> 01:36:20.423
SAM: Yeah. My son died a
day ago, so no, not really.

01:36:20.447 --> 01:36:22.923
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:36:22.947 --> 01:36:25.697
LIAM: You know, if you want,

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:29.572
it's been a night of sleep
for you to think about it.

01:36:31.072 --> 01:36:32.904
I want you by our side, but

01:36:34.364 --> 01:36:35.840
it's got to be a hard
decision to make.

01:36:35.864 --> 01:36:38.947
And if you want to go back,
I can send you, if you want.

01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:42.381
SAM: But what are we doing?

01:36:42.405 --> 01:36:45.131
I mean, what is the plan?

01:36:45.155 --> 01:36:46.840
LAURA: We go to
Eiselcross from here.

01:36:46.864 --> 01:36:47.947
SAM: And do what?

01:36:48.904 --> 01:36:51.632
TRAVIS: I imagine we
lay in wait for Lucien,

01:36:51.656 --> 01:36:54.215
hope he hasn't beaten us there.

01:36:54.239 --> 01:36:55.880
Sync up with Essek,

01:36:55.904 --> 01:36:59.880
figure out who's going to join
us on this defensive build.

01:36:59.904 --> 01:37:02.632
TALIESIN: Maybe figure
out more about what it is.

01:37:02.656 --> 01:37:04.423
MARISHA: We know where
that secret passage is.

01:37:04.447 --> 01:37:07.632
If we still wanted to try
and go there and lay a trap.

01:37:07.656 --> 01:37:11.880
I don't think we can kill
Lucien so easily, but maybe

01:37:11.904 --> 01:37:14.465
if we can pick off some
of the other Tomb Takers.

01:37:14.489 --> 01:37:17.632
LAURA: I could lay-- you
could do it, too, I think.

01:37:17.656 --> 01:37:22.298
We could lay, like, symbols
on the ground as traps.

01:37:22.322 --> 01:37:25.090
And if they wander into it,
it could maybe, you know,

01:37:25.114 --> 01:37:26.881
lay like an ambush, because
they won't know we're there

01:37:26.905 --> 01:37:28.465
if they can't scry
on us anymore.

01:37:28.489 --> 01:37:29.880
TALIESIN: I have some thoughts.

01:37:29.904 --> 01:37:31.840
LIAM: There is
possibly another--

01:37:31.864 --> 01:37:34.006
(laughter)

01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:36.614
Possibly another problem
to worry about, as well.

01:37:39.614 --> 01:37:42.239
I think that Ikithon is

01:37:44.739 --> 01:37:46.739
aware that we've had
contact with Essek.

01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:49.155
MARISHA: What do you mean?

01:37:51.531 --> 01:37:53.548
LIAM: When we saw
him, he intimated--

01:37:53.572 --> 01:37:55.799
When he spoke to me?
When he spoke to me.

01:37:55.823 --> 01:37:57.048
MATT: When he
spoke to you, yeah.

01:37:57.072 --> 01:37:58.489
LIAM: He intimated

01:38:00.904 --> 01:38:02.739
he was aware of our connection.

01:38:04.864 --> 01:38:08.114
And unless Essek is taking
some sort of precautions,

01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:11.030
he is not hidden the way we are.

01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:15.280
And we might still
not be finished with

01:38:17.197 --> 01:38:18.880
my old family.

01:38:18.904 --> 01:38:19.799
SAM: What does that mean?

01:38:19.823 --> 01:38:20.880
Like he's going to Eiselcross?

01:38:20.904 --> 01:38:22.880
LAURA: Do we need to send a
message to Essek and let him
know?

01:38:22.904 --> 01:38:25.006
LIAM: Yes, we do need to send
a message to Essek. Yeah.

01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:26.006
MARISHA: I mean, to be fair,

01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:29.880
Essek has done a lot to
try and seclude himself

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:31.880
from all of this, based
on what he's done.

01:38:31.904 --> 01:38:34.131
He has taken some
measures of defense

01:38:34.155 --> 01:38:36.880
by hiding in Eiselcross.

01:38:36.904 --> 01:38:40.465
LIAM: Correct. And if he is
still, still with his people,

01:38:40.489 --> 01:38:41.904
then he's not alone.

01:38:42.904 --> 01:38:44.840
But we don't know where he is.

01:38:44.864 --> 01:38:47.239
TRAVIS: We are most definitely
not done with your family.

01:38:48.114 --> 01:38:51.006
LIAM: And they were able to
walk into your mother's house,

01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:52.256
looking like somebody else.

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.673
They could be there now, waiting
for us to walk in the door.

01:38:55.697 --> 01:38:59.715
So when we approach him, it
needs to be carefully and,

01:38:59.739 --> 01:39:02.131
yes, we should talk to
him before we arrive.

01:39:02.155 --> 01:39:04.381
LAURA: Should I send
him a message now?

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:05.964
TRAVIS: Well, hold on.

01:39:05.988 --> 01:39:07.673
I want to get back
to Veth's question

01:39:07.697 --> 01:39:09.881
because there's
strategy for days.

01:39:09.905 --> 01:39:14.799
Many evolutions of
this, but we are leaving

01:39:14.823 --> 01:39:16.697
and going back to Eiselcross and

01:39:17.904 --> 01:39:19.632
it's going to be dangerous

01:39:19.656 --> 01:39:20.964
and there will be inherent risk.

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:22.548
You know, all of
this, of course,

01:39:22.572 --> 01:39:23.364
but--

01:39:24.405 --> 01:39:27.904
SAM: Yeah, of course, but
I know what we're doing.

01:39:30.155 --> 01:39:33.381
And I want to be there
with you all to do it.

01:39:33.405 --> 01:39:36.781
But if we're just
wandering around,

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.923
you know, forgive me, but
I don't want to do that.

01:39:40.947 --> 01:39:44.465
LIAM: Well, we are not wandering
around. MARISHA: Yeah, I don't
think that's at all the plan.

01:39:44.489 --> 01:39:48.632
LIAM: Hopefully bringing our
complicated ally on board

01:39:48.656 --> 01:39:51.964
and we are going to lie
in wait for our enemy,

01:39:51.988 --> 01:39:54.904
slash friend and deal with him.

01:39:55.905 --> 01:39:57.923
LAURA: We know that their plan

01:39:57.947 --> 01:40:01.781
is to bring that
section of Aeor back.

01:40:02.904 --> 01:40:06.840
So if we can stop them from
doing that at the source,

01:40:06.864 --> 01:40:07.715
amazing.

01:40:07.739 --> 01:40:11.531
If we can't, we
have to follow them.

01:40:12.656 --> 01:40:15.880
We have to go to the city
to try to stop them there.

01:40:15.904 --> 01:40:17.215
LIAM: Or the city
is coming to us

01:40:17.239 --> 01:40:18.840
and we have a whole
new set of problems,

01:40:18.864 --> 01:40:21.256
but either way, it
needs to be dealt with.

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.880
And no one else is dealing
with it except for us.

01:40:24.904 --> 01:40:26.964
TRAVIS: I'm just
going to say it.

01:40:26.988 --> 01:40:29.590
Are we at all
entertaining working

01:40:29.614 --> 01:40:33.531
with Master Ikithon and
the Cerberus Assembly?

01:40:34.904 --> 01:40:35.781
TALIESIN: I am.

01:40:36.823 --> 01:40:37.905
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know.

01:40:39.904 --> 01:40:41.864
LAURA: I mean, they
would be as strong.

01:40:43.447 --> 01:40:45.880
TRAVIS: We have those
devices, that'll help,

01:40:45.904 --> 01:40:48.880
but it's going to be the
fucking fight of our lives.

01:40:48.904 --> 01:40:49.904
Even with Essek.

01:40:52.904 --> 01:40:54.507
We could,

01:40:54.531 --> 01:40:57.155
<i>could</i> reach out.

01:41:00.447 --> 01:41:04.531
MARISHA: Where did you leave it
off with him, with your old
master?

01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:09.447
LIAM: He's trying
to reestablish.

01:41:13.904 --> 01:41:17.048
I hate the very idea of
spending any time with him.

01:41:17.072 --> 01:41:18.298
MARISHA: Maybe we'll get lucky.

01:41:18.322 --> 01:41:20.322
He'll be killed in the fight.

01:41:22.864 --> 01:41:25.298
TRAVIS: Astrid,
Eadwulf might join.

01:41:25.322 --> 01:41:30.048
We have suspicions about where
their true loyalties lie.

01:41:30.072 --> 01:41:33.840
LIAM: Yeah, he's the one I'm
having a hard time predicting

01:41:33.864 --> 01:41:36.823
because he does not
typically put his neck out.

01:41:38.781 --> 01:41:41.880
MARISHA: Yeah, he doesn't really
seem like a frontline fighter.

01:41:41.904 --> 01:41:43.155
TALIESIN: This is a big deal.

01:41:45.864 --> 01:41:50.864
LIAM: Astrid and Eadwulf,
as difficult as that seems,

01:41:50.905 --> 01:41:53.880
would, I mean, who
are we kidding?

01:41:53.904 --> 01:41:55.006
We are grossly outmatched.

01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:57.880
We were lucky to escape with
our lives the last time.

01:41:57.904 --> 01:42:00.548
We are already dealing with
someone entirely compromised

01:42:00.572 --> 01:42:02.880
between both nations already.

01:42:02.904 --> 01:42:03.880
It's not like we have any kind

01:42:03.904 --> 01:42:07.880
of moral superiority
or place of judgment.

01:42:07.904 --> 01:42:10.298
TALIESIN: Well, I think,
honestly, you got a bit.

01:42:10.322 --> 01:42:11.881
I think you're willing to lean

01:42:11.905 --> 01:42:14.173
into a little bit of
moral superiority.

01:42:14.197 --> 01:42:15.405
Give yourself that.

01:42:17.904 --> 01:42:18.823
But--

01:42:20.572 --> 01:42:21.904
TRAVIS: What about a question?

01:42:24.656 --> 01:42:26.697
See what he says from afar.

01:42:27.904 --> 01:42:32.904
TALIESIN: Maybe from much
further once we're somewhere
cold.

01:42:42.904 --> 01:42:44.757
LIAM: Yeah, it has merits.

01:42:44.781 --> 01:42:46.614
It has drawbacks.

01:42:50.614 --> 01:42:52.904
I mean, I tried to
talk to his pupils.

01:42:55.697 --> 01:42:57.572
Everything is
potentially on the line.

01:43:00.697 --> 01:43:02.340
Any normal person
or rational person,

01:43:02.364 --> 01:43:04.673
why wouldn't they want to help,

01:43:04.697 --> 01:43:06.881
if they had the courage
and the ability?

01:43:06.905 --> 01:43:09.298
LAURA: Maybe we don't
appeal to his moral code.

01:43:09.322 --> 01:43:11.880
Maybe we appeal to
his desire for power.

01:43:11.904 --> 01:43:12.947
LIAM: And control.

01:43:14.904 --> 01:43:19.840
If the city comes,
yeah, control has gone.

01:43:19.864 --> 01:43:21.489
Possibly survival is gone.

01:43:22.656 --> 01:43:27.423
We don't know what these
thousands of voices want.

01:43:27.447 --> 01:43:28.880
Really.

01:43:28.904 --> 01:43:29.880
TRAVIS: He must know
something already.

01:43:29.904 --> 01:43:33.531
He followed us for
quite a while, yes?

01:43:34.572 --> 01:43:36.131
SAM: He also was
reaching out to you.

01:43:36.155 --> 01:43:37.256
LIAM: Yes.

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:40.757
SAM: Much more than ever before.

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:44.048
LIAM: (stammering) I've
been thinking the same thing

01:43:44.072 --> 01:43:47.215
and just not wanting
to admit it to myself.

01:43:47.239 --> 01:43:50.131
MARISHA: Do you think you could
work alongside your abuser?

01:43:50.155 --> 01:43:53.239
TRAVIS: (chuckles
quietly) Fucking shit.

01:43:54.904 --> 01:43:55.781
LIAM: For this?

01:43:57.364 --> 01:44:00.280
MARISHA: I wouldn't wish it
on anybody, for the record.

01:44:03.322 --> 01:44:04.114
But--

01:44:05.988 --> 01:44:08.364
LIAM: For a short period
of time, I can manage it.

01:44:09.864 --> 01:44:11.489
MARISHA: Do you think--

01:44:14.904 --> 01:44:17.239
not trying to be
patronizing or question you,

01:44:19.489 --> 01:44:20.904
but you've had elements with

01:44:23.072 --> 01:44:25.715
falling into dark places
in moments of stress,

01:44:25.739 --> 01:44:27.405
especially in the
middle of battle.

01:44:29.823 --> 01:44:33.881
And can't have you
mentally compromised,

01:44:33.905 --> 01:44:36.340
really need you on
your A-game out there.

01:44:36.364 --> 01:44:37.364
And if you think

01:44:38.489 --> 01:44:43.030
that he could potentially drum
up old trauma and old stress,

01:44:46.155 --> 01:44:48.405
I don't want to weaken
you by bringing him.

01:44:50.614 --> 01:44:53.239
LIAM: Ikithon is not a
temptation I need to worry
about.

01:44:59.823 --> 01:45:01.507
TALIESIN: Can I insight?

01:45:01.531 --> 01:45:02.322
MATT: Sure.

01:45:03.823 --> 01:45:04.614
TALIESIN: 17.

01:45:08.114 --> 01:45:09.632
LIAM: Straight on.

01:45:09.656 --> 01:45:11.322
MARISHA: I'm not afraid
of you killing him.

01:45:14.823 --> 01:45:15.904
LIAM: Neither am I.

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:22.880
ASHLEY: But is there
a possibility, though,

01:45:22.904 --> 01:45:23.880
that we would get out there

01:45:23.904 --> 01:45:28.673
and he would be
tempted by all of that?

01:45:28.697 --> 01:45:31.799
Then we would also have
to fight him, as well.

01:45:31.823 --> 01:45:33.880
MARISHA: But I think we can
use that to our advantage.

01:45:33.904 --> 01:45:36.880
The more that we know
people's motives and desires,

01:45:36.904 --> 01:45:38.405
the more we can play on that.

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.298
We're going in with the
advantage of knowing more

01:45:42.322 --> 01:45:45.489
than anybody, including
Ikithon, including--

01:45:46.904 --> 01:45:48.381
including Essek,

01:45:48.405 --> 01:45:50.447
from the discussions
that we've had.

01:45:51.864 --> 01:45:55.548
No one knows more than us and
the Tomb Takers, at this point.

01:45:55.572 --> 01:45:56.880
TRAVIS: And numbers are good.

01:45:56.904 --> 01:45:59.840
We need the numbers-- we have
them already, we need more.

01:45:59.864 --> 01:46:01.880
SAM: But also, you've
always wanted to go back

01:46:01.904 --> 01:46:05.197
and reshape your past with him

01:46:06.781 --> 01:46:09.840
and you can't, you know?

01:46:09.864 --> 01:46:10.904
There's no going back.

01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:15.030
So this might be the
closest thing that you get

01:46:17.405 --> 01:46:21.880
to change something
about how he views you

01:46:21.904 --> 01:46:23.197
or how you view him.

01:46:25.823 --> 01:46:26.947
LIAM: We can change something.

01:46:30.197 --> 01:46:32.880
SAM: You won't-- if
we survive all this,

01:46:32.904 --> 01:46:37.781
you won't be able to move
forward without that.

01:46:39.947 --> 01:46:43.656
Without sort of buttoning
up that part of your life.

01:46:49.904 --> 01:46:52.131
LIAM: Let's deal with
the problem on the table.

01:46:52.155 --> 01:46:54.048
SAM: Can maybe do both.

01:46:54.072 --> 01:46:54.904
LIAM: Maybe.

01:46:57.239 --> 01:47:00.447
We have a bullet
list of importance.

01:47:04.697 --> 01:47:07.072
One thing is required,
one thing is a bonus.

01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:14.880
MARISHA: To your point, let's
reach out to Essek, and who
knows?

01:47:14.904 --> 01:47:18.030
Maybe Ikithon will make
this decision easy for us.

01:47:20.823 --> 01:47:22.880
LIAM: Maybe we start
with Essek now,

01:47:22.904 --> 01:47:25.757
warn him of the complications.

01:47:25.781 --> 01:47:26.572
Get there,

01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:32.880
see if we still
take a gut check,

01:47:32.904 --> 01:47:34.256
see if we're still
on the same page,

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.340
and then reach out to them.

01:47:36.364 --> 01:47:39.507
LAURA: So I should ask Essek--
so I should say to Essek--

01:47:39.531 --> 01:47:41.465
what should I say to Essek?

01:47:41.489 --> 01:47:44.197
LIAM: He may be
under scrutiny now.

01:47:46.155 --> 01:47:47.322
We are looking to

01:47:48.904 --> 01:47:52.904
smooth those ruffles out
and potentially collaborate.

01:47:53.904 --> 01:47:55.090
TRAVIS: With--
LAURA: With Essek?

01:47:55.114 --> 01:47:56.507
TRAVIS and LIAM:
With the other side.

01:47:56.531 --> 01:47:58.673
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:47:58.697 --> 01:48:01.880
TRAVIS: And we'll be returning
soon, but I think he knows that.

01:48:01.904 --> 01:48:02.781
LAURA: Okay.

01:48:03.904 --> 01:48:06.215
LIAM: It's-- you
have very few words.

01:48:06.239 --> 01:48:07.006
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: It'd be helpful

01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:08.548
to know where he is, as well.

01:48:08.572 --> 01:48:09.340
LAURA: Essek?

01:48:09.364 --> 01:48:10.131
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: Well, I imagine

01:48:10.155 --> 01:48:12.298
Essek is probably still
where we left him.

01:48:12.322 --> 01:48:15.048
LIAM: Well, probably,
but let's not assume.

01:48:15.072 --> 01:48:15.904
LAURA: Okay.

01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:21.423
TRAVIS: God, you're a pro.

01:48:21.447 --> 01:48:23.465
I love watching you work.

01:48:23.489 --> 01:48:27.823
(laughter)

01:48:29.489 --> 01:48:30.280
Rawr.

01:48:32.656 --> 01:48:34.881
Push ups and my pecs, my
nips are just buck wild.

01:48:34.905 --> 01:48:36.715
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:48:36.739 --> 01:48:37.823
This is good.

01:48:39.947 --> 01:48:42.880
Can you, for every word,
like, flex your pec?

01:48:42.904 --> 01:48:45.507
Okay. Yeah, that's
how I'll count.

01:48:45.531 --> 01:48:46.423
MARISHA: I always
wanted to do that.

01:48:46.447 --> 01:48:47.447
LAURA: Okay.

01:48:49.697 --> 01:48:52.090
Oh no, I lost everything--

01:48:52.114 --> 01:48:54.880
TRAVIS: I know! They
shake you up, don't they?

01:48:54.904 --> 01:48:56.923
TALIESIN: I knew it! Ah!

01:48:56.947 --> 01:48:57.964
TRAVIS: Earth shaking!

01:48:57.988 --> 01:48:59.090
MATT: Let's be fair,
we were all hypnotized,

01:48:59.114 --> 01:49:01.131
I mean, let's-- we can be real.

01:49:01.155 --> 01:49:02.757
(laughter)

01:49:02.781 --> 01:49:03.880
TRAVIS: The rising sun.

01:49:03.904 --> 01:49:07.006
LAURA: Okay, everything I
want to say has a lot of extra

01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:08.904
words and I don't
know what-- okay.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.572
MARISHA: Dad bod be damned.

01:49:19.197 --> 01:49:23.280
LAURA: You may be
under scrutiny!

01:49:24.988 --> 01:49:26.880
SAM: Why are you so angry?

01:49:26.904 --> 01:49:29.880
(laughter)

01:49:29.904 --> 01:49:32.239
Does tone translate
on these things?

01:49:33.197 --> 01:49:36.423
TRAVIS: (confused, scared noise)
ASHLEY: It's like, "Why is she
so mad at me?"

01:49:36.447 --> 01:49:37.239
TALIESIN: That's her Shatner.

01:49:38.823 --> 01:49:42.881
LAURA: Ickythong could know

01:49:42.905 --> 01:49:44.988
about our involvement

01:49:46.823 --> 01:49:47.614
with you.

01:49:48.904 --> 01:49:51.881
He could be coming!

01:49:51.905 --> 01:49:54.904
Maybe you can help, though.

01:49:57.447 --> 01:49:58.697
Where are you now?

01:49:59.904 --> 01:50:02.131
MATT: I like to imagine he
dropped his coffee, as soon as
that hit him.

01:50:02.155 --> 01:50:05.507
TRAVIS: (splashing) Ah!
MATT: Just (startled noise).

01:50:05.531 --> 01:50:07.173
ASHLEY: You are under scrutiny!

01:50:07.197 --> 01:50:09.840
(laughter)

01:50:09.864 --> 01:50:11.298
MATT: The response
comes rapidly.

01:50:11.322 --> 01:50:12.923
MARISHA: Volume. Down.

01:50:12.947 --> 01:50:14.988
LIAM: He's like (electric
razor buzzing). Ah!

01:50:15.988 --> 01:50:20.947
MATT: "This is
challenging tidings.

01:50:25.322 --> 01:50:26.904
"Then I can not stay here long.

01:50:28.904 --> 01:50:30.155
"I am at the Outpost.

01:50:32.739 --> 01:50:35.340
"If you still need my help,

01:50:35.364 --> 01:50:40.090
"we should leave soon.

01:50:40.114 --> 01:50:40.964
"Soon."

01:50:40.988 --> 01:50:42.381
And that's all you get.

01:50:42.405 --> 01:50:43.880
LAURA: He's super nervous.

01:50:43.904 --> 01:50:45.340
He did not like that message.

01:50:45.364 --> 01:50:47.256
He wants to leave, like, stat.

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.880
We should probably
like bamf in there

01:50:49.904 --> 01:50:51.173
because he's going to run.

01:50:51.197 --> 01:50:52.757
I think he's going to bolt.

01:50:52.781 --> 01:50:55.298
SAM: He's that scared of Trent?
LAURA: He's super scared.

01:50:55.322 --> 01:50:58.215
Which is kind of
scary, if Essek,

01:50:58.239 --> 01:51:00.880
I don't know, like,
how powerful he is.

01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:01.880
I thought it's pretty powerful.

01:51:01.904 --> 01:51:03.006
He floats everywhere, you know?

01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:06.465
But if Ikithon is like way
more powerful than him, ooh.

01:51:06.489 --> 01:51:08.090
TRAVIS: Well, that and a
bunch of Volstruckers heading

01:51:08.114 --> 01:51:10.256
to an outpost in the
middle of nowhere

01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:12.131
where Essek might
be the top dog.

01:51:12.155 --> 01:51:13.215
Not great for him.

01:51:13.239 --> 01:51:14.322
LAURA: That's also true.

01:51:15.781 --> 01:51:16.673
LIAM: Let's go.

01:51:16.697 --> 01:51:18.298
So I can get us to the Outpost.

01:51:18.322 --> 01:51:20.173
I have a-- hold on.

01:51:20.197 --> 01:51:21.090
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

01:51:21.114 --> 01:51:24.006
LIAM: He rustles through his
bags and pulls out a little
piece

01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:26.880
of stone wrapped in parchment
with a little twine on it.

01:51:26.904 --> 01:51:28.715
This is from there.

01:51:28.739 --> 01:51:31.964
This will increase our chances,
there is room for error.

01:51:31.988 --> 01:51:34.155
TALIESIN: Is there anything
that we can do to help?

01:51:37.155 --> 01:51:38.880
LIAM: Massage is nice.

01:51:38.904 --> 01:51:40.904
I like tea.

01:51:41.904 --> 01:51:43.880
LAURA: Do we-- wait,
wait before we go.

01:51:43.904 --> 01:51:47.880
Hey, do we have
mercury, phosphorus,

01:51:47.904 --> 01:51:49.880
powdered diamond, and opal?

01:51:49.904 --> 01:51:50.880
LIAM: I have phosphorus.

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:51.799
LAURA: Okay.

01:51:51.823 --> 01:51:53.131
MARISHA: I bought some diamonds.

01:51:53.155 --> 01:51:54.757
LAURA: We've got diamonds.
MARISHA: They're tiny.

01:51:54.781 --> 01:51:55.880
LAURA: Do you have opals here?

01:51:55.904 --> 01:51:57.381
You probably have opals
here, this seems like a place

01:51:57.405 --> 01:51:58.215
that would have opals.

01:51:58.239 --> 01:52:00.880
TALIESIN: That's
presumptuous. No.

01:52:00.904 --> 01:52:02.799
LAURA: There's like-- look
at how shiny everything is.

01:52:02.823 --> 01:52:04.131
You probably got opals
under the ground.

01:52:04.155 --> 01:52:05.298
TALIESIN: No, we just cleaned.

01:52:05.322 --> 01:52:06.507
LIAM: What are you thinking?

01:52:06.531 --> 01:52:09.757
LAURA: Well, that's how
I-- the spell I want to do

01:52:09.781 --> 01:52:12.173
that would you lay like
a good trap, you know?

01:52:12.197 --> 01:52:13.590
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: It's really powerful.

01:52:13.614 --> 01:52:15.632
It needs opal and mercury

01:52:15.656 --> 01:52:17.632
and phosphorus and
diamonds powder.

01:52:17.656 --> 01:52:18.880
LIAM: Maybe Essek has some?

01:52:18.904 --> 01:52:20.880
SAM: Weren't we just
shopping yesterday?

01:52:20.904 --> 01:52:23.880
LAURA: I know. I--
can we time jump?

01:52:23.904 --> 01:52:26.715
(laughter)

01:52:26.739 --> 01:52:28.632
MATT: Unfortunately, you
jump through time that often

01:52:28.656 --> 01:52:30.757
and it begins to really
destabilize the continuum, so.

01:52:30.781 --> 01:52:31.548
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:52:31.572 --> 01:52:33.757
TALIESIN: There should be a
chronomancy spell where you can

01:52:33.781 --> 01:52:36.131
hop back to the last
time you went shopping.

01:52:36.155 --> 01:52:38.465
ASHLEY: And go get that one
thing. TALIESIN: Doctor Who
the--

01:52:38.489 --> 01:52:40.840
Once this is over, I'm going to
go back. LIAM: I'm working on
it, okay?!

01:52:40.864 --> 01:52:41.880
MATT: Yep.

01:52:41.904 --> 01:52:45.131
The 8th-level Bill and
Ted preparation spell.

01:52:45.155 --> 01:52:46.880
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Yes!

01:52:46.904 --> 01:52:48.904
TALIESIN: I'm glad
you're on the same page.

01:52:51.447 --> 01:52:53.090
LIAM: Well, it sounds
like there's no opal here.

01:52:53.114 --> 01:52:55.131
TRAVIS: Nope.
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

01:52:55.155 --> 01:52:56.799
LIAM: Maybe Essek has some,

01:52:56.823 --> 01:52:58.715
maybe they have some
at that outpost.

01:52:58.739 --> 01:53:01.340
LAURA: I mean, we
do have residuum.

01:53:01.364 --> 01:53:02.131
SAM: Yeah.

01:53:02.155 --> 01:53:05.173
LAURA: So that can take the
place of opal and mercury.

01:53:05.197 --> 01:53:06.256
MATT: Mm-hm.
LIAM: There you go.

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:09.572
LAURA: We just need a lot of
diamond dust to make up for it.

01:53:10.572 --> 01:53:12.256
MARISHA: We've got
those, like, what was it?

01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:13.880
150? 300? 150?

01:53:13.904 --> 01:53:15.880
It was 150 gold worth
of tiny diamonds?

01:53:15.904 --> 01:53:18.799
LAURA: This thing takes a
thousand gold's worth of stuff,

01:53:18.823 --> 01:53:22.215
but it doesn't say like,
you know, the portion.

01:53:22.239 --> 01:53:25.590
So it could be like a tiny
little amount of everything.

01:53:25.614 --> 01:53:29.507
And then like a 999
gold of diamonds.

01:53:29.531 --> 01:53:30.423
TALIESIN: Hold on.

01:53:30.447 --> 01:53:31.739
(yelling) Calliope, you up?!

01:53:32.864 --> 01:53:33.632
Are you up?!

01:53:33.656 --> 01:53:34.423
MARISHA: She is now.

01:53:34.447 --> 01:53:36.215
LAURA: Calliope, we're naked!

01:53:36.239 --> 01:53:38.072
TALIESIN: (yelling)
Calliope, are you up?!

01:53:38.947 --> 01:53:41.964
MATT: You hear something
get thrown out of the front

01:53:41.988 --> 01:53:45.507
of the actual temple
and ping, ping, ping.

01:53:45.531 --> 01:53:47.781
TALIESIN: (yelling) Are you up?!
MATT: "What?!"

01:53:49.239 --> 01:53:50.881
TALIESIN: I can keep
yelling or you can come out.

01:53:50.905 --> 01:53:52.072
MATT: She stomps out.

01:53:54.697 --> 01:53:55.632
"What?"

01:53:55.656 --> 01:53:57.298
TALIESIN: Well, we're
in a bit of a pickle

01:53:57.322 --> 01:54:00.840
and we were-- I was wondering
if you had any components

01:54:00.864 --> 01:54:02.840
lying around, gems.

01:54:02.864 --> 01:54:04.340
I know that
occasionally you dabble,

01:54:04.364 --> 01:54:08.757
if there's any-- anything
that I can borrow?

01:54:08.781 --> 01:54:10.673
MATT: "And what kind of
gems are you looking for?"

01:54:10.697 --> 01:54:11.880
TRAVIS: Give us your 1,000 gold.

01:54:11.904 --> 01:54:13.423
TALIESIN: Opal, opal--

01:54:13.447 --> 01:54:16.880
LAURA: Opal, diamond
dust, phosphorus, mercury.

01:54:16.904 --> 01:54:17.880
TALIESIN: Things like that.

01:54:17.904 --> 01:54:19.881
MATT: "You all may be a
little rich for my blood,

01:54:19.905 --> 01:54:22.548
"but I may have an opal
or two, I can check."

01:54:22.572 --> 01:54:23.572
TALIESIN: That'd be amazing.

01:54:25.904 --> 01:54:28.632
MATT: "You can get
dressed when you like to--

01:54:28.656 --> 01:54:30.447
"if you want to
talk in the house."

01:54:32.114 --> 01:54:34.090
TALIESIN: She's messing
with us, it's fine.

01:54:34.114 --> 01:54:35.531
MATT: She walks into the house.

01:54:36.823 --> 01:54:38.799
TALIESIN: I'm going to
go collect some stuff.

01:54:38.823 --> 01:54:39.590
I'll be right back.

01:54:39.614 --> 01:54:41.006
MATT: Which spell is this
you're going to be looking for?

01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:42.673
LAURA: This is for Symbol.

01:54:42.697 --> 01:54:43.904
MATT: Symbol.

01:54:45.656 --> 01:54:47.632
SAM: ♪ (hi-hat sizzling) ♪

01:54:47.656 --> 01:54:48.904
TALIESIN: ♪ (drumset fill) ♪

01:54:50.197 --> 01:54:51.880
ASHLEY: ♪ (drumset fill) ♪

01:54:51.904 --> 01:54:52.715
MATT: Short time after,

01:54:52.739 --> 01:54:55.904
you do convene with Calliope.

01:54:56.904 --> 01:55:00.173
And she has two opals
worth about 100 gold each.

01:55:00.197 --> 01:55:01.215
SAM: Hey.
LAURA: Oh, great.

01:55:01.239 --> 01:55:04.880
MATT: They were part
of a piece of armor

01:55:04.904 --> 01:55:06.880
that she had
designed for herself.

01:55:06.904 --> 01:55:08.697
And so she's like,

01:55:09.904 --> 01:55:13.697
"I take it what you're doing
is pretty important, right?"

01:55:14.823 --> 01:55:15.964
TALIESIN: It's very important.

01:55:15.988 --> 01:55:17.256
MATT: And she gets
one of her tools

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:19.880
and bends the metal
back to relieve--

01:55:19.904 --> 01:55:21.215
And you look at them,
the opals have been

01:55:21.239 --> 01:55:22.880
carved through a little
bit in the center

01:55:22.904 --> 01:55:24.880
to go ahead and give
them a place to slide

01:55:24.904 --> 01:55:27.840
onto the armor decoratively,
and so she removes them.

01:55:27.864 --> 01:55:29.799
They might've been worth more
before she had done that,

01:55:29.823 --> 01:55:32.632
but roughly, it comes
about a 100 gold each

01:55:32.656 --> 01:55:34.405
of worth as they currently sit.

01:55:37.322 --> 01:55:38.880
TALIESIN: Just as an apology,

01:55:38.904 --> 01:55:41.715
I know you can go back to
town and get some more.

01:55:41.739 --> 01:55:44.656
I'm just going to give
her like 350 gold.

01:55:45.447 --> 01:55:46.239
MATT: She takes it.

01:55:47.905 --> 01:55:48.923
"A fair trade."

01:55:48.947 --> 01:55:49.880
TALIESIN: I'm really sorry.

01:55:49.904 --> 01:55:51.155
MATT: "It's fine.

01:55:52.656 --> 01:55:55.715
"I can probably do a better
job the second round anyway."

01:55:55.739 --> 01:55:57.880
LAURA: Or are you putting that
in your inventory, or--?
TALIESIN: No, you put in yours,

01:55:57.904 --> 01:55:59.904
I'm just-- I'm paying
out of my pocket.

01:56:02.572 --> 01:56:05.298
MATT: The rest of the
Clay family begins to

01:56:05.322 --> 01:56:06.715
gather, those that were there,

01:56:06.739 --> 01:56:09.507
as you all start getting
your things ready

01:56:09.531 --> 01:56:10.697
and as they all

01:56:12.364 --> 01:56:14.823
collect across from all of you,

01:56:16.904 --> 01:56:18.823
Cornelius looks over and says,

01:56:20.072 --> 01:56:21.155
"Well, I...

01:56:23.614 --> 01:56:25.880
"it's not often we get
friends in this area.

01:56:25.904 --> 01:56:29.239
"So, it's nice to have
some friendly faces over.

01:56:30.904 --> 01:56:33.632
"From what your mother tells me,

01:56:33.656 --> 01:56:37.131
"you have quite a
bit ahead of you.

01:56:37.155 --> 01:56:41.465
"So may the Wild Mother
go with all of you."

01:56:41.489 --> 01:56:44.072
Looks over to Constance,

01:56:45.572 --> 01:56:47.381
who looks at everyone
quietly for a minute

01:56:47.405 --> 01:56:52.405
and, you know, Caduceus
definitely has that,

01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:57.381
that warm look that just
reads your soul at times,

01:56:57.405 --> 01:57:01.880
that very intense,
not challenging,

01:57:01.904 --> 01:57:04.131
but just exposed
sensation that this person

01:57:04.155 --> 01:57:08.006
can see through
any fronts you put.

01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:10.673
You see where he gets it from,

01:57:10.697 --> 01:57:12.715
as his mother makes eye
contact with each of you.

01:57:12.739 --> 01:57:16.256
And it's-- it's a very
raw and emotional look

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:18.904
of-- without words-- saying,

01:57:20.988 --> 01:57:23.030
"Take care of yourself."

01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:26.531
As she looks across
all of you and nods,

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.173
the family looks at each other

01:57:30.197 --> 01:57:32.880
and they all just step forward
and give this giant embrace

01:57:32.904 --> 01:57:34.904
around Caduceus,
just all of them

01:57:35.864 --> 01:57:39.904
putting their arms around,
just one big family huddle.

01:57:44.447 --> 01:57:45.904
Once they pull back,

01:57:46.904 --> 01:57:48.880
your mother takes a
necklace off of her neck

01:57:48.904 --> 01:57:53.904
and you see it's this
beautiful gold woven cord.

01:57:54.697 --> 01:57:59.298
And at the bottom of it,
there is a sculpted icon

01:57:59.322 --> 01:58:03.048
of the Wild Mother,
this beautiful wreath.

01:58:03.072 --> 01:58:08.072
And you can see, it's
polished and it's fired,

01:58:09.864 --> 01:58:12.880
but it was once,
you recognize it,

01:58:12.904 --> 01:58:15.781
the material from the
base of the pond here,

01:58:16.823 --> 01:58:18.697
made of itself in clay

01:58:19.697 --> 01:58:21.405
and she places it
around your neck.

01:58:23.447 --> 01:58:26.114
"That way, a little part
of us goes with you, too.

01:58:27.739 --> 01:58:28.904
"A little part of home."

01:58:29.947 --> 01:58:31.197
TALIESIN: That's all I want.

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:34.155
Thank you, Mom.

01:58:38.947 --> 01:58:41.799
MATT: (as Constance)
"When you all come back,

01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:42.715
"let us know in advance

01:58:42.739 --> 01:58:45.507
"and we can cook a proper meal.

01:58:45.531 --> 01:58:48.256
"We'll send for some
of the good southern

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.489
"vegetables that are
harder to get up here."

01:58:53.823 --> 01:58:56.131
TALIESIN: We'll show you
our house also next time.

01:58:56.155 --> 01:58:56.988
It's really nice.

01:58:58.072 --> 01:59:00.757
MATT: They all nod, wide-eyed

01:59:00.781 --> 01:59:03.632
and you can see Clarabelle,

01:59:03.656 --> 01:59:05.507
"Is that the one with
the tree on top?"

01:59:05.531 --> 01:59:07.880
TALIESIN: No, no.
There's another one.

01:59:07.904 --> 01:59:09.507
MATT: "You have two houses?"

01:59:09.531 --> 01:59:10.880
TALIESIN: It's pretty crazy.

01:59:10.904 --> 01:59:13.298
MATT: She looks at
her mom and dad like,

01:59:13.322 --> 01:59:17.673
(as Cornelius) "When you're
older, it's a long ways away."

01:59:17.697 --> 01:59:18.904
TALIESIN: It'll be there.

01:59:19.904 --> 01:59:20.697
MATT: "Well.

01:59:22.864 --> 01:59:23.864
"Good luck."

01:59:25.155 --> 01:59:29.030
They all hold hands and
wait to see you off.

01:59:30.614 --> 01:59:34.423
SAM: I'm going to go up to
Constance and just ask her:

01:59:34.447 --> 01:59:37.197
If-- if your son
doesn't come back or

01:59:38.114 --> 01:59:40.614
if you don't hear from
him again for a while,

01:59:42.739 --> 01:59:46.072
can you take this and send it?
There's instructions on it.

01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:50.904
Can you send it to my
son and to my family?

01:59:51.904 --> 01:59:53.880
MATT: "Where would
we find them?"

01:59:53.904 --> 01:59:56.215
SAM: I wrote-- I wrote
down where they are.

01:59:56.239 --> 02:00:00.280
It's-- it's a dive
bar in Zadash.

02:00:02.447 --> 02:00:04.048
MATT: She places it
into a little side pouch

02:00:04.072 --> 02:00:07.590
that she has, with other
squishy bits of moss.

02:00:07.614 --> 02:00:09.799
She clasps her
hands around yours

02:00:09.823 --> 02:00:13.173
and she is, like
her son, very tall.

02:00:13.197 --> 02:00:15.715
So she kneels down
and very low to get

02:00:15.739 --> 02:00:18.614
to your eye level and cups
her hands around yours.

02:00:20.364 --> 02:00:21.405
"Of course."

02:00:23.072 --> 02:00:27.904
SAM: Thank you, and I'll try to
take care of your son for you.

02:00:28.904 --> 02:00:30.072
MATT: "Please do."

02:00:33.197 --> 02:00:35.904
And she pulls you in and
whispers in your ear.

02:00:42.823 --> 02:00:43.904
"What you're doing

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:49.322
"is the definition of bravery.

02:00:51.947 --> 02:00:54.447
"A mother would give
anything to protect her son.

02:00:57.947 --> 02:00:59.904
"I don't have that strength,

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:03.322
"but you do."

02:01:06.447 --> 02:01:07.656
She pulls back.

02:01:11.905 --> 02:01:14.531
SAM: I'll try to
live up to that.

02:01:16.904 --> 02:01:17.904
Thank you.

02:01:24.447 --> 02:01:25.239
MATT: So?

02:01:29.364 --> 02:01:30.280
LIAM: One more time,

02:01:31.904 --> 02:01:33.197
are you sure?

02:01:34.904 --> 02:01:36.447
SAM: No,

02:01:37.572 --> 02:01:39.739
but I'm going to do it anyway.

02:01:40.904 --> 02:01:42.904
That's what we're
all doing, right?

02:01:43.904 --> 02:01:45.880
Are you all sure?

02:01:45.904 --> 02:01:47.173
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:01:47.197 --> 02:01:48.880
SAM: Well, you're
the only one, then.

02:01:48.904 --> 02:01:50.381
TALIESIN: No, I'm with you. No.

02:01:50.405 --> 02:01:52.507
LAURA: I'm sure I want to go.

02:01:52.531 --> 02:01:54.072
LIAM: Gather in close, please.

02:01:56.656 --> 02:01:59.090
I promise to do everything
in my power to get you back

02:01:59.114 --> 02:02:00.880
to Yeza and Luc.

02:02:00.904 --> 02:02:02.880
And I have that little
bit of stonework

02:02:02.904 --> 02:02:05.548
from the Outpost and I
take Veth by the hand

02:02:05.572 --> 02:02:06.799
and clasp our hands together

02:02:06.823 --> 02:02:09.197
and the stone is held
between our hands.

02:02:11.155 --> 02:02:15.340
Veth the Brave, let's
you and I do our best

02:02:15.364 --> 02:02:17.114
to keep all these
families together.

02:02:18.239 --> 02:02:20.280
And I mutter a word
and we're gone.

02:02:21.739 --> 02:02:24.173
LAURA: Dang, I wish you
would've taken us with them.

02:02:24.197 --> 02:02:27.880
(laughter)

02:02:27.904 --> 02:02:30.507
ASHLEY: Wait!
(laughter)

02:02:30.531 --> 02:02:32.904
TRAVIS: How many can you
carry with your wings?

02:02:34.614 --> 02:02:37.131
ASHLEY: I can probably
get us to Eiselcross.

02:02:37.155 --> 02:02:39.880
MATT: That familiar
sensation of being pulled,

02:02:39.904 --> 02:02:42.256
plucked from the point
in space where you were,

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.131
and suddenly thrown
through invisible doors

02:02:45.155 --> 02:02:47.381
to a space in the distance.

02:02:47.405 --> 02:02:48.905
And with that, we'll
take our break.

02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:54.155
We'll be back here in a few
minutes to pick it up from here.

02:02:54.904 --> 02:02:57.697
(dramatic music)

02:03:00.614 --> 02:03:03.131
Dwarvenite

02:03:03.155 --> 02:03:06.947
the most precious substance
among dwarven smiths,

02:03:08.904 --> 02:03:12.697
able to absorb the very
spirit of the craftsman.

02:03:19.322 --> 02:03:24.322
Thus infused, it becomes
nearly indestructible,

02:03:26.739 --> 02:03:30.405
able to forge heirlooms that
will last for generations.

02:03:32.864 --> 02:03:35.114
(ax smashes)

02:03:41.155 --> 02:03:42.572
Pure dwarvenite.

02:03:43.781 --> 02:03:48.715
Now you can get your hands
on this legendary substance

02:03:48.739 --> 02:03:51.489
with the new Dungeon of Doom,

02:03:53.405 --> 02:03:55.904
available now at
DwarvenForge.com.

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.904
(light music)

02:04:07.905 --> 02:04:10.905
(typewriter clicks)

02:04:14.904 --> 02:04:17.864
(music continues)

02:04:32.904 --> 02:04:34.880
LAURA: Hey, Critters,
Laura Bailey here.

02:04:34.904 --> 02:04:37.447
Let's see what's up in
the Critical Role shop.

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:41.904
Oh, my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:04:45.904 --> 02:04:48.280
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

02:04:51.904 --> 02:04:54.072
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:04:56.364 --> 02:04:59.904
Oh, goody, you can look
just like my brother.

02:05:02.947 --> 02:05:05.256
I mean, the Traveler always
says impulse purchases

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:06.531
are a good decision.

02:05:09.197 --> 02:05:11.447
So click on over to
the Critical Role shop.

02:05:12.405 --> 02:05:14.340
Don't worry, there's a few
more minutes in the break.

02:05:14.364 --> 02:05:15.904
You still got time.

02:05:19.947 --> 02:05:22.572
(birds chirp)

02:05:25.489 --> 02:05:27.632
I'm a fan of hot
air balloon rides

02:05:27.656 --> 02:05:29.614
above the Venetian countryside.

02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:32.632
I'm a fan of Momlan.

02:05:32.656 --> 02:05:34.197
She's always got my back.

02:05:35.656 --> 02:05:38.447
I'm a fan of wine
older that Taliesin.

02:05:40.904 --> 02:05:42.904
I'm a fan of Twitch
subscriptions.

02:05:45.114 --> 02:05:47.757
I'm a fan of emotes
by our Squeef.

02:05:47.781 --> 02:05:48.572
They're neat.

02:05:49.904 --> 02:05:52.215
I'm a fan of a wife so cool

02:05:52.239 --> 02:05:56.048
people forget I exist. (echoes)

02:05:56.072 --> 02:05:59.298
(ominous music)

02:05:59.322 --> 02:06:02.864
(dramatic sound effects)

02:06:08.947 --> 02:06:12.298
(heart beats)

02:06:12.322 --> 02:06:14.864
(baby cries)

02:06:20.739 --> 02:06:24.489
I'm a fan of wearing
your skin as a mask.

02:06:29.322 --> 02:06:31.904
(light music)

02:18:34.928 --> 02:18:36.155
MATT: And welcome back.

02:18:36.179 --> 02:18:39.405
(laughter)

02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:40.552
Last we left off--

02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:44.528
was before break, so
we're back from it.

02:18:44.552 --> 02:18:45.471
Hey guys.

02:18:46.512 --> 02:18:47.654
MARISHA: Hi.
LAURA: (laughing) Hi.

02:18:47.678 --> 02:18:48.528
LIAM: Oh hi.

02:18:48.552 --> 02:18:51.552
MATT: As you are plucked
from the Blooming Grove,

02:18:54.387 --> 02:18:55.779
I need you to go ahead and roll.

02:18:55.803 --> 02:18:56.571
SAM: Oh boy.

02:18:56.595 --> 02:18:57.738
MATT: See where your feet fall.

02:18:57.762 --> 02:18:58.529
LIAM: Yeah.

02:18:58.553 --> 02:18:59.612
TRAVIS: We're fine,
we're fine, we're fine,

02:18:59.636 --> 02:19:00.528
we're fine, we're fine,

02:19:00.552 --> 02:19:01.488
the campaign's over.
ASHLEY: I don't want to leave

02:19:01.512 --> 02:19:02.612
this beautiful place.

02:19:02.636 --> 02:19:03.696
SAM: Can you do--
MARISHA: I know.

02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:05.321
SAM: Can you do fate--

02:19:05.345 --> 02:19:07.528
what is it called,
Fate/stay night, what is it?

02:19:07.552 --> 02:19:08.612
TRAVIS: Fate/stay night?

02:19:08.636 --> 02:19:10.280
SAM: Fate's Favor.
LIAM: Name some more anime.

02:19:10.304 --> 02:19:15.196
More anime, Boys B,
come on, KO Beast.

02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:17.179
TRAVIS: Wolf's Rain, Big O.

02:19:19.137 --> 02:19:20.762
SAM: Can you kamikaze yourself?

02:19:21.887 --> 02:19:23.012
Death Note.

02:19:25.512 --> 02:19:26.988
LIAM: Okay, so it's--

02:19:27.012 --> 02:19:28.946
Oh, that's okay I
had it upside down.

02:19:28.970 --> 02:19:30.528
65.

02:19:30.552 --> 02:19:32.821
MATT: 65.
SAM: Butterflies.

02:19:32.845 --> 02:19:35.155
TRAVIS: I think it might be.

02:19:35.179 --> 02:19:36.363
LIAM: Yeah, it was
in the 60s, yeah.

02:19:36.387 --> 02:19:38.363
LAURA: No, I thought
it was in the 30s.

02:19:38.387 --> 02:19:41.488
LIAM: We're seeing if we fuse
with a slab of stone right now.

02:19:41.512 --> 02:19:42.363
TRAVIS: But butterflies.

02:19:42.387 --> 02:19:43.821
MARISHA: Is it butterflies?

02:19:43.845 --> 02:19:44.988
MATT: What, the--?

02:19:45.012 --> 02:19:47.029
MARISHA: What happened?

02:19:47.053 --> 02:19:47.821
MATT: 65, you said?

02:19:47.845 --> 02:19:49.012
SAM and LIAM: Yes.

02:19:51.304 --> 02:19:52.071
SAM: Did he just roll?

02:19:52.095 --> 02:19:52.863
LAURA: He did.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:19:52.887 --> 02:19:54.528
TRAVIS: No, he put his--
MATT: I put my phone down.

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:55.528
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:19:55.552 --> 02:19:56.803
LIAM: Likely story.

02:19:59.552 --> 02:20:02.696
MATT: As you're suddenly
pulled from the grove,

02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:04.654
there is a momentary push

02:20:04.678 --> 02:20:06.863
like someone's pushing
you from behind,

02:20:06.887 --> 02:20:08.029
or pulling you
from your sternum,

02:20:08.053 --> 02:20:09.970
you're not sure where
it's coming from.

02:20:11.552 --> 02:20:15.429
And in a flash, an abrupt
sensation hits you all at once.

02:20:17.803 --> 02:20:19.155
Cold.

02:20:19.179 --> 02:20:21.636
(wind blowing)
SAM: (quietly) That's good.

02:20:23.262 --> 02:20:25.471
MATT: No snow, but
a very cold breeze.

02:20:26.845 --> 02:20:30.095
Looking around you,
it is a cloudy day,

02:20:31.636 --> 02:20:32.552
but...

02:20:34.012 --> 02:20:36.071
you have arrived without issue.

02:20:36.095 --> 02:20:37.029
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Oh.

02:20:37.053 --> 02:20:37.821
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:20:37.845 --> 02:20:41.053
MATT: It seems to Eiselcross,
<i>because</i> you had that
object.

02:20:42.552 --> 02:20:45.552
Because that would have been
a very different scenario.

02:20:46.552 --> 02:20:48.636
LIAM: (high-pitched voice)
Don't forget to grab a rock.

02:20:51.552 --> 02:20:54.029
TRAVIS: What would it
have been, I need to know!

02:20:54.053 --> 02:20:55.904
MARISHA: -- the
alternate timeline!

02:20:55.928 --> 02:20:58.512
MATT: Well, no, you don't know.

02:20:59.345 --> 02:21:00.738
Well, the good-- you didn't--

02:21:00.762 --> 02:21:02.029
you're not on-target,
I'll put you that,

02:21:02.053 --> 02:21:03.528
because as you guys land
and look around you,

02:21:03.552 --> 02:21:05.512
you do not see the
Outpost anywhere.

02:21:06.887 --> 02:21:11.280
LIAM: Okay, well north, north
is that way so we know that.

02:21:11.304 --> 02:21:12.528
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: I can do a thing.

02:21:12.552 --> 02:21:13.528
MATT: You can just see--
LAURA: Do a thing!

02:21:13.552 --> 02:21:16.528
MATT: -- open, white
snow and ice around you.

02:21:16.552 --> 02:21:17.488
LAURA: What are you going to do?

02:21:17.512 --> 02:21:19.528
TALIESIN: I cast Find the Path.

02:21:19.552 --> 02:21:20.696
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: It's the only time

02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.238
this spell is good.

02:21:22.262 --> 02:21:23.405
MARISHA: It's 100% true.

02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:24.528
MATT: It's come in
handy a couple times.

02:21:24.552 --> 02:21:25.654
Search For Grog it did.

02:21:25.678 --> 02:21:26.988
LAURA: Oh yeah.
MARISHA: Oh, that's true.

02:21:27.012 --> 02:21:28.113
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

02:21:28.137 --> 02:21:29.238
MATT: Twice.

02:21:29.262 --> 02:21:31.488
(laughter)

02:21:31.512 --> 02:21:34.528
TALIESIN: So as soon as we
can find some sort of landmark

02:21:34.552 --> 02:21:35.447
we'll know where we are,

02:21:35.471 --> 02:21:40.321
but in the meantime, I
know the cardinal direction

02:21:40.345 --> 02:21:43.528
to where we're going,
which is that way.

02:21:43.552 --> 02:21:45.196
It's that way.

02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:47.696
LAURA: Okay, let's
head that direction.

02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:50.405
TALIESIN: So there could
be a mountain in the way.

02:21:50.429 --> 02:21:51.738
LAURA: We'll find
out soon enough.

02:21:51.762 --> 02:21:53.488
LIAM: Well, hold on a minute.

02:21:53.512 --> 02:21:56.946
If we know where the Outpost
is because it's that way,

02:21:56.970 --> 02:21:59.280
and we know where north
is because of Keen Mind.

02:21:59.304 --> 02:22:00.113
MATT: Yes.

02:22:00.137 --> 02:22:03.405
LIAM: So we should know if
we are east of the Outpost

02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:06.904
or west of the Outpost or--
judging by the direction.

02:22:06.928 --> 02:22:10.113
MATT: You are southwest
from the Outpost.

02:22:10.137 --> 02:22:11.363
LIAM: Okay.

02:22:11.387 --> 02:22:12.155
LAURA: So no mountain in
the way. SAM: Is that near

02:22:12.179 --> 02:22:14.571
one of the other
numbers by any chance?

02:22:14.595 --> 02:22:15.612
TRAVIS: No.

02:22:15.636 --> 02:22:17.528
Aeor--
SAM: The "A"s?

02:22:17.552 --> 02:22:20.528
TRAVIS: Aeor, A2, and we're down
here, which is also where the
lava river is.

02:22:20.552 --> 02:22:22.447
SAM: There's no "A5"
or "A?" where we are?

02:22:22.471 --> 02:22:24.137
TRAVIS: All east, far, far east.

02:22:25.012 --> 02:22:26.863
SAM: Do we have to cross
the lava thing again?

02:22:26.887 --> 02:22:28.321
TRAVIS: We might be on
the other side of it.

02:22:28.345 --> 02:22:29.946
ASHLEY: Oh, good grief.
TRAVIS: Southwest could be--

02:22:29.970 --> 02:22:32.280
LIAM: Yeah, we could
be, that's correct.

02:22:32.304 --> 02:22:34.196
LAURA: We could fly over it.
TALIESIN: I burned what I got.

02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:35.238
SAM: We could fly over it.

02:22:35.262 --> 02:22:38.988
MATT: Yeah, this is considered
an "off-target" result.

02:22:39.012 --> 02:22:40.528
LIAM: Better than--

02:22:40.552 --> 02:22:41.821
LAURA: In the middle
of a mountain.

02:22:41.845 --> 02:22:44.654
MATT: Better than a lot of
possibilities there, so.

02:22:44.678 --> 02:22:46.363
TRAVIS: <i>In</i> the lava.

02:22:46.387 --> 02:22:47.488
MATT: Take it where
you can get it.

02:22:47.512 --> 02:22:48.946
SAM: Oh, but Laura
wanted to go back in time

02:22:48.970 --> 02:22:51.220
and take that rock
away from Liam.

02:22:52.595 --> 02:22:54.654
She did that last
night before we left.

02:22:54.678 --> 02:22:55.988
MATT: Gotcha,
gotcha, okay, cool.

02:22:56.012 --> 02:22:57.528
LAURA: I switched it
with another rock.

02:22:57.552 --> 02:23:00.262
TRAVIS: (as Jester) How stupid
to bring a rock in his coat.

02:23:01.137 --> 02:23:02.821
LIAM: Why does this
stone have a smiley face?

02:23:02.845 --> 02:23:04.321
Is this a pet rock?!

02:23:04.345 --> 02:23:05.696
No!

02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:08.405
MATT: Well, first off, can
I have a marching order?

02:23:08.429 --> 02:23:10.528
LAURA: Oh, well, you should lead

02:23:10.552 --> 02:23:13.321
because, you know.
TALIESIN: I'll go first.

02:23:13.345 --> 02:23:14.528
MATT: All right,
Caduceus at the front.

02:23:14.552 --> 02:23:15.863
TRAVIS: I'll join
Caduceus up there.

02:23:15.887 --> 02:23:18.654
MATT: All right, Caduceus
and Fjord in the front.

02:23:18.678 --> 02:23:20.528
ASHLEY: I'll go next.

02:23:20.552 --> 02:23:22.528
MATT: All righty, anybody
else along with Yasha?

02:23:22.552 --> 02:23:24.488
LIAM: Squishy wizard
in the middle.

02:23:24.512 --> 02:23:26.238
SAM: I'll go on the end.
TRAVIS: Jester.

02:23:26.262 --> 02:23:27.696
LAURA: Well, I know, I
was trying to separate

02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:28.904
the clerics.
MATT: It's an open space.

02:23:28.928 --> 02:23:30.738
You guys can be in any

02:23:30.762 --> 02:23:32.696
organization you want to be.
LAURA: I'll go right next to
Yasha.

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:33.988
I'll be behind Fjord.

02:23:34.012 --> 02:23:36.528
MARISHA: I'll bring
up the rear with Veth.

02:23:36.552 --> 02:23:39.196
MATT: All righty, squishy
wizard in the middle indeed.

02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:40.738
You've got it.

02:23:40.762 --> 02:23:41.553
Okay.

02:23:43.762 --> 02:23:45.405
With the direction you're given,

02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:49.113
you are now heading in
a northeastern direction

02:23:49.137 --> 02:23:50.738
and after you get yourself
adjusted you could see

02:23:50.762 --> 02:23:53.904
there's a mountain
range to the east

02:23:53.928 --> 02:23:55.528
of where you currently are.

02:23:55.552 --> 02:23:57.488
A number of miles off
you can just see it.

02:23:57.512 --> 02:23:59.113
You can't quite tell
the full distance,

02:23:59.137 --> 02:24:01.571
but you're directing in
a northeastern direction.

02:24:01.595 --> 02:24:03.946
TALIESIN: There's no lava river
that we can see between us

02:24:03.970 --> 02:24:05.762
and the mountain?
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:24:08.552 --> 02:24:11.155
TALIESIN: That's
pretty good, 29.

02:24:11.179 --> 02:24:14.196
MATT: You do not see
any sign of a lava river

02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:17.196
between you and that
mountain range at the moment.

02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:19.512
LIAM: If there's a mountain
range to our east--

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:23.696
TALIESIN: Right.
LIAM: -- we are probably

02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:26.196
on the right side of the
lava river, probably.

02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:28.821
TALIESIN: Yes, that
would be my guess.

02:24:28.845 --> 02:24:30.988
MARISHA: Yeah, would
we know that a little?

02:24:31.012 --> 02:24:34.988
Like, would I remember that?

02:24:35.012 --> 02:24:36.528
MATT: Well, you have a map.

02:24:36.552 --> 02:24:37.654
MARISHA: Or we can
just look at the map.

02:24:37.678 --> 02:24:39.762
TALIESIN: I kind
of remember that.

02:24:40.970 --> 02:24:42.512
LIAM: I've been looking at it.

02:24:44.512 --> 02:24:47.280
TRAVIS: That's the
Happy Fun Ball.

02:24:47.304 --> 02:24:48.528
LAURA: Don't throw that!

02:24:48.552 --> 02:24:49.928
TRAVIS: It's
somewhere around here.

02:24:51.512 --> 02:24:54.654
LIAM: There's nowhere really
that is southwest of the
Outpost--

02:24:54.678 --> 02:24:56.988
LAURA: I like to
think Fjord's just--

02:24:57.012 --> 02:24:58.988
LIAM: -- that would have
mountain range to the east

02:24:59.012 --> 02:25:01.196
except for one or two
places and they're both

02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:02.904
on the good side
of the lava river.

02:25:02.928 --> 02:25:04.863
LAURA: We discuss as we
continue walking forward.

02:25:04.887 --> 02:25:05.887
MATT: Of course.

02:25:06.803 --> 02:25:09.238
Well, as you figure out the--

02:25:09.262 --> 02:25:10.053
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:13.528
MARISHA: ♪ Too many maps ♪

02:25:13.552 --> 02:25:15.528
LAURA and MARISHA:
♪ Too many maps ♪

02:25:15.552 --> 02:25:16.552
TRAVIS: There it is.

02:25:18.053 --> 02:25:19.528
There's a lot.

02:25:19.552 --> 02:25:21.095
Come on, you fuckin' bitch!

02:25:22.552 --> 02:25:24.113
MATT: Love watching Travis
battle over there. ASHLEY: ♪
Mapmaker mapmaker ♪

02:25:24.137 --> 02:25:25.779
♪ Make me a map ♪
LAURA: I don't think that's it.

02:25:25.803 --> 02:25:27.528
TALIESIN: Oh, actually
I do know how far it is

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:28.528
when I cast the spell.

02:25:28.552 --> 02:25:29.654
I know how far it is.

02:25:29.678 --> 02:25:31.528
MATT: You do?

02:25:31.552 --> 02:25:33.029
TRAVIS: You do?
TALIESIN: I do.

02:25:33.053 --> 02:25:35.779
TRAVIS: And after I get
the map out, you bastard.

02:25:35.803 --> 02:25:37.970
TALIESIN: Wasn't going to say
it before you had the map up.

02:25:41.552 --> 02:25:43.528
MARISHA: Testing the map.

02:25:43.552 --> 02:25:44.612
TALIESIN: Yep, that's a map.

02:25:44.636 --> 02:25:46.946
MATT: "How far it is and what
direction it lies," all right.

02:25:46.970 --> 02:25:51.528
Let me do some
math here because--

02:25:51.552 --> 02:25:52.696
SAM: Ashley, help him.

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:54.363
TALIESIN: Ish, I mean,
you can give me an ish.

02:25:54.387 --> 02:25:56.405
ASHLEY: I can help you,
I got fingers to count.

02:25:56.429 --> 02:25:57.528
TALIESIN: You can tell
me in, like, day's travel

02:25:57.552 --> 02:26:00.280
if we didn't have to
go over a mountain.

02:26:00.304 --> 02:26:01.196
TRAVIS: There are eight maps.

02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:02.970
MATT: I will say it's about...

02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:06.738
at your current location,

02:26:06.762 --> 02:26:07.946
between two and
three days' travel.

02:26:07.970 --> 02:26:09.071
LAURA and LIAM: (shocked gasp)

02:26:09.095 --> 02:26:11.196
TALIESIN: Between two
and three days' travel.

02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:13.612
LAURA: That is so much
farther than what I thought.

02:26:13.636 --> 02:26:14.738
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we're down by

02:26:14.762 --> 02:26:16.904
Allowak's Sanctuary.
LIAM: Oh, we're deep southwest.

02:26:16.928 --> 02:26:18.029
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:26:18.053 --> 02:26:20.196
LIAM: We could be by
the Allowak's Sanctuary.

02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:21.363
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:26:21.387 --> 02:26:22.528
LIAM: Oh, wow.

02:26:22.552 --> 02:26:25.447
SAM: Is that where the yetis
are? LIAM: That's a steep
southwest, yeah.

02:26:25.471 --> 02:26:27.528
SAM: Should we get them
to-- should we ride them?

02:26:27.552 --> 02:26:29.321
LIAM: No.
TALIESIN: Should we--

02:26:29.345 --> 02:26:30.113
SAM: Could we ride on yetis?

02:26:30.137 --> 02:26:31.528
TRAVIS: We need to be
doing that flying shit.

02:26:31.552 --> 02:26:33.612
TALIESIN: We should we need
to be doing that flying shit.

02:26:33.636 --> 02:26:34.571
MARISHA: How many days were we--

02:26:34.595 --> 02:26:36.528
we were still in
under a week, right?

02:26:36.552 --> 02:26:38.528
We're on day five or
something like that?

02:26:38.552 --> 02:26:39.738
MATT: Roughly
around there, yeah.

02:26:39.762 --> 02:26:41.280
TALIESIN: But better faster

02:26:41.304 --> 02:26:43.488
than shorter.
MARISHA: For sure.

02:26:43.512 --> 02:26:44.863
TRAVIS: Time to grind.
LAURA: We should fly.

02:26:44.887 --> 02:26:46.654
LIAM: Yeah, shoot.

02:26:46.678 --> 02:26:49.636
TALIESIN: How far away are we
from the mountains right now?

02:26:51.095 --> 02:26:52.137
MATT: You're probably...

02:26:55.095 --> 02:26:56.571
10 or so miles away, maybe.

02:26:56.595 --> 02:26:57.696
TALIESIN: So I say we--

02:26:57.720 --> 02:26:59.528
This is my plan, if
anyone's interested.

02:26:59.552 --> 02:27:00.612
We could get to the mountains

02:27:00.636 --> 02:27:02.528
and then fly through
the mountains.

02:27:02.552 --> 02:27:04.447
We just walk to the mountains.

02:27:04.471 --> 02:27:07.528
That's half an hour, ish, 45--

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:09.528
there's snow, this is slow.

02:27:09.552 --> 02:27:13.528
But then we can try and fly
maybe through the mountains.

02:27:13.552 --> 02:27:15.988
LAURA: Why don't we just
fly <i>to</i> the mountains

02:27:16.012 --> 02:27:17.321
and <i>through</i>
the mountains?

02:27:17.345 --> 02:27:18.821
TALIESIN: Well, how
long can we fly for?

02:27:18.845 --> 02:27:21.071
MATT: You would, actually,
with your perception check,

02:27:21.095 --> 02:27:22.821
you do not see-- I
should've clarified.

02:27:22.845 --> 02:27:25.071
You do not see the river
of lava between you guys

02:27:25.095 --> 02:27:27.528
and the mountain
range to the east.

02:27:27.552 --> 02:27:28.488
As you've had this conversation,

02:27:28.512 --> 02:27:31.363
you look and you can
see it to your west.

02:27:31.387 --> 02:27:33.029
TALIESIN: So we are on
the other side of it.

02:27:33.053 --> 02:27:35.488
MATT: You <i>are</i> on the
eastern side of it.

02:27:35.512 --> 02:27:36.528
LAURA: That's good.

02:27:36.552 --> 02:27:37.696
We can fly for an hour.

02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:40.280
TALIESIN: So I would say we
wait till we're at the base.

02:27:40.304 --> 02:27:41.738
That way we get as far
through the mountains

02:27:41.762 --> 02:27:43.095
as possible.
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:27:44.552 --> 02:27:46.528
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: We're southwest of the--

02:27:46.552 --> 02:27:49.196
am I forgetting
where the Outpost is?

02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:51.155
I thought it was where
Aeor is on the map, right?

02:27:51.179 --> 02:27:54.529
TRAVIS: If Aeor's right
there then we're right here.

02:27:54.553 --> 02:27:56.988
On the eastern
side of the river.

02:27:57.012 --> 02:27:58.779
LIAM: So not by Allowak's.

02:27:58.803 --> 02:28:00.528
TRAVIS: No.
MATT: You didn't move that far.

02:28:00.552 --> 02:28:02.405
TRAVIS: Huh? MATT: You did
not move that far away.

02:28:02.429 --> 02:28:05.238
Knowing the distance
you have there

02:28:05.262 --> 02:28:07.029
the location of the topography
as you figure it out,

02:28:07.053 --> 02:28:09.113
you can kind of triangulate.

02:28:09.137 --> 02:28:11.528
LAURA: So if we flew up
and over the mountains,

02:28:11.552 --> 02:28:13.280
that would cut down
the time by a lot.

02:28:13.304 --> 02:28:14.863
LIAM: That's three days' travel?

02:28:14.887 --> 02:28:16.447
MATT: It would cut down,
but you can only fly

02:28:16.471 --> 02:28:18.363
for an hour at a time.
LAURA: Right.

02:28:18.387 --> 02:28:20.196
MATT: So it does help.

02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:22.528
LIAM: It'll help, but it's
not going to erase it or--

02:28:22.552 --> 02:28:24.720
MATT: Yeah, depending how
many slots you burn doing it,

02:28:25.803 --> 02:28:29.029
you know, it'll maybe cut
off a day, day and a half

02:28:29.053 --> 02:28:31.738
depending on how you do it, so.

02:28:31.762 --> 02:28:32.904
TRAVIS: We'll take it.

02:28:32.928 --> 02:28:34.528
TALIESIN: I'd say once we
hit the mountains and see

02:28:34.552 --> 02:28:36.528
if we can carve
straight through them

02:28:36.552 --> 02:28:37.529
as opposed to walking around.

02:28:37.553 --> 02:28:38.696
TRAVIS: Plus when you
were talking to Lucien,

02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:41.654
didn't you say he had
to double his efforts?

02:28:41.678 --> 02:28:43.612
MARISHA: Yeah,
but it seemed like

02:28:43.636 --> 02:28:45.528
maybe they found what
they were looking for

02:28:45.552 --> 02:28:48.488
and were making their way.

02:28:48.512 --> 02:28:49.447
ALL: ♪ Making their way. ♪
TRAVIS: Quickly?

02:28:49.471 --> 02:28:50.238
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:28:50.262 --> 02:28:51.904
TALIESIN: He strikes me as
the sort of person to tell

02:28:51.928 --> 02:28:53.488
the truth in a way of--
TRAVIS: Let's fly!

02:28:53.512 --> 02:28:54.529
TALIESIN: -- that you can't
tell. LAURA: Okay, well, I can
fly--

02:28:54.553 --> 02:28:55.779
MARISHA: 100%.

02:28:55.803 --> 02:28:57.363
LAURA: We got to
figure this out again.

02:28:57.387 --> 02:28:58.636
Because I can only fly--

02:28:59.552 --> 02:29:01.779
turn two people into
animals for an hour

02:29:01.803 --> 02:29:05.405
and then from then on,
it's only me and Caleb

02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:07.678
that can turn into
flying creatures.

02:29:09.387 --> 02:29:11.779
TRAVIS: I can fly
as well for an hour.

02:29:11.803 --> 02:29:12.571
LAURA: Oh, yeah?

02:29:12.595 --> 02:29:14.528
SAM: Yasha can fly.

02:29:14.552 --> 02:29:16.363
LAURA: Only for like--
ASHLEY: I can fly for--

02:29:16.387 --> 02:29:17.155
SAM: Ten minutes?
ASHLEY: -- a minute.

02:29:17.179 --> 02:29:18.363
SAM: Oh, one minute.
ASHLEY: One minute.

02:29:18.387 --> 02:29:19.528
SAM: Okay.

02:29:19.552 --> 02:29:22.196
LAURA: So not as long as
an hour. ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:24.696
TRAVIS: Nope, I can only
fly for 10 minutes, I lied.

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:28.988
TALIESIN: So I'd say that
the biggest people, maybe?

02:29:29.012 --> 02:29:31.696
LAURA: Can we Polymorph
into a white dragon?

02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:33.488
(laughter)

02:29:33.512 --> 02:29:34.528
LAURA: Probably not, huh?

02:29:34.552 --> 02:29:37.280
You can only Polymorph up to
a certain challenge rating?

02:29:37.304 --> 02:29:39.304
MATT: Up to a certain
challenge rating, yep.

02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:43.071
TRAVIS: Should we just
mimic what we did before?

02:29:43.095 --> 02:29:43.863
SAM: Yeah.

02:29:43.887 --> 02:29:44.904
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

02:29:44.928 --> 02:29:45.696
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
LAURA: Okay.

02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:46.988
LIAM: Even if we
only do it once,

02:29:47.012 --> 02:29:48.528
it is still better than nothing.

02:29:48.552 --> 02:29:49.429
LAURA: Yeah.

02:29:54.595 --> 02:29:55.571
TRAVIS: What did we do before?

02:29:55.595 --> 02:29:57.528
ASHLEY: I think I was a--

02:29:57.552 --> 02:29:58.904
LIAM: Well, eagles is faster.

02:29:58.928 --> 02:30:00.113
LAURA: Eagles are faster, yeah.

02:30:00.137 --> 02:30:02.528
MATT: Yeah, it can
be any beast is the--

02:30:02.552 --> 02:30:04.552
LAURA: Any beast, got it, okay.

02:30:06.471 --> 02:30:07.528
TRAVIS: Who are the eagles?

02:30:07.552 --> 02:30:10.528
LIAM: Well, Yasha, I think
makes sense to be an eagle.

02:30:10.552 --> 02:30:11.696
TRAVIS: And Caleb and Jester?

02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:13.528
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay, so.

02:30:13.552 --> 02:30:14.946
LAURA: Once we get to the
base of the mountains,

02:30:14.970 --> 02:30:16.488
we'll do that and
then we'll fly.

02:30:16.512 --> 02:30:19.654
MARISHA: And then we split
up Caduceus on one person,

02:30:19.678 --> 02:30:21.528
Veth paired with somebody.

02:30:21.552 --> 02:30:22.387
LAURA: Yeah.

02:30:23.262 --> 02:30:24.405
MARISHA: So.

02:30:24.429 --> 02:30:26.196
MATT: Okay, so you're
going to travel on foot

02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:27.528
to the mountain range
and then transform,

02:30:27.552 --> 02:30:28.988
or transforming now?

02:30:29.012 --> 02:30:30.071
LAURA: On foot to
the mountain range.

02:30:30.095 --> 02:30:30.863
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.

02:30:30.887 --> 02:30:31.863
LAURA: And then transform
at the mountains.

02:30:31.887 --> 02:30:33.280
MATT: Okay, got it.

02:30:33.304 --> 02:30:35.821
Well, I need somebody to go
ahead and roll a d20 for me.

02:30:35.845 --> 02:30:36.612
SAM: Whose turn was it?

02:30:36.636 --> 02:30:38.863
LIAM: Why don't we start
fresh with Fjord-y?

02:30:38.887 --> 02:30:40.363
TALIESIN: Boulder,
paper, shears?

02:30:40.387 --> 02:30:41.571
ASHLEY: I'm not doing it again.
SAM: Boulder, parchment, shears.

02:30:41.595 --> 02:30:44.029
MARISHA: Yeah, we
might've left off at you.

02:30:44.053 --> 02:30:45.155
ASHLEY: We might have.

02:30:45.179 --> 02:30:45.988
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Wait,

02:30:46.012 --> 02:30:48.528
I think we should all play
boulder, parchment, shears.

02:30:48.552 --> 02:30:49.821
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:30:49.845 --> 02:30:52.528
MARISHA: Oh, like
eliminate together.

02:30:52.552 --> 02:30:54.738
SAM: This is going to work.
ASHLEY: It's fine. We'll make it
work.

02:30:54.762 --> 02:30:56.488
MATT: On three.
SAM: Ready?

02:30:56.512 --> 02:30:57.552
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

02:30:59.845 --> 02:31:00.612
MARISHA: Okay.

02:31:00.636 --> 02:31:02.113
ASHLEY: This is
not going to work.

02:31:02.137 --> 02:31:03.654
TALIESIN: There's
only one scissor!

02:31:03.678 --> 02:31:05.779
There's only one shears.

02:31:05.803 --> 02:31:06.946
LAURA: So he wins,
okay, you roll.

02:31:06.970 --> 02:31:08.363
MARISHA: You win!

02:31:08.387 --> 02:31:09.238
LIAM: That's how it works.
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:31:09.262 --> 02:31:10.029
MARISHA: Shears
beats all. (laughs)

02:31:10.053 --> 02:31:10.988
TALIESIN: Shears beats all.

02:31:11.012 --> 02:31:11.803
MATT: Checks out.

02:31:12.762 --> 02:31:15.280
(laughter)

02:31:15.304 --> 02:31:18.471
LIAM: Okay, I'll roll the
meteorite die to crush us.

02:31:19.345 --> 02:31:20.113
Where'd you hide?

02:31:20.137 --> 02:31:21.113
A three.

02:31:21.137 --> 02:31:23.071
MATT: A three.

02:31:23.095 --> 02:31:23.904
LAURA: Oh no.

02:31:23.928 --> 02:31:24.696
MATT: Okay.

02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:26.196
LIAM: Oh yes, oh no.

02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:29.155
LAURA: Remember the
eight is the dragon.

02:31:29.179 --> 02:31:30.595
ASHLEY: Eight was dragon?
LIAM: Dang it.

02:31:34.304 --> 02:31:38.612
MATT: What was once a
somewhat gray, broken blue sky

02:31:38.636 --> 02:31:40.612
begins to grow
darker with clouds.

02:31:40.636 --> 02:31:41.654
MARISHA: No!

02:31:41.678 --> 02:31:46.678
MATT: And the weather begins
to grow harsher and harsher.

02:31:47.053 --> 02:31:50.280
You bundle yourselves. Becoming
accustomed to less colder

02:31:50.304 --> 02:31:52.738
areas, and the return to
Eiselcross has been jarring.

02:31:52.762 --> 02:31:55.113
So as you bundle up
and trudge through

02:31:55.137 --> 02:31:58.528
the ever-growing pressure
of the snow and wind,

02:31:58.552 --> 02:32:01.220
eventually you do make it
to the base of the mountain.

02:32:02.053 --> 02:32:04.595
Flight is going to be a little
hard, but it can be done.

02:32:05.970 --> 02:32:07.528
LAURA: Fuck.

02:32:07.552 --> 02:32:09.363
TALIESIN: To fly or not to fly?

02:32:09.387 --> 02:32:11.238
LAURA: We have to,
we have no other way

02:32:11.262 --> 02:32:13.528
to get up and over these
mountains. Otherwise we have to
go

02:32:13.552 --> 02:32:14.696
around them now.
TRAVIS: What's the flying speed?

02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:15.988
LAURA and LIAM: 80 feet.

02:32:16.012 --> 02:32:18.238
TRAVIS: So if it's
halved it's 40?

02:32:18.262 --> 02:32:19.029
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.

02:32:19.053 --> 02:32:20.654
TRAVIS: Because of the
wind, and most of our speeds

02:32:20.678 --> 02:32:22.405
are 30 to 40 on foot.

02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:25.528
LIAM: Well, you have to go as
fast as your slowest person.

02:32:25.552 --> 02:32:26.528
TRAVIS: That's true.

02:32:26.552 --> 02:32:29.779
TALIESIN: Was the wind
coming from the mountains

02:32:29.803 --> 02:32:30.970
or towards the mountains?

02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:35.552
MATT: Make a nature check,
or survival, your choice.

02:32:39.552 --> 02:32:40.696
TALIESIN: 13.

02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:43.988
MATT: 13, it is heading
towards the mountains

02:32:44.012 --> 02:32:47.612
and in a-- it's
somewhat helpful,

02:32:47.636 --> 02:32:50.488
though it's going more
eastern than northeast.

02:32:50.512 --> 02:32:51.821
So it might--

02:32:51.845 --> 02:32:52.612
TALIESIN: It'll jostle us,

02:32:52.636 --> 02:32:53.946
but we're not going
to be fighting it.

02:32:53.970 --> 02:32:54.863
MATT: Exactly.

02:32:54.887 --> 02:32:56.863
LAURA: Okay. TALIESIN: So
it won't halve our speed,

02:32:56.887 --> 02:32:59.488
but we will have to
be really careful.

02:32:59.512 --> 02:33:01.779
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:33:01.803 --> 02:33:03.571
LAURA: So I'll
Polymorph me and Yasha

02:33:03.595 --> 02:33:05.113
LIAM: I'll take care of myself.

02:33:05.137 --> 02:33:06.113
LAURA: Okay.

02:33:06.137 --> 02:33:07.113
MATT: Okay.

02:33:07.137 --> 02:33:08.528
TALIESIN: I'm going
to use a little rope

02:33:08.552 --> 02:33:09.738
just to make something extra

02:33:09.762 --> 02:33:12.029
to hang on to, if that's okay.

02:33:12.053 --> 02:33:15.071
Since it's windy.
LAURA: That makes sense.

02:33:15.095 --> 02:33:15.988
TALIESIN: Bit of a bridle.

02:33:16.012 --> 02:33:16.779
LIAM: Okay.

02:33:16.803 --> 02:33:19.238
LAURA: We should make you with--

02:33:19.262 --> 02:33:20.779
LIAM: Caduceus with-- well.

02:33:20.803 --> 02:33:21.821
LAURA: Caduceus with Yasha.

02:33:21.845 --> 02:33:23.071
LIAM: Because of
the strength, <i>ja</i>?

02:33:23.095 --> 02:33:23.863
MARISHA: Because
the strength, yeah.

02:33:23.887 --> 02:33:27.738
MATT: Just keeping
this situated here.

02:33:27.762 --> 02:33:30.155
So who is riding on--
we'll say this is Caduceus.

02:33:30.179 --> 02:33:31.113
LIAM: Jester, why
don't you take Fjord.

02:33:31.137 --> 02:33:32.196
MATT: Or Yasha, sorry.

02:33:32.220 --> 02:33:34.155
LAURA: And you take Beau and
Veth. LIAM: Those two together--

02:33:34.179 --> 02:33:34.946
Yeah, yeah, that make sense.

02:33:34.970 --> 02:33:36.571
equals the weight of one
of the other party members.

02:33:36.595 --> 02:33:37.528
MARISHA: That's true.

02:33:37.552 --> 02:33:38.528
MATT: Who are you taking?

02:33:38.552 --> 02:33:39.528
LAURA: Fjord.

02:33:39.552 --> 02:33:40.779
MATT: Fjord, all righty.

02:33:40.803 --> 02:33:42.528
TALIESIN: And then
where are you, Beau?

02:33:42.552 --> 02:33:44.238
MARISHA: I'm riding
on Caleb with Veth.

02:33:44.262 --> 02:33:45.904
TALIESIN: Gotcha.
MATT: Got it.

02:33:45.928 --> 02:33:48.071
TALIESIN: And then
you're on, okay.

02:33:48.095 --> 02:33:49.904
MATT: Okay. TALIESIN:
We're splitting up the--

02:33:49.928 --> 02:33:51.571
LAURA: The clerics.
That's-- yeah.

02:33:51.595 --> 02:33:53.238
LIAM: Eee!

02:33:53.262 --> 02:33:56.762
MATT: So whoever the flyers are,

02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:00.529
if I can have you go
ahead and roll either

02:34:00.553 --> 02:34:02.571
an athletics or acrobatics check

02:34:02.595 --> 02:34:04.528
for whatever form you're taking.

02:34:04.552 --> 02:34:08.155
TRAVIS: You are flyer, not a
faller. TALIESIN: Guidance.

02:34:08.179 --> 02:34:09.113
MARISHA: I put on my goggles

02:34:09.137 --> 02:34:10.779
by the way.
LIAM: Athletics or which?

02:34:10.803 --> 02:34:13.528
MATT: Acrobatics, which would
be either a strength bonus

02:34:13.552 --> 02:34:15.071
or a dex bonus,
that's your choice

02:34:15.095 --> 02:34:16.029
based on the form you took.

02:34:16.053 --> 02:34:19.803
LIAM: They're the same,
so I'm going strength.

02:34:21.512 --> 02:34:22.363
Terrible.
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

02:34:22.387 --> 02:34:23.552
TALIESIN: Strength or dex.

02:34:25.595 --> 02:34:26.904
LAURA: 22.

02:34:26.928 --> 02:34:28.528
LIAM: Eight.

02:34:28.552 --> 02:34:29.528
ASHLEY: 31.

02:34:29.552 --> 02:34:30.821
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Wait.

02:34:30.845 --> 02:34:33.071
This is giant eagle stuff?

02:34:33.095 --> 02:34:33.863
MATT: Yeah.

02:34:33.887 --> 02:34:35.405
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: So do I not use my--?

02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:37.113
MATT: No, you use the
form of the eagle.

02:34:37.137 --> 02:34:37.904
LIAM: Plus three only.

02:34:37.928 --> 02:34:38.904
TALIESIN: Okay, oh,
plus three only?

02:34:38.928 --> 02:34:39.845
Okay, so.

02:34:40.762 --> 02:34:42.262
LAURA: Right, right, 21.

02:34:44.552 --> 02:34:45.571
ASHLEY: 25.

02:34:45.595 --> 02:34:47.405
MATT: Which is still
two very high rolls

02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:49.612
versus one lower,
which between this

02:34:49.636 --> 02:34:52.528
minute skill challenge
puts you in the positive.

02:34:52.552 --> 02:34:55.612
So you do begin to trudge
through the heavy wind

02:34:55.636 --> 02:34:58.196
and the snow, and as
you begin to pick up,

02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:01.528
the challenge comes in not
being pushed into the side

02:35:01.552 --> 02:35:04.363
of the mountain as the wind
is taking you that way.

02:35:04.387 --> 02:35:06.988
You begin to adjust
and use the blasts

02:35:07.012 --> 02:35:09.155
and the gusts to your
favor, having it carry you

02:35:09.179 --> 02:35:11.529
higher and quicker,
higher and quicker,

02:35:11.553 --> 02:35:13.779
until eventually you begin
to coast over some of the

02:35:13.803 --> 02:35:17.071
highest parts of this edge
of the mountain range.

02:35:17.095 --> 02:35:22.071
What you can see through the
casting of snow and white

02:35:22.095 --> 02:35:27.095
are all the peaks of gray
rock and ice beneath.

02:35:27.262 --> 02:35:30.528
You continue on for quite a
bit until you begin to feel

02:35:30.552 --> 02:35:33.512
the spell begin to
reach its conclusion.

02:35:34.512 --> 02:35:36.321
LAURA: Looking for a
safe place to land.

02:35:36.345 --> 02:35:38.196
Looking for a safe
place to land.

02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:40.528
MATT: I need the three of
you, anybody on your back

02:35:40.552 --> 02:35:42.904
who would like to make
a perception check

02:35:42.928 --> 02:35:45.071
using your creature's form.

02:35:45.095 --> 02:35:47.488
So roll and add your
wisdom, though I believe

02:35:47.512 --> 02:35:49.528
if it's large eagle, right?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:35:49.552 --> 02:35:51.528
MATT: Then those have a
perception advantage, right?

02:35:51.552 --> 02:35:53.196
For sight?
LIAM: With sight.

02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:55.528
MATT: Correct, so
go ahead and make--

02:35:55.552 --> 02:35:58.528
though it's just a single roll

02:35:58.552 --> 02:35:59.571
because it would be
with disadvantage

02:35:59.595 --> 02:36:00.528
because of the storm.

02:36:00.552 --> 02:36:01.528
LAURA: Okay, so I take
the first roll, then.

02:36:01.552 --> 02:36:03.528
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:36:03.552 --> 02:36:04.863
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:36:04.887 --> 02:36:05.946
ASHLEY: What are we
adding to it again?

02:36:05.970 --> 02:36:07.528
MATT: Whatever your wisdom is.
LAURA: Four.

02:36:07.552 --> 02:36:09.946
Your perception is a plus four.
MARISHA: Is that the same die?

02:36:09.970 --> 02:36:11.238
LIAM: This shit is legit.
LAURA: So 15 for me.

02:36:11.262 --> 02:36:12.029
MARISHA: Damn.

02:36:12.053 --> 02:36:13.363
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Damn!

02:36:13.387 --> 02:36:14.196
SAM: Broken. Burn it.
LIAM: Shut up!

02:36:14.220 --> 02:36:15.363
SAM: Burn it, it's a witch.
ASHLEY: 19.

02:36:15.387 --> 02:36:16.363
LIAM: Go to hell.

02:36:16.387 --> 02:36:17.179
MATT: Okay.

02:36:18.636 --> 02:36:22.447
Peering through the storm,
looking into the forms below,

02:36:22.471 --> 02:36:27.528
you can just barely make out
a shelf of ice-covered stone

02:36:27.552 --> 02:36:30.488
that's the closest safe
spot to stop nearby

02:36:30.512 --> 02:36:33.321
and it's on the opposite
side of a mountain peak

02:36:33.345 --> 02:36:36.280
to where it may block the
wind from blowing you.

02:36:36.304 --> 02:36:39.405
So you head your
way down toward it

02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:43.488
and then land in the soft
snow trying to find footing.

02:36:43.512 --> 02:36:44.528
It does slip a bit.

02:36:44.552 --> 02:36:47.528
The ice beneath is really
hard to get a hold on,

02:36:47.552 --> 02:36:49.738
but the wind is cut
off at this angle

02:36:49.762 --> 02:36:51.803
and you find a
safe spot to stop.

02:36:54.553 --> 02:36:55.552
MARISHA: Good work.

02:36:57.387 --> 02:36:58.155
LAURA: Hi.

02:36:58.179 --> 02:36:59.528
MARISHA: Not bad.

02:36:59.552 --> 02:37:03.528
TALIESIN: Yeah, we may be
stuck here for a little while,

02:37:03.552 --> 02:37:08.071
but at least everybody
else will be stuck too, so.

02:37:08.095 --> 02:37:10.696
LAURA: Did anybody see the Tomb
Takers while we were flying?

02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:11.571
Did anybody see them?

02:37:11.595 --> 02:37:12.988
SAM: Oh, I wasn't
looking for them.

02:37:13.012 --> 02:37:14.488
MARISHA: Oh, I didn't.
TALIESIN: I wasn't looking.

02:37:14.512 --> 02:37:15.528
MARISHA: That would've been
a good idea. LAURA: Okay.

02:37:15.552 --> 02:37:16.528
SAM: Shoot, sorry.

02:37:16.552 --> 02:37:17.528
LAURA: No, no, no it's fine.

02:37:17.552 --> 02:37:19.113
I would've looked, but
it was really windy

02:37:19.137 --> 02:37:20.528
and it was, like,
burning my eyeballs

02:37:20.552 --> 02:37:23.053
SAM: Yeah, there were some
weird storms whipping around.

02:37:24.345 --> 02:37:25.738
LAURA: Next time we fly,
we should look for them.

02:37:25.762 --> 02:37:26.612
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:37:26.636 --> 02:37:29.528
LIAM: So are we going
for another round

02:37:29.552 --> 02:37:32.029
or are we calling it a day?

02:37:32.053 --> 02:37:33.280
LAURA: We need to go
for another round.

02:37:33.304 --> 02:37:34.071
LIAM: Okay.

02:37:34.095 --> 02:37:35.946
TALIESIN: Do we
need a short rest?

02:37:35.970 --> 02:37:36.779
Does a short rest help?

02:37:36.803 --> 02:37:37.821
LAURA: No.
LIAM: No, I'm just

02:37:37.845 --> 02:37:39.029
doing this for flavor.

02:37:39.053 --> 02:37:40.528
(laughter)

02:37:40.552 --> 02:37:41.512
TALIESIN: Fair.

02:37:43.595 --> 02:37:45.363
LAURA: Okay, but it's
only going to be me

02:37:45.387 --> 02:37:47.528
and Caleb flying now.

02:37:47.552 --> 02:37:49.363
SAM: We can still do it, right?

02:37:49.387 --> 02:37:52.179
LAURA: Yeah, but we'll move
a little bit slower, I think.

02:37:53.387 --> 02:37:55.280
MARISHA: Are we
through the mountains?

02:37:55.304 --> 02:37:56.321
Did we make it
through the mountains?

02:37:56.345 --> 02:37:57.488
MATT: No, you're in the middle
of the mountains right now.

02:37:57.512 --> 02:37:58.280
MARISHA: In the middle

02:37:58.304 --> 02:37:59.155
of the mountains.
LAURA: So it'll be harder,

02:37:59.179 --> 02:38:00.863
but we can do it.

02:38:00.887 --> 02:38:05.887
LIAM: Yeah, so you carry
Caduceus and I will carry Yasha.

02:38:06.552 --> 02:38:07.762
and then what is left is

02:38:09.636 --> 02:38:12.528
Fjord again with you,
and you two with me,

02:38:12.552 --> 02:38:14.528
and that is about even.

02:38:14.552 --> 02:38:18.447
MARISHA: Does it look pretty
rocky and rough ahead of us

02:38:18.471 --> 02:38:19.738
through these mountains?

02:38:19.762 --> 02:38:20.571
MATT: Yeah, the mountains

02:38:20.595 --> 02:38:21.863
are pretty nasty.
LAURA: Yeah, I'll take Yasha,

02:38:21.887 --> 02:38:22.654
you take Caduceus.

02:38:22.678 --> 02:38:24.528
LIAM: Okay, okay.
LAURA: Just in casies.

02:38:24.552 --> 02:38:26.071
LIAM: Okay.

02:38:26.095 --> 02:38:28.363
MATT: It looks like a lot
of the mountains here--

02:38:28.387 --> 02:38:30.321
there are some softer edges,

02:38:30.345 --> 02:38:32.528
but a lot of them are
these pointed peaks

02:38:32.552 --> 02:38:34.528
where ice has built up over time

02:38:34.552 --> 02:38:38.571
and has caused these
spire-like points.

02:38:38.595 --> 02:38:40.280
It leads to some
interesting valleys,

02:38:40.304 --> 02:38:42.571
which can be be taken
for a shelter if need be

02:38:42.595 --> 02:38:44.029
in a crutch moment,

02:38:44.053 --> 02:38:46.471
but you would not
want to fall upon

02:38:47.552 --> 02:38:49.821
some of these mountains spires.

02:38:49.845 --> 02:38:52.029
So you're both transforming?

02:38:52.053 --> 02:38:53.528
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:38:53.552 --> 02:38:55.928
LAURA: Let me see.
Wait, hold on.

02:38:56.845 --> 02:38:57.803
I can't remember.

02:39:00.053 --> 02:39:01.821
Polymorph is concentration.

02:39:01.845 --> 02:39:03.447
MATT: Yes, it is.

02:39:03.471 --> 02:39:06.363
LAURA: You're guiding somebody.
You're going to guide him.

02:39:06.387 --> 02:39:07.179
Okay.

02:39:08.928 --> 02:39:10.738
ASHLEY: I'm on Jester.
MATT: Okay.

02:39:10.762 --> 02:39:12.552
ASHLEY: And Caduceus is on the--

02:39:14.762 --> 02:39:16.528
Caleb.

02:39:16.552 --> 02:39:18.863
LAURA: I'm carrying
Yasha and Fjord.

02:39:18.887 --> 02:39:21.196
LIAM: And Caduceus,
I'm going to carry you,

02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:23.280
and ladies, please,

02:39:23.304 --> 02:39:25.053
I think you should ride on top.

02:39:27.262 --> 02:39:30.863
LAURA: Which one of you wants
to ride like this in my claws

02:39:30.887 --> 02:39:33.552
and which one of you
wants to ride on my wings?

02:39:34.595 --> 02:39:35.863
ASHLEY: I'll take claws.

02:39:35.887 --> 02:39:37.238
TRAVIS: All right.

02:39:37.262 --> 02:39:39.612
LAURA: I can carry you
like you're on a chair.

02:39:39.636 --> 02:39:42.528
I can carry you by your arms.

02:39:42.552 --> 02:39:44.321
I can carry you like, you know,

02:39:44.345 --> 02:39:47.612
like you're flying
sideways like this.

02:39:47.636 --> 02:39:49.488
What seems most comfortable?

02:39:49.512 --> 02:39:50.946
ASHLEY: Maybe like a chair.

02:39:50.970 --> 02:39:51.738
LAURA: Okay, I'll do this.

02:39:51.762 --> 02:39:53.155
ASHLEY: Yeah, like a
little thing and then I'll

02:39:53.179 --> 02:39:54.321
swing my legs.
LIAM: Ski lift?

02:39:54.345 --> 02:39:55.113
ASHLEY: Yeah, like a ski lift.

02:39:55.137 --> 02:39:56.528
TRAVIS: She can fly by herself.

02:39:56.552 --> 02:39:57.696
LAURA: For, like, a minute.

02:39:57.720 --> 02:39:58.528
TRAVIS: No, I know.

02:39:58.552 --> 02:40:00.321
ASHLEY: Yeah, but if there's
an emergency, you know, I can.

02:40:00.345 --> 02:40:02.528
LAURA: Yeah, if I start to
fall, bamf your wings out

02:40:02.552 --> 02:40:03.821
and you know, don't die.

02:40:03.845 --> 02:40:05.528
ASHLEY: So I feel like
you might be safer to--

02:40:05.552 --> 02:40:07.029
Well, you can also--

02:40:07.053 --> 02:40:09.113
TRAVIS: Fly.
ASHLEY: Okay, we're fine.

02:40:09.137 --> 02:40:10.571
LAURA: Okay.

02:40:10.595 --> 02:40:12.280
MATT: All right.

02:40:12.304 --> 02:40:13.528
So this is the arrangement
we're going with?

02:40:13.552 --> 02:40:14.363
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:40:14.387 --> 02:40:15.179
MATT: You got it.

02:40:16.304 --> 02:40:17.821
Picking back up once more,

02:40:17.845 --> 02:40:19.863
(wings flapping)

02:40:19.887 --> 02:40:22.528
and you crest the moment
where wind hits you

02:40:22.552 --> 02:40:24.528
and you have to take
a moment to adjust.

02:40:24.552 --> 02:40:25.528
I'd like to have the two eagles

02:40:25.552 --> 02:40:26.571
once again roll for me, please.

02:40:26.595 --> 02:40:27.528
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

02:40:27.552 --> 02:40:28.863
MATT: Athletics or
acrobatics, your choice.

02:40:28.887 --> 02:40:30.528
TRAVIS: Add a d4!

02:40:30.552 --> 02:40:31.552
MATT: Strength or dex.

02:40:32.887 --> 02:40:33.821
LIAM: 19, I rolled.

02:40:33.845 --> 02:40:35.280
TALIESIN: Did you add the d4?

02:40:35.304 --> 02:40:36.071
LIAM: Do I get a d4?

02:40:36.095 --> 02:40:37.654
TALIESIN: You get a d4.
LIAM: I do, too?

02:40:37.678 --> 02:40:39.447
LAURA: I rolled 15.
LIAM: Oh boy!

02:40:39.471 --> 02:40:42.821
MATT: 15. Okay. You both
manage to maintain your course

02:40:42.845 --> 02:40:46.528
in the face of this
strong, strong storm.

02:40:46.552 --> 02:40:49.821
It's blowing you further east
if you can keep going forward

02:40:49.845 --> 02:40:52.779
that might be to your
advantage. Might be.

02:40:52.803 --> 02:40:55.571
MARISHA: Does this
storm sound Italian?

02:40:55.595 --> 02:40:57.863
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:40:57.887 --> 02:40:59.345
LIAM: It's-a me!

02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:03.155
MARISHA: Natural
two, so you know.

02:41:03.179 --> 02:41:05.552
MATT: It sounds a little
more, I want to say Austrian.

02:41:06.803 --> 02:41:07.696
MARISHA: Sound of Music.

02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:09.571
MATT and TRAVIS: (garbled Arnold
Schwarzenegger impressions)

02:41:09.595 --> 02:41:11.345
LIAM: You are von Trapp-ed!

02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:13.696
SAM: I'm blowing, I'm blowing.

02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:16.113
TRAVIS: I hate all of
these white things.

02:41:16.137 --> 02:41:20.071
MATT: It's a voice over disease,
doing an Arnold impression.

02:41:20.095 --> 02:41:21.654
ASHLEY: Get to the Outpost.

02:41:21.678 --> 02:41:22.904
(laughter)

02:41:22.928 --> 02:41:24.528
SAM: I am the Herr Carl Rogen.

02:41:24.552 --> 02:41:26.528
MATT: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: He's not a Tomb Taker.

02:41:26.552 --> 02:41:27.654
(laughter)

02:41:27.678 --> 02:41:29.552
LIAM: Oh no!

02:41:30.552 --> 02:41:31.946
SAM: Not at all.
MARISHA: That was pretty good.

02:41:31.970 --> 02:41:34.155
LIAM: Oh no!

02:41:34.179 --> 02:41:35.863
ASHLEY: Get to the eagles.

02:41:35.887 --> 02:41:38.528
(laughter)

02:41:38.552 --> 02:41:40.654
MATT: You motherfucker.

02:41:40.678 --> 02:41:42.238
Okay.

02:41:42.262 --> 02:41:44.552
LIAM: These are my
eagles, Whiskey and Lulu.

02:41:46.636 --> 02:41:48.528
MATT: It is tougher for
you to go at full speed

02:41:48.552 --> 02:41:50.280
carrying this number of folk.

02:41:50.304 --> 02:41:53.280
It doesn't slow you down--

02:41:53.304 --> 02:41:55.363
It doesn't slow you down
to half speed, necessarily,

02:41:55.387 --> 02:41:57.571
but you aren't quite getting
quite the full breadth

02:41:57.595 --> 02:42:01.512
of this, but you push on, you
push on through the storm.

02:42:02.762 --> 02:42:06.738
By the time the second
hour fades you find,

02:42:06.762 --> 02:42:08.528
or begin to look for,
another safe place to land.

02:42:08.552 --> 02:42:10.988
You're still above
the mountain range.

02:42:11.012 --> 02:42:12.946
LIAM: Straight roll perception?

02:42:12.970 --> 02:42:14.528
SAM: I'm going to look
around for the Tomb Takers,

02:42:14.552 --> 02:42:15.821
because we were told to look.

02:42:15.845 --> 02:42:16.696
MARISHA: Oh, that's a good idea.

02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:17.779
TRAVIS: I do the same thing.
MARISHA: I help Veth.

02:42:17.803 --> 02:42:20.280
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm going to
help look for Tomb Takers.

02:42:20.304 --> 02:42:21.946
MATT: Okay, well then go
ahead and make a single roll

02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:23.321
because it would be
disadvantage otherwise.

02:42:23.345 --> 02:42:25.321
LIAM: I rolled shitty.
SAM: 12.

02:42:25.345 --> 02:42:27.238
MATT: All right, no Tomb Takers.

02:42:27.262 --> 02:42:29.363
LIAM: Seven.
LAURA: 19.

02:42:29.387 --> 02:42:32.488
MATT: 19, you lose
sight of a safe place.

02:42:32.512 --> 02:42:34.238
It's too much snow,
it's too much wind.

02:42:34.262 --> 02:42:35.904
It's too much storm.

02:42:35.928 --> 02:42:38.970
You, however, manage to peek
over and you see there is

02:42:40.137 --> 02:42:41.821
this large mountain that,
as opposed to coming

02:42:41.845 --> 02:42:43.779
to a singular peak, comes
to two smaller peaks

02:42:43.803 --> 02:42:46.528
at different angles, and
in that little tiny valley,

02:42:46.552 --> 02:42:47.696
it looks like
there's a safe space

02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:49.196
where it's shielded
from a lot of the storm.

02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:51.654
With that, you eventually
find yourself, land there

02:42:51.678 --> 02:42:53.405
right in time for
the magic to drop,

02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:57.321
and you safely come to a moment
of rest, catch your breath,

02:42:57.345 --> 02:43:00.762
and feel safe from the
freezing elements of the snow.

02:43:04.429 --> 02:43:05.528
If you have more
spell slots to use,

02:43:05.552 --> 02:43:07.113
you can give it another shot.

02:43:07.137 --> 02:43:09.405
LAURA: I got another
one, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:10.528
We should keep going
try to get there

02:43:10.552 --> 02:43:11.863
as fast as possible, right?

02:43:11.887 --> 02:43:13.196
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, as
much as we can--

02:43:13.220 --> 02:43:14.528
LAURA: What if we
use up all our spells

02:43:14.552 --> 02:43:16.405
and then stupid
Trent shows up again

02:43:16.429 --> 02:43:17.863
and then we have no
spells to fight him again?

02:43:17.887 --> 02:43:18.654
MATT: That's never happened.

02:43:18.678 --> 02:43:20.447
LIAM: Don't worry, I have
not been thinking about that

02:43:20.471 --> 02:43:22.762
the entire time we
were in the air.

02:43:25.262 --> 02:43:27.447
MATT: All right.
SAM: They both blew up.

02:43:27.471 --> 02:43:28.612
(laughter)

02:43:28.636 --> 02:43:30.488
SAM: Oh god!
ASHLEY: No!

02:43:30.512 --> 02:43:32.238
LIAM: Fade to feathers.

02:43:32.262 --> 02:43:34.970
MATT: Magic in Aeor can
be real dangerous, man.

02:43:36.552 --> 02:43:37.528
MARISHA: Holy shit.

02:43:37.552 --> 02:43:39.762
(laughter)

02:43:41.137 --> 02:43:42.528
TRAVIS: Guess we're walking.

02:43:42.552 --> 02:43:45.528
TALIESIN: Oh boy,
guess we're falling.

02:43:45.552 --> 02:43:46.887
LIAM: Who's got climbing gear?

02:43:49.762 --> 02:43:51.262
MATT: So yeah.
TRAVIS: Pitons.

02:43:53.387 --> 02:43:54.654
Same arrangement?
LIAM and LAURA: Yeah.

02:43:54.678 --> 02:43:56.321
MATT: All right, going up
into the storm once more

02:43:56.345 --> 02:43:59.321
with these crew, go ahead
and make another roll.

02:43:59.345 --> 02:44:00.571
TALIESIN: With a d4.

02:44:00.595 --> 02:44:02.845
LIAM: Okay, 15.

02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:04.946
LAURA: 17.

02:44:04.970 --> 02:44:07.071
MATT: 17, okay, you--
LAURA: Oh, yeah, 17.

02:44:07.095 --> 02:44:09.447
LIAM: Oh <i>schei e</i>.
Thank you!

02:44:09.471 --> 02:44:11.528
LAURA: I don't get a d4.
He's giving him Guidance.

02:44:11.552 --> 02:44:12.528
LIAM: 18.
LAURA: I can't give myself that.

02:44:12.552 --> 02:44:13.863
TALIESIN: Thank
you, 18's better.

02:44:13.887 --> 02:44:14.988
MATT: Braving the
strength of the storm,

02:44:15.012 --> 02:44:17.528
you guys are keeping
it up pretty well.

02:44:17.552 --> 02:44:19.363
As exhausted as your
bodies have become

02:44:19.387 --> 02:44:21.321
even within, the strain of
the spell and the strain

02:44:21.345 --> 02:44:23.612
of pushing is weighing
on you. You might be

02:44:23.636 --> 02:44:26.071
a little sore in the morning,
but the majority of this

02:44:26.095 --> 02:44:28.654
creature's body that
you're currently inhabiting

02:44:28.678 --> 02:44:33.612
that you've magically crafted
is managing to keep itself

02:44:33.636 --> 02:44:35.821
pretty solid on the path
you're trying to go.

02:44:35.845 --> 02:44:36.946
LAURA: My eagle looks like

02:44:36.970 --> 02:44:39.196
it's got some really
toned shoulders.

02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:40.196
MATT: There you go.

02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:41.196
You're doing a lot of P90X,

02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:43.113
like pterodactyls backing
out of trouble, yeah.

02:44:43.137 --> 02:44:45.678
LIAM: Oh, no, flashbacks.
MARISHA: Wow.

02:44:47.636 --> 02:44:49.447
TRAVIS: Pause if you need to.

02:44:49.471 --> 02:44:51.636
MATT: You push on for
another hour or so

02:44:52.762 --> 02:44:54.571
and the spells begin to fade.

02:44:54.595 --> 02:44:56.528
You're not through the
mountain range entirely,

02:44:56.552 --> 02:44:58.488
but you begin to
see the edge of it.

02:44:58.512 --> 02:44:59.528
At the very edge,

02:44:59.552 --> 02:45:02.196
the storm itself is starting
to subside a little bit.

02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:04.238
It's not as strong as it
was when you first pushed

02:45:04.262 --> 02:45:05.529
into the sky,

02:45:05.553 --> 02:45:09.528
but you do not think
this spell's duration

02:45:09.552 --> 02:45:12.887
will carry you to the final
length of traversing this plain.

02:45:15.970 --> 02:45:18.029
SAM: We could ski down the rest.

02:45:18.053 --> 02:45:22.012
LIAM: Well, I mean,
I can do it again.

02:45:23.262 --> 02:45:24.488
LAURA: We've done
it three times now?

02:45:24.512 --> 02:45:25.488
LIAM: Yes.

02:45:25.512 --> 02:45:26.904
LAURA: I mean, yeah,
I could do it again.

02:45:26.928 --> 02:45:28.946
We're wasting higher
spell slots at this point.

02:45:28.970 --> 02:45:30.304
LIAM: Yes, this is correct.

02:45:31.595 --> 02:45:32.528
LAURA: We got to look for--

02:45:32.552 --> 02:45:33.696
MATT: Well, you got to land
first. LAURA: We got to land.

02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:37.196
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, oh, are you
sure? (screeching)

02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:40.321
MATT: Go ahead and roll
perception checks for me,
please.

02:45:40.345 --> 02:45:42.988
LIAM: Oh, not advantage
because it's storm.

02:45:43.012 --> 02:45:44.488
LAURA: 20.

02:45:44.512 --> 02:45:46.821
LIAM: And their bonus is--

02:45:46.845 --> 02:45:49.113
Oh, and we get the d4
on this too, right?

02:45:49.137 --> 02:45:51.113
TALIESIN: I've basically
been pumping it into you

02:45:51.137 --> 02:45:52.321
at this point, so.

02:45:52.345 --> 02:45:53.113
MATT: Pardon me.

02:45:53.137 --> 02:45:55.238
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're welcome.

02:45:55.262 --> 02:45:56.612
LIAM: Thank you, 15.

02:45:56.636 --> 02:45:58.029
TALIESIN: You got the d4.

02:45:58.053 --> 02:46:01.196
LAURA: I got a real good visual.

02:46:01.220 --> 02:46:02.029
TALIESIN: I'm hoping for it.

02:46:02.053 --> 02:46:03.528
MATT: Nobody wants to
be pumped full of d4s.

02:46:03.552 --> 02:46:04.571
That's a terrible idea.

02:46:04.595 --> 02:46:05.738
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

02:46:05.762 --> 02:46:06.529
SAM: They're real sharp.

02:46:06.553 --> 02:46:09.528
TALIESIN: They're very
sharp, they have a point.

02:46:09.552 --> 02:46:13.280
MARISHA: (groans)

02:46:13.304 --> 02:46:15.988
MATT: You do catch one safe spot

02:46:16.012 --> 02:46:17.654
similar to the first
shelf that you came upon,

02:46:17.678 --> 02:46:19.654
but it's smaller and slimmer,

02:46:19.678 --> 02:46:20.988
which means it's going
to be a little bit

02:46:21.012 --> 02:46:21.779
of a precarious landing.

02:46:21.803 --> 02:46:23.196
Thankfully, it's just
two of you trying

02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:25.405
to find the space there for
the point of the landing.

02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:29.155
If you could both make
dexterity saving throws

02:46:29.179 --> 02:46:32.238
for me using the dex
of your bird forms.

02:46:32.262 --> 02:46:33.321
LIAM: Yeah.

02:46:33.345 --> 02:46:34.528
MATT: To see if you
can stick the landing.

02:46:34.552 --> 02:46:36.612
LAURA: Bird dex.
LIAM: Natural 20!

02:46:36.636 --> 02:46:38.113
TRAVIS: Wow, that's
three in the past--

02:46:38.137 --> 02:46:40.488
MARISHA: That's pretty good.
LAURA: 21.

02:46:40.512 --> 02:46:42.488
SAM: Burn it.
MARISHA: Same die?

02:46:42.512 --> 02:46:43.528
LIAM: It's the dunamancy die.

02:46:43.552 --> 02:46:44.528
MATT: Apparently.
SAM: Destroy it.

02:46:44.552 --> 02:46:46.821
LIAM: It is, sparkly, space.

02:46:46.845 --> 02:46:48.012
MATT: It must be destroyed.

02:46:49.179 --> 02:46:50.304
Cast it into the fire!

02:46:51.803 --> 02:46:53.528
TRAVIS: What movie's that from?

02:46:53.552 --> 02:46:55.363
LIAM: Campaign one was gold.
MATT: Constantine.

02:46:55.387 --> 02:46:57.595
LIAM: Now it is physics.

02:47:00.179 --> 02:47:02.696
MATT: You both manage
to skid into it, scrape,

02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:05.512
and catch yourself to the
very edge before going over

02:47:06.552 --> 02:47:08.528
right as the spell
vanishes from beneath you

02:47:08.552 --> 02:47:12.029
and all of your friendly
payload fall into the snow

02:47:12.053 --> 02:47:13.738
and ice next to you.

02:47:13.762 --> 02:47:15.196
It is at a slight angle.

02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:16.738
There's an uncomfortable
moment where you feel yourself

02:47:16.762 --> 02:47:21.612
gives just a bit,
that slight decline

02:47:21.636 --> 02:47:24.528
makes you worried that
there's a chance to slip off

02:47:24.552 --> 02:47:27.612
and fall, but you feel
pretty comfortable

02:47:27.636 --> 02:47:28.553
where you landed.

02:47:30.179 --> 02:47:33.262
LIAM: Okay, now.

02:47:34.095 --> 02:47:36.528
MARISHA: How you guys doing?

02:47:36.552 --> 02:47:37.528
LAURA: Kind of tired.

02:47:37.552 --> 02:47:38.738
MARISHA: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Oh, us, too.

02:47:38.762 --> 02:47:39.863
I feel like we're
really grinding.

02:47:39.887 --> 02:47:42.363
LAURA: You're getting a
lot of wind in your face,

02:47:42.387 --> 02:47:43.405
I wouldn't be
surprised if you are--

02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:44.528
MARISHA: A little chapped.

02:47:44.552 --> 02:47:46.612
TRAVIS: We look down,
and in the terrible--

02:47:46.636 --> 02:47:49.528
try and see anybody
walking, making their way.

02:47:49.552 --> 02:47:50.612
TRAVIS and MATT:
♪ Making our way ♪

02:47:50.636 --> 02:47:52.196
LIAM: Down below.

02:47:52.220 --> 02:47:52.988
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)
LIAM: ♪ Down below ♪

02:47:53.012 --> 02:47:54.528
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: ♪ Six feet under ♪

02:47:54.552 --> 02:47:56.029
LIAM, MARISHA, and
LAURA: ♪ Down below ♪

02:47:56.053 --> 02:47:56.928
TRAVIS: 19.

02:47:58.095 --> 02:47:59.155
MATT: 19?

02:47:59.179 --> 02:47:59.946
LIAM: I want to see it.

02:47:59.970 --> 02:48:02.113
MATT: With disadvantage
because of the storm.

02:48:02.137 --> 02:48:03.528
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:48:03.552 --> 02:48:05.571
LIAM: Come back, theater,
come back. TRAVIS: Aww, 16.

02:48:05.595 --> 02:48:07.363
MATT: 16.

02:48:07.387 --> 02:48:11.488
Looking around, you
do not see any sign

02:48:11.512 --> 02:48:14.053
of anything beyond
snow, ice, and stone.

02:48:17.262 --> 02:48:18.552
Yeah. That's all you got.

02:48:20.762 --> 02:48:22.488
TALIESIN: I could
get a personal mount.

02:48:22.512 --> 02:48:25.071
I could burn my strongest, my--

02:48:25.095 --> 02:48:26.904
SAM: What?
TALIESIN: Yeah, you heard me.

02:48:26.928 --> 02:48:28.528
(laughter)

02:48:28.552 --> 02:48:29.363
TRAVIS: You know, I
could get a personal--

02:48:29.387 --> 02:48:32.528
TALIESIN: If you need one less
person, I could summon--
MARISHA: Taliesin, or--

02:48:32.552 --> 02:48:33.528
TALIESIN: -- flying creature.
LAURA: No, that's not it.

02:48:33.552 --> 02:48:34.528
MATT: We're getting to
that point in the night.

02:48:34.552 --> 02:48:37.528
LAURA: It's just a matter of
whether or not we want to burn,

02:48:37.552 --> 02:48:39.528
you know, 5th-level spells to do
this. TALIESIN: It would be
everything we've got.

02:48:39.552 --> 02:48:41.762
LAURA: Yeah, we've got, so.

02:48:43.345 --> 02:48:44.904
I mean.

02:48:44.928 --> 02:48:47.447
It's probably more important
to try to get there right now,

02:48:47.471 --> 02:48:48.528
right? Burn through it?

02:48:48.552 --> 02:48:49.738
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

02:48:49.762 --> 02:48:51.447
But after this--

02:48:51.471 --> 02:48:52.280
LAURA: This is the last one?

02:48:52.304 --> 02:48:53.071
LIAM: I really want to--

02:48:53.095 --> 02:48:55.528
No, I mean, tomorrow,
and tomorrow--

02:48:55.552 --> 02:48:57.946
Uh-oh. (laughs)

02:48:57.970 --> 02:49:00.928
I want to try to be conservative

02:49:02.012 --> 02:49:03.696
with our abilities.

02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:04.821
LAURA: Yeah.

02:49:04.845 --> 02:49:06.654
LIAM: For many reasons.

02:49:06.678 --> 02:49:07.571
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: But right now,

02:49:07.595 --> 02:49:10.488
we are stuck up a
tree, or a mountain, so

02:49:10.512 --> 02:49:12.029
we'll go again.

02:49:12.053 --> 02:49:13.845
LAURA: We'll go again.
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

02:49:15.552 --> 02:49:17.405
Caduceus, hang on to
your butt! (whooshing)

02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:18.196
TALIESIN: Wow.
LAURA: Here,

02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:20.571
Fjord, get on my back
before I turn into an eagle,

02:49:20.595 --> 02:49:21.528
it'll be fun.

02:49:21.552 --> 02:49:22.488
Okay.

02:49:22.512 --> 02:49:23.528
TALIESIN: Throw
another spell into you.

02:49:23.552 --> 02:49:24.946
LAURA: (hand rubbing)
LIAM: (eagle squawk)

02:49:24.970 --> 02:49:25.738
LAURA: (poofing)

02:49:25.762 --> 02:49:27.405
TRAVIS: It blows my arms back--
MATT: I was about to say, yeah,

02:49:27.429 --> 02:49:28.863
make a strength saving throw.
TRAVIS: (pained yell)

02:49:28.887 --> 02:49:30.696
(laughter)

02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:33.280
Just a (squelching).

02:49:33.304 --> 02:49:34.988
TRAVIS: Ugh, oh! Six.

02:49:35.012 --> 02:49:35.803
LAURA: Oh no!
MATT: Six?

02:49:36.845 --> 02:49:37.738
SAM: Dislocated.

02:49:37.762 --> 02:49:39.321
MATT: It doesn't
dislocate your arms,

02:49:39.345 --> 02:49:42.071
but you do get pushed
back off of her,

02:49:42.095 --> 02:49:44.196
hit the snow, and
begin to slide.

02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:48.528
TRAVIS: (panicked yell) LAURA:
Oh no! I grab you. (laughs)

02:49:48.552 --> 02:49:50.612
MATT: Between the two of
you, you catch him before

02:49:50.636 --> 02:49:52.405
he slides off the
edge and tumbles

02:49:52.429 --> 02:49:53.904
hundreds of feet into
the ravine below.

02:49:53.928 --> 02:49:55.571
LIAM: Could have
had a Willow moment.

02:49:55.595 --> 02:49:59.904
(laughter)

02:49:59.928 --> 02:50:02.488
MATT: But with that, you
pick up for a third bit.

02:50:02.512 --> 02:50:04.363
The storm is not as
strong as it was,

02:50:04.387 --> 02:50:05.488
but it's still strong enough.

02:50:05.512 --> 02:50:07.071
I need you both-- the
DC is a little lower,

02:50:07.095 --> 02:50:08.821
but go ahead and both
roll either with your

02:50:08.845 --> 02:50:10.696
strength or dex bonus.

02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:12.196
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:13.571
LIAM: Oh, thank god!

02:50:13.595 --> 02:50:14.571
MATT: What's your total?

02:50:14.595 --> 02:50:15.528
LIAM: Six.

02:50:15.552 --> 02:50:17.904
MATT: Okay, the
natural 20 does help,

02:50:17.928 --> 02:50:19.988
it's considered two
successes versus one failure,

02:50:20.012 --> 02:50:23.447
so you're real
lucky you got that.

02:50:23.471 --> 02:50:26.946
LIAM: ♪ That's
fuckin' teamwork! ♪

02:50:26.970 --> 02:50:29.779
MATT: So, you can watch
as Caleb is starting to

02:50:29.803 --> 02:50:31.029
have a hard time keeping pace

02:50:31.053 --> 02:50:34.321
and you come up from behind
and give a tail wind,

02:50:34.345 --> 02:50:35.321
like bluff the side of him,

02:50:35.345 --> 02:50:37.405
and help block the
wind from hitting him.

02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:40.363
And with that, you begin
to make your way down--

02:50:40.387 --> 02:50:41.447
LAURA: ♪ Makin' your way ♪

02:50:41.471 --> 02:50:42.904
MATT: Wow.

02:50:42.928 --> 02:50:45.528
SAM: If you had said it
was snowing, I might say,

02:50:45.552 --> 02:50:47.528
"Flakin' its way," but--

02:50:47.552 --> 02:50:48.863
MATT: Oh no, it's evolving.

02:50:48.887 --> 02:50:50.528
(laughter)

02:50:50.552 --> 02:50:53.528
You eventually begin to push
through the worst of the storm,

02:50:53.552 --> 02:50:56.363
and you begin to see the
mountain range below subside,

02:50:56.387 --> 02:51:01.155
leading into a somewhat
familiar valley

02:51:01.179 --> 02:51:04.363
of broken ice, stone--
LAURA: Oh, we're already there!

02:51:04.387 --> 02:51:05.363
Yeah, that was great.

02:51:05.387 --> 02:51:09.528
MATT: --and right as the
spell begins to reach its end,

02:51:09.552 --> 02:51:12.571
as you begin to descend
rapidly to catch the ground

02:51:12.595 --> 02:51:14.280
at the very base of
the mountain range,

02:51:14.304 --> 02:51:15.779
which is now to your south,

02:51:15.803 --> 02:51:17.528
you glance out ahead,
and you can see

02:51:17.552 --> 02:51:20.528
the clouds are now
passing further east

02:51:20.552 --> 02:51:21.528
to where there's a little
bit of a break ahead

02:51:21.552 --> 02:51:22.946
where your vision
is a little better,

02:51:22.970 --> 02:51:25.528
and you can see now
at this distance,

02:51:25.552 --> 02:51:27.612
a different perspective
but the same view,

02:51:27.636 --> 02:51:32.196
of the massive,
odd, sunken valley

02:51:32.220 --> 02:51:33.845
that houses the Ruins of Aeor.

02:51:35.095 --> 02:51:36.528
LIAM: All ice spires?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:39.528
LAURA: Do we get a
cooler view of it?

02:51:39.552 --> 02:51:41.529
Does anything catch our eye now
that we can see it from above?

02:51:41.553 --> 02:51:42.863
LIAM: Like an aerial view?
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:51:42.887 --> 02:51:44.696
TALIESIN: I'll join on that one.

02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:46.095
LIAM: Yes.

02:51:46.970 --> 02:51:47.738
TALIESIN: Nope.

02:51:47.762 --> 02:51:49.238
LAURA: Nope, like 12.

02:51:49.262 --> 02:51:50.528
TALIESIN: 13.

02:51:50.552 --> 02:51:51.928
LIAM: Dammit, Bobby.

02:51:53.053 --> 02:51:54.528
MATT: Not any real
additional detail,

02:51:54.552 --> 02:51:55.447
but it is definitely--

02:51:55.471 --> 02:51:56.571
LAURA: What about, is
the storm less now,

02:51:56.595 --> 02:51:59.779
do I get advantage on my
perception for this one?

02:51:59.803 --> 02:52:00.845
MATT: No.

02:52:05.762 --> 02:52:08.405
SAM: Do we get a sense for
how far we are? Could--

02:52:08.429 --> 02:52:11.528
TALIESIN: I drop Find the
Path to do that d4 thing,

02:52:11.552 --> 02:52:13.528
I had to drop Find the
Path, it was worth it.

02:52:13.552 --> 02:52:14.571
LIAM: Well done, yeah.

02:52:14.595 --> 02:52:18.071
MATT: So as you all come land
at the base of the mountains,

02:52:18.095 --> 02:52:19.552
forms dropped,

02:52:21.053 --> 02:52:21.821
you gather, probably,

02:52:21.845 --> 02:52:24.029
it's another day's travel or so,

02:52:24.053 --> 02:52:25.363
or a little less
than a day's travel

02:52:25.387 --> 02:52:27.363
before you get to the Outpost.

02:52:27.387 --> 02:52:30.363
So you did make some
good time with that.

02:52:30.387 --> 02:52:31.988
SAM: Should we-- LIAM: So what
time of day, I'm sorry, go
ahead.

02:52:32.012 --> 02:52:33.528
SAM: No, I was just going
to say, should we just

02:52:33.552 --> 02:52:36.803
continue on through the
night? And get there?

02:52:38.387 --> 02:52:41.946
TALIESIN: Let's see what the
weather-- can you do the house?

02:52:41.970 --> 02:52:44.654
LAURA: No, because we don't want
to go into all of this
exhausted.

02:52:44.678 --> 02:52:47.137
SAM: Well, we'll get there
a day earlier, though.

02:52:48.012 --> 02:52:50.280
TALIESIN: We can take a--

02:52:50.304 --> 02:52:51.528
well, if we're only a day away,

02:52:51.552 --> 02:52:53.179
then it hardly
matters, I suppose.

02:52:54.345 --> 02:52:55.552
Let's see how it goes.

02:52:59.471 --> 02:53:00.863
LAURA: What does the
Wild Mother tell you?

02:53:00.887 --> 02:53:02.528
Does she tell you
we should sleep?

02:53:02.552 --> 02:53:04.528
TALIESIN: The Wild Mother says
that when it gets dark and cold,

02:53:04.552 --> 02:53:06.696
you should sleep, and then when
it warms up and gets light,

02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:08.155
you should move.
LAURA: Okay.

02:53:08.179 --> 02:53:10.528
TRAVIS: I did not
know that, hmm.

02:53:10.552 --> 02:53:13.904
LAURA: Let's keep moving
until it's dark and cold.

02:53:13.928 --> 02:53:15.512
TALIESIN: Nature is
its own language.

02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:17.528
LAURA: Yeah?

02:53:17.552 --> 02:53:19.528
LIAM: Is that code for '"go to
the end of the day and rest"?

02:53:19.552 --> 02:53:20.528
LAURA: Yeah, that's--
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:53:20.552 --> 02:53:23.863
LIAM: Good, because I
am also worried about,

02:53:23.887 --> 02:53:26.113
you know, we were talking
about negotiating, perhaps,

02:53:26.137 --> 02:53:28.488
but there is a chance
they will just drop on us.

02:53:28.512 --> 02:53:29.488
TRAVIS: Yep.
LIAM: And we are--

02:53:29.512 --> 02:53:30.696
you and I are fucked up.

02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:32.488
TRAVIS: And actually with
that, I'll summon the sword

02:53:32.512 --> 02:53:34.821
and cast See Invisibility
because we haven't done that
once

02:53:34.845 --> 02:53:36.528
since we've been
wearing these necklaces.

02:53:36.552 --> 02:53:37.738
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:53:37.762 --> 02:53:40.238
All right, make a
perception check for me.

02:53:40.262 --> 02:53:43.528
LAURA: Oh gosh, what if they're
just still scrying on us?

02:53:43.552 --> 02:53:44.779
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:53:44.803 --> 02:53:46.528
(cheering)
MATT: Damn!

02:53:46.552 --> 02:53:48.488
Getting that shit.
TRAVIS: 23.

02:53:48.512 --> 02:53:52.113
MATT: So as the sword apparates
out of your hand, Fjord,

02:53:52.137 --> 02:53:55.238
and as you bring it ahead of
you, the energy glows off,

02:53:55.262 --> 02:53:57.528
and you watch as the
blade begins to glow,

02:53:57.552 --> 02:53:59.280
and this energy from
behind Fjord's eyes

02:53:59.304 --> 02:54:00.071
begins to glow with it.

02:54:00.095 --> 02:54:03.113
And with that, your sight
clicks into the spectrum

02:54:03.137 --> 02:54:05.738
beyond what is normally
capable of mortals.

02:54:05.762 --> 02:54:09.095
Glancing about, you
get a very keen view,

02:54:10.553 --> 02:54:13.447
and no sign of any
sort of drifting,

02:54:13.471 --> 02:54:17.155
invisible arcane orbs,

02:54:17.179 --> 02:54:18.571
viewing portals, nothing.

02:54:18.595 --> 02:54:20.071
TRAVIS: Money well spent.

02:54:20.095 --> 02:54:21.196
We are clear.

02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:22.387
TALIESIN: Billboards.

02:54:24.803 --> 02:54:25.988
TALIESIN: I assume
there's advertising.

02:54:26.012 --> 02:54:26.779
MATT: There's a blimp,

02:54:26.803 --> 02:54:28.779
but I figured that
wasn't pertinent to this.

02:54:28.803 --> 02:54:30.528
MARISHA: #NotSponsored.

02:54:30.552 --> 02:54:31.946
TALIESIN: (laughs)

02:54:31.970 --> 02:54:33.053
MATT: Not an ad.

02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:37.405
So, what's the plan?

02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:40.696
LIAM: Just to trudge until
it is too dark to feel safe,

02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:41.904
and then we will plunk down,

02:54:41.928 --> 02:54:43.155
so a little bit further.

02:54:43.179 --> 02:54:44.196
MATT: A little
bit further, yeah.

02:54:44.220 --> 02:54:46.029
With the travel
to the mountains,

02:54:46.053 --> 02:54:48.113
the travel then to
the range there,

02:54:48.137 --> 02:54:52.528
and you guys left the grove
a little bit before noon,

02:54:52.552 --> 02:54:54.821
so you're getting
pretty close to dusk.

02:54:54.845 --> 02:54:56.779
You probably have another
hour, or under an hour

02:54:56.803 --> 02:54:59.304
of light before you hit night.

02:55:00.552 --> 02:55:03.528
And the days here are probably
a little shorter, anyway.

02:55:03.552 --> 02:55:06.779
So you continue to push.

02:55:06.803 --> 02:55:09.488
And push for this final hour.

02:55:09.512 --> 02:55:13.196
As the light begins to go,
so does the temperature.

02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:15.238
While it is not a raging
storm, thankfully,

02:55:15.262 --> 02:55:17.529
there is still a cutting
breeze that blows through.

02:55:17.553 --> 02:55:20.321
There is no snowfall, there
doesn't appear to be moisture,

02:55:20.345 --> 02:55:23.280
enough moisture in
the air to exhibit

02:55:23.304 --> 02:55:25.552
any sort of storm front,

02:55:26.552 --> 02:55:29.654
but it's enough to remind you
just how desolate and biting

02:55:29.678 --> 02:55:31.528
this landscape is.

02:55:31.552 --> 02:55:34.280
As the final bits of
light begin to vanish

02:55:34.304 --> 02:55:37.845
into the blue-purple
twilight horizon,

02:55:39.803 --> 02:55:42.552
the choice is yours to continue
or bed down for the eve.

02:55:43.552 --> 02:55:46.029
SAM: I make one more
vote to keep going.

02:55:46.053 --> 02:55:47.029
TRAVIS: I second it.

02:55:47.053 --> 02:55:49.863
ASHLEY: I third it,
but I also know--

02:55:49.887 --> 02:55:50.904
TALIESIN: What
happens if something--

02:55:50.928 --> 02:55:53.529
what happens if we
run into anything?

02:55:53.553 --> 02:55:56.528
LAURA: Well, it could--

02:55:56.552 --> 02:55:58.988
SAM: What happens if
something attacks us here?

02:55:59.012 --> 02:56:02.612
TALIESIN: We'll be inside
a house, so nothing.

02:56:02.636 --> 02:56:05.863
We either choose to be safe,
no matter what, or we--

02:56:05.887 --> 02:56:08.528
LAURA: I say we go waste
another spell slot,

02:56:08.552 --> 02:56:10.738
we go for another
hour, as far as we can,

02:56:10.762 --> 02:56:12.552
and then we do the tower.

02:56:13.552 --> 02:56:15.155
LIAM: We cannot do the tower.

02:56:15.179 --> 02:56:16.678
We would do the dome.

02:56:17.595 --> 02:56:19.280
Because I teleported us here.

02:56:19.304 --> 02:56:21.405
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, that's
okay, dome's good.

02:56:21.429 --> 02:56:22.779
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:56:22.803 --> 02:56:24.612
TRAVIS: No eyes,
no scrying, so--

02:56:24.636 --> 02:56:25.552
LAURA: Okay.

02:56:27.304 --> 02:56:29.321
TRAVIS: Unless they just
happen upon us in the middle of

02:56:29.345 --> 02:56:32.029
fucking Eiselcross, we should
be all right in the dome.

02:56:32.053 --> 02:56:34.113
LIAM: We <i>should</i>
be all right.

02:56:34.137 --> 02:56:34.928
SAM: Okay.

02:56:36.053 --> 02:56:37.405
TALIESIN: I feel like
it's your comfortability.

02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:38.196
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:40.113
SAM: Dome it up, then.

02:56:40.137 --> 02:56:43.155
LIAM: Yeah, let's dome
it up or fly it up--

02:56:43.179 --> 02:56:46.738
LAURA: One more hour.
One more hour of flying.

02:56:46.762 --> 02:56:48.528
And then dome it up.

02:56:48.552 --> 02:56:50.528
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, it's
risk, but it's a small risk,

02:56:50.552 --> 02:56:51.321
let's do it.

02:56:51.345 --> 02:56:54.363
LAURA: Okay. One
more hour of flying.

02:56:54.387 --> 02:56:55.904
MATT: One more hour
of flying? Okay.

02:56:55.928 --> 02:56:57.262
TALIESIN: The owls, or--?

02:56:58.552 --> 02:57:01.779
LAURA: I mean, owls are
not as strong as eagles,

02:57:01.803 --> 02:57:04.363
so I think we should
still be eagles.

02:57:04.387 --> 02:57:06.863
TALIESIN: Will you be
able to see in the dark?

02:57:06.887 --> 02:57:08.779
LIAM: Yeah, that's a trade off.

02:57:08.803 --> 02:57:10.654
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

02:57:10.678 --> 02:57:12.029
TALIESIN: Unless there's some--

02:57:12.053 --> 02:57:13.029
LIAM: Keen hearing and sight,

02:57:13.053 --> 02:57:14.654
the owl has advantage
on perception checks

02:57:14.678 --> 02:57:16.988
that rely on hearing or sight,

02:57:17.012 --> 02:57:18.595
so we could listen hard.

02:57:20.845 --> 02:57:22.447
MATT: It's hard to
listen at a distance.

02:57:22.471 --> 02:57:23.904
Listen is more for proximity.

02:57:23.928 --> 02:57:26.113
LIAM: Okay. And it's
still storming, right?

02:57:26.137 --> 02:57:27.528
Is it like-- (imitates wind)

02:57:27.552 --> 02:57:28.612
MATT: There's wind
blowing, yeah.

02:57:28.636 --> 02:57:29.821
It's not a storm, per se,

02:57:29.845 --> 02:57:31.321
but there is a
biting wind blowing.

02:57:31.345 --> 02:57:32.571
LIAM: Then it cancels
out, then we might as well

02:57:32.595 --> 02:57:34.179
just stick with eagle.

02:57:36.552 --> 02:57:37.488
LAURA: Yeah?

02:57:37.512 --> 02:57:38.280
TRAVIS: Call it?

02:57:38.304 --> 02:57:39.321
LIAM: Yeah.

02:57:39.345 --> 02:57:40.528
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

02:57:40.552 --> 02:57:42.654
LAURA: Owls don't
have dark vision?

02:57:42.678 --> 02:57:44.238
That's weird, since
they're night creatures.

02:57:44.262 --> 02:57:45.113
LIAM: They do.

02:57:45.137 --> 02:57:45.904
TALIESIN: Owls have dark vision.

02:57:45.928 --> 02:57:47.696
LIAM: Dark vision, 120 feet.

02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:50.155
LAURA: Then we should do owls.

02:57:50.179 --> 02:57:53.095
LIAM: They don't fly
as fast. Yeah. Sure.

02:57:54.137 --> 02:57:56.552
MATT: Your call. Owls or eagles?

02:57:57.887 --> 02:57:59.528
LIAM: Let's do
owls, let's do owls.

02:57:59.552 --> 02:58:00.447
LAURA: Okay.

02:58:00.471 --> 02:58:05.387
MATT: Okay. Owl
and eagles appear.

02:58:06.803 --> 02:58:08.387
So owls.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:58:09.262 --> 02:58:11.155
MATT: What's the strength
value on the owl?

02:58:11.179 --> 02:58:13.528
LIAM: It is 13, plus 1.

02:58:13.552 --> 02:58:15.904
MATT: Versus the
eagle, which was--?

02:58:15.928 --> 02:58:17.280
LIAM: One moment, please.

02:58:17.304 --> 02:58:19.528
LAURA: 16?

02:58:19.552 --> 02:58:21.029
Would it be stupid,
is that dumb?

02:58:21.053 --> 02:58:22.447
LIAM: 16.

02:58:22.471 --> 02:58:24.863
LAURA: That's a big difference.
Would we not be able to carry--

02:58:24.887 --> 02:58:26.321
MATT: You're going to be
moving a little bit slower.

02:58:26.345 --> 02:58:28.280
LIAM: We've done it before, so
we would know from the past.

02:58:28.304 --> 02:58:31.528
MATT: Correct. So if
you want to go owls,

02:58:31.552 --> 02:58:32.528
you're probably going to
go a little bit slower

02:58:32.552 --> 02:58:35.304
with this group
you're holding onto,

02:58:36.179 --> 02:58:38.528
just because you only move as
fast as the slowest of you.

02:58:38.552 --> 02:58:40.071
But you will be able
to see in the dark

02:58:40.095 --> 02:58:41.946
and have stealth
bonuses when you travel.

02:58:41.970 --> 02:58:42.738
LAURA: That seems smart, yeah.

02:58:42.762 --> 02:58:44.363
LIAM: At this point, yeah.
LAURA: That's smarter.

02:58:44.387 --> 02:58:45.280
MATT: Okay.

02:58:45.304 --> 02:58:46.803
LIAM: We also
already said it, so--

02:58:47.595 --> 02:58:48.528
MATT: But just
wanted to make sure

02:58:48.552 --> 02:58:50.528
you made the informed decision,
because you would know.

02:58:50.552 --> 02:58:51.904
LIAM: Have you met us before?

02:58:51.928 --> 02:58:53.863
(laughter)

02:58:53.887 --> 02:58:55.429
MATT: Got to have hope, man.

02:58:57.803 --> 02:59:00.845
With that, quietly
the two owls take off.

02:59:02.553 --> 02:59:06.821
The wind blowing helps cover
any sound that may come

02:59:06.845 --> 02:59:10.612
from the already super quiet
wings of these two owls.

02:59:10.636 --> 02:59:11.571
I will need need you both

02:59:11.595 --> 02:59:13.528
to make stealth
checks for me, please.

02:59:13.552 --> 02:59:15.696
LAURA: Stealth checks?
LIAM: Stealth checks.

02:59:15.720 --> 02:59:17.528
With the owls.
TRAVIS: Owls have advantage

02:59:17.552 --> 02:59:19.529
because their feathers don't
make sound when they fly,

02:59:19.553 --> 02:59:21.488
according to the--

02:59:21.512 --> 02:59:22.552
LAURA: So we get advantage?

02:59:25.928 --> 02:59:27.363
TRAVIS: National
Geographic, Matt.

02:59:27.387 --> 02:59:28.528
MATT: No, on the stat block,

02:59:28.552 --> 02:59:30.113
does it give you a
bonus to stealth, or--?

02:59:30.137 --> 02:59:30.904
LIAM: Not that I'm aware of.

02:59:30.928 --> 02:59:32.363
LAURA: No, it's just a plus 9.

02:59:32.387 --> 02:59:35.155
LIAM: No, and I
rolled total balls.

02:59:35.179 --> 02:59:36.863
LAURA: I rolled
pretty ballsy, too.

02:59:36.887 --> 02:59:39.528
But I got 13 total.

02:59:39.552 --> 02:59:40.863
MATT: 13, okay, and--?

02:59:40.887 --> 02:59:42.863
LIAM: 4 total.

02:59:42.887 --> 02:59:43.946
LAURA: Wait, no,
that's not possible!

02:59:43.970 --> 02:59:45.988
We have a plus nine
to stealth bonus

02:59:46.012 --> 02:59:47.321
as an owl.
LIAM: As an owl?

02:59:47.345 --> 02:59:48.528
LAURA: As an owl. LIAM: Where
does it say that on the--

02:59:48.552 --> 02:59:49.654
I didn't see it on--
LAURA: Giant Owl.

02:59:49.678 --> 02:59:52.196
Skills: Stealth plus
nine, perception plus 10.

02:59:52.220 --> 02:59:54.529
TRAVIS: Owl's feathers don't
make a sound when they fly.

02:59:54.553 --> 02:59:56.946
LIAM: Oh, there it is.
Plus four to stealth.

02:59:56.970 --> 02:59:58.196
MATT: Yeah, it's plus four.

02:59:58.220 --> 02:59:59.528
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Wait, what?

02:59:59.552 --> 03:00:01.529
Giant Owl.

03:00:01.553 --> 03:00:02.528
LIAM: I'm looking at it.

03:00:02.552 --> 03:00:05.552
LAURA: Skills: stealth plus
nine, perception plus 10.

03:00:06.678 --> 03:00:08.071
SAM: What'chu looking at?

03:00:08.095 --> 03:00:10.552
LAURA: It says 'Giant
Owl. Large beast.'

03:00:11.552 --> 03:00:12.654
LIAM: I'm not looking
at D&amp;D Beyond,

03:00:12.678 --> 03:00:14.363
I'm looking at a
secondary thing.

03:00:14.387 --> 03:00:15.196
MATT: I'm looking at D&amp;D Beyond,

03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:17.863
and it says "perception plus
five, stealth plus four."

03:00:17.887 --> 03:00:20.029
LAURA: I'm looking at
a Ranger's Companion.

03:00:20.053 --> 03:00:22.155
I'm looking at a Giant
Owl Beast Companion.

03:00:22.179 --> 03:00:24.029
MATT: Oh, gotcha, gotcha.

03:00:24.053 --> 03:00:25.612
LAURA: Which is weird
that it's different

03:00:25.636 --> 03:00:27.447
than just being a regular owl.

03:00:27.471 --> 03:00:28.779
LIAM: And you bless us?

03:00:28.803 --> 03:00:30.280
TALIESIN: In theory, I've
been pumping it into you,

03:00:30.304 --> 03:00:31.612
so you should get
a d4 from that.

03:00:31.636 --> 03:00:33.528
LIAM: Let's keep doing it.
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep
pumping.

03:00:33.552 --> 03:00:35.447
SAM: Pumping it into them.
LIAM: Seven for me.

03:00:35.471 --> 03:00:37.363
Totally changes everything.
SAM: On your personal mount.

03:00:37.387 --> 03:00:39.528
LAURA: I mean, I
don't know if it's

03:00:39.552 --> 03:00:40.612
a lot different than
everything else,

03:00:40.636 --> 03:00:41.904
but that sucks.

03:00:41.928 --> 03:00:46.029
So I only rolled an eight, if
it's only a plus four. LIAM: I
rolled a two on the 20, plus
four is six.

03:00:46.053 --> 03:00:47.529
MATT: Okay, got it.

03:00:47.553 --> 03:00:48.528
TRAVIS: Numbers.

03:00:48.552 --> 03:00:52.946
MATT: You guys-- the
wind does not prevent you

03:00:52.970 --> 03:00:55.803
from cleaving through
the air without issue.

03:00:56.636 --> 03:01:00.528
Quietly, you assume, you
traverse through the sky

03:01:00.552 --> 03:01:02.803
in the direction that you recall

03:01:03.636 --> 03:01:07.012
will lead you closest to
the Outpost in the morrow.

03:01:10.095 --> 03:01:12.571
Nothing seems to pay
mind in the darkness.

03:01:12.595 --> 03:01:14.071
Nothing blocks your path.

03:01:14.095 --> 03:01:16.678
Nothing catches your
attention, sound nor sight.

03:01:18.887 --> 03:01:21.512
An hour passes, you've
made some progress.

03:01:22.512 --> 03:01:24.528
But you find yourself
having to land soon,

03:01:24.552 --> 03:01:26.220
amongst the darkness below.

03:01:28.262 --> 03:01:30.946
I'd like you to both
make perception checks.

03:01:30.970 --> 03:01:35.363
You do have dark vision, which
means you do not have to--

03:01:35.387 --> 03:01:36.528
LIAM: There's no disadvantage.

03:01:36.552 --> 03:01:37.528
MATT: Exactly, but
you do have advantage

03:01:37.552 --> 03:01:38.488
because of keen
hearing and sight,

03:01:38.512 --> 03:01:39.821
so you both have advantage
on the perception check.

03:01:39.845 --> 03:01:42.071
LAURA: That's good. MATT:
So add the wisdom modifier--

03:01:42.095 --> 03:01:43.571
or perception,
which is plus five.

03:01:43.595 --> 03:01:45.280
LIAM: So much better.

03:01:45.304 --> 03:01:47.280
21, plus that d4.

03:01:47.304 --> 03:01:48.528
TALIESIN: Plus that d4.
LAURA: That's great.

03:01:48.552 --> 03:01:49.447
MATT: That's where the
owls really come in handy.

03:01:49.471 --> 03:01:51.196
LIAM: 28!
LAURA: 16.

03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:53.488
MATT: 16, that's still--
28's pretty slick.

03:01:53.512 --> 03:01:55.280
LIAM: Hoo hoo hoo.

03:01:55.304 --> 03:01:58.738
MATT: You do see, as
you begin to come down,

03:01:58.762 --> 03:02:00.552
you were a little bit off track,

03:02:01.387 --> 03:02:03.220
but you're towards the outer

03:02:05.636 --> 03:02:10.321
southwestern to south edge
of the Aeorian caldera,

03:02:10.345 --> 03:02:13.654
where the valley
begins to sink a bit.

03:02:13.678 --> 03:02:16.528
And you see one
shelf of broken rock

03:02:16.552 --> 03:02:18.654
that has been pushed up,

03:02:18.678 --> 03:02:20.528
and you can-- now on this side,

03:02:20.552 --> 03:02:22.612
which you haven't seen up close,

03:02:22.636 --> 03:02:25.405
you can see where there is
almost smaller mountains

03:02:25.429 --> 03:02:27.654
and hills that are pushed
up around an impact.

03:02:27.678 --> 03:02:31.029
Something-- the city,
likely-- when it crashed,

03:02:31.053 --> 03:02:33.405
pushed up a lot of
surrounding stone and rock

03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:34.196
in the vicinity.

03:02:34.220 --> 03:02:36.696
You can see there's almost
a smaller mountain ridge

03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:38.029
along the edge.

03:02:38.053 --> 03:02:41.447
And you can see there's
probably, likely,

03:02:41.471 --> 03:02:43.280
some spaces there to sleep,

03:02:43.304 --> 03:02:46.654
to keep somewhat hidden
from the open plain around,

03:02:46.678 --> 03:02:48.654
as well as from the
elements, if needed.

03:02:48.678 --> 03:02:52.405
So with that, before the
spell comes to a conclusion,

03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:53.552
you find a spot.

03:02:54.552 --> 03:02:56.363
LIAM: Okay, so we can
put the dome up in one of

03:02:56.387 --> 03:02:59.345
these divots in the earth.

03:03:00.928 --> 03:03:01.720
I'm exhausted.

03:03:03.387 --> 03:03:04.528
I'm going to set about doing it,

03:03:04.552 --> 03:03:06.196
unless anyone has anything else?

03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:07.528
TALIESIN: No, I think
that's a good plan.

03:03:07.552 --> 03:03:10.528
I'm going to help pack some
snow on top of it once it's up.

03:03:10.552 --> 03:03:15.113
LIAM: Okay, 10 minutes later,
a white dome goes (foomph).

03:03:15.137 --> 03:03:15.904
MATT: Cool.

03:03:15.928 --> 03:03:17.612
TALIESIN: I'm going to
snowman the heck out of it.

03:03:17.636 --> 03:03:19.528
LAURA: I have a technical
question. MATT: Yes?

03:03:19.552 --> 03:03:21.321
LAURA: When we're
turning into creatures,

03:03:21.345 --> 03:03:23.528
should it be the
Wildshape creature,

03:03:23.552 --> 03:03:25.321
or we should choose the mount,

03:03:25.345 --> 03:03:27.071
because apparently all
the stats are different

03:03:27.095 --> 03:03:28.528
depending on which
one you choose.

03:03:28.552 --> 03:03:30.280
Because I just went
with Wildshape.

03:03:30.304 --> 03:03:31.762
LIAM: Treat it like
an enemy beast.

03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:36.321
MATT: Just do a search
for "giant owl."

03:03:36.345 --> 03:03:38.029
LAURA: Yeah, but
you have to choose

03:03:38.053 --> 03:03:39.528
what you want to add it in,

03:03:39.552 --> 03:03:40.552
which category.

03:03:42.887 --> 03:03:46.528
And there's Beast Companion,
Familiar, Infusion,

03:03:46.552 --> 03:03:48.552
Psychic, Wildshape, Mount, Pet.

03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:51.363
SAM: Mount, probably?

03:03:51.387 --> 03:03:53.280
MATT: I just go under Monsters
and search for "giant owl."

03:03:53.304 --> 03:03:55.155
LIAM: That's what
I've always done.

03:03:55.179 --> 03:03:56.447
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: I'm not sure.

03:03:56.471 --> 03:03:57.321
LIAM: Treat it like a rando.

03:03:57.345 --> 03:03:58.654
MATT: But I'm curious as to
what that set up is there,

03:03:58.678 --> 03:03:59.571
because that sounds
kind of cool.

03:03:59.595 --> 03:04:01.321
LAURA: Okay, I'll
show you later.

03:04:01.345 --> 03:04:02.137
MATT: No worries.

03:04:03.179 --> 03:04:04.528
I love the picture of
him, too. He's just like,

03:04:04.552 --> 03:04:07.179
"No. Not right now."
LAURA: I know, he's so cute.

03:04:08.179 --> 03:04:09.528
MATT: I love barn owls.

03:04:09.552 --> 03:04:11.528
TRAVIS: How many
licks does it take--

03:04:11.552 --> 03:04:13.447
LAURA: That's the David
Bowie owl right there.

03:04:13.471 --> 03:04:14.946
MATT: Oh yeah,
Labyrinth is strong.

03:04:14.970 --> 03:04:17.612
TRAVIS: One, two, three--
MATT: All righty, so.

03:04:17.636 --> 03:04:19.155
MARISHA: Such a dick, Mr. Owl.

03:04:19.179 --> 03:04:21.612
MATT: You gather up and
rest for the evening.

03:04:21.636 --> 03:04:24.821
Much warmer in the
entirety of this dome

03:04:24.845 --> 03:04:26.280
than it has been on
the journey here,

03:04:26.304 --> 03:04:28.528
and it is a welcome
shift in pace.

03:04:28.552 --> 03:04:30.612
But you rest for the night.

03:04:30.636 --> 03:04:31.779
Is there anything you want
to do for the evening?

03:04:31.803 --> 03:04:34.280
We'll go ahead and
cut to the morning.

03:04:34.304 --> 03:04:36.196
LIAM: I just have one question,

03:04:36.220 --> 03:04:39.196
because when I examined
that, when we got the collar

03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:41.071
working together in
the Plane of Fire,

03:04:41.095 --> 03:04:43.528
it was under duress
and exhaustion.

03:04:43.552 --> 03:04:44.779
So I know that we powered it,

03:04:44.803 --> 03:04:49.113
but I don't know if I
understand how it works.

03:04:49.137 --> 03:04:52.488
Do I need to fiddle with
it more to ascertain

03:04:52.512 --> 03:04:55.196
how to operate it, or have
I already figured that out

03:04:55.220 --> 03:04:55.988
with all of my--
MATT: I think

03:04:56.012 --> 03:04:57.654
you've figured it out with
the tinkering you've done.

03:04:57.678 --> 03:05:00.345
It is currently
functional and powered.

03:05:01.552 --> 03:05:04.887
It would need to be
affixed to somebody,

03:05:05.928 --> 03:05:09.155
which would likely involve
a successful grapple.

03:05:09.179 --> 03:05:10.528
LIAM: Right, manually.

03:05:10.552 --> 03:05:12.988
MATT: Correct. It would
be a contested grapple.

03:05:13.012 --> 03:05:14.552
And then once affixed,

03:05:16.512 --> 03:05:17.447
it functions.

03:05:17.471 --> 03:05:18.262
LIAM: Okay.

03:05:20.678 --> 03:05:23.488
TALIESIN: Couple of
questions before we bed down:

03:05:23.512 --> 03:05:25.528
Do you think we're going to
need Find a Path again tomorrow

03:05:25.552 --> 03:05:26.845
or should I put it away?

03:05:31.137 --> 03:05:33.238
LIAM: Kind of depends
on the weather.

03:05:33.262 --> 03:05:34.779
TALIESIN: I'll
keep it out, then.

03:05:34.803 --> 03:05:36.196
There's other things
I'd like to have.

03:05:36.220 --> 03:05:39.636
And do we want to talk to
Trent tonight or tomorrow?

03:05:41.304 --> 03:05:42.720
LAURA: I have
messages I can send.

03:05:45.552 --> 03:05:48.821
MARISHA: Feel like we need to
get to Essek first, personally.

03:05:48.845 --> 03:05:50.528
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's
a very good point.

03:05:50.552 --> 03:05:52.321
LAURA: Should I send
a message to Essek?

03:05:52.345 --> 03:05:54.528
LIAM: He might not be
willing to cooperate at all.

03:05:54.552 --> 03:05:55.471
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: So.

03:05:56.845 --> 03:05:58.904
TALIESIN: Best we defer.

03:05:58.928 --> 03:06:00.654
LIAM: Yeah, you can let
him know that we're close.

03:06:00.678 --> 03:06:02.113
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Be there tomorrow.

03:06:02.137 --> 03:06:02.928
LAURA: Okay.

03:06:04.429 --> 03:06:06.612
So we're like less
than a day away.

03:06:06.636 --> 03:06:09.528
We'll be there pretty soon.
How are you holding up?

03:06:09.552 --> 03:06:11.053
Don't freak out.

03:06:12.552 --> 03:06:15.720
Are you preparing for
our big battle, though?

03:06:18.137 --> 03:06:19.238
Woo!

03:06:19.262 --> 03:06:21.762
ASHLEY: (laughs)

03:06:24.552 --> 03:06:29.512
MATT: "I have
increased the guard.

03:06:31.387 --> 03:06:32.720
"Awaiting for your arrival.

03:06:36.552 --> 03:06:37.928
"We have a lot to discuss.

03:06:40.803 --> 03:06:44.595
"But the sight of
you will be welcome.

03:06:47.137 --> 03:06:49.095
"Hurry, and be safe."

03:06:51.552 --> 03:06:53.196
LAURA: He's doing okay.

03:06:53.220 --> 03:06:54.345
LIAM: Okay, good.

03:06:56.636 --> 03:06:57.528
MARISHA: Okay.

03:06:57.552 --> 03:06:59.155
TALIESIN: All right, then.

03:06:59.179 --> 03:07:01.904
TRAVIS: Do you want to ask
Vandran which jungle he's in?

03:07:01.928 --> 03:07:02.762
LAURA: You want me to?

03:07:04.595 --> 03:07:06.528
I'm going to send a message
to Vandran. TRAVIS: (stutters)

03:07:06.552 --> 03:07:08.528
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Too late!

03:07:08.552 --> 03:07:09.528
Thought you were being cute.

03:07:09.552 --> 03:07:11.528
TRAVIS: I did!
That's what I get.

03:07:11.552 --> 03:07:12.654
Stick your finger
in a mouse trap,

03:07:12.678 --> 03:07:14.528
you get fucking snapped.

03:07:14.552 --> 03:07:16.528
(laughter)

03:07:16.552 --> 03:07:18.904
LAURA: Hi!
TRAVIS: Oh g-- (laughs)

03:07:18.928 --> 03:07:19.928
LAURA: Me again.

03:07:20.887 --> 03:07:22.528
What jungle are you in?

03:07:22.552 --> 03:07:24.552
I'm with Fjord,
he's just wondering.

03:07:25.512 --> 03:07:28.571
He...misses you?

03:07:28.595 --> 03:07:31.946
Am I allowed to say that?

03:07:31.970 --> 03:07:32.762
He's--

03:07:33.887 --> 03:07:36.552
I don't know if I was
supposed to say that.

03:07:38.552 --> 03:07:40.113
SAM: "He misses you."

03:07:40.137 --> 03:07:42.946
(laughter)

03:07:42.970 --> 03:07:45.528
TRAVIS: Is it a verbal
message or a mental one?

03:07:45.552 --> 03:07:47.071
LAURA: I don't know.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:07:47.095 --> 03:07:48.779
MATT: I think you
speak it out loud.

03:07:48.803 --> 03:07:51.612
LAURA: Oh that, yeah, I
definitely speak it out.

03:07:51.636 --> 03:07:53.552
TRAVIS: I was
asking in my terror.

03:07:54.471 --> 03:07:55.552
TALIESIN: Actually,
that's a good question.

03:07:57.887 --> 03:07:59.304
MATT: It starts with a chuckle.

03:08:03.220 --> 03:08:05.552
"Not entirely sure who this is,

03:08:08.429 --> 03:08:11.196
"but I'm comfortable enough.

03:08:11.220 --> 03:08:13.528
"Somewhere near Bisaft."

03:08:13.552 --> 03:08:15.447
LAURA: Near Bisaft?

03:08:15.471 --> 03:08:16.970
MATT: "Not even really sure."

03:08:20.678 --> 03:08:22.238
SAM: It's in the ocean
somewhere, right?

03:08:22.262 --> 03:08:23.447
ASHLEY: Near the where?

03:08:23.471 --> 03:08:25.071
MATT: And that's it. LIAM: Yeah,
I remember it from the past,

03:08:25.095 --> 03:08:26.029
but I can't remember why.

03:08:26.053 --> 03:08:27.571
LAURA: Near Bisaft, he
says he's near Bisaft.

03:08:27.595 --> 03:08:29.029
TRAVIS: Shut up
and plan your game!

03:08:29.053 --> 03:08:30.528
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay!

03:08:30.552 --> 03:08:31.946
MARISHA: I'm pretty--

03:08:31.970 --> 03:08:33.238
SAM: I thought it
was in the ocean?

03:08:33.262 --> 03:08:35.321
ASHLEY: Near the staff?

03:08:35.345 --> 03:08:36.155
LAURA: Bisaft.

03:08:36.179 --> 03:08:39.678
SAM: Bisaft. B-I-S-A-F-T.

03:08:41.387 --> 03:08:45.405
We've passed through
there or something.

03:08:45.429 --> 03:08:46.220
LAURA: Did we?

03:08:48.053 --> 03:08:50.179
SAM: I remember seeing
it somewhere on a map.

03:08:51.552 --> 03:08:54.071
MARISHA: Yeah, it's out there.
SAM: Bisaft.

03:08:54.095 --> 03:08:56.988
LAURA: He seemed unsure
where he is, Fjord.

03:08:57.012 --> 03:08:58.471
SAM: Where is it? Where is it?

03:09:00.887 --> 03:09:02.262
LAURA: Where is it, Fjord?

03:09:05.552 --> 03:09:06.429
TRAVIS: Sure.

03:09:08.345 --> 03:09:09.113
Sure.

03:09:09.137 --> 03:09:09.928
LAURA: Where is it?

03:09:11.345 --> 03:09:16.345
TRAVIS: It's the nearest island
to where our ship exploded.

03:09:17.552 --> 03:09:19.053
Where we went down.

03:09:21.636 --> 03:09:22.552
MARISHA: Huh.

03:09:24.429 --> 03:09:25.220
TRAVIS: Maybe.

03:09:27.887 --> 03:09:28.654
(blows raspberry)

03:09:28.678 --> 03:09:30.779
Right, should have
thought to look there.

03:09:30.803 --> 03:09:34.528
Would have been the first
logical place to look.

03:09:34.552 --> 03:09:36.528
Where would you swim
if you survived?

03:09:36.552 --> 03:09:39.553
SAM: Has he been stranded
there this whole time?

03:09:41.552 --> 03:09:44.053
TRAVIS: (exhales)

03:09:45.387 --> 03:09:46.528
SAM: Well, no, he got a book.

03:09:46.552 --> 03:09:49.321
I mean, he's been
to civilization.

03:09:49.345 --> 03:09:51.113
TRAVIS: Or are there other
people on the island.

03:09:51.137 --> 03:09:53.429
I don't know, I'll
unpack that later.

03:09:54.552 --> 03:09:56.528
TALIESIN: I mean, we went to
sea with a copy of Tusk Love,

03:09:56.552 --> 03:09:57.612
maybe everybody does.

03:09:57.636 --> 03:10:00.447
SAM: That's true.
It's what you do.

03:10:00.471 --> 03:10:02.904
TRAVIS: Unless it was on the
ship and it was on the wreckage

03:10:02.928 --> 03:10:04.571
and washed up on the--

03:10:04.595 --> 03:10:07.029
LAURA: That would be why he
would read a book like that

03:10:07.053 --> 03:10:09.488
instead of, you
know, I don't know,

03:10:09.512 --> 03:10:10.528
maybe he likes things like that.

03:10:10.552 --> 03:10:11.803
TRAVIS: Because
it's all there is?

03:10:15.552 --> 03:10:19.220
It's fine, we have things
we are focusing on.

03:10:21.471 --> 03:10:22.262
LAURA: Okay.

03:10:24.137 --> 03:10:26.113
We have to make it out.

03:10:26.137 --> 03:10:27.345
TRAVIS: That's the plan.

03:10:29.304 --> 03:10:30.471
MARISHA: We all do.

03:10:32.845 --> 03:10:35.262
I know we all said
our goodbyes, but

03:10:38.552 --> 03:10:40.946
after watching you
and your family today,

03:10:40.970 --> 03:10:43.762
and you,

03:10:46.345 --> 03:10:47.179
I don't know.

03:10:49.552 --> 03:10:51.552
I'm prepared to die,

03:10:53.887 --> 03:10:55.636
but it's not fair to them.

03:10:58.552 --> 03:11:01.904
TALIESIN: I'm prepared to do
whatever it takes to save them.

03:11:01.928 --> 03:11:05.053
Dying may be involved, but

03:11:07.345 --> 03:11:08.595
I'm prepared to do the work.

03:11:11.887 --> 03:11:13.552
Preferably not dying.

03:11:16.262 --> 03:11:18.179
SAM: Yeah, I'm not
prepared to die.

03:11:19.053 --> 03:11:20.636
We've got to do this.

03:11:23.179 --> 03:11:25.405
MARISHA: You
definitely can't die.

03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:26.220
SAM: Nope!

03:11:33.970 --> 03:11:35.552
But hopefully none of us will.

03:11:38.970 --> 03:11:43.095
LIAM: If I feel the need
to, I will send just you

03:11:45.345 --> 03:11:46.137
back to them.

03:11:48.220 --> 03:11:49.654
SAM: You can do that?

03:11:49.678 --> 03:11:51.304
LIAM: Of course I can.

03:11:55.552 --> 03:11:58.345
SAM: Well, it
won't come to that.

03:12:04.345 --> 03:12:06.071
TRAVIS: Look how good we're
doing, we've got this.

03:12:06.095 --> 03:12:08.528
LAURA: We've totally got this.

03:12:08.552 --> 03:12:09.528
ASHLEY: We're going to be fine.

03:12:09.552 --> 03:12:11.528
TRAVIS: We made it back here,
we didn't end up in a mountain,

03:12:11.552 --> 03:12:14.304
we've closed the distance
in incredible time.

03:12:15.471 --> 03:12:17.488
LAURA: We're doing really good.

03:12:17.512 --> 03:12:18.304
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:12:19.552 --> 03:12:21.488
Eyes on the prize.

03:12:21.512 --> 03:12:23.113
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yep.

03:12:23.137 --> 03:12:25.696
TALIESIN: Don't use
the E word, but yes.

03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:26.988
LAURA: If I do die,

03:12:27.012 --> 03:12:28.528
I'm not saying I'm going to,

03:12:28.552 --> 03:12:29.488
but if I do--

03:12:29.512 --> 03:12:30.529
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:12:30.553 --> 03:12:33.196
LAURA: I promise I'll come
back and haunt you guys.

03:12:33.220 --> 03:12:36.696
One by one, you'll
get little surprises,

03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:38.471
it'll be so much fun.

03:12:40.471 --> 03:12:42.137
SAM: That would be cool.

03:12:43.552 --> 03:12:45.803
ASHLEY: Do you
have any requests?

03:12:46.845 --> 03:12:47.946
TRAVIS: What do you
mean? Last requests?

03:12:47.970 --> 03:12:49.528
LIAM: You going to
play us to sleep?

03:12:49.552 --> 03:12:52.552
ASHLEY: No, like, is
there anything any of you,

03:12:53.552 --> 03:12:56.447
if things go south, is
there anything that--

03:12:56.471 --> 03:12:58.280
SAM: You're just assuming
that you'll live.

03:12:58.304 --> 03:12:59.528
You'll live and--

03:12:59.552 --> 03:13:00.528
ASHLEY: I'm going
to be fine, yeah.

03:13:00.552 --> 03:13:01.447
SAM: Yeah, okay.

03:13:01.471 --> 03:13:04.280
TRAVIS: Same here, we're just
going to be the executors of
your will.

03:13:04.304 --> 03:13:06.612
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we'll just basically, yeah.

03:13:06.636 --> 03:13:08.738
I mean, you're all
going to be fine.

03:13:08.762 --> 03:13:11.887
SAM: Well, someone's going
to have to marry Yeza.

03:13:13.012 --> 03:13:13.779
ASHLEY: Well--

03:13:13.803 --> 03:13:14.654
SAM: It might have to be you.

03:13:14.678 --> 03:13:17.071
ASHLEY: I don't think
that's going to--

03:13:17.095 --> 03:13:18.528
SAM: You have to take
care of my child.

03:13:18.552 --> 03:13:19.988
TRAVIS: I mean, if you
have any porn lying around

03:13:20.012 --> 03:13:20.946
that you want us to get rid of

03:13:20.970 --> 03:13:22.528
or a browser history
you want us to clear,

03:13:22.552 --> 03:13:23.447
just say it now.

03:13:23.471 --> 03:13:24.821
TALIESIN: I have a lot
of eligible siblings,

03:13:24.845 --> 03:13:27.528
I'm just going to
put that out there.

03:13:27.552 --> 03:13:28.612
SAM: Yep, that's true.

03:13:28.636 --> 03:13:30.238
ASHLEY: Definitely delete my
browser history. TALIESIN:
Definitely know my parents are
eager to

03:13:30.262 --> 03:13:31.845
get rid of a couple of them.

03:13:35.552 --> 03:13:38.528
SAM: But, yeah, I mean, I think
if any of us don't make it,

03:13:38.552 --> 03:13:43.345
the others will vow to take
care of their families.

03:13:46.552 --> 03:13:50.528
I mean, do you want us
to hunt down Vandran

03:13:50.552 --> 03:13:54.863
and tell him how
much you missed him?

03:13:54.887 --> 03:13:56.571
Or-- or-- or--

03:13:56.595 --> 03:13:57.863
TRAVIS: Yes!
SAM: Or do anything?

03:13:57.887 --> 03:13:59.447
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

03:13:59.471 --> 03:14:00.946
I don't think I would have
to tell you that, though.

03:14:00.970 --> 03:14:02.552
I think you would do it anyway.

03:14:03.678 --> 03:14:06.429
I would look after all
of your next of kin.

03:14:07.678 --> 03:14:09.363
I know what you want.

03:14:09.387 --> 03:14:10.528
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: What do you want?

03:14:10.552 --> 03:14:11.946
Yeah, do you want us to draw

03:14:11.970 --> 03:14:13.528
dicks for the rest of our lives?

03:14:13.552 --> 03:14:15.447
LAURA: Aww, that
would be really sweet!

03:14:15.471 --> 03:14:17.845
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:14:18.887 --> 03:14:22.528
SAM: Should we, I mean,
should we follow the Traveler?

03:14:22.552 --> 03:14:26.071
LAURA: Oh, no, I don't
think he needs that anymore.

03:14:26.095 --> 03:14:27.405
But do keep him some company,

03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:30.696
because he's going to be real
bored if I'm, you know,
(clicks).

03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:34.137
I would say go visit
my mom, you know.

03:14:37.512 --> 03:14:40.179
Throw some chaos into her
life, it's good for her.

03:14:41.512 --> 03:14:42.552
SAM: And your dad, too?

03:14:43.636 --> 03:14:46.946
LAURA: He might provide enough
chaos now, I don't know.

03:14:46.970 --> 03:14:49.612
Ooh! If I'm not
around, and you are,

03:14:49.636 --> 03:14:52.571
you really have to make sure
they stay together, okay?

03:14:52.595 --> 03:14:55.363
Really Parent Trap them, if
it hasn't already happened.

03:14:55.387 --> 03:14:56.488
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Okay.

03:14:56.512 --> 03:15:01.528
SAM: Sure, I'll say
to The Gentleman

03:15:01.552 --> 03:15:05.821
that Marion is sick.

03:15:05.845 --> 03:15:08.113
How do you-- you can't break
up with a sick person, right?

03:15:08.137 --> 03:15:09.280
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: And then I'll tell

03:15:09.304 --> 03:15:11.803
Marion that The Gentleman

03:15:12.595 --> 03:15:14.654
is too scared to
confess his love to her

03:15:14.678 --> 03:15:16.904
and that'll, they'll
stay together.

03:15:16.928 --> 03:15:18.071
LAURA: That's perfect.
SAM: Yeah.

03:15:18.095 --> 03:15:20.029
LAURA: I think tricking
people into staying together

03:15:20.053 --> 03:15:23.029
is always the best possible way.

03:15:23.053 --> 03:15:27.095
And then, also, the other
thing I think you should do is,

03:15:29.595 --> 03:15:32.304
you, Caleb, if you
survive and I don't.

03:15:34.471 --> 03:15:35.988
LIAM: Well, that
will not happen.

03:15:36.012 --> 03:15:38.970
LAURA: You have to draw a
dick in every single temple.

03:15:40.179 --> 03:15:42.155
LIAM: Temples, specifically?

03:15:42.179 --> 03:15:44.113
LAURA: Every single temple
that you come across,

03:15:44.137 --> 03:15:46.262
there has to be one
dick you leave behind.

03:15:47.595 --> 03:15:48.571
LIAM: Well, I promise I will.

03:15:48.595 --> 03:15:49.779
LAURA: Okay.

03:15:49.803 --> 03:15:51.887
SAM: And what about
you, Mr. Caleb?

03:15:53.179 --> 03:15:55.528
Do you want us-- what
would be the thing

03:15:55.552 --> 03:15:58.196
that would make
you happy in death?

03:15:58.220 --> 03:16:03.029
Would it be us killing
Trent Ikithon? Or--

03:16:03.053 --> 03:16:04.345
LIAM: It couldn't hurt.

03:16:05.552 --> 03:16:07.887
I don't have any family
other than you all.

03:16:11.262 --> 03:16:15.137
Yeah, make sure that
no more children--

03:16:18.137 --> 03:16:20.113
(sighs)

03:16:20.137 --> 03:16:22.471
Or bent away from
their purpose in life.

03:16:25.762 --> 03:16:26.904
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:16:26.928 --> 03:16:28.447
LAURA: Not as much
fun as drawing dicks,

03:16:28.471 --> 03:16:29.821
but I'm down for that.

03:16:29.845 --> 03:16:30.636
We will do it.

03:16:35.552 --> 03:16:36.471
We'll do it.

03:16:37.762 --> 03:16:39.552
SAM: Beau, any requests?

03:16:42.137 --> 03:16:44.571
MARISHA: Kind of in
the same boat as Caleb.

03:16:44.595 --> 03:16:45.636
Yasha.

03:16:47.429 --> 03:16:48.595
You all are my family.

03:16:50.552 --> 03:16:55.155
Maybe make sure TJ, my
little brother, is okay.

03:16:55.179 --> 03:16:57.552
Still think him and Luc
would be good friends.

03:16:59.928 --> 03:17:02.053
I do have a request, though.

03:17:07.636 --> 03:17:09.553
I don't know what these eyes do.

03:17:12.552 --> 03:17:16.447
And I was hoping
that maybe I could

03:17:16.471 --> 03:17:17.738
gain some knowledge

03:17:17.762 --> 03:17:19.528
on how to use them
to our advantage,

03:17:19.552 --> 03:17:22.863
but if last night
told me anything,

03:17:22.887 --> 03:17:26.528
it feels like it's just
a device for Molly.

03:17:26.552 --> 03:17:27.553
Lucien.

03:17:29.179 --> 03:17:31.179
I don't know if I'll
ever stop doing that.

03:17:34.552 --> 03:17:35.720
If it goes bad,

03:17:37.720 --> 03:17:39.636
and I'm not on your
all's side anymore,

03:17:44.552 --> 03:17:45.552
(sighs)

03:17:46.512 --> 03:17:48.845
my request is for
you all to live.

03:17:51.345 --> 03:17:52.429
One way or another.

03:17:57.137 --> 03:17:58.762
If it goes bad, take me out.

03:18:02.552 --> 03:18:06.654
LIAM: There's a little puff
of sparkly cloud next to me,

03:18:06.678 --> 03:18:08.988
and a white cat
appears and trundles

03:18:09.012 --> 03:18:13.571
across the distance of the
dome and crawls into your lap

03:18:13.595 --> 03:18:16.552
and does a couple of
circles and scritches.

03:18:20.552 --> 03:18:21.552
MARISHA: What do you think?

03:18:23.803 --> 03:18:24.779
LIAM: I don't know,
what are the odds

03:18:24.803 --> 03:18:27.528
of us waking up changed again?

03:18:27.552 --> 03:18:29.387
MARISHA: Pretty strong.
LIAM: Pretty strong.

03:18:37.387 --> 03:18:39.387
If what she's talking
about does happen,

03:18:41.304 --> 03:18:43.095
if I am out of control,

03:18:46.845 --> 03:18:49.471
you will stop the problem.

03:18:50.552 --> 03:18:52.238
I'm calling my favor.

03:18:52.262 --> 03:18:54.552
If it comes to that,
you will stop me.

03:18:56.512 --> 03:18:57.304
Utterly.

03:19:01.552 --> 03:19:03.179
TRAVIS: I made you a promise.

03:19:09.762 --> 03:19:10.553
LIAM: Get them out.

03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:14.970
TRAVIS: It won't come to that.

03:19:16.137 --> 03:19:17.595
LIAM: No, we are
the Mighty Nein.

03:19:30.179 --> 03:19:31.738
(sighing)

03:19:31.762 --> 03:19:34.321
LAURA: Caleb, can you
put pretty visions

03:19:34.345 --> 03:19:36.238
on the dome tonight?

03:19:36.262 --> 03:19:37.970
MARISHA: Yeah,
that would be nice.

03:19:41.345 --> 03:19:42.137
LIAM: Hmm.

03:19:52.095 --> 03:19:52.887
Well.

03:19:56.887 --> 03:19:59.552
I start a

03:20:01.137 --> 03:20:04.345
small fire in the
center of the dome,

03:20:07.552 --> 03:20:09.155
which is not concentration.

03:20:09.179 --> 03:20:13.280
So a small fire
starts up and globules

03:20:13.304 --> 03:20:17.528
start to slowly rotate
around our heads,

03:20:17.552 --> 03:20:19.238
very, very slow,

03:20:19.262 --> 03:20:22.636
casting shadows that
are constantly moving.

03:20:23.552 --> 03:20:26.738
And the fire, using
Control Flames,

03:20:26.762 --> 03:20:30.304
begins to take one
shape after another.

03:20:32.678 --> 03:20:35.363
And then I just start running

03:20:35.387 --> 03:20:36.529
through things that
pop into my head.

03:20:36.553 --> 03:20:39.845
We see the crudest form of

03:20:40.845 --> 03:20:43.928
Marion and The
Gentleman dancing, and

03:20:46.636 --> 03:20:48.220
we see a ship at sea.

03:20:54.220 --> 03:20:59.238
We see the fire flatten
out into a plain

03:20:59.262 --> 03:21:03.280
and we see two feminine
forms at the center of it,

03:21:03.304 --> 03:21:04.762
sitting on the ground together.

03:21:08.803 --> 03:21:11.863
We see a little house,

03:21:11.887 --> 03:21:15.552
ringed in by a flaming forest.

03:21:22.179 --> 03:21:24.988
We see a tall figure
and a very short figure,

03:21:25.012 --> 03:21:28.345
walking through a
field of flaming grass.

03:21:35.762 --> 03:21:38.636
Eventually, it just
turns to plain, old fire

03:21:39.762 --> 03:21:42.720
and the globules dim.

03:21:44.552 --> 03:21:47.196
And in the dark, all
you hear is the sound

03:21:47.220 --> 03:21:49.345
of purring in the dome.

03:22:00.387 --> 03:22:04.552
MATT: One by one, as these
images fade from view,

03:22:06.095 --> 03:22:08.528
and the sound of purring
takes the interior

03:22:08.552 --> 03:22:11.654
of this safe space,
you all find yourselves

03:22:11.678 --> 03:22:14.220
to come to a night of rest.

03:22:18.304 --> 03:22:19.095
Eventually,

03:22:25.345 --> 03:22:27.552
a dream-filled night
comes to some of you.

03:22:29.762 --> 03:22:31.552
To others, a bit
disturbed sleep.

03:22:33.552 --> 03:22:35.636
But the morning does come.

03:22:42.636 --> 03:22:44.280
And you have a long rest.

03:22:44.304 --> 03:22:45.528
TRAVIS: We didn't
even take watches,

03:22:45.552 --> 03:22:46.821
in case you fuckers tripped out.

03:22:46.845 --> 03:22:48.113
MARISHA: Oh my god, we should
have. ASHLEY: I noticed.

03:22:48.137 --> 03:22:49.238
TRAVIS: What the fuck
is wrong with us?

03:22:49.262 --> 03:22:50.029
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:22:50.053 --> 03:22:51.528
TRAVIS: We're ready,
we're ready, we're ready.

03:22:51.552 --> 03:22:53.071
TALIESIN: We're going to be--

03:22:53.095 --> 03:22:55.779
TRAVIS: We're on
our guard. (laughs)

03:22:55.803 --> 03:22:56.988
TALIESIN: Are there any
footprints around the--

03:22:57.012 --> 03:22:58.528
LIAM: I was wiped out, you guys.

03:22:58.552 --> 03:22:59.612
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: I believe it.

03:22:59.636 --> 03:23:01.280
I believe it.
MATT: Make a perception check

03:23:01.304 --> 03:23:02.720
outside of the
dome, if you'd like.

03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:05.071
TALIESIN: 22.

03:23:05.095 --> 03:23:06.528
MATT: 22, pretty good.

03:23:06.552 --> 03:23:07.529
Glancing around the space,

03:23:07.553 --> 03:23:09.738
other than the footprints
that you left behind--

03:23:09.762 --> 03:23:10.528
TALIESIN: Still there.

03:23:10.552 --> 03:23:11.738
MATT: -- which are still there,

03:23:11.762 --> 03:23:13.528
no additional footprints.
TALIESIN: Cool.

03:23:13.552 --> 03:23:14.512
TRAVIS: No new snow?

03:23:15.471 --> 03:23:16.528
TALIESIN: No new snow.

03:23:16.552 --> 03:23:17.863
One bonus.

03:23:17.887 --> 03:23:19.179
ASHLEY: Any weird dreams?

03:23:20.137 --> 03:23:20.946
LAURA: Any more eyes?

03:23:20.970 --> 03:23:22.196
ASHLEY: You two?

03:23:22.220 --> 03:23:23.012
TALIESIN: Eye check.

03:23:24.552 --> 03:23:25.405
MARISHA: Ooh, it's cold.

03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:26.528
TALIESIN: Yep.
MARISHA: Ooh, it's cold.

03:23:26.552 --> 03:23:27.529
TRAVIS: All the way, all
the way. LIAM: No, it's not.

03:23:27.553 --> 03:23:29.488
It's not cold. It's
warm in here; it's nice.

03:23:29.512 --> 03:23:30.571
MARISHA: Oh, oh, okay.

03:23:30.595 --> 03:23:32.528
SAM: I was just blowing,
I was blowing on you.

03:23:32.552 --> 03:23:33.821
(laughter)

03:23:33.845 --> 03:23:35.528
MARISHA: You and
your frosty breath.

03:23:35.552 --> 03:23:37.196
LAURA: ♪ Naked Beau ♪

03:23:37.220 --> 03:23:38.738
♪ Naked Caleb ♪
TRAVIS: Scoop out of the dome.

03:23:38.762 --> 03:23:39.529
(explosion)

03:23:39.553 --> 03:23:40.528
LIAM: Anything?

03:23:40.552 --> 03:23:42.321
ASHLEY: Reach for the sky!
LIAM: Anything?

03:23:42.345 --> 03:23:45.196
Look at these two
skinny motherfuckers

03:23:45.220 --> 03:23:46.654
in the dome.
ASHLEY: Nothing?

03:23:46.678 --> 03:23:48.029
MARISHA: Okay.

03:23:48.053 --> 03:23:49.405
(laughter)

03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:51.528
TALIESIN: 23, do I see any eyes?

03:23:51.552 --> 03:23:52.528
MATT: No eyes on either of them.

03:23:52.552 --> 03:23:53.321
TALIESIN: No eyes!
MATT: Other than the ones

03:23:53.345 --> 03:23:54.280
that are already there.

03:23:54.304 --> 03:23:55.280
TALIESIN: No new eyes.

03:23:55.304 --> 03:23:56.345
Same old eyes.

03:23:58.220 --> 03:23:59.095
Eyes on the prize.

03:24:01.137 --> 03:24:02.321
LIAM: Okay.

03:24:02.345 --> 03:24:03.528
Early to bed, early to rise.

03:24:03.552 --> 03:24:06.012
Let's get to the outpost.
SAM: Are we flying more?

03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:08.928
LAURA: We could do
one final flight.

03:24:09.887 --> 03:24:11.528
LIAM: We probably-- well,

03:24:11.552 --> 03:24:12.529
let's see what the
weather is like.

03:24:12.553 --> 03:24:13.887
What's the weather like?

03:24:14.928 --> 03:24:18.528
MATT: Well, you'd have to
begin your journey to find out.

03:24:18.552 --> 03:24:20.321
Right now, it seems fine.

03:24:20.345 --> 03:24:21.528
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: There are still clouds

03:24:21.552 --> 03:24:23.595
in the sky, it's
not open, you know,

03:24:24.762 --> 03:24:26.988
cold, blue,
sun-reflected morning.

03:24:27.012 --> 03:24:28.528
It's still a little gray.

03:24:28.552 --> 03:24:29.654
LIAM: Well, I'll tell you
what, why don't we walk

03:24:29.678 --> 03:24:31.863
for 20 minutes and see what
the weather feels like?

03:24:31.887 --> 03:24:32.654
TRAVIS: I'm down with that.

03:24:32.678 --> 03:24:34.095
TALIESIN: That's a great idea.
LIAM: Make a plan from there.

03:24:35.053 --> 03:24:36.571
MATT: Gathering your
things, the dome vanishes.

03:24:36.595 --> 03:24:39.988
You all side-step the
elements of snow that have

03:24:40.012 --> 03:24:42.029
been pushed around,
that Caduceus arranged,

03:24:42.053 --> 03:24:44.821
but the dome-top is pretty
clean, so it's not a huge
danger.

03:24:44.845 --> 03:24:46.779
And, even so, overnight,
depending on the weather,

03:24:46.803 --> 03:24:49.137
it would igloo anyway, so.

03:24:49.928 --> 03:24:51.738
Which I did wrong previously,

03:24:51.762 --> 03:24:53.528
as the internet has let me know.

03:24:53.552 --> 03:24:55.447
(laughter)

03:24:55.471 --> 03:24:56.528
MATT: Eh.

03:24:56.552 --> 03:24:57.528
You were right, you were right.

03:24:57.552 --> 03:24:58.946
That's on me.

03:24:58.970 --> 03:25:00.738
But 20 minutes in the journey,

03:25:00.762 --> 03:25:03.220
I would like somebody to
roll a d20 for me, please.

03:25:04.762 --> 03:25:05.779
LAURA: Oh, we should all--
SAM: Me?

03:25:05.803 --> 03:25:06.946
Or are we all going to--

03:25:06.970 --> 03:25:09.488
LIAM: I'm going to hang out
of this one, because I was

03:25:09.512 --> 03:25:11.029
the big winner last time.
TRAVIS: Ready, and--

03:25:11.053 --> 03:25:13.779
SAM: Boulder, parchment, shears.

03:25:13.803 --> 03:25:15.196
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, no, wait!

03:25:15.220 --> 03:25:16.946
He's the only one
that did paper.

03:25:16.970 --> 03:25:18.612
MATT: Travis, you're the
only one that did paper.

03:25:18.636 --> 03:25:19.779
Parchment, sorry.

03:25:19.803 --> 03:25:21.595
TRAVIS: d20?
MATT: d20.

03:25:23.552 --> 03:25:24.529
TRAVIS: 19.

03:25:24.553 --> 03:25:25.821
TALIESIN: Aw, no.

03:25:25.845 --> 03:25:26.612
MATT: 19.

03:25:26.636 --> 03:25:28.280
LIAM: Tarrasque!
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:25:28.304 --> 03:25:29.738
(laughter)

03:25:29.762 --> 03:25:32.779
TRAVIS: Give it to me!

03:25:32.803 --> 03:25:34.321
LAURA: Oh no. TRAVIS:
Don't look at me like that.

03:25:34.345 --> 03:25:35.528
ASHLEY: He's got a face on.

03:25:35.552 --> 03:25:36.528
LAURA: No, that's the good one.

03:25:36.552 --> 03:25:37.946
19 is good.
TRAVIS: It's fine.

03:25:37.970 --> 03:25:39.447
LIAM: I want it.

03:25:39.471 --> 03:25:40.447
MATT: The weather is clear.

03:25:40.471 --> 03:25:43.488
(cheering)

03:25:43.512 --> 03:25:44.280
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:25:44.304 --> 03:25:47.738
MATT: Gray, but without
issue, no storms blowing,

03:25:47.762 --> 03:25:51.552
just a gentle journey eastward.

03:25:53.762 --> 03:25:55.488
Continuing on this path on foot,

03:25:55.512 --> 03:25:56.654
you could go and fly
if you'd like to,

03:25:56.678 --> 03:25:58.528
or continue on foot, your call.

03:25:58.552 --> 03:26:01.528
LIAM: Well, if we go up, we
could probably get a good look.

03:26:01.552 --> 03:26:02.863
LAURA: We could get a good look.
LIAM: And, know exactly where to
go.

03:26:02.887 --> 03:26:04.528
LAURA: And we could get there

03:26:04.552 --> 03:26:05.321
much faster--
TALIESIN: Save a spell.

03:26:05.345 --> 03:26:06.280
LAURA: -- because
it's not windy.

03:26:06.304 --> 03:26:07.095
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:26:08.552 --> 03:26:09.595
TALIESIN: Happy to save a spell.

03:26:11.636 --> 03:26:14.528
LAURA: I could do three of
us, we could get even faster,

03:26:14.552 --> 03:26:16.113
because we'll be going--

03:26:16.137 --> 03:26:16.904
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Yeah?

03:26:16.928 --> 03:26:18.363
LIAM: Yeah, repeat of yesterday.

03:26:18.387 --> 03:26:21.363
LAURA: Okay, let's
do three fliers.

03:26:21.387 --> 03:26:22.528
Eagles.
LIAM: (popping sound)

03:26:22.552 --> 03:26:23.429
MATT: All righty.

03:26:24.678 --> 03:26:26.612
(wings whooshing)

03:26:26.636 --> 03:26:30.529
You take off with the troop,
heading eastward, eyes peeled.

03:26:30.553 --> 03:26:35.654
I would like the eagles and
perhaps one additional member

03:26:35.678 --> 03:26:37.155
of the party to make
perception checks, please.

03:26:37.179 --> 03:26:38.528
LIAM: The eagles are coming!
MATT: There is no storm

03:26:38.552 --> 03:26:40.113
blocking your vision, so
you do have advantage.

03:26:40.137 --> 03:26:42.363
Go ahead and add your
perception roll for the eagles.

03:26:42.387 --> 03:26:43.155
If there isn't a--

03:26:43.179 --> 03:26:44.528
LAURA: So, we get
advantage on perception?

03:26:44.552 --> 03:26:45.571
MATT: You do.

03:26:45.595 --> 03:26:46.696
ASHLEY: Ooh!

03:26:46.720 --> 03:26:48.471
LAURA: Ooh!

03:26:50.012 --> 03:26:51.488
TALIESIN: 26.

03:26:51.512 --> 03:26:52.447
LAURA: 23.

03:26:52.471 --> 03:26:53.654
MATT: Nice.

03:26:53.678 --> 03:26:55.113
LIAM: Er-- uh.

03:26:55.137 --> 03:26:56.321
ASHLEY: 22.

03:26:56.345 --> 03:26:59.488
ALL: (record scratching)

03:26:59.512 --> 03:27:01.488
LIAM: 16.
MATT: All right.

03:27:01.512 --> 03:27:02.488
MARISHA: Ow-ah.
MATT: Ow-ah.

03:27:02.512 --> 03:27:04.552
ALL: Ow-ah.

03:27:05.595 --> 03:27:07.529
MATT: About an hour's
worth of travel in,

03:27:07.553 --> 03:27:10.095
you make a good bit of distance.

03:27:11.928 --> 03:27:14.528
You, Jester, and you,
Caduceus, can see,

03:27:14.552 --> 03:27:19.612
along the ridge of rock
and stone and ice shelves

03:27:19.636 --> 03:27:23.447
that mark where
this sinkhole begins

03:27:23.471 --> 03:27:25.113
and where the ruins themselves,

03:27:25.137 --> 03:27:28.321
at least sealed beneath
the layers of ice

03:27:28.345 --> 03:27:31.363
over a millennia at this point,

03:27:31.387 --> 03:27:33.321
ride and shift into
the topography,

03:27:33.345 --> 03:27:36.196
only in this high point of view

03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:37.738
can you really
make out the edges

03:27:37.762 --> 03:27:40.863
of where this ruin
sits in this valley.

03:27:40.887 --> 03:27:43.571
And both of you can make
out the familiar sight

03:27:43.595 --> 03:27:46.528
of that one cluster
of icy spires

03:27:46.552 --> 03:27:48.528
that you remember
the outpost is.

03:27:48.552 --> 03:27:49.612
You're not near it yet.

03:27:49.636 --> 03:27:52.904
You still have a better day's
worth of travel to get there.

03:27:52.928 --> 03:27:56.738
But you know the direction
you're going, without error.

03:27:56.762 --> 03:27:58.528
TALIESIN: And we can
carve a little bit

03:27:58.552 --> 03:27:59.988
of that time out
for the next hour.

03:28:00.012 --> 03:28:01.071
That'll help us get there.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:28:01.095 --> 03:28:02.528
That'll be good, right?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:28:02.552 --> 03:28:03.612
TALIESIN: All right.

03:28:03.636 --> 03:28:06.612
MATT: So continuing on this
path for the next hour,

03:28:06.636 --> 03:28:08.738
you come to a landing
as the spell fades,

03:28:08.762 --> 03:28:09.738
and you gather you probably have

03:28:09.762 --> 03:28:12.552
another four or five hours
on foot to get there.

03:28:13.762 --> 03:28:14.696
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: That's not bad.

03:28:14.720 --> 03:28:15.738
MARISHA: Not bad at all.

03:28:15.762 --> 03:28:16.528
TALIESIN: Fine with that.

03:28:16.552 --> 03:28:18.821
LAURA: Did we see
anything, like any other

03:28:18.845 --> 03:28:20.595
people walking while
we were flying?

03:28:21.636 --> 03:28:24.113
MATT: With your perception
view, you would've.

03:28:24.137 --> 03:28:25.387
You would've seen...

03:28:27.137 --> 03:28:27.928
Actually.

03:28:29.471 --> 03:28:30.528
Yeah.

03:28:30.552 --> 03:28:32.528
You would've seen one
small group of what looks

03:28:32.552 --> 03:28:36.946
to be four white-cloaked figures

03:28:36.970 --> 03:28:39.654
that are doing a journey,

03:28:39.678 --> 03:28:43.528
not leaving any footprints
behind, around the outer edge,

03:28:43.552 --> 03:28:46.238
heading away from
the outpost, and

03:28:46.262 --> 03:28:48.528
intersecting the path
you would be taking.

03:28:48.552 --> 03:28:49.528
TALIESIN: Does it look
like they're heading

03:28:49.552 --> 03:28:52.053
to where I know the
secret entrance to be?

03:28:53.471 --> 03:28:55.447
MATT: It looks like they're
following the perimeter

03:28:55.471 --> 03:28:57.988
of the ruin exterior.
TRAVIS: Patrol.

03:28:58.012 --> 03:28:58.863
TALIESIN: Just a patrol.
MATT: You get the sense

03:28:58.887 --> 03:29:00.636
it's likely one of
the outpost's patrols.

03:29:02.429 --> 03:29:03.946
But you land.

03:29:03.970 --> 03:29:05.571
Are you taking the rest of
this journey on foot, then?

03:29:05.595 --> 03:29:06.654
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Yeah?

03:29:06.678 --> 03:29:07.803
TALIESIN: I think so.
MATT: Okay.

03:29:09.304 --> 03:29:11.552
(sighs) Moving forward.

03:29:12.552 --> 03:29:15.988
You're a bit exhausted, but
you eventually make your way

03:29:16.012 --> 03:29:19.321
to that familiar
cluster of spires.

03:29:19.345 --> 03:29:23.196
Within moments,
you hear, "Halt!"

03:29:23.220 --> 03:29:25.863
And you see, coming
out of the nearby snow,

03:29:25.887 --> 03:29:28.196
(whooshing)

03:29:28.220 --> 03:29:30.529
approximately seven individuals,

03:29:30.553 --> 03:29:32.696
armed with all manner
of bows, crossbows,

03:29:32.720 --> 03:29:34.696
and even one with, it looks
to be some sort of a rifle.

03:29:34.720 --> 03:29:36.405
Like an elongated pistol.
TALIESIN: Ooh!

03:29:36.429 --> 03:29:37.678
LAURA: What?
TALIESIN: Oh, that's cool.

03:29:38.552 --> 03:29:39.571
SAM: They're Sand People.

03:29:39.595 --> 03:29:42.488
LIAM: I hold up my Little
Orphan Annie membership badge

03:29:42.512 --> 03:29:44.321
from the Dynasty.

03:29:44.345 --> 03:29:46.029
MATT: One of them
puts his bow down,

03:29:46.053 --> 03:29:49.196
still holding the
arrow in place,

03:29:49.220 --> 03:29:50.612
takes a few steps
forward, gets about

03:29:50.636 --> 03:29:52.387
20 feet from you to glance over.

03:29:53.552 --> 03:29:55.528
"Ah, we're expecting you."

03:29:55.552 --> 03:29:57.528
TALIESIN: I was hoping
he'd say that. MATT: "Come.

03:29:57.552 --> 03:29:59.528
"Essek is waiting."

03:29:59.552 --> 03:30:01.113
Puts his hand up, everyone
puts their weapons down

03:30:01.137 --> 03:30:04.196
at the ready, but they
keep watch out past you,

03:30:04.220 --> 03:30:06.528
just remaining keen on
the space to make sure

03:30:06.552 --> 03:30:08.405
no one's followed you or
there's any funny business,

03:30:08.429 --> 03:30:09.946
as you follow this
one individual

03:30:09.970 --> 03:30:13.113
that leads you back into
the center of the outpost.

03:30:13.137 --> 03:30:14.988
As you begin to approach, and
you can see this individual

03:30:15.012 --> 03:30:18.238
that's guiding you is,
you know, at this moment,

03:30:18.262 --> 03:30:21.071
putting on a bit of an air
and a hand up of, no worries.

03:30:21.095 --> 03:30:23.571
At that point, a little
bit of bustle continues

03:30:23.595 --> 03:30:27.528
between the central pathway.

03:30:27.552 --> 03:30:29.238
Of the various spires
here, there's a little

03:30:29.262 --> 03:30:31.528
carved road nook
between the center,

03:30:31.552 --> 03:30:34.363
where most of these structures
are built to face each other,

03:30:34.387 --> 03:30:36.612
so it can, for the
most part, do business

03:30:36.636 --> 03:30:39.678
back and forth, unseen by
the majority of the valley.

03:30:40.803 --> 03:30:44.280
You are led to the familiar
exterior of Essek's chambers.

03:30:44.304 --> 03:30:46.280
And, as you approach, the door

03:30:46.304 --> 03:30:48.571
(whooshing) opens on its own.

03:30:48.595 --> 03:30:51.863
You step inside and you
can see there, pacing back

03:30:51.887 --> 03:30:55.363
and forth, or would be pacing
if he wasn't floating--

03:30:55.387 --> 03:30:58.552
gliding back and
forth, Essek turns.

03:30:59.552 --> 03:31:03.471
"(relieved sigh)
Friends, please enter.

03:31:05.137 --> 03:31:06.720
"I've got it from
here, thank you."

03:31:08.552 --> 03:31:10.029
As you all enter, the
door closes behind,

03:31:10.053 --> 03:31:12.321
as he curls his
hand towards him.

03:31:12.345 --> 03:31:14.612
And, with his other
hand, he drifts out,

03:31:14.636 --> 03:31:17.612
a chair scooches forward and
he drifts down into the chair,

03:31:17.636 --> 03:31:19.720
one leg crossed over the other.

03:31:20.720 --> 03:31:22.552
"I'm glad you've
traveled here safely.

03:31:24.636 --> 03:31:26.220
"It is good to see your faces.

03:31:27.928 --> 03:31:28.720
"So,

03:31:29.762 --> 03:31:31.196
"what is the word?"

03:31:31.220 --> 03:31:34.904
LAURA: Are we in the chamber
that had the invisible guards

03:31:34.928 --> 03:31:37.654
or are we in his
private chambers?

03:31:37.678 --> 03:31:40.528
MATT: No, you are in the chamber
that has the invisible guards.

03:31:40.552 --> 03:31:43.155
TRAVIS: I'm going to walk up and
just place a hand on his
shoulder.

03:31:43.179 --> 03:31:45.529
It's good to see you as well.

03:31:45.553 --> 03:31:46.678
Is his shoulder his?

03:31:47.552 --> 03:31:49.095
LAURA: Mm.
MATT: Ah, it is.

03:31:50.552 --> 03:31:52.095
LIAM: May we speak freely here?

03:31:53.512 --> 03:31:54.553
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:31:55.553 --> 03:31:59.553
MATT: "Is there something
that should not be shared?"

03:32:03.552 --> 03:32:05.321
Any of you speak Undercommon?

03:32:05.345 --> 03:32:06.321
MARISHA: Yep.

03:32:06.345 --> 03:32:10.053
MATT: You hear Essek say,
"Give me 10 minutes, please."

03:32:12.636 --> 03:32:15.238
TRAVIS: Yep-- oh,
right, not to us.

03:32:15.262 --> 03:32:17.280
MATT: And you watch
as two perched guards

03:32:17.304 --> 03:32:19.113
step out of the shadows nearby,

03:32:19.137 --> 03:32:21.029
descend and exit the chamber.

03:32:21.053 --> 03:32:22.762
It closes, he waits a moment.

03:32:24.928 --> 03:32:26.220
"Now we can speak freely."

03:32:28.179 --> 03:32:30.029
LIAM: Well, things are
considerably more complicated

03:32:30.053 --> 03:32:32.220
than when we left
you, I'm afraid.

03:32:33.678 --> 03:32:35.636
MATT: "This is my
look of surprise.

03:32:37.429 --> 03:32:39.946
"Well, please explain
these complications to me."

03:32:39.970 --> 03:32:41.654
LIAM: So...
LAURA: Oh!

03:32:41.678 --> 03:32:43.612
LIAM: Yes?
LAURA: Oh, we have an extra...

03:32:43.636 --> 03:32:44.988
I'm going to pull out
the extra necklace.

03:32:45.012 --> 03:32:45.803
Put it on!

03:32:47.720 --> 03:32:50.321
This will keep you
from being scryed on.

03:32:50.345 --> 03:32:53.238
MATT: His eyes flash in a
familiar way that you've seen

03:32:53.262 --> 03:32:56.552
whenever Caleb has looked
over any sort of magical item.

03:32:57.845 --> 03:32:58.636
"Huh.

03:33:00.262 --> 03:33:01.447
"Wonderful, thank you."

03:33:01.471 --> 03:33:04.071
And he goes and places
it over his neck

03:33:04.095 --> 03:33:05.636
and tucks it within his mantle.

03:33:06.636 --> 03:33:08.528
"I'll get to that in a bit.

03:33:08.552 --> 03:33:09.405
"What else?"

03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:13.113
LIAM: Now that may be useful
in the days ahead of us.

03:33:13.137 --> 03:33:13.928
However,

03:33:16.304 --> 03:33:18.262
some damage may
already have been done.

03:33:21.762 --> 03:33:26.071
In an effort to hide
ourselves from the prying eyes

03:33:26.095 --> 03:33:29.405
of our adversary
here in Eiselcross,

03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:33.528
we traveled back to
some of our homeland

03:33:33.552 --> 03:33:38.552
and acquired quite a
few of those for us.

03:33:39.137 --> 03:33:40.447
We wanted to--

03:33:40.471 --> 03:33:41.821
LAURA: (whispered) Can you
look for invisible scrying?

03:33:41.845 --> 03:33:43.738
LIAM: -- take
ourselves off the grid.

03:33:43.762 --> 03:33:48.762
However, we had
run-ins with my folk.

03:33:50.928 --> 03:33:53.512
Ikithon and his protégés.

03:33:54.553 --> 03:33:57.363
(sighing)

03:33:57.387 --> 03:34:00.179
So we risked much to get these,

03:34:01.179 --> 03:34:06.179
but in doing so, there
was a confrontation.

03:34:08.345 --> 03:34:11.528
And I am fairly certain,

03:34:11.552 --> 03:34:13.552
because of his past
dealings with you,

03:34:15.137 --> 03:34:20.137
and my use of things I
have learned with you

03:34:20.512 --> 03:34:23.429
and from my own noodling,

03:34:24.387 --> 03:34:26.552
that he has put two
and two together and...

03:34:32.552 --> 03:34:37.071
I'm sorry, Essek, I think that
he may have got wise to you,

03:34:37.095 --> 03:34:39.928
so there is a very real
chance that he has been--

03:34:41.053 --> 03:34:44.113
TRAVIS: On that note, summon the
sword, cast See Invisibility.

03:34:44.137 --> 03:34:45.304
LIAM: -- watching you already.

03:34:46.803 --> 03:34:48.553
MATT: Make a perception
check for me.

03:34:51.387 --> 03:34:52.488
TRAVIS: 19.

03:34:52.512 --> 03:34:53.280
MATT: 19.

03:34:53.304 --> 03:34:54.678
Looking throughout the chamber,

03:34:55.887 --> 03:34:57.528
you feel pretty
safe at the moment.

03:34:57.552 --> 03:35:01.238
TRAVIS: Those prying eyes are
at least not here at the moment.

03:35:01.262 --> 03:35:02.262
LIAM: Not at the moment.

03:35:03.552 --> 03:35:04.363
So what does that mean?

03:35:04.387 --> 03:35:07.528
That means we are still
on a ticking clock.

03:35:07.552 --> 03:35:09.012
We still need to keep moving.

03:35:10.552 --> 03:35:13.528
We would still be very
grateful for your aid,

03:35:13.552 --> 03:35:14.887
if you wish to give it to us.

03:35:16.137 --> 03:35:17.552
But we have to assume

03:35:20.220 --> 03:35:24.220
Trent and his closest,

03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:29.387
they could be showing up soon.

03:35:30.552 --> 03:35:34.552
And we had the prickly idea,

03:35:36.471 --> 03:35:39.095
since we are facing something so

03:35:40.970 --> 03:35:44.528
large and potentially
beyond all of us, even you,

03:35:44.552 --> 03:35:47.720
that in these circumstances,

03:35:50.762 --> 03:35:53.304
perhaps we should be
negotiating an alliance.

03:35:56.552 --> 03:35:57.821
(laughter)

03:35:57.845 --> 03:35:59.988
LAURA: A temporary one.

03:36:00.012 --> 03:36:00.803
You know?

03:36:02.552 --> 03:36:04.179
TALIESIN: It does solve
a couple problems.

03:36:05.512 --> 03:36:08.238
If he's involved, then it's
not just you working with him,

03:36:08.262 --> 03:36:09.321
it's him working with you.

03:36:09.345 --> 03:36:12.821
It muddies the water
for any information

03:36:12.845 --> 03:36:15.012
he feels the need to spill.

03:36:16.095 --> 03:36:18.238
Do we have those crystals?

03:36:18.262 --> 03:36:19.970
MATT: "I do wish
it was that simple.

03:36:21.552 --> 03:36:25.137
"I mean, I've been expecting my

03:36:26.471 --> 03:36:28.528
"choices to catch up to me.

03:36:28.552 --> 03:36:32.552
"Maybe not as soon as
I had hoped, but...

03:36:34.137 --> 03:36:34.970
"As this is.

03:36:39.053 --> 03:36:42.528
"Regardless, it is not safe for
me to remain in this outpost.

03:36:42.552 --> 03:36:45.553
"My presence here puts
everyone else in danger.

03:36:48.095 --> 03:36:49.304
"Let alone myself.

03:36:51.220 --> 03:36:56.012
"As this is not an unknown
location, at least its
existence.

03:37:01.552 --> 03:37:03.738
"It would be safe for me to
travel with you into this ruin,

03:37:03.762 --> 03:37:05.552
"which I was preparing for.

03:37:08.552 --> 03:37:09.387
"I

03:37:11.053 --> 03:37:13.387
"do not trust

03:37:16.552 --> 03:37:17.803
"working with that man."

03:37:19.304 --> 03:37:20.528
LIAM: No.

03:37:20.552 --> 03:37:22.553
MATT: "I understand
if you need to,

03:37:24.179 --> 03:37:27.363
"but I do not think that
I could be part of that."

03:37:27.387 --> 03:37:28.471
MARISHA: Oh, wow.

03:37:30.552 --> 03:37:31.696
MATT: "I can find a place to go.

03:37:31.720 --> 03:37:35.720
"I am capable of being
slippery when I need to be.

03:37:40.471 --> 03:37:44.387
"And I understand
if you find the

03:37:45.762 --> 03:37:49.528
"capabilities of a member
of the Assembly more useful,

03:37:49.552 --> 03:37:54.552
"given the dangers you face,
and the choice is yours."

03:37:56.095 --> 03:37:56.887
LIAM: Essek.

03:37:58.552 --> 03:38:00.552
We don't trust him either.

03:38:02.220 --> 03:38:07.220
The question is,
one, do you trust us?

03:38:08.928 --> 03:38:09.720
And, two,

03:38:12.762 --> 03:38:16.612
what we are talking
about could potentially

03:38:16.636 --> 03:38:21.262
leave your home
and mine in ashes.

03:38:24.512 --> 03:38:26.179
You've committed
sins in your home.

03:38:28.552 --> 03:38:29.471
So have I.

03:38:31.887 --> 03:38:35.803
You talked about wanting
to make up for them.

03:38:41.552 --> 03:38:46.488
If the appropriate amount
of ability and skill

03:38:46.512 --> 03:38:49.552
is not wrought
against this enemy,

03:38:51.552 --> 03:38:55.552
it could spread across every
inch of the world we know.

03:38:58.512 --> 03:39:00.387
I understand this
is unpalatable.

03:39:01.552 --> 03:39:03.262
My question to you

03:39:06.012 --> 03:39:07.845
is do you want to
protect your home?

03:39:11.970 --> 03:39:12.928
MATT: He leans back.

03:39:18.552 --> 03:39:20.387
"I do, but I do not...

03:39:25.678 --> 03:39:28.137
"I do not think you seek
the right kind of aid.

03:39:31.095 --> 03:39:32.471
"Not with this man.

03:39:36.552 --> 03:39:40.988
"You mentioned that
one of the Assembly

03:39:41.012 --> 03:39:44.845
"already fell under the spell
of whatever this thing is.

03:39:46.387 --> 03:39:47.405
"Right?

03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:49.988
"This Cognouza."

03:39:50.012 --> 03:39:50.928
LIAM: True.

03:39:54.262 --> 03:39:57.595
MATT: "Then why should
someone as entrenched,

03:39:59.012 --> 03:40:02.887
"as selfish and as
dubious as Ikithon

03:40:05.552 --> 03:40:08.512
"not wait 'til the right moment
and take it for himself?"

03:40:13.512 --> 03:40:15.053
LIAM: He may very well do so.

03:40:16.762 --> 03:40:18.612
And we are prepared
to deal with that.

03:40:18.636 --> 03:40:19.845
MATT: "Are you?"

03:40:21.304 --> 03:40:22.095
LIAM: Yeah.

03:40:24.262 --> 03:40:26.053
And your judgment of him...

03:40:28.636 --> 03:40:29.970
Yes, he is corrupt.

03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:38.053
You and I know
temptation is very real.

03:40:41.345 --> 03:40:43.528
And your estimation
of us is very good,

03:40:43.552 --> 03:40:46.696
but it is not as perfect
as you think it is.

03:40:46.720 --> 03:40:50.571
And I pull off my coat

03:40:50.595 --> 03:40:53.113
and pull clothes down--
LAURA: (gasps)

03:40:53.137 --> 03:40:55.595
LIAM: -- and show him the
eye on my right shoulder.

03:40:58.845 --> 03:41:01.946
MATT: His eyes narrow as he
looks and peers towards it

03:41:01.970 --> 03:41:04.528
with a curiosity and a worry.

03:41:04.552 --> 03:41:06.821
His brow furrows immediately.

03:41:06.845 --> 03:41:08.238
LAURA: Tell him it
wasn't on purpose.

03:41:08.262 --> 03:41:09.696
TALIESIN: I want
to check one thing.

03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:12.654
Is there even a
hint of recognition?

03:41:12.678 --> 03:41:13.528
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:41:13.552 --> 03:41:14.988
Or, sorry, an insight check.

03:41:15.012 --> 03:41:15.803
MARISHA: Good question.

03:41:17.970 --> 03:41:19.571
TALIESIN: Fucking insight.

03:41:19.595 --> 03:41:21.053
Oh, good, 24.

03:41:22.471 --> 03:41:23.262
MATT: 24.

03:41:26.345 --> 03:41:29.238
Recognition wouldn't
be what I'd say.

03:41:29.262 --> 03:41:34.262
Just unexpected processing.

03:41:34.552 --> 03:41:36.528
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:41:36.552 --> 03:41:38.595
LIAM: Fjord, are we
still good in here?

03:41:40.012 --> 03:41:41.113
TRAVIS: Anything new?

03:41:41.137 --> 03:41:41.928
Good.

03:41:46.179 --> 03:41:47.552
LIAM: I propose a side venture,

03:41:50.552 --> 03:41:52.012
in the middle of all of this,

03:41:53.762 --> 03:41:57.678
is to rid this
world of that man.

03:42:00.552 --> 03:42:02.137
As circumstance provides.

03:42:09.304 --> 03:42:10.429
MATT: "So, this

03:42:12.845 --> 03:42:15.636
"alliance you promote

03:42:18.512 --> 03:42:20.512
"is intended to be
a trap for him?"

03:42:22.552 --> 03:42:23.512
LIAM: It's a perk.

03:42:27.636 --> 03:42:30.612
If we fail in the coming days,

03:42:30.636 --> 03:42:33.552
none of this even matters,
this conversation we're having.

03:42:35.012 --> 03:42:39.528
If we succeed, both
our homes still have

03:42:39.552 --> 03:42:42.552
their struggles with each other,
their faults, their flaws.

03:42:44.970 --> 03:42:46.887
And he is a flaw from our home.

03:42:50.552 --> 03:42:51.762
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:42:53.552 --> 03:42:54.429
TRAVIS: Big one.

03:42:57.636 --> 03:42:58.654
SAM: That dice!

03:42:58.678 --> 03:42:59.528
That dice!
TRAVIS: Meteorite?

03:42:59.552 --> 03:43:00.612
Meteorite?
LAURA: It failed you?

03:43:00.636 --> 03:43:02.321
It betrayed you in
this vital moment?

03:43:02.345 --> 03:43:03.803
LIAM: It super betrayed.

03:43:04.803 --> 03:43:06.071
MARISHA: What?

03:43:06.095 --> 03:43:07.595
SAM: One.
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:43:08.595 --> 03:43:09.779
Wow.
MARISHA: Shit.

03:43:09.803 --> 03:43:11.029
TRAVIS: It is real.

03:43:11.053 --> 03:43:13.262
SAM: (sighs) Wow.

03:43:14.220 --> 03:43:16.779
MATT: Essek thinks it over
for a minute in quiet silence.

03:43:16.803 --> 03:43:18.528
MARISHA: Wow.

03:43:18.552 --> 03:43:20.053
TRAVIS: Good squeeze.
SAM: Burn it.

03:43:23.552 --> 03:43:25.696
MATT: "I understand
what you are proposing,

03:43:25.720 --> 03:43:28.552
"and I see the
logic in it, I do.

03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:34.845
"But if I am to be honest,

03:43:36.845 --> 03:43:39.262
"I am jealous

03:43:42.304 --> 03:43:46.528
"of the bravery and confidence
you have in such things.

03:43:46.552 --> 03:43:48.678
"I am still a coward."

03:43:52.387 --> 03:43:53.528
LIAM: A coward?

03:43:53.552 --> 03:43:55.779
You have dared much.

03:43:55.803 --> 03:43:59.471
MATT: "I have done
everything for myself.

03:44:00.762 --> 03:44:02.528
"And when any of
it came to bear,

03:44:02.552 --> 03:44:05.552
"I have done everything
I can to hide and flee.

03:44:10.970 --> 03:44:14.528
"I am more than happy
to go and put my life

03:44:14.552 --> 03:44:16.762
"on the line for this cause,

03:44:22.636 --> 03:44:25.970
"but there is something
about that man

03:44:27.552 --> 03:44:31.552
"and what he could bring
upon me and those he...

03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:39.053
"He may very well
be coming anyway.

03:44:40.137 --> 03:44:41.803
"But if you want
to work with him,

03:44:43.762 --> 03:44:46.405
"I may have to
work independently.

03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:47.304
"Maybe follow.

03:44:48.553 --> 03:44:50.363
"I fear I would
make this messier

03:44:50.387 --> 03:44:52.528
"than you need to make it work.

03:44:52.552 --> 03:44:53.678
"Does that make sense?

03:44:56.053 --> 03:44:56.887
"I just...

03:45:00.552 --> 03:45:03.179
"I'm not saying I
leave you alone, but

03:45:06.803 --> 03:45:09.238
"we would have to
work separately."

03:45:09.262 --> 03:45:10.552
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

03:45:11.552 --> 03:45:13.196
Of course, it makes sense.

03:45:13.220 --> 03:45:15.155
There is no good
answer to any of this.

03:45:15.179 --> 03:45:16.528
TALIESIN: Absolutely not.

03:45:16.552 --> 03:45:18.988
TRAVIS: We don't want you
to be uneasy or unsettled.

03:45:19.012 --> 03:45:20.678
There'll be plenty
of that to come.

03:45:22.095 --> 03:45:23.528
You must understand
that we are trying

03:45:23.552 --> 03:45:26.528
to gather every able hand and--

03:45:26.552 --> 03:45:27.552
MATT: "Of course.

03:45:28.595 --> 03:45:29.970
"I see the import of that.

03:45:31.137 --> 03:45:34.053
"I just know that I've
also survived this long,

03:45:35.552 --> 03:45:40.528
"weaving the intricacies
of deceit like I have,

03:45:40.552 --> 03:45:44.345
"by knowing how
best to keep myself

03:45:46.137 --> 03:45:48.678
"out of the complications
as best as I can."

03:45:51.552 --> 03:45:53.779
MATT: "If you wish to
work with him directly,

03:45:53.803 --> 03:45:55.488
"I will not stop you.

03:45:55.512 --> 03:45:57.904
"And I will help
where I can, but

03:45:57.928 --> 03:46:00.553
"it may be at a distance."

03:46:03.095 --> 03:46:04.528
MARISHA: Maybe he's got a point.

03:46:04.552 --> 03:46:07.612
Maybe Trent is more complicated
than what it's worth

03:46:07.636 --> 03:46:09.488
across the board.
LIAM: We have a choice to make.

03:46:09.512 --> 03:46:10.528
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:46:10.552 --> 03:46:15.238
LIAM: Because Trent brings
power and probably numbers,

03:46:15.262 --> 03:46:18.779
but of course he is
untrustworthy, we all know that.

03:46:18.803 --> 03:46:20.863
TALIESIN: Is there a way
to find out if he actually

03:46:20.887 --> 03:46:24.595
is following us here, if
he knows where we are?

03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:27.363
If we can find out if
he's coming anyway,

03:46:27.387 --> 03:46:30.113
that certainly
changes the territory.

03:46:30.137 --> 03:46:32.904
LAURA: I could send
a message to Astrid.

03:46:32.928 --> 03:46:35.053
Tell her to cough if
they're following us.

03:46:37.552 --> 03:46:39.762
TALIESIN: Oh, also I
have a strange request.

03:46:41.012 --> 03:46:43.552
Would you mind terribly,
taking off your shirt?

03:46:45.179 --> 03:46:46.528
MATT: "Excuse me?"

03:46:46.552 --> 03:46:47.387
TALIESIN: Well,

03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:49.345
what's the word?

03:46:50.304 --> 03:46:52.363
Gotten a bit paranoid

03:46:52.387 --> 03:46:55.863
and I'd like to make
sure that there's

03:46:55.887 --> 03:46:57.528
the correct number of
eyeballs in this room,

03:46:57.552 --> 03:46:58.528
if you know what I mean.

03:46:58.552 --> 03:46:59.970
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:47:01.304 --> 03:47:02.928
TRAVIS: It's your strong suit.
MATT: (laughs)

03:47:03.928 --> 03:47:05.238
LAURA: I'll give him
an advantage and say,

03:47:05.262 --> 03:47:07.612
"Essek, if you take
your shirt off,

03:47:07.636 --> 03:47:08.946
all of us will."

03:47:08.970 --> 03:47:10.528
TALIESIN: 21.
LAURA: So you feel safe

03:47:10.552 --> 03:47:11.571
and comfortable.

03:47:11.595 --> 03:47:14.946
MARISHA: I will help that
by taking off my glove.

03:47:14.970 --> 03:47:16.528
Showing the back of my hand.

03:47:16.552 --> 03:47:18.321
SAM: I've already
taken off my shirt.

03:47:18.345 --> 03:47:21.071
(laughter)

03:47:21.095 --> 03:47:22.071
TRAVIS: No!

03:47:22.095 --> 03:47:23.552
MATT: Essek is very, like--

03:47:24.552 --> 03:47:26.863
TRAVIS: No!
MARISHA: Tig 'ol biddies.

03:47:26.887 --> 03:47:30.488
MATT: "If it puts you at ease,"
and you watch as he unsnaps

03:47:30.512 --> 03:47:32.529
some of the fasteners
for his mantle and--

03:47:32.553 --> 03:47:34.904
LAURA: He's got just a
rippy stripper outfit

03:47:34.928 --> 03:47:36.696
and it's just like--
(loud tearing)

03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:39.988
MATT: Dunamancy!
(laughter)

03:47:40.012 --> 03:47:41.528
LIAM: Sparkle and stars.

03:47:41.552 --> 03:47:44.238
TRAVIS: ♪ Janie's got a gun ♪
(laughter)

03:47:44.262 --> 03:47:46.405
TALIESIN: A giant chest tattoo.
MATT: Full on Kill-La-Kills it,

03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:47.220
I love it.

03:47:48.762 --> 03:47:50.529
No, he takes his mantle off

03:47:50.553 --> 03:47:53.363
and pulls the sides of the
robe away and you can see

03:47:53.387 --> 03:47:56.280
he has an undershirt, it's a
little sleeveless undershirt,

03:47:56.304 --> 03:47:59.155
of like a darker gray silk.

03:47:59.179 --> 03:48:00.095
And he

03:48:01.053 --> 03:48:04.262
begins to show his arms
and reveal-- he's--

03:48:05.053 --> 03:48:07.071
he's being modest with it,

03:48:07.095 --> 03:48:09.113
doing it in places
so he's not just

03:48:09.137 --> 03:48:10.529
full on

03:48:10.553 --> 03:48:12.528
bearing it all here,
but he's giving

03:48:12.552 --> 03:48:14.528
a fairly thorough glance.

03:48:14.552 --> 03:48:16.779
TALIESIN: Back and
head is a big one, too.

03:48:16.803 --> 03:48:19.280
MATT: He drops it in the
back a bit and shows,

03:48:19.304 --> 03:48:20.321
his hair's pretty
short in the back

03:48:20.345 --> 03:48:22.071
so it's pretty easy to see.

03:48:22.095 --> 03:48:23.654
TALIESIN: I appreciate that.

03:48:23.678 --> 03:48:24.528
MATT: "Of course. I understand."

03:48:24.552 --> 03:48:26.696
LAURA: We all
appreciate that, Essek.

03:48:26.720 --> 03:48:29.137
TALIESIN: This thing we're
learning to do every day.

03:48:31.345 --> 03:48:33.012
MATT: Fastens the
mantle back on.

03:48:34.137 --> 03:48:36.738
TRAVIS: Well, we should prepare
to at least explore the ruins

03:48:36.762 --> 03:48:39.029
shortly, we do have
a decision to make on

03:48:39.053 --> 03:48:40.363
our end.
MATT: "Of course.

03:48:40.387 --> 03:48:42.779
"Do as you need to do to
feel certain in your choices.

03:48:42.803 --> 03:48:44.029
"Let me know one
way or the other.

03:48:44.053 --> 03:48:46.904
"I will aid you however
I can regardless.

03:48:46.928 --> 03:48:50.528
"It will just inform how close."

03:48:50.552 --> 03:48:53.845
LIAM: If we forego trying
to negotiate with him,

03:48:54.762 --> 03:48:55.904
will you come with us?

03:48:55.928 --> 03:48:58.447
MATT: "Of course, I
was preparing to."

03:48:58.471 --> 03:48:59.238
LIAM: Okay.

03:48:59.262 --> 03:49:02.528
SAM: And is Dagen still around?

03:49:02.552 --> 03:49:05.988
(laughter)

03:49:06.012 --> 03:49:08.528
MATT: "Dagen, along with a
number of guards, have been sent

03:49:08.552 --> 03:49:11.528
"to watch the outskirts of the
entrance you had mentioned."

03:49:11.552 --> 03:49:12.447
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:49:12.471 --> 03:49:15.155
SAM: That's how
girls do it, right?

03:49:15.179 --> 03:49:18.488
ASHLEY: They just roll
it right in. (laughter)

03:49:18.512 --> 03:49:23.512
(laughter)

03:49:23.636 --> 03:49:26.155
SAM: I think that's
how it works.

03:49:26.179 --> 03:49:28.738
(laughter)

03:49:28.762 --> 03:49:33.720
SAM: (clicking noise)
(laughter)

03:49:36.471 --> 03:49:39.738
MATT: "I would however,
ask some semblance of haste

03:49:39.762 --> 03:49:42.321
"because these circumstances
do put a timeline

03:49:42.345 --> 03:49:45.528
"that's beyond just the
individual we are racing.

03:49:45.552 --> 03:49:49.113
"But the knowledge that

03:49:49.137 --> 03:49:50.387
"Master Ikithon has,

03:49:51.552 --> 03:49:52.528
"I'll be here if you need me,

03:49:52.552 --> 03:49:55.488
"I'm going to begin to
prepare for a journey

03:49:55.512 --> 03:49:56.280
"either way."

03:49:56.304 --> 03:49:57.612
LAURA: Spend some time with--
LIAM: Spend some time, yeah,

03:49:57.636 --> 03:49:58.696
with the--

03:49:58.720 --> 03:50:00.488
MATT: "Yes, I will
do that as well.

03:50:00.512 --> 03:50:02.238
"Thank you."
TALIESIN: That'll help a lot.

03:50:02.262 --> 03:50:03.904
MATT: "Thank you."

03:50:03.928 --> 03:50:06.488
MARISHA: Can we stay
here for a little bit?

03:50:06.512 --> 03:50:08.071
Just finish our conversation?

03:50:08.095 --> 03:50:09.779
MATT: "Certainly. Of course."

03:50:09.803 --> 03:50:12.488
And he drifts out
of his chair and

03:50:12.512 --> 03:50:14.363
glides around and
through the door

03:50:14.387 --> 03:50:17.696
and leaves you to your
devices in the room.

03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:20.405
LAURA: Man, Caleb, why didn't
you do a better job convincing
him?

03:50:20.429 --> 03:50:25.238
TRAVIS: Oh, that was a great
job, Jester, you did fantastic.

03:50:25.262 --> 03:50:27.304
LAURA: You did a good job.

03:50:28.553 --> 03:50:29.696
(laughs)

03:50:29.720 --> 03:50:31.528
MARISHA: It's a tough ultimatum.

03:50:31.552 --> 03:50:33.405
TRAVIS: Although it's
pretty simple though, right?

03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:35.363
LIAM: Happens.
SAM: Simple...?

03:50:35.387 --> 03:50:38.528
We're choosing between Essek
and Icky? LIAM: Fuckin' dice.

03:50:38.552 --> 03:50:41.196
TRAVIS: Yeah, we get
one dedicated ally

03:50:41.220 --> 03:50:42.612
that we know doesn't
want the thing

03:50:42.636 --> 03:50:44.488
that we're trying to keep
out of the hands of Lucien,

03:50:44.512 --> 03:50:46.113
and then on the
other side, we get

03:50:46.137 --> 03:50:49.113
more hands, but
perhaps more power,

03:50:49.137 --> 03:50:52.447
but an almost certainty
that they will try and keep

03:50:52.471 --> 03:50:55.447
whatever they prevent Lucien
from doing for themselves.

03:50:55.471 --> 03:50:57.863
LAURA: Yeah, which means we're
left fighting them at end.

03:50:57.887 --> 03:50:59.571
MARISHA: Yeah, the last
thing that we need is for

03:50:59.595 --> 03:51:03.528
some double crossing,
other complication.

03:51:03.552 --> 03:51:06.280
LIAM: I'm frustrated, I feel
like we could have worked it,

03:51:06.304 --> 03:51:09.528
but one person that we can trust

03:51:09.552 --> 03:51:11.321
is better than three
that we cannot.

03:51:11.345 --> 03:51:12.571
LAURA: I agree.
TRAVIS: Agree.

03:51:12.595 --> 03:51:15.571
LAURA: They could turn on us
in the middle of the fight.

03:51:15.595 --> 03:51:17.552
SAM: Can we at least
reach out to Astrid?

03:51:18.552 --> 03:51:20.029
LAURA: Find out if
they're following us?

03:51:20.053 --> 03:51:23.029
SAM: Well yes, and ask if
maybe she could tear away?

03:51:23.053 --> 03:51:23.845
I don't know.

03:51:25.595 --> 03:51:29.238
TRAVIS: Yeah, the key to the
volstruckers would be that
unless

03:51:29.262 --> 03:51:32.488
Trent is dead, they're still
going to fight on his side.

03:51:32.512 --> 03:51:35.196
If we could fell him, then
perhaps they would turn.

03:51:35.220 --> 03:51:36.571
But that's a big "if."

03:51:36.595 --> 03:51:39.262
And until then, the tide
would not be in our favor.

03:51:42.304 --> 03:51:44.488
We should check in with Astrid.

03:51:44.512 --> 03:51:46.779
LIAM: We could, we
need to be vague.

03:51:46.803 --> 03:51:47.946
If they know where we are,

03:51:47.970 --> 03:51:49.762
if they know where
Essek is, they do.

03:51:51.678 --> 03:51:53.970
But just in case, keep it vague.

03:51:54.887 --> 03:51:56.095
Maybe ask her...

03:51:57.762 --> 03:51:59.528
are they following?

03:51:59.552 --> 03:52:01.654
TALIESIN: And where
they think we are.

03:52:01.678 --> 03:52:05.321
LAURA: If she's around him,
she won't be able to answer.

03:52:05.345 --> 03:52:06.552
So we'll have to give her, like,

03:52:09.553 --> 03:52:11.552
you know, like cough.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:52:14.512 --> 03:52:15.654
LAURA: I've got to figure
it out because otherwise

03:52:15.678 --> 03:52:18.363
it's going to be very confusing.

03:52:18.387 --> 03:52:21.528
TALIESIN: We did try and throw
him off the path a while ago.

03:52:21.552 --> 03:52:23.447
SAM: Cough four times
if they're following us.

03:52:23.471 --> 03:52:24.238
LAURA: Exactly.

03:52:24.262 --> 03:52:25.779
Cough once if you're following,

03:52:25.803 --> 03:52:27.528
twice if you're not following,

03:52:27.552 --> 03:52:30.528
three times if you
know where we are.

03:52:30.552 --> 03:52:31.738
TRAVIS: Nope, that's
the same as one.

03:52:31.762 --> 03:52:33.029
LIAM: Yeah.

03:52:33.053 --> 03:52:35.654
Just cough--
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:52:35.678 --> 03:52:38.071
LIAM: -- cough if
you are on our tail

03:52:38.095 --> 03:52:40.779
and don't cough if you are not.

03:52:40.803 --> 03:52:43.471
MARISHA: But then how will we
know if she got the message?

03:52:44.552 --> 03:52:47.155
Maybe it should be a
cough and a sneeze?

03:52:47.179 --> 03:52:49.552
SAM: Or a throat clear? MARISHA:
Oh yeah, a throat clear.

03:52:50.845 --> 03:52:53.280
LAURA: Yeah, give
a-- (fake coughs)

03:52:53.304 --> 03:52:55.779
if they're following us and just

03:52:55.803 --> 03:52:57.612
(sniffs) if they're not.

03:52:57.636 --> 03:52:59.488
MARISHA: I like that.
That's not bad. LAURA: Okay.

03:52:59.512 --> 03:53:02.512
SAM: Wait, before you do this,
just to throw them off our tail,

03:53:03.552 --> 03:53:05.696
Caduceus, you can do
Thaumaturgy, right?

03:53:05.720 --> 03:53:06.528
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:53:06.552 --> 03:53:10.155
SAM: Maybe you could make it
sound like seagulls are
happening behind her.

03:53:10.179 --> 03:53:11.321
LAURA: I don't know
if that transfers.

03:53:11.345 --> 03:53:13.528
I don't think it
sends my environment.

03:53:13.552 --> 03:53:15.988
I think it's just my voice.

03:53:16.012 --> 03:53:17.528
(laughter)

03:53:17.552 --> 03:53:19.528
ASHLEY: You can still do it in
the background. TRAVIS: It's a
foley.

03:53:19.552 --> 03:53:21.988
We can make some
cobblestones and maybe some

03:53:22.012 --> 03:53:23.571
street vendors.

03:53:23.595 --> 03:53:25.528
SAM: Oh yeah, we can
do some call-out.

03:53:25.552 --> 03:53:28.779
TRAVIS: "Hey, getcha--"
SAM: (indistinct yelling)

03:53:28.803 --> 03:53:29.612
MATT: Oh my god.

03:53:29.636 --> 03:53:31.528
TALIESIN: Can you walk
around in a circle.

03:53:31.552 --> 03:53:33.528
SAM: -- for sale!
TALIESIN: Everybody--

03:53:33.552 --> 03:53:34.552
ASHLEY: I like that idea.

03:53:35.887 --> 03:53:38.612
LAURA: I don't need any
more distractions, please.

03:53:38.636 --> 03:53:40.528
(laughter)

03:53:40.552 --> 03:53:41.696
SAM: "Haberdasher!

03:53:41.720 --> 03:53:44.488
"Haberdasher over here!"
TRAVIS: "Seventh day,

03:53:44.512 --> 03:53:45.779
"seventh center of the world!"

03:53:45.803 --> 03:53:48.196
MATT: "Well struck, my lord!"
LIAM: "Huzzah to the victor!"

03:53:48.220 --> 03:53:49.946
(laughter)

03:53:49.970 --> 03:53:51.528
TALIESIN: Do you even remember
what we're supposed to say?

03:53:51.552 --> 03:53:53.238
LAURA: No. Okay, let's do it.

03:53:53.262 --> 03:53:54.363
MATT: Twice in one
episode, hell yeah.

03:53:54.387 --> 03:53:57.405
LIAM: We're in Trostenwald.
LAURA: Okay.

03:53:57.429 --> 03:53:59.528
TRAVIS: You do you. TALIESIN:
Where did we throw them off to?

03:53:59.552 --> 03:54:01.238
SAM: (tongue horse trot noises)

03:54:01.262 --> 03:54:03.528
LAURA: I'm going
to send a message

03:54:03.552 --> 03:54:05.429
to Astrid.
MATT: Okay.

03:54:07.552 --> 03:54:08.595
LAURA: (whispering) It's me.

03:54:11.345 --> 03:54:12.113
Jester.

03:54:12.137 --> 03:54:16.738
(laughter)

03:54:16.762 --> 03:54:17.988
Hey,

03:54:18.012 --> 03:54:20.552
I don't know if you're alone--
SAM: Oh, jesus.

03:54:21.553 --> 03:54:24.304
LAURA: -- if you're not,

03:54:27.595 --> 03:54:30.696
(laughing) and
you're following us--

03:54:30.720 --> 03:54:34.863
(laughter)
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:54:34.887 --> 03:54:39.612
(laughter)

03:54:39.636 --> 03:54:42.528
(laughter)

03:54:42.552 --> 03:54:45.528
(laughter)

03:54:45.552 --> 03:54:46.488
ASHLEY: Great start.

03:54:46.512 --> 03:54:47.571
TALIESIN: Oh, you did it.

03:54:47.595 --> 03:54:49.071
(laughter)

03:54:49.095 --> 03:54:52.238
SAM: "If you're not <i>and</i>
you're following us"?

03:54:52.262 --> 03:54:57.071
(laughter)

03:54:57.095 --> 03:55:00.779
(laughter)

03:55:00.803 --> 03:55:02.904
LAURA: Clear your throat

03:55:02.928 --> 03:55:05.029
if you're not following us.

03:55:05.053 --> 03:55:08.528
(laughter)

03:55:08.552 --> 03:55:11.238
LIAM: Clear your throat if
you're not following us?

03:55:11.262 --> 03:55:13.321
LAURA: Clear your throat
if you aren't following us

03:55:13.345 --> 03:55:14.552
is what I said.

03:55:17.179 --> 03:55:19.155
MARISHA: I really
hope she's alone.

03:55:19.179 --> 03:55:20.946
(laughter)

03:55:20.970 --> 03:55:25.845
LIAM: Caleb's like--
(laughter)

03:55:26.845 --> 03:55:27.904
TRAVIS: (buzzing)

03:55:27.928 --> 03:55:30.113
(crash)

03:55:30.137 --> 03:55:32.636
MATT: There's a pause.

03:55:36.304 --> 03:55:39.053
"I'm so very confused."

03:55:39.970 --> 03:55:41.053
LAURA: She's alone.

03:55:41.928 --> 03:55:43.345
LIAM: Round two.
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:55:46.552 --> 03:55:50.528
MATT: "What did you say?"
MARISHA: Oh no!

03:55:50.552 --> 03:55:55.363
(laughter)

03:55:55.387 --> 03:55:58.196
(laughter)

03:55:58.220 --> 03:55:59.363
LAURA: She's alone.

03:55:59.387 --> 03:56:01.053
I'll send her another message.

03:56:03.803 --> 03:56:06.528
TRAVIS: That hurt my forehead.

03:56:06.552 --> 03:56:10.471
Popped a vein between
my skull and my skin.

03:56:11.970 --> 03:56:13.012
LAURA: Sorry.

03:56:15.720 --> 03:56:18.552
I need to know if
you're following us.

03:56:19.762 --> 03:56:21.595
If you know where we are.

03:56:23.137 --> 03:56:26.528
What's the plan with you guys?

03:56:26.552 --> 03:56:27.552
Hope you're alone.

03:56:31.636 --> 03:56:34.821
If you're not.
(laughter)

03:56:34.845 --> 03:56:39.029
(laughter)

03:56:39.053 --> 03:56:40.571
MARISHA: Another
open-ended option.

03:56:40.595 --> 03:56:45.595
(laughter)

03:56:46.012 --> 03:56:47.612
MATT: This spell and
Jester is my favorite

03:56:47.636 --> 03:56:51.405
Pandora's Box combination
this entire campaign.

03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:52.803
TALIESIN: This is amazing.

03:56:54.053 --> 03:56:56.738
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

03:56:56.762 --> 03:57:00.363
(laughter)

03:57:00.387 --> 03:57:01.720
MATT: Astrid responds.

03:57:05.636 --> 03:57:09.928
"A volstrucker has never
disentangled from Trent before.

03:57:11.970 --> 03:57:14.528
"No one who knows what he does,

03:57:14.552 --> 03:57:16.571
"how he breaks us,

03:57:16.595 --> 03:57:19.552
"has shared their
trauma with the world."

03:57:20.512 --> 03:57:21.821
That's the end of her response.

03:57:21.845 --> 03:57:23.528
And then she follows
up with her own.

03:57:23.552 --> 03:57:25.012
SAM: Ooh! She's got her own?

03:57:26.471 --> 03:57:27.552
MATT: "With the king,

03:57:29.387 --> 03:57:32.528
"imagine the threat
you are to him

03:57:32.552 --> 03:57:36.053
"now that you carry respect
of both crown and Kryn.

03:57:37.552 --> 03:57:39.552
"So yes,

03:57:41.095 --> 03:57:43.220
"he's invested."

03:57:46.720 --> 03:57:48.053
LAURA: Oh shit.

03:57:49.552 --> 03:57:51.528
I tell Caleb all of that.

03:57:51.552 --> 03:57:52.845
SAM: Invested?

03:57:53.762 --> 03:57:54.528
LIAM: Break that
down for me again.

03:57:54.552 --> 03:57:55.528
Now that she--

03:57:55.552 --> 03:57:57.612
TRAVIS: Yes, he's, we're
a threat because we're--

03:57:57.636 --> 03:57:58.988
LIAM: Invested in both sides.

03:57:59.012 --> 03:57:59.821
TRAVIS: Crown and Kryn,

03:57:59.845 --> 03:58:02.904
but that didn't answer if
they know where we are.

03:58:02.928 --> 03:58:04.738
LAURA: They know where we are.

03:58:04.762 --> 03:58:07.488
MARISHA: Or invested means they
could still be researching it?

03:58:07.512 --> 03:58:09.447
MATT: The phrase
she referred to,

03:58:09.471 --> 03:58:11.179
which she explains that

03:58:13.137 --> 03:58:15.970
a volstrucker has never
disentangled from Trent before.

03:58:17.636 --> 03:58:20.363
No one who has gone
through the trauma

03:58:20.387 --> 03:58:21.552
of becoming a volstrucker

03:58:22.552 --> 03:58:25.113
has expressed the process

03:58:25.137 --> 03:58:25.928
and the abuse

03:58:27.304 --> 03:58:28.528
to the King

03:58:28.552 --> 03:58:30.179
or anyone outside of his employ.

03:58:32.845 --> 03:58:33.988
LAURA: So you're a
huge danger to him.

03:58:34.012 --> 03:58:35.071
MATT: So you're a
huge threat to him.

03:58:35.095 --> 03:58:36.528
MARISHA: Big ol' liability.

03:58:36.552 --> 03:58:38.528
TALIESIN: He's going
to kill us all.

03:58:38.552 --> 03:58:39.528
LAURA: He wants to.

03:58:39.552 --> 03:58:40.471
TALIESIN: He has to.

03:58:41.803 --> 03:58:43.528
LAURA: But if we can kill him.

03:58:43.552 --> 03:58:45.528
TRAVIS: We need to know
if they know where we are

03:58:45.552 --> 03:58:47.488
if they're coming.
TALIESIN: He won't cooperate.

03:58:47.512 --> 03:58:49.988
LIAM: Well, he sure would say
he'd like to cooperate, though,

03:58:50.012 --> 03:58:50.988
if we asked him.

03:58:51.012 --> 03:58:51.803
LAURA: I think

03:58:52.762 --> 03:58:55.528
by her saying yes,
Trent is invested,

03:58:55.552 --> 03:58:59.552
that's her saying that, yes,
they're coming after us.

03:59:01.220 --> 03:59:03.029
MARISHA: Well, in my opinion,

03:59:03.053 --> 03:59:05.863
that means we pick Essek
as our close person

03:59:05.887 --> 03:59:10.528
and then we hope the timing
works out in our favor

03:59:10.552 --> 03:59:11.552
with them.

03:59:12.552 --> 03:59:13.447
TRAVIS: Yes.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:59:13.471 --> 03:59:14.988
We need to,

03:59:15.012 --> 03:59:16.304
as we move forward,

03:59:17.552 --> 03:59:20.071
be ready for them just to be
here at a moment's notice.

03:59:20.095 --> 03:59:21.113
MARISHA: For sure.

03:59:21.137 --> 03:59:21.928
LIAM: So,

03:59:22.803 --> 03:59:25.363
you know, if we can think
our way out of a problem

03:59:25.387 --> 03:59:26.179
instead of

03:59:27.552 --> 03:59:30.528
attacking it like it's
an ancient obelisk

03:59:30.552 --> 03:59:31.720
in the middle of a field,

03:59:33.512 --> 03:59:34.488
that's the way to go

03:59:34.512 --> 03:59:36.970
because you want to have
all of your capabilities.

03:59:43.552 --> 03:59:44.552
I have

03:59:46.179 --> 03:59:47.612
this.

03:59:47.636 --> 03:59:50.220
And Caleb takes out a collar.

03:59:51.262 --> 03:59:52.779
You might recognize
this from our time

03:59:52.803 --> 03:59:55.071
inside of the Folding
Halls of Halas.

03:59:55.095 --> 03:59:55.887
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:59:56.845 --> 03:59:58.528
LIAM: I've been working
on it for a while.

03:59:58.552 --> 04:00:00.552
I've had a little bit
of help, thank you.

04:00:01.845 --> 04:00:02.678
SAM: You're welcome.

04:00:03.803 --> 04:00:05.552
LIAM: I don't think
I should have this.

04:00:09.595 --> 04:00:11.988
I think one of
the ladies should.

04:00:12.012 --> 04:00:14.654
And I'm not sure which.

04:00:14.678 --> 04:00:17.696
But if we can get
this on his neck

04:00:17.720 --> 04:00:19.528
in that crucial moment--

04:00:19.552 --> 04:00:20.946
MARISHA: With you
being a distraction.

04:00:20.970 --> 04:00:23.988
LIAM: We can buy ourselves
some time with him.

04:00:24.012 --> 04:00:26.738
TRAVIS: Trent's neck?
LIAM: Yes.

04:00:26.762 --> 04:00:27.803
SAM: What would it do?

04:00:28.595 --> 04:00:30.887
LIAM: It will prevent
him from being able to

04:00:32.137 --> 04:00:34.552
use his abilities on us.

04:00:37.552 --> 04:00:39.405
SAM: Well, Beau's very fast.

04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:41.863
LAURA: Beau's very fast
and Yasha's very strong.

04:00:41.887 --> 04:00:44.071
I think if we give that to Beau,

04:00:44.095 --> 04:00:45.887
Yasha can try to grapple him.

04:00:47.552 --> 04:00:48.738
MARISHA: And I can get it on.

04:00:48.762 --> 04:00:49.553
Sure.

04:00:50.552 --> 04:00:52.552
LAURA: Plus, you've
got a lot of attacks.

04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:55.321
MARISHA: I do.
TALIESIN: That's true.

04:00:55.345 --> 04:00:56.821
MARISHA: I do.

04:00:56.845 --> 04:00:58.762
Lot of opportunities
to stun him.

04:01:00.345 --> 04:01:03.071
SAM: To attach to
him, just has to be

04:01:03.095 --> 04:01:04.528
thrown around and strapped?

04:01:04.552 --> 04:01:06.238
LIAM: It's got to be
put around his neck.

04:01:06.262 --> 04:01:07.029
LAURA: And click.

04:01:07.053 --> 04:01:09.488
LIAM: Like a collar on a cat.

04:01:09.512 --> 04:01:10.863
SAM: Clicked, locked?
TRAVIS: No magic, no activation,

04:01:10.887 --> 04:01:11.678
no word?

04:01:12.803 --> 04:01:13.946
LIAM: Click it shut.

04:01:13.970 --> 04:01:16.447
MARISHA: Does it take time to

04:01:16.471 --> 04:01:17.904
attune, to connect?

04:01:17.928 --> 04:01:20.845
LIAM: Just needs to
clasp around his neck.

04:01:22.429 --> 04:01:23.779
MARISHA: Okay.

04:01:23.803 --> 04:01:25.053
TRAVIS: Well, that's the thing.

04:01:26.387 --> 04:01:27.155
LAURA: Wow.

04:01:27.179 --> 04:01:30.280
TALIESIN: I've got some spells
that might help that I've been

04:01:30.304 --> 04:01:31.552
thinking about preparing.

04:01:33.636 --> 04:01:36.137
Forbiddance, if we have a ruby

04:01:37.552 --> 04:01:38.512
around,

04:01:39.471 --> 04:01:40.262
is an option.

04:01:41.552 --> 04:01:42.821
TRAVIS: What does that do?

04:01:42.845 --> 04:01:46.387
TALIESIN: It creates
a very, very large

04:01:48.012 --> 04:01:48.803
field

04:01:51.720 --> 04:01:53.946
where teleportation
is not possible.

04:01:53.970 --> 04:01:56.280
LAURA: Oh yeah, the Traveler
was telling me about that.

04:01:56.304 --> 04:01:59.528
TALIESIN: Yeah. Like
40,000 feet square.

04:01:59.552 --> 04:02:00.696
LAURA: That's a pretty powerful
spell. TRAVIS: 40,000?!

04:02:00.720 --> 04:02:02.363
ASHLEY: What?
TALIESIN: Yep.

04:02:02.387 --> 04:02:04.280
TRAVIS: Nobody leaves,
everybody stays?

04:02:04.304 --> 04:02:06.738
TALIESIN: Nobody leaves.
Nobody can even Plane Shift.

04:02:06.762 --> 04:02:08.405
TRAVIS: Or come into the space?

04:02:08.429 --> 04:02:10.988
TALIESIN: You can come in,
but you can't teleport in.

04:02:11.012 --> 04:02:13.528
And you can also make
it so that certain

04:02:13.552 --> 04:02:16.738
types of creatures just
take damage when they enter.

04:02:16.762 --> 04:02:18.387
TRAVIS: Goodness gracious.

04:02:19.512 --> 04:02:21.095
LAURA: Can they teleport out?

04:02:22.552 --> 04:02:24.363
I feel like you can
teleport out of it.

04:02:24.387 --> 04:02:25.696
You just can't teleport into it.

04:02:25.720 --> 04:02:26.552
TALIESIN: That's right.

04:02:28.387 --> 04:02:31.512
It also proofs the area
against planar travel.

04:02:33.262 --> 04:02:36.529
So yeah, you can't get in by the
way of the Astral Plane, yeah.

04:02:36.553 --> 04:02:37.552
Or Plane Shift.

04:02:39.053 --> 04:02:41.363
Yeah. That plus
some silence spells

04:02:41.387 --> 04:02:43.529
that are always good
for dealing with

04:02:43.553 --> 04:02:45.071
magic people.

04:02:45.095 --> 04:02:46.447
LAURA: Yeah.

04:02:46.471 --> 04:02:47.552
TALIESIN: Get them in a bubble.

04:02:50.552 --> 04:02:52.071
LAURA: Symbol's pretty great.

04:02:52.095 --> 04:02:53.345
TALIESIN: Symbol's pretty great.

04:02:55.845 --> 04:02:57.238
LAURA: But Forbiddance is good.

04:02:57.262 --> 04:02:58.552
I don't know if I have any.

04:03:00.137 --> 04:03:02.821
How expensive of a ruby
does it need to be?

04:03:02.845 --> 04:03:05.029
MATT: It's 40,000 square feet.

04:03:05.053 --> 04:03:06.447
So you're aware,
yeah, not a radius.

04:03:06.471 --> 04:03:07.387
TALIESIN: Not a radius, no.

04:03:08.552 --> 04:03:09.471
1,000.

04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:11.220
LAURA: 1,000?

04:03:12.552 --> 04:03:13.738
I mean,

04:03:13.762 --> 04:03:16.262
my mama gave me
my ruby necklace.

04:03:17.053 --> 04:03:17.821
MARISHA: Oh no.

04:03:17.845 --> 04:03:19.238
TALIESIN: Well,
if it comes to it,

04:03:19.262 --> 04:03:20.528
we'll sleep on it.

04:03:20.552 --> 04:03:21.636
I would rather not.

04:03:24.512 --> 04:03:27.155
MARISHA: Also, something that
I want all of you spellcasters

04:03:27.179 --> 04:03:28.845
to commit to memory.

04:03:31.636 --> 04:03:33.552
When I was in there
fighting Lucien,

04:03:34.845 --> 04:03:37.238
jumping in balls deep,

04:03:37.262 --> 04:03:39.238
what I was able to learn

04:03:39.262 --> 04:03:41.429
is that he is resistant
to fire and necrotic,

04:03:42.220 --> 04:03:43.988
and he is immune

04:03:44.012 --> 04:03:46.321
to psychic, charm,

04:03:46.345 --> 04:03:48.137
frightened, and stunned.

04:03:50.262 --> 04:03:51.988
So commit that to memory

04:03:52.012 --> 04:03:54.738
when you're planning your
spells. SAM: Which ones again?

04:03:54.762 --> 04:03:56.196
MARISHA: Resistant.

04:03:56.220 --> 04:03:58.387
TRAVIS: Yeah, resistant
to fire and necrotic.

04:03:59.928 --> 04:04:03.552
MARISHA: You know, not
weaker there, you know?

04:04:04.928 --> 04:04:06.238
And then he is

04:04:06.262 --> 04:04:11.220
completely immune to psychic,
charm, frightened, stun.

04:04:14.471 --> 04:04:16.970
TRAVIS: Psychic, charm,
frightened, stun.

04:04:18.012 --> 04:04:19.552
LIAM: So no mind games with him.

04:04:21.552 --> 04:04:24.654
TALIESIN: That's good.
LIAM: This is difficult.

04:04:24.678 --> 04:04:25.803
SAM: Well, we can hit him.

04:04:26.678 --> 04:04:27.552
LIAM: Yeah.

04:04:28.595 --> 04:04:31.179
LAURA: As long as we don't
stand directly in front of him.

04:04:32.387 --> 04:04:35.447
TALIESIN: And we have some
tools to help with that, too.

04:04:35.471 --> 04:04:38.029
LAURA: Yeah. Oh,
that's right, we do.

04:04:38.053 --> 04:04:40.696
LIAM: Yeah, if we can set up
shop before they arrive we have

04:04:40.720 --> 04:04:41.988
three, I think

04:04:42.012 --> 04:04:43.155
of those intuit charges.

04:04:43.179 --> 04:04:44.571
The first one that we found

04:04:44.595 --> 04:04:46.738
and then there were
some in that bag.

04:04:46.762 --> 04:04:50.196
MATT: Correct. They were that
the Tomb Takers were carrying.

04:04:50.220 --> 04:04:51.528
LAURA: That's psychic
damage that it does, though,

04:04:51.552 --> 04:04:52.488
so it wouldn't do
nothing to him.

04:04:52.512 --> 04:04:53.988
LIAM: Oh, nothing
to them, right.

04:04:54.012 --> 04:04:56.528
LAURA: But we do have the
Allura-- the things Allura gave
us

04:04:56.552 --> 04:04:59.821
which keeps them from doing
anti-magic against us.

04:04:59.845 --> 04:05:01.738
LIAM: No, it shows us.

04:05:01.762 --> 04:05:05.113
It's like a black light and
shows where he's put it down

04:05:05.137 --> 04:05:06.612
so we can see it
moving through space.

04:05:06.636 --> 04:05:08.280
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't
prevent it, but it gives you

04:05:08.304 --> 04:05:11.528
some strategic information
TRAVIS: Indicator.

04:05:11.552 --> 04:05:13.363
LIAM: We're not
fighting blind to it.

04:05:13.387 --> 04:05:15.280
LAURA: Got it.

04:05:15.304 --> 04:05:16.762
MARISHA: Are we going to start

04:05:17.720 --> 04:05:19.779
at the secret entrance
that we know of?

04:05:19.803 --> 04:05:21.904
Or are we going to work
our way backwards to there?

04:05:21.928 --> 04:05:23.654
Feel like we should
start there, right?

04:05:23.678 --> 04:05:24.970
LAURA: Start there.
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:05:26.012 --> 04:05:29.113
LAURA: Start there and are
we going into the ruins?

04:05:29.137 --> 04:05:29.904
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:05:29.928 --> 04:05:32.363
LAURA: We got to go into the
ruins from the secret entrance

04:05:32.387 --> 04:05:33.179
and hope that--

04:05:34.512 --> 04:05:35.304
MARISHA: Beat him.

04:05:36.387 --> 04:05:37.262
LAURA: Should we

04:05:38.262 --> 04:05:40.280
tell all of Essek's
people to move away

04:05:40.304 --> 04:05:41.803
from the secret entrance so that

04:05:43.053 --> 04:05:44.904
they think they can use it?

04:05:44.928 --> 04:05:47.528
So we can lead them
down the correct path?

04:05:47.552 --> 04:05:49.612
MARISHA: I think
that's brilliant. Yeah.

04:05:49.636 --> 04:05:52.528
I think the more we cat
and mouse them the better.

04:05:52.552 --> 04:05:55.363
LIAM: Do we want to delve
too far into the ruins?

04:05:55.387 --> 04:05:57.571
Because the ruins, most likely,

04:05:57.595 --> 04:05:59.654
have their own dangers
to us and we don't

04:05:59.678 --> 04:06:02.155
want to drain ourselves--
LAURA: This is true.

04:06:02.179 --> 04:06:03.528
LIAM: -- climbing through it.

04:06:03.552 --> 04:06:06.528
So we certainly don't want to
be waiting on the doorstep.

04:06:06.552 --> 04:06:10.196
LAURA: My worry is that they
won't use that entrance,

04:06:10.220 --> 04:06:12.447
they'll have another
entrance and they'll just

04:06:12.471 --> 04:06:15.528
go around back and we'll never
even know that they already

04:06:15.552 --> 04:06:18.405
did all their shit until
the city is upon us.

04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:20.528
SAM: Well, we should
have a second team.

04:06:20.552 --> 04:06:23.012
Not of us, but Essek's men

04:06:24.304 --> 04:06:26.738
at the main entrance
or is there a main?

04:06:26.762 --> 04:06:28.447
TALIESIN: There are
guards, if I recall,

04:06:28.471 --> 04:06:30.571
at the main entrance
to the temple

04:06:30.595 --> 04:06:33.471
but I don't think anyone
knows how to get to this wing

04:06:36.345 --> 04:06:37.528
through the main entrance.

04:06:37.552 --> 04:06:39.738
LIAM: Can we, out
of character here,

04:06:39.762 --> 04:06:41.946
review what we
know, which is you

04:06:41.970 --> 04:06:44.863
had your vision thanks
to your dope roll.

04:06:44.887 --> 04:06:47.071
MATT: He knows exactly
where that secret entrance.

04:06:47.095 --> 04:06:48.571
LIAM: Secret entrance
to it is, okay.

04:06:48.595 --> 04:06:50.155
SAM: That's where
they're going to go in.

04:06:50.179 --> 04:06:51.970
TALIESIN: That's where
they're going to try first.

04:06:54.137 --> 04:06:55.988
MATT: There are multiple
excavations of the ruins.

04:06:56.012 --> 04:06:57.779
There are multiple
entrances to the ruins,

04:06:57.803 --> 04:07:00.988
but some of them
are controlled by,

04:07:01.012 --> 04:07:02.552
you know, different factions.

04:07:04.262 --> 04:07:06.612
Some have been abandoned
because they collapsed possibly,

04:07:06.636 --> 04:07:09.447
some of them are
controlled by this outpost,

04:07:09.471 --> 04:07:10.553
some are controlled by

04:07:12.678 --> 04:07:13.946
Empire interests.

04:07:13.970 --> 04:07:15.612
LIAM: And they no
longer know where we are

04:07:15.636 --> 04:07:16.779
or what we're doing.

04:07:16.803 --> 04:07:17.654
LAURA: Right.

04:07:17.678 --> 04:07:19.029
SAM: We can just wait for them.

04:07:19.053 --> 04:07:20.904
TRAVIS: I feel like
we'll need to see it.

04:07:20.928 --> 04:07:23.155
Any of Essek's men that are

04:07:23.179 --> 04:07:25.678
going to be a part of this
are going to be dead men.

04:07:26.636 --> 04:07:29.405
So cat and mouse is good,

04:07:29.429 --> 04:07:30.696
but we also need to
see the entrance,

04:07:30.720 --> 04:07:32.528
what's after the entrance,
and maybe a little bit

04:07:32.552 --> 04:07:34.863
further into that, depending
on how much time we have.

04:07:34.887 --> 04:07:39.280
If there is a terrain
that suits an ambush,

04:07:39.304 --> 04:07:41.528
we have to scope it first.

04:07:41.552 --> 04:07:43.738
TALIESIN: It's also possible
we could collapse that entrance

04:07:43.762 --> 04:07:45.528
and force them
through the main one.

04:07:45.552 --> 04:07:46.512
TRAVIS: Possible.

04:07:47.552 --> 04:07:50.528
LAURA: But there's no main
one, there's multiple ones.

04:07:50.552 --> 04:07:51.528
You know what I mean?

04:07:51.552 --> 04:07:52.612
TALIESIN: There's the
one that everyone knows.

04:07:52.636 --> 04:07:53.946
LAURA: Yeah.

04:07:53.970 --> 04:07:55.821
SAM: I like the ambush plan.

04:07:55.845 --> 04:07:56.904
TALIESIN: Ambush
plan is not bad.

04:07:56.928 --> 04:07:58.471
LIAM: Yeah. But you're right,

04:07:59.552 --> 04:08:02.071
we're just guessing a little
bit, so we need to take a look.

04:08:02.095 --> 04:08:03.029
SAM: Should we go now?

04:08:03.053 --> 04:08:05.904
MARISHA: The moment we
pop off those traps,

04:08:05.928 --> 04:08:07.528
they'll know.
TRAVIS: Yes.

04:08:07.552 --> 04:08:08.970
MARISHA: Show our hand.

04:08:10.095 --> 04:08:12.529
There could actually
be something to

04:08:12.553 --> 04:08:14.571
collapsing the tunnel

04:08:14.595 --> 04:08:16.155
once they're in

04:08:16.179 --> 04:08:19.720
so that they can't backtrack
the moment they set the trap.

04:08:20.553 --> 04:08:22.528
TRAVIS: Or as they're coming in.

04:08:22.552 --> 04:08:25.321
MARISHA: And that could be
something that we have Essek's
men

04:08:25.345 --> 04:08:27.071
do from the outside
and they just watch,

04:08:27.095 --> 04:08:28.179
let them go in,

04:08:29.552 --> 04:08:32.571
give it a moment, blast
the tunnel, then hopefully

04:08:32.595 --> 04:08:33.928
spring our trap.

04:08:35.053 --> 04:08:36.155
TRAVIS: We need to see it.

04:08:36.179 --> 04:08:37.238
MARISHA: We need to see it.

04:08:37.262 --> 04:08:38.528
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I got some thoughts.

04:08:38.552 --> 04:08:40.363
LAURA: Get there before them.

04:08:40.387 --> 04:08:41.821
MARISHA: Is there any
reason for us to stay here?

04:08:41.845 --> 04:08:43.238
Or should we go right now?

04:08:43.262 --> 04:08:44.571
TRAVIS: We should let--
LIAM: We should go right now.

04:08:44.595 --> 04:08:47.571
TRAVIS: -- Essek know that--
MATT: (light knocking)

04:08:47.595 --> 04:08:49.528
MARISHA: Who is it?
LIAM: Yeah, hello?

04:08:49.552 --> 04:08:51.029
MATT: "It's Essek."
MARISHA: Oh.

04:08:51.053 --> 04:08:52.238
MARISHA: Hey, come in.
LIAM: Come on in.

04:08:52.262 --> 04:08:54.363
LAURA: Wait, we're naked!

04:08:54.387 --> 04:08:56.280
MATT: The doorway opens, stops.

04:08:56.304 --> 04:08:58.552
And slowly opens. (sigh)

04:09:00.552 --> 04:09:02.738
The door opens the rest
of its way on its own.

04:09:02.762 --> 04:09:05.528
You see he's wearing
his heavy cloak with the

04:09:05.552 --> 04:09:08.447
heavy fur trim around the
side for the cold weather.

04:09:08.471 --> 04:09:11.528
He has a pouch over his
shoulder, tucked underneath.

04:09:11.552 --> 04:09:13.821
He has an orb

04:09:13.845 --> 04:09:17.196
that's affixed to
his side that he just

04:09:17.220 --> 04:09:19.612
lifts up and it
drifts above his hand.

04:09:19.636 --> 04:09:21.654
And you watch as
it warms up a bit

04:09:21.678 --> 04:09:24.528
and creates this radius
of warmth around.

04:09:24.552 --> 04:09:26.528
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: He goes,

04:09:26.552 --> 04:09:27.471
"I have what I need.

04:09:28.512 --> 04:09:30.405
"Are you all ready to go?"

04:09:30.429 --> 04:09:31.196
SAM: I think so.

04:09:31.220 --> 04:09:33.528
LIAM: As ready as we're
going to be, yeah.

04:09:33.552 --> 04:09:36.095
MATT: "All right.
Have you decided?"

04:09:37.803 --> 04:09:39.970
LIAM: Yes, Essek, we are
going to stick with you.

04:09:41.512 --> 04:09:42.887
We feel we can trust you more

04:09:43.803 --> 04:09:45.447
than my old teacher.

04:09:45.471 --> 04:09:46.946
LAURA: Also, that guy,

04:09:46.970 --> 04:09:48.137
he can't float.

04:09:49.552 --> 04:09:50.552
MATT: "You're not wrong."

04:09:51.720 --> 04:09:52.738
You see,

04:09:52.762 --> 04:09:55.552
when you say the word "trust,"

04:09:57.345 --> 04:09:59.528
it's simultaneously like seeing

04:09:59.552 --> 04:10:01.552
a small hit to the heart.

04:10:02.845 --> 04:10:05.363
And whatever icy
bit that cracked

04:10:05.387 --> 04:10:06.779
melts away for a minute.

04:10:06.803 --> 04:10:09.528
There's a moment of him
hearing the word and letting it

04:10:09.552 --> 04:10:11.179
wash over him.

04:10:20.304 --> 04:10:22.447
"I'm thankful for the
trust you put in me.

04:10:22.471 --> 04:10:23.262
"And

04:10:25.012 --> 04:10:25.803
"I hope to

04:10:27.762 --> 04:10:28.720
"make this

04:10:29.720 --> 04:10:30.552
"up to you.

04:10:32.552 --> 04:10:33.678
"Anyway, I'm,

04:10:34.678 --> 04:10:37.137
"bad at such
discussions. Shall we?"

04:10:38.552 --> 04:10:39.696
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:10:39.720 --> 04:10:42.946
Essek, do you still have men
stationed at that entrance

04:10:42.970 --> 04:10:45.155
that we told you
about before we left?

04:10:45.179 --> 04:10:48.552
MATT: "I do. I have seven
men and that Dagen."

04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:51.321
LAURA: Oh, cool! MATT: "That
man that you sent to us."

04:10:51.345 --> 04:10:53.528
MARISHA: Fucking
Dagen, that's right.

04:10:53.552 --> 04:10:55.280
SAM: Do they have the
ability to communicate

04:10:55.304 --> 04:10:57.488
with you telepathically
or send a message?

04:10:57.512 --> 04:10:58.863
MATT: "No, but I can
send them a message."

04:10:58.887 --> 04:11:00.821
MARISHA: When was the last
time you checked in with them?

04:11:00.845 --> 04:11:02.447
MATT: "That would
be this morning."

04:11:02.471 --> 04:11:03.988
MARISHA: Oh, great.
Everything okay?

04:11:04.012 --> 04:11:05.528
MATT: "So far, so good, yes.

04:11:05.552 --> 04:11:07.447
"They're growing a bit bored
up there, but, you know,

04:11:07.471 --> 04:11:08.946
"that's part of the job."

04:11:08.970 --> 04:11:10.863
SAM: If there's any danger,
there's no way of them

04:11:10.887 --> 04:11:12.345
reaching out to you, though.

04:11:14.552 --> 04:11:15.887
MATT: "Unfortunately, no."

04:11:18.552 --> 04:11:19.488
SAM: Okay.

04:11:19.512 --> 04:11:22.113
TRAVIS: These men,
are they fighters?

04:11:22.137 --> 04:11:24.095
Do they have arcane
abilities as well?

04:11:25.220 --> 04:11:26.488
MATT: "They are not.

04:11:26.512 --> 04:11:27.738
"Based on specifically
what you told me,

04:11:27.762 --> 04:11:31.304
"they are trained
rangers, combatants,

04:11:32.552 --> 04:11:34.738
"individuals that are now

04:11:34.762 --> 04:11:37.471
"ready to use the environment
to their advantage."

04:11:38.552 --> 04:11:40.113
LAURA: They're good at hiding?

04:11:40.137 --> 04:11:41.612
MATT: "They are extremely
good at hiding."

04:11:41.636 --> 04:11:44.155
MARISHA: Have they been
hiding while they patrol this

04:11:44.179 --> 04:11:46.528
or have they been
openly standing guard?

04:11:46.552 --> 04:11:48.405
MATT: "I would assume
they have been hiding,

04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:49.654
"it is what their specialty is."

04:11:49.678 --> 04:11:51.779
TRAVIS: And hiding
by physical means?

04:11:51.803 --> 04:11:53.405
Blending into their environment?

04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:54.738
MATT: "Yes."
TRAVIS: Good.

04:11:54.762 --> 04:11:56.528
That might help. TALIESIN:
Probably will be enough.

04:11:56.552 --> 04:11:59.845
We're dealing without someone
who's very good at seeing.

04:12:01.387 --> 04:12:04.528
MATT: "They do have a means of
communicating in an emergency.

04:12:04.552 --> 04:12:06.238
"That would be--"
TRAVIS: (impact)

04:12:06.262 --> 04:12:07.447
MATT: "Yes,

04:12:07.471 --> 04:12:09.447
"a flare stone.

04:12:09.471 --> 04:12:12.196
"But since they are not
practitioners of magic,

04:12:12.220 --> 04:12:14.196
"they do not have
that capability."

04:12:14.220 --> 04:12:15.321
TRAVIS: That's good.

04:12:15.345 --> 04:12:16.803
LAURA: How far away
is the entrance?

04:12:18.387 --> 04:12:20.738
MATT: "It's a better part
of a day's travel for me."

04:12:20.762 --> 04:12:21.552
LAURA: Oh, okay.

04:12:24.552 --> 04:12:25.654
MATT: "Let's see how
the weather holds up.

04:12:25.678 --> 04:12:29.528
"But if we march on,

04:12:29.552 --> 04:12:33.363
"a heavy march, we will arrive
by or just past sundown.

04:12:33.387 --> 04:12:35.571
"Otherwise, we will make
camp and then arrive

04:12:35.595 --> 04:12:36.696
"first thing in the morning."

04:12:36.720 --> 04:12:39.321
SAM: Okay. Let's go, then.
TRAVIS: Yes.

04:12:39.345 --> 04:12:40.946
TALIESIN: I'll need one more
rest before anything happens,

04:12:40.970 --> 04:12:41.928
so that's good.

04:12:44.012 --> 04:12:44.803
MATT: "All right.

04:12:46.304 --> 04:12:47.095
"Mighty Nein,

04:12:48.552 --> 04:12:51.137
"you're almost
fulfilling your number,"

04:12:52.552 --> 04:12:55.196
And he drifts out into the cold,

04:12:55.220 --> 04:12:56.429
open air of the day.

04:12:57.471 --> 04:12:59.904
TRAVIS: Dagen makes nine.
MARISHA: Yeah, he does!

04:12:59.928 --> 04:13:00.720
SAM: We'll follow.

04:13:02.471 --> 04:13:05.528
MATT: All right, as you step
out, you can see the guard

04:13:05.552 --> 04:13:07.904
that has been stationed within
this outpost has been doubled

04:13:07.928 --> 04:13:09.738
since your arrival.

04:13:09.762 --> 04:13:13.488
Likely placed at the
knowledge of Trent's

04:13:13.512 --> 04:13:15.552
possible arrival.

04:13:17.053 --> 04:13:19.528
But they all see you off

04:13:19.552 --> 04:13:21.988
giving a respectful chest

04:13:22.012 --> 04:13:25.155
and hand bow towards
Essek and you

04:13:25.179 --> 04:13:27.946
as you make your way
beyond the outpost

04:13:27.970 --> 04:13:32.137
and back onto the familiar
white snow covered icy plains

04:13:33.053 --> 04:13:36.387
of the valley
cresting into the bowl

04:13:37.595 --> 04:13:39.528
that is the ruin of Aeor.

04:13:39.552 --> 04:13:40.946
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:13:40.970 --> 04:13:42.238
MATT: And we'll pick up
from there next week.

04:13:42.262 --> 04:13:44.029
MARISHA: Oh!

04:13:44.053 --> 04:13:45.571
TRAVIS: No problem. No problem.

04:13:45.595 --> 04:13:48.280
MATT: Well cool, I get to
bring this mini in now.

04:13:48.304 --> 04:13:50.363
(cheering)

04:13:50.387 --> 04:13:52.196
MARISHA: Buddy!
LAURA: Yay!

04:13:52.220 --> 04:13:53.363
MATT: You had choices.

04:13:53.387 --> 04:13:55.488
LIAM: Take a picture
and share it with us.

04:13:55.512 --> 04:13:56.528
MATT: I will, I will,
I'll send it to you.

04:13:56.552 --> 04:13:58.863
MARISHA: Look at that
little war criminal.

04:13:58.887 --> 04:13:59.678
MATT: Right?

04:14:01.387 --> 04:14:02.552
Awesome. Good game, guys.

04:14:04.512 --> 04:14:07.696
LIAM: Who among us has not
handed over the most precious
object

04:14:07.720 --> 04:14:09.528
in our country's possession?

04:14:09.552 --> 04:14:12.863
MARISHA: Yeah. Who hasn't
committed a little war crime?

04:14:12.887 --> 04:14:14.363
A little treason.

04:14:14.387 --> 04:14:16.071
LIAM: A little
patricide on this side.

04:14:16.095 --> 04:14:18.321
MATT: (laughs)

04:14:18.345 --> 04:14:20.113
Man, this is some, like,

04:14:20.137 --> 04:14:22.528
Northern Crater heading into
the final dungeon battle.

04:14:22.552 --> 04:14:23.738
TRAVIS: Yep.
ASHLEY: Yep.

04:14:23.762 --> 04:14:25.238
MATT: All right, all right.

04:14:25.262 --> 04:14:27.528
Well, we'll pick up
from there next week.

04:14:27.552 --> 04:14:30.220
Thank you all so
much for joining us.

04:14:31.552 --> 04:14:32.405
We love you very much.

04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:34.363
And is it Thursday yet?

04:14:34.387 --> 04:14:35.179
Good night.

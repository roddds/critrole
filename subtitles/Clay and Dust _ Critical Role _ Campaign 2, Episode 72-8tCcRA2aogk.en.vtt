00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:02.225
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.225 --> 00:00:04.288
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:06.477
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:06.477 --> 00:00:08.917
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:10.270
MATT: Case in point.

6
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.548
Before we jump into tonight's game,

7
00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:14.798
we have some announcements to get through.

8
00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:16.473
First and foremost, we have our first

9
00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:18.193
of two sponsors for tonight's episode,

10
00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:21.630
beginning with our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

11
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.056
TRAVIS: (operatic) D&amp;D Beyond!

12
00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.284
MATT: What is it now?

13
00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.035
SAM: Guys, finally the election for presidency

14
00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:30.176
of D&amp;D Beyond is officially open.

15
00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:34.811
Head over to D&amp;D Beyond to cast your vote, for real.

16
00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:37.154
Get special rewards just for voting,

17
00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:39.949
like character sheet backgrounds and portrait frames.

18
00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.942
Voting closes August 2nd during the live show

19
00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.986
at Gen Con during intermission.

20
00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:49.986
Go vote now at dndbeyond.link/crelection.

21
00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:54.650
Now to wrap out the campaign-- nothing too crazy tonight.

22
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.139
We're just going to, each of us, me and Liam,

23
00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:02.041
are going to just read a brief closing statement. That's it.

24
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.414
Cue the stirring music.

25
00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:04.360
(clears throat)

26
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.654
(triumphant music)

27
00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:06.545
SAM: Sure.

28
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.738
My fellow Samericans, for months you have

29
00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:11.456
watched me compete for your vote.

30
00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:14.239
I've weathered insults, I've survived scandal,

31
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:17.775
and I pushed through very, far too long comedy bits,

32
00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:18.874
like this one.

33
00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:21.565
I know that many of you think that I haven't taken this race

34
00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:23.854
as seriously as I should have. After all,

35
00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:26.840
the President of D&amp;D Beyond is a real position

36
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.936
that demands respect and true leadership.

37
00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:32.304
Which is why tonight, I have no gag.

38
00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:33.929
There's no comedy, there's no joke,

39
00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.321
no sound effects or master debating.

40
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.467
There's no mime-clown-juggler waiting in the wings.

41
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.314
(laughs)

42
00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.522
MARISHA: (laughs)

43
00:01:44.522 --> 00:01:45.822
SAM: Not the time, Max.

44
00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:46.905
Not the time.

45
00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:52.708
Tonight, I'm just going to be real, all right?

46
00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:53.666
Hi!

47
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:56.382
I'm Sam Riegel, an ordinary guy

48
00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.309
who wants to bring D&amp;D Beyond into the future.

49
00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:00.938
Rules, structure, I get it, okay?

50
00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:03.954
It's important, but that spark that brings us to this table

51
00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:07.314
every Thursday night, the excitement of the unknown?

52
00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:09.489
That anything could happen in D&amp;D?

53
00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.548
That's what this game that we love, and my campaign,

54
00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:13.829
are all about.

55
00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.198
Preserving the game, sure, but also evolving it

56
00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:19.183
and hooking a new generation of DMs and players.

57
00:02:19.183 --> 00:02:22.705
With this app, we can all build great encounters

58
00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.645
and great things together.

59
00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.195
I'm Sam Riegel.

60
00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:27.404
The kind of guy--

61
00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:28.840
(laughter)

62
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.231
SAM: The kind of guy you'd want to hang out with at a bar

63
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.622
while you sip a beer

64
00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:36.327
and while I sip a 2015 Bryant Family Cabernet Sauvignon.

65
00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:38.056
(laughter)

66
00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:41.644
SAM: I'm Sam Riegel, a man of the people.

67
00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:44.776
I put on my pants in the morning just like you guys,

68
00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:46.864
with one servant per leg and two more

69
00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:48.738
strapping on my girdle.

70
00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:51.707
I'm Sam Riegel, a regular Joe.

71
00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:54.483
When I get back from work, my dog Zuckerberg

72
00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:57.602
always jumps up and greets me at the airlock,

73
00:02:57.602 --> 00:02:59.185
my two lovely kids,

74
00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:05.423
Jim, James, I want to say Jim,

75
00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:07.081
and...

76
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:08.164
the girl.

77
00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:09.497
(laughter)

78
00:03:09.497 --> 00:03:13.086
SAM: Well, they're the love of my life, the apple of my eye.

79
00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:14.344
I couldn't do this without them.

80
00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:16.083
You know what, I think there might be a third kid,

81
00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:18.361
but don't quote me on that.

82
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:21.400
I'm Sam Riegel, and no matter what you may think of me,

83
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.343
I'm devoted, every Thursday night,

84
00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:27.483
for the past 18 months, to shining a weird, wacky,

85
00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:29.905
musical and sometimes clever light

86
00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:32.836
on the fine people at D&amp;D Beyond.

87
00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:34.114
Why should I lead them?

88
00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:37.232
Well, because I literally have no other skills.

89
00:03:37.232 --> 00:03:39.751
So please, give me this chance to show

90
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.693
what I can bring to this company,

91
00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:45.550
to this game we love, to D&amp;D, and beyond.

92
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.108
Thank you, and God bless, you know what,

93
00:03:48.108 --> 00:03:50.192
it's just two kids, I think the third one

94
00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:52.102
was just over for a sleepover that night,

95
00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:53.561
and I got confused.

96
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:55.042
But it's just two kids.

97
00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:57.073
God bless Samerica.

98
00:03:57.073 --> 00:03:57.906
Liam?

99
00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:01.490
(triumphant music)

100
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.266
LIAM: Cut the music, please.

101
00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:05.035
Cut the music!

102
00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:07.052
SAM: That's not funny. Oh no.

103
00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:12.161
LIAM: Listen, folks.

104
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.146
I don't have to tell you things are bad.

105
00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:18.640
Everybody knows things are bad

106
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.701
under Riegel's stewardship of D&amp;D Beyond.

107
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.463
The bits are getting longer and the prep time

108
00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.212
is getting shorter.

109
00:04:26.212 --> 00:04:27.458
(laughter)

110
00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:28.416
LIAM: Misinformed players are

111
00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:30.607
getting TPKed across the globe.

112
00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:34.616
Matthew Mercer is hiding from silly string under the table.

113
00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:37.500
His wife is punching players left and right

114
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.611
and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do,

115
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.506
and there's no end to it.

116
00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:44.605
We know the spots are unfit for broadcast

117
00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:47.284
and the details are factually incoherent,

118
00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:49.539
and we sit here watching our Twitch accounts

119
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.695
while this organ grinder monkey

120
00:04:51.695 --> 00:04:54.952
would have us believe that D&amp;D Beyond is about the yuks,

121
00:04:54.952 --> 00:04:57.361
and how many dicks we can slide into the conversation,

122
00:04:57.361 --> 00:04:59.765
as if that's the way it's supposed to be!

123
00:05:00.907 --> 00:05:03.803
We know things are bad, worse than bad. They're crazy.

124
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.508
It's like everything everywhere is going crazy

125
00:05:05.508 --> 00:05:07.213
and nobody questions it anymore.

126
00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:09.638
We sit at our tables and slowly the game we enjoy

127
00:05:09.638 --> 00:05:12.587
is turning into Romper Room, and all we can do

128
00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:16.471
is say please, I love this game so much,

129
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:18.915
just give me my half orc and hit dice.

130
00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:22.932
I promise I'll listen to this mad man's wine preferences

131
00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:26.890
and awful accent work week after week!

132
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.063
(laughter)

133
00:05:28.063 --> 00:05:30.742
LIAM: If just Critical Role, give me 10 minutes

134
00:05:30.742 --> 00:05:35.075
of actual gameplay this week! I guess that's enough.

135
00:05:36.243 --> 00:05:37.991
But I say that's not enough!

136
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:39.878
(laughter)

137
00:05:39.878 --> 00:05:41.529
LIAM: I want you to get mad!

138
00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.657
I don't want you to write, I don't want you to protest,

139
00:05:43.657 --> 00:05:45.218
I don't want you to write to Chris Perkins,

140
00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:48.004
because I don't know what to tell you to write.

141
00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:50.784
I don't know what to do about this man's ignorance

142
00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:54.813
of rogue mechanics, or the flagrant firbolg shooting,

143
00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:58.560
or the collusion with England, or the constant ego-fluffing.

144
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.783
All I know is that, first, you've got to get mad.

145
00:06:00.783 --> 00:06:01.616
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

146
00:06:01.616 --> 00:06:04.799
LIAM: You've got to stand up and say I'm a D&amp;D Beyond user,

147
00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:07.246
god dammit! These stats have value!

148
00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:09.496
(laughter)

149
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.172
LIAM: So.

150
00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:17.609
I want you all to get up.

151
00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:22.409
I want you to get up out of your chairs.

152
00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:24.352
All of you.

153
00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:26.713
Right now.

154
00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:30.335
I want you to go and spam the Twitch chat.

155
00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:35.175
Get up and hammer that election box with your Johnson.

156
00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:38.539
I want you to create disgruntled fan art.

157
00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.098
I want you to get up and grab your computer,

158
00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:43.913
enable voice detect, and I want you to yell,

159
00:06:43.913 --> 00:06:46.607
I want you to yell, "I'm mad! Mad!"

160
00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.975
I want you to yell, "I'm mad as hell

161
00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:51.888
"and I'm not going to take Sam anymore!"

162
00:06:51.888 --> 00:06:56.528
Mordenkainen is rolling in his grave!

163
00:06:56.528 --> 00:07:01.028
(prolonged beep)

164
00:07:05.248 --> 00:07:06.231
SAM: Where did we go?

165
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:07.064
MATT: Okay.

166
00:07:07.064 --> 00:07:08.330
SAM: What just happened?

167
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.233
What did you cut to?

168
00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:10.400
What happened?

169
00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.262
(laughter)

170
00:07:13.262 --> 00:07:14.243
MATT: All right.

171
00:07:14.243 --> 00:07:15.076
So.

172
00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:17.875
Put your votes in!

173
00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:21.191
For someone.

174
00:07:22.418 --> 00:07:24.784
Thank you, Sam and Liam,

175
00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:28.888
and thank you, well,

176
00:07:28.888 --> 00:07:29.950
D&amp;D Beyond.

177
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.783
SAM: Sure.

178
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.843
TRAVIS: That was nuts.

179
00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:34.053
SAM: Holy shit.

180
00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:35.534
LIAM: I'm a passionate man.

181
00:07:35.534 --> 00:07:39.956
MATT: You are a very passionate man, and I love that movie.

182
00:07:39.956 --> 00:07:41.942
Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

183
00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:43.653
We got one week to figure out which of these two

184
00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:45.924
chuckleheads is going to win.

185
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.372
Our second sponsor tonight.

186
00:07:48.372 --> 00:07:51.388
(laughter)

187
00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.221
TALIESIN: Oh god.

188
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:56.551
LIAM: Kids in 2019 love homages to films from the '70s.

189
00:07:56.551 --> 00:07:59.514
TALIESIN: Wow.
(laughter)

190
00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:02.157
MATT: To be fair, the cool ones do.

191
00:08:02.157 --> 00:08:03.582
Right?

192
00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.651
TALIESIN: Wow.

193
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.231
MATT: Our fantastic second sponsor tonight,

194
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:11.922
return sponsor, our friends at Idle Champions.

195
00:08:11.922 --> 00:08:13.514
TRAVIS: Idle Champions!

196
00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:15.579
MATT: For those who haven't heard our spiel before,

197
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:16.730
or haven't had a chance to check it out,

198
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.698
Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms

199
00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:21.233
is a strategy game using iconic characters

200
00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:23.556
from Dungeons &amp; Dragons lore as well as novels,

201
00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:27.050
campaigns, and shows, all at your fingertips.

202
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.661
It's available for PC, Mac, Steam, and on the web,

203
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:32.495
along with Xbox and PS4, where you get to

204
00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:33.883
build your own party of these characters,

205
00:08:33.883 --> 00:08:36.071
outfit then with equipment, send then into dungeon runs

206
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:38.283
and adventures and storylines based on actual

207
00:08:38.283 --> 00:08:40.492
official D&amp;D stories.

208
00:08:40.492 --> 00:08:42.925
They just apparently released a huge massive update

209
00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:44.665
focused on their year one champions,

210
00:08:44.665 --> 00:08:47.237
which includes a classic, Drizzt Do'Urden.

211
00:08:47.237 --> 00:08:48.279
LAURA: Yes!

212
00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:51.478
MATT: Everyone's favorite dark elf ranger with a panther

213
00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:52.858
and dual scimitars.

214
00:08:52.858 --> 00:08:53.691
He's got a long history.

215
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:56.074
If you don't know who I'm talking about, you should read.

216
00:08:56.074 --> 00:08:58.946
As well as a number of legendary champions of the hall.

217
00:08:58.946 --> 00:09:01.857
Legendary companions of the hall, my apologies.

218
00:09:01.857 --> 00:09:03.942
To celebrate this update, all players can claim

219
00:09:03.942 --> 00:09:08.376
one free gold chest with the code Rebalanced4U.

220
00:09:08.376 --> 00:09:10.676
One word, Rebalanced4U.

221
00:09:10.676 --> 00:09:12.930
The U is a letter U.

222
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.704
Which can be entered in the in-game shop as we speak,

223
00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:16.614
right now.

224
00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:19.687
Check out the game at IdleChampions.com/CriticalRole.

225
00:09:19.687 --> 00:09:21.067
TRAVIS: Nice.

226
00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:22.795
MATT: All right.

227
00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.086
Thank you, sponsors.

228
00:09:24.086 --> 00:09:26.576
A couple other updates. First off,

229
00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:29.494
on Monday, July 29th, at 7PM Pacific

230
00:09:29.494 --> 00:09:31.154
here on the Twitch channel, we'll be airing

231
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:33.825
our very own special Call of Cthulhu one-shot,

232
00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:36.539
run by our brilliant Taliesin Jaffe.

233
00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:37.706
TRAVIS: The dark lord!

234
00:09:37.706 --> 00:09:41.332
MATT: His dark and twisted mind has apparated this tale

235
00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:44.034
for a number of players familiar to those of you

236
00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:45.353
who've been following us for a while.

237
00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:47.957
Some at this table, some not, who will be

238
00:09:47.957 --> 00:09:48.790
joining from the sides.

239
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.052
I think we've already announced, actually.

240
00:09:50.052 --> 00:09:52.586
TALIESIN: Yeah, not everybody lived, but yeah.

241
00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:53.419
LAURA: So scary.

242
00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:54.355
(laughter)

243
00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:58.656
TALIESIN: There is a creepy mime walking around the studio.

244
00:09:58.656 --> 00:09:59.897
He's lurking.

245
00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:00.968
That was some fucking lurking.
LAURA: He's so much creepier

246
00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:01.801
now that he doesn't have

247
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:02.634
the clown wig on.

248
00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:03.467
TALIESIN: Oh god, stop!

249
00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:04.483
(laughter)

250
00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:05.316
MATT: He's still stalking.

251
00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:06.649
TALIESIN: He's so quiet.

252
00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:09.047
MATT: The game is called The Shadow of the Crystal Palace,

253
00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:10.847
is the story. It'll be on our Twitch channel.

254
00:10:10.847 --> 00:10:12.187
If you miss the live broadcast,

255
00:10:12.187 --> 00:10:14.072
it will be available on VOD on our YouTube channel

256
00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.626
the following Wednesday.

257
00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:16.949
So look for that.

258
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.027
A huge thank you to everybody who came out

259
00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:22.389
to San Diego Comic-Con to see our panel on Friday.

260
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:26.264
We've already placed it on our YouTube channel, I believe,

261
00:10:26.264 --> 00:10:28.586
as it was on Talks this previous Tuesday,

262
00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.517
so if you missed it, it's available to watch now.

263
00:10:30.517 --> 00:10:31.604
LAURA: Thank you for all the questions,

264
00:10:31.604 --> 00:10:33.320
especially for me and Travis.

265
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.037
(laughter)

266
00:10:35.037 --> 00:10:37.427
SAM: Are you being salty to our audience?

267
00:10:37.427 --> 00:10:38.984
LAURA: Yes, I am.

268
00:10:38.984 --> 00:10:41.984
SAM: Thank you legitimately for all the questions for me.

269
00:10:41.984 --> 00:10:42.817
(laughter)

270
00:10:42.817 --> 00:10:44.149
I had four or five.

271
00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:45.417
(laughter)

272
00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:47.493
MATT: For bringing such interesting conversations points

273
00:10:47.493 --> 00:10:48.762
for interesting people.

274
00:10:48.762 --> 00:10:51.734
(laughter)

275
00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:55.233
TRAVIS: Bless you, bless you.

276
00:10:55.233 --> 00:10:57.865
MATT: Yeah, and a shout-out and thank you to the McElroys

277
00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.983
and our friends at Adventure Zone

278
00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:01.654
for inviting me and Marisha to be

279
00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:02.631
on their Friday night reading.

280
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:03.719
It was so much fun to finally get a chance

281
00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:05.065
to meet the whole family and for us to hang out that night

282
00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:07.881
and be silly, and a guy named Lin showed up.

283
00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:08.881
That was fun, too.

284
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:10.298
MARISHA: Yeah.

285
00:11:11.214 --> 00:11:12.092
MATT: Kind of cool.

286
00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:13.915
Also as a reminder, next week's episode of Critical Role

287
00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:16.356
will be on Friday instead of Thursday,

288
00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:19.577
as it will be our live show at Gen Con.

289
00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:21.153
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

290
00:11:21.153 --> 00:11:22.737
MATT: Instead of our normal Thursday slot,

291
00:11:22.737 --> 00:11:26.619
it'll be Friday, August 2nd at 5PM Pacific,

292
00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:30.892
8PM Eastern, which is we start it there, at Eastern time.

293
00:11:30.892 --> 00:11:33.454
A VOD will be available as per usual,

294
00:11:33.454 --> 00:11:36.945
and YouTube on Monday, so look for that.

295
00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:38.055
Laura, you have some updates.

296
00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:41.052
LAURA: Oh, yeah, well, so you know,

297
00:11:41.052 --> 00:11:43.701
we put on the website that we announced

298
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:45.800
some of our live show merch that's going to be available

299
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.192
at Gen Con, so I'm just going to show it off.

300
00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:51.398
We've got our d20, our oversized d20,

301
00:11:51.398 --> 00:11:54.316
I may have had a hand in--
SAM: Whoa, it's big.

302
00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:56.563
LAURA: It's a giant d20!

303
00:11:56.563 --> 00:11:58.119
There you go.

304
00:11:58.119 --> 00:11:58.952
What'd you roll?

305
00:11:58.952 --> 00:11:59.785
SAM: Four.

306
00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:00.618
TALIESIN: Here, here.

307
00:12:00.618 --> 00:12:03.044
LAURA: It's sparkly. You can't really tell on the website.

308
00:12:03.044 --> 00:12:05.219
TALIESIN: Oh god, it looks like Wonder Girl.

309
00:12:05.219 --> 00:12:08.081
LAURA: We've got this-- oh, this bag o' dice.

310
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:08.914
SAM: Oh!

311
00:12:08.914 --> 00:12:10.011
Oh shit.

312
00:12:10.011 --> 00:12:10.943
TRAVIS: It was not a 20.

313
00:12:10.943 --> 00:12:11.818
TALIESIN: No, it was not a 20.

314
00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:13.383
LAURA: Oh my god, if it was a 20.

315
00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:15.532
These are gorgeous. They're gorgeous.

316
00:12:15.532 --> 00:12:17.248
You can go on the website and check it out.

317
00:12:17.248 --> 00:12:19.248
Our shop and everything.

318
00:12:20.731 --> 00:12:21.956
Because here's the thing,

319
00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:23.431
these are all going to be available

320
00:12:23.431 --> 00:12:26.072
at our live shows, but as of next year,

321
00:12:26.072 --> 00:12:29.422
any overstock that we have, we're going to make it available

322
00:12:29.422 --> 00:12:32.969
on the store as well, so I know some people are sad

323
00:12:32.969 --> 00:12:34.683
because they won't be able to get the live merch,

324
00:12:34.683 --> 00:12:35.986
if they're not going to be able to be there,

325
00:12:35.986 --> 00:12:39.796
but have patience, because it might be available later on.

326
00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:44.065
Then also, look at this cutie cutie chibi Jester pin.

327
00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:47.234
TRAVIS: Aww, look at that. Is that a donut behind her?

328
00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:50.496
LAURA: This is our live show variant of it.

329
00:12:50.496 --> 00:12:53.237
When I say variant, that means that there's going to be

330
00:12:53.237 --> 00:12:57.557
a non-variant version available in the store very soon.

331
00:12:57.557 --> 00:12:58.623
Chibi Jester.

332
00:12:58.623 --> 00:12:59.959
(laughter)

333
00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:02.044
LAURA: I'm in charge of merch, you guys. Jester and dice.

334
00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:03.609
(laughter)

335
00:13:03.609 --> 00:13:08.075
LAURA: Also, available I think right now--

336
00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:10.991
oh, and this by the way, this chibi design

337
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:13.569
is designed by Jenny Parks, because she's amazing.

338
00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:14.686
Did I say Park?

339
00:13:14.686 --> 00:13:16.122
Park, Jenny Park.

340
00:13:16.122 --> 00:13:17.656
She's so awesome.

341
00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:21.964
Then we also have this Vox Machina Origins pin

342
00:13:21.964 --> 00:13:23.045
in the store.

343
00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:23.878
It's yeah, for our comic book.

344
00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:24.755
TALIESIN: From our comic book.

345
00:13:24.755 --> 00:13:26.971
SAM: Where is that? Is that in our store?

346
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:28.263
LAURA: This is in our store.
SAM: Now?

347
00:13:28.263 --> 00:13:31.371
LAURA: Yeah, it's available in our US and our UK shop,

348
00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:32.271
right now.

349
00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:33.974
LIAM: Can I have that one?

350
00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:36.139
LAURA: This was our like sample one that came in,

351
00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:37.475
so it's like extra special.

352
00:13:37.475 --> 00:13:38.506
LIAM: Can I have it?

353
00:13:38.506 --> 00:13:40.150
LAURA: I mean, maybe.

354
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.541
I can say yes now and then I might take it back.

355
00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:43.716
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

356
00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:46.149
(laughter)

357
00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:47.605
LAURA: So yeah, that's goin' on.

358
00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:48.438
SAM: That's great stuff.

359
00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:49.271
LAURA: Yeah, right?

360
00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:50.826
I'm going to play with the oversized tonight.

361
00:13:50.826 --> 00:13:51.880
SAM: Oh.

362
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.713
That's amazing.

363
00:13:52.713 --> 00:13:53.546
LAURA: Oh my god--

364
00:13:53.546 --> 00:13:55.833
SAM: She'll play with every one that we make and sell.

365
00:13:55.833 --> 00:13:57.056
LAURA: Yes, obviously.

366
00:13:57.056 --> 00:13:57.973
MATT: Individually.

367
00:13:57.973 --> 00:14:00.175
LAURA: Where did the oversized dice go?

368
00:14:00.175 --> 00:14:01.900
Taliesin took it.

369
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.924
(laughter)

370
00:14:02.924 --> 00:14:03.913
LAURA: We can share it tonight.

371
00:14:03.913 --> 00:14:04.971
TALIESIN: All right, I'll do that.

372
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:06.287
Okay, yeah, right there.

373
00:14:06.287 --> 00:14:08.453
LIAM: I still have an unhealthy amount of adrenaline.

374
00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:09.459
SAM: (laughs) You're shaking.

375
00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:11.160
LAURA: I know, you are, you're like--

376
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.078
SAM: Wow.

377
00:14:12.078 --> 00:14:14.659
TALIESIN: Somewhere there's a parent who is realizing

378
00:14:14.659 --> 00:14:17.072
that he has to explain to their child

379
00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:19.710
what Network is, and that excites me.

380
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.704
MATT: Oh, it's so good.

381
00:14:20.704 --> 00:14:23.064
MARISHA: I can feel hundreds of those conversations

382
00:14:23.064 --> 00:14:24.208
happening at once.

383
00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:25.041
TALIESIN: I remember when I was

384
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:26.974
given that DVD for Christmas.

385
00:14:26.974 --> 00:14:27.934
It was like that deep.

386
00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:29.426
MARISHA: Everyone should watch Network.

387
00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:30.628
Mandatory viewing.

388
00:14:30.628 --> 00:14:32.400
MATT: Not only is it a classic film, but it gets

389
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.341
more and more poignant with every passing year.

390
00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.305
Anyway.

391
00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:41.355
I believe that concludes our announcements, so.

392
00:14:41.355 --> 00:14:42.765
MARISHA: Like a Tisch School for the Arts audition.

393
00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:43.969
(clapping)

394
00:14:43.969 --> 00:14:44.802
SAM: Oh, sorry.

395
00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:46.328
MATT: Let's go ahead and jump in
(laughter)

396
00:14:46.328 --> 00:14:49.761
to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

397
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:52.708

398
00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:54.832

(dragon roaring)

434
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:29.885
MATT: And welcome back.

435
00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:33.790
So last we left off, the Mighty Nein

436
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.331
had finished their business, it seemed, in returning

437
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:40.659
the remnants of Nott's family to safety

438
00:16:40.659 --> 00:16:43.104
on the Menagerie Coast in Nicodranas,

439
00:16:43.104 --> 00:16:47.378
under the watch of Marion Lavore, mother of Jester.

440
00:16:47.378 --> 00:16:52.036
They had figured out what business they wished to focus on

441
00:16:52.036 --> 00:16:55.030
at the time being, and with a little bit more knowledge

442
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.941
about the history of Caduceus's family purpose

443
00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:02.392
and main goal, along with the unveiling of information

444
00:17:02.392 --> 00:17:04.726
regarding these shattered artifacts

445
00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:06.579
that you've been slowly assembling

446
00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.351
in disparate places across Wildemount,

447
00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:12.233
you decided to travel far north to the Greying Wildlands,

448
00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:16.094
beyond both the Dynasty and the Empire,

449
00:17:16.094 --> 00:17:19.927
into the outskirts of the conflict and beyond.

450
00:17:21.817 --> 00:17:25.547
Through the help of Essek, the Shadowhand within Xhorhas,

451
00:17:25.547 --> 00:17:28.255
you found yourselves instantaneously teleported,

452
00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:32.234
with a brief misfire and a bit of physical damage

453
00:17:32.234 --> 00:17:35.450
to the party, you emerged

454
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.228
underneath a growing flurry

455
00:17:37.228 --> 00:17:41.449
of snow in the center of the Flotket Alps.

456
00:17:41.449 --> 00:17:45.574
Looking upon the snow-covered pine forests

457
00:17:45.574 --> 00:17:48.642
that swallowed the valley before you.

458
00:17:48.642 --> 00:17:52.420
The large cragulous peaks covered with ice and white,

459
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.925
as the clouds above began to grow darker and darker,

460
00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:57.282
the growth of a blizzard

461
00:17:57.282 --> 00:17:59.113
making its way in your direction.

462
00:17:59.113 --> 00:18:00.907
A lake in the center of this valley,

463
00:18:00.907 --> 00:18:02.752
and along the singular black mountain,

464
00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:04.910
where snowfall cannot seem to find purchase

465
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.258
long enough before melting.

466
00:18:06.258 --> 00:18:09.962
The various, slow, glowing trickles of molten rock

467
00:18:09.962 --> 00:18:13.267
finding their way down the mountain from various vents

468
00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:16.199
before hissing into a large column of steam

469
00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:19.558
as they reach the outskirts of this lake.

470
00:18:21.024 --> 00:18:24.074
And that is where we pick up.

471
00:18:26.511 --> 00:18:28.521
Suddenly, the freezing temperature

472
00:18:28.521 --> 00:18:30.266
clutches each of you.

473
00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:31.587
Looking across the way--

474
00:18:31.587 --> 00:18:32.420
SAM: (sneezes)

475
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.253
LAURA: Bless you!

476
00:18:33.253 --> 00:18:34.183
SAM: It's freezing here.

477
00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:36.433
(laughter)

478
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:42.228
MATT: Essek, looking around,

479
00:18:42.228 --> 00:18:47.228
"Very well, you have your destination. (grunts)"

480
00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:49.568
You can see him shrugging off a little bit of,

481
00:18:49.568 --> 00:18:50.959
you know, vein bulge in his forehead

482
00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:53.899
from the damage he also sustained along the journey.

483
00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:58.364
"I will make my way back to my city of origin.

484
00:18:58.364 --> 00:18:59.542
"Good luck."

485
00:18:59.542 --> 00:19:01.797
He turns around and finds a small area

486
00:19:01.797 --> 00:19:03.604
under one of the nearby trees and begins

487
00:19:03.604 --> 00:19:05.343
carving a small circle into the ground.

488
00:19:05.343 --> 00:19:06.386
Familiar to you.

489
00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:07.749
SAM: Anything you can tell us about this area

490
00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:08.972
before you leave?

491
00:19:08.972 --> 00:19:11.151
MATT: Not looking up, still drawing amongst the root.

492
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:14.129
SAM: I say, oh, sorry, no, go on.

493
00:19:14.129 --> 00:19:15.658
MATT: "I have not been here.

494
00:19:15.658 --> 00:19:17.433
"Otherwise, this would not have been

495
00:19:17.433 --> 00:19:19.408
"as tumultuous a journey."

496
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:22.391
LAURA: Yeah, that felt really good, by the way.

497
00:19:22.391 --> 00:19:23.277
Thank you.

498
00:19:23.277 --> 00:19:26.108
MATT: "Not all powerful magic is perfect."

499
00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:28.969
MARISHA: I think it makes him more likable, to be honest.

500
00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:30.391
SAM: Flawed character.
MARISHA: Exactly.

501
00:19:30.391 --> 00:19:31.335
TRAVIS: Imperfection.
MARISHA: Yeah.

502
00:19:31.335 --> 00:19:33.453
LIAM: We will be in touch while we are here.

503
00:19:33.453 --> 00:19:34.286
MATT: "Please do.

504
00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:36.145
"Let me know, should you require anything."

505
00:19:36.145 --> 00:19:39.670
LIAM: Just stalling for time a bit,

506
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.303
if you know.

507
00:19:44.699 --> 00:19:45.815
MATT: "And with that," and he steps

508
00:19:45.815 --> 00:19:48.106
into the circle, and vanishes.

509
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.998
LAURA: So you can do that, too. We're not stranded here.

510
00:19:52.998 --> 00:19:55.439
LIAM: Well, so far, my average is pretty good.

511
00:19:55.439 --> 00:19:58.409
I haven't put us inside a wall.

512
00:19:58.409 --> 00:19:59.414
SAM: That's true.

513
00:19:59.414 --> 00:20:01.429
LIAM: Maybe later, though.

514
00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:03.767
LAURA: We can always hope.

515
00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:07.259
SAM: Caducey, where are we going?

516
00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:08.092
LAURA: Ow.

517
00:20:08.092 --> 00:20:09.200
Shut up.

518
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.442
(laughter)

519
00:20:12.287 --> 00:20:14.363
TALIESIN: I think we're going there.

520
00:20:14.363 --> 00:20:15.280
Look at it.

521
00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:18.831
This is going to be fun.

522
00:20:18.831 --> 00:20:20.514
TRAVIS: You've never been here before, right?

523
00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:23.289
TALIESIN: No, no, I haven't.

524
00:20:27.118 --> 00:20:29.224
This is a lot.

525
00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:32.080
LAURA: Have you seen it in your visions, though?

526
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.262
TALIESIN: I have.

527
00:20:33.262 --> 00:20:37.429
I have seen it from a distance, from very high up.

528
00:20:38.392 --> 00:20:43.392
It's a little colder than I expected, but, (sighs)

529
00:20:43.624 --> 00:20:48.416
is there even the slightest sense of civilization

530
00:20:48.416 --> 00:20:49.466
anywhere?

531
00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:51.345
Are we just out in the middle of--

532
00:20:51.345 --> 00:20:52.511
MATT: From where you stand right now,

533
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:54.002
make a perception check.

534
00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:55.258
TRAVIS: Get it.

535
00:20:55.258 --> 00:20:56.797
TALIESIN: I was hoping to make a perception check

536
00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:58.669
about three miles out, but fine.

537
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:59.627
14.

538
00:20:59.627 --> 00:21:01.197
SAM: Got to use that big dice.

539
00:21:01.197 --> 00:21:02.731
LAURA: That's true, you should've used this.

540
00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:03.731
TALIESIN: Next time.

541
00:21:05.814 --> 00:21:09.664
MATT: What you see is mountain,

542
00:21:09.664 --> 00:21:13.505
ridge, snow, tree,

543
00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:16.282
lava, and rock.

544
00:21:16.282 --> 00:21:17.115
TRAVIS: Bob Ross.

545
00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:19.115
MATT: You see no signs of civilization,

546
00:21:19.115 --> 00:21:22.281
you see no structures

547
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:26.472
from this perspective, you're on the opposite side

548
00:21:26.472 --> 00:21:29.621
of this lake facing towards the mountain, Kravaraad.

549
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:31.341
TALIESIN: This is perfect.

550
00:21:31.341 --> 00:21:33.457
TRAVIS: How far are we from that lake?

551
00:21:33.457 --> 00:21:34.479
Can we see if it's frozen over?

552
00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:36.510
MATT: Actually, now that it's arrived.

553
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.835
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

554
00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:42.729
Sorry, Deven, sorry, sorry, sorry, Deven.

555
00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:45.480
ALL: Ooh, ahh.

556
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.717
LAURA: Ooh, this map is, like, beat up.

557
00:21:48.717 --> 00:21:50.647
This one was harder to get.

558
00:21:50.647 --> 00:21:51.480
MARISHA: It's got blood on it, too!

559
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.569
Why do all our maps have blood on them?

560
00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:55.293
TRAVIS: Crystal Lands Tundra.

561
00:21:55.293 --> 00:21:57.519
TALIESIN: That's from the nosebleed.
SAM: This is awesome.

562
00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:58.793
SAM: So where are we?

563
00:21:58.793 --> 00:22:00.001
MARISHA: Altitude.

564
00:22:00.001 --> 00:22:02.668
TRAVIS: Emerald Gulch, so we're, what?

565
00:22:03.694 --> 00:22:05.485
Krakow? Where are we? What?

566
00:22:05.485 --> 00:22:06.367
MATT: Kravaraad.

567
00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:08.891
SAM: Flotket Alps at Kravaraad.

568
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:10.649
TRAVIS: Kravaraad.

569
00:22:10.649 --> 00:22:12.499
LAURA: Whoa, like in the middle?

570
00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:13.443
SAM: Fraggle Rock.

571
00:22:13.443 --> 00:22:14.542
LAURA: ♪ Down in Kravaraad ♪

572
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.739
TRAVIS: There's a lake, yeah, not too far away

573
00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:19.949
from the Cindercrest Sanctum?

574
00:22:19.949 --> 00:22:21.321
Cindercrest?

575
00:22:21.321 --> 00:22:23.621
Cinderrest.
TALIESIN: Sure.

576
00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:24.579
Man.

577
00:22:24.579 --> 00:22:29.400
TRAVIS: Something that says Uthodurn.

578
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.666
Is that the fucking place?

579
00:22:31.666 --> 00:22:33.394
TALIESIN: I don't know.

580
00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:34.898
TRAVIS: I think that's the one they said with the--

581
00:22:34.898 --> 00:22:35.918
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah--

582
00:22:35.918 --> 00:22:37.142
TRAVIS: The sword?

583
00:22:37.142 --> 00:22:38.589
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

584
00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:39.506
MARISHA: Let me see.

585
00:22:39.506 --> 00:22:40.666
TRAVIS: Do we remember if that's the name?

586
00:22:40.666 --> 00:22:43.796
SAM: Uthodurn, elves and dwarves, question mark.

587
00:22:43.796 --> 00:22:44.702
That's what I wrote down.

588
00:22:44.702 --> 00:22:46.006
TRAVIS: They live together in harmony

589
00:22:46.006 --> 00:22:47.230
and they can forge amazing weapons

590
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.484
made of badassery and shit?

591
00:22:48.484 --> 00:22:50.751
TRAVIS: That's the gist of what you recall.

592
00:22:50.751 --> 00:22:52.694
LAURA: We're going to go meet elves and dwarves!

593
00:22:52.694 --> 00:22:55.354
TALIESIN: It's right next door to where we're going.

594
00:22:55.354 --> 00:22:56.270
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

595
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.478
TALIESIN: It's as if destiny itself brought us here.

596
00:22:58.478 --> 00:22:59.936
TRAVIS: Great. You want me to spread this out?

597
00:22:59.936 --> 00:23:01.823
MARISHA: Star Razor is the name of the sword?

598
00:23:01.823 --> 00:23:03.214
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Okay.

599
00:23:03.214 --> 00:23:06.120
LIAM: Caduceus, this is your story, I think.

600
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.312
Which way do we go?

601
00:23:08.312 --> 00:23:09.812
Where do we enter?

602
00:23:13.368 --> 00:23:14.201
TALIESIN: Well.

603
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.556
LIAM: Was anything passed down to you?

604
00:23:18.556 --> 00:23:21.418
You know, through spoken word from your family, or--

605
00:23:21.418 --> 00:23:24.435
TALIESIN: Well, there were conversations,

606
00:23:24.435 --> 00:23:28.290
but again, they were conflicting and strange.

607
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.346
I don't know anybody who'd ever been here before,

608
00:23:30.346 --> 00:23:33.241
if they had, they didn't admit to it.

609
00:23:33.241 --> 00:23:34.074
But,

610
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.220
if I were walking, looking for a place,

611
00:23:41.384 --> 00:23:45.250
I would head right up to where

612
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.866
the lava springs from.

613
00:23:48.866 --> 00:23:51.080
I say we just head right in.

614
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.983
TALIESIN: Sure.

615
00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:53.586
LAURA: Won't we melt?

616
00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:54.486
TALIESIN: Nah.

617
00:23:54.486 --> 00:23:56.368
MARISHA: What if there's like an entrance from the side

618
00:23:56.368 --> 00:24:00.499
or something that might be less deadly.

619
00:24:00.499 --> 00:24:01.507
TALIESIN: Less polite, though.

620
00:24:01.507 --> 00:24:03.595
You usually just want to knock on the front door.

621
00:24:03.595 --> 00:24:07.039
The side door just seems very personal.

622
00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.476
LIAM: Direct as always.

623
00:24:08.476 --> 00:24:10.636
TRAVIS: I'm sure we'll see as we head up, right?

624
00:24:10.636 --> 00:24:11.469
LAURA: Sure.

625
00:24:11.469 --> 00:24:12.642
TALIESIN: The closer we get,

626
00:24:12.642 --> 00:24:14.129
I think we'll get a sense of it.

627
00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:15.523
I'm a little giddy.

628
00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:17.195
TRAVIS: Sorry, I was blanking out on the map.

629
00:24:17.195 --> 00:24:20.112
Is the lake frozen or liquid water?

630
00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:23.276
MATT: From what you can tell, there is steam rising.

631
00:24:23.276 --> 00:24:25.062
You cannot see from this distance

632
00:24:25.062 --> 00:24:29.750
if the entire lake is not frozen or is frozen,

633
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.016
but wherever the molten rock is hitting,

634
00:24:33.016 --> 00:24:33.936
there is steam rising.

635
00:24:33.936 --> 00:24:36.484
TALIESIN: That storm's on its way right now, right?

636
00:24:36.484 --> 00:24:37.785
It's definitely--
SAM: Yeah.

637
00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:40.219
TALIESIN: Why don't we head towards the lake,

638
00:24:40.219 --> 00:24:42.922
see if we can find some warm water,

639
00:24:42.922 --> 00:24:44.797
and I don't know how far we're going to get

640
00:24:44.797 --> 00:24:47.109
before it gets impossible to move forward,

641
00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:50.542
but at least let's make our way there

642
00:24:50.542 --> 00:24:52.214
before we have to bed down.

643
00:24:52.214 --> 00:24:53.202
TRAVIS: Agreed.

644
00:24:53.202 --> 00:24:54.672
MARISHA: Follow and walk along the lake?

645
00:24:54.672 --> 00:24:55.505
SAM: Yeah.

646
00:24:55.505 --> 00:24:56.596
LAURA: Okay.

647
00:24:56.596 --> 00:24:59.084
MARISHA: We were at the beach yesterday.

648
00:24:59.084 --> 00:25:03.106
LAURA: Yeah, what a shift.
TALIESIN: What a world.

649
00:25:03.106 --> 00:25:05.504
LAURA: Is anybody super cold?

650
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:08.018
TALIESIN: I've got my big coat, and I put my hood up.

651
00:25:08.018 --> 00:25:11.309
LAURA: I feel fine, but if anyone is cold.

652
00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:13.540
SAM: I've got some cold stuff that I bought.

653
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.952
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: How are our humans doing?

654
00:25:15.952 --> 00:25:17.033
LIAM: How are we doing?

655
00:25:17.033 --> 00:25:20.100
MARISHA: I have my adrenaline.
LIAM: Scarf and a coat.

656
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.086
MATT: It's chilly.

657
00:25:22.086 --> 00:25:24.255
LIAM: You have no sleeves.

658
00:25:24.255 --> 00:25:29.255
MARISHA: I'm fine, I have my strength and physical prowess.

659
00:25:29.385 --> 00:25:31.496
LAURA: I pull out the Rod of Hand Warming

660
00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.247
and I hand it over to Beau.

661
00:25:33.247 --> 00:25:34.816
TALIESIN: I forgot we had that.

662
00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:36.411
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I'll take that.

663
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:37.620
That's nice.

664
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.419
SAM: We also need the Wand of Smiles out here.

665
00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:41.258
We have that still?

666
00:25:41.258 --> 00:25:43.012
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

667
00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:44.761
SAM: We never used that.

668
00:25:44.761 --> 00:25:45.878
LAURA: You know.

669
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.981
TALIESIN: We never use the Rod of Smiles.

670
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:50.645
LAURA: I can make people smile without it, so.

671
00:25:50.645 --> 00:25:52.528
SAM: That's true.

672
00:25:52.528 --> 00:25:56.159
TRAVIS: Trees where we are or barren up to the mountainside?

673
00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:58.054
MATT: There are trees, they're a little bit

674
00:25:58.054 --> 00:26:00.187
scattered on the edge, you're basically

675
00:26:00.187 --> 00:26:03.518
at the base of a mountain that heads down into this valley,

676
00:26:03.518 --> 00:26:05.461
and then across the valley is where this Kravaraad

677
00:26:05.461 --> 00:26:07.496
dark rock mountain is.

678
00:26:07.496 --> 00:26:09.928
Where you are, there are a few trees,

679
00:26:09.928 --> 00:26:12.742
not too closely clustered, and then the further down

680
00:26:12.742 --> 00:26:17.742
in the valley you go, the more it becomes a pinewood forest.

681
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.010
TRAVIS: Ducey?

682
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.785
TALIESIN: I say we head towards it,

683
00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:24.785
and if anybody gets a feeling

684
00:26:24.785 --> 00:26:29.785
or sees anything along the way, just

685
00:26:29.785 --> 00:26:31.252
make yourself known.

686
00:26:31.252 --> 00:26:33.143
LAURA: I'm going to keep my eyes out for anything

687
00:26:33.143 --> 00:26:35.061
I get a feeling about.

688
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:37.094
MATT: Okay, fair enough.
TRAVIS: I'll keep an eye on the treetops

689
00:26:37.094 --> 00:26:38.854
until we're out into a clearing.

690
00:26:38.854 --> 00:26:40.357
MARISHA: I'll watch the lake.

691
00:26:40.357 --> 00:26:42.455
MATT: Okay. Could I have a marching order?

692
00:26:42.455 --> 00:26:43.646
MARISHA: No.

693
00:26:43.646 --> 00:26:44.530
LAURA: Caduceus.

694
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.167
TALIESIN: I'll come out in front.

695
00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:47.280
TRAVIS: I'm next to Ducey.

696
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.764
MATT: All right, Caduceus is up front,

697
00:26:48.764 --> 00:26:50.223
and we have Fjord next to Caduceus.

698
00:26:50.223 --> 00:26:51.386
SAM: I'll go next.

699
00:26:51.386 --> 00:26:55.596
Sipping on some booze to keep me warm.

700
00:26:55.596 --> 00:26:56.536
TALIESIN: Laid back.

701
00:26:56.536 --> 00:26:58.487
LAURA: I'll go behind Nott.

702
00:26:58.487 --> 00:26:59.570
MATT: All righty.

703
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.281
Beau?

704
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:04.066
MARISHA: I'll come up the rears.

705
00:27:04.066 --> 00:27:06.063
MATT: All right, there you go, so.

706
00:27:06.063 --> 00:27:07.174
(laughter)

707
00:27:07.174 --> 00:27:08.707
LAURA: Yeah.

708
00:27:08.707 --> 00:27:09.856
MATT: Unless you have a preference.

709
00:27:09.856 --> 00:27:11.681
LIAM: No.
MATT: Okay.

710
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.447
All right, so.

711
00:27:15.534 --> 00:27:19.136
Heading down into the deeper and deeper regions

712
00:27:19.136 --> 00:27:22.580
of this wood, I need two of you to go ahead

713
00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.789
and make a perception check.

714
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:26.699
If you were the one that was saying--
TRAVIS: I'll help you do it.

715
00:27:26.699 --> 00:27:27.701
MATT: You said you were keeping an eye for anything strange.

716
00:27:27.701 --> 00:27:28.762
LAURA: Yes, I am.

717
00:27:28.762 --> 00:27:29.716
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, please.

718
00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:30.742
MATT: So it'll be the two of you.

719
00:27:30.742 --> 00:27:32.847
SAM: Oh, so you don't get help.

720
00:27:32.847 --> 00:27:33.809
MATT: Or you can help him.

721
00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:35.202
TALIESIN: Go ahead, yeah.

722
00:27:35.202 --> 00:27:36.447
LAURA: Should I roll that one, too?

723
00:27:36.447 --> 00:27:38.759
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think we both roll this one.

724
00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:41.047
LAURA: Oh god, what if we both roll low on it?

725
00:27:41.047 --> 00:27:43.364
Oh good, ha ha.
TALIESIN: See, that ain't happening.

726
00:27:43.364 --> 00:27:44.380
SAM: Buy this dice.

727
00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.463
LAURA: Perception?

728
00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:46.571
MATT: Yes.

729
00:27:46.571 --> 00:27:47.965
LAURA: 23.

730
00:27:47.965 --> 00:27:50.629
MATT: 23, not bad.
LAURA: No wait, is that right?

731
00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:53.206
TALIESIN: Five plus--
LAURA: Yeah, plus eight.

732
00:27:53.206 --> 00:27:54.097
23.

733
00:27:54.097 --> 00:27:55.412
MATT: There you go.

734
00:27:55.412 --> 00:27:57.375
That'll work out, okay.

735
00:27:57.375 --> 00:28:01.144
You all trudge through the crunching snow,

736
00:28:01.144 --> 00:28:02.669
the feet eventually pushing through into

737
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:06.603
the softer floors of the forest here,

738
00:28:06.603 --> 00:28:09.907
making your way past large, looks like rocks or lava bombs

739
00:28:09.907 --> 00:28:11.787
that at some point in the past may have been jettisoned

740
00:28:11.787 --> 00:28:13.543
by Kravaraad, and just landed

741
00:28:13.543 --> 00:28:17.885
and seem to be these unnatural

742
00:28:17.885 --> 00:28:21.768
and like a sore thumb sticking out

743
00:28:21.768 --> 00:28:22.969
amongst the rest of the topography.

744
00:28:22.969 --> 00:28:25.932
These large pieces of black volcanic rock.

745
00:28:25.932 --> 00:28:28.164
TALIESIN: I'd love to stop and look at one for a second,

746
00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:30.756
just to get a good, is it just volcanic rock,

747
00:28:30.756 --> 00:28:33.515
or is there any mineral deposits in it,

748
00:28:33.515 --> 00:28:36.016
if I give it a bit of a scrape and get into it?

749
00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:38.600
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

750
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.954
TALIESIN: <i>That</i> one. Okay.

751
00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:40.929
MATT: Mm-hmm.

752
00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:42.096
TALIESIN: That's fair.

753
00:28:44.169 --> 00:28:45.512
14.

754
00:28:45.512 --> 00:28:46.777
MATT: 14.

755
00:28:46.777 --> 00:28:50.039
It looks like, upon close inspection,

756
00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:52.229
there are elements in the exterior that are

757
00:28:52.229 --> 00:28:55.601
porous volcanic rock, but scraping away bits of it,

758
00:28:55.601 --> 00:29:00.482
a large portion of this is probably standard granite.

759
00:29:00.482 --> 00:29:02.587
Whatever this was, the entire mountain

760
00:29:02.587 --> 00:29:04.707
is not made of volcanic rock, but whatever this was,

761
00:29:04.707 --> 00:29:06.794
it was probably jettisoned out during some sort

762
00:29:06.794 --> 00:29:08.601
of an ancient explosion.

763
00:29:08.601 --> 00:29:09.617
LAURA: It's graphite.

764
00:29:09.617 --> 00:29:10.515
We're fucked.

765
00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:11.473
MATT: Oh, shit.

766
00:29:11.473 --> 00:29:14.647
Yeah, your hand begins to tingle, Caduceus.

767
00:29:14.647 --> 00:29:15.647
TALIESIN: All right.

768
00:29:17.613 --> 00:29:19.076
MATT: But continuing onward.

769
00:29:19.076 --> 00:29:21.159
MARISHA: (shuddering)

770
00:29:22.838 --> 00:29:24.706
MATT: I'm trying to remember the time of day

771
00:29:24.706 --> 00:29:27.079
you guys had journeyed from at this point.

772
00:29:27.079 --> 00:29:30.569
It'd been relatively midday, if I recall.

773
00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:34.374
Because you had stayed the night in Nicodranas,

774
00:29:34.374 --> 00:29:37.854
and then journeyed back to Rosohna.

775
00:29:37.854 --> 00:29:38.687
SAM: In the morning.

776
00:29:38.687 --> 00:29:41.036
MATT: In the morning, and stayed a bit just to kind of,

777
00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:43.471
so it's like late afternoon, we'll say.

778
00:29:43.471 --> 00:29:45.656
Because you had some time to make your plans with Yeza

779
00:29:45.656 --> 00:29:47.744
and meet with Essek and get everything situated there.

780
00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:50.411
So like midday, early afternoon.

781
00:29:51.784 --> 00:29:53.501
You still have a few hours of daylight,

782
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:55.957
you assume at this point in time.

783
00:29:55.957 --> 00:29:59.268
The journey itself is marked by gray skies

784
00:29:59.268 --> 00:30:02.768
and a growing flurry of snowfall and wind,

785
00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:07.721
and the wind is, it adjusts, sometimes it grows

786
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:09.947
really strong and bites through,

787
00:30:09.947 --> 00:30:11.698
and you all have to stop and try and find yourself

788
00:30:11.698 --> 00:30:14.525
to cover for a bit, and then it calms,

789
00:30:14.525 --> 00:30:17.261
and you trudge on further and further,

790
00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:18.982
the canopy of the forest eventually blocking

791
00:30:18.982 --> 00:30:21.134
your entire view of the valley

792
00:30:21.134 --> 00:30:25.557
as you begin to reach the bottom of its trough.

793
00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.989
As you were keeping an eye out,

794
00:30:27.989 --> 00:30:30.153
you begin to notice there is a mist that has gathered

795
00:30:30.153 --> 00:30:32.904
across the bottom of this forest,

796
00:30:32.904 --> 00:30:35.364
the closer you get to the bottom,

797
00:30:35.364 --> 00:30:39.614
and closer to the proximity of the lake's exterior.

798
00:30:41.386 --> 00:30:43.595
Traveling around what you had seen to be

799
00:30:43.595 --> 00:30:47.199
the southern side of it, you notice the mist

800
00:30:47.199 --> 00:30:52.199
start revealing shapes, and you think you see someone

801
00:30:52.337 --> 00:30:55.725
standing towards the edge of the lake

802
00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:57.589
as the treeline begins to thin,

803
00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.237
and you find yourself getting closer and closer

804
00:30:59.237 --> 00:31:02.329
to the edge of where this water begins.

805
00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:03.436
LAURA: Uh, guys.

806
00:31:03.436 --> 00:31:04.269
SAM: Hmm?

807
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:10.764
LAURA: Caduceus, you don't think there's anybody like,

808
00:31:10.764 --> 00:31:12.246
bad over here, do you?

809
00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:14.677
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't think so.

810
00:31:14.677 --> 00:31:16.544
I mean--
LAURA: Do you know so?

811
00:31:16.544 --> 00:31:18.927
TALIESIN: No, I mean,

812
00:31:18.927 --> 00:31:20.768
depends on what you mean by bad, really,

813
00:31:20.768 --> 00:31:23.512
sometimes it's just people with a different agenda--

814
00:31:23.512 --> 00:31:26.777
LAURA: People that will attack us, I mean, specifically.

815
00:31:26.777 --> 00:31:29.050
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean, that's not bad, just people,

816
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.542
everybody attacks us, and yeah, probably,

817
00:31:31.542 --> 00:31:33.522
if history's any indication, we'll probably

818
00:31:33.522 --> 00:31:34.524
get attacked, yeah.

819
00:31:34.524 --> 00:31:36.254
LIAM: Why don't we pretend like there might be people here

820
00:31:36.254 --> 00:31:37.667
who would attack us?

821
00:31:37.667 --> 00:31:40.837
LAURA: Okay, well in that case, I saw something in the mist.

822
00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:41.670
SAM: Where?

823
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.414
LAURA: Over at the lake, right in front of us.

824
00:31:43.414 --> 00:31:46.242
MARISHA: What's with figures in mist with us?

825
00:31:46.242 --> 00:31:49.114
TALIESIN: Oh, I mean, it's a lovely day,

826
00:31:49.114 --> 00:31:52.056
why wouldn't you be out in it?

827
00:31:52.056 --> 00:31:55.918
MARISHA: This smoke isn't toxic, by the way, is it?

828
00:31:55.918 --> 00:31:57.459
TALIESIN: I'm going to lick the air.

829
00:31:57.459 --> 00:31:58.701
MATT: Make a constitution check.

830
00:31:58.701 --> 00:32:00.567
TALIESIN: Cool.
SAM: Lick the air.

831
00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:01.792
TALIESIN: Oh no.

832
00:32:01.792 --> 00:32:02.723
MARISHA: Oh boy.

833
00:32:02.723 --> 00:32:03.970
TALIESIN: Save or check?

834
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.236
MATT: Save.

835
00:32:05.236 --> 00:32:06.237
TALIESIN: Six.

836
00:32:06.237 --> 00:32:07.233
MATT: Six.

837
00:32:07.233 --> 00:32:08.659
It's moisture.

838
00:32:08.659 --> 00:32:10.613
TALIESIN: All right, it's just, yeah.

839
00:32:10.613 --> 00:32:12.397
It doesn't taste like burning or anything, it's just--

840
00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:15.126
MATT: No, no, nothing odd, out of the ordinary,

841
00:32:15.126 --> 00:32:19.426
it is a cold moisture, it is

842
00:32:19.426 --> 00:32:22.056
just outside of the freezing point.

843
00:32:22.056 --> 00:32:23.664
TALIESIN: Okay.
MARISHA: I don't trust it.

844
00:32:23.664 --> 00:32:26.680
I put on like a makeshift face mask.

845
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.389
I take one of my extra sashes and--

846
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:32.246
TALIESIN: I'm going to remind everybody, as we move forward,

847
00:32:32.246 --> 00:32:35.385
that according to legends, that we're going to run into

848
00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:39.818
a group of people, similar belief system to my own,

849
00:32:39.818 --> 00:32:44.028
perhaps different, so we're expecting to see people.

850
00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:48.590
Maybe leading with our fist is not necessarily,

851
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.826
I'm not saying to take it off the table,

852
00:32:50.826 --> 00:32:53.889
but we're going to just try and come in for once

853
00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:56.886
and hope that perhaps we're being expected.

854
00:32:56.886 --> 00:32:59.224
LAURA: Should we like go out, like saying, "Oh hey,

855
00:32:59.224 --> 00:33:02.472
"Wildmother is the coolest," and stuff like that?

856
00:33:02.472 --> 00:33:04.189
TALIESIN: I wish you'd say that more often, actually.

857
00:33:04.189 --> 00:33:05.726
TRAVIS: Should we say their name?

858
00:33:05.726 --> 00:33:07.231
I forget the story you told.

859
00:33:07.231 --> 00:33:08.702
There was your family, the Clays,

860
00:33:08.702 --> 00:33:10.327
but there was also two others.

861
00:33:10.327 --> 00:33:11.661
LAURA: The Dusts and--

862
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:13.584
LIAM: And the Stones?

863
00:33:13.584 --> 00:33:15.785
LAURA and TALIESIN: This is Dust.

864
00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:16.618
TRAVIS: Dust.

865
00:33:20.922 --> 00:33:22.538
TALIESIN: The priest of Dust was the one who

866
00:33:22.538 --> 00:33:24.921
started the kiln.

867
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:26.392
TRAVIS: What was the third faction?

868
00:33:26.392 --> 00:33:28.108
TALIESIN: Stone.
TRAVIS: Stone, okay.

869
00:33:28.108 --> 00:33:31.116
TALIESIN: Started the Menagerie.

870
00:33:31.116 --> 00:33:33.990
That's somewhere else.

871
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.095
LAURA: Is that on the coast?

872
00:33:36.095 --> 00:33:37.409
TALIESIN: Possibly.

873
00:33:37.409 --> 00:33:40.718
LIAM: Is there some old word, some old name for it?

874
00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:42.616
Or is it just whatever word is being used

875
00:33:42.616 --> 00:33:45.016
for Dust these days?

876
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.037
TALIESIN: Well, we were called the Clays

877
00:33:48.037 --> 00:33:49.146
and always have been,

878
00:33:49.146 --> 00:33:51.417
so I have to just assume that the Dusts

879
00:33:51.417 --> 00:33:53.355
have always been the Dusts.

880
00:33:53.355 --> 00:33:57.831
I don't know, the stories don't say if they were,

881
00:33:57.831 --> 00:33:59.649
they don't call them brothers,

882
00:33:59.649 --> 00:34:01.052
they don't say they were related,

883
00:34:01.052 --> 00:34:02.298
I couldn't tell you what they look like,

884
00:34:02.298 --> 00:34:04.724
or where they come from other than the fact

885
00:34:04.724 --> 00:34:09.724
three families all were at one point together,

886
00:34:09.926 --> 00:34:13.993
and obviously, friends

887
00:34:13.993 --> 00:34:15.659
and compatriots.

888
00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.408
LAURA: And lovers.

889
00:34:17.408 --> 00:34:20.000
TRAVIS: Okay, Jessie, just--

890
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.669
TALIESIN: Your mind.
TRAVIS: Pace it.

891
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:22.538
SAM: They could be.

892
00:34:22.538 --> 00:34:23.475
LAURA: They could've been.

893
00:34:23.475 --> 00:34:25.000
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Well, could be.

894
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.385
LAURA: Just a big orgy of Clay and Dust and Stone!

895
00:34:28.385 --> 00:34:32.468
TRAVIS: The mist is getting to you a little quick here.

896
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.738
TALIESIN: But, yeah.

897
00:34:37.944 --> 00:34:39.499
I don't know what to expect.

898
00:34:39.499 --> 00:34:42.690
I know that there's a dozen names for the place I come from,

899
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:46.556
and I've heard a couple different names for this place.

900
00:34:46.556 --> 00:34:48.666
TRAVIS: Any identifying features,

901
00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:51.512
or call and repeat that you guys might share?

902
00:34:51.512 --> 00:34:56.452
TALIESIN: I would hope they would know the name Clay.

903
00:34:56.452 --> 00:34:57.288
TRAVIS: Sure.

904
00:34:57.288 --> 00:34:59.183
LIAM: You are the most well-informed of us to this,

905
00:34:59.183 --> 00:35:01.425
so I think we all trust you.

906
00:35:01.425 --> 00:35:03.045
LAURA: What is the figure doing?

907
00:35:03.045 --> 00:35:04.019
TALIESIN: Have faith.
MATT: Currently,

908
00:35:04.019 --> 00:35:05.719
it looks like it's standing on the banks,

909
00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:07.025
looking out across the lake.
LAURA: It's just standing there?

910
00:35:07.025 --> 00:35:07.858
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Why don't I go

911
00:35:07.858 --> 00:35:09.440
snoop around, just see what it is?

912
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.799
LAURA: Why don't we just call out to it?

913
00:35:10.799 --> 00:35:12.348
SAM: What if it's got friends?

914
00:35:12.348 --> 00:35:14.478
TALIESIN: I almost did, I was just trying to be polite,

915
00:35:14.478 --> 00:35:16.601
because I know that makes everybody nervous when I do that.

916
00:35:16.601 --> 00:35:19.314
LAURA: I mean, we haven't been super quiet walking up,

917
00:35:19.314 --> 00:35:21.673
and it looks like his back is to us, so.

918
00:35:21.673 --> 00:35:23.618
TRAVIS: Whatever you want to do.

919
00:35:23.618 --> 00:35:26.631
TALIESIN: Let's just keep heading in that direction,

920
00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:28.515
and we won't try and be particularly sneaky about it,

921
00:35:28.515 --> 00:35:29.770
we'll just--

922
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.527
SAM: I'm going to try to be particularly sneaky.

923
00:35:32.527 --> 00:35:33.360
MATT: Okay.

924
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.843
SAM: I'm going to dart off to the side, into the mist.

925
00:35:35.843 --> 00:35:38.896
MATT: Make a stealth check.
SAM: Okay.

926
00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:40.980
With my hood up.

927
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.096
Ooh, not great.

928
00:35:42.096 --> 00:35:43.649
Okay, 21.

929
00:35:43.649 --> 00:35:44.482
MATT: 21, okay.

930
00:35:44.482 --> 00:35:45.673
LIAM: A low roll for a rogue.
TALIESIN: "Not great."

931
00:35:45.673 --> 00:35:46.871
I know.

932
00:35:46.871 --> 00:35:49.432
MATT: Nott darts off into the nearby forest,

933
00:35:49.432 --> 00:35:52.888
you guys continue heading towards the edge of the lake?

934
00:35:52.888 --> 00:35:55.443
MARISHA: I'm actually going to see Nott do that

935
00:35:55.443 --> 00:35:57.217
and peel off and do the same.

936
00:35:57.217 --> 00:35:58.463
MATT: Make a stealth check.

937
00:35:58.463 --> 00:36:00.998
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly, just since we're walking,

938
00:36:00.998 --> 00:36:03.828
I'm going to just talk to the trees for a second.

939
00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:06.106
You guys would let us know if there was anything

940
00:36:06.106 --> 00:36:07.944
ominous or suspicious coming up, right?

941
00:36:07.944 --> 00:36:10.750
I mean, you know, I feel like we're at that point.

942
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.895
MATT: You figure the trees probably understood you.

943
00:36:12.895 --> 00:36:14.670
TALIESIN: They seem to nod.

944
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.033
Or it could be wind, I don't know.

945
00:36:16.033 --> 00:36:17.284
MATT: It's probably the wind.

946
00:36:17.284 --> 00:36:18.683
(laughter)

947
00:36:18.683 --> 00:36:19.638
TALIESIN: We have an understanding.

948
00:36:19.638 --> 00:36:20.836
LIAM: It's probably fine.

949
00:36:20.836 --> 00:36:21.916
I cast Mage Armor.

950
00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:22.791
MATT: Okay.

951
00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:24.205
(laughter)

952
00:36:24.205 --> 00:36:26.690
A shimmer of arcane energy briefly apparates

953
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.485
around the exterior of Caleb's body and then vanishes.

954
00:36:29.485 --> 00:36:31.378
TALIESIN: Strive for peace, prepare for war, I'm well aware.

955
00:36:31.378 --> 00:36:32.942
TALIESIN: All right. I'm with ya.

956
00:36:32.942 --> 00:36:34.312
MARISHA: 25 on my stealth roll.

957
00:36:34.312 --> 00:36:35.337
MATT: 25, nice.

958
00:36:35.337 --> 00:36:36.615
You both peel off to the sides

959
00:36:36.615 --> 00:36:37.805
and begin to approach the edge.

960
00:36:37.805 --> 00:36:41.139
Now because, you guys are traveling at a casual pace?

961
00:36:41.139 --> 00:36:42.910
You guys are keeping up with them in tandem,

962
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.661
but off to the side, hidden.

963
00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:46.096
You approach the edge.

964
00:36:46.096 --> 00:36:48.545
Since Jester pointed it out, you can see the shape.

965
00:36:48.545 --> 00:36:50.561
The closer you get, you see it looks to be female.

966
00:36:50.561 --> 00:36:55.551
You can see long, straight hair, going past shoulders.

967
00:36:55.551 --> 00:36:57.395
I don't know if they're fishing off the edge of the lake.

968
00:36:57.395 --> 00:36:59.090
You can't really see what their activity is.

969
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.029
They're, you know, just

970
00:37:00.029 --> 00:37:03.353
looking out over the waters.

971
00:37:03.353 --> 00:37:05.732
As you get close, those of you who are not being stealthy,

972
00:37:05.732 --> 00:37:07.401
making your way through the snow.

973
00:37:07.401 --> 00:37:08.756
(crunching)

974
00:37:08.756 --> 00:37:09.880
Footfalls.

975
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.532
The figure turns and looks towards you,

976
00:37:12.532 --> 00:37:15.465
the vacant dark eyes,

977
00:37:15.465 --> 00:37:18.637
the sockets where they should be,

978
00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:19.823
glancing in your direction,

979
00:37:19.823 --> 00:37:22.325
the hair seems to almost lift,

980
00:37:22.325 --> 00:37:23.591
and it vanishes into the mist.

981
00:37:23.591 --> 00:37:25.534
LAURA: Oh, she was bad, that's bad guy, that's bad guy.

982
00:37:25.534 --> 00:37:26.698
TALIESIN: All right, that's bad.

983
00:37:26.698 --> 00:37:29.458
I'm going to do a quick Detect Undead.

984
00:37:29.458 --> 00:37:30.974
TRAVIS: But the music's still fine, we're okay.

985
00:37:30.974 --> 00:37:32.941
LAURA: I'm backing up away from the mist.

986
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:34.222
TALIESIN: Okay, you were right.

987
00:37:34.222 --> 00:37:35.556
I admit it, you were right.

988
00:37:35.556 --> 00:37:38.141
TALIESIN: She disappeared into the lake, over the lake?

989
00:37:38.141 --> 00:37:40.107
MATT: Like her form just vanished into the mist.

990
00:37:40.107 --> 00:37:42.532
LAURA: Did she look at us scary, or did she just look at us

991
00:37:42.532 --> 00:37:43.479
vacantly?

992
00:37:43.479 --> 00:37:45.766
MATT: Just like a...

993
00:37:45.766 --> 00:37:48.567
LAURA: Oh, I don't like it, I don't like it.

994
00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:50.091
TRAVIS: Why this campaign?

995
00:37:50.091 --> 00:37:52.629
Can't it just be some brutish ogre instead of scary shit

996
00:37:52.629 --> 00:37:55.012
that's going to make me wake up in the middle of the night?

997
00:37:55.012 --> 00:37:56.545
LIAM: Nope, it can only be that.

998
00:37:56.545 --> 00:37:57.378
TALIESIN: Just think about last night,

999
00:37:57.378 --> 00:37:59.053
everything will be fine.

1000
00:38:00.467 --> 00:38:01.300
MATT: So?

1001
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.380
TALIESIN: Yeah, Detect Undead?

1002
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.216
MATT: All right.

1003
00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:06.693
The radius on that is?

1004
00:38:06.693 --> 00:38:09.641
TALIESIN: Is 60 feet.
MATT: 60 feet.

1005
00:38:09.641 --> 00:38:11.456
TALIESIN: For the next you know, few seconds,

1006
00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:14.285
I get like a good six seconds of, yeah.

1007
00:38:14.285 --> 00:38:19.285
MATT: As you focus, the exterior of your radius

1008
00:38:20.249 --> 00:38:22.335
suddenly catches your attention

1009
00:38:22.335 --> 00:38:23.489
to the right and left,

1010
00:38:23.489 --> 00:38:28.444
and then pulls beyond your perspective range.

1011
00:38:28.444 --> 00:38:30.657
TALIESIN: We are in trouble, guys.

1012
00:38:30.657 --> 00:38:32.240
SAM: We're in trouble.

1013
00:38:33.529 --> 00:38:36.000
MATT: You are no longer stealthed.

1014
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.925
SAM: I hide again.

1015
00:38:36.925 --> 00:38:38.207
MATT: Okay.

1016
00:38:38.207 --> 00:38:39.824
LAURA: No.

1017
00:38:39.824 --> 00:38:44.174
TALIESIN: I am full, we're going to...

1018
00:38:45.162 --> 00:38:47.622
TRAVIS: Not happy fun times anymore?

1019
00:38:47.622 --> 00:38:50.006
TALIESIN: Nope, nope, you were right.

1020
00:38:50.006 --> 00:38:51.006
TRAVIS: Wasn't me.

1021
00:38:54.439 --> 00:38:55.536
TALIESIN: Quiet.

1022
00:38:55.536 --> 00:38:57.036
Is there anything?

1023
00:38:58.997 --> 00:39:01.164
MATT: Make a perception check.

1024
00:39:02.616 --> 00:39:04.099
TALIESIN: I want my real-- No, that'll do.

1025
00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:05.275
LAURA: That's good.

1026
00:39:05.275 --> 00:39:06.108
TALIESIN: 28.

1027
00:39:06.108 --> 00:39:07.675
MATT: 28.

1028
00:39:07.675 --> 00:39:09.888
Looking around you, like the mist is thick here

1029
00:39:09.888 --> 00:39:13.986
at the base of the valley, and looking just beyond

1030
00:39:13.986 --> 00:39:18.156
where the water is, you see like shapes occasionally move,

1031
00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:21.555
like a hand or a shoulder, and you glance off

1032
00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:25.326
to the back, and Fjord, you follow Caduceus' eyes

1033
00:39:25.326 --> 00:39:28.311
and glance over as you see another figure

1034
00:39:28.311 --> 00:39:29.657
just looking at the edge of the mist

1035
00:39:29.657 --> 00:39:31.632
and then steps backward and vanishes again.

1036
00:39:31.632 --> 00:39:33.564
TRAVIS: How far are we from the water's edge?

1037
00:39:33.564 --> 00:39:36.786
MATT: At this point, you're about 50, 60 feet.

1038
00:39:36.786 --> 00:39:38.544
LAURA: We're not in the mist yet.

1039
00:39:38.544 --> 00:39:40.358
MATT: Well, the mist surrounds all of you.

1040
00:39:40.358 --> 00:39:43.590
LAURA: Oh fuck, I thought we were like outside of it.

1041
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.173
TALIESIN: There is...

1042
00:39:46.173 --> 00:39:48.442
TRAVIS: Anybody feel like this mist is unnatural?

1043
00:39:48.442 --> 00:39:49.892
TALIESIN: I would think this mist is

1044
00:39:49.892 --> 00:39:51.017
part of the problem, yes.

1045
00:39:51.017 --> 00:39:52.749
Or perhaps the lake is part of the problem.

1046
00:39:52.749 --> 00:39:55.269
TRAVIS: Do we need to get across this lake?

1047
00:39:55.269 --> 00:39:57.340
TALIESIN: Do we have to get across this lake?

1048
00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.280
MATT: You can attempt to go across it or go around it.

1049
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.529
TALIESIN: I was hoping we were going to go around it.

1050
00:40:01.529 --> 00:40:04.217
SAM: Our destination is on the other side?
MATT: On the other side of this lake.

1051
00:40:04.217 --> 00:40:06.968
TALIESIN: Can never be easy, can it?

1052
00:40:06.968 --> 00:40:08.721
SAM: Like a submarine?

1053
00:40:08.721 --> 00:40:11.434
TRAVIS: No, we could go in the lake and through.

1054
00:40:11.434 --> 00:40:14.329
MARISHA: How far across is the lake?

1055
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:16.695
MATT: From one side to the other, I'd say

1056
00:40:16.695 --> 00:40:19.080
SAM: We could ride on you.
TRAVIS: We can breathe underwater.

1057
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.726
TALIESIN: I'm not opposed.
MATT: -- it's about--

1058
00:40:21.726 --> 00:40:23.267
TRAVIS: You want to?

1059
00:40:23.267 --> 00:40:24.562
TALIESIN: I think I do.

1060
00:40:24.562 --> 00:40:26.254
MATT: About a half mile.

1061
00:40:26.254 --> 00:40:28.400
MARISHA: Half a mile?
TRAVIS: Half a mile across the lake?

1062
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.965
MATT: Half a mile across the lake to about a mile,
somewhere in the neighborhood.

1063
00:40:30.965 --> 00:40:34.666
TRAVIS: I will cast Underwater Breathing
on the entire group.

1064
00:40:34.666 --> 00:40:36.742
SAM: I've got an issue with this, guys.

1065
00:40:36.742 --> 00:40:38.219
I still have an issue with this.

1066
00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:40.415
TALIESIN: It's okay, we can just knock you out,
it'll be all right.

1067
00:40:40.415 --> 00:40:41.788
SAM: What do you mean knock me out?

1068
00:40:41.788 --> 00:40:43.080
LAURA: We're not going to knock you out, Nott.

1069
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.344
We're not going to do that.

1070
00:40:44.344 --> 00:40:45.644
MARISHA: It's going to be like bath water.

1071
00:40:45.644 --> 00:40:46.727
It'll be like a day at the spa.

1072
00:40:46.727 --> 00:40:47.911
SAM: I'll just walk on the water.

1073
00:40:47.911 --> 00:40:51.063
TALIESIN: My parents always said it's just best
to sleep through these things.

1074
00:40:51.063 --> 00:40:54.196
LAURA: What if the whole lake is filled with dead people?

1075
00:40:54.196 --> 00:40:56.185
TALIESIN: We'll find out.
TRAVIS: Then we'll come back out.

1076
00:40:56.185 --> 00:40:58.081
LAURA: What if they grab us and we can't get out?

1077
00:40:58.081 --> 00:41:00.013
TALIESIN: Then you'll cast Turn Undead, it'll be okay.

1078
00:41:00.013 --> 00:41:01.357
LAURA: Oh, that's right, I can do that.

1079
00:41:01.357 --> 00:41:02.410
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to be okay.

1080
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.709
LIAM: Also, sometimes you can find water

1081
00:41:04.709 --> 00:41:07.778
out in the wild that boils the flesh off of the bone.

1082
00:41:07.778 --> 00:41:09.219
SAM: Are you serious right now?

1083
00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:12.011
TRAVIS: Stop reading so many books, shit. Let's go.

1084
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:13.670
LIAM: So don't jump in.

1085
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:15.380
TALIESIN: We'll dip a toe in.

1086
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.427
TRAVIS: I'll walk in.

1087
00:41:16.427 --> 00:41:17.761
I'll walk in the water.

1088
00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:19.599
LAURA: Just put your finger in, Fjord!

1089
00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:20.638
TALIESIN: Let's just do it.

1090
00:41:20.638 --> 00:41:23.569
MATT: You walk in, your foot hits the edge, and slips.

1091
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:26.521
It is an icy, frozen surface.

1092
00:41:26.521 --> 00:41:28.160
TRAVIS: Cool, glad I cast Underwater Breathing.

1093
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.688
MARISHA: (laughing)

1094
00:41:29.688 --> 00:41:31.204
LAURA: Maybe we could cut a hole in the ice.

1095
00:41:31.204 --> 00:41:33.038
SAM: It's solid? Excellent.
TRAVIS: Might as well try it.

1096
00:41:33.038 --> 00:41:35.146
I'll summon the falchion and just go shink

1097
00:41:35.146 --> 00:41:36.862
and see if it even goes through or not.

1098
00:41:36.862 --> 00:41:38.432
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a strength check for me.

1099
00:41:38.432 --> 00:41:40.737
TALIESIN: I am keeping my eyes bloody peeled.

1100
00:41:40.737 --> 00:41:42.460
TRAVIS: You said a strength check.

1101
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.121
MATT: Well, it is your weapon, so I'd say you can use

1102
00:41:45.121 --> 00:41:47.027
your charisma bonus in place of a strength check

1103
00:41:47.027 --> 00:41:48.510
for this one.
TRAVIS: Oh, bless you, sir.

1104
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.846
MARISHA: Charm that ice.

1105
00:41:49.846 --> 00:41:50.945
Ooh.
TRAVIS: Eight.

1106
00:41:50.945 --> 00:41:51.999
MATT: Eight.
MARISHA: Shit.

1107
00:41:51.999 --> 00:41:54.196
MATT: It sinks about two inches into it

1108
00:41:54.196 --> 00:41:55.746
and then wedges itself there.

1109
00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:57.762
You look cool putting it in.

1110
00:41:57.762 --> 00:41:59.183
(grunting)
TALIESIN: I cast Sacred Flame.

1111
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.513
MATT: You have to kind of-- (squeaking)

1112
00:42:00.513 --> 00:42:01.785
LAURA: Do you want me to help?

1113
00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.960
TALIESIN: I cast Sacred Flame on the point he hit,

1114
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.352
just to try and melt it a bit.

1115
00:42:05.352 --> 00:42:07.723
LAURA: I'm going to try to shove the falchion down further

1116
00:42:07.723 --> 00:42:09.284
and see if I can get through the ice.

1117
00:42:09.284 --> 00:42:11.764
MATT: Okay, so as you're about to wedge it out and lift,

1118
00:42:11.764 --> 00:42:13.487
Jester reaches over and puts her hands over yours,

1119
00:42:13.487 --> 00:42:15.187
and roll a strength check.

1120
00:42:17.965 --> 00:42:20.884
LAURA: Oh, ballsy balls balls.
TALIESIN: (groaning)

1121
00:42:20.884 --> 00:42:21.717
LAURA: Six.

1122
00:42:21.717 --> 00:42:22.601
MATT: Six.

1123
00:42:22.601 --> 00:42:24.598
LAURA: This falchion is not very--

1124
00:42:24.598 --> 00:42:26.629
MATT: You both just wiggle it back and forth a bit

1125
00:42:26.629 --> 00:42:28.943
before eventually having to pull it free.

1126
00:42:28.943 --> 00:42:31.813
LIAM: Caleb sighs and then just points six feet away

1127
00:42:31.813 --> 00:42:34.686
and starts doing concentrated Fire Bolts into one spot.

1128
00:42:34.686 --> 00:42:36.372
MATT: Right, and you're doing Sacred Flame as well,

1129
00:42:36.372 --> 00:42:37.779
which is more of a radiant burst.

1130
00:42:37.779 --> 00:42:41.011
The flames that burn there tend to be more of a

1131
00:42:41.011 --> 00:42:43.742
life-force affecting element.

1132
00:42:43.742 --> 00:42:47.068
Yours does warm it a bit, but the fierceness

1133
00:42:47.068 --> 00:42:48.908
of the arcane Fire Bolt continuously--

1134
00:42:48.908 --> 00:42:51.983
you're watching shards of ice go (small explosions)

1135
00:42:51.983 --> 00:42:54.601
with each impact, and begin to melt away a bit, until--

1136
00:42:54.601 --> 00:42:57.576
it takes you about, I'd say two minutes or so

1137
00:42:57.576 --> 00:42:59.216
to finally break through the ice

1138
00:42:59.216 --> 00:43:01.032
to get to the water beneath it.

1139
00:43:01.032 --> 00:43:02.163
TALIESIN: Do we want light underwater?

1140
00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:04.654
LIAM: Everyone has a specialty.
TRAVIS: I would think so.

1141
00:43:04.654 --> 00:43:07.049
MATT: The ice itself's only about maybe

1142
00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:08.523
an inch and a half thick.

1143
00:43:08.523 --> 00:43:10.316
It's not super, super thick.

1144
00:43:10.316 --> 00:43:12.261
MARISHA: Are we going to freeze to death down there?

1145
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:13.219
SAM: Yes.

1146
00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:14.802
Of course we are.

1147
00:43:14.802 --> 00:43:15.917
Super cold.

1148
00:43:15.917 --> 00:43:18.714
LIAM: I think most of us, maybe not you, maybe.

1149
00:43:18.714 --> 00:43:21.635
TALIESIN: I'm going to touch the water, how's it feel?

1150
00:43:21.635 --> 00:43:22.643
MATT: Very cold.

1151
00:43:22.643 --> 00:43:23.795
LIAM: Terrible.
MATT: Very cold.

1152
00:43:23.795 --> 00:43:25.203
TALIESIN: How far away are we from the point at which

1153
00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:26.578
the lava hits the water?

1154
00:43:26.578 --> 00:43:28.284
MATT: It's the opposite side of this lake,

1155
00:43:28.284 --> 00:43:30.438
because that's where the different vents are leaking.

1156
00:43:30.438 --> 00:43:32.522
So about a half a mile to a mile.

1157
00:43:32.522 --> 00:43:35.240
TALIESIN: We could also always just-- hmm.

1158
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.998
LAURA: What's all the dead people mist doing?

1159
00:43:37.998 --> 00:43:40.445
MATT: As you glance around,

1160
00:43:40.445 --> 00:43:42.523
you look over your shoulder, and right there

1161
00:43:42.523 --> 00:43:46.449
next to your face, you see the gaunt skeletal visage

1162
00:43:46.449 --> 00:43:49.738
of the eyeless woman, her stringy hair,

1163
00:43:49.738 --> 00:43:52.908
like very Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.

1164
00:43:52.908 --> 00:43:54.395
TRAVIS: Nope.
LAURA: Oh god!

1165
00:43:54.395 --> 00:43:55.911
MATT: Looking over your shoulder

1166
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:57.728
and then looks back into your face,

1167
00:43:57.728 --> 00:44:00.519
and then vanishes in the mist.

1168
00:44:00.519 --> 00:44:02.378
TALIESIN: Can we not right now?
TRAVIS: They're not fucking with us,

1169
00:44:02.378 --> 00:44:04.138
though.

1170
00:44:04.138 --> 00:44:05.824
MARISHA: Maybe they're just curious ghosts.

1171
00:44:05.824 --> 00:44:06.958
TRAVIS: Could be just--

1172
00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:09.112
TALIESIN: I'm talking to the ghosts.
MATT: What'd you say?

1173
00:44:09.112 --> 00:44:11.187
Can we not right now?

1174
00:44:11.187 --> 00:44:12.456
MATT: Okay.

1175
00:44:12.456 --> 00:44:14.289
TALIESIN: Just hoping.

1176
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:18.317
You have goggles, can you see underwater

1177
00:44:18.317 --> 00:44:20.632
if we put your head under and hold you?

1178
00:44:20.632 --> 00:44:22.764
SAM: Yeah, why don't we put Beau's head

1179
00:44:22.764 --> 00:44:24.368
under freezing water for a while?

1180
00:44:24.368 --> 00:44:27.402
TRAVIS: It was my idea, I can do it, I'll go.

1181
00:44:27.402 --> 00:44:30.304
TALIESIN: Don't-- yeah, just take a look,
don't stay down there.

1182
00:44:30.304 --> 00:44:33.061
TRAVIS: I'll put my hands on the ice and stick my head under

1183
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:34.844
and see what I can see with my darkvision.

1184
00:44:34.844 --> 00:44:37.069
MATT: Make a perception check.
TRAVIS: Okay.

1185
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:39.530
SAM: Give him some light, Caleb.

1186
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:40.729
LIAM: I could do that, couldn't I?

1187
00:44:40.729 --> 00:44:42.109
TALIESIN: I'll stick my-- I can-- oh yeah, go ahead.

1188
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:43.151
TRAVIS: 17.

1189
00:44:43.151 --> 00:44:44.387
MATT: 17, okay.

1190
00:44:44.387 --> 00:44:46.887
You poke your head down. It is murky water,

1191
00:44:46.887 --> 00:44:48.555
and a lot of the light that would come in,

1192
00:44:48.555 --> 00:44:50.600
while there is a storm above, is being refracted

1193
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.406
by the thick ice, so visibility is not great.

1194
00:44:53.406 --> 00:44:56.099
LIAM: While he's down there, globules into the water

1195
00:44:56.099 --> 00:44:56.986
around his head.

1196
00:44:56.986 --> 00:44:57.861
MATT: Okay.

1197
00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:59.108
As they do, it lights up.

1198
00:44:59.108 --> 00:45:04.103
You can see the muck that makes up the base of this lake.

1199
00:45:04.103 --> 00:45:08.120
The dirt and bits of sand and sediment

1200
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:12.220
that turns into the thick,

1201
00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.336
rotting vegetative material

1202
00:45:14.336 --> 00:45:17.243
that has just settled to the bottom of the water.

1203
00:45:17.243 --> 00:45:20.526
About 30, 40 or so feet out, you can see some rocks

1204
00:45:20.526 --> 00:45:22.333
and you can see a little bit of vegetation

1205
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:23.681
that lives beneath, but nothing beyond that

1206
00:45:23.681 --> 00:45:25.566
catches your attention.

1207
00:45:25.566 --> 00:45:27.878
TRAVIS: Okay, and pop my head back up.

1208
00:45:27.878 --> 00:45:29.886
Visibility's not terrible.

1209
00:45:29.886 --> 00:45:31.769
It's not polluted, I didn't see any creatures

1210
00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:33.701
swimming around, just seems to be a fresh water--

1211
00:45:33.701 --> 00:45:36.839
could I tell if it was fresh water?
MATT: It is fresh water.

1212
00:45:36.839 --> 00:45:38.924
TRAVIS: Seems like a fresh water lake.

1213
00:45:38.924 --> 00:45:40.804
LAURA: What is it, Caduceus?

1214
00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:44.393
TALIESIN: I was just thinking that in theory

1215
00:45:44.393 --> 00:45:49.326
the kiln is in that mountain, which is in turn a crematory,

1216
00:45:49.326 --> 00:45:53.793
which in turn means that the cremated remains

1217
00:45:53.793 --> 00:45:57.667
of hundreds people might be rolling into this lake.

1218
00:45:57.667 --> 00:45:59.509
LAURA: Oh, hence all the ghosts?

1219
00:45:59.509 --> 00:46:00.441
TALIESIN: Maybe.

1220
00:46:00.441 --> 00:46:02.749
MARISHA: I tighten my scarf around my face.

1221
00:46:02.749 --> 00:46:05.803
TALIESIN: That also means that maybe
inside the lake might be worse.

1222
00:46:05.803 --> 00:46:06.636
TRAVIS: Sure.

1223
00:46:06.636 --> 00:46:08.903
I mean, they haven't messed with us yet.
TALIESIN: They haven't.

1224
00:46:08.903 --> 00:46:10.403
SAM: We could just go.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1225
00:46:10.403 --> 00:46:14.303
TALIESIN: Let's just walk

1226
00:46:14.303 --> 00:46:16.369
carefully with our eyes--
SAM: Around the lake?

1227
00:46:16.369 --> 00:46:17.529
TALIESIN: Around.

1228
00:46:17.529 --> 00:46:18.983
Around or across?

1229
00:46:18.983 --> 00:46:20.611
TRAVIS: I think straight through.

1230
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.607
I mean, I think around it's still there,

1231
00:46:22.607 --> 00:46:24.268
the mist's still there, right?

1232
00:46:24.268 --> 00:46:27.893
MATT: The mist permeates the entirety of this basin

1233
00:46:27.893 --> 00:46:30.213
and the base of this valley.

1234
00:46:30.213 --> 00:46:32.102
TALIESIN: Normally I would say that we were

1235
00:46:32.102 --> 00:46:33.788
less likely to get attacked from below

1236
00:46:33.788 --> 00:46:35.288
if we don't walk across the lake,

1237
00:46:35.288 --> 00:46:37.451
except the trouble with undead is that

1238
00:46:37.451 --> 00:46:39.922
sometimes below is where they come from.

1239
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:42.597
TRAVIS: Sure, let's go around.
TALIESIN: I guess we'll go around.

1240
00:46:42.597 --> 00:46:43.607
LAURA: Okay.

1241
00:46:43.607 --> 00:46:46.068
TALIESIN: Let's keep our eyes peeled.

1242
00:46:46.068 --> 00:46:48.678
MATT: So you're walking around the outskirts of the lake.

1243
00:46:48.678 --> 00:46:49.878
TALIESIN: I think around.

1244
00:46:49.878 --> 00:46:53.359
SAM: Would it add much to the time?

1245
00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:54.709
MATT: It will.

1246
00:46:56.528 --> 00:47:01.528
I'd say at a careful pace, that's another hour or so.

1247
00:47:01.529 --> 00:47:03.638
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: That's not so bad.

1248
00:47:04.587 --> 00:47:05.857
SAM: Are we in danger of not making it

1249
00:47:05.857 --> 00:47:07.763
by nightfall or something?

1250
00:47:07.763 --> 00:47:09.851
LIAM: You said a couple of hours when we arrive--

1251
00:47:09.851 --> 00:47:11.556
MATT: You have a few more hours before you lose daylight.

1252
00:47:11.556 --> 00:47:13.271
The storm is coming and it's getting darker

1253
00:47:13.271 --> 00:47:14.245
and it's getting colder.

1254
00:47:14.245 --> 00:47:16.276
At this point too, since you put your head in the water,

1255
00:47:16.276 --> 00:47:19.551
the water that's on your face, and the elements of your hair

1256
00:47:19.551 --> 00:47:21.352
are starting to frost and freeze,

1257
00:47:21.352 --> 00:47:24.830
and your head is already starting to get chillier

1258
00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:26.744
than it was before.

1259
00:47:26.744 --> 00:47:29.393
TRAVIS: Out of the water's probably better.

1260
00:47:29.393 --> 00:47:32.856
LAURA: Oh, Beau, take the rod and put it on Fjord's head.

1261
00:47:32.856 --> 00:47:34.777
TRAVIS: No no, it's just a rod, it's fine.

1262
00:47:34.777 --> 00:47:35.610
(exhaling)

1263
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.394
(laughing)

1264
00:47:37.394 --> 00:47:38.844
LAURA: Is that better?
TRAVIS: That's nice, yeah.

1265
00:47:38.844 --> 00:47:41.221
LIAM: That's a look.

1266
00:47:41.221 --> 00:47:42.054
MATT: Okay.

1267
00:47:42.054 --> 00:47:43.801
TALIESIN: Eyes are peeled this whole walk.

1268
00:47:43.801 --> 00:47:44.953
MATT: Fair enough.

1269
00:47:44.953 --> 00:47:46.625
Same marching order as previously?

1270
00:47:46.625 --> 00:47:47.458
SAM: Sure.

1271
00:47:47.458 --> 00:47:48.988
LAURA: Sure.
MATT: Okay.

1272
00:47:48.988 --> 00:47:51.015
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for that

1273
00:47:51.015 --> 00:47:52.374
chick that was at my shoulder.

1274
00:47:52.374 --> 00:47:53.353
MATT: All right.

1275
00:47:53.353 --> 00:47:55.851
You guys continue going to the right or the left,

1276
00:47:55.851 --> 00:47:58.082
or what would be the eastern or western sides of this lake?

1277
00:47:58.082 --> 00:47:59.105
TRAVIS: Left.

1278
00:47:59.105 --> 00:48:00.438
MATT: Left, all right, so.

1279
00:48:00.438 --> 00:48:03.434
Curving around, as you move away, watching behind,

1280
00:48:03.434 --> 00:48:06.477
you can see that area where the ice has been broken

1281
00:48:06.477 --> 00:48:08.732
and melted a bit, you can see the mist seems to

1282
00:48:08.732 --> 00:48:10.561
swirl over it, and as it does,

1283
00:48:10.561 --> 00:48:13.014
you can see hands reaching down

1284
00:48:13.014 --> 00:48:16.541
towards it, and the ice (creaking)

1285
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:19.602
forms back over the area where you had removed it.

1286
00:48:19.602 --> 00:48:23.066
As it does, you can see a face look up

1287
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.180
and then disappear into the mist.

1288
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.818
You turn around to look ahead of you,

1289
00:48:26.818 --> 00:48:29.019
and you see, about 30 or 40 feet ahead of you,

1290
00:48:29.019 --> 00:48:31.251
another figure just keeping at pace,

1291
00:48:31.251 --> 00:48:32.733
but drifting backwards.

1292
00:48:32.733 --> 00:48:35.182
This one appears male, eyes missing,

1293
00:48:35.182 --> 00:48:38.253
wispy hair slightly drifting

1294
00:48:38.253 --> 00:48:40.823
and floating in the space, and it just glances

1295
00:48:40.823 --> 00:48:41.860
in your direction for a moment

1296
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.653
before it turns around and then-- (whooshes)

1297
00:48:44.653 --> 00:48:45.947
dissipates into the mist as well.

1298
00:48:45.947 --> 00:48:48.550
LIAM: Are we walking through snow?

1299
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.273
MATT: There is snow on the banks of this lake, yeah.

1300
00:48:50.273 --> 00:48:52.501
LIAM: Is it like, six inches, an inch, a foot?

1301
00:48:52.501 --> 00:48:55.480
MATT: For right now, it's maybe two inches,

1302
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.966
and it's a little slushy at the edge of the lake right here.

1303
00:48:58.966 --> 00:49:01.202
More and more is coming down,

1304
00:49:01.202 --> 00:49:02.769
and you gather probably by the time you make

1305
00:49:02.769 --> 00:49:05.177
the other side of the lake, you'll probably have--

1306
00:49:05.177 --> 00:49:06.579
TRAVIS: I don't want to point out the obvious,

1307
00:49:06.579 --> 00:49:09.098
but you saw it cover up the hole, right?

1308
00:49:09.098 --> 00:49:13.088
Like, why would it care if there was a hole if--

1309
00:49:13.088 --> 00:49:14.532
TALIESIN: It's probably for the best that we didn't go in.

1310
00:49:14.532 --> 00:49:15.494
LAURA: Yeah.

1311
00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:16.327
TRAVIS: Or maybe--

1312
00:49:16.327 --> 00:49:19.143
SAM: Maybe it's just cold weather.

1313
00:49:20.155 --> 00:49:21.997
LAURA: Should we just like, talk to the ghosts

1314
00:49:21.997 --> 00:49:23.919
and let them know that, you know--

1315
00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:26.480
SAM: That we're okay?
LAURA: We're nice.

1316
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.452
LIAM: It's curious, but that's probably not

1317
00:49:28.452 --> 00:49:30.392
the first place we should look.

1318
00:49:30.392 --> 00:49:32.152
TRAVIS: Right.

1319
00:49:32.152 --> 00:49:34.692
Well Jester, you're very affable,

1320
00:49:34.692 --> 00:49:37.275
why don't you give 'em a whirl?

1321
00:49:38.511 --> 00:49:39.344
LAURA: Oh--

1322
00:49:40.202 --> 00:49:41.727
hey ghosts.

1323
00:49:41.727 --> 00:49:43.517
SAM: (laughing)

1324
00:49:43.517 --> 00:49:46.594
LAURA: Don't know how long you've been here, but you know,

1325
00:49:46.594 --> 00:49:50.709
it's pretty remote, so if you want to hear about stuff

1326
00:49:50.709 --> 00:49:55.209
going on in the world, we can let you know.

1327
00:49:55.209 --> 00:49:57.709
Because there's lots of stuff going on,

1328
00:49:57.709 --> 00:50:00.626
in the Empire and in Xhorhas, and--

1329
00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.637
TALIESIN: Resistance, wisdom.

1330
00:50:03.637 --> 00:50:05.016
MATT: Okay.

1331
00:50:05.016 --> 00:50:06.555
As you're having this conversation,

1332
00:50:06.555 --> 00:50:08.969
are you guys walking along the edge of the water,

1333
00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:12.067
or along the bank, where the snow is?

1334
00:50:12.067 --> 00:50:13.966
LIAM: On ice or on land?
MATT: On ice or on land.

1335
00:50:13.966 --> 00:50:15.224
MARISHA and LAURA: On land.

1336
00:50:15.224 --> 00:50:16.057
MATT: Okay.

1337
00:50:16.057 --> 00:50:17.923
LIAM: (thudding)
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

1338
00:50:17.923 --> 00:50:20.451
As you're walking through, looking around,

1339
00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:22.653
you can see the mists and occasionally shapes shift through,

1340
00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:25.829
you're not sure if it's just the wind as it gusts,

1341
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:27.575
and you clutch yourself and your hair

1342
00:50:27.575 --> 00:50:29.674
blows past your face, and you glance around and can see

1343
00:50:29.674 --> 00:50:32.255
things moving around the periphery.

1344
00:50:32.255 --> 00:50:34.544
Keeping a distance at times, some closer than others.

1345
00:50:34.544 --> 00:50:37.042
You glance past the ice and you think you can see

1346
00:50:37.042 --> 00:50:40.879
a handful of faces from underneath looking up.

1347
00:50:40.879 --> 00:50:43.029
You blink and they're gone.

1348
00:50:44.965 --> 00:50:46.220
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1349
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.512
TRAVIS: That was a bad idea on my part.

1350
00:50:47.512 --> 00:50:49.944
LAURA: Maybe, like, the ones above the ice are good

1351
00:50:49.944 --> 00:50:53.242
and the ones below the ice try to suck you in or something,

1352
00:50:53.242 --> 00:50:54.524
and they were trying to keep the bad ones

1353
00:50:54.524 --> 00:50:56.383
from coming back out.

1354
00:50:56.383 --> 00:50:57.983
SAM: Maybe they're all bad.

1355
00:50:57.983 --> 00:50:59.035
TALIESIN: Maybe they're just trapped here.

1356
00:50:59.035 --> 00:51:01.461
I don't know, they haven't done anything to us yet.

1357
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:02.813
TRAVIS: Just looking for company.

1358
00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:04.329
LAURA: I'm going to pull out Tusk Love

1359
00:51:04.329 --> 00:51:06.159
and just start reading it to them.

1360
00:51:06.159 --> 00:51:07.933
MATT: Just loudly?

1361
00:51:07.933 --> 00:51:09.979
(laughter)

1362
00:51:09.979 --> 00:51:12.029
SAM: Porn will keep us safe.

1363
00:51:12.029 --> 00:51:14.570
TALIESIN: So true.
MATT: Okay.

1364
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:19.545
Carrying on, for the next 20, 30 minutes or so,

1365
00:51:20.416 --> 00:51:23.374
as Jester loudly reads

1366
00:51:23.374 --> 00:51:26.507
outward into the open cold air

1367
00:51:26.507 --> 00:51:29.507
of the valley at the base of Kravaraad.

1368
00:51:29.507 --> 00:51:33.895
LAURA: Kravaraad needs a little steaminess to heat it up.

1369
00:51:33.895 --> 00:51:36.563
MATT: You do watch as more figures

1370
00:51:36.563 --> 00:51:39.516
begin to appear at the peripheral.

1371
00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:42.725
There's that same woman who is almost to the front,

1372
00:51:42.725 --> 00:51:46.337
and you see three other figures.

1373
00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:49.671
Then there are six, and there are 12,

1374
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:52.221
and they're all just drifting in a semi-circle

1375
00:51:52.221 --> 00:51:53.363
behind you, following.

1376
00:51:53.363 --> 00:51:54.229
TALIESIN: Do I recognize this?

1377
00:51:54.229 --> 00:51:55.987
SAM: The love the book!
MARISHA: They love the porn!

1378
00:51:55.987 --> 00:51:58.226
LAURA: I think they do!
SAM: It's a page-turner!

1379
00:51:58.226 --> 00:51:59.617
MARISHA: You're drawing an audience.

1380
00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:01.334
LIAM: Pied Piper of Smut.

1381
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:05.909
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop walking forward for a second

1382
00:52:05.909 --> 00:52:07.036
and turn around.

1383
00:52:07.036 --> 00:52:08.335
MATT: Okay. As everyone keeps walking,

1384
00:52:08.335 --> 00:52:10.160
they keep pace with everybody

1385
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.397
and begin to approach you.

1386
00:52:12.397 --> 00:52:13.688
TALIESIN: Dust?

1387
00:52:15.347 --> 00:52:17.040
MATT: No recognition.

1388
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.669
TALIESIN: Clay.

1389
00:52:18.669 --> 00:52:20.086
MATT: No recognition.

1390
00:52:21.215 --> 00:52:23.673
The woman--
TALIESIN: Do you need help?

1391
00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:28.354
MATT: Passes through you, you feel a freezing cold

1392
00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:30.937
icicle flash through your body.

1393
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.781
For one instant, your breath (exhales)

1394
00:52:34.781 --> 00:52:39.056
is drawn from your lungs, and then the need for warmth

1395
00:52:39.056 --> 00:52:41.625
becomes very, very apparent.

1396
00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.197
TALIESIN: I don't feel so good.

1397
00:52:43.197 --> 00:52:45.722
LAURA: Oh, oh.

1398
00:52:45.722 --> 00:52:47.438
MATT: Caduceus is behind all you guys.

1399
00:52:47.438 --> 00:52:50.242
TALIESIN: Well, I didn't-- I mean-- I just went to
the back of the line.

1400
00:52:50.242 --> 00:52:51.655
TRAVIS: Take this rod.

1401
00:52:51.655 --> 00:52:53.252
It's actually really nice.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1402
00:52:53.252 --> 00:52:54.375
Is the rod helping?

1403
00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:55.208
MATT: Yeah.

1404
00:52:56.546 --> 00:52:58.957
TALIESIN: Okay, heat will-- okay.

1405
00:52:58.957 --> 00:53:00.238
They're not happy.

1406
00:53:00.238 --> 00:53:02.716
LAURA: Maybe I should not read this book anymore.

1407
00:53:02.716 --> 00:53:04.682
TALIESIN: No, it seems-- I don't know.

1408
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:05.890
TRAVIS: Distractions are good.

1409
00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:07.481
Let's keep going, keep reading.

1410
00:53:07.481 --> 00:53:09.662
LAURA: Yeah, you want me to keep going.

1411
00:53:09.662 --> 00:53:11.772
TALIESIN: Just for fun, one more Detect Undead,

1412
00:53:11.772 --> 00:53:14.106
just to see if there's anything beyond what we can see.

1413
00:53:14.106 --> 00:53:15.289
MATT: Okay.

1414
00:53:15.289 --> 00:53:17.904
SAM: Read the part where he plunged inside of her again.

1415
00:53:17.904 --> 00:53:19.216
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: Whoa.

1416
00:53:19.216 --> 00:53:20.443
SAM: That was a good part.

1417
00:53:20.443 --> 00:53:22.558
LAURA: (laughing)

1418
00:53:22.558 --> 00:53:27.479
MATT: You tune out the sequence that Jester

1419
00:53:27.479 --> 00:53:30.979
is loudly professing amongst the audience.

1420
00:53:32.331 --> 00:53:33.920
LIAM: Areolas.

1421
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.927
MATT: As you close your eyes, you sense dozens

1422
00:53:37.927 --> 00:53:42.927
and dozens of entities around all of you.

1423
00:53:43.775 --> 00:53:46.353
TALIESIN: Are they concentrated anywhere?

1424
00:53:46.353 --> 00:53:48.092
Or is it more towards the back, towards where--

1425
00:53:48.092 --> 00:53:49.710
MATT: More towards the back, they're trailing.

1426
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:52.385
TALIESIN: They're following.
MATT: They're following.

1427
00:53:52.385 --> 00:53:55.251
MARISHA: Maybe it has something to do with you.

1428
00:53:55.251 --> 00:53:56.634
TALIESIN: Maybe.

1429
00:53:57.574 --> 00:53:59.386
SAM: Are they just following him?

1430
00:53:59.386 --> 00:54:00.912
MARISHA: Yeah, are they just following Caduceus?

1431
00:54:00.912 --> 00:54:02.066
MATT: They're following the group.

1432
00:54:02.066 --> 00:54:04.190
MARISHA: But Caduceus is with the group.

1433
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:05.957
MATT: Right, they're following the group.

1434
00:54:05.957 --> 00:54:07.270
LIAM: Jester, do you want to pause your reading

1435
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:09.357
for a minute or two and see if that has any difference?

1436
00:54:09.357 --> 00:54:12.341
SAM: Sure, just finish this one sentence though.

1437
00:54:12.341 --> 00:54:13.574
LAURA: And--

1438
00:54:13.574 --> 00:54:15.583
it was real deep.

1439
00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:17.099
(laughter)

1440
00:54:17.099 --> 00:54:18.464
MATT: We didn't say it was a good book.

1441
00:54:18.464 --> 00:54:19.707
(laughter)

1442
00:54:19.707 --> 00:54:21.965
TALIESIN: Yet we keep reading it.
SAM: That's just quality writing.

1443
00:54:21.965 --> 00:54:23.336
TRAVIS: "And it was real deep."

1444
00:54:23.336 --> 00:54:24.852
MATT: Fanfiction.net,

1445
00:54:24.852 --> 00:54:29.049
number three best story in 2004.

1446
00:54:29.049 --> 00:54:31.096
TRAVIS: That's where you got it?

1447
00:54:31.096 --> 00:54:33.596
LAURA: I was looking at my spells, it's just that, okay.

1448
00:54:33.596 --> 00:54:35.698
MATT: Reskinned Gargoyles fanfiction.

1449
00:54:35.698 --> 00:54:39.106
(laughter)

1450
00:54:41.072 --> 00:54:44.538
MATT: So. You finish the phrase and pause for a moment,

1451
00:54:44.538 --> 00:54:48.443
and continue to walk in silence for another few minutes.

1452
00:54:48.443 --> 00:54:51.969
As you do, you watch the spectral figures begin to

1453
00:54:51.969 --> 00:54:54.021
pull back into the mist and disappear.

1454
00:54:54.021 --> 00:54:58.059
LAURA: Oh, they did just want to hear about it.

1455
00:54:58.059 --> 00:55:00.035
LIAM: Maybe they just missed sounds of the living.

1456
00:55:00.035 --> 00:55:02.233
SAM: The stopped following us when she stopped reading?

1457
00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:04.667
MATT: A number of them are still there,
but the numbers have dwindled.

1458
00:55:04.667 --> 00:55:06.530
Where once there was maybe--
SAM: Oh, they really like the book.

1459
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:08.158
MATT: -- a couple dozen figures in the mist

1460
00:55:08.158 --> 00:55:10.511
that were drifting behind you, now there's about eight.

1461
00:55:10.511 --> 00:55:11.837
SAM: Maybe you should start again.

1462
00:55:11.837 --> 00:55:15.395
TRAVIS: Maybe they're looking for someone--

1463
00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:18.320
maybe they're looking for someone to come for them.

1464
00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.184
LIAM: Maybe they're just not used to
the living being around.

1465
00:55:22.184 --> 00:55:24.401
TALIESIN: People would have to come here at least,

1466
00:55:24.401 --> 00:55:26.540
I don't know.

1467
00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:27.881
TRAVIS: Crematory, you said.

1468
00:55:27.881 --> 00:55:29.281
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1469
00:55:33.472 --> 00:55:34.305
LIAM: Shall we push on?

1470
00:55:34.305 --> 00:55:36.388
SAM: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1471
00:55:38.444 --> 00:55:40.413
MATT: Do you continue reading, or do you remain stopped?

1472
00:55:40.413 --> 00:55:41.615
LAURA: What do you want me to do, guys?

1473
00:55:41.615 --> 00:55:45.014
SAM: I mean, the ghosts did seem a little horny, so maybe--

1474
00:55:45.014 --> 00:55:47.405
TALIESIN: I'd say, all things considered,

1475
00:55:47.405 --> 00:55:50.940
I'd rather have happy ghosts than unhappy ghosts,

1476
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.312
and they seemed to-- perhaps not loudly,

1477
00:55:53.312 --> 00:55:55.428
but continue for the--

1478
00:55:55.428 --> 00:55:58.732
I've been finding it oddly comforting.

1479
00:55:58.732 --> 00:56:01.695
TRAVIS: Maybe just pause it for now and not broadcast

1480
00:56:01.695 --> 00:56:03.864
our location as we're walking.

1481
00:56:03.864 --> 00:56:05.558
LIAM: Did they seem neutral or positive?

1482
00:56:05.558 --> 00:56:06.623
Neutral, yeah?

1483
00:56:06.623 --> 00:56:07.836
SAM: Did they look horny?

1484
00:56:07.836 --> 00:56:10.227
MATT: They seemed naturally ghastly.

1485
00:56:10.227 --> 00:56:15.227
Expressions unchanged, slack jawed, eyeless sunken sockets.

1486
00:56:15.657 --> 00:56:17.385
You haven't gotten very close,

1487
00:56:17.385 --> 00:56:19.663
but from like the 30-foot distance that you have a view

1488
00:56:19.663 --> 00:56:22.546
of most of these entities, they just drift--

1489
00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:24.629
LAURA: Yes, but what about their crotchal regions,

1490
00:56:24.629 --> 00:56:25.462
were there tents?

1491
00:56:25.462 --> 00:56:27.325
MATT: Roll a perception check.

1492
00:56:27.325 --> 00:56:29.561
LIAM: Poor man, trying to build atmosphere.

1493
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:31.720
LAURA: I rolled pretty good.

1494
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.700
11.

1495
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.533
MATT: 11?

1496
00:56:33.533 --> 00:56:34.947
(laughter)

1497
00:56:34.947 --> 00:56:36.073
SAM: They have no genitals.

1498
00:56:36.073 --> 00:56:38.565
MATT: Unfortunately, their spectral forms

1499
00:56:38.565 --> 00:56:41.599
do lack definitive genitals, but your imagination

1500
00:56:41.599 --> 00:56:44.538
helps you imagine that sure, maybe half of them

1501
00:56:44.538 --> 00:56:45.814
are pitching a tent.

1502
00:56:45.814 --> 00:56:47.019
SAM: Wow!

1503
00:56:47.019 --> 00:56:48.485
LIAM: Ghost dick.

1504
00:56:49.946 --> 00:56:52.241
MATT: That's the sequel, actually, to Tusk Love.

1505
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:55.450
TALIESIN: I got a good look-- oh, goddamn it.

1506
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:56.515
I love this so much.

1507
00:56:56.515 --> 00:56:57.503
MATT: Caduceus, what were you doing?

1508
00:56:57.503 --> 00:56:59.119
TALIESIN: I said I got a good look at one,

1509
00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:00.347
none of them have eyes?

1510
00:57:00.347 --> 00:57:01.924
MATT: None of them have eyes.

1511
00:57:01.924 --> 00:57:04.246
TALIESIN: Do the faces in the lake have eyes?

1512
00:57:04.246 --> 00:57:05.095
MATT: No.

1513
00:57:05.095 --> 00:57:06.461
TALIESIN: It's just no eyes.

1514
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:08.890
MATT: The more time you spend with them,

1515
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:10.160
you can see some appear to be humanoid,

1516
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.970
many elven, some dwarven, some orcish.

1517
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:17.542
It's a spread of various backgrounds and lineages.

1518
00:57:17.542 --> 00:57:19.888
TALIESIN: I'm going to say let's continue to show them

1519
00:57:19.888 --> 00:57:21.392
whatever respect we can.

1520
00:57:21.392 --> 00:57:23.083
This is a little--

1521
00:57:24.292 --> 00:57:26.008
I refuse to believe

1522
00:57:26.008 --> 00:57:29.784
that this is here to harm us.

1523
00:57:29.784 --> 00:57:33.272
SAM: By respect, do you mean reading smut or not?

1524
00:57:33.272 --> 00:57:34.558
TALIESIN: I think reading smut.

1525
00:57:34.558 --> 00:57:36.227
SAM: Okay.

1526
00:57:36.227 --> 00:57:37.678
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Okay.

1527
00:57:37.678 --> 00:57:40.224
TALIESIN: Let's keep going.
LAURA: I'll read it quieter.

1528
00:57:40.224 --> 00:57:41.686
SAM: Yeah.

1529
00:57:41.686 --> 00:57:43.762
TALIESIN: Skip to the good parts, I think.

1530
00:57:43.762 --> 00:57:44.968
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1531
00:57:44.968 --> 00:57:46.224
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not a good part.

1532
00:57:46.224 --> 00:57:47.138
LAURA: Oh, but it's okay.

1533
00:57:47.138 --> 00:57:49.282
TALIESIN: That's very graphic.
SAM: It's building tension.

1534
00:57:49.282 --> 00:57:50.393
TRAVIS: Let's keep going.

1535
00:57:50.393 --> 00:57:51.864
LAURA: Okay.

1536
00:57:51.864 --> 00:57:54.332
As he ripped open her bodice--

1537
00:57:54.332 --> 00:57:56.597
(laughter)

1538
00:57:56.597 --> 00:57:57.923
TALIESIN: It's like five gold--

1539
00:57:57.923 --> 00:58:01.558
MATT: The storm begins to build.

1540
00:58:01.558 --> 00:58:04.555
The snow and sleet begins to pelt you in painful ways,

1541
00:58:04.555 --> 00:58:06.404
when you're not guarding your face

1542
00:58:06.404 --> 00:58:09.710
from the somewhat diagonal impact.

1543
00:58:10.943 --> 00:58:14.029
You find yourself coming around the other side,

1544
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:16.912
and get a decent look now

1545
00:58:16.912 --> 00:58:20.017
of maybe 100 or so feet away,

1546
00:58:20.017 --> 00:58:22.867
of where the most--

1547
00:58:24.392 --> 00:58:28.465
where the closest element of trickling lava vent

1548
00:58:28.465 --> 00:58:32.940
is entering the icy lake itself.

1549
00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.014
You can see the steam column, just a perpetual--

1550
00:58:36.014 --> 00:58:39.617
just white-ish steam that mingles with the nearby mist

1551
00:58:39.617 --> 00:58:42.668
and then carries upward, and the pillar seems to merge

1552
00:58:42.668 --> 00:58:44.946
with the clouds as the wind blows it

1553
00:58:44.946 --> 00:58:47.121
in the direction of the strong winds.

1554
00:58:47.121 --> 00:58:48.997
TALIESIN: How's the warmth of the water here?

1555
00:58:48.997 --> 00:58:50.613
MATT: It is still frozen around you.

1556
00:58:50.613 --> 00:58:51.917
TALIESIN: Oh, we haven't gotten close to it.

1557
00:58:51.917 --> 00:58:54.456
MATT: You haven't gotten that close yet.

1558
00:58:54.456 --> 00:58:57.303
The mist around you directly, the spirits

1559
00:58:57.303 --> 00:58:58.682
are still following.

1560
00:58:58.682 --> 00:59:03.116
As you're reading, the numbers begin to swell once more,

1561
00:59:03.116 --> 00:59:07.425
to about 30 or so entities

1562
00:59:07.425 --> 00:59:09.765
keeping on the outskirts

1563
00:59:09.765 --> 00:59:12.491
of your travel group.

1564
00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:15.299
Eventually, you come to the point where you can see

1565
00:59:15.299 --> 00:59:17.711
the ice is melting and thinning,

1566
00:59:17.711 --> 00:59:20.711
and you can see actual water,

1567
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:23.252
liquid water, is visible.

1568
00:59:23.252 --> 00:59:26.050
Also, the temperature is rising towards the base

1569
00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:28.808
of where this portion of the mountain is.

1570
00:59:28.808 --> 00:59:30.516
You can see there are chunks of snow

1571
00:59:30.516 --> 00:59:33.318
that do manage to find their way along the mountain,

1572
00:59:33.318 --> 00:59:37.425
but a large portion of it doesn't seem to allow it

1573
00:59:37.425 --> 00:59:40.410
to stay very long.

1574
00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.622
As you approach where the lava is,

1575
00:59:42.622 --> 00:59:46.840
you can see the spectral figures begin to peel off,

1576
00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.546
until eventually they all stop

1577
00:59:48.546 --> 00:59:51.485
and begin to fall further into the distance.

1578
00:59:51.485 --> 00:59:53.440
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn around one more time

1579
00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:57.940
to the edge of where they were and just give a moment,

1580
00:59:58.926 --> 01:00:02.175
just kneel in recognition.

1581
01:00:02.175 --> 01:00:06.161
MATT: One by one, they all vanish entirely into the mist.

1582
01:00:06.161 --> 01:00:08.144
That single female figure that you first encountered,

1583
01:00:08.144 --> 01:00:11.044
the last one standing before--

1584
01:00:12.152 --> 01:00:14.028
disappearing.

1585
01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:17.458
MARISHA: She stayed for the whole reading.

1586
01:00:17.458 --> 01:00:18.291
TRAVIS: (sighs)

1587
01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:19.720
MARISHA: Biggest fan.
SAM: Yep.

1588
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.267
TALIESIN: She might've written it.

1589
01:00:21.267 --> 01:00:23.195
LAURA: (gasps)

1590
01:00:23.195 --> 01:00:25.686
TALIESIN: I don't remember, who's the author?

1591
01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:27.943
LAURA: Matilda Merceria.

1592
01:00:27.943 --> 01:00:29.164
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

1593
01:00:29.164 --> 01:00:33.001
LIAM: Who doesn't like a book club?

1594
01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:35.235
LAURA: Maybe we should just come back here once a week

1595
01:00:35.235 --> 01:00:36.693
and read to them.

1596
01:00:36.693 --> 01:00:39.118
SAM: Is there a cave that we're looking at,

1597
01:00:39.118 --> 01:00:41.604
or is it just mountain?

1598
01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:42.941
TRAVIS: Lava flow right now.

1599
01:00:42.941 --> 01:00:45.097
TALIESIN: There'll be a cave.

1600
01:00:45.097 --> 01:00:47.506
If I recall.

1601
01:00:47.506 --> 01:00:51.232
MATT: Well, from what you recall, it's probably a cave.

1602
01:00:51.232 --> 01:00:53.890
LIAM: Now do we climb?

1603
01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:55.311
SAM: Like, is there a mouth of the cave

1604
01:00:55.311 --> 01:00:56.802
that we can walk into, or no?

1605
01:00:56.802 --> 01:00:59.722
MATT: Make a perception check.

1606
01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:00.555
SAM: 10.

1607
01:01:00.555 --> 01:01:01.388
MATT: 10.

1608
01:01:01.388 --> 01:01:03.104
From what you can see now at the base

1609
01:01:03.104 --> 01:01:06.455
of this large, black, rising mountain--

1610
01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:09.623
The smell, by the way, is a mixture of various

1611
01:01:09.623 --> 01:01:14.623
sulfurous gases with the clean-chilled air of the storm

1612
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.422
mingling, so in waves it gets stronger and lessens.

1613
01:01:19.422 --> 01:01:22.476
Sometimes it stings your eyes a bit as the smoke

1614
01:01:22.476 --> 01:01:25.143
and the steam gets blown in your direction.

1615
01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:27.846
From where you stand, it's just mountain.

1616
01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:31.833
You don't see any caverns or openings or pockets.

1617
01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:34.083
To continue, you have to choose

1618
01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:35.936
which side of the mountain to go around.

1619
01:01:35.936 --> 01:01:37.687
You can go around the left side,

1620
01:01:37.687 --> 01:01:39.930
keeping the left theme, or the right side,

1621
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.462
but to travel the right side, you would have to find

1622
01:01:41.462 --> 01:01:44.508
some way to circumvent the 10-foot wide

1623
01:01:44.508 --> 01:01:46.528
little river of lava.

1624
01:01:46.528 --> 01:01:48.268
TRAVIS: Usually, historically good for us.

1625
01:01:48.268 --> 01:01:49.632
LIAM: By the way, I've been to Yellowstone.

1626
01:01:49.632 --> 01:01:51.310
Sulfurous means it smells like farts here.

1627
01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:53.114
TALIESIN: It does.
MATT: Yeah.

1628
01:01:53.114 --> 01:01:55.088
Rotorua, New Zealand, I still have clothes

1629
01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:56.192
that smell like it.

1630
01:01:56.192 --> 01:01:57.863
LIAM: It's amazing, it's really bad.

1631
01:01:57.863 --> 01:02:00.496
TALIESIN: Dust was told to walk the mountains

1632
01:02:00.496 --> 01:02:03.695
till they found a cave

1633
01:02:03.695 --> 01:02:07.422
with an onyx pool of magma.

1634
01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:11.255
MARISHA: Oh, magma is like a thing we're looking for?

1635
01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:13.949
TRAVIS: An onyx pool of magma.

1636
01:02:13.949 --> 01:02:15.174
TALIESIN: Onyx pool, a cave,

1637
01:02:15.174 --> 01:02:17.540
with an onyx pool of magma within.

1638
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.614
At least, that's the story.

1639
01:02:19.614 --> 01:02:20.713
SAM: Left or right?

1640
01:02:20.713 --> 01:02:22.066
TRAVIS: Well, it could be up.

1641
01:02:22.066 --> 01:02:23.140
TALIESIN: Up?
SAM: Yeah.

1642
01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.695
LIAM: On this side or that is the question.

1643
01:02:25.695 --> 01:02:28.189
MARISHA: Let's avoid crossing the lava until we have to.

1644
01:02:28.189 --> 01:02:29.914
TALIESIN: Let's follow it up.

1645
01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:31.347
SAM: Sure, we'll stick left and go up.

1646
01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.413
TALIESIN: Stay warm.

1647
01:02:33.413 --> 01:02:35.063
TRAVIS: There can't be lava flowing underwater,

1648
01:02:35.063 --> 01:02:36.973
I'm just saying. Okay, let's go.

1649
01:02:36.973 --> 01:02:38.769
MATT: So just going up?

1650
01:02:38.769 --> 01:02:40.945
LIAM: Yeah, how precarious is it?

1651
01:02:40.945 --> 01:02:43.853
MATT: It's not super precarious, yet.

1652
01:02:43.853 --> 01:02:46.106
You're towards the base, and so the angle is not

1653
01:02:46.106 --> 01:02:47.738
extremely steep at the moment.

1654
01:02:47.738 --> 01:02:49.328
TRAVIS: More of that porous rock-like soil.

1655
01:02:49.328 --> 01:02:52.238
MATT: Yeah, and the good news is, because of that, also,

1656
01:02:52.238 --> 01:02:55.029
at least this close to where the flow is,

1657
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:58.519
it's a good enough grip, so there aren't any slick areas.

1658
01:02:58.519 --> 01:03:00.719
You're used to the ice and the snow

1659
01:03:00.719 --> 01:03:01.873
you've been traversing at this point.

1660
01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:03.357
This side of the mountain was a little easier

1661
01:03:03.357 --> 01:03:05.606
to keep your boots on.

1662
01:03:05.606 --> 01:03:10.020
Trekking up the side, hiking up the edge,

1663
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.439
the light is just beginning to dwindle.

1664
01:03:14.439 --> 01:03:15.336
LAURA: Oh no.

1665
01:03:15.336 --> 01:03:17.572
MATT: You're probably about 40 minutes or so out

1666
01:03:17.572 --> 01:03:19.158
before dusk finds you.

1667
01:03:19.158 --> 01:03:21.604
LAURA: We don't want to be climbing when it gets dark.

1668
01:03:21.604 --> 01:03:23.664
TALIESIN: Well, we can start at least looking

1669
01:03:23.664 --> 01:03:26.449
for a place to set up camp.

1670
01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:28.402
We have the dome on the side.

1671
01:03:28.402 --> 01:03:30.319
SAM: Sure.
TALIESIN: If we have to.

1672
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.155
MARISHA: It's going to suck.
TALIESIN: If we <i>have</i> to.

1673
01:03:33.155 --> 01:03:35.174
MARISHA: Yeah.

1674
01:03:35.174 --> 01:03:37.806
TALIESIN: Can we see where the magma is,

1675
01:03:37.806 --> 01:03:39.178
where the burst is?

1676
01:03:39.178 --> 01:03:40.263
Like where the vein is?

1677
01:03:40.263 --> 01:03:43.079
MATT: It's about, I'd say,

1678
01:03:43.079 --> 01:03:45.254
400 or so feet up from where you are.

1679
01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.623
TALIESIN: Are we above the treeline already, or no?

1680
01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:48.922
Oh, there's no treeline.

1681
01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:51.931
MATT: There's no treeline here.

1682
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:54.502
TALIESIN: There's no shadows being cast by rocks

1683
01:03:54.502 --> 01:03:56.901
that might be concealing a cave or anything.

1684
01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:58.005
MATT: Make a perception check.

1685
01:03:58.005 --> 01:04:02.209
LAURA: Or any kind of like, looks like a flat area.

1686
01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:03.085
SAM: A mesa?

1687
01:04:03.085 --> 01:04:04.257
TALIESIN: 22.

1688
01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:05.336
MATT: 22.

1689
01:04:05.336 --> 01:04:08.016
Looking up this side and above you right now,

1690
01:04:08.016 --> 01:04:11.854
there are a few shadowed crevasses,

1691
01:04:11.854 --> 01:04:13.321
but nothing that seems cave-like,

1692
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:15.265
from your current visual perspective.

1693
01:04:15.265 --> 01:04:17.951
TALIESIN: What would I do if I were, (gasps).

1694
01:04:18.785 --> 01:04:21.388
Do we have a bird right now?

1695
01:04:21.388 --> 01:04:22.221
TRAVIS: A what?

1696
01:04:22.221 --> 01:04:23.054
SAM: A bird.

1697
01:04:23.054 --> 01:04:23.887
TALIESIN: No.

1698
01:04:25.176 --> 01:04:26.752
Tricky.
LIAM: Always a cat.

1699
01:04:26.752 --> 01:04:28.315
TALIESIN: Currently a cat.

1700
01:04:28.315 --> 01:04:31.261
SAM: Jester, can't you turn into a bird?

1701
01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:33.057
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1702
01:04:33.057 --> 01:04:35.156
TALIESIN: I'll feel a little more worried about you

1703
01:04:35.156 --> 01:04:39.194
heading off on your own up into a storm as a living--

1704
01:04:39.194 --> 01:04:41.617
SAM: She could take someone else.

1705
01:04:41.617 --> 01:04:43.484
LAURA: That way I can kill both of us.

1706
01:04:43.484 --> 01:04:44.769
SAM: I could ride on your back.

1707
01:04:44.769 --> 01:04:45.708
LIAM: We could go together.

1708
01:04:45.708 --> 01:04:48.528
MARISHA: How far away is the storm?

1709
01:04:48.528 --> 01:04:50.583
MATT: It's probably going to coincide with dusk,

1710
01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:51.716
if not a little bit afterward.

1711
01:04:51.716 --> 01:04:53.547
Like the heavy elements of it,

1712
01:04:53.547 --> 01:04:57.071
it is getting heavier, the storm is here,

1713
01:04:57.071 --> 01:05:00.389
but it's not reaching a severe intensity yet.

1714
01:05:00.389 --> 01:05:01.380
MARISHA: Are there signs of

1715
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.194
lightning and thunder in the distance?

1716
01:05:03.194 --> 01:05:05.818
Or is it more of a snow winter storm situation?

1717
01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:09.065
MATT: At the moment it looks more like a snowy flurry.

1718
01:05:09.065 --> 01:05:12.220
TALIESIN: Camping closer to the magma

1719
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.048
will mean that we'll stay warmer

1720
01:05:14.048 --> 01:05:16.292
and that the snow will probably melt before it hits us.

1721
01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:19.073
It also means that the magma might divert,

1722
01:05:19.073 --> 01:05:20.600
and then that could get tricky.

1723
01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.667
LAURA: That won't happen, probably.

1724
01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.136
LIAM: Well, it's tricky, but if we can find a flat point

1725
01:05:24.136 --> 01:05:26.312
on the hillside, I am able to regulate

1726
01:05:26.312 --> 01:05:30.489
the temperature inside the hut here.

1727
01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:31.829
But we have to find that.

1728
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:34.331
TALIESIN: Let's keep an eye peeled for--

1729
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:37.261
LAURA: Sounds like a job for an eagle.

1730
01:05:37.261 --> 01:05:38.772
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to keep eyes.

1731
01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:40.402
LAURA: I'm going to Polymorph.

1732
01:05:40.402 --> 01:05:41.727
MATT: Go for it. Okay.

1733
01:05:41.727 --> 01:05:43.225
SAM: Got you a list somewhere in here.

1734
01:05:43.225 --> 01:05:44.253
Just got to find it.

1735
01:05:44.253 --> 01:05:47.702
LAURA: I want a smart thing, a big eagle.

1736
01:05:47.702 --> 01:05:49.560
LIAM: Giant eagle.
LAURA: Yeah.

1737
01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.040
What we were before.

1738
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.574
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Giant hawk.

1739
01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.249
SAM: Oh, here it is.

1740
01:05:55.249 --> 01:05:57.022
These are all the flying things.

1741
01:05:57.022 --> 01:05:58.747
LAURA: Yeah, but it doesn't understand--

1742
01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:00.611
LIAM: Giant eagle isn't, they're very intelligent.

1743
01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:02.168
LAURA: Isn't or is?
LIAM: Is.

1744
01:06:02.168 --> 01:06:03.730
LAURA: Okay, a giant eagle.

1745
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:04.606
MATT: All right.

1746
01:06:04.606 --> 01:06:06.883
LIAM: Same, I don't want you to go alone.

1747
01:06:06.883 --> 01:06:08.171
LAURA: Thanks, Caleb.

1748
01:06:08.171 --> 01:06:10.751
MATT: You now have two giant eagles with massive,

1749
01:06:10.751 --> 01:06:14.848
I'd say 20-plus foot wingspan, tip to tip.

1750
01:06:14.848 --> 01:06:16.208
LIAM: Mine is albino.

1751
01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:17.059
SAM: Tip to tip.

1752
01:06:17.059 --> 01:06:19.363
MATT: An albino one, to even be more hidden amongst the--

1753
01:06:19.363 --> 01:06:20.446
LAURA: Mine's blue.

1754
01:06:20.446 --> 01:06:22.517
MATT: -- the dark mountain.

1755
01:06:22.517 --> 01:06:23.958
All righty.

1756
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:25.902
White and blue, perfect.

1757
01:06:25.902 --> 01:06:27.191
LIAM: Just need a red one.

1758
01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:28.608
(laughter)

1759
01:06:28.608 --> 01:06:32.376
SAM: I'll jump on Jester and I'll use my glamored armor

1760
01:06:32.376 --> 01:06:33.889
to change my armor to red.

1761
01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.024
MATT: There you go. Perfect.

1762
01:06:36.024 --> 01:06:38.124
LIAM: So go over to D&amp;D Beyond.

1763
01:06:38.124 --> 01:06:41.928
TRAVIS: ♪ Team America, fuck yeah ♪

1764
01:06:41.928 --> 01:06:43.720
MATT: They got a week left, they got to try

1765
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.327
every edge they can get.

1766
01:06:45.327 --> 01:06:47.581
All right, you both take up.

1767
01:06:47.581 --> 01:06:49.892
The winds are strong, but so are the eagles.

1768
01:06:49.892 --> 01:06:51.243
You're riding the eagle, all right.

1769
01:06:51.243 --> 01:06:53.331
On the back of Jester's eagle form.

1770
01:06:53.331 --> 01:06:55.226
Which direction are you guys taking?

1771
01:06:55.226 --> 01:06:56.317
LAURA: Up.

1772
01:06:58.277 --> 01:06:59.818
LIAM: Straight up and peer down, yeah?

1773
01:06:59.818 --> 01:07:00.707
MATT: All right, so both of you guys are going

1774
01:07:00.707 --> 01:07:01.932
straight up and peering down.

1775
01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:04.270
LAURA: Yeah, we just want to like look for a flat surface

1776
01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.369
so there's something to camp on close by.

1777
01:07:06.369 --> 01:07:07.524
Or a cave opening or anything.

1778
01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:08.745
SAM: On the way to the up.

1779
01:07:08.745 --> 01:07:13.128
LIAM: Options for a 10-foot radius feasible--

1780
01:07:13.128 --> 01:07:14.233
LAURA: Camping ground.

1781
01:07:14.233 --> 01:07:15.066
MATT: Okay.

1782
01:07:15.066 --> 01:07:18.406
The wind gets stronger the higher up you go.

1783
01:07:18.406 --> 01:07:19.978
LAURA: So not up too high.

1784
01:07:19.978 --> 01:07:21.123
MATT: All right.

1785
01:07:21.123 --> 01:07:21.956
Okay.

1786
01:07:21.956 --> 01:07:23.972
LAURA: We're going to keep closer to the mountain

1787
01:07:23.972 --> 01:07:25.480
to keep the winds.

1788
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:26.563
MATT: Okay.

1789
01:07:26.563 --> 01:07:30.428
Perception check from all three of you.

1790
01:07:30.428 --> 01:07:31.354
SAM: 14.

1791
01:07:31.354 --> 01:07:32.456
LAURA: As eagles?

1792
01:07:32.456 --> 01:07:34.424
MATT: Now, you both have advantage--

1793
01:07:34.424 --> 01:07:36.491
LIAM: Natural 20.
MATT: -- as eagles.

1794
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.080
SAM: In the meantime, why don't you start looking at the--

1795
01:07:43.431 --> 01:07:46.754
LAURA: I don't know how to do that.

1796
01:07:46.754 --> 01:07:47.849
What's the add?

1797
01:07:47.849 --> 01:07:48.887
Well, he got 20, it doesn't matter.

1798
01:07:48.887 --> 01:07:49.728
SAM: Yeah, it's fine.

1799
01:07:49.728 --> 01:07:53.738
LAURA: I got seven plus whatever it is.

1800
01:07:53.738 --> 01:07:54.818
SAM: Oh, 14.

1801
01:07:54.818 --> 01:07:56.859
MATT: 14? What's the total, Caleb?

1802
01:07:56.859 --> 01:08:00.968
LIAM: Oh, 20 plus, well, I didn't have giant eagle open,

1803
01:08:00.968 --> 01:08:03.268
I stopped--
MATT: Plus four to its perception.

1804
01:08:03.268 --> 01:08:04.591
LIAM: You're so good.

1805
01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:06.187
MATT: So 24.

1806
01:08:06.187 --> 01:08:07.228
All right.

1807
01:08:07.228 --> 01:08:10.407
As you guys peer up, you look, there are a couple of shelves

1808
01:08:10.407 --> 01:08:13.782
that could work for an evening's rest point,

1809
01:08:13.782 --> 01:08:15.923
but they're a little bit of a hike away,

1810
01:08:15.923 --> 01:08:18.088
and a little steeper up the side.

1811
01:08:18.088 --> 01:08:23.074
You, from that perspective point, see across the lava flow

1812
01:08:23.074 --> 01:08:25.954
and down on the southern side,

1813
01:08:25.954 --> 01:08:28.981
there is a plume of smoke that is rising up

1814
01:08:28.981 --> 01:08:32.139
from a little bit of an outcropping,

1815
01:08:32.139 --> 01:08:34.863
but there's no lava vent or flow emerging from it.

1816
01:08:34.863 --> 01:08:37.679
LIAM: Okay, so cross the lava, how far up the mountain

1817
01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:38.736
did you say?

1818
01:08:38.736 --> 01:08:41.383
MATT: It's maybe about 200 feet up, comparison to where

1819
01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.829
you guys currently are, on more of the southern,

1820
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:44.772
southeastern side.

1821
01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:47.319
LIAM: So we'd have to get over or go all the way around.

1822
01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:49.411
MATT: Correct. You have to climb up and around the lava.

1823
01:08:49.411 --> 01:08:50.650
LAURA: Or we could carry people.

1824
01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:51.897
LIAM: Carry people, yeah, of course.

1825
01:08:51.897 --> 01:08:52.996
SAM: You said there's smoke rising from it,

1826
01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:54.534
but that it's not from lava.

1827
01:08:54.534 --> 01:08:55.466
MATT: There is no vent.

1828
01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:56.565
Well, you don't know where.

1829
01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:58.237
LIAM: I's not spilling out is what you said.

1830
01:08:58.237 --> 01:09:00.529
It's just a smoke stack or something like that.

1831
01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:03.599
LIAM and LAURA: (bird cawing)

1832
01:09:03.599 --> 01:09:05.356
LIAM: We understand each other.
LAURA: Totally.

1833
01:09:05.356 --> 01:09:06.764
SAM: What are you guys saying?

1834
01:09:06.764 --> 01:09:08.493
What are you guys talking about?

1835
01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:11.933
TALIESIN: Bird seed, bird stuff.

1836
01:09:11.933 --> 01:09:13.609
SAM: What do you think we should do?

1837
01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:15.302
LAURA: (squawking)

1838
01:09:15.302 --> 01:09:16.628
TRAVIS: Oh, goddamn it.

1839
01:09:16.628 --> 01:09:19.030
MATT: This is the next two hours of the campaign, guys.

1840
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.928
Buckle up.

1841
01:09:19.928 --> 01:09:22.269
TRAVIS: Crows and ravens in campaign one.

1842
01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:24.994
LIAM: I say in eagle to Jester to say: Fly Nott down

1843
01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.979
so she can see what we see.

1844
01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:27.812
LAURA: Okay.

1845
01:09:27.812 --> 01:09:28.776
LIAM: She can do the talking.

1846
01:09:28.776 --> 01:09:30.886
LIAM and LAURA: (squawking)

1847
01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:33.533
LAURA: So fucking stupid.

1848
01:09:33.533 --> 01:09:35.737
MATT: To illustrate, because the eagles technically

1849
01:09:35.737 --> 01:09:38.074
can't speak, they can understand Common and Auran.

1850
01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:41.248
LIAM: No, can't we speak to each other in, oh.

1851
01:09:41.248 --> 01:09:43.181
But we have the intelligence of the animal,

1852
01:09:43.181 --> 01:09:45.310
we don't understand our own language?

1853
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:47.959
MATT: It's not an eagle language, it's Auran,

1854
01:09:47.959 --> 01:09:51.014
which is a language of, you know, aarakocra

1855
01:09:51.014 --> 01:09:52.530
and other flying entities.

1856
01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:54.850
LIAM: My wisdom changes, but I don't-- ugh.

1857
01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:56.279
MATT: I know, I know.

1858
01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:57.697
LIAM: So many variations.

1859
01:09:57.697 --> 01:10:00.107
You, motherfucker, you could turn into anything

1860
01:10:00.107 --> 01:10:02.338
and understand everything, goddamn druid.

1861
01:10:02.338 --> 01:10:03.438
MATT: Druids are cool.

1862
01:10:03.438 --> 01:10:05.185
TALIESIN: You understand like eagle mating rituals

1863
01:10:05.185 --> 01:10:06.356
and things like that?

1864
01:10:06.356 --> 01:10:07.613
Could that become innate?

1865
01:10:07.613 --> 01:10:09.909
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.
TALIESIN: I'm sorry.

1866
01:10:09.909 --> 01:10:11.649
LIAM: No, but it can be learned.

1867
01:10:11.649 --> 01:10:15.001
SAM: Oh my god, you guys, you guys, there's smoke

1868
01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:16.460
coming from that outcropping.

1869
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.533
ALL: Hey!

1870
01:10:17.533 --> 01:10:19.783
(laughter)

1871
01:10:21.935 --> 01:10:25.066
MATT: All right, so, as the eagles return

1872
01:10:25.066 --> 01:10:27.083
to convey this information to you guys,

1873
01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:29.225
what would you like to do?

1874
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.946
SAM: Everybody, it's crazy, we should go up to that

1875
01:10:31.946 --> 01:10:33.650
and at least inspect it.

1876
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:37.398
I would say that on foot, it would take us about

1877
01:10:37.398 --> 01:10:38.599
how long to get there?

1878
01:10:38.599 --> 01:10:41.033
MATT: On foot, from where you are currently, about--

1879
01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:42.537
TRAVIS: 200 feet up and over.

1880
01:10:42.537 --> 01:10:44.311
MATT: Well, up and over and then the opposite

1881
01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:46.718
like far southern side of this mountain,

1882
01:10:46.718 --> 01:10:48.585
It'd be about another hour and a half.

1883
01:10:48.585 --> 01:10:51.326
SAM: We could get there just after dark.

1884
01:10:51.326 --> 01:10:53.061
LAURA: We could pick people up and carry them.

1885
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:54.494
SAM: Oh, we could ferry

1886
01:10:54.494 --> 01:10:56.161
back and forth.
LAURA: How fast would it be

1887
01:10:56.161 --> 01:10:57.486
if we ferry--
MATT: You guys are pretty fast,

1888
01:10:57.486 --> 01:10:58.660
because you're not bound

1889
01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.826
by the dangerous terrain in the mountains--

1890
01:11:00.826 --> 01:11:01.760
LAURA: Go one back at a time.

1891
01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.008
LIAM: Don't you mean: (bird squawk)?

1892
01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:03.857
LAURA: Yeah!

1893
01:11:03.857 --> 01:11:05.222
TALIESIN: -- keeps heading up that 200 feet,

1894
01:11:05.222 --> 01:11:08.397
and then the two eagles keep grabbing people,

1895
01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:10.933
taking them to the--

1896
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.397
LAURA: I don't say anything, I just go and pick up

1897
01:11:13.397 --> 01:11:15.459
Fjord and Beau.

1898
01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:18.066
MARISHA: Wait, what if it's a trap!

1899
01:11:18.066 --> 01:11:20.554
(laughter)

1900
01:11:20.554 --> 01:11:21.495
TALIESIN: Too late.

1901
01:11:21.495 --> 01:11:25.513
MATT: (whooshing), picking them up into the air,

1902
01:11:25.513 --> 01:11:28.127
you watch Jester just take off in her

1903
01:11:28.127 --> 01:11:29.733
bright blue eagle form.

1904
01:11:29.733 --> 01:11:31.828
LAURA: I'm like kind of a grayish blue.

1905
01:11:31.828 --> 01:11:33.943
I blend in with the sky a bit.

1906
01:11:33.943 --> 01:11:37.818
MATT: Sky blue eagle form, clutching

1907
01:11:37.818 --> 01:11:38.972
Beau and Fjord.
MARISHA: Wait, are you clutching

1908
01:11:38.972 --> 01:11:43.457
both of us? So Fjord and I are just like: It's cold!

1909
01:11:43.457 --> 01:11:44.923
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Real cold!

1910
01:11:44.923 --> 01:11:46.750
MATT: By the way, you're going to pretty fast

1911
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:49.436
against the storm, so it's like (impacting).

1912
01:11:49.436 --> 01:11:50.704
You're just being pelted with sleet.

1913
01:11:50.704 --> 01:11:52.187
TRAVIS: Not the way I thought this was going to go.

1914
01:11:52.187 --> 01:11:53.053
MARISHA: We're going to die.

1915
01:11:53.053 --> 01:11:55.215
MATT: Your faces are immediately numb.

1916
01:11:55.215 --> 01:11:57.393
There's frost forming up on your eyebrows

1917
01:11:57.393 --> 01:11:58.697
and the front of your hair.

1918
01:11:58.697 --> 01:12:01.410
LIAM: Caleb nudges his head underneath Nott's legs,

1919
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:04.103
scoops her up, and then both claws grasp Caduceus

1920
01:12:04.103 --> 01:12:04.936
by the shoulders.

1921
01:12:04.936 --> 01:12:06.564
TALIESIN: I pull down the hood.

1922
01:12:06.564 --> 01:12:08.266
MATT: Okay, you prepare yourself.

1923
01:12:08.266 --> 01:12:09.591
LIAM: Struggling though, he's heavy.

1924
01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:11.619
(whooshing)

1925
01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:15.522
MATT: All right, so, carrying around that, to make the pace,

1926
01:12:15.522 --> 01:12:18.418
fairly decent use of time.

1927
01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:20.813
You manage to get there-- I'd say it'd takes about

1928
01:12:20.813 --> 01:12:24.273
20 or so minutes of strong, continuous flight to get there.

1929
01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:27.874
The wind does pose a bit of a problem as the storm comes in.

1930
01:12:27.874 --> 01:12:31.159
I would like each of you, please, to make a strength check

1931
01:12:31.159 --> 01:12:32.676
using the eagles' strengths.

1932
01:12:32.676 --> 01:12:34.078
LIAM: Eagle stats, plus three.
LAURA: What are the--?

1933
01:12:34.078 --> 01:12:35.256
SAM: You've got them in front of you.

1934
01:12:35.256 --> 01:12:36.589
LAURA: Oh, (laughs). Thanks, Sam.

1935
01:12:36.589 --> 01:12:37.927
MATT: (laughs)

1936
01:12:37.927 --> 01:12:39.335
LIAM: 20 total.

1937
01:12:39.335 --> 01:12:40.642
TALIESIN: Ah!

1938
01:12:40.642 --> 01:12:41.912
LAURA: Everything's awful!

1939
01:12:41.912 --> 01:12:42.761
LIAM: What'd you get?

1940
01:12:42.761 --> 01:12:44.240
LAURA: Six total.

1941
01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.073
MATT: Six, okay.

1942
01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:45.987
And you got?

1943
01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:46.942
LIAM: 20 total.

1944
01:12:46.942 --> 01:12:48.357
MATT: 20, yeah.

1945
01:12:48.357 --> 01:12:51.321
Caduceus, you are carried without an issue

1946
01:12:51.321 --> 01:12:54.235
towards the perch. Jester, you're having a hard time

1947
01:12:54.235 --> 01:12:57.105
as the wind batters you once, twice,

1948
01:12:57.105 --> 01:12:59.701
and then a third time you spiral,

1949
01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:02.288
corkscrew for a moment, and return.

1950
01:13:02.288 --> 01:13:03.155
SAM: Uh-oh.

1951
01:13:03.155 --> 01:13:05.984
MATT: Your left claw a little bit lighter.

1952
01:13:05.984 --> 01:13:06.817
SAM: Oh no.

1953
01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:10.925
MATT: As Beauregard suddenly is released from your grasp.

1954
01:13:10.925 --> 01:13:13.457
You're like, (shouting).

1955
01:13:13.457 --> 01:13:14.290
MARISHA: (shouts)

1956
01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.627
LAURA: Can I fly after her and try to grab her up?

1957
01:13:16.627 --> 01:13:18.004
MATT: You can certainly try.

1958
01:13:18.912 --> 01:13:20.816
Now Beauregard is (whooshing).

1959
01:13:20.816 --> 01:13:22.673
You can barely see anything at this point now,

1960
01:13:22.673 --> 01:13:24.249
outside from the snow that's piercing by,

1961
01:13:24.249 --> 01:13:25.652
the clouds of smoke that's coming up,

1962
01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:27.371
and you're just spinning end over end,

1963
01:13:27.371 --> 01:13:29.918
plummeting through the middle of this snowstorm in the sky,

1964
01:13:29.918 --> 01:13:32.749
free falling, as you turn around to try and dive,

1965
01:13:32.749 --> 01:13:34.844
clutching Fjord, you get some Gs

1966
01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:37.040
as you're whipped around and then

1967
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.049
being dragged at full eagle speed

1968
01:13:39.049 --> 01:13:40.322
towards Beauregard down below.

1969
01:13:40.322 --> 01:13:41.358
SAM: Four G negative dive.

1970
01:13:41.358 --> 01:13:43.199
MATT: You've got one shot before impact here

1971
01:13:43.199 --> 01:13:47.959
because you were only about 150 above the ground.

1972
01:13:47.959 --> 01:13:49.575
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1973
01:13:49.575 --> 01:13:50.923
MATT: So--
LAURA: Oh god.

1974
01:13:50.923 --> 01:13:52.373
MATT: I will say...

1975
01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:56.564
knocked around at plummeting speed,

1976
01:13:56.564 --> 01:13:59.699
yeah, just go ahead and roll a d20 for me.

1977
01:13:59.699 --> 01:14:02.508
MARISHA: Am I totally like--

1978
01:14:02.508 --> 01:14:05.152
MATT: Unless you got something you want to try and do.

1979
01:14:05.152 --> 01:14:06.554
(gasps)

1980
01:14:06.554 --> 01:14:07.442
LAURA: 18.

1981
01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:08.275
MATT: 18.
SAM: Plus--

1982
01:14:08.275 --> 01:14:09.158
LAURA: Plus whatever.

1983
01:14:09.158 --> 01:14:10.424
MATT: No, I was just going to roll--

1984
01:14:10.424 --> 01:14:11.957
I was using death save rules,

1985
01:14:11.957 --> 01:14:13.702
like 10 or higher, you manage to succeed.

1986
01:14:13.702 --> 01:14:15.577
LAURA: God.

1987
01:14:15.577 --> 01:14:16.941
MATT: You can't see much, and you're

1988
01:14:16.941 --> 01:14:20.271
trying to right yourself, and using your monk training,

1989
01:14:20.271 --> 01:14:22.902
you put your arms and legs out, almost like how a cat falls

1990
01:14:22.902 --> 01:14:24.383
to catch itself--
TALIESIN: Flying squirrel.

1991
01:14:24.383 --> 01:14:26.628
MATT: To stop yourself from plummeting immediately,

1992
01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.508
but as you do, you're like okay, now I can focus,

1993
01:14:28.508 --> 01:14:31.121
that's the ground coming very rapidly at you!

1994
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:34.069
All of a sudden you feel claws grab you around your waist,

1995
01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:36.874
whoosh, and you're lifted up at a very steep arc,

1996
01:14:36.874 --> 01:14:39.295
as Jester manages to snatch you

1997
01:14:39.295 --> 01:14:41.405
from the possible jaws of doom.

1998
01:14:41.405 --> 01:14:44.192
MARISHA: I barf a little on the upswing.

1999
01:14:44.192 --> 01:14:46.004
(laughter)

2000
01:14:46.004 --> 01:14:47.360
TRAVIS: Where the fuck did you go?

2001
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.032
MARISHA: Where the fuck were you?!

2002
01:14:49.032 --> 01:14:50.972
(shouting)

2003
01:14:50.972 --> 01:14:52.271
(laughter)

2004
01:14:52.271 --> 01:14:53.788
LAURA: I like to imagine there's also a little Sprinkle

2005
01:14:53.788 --> 01:14:57.116
weasel crawling around in the feathers like (shouts).

2006
01:14:57.116 --> 01:14:58.176
(laughter)

2007
01:14:58.176 --> 01:15:00.350
LAURA: The whole time.

2008
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:01.929
MATT: Yeah.

2009
01:15:01.929 --> 01:15:03.363
TALIESIN: Just traumatized a weasel.

2010
01:15:03.363 --> 01:15:04.196
MATT: Oh yeah, that is--

2011
01:15:04.196 --> 01:15:05.821
TRAVIS: That's going on a t-shirt.

2012
01:15:05.821 --> 01:15:07.986
TALIESIN: That weasel's going to write a book after therapy.

2013
01:15:07.986 --> 01:15:08.819
MATT: That poor weasel.

2014
01:15:08.819 --> 01:15:10.203
LIAM: Get to the ground and Fjord's got a strange

2015
01:15:10.203 --> 01:15:12.431
diagonal speckled stripe on his face.

2016
01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:14.339
(laughter and groaning)

2017
01:15:14.339 --> 01:15:15.514
MATT: Frozen to it.

2018
01:15:15.514 --> 01:15:17.100
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Oh!

2019
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.843
LIAM: How's that for Armor of Agathys?

2020
01:15:18.843 --> 01:15:21.930
(laughter)

2021
01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:24.220
MARISHA: That weasel asked for none of this.

2022
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.376
LIAM: Armor of shit 'n' piss.

2023
01:15:25.376 --> 01:15:26.942
MATT: All right.

2024
01:15:26.942 --> 01:15:29.912
As the first batch settles down, you turn around to see,

2025
01:15:29.912 --> 01:15:34.600
a moment later, the blue eagle come to land

2026
01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.991
with two very haggard looking companions held from beneath

2027
01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:39.359
as you guys are both gently set down

2028
01:15:39.359 --> 01:15:42.276
on top of this dark stone platform.

2029
01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.010
SAM: We're right there on the platform

2030
01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:47.453
where the smoke was coming from?

2031
01:15:47.453 --> 01:15:49.277
MATT: Smoke's billowing out from the far side of it.

2032
01:15:49.277 --> 01:15:50.110
LAURA: Has it been about an hour,

2033
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:51.372
or has it been less than that?

2034
01:15:51.372 --> 01:15:52.327
MATT: A little less.

2035
01:15:52.327 --> 01:15:53.889
It was 20 minutes of travel, with looking--

2036
01:15:53.889 --> 01:15:55.427
it's been about 30 minutes or so.

2037
01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.212
You still have 30 minutes of Polymorph.

2038
01:15:57.212 --> 01:15:59.053
SAM: Just before dark.

2039
01:15:59.053 --> 01:16:02.142
I'll go run over and look at the smoke plume.

2040
01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:03.506
MATT: All right, so you glance over the edge,

2041
01:16:03.506 --> 01:16:06.132
and it's billowing up from the position,

2042
01:16:06.132 --> 01:16:07.848
so you'd probably want to go around

2043
01:16:07.848 --> 01:16:09.089
to see where the entranceway--

2044
01:16:09.089 --> 01:16:11.319
otherwise you're putting your head into the smoke.

2045
01:16:11.319 --> 01:16:13.193
SAM: You're right, yes. We'll go around and look.

2046
01:16:13.193 --> 01:16:14.898
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Sensible.

2047
01:16:14.898 --> 01:16:17.102
MATT: You glance down and look inside,

2048
01:16:17.102 --> 01:16:20.316
and what you see here is about a 20-foot-wide

2049
01:16:20.316 --> 01:16:24.894
half circle opening in the center.

2050
01:16:24.894 --> 01:16:28.511
Not natural. This has been hewn.

2051
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:33.510
It has a very deliberate arch to it from side to side.

2052
01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.542
The smoke that comes out of it seems to just be

2053
01:16:36.542 --> 01:16:39.541
riding along the top of what is a cavern that pours

2054
01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:41.694
deeper into the mountainside.

2055
01:16:41.694 --> 01:16:44.113
(croaks)

2056
01:16:44.113 --> 01:16:45.954
TALIESIN: Is this the-- have they just

2057
01:16:45.954 --> 01:16:48.760
hewn the stone? They haven't brought stone

2058
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.824
from anywhere. There's no crystals embedded in the wall

2059
01:16:52.824 --> 01:16:54.034
or anything yet?

2060
01:16:54.034 --> 01:16:54.867
MATT: No.

2061
01:16:54.867 --> 01:16:55.791
TALIESIN: Just a cavern opening.

2062
01:16:55.791 --> 01:16:58.482
SAM: Mr. Clay, this is a vent, right?

2063
01:16:58.482 --> 01:17:02.557
For the kiln. They must have hewn some vents

2064
01:17:02.557 --> 01:17:04.777
for their smoke to escape.

2065
01:17:04.777 --> 01:17:05.668
TALIESIN: Could be.

2066
01:17:05.668 --> 01:17:08.760
SAM: We could get into it from here.

2067
01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.400
TALIESIN: Could, although if you have it hewn for smoke,

2068
01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.483
I imagine that leads probably directly to the fire.

2069
01:17:14.483 --> 01:17:16.725
SAM: It could, it could, but if we have some way

2070
01:17:16.725 --> 01:17:20.933
of protecting us from that, maybe you or another magic user

2071
01:17:20.933 --> 01:17:22.635
could somehow protect us.

2072
01:17:22.635 --> 01:17:24.027
TALIESIN: I got nothing.

2073
01:17:24.027 --> 01:17:26.770
SAM: Well, maybe one of the eagles could.

2074
01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:29.732
But they're busy playing Hotel California.

2075
01:17:29.732 --> 01:17:32.200
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was hoping for that.

2076
01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.656
(laughter)

2077
01:17:33.656 --> 01:17:35.655
SAM: We're not going to do this tonight, or are we?

2078
01:17:35.655 --> 01:17:36.488
TALIESIN: Well.

2079
01:17:36.488 --> 01:17:39.335
SAM: We can go down and investigate tonight.

2080
01:17:40.601 --> 01:17:43.367
TALIESIN: It looks dangerous in there, doesn't it?

2081
01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.607
MATT: It's hard to tell.

2082
01:17:44.607 --> 01:17:45.440
I mean, it's--

2083
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.720
TALIESIN: How much heat's coming out of this?

2084
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.344
MATT: Judging just at this point,

2085
01:17:49.344 --> 01:17:50.960
it's not a vast amount of heat.

2086
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.069
It's warm, and definitely it's comforting

2087
01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:57.682
based on the chilled atmosphere that is currently

2088
01:17:57.682 --> 01:18:02.417
growing increasingly less and less serviceable for life

2089
01:18:02.417 --> 01:18:04.672
as the storm begins to increase in intensity.

2090
01:18:04.672 --> 01:18:06.761
SAM: This hole reminds me of something

2091
01:18:06.761 --> 01:18:09.284
that Jester was reading earlier.

2092
01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:13.177
I think the quote was, "and it was really deep."

2093
01:18:13.177 --> 01:18:14.577
LAURA: (caws)

2094
01:18:15.635 --> 01:18:17.261
TALIESIN: I don't get the--

2095
01:18:17.261 --> 01:18:19.697
SAM: Yeah, it was just for something that she read earlier.

2096
01:18:19.697 --> 01:18:21.991
TALIESIN: I heard it, but this is-- I mean,

2097
01:18:21.991 --> 01:18:23.635
this is just a hole in the ground--

2098
01:18:23.635 --> 01:18:24.499
TRAVIS: Let's check out the--

2099
01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.341
TALIESIN: Is that a metaphor connected to it?

2100
01:18:26.341 --> 01:18:28.618
What is the metaphor I'm missing?

2101
01:18:28.618 --> 01:18:29.451
LAURA: (caws)

2102
01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:30.306
MATT: Are you stepping in, Fjord?

2103
01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:32.113
TRAVIS: Yeah, I walk in.
LAURA: Can I, in eagle form, go--

2104
01:18:32.113 --> 01:18:32.946
SAM: We're going in?

2105
01:18:32.946 --> 01:18:34.296
MATT: Fjord just starts walking in.

2106
01:18:34.296 --> 01:18:35.902
SAM: Fjord, we going in?

2107
01:18:35.902 --> 01:18:38.477
TRAVIS: There's time to talk smut later. I'm going in.

2108
01:18:38.477 --> 01:18:39.582
SAM: I'm coming with.

2109
01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:42.499
LAURA: Can we fit as eagles, or do we need to--

2110
01:18:42.499 --> 01:18:45.099
MATT: The eagles, you can fit.

2111
01:18:45.099 --> 01:18:46.466
LAURA: Our awkward bird walks?

2112
01:18:46.466 --> 01:18:48.559
MATT: But yeah, I mean-- thankfully, it's a wide arch

2113
01:18:48.559 --> 01:18:51.711
and the cavern itself, it resembles that same

2114
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:54.717
half-circle archway, so it's wide,

2115
01:18:54.717 --> 01:18:56.859
but it's not high enough to the point

2116
01:18:56.859 --> 01:18:58.657
where you can fly, so it's like,

2117
01:18:58.657 --> 01:19:02.895
you have about a five-foot head span before--

2118
01:19:02.895 --> 01:19:05.220
TRAVIS: Two things, is it perfectly circular,

2119
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.295
or is it flat?

2120
01:19:06.295 --> 01:19:07.969
MATT: It's a flat floor, and it is

2121
01:19:07.969 --> 01:19:10.572
a domed half-circle interior.

2122
01:19:10.572 --> 01:19:13.959
TRAVIS: On the inside, is it slick with moisture or dry?

2123
01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:15.214
MATT: Dry.

2124
01:19:15.214 --> 01:19:17.798
MARISHA: Is the whole thing pouring smoke from the top?

2125
01:19:17.798 --> 01:19:20.974
MATT: There looks to be smoke that has gathered

2126
01:19:20.974 --> 01:19:23.801
along the top of it, so as you step in,

2127
01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:26.586
you stay a little low, because the smoke does--

2128
01:19:26.586 --> 01:19:29.114
the fume can fill the head space,

2129
01:19:29.114 --> 01:19:31.174
at your perfect standing height,

2130
01:19:31.174 --> 01:19:32.837
for most of you, you especially.

2131
01:19:32.837 --> 01:19:34.138
You have to get a little low

2132
01:19:34.138 --> 01:19:36.091
to get under the layer of heavy fume

2133
01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:37.492
to prevent you from coughing.
LAURA: So as birds, it's

2134
01:19:37.492 --> 01:19:38.883
just like up in our faces.
MATT: It's a little

2135
01:19:38.883 --> 01:19:39.716
rough for you guys.

2136
01:19:39.716 --> 01:19:41.441
You can keep your heads low, thankfully--

2137
01:19:41.441 --> 01:19:42.753
LAURA: I'm just going to drop.

2138
01:19:42.753 --> 01:19:45.329
MATT: Okay, so Jester drops the eagle form.

2139
01:19:45.329 --> 01:19:49.364
LAURA: I don't want the smoke in my hair feathers.

2140
01:19:49.364 --> 01:19:52.171
TRAVIS: Now we got Hedwig over here.

2141
01:19:52.171 --> 01:19:55.143
SAM: Caleb, are you going to come back to us?

2142
01:19:55.143 --> 01:19:57.049
(croaking)

2143
01:19:57.049 --> 01:19:58.137
TALIESIN: Light up and--

2144
01:19:58.137 --> 01:20:01.377
LIAM: Bird peck-peck-pecks the top of Nott's head.

2145
01:20:01.377 --> 01:20:05.050
And (whooshes), and Caleb just gives a little innocent

2146
01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:06.183
kiss to the top of her head.

2147
01:20:06.183 --> 01:20:07.642
LAURA: Aww.

2148
01:20:07.642 --> 01:20:08.888
SAM: All right, let's go.

2149
01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:09.721
MATT: Okay.

2150
01:20:11.418 --> 01:20:14.834
Continuing in, the dark interior of this cavern

2151
01:20:14.834 --> 01:20:18.251
begins to give way to a dull orange glow.

2152
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:23.850
Maybe 50 or 60 feet in, it begins to curve to the right

2153
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:27.267
as the light gets brighter, and brighter.

2154
01:20:29.093 --> 01:20:33.028
Eventually, you can see movement,

2155
01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:37.427
like a flicker, like a fire light source

2156
01:20:37.427 --> 01:20:39.394
from the inside.

2157
01:20:39.394 --> 01:20:42.352
The hallway opens up into a central chamber.

2158
01:20:42.352 --> 01:20:44.249
SAM: Ooh.

2159
01:20:44.249 --> 01:20:46.557
MATT: Within here, you can see

2160
01:20:46.557 --> 01:20:50.176
a spacious, open room,

2161
01:20:50.176 --> 01:20:53.776
itself domed on top, and you can see the channel

2162
01:20:53.776 --> 01:20:56.019
where the smoke is being funneled towards

2163
01:20:56.019 --> 01:20:58.578
based on the way it's carved on the inside.

2164
01:20:58.578 --> 01:21:01.693
There is, in the center, in the heart

2165
01:21:01.693 --> 01:21:06.506
of this interior grotto, a circular,

2166
01:21:06.506 --> 01:21:10.198
two-to-three-foot-high

2167
01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:12.214
metallic wall,

2168
01:21:12.214 --> 01:21:15.084
like a pool that is a container,

2169
01:21:15.084 --> 01:21:17.307
which in the center of it sits

2170
01:21:17.307 --> 01:21:21.772
boiling, heated molten rock.

2171
01:21:21.772 --> 01:21:23.410
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

2172
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:25.599
MATT: You can see black iron supports

2173
01:21:25.599 --> 01:21:29.682
that help maintain the structure of this interior chamber.

2174
01:21:29.682 --> 01:21:32.728
Almost like a gradual ribcage that continues

2175
01:21:32.728 --> 01:21:36.865
around the inside of it, to keep its structure sound.

2176
01:21:36.865 --> 01:21:39.545
The air in here is really warm.

2177
01:21:39.545 --> 01:21:42.990
Not uncomfortably hot, but you can feel a sweat starting

2178
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:47.025
to draw itself to your skin's surface.

2179
01:21:47.025 --> 01:21:50.753
The pool of lava that burns in the center there

2180
01:21:50.753 --> 01:21:53.638
is beneath a raised platform

2181
01:21:53.638 --> 01:21:56.723
that sits about two feet above it

2182
01:21:56.723 --> 01:21:59.656
and is attached to the opposite side of this chamber,

2183
01:21:59.656 --> 01:22:01.322
on its northern end,

2184
01:22:01.322 --> 01:22:04.788
and atop this extending,

2185
01:22:04.788 --> 01:22:06.958
long platform, you can see

2186
01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:10.572
a great black anvil that is affixed to the edge

2187
01:22:10.572 --> 01:22:14.431
right above the pool's surface,

2188
01:22:14.431 --> 01:22:19.198
and around it, dozens of chains dangle from the ceiling,

2189
01:22:19.198 --> 01:22:20.943
and at the end of these chains at different heights

2190
01:22:20.943 --> 01:22:23.878
are various tools and implements.

2191
01:22:23.878 --> 01:22:27.952
LIAM: Is the surface of this magma relatively still

2192
01:22:27.952 --> 01:22:29.714
or is it like (quick bubbling).

2193
01:22:29.714 --> 01:22:31.010
MATT: It's relatively still, but occasionally you get

2194
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:32.248
like a (slow bubble popping).

2195
01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:33.081
LIAM: Oh, okay.

2196
01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:36.532
MATT: It's not roiling, you know, heavily.

2197
01:22:36.532 --> 01:22:39.375
There are other tunnels that peer off from the central area,

2198
01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:40.908
and you can see,

2199
01:22:40.908 --> 01:22:44.583
sitting off to the side of the pool,

2200
01:22:44.583 --> 01:22:46.793
currently in the process of

2201
01:22:46.793 --> 01:22:51.441
whittling a piece of wood, a figure that's sitting.

2202
01:22:51.441 --> 01:22:54.220
Looks up in your direction, confused.

2203
01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:58.226
You see a dwarven female, older in her years,

2204
01:22:58.226 --> 01:23:03.124
white hair and olive skin, a body that is very muscular,

2205
01:23:03.124 --> 01:23:06.340
whether it be through genetic lineage

2206
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.695
or a lifetime of hard work.

2207
01:23:09.695 --> 01:23:13.787
Very intimidating grandmother of a dwarf.

2208
01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:17.856
Glances over in your direction, wearing these

2209
01:23:17.856 --> 01:23:22.672
gray robe, apron-type accoutrement,

2210
01:23:22.672 --> 01:23:24.847
bracers on,

2211
01:23:24.847 --> 01:23:26.468
and sitting there with a whittling knife

2212
01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.523
and a pile of wood,

2213
01:23:28.523 --> 01:23:33.364
and sets it to the side and goes, "Can I help you?"

2214
01:23:36.096 --> 01:23:37.013
TALIESIN: Possibly.

2215
01:23:38.928 --> 01:23:40.989
MATT: "Well, come here, come here.

2216
01:23:40.989 --> 01:23:42.300
"(groans)"

2217
01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.702
You see she stands up from the chair like this,

2218
01:23:43.702 --> 01:23:47.619
long, aching stand. "(groans)

2219
01:23:49.471 --> 01:23:52.338
"Oh, it's been a while.

2220
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.220
"Who are you?"

2221
01:23:58.898 --> 01:24:02.065
TALIESIN: My name is Caduceus Clay.

2222
01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:08.830
Would you be the keeper of this place?

2223
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:10.880
MATT: "Aye, one of many.

2224
01:24:12.982 --> 01:24:17.301
"Now when you say Clay, are you one of the Clay lot?"

2225
01:24:17.301 --> 01:24:20.587
TALIESIN: If you're of the Dust.

2226
01:24:20.587 --> 01:24:23.179
MATT: "Aye, I see this is a family meeting."

2227
01:24:23.179 --> 01:24:25.422
She comes over towards you.
TALIESIN: Going in for it.

2228
01:24:25.422 --> 01:24:28.241
MATT: Gives you this big angry dwarven hug

2229
01:24:28.241 --> 01:24:30.409
from underneath, which you loom over--

2230
01:24:30.409 --> 01:24:33.068
TALIESIN: I am kneeling for this.

2231
01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.490
I am kneeling for this.

2232
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:36.756
MATT: As you're patting, she's like, "Ah, care, careful

2233
01:24:36.756 --> 01:24:37.589
"with the back."
TALIESIN: Oh, very

2234
01:24:37.589 --> 01:24:39.006
carefully, yeah.

2235
01:24:39.006 --> 01:24:41.224
MATT: "(laughs)

2236
01:24:41.224 --> 01:24:43.455
"Well, we don't get visitors too much these days.

2237
01:24:43.455 --> 01:24:45.917
"This is very nice.

2238
01:24:45.917 --> 01:24:47.886
"Jeramess, Jeramess Dust."

2239
01:24:47.886 --> 01:24:49.110
TALIESIN: Jeramess.

2240
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:51.129
Jeramess, pleasure.

2241
01:24:51.129 --> 01:24:53.594
MATT: "I'm the keeper of the sanctum.

2242
01:24:53.594 --> 01:24:56.927
"I'm the grand matron of the Dust family.

2243
01:24:58.591 --> 01:25:00.965
"I've certainly seen a few Clays wander through here

2244
01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:03.288
"in recent years. I didn't know there was more coming."

2245
01:25:03.288 --> 01:25:04.971
TALIESIN: You did? You have?

2246
01:25:04.971 --> 01:25:05.948
MATT: "Aye."

2247
01:25:05.948 --> 01:25:07.630
TALIESIN: There have been more Clays wandering through?

2248
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:09.707
MATT: "There have been.

2249
01:25:09.707 --> 01:25:11.702
"Was it Constance and Corrin, I believe."

2250
01:25:11.702 --> 01:25:12.656
TALIESIN: (laughs)

2251
01:25:12.656 --> 01:25:14.221
LAURA: Are those your siblings?

2252
01:25:14.221 --> 01:25:15.873
TALIESIN: They're family, yeah.

2253
01:25:15.873 --> 01:25:18.193
MATT: "Came here seeking communion or something.

2254
01:25:18.193 --> 01:25:21.550
"Left lacking materials, it seems.

2255
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:23.475
"Rather vague and frustrated, they were.

2256
01:25:23.475 --> 01:25:25.374
"That was a few years ago."

2257
01:25:25.374 --> 01:25:29.367
TALIESIN: Did they come together, or were they separate?

2258
01:25:29.367 --> 01:25:30.904
MATT: "Well, they were separate."

2259
01:25:30.904 --> 01:25:31.948
TALIESIN: Okay.

2260
01:25:31.948 --> 01:25:33.150
MATT: "There was--"

2261
01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:34.300
TALIESIN: Mom and my aunt.

2262
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.700
MATT: "Younger Colton also came through.

2263
01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.956
"Seemed as confused as they did,

2264
01:25:38.956 --> 01:25:41.820
"and as you do, runs in the family."

2265
01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.407
TALIESIN: Well, we get that.

2266
01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:46.732
MATT: "Has been a few years since I've seen

2267
01:25:46.732 --> 01:25:48.403
"one of your kind.

2268
01:25:48.403 --> 01:25:50.570
"How are things down south?"

2269
01:25:53.215 --> 01:25:55.968
TALIESIN: Not improved, I suppose would be the--

2270
01:25:55.968 --> 01:25:57.832
MATT: "Same, then."

2271
01:25:57.832 --> 01:25:59.623
TALIESIN: How are things here?

2272
01:26:01.458 --> 01:26:03.965
I assume they told you why they came, and that the--

2273
01:26:03.965 --> 01:26:05.381
MATT: "Aye, that's right, yeah.

2274
01:26:05.381 --> 01:26:09.773
"The problem with the Savalirwood and your oh, strange.

2275
01:26:10.612 --> 01:26:12.160
"Strange indeed."

2276
01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:14.575
TALIESIN: Nothing like that here, then.

2277
01:26:14.575 --> 01:26:15.760
MATT: "No, no."

2278
01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.716
LAURA: Do you always have the, you know,

2279
01:26:17.716 --> 01:26:19.938
ghosts and stuff outside?

2280
01:26:19.938 --> 01:26:21.497
MATT: "Ah, yeah.

2281
01:26:22.838 --> 01:26:25.321
"You see, there's been a lot of individuals

2282
01:26:25.321 --> 01:26:27.310
"that have been interred here over the years,

2283
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:31.844
"and some have a place to pass on, some don't

01:26:31.844 --> 01:26:34.344
"and get taken by the planes below,

2285
01:26:34.344 --> 01:26:36.805
"and some just linger, so,

"don't worry about them, if you don't pay them any mind,

2287
01:26:39.214 --> 01:26:41.760
"they won't do any mind to you."

2288
01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.230
SAM: So this kiln is for burning bodies?

2289
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:47.046
MATT: "It's for many things, but that's one."

2290
01:26:47.046 --> 01:26:49.574
LIAM: We are The Mighty Nein, by the way.

2291
01:26:49.574 --> 01:26:51.504
We are Caduceus'--

2292
01:26:51.504 --> 01:26:52.654
MATT: "You're not all Clays?"

2293
01:26:52.654 --> 01:26:54.820
LIAM: No, we're his traveling companions.

2294
01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.128
MATT: "Good, was a bit confused."
MARISHA: Family friends.

2295
01:26:57.128 --> 01:26:58.660
MATT: "Right, right, okay, family friends,

2296
01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.814
"that's good, that's good."

2297
01:27:00.814 --> 01:27:04.040
SAM: Do people bring you bodies, or do you just--

2298
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.060
MATT: "Aye."

2299
01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.170
SAM: Like all the time?

2300
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:08.381
Because it seems like it's remote up here.

2301
01:27:08.381 --> 01:27:11.131
MATT: "Lesser and lesser as time goes on.

2302
01:27:11.131 --> 01:27:12.723
"You know, we get some folks from Uthodurn

2303
01:27:12.723 --> 01:27:15.416
"who have, you know, want to be left

2304
01:27:15.416 --> 01:27:19.198
"with the pride of the Allfather or the Wildmother,

01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:25.119
"to be brought to dust, and then left to

2307
01:27:25.983 --> 01:27:29.137
"find their destiny in the afterlife."

2308
01:27:29.137 --> 01:27:30.678
LIAM: Ertherder is what she said?

2309
01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:32.886
MATT: Uthodurn.
SAM: That's the elven-dwarven place.

2310
01:27:32.886 --> 01:27:34.801
LIAM: It was in the brogue.

2311
01:27:37.148 --> 01:27:40.016
TALIESIN: You haven't seen a Stone wander through here

2312
01:27:40.016 --> 01:27:42.283
in recent years, have you?

2313
01:27:42.283 --> 01:27:46.804
MATT: "Oh, no, no Stones, they keep themselves way south."

2314
01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:50.294
TALIESIN: I've never had one, in my memory, anyway,

2315
01:27:50.294 --> 01:27:51.875
where we come from, or at least if they did,

2316
01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:54.436
they didn't make themselves known to me.

2317
01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:56.132
MATT: "Well, to be honest, we haven't really had

2318
01:27:56.132 --> 01:27:57.972
"any Clays come by in a long time,

2319
01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:00.920
"or at all, (laughter) until recently."

2320
01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.345
TALIESIN: How much news of the outside world

2321
01:28:03.345 --> 01:28:04.720
do you get up here?

2322
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.481
MATT: "Not too much, beyond what the dreams

2323
01:28:07.481 --> 01:28:10.682
"from Melora come to us, and what the folks from Uthodurn

01:28:10.682 --> 01:28:13.445
"come forward and you know, share with us

2325

"when they bring their family, or they're just

01:28:16.002 --> 01:28:19.442
"looking to learn and craft," and she makes a motion

2327
01:28:19.442 --> 01:28:20.758
up toward the forge.

2328
01:28:20.758 --> 01:28:22.243
TALIESIN: Beautiful.

2329
01:28:22.243 --> 01:28:25.750
MARISHA: Do you cremate bodies in the same lava pools

2330
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:28.415
that you forge weapons, or do you like

2331
01:28:28.415 --> 01:28:32.331
keep it separate for sanitation reasons?

2332
01:28:32.331 --> 01:28:33.298
MATT: "Sanitation?

2333
01:28:33.298 --> 01:28:34.882
"It's fucking fire."

2334
01:28:34.882 --> 01:28:36.899
TRAVIS: Yeah. This is liquid steel.

2335
01:28:36.899 --> 01:28:37.846
MATT: "Yeah, it's all the same."

2336
01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:38.679
MARISHA: But I mean, it's--

2337
01:28:38.679 --> 01:28:41.386
LIAM: That's as clean as it gets.

2338
01:28:41.386 --> 01:28:43.930
MARISHA: It's just heeby-jeeby.

2339
01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:46.954
TALIESIN: What would you hope for?

2340
01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:49.154
MARISHA: I was just curious if there was like a system.

2341
01:28:49.154 --> 01:28:51.565
TRAVIS: You think they're putting people in the weapons?

2342
01:28:51.565 --> 01:28:52.978
LAURA: That's really cool!

2343
01:28:52.978 --> 01:28:54.500
MARISHA: Kind of.

2344
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.241
MATT: "I mean, depending where you place your interests,

2345
01:28:57.241 --> 01:29:00.606
"maybe, but keep in mind, when the soul's gone,

2346
01:29:00.606 --> 01:29:03.501
"a body's really just meat."

2347
01:29:03.501 --> 01:29:05.622
LAURA: Do you eat people?
TRAVIS: Okay.

2348
01:29:05.622 --> 01:29:07.350
MATT: "No."
LAURA: Okay.

2349
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:08.775
He drinks them.

2350
01:29:08.775 --> 01:29:11.231
TALIESIN: Well, they're tea.

2351
01:29:11.231 --> 01:29:12.927
LIAM: This is escalating quickly.

2352
01:29:12.927 --> 01:29:15.570
TALIESIN: It's, we'll get into it later.

2353
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:16.932
Are you alone up here?

2354
01:29:16.932 --> 01:29:19.761
MATT: "No, no, no, got some family, yeah."

2355
01:29:19.761 --> 01:29:21.588
(clapping)

2356
01:29:21.588 --> 01:29:22.864
And claps loudly.

2357
01:29:22.864 --> 01:29:25.614
"Come on, we've got company again!"

2358
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.984
TALIESIN: (sighs)

2359
01:29:27.984 --> 01:29:30.118
MATT: A little bit of time passes, and you see

2360
01:29:30.118 --> 01:29:32.259
a younger female dwarf emerge from

2361
01:29:32.259 --> 01:29:34.525
one of the tunnels off to the side.

2362
01:29:34.525 --> 01:29:37.431
You can see blonde, tangled hair

2363
01:29:37.431 --> 01:29:41.482
over her olive skin, emerges and goes, "What's that?

2364
01:29:41.482 --> 01:29:44.344
"Oh, oh, we've got a few, don't we?

2365
01:29:44.344 --> 01:29:45.712
"Okay.

2366
01:29:45.712 --> 01:29:48.092
"I'm Tyla, Tyla Dust."

2367
01:29:48.092 --> 01:29:49.091
TALIESIN: Tyla.

2368
01:29:49.091 --> 01:29:52.176
MATT: "I'm the lorekeeper of the kiln

2369
01:29:52.176 --> 01:29:55.329
"and the Cinderrest Sanctum.

2370
01:29:55.329 --> 01:29:56.621
"Burning Lodge.

2371
01:29:56.621 --> 01:29:58.632
"Welcome."

2372
01:29:58.632 --> 01:30:01.381
TALIESIN: Caduceus Clay, pleasure to meet you.

2373
01:30:01.381 --> 01:30:04.782
MATT: "Oh, that is, from the Clays again, we have another."

2374
01:30:04.782 --> 01:30:06.423
TALIESIN: Been hearing that.
MATT: "Interesting."

2375
01:30:06.423 --> 01:30:08.550
LAURA: Do the Stones ever come?

2376
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:11.592
MATT: "No Stones in my time, sorry."

2377
01:30:11.592 --> 01:30:16.592
TALIESIN: How were the Clays coming through,

2378
01:30:16.617 --> 01:30:20.835
Constance and Corrin especially, did they--

2379
01:30:20.835 --> 01:30:24.763
MATT: "I talked with them a bit more than Mum did."

2380
01:30:24.763 --> 01:30:26.142
TALIESIN: They all right?

2381
01:30:26.142 --> 01:30:27.646
MATT: "They seemed fine, a bit perturbed,

2382
01:30:27.646 --> 01:30:29.946
"and you know, looking for answers,

2383
01:30:29.946 --> 01:30:34.196
"and they were looking for some kind of glass stuff."

2384
01:30:35.222 --> 01:30:37.185
TALIESIN: Glass stuff.

2385
01:30:37.185 --> 01:30:41.102
MATT: "They said they had visions of some materials."

2386
01:30:42.817 --> 01:30:44.984
TALIESIN: You're lore keeper?

2387
01:30:44.984 --> 01:30:45.859
MATT: "I am."

2388
01:30:45.859 --> 01:30:48.334
TALIESIN: That means that whatever you talked about with

2389
01:30:48.334 --> 01:30:50.627
them probably got written down?

2390
01:30:50.627 --> 01:30:52.568
MATT: "Aye, aye."

2391
01:30:52.568 --> 01:30:55.026
TALIESIN: I don't mean to presume anything,

2392
01:30:55.026 --> 01:30:58.488
but if it would be possible to get some specifics

2393
01:30:58.488 --> 01:31:02.554
of what my mother and my aunt and siblings

2394
01:31:02.554 --> 01:31:04.152
may have talked about. It's been many years

2395
01:31:04.152 --> 01:31:06.662
since I've seen them. They've not returned,

2396
01:31:06.662 --> 01:31:10.096
and any clues to their whereabouts

2397
01:31:10.096 --> 01:31:12.996
or their leads on saving our home temple

2398
01:31:12.996 --> 01:31:16.787
would be priceless.

2399
01:31:17.899 --> 01:31:20.845
I'd be happy, of course, nothing for nothing,

2400
01:31:20.845 --> 01:31:23.070
but anything that you need, or any service

2401
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:26.714
that I could provide, as our families are so

2402
01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:31.080
inevitably linked, I would be happy to share with you.

2403
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:34.108
We do come on business as well, there are things that

2404
01:31:34.108 --> 01:31:36.981
I was hoping to discuss, but this is--

2405
01:31:36.981 --> 01:31:39.205
MATT: "Of course, any questions you've got, please ask,

2406
01:31:39.205 --> 01:31:41.482
"I mean, we're happy to have company."

2407
01:31:41.482 --> 01:31:44.503
TRAVIS: You said the Stones stay further south?

2408
01:31:44.503 --> 01:31:45.850
MATT: "I think so."

2409
01:31:45.850 --> 01:31:47.474
TRAVIS: Do you know how much further south?

2410
01:31:47.474 --> 01:31:49.077
We've come from there.

2411
01:31:49.077 --> 01:31:50.536
MATT: "Don't really know, went our own ways

2412
01:31:50.536 --> 01:31:52.880
"back in the day, and haven't really visited them,

2413
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.306
"haven't visited us, we've all had our own things to do.

2414
01:31:55.306 --> 01:31:57.493
"No offense, you're not really looking forward to going

2415
01:31:57.493 --> 01:32:00.516
"to the Savalirwood, so we just kept to our own."

2416
01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:03.150
TALIESIN: That's fair, again, it took us an awful long time

2417
01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:04.009
to come here, too.

2418
01:32:04.009 --> 01:32:06.409
MATT: "Yeah, but you did eventually, it was nice."

2419
01:32:06.409 --> 01:32:07.974
TALIESIN: It had to happen.

2420
01:32:07.974 --> 01:32:09.252
SAM: What's in the Savalirwood?

2421
01:32:09.252 --> 01:32:11.885
Is that where we found you, right?

2422
01:32:11.885 --> 01:32:15.226
We came from there, and then we went away,

2423
01:32:15.226 --> 01:32:16.059
and then we went back.

2424
01:32:16.059 --> 01:32:17.053
TRAVIS: Well, that's where he's from.

2425
01:32:17.053 --> 01:32:19.023
SAM: Yeah, I know, but how far is the Savalirwood

2426
01:32:19.023 --> 01:32:21.328
from where we are right now?

2427
01:32:21.328 --> 01:32:23.484
No, I know, but like, in--

2428
01:32:23.484 --> 01:32:24.757
TRAVIS: Oh, in real distance?

2429
01:32:24.757 --> 01:32:26.978
SAM: In real distance.
MATT: It's about 200 miles.

2430
01:32:26.978 --> 01:32:29.384
SAM: Wow, so we've been close to this before.

2431
01:32:29.384 --> 01:32:31.601
MATT: You were on the cusp of this region, yeah.

2432
01:32:31.601 --> 01:32:33.434
TALIESIN: It's a rough travel.

2433
01:32:34.363 --> 01:32:38.524
SAM: Why would they come to you looking for glass?

2434
01:32:38.524 --> 01:32:41.597
MATT: "I don't know, they said they had some sort of visions

2435
01:32:41.597 --> 01:32:43.864
"from the Wildmother, trying to guide them."

2436
01:32:43.864 --> 01:32:45.005
SAM: Do you make glass here?

2437
01:32:45.005 --> 01:32:46.271
MATT: "No."
SAM: Have you?

2438
01:32:46.271 --> 01:32:48.607
Because you could, you know, you have the heat.

2439
01:32:48.607 --> 01:32:49.698
MATT: "Right, but,

2440
01:32:51.434 --> 01:32:54.459
"it's not the kind that they were looking for, at least."

2441
01:32:54.459 --> 01:32:55.785
MARISHA: Dungeon Master.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2442
01:32:55.785 --> 01:32:57.870
MARISHA: Can you remind us what the blade

2443
01:32:57.870 --> 01:33:01.895
of the Star Razor was made out of?

2444
01:33:01.895 --> 01:33:03.042
SAM: Metal, or?

2445
01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:03.917
MATT: It's made out of metal.

2446
01:33:03.917 --> 01:33:05.289
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

2447
01:33:05.289 --> 01:33:07.218
TALIESIN: It's not glass.
MARISHA: Not glass.

2448
01:33:07.218 --> 01:33:11.379
TALIESIN: We do have a piece that may need reforging,

2449
01:33:11.379 --> 01:33:16.312
and I would be curious to

2450
01:33:16.312 --> 01:33:18.053
see your process here,

2451
01:33:18.053 --> 01:33:19.772
I don't suppose that you have anyone

2452
01:33:19.772 --> 01:33:22.319
that you're expecting to feed to the fire anytime soon,

2453
01:33:22.319 --> 01:33:27.132
but I would love to learn as much as I can while I'm here,

2454
01:33:27.132 --> 01:33:29.943
about what you do.
MATT: "All right.

2455
01:33:29.943 --> 01:33:33.971
"I mean, well, welcome to the Underforge as well."

2456
01:33:33.971 --> 01:33:35.885
And Tyla points over to it.

2457
01:33:35.885 --> 01:33:37.985
You can see on the base of it,

2458
01:33:37.985 --> 01:33:41.585
the metal and stone wall that contains the magma,

2459
01:33:41.585 --> 01:33:45.882
there is a plaque that reads, "Dust you shall take,

2460
01:33:45.882 --> 01:33:47.678
"and what remains of this forgotten hero

2461
01:33:47.678 --> 01:33:49.226
"and walk the mountains until a cave

2462
01:33:49.226 --> 01:33:52.206
"of onyx wall and liquid stone is found.

2463
01:33:52.206 --> 01:33:53.620
"There you shall burn what remains

2464
01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.613
"and the ashes shall be mixed into brick and ink and steel

2465
01:33:55.613 --> 01:33:58.921
"so that what is made shall hold my mark.

2466
01:33:58.921 --> 01:34:00.756
"Upon this site you shall build a kiln

2467
01:34:00.756 --> 01:34:02.715
"whose creation shall be my gift to the Allhammer

2468
01:34:02.715 --> 01:34:04.867
"to remind him that nature is material.

2469
01:34:04.867 --> 01:34:07.117
"Decree of the Wildmother."

2470
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:11.419
TALIESIN: Amazing, just amazing.

2471
01:34:11.419 --> 01:34:13.215
MATT: "Khemdal's around her somewhere."

2472
01:34:13.215 --> 01:34:14.048
TALIESIN: Kendall?

2473
01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:15.131
MATT: "My brother."

2474
01:34:16.466 --> 01:34:19.030
TALIESIN: Excellent, I would love to meet all of them.

2475
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:23.034
We've traveled quite a bit, I'm sure we're a little tired,

2476
01:34:23.034 --> 01:34:24.504
if it would be possible to stay the night,

2477
01:34:24.504 --> 01:34:25.337
at the very least.

2478
01:34:25.337 --> 01:34:26.170
MATT: "Oh, certainly."

2479
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:28.555
LAURA: What kind of quarters do you guys have here?

2480
01:34:28.555 --> 01:34:29.680
MATT: "We don't really have much

2481
01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.721
"in the way of guest quarters,

2482
01:34:30.721 --> 01:34:34.929
"but Ichabod is still out with our sons,

2483
01:34:34.929 --> 01:34:37.070
Brum, Brumhelm,

2484
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:39.325
"and they're off to Uthodurn."

2485
01:34:39.325 --> 01:34:41.202
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: "Doing a little supply run."

2486
01:34:41.202 --> 01:34:44.048
TALIESIN: How is Uthodurn? We haven't--

2487
01:34:44.048 --> 01:34:46.687
MATT: "It's a lot of people.

2488
01:34:46.687 --> 01:34:48.994
"Not my kind, I like the quiet.

2489
01:34:48.994 --> 01:34:53.340
"But, you know, it's close by, comparatively,

2490
01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:54.398
"it's got things that we obviously don't have

2491
01:34:54.398 --> 01:34:55.540
"access to here,

2492
01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.604
"and so we do often, you know, there's some folks

2493
01:34:58.604 --> 01:35:00.827
"come to us to trade and sell, or we go over there

2494
01:35:00.827 --> 01:35:03.093
"and do the same, and when things run low,

2495
01:35:03.093 --> 01:35:04.896
"we have to make a journey ourselves, that kind of deal."

2496
01:35:04.896 --> 01:35:06.235
TRAVIS: How far is that journey?

2497
01:35:06.235 --> 01:35:10.044
MATT: "It's maybe a day and a half travel, not too far."

2498
01:35:10.044 --> 01:35:12.109
TALIESIN: That might be on the way out.

2499
01:35:12.109 --> 01:35:12.942
LAURA: Hmm.

2500
01:35:12.942 --> 01:35:16.339
I was really hoping that Traveler Con would have like,

2501
01:35:16.339 --> 01:35:18.942
a hotel nearby or something, but this is

2502
01:35:18.942 --> 01:35:20.451
a little more difficult.

2503
01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:22.354
SAM: Is this where Traveler Con's happening?

2504
01:35:22.354 --> 01:35:24.891
TALIESIN: I thought that was a different volcano.

2505
01:35:24.891 --> 01:35:28.093
LAURA: Well, I thought about this volcano.

2506
01:35:28.093 --> 01:35:30.278
MATT: The vision that you were given

2507
01:35:30.278 --> 01:35:33.507
from the Wildmother, the one that began to give you

2508
01:35:33.507 --> 01:35:36.560
flashes of this, elements of it keep sparking

2509
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.919
in your memory.
TALIESIN: Oh.

2510
01:35:37.919 --> 01:35:39.827
MATT: There was one that involved

2511
01:35:39.827 --> 01:35:43.660
taking these shards of

2512
01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.060
green glass-like material

2513
01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.803
and placing them within the fire,

2514
01:35:48.803 --> 01:35:51.303
and they would be transformed.

2515
01:35:52.214 --> 01:35:56.469
TALIESIN: We do not have green glass, if I recall.

2516
01:35:56.469 --> 01:35:59.372
LAURA: Wait, what about that bag that you took?

2517
01:35:59.372 --> 01:36:00.205
SAM: What bag?

2518
01:36:00.205 --> 01:36:02.885
LAURA: Don't you have a bag of green stone?

2519
01:36:02.885 --> 01:36:05.968
SAM: I have a bag of green dust, yes.

2520
01:36:09.321 --> 01:36:11.064
LAURA: Does it look like it could have been

2521
01:36:11.064 --> 01:36:13.169
crushed glassy sort of stuff?

2522
01:36:13.169 --> 01:36:14.087
SAM: I don't know, does it?

2523
01:36:14.087 --> 01:36:17.455
LAURA: That bag of green dust that she took?

2524
01:36:17.455 --> 01:36:18.859
MATT: Oh, which bag?

2525
01:36:18.859 --> 01:36:20.269
SAM: My bag of residuum.

2526
01:36:20.269 --> 01:36:21.584
MATT: Residuum, okay.

2527
01:36:21.584 --> 01:36:24.057
You take it out and glance at it.

2528
01:36:24.057 --> 01:36:25.292
Do you show it to Clay?

2529
01:36:25.292 --> 01:36:27.065
SAM: Sure, Clay?

2530
01:36:27.065 --> 01:36:31.355
Jester thinks that this green powder is green glass.

2531
01:36:31.355 --> 01:36:35.947
MATT: It does have a very, very similar color.

2532
01:36:40.904 --> 01:36:43.559
TALIESIN: How angry would you be if I tried?

2533
01:36:43.559 --> 01:36:45.148
SAM: To snort it?

2534
01:36:45.148 --> 01:36:48.244
TALIESIN: (laughs) That looks painful, no.

2535
01:36:48.244 --> 01:36:49.771
No, to--

2536
01:36:49.771 --> 01:36:53.888
SAM: To do an alchemical work on it?

2537
01:36:53.888 --> 01:36:57.434
Of course, I would be happy to assist.

2538
01:36:57.434 --> 01:37:00.075
TALIESIN: What is alchemical?

2539
01:37:00.075 --> 01:37:02.069
LIAM: Well, it's taking natural things,

2540
01:37:02.069 --> 01:37:05.931
but doing a lot more measuring and tinkering,

2541
01:37:05.931 --> 01:37:09.795
with things that don't mix in nature normally.

2542
01:37:09.795 --> 01:37:12.636
TALIESIN: I think maybe

2543
01:37:12.636 --> 01:37:17.636
we need to feed that to the fire.

2544
01:37:17.874 --> 01:37:20.598
I think maybe it might even have something,

2545
01:37:20.598 --> 01:37:25.248
I pull out the broken sword,

2546
01:37:25.248 --> 01:37:27.140
show them what I have.

2547
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.530
MATT: "I'm going to need Khemdal for this,

2548
01:37:28.530 --> 01:37:31.111
"I'm just a lorekeeper here, this is more, Khemdal!"

2549
01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:33.609
Eventually you see coming through.

2550
01:37:33.609 --> 01:37:34.916
LAURA: I thought it was Kendall.

2551
01:37:34.916 --> 01:37:36.284
MATT: Khemdal.

2552
01:37:36.284 --> 01:37:39.300
Grabbing his head, you can see the

2553
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:43.604
dwarf brother to Tyla

2554
01:37:43.604 --> 01:37:44.759
come through.

2555
01:37:44.759 --> 01:37:47.385
Short blond hair, mutton chops curled into

2556
01:37:47.385 --> 01:37:49.193
a finely groomed mustache.

2557
01:37:49.193 --> 01:37:50.665
LAURA: Sweet.

2558
01:37:50.665 --> 01:37:55.665
MATT: Comes-- "(groans) Right, I heard you calling.

2559
01:37:56.208 --> 01:37:59.282
"What's the-- oh, who are these people?"

2560
01:37:59.282 --> 01:38:00.865
SAM: Clay and friends.

2561
01:38:02.379 --> 01:38:05.175
MATT: "Hi, Khemdal Dust.

2562
01:38:05.175 --> 01:38:06.250
"What, um--

2563
01:38:07.266 --> 01:38:08.504
"what you need?"

2564
01:38:08.504 --> 01:38:09.965
TALIESIN: We have a lot.

2565
01:38:09.965 --> 01:38:14.779
I know that my family was here talking about glass,

2566
01:38:14.779 --> 01:38:18.446
and it occurs to us that this maybe could be

2567
01:38:19.965 --> 01:38:23.576
what they were talking about, and we have a broken sword.

2568
01:38:23.576 --> 01:38:25.596
Where do I even begin?

2569
01:38:25.596 --> 01:38:29.854
Things are complicated out in the south.

2570
01:38:31.713 --> 01:38:33.021
The world is--

2571
01:38:35.884 --> 01:38:39.423
The world is being unkind to the natural world right now.

2572
01:38:39.423 --> 01:38:42.229
LAURA: And this big ugly guy named the Laughing Hand,

2573
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:45.046
he got loose, and Clay thinks that maybe

2574
01:38:45.046 --> 01:38:47.168
that the the sword that we can reforge

2575
01:38:47.168 --> 01:38:49.772
will help defeat him, because he's really hard to beat.

2576
01:38:49.772 --> 01:38:53.810
MATT: Khemdal takes the sword and goes like, "Ah.

2577
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:56.650
"I mean, this is very fine Uthodurnian craft,

2578
01:38:56.650 --> 01:38:59.322
"at least it was added to it.

2579
01:38:59.322 --> 01:39:04.318
"You can see the base very plainly is not Uthodurnian,

2580
01:39:04.318 --> 01:39:08.568
but it has been further refined by that matter,

2581
01:39:08.568 --> 01:39:11.349
"but the old blade is snapped in the center.

2582
01:39:11.349 --> 01:39:13.323
"And I keep the forge, you know,

2583
01:39:13.323 --> 01:39:15.385
"but I'm not a master craftsman.

2584
01:39:15.385 --> 01:39:19.243
"This is, oh, this looks like--

2585
01:39:19.243 --> 01:39:21.077
this looks like Dulgrim make."

2586
01:39:21.077 --> 01:39:22.501
SAM: A what?
TRAVIS: Dulgrim?

2587
01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:23.334
MATT: "Dulgrim?"

2588
01:39:23.334 --> 01:39:25.919
TALIESIN: Is that on the map?
SAM: That's the sword maker?

2589
01:39:25.919 --> 01:39:27.113
MATT: "Could be.

2590
01:39:27.113 --> 01:39:29.549
"He's come back here many times making--"

2591
01:39:29.549 --> 01:39:31.085
SAM: Dulgrim?
MATT: "Dulgrim."

2592
01:39:31.085 --> 01:39:33.434
LAURA: Does he live in Uthodurn?

2593
01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:37.819
MATT: No, you guys recall, Dulgrim Smeltborne

2594
01:39:37.819 --> 01:39:39.595
was the name that came up.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2595
01:39:39.595 --> 01:39:42.430
MATT: Now he goes, "I haven't seen him for some time,

2596
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:44.824
"but he's from Uthodurn."

2597
01:39:44.824 --> 01:39:46.561
TALIESIN: Good to know.

2598
01:39:46.561 --> 01:39:48.236
Good reason to go.

2599
01:39:48.236 --> 01:39:49.174
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2600
01:39:49.174 --> 01:39:52.348
TALIESIN: So this isn't something that
can be fixed here, then.

2601
01:39:52.348 --> 01:39:54.827
MATT: "It's not my specialty.

2602
01:39:54.827 --> 01:39:56.466
"Probably have to talk to him."

2603
01:39:56.466 --> 01:40:00.024
TALIESIN: What about this?
And I'm going to show the residuum,

2604
01:40:00.024 --> 01:40:01.691
the bag of residuum.

2605
01:40:02.768 --> 01:40:03.876
MATT: "Tyla.

2606
01:40:04.928 --> 01:40:06.555
"You take a look at this?"

2607
01:40:06.555 --> 01:40:09.472
She looks over and puts her hands through it.

2608
01:40:09.472 --> 01:40:14.472
"This is residuum, but I mean, it's in its fine form.

2609
01:40:15.148 --> 01:40:17.843
"What are you looking for?"

2610
01:40:17.843 --> 01:40:21.435
SAM: He said he saw visions of glass.

2611
01:40:21.435 --> 01:40:26.435
TALIESIN: Could this be the glass
that my family talked about?

2612
01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:29.628
MATT: "Hold on a second," and she goes through

2613
01:40:29.628 --> 01:40:32.330
and leaves for a moment and then comes back with a book

2614
01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:34.663
and starts thumbing through.

2615
01:40:38.859 --> 01:40:40.599
TALIESIN: They've got books.

2616
01:40:40.599 --> 01:40:45.174
MATT: "Right, so residuum, right, right.

2617
01:40:45.174 --> 01:40:49.415
"Powerful, very very basic

2618
01:40:49.415 --> 01:40:51.965
"arcane material.

2619
01:40:51.965 --> 01:40:56.754
"Harnesses-- can be utilized to replace

2620
01:40:56.754 --> 01:41:01.045
"and act as other expensive-type

2621
01:41:01.045 --> 01:41:02.753
"materials and components

2622
01:41:02.753 --> 01:41:07.023
"for spells and uses. Very good to know, very important.

2623
01:41:07.023 --> 01:41:09.356
"From what I can tell here--

2624
01:41:10.952 --> 01:41:12.756
"(sighs)

2625
01:41:12.756 --> 01:41:16.447
"Interesting, all right, so the glass that you're asking for

2626
01:41:16.447 --> 01:41:18.938
"is refined residuum.

2627
01:41:18.938 --> 01:41:20.112
"It's a rare material

2628
01:41:20.112 --> 01:41:22.223
"this side of Exandria, unfortunately.

2629
01:41:22.223 --> 01:41:25.549
"The primary source is a place
called Whitestone in Tal'Dorei,

2630
01:41:25.549 --> 01:41:29.032
"but they export in small batches.

2631
01:41:29.032 --> 01:41:31.237
"(sighs)"

2632
01:41:31.237 --> 01:41:32.737
SAM: Can you make it?

2633
01:41:35.087 --> 01:41:37.213
MATT: "Not much I know about that, unfortunately."

2634
01:41:37.213 --> 01:41:39.993
LAURA: We probably need to go to
Whitestone to get it, then?

2635
01:41:39.993 --> 01:41:40.826
SAM: Well, no--

2636
01:41:40.826 --> 01:41:44.205
TRAVIS: Couldn't you melt it down--
SAM: Yeah, I'm familiar with--

2637
01:41:44.205 --> 01:41:45.323
MATT: "You can certainly try."

2638
01:41:45.323 --> 01:41:48.103
SAM: The basics of making glass.
MATT: "By all means."

2639
01:41:48.103 --> 01:41:51.445
SAM: We could try.

2640
01:41:51.445 --> 01:41:55.891
TALIESIN: Do I recall, is this the
kiln I saw in the vision?

2641
01:41:55.891 --> 01:41:58.456
Like, this is--
SAM: No, different one.

2642
01:41:58.456 --> 01:42:00.540
MATT: You remember this pool.

2643
01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:05.457
TALIESIN: There could be multiples in
the building, you don't know.

2644
01:42:08.376 --> 01:42:10.587
TRAVIS: What could it hurt, come on.

2645
01:42:10.587 --> 01:42:12.289
TALIESIN: I'm nothing if not a believer in a leap of faith.

2646
01:42:12.289 --> 01:42:14.206
LAURA: Yeah. Try to make glass out of it.

2647
01:42:14.206 --> 01:42:19.206
TALIESIN: I'm going to act out what I saw in my dream.

2648
01:42:19.814 --> 01:42:21.409
MATT: Okay.

2649
01:42:21.409 --> 01:42:22.978
MARISHA: Do you need help?
TALIESIN: As best I can.

2650
01:42:22.978 --> 01:42:23.831
SAM: Act out?

2651
01:42:23.831 --> 01:42:25.672
What did you see in your dream?

2652
01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:28.162
MARISHA: Do an interpretive dance first.

2653
01:42:28.162 --> 01:42:31.251
TALIESIN: It was dropping the glass into the pool.

2654
01:42:31.251 --> 01:42:32.271
MATT: Correct.

2655
01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:34.942
LAURA: Should Nott try to turn it into glass?

2656
01:42:34.942 --> 01:42:37.515
TALIESIN: Can you turn it into glass?
SAM: I can try.

2657
01:42:37.515 --> 01:42:38.942
TALIESIN: I don't think it will.

2658
01:42:38.942 --> 01:42:40.914
MATT: Okay. What would you like to try?

2659
01:42:40.914 --> 01:42:44.309
SAM: I would like to think back on anything

2660
01:42:44.309 --> 01:42:47.576
that I might have seen or know about glass making

2661
01:42:47.576 --> 01:42:50.031
or melting or pouring into form.

2662
01:42:50.031 --> 01:42:53.051
MATT: Heat the crucible, sand granules being brought

2663
01:42:53.051 --> 01:42:55.140
to a certain point where they melt together.

2664
01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.091
LAURA: Oh, jeez.

2665
01:42:56.091 --> 01:43:00.100
TALIESIN: I mean, honestly, throwing this
into the pit may do it.

2666
01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:03.491
SAM: Yeah, well we need something to put it in, right?

2667
01:43:03.491 --> 01:43:05.204
Do they have some forms?

2668
01:43:05.204 --> 01:43:06.527
MATT: At this point, Khemdal goes like,

2669
01:43:06.527 --> 01:43:07.951
"I got something here that could help you."

2670
01:43:07.951 --> 01:43:09.725
Reaches up to one of the chains and pulls off

2671
01:43:09.725 --> 01:43:11.688
a long hand-held crucible

2672
01:43:11.688 --> 01:43:16.103
that's a thick steel bowl at the end of it.

2673
01:43:16.103 --> 01:43:18.892
LIAM: Well, the question, though, so your vision you had

2674
01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:22.438
is to put glass into the magma here.

2675
01:43:22.438 --> 01:43:23.595
TALIESIN: Sure.

2676
01:43:23.595 --> 01:43:25.690
LIAM: So the same thing, it would be dispersed,

2677
01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:27.710
it would be destroyed, the same thing will happen

2678
01:43:27.710 --> 01:43:29.629
to the dust, so I'm not sure we need to make it.

2679
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:31.378
LAURA: Yeah, but the dust is not refined.

2680
01:43:31.378 --> 01:43:34.884
What he's looking for is refined.

2681
01:43:34.884 --> 01:43:36.789
TALIESIN: Still, it's worth looking at it,

2682
01:43:36.789 --> 01:43:39.795
and these visions are not always necessarily--

2683
01:43:39.795 --> 01:43:41.795
TRAVIS: We'll see some impurities come to the surface.

2684
01:43:41.795 --> 01:43:45.578
TALIESIN: Are not always necessarily literal.

2685
01:43:46.981 --> 01:43:49.113
Sometimes it's just about feeling like

2686
01:43:49.113 --> 01:43:50.342
you're doing the right thing.

2687
01:43:50.342 --> 01:43:51.956
LAURA: Oh, so it's about faith.

2688
01:43:51.956 --> 01:43:53.276
TALIESIN: It's about faith.

2689
01:43:53.276 --> 01:43:56.609
SAM: You want refined glass, is that right?

2690
01:43:57.483 --> 01:43:58.516
All right.
TALIESIN: Don't know.

2691
01:43:58.516 --> 01:43:59.810
This may work, this may not.

2692
01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:02.710
MARISHA: Beyond faith, though, does it hurt

2693
01:44:02.710 --> 01:44:03.803
to take the extra steps?

2694
01:44:03.803 --> 01:44:04.868
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one.

2695
01:44:04.868 --> 01:44:06.252
MARISHA: Just to do it?

2696
01:44:06.252 --> 01:44:08.370
Because faith is great and all,

2697
01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:12.887
but also, you know, taking a few extra steps,

2698
01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:15.619
just for precaution.

2699
01:44:15.619 --> 01:44:17.352
LIAM: And if you have the time.

2700
01:44:17.352 --> 01:44:18.602
MARISHA: We have time.

2701
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:21.100
TALIESIN: What do you propose other than just

2702
01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:23.815
using the crucible there?

2703
01:44:23.815 --> 01:44:27.015
MARISHA: Well, no, I'm saying do that as opposed to

2704
01:44:27.015 --> 01:44:28.901
throwing the dust in the magma.

2705
01:44:28.901 --> 01:44:31.411
SAM: I don't remember-- I got a bag of this stuff,

2706
01:44:31.411 --> 01:44:33.017
I don't know how much that is.

2707
01:44:33.017 --> 01:44:35.955
I would want to try with maybe like a third

2708
01:44:35.955 --> 01:44:37.713
or a quarter of it.

2709
01:44:37.713 --> 01:44:40.548
TRAVIS: Come on.
TALIESIN: No, whole thing.

2710
01:44:40.548 --> 01:44:41.869
SAM: You want to do the whole thing?

2711
01:44:41.869 --> 01:44:44.158
MATT: The whole bag that you have is about that big.

2712
01:44:44.158 --> 01:44:45.489
TALIESIN: Oh, well let's just try

2713
01:44:45.489 --> 01:44:47.698
how much will fit in the crucible for now.

2714
01:44:47.698 --> 01:44:50.038
MATT: It accounts to-- if you want to mark this down,

2715
01:44:50.038 --> 01:44:51.711
if you're taking a look at it-- you're not--

2716
01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:53.078
make an intelligence check, actually.

2717
01:44:53.078 --> 01:44:54.470
LAURA: Oh.

2718
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:55.441
SAM: Natural 20.

2719
01:44:55.441 --> 01:44:58.171
MATT: Great.
(laughter)

2720
01:44:58.171 --> 01:44:59.004
Great.

2721
01:44:59.004 --> 01:44:59.953
TALIESIN: Just nonchalant.

2722
01:44:59.953 --> 01:45:02.545
MATT: You have 950 gold worth of residuum.

2723
01:45:02.545 --> 01:45:03.445
SAM: Okay.

2724
01:45:03.445 --> 01:45:05.912
MATT: Which means 950 gold worth of material components

2725
01:45:05.912 --> 01:45:07.839
from spells can be replaced with this residuum.

2726
01:45:07.839 --> 01:45:08.680
SAM: Okay.

2727
01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.845
LAURA: Oh, cool.

2728
01:45:09.845 --> 01:45:11.709
LIAM: Any components for any spell?

2729
01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:12.542
MATT: For any spell.

2730
01:45:12.542 --> 01:45:13.502
TALIESIN: Universal donor.

2731
01:45:13.502 --> 01:45:14.973
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

2732
01:45:14.973 --> 01:45:16.921
That's why residuum is a useful material.

2733
01:45:16.921 --> 01:45:18.654
TALIESIN: That's why Whitestone got money.

2734
01:45:18.654 --> 01:45:22.159
MATT: Well, Whitestone's refined stuff actually itself

2735
01:45:22.159 --> 01:45:24.957
can enhance and quicken the enchanting process,

2736
01:45:24.957 --> 01:45:26.848
which is why it's so sought after,

2737
01:45:26.848 --> 01:45:29.435
and it's a definitive secret of Whitestone.

2738
01:45:29.435 --> 01:45:30.421
LAURA: We need to go to Whitestone.

2739
01:45:30.421 --> 01:45:31.735
That stuff's magical.

2740
01:45:31.735 --> 01:45:33.945
TRAVIS: On the broken blade of the Star Razor,

2741
01:45:33.945 --> 01:45:36.328
the runes that are in the blade,

2742
01:45:36.328 --> 01:45:39.466
are they engraved in like a relief,

2743
01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:40.726
or are they etched in?

2744
01:45:40.726 --> 01:45:44.134
Like is there a space where something could fill that rune,

2745
01:45:44.134 --> 01:45:46.801
or is it more like a fine inlay?

2746
01:45:48.072 --> 01:45:52.672
MATT: From what you can-- it appears-- both, actually.

2747
01:45:52.672 --> 01:45:57.672
There are runes across the blade that are dwarven in design.

2748
01:45:57.868 --> 01:46:02.868
Those appear to have been placed post-original development.

2749
01:46:03.178 --> 01:46:05.343
The rest of it is an elvish based script,

2750
01:46:05.343 --> 01:46:07.094
there's more of a scrolling and a light etching.

2751
01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:07.927
TRAVIS: Got it.

2752
01:46:09.699 --> 01:46:10.999
TALIESIN: We need--

2753
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:16.281
we need advantages if
we're going to do this fight.

2754
01:46:16.281 --> 01:46:18.353
If we go back in where we are now,

2755
01:46:18.353 --> 01:46:21.028
the best thing that any of us can do

2756
01:46:21.028 --> 01:46:22.521
is get better right now.

2757
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:23.805
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2758
01:46:23.805 --> 01:46:26.370
SAM: So, just to clarify.

2759
01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:29.714
We can try to make this glass, but what will it get us?

2760
01:46:29.714 --> 01:46:30.714
What's the end?

2761
01:46:30.714 --> 01:46:32.127
You're going to throw it in a pool?

2762
01:46:32.127 --> 01:46:33.484
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw it in a pool.

2763
01:46:33.484 --> 01:46:36.963
SAM: Okay, so you want to use all of it or just some of it?

2764
01:46:36.963 --> 01:46:38.421
TRAVIS: A third is a healthy amount.

2765
01:46:38.421 --> 01:46:39.254
SAM: Okay.

2766
01:46:39.254 --> 01:46:41.138
LIAM: Why don't we look at it as an experiment?

2767
01:46:41.138 --> 01:46:43.523
SAM: Yeah, that's fine with me.

2768
01:46:43.523 --> 01:46:45.639
MATT: Take about 300 or so?
SAM: Yeah.

2769
01:46:45.639 --> 01:46:47.103
MATT: All right, about 300 gold worth,

2770
01:46:47.103 --> 01:46:50.636
which is a nice apple-sized amount of this residuum.

2771
01:46:50.636 --> 01:46:52.253
TALIESIN: A handful.
MATT: Yeah.

2772
01:46:52.253 --> 01:46:55.589
SAM: Then using my alchemist's tools--

2773
01:46:55.589 --> 01:46:56.854
MARISHA: Residuum fight.

2774
01:46:56.854 --> 01:46:58.003
(laughter)

2775
01:46:58.003 --> 01:47:02.748
SAM: Can I try to ascertain if it's mostly pure,

2776
01:47:02.748 --> 01:47:05.095
if it's corrupted with any other stuff?

2777
01:47:05.095 --> 01:47:07.546
He said we need it refined, so I'm just going to

2778
01:47:07.546 --> 01:47:10.590
see if I can, I don't know, sort it, sift it?

2779
01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:11.590
MATT: Just make an intelligence check.

2780
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:14.905
LIAM: (as Nott) It's a cup of angel dust.

2781
01:47:14.905 --> 01:47:17.034
SAM: This intelligence check is--

2782
01:47:17.034 --> 01:47:18.200
TALIESIN: Brought to you by the letter--

2783
01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.290
SAM: Is 14.

2784
01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:20.123
MATT: 14.

2785
01:47:20.123 --> 01:47:22.575
Looking through the samples of dust you have,

2786
01:47:22.575 --> 01:47:25.078
it all seems pretty uniform, you don't see it mingled

2787
01:47:25.078 --> 01:47:26.671
with any other outside materials.

2788
01:47:26.671 --> 01:47:28.017
It's pure.

2789
01:47:28.017 --> 01:47:29.532
SAM: Okay.

2790
01:47:29.532 --> 01:47:31.730
All right, let's just put it in the crucible.

2791
01:47:31.730 --> 01:47:33.438
MATT: All right, you place it in the crucible,

2792
01:47:33.438 --> 01:47:36.565
and with a little bit of guidance from Khemdal,

2793
01:47:36.565 --> 01:47:39.528
you lower it close, right near the surface,

2794
01:47:39.528 --> 01:47:41.247
where you can see the metal beginning to heat

2795
01:47:41.247 --> 01:47:44.913
brighter and brighter till it's a dull orange,

2796
01:47:44.913 --> 01:47:48.488
to a brighter orange,

2797
01:47:48.488 --> 01:47:52.308
to a slightly yellow tint to it.

2798
01:47:52.308 --> 01:47:54.633
You're having to like-- the layered, leather wrapping

2799
01:47:54.633 --> 01:47:56.752
of it, you can smell a little bit of the burn

2800
01:47:56.752 --> 01:47:58.525
from where the metal's starting to cause the handle

2801
01:47:58.525 --> 01:48:00.025
to slightly singe.

2802
01:48:00.977 --> 01:48:05.706
You've been holding it there for now six minutes,

2803
01:48:05.706 --> 01:48:07.210
seven minutes--

2804
01:48:07.210 --> 01:48:09.434
LAURA: How soon should you take it out?
SAM: I don't know.

2805
01:48:09.434 --> 01:48:11.301
Do I know?
MATT: Nobody knows.

2806
01:48:11.301 --> 01:48:13.850
LAURA: Would Nott know, though?
Have you made glass before?

2807
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:14.989
MATT: You've never worked with residuum.

2808
01:48:14.989 --> 01:48:16.391
Glass can happen pretty quickly,

2809
01:48:16.391 --> 01:48:18.271
especially at this temperature, so.

2810
01:48:18.271 --> 01:48:21.374
SAM: Okay, I don't think it can hurt
to just keep cooking it.

2811
01:48:21.374 --> 01:48:22.663
LAURA: Can't you burn it off?

2812
01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:23.864
TRAVIS: Can you see the inside?

2813
01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:26.760
SAM: Yeah, I'll cool it off and see if there's any change.

2814
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.409
MATT: Okay, you pull it up and look.

2815
01:48:28.409 --> 01:48:30.957
It is as granular as it was when you placed it in there.

2816
01:48:30.957 --> 01:48:31.790
SAM: Whoa.

2817
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:33.930
MATT: It is unaffected by the heat.

2818
01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:36.456
TALIESIN: How hot is it, though?

2819
01:48:36.456 --> 01:48:38.317
MATT: The temperature of the residuum?

2820
01:48:38.317 --> 01:48:39.150
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2821
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:40.584
MATT: You go ahead and place your fingers

2822
01:48:40.584 --> 01:48:41.929
onto the residuum dust?

2823
01:48:41.929 --> 01:48:43.925
TALIESIN: No, I'm--
SAM: Over it.

2824
01:48:43.925 --> 01:48:44.758
MATT: Over it?

2825
01:48:44.758 --> 01:48:47.006
I mean, the metal is emanating a lot of heat.

2826
01:48:47.006 --> 01:48:48.305
LAURA: Ooh, don't burn yourself there.

2827
01:48:48.305 --> 01:48:50.413
MATT: Super hot.

2828
01:48:50.413 --> 01:48:54.817
SAM: Do I recall any sort of chemicals that would

2829
01:48:54.817 --> 01:48:58.433
help a process of this,

2830
01:48:58.433 --> 01:48:59.883
of making glass?

2831
01:48:59.883 --> 01:49:01.756
MATT: There are many different chemicals you could try,

2832
01:49:01.756 --> 01:49:03.882
if you want to make an intelligence check

2833
01:49:03.882 --> 01:49:06.773
plus your alchemy proficiency bonus.

2834
01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:08.322
SAM: Alchemy proficiency.

2835
01:49:08.322 --> 01:49:09.342
What's that mean?

2836
01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:12.382
MATT: Just adding a benefit for your experience--

2837
01:49:12.382 --> 01:49:13.529
SAM: No, but I mean, where--

2838
01:49:13.529 --> 01:49:14.395
MATT: You just add your proficiency bonus.

2839
01:49:14.395 --> 01:49:15.478
SAM: Okay, cool.

2840
01:49:16.686 --> 01:49:18.574
Proficiency, we're at six now, right?

2841
01:49:18.574 --> 01:49:19.415
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2842
01:49:19.415 --> 01:49:20.700
SAM: So four?
TALIESIN: Four.

2843
01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.131
SAM: Oh, 15 then.

2844
01:49:22.131 --> 01:49:22.964
MATT: 15.

2845
01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:26.096
I mean, there's different chemicals that can have--

2846
01:49:26.096 --> 01:49:28.248
SAM: Like a catalyst, some sort of catalyst?

2847
01:49:28.248 --> 01:49:30.310
MATT: Yeah, catalysts for different reactions.

2848
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:35.310
There are, you know, sulfurs or--

2849
01:49:35.703 --> 01:49:38.870
TRAVIS: Maybe things we have vials of.

2850
01:49:40.132 --> 01:49:45.132
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to the bag.

2851
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:46.363
SAM: Uh-huh.

2852
01:49:47.697 --> 01:49:49.770
TALIESIN: I'm going to put my hand in it,
if that's all right.

2853
01:49:49.770 --> 01:49:50.748
SAM: Sure.

2854
01:49:50.748 --> 01:49:52.308
TALIESIN: Just take a scoop of it out.

2855
01:49:52.308 --> 01:49:53.476
SAM: Are you going to snort it?

2856
01:49:53.476 --> 01:49:54.612
TALIESIN: No.

2857
01:49:54.612 --> 01:49:56.065
I'm going to walk over to the fire.

2858
01:49:56.065 --> 01:49:56.898
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2859
01:49:56.898 --> 01:49:59.119
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my hand--

2860
01:49:59.119 --> 01:50:01.419
SAM: Oh god.
TALIESIN: Close as it can get

2861
01:50:01.419 --> 01:50:03.181
to over the fire before it singes.

2862
01:50:03.181 --> 01:50:04.382
MATT: It's very hot.

2863
01:50:04.382 --> 01:50:06.928
Your hairs on your arm begin to curl back.

2864
01:50:06.928 --> 01:50:08.144
TALIESIN: I'll loose a bit.

2865
01:50:08.144 --> 01:50:09.427
And I'm going to scatter it in.

2866
01:50:09.427 --> 01:50:10.260
MATT: Okay.

2867
01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:12.246
It all drifts, and you can see the dark spots

2868
01:50:12.246 --> 01:50:15.226
where now it's-- with that handful, it's about 150

2869
01:50:15.226 --> 01:50:17.714
of that residuum that is taken off.

2870
01:50:17.714 --> 01:50:18.612
SAM: Sure.

2871
01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:23.046
MATT: You watch it know hit it and just rest there

2872
01:50:23.046 --> 01:50:25.963
before eventually it just vanishes

2873
01:50:25.963 --> 01:50:29.105
into the molten rock.

2874
01:50:29.105 --> 01:50:30.068
TALIESIN: All right.

2875
01:50:30.068 --> 01:50:31.723
Now we know.

2876
01:50:31.723 --> 01:50:33.447
SAM: Now we know.

2877
01:50:33.447 --> 01:50:36.445
TALIESIN: That's the trick with faith.

2878
01:50:36.445 --> 01:50:38.776
MARISHA: Is that it's always an experiment?

2879
01:50:38.776 --> 01:50:40.954
TALIESIN: Is that if you're not willing
to move forward in it

2880
01:50:40.954 --> 01:50:44.494
until you know, then you don't need it, do you?

2881
01:50:44.494 --> 01:50:46.385
If you know--

2882
01:50:46.385 --> 01:50:48.504
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: -- it's not faith.

2883
01:50:48.504 --> 01:50:52.227
SAM: In my memory, I thought of no particular catalyst

2884
01:50:52.227 --> 01:50:56.296
that might make this lower melting points

2885
01:50:56.296 --> 01:50:58.017
of different sort of--

2886
01:50:58.017 --> 01:50:59.678
MATT: There are many catalysts here.

2887
01:50:59.678 --> 01:51:01.490
For the sake of me not going here

2888
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:04.544
and spewing a bunch of incorrect chemical information

2889
01:51:04.544 --> 01:51:06.212
for all of our chemists who are watching the show

2890
01:51:06.212 --> 01:51:09.224
who would just destroy me on Twitter,

2891
01:51:09.224 --> 01:51:11.074
there are a handful that you think of.

2892
01:51:11.074 --> 01:51:14.272
SAM: Might I have anything in my possession
that I could try?

2893
01:51:14.272 --> 01:51:17.762
MATT: Sure, I'll say go ahead and make another

2894
01:51:17.762 --> 01:51:20.228
alchemist proficiency, if you want to try and pull out

2895
01:51:20.228 --> 01:51:21.804
and refine some of this.
SAM: Okay.

2896
01:51:21.804 --> 01:51:23.126
MATT: It takes a little bit for it to cool off.

2897
01:51:23.126 --> 01:51:26.885
This stone, the residuum dust, is super hot in the crucible.

2898
01:51:26.885 --> 01:51:29.891
So it's conducting the heat, it's just not changing.

2899
01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:31.529
SAM: I've rolled a 14.

2900
01:51:31.529 --> 01:51:32.560
MATT: A 14?

2901
01:51:33.931 --> 01:51:35.951
You pull through, and you pull out some acids,

2902
01:51:35.951 --> 01:51:39.790
you pull out some thicker tar-based materials,

2903
01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:42.985
you think of some viscous oils that might have

2904
01:51:42.985 --> 01:51:46.364
some sort of a transitive property to it.

2905
01:51:46.364 --> 01:51:48.499
Nothing seems to be adjusting its format.

2906
01:51:48.499 --> 01:51:53.499
TALIESIN: I'm going to start casting Commune
as I sit by the kiln.

2907
01:51:53.593 --> 01:51:55.160
MATT: Okay.

2908
01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.800
SAM: I knew I shouldn't have left Yeza.

2909
01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.692
We need him now, here.

2910
01:51:58.692 --> 01:52:00.967
Quick, teleport me back to Nicodranas.

2911
01:52:00.967 --> 01:52:03.398
TRAVIS: Oh god, no, Nott, no, don't overreact.

2912
01:52:03.398 --> 01:52:04.355
Don't overreact.

2913
01:52:04.355 --> 01:52:06.198
SAM: You could send a message to him.
MARISHA: We could phone a friend.

2914
01:52:06.198 --> 01:52:07.771
LAURA: What should I say to Yeza?
Like, okay, what--

2915
01:52:07.771 --> 01:52:09.321
SAM: Refining glass.

2916
01:52:09.321 --> 01:52:11.852
What catalyst should use?

2917
01:52:11.852 --> 01:52:13.266
Maybe you can say "should we use."

2918
01:52:13.266 --> 01:52:16.044
TRAVIS: Or maybe mention residuum.
MARISHA: It's not glass.

2919
01:52:16.044 --> 01:52:18.458
LAURA: It's green glass.
TRAVIS: It's green residuum.

2920
01:52:18.458 --> 01:52:21.168
LAURA: Residuum, how do we turn residuum into glass?

2921
01:52:21.168 --> 01:52:23.243
SAM: He might not know what residuum is.

2922
01:52:23.243 --> 01:52:25.204
LAURA: Everybody knows what residuum is.

2923
01:52:25.204 --> 01:52:27.538
Especially alchemists.
LIAM: Is that true?

2924
01:52:27.538 --> 01:52:30.136
MATT: To your knowledge, no.

2925
01:52:30.136 --> 01:52:33.990
It's actually pretty narrow knowledge,

2926
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:37.123
largely in arcane fields, and magic practitioners

2927
01:52:37.123 --> 01:52:40.554
that know of it, and even then, it's a pretty rare material.

2928
01:52:40.554 --> 01:52:42.737
SAM: You can try.
LIAM: But Yeza might.

2929
01:52:42.737 --> 01:52:45.120
TALIESIN: I have just taken some incense

2930
01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:47.254
and just scattered it in front of it,

2931
01:52:47.254 --> 01:52:49.513
right at the base of the kiln so that I can

2932
01:52:49.513 --> 01:52:51.577
breathe it in from the kiln as I sit

2933
01:52:51.577 --> 01:52:53.802
and wait for the trance to hit.

2934
01:52:53.802 --> 01:52:54.802
MATT: Okay.

2935
01:52:54.802 --> 01:52:56.151
LIAM: It fuses with your sinuses.

2936
01:52:56.151 --> 01:52:58.353
MATT: As the smoke from the various bits of incense

2937
01:52:58.353 --> 01:53:00.372
burn up and fill the space

2938
01:53:00.372 --> 01:53:05.097
with a heavy lavender smell that mingles

2939
01:53:05.097 --> 01:53:07.381
with the rest of the smoky interior,

2940
01:53:07.381 --> 01:53:11.712
and sweat-like scent that fills the air.

2941
01:53:11.712 --> 01:53:15.493
You watch the smoke swirl around Caduceus

2942
01:53:15.493 --> 01:53:18.199
in an unnatural way before dissipating.

2943
01:53:18.199 --> 01:53:22.361
In a weird way, a bit of a warmth

2944
01:53:22.361 --> 01:53:26.707
hits your clavicle and chest momentarily, Fjord,

2945
01:53:26.707 --> 01:53:29.624
as you watch Caduceus's eyes close.

2946
01:53:32.121 --> 01:53:36.042
The heat rolls away, and much like

2947
01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:39.624
the early morning light of a dawning sun,

2948
01:53:39.624 --> 01:53:42.325
you feel the warmth surround you,

2949
01:53:42.325 --> 01:53:46.799
and the wrapping and safe presence

2950
01:53:46.799 --> 01:53:50.391
of the mother that's guided you.

2951
01:53:54.728 --> 01:53:59.728
TALIESIN: I'm supposed to be searching
for the refined residuum for this kiln.

2952
01:54:03.146 --> 01:54:03.979
MATT: That's your first question?

2953
01:54:03.979 --> 01:54:05.289
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2954
01:54:05.289 --> 01:54:06.122
Yes or no.

2955
01:54:07.104 --> 01:54:12.104
MATT: You sense that the visions that were once given to you

2956
01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:15.807
come back clearer a second time,

2957
01:54:15.807 --> 01:54:20.807
and you see these larger shards of condensed,

2958
01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:26.955
jagged but still smooth and polished in places,
residuum glass.

2959
01:54:27.183 --> 01:54:29.027
You gather the answer is clarifying it

2960
01:54:29.027 --> 01:54:30.944
to be a definitive yes.

2961
01:54:33.045 --> 01:54:36.928
TALIESIN: Is Whitestone the most accessible--

2962
01:54:41.936 --> 01:54:46.927
is that the closest

2963
01:54:47.928 --> 01:54:51.289
place to find such material?

2964
01:54:51.289 --> 01:54:54.698
MATT: You see visions of alabaster mountains

2965
01:54:54.698 --> 01:54:58.329
surrounding a valley filled with a dark forest.

2966
01:54:58.329 --> 01:55:03.321
You see elements of green glass being gathered into crates.

2967
01:55:04.248 --> 01:55:06.642
You see them being placed onto the back of carts

2968
01:55:06.642 --> 01:55:10.496
and onto ships, sailing off across the sea.

2969
01:55:10.496 --> 01:55:13.746
And you get the sense the answer is no.

2970
01:55:22.494 --> 01:55:27.477
TALIESIN: Will I find the man who can reforge this sword

2971
01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:32.425
in the city that he is from?

2972
01:55:33.938 --> 01:55:36.102
Ulda-- I can't pronounce it, because--

2973
01:55:36.102 --> 01:55:36.935
LAURA: Uthodurn.

2974
01:55:36.935 --> 01:55:38.550
TALIESIN: Uthodurn, thank you.
SAM: Laura Dern.

2975
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:40.573
MATT: The man who can reforge this sword

2976
01:55:40.573 --> 01:55:42.063
in the city where he's from.

2977
01:55:42.063 --> 01:55:44.426
TALIESIN: Can I find him in that city?

2978
01:55:44.426 --> 01:55:45.977
Uthodurn.

2979
01:55:45.977 --> 01:55:49.714
MATT: You sense the warm breath of the mother

2980
01:55:49.714 --> 01:55:51.470
across your back as the arms

2981
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:54.192
encircle you and embrace, a comfortable mother

2982
01:55:54.192 --> 01:55:56.906
holding a child from behind.

2983
01:55:56.906 --> 01:56:01.025
You feel the nod of her cheek against yours,

2984
01:56:01.025 --> 01:56:03.775
affirming your question as a yes.

2985
01:56:05.117 --> 01:56:07.784
As her grip pulls away from you,

2986
01:56:08.846 --> 01:56:12.072
the love that's encircled you doesn't entirely leave,

2987
01:56:12.072 --> 01:56:16.598
but withdraws, and once more the scent of smoke and soot

2988
01:56:16.598 --> 01:56:21.278
fills your senses, and your eyes open, slightly watering,

2989
01:56:21.278 --> 01:56:26.023
sitting amongst the Underforge, your friends staring at you.

2990
01:56:26.023 --> 01:56:31.023
TALIESIN: We need to find the refined residuum.

2991
01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:32.688
LAURA: Well, what if we can make it here?

2992
01:56:32.688 --> 01:56:34.572
TALIESIN: We can't make it here.

2993
01:56:34.572 --> 01:56:37.660
I don't think it can be made, I think it can only be found.

2994
01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:40.992
SAM: Do you think we could go to Laura Dern and find it?

2995
01:56:40.992 --> 01:56:42.337
TALIESIN: Maybe.

2996
01:56:42.337 --> 01:56:44.443
I don't know.

2997
01:56:44.443 --> 01:56:47.126
I think that that's going to be

2998
01:56:48.934 --> 01:56:50.617
part of what we do next,

2999
01:56:50.617 --> 01:56:52.117
but I do know

3000
01:56:53.567 --> 01:56:57.183
that if you're willing tomorrow,

3001
01:56:57.183 --> 01:57:00.016
we can go get your sword reforged.

3002
01:57:01.032 --> 01:57:04.657
LIAM: Is that all you need to do here before we leave?

3003
01:57:04.657 --> 01:57:07.518
TALIESIN: I need to talk, and I would
appreciate spending the night,

3004
01:57:07.518 --> 01:57:10.357
but I get the distinct impression that

3005
01:57:10.357 --> 01:57:12.869
I'm going to be back very quickly.

3006
01:57:12.869 --> 01:57:14.498
LAURA: Wait, I have a question, though.

3007
01:57:14.498 --> 01:57:15.461
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3008
01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:19.626
LAURA: Dulgrim, the guy that forged the sword, right?

3009
01:57:19.626 --> 01:57:21.341
Khemdal?

3010
01:57:21.341 --> 01:57:26.336
You said that Dulgrim comes here to work sometimes?

3011
01:57:26.336 --> 01:57:27.514
SAM: But hasn't in a while.

3012
01:57:27.514 --> 01:57:30.847
MATT: "Dulgrim has occasionally come through.

3013
01:57:32.468 --> 01:57:34.469
"When I was very young."

3014
01:57:34.469 --> 01:57:37.444
LAURA: Is this anvil like, stronger or better

3015
01:57:37.444 --> 01:57:40.282
than something that he would have at Uthodurn?

3016
01:57:40.282 --> 01:57:41.491
MATT: "Probably.

3017
01:57:41.491 --> 01:57:44.169
"This is a place where many great crafts have been made,"

3018
01:57:44.169 --> 01:57:48.198
and you watch as Tyla turns and points towards the walls,

3019
01:57:48.198 --> 01:57:53.198
and you see those metal bars and

3020
01:57:53.262 --> 01:57:56.103
braces that curl up along the walls.

3021
01:57:56.103 --> 01:57:58.763
At a glance you can see, there's a bunch of script

3022
01:57:58.763 --> 01:58:01.036
scrolled across them.

3023
01:58:01.036 --> 01:58:02.928
Dwarvish runes.

3024
01:58:02.928 --> 01:58:06.034
"These all tell tales of all the fine crafts

3025
01:58:06.034 --> 01:58:07.607
"that have been made here."

3026
01:58:07.607 --> 01:58:09.343
MARISHA: Oh.
LAURA: Wow.

3027
01:58:09.343 --> 01:58:11.522
MARISHA: They keep a ledger.

3028
01:58:11.522 --> 01:58:15.005
LAURA: Do we see anything about the sword?

3029
01:58:15.005 --> 01:58:17.155
MARISHA: Yeah, anyone, who reads--?

3030
01:58:17.155 --> 01:58:19.030
(gasps) I read Dwarvish!

3031
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:21.398
(laughter)

3032
01:58:21.398 --> 01:58:23.023
TRAVIS: You do.

3033
01:58:23.023 --> 01:58:23.976
Hey!

3034
01:58:23.976 --> 01:58:25.076
You do!

3035
01:58:25.076 --> 01:58:26.657
MARISHA: Ah!

3036
01:58:26.657 --> 01:58:28.361
Languages are a big part of the Cobalt Soul,

3037
01:58:28.361 --> 01:58:31.152
and I picked none that were useful thus far, sorry.

3038
01:58:31.152 --> 01:58:32.561
MATT: Well, there you go.

3039
01:58:32.561 --> 01:58:34.024
TRAVIS: Those are some pretty good selections, though.

3040
01:58:34.024 --> 01:58:36.103
TALIESIN: You're that kid who took Latin.

3041
01:58:36.103 --> 01:58:38.098
MARISHA: I thought Deep Speech
was going to be relevant--

3042
01:58:38.098 --> 01:58:40.000
LAURA: Can you find it, can you find the sword?

3043
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.839
MARISHA: I look for the Star Razor.

3044
01:58:42.839 --> 01:58:43.993
TALIESIN: Heck, read 'em all.

3045
01:58:43.993 --> 01:58:45.440
TRAVIS: Just read the whole fucking thing.

3046
01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:46.831
MARISHA: I read them all!

3047
01:58:46.831 --> 01:58:48.829
MATT: I mean, you go through and scan through them,

3048
01:58:48.829 --> 01:58:50.684
and it's talking about many weapons

3049
01:58:50.684 --> 01:58:53.407
that have been made for ceremonial reasons

3050
01:58:53.407 --> 01:58:56.560
for different families, from all across Exandria

3051
01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:01.153
that have made pilgrimages here to have things made

3052
01:59:01.153 --> 01:59:04.378
by their finest craftsmen and smithies.

3053
01:59:04.378 --> 01:59:06.172
Some of them speak of, you know,

3054
01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:09.554
things that were recovered from the Calamity and before

3055
01:59:09.554 --> 01:59:11.733
that have been fixed and repaired.

3056
01:59:11.733 --> 01:59:16.733
Elements of ceremonial armor and

3057
01:59:16.758 --> 01:59:18.299
religious icons

3058
01:59:18.299 --> 01:59:20.676
that have been-- then, after being crafted

3059
01:59:20.676 --> 01:59:23.593
in the name and spirit of the various deities

3060
01:59:23.593 --> 01:59:26.777
that are held here, which are

3061
01:59:26.777 --> 01:59:30.862
adjacent between Melora and the Allhammer together,

3062
01:59:30.862 --> 01:59:34.163
Moradin, you know, Raven Queen,

3063
01:59:34.163 --> 01:59:37.361
talk of Erathis and other entities

3064
01:59:37.361 --> 01:59:39.805
that are adjacent to those figures as well,

3065
01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:42.408
having various artifacts made, repaired,

3066
01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:44.861
or initially constructed here.

3067
01:59:44.861 --> 01:59:48.077
The Underforge is also spoken of

3068
01:59:48.077 --> 01:59:52.535
as a lesser sister creation

3069
01:59:52.535 --> 01:59:57.377
of another object referred to
as the Core Anvil that was lost

3070
01:59:57.377 --> 02:00:00.232
deep beneath the Ozmit Sea long ago.

3071
02:00:00.232 --> 02:00:02.261
SAM: That sounds very familiar.
TALIESIN: No, it doesn't,

3072
02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:03.291
never heard of it before.
TRAVIS: Almost like a dream

3073
02:00:03.291 --> 02:00:05.671
from another time.

3074
02:00:05.671 --> 02:00:06.715
TALIESIN: Previously.

3075
02:00:06.715 --> 02:00:08.873
MARISHA: The Core Anvil?
MATT: Core Anvil.

3076
02:00:08.873 --> 02:00:10.697
MARISHA: Oh jeez, more shit?

3077
02:00:10.697 --> 02:00:12.780
TRAVIS: (whispering) It's where we made the shards

3078
02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:13.955
for killing Vecna.

3079
02:00:13.955 --> 02:00:16.485
SAM: Oh yes, that's right.

3080
02:00:16.485 --> 02:00:17.766
MARISHA: Oh!

3081
02:00:17.766 --> 02:00:20.762
TRAVIS: That dream from another time.

3082
02:00:20.762 --> 02:00:23.036
MARISHA: So much throwback today.

3083
02:00:23.036 --> 02:00:25.123
TALIESIN: This is some intense throwback.

3084
02:00:25.123 --> 02:00:26.448
TRAVIS: This is really good stuff.

3085
02:00:26.448 --> 02:00:30.168
TALIESIN: I'm having a very hard time separating my desires

3086
02:00:30.168 --> 02:00:32.795
from my character's right now, which is very--

3087
02:00:32.795 --> 02:00:34.822
just a lot of candy on the table.

3088
02:00:34.822 --> 02:00:38.422
MARISHA: Wait, is that it, nothing of the
Star Razor or Dwueth'var?

3089
02:00:38.422 --> 02:00:39.736
MATT: If you want to spend a while tonight,

3090
02:00:39.736 --> 02:00:41.241
it's a lot of reading to do, but you do eventually

3091
02:00:41.241 --> 02:00:42.878
come onto the Star Razor.

3092
02:00:42.878 --> 02:00:44.129
MARISHA: Yes.

3093
02:00:44.129 --> 02:00:48.716
MATT: It speaks of-- and you see the name Dulgrim Smeltborne

3094
02:00:48.716 --> 02:00:52.175
come up a number of times, over the period of

3095
02:00:52.175 --> 02:00:56.481
a number of centuries, as essentially the

3096
02:00:56.481 --> 02:01:00.045
Hattori Hanzo of this realm.

3097
02:01:00.045 --> 02:01:03.120
A fabled weapon smith,

3098
02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:06.586
who had been called to create

3099
02:01:06.586 --> 02:01:09.677
implements of war by

3100
02:01:10.886 --> 02:01:13.544
the elves of Molaesmyr.

3101
02:01:13.544 --> 02:01:15.373
If you want to roll a history check.

3102
02:01:15.373 --> 02:01:19.066
MARISHA: I do want to roll a history check.

3103
02:01:19.066 --> 02:01:19.899
LIAM: Cocked.

3104
02:01:19.899 --> 02:01:20.732
TALIESIN: Cocked.

3105
02:01:20.732 --> 02:01:22.240
MATT: How is that cocked?
LIAM: It's cocked.

3106
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:24.739
MATT: That's impressive. Roll again.
LIAM: Leaning on a d4.

3107
02:01:24.739 --> 02:01:27.052
MATT: No, I mean like, it is cocked, but it--
oh, it's leaning, that's why.

3108
02:01:27.052 --> 02:01:28.076
TALIESIN: That one's really pretty, too.

3109
02:01:28.076 --> 02:01:29.217
MARISHA: It's close to the same thing.

3110
02:01:29.217 --> 02:01:30.708
What'd you say, history?

3111
02:01:30.708 --> 02:01:34.228
MATT: It was strange to see it cocked in that way.

3112
02:01:34.228 --> 02:01:35.061
MARISHA: 20 total.

3113
02:01:35.061 --> 02:01:36.284
MATT: 20 total, okay.

3114
02:01:36.284 --> 02:01:39.984
Molaesmyr you do recall as one of the

3115
02:01:39.984 --> 02:01:42.221
previous powerful elven nations.

3116
02:01:42.221 --> 02:01:46.002
At one point early in this age,

3117
02:01:46.002 --> 02:01:51.002
<i>the</i> prominent elven society here on Wildemount.

3118
02:01:51.146 --> 02:01:54.016
However, through some strange,

3119
02:01:54.016 --> 02:01:56.786
not entirely understood cataclysm,

3120
02:01:56.786 --> 02:02:00.457
the city fell and the surrounding forest was corrupted,

3121
02:02:00.457 --> 02:02:02.386
which is now known as the Savalirwood.

3122
02:02:02.386 --> 02:02:03.993
TRAVIS: Hmm.
LAURA: Oh.

3123
02:02:03.993 --> 02:02:06.415
The elves scattered in two directions.

3124
02:02:06.415 --> 02:02:09.265
Some of them fled westward and then became the elves

3125
02:02:09.265 --> 02:02:12.284
that eventually were taken into the Empire in Bysaes Tyl,

3126
02:02:12.284 --> 02:02:14.809
and throughout the rest of

3127
02:02:14.809 --> 02:02:18.100
western Wynandir and Wildemount.

3128
02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:23.100
The others went northward and founded Uthodurn.

3129
02:02:23.176 --> 02:02:25.021
Or didn't found Uthodurn, sorry.

3130
02:02:25.021 --> 02:02:26.763
Joined Uthodurn, which had previously

3131
02:02:26.763 --> 02:02:28.584
been founded by the dwarves.

3132
02:02:28.584 --> 02:02:32.009
MARISHA: Half went to Uthodurn,
half went to the Savalirwood.

3133
02:02:32.009 --> 02:02:32.893
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Okay.

3134
02:02:32.893 --> 02:02:34.848
MATT: Or fled there and went to the Empire.

3135
02:02:34.848 --> 02:02:36.944
TRAVIS: The Savalirwood is where it was.

3136
02:02:36.944 --> 02:02:38.899
MARISHA: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

3137
02:02:38.899 --> 02:02:39.998
TRAVIS: Molaesmyr.

3138
02:02:39.998 --> 02:02:42.689
MATT: Looking here, you can see in the center

3139
02:02:42.689 --> 02:02:43.884
of the Savalirwood map you have,

3140
02:02:43.884 --> 02:02:46.827
the ruins of Molaesmyr are marked there as well.

3141
02:02:48.418 --> 02:02:49.366
TRAVIS: Yep.

3142
02:02:49.366 --> 02:02:52.412
LAURA: Should I send a message to Dulgrim
and see if he's around?

3143
02:02:52.412 --> 02:02:54.201
SAM: How can you do that?

3144
02:02:54.201 --> 02:02:57.267
Do you need to know what he looks like?

3145
02:02:57.267 --> 02:02:58.321
LAURA: Oh, do I?

3146
02:02:58.321 --> 02:02:59.431
SAM: I don't know, do you?

3147
02:02:59.431 --> 02:03:02.765
LAURA: I think if I just know his name, could be wrong.

3148
02:03:02.765 --> 02:03:03.907
SAM: Sending.

3149
02:03:03.907 --> 02:03:04.740
LIAM: What is there's two?

3150
02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:06.115
LAURA: I'm going to look!

3151
02:03:06.115 --> 02:03:11.115
TALIESIN: Or we can just have a good old-fashioned quest.

3152
02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:13.584
LAURA: A creature with which you are familiar.

3153
02:03:13.584 --> 02:03:16.917
Am I familiar with him, I know his name?

3154
02:03:19.016 --> 02:03:22.730
MATT: You know the name, that is a level of familiarity,

3155
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:24.366
you can certainly try.

3156
02:03:24.366 --> 02:03:27.647
LAURA: I could ask the Dusts what he looks like,

3157
02:03:27.647 --> 02:03:29.796
what his personality's like.

3158
02:03:29.796 --> 02:03:32.414
MATT: Yeah, you can go ahead and ask Jeramess,
who's the oldest,

3159
02:03:32.414 --> 02:03:35.000
the one who seems to interacted with him most.

3160
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
"Right, right, yeah, he's a squat lad,

3161
02:03:40.952 --> 02:03:44.495
"broad shoulders, got black hair,

3162
02:03:44.495 --> 02:03:48.133
"thinning in the front but strong and heavy, thick mat

3163
02:03:48.133 --> 02:03:51.968
"in the back, bulbous nose, looks like it's taken

3164
02:03:51.968 --> 02:03:56.963
"a few hits in his youth, piercing bright light blue eyes,

3165
02:03:56.963 --> 02:03:59.945
"almost like a gray-white in color."

3166
02:03:59.945 --> 02:04:00.888
LAURA: Wow.

3167
02:04:00.888 --> 02:04:02.344
SAM: Dwarf, elf?

3168
02:04:02.344 --> 02:04:04.444
MATT: "Dwarf, dwarf."

3169
02:04:04.444 --> 02:04:07.092
Goes into this full description

3170
02:04:07.092 --> 02:04:09.752
of the different stages in which they had met

3171
02:04:09.752 --> 02:04:12.580
in the times that he had visited to do the forging here.

3172
02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.452
LAURA: How old would must he be now?

3173
02:04:14.452 --> 02:04:17.903
MATT: "Last time we saw him he was very old, very old.

3174
02:04:17.903 --> 02:04:20.927
"I think nearing fourth century, if not partially--"

3175
02:04:20.927 --> 02:04:22.868
LAURA: How old do dwarves usually--

3176
02:04:22.868 --> 02:04:26.023
MATT: That's like super old for a dwarf.

3177
02:04:26.023 --> 02:04:28.783
LAURA: It's going to be hard for him to get here, then.

3178
02:04:28.783 --> 02:04:29.616
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3179
02:04:29.616 --> 02:04:30.644
SAM: It's a day and a half journey.

3180
02:04:30.644 --> 02:04:34.168
LIAM: Well, may I ask, is it possible that you have

3181
02:04:34.168 --> 02:04:38.666
a teleportation circle here on the premises?

3182
02:04:38.666 --> 02:04:40.417
MATT: They all look at each other.

3183
02:04:40.417 --> 02:04:41.495
"No."

3184
02:04:41.495 --> 02:04:43.809
LIAM: No, well, that's that.

3185
02:04:43.809 --> 02:04:45.794
SAM: But you can still send him a message.

3186
02:04:45.794 --> 02:04:46.650
LAURA: I'll still send a message.

3187
02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:48.868
SAM: Maybe you can tell by his voice when he picks up

3188
02:04:48.868 --> 02:04:52.513
how feeble he is, you know?

3189
02:04:52.513 --> 02:04:55.060
TALIESIN: I mean, we're going to head to the city anyway.

3190
02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.003
LAURA: I was going to say, if he's able, then he could

3191
02:04:57.003 --> 02:04:59.641
just come here, but you know, if he's like--

3192
02:04:59.641 --> 02:05:03.036
TRAVIS: Plus a heads up is good, it'll save us some time.

3193
02:05:03.036 --> 02:05:06.105
TALIESIN: I think showing proper respect, though,

3194
02:05:06.105 --> 02:05:07.588
I think just going to the place

3195
02:05:07.588 --> 02:05:11.351
and showing our sincerity and our sincere desire

3196
02:05:11.351 --> 02:05:12.735
to have this done.

3197
02:05:12.735 --> 02:05:15.535
We're not just trying to speed things along.

3198
02:05:15.535 --> 02:05:16.671
SAM: -- we're on our way.

3199
02:05:16.671 --> 02:05:18.107
LIAM: I actually agree with Caduceus,

3200
02:05:18.107 --> 02:05:19.864
I don't think you want to pop into a stranger's head

3201
02:05:19.864 --> 02:05:22.176
and say "Hey, here we are, here we come."

3202
02:05:22.176 --> 02:05:23.408
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3203
02:05:23.408 --> 02:05:25.322
LAURA: Oh, is it rude or something?

3204
02:05:25.322 --> 02:05:27.326
TRAVIS: Might be a bit, yeah.
LIAM: A little bit, yeah.

3205
02:05:27.326 --> 02:05:29.026
LAURA: Really?
TALIESIN: He could be eating dinner.

3206
02:05:29.026 --> 02:05:30.102
LIAM: I think so.

3207
02:05:31.297 --> 02:05:33.135
LAURA: Do you think that people don't like it

3208
02:05:33.135 --> 02:05:34.306
when I send them messages?

3209
02:05:34.306 --> 02:05:35.640
TALIESIN: I think people like it when they can

3210
02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.715
already picture your beautiful face.

3211
02:05:37.715 --> 02:05:39.922
LIAM: Yeah, when they know you, of course,

3212
02:05:39.922 --> 02:05:40.977
it's a different thing.

3213
02:05:40.977 --> 02:05:43.995
But a stranger popping into your consciousness is--

3214
02:05:43.995 --> 02:05:45.020
TALIESIN: Jarring.
LIAM: Strange.

3215
02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:46.588
LAURA: A bit invasive?
LIAM: Yeah.

3216
02:05:46.588 --> 02:05:48.854
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

3217
02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:53.491
TALIESIN: Would it be all right if we stayed the night?

3218
02:05:53.491 --> 02:05:55.523
MATT: "Oh yeah, of course, of course.

3219
02:05:55.523 --> 02:05:58.822
"You can have my other son's room for the night.

3220
02:05:58.822 --> 02:06:01.289
"It's probably not the best, but it'll work.

3221
02:06:01.289 --> 02:06:04.290
"At the very least, we'll get you some blankets, and--

3222
02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:07.530
"though you may not need them, it's not very cold in here."

3223
02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:10.244
TALIESIN: I'd love to see as much of this place as possible,

3224
02:06:10.244 --> 02:06:13.247
and to take a look at anything that might've been

3225
02:06:13.247 --> 02:06:14.791
written down about my family.

3226
02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:16.864
MATT: "Tyla'll show you around, no worries."

3227
02:06:16.864 --> 02:06:20.399
TRAVIS: You don't have like an armory or weapons or--

3228
02:06:20.399 --> 02:06:22.385
LIAM: Or library?

3229
02:06:22.385 --> 02:06:27.385
MATT: She looks at Tyla, Tyla goes, "No, no library."

3230
02:06:27.943 --> 02:06:30.175
MARISHA: I think she is the library.

3231
02:06:30.175 --> 02:06:31.974
LIAM: One of them had a book a second ago.

3232
02:06:31.974 --> 02:06:33.597
MATT: She still has the book and she tucks it

3233
02:06:33.597 --> 02:06:35.179
into her robes a bit.

3234
02:06:35.179 --> 02:06:37.784
(laughter)

3235
02:06:37.784 --> 02:06:40.016
MARISHA: Is she deceiving us?

3236
02:06:40.016 --> 02:06:41.172
Is there a library?

3237
02:06:41.172 --> 02:06:43.730
MATT: No, not like there's no book, trying to hide it,

3238
02:06:43.730 --> 02:06:46.099
but just like instinctually pulling it

3239
02:06:46.099 --> 02:06:48.118
in a defensive, protective manner.

3240
02:06:48.118 --> 02:06:50.201
MARISHA: But is there a library?

3241
02:06:51.302 --> 02:06:53.223
MATT: "There's no library."

3242
02:06:53.223 --> 02:06:56.939
You asking-- make an insight check.

3243
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:59.632
SAM: Library heist.

3244
02:06:59.632 --> 02:07:01.211
LIAM: Don't lie to us, we know there's a library.

3245
02:07:01.211 --> 02:07:02.590
MARISHA: Ooh, fucking library.

3246
02:07:02.590 --> 02:07:04.436
TALIESIN: Show me your goddamn library!

3247
02:07:04.436 --> 02:07:06.882
SAM: Hold her out the window.

3248
02:07:06.882 --> 02:07:09.015
LIAM: The library's in the chair, isn't it?
MARISHA: 13.

3249
02:07:09.015 --> 02:07:10.365
13?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3250
02:07:10.365 --> 02:07:12.055
MATT: Kind of hard to tell.

3251
02:07:12.055 --> 02:07:13.704
You're not sure if she's telling the truth or not,

3252
02:07:13.704 --> 02:07:15.163
but she seems definitely protective

3253
02:07:15.163 --> 02:07:16.935
of the book that she's holding.

3254
02:07:16.935 --> 02:07:20.407
LIAM: What is that book that you're reading, is it good?

3255
02:07:20.407 --> 02:07:23.918
MATT: "I didn't read it, I wrote in notes and parts of it.

3256
02:07:23.918 --> 02:07:26.047
"This was the one that--"
LIAM: Oh, a journal.

3257
02:07:26.047 --> 02:07:29.716
MATT: "Yeah, it's more of a chronicle, I guess you'd say.

3258
02:07:29.716 --> 02:07:31.686
"Various things we hear from the outside,

3259
02:07:31.686 --> 02:07:34.287
"and when folks come and bring us books

3260
02:07:34.287 --> 02:07:36.629
"and historical elements, you know, we don't get to go

3261
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:38.818
"a lot of places, so it's good for me to read them,

3262
02:07:38.818 --> 02:07:42.286
"and I learn to know about it and to keep track of it."

3263
02:07:42.286 --> 02:07:43.844
LAURA: Do you want me to write down some stuff

3264
02:07:43.844 --> 02:07:46.034
that you could learn?

3265
02:07:46.034 --> 02:07:48.788
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3266
02:07:48.788 --> 02:07:50.813
TALIESIN: Oh no, going to trade books.

3267
02:07:50.813 --> 02:07:52.552
MATT: That doesn't count, you got to roll it--

3268
02:07:52.552 --> 02:07:53.639
LAURA: That was a really good roll.

3269
02:07:53.639 --> 02:07:56.722
SAM: Better than that.
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

3270
02:07:58.223 --> 02:08:00.645
Where's-- thank you.

3271
02:08:00.645 --> 02:08:02.094
Couldn't find persuasion.

3272
02:08:02.094 --> 02:08:03.026
Where's persuasion?

3273
02:08:03.026 --> 02:08:04.307
Oh, 14.

3274
02:08:04.307 --> 02:08:09.248
MATT: Goes, "I mean, you seem nice enough.

3275
02:08:09.248 --> 02:08:11.468
"Sure."

3276
02:08:11.468 --> 02:08:14.012
LAURA: I sit down cross-legged on the floor and--

3277
02:08:14.012 --> 02:08:17.002
TALIESIN: They can be a lot, but I definitely
vouch for them.

3278
02:08:17.002 --> 02:08:18.925
MATT: She definitely stands over you.

3279
02:08:18.925 --> 02:08:21.458
LAURA: Yes, I'm writing very interesting things

3280
02:08:21.458 --> 02:08:22.546
about the world.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's nice,

3281
02:08:22.546 --> 02:08:24.519
Caduceus is vouching for you, Jester.

3282
02:08:24.519 --> 02:08:27.060
LAURA: Yes, it really is.

3283
02:08:28.845 --> 02:08:32.358
TALIESIN: Oh no.
LIAM: I am an avid reader.

3284
02:08:32.358 --> 02:08:34.325
And I don't want to force the issue,

3285
02:08:34.325 --> 02:08:35.360
I don't want to be presumptuous,

3286
02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:38.440
but I would love to read your writing.

3287
02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:41.456
I don't know if you would consider loaning a book.

3288
02:08:41.456 --> 02:08:43.533
It has been a while.

3289
02:08:43.533 --> 02:08:45.765
MATT: "Loaning not so much, but if you're curious

3290
02:08:45.765 --> 02:08:48.728
"and you want to read some specific tidbits,

3291
02:08:48.728 --> 02:08:52.487
"maybe I can, you know, make them available."

3292
02:08:52.487 --> 02:08:54.003
LIAM: Is it all your writing or it's multiple--

3293
02:08:54.003 --> 02:08:56.645
MATT: "Oh no, it's generations and generations,

3294
02:08:56.645 --> 02:08:58.300
"I'm just the current Loremaster."

3295
02:08:58.300 --> 02:08:59.133
LIAM: Oh.

3296
02:08:59.133 --> 02:09:03.136
Maybe the oldest, could I read the earlier parts?

3297
02:09:03.136 --> 02:09:04.769
MATT: "S-sure.

3298
02:09:05.815 --> 02:09:06.648
"All right."

3299
02:09:06.648 --> 02:09:08.724
TRAVIS: Don't you have some books you could trade?

3300
02:09:08.724 --> 02:09:12.526
TALIESIN: Have you read everything, or a lot of what's here?

3301
02:09:12.526 --> 02:09:15.344
MATT: "I have, I've a lot of time here."

3302
02:09:15.344 --> 02:09:18.341
TALIESIN: Have you read anything about the Crawling King?

3303
02:09:18.341 --> 02:09:20.533
MATT: "You know, all the tales of the Calamity

3304
02:09:20.533 --> 02:09:24.500
"and certain elements of his doings.

3305
02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:27.273
"Torog, that's the name of him, big nasty fella,

3306
02:09:27.273 --> 02:09:30.374
"worm under the planet."

3307
02:09:30.374 --> 02:09:32.775
TALIESIN: He's a problem again at the moment, so.

3308
02:09:32.775 --> 02:09:34.432
MATT: "That's not good."

3309
02:09:34.432 --> 02:09:35.265
TALIESIN: No.

3310
02:09:35.265 --> 02:09:38.140
MARISHA: Yeah, you haven't happened to

3311
02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:41.448
have any pesky demons,

3312
02:09:41.448 --> 02:09:46.448
you know, fiendish infestations around the mountain?

3313
02:09:47.201 --> 02:09:48.862
MATT: "No."
MARISHA: By chance.

3314
02:09:48.862 --> 02:09:49.695
MATT: "Should we?"

3315
02:09:49.695 --> 02:09:53.618
TRAVIS: No pesky demon weapon killing items, do ya?

3316
02:09:53.618 --> 02:09:56.377
MATT: "Fresh out, I'm afraid.

3317
02:09:56.377 --> 02:09:57.444
"Sorry about that."

3318
02:09:57.444 --> 02:09:59.444
TALIESIN: It's been a hard year.

3319
02:10:00.976 --> 02:10:03.644
MATT: "You all do look a bit haggard."

3320
02:10:03.644 --> 02:10:05.477
TALIESIN: It's been haggaring.

3321
02:10:06.584 --> 02:10:11.201
I suppose, other than just reading about my family

3322
02:10:11.201 --> 02:10:13.951
to see if they may have mentioned

3323
02:10:13.951 --> 02:10:17.231
where they're going after this, or what their plans were--

3324
02:10:17.231 --> 02:10:19.730
MATT: "I think they were going to the Stones."

3325
02:10:19.730 --> 02:10:21.470
TALIESIN: All three of them?

3326
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:23.489
MATT: "Well, I think they were eventually
making their way there."

3327
02:10:23.489 --> 02:10:24.903
LAURA: The Stones.

3328
02:10:24.903 --> 02:10:26.036
The Stones.

3329
02:10:26.036 --> 02:10:26.869
SAM: What stones?

3330
02:10:26.869 --> 02:10:28.829
LAURA: The Stones, Whitestone.

3331
02:10:28.829 --> 02:10:31.266
TALIESIN: No, no, the Stones is a family.

3332
02:10:31.266 --> 02:10:35.393
LAURA: Yeah, but what if they're in Whitestone?

3333
02:10:35.393 --> 02:10:37.257
TALIESIN: Is Whitestone south?

3334
02:10:37.257 --> 02:10:39.489
LAURA: I don't know, I don't know where Whitestone is.

3335
02:10:39.489 --> 02:10:40.857
TALIESIN: Where's that?

3336
02:10:40.857 --> 02:10:43.260
SAM: It's in--
TALIESIN: I damn well it isn't.

3337
02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.681
SAM: It's in Tal'Dorei. <i>Tal</i>-dorey.

3338
02:10:45.681 --> 02:10:48.401
(laughter)

3339
02:10:48.401 --> 02:10:49.925
It's in Calgary.

3340
02:10:49.925 --> 02:10:51.158
(laughter)

3341
02:10:51.158 --> 02:10:53.975
TALIESIN: All three temples are in the continent.

3342
02:10:53.975 --> 02:10:55.445
TRAVIS: They have a good rodeo there.

3343
02:10:55.445 --> 02:10:56.578
TALIESIN: Good rodeo.

3344
02:10:56.578 --> 02:10:57.911
SAM: Just happened.

3345
02:10:59.814 --> 02:11:01.072
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3346
02:11:01.072 --> 02:11:06.072
Nothing else that they mention-- and it was

3347
02:11:06.608 --> 02:11:10.732
my mom, my aunt, and was it one of the sisters who,

3348
02:11:10.732 --> 02:11:12.898
just to make sure I got them all right.

3349
02:11:12.898 --> 02:11:17.890
MATT: Jeramess is like, "It was Constance and Corrin,
I believe,

3350
02:11:18.917 --> 02:11:20.465
and Colton.
TALIESIN: Colton.

3351
02:11:20.465 --> 02:11:21.756
All right.

3352
02:11:22.746 --> 02:11:27.007
MARISHA: Constance, Corrin, and Colton.

3353
02:11:27.007 --> 02:11:29.295
TALIESIN: Why are you looking at me like that?

3354
02:11:29.295 --> 02:11:31.020
TRAVIS: Clay.

3355
02:11:32.801 --> 02:11:34.363
LIAM: Just noticing the themes.

3356
02:11:34.363 --> 02:11:37.258
TALIESIN: I thought I knew every face you made,

3357
02:11:37.258 --> 02:11:39.434
this is a new one, I don't actually have

3358
02:11:39.434 --> 02:11:42.540
any reference for it at all.

3359
02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:45.386
TRAVIS: Could be gas.
TALIESIN: Yeah, could be gas.

3360
02:11:45.386 --> 02:11:46.838
MARISHA: It's been a long journey.

3361
02:11:46.838 --> 02:11:49.552
TALIESIN: You don't happen to have hot springs here

3362
02:11:49.552 --> 02:11:51.385
by any chance, do you?

3363
02:11:54.218 --> 02:11:59.218
Or crystals anywhere, or god forbid,

3364
02:11:59.719 --> 02:12:02.307
anywhere where I can find some spores

3365
02:12:02.307 --> 02:12:03.835
or something living in these caves?

3366
02:12:03.835 --> 02:12:07.359
I would like to get a sense of if there's any life in here.

3367
02:12:07.359 --> 02:12:09.201
Something that likes the heat.

3368
02:12:09.201 --> 02:12:11.565
MATT: "I mean, there's all sorts of strange mold

3369
02:12:11.565 --> 02:12:14.112
"that gathers in certain places.

3370
02:12:14.112 --> 02:12:15.494
"Try not to eat that.

3371
02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:18.825
"Looking for places to bathe, honestly, right down

3372
02:12:18.825 --> 02:12:20.486
"at the base of the lake during the day,

3373
02:12:20.486 --> 02:12:22.154
"about maybe 100 feet back from where

3374
02:12:22.154 --> 02:12:26.526
"the magma hits the surface, water's actually pretty warm."

3375
02:12:26.526 --> 02:12:27.359
SAM: Cool.

3376
02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:32.111
TALIESIN: Any lichen down there or otherwise, something--

3377
02:12:32.111 --> 02:12:33.479
MATT: "Maybe?"
TALIESIN: All right.

3378
02:12:33.479 --> 02:12:35.915
MATT: "There's plenty of game on the outskirts.

3379
02:12:35.915 --> 02:12:38.595
"Khemdal does a lot of hunting for us and--"

3380
02:12:38.595 --> 02:12:40.639
TALIESIN: Spirits don't bother you while you're bathing?

3381
02:12:40.639 --> 02:12:42.772
MATT: "Like I said, pay them no mind, they won't pay you."

3382
02:12:42.772 --> 02:12:44.568
TALIESIN: They seemed to like-- we were reading to them,

3383
02:12:44.568 --> 02:12:46.710
or Jester was reading to them.
LAURA: Tusk Love.

3384
02:12:46.710 --> 02:12:48.266
I hold up the book.
TRAVIS: Oh no.

3385
02:12:48.266 --> 02:12:51.231
MATT: You see Tyla goes, "I haven't read that one,

3386
02:12:51.231 --> 02:12:52.275
"what's that one about?"

3387
02:12:52.275 --> 02:12:54.106
LAURA: Oh, it's really good, do you want to borrow it,

3388
02:12:54.106 --> 02:12:55.270
I mean, for as long as we're here,

3389
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:56.717
we're going to be here overnight maybe?

3390
02:12:56.717 --> 02:12:58.175
MATT: "Sure."
LAURA: Okay, good.

3391
02:12:58.175 --> 02:13:00.014
MARISHA: Have you read Ghost Dick?

3392
02:13:00.014 --> 02:13:00.943
Same author.

3393
02:13:00.943 --> 02:13:02.748
SAM: (laughing)

3394
02:13:02.748 --> 02:13:04.876
MATT: "No, but if you guys are going to Uthodurn,

3395
02:13:04.876 --> 02:13:06.850
"if you could pick me up a copy maybe,
if you're coming back."

3396
02:13:06.850 --> 02:13:07.683
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

3397
02:13:07.683 --> 02:13:08.750
LIAM: Yeah, it's a crime story.

3398
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:09.620
MARISHA: Yeah, you'd love it.

3399
02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:12.110
TRAVIS: Very rare, very rare, hard to find.

3400
02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:14.506
MATT: All right, as you guys sit down to begin

3401
02:13:14.506 --> 02:13:16.286
making your notes into her book

3402
02:13:16.286 --> 02:13:17.598
and as you watch over the shoulder

3403
02:13:17.598 --> 02:13:20.739
and begin a conversation about exchanging information,

3404
02:13:20.739 --> 02:13:22.490
and the rest of you are shown to your quarters

3405
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:25.795
here within the Cinderrest Sanctum, the Burning Lodge,

3406
02:13:25.795 --> 02:13:27.630
we're going to go ahead and take a break.

3407
02:13:27.630 --> 02:13:30.157
We'll be back here in a few minutes.

3408
02:13:30.157 --> 02:13:32.857
And Ghost Dick.

3409
02:13:32.857 --> 02:13:36.445
Before we leave, we do have our giveaway.

3410
02:13:36.445 --> 02:13:39.805
We have a-- I'm going to mispronounce them always,

3411
02:13:39.805 --> 02:13:44.588
delightfully bright orange padauk wood?

3412
02:13:44.588 --> 02:13:45.835
Padauk dice vault?

3413
02:13:45.835 --> 02:13:47.259
It's a really, really cool color.

3414
02:13:47.259 --> 02:13:49.885
This we'll be giving away to one of you lucky winners

3415
02:13:49.885 --> 02:13:52.098
from our friends at Wyrmwood.

3416
02:13:52.098 --> 02:13:56.331
Tonight's code word is "volcano."

3417
02:13:56.331 --> 02:13:58.688
Put the word volcano once--

MATT: (same weird noises)

3420
02:14:01.905 --> 02:14:04.070
MATT: Put the word once in to the chat,

3421
02:14:04.070 --> 02:14:05.662
more than that and you'll be disqualified,

3422
02:14:05.662 --> 02:14:08.636
and for US and Canada only, excluding Quebec.

3423
02:14:08.636 --> 02:14:10.368
We'll have our winner here shortly.

3424

(whooshing)

3445
02:15:11.034 --> 02:15:13.338
BENWIN: Hi, Benwin Bronzebottom, celebrity dwarf

3446
02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:14.655
and video game enthusiast,

3447
02:15:14.655 --> 02:15:16.113
and this is my sidekick Crowy.

3448
02:15:16.113 --> 02:15:16.954
CROWY: Hello.

3449
02:15:16.954 --> 02:15:18.542
BENWIN: We're here to tell you about Idle Champions

3450
02:15:18.542 --> 02:15:21.068
of the Forgotten Realms, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons based

3451
02:15:21.068 --> 02:15:23.587
strategy management game from Code Name Entertainment.

3452
02:15:23.587 --> 02:15:25.921
They're Canadian, so you know it's good.

3453
02:15:25.921 --> 02:15:28.320
CROWY: Let's talk about the game.
Did you ever play Cookie Clicker?

3454
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:29.275
BENWIN: Of course not.

3455
02:15:29.275 --> 02:15:30.985
CROWY: This game is a management game like that,

3456
02:15:30.985 --> 02:15:33.005
but with far more emphasis on strategy,

3457
02:15:33.005 --> 02:15:35.192
and with a flavoring of D&amp;D's lore and legendary heroes,

3458
02:15:35.192 --> 02:15:36.742
you can unlock your favorite champions,

3459
02:15:36.742 --> 02:15:39.447
like Farideh from Erin M. Evans' Brimstone Angels saga,

3460
02:15:39.447 --> 02:15:41.263
Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate,

3461
02:15:41.263 --> 02:15:42.778
and the fourth and final member

3462
02:15:42.778 --> 02:15:44.157
of Acquisitions Incorporated The C-Team,

3463
02:15:44.157 --> 02:15:46.703
Amy Falcone's Walnut Dankgrass.

3464
02:15:46.703 --> 02:15:47.803
BENWIN: The K is silent.

3465
02:15:47.803 --> 02:15:49.581
CROWY: Create the best adventuring party possible

3466
02:15:49.581 --> 02:15:52.111
based on formation options, your character's ability,

3467
02:15:52.111 --> 02:15:53.907
and the obstacles and enemies you face.

3468
02:15:53.907 --> 02:15:55.809
BENWIN: Or you just randomly click on things like I do

3469
02:15:55.809 --> 02:15:56.778
and hope for the best.

3470
02:15:56.778 --> 02:15:58.553
CROWY: You can click on enemies to assist your champions,

3471
02:15:58.553 --> 02:16:00.156
or you can set 'em up and walk away

3472
02:16:00.156 --> 02:16:02.232
and let 'em do their thing, it's entirely up to you.

3473
02:16:02.232 --> 02:16:03.940
BENWIN: I'm playing on the toilet right now.

3474
02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:05.060
CROWY: Why wouldn't you be?

3475
02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:07.108
Idle Champions is available on all your favorite

3476
02:16:07.108 --> 02:16:08.862
gaming platforms, including tablets,

3477
02:16:08.862 --> 02:16:11.034
for the low, low price of free.

3478
02:16:11.034 --> 02:16:12.090
So download it now.

3479
02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:13.024
BENWIN: End with joke.

3480
02:16:13.024 --> 02:16:13.910
CROWY: You're not supposed to read--

3481
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:14.743
BENWIN: It says end with joke.

3482
02:16:14.743 --> 02:16:16.457
CROWY: No, we're supposed to come up with a joke to go

3483
02:16:16.457 --> 02:16:18.164
where it says "end with joke."

3484
02:16:18.164 --> 02:16:20.088
BENWIN: Oh, I don't know, "end with joke" is pretty funny.

3485
02:16:20.088 --> 02:16:22.545
CROWY: Wait, on three, ready?
One, two, three.

3486
02:16:22.545 --> 02:16:23.970
BOTH: End with joke.

3487
02:16:23.970 --> 02:16:25.540
(both laughing)

3488
02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:28.624
BENWIN: I think it's funny, it's very funny.

3489
02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:33.266
TALIESIN: Good evening, my devilish bees.

3490
02:16:33.266 --> 02:16:36.023
I'm here to tell you about a very special one-shot

3491
02:16:36.023 --> 02:16:38.079
coming to the Critical Role channel,

3492
02:16:38.079 --> 02:16:41.544
brought to you by our good friends at Chaosium.

3493
02:16:41.544 --> 02:16:44.933
What shadows lurk about the Crystal Palace?

3494
02:16:44.933 --> 02:16:49.933
Find out this Monday, July 29th, at 7:00pm Pacific.

3495
02:16:50.014 --> 02:16:51.698
If you miss the live broadcast,

3496
02:16:51.698 --> 02:16:54.656
you can catch the VOD on YouTube,

3497
02:16:54.656 --> 02:16:57.142
Wednesday, July 31st.

3498
02:16:57.142 --> 02:16:59.507
I'll be joined by a wonderful cast of characters,

3499
02:16:59.507 --> 02:17:02.642
including Marisha Ray, Erika Ishii,

3500
02:17:02.642 --> 02:17:06.384
Liam O'Brien, Phil Lamarr, Ashly Burch,

3501
02:17:06.384 --> 02:17:09.408
and the sure to be terrified

3502
02:17:09.408 --> 02:17:13.580
Travis Willingham.

3503
02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:16.663
I may have chewed that a little hard.

3504
02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:20.243
(clearing throat)

3505
02:17:20.243 --> 02:17:21.326
See you soon.

3506
02:17:22.490 --> 02:17:25.573
(somber organ music)

3507
02:17:33.117 --> 02:17:35.897
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

3508
02:17:35.897 --> 02:17:38.066
BRIAN: This year we have a really special treat.

3509
02:17:38.066 --> 02:17:41.909
For the first time ever, we are excited to show you

3510
02:17:41.909 --> 02:17:44.839
the first three never before seen pages

3511
02:17:44.839 --> 02:17:47.453
of the second issue, which comes out August 14th,

3512
02:17:47.453 --> 02:17:50.000
write it down, put it in your phone.

3513
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.547
But, that's cool, but what's even cooler

3514
02:17:53.547 --> 02:17:55.768
is instead of just showing it to you,

3515
02:17:55.768 --> 02:17:58.057
we're going to have the cast do a readthrough

3516
02:17:58.057 --> 02:18:00.262
of those three pages.

3517
02:18:00.262 --> 02:18:02.611
[cheering]

3518
02:18:02.611 --> 02:18:03.986
That sound fun?

3519
02:18:03.986 --> 02:18:05.855
Sounds fun to me.

3520
02:18:05.855 --> 02:18:08.622
All right, Matthew Mercer.

3521
02:18:08.622 --> 02:18:11.959
MATT: All righty, so-- okay, we're ready then.

3522
02:18:11.959 --> 02:18:13.801
LAURA: We're doing it?
MATT: We're doing it live!

3523
02:18:13.801 --> 02:18:16.322
All right, so, for those of you who have caught up,

3524
02:18:16.322 --> 02:18:19.175
this takes place in Westruun, shortly after meeting Pike

3525
02:18:19.175 --> 02:18:22.093
and searching as to how Grog has managed

3526
02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:24.424
to vanish from the group, which is actually how

3527
02:18:24.424 --> 02:18:26.781
the second session of our home campaign began.

3528
02:18:26.781 --> 02:18:28.269
So, beginning.

3529
02:18:28.269 --> 02:18:31.020
(clears throat)

3530
02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:32.845
(as Wilhand, an old man) "Grog, my boy,

3531
02:18:32.845 --> 02:18:35.426
"what are you doing at Gatshadow?

3532
02:18:35.426 --> 02:18:38.847
"A bad place, a very bad place."

3533
02:18:38.847 --> 02:18:42.002
LIAM: (as Vax) Don't worry, we'll find him.

3534
02:18:42.002 --> 02:18:44.905
MARISHA: (as Keyleth) What can you tell us about Gatshadow,

3535
02:18:44.905 --> 02:18:46.731
Mr. Trickfoot?

3536
02:18:46.731 --> 02:18:47.564
MATT: "Mm?

3537
02:18:47.564 --> 02:18:52.544
"Well, many around here call it the Cursed Mountain.

3538
02:18:52.544 --> 02:18:56.155
"They say madness lies deep beneath the rock.

3539
02:18:56.155 --> 02:19:00.837
"A power that draws all manner of vile things to it."

3540
02:19:00.837 --> 02:19:02.718
SAM: (as Scanlan) Heh, vile, huh?

3541
02:19:02.718 --> 02:19:06.042
That's certainly one way to describe Grog.

3542
02:19:06.042 --> 02:19:07.567
Big idiot.

3543
02:19:08.645 --> 02:19:13.371
ASHLEY: (as Pike) It's okay to be worried about him.

3544
02:19:13.371 --> 02:19:15.518
We'd better get going.

3545
02:19:15.518 --> 02:19:16.663
LAURA: (As Vex) We?

3546
02:19:16.663 --> 02:19:18.596
We're a "we" now?

3547
02:19:20.937 --> 02:19:22.317
SAM: Oh, that's my line.

3548
02:19:22.317 --> 02:19:23.685
[laughter]

3549
02:19:23.685 --> 02:19:26.121
I was entranced by your goddamn acting.

3550
02:19:26.121 --> 02:19:28.370
(laughter)

3551
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:30.567
It's going to be incredibly dangerous.

3552
02:19:30.567 --> 02:19:31.821
You should really stay here.

3553
02:19:31.821 --> 02:19:34.076
You know, leave this to the professionals.

3554
02:19:34.076 --> 02:19:36.153
ASHLEY: I know it's dangerous.

3555
02:19:36.153 --> 02:19:39.028
That's what the armor and the weapons are for.

3556
02:19:39.028 --> 02:19:41.439
Grog is my friend, and if he's in trouble,

3557
02:19:41.439 --> 02:19:42.939
I'm going to help.

3558
02:19:44.053 --> 02:19:46.869
Besides, the Everlight can provide us

3559
02:19:46.869 --> 02:19:49.181
guidance in finding him.

3560
02:19:49.181 --> 02:19:52.459
Unless one of you happens to be a cleric.

3561
02:19:52.459 --> 02:19:55.126
LIAM: I guess we're a "we" now.

3562
02:19:57.010 --> 02:19:58.249
MATT: "Good luck!

3563
02:19:58.249 --> 02:19:59.999
"Keep them safe, Pike!"

3564
02:20:00.965 --> 02:20:03.895
ASHLEY: Aww, well aren't you just the cutest!

3565
02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:04.869
(Laura laughing)

3566
02:20:04.869 --> 02:20:06.654
SAM: Aww, I wish I was a bear.

3567
02:20:06.654 --> 02:20:08.246
[laughter]

3568
02:20:08.246 --> 02:20:12.005
TRAVIS: (horse galloping and neighing)

3569
02:20:12.005 --> 02:20:13.520
(Sam laughing)

3570
02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.566
(Travis imitates a fart)

3571
02:20:14.566 --> 02:20:16.735
(laughter)

3572
02:20:16.735 --> 02:20:18.942
MARISHA: Pardon my asking, Pike,

3573
02:20:18.942 --> 02:20:22.130
but how did Grog come to live in your home?

3574
02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:25.521
He's just, well, he--

3575
02:20:25.521 --> 02:20:27.353
he's so...

3576
02:20:27.353 --> 02:20:28.517
ASHLEY: Big?

3577
02:20:28.517 --> 02:20:29.513
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah.

3578
02:20:29.513 --> 02:20:32.594
[laughter]

3579
02:20:32.594 --> 02:20:33.733
SAM: End of scene.

3580
02:20:33.733 --> 02:20:34.911
BRIAN: There you go.

3581
02:20:34.911 --> 02:20:35.942
There you go.

3582
02:20:35.942 --> 02:20:38.783
[cheering]

3583
02:20:38.783 --> 02:20:39.962
MATT: Just a tease.

3584
02:20:39.962 --> 02:20:41.498
A little tease.
LAURA: Yeah.

3585
02:20:41.498 --> 02:20:43.373
RYAN: Hello, my name's Ryan.

3586
02:20:43.373 --> 02:20:44.916
My question's for Matt.

3587
02:20:44.916 --> 02:20:46.083
Matt, I'm actually a close friend

3588
02:20:46.083 --> 02:20:47.944
of your personal trainer, Ferris.

3589
02:20:47.944 --> 02:20:49.202
MATT: Oh, no way!

3590
02:20:49.202 --> 02:20:50.244
That's awesome!

3591
02:20:50.244 --> 02:20:51.713
RYAN: Yeah, so he may have mentioned

3592
02:20:51.713 --> 02:20:52.812
I'd be coming to ask a question.

3593
02:20:52.812 --> 02:20:54.117
MATT: Yeah, yeah, he talked about you the other day.

3594
02:20:54.117 --> 02:20:55.450
RYAN: Sorta related to that,

3595
02:20:55.450 --> 02:20:57.661
I know with your busy schedule with voice acting,

3596
02:20:57.661 --> 02:20:59.323
all the gigs you get,

3597
02:20:59.323 --> 02:21:02.164
what goes into the mental and maybe even

3598
02:21:02.164 --> 02:21:05.111
physical preparation of DMing for Critical Role every week?

3599
02:21:05.111 --> 02:21:06.519
MATT: That's a good question.

3600
02:21:06.519 --> 02:21:08.350
TRAVIS: Yeah, paint us a picture.

3601
02:21:08.350 --> 02:21:10.298

(Travis singing "Eye of the Tiger")

3604
02:21:15.444 --> 02:21:17.600
MATT: I'm working on that, honestly.

3605
02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:19.946
You know, all of this is very exciting,

3606
02:21:19.946 --> 02:21:23.582
it's also very-- it's incredible, it's time consuming,

3607
02:21:23.582 --> 02:21:27.173
in the best way, and it's also something that is scary.

3608
02:21:27.173 --> 02:21:29.341
You know, all of this attention

3609
02:21:29.341 --> 02:21:31.413
and all this, you know, positivity,

3610
02:21:31.413 --> 02:21:33.983
it's a very scary thing for us to handle

3611
02:21:33.983 --> 02:21:35.510
and be the front of, but that also makes us

3612
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:36.586
want to protect it that much more,

3613
02:21:36.586 --> 02:21:39.246
so there's a lot of effort going into

3614
02:21:39.246 --> 02:21:41.711
my own mental health and us checking in as friends,

3615
02:21:41.711 --> 02:21:44.934
and making sure that that thread is still the baseline,

3616
02:21:44.934 --> 02:21:46.271
like I mentioned earlier.

3617
02:21:46.271 --> 02:21:49.155
Yeah, all these things I'm trying to be better about.

3618
02:21:49.155 --> 02:21:51.600
It's an ongoing process, and I'm not always the best at it,

3619
02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:54.013
and I falter and I stumble and I pick myself back up,

3620
02:21:54.013 --> 02:21:56.021
but I think that accountability's been really helpful

3621
02:21:56.021 --> 02:21:59.197
for me, both from my friends and from your friend Ferris

3622
02:21:59.197 --> 02:22:01.229
kicking my ass during the week.

3623
02:22:01.229 --> 02:22:04.419
Yeah, just trying to make the push to do that.

3624
02:22:04.419 --> 02:22:06.019
You don't have to be perfect at it,

3625
02:22:06.019 --> 02:22:09.029
but just making the effort, knowing it's okay to stumble,

3626
02:22:09.029 --> 02:22:11.087
and then just pick yourself back up and keep going forward

3627
02:22:11.087 --> 02:22:12.245
has been huge for me.

3628
02:22:12.245 --> 02:22:13.684
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question's for Sam,

3629
02:22:13.684 --> 02:22:16.004
it's kind of a jokey thing, but it's been in my brain

3630
02:22:16.004 --> 02:22:18.721
since Nott's whole deal came out.

3631
02:22:18.721 --> 02:22:22.525
Is there a particular reason why you chose to play

3632
02:22:22.525 --> 02:22:25.622

3633
02:22:25.622 --> 02:22:27.406

(laughter)

3641
02:22:41.987 --> 02:22:46.460
The small thing is partly because of Liam O'Brien,

3642
02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:49.946
because he picks my characters for me.

3643
02:22:49.946 --> 02:22:53.258
Also because, even though I'm a six-foot-tall man,

3644
02:22:53.258 --> 02:22:56.120
I have like a small man disease,

3645
02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:00.575
where I just feel like I should be even bigger.

3646
02:23:00.575 --> 02:23:02.515

MATT: Yeah, you didn't know about Kaylie
in the first campaign.

3649
02:23:07.587 --> 02:23:08.572
SAM: I did not.

3650
02:23:08.572 --> 02:23:13.555
It was-- I mean, Kaylie is probably not alone, right?

MATT: You now get to roll with enthusiasm, history checks.

3778
02:42:38.002 --> 02:42:39.081
LAURA: Hey.
LIAM: Ooh.

3779
02:42:39.081 --> 02:42:41.481
MATT: (laughing)

3780
02:42:41.481 --> 02:42:42.580
TRAVIS: Hey, Jester?

3781
02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:43.827
LAURA: Yeah?

3782
02:42:43.827 --> 02:42:46.824
TRAVIS: You got that thing where you send messages, right?

3783
02:42:46.824 --> 02:42:48.450
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3784
02:42:48.450 --> 02:42:49.784
TRAVIS: Do you have any more of those?

3785
02:42:49.784 --> 02:42:52.620
LAURA: Yeah, I've got a bunch.

3786
02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:55.351
TRAVIS: Can I ask, like, a favor?

3787
02:42:55.351 --> 02:42:56.506
LAURA: Of course.

3788
02:42:56.506 --> 02:42:59.567
You can ask anything, Fjord.

3789
02:42:59.567 --> 02:43:01.150
TRAVIS: If I, like,

3790
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:04.683
conjured an image of what Vandran looks like,

3791
02:43:04.683 --> 02:43:07.647
could you send him a message?

3792
02:43:07.647 --> 02:43:10.738
LAURA: I can give it a try, yeah.

3793
02:43:10.738 --> 02:43:12.239
TRAVIS: Okay.

3794
02:43:12.239 --> 02:43:14.504
I'll use Minor Illusion to just create

3795
02:43:14.504 --> 02:43:17.325
a little relief of what his face looks like.

3796
02:43:17.325 --> 02:43:18.666
MATT: Okay.

3797
02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:22.590
LAURA: What do you want me to say to him?

3798
02:43:25.257 --> 02:43:27.298
TRAVIS: Will you just ask him--

3799
02:43:28.999 --> 02:43:32.147
tell him that I'm okay,

3800
02:43:32.147 --> 02:43:33.064
and if--

3801
02:43:34.617 --> 02:43:36.902
I don't know.

3802
02:43:36.902 --> 02:43:39.652
I want to know how he's doing, but--

3803
02:43:41.244 --> 02:43:43.397
Caduceus checked in with the Wildmother

3804
02:43:43.397 --> 02:43:46.681
and said that he was trying to atone for his past.

3805
02:43:48.337 --> 02:43:50.861
I'm not sure what to say.

3806
02:43:50.861 --> 02:43:53.376
I just feel like he doesn't care to be found,

3807
02:43:53.376 --> 02:43:55.291
or I don't know what he wants.

3808
02:43:55.291 --> 02:43:58.601
LAURA: Maybe he doesn't know you're alive either.

3809
02:43:58.601 --> 02:44:01.471
Maybe he's been searching for you.

3810
02:44:01.471 --> 02:44:03.388
TRAVIS: I guess that's right.

3811
02:44:04.716 --> 02:44:09.570
Would you do me a solid and just do what you do?

3812
02:44:09.570 --> 02:44:11.405
LAURA: Sure.

3813
02:44:11.405 --> 02:44:12.238
TRAVIS: Okay.

3814
02:44:13.487 --> 02:44:15.197
LAURA: Okay, I'll cast Sending.

3815
02:44:15.197 --> 02:44:16.756
MATT: The image of Vandran as it appears,

3816
02:44:16.756 --> 02:44:19.530
you can see looks to be a human man

3817
02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:22.180
in his maybe early 50s or so.

3818
02:44:23.972 --> 02:44:26.453
Skin battered,

3819
02:44:26.453 --> 02:44:31.277
skin tanned from years at sea under the beating sun.

3820
02:44:31.277 --> 02:44:35.593
Ashen blond beard that goes down

3821
02:44:35.593 --> 02:44:37.407
to about the clavicle.

3822
02:44:38.354 --> 02:44:40.471
A kind but hard face.

3823
02:44:42.441 --> 02:44:45.926
One of the ears looks slightly cauliflowered on one side.

3824
02:44:45.926 --> 02:44:47.759
LAURA: Been in some fights.

3825
02:44:49.004 --> 02:44:52.726
MATT: You can see the hairline's receding on the top a bit,

3826
02:44:52.726 --> 02:44:55.041
but it is long across the shoulders.

3827
02:44:55.041 --> 02:44:57.117
LAURA: What about his eyes, what color are they?

3828
02:44:57.117 --> 02:44:59.126
MATT: The eyes themselves actually would be

3829
02:44:59.126 --> 02:45:02.021
a deep blue-green color.

3830
02:45:02.021 --> 02:45:05.117
Very pretty, though very much hidden in amongst

3831
02:45:05.117 --> 02:45:09.551
what would be not considered a handsome face classically,

3832
02:45:09.551 --> 02:45:11.158
but definitely a face of someone who's

3833
02:45:11.158 --> 02:45:14.325
seen much of the world, it would seem.

3834
02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:19.366
LAURA: Okay.

3835
02:45:23.796 --> 02:45:25.673
Oh, I hope I'm not bothering him,

3836
02:45:25.673 --> 02:45:29.256
after what you guys said, maybe-- it's fine.

3837
02:45:32.239 --> 02:45:33.380
Hello!

3838
02:45:34.537 --> 02:45:36.512
You don't know me.

3839
02:45:37.352 --> 02:45:39.677
I'm here with Fjord.

3840
02:45:42.104 --> 02:45:46.612
He wants you to know he's okay and

3841
02:45:46.612 --> 02:45:49.278
he's thinking about you.

3842
02:45:51.943 --> 02:45:53.776
Where can he find you?

3843
02:46:00.765 --> 02:46:01.858
MATT: Okay.

3844
02:46:01.858 --> 02:46:04.243
(laughter)

3845
02:46:04.243 --> 02:46:05.548
SAM: Is Fjord your real name?

3846
02:46:05.548 --> 02:46:07.689
Is he going to know what Fjord is?

3847
02:46:07.689 --> 02:46:08.610
LAURA: Are you here?

3848
02:46:08.610 --> 02:46:10.648
SAM: No, I'm Sam Riegel right here.

3849
02:46:10.648 --> 02:46:13.430
I'm an avid viewer of the show, I love it.

3850
02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:16.394
(laughter)

3851
02:46:16.394 --> 02:46:18.477
LIAM: Audience at this table.

3852
02:46:19.764 --> 02:46:21.397
MATT: All right.

3853
02:46:23.634 --> 02:46:25.632
LAURA: He's looking up a lot of stuff right now.

3854
02:46:25.632 --> 02:46:26.642
MARISHA: I know.
MATT: Sorry.

3855
02:46:26.642 --> 02:46:28.467
MARISHA: He's hittin' the doc.

3856
02:46:28.467 --> 02:46:30.014
LIAM: It's a big bump on the story.

3857
02:46:30.014 --> 02:46:30.847
MATT: Yeah.

3858
02:46:34.229 --> 02:46:38.777
A moment passes before a gravelly voice

3859
02:46:38.777 --> 02:46:40.694
comes through and goes,

3860
02:46:42.450 --> 02:46:45.508
"You said you know Fjord.

3861
02:46:49.288 --> 02:46:52.133
"I haven't heard that name in a while.

3862
02:46:53.241 --> 02:46:55.441
"Glad he's doing well.

3863
02:46:58.094 --> 02:46:59.269
"Let him know

3864
02:47:00.268 --> 02:47:02.035
"I'm okay.

3865
02:47:03.871 --> 02:47:07.846
"Retired on an island.

3866
02:47:10.587 --> 02:47:12.062
"Good folks.

3867
02:47:13.341 --> 02:47:14.908
"He'd like 'em."

3868
02:47:16.694 --> 02:47:17.861
And that's it.

3869
02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:22.230
SAM: Sam Elliott.

3870
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:25.186
LAURA: Did he say at the end "he'd like them" or--?

3871
02:47:25.186 --> 02:47:26.019
MATT: "He'd like it."

3872
02:47:26.019 --> 02:47:28.031
LAURA: He'd like it.

3873
02:47:28.031 --> 02:47:30.781
I repeat everything I just heard.

3874
02:47:33.100 --> 02:47:35.258
TRAVIS: Sounds like he's okay.

3875
02:47:35.258 --> 02:47:37.425
LAURA: He retired to an island?

3876
02:47:40.589 --> 02:47:42.864
TRAVIS: God, I've been so, like--

3877
02:47:44.272 --> 02:47:47.344
I feel like I need to find him,

3878
02:47:47.344 --> 02:47:51.094
and I just don't know if it's that important

3879
02:47:52.115 --> 02:47:53.515
to him.

3880
02:47:54.535 --> 02:47:59.075
I know it's important to me, we've done so much.

3881
02:47:59.075 --> 02:48:04.075
LAURA: Yeah, but I mean, the way
you talked about him, I mean,

3882
02:48:04.781 --> 02:48:08.148
if you need to find him then you need to find him.

3883
02:48:10.376 --> 02:48:12.222
TRAVIS: I feel like I need to find him

3884
02:48:12.222 --> 02:48:15.255
because I feel like I owe him.

3885
02:48:17.308 --> 02:48:20.577
But if he doesn't feel that way,

3886
02:48:20.577 --> 02:48:24.254
it might just be in my head.

3887
02:48:24.254 --> 02:48:28.362
LAURA: You know, messages are hard because

3888
02:48:28.362 --> 02:48:30.941
you can't see the person's face.

3889
02:48:30.941 --> 02:48:34.358
It did take him quite a while to respond.

3890
02:48:36.384 --> 02:48:37.217
TRAVIS: Right.

3891
02:48:37.217 --> 02:48:39.875
LAURA: For all he knows, I could be somebody bad

3892
02:48:39.875 --> 02:48:43.421
and just trying to get a response out of him.

3893
02:48:43.421 --> 02:48:45.962
He might not want to reveal too much.

3894
02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:51.525
TRAVIS: Sure, he was smart like that.

3895
02:48:54.657 --> 02:48:55.765
Thank you.

3896
02:48:57.188 --> 02:48:59.326
It's been a long time.

3897
02:48:59.326 --> 02:49:02.769
I just don't know if what I wanted before

3898
02:49:02.769 --> 02:49:06.561
is the same thing I want now.

3899
02:49:06.561 --> 02:49:08.483
LAURA: How <i>are</i> you doing?

3900
02:49:08.483 --> 02:49:12.677
You seemed really quiet when we were in Nicodranas.

3901
02:49:12.677 --> 02:49:17.535
You stood in the ocean and you didn't say anything.

3902
02:49:21.195 --> 02:49:24.133
TRAVIS: I feel like we've all changed.

3903
02:49:24.133 --> 02:49:25.777
LAURA: Yeah.

3904
02:49:25.777 --> 02:49:27.110
TRAVIS: Me especially.

3905
02:49:29.373 --> 02:49:32.190
He's such a brave man, and he did so much for me,

3906
02:49:32.190 --> 02:49:36.425
I just wanted to emulate that.

3907
02:49:36.425 --> 02:49:37.546
LAURA: I know.

3908
02:49:37.546 --> 02:49:41.129
TRAVIS: Repay that, pay it forward, I don't know.

3909
02:49:44.434 --> 02:49:48.107
I feel like I've been so obsessed with this sword

3910
02:49:48.107 --> 02:49:52.594
and how I got it, and Uk'otoa and the whole thing,

3911
02:49:52.594 --> 02:49:55.927
I just feel like there's more out there.

3912
02:49:57.511 --> 02:49:59.174
It's always more.

3913
02:49:59.174 --> 02:50:01.524
Even Port Damali and--

3914
02:50:02.566 --> 02:50:03.642
and before that,

3915
02:50:03.642 --> 02:50:07.738
my world just got bigger and bigger and bigger,

3916
02:50:07.738 --> 02:50:11.979
and the more time goes on, the more you realize there is,

3917
02:50:11.979 --> 02:50:14.135
and the more that we affect, and the more

3918
02:50:14.135 --> 02:50:16.135
we can be effected, and--

3919
02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:24.139
there's a part of me that wants to leave it all behind.

3920
02:50:24.139 --> 02:50:27.193
LAURA: Just go somewhere quiet and disappear,

3921
02:50:27.193 --> 02:50:30.610
and hope that it never bothers you again?

3922
02:50:31.972 --> 02:50:33.438
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3923
02:50:34.958 --> 02:50:37.639
LAURA: Yeah, I understand that.

3924
02:50:37.639 --> 02:50:40.472
TRAVIS: I just don't think it'll let me.

3925
02:50:45.629 --> 02:50:48.680
I feel like I'm trying to force something

3926
02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:51.597
that's not going to happen on its own.

3927
02:50:54.134 --> 02:50:58.751
LAURA: Do you feel scared when you think of Uk'otoa?

3928
02:50:59.722 --> 02:51:02.902
TRAVIS: I try not to think of Uk'otoa.

3929
02:51:02.902 --> 02:51:04.906
MARISHA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

3930
02:51:04.906 --> 02:51:06.764
LAURA: I mean, that's where your

3931
02:51:06.764 --> 02:51:09.505
magical powers came from, yeah?

3932
02:51:10.919 --> 02:51:12.917
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3933
02:51:12.917 --> 02:51:14.917
LAURA: You can't escape that.

3934
02:51:17.719 --> 02:51:20.212
TRAVIS: They left for a little bit.

3935
02:51:20.212 --> 02:51:21.403
LAURA: What?

3936
02:51:23.016 --> 02:51:24.749
TRAVIS: There was a night.

3937
02:51:26.708 --> 02:51:28.541
I woke up and the sword

3938
02:51:28.541 --> 02:51:31.016
was on the floor, and I--

3939
02:51:33.007 --> 02:51:34.582
I couldn't do anything.

3940
02:51:36.274 --> 02:51:38.474
LAURA: W-when was that?

3941
02:51:41.338 --> 02:51:42.505
TRAVIS: A while ago.

3942
02:51:43.639 --> 02:51:45.344
LAURA: Fjord, why didn't you say anything?

3943
02:51:45.344 --> 02:51:47.838
TRAVIS: I didn't know what to do.

3944
02:51:47.838 --> 02:51:50.157
LAURA: But it came back.

3945
02:51:50.157 --> 02:51:51.797
TRAVIS: In the middle of the day.

3946
02:51:51.797 --> 02:51:55.047
We were setting that ambush, and Yasha--

3947
02:51:57.249 --> 02:52:00.472
Yasha was getting those bracers made,

3948
02:52:00.472 --> 02:52:03.881
and they came back after a little bit, but

3949
02:52:04.968 --> 02:52:07.785
I didn't know if I was going to run or what.

3950
02:52:09.584 --> 02:52:11.540
LAURA: How did you feel when they were gone?

3951
02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:13.133
TRAVIS: Terrified.

3952
02:52:13.133 --> 02:52:14.201
LAURA: Did you want them back?

3953
02:52:14.201 --> 02:52:15.966
TRAVIS: Yes.

3954
02:52:15.966 --> 02:52:19.383
LAURA: Would you do anything to get them back?

3955
02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:22.231
TRAVIS: No.

3956
02:52:27.006 --> 02:52:28.406
No, but,

3957
02:52:31.559 --> 02:52:33.889
I feel like I knew what I was doing,

3958
02:52:33.889 --> 02:52:37.205
and I realized I have no idea.

3959
02:52:40.864 --> 02:52:43.231
LAURA: You're not the only one.

3960
02:52:43.231 --> 02:52:44.064
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3961
02:52:46.532 --> 02:52:47.365
Thank you.

3962
02:52:48.214 --> 02:52:53.155
That might've been just the check-in I needed.

3963
02:52:55.948 --> 02:52:58.859
LAURA: I wish I could be of more help, though.

3964
02:52:58.859 --> 02:53:00.840
TRAVIS: Oh, you have been.

3965
02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:03.066
I've known you the longest in this.

3966
02:53:03.066 --> 02:53:03.899
LAURA: Yeah.

3967
02:53:05.066 --> 02:53:09.409
TRAVIS: Sometimes it's just hard figuring out

3968
02:53:09.409 --> 02:53:13.342
who you <i>should</i> be,

3969
02:53:13.342 --> 02:53:15.958
instead of who you want to be.

3970
02:53:20.874 --> 02:53:25.799
LAURA: Maybe-- I mean, the Traveler gave me my powers.

3971
02:53:27.541 --> 02:53:30.966
Maybe, you-- you know,

3972
02:53:32.883 --> 02:53:34.757
don't follow Uk'otoa,

3973
02:53:34.757 --> 02:53:38.773
you could follow the Traveler, or someone else

3974
02:53:38.773 --> 02:53:43.407
who could give you powers that are even better.

3975
02:53:43.407 --> 02:53:45.740
TRAVIS: How do you feel about

3976
02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:49.187
Caduceus' deity, the Wildmother?

3977
02:53:49.187 --> 02:53:52.750
LAURA: The Wildmother?
TRAVIS: Yeah, Melora.

3978
02:53:52.750 --> 02:53:56.149
LAURA: I mean, I saw her,

3979
02:53:56.149 --> 02:53:58.624
when I was bringing Caduceus back.

3980
02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:00.433
TRAVIS: You did?

3981
02:54:00.433 --> 02:54:03.516
LAURA: Mm-hmm, she popped in for a second.

3982
02:54:05.203 --> 02:54:08.359
She seemed pretty nice, and she brought him back

3983
02:54:08.359 --> 02:54:10.291
from the dead, I mean, that's always a good thing,

3984
02:54:10.291 --> 02:54:12.781
that's really powerful stuff.

3985
02:54:12.781 --> 02:54:14.149
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3986
02:54:14.149 --> 02:54:15.597
LAURA: He talks to her a lot.

3987
02:54:15.597 --> 02:54:18.651
Not as much as I talk to the Traveler, you know.

3988
02:54:18.651 --> 02:54:20.842
Because the Traveler's always got my back and stuff.

3989
02:54:20.842 --> 02:54:21.675
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3990
02:54:21.675 --> 02:54:25.950
LAURA: But, I mean, as far as other gods go,

3991
02:54:25.950 --> 02:54:27.985
she's a pretty good one.

3992
02:54:27.985 --> 02:54:30.902
TRAVIS: (faint laugh) Okay.

3993
02:54:33.628 --> 02:54:35.328
I'm going to see if she'll...

3994
02:54:37.186 --> 02:54:39.262
take an interest?

3995
02:54:39.262 --> 02:54:40.217
I don't know.

3996
02:54:40.217 --> 02:54:41.633
LAURA: Whoa!

3997
02:54:44.158 --> 02:54:46.029
TRAVIS: I don't know how it works.

3998
02:54:46.029 --> 02:54:47.819
LAURA: I don't either!

3999
02:54:47.819 --> 02:54:50.808
We should figure this out!

4000
02:54:50.808 --> 02:54:52.480
This is our new mission.

4001
02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:53.537
TRAVIS: This is?

4002
02:54:53.537 --> 02:54:55.211
LAURA: Yeah, remember, originally we were just trying

4003
02:54:55.211 --> 02:54:57.067
to get you to that stupid Academy.

4004
02:54:57.067 --> 02:54:59.036
That place is stupid, I hate that place.

4005
02:54:59.036 --> 02:55:02.061
TRAVIS: I don't mind a new mission, but if it is,

4006
02:55:02.061 --> 02:55:05.817
can we just not, you know, tell anybody that--

4007
02:55:05.817 --> 02:55:07.648
LAURA: Okay, we won't tell everybody,

4008
02:55:07.648 --> 02:55:09.856
but you and I will know, this is our new mission.

4009
02:55:09.856 --> 02:55:10.689
TRAVIS: Okay.

4010
02:55:11.822 --> 02:55:13.288
LAURA: And we'll do anything

4011
02:55:13.288 --> 02:55:16.506
to get you away from Uk'otoa, okay?

4012
02:55:16.506 --> 02:55:17.351
TRAVIS: Okay.

4013
02:55:17.351 --> 02:55:20.343
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

4014
02:55:20.343 --> 02:55:23.008
LAURA: Thank you for talking to me, Fjord.

4015
02:55:23.008 --> 02:55:23.841
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4016
02:55:25.070 --> 02:55:28.707
LAURA: Your tusks look pretty good coming in, by the way.

4017
02:55:28.707 --> 02:55:29.990
TRAVIS: (muffled) Thanks.

4018
02:55:31.659 --> 02:55:33.909
MARISHA: (chuckling)

4019
02:55:36.192 --> 02:55:37.408
MATT: All right.

4020
02:55:37.408 --> 02:55:38.552
You guys separate and go off to bed?

4021
02:55:38.552 --> 02:55:39.560
LAURA: Yeah.

4022
02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:40.478
MATT: Okay.

4023
02:55:40.478 --> 02:55:44.662
LIAM: I have a thing, but it depends on if Caleb's

4024
02:55:44.662 --> 02:55:46.682
bedding on his own, or if Caleb and Nott

4025
02:55:46.682 --> 02:55:49.118
are paired up again. I don't know where we're--

4026
02:55:49.118 --> 02:55:51.174
what this place has to offer for sleeping.

4027
02:55:51.174 --> 02:55:54.616
MATT: You guys are, they don't have a lot of rooms,

4028
02:55:54.616 --> 02:55:57.614
so the chamber that you have, and been given for the evening

4029
02:55:57.614 --> 02:56:02.202
is the main chamber where Tyla and her husband,

4030
02:56:02.202 --> 02:56:05.496
who's currently off in Uthodurn, normally stay in,

4031
02:56:05.496 --> 02:56:08.329
so you're all in one central room.

4032
02:56:09.811 --> 02:56:11.387
LIAM: Okay.

4033
02:56:12.545 --> 02:56:15.962
I'm going to go into a corner,

4034
02:56:15.962 --> 02:56:19.478
seeing people doing their own things, and face the corner,

4035
02:56:19.478 --> 02:56:23.311
and put Frumpkin on the ground in front of me.

4036
02:56:25.088 --> 02:56:26.421
Keep me company.

4037
02:56:28.308 --> 02:56:31.703
Then I'm going to spend the next hour

4038
02:56:31.703 --> 02:56:33.875
taking everything-- not my clothes--

4039
02:56:33.875 --> 02:56:37.479
but taking things off, and opening bags,

4040
02:56:37.479 --> 02:56:41.995
and making little, very specific,

4041
02:56:41.995 --> 02:56:44.542
orderly rows of

4042
02:56:44.542 --> 02:56:48.258
a small pouch of iron dust,

4043
02:56:48.258 --> 02:56:50.310
and the honeysuckle,

4044
02:56:50.310 --> 02:56:53.001
and I take that leather thong that I wear around my thigh

4045
02:56:53.001 --> 02:56:58.001
and place that down, and the pearl, and the cat mint,

4046
02:56:58.044 --> 02:57:03.019
and all of my different things, but in very specific rows.

4047
02:57:04.499 --> 02:57:07.188
The glove comes off and I set that down,

4048
02:57:07.188 --> 02:57:12.180
and I unroll a long leather-- just a strip of leather

4049
02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:15.940
so that it's not on the ground, it's laid out on this,

4050
02:57:17.233 --> 02:57:18.874
and everything,

4051
02:57:18.874 --> 02:57:21.599
all my bits and pieces come away,

4052
02:57:21.599 --> 02:57:24.601
except I do rub my hand under the chain

4053
02:57:24.601 --> 02:57:26.426
that has been around my neck for five and a half

4054
02:57:26.426 --> 02:57:29.093
to six years, and I leave that on.

4055
02:57:33.848 --> 02:57:37.189
I take out my spellbook and flip through every page

4056
02:57:37.189 --> 02:57:41.564
and just glance at it for about five seconds each,

4057
02:57:42.437 --> 02:57:44.856
and set that down and leave it closed,

4058
02:57:44.856 --> 02:57:46.837
and then I take out the other book,

4059
02:57:46.837 --> 02:57:50.670
and I write for about 20 minutes in it,

4060
02:57:52.465 --> 02:57:56.882
and then I sit and don't move for five to 10 minutes.

4061
02:58:01.036 --> 02:58:06.036
Then I spend the next 10 to 15 gathering things slowly,

4062
02:58:06.148 --> 02:58:10.006
putting them back, now that I've taken stock.

4063
02:58:10.006 --> 02:58:13.043
Glove back on, everything back in the bag,

4064
02:58:13.043 --> 02:58:18.043
one book, two book, pull the chain a little bit,

4065
02:58:19.509 --> 02:58:22.426
and stare at Frumpkin for a minute.

4066
02:58:24.181 --> 02:58:26.292
MATT: (purrs)

4067
02:58:26.292 --> 02:58:27.590
LIAM: You're a good cat.

4068
02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:28.733
MATT: (mews)

4069
02:58:28.733 --> 02:58:30.200
LIAM: (snaps fingers)
MATT: (poof)

4070
02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:31.523
(laughter)

4071
02:58:31.523 --> 02:58:32.356
MARISHA: Dead.

4072
02:58:32.356 --> 02:58:34.707
(laughter)

4073
02:58:34.707 --> 02:58:36.237
LIAM: I just stare into the corner of the room

4074
02:58:36.237 --> 02:58:40.265
for another three or four minutes,
and I'm going to go to bed.

4075
02:58:40.265 --> 02:58:41.098
MATT: Okay.

4076
02:58:42.844 --> 02:58:45.319
Everyone find themselves to rest?

4077
02:58:45.319 --> 02:58:47.324
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend some time, I'm going to walk

4078
02:58:47.324 --> 02:58:50.657
every hall I can get into, very quietly.

4079
02:58:51.556 --> 02:58:53.276
See everything there is to see,

4080
02:58:53.276 --> 02:58:55.284
touch everything there is to touch, and--

4081
02:58:55.284 --> 02:58:56.878
MATT: You recognize a lot of the iconography

4082
02:58:56.878 --> 02:58:59.508
of Moradin, the Allhammer, but there are

4083
02:58:59.508 --> 02:59:03.986
many strong traces of Melora's presence here,

4084
02:59:03.986 --> 02:59:07.749
as well as elements of the Raven Queen
also woven throughout.

4085
02:59:07.749 --> 02:59:12.449
This is a conjoined quest

4086
02:59:12.449 --> 02:59:13.472
given by

4087
02:59:13.472 --> 02:59:16.692
and tethered through a number of these entities.

4088
02:59:16.692 --> 02:59:19.703
TALIESIN: I'll find my way to bed, finish in the morning.

4089
02:59:19.703 --> 02:59:21.200
MATT: Okay.

4090
02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:22.502
All right.

4091
02:59:22.502 --> 02:59:24.636
You all eventually come to sleep,

4092
02:59:24.636 --> 02:59:27.811
evening of comfort finds you.

4093
02:59:34.916 --> 02:59:36.333
In the dark calm--

4094
02:59:37.201 --> 02:59:38.034
SAM: Oh.

4095
02:59:40.058 --> 02:59:41.664
MATT: --of your evening's sleep, Fjord.

4096
02:59:41.664 --> 02:59:42.894
TRAVIS: No!

4097
02:59:42.894 --> 02:59:45.306
(laughter)

4098
02:59:45.306 --> 02:59:47.617
It's not me, we're talking to everybody, right?

4099
02:59:47.617 --> 02:59:50.050
(laughter)

4100
02:59:50.050 --> 02:59:50.981
LIAM: Ghost Dick.

4101
02:59:50.981 --> 02:59:53.192
SAM: The ghost of Avantika's there for a second.

4102
02:59:53.192 --> 02:59:54.485
MATT: Oh my god.

4103
02:59:54.485 --> 02:59:56.286
(laughter)

4104
02:59:56.286 --> 02:59:58.467
TRAVIS: He hears these things, don't do that.

4105
02:59:58.467 --> 03:00:00.717
LIAM: Don't dump your body down.

4106
03:00:02.468 --> 03:00:06.801
MATT: You wake up on a beach.

4107
03:00:06.801 --> 03:00:08.876
You can hear the waves crashing,

4108
03:00:08.876 --> 03:00:13.312
but it's night, the moon high in the sky, round, full,

4109
03:00:13.312 --> 03:00:17.022
a singular beacon of white light above,

4110
03:00:17.022 --> 03:00:19.875
the stars twinkling above.

4111
03:00:19.875 --> 03:00:21.417
It's peaceful.

4112
03:00:23.076 --> 03:00:25.073
While you're conscious of it,

4113
03:00:25.073 --> 03:00:29.014
and it's familiar, and it's just a dream--

4114
03:00:31.421 --> 03:00:33.364
You watch as the stars begin to blink out.

4115
03:00:33.364 --> 03:00:37.106
(clicking)

4116
03:00:38.548 --> 03:00:41.083
You look up and you can see them twinkling,

4117
03:00:41.083 --> 03:00:43.383
different variations and brightness,

4118
03:00:43.383 --> 03:00:47.216
one by one plucked out of the sky by darkness.

4119
03:00:49.387 --> 03:00:54.387
That full moon, you watch as the dark orb of shadow

4120
03:00:54.491 --> 03:00:58.074
begin to take it from one side to the next.

4121
03:00:59.417 --> 03:01:01.281
The singular source of light left

4122
03:01:01.281 --> 03:01:04.492
beginning to leave you in complete shadow

4123
03:01:04.492 --> 03:01:06.510
as you begin to panic and feel your heart beating

4124
03:01:06.510 --> 03:01:10.437
into your throat, you dig your fingers into the sand,

4125
03:01:10.437 --> 03:01:13.040
your toes in, and stand up, just as

4126
03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:15.873
the last bit of light plucks away.

4127
03:01:16.776 --> 03:01:20.771
What disturbs you is that you're comfortable

4128
03:01:20.771 --> 03:01:24.362
in the dark, but there's no

4129
03:01:24.362 --> 03:01:27.137
placement of sight around you

4130
03:01:27.137 --> 03:01:32.137
than but five feet of the beach and ocean before you.

4131
03:01:32.226 --> 03:01:34.852
You can watch the waves (gentle crash)

4132
03:01:34.852 --> 03:01:37.185
and pull away, out of sight.

4133
03:01:39.722 --> 03:01:44.722
You feel, to the right of you, a heavy (thuds),

4134
03:01:46.289 --> 03:01:49.789
and you feel a spray of sand from one side

4135
03:01:50.952 --> 03:01:52.057
(thudding)

4136
03:01:52.057 --> 03:01:54.660
onto the opposite side.

4137
03:01:54.660 --> 03:01:57.993
Another spray, and you start to back up,

4138
03:01:59.672 --> 03:02:03.922
and as you begin to back away, you feel the tendrils

4139
03:02:04.793 --> 03:02:07.865
catch you from behind, and wrap and curl

4140
03:02:07.865 --> 03:02:12.352
around one shoulder, and around your torso and constrict,

4141
03:02:12.352 --> 03:02:17.335
not to pain, but to the point of immobility.

4142
03:02:19.588 --> 03:02:24.403
Where the moon was in the sky, the shadow pulls back,

4143
03:02:24.403 --> 03:02:28.353
but instead of a white moon, a yellow one.

4144
03:02:28.353 --> 03:02:31.103
As it tears away,

4145
03:02:31.103 --> 03:02:34.602
the singular familiar dark slit

4146
03:02:34.602 --> 03:02:39.435
staring down upon you, pulls you closer towards its light.

4147
03:02:45.972 --> 03:02:49.921
"Don't run.

4148
03:02:54.028 --> 03:02:56.094
"Find.

4149
03:03:00.242 --> 03:03:02.050
"Take.

4150
03:03:05.212 --> 03:03:07.987
"Consume."

4151
03:03:13.384 --> 03:03:16.942
You sense below the eye,

4152
03:03:16.942 --> 03:03:19.215
the sky begins to tear loudly.

4153
03:03:19.215 --> 03:03:21.303
(ripping)

4154
03:03:21.303 --> 03:03:25.691
The streaking thunderous noise as you see a mouth

4155
03:03:25.691 --> 03:03:30.370
pull across the endless abyss and open,

4156
03:03:30.370 --> 03:03:32.850
and the tendrils draw you towards it.

4157
03:03:32.850 --> 03:03:34.353
TRAVIS: Mm-mm.

4158
03:03:34.353 --> 03:03:35.969
MATT: "Return.

4159
03:03:37.104 --> 03:03:41.793
"Or consume.

4160
03:03:41.793 --> 03:03:43.029
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

4161
03:03:43.029 --> 03:03:47.178
MATT: As it pulls you into the dark expanse of the mouth,

4162
03:03:47.178 --> 03:03:50.925
the jaws clamp around you, your body

4163
03:03:50.925 --> 03:03:53.441
suddenly crushed

4164
03:03:53.441 --> 03:03:56.341
with an instant, universal pain

4165
03:03:56.341 --> 03:04:00.240
of your physical form being snuffed into paste,

4166
03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:04.795
and in that minute, (gasping), wake up once more.

4167
03:04:05.861 --> 03:04:07.581
You have no idea what time it is.

4168
03:04:07.581 --> 03:04:09.997
The rest of your companions around you asleep.

4169
03:04:09.997 --> 03:04:14.256
Yourself washed with sweat, breathing heavy.

4170
03:04:17.024 --> 03:04:19.482
TRAVIS: Do I see the sword?

4171
03:04:20.829 --> 03:04:23.104
MATT: You don't see it at the moment.

4172
03:04:24.723 --> 03:04:26.910
TRAVIS: Can I summon it?

4173
03:04:26.910 --> 03:04:27.866
MATT: Nothing.

4174
03:04:27.866 --> 03:04:30.143
(groaning)

4175
03:04:30.143 --> 03:04:32.142
MARISHA: Again?

4176
03:04:32.142 --> 03:04:33.309
TRAVIS: Oh, come on.

4177
03:04:34.443 --> 03:04:37.026
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4178
03:04:38.377 --> 03:04:39.949
Mm-hmm.

4179
03:04:40.899 --> 03:04:41.994
I sit up.

4180
03:04:41.994 --> 03:04:42.827
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4181
03:04:44.038 --> 03:04:46.629
TRAVIS: I start looking for it

4182
03:04:47.746 --> 03:04:49.121
a bit more urgently.

4183
03:04:49.121 --> 03:04:51.435
MATT: You glance over, and about four feet from you,

4184
03:04:51.435 --> 03:04:52.736
it is resting right next to where

4185
03:04:52.736 --> 03:04:55.161
Beauregard is currently curled up.

4186
03:04:58.850 --> 03:05:00.440
TRAVIS: Unsheathed?

4187
03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:01.523
MATT: Unsheathed.

4188
03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:06.565
TRAVIS: I will pick it up, and I will walk

4189
03:05:06.565 --> 03:05:08.731
a little bit away from the group.

4190
03:05:08.731 --> 03:05:11.148
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

4191
03:05:13.122 --> 03:05:14.386
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

4192
03:05:14.386 --> 03:05:16.473
SAM: Whoa.
LIAM: Hmm.

4193
03:05:16.473 --> 03:05:21.343
MATT: Without issue, you gingerly grasp your weapon

4194
03:05:21.343 --> 03:05:24.793
and sneak your way out of the chamber into the hallway.

4195
03:05:26.942 --> 03:05:29.691
TRAVIS: I will look at the sword.

4196
03:05:29.691 --> 03:05:32.184
MATT: You can see the dull orange glow that emanates

4197
03:05:32.184 --> 03:05:35.297
from the not too distant Underforge,

4198
03:05:35.297 --> 03:05:37.609
and the magma pool beneath it,

4199
03:05:37.609 --> 03:05:40.861
slightly lighting the outside of your face

4200
03:05:40.861 --> 03:05:43.035
against the reflective blade.

4201
03:05:43.035 --> 03:05:44.985
TRAVIS: Yeah, yes.

4202
03:05:45.876 --> 03:05:49.039
I will walk towards the pool of magma.

4203
03:05:49.039 --> 03:05:50.904
As close as I can get.

4204
03:05:50.904 --> 03:05:53.427
MATT: Okay, you step out, and you can see

4205
03:05:53.427 --> 03:05:57.838
sitting in the same chair where you first met Jeramess Dust,

4206
03:05:57.838 --> 03:06:01.957
she is sat there slumped forward and asleep,

4207
03:06:01.957 --> 03:06:05.288
shoulder placed against the small table to her side,

4208
03:06:05.288 --> 03:06:08.597
where the whittling tools are, unaware of your presence.

4209
03:06:11.179 --> 03:06:14.696
TRAVIS: I will take the sword

4210
03:06:14.696 --> 03:06:18.195
and hold it against my chest,

4211
03:06:18.195 --> 03:06:20.011
and I will say:

4212
03:06:21.111 --> 03:06:26.094
You need me more than I need you.

4213
03:06:32.532 --> 03:06:34.240
Give it back.

4214
03:06:35.685 --> 03:06:37.435
Does anything happen?

4215
03:06:39.439 --> 03:06:41.856
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

4216
03:06:43.688 --> 03:06:44.885
LIAM: Against a titan.

4217
03:06:44.885 --> 03:06:46.018
MARISHA: Yeah.

4218
03:06:47.937 --> 03:06:48.982
TRAVIS: 23.

4219
03:06:48.982 --> 03:06:49.815
SAM: Ooh.

4220
03:06:50.798 --> 03:06:52.795
Charisma.

4221
03:06:52.795 --> 03:06:55.954
MATT: Nothing seems to happen.

4222
03:06:57.946 --> 03:06:59.646
TRAVIS: I push it into my chest.

4223
03:06:59.646 --> 03:07:01.065
SAM: Ooh!

4224
03:07:01.065 --> 03:07:02.864
MATT: How far in?

4225
03:07:02.864 --> 03:07:05.914
TRAVIS: A few inches, maybe an inch.

4226
03:07:05.914 --> 03:07:08.381
MATT: Okay, a few inches or-- it's a little different.

4227
03:07:08.381 --> 03:07:10.331
TRAVIS: No, let's say an inch, see what happens.

4228
03:07:10.331 --> 03:07:12.790
MATT: The pain rocks through your body,

4229
03:07:13.887 --> 03:07:17.413
and as you press in, your muscles tense around it,

4230
03:07:17.413 --> 03:07:21.811
your chest contracts, and you feel the white hot sharp pain

4231
03:07:21.811 --> 03:07:24.327
up through your body and into the base of your skull.

4232
03:07:24.327 --> 03:07:26.178
You press it in, you can already feel the blood

4233
03:07:26.178 --> 03:07:28.165
beginning to trickle from the wound.

4234
03:07:28.165 --> 03:07:30.258
TRAVIS: I'll take one step towards the pool of magma

4235
03:07:30.258 --> 03:07:31.664
and I'll push it in a little further.

4236
03:07:31.664 --> 03:07:33.439
SAM: Oh!

4237
03:07:35.837 --> 03:07:37.037
MATT: Okay.

4238
03:07:38.061 --> 03:07:41.327
You push it in another inch or so.

4239
03:07:41.327 --> 03:07:42.160
You--

4240
03:07:47.544 --> 03:07:51.448
You've taken nine points of-- I'll say for this

4241
03:07:51.448 --> 03:07:53.221
piercing damage, even though it is a slashing weapon,

4242
03:07:53.221 --> 03:07:55.372
but it's being utilized in a piercing fashion.

4243
03:07:55.372 --> 03:07:56.747
TALIESIN: DPB.

4244
03:07:59.087 --> 03:08:01.136
MATT: As you now step--

4245
03:08:01.136 --> 03:08:03.838
LAURA: How close are you to the lava?

4246
03:08:03.838 --> 03:08:06.262
MATT: You're now like maybe a foot from the edge of it.

4247
03:08:06.262 --> 03:08:07.378
SAM: Oh god.

4248
03:08:07.378 --> 03:08:11.618
TRAVIS: Probably almost taking damage from that.

4249
03:08:11.618 --> 03:08:14.705
MATT: Make another intimidation check, if you'd like.

4250
03:08:14.705 --> 03:08:16.663
LAURA: Oh god.
SAM: Oh boy.

4251
03:08:19.088 --> 03:08:20.514
TRAVIS: (groans)

4252
03:08:20.514 --> 03:08:22.181
13.
MATT: 13.

4253
03:08:22.181 --> 03:08:23.779
No response.

4254
03:08:23.779 --> 03:08:27.789
No reaction, the heat is burning onto the edge of your skin.

4255
03:08:27.789 --> 03:08:29.872
Not painfully so, but you definitely

4256
03:08:29.872 --> 03:08:31.819
can feel the proximity.

4257
03:08:31.819 --> 03:08:33.986
TRAVIS: One more step, one more push.

4258
03:08:33.986 --> 03:08:36.281
MATT: You are now at the edge of it.

4259
03:08:36.281 --> 03:08:37.645
TRAVIS: (grunts)

4260
03:08:37.645 --> 03:08:39.290
MATT: You push in further, okay.

4261
03:08:39.290 --> 03:08:41.284
TALIESIN: Oh, Jesus.

4262
03:08:41.284 --> 03:08:45.574
LAURA: Don't pass out next to the lava, please.

4263
03:08:45.574 --> 03:08:47.468
MATT: Okay, that's--

4264
03:08:47.468 --> 03:08:49.858
LIAM: ♪ Whatever Uk'otoa wants ♪

4265
03:08:49.858 --> 03:08:53.877
MATT: 19 points of piercing damage upon yourself.

4266
03:08:53.877 --> 03:08:56.246
At this point, as you're pulling it there--

4267
03:08:56.246 --> 03:08:57.784
how close are you standing to the edge?

4268
03:08:57.784 --> 03:09:00.319
Are you just like outside of the wall or up against it?
TRAVIS: Just outside of it.

4269
03:09:00.319 --> 03:09:01.823
MATT: All right, you're standing right there,

4270
03:09:01.823 --> 03:09:04.259
it's plunged now its third inch in,

4271
03:09:04.259 --> 03:09:07.547
and that's fairly deep into your chest,

4272
03:09:07.547 --> 03:09:10.486
and you can already feel the worry.

4273
03:09:10.486 --> 03:09:14.548
Amongst-- your willpower is there at the moment,

4274
03:09:14.548 --> 03:09:15.992
in the back of your mind, you're like,

4275
03:09:15.992 --> 03:09:17.949
"I'm getting close to vitals."

4276
03:09:17.949 --> 03:09:19.307
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

4277
03:09:19.307 --> 03:09:21.764
MATT: Make another intimidation check.

4278
03:09:21.764 --> 03:09:23.064
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4279
03:09:25.466 --> 03:09:26.414
TRAVIS: 22.

4280
03:09:26.414 --> 03:09:28.239
MATT: 22, no response.

4281
03:09:30.324 --> 03:09:33.666
TRAVIS: I take the sword out, hold it over the pool.

4282
03:09:33.666 --> 03:09:37.089
MATT: All right, you withdraw. And with that, there's a gout

4283
03:09:37.089 --> 03:09:41.264
of your own viscera splatters across the exterior

4284
03:09:41.264 --> 03:09:43.914
of the wall, and begins to immediately

4285
03:09:43.914 --> 03:09:45.123
sizzle and smoke.

4286
03:09:45.123 --> 03:09:49.098
TRAVIS: I don't know how long I can hold this.

4287
03:09:50.992 --> 03:09:54.806
MATT: As the blood drips from the blade (hissing)

4288
03:09:54.806 --> 03:09:59.806
into the magma, the steam and smoke that arises

4289
03:09:59.885 --> 03:10:03.420
from the burning of your own blood across the immediate,

4290
03:10:03.420 --> 03:10:06.080
extremely hot surface, (hissing)

4291
03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:08.080
sends up tufts of smoke.

4292
03:10:10.154 --> 03:10:12.581
The stream gets more consistent

4293
03:10:12.581 --> 03:10:15.834
as the smoke billows more and more and more,

4294
03:10:15.834 --> 03:10:19.264
and begins to fill the space around you.

4295
03:10:19.264 --> 03:10:22.099
The dark smoke beginning to swirl around your shoulders

4296
03:10:22.099 --> 03:10:23.849
and around the weapon until suddenly

4297
03:10:23.849 --> 03:10:26.032
the light begins to be choked around you,

4298
03:10:26.032 --> 03:10:29.499
the warm, bright underglow of the light and fire

4299
03:10:29.499 --> 03:10:31.963
begins to vanish as you find yourself

4300
03:10:31.963 --> 03:10:34.527
surrounded in this cloud of smoke

4301
03:10:34.527 --> 03:10:37.041
borne from your own burning blood.

4302
03:10:37.041 --> 03:10:39.519
In that moment, the pain still there

4303
03:10:39.519 --> 03:10:42.436
throbbing in your chest,

4304
03:10:42.436 --> 03:10:44.611
numbs ever so slightly.

4305
03:10:47.148 --> 03:10:49.762
There in the smoke around the blade,

4306
03:10:49.762 --> 03:10:53.512
your hand shaking, still stalwart and strong,

4307
03:10:55.778 --> 03:10:58.111
a calmness comes across you.

4308
03:11:05.057 --> 03:11:06.607
What do you do?

4309
03:11:10.563 --> 03:11:12.438
LAURA: (whispering) Is it the Wildmother?

4310
03:11:15.641 --> 03:11:17.882
TRAVIS: I pull the blade back,

4311
03:11:20.441 --> 03:11:22.459
and throw it.

4312
03:11:22.459 --> 03:11:24.207
SAM: Into the...

4313
03:11:24.207 --> 03:11:26.896
LAURA: (gasps)

4314
03:11:26.896 --> 03:11:29.463
MATT: It disappears through the smoke.

4315
03:11:32.307 --> 03:11:35.390
You hear-- (clanking)

4316
03:11:38.534 --> 03:11:41.361
The smoke dissipates in the direction

4317
03:11:41.361 --> 03:11:44.459
of where you threw it about a moment later.

4318
03:11:44.459 --> 03:11:48.575
There you can see it resting and slowly-- (hissing)

4319
03:11:48.575 --> 03:11:49.556
SAM and LAURA: (gasping)

4320
03:11:49.556 --> 03:11:54.532
MATT: -- sinking into the molten rock.

4321
03:11:58.777 --> 03:12:01.394
TRAVIS: I'll take a step back.

4322
03:12:05.445 --> 03:12:08.183
Does it disappear under the--

4323
03:12:08.183 --> 03:12:12.016
MATT: If you wait a few moments, it probably will.

4324
03:12:13.410 --> 03:12:15.301
TRAVIS: I'll put my hand over the wound.

4325
03:12:15.301 --> 03:12:17.409
Is it still pouring?

4326
03:12:19.486 --> 03:12:23.204
MATT: It is still bleeding, but not as profusely as it was

4327
03:12:23.204 --> 03:12:25.537
when you withdrew the blade.

4328
03:12:28.931 --> 03:12:33.906
TRAVIS: I'll wander over to the group and wake up Caduceus.

4329
03:12:34.851 --> 03:12:36.146
MATT: Okay.

4330
03:12:36.146 --> 03:12:39.737
Caduceus, you come to consciousness being gently--

4331
03:12:39.737 --> 03:12:43.278
somewhat gently woken by Fjord,

4332
03:12:43.278 --> 03:12:46.676
who's currently clutching what is very easy to see,

4333
03:12:46.676 --> 03:12:51.030
an open wound in the chest and a very bloodied hand over it.

4334
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:52.412
TRAVIS: (British accent) I need your help.

4335
03:12:52.412 --> 03:12:55.371
TALIESIN: Don't even-- yeah.

4336
03:12:55.371 --> 03:12:58.312
I'm not even going to-- just--

4337
03:12:59.287 --> 03:13:01.487
I'm going to put a hand on and heal that

4338
03:13:01.487 --> 03:13:04.309
right now, I'm not even going to ask.

4339
03:13:06.265 --> 03:13:08.598
Let's do that at--

4340
03:13:09.606 --> 03:13:13.473
let's do a Cure Wounds at like a--

4341
03:13:13.473 --> 03:13:16.487
you really effed yourself up, didn't you?

4342
03:13:16.487 --> 03:13:19.483
Let's just do level four Cure Wounds to say we did

4343
03:13:19.483 --> 03:13:21.404
and let's just get this out of the way.

4344
03:13:21.404 --> 03:13:23.312
MATT: Okay.

4345
03:13:27.211 --> 03:13:28.044
TALIESIN: 11.

4346
03:13:30.399 --> 03:13:35.366
17, 18, 19, 24 hit points back immediately, just boom.

4347
03:13:38.965 --> 03:13:40.637
TRAVIS: Thank you.

4348
03:13:40.637 --> 03:13:42.054
TALIESIN: Do you want to--

4349
03:13:43.546 --> 03:13:45.709
TRAVIS: I need to sit down.

4350
03:13:45.709 --> 03:13:48.685
TALIESIN: Why don't we-- I'm going to pick him up

4351
03:13:48.685 --> 03:13:50.606
and I'm going to take him out of the room

4352
03:13:50.606 --> 03:13:52.161
with all the sleeping people.

4353
03:13:52.161 --> 03:13:53.390
MATT: Okay.

4354
03:13:53.390 --> 03:13:57.184
TALIESIN: To whatever passes for fresh air.

4355
03:13:57.184 --> 03:13:59.170
MATT: Fresh air would be, it's--

4356
03:13:59.170 --> 03:14:00.578
TALIESIN: It's a bit of a ways.

4357
03:14:00.578 --> 03:14:02.969
MATT: Well, you'd have to probably get close to the exit,

4358
03:14:02.969 --> 03:14:04.941
but there's the smoke above.

4359
03:14:04.941 --> 03:14:05.943
TALIESIN: Fresher air.

4360
03:14:05.943 --> 03:14:08.201
MATT: One of the side chambers, or

4361
03:14:08.201 --> 03:14:10.410
on the floor around the Underforge.

4362
03:14:10.410 --> 03:14:14.593
TALIESIN: Whatever's private and emotionally healing.

4363
03:14:14.593 --> 03:14:15.885
MATT: Okay, you find one of those small storage chambers

4364
03:14:15.885 --> 03:14:17.218
off to the side.

4365
03:14:18.556 --> 03:14:20.723
TALIESIN: So, um--

4366
03:14:23.256 --> 03:14:25.247
How did that happen?

4367
03:14:28.294 --> 03:14:31.427
TRAVIS: I threw the sword into the liquid rock.

4368
03:14:33.937 --> 03:14:36.714
TALIESIN: Your sword.

4369
03:14:36.714 --> 03:14:37.547
TRAVIS: Yes.

4370
03:14:39.651 --> 03:14:40.742
TALIESIN: Why?

4371
03:14:45.261 --> 03:14:47.844
TRAVIS: I don't like being a hostage.

4372
03:14:50.628 --> 03:14:52.128
TALIESIN: How do you feel?

4373
03:14:54.810 --> 03:14:56.810
TRAVIS: I honestly don't know.

4374
03:14:58.577 --> 03:15:02.860
That sword was all I had.

4375
03:15:05.381 --> 03:15:09.347
TALIESIN: Well, I assure you that's not true.

4376
03:15:16.439 --> 03:15:19.867
God, I haven't regained my spells yet.

4377
03:15:19.867 --> 03:15:21.624
So what am I going to do?

4378
03:15:21.624 --> 03:15:23.124
I would like to--

4379
03:15:28.279 --> 03:15:29.646
TRAVIS: Thank you.

4380
03:15:30.773 --> 03:15:32.637
TALIESIN: For what?

4381
03:15:32.637 --> 03:15:35.019
I'm at a loss, I don't--

4382
03:15:35.019 --> 03:15:40.019
TRAVIS: Just for being you and coming from where you have

4383
03:15:40.152 --> 03:15:42.444
and sharing what you know.

4384
03:15:44.430 --> 03:15:46.580
I'm inspired by you.

4385
03:15:55.412 --> 03:15:57.480
TALIESIN: For what it's worth, those words alone

4386
03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:00.394
make me feel like leaving my home

4387
03:16:00.394 --> 03:16:04.393
and going on this journey was entirely worthwhile.

4388
03:16:04.393 --> 03:16:09.335
I think I've said it before,

4389
03:16:10.784 --> 03:16:13.434
I think there are great things ahead of you.

4390
03:16:14.887 --> 03:16:16.904
I can't imagine--

4391
03:16:18.114 --> 03:16:22.580
You threw your sword-- show me where.

4392
03:16:24.095 --> 03:16:26.179
TRAVIS: In the pool.

4393
03:16:28.043 --> 03:16:29.313
TALIESIN: (exhales)

4394
03:16:29.313 --> 03:16:30.389
TRAVIS: I could show you.

4395
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:31.723
TALIESIN: Please.

4396
03:16:31.723 --> 03:16:33.625
TRAVIS: I'll take him over to where it was.

4397
03:16:33.625 --> 03:16:36.664
MATT: Okay. It's no longer there.

4398
03:16:36.664 --> 03:16:40.060
Your perceptive glance, you do see--

4399
03:16:40.060 --> 03:16:41.431
TALIESIN: It would leave a--

4400
03:16:41.431 --> 03:16:43.931
MATT: You do see what looked to be

4401
03:16:46.760 --> 03:16:49.343
maybe elements of melted metal.

4402
03:16:50.224 --> 03:16:52.557
TALIESIN: I'm going to do Detect Magic.

4403
03:16:54.510 --> 03:16:57.589
Just to see if it's even, if there's a glimmer of it.

4404
03:16:57.589 --> 03:16:58.841
MATT: All right.

4405
03:16:58.841 --> 03:17:00.231
The direction of the weapon, no.

4406
03:17:00.231 --> 03:17:04.195
The anvil that sits atop the Underforge is quite magical,

4407
03:17:04.195 --> 03:17:05.858
as well as a number of the implements

4408
03:17:05.858 --> 03:17:07.340
that dangle from the chains around it.

4409
03:17:07.340 --> 03:17:10.706
But from the direction of where this weapon was thrown, no.

4410
03:17:11.898 --> 03:17:15.023
TALIESIN: Magical weapon wouldn't melt.

4411
03:17:16.293 --> 03:17:18.402
MATT: It shouldn't.
TALIESIN: So.

4412
03:17:24.178 --> 03:17:26.428
I think you've made a good first step.

4413
03:17:27.315 --> 03:17:29.592
I don't think you've--

4414
03:17:29.592 --> 03:17:32.309
I don't think you're free yet.

4415
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:34.398
TRAVIS: (scoffs)

4416
03:17:34.398 --> 03:17:37.637
What do you mean? It's--

4417
03:17:37.637 --> 03:17:40.245
It's in the liquid rock, nothing could--

4418
03:17:41.320 --> 03:17:42.794
What do you mean?

4419
03:17:43.991 --> 03:17:47.516
TALIESIN: Meaning this creature,

4420
03:17:47.516 --> 03:17:52.516
this thing that has a hold on you,

4421
03:17:52.675 --> 03:17:55.133
this thing that's gotten into you.

4422
03:17:56.721 --> 03:18:01.138
You describe it as, I don't know, something

4423
03:18:02.268 --> 03:18:04.051
deep sea, something

4424
03:18:06.535 --> 03:18:09.521
like a squid-like eye?

4425
03:18:09.521 --> 03:18:14.496
TRAVIS: Many eyes, one giant eye, but more like a serpent.

4426
03:18:17.701 --> 03:18:20.226
It's always in darkness.

4427
03:18:23.149 --> 03:18:24.873
TALIESIN: I'll say you did a good--

4428
03:18:27.107 --> 03:18:29.649
I can't imagine the battle you won tonight.

4429
03:18:31.637 --> 03:18:34.795
Unlatching yourself from one

4430
03:18:35.711 --> 03:18:37.986
tentacled grip of this thing,

4431
03:18:37.986 --> 03:18:40.948
whatever this thing is that you're fighting.

4432
03:18:40.948 --> 03:18:42.181
TRAVIS: Caduceus,

4433
03:18:43.272 --> 03:18:46.351
I may be a liability now.

4434
03:18:46.351 --> 03:18:48.645
TALIESIN: I entirely disagree.

4435
03:18:48.645 --> 03:18:50.028
I think you're

4436
03:18:51.553 --> 03:18:53.773
quite the asset.

4437
03:18:53.773 --> 03:18:56.538
I think we're going to need you.

4438
03:18:56.538 --> 03:18:58.751
I think if you were a liability, this thing wouldn't be

4439
03:18:58.751 --> 03:19:01.211
fighting so hard to keep you.

4440
03:19:01.211 --> 03:19:03.211
I think you're valuable,

4441
03:19:04.837 --> 03:19:09.420
and I think that there are powers at play that know it.

4442
03:19:10.362 --> 03:19:13.140
TRAVIS: Well, let's hope we have an extra sword

4443
03:19:13.140 --> 03:19:14.848
in the back somewhere, yes?

4444
03:19:14.848 --> 03:19:16.944
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have one soon.

4445
03:19:16.944 --> 03:19:19.609
TRAVIS: (sighs)

4446
03:19:19.609 --> 03:19:20.517
TALIESIN: In the meantime,

4447
03:19:20.517 --> 03:19:23.742
we'll give you something to make due with.

4448
03:19:23.742 --> 03:19:25.727
And again, if this thing--

4449
03:19:26.944 --> 03:19:29.694
I've never met a creature with one tentacle.

4450
03:19:31.873 --> 03:19:34.123
LAURA: (laughing)

4451
03:19:35.983 --> 03:19:37.258
TRAVIS: Thank you.

4452
03:19:37.258 --> 03:19:39.941
I'll go wander over and try to--

4453
03:19:41.675 --> 03:19:43.366
try to sleep.

4454
03:19:43.366 --> 03:19:46.569
MATT: Okay. As you wander past the Underforge

4455
03:19:46.569 --> 03:19:50.339
and glancing in the direction of where the sword was thrown,

4456
03:19:50.339 --> 03:19:51.685
you look up towards the anvil,

4457
03:19:51.685 --> 03:19:54.852
and there on the front cusp of it, you can see

4458
03:19:56.708 --> 03:20:00.089
chiseled into the metal, a wreath

4459
03:20:00.089 --> 03:20:04.005
of grain and branch and berry,

4460
03:20:04.005 --> 03:20:05.680
and across the back of it,

4461
03:20:05.680 --> 03:20:10.404
a tall crook placed behind it.

4462
03:20:11.682 --> 03:20:14.240
Something about it just kind of--

4463
03:20:16.340 --> 03:20:19.039
just draws your attention.

4464
03:20:22.927 --> 03:20:23.927
TRAVIS: All right.

4465
03:20:26.524 --> 03:20:29.194
TALIESIN: You're not finished with this fight yet, Fjord.

4466
03:20:29.194 --> 03:20:30.027
I think--

4467
03:20:31.302 --> 03:20:32.852
I think we're going to--

4468
03:20:33.868 --> 03:20:36.951
I think you're going to find your way to the light, though.

4469
03:20:38.277 --> 03:20:40.315
I'm glad you can see it.

4470
03:20:40.315 --> 03:20:43.148
It means you're close to the exit.

4471
03:20:44.113 --> 03:20:46.200
TRAVIS: We'll see where the exit leads.

4472
03:20:46.200 --> 03:20:47.844
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4473
03:20:47.844 --> 03:20:50.254
Let's get some sleep, we've got a journey

4474
03:20:50.254 --> 03:20:53.098
to find you a sword tomorrow.

4475
03:20:53.098 --> 03:20:53.939
TRAVIS: Sure.

4476
03:20:55.409 --> 03:20:57.283
TALIESIN: Night, Fjord.

4477
03:20:57.283 --> 03:20:58.366
TRAVIS: Good night.

4478
03:20:59.604 --> 03:21:00.687
LAURA: Was the thing on the anvil,

4479
03:21:00.687 --> 03:21:02.608
was that etched into the anvil, the crook thing?

4480
03:21:02.608 --> 03:21:03.857
MATT: Etched into it, yeah.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

4481
03:21:03.857 --> 03:21:06.765
LAURA: That's cool, that's cool, that's cool.

4482
03:21:06.765 --> 03:21:08.289
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4483
03:21:08.289 --> 03:21:09.764
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

4484
03:21:12.418 --> 03:21:14.091
TRAVIS: What did I do?

4485
03:21:14.091 --> 03:21:15.750
LIAM: Something real cool.

4486
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:17.558
MARISHA: That was fucking dope.

4487
03:21:17.558 --> 03:21:20.899
TALIESIN: Something Percy never pulled off, motherfucker.

4488
03:21:20.899 --> 03:21:22.416
LAURA: (laughing)

4489
03:21:22.416 --> 03:21:25.872
TALIESIN: You just out-Percyed Percy, well done.

4490
03:21:25.872 --> 03:21:27.397
TRAVIS: Yep.

4491
03:21:28.623 --> 03:21:31.966
MATT: You eventually-- you curl up in the corner,

4492
03:21:31.966 --> 03:21:34.616
the exhaustion not overtaken by the

4493
03:21:35.974 --> 03:21:40.540
immensity and worry of what has transpired,

4494
03:21:40.540 --> 03:21:43.373
but eventually, you do find rest.

4495
03:21:44.778 --> 03:21:46.248
<i>You</i> find very comfortable rest.

4496
03:21:46.248 --> 03:21:48.551
TALIESIN: Man.
(laughs)

4497
03:21:48.551 --> 03:21:50.556
MARISHA: Does this unmake you a warlock?

4498
03:21:50.556 --> 03:21:52.084
MATT: The morning comes.

4499
03:21:52.084 --> 03:21:54.263
SAM: Okay, a long rest.

4500
03:21:54.263 --> 03:21:56.713
MARISHA: Are you Wildlock now?

4501
03:21:57.571 --> 03:22:00.299
MATT: You all come to consciousness in the chamber.

4502
03:22:00.299 --> 03:22:04.135
The warm, dull glow of the forge greets you

4503
03:22:04.135 --> 03:22:05.909
at whatever hour it may be.

4504
03:22:05.909 --> 03:22:09.235
You would be the only one that has any idea.

4505
03:22:09.235 --> 03:22:13.414
Since rest probably, you guys probably bedded down

4506
03:22:13.414 --> 03:22:17.589
closer to midnight, so it's like 8:00, 9:00 in the morning.

4507
03:22:20.248 --> 03:22:21.406
SAM: Woo!

4508
03:22:22.884 --> 03:22:24.634
What's for breakfast?

4509
03:22:26.086 --> 03:22:28.384
TALIESIN: I honestly don't know what we eat around here,

4510
03:22:28.384 --> 03:22:30.936
but I'm happy to help cook, if that helps.

4511
03:22:32.636 --> 03:22:34.394
LAURA: What a night, huh?

4512
03:22:34.394 --> 03:22:35.627
SAM: Good sleep.

4513
03:22:35.627 --> 03:22:37.794
LAURA: Yeah, I got some pretty good rest, yeah.

4514
03:22:37.794 --> 03:22:38.916
SAM: Yeah, it was great.

4515
03:22:38.916 --> 03:22:40.608
TALIESIN: Best sleep in ages.

4516
03:22:42.484 --> 03:22:44.902
SAM: Well, what are we doing today?

4517
03:22:44.902 --> 03:22:46.675
TALIESIN: I think we're making our way.

4518
03:22:46.675 --> 03:22:48.152
LAURA: Downtown?
SAM: Downtown?

4519
03:22:48.152 --> 03:22:51.052
MARISHA: (singing "A Thousand Miles")

4520
03:22:51.960 --> 03:22:55.565
TALIESIN: I'd like to make sure that the records show

4521
03:22:55.565 --> 03:23:00.448
that we were here, and where they can find us,

4522
03:23:01.581 --> 03:23:03.871
to find the tree, to go find the house,

4523
03:23:03.871 --> 03:23:06.839
if any other members of the Clay family

4524
03:23:06.839 --> 03:23:08.267
wander their way up there.

4525
03:23:08.267 --> 03:23:10.295
MATT: All right. Tyla gladly accepts it.

4526
03:23:10.295 --> 03:23:13.845
"Don't worry, I'll go ahead and make sure in our books here

4527
03:23:13.845 --> 03:23:15.102
"this is taken care of."

4528
03:23:15.102 --> 03:23:16.285
TALIESIN: Of course, if you ever need anything,

4529
03:23:16.285 --> 03:23:17.118
you're welcome.

4530
03:23:17.118 --> 03:23:21.078
If for some reason you find you have to leave this place.

4531
03:23:21.078 --> 03:23:24.068
I think we're going to be returning rather soon, anyway.

4532
03:23:24.068 --> 03:23:24.959
MATT: "Well great, look forward

4533
03:23:24.959 --> 03:23:26.342
to seeing you come back, then."

4534
03:23:26.342 --> 03:23:29.544
LAURA: Do you guys have any breakfast stuff here?

4535
03:23:29.544 --> 03:23:32.573
MATT: "We can probably muster something, right?"

4536
03:23:32.573 --> 03:23:36.915
Looks back towards Khemdal, you can see has stretched racks,

4537
03:23:36.915 --> 03:23:40.349
like this metal rack set, where it looks like squirrels

4538
03:23:40.349 --> 03:23:42.424
and other woodland critters have been skinned

4539
03:23:42.424 --> 03:23:44.524
and stretched across it, and is currently holding it

4540
03:23:44.524 --> 03:23:47.135
over the forge, like just burning it.

4541
03:23:47.135 --> 03:23:50.448
"I mean, right, if you're hungry, I can put a few on."

4542
03:23:50.448 --> 03:23:51.293
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

4543
03:23:51.293 --> 03:23:53.987
LAURA: I mean, do you have any like, pastries or anything?

4544
03:23:55.471 --> 03:23:56.534
MATT: "No."

4545
03:23:56.534 --> 03:23:58.945
LIAM: Would you like a bead of nourishment?

4546
03:23:58.945 --> 03:24:00.011
SAM: A bead?

4547
03:24:00.011 --> 03:24:01.069
TALIESIN: Wait.

4548
03:24:01.069 --> 03:24:02.881
LAURA: Ooh. How big is the bead?

4549
03:24:02.881 --> 03:24:03.806
LIAM: It's the size of a boba.

4550
03:24:03.806 --> 03:24:05.147
TALIESIN: No, I don't have enough, damn.

4551
03:24:05.147 --> 03:24:06.197
SAM: A boba bead.

4552
03:24:06.197 --> 03:24:08.031
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

4553
03:24:08.031 --> 03:24:09.250
SAM: Astronaut food.

4554
03:24:09.250 --> 03:24:10.790
LIAM: That's enough for a day, though,

4555
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:11.632
so if you eat the whole thing--

4556
03:24:11.632 --> 03:24:14.532
LAURA: I'll take a nibble.
LIAM: Skip lu-- okay.

4557
03:24:14.532 --> 03:24:16.636
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't have enough supplies

4558
03:24:16.636 --> 03:24:18.661
to bake right now, do I?

4559
03:24:18.661 --> 03:24:19.494
MATT: No.

4560
03:24:19.494 --> 03:24:22.722
TALIESIN: Okay, because holy pizza could be amazing.

4561
03:24:22.722 --> 03:24:24.304
I think I'm going to have to get some baking supplies.

4562
03:24:24.304 --> 03:24:25.413
MATT: You could definitely try that.

4563
03:24:25.413 --> 03:24:26.246
TALIESIN: A kiln?

4564
03:24:26.246 --> 03:24:27.856
MATT: (laughing)

4565
03:24:27.856 --> 03:24:29.094
TALIESIN: I mean.

4566
03:24:29.094 --> 03:24:30.744
MARISHA: It's true. You could make like those little--

4567
03:24:30.744 --> 03:24:32.446
TALIESIN: Bread of the goddess.

4568
03:24:32.446 --> 03:24:34.445
MARISHA: Yeah, like the ground ovens.

4569
03:24:34.445 --> 03:24:35.528
LIAM: It's very light sweet.

4570
03:24:35.528 --> 03:24:36.886
MARISHA: It'd be sick.
LIAM: Almost nothing.

4571
03:24:36.886 --> 03:24:38.273
SAM: I'll have some squirrel bacon.

4572
03:24:38.273 --> 03:24:40.127
TALIESIN: It technically would be a Clay oven.

4573
03:24:40.127 --> 03:24:41.738
MARISHA: It would be a Clay oven!

4574
03:24:41.738 --> 03:24:45.011
LAURA: Fjord, do you want some of my bead?

4575
03:24:45.011 --> 03:24:47.203
TRAVIS: (British accent) Yes, please.

4576
03:24:48.858 --> 03:24:50.419
TALIESIN: I'll have a bit of that too, if you don't mind.

4577
03:24:50.419 --> 03:24:52.491
MARISHA: Can I take one of those skewers to go?

4578
03:24:52.491 --> 03:24:54.624
LAURA: Going to pass the bead around.

4579
03:24:54.624 --> 03:24:55.582
Fjord?

4580
03:24:55.582 --> 03:24:59.156
SAM: Do you have something caught in your throat, Fjord?

4581
03:24:59.156 --> 03:25:01.809
Something's-- like a little bubble.

4582
03:25:01.809 --> 03:25:03.241
LAURA: (whispering) Fjord, Fjord.

4583
03:25:03.241 --> 03:25:05.290
You're not doing the accent.

4584
03:25:05.290 --> 03:25:06.324
You forgot.

4585
03:25:06.324 --> 03:25:07.666
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

4586
03:25:10.619 --> 03:25:12.421
I'm sorry.

4587
03:25:12.421 --> 03:25:13.621
MARISHA: Are you trying to convince somebody

4588
03:25:13.621 --> 03:25:14.846
of something again?

4589
03:25:14.846 --> 03:25:17.179
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to all of you.

4590
03:25:18.737 --> 03:25:23.071
You caught on, and you've known me the longest.

4591
03:25:23.940 --> 03:25:28.065
I haven't been entirely forthright with you.

4592
03:25:32.380 --> 03:25:34.156
I sound like this.

4593
03:25:34.156 --> 03:25:35.516
LAURA: Well yeah, I know.

4594
03:25:35.516 --> 03:25:37.589
TRAVIS: I know you know.
SAM: What do you mean?

4595
03:25:37.589 --> 03:25:39.616
Sometimes, all the time, really?

4596
03:25:39.616 --> 03:25:42.554
TRAVIS: Most of my life, yes, like this.

4597
03:25:42.554 --> 03:25:45.102
SAM: What was that other thing you were doing?

4598
03:25:45.102 --> 03:25:46.606
LAURA: He was Vandran.

4599
03:25:46.606 --> 03:25:48.883
SAM: What do you mean he was Vandran?

4600
03:25:48.883 --> 03:25:52.388
TRAVIS: My captain, Vandran, was a man of great renown

4601
03:25:52.388 --> 03:25:56.682
and respect, and I wanted to emulate him,

4602
03:25:56.682 --> 03:25:58.940
I wanted to <i>be him</i>.

4603
03:25:58.940 --> 03:26:01.793
SAM: So you were talking <i>like</i> him.

4604
03:26:01.793 --> 03:26:02.626
TRAVIS: Yes.

4605
03:26:05.088 --> 03:26:07.243
TALIESIN: Well I liked it, I thought it was fun.

4606
03:26:07.243 --> 03:26:09.211
LAURA: It was charming.

4607
03:26:09.211 --> 03:26:13.628
TRAVIS: I had a night, Caduceus will tell you.

4608
03:26:13.628 --> 03:26:18.045
Had another dream, Nott, I'm sure you'll be thrilled.

4609
03:26:19.384 --> 03:26:23.125
I am sword-less today.

4610
03:26:24.757 --> 03:26:27.449
LAURA: Oh, you can't summon it or something?

4611
03:26:27.449 --> 03:26:30.794
TRAVIS: No, and I'll try and summon it.

4612
03:26:30.794 --> 03:26:32.325
MATT: Nothing happens.

4613
03:26:32.325 --> 03:26:33.725
TRAVIS: I, um--

4614
03:26:35.416 --> 03:26:38.400
I threw the sword into the liquid steel last night.

4615
03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:39.495
SAM: Why?

4616
03:26:39.495 --> 03:26:42.946
LIAM: It was Vandran's sword, wasn't it?

4617
03:26:42.946 --> 03:26:44.057
TRAVIS: Yes.

4618
03:26:44.057 --> 03:26:45.615
LAURA: I thought you loved that sword.

4619
03:26:45.615 --> 03:26:48.760
MARISHA: Were you just over it, or--?

4620
03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:50.738
TRAVIS: I talked to Jester just before we went to bed

4621
03:26:50.738 --> 03:26:53.949
and I said I felt like a change was needed,

4622
03:26:53.949 --> 03:26:56.714
and I didn't like being a pawn or a puppet,

4623
03:26:56.714 --> 03:26:58.507
and I didn't know where it was going to lead,

4624
03:26:58.507 --> 03:27:00.613
and also if that's the last key

4625
03:27:00.613 --> 03:27:02.631
before this thing is unleashed,

4626
03:27:02.631 --> 03:27:04.506
why not just destroy the--

4627
03:27:05.531 --> 03:27:06.814
the fucking key.

4628
03:27:06.814 --> 03:27:08.219
So I threw it in.

4629
03:27:09.202 --> 03:27:11.335
MARISHA: Do you still feel like you have the

4630
03:27:11.335 --> 03:27:13.882
balls inside you?

4631
03:27:13.882 --> 03:27:15.715
Or are those gone, too?

4632
03:27:17.136 --> 03:27:19.155
TRAVIS: Well, let's see.

4633
03:27:19.155 --> 03:27:22.988
And I will try to make myself look like Caleb.

4634
03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:25.453
MATT: Nothing.

4635
03:27:25.453 --> 03:27:27.617
(gasping)

4636
03:27:27.617 --> 03:27:30.237
LAURA: What are you trying to do?

4637
03:27:30.237 --> 03:27:31.654
TRAVIS: Let out a fart.

4638
03:27:32.816 --> 03:27:33.786
No.

4639
03:27:33.786 --> 03:27:35.548
SAM: You're powerless?

4640
03:27:35.548 --> 03:27:36.681
TRAVIS: I think so.

4641
03:27:36.681 --> 03:27:38.096
TALIESIN: Nonsense, he's not powerless,

4642
03:27:38.096 --> 03:27:40.900
he's just discovered a new power.

4643
03:27:40.900 --> 03:27:43.090
TRAVIS: It happened once before.

4644
03:27:43.090 --> 03:27:47.645
I was having dreams of Uk'otoa commanding me to return,

4645
03:27:47.645 --> 03:27:50.752
and to-- (sighs)

4646
03:27:52.143 --> 03:27:56.794
And to do things, and I can't do that.

4647
03:27:57.922 --> 03:28:00.358
LAURA: But you said it came back before.

4648
03:28:00.358 --> 03:28:01.614
TRAVIS: It did.

4649
03:28:01.614 --> 03:28:04.666
That was also without throwing the sword

4650
03:28:04.666 --> 03:28:07.361
into a pool of lava, but yeah.

4651
03:28:07.361 --> 03:28:09.555
LAURA: He's going to be really pissed at you, Fjord.

4652
03:28:09.555 --> 03:28:10.798
SAM: Wait a second.

4653
03:28:10.798 --> 03:28:15.764
You're weak<i>er</i> than before now.

4654
03:28:15.764 --> 03:28:16.944
TRAVIS: Considerably, I would imagine.

4655
03:28:16.944 --> 03:28:19.669
SAM: But do you <i>feel</i> better?

4656
03:28:20.925 --> 03:28:22.300
TRAVIS: I feel--

4657
03:28:25.312 --> 03:28:26.714
I don't know.

4658
03:28:26.714 --> 03:28:29.128
SAM: Do you feel pure, free, cleansed?

4659
03:28:29.128 --> 03:28:30.003
TRAVIS: I feel different.

4660
03:28:30.003 --> 03:28:34.336
I feel less weight, and at the same time, a bit less

4661
03:28:37.453 --> 03:28:42.453
valuable, rare, different, all of those things.

4662
03:28:42.574 --> 03:28:43.952
I know what you're going to say,

4663
03:28:43.952 --> 03:28:46.542
I know that you would disagree,

4664
03:28:46.542 --> 03:28:51.281
but I enjoyed the abilities that I had.

4665
03:28:51.281 --> 03:28:54.451
MARISHA: Yeah, no, abilities are dope.

4666
03:28:54.451 --> 03:28:55.715
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4667
03:28:55.715 --> 03:28:59.587
TALIESIN: You've done something almost nobody here has done.

4668
03:28:59.587 --> 03:29:01.229
You changed.

4669
03:29:02.388 --> 03:29:04.398
That's amazing.

4670
03:29:04.398 --> 03:29:07.290
MARISHA: May I ask a question?

4671
03:29:09.582 --> 03:29:13.815
Why the choice to drop the accent?

4672
03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:17.450
SAM: Was it tied to the sword?

4673
03:29:17.450 --> 03:29:21.959
MARISHA: Or did you just feel the events coincided?

4674
03:29:23.308 --> 03:29:26.318
TRAVIS: Everywhere Vandran went, he was heralded

4675
03:29:26.318 --> 03:29:30.754
as a leader, respected, people quieted when he spoke

4676
03:29:30.754 --> 03:29:33.416
without raising his voice.

4677
03:29:33.416 --> 03:29:35.750
That was never quite the case when I talked.

4678
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:38.051
It was different.

4679
03:29:38.051 --> 03:29:41.397
The first time I adopted that speech

4680
03:29:41.397 --> 03:29:45.793
and changed the way that I looked, everyone listened.

4681
03:29:45.793 --> 03:29:47.376
Everyone was quiet.

4682
03:29:48.228 --> 03:29:50.987
That felt better.

4683
03:29:52.172 --> 03:29:57.172
So I figured, no Vandran, might as well fill that void.

4684
03:29:58.540 --> 03:30:01.290
Maybe it would suit me, serve me.

4685
03:30:02.405 --> 03:30:04.738
I think it did, for a while.

4686
03:30:07.416 --> 03:30:09.437
Jester sent a message for me last night.

4687
03:30:09.437 --> 03:30:12.156
Vandran seems to be just fine.

4688
03:30:12.156 --> 03:30:16.064
Not looking for me or

4689
03:30:16.064 --> 03:30:17.872
searching out anything on his own,

4690
03:30:17.872 --> 03:30:20.435
he seems to be at peace.

4691
03:30:20.435 --> 03:30:22.430
That is not how I felt.

4692
03:30:22.430 --> 03:30:25.191
I don't feel at peace,

4693
03:30:25.191 --> 03:30:27.483
and that seems wrong.

4694
03:30:29.887 --> 03:30:34.212
If what we had was the key to a great horror or evil,

4695
03:30:34.212 --> 03:30:39.212
burying it, hiding it, I think this thing

4696
03:30:39.238 --> 03:30:42.233
would just point the next poor bloke

4697
03:30:42.233 --> 03:30:44.174
that falls into the ocean in its direction,

4698
03:30:44.174 --> 03:30:47.891
and he would, or she would find it.

4699
03:30:47.891 --> 03:30:52.832
So lava, right?

4700
03:30:54.201 --> 03:30:56.838
SAM: All your powers came from that sword?

4701
03:30:56.838 --> 03:30:58.703
LIAM: Well, let's find out.

4702
03:30:58.703 --> 03:31:00.137
TRAVIS: I didn't have them before.

4703
03:31:00.137 --> 03:31:03.260
LIAM: Put your hand out.

4704
03:31:03.260 --> 03:31:05.820
I pull off the Glove of Blasting

4705
03:31:05.820 --> 03:31:10.820
and I start to, hold on, it's not an attunement.

4706
03:31:10.841 --> 03:31:14.550
Aim at the lava.

4707
03:31:14.550 --> 03:31:17.714
TRAVIS: Are any of the Dusts awake?

4708
03:31:17.714 --> 03:31:20.642
MATT: Yes, they've been cooking, stretched--

4709
03:31:20.642 --> 03:31:22.946
TRAVIS: Oh right, yes, they're making breakfast.

4710
03:31:22.946 --> 03:31:26.619
Do you mind if I just?

4711
03:31:26.619 --> 03:31:28.386
MATT: At this point, Jeramess turns and goes,

4712
03:31:28.386 --> 03:31:31.604
"If you don't mind not, you know, causing a huge racket

4713
03:31:31.604 --> 03:31:33.693
"or setting us all on fire, maybe."

4714
03:31:33.693 --> 03:31:34.526
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4715
03:31:34.526 --> 03:31:35.359
MATT: "I appreciate that."

4716
03:31:35.359 --> 03:31:37.625
TRAVIS: Do you have like a wall that's less important

4717
03:31:37.625 --> 03:31:41.054
that could take a little bit of, like a little--

4718
03:31:41.054 --> 03:31:42.212
MATT: "Outside."

4719
03:31:43.380 --> 03:31:44.869
LIAM: That's fair.
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right.

4720
03:31:44.869 --> 03:31:47.029
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go punch a mountain.

4721
03:31:47.029 --> 03:31:47.870
LIAM: Don't punch--

4722
03:31:47.870 --> 03:31:49.649
TRAVIS: I'll walk out the tunnel just a little bit

4723
03:31:49.649 --> 03:31:52.498
and see if I can just shoot out the tunnel.

4724
03:31:52.498 --> 03:31:54.464
MATT: The rays extend and blast

4725
03:31:54.464 --> 03:31:56.303
into the side of the mountain.

4726
03:31:56.303 --> 03:31:58.570
TRAVIS: But that's the glove.

4727
03:31:58.570 --> 03:32:01.376
LIAM: Well, but it's on your hand, so you hold onto that.

4728
03:32:01.376 --> 03:32:02.851
Where's that whip?

4729
03:32:03.994 --> 03:32:05.392
LAURA: Oh, here.

4730
03:32:05.392 --> 03:32:06.447
LIAM: Yeah.

4731
03:32:06.447 --> 03:32:09.037
You have things that are more useful than this, but for now.

4732
03:32:09.037 --> 03:32:10.729
LAURA: I mean, you can also have my axe.

4733
03:32:10.729 --> 03:32:12.620
SAM: Here, take this dagger.

4734
03:32:12.620 --> 03:32:14.546
TALIESIN: I have a shield as well, if you like.

4735
03:32:14.546 --> 03:32:16.682
LAURA: Here.
LIAM: The whip, yeah.

4736
03:32:16.682 --> 03:32:19.335
LAURA: I give him the whip and the axe.

4737
03:32:19.335 --> 03:32:21.171
TRAVIS: Oh no.

4738
03:32:22.094 --> 03:32:26.206
MARISHA: Caduceus, did you have the Mollymauk sword?

4739
03:32:26.206 --> 03:32:28.248
TALIESIN: No, he ate it.

4740
03:32:28.248 --> 03:32:30.005
LAURA: He ate it.

4741
03:32:30.005 --> 03:32:31.265
TRAVIS: I ate it.

4742
03:32:31.265 --> 03:32:32.356
MARISHA: That's right.

4743
03:32:32.356 --> 03:32:34.094
(laughter)

4744
03:32:34.094 --> 03:32:36.483
TALIESIN: I do have a shield though, if--

4745
03:32:36.483 --> 03:32:38.344
TRAVIS: This is more than enough, please.

4746
03:32:38.344 --> 03:32:40.348
SAM: It's really not, you're very weak.

4747
03:32:40.348 --> 03:32:41.898
TRAVIS: Okay.

4748
03:32:41.898 --> 03:32:43.721
(laughter)

4749
03:32:43.721 --> 03:32:47.127
No, I appreciate it, I really do.

4750
03:32:47.127 --> 03:32:49.310
MARISHA: I don't have anything to give you other than drugs.

4751
03:32:49.310 --> 03:32:51.284
(laughter)

4752
03:32:51.284 --> 03:32:53.535
TRAVIS: I don't need any drugs.

4753
03:32:53.535 --> 03:32:55.862
MARISHA: Actually maybe like, you know.

4754
03:32:55.862 --> 03:32:57.567
SAM: If you're on drugs, you'll think you're magic.

4755
03:32:57.567 --> 03:32:59.576
MARISHA: Exactly, maybe it'll open something.

4756
03:32:59.576 --> 03:33:00.409
TRAVIS: Well.

4757
03:33:01.673 --> 03:33:02.633
LAURA: That's the whip.

4758
03:33:02.633 --> 03:33:04.249
LIAM: You have also talked us out of

4759
03:33:04.249 --> 03:33:05.407
a good number of scrapes,

4760
03:33:05.407 --> 03:33:09.360
and that has nothing to do with any sword or ball

4761
03:33:09.360 --> 03:33:10.550
or what have you.

4762
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:12.929
TALIESIN: Sword, glove, what's the difference at the moment?

4763
03:33:12.929 --> 03:33:14.499
TRAVIS: Of course.

4764
03:33:14.499 --> 03:33:15.969
MARISHA: I don't think there's anything wrong

4765
03:33:15.969 --> 03:33:18.595
with utilizing tools to help get you where you are,

4766
03:33:18.595 --> 03:33:21.850
and you know, maybe you're just at a place now

4767
03:33:21.850 --> 03:33:24.683
where you don't need those things.

4768
03:33:25.802 --> 03:33:27.259
TRAVIS: Perhaps.

4769
03:33:27.259 --> 03:33:31.298
But you have saved my skin, and I will be here if I can

4770
03:33:31.298 --> 03:33:35.137
to save yours, second mate.

4771
03:33:35.137 --> 03:33:36.445
MARISHA: Cap'n.

4772
03:33:37.295 --> 03:33:38.317
TRAVIS: So.

4773
03:33:38.317 --> 03:33:39.650
Enough about me.

4774
03:33:40.968 --> 03:33:45.813
Let's go to a city where elves and dwarves mingle, shall we?

4775
03:33:45.813 --> 03:33:49.221
SAM: Before we go, can I just, out of morbid curiosity,

4776
03:33:49.221 --> 03:33:50.058
could you--

4777
03:33:50.058 --> 03:33:51.921
TRAVIS: If you make a comment about my strength,

4778
03:33:51.921 --> 03:33:53.470
I might throw you in the lava.

4779
03:33:53.470 --> 03:33:55.040
SAM: You couldn't, but...

4780
03:33:55.040 --> 03:33:58.490
(laughter)

4781
03:33:58.490 --> 03:34:01.648
TRAVIS: Do we have a fire extinguisher in the studio?

4782
03:34:01.648 --> 03:34:03.853
Because I'm on fire.

4783
03:34:03.853 --> 03:34:04.752
(laughter)

4784
03:34:04.752 --> 03:34:06.123
MARISHA: Holy shit!

4785
03:34:06.123 --> 03:34:09.790
SAM: Just because I'm curious, how would you say

4786
03:34:11.136 --> 03:34:12.403
the words that are spelled

4787
03:34:12.403 --> 03:34:17.044
E-L-D-R-I-G-E

4788
03:34:17.044 --> 03:34:18.694
B-L-A-S-T?

4789
03:34:18.694 --> 03:34:19.906
How would you pronounce that?

4790
03:34:19.906 --> 03:34:22.406
How would you say those words?

4791
03:34:23.632 --> 03:34:24.680
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast.

4792
03:34:24.680 --> 03:34:26.253
SAM: Blast, no!

4793
03:34:26.253 --> 03:34:28.590
(laughter)

4794
03:34:28.590 --> 03:34:30.620
Well hell.

4795
03:34:30.620 --> 03:34:35.620
(laughter)

4796
03:34:35.881 --> 03:34:38.495
I miss the old way you said it!

4797
03:34:38.495 --> 03:34:40.202
MARISHA: Aww, Nott.

4798
03:34:40.202 --> 03:34:41.971
TRAVIS: (Texas accent) Eldritch Blast.

4799
03:34:41.971 --> 03:34:43.123
SAM: Yes.

4800
03:34:43.123 --> 03:34:44.291
That's better.

4801
03:34:44.291 --> 03:34:46.163
You drew it out a little longer.

4802
03:34:46.163 --> 03:34:49.493
TRAVIS: You do know I can't do it though, right?

4803
03:34:49.493 --> 03:34:51.907
SAM: The blaest?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4804
03:34:51.907 --> 03:34:53.392
SAM: But you could say it the way I like it.

4805
03:34:53.392 --> 03:34:54.700
TRAVIS: Just for you.
SAM: Okay.

4806
03:34:54.700 --> 03:34:57.488
LIAM: And you are very good with accents.

4807
03:34:57.488 --> 03:34:58.954
TRAVIS: I'm okay.
LIAM: That's a skill.

4808
03:34:58.954 --> 03:35:00.767
TRAVIS: Some are better.

4809
03:35:00.767 --> 03:35:02.426
LIAM: What else you got?

4810
03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:05.090
Maybe later.

4811
03:35:05.090 --> 03:35:06.339
MARISHA: Since you were

4812
03:35:06.339 --> 03:35:09.558
using your fake accent as your real accent,

4813
03:35:09.558 --> 03:35:11.914
and then your real accent as your fake accent,

4814
03:35:11.914 --> 03:35:14.249
when you talk to people does that mean you're going to like,

4815
03:35:14.249 --> 03:35:17.569
switch it up now, and we're going to hear old school Fjord,

4816
03:35:17.569 --> 03:35:20.419
or I guess technically like, middle Fjord

4817
03:35:20.419 --> 03:35:23.478
before we knew Fjord, and then we got Fjord.

4818
03:35:23.478 --> 03:35:24.388
SAM: Should we go?

4819
03:35:24.388 --> 03:35:25.671
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.

4820
03:35:25.671 --> 03:35:28.464
(laughter)

4821
03:35:28.464 --> 03:35:29.297
LIAM: Wake and bake.

4822
03:35:29.297 --> 03:35:32.100
MATT: All right.
(laughter)

4823
03:35:32.100 --> 03:35:35.017
Gathered your things, heading off, it seems

4824
03:35:35.017 --> 03:35:37.789
the snow storm has passed through the night,

4825
03:35:37.789 --> 03:35:40.953
and instead has left this valley

4826
03:35:40.953 --> 03:35:45.812
just completely packed with fresh white powder.

4827
03:35:45.812 --> 03:35:49.502
Still a gray sky ahead with little breaks of blue visible,

4828
03:35:49.502 --> 03:35:51.189
but it seems like travel for this next day

4829
03:35:51.189 --> 03:35:52.688
is going to be a little more comfortable

4830
03:35:52.688 --> 03:35:56.356
than what met you as you arrived at Kravaraad.

4831
03:35:56.356 --> 03:35:57.389
TALIESIN: (whispering) Sledding.

4832
03:35:57.389 --> 03:35:59.002
MATT: Looking at the map before you,

4833
03:35:59.002 --> 03:36:02.831
and the day or so of travel you have through the mountains

4834
03:36:02.831 --> 03:36:06.817
or further, depending on the paths you take,

4835
03:36:06.817 --> 03:36:11.539
you begin your trek towards the city of Uthodurn

4836
03:36:11.539 --> 03:36:14.574
within the Flotket Alps.

4837
03:36:14.574 --> 03:36:16.560
And that's where we'll go ahead and end tonight's episode.

4838
03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:17.739
(cheering)

4839
03:36:17.739 --> 03:36:19.194
TALIESIN: Goddamn, Travis!

4840
03:36:19.194 --> 03:36:20.179
LAURA: Well hell!

4841
03:36:20.179 --> 03:36:22.145
TALIESIN: Goddamn!

4842
03:36:22.145 --> 03:36:22.978
LIAM: Cheers.

4843
03:36:22.978 --> 03:36:25.084
MARISHA: Now you're a liability.

4844
03:36:25.084 --> 03:36:26.500
TALIESIN: Well hell.

4845
03:36:26.500 --> 03:36:28.000
LIAM and LAURA: Well hell.

4846
03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:30.580
TALIESIN: That was some stones, motherfucker.

4847
03:36:30.580 --> 03:36:31.478
MATT: Yeah!

4848
03:36:31.478 --> 03:36:33.723
TALIESIN: That was some stones!

4849
03:36:33.723 --> 03:36:35.532
MATT: I had no idea where you were going to take that,

4850
03:36:35.532 --> 03:36:37.195
and I was like, "Oh shit!"

4851
03:36:37.195 --> 03:36:38.439
(laughter)

4852
03:36:38.439 --> 03:36:39.272
TRAVIS: Nope.

4853
03:36:39.272 --> 03:36:41.235
TALIESIN: Leader of the fucking pack.

4854
03:36:41.235 --> 03:36:44.341
TRAVIS: I was about to take it back, and then--

4855
03:36:44.341 --> 03:36:45.182
LIAM: No, that was great.

4856
03:36:45.182 --> 03:36:46.015
LAURA: No.

4857
03:36:46.015 --> 03:36:47.094
TALIESIN: No.

4858
03:36:47.094 --> 03:36:50.055
SAM: Now you just have to go find magic.

4859
03:36:50.055 --> 03:36:50.888
LAURA: Yeah.

4860
03:36:50.888 --> 03:36:53.156
SAM: Magic powers again, somehow.

4861
03:36:53.156 --> 03:36:54.308
LAURA: We just got to get him some powers.

4862
03:36:54.308 --> 03:36:55.766
TALIESIN: We got it, we're ready.

4863
03:36:55.766 --> 03:36:57.459
TRAVIS: I have no idea.
LAURA: We need that Wildmother.

4864
03:36:57.459 --> 03:36:59.370
SAM: We need that fucking sword, maybe the new sword

4865
03:36:59.370 --> 03:37:01.079
will give him new powers.

4866
03:37:01.079 --> 03:37:04.314
MARISHA: Maybe it'll be like Wildmother connected--

4867
03:37:04.314 --> 03:37:07.392
SAM: You got powers from the last sword, maybe this sword?

4868
03:37:07.392 --> 03:37:09.131
Well, I don't know.

4869
03:37:09.131 --> 03:37:10.434
MARISHA: Are you going to turn into a cleric?

4870
03:37:10.434 --> 03:37:11.267
LIAM: Is it like Spin the Bottle,

4871
03:37:11.267 --> 03:37:12.475
put the sword on the ground and spin it

4872
03:37:12.475 --> 03:37:13.624
and see what class it lands on?

4873
03:37:13.624 --> 03:37:14.677
TALIESIN: Then you got to make out with whatever

4874
03:37:14.677 --> 03:37:15.777
sword lands on, wait.

4875
03:37:15.777 --> 03:37:17.885
LIAM: That's the last character.

4876
03:37:17.885 --> 03:37:19.108
(laughter)

4877
03:37:19.108 --> 03:37:20.321
TALIESIN: Wow.

4878
03:37:20.321 --> 03:37:22.144
Oh, that's true, sorry.

4879
03:37:22.144 --> 03:37:23.819
MARISHA: So many questions!

4880
03:37:23.819 --> 03:37:25.581
Maybe you'll become a paladin!

4881
03:37:25.581 --> 03:37:26.961
SAM: Maybe he'll just pray--

4882
03:37:26.961 --> 03:37:28.506
TALIESIN: Maybe this is just a weird dating sim.

4883
03:37:28.506 --> 03:37:29.553
MATT: It could be.

4884
03:37:29.553 --> 03:37:33.174
We'll find out where it goes next week on Friday,

4885
03:37:33.174 --> 03:37:36.578
Friday evening at our live show at Gen Con.

4886
03:37:36.578 --> 03:37:38.867
(laughter)

4887
03:37:38.867 --> 03:37:41.603
5:00pm Pacific, 8:00pm Eastern.

4888
03:37:41.603 --> 03:37:43.189
We'll see you guys then. In the meantime,

4889
03:37:43.189 --> 03:37:45.681
have a wonderful week, we love you very much,

4890
03:37:45.681 --> 03:37:48.594
and is it Thursday, Friday yet?

4891
03:37:48.594 --> 03:37:49.481
TALIESIN: Is it Gen Con yet?

4892
03:37:49.481 --> 03:37:50.929
MATT: Oh god, it fucked me up.

4893
03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:51.762
Good bye.

4894
03:37:51.762 --> 03:37:52.847
(laughter)

4895
03:37:52.847 --> 03:37:55.597

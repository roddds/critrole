00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.961
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

2
00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.309
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:04.981
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.371
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:10.882
MATT: Before we get into tonight's episode,

6
00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:15.297
we have to figure out why Sam is the way he is.

7
00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.370
One of our two fantastic sponsors tonight,

8
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.824
the first of which is our returning friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

9
00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:23.615
Sam?
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond ♪

10
00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:25.089
SAM: Do not use my...
(rock music)

11
00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.888
Oh, thank you.

12
00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:30.123
Do not use my common name.

13
00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:32.489
Among my coven, I am known as

14
00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.814
the Web Weaver.

15
00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:34.753
SAM: Oh god.

16
00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:36.884
SAM: Hail Zariel!

17
00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:39.577
And also hail D&amp;D Beyond for sponsoring

18
00:00:39.577 --> 00:00:42.214
this hellish episode of Critical Role.

19
00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:45.523
Our world is a pit of corruption and false idols.

20
00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:48.012
Right, now we take the left-hand path,

21
00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:51.637
walking sky-clad amid a cesspool of depravity,

22
00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:54.574
and also right now, D&amp;D Beyond is promoting

23
00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:56.648
their collaboration with--

24
00:00:56.648 --> 00:00:59.771
(laughter)

25
00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:01.979
D&amp;D Beyond is promoting their collaboration

26
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.321
with Beedle &amp; Grimm--

27
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:04.885
(laughter)

28
00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.049
(wet air sucking) Ah!

29
00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.942
Stop looking at me.

30
00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:10.894
(laughter)

31
00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:14.074
with their exclusive platinum edition box set

32
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.547
of Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus.

33
00:01:17.547 --> 00:01:20.005
Oh. My. Goth.

34
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.732
I would legit love this demonic box set,

35
00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:27.064
but my emotional soul is a desolate landscape of pain.

36
00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:30.812
Only the Nine Hells can warm this cold, dead heart.

37
00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:33.426
That being said, the box does include

38
00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:37.507
full-scale battle maps, items for in-game use,

39
00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:41.856
like jewelry and handouts, exclusive encounter cards,

40
00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:46.252
and something that even the infernal gol-- gald-- fuck.

41
00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:47.872
(laughter)

42
00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:51.389
Even the infernal god Baal would covet,

43
00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.781
a D&amp;D Beyond download code.

44
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.658
The wheel turns!

45
00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:58.850
The rapture may cleanse humanity at any moment!

46
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.314
(laughter)

47
00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:02.311
But if it takes a week or two,

48
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:07.211
then go ahead and use code GBeyondHell at D&amp;D--

49
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:08.765
(spitting)

50
00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:13.765
at dndbeyond.link/bgavernus

51
00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:17.659
to get 10% off your order.

52
00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.231
The meek shall be consecrated!

53
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:24.211
Praise Beelzebub! Praise Mephistopheles!

54
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.234
And praise D&amp;D Beyond.

55
00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:27.632
Ooh.

56
00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:28.888
TRAVIS: Holy--

57
00:02:28.888 --> 00:02:32.124
SAM: I've never met or talked to a goth person.

58
00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:33.957
I don't know how they act or anything--

59
00:02:33.957 --> 00:02:34.882
TALIESIN: I--
TRAVIS: You've got one right--

60
00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:36.031
SAM: But he's normal,

61
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.588
he's normal, I don't know, like, how a real goth person--

62
00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:39.910
TALIESIN: Wow.

63
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.743
SAM: I mean--

64
00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:42.925
TALIESIN: I mean, after this, I feel normal.

65
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:46.700
Let me tell you, this was a dark mirror to stare into,

66
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.744
this was a heavy mirror to stare into

67
00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:51.627
and I've got to reevaluate some things now.

68
00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:54.011
SAM: I mean, I've never seen you in your goth persona.

69
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:54.860
TALIESIN: That's true.

70
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.125
SAM: So I don't know what you're like.

71
00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:57.658
TALIESIN: I've definitely seen whoever this is

72
00:02:57.658 --> 00:02:59.848
at a couple clubs that I then immediately left.

73
00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:01.897
LAURA: Why does your goth persona--
TALIESIN: I'm out.

74
00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:04.247
LAURA: Your goth persona sounds like your surfer dude.

75
00:03:04.247 --> 00:03:07.296
TALIESIN: I know.
SAM: I really only do two voices, Laura.

76
00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:09.171
(laughter)

77
00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:10.187
I'm not, like--

78
00:03:10.187 --> 00:03:12.762
You guys are all really talented voice actors,

79
00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:15.424
and I just do me and slightly younger me.

80
00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:18.091
(laughter)

81
00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.133
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

82
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.170
SAM: Sure.

83
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.331
(laughter)

84
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.890
MATT: And thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

85
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.077
TRAVIS: I'm sorry?

86
00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:29.677
MATT: It's always, perpetually and eternally sorry.

87
00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:30.899
(clears throat)

88
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:35.883
Our second sponsor tonight, our friends of the Deck of Many.

89
00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.810
You've seen them, they've done the official D&amp;D cards

90
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.142
previous years. They're now releasing, if you haven't seen,

91
00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:44.525
up to this point, their new animated spell collection,

92
00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.860
which is pretty badass. If you guys haven't seen it yet.

93
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.485
They have a bunch of cards that are references

94
00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:51.015
up to level four, I think, of various spells in the game,

95
00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:54.606
but they have all the information, and they're lenticulars.

96
00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:55.860
They animate, yep.

97
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.008
(Marisha stuttering)

98
00:03:57.008 --> 00:03:58.418
Yeah, they move, they're animated.

99
00:03:58.418 --> 00:03:59.259
LAURA: Let me see one.

100
00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.578
MATT: Got Banishment.
LAURA: Ooh!

101
00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:04.016
SAM: I spent a good hour with these cards

102
00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:06.996
and my kids today, and my kids flipped out.

103
00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.681
MATT: Yeah, it's freaking cool.

104
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:12.085
Yeah, so you got this is now available,

105
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.005
which is awesome, which are the spell cards,

106
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.744
and for those who ever want to be really great DMs

107
00:04:18.744 --> 00:04:20.667
and ruin their world, there's the

108
00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:22.510
Deck of Many Animated Things, which actually has

109
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.688
all the Deck of Many Things cards that are also animated.

110
00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:26.904
LIAM: And Travis.

111
00:04:26.904 --> 00:04:28.399
MATT: There's the classic Void card

112
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.429
that gave us our one-shot, or two-shot.

113
00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:33.968
SAM: The void is like my heart and soul.

114
00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:35.508
TALIESIN: Oh, that's pretty good.
MATT: Yeah.

115
00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:38.615
(laughter)

116
00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:40.778
SAM: I'm listening to Bauhaus right now.

117
00:04:40.778 --> 00:04:44.510
MATT: There's The Fool.
It's a little more of a Sam scenario.

118
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.164
Anyway, this shit's really cool.

119
00:04:47.164 --> 00:04:50.702
These cards have all the relevant spell information you need

120
00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:52.910
to play on each of these, eight frames of animation

121
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.141
on each of the cards. They have other reference decks,

122
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:57.742
as I pointed out, which you can find at their store,

123
00:04:57.742 --> 00:05:02.388
thedeckofmany.com/criticalrole, and you can use the code

124
00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:04.967
CRITICALROLE, one word, to get $5 off your order.

125
00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:05.969
So thank you guys for your support,

126
00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.554
and go check out the cool shit!

127
00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:09.817
MARISHA: That's cool. Have it back.

128
00:05:09.817 --> 00:05:11.948
TRAVIS: Great throw.
MATT: I'll get to that.

129
00:05:11.948 --> 00:05:14.667
Well, better than like (imitates impact).

130
00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:15.870
So I appreciate the undershot.

131
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.392
TRAVIS: (arrow vibrating)
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

132
00:05:18.392 --> 00:05:20.330
It would be.

133
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.297
Awesome, we have some other announcements to get through.

134
00:05:22.297 --> 00:05:23.713

135

Also, a huge thanks to all the Critters that came out

145
00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:43.804
to Heroes Comic Con Sweden.

146
00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:45.829
I was there this past weekend in Stockholm,

I'm getting all the ones out before--

151
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.533
MATT: Oh, I gotcha, I was like bad experience in Sweden?

152
00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:58.664
LAURA: No no no, sorry, I'm testing--

153
00:05:58.664 --> 00:06:00.515
TRAVIS: It has nothing to do with anybody besides herself.

154
00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:01.348
MATT: There you go.

155
00:06:01.348 --> 00:06:02.514
(laughter)

156
00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:03.864
SAM: Jesus!

157
00:06:04.842 --> 00:06:06.394
MATT: Anyway, thank you all for coming out,

158
00:06:06.394 --> 00:06:08.291
I had a wonderful time at the convention,

159
00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:09.746
got to meet a bunch of fantastic Critters

160
00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:12.135
from all over Europe and beyond.

161
00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:15.585
But yeah, had a great time and thank you guys.

162
00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:18.150
We have an enormous programming schedule update

163
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.405
coming next Wednesday, including brand new shows

164
00:06:21.405 --> 00:06:24.511

165
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:26.268

MARISHA: (like Yoda) Content, we have!
MATT: Indeed.

168
00:06:31.194 --> 00:06:32.764
(laughter)

169
00:06:32.764 --> 00:06:34.167
So yeah, keep an eye on critrole.com

170
00:06:34.167 --> 00:06:35.863
and our social media outlets for that information

171
00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.388
as it comes.

172
00:06:37.388 --> 00:06:39.117
Also, an important housekeeping update,

173
00:06:39.117 --> 00:06:40.357
we will not have a regular episode of Critical Role

174
00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:42.349
on Thursday, October 3rd, because we have

175
00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.391
enough people out of town that--

176
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:45.323
MARISHA: It's New York Comic Con.

177
00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:46.615
MATT: Yeah, New York Comic Con.
MARISHA: Blame New York Comic Con.

178
00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:47.527
MATT: Enough people out of town that we're just

179
00:06:47.527 --> 00:06:50.160
not going to be able to really do an episode properly.

180
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.426
TRAVIS: We'll be gone.

181
00:06:51.426 --> 00:06:52.626
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: However, that doesn't mean

182
00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:54.120
we're not going to do something.

183
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.694
We'll do something pretty silly.

184
00:06:55.694 --> 00:06:58.920
A one-of-a-kind one-shot will be in place that Thursday,

185
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.451
GMed by our very own Sam Riegel.

186
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:03.565
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: I'm the Web Weaver.

187
00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:06.478
(laughter)

188
00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:11.428
MATT: Fear not, there will be shenanigans here,

189
00:07:11.428 --> 00:07:14.504
and then I believe that should be probably

190
00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:18.611
the last upheaval to the Mighty Nein's story schedule

191
00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:20.541
for a while. I know the past month has been a little shaky.

192
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.788
Sorry about that, but we're back in after that.

193
00:07:22.788 --> 00:07:25.312
This one-shot should be very interesting.

194
00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:26.963
Check out our programming announcement next Wednesday

195
00:07:26.963 --> 00:07:29.597
for the additional information on that as well.

196
00:07:29.597 --> 00:07:31.550
Laura, there's a quick announcement you have as well?

197
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.678
LAURA: Yes, I do have an announcement.

198
00:07:33.678 --> 00:07:34.847
(Matt laughing)

199
00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:39.373
Tonight is the final night for our Vex and Percy

200
00:07:40.557 --> 00:07:43.135
beautiful rings, yes, those rings,

201
00:07:43.135 --> 00:07:44.927
they'll be gone after tonight.

202
00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:46.724
SAM: Wait, this is the last time you can order them period,

203
00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:48.975
this is it.
LAURA: This is it.

204
00:07:48.975 --> 00:07:50.005
SAM: Oh shit.

205
00:07:50.005 --> 00:07:52.328
LAURA: End of pre-order, yeah, so.

206
00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:54.854
SAM: I need some more rings, so that would be good.

207
00:07:54.854 --> 00:07:56.276
MATT: So there'll be no way of getting these rings

208
00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:57.526
after the fact?

209
00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:00.567
LAURA: I'm going to find out.
MATT: Okay.

210
00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:02.350
I'm just curious.

211
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.207
TRAVIS: I don't think there will be, I think this is it.

212
00:08:04.207 --> 00:08:05.592
LAURA: I feel like this is it.

213
00:08:05.592 --> 00:08:07.626
MATT: Okay then, well then get your orders in.

214
00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:08.834
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Holy shit.

215
00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:10.528
LAURA: I'll find out and I'll let you guys know

216
00:08:10.528 --> 00:08:11.719
before the night is out.

217
00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:12.552
MATT: There you go.

218
00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:14.320
LAURA: But the pre-orders end tonight.

219
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.883
MATT: There you go. Thank you, Laura.

220
00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:16.856
LAURA: Shit, I suck at this.

221
00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:18.121
TRAVIS: Looks good on you, Taliesin, by the way.

222
00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:18.954
TALIESIN: Thank you, I feel good.

223
00:08:18.954 --> 00:08:19.787
MARISHA: It does look great.

224
00:08:19.787 --> 00:08:20.738
LAURA: Yeah, it really does.

225
00:08:20.738 --> 00:08:22.065
MARISHA: Eye-catching.
LIAM: It's a handsome ring.

226
00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:23.122
MATT: Hell yeah.

227
00:08:23.122 --> 00:08:25.550
Awesome, I believe that's the last of our announcements, so.

228
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.978
TRAVIS: Can we fork Sam's tongue before the game starts?

229
00:08:28.978 --> 00:08:30.698
SAM: Hmm, does that hurt?

230
00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:31.945
MATT: Not at all.

231
00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:34.513
You've got the length of our intro to do it, so,

232
00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:36.321
get the pliers.

233
00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:39.742
With that, let's go ahead and jump into

234
00:08:39.742 --> 00:08:42.924
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

235
00:08:42.924 --> 00:08:45.985

MATT: And welcome back. So!

271
00:10:24.136 --> 00:10:28.794
Last we left off, get a little bit of music going there.

272
00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.031
Last we left--
LAURA: Oh wait.

273
00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:30.914
MATT: Oh.

274
00:10:30.914 --> 00:10:32.104
Yes?
LAURA: The pre-orders.

275
00:10:32.104 --> 00:10:33.679
SAM: You got information?
LAURA: I already know.

276
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:34.512
SAM: Well, what is it?

277
00:10:34.512 --> 00:10:35.392
MATT: We'll get to it in a second, yes?

278
00:10:35.392 --> 00:10:38.822
LAURA: They will be gone after pre-order closes.

279
00:10:38.822 --> 00:10:41.641
No way to get them after this, so.

280
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.375
MATT: (sighs) Well, then you better get in.

281
00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.208
LAURA: Yeah.

282
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:45.599
MATT: All right.

283
00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:49.523
Last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

284
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.358
after making friends with the Bright Queen,

285
00:10:52.358 --> 00:10:57.046
after finding their way across the entirety of Xhorhas,

286
00:10:57.046 --> 00:11:00.211
seeking some sort of strange

287
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:04.001
demon entity named Obann, losing an ally

288
00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:08.608
to some sort of magic, and seeking the information

289
00:11:08.608 --> 00:11:11.389
about this Laughing Hand figure,

290
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:14.484
you made your way back to Nicodranas

291
00:11:14.484 --> 00:11:16.490
to head northward back into the Empire,

292
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.598
where all of this began.

293
00:11:18.598 --> 00:11:21.752
You met up and are currently that night

294
00:11:21.752 --> 00:11:23.924
spending the evening within some rooms provided

295
00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:28.131
by Marion Lavore within the Lavish Chateau in Nicodranas.

296
00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:31.949
You scryed on your friend Yasha, and discovered

297
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:36.351
that there is some sort of attack in the midst of happening

298
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:38.843
in some sort of a library.

299
00:11:40.218 --> 00:11:43.944
Gathering your thoughts, you rested for the night

300
00:11:43.944 --> 00:11:46.216
about as well as you could with the new information,

301
00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:50.900
and we begin with the familiar, for some of you,

302
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.818
and welcome warm sunrise in the city of Nicodranas

303
00:11:55.818 --> 00:11:57.226
on the Menagerie Coast.

304
00:11:57.226 --> 00:12:00.602
So Mighty Nein, as you come to consciousness

305
00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:03.715
and gather yourselves, what would you like to do?

306
00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:05.108
LIAM: How do you do this again?

307
00:12:05.108 --> 00:12:07.599
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

308
00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:12.711
LAURA: I'm going to go downstairs and just like,

309
00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:16.173
eat all of the pastries, because we haven't had them

310
00:12:16.173 --> 00:12:20.180
in a long time, and these ones have cinnamon.

311
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.130
TRAVIS: Take your, you know, magic bag with you,

312
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.988
so you can load up.

313
00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:27.410
LAURA: Obviously.
TRAVIS: Oh, right, sorry.

314
00:12:28.257 --> 00:12:29.099
MATT: Okay.

315
00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.464
SAM: We spent the night there?

316
00:12:30.464 --> 00:12:31.570
MATT: You did, yes.
SAM: Okay.

317
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.940
MATT: You were given rooms.

318
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.923
SAM: Am I--

319
00:12:34.923 --> 00:12:36.514
MATT: You scryed the next morning.

320
00:12:36.514 --> 00:12:38.732
LAURA: You're with-- yeah.
SAM: I'm with my family.

321
00:12:38.732 --> 00:12:41.156
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Okay, cool.

322
00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:43.315
LAURA: Did I scry in the morning?

323
00:12:43.315 --> 00:12:44.967
MATT: I'm trying to remember.

324
00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:47.206
It's been two weeks.

325
00:12:47.206 --> 00:12:49.322
LAURA: I'll look at my... (clears throat)

326
00:12:49.322 --> 00:12:53.498
MATT: Your character sheet would have the
spell spent if it was.

327
00:12:53.498 --> 00:12:57.844
Yeah, in another room, you have been reintroduced to Yeza,

328
00:12:57.844 --> 00:12:59.780
your husband, as well as Luc.

329
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.112
Old Edith is also still there,

330
00:13:04.112 --> 00:13:05.613
"slowly tripping around there."

331
00:13:05.613 --> 00:13:06.926
(laughter)

332
00:13:06.926 --> 00:13:08.996
Her sight's a bit rusty, but she is happy

333
00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:11.462
to have at least been, you know, taken out of

334
00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:13.705
a danger zone of Felderwin at the time,

335
00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:16.548
and brought Luc here, and is happy just sitting back

336
00:13:16.548 --> 00:13:19.314
and eating some different type of food for breakfast

337
00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:22.345
than what she's used to. The usual oatmeal and biscuits

338
00:13:22.345 --> 00:13:25.242
that has continuously met her in the morning,

339
00:13:25.242 --> 00:13:26.992
for most of her life.

340
00:13:28.527 --> 00:13:30.186
What would the rest of you like to do, if anything?

341
00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:32.368
LAURA: Did I already use both of my 5th-levels?

342
00:13:32.368 --> 00:13:33.465
I scryed twice this morning?

343
00:13:33.465 --> 00:13:35.459
MATT: You did. One failed and one succeeded, so.

344
00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:37.459
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Got it, okay.

345
00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:42.468
LIAM: I will go down into the common room to eat as well

346
00:13:42.468 --> 00:13:43.635
and wait for everyone to gather,

347
00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:46.282
because we need to decide-- good morning.

348
00:13:46.282 --> 00:13:47.264
LAURA: Morning, Caleb.

349
00:13:47.264 --> 00:13:49.444
LIAM: We need to decide what we are going to do

350
00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:53.447
after, you know, you spent any time with your mother?

351
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.547
LAURA: No, she wasn't awake when I came downstairs yet.

352
00:13:59.516 --> 00:14:00.600
LIAM: (sighs)

353
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.628
Probably should not stay too long.

354
00:14:03.628 --> 00:14:05.475
LAURA: We shouldn't linger.

355
00:14:05.475 --> 00:14:07.399
I know.

356
00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:09.551
We can go to Zadash, though, and see my dad,

357
00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:12.137
which will be cool.

358
00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:15.044
LIAM: That would be cool.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

359
00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:18.961
LIAM: Do you want to, are you going to discuss that

360
00:14:20.003 --> 00:14:22.247
with your mother?

361
00:14:22.247 --> 00:14:25.273
Or is that just for you?

362
00:14:25.273 --> 00:14:27.665
LAURA: I don't know yet.

363
00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:29.495
What if, you know, I talk to him

364
00:14:29.495 --> 00:14:33.070
and he's like, "Oh yeah, I totally left her, I did it,"

365
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.235
and I don't want her to know that,

366
00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:39.485
so maybe I shouldn't tell her I'm going to see him.

367
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.552
LIAM: I think there is an argument for that, yeah.

368
00:14:43.552 --> 00:14:44.918
LAURA: Right?
LIAM: Yeah, absolutely.

369
00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:46.468
LAURA: Because, I mean, honestly, if she's like,

370
00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:48.643
"Oh no, Jester, I don't want you to go see him,"

371
00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:51.109
that sucks, because I want to see him and I don't want

372
00:14:51.109 --> 00:14:54.109
to have to follow that or something.

373
00:14:56.235 --> 00:14:58.514
What do you think?

374
00:14:58.514 --> 00:15:00.590
LIAM: Well, I think that's your call to make,

375
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.018
it's a very personal choice.

376
00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:07.472
I wonder if there is some way to, you know,

377
00:15:07.472 --> 00:15:12.230
definitively settle it, with him.

378
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:15.193
LAURA: Yeah.

379
00:15:15.193 --> 00:15:16.026
What do you mean?

380
00:15:16.026 --> 00:15:17.764
SAM: Like kill him?

381
00:15:17.764 --> 00:15:18.920
LAURA: Oh, good morning, Nott.

382
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.165
SAM: Hi, sorry.

383
00:15:20.165 --> 00:15:21.420
Veth, it's Veth.

384
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.851
LAURA: Oh, right, good morning, Veth.

385
00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:26.617
Like, definitively?

386
00:15:26.617 --> 00:15:29.863
LIAM: Well, your mother thinks it's him.

387
00:15:29.863 --> 00:15:30.696
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

388
00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.954
LIAM: You could draw her a picture of him.

389
00:15:32.954 --> 00:15:34.817
LAURA: Oh, what I was thinking could be really fun,

390
00:15:34.817 --> 00:15:39.581
don't tell anyone, I was thinking, when we get to Zadash,

391
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.545
when we get to where he lives,

392
00:15:42.545 --> 00:15:45.628
I could make myself look like my mum!

393
00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:52.441
(laughter)

394
00:15:52.454 --> 00:15:54.179
LIAM: That would be something, yeah.

395
00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:55.940
MATT: Yeah, yeah, and then I could be like,

396
00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.389
"Oh my gosh, Babenon, I missed you so much," you know?

397
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:03.108
LIAM: From maybe like five to 10 feet back, yeah?

398
00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:04.823
LAURA: Well, here's the thing.

399
00:16:04.823 --> 00:16:08.520
I just feel like, you know, every time that I talk to him,

400
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.769
he's a little bit like, "Hmm, I don't know,"

401
00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:13.338
because you know, he never met me in person or anything,

402
00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:16.871
so he doesn't know for sure that it's me,

403
00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:18.454
or that I exist,

404
00:16:18.454 --> 00:16:22.297
so he might think no, but if he sees my mama,

405
00:16:22.297 --> 00:16:24.500
he will definitely know.

406
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.545
LIAM: Yeah, there will be no mistaking his reaction.

407
00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:27.498
LAURA: Exactly.

408
00:16:27.498 --> 00:16:28.872
LIAM: Just you want to be careful the reaction

409
00:16:28.872 --> 00:16:31.788
you're going to get, but there's no way to know

410
00:16:31.788 --> 00:16:32.737
unless you know.

411
00:16:32.737 --> 00:16:34.262
LAURA: If he's like,

412
00:16:34.262 --> 00:16:38.112
"Ooh, Marion, I really missed you,"

413
00:16:38.112 --> 00:16:39.910
and he comes in like he's going to do something,

414
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.241
I'll just snap myself back and then he'll know it's me

415
00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:44.674
and he won't do anything, you know, won't be weird.

416
00:16:44.674 --> 00:16:45.744
MARISHA: Who'll know it's you?

417
00:16:45.744 --> 00:16:46.956
Good morning.

418
00:16:46.956 --> 00:16:47.982
LIAM: Morning.
LAURA: Good morning, Beau.

419
00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:50.058
MARISHA: Hi.
LAURA: Have some pastries, it's cinnamon.

420
00:16:50.058 --> 00:16:50.891
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

421
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:54.948
LIAM: I think it could be weird still, but, family--

422
00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:56.741
LAURA: It'll be fine.

423
00:16:56.741 --> 00:16:57.711
TALIESIN: What'll be fine?

424
00:16:57.711 --> 00:16:58.831
Ah, good morning.

425
00:16:58.831 --> 00:16:59.930
MARISHA: Hi, Caduceus.
SAM: Morning, Caduceus.

426
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.013
LAURA: But keep it down,

427
00:17:01.013 --> 00:17:02.671
because I don't want my mom to find out.

428
00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:04.497
We're going to go see my dad.

429
00:17:04.497 --> 00:17:05.743
TALIESIN: Is your mom listening right now?

430
00:17:05.743 --> 00:17:08.078
LAURA: She could be.
TALIESIN: Oh.

431
00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:09.470
MARISHA: Yeah, it is thin walls.

432
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.956
LIAM: Does she do that?

433
00:17:10.956 --> 00:17:11.797
LAURA: No.

434
00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:12.911
MARISHA: There's no insulation in this place.

435
00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:14.909
LAURA: But I did totally do it.

436
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.355
MATT: You do hear the faint creaking of wood upstairs.

437
00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:20.537
There is movement, the shuffling about.

438
00:17:20.537 --> 00:17:21.576
LAURA: She's awake!

439
00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:23.210
MARISHA: Maybe that's Fjord.

440
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.641
TRAVIS: Morning.
MARISHA: Ah!

441
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:27.228
LAURA: Nope, wasn't Fjord.

442
00:17:27.228 --> 00:17:28.993
TRAVIS: Damn.

443
00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:30.816
LIAM: Did you used to eavesdrop on people?

444
00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.087
LAURA: All the time.

445
00:17:32.087 --> 00:17:33.315
LIAM: How did you do that?

446
00:17:33.315 --> 00:17:34.148
LAURA: What do you mean?

447
00:17:34.148 --> 00:17:36.348
LIAM: I mean, did you go to doorways

448
00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:37.459
and put your ears to them?

449
00:17:37.459 --> 00:17:39.310
LAURA: There's all these little spots.

450
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.256
You see that little crevice up there?

451
00:17:41.256 --> 00:17:43.962
You can see it through the the two slots?

452
00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:45.637
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: Where does that go?

453
00:17:45.637 --> 00:17:48.288
LAURA: Well, just on the other side of it
is another hotel room,

454
00:17:48.288 --> 00:17:51.141
but if you're in there, you can hear everything

455
00:17:51.141 --> 00:17:52.513
that's happening in this room.

456
00:17:52.513 --> 00:17:54.511
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Oh.

457
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:55.475
Hold on.

458
00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:57.201
I get up and run up there.

459
00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.034
MATT: Okay.

460
00:17:58.034 --> 00:17:59.672
LAURA: Is anybody in there?

461
00:17:59.672 --> 00:18:00.683
MATT: In the--

462
00:18:00.683 --> 00:18:02.653
LAURA: In the little crevice I used to hide in--

463
00:18:02.653 --> 00:18:03.991
MATT: There's nobody in there at the moment, no.

464
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.689
LAURA: It's all clear!

465
00:18:05.689 --> 00:18:07.439
And I come back down.

466
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.826
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, Jester, stay up there.

467
00:18:09.826 --> 00:18:11.937
LAURA: Okay. I run back up.

468
00:18:11.937 --> 00:18:13.826
MARISHA: Can you hear me now?
LAURA: Yeah.

469
00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:15.173
(louder) Yeah.

470
00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:17.043
MARISHA: (softer) Can you hear me now?

471
00:18:17.043 --> 00:18:18.175
(softer) Can you hear me now?

472
00:18:18.175 --> 00:18:19.053
(even softer) Can you hear this?

473
00:18:19.053 --> 00:18:20.363
LAURA: I can hear everything that you're saying

474
00:18:20.363 --> 00:18:22.923
because (mumbling) are the best.

475
00:18:22.923 --> 00:18:24.492
MARISHA: (whispering) What about this?

476
00:18:24.492 --> 00:18:25.743
Can you hear this?

477
00:18:25.743 --> 00:18:26.709
LAURA: (whispering) I can tell you're--

478
00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:28.225
(loudly) I can tell you're whispering!

479
00:18:28.225 --> 00:18:29.495
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

480
00:18:29.495 --> 00:18:30.612
(laughter)

481
00:18:30.612 --> 00:18:33.182
TRAVIS: Why are you all yelling so much?

482
00:18:33.182 --> 00:18:36.511
MARISHA: Oh, we're just doing a little soundcheck.

483
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:37.465
TRAVIS: Where's Jester?

484
00:18:37.465 --> 00:18:40.434
MARISHA: She's in the crevice doing the soundcheck.

485
00:18:40.434 --> 00:18:41.267
TRAVIS: Oh.

486
00:18:41.267 --> 00:18:43.038
SAM: Where is she?
MATT: (banging)

487
00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:44.925
You see Marion coming down the stairs,

488
00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:47.419
robe closed in the front.

489
00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.364
"Good morning, everyone."

490
00:18:49.364 --> 00:18:51.236
LAURA: I come running out of the crevice.

491
00:18:51.236 --> 00:18:52.845
MATT: Okay. "Ah."

492
00:18:52.845 --> 00:18:54.500
LAURA: Hi Mama.
MATT: "My Little Sapphire."

493
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.752
LAURA: Hello.

494
00:18:55.752 --> 00:18:58.029
MATT: "Good morning!"
LAURA: Good morning!

495
00:18:58.029 --> 00:19:01.940
MATT: "I wasn't expecting, you know, an arrival

496
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.697
"so late in the evening, but happy to have you.

497
00:19:04.697 --> 00:19:06.345
"How long will you be staying?"

498
00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.804
Not very long, unfortunately.

499
00:19:08.804 --> 00:19:10.450
In and out.

500
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.533
MATT: "Understood.

501
00:19:12.916 --> 00:19:15.676
"Well, if there's anything I can do before you leave,

502
00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:17.716
"let me know.

503
00:19:17.716 --> 00:19:19.137
"Do you know how long you'll be gone,

504
00:19:19.137 --> 00:19:22.105
"or will you be coming back anytime soon?"

505
00:19:22.105 --> 00:19:23.494
LAURA: Don't know anything.

506
00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:24.586
MATT: "Okay, well just--"

507
00:19:24.586 --> 00:19:26.313
LAURA: But we'll pass through again, because we have

508
00:19:26.313 --> 00:19:28.676
Traveler Con coming up, so.

509
00:19:28.676 --> 00:19:29.562
MATT: "Right."

510
00:19:29.562 --> 00:19:31.295
LAURA: Do you want to come to it?

511
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:35.635
You probably don't, but it would be really fun.

512
00:19:35.635 --> 00:19:39.214
MATT: "Tell me more about it at some point."

513
00:19:39.214 --> 00:19:40.504
LAURA: I'll send you some messages.

514
00:19:40.504 --> 00:19:41.466
MATT: "Yeah, please.

515
00:19:41.466 --> 00:19:42.736
"I'm curious to hear about it."

516
00:19:42.736 --> 00:19:44.526
TRAVIS: She's very excited, it seems to be like

517
00:19:44.526 --> 00:19:47.380
quite the crowd will be gathering for this.

518
00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.547
LAURA: Potentially.

519
00:19:48.547 --> 00:19:49.472
Mm-hmm.

520
00:19:49.472 --> 00:19:51.059
TRAVIS: A volcano, yes?

521
00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:53.731
That's got to be advertised clearly on the pamphlets.

522
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:55.390
MATT: "A volcano?"

523
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.890
LAURA: Yes, but don't worry,

524
00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.722
not in the dangerous part of it,

525
00:19:58.722 --> 00:20:01.312
just the cool part.

526
00:20:01.312 --> 00:20:03.523
MATT: "Very well. (chuckles)"

527
00:20:03.523 --> 00:20:04.499
TRAVIS: Yeah.

528
00:20:04.499 --> 00:20:06.769
MATT: "All right.

529
00:20:06.769 --> 00:20:09.020
"You have some plans.

530
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.211
"Well, regardless, before you leave,

531
00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:16.019
"just let me know so I can say goodbye.

532
00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:17.885
"I'm going to go..." and she walks over to the kitchen.

533
00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:20.709
You can see there's already a plate set aside for her,

534
00:20:20.709 --> 00:20:21.838
part of the morning routine,

535
00:20:21.838 --> 00:20:24.498
and she takes it and heads back up the stairs with it.

536
00:20:24.498 --> 00:20:26.867
MARISHA: Is she okay, does she seem okay?

537
00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:31.643
Am I getting vibes like she's upset or distressed,

538
00:20:31.643 --> 00:20:34.523
or a little stressed out?

539
00:20:34.523 --> 00:20:36.973
MATT: Make an insight check, if you want.

540
00:20:40.516 --> 00:20:42.340
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

541
00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.588
SAM: First roll.

542
00:20:43.588 --> 00:20:44.672
MARISHA: 22.

543
00:20:44.672 --> 00:20:46.374
MATT: 22.

544
00:20:46.374 --> 00:20:48.640
She seems at the very least

545
00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:51.679
sad that it's such a short meeting.

546
00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:52.512
MARISHA: Hmm.
MATT: You know.

547
00:20:52.512 --> 00:20:54.260
It doesn't seem like she's upset by anything

548
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.790
more than just the fact that it's,

549
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.862
you know, hello and goodbye.

550
00:20:58.862 --> 00:21:00.695
But that's all.
MARISHA: Okay.

551
00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:05.221
TRAVIS: I see you're all in rather good spirits this

552
00:21:05.221 --> 00:21:09.957
morning. Certainly the tale that Jester told last night

553
00:21:09.957 --> 00:21:11.207
was quite dire.

554
00:21:12.114 --> 00:21:13.434
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

555
00:21:13.434 --> 00:21:14.645
TRAVIS: Have we discussed at all how we plan

556
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:17.970
to follow up on what she saw?

557
00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:23.176
LIAM: I think we should not tarry here too long.

558
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.830
I don't know if we are going to make that

559
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.181
just part of the day or if we can wait another night.

560
00:21:29.181 --> 00:21:31.613
I hate to leave your mother so fast,

561
00:21:31.613 --> 00:21:35.355
although I worry about your people.

562
00:21:35.355 --> 00:21:37.827
MARISHA: Yeah, I should probably check in on the Soul.

563
00:21:39.827 --> 00:21:42.127
LAURA: Do I know anybody there that we

564
00:21:42.127 --> 00:21:43.568
could send a message to?

565
00:21:44.916 --> 00:21:46.710
MARISHA: Zeenoth, maybe.

566
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.802
Archivist Zeenoth.

567
00:21:47.802 --> 00:21:48.891
LAURA: I met them?

568
00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:50.538
(clattering ice sounds)
MARISHA: You met them--

569
00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:51.548
LAURA: In Zadash?

570
00:21:51.548 --> 00:21:52.773
MARISHA: Zadash early on.

571
00:21:52.773 --> 00:21:54.664
He was following me.
(clattering ice sounds)

572
00:21:54.664 --> 00:21:56.736
LAURA: What the fuck is going on?

573
00:21:56.736 --> 00:21:57.969
MARISHA: He put crushed ice in there.

574
00:21:57.969 --> 00:21:59.360
TRAVIS: Nott, are you putting sand and gravel

575
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.626
in your drinks now?

576
00:22:01.626 --> 00:22:04.600
LAURA: Wig hair all stuck to your damn...

577
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.815
(laughter)

578
00:22:05.815 --> 00:22:07.581
MATT: Just a damn mess.

579
00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:11.100
SAM: I thought crushed ice would be a good idea,

580
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.418
but it sounds like a bunch of rocks in there.

581
00:22:13.418 --> 00:22:16.470
TRAVIS: I didn't know you were such a fan of grape nuts.

582
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.928
(laughter)

583
00:22:18.928 --> 00:22:21.134
MATT: It's a Menagerie Coast delicacy.

584
00:22:21.134 --> 00:22:22.215
(laughter)

585
00:22:22.215 --> 00:22:23.670
SAM: Taliesin, I just lost one of your rings.

586
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.080
I think it fell in the flask.

587
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.747
(laughter)

588
00:22:26.747 --> 00:22:28.743
TALIESIN: Wouldn't be the first time, that's okay.

589
00:22:28.743 --> 00:22:30.213
(laughter)

590
00:22:30.213 --> 00:22:31.046
SAM: Oh god!

591
00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:32.656
(laughter)

592
00:22:32.656 --> 00:22:33.489
TRAVIS: Well.

593
00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:35.946
MATT: Off to a great start.

594
00:22:35.946 --> 00:22:38.915
TRAVIS: Only takes in that which makes it stronger.

595
00:22:38.915 --> 00:22:41.077
TALIESIN: There's a pirate ring in the flask.

596
00:22:41.077 --> 00:22:42.035
(laughter)

597
00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:43.624
MATT: He'll find it later.

598
00:22:43.624 --> 00:22:44.883
After it chips his front teeth.

599
00:22:44.883 --> 00:22:46.149
TALIESIN: Yarg.
LAURA: Oh god.

600
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:47.916
MATT: All right.

601
00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:50.758
TRAVIS: Not just Beau's compatriots, but also

602
00:22:50.758 --> 00:22:54.699
this is our first lock on where Yasha has been, period,

603
00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:57.965
since we saw her and that thing, I mean--

604
00:22:57.965 --> 00:22:59.574
LAURA: I don't know why I thought she would be sticking

605
00:22:59.574 --> 00:23:02.142
more to like unpopulated areas.

606
00:23:02.142 --> 00:23:03.275
MARISHA: It seems like whatever they were

607
00:23:03.275 --> 00:23:05.920
looking for, they found.

608
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.629
TALIESIN: Well, this could be a good thing.

609
00:23:08.629 --> 00:23:10.014
LAURA: How?

610
00:23:10.014 --> 00:23:12.494
TRAVIS: It is an incredible journey from where they were

611
00:23:12.494 --> 00:23:14.377
to Zadash, yes?

612
00:23:14.377 --> 00:23:18.093
We did it, yeah, with teleportation.

613
00:23:18.093 --> 00:23:20.432
SAM: That's right, you said that you saw them disappear

614
00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:21.850
at the end of your vision, right?

615
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:22.683
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

616
00:23:22.683 --> 00:23:25.608
SAM: So they could travel anywhere.

617
00:23:25.608 --> 00:23:28.555
TRAVIS: Is there any way to trace a teleportation

618
00:23:28.555 --> 00:23:31.008
after it's been triggered?

619
00:23:31.008 --> 00:23:32.317
MARISHA: That's an excellent question.

620
00:23:32.317 --> 00:23:34.480
SAM: If anyone could do it, it would be Caleb.

621
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.583
LIAM: Have I ever heard of such a thing?

622
00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:39.844
MATT: I mean, not beyond just scrying again

623
00:23:39.844 --> 00:23:41.369
on the individuals who teleported.

624
00:23:41.369 --> 00:23:43.116
There's nothing to trace directly.

625
00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:44.413
TRAVIS: There's no receipt that prints out,

626
00:23:44.413 --> 00:23:45.509
and it's like thank you.

627
00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:47.105
MATT: Not really, unfortunately.

628
00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:48.605
TALIESIN: Email it to you.

629
00:23:50.716 --> 00:23:52.715
They were looking for something.

630
00:23:52.715 --> 00:23:54.248
If we find out what they were looking for

631
00:23:54.248 --> 00:23:55.958
or what they took, then that might be a clue

632
00:23:55.958 --> 00:23:58.088
into how to stop what they're doing.

633
00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:01.432
It's the first moment we've had for that.

634
00:24:01.432 --> 00:24:03.224
LIAM: We won't get their too quickly either.

635
00:24:03.224 --> 00:24:04.845
We have to make our way.

636
00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:06.032
MARISHA: No, it's going to take some time.

637
00:24:06.032 --> 00:24:07.460
TALIESIN: Let's go get some horses.

638
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.876
TRAVIS: So it's a place of knowledge, yes?

639
00:24:09.876 --> 00:24:12.248
Record-keeping, history, things like that?

640
00:24:12.248 --> 00:24:13.081
MARISHA: Yeah.

641
00:24:13.081 --> 00:24:16.388
TRAVIS: How many of those are there in Wildemount?

642
00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:21.388
MARISHA: There's, I believe, just one here in Wildemount?

643
00:24:21.451 --> 00:24:23.923
MATT: Nope.
MARISHA: Two...

644
00:24:23.923 --> 00:24:26.460
here in Wildemount.
TRAVIS: Roll some fucking dice.

645
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.343
MATT: No, there's an archive

646
00:24:30.343 --> 00:24:32.064
in Rexxentrum,

647
00:24:32.064 --> 00:24:34.152
and there's one in Zadash.
MARISHA: Okay.

648
00:24:34.152 --> 00:24:36.180
Right, in the capital, and then Zadash.

649
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.226
MATT: And there's one in Port Damali.

650
00:24:38.226 --> 00:24:39.337
LIAM: These are Cobalt places?

651
00:24:39.337 --> 00:24:40.347
MATT: Yeah, Cobalt Soul.

652
00:24:40.347 --> 00:24:42.816
SAM: We're close to one.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

653
00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:43.861
MATT: It's about equidistant.

654
00:24:43.861 --> 00:24:45.561
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Oh.

655
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:46.968
TALIESIN: Hey.
MARISHA: Equidistant?

656
00:24:46.968 --> 00:24:48.435
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: And then--

657
00:24:48.435 --> 00:24:50.081
LAURA: Do you think they hit the other ones

658
00:24:50.081 --> 00:24:51.344
before they hit this one?

659
00:24:51.344 --> 00:24:52.841
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

660
00:24:52.841 --> 00:24:54.898
TRAVIS: Should we check in with Port Damali

661
00:24:54.898 --> 00:24:57.354
and see if they have been hit, and maybe

662
00:24:57.354 --> 00:24:59.673
that's where they're going next if they haven't?

663
00:24:59.673 --> 00:25:00.506
MARISHA: I don't know if I know anyone

664
00:25:00.506 --> 00:25:02.797
in Port Damali.
LAURA: It feels like, though--

665
00:25:02.797 --> 00:25:05.447
It feels like they found what they were looking for,

666
00:25:05.447 --> 00:25:06.401
you know?
TRAVIS: It does?

667
00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:07.417
LAURA: Yeah.

668
00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:08.900
MARISHA: But I don't know how many libraries

669
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.824
they hit in between.

670
00:25:09.824 --> 00:25:11.527
TALIESIN: Or they may have a teleportation circle

671
00:25:11.527 --> 00:25:14.345
to the other library, and if we say that we have

672
00:25:14.345 --> 00:25:16.965
information on what happened, maybe?

673
00:25:16.965 --> 00:25:17.798
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

674
00:25:18.663 --> 00:25:21.162
LAURA: That's true, they may be able to send us.
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure

675
00:25:21.162 --> 00:25:25.495
all the libraries have teleportation circles, right?

676
00:25:27.187 --> 00:25:32.162
MATT: For the most part, there is one in each facility that

677
00:25:32.162 --> 00:25:35.364
is used to anchor to each one

678
00:25:35.364 --> 00:25:37.072
and transition between, but it's not

679
00:25:37.072 --> 00:25:38.903
an open passageway. It's one that's utilized

680
00:25:38.903 --> 00:25:41.734
only for necessary travel of those

681
00:25:41.734 --> 00:25:43.191
that are generally pretty higher up

682
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:46.908
or on specific missions for the archive.

683
00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:49.374
MARISHA: I'm an expositor now.

684
00:25:49.374 --> 00:25:53.061
That means I've got access that I didn't have before.

685
00:25:53.061 --> 00:25:54.854
TRAVIS: Hey hey, yeah.

686
00:25:54.854 --> 00:25:57.102
SAM: Are we trying to send some sort of a message

687
00:25:57.102 --> 00:26:00.004
to the Port Damali's Cobalt Soul?

688
00:26:00.004 --> 00:26:01.852
MARISHA: I think if we just get to Zadash,

689
00:26:01.852 --> 00:26:04.357
they'll already know and we can get word from them

690
00:26:04.357 --> 00:26:07.357
if the other reserves have been hit.

691
00:26:08.197 --> 00:26:10.851
TRAVIS: Is there any sense to sending a message

692
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:12.471
to the one in Port Damali and saying

693
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:13.906
if you haven't suffered an attack,

694
00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:16.088
at least to increase your security?

695
00:26:16.088 --> 00:26:17.409
LAURA: That would be smart.

696
00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.194
TRAVIS: If they don't know of the attack in Zadash.

697
00:26:19.194 --> 00:26:22.808
MARISHA: Do I know of any expositors or archivists

698
00:26:22.808 --> 00:26:24.892
in Port Damali Cobalt Soul?

699
00:26:24.892 --> 00:26:27.047
MATT: No, unfortunately most of your studying

700
00:26:27.047 --> 00:26:28.804
was specifically within the Empire.

701
00:26:28.804 --> 00:26:30.765
SAM: We know Twiggy.

702
00:26:30.765 --> 00:26:33.518
LAURA: She was in Port Damali.

703
00:26:33.518 --> 00:26:36.935
We both would know people in Port Damali.

704
00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:41.334
MATT: Yeah, you would probably pass through some folks

705
00:26:41.334 --> 00:26:44.129
that saw your mother, but they were customers.

706
00:26:44.129 --> 00:26:46.832
You have some people that you knew back then.

707
00:26:46.832 --> 00:26:48.244
But the people that were close to you,

708
00:26:48.244 --> 00:26:50.121
you have no idea where they are.

709
00:26:50.121 --> 00:26:51.595
MARISHA: Yeah, our best bet would be reaching out

710
00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:56.077
to someone like Twiggy and having her deliver the message.

711
00:26:56.077 --> 00:26:58.080
LAURA: Do you think a message from Twiggy

712
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.052
would be very trustworthy?

713
00:27:00.052 --> 00:27:02.507
MARISHA: No, I don't.

714
00:27:02.507 --> 00:27:05.397
I think the monks at the Soul would look at her

715
00:27:05.397 --> 00:27:08.066
like she was either crazy or they'd laugh

716
00:27:08.066 --> 00:27:09.977
and say they already knew.

717
00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:12.429
SAM: Well then, to Zadash we go.

718
00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:13.875
LIAM: We need to start somewhere.

719
00:27:13.875 --> 00:27:16.568
We can't there quick as we want, but we will get there,

720
00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:19.394
and the trail will probably have gone cold,

721
00:27:19.394 --> 00:27:21.667
but you can talk to your folk.

722
00:27:21.667 --> 00:27:24.437
Maybe we will see something, if they allow us to look,

723
00:27:24.437 --> 00:27:28.561
that they missed, perhaps, and then we talk to your father,

724
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:33.144
and see if he has heard of any rumblings of the beacon.

725
00:27:34.581 --> 00:27:35.840
LAURA: Right.

726
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.195
Didn't he have some-- I don't know what's going on

727
00:27:39.195 --> 00:27:42.600
with all this locations on that map and stuff.

728
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.984
Wasn't there somewhere up north that was creepy

729
00:27:46.984 --> 00:27:49.876
that people were at?

730
00:27:50.742 --> 00:27:52.454
SAM: A little more specific.

731
00:27:52.454 --> 00:27:54.358
(laughter)

732
00:27:54.358 --> 00:27:55.191
TALIESIN: Probably.

733
00:27:55.191 --> 00:27:57.150
LAURA: You know!
LIAM: That's called Wildemount.

734
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.836
LAURA: You know when Fjord and Yasha and I were missing,

735
00:27:59.836 --> 00:28:01.693
you guys went somewhere that--

736
00:28:01.693 --> 00:28:03.192
SAM: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

737
00:28:03.192 --> 00:28:04.840
LAURA: Then there's something having to do with it.

738
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.025
MARISHA: Shadycreek.
SAM: Shadycreek Run.

739
00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:09.936
LAURA: Did you get it?

740
00:28:09.936 --> 00:28:10.981
No, you didn't.

741
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:13.231
(laughter)

742
00:28:14.889 --> 00:28:18.594
SAM: Yeah, near Shadycreek Run there was something.

743
00:28:18.594 --> 00:28:19.559
I don't remember.

744
00:28:19.559 --> 00:28:23.111
Oh, that was the family, the rival family.

745
00:28:23.111 --> 00:28:26.286
MARISHA: The Jagentoths.
SAM: The Jagoffs, yeah.

746
00:28:28.575 --> 00:28:31.833
MARISHA: Yes. Well, they're working with the slave trade,

747
00:28:31.833 --> 00:28:33.209
and Reani--

748
00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:34.295
SAM: It's all very nebulous.

749
00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:36.725
That's not a lead to go on.

750
00:28:36.725 --> 00:28:38.333
MARISHA: Unless we wanted to check in on them,

751
00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:39.979
because like, if I was going to smuggle

752
00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:43.621
a dodecahedron thing, then I might--

753
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:45.307
LAURA: Smuggle is a really funny word.

754
00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:47.562
MARISHA: Smuggle is a funny word. Yeah, it's pretty good.

755
00:28:47.562 --> 00:28:48.516
SAM: To Zadash!

756
00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:50.772
(laughter)

757
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:53.668
LAURA: How are we going to get through the border?

758
00:28:53.668 --> 00:28:55.053
MARISHA: That's another good question.

759
00:28:55.053 --> 00:28:56.273
SAM: We did it before.

760
00:28:56.273 --> 00:28:58.507
TALIESIN: Well, we did it the other way.

761
00:28:58.507 --> 00:28:59.592
SAM: No, we did it both ways.

762
00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:00.838
LAURA: We did do it both ways.

763
00:29:00.838 --> 00:29:03.255
TALIESIN: We did?
LAURA: Yeah.

764
00:29:04.553 --> 00:29:07.932
Oh, that's right. We forged a letter.

765
00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:10.387
SAM: That's right, do you still have it?

766
00:29:10.387 --> 00:29:12.345
LAURA: Maybe? No, he took it.

767
00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:14.521
SAM: It'll be on your equipment list on D&amp;D Beyond.

768
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:16.546
LAURA: Yeah, sure it will.

769
00:29:16.546 --> 00:29:18.357
Pretty sure they took it.

770
00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:20.254
MATT: You may have to forge new documentation.

771
00:29:20.254 --> 00:29:21.994
LAURA: I'm going to forge a new document,

772
00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:25.660
but now that we know, I'm going to do a good one here,

773
00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.942
so we're not going to be traveling as I'm doing it.

774
00:29:26.942 --> 00:29:29.443
TALIESIN: Does being an expositor help with that too, maybe?

775
00:29:29.443 --> 00:29:30.514
LAURA: Oh, right.

776
00:29:30.514 --> 00:29:32.755
MARISHA: I'll put back on my vestiges

777
00:29:32.755 --> 00:29:34.561
when we get closer there.

778
00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:38.173
MATT: Okay. You gather your things.

779
00:29:38.173 --> 00:29:40.124
You're buying horses?

780
00:29:40.124 --> 00:29:41.165
LAURA: Yeah.

781
00:29:41.165 --> 00:29:42.861
MATT: How many horses you buying?

782
00:29:42.861 --> 00:29:46.207
MARISHA: How many rounds of horses have we bought this game?

783
00:29:46.207 --> 00:29:48.586
MATT: You know...
TRAVIS: Keeping the horse trade alive.

784
00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:50.059
Alive!

785
00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:53.137
MATT: There's lot of wild horses
you've left out in the open,

786
00:29:53.137 --> 00:29:56.004
and three moorbounders that are wandering.

787
00:29:56.004 --> 00:29:58.570
MARISHA: We spent so much money on those moorbounders.

788
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.063
MATT: Hey, that's the problem when you teleport around

789
00:30:00.063 --> 00:30:02.797
a bunch. When you get there with animals

790
00:30:02.797 --> 00:30:04.831
and need to teleport back, you abandon them.

791
00:30:04.831 --> 00:30:05.776
LIAM: Have you watched a western?

792
00:30:05.776 --> 00:30:07.348
They don't last.

793
00:30:07.348 --> 00:30:08.430
They don't last.

794
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:12.580
TALIESIN: We want to do five horses, six horses?

795
00:30:14.097 --> 00:30:16.255
SAM: Three horses and a cart?

796
00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:17.720
LAURA: Why do we need a cart?

797
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.892
SAM: I don't want to ride a horse.

798
00:30:19.892 --> 00:30:21.658
LAURA: Nott, we're not going to just

799
00:30:21.658 --> 00:30:23.066
get a cart just for you.

800
00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:25.005
We can go so much faster without a cart.

801
00:30:25.005 --> 00:30:25.938
MARISHA: You've ridden moorbounders,

802
00:30:25.938 --> 00:30:27.013
you don't want to ride a horse?

803
00:30:27.013 --> 00:30:29.219
SAM: On the back of one, it's uncomfortable.

804
00:30:29.219 --> 00:30:32.251
LAURA: You can ride on my shoulders while I ride the horse.

805
00:30:32.251 --> 00:30:34.017
SAM: All right, fine, I'll let this one slide.

806
00:30:34.017 --> 00:30:35.077
TRAVIS: Five horses.

807
00:30:35.077 --> 00:30:36.559
LAURA: Okay.

808
00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:37.735
MATT: Okay.

809
00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:40.328
Five horses at 75 gold a piece.

810
00:30:40.328 --> 00:30:41.890
TRAVIS: Fuck!

811
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.956
LAURA: Each of us pay for our own horse?

812
00:30:44.956 --> 00:30:46.202
SAM: I'm riding on the back.

813
00:30:46.202 --> 00:30:48.553
MATT: These are riding horses, so they go pretty quickly,

814
00:30:48.553 --> 00:30:51.628
like as far as distance goes.

815
00:30:51.628 --> 00:30:52.461
LAURA: Shit.

816
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:54.743
TALIESIN: 75 gold.

817
00:30:54.743 --> 00:30:56.477
LAURA: Shit, shit! (groans)

818
00:30:56.477 --> 00:30:58.651
I just did something really bad!

819
00:30:58.651 --> 00:30:59.484
SAM: You get rid of all your gold?

820
00:30:59.484 --> 00:31:02.069
LAURA: I got rid of all my gold that I fucking had!

821
00:31:02.069 --> 00:31:03.671
Okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

822
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:05.912
Jester's gone, I'm a new character now.

823
00:31:05.912 --> 00:31:06.745
(laughter)

824
00:31:06.745 --> 00:31:07.578
TALIESIN: (wind whirling)

825
00:31:09.069 --> 00:31:11.236
TRAVIS: (deep scary voice) I'm a new character now.

826
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.627
SAM: Well, I guess we've left the--

827
00:31:16.627 --> 00:31:18.667
TRAVIS: We acquired. We are buying them, yes.

828
00:31:18.667 --> 00:31:22.150
SAM: We've left the lady, your mom's house?

829
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.292
LAURA: I'm going to go give her a hug goodbye,

830
00:31:24.292 --> 00:31:27.218
I'm not just going to ghost.

831
00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:30.776
TALIESIN: Has your laundry been done and folded?

832
00:31:30.776 --> 00:31:32.975
MATT: So yeah, you can go up to the room,

833
00:31:32.975 --> 00:31:37.895
and you see Marion's just holding a book by her

834
00:31:39.637 --> 00:31:41.769
little dresser where she keeps her jewelry,

835
00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:44.313
vanity, that's what I was looking for, the word.

836
00:31:44.313 --> 00:31:47.809
Turns towards you and goes, "Hello love."

837
00:31:47.809 --> 00:31:49.390
LAURA: Hi Mama.

838
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.935
I'm sorry we couldn't stay longer.

839
00:31:50.935 --> 00:31:52.363
MATT: "That's all right.

840
00:31:52.363 --> 00:31:56.620
"You and your friends are doing amazing wild things,

841
00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.871
"and I am just happy that you're okay.

842
00:32:00.871 --> 00:32:02.409
"But be careful."

843
00:32:02.409 --> 00:32:03.940
LAURA: I know.

844
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.128
It's really hard.

845
00:32:06.128 --> 00:32:07.971
MATT: "I can imagine."

846
00:32:07.971 --> 00:32:10.930
LAURA: There's bad things going on in the world.

847
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.226
MATT: "There always have been.

848
00:32:13.226 --> 00:32:17.832
"But it's the good people like you and your friends

849
00:32:17.832 --> 00:32:22.832
"that make the bad things not everything, right?"

850
00:32:23.454 --> 00:32:26.075
LAURA: We're trying.

851
00:32:26.075 --> 00:32:28.369
MATT: "That's all we can hope for, right?"

852
00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:29.974
LAURA: Yeah.

853
00:32:29.974 --> 00:32:34.305
These are really good people that I'm with.

854
00:32:34.305 --> 00:32:38.697
It's amazing that we found each other.

855
00:32:38.697 --> 00:32:42.364
MATT: "I've always had a good feeling about them."

856
00:32:43.429 --> 00:32:44.909
LAURA: I got you a present.

857
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:46.294
MATT: "What, you got a present for me?"

858
00:32:46.294 --> 00:32:49.071
LAURA: Yeah, it's nothing major, but I bought you--

859
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:50.825
MATT: "What did you get your mama?"

860
00:32:50.825 --> 00:32:52.406
LAURA: Hold on, let me find it.
MATT: "Okay."

861
00:32:52.406 --> 00:32:55.836
LAURA: I got you a jar of fresh honey.

862
00:32:55.836 --> 00:32:57.137
MATT: "Really?"
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

863
00:32:57.137 --> 00:33:02.137
It was from-- we went and visited bees, I talked to them.

864
00:33:02.321 --> 00:33:05.224
I know, but Caduceus told me how.

865
00:33:05.224 --> 00:33:07.343
MATT: "It's so hard for me to
believe you talking to things."

866
00:33:07.343 --> 00:33:09.761
LAURA: All you have to do is say hello.

867
00:33:09.761 --> 00:33:12.187
MATT: "Well, I will try that next time."

868
00:33:12.187 --> 00:33:15.012
"It's very good."
LAURA: Yes.

869
00:33:15.012 --> 00:33:17.483
MATT: "Thank you so much, Jester."
LAURA: You're welcome, Mama.

870
00:33:17.483 --> 00:33:19.414
(laughter)

871
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:20.491
I love you.

872
00:33:20.491 --> 00:33:21.865
MATT: "I love you, too."

873
00:33:21.865 --> 00:33:24.566
Comes in and gives you a big hug.

874
00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:27.213
Holds you a little longer, and then eventually

875
00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:29.585
lets go a bit and goes, "Oh, before you leave,

876
00:33:29.585 --> 00:33:31.001
"I got you a present, too."

877
00:33:31.001 --> 00:33:32.217
LAURA: (gasps) You did?

878
00:33:32.217 --> 00:33:33.591
MATT: "I know you've been traveling quite a bit

879
00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:37.790
"and you've been bouncing in some

880
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.320
dangerous places."

881
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.153
LAURA: Yes.

882
00:33:43.258 --> 00:33:47.018
MATT: "I've been saving up for you for some time.

883
00:33:47.018 --> 00:33:51.368
"Just in case you wanted to go to school,

884
00:33:51.368 --> 00:33:54.236
"or wanted to open a shop or whatever you wanted to do,

885
00:33:54.236 --> 00:33:57.678
"and you found a different life than I expected,

886
00:33:57.678 --> 00:33:59.923
"but if it can help keep you safe,"

887
00:33:59.923 --> 00:34:01.644
and she reaches beneath the bed

888
00:34:01.644 --> 00:34:03.853
and pulls out a small leather satchel

889
00:34:03.853 --> 00:34:06.618
that's buckled over, and has a little strap on it

890
00:34:06.618 --> 00:34:07.453
and hands it to you.

891
00:34:07.453 --> 00:34:08.953
As she hands it to you, you feel already

892
00:34:08.953 --> 00:34:12.148
the coins shake inside.

893
00:34:12.148 --> 00:34:15.390
"It isn't much, but I hope it's helpful."

894
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.539
LAURA: Thank you, Mama.

895
00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:18.539
MATT: "Of course."

896
00:34:20.662 --> 00:34:23.257
LAURA: This will do some really good things, I think.

897
00:34:23.257 --> 00:34:25.861
MATT: "I think you will do some really good things, I think.

898
00:34:25.861 --> 00:34:29.029
"That might just keep you more comfortable."

899
00:34:29.029 --> 00:34:30.207
(chuckling)

900
00:34:30.207 --> 00:34:32.423
LAURA: Thank you.
MATT: "Of course.

901
00:34:32.423 --> 00:34:34.116
"Keep talking, please."

902
00:34:34.116 --> 00:34:35.465
LAURA: I will, I'll send you so many messages.

903
00:34:35.465 --> 00:34:36.697
MATT: "I look forward to them every time."

904
00:34:36.697 --> 00:34:37.530
LAURA: Okay.

905
00:34:39.128 --> 00:34:41.336
MATT: "I love you."
LAURA: I love you, I miss you already.

906
00:34:41.336 --> 00:34:42.395
MATT: "I miss you already."

907
00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:44.627
(laughter)

908
00:34:44.627 --> 00:34:46.146
She walks you off with your friends,

909
00:34:46.146 --> 00:34:47.472
and she gives everyone a little wave

910
00:34:47.472 --> 00:34:49.360
as you're gathering the horses and says,

911
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.473
"Take care of her."

912
00:34:51.473 --> 00:34:54.108
TRAVIS: Yes, of course, as always.

913
00:34:54.108 --> 00:34:57.275
MATT: "No, but I mean it, take care of her."

914
00:34:59.433 --> 00:35:01.673
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
TRAVIS: Some fucking eye contact.

915
00:35:01.673 --> 00:35:04.322
TALIESIN: Or else, oh, okay.

916
00:35:04.322 --> 00:35:06.185
TRAVIS: I'm shook.

917
00:35:06.185 --> 00:35:07.460
MATT: She starts laughing.

918
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.496
"You're way too easy to spook, each and every one of you.

919
00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:11.887
"Need to work on that.

920
00:35:11.887 --> 00:35:13.734
"If I can get to you, imagine what

921
00:35:13.734 --> 00:35:16.539
"more impressive imposing figures can."

922
00:35:16.539 --> 00:35:18.925
LAURA: You're the most impressive and most imposing

923
00:35:18.925 --> 00:35:20.174
in the entire universe.

924
00:35:20.174 --> 00:35:21.931
MATT: "You're right, I forgot, thank you, Jester.

925
00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:22.931
"You're fine.

926
00:35:24.316 --> 00:35:26.267
"Travel safe, everyone."

927
00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:28.521
SAM: I'm going to give my little one a hug goodbye.

928
00:35:28.521 --> 00:35:29.938
MATT: Luc comes up.

929
00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:33.986
"Okay, Mom, are you killing more things?"

930
00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:35.767
SAM: Yeah, I got to go back to work.

931
00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:38.572
But I'll be back in a little while

932
00:35:38.572 --> 00:35:40.948
for just another check in.

933
00:35:40.948 --> 00:35:42.062
"MATT: "Okay.

934
00:35:42.062 --> 00:35:43.995
"What else did you shoot while you were--"

935
00:35:43.995 --> 00:35:45.963
SAM: Oh, boy, have we--

936
00:35:45.963 --> 00:35:48.597
MATT: Yeza goes like, "Uh-- (chuckles).

937
00:35:48.597 --> 00:35:50.608
"Luc, it's okay, your mother--"

938
00:35:50.608 --> 00:35:51.944
SAM: What's the last thing we shot--

939
00:35:51.944 --> 00:35:53.483
MATT: (as Yeza) "You don't have to answer that."

940
00:35:53.483 --> 00:35:54.994
MARISHA: What is the last thing we shot?

941
00:35:54.994 --> 00:35:56.296
You shot me in the fucking ass.

942
00:35:56.296 --> 00:35:58.382
SAM: I did, I shot Beauregard.
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, sorry.

943
00:35:58.382 --> 00:35:59.679
MATT: Luc's like, "That's awesome!"

944
00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:01.792
(as Yeza) "Like that's--"
TRAVIS: Exaggeration.

945
00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.570
MARISHA: Do you want to see it? I still have a wound.

946
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.827
TRAVIS: No, no, no.
MARISHA: I'll show you.

947
00:36:05.827 --> 00:36:06.964
TRAVIS: She will.

948
00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:08.209
LIAM: Keep your butt hole closed.

949
00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:09.840
MARISHA: Okay.

950
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.398
MATT: "Luc, go inside."

951
00:36:11.398 --> 00:36:12.386
(laughter)

952
00:36:12.386 --> 00:36:14.886
Sends him back in the Chateau.
SAM: Love you!

953
00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:18.125
MATT: "(sighs)"

954
00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:19.307
SAM: Be back soon.

955
00:36:19.307 --> 00:36:20.887
MATT: "Okay, we'll be here."
SAM: Okay.

956
00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:22.984
LAURA: Take care of Nugget.

957
00:36:22.984 --> 00:36:25.177
MATT: "Don't worry, we will, he's getting very big."

958
00:36:25.177 --> 00:36:26.735
SAM: Don't go near the water, it's a murderer.

959
00:36:26.735 --> 00:36:27.926
LAURA: Don't let him blink away.

960
00:36:27.926 --> 00:36:29.509
MATT: "Okay.

961
00:36:29.509 --> 00:36:30.342
"All right.

962
00:36:30.342 --> 00:36:31.720
"(chuckles)"

963
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.553
and gives up.

964
00:36:32.553 --> 00:36:35.177
MARISHA: He should get swimming lessons.

965
00:36:35.177 --> 00:36:37.515
Could save his life one day.

966
00:36:37.515 --> 00:36:41.129
SAM: Or he could die learning, I mean--

967
00:36:41.129 --> 00:36:41.970
MARISHA: What?
SAM: I feel like

968
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.696
I read somewhere that 80%

969
00:36:43.696 --> 00:36:45.583
of swimming lessons end in death.

970
00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:46.499
MATT: "That is actually

971
00:36:46.499 --> 00:36:47.876
grossly incorrect, but--"
MARISHA: I don't know what blogs

972
00:36:47.876 --> 00:36:49.026
you've been reading.

973
00:36:49.026 --> 00:36:50.424
SAM: I feel like that's an accurate number.

974
00:36:50.424 --> 00:36:51.367
LAURA: No, that's not the truth.

975
00:36:51.367 --> 00:36:53.192
That's not.
SAM: All right.

976
00:36:53.192 --> 00:36:54.170
TRAVIS: And we ride.

977
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.420
(laughter)

978
00:36:57.752 --> 00:37:00.326
MATT: He gives you a big hug and kiss, and sends you off.

979
00:37:00.326 --> 00:37:04.347
SAM: I'll drop my illusion and turn into Nott.

980
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:05.922
LIAM: Your goth disguise goes away?

981
00:37:05.922 --> 00:37:06.763
SAM: Yes.

982
00:37:06.763 --> 00:37:08.238
(laughter)

983
00:37:08.238 --> 00:37:10.223
This is my true self.

984
00:37:11.106 --> 00:37:12.638
MATT: I think at this point,
when we have our Halloween episode,

985
00:37:12.638 --> 00:37:15.110
you're just not dressed.

986
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.133
Just to keep a difference to recent designs. All right.

987
00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:20.114
LAURA: How much did my mom give me?

988
00:37:20.114 --> 00:37:21.144
MATT: You go ahead and look inside?

989
00:37:21.144 --> 00:37:22.609
LAURA: Oh yeah.
MATT: Okay.

990
00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:23.617
LAURA: As we ride away, I'm not going to

991
00:37:23.617 --> 00:37:24.942
do it in front of my mom.

992
00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:28.020
MATT: Yeah. It's 750 gold pieces.

993
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.321
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

994
00:37:29.321 --> 00:37:30.721
MATT: She's been saving up for a while.

995
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:32.096
LAURA: Oh Mama.

996
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.176
TALIESIN: Well, that covers the horses and then some.

997
00:37:36.176 --> 00:37:38.268
LAURA: We already paid for the horses, though.

998
00:37:38.268 --> 00:37:39.207
I got the money after.

999
00:37:39.207 --> 00:37:40.666
MATT: Is there anything else in Nicodranas

1000
00:37:40.666 --> 00:37:43.540
you want to do before you leave?

1001
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.373
TRAVIS: No.

1002
00:37:44.373 --> 00:37:46.081
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: I'm good.

1003
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:47.530
SAM: You did your forging? You forged?

1004
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.939
LAURA: Yes, I forged.

1005
00:37:48.939 --> 00:37:50.545
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I Fjorged.

1006
00:37:50.545 --> 00:37:52.133
(laughter)

1007
00:37:52.133 --> 00:37:54.016
MATT: Perfect.

1008
00:37:54.016 --> 00:37:57.253
You guys go ahead and begin your journey nyorthward.

1009
00:37:57.253 --> 00:37:59.456
(laughter)

1010
00:37:59.456 --> 00:38:00.289
Wow.

1011
00:38:01.132 --> 00:38:02.243
My brain.

1012
00:38:02.243 --> 00:38:03.818
LIAM: Nyerp, nyerp, nyerp.

1013
00:38:05.766 --> 00:38:09.109
MATT: Sleep apparently helps on occasion.

1014
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:11.258
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.
LAURA: You're still tired, Matt.

1015
00:38:11.258 --> 00:38:12.274
MATT: I'm fine.

1016
00:38:12.274 --> 00:38:13.348
LAURA: Oh (scoffs).

1017
00:38:13.348 --> 00:38:17.541
MATT: I'm just a little jetlagged. (chuckles)

1018
00:38:17.541 --> 00:38:21.132
All right, so, heading northward towards the Wuyun Gorge

1019
00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:23.076
and back into the Empire.

1020
00:38:23.076 --> 00:38:25.231
First off, you're going to try and forge some documentation?

1021
00:38:25.231 --> 00:38:28.595
LAURA: Yes, I was trying to do it before we got on the road

1022
00:38:28.595 --> 00:38:30.486
so that it wouldn't be all like ew.

1023
00:38:30.486 --> 00:38:32.637
MATT: What is the context of the documentation?

1024
00:38:32.637 --> 00:38:35.678
LAURA: Oh, yeah, uh--

1025
00:38:35.678 --> 00:38:39.657
It's letter from, give me a name of the Cobalt.

1026
00:38:39.657 --> 00:38:41.494
MARISHA: Archivist Zeenoth.

1027
00:38:41.494 --> 00:38:43.061
LAURA: It's Archivist Zeenoth.

1028
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:48.061
MARISHA: Giving permission for research for the crew

1029
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:52.069
in behalf of the Cobalt Reserve, Cobalt Soul.

1030
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:54.835
LAURA: Research the impacts of the

1031
00:38:54.835 --> 00:38:56.627
lunar cycles on the waves.

1032
00:38:56.627 --> 00:39:01.338
MARISHA: Uh-huh, yeah, we could say that we were working

1033
00:39:01.338 --> 00:39:03.759
with what's his face.

1034
00:39:03.759 --> 00:39:06.418
(whispering)

1035
00:39:06.418 --> 00:39:07.337
SAM: Uthodurn.

1036
00:39:07.337 --> 00:39:08.733
MARISHA: No, Uthodurn was the town.

1037
00:39:08.733 --> 00:39:11.493
Umagorn Smelt-- no, no, no.

1038
00:39:11.493 --> 00:39:13.414
SAM: Why don't we just leave it with the first name

1039
00:39:13.414 --> 00:39:14.378
you said and that's enough?

1040
00:39:14.378 --> 00:39:15.922
LAURA: Yeah, but it was going to be,

1041
00:39:15.922 --> 00:39:17.194
yeah, I guess the guards won't know that--

1042
00:39:17.194 --> 00:39:18.271
MARISHA: Archivist Demid.

1043
00:39:18.271 --> 00:39:19.635
LAURA: Yeah, I'll write all that shit out.

1044
00:39:19.635 --> 00:39:21.194
MATT: All righty. On your third draft.

1045
00:39:21.194 --> 00:39:22.027
LAURA: Yeah.

1046
00:39:22.027 --> 00:39:24.151
MATT: After having to scratch it out a few times.

1047
00:39:24.151 --> 00:39:26.524
Go ahead and make, I'll say with this,

1048
00:39:26.524 --> 00:39:28.596
make a dexterity check with your proficiency modifier.

1049
00:39:28.596 --> 00:39:31.836
TALIESIN: And a boop for it.
LAURA: Ooh!

1050
00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:34.313
TRAVIS: Getting in beforehand, all right.

1051
00:39:34.313 --> 00:39:35.362
LAURA: What is it?

1052
00:39:35.362 --> 00:39:36.884
A dexterity or performance check?

1053
00:39:36.884 --> 00:39:39.923
TRAVIS: Dexterity with your proficiency.

1054
00:39:39.923 --> 00:39:41.788
MATT: This is for, yeah, proficiency bonus

1055
00:39:41.788 --> 00:39:43.871
and your dexterity bonus.

1056
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:47.410
SAM: Wow.
TALIESIN: With a d4.

1057
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:48.585
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Wow.

1058
00:39:48.585 --> 00:39:50.857
LAURA: I know, I rolled all the things beforehand

1059
00:39:50.857 --> 00:39:53.541
and that's not--
SAM: Okay.

1060
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.454
LAURA: (uncertain noises)

1061
00:39:59.454 --> 00:40:01.004
14?
MATT: Okay.

1062
00:40:01.004 --> 00:40:02.230
SAM: Okay, okay.

1063
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.679
MATT: You feel like you've done a fair enough job.

1064
00:40:05.679 --> 00:40:06.852
LAURA: All right.

1065
00:40:06.852 --> 00:40:07.924
Sorry, guys.

1066
00:40:07.924 --> 00:40:11.579
Let's already put this in the jail for the night

1067
00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:14.471
and then this is going to get filled up.

1068
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:16.289
MATT: It is a lengthy journey.

1069
00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:18.971
Approximately 13 and a half days to get to Zadash

1070
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:20.155
on horseback.

1071
00:40:20.155 --> 00:40:21.315
But you've made this journey before,

1072
00:40:21.315 --> 00:40:23.755
and it's familiar territory.

1073
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:26.061
Making your way northward, it's going to be about,

1074
00:40:26.061 --> 00:40:30.492
if I recall, four or so days until you hit the Wuyun Gorge.

1075
00:40:30.492 --> 00:40:33.196
Is there anything you wish to do during the journey?

1076
00:40:33.196 --> 00:40:35.724
SAM: I would like to be tinkering a little bit--

1077
00:40:35.724 --> 00:40:38.219
MATT: On horseback?
SAM: -- on the back of my horse.

1078
00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:40.135
MATT: Sure.
SAM: Or when we stop to rest.

1079
00:40:40.135 --> 00:40:41.376
MATT: Okay.

1080
00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:43.242
SAM: I bought a couple of bolas?

1081
00:40:43.242 --> 00:40:45.465
LAURA: Yeah, you're like on my shoulders, aren't you?

1082
00:40:45.465 --> 00:40:47.095
So I don't want you tinkering.

1083
00:40:47.095 --> 00:40:47.975
(laughter)

1084
00:40:47.975 --> 00:40:50.681
SAM: I'm not playing with any explosives.

1085
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:53.481
I bought those two bolas, bola things?

1086
00:40:53.481 --> 00:40:55.174
I'm going to see if I can fashion,

1087
00:40:55.174 --> 00:40:59.236
because the Tinkertop Boltblaster can accommodate,

1088
00:40:59.236 --> 00:41:02.380
you know, a hefty load.

1089
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.532
I'm going to see if I can rig it so that I can

1090
00:41:06.532 --> 00:41:10.873
take two bolts and connect them with these bola things,

1091
00:41:10.873 --> 00:41:14.813
at least the string or whatever, and fashion it in a way

1092
00:41:14.813 --> 00:41:18.706
where I could shoot it, and it's like a delivery device

1093
00:41:18.706 --> 00:41:20.872
for a bola.
MATT: You got it.

1094
00:41:20.872 --> 00:41:23.376
SAM: It'll wrap around somebody and trip them up.

1095
00:41:23.376 --> 00:41:24.209
MATT: Okay.

1096
00:41:24.209 --> 00:41:27.802
Go ahead and make an intelligence check

1097
00:41:27.802 --> 00:41:29.109
with your proficiency bonus.
LAURA: Can you imagine how much

1098
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:30.443
the arrow would be like--

1099
00:41:30.443 --> 00:41:31.534
MATT: This is tinkering. Are you proficient

1100
00:41:31.534 --> 00:41:32.708
with tinkering tools?

1101
00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:34.411
SAM: I have tinkering tools.

1102
00:41:34.411 --> 00:41:35.778
MATT: But you're not proficient with them?

1103
00:41:35.778 --> 00:41:36.611
SAM: How do I tell?

1104
00:41:36.611 --> 00:41:37.764
MATT: It would be under your proficiencies.

1105
00:41:37.764 --> 00:41:38.989
SAM: Proficiencies.

1106
00:41:38.989 --> 00:41:40.633
Where's that?

1107
00:41:40.633 --> 00:41:41.534
TALIESIN: Bottom left corner.

1108
00:41:41.534 --> 00:41:42.509
SAM: Bottom left corner.

1109
00:41:42.509 --> 00:41:44.463
Proficiencies and languages.

1110
00:41:44.463 --> 00:41:45.456
Oh, tools.

1111
00:41:45.456 --> 00:41:47.672
Thieves' tools and alchemist's supplies.

1112
00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:48.905
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll

1113
00:41:48.905 --> 00:41:50.097
and just add your intelligence modifier.

1114
00:41:50.097 --> 00:41:51.323
TRAVIS: You better.

1115
00:41:51.323 --> 00:41:52.486
LAURA: Oh, Guidance.

1116
00:41:52.486 --> 00:41:54.008
SAM: Too late.
LAURA: Is it?

1117
00:41:54.008 --> 00:41:54.841
SAM: 16.

1118
00:41:55.853 --> 00:41:56.985
MATT: It's a little late on that one.

1119
00:41:56.985 --> 00:41:58.460
But that's okay, next time.

1120
00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.401
16, okay.

1121
00:41:59.401 --> 00:42:02.013
You spend some time with it on the first night

1122
00:42:02.013 --> 00:42:03.423
as you're resting around the fire,

1123
00:42:03.423 --> 00:42:05.307
the horses are off to the side,

1124
00:42:05.307 --> 00:42:07.349
and you're a couple of false shots,

1125
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:09.511
the bolts themselves, it's weird to try

1126
00:42:09.511 --> 00:42:10.942
and wedge them both in there, and it becomes

1127
00:42:10.942 --> 00:42:13.388
less of a firing of two bolts simultaneously

1128
00:42:13.388 --> 00:42:16.719
more than a single bolt becomes the delivery method,

1129
00:42:16.719 --> 00:42:19.959
that springs and fires them outward as it releases itself,

1130
00:42:19.959 --> 00:42:22.084
so it's like a crossbow bolt that doesn't have a tip,

1131
00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:24.421
instead it has both of the bolas tied back

1132
00:42:24.421 --> 00:42:26.770
and so when it hits the exit point of the crossbow,

1133
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.541
it releases it and sends it forward.

1134
00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:30.364
SAM: Way better than my idea.

1135
00:42:30.364 --> 00:42:32.000
MATT: We'll see if it functions when you try it out,

1136
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.902
but you seem pretty comfortable with the design.

1137
00:42:33.902 --> 00:42:35.539
SAM: And I have one or two of those?

1138
00:42:35.539 --> 00:42:36.638
MATT: You bought two sets, right?

1139
00:42:36.638 --> 00:42:37.875
SAM: Yeah.

1140
00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:38.908
MATT: So roll a second time.

1141
00:42:38.908 --> 00:42:40.341
LAURA: Guidance!
SAM: Guidance.

1142
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:41.394
MATT: All right, I'll give it to you there.

1143
00:42:41.394 --> 00:42:42.331
SAM: What do I do with Guidance?

1144
00:42:42.331 --> 00:42:44.356
MATT: Add a d4.
LAURA: Take a d4.

1145
00:42:44.356 --> 00:42:47.470
Give it a half fucking second so I can--

1146
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:48.356
SAM: 22 on that one.

1147
00:42:48.356 --> 00:42:49.189
MATT: 22.

1148
00:42:49.189 --> 00:42:50.214
You feel real confident about that one.

1149
00:42:50.214 --> 00:42:52.222
The first time was a run through,

1150
00:42:52.222 --> 00:42:53.953
it may or may not work, we'll find out.

1151
00:42:53.953 --> 00:42:55.469
The second one you're pretty sure will be functional.

1152
00:42:55.469 --> 00:42:57.119
SAM: Okay, great.

1153
00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.670
MATT: No worries. Anyone else?

1154
00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.735
LIAM: I would say on the journey, at least by the time

1155
00:43:00.735 --> 00:43:02.692
we get to Zadash, I would have put in the time

1156
00:43:02.692 --> 00:43:05.627
needed to transcribe the two dunamancy spells

1157
00:43:05.627 --> 00:43:06.814
into my spell book.

1158
00:43:06.814 --> 00:43:07.722
MATT: You'd be able to do that.

1159
00:43:07.722 --> 00:43:09.929
Over the journey to the Wuyun Gorge, yeah.

1160
00:43:09.929 --> 00:43:11.360
LIAM: An hour or two every night.

1161
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.882
MATT: Yeah, you'd be able to do that.

1162
00:43:12.882 --> 00:43:14.109
Okay, anyone else?

1163
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:16.160
LAURA: I'm going to give Sprinkle lots of love,

1164
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.166
because he's having a hard time.

1165
00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:19.173
MATT: (panting)

1166
00:43:19.173 --> 00:43:21.374
LAURA: Yeah he's--
MATT: He's a little spastic.

1167
00:43:21.374 --> 00:43:24.520
LAURA: This is a nice two weeks of nothing crazy

1168
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.691
where I'm going to give him lots of love and lots of treats

1169
00:43:27.691 --> 00:43:30.326
and calm him down a little bit if I can.

1170
00:43:30.326 --> 00:43:32.020
MATT: Great, perfect.

1171
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.446
MARISHA: Fjord, you want to work out?

1172
00:43:33.446 --> 00:43:35.417
Like do some jogging alongside the horses?

1173
00:43:35.417 --> 00:43:36.343
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

1174
00:43:36.343 --> 00:43:37.656
MARISHA: All right, we work out.

1175
00:43:37.656 --> 00:43:39.675
MATT: All righty. (laughter)

1176
00:43:39.675 --> 00:43:41.069
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

1177
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:44.742
MATT: Four nights of travel eventually get you

1178
00:43:44.742 --> 00:43:47.645
to the base of the Wuyun Gorge.

1179
00:43:47.645 --> 00:43:50.494
As you approach the exterior gates, you can see once again

1180
00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:53.264
there are a heavy amount of Righteous Brand

1181
00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:55.858
than what was normally there, you'd say probably 200,

1182
00:43:55.858 --> 00:43:59.381
250 or so that are just at and on the actual gate

1183
00:43:59.381 --> 00:44:03.053
looking about, and a modicum

1184
00:44:03.053 --> 00:44:06.379
of maybe three or four carts that are in the process

1185
00:44:06.379 --> 00:44:07.881
of waiting to get through.

1186
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:09.777
The gates are partially ajar.

1187
00:44:09.777 --> 00:44:11.312
They're not opening or closing, looks like a lot of folks

1188
00:44:11.312 --> 00:44:13.549
are coming back through now, and you can see some traders

1189
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:15.948
are making their way past as they watch you

1190
00:44:15.948 --> 00:44:16.965
as you continue forward.

1191
00:44:16.965 --> 00:44:19.868
MARISHA: I would have changed in my vestiges that morning

1192
00:44:19.868 --> 00:44:23.034
and all that stuff, and gotten all my Cobalt Soul shit out.

1193
00:44:23.034 --> 00:44:24.936
MATT: Raiments and everything, you got it, okay.

1194
00:44:24.936 --> 00:44:27.624
TRAVIS: Can I use my Mask of Many Faces

1195
00:44:27.624 --> 00:44:30.885
to make myself look like a Cobalt assistant?

1196
00:44:30.885 --> 00:44:32.702
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Then I will be an assistant to Beau.

1197
00:44:32.702 --> 00:44:33.884
MATT: Easy enough to do.

1198
00:44:33.884 --> 00:44:36.956
You've seen their attire well enough.

1199
00:44:36.956 --> 00:44:37.998
Anybody else?

1200
00:44:37.998 --> 00:44:41.503
LAURA: You should just make us all look like Cobalt people.

1201
00:44:41.503 --> 00:44:43.301
I'm going to do it too, I'm going to make myself

1202
00:44:43.301 --> 00:44:44.568
look like a Cobalt Soul--

1203
00:44:44.568 --> 00:44:46.133
TALIESIN: That's exciting, sure.

1204
00:44:46.133 --> 00:44:49.054
LIAM: I cast Seeming and make us look like the most boring,

1205
00:44:49.054 --> 00:44:52.370
simplistic, nondescript--
LAURA: Forgettable.

1206
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.804
MARISHA: Research monks.
LIAM: Yeah, research monkeys.

1207
00:44:54.804 --> 00:44:56.216
TRAVIS: I'm still swole.

1208
00:44:56.216 --> 00:44:57.931
LIAM: Yes, one big guy.
MATT: Okay.

1209
00:44:57.931 --> 00:44:59.497
LIAM: But boring looking,

1210
00:44:59.497 --> 00:45:01.343
a little bit of a cowlick in the back.

1211
00:45:01.343 --> 00:45:03.121
MATT: Perfect.

1212
00:45:03.121 --> 00:45:05.862
All right.
TRAVIS: I did those push-ups, come on.

1213
00:45:05.862 --> 00:45:08.214
MATT: You guys slowly approach and you get in line,

1214
00:45:08.214 --> 00:45:11.985
and every like, 15 minutes or so it shifts forward a bit,

1215
00:45:11.985 --> 00:45:13.114
one of the carts makes their way in.

1216
00:45:13.114 --> 00:45:14.727
One cart gets turned around and has to come back

1217
00:45:14.727 --> 00:45:16.559
and there's like some yelling and some cursing,

1218
00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:17.751
and you see them go back,

1219
00:45:17.751 --> 00:45:20.918
and the older woman who's at front of it is frustrated

1220
00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:25.419
and kind of-- I don't know where that came from.

1221
00:45:25.419 --> 00:45:26.849
MARISHA: Who it is.

1222
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:27.682
LIAM: Sarenrae?

1223
00:45:27.682 --> 00:45:29.115
TRAVIS: Turn your shit off.
MATT: Taliesin!

1224
00:45:29.115 --> 00:45:30.679
TALIESIN: Sorry.
MATT: That's okay.

1225
00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:31.797
(iPad beeping)

1226
00:45:31.797 --> 00:45:33.075
SAM: Oh!
MARISHA: No.

1227
00:45:33.075 --> 00:45:34.401
MATT: Goddamn it.

1228
00:45:34.401 --> 00:45:35.973
LAURA: Hey Siri?

1229
00:45:35.973 --> 00:45:36.831
TALIESIN: Don't you dare.

1230
00:45:36.831 --> 00:45:38.486
TRAVIS: Hey Siri, go fuck yourself.

1231
00:45:38.486 --> 00:45:39.971
TALIESIN: iPad, nevermind.

1232
00:45:39.971 --> 00:45:42.089
MATT: Don't ever talk like that!

1233
00:45:42.089 --> 00:45:42.975
You've seen Black Mirror.

1234
00:45:42.975 --> 00:45:46.030
MARISHA: Oh god! (laughter)

1235
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.863
LAURA: She listened?

1236
00:45:46.863 --> 00:45:48.642
TRAVIS: She said she didn't know how to respond to that.

1237
00:45:48.642 --> 00:45:51.110
MATT: I'm just saying, man!
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

1238
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:52.084
(laughter)

1239
00:45:52.084 --> 00:45:54.805
MATT: I say please and thank you to Alexa all the time,

1240
00:45:54.805 --> 00:45:55.833
just in case.

1241
00:45:55.833 --> 00:45:57.007
(laughter)

1242
00:45:57.007 --> 00:45:58.424
It's true.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1243
00:45:59.522 --> 00:46:01.043
(laughter)

1244
00:46:01.043 --> 00:46:02.900
LIAM: Are you sure about that, Travis?

1245
00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.222
(laughter)

1246
00:46:05.222 --> 00:46:06.687
MATT: About an hour or so of waiting

1247
00:46:06.687 --> 00:46:11.196
until eventually, you're second next in line here,

1248
00:46:11.196 --> 00:46:16.138
and you can see one of the Righteous Brand soldiers comes up

1249
00:46:16.138 --> 00:46:18.221
with their armored attire,

1250
00:46:18.221 --> 00:46:21.879
a stack of papers and some charcoal and a quill,

1251
00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:26.424
and as they walk up, glance over and approach.

1252
00:46:26.424 --> 00:46:29.419
"All right, what is your business?

1253
00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:32.546
"What are you coming into the Empire for?"

1254
00:46:32.546 --> 00:46:35.106
MARISHA: Just a few members of the Cobalt Soul from Zadash

1255
00:46:35.106 --> 00:46:37.460
doing a research mission.

1256
00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.627
Returning back to report our findings.

1257
00:46:44.411 --> 00:46:46.411
MATT: "(sighs)"

1258
00:46:49.508 --> 00:46:54.452
Starts giving a discerning look over each of you.

1259
00:46:54.452 --> 00:46:57.418
"And you say you're here returning,

1260
00:46:57.418 --> 00:47:00.223
"or traveling towards too,

1261
00:47:00.223 --> 00:47:03.851
"and this is for a Mr. Zeenoth?"

1262
00:47:03.851 --> 00:47:06.232
MARISHA: Yeah, Archivist Zeenoth, one of the heads

1263
00:47:06.232 --> 00:47:10.198
of the Cobalt Soul, located there in Zadash.

1264
00:47:10.198 --> 00:47:14.531
MATT: Technically not lying, so make a persuasion check.

1265
00:47:15.734 --> 00:47:17.329
MARISHA: Man, I should've lied.

1266
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:20.235
(laughter)

1267
00:47:20.235 --> 00:47:21.519
LAURA: Oh, Guidance, Guidance.

1268
00:47:21.519 --> 00:47:22.519
MARISHA: Thank you!

1269
00:47:23.718 --> 00:47:24.877
Persuasion?

1270
00:47:27.403 --> 00:47:28.236
11.

1271
00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:33.047
12, no, 11, 11.

1272
00:47:37.233 --> 00:47:38.874
MATT: "I regret to inform you that at this time,

1273
00:47:38.874 --> 00:47:40.727
"we are being extremely careful with those

1274
00:47:40.727 --> 00:47:43.716
"that make their way in and out of the southern

1275
00:47:43.716 --> 00:47:46.502
"of western Wynandir and all the Truscan Vale.

1276
00:47:46.502 --> 00:47:49.898
"I apologize that we cannot let you through.

1277
00:47:49.898 --> 00:47:52.973
"If you would like to, you can return to Port Damali

1278
00:47:52.973 --> 00:47:56.327
"and perhaps acquire a second means of referral,

1279
00:47:56.327 --> 00:47:59.483
"but at this time, I cannot approve your transition.

1280
00:47:59.483 --> 00:48:00.316
"My apologies,"

1281
00:48:00.316 --> 00:48:04.044
and he hands the paper back and turns around.

1282
00:48:04.044 --> 00:48:07.283
TRAVIS: Two dozen guards?

1283
00:48:07.283 --> 00:48:08.779
MATT: About, yeah.

1284
00:48:08.779 --> 00:48:09.817
LAURA: That's fine.

1285
00:48:09.817 --> 00:48:11.009
MARISHA: Someone want to do a Friends?

1286
00:48:11.009 --> 00:48:12.307
Someone want to try somin'-somin' here?

1287
00:48:12.307 --> 00:48:13.497
LAURA: Oh, that's a good idea.

1288
00:48:13.497 --> 00:48:15.773
MARISHA: Someone want to do one more attempt at this?

1289
00:48:15.773 --> 00:48:17.880
LAURA: This is a good idea. I'm going to cast--

1290
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.576
MATT: The two soldiers begin to approach,

1291
00:48:19.576 --> 00:48:20.795
start maneuvering the horses

1292
00:48:20.795 --> 00:48:23.289
to turn off and turn around.

1293
00:48:23.289 --> 00:48:24.122
What are you doing?

1294
00:48:24.122 --> 00:48:26.622
LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person.

1295
00:48:26.622 --> 00:48:28.339
MATT: Charm Person on?

1296
00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:31.205
LAURA: At

1297
00:48:31.205 --> 00:48:33.097
4th-level

1298
00:48:33.097 --> 00:48:34.494
so I can charm any of the guards

1299
00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:39.062
that are within reach. I can charm four people.

1300
00:48:39.062 --> 00:48:40.982
SAM: Charm.

1301
00:48:40.982 --> 00:48:43.065
MATT: Yeah, at 4th-level, you would be able to charm four.

1302
00:48:43.065 --> 00:48:44.049
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1303
00:48:44.049 --> 00:48:47.453
MATT: All right, let's go ahead and roll some wisdom saves.

1304
00:48:47.453 --> 00:48:49.284
Your spell DC is?

1305
00:48:49.284 --> 00:48:51.067
LAURA: 17.
MATT: 17.

1306
00:48:51.067 --> 00:48:53.400
MARISHA: Come on, come on, come on.

1307
00:48:57.348 --> 00:48:59.655
MATT: All right.

1308
00:48:59.655 --> 00:49:03.248
The guy you were talking to, one of the two soldiers

1309
00:49:03.248 --> 00:49:05.884
that was pushing the horses aside to turn them around,

1310
00:49:05.884 --> 00:49:08.239
and one who was by the gate all turn towards you

1311
00:49:08.239 --> 00:49:11.789
and go, and the main guard goes,

1312
00:49:14.142 --> 00:49:16.666
"I apologize, I've just not been eating very well.

1313
00:49:16.666 --> 00:49:18.056
"I don't mean to be as crabby.

1314
00:49:18.056 --> 00:49:20.056
"I did not recognize you.

1315
00:49:22.868 --> 00:49:24.345
"Sincerely, no worries.

1316
00:49:24.345 --> 00:49:26.338
"We'll pass them through, pass them through."

1317
00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:28.122
MARISHA: Thank you so much.
LAURA: Thank you, thank you.

1318
00:49:28.122 --> 00:49:30.417
MATT: The one other guard who's like, "Wait, what?"

1319
00:49:30.417 --> 00:49:32.499
LAURA: This is very prominent.

1320
00:49:32.499 --> 00:49:35.802
MATT: "Sir, why would you," and he approaches

1321
00:49:35.802 --> 00:49:39.117
to talk to him, he's like, "We don't want to mess

1322
00:49:39.117 --> 00:49:40.189
"with their official business.

1323
00:49:40.189 --> 00:49:41.890
"They know what they're doing."

1324
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:43.596
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

1325
00:49:43.596 --> 00:49:45.204
LAURA: Waves.

1326
00:49:45.204 --> 00:49:46.402
Moons.

1327
00:49:46.402 --> 00:49:48.120
MATT: "(sighs)"

1328
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.298
They create a space.

1329
00:49:49.298 --> 00:49:51.797
The horses maneuver back towards the pathway,

1330
00:49:51.797 --> 00:49:53.860
and you guys eventually are guided back to the gate

1331
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.127
on the opposite side.

1332
00:49:55.127 --> 00:49:57.583
You come through the other side, and from there you can see

1333
00:49:57.583 --> 00:49:59.848
there's another 80 or so Righteous Brand.

1334
00:49:59.848 --> 00:50:02.096
ALL: Oh!

1335
00:50:02.096 --> 00:50:05.214
MATT: That are waiting carefully,

1336
00:50:05.214 --> 00:50:08.792
keeping eyes on the high mountain sides as well,

1337
00:50:08.792 --> 00:50:12.246
in case anyone tries to bypass the gates.

1338
00:50:12.246 --> 00:50:14.342
MARISHA: It's an entire fucking battalion.

1339
00:50:14.342 --> 00:50:17.914
LAURA: Let's ride on very quickly

1340
00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:18.894
away from there.
SAM: Knowledge!

1341
00:50:18.894 --> 00:50:20.346
MARISHA: Thank you!
LAURA: Smart!

1342
00:50:20.346 --> 00:50:21.185
SAM: Knowledge!

1343
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:22.793
MARISHA: Archivists!
SAM: Academia!

1344
00:50:22.793 --> 00:50:24.715
LAURA: Learning!
MARISHA: Yes!

1345
00:50:24.715 --> 00:50:26.107
LAURA: Learning!

1346
00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:28.732
(laughter)

1347
00:50:28.732 --> 00:50:30.782
MATT: As they begin to vanish in the distance

1348
00:50:30.782 --> 00:50:31.619
from the shouting,

1349
00:50:31.619 --> 00:50:34.927
you can glance back and you can see some of them going--

1350
00:50:34.927 --> 00:50:37.559
LAURA: Drop Seeming and--
MARISHA: Go, go, go!

1351
00:50:37.559 --> 00:50:40.725
SAM: Don't drop Seeming, just keep going, keep going.

1352
00:50:40.725 --> 00:50:42.053
MARISHA: We didn't do anything wrong.

1353
00:50:42.053 --> 00:50:43.800
MATT: So you continue rushing onward.

1354
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.196
LIAM: Diplomatic immunity.

1355
00:50:46.196 --> 00:50:48.016
SAM: Academic immunity.

1356
00:50:48.016 --> 00:50:49.210
(laughter)

1357
00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:50.216
MATT: All right.

1358
00:50:50.216 --> 00:50:54.993
It's another two, two and a half days to Trostenwald,

1359
00:50:54.993 --> 00:50:57.956
where a lot of this began.

1360
00:50:57.956 --> 00:51:00.130
Is there anything you wish to do along this journey,

1361
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.165
or upon arrival?

1362
00:51:01.165 --> 00:51:03.346
LIAM: Yeah, I will take the next couple of days

1363
00:51:03.346 --> 00:51:07.086
to try to get everyone in the group

1364
00:51:07.086 --> 00:51:10.262
to know the names of the Cerberus Assembly.

1365
00:51:10.262 --> 00:51:14.618
In fact, I take the time to write down their names

1366
00:51:14.618 --> 00:51:18.058
and their position, and a little bit about each of them,

1367
00:51:18.058 --> 00:51:19.216
and I pass those out to the group,

1368
00:51:19.216 --> 00:51:20.888
which I am going to do right now.

1369
00:51:20.888 --> 00:51:22.361
MATT: Ah.

1370
00:51:22.361 --> 00:51:23.778
TALIESIN: Handout.
LAURA: What!

1371
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:25.674
LIAM: Hand it down.

1372
00:51:25.674 --> 00:51:27.408
TRAVIS: Let's look at the names that I never

1373
00:51:27.408 --> 00:51:30.156
would have spelled that, nope, that would have been wrong.

1374
00:51:30.156 --> 00:51:31.436
Yep, not a chance.

1375
00:51:31.436 --> 00:51:34.541
SAM: Oh, you sprayed a little perfume on it, that's so nice.

1376
00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:36.258
(chuckling)

1377
00:51:36.258 --> 00:51:37.091
LIAM: That's cloves.

1378
00:51:37.091 --> 00:51:38.442
(laughter)

1379
00:51:38.442 --> 00:51:39.684
SAM: Yeah, man!

1380
00:51:41.074 --> 00:51:43.692
LAURA: Should I try to scry on Yasha one more time

1381
00:51:43.692 --> 00:51:45.332
and see where they are right now?

1382
00:51:45.332 --> 00:51:46.363
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: If I can?

1383
00:51:46.363 --> 00:51:47.411
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

1384
00:51:47.411 --> 00:51:49.157
Are we stopping for the night, then?

1385
00:51:49.157 --> 00:51:50.330
LAURA: Yeah, on our first night.

1386
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:51.896
MATT: Your first night heading northward?

1387
00:51:51.896 --> 00:51:52.929
Okay.

1388
00:51:52.929 --> 00:51:55.360
You guys head off, you begin to sit up your ritual

1389
00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.169
in the middle of grassy field here.

1390
00:51:57.169 --> 00:52:00.735
You know, after being in Zadash so long,

1391
00:52:00.735 --> 00:52:03.763
and then the snowy regions of the Flotket Alps,

1392
00:52:03.763 --> 00:52:05.822
It's been nice to head northward

1393
00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:09.161
through the Menagerie Coast, along the grassy fields

1394
00:52:09.161 --> 00:52:11.157
and the jungles that led you to the Wuyun Gorge,

1395
00:52:11.157 --> 00:52:15.843
and now back into the familiar, lush fields and plains

1396
00:52:15.843 --> 00:52:18.593
of the southern area of Wynandir.

1397
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.292
You prepare your ritual.

1398
00:52:21.292 --> 00:52:25.207
Focusing your eyes once more down upon the sigil

1399
00:52:25.207 --> 00:52:28.138
you've drawn out across the dirt, focusing for a moment,

1400
00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:29.994
and you feel the presence of the Traveler there

1401
00:52:29.994 --> 00:52:32.314
backing you up, and of channeling the vision

1402
00:52:32.314 --> 00:52:34.064
through him into you.

1403
00:52:39.509 --> 00:52:41.583
Your vision begins to shift as you hear

1404
00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:45.750
the Traveler's voice say, "Ah, I think we have her."

1405
00:52:47.762 --> 00:52:50.028
Your vision pulls back into the clouds,

1406
00:52:50.028 --> 00:52:52.340
dark at night, you can see the stars for a second

1407
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.861
before there's a thrust of movement.

1408
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:58.642
You feel yourself get momentarily almost jostled

1409
00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:01.249
from the movement before you're brought into

1410
00:53:01.249 --> 00:53:05.332
a meeting of mountain and hills.

1411
00:53:06.955 --> 00:53:10.619
You can see Yasha, and just beyond the periphery

1412
00:53:10.619 --> 00:53:13.599
another figure, herself cloaked and hooded,

1413
00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:15.133
the secondary figure cloaked and hooded,

1414
00:53:15.133 --> 00:53:18.859
and a large, looming cloaked and hooded figure

1415
00:53:18.859 --> 00:53:21.680
moving forward, there right at the base

1416
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.870
of these rocky mountains.

1417
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.850
It looks like grassless rolling hills.

1418
00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:27.943
The soil nearby strangely dotted

1419
00:53:27.943 --> 00:53:31.008
with multicolored minerals and odd scrub bush.

1420
00:53:31.008 --> 00:53:33.288
LAURA: Does it look familiar, does it look familiar

1421
00:53:33.288 --> 00:53:35.598
with any location I've been to or seen?

1422
00:53:35.598 --> 00:53:38.353
MATT: Nothing you've been to or seen.
LAURA: Okay.

1423
00:53:38.353 --> 00:53:42.306
MATT: As I'm watching, they stop for a second,

1424
00:53:42.306 --> 00:53:45.035
and Yasha pulls her hood back and

1425
00:53:45.035 --> 00:53:47.428
looks off in the distance.

1426
00:53:47.428 --> 00:53:50.011
Make a perception check for me.

1427
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:54.496
LAURA: Goddamn it, I told you!

1428
00:53:55.558 --> 00:53:56.399
Seven.

1429
00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.566
MATT: Seven, okay.

1430
00:53:59.224 --> 00:54:03.003
Puts the hood back up, and they continue walking forward.

1431
00:54:03.003 --> 00:54:07.866
A few moments later you hear a (poofing, splashing),

1432
00:54:07.866 --> 00:54:10.032
and they all move out of the way

1433
00:54:10.032 --> 00:54:12.104
and you can see a little bit of spray coming.

1434
00:54:12.104 --> 00:54:13.722
Changing perspective there,

1435
00:54:13.722 --> 00:54:15.831
it looks to be a heavy plume of steam rising nearby,

1436
00:54:15.831 --> 00:54:18.256
and a geyser of hot water suddenly sprays

1437
00:54:18.256 --> 00:54:23.256
from a pool-like vent not far from them across the ground.

1438
00:54:23.574 --> 00:54:26.553
They move around slightly.

1439
00:54:26.553 --> 00:54:27.723
This area has some sort of

1440
00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:29.811
geothermal activity to it.

1441
00:54:30.719 --> 00:54:35.519
They're quietly just walking, under cover of night.

1442
00:54:35.519 --> 00:54:37.602
LAURA: Can I see Yasha's eyes?

1443
00:54:39.818 --> 00:54:41.956
MATT: This would be, yeah, it's the same time of night

1444
00:54:41.956 --> 00:54:43.303
you guys would be.

1445
00:54:43.303 --> 00:54:45.410
Or at least it's night where they are,

1446
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:46.429
and it's night where you are.

1447
00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:47.947
MARISHA: It's not like a different side of the world.

1448
00:54:47.947 --> 00:54:49.087
MATT: It doesn't seem to be.

1449
00:54:49.087 --> 00:54:51.670
It's in the north-south region.

1450
00:54:52.735 --> 00:54:54.782
Of course, night can fall quite a distance on a continent.

1451
00:54:54.782 --> 00:54:55.615
MARISHA: Yeah.

1452
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.540
MATT: So same continent, you gather.

1453
00:55:01.076 --> 00:55:02.648
Unfortunately, with the perception roll you made,

1454
00:55:02.648 --> 00:55:05.097
you can't see much else, you just can make out

1455
00:55:05.097 --> 00:55:06.764
the fact that it is Yasha.

1456
00:55:06.764 --> 00:55:10.274
About 10 minutes of them perusing this journey,

1457
00:55:10.274 --> 00:55:14.107
your spell fades and the scry loses its anchor.

1458
00:55:15.873 --> 00:55:17.320
LAURA: They're on the move.

1459
00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.920
There are geysers.

1460
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.800
SAM: Geysers?

1461
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.897
LAURA: Do we know of anywhere that has that kind of--

1462
00:55:23.897 --> 00:55:25.814
LIAM: Have I read anything about the geography

1463
00:55:25.814 --> 00:55:26.733
of this continent?

1464
00:55:26.733 --> 00:55:27.652
MATT: Make a history check.
LAURA: Rocky mountains,

1465
00:55:27.652 --> 00:55:29.232
and hills that have no grass on them.

1466
00:55:29.232 --> 00:55:32.555
TRAVIS: There aren't any geysers in Rexxentrum, are there?

1467
00:55:32.555 --> 00:55:33.688
MARISHA: (sighs) Damn it.

1468
00:55:33.688 --> 00:55:35.416
MATT: Actually, you would have
advantage on this, Beauregard.

1469
00:55:35.416 --> 00:55:36.800
MARISHA: I would have advantage?
MATT: You would.

1470
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.824
LAURA: Guidance.
MARISHA: And Guidance?

1471
00:55:38.824 --> 00:55:41.167
TALIESIN: Both of you.
LIAM: Both of us.

1472
00:55:41.167 --> 00:55:42.635
MATT: She just has advantage.

1473
00:55:42.635 --> 00:55:45.055
LIAM: Okay, I got a 19.
MATT: Okay.

1474
00:55:45.055 --> 00:55:46.524
LAURA: Oh, you had Guidance though, from him.

1475
00:55:46.524 --> 00:55:47.384
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1476
00:55:47.384 --> 00:55:48.637
LIAM: I got that.

1477
00:55:48.637 --> 00:55:50.272
20.

1478
00:55:50.272 --> 00:55:51.132
MARISHA: 26.

1479
00:55:51.132 --> 00:55:51.975
TALIESIN: Ooh.

1480
00:55:51.975 --> 00:55:52.808
MATT: Okay.

1481
00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:55.214
It makes sense, because one of the regions that

1482
00:55:55.214 --> 00:55:58.335
you're very familiar with--
MARISHA: Oh no.

1483
00:55:58.335 --> 00:56:00.988
MATT: -- is the city of Kamordah.

1484
00:56:00.988 --> 00:56:02.007
SAM: Kamordah?

1485
00:56:02.007 --> 00:56:04.091
MATT: Near the base of Mount Mentiri,

1486
00:56:04.091 --> 00:56:07.131
there's something about the mountainous region around it,

1487
00:56:07.131 --> 00:56:10.975
that has, since it was founded, given rise

1488
00:56:10.975 --> 00:56:13.228
to a bunch of strange geothermal activity

1489
00:56:13.228 --> 00:56:16.746
that has altered the landscape

1490
00:56:16.746 --> 00:56:19.264
to where the vegetation that grow there,

1491
00:56:19.264 --> 00:56:21.990
the few kinds that do naturally

1492
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.429
are very alien to the rest of the Empire.

1493
00:56:24.429 --> 00:56:26.969
That's also why a lot of the vineyards there

1494
00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:29.027
are so sought after, because only certain types

1495
00:56:29.027 --> 00:56:33.731
of wines and liquors can be made

1496
00:56:33.731 --> 00:56:36.231
based on the topography surrounding Kamordah.

1497
00:56:36.231 --> 00:56:37.975
TRAVIS: Bromkiln Hills?

1498
00:56:37.975 --> 00:56:39.110
MATT: That's one place you know of

1499
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:40.410
at which this type of activity is familiar,

1500
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:41.448
and you're very familiar with it,

1501
00:56:41.448 --> 00:56:43.576
because it's where you grew up.

1502
00:56:43.576 --> 00:56:44.409
MARISHA: Just...

1503
00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:48.595
LAURA: Is it the only place, Beau, that's like that?

1504
00:56:48.595 --> 00:56:50.098
MATT: There are other places like that.

1505
00:56:50.098 --> 00:56:54.043
MARISHA: No, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't imagine so.

1506
00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:57.210
Beau just like wipes away tears.

1507
00:56:58.582 --> 00:57:02.541
I mean, why would they go to Kamordah?

1508
00:57:02.541 --> 00:57:04.567
SAM: Is there a Cobalt Soul there?

1509
00:57:04.567 --> 00:57:05.408
MARISHA: No.

1510
00:57:05.408 --> 00:57:09.564
SAM: Is there anything important for the Empire there?

1511
00:57:09.564 --> 00:57:11.155
MARISHA: No, it's a wine town,

1512
00:57:11.155 --> 00:57:12.771
and it's a little upper class.

1513
00:57:12.771 --> 00:57:15.425
It's like a suburb of Zadash.

1514
00:57:15.425 --> 00:57:16.922
TALIESIN: Maybe they're on their way somewhere.

1515
00:57:16.922 --> 00:57:17.755
LAURA: Is it on the way to Zadash,

1516
00:57:17.755 --> 00:57:19.563
or is it away from Zadash?

1517
00:57:19.563 --> 00:57:20.621
LIAM: What about--

1518
00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:22.444
MARISHA: Neighboring Zadash, it's a few hours.

1519
00:57:22.444 --> 00:57:24.303
SAM: They can teleport anywhere.

1520
00:57:24.303 --> 00:57:26.399
TRAVIS: They're moving west--
MARISHA: It's west of Zadash.

1521
00:57:26.399 --> 00:57:30.400
TRAVIS: Just so you know, it is roughly the same distance

1522
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.263
from here to Zadash that it is to Kamordah.

1523
00:57:34.263 --> 00:57:36.498
LIAM: These geysers, they're not in town, are they?

1524
00:57:36.498 --> 00:57:39.998
They're outside of the town you come from?

1525
00:57:41.065 --> 00:57:45.532
MARISHA: There's a lot of mineral-rich soil

1526
00:57:45.532 --> 00:57:48.747
and geothermal activity around there,

1527
00:57:48.747 --> 00:57:51.677
which is why there's certain grapes

1528
00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:55.725
that grow really well and make really great wine.

1529
00:57:55.725 --> 00:57:58.436
LAURA: Maybe they just got thirsty.

1530
00:57:58.436 --> 00:58:00.333
SAM: Lionett wine.

1531
00:58:00.333 --> 00:58:02.140
TRAVIS: I don't know why they're moving West.

1532
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:03.203
LAURA: Holy shit!

1533
00:58:03.203 --> 00:58:06.090
I just realized, Lionett wine.

1534
00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:07.922
We have that.

1535
00:58:07.922 --> 00:58:09.493
MARISHA: Yeah, we do.

1536
00:58:09.493 --> 00:58:10.390
LAURA: Wow.

1537
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:11.699
SAM: We do, what do you mean we do?

1538
00:58:11.699 --> 00:58:13.631
LAURA: I mean, we have that at home.

1539
00:58:13.631 --> 00:58:14.464
SAM: Oh, you have that at home,

1540
00:58:14.464 --> 00:58:17.012
we don't have it with us.
LAURA: Yeah, they sell it at the--

1541
00:58:17.012 --> 00:58:18.838
MARISHA: My family's wine.

1542
00:58:18.838 --> 00:58:19.671
SAM: Wow.

1543
00:58:19.671 --> 00:58:22.536
TRAVIS: Your family is like, a wine family?

1544
00:58:22.536 --> 00:58:24.568
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Wow.

1545
00:58:24.568 --> 00:58:25.900
LIAM: Well-off?

1546
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.265
MARISHA: Yep.

1547
00:58:27.265 --> 00:58:28.724
LIAM: Oh.

1548
00:58:28.724 --> 00:58:31.733
MARISHA: Dad was a poor bastard, and

1549
00:58:34.235 --> 00:58:39.226
he got a hint from someone

1550
00:58:39.226 --> 00:58:42.217
to go and buy property,

1551
00:58:42.217 --> 00:58:45.419
farm property that was more or less derelict,

1552
00:58:45.419 --> 00:58:47.513
couldn't get anything to grow on it,

1553
00:58:47.513 --> 00:58:51.479
and a fortune teller

1554
00:58:51.479 --> 00:58:54.518
told him to buy the property

1555
00:58:54.518 --> 00:58:59.245
and grow grapes on it, and that it would make him rich.

1556
00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:02.449
LAURA: Does he tell that story all the time?

1557
00:59:02.449 --> 00:59:05.261
SAM: Is it printed on the back of the label on the wine?

1558
00:59:05.261 --> 00:59:06.980
Because it's like--
MARISHA: No.

1559
00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.661
SAM: It's a cute story and tourists really love it?

1560
00:59:09.661 --> 00:59:14.661
MARISHA: He tries to keep it on the down-low.

1561
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.663
LIAM: Inside family lore.

1562
00:59:16.663 --> 00:59:18.788
MARISHA: Inside family lore.

1563
00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:20.900
TRAVIS: They're in Kamordah, and not in the hills

1564
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.451
that surround it, yes?

1565
00:59:22.451 --> 00:59:25.240
MARISHA: Well, the winery is based

1566
00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.921
on the north side of Kamordah, in the hills, yeah.

1567
00:59:27.921 --> 00:59:29.639
TALIESIN: Were they trying to be not seen?

1568
00:59:29.639 --> 00:59:30.904
They were trying to be quiet?

1569
00:59:30.904 --> 00:59:33.484
LAURA: They didn't, I mean, they had their hoods up.

1570
00:59:33.484 --> 00:59:35.810
MARISHA: Can I think of any reason why they would be

1571
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:37.146
in fucking Kamordah?

1572
00:59:37.146 --> 00:59:39.723
Is there anything there that would make them--

1573
00:59:39.723 --> 00:59:43.314
MATT: There's wine families,

1574
00:59:43.314 --> 00:59:45.355
there's a few competing ones there

1575
00:59:45.355 --> 00:59:47.967
that you're aware of, there are standard

1576
00:59:47.967 --> 00:59:51.109
small-scale businesses and guilds for any sort of,

1577
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:55.150
you know, town to be maintained and people to live there

1578
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:59.339
with the creature comforts that can keep a populous happy.

1579
00:59:59.339 --> 01:00:02.875
But it's not a political center,

1580
01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:05.488
there isn't a particular thing that stands out to you

1581
01:00:05.488 --> 01:00:08.332
as to having relevance to their journey.

1582
01:00:08.332 --> 01:00:11.332
TRAVIS: At this map, Deastok is the nearest large city,

1583
01:00:11.332 --> 01:00:12.391
it's south of there.

1584
01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:16.575
Is there any sort of Cobalt knowledge hub there?

1585
01:00:16.575 --> 01:00:17.819
MARISHA: I don't think so, in Deastok?

1586
01:00:17.819 --> 01:00:19.179
MATT: Deastok, mm-mm.

1587
01:00:19.179 --> 01:00:21.020
TRAVIS: They're traveling west from Zadash,

1588
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.019
the only thing further west from Kamordah

1589
01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:26.044
is the mountains, Pride's Call.

1590
01:00:27.892 --> 01:00:31.230
LIAM: Is there anything in known history

1591
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:35.930
that pre-dates the farming of the land for wine?

1592
01:00:39.232 --> 01:00:42.140
MATT: Based on your history check, I mean,

1593
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.995
there's a lot of things that pre-date this entire region.

1594
01:00:45.995 --> 01:00:50.378
As far as there being previously existing societies

1595
01:00:50.378 --> 01:00:53.090
that were wiped out during the Calamity,

1596
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.976
most of that information is still being recovered

1597
01:00:56.976 --> 01:01:01.016
via what ruins are beginning to be discovered

1598
01:01:01.016 --> 01:01:02.349
and delved into.

1599
01:01:03.899 --> 01:01:05.440
You know, much of--

1600
01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:12.099
much of the society that exists here, the Empire,

1601
01:01:12.099 --> 01:01:15.168
was based on a long-crashed,

1602
01:01:15.168 --> 01:01:19.580
Age of Arcanum mobile country, essentially,

1603
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.962
but nothing seems to really stand out to you

1604
01:01:22.962 --> 01:01:25.235
as far as specifically that location.

1605
01:01:25.235 --> 01:01:30.235
LIAM: Is there any reason you would not want to go there?

1606
01:01:30.368 --> 01:01:31.853
Just weighing our options.

1607
01:01:31.853 --> 01:01:33.947
I'm not saying I want to go there.

1608
01:01:33.947 --> 01:01:37.576
SAM: I think, if we're going to consider going there,

1609
01:01:37.576 --> 01:01:39.480
we need a little bit more hard proof

1610
01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.352
that is exactly where they were.

1611
01:01:41.352 --> 01:01:44.427
I mean, you said there's geysers all over the place, right?

1612
01:01:44.427 --> 01:01:46.083
LAURA: Not all over the place.

1613
01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:49.036
SAM: We should probably scry again tomorrow?

1614
01:01:49.036 --> 01:01:51.753
MARISHA: Do I know of any other place,
off the top of my head,

1615
01:01:51.753 --> 01:01:53.055
that would have geysers?

1616
01:01:53.055 --> 01:01:54.659
MATT: In the Empire?

1617
01:01:54.659 --> 01:01:56.495
Generally, no.

1618
01:01:56.495 --> 01:01:58.969
The region of Mount Mentiri and that part

1619
01:01:58.969 --> 01:02:01.419
of the mountain range there, the Cyrios Mountains,

1620
01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:04.623
is the stranger part of that area

1621
01:02:04.623 --> 01:02:06.198
because of the way it's changed the landscape.

1622
01:02:06.198 --> 01:02:07.554
Like north of that, Pride's Call,

1623
01:02:07.554 --> 01:02:09.313
while it's a different type of geothermal activity,

1624
01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:13.710
the hills and a lot of the plants that grow there

1625
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:15.241
are changed or different, which is how

1626
01:02:15.241 --> 01:02:17.945
a lot of that culture is based, especially the Pride silk

1627
01:02:17.945 --> 01:02:21.368
that is farmed from the silk worms that live there.

1628
01:02:21.368 --> 01:02:22.310
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1629
01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:27.237
MATT: But yeah, nothing in the Empire
that catches your mind.

1630
01:02:27.237 --> 01:02:31.082
As far as history goes, there are off-shoot places

1631
01:02:31.082 --> 01:02:36.082
near strange ocean thermal vents.

1632
01:02:36.407 --> 01:02:38.625
Those are, you know, you've heard of them,

1633
01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:40.731
but you don't know any specific locations
that you've traveled to.

1634
01:02:40.731 --> 01:02:43.870
LAURA: How long of a travel is it to get-- yeah.

1635
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:46.343
TRAVIS: It looks like a little bit longer than Zadash.

1636
01:02:46.343 --> 01:02:47.676
MARISHA: It's like--

1637
01:02:47.676 --> 01:02:49.944
MATT: Maybe like an extra day, day and a half to get there.

1638
01:02:49.944 --> 01:02:51.579
MARISHA: Yeah, it's like a day journey from Zadash to--

1639
01:02:51.579 --> 01:02:53.859
TRAVIS: Only because I'm map hunting,

1640
01:02:53.859 --> 01:02:56.851
and I'm only looking at things that are around the area.

1641
01:02:56.851 --> 01:03:01.189
Do either of you know about the ruins of Shattengrad?

1642
01:03:01.189 --> 01:03:03.399
MARISHA: Do I know about that?
LIAM: Do either of us know about that?

1643
01:03:03.399 --> 01:03:04.682
(laughter)

1644
01:03:04.682 --> 01:03:07.079
TRAVIS: Just east of Pride's Call, but north of Kamordah,

1645
01:03:07.079 --> 01:03:08.164
just on the other side of the--

1646
01:03:08.164 --> 01:03:09.925
MATT: Both of you make another history check for me, please.

1647
01:03:09.925 --> 01:03:12.091
MARISHA: Do I get advantage on this one too?

1648
01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:13.768
MATT: No.
LIAM: -- doing your thing?

1649
01:03:13.768 --> 01:03:16.101
TRAVIS: Guidance boost!
LAURA: Guidance!

1650
01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:19.225
TRAVIS: Because ruins are cool.

1651
01:03:19.225 --> 01:03:21.085
LIAM: Total balls for me. Five.

1652
01:03:21.085 --> 01:03:22.307
LAURA: Did you add the four?

1653
01:03:22.307 --> 01:03:23.761
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: (laughing)

1654
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:25.329
MARISHA: 17.
LIAM: No, it was a one.

1655
01:03:25.329 --> 01:03:26.162
LAURA: Oh.

1656
01:03:26.162 --> 01:03:27.778
MATT: Rolled 17?
MARISHA: 17 for me.

1657
01:03:27.778 --> 01:03:29.751
LIAM: Five.
MATT: Five, gotcha.

1658
01:03:29.751 --> 01:03:31.768
Yeah, the ruins of Shattengrad are--

1659
01:03:31.768 --> 01:03:33.827
LIAM: Oh, 15, I didn't add the 10.

1660
01:03:33.827 --> 01:03:37.910
MATT: Are a recent discovery outside of Pride's Call.

1661
01:03:40.019 --> 01:03:44.497
The beginnings it seemed to be some sort of a,

1662
01:03:44.497 --> 01:03:47.387
it would have been a quarry that's being built

1663
01:03:47.387 --> 01:03:49.623
by Pride's Call, some of the dwarves there,

1664
01:03:49.623 --> 01:03:52.561
the hill dwarves, and they found

1665
01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:56.509
some sort of a sinkhole, a like deep pit that went beneath,

1666
01:03:56.509 --> 01:03:58.727
and in the base there, there were elements

1667
01:03:58.727 --> 01:04:02.899
of very, very ancient ruin.

1668
01:04:02.899 --> 01:04:06.781
This is maybe a few decades ago.

1669
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:09.063
It's just been slowly being uncovered.

1670
01:04:09.063 --> 01:04:10.581
LAURA: Do you guys ever play Skyrim,

1671
01:04:10.581 --> 01:04:12.324
and then instead of following the storyline,

1672
01:04:12.324 --> 01:04:14.053
you just go to the interesting places.

1673
01:04:14.053 --> 01:04:15.667
TRAVIS: Fuck yes, of course.

1674
01:04:15.667 --> 01:04:18.820
LAURA: And you get all your fucking missions out of order?

1675
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.296
That's what I feel like what we're doing.

1676
01:04:20.296 --> 01:04:21.137
MARISHA: Kind of.

1677
01:04:21.137 --> 01:04:24.343
MATT: So you know of it, you don't know much more

1678
01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:26.984
beyond like what is in there, because it never

1679
01:04:26.984 --> 01:04:28.706
was something that you paid much mind to

1680
01:04:28.706 --> 01:04:29.860
when you were doing your research.

1681
01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.318
You just heard about it.

1682
01:04:31.318 --> 01:04:33.126
There were some excavations going on there.

1683
01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:35.176
It's less of a mysterious,

1684
01:04:35.176 --> 01:04:37.820
magical thing beneath there and more of historical interest,

1685
01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.005
and archeologists and you know, those type of folks

1686
01:04:41.005 --> 01:04:42.968
trying to figure out what exactly it was.

1687
01:04:42.968 --> 01:04:45.083
It seems to be, at least people are gathering

1688
01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:48.919
that it may be tied to-- what are you trying to do?

1689
01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:50.982
TRAVIS: Can I run an insight check on the DM?

1690
01:04:50.982 --> 01:04:52.757
MATT: You may not.

1691
01:04:52.757 --> 01:04:55.007
(laughter)

1692
01:04:56.024 --> 01:05:00.141
LIAM: Well, here is my concern about
going off on a goose chase.

1693
01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:04.100
We're talking about our prey.

1694
01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.058
They could be at a different--

1695
01:05:05.058 --> 01:05:06.352
They're more mobile than we are.

1696
01:05:06.352 --> 01:05:07.841
They could be in a different place in a day,

1697
01:05:07.841 --> 01:05:10.027
so it's going to take us many days to get there.

1698
01:05:10.027 --> 01:05:13.196
That trail will be cold as well, and we'll just be
guessing at a target.

1699
01:05:13.196 --> 01:05:17.247
At least if we're going to Zadash, we have some goals there,

1700
01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.626
things we can do.

1701
01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:20.871
LAURA: We can find out what they stole, maybe?

1702
01:05:20.871 --> 01:05:25.871
MARISHA: Potentially more about these ruins of Shattingrud?

1703
01:05:25.881 --> 01:05:27.454
TRAVIS: If their movement continues to be erratic,

1704
01:05:27.454 --> 01:05:29.835
then we know that they're at least moving with a purpose

1705
01:05:29.835 --> 01:05:31.840
to throw off our scent.

1706
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.673
LIAM: Yeah, while we travel.

1707
01:05:32.673 --> 01:05:34.531
LAURA: It's only a day away.

1708
01:05:35.823 --> 01:05:38.163
TRAVIS: ♪ It's only a day ♪

1709
01:05:38.163 --> 01:05:40.413
(laughter)

1710
01:05:41.533 --> 01:05:45.150
LAURA: ♪ Kamordah, Kamordah ♪
MARISHA: Scry on my parents maybe.

1711
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.767
SAM: Just to see if they're alive?

1712
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.769
MARISHA: Just check in on Kamordah, I guess.

1713
01:05:50.769 --> 01:05:51.602
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1714
01:05:51.602 --> 01:05:53.847
LAURA: I could try to send a message to them.

1715
01:05:53.847 --> 01:05:55.980
TRAVIS: You should.

1716
01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.320
SAM: You'd have to know what they look like
or something, right?

1717
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.360
LAURA: I have to be sort of familiar with them.

1718
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.721
MATT: Yeah, you have no familiarity with her parents at all.

1719
01:06:03.721 --> 01:06:06.937
LAURA: You could totally describe them,
and I know their name.

1720
01:06:06.937 --> 01:06:08.820
I don't know their name.

1721
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:11.672
I know that it's Lionel, but.

1722
01:06:11.672 --> 01:06:15.047
LIAM: Lionel Richie is correct.
LAURA: Lionel Richie is your dad.

1723
01:06:15.047 --> 01:06:17.728
SAM: Wait, that means you're--

1724
01:06:17.728 --> 01:06:18.662
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1725
01:06:18.662 --> 01:06:22.391
SAM: What's her name Richie, no, not Christina Ricci.

1726
01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:24.105
(laughter)

1727
01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:25.562
The girl with Paris Hilton.

1728
01:06:25.562 --> 01:06:27.047
LIAM: Nicole.
MARISHA and SAM: Nicole!

1729
01:06:27.047 --> 01:06:28.171
Nicole Richie!

1730
01:06:28.171 --> 01:06:30.028
(laughter)

1731
01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:32.025
That's right, I've been RPing as Nicole Richie

1732
01:06:32.025 --> 01:06:33.934
this whole time.

1733
01:06:33.934 --> 01:06:35.200
LIAM: Deep cover.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1734
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.402
TRAVIS: Wednesday Addams.

1735
01:06:36.402 --> 01:06:37.610
LAURA: That's hot.

1736
01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:38.836
That's your Traci persona.

1737
01:06:38.836 --> 01:06:40.705
MATT: I really don't want to have to make that canon.

1738
01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.903
(laughter)

1739
01:06:42.903 --> 01:06:44.552
MARISHA: I mean, it's the rich girl vibe,

1740
01:06:44.552 --> 01:06:46.499
that kind of works.
LIAM: I can see the pain on your face.

1741
01:06:46.499 --> 01:06:47.332
MATT: Yeah.

1742
01:06:47.332 --> 01:06:50.742
LAURA: So you can describe, and
I can try to send them a message,

1743
01:06:50.742 --> 01:06:55.339
or I can try to scry on them and see if they're okay.

1744
01:06:55.339 --> 01:06:57.357
TRAVIS: You have any ability to sketch?

1745
01:06:57.357 --> 01:06:58.190
LIAM: Do it right now.

1746
01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:00.284
Draw a picture of your parents.

1747
01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:02.100
LAURA: Here, no, you describe them to me

1748
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.983
and I'll try to draw a sketch, like a criminal thing.

1749
01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:07.831
You describe them and I'll try to draw

1750
01:07:07.831 --> 01:07:09.235
what I think they look like.

1751
01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:10.645
MATT: It's like a police sketch.

1752
01:07:10.645 --> 01:07:11.572
LAURA: Like a police sketch.

1753
01:07:11.572 --> 01:07:12.786
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right.

1754
01:07:12.786 --> 01:07:14.785
SAM: Face shape. Long, wide?

1755
01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:17.943
MARISHA: My dad's a little bit shorter, you know, he's got--

1756
01:07:17.943 --> 01:07:18.776
MATT: Make a charisma check.

1757
01:07:18.776 --> 01:07:20.895
MARISHA: Darker hair, a little pudgy,

1758
01:07:20.895 --> 01:07:22.732
but you know, like a rounded face,

1759
01:07:22.732 --> 01:07:25.378
he's got like a widow's peak.
TRAVIS: Charisma check.

1760
01:07:25.378 --> 01:07:27.897
MATT: This is how good you are about conveying the details.

1761
01:07:27.897 --> 01:07:29.766
MARISHA: He has brown eyes, I got my blue eyes from my mom.

1762
01:07:29.766 --> 01:07:31.466
Just straight charisma?

1763
01:07:31.466 --> 01:07:33.428
Natural 20!
LAURA: Woo!

1764
01:07:33.428 --> 01:07:34.436
SAM: Wow.
MATT: All right.

1765
01:07:34.436 --> 01:07:35.388
TALIESIN: First one.

1766
01:07:35.388 --> 01:07:39.225
MATT: Now you go ahead and make a dexterity check.

1767
01:07:39.225 --> 01:07:40.223
LAURA: Guide me.

1768
01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.545
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, you got it.

1769
01:07:41.545 --> 01:07:43.116
(laughter)

1770
01:07:43.116 --> 01:07:44.821
You can do it.

1771
01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:47.082
LAURA: I'm scared of all of them.

1772
01:07:47.082 --> 01:07:48.023
TRAVIS: Just pick it.
LIAM: Wait.

1773
01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:49.414
TRAVIS: Let it speak to you. Go.
LIAM: Wait.

1774
01:07:49.414 --> 01:07:52.576
A small little mote of white light
floats out from my hand--

1775
01:07:52.576 --> 01:07:54.402
(laughter)

1776
01:07:54.402 --> 01:07:56.842
LIAM: -- into you. Fortune's Favor.

1777
01:07:56.842 --> 01:07:57.675
(laughter)

1778
01:07:57.675 --> 01:07:59.195
MARISHA: Yeah.

1779
01:07:59.195 --> 01:08:00.777
LAURA: Okay.

1780
01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:01.712
Okay.

1781
01:08:01.712 --> 01:08:04.554
I should just use it right now, just in case?

1782
01:08:04.554 --> 01:08:05.990
Woo!

1783
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:07.103
Plus dexterity?

1784
01:08:07.103 --> 01:08:08.059
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1785
01:08:08.059 --> 01:08:10.788
LAURA: That's 22, but I'm going to try the advantage.

1786
01:08:10.788 --> 01:08:12.338
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

1787
01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.977
LAURA: Okay, 22.

1788
01:08:13.977 --> 01:08:15.085
MATT: Okay.

1789
01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.629
It's not bad.

1790
01:08:18.629 --> 01:08:21.109
I mean it's, you know-- given the circumstances

1791
01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:23.741
that you're literally just describing out of thin air

1792
01:08:23.741 --> 01:08:25.554
and she sketches it, you can look at it and go like:

1793
01:08:25.554 --> 01:08:27.021
Yeah, there's some things there that

1794
01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:29.064
have a bit of familiarity to it.
LAURA: Do you want me to-- eyes farther apart,

1795
01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:30.698
closer together?

1796
01:08:30.698 --> 01:08:32.303
MARISHA: He's got like a unibrow

1797
01:08:32.303 --> 01:08:36.108
that he's let go in his later years.

1798
01:08:36.108 --> 01:08:38.674
LAURA: The shape of his lips, is it close to your lips?

1799
01:08:38.674 --> 01:08:41.228
MARISHA: Yeah, the lips are, yeah, almondy shaped, yeah.

1800
01:08:41.228 --> 01:08:42.223
TRAVIS: Natural frown, yeah.

1801
01:08:42.223 --> 01:08:45.254
MARISHA: Yeah, he's cranky like me.

1802
01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.087
LAURA: Okay.

1803
01:08:46.978 --> 01:08:47.909
MATT: All right.

1804
01:08:47.909 --> 01:08:50.675
You have a sketch

1805
01:08:50.675 --> 01:08:53.540
of her father.
LAURA: And his name is...?

1806
01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.829
MARISHA: Thoreau, Thoreau Lionett.

1807
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:56.892
SAM: Thoreau-regard?

1808
01:08:56.892 --> 01:08:58.145
MARISHA: Thoreau.

1809
01:08:58.145 --> 01:08:59.888
(clapping)
(laughter)

1810
01:08:59.888 --> 01:09:01.487
MARISHA: That's why when you made that joke forever ago

1811
01:09:01.487 --> 01:09:03.332
I was like: Oh, fuck.

1812
01:09:03.332 --> 01:09:05.352
TRAVIS: Wow, you nailed it with the joke.

1813
01:09:05.352 --> 01:09:07.972
MARISHA: Thoreau Lionett.
LAURA: Thoreau.

1814
01:09:07.972 --> 01:09:09.571
Okay, am I scrying or am I sending a message,

1815
01:09:09.571 --> 01:09:10.404
what am I doing here?

1816
01:09:10.404 --> 01:09:11.237
LIAM: What's with you with the names?

1817
01:09:11.237 --> 01:09:13.233
SAM: I know, I pulled yours out, too.

1818
01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:15.490
LAURA: Send a message to Thoreau.

1819
01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:17.886
TALIESIN: That way if nothing's happened yet, you can--

1820
01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:19.785
LAURA: He won't know it's me, he's never met me.

1821
01:09:19.785 --> 01:09:21.761
LIAM: He won't know-regard.

1822
01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:23.662
TRAVIS: Oh, you stop it.
TALIESIN: Are we back there?

1823
01:09:23.662 --> 01:09:26.125
LAURA: I don't even have to say I have
anything to do with you if you want.

1824
01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:27.709
I can just be a creepy voice in his head

1825
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:30.428
and make sure he's okay.

1826
01:09:30.428 --> 01:09:34.700
I can make him think he's going crazy, if you want, but.

1827
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.200
MARISHA: He would probably relish it.

1828
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:40.641
You could always say that you're with the Cobalt Soul

1829
01:09:40.641 --> 01:09:44.173
checking in, giving a status on Beauregard.

1830
01:09:44.173 --> 01:09:45.006
LAURA: Okay.

1831
01:09:45.006 --> 01:09:47.450
Should I say you're doing like super, super good?

1832
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.582
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

1833
01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:51.141
MARISHA: You can tell him I'm an expositor now.
LAURA: Okay.

1834
01:09:51.141 --> 01:09:52.265
MARISHA: Top of the class.

1835
01:09:52.265 --> 01:09:55.609
SAM: That's a lot of stuff to-- okay.
TRAVIS: You got it.

1836
01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:58.344
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Thoreau-regard.

1837
01:09:58.344 --> 01:10:00.261
MARISHA: Make sure you like, ask him if anything

1838
01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:01.420
has happened in Kamordah.

1839
01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.913
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
SAM: All of those things.

1840
01:10:03.913 --> 01:10:04.898
MATT: All right.

1841
01:10:04.898 --> 01:10:06.364
TALIESIN: Ready.
MARISHA: Fuck.

1842
01:10:08.256 --> 01:10:09.472
LAURA: (low voice) Hello.

1843
01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:14.728
It is I, Archivist Zeenoth, letting you know

1844
01:10:16.303 --> 01:10:20.346
Beauregard is an expositor now.

1845
01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:22.596
(laughter)

1846
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.247
Top of her class.

1847
01:10:26.247 --> 01:10:27.968
How are things there?

1848
01:10:27.968 --> 01:10:29.264
(laughter)

1849
01:10:29.264 --> 01:10:30.898
Anything weird happen?

1850
01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:31.858
TRAVIS: Anything weird?

1851
01:10:31.858 --> 01:10:33.458
LAURA: No, no, anything is one word.

1852
01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:35.708
(laughter)

1853
01:10:39.854 --> 01:10:41.187
SAM: This poor guy.

1854
01:10:42.048 --> 01:10:43.645
He's doing the crossword.

1855
01:10:43.645 --> 01:10:45.439
(laughter)

1856
01:10:45.439 --> 01:10:46.272
TRAVIS: On the toilet?

1857
01:10:46.272 --> 01:10:47.913
MATT: No, the response is,

1858
01:10:47.913 --> 01:10:49.171
"Uh, ah--

1859
01:10:50.929 --> 01:10:52.785
"all right.

1860
01:10:52.785 --> 01:10:55.285
"Th-thank you for the information.

1861
01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:57.072
"Wow.

1862
01:10:58.189 --> 01:11:00.280
"Goo-good, good for her.

1863
01:11:03.714 --> 01:11:06.221
"Nothing--

1864
01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:08.137
"nothing to report?

1865
01:11:09.387 --> 01:11:10.720
"Things are fine.

1866
01:11:13.489 --> 01:11:15.244
"Is that how this works? Is--"

1867
01:11:15.244 --> 01:11:17.670
(laughter)

1868
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.178
LIAM: Floosh.

1869
01:11:20.934 --> 01:11:23.285
LAURA: Number one, he sounded really nervous.

1870
01:11:23.285 --> 01:11:26.000
Number two, he sounded impressed.

1871
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.169
MARISHA: Really?

1872
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:29.449
LAURA: Yeah, he said "good for her."
MARISHA: Good for me?

1873
01:11:29.449 --> 01:11:31.941
MATT: Like the grandparent trying to turn off FaceTime.

1874
01:11:31.941 --> 01:11:32.966
"How do I--?"

1875
01:11:32.966 --> 01:11:35.592
LAURA: Number three, he said nothing weird has happened.

1876
01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:37.522
And then I heard him fart.

1877
01:11:37.522 --> 01:11:39.480
MARISHA: Oh!

1878
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.233
Sounds about right.

1879
01:11:41.233 --> 01:11:43.687
All right, cool, great, we don't have to go to Kamordah.

1880
01:11:43.687 --> 01:11:44.819
SAM: To Zadash!

1881
01:11:44.819 --> 01:11:45.652
MARISHA: Yeah.

1882
01:11:45.652 --> 01:11:46.876
TRAVIS: To sleep!

1883
01:11:46.876 --> 01:11:49.183
(laughter)

1884
01:11:49.183 --> 01:11:50.625
MATT: All right, so you guys rest for the evening.

1885
01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:51.458
SAM: Mm-hmm.

1886
01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:53.727
MATT: Who's keeping watch on this one?

1887
01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:54.801
All right.

1888
01:11:54.801 --> 01:11:56.908
Just roll a perception check for me, if you don't mind.

1889
01:11:56.908 --> 01:11:59.575
TRAVIS: I'll give him advantage.

1890
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:03.025
LIAM: 17.

1891
01:12:03.025 --> 01:12:04.726
MATT: 17, okay.
SAM: Triple advantage.

1892
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.675
MATT: Evening goes by without issue.

1893
01:12:08.675 --> 01:12:10.663
I'll say for the purposes of expediency,

1894
01:12:10.663 --> 01:12:12.389
since this is a long journey, than having to roll

1895
01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:14.187
for every single section of your night,

1896
01:12:14.187 --> 01:12:16.056
I'm just going to go with a general roll for it.

1897
01:12:16.056 --> 01:12:17.054
LIAM: There's a dome every night as well.

1898
01:12:17.054 --> 01:12:18.809
MATT: Of course.

1899
01:12:18.809 --> 01:12:20.127
(clears throat)

1900
01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:21.808
Continuing onward for the next bit of your journey,

1901
01:12:21.808 --> 01:12:23.451
you make your way to Trostenwald.

1902
01:12:23.451 --> 01:12:25.182
Do you wish to stop there for any particular reason?

1903
01:12:25.182 --> 01:12:26.699
SAM: We've been there before.
MARISHA: Bryce?

1904
01:12:26.699 --> 01:12:28.382
MATT: Bryce is Alfield.

1905
01:12:28.382 --> 01:12:29.591
MARISHA: Oh, Alfield.

1906
01:12:29.591 --> 01:12:30.924
TRAVIS: Which is on the way, but I think we should--

1907
01:12:30.924 --> 01:12:33.398
LAURA: Just get like, food for our horses

1908
01:12:33.398 --> 01:12:35.273
and yeah, keep going fast.

1909
01:12:35.273 --> 01:12:36.106
MATT: Okay.

1910
01:12:36.106 --> 01:12:38.920
If you decide to stay the night for comfortable lodging

1911
01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.703
and not on the road least, you can go ahead and mark off

1912
01:12:43.886 --> 01:12:48.604
three and a half gold, three gold for all of you, for--

1913
01:12:48.604 --> 01:12:50.221
LAURA: Okay, I'll do that.
MATT: For modest--

1914
01:12:50.221 --> 01:12:51.197
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester.

1915
01:12:51.197 --> 01:12:52.733
LAURA: You're welcome.

1916
01:12:52.733 --> 01:12:55.219
MARISHA: Gustav, is that his name?

1917
01:12:55.219 --> 01:12:56.604
Leader of the circus?

1918
01:12:56.604 --> 01:12:57.437
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1919
01:12:57.437 --> 01:12:59.007
MARISHA: I wonder how his life is doing.

1920
01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.641
Maybe we can check in.

1921
01:13:00.641 --> 01:13:03.770
TALIESIN: He would've already left, though.

1922
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:05.274
MATT: You definitely don't see him in Trostenwald

1923
01:13:05.274 --> 01:13:06.721
while you're there.

1924
01:13:06.721 --> 01:13:09.479
LIAM: It's been a long time in California.

1925
01:13:09.479 --> 01:13:12.212
This is the inn that we would have met in, right?

1926
01:13:12.212 --> 01:13:14.278
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Oh, wow.

1927
01:13:14.278 --> 01:13:16.073
MARISHA: Aww.
LAURA: Aww.

1928
01:13:16.073 --> 01:13:18.424
TRAVIS: Oh, for fuck's sake.
SAM: Oh, that's right.

1929
01:13:18.424 --> 01:13:19.455
(laughter)

1930
01:13:19.455 --> 01:13:20.928
We sat at that table over there.

1931
01:13:20.928 --> 01:13:24.580
LAURA: Oh, we need to have a drink for Molly, and Yasha.

1932
01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:28.428
MARISHA: I think I also-- didn't we
make dick carvings under the table?

1933
01:13:28.428 --> 01:13:30.059
LAURA: (gasps)
MARISHA: We go over and we--

1934
01:13:30.059 --> 01:13:31.444
LAURA: Like crawl on hands and knees and look under--

1935
01:13:31.444 --> 01:13:34.924
MATT: Make an investigation check, each of you.
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

1936
01:13:34.924 --> 01:13:37.353
LAURA: Guidance!
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1937
01:13:37.353 --> 01:13:38.186
On me or you?

1938
01:13:38.186 --> 01:13:39.847
LAURA: I was doing it on myself.

1939
01:13:39.847 --> 01:13:42.540
MATT: I don't know if you can--
can you do Guidance on yourself?

1940
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.039
LIAM: I think you can. TJ Storm did it
like a motherfucker at this table.

1941
01:13:45.039 --> 01:13:46.635
MATT: You touch one willing creature.
You are a willing creature, yep.

1942
01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:48.327
LAURA: I am.
MATT: Just making sure.

1943
01:13:48.327 --> 01:13:49.551
MARISHA: 18.

1944
01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:51.245
LIAM: 26, I'm looking for the dicks as well.

1945
01:13:51.245 --> 01:13:52.078
LAURA: 14.

1946
01:13:52.078 --> 01:13:53.552
TALIESIN: Just can't use it if
you have a concentration spell up.

1947
01:13:53.552 --> 01:13:57.135
MATT: You all come to the table at the same time
and have the the same exact epiphany

1948
01:13:57.135 --> 01:13:58.699
as you see the carvings are still there.

1949
01:13:58.699 --> 01:14:00.661
LIAM: Dicks!
MARISHA: (gasps) Dicks!

1950
01:14:00.661 --> 01:14:05.216
MATT: There's an old farmer guy who's like, "What?!

1951
01:14:05.216 --> 01:14:07.891
"Who are you calling a dick?"

1952
01:14:07.891 --> 01:14:09.638
MARISHA: You, old man. Shut up!

1953
01:14:09.638 --> 01:14:11.785
MATT: "Oh, piece of shit."

1954
01:14:11.785 --> 01:14:13.490
TRAVIS: Just a table inspector. We're just coming through

1955
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:15.727
making sure all your furniture is up to code.

1956
01:14:15.727 --> 01:14:17.128
MATT: "Learn some manners."

1957
01:14:17.128 --> 01:14:19.748
TRAVIS: Congratulations, it is.
LAURA: I'm going to add a Tusktooth to it.

1958
01:14:19.748 --> 01:14:22.206
MARISHA: What, he's an asshole.

1959
01:14:22.206 --> 01:14:24.104
LAURA: I'm going to add a Tusktooth to it.

1960
01:14:24.104 --> 01:14:25.782
TALIESIN: Just accosted a local.
MATT: Okay.

1961
01:14:25.782 --> 01:14:26.667
(laughter)

1962
01:14:26.667 --> 01:14:27.866
It's on brand.

1963
01:14:27.866 --> 01:14:29.811
LAURA: And we should have a drink.

1964
01:14:29.811 --> 01:14:31.056
MARISHA: I agree.

1965
01:14:31.056 --> 01:14:32.410
LAURA: For Molly.

1966
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:36.389
SAM: Let's have some Baumbauch Brewery ale.

1967
01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:37.909
MARISHA: The fucking Baumbauchs.

1968
01:14:37.909 --> 01:14:38.995
TRAVIS: They suck.

1969
01:14:38.995 --> 01:14:40.251
MARISHA: Yeah.

1970
01:14:40.251 --> 01:14:41.312
LAURA: What did I write?

1971
01:14:41.312 --> 01:14:43.208
I changed their name.

1972
01:14:43.208 --> 01:14:44.368
On the sign.

LAURA: Bumcock, maybe?

1975
01:14:47.059 --> 01:14:48.331
I can't remember.
TALIESIN: That's pretty funny.

LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

Yorda's like-- sorry, looking for my old notes

2009

LIAM: Is that all of the breweries?

2015
01:16:06.874 --> 01:16:08.234
What about von Brandt?

2016
01:16:08.234 --> 01:16:09.498
MATT: "No, just the Baumbauchs."

2017
01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:11.164
LAURA: (gasping) What happened to them?

2018
01:16:11.164 --> 01:16:12.854
MATT: "Apparently they were caught up

2021
01:16:17.077 --> 01:16:19.434
MARISHA: I stole their fucking letters and shit,

2022
01:16:19.434 --> 01:16:20.903
they were smuggling drugs.
SAM: And you exposed 'em!

2023

2030
01:16:31.492 --> 01:16:32.325
MARISHA: Huh?

2031
01:16:32.325 --> 01:16:33.411
Helped who corner the market?

2032
01:16:33.411 --> 01:16:34.619
SAM: The other one.
MARISHA: The other one?

2033
01:16:34.619 --> 01:16:36.474
MATT: There are two other families there.

2034
01:16:36.474 --> 01:16:38.665
"So I can definitely get it for you,

2035
01:16:38.665 --> 01:16:40.878
"so you know, it's probably going to be quite pricey."

2036
01:16:40.878 --> 01:16:43.078
MARISHA: Do you have any Lionett wine?

2037
01:16:44.372 --> 01:16:47.324
MATT: "Yeah, I think we got two bottles in there."
MARISHA: I'll buy 'em both.

2038
01:16:47.324 --> 01:16:48.734
LIAM: Let's do that, are you saving up?

2039
01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:50.596
MATT: "All right, you're spending the money.

2040
01:16:50.596 --> 01:16:52.057
"Certainly, by all means."

2041
01:16:52.057 --> 01:16:54.200
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll spend the money.

2042
01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.262
MATT: All right, so for the Lionett,

2043
01:16:56.262 --> 01:16:58.264
they have two bottles of the purple cider red wine,

2044
01:16:58.264 --> 01:16:59.412
which you're very familiar with,

2045
01:16:59.412 --> 01:17:00.744
those run 50 gold per bottle.

2046
01:17:00.744 --> 01:17:01.577
(whistles)

2047
01:17:01.577 --> 01:17:03.786
So 100 gold for the two bottles they have.

2048
01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:04.619
MARISHA: Yep.

2049
01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:08.601
TRAVIS: Whoa, your family rolls in the stanky yankee shit.

2050
01:17:08.601 --> 01:17:09.450
(laughter)

2051
01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:10.583
Oh my god!

2052
01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.676
MARISHA: Made some really good money
when I was smuggling it out

2053
01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:15.185
and selling it for half cost on the black market.

2054
01:17:15.185 --> 01:17:16.019
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2055
01:17:16.019 --> 01:17:18.215
MARISHA: Now you know why.

2056
01:17:18.215 --> 01:17:21.906
All right, I actually give 100 gold to my family.

2057
01:17:24.038 --> 01:17:26.023
Oops, oops, oops.

2058
01:17:26.023 --> 01:17:28.240
TALIESIN: It's actually not wholesale, so really you're--

2059
01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.680
TRAVIS: It's just grapes, fermented grapes, yes?

2060
01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.388
There's no, I don't know, spice in the bottle?

2061
01:17:35.388 --> 01:17:37.693
LIAM: A large part of the wine industry is perception,

2062
01:17:37.693 --> 01:17:40.506
you know, you create sort of an oeuvre.

2063
01:17:40.506 --> 01:17:41.701
(laughter)

2064
01:17:41.701 --> 01:17:43.246
MARISHA: You have to--
LIAM: It's experiential.

2065
01:17:43.246 --> 01:17:46.130
MARISHA: It's an art. It's like a storytelling device

2066
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:48.072
when you have it done the right way.

2067
01:17:48.072 --> 01:17:50.565
MATT: "I'm going to be honest, I don't see it myself,

2068
01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:51.972
"but it sells well.

2069
01:17:51.972 --> 01:17:53.744
"Most folks that really, you know,

2070
01:17:53.744 --> 01:17:55.875
"look deep into it tend to be kind of,

2071
01:17:55.875 --> 01:17:57.185
"I don't know, not right in the head."

2072
01:17:57.185 --> 01:17:59.568
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, pricks.
SAM: (laughs)

2073
01:18:00.692 --> 01:18:02.459
LAURA: I'll try some.

2074
01:18:02.459 --> 01:18:03.382
MARISHA: All right.
LAURA: Since it's your wine.

2075
01:18:03.382 --> 01:18:04.776
TALIESIN: I'll try some, too.

2076
01:18:04.776 --> 01:18:05.627
MARISHA: Really?

2077
01:18:05.627 --> 01:18:09.129
TRAVIS: Yeah, I need to know what a 50 gold
bottle of wine tastes like.

2078
01:18:09.129 --> 01:18:10.139
TALIESIN: Very special occasion.

2079
01:18:10.139 --> 01:18:14.103
LIAM: Caduceus, this is where the rest of us met.

2080
01:18:14.103 --> 01:18:15.436
TALIESIN: Really?
LIAM: Yeah.

2081
01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:17.420
Yeah, a long time ago now.

2082
01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.177
TALIESIN: Explains the dick carvings.

2083
01:18:19.177 --> 01:18:21.210
That's really nice.

2084
01:18:22.444 --> 01:18:23.678
It's a nice little place.

2085
01:18:23.678 --> 01:18:24.999
LIAM: It's nice that we could show it to you.

2086
01:18:24.999 --> 01:18:27.468
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm happy to be here.

2087
01:18:27.468 --> 01:18:31.072
LIAM: Notch in history of the Mighty Nein.

2088
01:18:31.072 --> 01:18:33.838
MARISHA: I pour out some wine for everybody.

2089
01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:34.788
SAM: Hmm.

2090
01:18:34.788 --> 01:18:37.218
TRAVIS: Does it change colors?

2091
01:18:37.218 --> 01:18:38.478
Do anything--

2092
01:18:38.478 --> 01:18:41.232
MATT: It looks like a nice rich red-purple wine.

2093
01:18:41.232 --> 01:18:42.815
TRAVIS: Okay, cool, cool.

2094
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:45.408
SAM: Monkey?

2095
01:18:45.408 --> 01:18:48.160
LAURA: No, monk.
SAM: Oh, monk.

2096
01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.966
I'm just looking at her-- the first time she ever wrote

2097
01:18:49.966 --> 01:18:52.066
notes about our characters in her notebook.

2098
01:18:52.066 --> 01:18:52.899
MARISHA: Aww.

2099
01:18:52.899 --> 01:18:54.992
LAURA: Caleb, stinky wizard.

2100
01:18:54.992 --> 01:18:56.311
Nott, goblin girl.

2101
01:18:56.311 --> 01:18:58.307
Molly, pretty tiefling guy.

2102
01:18:58.307 --> 01:18:59.140
TALIESIN: Hmm.

2103
01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.551
LAURA: Yasha, pale Viking.

2104
01:19:00.551 --> 01:19:02.000
Beau, monkey.

2105
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.185
(laughter)

2106
01:19:03.185 --> 01:19:05.742
Fjord, half-orc cowboy.

2107
01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:07.705
(laughter)

2108
01:19:07.705 --> 01:19:10.661
MARISHA: Wow, that's right, last time
we were here, you were a cowboy.

2109
01:19:10.661 --> 01:19:12.144
TRAVIS: I was never a--

2110
01:19:12.144 --> 01:19:14.910
LAURA: You were a cowboy.
You were a definite cowboy.

2111
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:17.262
LIAM: Why isn't he a cowboy now?

2112
01:19:17.262 --> 01:19:18.791
SAM: This is lovely.

2113
01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:20.740
MARISHA: It's not bad, right?
SAM: Yes.

2114
01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.298
MARISHA: I know it's like all bullshit,

2115
01:19:22.298 --> 01:19:23.894
but it's actually pretty fucking good wine.

2116
01:19:23.894 --> 01:19:24.769
SAM: It's fruit-forward.

2117
01:19:24.769 --> 01:19:25.927
(laughter)

2118
01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:28.356
MARISHA: You get those mineral tastes, yeah.

2119
01:19:28.356 --> 01:19:31.886
TRAVIS: I hear if you swirl it in your glass, it helps to--

2120
01:19:31.886 --> 01:19:33.155
what are you doing?

2121
01:19:33.155 --> 01:19:34.363
SAM: (spits)

2122
01:19:34.363 --> 01:19:37.145
MATT: It is surprisingly zesty with like a faint hint

2123
01:19:37.145 --> 01:19:38.218
of cinnamon to it.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2124
01:19:38.218 --> 01:19:40.268
MATT: Which is where the cider comes from, the title cider.

2125
01:19:40.268 --> 01:19:42.087
SAM: It's funny, I'm getting notes

2126
01:19:42.087 --> 01:19:44.561
of tobacco and jam in it, actually.

2127
01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:45.959
A little dark cherry.

2128
01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:48.973
MARISHA: Well, that's from that volcanic-type soil

2129
01:19:48.973 --> 01:19:50.395
that's there, from--

2130
01:19:50.395 --> 01:19:51.653
LAURA: I taste sulfur.

2131
01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:54.273
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, from the geysers, mm-hmm.

2132
01:19:54.273 --> 01:19:55.645
SAM: To Zadash!

2133
01:19:55.645 --> 01:19:58.420
(laughter)

2134
01:19:59.899 --> 01:20:00.732
MATT: All right.

2135
01:20:00.732 --> 01:20:03.607
MARISHA: This has just been an episode
of cutting conversations and going.

2136
01:20:03.607 --> 01:20:04.755
(laughter)

2137
01:20:04.755 --> 01:20:06.965
MATT: All right, you stay your night there in Trostenwald

2138
01:20:06.965 --> 01:20:09.105
and continue the next day.

2139
01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:14.105
It's about two days from there, I believe, to Alfield.

2140
01:20:16.952 --> 01:20:18.804
Is there anything you wish to do along the journey there,

2141
01:20:18.804 --> 01:20:20.167
these two days?

2142
01:20:20.167 --> 01:20:21.429
TRAVIS: No.
MATT: Okay.

2143
01:20:21.429 --> 01:20:22.496
TRAVIS: Travel hard.

2144
01:20:22.496 --> 01:20:25.676
LAURA: Just really petting Sprinkle a lot.

2145
01:20:25.676 --> 01:20:26.509
MATT: Okay.

2146
01:20:26.509 --> 01:20:27.970
MARISHA: Oh, we continue to work out.

2147
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:28.803
MATT: Totally.

2148
01:20:28.803 --> 01:20:30.529
TRAVIS: Hanging from branches, doing pull-ups.

2149
01:20:30.529 --> 01:20:31.962
MATT: You find the occasional tree and just really--

2150
01:20:31.962 --> 01:20:34.581
TRAVIS: Tossing boulders back and forth as we do sit-ups.

2151
01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:36.375
MARISHA: High-running.

2152
01:20:36.375 --> 01:20:39.382
TRAVIS: Oh, high knees, high knees, drop down, pop back up.

2153
01:20:39.382 --> 01:20:41.994
MATT: (laughs) Perfect.

2154
01:20:41.994 --> 01:20:44.029
SAM: The equivalent of me tasting wine.

2155
01:20:44.029 --> 01:20:46.279
(laughter)

2156
01:20:47.895 --> 01:20:50.388
Just as boring to me to watch you do that.

2157
01:20:50.388 --> 01:20:53.119
(laughter)

2158
01:20:53.119 --> 01:20:56.001
MATT: Eventually making your way to the outside of Alfield.

2159
01:20:56.001 --> 01:20:59.651
The city has-- and Trostenwald had it, too,

2160
01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:02.709
a minor Righteous Brand presence, which previously,

2161
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:04.571
especially when you grew up here in this area,

2162
01:21:04.571 --> 01:21:09.571
Righteous Brand stayed mostly to outskirt outposts,

2163
01:21:09.654 --> 01:21:14.654
like the two garrisons to the east of the Wuyun Gorge,

2164
01:21:14.738 --> 01:21:18.062
and major cities like Zadash and Rexxentrum,

2165
01:21:18.062 --> 01:21:19.793
Bladegarden, which is where most

2166
01:21:19.793 --> 01:21:22.349
of the training there happens, so it's a little strange.

2167
01:21:22.349 --> 01:21:24.581
When you came through last time on your way to Felderwin

2168
01:21:24.581 --> 01:21:26.104
after the war began, you remembered seeing

2169
01:21:26.104 --> 01:21:28.114
more of a presence there, so the presence is still there.

2170
01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:29.042
LIAM: Martial law.

2171
01:21:29.042 --> 01:21:31.198
MATT: Yeah, well, I wouldn't say martial law necessarily,

2172
01:21:31.198 --> 01:21:33.690
but there's definitely a larger martial presence.

2173
01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:36.698
Nevertheless, you have access to the city,

2174
01:21:36.698 --> 01:21:38.642
and you go ahead and find yourself the previous inn

2175
01:21:38.642 --> 01:21:40.253
where you had stayed.

2176
01:21:40.253 --> 01:21:42.695
SAM: In Zadash?
MATT: No, you're in Alfield.

2177
01:21:42.695 --> 01:21:45.299
LIAM: (as Nott) To Zadash!
SAM: To Zadash!

2178
01:21:45.299 --> 01:21:46.749
MARISHA: (laughing)

2179
01:21:47.766 --> 01:21:52.487
MATT: You do ask around for Watchmaster Bryce Feelid.

2180
01:21:52.487 --> 01:21:56.416
However, they are not there. They have been

2181
01:21:56.416 --> 01:22:00.508
relocated for the time being to Bladegarden

2182
01:22:00.508 --> 01:22:03.291
to aid in the current conflict until further notice.

2183
01:22:03.291 --> 01:22:04.524
TRAVIS: Way east.

2184
01:22:04.524 --> 01:22:05.473
LAURA: Yeah.

2185
01:22:05.473 --> 01:22:08.264
Oh, Bryce did not want to go there.

2186
01:22:08.264 --> 01:22:09.948
MARISHA: No.
TRAVIS: No, they did not.

2187
01:22:09.948 --> 01:22:11.955
LIAM: What about the fire damage here?

2188
01:22:11.955 --> 01:22:13.565
Is that all--?

2189
01:22:13.565 --> 01:22:18.344
MATT: Most of it's been-- it's either in a state of repair,

2190
01:22:18.344 --> 01:22:20.649
some of the smaller buildings, the damage has been

2191
01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:22.109
completely taken care of.

2192
01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:25.798
Like the larger buildings, like the Candle something,

2193
01:22:25.798 --> 01:22:27.444
I can't remember off the top of my head,

2194
01:22:27.444 --> 01:22:29.090
is still in the process of being constructed,

2195
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:31.124
because that was a major point of damage.

2196
01:22:31.124 --> 01:22:32.657
It looks like the city's recovering

2197
01:22:32.657 --> 01:22:34.664
and is on the cusp of being completely recovered

2198
01:22:34.664 --> 01:22:37.268
from that attack by the gnolls back in the day,

2199
01:22:37.268 --> 01:22:38.768
a few months back.

2200
01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.869
You find yourselves there comfortably.

2201
01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:45.174
For another evening of sleep, this'll be,

2202
01:22:45.174 --> 01:22:47.457
we'll put for all of you--

2203
01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:51.195
are you all going-- staying in separate rooms?

2204
01:22:51.195 --> 01:22:52.286
They're a little smaller here.

2205
01:22:52.286 --> 01:22:53.725
Are you all sharing rooms again here?

2206
01:22:53.725 --> 01:22:54.610
SAM: Double up.

2207
01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:55.570
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: We'll double up.

2208
01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.624
MATT: Okay, that'll put you at nine silver.

2209
01:22:57.624 --> 01:22:58.708
TALIESIN: I got that.

2210
01:22:58.708 --> 01:22:59.541
MATT: You got it?

2211
01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:00.374
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2212
01:23:00.374 --> 01:23:01.632
MATT: All righty.

2213
01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:07.797
SAM: Ask around, any sign of Shakäste around these parts?

2214
01:23:07.797 --> 01:23:10.925
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2215
01:23:10.925 --> 01:23:11.986
SAM: Guidance!

2216
01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:13.296
Six.

2217
01:23:13.296 --> 01:23:14.617
This is investigation?

2218
01:23:14.617 --> 01:23:15.450
MATT: Yeah.

2219
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:16.283
SAM: 17.

2220
01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:17.700
MATT: 17, all righty.

2221
01:23:19.454 --> 01:23:23.294
There's been no information of Shakäste

2222
01:23:23.294 --> 01:23:26.222
currently being there, but apparently a week ago,

2223
01:23:26.222 --> 01:23:31.222
there was mention, some say of the mysterious figure

2224
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:34.390
known as Hush passing through briefly.

2225
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:35.674
Asking around some of the common folk

2226
01:23:35.674 --> 01:23:37.742
and they light up at the mention of the name.

2227
01:23:37.742 --> 01:23:39.679
MARISHA: (laughing)

2228
01:23:40.571 --> 01:23:41.717
MATT: Every week.

2229
01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:42.947
MARISHA: Oh!

2230
01:23:42.947 --> 01:23:45.321
Oh, right in my coffee!

2231
01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:47.265
TRAVIS: Shake it up, shake it up.
MARISHA: It's dead!

2232
01:23:47.265 --> 01:23:49.500
MATT: No no, it's--
MARISHA: It's in my coffee!

2233
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.235
(laughter)

2234
01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:52.576
LIAM: (whispers) Shakäste.

2235
01:23:52.576 --> 01:23:55.126
(laughter)

2236
01:23:57.202 --> 01:23:58.866
TRAVIS: How are you feeling, friend?

2237
01:23:58.866 --> 01:23:59.775
(laughter)

2238
01:23:59.775 --> 01:24:00.984
Only one way out now.

2239
01:24:00.984 --> 01:24:02.339
That's actually sad.

2240
01:24:02.339 --> 01:24:04.473
LAURA: Is it dead?

2241
01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:05.798
Oh, buzzed.

2242
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.790
He's really energetic, though.

2243
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:10.602
MATT: Should probably remove that from the table

2244
01:24:10.602 --> 01:24:11.988
so you don't accidentally drink it.

2245
01:24:11.988 --> 01:24:15.128
TRAVIS: Max, come dispose of this beautiful creature.

2246
01:24:15.128 --> 01:24:17.372
(laughter)

2247
01:24:17.372 --> 01:24:18.918
TALIESIN: Tasteful funeral.

2248
01:24:18.918 --> 01:24:21.168
(laughter)

2249
01:24:22.046 --> 01:24:23.129
MATT: Anyway.

2250
01:24:23.129 --> 01:24:25.499
SAM: So Hush was around at some point?

2251
01:24:25.499 --> 01:24:28.045
MATT: At some point in the past week or so, passing through.

2252
01:24:28.045 --> 01:24:30.628
MARISHA: At the inn, are there any--

2253
01:24:32.061 --> 01:24:34.427
any notices on the post board,

2254
01:24:34.427 --> 01:24:36.648
anything that looks interesting?

2255
01:24:36.648 --> 01:24:38.300
Thanks, Max.

2256
01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.664
MATT: It looks like there are a few pieces of paper

2257
01:24:41.664 --> 01:24:44.106
that are requesting more hands and volunteers

2258
01:24:44.106 --> 01:24:46.800
for the war effort against the terrible

2259
01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.694
and dangerous Kryn incursion.

2260
01:24:50.694 --> 01:24:53.706
It looks like there are some postings looking for

2261
01:24:53.706 --> 01:24:57.049
mercenary work to help bolster defenses

2262
01:24:57.049 --> 01:25:00.623
against more riled-up

2263
01:25:00.623 --> 01:25:04.465
goblin and ogre attacks in bands

2264
01:25:04.465 --> 01:25:06.149
that seem to be getting more bold

2265
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:08.704
as some of the defenses are being pushed

2266
01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.787
further and further east.

2267
01:25:12.787 --> 01:25:14.742
Other than that, it's a couple of postings

2268
01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:18.219
for just general farm hands and aid in reconstruction,

2269
01:25:18.219 --> 01:25:21.123
looking for anybody who's handy with tools

2270
01:25:21.123 --> 01:25:24.056
for a low weekly pay.

2271
01:25:24.056 --> 01:25:25.878
Nothing else that catches your attention.

2272
01:25:25.878 --> 01:25:26.899
MARISHA: Okay.

2273
01:25:26.899 --> 01:25:30.990
LAURA: Did we already ask if Thadeus' shop

2274
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:33.031
had been completely rebuilt?

2275
01:25:33.031 --> 01:25:35.053
Was this an inn, Thadeus Candleglow?

2276
01:25:35.053 --> 01:25:37.297
MATT: Yeah, the Candleglow is not done yet,

2277
01:25:37.297 --> 01:25:39.032
but it's mostly there, it'll probably be

2278
01:25:39.032 --> 01:25:40.859
another two weeks or so of construction.

2279
01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:42.665
LAURA: Okay. Is he around?

2280
01:25:42.665 --> 01:25:44.360
MATT: You can talk to him if you like.

2281
01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.854
LAURA: Yeah, let me go find Thaddeus.

2282
01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:47.451
MATT: Okay.

2283
01:25:48.326 --> 01:25:51.201
Thadeus in Alfield, going through my notes.

2284
01:25:53.338 --> 01:25:55.419
Hopping around location to location.

2285
01:25:55.419 --> 01:25:56.982
All righty.

2286
01:25:56.982 --> 01:25:58.615
All right, so yeah, you find Thadeus.

2287
01:25:58.615 --> 01:26:00.403
SAM: We get a great sense of Matt's accents tonight.

2288
01:26:00.403 --> 01:26:01.236
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2289
01:26:02.759 --> 01:26:04.957
MATT: "Oh, hi there.

2290
01:26:04.957 --> 01:26:06.939
"I remember you. You were one of the folks

2291
01:26:06.939 --> 01:26:10.125
"that came in and helped out with everything

2292
01:26:10.125 --> 01:26:11.511
"that went on down here."

2293
01:26:11.511 --> 01:26:12.495
LAURA: Yeah.

2294
01:26:12.495 --> 01:26:13.853
MATT: "It's good to see you again.

2295
01:26:13.853 --> 01:26:15.338
"We're not quite up and running, unfortunately.

2296
01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:17.740
"We're not seeing folk in yet, but give us

2297
01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.172
"a little bit of time and--"
LAURA: It's very close.

2298
01:26:19.172 --> 01:26:21.041
MATT: "--we'll be good to go. We're getting there."

2299
01:26:21.041 --> 01:26:24.177
LAURA: I'm going to take 10 gold and give it to him.

2300
01:26:24.177 --> 01:26:25.424
MATT: "What, why--?"

2301
01:26:25.424 --> 01:26:29.340
LAURA: The Traveler has been looking out for you, you know.

2302
01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.173
MATT: "Who?"

2303
01:26:30.173 --> 01:26:31.469
LAURA: The Traveler.

2304
01:26:31.469 --> 01:26:34.062
I told you about him before.

2305
01:26:34.062 --> 01:26:35.289
MATT: "Right."

2306
01:26:35.289 --> 01:26:36.497
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2307
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.209
MATT: "Well, you tell this Traveler that his--"

2308
01:26:40.209 --> 01:26:42.780
LAURA: I'm going to paint a figure of the Traveler

2309
01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.134
with my special paint, and I'm going to give him

2310
01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.317
a little statue of the Traveler.

2311
01:26:48.317 --> 01:26:49.887
MATT: "Okay, okay."

2312
01:26:49.887 --> 01:26:51.170
(laughs)

2313
01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:54.227
LAURA: I would just suggest keeping this on your mantle,

2314
01:26:54.227 --> 01:26:55.405
you know?

2315
01:26:55.405 --> 01:26:59.402
As a thank you, since he blessed you so much.

2316
01:26:59.402 --> 01:27:00.811
MATT: "Of course, of course, no.

2317
01:27:00.811 --> 01:27:04.561
"I'll take any sort of guidance that any...

2318
01:27:05.489 --> 01:27:07.745
"being might bring to us to have better luck

2319
01:27:07.745 --> 01:27:09.055
"than we've had in the past."

2320
01:27:09.055 --> 01:27:10.089
LAURA: That's right.

2321
01:27:10.089 --> 01:27:11.988
He blesses you daily.

2322
01:27:11.988 --> 01:27:13.495
MATT: "Thank you so much."

2323
01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:15.450
(laughter)

2324
01:27:15.450 --> 01:27:18.092
TRAVIS: Jester's getting creepy with that shit.

2325
01:27:18.092 --> 01:27:21.254
MATT: You watch him go over and pocket the gold,

2326
01:27:21.254 --> 01:27:24.328
set it up on the hearth above the fireplace

2327
01:27:24.328 --> 01:27:26.712
amongst a couple of pieces

2328
01:27:26.712 --> 01:27:30.864
of probably wax fruit, and a bone of some kind.

2329
01:27:30.864 --> 01:27:32.224
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2330
01:27:32.224 --> 01:27:33.719
Bag of nails.

2331
01:27:33.719 --> 01:27:34.820
LAURA: Awesome.

2332
01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.704
LIAM: (like Jester) They all float down here, you know?

2333
01:27:36.704 --> 01:27:39.680
(laughter)

2334
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.436
MATT: "Well, it's good to see you, appreciate it."

2335
01:27:41.436 --> 01:27:42.309
LAURA: Yes, of course.

2336
01:27:42.309 --> 01:27:46.999
Blessings upon you, and remember always also

2337
01:27:46.999 --> 01:27:50.313
be looking out for Traveler Con and stuff.

2338
01:27:50.313 --> 01:27:51.188
MATT: "What?"

2339
01:27:51.188 --> 01:27:52.355
TALIESIN: "Always also be looking out

2340
01:27:52.355 --> 01:27:54.555
"for Traveler Con and stuff."

2341
01:27:54.555 --> 01:27:56.647
It's catchy, it's catchy.

2342
01:27:56.647 --> 01:27:59.064
(laughs)

2343
01:27:59.064 --> 01:28:00.087
MATT: All right.

2344
01:28:00.087 --> 01:28:01.010
LAURA: To Zadash!

2345
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:02.829
SAM: To Zadash!
MARISHA: To Zadash!

2346
01:28:02.829 --> 01:28:03.662
TRAVIS: Maybe.

2347
01:28:03.662 --> 01:28:04.745
TALIESIN: Three Zadash.

2348
01:28:04.745 --> 01:28:06.203
LAURA: Three Zadash!

2349
01:28:06.203 --> 01:28:07.587
(laughs like the Count from Sesame Street)

2350
01:28:07.587 --> 01:28:09.631
MATT: All right, continuing on.

2351
01:28:09.631 --> 01:28:11.478
Roughly three, three and a half more days

2352
01:28:11.478 --> 01:28:14.034
until you get to Zadash, traveling northward.

2353
01:28:14.034 --> 01:28:18.061
The weather itself is still cool, but it looks like

2354
01:28:18.061 --> 01:28:21.078
you're moving away from the snowier winters

2355
01:28:21.078 --> 01:28:22.898
that seem to have been taking the northern part

2356
01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:24.585
of the continent.

2357
01:28:24.585 --> 01:28:27.210
You can still see some slush and some dirty ice

2358
01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:30.519
and snow that's in the process of melting away.

2359
01:28:30.519 --> 01:28:31.713
Is there anything you wish to do

2360
01:28:31.713 --> 01:28:34.183
during the multi-day journey to Zadash?

2361
01:28:34.183 --> 01:28:35.665
LAURA: Should I see if--
SAM: No!

2362
01:28:35.665 --> 01:28:37.174
LAURA: --they're still there?
SAM: Oh, you mean scrying?

2363
01:28:37.174 --> 01:28:38.222
Sure, sure. Go for it.

2364
01:28:38.222 --> 01:28:40.490
(laughter)

2365
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:42.672
LAURA: I'm just going to scry on Yasha one more time

2366
01:28:42.672 --> 01:28:44.499
to see if they're still there and maybe--

2367
01:28:44.499 --> 01:28:45.599
MATT: Okay.

2368
01:28:47.039 --> 01:28:50.539
That's a natural one on that saving throw.

2369
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:54.556
SAM: (whispering) Guide yourself.

2370
01:28:54.556 --> 01:28:56.614
LAURA: I can't in those situations

2371
01:28:56.614 --> 01:28:57.996
'cause I don't know it's coming.

2372
01:28:57.996 --> 01:28:59.419
I already asked if I could.

2373
01:29:02.378 --> 01:29:05.110
MATT: The Traveler's presence warms

2374
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:06.368
the space around you

2375
01:29:06.368 --> 01:29:08.071
and as you hold your hands in front,

2376
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:10.738
you feel his hands clasps yours.

2377
01:29:12.708 --> 01:29:17.708
The voice goes, "Hmm, let's see what

2378
01:29:17.868 --> 01:29:20.729
"your friend's doing. This way,"

2379
01:29:20.729 --> 01:29:22.587
and his head turns this direction,

2380
01:29:22.587 --> 01:29:24.133
and your vision suddenly (whooshes),

2381
01:29:24.133 --> 01:29:27.134
shifts in this rapid pace, zig-zagging through

2382
01:29:27.134 --> 01:29:31.762
blurring topography, mountains, hills come dodging through.

2383
01:29:31.762 --> 01:29:34.267
Suddenly, you wince for a second.

2384
01:29:34.267 --> 01:29:39.225
Your eyes seeing a bright sun, reddish-orange in the sky,

2385
01:29:42.095 --> 01:29:44.203
partially broken clouds above.

2386
01:29:45.183 --> 01:29:47.383
You see Yasha,

2387
01:29:48.274 --> 01:29:51.881
walking through a rough-looking

2388
01:29:51.881 --> 01:29:54.372
swampy waste in an open plain.

2389
01:29:57.205 --> 01:29:59.759
This is a Xhorhasian sky.

2390
01:29:59.759 --> 01:30:01.300
LAURA: Oh.

2391
01:30:04.537 --> 01:30:08.220
MATT: You see her walking alongside

2392
01:30:09.623 --> 01:30:12.764
a similar cloaked and hooded figure.

2393
01:30:12.764 --> 01:30:15.468
Her cloak she had previously is just off the shoulder,

2394
01:30:15.468 --> 01:30:18.899
hood down, and the hulking shape of the Laughing Hand

2395
01:30:18.899 --> 01:30:23.873
also mostly wrapped and obscured by a much heavier cloak

2396
01:30:23.873 --> 01:30:26.566
than the one that you had first encountered him with,

2397
01:30:26.566 --> 01:30:28.524
looming across the field.

2398
01:30:28.524 --> 01:30:30.241
Make a perception check for me.

2399
01:30:30.241 --> 01:30:31.074
TRAVIS: Come on.

2400
01:30:31.074 --> 01:30:32.187
Come on, Guidance and shit!

2401
01:30:32.187 --> 01:30:34.558
LAURA: I can't Guidance myself on this stuff!

2402
01:30:34.558 --> 01:30:35.891
I already asked.

2403
01:30:36.916 --> 01:30:38.486
God dammit!

2404
01:30:38.486 --> 01:30:39.486
SAM: Holy shit.

2405
01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:42.289
LAURA: (screaming)

2406
01:30:42.289 --> 01:30:43.597
SAM: Threes and twos tonight.

2407
01:30:43.597 --> 01:30:44.911
LAURA: Eight!

2408
01:30:44.911 --> 01:30:45.994
MATT: Okay.

2409
01:30:45.994 --> 01:30:48.108
You follow them along.

2410
01:30:48.108 --> 01:30:49.283
LAURA: That's what I was talking about,

2411
01:30:49.283 --> 01:30:53.246
my pre-rolls were all twos and threes!

2412
01:30:53.246 --> 01:30:56.986
MATT: You follow them along. They're just walking.

2413
01:30:56.986 --> 01:31:01.535
You hear, just outside of the periphery, Obann,

2414
01:31:01.535 --> 01:31:04.675
the voice familiar to you, speaking,

2415
01:31:04.675 --> 01:31:07.574
seems to be ranting a bit under his breath

2416
01:31:07.574 --> 01:31:10.429
in the direction of Yasha, but you can't quite make out

2417
01:31:10.429 --> 01:31:12.516
the details of what he's saying.

2418
01:31:12.516 --> 01:31:14.458
Can't quite make out the locations of where they're at.

2419
01:31:14.458 --> 01:31:16.340
You can see there's like some shapes,

2420
01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:19.716
but the sensor of your scry stays focused around Yasha,

2421
01:31:19.716 --> 01:31:22.686
most blurs beyond that immediate radius.

2422
01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.150
At least you can make out topography.

2423
01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:27.948
It does appear to be Xhorhasian

2424
01:31:27.948 --> 01:31:30.798
in the familiar lighting of the sun

2425
01:31:30.798 --> 01:31:33.454
and the broken landscape, though you're not certain

2426
01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:36.208
of the actual location there.

2427
01:31:36.208 --> 01:31:37.041
LAURA: Okay.

2428
01:31:38.755 --> 01:31:42.385
MATT: After about 10 minutes or so of focusing,

2429
01:31:42.385 --> 01:31:43.726
you lose your tether.

2430
01:31:43.726 --> 01:31:46.919
LAURA: They were in like a swamp in Xhorhas.

2431
01:31:46.919 --> 01:31:49.425
SAM: They're all over the place.

2432
01:31:49.425 --> 01:31:52.857
LAURA: I'm going to send a message without telling Beau.

2433
01:31:52.857 --> 01:31:53.690
MATT: Okay.

2434
01:31:53.690 --> 01:31:56.718
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Thoreau.

2435
01:31:56.718 --> 01:31:57.551
SAM: Oh.

2436
01:31:58.503 --> 01:31:59.661
MARISHA: To my dad?

2437
01:32:01.619 --> 01:32:04.521
LAURA: (Zeenoth imitation) It's me again, just making sure

2438
01:32:04.521 --> 01:32:07.021
everything's still okay there.

2439
01:32:10.434 --> 01:32:13.593
It's Archivist Zeenoth.

2440
01:32:15.374 --> 01:32:16.291
Doing good?

2441
01:32:17.461 --> 01:32:18.956
There at your house?

2442
01:32:18.956 --> 01:32:20.732
Anything strange going on?

2443
01:32:20.732 --> 01:32:22.246
That's what I'm asking about.

2444
01:32:22.246 --> 01:32:24.171
Anything weird.

2445
01:32:25.281 --> 01:32:27.614
(chuckling)

2446
01:32:29.892 --> 01:32:32.225
MATT: "No, everything's fine.

2447
01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.262
"Have we met?"

2448
01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.073
(laughter)

2449
01:32:39.073 --> 01:32:41.240
"I don't know if we've met.

2450
01:32:42.502 --> 01:32:44.702
"You're starting to worry me a little.

2451
01:32:44.702 --> 01:32:46.035
"Everything okay?

2452
01:32:47.730 --> 01:32:48.598
"Who is this?"

2453
01:32:48.598 --> 01:32:50.848
(laughter)

2454
01:32:52.791 --> 01:32:54.832
LAURA: I'll send a message back.

2455
01:32:54.832 --> 01:32:56.330
I can see you right now.

2456
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:57.464
SAM: Oh Jesus.

2457
01:32:58.682 --> 01:33:02.314
LAURA: I'm watching everything you're doing.

2458
01:33:02.314 --> 01:33:03.147
That's all.

2459
01:33:03.147 --> 01:33:06.011
MATT: Make a deception check.

2460
01:33:06.011 --> 01:33:07.713
SAM: Of course, of course.

2461
01:33:07.713 --> 01:33:09.400
(laughter)

2462
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.358
LAURA: 24.

2463
01:33:10.358 --> 01:33:12.176
(laughter)

2464
01:33:12.176 --> 01:33:14.965
LIAM: If it's fuckery, it comes through.

2465
01:33:14.965 --> 01:33:16.767
TALIESIN: Is this real genius, okay.

2466
01:33:16.767 --> 01:33:18.970
MATT: The only thing you hear in response is, "Oh no."

2467
01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:20.044
(laughter)

2468
01:33:20.044 --> 01:33:21.077
And silence.

2469
01:33:21.077 --> 01:33:22.585

2470
01:33:22.585 --> 01:33:24.233
LIAM: Thoreau-regard, this is Jesus.

(laughter)

2472
01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:27.298
TALIESIN: I want you to stop touching yourself.

2473
01:33:27.298 --> 01:33:30.438
TRAVIS: The Lionguards sold their winery and moved down--

2474
01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.306
MARISHA: Yeah, just overnight.

2475
01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:35.320
TRAVIS: To the Menagerie Coast, an unprompted move.

2476
01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.091
(laughter)

2477
01:33:37.091 --> 01:33:42.091
Thoreau Lionguard said he heard voices while he was pooping.

2478
01:33:42.197 --> 01:33:43.396
(laughter)

2479
01:33:43.396 --> 01:33:45.492
MARISHA: He later murdered his wife.

2480
01:33:45.492 --> 01:33:46.867
MATT: Oh my god.

2481
01:33:46.867 --> 01:33:47.775
TALIESIN: Religious movement.

2482
01:33:47.775 --> 01:33:49.977
LAURA: Everything's okay at your house, though.

2483
01:33:49.977 --> 01:33:51.872
MARISHA: Huh?

2484
01:33:51.872 --> 01:33:55.928
LAURA: They didn't do anything at your house.

2485
01:33:55.928 --> 01:33:58.144
MARISHA: Yeah, I know, you told me that yesterday.

2486
01:33:58.144 --> 01:33:59.722
LAURA: Yeah, but then they left, and I just wanted

2487
01:33:59.722 --> 01:34:01.252
to make sure they didn't do anything after.

2488
01:34:01.252 --> 01:34:02.911
MARISHA: You checked in with my dad again?

2489
01:34:02.911 --> 01:34:05.007
LAURA: Well, I just checked to make sure

2490
01:34:05.007 --> 01:34:06.421
that nothing weird happened.

2491
01:34:06.421 --> 01:34:09.006
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

2492
01:34:09.006 --> 01:34:10.928
What'd he say?

2493
01:34:10.928 --> 01:34:13.963
LAURA: He said that nothing weird has happened,

2494
01:34:13.963 --> 01:34:17.854
and then he kind of

2495
01:34:17.854 --> 01:34:20.470
sounded creeped out by me a little bit.

2496
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:23.011
(laughter)

2497
01:34:23.011 --> 01:34:23.844
MARISHA: Okay.

2498
01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:29.704
Knowing my dad, he's a little superstitious.

2499
01:34:29.704 --> 01:34:31.942
He gets a little spooked when it comes to

2500
01:34:31.942 --> 01:34:32.775
that type of stuff.

2501
01:34:32.775 --> 01:34:34.540
LAURA: Then he's going to be nice and spooked.

2502
01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:37.458
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

2503
01:34:37.458 --> 01:34:40.421
He used to ramble all the time that he thought

2504
01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:42.984
some witch or woman was going to come back

2505
01:34:42.984 --> 01:34:47.313
and like collect a piece of his fortune or some shit.

2506
01:34:47.313 --> 01:34:50.188
I don't know.
TRAVIS: Oh no.

2507
01:34:50.188 --> 01:34:51.558
MARISHA: So yeah.

2508
01:34:51.558 --> 01:34:52.985
(laughter)

2509
01:34:52.985 --> 01:34:56.269
TRAVIS: What have you done?

2510
01:34:56.269 --> 01:34:57.905
SAM: That's useful information.

2511
01:34:57.905 --> 01:34:58.890
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

2512
01:34:58.890 --> 01:35:01.390
SAM: For future communication.

2513
01:35:02.397 --> 01:35:04.454

LAURA: That's great.

2516
01:35:06.817 --> 01:35:08.793
MARISHA: Yeah, I figured he was just crazy,

2517
01:35:08.793 --> 01:35:12.214
so I hope he's squirming a little bit. (laughs)

2518
01:35:12.214 --> 01:35:13.743
LAURA: I think he will be.

2519
01:35:13.743 --> 01:35:16.438

as you're traveling along there,

2526
01:35:25.444 --> 01:35:29.490
I'll have one more person keep the perception check--

LAURA: I will, oh, just one, can I help?

2528
01:35:31.211 --> 01:35:33.036
MATT: If you want to help, you can take advantage on that.

2529
01:35:33.036 --> 01:35:34.070
LAURA: Advantage.
TALIESIN: I'll take advantage.

2530
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:35.556
LAURA: Guidance.

2531
01:35:35.556 --> 01:35:36.821
TALIESIN: Can I do Guidance on this?

2532
01:35:36.821 --> 01:35:40.657
LAURA: Yeah, it's a night watch.
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.

MATT: 21, okay.

2537
01:35:55.368 --> 01:35:59.051
You do notice in the far distance,

2538
01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:03.162
to the right-hand side about two days into

2539
01:36:03.162 --> 01:36:05.729
the three and a half day journey,

2540
01:36:05.729 --> 01:36:09.837
a very faint bit of

2541
01:36:09.837 --> 01:36:11.720
long, burned out smoke,

2542
01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.211
like just a faint trail, like a campfire or something.

2543
01:36:15.211 --> 01:36:16.490
TALIESIN: How far away?

2544
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:18.906
MATT: I'd say it's about

2545
01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.215
a third of a mile from where you are

2546
01:36:21.215 --> 01:36:22.632
on the main road.

(mumbling)

2551
01:36:32.298 --> 01:36:37.176
TALIESIN: I'm going to wake Fjord up when I see this.

2552
01:36:37.176 --> 01:36:38.009
TRAVIS: Wait.

2553
01:36:40.031 --> 01:36:44.348
TALIESIN: Fjord, would you take a look, do you see that?

2554
01:36:45.608 --> 01:36:46.453
TRAVIS: Do I see it?

2555
01:36:46.453 --> 01:36:50.120
MATT: You see there's some patches of trees, and

2556
01:36:51.364 --> 01:36:54.312
you do see the very faint trail of smoke, yeah.

2557
01:36:54.312 --> 01:36:55.769
TALIESIN: That feels suspicious to me.

2558
01:36:55.769 --> 01:36:57.060
TRAVIS: It does.

2559
01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.772
It's close enough to be worrisome.

2560
01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:00.980
TALIESIN: Should we, I don't know,

2561
01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:03.516
send Nott to take a look maybe? Wake her up?

2562
01:37:03.516 --> 01:37:06.437
TRAVIS: She is so grumpy when you wake her, though.

2563
01:37:06.437 --> 01:37:08.203
TALIESIN: Well, that's why I woke you up first.

2564
01:37:08.203 --> 01:37:09.642
TRAVIS: Right, right.

2565
01:37:09.642 --> 01:37:12.003
I am her favorite, after all.

2566
01:37:12.003 --> 01:37:13.215
TALIESIN: Are you?

2567
01:37:13.215 --> 01:37:14.286
TRAVIS: No.
TALIESIN: Oh.

2568
01:37:14.286 --> 01:37:17.106
Maybe I should've woken Caleb up.

2569
01:37:17.106 --> 01:37:21.635
TRAVIS: No, I think he's even grumpier in the morning.

2570
01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:24.294
We could just, you know, check it out.

2571
01:37:24.294 --> 01:37:27.696
TALIESIN: That's what I was thinking, that maybe quietly,

2572
01:37:27.696 --> 01:37:30.430
I'm not that quiet, obviously, but we could quietly

2573
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:33.388
just take a look, see what's over there,

2574
01:37:33.388 --> 01:37:36.295
who that is, if we've got a problem.

2575
01:37:36.295 --> 01:37:38.034
TRAVIS: Yes, why not? Let's go.

2576
01:37:38.034 --> 01:37:38.867
TALIESIN: All right.

2577
01:37:38.867 --> 01:37:43.645

SAM: (pigeon cooing)

2579
01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:49.104
TALIESIN: I was going to wake Nott up, just to have a--

2580
01:37:49.104 --> 01:37:50.497
TRAVIS: All right.

2581
01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:52.328
TALIESIN: Yeah, we should probably let everybody--

2582
01:37:52.328 --> 01:37:55.911
TRAVIS: Hold on, let me wake Nott, just so it's gentle,

2583
01:37:55.911 --> 01:37:58.876
don't want to disturb her too much.

2584
01:37:58.876 --> 01:38:01.209
I'll come over and I'll very softly

2585
01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:04.381
put my hand under the back of Nott's head,

2586
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:07.671
gently lift it up, and then just drop her.

2587
01:38:07.671 --> 01:38:09.733
(laughter)

2588
01:38:09.733 --> 01:38:10.566
MATT: Bop!

2589
01:38:10.566 --> 01:38:12.311
SAM: (startled noise) I'll disembowel you, where are you!

2590
01:38:12.311 --> 01:38:13.553
I'm going to fuck you up!

2591
01:38:13.553 --> 01:38:14.434
(screaming)

2592
01:38:14.434 --> 01:38:16.451
TRAVIS: No, don't, it's only me!

2593
01:38:16.451 --> 01:38:18.639
We saw smoke, perhaps from a campfire,

2594
01:38:18.639 --> 01:38:20.189
about a third of a mile away.

2595
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:21.275
MATT: The rest of you are awake now.

2596
01:38:21.275 --> 01:38:23.057
(laughter)

2597
01:38:23.057 --> 01:38:25.508
TRAVIS: We wanted to see if maybe you wanted to check it out

2598
01:38:25.508 --> 01:38:27.483
and see if we were being followed.

2599
01:38:27.483 --> 01:38:28.842
SAM: Sure.

2600
01:38:28.842 --> 01:38:30.136
MARISHA: Did you have a nightmare?

2601
01:38:30.136 --> 01:38:31.227
What's happening?
SAM: Yeah.

2602
01:38:31.227 --> 01:38:32.285
MARISHA: Are we killing somebody?

2603
01:38:32.285 --> 01:38:33.567
SAM: I don't know what happened.

2604
01:38:33.567 --> 01:38:34.571
My head hurts.

2605
01:38:34.571 --> 01:38:36.823
TALIESIN: We think we might be being followed.

2606
01:38:36.823 --> 01:38:37.656
MARISHA: What?

2607
01:38:37.656 --> 01:38:39.908
TALIESIN: Well, somebody's got a campfire

2608
01:38:39.908 --> 01:38:41.729
about a third of a mile away, we're just going to

2609
01:38:41.729 --> 01:38:45.430
check it out real quick and make sure it's not a problem.

2610
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:47.258
LAURA and MARISHA: Okay.

2611
01:38:47.258 --> 01:38:49.849
SAM: I'll just go scout ahead and send a message back.

2612
01:38:49.849 --> 01:38:50.682
TRAVIS: Sure.

2613
01:38:50.682 --> 01:38:53.014
SAM: A third of a mile, that's too far.

2614
01:38:53.014 --> 01:38:55.512
MARISHA: It's probably just a campfire. It's fine.

2615
01:38:55.512 --> 01:38:57.378
LIAM: I'll send Frumpkin with you, you talk to him.

2616
01:38:57.378 --> 01:38:58.211
SAM: Great.

2617
01:38:59.329 --> 01:39:01.516
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: I'll go invisible.

2618
01:39:01.516 --> 01:39:02.556
MATT: Okay.

2619
01:39:02.556 --> 01:39:04.388
TRAVIS: You've got a 400.

2620
01:39:04.388 --> 01:39:06.317
LAURA: Have a good time.

2621
01:39:06.317 --> 01:39:08.848
(laughter)

2622
01:39:08.848 --> 01:39:11.717
SAM: I will stealth over to them.

2623
01:39:11.717 --> 01:39:14.461
MATT: With advantage, go ahead and roll a stealth check.

2624
01:39:14.461 --> 01:39:15.878
SAM: Ooh, terrible.

2625
01:39:15.878 --> 01:39:17.191
LAURA: That's, oh.

2626
01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:19.850
(laughter)

2627
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:21.388
SAM: Still 19.

2628
01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:23.081
MATT: Still not bad, all right.

2629
01:39:23.081 --> 01:39:26.310
Making your way across the field, looming over

2630
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:28.509
the slight raised hill that's between you

2631
01:39:28.509 --> 01:39:30.652
and the slight little path of smoke,

2632
01:39:30.652 --> 01:39:32.673
you head over down into this small,

2633
01:39:32.673 --> 01:39:35.600
miniature valley, and as you approach,

2634
01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.996
you can see what was probably a campfire,

2635
01:39:39.996 --> 01:39:42.501
like a ring of stone that smoke is emanating from.

2636
01:39:42.501 --> 01:39:46.354
You see like some scattered bags

2637
01:39:46.354 --> 01:39:49.200
or refuse around the outside of it from a distance.

2638
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.095
LAURA: Scattered bags of poop.

2639
01:39:51.095 --> 01:39:52.952
SAM: Or trash?
TRAVIS: Refuse.

2640
01:39:52.952 --> 01:39:54.921
(laughter)

2641
01:39:54.921 --> 01:39:56.952
SAM: But no one's in the camp.

2642
01:39:56.952 --> 01:39:58.019
MATT: You're still approaching.
SAM: Oh.

2643
01:39:58.019 --> 01:40:00.140
MATT: So you get all the way up to the camp?

2644
01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.054
SAM: Yes, please.

2645
01:40:01.054 --> 01:40:03.299
LIAM: By the way, did send Frumpkin,

2646
01:40:03.299 --> 01:40:06.190
and 20 steps in, Nott disappeared.

2647
01:40:06.190 --> 01:40:07.023
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2648
01:40:07.023 --> 01:40:09.272
LIAM: So Frumpkin is just going, I have no idea

2649
01:40:09.272 --> 01:40:11.489
if with her or not, but is also going.

2650
01:40:11.489 --> 01:40:12.322
MATT: Okay.

2651
01:40:12.322 --> 01:40:14.208
SAM: I'm just assuming Frumpkin's right next to me.

2652
01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:15.865
MATT: Frumpkin is way behind you, because he's

2653
01:40:15.865 --> 01:40:19.286
nowhere near as fast.
SAM: Okay, great.

2654
01:40:19.286 --> 01:40:20.928
MATT: You get closer and begin to see that

2655
01:40:20.928 --> 01:40:24.285
the piles of refuse are not piles of refuse.

2656
01:40:24.285 --> 01:40:28.846
Some of them look to be scattered bed rolls.

2657
01:40:28.846 --> 01:40:30.179
Some are bodies.

2658
01:40:31.581 --> 01:40:32.639
SAM: Like dead bodies, or?

2659
01:40:32.639 --> 01:40:35.128
MATT: They're not moving.

2660
01:40:35.128 --> 01:40:37.870
You get closer, and you see

2661
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:41.226
two horses that are on their side, torn open.

2662
01:40:41.226 --> 01:40:42.447
(gasping)

2663
01:40:42.447 --> 01:40:46.511
Getting in closer still, the three bodies that are there

2664
01:40:46.511 --> 01:40:51.502
are also slashed, bitten, torn apart,

2665
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:54.419
robbed of any goods.

2666
01:40:54.419 --> 01:40:56.164
Looking at the horses, they both look like they had

2667
01:40:56.164 --> 01:41:01.164
barding on them, or some sort of means of,

2668
01:41:01.486 --> 01:41:05.188
they were probably attached to a cart or pulling a cart,

2669
01:41:05.188 --> 01:41:07.605
but there is no cart present.

2670
01:41:08.483 --> 01:41:09.650
SAM: Interesting.

2671
01:41:13.221 --> 01:41:17.538
Okay, I'll turn around and look for Frumpkin.

2672
01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:21.419
MATT: Okay, a few moments later you see the cat

2673
01:41:21.419 --> 01:41:23.344
rush up to catch up.

2674
01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:28.207
SAM: Frumpkin, I mean Caleb, if you can see/hear me,

2675
01:41:28.207 --> 01:41:32.987
there are many dead bodies here, come, I need you all.

2676
01:41:32.987 --> 01:41:34.285
LIAM: Did Frumpkin hear?

2677
01:41:34.285 --> 01:41:36.633
I have no idea if he's right there or not.

2678
01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:39.815
MATT: Frumpkin heard.

2679
01:41:39.815 --> 01:41:43.823
TRAVIS: A third of a mile is like 400 yards?

2680
01:41:43.823 --> 01:41:47.555
MATT: Let me see what the distance is on your ability here.

2681
01:41:47.555 --> 01:41:48.555
TRAVIS: How many yards in a mile?

2682
01:41:48.555 --> 01:41:49.388
1500?

2683
01:41:49.388 --> 01:41:51.982
LIAM: We said, we homebrewed this way back

2684
01:41:51.982 --> 01:41:53.175
at the beginning of the campaign,

2685
01:41:53.175 --> 01:41:56.173
it's like once Frumpkin's beyond--

2686
01:41:56.173 --> 01:41:57.307
MATT: Yeah, you cannot communicate.

2687
01:41:57.307 --> 01:41:59.416
LIAM: I can't communicate, but I can see and hear,

2688
01:41:59.416 --> 01:42:01.916
is how we played it.
MATT: Correct.

2689
01:42:03.998 --> 01:42:06.956
Yes, that's what we did with that, yeah.

2690
01:42:06.956 --> 01:42:09.113
LIAM: So I can't tell Frumpkin to do anything at this point,

2691
01:42:09.113 --> 01:42:10.986
but I'm receiving.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2692
01:42:10.986 --> 01:42:14.645
LIAM: So I'll start muttering this to Beauregard.

2693
01:42:14.645 --> 01:42:18.273
MARISHA: Oh, but it's warm inside the dome.

2694
01:42:18.273 --> 01:42:21.339
LAURA: It's not cold out there either.

2695
01:42:21.339 --> 01:42:23.146
SAM: While I wait for them I'm going to walk around

2696
01:42:23.146 --> 01:42:25.196
and look for tracks or markings.

2697
01:42:25.196 --> 01:42:27.410
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2698
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:29.510
SAM: Oh, fuck you.
TRAVIS: What is going on?

2699
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:30.708
LAURA: Oh no, did I pass it?

2700
01:42:30.708 --> 01:42:31.649
SAM: 15, 15.

2701
01:42:31.649 --> 01:42:32.599
MATT: 15.

2702
01:42:32.599 --> 01:42:33.865
SAM: No, I'm sorry, 13.

2703
01:42:33.865 --> 01:42:37.115
LAURA: Am I letting out bad roll fumes?

2704
01:42:38.555 --> 01:42:39.397
MATT: Okay.

2705
01:42:39.397 --> 01:42:41.752
Looking around here, you do see tracks.

2706
01:42:41.752 --> 01:42:45.170
One, you can see dragged wheels,

2707
01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:47.512
grooves in the ground, that whatever cart was here

2708
01:42:47.512 --> 01:42:48.947
was then removed from these dead horses

2709
01:42:48.947 --> 01:42:52.939
and then taken in a southeastern direction.

2710
01:42:52.939 --> 01:42:53.947
SAM: Okay.

2711
01:42:53.947 --> 01:42:56.117
I'll follow along a little bit.

2712
01:42:56.117 --> 01:42:58.205
MATT: Also, looking around at the bodies,

2713
01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:02.162
some of it is bludgeon damage, like crushed face.

2714
01:43:02.162 --> 01:43:06.889
Some appears to be small slashes and gash marks.

2715
01:43:06.889 --> 01:43:08.692
You recognize in particular, just because

2716
01:43:08.692 --> 01:43:11.296
of your previous experience, some of these

2717
01:43:11.296 --> 01:43:14.429
are very akin to or similar to the wounds

2718
01:43:14.429 --> 01:43:16.526
left by goblin attacks.

2719
01:43:16.526 --> 01:43:17.593
SAM: (gasps)

2720
01:43:17.593 --> 01:43:20.510
MATT: Goblin weaponry.

2721
01:43:21.473 --> 01:43:22.939
SAM: Oh shit.

2722
01:43:24.239 --> 01:43:25.272
Oh shit.

2723
01:43:26.495 --> 01:43:27.494
MARISHA: Let's go.

2724
01:43:27.494 --> 01:43:28.978
I'll grab my coat.

2725
01:43:30.076 --> 01:43:31.933
SAM: I'll wait for my friends to arrive.

2726
01:43:31.933 --> 01:43:32.766
MATT: Okay.

2727
01:43:34.145 --> 01:43:35.202
LAURA: (panting)

2728
01:43:35.202 --> 01:43:37.236
MATT: They all eventually trudge up, and you can see

2729
01:43:37.236 --> 01:43:39.802
not Nott, but you see the

2730
01:43:39.802 --> 01:43:42.760
array of deceased before you

2731
01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.932
and the massacre scene left behind.

2732
01:43:44.932 --> 01:43:46.432
TRAVIS: Can anyone tell how long

2733
01:43:46.432 --> 01:43:48.348
they've been here like this?

2734
01:43:48.348 --> 01:43:49.475
LIAM: Let's check the bodies.

2735
01:43:49.475 --> 01:43:50.858
LAURA: We can do a medicine check?

2736
01:43:50.858 --> 01:43:52.330
MATT: Mm-hmm, medicine.
SAM: Or you could raise the dead.

2737
01:43:52.330 --> 01:43:54.699
LAURA: Guidance. Guide me, too.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2738
01:43:54.699 --> 01:43:56.034
LAURA: Guide me.

2739
01:43:56.034 --> 01:43:56.867
Thank you.

2740
01:43:58.340 --> 01:43:59.620
Damn it!
SAM: Jesus.

2741
01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:00.504
LAURA: Shut up.

2742
01:44:00.504 --> 01:44:01.882
TALIESIN: I'll do a medicine check.

2743
01:44:01.882 --> 01:44:04.307
Oh, with Guidance, thank you.

2744
01:44:04.307 --> 01:44:05.812
LAURA: But I have good medicine.

2745
01:44:05.812 --> 01:44:08.315
Well, it's still only 16 for me.
TALIESIN: 16.

2746
01:44:08.315 --> 01:44:10.494
MATT: Fair enough.

2747
01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:13.744
The bodies have probably been dead for,

2748
01:44:15.403 --> 01:44:18.986
I'd say about six hours, seven hours or so.

2749
01:44:20.415 --> 01:44:22.924
TALIESIN: Does one have a face?

2750
01:44:23.947 --> 01:44:26.076
MATT: Two of them have faces that are functional.

2751
01:44:26.076 --> 01:44:28.498
TRAVIS: (laughs) A working face.

2752
01:44:28.498 --> 01:44:32.450
MATT: Like, you know, lax and cut, bloodied as shit,

2753
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:35.276
the third one is just a mashed mess.

2754
01:44:35.276 --> 01:44:36.717
TRAVIS: Can't you go for that one so it just goes like,

2755
01:44:36.717 --> 01:44:38.059
(incoherent gurgling).

2756
01:44:38.059 --> 01:44:39.140
(laughter)

2757
01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:43.312
ALL: (garbled gurgling)

2758
01:44:43.312 --> 01:44:45.624
MARISHA: The one that's a mashed mess, though,

2759
01:44:45.624 --> 01:44:49.702
does that look like it was goblins rolling

2760
01:44:49.702 --> 01:44:51.335
with something else bigger?

2761
01:44:51.335 --> 01:44:53.086
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2762
01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:54.852
LAURA: What were the creatures that got attacked?

2763
01:44:54.852 --> 01:44:56.806
Are they humans, are they--?

2764
01:44:56.806 --> 01:45:00.170
MATT: From what you can tell, the ones that you're still

2765
01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:02.553
able to make out their features, they appear to be human.

2766
01:45:02.553 --> 01:45:03.939
LAURA: Okay.

2767
01:45:03.939 --> 01:45:05.098
MARISHA: 11.

2768
01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:06.556
LIAM: 22.

2769
01:45:06.556 --> 01:45:08.713
MATT: There's a heavy impact into the face that crushed it.

2770
01:45:08.713 --> 01:45:09.979
LIAM: A stone?

2771
01:45:09.979 --> 01:45:12.041
MATT: Appeared to be something hard.

2772
01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:17.041
A large bludgeon, a heavy hammer, something to that degree.

2773
01:45:17.122 --> 01:45:22.076
You don't see a boulder nearby that is messy or bloody,

2774
01:45:22.076 --> 01:45:25.179
but it definitely has that sort of impact feel to it.

2775
01:45:25.179 --> 01:45:28.946
TRAVIS: Any sort of identifying armor or clothing?

2776
01:45:28.946 --> 01:45:30.421
MATT: No armor.

2777
01:45:30.421 --> 01:45:33.159
Look to be travelers.

2778
01:45:33.159 --> 01:45:37.211
All their decent goods or identifying characteristics

2779
01:45:37.211 --> 01:45:38.299
that would give you those clues

2780
01:45:38.299 --> 01:45:41.799
appear to have been stripped from them.

2781
01:45:41.799 --> 01:45:46.624
TALIESIN: Sitting up the cadaver of my choice, and I'm--

2782
01:45:46.624 --> 01:45:47.959
TRAVIS: I'll help. I'll put my knee behind it.

2783
01:45:47.959 --> 01:45:49.753
TALIESIN: Casting Speak With Dead.

2784
01:45:49.753 --> 01:45:50.586
MATT: All righty.

2785
01:45:50.586 --> 01:45:52.685
LAURA: Woo!
LIAM: Spoopy!

2786
01:45:52.685 --> 01:45:56.025
MATT: You get the younger of the two, looks to be a man

2787
01:45:56.025 --> 01:45:59.904
probably in his early 20s or so, a bit unshaved,

2788
01:45:59.904 --> 01:46:01.933
a chin beard starting to come through

2789
01:46:01.933 --> 01:46:03.484
that's a little scraggly.

2790
01:46:03.484 --> 01:46:06.110
His eyes are a little dull, ashamed

2791
01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:09.079
that he went so violently at this age.

2792
01:46:09.079 --> 01:46:11.093
As you complete the spell and focus on,

2793
01:46:11.093 --> 01:46:15.044
you see the lungs fill in, and there's a slight

2794
01:46:15.044 --> 01:46:17.460
horrible groaning moan as it exhales the first time.

2795
01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:19.685
LAURA: (sneezes)
MATT: (crackly exhalation)

2796
01:46:19.685 --> 01:46:20.881
LAURA: Bless me.

2797
01:46:22.708 --> 01:46:23.958
TALIESIN: Hello, friend.

2798
01:46:25.977 --> 01:46:27.411
What happened to you?

2799
01:46:27.411 --> 01:46:30.811
What happened to your group here?

2800
01:46:30.811 --> 01:46:35.227
MATT: "We were sleeping, and

2801
01:46:35.227 --> 01:46:38.218
"something came upon us,

2802
01:46:38.218 --> 01:46:40.049
"fast and many.

2803
01:46:41.613 --> 01:46:44.104
"Some bigger.

2804
01:46:46.306 --> 01:46:47.848
"Many smaller.

2805
01:46:48.958 --> 01:46:51.092
"I couldn't see much."

2806
01:46:55.740 --> 01:47:00.087
TALIESIN: Where were you headed, you and your friends?

2807
01:47:00.087 --> 01:47:03.844
MATT: "We were on our way to Zadash from Alfield."

2808
01:47:03.844 --> 01:47:05.582
SAM: To Zadash!

2809
01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:08.874
MATT: You hear the hype man from the corner.

2810
01:47:08.874 --> 01:47:10.959
TRAVIS: The other dead body's like, "Woo!"

2811
01:47:10.959 --> 01:47:11.792
TALIESIN: "To Zadash!"

2812
01:47:12.676 --> 01:47:14.215
TRAVIS: Sorry, he's like, (burbling).

2813
01:47:14.215 --> 01:47:16.894
(laughter)

2814
01:47:16.894 --> 01:47:19.549
SAM: No one's making it to Zadash in this episode.

2815
01:47:19.549 --> 01:47:21.918
(laughter)

2816
01:47:21.918 --> 01:47:23.638
MARISHA: Zadash or bust.

2817
01:47:23.638 --> 01:47:27.292
MATT: "Bringing produce to trade.

2818
01:47:27.292 --> 01:47:32.042
"Thought we'd stay off the path for safety."

2819
01:47:33.901 --> 01:47:36.317
That's the only response you get beyond that.

2820
01:47:36.317 --> 01:47:38.924
SAM: Do we want to know more about the big ones?

2821
01:47:38.924 --> 01:47:40.211
Or--

2822
01:47:40.211 --> 01:47:43.296
TALIESIN: The things that attacked you,

2823
01:47:43.296 --> 01:47:47.719
was it just crushing blows?

2824
01:47:47.719 --> 01:47:50.949
There was no fire, there was no magic?

2825
01:47:50.949 --> 01:47:53.518
MATT: "I saw nothing flashy.

2826
01:47:53.518 --> 01:47:58.476
"Just screams and terrifying

2827
01:47:59.663 --> 01:48:04.638
"chuckles, and the breaking of horses and men."

2828
01:48:06.581 --> 01:48:08.858
TALIESIN: How many were in your party?

2829
01:48:08.858 --> 01:48:10.026
MATT: Those were your three questions.

2830
01:48:10.026 --> 01:48:11.512
TALIESIN: Oh, I have five.
MATT: Oh, you have five on this, sorry.

2831
01:48:11.512 --> 01:48:12.398
Three is the Commune.

2832
01:48:12.398 --> 01:48:14.521
You do have five questions.

2833
01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:17.156
"It was the three of us."

2834
01:48:17.156 --> 01:48:19.889
TALIESIN: Just the three of you.

2835
01:48:19.889 --> 01:48:23.806
Is there anything you would like taken care of?

2836
01:48:25.105 --> 01:48:27.577
Anything unresolved?

2837
01:48:27.577 --> 01:48:28.607
No.

2838
01:48:28.607 --> 01:48:29.449
MATT: "No."

2839
01:48:29.449 --> 01:48:31.903
You do gather, as part of the nature of this spell,

2840
01:48:31.903 --> 01:48:34.219
it's not the personality or the soul speaking through,

2841
01:48:34.219 --> 01:48:35.457
it's the memory of the flesh.

2842
01:48:35.457 --> 01:48:39.060
TALIESIN: I was curious if there was a task at hand that--

2843
01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.488
MATT: Right, right, right.

2844
01:48:41.488 --> 01:48:44.321
TALIESIN: They're gone, to be fair.
MATT: Yeah.

2845
01:48:45.289 --> 01:48:47.191
The body goes limp, and--

2846
01:48:47.191 --> 01:48:49.294
TALIESIN: Farmers, three of them.

2847
01:48:49.294 --> 01:48:52.681
MARISHA: I saw a sign when we were in Alfield, the post,

2848
01:48:52.681 --> 01:48:56.652
that was saying the orcs and trolls and other vermin

2849
01:48:56.652 --> 01:48:58.916
of the hills were picking up again.

2850
01:48:58.916 --> 01:49:01.310
I'm assuming with all of the soldiers being moved to the--

2851
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:03.004
MATT: Goblins specifically.

2852
01:49:03.004 --> 01:49:07.274
MARISHA: Oh no, goblins and no trolls? No?

2853
01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:09.067
MATT: Didn't say trolls, no, just goblins.

2854
01:49:09.067 --> 01:49:10.695
TALIESIN: Goblins and something big.

2855
01:49:10.695 --> 01:49:12.407
MARISHA: Something big.

2856
01:49:12.407 --> 01:49:15.663
LAURA: Did the goblin tribe that you were,

2857
01:49:15.663 --> 01:49:20.663
did they have big things they traveled around with?

2858
01:49:20.877 --> 01:49:24.417
SAM: We usually just had goblins, I mean, you know,

2859
01:49:24.417 --> 01:49:27.081
in our clan, we just had goblins.

2860
01:49:27.081 --> 01:49:32.081
They worked with some non-goblins,

2861
01:49:32.253 --> 01:49:34.611
but they weren't giant creatures.

2862
01:49:34.611 --> 01:49:37.215
There was a human.

2863
01:49:37.215 --> 01:49:38.738
LAURA: What human?

2864
01:49:38.738 --> 01:49:40.006
SAM: A woman.

2865
01:49:40.006 --> 01:49:43.094
The woman who did this to me.

2866
01:49:43.094 --> 01:49:44.052
LAURA: Oh, right.

2867
01:49:44.052 --> 01:49:45.698
SAM: A mage of some sort.

2868
01:49:45.698 --> 01:49:48.790
I don't know her, a hooded woman.

2869
01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:53.681
TALIESIN: I'm going to Decompose.

2870
01:49:53.681 --> 01:49:55.356
Hit everything that's still here

2871
01:49:55.356 --> 01:49:57.074
and just put it in a corner.

2872
01:49:57.074 --> 01:49:58.882
LAURA: (scoffs) Tell me about it.

2873
01:49:59.951 --> 01:50:02.061
LIAM: With all the, I can't remember,

2874
01:50:02.061 --> 01:50:04.259
I don't know if Nott looked or not,

2875
01:50:04.259 --> 01:50:06.866
but with all the wheels and the carnage,

2876
01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:08.785
can we tell where things have been dragged,

2877
01:50:08.785 --> 01:50:09.800
in what direction?

2878
01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:11.017
SAM: Yes.

2879
01:50:11.017 --> 01:50:12.232
MATT: Southeast.

2880
01:50:12.232 --> 01:50:13.228
LIAM: When Nott was here before us?

2881
01:50:13.228 --> 01:50:14.477
Okay.

2882
01:50:14.477 --> 01:50:16.526
LAURA: I mean, do we follow the goblins?

2883
01:50:16.526 --> 01:50:21.526
Or is it like, well, the goblins got some veggies.

2884
01:50:21.905 --> 01:50:24.533
SAM: I mean, I really would love to kill some goblins,

2885
01:50:24.533 --> 01:50:27.234
but I'm not going to hold us up.

2886
01:50:28.442 --> 01:50:32.135
TRAVIS: Finish the rest of the night
and then we head onto Zadash?

2887
01:50:32.135 --> 01:50:34.695
LAURA: To--
SAM: To Zadash?

2888
01:50:34.695 --> 01:50:36.780
LIAM: Is there the remains of a fire here

2889
01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:38.741
that was seen from the distance?

2890
01:50:38.741 --> 01:50:40.640
That's what alerted us that something was out here.

2891
01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.416
MATT: This was found in the morning.

2892
01:50:42.416 --> 01:50:43.723
This is when you guys were

2893
01:50:43.723 --> 01:50:45.381
before consciousness, the sun had just begun to rise,

2894
01:50:45.381 --> 01:50:47.584
and that's when you began to notice the smoke trail.

2895
01:50:47.584 --> 01:50:49.825
So you've had a night's rest, the day's beginning.

2896
01:50:49.825 --> 01:50:52.183
Correct, no fire.

2897
01:50:52.183 --> 01:50:53.716
TALIESIN: Something to take care of, perhaps,

2898
01:50:53.716 --> 01:50:54.927
when we pass through again.

2899
01:50:54.927 --> 01:50:58.166
We are pressed for time right now.

2900
01:51:00.918 --> 01:51:03.572
LAURA: Can I look all over the ground

2901
01:51:03.572 --> 01:51:05.758
just to see and make sure that nothing that was cool

2902
01:51:05.758 --> 01:51:09.302
got left behind. Any sparklies left on the ground?

2903
01:51:09.302 --> 01:51:12.466
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2904
01:51:12.466 --> 01:51:13.858
LAURA: Guide!

2905
01:51:13.858 --> 01:51:15.165
Traveler be with--

2906
01:51:15.165 --> 01:51:16.579
MATT: I'd say because you're not rummaging through things,

2907
01:51:16.579 --> 01:51:18.810
you're looking--
LAURA: I'm looking all over.

2908
01:51:18.810 --> 01:51:22.171
MATT: Investigation or perception, your choice.

2909
01:51:22.171 --> 01:51:24.415
LAURA: (groans)

2910
01:51:24.415 --> 01:51:25.962
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

2911
01:51:25.962 --> 01:51:27.161
SAM: The tide is turning.

2912
01:51:27.161 --> 01:51:29.563
You gave me all your bad luck.

2913
01:51:29.563 --> 01:51:32.067
LIAM: The eagles are coming.

2914
01:51:32.067 --> 01:51:34.746
LAURA: (counting)

2915
01:51:34.746 --> 01:51:36.257
22!

2916
01:51:37.583 --> 01:51:40.724
MATT: You find three copper and a silver piece

2917
01:51:40.724 --> 01:51:43.190
that seem to have not been taken by the attackers

2918
01:51:43.190 --> 01:51:47.088
of this endeavor, but nothing in particular.

2919
01:51:47.088 --> 01:51:49.105
Looks like the farmers unfortunately lost

2920
01:51:49.105 --> 01:51:51.674
their plus three vorpal sword to the goblins.

2921
01:51:51.674 --> 01:51:53.566
LAURA: Hmm, too bad.

2922
01:51:55.677 --> 01:51:56.510
Okay.

2923
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:57.435
MATT: All right.

2924
01:51:57.435 --> 01:52:00.281
You guys continue onward.

2925
01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:02.711
Two more days of travel.

2926
01:52:02.711 --> 01:52:05.069
You head towards the Amber Road northward.

2927
01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:09.575
The familiar space passing by, the offset grave site

2928
01:52:09.575 --> 01:52:10.658
that had once caught your attention

2929
01:52:10.658 --> 01:52:12.512
as you made your way northward.

2930
01:52:12.512 --> 01:52:13.370
LAURA: Oh yeah.

2931
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:14.481
MATT: Until eventually you can see,

2932
01:52:14.481 --> 01:52:17.586
heading down into the valley, the familiar triangular

2933
01:52:17.586 --> 01:52:21.843
outer wall shape at the base of the mountains:

2934
01:52:21.843 --> 01:52:23.426
the city of Zadash.

2935
01:52:24.519 --> 01:52:27.070
Bustling and colorful from this view above,

2936
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:29.322
it's been a while since you've been here.

2937
01:52:29.322 --> 01:52:31.111
ALL: (singing) It's been a while.
TALIESIN: I knew you would.

2938
01:52:31.111 --> 01:52:32.536
MATT: Was waiting for it.

2939
01:52:33.495 --> 01:52:36.074
You make your way down towards the southern gates,

2940
01:52:36.074 --> 01:52:38.023
the entrance to the main city.

2941
01:52:38.023 --> 01:52:43.023
There you can see there is about ten crownsguard,

2942
01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:46.426
buffeted by an additional ten Righteous Brand

2943
01:52:46.426 --> 01:52:48.650
at this entryway.

2944
01:52:48.650 --> 01:52:52.420
As you approach, to a smaller degree, but familiar,

2945
01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.492
a procession of people who are making their way

2946
01:52:54.492 --> 01:52:57.311
into the city after being just looked over.

2947
01:52:57.311 --> 01:52:58.956
It looks to not be quite as extensive

2948
01:52:58.956 --> 01:53:02.731
as the Wuyun Gorge entry way,

2949
01:53:02.731 --> 01:53:05.776
but they are giving glances

2950
01:53:05.776 --> 01:53:09.009
and allowing folks in one after the next.

2951
01:53:09.009 --> 01:53:11.056
Any preparations you wish to make as you approach?

2952
01:53:11.056 --> 01:53:13.931
MARISHA: Cobalt Soul vestiges.

2953
01:53:14.855 --> 01:53:18.247
SAM: Wait, we don't have to be in disguise here, do we?

2954
01:53:18.247 --> 01:53:19.370
Oh, I do, sort of.

2955
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:21.436
LAURA: But I think--

2956
01:53:21.436 --> 01:53:22.525
TALIESIN: They've seen us before.

2957
01:53:22.525 --> 01:53:24.573
MARISHA: They've seen us before,
they should know who we are.

2958
01:53:24.573 --> 01:53:28.227
I just want to look a little bit more official, that's all.

2959
01:53:28.227 --> 01:53:31.314
LAURA: Do our clothes that we're wearing,

2960
01:53:31.314 --> 01:53:34.867
do they look very Xhorhasian, or--?

2961
01:53:34.867 --> 01:53:35.708
MATT: Yeah.

2962
01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:38.500
LAURA: Then yes, I think maybe we
should not be in these clothes.

2963
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:39.369
MARISHA: We should change.

2964
01:53:39.369 --> 01:53:41.761
MATT: Yeah, you've gotten a few looks. (laughs)

2965
01:53:42.736 --> 01:53:45.216
Not like, "Oh my god, they're Xhorhasian!"

2966
01:53:45.216 --> 01:53:49.021
But it's a style that's not very common in the Empire,

2967
01:53:49.021 --> 01:53:51.585
and while you're passing

2968
01:53:51.585 --> 01:53:52.792
through Alfield and Trostenwald.

2969
01:53:52.792 --> 01:53:54.351
LAURA: I'm going to put on my purple dress

2970
01:53:54.351 --> 01:53:57.161
that I took from Nicodranas.

2971
01:53:57.161 --> 01:53:58.290
MATT: Okay.

2972
01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:00.657
TALIESIN: I'll just take my coat off for now,
not doing anything.

2973
01:54:00.657 --> 01:54:04.173
TRAVIS: Back to my original scrubby leathers.

2974
01:54:04.173 --> 01:54:05.399
Mask of Many Faces.

2975
01:54:05.399 --> 01:54:08.663
SAM: I'll myself look like just Veth.

2976
01:54:08.663 --> 01:54:09.496
MATT: Okay.

2977
01:54:12.471 --> 01:54:13.445
MARISHA: Cobalt Soul gear.

2978
01:54:13.445 --> 01:54:14.446
MATT: You got it.

2979
01:54:14.446 --> 01:54:16.038
LAURA: Caleb?

2980
01:54:16.038 --> 01:54:18.622
LIAM: Yeah, I could take care of myself for the day,

2981
01:54:18.622 --> 01:54:21.362
but that takes quite a bit out of me.

2982
01:54:21.362 --> 01:54:22.621
But I will do it.

2983
01:54:22.621 --> 01:54:25.737
LAURA: Or you can just put on your old coat.

2984
01:54:25.737 --> 01:54:26.743
MARISHA: Yeah.

2985
01:54:26.743 --> 01:54:28.743
LIAM: Oh, I got rid of that.

2986
01:54:30.337 --> 01:54:32.405
LAURA: Do you want to put on one of my dresses

2987
01:54:32.405 --> 01:54:34.988
that I brought from Nicodranas?

2988
01:54:35.993 --> 01:54:36.962
(gasps) Oh!

2989
01:54:36.962 --> 01:54:38.086
You know what?

2990
01:54:38.086 --> 01:54:39.227
Wait, hold on, I'm going to look,

2991
01:54:39.227 --> 01:54:41.516
I stole that fancy cloak.
TRAVIS: We're right outside the walls.

2992
01:54:41.516 --> 01:54:46.102
LAURA: Shut up. I stole that fancy cloak from the cabinet.

2993
01:54:46.102 --> 01:54:47.352
Oh, that was...

2994
01:54:48.210 --> 01:54:51.474
SAM: Wasn't it like a kimono sort of?

2995
01:54:51.474 --> 01:54:53.471
LAURA: I don't know, it's probably no better

2996
01:54:53.471 --> 01:54:55.398
than what you're wearing.

2997
01:54:55.398 --> 01:54:57.373
LIAM: I cast Seeming.

2998
01:54:57.373 --> 01:54:58.945
SAM: Oh.

2999
01:54:58.945 --> 01:54:59.872
On all of us?

3000
01:54:59.872 --> 01:55:02.818
LIAM: I could, but everyone seemed to have a plan.

3001
01:55:02.818 --> 01:55:06.131
Does anybody want any changes for the next

3002
01:55:06.131 --> 01:55:07.633
eight hours or so?
TALIESIN: I'm good.

3003
01:55:07.633 --> 01:55:11.583
LAURA: No, my dress is really nice, so, I'm okay in it.

3004
01:55:12.702 --> 01:55:17.230
LIAM: Caleb looks the way he did the first day you met him.

3005
01:55:17.230 --> 01:55:18.063
MATT: All righty.

3006
01:55:18.063 --> 01:55:21.262
SAM: I'll take-- You can make my Veth last eight hours

3007
01:55:21.262 --> 01:55:23.485
instead of one, sure.

3008
01:55:23.485 --> 01:55:24.400
LIAM: Yeah.

3009
01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:25.233
MATT: Okay.

3010
01:55:26.741 --> 01:55:31.172
You all make your way to the gates of Zadash.

3011
01:55:31.172 --> 01:55:34.422
The guards give you glances over.

3012
01:55:35.314 --> 01:55:37.884
MARISHA: Do we recognize any of them?

3013
01:55:37.884 --> 01:55:39.448
MATT: No.
MARISHA: From our time previous?

3014
01:55:39.448 --> 01:55:41.548
MATT: No.
LIAM: The one who kicked my cat?

3015
01:55:42.455 --> 01:55:44.822
MATT: You do not recognize the ones that kicked your cat

3016
01:55:44.822 --> 01:55:46.527
on this side of this city.

3017
01:55:46.527 --> 01:55:48.878
LIAM: I've learned some things
since the last time we were here.

3018
01:55:48.878 --> 01:55:51.211
I've learned a few things.

3019
01:55:54.853 --> 01:55:57.202
MATT: They usher you guys past,

3020
01:55:57.202 --> 01:55:58.962
and you make it through the main gates

3021
01:55:58.962 --> 01:56:01.243
into the familiar city.

3022
01:56:01.243 --> 01:56:04.841
Now arriving on the muddy cobblestone streets of Zadash,

3023
01:56:04.841 --> 01:56:07.133
a familiar sight, though it's been a while

3024
01:56:07.133 --> 01:56:10.929
since you visited, it's weirdly comforting.

3025
01:56:10.929 --> 01:56:13.934
Looking around and seeing the

3026
01:56:13.934 --> 01:56:18.251
standard workers and citizens amongst the peasantry

3027
01:56:18.251 --> 01:56:20.060
and the occasional well-dressed noble

3028
01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:23.235
making their way through. You begin to move

3029
01:56:23.235 --> 01:56:27.602
towards the inner part of the central city of the Empire.

3030
01:56:27.602 --> 01:56:28.819
What would you guys like to do?

3031
01:56:28.819 --> 01:56:31.087
TRAVIS: Fucking Pumat's here.
MARISHA: Pumat's here!

3032
01:56:31.087 --> 01:56:32.993
SAM: We got to go to the Cobalt Soul.

3033
01:56:32.993 --> 01:56:34.028
MARISHA: Sorry, yeah.

3034
01:56:34.028 --> 01:56:35.862
LIAM: First thing, actually, before we can do that,

3035
01:56:35.862 --> 01:56:38.020
the tower, how is it?

3036
01:56:39.388 --> 01:56:42.138
MATT: Make a perception check.
LIAM: Yeah.

3037
01:56:44.401 --> 01:56:45.453
That's pretty good.

3038
01:56:45.453 --> 01:56:47.070
That's 21.

3039
01:56:48.477 --> 01:56:51.429
MATT: 21? The tower is visible.

3040
01:56:51.429 --> 01:56:53.412
It's one of the larger spires,

3041
01:56:53.412 --> 01:56:55.383
one of the three Tri-Spires.

3042
01:56:55.383 --> 01:56:56.964
It appears to be standing and fine from this distance.

3043
01:56:56.964 --> 01:56:58.214
LIAM: So it's no longer (creaking).

3044
01:56:58.214 --> 01:57:01.904
MATT: It's no longer at an angle. It is straight up.

3045
01:57:01.904 --> 01:57:03.483
SAM: (singing) Straight up now tell me.

3046
01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:04.902
MATT: You know, this might actually be a good place

3047
01:57:04.902 --> 01:57:05.957
to take a break.

3048
01:57:05.957 --> 01:57:07.292
Because it is 9:00.

3049
01:57:07.292 --> 01:57:08.839
As you enter the city of Zadash,

3050
01:57:08.839 --> 01:57:11.771
gathering yourselves, getting your bearings straight,

3051
01:57:11.771 --> 01:57:14.327
and deciding which path to take

3052
01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:17.581
as you look upon the horizon, we're going to take a break.

3053
01:57:17.581 --> 01:57:18.968
We'll be back here in a few minutes,

3054
01:57:18.968 --> 01:57:22.682
but before we jump in, we do have our giveaway tonight.

3055
01:57:22.682 --> 01:57:23.567
Nice to be back.

3056
01:57:23.567 --> 01:57:24.769
Back to where things happened.

3057
01:57:24.769 --> 01:57:25.777
TALIESIN: Back to Zadash.

3058
01:57:25.777 --> 01:57:28.179
MATT: We do have, from our friends at Wyrmwood,

3059
01:57:28.179 --> 01:57:30.371
the newly redesigned hero vault

3060
01:57:30.371 --> 01:57:33.290
featuring art by our friends Devon Rue and Crystal Sully.

3061
01:57:33.290 --> 01:57:34.883
TRAVIS: Yeah, look at that.

3062
01:57:34.883 --> 01:57:36.280
MATT: Dragon head design right there,

3063
01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:38.777
this is the Crystal Sully design.

3064
01:57:38.777 --> 01:57:40.479
This is currently available through Wyrmwood's

3065
01:57:40.479 --> 01:57:41.739
Kickstarter campaigns, so go ahead and check it out

3066
01:57:41.739 --> 01:57:43.136
when you get a chance.

3067
01:57:43.136 --> 01:57:45.465
The keyword for tonight is homeward,

3068
01:57:45.465 --> 01:57:48.812
H-O-M-E-W-A-R-D, one word.

3069
01:57:48.812 --> 01:57:51.137
Enter only once, more than once, you'll be disqualified,

3070
01:57:51.137 --> 01:57:52.590
and once again, for folks in the US and Canada,

3071
01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:54.354
excluding Quebec. We'll be back here in a few minutes

3072
01:57:54.354 --> 01:57:55.698
with a winner.

3073
01:57:55.698 --> 01:57:56.548
We'll see you in just a moment.

3074
01:57:56.548 --> 01:57:57.846
SAM: Yay.

3075
01:57:57.846 --> 01:57:59.374

TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

3095
01:59:16.422 --> 01:59:18.249
BRIAN: Yeah, you know, the mosquitoes are crazy.

3096
01:59:18.249 --> 01:59:19.230
TRAVIS: Here, let me get that one.

3097
01:59:19.230 --> 01:59:20.727
BRIAN: Oh, that's so sweet.

3098
01:59:20.727 --> 01:59:24.102
Well, today, speaking of slapping,

3099
01:59:24.102 --> 01:59:26.780
we're playing Mortal Kombat 11,

3100
01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:28.833
and I think this one's probably going to be--

3101
01:59:28.833 --> 01:59:30.646
BRITTANY: Ahoy there.

3102
01:59:30.646 --> 01:59:34.694
State your names and your business here on the island, yarr.

3103
01:59:34.694 --> 01:59:38.451
TRAVIS: (laughs) I be Travis Willingham.

3104
01:59:38.451 --> 01:59:42.093
BRIAN: Yarr, and I be Brian Foster.

3105
01:59:42.093 --> 01:59:44.450
We're here to charge the game soul

3106
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:47.370
for the reunification of the gameverse. Who are you?

3107
01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:49.786
BRITTANY: I be Red Birb the Pirate.

3108
01:59:49.786 --> 01:59:51.456
TRAVIS: Yep.
BRIAN: Okay.

3109
01:59:51.456 --> 01:59:54.558
BRITTANY: Sultan of the Wagon Wheel Maelstrom,

3110
01:59:54.558 --> 01:59:56.687
King of the Fractured Seas.

3111
01:59:56.687 --> 01:59:57.520
TRAVIS: Fractured Seas?

3112
01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:00.677
BRITTANY: And Prince of Yee-Haw Water Ranch, yarr.

3113
02:00:00.677 --> 02:00:02.800
BRIAN: Did you say Yee-Haw Water Ranch?

3114
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:04.720
What are you doing all the way out here?

3115
02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.994
BRITTANY: I be lookin' for a relic buried

3116
02:00:06.994 --> 02:00:09.544
deep beneath the Nether Earth.

3117
02:00:09.544 --> 02:00:13.477
I believe it may be here on the island, yarr.

3118
02:00:13.477 --> 02:00:14.310
BRIAN: How cool, though,

3119
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:16.410
a pirate searching for buried treasure.

3120
02:00:16.410 --> 02:00:19.084
BRITTANY: Don't patronize me, you thin-bearded joy drain!

3121
02:00:19.084 --> 02:00:24.084
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3122
02:00:24.276 --> 02:00:28.926
BRITTANY: I be lookin' for a piece to an ancient weapon.

3123
02:00:28.926 --> 02:00:30.402
TRAVIS: Oh, now we're talkin'.

3124
02:00:30.402 --> 02:00:31.715
BRIAN: Holy shit, what an ancient weapon?

3125
02:00:31.715 --> 02:00:33.566
BRITTANY: Hey, crowbar mouth.

3126
02:00:33.566 --> 02:00:38.111
I'm talkin' to my matey here.
TRAVIS: Crowbar mouth!

3127
02:00:38.111 --> 02:00:40.922
And you said it's buried beneath the water,

3128
02:00:40.922 --> 02:00:43.414
the Nether Earth?
BRIAN: Yeah, Nether Earth.

3129
02:00:43.414 --> 02:00:45.397
BRITTANY: Yeah, the Nether Earth.

3130
02:00:45.397 --> 02:00:50.222
It be the dark world deep below the mud and big blue.

3131
02:00:50.222 --> 02:00:53.564
The space between the Dye'mor and Har'ah

3132
02:00:53.564 --> 02:00:55.907
and the six divine makers.

3133
02:00:55.907 --> 02:00:58.796
You must know this.

3134
02:00:58.796 --> 02:01:02.517
BRIAN: No, I don't know this! Dye'mor, the six divine makers?

3135
02:01:02.517 --> 02:01:03.687
TRAVIS: Spell those names.

3136
02:01:03.687 --> 02:01:06.662
BRITTANY: Well, I can't be wastin' my time talkin' to you.

3137
02:01:06.662 --> 02:01:09.273
It's time to find this new booty.

3138
02:01:09.273 --> 02:01:14.130
All right, boys, hop in the dinghies, and head to the shore.

3139
02:01:14.130 --> 02:01:15.754
TRAVIS: What dinghy?

3140
02:01:15.754 --> 02:01:17.851
Where's the boat?
BRIAN: I don't see any dinghies.

3141
02:01:17.851 --> 02:01:19.414
TRAVIS: Where'd she go?

3142
02:01:19.414 --> 02:01:21.006
TRAVIS: Both triggers.
BRIAN: I did.

3143
02:01:21.006 --> 02:01:22.262
TRAVIS: Oh, you must've missed it.

3144
02:01:22.262 --> 02:01:23.821
BRIAN: Oh, I missed it.

3145
02:01:23.821 --> 02:01:24.780
TRAVIS: There it is!

3146
02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:26.445
(exclaiming)

3147
02:01:26.445 --> 02:01:27.799
TRAVIS: Are you serious?!

3148
02:01:27.799 --> 02:01:30.243
BRIAN: Oh, that's unnecessary.

3149
02:01:30.243 --> 02:01:31.702
TRAVIS: Wow!

3150
02:01:31.702 --> 02:01:34.980
BRIAN: Oh no!
TRAVIS: How are you alive?!

3151
02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:37.250
BRIAN: But do you have a flag?

3152
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:39.022
TRAVIS: Now if you're thinking, watching at home,

3153
02:01:39.022 --> 02:01:41.153
oh, these button mashers are an absolute joke,

3154
02:01:41.153 --> 02:01:44.732
I could handle them any day of the week, you are right.

3155
02:01:44.732 --> 02:01:45.991
BRIAN: You're correct.

3156
02:01:45.991 --> 02:01:48.323
Yeah, we are buttmashers.

3157
02:01:48.323 --> 02:01:49.740
What did you say?

3158
02:01:50.952 --> 02:01:52.177
TRAVIS: Whoa.

3159
02:01:52.177 --> 02:01:53.696
Whoa!

3160
02:01:53.696 --> 02:01:56.450
Okay, I told you there was a second person.

3161
02:01:56.450 --> 02:01:58.955
BRIAN: I want to go to the bathroom and smoke some weed!

3162
02:01:58.955 --> 02:02:00.501
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3163
02:02:00.501 --> 02:02:02.217
Oh!

3164
02:02:03.645 --> 02:02:05.027
BRIAN: Whoa.

3165
02:02:05.027 --> 02:02:06.514
TRAVIS: I don't want that fatal blow action.

3166
02:02:06.514 --> 02:02:07.634
No!

3167
02:02:07.634 --> 02:02:09.092
No, no!

3168
02:02:09.092 --> 02:02:10.365
Oh wow.

3169
02:02:10.365 --> 02:02:12.730
BRIAN: Yeah, but look at how down my health is, though.

3170
02:02:12.730 --> 02:02:15.571
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

3171
02:02:15.571 --> 02:02:18.053
No, that is some pretty Keyleth sunbeam shit.

3172
02:02:18.053 --> 02:02:19.865
BRIAN: My health is so far down, dude.

3173
02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:22.149
TRAVIS: Down-four, down-X.

3174
02:02:25.684 --> 02:02:27.161
Oh!

3175
02:02:27.161 --> 02:02:29.828
(both shouting)

3176
02:02:32.106 --> 02:02:33.715
BRIAN: Jesus!

3177
02:02:33.715 --> 02:02:36.265
TRAVIS: Fatality!

3178
02:02:36.265 --> 02:02:38.615
Who knew he worked at a deli?

3179
02:02:38.615 --> 02:02:41.365
BRIAN: That was, yeah dude, eat fresh.

3180
02:02:42.871 --> 02:02:43.704
TRAVIS: Oh!

3181
02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:48.518
(both shouting)

3182
02:02:48.518 --> 02:02:52.513
MAN OFF-CAMERA: Down, down, down, triangle.

3183
02:02:52.513 --> 02:02:53.654
BRIAN: You dummy!

3184
02:02:53.654 --> 02:02:55.162
TRAVIS: You said down down!

3185
02:02:55.162 --> 02:02:56.545
BRIAN: He did say down three times.

3186
02:02:56.545 --> 02:03:01.545
(both laughing)

3187
02:03:02.008 --> 02:03:03.578
TRAVIS: Down, down, down, triangle.

3188
02:03:03.578 --> 02:03:06.246
Down four times, and triangle.

3189
02:03:06.246 --> 02:03:07.829
BRIAN: Pink.

3190
02:03:12.592 --> 02:03:15.342
(birds chirping)

3191
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:19.882
SAM: I'm a fan of hot air balloon rides

3192
02:03:19.882 --> 02:03:23.246
above the Venetian countryside.

3193
02:03:23.246 --> 02:03:27.640
I'm a fan of Momlan. She's always got my back.

3194
02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.207
I'm a fan of wine older than Taliesin.

3195
02:03:32.987 --> 02:03:35.820
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

3196
02:03:37.272 --> 02:03:41.189
I'm a fan of emotes by Arsequeef. They're neat.

3197
02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:46.337
I'm a fan of a wife so cool, people forget I exit.

3198
02:03:46.337 --> 02:03:51.337
(eerie music)
(birds cawing)

3199
02:03:52.223 --> 02:03:56.039
(explosions)
(beeping)

3200
02:03:56.039 --> 02:03:59.689
(eerie laughter)

3201
02:04:00.912 --> 02:04:04.539
(heartbeat pounding)

3202
02:04:04.539 --> 02:04:08.156
(baby crying)

3203
02:04:12.619 --> 02:04:17.494
SAM: I'm a fan of wearing your skin as a mask.

3204
02:04:21.055 --> 02:04:25.939
(dignified classical music)

3205
02:04:35.752 --> 02:04:40.752
(dramatic music)

3206
02:19:27.364 --> 02:19:29.066
MATT: Welcome back, everybody.

3207
02:19:29.066 --> 02:19:30.051
Wow.

3208
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:32.748
MARISHA: I learned some shit.

3209
02:19:32.748 --> 02:19:33.611
MATT: That was a lot.

3210
02:19:33.611 --> 02:19:36.271
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was very proud of that.

3211
02:19:36.271 --> 02:19:37.479
MATT: Give them 10 minutes of rest

3212
02:19:37.479 --> 02:19:40.211
and they come back swinging.

3213
02:19:40.211 --> 02:19:41.044
Before we get back into the game,

3214
02:19:41.044 --> 02:19:43.861
we do have our winner of the fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway.

3215
02:19:43.861 --> 02:19:46.007
The winner is Spector_VI.

3216
02:19:46.007 --> 02:19:48.773
Spector_VI, six.

3217
02:19:48.773 --> 02:19:51.019
Congratulations, we'll get that to you ASAP,

3218
02:19:51.019 --> 02:19:55.219
and enjoy your kickstarted awesome design.

3219
02:19:56.794 --> 02:20:00.808
Bringing it back, you guys are heading down the streets,

3220
02:20:00.808 --> 02:20:04.743
surrounded by the various hustle and bustle of Zadash.

3221
02:20:04.743 --> 02:20:09.737
The Crownsguard presence here is as you recall,

3222
02:20:09.737 --> 02:20:13.343
though you do see them mingled with small batches

3223
02:20:13.343 --> 02:20:15.873
of Righteous Brand that seem to have been

3224
02:20:15.873 --> 02:20:17.681
also given additional responsibilities

3225
02:20:17.681 --> 02:20:18.871
watching from the streets.

3226
02:20:18.871 --> 02:20:22.619
It feels a much more guarded atmosphere

3227
02:20:22.619 --> 02:20:25.105
than last time you were here, except for when

3228
02:20:25.105 --> 02:20:27.369
the war first began, so actually the last time you left,

3229
02:20:27.369 --> 02:20:29.460
it was about the same as where you recall,

3230
02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:30.844
if not a little bit more bolstered.

3231
02:20:30.844 --> 02:20:33.799
It looks like more soldiers are outside of the Marrow Keep

3232
02:20:33.799 --> 02:20:37.157
and are amongst the rest of the folk in the town.

3233
02:20:37.157 --> 02:20:40.132
TRAVIS: Apart from the numbers, just the body language,

3234
02:20:40.132 --> 02:20:42.934
do they look alert, frayed?

3235
02:20:42.934 --> 02:20:46.050
Maybe like a bloodbath just occurred a few days ago?

3236
02:20:46.050 --> 02:20:48.050
MATT: Make an insight check.

3237
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:50.917
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3238
02:20:50.917 --> 02:20:52.732
MARISHA: Oh, oh!

3239
02:20:52.732 --> 02:20:53.921
Look at that CR logo.

3240
02:20:53.921 --> 02:20:56.310
MATT: They do appear alert.

3241
02:20:56.310 --> 02:20:58.117
It isn't a day-to-day thing.

3242
02:20:58.117 --> 02:20:58.980
There are some that are,

3243
02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:01.435
some are just going about business, but

3244
02:21:01.435 --> 02:21:05.848
there is definitely a readiness to a lot of them.

3245
02:21:05.848 --> 02:21:10.846
Probably because just the current war with the Dynasty

3246
02:21:10.846 --> 02:21:14.721
has not been recently going in the Empire's favor,

3247
02:21:14.721 --> 02:21:18.175
and there was a recent possible attack

3248
02:21:18.175 --> 02:21:20.007
that may have caught their attention.

3249
02:21:20.007 --> 02:21:22.490
TRAVIS: They don't look gaunt, they look well-fed,

3250
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:23.732
still prepared?

3251
02:21:23.732 --> 02:21:25.759
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Organized, okay.

3252
02:21:25.759 --> 02:21:28.246
MARISHA: Is there a town crier shouting news?

3253
02:21:28.246 --> 02:21:29.319
LIAM: I was just going to ask.

3254
02:21:29.319 --> 02:21:30.395
MATT: Okay, yeah.

3255
02:21:30.395 --> 02:21:33.444
If you're listening out for that, make a perception check.

3256
02:21:35.036 --> 02:21:37.164
MARISHA: 13.
MATT: Okay.

3257
02:21:37.164 --> 02:21:38.611
LIAM: 19.

3258
02:21:38.611 --> 02:21:41.343
MATT: Okay, you do hear in the distance,

3259
02:21:41.343 --> 02:21:44.521
just a short ways into the city, some shouts off the way.

3260
02:21:44.521 --> 02:21:46.516
It's just far enough away where you don't pick up

3261
02:21:46.516 --> 02:21:47.921
the information, but you know the direction to go

3262
02:21:47.921 --> 02:21:50.027
to meet up with them, and so you push on

3263
02:21:50.027 --> 02:21:51.734
on horseback, not galloping through the streets,

3264
02:21:51.734 --> 02:21:52.891
because that's generally frowned upon

3265
02:21:52.891 --> 02:21:54.475
for the people that do cross the road often,

3266
02:21:54.475 --> 02:21:56.408
but you pick up your pace a bit to head that direction,

3267
02:21:56.408 --> 02:21:58.558
and you do hear the town crier going,

3268
02:21:58.558 --> 02:22:02.466
"Beware, recent incursions,

3269
02:22:02.466 --> 02:22:07.466
"attack on the Cobalt Soul!

3270
02:22:07.597 --> 02:22:09.764
"Still at large, murderers.

3271
02:22:11.524 --> 02:22:14.291
"See folks of strange mind or disposition,

3272
02:22:14.291 --> 02:22:16.792
"report to the Hall."

3273
02:22:16.792 --> 02:22:17.625
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3274
02:22:18.618 --> 02:22:21.198
MARISHA: Strange mind and disposition?

3275
02:22:21.198 --> 02:22:23.007
TRAVIS: Mind or disposition.

3276
02:22:23.007 --> 02:22:24.951
MARISHA: Oh, if you see weirdos, okay, okay.

3277
02:22:24.951 --> 02:22:27.134
Go to the TSA and report.

3278
02:22:27.134 --> 02:22:28.278
MATT: Essentially.

3279
02:22:28.278 --> 02:22:30.638
TALIESIN: Wow, we are just a walking red flag, aren't we?

3280
02:22:30.638 --> 02:22:32.888
MARISHA: Uh-huh, always.

3281
02:22:34.084 --> 02:22:34.999
All right.

3282
02:22:34.999 --> 02:22:35.899
MATT: Also starts shouting,

3283
02:22:35.899 --> 02:22:38.491
"War effort successfully mounting

3284
02:22:38.491 --> 02:22:39.843
"towards the east!"

3285
02:22:40.986 --> 02:22:42.481
TRAVIS: Horse shit.

3286
02:22:42.481 --> 02:22:44.081
(laughter)

3287
02:22:44.081 --> 02:22:45.414
I say to myself.

3288
02:22:47.389 --> 02:22:50.597
MATT: So what would you guys like to do?

3289
02:22:50.597 --> 02:22:51.631
TRAVIS: Straight to the Cobalt Soul.

3290
02:22:51.631 --> 02:22:52.809
MARISHA: To the Soul!

3291
02:22:52.809 --> 02:22:54.037
MATT: All righty.

3292
02:22:54.037 --> 02:22:55.582
You head your way to the Valley Archive

3293
02:22:55.582 --> 02:22:57.429
of the Cobalt Soul.

3294
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:59.538
Passing by the familiar territory,

3295
02:22:59.538 --> 02:23:01.879
you eventually come upon the beautiful structure

3296
02:23:01.879 --> 02:23:05.991
of the Archive, seemingly unscathed.

3297
02:23:05.991 --> 02:23:08.775
As busy as you would expect, though it does appear

3298
02:23:08.775 --> 02:23:12.602
like there are triple the number of townsguard

3299
02:23:12.602 --> 02:23:16.185
placed around the front and side entrances.

3300
02:23:18.502 --> 02:23:19.626
You approach?

3301
02:23:19.626 --> 02:23:20.526
MARISHA: Yep.

3302
02:23:20.526 --> 02:23:22.241
MATT: There is a hitching post, easy enough

3303
02:23:22.241 --> 02:23:24.859
to put your horses off to the side.

3304
02:23:24.859 --> 02:23:28.024
You approach, and there is

3305
02:23:28.024 --> 02:23:32.483
a robed Cobalt researcher outside who

3306
02:23:32.483 --> 02:23:35.379
glances upon your approach.

3307
02:23:35.379 --> 02:23:36.528
"Good day.

3308
02:23:36.528 --> 02:23:38.161
"Are you looking to ent--"

3309
02:23:38.161 --> 02:23:38.994
MARISHA: 'Sup.

3310
02:23:38.994 --> 02:23:40.934
MATT: "Beauregard, yes."

3311
02:23:40.934 --> 02:23:42.699
MARISHA: I'm back.

3312
02:23:42.699 --> 02:23:44.949
MATT: "Things have been a bit..."

3313
02:23:47.329 --> 02:23:48.315
MARISHA: Chaotic?

3314
02:23:48.315 --> 02:23:50.203
MATT: "Yes."
MARISHA: Yeah, I've heard.

3315
02:23:50.203 --> 02:23:52.189
MATT: "You've heard of the attack, then?"

3316
02:23:52.189 --> 02:23:53.047
MARISHA: Yeah.

3317
02:23:53.047 --> 02:23:54.755
MATT: "Right, right.

3318
02:23:54.755 --> 02:23:55.939
"How can I help you?"

3319
02:23:55.939 --> 02:23:58.371
MARISHA: I would like to come in and talk to people.

3320
02:23:58.371 --> 02:23:59.243
MATT: "Of course."

3321
02:23:59.243 --> 02:24:01.050
MARISHA: We have some shit to report.

3322
02:24:01.050 --> 02:24:02.060
MATT: "Yes, this way."

3323
02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:03.136
MARISHA: Been gone a long time, you know.

3324
02:24:03.136 --> 02:24:04.079
MATT: "Yes.

3325
02:24:04.079 --> 02:24:05.601
"Enter."

3326
02:24:05.601 --> 02:24:07.146
Leads you inside.

3327
02:24:07.146 --> 02:24:09.218
You head--
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

3328
02:24:09.218 --> 02:24:11.874
MATT: You head to the interior chamber.

3329
02:24:11.874 --> 02:24:14.379
You see two monks that are along the floor,

3330
02:24:14.379 --> 02:24:18.121
the marble floor, with brushes, they're scrubbing.

3331
02:24:18.121 --> 02:24:19.227
It's pretty clean.

3332
02:24:19.227 --> 02:24:20.878
You don't see a sign of the struggle previously,

3333
02:24:20.878 --> 02:24:23.679
they've had a number of days to recover from it,

3334
02:24:23.679 --> 02:24:27.942
but you do definitely confirm with sight

3335
02:24:27.942 --> 02:24:29.901
and the terminology that this is where the attack

3336
02:24:29.901 --> 02:24:32.139
seemed to occur, or at least an attack occurred.

3337
02:24:32.139 --> 02:24:33.649
TRAVIS: Just a slight reminder that perhaps--

3338
02:24:33.649 --> 02:24:34.657
LAURA: I just stare.

3339
02:24:34.657 --> 02:24:36.541
TRAVIS: These people might have lost someone close to them.

3340
02:24:36.541 --> 02:24:39.330
You know, so maybe tone down the brash

3341
02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:42.457
MARISHA: Yeah, I probably lost someone close to me.

3342
02:24:42.457 --> 02:24:44.119
Maybe.
TRAVIS: Right, yes.

3343
02:24:44.119 --> 02:24:46.614
MARISHA: Find out who died.

3344
02:24:47.489 --> 02:24:48.333
All right.

3345
02:24:48.333 --> 02:24:52.522
LIAM: Hey DM, how many days did it take to get here?

3346
02:24:52.522 --> 02:24:54.605
MATT: Total, would've been...

3347
02:24:58.479 --> 02:25:03.379
13 and a half days from Nicodranas.

3348
02:25:04.807 --> 02:25:06.816
TALIESIN: Almost two weeks.

3349
02:25:06.816 --> 02:25:07.792
Not bad.

3350
02:25:07.792 --> 02:25:08.792
TRAVIS: Two weeks.

3351
02:25:09.862 --> 02:25:11.556
MARISHA: Geographical oddity.

3352
02:25:11.556 --> 02:25:13.330
SAM: Who can we talk to here?

3353
02:25:13.330 --> 02:25:14.725
MARISHA: I'm going to look around and see if I can find

3354
02:25:14.725 --> 02:25:19.358
Zeenoth or, fuck, who's the other guy who taught me?

3355
02:25:22.097 --> 02:25:23.468
LIAM: Oh, right.

3356
02:25:23.468 --> 02:25:25.070
The one you sparred with.

3357
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.903
MARISHA: Yeah.

3358
02:25:26.749 --> 02:25:28.223
LIAM: He was a halfling, right?

3359
02:25:28.223 --> 02:25:29.056
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3360
02:25:30.324 --> 02:25:34.372
He stepped in after Dairon left.

3361
02:25:34.372 --> 02:25:36.211
(clears throat)

3362
02:25:37.119 --> 02:25:39.432
Well, as you're having this conversation

3363
02:25:39.432 --> 02:25:43.349
or asking around, the figure who helped you in,

3364
02:25:44.321 --> 02:25:47.786
which looking upon you can see short blond hair,

3365
02:25:47.786 --> 02:25:50.677
appears to be half-elf.

3366
02:25:50.677 --> 02:25:54.131
Leaning more on the human than half-elf side a bit.

3367
02:25:54.131 --> 02:25:58.399
Young and seems a bit shaken visibly

3368
02:25:58.399 --> 02:25:59.642
by the recent events and is just trying to

3369
02:25:59.642 --> 02:26:00.918
hold it together.

3370
02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:02.895
Hears you mention Zeenoth and goes,

3371
02:26:02.895 --> 02:26:07.511
"Oh, yeah, Zeenoth is recovering.

3372
02:26:07.511 --> 02:26:11.135
"He was gravely wounded in the attack.

3373
02:26:11.135 --> 02:26:14.777
"I could go and check and see if he's up for visitors."

3374
02:26:14.777 --> 02:26:15.973
MARISHA: Would you?

3375
02:26:15.973 --> 02:26:17.159
What's your name?

3376
02:26:17.159 --> 02:26:20.466
MATT: "I'm Galesh. I've heard of you."

3377
02:26:20.466 --> 02:26:21.500
MARISHA: Really?

3378
02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:23.060
(laughter)

3379
02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:23.893
MATT: "Yes."

3380
02:26:25.413 --> 02:26:27.459
MARISHA: What have you heard?

3381
02:26:27.459 --> 02:26:30.796
MATT: "I've just heard, you've been used as an example

3382
02:26:30.796 --> 02:26:33.774
"in conversations."
MARISHA: Oh, god.

3383
02:26:33.774 --> 02:26:34.607
Okay.

3384
02:26:36.781 --> 02:26:39.614
Yeah, do me a favor, Ganache.

3385
02:26:39.614 --> 02:26:41.013
Ganache? Ganesh.
MATT: "Galesh."

3386
02:26:41.013 --> 02:26:42.487
MARISHA: Galesh.

3387
02:26:42.487 --> 02:26:44.781
Do me a favor, Ganache, and go check in.

3388
02:26:44.781 --> 02:26:46.715
MATT: "Right."

3389
02:26:46.715 --> 02:26:48.323
TALIESIN: Power move there, well done.

3390
02:26:48.323 --> 02:26:50.652
MATT: Sets off, and you can see there are a number

3391
02:26:50.652 --> 02:26:52.666
of various monks and clerics and other people

3392
02:26:52.666 --> 02:26:57.216
that work within the Archive that are just watching you all.

3393
02:26:57.216 --> 02:26:59.245
You know, generally part of the business in here

3394
02:26:59.245 --> 02:27:02.852
is to keep an eye on anybody who is an outsider,

3395
02:27:02.852 --> 02:27:05.408
even in the presence of Beauregard here,

3396
02:27:05.408 --> 02:27:07.567
with recent events, there is a general nervousness

3397
02:27:07.567 --> 02:27:10.633
and a close watch just in case.

3398
02:27:13.733 --> 02:27:18.066
A short time goes by before Galesh returns and goes,

3399
02:27:19.913 --> 02:27:22.604
"He can speak with you, if you want to follow."

3400
02:27:22.604 --> 02:27:24.826
MARISHA: Yeah. Come on.

3401
02:27:27.281 --> 02:27:29.581
TRAVIS: We follow.
TALIESIN: Oh yes, we follow.

3402
02:27:30.598 --> 02:27:32.981
MATT: You follow Galesh

3403
02:27:32.981 --> 02:27:36.125
down the hallway to one of the rooms

3404
02:27:36.125 --> 02:27:38.668
for the infirmed, which is used for injuries

3405
02:27:38.668 --> 02:27:42.322
and general recovery for anybody who's been hurt,

3406
02:27:42.322 --> 02:27:43.778
you know, people fall off ladders

3407
02:27:43.778 --> 02:27:46.214
and stuff here occasionally, it's a very very

3408
02:27:46.214 --> 02:27:50.227
high-tier library and things are prone to happen.

3409
02:27:50.227 --> 02:27:54.872
In one of the beds, you can see there is Zeenoth,

3410
02:27:54.872 --> 02:27:57.997
who is still bandaged, you know,

3411
02:27:57.997 --> 02:28:01.841
thanks to magical healing, terrible grievous wounds

3412
02:28:01.841 --> 02:28:03.727
can be recovered in a short time,

3413
02:28:03.727 --> 02:28:06.692
and based on where he's still at in the time that it's been,

3414
02:28:06.692 --> 02:28:11.235
you gather he narrowly escaped with his life.

3415
02:28:11.235 --> 02:28:12.068
TRAVIS: Fuck.

3416
02:28:13.548 --> 02:28:18.548
MATT: Zeenoth leans forward and, "(groans), Beauregard."

3417
02:28:18.984 --> 02:28:20.234
MARISHA: Hey, Zeenoth.

3418
02:28:21.114 --> 02:28:24.561
MATT: "I wasn't expecting to see you."

3419
02:28:24.561 --> 02:28:26.051
MARISHA: Yeah, we peeked in and we saw

3420
02:28:26.051 --> 02:28:28.804
that things were tits-up, so.

3421
02:28:28.804 --> 02:28:33.765
MATT: "Yes, it's been a problematic few weeks."

3422
02:28:33.765 --> 02:28:36.232
MARISHA: How many did we lose?

3423
02:28:36.232 --> 02:28:37.482
MATT: "We lost nine."

3424
02:28:38.884 --> 02:28:40.521
MARISHA: Nine, okay.

3425
02:28:40.521 --> 02:28:42.421
MATT: "Others were wounded, myself included.

3426
02:28:42.421 --> 02:28:45.927
"I'm very very thankful to still be here.

3427
02:28:45.927 --> 02:28:50.927
"By the grace of Ioun, I still walk among us."

3428
02:28:51.204 --> 02:28:53.787
LAURA: Who was it that attacked you?

3429
02:28:55.233 --> 02:28:56.733
MATT: "I'm not certain.

3430
02:28:58.401 --> 02:29:02.818
"Somebody masquerading as one of our own came through.

3431
02:29:04.948 --> 02:29:08.748
"This terrifying,

3432
02:29:08.748 --> 02:29:13.023
"murderous behemoth just began to

3433
02:29:13.023 --> 02:29:14.476
"cut through,

3434
02:29:14.476 --> 02:29:18.401
"and another,

3435
02:29:18.401 --> 02:29:23.401
"seemingly driven by anger and madness.

3436
02:29:23.542 --> 02:29:27.857
"We were caught off-guard, and were forced to try

3437
02:29:27.857 --> 02:29:31.161
"and guide them to a specific chamber,

3438
02:29:31.161 --> 02:29:34.277
"and I resisted and was gutted for it."

3439
02:29:34.277 --> 02:29:35.365
You can see he tries to sit up,

3440
02:29:35.365 --> 02:29:38.229
there's these heavily crimson bandages

3441
02:29:38.229 --> 02:29:40.021
across the midsection.

3442
02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:43.858
"I'm mostly recovered now.

3443
02:29:43.858 --> 02:29:48.024
"This is a bit macabre at glance, but I'm--"

3444
02:29:48.024 --> 02:29:50.620
LAURA: You really should get that changed
if you're healed up.

3445
02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:53.595
I mean, why are you sitting in old blood?

3446
02:29:53.595 --> 02:29:58.492
MATT: "It's been a few days of heavy sleep recently.

3447
02:29:58.492 --> 02:29:59.989
"But--"

3448
02:29:59.989 --> 02:30:02.768
MARISHA: What chamber, what were they looking for?

3449
02:30:02.768 --> 02:30:04.851
What did they leave with?

3450
02:30:05.799 --> 02:30:09.180
MATT: "Well, the man said he was a representative

3451
02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:14.165
"of the Rexxentrum Archive, on business with the war effort.

3452
02:30:14.165 --> 02:30:18.207
"Something didn't sit right when I first saw him."

3453
02:30:18.207 --> 02:30:19.457
LAURA: Was he blond?

3454
02:30:20.589 --> 02:30:22.012
MATT: "No, darker hair."

3455
02:30:22.012 --> 02:30:23.542
LAURA: Oh.

3456
02:30:23.542 --> 02:30:27.617
MATT: "I questioned him at the repository door, below,

3457
02:30:27.617 --> 02:30:29.656
"and he whistled loudly, and that's when the footfalls came

3458
02:30:29.656 --> 02:30:33.239
"of the other two. Screams. So many screams.

3459
02:30:36.681 --> 02:30:38.621
"I did not recognize him.

3460
02:30:38.621 --> 02:30:40.273
"I can show you to where he was--"
SAM: (sneezes)

3461
02:30:40.273 --> 02:30:41.482
MATT: "Bless you."

3462
02:30:41.482 --> 02:30:42.315
SAM: Excuse me.

3463
02:30:43.287 --> 02:30:47.377
"I can show you to where he asked me to take him."

3464
02:30:47.377 --> 02:30:48.210
MARISHA: Yeah.

3465
02:30:49.085 --> 02:30:50.570
TRAVIS: Can we help you at all?

3466
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:51.558
MATT: "I'm fine, I'm fine."

3467
02:30:51.558 --> 02:30:53.558
MARISHA: Yeah, let us help you.

3468
02:30:55.212 --> 02:30:56.045
MATT: "(sighs)"

3469
02:30:56.045 --> 02:30:58.613
He leans on your shoulder a bit.

3470
02:30:58.613 --> 02:31:01.261
Takes you out to the downward spiral staircase

3471
02:31:01.261 --> 02:31:03.034
that leads to the subterranean repository.

3472
02:31:03.034 --> 02:31:07.019
This is where the extremely rare,

3473
02:31:07.019 --> 02:31:10.645
singular-copy books are kept.

3474
02:31:10.645 --> 02:31:13.631
Things that have very dangerous information

3475
02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:18.548
that the Cobalt Soul keeps under very careful lock and key.

3476
02:31:23.549 --> 02:31:28.535
"I'm not entirely certain directly what he was looking for.

3477
02:31:28.535 --> 02:31:31.731
"He was just asking to be brought here.

3478
02:31:31.731 --> 02:31:33.767
"I've been out for most of this time,

3479
02:31:33.767 --> 02:31:36.310
"perhaps some of the other individuals can help you.

3480
02:31:36.310 --> 02:31:39.023
"They've been doing their investigations about."

3481
02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:41.567
TRAVIS: Doing an inventory of
anything that might be missing?

3482
02:31:41.567 --> 02:31:42.872
MATT: "Yes, if you wish to ask."

3483
02:31:42.872 --> 02:31:44.769
MARISHA: Who should I talk to?

3484
02:31:44.769 --> 02:31:47.070
MATT: He points to any of the other monks

3485
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:48.814
who are in the process of making notes

3486
02:31:48.814 --> 02:31:50.013
and pointing through the various tomes.

3487
02:31:50.013 --> 02:31:52.014
LAURA: Do I recognize the rooms at all that we're in?

3488
02:31:52.014 --> 02:31:56.448
MATT: This is the room where you
saw Yasha at the doorway of.

3489
02:31:56.448 --> 02:31:57.515
LAURA: And him sitting at a table?

3490
02:31:57.515 --> 02:31:59.606
MATT: Him standing at the table with a book

3491
02:31:59.606 --> 02:32:00.815
he's a been thumbing through, yeah.

3492
02:32:00.815 --> 02:32:03.871
LAURA: Do I remember what the book looked like?

3493
02:32:03.871 --> 02:32:05.379
MATT: You do.

3494
02:32:05.379 --> 02:32:07.762
LAURA: Can I describe it to--
MATT: Yeah.

3495
02:32:07.762 --> 02:32:09.211
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Two of them listen,

3496
02:32:09.211 --> 02:32:12.428
and they begin to thumb through,

3497
02:32:12.428 --> 02:32:14.868
and eventually come to a blank spot

3498
02:32:14.868 --> 02:32:17.634
where the book is missing.

3499
02:32:17.634 --> 02:32:19.611
SAM: What was it?

3500
02:32:19.611 --> 02:32:21.733
MARISHA: Yeah, I holler to somebody.

3501
02:32:21.733 --> 02:32:23.495
What was here?

3502
02:32:23.495 --> 02:32:27.912
MATT: "This particular tome was specifically talking about

3503
02:32:29.219 --> 02:32:34.219
"the historical significance of and recordkeeping of

3504
02:32:34.228 --> 02:32:38.713
"various terrifying entities that were involved

3505
02:32:38.713 --> 02:32:43.713
"in various deific conflicts.

"Spoke of celestial entities and angels

"and twisted, corrupted creatures and beings

3508
02:32:53.853 --> 02:32:56.064
"that were put and bound to the service

3509
02:32:56.064 --> 02:32:59.178
"of Betrayer Gods, as well as some of

02:32:59.178 --> 02:33:01.956
"the Prime Deities themselves.

3511
02:33:01.956 --> 02:33:06.956
"It was cobbled together from various different sources."

3512
02:33:07.266 --> 02:33:10.066
LAURA: An Angel in Irons?

3513
02:33:12.065 --> 02:33:14.891
MATT: "I don't know if that was this particular tome.

3514
02:33:14.891 --> 02:33:16.016
"We can go and research, if you'd like,

3515
02:33:16.016 --> 02:33:17.210
"or if you'd like to research, you can."

3516
02:33:17.210 --> 02:33:18.511
MARISHA: Anything about the Laughing Hand?

3517
02:33:18.511 --> 02:33:20.209
And yes, we will be doing our research,

3518
02:33:20.209 --> 02:33:23.136
but I figured you could give me a footnotes version

3519
02:33:23.136 --> 02:33:25.563
of what you have thus far?

3520
02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:26.942
MATT: "I don't recall anything about the Laughing Hand,

3521
02:33:26.942 --> 02:33:30.164
"but my specialty is only this particular section

3522
02:33:30.164 --> 02:33:33.143
"of the room. We can't all know all the information,

3523
02:33:33.143 --> 02:33:37.338
"so we have assigned different regions of the Archive

3524
02:33:37.338 --> 02:33:39.073
"that we look over, specifically."

3525
02:33:39.073 --> 02:33:40.814
LIAM: Is there anyone in the library who is

3526
02:33:40.814 --> 02:33:43.690
specifically acquainted with this tome?

3527
02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:45.848
MATT: "That would be me."

3528
02:33:45.848 --> 02:33:47.145
LIAM: You, okay.

3529
02:33:47.145 --> 02:33:50.764
MARISHA: Was there any spells, any hints of gateways,

3530
02:33:50.764 --> 02:33:53.478
information where things-- do you remember any of that

3531
02:33:53.478 --> 02:33:55.024
from this tome?

3532
02:33:55.024 --> 02:33:56.923
MATT: "No.

3533
02:33:56.923 --> 02:33:59.743
"I mean, it was mostly vocal.

3534
02:33:59.743 --> 02:34:01.092
"It wasn't any specific studies.

3535
02:34:01.092 --> 02:34:03.529
"It was, you know, word of mouth, bits of information,

3536
02:34:03.529 --> 02:34:06.277
"historical scraps that were passed down.

3537
02:34:06.277 --> 02:34:09.793
"Many of it was just considered myth or story."

3538
02:34:09.793 --> 02:34:12.426
TRAVIS: A singular book, right?

3539
02:34:12.426 --> 02:34:14.467
There wasn't a pair or a series of these,

3540
02:34:14.467 --> 02:34:15.425
it was just a collection?

3541
02:34:15.425 --> 02:34:16.590
MATT: "It was one in particular, and it was thin,

3542
02:34:16.590 --> 02:34:18.819
"it wasn't an extensive tome."

3543
02:34:18.819 --> 02:34:20.794
TRAVIS: I know that many were lost here.

3544
02:34:20.794 --> 02:34:22.477
Do you know how they exited?

3545
02:34:22.477 --> 02:34:23.310
How they left?

3546
02:34:23.310 --> 02:34:24.708
MATT: "No, just without a trace.

3547
02:34:24.708 --> 02:34:27.884
"I assume it was some form of teleportation."

3548
02:34:27.884 --> 02:34:30.688
TALIESIN: Did this book cover the King that Crawls?

3549
02:34:30.688 --> 02:34:33.287
MATT: "It may have.

3550
02:34:33.287 --> 02:34:38.191
"It covered many things. I don't--

3551
02:34:38.191 --> 02:34:40.001
"We archive and maintain them;

3552
02:34:40.001 --> 02:34:43.221
"we do not memorize the contents of these tomes.

3553
02:34:43.221 --> 02:34:45.496
"We just know where to find them and when the research

3554
02:34:45.496 --> 02:34:50.315
"is necessary, we go and locate them and then discover it."

3555
02:34:50.315 --> 02:34:51.956
TALIESIN: Do the records have anybody else

3556
02:34:51.956 --> 02:34:55.509
going into this book in the last few years?

3557
02:34:55.509 --> 02:34:57.958
MATT: "We've looked into it, it hasn't been

3558
02:34:57.958 --> 02:35:02.509
"specifically looked into for at least 20 to 25.

3559
02:35:02.509 --> 02:35:04.736
"It's sparse knowledge."

3560
02:35:04.736 --> 02:35:09.454
SAM: The tall woman with the sword, I assume.

3561
02:35:09.454 --> 02:35:10.466
MATT: "Yes?"

3562
02:35:10.466 --> 02:35:11.652
SAM: Did she say anything?

3563
02:35:11.652 --> 02:35:16.652
Did she act of her own volition, or was she commanded?

3564
02:35:16.961 --> 02:35:20.232
MATT: "I mean, she said not a word while she was here."

3565
02:35:20.232 --> 02:35:22.066
LAURA: She was crying.

3566
02:35:26.802 --> 02:35:31.727
MATT: "Anyway, if you wish to look about the books here,

3567
02:35:31.727 --> 02:35:36.219
"we can assign a few aids and help you find what you seek."

3568
02:35:36.219 --> 02:35:37.583
LIAM: That would be extremely helpful.

3569
02:35:37.583 --> 02:35:39.930
TRAVIS: Anything else was reported missing

3570
02:35:39.930 --> 02:35:42.222
besides this particular book?

3571
02:35:42.222 --> 02:35:44.275
MATT: "We've looked over it quite extensively,

3572
02:35:44.275 --> 02:35:45.808
"and this is the only tome missing."

3573
02:35:45.808 --> 02:35:46.649
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3574
02:35:46.649 --> 02:35:47.890
MARISHA: What's your name?

3575
02:35:47.890 --> 02:35:49.828
MATT: "My name is Delan.

3576
02:35:49.828 --> 02:35:51.754
"I've been here for quite some time."

3577
02:35:51.754 --> 02:35:55.078
MARISHA: Oh, I think I met him before.

3578
02:35:55.078 --> 02:35:55.956
No, no.

3579
02:35:55.956 --> 02:35:57.698
MATT: I don't think you've met Delan.

3580
02:35:59.313 --> 02:36:00.779
You didn't spend much time in the repositories,

3581
02:36:00.779 --> 02:36:04.242
so you wouldn't have encountered him too often.

3582
02:36:04.242 --> 02:36:05.380
"Yes, if there's any particular topics

3583
02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:07.762
"you'd like to research, we can look into that."

3584
02:36:07.762 --> 02:36:09.359
SAM: What do we want to research?

3585
02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:11.723
MATT: You have an entire archive at your disposal,

3586
02:36:11.723 --> 02:36:14.495
so if there's anything you want to try and look up.

3587
02:36:14.495 --> 02:36:16.327
MARISHA: All of it.

3588
02:36:16.327 --> 02:36:19.041
MATT: I mean, pick some topics.

3589
02:36:19.041 --> 02:36:20.237
LAURA: Jesus.

3590
02:36:20.237 --> 02:36:22.166
TRAVIS: Swamps in Xhorhas.

3591
02:36:22.166 --> 02:36:24.065
TALIESIN: Angel of Irons.

3592
02:36:24.065 --> 02:36:25.071
LAURA: Yeah, the angel.

3593
02:36:25.071 --> 02:36:28.263
MARISHA: Anything about summoning the Crawling King,

3594
02:36:28.263 --> 02:36:31.281
anything about the Crawling King, or--

3595
02:36:31.281 --> 02:36:33.189
MATT: Okay, which one? You're picking multiple topics here.

3596
02:36:33.189 --> 02:36:35.627
Which one you want to research first?

3597
02:36:35.627 --> 02:36:37.427
LAURA: Gosh, we're treating Matt like he's Google.

3598
02:36:37.427 --> 02:36:39.446
This is crazy.

3599
02:36:39.446 --> 02:36:40.279
SAM: Crawling King.

3600
02:36:40.279 --> 02:36:42.090
TALIESIN: I want to find a good Thai restaurant

3601
02:36:42.090 --> 02:36:44.765
that's at least got four stars.

3602
02:36:44.765 --> 02:36:45.825
Three miles.

3603
02:36:45.825 --> 02:36:47.716
LAURA: I think we should look up if there's anything about

3604
02:36:47.716 --> 02:36:49.960
the Angel of Irons, because--

3605
02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:51.813
TALIESIN: We don't know anything.
LAURA: Yeah.

3606
02:36:51.813 --> 02:36:54.088
It's like a group, a cult, right?

3607
02:36:54.088 --> 02:36:55.783
A following.

3608
02:36:55.783 --> 02:37:00.782
MARISHA: It sounds like fallen angels,

3609
02:37:00.782 --> 02:37:02.652
or celestial beings.

3610
02:37:02.652 --> 02:37:04.724
TALIESIN: Angel of Irons or I would say the Laughing--

3611
02:37:04.724 --> 02:37:06.526
LAURA: The Laughing Hand.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3612
02:37:06.526 --> 02:37:08.612
MATT: Okay, so which one are you researching first?

3613
02:37:08.612 --> 02:37:10.582
MARISHA: Crawling King, let's do that first.

3614
02:37:10.582 --> 02:37:12.445
MATT: All right, and who's researching that?

3615
02:37:12.445 --> 02:37:14.041
SAM: Caleb!

3616
02:37:14.041 --> 02:37:17.222
LIAM: Hmm.

3617
02:37:17.222 --> 02:37:18.546
MARISHA: I'll research that.

3618
02:37:18.546 --> 02:37:19.598
LIAM: Yes, yes.

3619
02:37:19.598 --> 02:37:20.961
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check for me.

3620
02:37:20.961 --> 02:37:22.615
LAURA: Guidance.

3621
02:37:22.615 --> 02:37:24.538
Oh, oh, oh, wait, hold on.

3622
02:37:24.538 --> 02:37:28.510
I'm going to cast Enhance Ability.

3623
02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:29.800
MARISHA: Ooh yes.

3624
02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:31.410
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it to Caleb.

3625
02:37:31.410 --> 02:37:33.840
LAURA: I'm going to do it, it's an intelligence check,

3626
02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:35.867
I'm going to cast Fox's Cunning on you.

3627
02:37:35.867 --> 02:37:38.083
MARISHA: Yeah, sweet.

3628
02:37:38.083 --> 02:37:40.758
MATT: That's advantage on intelligence checks for you.

3629
02:37:40.758 --> 02:37:42.180
You doing the same for Caleb?

3630
02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:44.452
All right.

3631
02:37:45.485 --> 02:37:46.621
LAURA: And Guidance.

3632
02:37:46.621 --> 02:37:48.878
MARISHA: And Guidance, okay, okay.

3633
02:37:48.878 --> 02:37:51.516
LAURA: Wait, let me double-check
and make sure Guidance is not--

3634
02:37:51.516 --> 02:37:52.816
TALIESIN: It's concentration.

3635
02:37:52.816 --> 02:37:54.221
LAURA: Oh, never mind, no Guidance for you.

3636
02:37:54.221 --> 02:37:55.138
MARISHA: Okay.

3637
02:37:55.138 --> 02:37:56.494
Investigation, you said?

3638
02:37:56.494 --> 02:37:57.327
MATT: Correct.

3639
02:37:57.327 --> 02:37:58.160
MARISHA: 16.

3640
02:37:58.160 --> 02:37:59.854
MATT: 16, okay.

3641
02:37:59.854 --> 02:38:02.089
You do find a number of books that refer to Torog.

3642
02:38:02.089 --> 02:38:04.183
Torog the Crawling King, the dark god

3643
02:38:04.183 --> 02:38:08.068
of the endless tunnels and caverns beneath Exandria,

3644
02:38:08.068 --> 02:38:10.484
Torog is the patron of torturers, slavers, and jailers

3645
02:38:10.484 --> 02:38:12.459
across the realms.

3646
02:38:12.459 --> 02:38:14.267
His violent terrors carve the pathways under the world

3647
02:38:14.267 --> 02:38:16.638
and his realm of imprisonment is a network

3648
02:38:16.638 --> 02:38:19.627
of deadly caves and manacles from which few return.

3649
02:38:19.627 --> 02:38:21.601
Creatures that wander the desolation of Carceri

3650
02:38:21.601 --> 02:38:23.523
often construct prisons in his image.

3651
02:38:23.523 --> 02:38:25.231
MARISHA: Carceri?
MATT: Carceri.

3652
02:38:25.231 --> 02:38:26.064
SAM: Carceri.

3653
02:38:26.064 --> 02:38:28.216
MATT: C-A-R-C-E-R-I.

3654
02:38:28.216 --> 02:38:29.712
Those who rob others of their freedom

3655
02:38:29.712 --> 02:38:31.170
offer prayers to him in cellars

3656
02:38:31.170 --> 02:38:32.255
and other subterranean domains.

3657
02:38:32.255 --> 02:38:34.394
Many creatures who live in the darkness below

3658
02:38:34.394 --> 02:38:37.422
worship him and seek his guidance.

3659
02:38:37.422 --> 02:38:39.634
He is said to have been banished within

3660
02:38:39.634 --> 02:38:42.415
an unknown sliver of the Far Realm,

3661
02:38:42.415 --> 02:38:45.371
where he now borders the deepest pits of the Underdark.

3662
02:38:45.371 --> 02:38:46.972
Where the boundaries between worlds grow thin

3663
02:38:46.972 --> 02:38:51.242
and birth terrible abominations bent on subjugation.

3664
02:38:51.242 --> 02:38:54.134
MARISHA: To a sliver of the Underdark, or a sliver--

3665
02:38:54.134 --> 02:38:55.684
MATT: A sliver of the Far Realm that borders

3666
02:38:55.684 --> 02:38:58.319
the deepest pits of the Underdark.

3667
02:38:58.319 --> 02:39:00.819
LIAM: So Underdark to get to--?

3668
02:39:01.675 --> 02:39:03.384
TRAVIS: We were just in a part of the Underdark

3669
02:39:03.384 --> 02:39:07.367
with our big-ass gate, somebody got squished.

3670
02:39:09.418 --> 02:39:13.305
LIAM: I don't think we were in
the Underdark in this campaign.

3671
02:39:13.305 --> 02:39:15.459
Underground, but not Underdark.

3672
02:39:15.459 --> 02:39:17.373
MATT: There are many tales of battles and wars,

3673
02:39:17.373 --> 02:39:20.248
including the one where Torog was initially banished

3674
02:39:20.248 --> 02:39:25.248
by a union of Pelor the Dawnfather and Rae the Everlight.

3675
02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:27.059
MARISHA: Right.

3676
02:39:27.059 --> 02:39:28.976
MATT: That managed to push him beyond the boundaries

3677
02:39:28.976 --> 02:39:30.694
of Exandria into the Far Realm,

3678
02:39:30.694 --> 02:39:33.671
where he has supposedly remained to this day.

3679
02:39:33.671 --> 02:39:36.024
TRAVIS: Where is the Far Realm?

3680
02:39:36.024 --> 02:39:38.016
MARISHA: Yeah, what's the Far Realm?

3681
02:39:38.016 --> 02:39:40.746
TRAVIS: What is that? Is that another dimension or a place?

3682
02:39:40.746 --> 02:39:44.350
MATT: If you would like to-- for you, I'd say

3683
02:39:44.350 --> 02:39:47.445
either make a religion or arcana check for you.

3684
02:39:47.445 --> 02:39:48.835
LIAM: Are you reading privately or are you like

3685
02:39:48.835 --> 02:39:50.342
sharing with the group as you go?

3686
02:39:50.342 --> 02:39:51.878
MARISHA: I would be yelling shit out.

3687
02:39:51.878 --> 02:39:54.975
LAURA: You get advantage on it, by the way.

3688
02:39:54.975 --> 02:39:56.741
MARISHA: It's still intelligence.

3689
02:39:56.741 --> 02:39:59.266
TALIESIN: And you as well, Liam.

3690
02:40:00.182 --> 02:40:01.629
LIAM: Enhance Ability gives what?

3691
02:40:01.629 --> 02:40:03.335
TALIESIN: You have advantage on any intelligence-based

3692
02:40:03.335 --> 02:40:04.934
ability checks.
LIAM: Oh, cool.

3693
02:40:04.934 --> 02:40:07.476
TALIESIN: For an hour.

3694
02:40:07.476 --> 02:40:11.482
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait,
not investigation but religion. 18.

3695
02:40:11.482 --> 02:40:13.103
MATT: Religion is wisdom, I believe, right?

3696
02:40:13.103 --> 02:40:13.936
Or is it intelligence?

3697
02:40:13.936 --> 02:40:14.769
MARISHA: No, that's intelligence.

3698
02:40:14.769 --> 02:40:15.602
MATT: Intelligence, all right, never mind,
sorry, you're right.

3699
02:40:15.602 --> 02:40:16.565
MARISHA: 18.

3700
02:40:17.843 --> 02:40:22.843
MATT: The Far Realm has been studied

3701
02:40:22.843 --> 02:40:25.100
as much as it can.

3702
02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:26.850
It is a space,

3703
02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:30.991
a plane outside of the general spheres

3704
02:40:30.991 --> 02:40:35.991
of known existence, that is so alien,

3705
02:40:36.082 --> 02:40:38.415
that is so strange

3706
02:40:38.415 --> 02:40:41.170
and dangerous that to peer deep into it

3707
02:40:41.170 --> 02:40:43.549
is to welcome madness into the mind.

3708
02:40:43.549 --> 02:40:44.822
TALIESIN: I want to go there now.

3709
02:40:44.822 --> 02:40:46.030
(laughter)

3710
02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:48.416
TRAVIS: Let's go there next.

3711
02:40:48.416 --> 02:40:50.721
MATT: It is said those who nightmare on its borders

3712
02:40:50.721 --> 02:40:54.108
sometimes dream things into being.

3713
02:40:54.108 --> 02:40:56.566
Terrible formless ancient creatures that may have existed

3714
02:40:56.566 --> 02:40:58.498
before Exandria itself.

3715
02:40:58.498 --> 02:41:01.327
MARISHA: That's exactly what they're trying to do, right?

3716
02:41:01.327 --> 02:41:02.840
Like dream him back, maybe?

3717
02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:06.923
MATT: There are such creatures as beholders and aboleths

3718
02:41:06.923 --> 02:41:10.460
and things are theorized to have been spawned from

3719
02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:13.286
or originated from the Far Realm.

3720
02:41:13.286 --> 02:41:14.201
LAURA: Whoa.

3721
02:41:14.201 --> 02:41:15.862
TRAVIS: In people's nightmares?

3722
02:41:15.862 --> 02:41:16.891
LAURA: Creepy.

3723
02:41:16.891 --> 02:41:18.090
SAM: To the Far Realm!

3724
02:41:18.090 --> 02:41:19.244
(laughter)

3725
02:41:19.244 --> 02:41:20.874
MATT: Sure, what could possibly go wrong?

3726
02:41:20.874 --> 02:41:22.325
MARISHA: Dream things into existence.

3727
02:41:22.325 --> 02:41:25.229
So wait, it said you have to get there

3728
02:41:25.229 --> 02:41:27.663
by a way through the Underdark?

3729
02:41:27.663 --> 02:41:30.155
Or it borders?

3730
02:41:30.155 --> 02:41:32.820
There's a sliver that borders--

3731
02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:35.127
MATT: There is a boundary of it supposedly

3732
02:41:35.127 --> 02:41:37.826
that is bordering the
very subterranean base of the Underdark.

3733
02:41:37.826 --> 02:41:39.800
LIAM: There's a crack 20,000 leagues under the sea

3734
02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:40.909
that touches it.

3735
02:41:40.909 --> 02:41:43.790
MARISHA: Does it give any indication of where that crack is?

3736
02:41:43.790 --> 02:41:44.623
MATT: None.

3737
02:41:49.609 --> 02:41:50.552
TRAVIS: What else are we researching?

3738
02:41:50.552 --> 02:41:51.633
MARISHA: Yeah, what else are we researching?

3739
02:41:51.633 --> 02:41:55.363
LIAM: I would like to ask: any tomes you have

3740
02:41:55.363 --> 02:42:00.363
on individuals trying to make use of

3741
02:42:00.959 --> 02:42:03.729
the demonic or greater things,

3742
02:42:03.729 --> 02:42:07.146
or trying to, I guess in general history,

3743
02:42:08.495 --> 02:42:13.412
intrepid individuals trying to harness greater power?

3744
02:42:15.671 --> 02:42:17.220
MATT: (chuckling)

3745
02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:18.794
The monk who's assigned to you goes,

3746
02:42:18.794 --> 02:42:22.168
"That's many-- that's a lot. That's like,

3747
02:42:22.168 --> 02:42:24.938
"most of the Age of Arcanum.

3748
02:42:24.938 --> 02:42:27.217
"You might want to narrow it a little bit.

3749
02:42:27.217 --> 02:42:29.442
"Be a little a little more specific,
that's a lot of reading."

3750
02:42:29.442 --> 02:42:31.358
LIAM: How about a book that centers

3751
02:42:31.358 --> 02:42:36.358
on the worst people?

3752
02:42:36.851 --> 02:42:40.351
MATT: "The worst people, that's relative."

3753
02:42:41.532 --> 02:42:44.040
LIAM: People who have done the most terrible things,

3754
02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:48.182
who have tried to summon terrible things from beyond.

3755
02:42:48.182 --> 02:42:51.254
Illicit acts.

3756
02:42:51.254 --> 02:42:53.004
Summoning demons.

3757
02:42:54.221 --> 02:42:55.306
MATT: "There's many.

3758
02:42:55.306 --> 02:42:59.473
"I could point you to," make an investigation check.

3759
02:43:00.822 --> 02:43:02.026
LIAM and LAURA: At advantage.

3760
02:43:02.026 --> 02:43:04.522
TRAVIS: The Google search bar: "bad people."

3761
02:43:04.522 --> 02:43:05.818
MARISHA: (laughs)

3762
02:43:05.818 --> 02:43:08.400
LIAM: Who have tried to abuse this stuff.

3763
02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:11.684
LAURA: "Bad people who have abused people."

3764
02:43:11.684 --> 02:43:12.792
LIAM: 27.

3765
02:43:12.792 --> 02:43:14.790
MATT: So many, so many.

3766
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:17.089
History is filled with bad people that have summoned

3767
02:43:17.089 --> 02:43:19.059
creatures and demons and entities all over.

3768
02:43:19.059 --> 02:43:22.391
There are cults all over the world who that done this.

3769
02:43:22.391 --> 02:43:25.563
There are warlocks, and there are mages,

3770
02:43:25.563 --> 02:43:27.750
who all through history, whether it be for good or for evil,

3771
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:31.695
have tried to bind creatures like this to their will,

3772
02:43:31.695 --> 02:43:33.938
some successfully, some not.

3773
02:43:33.938 --> 02:43:36.236
Especially when the Betrayer Gods walked the realm as well,

3774
02:43:36.236 --> 02:43:40.031
there are many cabals that were built to the Betrayer Gods,

3775
02:43:40.031 --> 02:43:43.238
as well as the demon princes of the Abyss.

3776
02:43:43.238 --> 02:43:45.764
It's a dizzying amount of information.

3777
02:43:45.764 --> 02:43:48.793
LIAM: What about people who have served the Crawling King?

3778
02:43:48.793 --> 02:43:50.770
MATT: People who have served the Crawling King?

3779
02:43:50.770 --> 02:43:54.834
Interesting enough, most of those that have been,

3780
02:43:54.834 --> 02:43:56.731
their names are stricken from history

3781
02:43:56.731 --> 02:43:57.986
or haven't been recovered.

3782
02:43:57.986 --> 02:44:00.503
A lot of individuals, aside from

3783
02:44:00.503 --> 02:44:05.003
a handful of definitive mages from the Age of Arcanum,

3784
02:44:06.978 --> 02:44:09.728
they haven't either recovered it.

3785
02:44:11.832 --> 02:44:13.242
I guess what I'm trying to tell you is

3786
02:44:13.242 --> 02:44:15.742
it's still a very broad topic.

3787
02:44:16.968 --> 02:44:18.803
I could sit here and make up shit for 20 minutes

3788
02:44:18.803 --> 02:44:19.831
and tell it at you.

3789
02:44:19.831 --> 02:44:20.798
LIAM: Don't do that. Every time I talk books,

3790
02:44:20.798 --> 02:44:23.659
I do not want you to monologue for--

3791
02:44:23.659 --> 02:44:25.503
TALIESIN: Was hoping to find a Bored Panda link.

3792
02:44:25.503 --> 02:44:27.119
Ten worst-- yeah.
MATT: Right.

3793
02:44:28.336 --> 02:44:31.454
You do not discover anything possibly pertinent

3794
02:44:31.454 --> 02:44:33.028
to the things that you're seeking at the moment,

3795
02:44:33.028 --> 02:44:34.093
I'll put it that way.

3796
02:44:34.093 --> 02:44:37.377
SAM: What about the Abyss?

3797
02:44:37.377 --> 02:44:41.885
What about, didn't we see an image of Bahamut--

3798
02:44:41.885 --> 02:44:43.576
LIAM and SAM: Baphomet?

3799
02:44:43.576 --> 02:44:47.170
MARISHA: Baphomet, and the language was in Abyssal

3800
02:44:47.170 --> 02:44:50.293
that was then scratched out with Celestial overtop of it.

3801
02:44:50.293 --> 02:44:54.394
TRAVIS: I would like to know a bit more
about Baphomet, actually.

3802
02:44:54.394 --> 02:44:55.454
MATT: Sure.

3803
02:44:55.454 --> 02:44:58.073
Go ahead and roll an investigation check.

3804
02:44:58.073 --> 02:45:00.318
TRAVIS: King of Shadows.

3805
02:45:00.318 --> 02:45:02.352
MATT: Okay, so an hour has passed for the two pieces

3806
02:45:02.352 --> 02:45:03.566
of research you guys have done,

3807
02:45:03.566 --> 02:45:06.250
so you'd have to recast, if you want to.

3808
02:45:06.250 --> 02:45:07.083
LAURA: Okay.

3809
02:45:08.658 --> 02:45:13.200
I'll cast it on, who all is researching stuff?

3810
02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:15.366
LIAM: I think you should have me.

3811
02:45:15.366 --> 02:45:17.397
TRAVIS: I'll research Baphomet.

3812
02:45:17.397 --> 02:45:20.684
TALIESIN: I'll do it at level four
and get all three of them.

3813
02:45:20.684 --> 02:45:22.184
LAURA: Oh, okay, great.

3814
02:45:23.218 --> 02:45:24.802
TALIESIN: You all have one more round.

3815
02:45:24.802 --> 02:45:26.325
TRAVIS: Just applied for a library card.

3816
02:45:26.325 --> 02:45:27.887
TALIESIN: (whooshing)

3817
02:45:27.887 --> 02:45:30.512
This is fun, this is new.

3818
02:45:30.512 --> 02:45:31.826
Tap each of you on the head, you've got

3819
02:45:31.826 --> 02:45:34.316
an hour of intelligence advantage.

3820
02:45:34.316 --> 02:45:36.280
MARISHA: Yes, yes.

3821
02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:38.374
LAURA: And now I can Bless you.

3822
02:45:38.374 --> 02:45:40.379
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

3823
02:45:40.379 --> 02:45:42.825
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: That's crazy.

3824
02:45:42.825 --> 02:45:45.764
MATT: So who's researching what?

3825
02:45:45.764 --> 02:45:47.716
You're doing Baphomet, you said?

3826
02:45:47.716 --> 02:45:50.456
Roll an investigation check with advantage.

3827
02:45:50.456 --> 02:45:52.249
LAURA: Guidance.
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

3828
02:45:52.249 --> 02:45:54.219
SAM: It's under B.

3829
02:45:54.219 --> 02:45:55.392
TRAVIS: That's really good.

3830
02:45:55.392 --> 02:45:56.710
And that's a natural 20.

3831
02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:57.651
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

3832
02:45:57.651 --> 02:46:00.764
SAM: Natural 20, plus d4.
TRAVIS: Natural 19 and a natural 20.

3833
02:46:00.764 --> 02:46:02.919
MARISHA: Hey!
LAURA: Add a d4 anyway.

3834
02:46:02.919 --> 02:46:05.941
I want to see where this number ends up at.

3835
02:46:05.941 --> 02:46:06.999
MATT: Okay.

3836
02:46:07.982 --> 02:46:09.672
TRAVIS: Wow, that's 30.

3837
02:46:09.672 --> 02:46:11.225
LAURA: 30!

3838
02:46:11.225 --> 02:46:12.248
MARISHA: Yes!

3839
02:46:12.248 --> 02:46:13.880
LAURA: He rolled a 30.

3840
02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:15.065
MATT: Whew.

3841
02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:19.010
Damn!

3842
02:46:19.010 --> 02:46:22.343
All righty. Let me go pull up some of this information

3843
02:46:22.343 --> 02:46:24.272
that you guys are asking about here, hold on a second.

3844
02:46:24.272 --> 02:46:26.777
SAM: You know more than Matt does about it now.

3845
02:46:26.777 --> 02:46:28.281
MATT: Probably.
LIAM: Start makin' it up.

3846
02:46:28.281 --> 02:46:30.714
TRAVIS: Especially about where we're going next.

3847
02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:34.185
MATT: Hold on a second, I got to find my information here.

3848
02:46:34.185 --> 02:46:35.566
TALIESIN: We have an opportunity to learn about a few things

3849
02:46:35.566 --> 02:46:37.616
we don't know anything about, though.

3850
02:46:37.616 --> 02:46:39.479
MATT: That's true, and you have a lot of things

3851
02:46:39.479 --> 02:46:43.066
that you picked up throughout your adventures

3852
02:46:43.066 --> 02:46:44.744
or things that might pertain to what happened here

3853
02:46:44.744 --> 02:46:46.032
that you can research as well.

3854
02:46:46.032 --> 02:46:47.210
MARISHA: Dodecahedron, yeah.

3855
02:46:47.210 --> 02:46:48.560
SAM: Should we research that?

3856
02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:49.651
MARISHA: We can look it up.

3857
02:46:49.651 --> 02:46:51.023
LIAM: There wouldn't be anything in the history books

3858
02:46:51.023 --> 02:46:54.522
about a temporary or new location of a hidden--

3859
02:46:54.522 --> 02:46:56.456
LAURA: No, but it could maybe--

3860
02:46:56.456 --> 02:46:59.933
MATT: All right, so you do know, Baphomet

3861
02:46:59.933 --> 02:47:01.569
is the demon prince of beasts.

3862
02:47:01.569 --> 02:47:02.597
That's what he's referred to,

3863
02:47:02.597 --> 02:47:07.597
and he's considered the master of minotaurs

3864
02:47:07.843 --> 02:47:11.376
and other demonic bestial creatures.

3865
02:47:12.844 --> 02:47:16.011
He lives on his own plane of the Abyss,

3866
02:47:18.442 --> 02:47:22.220
often rivaling with Yagnu.

3867
02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:24.446
Yagnihu?

3868
02:47:24.446 --> 02:47:26.117
Yeenoghu.

3869
02:47:26.117 --> 02:47:28.493
Pronunciation's fucked up.

3870
02:47:28.493 --> 02:47:29.910
Demon names are great.

3871
02:47:29.910 --> 02:47:31.004
Which you've heard before.

3872
02:47:31.004 --> 02:47:35.153
That was the demonic gnoll lord,

3873
02:47:35.153 --> 02:47:38.993
to where the gnoll cultists that you met

3874
02:47:38.993 --> 02:47:40.804
at Alfield were worshiping.

3875
02:47:40.804 --> 02:47:43.570
LAURA: I knew I recognized that name.

3876
02:47:44.554 --> 02:47:46.960
MATT: Is essentially this patron entity

3877
02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:51.760
to many man-beast creatures that put their worship

3878
02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:55.932
and interest towards more Abyssal powers.

3879
02:47:55.932 --> 02:47:57.112
SAM: It's a god?

3880
02:47:57.112 --> 02:47:58.949
MATT: It's a demon prince, which is not a god.

3881
02:47:58.949 --> 02:48:01.074
TRAVIS: Prince of beasts.

3882
02:48:01.074 --> 02:48:02.491
Also not a devil.

3883
02:48:04.139 --> 02:48:05.747
MARISHA: More Abyssal shit, more Abyssal shit.

3884
02:48:05.747 --> 02:48:07.254
TRAVIS: Not hell.

3885
02:48:07.254 --> 02:48:11.171
SAM: But someone that they could summon, possibly?

3886
02:48:12.089 --> 02:48:15.314
MARISHA: Or that he's working for?

3887
02:48:18.138 --> 02:48:19.127
TRAVIS: What else?

3888
02:48:19.127 --> 02:48:20.492
TALIESIN: I was going to say, you guys still have

3889
02:48:20.492 --> 02:48:23.835
two more research tokens, basically.

3890
02:48:23.835 --> 02:48:25.918
MARISHA: Well, let's research...

3891
02:48:27.482 --> 02:48:28.909
SAM: Luxon? The dodeca?

3892
02:48:28.909 --> 02:48:30.500
TALIESIN: I want Angel of Irons,

3893
02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:31.683
because we just don't know anything.

3894
02:48:31.683 --> 02:48:33.809
MARISHA: Angel of Irons, and then I would like to do

3895
02:48:33.809 --> 02:48:38.022
a geography check on maybe some shit.

3896
02:48:38.022 --> 02:48:38.963
MATT: Okay.

3897
02:48:38.963 --> 02:48:40.603
MARISHA: I mean, do we need a geography check?

3898
02:48:40.603 --> 02:48:41.436
ALL: No.

3899
02:48:41.436 --> 02:48:43.388
MATT: You have many things you can research here.

3900
02:48:43.388 --> 02:48:46.040
LIAM: I'd like to research the origins of the Kryn Empire,

3901
02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.771
their religion and its origin.

3902
02:48:48.771 --> 02:48:50.434
MARISHA: I'll do the Angel of Irons.

3903
02:48:50.434 --> 02:48:51.972
MATT: Okay, make an intelligence check.

3904
02:48:51.972 --> 02:48:53.425
LAURA: Guidance.

3905
02:48:53.425 --> 02:48:55.984
SAM: Bless, Guidance, Guidance, Bless, inspired.

3906
02:48:55.984 --> 02:48:57.734
LAURA: Guidance, Guidance.

3907
02:49:00.012 --> 02:49:01.842
LIAM: 30.
SAM: Whoa!

3908
02:49:01.842 --> 02:49:02.675
MATT: Okay.

3909
02:49:03.521 --> 02:49:05.113
MARISHA: What is this, investigation you said?

3910
02:49:05.113 --> 02:49:06.709
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: Okay.

3911
02:49:06.709 --> 02:49:07.782
22 for me.

3912
02:49:07.782 --> 02:49:09.815
MATT: 22 for you, okay.

3913
02:49:10.789 --> 02:49:13.030
Got it, all right, so.

3914
02:49:14.732 --> 02:49:16.471
From what you can find that's kept here,

3915
02:49:16.471 --> 02:49:20.629
it speaks of the

3916
02:49:20.629 --> 02:49:23.295
beginning of the drow

3917
02:49:23.295 --> 02:49:27.554
and the creation under Lolth, the Spider Queen

3918
02:49:27.554 --> 02:49:30.222
during the later stages of the founding

3919
02:49:30.222 --> 02:49:32.139
and the Age of Arcanum.

3920
02:49:34.167 --> 02:49:38.117
It is thought that the Kryn,

3921
02:49:38.117 --> 02:49:39.675
at some point during

3922
02:49:39.675 --> 02:49:42.689
or at the tail end of the Age of Arcanum,

3923
02:49:42.689 --> 02:49:45.063
at least the den that began this movement

3924
02:49:45.063 --> 02:49:48.453
broke away from Lolth's influence

3925
02:49:48.453 --> 02:49:51.619
and, to some degree, had managed to

3926
02:49:51.619 --> 02:49:56.619
or began to build this religion around some unknown,

3927
02:49:56.891 --> 02:50:01.454
unconfirmed light entity.

3928
02:50:01.454 --> 02:50:05.833
Most of the notes speak of it with dubious interest,

3929
02:50:05.833 --> 02:50:07.676
debating whether or not it's actually a god,

3930
02:50:07.676 --> 02:50:09.966
and fearful that such entities that have

3931
02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:13.799
no historical record could be

3932
02:50:13.799 --> 02:50:18.073
fronts for other entities.

3933
02:50:18.073 --> 02:50:21.631
Or it can just be an excuse to bind people together

3934
02:50:21.631 --> 02:50:23.280
under a single ruler.

3935
02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.344
LIAM: The point of view of the author is one of skepticism

3936
02:50:27.344 --> 02:50:28.517
towards whatever--

3937
02:50:28.517 --> 02:50:33.268
MATT: Most things here are written from a standpoint of

3938
02:50:33.268 --> 02:50:38.108
what information they can grasp with a little bit of

3939
02:50:38.108 --> 02:50:39.733
intellectual footnotes on the side,

3940
02:50:39.733 --> 02:50:41.924
given, you know, some opinions here and there,

3941
02:50:41.924 --> 02:50:43.469
but they're not given as fact.

3942
02:50:43.469 --> 02:50:45.607
The opinions are very much opinions of the author,

3943
02:50:45.607 --> 02:50:48.066
and are noted as such.

3944
02:50:48.066 --> 02:50:52.852
There has been some challenge in finding historical record.

3945
02:50:52.852 --> 02:50:55.453
There has been very little communication

3946
02:50:55.453 --> 02:51:00.247
or very minor collaboration with the Kryn.

3947
02:51:00.247 --> 02:51:02.310
Before this conflict ever happened,

3948
02:51:02.310 --> 02:51:04.058
there have been meetings.

3949
02:51:04.058 --> 02:51:05.943
It isn't like the Empire and the Kryn never met before,

3950
02:51:05.943 --> 02:51:07.371
it's just always been like we stay here,

3951
02:51:07.371 --> 02:51:09.553
you stay here type of thing, and they've had

3952
02:51:09.553 --> 02:51:14.224
attempted conversations, and no peace talks,

3953
02:51:14.224 --> 02:51:16.966
there has been no war before, but there has definitely been

3954
02:51:16.966 --> 02:51:19.981
conflict at the borders, there have been

3955
02:51:19.981 --> 02:51:22.063
discussions and agreements to basically

3956
02:51:22.063 --> 02:51:25.076
keep to their side of things for an extended period of time,

3957
02:51:25.076 --> 02:51:28.870
and some attempts at trading information and goods,

3958
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:32.435
but largely a general mistrust from one side or both

3959
02:51:32.435 --> 02:51:34.573
has prevented those from going too far.

3960
02:51:34.573 --> 02:51:39.355
They appear to be very guarded about their religion

3961
02:51:39.355 --> 02:51:42.270
to those they don't trust, but they do speak of the Luxon,

3962
02:51:42.270 --> 02:51:43.809
they speak of some of the similar ideas

3963
02:51:43.809 --> 02:51:44.868
of what you've been told before

3964
02:51:44.868 --> 02:51:47.272
of this light entity that supposedly existed

3965
02:51:47.272 --> 02:51:50.611
before all gods, and was the one prime entity

3966
02:51:50.611 --> 02:51:55.277
of which all other deities pale by comparison.

3967
02:51:55.277 --> 02:51:57.585
It speaks of

3968
02:51:59.868 --> 02:52:01.858
conversations of dunamancy,

3969
02:52:01.858 --> 02:52:06.286
but only in the sense of people who've witnessed it,

3970
02:52:06.286 --> 02:52:09.442
people who have seen the power that it has,

3971
02:52:09.442 --> 02:52:12.281
and there are newer notes based on recent battles

3972
02:52:12.281 --> 02:52:14.336
that have happened in fresher ink,

3973
02:52:14.336 --> 02:52:16.277
and notes placed in some of the latter pages

3974
02:52:16.277 --> 02:52:19.878
that speak on more examples of the terrifying power

3975
02:52:19.878 --> 02:52:23.387
that holds, the manipulation of gravity,

3976
02:52:23.387 --> 02:52:26.671
of space, being able to fracture realities,

3977
02:52:26.671 --> 02:52:31.588
and people talking about manipulation of time and momentum.

3978
02:52:32.930 --> 02:52:35.133
As far as the religion goes, you don't learn

3979
02:52:35.133 --> 02:52:37.802
that much more than what you already know.

3980
02:52:37.802 --> 02:52:39.714
You probably have a pretty decent firsthand account,

3981
02:52:39.714 --> 02:52:41.973
based on the experience you had there,

3982
02:52:41.973 --> 02:52:44.108
and the fact that a lot of information

3983
02:52:44.108 --> 02:52:46.880
is still being carefully guarded from within the Dynasty.

3984
02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:48.899
LIAM: Okay. Good, thank you.

3985
02:52:48.899 --> 02:52:50.294
MATT: You.

3986
02:52:50.294 --> 02:52:51.516
Angel of Irons.

3987
02:52:51.516 --> 02:52:54.715
There are some notes in here.

3988
02:52:54.715 --> 02:52:56.567
MARISHA: Ooh!

3989
02:52:56.567 --> 02:52:59.114
Notes?
MATT: Speaking about the Angel of Irons,

3990
02:52:59.114 --> 02:53:02.491
in one book you find that speaks of cults,

3991
02:53:02.491 --> 02:53:07.491
and specifically cults and strange fringe worship.

3992
02:53:07.706 --> 02:53:10.252
Speaks of the Angel of Irons as a relatively new obsession

3993
02:53:10.252 --> 02:53:13.918
of a sparse cult not more than 40 years old.

3994
02:53:13.918 --> 02:53:16.035
MARISHA: Oh, shit, okay.

3995
02:53:16.035 --> 02:53:17.956
MATT: Very little is known, as even worshipers

3996
02:53:17.956 --> 02:53:20.512
are kept in the dark about their patron.

3997
02:53:20.512 --> 02:53:22.209
What is known is that it is something

3998
02:53:22.209 --> 02:53:24.596
of celestial iconography, an imagery mingled

3999
02:53:24.596 --> 02:53:28.598
with twisted chains, known to have come to its followers

4000
02:53:28.598 --> 02:53:31.388
in visions, speaking of being bound in shadow

4001
02:53:31.388 --> 02:53:34.221
and seeking followers to,

4002
02:53:34.221 --> 02:53:35.799
and the one quote that's given here is,

4003
02:53:35.799 --> 02:53:38.905
"release the fanes that hold its shackles."

4004
02:53:38.905 --> 02:53:39.870
SAM: Release the what?

4005
02:53:39.870 --> 02:53:43.077
MATT: "Release the fanes that hold its shackles."

4006
02:53:43.077 --> 02:53:44.979
MARISHA: What are fanes, yeah.

4007
02:53:44.979 --> 02:53:47.437
MATT: A fane is a place of power,

4008
02:53:47.437 --> 02:53:50.478
a location of importance

4009
02:53:50.478 --> 02:53:55.478
and considered of natural ability and power.

4010
02:53:55.918 --> 02:53:57.859
TRAVIS: Like a leyline?

4011
02:53:57.859 --> 02:54:00.150
MATT: To a degree.
MARISHA: Or like a person, like a being?

4012
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:02.508
MATT: It can be interpreted in different ways.

4013
02:54:02.508 --> 02:54:03.875
MARISHA: Okay.

4014
02:54:03.875 --> 02:54:05.585
LIAM: Source of power.

4015
02:54:05.585 --> 02:54:07.105
MATT: While not part of this book,

4016
02:54:07.105 --> 02:54:09.380
things you begin to pick up in other elements there,

4017
02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:12.951
the chain motif catches your mind.

4018
02:54:12.951 --> 02:54:15.234
Whether related or not, the chain motif

4019
02:54:15.234 --> 02:54:18.872
is also commonly threaded through another entity,

4020
02:54:18.872 --> 02:54:22.164
one of the Betrayer Gods known as the Chained Oblivion,

4021
02:54:22.164 --> 02:54:25.445
which is the mad god Tharizdun.

4022
02:54:25.445 --> 02:54:27.342
MARISHA: We heard about that before, right?

4023
02:54:27.342 --> 02:54:29.425
TRAVIS: Yes we did, yeah. He a big one.

4024
02:54:29.425 --> 02:54:32.900
MATT: Described as darkness unending, a malevolent entity

4025
02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:35.704
unlike any of the other Betrayer Gods,

4026
02:54:35.704 --> 02:54:39.150
whose terrible dreams bring the endless-- Tharizdun--

4027
02:54:39.150 --> 02:54:40.696
whose terrible dreams bring the endless depths

4028
02:54:40.696 --> 02:54:42.554
of the Abyss into being.

4029
02:54:42.554 --> 02:54:43.502
LAURA: Ooh.

4030
02:54:43.502 --> 02:54:44.459
MATT: Ioun actually led the charge

4031
02:54:44.459 --> 02:54:47.821
against this entity's reemergence long ago,

4032
02:54:47.821 --> 02:54:51.007
her success leaving her greatly wounded,

4033
02:54:51.007 --> 02:54:52.239
and a wound that will never heal.

4034
02:54:52.239 --> 02:54:54.364
LAURA: Oh, fuck.
MARISHA: Right.

4035
02:54:56.692 --> 02:54:59.561
SAM: We got some secret cult members out there

4036
02:54:59.561 --> 02:55:02.403
who are trying to bring all these--

4037
02:55:02.403 --> 02:55:05.196
TRAVIS: The library of their arch--

4038
02:55:05.196 --> 02:55:07.069
MARISHA: Of their arch-nemesis, yeah,

4039
02:55:07.069 --> 02:55:11.141
because Ioun is the official god of the Cobalt Soul.

4040
02:55:11.141 --> 02:55:12.226
LAURA: Right.

4041
02:55:12.226 --> 02:55:13.567
TRAVIS: Tharizdun, huh?

4042
02:55:13.567 --> 02:55:15.009
MARISHA: Tharizdun.

4043
02:55:15.009 --> 02:55:16.050
LIAM: There's lots of dunes.

4044
02:55:16.050 --> 02:55:20.117
TRAVIS: Can we pick up some
anti-Tharizdun potions at Pumat's?

4045
02:55:20.117 --> 02:55:21.538
MATT: Are there any other things you want to research:

4046
02:55:21.538 --> 02:55:23.918
people, places, anything?

4047
02:55:23.918 --> 02:55:25.211
SAM: While they were doing all this,

4048
02:55:25.211 --> 02:55:27.642
can I have looked up just general knowledge

4049
02:55:27.642 --> 02:55:31.083
about magic dealing with

4050
02:55:31.083 --> 02:55:34.791
rebirth or reincarnation

4051
02:55:34.791 --> 02:55:36.678
or resurrection sort of magic?

4052
02:55:36.678 --> 02:55:38.105
MATT: Sure, make an intelligence check,

4053
02:55:38.105 --> 02:55:40.858
or an investigation check.

4054
02:55:40.858 --> 02:55:42.691
SAM: Natural one.
MARISHA: Oh no.

4055
02:55:43.683 --> 02:55:46.040
SAM: But with Guidance, it's a four.

4056
02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:47.256
(laughter)

4057
02:55:47.256 --> 02:55:49.047
MATT: You feel a bit lost in this library.

4058
02:55:49.047 --> 02:55:52.038
You weren't a huge reader of tomes, you know.

4059
02:55:52.038 --> 02:55:53.637
Books and things that came to you in Felderwin

4060
02:55:53.637 --> 02:55:56.950
was generally a little more common,

4061
02:55:56.950 --> 02:56:01.811
but these are archaic and read in very archaic ways,

4062
02:56:01.811 --> 02:56:03.787
and you find yourself unable to really find anything

4063
02:56:03.787 --> 02:56:05.824
that catches your interest, unfortunately.

4064
02:56:05.824 --> 02:56:10.751
LAURA: I'm going to look up anything about the Traveler.

4065
02:56:10.751 --> 02:56:11.584
MATT: Sure.

4066
02:56:12.572 --> 02:56:14.192
Roll an investigation check.

4067
02:56:14.192 --> 02:56:16.341
SAM: There's nothing about him because he's not real.

4068
02:56:16.341 --> 02:56:17.750
LAURA: Guidance.

4069
02:56:20.167 --> 02:56:21.884
Natural one!
SAM: Wow!

4070
02:56:21.884 --> 02:56:24.746
(laughter)

4071
02:56:24.746 --> 02:56:26.847
SAM: This whole time, I'm reading a book about the Traveler

4072
02:56:26.847 --> 02:56:30.028
and she's reading a book about reincarnation.

4073
02:56:30.028 --> 02:56:31.573
MATT: You're just going, "Shit!"

4074
02:56:31.573 --> 02:56:34.116
SAM: Not right, oh well.

4075
02:56:34.116 --> 02:56:35.473
LAURA: I just can't find shit, huh?

4076
02:56:35.473 --> 02:56:37.227
MATT: Unfortunately, you can't find any books

4077
02:56:37.227 --> 02:56:38.493
that seem to mention him.
LAURA: That's fine.

4078
02:56:38.493 --> 02:56:40.626
You know what I'm going to do?

4079
02:56:40.626 --> 02:56:42.316
TRAVIS: What?

4080
02:56:42.316 --> 02:56:44.961
LAURA: I'm going to draw some dicks.

4081
02:56:44.961 --> 02:56:48.300
And I'm going to write, "Have you ever noticed

4082
02:56:48.300 --> 02:56:51.820
"how old books make you have to poop?"

4083
02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:54.414
In the bottom of one of the books,

4084
02:56:54.414 --> 02:56:56.828
and then in another one I'm going to put

4085
02:56:56.828 --> 02:56:59.854
Captain Tusktooth, and then in another one

4086
02:56:59.854 --> 02:57:02.113
I'm going to draw the fucking Traveler.

4087
02:57:02.113 --> 02:57:05.243
MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check.

4088
02:57:05.243 --> 02:57:07.537
SAM: Being in libraries?

4089
02:57:07.537 --> 02:57:09.564
LAURA: Being in libraries.
SAM: Yeah, definitely.

4090
02:57:09.564 --> 02:57:10.707
LAURA: They make you have to poop.

4091
02:57:10.707 --> 02:57:11.720
SAM: Oh yeah, for sure.

4092
02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:14.751
If you're in the stacks studying, you got to take a dump.

4093
02:57:14.751 --> 02:57:19.706
LAURA: Dude, there's like a condition that if

4094
02:57:19.706 --> 02:57:22.837
you are at Barnes &amp; Noble or something--

4095
02:57:22.837 --> 02:57:24.094
SAM: Barnes &amp; Noble bowel.

4096
02:57:24.094 --> 02:57:28.570
LAURA: People have to poop a lot at book stores.

4097
02:57:28.570 --> 02:57:29.828
TRAVIS: What?

4098
02:57:29.828 --> 02:57:31.624
LAURA: Guidance, oh, I didn't guide myself.

4099
02:57:31.624 --> 02:57:32.758
TALIESIN: That was a whole--

4100
02:57:32.758 --> 02:57:34.172
LAURA: That's okay, it's a 20.

4101
02:57:34.172 --> 02:57:35.005
MATT: 20?

4102
02:57:35.005 --> 02:57:36.650
TALIESIN: That was a long walk.
MATT: Okay.

4103
02:57:36.650 --> 02:57:40.181
This was looking up, sorry, remind me again, it was--

4104
02:57:40.181 --> 02:57:41.182
TALIESIN: This was drawing dicks.

4105
02:57:41.182 --> 02:57:42.333
MATT: Drawing dicks, got you.

4106
02:57:42.333 --> 02:57:43.327
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Thank you.

4107
02:57:43.327 --> 02:57:45.573
My brain is in four different places.

4108
02:57:46.507 --> 02:57:49.198
Though you are under watch, though there is

4109
02:57:49.198 --> 02:57:51.611
a member of the Archive watching you carefully,

4110
02:57:51.611 --> 02:57:56.468
you deftly cough and cause another book

4111
02:57:56.468 --> 02:57:59.336
to fall off the table nearby and catch their attention.

4112
02:57:59.336 --> 02:58:00.231
While they go to pick it up again,

4113
02:58:00.231 --> 02:58:02.415
you quickly doodle on the side there,

4114
02:58:02.415 --> 02:58:04.911
close it over, set it aside, no one seems to notice.

4115
02:58:04.911 --> 02:58:05.961
LAURA: Sweet.

4116
02:58:07.204 --> 02:58:09.562
TRAVIS: We've exercised everything here, yes?

4117
02:58:09.562 --> 02:58:11.670
LAURA: Should we ask, I don't know,

4118
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:13.478
should we ask about like,

4119
02:58:13.478 --> 02:58:18.021
what I heard Obann say, that he read out loud?

4120
02:58:18.021 --> 02:58:18.854
SAM: What did he say?

4121
02:58:18.854 --> 02:58:21.475
LAURA: I can't remember.
SAM: Oh, the poem thing?

4122
02:58:21.475 --> 02:58:25.320
"Let lie the King's instrument," that sort of stuff?

4123
02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:27.218
LAURA: The thing that he said out loud?

4124
02:58:27.218 --> 02:58:28.148
MATT: From the--

4125
02:58:28.148 --> 02:58:30.121
MARISHA: His whole like ritual that he did?

4126
02:58:30.121 --> 02:58:31.472
LAURA: Reading something out loud?

4127
02:58:31.472 --> 02:58:33.048
MARISHA: When he did the ritual or when you were scrying?

4128
02:58:33.048 --> 02:58:34.574
MATT: The ritual or the scry from yesterday?

4129
02:58:34.574 --> 02:58:35.948
LAURA: From the scry, when he was

4130
02:58:35.948 --> 02:58:38.082
reading a book or something

4131
02:58:38.082 --> 02:58:39.673
when I scryed on him.
MATT: Right.

4132
02:58:39.673 --> 02:58:41.972
Let me go ahead and pull that up real fast.

4133
02:58:41.972 --> 02:58:43.154
None of you guys wrote it down,

4134
02:58:43.154 --> 02:58:43.987
I can go ahead and find that.

4135
02:58:43.987 --> 02:58:46.235
LAURA: I feel like I--
SAM: Of course we wrote it down.

4136
02:58:46.235 --> 02:58:48.468
LAURA: Yeah, of course we wrote it down.

4137
02:58:48.468 --> 02:58:50.635
But it was just very fast.

4138
02:58:51.568 --> 02:58:54.004
MATT: That's all good, I got it right here.

4139
02:58:54.004 --> 02:58:56.667
SAM: He said Kamordah, geysers.

4140
02:58:56.667 --> 02:58:57.585
That's what I wrote down.

4141
02:58:57.585 --> 02:58:59.752
MATT: Nope, that's not it.

4142
02:59:02.653 --> 02:59:03.736
MATT: Here we go.

4143
02:59:05.277 --> 02:59:08.816
He said, "Jourrael's remains were bisected.

4144
02:59:08.816 --> 02:59:10.928
"The heart buried within the Lotusden

4145
02:59:10.928 --> 02:59:14.038
"and the skull entrusted to the elves within the Veluthil."

4146
02:59:14.038 --> 02:59:15.273
LAURA: Yeah, see, that seems important.

4147
02:59:15.273 --> 02:59:16.589
MARISHA: That seems very important.

4148
02:59:16.589 --> 02:59:17.542
MATT: "It seems that we have questions to ask,

4149
02:59:17.542 --> 02:59:18.486
"my dear Orphan Maker.

4150
02:59:18.486 --> 02:59:21.403
"Come, Hand, let us find you a new friend."

4151
02:59:21.403 --> 02:59:25.667
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to repeat that to the people there

4152
02:59:25.667 --> 02:59:28.068
and see if that maybe makes sense to them.

4153
02:59:28.068 --> 02:59:29.734
MATT: Would you like to research it, then?

4154
02:59:29.734 --> 02:59:30.900
Who would like to helm this?

4155
02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:33.464
MARISHA: The gilded lily thing, that's not what it was.

4156
02:59:33.464 --> 02:59:36.256
TALIESIN: You don't want me doing that.

4157
02:59:36.256 --> 02:59:37.908
LAURA: Should I cast Enhance Ability?

4158
02:59:37.908 --> 02:59:39.937
TRAVIS: My investigation's plus six, so somebody--

4159
02:59:39.937 --> 02:59:42.482
SAM: I'll do it.
LAURA: I'm going to cast--

4160
02:59:42.482 --> 02:59:44.362
SAM: Wait, I'm just trying to find a book?

4161
02:59:44.362 --> 02:59:45.245
LAURA: No.

4162
02:59:45.245 --> 02:59:47.592
TRAVIS: You should look up those locations.

4163
02:59:47.592 --> 02:59:49.942
LAURA: I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on Caleb

4164
02:59:49.942 --> 02:59:51.478
and he should look it up.

4165
02:59:51.478 --> 02:59:53.286
MATT: Okay, what you looking up?
LIAM: Jourrael.

4166
02:59:53.286 --> 02:59:54.634
MATT: Okay, Jourrael, all right.

4167
02:59:54.634 --> 02:59:56.765
LAURA: I'm going to cast it at, what, 4th-level

4168
02:59:56.765 --> 02:59:58.635
so you all get bonus again.

4169
02:59:58.635 --> 03:00:00.263
TRAVIS: Cool.
TALIESIN: And then Guidance.

4170
03:00:00.263 --> 03:00:02.372
MATT: You guys can all research a bunch of shit.

4171
03:00:02.372 --> 03:00:05.279
MARISHA: What was the other location that was in there?

4172
03:00:05.279 --> 03:00:07.389
MATT: Velithul.

4173
03:00:07.389 --> 03:00:09.877
MARISHA: Oh, that's the elf shit, right?

4174
03:00:09.877 --> 03:00:12.361
MATT: Veluthil, sorry, Veluthil.

4175
03:00:12.361 --> 03:00:14.409
TRAVIS: 27 on the Lotusden.

4176
03:00:14.409 --> 03:00:15.242
MATT: 27?

4177
03:00:15.242 --> 03:00:16.075
LAURA: Are you guys giving yourself Guidance?

4178
03:00:16.075 --> 03:00:16.976
Guidance, Guidance.

4179
03:00:16.976 --> 03:00:18.206
LIAM: Yes, 27 on Jourrael.

4180
03:00:18.206 --> 03:00:19.039
MATT: What's that?

4181
03:00:19.039 --> 03:00:21.243
LIAM: 27 also on Jourrael.
MATT: Okay.

4182
03:00:21.243 --> 03:00:25.360
Lotusden is a location to the south of Xhorhas.

4183
03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:26.496
TRAVIS: Okay.

4184
03:00:26.496 --> 03:00:27.967
LAURA: Is it swampy?

4185
03:00:27.967 --> 03:00:29.438
MATT: It's a greenwood.

4186
03:00:29.438 --> 03:00:32.688
It is surrounded by somewhat swampland.

4187
03:00:34.589 --> 03:00:36.812
It is a darkened wood that is uncharacteristic

4188
03:00:36.812 --> 03:00:40.800
of a lot of the more parched regions of northern Xhorhas.

4189
03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:42.834
Some folks do apparently live in there.

4190
03:00:42.834 --> 03:00:47.760
There is a culture of folks in what's called Charis.

4191
03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:50.554
A more natural city.

4192
03:00:50.554 --> 03:00:53.120
It seems to be more druidic in nature.

4193
03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:55.284
Often split between the Lotusden halflings,

4194
03:00:55.284 --> 03:01:00.264
which call the region home, and recent dragonborn

4195
03:01:00.264 --> 03:01:02.053
that escaped the destruction of Draconia,

4196
03:01:02.053 --> 03:01:04.904
that have also made it home as well.

4197
03:01:04.904 --> 03:01:06.120
TRAVIS: Lotusden Greenwood.

4198
03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:07.894
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4199
03:01:07.894 --> 03:01:09.191
LAURA: Right.

4200
03:01:09.191 --> 03:01:12.370
MATT: The woods are dark, they are dense,

4201
03:01:12.370 --> 03:01:17.370
and it has many many myths and tales

4202
03:01:17.494 --> 03:01:19.128
that speak of regions of it that are cursed,

4203
03:01:19.128 --> 03:01:22.828
where the woods themselves move without notice and shift,

4204
03:01:22.828 --> 03:01:26.445
as well as other dangers and creatures that call it home.

4205
03:01:26.445 --> 03:01:29.545
TRAVIS: There's some big-ass runes
on the Lotusden Greenwood.

4206
03:01:29.545 --> 03:01:32.110
I know we translated before, I'm just pointing it out.

4207
03:01:32.110 --> 03:01:33.777
MARISHA: I know.

4208
03:01:33.777 --> 03:01:35.833
That's written down somewhere.

4209
03:01:35.833 --> 03:01:37.433
We translated those runes.

4210
03:01:37.433 --> 03:01:39.119
MATT: You were researching Jourrael.

4211
03:01:39.119 --> 03:01:39.952
LIAM: Yeah.

4212
03:01:39.952 --> 03:01:41.833
MATT: All right.

4213
03:01:41.833 --> 03:01:43.108
Jourrael.

4214
03:01:43.108 --> 03:01:43.996
SAM: Jourrael.

4215
03:01:43.996 --> 03:01:48.212
MATT: The name, J-O-U-R-R-A-E-L.

4216
03:01:48.212 --> 03:01:50.882
Referred to as the Caedogeist.

4217
03:01:50.882 --> 03:01:55.455
C-A-E-D-O-G-E-I-S-T.

4218
03:01:55.455 --> 03:01:56.549
LIAM: Caedogeist.

4219
03:01:56.549 --> 03:01:58.026
MATT: The Caedogeist.

4220
03:01:58.026 --> 03:02:03.026
Jourrael was a chosen assassin of Lolth, the Spider Queen.

4221
03:02:03.423 --> 03:02:06.721
Exalted through an arrangement with Asmodeus

4222
03:02:06.721 --> 03:02:08.947
during a brief era of unified interest.

4223
03:02:08.947 --> 03:02:09.780
LIAM: Jesus.

4224
03:02:11.362 --> 03:02:13.862
I cry out loud in the library.

4225
03:02:14.906 --> 03:02:16.723
MATT: Jourrael was a nightmarish specter

4226
03:02:16.723 --> 03:02:20.444
who walked through wall and mountain like water.

4227
03:02:20.444 --> 03:02:24.218
Known colloquially as the Inevitable End.

4228
03:02:24.218 --> 03:02:25.917
Jourrael could not be completely destroyed

4229
03:02:25.917 --> 03:02:27.955
unless the contract of the agreement

4230
03:02:27.955 --> 03:02:30.845
between Lolth and Asmodeus was destroyed.

4231
03:02:30.845 --> 03:02:32.669
In the bloodshed at the end of the Calamity,

4232
03:02:32.669 --> 03:02:34.707
attempts to suss out this answer failed,

4233
03:02:34.707 --> 03:02:36.307
so the body of Jourrael was sundered

4234
03:02:36.307 --> 03:02:37.983
and sealed apart in secret.

4235
03:02:37.983 --> 03:02:39.866
LAURA: (gasps) They're waking up that person, too.

4236
03:02:39.866 --> 03:02:41.196
TALIESIN: Ooh.

4237
03:02:41.196 --> 03:02:42.890
TRAVIS: Oh shit, y'all.

4238
03:02:42.890 --> 03:02:44.796
LIAM: They're waking up the horsemen of the apocalypse.

4239
03:02:44.796 --> 03:02:46.424
TRAVIS: Oh fuck!

4240
03:02:46.424 --> 03:02:49.903
MARISHA: Right, and Jourrael, he said his body was bisected

4241
03:02:49.903 --> 03:02:52.524
and put under two different places, is that what we're--

4242
03:02:52.524 --> 03:02:56.281
MATT: That seems to be what Obann was referring to.

4243
03:02:56.281 --> 03:02:57.551
SAM: Two places?

4244
03:02:57.551 --> 03:02:59.386
MARISHA: Yeah, he said his body was bisected.

4245
03:02:59.386 --> 03:03:01.379
LAURA: One of them is in the Lotusden.

4246
03:03:01.379 --> 03:03:03.821
MARISHA: And the other is in Veluthil?

4247
03:03:03.821 --> 03:03:08.821
SAM: Oh wait, Caduceus, aren't you guarding the body,

4248
03:03:09.059 --> 03:03:11.724
aren't your family guarding the dead body

4249
03:03:11.724 --> 03:03:14.629
of a fallen warrior or something?

4250
03:03:14.629 --> 03:03:16.974
TALIESIN: I mean, technically, but it was trisected,

4251
03:03:16.974 --> 03:03:18.820
not bisected.

4252
03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:22.051
SAM: So it was definitely not the same, it's just--

4253
03:03:22.051 --> 03:03:24.070
TALIESIN: I would find that very--

4254
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:25.742
MATT: This is very different.
TALIESIN: Unlikely.

4255
03:03:25.742 --> 03:03:29.709
TRAVIS: Big difference between three body parts and two.

4256
03:03:29.709 --> 03:03:30.747
SAM: It's an ancient warrior--

4257
03:03:30.747 --> 03:03:34.145
MATT: Also, a Lolthian assassin terror

4258
03:03:34.145 --> 03:03:37.935
versus the holy warrior that was given rest

4259
03:03:37.935 --> 03:03:39.308
under the Raven Queen.

4260
03:03:39.308 --> 03:03:41.843
TALIESIN: Died during the, yeah.

4261
03:03:41.843 --> 03:03:43.402
LAURA: Oh god.

4262
03:03:43.402 --> 03:03:44.335
TALIESIN: Whole 'nother thing.

4263
03:03:44.335 --> 03:03:45.217
LAURA: Wait.

4264
03:03:45.217 --> 03:03:48.905
Does that mean they've already got both parts of it, then?

4265
03:03:48.905 --> 03:03:51.825
SAM: What was the quote again?

4266
03:03:51.825 --> 03:03:53.319
LAURA: God, I don't know.

4267
03:03:53.319 --> 03:03:55.383
MATT: The quote was "Jourrael's remains were bisected.

4268
03:03:55.383 --> 03:03:57.107
"The heart buried within the Lotusden,

4269
03:03:57.107 --> 03:04:00.174
"and the skull entrusted to the elves in the Veluthil."

4270
03:04:00.174 --> 03:04:02.358
MARISHA: The elves in the Veluthil.

4271
03:04:02.358 --> 03:04:04.049
MATT: And you're researching Veluthil, correct?

4272
03:04:04.049 --> 03:04:04.882
MARISHA: Yes.

4273
03:04:04.882 --> 03:04:06.029
MATT: What was your roll on it?

4274
03:04:06.029 --> 03:04:06.862
MARISHA: 22.

4275
03:04:06.862 --> 03:04:07.881
LIAM: Get it girl, get it, get it girl.

4276
03:04:07.881 --> 03:04:08.831
MATT: Veluthil.

4277
03:04:08.831 --> 03:04:11.444
MARISHA: Right, no no no, sorry, that was an old roll.

4278
03:04:11.444 --> 03:04:12.285
It was a 15.

4279
03:04:12.285 --> 03:04:13.268
MATT: 15, okay.

4280
03:04:13.268 --> 03:04:15.188
Veluthil, not difficult to find.

4281
03:04:15.188 --> 03:04:18.342
It was the historical name of what is now known

4282
03:04:18.342 --> 03:04:19.812
as the Savalirwood.

4283
03:04:19.812 --> 03:04:21.682
LAURA: Oh, right, we already knew that.

4284
03:04:21.682 --> 03:04:22.890
MATT: Yes.

4285
03:04:22.890 --> 03:04:27.117
It was the name of the forest before the corruption

4286
03:04:27.117 --> 03:04:28.987
of Molaesmyr and the entire forest itself

4287
03:04:28.987 --> 03:04:31.643
was rendered under perpetual darkness

4288
03:04:31.643 --> 03:04:35.060
and rolling disaster, yes.
MARISHA: Right.

4289
03:04:37.535 --> 03:04:40.026
TALIESIN: Somewhere there, there was an ancient

4290
03:04:40.026 --> 03:04:43.483
city of elves that have this artifact.

4291
03:04:43.483 --> 03:04:44.883
MARISHA: Are the elves still there?

4292
03:04:44.883 --> 03:04:46.251
They are, right?

4293
03:04:46.251 --> 03:04:50.270
MATT: No, it is a ruin, and the city is still considered--

4294
03:04:50.270 --> 03:04:52.966
it's like Chernobyl, like after ground zero,

4295
03:04:52.966 --> 03:04:55.521
but still not habitable at all.

4296
03:04:55.521 --> 03:04:58.113
Currently, what you do know about it is

4297
03:04:58.113 --> 03:05:02.401
some Uthodurnian interests do go in and out of the ruins.

4298
03:05:02.401 --> 03:05:04.735
In fact, Reani had done some expeditions there.

4299
03:05:04.735 --> 03:05:05.568
MARISHA: Right!

4300
03:05:05.568 --> 03:05:10.422
MATT: Also, Shadycreek Run has a lot of interest there,

4301
03:05:10.422 --> 03:05:12.106
the Trebain family specifically.

4302
03:05:12.106 --> 03:05:13.031
LAURA: Oh god!

4303
03:05:13.031 --> 03:05:14.847
MARISHA: What has interest there?

4304
03:05:14.847 --> 03:05:17.698
MATT: Some of the families in Shadycreek Run.

4305
03:05:17.698 --> 03:05:19.133
The Trebain family specifically,

4306
03:05:19.133 --> 03:05:20.504
as they're focused on antiquities

4307
03:05:20.504 --> 03:05:23.559
and trying to smuggle things out of there.

4308
03:05:23.559 --> 03:05:27.463
And to a smaller degree, the Jagentoths on occasion.

4309
03:05:27.463 --> 03:05:29.032
The Trebain family specifically,

4310
03:05:29.032 --> 03:05:33.023
their main business lies in

4311
03:05:33.023 --> 03:05:35.328
trying to get in there

4312
03:05:35.328 --> 03:05:37.240
and smuggle as many goods out as they can

4313
03:05:37.240 --> 03:05:40.576
from the ruins, and sell them, generally southward.

4314
03:05:40.576 --> 03:05:42.455
(chuckles)

4315
03:05:42.455 --> 03:05:45.173
To whatever private interests have the coin.

4316
03:05:45.173 --> 03:05:48.291
MARISHA: It's in the Savalirwood, so it's still dark,

4317
03:05:48.291 --> 03:05:49.480
it's still fucked up.

4318
03:05:49.480 --> 03:05:50.313
MATT: Oh yeah.

4319
03:05:50.313 --> 03:05:51.795
MARISHA: Okay.

4320
03:05:51.795 --> 03:05:53.579
MATT: And you know this from how long you've lived

4321
03:05:53.579 --> 03:05:54.924
in the Blooming Grove.
TALIESIN: Sure.

4322
03:05:54.924 --> 03:05:58.389
MATT: Even just 10 miles northward of where you grew up

4323
03:05:58.389 --> 03:06:02.068
is what's considered a no man's land by how you were raised.

4324
03:06:02.068 --> 03:06:05.296
It is considered far too dangerous to venture towards.

4325
03:06:05.296 --> 03:06:09.296
SAM: So Jourrael's heart is at the Lotusden,

4326
03:06:10.503 --> 03:06:13.662
and the head is at Veluthil.

4327
03:06:13.662 --> 03:06:14.903
MARISHA: Yeah.

4328
03:06:14.903 --> 03:06:18.142
So he's already gotten the heart?

4329
03:06:18.142 --> 03:06:20.200
TRAVIS: We don't know that.
LAURA: Probably.

4330
03:06:20.200 --> 03:06:21.646
TALIESIN: Looking for the heart, close enough.

4331
03:06:21.646 --> 03:06:23.654
MARISHA: Last time we checked he was at the swampland.

4332
03:06:23.654 --> 03:06:26.912
LAURA: But who knows? They might have already gone to

4333
03:06:26.912 --> 03:06:29.845
the wood. It had been a couple days.

4334
03:06:29.845 --> 03:06:31.188
TALIESIN: It's a pretty big place.

4335
03:06:31.188 --> 03:06:33.738
LAURA: I'm going to scry on them right now.

4336
03:06:33.738 --> 03:06:34.579
MATT: On?

4337
03:06:34.579 --> 03:06:36.295
LAURA: Yasha.
MATT: Yasha, okay.

4338
03:06:36.295 --> 03:06:37.629
TALIESIN: Tink.
LAURA: Thank you.

4339
03:06:37.629 --> 03:06:39.390
Are you enhancing my ability?

4340
03:06:39.390 --> 03:06:41.540
TALIESIN: Well, you can't do it--

4341
03:06:41.540 --> 03:06:43.453
no, I'm giving you Guidance.

4342
03:06:43.453 --> 03:06:46.366
LAURA: If you enhance my ability, I've got perception check.

4343
03:06:46.366 --> 03:06:50.278
TALIESIN: All right, that's fair then, I'll burn another.

4344
03:06:50.278 --> 03:06:52.003
LAURA: 2nd-level?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4345
03:06:52.003 --> 03:06:53.228
LAURA: Okay.

4346
03:06:53.228 --> 03:06:55.482
TRAVIS: Pick one of the good d20s.

4347
03:06:55.482 --> 03:06:56.737
LAURA: Shut up.
SAM: There are none.

4348
03:06:56.737 --> 03:06:58.119
TALIESIN: There's none left. Here.

4349
03:06:58.119 --> 03:06:59.640
TRAVIS: That can't be possible with her.

4350
03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:03.366
LAURA: No, no, no, I'm having faith in mine.

4351
03:07:03.366 --> 03:07:08.366
MATT: All right, you focus here
in the center of the Archive,

4352
03:07:08.399 --> 03:07:09.916
closing your eyes.
LAURA: Just drop down on my knees

4353
03:07:09.916 --> 03:07:11.541
in the middle of the library.

4354
03:07:13.381 --> 03:07:16.353
MATT: A light breeze begins to blow through the space,

4355
03:07:16.353 --> 03:07:19.640
though the windows are closed.

4356
03:07:19.640 --> 03:07:21.926
You too pick up this.

4357
03:07:21.926 --> 03:07:22.926
Interesting.

4358
03:07:24.373 --> 03:07:28.041
Familiar signs, depending on who is toying

4359
03:07:28.041 --> 03:07:31.206
with somebody's current interest and focus.

4360
03:07:31.206 --> 03:07:36.003
You sense the presence of the Traveler come to you and say,

4361
03:07:36.003 --> 03:07:37.753
"Don't mind the books.

4362
03:07:39.472 --> 03:07:43.923
"They'll write your name in time, alongside mine.

4363
03:07:43.923 --> 03:07:47.481
"For now, let's look elsewhere."

4364
03:07:47.481 --> 03:07:50.488
Clasps his arms on your shoulder, and you feel

4365
03:07:50.488 --> 03:07:54.457
your vision drift and push once more

4366
03:07:54.457 --> 03:07:57.082
out through cloud and sky,

4367
03:07:57.082 --> 03:08:00.823
suddenly hitting dense foliage,

4368
03:08:00.823 --> 03:08:03.567
heavy vines, thick root and tree,

4369
03:08:04.689 --> 03:08:08.930
soft overgrown forest floor, where

4370
03:08:08.930 --> 03:08:11.588
fallen elements of plant life

4371
03:08:11.588 --> 03:08:15.308
seems to rot and gather into soft underbrush.

4372
03:08:16.188 --> 03:08:20.555
There you see, pushing through, Yasha,

4373
03:08:20.555 --> 03:08:23.980
cutting branches as they get in the way.

4374
03:08:23.980 --> 03:08:26.531
Obann, cloak and hood down, Laughing Hand

4375
03:08:26.531 --> 03:08:30.035
taking out full trees at the side

4376
03:08:30.035 --> 03:08:32.806
as they (creaking) begin to tumble over.

4377
03:08:32.806 --> 03:08:36.357
You see one of the trees begin to uproot, (creaking)

4378
03:08:36.357 --> 03:08:37.936
and begin to turn towards them,

4379
03:08:37.936 --> 03:08:39.726
Obann just looks and snaps his fingers and points.

4380
03:08:39.726 --> 03:08:41.026
The Laughing Hand turns around

4381
03:08:41.026 --> 03:08:43.523
and shreds this tree in three wide swipes.

4382
03:08:43.523 --> 03:08:46.217
The tree seems to give out a low groan

4383
03:08:46.217 --> 03:08:48.535
as it crumbles backward.

4384
03:08:48.535 --> 03:08:50.526
Make a perception check.

4385
03:08:50.526 --> 03:08:52.446
SAM: Come on, Laura.
LIAM: Come on.

4386
03:08:52.446 --> 03:08:54.196
TRAVIS: Let's go, let's go.

4387
03:08:55.445 --> 03:08:57.296
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

4388
03:08:57.296 --> 03:08:58.354
19?

4389
03:08:58.354 --> 03:09:00.426
MATT: 19, okay.

4390
03:09:00.426 --> 03:09:04.501
You gather from the

4391
03:09:04.501 --> 03:09:06.634
light from the northern end,

4392
03:09:06.634 --> 03:09:08.763
they've only just recently made it

4393
03:09:08.763 --> 03:09:11.242
through the edge of the tree line.

4394
03:09:11.242 --> 03:09:12.075
LAURA: Okay.

4395
03:09:14.032 --> 03:09:16.922
MATT: They seem to have only just begun

4396
03:09:16.922 --> 03:09:17.992
to enter wherever they are.

4397
03:09:17.992 --> 03:09:18.883
LAURA: Okay.

4398
03:09:18.883 --> 03:09:23.586
MATT: You also notice, at the base of Yasha's neck

4399
03:09:23.586 --> 03:09:27.884
as she slashes some of these branches,

4400
03:09:27.884 --> 03:09:30.638
a very, very faint orange glow

4401
03:09:30.638 --> 03:09:32.418
right at the base of the skull.

4402
03:09:32.418 --> 03:09:33.590
It peeks through some of her hair

4403
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:37.054
as it swishes past and out of the way.

4404
03:09:37.054 --> 03:09:38.926
SAM: She's jacked in.

4405
03:09:38.926 --> 03:09:41.009
(laughter)

4406
03:09:41.009 --> 03:09:44.226
MATT: A very faint orange circular ember.

4407
03:09:44.226 --> 03:09:45.725
LAURA: Okay.

4408
03:09:50.072 --> 03:09:54.572
I ask the Traveler: Does this make you nervous at all?

4409
03:09:56.815 --> 03:10:00.232
MATT: "Everything about this makes me nervous."

4410
03:10:05.029 --> 03:10:07.754
LAURA: Do I see anything else of...

4411
03:10:09.161 --> 03:10:13.904
...interest? Does it look like they're still in the swamp?

4412
03:10:13.904 --> 03:10:15.807
The Lotusden, or--?

4413
03:10:15.807 --> 03:10:18.271
MATT: It looks like they're pushing out of the swamp

4414
03:10:18.271 --> 03:10:21.265
and into some sort of a wooded space.

4415
03:10:21.265 --> 03:10:22.340
LAURA: Okay, okay.

4416
03:10:22.340 --> 03:10:25.014
MATT: I mean, it's still sloshing with some feet, like--

4417
03:10:25.014 --> 03:10:27.557
LAURA: It feels like they're at the Lotusden still.

4418
03:10:27.557 --> 03:10:28.974
MATT: Possibly.

4419
03:10:30.001 --> 03:10:32.244
It is still damp with each footfall.

4420
03:10:32.244 --> 03:10:34.848
The marsh is receding into the heavier wood,

4421
03:10:34.848 --> 03:10:35.933
which is what you notice

4422
03:10:35.933 --> 03:10:38.105
as the tree line shifting into it.

4423
03:10:38.105 --> 03:10:40.646
They're still like (squishing),

4424
03:10:40.646 --> 03:10:43.387
and that weird, wet, sucking sound with footfalls.

4425
03:10:43.387 --> 03:10:47.673
LAURA: Does it look like Obann is happy?

4426
03:10:47.673 --> 03:10:49.448
Does it look like--

4427
03:10:51.307 --> 03:10:53.098
TRAVIS: Yeah, does he look frustrated?
LAURA: Yeah, does he look frustrated

4428
03:10:53.098 --> 03:10:54.830
or does he look like he's accomplishing--

4429
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:56.821
MATT: Make an insight check.

4430
03:10:59.864 --> 03:11:02.697
LAURA: Wisdom still, that's good, okay.

4431
03:11:06.234 --> 03:11:08.304
Okay.
TALIESIN: (whistles)

4432
03:11:08.304 --> 03:11:09.517
LAURA: 19 again.

4433
03:11:09.517 --> 03:11:10.742
MATT: 19 again.

4434
03:11:11.673 --> 03:11:14.192
As you glance about, they're all pretty clustered

4435
03:11:14.192 --> 03:11:15.927
and shoulder to shoulder,

4436
03:11:15.927 --> 03:11:18.615
you know, prepared as they push forward through this jungle.

4437
03:11:18.615 --> 03:11:23.006
He looks a little frustrated,

4438
03:11:23.006 --> 03:11:24.980
if driven.

4439
03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:29.434
Like looking about, trying to just take in the surroundings,

4440
03:11:29.434 --> 03:11:32.427
their movement over the next 10 minutes or so

4441
03:11:32.427 --> 03:11:36.102
seems not wholly driven or focused.

4442
03:11:36.102 --> 03:11:37.563
LAURA: Okay.

4443
03:11:38.921 --> 03:11:43.746
MATT: You get the sense that he is essentially

4444
03:11:43.746 --> 03:11:46.117
stabbing in the dark in what he thinks to be

4445
03:11:46.117 --> 03:11:47.524
the right direction.

4446
03:11:47.524 --> 03:11:48.984
LAURA: Okay, okay.

4447
03:11:48.984 --> 03:11:51.194
MATT: Roll another perception check for me, please.

4448
03:11:51.194 --> 03:11:52.777
LAURA: Heebie jeebies.

4449
03:11:54.685 --> 03:11:57.523
God, how do I keep rolling the same number?

4450
03:11:58.740 --> 03:11:59.693
17.

4451
03:11:59.693 --> 03:12:00.965
MATT: 17, okay.

4452
03:12:00.965 --> 03:12:05.785
You do also notice at his side what looks to be

4453
03:12:05.785 --> 03:12:09.459
a bag that hangs

4454
03:12:11.634 --> 03:12:14.125
about a foot off his belt

4455
03:12:14.125 --> 03:12:18.399
and that looks to contain something roughly spherical.

4456
03:12:18.399 --> 03:12:20.212
MARISHA: He's got the head.

4457
03:12:20.212 --> 03:12:21.735
SAM: Or the heart. No, the head.

4458
03:12:21.735 --> 03:12:24.077
LAURA: He's got the head already.

4459
03:12:24.077 --> 03:12:27.000
SAM: They just need the heart.

4460
03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.777
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to the fucking Lotusden, y'all.

4461
03:12:29.777 --> 03:12:31.569
TALIESIN: We have to get there really fast.

4462
03:12:31.569 --> 03:12:33.044
SAM: That's thousands, there's no--

4463
03:12:33.044 --> 03:12:34.285
TRAVIS: We're in the Cobalt Soul, man.

4464
03:12:34.285 --> 03:12:35.849
LIAM: I have another side question, too.

4465
03:12:35.849 --> 03:12:38.731
While Jester is doing this, and everyone was focused on her,

4466
03:12:38.731 --> 03:12:40.969
can Caleb spend all that time just reading

4467
03:12:40.969 --> 03:12:43.510
the spines of books and seeing if there's anything

4468
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:48.122
that triggers his mind about his favorite hobby?

4469
03:12:48.122 --> 03:12:49.609
MATT: Define "favorite hobby."

4470
03:12:49.609 --> 03:12:50.442
LIAM: You know what I'm talking about.

4471
03:12:50.442 --> 03:12:52.642
SAM: Masturbating.
MATT: Okay, okay, sure.

4472
03:12:52.642 --> 03:12:54.772
Go ahead and make an investigation check.

4473
03:12:54.772 --> 03:12:57.010
LIAM: Am I still-- yeah, masturbating.

4474
03:12:57.010 --> 03:12:59.093
Jaggin' offs. Jagentoths.

4475
03:13:00.284 --> 03:13:02.809
LAURA: You're in the wrong library.

4476
03:13:02.809 --> 03:13:03.736
TRAVIS: Peter Tingle.

4477
03:13:03.736 --> 03:13:06.278
SAM: I spent many nights with Caleb.

4478
03:13:06.278 --> 03:13:09.338
He's a vigorous master debater.
LIAM: 29.

4479
03:13:09.338 --> 03:13:12.591
(laughter)

4480
03:13:12.591 --> 03:13:13.424
MATT: Okay.

4481
03:13:14.982 --> 03:13:17.565
There are two hobbies of yours.

4482
03:13:18.434 --> 03:13:19.910
I need to know which direction--

4483
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:22.961
LIAM: Masturbating and time.

4484
03:13:22.961 --> 03:13:26.367
MATT: There is the one that is the focus of your craft.

4485
03:13:26.367 --> 03:13:27.611
LIAM: Yeah.

4486
03:13:27.611 --> 03:13:29.228
MATT: And some of your goals there,

4487
03:13:29.228 --> 03:13:31.499
or there is the alternative one.

4488
03:13:31.499 --> 03:13:34.079
LIAM: The alternative one.
MATT: Okay.

4489
03:13:34.079 --> 03:13:36.878
Looking about, there are discussions

4490
03:13:36.878 --> 03:13:40.495
of magic altering the flow of time.

4491
03:13:42.291 --> 03:13:44.653
There are discussions of many different spells

4492
03:13:44.653 --> 03:13:46.997
that have been developed that specifically,

4493
03:13:46.997 --> 03:13:48.721
brief mentions of Slow and Haste,

4494
03:13:48.721 --> 03:13:52.083
and eventually such powerful spells as Time Stop,

4495
03:13:52.083 --> 03:13:55.504
you know, those are easily accessible.

4496
03:13:55.504 --> 03:13:59.087
There are rituals that have been attempted,

4497
03:14:00.671 --> 03:14:03.339
that have been cobbled together.

4498
03:14:03.339 --> 03:14:05.041
Arcanists of the highest level.

4499
03:14:05.041 --> 03:14:07.378
Archmages, when you reach a certain point,

4500
03:14:07.378 --> 03:14:10.232
begin to question their limits

4501
03:14:10.232 --> 03:14:14.945
and find new ways to weave the world around them.

4502
03:14:14.945 --> 03:14:17.539
Sometimes it's a fool's errand,

4503
03:14:17.539 --> 03:14:19.452
and it doesn't meet their expectations.

4504
03:14:19.452 --> 03:14:20.597
Sometimes they tap into something

4505
03:14:20.597 --> 03:14:23.089
they can't control and destroy themselves.

4506
03:14:23.089 --> 03:14:24.694
There are talks of some mages that have

4507
03:14:24.694 --> 03:14:29.694
attempted to push the flow of time to the reverse,

4508
03:14:30.481 --> 03:14:34.531
and those who have attempted it were never seen again.

4509
03:14:36.402 --> 03:14:38.818
LIAM: Do any-- last question, because I want to move forward

4510
03:14:38.818 --> 03:14:41.871
in the story, do any of those books

4511
03:14:41.871 --> 03:14:44.597
and those instances talk about...

4512
03:14:45.823 --> 03:14:49.809
places, or where those things were done?

4513
03:14:49.809 --> 03:14:53.726
MATT: One of them speaks of tales passed down from--

4514
03:14:55.574 --> 03:14:56.554
let me see.

4515
03:14:56.554 --> 03:14:57.971
There would be...

4516
03:15:02.224 --> 03:15:05.442
I'm trying to remember the actual name of the location.

4517
03:15:05.442 --> 03:15:09.400
The name escapes me at the moment, but the...

4518
03:15:11.184 --> 03:15:14.191
the magocracy that ran the floating land

4519
03:15:14.191 --> 03:15:18.040
that was the seed for the Empire,

4520
03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:21.016
one of their top mages had hoped when they were

4521
03:15:21.016 --> 03:15:24.672
losing their war against the gods--

4522
03:15:24.672 --> 03:15:29.190
and you do recall that there were many

4523
03:15:29.190 --> 03:15:30.913
mortal societies at the time

4524
03:15:30.913 --> 03:15:35.907
that embraced the power of both the scientific mind

4525
03:15:35.907 --> 03:15:38.507
and the arcane arts and believed that

4526
03:15:38.507 --> 03:15:39.881
the gods were a stepping stone,

4527
03:15:39.881 --> 03:15:44.881
or their creators had now been essentially become old news

4528
03:15:45.049 --> 03:15:47.281
and were meant to be destroyed and ascended.

4529
03:15:47.281 --> 03:15:48.967
And there were wars waged from arcane

4530
03:15:48.967 --> 03:15:52.123
against divine sources of magic.

4531
03:15:52.123 --> 03:15:54.914
In a brief stint in history,

4532
03:15:54.914 --> 03:15:58.040
the Prime Deities

4533
03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:01.180
and the Betrayer Gods did call a truce,

4534
03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:04.262
because some of these powerful nations

4535
03:16:04.262 --> 03:16:08.121
began to hunt the gods that supposedly created them,

4536
03:16:08.121 --> 03:16:12.813
and that led to a swift demise to most of these societies,

4537
03:16:12.813 --> 03:16:17.171
and that's where the ruined nation, that--

4538
03:16:18.210 --> 03:16:21.381
where Zemnian and that whole element comes from,

4539
03:16:21.381 --> 03:16:24.896
was destroyed. But one of those mages,

4540
03:16:24.896 --> 03:16:28.549
one of the top, top, top archmages of that society

4541
03:16:28.549 --> 03:16:31.512
was supposedly researching this specific thing,

4542
03:16:31.512 --> 03:16:33.253
and had pulled all of his resources

4543
03:16:33.253 --> 03:16:35.508
and had gathered this large ritual in which

4544
03:16:35.508 --> 03:16:38.963
he was hoping to go back and find a way

4545
03:16:38.963 --> 03:16:42.602
to change the fortune of this conflict,

4546
03:16:42.602 --> 03:16:47.602
and inform himself of the coming strategy

4547
03:16:47.689 --> 03:16:52.461
of the combined deities, and try and basically

4548
03:16:52.461 --> 03:16:55.273
give them the edge to win that war,

4549
03:16:55.273 --> 03:16:57.505
and was never seen again.

4550
03:16:57.505 --> 03:16:58.889
TRAVIS: Starring Scott Bakula.

4551
03:16:58.889 --> 03:17:00.475
(laughter)

4552
03:17:00.475 --> 03:17:02.083
LIAM: Ziggy!

4553
03:17:02.083 --> 03:17:02.916
MATT: Oh boy.

4554
03:17:02.916 --> 03:17:04.297
LIAM: Yeah, good then, thanks.

4555
03:17:04.297 --> 03:17:06.001
SAM: Wait.

4556
03:17:06.001 --> 03:17:07.430
Caleb.

4557
03:17:07.430 --> 03:17:12.248
Can you learn other teleportation circles here?

4558
03:17:12.248 --> 03:17:14.455
Do they have them listed or something? Can you--

4559
03:17:14.455 --> 03:17:15.869
LAURA: Is it like calling a phone number?

4560
03:17:15.869 --> 03:17:17.242
LIAM: I don't know if it's the Yellow Pages

4561
03:17:17.242 --> 03:17:19.486
for locational circles.

4562
03:17:19.486 --> 03:17:21.010
SAM: Can you ask?

4563
03:17:21.010 --> 03:17:21.930
MARISHA: I'll talk to Zeenoth.

4564
03:17:21.930 --> 03:17:24.108
SAM: At least the other Cobalt Soul-y places?

4565
03:17:24.108 --> 03:17:26.004
LIAM: Here, yeah, here, maybe they have one here.

4566
03:17:26.004 --> 03:17:27.003
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Is there anything

4567
03:17:27.003 --> 03:17:28.018
or anyone else you want to research?

4568
03:17:28.018 --> 03:17:29.070
TRAVIS: No.
LIAM: No, no, no.

4569
03:17:29.070 --> 03:17:31.068
MARISHA: I just need to talk to Zeenoth.

4570
03:17:31.068 --> 03:17:32.366
MATT: Okay, no worries, up to you.

4571
03:17:32.366 --> 03:17:33.417
LIAM: You ask.

4572
03:17:33.417 --> 03:17:34.417
MARISHA: All right.

4573
03:17:36.243 --> 03:17:37.459
Zeenoth?

4574
03:17:37.459 --> 03:17:38.747
TALIESIN: Any luck will help.

4575
03:17:38.747 --> 03:17:40.601
MATT: He comes back and finds you

4576
03:17:40.601 --> 03:17:42.967
in the middle of the Archive.

4577
03:17:42.967 --> 03:17:45.425
"Yes, you had a question?"

4578
03:17:47.944 --> 03:17:51.902
MARISHA: We need access to the teleportation circle.

4579
03:17:52.875 --> 03:17:54.958
MATT: "Where do you intend to--?"

4580
03:17:55.878 --> 03:17:58.228
TRAVIS: Ruins of Draconia, Dreemoth Ravine,

4581
03:17:58.228 --> 03:17:59.544
Lotusden Greenwood.

4582
03:17:59.544 --> 03:18:03.040
MARISHA: Yeah, and also if you have any--

4583
03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:06.537
do we keep a record of other teleportation circles?

4584
03:18:06.537 --> 03:18:10.458
Can you learn of the sigils of other circles here,

4585
03:18:10.458 --> 03:18:13.361
or do you have to physically be there?

4586
03:18:13.361 --> 03:18:17.519
MATT: "We generally do not, for the worry that

4587
03:18:17.519 --> 03:18:20.293
it can be abused."

4588
03:18:20.293 --> 03:18:21.293
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4589
03:18:23.055 --> 03:18:25.972
MATT: "Why do you re-- where are you planning to go?"

4590
03:18:27.924 --> 03:18:30.257
MARISHA: We want to follow these people

4591
03:18:30.257 --> 03:18:32.540
that attacked us here.

4592
03:18:32.540 --> 03:18:36.656
We have run-ins with them

4593
03:18:36.656 --> 03:18:38.198
in the past, and information,

4594
03:18:38.198 --> 03:18:41.286
and we think we're fairly equipped to track them down.

4595
03:18:41.286 --> 03:18:43.571
MATT: "Who are these people, if I might ask you?

4596
03:18:43.571 --> 03:18:46.749
"I don't even know the names of our attackers."

4597
03:18:46.749 --> 03:18:48.568
MARISHA: The one who seems to be the leader

4598
03:18:48.568 --> 03:18:52.718
of this particular band is named Obann.

4599
03:18:52.718 --> 03:18:55.618
LAURA: He's the dark-haired guy.

4600
03:18:55.618 --> 03:18:59.766
MARISHA: He seems to be obsessed with raising these entities

4601
03:18:59.766 --> 03:19:02.385
from the times of the Calamity.

4602
03:19:02.385 --> 03:19:03.550
TRAVIS: A devil.

4603
03:19:03.550 --> 03:19:05.397
MATT: He's going to go ahead and try and research that

4604
03:19:05.397 --> 03:19:07.015
himself, actually.

4605
03:19:07.015 --> 03:19:08.964
LAURA: He's a pretty powerful devil.

4606
03:19:08.964 --> 03:19:10.213
MATT: Natural 19, okay.

4607
03:19:10.213 --> 03:19:11.879
LAURA: We killed him, and he's not dead.

4608
03:19:11.879 --> 03:19:15.237
MARISHA: He's raising or seems to be infatuated

4609
03:19:15.237 --> 03:19:19.854
with these demons, he ended up raising this monster

4610
03:19:19.854 --> 03:19:21.987
called the Laughing Hand.

4611
03:19:21.987 --> 03:19:24.149
MATT: "I'll get to that, hold on."

4612
03:19:24.149 --> 03:19:25.304
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

4613
03:19:25.304 --> 03:19:29.171
MATT: He goes and pulls one book out

4614
03:19:29.171 --> 03:19:31.189
and dusts it off a bit and opens it,

4615
03:19:31.189 --> 03:19:33.138
and this one has a language on the cover

4616
03:19:33.138 --> 03:19:35.062
that you don't recognize.

4617
03:19:35.062 --> 03:19:36.901
Do any of you speak Abyssal?

4618
03:19:36.901 --> 03:19:38.795
Or know Abyssal?

4619
03:19:38.795 --> 03:19:40.376
TRAVIS: Nope.
SAM: Nope.

4620
03:19:40.376 --> 03:19:41.217
SAM: Yasha does.

4621
03:19:41.217 --> 03:19:42.545
LIAM: Oh.

4622
03:19:42.545 --> 03:19:45.062
I will in 10 minutes.

4623
03:19:45.062 --> 03:19:46.246
MATT: Well--

4624
03:19:46.246 --> 03:19:47.908
LIAM: Reading over his shoulder.

4625
03:19:47.908 --> 03:19:49.877
MATT: He's actually going-- you're looking over his shoulder

4626
03:19:49.877 --> 03:19:50.827
and he begins to pore through,

4627
03:19:50.827 --> 03:19:52.138
and it looks like he can read it.

4628
03:19:52.138 --> 03:19:53.149
LIAM: Oh, okay, he's fine.

4629
03:19:53.149 --> 03:19:54.971
MATT: He goes through and he goes,

4630
03:19:54.971 --> 03:19:57.622
"There is mention of a name Obann here.

4631
03:19:57.622 --> 03:20:00.114
"It speaks of a servant of Graz'zt,

4632
03:20:00.114 --> 03:20:01.937
"the Dark Prince of the Argent Palace,

4633
03:20:01.937 --> 03:20:04.928
"within the Abyssal domain of Azzatar."

4634
03:20:06.306 --> 03:20:08.967
MARISHA: Servant of Graz'zt?

4635
03:20:08.967 --> 03:20:11.916
MATT: Graz'zt, G-R-A-Z-apostrophe-Z-T.

4636
03:20:11.916 --> 03:20:14.249
MARISHA: Have we heard that before?

4637
03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:22.389
MATT: He says, "Obann was once called
Graz'zt's Master of Wills.

4638
03:20:23.759 --> 03:20:26.236
"It is said here that he was then shamed and destroyed

4639
03:20:26.236 --> 03:20:28.295
"after a terrible failure to his lord,

4640
03:20:28.295 --> 03:20:30.889
"and that's where the end of his footnote is.

4641
03:20:30.889 --> 03:20:31.962
"It's very small."

4642
03:20:31.962 --> 03:20:34.741
MARISHA: Chained and destroyed?
MATT: Shamed and destroyed.

4643
03:20:34.741 --> 03:20:35.582
MARISHA: Shamed.

4644
03:20:35.582 --> 03:20:38.045
MATT: He closes the tome.

4645
03:20:38.045 --> 03:20:39.727
MARISHA: Well, he's--

4646
03:20:39.727 --> 03:20:40.673
LAURA: He's out.

4647
03:20:40.673 --> 03:20:42.998
MARISHA: Yeah. But he's not destroyed, he's back.

4648
03:20:45.112 --> 03:20:46.397
MATT: "I'll amend it."

4649
03:20:46.397 --> 03:20:49.748
He takes out and puts another note in to amend the note.

4650
03:20:49.748 --> 03:20:51.730
TALIESIN: The Laughing Hand.

4651
03:20:51.730 --> 03:20:54.251
MARISHA: Then, yeah, anything about the Laughing Hand?

4652
03:20:54.251 --> 03:20:57.418
Man, there's a lot of demons and shit.

4653
03:20:58.683 --> 03:21:00.454
MATT: Somebody like to help him research this?

4654
03:21:00.454 --> 03:21:01.412
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

4655
03:21:01.412 --> 03:21:04.012
Guidance.

4656
03:21:04.012 --> 03:21:05.522
MARISHA: Sure.
LAURA: On him, and--

4657
03:21:05.522 --> 03:21:07.978
MATT: Are you helming it, or is he helming it?

4658
03:21:07.978 --> 03:21:10.993
MARISHA: I'll give him advantage on helming it.

4659
03:21:10.993 --> 03:21:12.143
LAURA: I'll give him Guidance.

4660
03:21:12.143 --> 03:21:13.551
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for--

4661
03:21:13.551 --> 03:21:15.098
yeah, you roll for Guidance.

4662
03:21:15.098 --> 03:21:16.506
LAURA: Okay.

4663
03:21:18.862 --> 03:21:19.695
Two.

4664
03:21:20.580 --> 03:21:22.714
MATT: All right.

4665
03:21:22.714 --> 03:21:25.368
It takes the better part of another hour, hour and a half,

4666
03:21:25.368 --> 03:21:28.471
but he does manage to pull a small book,

4667
03:21:28.471 --> 03:21:33.076
this one also pertaining to Torog specifically.

4668
03:21:33.076 --> 03:21:34.542
It looks like it's an annex to the one

4669
03:21:34.542 --> 03:21:38.010
that was researched earlier when you first arrived.

4670
03:21:38.010 --> 03:21:40.787
He pulls out the book and finds a section and goes,

4671
03:21:40.787 --> 03:21:44.093
"The Laughing Hand was once a warrior named Ganix

4672
03:21:44.093 --> 03:21:48.540
"who sought to strike down Torog with his army.

4673
03:21:48.540 --> 03:21:49.916
"His soldiers were slaughtered and himself

4674
03:21:49.916 --> 03:21:51.282
"captured and tortured.

4675
03:21:51.282 --> 03:21:52.917
"Torog twisted and cursed his body

4676
03:21:52.917 --> 03:21:55.654
"to an endless cycle of servitude,

4677
03:21:55.654 --> 03:21:57.535
"his ever-living heart locked beyond the veil

4678
03:21:57.535 --> 03:22:00.237
"to ensure an eternal pact."

4679
03:22:01.354 --> 03:22:03.173
He rummages through the rest of the pages

4680
03:22:03.173 --> 03:22:06.372
and is about to close the book,

4681
03:22:06.372 --> 03:22:08.504
then he goes to the very back and sees

4682
03:22:08.504 --> 03:22:11.751
some of the fresher notes and goes, "All right.

4683
03:22:11.751 --> 03:22:13.255
"It says here that rumor has it that his heart

4684
03:22:13.255 --> 03:22:15.542
"was set adrift in extra-planar space

4685
03:22:15.542 --> 03:22:17.735
"to ensure it was never found.

4686
03:22:17.735 --> 03:22:20.224
"Though numerous arcanists were said to have sought it

4687
03:22:20.224 --> 03:22:22.141
"for their own research.

4688
03:22:25.538 --> 03:22:27.619
"So is this the one, the one that did this?"

4689
03:22:27.619 --> 03:22:29.488
and he points to his stomach.

4690
03:22:29.488 --> 03:22:31.029
MARISHA: Yeah, he's the one.

4691
03:22:31.029 --> 03:22:35.279
MATT: "If you find him, will you do me the honor of--

4692
03:22:36.385 --> 03:22:41.215
"what's the phrase the kids say, fucking it up?"

4693
03:22:41.215 --> 03:22:43.273
MARISHA: Yeah, I would be--

4694
03:22:45.248 --> 03:22:46.656
I would be happy to.

4695
03:22:46.656 --> 03:22:49.915
MATT: "I appreciate that."
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4696
03:22:49.915 --> 03:22:51.457
LAURA: His heart, huh?

4697
03:22:52.369 --> 03:22:54.619
MARISHA: C-can I ask who all--

4698
03:22:56.052 --> 03:23:00.285
who all perished from the attacks?

4699
03:23:00.285 --> 03:23:03.001
Anyone that I know?

4700
03:23:03.001 --> 03:23:06.205
MATT: He leads you through all the different names,

4701
03:23:06.205 --> 03:23:10.463
and two of them were students you trained with,

4702
03:23:10.463 --> 03:23:13.438
and then others were people that you maybe had

4703
03:23:13.438 --> 03:23:15.531
passing knowledge of, but nobody that's specifically--

4704
03:23:15.531 --> 03:23:16.814
MARISHA: Madeer?
MATT: Hmm?

4705
03:23:16.814 --> 03:23:17.945
MARISHA: Madeer?

4706
03:23:17.945 --> 03:23:20.146
That was the other one that trained me.

4707
03:23:20.146 --> 03:23:21.400
MATT: Madeer was not on that list.

4708
03:23:21.400 --> 03:23:22.583
MARISHA: Okay.

4709
03:23:24.296 --> 03:23:26.666
SAM: Is there a teleportation circle here?

4710
03:23:26.666 --> 03:23:29.050
MARISHA: Yeah, teleportation circle, can we learn it?

4711
03:23:29.050 --> 03:23:32.291
MATT: Make a persuasion check, with advantage.

4712
03:23:32.291 --> 03:23:34.188
LAURA: I'll guide you.

4713
03:23:34.188 --> 03:23:35.146
MARISHA: With advantage?

4714
03:23:36.038 --> 03:23:37.414
SAM: Just guiding everybody.

4715
03:23:37.414 --> 03:23:38.496
LAURA: Fuck yeah, my hands--

4716
03:23:38.496 --> 03:23:39.627
LIAM: I'm about to convince you.

4717
03:23:39.627 --> 03:23:40.460
TRAVIS: Perma-guide.

4718
03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:42.592
MARISHA: Jesus.
LAURA: Hands everywhere.

4719
03:23:43.892 --> 03:23:45.285
MARISHA: 12.

4720
03:23:45.285 --> 03:23:46.837
MATT: 12.

4721
03:23:46.837 --> 03:23:49.287
Goes like, "(sighs)"

4722
03:23:49.287 --> 03:23:50.815
TALIESIN: No one likes us.

4723
03:23:50.815 --> 03:23:53.437
(laughter)

4724
03:23:53.437 --> 03:23:56.845
MATT: "Just this once, because you're going after

4725
03:23:56.845 --> 03:23:57.857
these things."

4726
03:23:57.857 --> 03:24:00.524
MARISHA: Yeah, just this once, totally.

4727
03:24:02.043 --> 03:24:06.103
MATT: "I'm not supposed to offer it out to people

4728
03:24:06.103 --> 03:24:09.368
"who aren't of the Archive, but-- follow me."

4729
03:24:09.368 --> 03:24:11.916
MARISHA: Well, you know, I'm an expositor now, so.

4730
03:24:11.916 --> 03:24:12.862
MATT: "Are you?"

4731
03:24:12.862 --> 03:24:14.241
TALIESIN: I'm just going to ask, can you take a horse

4732
03:24:14.241 --> 03:24:16.824
through a teleportation circle?

4733
03:24:16.824 --> 03:24:18.032
MARISHA: Can we take a horse through it?

4734
03:24:18.032 --> 03:24:19.199
MATT: You can.

4735
03:24:19.199 --> 03:24:21.162
LAURA: Let's take our horses.
TALIESIN: Can we take our horses?

4736
03:24:21.162 --> 03:24:21.995
MARISHA: A horse!

4737
03:24:21.995 --> 03:24:24.170
TRAVIS: Maybe we don't push the horses.

4738
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:25.899
TALIESIN: We ride the horses through the--

4739
03:24:25.899 --> 03:24:26.909
SAM: Where are we going?

4740
03:24:26.909 --> 03:24:30.009
TRAVIS: We're going to bring the
horses into the Cobalt Soul?

4741
03:24:30.009 --> 03:24:31.382
LAURA: No.
MARISHA: Sure.

4742
03:24:31.382 --> 03:24:33.093
LIAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yes.

4743
03:24:33.093 --> 03:24:36.577
MATT: You can see Zeenoth going like, "Uh--"

4744
03:24:36.577 --> 03:24:38.437
LAURA: They were 75 gold each.

4745
03:24:38.437 --> 03:24:39.270
MATT: "Okay.

4746
03:24:41.096 --> 03:24:44.596
"I'll have to be creative when writing up my paperwork.

4747
03:24:45.812 --> 03:24:47.375
"Get your horses."

4748
03:24:47.375 --> 03:24:50.019
LIAM: Hey, wild hair, while the horses are being fetched,

4749
03:24:50.019 --> 03:24:53.053
can I approach Zeenoth quietly and say,

4750
03:24:53.053 --> 03:24:56.040
Do you have any writings on the Traveler?

4751
03:24:56.040 --> 03:24:58.943
A being known as the Traveler?

4752
03:24:58.943 --> 03:25:01.002
MATT: "I believe so, yes."

4753
03:25:02.076 --> 03:25:06.425
He goes and takes the familiar book of recent cults,

4754
03:25:06.425 --> 03:25:10.087
the one where the Angel of Irons was annotated,

4755
03:25:10.087 --> 03:25:12.256
and there is another subsection there.

4756
03:25:12.256 --> 03:25:14.506
MARISHA: (laughing)

4757
03:25:16.342 --> 03:25:19.924
MATT: Hands it to you and says, "There's a small amount."

4758
03:25:19.924 --> 03:25:21.572
LIAM: It's very brief.

4759
03:25:21.572 --> 03:25:23.961
MATT: "It's more of a recent phenomenon."

4760
03:25:23.961 --> 03:25:24.794
LIAM: Yeah.

4761
03:25:25.820 --> 03:25:29.595
MATT: "Seemingly benevolent at the moment,

4762
03:25:29.595 --> 03:25:32.057
"but sparse and strange.

4763
03:25:32.057 --> 03:25:33.938
"At first, we thought it was a mass hallucination,

4764
03:25:33.938 --> 03:25:36.546
"but apparently there's enough over distances

4765
03:25:36.546 --> 03:25:39.493
"that there's some thread to it, but I worry."

4766
03:25:40.976 --> 03:25:43.349
LIAM: D-deity?

4767
03:25:43.349 --> 03:25:44.182
MATT: "Something."

4768
03:25:44.182 --> 03:25:45.178
LIAM: Something.

4769
03:25:46.548 --> 03:25:51.548
But you have heard of this individual?

4770
03:25:51.980 --> 03:25:53.877
MATT: "Well, I passed through it in my research,

4771
03:25:53.877 --> 03:25:56.046
"but I just knew where to find it.

4772
03:25:56.046 --> 03:25:57.830
"The information is there on the page."

4773
03:25:57.830 --> 03:26:01.228
LIAM: Is there any account in the brief amount here

4774
03:26:01.228 --> 03:26:05.467
of witnessing displays of the power of the Traveler?

4775
03:26:05.467 --> 03:26:07.318
MATT: No, all of them are second-hand accounts

4776
03:26:07.318 --> 03:26:11.905
from people that appear to be proselytizing

4777
03:26:11.905 --> 03:26:16.489
his power and joy and capability.

4778
03:26:17.476 --> 03:26:19.867
LIAM: Interesting, thank you.

4779
03:26:19.867 --> 03:26:22.078
Where are those horses?

4780
03:26:22.078 --> 03:26:23.030
MARISHA: Do you want to go--

4781
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:24.458
LAURA: Where are we going?

4782
03:26:24.458 --> 03:26:26.625
TRAVIS: We're going to the Lotusden.

4783
03:26:26.625 --> 03:26:28.143
LAURA: Yeah, but we can't just bamf there,

4784
03:26:28.143 --> 03:26:30.468
we have to bamf to somewhere else
with a teleportation circle.

4785
03:26:30.468 --> 03:26:31.872
MARISHA: Yeah, what's the closest circle we know?

4786
03:26:31.872 --> 03:26:33.455
TRAVIS: I wanted to know what these runes are on the map,

4787
03:26:33.455 --> 03:26:34.864
do we have those?

4788
03:26:36.248 --> 03:26:39.196
LAURA: The closest one we know is Xhorhas.

4789
03:26:39.196 --> 03:26:40.375
MARISHA: You wrote that down, right?

4790
03:26:40.375 --> 03:26:41.984
What the runes mean?

4791
03:26:41.984 --> 03:26:43.138
LIAM: What the runes mean?

4792
03:26:43.138 --> 03:26:45.065
I don't know if I wrote them down.

4793
03:26:45.065 --> 03:26:46.858
LAURA: But we did translate them.

4794
03:26:46.858 --> 03:26:48.067
MARISHA: We did.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

4795
03:26:48.067 --> 03:26:49.339
MATT: I'll find them for you.

4796
03:26:49.339 --> 03:26:50.428
LIAM: Thanks.

4797
03:26:50.428 --> 03:26:52.859
SAM: Is that very close to where we're going?

4798
03:26:52.859 --> 03:26:55.663
TRAVIS: Lotus Greenwood, the runes are right there,

4799
03:26:55.663 --> 03:26:57.503
it's this whole wooded area.

4800
03:26:57.503 --> 03:26:59.526
The ruins of Draconia are over here.

4801
03:26:59.526 --> 03:27:02.904
MATT: "Well, the teleportation circle we have here,

4802
03:27:02.904 --> 03:27:07.061
"it's a direct-- we have multiple

03:27:07.061 --> 03:27:08.939
"that go to different locations.

"We have one that goes to our archive in Rexxentrum

"and one that goes to our archive in Port Damali,

SAM: Vasselheim?
MATT: "Yes."

4811
03:27:29.219 --> 03:27:31.878
SAM: Oh. I've never heard of that place.

4812
03:27:31.878 --> 03:27:33.762
LAURA and MARISHA: Any in Draconia?

4813
03:27:33.762 --> 03:27:38.031
MATT: "No, Draconia's been gone for two decades."

4814
03:27:38.031 --> 03:27:39.709
MARISHA: Rosohna?

4815
03:27:39.709 --> 03:27:41.641
MATT: "No. (chuckles)"

4816
03:27:41.641 --> 03:27:42.888
MARISHA: Yeah.

4817
03:27:42.888 --> 03:27:45.673
MATT: "Sorry, we have no specific dealings with the Dynasty,

4818
03:27:45.673 --> 03:27:47.840
"especially in these times."

4819
03:27:49.844 --> 03:27:51.160
LAURA: Oh yeah.

4820
03:27:52.493 --> 03:27:54.250
SAM: Well, you can just take us back to Xhorhas

4821
03:27:54.250 --> 03:27:55.941
whenever you want.

4822
03:27:55.941 --> 03:27:58.000
LIAM: That is correct.

4823
03:27:58.000 --> 03:27:59.869
LAURA: We say quietly, we say very quietly.

4824
03:27:59.869 --> 03:28:01.282
MARISHA: But we still want to see this one,

4825
03:28:01.282 --> 03:28:04.460
so we can get back to it, right?

4826
03:28:04.460 --> 03:28:06.545
SAM: Let's go check it out.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4827
03:28:06.545 --> 03:28:08.231
SAM: Make sure it'll fit our horses.

4828
03:28:08.231 --> 03:28:09.584
MARISHA: Yeah.

4829
03:28:09.584 --> 03:28:11.055
LIAM: Rexxentrum, perhaps.

4830
03:28:11.055 --> 03:28:12.120
TRAVIS: Go check it out.

4831
03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:14.313
MATT: "All right, this way then."

4832
03:28:14.313 --> 03:28:16.231
He, you know, still helping him along,

4833
03:28:16.231 --> 03:28:17.586
he leans on your shoulder a bit.

4834
03:28:17.586 --> 03:28:21.016
He leads you towards another downward staircase,

4835
03:28:21.016 --> 03:28:23.350
maybe about a two-minute walk away

4836
03:28:23.350 --> 03:28:25.252
from the one that leads to the repository,

4837
03:28:25.252 --> 03:28:26.739
the subterranean repository.

4838
03:28:26.739 --> 03:28:29.920
There he goes into a circular chamber

4839
03:28:29.920 --> 03:28:33.498
that goes into multiple rooms,

4840
03:28:33.498 --> 03:28:35.507
and each of these doors, you can see marked

4841
03:28:35.507 --> 03:28:39.545
as to the locations of these various archives

4842
03:28:39.545 --> 03:28:42.413
of the Cobalt Soul.
LAURA: So organized.

4843
03:28:42.413 --> 03:28:44.783
MATT: Opens the door to the Rexxentrum one.

4844
03:28:44.783 --> 03:28:47.697
In the center of the room, there is a sigil

4845
03:28:47.697 --> 03:28:49.941
that you recognize as the base sigil.

4846
03:28:49.941 --> 03:28:53.321
This is where all the other teleportation circles

4847
03:28:53.321 --> 03:28:56.245
that probably are part of this network all come back to.

4848
03:28:56.245 --> 03:28:57.572
LIAM: Yeah.

4849
03:28:57.572 --> 03:28:59.074
MATT: So you look at it.
LIAM: See it.

4850
03:28:59.074 --> 03:29:01.351
MATT: Memorize it, it's in your head.

4851
03:29:01.351 --> 03:29:03.096
"To Rexxentrum, then?"

4852
03:29:03.096 --> 03:29:05.617
LIAM: Oh, that's quick.

4853
03:29:05.617 --> 03:29:07.884
SAM: Hey, hey. Hey.

4854
03:29:07.884 --> 03:29:10.501
MATT: Which by the way, as you guys came through the library

4855
03:29:10.501 --> 03:29:12.584
on horseback-- (clopping)

4856
03:29:12.584 --> 03:29:13.941
(laughter)

4857
03:29:13.941 --> 03:29:15.746
in this giant marble hall, the open space,

4858
03:29:15.746 --> 03:29:19.312
the echoing sound of multiple horses coming through,

4859
03:29:19.312 --> 03:29:22.257
every single person there stopped what they were doing

4860
03:29:22.257 --> 03:29:24.804
and just watched as you slowly--

4861
03:29:24.804 --> 03:29:26.704
TRAVIS: Let's hope those horses didn't shit.

4862
03:29:26.704 --> 03:29:29.065
TALIESIN: I explain to the horses--
MATT: A couple of them did.

4863
03:29:29.065 --> 03:29:31.030
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll explain to the horses
what's about to happen.

4864
03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:33.354
I think they're agreeable.

4865
03:29:33.354 --> 03:29:34.662
MATT: Their stomachs, however.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4866
03:29:34.662 --> 03:29:35.821
MATT: When you got to go.

4867
03:29:35.821 --> 03:29:37.779
TALIESIN: I didn't say they couldn't poop.

4868
03:29:37.779 --> 03:29:41.471
SAM: Of course we want to do stuff here,

4869
03:29:41.471 --> 03:29:43.908
but if we go to Rexxentrum real quick,

4870
03:29:43.908 --> 03:29:45.266
you could learn the sigil there,

4871
03:29:45.266 --> 03:29:46.971
and then we could always get there.

4872
03:29:46.971 --> 03:29:47.804
LAURA: That's true.

4873
03:29:47.804 --> 03:29:48.829
MARISHA: Then come back to Zadash.
SAM: And then we could come

4874
03:29:48.829 --> 03:29:50.154
right back here.

4875
03:29:51.581 --> 03:29:54.744
LAURA: That's a really good idea.

4876
03:29:54.744 --> 03:29:55.662
LIAM: Yeah.

4877
03:29:55.662 --> 03:29:58.293
MARISHA: Okay, let's do it.

4878
03:29:58.293 --> 03:30:00.268
Zeenoth?
MATT: "Yes?"

4879
03:30:00.268 --> 03:30:02.417
MARISHA: Might be a quick round trip.

4880
03:30:02.417 --> 03:30:05.460
TRAVIS: Build the fucking way points.

4881
03:30:05.460 --> 03:30:06.874
MARISHA: Just real quick.

4882
03:30:06.874 --> 03:30:08.499
Just wait here.

4883
03:30:08.499 --> 03:30:11.379
SAM: We're right back with horses. (laughing)

4884
03:30:11.379 --> 03:30:14.807
Actually, only a couple of us need to go-- well, whatever.

4885
03:30:14.807 --> 03:30:16.117
TRAVIS: Just Caleb needs to go.
MATT: "All right."

4886
03:30:16.117 --> 03:30:17.816
LIAM: No, I think we should all go.
SAM: Okay.

4887
03:30:17.816 --> 03:30:19.665
LAURA: Okay, we all go.
MATT: "Quickly, please."

4888
03:30:19.665 --> 03:30:20.879
LIAM: These horses need to see Rexxentrum.

4889
03:30:20.879 --> 03:30:23.398
MATT: "I could get in serious trouble for this, so quickly."

4890
03:30:23.398 --> 03:30:25.031
MARISHA: Nah!

4891
03:30:25.031 --> 03:30:25.864
It'll be fine.

4892
03:30:25.864 --> 03:30:27.095
LIAM: (neighs)

4893
03:30:27.095 --> 03:30:28.827
MATT: You guys all one by one make your way

4894
03:30:28.827 --> 03:30:30.507
into this hallway in the Rexxentrum chamber.

4895
03:30:30.507 --> 03:30:32.366
You can see there's the sigil on the ground,

4896
03:30:32.366 --> 03:30:35.732
the very very faint pulsating glow of arcane energy

4897
03:30:35.732 --> 03:30:39.200
carved into its beautifully set

4898
03:30:39.200 --> 03:30:43.234
runic ornamentation and setting.

4899
03:30:44.401 --> 03:30:46.192
It's permanent, you guys can step in.

4900
03:30:46.192 --> 03:30:47.953
LIAM: All right.

4901
03:30:47.953 --> 03:30:49.584
Horse apples falling behind.
MATT: Yep.

4902
03:30:49.584 --> 03:30:52.015
One by one, on horseback, you're all

4903
03:30:52.015 --> 03:30:56.129
brought through the circle, appearing on

4904
03:30:56.129 --> 03:30:59.319
a familiar-- a larger chamber, although of similar

4905
03:30:59.319 --> 03:31:02.923
type of sculpt and design, as all of you and your horses

4906
03:31:02.923 --> 03:31:06.414
emerge on the opposite end, there you stand

4907
03:31:06.414 --> 03:31:08.359
in another chamber.

4908
03:31:08.359 --> 03:31:10.978
There is a door that is closed that leads outside this--

4909
03:31:10.978 --> 03:31:12.923
SAM: Is there anything on the floor?

4910
03:31:12.923 --> 03:31:16.044
LAURA: Yeah, but this isn't the--
MATT: On the floor in here? No.

4911
03:31:16.044 --> 03:31:17.112
SAM: (gasps)

4912
03:31:17.112 --> 03:31:19.014
LAURA: No, the teleportation circle will be in another room,

4913
03:31:19.014 --> 03:31:22.261
the one that leads--
SAM: We got to find it.

4914
03:31:22.261 --> 03:31:24.104
MATT: Wait, no, actually no, I'm sorry.

4915
03:31:24.104 --> 03:31:26.785
This room here-- I misremembered that, sorry.

4916
03:31:26.785 --> 03:31:29.505
This room you're in right now has multiple doors around you.

4917
03:31:29.505 --> 03:31:31.037
It's akin to the one that you first got to,

4918
03:31:31.037 --> 03:31:32.259
so there is a symbol on the ground,

4919
03:31:32.259 --> 03:31:35.056
and there are other doors that lead to the other ones.

4920
03:31:35.056 --> 03:31:36.885
LAURA: So we do, oh-- so that's the one you--

4921
03:31:36.885 --> 03:31:38.019
SAM: Go, go.

4922
03:31:38.019 --> 03:31:39.806
Look at that symbol.

4923
03:31:39.806 --> 03:31:41.109
LAURA: Wait a minute.

4924
03:31:41.109 --> 03:31:44.129
If you open up all the doors, do you get to--

4925
03:31:44.129 --> 03:31:46.610
LIAM: They're all here, it's the same location.

4926
03:31:46.610 --> 03:31:48.666
MATT: You hear a door open from above

4927
03:31:48.666 --> 03:31:51.262
and footsteps coming down the stairs now. (thumping)

4928
03:31:51.262 --> 03:31:53.323
TRAVIS: Get out, get out, let's go back, let's go back.

4929
03:31:53.323 --> 03:31:54.376
MATT: You don't know.

4930
03:31:54.376 --> 03:31:55.846
You just hear footsteps, multiple--

4931
03:31:55.846 --> 03:31:58.654
because suddenly a bunch of clomping horses arrived

4932
03:31:58.654 --> 03:32:00.920
and began marching around echoing through

4933
03:32:00.920 --> 03:32:02.837
in a subterranean chamber that is under watch and key.
MARISHA: It takes him like 10 minutes, though, right?

4934
03:32:02.837 --> 03:32:04.739
Takes you a minute?

4935
03:32:04.739 --> 03:32:07.006
LIAM: To do it myself, but we just arrived.

4936
03:32:07.006 --> 03:32:10.334
It's still here in this room. Is this the exit back

4937
03:32:10.334 --> 03:32:11.580
to where we came from?

4938
03:32:11.580 --> 03:32:13.038
MATT: There are other doors that are marked

4939
03:32:13.038 --> 03:32:16.780
to Zadash, Port Damali, you know, Vasselheim.

4940
03:32:16.780 --> 03:32:19.125
MARISHA: Wait, go through Port Damali,
we can get that one, too!

4941
03:32:19.125 --> 03:32:20.410
(laughter)

4942
03:32:20.410 --> 03:32:23.518
(all talking at once)

4943
03:32:23.518 --> 03:32:26.497
LIAM: Caleb rides towards the Port Damali one.

4944
03:32:26.497 --> 03:32:28.763
MATT: The door isn't open! Who's going to open the door?!

4945
03:32:28.763 --> 03:32:30.009
LAURA: I open it, I open it.

4946
03:32:30.009 --> 03:32:31.606
MATT: From the top of your horse?

4947
03:32:31.606 --> 03:32:32.776
(laughter)

4948
03:32:32.776 --> 03:32:35.408
SAM: I'll get down and pick the lock!
MARISHA: Pick the lock, go, go, go!

4949
03:32:35.408 --> 03:32:37.927
MATT: Make a lockpicking check.
MARISHA: Get those waypoints!

4950
03:32:37.927 --> 03:32:39.434
SAM: Natural one!

4951
03:32:39.434 --> 03:32:41.589
(laughter)

4952
03:32:41.589 --> 03:32:43.286
MATT: Your lockpick breaks.

4953
03:32:43.286 --> 03:32:44.982
SAM: Aw, fuck!
LAURA: Oh no!

4954
03:32:44.982 --> 03:32:46.363
MATT: You need new thieves' tools.

4955
03:32:46.363 --> 03:32:48.086
LAURA: I have some, I have some, here.

4956
03:32:48.086 --> 03:32:51.455
MATT: At this point, you can see two figures rushing down--

4957
03:32:51.455 --> 03:32:53.111
LAURA: No, that was Vex.

4958
03:32:53.111 --> 03:32:55.975
MATT: --wearing familiar robes of the Cobalt Soul,

4959
03:32:55.975 --> 03:32:59.419
along with two Righteous Brand soldiers.

4960
03:32:59.419 --> 03:33:01.052
MARISHA: Ooh! I go up.

4961
03:33:01.052 --> 03:33:02.379
MATT: "Hello, who's there?

4962
03:33:02.379 --> 03:33:04.280
"You, stop, stop, who's there?!"

4963
03:33:04.280 --> 03:33:06.206
What are you doing, what are you doing?

4964
03:33:06.206 --> 03:33:08.189
MARISHA: Are you picking the lock?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

4965
03:33:08.189 --> 03:33:09.451
SAM: I can't.

4966
03:33:09.451 --> 03:33:12.413
Either deceive them or kill them.

4967
03:33:12.413 --> 03:33:13.776
I'm working on it!

4968
03:33:13.776 --> 03:33:15.059
MARISHA: Okay.

4969
03:33:15.059 --> 03:33:16.206
It's fine.

4970
03:33:16.206 --> 03:33:17.039
Hey.

4971
03:33:17.039 --> 03:33:18.625
TRAVIS: What's the door made of?

4972
03:33:18.625 --> 03:33:20.146
What's the door made of?

4973
03:33:20.146 --> 03:33:21.330
The Port Damali door.

4974
03:33:21.330 --> 03:33:23.413
MATT: All of the doors appear to be made of

4975
03:33:23.413 --> 03:33:25.288
some sort of a

4976
03:33:27.446 --> 03:33:30.304
light-stained gray wood maybe.

4977
03:33:30.304 --> 03:33:32.643
LAURA: I'm going to tap Beau on the back

4978
03:33:32.643 --> 03:33:35.693
and enhance her ability for charisma checks.

4979
03:33:35.693 --> 03:33:37.800
MATT: Okay, you begin casting a spell?

4980
03:33:37.800 --> 03:33:39.533
SAM: Oh boy.
LAURA: Oh no.

4981
03:33:39.533 --> 03:33:41.078
Is it bad?

4982
03:33:41.078 --> 03:33:44.530
MATT: Well, as you begin to make the incantation,

4983
03:33:44.530 --> 03:33:47.588
both of the soldiers go, "She's a caster!"

4984
03:33:47.588 --> 03:33:50.913
and they immediately take out two crossbows and fire at you.

4985
03:33:50.913 --> 03:33:52.819
MARISHA: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

4986
03:33:52.819 --> 03:33:54.530
Wait, stop, stop, hold.

4987
03:33:54.530 --> 03:33:55.713
MATT: They have let loose.

4988
03:33:55.713 --> 03:33:57.774
MARISHA: I'm in Cobalt Reserve clothes, come on!

4989
03:33:57.774 --> 03:33:59.718
SAM: We just broke into their house--

4990
03:33:59.718 --> 03:34:02.045
MATT: You just broke in to the subterranean area

4991
03:34:02.045 --> 03:34:04.973
on horseback while trying to break through--

4992
03:34:04.973 --> 03:34:06.658
LIAM: We would've had to murder our way

4993
03:34:06.658 --> 03:34:08.241
through the other location.

4994
03:34:08.241 --> 03:34:09.488
MATT: Hold on, hold on.

4995
03:34:09.488 --> 03:34:11.358
LAURA: But it is really on guard right now.

4996
03:34:11.358 --> 03:34:12.752
LIAM: We are obviously insane.

4997
03:34:12.752 --> 03:34:14.806
No one's arguing that.
MATT: 15 and a 22.

4998
03:34:14.806 --> 03:34:16.059
LAURA: 22.

4999
03:34:16.059 --> 03:34:19.236
MATT: All right, one crossbow bolt catches you

5000
03:34:19.236 --> 03:34:21.106
for six points of piercing damage.

5001
03:34:21.106 --> 03:34:21.939
LAURA: Ow!

5002
03:34:21.939 --> 03:34:24.597
MATT: Like right in the lower abdomen,

5003
03:34:24.597 --> 03:34:27.253
right where the floating rib is, sticks in,

5004
03:34:27.253 --> 03:34:30.088
and the two other monks are like, whoa whoa whoa,

5005
03:34:30.088 --> 03:34:31.629
wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

5006
03:34:31.629 --> 03:34:32.712
TALIESIN: Not cool.
MARISHA: The fuck!

5007
03:34:32.712 --> 03:34:34.060
TALIESIN: Not cool.

5008
03:34:34.060 --> 03:34:35.396
LAURA: Ow, my pancreas!

5009
03:34:35.396 --> 03:34:38.169
(laughter)

5010
03:34:38.169 --> 03:34:41.628
MATT: One of the individuals (laughs) steps forward.

5011
03:34:41.628 --> 03:34:45.511
You can see a grayish-green

5012
03:34:45.511 --> 03:34:48.711
half-orc visage.

5013
03:34:48.711 --> 03:34:52.445
Older, thin, with multiple chins

5014
03:34:52.445 --> 03:34:55.064
of like skinfold from just age and sagging,

5015
03:34:55.064 --> 03:34:57.894
older orc steps forward, white hair

5016
03:34:57.894 --> 03:35:00.865
that goes long down the back.

5017
03:35:00.865 --> 03:35:05.573
"Excuse me, what is going on here?"

5018
03:35:05.573 --> 03:35:10.561
MARISHA: Sorry, Expositor Beauregard from--

5019
03:35:10.561 --> 03:35:13.041
MATT: Two guards (clicking) reload the crossbows,

5020
03:35:13.041 --> 03:35:14.288
and just waiting.

5021
03:35:14.288 --> 03:35:17.555
MARISHA: Expositor Beauregard from Zadash, Cobalt Soul.

5022
03:35:17.555 --> 03:35:22.388
We're here tracking fucking assholes,

5023
03:35:22.388 --> 03:35:24.173
and we were supposed to be here.

5024
03:35:24.173 --> 03:35:27.877
There's probably a message waiting for you all somewhere.

5025
03:35:27.877 --> 03:35:30.233
I know how communication gets lost,

5026
03:35:30.233 --> 03:35:32.603
but it was a quick turnaround

5027
03:35:32.603 --> 03:35:35.445
in terms of notification on letting you all know

5028
03:35:35.445 --> 03:35:37.112
that we were coming.

5029
03:35:38.103 --> 03:35:40.619
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

5030
03:35:40.619 --> 03:35:41.592
MARISHA: Not deception?

5031
03:35:41.592 --> 03:35:44.658
MATT: No, 'cause you're telling the truth.

5032
03:35:44.658 --> 03:35:47.517
MARISHA: No, we didn't send notice.
LAURA: Yeah.

5033
03:35:47.517 --> 03:35:49.061
MATT: Well, no no no.

5034
03:35:49.061 --> 03:35:51.855
SAM: But you're an expositor.

5035
03:35:51.855 --> 03:35:53.246
LAURA: Advantage.

5036
03:35:53.246 --> 03:35:56.765
MARISHA: I was trying to purposefully lie so I could--

5037
03:35:56.765 --> 03:36:00.604
MATT: You hid a tiny lie in a lot of information.

5038
03:36:00.604 --> 03:36:03.559
I'll say either you can roll persuasion

5039
03:36:03.559 --> 03:36:07.062
or deception with disadvantage, your choice.

5040
03:36:07.062 --> 03:36:10.855
MARISHA: I have, hang on, because you gave me--

5041
03:36:10.855 --> 03:36:12.998
LAURA: I don't know if I got my full spell out though,

5042
03:36:12.998 --> 03:36:14.131
before they shot me.

5043
03:36:14.131 --> 03:36:15.872
MATT: You can make a concentration check, actually,

5044
03:36:15.872 --> 03:36:18.788
so roll a constitution saving throw.

5045
03:36:19.919 --> 03:36:20.752
LAURA: 11.

5046
03:36:21.748 --> 03:36:23.857
MATT: 11, yeah, you maintain, so you would have advantage.

5047
03:36:23.857 --> 03:36:25.427
The spell does continue.

5048
03:36:25.427 --> 03:36:26.260
MARISHA: Okay.

5049
03:36:28.607 --> 03:36:29.929
(groans)

5050
03:36:29.929 --> 03:36:31.996
That was so close to being fucking awesome.

5051
03:36:31.996 --> 03:36:33.656
Nine!

5052
03:36:33.656 --> 03:36:34.823
MATT: Nine?
MARISHA: Nine.

5053
03:36:36.489 --> 03:36:38.489
MATT: "(sighs)"

5054
03:36:39.655 --> 03:36:41.811
MARISHA: Look, you heard about the attacks, right?

5055
03:36:41.811 --> 03:36:42.939
That just happened.

5056
03:36:42.939 --> 03:36:45.364
MATT: "Yes, of course, and why do you think we have such

5057
03:36:45.364 --> 03:36:47.484
"defense--" and you hear other footsteps coming

5058
03:36:47.484 --> 03:36:49.167
and other soldiers coming downstairs.

5059
03:36:49.167 --> 03:36:51.235
"We are on extremely high alert,

5060
03:36:51.235 --> 03:36:53.045
"and if you are who you say you are,

5061
03:36:53.045 --> 03:36:55.060
"you should know not to just appear in here."

5062
03:36:55.060 --> 03:36:57.657
LAURA: I need a healer.

5063
03:36:57.657 --> 03:36:58.738
SAM: Oh no.

5064
03:36:58.738 --> 03:36:59.862
LAURA: I'm in so much pain.

5065
03:36:59.862 --> 03:37:01.982
SAM: My older sister is dying.
MATT: Four Righteous Brand

5066
03:37:01.982 --> 03:37:02.890
soldiers come in.

5067
03:37:02.890 --> 03:37:04.068
MARISHA: Aww, jeez, what, why?

5068
03:37:04.068 --> 03:37:05.400
MATT: And now they've circled around,

5069
03:37:05.400 --> 03:37:07.512
crossbows at the ready, four of them have crossbows,

5070
03:37:07.512 --> 03:37:11.045
two of them blades out, and he goes like, "Hold on, hold on.

5071
03:37:14.202 --> 03:37:16.792
"With no word in advance and with the heightened security

5072
03:37:16.792 --> 03:37:20.596
"we're having to maintain because of these said events,

5073
03:37:20.596 --> 03:37:22.266
"I'm going to have to ask you to wait here

5074
03:37:22.266 --> 03:37:25.102
"and go through processing and approval

5075
03:37:25.102 --> 03:37:26.895
"from the high archivist."

5076
03:37:26.895 --> 03:37:29.246
LIAM: (whistles)
TRAVIS: Yep.

5077
03:37:29.246 --> 03:37:31.746
MARISHA: Here's the thing.

5078
03:37:31.746 --> 03:37:34.186
We're in a really big hurry.

5079
03:37:34.186 --> 03:37:36.978
MATT: "Then you shouldn't have just appeared here with six horses

5080
03:37:36.978 --> 03:37:40.409
"in the middle of dangerous a time period for our people."

5081
03:37:40.409 --> 03:37:41.693
(laughter)

5082
03:37:41.693 --> 03:37:42.526
MARISHA: Right.

5083
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:48.362
I get that, and I understand the sentiment, but--

5084
03:37:48.362 --> 03:37:51.138
MATT: "Look, I know every expositor on the list here,

5085
03:37:51.138 --> 03:37:54.016
"and I have not heard of an Expositor Beauregard."

5086
03:37:54.016 --> 03:37:55.401
LAURA: She was just promoted.

5087
03:37:55.401 --> 03:37:57.767
MATT: "Well, word didn't get to us, did it?"

5088
03:37:57.767 --> 03:38:00.412
LAURA: Apparently a lot of things don't get to you.

5089
03:38:00.412 --> 03:38:01.586
MARISHA: Exactly, maybe that's--

5090
03:38:01.586 --> 03:38:04.226
MATT: Two guards like (clicking) crossbows--
LAURA: Ow!

5091
03:38:04.226 --> 03:38:06.146
LIAM: Waiting a little bit seems fair to me.

5092
03:38:06.146 --> 03:38:08.631
You are able to communicate with Zadash, correct?

5093
03:38:08.631 --> 03:38:10.597
MATT: "We will reach out."

5094
03:38:10.597 --> 03:38:12.433
LIAM: Yeah, we will sit tight.

5095
03:38:12.433 --> 03:38:14.938
Sorry for the inconvenience.

5096
03:38:14.938 --> 03:38:17.385
This is awkward, but we do have the best of intentions,

5097
03:38:17.385 --> 03:38:19.668
as hard as that is to believe.
LAURA: We are the good guys.

5098
03:38:19.668 --> 03:38:21.493
MATT: "I will need each of your names, please,

5099
03:38:21.493 --> 03:38:22.418
"starting with you."

5100
03:38:22.418 --> 03:38:23.520
TRAVIS: Fjord.

5101
03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:25.553
MATT: "Just Fjord?"

5102
03:38:25.553 --> 03:38:27.697
TRAVIS: Did I offer another name?

5103
03:38:27.697 --> 03:38:28.824
MATT: "Fjord.

5104
03:38:28.824 --> 03:38:30.240
"You are?"

5105
03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:33.793
MARISHA: Expositor Beauregard.

5106
03:38:33.793 --> 03:38:35.562
MATT: "Just Beauregard."

5107
03:38:35.562 --> 03:38:37.095
MARISHA: Yeah, man!

5108
03:38:38.714 --> 03:38:42.984
MATT: "(sighs) Why the surname has gone out of fashion,
I don't know.

5109
03:38:42.984 --> 03:38:43.817
"Your name?"

5110
03:38:43.817 --> 03:38:45.760
LIAM: Hello, my name is Caleb Widogast.

5111
03:38:45.760 --> 03:38:47.384
MATT: "Caleb Widogast."

5112
03:38:47.384 --> 03:38:49.176
LAURA: Ooh, ooh.

5113
03:38:49.176 --> 03:38:52.100
SAM: Nott the Brave.

5114
03:38:52.100 --> 03:38:53.170
(laughter)

5115
03:38:53.170 --> 03:38:54.441
MATT: "You are?"

5116
03:38:54.441 --> 03:38:55.750
LAURA: Jester Lavore.

5117
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:57.001
MATT: "Jester Lavore. And you are?"

5118
03:38:57.001 --> 03:38:58.457
TALIESIN: Caduceus Clay.

5119
03:38:58.457 --> 03:39:00.601
MATT: "Caduceus Clay.

5120
03:39:00.601 --> 03:39:02.059
"(sighs)"

5121
03:39:02.059 --> 03:39:03.144
MARISHA: How long is this going to take?

5122
03:39:03.144 --> 03:39:04.654
TALIESIN: Heal this real quick.

5123
03:39:04.654 --> 03:39:07.510
LAURA: Don't do it, don't cast any spells.
They're trigger happy!

5124
03:39:07.510 --> 03:39:09.374
Don't cast any spells. I'm just going to

5125
03:39:09.374 --> 03:39:10.812
sit here and suffer.

5126
03:39:10.812 --> 03:39:12.317
LIAM: Just take a breath.

5127
03:39:12.317 --> 03:39:15.197
Appreciate what this looks like from their point of view.

5128
03:39:15.197 --> 03:39:17.526
We will work all this out.

5129
03:39:17.526 --> 03:39:19.087
MATT: "I'll be back,"

5130
03:39:19.087 --> 03:39:22.086
and turns around, leaves up the stairs,

5131
03:39:22.086 --> 03:39:24.645
and the guards stay, the other monk awkwardly

5132
03:39:24.645 --> 03:39:27.462
looks at everyone, and then follows behind.

5133
03:39:27.462 --> 03:39:29.340
Now you have the six Righteous Brand soldiers

5134
03:39:29.340 --> 03:39:31.066
here trained on you, just looking over you all

5135
03:39:31.066 --> 03:39:35.512
like carefully, looking over your faces to remember them.

5136
03:39:35.512 --> 03:39:36.887
TRAVIS: Six on six?

5137
03:39:38.009 --> 03:39:39.146
LAURA: We could take them.

5138
03:39:39.146 --> 03:39:41.797
TALIESIN: I'm going to ask the horses to
stare back at them, too.

5139
03:39:41.797 --> 03:39:44.722
LAURA: I'm going to stare at the one that shot me.

5140
03:39:44.722 --> 03:39:46.090
SAM: To Zadash!

5141
03:39:46.090 --> 03:39:48.246
(laughter)

5142
03:39:48.246 --> 03:39:52.049
LAURA: I'm going to start crying, just a single tear

5143
03:39:52.049 --> 03:39:56.716
down my cheek, with the saddest expression I can muster.

5144
03:39:58.282 --> 03:40:00.805
MATT: He seems unmoved.

5145
03:40:00.805 --> 03:40:01.638
LAURA: Mmm.

5146
03:40:02.705 --> 03:40:04.721
He hasn't really seen my charm yet.

5147
03:40:04.721 --> 03:40:07.002
MATT: 10 minutes pass.

5148
03:40:07.002 --> 03:40:09.121
20 minutes pass.

5149
03:40:09.121 --> 03:40:10.544
SAM: Oh boy.

5150
03:40:10.544 --> 03:40:12.473
MATT: Four more soldiers come down and join them.

5151
03:40:12.473 --> 03:40:14.035
MARISHA: What?
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

5152
03:40:14.035 --> 03:40:15.868
SAM: They know our names.

5153
03:40:17.603 --> 03:40:19.732
TRAVIS: Are we sitting on horseback this whole time?

5154
03:40:19.732 --> 03:40:22.463
MATT: Yep, this whole time, in a very small room.

5155
03:40:22.463 --> 03:40:23.646
You guys all like--

5156
03:40:23.646 --> 03:40:25.142
LAURA: This room is filling up with poop.

5157
03:40:25.142 --> 03:40:27.075
MATT: Especially Caduceus, you're having to like,

5158
03:40:27.075 --> 03:40:29.318
lean forward a bit.

5159
03:40:29.318 --> 03:40:34.017
Eventually the half-orc returns, and,

5160
03:40:36.786 --> 03:40:41.544
"Word has returned from the Archive of Zadash."

5161
03:40:43.942 --> 03:40:46.022
LIAM: We just burned Zeenoth so bad.

5162
03:40:46.022 --> 03:40:51.022
MATT: "You have been given temporary rights of passage,

5163
03:40:54.468 --> 03:40:59.468
"but you are also, until further notice,

5164
03:40:59.926 --> 03:41:03.391
"banned from the Rexxentrum Archive."

5165
03:41:03.391 --> 03:41:05.063
LAURA: We didn't even mean to come here--

5166
03:41:05.063 --> 03:41:06.444
TRAVIS: Sounds fair, thank you.

5167
03:41:06.444 --> 03:41:07.741
LAURA: We were trying to get to Port Damali.

5168
03:41:07.741 --> 03:41:10.187
We came to the wrong thing anyway.

5169
03:41:10.187 --> 03:41:13.787
LIAM: So banned from the Archive.

5170
03:41:13.787 --> 03:41:17.004
Understood, does that include the teleportation?

5171
03:41:17.004 --> 03:41:19.541
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
SAM: (laughing)

5172
03:41:19.541 --> 03:41:24.541
TRAVIS: Let's go to the Port Damali circle with haste,
shall we?

5173
03:41:24.661 --> 03:41:27.715
LAURA: We're just going to go back to where we meant to go

5174
03:41:27.715 --> 03:41:28.738
in the first place.

5175
03:41:28.738 --> 03:41:30.113
MATT: The half-orc shuffles over and pulls out a

5176
03:41:30.113 --> 03:41:32.788
ring of keys and unlocks the door to Port Damali

5177
03:41:32.788 --> 03:41:35.688
and opens it and steps back and just--

5178
03:41:35.688 --> 03:41:37.001
SAM: What was your name again, by the way?

5179
03:41:37.001 --> 03:41:38.851
MARISHA: Yeah.

5180
03:41:38.851 --> 03:41:40.620
MATT: You're asking the half-orc, which one?

5181
03:41:40.620 --> 03:41:43.362
MARISHA: Yeah! What's his name?

5182
03:41:43.362 --> 03:41:45.731
MATT: Look through my notes here, because--

5183
03:41:45.731 --> 03:41:49.682
SAM: You didn't think we were going to do Rexxentrum
TRAVIS: --outta nowhere.

5184
03:41:49.682 --> 03:41:50.966
(laughter)

5185
03:41:50.966 --> 03:41:52.886
Just jump around the goddamn globe.

5186
03:41:52.886 --> 03:41:54.894
SAM: ♪ Where in the world ♪

5187
03:41:54.894 --> 03:41:57.437
(laughter)

5188
03:41:57.437 --> 03:41:59.257
TRAVIS: (whooshing)

5189
03:41:59.257 --> 03:42:00.804
LIAM: Carmen Sandiego, returning to Netflix,

5190
03:42:00.804 --> 03:42:02.693
season two, October 1.

5191
03:42:02.693 --> 03:42:04.284
Catch me there.

5192
03:42:04.284 --> 03:42:06.014
(laughter)

5193
03:42:06.014 --> 03:42:07.698
MATT: Kathedoc.

5194
03:42:07.698 --> 03:42:09.369
Archivist Kathedoc.

5195
03:42:09.369 --> 03:42:10.370
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
LIAM: Archivist Kathedoc.

5196
03:42:10.370 --> 03:42:11.418
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

5197
03:42:11.418 --> 03:42:13.438
LAURA: (giggles)

5198
03:42:13.438 --> 03:42:14.271
TALIESIN: Wow.

5199
03:42:14.271 --> 03:42:16.344
MATT: Just gives you the nod of

5200
03:42:16.344 --> 03:42:19.262
please get the fuck out of my place, the look.

5201
03:42:19.262 --> 03:42:20.356
SAM: Absolutely.

5202
03:42:20.356 --> 03:42:22.689
MARISHA: Hey, can you send message to Port Damali

5203
03:42:22.689 --> 03:42:23.874
that we're coming?

5204
03:42:23.874 --> 03:42:25.195
LIAM: Holy shit.

5205
03:42:25.195 --> 03:42:26.390
SAM: No, let's just go, let's just go.

5206
03:42:26.390 --> 03:42:28.846
MARISHA: As we go through. (whooshing)

5207
03:42:28.846 --> 03:42:31.939
MATT: So you go, and the horses (whooshing),

5208
03:42:31.939 --> 03:42:35.483
now disappearing into the Port Damali circle.

5209
03:42:35.483 --> 03:42:36.840
TALIESIN: More apples go down.

5210
03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:39.848
MATT: Yep, appear through.

5211
03:42:39.848 --> 03:42:42.874
Strange when one of the horses, actually it would be

5212
03:42:42.874 --> 03:42:46.377
probably yours, Nott, relieving itself

5213
03:42:46.377 --> 03:42:49.047
as you're passing through the portal,

5214
03:42:49.047 --> 03:42:53.270
loose horse road apples, through the process

5215
03:42:53.270 --> 03:42:55.788
of teleportation, get kind of-- you remember

5216
03:42:55.788 --> 03:42:57.324
when physics fucks up in Skyrim

5217
03:42:57.324 --> 03:42:58.957
and things get weird and crazy?

5218
03:42:58.957 --> 03:43:02.022
Just like, scatters a bit upon approval.

5219
03:43:02.022 --> 03:43:03.843
ALL: (groaning)

5220
03:43:03.843 --> 03:43:05.851
SAM: Shit spray?
MATT: Shit spray, man.

5221
03:43:05.851 --> 03:43:06.974
Just on one side.

5222
03:43:06.974 --> 03:43:10.142
You all emerge on a similar chamber.

5223
03:43:10.142 --> 03:43:13.307
These designs are different, but the scheme

5224
03:43:13.307 --> 03:43:14.377
is generally the same.

5225
03:43:14.377 --> 03:43:16.200
The doors are made from different materials,

5226
03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:18.517
and you all land in a chamber that has

5227
03:43:18.517 --> 03:43:21.078
the same kind of-- this one does not have

5228
03:43:21.078 --> 03:43:24.327
passage to Vasselheim, but it has the rest.

5229
03:43:24.327 --> 03:43:28.630
The other doors to Zadash, Rexxentrum, and Tal'Dorei.

5230
03:43:28.630 --> 03:43:30.837
SAM: Someone break in. We'll try these doors.

5231
03:43:30.837 --> 03:43:31.934
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go, let's go.

5232
03:43:31.934 --> 03:43:33.617
MATT: To Westruun, specifically.

5233
03:43:33.617 --> 03:43:35.922
TRAVIS: What is the door going to Zadash made of?

5234
03:43:35.922 --> 03:43:38.066
MATT: These also appear to be made of wood,

5235
03:43:38.066 --> 03:43:40.349
but the wood is of a different type.

5236
03:43:40.349 --> 03:43:42.432
TRAVIS: Do you want to pick the lock or should I just

5237
03:43:42.432 --> 03:43:44.151
kick it open with the horse?

5238
03:43:44.151 --> 03:43:46.907
SAM: I can't pick it with a broken tool.

5239
03:43:46.907 --> 03:43:48.066
TRAVIS: Cool.

5240
03:43:48.066 --> 03:43:52.142
I'll ride over to the door, back the horse up,

5241
03:43:52.142 --> 03:43:54.100
and I'm going to smack it on the ass

5242
03:43:54.100 --> 03:43:55.484
and try and get it to kick.

5243
03:43:55.484 --> 03:43:56.743
MATT: All right.

5244
03:43:56.743 --> 03:43:58.243
Roll a d20 for me.

5245
03:44:00.458 --> 03:44:02.333
TRAVIS: Two.
LAURA: Oh god.

5246
03:44:02.333 --> 03:44:03.323
MATT: Crack!

5247
03:44:03.323 --> 03:44:05.765
The door doesn't give.

5248
03:44:05.765 --> 03:44:08.495
The loud echo manages to reverberate

5249
03:44:08.495 --> 03:44:13.329
through the chamber, and you immediately hear (creaking).

5250
03:44:13.329 --> 03:44:14.537
TALIESIN: We're making so many friends.

5251
03:44:14.537 --> 03:44:18.015
MATT: Several footsteps now rushing down the staircase.

5252
03:44:18.015 --> 03:44:20.726
TRAVIS: Can we just Home Alone on this door
and get the fuck outta here please?

5253
03:44:20.726 --> 03:44:22.982
(all talking at once)

5254
03:44:22.982 --> 03:44:25.821
MATT: You do see the Port Damali sigil beneath you,

5255
03:44:25.821 --> 03:44:27.268
so you have that now.

5256
03:44:27.268 --> 03:44:30.022
LIAM: He's busting on the Tal'Dorei door right now?

5257
03:44:30.022 --> 03:44:31.731
LAURA: No, he's just trying to get back.

5258
03:44:31.731 --> 03:44:34.756
TRAVIS: No, we're trying to go back to Zadash.
MARISHA: To Zadash!

5259
03:44:34.756 --> 03:44:36.494
LIAM: You're banging on the Zadash door?

5260
03:44:36.494 --> 03:44:37.379
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

5261
03:44:37.379 --> 03:44:40.032
LAURA: Is it unlocked? Can I just try to--
can I see if it's unlocked?

5262
03:44:40.032 --> 03:44:41.718
MATT: You rush up to try and open the door?

5263
03:44:41.718 --> 03:44:43.412
All right, it is locked.

5264
03:44:43.412 --> 03:44:44.721
SAM: Dammit!

5265
03:44:44.721 --> 03:44:46.570
TRAVIS: Can we start unloading on it now, please?

5266
03:44:46.570 --> 03:44:47.811
SAM: Sure, do you want a bomb, I have a bomb?

5267
03:44:47.811 --> 03:44:50.131
LAURA: No, no, no, we'll just ask if we can go back--

5268
03:44:50.131 --> 03:44:53.672
LIAM: No, you are being crazy.

5269
03:44:53.672 --> 03:44:56.881
Let's just walk out into Port Damali and find a place

5270
03:44:56.881 --> 03:44:58.775
where I can draw on the ground!

5271
03:44:58.775 --> 03:44:59.864
MATT: "Excuse me!"

5272
03:44:59.864 --> 03:45:00.792
(laughter)

5273
03:45:00.792 --> 03:45:02.906
At which point down at the bottom of the staircase

5274
03:45:02.906 --> 03:45:06.639
you see, in familiar Cobalt Soul robes,

5275
03:45:06.639 --> 03:45:09.706
a man in probably his early 60s or so,

5276
03:45:09.706 --> 03:45:12.186
graying hair that's, you know, combed over

5277
03:45:12.186 --> 03:45:16.762
and slicked to one side to cover a major bald spot,

5278
03:45:16.762 --> 03:45:18.821
a heavier mustache that curls down

5279
03:45:18.821 --> 03:45:21.669
to the bottom of the chin, liver spots on his forehead,

5280
03:45:21.669 --> 03:45:24.354
and two armed zhelezo behind him.

5281
03:45:24.354 --> 03:45:26.238
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh my god.

5282
03:45:26.238 --> 03:45:28.726
MATT: "What are you doing?"

5283
03:45:28.726 --> 03:45:30.066
MARISHA: Oh my god!

5284
03:45:30.066 --> 03:45:32.885
TALIESIN: It's a long story. We were just
hoping to leave. This is a long story.

5285
03:45:32.885 --> 03:45:34.455
MATT: One of the Zhelezo is like sitting there

5286
03:45:34.455 --> 03:45:36.211
holding a heavy crossbow at the side,

5287
03:45:36.211 --> 03:45:37.971
pulls out a small horn and goes like--

5288
03:45:37.971 --> 03:45:39.601
(imitates horn blowing)

5289
03:45:39.601 --> 03:45:41.219
MARISHA: (laughs)

5290
03:45:41.219 --> 03:45:42.519
MATT: What are you doing?

5291
03:45:42.519 --> 03:45:43.942
LAURA: This is Archivist Beauregard.

5292
03:45:43.942 --> 03:45:45.500
TRAVIS: Somebody do something really nice

5293
03:45:45.500 --> 03:45:47.183
before I just fucking--
LIAM: I apologize.

5294
03:45:47.183 --> 03:45:50.228
LAURA: Oh wait, yeah, I'm going to Enhance Ability on Caleb.

5295
03:45:50.228 --> 03:45:51.419
LIAM: Greetings.

5296
03:45:51.419 --> 03:45:53.993
MATT: Okay, as you begin to cast the spell--
LAURA: Oh no!

5297
03:45:53.993 --> 03:45:56.160
(laughter)

5298
03:45:56.160 --> 03:45:58.404
Both of the Zhelezo, (whooshes),

5299
03:45:58.404 --> 03:46:01.023
and just fire two heavy crossbows at you.

5300
03:46:01.023 --> 03:46:02.357
(laughter)

5301
03:46:02.357 --> 03:46:03.651
LAURA: Oh my god, my kidney!

5302
03:46:03.651 --> 03:46:04.484
MATT: She's casting!

5303
03:46:04.484 --> 03:46:06.733
LIAM: I immediately start shouting, while they shoot,

5304
03:46:06.733 --> 03:46:10.396
this is a misunderstanding, please, please!

5305
03:46:10.396 --> 03:46:12.518
MATT: A 10 and a 24.

5306
03:46:12.518 --> 03:46:15.311
(laughter)

5307
03:46:15.311 --> 03:46:18.661
TALIESIN: This is a time loop. We're caught in a time loop!

5308
03:46:18.661 --> 03:46:21.221
MATT: You suffer--
MARISHA: Skinned differently.

5309
03:46:21.221 --> 03:46:22.743
MATT: 11 points of piercing damage

5310
03:46:22.743 --> 03:46:26.068
as a second bolt is now on the other side of your abdomen.

5311
03:46:26.068 --> 03:46:27.616
(laughter)

5312
03:46:27.616 --> 03:46:29.584
TALIESIN: This is like spoons that you get at gas stations.

5313
03:46:29.584 --> 03:46:33.761
You're just collecting crossbow bolts across Exandria!

5314
03:46:33.761 --> 03:46:35.533
LIAM: Please, I am so sorry--

5315
03:46:35.533 --> 03:46:37.639
MATT: Both of them immediately drop their heavy crossbow

5316
03:46:37.639 --> 03:46:39.697
for a second and pull out their sword and point it to you

5317
03:46:39.697 --> 03:46:41.280
and they're like, "Not another move!"

5318
03:46:41.280 --> 03:46:42.413
LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

5319
03:46:42.413 --> 03:46:44.467
MATT: "There's no more casting, no spells!"
LAURA: No!

5320
03:46:44.467 --> 03:46:47.855
LIAM: Apologies, this is Expositor Beauregard Lionett.

5321
03:46:47.855 --> 03:46:51.729
I am her arcane assistant, I have only just learned

5322
03:46:51.729 --> 03:46:54.059
to use these circles, and I have brought us

5323
03:46:54.059 --> 03:46:56.690
to the wrong place, and I am so very sorry.

5324
03:46:56.690 --> 03:47:01.377
I would like to take us to our intended destination.

5325
03:47:01.377 --> 03:47:03.709
If you need us to sit here for a while

5326
03:47:03.709 --> 03:47:06.292
while you call the home office, that is a possibility,

5327
03:47:06.292 --> 03:47:08.384
but we could also just walk out the door

5328
03:47:08.384 --> 03:47:10.535
and leave you to your day.

5329
03:47:10.535 --> 03:47:14.556
You see that she knows your ways, she is one of you.

5330
03:47:14.556 --> 03:47:17.124
This is on me. I am so sorry. I am the one

5331
03:47:17.124 --> 03:47:18.657
eating the shit sandwich here.

5332
03:47:18.657 --> 03:47:20.342
We just want to get out of your hair.

5333
03:47:20.342 --> 03:47:22.332
MATT: You hear about three more sets of footsteps

5334
03:47:22.332 --> 03:47:24.681
making their way down the stairs from above.

5335
03:47:24.681 --> 03:47:28.556
The older fellow in the middle goes like,

5336
03:47:30.602 --> 03:47:32.859
looks you both over. Make a persuasion check.

5337
03:47:32.859 --> 03:47:34.367
LAURA: Advantage.

5338
03:47:34.367 --> 03:47:35.674
Wait, I got to--

5339
03:47:35.674 --> 03:47:37.715
MATT: You have to make a concentration check.

5340
03:47:37.715 --> 03:47:38.943
(laughter)

5341
03:47:38.943 --> 03:47:40.624
TALIESIN: Don't you remember from last time?

5342
03:47:40.624 --> 03:47:42.135
(laughter)

5343
03:47:42.135 --> 03:47:43.555
MATT: So hold off.

5344
03:47:43.555 --> 03:47:46.136
LAURA: Okay, okay, oh no, seven.

5345
03:47:46.136 --> 03:47:47.196
No, I didn't get it.

5346
03:47:47.196 --> 03:47:48.029
MATT: You do not have the advantage on this.

5347
03:47:48.029 --> 03:47:48.862
The spell failed.

5348
03:47:50.876 --> 03:47:52.044
LIAM: Pretty good.

5349
03:47:52.044 --> 03:47:53.803
Pretty good, 19.

5350
03:47:53.803 --> 03:47:54.661
MATT: 19?

5351
03:47:54.661 --> 03:47:56.822
TALIESIN: Thank god, finally.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

5352
03:47:56.822 --> 03:47:57.881
TALIESIN: Isn't broken.

5353
03:47:57.881 --> 03:48:00.211
(laughter)

5354
03:48:00.211 --> 03:48:02.258
MATT: As he sits there looking you over,

5355
03:48:02.258 --> 03:48:04.262
and looking over the rest of you, very discerning,

5356
03:48:04.262 --> 03:48:06.414
the other guards come down, immediately

5357
03:48:06.414 --> 03:48:08.304
get their heavy crossbows up, the Zhelezo now,

5358
03:48:08.304 --> 03:48:10.146
there's five of them in the chamber around the one there,

5359
03:48:10.146 --> 03:48:14.654
he goes, "I apologize, but there has been

5360
03:48:14.654 --> 03:48:19.187
"some very terrible things happened within the Cobalt Soul."

5361
03:48:19.187 --> 03:48:20.470
MARISHA: At the Cobalt Soul, at Zadash.

5362
03:48:20.470 --> 03:48:21.845
That's why we're here.

5363
03:48:21.845 --> 03:48:25.230
MATT: "If you would be patient, we have to go check in

5364
03:48:25.230 --> 03:48:26.768
"to confirm your story."

5365
03:48:26.768 --> 03:48:28.265
LAURA: Oh god.

5366
03:48:28.265 --> 03:48:30.907
LIAM: But of course, but of course.

5367
03:48:30.907 --> 03:48:34.287
We will all wait here patiently and quietly.

5368
03:48:34.287 --> 03:48:35.809
MARISHA: Can I come with you?

5369
03:48:35.809 --> 03:48:36.642
MATT: "No."

5370
03:48:36.642 --> 03:48:37.857
SAM: No.
MARISHA: Mm.

5371
03:48:37.857 --> 03:48:40.945
MATT: You wait about another 15 or so minutes.

5372
03:48:40.945 --> 03:48:42.403
TALIESIN: More poop on the ground.

5373
03:48:42.403 --> 03:48:44.185
(laughter)

5374
03:48:44.185 --> 03:48:46.366
TALIESIN: Just leaving poop everywhere.

5375
03:48:46.366 --> 03:48:49.795
MATT: Before eventually he returns and goes,

5376
03:48:49.795 --> 03:48:54.792
"I have just finished talking with the Archive in Zadash."

5377
03:48:54.792 --> 03:48:59.217
(laughter)

5378
03:49:01.191 --> 03:49:04.949
MATT: "We have been told that we are to allow you--"

5379
03:49:04.949 --> 03:49:07.582
(laughter continues)

5380
03:49:07.582 --> 03:49:11.214
"--passage this one time.

5381
03:49:12.425 --> 03:49:16.607
"However, it has been requested that you are also

5382
03:49:16.607 --> 03:49:20.698
"banned from the Archive in Port Damali

5383
03:49:20.698 --> 03:49:21.956
"until further notice."

5384
03:49:21.956 --> 03:49:22.859
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5385
03:49:22.859 --> 03:49:25.989
MATT: "Also, I have a message to Beauregard

5386
03:49:25.989 --> 03:49:28.769
"from Archivist Zeenoth."
MARISHA: Yeah.

5387
03:49:28.769 --> 03:49:33.769
MATT: "He says 'Please, for the love of Ioun, stop.'"

5388
03:49:33.841 --> 03:49:36.960
(laughter)

5389
03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:39.668
LIAM: Caleb, in his mind, is just envisioning

5390
03:49:39.668 --> 03:49:44.594
massive libraries decay and melt into the sea.

5391
03:49:44.594 --> 03:49:46.496
MATT: (laughs)

5392
03:49:46.496 --> 03:49:47.329
MARISHA: Okay.

5393
03:49:47.329 --> 03:49:49.266
MATT: Pulls out his ring of keys, walks over,

5394
03:49:49.266 --> 03:49:52.599
and opens the door to the Zadash portal.

5395
03:49:53.444 --> 03:49:55.887
All the other Zhelezo are like, carefully they picked up

5396
03:49:55.887 --> 03:49:58.652
their crossbows, six heavy crossbows, all cocked and ready

5397
03:49:58.652 --> 03:50:02.100
and they're all aimed at each of you independently.

5398
03:50:02.100 --> 03:50:04.126
The horses all (whinnying).

5399
03:50:04.126 --> 03:50:05.936
LAURA: Single tear down my cheek.

5400
03:50:05.936 --> 03:50:08.978
(laughter)

5401
03:50:08.978 --> 03:50:13.978
MATT: As you all one by one make your way towards Zadash.

5402
03:50:14.191 --> 03:50:17.100
(clopping)

5403
03:50:17.100 --> 03:50:18.982
LIAM: We are really so sorr--

5404
03:50:18.982 --> 03:50:20.482
SAM: To Zada--

5405
03:50:20.482 --> 03:50:22.183
MARISHA: (laughs)

5406
03:50:22.183 --> 03:50:24.627
MATT: Passing through on the other side of this.

5407
03:50:24.627 --> 03:50:26.127
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

5408
03:50:27.045 --> 03:50:31.170
MATT: Awaiting in the center of the chamber is Zeenoth,

5409
03:50:31.170 --> 03:50:35.453
sitting on a stool, head down,

5410
03:50:35.453 --> 03:50:38.587
sweat on his brow and clutching a cloth
that looks to be dampened

5411
03:50:38.587 --> 03:50:42.518
with whatever he's previously been wiping from his face.

5412
03:50:42.518 --> 03:50:46.126
Wipes once more, looks up and goes--

5413
03:50:48.206 --> 03:50:49.464
MARISHA: Sorry.

5414
03:50:51.007 --> 03:50:52.080
Sorry.

5415
03:50:52.080 --> 03:50:53.176
MATT: "Leave."

5416
03:50:53.176 --> 03:50:55.426
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, yep, we're going.

5417
03:50:56.408 --> 03:50:57.241
Goodbye.

5418
03:50:57.241 --> 03:50:58.971
MARISHA: I'm going to go track down these people,

5419
03:50:58.971 --> 03:51:02.746
and then check in with you later.

5420
03:51:05.598 --> 03:51:08.802
MATT: "Please, just go."

5421
03:51:08.802 --> 03:51:10.860
MARISHA: Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

5422
03:51:10.860 --> 03:51:13.027
LAURA: Really sorry about that.

5423
03:51:14.812 --> 03:51:18.304
MATT: He gets up, holds his side,

5424
03:51:18.304 --> 03:51:22.132
unlocks and opens the door to whichever you want to go,

5425
03:51:22.132 --> 03:51:25.449
or are you just casting something here. What do you need?

5426
03:51:25.449 --> 03:51:27.449
LAURA: I'm going to heal myself.

5427
03:51:28.853 --> 03:51:30.820
LIAM: You know, we actually have decided

5428
03:51:30.820 --> 03:51:32.455
just to hang here until--

5429
03:51:32.455 --> 03:51:34.747
(laughter)

5430
03:51:34.747 --> 03:51:35.747
MATT: He goes...

5431
03:51:38.987 --> 03:51:41.219
(laughter)

5432
03:51:41.219 --> 03:51:43.403
SAM: Sometimes you have to go on long journey

5433
03:51:43.403 --> 03:51:46.719
to find out what you really loved was back home.

5434
03:51:46.719 --> 03:51:49.796
LIAM: Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

5435
03:51:50.896 --> 03:51:55.855
(laughter)

5436
03:52:01.312 --> 03:52:02.643
MATT: Oh my god.

5437
03:52:02.643 --> 03:52:03.890
Okay.

5438
03:52:03.890 --> 03:52:06.857
LIAM: So we leave you to your recovery.

5439
03:52:06.857 --> 03:52:08.815
It's mostly my fault, so please don't be

5440
03:52:08.815 --> 03:52:12.148
too hard on Beauregard, mostly my fault.

5441
03:52:13.672 --> 03:52:15.330
MATT: "Just leave."

5442
03:52:15.330 --> 03:52:16.651
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5443
03:52:16.651 --> 03:52:19.389
Look, I know I'm a pain in the ass,

5444
03:52:19.389 --> 03:52:22.753
but I swear, I got good intentions.

5445
03:52:22.753 --> 03:52:25.620
MATT: He leads you back up the stairs,

5446
03:52:25.620 --> 03:52:30.483
back through the middle of the Archive to the front door,

5447
03:52:30.483 --> 03:52:33.662
at which point, where previously you had turned heads,

5448
03:52:33.662 --> 03:52:38.320
you can now see a number of the figures

5449
03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:42.541
are all just in a line, arms crossed,

5450
03:52:42.541 --> 03:52:45.124
just watching you pass through,

5451
03:52:46.433 --> 03:52:50.628
until eventually you exit out into the main thoroughfare

5452
03:52:50.628 --> 03:52:52.545
of Zadash on horseback.

5453
03:52:54.395 --> 03:52:59.395
The doors (impact) slam behind you.

5454
03:52:59.683 --> 03:53:01.824
MARISHA: Well, I consider that a huge success.

5455
03:53:01.824 --> 03:53:03.083
(laughter)

5456
03:53:03.083 --> 03:53:06.366
SAM: You got banned from every Cobalt Soul library--

5457
03:53:06.366 --> 03:53:07.641
LAURA: Until further notice.

5458
03:53:07.641 --> 03:53:09.555
SAM: --in the world.

5459
03:53:09.555 --> 03:53:11.301
MARISHA: Temporarily.

5460
03:53:11.301 --> 03:53:12.504
(laughter)

5461
03:53:12.504 --> 03:53:13.794
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5462
03:53:13.794 --> 03:53:16.299
MARISHA: This isn't the first time
they've like, kicked me out.

5463
03:53:16.299 --> 03:53:18.257
So it's fine.

5464
03:53:18.257 --> 03:53:20.051
LAURA: They're going to be so happy with us

5465
03:53:20.051 --> 03:53:22.745
once we take care of the people that hurt them.

5466
03:53:22.745 --> 03:53:23.781
MARISHA: Exactly.

5467
03:53:23.781 --> 03:53:25.276
LAURA: This was all for them.

5468
03:53:25.276 --> 03:53:26.687
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

5469
03:53:26.687 --> 03:53:31.380
They'll learn that in time.
LAURA: They just don't know it yet.

5470
03:53:31.380 --> 03:53:33.913
TRAVIS: Well, where to now?

5471
03:53:35.909 --> 03:53:37.457
MARISHA: To the Gentleman?

5472
03:53:37.457 --> 03:53:38.540
LAURA: I mean--

5473
03:53:38.540 --> 03:53:40.101
SAM: Are we trying to get to--

5474
03:53:40.101 --> 03:53:43.032
LAURA: I feel like we're in a fucking hurry,

5475
03:53:43.032 --> 03:53:45.011
is the only thing.

5476
03:53:45.011 --> 03:53:47.542
I don't know if we want to take the time.

5477
03:53:47.542 --> 03:53:50.511
And this is hard to say that, because I want to

5478
03:53:50.511 --> 03:53:51.681
talk to him, but--

5479
03:53:51.681 --> 03:53:54.340
SAM: There's no way for us to even get to the Lotusden.

5480
03:53:54.340 --> 03:53:56.084
What is it called, the Lotusden?

5481
03:53:56.084 --> 03:53:57.681
There's no way to get there.

5482
03:53:57.681 --> 03:53:59.798
We can get a thousand miles away.

5483
03:53:59.798 --> 03:54:02.068
LAURA: I feel like I should send at least a message

5484
03:54:02.068 --> 03:54:03.719
to the Bright Queen and let them know

5485
03:54:03.719 --> 03:54:06.851
that they're over there.

5486
03:54:06.851 --> 03:54:10.607
MARISHA: We tried to tell her about
this shit, though, and she seemed--

5487
03:54:10.607 --> 03:54:12.391
LAURA: Like they had a handle on it.

5488
03:54:12.391 --> 03:54:15.982
But I don't know, maybe she doesn't know.

5489
03:54:15.982 --> 03:54:18.751
LIAM: We may be wearing our welcome out with him,

5490
03:54:18.751 --> 03:54:21.281
but it is a threat.

5491
03:54:21.281 --> 03:54:26.275
If you were to contact Essek and tell him what's going on

5492
03:54:26.275 --> 03:54:28.475
and where we need to go, maybe he would be willing

5493
03:54:28.475 --> 03:54:30.644
to give us one more spin.

5494
03:54:30.644 --> 03:54:32.203
SAM: Watch out, there's a cart coming by.

5495
03:54:32.203 --> 03:54:33.721
LIAM: That's our horses.

5496
03:54:33.721 --> 03:54:35.512
(chuckling)

5497
03:54:38.517 --> 03:54:41.129
LIAM: I don't know, I've been trying not to bug the man,

5498
03:54:41.129 --> 03:54:45.205
but I cannot think of a way to get there faster.

5499
03:54:45.205 --> 03:54:47.425
MARISHA: Well, I mean, we've been gone for like,

5500
03:54:47.425 --> 03:54:49.668
two to three weeks now, so.

5501
03:54:49.668 --> 03:54:52.573
LAURA: He probably misses us, if we're going to be honest.

5502
03:54:52.573 --> 03:54:54.892
TRAVIS: We can trade, you know, obviously the information

5503
03:54:54.892 --> 03:54:59.158
we've gathered in exchange for another helping hand.

5504
03:54:59.158 --> 03:55:00.578
LAURA: Yeah.

5505
03:55:00.578 --> 03:55:03.520
LIAM: It's just evidence of our Cobalt cooperation.

5506
03:55:03.520 --> 03:55:04.653
LAURA: Okay.

5507
03:55:05.983 --> 03:55:09.899
Yeah, I'm going to duck into an alleyway

5508
03:55:11.251 --> 03:55:13.967
so I can send a message to Essek.

5509
03:55:13.967 --> 03:55:14.800
MATT: Okay.

5510
03:55:18.008 --> 03:55:19.583
LIAM: I'm going to go find my contact lens.

5511
03:55:19.583 --> 03:55:20.899
LAURA: This is good.

5512
03:55:25.251 --> 03:55:29.020
We found out some really dangerous, important things

5513
03:55:29.020 --> 03:55:31.853
that we need to talk to you about.

5514
03:55:34.342 --> 03:55:38.158
I know you don't want to, but we could really

5515
03:55:38.158 --> 03:55:40.995
use your help with transportation.

5516
03:55:40.995 --> 03:55:45.887
This is life or death for a lot of people.

5517
03:55:48.637 --> 03:55:50.470
It's on your doorstep.

5518
03:55:52.890 --> 03:55:55.057
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

5519
03:55:55.895 --> 03:55:59.024
LAURA: Oh god, I hate rolling tonight!

5520
03:55:59.024 --> 03:56:00.371
(laughter)

5521
03:56:00.371 --> 03:56:02.054
TALIESIN: Use-- well--
LAURA: What?

5522
03:56:02.054 --> 03:56:03.710
TALIESIN: There's the shiny black one.

5523
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:05.870
LAURA: This one?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5524
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:07.775
LAURA: I'm going to blame you if this is bad.

5525
03:56:07.775 --> 03:56:11.091
LIAM: Oh no, not that one.
TALIESIN: That's fair.

5526
03:56:11.091 --> 03:56:12.400
LAURA: (sighs)

5527
03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:14.110
That's fair. I had that coming.

5528
03:56:14.110 --> 03:56:16.603
LAURA: You could've given me Guidance, but you didn't, 10.

5529
03:56:16.603 --> 03:56:17.436
No, 11.

5530
03:56:18.311 --> 03:56:19.144
MATT: 11.

5531
03:56:25.046 --> 03:56:26.104
"Well.

5532
03:56:29.512 --> 03:56:31.095
"If it is indeed this important,

5533
03:56:31.095 --> 03:56:34.401
"then maybe it's something we can discuss.

5534
03:56:36.432 --> 03:56:40.015
"I trust that your interests are forthright.

5535
03:56:43.919 --> 03:56:46.669
"I'll need your help soon anyway."

5536
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:52.747
LAURA: He said he would need our help soon.

5537
03:56:54.479 --> 03:56:57.289
He seemed like he would do it.

5538
03:56:57.289 --> 03:57:00.201
LIAM: Okay, one step at a time.

5539
03:57:00.201 --> 03:57:02.583
MARISHA: Wonder what he needs our help with.

5540
03:57:02.583 --> 03:57:03.833
LAURA: I don't know.

5541
03:57:04.901 --> 03:57:07.545
LIAM: We'll thread that needle when we get to it.

5542
03:57:07.545 --> 03:57:08.795
LAURA: Should we go back?
LIAM: Yes.

5543
03:57:08.795 --> 03:57:10.069
SAM: Right now?
LIAM: Yes.

5544
03:57:10.069 --> 03:57:12.394
LAURA: We just got here.
SAM: We just got to Zadash.

5545
03:57:12.394 --> 03:57:14.807
LAURA: God, we worked for two whole weeks to get here,

5546
03:57:14.807 --> 03:57:18.280
we finally get here, and we're poofing away.

5547
03:57:18.280 --> 03:57:20.462
But we need to, it's important.

5548
03:57:20.462 --> 03:57:22.319
[Background village street noise]
SAM: Watch out, there's a cart coming.

5549
03:57:22.319 --> 03:57:24.340
TALIESIN: I have a thought.

5550
03:57:24.340 --> 03:57:25.999
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Please.

5551
03:57:27.333 --> 03:57:31.977
TALIESIN: Is there such thing as
an unofficial teleportation symbol?

5552
03:57:31.977 --> 03:57:34.335
Like do people who are not--

5553
03:57:35.443 --> 03:57:36.801
I mean like,

5554
03:57:36.801 --> 03:57:39.462
we know sketchy people.

5555
03:57:40.935 --> 03:57:42.979
Is it possible they might have a way

5556
03:57:42.979 --> 03:57:45.861
for us to get back into town when we need to?

5557
03:57:46.869 --> 03:57:51.106
LAURA: Well, I mean, we can just bamf
into the Cobalt Reserve

5558
03:57:51.106 --> 03:57:52.777
if we need to come back here.

5559
03:57:52.777 --> 03:57:54.414
LIAM: Well, that's going to be--

5560
03:57:54.414 --> 03:57:57.240
LAURA: To Zadash, without horses it would be better.

5561
03:57:57.240 --> 03:58:01.082
MARISHA: We'll let them cool off a little bit, I think.

5562
03:58:01.082 --> 03:58:02.555
LIAM: Send them a gift basket.

5563
03:58:02.555 --> 03:58:06.013
MARISHA: I mean, once again, the only place
I would think to look would be the Gentleman.

5564
03:58:06.013 --> 03:58:08.933
I mean, there were other portals and teleportation circles

5565
03:58:08.933 --> 03:58:12.069
that we've seen ruins of that we've destroyed in the past,

5566
03:58:12.069 --> 03:58:13.276
I'm sure.

5567
03:58:13.276 --> 03:58:15.666
LAURA: I feel like the Gentleman has one.

5568
03:58:15.666 --> 03:58:17.775
MARISHA: I wouldn't be surprised.

5569
03:58:17.775 --> 03:58:19.404
SAM: If we're about to see Essek,

5570
03:58:19.404 --> 03:58:22.199
he's probably going to ask how goes the search

5571
03:58:22.199 --> 03:58:25.959
for the thing that we're supposed to be searching for,

5572
03:58:25.959 --> 03:58:28.826
you know, the dodeca?

5573
03:58:28.826 --> 03:58:31.860
We have not done anything towards that.

5574
03:58:31.860 --> 03:58:33.609
LAURA: We can tell him we're really looking,

5575
03:58:33.609 --> 03:58:35.768
but in the meantime, this popped up.

5576
03:58:35.768 --> 03:58:38.557
TRAVIS: He also said there was no urgency for that.

5577
03:58:38.557 --> 03:58:39.486
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5578
03:58:39.486 --> 03:58:41.169
LIAM: Also we are reestablishing our connections

5579
03:58:41.169 --> 03:58:44.510
in the Empire, which is all well and good for our

5580
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:45.826
arrangement with him,

5581
03:58:45.826 --> 03:58:50.560
and they care very much about (chuckles)

5582
03:58:50.560 --> 03:58:54.381
these things crossing over into their Dynasty

5583
03:58:54.381 --> 03:58:56.472
and our world here.

5584
03:58:58.279 --> 03:59:00.279
(sighs)

5585
03:59:01.832 --> 03:59:03.040
Okay.

5586
03:59:03.040 --> 03:59:04.737
Let's find a good place.

5587
03:59:04.737 --> 03:59:06.855
Where are we, in an alley right now?

5588
03:59:06.855 --> 03:59:08.502
I was just changing a contact.

5589
03:59:08.502 --> 03:59:11.517
I mean, I could do it right here, if we want.

5590
03:59:11.517 --> 03:59:14.033
LAURA: Sure, I'll keep an eye out.

5591
03:59:14.033 --> 03:59:18.942
MATT: Okay, so a cluster of six horses outside an alleyway.

5592
03:59:18.942 --> 03:59:21.790
You're blocking the line of sight into the alley,

5593
03:59:21.790 --> 03:59:23.336
is that what you're doing?

5594
03:59:23.336 --> 03:59:24.736
LAURA: Maybe you--

5595
03:59:28.339 --> 03:59:30.430
Stupid. (laughs)

5596
03:59:30.430 --> 03:59:32.561
Is there like a barn we can hide in or something?

5597
03:59:32.561 --> 03:59:33.873
LIAM: Yeah, we could find a place,

5598
03:59:33.873 --> 03:59:35.032
it doesn't have to be right here.

5599
03:59:35.032 --> 03:59:36.042
LAURA: Yeah.

5600
03:59:36.042 --> 03:59:37.402
MATT: Okay.

5601
03:59:37.402 --> 03:59:39.297
It takes you the better part of, let's say,

5602
03:59:39.297 --> 03:59:42.636
half an hour or so, and you find one alley intersection,

5603
03:59:42.636 --> 03:59:46.039
like a T intersection, where there's enough space to do it,

5604
03:59:46.039 --> 03:59:47.735
and there isn't a whole lot of foot traffic.

5605
03:59:47.735 --> 03:59:50.381
You might have to keep guards posted at the edge

5606
03:59:50.381 --> 03:59:52.076
and try and keep people from going down there

5607
03:59:52.076 --> 03:59:55.139
while it's being finished, but it's doable.

5608
03:59:56.014 --> 03:59:58.582
Who's being posted at the three corners?

5609
03:59:58.582 --> 03:59:59.749
LAURA: I'll do one.

5610
04:00:00.776 --> 04:00:01.984
SAM: I will.

5611
04:00:03.357 --> 04:00:04.818
MARISHA: And I'll be at the other.

5612
04:00:04.818 --> 04:00:07.761
MATT: Okay, I would like the three of you to roll
an intimidation check for me.

5613
04:00:07.761 --> 04:00:09.205
MARISHA: Intimidation?
MATT: Correct.

5614
04:00:09.205 --> 04:00:12.359
LAURA: Guidance, I'm guiding me.

5615
04:00:12.359 --> 04:00:14.017
Guide somebody.
TALIESIN: Um--

5616
04:00:18.461 --> 04:00:20.561
MARISHA: Natural 20.

5617
04:00:20.561 --> 04:00:22.453
TALIESIN: Ooh.

5618
04:00:22.453 --> 04:00:24.870
LAURA: Oh, and I'm Guiding myself.

5619
04:00:26.843 --> 04:00:27.676
SAM: Okay.

5620
04:00:29.964 --> 04:00:31.299
LAURA: 10.

5621
04:00:31.299 --> 04:00:34.252
SAM: Eight, minus three, five.

5622
04:00:34.252 --> 04:00:35.636
MATT: (laughing)

5623
04:00:35.636 --> 04:00:36.673
All right.

5624
04:00:36.673 --> 04:00:38.369
As you're working on your circle,

5625
04:00:38.369 --> 04:00:40.626
about seven, eight minutes go through,

5626
04:00:40.626 --> 04:00:42.795
and nobody gets near you, Beauregard.

5627
04:00:42.795 --> 04:00:44.164
You're just sitting there, and anybody

5628
04:00:44.164 --> 04:00:47.948
that makes eye contact with you,
you scowl back and they're just like--

5629
04:00:47.948 --> 04:00:49.914
and keep going without an issue.

5630
04:00:49.914 --> 04:00:52.158
A few people give you some terse looks,

5631
04:00:52.158 --> 04:00:55.100
they seem untrusting of you. They don't go for the alley,

5632
04:00:55.100 --> 04:00:57.359
but you've definitely caught some attention.

5633
04:00:57.359 --> 04:01:00.201
LIAM: It's just one minute.

5634
04:01:00.201 --> 04:01:03.392
MATT: Sorry, one minute, right, for the circle.

5635
04:01:03.392 --> 04:01:04.987
So yeah, then it would have been

5636
04:01:04.987 --> 04:01:07.269
right on the cusp of finishing the spell,

5637
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:09.019
as you're doing that.

5638
04:01:10.412 --> 04:01:13.101
I'd say even with your low roll, you draw attention

5639
04:01:13.101 --> 04:01:17.101
with some of the Righteous Brand and...

5640
04:01:18.918 --> 04:01:23.376
Crownsguard begin to take notice of this tinier,

5641
04:01:23.376 --> 04:01:24.984
goblinoid-type creature

5642
04:01:24.984 --> 04:01:29.162
that seems to be a bit shifty and not quite, you know--

5643
04:01:29.162 --> 04:01:32.430
seems to be very plainly placed to try

5644
04:01:32.430 --> 04:01:35.199
and keep anybody from entering the alley,

5645
04:01:35.199 --> 04:01:38.223
illegal activity being a problem in this city.

5646
04:01:38.223 --> 04:01:40.274
LAURA: But doesn't she look like Veth this whole time?

5647
04:01:40.274 --> 04:01:42.095
You were Veth for eight hours.

5648
04:01:42.095 --> 04:01:43.577
LIAM: Yeah, we're still within eight hours.

5649
04:01:43.577 --> 04:01:46.605
SAM: That's true, that's true, yeah, sure.

5650
04:01:46.605 --> 04:01:49.486
MATT: You were researching for quite a bit of time.

5651
04:01:49.486 --> 04:01:52.655
I would say, okay, I'll allow it, I'll allow it.

5652
04:01:52.655 --> 04:01:55.559
So not a goblin per se, but definitely

5653
04:01:55.559 --> 04:01:59.111
a shifty-looking figure at the edge of the alley

5654
04:01:59.111 --> 04:02:03.888
that they begin to walk towards out of curiosity.

5655
04:02:03.888 --> 04:02:06.369
They're about 40 or 50 feet from you,

5656
04:02:06.369 --> 04:02:10.605
and you can see three Crownsguard and two Righteous Brand

5657
04:02:10.605 --> 04:02:12.837
from two different corners begin to like,

5658
04:02:12.837 --> 04:02:15.504
make eye contact with each other
and begin walking towards you.

5659
04:02:17.538 --> 04:02:20.419
SAM: Oh boy. (laughs)

5660
04:02:20.419 --> 04:02:21.252
Oh boy.

5661
04:02:22.115 --> 04:02:23.499
I got nothing.

5662
04:02:23.499 --> 04:02:24.660
I got nothing.

5663
04:02:24.660 --> 04:02:26.293
TRAVIS: Do we see this happening?

5664
04:02:26.293 --> 04:02:27.824
MATT: Nope.

5665
04:02:27.824 --> 04:02:29.034
LAURA: Nobody else?

5666
04:02:29.034 --> 04:02:30.891
MATT: You guys are all right by where Caleb is

5667
04:02:30.891 --> 04:02:34.216
in the inside of the alley with the horses at the ready.

5668
04:02:37.481 --> 04:02:38.830
SAM: (quietly) Shit.

5669
04:02:40.407 --> 04:02:44.344
I could go invisible, but I feel like they would see that.

5670
04:02:44.344 --> 04:02:46.763
LAURA: Just look like you're going to barf or something.

5671
04:02:46.763 --> 04:02:48.430
SAM: I'm a great actor.

5672
04:02:50.946 --> 04:02:53.171
I will-- (clears throat)

5673
04:02:53.171 --> 04:02:54.854
I look like Veth.

5674
04:02:54.854 --> 04:02:57.904
They just see me being shifty
and they start walking over?

5675
04:02:57.904 --> 04:02:58.931
MATT: Yeah.

5676
04:02:58.931 --> 04:03:00.014
SAM: Boy oh boy.

5677
04:03:01.705 --> 04:03:03.271
I'm going to start--

5678
04:03:03.271 --> 04:03:05.427
I'm going to start crying.

5679
04:03:05.427 --> 04:03:08.422
I'll just start crying, fake crying.

5680
04:03:08.422 --> 04:03:09.255
MATT: Okay.

5681
04:03:10.513 --> 04:03:13.317
You can make a performance or deception check, your choice.

5682
04:03:13.317 --> 04:03:14.879
SAM: Oh boy.

5683
04:03:14.879 --> 04:03:15.712
Terrible.

5684
04:03:16.559 --> 04:03:17.856
Hey!

5685
04:03:17.856 --> 04:03:18.941
12.

5686
04:03:18.941 --> 04:03:20.015
(laughter)

5687
04:03:20.015 --> 04:03:21.224
MATT: 12?

5688
04:03:21.224 --> 04:03:25.052
Okay, the Righteous Brand stop

5689
04:03:25.052 --> 04:03:27.469
and turn back around.

5690
04:03:28.639 --> 04:03:31.545
The Crownsguard continue approaching, just slower,

5691
04:03:31.545 --> 04:03:33.600
and inspecting you over.

5692
04:03:34.892 --> 04:03:38.466
Two of them stop and watch you cry.

5693
04:03:38.466 --> 04:03:39.974
(laughter)

5694
04:03:39.974 --> 04:03:41.307
LAURA: That's so sad.
TALIESIN: What the...?

5695
04:03:42.322 --> 04:03:44.325
LIAM: It's the Empire, man.

5696
04:03:44.325 --> 04:03:49.325
MATT: One of them steps forward and goes, "Are you okay?"

5697
04:03:49.624 --> 04:03:51.881
SAM: No, I'm not okay.

5698
04:03:51.881 --> 04:03:53.315
I lost my dog.

5699
04:03:54.600 --> 04:03:56.708
MATT: "What does the dog look like?"

5700
04:03:56.708 --> 04:03:58.281
SAM: The dog--

5701
04:03:58.281 --> 04:04:00.391
It's like a dog, man!

5702
04:04:00.391 --> 04:04:03.785
It's like a little brown dog.

5703
04:04:03.785 --> 04:04:07.276
Cute, has a little collar with a button on it.

5704
04:04:07.276 --> 04:04:09.245
MATT: "What was it's name?"

5705
04:04:09.245 --> 04:04:10.955
(laughter)

5706
04:04:10.955 --> 04:04:12.305
SAM: Avantika.

5707
04:04:13.408 --> 04:04:15.779
MARISHA: Did you just pick a name? Holy shit.

5708
04:04:15.779 --> 04:04:19.000
MATT: "All right, well, I'll keep an eye out for it.

5709
04:04:19.000 --> 04:04:20.844
"If we see or find--"

5710
04:04:20.844 --> 04:04:22.751
SAM: (wailing) It's all I've got!

5711
04:04:22.751 --> 04:04:24.399
MATT: "Where should we bring the dog to if we find it?"

5712
04:04:24.399 --> 04:04:27.191
SAM: Right to the...

5713
04:04:27.191 --> 04:04:29.441
(laughter)

5714
04:04:32.119 --> 04:04:33.711
TALIESIN: Oh man.

5715
04:04:33.711 --> 04:04:34.583
Oh no.

5716
04:04:34.583 --> 04:04:37.872
SAM: I don't remember where I'm staying!

5717
04:04:37.872 --> 04:04:40.013
To Pumat Sol's!

5718
04:04:40.941 --> 04:04:44.508
He's my friend, the Invulnerable Vagrant.

5719
04:04:44.508 --> 04:04:45.468
MATT: "All right."

5720
04:04:45.468 --> 04:04:46.890
SAM: Yeah, that place.

5721
04:04:46.890 --> 04:04:49.083
MATT: Gives you a look of like,

5722
04:04:49.083 --> 04:04:51.767
"All right, we'll keep an eye."

5723
04:04:52.988 --> 04:04:55.967
He turns around and join the other two,

5724
04:04:55.967 --> 04:04:57.311
occasionally looking over.

5725
04:04:57.311 --> 04:04:59.694
You can tell, like...

5726
04:04:59.694 --> 04:05:01.985
they don't buy all of it.
SAM: Oh, boy.

5727
04:05:01.985 --> 04:05:06.326
MATT: But they're not aggressively
pursuing it at the moment.

5728
04:05:06.326 --> 04:05:09.093
They may go check in with Pumat Sol.

5729
04:05:09.093 --> 04:05:10.465
SAM: Okay.
MATT: (laughing)

5730
04:05:10.465 --> 04:05:12.373
At some point in the future.

5731
04:05:12.373 --> 04:05:14.301
You may have just implicated-- no.

5732
04:05:14.301 --> 04:05:15.278
(laughter)

5733
04:05:15.278 --> 04:05:16.597
SAM: In the dog thief ring?

5734
04:05:16.597 --> 04:05:18.334
TRAVIS: Bring me his head(s).

5735
04:05:18.334 --> 04:05:19.306
MATT: You finish the spell.

5736
04:05:19.306 --> 04:05:20.440
LIAM: Yeah, I'm holding the chalk, there's one line left,

5737
04:05:20.440 --> 04:05:24.070
and I'm looking at the alleyway at Nott going...

5738
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:25.295
(laughter)

5739
04:05:25.295 --> 04:05:27.486
SAM: Are they gone?
Out of eyesight, or are they still--

5740
04:05:27.486 --> 04:05:30.727
MATT: No, they're like, clocking you from a distance.

5741
04:05:30.727 --> 04:05:32.822
They're still watching you cry there, like--

5742
04:05:32.822 --> 04:05:33.894
SAM: Okay.

5743
04:05:33.894 --> 04:05:35.337
MATT: They don't fully believe you.

5744
04:05:35.337 --> 04:05:38.891
SAM: I will drop the form of Veth,

5745
04:05:38.891 --> 04:05:41.339
go like this, and dart over to Caleb.

5746
04:05:41.339 --> 04:05:42.270
(laughter)

5747
04:05:42.270 --> 04:05:44.266
LIAM: I see it, I see it.

5748
04:05:44.266 --> 04:05:46.410
I wait till she's like 10 feet away and I go--

5749
04:05:46.410 --> 04:05:48.176
SAM: Fuck off, cops!

5750
04:05:48.176 --> 04:05:50.036
(laughter)

5751
04:05:50.036 --> 04:05:51.134
LIAM: Everybody in the pool!

5752
04:05:51.134 --> 04:05:52.989
MATT: All right, you all jump back on your horses,

5753
04:05:52.989 --> 04:05:55.379
and they all rush over to the alleyway--

5754
04:05:55.379 --> 04:05:57.238
LIAM: Just pulling mine through.

5755
04:05:57.238 --> 04:06:00.188
MATT: Just in time to see like, two horses go (whooshes)

5756
04:06:00.188 --> 04:06:02.094
and just vanish into the ether.

5757
04:06:02.094 --> 04:06:04.364
Last thing you hear is, "What ze--?"

5758
04:06:04.364 --> 04:06:06.372
That's it.
LAURA: Oh my god.

5759
04:06:06.372 --> 04:06:08.465
TALIESIN: That was so ridiculous.

5760
04:06:08.465 --> 04:06:10.545
MATT: Where are you taking them?
LIAM: Rosohna.

5761
04:06:10.545 --> 04:06:11.458
To Essek.

5762
04:06:11.458 --> 04:06:12.291
MATT: All right.

5763
04:06:12.291 --> 04:06:14.908
MARISHA: We have like, 10 stars on GTA V.

5764
04:06:14.908 --> 04:06:16.221
(laughter)

5765
04:06:16.221 --> 04:06:19.749
We are like, they sent out the choppers, yes.

5766
04:06:19.749 --> 04:06:22.928
LAURA: We are so hidden, those stars are going to go away.

5767
04:06:22.928 --> 04:06:26.693
MATT: As you guys arrive within the subterranean basement

5768
04:06:26.693 --> 04:06:30.883
of the Lucid Bastion in the Dynasty city of Rosohna.

5769
04:06:30.883 --> 04:06:32.141
LIAM: With our horses.

5770
04:06:32.141 --> 04:06:35.611
MATT: We'll go ahead and pick this up next week.
TALIESIN: I cast Guidance-- no.

5771
04:06:35.611 --> 04:06:36.840
(laughter)

5772
04:06:36.840 --> 04:06:37.774
SAM: Oh my god.

5773
04:06:37.774 --> 04:06:39.273
MATT: That spiraled quickly.

5774
04:06:39.273 --> 04:06:42.430
TALIESIN: That was such a bad spiral. (laughing)

5775
04:06:42.430 --> 04:06:43.946
MATT: You got greedy.

5776
04:06:43.946 --> 04:06:45.244
(laughing)

5777
04:06:45.244 --> 04:06:48.048
I mean, you got what you wanted, but at what cost?

5778
04:06:48.048 --> 04:06:49.568
MARISHA: Oh, it's fine.

5779
04:06:49.568 --> 04:06:50.831
LIAM: Just our dignity.

5780
04:06:50.831 --> 04:06:53.471
TALIESIN: Banned from our library, as are your children

5781
04:06:53.471 --> 04:06:55.904
and your children's children, for three months.

5782
04:06:55.904 --> 04:06:59.237
MARISHA: Give me back your library card!

5783
04:07:00.098 --> 04:07:01.450
LAURA: Oh my god.
SAM: Jesus.

5784
04:07:01.450 --> 04:07:04.170
MATT: The missive's going to come in, like, you know,

5785
04:07:04.170 --> 04:07:06.653
"Hereby bequeath the position of expositor to Beauregard,"

5786
04:07:06.653 --> 04:07:11.551
and like, "Oh, this one?" on the "do not serve this person"

5787
04:07:11.551 --> 04:07:13.871
photo on the side of the 7-Eleven.

5788
04:07:13.871 --> 04:07:15.015
(laughter)

5789
04:07:15.015 --> 04:07:17.433
LIAM: It's a Xerox photo of your driver's license.
MATT: Exactly.

5790
04:07:17.433 --> 04:07:19.379
(laughter)

5791
04:07:19.379 --> 04:07:20.230
MATT: All righty.

5792
04:07:20.230 --> 04:07:22.970
TALIESIN: Next they're going to go,
oh, don't Beauregard that or anything.

5793
04:07:22.970 --> 04:07:23.968
MATT: Aww.

5794
04:07:23.968 --> 04:07:26.249
LIAM: You just Beau'd yourself.
TALIESIN: It's just Beau'd.

5795
04:07:26.249 --> 04:07:27.601
(laughter)

5796
04:07:27.601 --> 04:07:28.473
MATT: All righty.

5797
04:07:28.473 --> 04:07:31.716
Cool, we'll pick up this next week.

5798
04:07:31.716 --> 04:07:34.295
Thank you guys for watching the chaos.

5799
04:07:34.295 --> 04:07:35.291
TALIESIN: Oh man.

5800
04:07:35.291 --> 04:07:37.261
MATT: Don't forget, we love you very much,

5801
04:07:37.261 --> 04:07:38.944
and is it Thursday yet?

5802
04:07:38.944 --> 04:07:39.803
Good night.

5803
04:07:39.803 --> 04:07:40.725
(cheering)

5804
04:07:40.725 --> 04:07:44.600
(dramatic music)

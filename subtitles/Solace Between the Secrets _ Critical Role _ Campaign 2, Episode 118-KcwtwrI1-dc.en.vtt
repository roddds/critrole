MATT: Hello everyone, and
welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:03.906
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:05.555
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:09.266
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.900
MATT: Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.420
we do have some quick announcements to get through.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.160
Beginning with the sponsor of tonight's episode:

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.993
Hot Topic.

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:17.746
Sam!
(cheering)

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:20.730
SAM: This episode is brought to you by Hot Topic.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.100
As some of you may remember, earlier this year--

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.120
this year?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.355
What a year.

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:28.755
(laughter)

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:30.580
Earlier this year,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.720
we had our first wave of apparel drop at Hot Topic,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.160
and we are excited to share the second wave.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.710
Now, apparel is fine, it's fine.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.947
But the best part about this Hot Topic gear is

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.580
it's got so many more different uses than just

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.300
wearing it on your body.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.170
You can life hack it!

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.610
And, in fact, I took some of their sample apparel

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.260
at my home and I life hacked it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.840
and showed you what else you can do with it.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.794
Let's roll that video right now.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.229
(cheerful music)

00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:13.109
(yelling)

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.720
(blowing)

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.553
Ow.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.913
Oh.

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:31.216
Hmm. (sniffing)

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.606
Almost.

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:35.689
Uh-huh, yeah.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:38.964
Ah.

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:41.969
Mm.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:45.153
(exhaling)

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:49.067
Oh.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:49.900
Okay.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.150
(groaning)

00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:00.761
(groans)

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.833
(exhales)

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.471
(groaning)

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.433
SAM: It's so easy.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.133
SAM: Comb, and a brush, and a bowl full of...

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:28.966
What?

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:30.317
Hey.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:34.790
Kids?

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.723
SAM: Goodnight, noises everywhere.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.810
The end.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.195
Oh. (kisses)

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:41.503
I love you, big guy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.515
(cheering)

00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:53.198
SAM: What a hilarious and unexpected video.

00:02:53.198 --> 00:02:56.337
LIAM: Yeah. We totally just saw that just now.

00:02:56.337 --> 00:02:58.605
SAM: I wonder what it's going to be like.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.998
Anyway, thanks to my wife who may or may not have shot that.

00:03:03.998 --> 00:03:07.667
But it's not just clothing, we've added more characters.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.558
Nope. We've added-- they'll edit this out.

00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:14.067
We've added more categories beyond some awesome shirts,

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:17.487
like drink wear, a journal, some pins, buttons,

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:20.016
a cool d20 backpack hanger.

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.107
Backpack hanger?

00:03:21.107 --> 00:03:22.617
LAURA: Yeah, you can go ahead and

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:23.662
hold that one up right now.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:25.346
SAM: I have this?
LAURA: Yes, that!

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:26.695
SAM: This is a backpack hanger!
LAURA: Yeah!

00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:29.452
SAM: I was picturing a thing that you hang a backpack on.

00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:31.661
ASHLEY: Me, too. I was like, "That's just a hanger."

00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:32.970
(laughter)

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.220
TRAVIS: You know what TikTok is, Sam.
SAM: Oh boy [Inaudible].

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.127
LIAM: I'm [Inaudible] to the German
in Raiders of the Lost Arc,

00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:39.184
when he comes in going like,

00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:41.389
"Good evening, Fräulein."

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.297
SAM: And Funko Pops!

00:03:44.297 --> 00:03:45.877
We also have two amazing blankets,

00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:48.327
with the beautiful artwork of Critter artists

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.897
Hugo Cardenas and Joseph Ramirez,

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:54.037
and all of this and more is available through Hot Topic,

00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:59.037
so get onto bit.ly/HotTopicCR and check it out.

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:01.569
Laura, we brought some of the stuff with us tonight, right?

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.477
LAURA: Yeah, yes.

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:05.976
You did an amazing job, Sam, talking about all this stuff.

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:08.967
But yes, we do have some stuff to show off tonight!

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:11.662
So Sam, obviously, Sam has that fabulous hoodie.

00:04:11.662 --> 00:04:12.950
SAM: I don't know if you can see that.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.775
LAURA: Hold on, I was going to get to the pin!

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:15.612
SAM: I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Laura!

00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:18.267
LAURA: But it's too fricking late now! Hold up the dang pin!

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:20.127
SAM: Okay, sorry, sorry.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:21.869
LAURA: Oh, what a lovely pin!

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:23.451
And look at your hoodie!

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:24.877
SAM: And it's got a back to it, too.

00:04:24.877 --> 00:04:25.710
TRAVIS: It does.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.585
LAURA: Yeah!

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:27.526
ASHLEY: I love it.

00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:28.359
MARISHA: It's so cool.

00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:29.550
LAURA: I'm a big fan.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.697
LIAM: That is the OG Kit Buss art, the original art.

00:04:33.697 --> 00:04:37.797
LAURA: So we have that. We have this awesome long-sleeved

00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:40.077
Vox Machina shirt that's got all of our character icons

00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:41.357
down the sleeves.

00:04:41.357 --> 00:04:43.719
I'm doing a bad job showing that off.

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.477
We have drink wear! Ooh!

00:04:47.477 --> 00:04:50.137
We have-- you are holding the--

00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:51.221
SAM: Liam O'Brien, available now.

00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:52.362
LAURA: We have Liam O'Brien.

00:04:52.362 --> 00:04:55.025
We have a new Traveler Con t-shirt coming out there.

00:04:55.875 --> 00:05:00.847
We have an awesome-- this is the Hugo artwork for a blanket.

00:05:00.847 --> 00:05:05.130
And then we also have our amazing Yasha blanket, oh yeah.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.684
ASHLEY: Look at this! We got, we got.

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:09.517
TRAVIS: They're so smooshy.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.337
ASHLEY: I can't see and do it at the same time.

00:05:12.337 --> 00:05:14.268
We got Laughing Hand stuff.

00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:15.776
LAURA: That's our--
SAM: Ooh, nice.

00:05:16.764 --> 00:05:17.698
MARISHA: Yes!

00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:19.314
LAURA: So yeah, there's a lot.

00:05:19.314 --> 00:05:20.851
I think that might be everything,

00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:22.587
and you already held up the backpack.

00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:23.420
SAM: I blew it, sorry.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.793
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: This is a backpack hanger.

00:05:24.793 --> 00:05:26.231
LAURA: Yeah!

00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:28.687
And there's other things, yes!

00:05:28.687 --> 00:05:29.678
MARISHA: Mirror dice!

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.685
LAURA: There's a journal.
Oh, wait, I didn't hold up the journal.

00:05:32.685 --> 00:05:34.517
Wait, give me a second.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.472
Oh, there's a Critical Role journal.

00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:39.527
MARISHA: Wait, wait, what are the tabs?

00:05:39.527 --> 00:05:41.344
What are those tabbies?
SAM: Already there?

00:05:41.344 --> 00:05:42.885
LAURA: Yeah, the tabs are going to be included,

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:45.918
so you can open it to, like, you know.

00:05:45.918 --> 00:05:48.266
MARISHA: Why didn't you lead with this?

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:49.727
LAURA: Yeah, oh, yeah, I know,

00:05:49.727 --> 00:05:51.697
I should've had you hold this one up, Marisha.

00:05:51.697 --> 00:05:52.989
MARISHA: I need it.

00:05:54.156 --> 00:05:56.741
LAURA: Yeah, there's awesome stuff coming up.

00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:58.162
Check it out.

00:05:58.162 --> 00:05:59.639
SAM: Hot Topic.
LAURA: Oh, oh, yeah.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.930
TRAVIS: What?
LAURA: Wait, are we going to somebody else

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.686
before I talk about my next thing?

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:04.401
MATT: I don't think so.

00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.526
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to say my next--

00:06:05.526 --> 00:06:07.933
MATT: Go ahead! Laura!

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:09.591
(laughter)

00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:11.306
TRAVIS: We've never done this before!

00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:16.973
LIAM: Boy, think of all the money
this company saves on rehearsal.

00:06:16.973 --> 00:06:21.831
(laughter)

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:25.057
LAURA: So I always talk about merch items

00:06:25.057 --> 00:06:25.890
and everything like that,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.300
but because we do pre-record a lot of these episodes,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.157
it's not always-- I can't give you, like,

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:34.327
the most up to date merch stuff because sometimes

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.907
it's out of stock by the time we actually air.

00:06:36.907 --> 00:06:40.737
So I'm just going to tell you guys to keep checking out

00:06:40.737 --> 00:06:45.027
shop.critrole.com and, hint hint,

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:47.885
we usually post new things every Thursday morning.

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:48.718
(tongue clicks)

00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:50.834
TRAVIS: Yeah, see?

00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:53.127
LAURA: That's not in the announcement,

00:06:53.127 --> 00:06:57.230
and there's a reason that it didn't say to talk like that.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.207
But yes, and we have new stuff coming out to all the shops,

00:07:00.207 --> 00:07:02.107
including, we're going to do a full run

00:07:02.107 --> 00:07:04.617
of all the Vox Machina dice!

00:07:04.617 --> 00:07:05.987
All of the different characters are going to have

00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:08.270
a full dice set, so check in for that.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.761
It should be showing up soon.

00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:11.033
All right, I'm done.

00:07:11.925 --> 00:07:12.925
MATT: And, bail.

00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:15.817
TRAVIS: Before she starts juggling and doing fireworks.

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:18.488
MATT: Oh my goodness. Thank you, Laura.

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:21.716
A well-oiled machine.

00:07:23.717 --> 00:07:25.389
Damn, you have been busy.

00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:29.007
I believe those are all of our announcements.

00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:33.470
So let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of

00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:35.829

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:15.677
SAM: What?
MATT: And welcome back.

00:09:15.677 --> 00:09:18.967
Yes, Sam, we're back.

00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:21.045
So last we left off:

00:09:21.045 --> 00:09:21.878
The Mighty Nein,

00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:24.859
making their way north to Eiselcross--
MARISHA and ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way! ♪

00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:27.117
MATT: ♪ Making my ♪
What's that?

00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:30.167
Wow, this is going to be a good night.

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:32.804
The energy's already all sorts of weird.

00:09:32.804 --> 00:09:33.887
LIAM: Die.

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:38.147
MATT: The Mighty Nein had made their way northward.

00:09:38.147 --> 00:09:40.272
Hired by Vess DeRogna,

00:09:40.272 --> 00:09:42.422
and then she died.

00:09:42.422 --> 00:09:43.816
So.

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.907
TRAVIS: Come on, man!

00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:48.747
MATT: They, however, continued with their guide, Dagen,

00:09:48.747 --> 00:09:52.557
to lead them through the path preset by Vess

00:09:52.557 --> 00:09:55.644
towards the excavation of the ruins of Aeor,

00:09:55.644 --> 00:09:57.257
hitting a couple of the smaller excavations

00:09:57.257 --> 00:09:58.937
along the way.

00:09:58.937 --> 00:10:01.370
Along this path, you met with dangers,

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.827
and some strange encounters with Lucien

00:10:03.827 --> 00:10:05.794
and the rest of the Tomb Takers

00:10:05.794 --> 00:10:07.807
in the A5 excavation site.

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.757
After fighting your way down,

00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:10.721
you caught up to them,

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:12.279
where they had procured a large threshold crest object,

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:16.587
where they had procured a large threshold crest object,

00:10:16.587 --> 00:10:18.572
and after a brief conversation,

00:10:18.572 --> 00:10:20.097
continued their trek northward,

00:10:20.097 --> 00:10:21.677
with an invitation to follow suit

00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:23.790
should you wish to learn more.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.044
You guys then headed back out into the frozen wastes,

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.057
with a couple of choice encounters that involved

00:10:30.057 --> 00:10:31.987
turning dangerous things into turtles

00:10:31.987 --> 00:10:36.277
and really not having it be dangerous at all.

00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:39.567
You continued your trek, and at the end of the second day,

00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:43.047
we left with you transforming three of your party

00:10:43.047 --> 00:10:47.097
into giant eagles, picking up the remainder of your troop,

00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:50.237
and flying best you could for as long as you could

00:10:50.237 --> 00:10:53.667
over the central mountain range that would normally bisect

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:57.697
the paths northward to A2.

00:10:57.697 --> 00:11:01.747
So Mighty Nein,

00:11:01.747 --> 00:11:04.547
as you continue trekking for the continued hour,

00:11:04.547 --> 00:11:06.688
which at full speed,

00:11:06.688 --> 00:11:08.554
I think it's somewhere in the
neighborhood of eight miles an hour,

00:11:08.554 --> 00:11:10.420
but if you go full speed, about 16 miles an hour.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.887
You can get quite a bit of distance as giant eagles,

00:11:12.887 --> 00:11:16.017
and definitely help kick up that lead

00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:18.417
that you're hoping to gain upon the Tomb Takers

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:20.567
and their journey northward.

00:11:20.567 --> 00:11:22.447
So I take it you're going for the entire hour?

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:23.866
Are you going full speed?

00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:27.166
LAURA: I imagine, yes, we will go full speedies.

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:29.967
What is the, like, if you're walking in snow,

00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:32.437
what's your speed you're normally at?

00:11:32.437 --> 00:11:34.827
MATT: Without Dagen taking you along,

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:36.557
it would be half speed.

00:11:36.557 --> 00:11:40.247
But because of his guidance and his knowledge of the space

00:11:40.247 --> 00:11:42.307
and, honestly, digging a groove through

00:11:42.307 --> 00:11:44.887
a lot of the snow and ice himself for you to follow in suit,

00:11:46.162 --> 00:11:48.107
it's pretty easy to get around, comparatively.

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:50.011
LAURA: Okay.

00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:52.931
Okay, yeah, I think we should just full-onskies as--

00:11:52.931 --> 00:11:53.895
LIAM: (squawks)

00:11:53.895 --> 00:11:55.003
LAURA: Oh, come on.

00:11:55.003 --> 00:11:56.803
(laughter)

00:11:56.803 --> 00:11:59.977
I'm going to just follow Caleb and Yasha's lead

00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:01.663
with how fast they go.

00:12:01.663 --> 00:12:03.416
ASHLEY: (squawks)
MATT: Fair enough.

00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:05.507
So a fair amount of distance--

00:12:05.507 --> 00:12:07.049
SAM: We have Dagen with us, right?

00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:08.090
MATT: You do.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.779
Somebody's carrying him.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:12.727
MARISHA: Yasha?
LAURA: Yasha is carrying--

00:12:12.727 --> 00:12:13.985
ASHLEY: I'm carrying--

00:12:13.985 --> 00:12:15.607
MATT: I think it was Caleb, wasn't it?

00:12:15.607 --> 00:12:16.952
MARISHA: It's whatever we said last game.

00:12:16.952 --> 00:12:18.907
LAURA: You are carrying Dagen.

00:12:18.907 --> 00:12:21.237
You're carrying Dagen.
SAM: Awesome.

00:12:21.237 --> 00:12:23.525
LAURA: I'm carrying you and Fjord.

00:12:23.525 --> 00:12:25.457
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: And you're carrying Caduceus and Beau.

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:26.310
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: You got it.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.198
SAM: Great.

00:12:27.198 --> 00:12:28.284
TALIESIN: All right.
ASHLEY: That is...

00:12:28.284 --> 00:12:30.959
MATT: So the journey, for an hour,
going at full speed like this,

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.665
at the end of it, a creature would need to rest,

00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:36.919
at least for an hour or short rest to recover.

00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:38.641
Technically, because Polymorph,

00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:41.887
any exhaustion or damage that the eagle form

00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:44.347
would've sustained goes away with the eagle form.

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:46.557
I don't know if you need to rest after that

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:47.907
at the end of the transformation.

00:12:47.907 --> 00:12:49.957
Depending on how many spell slots you have per day, too,

00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:51.787
you can cover quite a bit of ground,

00:12:51.787 --> 00:12:54.377
which will definitely lessen

00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:55.907
the impact of the random tables,

00:12:55.907 --> 00:12:57.307
but where's the fun in that?

00:12:59.157 --> 00:13:01.057
But nevertheless, by the time you

00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:03.815
finish your first run as eagles

00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:06.017
and push a little bit further into travel,

00:13:06.017 --> 00:13:10.978
the day slowly begins to lose light.

00:13:10.978 --> 00:13:14.603
The gray sky seems to be growing darker,

00:13:14.603 --> 00:13:16.567
not just from the lack of sunlight,

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:21.327
but it seems to be a cold front and a heavy blizzard

00:13:21.327 --> 00:13:23.767
seems to be creeping on the horizon

00:13:23.767 --> 00:13:26.007
from the northeastern direction.

00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:28.497
But as you land, you could continue on for a bit,

00:13:28.497 --> 00:13:30.397
but you're now in the middle of the mountain range,

00:13:30.397 --> 00:13:32.834
so on foot here is going to be a problem,

00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:35.187
based on the journey you guys were taking.

00:13:35.187 --> 00:13:37.297
LIAM: Why would we even bother with that?

00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:38.130
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.902
LIAM: I can continue.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.243
LAURA: If you think it's safe to keep flying.

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.013
Oh no!

00:13:44.013 --> 00:13:45.388
SAM: What?

00:13:45.388 --> 00:13:47.327
LAURA: I can't Polymorph Yasha, too.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.377
I can only do it once a day.

00:13:49.377 --> 00:13:50.368
LIAM: Oh.

00:13:51.926 --> 00:13:53.887
TALIESIN: That still gave us a bit of time,

00:13:53.887 --> 00:13:56.437
and, honestly, if there's going to be a storm hitting,

00:13:56.437 --> 00:14:01.437
we should probably find a safe place even for the tower.

00:14:01.664 --> 00:14:03.890
LAURA: Hunker down for an--

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.247
Is it dark enough that we should take-- Dagen?

00:14:06.247 --> 00:14:09.544
Is it dark enough that we should take cover tonight?

00:14:09.544 --> 00:14:12.150
MATT: "Looking around, we probably got about,

00:14:14.693 --> 00:14:19.197
"40 or 50 or so minutes before it gets real pitch."

00:14:19.197 --> 00:14:20.030
LAURA: Yeah.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.647
LIAM: Well, let's just lay down stakes here.

00:14:22.647 --> 00:14:25.097
TALIESIN: Find a place where we
won't get snowed in in the morning.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:28.237
LAURA: Yeah, and then in the morning we can Polymorph again

00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:30.787
and we can get us out of this mountain range at least,

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:35.127
so that, you know, we can travel on foot.

00:14:35.127 --> 00:14:38.072
LIAM: Can we poke about a bit until we find

00:14:38.072 --> 00:14:39.757
something like a crevasse or something

00:14:39.757 --> 00:14:42.385
sheltered from the elements somewhat?

00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:46.147
MATT: "I think I found something. Follow me."

00:14:46.147 --> 00:14:47.450
LAURA: Good work, Dagen!
SAM: Fast!

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.372
LIAM: Rangers, man.

00:14:49.872 --> 00:14:52.717
MATT: "I've been around here for a while. Follow suit."

00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:53.957
And he goes ahead and leads you down.

00:14:53.957 --> 00:14:55.736
You can see the section where you landed,

00:14:55.736 --> 00:14:58.057
which was part of a smaller valley

00:14:58.057 --> 00:15:01.037
in the more jagged points of this small

00:15:01.037 --> 00:15:03.697
mountain-hill range.

00:15:03.697 --> 00:15:06.267
You can see he leads you into a small outcropping

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:10.257
where there is a probably an eight-foot indentation

00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:11.914
in the stone.

00:15:11.914 --> 00:15:14.157
And based on the smoothing of the ice,

00:15:14.157 --> 00:15:17.377
it looks like something, some element of warmth,

00:15:17.377 --> 00:15:20.617
had made this home temporarily for a while.

00:15:20.617 --> 00:15:22.389
Most of the ice around here
looks rough in the snow up there,

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:27.294
but there is a smooth concave little alcove.

00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:30.177
LIAM: This is perfect.

00:15:31.177 --> 00:15:35.087
Wand gets jammed into the snow and I take a moment

00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:40.087
and before long, the door opens we have our home again.

00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:42.117
LAURA: Yay!
MATT: All right.

00:15:42.117 --> 00:15:44.107
You make your way into the tower,

00:15:44.107 --> 00:15:45.707
prepare yourselves for an evening's rest.

00:15:45.707 --> 00:15:47.977
If there's anything you wish to do before the night's done,

00:15:47.977 --> 00:15:50.947
you can speak up. Otherwise, we'll
move on to the following day.

00:15:50.947 --> 00:15:52.287
LIAM: Yeah.

00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:53.120
MATT: All righty.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.705
So after a night's rest, some fine food,

00:15:57.705 --> 00:16:02.705
some fine not-freezing sleep,

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.440
the morning comes to, you gather your supplies,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.837
and heading back out of the doorway where you entered,

00:16:07.837 --> 00:16:10.777
you find yourself back at the center of this

00:16:10.777 --> 00:16:13.067
mountainous valley, in that same alcove.

00:16:13.067 --> 00:16:15.297
It is freezing cold now, and you can see,

00:16:15.297 --> 00:16:17.067
there's quite a bit of snow has built up overnight.

00:16:17.067 --> 00:16:18.432
There is still snow falling.

00:16:18.432 --> 00:16:19.949
It looks like the heavy part of the blizzard

00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:23.457
did pass over as you guys were resting,

00:16:23.457 --> 00:16:26.407
but as the doorway opens to the exterior of the tower,

00:16:26.407 --> 00:16:29.787
immediately snow tumbles in from the entryway,

00:16:29.787 --> 00:16:32.397
and Dagen has to push his way through

00:16:32.397 --> 00:16:34.617
as you guys are waking up and getting prepared to leave.

00:16:34.617 --> 00:16:37.357
He's like, "Ugh, this might be a problem."

00:16:37.357 --> 00:16:40.167
Goes ahead and sets down his little, like,

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.428
glider metal front bits and pushes through,

00:16:42.428 --> 00:16:44.950
and eventually you guys all manage to exit without an issue.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.957
LAURA: Just throwing snow around the room

00:16:46.957 --> 00:16:48.592
while he's trying to clear it out.

00:16:48.592 --> 00:16:50.092
Just to have as much fun as possible

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:51.637
before it's no longer outside.

00:16:51.637 --> 00:16:53.615
LIAM: Fifty cats come out of the holes in the walls

00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:55.233
and just like, (licking)

00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:57.581
(laughter)

00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:00.326
MATT: One of them gets, like, brain freeze, and is like--

00:17:00.326 --> 00:17:01.774
(chokes)

00:17:01.774 --> 00:17:05.183
(laughter)
LIAM: (poofing)

00:17:05.183 --> 00:17:09.413
TRAVIS: He had one point. (poofing)

00:17:09.413 --> 00:17:12.940
(laughter)
Oh god!

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.770
LIAM: Like those ping pong ball mousetraps.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.603
MATT: Yep!

00:17:16.842 --> 00:17:18.167
LAURA: Oh no!

00:17:18.167 --> 00:17:19.000
MATT: Perfect.

00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:22.167
LIAM: Like twisting bubble wrap.

00:17:23.207 --> 00:17:24.767
MATT: As you guys are all there,

00:17:24.767 --> 00:17:27.927
adjusting to the extremely brisk temperature

00:17:27.927 --> 00:17:30.367
in comparison to where you had slept the night before,

00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:32.457
Dagen spins around and goes,

00:17:32.457 --> 00:17:34.447
"So we're taking to the sky again, right?

00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:37.866
"I'm not leading through all this bullshit?"

00:17:37.866 --> 00:17:39.507
TALIESIN: Point of thought,

00:17:39.507 --> 00:17:41.897
do we want to burn that many spells now,

00:17:41.897 --> 00:17:43.577
or at the end of the day?

00:17:43.577 --> 00:17:47.147
LAURA: Well, unfortunately, it's going to ruin the day

00:17:47.147 --> 00:17:49.479
if we try to get through this mountain.

00:17:49.479 --> 00:17:50.967
LIAM: We want to get off of this peak.

00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:52.800
MATT: "Yeah, what she's saying."

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.353
LAURA: I'll burn the spell. It's okay.

00:17:56.353 --> 00:17:58.211
TRAVIS: We have lots of travel, right?

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.177
MARISHA: What's the weather like?

00:18:01.177 --> 00:18:02.079
TALIESIN: Frightful.

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:06.095
MATT: It's not blizzarding, but it is snowing.

00:18:06.095 --> 00:18:08.327
Not like a gentle snow, it's a heavier snow,

00:18:08.327 --> 00:18:10.277
but it's not storming.

00:18:10.277 --> 00:18:13.893
MARISHA: Okay. All right.

00:18:13.893 --> 00:18:18.022
MATT: "So (wings flapping) eagle time? What're we doing?"

00:18:18.022 --> 00:18:18.947
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:18.947 --> 00:18:19.780
LIAM: (eagle call)
MARISHA: Eagle time!

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.130
MATT: "(excited laughter)"

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.747
He seems to be excited at the prospect.

00:18:24.747 --> 00:18:26.330
TRAVIS: We don't see anything around us, right?

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.387
Do we want to do a sweep of just the general landscape?

00:18:29.387 --> 00:18:30.220
MATT: Sure.
LAURA: I think I

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.227
had it prepared yesterday, so.

00:18:32.227 --> 00:18:34.767
TRAVIS: I'll assist Caduceus with a sweep of the landscape

00:18:34.767 --> 00:18:36.487
to make sure everything's clear.

00:18:36.487 --> 00:18:38.892
TALIESIN: Am I? Okay, yeah, I guess I'm looking.

00:18:38.892 --> 00:18:40.326
(laughter)

00:18:40.326 --> 00:18:41.159
Huh? What?

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:42.759
TRAVIS: As Fjord grabs the scruff of your outfit

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:45.776
and just holds you in a direction.

00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:46.679
TRAVIS: How's it look?

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:47.731
MARISHA: Perception beam.

00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:50.639
MATT: Yeah, it's like the Caduceus hooded lantern.

00:18:52.837 --> 00:18:54.686
Go ahead and make a perception with advantage.

00:18:54.686 --> 00:18:56.544
TALIESIN: With advantage?

00:18:56.544 --> 00:18:58.343
MATT: Yeah, because he's helping you.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:18:58.343 --> 00:18:59.847
MATT: By pushing you in that direction.

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.747
TALIESIN: Now that's nice, 28.

00:19:01.747 --> 00:19:04.570
MATT: 28, okay.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.448
Glancing about,

00:19:06.448 --> 00:19:08.767
and the snowfall does obscure some of your vision,

00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:12.257
especially beyond about a 60 to 70-foot distance,

00:19:12.257 --> 00:19:14.747
you do catch on one of the nearby ridges,

00:19:14.747 --> 00:19:18.037
you glance up and you see like a bit of darker

00:19:18.037 --> 00:19:19.160
black color,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.947
and you focus on it and you see a set of dark eyes.

00:19:21.947 --> 00:19:23.257
TALIESIN: There's something up there.

00:19:23.257 --> 00:19:25.047
MATT: And you glance over and you see it shift

00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:25.880
out of the direction,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.248
and then a little bit over past the next ridge,

00:19:28.248 --> 00:19:30.727
you can see about five or six wolves

00:19:30.727 --> 00:19:33.250
that are all circling.

00:19:34.637 --> 00:19:37.471
TALIESIN: Oh, they're wolves.
They're going to-- they're doing the thing.

00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:38.444
SAM: Werewolves?

00:19:38.444 --> 00:19:39.277
TALIESIN: They're wolves.

00:19:39.277 --> 00:19:40.302
SAM: Oh.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:19:40.302 --> 00:19:41.897
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

00:19:41.897 --> 00:19:43.672
LAURA: Stupid.
TALIESIN: It's so stupid.

00:19:44.607 --> 00:19:47.887
LAURA: Have we already become eagles while they're looking?

00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:48.720
TRAVIS: He did.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.969
MATT: He did.

00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:51.158
LIAM: We're surveying the land from above.

00:19:51.158 --> 00:19:53.210
TALIESIN: We should probably get a move on.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.043
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:19:54.043 --> 00:19:55.709
LAURA: Yeah, we're eagles.
TALIESIN: Now.

00:19:55.709 --> 00:19:57.062
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Whoa!

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.852
MATT: As you grasp the rest of the party,

00:19:58.852 --> 00:20:00.137
in the same arrangement, I assume,

00:20:00.137 --> 00:20:01.947
as the previous day's travel,

00:20:01.947 --> 00:20:04.295
Immediately (wings flapping)

00:20:04.295 --> 00:20:06.943
You all begin to lift up at roughly the same time,

00:20:06.943 --> 00:20:08.415
and as you pull up away, once again,

00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:12.325
you have an incredible now better-lit overall view

00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:13.767
of the treacherous mountainous terrain

00:20:13.767 --> 00:20:15.597
that you plopped down in the middle of.

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:20.586
You can see some scattering elements of trees and pine,

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:21.477
but other than that,

00:20:21.477 --> 00:20:23.237
falling from this height would be terrible,

00:20:23.237 --> 00:20:26.747
because a lot of the rock and exposed ice

00:20:26.747 --> 00:20:29.557
tends to come to a rather jagged point facing upward.

00:20:29.557 --> 00:20:31.657
But you can see, immediately where you were,

00:20:31.657 --> 00:20:33.397
beyond what you can initially see,

00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:37.287
about 14 wolves had begun to circle

00:20:37.287 --> 00:20:38.657
where you had arrived,

00:20:38.657 --> 00:20:40.387
and they all look up as you take off,

00:20:40.387 --> 00:20:41.697
and you imagine their frustration.

00:20:41.697 --> 00:20:44.669
TALIESIN: It's really for the best.

00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:46.987
It wouldn't have gone well for anybody.

00:20:46.987 --> 00:20:48.248
They can understand me.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.556
MATT: They can.
TALIESIN: It makes me really happy.

00:20:49.556 --> 00:20:50.550
MATT: They can.

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:52.657
TALIESIN: The best part.

00:20:52.657 --> 00:20:54.277
MATT: You feel good that at least you've notified them

00:20:54.277 --> 00:20:55.317
that it's no hard feelings.

00:20:55.317 --> 00:20:57.284
TALIESIN: No.

00:20:57.284 --> 00:20:58.117
MATT: But nevertheless,

00:20:58.117 --> 00:21:00.247
pushing on ahead for the next hour of travel,

00:21:00.247 --> 00:21:02.358
that'll get you another 16 miles.

00:21:02.358 --> 00:21:03.487
LAURA: Great.

00:21:03.487 --> 00:21:07.382
LIAM: Were we just at the mountains that are--

00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:10.057
that the Allowak's Sanctuary is at the foot of?

00:21:10.057 --> 00:21:11.482
Is that where we were?
MATT: Allowak's Sanctuary

00:21:11.482 --> 00:21:12.927
is to the west of this mountain range.

00:21:12.927 --> 00:21:13.760
LIAM: Oh, okay.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.657
MATT: And then the lava river is to the east.

00:21:17.657 --> 00:21:19.537
Sorry, it's west for the sanctuary,

00:21:19.537 --> 00:21:21.387
and then east for the river,

00:21:21.387 --> 00:21:22.947
and you either had to choose one path or the other,

00:21:22.947 --> 00:21:25.057
and you guys decided, "No, fuck it, we'll go over."

00:21:25.057 --> 00:21:27.136
So that's what you did.

00:21:27.136 --> 00:21:28.597
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: All right.

00:21:28.597 --> 00:21:32.252
SAM: So we aren't going through yeti village.

00:21:32.252 --> 00:21:33.102
LAURA and MATT: No.

00:21:33.102 --> 00:21:34.897
MATT: You guys are flying in between,

00:21:34.897 --> 00:21:37.033
taking a straight line shot.

00:21:37.033 --> 00:21:39.397
TRAVIS: We're still south of where the flow shift

00:21:39.397 --> 00:21:40.907
would be on the map.

00:21:40.907 --> 00:21:41.847
MATT: Correct, yeah.

00:21:41.847 --> 00:21:44.677
In fact, with the eagles' traveling,

00:21:44.677 --> 00:21:46.121
you're gaining some time on there.

00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:48.927
You wouldn't make it all the way to

00:21:48.927 --> 00:21:49.967
beyond the mountain range,

00:21:49.967 --> 00:21:52.077
but you will make it towards the decline

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:54.861
and the safer region to hike down.

00:21:54.861 --> 00:21:56.509
SAM: Tight tight tight.

00:21:56.509 --> 00:21:58.307
MATT: So early in the day,

00:21:58.307 --> 00:22:02.187
as soon as you sense the spell duration begin to fade,

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:05.387
the eagles all together, one following the other,

00:22:05.387 --> 00:22:07.137
probably following Caleb since you transformed first

00:22:07.137 --> 00:22:08.817
and would sense it before anybody else,

00:22:08.817 --> 00:22:10.827
begin to descend. Exactly.

00:22:10.827 --> 00:22:12.077
And he goes and glances down,

00:22:12.077 --> 00:22:13.916
you hear him shouting over the wind around you.

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.466
Blowing past, he's like,

00:22:16.466 --> 00:22:18.889
"I think right there's probably the safest place!"

00:22:18.889 --> 00:22:20.247
LIAM: (squawks)

00:22:20.247 --> 00:22:22.517
MATT: "You can't see me because you--

00:22:22.517 --> 00:22:23.457
"Let's go down!"

00:22:23.457 --> 00:22:26.067
TALIESIN: That's the safest place, right over there.

00:22:26.067 --> 00:22:26.900
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.529
MATT: "To the right!"
TALIESIN: To the right!

00:22:28.529 --> 00:22:30.201
MATT: "A little to the left!"
TALIESIN: Little to the left!

00:22:30.201 --> 00:22:31.909
MATT: Guiding you verbally as you guys begin

00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:33.184
to make your way down.

00:22:33.184 --> 00:22:34.513
TRAVIS: Like a ship, I love it.

00:22:34.513 --> 00:22:37.597
MATT: Right before the spell duration ends,

00:22:37.597 --> 00:22:41.727
you safely come to rest on a small cliff side

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:43.677
that begins to head into a

00:22:43.677 --> 00:22:47.427
relatively dangerous switchback pathway,

00:22:47.427 --> 00:22:49.287
natural switchback pathway,

00:22:49.287 --> 00:22:53.677
with some gaps, but traversable.

00:22:53.677 --> 00:22:56.157
And as soon as you all land and go back into your forms,

00:22:56.157 --> 00:22:58.007
Dagen's glancing over for a bit

00:22:58.007 --> 00:23:01.264
and is biting the edge of his thumb and goes,

00:23:01.264 --> 00:23:03.587
"I think we could make this work. All right.

00:23:03.587 --> 00:23:05.957
"Keep up," and begins to wheel himself towards the edge

00:23:05.957 --> 00:23:08.407
of the first walkway downward.

00:23:08.407 --> 00:23:09.418
Any preparation you guys want to do

00:23:09.418 --> 00:23:12.366
before beginning to descend this side of the mountain range?

00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:14.340
LAURA: Dagen!
MATT: "What?"

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.543
LAURA: How long would it have taken to walk this far?

00:23:17.543 --> 00:23:20.651
MATT: "This far probably would've
taken an additional day of travel,

00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:21.837
"if not a little more."

00:23:21.837 --> 00:23:23.553
MARISHA: Hell yeah.
LAURA: That's great!

00:23:23.553 --> 00:23:25.250
ASHLEY: It's very good.
TRAVIS: If the map is any indication,

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.775
we're roughly just shy of completing

00:23:27.775 --> 00:23:31.300
a third of our way to A2.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.457
MARISHA: Good work.

00:23:32.457 --> 00:23:36.442
MATT: "Two hours of work and about a day's not too bad.

00:23:36.442 --> 00:23:38.110
"All right, so."

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.997
SAM: How are we getting down the mountain?

00:23:39.997 --> 00:23:42.375
Are we sledding down?

00:23:42.375 --> 00:23:45.287
MATT: "We are-- well, some of you are walking.

00:23:45.287 --> 00:23:47.699
"I'm sledding, and wheeling,

00:23:47.699 --> 00:23:50.037
"and then we'll climb down where it's necessary."

00:23:50.037 --> 00:23:54.327
SAM: Can we make a big sled or something, for all of us?

00:23:54.327 --> 00:23:55.257
MATT: "I mean, you're welcome to.

00:23:55.257 --> 00:23:56.937
"I ain't getting in that shit."

00:23:56.937 --> 00:23:59.042
TRAVIS: There's no, like, trees around here, right?

00:23:59.042 --> 00:24:01.390
SAM: I don't know, we can paint us a sled?

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.819
LAURA: We don't have anything to paint on, Nott!

00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:06.477
MARISHA: Any fauna?

00:24:06.477 --> 00:24:09.290
MATT: There are scattered trees.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.172
It's nowhere near as dense as some of the Empire mountains,

00:24:12.172 --> 00:24:14.267
and you can see a lot of them are finding

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:16.197
nooks and crannies so they're not entirely exposed

00:24:16.197 --> 00:24:18.197
to the elements and the dangers of the blizzard

00:24:18.197 --> 00:24:19.960
that would come through and eventually kill them off.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.807
MARISHA: Are there, any, like, rare cold mountain flowers?

00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:28.790
Growing on a cliff face?
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.717
LIAM: You mean like rocks?

00:24:30.717 --> 00:24:32.706
MARISHA: No, like a flower.

00:24:32.706 --> 00:24:34.262
TALIESIN: Rocks are the flowers of the mountains.

00:24:34.262 --> 00:24:35.879
MARISHA: Like a fucking flower, dude!

00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:37.179
15.

00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:38.654
MATT: 15?

00:24:38.654 --> 00:24:41.597
You wouldn't be able to recall much for this far north.

00:24:43.347 --> 00:24:45.157
MARISHA: I don't see anything.

00:24:45.157 --> 00:24:45.990
MATT: That was just recalling

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.457
if there would be anything up here.

00:24:47.457 --> 00:24:48.290
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.759
MATT: If you want to look specifically for anything,

00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:50.877
make a perception check.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.292
LAURA: Can I guide her?

00:24:53.292 --> 00:24:55.179
I can't guide her, can I? Because I don't know.

00:24:55.179 --> 00:24:57.104
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

00:24:57.104 --> 00:24:58.277
19.

00:24:58.277 --> 00:24:59.947
MATT: 19.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:24:59.947 --> 00:25:01.775
MATT: On this part of the mountain range,

00:25:01.775 --> 00:25:05.737
you don't really see much in the way of gentle fauna.

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:07.487
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Flora or fauna.

00:25:07.487 --> 00:25:09.747
You do see some barer trees.

00:25:09.747 --> 00:25:12.197
You can see some of the taller pines that

00:25:12.197 --> 00:25:14.837
push through the nooks and crannies of this mountainside.

00:25:15.845 --> 00:25:17.817
They are bald in some places where

00:25:17.817 --> 00:25:20.417
heavy blizzard or storms may have stripped elements away,

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:24.076
but nothing in particular of what you're looking for.

00:25:25.434 --> 00:25:28.882
So you're traveling on?

00:25:28.882 --> 00:25:30.632
TRAVIS: I believe so.
SAM: I'm want to make a fucking sled!

00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:33.067
MATT: You want to make a sled?

00:25:33.067 --> 00:25:33.967
TRAVIS: What would we use?

00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:36.210
Do we have any extra, like, cloaks?

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.787
TALIESIN: Is it a sled just for you,
or a sled for everybody?

00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:40.516
LAURA: Here, you want to sit on my shield?

00:25:40.516 --> 00:25:41.349
MARISHA: Yeah, take the shield.

00:25:41.349 --> 00:25:42.565
TALIESIN: That's what shields are for.
MATT: Jester's shield,

00:25:42.565 --> 00:25:44.165
both of their shields are
big enough for you to sled on, if you wanted.

00:25:44.165 --> 00:25:46.011
MARISHA: I think we have an extra one in the bag of holding.

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:47.110
TALIESIN: I might have an extra shield.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.727
TRAVIS: Perfectly good way
to endanger ourselves unnecessarily.

00:25:49.727 --> 00:25:52.447
LAURA: Yeah. You get really fast, believe me.

00:25:52.447 --> 00:25:53.987
TALIESIN: I have an extra shield.

00:25:53.987 --> 00:25:55.319
SAM: All right, I'll take your shield.

00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:56.877
MARISHA: Do it.

00:25:56.877 --> 00:25:57.857
LIAM: He's probably the only one

00:25:57.857 --> 00:25:59.947
who hasn't seen Willow in this room.

00:25:59.947 --> 00:26:01.975
(laughter)

00:26:01.975 --> 00:26:03.714
SAM: I've seen Willow.

00:26:03.714 --> 00:26:04.779
LAURA: You have?
TALIESIN: Have you?

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:07.621
SAM: My kids just watched it a few weeks ago.

00:26:09.603 --> 00:26:12.160
MATT: Best Val Kilmer role ever.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.453
TALIESIN: So here you go.

00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:14.702
SAM: Thank you! Oh, it's heavy.

00:26:14.702 --> 00:26:16.067
TALIESIN: It's a little heavy.

00:26:16.067 --> 00:26:17.417
SAM: All right.

00:26:17.417 --> 00:26:19.077
MATT: So as you take the shield and walk up

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.527
to the edge of the cliff where you saw

00:26:20.527 --> 00:26:22.327
Dagen's already making his way down,

00:26:23.297 --> 00:26:26.455
it's steep and rocky with trees.

00:26:29.113 --> 00:26:29.954
SAM: So it's not like a--

00:26:29.954 --> 00:26:31.785
I was picturing, like, a gentle slope.

00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:34.177
TRAVIS: No, I think it's like a double black diamond.

00:26:34.177 --> 00:26:37.143
You're the asshole that walks up

00:26:37.143 --> 00:26:39.067
with the cooking tray and you're like, "No problem!"

00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:41.617
MATT: Yeah, the Empire kids don't vacation up north here

00:26:41.617 --> 00:26:44.034
to ride down for the holiday.

00:26:45.107 --> 00:26:47.947
There's still, on foot, another, like,

00:26:47.947 --> 00:26:49.863
hour to an hour and a half of travel

00:26:49.863 --> 00:26:52.488
before you reach the base of the mountain.

00:26:52.488 --> 00:26:54.627
ASHLEY: So an hour and a half sled ride?

00:26:54.627 --> 00:26:55.785
SAM: I'll give the shield back.

00:26:55.785 --> 00:26:58.752
MATT: No, it would be like a...

00:26:58.752 --> 00:27:00.417
a four minute sled ride,

00:27:00.417 --> 00:27:03.434
and whatever remains of you when you get to the bottom...

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.623
TRAVIS: Very little to break with.

00:27:06.623 --> 00:27:07.786
But I think you should go.

00:27:07.786 --> 00:27:11.060
TALIESIN: Once we're a safe distance down, it'll be time.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.687
MATT: There will be a moment where you will be able to sled.

00:27:12.687 --> 00:27:13.959
Just I would recommend <i>not</i> doing it now.

00:27:13.959 --> 00:27:14.792
SAM: Okay.

00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:17.307
(laughter)
Forget it, forget it.

00:27:17.307 --> 00:27:18.723
TRAVIS: Now you're making me want to do it.

00:27:18.723 --> 00:27:20.898
LIAM: What if I turn her into a fish first?

00:27:20.898 --> 00:27:22.707
(laughter)

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:24.932
MATT: It's worked before.
MARISHA: I hate you so much. Why me?

00:27:24.932 --> 00:27:26.555
Why is it turned onto me?

00:27:28.098 --> 00:27:33.071
I was, like, 13 in that headshot, man. 14.

00:27:33.071 --> 00:27:34.176
ASHLEY: Where did you find that?

00:27:34.176 --> 00:27:35.101
LIAM: Oh, wow.
SAM: I don't know.

00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:37.805
TRAVIS: Is that before--
MARISHA: I don't even know how old I was.

00:27:37.805 --> 00:27:39.213
LAURA: It's a head shot.

00:27:39.213 --> 00:27:41.460
MARISHA: I still lived in Kentucky.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.099
That was when I was working
for Actors Theatre of Louisville.

00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:45.557
That's how old that shit is.

00:27:45.557 --> 00:27:50.265
TALIESIN: I can still see the unbroken dreams, it's amazing.

00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:53.215
MARISHA: Yeah. See all the hope still in my eyes?

00:27:53.215 --> 00:27:54.109
It's great.

00:27:54.109 --> 00:27:56.509
LIAM: They were forged [inaudible] like Fjord's sword.

00:27:58.377 --> 00:28:00.734
MATT: So traveling down the mountainside.

00:28:00.734 --> 00:28:03.316
TRAVIS: Cautiously behind Dagen.

00:28:03.316 --> 00:28:04.913
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Death Ward on myself

00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:09.913
because I've seen too much in the last couple of episodes.

00:28:10.461 --> 00:28:11.761
I got eight hours.

00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:12.594
MATT: Fair enough.

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:15.162
TALIESIN: No.
MATT: The journey is

00:28:15.162 --> 00:28:16.358
not that treacherous,

00:28:16.358 --> 00:28:18.279
especially thanks to Dagen leading you through.

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:20.485
There are a couple moments in the mountainside

00:28:20.485 --> 00:28:22.397
where a rope has to be affixed,

00:28:22.397 --> 00:28:24.527
and you all lower yourselves down

00:28:24.527 --> 00:28:26.637
before tugging or cutting it off,

00:28:26.637 --> 00:28:28.617
but as you make your way further,

00:28:28.617 --> 00:28:32.557
there is, at the end of the first hour of travel on foot,

00:28:32.557 --> 00:28:35.677
a moment where you, Veth,

00:28:35.677 --> 00:28:39.527
think, dangerously but possibly,

00:28:39.527 --> 00:28:41.247
there is a sleddable hill to the bottom.

00:28:41.247 --> 00:28:43.737
SAM: Oh, we've reached that moment.

00:28:43.737 --> 00:28:44.847
MATT: Yes, you have.

00:28:44.847 --> 00:28:46.990
SAM: Caduceus, Mr. Clay, thank you.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.861
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Ahem.

00:28:48.861 --> 00:28:52.547
Is there one side that's like-- it's a teardrop shape?

00:28:52.547 --> 00:28:54.727
TALIESIN: It's round, but it's got some grooves,

00:28:54.727 --> 00:28:56.584
so it'll move in a direction.

00:28:56.584 --> 00:28:58.077
SAM: All right, all right.

00:28:58.077 --> 00:28:59.622
I'll position it in a...

00:28:59.622 --> 00:29:00.595
ASHLEY: Do you want a push?

00:29:00.595 --> 00:29:01.828
LAURA: Be careful, because when I did it before,

00:29:01.828 --> 00:29:03.628
my shield is circular, too,

00:29:03.628 --> 00:29:06.269
and you tend to spin really easy,

00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:07.457
and then you can get a real good--

00:29:07.457 --> 00:29:08.290
SAM: Okay.
ASHLEY: Here, I'll hold

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.174
the back so you can get on.

00:29:10.174 --> 00:29:12.720
SAM: Maybe I can...

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.677
What do I have, what do I have?

00:29:14.677 --> 00:29:15.695
Let's see here.

00:29:15.695 --> 00:29:16.710
TALIESIN: Oh god, how dumb--

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.471
LIAM: Do you have anything that could act as a rudder?

00:29:18.471 --> 00:29:19.900
SAM: That's what I'm looking for, yeah.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.033
TALIESIN: Oh, this is such a bad idea.

00:29:21.033 --> 00:29:21.914
TRAVIS: Following us.

00:29:21.914 --> 00:29:23.002
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:29:23.002 --> 00:29:24.638
LAURA: What do you want to do?
TALIESIN: How dumb do we want to be?

00:29:24.638 --> 00:29:27.421
SAM: You know what? I have--
LIAM: Pretty dumb.

00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:30.407
SAM: -- Beauregard's wind fan.

00:29:30.407 --> 00:29:32.292
So maybe I could, like,

00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:34.837
like, use it as like a-- like in Florida.

00:29:34.837 --> 00:29:36.384
MARISHA: A rudder?
SAM: Those, those like, those.

00:29:36.384 --> 00:29:37.217
TRAVIS: Wind sails?

00:29:37.217 --> 00:29:40.457
SAM: Those wind-- those swamp boats that have,

00:29:40.457 --> 00:29:42.824
like, the rudder on the back?

00:29:42.824 --> 00:29:44.862
TRAVIS: Oh, those big-ass fans?

00:29:44.862 --> 00:29:47.063
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah, I don't know.

00:29:47.063 --> 00:29:50.127
Like a wind rudder.
MARISHA: Yeah, you could try it.

00:29:50.127 --> 00:29:53.394
MATT: A fan boat? Okay. Sure.

00:29:54.297 --> 00:29:56.707
All right, so you position your fan,

00:29:56.707 --> 00:29:59.187
you get right to the edge and start that slow scoot,

00:29:59.187 --> 00:30:01.017
and right, you get to that fulcrum point

00:30:01.017 --> 00:30:02.184
where it begins to rotate,

00:30:02.184 --> 00:30:04.787
and that voice in the back of your head begins to regret

00:30:04.787 --> 00:30:06.517
everything that led to this moment.

00:30:06.517 --> 00:30:07.350
But it's too late now

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.124
because you begin to tip forward.
LAURA: Right before she takes off,

00:30:09.124 --> 00:30:11.944
I'm going to just pat her on the back and say,

00:30:11.944 --> 00:30:13.446
May the Traveler guide you.

00:30:13.446 --> 00:30:15.727
And I'm going to give her Guidance on the way down.

00:30:15.727 --> 00:30:16.560
MATT: Okay.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.077
LAURA: So one roll, you get.

00:30:18.077 --> 00:30:21.333
MATT: So there's one moment where you're like,

00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:22.587
"You know what, I'm not going to do this."

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:26.220
As you begin to back up, Jester goes (impact) and gives you

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.977
one little shove on the back,

00:30:27.977 --> 00:30:31.767
and you immediately (whooshing).

00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:34.607
Coasting down at an incredible speed.

00:30:34.607 --> 00:30:36.257
The wind had already numbed

00:30:36.257 --> 00:30:38.857
the edge of your nose and ears just traveling down the side,

00:30:38.857 --> 00:30:40.687
but now your whole face is numb,

00:30:40.687 --> 00:30:42.787
your eyes are beginning to water and freeze on the edges,

00:30:42.787 --> 00:30:44.217
you're just like, "Ah! Ah!"

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.842
Making your way down.

00:30:45.842 --> 00:30:46.675
LAURA: ♪ Making your way down! ♪

00:30:46.675 --> 00:30:49.557
MATT: Immediately, it begins to spin to one side,

00:30:49.557 --> 00:30:51.957
and you can see there's a cluster of trees

00:30:51.957 --> 00:30:53.288
heading up your way. What do you do?

00:30:53.288 --> 00:30:55.691
SAM: I'm going to fan left!

00:30:55.691 --> 00:30:57.247
MATT: Fan left! Shh!

00:30:57.247 --> 00:30:58.929
You coast to the side, and as you do,

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:01.104
the snow sprays off the back!

00:31:01.104 --> 00:31:03.117
And suddenly you're given even more force

00:31:03.117 --> 00:31:04.347
than you expected before, and as you do,

00:31:04.347 --> 00:31:07.526
you actually coast off the snow for a second.

00:31:07.526 --> 00:31:08.426
Impact hard!

00:31:08.426 --> 00:31:10.147
(cheering)

00:31:10.147 --> 00:31:13.277
As you do, you're now scooting towards--

00:31:13.277 --> 00:31:17.037
you see a bit of a turn,

00:31:17.037 --> 00:31:19.407
but the speed that you have is setting you in a position

00:31:19.407 --> 00:31:21.257
where you can bank it, maybe,

00:31:21.257 --> 00:31:22.567
but you're not sure what's beyond it.

00:31:22.567 --> 00:31:23.727
You can't really tell how it goes.

00:31:23.727 --> 00:31:24.560
What are you going to do?

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.057
SAM: I'm going to-- wait, so if I continue,

00:31:27.057 --> 00:31:28.617
I'll be sort of flying up and over?

00:31:28.617 --> 00:31:30.117
MATT: To whatever's beyond that.

00:31:30.117 --> 00:31:32.057
SAM: And if I-- could I try to make the turn?

00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:36.941
Okay, I'm going to try to lean hard and fan right.

00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:38.680
Yeah, fan right!
MATT: All right, all right.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.049
Go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me.

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:42.030
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: And you get to add a d4 to that!

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:42.935
MATT: You do.
SAM: Oh, thank god!

00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:44.901
TRAVIS: This would be the way.

00:31:44.901 --> 00:31:46.042
SAM: One, two, six.

00:31:46.042 --> 00:31:48.267
MATT: Well, don't forget, you also can't roll lower than 10.

00:31:48.267 --> 00:31:50.714
SAM: Oh, that's right.

00:31:50.714 --> 00:31:52.707
MATT: Because acrobatics, you do have training.

00:31:52.707 --> 00:31:55.507
SAM: You're totally right, so that's a 22.

00:31:55.507 --> 00:31:59.079
MATT: 22, as you scoot along, you pull the fan to the side,

00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:01.895
and you guys watch as snow just sprays off

00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:03.977
and for a second, you're afraid you lost Nott,

00:32:03.977 --> 00:32:06.685
and then you see the shape of her against the white snow

00:32:06.685 --> 00:32:09.137
now coasting in the opposite direction.

00:32:09.137 --> 00:32:10.279
You turn around and scoot.
SAM: Woo hoo hoo!

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:11.599
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:13.486
TRAVIS: Should we be giving chase at all?

00:32:13.486 --> 00:32:15.287
LAURA: I know, she's going to be down there for a while

00:32:15.287 --> 00:32:16.363
waiting for us.

00:32:16.363 --> 00:32:19.583
LIAM: Let's just see how this plays out, hold on.

00:32:19.583 --> 00:32:20.647
MATT: Turning to the opposite side,

00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:23.822
you can see there's now a cluster of trees in your path,

00:32:23.822 --> 00:32:26.032
and you can try and maneuver through.

00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:29.127
SAM: I'm going to definitely try to maneuver through.

00:32:29.127 --> 00:32:30.447
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make

00:32:30.447 --> 00:32:31.745
three acrobatics checks for me, please.

00:32:31.745 --> 00:32:34.807
SAM: Okay, it says on D&amp;D Beyond, D&amp;D Beyond,

00:32:34.807 --> 00:32:38.867
that there's a little green A next to acrobatics.

00:32:38.867 --> 00:32:41.007
Does that mean I get advantage all the time,

00:32:41.007 --> 00:32:43.047
or what is that? No, that's...

00:32:43.047 --> 00:32:44.697
MATT: A means advantage.
SAM: Okay.

00:32:44.697 --> 00:32:45.616
MATT: Do you have anything that gives you

00:32:45.616 --> 00:32:47.916
advantage on acrobatics normally?

00:32:47.916 --> 00:32:48.877
SAM: I don't know.

00:32:48.877 --> 00:32:51.220
LAURA: Is it a halfling thing?
SAM: It's always there.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.053
MARISHA: Is it a rogue thing?

00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:54.544
SAM: It just says, there's A next to it, always.

00:32:54.544 --> 00:32:55.452
I don't know.
MATT: Well.

00:32:55.452 --> 00:32:56.954
MARISHA: Did you feed into it?

00:32:56.954 --> 00:32:57.977
SAM: Eh, it's fine. We're fine.

00:32:57.977 --> 00:32:59.887
MATT: Until you discover what that is,

00:32:59.887 --> 00:33:01.847
it doesn't apply to this, so.

00:33:01.847 --> 00:33:04.417
SAM: Great. All right, here we go.

00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:05.917
Four acrobatics checks?

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:07.917
MATT: Three.
SAM: Three, okay.

00:33:08.927 --> 00:33:09.777
14.

00:33:09.777 --> 00:33:11.704
MATT: 14.
SAM: 14

00:33:11.704 --> 00:33:12.537
and a one.

00:33:12.537 --> 00:33:14.778
LAURA: (gasps) No, you can't roll lower than a--

00:33:14.778 --> 00:33:15.611
MATT: You can't roll lower than a--

00:33:15.611 --> 00:33:17.630
SAM: For sure. So that becomes a 10.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.297
MATT: A 10.
SAM: Yeah.

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:20.616
MATT: That's a 10 plus your acrobatics.

00:33:20.616 --> 00:33:24.697
SAM: So the 14 is a 24, the 14 is a 24, and the 10 is a 20.

00:33:24.697 --> 00:33:25.530
MATT: There you go.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.082
ASHLEY: Jeez.
LAURA: God, yeah, I mean, what?

00:33:28.082 --> 00:33:30.527
MATT: You are designed for this shit.

00:33:30.527 --> 00:33:31.360
MARISHA: Hit the A.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.772
MATT: Thankfully, your smaller halfling size means

00:33:33.772 --> 00:33:35.947
that you're a little more aerodynamic,

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:40.161
the wind fan helping guide you from behind like a fan boat,

00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:44.247
and you knowing how to adjust your weight and positioning

00:33:44.247 --> 00:33:47.147
as you've been doing that for a good portion of your life

00:33:47.147 --> 00:33:49.657
to be unseen and to not make any sound.

00:33:49.657 --> 00:33:53.317
You lean back and find yourself dodging between trees.

00:33:53.317 --> 00:33:55.432
A couple of them you actually pinball off of.

00:33:55.432 --> 00:33:56.927
Ping, ping.

00:33:56.927 --> 00:33:59.107
Until eventually the trees vanish,

00:33:59.107 --> 00:34:00.437
and all you see is this

00:34:00.437 --> 00:34:02.557
what you think is a gradual decline, you're like,

00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:05.377
"Oh cool," and then you realize it's a fast-approaching

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:06.461
cliff edge.

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:07.294
MARISHA: (gasps)

00:34:07.294 --> 00:34:09.025
SAM: I got to bail.

00:34:09.025 --> 00:34:09.858
Oh no!

00:34:09.858 --> 00:34:12.232
MARISHA: Oh!
MATT: You are in the air.

00:34:12.232 --> 00:34:15.027
(wind whooshing)
(laughter)

00:34:15.027 --> 00:34:16.334
ASHLEY: No.

00:34:16.334 --> 00:34:18.932
MATT: There is about a 50-foot drop.

00:34:18.932 --> 00:34:21.017
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: That's no big deal for you.

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:21.850
SAM: No big deal.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.675
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make

00:34:23.675 --> 00:34:26.050
one more acrobatics check to see if you can land properly.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.682
TRAVIS: Stick that shit, Shaun White, let's go.

00:34:28.682 --> 00:34:30.497
MATT: This is a higher DC, so.

00:34:30.497 --> 00:34:32.567
SAM: By the way, I don't get advantage.

00:34:32.567 --> 00:34:35.977
That's only advantage on escape from being grappled.

00:34:35.977 --> 00:34:37.907
MATT: Gotcha.
TRAVIS: Come on, Lindsey Vonn, Super-G.

00:34:37.907 --> 00:34:38.740
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

00:34:40.509 --> 00:34:41.807
SAM: That's a 10.

00:34:41.807 --> 00:34:43.077
Do I still get your Guidance?

00:34:43.077 --> 00:34:43.910
LAURA: No.

00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:45.644
SAM: Okay. So that's a 20.

00:34:45.644 --> 00:34:48.067
MATT: That's a 20? So.

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:48.900
LAURA: Oh no.

00:34:49.899 --> 00:34:50.961
Oh no.

00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:53.687
MARISHA: I want a Veth-shaped hole in the snow.

00:34:53.687 --> 00:34:55.557
MATT: You watch as, in the middle of the air,

00:34:55.557 --> 00:34:57.637
Veth kicks out the shield a bit,

00:34:57.637 --> 00:34:59.422
trying to pull some of that Yasha

00:34:59.422 --> 00:35:01.487
Skingorger snowboarding action,

00:35:01.487 --> 00:35:04.437
and the shield just fitters out of your grasp.

00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:07.782
SAM: Oh no! It's just me and a fan. I'm going to--

00:35:07.782 --> 00:35:08.716
MATT: Yep.

00:35:08.716 --> 00:35:10.178
SAM: -- fan down, see if I can--

00:35:10.178 --> 00:35:11.220
(laughter)

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.961
MATT: So from the rest of your perspective,

00:35:14.961 --> 00:35:17.427
you know that moment where Wile E. Coyote like plummets

00:35:17.427 --> 00:35:19.266
off the cliff edge and there's just like the cloud?

00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:20.466
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: On impact?

00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:24.722
You just see the snow, you just see a snow ploof go, pff.

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.847
(laughter)

00:35:26.847 --> 00:35:28.847
Thankfully, it's snow where you impact,

00:35:28.847 --> 00:35:30.577
so you don't take any damage,

00:35:30.577 --> 00:35:33.427
but there's a moment where your whole body is just

00:35:33.427 --> 00:35:36.387
locked in ice cold freezing temperature,

00:35:36.387 --> 00:35:41.060
and you scramble up about seven feet of snow

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.750
to get back to a surface, and you survived.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.340
SAM: Hey!
ASHLEY: French pow!

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.797
LAURA: That is so dangerous.

00:35:48.797 --> 00:35:50.618
You could've suffocated in all that snow.

00:35:50.618 --> 00:35:52.284
SAM: Totally.
MATT: Yeah.

00:35:52.284 --> 00:35:54.388
MARISHA: That was awesome!
LIAM: Did we see--

00:35:54.388 --> 00:35:55.435
ASHLEY: Perfect 10!

00:35:55.435 --> 00:35:58.380
LIAM: From our height, we just saw, nyoom, pew.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.452
LAURA: We don't know.
MATT: Yep.

00:35:59.452 --> 00:36:00.637
And a pff.

00:36:00.637 --> 00:36:03.130
LAURA: Okay, so we didn't--
MARISHA: She's fine, right?

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.207
LAURA: We should make sure she's-- we should head down.

00:36:05.207 --> 00:36:06.749
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.
ASHLEY: Should we do the same?

00:36:06.749 --> 00:36:09.451
I don't know, no no no no no.

00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:10.284
MATT: "I'm next!"

00:36:10.284 --> 00:36:12.107
And Dagen goes ahead and wheels himself

00:36:12.107 --> 00:36:15.557
off the edge of the cliff the same way that Veth did,

00:36:15.557 --> 00:36:18.614
with his front attachments that you've seen him use

00:36:18.614 --> 00:36:19.897
for almost the entire journey here,

00:36:19.897 --> 00:36:20.789
especially in the areas where you're going

00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:22.029
down hills and such.

00:36:22.029 --> 00:36:24.357
He is full on ski-sledding down the side of the mountain.

00:36:24.357 --> 00:36:26.157
You hear him yelling, "Woo!"

00:36:26.157 --> 00:36:28.818
As he pulls to one side and

00:36:28.818 --> 00:36:30.137
begins to spray this way,

00:36:30.137 --> 00:36:32.447
pulls to this side, off this way.

00:36:32.447 --> 00:36:34.118
He's old hat, he's come across this place,

00:36:34.118 --> 00:36:36.473
and without issue, you see him make his way down

00:36:36.473 --> 00:36:38.948
the edge of the mountain, up to the point of the cliff

00:36:38.948 --> 00:36:39.781
and (whooshing).

00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:41.177
LAURA: (gasps)

00:36:42.077 --> 00:36:43.477
MATT: Lands it without issue,

00:36:43.477 --> 00:36:45.387
until eventually you see him come to the very base

00:36:45.387 --> 00:36:49.401
and spin around and then turn back and just go, "Woo!"

00:36:49.401 --> 00:36:51.435
You hear the voice echo up the side of the mountain.

00:36:51.435 --> 00:36:53.525
MARISHA: Is Veth okay?

00:36:53.525 --> 00:36:55.309
I shout down to him.

00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:57.177
MATT: "Mostly!"

00:36:57.177 --> 00:36:58.667
MARISHA: Ah, yeah, she's fine.

00:36:58.667 --> 00:37:00.037
LAURA: We're going to set off an avalanche.

00:37:00.037 --> 00:37:01.173
ASHLEY: Do we go?

00:37:02.707 --> 00:37:04.807
MATT: Not yet.
TRAVIS: Ah!

00:37:04.807 --> 00:37:06.601
MARISHA: I'm sure it's possible.

00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:08.907
TRAVIS: Like, rider shout shit.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:08.907 --> 00:37:11.307
ASHLEY: I mean, this is the only way down, right?

00:37:11.307 --> 00:37:12.242
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Is it?

00:37:12.242 --> 00:37:13.550
SAM: Here, I'll just fire off my pistol

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.336
to let you know that I'm okay.

00:37:15.336 --> 00:37:17.635
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll take out Skingorger and get it ready,

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:21.339
like, you know, at the top of a ramp and then go down.

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:22.172
MATT: Go down.

00:37:22.172 --> 00:37:24.627
Following the same path previously carved

00:37:24.627 --> 00:37:27.173
by your two friends makes it a little easier

00:37:27.173 --> 00:37:29.557
because some of the snow's been broken up.

00:37:29.557 --> 00:37:32.587
Go ahead and make, for the purposes of this,

00:37:32.587 --> 00:37:33.941
two acrobatics checks for me.

00:37:33.941 --> 00:37:35.501
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:41.325
Okay, so, that would be--

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:43.717
Wait, did you say acrobatics or athletics?

00:37:43.717 --> 00:37:45.414
MATT: Actually, it'd be one or the other.

00:37:45.414 --> 00:37:47.317
So for you, it'd probably be athletics.

00:37:47.317 --> 00:37:49.317
ASHLEY: Okay, so first one is a 26.

00:37:49.317 --> 00:37:50.150
TALIESIN: Oof.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.047
ASHLEY: Second one is a 24.

00:37:53.047 --> 00:37:54.570
TALIESIN: Ooh!

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.869
MATT: It's like you've been doing this your whole life.

00:37:56.869 --> 00:37:58.887
It was made easier because your friends went beforehand,

00:37:58.887 --> 00:38:01.377
nevertheless, without having to swerve so heavily

00:38:01.377 --> 00:38:03.147
left or right with the wind fan blowing you

00:38:03.147 --> 00:38:04.527
a little bit off course,

00:38:04.527 --> 00:38:07.307
you find the same gentle path, comparatively,

00:38:07.307 --> 00:38:09.747
that Dagen had made his way down with,

00:38:09.747 --> 00:38:12.137
and when you eventually get to that final bit,

00:38:12.137 --> 00:38:15.227
you lift off the cliff, hold in the air,

00:38:15.227 --> 00:38:17.547
and then impact.

00:38:17.547 --> 00:38:20.467
It's soft, but you catch it with the edge of Skingorger,

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:22.177
and then glide the rest of the way down.

00:38:22.177 --> 00:38:26.155
You have now climbed your way out and are like (panting)

00:38:26.155 --> 00:38:29.464
SAM: (sniffing) Oh, there's so much snot!

00:38:29.464 --> 00:38:32.217
MATT: And you watch as Yasha lands about two feet

00:38:32.217 --> 00:38:34.837
in front of you and sprays snow back onto your face.

00:38:34.837 --> 00:38:36.694
ASHLEY: Cover all the snow, you know?

00:38:36.694 --> 00:38:38.292
LAURA: I mean, we've got shields.

00:38:38.292 --> 00:38:39.885
TALIESIN: YOLO, yeah. Going down.

00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:41.863
(laughter)

00:38:41.863 --> 00:38:44.377
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and SAM: "YOLO."

00:38:44.377 --> 00:38:46.079
MATT: Classic Wild Mother adage.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:48.687
(laughter)

00:38:48.687 --> 00:38:51.082
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and--
LAURA: I'm going to try to race him down to the bottom.

00:38:51.082 --> 00:38:52.471
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and--
LAURA: On my shield.

00:38:52.471 --> 00:38:53.601
MATT: So you're both going at the same time?

00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:54.890
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to catamarans, like,

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.333
try and sit on it and use my staff.

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.317
TRAVIS: Do we just start walking?

00:38:57.317 --> 00:38:58.607
MARISHA: Yeah, let's just walk.

00:38:58.607 --> 00:38:59.440
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.424
TALIESIN: Two acrobatics checks?

00:39:02.888 --> 00:39:03.721
MARISHA: Eh.

00:39:03.721 --> 00:39:04.978
MATT: No, for you, it would be three,

00:39:04.978 --> 00:39:06.101
because you haven't done this before.

00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:07.013
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm into it.

00:39:07.013 --> 00:39:08.247
MATT: You've done this once before.

00:39:08.247 --> 00:39:10.126
TALIESIN: And I'm bad at this, this'll be funny.
LAURA: We have, we've sledded,

00:39:10.126 --> 00:39:12.606
we sledded before on our shields.

00:39:12.606 --> 00:39:14.157
MATT: Eh.

00:39:14.157 --> 00:39:17.031
TALIESIN: That one time at the temple?
LAURA: That one time that we did it.

00:39:17.031 --> 00:39:18.427
TALIESIN: And I nearly died.

00:39:18.427 --> 00:39:19.407
LAURA: Yeah, that time.

00:39:19.407 --> 00:39:21.137
TALIESIN: That doesn't count, does it? All right.

00:39:21.137 --> 00:39:23.192
MATT: So first pass for each of you.

00:39:25.267 --> 00:39:26.100
TALIESIN: 14.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.997
LAURA: Ooh! Acrobatics?

00:39:27.997 --> 00:39:29.671
MATT: Yes, or athletics, your choice.

00:39:29.671 --> 00:39:32.687
LAURA: T-t-twelve?

00:39:32.687 --> 00:39:34.297
MARISHA: T-t-t-twelve?

00:39:34.297 --> 00:39:37.227
TALIESIN: I'm going to give myself
some Guidance, just in case.

00:39:37.227 --> 00:39:38.637
MATT: Okay.

00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:39.857
Well, the first pass,

00:39:39.857 --> 00:39:43.507
as you both begin to head down

00:39:43.507 --> 00:39:45.357
with extreme speed and prejudice,

00:39:45.357 --> 00:39:47.296
immediately the wind's (whooshing) past you,

00:39:47.296 --> 00:39:49.332
the bits of light snow that's still falling

00:39:49.332 --> 00:39:51.385
begin pelting you in the face.

00:39:51.385 --> 00:39:52.667
Caduceus, putting your staff out behind

00:39:52.667 --> 00:39:53.717
to use like a rudder,

00:39:53.717 --> 00:39:55.647
you grind past and turn to the left,

00:39:55.647 --> 00:39:58.277
and you narrowly avoid being smashed into

00:39:58.277 --> 00:39:59.935
by Jester, who is unable to turn

00:39:59.935 --> 00:40:02.287
quite as gracefully.
LAURA: (screams)

00:40:02.287 --> 00:40:03.120
TALIESIN: Oh boy!

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.257
MATT: And while you didn't bail from the shield,

00:40:07.257 --> 00:40:08.743
you do have disadvantage on your next check, so.

00:40:08.743 --> 00:40:09.707
LAURA: Oh no!

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:12.177
MATT: Second pass on each of you,
roll another athletics or acrobatics.

00:40:12.177 --> 00:40:13.010
LAURA: Guide me!

00:40:15.517 --> 00:40:16.350
Ooh!

00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:20.019
MATT: Disadvantage, don't forget.
LAURA: I know, I know, I did it,

00:40:20.019 --> 00:40:21.834
it's my advantage roller.

00:40:21.834 --> 00:40:22.897
MATT: Okay.

00:40:22.897 --> 00:40:24.431
LAURA: Ah, ah!
TALIESIN: 14.

00:40:24.431 --> 00:40:26.739
MATT: 14 again.
LAURA: Well, that one's gone. Hold on.

00:40:27.787 --> 00:40:28.620
SAM: Burn it.

00:40:29.587 --> 00:40:31.429
Touched the ground.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:32.777
LAURA: 21.

00:40:32.777 --> 00:40:34.727
MATT: 21, nice, nice.

00:40:34.727 --> 00:40:36.927
So as you begin to spin around the corner

00:40:36.927 --> 00:40:40.347
where you saw Veth bank initially,

00:40:40.347 --> 00:40:44.537
and Yasha use with a little more acumen,

00:40:45.403 --> 00:40:46.647
it doesn't cause much of an issue,

00:40:46.647 --> 00:40:49.777
and you barely scoot, you almost glide off the edge.

00:40:49.777 --> 00:40:50.985
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
MATT: But you manage to

00:40:50.985 --> 00:40:53.277
just barely crest-- which you have just enough of a view

00:40:53.277 --> 00:40:55.567
as you bank off the side to glance over the side,

00:40:55.567 --> 00:40:57.992
and it is a sheer rock cliff on the opposite end.

00:40:57.992 --> 00:40:59.975
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.
MATT: And as you spin by,

00:40:59.975 --> 00:41:01.777
you watch as Jester cuts you off

00:41:01.777 --> 00:41:03.677
and is now about three or four feet ahead of you.

00:41:03.677 --> 00:41:04.510
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: (cackles)

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.193
TALIESIN: Oh no.
TRAVIS: I'm not doing that.

00:41:07.193 --> 00:41:09.727
MARISHA: She's that friend at go karts?

00:41:09.727 --> 00:41:11.646
She's that guy.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:41:11.646 --> 00:41:12.705
ASHLEY: I'm that guy.
SAM: Turbo booster.

00:41:12.705 --> 00:41:13.942
TRAVIS: Yeah, you are.

00:41:13.942 --> 00:41:16.777
LAURA: I throw a banana peel behind me!

00:41:16.777 --> 00:41:18.700
TRAVIS: What happened?

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.289
MATT: So now as the both of you are coming towards

00:41:20.289 --> 00:41:21.530
the cluster of trees,

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:25.407
following Yasha's path and both--

00:41:25.407 --> 00:41:26.857
actually, you both have pretty decent passive perceptions,

00:41:26.857 --> 00:41:28.967
you're able to follow the path that Veth and Yasha

00:41:28.967 --> 00:41:30.467
had previously cut into.

00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:34.787
Probably Yasha's, since being larger and a little more,

00:41:34.787 --> 00:41:36.474
no offense, skilled at this portion of it.

00:41:36.474 --> 00:41:38.246
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:41:38.246 --> 00:41:39.587
MATT: Make one more check for each of you.

00:41:39.587 --> 00:41:40.651
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

00:41:40.651 --> 00:41:42.406
ASHLEY: Come on.

00:41:42.406 --> 00:41:43.538
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:41:43.538 --> 00:41:44.852
LAURA: Oh no.

00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:48.087
Oh, I didn't even guide myself this time.

00:41:48.087 --> 00:41:49.764
MATT: Nope.

00:41:49.764 --> 00:41:51.289
TALIESIN: Seven.
LAURA: 11.

00:41:51.289 --> 00:41:52.130
TALIESIN: Hey!
LAURA: Hey!

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.957
MATT: So the rest of you are
watching as they bank off the side

00:41:54.957 --> 00:41:56.527
and catch up and scoot by on the outside.

00:41:56.527 --> 00:41:57.827
They both go, woo!

00:41:57.827 --> 00:41:59.907
And go into the cluster of trees.

00:41:59.907 --> 00:42:01.132
LAURA: Oh no.

00:42:02.932 --> 00:42:04.853
SAM: Oh no. Our healers.

00:42:04.853 --> 00:42:05.795
MATT: They're not--

00:42:05.795 --> 00:42:06.833
(laughter)

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:08.842
They're not making it out the other side there.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.522
Both of you--
LAURA: Ow!

00:42:14.117 --> 00:42:15.242
SAM: Not funny!

00:42:17.217 --> 00:42:18.357
MATT: Eight points of bludgeoning damage,

00:42:18.357 --> 00:42:19.697
nine points of bludgeoning damage,

00:42:19.697 --> 00:42:23.251
as you watch Caduceus just, wham,

00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:24.373
into the edge of a tree.

00:42:24.373 --> 00:42:26.054
It doesn't catch him full-on,
but it catches him in the shoulder

00:42:26.054 --> 00:42:27.652
and he goes spinning off of his shield,

00:42:27.652 --> 00:42:30.231
and both eventually begin slowly

00:42:31.437 --> 00:42:34.067
haphazardly sliding through the forest.

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:36.037
You laugh for a second, glancing over your shoulder,

00:42:36.037 --> 00:42:38.627
as he totally biffs, and then, whack!

00:42:38.627 --> 00:42:41.547
You hit a smaller tree that sends you flying off the shield,

00:42:41.547 --> 00:42:43.767
ass over teakettle, before (impact) into the snow.

00:42:43.767 --> 00:42:45.977
Your shield lands over on its side,

00:42:45.977 --> 00:42:49.757
and both of you are now
gently gliding side by side through--

00:42:49.757 --> 00:42:50.778
SAM: Like when you fall on a mogul?

00:42:50.778 --> 00:42:53.600
LAURA: As we're prone, I'm just going to high five him.

00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:57.440
MATT: And you slowly make your way towards the cliff now.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.618
LAURA: Oh, oh, stop, stop, stop.
TALIESIN: I'm going to dig in for that.

00:43:00.618 --> 00:43:02.445
LAURA: I'm going to hold onto him as he digs in.

00:43:02.445 --> 00:43:03.537
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: (screaming)

00:43:03.537 --> 00:43:05.377
MATT: Because you guys did lose momentum,

00:43:05.377 --> 00:43:07.357
it's easy enough to stop as you dig in

00:43:07.357 --> 00:43:08.617
and you both come to the edge of the cliff.

00:43:08.617 --> 00:43:11.750
And it's about a 45, 50-foot drop before the next snowbank.

00:43:13.717 --> 00:43:15.957
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up
my shield and I guess we'll just--

00:43:15.957 --> 00:43:16.966
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:43:16.966 --> 00:43:17.999
LAURA: Same.
MATT: Okay.

00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:20.314
LAURA: How do we get down?

00:43:21.897 --> 00:43:23.087
TALIESIN: Maybe we could wait for the others.

00:43:23.087 --> 00:43:24.192
LAURA: Yeah, let's wait.
TALIESIN: Okay, let's just wait.

00:43:24.192 --> 00:43:25.183
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: That's fine.

00:43:25.183 --> 00:43:28.247
TRAVIS: That looked so graceful! Nice job!

00:43:28.247 --> 00:43:29.877
MARISHA: Did you break any bones?

00:43:29.877 --> 00:43:31.687
LAURA: Did I win? I beat him, right?

00:43:31.687 --> 00:43:32.797
I beat Caduceus?

00:43:32.797 --> 00:43:34.224
MARISHA: There's no winner here today.

00:43:34.224 --> 00:43:37.847
(laughter)

00:43:37.847 --> 00:43:39.311
MATT: All right, so the rest of you are walking down?

00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:40.291
TRAVIS: Just trudging down.

00:43:40.291 --> 00:43:42.699
MATT: Okay. So those at the bottom,

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:46.617
you get to wait about 25 or so minutes

00:43:46.617 --> 00:43:48.557
for the rest of the group to catch up, but nevertheless,

00:43:48.557 --> 00:43:50.757
you all gather at the foot of the mountain range

00:43:50.757 --> 00:43:53.957
and you now have a fairly hilly but open,

00:43:53.957 --> 00:43:56.057
less mountainous journey ahead of you

00:43:56.057 --> 00:43:57.647
onwards towards A5.

00:43:57.647 --> 00:43:58.749
LIAM: Before everybody leaves,

00:43:58.749 --> 00:44:01.437
a puffin circles down from the sky.

00:44:01.437 --> 00:44:03.097
(wings flapping)

00:44:03.097 --> 00:44:04.847
And just lands on Fjord's shoulder.

00:44:06.537 --> 00:44:07.370
TRAVIS: A puffin?

00:44:08.457 --> 00:44:10.889
Huh, what is this? What? What is this thing?

00:44:10.889 --> 00:44:12.180
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: Roll initiative.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.447
LAURA: Is it an orange puffin?

00:44:14.447 --> 00:44:16.417
TRAVIS: Is it orange?
LIAM: Just around the beak here.

00:44:16.417 --> 00:44:17.410
LAURA: It's Caleb.

00:44:18.317 --> 00:44:20.277
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

00:44:20.277 --> 00:44:21.207
LIAM: Peck, peck, peck, peck!

00:44:21.207 --> 00:44:24.967
TRAVIS: Ah! Not the ear, please!

00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:26.230
This is odd.

00:44:27.137 --> 00:44:29.267
Can you understand me?

00:44:29.267 --> 00:44:30.100
LIAM: Meh.

00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:33.131
TRAVIS: We're sure it's Caleb, right?

00:44:33.131 --> 00:44:35.882
LAURA: Caleb gets real stupid when he polymorphs.

00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:38.528
TRAVIS: Oh, right.
TALIESIN: Caleb, do you understand him?

00:44:38.528 --> 00:44:39.711
LIAM: Meh meh meh.

00:44:40.633 --> 00:44:41.692
TALIESIN: I take that as a yes.

00:44:41.692 --> 00:44:43.149
TRAVIS: You've got strong feet here.

00:44:43.149 --> 00:44:44.527
I put him up on my hand and I'm like:

00:44:44.527 --> 00:44:47.151
Here's Beau, and I put him on Beau's head.

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:48.806
MARISHA: Oh, why the head?

00:44:48.806 --> 00:44:52.139
LIAM: (blows raspberry)
MARISHA: It gets, ah. Ah!

00:44:53.282 --> 00:44:56.137
TRAVIS: He totally did not just shit on your head.

00:44:56.137 --> 00:44:57.167
TALIESIN: It'll be cold enough in a minute,

00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:58.569
you can just crack it right out.

00:44:58.569 --> 00:45:01.008
MARISHA: Ugh.
LIAM: Yeah, that's true, good point.

00:45:01.008 --> 00:45:02.577
It's the best place for me to shit on your head,

00:45:02.577 --> 00:45:03.618
to be honest.

00:45:05.837 --> 00:45:06.670
MATT: All righty.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.473
MARISHA: A sentence you said to me, Liam O'Brien.

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:12.340
(laughter)

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.723
SAM: If I had a nickel.

00:45:15.253 --> 00:45:16.697
LIAM: You've heard it.

00:45:16.697 --> 00:45:18.297
MATT: Dagen rounds you up.

00:45:18.297 --> 00:45:20.897
"All right, back on the road."

00:45:20.897 --> 00:45:22.717
He leads on forward.

00:45:22.717 --> 00:45:24.567
I need someone to roll for the next day's journey,

00:45:24.567 --> 00:45:25.877
since you are--

00:45:25.877 --> 00:45:28.057
MARISHA: I know, I feel like we
left off somewhere over here.

00:45:28.057 --> 00:45:29.965
TRAVIS: I did the worm, I created the fucking--

00:45:29.965 --> 00:45:32.174
MARISHA: Boulder, parchment, shears. Okay, go, Jester.

00:45:32.174 --> 00:45:34.250
LAURA: I'll use my turn. What am I rolling? A 20?

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.017
MATT: A d20 for me, please.

00:45:36.017 --> 00:45:36.997
ASHLEY: Boulder, parchment, shears,

00:45:36.997 --> 00:45:38.480
but make sure you do it with three people.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.607
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:45:40.899 --> 00:45:42.104
LAURA: 17.

00:45:42.104 --> 00:45:42.937
MATT: 17.

00:45:45.127 --> 00:45:47.167
The weather for this day clears up.

00:45:47.167 --> 00:45:48.547
It seems the storm from the night before

00:45:48.547 --> 00:45:49.957
has blown through.

00:45:49.957 --> 00:45:53.187
There is an actual blue sky above,

00:45:53.187 --> 00:45:55.057
which you think would bring warmth,

00:45:55.057 --> 00:45:57.337
but if anything, it just brings comfort.

00:45:57.337 --> 00:46:01.277
It's still chilly, but you, following Dagen's lead,

00:46:01.277 --> 00:46:05.867
manage to maneuver through this snowy tundra region

00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:08.527
with little patches of trees growing lesser and lesser

00:46:08.527 --> 00:46:10.077
the further north you go,

00:46:10.077 --> 00:46:13.097
and manage to avoid seemingly any other dangerous encounters

00:46:13.097 --> 00:46:14.297
along the way.

00:46:14.297 --> 00:46:17.027
So that's a good journey there. You caught some time.

00:46:17.027 --> 00:46:20.097
You have a little over three days now at this point

00:46:20.097 --> 00:46:23.348
before you make your way to A2.

00:46:23.348 --> 00:46:25.014
MARISHA: Three days.
TRAVIS: Three days out, okay.

00:46:25.014 --> 00:46:27.885
SAM: Is there anyone that we need to check in on?

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.787
Just in the world?

00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:30.957
TALIESIN: Before we go to sleep, too,

00:46:30.957 --> 00:46:32.907
I'm going to cast Locate Creature.

00:46:32.907 --> 00:46:34.195
MARISHA: When can we talk to Avantika?

00:46:34.195 --> 00:46:36.757
LAURA: I mean, we've still got a lot of day left, don't we?

00:46:36.757 --> 00:46:39.457
MATT: Yeah, mm-hmm, well, like, you guys are walking,

00:46:39.457 --> 00:46:41.597
but I'm just going through the events of the day,

00:46:41.597 --> 00:46:43.477
and if there's anything you want to do during the day,

00:46:43.477 --> 00:46:44.367
you can do it, yes.

00:46:44.367 --> 00:46:45.502
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:47.337
MATT: But there were no encounters that found you

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.637
on this part of the trip.

00:46:48.637 --> 00:46:52.067
SAM: We can't talk to Vess yet, again, right?

00:46:52.067 --> 00:46:54.143
MARISHA: It's got to be close, though.

00:46:54.143 --> 00:46:55.984
LAURA: Yeah, I think we're pretty close.

00:46:55.984 --> 00:46:56.817
We had, like--

00:46:56.817 --> 00:47:01.247
MARISHA: I think we only had two days left last game.

00:47:01.247 --> 00:47:03.537
LIAM: Yeah, that's right. We were saying two more days.

00:47:03.537 --> 00:47:05.277
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:05.277 --> 00:47:06.616
LAURA: So maybe one more night,

00:47:06.616 --> 00:47:09.122
and then we'll be able to do it tomorrow.

00:47:09.122 --> 00:47:10.517
SAM: And is there anyone else that we needed,

00:47:10.517 --> 00:47:12.507
that we wanted to check in on, or?

00:47:12.507 --> 00:47:14.988
LAURA: I mean, I talked to Essek.

00:47:15.955 --> 00:47:20.955
I could send a message to the Plank King for you, Fjord.

00:47:21.057 --> 00:47:22.808
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:47:22.808 --> 00:47:24.199
No, no, no, no, no.

00:47:24.199 --> 00:47:26.822
LAURA: Just to see if he'll let us back on Darktow.

00:47:26.822 --> 00:47:28.366
TRAVIS: I think if we go back to Darktow,

00:47:28.366 --> 00:47:31.545
we're going to do it in a clandestine fashion.

00:47:31.545 --> 00:47:32.607
Better not to, you know,

00:47:32.607 --> 00:47:34.529
tip him off that we're even thinking about it.

00:47:34.529 --> 00:47:35.540
LAURA: Got it.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.837
SAM: Are we being scryed on right now, by the way?

00:47:37.837 --> 00:47:38.767
TRAVIS: Oh, good question.

00:47:38.767 --> 00:47:42.207
I'll summon the sword and say: Galas-var.

00:47:42.207 --> 00:47:45.337
And See Invisibility.

00:47:45.337 --> 00:47:48.115
MATT: All right. Make a perception check.

00:47:51.147 --> 00:47:53.901
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:47:53.901 --> 00:47:55.347
22.

00:47:55.347 --> 00:47:57.557
MATT: Feeling fairly confident in the scan around you,

00:47:57.557 --> 00:48:02.557
you do not see any signs of a peeking beacon or arcane eye

00:48:02.767 --> 00:48:04.904
looking upon you or the troupe around you.

00:48:05.837 --> 00:48:06.670
TRAVIS: Seems clear.

00:48:07.607 --> 00:48:11.339
LAURA: How strong of a radius does this necklace have?

00:48:11.339 --> 00:48:14.525
LIAM: Oh! How long have you had that on?

00:48:14.525 --> 00:48:16.887
LAURA: Fjord gave it to me because apparently, you know,

00:48:16.887 --> 00:48:19.528
Molly had been, I mean--

00:48:19.528 --> 00:48:22.736
Lucien had been scrying on...

00:48:23.697 --> 00:48:26.077
LIAM: It's your person and everything on you.

00:48:26.077 --> 00:48:27.997
LAURA: It's not like if everybody within

00:48:27.997 --> 00:48:30.064
five feet of me or something?

00:48:30.064 --> 00:48:33.067
LIAM: It seemed to have somewhat of an effect on

00:48:33.067 --> 00:48:36.507
my general vicinity a few times in the past, it felt like.

00:48:36.507 --> 00:48:37.340
LAURA: Okay.

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.037
LIAM: It's a little hazy.

00:48:40.037 --> 00:48:42.677
LAURA: So everybody just stay really close to me.

00:48:42.677 --> 00:48:45.317
SAM: Speaking of your person and everything on it,

00:48:45.317 --> 00:48:46.507
I think when you sledded,

00:48:46.507 --> 00:48:49.317
you might have dropped your weasel friend.

00:48:49.317 --> 00:48:50.767
LAURA: No, no, no, no, he's right here.

00:48:50.767 --> 00:48:52.689
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: He was just hiding in my hood.

00:48:52.689 --> 00:48:54.970
SAM: Oh, okay.
TRAVIS: He absorbed most of the impact from the tree.

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:56.501
(laughter)

00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:58.216
TRAVIS: (chokes)

00:48:58.216 --> 00:49:00.027
MATT: You would know, Caleb.

00:49:00.027 --> 00:49:00.860
TRAVIS: One of his eyes is--

00:49:01.828 --> 00:49:05.387
MATT: The device, it protects the wearer

00:49:05.387 --> 00:49:07.777
from directly focused divination.

00:49:07.777 --> 00:49:09.237
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:49:09.237 --> 00:49:10.722
MATT: So if somebody were to want to say, like,

00:49:10.722 --> 00:49:13.237
I want to scry on Caleb, it would prevent that.

00:49:13.237 --> 00:49:17.247
LIAM: That I know, just in our story early days,

00:49:17.247 --> 00:49:19.727
there was some scrying on us and I asked

00:49:19.727 --> 00:49:22.687
if I could wave it into a similar scrying ball

00:49:22.687 --> 00:49:24.647
which made it go away, so.

00:49:24.647 --> 00:49:26.496
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: I thought it had a little bit of wiggle.

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.677
MATT: A little bit of wiggle,
but it depends on the nature of it.

00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:29.510
LIAM: Yeah.

00:49:31.051 --> 00:49:32.125
Person-specific.

00:49:32.125 --> 00:49:33.997
MATT: Yeah.

00:49:33.997 --> 00:49:35.084
All right, so.

00:49:36.187 --> 00:49:37.969
Anything else anyone wants to do?

00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:40.240
LAURA: Anybody? Do we want to talk to anybody?

00:49:41.607 --> 00:49:42.975
MARISHA: Do you want to talk to Yeza and Luc?

00:49:42.975 --> 00:49:45.927
SAM: Yeah, if we have spells to burn,

00:49:45.927 --> 00:49:49.260
just say, you know,

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.837
wife's okay, still alive.

00:49:51.837 --> 00:49:53.868
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send a message to Yeza.

00:49:53.868 --> 00:49:55.391
MATT: Okay.

00:49:55.391 --> 00:49:58.858
LAURA: Yeza! Everything's fine, Veth's okay.

00:49:58.858 --> 00:50:00.727
She loves you so much.

00:50:00.727 --> 00:50:03.056
How are you guys? How's Luc?

00:50:03.056 --> 00:50:04.657
It's cold here!

00:50:06.547 --> 00:50:08.917
She loves you! Did I already say that?

00:50:08.917 --> 00:50:10.610
SAM: Yeah, that's okay, could be more than once.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.470
MATT: Yeza responds.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.527
"Oh, uh, hi! That's great, thanks for the update.

00:50:15.527 --> 00:50:16.768
"We're good.

00:50:16.768 --> 00:50:19.647
"I think Luc has a crush.

00:50:19.647 --> 00:50:23.727
"Um, but everything's good!"

00:50:23.727 --> 00:50:24.560
SAM: Kill her.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.692
MARISHA and MATT: (laughs)

00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:30.588
LAURA: Who would, he's so young!

00:50:30.588 --> 00:50:32.547
SAM: What does that mean?

00:50:32.547 --> 00:50:34.362
MARISHA: Wait, how old is he, actually?

00:50:34.362 --> 00:50:35.960
SAM: It's unclear!

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.437
(laughter)

00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:43.655
I thought three, but now I'm thinking closer to 13!

00:50:43.655 --> 00:50:44.488
(laughter)

00:50:44.488 --> 00:50:46.687
MATT: Not quite, not quite.

00:50:46.687 --> 00:50:48.267
LAURA: Like five now?

00:50:48.267 --> 00:50:50.202
LIAM: A five year old can take a shine to somebody.

00:50:50.202 --> 00:50:51.043
SAM: You know what, Beau?

00:50:51.043 --> 00:50:55.676
The halfling aging process is a mystery to all.

00:50:55.676 --> 00:51:00.407
MARISHA: I remember being, you know, infatuated with people,

00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:02.472
at like six, seven years old.

00:51:02.472 --> 00:51:05.407
SAM: Who were you infatuated with as a six year old?

00:51:05.407 --> 00:51:09.167
Did you have, like, you're from a fancy wine family, right?

00:51:09.167 --> 00:51:10.000
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.007
SAM: Did you have tutors and stuff,

00:51:12.007 --> 00:51:14.097
or did you, like, how did you learn?

00:51:14.097 --> 00:51:16.887
MARISHA: I went to, like, a fancy private school,

00:51:16.887 --> 00:51:20.307
that no one really liked me much because I came from

00:51:20.307 --> 00:51:23.150
the rich family of the town, so.

00:51:24.157 --> 00:51:27.337
Yeah, a little ostracized there. It was weird.

00:51:27.337 --> 00:51:29.407
SAM: So then who did you fancy?

00:51:29.407 --> 00:51:31.287
Who did you make googly eyes at?

00:51:31.287 --> 00:51:34.967
MARISHA: You know, it's funny,
I remember this chef that we had,

00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:37.079
back when I was-- like, a personal chef.

00:51:37.079 --> 00:51:39.087
We would hire her sometimes, you know,

00:51:39.087 --> 00:51:40.537
whenever we would have parties.

00:51:40.537 --> 00:51:43.027
Not all the time, but you know, fancy events.

00:51:43.027 --> 00:51:44.967
And she was always just really kind to me,

00:51:44.967 --> 00:51:46.902
but she was always just like,

00:51:46.902 --> 00:51:49.173
she was super cool,

00:51:49.173 --> 00:51:51.587
and she would bring me,

00:51:51.587 --> 00:51:53.923
like, sneak me treats sometimes, you know?

00:51:53.923 --> 00:51:55.443
She would always like stash aside

00:51:55.443 --> 00:51:58.131
some dessert and like extra bread and stuff

00:51:58.131 --> 00:51:59.995
and the end of the day and like slip it to me,

00:51:59.995 --> 00:52:01.577
and then when I started getting older,

00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:04.597
she would slip me some, like, little slips of wine,

00:52:04.597 --> 00:52:07.987
but be like, don't, you know, "Don't tell your parents."

00:52:07.987 --> 00:52:09.447
She was just the coolest,

00:52:09.447 --> 00:52:12.777
and I didn't really know until I was older

00:52:12.777 --> 00:52:15.007
what those feelings were.

00:52:15.007 --> 00:52:15.840
SAM: Wow.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.482
MARISHA: Yeah. Looking back, though.

00:52:18.482 --> 00:52:20.410
She probably should've been a sign.

00:52:21.514 --> 00:52:22.434
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:52:22.434 --> 00:52:23.674
SAM: Assigned to you.

00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:26.804
MARISHA: Yeah, I probably wouldn't have, like, you know,

00:52:26.804 --> 00:52:30.604
had that first boyfriend if I would've, like, connected

00:52:30.604 --> 00:52:32.561
that I was having, like,

00:52:32.561 --> 00:52:35.864
"Oh, she really hot," type of feelings.

00:52:35.864 --> 00:52:37.314
SAM: Hmm.

00:52:37.314 --> 00:52:40.894
But you-- just because I'm morbidly curious.

00:52:40.894 --> 00:52:41.727
MARISHA: Sure.

00:52:41.727 --> 00:52:44.684
SAM: You did have-- who was your first boyfriend?

00:52:44.684 --> 00:52:46.310
MARISHA: His name was--

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:47.143
SAM: Oh my god.

00:52:47.143 --> 00:52:49.622
TRAVIS: It is not written down somewhere.
LAURA: Did you really write that down?

00:52:49.622 --> 00:52:52.064
MARISHA: His name--

00:52:52.064 --> 00:52:53.755
Hmm.

00:52:53.755 --> 00:52:54.588
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:56.999
SAM: Yeza.

00:52:56.999 --> 00:52:59.374
(screaming) I'll fucking murder you!

00:52:59.374 --> 00:53:00.867
LAURA: (screaming)
TRAVIS: Dunamancy's real!

00:53:00.867 --> 00:53:02.893
MATT: (as Yeza) "It just never came up!
I didn't know how to bring it--"

00:53:02.893 --> 00:53:04.295
TRAVIS: Time travel!

00:53:04.295 --> 00:53:06.270
(laughter)

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:07.894
LIAM: Full circle.

00:53:07.894 --> 00:53:08.914
MARISHA: Fuck, fuck.

00:53:08.914 --> 00:53:10.834
LAURA: You can make it up, we won't know.

00:53:10.834 --> 00:53:12.463
MARISHA: His name was--

00:53:12.463 --> 00:53:14.324
Um, Tony.

00:53:15.226 --> 00:53:16.702
LAURA: Matony.

00:53:16.702 --> 00:53:17.697
TRAVIS: Matony?

00:53:17.697 --> 00:53:18.930
LAURA: Matony.

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:22.034
LIAM: Wasn't your alter ego Tori?
SAM: Did you say Tony?

00:53:22.034 --> 00:53:22.867
TRAVIS: Tony?

00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:25.524
MARISHA: No.
MATT: Matony.

00:53:25.524 --> 00:53:26.469
Hi, guys.

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:27.834
SAM: Did you guys date for a while?

00:53:27.834 --> 00:53:29.399
It was must have been very awkward.

00:53:29.399 --> 00:53:31.484
MARISHA: It was not--
TRAVIS: ♪ My Tony ♪

00:53:31.484 --> 00:53:32.317
ASHLEY: ♪ My Tony ♪

00:53:33.164 --> 00:53:34.297
TRAVIS: ♪ Wherever I go ♪

00:53:34.297 --> 00:53:36.874
MARISHA: We were teenagers. It wasn't,

00:53:36.874 --> 00:53:39.194
like, a thing, and then we were kind of--

00:53:39.194 --> 00:53:42.462
We ended up being more bros than anything, after a bit.

00:53:42.462 --> 00:53:47.421
And then that was actually when I did start dating Tori.

00:53:47.421 --> 00:53:51.300
LAURA: Tony into Tori? Oh, he must of felt so bad.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.278
MARISHA: Well, Tori--

00:53:53.278 --> 00:53:56.964
Tori was the first lady that I dated.

00:53:56.964 --> 00:53:59.764
LIAM: That must've been supremely confusing.

00:53:59.764 --> 00:54:01.340
Those two names in a row.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.938
MARISHA: (laughs) Uh-huh!

00:54:03.938 --> 00:54:07.006
Well, you know I'm trying to--

00:54:07.006 --> 00:54:09.194
There's been-- I've been hit in the head a lot, you know,

00:54:09.194 --> 00:54:12.202
as a monk, so I don't think his name was Tony.

00:54:14.494 --> 00:54:15.479
LAURA: Maybe it's like, you know,

00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:17.684
when you get a tattoo and then you regret the tattoo

00:54:17.684 --> 00:54:19.901
so you have to date somebody that has a similar name

00:54:19.901 --> 00:54:21.365
so you can, like, fix the tattoo?
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:21.365 --> 00:54:23.661
SAM: Is that why you have a Toby tattoo?

00:54:23.661 --> 00:54:26.244
(laughter)

00:54:26.244 --> 00:54:27.077
MATT: Canon.

00:54:27.077 --> 00:54:29.644
MARISHA: It just got really muddy. I just--

00:54:29.644 --> 00:54:30.993
They just kept adding lines.

00:54:30.993 --> 00:54:35.344
LIAM: Name, line.
Name, line. Name, line.

00:54:35.344 --> 00:54:37.819
TALIESIN: Kind of got rid of the-- covered up the--

00:54:37.819 --> 00:54:41.774
MATT: Dagen's like, "Is that your kill list?"

00:54:41.774 --> 00:54:42.716
Sure!

00:54:42.716 --> 00:54:44.874
(laughter)

00:54:44.874 --> 00:54:47.985
MARISHA: No, no tattoos of Tony or Tori.

00:54:49.314 --> 00:54:51.824
MATT: During this conversation,

00:54:51.824 --> 00:54:53.304
a voice creeps into your head.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

00:54:53.304 --> 00:54:54.604
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
LIAM: Balls.

00:54:55.522 --> 00:54:56.754
MATT: An unfamiliar voice.

00:54:56.754 --> 00:54:58.627
SAM: (exaggerated Italian accent)
It's me, Tony!

00:54:58.627 --> 00:55:00.634
(laughter)

00:55:00.634 --> 00:55:03.190
TRAVIS: Wait! There is a spirit.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:05.469
SAM: I heard you been talking about me!

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:07.214
(laughter)

00:55:07.214 --> 00:55:09.633
MARISHA: I hate it when people from high school call you.

00:55:09.633 --> 00:55:11.156
(laughter)

00:55:11.156 --> 00:55:13.067
SAM: (same accent)
I found you on Facebook!

00:55:13.067 --> 00:55:15.674
How you doin'?

00:55:15.674 --> 00:55:17.444
MARISHA: Ah, why?

00:55:17.444 --> 00:55:19.277
What did I see in this guy?

00:55:19.277 --> 00:55:20.557
(laughter)

00:55:20.557 --> 00:55:21.390
MATT: So!

00:55:23.694 --> 00:55:25.194
Unfamiliar voice goes,

00:55:26.691 --> 00:55:30.314
"Associate of Essek, Uraya, here,

00:55:30.314 --> 00:55:35.087
"sending word to keep Essek
updated of your estimated arrival.

00:55:35.087 --> 00:55:38.314
"Should you need emergency aid, reach out.

00:55:38.314 --> 00:55:40.294
"Be careful." That's all.

00:55:40.294 --> 00:55:42.451
LIAM: Pretty close to your accent.

00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:44.925
LAURA: How far away are we from--

00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:49.154
Did-- Wait. Essek, from that message--

00:55:49.154 --> 00:55:51.644
Was Essek trying to find out how far away we are?

00:55:51.644 --> 00:55:54.654
MATT: He was saying to keep him

00:55:54.654 --> 00:55:57.858
aware of whenever you're getting close,

00:55:57.858 --> 00:55:58.958
essentially.
LAURA: Okay!

00:55:58.958 --> 00:56:00.394
We will-- huh?

00:56:00.394 --> 00:56:03.234
We're around two days away, I think.

00:56:03.234 --> 00:56:05.714
But I'm not totally sure.

00:56:05.714 --> 00:56:09.054
Please tell him that we like him a whole lot

00:56:09.054 --> 00:56:10.654
and miss him.

00:56:10.654 --> 00:56:13.672
TALIESIN: Two days from him,
or two days from our destination?

00:56:13.672 --> 00:56:15.884
TRAVIS: From that general region, yeah.

00:56:15.884 --> 00:56:18.054
From. We're kind of on the same--

00:56:18.054 --> 00:56:18.917
Yeah.

00:56:20.344 --> 00:56:23.224
LAURA: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:56:23.224 --> 00:56:24.217
I'll send a message.

00:56:24.217 --> 00:56:27.300
I don't know how many words that was.

00:56:28.525 --> 00:56:30.785
MATT: And you'll never know.

00:56:30.785 --> 00:56:33.281
TALIESIN: Do have any more, or are you out?

00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:36.148
LAURA: ♪ Do, do, do, do, do! ♪

00:56:38.149 --> 00:56:39.622
TALIESIN: I mean, do you have any more message spells?

00:56:39.622 --> 00:56:40.455
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

00:56:40.455 --> 00:56:43.334
(laughter)

00:56:43.334 --> 00:56:46.922
MATT: I was like, that is the weirdest response.

00:56:46.922 --> 00:56:47.827
TRAVIS: From Robin Hood.

00:56:47.827 --> 00:56:49.964
TALIESIN: Going full Robin Hood. Never go full Robin Hood.

00:56:49.964 --> 00:56:51.894
ASHLEY and TRAVIS:
♪ Do, Do, Do, Do, Do. ♪

00:56:51.894 --> 00:56:53.004
LIAM: Yes or no?

00:56:53.004 --> 00:56:55.184
MATT: Jester just goes full tilt

00:56:55.184 --> 00:56:56.281
in the middle of this journey.

00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:58.136
LIAM: ♪ Do, Do, Do, Do, Do ♪

00:56:58.136 --> 00:57:00.381
MATT: And we've lost her.

00:57:00.381 --> 00:57:01.681
(laughter)

00:57:01.681 --> 00:57:04.791
TALIESIN: You did the Walken song.
Why'd you do the Walken song?

00:57:04.791 --> 00:57:07.541
(laughter)

00:57:08.394 --> 00:57:11.174
LAURA: Yes, I do have more messages I can send.

00:57:11.174 --> 00:57:13.434
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good,
because I have a super serious message

00:57:13.434 --> 00:57:15.886
I want to send that requires real--
LAURA: Okay, I'm ready.

00:57:15.886 --> 00:57:18.406
TRAVIS: (gun cocking sound)

00:57:18.406 --> 00:57:21.032
TALIESIN: Would you mind checking in with

00:57:21.032 --> 00:57:23.294
my sister, Calliope, just to make sure everything at home

00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:26.019
is copacetic?

00:57:26.019 --> 00:57:26.852
LAURA: Yes, what would you--

00:57:26.852 --> 00:57:29.824
Just ask her if everything's okay? Anything specific?

00:57:29.824 --> 00:57:32.614
TALIESIN: How things are going. How mom and dad are.

00:57:32.614 --> 00:57:35.514
If everything's-- And that, you know, we're--

00:57:35.514 --> 00:57:37.334
We've got some stuff to do and it's dangerous,

00:57:37.334 --> 00:57:39.467
but hopefully everything's going to work out.

00:57:39.467 --> 00:57:41.590
Let them know when it's all over.

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:43.123
LAURA: Okay, and this is to Calliope?

00:57:43.123 --> 00:57:45.123
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

00:57:47.518 --> 00:57:49.345
Hey, it's Jester!

00:57:49.345 --> 00:57:51.224
With Caduceus.

00:57:51.224 --> 00:57:54.260
How are things at home? Mom and dad okay?

00:57:55.634 --> 00:57:57.187
How's the Grove?

00:57:59.404 --> 00:58:01.577
How's the circle of thumbs up?

00:58:01.577 --> 00:58:03.554
TALIESIN: Are we-- we're going to be

00:58:03.554 --> 00:58:06.224
doing dangerous stuff, but it's okay.

00:58:06.224 --> 00:58:07.658
Be home soon.
LAURA: I'm not--

00:58:07.658 --> 00:58:09.793
MARISHA: "How's the circle of thumbs up?"

00:58:09.793 --> 00:58:11.582
(laughter)

00:58:11.582 --> 00:58:12.681
TALIESIN: I didn't even hear it.

00:58:12.681 --> 00:58:14.105
(laughter)

00:58:14.105 --> 00:58:16.304
LIAM: That was at A?.

00:58:16.304 --> 00:58:18.187
MATT: Yeah.

00:58:18.187 --> 00:58:20.349
Calliope responds,

00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:24.697
"Oh, everything's okay. We've planted the crystals."

00:58:24.697 --> 00:58:26.304
LAURA: Planted the crystals.
TALIESIN: Mm.

00:58:26.304 --> 00:58:29.744
MATT: "Taking root."
LAURA: Taking root.

00:58:29.744 --> 00:58:31.591
MATT: "Excited to show when he comes back."

00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:33.704
LAURA: (gasps) Everything sounds like it's great!

00:58:33.704 --> 00:58:36.424
She's excited to show you.

00:58:36.424 --> 00:58:39.073
TALIESIN: All right. All right, that's good to know.

00:58:39.073 --> 00:58:41.904
LAURA: I'm sorry I didn't tell her we were entering trouble.

00:58:41.904 --> 00:58:44.714
TALIESIN: Probably for the best

00:58:44.714 --> 00:58:46.392
that they don't worry, anyway.

00:58:46.392 --> 00:58:47.354
LAURA: (sighs)

00:58:47.354 --> 00:58:49.904
You never ask me to send messages and I got it all wrong.

00:58:49.904 --> 00:58:52.554
TALIESIN: No, it was pretty good, actually, it's a--

00:58:52.554 --> 00:58:55.504
If anything, I appreciate that they're probably

00:58:55.504 --> 00:58:57.544
a little confused. That makes me feel better.

00:58:57.544 --> 00:58:59.087
LAURA: Okay. That's good.

00:59:01.049 --> 00:59:02.851
I got one left. Anybody? Anybody?

00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:04.127
Up for grabs here.

00:59:05.704 --> 00:59:07.474
I got two left, technically.
MARISHA: Let's save it,

00:59:07.474 --> 00:59:09.124
just in case-ies.
LAURA: Okay.

00:59:09.124 --> 00:59:11.074
TALIESIN: You could prank call somebody, if you want.

00:59:11.074 --> 00:59:13.680
ASHLEY: I know, I'm trying to think of somebody.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.354
TALIESIN: Somebody you've never met, just put a voice into

00:59:15.354 --> 00:59:16.187
their head.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:59:16.187 --> 00:59:17.234
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:59:17.234 --> 00:59:19.267
ASHLEY: Think about it. Well, let's save them.

00:59:19.267 --> 00:59:20.725
LAURA: Okay.

00:59:20.725 --> 00:59:22.942
MATT: Okay. So--

00:59:22.942 --> 00:59:25.323
ASHLEY: Actually, could we put a call into Tony?

00:59:25.323 --> 00:59:27.650
No, I'm just kidding.
(laughter)

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:28.588
TALIESIN: Where he is, what he's doing.

00:59:28.588 --> 00:59:30.045
MARISHA: Oh shit, you've still have my number?

00:59:30.045 --> 00:59:31.224
(laughter)

00:59:31.224 --> 00:59:34.329
TALIESIN: What he's thinking about.
Is he thinking about you?

00:59:34.329 --> 00:59:35.612
Doubt he'll ever return.

00:59:36.704 --> 00:59:38.704
MATT: New mind, who dis?

00:59:39.804 --> 00:59:41.712
SAM: Is he alone? Is he thinking of me?

00:59:41.712 --> 00:59:44.484
MATT: All right. So as the day draws to a close,

00:59:44.484 --> 00:59:46.344
you camp up for another evening, I assume

00:59:46.344 --> 00:59:47.784
with the tower once again?

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:50.292
LIAM: Yeah, and--
MARISHA: But before we do that,

00:59:50.292 --> 00:59:54.081
as we're trotting that way, I trot up to Caleb:

00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:56.004
Hey, hey, hey, question.

00:59:56.004 --> 00:59:58.524
When you set this thing up,

00:59:58.524 --> 01:00:01.514
if you wanted to change a little tiny things

01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:03.144
do you have to do that ahead of time?

01:00:03.144 --> 01:00:06.527
Or can I, like, will it into
existence when I'm in the tower?

01:00:06.527 --> 01:00:07.957
LIAM: You have to ask me now.

01:00:07.957 --> 01:00:09.244
MARISHA: I have to ask you now.

01:00:09.244 --> 01:00:11.080
LIAM: Circle of trust.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.566
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:15.234
No, this is just good information to know,

01:00:15.234 --> 01:00:18.004
so I'll get back to you on that later, I think.

01:00:18.004 --> 01:00:21.037
LIAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:22.394 --> 01:00:23.787
Thank you.
LIAM: Sure.

01:00:24.974 --> 01:00:25.807
MATT: All righty.

01:00:26.854 --> 01:00:31.124
So after you've set up your nein-sided tower,

01:00:31.124 --> 01:00:34.774
and the evening's rest ensues, unless anybody else--?

01:00:34.774 --> 01:00:36.424
LIAM: Well, I just wanted to-- one small detail.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.144
When we all gather for dinner,

01:00:38.144 --> 01:00:40.864
I use Major Image to make a

01:00:40.864 --> 01:00:45.159
spectral Hupperdook around the entire table

01:00:45.159 --> 01:00:49.554
with dim little Hupperdook fireworks going off

01:00:49.554 --> 01:00:51.854
around, just for ambiance. That's all.

01:00:51.854 --> 01:00:52.894
Small detail.

01:00:52.894 --> 01:00:55.614
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Kiri.

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:56.545
SAM: Aww.

01:00:57.704 --> 01:00:59.787
LAURA: I haven't talked to her in so long.

01:00:59.787 --> 01:01:00.814
MARISHA: How is she?

01:01:00.814 --> 01:01:02.474
I approve of this, let's do this.

01:01:02.474 --> 01:01:04.469
SAM: Birds don't live long.

01:01:04.469 --> 01:01:05.559
MARISHA: That's not true.

01:01:05.559 --> 01:01:06.792
LAURA: She's still alive.
SAM: Okay, okay.

01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:08.946
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Kiri.
MATT: All right.

01:01:08.946 --> 01:01:13.574
LAURA: Kiri! How are you? We miss you!

01:01:13.574 --> 01:01:16.614
Um. We're in snow right now.

01:01:16.614 --> 01:01:20.197
How's Hupperdook? Looking at fireworks?

01:01:21.364 --> 01:01:24.684
Tell me you're cute! Also, that

01:01:24.684 --> 01:01:26.682
you're good.

01:01:28.344 --> 01:01:29.613
MATT: The response comes,

01:01:29.613 --> 01:01:31.267
"We miss you!

01:01:33.906 --> 01:01:36.648
"Hupperdook is interesting."

01:01:36.648 --> 01:01:38.504
LAURA: (gasps)

01:01:38.504 --> 01:01:39.337
MATT: "It's fun.

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:44.266
"We miss you!

01:01:47.244 --> 01:01:48.816
"I built something."

01:01:48.816 --> 01:01:50.729
There's all these strange voices coming through

01:01:50.729 --> 01:01:52.534
with the different phrases from people

01:01:52.534 --> 01:01:54.934
she's picked up around her since then and such.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:58.648
"Please come!"

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.521
LAURA: (gasps)

01:02:00.521 --> 01:02:02.552
MATT: "I am sweet." And that's where it ends.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.234
(awwing and laughter)

01:02:05.234 --> 01:02:08.417
LAURA: She built something, how fun.

01:02:09.514 --> 01:02:10.347
ASHLEY: Wonder what she--

01:02:10.347 --> 01:02:12.951
SAM: Or at least someone who talked to her built something.

01:02:12.951 --> 01:02:16.804
LAURA: No, she knows how to use words that people say.

01:02:16.804 --> 01:02:17.807
SAM: Well, I mean.

01:02:22.296 --> 01:02:25.164
LAURA: Oh, we need to go back and visit her soon, okay?

01:02:25.164 --> 01:02:26.978
MARISHA: I would love to go back to Hupperdook.

01:02:26.978 --> 01:02:27.811
TALIESIN: Mm.

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:29.729
LAURA: It was such a party.
MARISHA: It was a good time.

01:02:29.729 --> 01:02:30.634
LIAM: Every once in a while,

01:02:30.634 --> 01:02:33.377
a little skeletal fish floats past Beauregard.

01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:35.177
MARISHA: Good time.

01:02:36.244 --> 01:02:37.307
Lots of good times.

01:02:40.334 --> 01:02:42.384
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's it.

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:44.042
MATT: All righty.

01:02:44.042 --> 01:02:46.634
Well, a night's rest comes to a close.

01:02:46.634 --> 01:02:48.594
The following morning, breakfast awaits you

01:02:48.594 --> 01:02:52.674
with a fine, early morning meal shared amongst you.

01:02:52.674 --> 01:02:54.084
You gather your things and make your way

01:02:54.084 --> 01:02:55.928
back out through the main entrance into the

01:02:55.928 --> 01:02:59.714
cold, frozen north of Eiselcross once again.

01:02:59.714 --> 01:03:01.934
Trudging back out onto the snow and ice,

01:03:01.934 --> 01:03:03.094
as Dagen leads you forward,

01:03:03.094 --> 01:03:05.154
I need somebody else to go ahead and roll a d20.

01:03:05.154 --> 01:03:07.552
SAM: That would be Liam Oberon.

01:03:07.552 --> 01:03:10.394
LIAM: I'm going to use my new die.
MATT: Do it!

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.465
LIAM: Two!
SAM: (laughs)

01:03:13.465 --> 01:03:15.604
TRAVIS: It's going to be good.

01:03:15.604 --> 01:03:16.704
LIAM: Or nasty.

01:03:17.884 --> 01:03:19.484
MATT: So upon exiting, already the sky

01:03:19.484 --> 01:03:21.337
is darker than the previous day.

01:03:21.337 --> 01:03:22.645
(laughter)

01:03:22.645 --> 01:03:27.645
A bright blue that led you on a gracious journey

01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:29.284
without issue.

01:03:29.284 --> 01:03:31.394
Within the first hour of travel,

01:03:31.394 --> 01:03:33.114
the temperature gets colder,

01:03:33.114 --> 01:03:35.434
the wind kicks up stronger,

01:03:35.434 --> 01:03:37.684
cutting and biting through you.

01:03:37.684 --> 01:03:40.395
The snowfall gets heavier,

01:03:40.395 --> 01:03:41.500
and heavier,

01:03:42.884 --> 01:03:45.914
and it begins to sting like hail.

01:03:45.914 --> 01:03:48.922
Before you realize you are in the center of an ice storm

01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:51.821
that is beginning to spray down from above.

01:03:51.821 --> 01:03:52.654
ASHLEY: Ow!
MATT: Clustering up

01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:54.151
best you can, Dagen's like,

01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:56.905
"This is bad! It's real-- best stay close.

01:03:56.905 --> 01:04:00.064
"If you got shields, keep them up! Ugh."

01:04:00.064 --> 01:04:00.897
TRAVIS: Shields up!

01:04:00.897 --> 01:04:02.094
MATT: He bundles up even heavier,

01:04:02.094 --> 01:04:05.137
and continues to push forward as you guys continue.

01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:08.111
LAURA: Yasha, do you want to hold up the other shield that--

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:10.326
Oh wait, did we lose the other shield that Veth was on?

01:04:10.326 --> 01:04:11.192
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

01:04:11.192 --> 01:04:13.544
MATT: You're able to recover it.
LAURA: Okay.

01:04:13.544 --> 01:04:15.162
We can hold them up like umbrellas, at least.

01:04:15.162 --> 01:04:17.052
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can help get underneath.

01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:20.618
MATT: I need all of you to make a
constitution saving for me, please.

01:04:20.618 --> 01:04:22.344
ASHLEY: Oh!
TRAVIS: Oof.

01:04:22.344 --> 01:04:26.578
LIAM: If it's really bad,
I could just throw up the tower now.

01:04:26.578 --> 01:04:28.186
SAM, LAURA, and LIAM: Now!

01:04:28.186 --> 01:04:30.567
MATT: "That's up to you. We'll lose a day of travel."

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:31.926
TALIESIN: Nope, not very good.

01:04:32.904 --> 01:04:34.851
MARISHA: Natural one for me.

01:04:34.851 --> 01:04:36.136
TRAVIS: 11.

01:04:36.136 --> 01:04:37.404
LAURA: Seven!

01:04:37.404 --> 01:04:39.261
LIAM: 11.

01:04:39.261 --> 01:04:40.464
SAM: Five!

01:04:40.464 --> 01:04:41.297
ASHLEY: 18.

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:43.087
TALIESIN: Six.

01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:44.856
TRAVIS: Shit!
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:04:44.856 --> 01:04:46.355
LIAM: Whoa!

01:04:46.355 --> 01:04:47.284
TRAVIS: That's the lowest group roll.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.374
MATT: So Yasha!
LAURA: Yasha!

01:04:49.374 --> 01:04:52.694
MATT: You hold up that shield and push through.

01:04:52.694 --> 01:04:54.414
After the first 30 minutes going,

01:04:54.414 --> 01:04:55.724
"We're doing okay," and you look back

01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:57.214
and the rest of your group is just

01:04:57.214 --> 01:04:59.434
beaten and pushing along.

01:04:59.434 --> 01:05:01.014
And you come back and try and help and rally

01:05:01.014 --> 01:05:03.124
and Dagen's pushing through and he's yelling,

01:05:03.124 --> 01:05:05.646
and it gets to the point where the sound of the storm

01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:06.584
and the wind is so loud that you're

01:05:06.584 --> 01:05:09.504
having to shout just to communicate to each other.

01:05:09.504 --> 01:05:12.074
But you continue pushing through for the day.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:15.966
And you make some distance,
you still make the journey's length.

01:05:15.966 --> 01:05:18.044
But by the end of the day,

01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:21.274
you are beaten, you are exhausted,

01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:23.644
and even though you are taking a night's rest,

01:05:23.644 --> 01:05:25.724
you know the following morning

01:05:25.724 --> 01:05:28.035
is not going to greet you kindly.

01:05:28.035 --> 01:05:29.844
So setting up for another night's rest?

01:05:29.844 --> 01:05:31.394
LIAM: Yeah, I forgot,

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.794
with my transmuter's stone, that would be a 16 for me.

01:05:33.794 --> 01:05:36.274
So I don't know if that helps me enough.

01:05:36.274 --> 01:05:38.175
MATT: Ah, not quite.
LIAM: Okay.

01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:40.214
MATT: You missed it by one.

01:05:40.214 --> 01:05:41.254
LIAM: This much.
MATT: Yep.

01:05:41.254 --> 01:05:42.087
LIAM: (whooshing)

01:05:42.087 --> 01:05:46.864
LAURA: Can we have really amazing bathtubs prepared?

01:05:46.864 --> 01:05:49.637
There's already there, is there?
LIAM: They're always there, piping hot.

01:05:49.637 --> 01:05:51.434
MATT: "You wouldn't happen to have, like, a

01:05:51.434 --> 01:05:54.134
"bunch of kitty masseuses that can do a number

01:05:54.134 --> 01:05:55.144
"on these shoulders?"

01:05:55.144 --> 01:05:57.745
LIAM: Every kitty here is a licensed masseuse.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.094
(laughter)

01:05:59.094 --> 01:06:01.674
MATT: "You are my favorite weird wizard friend.

01:06:01.674 --> 01:06:03.896
"Thank you."
(laughter)

01:06:03.896 --> 01:06:06.344
LIAM: We'll send one of the big fellows to your room.

01:06:06.344 --> 01:06:07.977
MATT: "Please do!"
LIAM: Really stomp on your back.

01:06:07.977 --> 01:06:10.728
MATT: "You got it. Up!"

01:06:10.728 --> 01:06:12.183
ASHLEY: Kitty biscuits!

01:06:12.183 --> 01:06:13.864
LAURA: Oh, that is going to feel so good.

01:06:13.864 --> 01:06:15.654
TRAVIS: Big old kitty.

01:06:15.654 --> 01:06:16.487
MATT: All righty.

01:06:17.834 --> 01:06:20.464
You all manage to find yourselves a night's rest,

01:06:20.464 --> 01:06:23.764
but when the morning comes you are sore,

01:06:23.764 --> 01:06:25.414
and you're exhausted, quite literally.

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:26.727
Everyone takes two points of exhaustion.

01:06:26.727 --> 01:06:27.966
LAURA: Two points?!

01:06:27.966 --> 01:06:30.017
MATT: For the next day of the journey--
MARISHA: Everybody?

01:06:30.017 --> 01:06:31.876
MATT: Except for Yasha, who takes just one.

01:06:31.876 --> 01:06:33.196
MARISHA: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: Two points of exhaustion.

01:06:33.196 --> 01:06:36.634
LAURA: Holy moly.
MATT: It was a heavy storm.

01:06:36.634 --> 01:06:39.384
LIAM: And I absolutely did send a battle cat-sized

01:06:39.384 --> 01:06:42.851
spectral cat to Dagen's room that night.

01:06:42.851 --> 01:06:43.794
MATT: And he is thankful.

01:06:43.794 --> 01:06:45.593
The next morning when you all wake up, he's like,

01:06:45.593 --> 01:06:48.964
"Ah, I mean, the rest of me's fucked,

01:06:48.964 --> 01:06:51.246
"but these shoulders are golden."

01:06:52.805 --> 01:06:53.954
MARISHA: What does two points do?

01:06:53.954 --> 01:06:54.987
Yeah, hang on.

01:06:54.987 --> 01:06:57.449
Let me see. Does it tell us on D&amp;D Beyond?

01:06:57.449 --> 01:07:00.734
MATT: Two points of exhaustion means your speed is halved.

01:07:00.734 --> 01:07:02.380
TRAVIS: And disadvantage on ability check?

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.133
MATT: And disadvantage on ability checks, too. Yeah.

01:07:04.133 --> 01:07:06.099
LAURA: Jeez louise.

01:07:06.099 --> 01:07:09.471
MARISHA: Fuck. How much further do we have on our journey?

01:07:10.821 --> 01:07:12.514
MATT: From this point, you have--

01:07:12.514 --> 01:07:14.006
LAURA: I mean, to counteract.
MATT: Well,

01:07:14.006 --> 01:07:15.294
you would've had two more days, but

01:07:15.294 --> 01:07:18.467
now it'll be three because of that storm, unfortunately.

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:20.414
LAURA: We should've just fucking held still.

01:07:20.414 --> 01:07:22.160
We wouldn't have

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.234
lost the--
TALIESIN: We would've lost the day.

01:07:24.234 --> 01:07:25.603
MATT: I left the option, but.

01:07:25.603 --> 01:07:27.070
LAURA: (sighs)
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:07:28.054 --> 01:07:28.887
MARISHA: Hmm.

01:07:28.887 --> 01:07:31.726
LIAM: I do create gigantic vats of

01:07:31.726 --> 01:07:35.314
steel cut oats and sliced banana and cinnamon

01:07:35.314 --> 01:07:37.222
and raisins and dates

01:07:37.222 --> 01:07:38.222
and apricots--
LAURA: Thank you.

01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:41.584
LIAM: -- and also bacon and also waffles and also pancakes.

01:07:41.584 --> 01:07:43.016
TRAVIS: Ah fuck, sounds so good.

01:07:43.016 --> 01:07:44.007
MATT: That does sound really good.

01:07:44.007 --> 01:07:44.894
That's problematic.

01:07:45.834 --> 01:07:46.667
All right.

01:07:46.667 --> 01:07:47.846
LAURA: That sounds so good!

01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:49.329
MATT: That does sounds really good.

01:07:49.329 --> 01:07:51.494
MARISHA: I got kind of lost in it for a second.

01:07:51.494 --> 01:07:53.539
LIAM: Welcome to the International House of Cats.

01:07:53.539 --> 01:07:55.832
(laughter)

01:07:55.832 --> 01:07:56.983
TRAVIS: With, like, six different kinds of syrup.

01:07:56.983 --> 01:07:58.800
MARISHA: The IHAC? Wait.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.904
MARISHA: The IHOC.

01:07:59.904 --> 01:08:01.194
Yeah!
MATT: There you go.

01:08:01.194 --> 01:08:04.085
LIAM: (hocks a hairball)

01:08:04.085 --> 01:08:05.444
MATT: A delicious breakfast is had

01:08:05.444 --> 01:08:07.644
and it does help take the edge off a little bit, but

01:08:07.644 --> 01:08:09.304
as you all gather your supplies

01:08:09.304 --> 01:08:11.804
and your sacks and your bundled clothing,

01:08:11.804 --> 01:08:16.156
and the door opens once more
to the cold, uninviting exterior,

01:08:16.156 --> 01:08:18.781
you all feel a shiver, and with that shiver,

01:08:18.781 --> 01:08:21.688
you feel every bruise and every sore muscle in your body

01:08:21.688 --> 01:08:24.154
just groan internally as one by one

01:08:24.154 --> 01:08:27.094
you follow Dagen's lead outside into the cold wilderness.

01:08:27.094 --> 01:08:29.462
LIAM: That's why I put bourbon in the oatmeal.

01:08:29.462 --> 01:08:30.442
MATT: (chuckles)

01:08:32.092 --> 01:08:33.648
MARISHA: Sucks!

01:08:33.648 --> 01:08:36.404
MATT: Dagen, you can see is now pulling out his

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:38.338
heavy jug and taking swigs and he's like,

01:08:38.338 --> 01:08:41.759
"This-- My apologies, folks, this is--

01:08:41.759 --> 01:08:43.348
"that was a rough day. We're going to be

01:08:43.348 --> 01:08:47.114
"a little behind schedule, but just keep an eye out."

01:08:47.114 --> 01:08:49.997
LAURA: We could polymorph again. Get an extra--

01:08:49.997 --> 01:08:52.324
LIAM: Just to make a decent amount of distance

01:08:52.324 --> 01:08:54.834
if not, and edge.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:08:54.834 --> 01:08:57.764
TALIESIN: Maybe not a bird

01:08:57.764 --> 01:09:00.634
and maybe like a big elephant, wooly mammoth thing

01:09:00.634 --> 01:09:03.031
or something snowable?
LAURA: Well, if we fly at least,

01:09:03.031 --> 01:09:06.114
we get to not deal with the snow at all.

01:09:06.114 --> 01:09:08.314
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Which is a bonus.

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:09.147
LIAM: And--

01:09:09.147 --> 01:09:11.275
MARISHA: Well, how's the weather? Flying against the storm?

01:09:11.275 --> 01:09:13.008
TRAVIS: We have to roll for it, I think.

01:09:13.008 --> 01:09:13.991
LAURA: Or would we--

01:09:13.991 --> 01:09:16.134
MATT: We'd still roll to see how it happens for the day.

01:09:16.134 --> 01:09:16.967
LAURA: Okay.

01:09:16.967 --> 01:09:18.796
MATT: But at least if you were to

01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:21.734
take flight form, you're still
half speed in the creature's--

01:09:21.734 --> 01:09:22.904
LIAM: Half of the creature's speed.

01:09:22.904 --> 01:09:24.504
MATT: Creature's speed, yes.

01:09:24.504 --> 01:09:25.994
Although!

01:09:25.994 --> 01:09:27.224
LAURA: Oh wait, we lose exhaustion.

01:09:27.224 --> 01:09:28.894
MATT: No, it's an interesting point.

01:09:28.894 --> 01:09:31.354
Let me do a quick--
SAM: Oh boy.

01:09:31.354 --> 01:09:32.331
MATT: A quick check.
LIAM: Oh man.

01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:34.605
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ooh!

01:09:34.605 --> 01:09:37.920
TRAVIS: This rule check brought to you by Hot Topic.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.774
MATT: Doing a quick--
SAM: Hot Topic.

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:41.275
This is a backpack hanger.

01:09:41.275 --> 01:09:43.954
(laughter)

01:09:43.954 --> 01:09:45.574
ASHLEY: That'd be awesome if just in the mix

01:09:45.574 --> 01:09:47.685
that shirt was sold that you have on.

01:09:47.685 --> 01:09:48.859
(laughter)

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:50.317
ASHLEY: Just one of Marisha.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:09:50.317 --> 01:09:52.029
(laughter)

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:53.254
MARISHA: Just a bunch of CR shirts,

01:09:53.254 --> 01:09:54.444
and then my old headshot.

01:09:54.444 --> 01:09:58.239
SAM: Go to your local Hot Topic
and request this shirt, please.

01:09:58.239 --> 01:10:01.244
MATT: It might be a deeper glance--

01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:04.871
I would say, for the time that you are polymorphed,

01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:06.634
I would say you would not have the points of exhaustion

01:10:06.634 --> 01:10:09.952
during the polymorph, but they return when you're done.

01:10:09.952 --> 01:10:12.854
MARISHA: Where did you find that photo?

01:10:12.854 --> 01:10:14.004
MATT: That's an interesting point.

01:10:14.004 --> 01:10:16.251
TALIESIN: Don't ask that right now.

01:10:16.251 --> 01:10:17.224
LIAM: Oh no.

01:10:17.224 --> 01:10:18.944
MATT: Oh, he finds them all.

01:10:18.944 --> 01:10:20.684
MARISHA: It feels like some website that I definitely

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:23.319
need to delete. If you found it.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:25.306
LIAM: Could be a traitor inside the house.

01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:27.291
(laughter)

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.677
TALIESIN: Somewhere there's a Geocities account.

01:10:29.677 --> 01:10:30.923
ASHLEY: Omar!

01:10:30.923 --> 01:10:33.673
(laughter)

01:10:35.524 --> 01:10:38.463
MATT: Little floof chaps. Fuck him.

01:10:38.463 --> 01:10:41.032
SAM: He pulled out a USB stick in his fur.

01:10:41.032 --> 01:10:43.454
MATT: Yep. It'll fit there in the back, too.

01:10:43.454 --> 01:10:45.260
There's there's some deep chaps.

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.073
LAURA: Do we roll to see what the weather is--
MARISHA: It will fit.

01:10:47.073 --> 01:10:48.520
LAURA: -- before we polymorph?

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.411
MATT: Well, we polymorph and then we
roll to see what the weather is.

01:10:50.411 --> 01:10:53.703
LAURA: Oh jeez!
LIAM: Let's do it. I like it.

01:10:53.703 --> 01:10:55.258
LAURA: All right.
SAM: It's going to be great.

01:10:55.258 --> 01:10:56.164
LAURA: I'm going to do the same.

01:10:56.164 --> 01:10:58.297
TRAVIS: It's Veth, right?
SAM: Yep.

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:00.534
MATT: But if you can do this, this day and tomorrow

01:11:00.534 --> 01:11:02.919
you will bring it back to just two days of travel--

01:11:02.919 --> 01:11:04.924
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: -- as opposed to three, so.

01:11:04.924 --> 01:11:05.757
TRAVIS: You got it.

01:11:05.757 --> 01:11:07.854
SAM: Don't fuck me, Gil.

01:11:07.854 --> 01:11:09.424
Nine.
MATT: A nine.

01:11:09.424 --> 01:11:10.780
SAM: Like the Mighty Nein.

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.042
MATT: Hmm.

01:11:12.042 --> 01:11:13.434
SAM: That bodes well.
MATT: All right.

01:11:13.434 --> 01:11:15.404
The weather is not as bad as it was the day before.

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.514
It's still snowfall, but the winds are light

01:11:17.514 --> 01:11:20.139
and it doesn't impede your flight pattern.

01:11:20.139 --> 01:11:20.972
LAURA: Good.

01:11:20.972 --> 01:11:23.714
MATT: As the three giant eagles continue onward

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:25.652
for that one hour, gaining some of the ground

01:11:25.652 --> 01:11:29.414
that was lost, you all find yourselves exhausted

01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:31.814
once more. (exhausted breathing)

01:11:31.814 --> 01:11:33.294
And trudging forward,

01:11:33.294 --> 01:11:36.744
carefully in the snow as Dagen leads you on.

01:11:36.744 --> 01:11:39.177
About halfway through the day, Dagen goes,

01:11:41.133 --> 01:11:41.966
"I--

01:11:43.564 --> 01:11:44.397
"wait."

01:11:44.397 --> 01:11:46.264
He puts his hand up. He doesn't say anything,

01:11:46.264 --> 01:11:48.834
he just catches himself and

01:11:48.834 --> 01:11:50.879
calls up whoever's closest to him

01:11:50.879 --> 01:11:52.404
and points ahead and you can see

01:11:52.404 --> 01:11:55.844
there's this soft, smooth blanket

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:58.004
of fresh snow that covers some of these

01:11:58.004 --> 01:12:00.354
mild hills that you guys are currently heading towards.

01:12:00.354 --> 01:12:02.716
You could see a bunch of small shapes

01:12:02.716 --> 01:12:03.684
just barely poking through

01:12:03.684 --> 01:12:04.994
the top of the snow.

01:12:04.994 --> 01:12:06.912
Maybe a foot or so, about 100 or so feet

01:12:06.912 --> 01:12:07.894
off from you.

01:12:07.894 --> 01:12:09.828
SAM: Snow bunnies?

01:12:09.828 --> 01:12:11.209
TRAVIS: Shh.
SAM: Oh!

01:12:12.064 --> 01:12:14.274
MATT: Starts looking, and if anybody else wants to--

01:12:14.274 --> 01:12:16.479
two of you can make a perception check, if you'd like.

01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:18.494
LAURA: Guidance.

01:12:18.494 --> 01:12:20.359
TALIESIN: 29.
SAM: Oof!

01:12:20.359 --> 01:12:21.654
TALIESIN: Where's that roll been?

01:12:21.654 --> 01:12:22.914
MATT: Fair enough.

01:12:22.914 --> 01:12:24.894
Glancing and leaning forward,

01:12:24.894 --> 01:12:26.924
thankfully because the weather is not very bad,

01:12:26.924 --> 01:12:29.004
and because the white snow itself

01:12:29.004 --> 01:12:31.494
gives you a pretty decent bounce, for what sunlight

01:12:31.494 --> 01:12:33.594
is making its way in this region.

01:12:33.594 --> 01:12:37.136
You can see the tops of

01:12:37.136 --> 01:12:40.084
heads, or creatures unmoving.

01:12:40.084 --> 01:12:41.814
TALIESIN: We're being watched.

01:12:41.814 --> 01:12:45.044
At least, what three? Four?

01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:46.284
MATT: With that perception check,

01:12:46.284 --> 01:12:48.273
you would notice it would be seven.

01:12:48.273 --> 01:12:49.106
LAURA: Whoa!
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:12:49.106 --> 01:12:51.756
Seven, seven heads of something.

01:12:51.756 --> 01:12:53.164
LAURA: How big are the heads?

01:12:53.164 --> 01:12:55.414
TALIESIN: I mean.
LAURA: (whispering) How big are the heads?

01:12:55.414 --> 01:12:57.191
TALIESIN: That big. We might be fine?

01:12:57.191 --> 01:12:59.714
(laughter)

01:12:59.714 --> 01:13:01.454
MATT: It's hard to tell truly at this distance.

01:13:01.454 --> 01:13:04.937
Especially since most of their body is currently kind of--

01:13:04.937 --> 01:13:09.364
Well, some of it seems to be shoulders up, somewhat exposed.

01:13:09.364 --> 01:13:10.224
TALIESIN: Humanoid?

01:13:10.224 --> 01:13:12.134
MATT: They look humanoid, but they're also white in color

01:13:12.134 --> 01:13:14.234
as well. The coloration.

01:13:14.234 --> 01:13:16.814
So you can see them, but you can't make out much detail

01:13:16.814 --> 01:13:19.106
cause they're blending in with the scenery.

01:13:19.106 --> 01:13:20.661
MARISHA: Are there more yeti?

01:13:20.661 --> 01:13:24.814
TALIESIN: I mean, I don't know. I can't-- that's far.

01:13:24.814 --> 01:13:26.289
LIAM: I lean closer to Jester and say:

01:13:26.289 --> 01:13:28.974
Look, you can actually crush them from here.

01:13:28.974 --> 01:13:32.264
LAURA and LIAM: (pinching sounds)

01:13:32.264 --> 01:13:35.889
LAURA: Oh! We've taken care of them. No problem.

01:13:35.889 --> 01:13:36.830
MATT: Dagen comes in, he goes,

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.594
"Can also pinch them."

01:13:38.594 --> 01:13:39.931
LAURA: (laughs)

01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:43.585
MATT: "If that doesn't work, there's nobody even home."

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:48.585
(laughter)

01:13:48.814 --> 01:13:50.785
SAM: Wow, that's a lot of bourbon in the pancakes.

01:13:50.785 --> 01:13:53.181
(laughter)

01:13:53.181 --> 01:13:54.474
MATT: "Oh, the bourbon just got me started.

01:13:54.474 --> 01:13:56.925
"I keep my own stash. Don't worry."

01:13:56.925 --> 01:13:59.063
ASHLEY: (slurred) That oatmeal was delicious.

01:13:59.063 --> 01:14:01.084
(laughter)

01:14:01.084 --> 01:14:03.214
MATT: "Certainly hope I can track."

01:14:03.214 --> 01:14:04.429
LIAM: And breakfast.

01:14:04.429 --> 01:14:05.607
MATT: Dagen leans in,

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.164
"So what's the plan from here?

01:14:07.164 --> 01:14:09.074
"I hadn't seen something like this out here."

01:14:09.074 --> 01:14:10.324
LAURA: Ever?

01:14:10.324 --> 01:14:11.764
MATT: "Well, not in this particular, no.

01:14:11.764 --> 01:14:13.994
"But normally, creatures, they, you know,

01:14:13.994 --> 01:14:18.454
"they move, they stop. These are right still."

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.804
LAURA: Maybe they're dead?
MARISHA: All?

01:14:19.804 --> 01:14:21.364
LAURA: Maybe they're all frozen?

01:14:21.364 --> 01:14:23.194
MARISHA: Maybe they're statues.

01:14:23.194 --> 01:14:25.406
SAM: If we were to continue on, Dagen,

01:14:25.406 --> 01:14:28.464
would our path take us right through there? Around?

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.124
MATT: "We can go around."

01:14:30.124 --> 01:14:31.864
LAURA: I could try sending them a message?

01:14:31.864 --> 01:14:33.501
Maybe I can freak them out.

01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:35.994
Do you think they see us? I mean, they've got to see us.

01:14:35.994 --> 01:14:37.709
They're in the snow and we're on top of it.

01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:39.269
TALIESIN: How far away are they?

01:14:39.269 --> 01:14:40.294
MATT: About 100 feet from you.

01:14:40.294 --> 01:14:43.532
TALIESIN: 100 feet? Hmm.

01:14:43.532 --> 01:14:45.811
LIAM: I could make an illusion.

01:14:45.811 --> 01:14:48.194
Give them something to chew on.

01:14:48.194 --> 01:14:49.284
See what that causes.

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.154
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do that.
LIAM: Yeah?

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:52.234
TRAVIS: See if they chase.

01:14:52.234 --> 01:14:53.774
LIAM: Okay.

01:14:54.664 --> 01:14:57.034
I will pull out the bit of fleece that I use,

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.587
and I will create

01:15:01.216 --> 01:15:05.634
two wolves like the ones we saw in the mountains

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.452
in the midst of them.

01:15:07.452 --> 01:15:09.270
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Running about.

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:11.474
MATT: (poofing) You see two wolves now circling

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:13.174
and stalking in that center space.

01:15:13.174 --> 01:15:15.864
The entities that caught your eye

01:15:15.864 --> 01:15:18.924
as you and Dagen, the rest of the group leans in

01:15:18.924 --> 01:15:20.884
don't react.

01:15:20.884 --> 01:15:22.354
Don't move.

01:15:22.354 --> 01:15:24.034
Just still.

01:15:24.034 --> 01:15:26.190
LAURA: ♪ I wonder if they're dead. ♪

01:15:27.265 --> 01:15:29.030
TALIESIN: I think they're probably dead.

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:30.540
SAM: I don't think they're dead.

01:15:31.864 --> 01:15:34.594
They're just waiting. Waiting for us to get closer,

01:15:34.594 --> 01:15:36.277
and then pounce!
TRAVIS: Strange that they wouldn't take

01:15:36.277 --> 01:15:37.740
a shot at that, though.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.964
SAM: Blast us with their eye beams!

01:15:38.964 --> 01:15:40.784
MARISHA: Can Frumpkin go over?

01:15:40.784 --> 01:15:43.054
LIAM: He could. But first I

01:15:43.054 --> 01:15:44.954
cause the wolves to go to two of their heads

01:15:44.954 --> 01:15:48.844
and lift their legs and illusory pee on them.

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:49.677
MATT: Okay.

01:15:49.677 --> 01:15:51.400
LIAM: See if if that elicits any response.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.100
MATT: One of the wolves comes over and sniffs,

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.114
lifts the leg and urinates on one of the heads.

01:15:56.114 --> 01:15:57.207
No reaction.

01:15:59.211 --> 01:16:00.627
LIAM: (poof) They're gone.

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:04.024
LAURA: And we saw no movement at all when all of that--

01:16:04.024 --> 01:16:05.434
MATT: None.

01:16:05.434 --> 01:16:06.547
TRAVIS: Let's go!
LIAM: Okay.

01:16:06.547 --> 01:16:07.584
LAURA: I think it's safe.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:16:07.584 --> 01:16:08.722
TALIESIN: Let's--
LIAM: Hold on, hold on,

01:16:08.722 --> 01:16:11.154
it's just another two minutes. Best boy,

01:16:11.154 --> 01:16:15.025
go over there. Check those heads out, please.

01:16:15.025 --> 01:16:16.473
MATT: (cat noises)

01:16:16.473 --> 01:16:19.448
LIAM: I slap a hand on Beauregard's shoulder.

01:16:19.448 --> 01:16:20.281
MATT: Okay.

01:16:21.264 --> 01:16:22.414
You follow over

01:16:23.394 --> 01:16:25.574
and as Frumpkin approaches,

01:16:25.574 --> 01:16:27.324
you can see there are different heights

01:16:27.324 --> 01:16:29.794
because there are different humanoid creatures

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:32.477
of different lineages.

01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:36.604
Arranged in a circle. Seven of them.

01:16:36.604 --> 01:16:38.734
Mostly submerged in the snow.

01:16:38.734 --> 01:16:39.587
You can see

01:16:42.374 --> 01:16:46.804
there'd be one that is almost halfling size

01:16:46.804 --> 01:16:49.114
that is pretty much entirely beneath the snow.

01:16:49.114 --> 01:16:51.214
But there is a faint bit of it that is melted around it.

01:16:51.214 --> 01:16:55.044
In fact, the snow around these figures

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:58.254
seems to be gently melted to the point

01:16:58.254 --> 01:17:01.454
where it's not really touching the bodies.

01:17:01.454 --> 01:17:03.974
They're like there's a separate cylinder

01:17:03.974 --> 01:17:06.734
of empty space around them that prevents the snow.

01:17:06.734 --> 01:17:08.904
Like they have their own heat source.

01:17:08.904 --> 01:17:10.844
But they appear the be human.

01:17:10.844 --> 01:17:12.444
But they also are made of stone.

01:17:13.724 --> 01:17:15.098
LIAM: Are they--
MATT: Solid sculptures.

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:18.006
LIAM: -- simple sculptures? Or intricate?

01:17:18.006 --> 01:17:20.505
Finely detailed?
MATT: They're fairly intricate.

01:17:20.505 --> 01:17:22.724
and they are all sitting,

01:17:22.724 --> 01:17:26.334
and they are all arranged in a circle with their arms out

01:17:26.334 --> 01:17:28.294
towards the ones immediately to the right and left,

01:17:28.294 --> 01:17:30.964
all facing inward, in a seven-part circle.

01:17:30.964 --> 01:17:34.184
MARISHA: What's on the-- can we see what they're facing?

01:17:34.184 --> 01:17:35.017
On the inside?

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.927
MATT: From what we can tell, it's just the snow.

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:39.674
LIAM: But there's snow in the middle of them,

01:17:39.674 --> 01:17:40.804
or there is nothing in the middle?

01:17:40.804 --> 01:17:42.854
All melted out between them?

01:17:42.854 --> 01:17:45.734
MATT: Directly around each one, like

01:17:45.734 --> 01:17:47.884
a cylinder within a half a foot

01:17:47.884 --> 01:17:49.954
of where the statue bodies are

01:17:49.954 --> 01:17:52.134
the snow is melted. But then they're in

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:53.901
a much larger circle arranged

01:17:53.901 --> 01:17:56.514
and in the middle of them, it's just all the snow

01:17:56.514 --> 01:17:58.564
that's been piled up like everything else around them.

01:17:58.564 --> 01:18:00.144
LIAM: Okay, so looking through Frumpkin's eyes

01:18:00.144 --> 01:18:02.484
as he goes up and down this mound between all of them,

01:18:02.484 --> 01:18:05.054
and peeks in. Does this look like some sort of--

01:18:05.054 --> 01:18:06.924
Do they look like actual statues?

01:18:06.924 --> 01:18:09.564
Or do they look like someone-- more like they have been

01:18:09.564 --> 01:18:10.884
frozen themselves?

01:18:10.884 --> 01:18:13.134
Does this look like some sort of a ritual

01:18:13.134 --> 01:18:14.854
that they were in the midst of?

01:18:14.854 --> 01:18:16.972
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:18:16.972 --> 01:18:19.124
LAURA: Come on, Frumpkin!

01:18:19.124 --> 01:18:21.244
LIAM: Oh, the cat! Goddamn it. No.

01:18:21.244 --> 01:18:22.504
Let's say a nine.

01:18:22.504 --> 01:18:23.754
MATT: Okay.

01:18:23.754 --> 01:18:27.854
It's hard to tell. Both the blinding light,

01:18:27.854 --> 01:18:31.504
bouncing from all the nearby snow, and the fact that

01:18:31.504 --> 01:18:32.544
so much of them are submerged,

01:18:32.544 --> 01:18:34.574
it's hard to make out the details.

01:18:34.574 --> 01:18:36.964
You'll probably have to get a closer look personally.

01:18:36.964 --> 01:18:39.734
SAM: I think we have to roll everything
at disadvantage, too.

01:18:39.734 --> 01:18:41.494
LAURA: Oh, because we're--
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:18:41.494 --> 01:18:43.644
LIAM: Oh, so let's see if it's even lower.

01:18:43.644 --> 01:18:45.704
It's not. That was the worst.

01:18:45.704 --> 01:18:46.641
MARISHA: Shit.

01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:48.259
TRAVIS: We've got to check this out.
LAURA: I know, but--

01:18:48.259 --> 01:18:50.904
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: I mean, we can try--

01:18:50.904 --> 01:18:52.114
If they're petrified,

01:18:52.114 --> 01:18:56.354
maybe unpetrifying one of them, see what happens.

01:18:56.354 --> 01:18:58.754
SAM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Find out what's going on.

01:18:59.674 --> 01:19:01.534
TALIESIN: I don't know if I'm up to a fight.

01:19:01.534 --> 01:19:03.094
I don't know about the rest of you, but

01:19:03.094 --> 01:19:06.091
we're definitely feeling creaky.
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we should check out the area, right?

01:19:06.091 --> 01:19:09.264
LAURA: What if they're really, really, old people?

01:19:09.264 --> 01:19:11.439
What if they're from the ancient times?

01:19:11.439 --> 01:19:13.004
MARISHA: That would be awesome.

01:19:13.004 --> 01:19:14.394
Let's check it out.
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's go.

01:19:14.394 --> 01:19:16.525
LIAM: That's what's here. The ancient times.

01:19:16.525 --> 01:19:19.152
I throw up Detect Magic on the walk over.

01:19:19.152 --> 01:19:22.444
TRAVIS: Yeah and within 60 feet
I'll do Divine Sense, as well.

01:19:22.444 --> 01:19:23.494
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Should one or two

01:19:23.494 --> 01:19:24.694
of us just hang back.

01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:28.584
Maybe someone, like one of you two,

01:19:28.584 --> 01:19:30.864
in case we get 30 feet away

01:19:30.864 --> 01:19:32.484
and we all turn to stone or something?

01:19:32.484 --> 01:19:34.114
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my distance.

01:19:34.114 --> 01:19:36.296
LIAM: Like 105 feet, perhaps?

01:19:37.194 --> 01:19:39.804
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep 30 feet behind everybody else,

01:19:39.804 --> 01:19:42.394
at least, until it's--

01:19:42.394 --> 01:19:43.502
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Definitely some distance

01:19:43.502 --> 01:19:45.032
from this thing until--

01:19:47.424 --> 01:19:49.034
MATT: All right. Said you're casting Detect Magic?

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:50.274
LIAM: Yeah.

01:19:50.274 --> 01:19:52.554
MATT: All right. Sorry, my app crashed here.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:53.716
LAURA: You should hang back, too, Nott,

01:19:53.716 --> 01:19:56.067
so you can Mage Hand people out.

01:19:56.067 --> 01:19:57.260
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.268
SAM: If you guys weigh five pounds, I've got you.

01:19:59.268 --> 01:20:01.578
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh, never mind.

01:20:01.578 --> 01:20:05.121
SAM: But no, I'll hang back a little. Long range action.

01:20:05.121 --> 01:20:06.581
MATT: Okay.

01:20:06.581 --> 01:20:09.201
Dagen, of course, looks over at the rest,

01:20:09.201 --> 01:20:11.301
"If you know what you're doing, I'll just

01:20:12.604 --> 01:20:14.324
"stay a little behind as well."

01:20:14.324 --> 01:20:15.594
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.
MATT: And he goes and

01:20:15.594 --> 01:20:17.524
keeps a little bit of a safe distance

01:20:17.524 --> 01:20:19.704
from the rest of you in the front line.

01:20:19.704 --> 01:20:20.664
But as you approach, Caleb,

01:20:20.664 --> 01:20:24.194
and cast Detect Magic, you get a--

01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:28.774
a fairly decent magical aura from each of these.

01:20:28.774 --> 01:20:31.634
And the essence is divination-based.

01:20:31.634 --> 01:20:32.974
LIAM: Uniform for all of them?

01:20:32.974 --> 01:20:35.296
MATT: For all of them, yes.
LAURA: What does divination mean?

01:20:35.296 --> 01:20:37.514
LIAM: Sensing, learning the truth.

01:20:37.514 --> 01:20:39.206
LAURA: Oh, that makes sense.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:20:41.934 --> 01:20:44.734
TRAVIS: Anything for Divine Sense for when we're in 60 feet?

01:20:44.734 --> 01:20:47.066
Celestial, fiend, or undead?

01:20:47.066 --> 01:20:48.497
MATT: Mm-mm.

01:20:49.714 --> 01:20:52.206
MARISHA: So wait, you're getting
a divination sense from them?

01:20:52.206 --> 01:20:55.544
Can I get closer and see if I can see

01:20:55.544 --> 01:20:58.784
tool marks? Like these have been carved? Or--

01:20:58.784 --> 01:21:01.771
LIAM: We'd have to get right on them
because they're encased in snow.

01:21:01.771 --> 01:21:04.234
LAURA: Oh! I have an idea. This is stupid.

01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:06.371
MARISHA: Or, like, they're been frozen.

01:21:06.371 --> 01:21:07.845
SAM: What is your stupid idea?

01:21:07.845 --> 01:21:09.004
LAURA: Well, what if we took rope and

01:21:09.004 --> 01:21:12.974
we tied one of them up and that way, you know,

01:21:12.974 --> 01:21:15.874
if I did try to unpetrify them, then at least

01:21:15.874 --> 01:21:17.187
they'll be tied up.

01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:19.572
LIAM: That's not a stupid idea at all--
LAURA: Right away.

01:21:19.572 --> 01:21:21.619
LIAM: -- if that's what we want to attempt?

01:21:21.619 --> 01:21:23.424
MARISHA: Well, let's see if they're even petrified.

01:21:23.424 --> 01:21:24.824
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:21:24.824 --> 01:21:27.404
MATT: Okay. So you continue to approach.

01:21:27.404 --> 01:21:30.694
MARISHA: I'll start sneaking up--

01:21:30.694 --> 01:21:32.934
TALIESIN: Petrified means that we don't--
MARISHA: -- and see what happens.

01:21:32.934 --> 01:21:35.034
Like each step, I'm kind of--

01:21:35.034 --> 01:21:37.194
LAURA: I have that. I have a lot of--

01:21:37.194 --> 01:21:39.732
MARISHA: Checking for traps, I
guess? For lack of a better term.

01:21:39.732 --> 01:21:41.464
LIAM: I'm going to awkwardly tail you.

01:21:41.464 --> 01:21:42.724
I'm going to sty close behind you.

01:21:42.724 --> 01:21:43.914
MARISHA: Okay.

01:21:43.914 --> 01:21:48.014
MATT: Okay. So carefully, you all line up a bit

01:21:48.014 --> 01:21:51.634
behind Beauregard as you carefully approach.

01:21:51.634 --> 01:21:56.384
The closest one to you appears to be orc in appearance.

01:21:56.384 --> 01:21:59.004
You can see the head on top is smooth

01:21:59.004 --> 01:22:00.854
with longer hair in the back.

01:22:02.494 --> 01:22:05.834
Close to a skullet, if you will,

01:22:05.834 --> 01:22:08.084
textured down to the shoulders, and you can see

01:22:08.084 --> 01:22:13.063
from the part of the torso
that's exposed above the snow line,

01:22:13.063 --> 01:22:17.004
robes that are drifting off the shoulders.

01:22:17.004 --> 01:22:20.814
You see the arms extended outward, palms up.

01:22:20.814 --> 01:22:22.364
And then the ones off to the right and left,

01:22:22.364 --> 01:22:25.294
you can see their arms extended palms down.

01:22:25.294 --> 01:22:27.064
Then the next one over, palms up.

01:22:27.064 --> 01:22:28.324
So they're almost like--

01:22:28.324 --> 01:22:29.157
MARISHA: Alternating?

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:29.990
MATT: Alternating as they go.

01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:32.522
SAM: They we're playing that game.
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah!

01:22:32.522 --> 01:22:33.854
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:22:35.204 --> 01:22:36.284
Divination magic!

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.904
SAM: Does that game have a name?

01:22:38.904 --> 01:22:40.351
TRAVIS: Slaps.
LIAM: Slapsies.

01:22:40.351 --> 01:22:41.184
SAM: Slapsies?

01:22:41.184 --> 01:22:45.115
LAURA: But there's one that's like a circle.
ASHLEY: ♪ Down by the banks of the-- ♪

01:22:45.115 --> 01:22:47.424
SAM: Is there a circle order?

01:22:47.424 --> 01:22:49.612
TRAVIS: Okay, back to the D&amp;D campaign.

01:22:49.612 --> 01:22:52.054
(laughter)

01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:54.221
MATT: Necessary lore.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

01:22:55.214 --> 01:22:57.864
MARISHA: So, alternating palms up, palms down.

01:22:57.864 --> 01:23:00.244
TALIESIN: I'm keeping a very close eye on this, by the way.

01:23:00.244 --> 01:23:02.284
This is-- and including around us, too,

01:23:02.284 --> 01:23:04.384
to see if this is a trap.

01:23:04.384 --> 01:23:06.174
TRAVIS: First was an orc, and then to either side

01:23:06.174 --> 01:23:08.882
do we see what race they are?

01:23:09.882 --> 01:23:11.324
MATT: You see--
MARISHA: You mentioned halfling?

01:23:11.324 --> 01:23:13.054
MATT: There's a human.

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:13.901
There's an elf.

01:23:15.036 --> 01:23:16.619
There's a halfling.

01:23:17.644 --> 01:23:18.894
There's a gnome.

01:23:20.434 --> 01:23:22.704
LIAM: I could try to clear the space out.

01:23:22.704 --> 01:23:23.790
Amongst them, too.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.456
MARISHA: What was the last one you said?
MATT: Goliath.

01:23:25.456 --> 01:23:26.984
They're all of different races.

01:23:26.984 --> 01:23:29.204
They're all dressed similarly.

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.474
MARISHA: And you said there's seven of them?

01:23:30.474 --> 01:23:31.954
MATT: Seven of them, yes.

01:23:31.954 --> 01:23:34.194
MARISHA: Six, what was the last one?

01:23:34.194 --> 01:23:36.227
MATT: The last one would've been dwarf.

01:23:37.484 --> 01:23:39.884
MATT: So all different races.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:23:39.884 --> 01:23:42.964
LIAM: And how wide is the circle from one side to the other?

01:23:42.964 --> 01:23:46.204
MATT: Each of these statues roughly from where the hand ends

01:23:46.204 --> 01:23:47.934
is about three feet 'til the next one.

01:23:47.934 --> 01:23:49.514
So it's a fairly wide circle.

01:23:49.514 --> 01:23:52.414
LIAM: And then from two statues facing each other,

01:23:52.414 --> 01:23:55.314
what's the distance roughly between the two sides?

01:23:55.314 --> 01:23:59.080
MATT: Let me just do some quick math in my head here.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.654
LIAM: Guesstimate, guesstimate.

01:24:00.654 --> 01:24:03.744
MATT: Right, no. So it'd be, like, 15 or so feet.

01:24:03.744 --> 01:24:04.577
LIAM: Okay.

01:24:04.577 --> 01:24:06.802
TALIESIN: Keep a bit of distance, Jester--
MARISHA: In the center?

01:24:06.802 --> 01:24:09.519
LIAM: Yeah. We want to clear it out.
MARISHA: That's that's pretty big.

01:24:09.519 --> 01:24:12.654
LAURA: I think, maybe, should we not step in the circle?

01:24:12.654 --> 01:24:14.034
We shouldn't step in the middle of them.

01:24:14.034 --> 01:24:15.725
LIAM: Can't even see what's in there.

01:24:15.725 --> 01:24:17.114
TALIESIN: I feel like that's good advice in general.

01:24:17.114 --> 01:24:19.694
LAURA: Ooh! I wonder if we can melt the snow

01:24:19.694 --> 01:24:21.569
in the middle and see if we can see something.

01:24:21.569 --> 01:24:22.814
LIAM: That's what I'm saying, yeah.

01:24:22.814 --> 01:24:24.374
And take the snow out of the center.

01:24:24.374 --> 01:24:28.122
LAURA: Oh! I know. Cause I was totally
paying attention to what you were doing.

01:24:28.122 --> 01:24:30.019
MARISHA: While he does that,

01:24:30.019 --> 01:24:31.672
I'll get a closer look at the statues

01:24:31.672 --> 01:24:34.227
and see if they're carved or

01:24:35.294 --> 01:24:36.127
something else happened.

01:24:36.127 --> 01:24:38.026
MATT: Okay, so you begin to, from a distance--

01:24:38.026 --> 01:24:40.194
LIAM: Well, I am going to do something a little

01:24:40.194 --> 01:24:43.494
hot, so I will-- do you want to take a look at that first?

01:24:43.494 --> 01:24:44.327
MARISHA: Sure.

01:24:44.327 --> 01:24:46.202
LIAM: Or do you want me to clear them out first?

01:24:46.202 --> 01:24:47.837
MARISHA: Let me take a look first.
LIAM: Okay.

01:24:47.837 --> 01:24:49.711
MATT: Roll an investigation check for me with disadvantage.

01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:52.645
MARISHA: With disadvantage. That's what I thought.

01:24:52.645 --> 01:24:56.554
Okay. That is still a 22.

01:24:56.554 --> 01:24:58.154
MATT: Damn.

01:24:58.154 --> 01:25:01.044
Looking very closely at the details.

01:25:01.044 --> 01:25:02.874
They are detailed,

01:25:02.874 --> 01:25:05.594
but some of the edges, the lips, elements of them

01:25:05.594 --> 01:25:09.814
are still a bit rough. Which, with your experience

01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:12.474
both researching and actually witnessing creatures

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.854
that had been petrified, leads you to believe that

01:25:14.854 --> 01:25:17.434
these were actually crafted.

01:25:17.434 --> 01:25:19.056
LAURA: Oh wow.
MARISHA: Carved and crafted.

01:25:19.056 --> 01:25:21.289
MATT: Mm-hmm. Though--
LIAM: They're Michelangelos.

01:25:21.289 --> 01:25:23.689
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Though it's hard to tell

01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:25.144
how long ago,

01:25:25.144 --> 01:25:26.794
how recent.

01:25:26.794 --> 01:25:28.102
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Wow.

01:25:28.102 --> 01:25:31.544
MARISHA: So they're sculpted, and the fact that it's

01:25:32.384 --> 01:25:37.384
seven different races feels like some sort of unity...

01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:39.486
circle? Something like that.

01:25:39.486 --> 01:25:40.319
LIAM: Could be.

01:25:40.319 --> 01:25:44.794
ASHLEY: Do any of them look at all familiar?

01:25:45.804 --> 01:25:47.687
MATT: To you? No.

01:25:49.364 --> 01:25:51.614
Most of their faces are fairly blank.

01:25:52.489 --> 01:25:53.954
Just the eyes are open.

01:25:53.954 --> 01:25:55.684
And they're looking right across.

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:58.154
Their expression is neutral.

01:25:58.154 --> 01:26:01.224
And they're just arms out facing forward.

01:26:01.224 --> 01:26:03.687
Like some sort of odd courtyard decor.

01:26:04.796 --> 01:26:05.874
MARISHA: See what's in the center.

01:26:05.874 --> 01:26:09.299
LIAM: Back up everybody, just 20 or 30 feet, please.

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.105
And I will take a little bit of phosphorus and--

01:26:14.105 --> 01:26:15.544
LAURA: I'm going to back up more than 20 feet.

01:26:15.544 --> 01:26:18.404
LIAM: --push my hand through and then curve it

01:26:18.404 --> 01:26:21.554
and make a small, tight ring of

01:26:21.554 --> 01:26:23.874
walled fire in the center.

01:26:23.874 --> 01:26:26.544
MATT: Okay. (flames whooshing)

01:26:26.544 --> 01:26:28.064
This column of fire

01:26:28.064 --> 01:26:32.024
bursts out from the center of this statue circle.

01:26:32.024 --> 01:26:33.291
You watch as Dagen goes,

01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:35.541
"Oh shit!" And wheels back a bit,

01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:38.524
protecting his face, like, "That-- that was--

01:26:38.524 --> 01:26:40.174
"Sure, yeah, go for it, I guess.

01:26:40.174 --> 01:26:41.354
"Um."

01:26:41.354 --> 01:26:44.794
Within moments, the snow in the vicinity

01:26:44.794 --> 01:26:47.014
and even beyond the circle begins to just melt

01:26:47.014 --> 01:26:49.904
and turn to water and steam from the center.

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:51.874
You can see there's a column of steam that rises up

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:56.874
from the initial arrival of this burning wall of fire.

01:26:57.190 --> 01:26:58.734
Within a very short period of time,

01:26:58.734 --> 01:27:01.604
you've cleared the region of snow.

01:27:01.604 --> 01:27:03.454
You can see now the ground below.

01:27:03.454 --> 01:27:05.174
Which, it's been a while since you've seen

01:27:05.174 --> 01:27:10.174
a larger patch of just visibile turf.

01:27:10.574 --> 01:27:13.834
There is thick, muddy dirt that has become dry and cracked

01:27:13.834 --> 01:27:16.234
towards the center where all the moisture has burned away.

01:27:16.234 --> 01:27:21.217
You can see long decayed elements of gray grass and--

01:27:22.242 --> 01:27:24.429
If you want to roll a nature check for me, Caduceus.

01:27:24.429 --> 01:27:26.844
SAM: There's markings on the grass!

01:27:26.844 --> 01:27:28.994
"50-yard line"? What does that mean?

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:30.811
TALIESIN: That's a-- that's-- that's a one.

01:27:30.811 --> 01:27:32.361
MATT: That's a one.

01:27:32.361 --> 01:27:33.194
TALIESIN: Not a natural one, but.

01:27:33.194 --> 01:27:35.084
MATT: You have no idea what this grass is.

01:27:35.084 --> 01:27:37.124
You have no idea if it's alive or dead,

01:27:37.124 --> 01:27:39.125
but it's curious.
TALIESIN: My nature is a negative one anyway.

01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:40.366
I know how it works.
I don't know what it is.

01:27:40.366 --> 01:27:42.016
MATT: I was just curious.

01:27:42.016 --> 01:27:44.644
LIAM: I start looking about for sigils.

01:27:44.644 --> 01:27:46.174
MATT: What you do notice:

01:27:46.174 --> 01:27:49.124
in the center of the circle, there is a

01:27:49.124 --> 01:27:54.124
circular platform, about half a foot high.

01:27:54.234 --> 01:27:58.104
That has simple, circular markings around it.

01:27:58.104 --> 01:27:59.934
It looks like interesting designs

01:27:59.934 --> 01:28:02.604
that represent the seven points of each of these statues

01:28:02.604 --> 01:28:03.904
all meeting in the center.

01:28:05.516 --> 01:28:07.434
LAURA: What do you think it means, Caleb?

01:28:07.434 --> 01:28:08.834
Do you think if you stand in the middle of it

01:28:08.834 --> 01:28:12.404
you'll learn everything there is to know about the world?

01:28:12.404 --> 01:28:14.814
LIAM: Oh, one could hope. I should give it a try.

01:28:14.814 --> 01:28:16.937
I should jump right on top of it.

01:28:16.937 --> 01:28:19.349
I can-- is there any kind of--

01:28:21.834 --> 01:28:22.667
divination.

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:27.724
And I can't tell from years of study what its purpose is

01:28:27.724 --> 01:28:29.010
because it's too old?

01:28:30.254 --> 01:28:31.957
MATT: Roll a history check for me.

01:28:33.044 --> 01:28:34.991
MARISHA: Can I aid him?
MATT: With disadvantage.

01:28:34.991 --> 01:28:37.584
MARISHA: Can I aid him?
MATT: Sure. Just a straight roll.

01:28:37.584 --> 01:28:38.917
LIAM: Straight roll.

01:28:39.794 --> 01:28:41.664
MATT: Although this history--

01:28:41.664 --> 01:28:43.064
MARISHA: I'm good at histories.
MATT: I know.

01:28:43.064 --> 01:28:44.900
I'd say it'd be separate rolls as apposed to aiding,

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:45.884
because this is more of

01:28:45.884 --> 01:28:48.095
both of your individual knowledge.
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do a separate roll.

01:28:48.095 --> 01:28:50.809
MATT: So disadvantage for each of you.

01:28:50.809 --> 01:28:52.174
LIAM: Drat.

01:28:52.174 --> 01:28:55.245
LAURA: It was good the first time.
LIAM: It was fucking great.

01:28:55.245 --> 01:28:58.704
MARISHA: Oh! I tried, I'm sorry.

01:28:58.704 --> 01:29:00.987
LIAM: 16. Instead of a 28.

01:29:02.384 --> 01:29:04.044
MARISHA: Uh,

01:29:04.044 --> 01:29:05.061
27.

01:29:05.061 --> 01:29:05.960
TRAVIS: Ooh!
TALIESIN: Hey!

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:06.793
MATT: With disadvantage?

01:29:06.793 --> 01:29:10.163
MARISHA: I rolled two 13s and my history is a 14.

01:29:10.163 --> 01:29:11.217
TRAVIS: Oh!
MATT: That's pretty good.

01:29:11.217 --> 01:29:12.050
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:13.154
MATT: But not enough.

01:29:13.154 --> 01:29:15.588
MARISHA: What?!
LIAM: Whoa!

01:29:15.588 --> 01:29:17.358
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's one of those.

01:29:17.358 --> 01:29:18.544
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:29:18.544 --> 01:29:21.564
TRAVIS: You roll natural 20 and have a plus 10.

01:29:21.564 --> 01:29:22.454
Or whatever.

01:29:22.454 --> 01:29:25.267
MATT: Yeah, this was a DC 30.

01:29:25.267 --> 01:29:27.124
MARISHA: Oh!

01:29:27.124 --> 01:29:28.474
TRAVIS: Oh!
MATT: You have no idea what this is.

01:29:28.474 --> 01:29:30.073
TALIESIN: It's got a teleporter vibe.

01:29:30.073 --> 01:29:32.394
MATT: All you know is it has some essence, like,

01:29:32.394 --> 01:29:35.504
strong essence of divination from these statues.

01:29:35.504 --> 01:29:36.337
That's all you know.

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:39.007
LIAM: Yeah, probably not teleporting.

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:41.198
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Because they
were trying to glean something.

01:29:41.198 --> 01:29:44.054
TRAVIS: Well, even though they're
alternating, at some point,

01:29:44.054 --> 01:29:45.804
one of these is going to meet. Right?

01:29:45.804 --> 01:29:47.594
Because there's an odd number.

01:29:47.594 --> 01:29:49.421
MATT: You do notice, on one of the edges,

01:29:49.421 --> 01:29:51.511
there is one person whose one hand is face up

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:53.294
and one hand is face down. That completes the link.

01:29:53.294 --> 01:29:54.327
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:29:56.144 --> 01:29:57.454
LAURA: Maybe we should all stand behind them

01:29:57.454 --> 01:29:58.604
and do the same motion.

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:01.354
LIAM: Sure, why not?

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:03.484
TRAVIS: Well, why was the snow around them?

01:30:03.484 --> 01:30:05.664
The snow wasn't pressing against them. Right?

01:30:05.664 --> 01:30:07.404
LAURA: Yeah, they're warm statues.

01:30:07.404 --> 01:30:10.574
If we stand near the statue, does it feel warm?

01:30:10.574 --> 01:30:12.013
MATT: Immediate vicinity? No.

01:30:12.013 --> 01:30:13.186
MARISHA: If you touch it?

01:30:13.186 --> 01:30:15.254
LAURA: (gasps) You're going to touch one?

01:30:15.254 --> 01:30:16.294
TRAVIS: Do it.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:30:16.294 --> 01:30:17.127
MATT: You touch the statue?

01:30:17.127 --> 01:30:18.554
MARISHA: I touch one of the statues.

01:30:18.554 --> 01:30:19.387
MATT: Okay.

01:30:20.324 --> 01:30:21.344
You reach out,

01:30:21.344 --> 01:30:24.244
and as your fingers touch the exterior

01:30:24.244 --> 01:30:26.794
of the stone statue that's closet to you.

01:30:26.794 --> 01:30:27.754
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:30:27.754 --> 01:30:32.574
MATT: At first, you sense it does
have a strange warmth to it.

01:30:32.574 --> 01:30:34.299
MARISHA: Yeah. Warm.

01:30:34.299 --> 01:30:35.598
A little tingly.
MATT: And then,

01:30:37.375 --> 01:30:38.383
nothing.

01:30:38.383 --> 01:30:39.216
LAURA: (sighs)
TALIESIN: I knew it.

01:30:39.216 --> 01:30:40.199
TRAVIS: Let's just fucking do it.

01:30:40.199 --> 01:30:41.398
LAURA: You fucker.

01:30:41.398 --> 01:30:42.975
MARISHA: Just like a--
LAURA: I think we should do the thing.

01:30:42.975 --> 01:30:46.014
TRAVIS: It does have a strange warmth to it, though?

01:30:46.014 --> 01:30:47.664
MATT: A strange warmth to it, yeah.

01:30:47.664 --> 01:30:48.714
TALIESIN: Oh.
MARISHA: Oh.

01:30:48.714 --> 01:30:50.412
TALIESIN: Such an ulcer is happening.

01:30:50.412 --> 01:30:51.651
MARISHA: Let's do it, let's do it!

01:30:51.651 --> 01:30:53.783
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
MARISHA: Let's all stand.

01:30:53.783 --> 01:30:55.671
TRAVIS: That really feels like, you know--

01:30:55.671 --> 01:30:56.504
MARISHA: There's seven of us!

01:30:56.504 --> 01:31:00.379
TRAVIS: -- the college kids that
stumble upon the cult circle and, like,

01:31:00.379 --> 01:31:03.188
summoned Cthulhu. Okay.
MARISHA: Just read this passage!

01:31:03.188 --> 01:31:05.394
TALIESIN: I just really wish we weren't so tired.

01:31:05.394 --> 01:31:08.777
TRAVIS: Can we just do a 360 scan to see
if anybody's watching and they're like,

01:31:08.777 --> 01:31:11.969
"Oh my god, these fucking idiots are really going to do it!"

01:31:11.969 --> 01:31:13.694
MATT: Yeah. Dagen.

01:31:13.694 --> 01:31:15.261
Who is currently going,

01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:17.484
"Y'all have fun. I'm just going to back the fuck out

01:31:17.484 --> 01:31:18.434
"of this for a while."

01:31:18.434 --> 01:31:20.551
LAURA: Get ready to save us, Dagen, in case we die.

01:31:20.551 --> 01:31:22.444
MATT: "Sure, totally," and he pulls out some beef jerky

01:31:22.444 --> 01:31:24.183
and is like, "Keep going."

01:31:24.183 --> 01:31:26.837
TRAVIS: Yeah, we actually need Caduceus for this.

01:31:26.837 --> 01:31:28.147
SAM: Wait, are we all going in?

01:31:28.147 --> 01:31:29.050
TRAVIS: We're doing this?

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.260
LAURA: We're going to stand behind the statues

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.451
and do the same motion.
ASHLEY: We're going to do the--

01:31:31.451 --> 01:31:32.342
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:31:32.342 --> 01:31:33.325
TALIESIN: Terrible idea.

01:31:33.325 --> 01:31:35.803
LAURA: So we should find some, like, closest to our,

01:31:35.803 --> 01:31:37.304
like, that look like us and go for it.

01:31:37.304 --> 01:31:38.878
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll behind the human.

01:31:38.878 --> 01:31:41.750
TALIESIN: None of these look like me.
SAM: Doing the same thing, but behind the statues.

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:42.583
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:42.583 --> 01:31:44.916
SAM: So we'll be reaching slightly further.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.564
LIAM: I'll do whichever one is doing the splits.

01:31:46.564 --> 01:31:47.720
TALIESIN: You'll end up in half, so that--

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.352
TRAVIS: I'll take the orc.

01:31:49.352 --> 01:31:51.494
LAURA: I'll take-- is there
a tiefling? I'll do the tiefling.

01:31:51.494 --> 01:31:53.094
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: I'll take whatever's left over.

01:31:53.094 --> 01:31:55.547
MATT: I do not believe there's a tiefling in this.

01:31:55.547 --> 01:31:57.283
LAURA: What the fuck is this shit?

01:31:57.283 --> 01:31:58.410
Why isn't there a tiefling?

01:31:58.410 --> 01:31:59.454
TRAVIS: Take the elf.

01:31:59.454 --> 01:32:01.779
SAM: You can do the gnome or something.
LAURA: I'm not an elf! What?

01:32:01.779 --> 01:32:03.029
SAM: Do the gnome.

01:32:03.934 --> 01:32:05.591
LAURA: Okay, I'll do the gnome.
MATT: Okay.

01:32:05.591 --> 01:32:07.656
TALIESIN: I'll take the elf, then.
ASHLEY: I'll do the goliath.

01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:09.754
SAM: I'll do the halfling.
MATT: All righty.

01:32:09.754 --> 01:32:11.374
Okay.

01:32:11.374 --> 01:32:13.874
You all arrange yourselves behind the statues,

01:32:13.874 --> 01:32:15.467
matching the hand movements,

01:32:16.424 --> 01:32:20.923
as you all take the corresponding poses

01:32:20.923 --> 01:32:22.048
around these--

01:32:22.048 --> 01:32:23.617
(giggling)

01:32:23.617 --> 01:32:26.250
LAURA: Wait, we got to figure out. I got to get it right!

01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:27.654
SAM: Taliesin's wrong!
LAURA: Taliesin-- no!

01:32:27.654 --> 01:32:28.487
MARISHA: So like this.

01:32:28.487 --> 01:32:29.320
LAURA: Okay, wait.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.597
SAM: No wait! No, no, now, we're--
Something's wrong other there.

01:32:31.597 --> 01:32:35.130
ASHLEY: What's amazing about this is
no one can see what we're doing.

01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:37.509
LIAM: All our hands are off!

01:32:37.509 --> 01:32:40.094
SAM: Do it closer to our body! Closer to your body!

01:32:40.094 --> 01:32:41.976
TRAVIS: Wait, who's the intersection? Oh, you are.

01:32:41.976 --> 01:32:44.066
LAURA: It's easier like this.

01:32:44.066 --> 01:32:45.843
TRAVIS: You got to flip, you got to flip!
MARISHA: I got to be the splitsies.

01:32:45.843 --> 01:32:47.226
LIAM: Why?
TRAVIS: No, she's the split.

01:32:47.226 --> 01:32:48.567
LIAM: Why you got to be the split?
TRAVIS: You got to flip.

01:32:48.567 --> 01:32:50.175
LIAM: I already called dibs on splitsies.

01:32:50.175 --> 01:32:52.172
LAURA: You got to have two flips!
TRAVIS: Taliesin, you got to go up.

01:32:52.172 --> 01:32:53.005
TALIESIN: I got to go.

01:32:53.005 --> 01:32:55.574
SAM: If there's two, then there shouldn't be any flips.

01:32:55.574 --> 01:32:56.474
It should just be all--

01:32:56.474 --> 01:32:59.232
MATT: There are no flips, guys.
TRAVIS: Taliesin, you should be up.

01:32:59.232 --> 01:33:00.686
LIAM: You described one with one hand up, one hand down.

01:33:00.686 --> 01:33:02.434
SAM: He was wrong! There's no flips!

01:33:02.434 --> 01:33:03.708
MATT: Because I was told it was wrong,

01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:04.864
and I was like, "Oh right, there would be."

01:33:04.864 --> 01:33:05.724
But no, there isn't.

01:33:05.724 --> 01:33:06.934
LAURA: There's no flips!

01:33:06.934 --> 01:33:08.454
LIAM: Ah, okay.
MARISHA: There's no flips?

01:33:08.454 --> 01:33:09.804
MATT: I didn't think there would be, but then I thought--

01:33:09.804 --> 01:33:11.480
I thought you guys said that it wouldn't mix.

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.628
LIAM: Matt, why is your world invisible?

01:33:13.628 --> 01:33:14.944
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, there's seven, so, like.

01:33:14.944 --> 01:33:15.952
LIAM: You can't see it!
TRAVIS: At some point,

01:33:15.952 --> 01:33:17.589
there are two people with the same.

01:33:17.589 --> 01:33:19.414
LAURA: We'll do it, we'll showcase.

01:33:19.414 --> 01:33:21.859
MATT: No! With seven it should be complete.

01:33:21.859 --> 01:33:23.024
You make me second guess myself.

01:33:23.024 --> 01:33:27.037
You did it with the fucking archipelago in campaign one.

01:33:27.037 --> 01:33:28.645
And you did it again with this time.

01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:29.996
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Here we go.

01:33:29.996 --> 01:33:31.724
(laughter)

01:33:31.724 --> 01:33:33.516
LAURA: God, we're so dumb.

01:33:33.516 --> 01:33:36.380
(laughter)

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.734
LIAM: It's been a long day.

01:33:37.734 --> 01:33:40.444
Long week. Long month, long year.

01:33:40.444 --> 01:33:43.303
TRAVIS: Am I crazy? Seven.
LAURA: You-- I mean, you saw it!

01:33:43.303 --> 01:33:44.654
SAM: Yeah, do it again, everyone.

01:33:44.654 --> 01:33:45.954
LAURA: You do it! Do it! And we'll see.

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:47.836
MARISHA: So wait, I'm going to do like this--
LAURA: You start!

01:33:47.836 --> 01:33:48.829
MARISHA: I'll go up.
MATT: I was like,

01:33:48.829 --> 01:33:50.294
"Seven, that'll complete the circle."

01:33:50.294 --> 01:33:53.414
LAURA: Okay, then Yasha.
MATT: Then you make me second guess myself.

01:33:53.414 --> 01:33:55.754
LIAM: Well, if weren't all going to die before, we are now.

01:33:55.754 --> 01:33:57.844
MARISHA: Okay, do it. Do it, Liam!

01:33:57.844 --> 01:33:59.999
LIAM: Wait, you guys are doing the same thing!

01:33:59.999 --> 01:34:01.348
LAURA: Oh!
LIAM: They're matching!

01:34:01.348 --> 01:34:02.998
LAURA: Oh, right! So there is a flippy.

01:34:02.998 --> 01:34:04.739
TRAVIS: There is a flippy.
SAM: No, no, no. Liam--

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:07.213
TRAVIS: You need even numbers to be a circuit,

01:34:07.213 --> 01:34:08.771
and odd is going to need a--

01:34:08.771 --> 01:34:10.480
LAURA: Okay, so-- oh.
ASHLEY: Okay, let's start!

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.214
Liam.
(laughter)

01:34:12.214 --> 01:34:13.160
LAURA: You can be the flippy!

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.184
ASHLEY: You called flippy first.

01:34:14.184 --> 01:34:15.474
MARISHA: Okay, we'll go from there.

01:34:15.474 --> 01:34:18.140
LIAM: Base it off the person next to you.

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:20.169
MARISHA: Okay!
LAURA: Oh hey, we did it!

01:34:20.169 --> 01:34:21.366
TRAVIS: We got a flippy.

01:34:21.366 --> 01:34:22.684
MATT: Where did you guys fuck up?

01:34:22.684 --> 01:34:24.944
And I'm sorry I fucked up, too, on that one.

01:34:24.944 --> 01:34:26.504
But then I corrected it, but then you made me--

01:34:26.504 --> 01:34:27.337
never mind!

01:34:27.337 --> 01:34:28.541
That was--
TALIESIN: I know where we fucked up.

01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:30.934
MATT: How?
TRAVIS: Even numbers are a circuit, odd numbers,

01:34:30.934 --> 01:34:32.474
there needs to be a circuit--

01:34:32.474 --> 01:34:34.216
MATT: Right!
TRAVIS: Or a breaker.

01:34:36.057 --> 01:34:36.890
MATT: Don't-- that--

01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:39.014
TRAVIS: Basic engineering, Matt. Come on.

01:34:39.014 --> 01:34:40.894
TRAVIS: I just drew it.
MATT: Don't yell at me!

01:34:40.894 --> 01:34:42.354
You're the guys who fucked it up the first time

01:34:42.354 --> 01:34:44.424
you did the circle, and made me second guess myself.

01:34:44.424 --> 01:34:46.649
TALIESIN: I love that it's been, like, five minutes of us

01:34:46.649 --> 01:34:48.816
trying to just match the statues.

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:51.264
LIAM: I know there are people at NASA who watch this show,

01:34:51.264 --> 01:34:52.714
but they're going to stop now.

01:34:52.714 --> 01:34:55.494
(laughter)

01:34:55.494 --> 01:34:57.244
MATT: God fucking damn it. All right.

01:34:57.244 --> 01:35:00.094
LAURA: And everyone will forget, just keep going.

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:00.927
(laughter)

01:35:00.927 --> 01:35:02.797
MATT: This-- this, guys.
MARISHA: We did it.

01:35:04.744 --> 01:35:05.706
MATT: Well done.

01:35:05.706 --> 01:35:07.794
(laughter)

01:35:07.794 --> 01:35:09.374
LAURA: This is what we were supposed to do, right?

01:35:09.374 --> 01:35:13.244
MATT: As you all stand there, and match then hand motions

01:35:13.244 --> 01:35:14.944
of each of these statues,

01:35:14.944 --> 01:35:16.854
you look at each other,

01:35:16.854 --> 01:35:20.208
and in a moment of quiet, you hear--

01:35:20.208 --> 01:35:22.154
(clapping)

01:35:22.154 --> 01:35:24.657
"Y'all did it! You look great!"

01:35:24.657 --> 01:35:27.224
(laughter)

01:35:28.477 --> 01:35:29.543
LAURA: All right, all right.

01:35:29.543 --> 01:35:31.328
ASHLEY: I really thought that was going to do something.

01:35:31.328 --> 01:35:32.174
LAURA: I did, too!
TALIESIN: I didn't.

01:35:32.174 --> 01:35:33.948
MARISHA: I mean.
SAM: Did anyone stand in the middle?

01:35:33.948 --> 01:35:35.606
TRAVIS: Nope.
LAURA: No, I'm scared to!

01:35:35.606 --> 01:35:37.653
SAM: We should do that.
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll go stand in the middle.

01:35:37.653 --> 01:35:39.936
(exclamations)

01:35:39.936 --> 01:35:40.842
TRAVIS: Do it! Do it!

01:35:40.842 --> 01:35:42.197
MARISHA: Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:35:42.197 --> 01:35:43.925
ASHLEY: No! Look at his face!

01:35:43.925 --> 01:35:44.948
MATT: What?!
(laughter)

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:47.290
TRAVIS: "Look at his face!"

01:35:47.290 --> 01:35:48.673
SAM: Do it!
ASHLEY: All right, I'll go stand in the middle.

01:35:48.673 --> 01:35:51.944
TRAVIS: Boulder, Parchment, Shears.
First loses goes.

01:35:51.944 --> 01:35:52.814
MATT: All right.

01:35:52.814 --> 01:35:54.939
LIAM: Wait, just one last thing, quickie!

01:35:54.939 --> 01:35:57.872
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: I cast Identify on one statue.

01:35:57.872 --> 01:35:59.955
LAURA: Oh, that's smart. That's good, yeah, yeah.

01:35:59.955 --> 01:36:02.108
ASHLEY: I think that's a better idea
than just jumping right into the middle.

01:36:02.108 --> 01:36:03.594
MATT: Okay.

01:36:03.594 --> 01:36:05.714
You cast Identify on it.

01:36:05.714 --> 01:36:10.664
It gives you a strong divination response,

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:12.617
but there's something

01:36:14.164 --> 01:36:16.405
oddly esoteric and undefinable,

01:36:16.405 --> 01:36:20.154
oddly esoteric and undefinable,

01:36:20.154 --> 01:36:22.494
beyond the simple magic of an Identify spell.

01:36:22.494 --> 01:36:26.574
LIAM: And does it feel older than Halas' halls?

01:36:26.574 --> 01:36:28.054
SAM: Holes?
MATT: It feels old.

01:36:28.054 --> 01:36:29.904
LIAM: His holes.
MATT: It certainly feels old.

01:36:29.904 --> 01:36:31.800
It's old magic.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.962
TRAVIS: It would really suck if
this was, like, sealing something away.

01:36:34.962 --> 01:36:36.661
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
LIAM: It's not, though.

01:36:36.661 --> 01:36:39.564
MARISHA: It's divination, so it's got to be seeing.

01:36:39.564 --> 01:36:43.134
ASHLEY: Is there anything between-- between--

01:36:43.134 --> 01:36:44.873
LIAM: I roll Frumpkin into the circle.

01:36:44.873 --> 01:36:48.749
LAURA: Oh, come on! We were Boulder, Parchment, Shears-ing!

01:36:48.749 --> 01:36:50.414
SAM: Is is a three-way Boulder, Parchment?

01:36:50.414 --> 01:36:51.902
LIAM: I already did it.

01:36:51.902 --> 01:36:53.965
ASHLEY: We're doing Boulder, Parchment, Shears?
MATT: Frumpkin stands in the middle.

01:36:53.965 --> 01:36:55.406
LIAM: Yeah?

01:36:55.406 --> 01:36:56.423
TRAVIS: Cool.
MATT: Nothing.

01:36:56.423 --> 01:36:57.625
TRAVIS: Who are the three?

01:36:57.625 --> 01:36:58.858
LAURA: It was me, and Yasha, and Beau.

01:36:58.858 --> 01:37:01.228
ASHLEY: Okay, ready?

01:37:01.228 --> 01:37:03.632
Boulder, parchment, shears.

01:37:03.632 --> 01:37:04.978
MARISHA: Fuck, we did it again!

01:37:04.978 --> 01:37:06.912
(laughter)

01:37:06.912 --> 01:37:08.675
TRAVIS: That's hard to do.
MARISHA: God damn!

01:37:08.675 --> 01:37:10.942
TRAVIS: Go again.
MARISHA: All right, okay, okay, okay.

01:37:10.942 --> 01:37:13.220
ASHLEY: Boulder, parchment, shears.

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.778
LAURA: Oh, I win!
MARISHA: You win?

01:37:14.778 --> 01:37:15.884
LAURA: Wait, does that mean I lose?

01:37:15.884 --> 01:37:16.717
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:16.717 --> 01:37:18.575
ASHLEY: That means you go in the circle.

01:37:18.575 --> 01:37:20.494
TALIESIN: Quick Resistance popped on you.

01:37:20.494 --> 01:37:21.577
LAURA: Thanks, bud!

01:37:21.577 --> 01:37:22.634
TALIESIN: That's all I got.

01:37:22.634 --> 01:37:23.884
LIAM: Oh boy.

01:37:23.884 --> 01:37:24.874
MATT: All right.

01:37:24.874 --> 01:37:27.959
LAURA: I'll trepidatiously walk towards the center,

01:37:27.959 --> 01:37:30.334
and stand up on the pillar. Thingy.

01:37:30.334 --> 01:37:33.421
LIAM: Caleb's holding 17 components and is like--

01:37:33.421 --> 01:37:34.940
(laughter)

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:35.773
TALIESIN: You know--

01:37:35.773 --> 01:37:38.249
MATT: So you stand up onto the platform.

01:37:39.934 --> 01:37:41.434
TALIESIN: And a Death Ward.

01:37:41.434 --> 01:37:42.823
LAURA: Okay, good.

01:37:42.823 --> 01:37:44.047
MATT: You look about,

01:37:45.044 --> 01:37:46.994
and for a moment, you're like,

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.444
nothing's working.

01:37:50.424 --> 01:37:52.494
And then you look at the statue ahead of you,

01:37:52.494 --> 01:37:53.844
and

01:37:53.844 --> 01:37:55.724
you feel like it's looking at you.

01:37:55.724 --> 01:37:58.365
And you look at the other one immediate left to it,

01:37:58.365 --> 01:38:00.954
and you feel like they're all looking at you.

01:38:00.954 --> 01:38:01.787
And

01:38:03.434 --> 01:38:06.937
language doesn't enter you mind, but

01:38:10.144 --> 01:38:15.144
thoughts, voices mingling,

01:38:15.543 --> 01:38:18.117
(whispered voices)

01:38:18.117 --> 01:38:22.884
and the sense of what it seems to reach out to you is,

01:38:25.789 --> 01:38:28.266
"Do you give to receive?"

01:38:29.876 --> 01:38:30.709
SAM: Ooh.

01:38:33.594 --> 01:38:34.610
MATT: "Ask,

01:38:35.594 --> 01:38:36.865
"and we take."

01:38:36.865 --> 01:38:38.388
LAURA: (gasps)

01:38:39.454 --> 01:38:41.565
LIAM: "Ask and we take"?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:38:41.565 --> 01:38:42.765
LAURA: (exhales)

01:38:46.024 --> 01:38:48.095
Do I feel like I can step off of the circle?

01:38:48.095 --> 01:38:49.606
SAM: (whispers) That was a question!

01:38:49.606 --> 01:38:50.994
MATT: Right now,

01:38:50.994 --> 01:38:52.734
you cannot move.

01:38:52.734 --> 01:38:54.074
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:38:54.074 --> 01:38:56.704
MATT: You are locked into the attention

01:38:56.704 --> 01:38:59.517
of whatever this is.

01:39:01.204 --> 01:39:02.695
And they are waiting.

01:39:03.844 --> 01:39:06.574
LAURA: Oh shit, I need to think of a question.

01:39:08.994 --> 01:39:11.121
ASHLEY: (whispering) "Ask and we take"?

01:39:12.746 --> 01:39:13.894
MARISHA: "We take--"

01:39:13.894 --> 01:39:16.234
LAURA: Oh no, I can't ask anybody for help

01:39:16.234 --> 01:39:17.694
right now, can I?

01:39:17.694 --> 01:39:19.224
LIAM: None of us heard any of that, right?

01:39:19.224 --> 01:39:21.974
MATT: No, you just watched Jester step in the middle there.

01:39:23.441 --> 01:39:25.607
LAURA: Oh no.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:39:25.607 --> 01:39:26.790
LAURA: Oh no.

01:39:31.017 --> 01:39:35.775
MATT: (whispered voices)

01:39:38.266 --> 01:39:39.477
LAURA: What...

01:39:41.319 --> 01:39:45.364
what are the Tomb Takers trying to bring back?

01:39:50.394 --> 01:39:53.103
MATT: All their eyes begin to glow--

01:39:53.103 --> 01:39:56.066
MARISHA: (gasps)
MATT: --and suddenly imagery fills your mind.

01:39:57.364 --> 01:40:02.364
Familiar imagery of a living city.

01:40:02.654 --> 01:40:05.694
Flexing and shifting.

01:40:05.694 --> 01:40:10.464
You see this odd architecture, both ancient, but

01:40:11.484 --> 01:40:14.634
beautiful and alien in ways you've never really seen,

01:40:14.634 --> 01:40:18.964
except for glimpses of the first excavation you saw.

01:40:18.964 --> 01:40:23.952
You see imagery of this massive,

01:40:23.952 --> 01:40:27.074
flexing, in some ways still in stone,

01:40:27.074 --> 01:40:29.077
in some ways flesh and breathing,

01:40:30.474 --> 01:40:33.964
city-ship entity,

01:40:33.964 --> 01:40:38.052
gliding through the astral expanse.

01:40:41.614 --> 01:40:45.794
And you sense the Tomb Takers trudging through the snow,

01:40:46.944 --> 01:40:51.257
satchels half-full with necessary gathered components.

01:40:53.434 --> 01:40:55.589
And the devious intent leading them.

01:40:57.335 --> 01:40:58.174
(quick whooshing)

01:40:58.174 --> 01:41:00.344
Your vision comes back to you,

01:41:00.344 --> 01:41:02.794
and just as you gather your thoughts, all of a sudden--

01:41:02.794 --> 01:41:03.977
(sucking inhale)

01:41:03.977 --> 01:41:05.652
You feel

01:41:05.652 --> 01:41:07.604
something being pulled from you,

01:41:07.604 --> 01:41:11.595
some odd cold

01:41:11.595 --> 01:41:14.245
takes grasp inside the center of you chest,

01:41:14.245 --> 01:41:16.294
in your soul, in your spirit

01:41:16.294 --> 01:41:17.344
and you fall to your knees

01:41:17.344 --> 01:41:19.591
and starting coughing uncontrollably.

01:41:19.591 --> 01:41:21.224
LAURA: (coughs)

01:41:21.224 --> 01:41:26.207
MATT: Then you stand up, and a little winded, but--

01:41:27.898 --> 01:41:28.731
but you're okay.

01:41:28.731 --> 01:41:30.652
TRAVIS: We run to Jester.
MARISHA: Jess? Yeah, I rush over.

01:41:30.652 --> 01:41:31.711
SAM: What happened? What happened?
MARISHA: I grab her.

01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:32.544
TRAVIS: You okay?

01:41:32.544 --> 01:41:33.976
LIAM: What happened? What happened in there?

01:41:33.976 --> 01:41:37.054
LAURA: They're bringing, the Tomb Takers,

01:41:37.054 --> 01:41:38.604
they're bringing back the city.

01:41:41.252 --> 01:41:42.310
The bad city.

01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:44.917
TRAVIS: How did-- how do you know that?

01:41:44.917 --> 01:41:47.503
LAURA: I don't know, the statues told me.

01:41:47.503 --> 01:41:49.431
SAM: They just told you that? How do they know?

01:41:49.431 --> 01:41:52.747
LAURA: I don't know, they said give something, and--

01:41:53.864 --> 01:41:56.524
and they'll give me something in return.

01:41:56.524 --> 01:41:58.466
ASHLEY: What did you give?
LAURA: I don't know!

01:41:58.466 --> 01:41:59.971
TALIESIN: Have the statues changed?

01:41:59.971 --> 01:42:01.370
MATT: No.
MARISHA: How are you feeling?

01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:03.170
LIAM: Yeah, you all right?
LAURA: How do I feel?

01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:04.924
SAM: Do magic or something.

01:42:04.924 --> 01:42:06.024
Do a cantrip.

01:42:06.024 --> 01:42:08.191
LAURA: Well, I want to get away
from this circle first, okay?

01:42:08.191 --> 01:42:09.554
MARISHA: Yeah, let's--
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:09.554 --> 01:42:11.224
LIAM: We walk a ways away.

01:42:11.224 --> 01:42:12.584
Come over here.

01:42:12.584 --> 01:42:15.228
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try and do spell or something.

01:42:15.228 --> 01:42:17.503
LIAM: Start simple.
TRAVIS: Did we see the eyes glow?

01:42:17.503 --> 01:42:19.024
MATT: Mm-mm.

01:42:19.024 --> 01:42:20.574
LAURA: I'm going to try to just, um,

01:42:21.724 --> 01:42:24.654
do a-a-a Sacred Flame.

01:42:24.654 --> 01:42:26.020
MATT: Okay. (flame whooshing)

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.464
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.
MATT: It happens.

01:42:27.464 --> 01:42:28.297
LAURA: That's good.

01:42:28.297 --> 01:42:30.107
ASHLEY: How do you feel? Do you feel okay?

01:42:30.107 --> 01:42:32.405
LAURA: Yeah, it felt like something

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:37.144
cold left me. But I don't know what it was.

01:42:38.447 --> 01:42:40.044
MATT: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

01:42:40.044 --> 01:42:41.984
MATT: Beauregard.
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:42:41.984 --> 01:42:44.592
MATT: Pretty decent passive perception.

01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:47.064
I mean, you all look tired. You're all exhausted.

01:42:47.064 --> 01:42:50.724
This journey's been tough physically.

01:42:50.724 --> 01:42:53.344
There's something about Jester that just

01:42:53.344 --> 01:42:56.452
looks a little more, I don't know,

01:42:56.452 --> 01:42:57.618
mature.

01:42:59.956 --> 01:43:01.906
LAURA: (sadly) Oh!
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:43:03.548 --> 01:43:04.734
MARISHA: Like--

01:43:04.734 --> 01:43:05.567
LIAM: She looks older?

01:43:05.567 --> 01:43:07.943
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
MARISHA: Older? Or just like

01:43:07.943 --> 01:43:10.314
she's seen some shit?
MATT: A little older.

01:43:10.314 --> 01:43:12.386
TALIESIN: I think they--

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:14.602
I'm just going to get right up.

01:43:16.254 --> 01:43:18.024
SAM: You smell a little.

01:43:18.024 --> 01:43:20.049
LAURA: Fuck you!
SAM: Well, just, like, a little--

01:43:20.049 --> 01:43:21.989
MARISHA: Yeah, like Noxzema.

01:43:21.989 --> 01:43:25.854
(laughter)

01:43:25.854 --> 01:43:28.587
SAM: Like moth balls.
TALIESIN: Have her horns changed at all?

01:43:28.587 --> 01:43:29.954
Have her horns changed at all?

01:43:29.954 --> 01:43:32.157
MATT: They've grown a little bit longer, yeah.

01:43:33.154 --> 01:43:34.904
LAURA: What is it?

01:43:34.904 --> 01:43:37.544
TALIESIN: I think they took some of your life away.

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:38.974
MARISHA: They took time.

01:43:38.974 --> 01:43:40.050
LAURA: How much?

01:43:40.911 --> 01:43:42.804
How much time?

01:43:42.804 --> 01:43:44.464
MARISHA: Not a lot.

01:43:44.464 --> 01:43:45.464
TALIESIN: I mean,

01:43:46.504 --> 01:43:48.362
enough that I can see it.

01:43:49.933 --> 01:43:53.354
MARISHA: Like when you see an old friend a few years later.

01:43:53.354 --> 01:43:54.474
And it's been a bit.

01:43:54.474 --> 01:43:56.226
SAM: "It's me, Tony!"

01:43:56.226 --> 01:43:58.478
(laughter)

01:43:58.478 --> 01:44:01.814
LAURA: How's my face look?
Are my cheekbones more pronounced?

01:44:01.814 --> 01:44:03.334
My mama always said as I got older

01:44:03.334 --> 01:44:05.884
I would have more pronounced cheekbones.

01:44:05.884 --> 01:44:07.359
LIAM: You look excellent.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:44:07.359 --> 01:44:08.566
MATT: And yeah, I mean--

01:44:08.566 --> 01:44:11.083
TALIESIN: About a year or two, is that what it looks like?

01:44:11.083 --> 01:44:13.119
MATT: A little more than that.

01:44:13.119 --> 01:44:15.427
You'd say, estimate, between 4 or 5 years.

01:44:15.427 --> 01:44:16.654
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:44:16.654 --> 01:44:18.267
MARISHA: Wow.
LAURA: Holy shit.

01:44:19.351 --> 01:44:21.994
MARISHA: You're, like, a tiefling, and

01:44:21.994 --> 01:44:25.173
they've got a little extra time, right?

01:44:25.173 --> 01:44:27.064
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:44:27.064 --> 01:44:29.114
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine.

01:44:29.114 --> 01:44:30.084
MARISHA: Okay.

01:44:30.084 --> 01:44:31.034
LAURA: It's no big deal.

01:44:32.914 --> 01:44:33.747
Wow.

01:44:34.983 --> 01:44:36.733
MARISHA: Well, we have some confirmations.

01:44:37.714 --> 01:44:40.454
LAURA: That was worth it.
That knowledge was worth it, right?

01:44:40.454 --> 01:44:43.654
Now we know beyond all certainty

01:44:43.654 --> 01:44:46.864
that we need to stop the Tomb Takers.

01:44:46.864 --> 01:44:49.504
I mean, I know we knew it, we knew we needed to, but

01:44:49.504 --> 01:44:50.704
now we know we needed to.

01:44:50.704 --> 01:44:52.717
LIAM: Is there anything worth--

01:44:53.574 --> 01:44:55.054
ASHLEY: Knowing?
LIAM: -- asking still?

01:44:55.054 --> 01:44:56.964
SAM: We could ask what's at A2?

01:44:56.964 --> 01:44:58.461
TRAVIS: How do we stop Molly?

01:44:58.461 --> 01:45:02.592
LAURA: You guys are-- worth losing five years of your life?

01:45:02.592 --> 01:45:04.675
MATT: "Uh, um,

01:45:04.675 --> 01:45:06.134
"what all'd you do?"

01:45:06.134 --> 01:45:08.433
SAM: Oh! Yeah, Dagen! Dagen could go!

01:45:08.433 --> 01:45:09.308
(laughter)

01:45:09.308 --> 01:45:11.394
MATT: "No, I mean, what all you'd do?" And he points.

01:45:11.394 --> 01:45:13.644
He points back in the opening.

01:45:13.644 --> 01:45:14.482
And they're gone.

01:45:14.482 --> 01:45:15.423
(gasping)

01:45:15.423 --> 01:45:17.804
In the conversation you guys were having about this,

01:45:17.804 --> 01:45:20.242
the moment you all took your eyes off of it,

01:45:21.484 --> 01:45:22.762
the circle has vanished.

01:45:22.762 --> 01:45:24.754
MARISHA: (gasps) Whoa!

01:45:24.754 --> 01:45:26.784
LAURA: I'm sorry, I hope my question was good enough.

01:45:26.784 --> 01:45:28.311
LIAM: No, that is an excellent question.

01:45:28.311 --> 01:45:29.664
TRAVIS: You did great.

01:45:29.664 --> 01:45:31.374
LIAM: I mean, you were winging it.

01:45:31.374 --> 01:45:32.904
TRAVIS: Did it hurt?

01:45:32.904 --> 01:45:34.351
LAURA: I mean, it, eh--

01:45:34.351 --> 01:45:37.697
it made me cough. It felt, like, empty for a second.

01:45:38.574 --> 01:45:40.287
But I feel kind of normal now.

01:45:41.694 --> 01:45:43.474
TRAVIS: That was a hell of a question, with--

01:45:43.474 --> 01:45:45.197
TALIESIN: It felt, it felt,--
TRAVIS: -- with no warning.

01:45:46.683 --> 01:45:48.599
LAURA: (sighs) Wow.

01:45:48.599 --> 01:45:49.857
TALIESIN: How did it feel?

01:45:51.067 --> 01:45:51.900
LAURA: You know, like,

01:45:54.577 --> 01:45:55.607
like cold.

01:45:55.607 --> 01:45:57.437
You know that moment in The Little Mermaid

01:45:57.437 --> 01:45:58.467
when Ariel's singing

01:45:58.467 --> 01:46:01.287
and she loses-- it's like that.
SAM: We all know it well.

01:46:01.287 --> 01:46:02.637
TALIESIN: I don't know that at all.

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:05.123
I thought you said you--
TRAVIS: Ursula's a bitch.

01:46:05.123 --> 01:46:06.540
TALIESIN: -- felt empty for a moment.

01:46:07.507 --> 01:46:08.607
LAURA: I did.
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:46:08.607 --> 01:46:10.187
LAURA: For a second.

01:46:10.187 --> 01:46:11.020
TALIESIN: Huh, okay.

01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:15.436
ASHLEY: Is that something that can be reversed?

01:46:15.436 --> 01:46:16.736
TRAVIS: Now I've got her voice!

01:46:16.736 --> 01:46:17.753
LAURA: I don't--

01:46:17.753 --> 01:46:19.145
TALIESIN: I think when you...

01:46:20.937 --> 01:46:23.310
when you buy something, you pay for it.

01:46:24.407 --> 01:46:28.157
LIAM: Also, she looks fine.

01:46:28.157 --> 01:46:30.417
We've all seen her mother, I mean.

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.095
TALIESIN: You actually-- you look pretty good.

01:46:32.095 --> 01:46:34.417
LIAM: She is stunn-- your mother is a beautiful woman.

01:46:34.417 --> 01:46:36.467
You're a beautiful woman, she's...

01:46:36.467 --> 01:46:38.777
TALIESIN: Sharpen that a little bit, it's nice.

01:46:38.777 --> 01:46:39.997
MATT: Caleb, you would know in your studies

01:46:39.997 --> 01:46:42.377
that there are ways to reverse

01:46:42.377 --> 01:46:46.777
such powerful ancient magical aging to that degree.

01:46:46.777 --> 01:46:51.255
But that magic is extremely powerful and extremely rare.

01:46:54.089 --> 01:46:56.403
LAURA: It was worth it.

01:46:56.403 --> 01:46:57.236
MARISHA: Okay.

01:46:59.457 --> 01:47:01.230
And the Tomb Takers are halfway.

01:47:02.087 --> 01:47:02.987
TALIESIN: Better move.

01:47:04.317 --> 01:47:08.653
MATT: It's interesting.
As you play over the vision in the head of--

01:47:08.653 --> 01:47:10.078
Beyond just--

01:47:12.928 --> 01:47:15.553
Beyond just them traveling,

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:21.537
the visions of them carrying many things, not specifically,

01:47:21.537 --> 01:47:25.817
but you saw them gather one threshold crest

01:47:25.817 --> 01:47:27.977
from where you encountered them,

01:47:27.977 --> 01:47:32.864
but from what you were shown, you sense that

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:38.037
they were bearing numerous things amongst them.

01:47:38.037 --> 01:47:39.459
SAM: Bearing, not burying.

01:47:39.459 --> 01:47:40.292
MATT: Bearing.

01:47:40.292 --> 01:47:43.197
LAURA: Did it seem like when I saw it, that was the future

01:47:43.197 --> 01:47:46.777
or that was what was happening now?

01:47:46.777 --> 01:47:47.967
MATT: Seemed current.

01:47:47.967 --> 01:47:49.587
LAURA: Current. Wow.

01:47:49.587 --> 01:47:51.687
How'd they get so much stuff so quickly?

01:47:52.737 --> 01:47:56.907
MARISHA: Maybe, well, I mean, we saw a vision

01:47:56.907 --> 01:48:01.007
of Molly when we were still outside of Zadash.

01:48:01.007 --> 01:48:02.927
SAM: But also what did you ask?

01:48:02.927 --> 01:48:04.950
You asked what do they want, right?

01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:06.641
LAURA: I said, "What are they trying to bring back?"

01:48:06.641 --> 01:48:09.397
SAM: So that it showed you what they are trying to do.

01:48:09.397 --> 01:48:11.717
So maybe they haven't succeeded.

01:48:11.717 --> 01:48:13.807
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think they have.

01:48:13.807 --> 01:48:15.787
They're on their way there.

01:48:15.787 --> 01:48:17.657
MARISHA: But this does answer the question that

01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:19.697
they're not just looking for threshold crests.

01:48:19.697 --> 01:48:20.828
They're looking for--

01:48:20.828 --> 01:48:22.494
TALIESIN: Lots of things.
MARISHA: Lots of things.

01:48:22.494 --> 01:48:24.460
Probably anything holding some

01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:26.697
of this ancient, archaic energy.

01:48:26.697 --> 01:48:28.762
TALIESIN: Whatever's holding the city back.

01:48:28.762 --> 01:48:29.747
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:48:29.747 --> 01:48:31.017
TALIESIN: I don't even necessarily know

01:48:31.017 --> 01:48:33.227
if they know what they're calling.

01:48:33.227 --> 01:48:34.317
I didn't get the--

01:48:34.317 --> 01:48:36.207
LIAM: Well, yes, as we discussed--
TALIESIN: -- feeling that they

01:48:36.207 --> 01:48:37.687
really thought about this.

01:48:37.687 --> 01:48:39.717
LIAM: Are they pawns? Or are they more?

01:48:39.717 --> 01:48:41.497
TALIESIN: And will they listen to reason?

01:48:41.497 --> 01:48:43.197
MARISHA: They believe they're going home.

01:48:45.797 --> 01:48:49.807
You ever stood between anybody when they think, convinced,

01:48:49.807 --> 01:48:52.966
that they're going home, their real home?

01:48:52.966 --> 01:48:54.671
TALIESIN: Yes.
MARISHA: It's not pretty.

01:48:54.671 --> 01:48:56.611
TALIESIN: No.

01:48:56.611 --> 01:48:58.507
No, it's not.

01:48:58.507 --> 01:49:00.507
LAURA: Are they spying on us right now, Fjord?

01:49:01.443 --> 01:49:03.794
TRAVIS: I don't think I still have up--

01:49:03.794 --> 01:49:07.136
I'll summon the sword and use See Invisibility.

01:49:07.136 --> 01:49:08.988
MATT: Because it has been an additional day, yeah.

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:12.387
Glancing about the moment, you don't see anything.

01:49:12.387 --> 01:49:13.537
Make a perception check.

01:49:14.817 --> 01:49:16.334
LAURA: At disadvantage.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:49:16.334 --> 01:49:17.167
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:49:18.366 --> 01:49:19.282
(unhappy) Oh.

01:49:19.282 --> 01:49:20.607
(laughter)

01:49:20.607 --> 01:49:21.623
Eight.

01:49:21.623 --> 01:49:23.273
MATT: Yeah. Don't see anything.

01:49:24.197 --> 01:49:27.280
SAM: Maybe now you'll get, like,

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.755
different targeted ads,

01:49:28.755 --> 01:49:33.755
like mortgage refinancing and, like, Peloton and stuff

01:49:33.967 --> 01:49:35.277
now, instead of--

01:49:35.277 --> 01:49:38.132
LAURA: That's a good point.
I was getting kind of bored with the old ones.

01:49:38.132 --> 01:49:40.304
SAM: Yeah, of course.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you look beautiful.

01:49:40.304 --> 01:49:41.687
You don't look that much different to me.

01:49:41.687 --> 01:49:44.207
I just don't like you're losing time.

01:49:44.207 --> 01:49:46.867
LAURA: It's okay.
TRAVIS: Just as long as that's all.

01:49:46.867 --> 01:49:48.878
TALIESIN: This is good.

01:49:48.878 --> 01:49:51.890
This is helpful, I think.

01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:54.726
ASHLEY: We should also talk to Vess.

01:49:54.726 --> 01:49:56.237
TALIESIN: We are moving.

01:49:56.237 --> 01:49:57.337
TRAVIS: We should get going.

01:49:58.874 --> 01:50:02.447
MATT: (as Dagen) "All right, y'all
find what you're looking for?"

01:50:02.447 --> 01:50:03.880
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:50:04.988 --> 01:50:05.988
MATT: "All right.

01:50:07.303 --> 01:50:08.657
"I haven't met a group so eager to

01:50:08.657 --> 01:50:10.007
"poke the badger before."

01:50:10.007 --> 01:50:11.697
Then he starts making his way

01:50:11.697 --> 01:50:13.577
on where the path you were taking.

01:50:13.577 --> 01:50:15.609
TALIESIN: Some badgers need poking.
LAURA: ♪ Making its way on ♪

01:50:15.609 --> 01:50:17.642
(laughter)

01:50:18.867 --> 01:50:20.067
MATT: But beyond that,

01:50:20.067 --> 01:50:23.037
the rest of the day's journey is fairly uneventful.

01:50:23.037 --> 01:50:26.587
As you all prepare yourselves to bed down for the night,

01:50:26.587 --> 01:50:28.717
you have about two days--

01:50:28.717 --> 01:50:33.180
a little under two days travel with one more flight.

01:50:34.667 --> 01:50:35.717
The following day.

01:50:35.717 --> 01:50:38.457
That'll take it to just about one, a little over one.

01:50:38.457 --> 01:50:40.107
TALIESIN: We lose a point of exhaustion?

01:50:40.107 --> 01:50:41.336
MATT: You do after a night's rest, yes.

01:50:41.336 --> 01:50:42.169
LAURA: That's good.

01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:44.102
MATT: So you lose a point of exhaustion.

01:50:44.102 --> 01:50:45.556
Yasha, you're good now.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:50:45.556 --> 01:50:48.604
LAURA: What is the one point of exhaustion do,

01:50:48.604 --> 01:50:49.478
as opposed to the--

01:50:49.478 --> 01:50:50.761
MATT: That's disadvantage and ability checks.

01:50:50.761 --> 01:50:51.994
Two is speed halved.

01:50:51.994 --> 01:50:55.867
LAURA: Oh, okay. Woof. Uh oh.

01:50:55.867 --> 01:50:57.203
TRAVIS: Still doesn't look great.

01:50:57.203 --> 01:50:59.197
MATT: Yeah, but you're you're making up the time

01:50:59.197 --> 01:51:00.397
with the flight, which is good.

01:51:00.397 --> 01:51:01.230
LAURA: Okay.

01:51:01.230 --> 01:51:04.157
TALIESIN: This is the night where we can
talk to the head again.

01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:05.160
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:51:06.037 --> 01:51:08.349
TALIESIN: I've got some questions, but I'm happy

01:51:08.349 --> 01:51:12.406
to game this out once it's time.

01:51:12.406 --> 01:51:14.685
ASHLEY: Can we do this by the fire?
MARISHA: Yeah, let's figure it out

01:51:14.685 --> 01:51:16.694
while we walk and talk.
LAURA: We can do in the tower.

01:51:16.694 --> 01:51:17.734
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:51:17.734 --> 01:51:18.567
TALIESIN: End of day.

01:51:18.567 --> 01:51:19.957
MARISHA: Walk and talk, walk and talk.

01:51:19.957 --> 01:51:21.182
We're walking and talking.

01:51:21.182 --> 01:51:22.377
MATT: All right, you guys were walking and talking.

01:51:22.377 --> 01:51:23.967
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:51:23.967 --> 01:51:26.000
MATT: Dagen's far enough ahead that
you probably want to wait

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.897
until he's probably out of earshot.

01:51:27.897 --> 01:51:28.730
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that's right.

01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:30.704
TRAVIS: Oh, right, he doesn't want to know.

01:51:30.704 --> 01:51:34.382
MATT: Just throwing it out there again.

01:51:34.382 --> 01:51:36.921
TRAVIS: A little scramble the brain again.

01:51:36.921 --> 01:51:38.897
TALIESIN: A little more trauma.

01:51:38.897 --> 01:51:41.887
TRAVIS: All right, so what would you ask?

01:51:41.887 --> 01:51:45.177
TALIESIN: I want to know if they know
they're bringing back the city.

01:51:45.177 --> 01:51:47.818
I want to know how she did--

01:51:47.818 --> 01:51:51.787
how she emptied Lucien.

01:51:51.787 --> 01:51:55.977
How, and then that's-- I don't know.

01:51:55.977 --> 01:52:00.099
MARISHA: The questions we asked her before was:

01:52:00.099 --> 01:52:02.167
What do the tattoos mean?

01:52:02.167 --> 01:52:03.260
What is the book?

01:52:04.307 --> 01:52:05.597
Something went wrong with Molly,

01:52:05.597 --> 01:52:07.247
what happened?

01:52:07.247 --> 01:52:09.757
What does "To alpha to alpha and homeward bound" mean?

01:52:09.757 --> 01:52:11.497
What does it mean to be a Nonagon?

01:52:11.497 --> 01:52:14.013
LAURA: Did she actually answer any of those questions?

01:52:14.013 --> 01:52:14.880
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.863
LAURA: Okay.

01:52:15.863 --> 01:52:16.804
MATT: Obtusely.

01:52:16.804 --> 01:52:18.190
MARISHA: Obtusely.

01:52:18.190 --> 01:52:20.307
SAM: We want to know what's at A2.

01:52:20.307 --> 01:52:21.140
TRAVIS: Right.

01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:22.237
SAM: And what are these items that they're trying--

01:52:22.237 --> 01:52:24.477
LAURA: Oh right. Maybe we should ask if we should bother

01:52:24.477 --> 01:52:27.720
with A2, or if we should go straight to Aeor proper.

01:52:29.507 --> 01:52:32.123
MARISHA: Her answer to, "What does it mean to be a Nonagon?"

01:52:32.123 --> 01:52:33.606
was

01:52:33.606 --> 01:52:37.759
"Nonagon is a vessel, a key to Cognouza."

01:52:37.759 --> 01:52:38.592
LAURA: Oh, right.

01:52:38.592 --> 01:52:41.577
MARISHA: "The one to free the Somnovum."

01:52:41.577 --> 01:52:42.410
SAM: Jesus.

01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:44.437
TALIESIN: Somnovum is maybe the city?

01:52:44.437 --> 01:52:46.767
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:52:46.767 --> 01:52:48.207
SAM: But if she knows that,

01:52:48.207 --> 01:52:50.066
then she'll know what they need

01:52:50.066 --> 01:52:53.177
to get the city back, at least.

01:52:53.177 --> 01:52:54.577
MARISHA: She did answer to,

01:52:54.577 --> 01:52:57.427
"What does 'To alpha to alpha' mean 'and homeward bound,'"

01:52:57.427 --> 01:53:00.602
"I am uncertain. Many pieces lay strewn city to city."

01:53:00.602 --> 01:53:01.777
SAM: Many pieces.

01:53:01.777 --> 01:53:03.227
MARISHA: So that's where we got that

01:53:03.227 --> 01:53:05.927
"to alpha to alpha," were the city pieces, but...

01:53:05.927 --> 01:53:07.667
TALIESIN: They're collecting the pieces of the puzzle.

01:53:07.667 --> 01:53:09.980
They don't actually know how to do what they're doing.
LIAM: Why don't we ask her what is

01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:12.346
needed to unlock the Somnovum?

01:53:13.396 --> 01:53:14.906
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Ooh.

01:53:14.906 --> 01:53:16.297
That's good.

01:53:16.297 --> 01:53:17.130
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:53:18.837 --> 01:53:20.010
LAURA: We can also try.

01:53:24.048 --> 01:53:26.114
Well, we don't have any ivory, do we?

01:53:26.114 --> 01:53:28.207
Do you have any ivory, Caleb?

01:53:28.207 --> 01:53:31.015
LIAM: Let me look through my-- I don't think so.

01:53:34.077 --> 01:53:37.327
LAURA: Is there a rule about the components?

01:53:37.327 --> 01:53:40.317
Is it, like, if it has a worth of like gold pieces,

01:53:40.317 --> 01:53:45.127
then you can't use your focal point or something?

01:53:45.127 --> 01:53:46.377
Is that what the rule is?

01:53:47.247 --> 01:53:49.787
MATT: If it has a gold piece value,

01:53:49.787 --> 01:53:51.497
that means you can use your focus,

01:53:51.497 --> 01:53:54.047
but you still have to have that component with you.

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:58.067
The idea is your focus is used

01:53:58.067 --> 01:54:01.257
in place of other non-monetary valued components.

01:54:01.257 --> 01:54:04.957
LAURA: Okay, that's what I thought.
TALIESIN: We can use residuum.

01:54:04.957 --> 01:54:07.247
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Didn't we use all that already?

01:54:07.247 --> 01:54:11.447
LAURA: No, we have 200 gold worth of residuum left

01:54:11.447 --> 01:54:15.037
and there's always Legend Lore, which we could do

01:54:15.037 --> 01:54:18.327
and really ask the Wild Mother or the Traveler,

01:54:18.327 --> 01:54:22.487
like, what is known about--
MARISHA: That's kind of

01:54:22.487 --> 01:54:23.527
what I'm thinking.

01:54:23.527 --> 01:54:27.077
I think maybe-- well, between things like

01:54:27.077 --> 01:54:29.720
that and maybe a few message spells.

01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:32.537
Matt, do I know anything--

01:54:32.537 --> 01:54:36.237
Like, is Cognouza in Somnovum,

01:54:36.237 --> 01:54:39.728
like an equivalent of our Latin root?

01:54:39.728 --> 01:54:42.375
Is it something that I would maybe know,

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:45.837
like, the root wordage of?

01:54:45.837 --> 01:54:47.207
MATT: Roll a history check.

01:54:47.207 --> 01:54:49.417
TALIESIN: We can message the library.
MARISHA: The Cobalt Soul.

01:54:49.417 --> 01:54:52.252
I can message the library potentially.

01:54:52.252 --> 01:54:54.427
MATT: Still with disadvantage because you still haven't--

01:54:54.427 --> 01:54:55.585
MARISHA: But why?

01:54:55.585 --> 01:54:58.099
LAURA: Because we're still exhausted.
MARISHA: You still have a point of exhaustion.

01:54:58.099 --> 01:54:59.718
LAURA: (laughs)

01:54:59.718 --> 01:55:01.230
MARISHA: No, though.
LAURA: But I love you.

01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:03.555
MARISHA: But I love you. I love you.

01:55:05.618 --> 01:55:07.247
(fake crying)

01:55:07.247 --> 01:55:09.581
One of them was a natural 20,

01:55:09.581 --> 01:55:11.996
but instead I'm going to have to go with a dirty 20.

01:55:11.996 --> 01:55:13.529
MATT: Okay.

01:55:13.529 --> 01:55:15.412
Unfortunately, you can't recall in your studies

01:55:15.412 --> 01:55:19.627
anything that you can attribute specifically to the

01:55:19.627 --> 01:55:21.843
verbage, the root words.
MARISHA: I can't even like...

01:55:21.843 --> 01:55:24.135
No. Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

01:55:24.135 --> 01:55:26.714
ASHLEY: That's the city in the Somnovum--

01:55:29.089 --> 01:55:30.980
to the free the Somnovum?

01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.667
MARISHA: The one, to, yeah. "Nonagon is a vessel, the key

01:55:33.667 --> 01:55:37.557
"to Cognouza, the one to free the Somnovum."

01:55:37.557 --> 01:55:39.377
Also, I was writing very quickly,

01:55:39.377 --> 01:55:43.089
so there might be some words missing.

01:55:44.081 --> 01:55:47.977
TALIESIN: You would remember if there were words missing

01:55:47.977 --> 01:55:49.667
from what she's saying.

01:55:49.667 --> 01:55:50.587
I think, right?

01:55:50.587 --> 01:55:52.387
TRAVIS: That's right, she got it.

01:55:52.387 --> 01:55:53.321
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:55:53.321 --> 01:55:55.377
MARISHA: Is that more or less at any like key factors?

01:55:55.377 --> 01:55:56.210
Okay.

01:55:56.210 --> 01:55:58.140
TALIESIN: I mean, you could ask your people.

01:55:59.037 --> 01:56:00.367
LAURA: Yeah, we could send a message.

01:56:00.367 --> 01:56:01.767
TALIESIN: You got people to read the books.

01:56:01.767 --> 01:56:03.547
LAURA: You could write down exactly what you want me to say.

01:56:03.547 --> 01:56:04.939
So I don't fuck it up.

01:56:05.927 --> 01:56:09.517
MARISHA: Okay, I guess we're while we're walking.

01:56:09.517 --> 01:56:10.350
MATT: Sure.

01:56:12.457 --> 01:56:13.320
MARISHA: Okay.

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:15.752
TRAVIS: Out of earshot of Dagen.

01:56:15.752 --> 01:56:17.457
MARISHA: Out of here out of Dagen.

01:56:20.262 --> 01:56:23.543
LAURA: But this is all-- we're not
talking about Vess DeRogna right now.

01:56:23.543 --> 01:56:25.771
TRAVIS: I don't think he wants to know any of it.

01:56:25.771 --> 01:56:27.987
MARISHA: Talk about other stuff while I think about this.

01:56:27.987 --> 01:56:28.820
LAURA: Okay.

01:56:30.481 --> 01:56:31.750
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

01:56:32.887 --> 01:56:33.757
LAURA: Walking.

01:56:33.757 --> 01:56:34.907
TALIESIN: Make our way while we're talking.

01:56:34.907 --> 01:56:36.834
MARISHA: 25 words, right?
LAURA: Yes.

01:56:36.834 --> 01:56:38.642
TRAVIS: How many questions do you get?

01:56:38.642 --> 01:56:39.475
TALIESIN: Five, I think.

01:56:39.475 --> 01:56:40.308
TRAVIS: Five total.

01:56:40.308 --> 01:56:41.737
And we have three now

01:56:41.737 --> 01:56:44.462
or four? We have a lot.

01:56:44.462 --> 01:56:47.587
TALIESIN: I've got three-ish.

01:56:48.637 --> 01:56:50.577
LAURA: Hey, are we going to ask questions

01:56:50.577 --> 01:56:53.700
of that poor sap that I chopped his head off?

01:56:55.063 --> 01:56:55.896
SAM: Oh.

01:56:55.896 --> 01:56:56.927
TALIESIN: Oh, I forgotten.

01:56:56.927 --> 01:56:58.721
SAM: Wait, who was that?

01:56:58.721 --> 01:57:03.357
LAURA: He was just a dude that was probably standing guard

01:57:03.357 --> 01:57:04.827
or something that died.

01:57:04.827 --> 01:57:06.557
SAM: Yeah, we probably can ditch that head.

01:57:06.557 --> 01:57:08.057
ASHLEY: About him.

01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:11.883
LAURA: Fjord, do you want to
dump that head out into the snow

01:57:11.883 --> 01:57:13.807
or we can keep it for the time being.

01:57:13.807 --> 01:57:14.967
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:57:14.967 --> 01:57:17.867
It's just getting really interesting in the bag.

01:57:17.867 --> 01:57:20.225
MATT: Okay, so.

01:57:20.225 --> 01:57:22.107
Have we rolled?

01:57:22.107 --> 01:57:22.940
LAURA: For the day?

01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.427
MATT: For the next day?

01:57:24.427 --> 01:57:25.427
Because you guys have...
SAM: My turn?

01:57:25.427 --> 01:57:26.260
LAURA: Yeah.

01:57:27.637 --> 01:57:29.299
SAM: Four.

01:57:29.299 --> 01:57:30.757
LAURA: Oh no.

01:57:33.327 --> 01:57:34.537
MATT: The weather is clear,

01:57:34.537 --> 01:57:39.205
and despite still chilly wind, passage is safe.

01:57:39.205 --> 01:57:41.217
SAM: Great.
LAURA: All right.

01:57:41.217 --> 01:57:43.890
Yes! So we should do another flight.

01:57:44.977 --> 01:57:46.572
And really gain some time.

01:57:46.572 --> 01:57:49.455
It's just a matter of if we want to send this message

01:57:49.455 --> 01:57:51.677
before we fly or after we fly.

01:57:51.677 --> 01:57:54.808
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:57:54.808 --> 01:57:55.858
Well--

01:57:58.608 --> 01:58:02.027
Do they have a time limit on when they need to respond?

01:58:02.027 --> 01:58:02.937
MATT: Pretty quickly.

01:58:02.937 --> 01:58:05.387
MARISHA: Well, let's fly and
I'll think about it while we fly.

01:58:05.387 --> 01:58:06.220
LAURA: Okay.

01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:09.567
MATT: All right, so utilizing your same-- perfect--

01:58:09.567 --> 01:58:12.697
your same arrangement, your trio of giant eagles

01:58:12.697 --> 01:58:15.707
lift up the rest of your troop and make your way onward

01:58:15.707 --> 01:58:18.120
in the direction that you continue to go.

01:58:19.267 --> 01:58:20.757
After the hour is done,

01:58:20.757 --> 01:58:24.047
you all come back down onto the frozen surface

01:58:24.047 --> 01:58:25.197
and continue on trekking.

01:58:26.357 --> 01:58:28.857
So during the rest of that journey,

01:58:28.857 --> 01:58:32.610
you begin to develop the question you want to ask.

01:58:33.617 --> 01:58:37.738
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:58:38.658 --> 01:58:41.107
MATT: And you continue walking as it's developed.

01:58:41.107 --> 01:58:42.353
TALIESIN: Walking in a circle now.

01:58:42.353 --> 01:58:43.519
MATT: Yep.

01:58:43.519 --> 01:58:44.969
Just cut to one side.

01:58:46.017 --> 01:58:50.907
As the day draws colder and darker,

01:58:50.907 --> 01:58:53.197
you eventually prepare yourselves to bed down,

01:58:53.197 --> 01:58:55.340
what I assume, once again, is in the nein-sided tower?

01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:56.967
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:58:56.967 --> 01:58:58.437
MATT: So you gather your things

01:58:59.757 --> 01:59:02.457
and make your way to what is the final night to rest

01:59:02.457 --> 01:59:04.980
before reaching your destination the following day.

01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:06.607
MARISHA: Okay.

01:59:06.607 --> 01:59:11.103
MATT: Now, as you were all preparing the night's rest,

01:59:11.103 --> 01:59:13.067
what are you doing?

01:59:13.067 --> 01:59:15.558
TALIESIN: Let's talk to a head

01:59:15.558 --> 01:59:18.077
and send a message to some librarians.

01:59:18.077 --> 01:59:19.966
SAM: You just excuse Dagen upstairs.

01:59:19.966 --> 01:59:21.385
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Dagen.

01:59:21.385 --> 01:59:22.218
MATT: "Yeah, what?"

01:59:22.218 --> 01:59:24.250
SAM: Let's get you a nightcap.

01:59:26.267 --> 01:59:29.727
Jinx, Jellicle, Jangles,

01:59:29.727 --> 01:59:34.657
could you get Dagen here a sherry?

01:59:34.657 --> 01:59:36.817
An after dinner sherry. Have we had dinner?

01:59:36.817 --> 01:59:39.200
We've had dinner. Get you a sherry.

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:41.600
MATT: "I'll take it. Come on up."

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:44.917
LIAM: Tell Aesop to go up and
walk on his back again, please.

01:59:44.917 --> 01:59:46.907
MATT: "Yes, please," and he's like floating his way up

01:59:46.907 --> 01:59:47.740
to his chamber.

01:59:48.757 --> 01:59:52.717
LAURA: Don't come down here;
we're talking about secret things.

01:59:52.717 --> 01:59:54.518
MATT: "Works for me!"

01:59:55.457 --> 01:59:57.073
He shoves off for his night of sherry and back biscuits.

01:59:57.073 --> 02:00:00.948
He shoves off for his night of sherry and back biscuits.

02:00:00.948 --> 02:00:02.160
(laughter)

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:03.453
LAURA: That sounds like a good night.

02:00:03.453 --> 02:00:04.344
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah, it does.

02:00:04.344 --> 02:00:05.761
I could use that.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:00:06.627 --> 02:00:08.797
TALIESIN: City.
TRAVIS: I would die.

02:00:08.797 --> 02:00:12.451
TALIESIN: How did you empty Lucien?

02:00:12.451 --> 02:00:15.357
LIAM: What is needed to unlock Somnovum?

02:00:15.357 --> 02:00:20.248
TALIESIN: What is needed to unlock Somnovin.

02:00:20.248 --> 02:00:21.086
TALIESIN: What is needed to unlock Somnovin.

02:00:21.086 --> 02:00:22.911
LAURA and LIAM: Somnovum.

02:00:24.307 --> 02:00:27.087
MARISHA: Is there anything else?
I've got about five words left.

02:00:27.087 --> 02:00:28.797
LAURA: I don't know what your question is yet.

02:00:28.797 --> 02:00:30.750
TALIESIN: What are they looking for at A2?

02:00:33.317 --> 02:00:34.898
TRAVIS: Not what are they looking for.

02:00:34.898 --> 02:00:36.626
Do they <i>need</i> anything from A2?

02:00:36.626 --> 02:00:37.459
LAURA: Oh, right.

02:00:37.459 --> 02:00:39.587
TALIESIN: Yeah, do they need anything from A2?

02:00:39.587 --> 02:00:42.315
MARISHA: I have: From Expositor Lionett.

02:00:42.315 --> 02:00:46.033
Pursuing-- Deep in Eiselcross, pursuing Eyes of Nine.

02:00:46.033 --> 02:00:48.087
TALIESIN: What she looking for?

02:00:48.087 --> 02:00:50.429
MARISHA: Any information or etymology on words

02:00:50.429 --> 02:00:54.745
"Cognouza" or "Somnovum."

02:00:54.745 --> 02:00:56.720
And I've got like five words left.

02:00:58.857 --> 02:01:00.295
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:01:00.295 --> 02:01:03.687
TRAVIS: She had it marked on the map, but if...

02:01:03.687 --> 02:01:07.987
LAURA: Yeah, we have find someone who can send a message

02:01:07.987 --> 02:01:09.367
to you and let them know.

02:01:09.367 --> 02:01:12.127
Because that's a lot of information.

02:01:12.127 --> 02:01:14.177
Otherwise, we can check back in the morning.

02:01:14.177 --> 02:01:16.227
You can say that we'll check back the morning.

02:01:16.227 --> 02:01:18.397
MARISHA: Okay. Uh, yeah--
TALIESIN: What is she looking for at...

02:01:18.397 --> 02:01:19.347
MARISHA: That's a good idea for certain.

02:01:19.347 --> 02:01:21.877
TRAVIS: Is there anything they need at A2?

02:01:21.877 --> 02:01:23.002
LAURA: Work fast. We'll check back

02:01:23.002 --> 02:01:24.635
in the morning.
TRAVIS: 'Cause if not, we won't go.

02:01:27.727 --> 02:01:28.560
TALIESIN: Anything--

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:30.084
SAM: This is pretty serious busy work going on.

02:01:30.084 --> 02:01:31.392
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

02:01:31.392 --> 02:01:32.717
TALIESIN: -- at A2.
SAM: In the meantime,

02:01:32.717 --> 02:01:33.787
I'm just going to ask

02:01:33.787 --> 02:01:37.917
Yasha to strum her harp for us, just sort of...

02:01:37.917 --> 02:01:42.531
ASHLEY: For bardic inspiration?

02:01:42.531 --> 02:01:44.567
SAM: Just to kind of lighten the mood

02:01:44.567 --> 02:01:45.957
because it's kind of tense tonight.

02:01:45.957 --> 02:01:47.807
I mean, we got oldie over here

02:01:47.807 --> 02:01:50.022
and these two guys are just writing everything.

02:01:50.022 --> 02:01:51.824
LAURA: I'm just going to be touching my horns.

02:01:51.824 --> 02:01:54.083
I'm trying to figure out how much they've grown.

02:01:54.957 --> 02:01:56.150
ASHLEY: Slowly strumming.

02:01:56.150 --> 02:01:57.531
SAM: You got, like, whiskers.

02:01:57.531 --> 02:01:59.136
LAURA: Shut up! No, I don't, Nott!
SAM: Just a couple whiskers!

02:01:59.136 --> 02:02:00.126
Just pluck them!
LAURA: If I have whiskers,

02:02:00.126 --> 02:02:01.642
<i>you</i> have whiskers.

02:02:01.642 --> 02:02:03.115
TALIESIN: Accidentally clicked the wrong--

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:05.397
(laughter)

02:02:05.397 --> 02:02:08.064
LAURA: Does my horn jewelry still fit my horns?

02:02:08.064 --> 02:02:08.897
MATT: Yeah.

02:02:08.897 --> 02:02:10.194
LAURA: Okay.

02:02:10.194 --> 02:02:13.217
ASHLEY: I mean, I actually think the extra years

02:02:13.217 --> 02:02:14.857
looks great on you.

02:02:14.857 --> 02:02:16.837
MARISHA: Okay, I'm ready.

02:02:16.837 --> 02:02:21.267
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send a message right now.

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:22.492
To whom am I sending it?

02:02:22.492 --> 02:02:23.442
MARISHA: Yudala Fon.

02:02:23.442 --> 02:02:25.947
We're going straight to the fucking top.

02:02:25.947 --> 02:02:29.362
LAURA: To Yudala Fon, sending the message.

02:02:30.907 --> 02:02:32.087
MARISHA: From Expositor Lionett.

02:02:32.087 --> 02:02:33.558
LAURA: From Expositor Lionett.

02:02:33.558 --> 02:02:34.391
TALIESIN: Five questions.

02:02:34.391 --> 02:02:35.912
LIAM: You have five already?
TRAVIS: Is that part of the message?

02:02:35.912 --> 02:02:36.745
TALIESIN: Well, I have one--

02:02:36.745 --> 02:02:38.627
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:02:38.627 --> 02:02:40.437
Did you know about the city?

02:02:40.437 --> 02:02:42.570
MARISHA: We'll hold on this.
TRAVIS: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Message.

02:02:42.570 --> 02:02:44.777
LIAM: We'll do this first.
SAM: Here we go.

02:02:44.777 --> 02:02:47.144
MARISHA: From Expositor Lionett.

02:02:47.144 --> 02:02:48.077
Deep in Eiselcross.

02:02:48.077 --> 02:02:49.535
LAURA: Deep in Eiselcross.

02:02:49.535 --> 02:02:50.410
MARISHA: Pursuing Nine Eyes.

02:02:50.410 --> 02:02:52.087
LAURA: Pursuing Nine Eyes.

02:02:52.087 --> 02:02:53.227
MARISHA: Any information.

02:02:53.227 --> 02:02:54.557
LAURA: Any information.

02:02:54.557 --> 02:02:55.557
MARISHA: Or etymology.

02:02:55.557 --> 02:02:57.227
LAURA: Or etymology!?

02:02:57.227 --> 02:02:58.060
MARISHA: On words.

02:02:58.060 --> 02:02:59.581
LAURA: On words.

02:02:59.581 --> 02:03:00.592
MARISHA: Cognouza.

02:03:00.592 --> 02:03:01.792
LAURA: Cognouza.

02:03:01.792 --> 02:03:04.857
MARISHA and LAURA: Or Somnovum.

02:03:04.857 --> 02:03:05.690
MARISHA: Work fast.

02:03:05.690 --> 02:03:07.227
LAURA: Work fast.

02:03:07.227 --> 02:03:08.877
MARISHA: Will check back in morning.

02:03:08.877 --> 02:03:11.217
LAURA: Will check back in morning.

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:14.573
SAM: Who's on Tal'Dorei Council?

02:03:14.573 --> 02:03:16.547
(laughter)

02:03:16.547 --> 02:03:18.747
MATT: Just squeeze it in there at the very end.

02:03:18.747 --> 02:03:20.754
TALIESIN: Two more questions.

02:03:20.754 --> 02:03:21.657
LAURA: I was giving it time

02:03:21.657 --> 02:03:23.047
so that Yudala Fon would be able

02:03:23.047 --> 02:03:25.047
to write down some of these things.

02:03:25.047 --> 02:03:26.547
MATT: Fair enough.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:03:27.697 --> 02:03:29.883
MATT: Okay, the response comes.

02:03:31.087 --> 02:03:35.627
"Ah, I thank you for the information.

02:03:36.867 --> 02:03:39.437
"I will pass this onto our archivists

02:03:39.437 --> 02:03:41.757
"and see what we can find."

02:03:45.107 --> 02:03:46.907
MARISHA: That's it for now.

02:03:46.907 --> 02:03:47.740
LAURA: All right.

02:03:48.577 --> 02:03:52.557
TALIESIN: So, so far, is there anything he needs at A2?

02:03:52.557 --> 02:03:55.202
Did she know about the floating city?

02:03:58.237 --> 02:03:59.268
TRAVIS: Is that important?

02:03:59.268 --> 02:04:00.284
Is that--
TALIESIN: Or we can ask--

02:04:00.284 --> 02:04:02.442
we can-- and I don't know. We can ask her--

02:04:02.442 --> 02:04:04.107
LAURA: Yes, she's got know about the floating city.

02:04:04.107 --> 02:04:08.547
TALIESIN: We can ask her what a Somnovum is.

02:04:08.547 --> 02:04:10.214
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:04:10.214 --> 02:04:14.528
TALIESIN: What is Somnovum?

02:04:14.528 --> 02:04:16.537
How did you empty Lucien?

02:04:17.947 --> 02:04:18.957
And that's three questions.

02:04:18.957 --> 02:04:20.457
LIAM: Three?

02:04:20.457 --> 02:04:24.644
Why did you want to unlock Somnovum?

02:04:24.644 --> 02:04:26.753
TALIESIN: Why did you want to...

02:04:26.753 --> 02:04:28.577
TRAVIS: How do we beat Lucien?

02:04:28.577 --> 02:04:30.902
SAM: Oh yeah, does it help us to know, like,

02:04:30.902 --> 02:04:32.910
how did Lucien kill you?

02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:36.397
Or, like, what sort of power does he have or?

02:04:36.397 --> 02:04:37.979
LAURA: How would we stop them?

02:04:37.979 --> 02:04:39.585
Do you feel vengeful?

02:04:39.585 --> 02:04:41.945
Maybe how do we stop them from succeeding?

02:04:41.945 --> 02:04:43.113
TRAVIS: Feels like if she knew a weakness,

02:04:43.113 --> 02:04:44.434
she would have been able to exploit it.

02:04:44.434 --> 02:04:45.267
ASHLEY: I'm also curious.

02:04:45.267 --> 02:04:46.607
I don't know if this would help us in any way,

02:04:46.607 --> 02:04:51.607
but why does she keep doing this to him? To Lucien?

02:04:51.939 --> 02:04:53.690
Why does he keep getting--

02:04:54.657 --> 02:04:57.184
they keep getting emptied?

02:04:57.184 --> 02:04:59.517
LAURA: He might've only been emptied one time.

02:04:59.517 --> 02:05:00.397
TALIESIN: Maybe.

02:05:00.397 --> 02:05:03.664
LAURA: Maybe she just did it the
once and he came back, you know?

02:05:05.217 --> 02:05:06.837
LIAM: I have a question, too.

02:05:06.837 --> 02:05:08.777
If there's room for it.

02:05:08.777 --> 02:05:09.871
TALIESIN: These things can change

02:05:09.871 --> 02:05:11.797
as is the conversation goes forward.

02:05:11.797 --> 02:05:13.177
LIAM: This is the priority,

02:05:13.177 --> 02:05:17.405
but if there's room, I have something unrelated to ask her.

02:05:18.267 --> 02:05:19.177
TALIESIN: Let me know.

02:05:19.177 --> 02:05:20.780
I mean, what is it?

02:05:22.117 --> 02:05:24.437
LIAM: I'd be curious to know if the Cerberus Assembly

02:05:24.437 --> 02:05:27.266
would tolerate the removal of Trent Ikithon.

02:05:29.127 --> 02:05:31.517
TALIESIN: That's a lot to write down.
Let me know when we get there.

02:05:38.094 --> 02:05:39.815
All right, do we want to do this?

02:05:39.815 --> 02:05:41.631
LAURA: (whispered) Let's do it!

02:05:42.947 --> 02:05:43.827
TALIESIN: All right.

02:05:43.827 --> 02:05:45.459
Set up the head and...

02:05:46.985 --> 02:05:49.637
SAM: Should we probably put the head on top

02:05:49.637 --> 02:05:51.785
of one of the cats, just so--

02:05:51.785 --> 02:05:53.502
LAURA: It feels like--
SAM: -- like feels like it's alive?

02:05:53.502 --> 02:05:55.014
TALIESIN: I'm just gonna walk away.

02:05:55.014 --> 02:05:56.547
(laughter)

02:05:56.547 --> 02:06:00.921
TALIESIN: And I prefer focus.

02:06:00.921 --> 02:06:02.757
LAURA: Ooh, let's make the room really dark

02:06:02.757 --> 02:06:05.377
and only have light underneath our faces,

02:06:05.377 --> 02:06:07.623
so we seem more intimidating.
LIAM: Well, we're in the tower,

02:06:07.623 --> 02:06:11.007
so I just telepathically make

02:06:11.007 --> 02:06:16.007
the globules dim. And I put a big silver platter

02:06:16.167 --> 02:06:21.167
on a wide, low table before the main fireplace

02:06:21.457 --> 02:06:24.465
in the salon for her head.

02:06:24.465 --> 02:06:25.917
MATT: All right.

02:06:25.917 --> 02:06:28.059
ASHLEY: I want her head on a platter.

02:06:28.059 --> 02:06:30.059
(low chuckles)

02:06:31.308 --> 02:06:34.527
MATT: And with that, you have the dull, ghastly,

02:06:34.527 --> 02:06:37.414
lifeless head of Vess DeRogna

02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:43.034
lit rather macabrely

02:06:43.034 --> 02:06:45.417
at your disposal.

02:06:50.177 --> 02:06:52.169
TALIESIN: This might be the last time.

02:06:53.877 --> 02:06:55.537
What is Somnovum?

02:06:57.196 --> 02:06:59.334
MATT: With the head sits there resting.

02:06:59.334 --> 02:07:02.117
"(creaking gasp)

02:07:05.757 --> 02:07:09.447
"They are the minds of Cognouza."

02:07:09.447 --> 02:07:10.647
MARISHA: Minds?

02:07:10.647 --> 02:07:12.760
TRAVIS: The minds.

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:17.281
MATT: "The ones who orchestrated its escape,

02:07:18.282 --> 02:07:21.373
"and wish now to return."

02:07:30.498 --> 02:07:32.067
TALIESIN: I'm going off-script.

02:07:32.067 --> 02:07:33.108
SAM: Already?

02:07:33.108 --> 02:07:35.387
(laughter)

02:07:35.387 --> 02:07:36.320
TALIESIN: That all right?

02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:37.161
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Sure.

02:07:37.161 --> 02:07:38.344
LIAM: Your spell.

02:07:40.307 --> 02:07:41.500
TALIESIN: Escape from what?

02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:46.131
MATT: "The destruction of Aeor.

02:07:47.529 --> 02:07:51.779
"They betrayed their own city to ensure their survival."

02:07:51.779 --> 02:07:56.354
"They betrayed their own city to ensure their survival."

02:08:12.150 --> 02:08:14.627
TALIESIN: Why did you want to unlock--

02:08:14.627 --> 02:08:16.390
bring back Somnovum?

02:08:21.127 --> 02:08:24.037
MATT: "To become one of the minds

02:08:24.037 --> 02:08:29.037
"is to receive the lost knowledge of the greatest

02:08:30.377 --> 02:08:33.438
"mageocracy in history."

02:08:44.107 --> 02:08:48.770
TALIESIN: We are collecting the keys to complete this.

02:08:49.977 --> 02:08:52.023
What do we need at A2?

02:08:55.087 --> 02:08:59.835
MATT: "It requires the means to come back.

02:09:03.207 --> 02:09:08.157
"Enough crests to replace lost

02:09:09.127 --> 02:09:11.394
"when it found the storm."

02:09:15.617 --> 02:09:18.425
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, Caleb. I've got one more.

02:09:22.747 --> 02:09:25.582
Where must the ritual be completed?

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.963
MATT: "The gate lies in the center

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:35.651
"of the city's ruin."

02:09:35.651 --> 02:09:37.930
MARISHA: (to herself) The gate lies in--

02:09:37.930 --> 02:09:39.577
TALIESIN: I think-- is that five?

02:09:40.416 --> 02:09:42.167
LAURA: That was five.

02:09:42.167 --> 02:09:45.407
MATT: And it slumps forward with a sickening (splat).

02:09:45.407 --> 02:09:47.107
TALIESIN: It's going to burn it out eventually.

02:09:47.107 --> 02:09:47.940
LAURA: Yeah.

02:09:49.877 --> 02:09:51.490
LIAM: Put a cloth over the head.

02:09:52.817 --> 02:09:57.380
TALIESIN: There is one more call we could make: Essek's.

02:09:58.770 --> 02:10:01.437
We could let him know everything.

02:10:01.437 --> 02:10:02.487
<i>Everything.</i>

02:10:02.487 --> 02:10:03.897
TRAVIS: That's trouble is coming?

02:10:03.897 --> 02:10:05.338
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: What kind of trouble.

02:10:05.338 --> 02:10:06.560
What words to look up.

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.476
What to research.

02:10:07.476 --> 02:10:10.837
There's no sense playing ridiculous

02:10:10.837 --> 02:10:12.497
political games right now.

02:10:12.497 --> 02:10:13.330
LAURA: Yeah.

02:10:13.330 --> 02:10:14.757
LIAM: I don't know if we want to tell Essek

02:10:14.757 --> 02:10:17.697
that there is a potential way to plug

02:10:17.697 --> 02:10:20.167
into the greatest minds--

02:10:20.167 --> 02:10:22.700
TALIESIN: Well.
LIAM: -- of the arcane in all history.

02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:24.527
TALIESIN: I think we are a little more honest with him

02:10:24.527 --> 02:10:27.667
and tell him that that's absolutely not what this is.

02:10:27.667 --> 02:10:30.437
That's a lie.

02:10:30.437 --> 02:10:31.760
This is destruction.

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:35.558
There's no knowledge in that thing. It is a...

02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:38.377
There's nothing to be learned

02:10:38.377 --> 02:10:39.795
from that kind of chaos.

02:10:39.795 --> 02:10:42.104
MARISHA: What is stopping it?

02:10:43.271 --> 02:10:44.737
What makes you think he doesn't already

02:10:44.737 --> 02:10:47.225
know all of this and isn't in pursuit

02:10:47.225 --> 02:10:48.837
of it in himself?

02:10:50.857 --> 02:10:55.347
He's a dope-ass mage just like she was.

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:58.567
TALIESIN: I feel like he'd be out here already.

02:10:58.567 --> 02:11:03.567
MARISHA: Maybe he just has a few different pieces

02:11:03.677 --> 02:11:05.777
of the puzzle and we've caught the others.

02:11:06.917 --> 02:11:09.407
TALIESIN: We've convinced him to listen to reason once.

02:11:09.407 --> 02:11:10.862
That's all I have.

02:11:12.617 --> 02:11:14.825
LIAM: I honestly don't trust him enough.

02:11:16.607 --> 02:11:18.407
TALIESIN: Maybe we can tell him just enough.

02:11:19.477 --> 02:11:20.310
MARISHA: We already know--
LAURA: We could tell him that

02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:22.277
we need his help to stop the Tomb Takers,

02:11:22.277 --> 02:11:24.492
that the Tomb Takers are trying

02:11:24.492 --> 02:11:27.317
to bring back an entity that is...

02:11:27.317 --> 02:11:30.097
TALIESIN: A city-sized entity that will...

02:11:30.097 --> 02:11:32.264
LAURA: Destroy everything.
TALIESIN: Bring chaos.

02:11:34.165 --> 02:11:35.637
MARISHA: And, I mean, we already know that the Dynasty

02:11:35.637 --> 02:11:37.857
and the Empire fighting for relics

02:11:37.857 --> 02:11:41.207
and knowledge from this place. We know that's why he's here.

02:11:41.207 --> 02:11:45.177
We just don't know the specifics.

02:11:45.177 --> 02:11:47.347
TRAVIS: I mean, what advantage would we give, though?

02:11:47.347 --> 02:11:48.957
Even if we say there's an enemy coming

02:11:48.957 --> 02:11:51.337
that doesn't change anything. We need to check away

02:11:51.337 --> 02:11:53.427
a key component of what they're looking for.

02:11:53.427 --> 02:11:55.112
Maybe there's a lodestone today

02:11:55.112 --> 02:11:57.647
or maybe they need to remove it themselves.

02:11:57.647 --> 02:11:59.107
TALIESIN: Maybe he can find the site.

02:11:59.107 --> 02:12:01.037
Maybe you can find another component

02:12:01.037 --> 02:12:04.067
before they do. Lock it down.

02:12:04.067 --> 02:12:06.347
TRAVIS: Right, it's not so much defending the city

02:12:06.347 --> 02:12:07.180
or stopping them.

02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:12.087
Maybe they need to take the last piece and move.

02:12:12.087 --> 02:12:16.337
TALIESIN: I think it's foolish to ignore allies right now.

02:12:16.337 --> 02:12:19.365
Even if they are shifty. This is all hands.

02:12:19.365 --> 02:12:21.277
MARISHA: I'm not suggesting we ignore allies.

02:12:21.277 --> 02:12:25.737
I am just laying out the fact that we are in a rat race

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:28.094
that we only know a part of the rules of.

02:12:28.094 --> 02:12:29.597
LIAM: Yes, if we pull him in,

02:12:29.597 --> 02:12:31.477
I don't want to whet his appetite

02:12:31.477 --> 02:12:33.967
for the same thing that Vess hungered for.

02:12:33.967 --> 02:12:37.732
MARISHA: Agreed. Okay.

02:12:37.732 --> 02:12:39.792
LAURA: I don't have enough words to really whet his appetite

02:12:39.792 --> 02:12:41.000
in that way anyway.

02:12:42.383 --> 02:12:43.971
TALIESIN: (emphasizing the H) Whet.

02:12:43.971 --> 02:12:45.047
MARISHA: (like Taliesin) Whet.

02:12:45.047 --> 02:12:47.585
LAURA: When I saw the vision of the city,

02:12:48.897 --> 02:12:51.077
did it feel as disturbing

02:12:52.717 --> 02:12:54.258
as it did when we saw it with Vo- Vokado?

02:12:54.258 --> 02:12:58.745
as it did when we saw it with Vo- Vokado?

02:12:58.745 --> 02:13:00.097
I always think Avocado.

02:13:00.097 --> 02:13:00.930
MATT: Yeah.

02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:07.547
Equally, if not more so,

02:13:07.547 --> 02:13:09.787
even though the vision was but an instant,

02:13:09.787 --> 02:13:14.320
you felt a prolonged view.

02:13:16.485 --> 02:13:18.310
You sensed this

02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:23.201
bottomless hunger

02:13:23.201 --> 02:13:25.343
that seemed to emanate from it.

02:13:26.517 --> 02:13:31.517
You swear one moment you saw a shifting piece

02:13:31.897 --> 02:13:34.957
of ethereal rock, like so many

02:13:34.957 --> 02:13:39.957
that just drift through the astral plane, draw near

02:13:40.297 --> 02:13:45.160
before the island stretched like a pseudopod and consumed it

02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:47.735
and expanded ever so slightly.

02:13:48.867 --> 02:13:50.297
As you think back,

02:13:50.297 --> 02:13:52.617
you remember seeing the streets empty,

02:13:52.617 --> 02:13:53.917
but you could hear voices.

02:13:53.917 --> 02:13:58.917
Hundreds of voices, sourceless, whispering,

02:13:59.489 --> 02:14:04.489
screaming nonstop. This nightmarish cacophony

02:14:04.677 --> 02:14:08.777
of torment and confusion

02:14:08.777 --> 02:14:11.227
and laughter and memory.

02:14:14.717 --> 02:14:16.637
And yet there were still minds amongst them

02:14:16.637 --> 02:14:18.612
that were stronger than the others.

02:14:24.867 --> 02:14:26.097
And you shake your head.

02:14:26.097 --> 02:14:27.437
Like the more you think back,

02:14:27.437 --> 02:14:32.437
the more details click in from that vision.

02:14:33.057 --> 02:14:36.800
And it makes it even more terrifying.

02:14:38.231 --> 02:14:40.527
LAURA: I imagine it's one of those things that take root,

02:14:40.527 --> 02:14:44.092
that you can't shake it once you've seen it.

02:14:49.287 --> 02:14:52.637
LIAM: So Vess wanted her own consciousness to be uplifted

02:14:52.637 --> 02:14:56.547
LIAM: So Vess wanted her own consciousness to be uplifted

02:14:56.547 --> 02:14:58.763
to be joined with...

02:15:01.055 --> 02:15:03.371
It's like their souls have become light.

02:15:03.371 --> 02:15:05.717
TALIESIN: I don't think she understood
the nature of this thing.

02:15:05.717 --> 02:15:07.307
LIAM: I don't either, but...

02:15:07.307 --> 02:15:09.970
LAURA: She thought that when it came back,

02:15:09.970 --> 02:15:13.929
she would be even more powerful made, right?

02:15:13.929 --> 02:15:16.171
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: There's no coming back from this thing.

02:15:16.171 --> 02:15:19.254
It's in my head and there is no--

02:15:19.254 --> 02:15:22.545
This is-- there is no coming back from this thing.

02:15:22.545 --> 02:15:25.624
It's-- it can't be.

02:15:25.624 --> 02:15:30.624
LIAM: The vision had hundreds of thousands

02:15:30.987 --> 02:15:32.747
of voices co-mingling together,

02:15:32.747 --> 02:15:36.197
but a few stronger within.

02:15:37.355 --> 02:15:39.607
Maybe they are the Eyes of Nine.

02:15:39.607 --> 02:15:40.440
LAURA: Yeah.

02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:42.157
LIAM: Maybe it is every person who ever lived

02:15:42.157 --> 02:15:47.157
in the city and its ruling nine.

02:15:47.287 --> 02:15:50.547
And there's an offer to the Nonagon to join the club.

02:15:51.927 --> 02:15:53.527
TALIESIN: Or at least they think so.

02:15:53.527 --> 02:15:54.360
LIAM: Yeah.

02:15:56.177 --> 02:15:57.420
LAURA: We have to stop it.

02:15:59.527 --> 02:16:01.780
MARISHA: Group of mages, thought that they were...

02:16:04.898 --> 02:16:07.787
I don't know, saving their city.

02:16:07.787 --> 02:16:10.737
And instead they damned it

02:16:10.737 --> 02:16:13.820
to insanity and an eternal Astral Sea.

02:16:16.007 --> 02:16:20.507
TALIESIN: I think perhaps you're
too kind to their intentions.

02:16:21.697 --> 02:16:25.637
SAM: Did she give us any concrete thing

02:16:25.637 --> 02:16:27.310
to look forward at A2?

02:16:28.797 --> 02:16:30.770
TALIESIN: No, another just--

02:16:31.887 --> 02:16:34.907
MARISHA: Crests.
LAURA: They said more crests, right?

02:16:34.907 --> 02:16:37.127
SAM: But she didn't say any other type of item.

02:16:37.127 --> 02:16:39.897
So it's just crests that we know of.

02:16:39.897 --> 02:16:41.237
TALIESIN: I think it's probably more,

02:16:41.237 --> 02:16:44.627
but then again, it's not like she can't lie or not know.

02:16:46.327 --> 02:16:49.347
The trouble with this is they can say whatever they like.

02:16:52.197 --> 02:16:57.097
You do your best to gain trust, but it's a crapshoot.

02:16:57.097 --> 02:16:59.937
SAM: How many days are we away from A2?

02:16:59.937 --> 02:17:01.187
LAURA: One day.
MATT: One day.

02:17:01.187 --> 02:17:02.087
LAURA: Be there tomorrow.

02:17:02.087 --> 02:17:04.119
LIAM: One day more.

02:17:04.119 --> 02:17:09.070
TALIESIN: I'm going to stick my
head out and just for giggles,

02:17:11.847 --> 02:17:12.877
poke Locate Creature,

02:17:12.877 --> 02:17:15.865
to see if Lucien's within a thousand feet.

02:17:16.877 --> 02:17:18.437
LAURA: You're going to peep your head out

02:17:18.437 --> 02:17:20.970
of the tower first, right?

02:17:22.327 --> 02:17:24.827
They would have had to travel pretty fast to--

02:17:24.827 --> 02:17:25.993
TALIESIN: Yeah, they would.

02:17:25.993 --> 02:17:29.537
MATT: Well, as you lean outside of the entrance,

02:17:29.537 --> 02:17:31.777
your mind reaching out magically

02:17:31.777 --> 02:17:35.507
for the possible presence of Lucien, the Nonagon

02:17:37.513 --> 02:17:40.300
and the cold wind that's blowing the lightless night,

02:17:41.827 --> 02:17:43.147
you sense nothing.

02:17:43.147 --> 02:17:45.163
TALIESIN: I pop back in.

02:17:45.163 --> 02:17:48.513
He's either very, very much ahead
of us or reasonably behind us.

02:17:50.296 --> 02:17:51.537
LIAM: All right.

02:17:51.537 --> 02:17:52.947
LAURA: Should I send a message to Essek?

02:17:52.947 --> 02:17:54.047
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:17:54.907 --> 02:17:57.185
SAM: Saying what?

02:17:57.185 --> 02:17:59.187
Just... bad guys are coming.

02:17:59.187 --> 02:18:01.807
LAURA: Bad guys are coming.
SAM: Find a crest and hide it.

02:18:01.807 --> 02:18:04.147
TALIESIN: They're going to summon something dangerous

02:18:04.147 --> 02:18:07.897
and it's going to be bigger than anyone can handle.

02:18:07.897 --> 02:18:09.047
LAURA: We have to stop them.

02:18:09.047 --> 02:18:10.713
TALIESIN: And--
LIAM: Yeah.

02:18:10.713 --> 02:18:11.557
LAURA: Okay.

02:18:11.557 --> 02:18:13.482
LIAM: People are here. They are not the Empire.

02:18:13.482 --> 02:18:15.707
They are not the Dynasty, they're...

02:18:16.541 --> 02:18:20.667
outsiders, and all we know is they are dangerous,

02:18:20.667 --> 02:18:21.825
which is the truth.

02:18:25.027 --> 02:18:26.283
LAURA: Okay.

02:18:26.283 --> 02:18:27.726
I'll send a message to Essek.

02:18:27.726 --> 02:18:28.826
MATT: All right.

02:18:30.897 --> 02:18:32.818
We should hit A2 tomorrow.

02:18:36.554 --> 02:18:38.479
TRAVIS: A2... tomorrow.

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:44.122
There's a group...

02:18:45.938 --> 02:18:48.254
of villains on the way.

02:18:49.427 --> 02:18:51.533
We have to stop them, Essek.

02:18:55.887 --> 02:19:00.173
They plan to release something terrible.

02:19:05.127 --> 02:19:09.527
MATT: "Well, you portend something...

02:19:11.310 --> 02:19:12.576
"frightful.

02:19:16.227 --> 02:19:19.529
"I have my responsibilities, but...

02:19:21.246 --> 02:19:26.054
"if I can be of aid, please let me know.

02:19:27.407 --> 02:19:28.990
"I trust your guts."

02:19:34.159 --> 02:19:36.584
LAURA: He says he'll help, if we need him.

02:19:47.887 --> 02:19:49.617
I'm going to go to bed.

02:19:49.617 --> 02:19:50.450
MATT: Okay.

02:19:51.397 --> 02:19:52.837
TALIESIN: We are exhausted.

02:19:53.687 --> 02:19:55.637
MATT: The rest of you as well?

02:19:55.637 --> 02:19:57.087
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:19:57.087 --> 02:20:01.017
TRAVIS: I--I'm going to make my way over to Jester's room.

02:20:01.017 --> 02:20:02.277
MATT: Okay.

02:20:02.277 --> 02:20:04.010
TRAVIS: And knock on the door.

02:20:05.047 --> 02:20:07.166
SAM: She goes to bed at eight o'clock now.

02:20:07.166 --> 02:20:09.399
LAURA: Yeah, 6:00.
TRAVIS: She's so old.

02:20:09.399 --> 02:20:10.917
LAURA: Early early dinner.

02:20:10.917 --> 02:20:13.107
TRAVIS: I hear the Game Show Network inside the room.

02:20:13.107 --> 02:20:15.348
(laughter)

02:20:15.348 --> 02:20:17.337
LAURA: I'm asleep.

02:20:17.337 --> 02:20:18.987
LIAM: She gave up sugar today, did you know?

02:20:23.237 --> 02:20:24.657
SAM: See her teeth.

02:20:24.657 --> 02:20:25.571
LAURA: Hello?

02:20:25.571 --> 02:20:28.287
(laughter)

02:20:28.287 --> 02:20:29.570
TRAVIS: Just gummin' it.
LAURA: Hello?

02:20:32.261 --> 02:20:33.236
TRAVIS: Um...

02:20:36.047 --> 02:20:39.620
I was really worried about you when you fell.

02:20:43.917 --> 02:20:45.407
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:45.407 --> 02:20:47.107
TRAVIS: It suddenly feels far more serious

02:20:47.107 --> 02:20:49.457
than I thought it might be.

02:20:49.457 --> 02:20:50.290
LAURA: I know.

02:20:51.157 --> 02:20:53.667
I can't get the image of it out of my head.

02:20:57.817 --> 02:20:59.155
It's scary.

02:21:02.477 --> 02:21:04.234
TRAVIS: What do you think will happen?

02:21:06.817 --> 02:21:09.325
LAURA: I think if they bring it back it will, um...

02:21:12.749 --> 02:21:14.807
it will absorb everything it can.

02:21:15.657 --> 02:21:19.865
It felt like all of the people that lived there, like...

02:21:21.848 --> 02:21:23.398
Like they were part of the city now.

02:21:23.398 --> 02:21:24.697
Like they could never escape.

02:21:24.697 --> 02:21:25.947
It felt like hell.

02:21:25.947 --> 02:21:27.072
It felt...

02:21:28.121 --> 02:21:29.287
like torment.

02:21:33.168 --> 02:21:35.997
TRAVIS: And we have to stop it, right?

02:21:35.997 --> 02:21:36.830
LAURA: Yeah.

02:21:40.416 --> 02:21:43.041
TRAVIS: I--I may have a-- a problem.

02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:45.663
Um--
LAURA: What is it?

02:21:49.537 --> 02:21:53.003
TRAVIS: I saw you standing on that pillar, and...

02:21:55.178 --> 02:21:57.744
it was the first time where I kept myself

02:21:57.744 --> 02:22:02.419
from trying to stop something that was

02:22:02.419 --> 02:22:03.644
happening <i>to</i> you,

02:22:03.644 --> 02:22:08.644
and I didn't do anything and it's bothered me.

02:22:08.834 --> 02:22:10.834
LAURA: You couldn't have done anything, Fjord.

02:22:13.027 --> 02:22:15.493
It was in my head, y-you know?

02:22:18.427 --> 02:22:22.125
TRAVIS: Yes, I don't want you to gamble with yourself.

02:22:27.707 --> 02:22:30.910
I know we were playing and it didn't seem like much,

02:22:32.382 --> 02:22:35.208
and it seems to have exacted a pretty serious toll.

02:22:36.967 --> 02:22:41.387
All I'm saying is I want you to be careful as we do this.

02:22:41.387 --> 02:22:43.277
I don't think we'll be the spectators

02:22:43.277 --> 02:22:45.410
that we thought we might be.

02:22:51.568 --> 02:22:52.401
LAURA: Okay.

02:22:54.627 --> 02:22:55.737
TRAVIS: I want to come out of this

02:22:55.737 --> 02:22:57.387
and be able to go back to the sea

02:22:57.387 --> 02:23:01.027
and go back to Nicodranas and go back to where it's warm

02:23:01.027 --> 02:23:03.397
and not fucking freezing, and...

02:23:05.507 --> 02:23:06.515
LAURA: Me, too.

02:23:08.827 --> 02:23:10.470
TRAVIS: I just don't know if that's--

02:23:13.737 --> 02:23:15.673
I don't feel as optimistic now.

02:23:18.217 --> 02:23:19.450
LAURA: Me neither.

02:23:21.297 --> 02:23:22.130
But...

02:23:26.947 --> 02:23:28.813
I'll try to be safe.

02:23:30.530 --> 02:23:31.738
And you should, too.

02:23:34.897 --> 02:23:36.885
But if it comes down to it, if...

02:23:38.291 --> 02:23:40.217
if it means stopping that thing,

02:23:45.067 --> 02:23:46.750
I want to stop that thing.

02:23:50.697 --> 02:23:53.280
TRAVIS: I told your mother I would look after you.

02:23:56.701 --> 02:23:58.707
LAURA: Yeah, we'll be fine, Fjord.

02:24:00.167 --> 02:24:01.478
We always are.

02:24:06.367 --> 02:24:08.017
TRAVIS: I care very much for you.

02:24:11.287 --> 02:24:12.120
LAURA: Really?

02:24:21.147 --> 02:24:24.215
Is it because I have chiseled cheekbones now?

02:24:24.215 --> 02:24:25.380
TRAVIS: It's the longer horns.

02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:27.387
LAURA: Yeah, it's really does it, doesn't it?

02:24:27.387 --> 02:24:28.332
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: (laughs)

02:24:28.332 --> 02:24:30.254
TRAVIS: It gives you an intimidating look.

02:24:30.254 --> 02:24:31.979
LAURA: (giggles)

02:24:31.979 --> 02:24:33.337
TRAVIS: And I pull her in.

02:24:37.147 --> 02:24:39.138
Can I kiss you?
LAURA: (laughs, gasps)

02:24:44.647 --> 02:24:45.480
I kiss her.

02:24:51.304 --> 02:24:55.160
I don't-- I don't know how this will go,

02:24:57.477 --> 02:24:58.437
but I can't promise

02:24:58.437 --> 02:25:01.795
that I'm going to let you just throw yourself at this thing.

02:25:06.567 --> 02:25:08.100
I don't think I can do that.

02:25:16.577 --> 02:25:18.368
LAURA: I don't have an argument.

02:25:23.957 --> 02:25:27.282
Kissing is a lot more fun when you're not dying. (sniffles)

02:25:28.507 --> 02:25:30.199
TRAVIS: And not when you're underwater drowning.

02:25:30.199 --> 02:25:32.419
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.

02:25:38.698 --> 02:25:41.665
I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.901
TRAVIS: I've wanted to do it for a while.

02:25:46.901 --> 02:25:48.727
I'm kind of a big coward.

02:25:48.727 --> 02:25:51.080
LAURA: No, Fjord, you're very brave.

02:25:52.387 --> 02:25:54.417
TRAVIS: I <i>am</i> very brave, aren't I?

02:25:54.417 --> 02:25:55.650
LAURA: (quietly) You are.

02:25:58.847 --> 02:26:01.170
TRAVIS: I feel a bit better.

02:26:02.117 --> 02:26:03.200
LAURA: Me, too.

02:26:07.037 --> 02:26:08.903
TRAVIS: Are we sure we have to go fight this city?

02:26:08.903 --> 02:26:10.653
LAURA: We have to go fight the city.
TRAVIS: We could just leave. Maybe we can--

02:26:10.653 --> 02:26:12.177
LAURA: We have to fight it for...
TRAVIS: -- stay in the tower.

02:26:12.177 --> 02:26:13.919
Get cats and just flee.

02:26:13.919 --> 02:26:15.667
LAURA: We have to fight it.

02:26:15.667 --> 02:26:16.500
TRAVIS: All right.

02:26:21.777 --> 02:26:23.177
I'll see you in the morning.

02:26:24.357 --> 02:26:25.190
LAURA: Okay.

02:26:26.847 --> 02:26:28.137
TRAVIS: Goodnight.

02:26:28.137 --> 02:26:29.512
LAURA: Goodnight, Fjord.

02:26:31.557 --> 02:26:33.223
TRAVIS: I'll leave.

02:26:33.223 --> 02:26:35.223
LAURA: (sighs)

02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:39.863
(giggles)

02:26:39.863 --> 02:26:40.946
I'll go...

02:26:42.072 --> 02:26:43.777
Just go lay in bed

02:26:43.777 --> 02:26:47.497
and hold up my little unicorn figurine

02:26:48.657 --> 02:26:50.257
and fall asleep holding it.

02:26:52.877 --> 02:26:54.279
TRAVIS: I don't sleep much.

02:26:54.279 --> 02:26:56.396
(laughter)

02:26:57.817 --> 02:26:59.367
MATT: And as the rest of you find sleep

02:26:59.367 --> 02:27:01.707
in your corresponding chambers,

02:27:01.707 --> 02:27:04.277
closing the final night before your arrival

02:27:04.277 --> 02:27:07.307
at the second Aeorian excavation,

02:27:07.307 --> 02:27:08.254
we're going to take a break.

02:27:08.254 --> 02:27:09.517
MARISHA: (giggling)
ASHLEY: Yeah!

02:27:09.517 --> 02:27:10.500
MATT: We'll be back here--

02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:13.517
MARISHA: Yeah!
MATT: -- in a few minutes to pick up from there.

02:27:14.807 --> 02:27:16.059
MARISHA: Love is real!

02:27:16.059 --> 02:27:17.649
LAURA: This guy did it!

02:27:17.649 --> 02:27:19.145
MATT: You did it!

02:27:19.145 --> 02:27:22.853
The guy who never said he'd roleplay romance

02:27:22.853 --> 02:27:26.025
initiated! I'm proud of you, buddy!

02:27:26.025 --> 02:27:28.110
LAURA: Look, he's turning red!

02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:30.010
(laughter)
TALIESIN: -- takes five years.

02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:31.234
ASHLEY: He's all red!

02:27:31.234 --> 02:27:32.268
MARISHA: I know!

02:27:32.268 --> 02:27:35.064
MATT: <i>This</i> is character growth.

02:27:36.037 --> 02:27:37.997
Like, I'm not talking about Fjord.

02:27:37.997 --> 02:27:39.836
I'm talking about Travis.

02:27:39.836 --> 02:27:41.140
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:27:42.169 --> 02:27:44.457
SAM: He's hiding his face. He can't take it.
MATT: I know.

02:27:44.457 --> 02:27:45.407
TRAVIS: Good, it's good.

02:27:45.407 --> 02:27:46.747
MATT: And how was it?

02:27:46.747 --> 02:27:47.580
TRAVIS: It was great.

02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:49.775
(laughter)

02:27:49.775 --> 02:27:51.426
MATT: All righty, we'll see you
guys back here in a few minutes.

02:27:54.483 --> 02:27:56.633
Hey critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:27:56.633 --> 02:27:59.036
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:28:01.353 --> 02:28:02.593
I mean, the traveler always says

02:28:02.593 --> 02:28:04.946
impulse purchases are a good decision.

02:28:05.932 --> 02:28:07.243
(trickling)

02:28:07.243 --> 02:28:09.133
It's perfect for the home,

02:28:09.133 --> 02:28:12.024
or the office, or your bathroom.

02:28:12.024 --> 02:28:13.543
(chimes)

02:28:13.543 --> 02:28:16.386
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:28:17.462 --> 02:28:18.823
(tearing)

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:20.603
Ooh, look at this.

02:28:20.603 --> 02:28:22.686
Look at the details, ooh.

02:28:24.883 --> 02:28:26.203
These holidays, you know,

02:28:26.203 --> 02:28:27.753
they're just around the corner.

02:28:30.833 --> 02:28:31.666
(click)

02:28:31.666 --> 02:28:34.121
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:28:34.121 --> 02:28:35.073
(laughs) Don't worry,

02:28:35.073 --> 02:28:36.643
there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:28:36.643 --> 02:28:37.593
You still got time.

02:28:41.023 --> 02:28:43.856
(orchestra music)

02:28:45.099 --> 02:28:46.120
(beeping)

02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:47.623
(tearing)

02:28:47.623 --> 02:28:49.893
Jester is screwed.

02:28:49.893 --> 02:28:53.113
It takes her 20 minutes just to cross the street

02:28:53.113 --> 02:28:55.368
and another 10 to find the building.

02:28:55.368 --> 02:28:57.618
(laughing)

02:29:01.743 --> 02:29:04.573
Oh God, this was so hysterically funny.

02:29:04.573 --> 02:29:08.923
Aah, (laughs) (sniffs) and I'm punchy.

02:29:08.923 --> 02:29:09.993
Aha (beep).

02:29:09.993 --> 02:29:13.603
It takes her 20 minutes just to cross the street

02:29:13.603 --> 02:29:16.303
and another 10 to find the building.

02:29:16.303 --> 02:29:18.506
When she finally gets to the second floor,

02:29:19.681 --> 02:29:21.931
(laughing)

02:29:24.190 --> 02:29:27.341
(inhale) (sigh)

02:29:27.341 --> 02:29:28.673
(beep) All right, get it together.

02:29:28.673 --> 02:29:29.875
Get it together, here we go.

02:29:29.875 --> 02:29:33.681
(sniffs) (clears throat)

02:29:33.681 --> 02:29:37.313
(laugh) (beep) When she finally gets to the second floor,

02:29:37.313 --> 02:29:40.493
she manages to land in a curtained window,

02:29:40.493 --> 02:29:43.549
but then, she spends another 20 minutes

02:29:43.549 --> 02:29:46.491
(laughing)
eating the curtains.

02:29:46.491 --> 02:29:48.741
(laughing)

02:30:02.623 --> 02:30:05.456
(laughing louder)

02:30:07.470 --> 02:30:09.046
Oh God,

02:30:09.046 --> 02:30:11.517
it's so (beep) funny.

02:30:11.517 --> 02:30:13.767
(laughing)

02:30:16.224 --> 02:30:18.641
(rock music)

02:30:22.168 --> 02:30:23.610
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:30:23.610 --> 02:30:25.623
Yeah, we did it, yeah!

02:30:25.623 --> 02:30:26.713
Sam Riegel,

02:30:26.713 --> 02:30:27.893
you just won the Super Bowl.

02:30:27.893 --> 02:30:29.043
What are you gonna do now?

02:30:29.043 --> 02:30:31.867
I'm subscribing to Critical Role, yeah!

02:30:31.867 --> 02:30:32.823
Wonderful, and that's-

02:30:32.823 --> 02:30:34.743
It's about perseverance,

02:30:34.743 --> 02:30:36.408
like remembering to resubscribe

02:30:36.408 --> 02:30:38.643
with Twitch Prime every month, yeah!

02:30:38.643 --> 02:30:40.153
(whooping)
Well could you

02:30:40.153 --> 02:30:41.613
What, have done it without my teammates?

02:30:41.613 --> 02:30:43.043
Come on, no way!

02:30:43.043 --> 02:30:44.513
And they couldn't have done it without

02:30:44.513 --> 02:30:46.943
the Twitch subscriptions that I gave them.

02:30:46.943 --> 02:30:47.793
Right, guys?

02:30:47.793 --> 02:30:48.923
Yeah!
Okay, Sam,

02:30:48.923 --> 02:30:50.083
but, what about,

02:30:50.083 --> 02:30:51.273
Oh, what about, what about

02:30:51.273 --> 02:30:53.003
what inspires me, you mean?

02:30:53.003 --> 02:30:55.073
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

02:30:55.073 --> 02:30:57.033
I mean, watching that dehydrated

02:30:57.033 --> 02:30:59.363
piece of string cheese, Brian Foster,

02:30:59.363 --> 02:31:00.583
every couple of weeks

02:31:00.583 --> 02:31:02.941
really gets me pumped for the big game!

02:31:02.941 --> 02:31:04.133
(laughing)
Sam, hold on.

02:31:04.133 --> 02:31:05.523
We have to (buzzer)

02:31:05.523 --> 02:31:06.593
You can't believe it?

02:31:06.593 --> 02:31:08.023
You can't believe it, is that what you said?

02:31:08.023 --> 02:31:10.933
Well, it's true, because every Yee-Haw VOD

02:31:10.933 --> 02:31:13.893
is instantly available as soon as you subscribe.

02:31:13.893 --> 02:31:14.973
It's amazing!

02:31:14.973 --> 02:31:15.913
Sam!
We did it, guys!

02:31:15.913 --> 02:31:18.521
Sam!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:31:18.521 --> 02:31:19.354
What? Sorry.

02:31:19.354 --> 02:31:21.423
Just say I'm going to Disneyland.

02:31:21.423 --> 02:31:23.503
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

02:31:23.503 --> 02:31:24.336
Oh,

02:31:25.363 --> 02:31:28.233
uh, (spurt)

02:31:28.233 --> 02:31:29.341
what's at Disneyland?

02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:31.478
(dramatic music)

02:31:31.478 --> 02:31:33.645
(whistle)

02:31:36.085 --> 02:31:38.113
I dunno, I gotta be honest with you.

02:31:38.113 --> 02:31:38.963
Oh!

02:31:38.963 --> 02:31:41.623
I got hit in the head pretty hard out there.

02:31:41.623 --> 02:31:42.533
Oh my God.

02:31:42.533 --> 02:31:44.129
Woo!

02:31:44.129 --> 02:31:46.030
I'm not good at sports.

02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:47.947
(thud)

02:31:48.873 --> 02:31:50.956
(cheers)

02:45:00.334 --> 02:45:01.242
MATT: Welcome back.

02:45:01.242 --> 02:45:03.345
(laughing)

02:45:03.345 --> 02:45:04.178
TALIESIN: Shit.

02:45:05.625 --> 02:45:07.645
TRAVIS: Are we even trying?

02:45:07.645 --> 02:45:08.816
TALIESIN: No.

02:45:08.816 --> 02:45:09.835
ASHLEY: She's like, I got a good one!

02:45:09.835 --> 02:45:10.968
Oh, we're already on.

02:45:10.968 --> 02:45:12.815
(laughter)

02:45:12.815 --> 02:45:14.425
MATT: Welcome back.

02:45:14.425 --> 02:45:18.495
So after you all complete your evening's rest,

02:45:18.495 --> 02:45:21.443
you all gather for breakfast the next morning.

02:45:23.705 --> 02:45:26.646
Some probably a little more awkward than others.

02:45:26.646 --> 02:45:28.865
TRAVIS: What do you mean?
LAURA: What are you talking about?

02:45:28.865 --> 02:45:33.325
MATT: But nevertheless, meals are
had, supplies are gathered,

02:45:33.325 --> 02:45:36.509
and Dagen preps to take you out once more

02:45:36.509 --> 02:45:40.285
into the icy tundra towards your nearby destination

02:45:40.285 --> 02:45:41.935
of the A2 excavation.

02:45:41.935 --> 02:45:43.165
So, do you have everything you need?

02:45:43.165 --> 02:45:44.445
Anything you wish to do before you leave?

02:45:44.445 --> 02:45:45.719
Or...?

02:45:45.719 --> 02:45:47.641
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh, we have to check in.

02:45:47.641 --> 02:45:49.135
We have to check back in.

02:45:49.135 --> 02:45:52.838
MARISHA: Yes, with Yudala Fon, please.

02:45:54.305 --> 02:45:55.138
SAM: Jester.

02:45:55.138 --> 02:45:55.971
LAURA: Yes?

02:45:55.971 --> 02:45:59.065
SAM: Jester, I found this pill box.

02:45:59.065 --> 02:46:01.295
Do you take all of these now?

02:46:01.295 --> 02:46:03.805
LAURA: Yeah, I need them all.

02:46:03.805 --> 02:46:04.638
SAM: Wow.

02:46:04.638 --> 02:46:06.005
LAURA: Yeah, my doctor recommends.

02:46:06.005 --> 02:46:07.215
SAM: Okay.

02:46:07.215 --> 02:46:08.595
LAURA: I have a high blood pressure.

02:46:08.595 --> 02:46:12.707
TRAVIS: I have metamucil and Grape
Nuts in the breakfast mix.

02:46:12.707 --> 02:46:14.445
SAM: What's this can of liquid?

02:46:14.445 --> 02:46:16.634
LIAM: There's one for everyday.

02:46:16.634 --> 02:46:17.667
SAM: Oh yes.

02:46:17.667 --> 02:46:21.450
LIAM: <i>Montag, Dienstag, Mittwoch, Donnerstag, ja.</i>

02:46:21.450 --> 02:46:22.405
ASHLEY: Grape Nuts are good.

02:46:22.405 --> 02:46:23.238
LAURA: Grape Nuts <i>are</i> good.

02:46:23.238 --> 02:46:24.071
TALIESIN: They are good.

02:46:24.071 --> 02:46:24.904
MARISHA: <i>Are</i> they?
LIAM: For your bowels.

02:46:24.904 --> 02:46:26.005
TRAVIS: Then you're a crazy person.

02:46:26.005 --> 02:46:27.154
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:46:27.154 --> 02:46:28.395
TRAVIS: That's gravel and milk.

02:46:28.395 --> 02:46:29.228
MARISHA: That's bullshit.

02:46:29.228 --> 02:46:31.305
LAURA: I used to eat Grape Nuts, but you have to pour sugar

02:46:31.305 --> 02:46:32.569
over the top of them.

02:46:32.569 --> 02:46:34.169
TRAVIS: Wow.
MARISHA: Right, because they suck.

02:46:34.169 --> 02:46:37.108
MATT: Yeah, there's certain cereals,

02:46:37.108 --> 02:46:39.427
you're just taking penance.

02:46:39.427 --> 02:46:41.605
Like you're trying to make up for something

02:46:41.605 --> 02:46:43.664
you did wrong in your life. And this
is your way of feeling better.

02:46:43.664 --> 02:46:46.995
LAURA: Grape Nuts feel like they never go away in the bowl.

02:46:46.995 --> 02:46:49.505
Like as you eat them, they stay, they regenerate.

02:46:49.505 --> 02:46:51.396
ASHLEY: You can't see it. It just looks like milk.

02:46:51.396 --> 02:46:53.430
MATT: Like I said, penance.
TRAVIS: Sediment.

02:46:53.430 --> 02:46:55.277
TALIESIN: I used to pretend I was the rock guy.

02:46:55.277 --> 02:46:56.827
SAM: This combat brought to you by Grape Nuts.

02:46:56.827 --> 02:46:59.832
MATT: So anyway, is there anything else you would wish to do

02:46:59.832 --> 02:47:02.955
before you make to the next leg of your adventurous journey?

02:47:02.955 --> 02:47:05.227
LIAM: (like Jester) I'm just exfoliating my colon.

02:47:05.227 --> 02:47:07.198
(laughter)

02:47:07.198 --> 02:47:08.955
MATT: Exfoliniating?

02:47:08.955 --> 02:47:09.935
All righty.

02:47:09.935 --> 02:47:12.235
LAURA: Yes, we're sending a message to Yudala Fon.

02:47:12.235 --> 02:47:13.505
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: All right.

02:47:14.935 --> 02:47:16.235
LAURA: Is there anything else you want me to say, Beau?

02:47:16.235 --> 02:47:18.745
Or is it just: What did you find?

02:47:18.745 --> 02:47:20.033
MARISHA: Oh, right.

02:47:21.235 --> 02:47:22.068
SAM: She's got the info.

02:47:22.068 --> 02:47:24.075
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't-- I didn't--

02:47:24.075 --> 02:47:25.105
it would take me a minute.
LAURA: Okay, that's fine.

02:47:25.105 --> 02:47:25.938
MARISHA: Okay.

02:47:27.135 --> 02:47:28.395
LAURA: Checking back in.

02:47:28.395 --> 02:47:30.905
What did you find?

02:47:30.905 --> 02:47:32.225
If you don't have enough words,

02:47:32.225 --> 02:47:35.585
find someone that can send a message to Beau.

02:47:35.585 --> 02:47:36.715
It's a spell.

02:47:36.715 --> 02:47:39.156
I'm sure they can figure it out.

02:47:39.156 --> 02:47:39.989
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:47:39.989 --> 02:47:41.872
TALIESIN: So they can figure--

02:47:41.872 --> 02:47:43.863
MATT: The response comes to you.

02:47:45.085 --> 02:47:46.388
"Good morning.

02:47:47.372 --> 02:47:51.730
"It was difficult to research, but we found something.

02:47:53.655 --> 02:47:57.713
"Records say, of the multiple wards

02:47:57.713 --> 02:48:01.454
"of the lost city of Aeor,

02:48:01.454 --> 02:48:05.465
"the Cognouza Ward was a section of the city."

02:48:05.465 --> 02:48:07.124
LAURA: Cognouza Ward.

02:48:08.461 --> 02:48:09.826
Cognouza Ward?

02:48:09.826 --> 02:48:12.710
MARISHA: Cognouza Ward.

02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:14.938
SAM: So it was just a neighborhood. It's a neighborhood.

02:48:14.938 --> 02:48:16.586
It's not a person. It's not a thing.

02:48:16.586 --> 02:48:18.395
It's a neighborhood.

02:48:18.395 --> 02:48:22.205
MATT: To which a follow up message comes to you.

02:48:22.205 --> 02:48:23.735
LAURA: Wait, send it to Beau.

02:48:23.735 --> 02:48:25.025
I guess it sends to me.

02:48:25.025 --> 02:48:26.255
MARISHA: Whichever works. It's fine,

02:48:26.255 --> 02:48:27.968
as long as the information gets through.

02:48:27.968 --> 02:48:30.425
MATT: Continuing the conversation
to you, just because it's--

02:48:30.425 --> 02:48:31.258
LAURA: It's weird.

02:48:31.258 --> 02:48:33.105
MATT: It's weird otherwise. Be
like finish half a conversation

02:48:33.105 --> 02:48:34.555
one person to the next.

02:48:36.745 --> 02:48:37.895
"Somnovum--"

02:48:37.895 --> 02:48:39.375
LAURA: Somnovum.

02:48:39.375 --> 02:48:41.205
MATT: "-- has something to do with the leadership

02:48:41.205 --> 02:48:43.083
"of that particular ward.

02:48:47.575 --> 02:48:49.362
"That is all that we have."

02:48:50.776 --> 02:48:52.095
LAURA: That was super helpful.

02:48:52.095 --> 02:48:54.315
MARISHA: That is awesome.

02:48:54.315 --> 02:48:55.148
LAURA: Thank you so much.

02:48:55.148 --> 02:48:57.575
Beau is super excited about that information.

02:48:57.575 --> 02:48:58.735
You rock!

02:48:58.735 --> 02:48:59.568
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:48:59.568 --> 02:49:00.401
LAURA: Talk soon.

02:49:01.675 --> 02:49:03.042
MATT: No further response.

02:49:05.355 --> 02:49:08.460
You sense likely some appreciation from that end.

02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:09.293
(chuckles)

02:49:09.293 --> 02:49:13.845
MARISHA: The minds of Cognouza orchestrated its escape.

02:49:13.845 --> 02:49:16.060
So, like some sort of mage--

02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:17.275
LIAM: It's a Cerberus Assembly of its time.

02:49:17.275 --> 02:49:19.265
MARISHA: Yes, 100 percent.

02:49:19.265 --> 02:49:22.755
TRAVIS: And they jettisoned their own neighborhood

02:49:22.755 --> 02:49:25.395
while Aeor was being destroyed,

02:49:25.395 --> 02:49:27.435
or Aeor jettisoned them?

02:49:27.435 --> 02:49:31.215
LIAM: Or maybe they brought down Aeor,

02:49:31.215 --> 02:49:32.895
contrary to popular belief--

02:49:32.895 --> 02:49:35.455
TRAVIS: From inside.
LIAM: -- to somehow save themselves.

02:49:35.455 --> 02:49:37.425
TALIESIN: Maybe they figured out how to save themselves

02:49:37.425 --> 02:49:42.425
and the people in that ward by destroying everything.

02:49:42.795 --> 02:49:44.275
LAURA: The rest of the city or something?

02:49:44.275 --> 02:49:45.695
TALIESIN: Or at least turning themselves

02:49:45.695 --> 02:49:48.385
into something that could survive.

02:49:48.385 --> 02:49:49.218
LAURA: Yeah.

02:49:49.218 --> 02:49:51.755
LIAM: I'm sure they had very good rationalizations

02:49:51.755 --> 02:49:52.985
for themselves.

02:49:52.985 --> 02:49:54.595
MARISHA: Why bring back the Somnovum?

02:49:54.595 --> 02:49:56.935
"To become one of the great minds."

02:49:56.935 --> 02:49:57.880
LAURA: Okay.

02:50:01.105 --> 02:50:01.938
All right.

02:50:03.625 --> 02:50:05.077
We should, we should--

02:50:05.077 --> 02:50:06.875
TRAVIS: We're so ready for this.

02:50:06.875 --> 02:50:11.345
LAURA: Just head to A2
and try to get to a crest.

02:50:11.345 --> 02:50:15.335
LIAM: What's better than one all powerful circle of mages,

02:50:15.335 --> 02:50:19.391
but two all powerful circles of mages?

02:50:19.391 --> 02:50:20.526
SAM: Are we one of the two?

02:50:20.526 --> 02:50:21.726
LIAM: No, we are not.

02:50:21.726 --> 02:50:25.125
MARISHA: Are you including the Dynasty? Is that the third?

02:50:25.125 --> 02:50:26.852
Or is that, like, a broken one?

02:50:26.852 --> 02:50:27.995
You know what, let's not count mages.

02:50:27.995 --> 02:50:30.217
TALIESIN: That's like a half circle.

02:50:30.217 --> 02:50:32.005
LIAM: They are our ancestors.

02:50:32.005 --> 02:50:32.838
MARISHA: Ah!

02:50:35.235 --> 02:50:36.801
Let's press on.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:50:37.641 --> 02:50:38.972
SAM: A2.

02:50:38.972 --> 02:50:40.931
TRAVIS: A2.
MATT: (as Dagen) "All right.

02:50:40.931 --> 02:50:43.464
"Get your shit and follow."

02:50:43.464 --> 02:50:46.165
He pushes his way out in the snow. You all follow suit

02:50:46.165 --> 02:50:48.788
and begin the final leg of your trek.

02:50:50.045 --> 02:50:53.775
You continue on for roughly three or so hours

02:50:53.775 --> 02:50:55.665
before you find yourselves approaching--

02:50:55.665 --> 02:50:57.145
SAM: Do we lose our exhaustion?

02:50:57.145 --> 02:50:58.185
MATT: You do, yes.

02:50:58.185 --> 02:50:59.776
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:50:59.776 --> 02:51:01.201
MATT: You're now good.

02:51:03.731 --> 02:51:06.795
You begin to approach a small, jagged range

02:51:06.795 --> 02:51:10.945
of rocky hills and small spires that seem to peek

02:51:10.945 --> 02:51:12.308
through the snow and ice.

02:51:14.275 --> 02:51:16.395
Advancing up the rough slopes.

02:51:16.395 --> 02:51:20.035
Eventually, Dagen leads you to a rope climb

02:51:20.035 --> 02:51:25.035
to a small cliff face above.
He looks over to the rest of you.

02:51:25.630 --> 02:51:27.225
"All the previous times I've brought people here

02:51:27.225 --> 02:51:31.445
"for the trek, they all went up that way.

02:51:31.445 --> 02:51:32.919
"Come on." He goes and wraps the rope

02:51:32.919 --> 02:51:35.205
and then hand over hand lifts him

02:51:35.205 --> 02:51:37.898
and his chair up along the cliff face.

02:51:37.898 --> 02:51:38.731
TRAVIS: Damn.

02:51:38.731 --> 02:51:40.145
MATT: Before eventually getting to the edge

02:51:40.145 --> 02:51:42.745
and you can see there's like a metallic pike of some kind.

02:51:42.745 --> 02:51:43.855
It's jammed into the rock.

02:51:43.855 --> 02:51:46.795
And he uses that (groans) lift himself over,

02:51:46.795 --> 02:51:49.455
and then with one strong show of core strength,

02:51:49.455 --> 02:51:52.085
get him and the chair up onto the cliff face.

02:51:52.085 --> 02:51:53.205
"So you coming?"

02:51:53.205 --> 02:51:54.205
Then he wheels off.

02:51:54.205 --> 02:51:55.517
TRAVIS: Sure. Just like that.

02:51:55.517 --> 02:51:57.885
MARISHA: I want his upper body strength.

02:51:57.885 --> 02:51:59.875
LIAM: <i>I</i> want that core strength.
MARISHA: Can I have that?

02:51:59.875 --> 02:52:01.125
TALIESIN: That's very impressive.

02:52:02.227 --> 02:52:04.805
I'll go for it if no one else-- just,

02:52:04.805 --> 02:52:07.735
that way there's more people for me to fall on.

02:52:07.735 --> 02:52:08.905
Guidance.

02:52:08.905 --> 02:52:09.738
MATT: Go for it.

02:52:09.738 --> 02:52:11.408
TALIESIN: Is it acrobatics or--?

02:52:12.275 --> 02:52:14.585
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, it's a challenge.

02:52:14.585 --> 02:52:16.081
TALIESIN: Challenge.

02:52:16.081 --> 02:52:18.685
MATT: With a little bit of help with some of your friends,

02:52:18.685 --> 02:52:19.904
one by one, you can all make it there.

02:52:19.904 --> 02:52:21.735
I'm not going to have to make it a whole

02:52:21.735 --> 02:52:25.520
skill check to have to climb 25 feet.

02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:27.205
Though I love you jumping into it.

02:52:27.205 --> 02:52:29.426
TALIESIN: I would fall anyway,
which is why I as going to try to.

02:52:29.426 --> 02:52:30.586
(laughter)

02:52:30.586 --> 02:52:32.193
MATT: Fair enough. Fair enough.
TRAVIS: I'll catch you!

02:52:32.193 --> 02:52:33.855
MATT: To be fair, you could be Yasha's chair.

02:52:33.855 --> 02:52:35.885
She can probably carry you up the same way.

02:52:35.885 --> 02:52:37.155
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

02:52:38.310 --> 02:52:39.368
TRAVIS: Fezzik.

02:52:39.368 --> 02:52:40.335
MARISHA: Not using your legs.

02:52:40.335 --> 02:52:41.775
Yeah.
MATT: Yep.

02:52:41.775 --> 02:52:42.608
MARISHA: It's great.

02:52:42.608 --> 02:52:43.705
LIAM: You just stopped me from falling

02:52:43.705 --> 02:52:45.857
and turning into a T-Rex in response.

02:52:45.857 --> 02:52:47.515
(laughter)

02:52:47.515 --> 02:52:48.461
MATT: All right.

02:52:48.461 --> 02:52:50.185
LIAM: (impacts)
TRAVIS: (T-Rex roar)

02:52:50.185 --> 02:52:52.805
MATT: As you all eventually climb to the top,

02:52:52.805 --> 02:52:55.065
you only see before you this

02:52:56.085 --> 02:53:00.575
pockmarked snow and slate plateau at the top.

02:53:00.575 --> 02:53:02.145
Still jagged in places,

02:53:02.145 --> 02:53:03.965
but it seems to have leveled off at this point.

02:53:03.965 --> 02:53:06.989
And at first glance,

02:53:06.989 --> 02:53:11.639
you don't really see any signs of an excavation.

02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:16.325
MARISHA: I'd be careful where you step.

02:53:16.325 --> 02:53:18.416
SAM: It's just rocks everywhere?

02:53:18.416 --> 02:53:21.793
LAURA: Oh, the snow may have covered up the entrance.

02:53:21.793 --> 02:53:23.625
MARISHA: We just recently went through a snow storm.

02:53:23.625 --> 02:53:26.349
You don't want to fall through any crevices.

02:53:26.349 --> 02:53:28.448
MATT: Dagen looks over to you and goes,

02:53:28.448 --> 02:53:30.108
"That was very astute of you.

02:53:30.108 --> 02:53:31.985
"I did take one crew here once before

02:53:31.985 --> 02:53:35.326
"and they had a fellow that walked out and just vanished."

02:53:35.326 --> 02:53:36.815
TRAVIS: Ooh.

02:53:36.815 --> 02:53:38.587
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "I mean, they eventually found him,

02:53:38.587 --> 02:53:40.275
"a little broken on the bottom,

02:53:40.275 --> 02:53:42.862
"but somewhere around here there's a...

02:53:44.205 --> 02:53:48.692
"an illusory blanket hiding the entrance.

02:53:49.921 --> 02:53:51.116
"So just--"

02:53:52.024 --> 02:53:53.268
LAURA: How do we find it?

02:53:54.195 --> 02:53:55.028
MATT: "Carefully."

02:53:57.205 --> 02:53:59.125
LIAM: I'll throw up Detect Magic.

02:53:59.125 --> 02:54:00.165
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:54:00.165 --> 02:54:00.998
MATT: Okay.

02:54:00.998 --> 02:54:02.955
LIAM: And start slowly inching along.

02:54:02.955 --> 02:54:06.865
MATT: You detect a mass illusion that blocks

02:54:06.865 --> 02:54:10.235
a large portion of this region.

02:54:10.235 --> 02:54:12.295
It is permanently installed, it seems.

02:54:12.295 --> 02:54:13.128
LIAM: Okay.

02:54:14.465 --> 02:54:17.225
MATT: But you could try and scan through

02:54:17.225 --> 02:54:19.235
and see if you could peer through it for those who--

02:54:19.235 --> 02:54:20.176
LIAM: I will.
MATT: -- are of like mind.

02:54:20.176 --> 02:54:21.834
All right, make an investigation check.

02:54:23.185 --> 02:54:24.593
LAURA: Guidance. Just kidding.
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:54:24.593 --> 02:54:25.426
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.

02:54:25.426 --> 02:54:26.753
MATT: To a total of?

02:54:26.753 --> 02:54:29.948
LIAM: Oh, with investigation, 31.

02:54:29.948 --> 02:54:31.845
(oohing)

02:54:31.845 --> 02:54:33.435
MATT: With a brief glance, you immediately

02:54:33.435 --> 02:54:34.985
can see the pattern out there.

02:54:34.985 --> 02:54:38.335
And there's a little bit of a shimmer where, as you focus,

02:54:38.335 --> 02:54:41.405
you can see there's an echo in the shadow.

02:54:41.405 --> 02:54:45.875
And there you can tell there is a very faint opening.

02:54:45.875 --> 02:54:47.985
And once you see that, you point it out

02:54:47.985 --> 02:54:50.155
to everybody else and the illusion seems to almost,

02:54:50.155 --> 02:54:52.955
once you click in it-- it's like seeing a Magic Eye image,

02:54:52.955 --> 02:54:54.435
where once you focus, all of a sudden you're like,

02:54:54.435 --> 02:54:56.775
"Oh, that's been there the whole time."

02:54:56.775 --> 02:54:58.422
TALIESIN: Indiana Jones invisible bridge.

02:54:58.422 --> 02:54:59.745
MATT: Yeah, that kind of thing.

02:54:59.745 --> 02:55:01.153
TRAVIS: Good pull.
TALIESIN: I see what you did there.

02:55:01.153 --> 02:55:03.740
LIAM: I'd turn to the group and carefully say: Go!

02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:04.999
(laughter)

02:55:04.999 --> 02:55:06.781
TRAVIS: You bastard.
MARISHA: Go!

02:55:06.781 --> 02:55:09.575
MATT: Beneath this illusory self as you get low,

02:55:09.575 --> 02:55:11.355
you can actually look beneath the line,

02:55:11.355 --> 02:55:13.335
because as you walk towards it, you can see elements

02:55:13.335 --> 02:55:17.005
of your heels begin to absorb into the snowfall

02:55:17.005 --> 02:55:18.035
that's clouded the area,

02:55:18.035 --> 02:55:20.445
but there's no resistance in the snow.

02:55:20.445 --> 02:55:25.015
Peering beneath, you can see there is a 15-foot chasm,

02:55:25.015 --> 02:55:26.681
a little ways ahead of you.
LAURA: Whoa.

02:55:26.681 --> 02:55:28.965
MATT: That just descends directly below.

02:55:28.965 --> 02:55:30.340
And you can already see

02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:32.905
a rickety series of wooden steps and platforms

02:55:32.905 --> 02:55:35.395
that begin to spiral down the side.

02:55:35.395 --> 02:55:36.478
LAURA: Those look safe.

02:55:38.155 --> 02:55:40.933
SAM: Yeah, I mean, that's the way down, right?

02:55:40.933 --> 02:55:42.685
MATT: "Yeah, apparently. Y'all have fun.

02:55:42.685 --> 02:55:45.675
"I'm going to set up camp
somewhere around here out of sight."

02:55:45.675 --> 02:55:47.413
LAURA: Yes, hide.
TALIESIN: I was about to say,

02:55:47.413 --> 02:55:48.493
best be out of sight.

02:55:48.493 --> 02:55:52.575
LAURA: The last time we went up, they had killed the scout,

02:55:52.575 --> 02:55:55.653
the person that was standing guard, so.

02:55:55.653 --> 02:55:57.794
MATT: "Right. So the same folks that were out there,

02:55:57.794 --> 02:55:59.355
"they're coming as well?"

02:55:59.355 --> 02:56:00.615
TALIESIN: Probably.

02:56:00.615 --> 02:56:02.165
MATT: "Good to know, I'm going to be--

02:56:03.675 --> 02:56:05.922
"You can do that weird message thing, right?"

02:56:05.922 --> 02:56:06.775
LAURA: I can.

02:56:06.775 --> 02:56:08.545
MATT: "Just let me know when you're coming back

02:56:08.545 --> 02:56:10.391
"because I'm going to be a ways off."

02:56:10.391 --> 02:56:11.375
LAURA: Okay.

02:56:11.375 --> 02:56:13.865
MATT: "Stay in the sight, tucked away.

02:56:13.865 --> 02:56:16.090
"All right. Good luck, don't die."

02:56:17.694 --> 02:56:20.810
SAM: Thank you.
MATT: "If you do, just leave some gold.

02:56:20.810 --> 02:56:24.702
"All right," and he heads off in a--

02:56:24.702 --> 02:56:27.535
this would be an north-northwestern direction

02:56:27.535 --> 02:56:28.505
from where you currently stand

02:56:28.505 --> 02:56:31.340
and trying to find some path out of sight.

02:56:32.475 --> 02:56:37.191
So who would like to descend first and in what order?

02:56:38.366 --> 02:56:43.366
SAM: I'll go first and I'll look for traps.

02:56:44.165 --> 02:56:45.506
MATT: All right. Who'd be going after?

02:56:45.506 --> 02:56:47.183
There is just enough room to go single file

02:56:47.183 --> 02:56:49.815
around the edge of this chasm.

02:56:49.815 --> 02:56:51.775
So who would be next after?

02:56:51.775 --> 02:56:56.055
MARISHA: I look at Veth and I unbuckle my goggles.

02:56:56.055 --> 02:56:57.145
SAM: Oh, yes.

02:56:57.145 --> 02:56:58.845
MARISHA: Still not a gift.

02:56:58.845 --> 02:56:59.678
SAM: Sure.

02:56:59.678 --> 02:57:01.220
MARISHA: Just.

02:57:01.220 --> 02:57:02.053
SAM: Ah, I dropped it!

02:57:02.053 --> 02:57:03.195
MARISHA: Oh no!

02:57:03.195 --> 02:57:05.528
(laughter)

02:57:07.245 --> 02:57:09.083
TRAVIS: Wow, that could not have gone worse!

02:57:09.083 --> 02:57:10.679
(laughter)

02:57:10.679 --> 02:57:12.470
MARISHA: You're three feet away!

02:57:12.470 --> 02:57:14.915
SAM: Don't worry, Mage Hand. Got them.

02:57:14.915 --> 02:57:18.766
LIAM: A massive monster comes up through the rock.

02:57:18.766 --> 02:57:19.995
ASHLEY: I'll go next.

02:57:19.995 --> 02:57:22.707
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: I'll go after that.

02:57:22.707 --> 02:57:24.950
TRAVIS: I'll go.
MATT: So Beau, are you going after Veth?

02:57:24.950 --> 02:57:25.916
MARISHA: No.

02:57:25.916 --> 02:57:28.064
MATT: So Yasha. And then who's after Yasha?

02:57:28.064 --> 02:57:28.972
TALIESIN: I am.
LAURA: Caduceus.

02:57:28.972 --> 02:57:31.275
MATT: Caduceus, all righty.
TRAVIS: I'll go after you.

02:57:31.275 --> 02:57:32.108
LAURA: Okay.

02:57:32.108 --> 02:57:33.927
MATT: And then Jester.
MARISHA: Caleb's in the middle.

02:57:33.927 --> 02:57:36.214
LIAM: ♪ Caleb takes the rear ♪

02:57:36.214 --> 02:57:38.441
SAM: ♪ Caleb take the wheel ♪
MATT: And you go after Fjord, you said?

02:57:38.441 --> 02:57:40.278
MARISHA: I'll go last. I'll bring up the rear or something.

02:57:40.278 --> 02:57:43.187
SAM: ♪ Beau also takes the rear ♪
LIAM: What part of "Caleb takes the rear"?

02:57:43.187 --> 02:57:45.048
(laughter)

02:57:45.048 --> 02:57:46.899
SAM: ♪ There's two rears ♪

02:57:46.899 --> 02:57:49.585
(laughter)

02:57:49.585 --> 02:57:51.419
MATT: You guys get to decide who gets to be in the rear.

02:57:51.419 --> 02:57:52.459
LIAM: I mean, that's--

02:57:52.459 --> 02:57:53.476
TRAVIS: Boulder, Parchment, Shears.

02:57:53.476 --> 02:57:56.235
LAURA: (chanting) Boulder, Parchment, Shears!

02:57:56.235 --> 02:57:57.735
LIAM: I was just going to let her push me out of the way.

02:57:57.735 --> 02:57:58.718
LAURA: Oh, well, that works, too.

02:57:58.718 --> 02:58:00.046
LIAM: Whatever you like.

02:58:00.046 --> 02:58:01.146
MARISHA: Do you want to be-- I was just--

02:58:01.146 --> 02:58:03.584
squishy people in the middle, so...

02:58:03.584 --> 02:58:05.325
LIAM: Uh.

02:58:05.325 --> 02:58:07.878
MARISHA: Protecting what's most valuable, you know.

02:58:07.878 --> 02:58:09.365
LIAM: Boulder, Parchment, Shears.

02:58:09.365 --> 02:58:10.930
MARISHA: All right, all right, all right.

LIAM: It's weird with two people.

02:58:12.022 --> 02:58:13.135
MARISHA: It is.

02:58:13.135 --> 02:58:15.845
SAM: I'll play.
LIAM: <i>Eins, zwei, drei,</i> shoot. What?

02:58:15.845 --> 02:58:18.132
MARISHA: Oh shit. Sorry.
TRAVIS: Who throws on four?

02:58:18.132 --> 02:58:20.054
LAURA: You hit on three!
TALIESIN: One, two, three.

02:58:20.054 --> 02:58:21.797
LAURA: One, two, hit.
LIAM: It was the Zemnian.

02:58:21.797 --> 02:58:22.965
(laughter)

02:58:22.965 --> 02:58:24.475
I've always done one, two, three, shoot.

02:58:24.475 --> 02:58:27.325
MATT: We can't even get it right when it's as intended!

02:58:27.325 --> 02:58:28.522
LIAM: Huh?
MATT: Nothing, continue.

02:58:28.522 --> 02:58:30.755
MARISHA: You were counting so slow, it threw off the rhythm.

02:58:30.755 --> 02:58:33.225
Is it-- so okay, are we going on four, or we going on three?

02:58:33.225 --> 02:58:34.701
LIAM: Whatever you do, I'll do.

02:58:34.701 --> 02:58:36.085
MARISHA: What's the Zemnian way?

02:58:36.085 --> 02:58:37.701

02:59:18.007 --> 02:59:20.565
Yes!

26.

02:59:21.695 --> 02:59:22.528
MATT: 26. All right.

02:59:22.528 --> 02:59:24.835
Glancing about, you don't see any traps.

02:59:24.835 --> 02:59:28.755
You do see the relatively dangerous nature

02:59:28.755 --> 02:59:30.462
of the platforms that you are descending on.

02:59:30.462 --> 02:59:35.375
A lot of the wood here has been weathered,

02:59:36.375 --> 02:59:38.595
and you can see the platform isn't continuous.

02:59:38.595 --> 02:59:42.015
It'll continue and spiral down with some heavy steps,

02:59:42.015 --> 02:59:43.395
some steep steps,

02:59:43.395 --> 02:59:45.125
and then the platform will just stop.

02:59:45.125 --> 02:59:47.075
There is a rope that drops down about 30 feet.

02:59:47.075 --> 02:59:49.605
Then there is the next platform that switches back.

02:59:49.605 --> 02:59:52.635
And every single platform you reach,

02:59:52.635 --> 02:59:54.651
the minute it takes any weight you hear that

02:59:54.651 --> 02:59:57.395
(wood creaking).

02:59:57.395 --> 02:59:59.016

03:00:05.475 --> 03:00:06.745
SAM: Okay.

03:00:06.745 --> 03:00:08.785
MATT: So you all continue to follow suit,

03:00:08.785 --> 03:00:10.100
carefully making your way.

03:00:10.100 --> 03:00:12.825
TRAVIS: Just paying attention to the sound.

03:00:12.825 --> 03:00:14.852
Should we get out a length of rope

03:00:14.852 --> 03:00:16.535
and just hold onto that shit?

03:00:16.535 --> 03:00:17.625
MARISHA: Yeah, might not be a bad idea.

03:00:17.625 --> 03:00:18.555
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a good idea.

03:00:18.555 --> 03:00:20.928
LIAM: Wait, all of us hold the same rope?

03:00:20.928 --> 03:00:22.475
So if one person falls down,

03:00:22.475 --> 03:00:23.741
they pull everyone else with them?

03:00:23.741 --> 03:00:25.281
SAM: No, everyone else catches that person.

03:00:25.281 --> 03:00:27.885
MARISHA: Well, the weight distribution is hopefully

03:00:27.885 --> 03:00:31.225
in the favor of the group and not the one person falling.

03:00:31.225 --> 03:00:33.735
Not that I'm a physicist.
LIAM: I see that as a charm bracelet

03:00:33.735 --> 03:00:36.285
going, (mouth shucking) off the side.

03:00:36.285 --> 03:00:38.172

MARISHA: Well.

03:00:38.172 --> 03:00:40.395

I will turn into a bat.

03:00:40.395 --> 03:00:41.909

MARISHA: Rope. Yeah.
TRAVIS: Rope.

03:00:59.423 --> 03:01:01.392
TALIESIN: I do it. We're just holding on to it, so.

03:01:01.392 --> 03:01:02.383
TRAVIS: 50 feet of rope.

03:01:02.383 --> 03:01:03.755
Everybody wrap it around your wrist,

03:01:03.755 --> 03:01:06.034
grab it, then pass it to the person in front of you.

100 feet down.

03:01:20.045 --> 03:01:23.885
The daylight fades

03:01:23.885 --> 03:01:28.115
as shadow begins to take the path downward.

03:01:28.115 --> 03:01:30.575
You, thankfully, with the goggles you borrowed from Beau,

03:01:30.575 --> 03:01:33.985
keep an eye, but eventually you're going to need

03:01:33.985 --> 03:01:35.465
an additional light source,

03:01:35.465 --> 03:01:38.165
as no sunlight is making its way through.

03:01:38.165 --> 03:01:41.182
TALIESIN: Both.
LIAM: Well, I can do the globules, yeah.

03:01:41.182 --> 03:01:42.715

LIAM: They're already dim, though.

03:01:46.650 --> 03:01:47.483
MATT: You got it.

03:01:49.535 --> 03:01:54.045
Continuing down, you notice as the platform begins

03:01:54.045 --> 03:01:58.825
to shift to the left, the pit begins to angle slightly,

03:01:58.825 --> 03:02:01.765
almost like the slope begins to form.

03:02:01.765 --> 03:02:05.625
And immediately you can see there is a sheet of ice

03:02:05.625 --> 03:02:07.755
that has gathered, making it extremely slick.

03:02:07.755 --> 03:02:11.255
However, the last length of rope on that final platform

03:02:11.255 --> 03:02:13.085
before reaching this section,

03:02:13.085 --> 03:02:16.265
continues down and you could rappel carefully down

03:02:16.265 --> 03:02:17.981
the side of the ice, if you'd like.

03:02:17.981 --> 03:02:18.939

wall walking shit.

03:02:59.547 --> 03:03:02.445

03:03:02.445 --> 03:03:05.012
the edge of the slope,

03:03:05.012 --> 03:03:09.505
it only goes for about 15, 20 feet before it then continues

03:03:09.505 --> 03:03:13.495
into another drop into black nothingness below.

03:03:13.495 --> 03:03:18.115
And about 15 feet below the rotation into a solid pit

03:03:18.115 --> 03:03:20.788
once more, the walls give way.

03:03:22.795 --> 03:03:25.415
So suddenly you are just lowering yourself

03:03:25.415 --> 03:03:26.695
into a black abyss.

03:03:26.695 --> 03:03:27.545

03:03:27.545 --> 03:03:28.945

03:03:31.215 --> 03:03:33.785
Caleb, partway into the rappelling,

03:03:33.785 --> 03:03:35.175
your feet, (whooshing)

03:03:35.175 --> 03:03:36.435
go out from under you,

03:03:36.435 --> 03:03:38.085
as you try and reach for the rope,

03:03:38.085 --> 03:03:41.285
your other foot kicks the rope out from the side

03:03:41.285 --> 03:03:43.454
as that way you fall and you're on your back upside down,

03:03:43.454 --> 03:03:46.785
(screeching) sliding down the ice.

03:03:46.785 --> 03:03:48.965
LAURA: Is he sliding past all of us, since he was last?

03:03:48.965 --> 03:03:49.798
MATT: He would be, yes.

03:03:49.798 --> 03:03:51.645
LAURA: So can we try to catch him on the way?

03:03:51.645 --> 03:03:54.132
MATT: The next person from there would be Beauregard.

03:03:54.132 --> 03:03:56.055
Beau, go ahead and make--

03:03:56.055 --> 03:03:57.847
TRAVIS: Let's go, DMS.

03:03:57.847 --> 03:03:59.095
MATT: I will say go ah--
SAM: Catch that missile.

03:03:59.095 --> 03:04:01.985

03:04:01.985 --> 03:04:06.678
MARISHA: I will say, grabbing things, strength-- wait.

03:04:08.715 --> 03:04:11.665

03:04:11.665 --> 03:04:12.828
MATT: I will say no.

03:04:12.828 --> 03:04:14.455

03:04:14.455 --> 03:04:16.025

03:04:16.858 --> 03:04:17.799
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

03:04:17.799 --> 03:04:19.215
MATT: It wasn't terribly challenging,

03:04:19.215 --> 03:04:21.515
but because the arrangement and he was the last one,

03:04:21.515 --> 03:04:22.935
thankfully, that did work in your favor.

03:04:22.935 --> 03:04:25.845
So as he streaks by, you're just now cresting over the edge

03:04:25.845 --> 03:04:28.245
and you see him, (screeching) scrape past.

03:04:28.245 --> 03:04:31.461
You reach out, grab him, and the rope lurches for a second,

03:04:31.461 --> 03:04:34.287
just from the physicality of everything.
MARISHA: Ugh, my shoulder!

03:04:34.287 --> 03:04:36.365
MATT: You all hear that as (groans),

03:04:36.365 --> 03:04:38.025
Beau groans with her shoulder being pulled

03:04:38.025 --> 03:04:39.935
ever so faintly out of the socket

03:04:39.935 --> 03:04:41.568
before she, (pops) pulls it back in.

03:04:41.568 --> 03:04:42.901
MARISHA: Gah.
LIAM: <i>Mein Gott!</i>

03:04:42.901 --> 03:04:44.768
MATT: You are caught.

03:04:44.768 --> 03:04:46.145
You all below are dangling now.

03:04:46.145 --> 03:04:47.837
Any sort of movement at the top of the rope

03:04:47.837 --> 03:04:50.198
just sends further waves down to the rest of you

03:04:50.198 --> 03:04:52.115
who are just free dangling.

03:04:52.115 --> 03:04:52.948
ASHLEY: What's going on?

03:04:52.948 --> 03:04:55.497
MARISHA: Sorry!

03:04:55.497 --> 03:04:57.026
TRAVIS: Beau, Beau. Are you holding--?

03:04:57.026 --> 03:04:58.649
Yeah, I climb back up a little bit.

03:04:58.649 --> 03:05:01.135
MARISHA: Grab, like-- boost his ass or something.

03:05:01.135 --> 03:05:02.755
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll actually grab his shins

03:05:02.755 --> 03:05:04.845
with my arm and push him back over to the rope.

03:05:04.845 --> 03:05:06.112
You have it? Do you have it?

03:05:06.112 --> 03:05:09.489
MATT: It takes a moment,
but you do manage to readjust yourself

03:05:09.489 --> 03:05:10.984
and get back a hold of the rope.

03:05:10.984 --> 03:05:14.137
LIAM: Your physical prowess
has saved my magic for another day.

03:05:14.137 --> 03:05:17.740
MARISHA: Oh, fuck, I think you broke my shoulder.

03:05:17.740 --> 03:05:18.638
Okay.
LIAM: I weigh

03:05:18.638 --> 03:05:20.648
140 pounds.

03:05:20.648 --> 03:05:22.617
MARISHA: Oof.
TRAVIS: That's a lot.

03:05:22.617 --> 03:05:25.039
MATT: So Veth, do you keep descending the rope?

03:05:25.039 --> 03:05:27.175
SAM: I'm descending the rope.

03:05:27.175 --> 03:05:29.565
MATT: As you begin to lower down into the dark expanse,

03:05:29.565 --> 03:05:32.615
you can look up at the roof where the pit was

03:05:32.615 --> 03:05:35.405
and you could see that's a hole in a ceiling.

03:05:35.405 --> 03:05:39.805
The ceiling is an odd, pyramid-like apex

03:05:39.805 --> 03:05:41.255
from what little bit of light there is.

03:05:41.255 --> 03:05:45.065
But it's a gradual separation that then goes into darkness.

03:05:45.065 --> 03:05:46.235
You cannot see the walls.

03:05:46.235 --> 03:05:47.355
You cannot see where it ends,

03:05:47.355 --> 03:05:49.935
but you are at, not the direct apex,

03:05:49.935 --> 03:05:52.085
but some element near the top of this angled, vaulted roof.

03:05:52.085 --> 03:05:56.426
but some element near the top of this angled, vaulted roof.

03:05:57.515 --> 03:05:59.795
You continue to lower down,

03:05:59.795 --> 03:06:04.755
lower down, looking for any sign of floor or end to this.

03:06:04.755 --> 03:06:06.535
But because the light sources are above you,

03:06:06.535 --> 03:06:09.235
you're having to rely upon the catching up

03:06:09.235 --> 03:06:12.185
of Caduceus and Caleb.

03:06:12.185 --> 03:06:13.865
Even with your darkvision goggles,

03:06:13.865 --> 03:06:18.865
you don't have the most extreme vision.

03:06:19.575 --> 03:06:20.645
Eventually, you glance down

03:06:20.645 --> 03:06:22.935
because it gives you 60 feet, right?

03:06:22.935 --> 03:06:23.997
Or is it 50, 30 feet.

03:06:23.997 --> 03:06:25.255
MARISHA: Goggles? 60 feet.

03:06:25.255 --> 03:06:27.035
MATT: 60 feet?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:06:27.035 --> 03:06:29.485
MATT: You do begin to see the
floor begin to approach finally,

03:06:29.485 --> 03:06:32.635
and it brings a sense of relief to you.

03:06:32.635 --> 03:06:34.205
Glancing below,

03:06:34.205 --> 03:06:36.725
you can already see that there's

03:06:38.125 --> 03:06:41.115
a tangled spread of broken shale

03:06:41.115 --> 03:06:44.680
and small patches of snow, all across the floor below you.

03:06:45.945 --> 03:06:49.845
It is a broken mess of a floor,

03:06:49.845 --> 03:06:52.425
but it looks safe to land.

03:06:52.425 --> 03:06:53.695
And the rope that you're on does

03:06:53.695 --> 03:06:55.105
eventually come and curl up at the bottom

03:06:55.105 --> 03:06:58.708
with an additional 40 to 50 feet of slack.

03:07:01.375 --> 03:07:03.995
You lower down, you touch,

03:07:03.995 --> 03:07:06.305
and look up as each of you carefully one by one,

03:07:06.305 --> 03:07:08.135
descend to the bottom of this chamber.

03:07:08.135 --> 03:07:12.665
Looking up, you can just barely see the faint bit of light

03:07:12.665 --> 03:07:14.575
that, by comparison to this dark interior,

03:07:14.575 --> 03:07:17.655
you can see just the faintest essence

03:07:17.655 --> 03:07:21.045
of reflected daylight that just barely outlines

03:07:21.045 --> 03:07:24.805
the very tiniest sliver of an eclipse,

03:07:24.805 --> 03:07:27.268
where you first arrived.

03:07:28.535 --> 03:07:31.195
As you look around you, you can see

03:07:31.195 --> 03:07:33.465
remnants of tools, some pick axes.

03:07:33.465 --> 03:07:37.355
You can see a couple of empty discarded oil lanterns.

03:07:37.355 --> 03:07:42.130
You can see a bedroll that's been placed at the side.

03:07:42.130 --> 03:07:44.575
This looks like a camping location

03:07:44.575 --> 03:07:47.688
for excavation crews that have come through.

03:07:49.875 --> 03:07:50.865
But seems most everything,

03:07:50.865 --> 03:07:52.005
at least in the immediate vicinity,

03:07:52.005 --> 03:07:55.495
has been picked clean or destroyed.

03:07:57.225 --> 03:08:01.898
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object.

03:08:01.898 --> 03:08:02.814
MATT: Okay.

03:08:02.814 --> 03:08:06.739
LAURA: And I'm going to try to find a threshold crest.

03:08:06.739 --> 03:08:08.165
MARISHA: (fingers snapping)

03:08:08.165 --> 03:08:08.998
MATT: Okay.

03:08:11.075 --> 03:08:13.665
It doesn't quite click in yet,

03:08:13.665 --> 03:08:16.165
but there is a duration on that, correct?

03:08:16.165 --> 03:08:17.012
LAURA: 10 minutes.
MATT: 10 minutes?

03:08:17.012 --> 03:08:18.770
Okay, good to know.

03:08:18.770 --> 03:08:20.935
Right as you finish that, you hear a voice ring out

03:08:20.935 --> 03:08:23.045
from the shadow around you.

03:08:23.045 --> 03:08:24.602
"Halt!

03:08:24.602 --> 03:08:26.823
"You are surrounded.

03:08:26.823 --> 03:08:30.425
"Identify your purpose and allegiance,

03:08:30.425 --> 03:08:32.498
"or be shot down where you stand!"

03:08:33.905 --> 03:08:37.395
MARISHA: Do we have any idea or indication of accent?

03:08:37.395 --> 03:08:38.228
LIAM: Yeah.

03:08:40.535 --> 03:08:42.956
MATT: You would gather.
SAM: That was Italian.

03:08:42.956 --> 03:08:43.972
MARISHA: Tony?!

03:08:43.972 --> 03:08:46.272
Holy shit! Dude!
MATT: "It's been so long."

03:08:46.272 --> 03:08:47.889
MARISHA: What are you doing here?

03:08:47.889 --> 03:08:48.789
It's been 10 years.

03:08:48.789 --> 03:08:53.655
MATT: You've heard-- elements of it seem to be Empire-ish.

03:08:53.655 --> 03:08:56.785
Some regions around Hupperdook seem to lean

03:08:56.785 --> 03:09:00.175
into this variation within the Zemnian region.

03:09:00.175 --> 03:09:04.428
So it does seem to have an element of Empire root.

03:09:06.935 --> 03:09:11.935
LIAM: We are of the Empire from outside of Rexxentrum.

03:09:12.375 --> 03:09:16.755
Although we travel far afield, on official business.

03:09:16.755 --> 03:09:17.968
MATT: "Under whose watch?"

03:09:20.965 --> 03:09:24.325
LIAM: We've been sent here by Lady DeRogna,

03:09:24.325 --> 03:09:26.408
of the Cerberus Assembly.

03:09:28.045 --> 03:09:28.945
MATT: There's a pause.

03:09:30.485 --> 03:09:31.756
"All right, hold on."

03:09:31.756 --> 03:09:34.195
(laughter)

03:09:34.195 --> 03:09:37.535
Hear some shuffling, and carefully stepping into the light,

03:09:37.535 --> 03:09:42.535
you see this tiny, middle-aged, gnome man, by himself,

03:09:42.575 --> 03:09:46.355
his hair is tattered up and tangled,

03:09:46.355 --> 03:09:49.846
a dark brown color, gray towards the edges of his temples,

03:09:49.846 --> 03:09:50.975
salt and pepper.

03:09:50.975 --> 03:09:53.240
He has a chin beard that looks like it's just

03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:55.425
been left to grow and curl on itself,

03:09:55.425 --> 03:09:57.255
where it gives this fuzzy chin strap.

03:09:57.255 --> 03:09:58.388
It's big and thick.

03:09:59.245 --> 03:10:01.285
He looks like he's suffered a little bit of frostbite,

03:10:01.285 --> 03:10:03.065
maybe at the tip of his nose at some point in his age,

03:10:03.065 --> 03:10:05.395
and it's just a little dark and nubbed at the edge

03:10:05.395 --> 03:10:07.065
but he looks up at you all with thick furs

03:10:07.065 --> 03:10:08.165
and equipment on his back.

03:10:08.165 --> 03:10:08.998
And he goes,

03:10:10.392 --> 03:10:11.225
"All right.

03:10:12.775 --> 03:10:14.416
"I'm Iver."

03:10:15.319 --> 03:10:16.152
SAM: Iva?

03:10:16.152 --> 03:10:19.143
MATT: "Iver Climtaver.

03:10:19.143 --> 03:10:22.559
"I am actually here under

03:10:22.559 --> 03:10:24.276
"Zana Deelio,

03:10:24.276 --> 03:10:27.436
"the apprentice to the Ludinus Da'leth.

03:10:28.415 --> 03:10:30.681
"Have you been sent as a backup, as the requested backup?"

03:10:30.681 --> 03:10:34.322
"Have you been sent as a backup, as the requested backup?"

03:10:35.525 --> 03:10:36.358
TALIESIN: Ooh.

03:10:37.316 --> 03:10:39.515
LIAM: From the Martinet, you mean?

03:10:39.515 --> 03:10:42.085
MATT: "Well, I sent out a request.

03:10:42.085 --> 03:10:46.065
"The initial party of which I was the lookout for

03:10:46.065 --> 03:10:47.375
"has not returned in days.

03:10:47.375 --> 03:10:49.305
"So I was requesting for backup."

03:10:49.305 --> 03:10:52.015
LIAM: Yeah, well, Lady DeRogna has arranged

03:10:52.015 --> 03:10:54.465
for us to be here in the frozen north.

03:10:54.465 --> 03:10:56.102
MATT: "Oh. Thank goodness. Thank goodness.

03:10:56.102 --> 03:10:57.775
"So very happy. Glad you could come."

03:10:57.775 --> 03:10:59.171
LAURA: (sneezing)
MATT: "<i>Gesundheit.</i>"

03:10:59.171 --> 03:11:00.767
LAURA: Thank you. It's very cold down here.

03:11:00.767 --> 03:11:02.805
MATT: "It is, <i>ja.</i>

03:11:02.805 --> 03:11:05.525
"I've not heard from Zana or the rest of our troop,

03:11:05.525 --> 03:11:09.725
"and I'm starting to go a little scared, a little crazy."

03:11:09.725 --> 03:11:11.155
LIAM: Yeah. It seems to be going around.

03:11:11.155 --> 03:11:13.015
We are out of touch with our--

03:11:14.365 --> 03:11:16.905
MATT: "Did you bring additional food, perhaps?

03:11:16.905 --> 03:11:18.685
"I'm running a little low on supplies."

03:11:18.685 --> 03:11:21.595
SAM: Where are the others who had us surrounded?

03:11:21.595 --> 03:11:22.984
MATT: "Oh, it's just me, I--"

03:11:22.984 --> 03:11:24.298
SAM: Ohh. Oh.

03:11:24.298 --> 03:11:27.655
LIAM: Yeah. Let me, I have some provisions here.

03:11:28.605 --> 03:11:29.888
These are called boba.

03:11:30.725 --> 03:11:32.704
MATT: He grabs them, he's like--

03:11:32.704 --> 03:11:33.755
TALIESIN: Gentle.
LAURA: Just one.

03:11:33.755 --> 03:11:35.695
LIAM: Just one a day.

03:11:35.695 --> 03:11:36.945
I know they look small.

03:11:36.945 --> 03:11:39.952
You will regret if you have even two.

03:11:39.952 --> 03:11:43.708
It will fill your colon like all stone.

03:11:43.708 --> 03:11:46.815
MATT: "Oh, I find extreme importance in colon health.

03:11:46.815 --> 03:11:48.134
"So I appreciate you letting me know."

03:11:48.134 --> 03:11:49.457
(laughter)

03:11:49.457 --> 03:11:50.757
TALIESIN: Clearly.
LIAM: Okay.

03:11:51.785 --> 03:11:54.009
MATT: He wraps it in a handkerchief and puts it in a pocket.

03:11:54.009 --> 03:11:56.355
(wet clicking)

03:11:56.355 --> 03:11:58.422
LIAM: How long have you been here, friend?

03:11:58.422 --> 03:12:01.825
MATT: "I've been here about a week and a half, I think.

03:12:01.825 --> 03:12:03.965
"I don't know. Time is a bit strange in these caverns.

03:12:03.965 --> 03:12:05.415
"There's not a lot of light.

03:12:05.415 --> 03:12:08.575
"It could be fast-- longer, shorter, I don't know.

03:12:08.575 --> 03:12:11.005
"What day is it? Where-- um."

03:12:11.005 --> 03:12:12.735
LAURA: Have you seen a big gem

03:12:12.735 --> 03:12:16.065
about this big, maybe smaller, maybe bigger?

03:12:16.065 --> 03:12:19.865
MATT: "No, I've mainly just stayed in this area.

03:12:19.865 --> 03:12:24.865
"I did wander a little bit into the northeastern region,

03:12:25.443 --> 03:12:29.140
"but then I heard some very terrible noises

03:12:29.140 --> 03:12:30.388
"from one of the other regions,

03:12:30.388 --> 03:12:32.255
"so I just came back in here and hid."

03:12:32.255 --> 03:12:33.815
MARISHA: And what happened?

03:12:33.815 --> 03:12:35.165
Where's the rest of your team?

03:12:35.165 --> 03:12:35.998
MATT: "I don't know.

03:12:35.998 --> 03:12:37.525
"They've been excavating in and out and

03:12:37.525 --> 03:12:42.085
"gathering information and findings,

03:12:42.085 --> 03:12:44.565
"but they just have not returned in some time."

03:12:44.565 --> 03:12:46.745
LIAM: How many were in your party?

03:12:46.745 --> 03:12:48.205
MATT: "Originally, it was--

03:12:48.205 --> 03:12:50.853
"it would have been six, including myself,

03:12:51.975 --> 03:12:53.995
"but now I do not know where they are.

03:12:53.995 --> 03:12:57.055
"They might be lost, they might be abandoned, or worse."

03:12:57.055 --> 03:12:58.345
SAM: We can try our best to find them.

03:12:58.345 --> 03:13:00.895
It would help us to know, you know,

03:13:00.895 --> 03:13:03.805
which pathway they took last,

03:13:03.805 --> 03:13:08.805
but also if your mission was similar to ours.

03:13:09.421 --> 03:13:12.735
The Ludinus-- Ludinus sent you?

03:13:12.735 --> 03:13:15.855
MATT: "Well, I was brought here by Zana.

03:13:15.855 --> 03:13:18.496
"She apprentices under Ludinus,

03:13:18.496 --> 03:13:22.755
"but, you know, it was--

03:13:22.755 --> 03:13:24.625
"You work with the Assembly.

"It's fine.

03:13:25.755 --> 03:13:30.700
"We are one of the cycling crews,
expedition crews, delvers."

03:13:30.700 --> 03:13:31.533
"We are one of the cycling crews,
expedition crews, delvers."

03:13:33.405 --> 03:13:35.610
TALIESIN: I feel like we skipped over something. Hold on.

03:13:35.610 --> 03:13:37.788
Weird noises? Elaborate.

03:13:39.314 --> 03:13:40.947
MATT: "Hoh, um.

03:13:42.295 --> 03:13:43.670
"Sounds like a--

03:13:46.085 --> 03:13:48.265
"You ever heard like a baby crying?"

03:13:48.265 --> 03:13:49.491
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:13:49.491 --> 03:13:52.190
MATT: "But, like, deeper."

03:13:53.105 --> 03:13:54.145
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:13:54.145 --> 03:13:55.025
MATT: "Like that."

03:13:55.025 --> 03:13:56.205
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:13:56.205 --> 03:13:57.989
MARISHA: Deeper.
TALIESIN: Well, that's odd.

03:13:57.989 --> 03:13:58.872
MATT: "<i>Ja.</i>."

03:13:58.872 --> 03:14:00.845
TALIESIN: It was like a scary big baby or just

03:14:00.845 --> 03:14:03.235
"Oh, that would be really cute if I were larger," big baby?

03:14:03.235 --> 03:14:05.353
MATT: "I don't know if cute is the word that I would use."

03:14:05.353 --> 03:14:08.524
ASHLEY: Wouldn't that just sound like an adult crying?

03:14:08.524 --> 03:14:10.365
(laughter)

03:14:10.365 --> 03:14:12.084
MATT: "You'll know what I mean when you hear it."

03:14:12.084 --> 03:14:16.105
(laughter)

03:14:16.105 --> 03:14:21.095
ASHLEY: Just asking, you know, just is, an adult baby.

03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:25.765
TALIESIN: I mean, you have a fair point there.

03:14:25.765 --> 03:14:28.185
SAM: And again, though, just general excavation

03:14:28.185 --> 03:14:31.265
or were you looking for something specific?

03:14:31.265 --> 03:14:34.212
MATT: "Well, I wasn't given more instructions

03:14:34.212 --> 03:14:35.203
"than was necessary.

03:14:35.203 --> 03:14:39.115
"I was just brought along to keep watch and, you know,

03:14:39.115 --> 03:14:42.028
"maintain the base camp here."

03:14:43.135 --> 03:14:44.485
SAM: Great. Great.

03:14:44.485 --> 03:14:46.645
MARISHA: When were you expecting them to return?

03:14:46.645 --> 03:14:51.605
MATT: "Initially, it was only
supposed to be a four day delve.

03:14:51.605 --> 03:14:53.225
"This was the supplies they had for it.

03:14:53.225 --> 03:14:56.635
"So I ran out in that allocated time,

03:14:56.635 --> 03:14:59.168
"and then had to get creative."

03:14:59.168 --> 03:15:01.848
MARISHA: And how did you request back up?

03:15:02.715 --> 03:15:04.965
MATT: "Oh, well, I didn't request it,

03:15:04.965 --> 03:15:06.405
"but whenever things go wrong

03:15:06.405 --> 03:15:07.715
"there is a request for backup.

03:15:07.715 --> 03:15:11.575
"And I assumed that the individuals who went ahead

03:15:11.575 --> 03:15:14.125
"of me had requested, with your arrival. So."

03:15:14.125 --> 03:15:17.125
LIAM: There is a great deal
of trouble in multiple areas here.

03:15:17.125 --> 03:15:20.125
In fact, I don't want to alarm you,

03:15:20.125 --> 03:15:22.785
but in addition to the dangers within,

03:15:22.785 --> 03:15:24.805
there are dangers without, as well.

03:15:24.805 --> 03:15:28.345
And we are worried that people who have goals

03:15:28.345 --> 03:15:30.261
contrary to those of the Empire

03:15:30.261 --> 03:15:32.275
are converging on this place as well.

03:15:32.275 --> 03:15:34.535
So if you are to remain,

03:15:34.535 --> 03:15:36.385
we must find a way for you to keep hidden.

03:15:36.385 --> 03:15:40.425
And I do not recommend risking your skin

03:15:40.425 --> 03:15:42.665
like you just did with us.

03:15:42.665 --> 03:15:44.474
MATT: "Right."
LIAM: If we are followed in--

03:15:44.474 --> 03:15:48.062
MATT: "I can remain hidden quite well.

03:15:48.062 --> 03:15:49.645
"Well, now that I know your voice prints,

03:15:49.645 --> 03:15:51.975
"it should be easy enough for you to call me when it's safe.

03:15:51.975 --> 03:15:53.765
"I can just stay out of sight, especially now

03:15:53.765 --> 03:15:58.375
"that I have these strange little colon balls

03:15:58.375 --> 03:15:59.955
"that you gave me."
LIAM: Yes.

03:15:59.955 --> 03:16:02.495
TRAVIS: Aside from the noises,
you said, "when things went wrong."

03:16:02.495 --> 03:16:03.588
What else went wrong?

03:16:05.175 --> 03:16:06.008
MATT: "Well.

03:16:08.496 --> 03:16:09.329
"As far as I know,

03:16:09.329 --> 03:16:12.025
"in part of the challenge of excavations like this,

03:16:12.025 --> 03:16:17.025
"is there are still arcane devices and entrapments,

03:16:17.275 --> 03:16:21.065
"and protections that are active even after all this time.

03:16:21.065 --> 03:16:24.740
"So there must be care taken when excavating.

03:16:25.705 --> 03:16:27.375
"There was a device,

03:16:27.375 --> 03:16:31.451
"shortly into our arrival, that was stumbled upon,

03:16:31.451 --> 03:16:36.451
"that sent a great bit of pain through me and my troop,

03:16:36.735 --> 03:16:41.590
"but we survived, and they continued on after some rest.

03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:45.655
"And I decided, once again, to just not go anywhere else."

03:16:45.655 --> 03:16:47.105
TRAVIS: And is that further within?

03:16:48.105 --> 03:16:50.565
MATT: "Oh, that originally occurred in that chamber,"

03:16:50.565 --> 03:16:52.125
he points to the northeast, he goes,

03:16:52.125 --> 03:16:54.765
"But there are two other chambers.

03:16:54.765 --> 03:16:58.215
"They were last seen going the westward chamber,"

03:16:58.215 --> 03:17:00.818
and he points in the western direction.

03:17:01.785 --> 03:17:06.545
"The southeastern, I have not been to."

03:17:06.545 --> 03:17:08.835
LAURA: Can I go up to the edge of each one of those

03:17:08.835 --> 03:17:11.690
and feel, see if I get a little ping?

03:17:12.775 --> 03:17:14.241
MATT: Going up to the edge of each,

03:17:14.241 --> 03:17:15.695
you do not get a ping yet.

03:17:15.695 --> 03:17:16.828
LAURA: Fuck.

03:17:16.828 --> 03:17:19.845
TRAVIS: And it's northeast, north, and...?

03:17:19.845 --> 03:17:21.741
MATT: Northeast, southeast, and west.

03:17:23.665 --> 03:17:27.655
LIAM: Zana, that you mentioned is-- she?

03:17:27.655 --> 03:17:28.638
MATT: "Zana is a she, yes."

03:17:28.638 --> 03:17:29.918
LIAM: Is she an annex?

03:17:30.965 --> 03:17:33.340
MATT: "Yeah, I think annex is the word.

03:17:34.565 --> 03:17:38.697
"I am not of the Assembly, but they do hire me

03:17:38.697 --> 03:17:42.785
"on occasion to assist when coming through."

03:17:42.785 --> 03:17:44.235
LIAM: Of course. We are the same.

03:17:46.095 --> 03:17:48.575
LAURA: I'm going to try for Divine Intervention right now.

03:17:48.575 --> 03:17:50.405
LIAM: Ooh. Get it, girl.
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

03:17:50.405 --> 03:17:52.283
What are you wanting to divine?

03:17:52.283 --> 03:17:54.426
Or intervene?
LAURA: I want the Traveler--

03:17:56.674 --> 03:17:58.375
I'm going to say:

03:17:58.375 --> 03:17:59.828
Can you help us?

03:18:01.075 --> 03:18:04.048
Can you help us get what the Tomb Takers are after?

03:18:05.335 --> 03:18:07.202
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll.

03:18:07.202 --> 03:18:09.085
LIAM: Come on, you shifty fuck.
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:18:10.345 --> 03:18:12.585
LAURA: No. Fuck.
LIAM: Too shifty.

03:18:12.585 --> 03:18:13.705
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.

03:18:13.705 --> 03:18:15.240
MATT: He leans in your ear and goes,

03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:18.905
"I would, if I really had any more idea than you do

03:18:18.905 --> 03:18:20.245
"but I'll keep an eye out."

03:18:20.245 --> 03:18:21.565
LAURA: Yeah. Okay.

03:18:21.565 --> 03:18:23.815
TALIESIN: I think I'll do the same, see what happens.

03:18:27.395 --> 03:18:28.625
MARISHA: Whose god is better?

03:18:28.625 --> 03:18:30.137
TALIESIN: No.

03:18:30.137 --> 03:18:31.353
LAURA: ♪ Neither! ♪

03:18:31.353 --> 03:18:33.842
MATT: The Traveler leans back in your ear and goes,

03:18:33.842 --> 03:18:35.465
"Like he thought she could do any better."

03:18:35.465 --> 03:18:37.073
LAURA: I know, right?
LIAM: I like how he--

03:18:37.073 --> 03:18:38.431
TALIESIN: Hey!

03:18:38.431 --> 03:18:40.190
MATT: "What?"
TALIESIN: Come on.

03:18:40.190 --> 03:18:41.031
MATT: I'm just saying,

03:18:41.031 --> 03:18:44.135
it's seems bit uncouth to just immediately pray upon her

03:18:44.135 --> 03:18:45.485
and my capabilities and go,

03:18:45.485 --> 03:18:47.615
"Well, I'm certain that mine can."
TALIESIN: Oh, if you would've taken care of it,

03:18:47.615 --> 03:18:48.765
I wouldn't have made a point of it.

03:18:48.765 --> 03:18:51.145
LAURA: Oh, that's true.
MATT: "Oh, well. Fine."

03:18:51.145 --> 03:18:53.903
The gnome is like--
"Um!

03:18:53.903 --> 03:18:55.435
"Is this also in the Assembly?"

03:18:55.435 --> 03:18:56.339
TALIESIN: It's very normal.

03:18:56.339 --> 03:18:57.839
LAURA: Yes. Yes. He's very powerful.

03:18:57.839 --> 03:18:59.425
MATT: (as the Traveler)
"Don't worry about it. (blows)"

03:18:59.425 --> 03:19:00.983
Blows in his face, his eyes blink

03:19:00.983 --> 03:19:02.505
and the Traveler vanishes.

03:19:03.585 --> 03:19:07.487
(as Iver) "Anyway, there is--

03:19:09.605 --> 03:19:11.245
"I'm going to hide. (chuckles nervously)

03:19:11.245 --> 03:19:14.245
"Just call me if you need anything or if there's danger

03:19:14.245 --> 03:19:18.585
"or you found them, or you're running, or you're dying.

03:19:18.585 --> 03:19:21.355
"Just let me know if something's happening."

03:19:21.355 --> 03:19:23.711
TRAVIS: Of course. Likewise,
if you see anyone else entering the chamber,

03:19:23.711 --> 03:19:28.175
use that sturdy intimidating voice of yours, eh?

03:19:28.175 --> 03:19:29.208
LAURA: No, don't. Don't.

03:19:29.208 --> 03:19:31.135
If you see people entering the chamber, just hide,

03:19:31.135 --> 03:19:32.755
because they will kill you.

03:19:32.755 --> 03:19:34.445
MATT: "Who do I, which one, what should I do?

03:19:34.445 --> 03:19:36.465
"There's both two-- they have conflicting."

03:19:36.465 --> 03:19:38.935
LIAM: That's two for hide and one for confront.

03:19:38.935 --> 03:19:40.813
MATT: "Ah, sorry, hide wins."

03:19:40.813 --> 03:19:42.705
SAM: You know what, though?

03:19:42.705 --> 03:19:45.975
As you hide-- and I'll just pick up some tools

03:19:45.975 --> 03:19:47.055
off the ground.

03:19:47.055 --> 03:19:51.893
Here, take these two, you know, tips of axes or whatever,

03:19:51.893 --> 03:19:54.405
if you're discovered, bang them together

03:19:54.405 --> 03:19:56.105
and then it'll send a sound

03:19:56.105 --> 03:19:57.055
and then maybe we'll hear

03:19:57.055 --> 03:19:58.160
and we'll come back and save you.

03:19:58.160 --> 03:20:00.502
MATT: "Right. Scare off things with big noise."

03:20:00.502 --> 03:20:01.905
SAM: Sure. Sure. Sure.

03:20:01.905 --> 03:20:04.705
MATT: "It works to get the raccoons
out of my home growing up."

03:20:04.705 --> 03:20:05.612
SAM: Same thing. Yes.

03:20:05.612 --> 03:20:07.945
MATT: "All right. I'll hide and prepare."

03:20:07.945 --> 03:20:11.605
TALIESIN: I can Commune, if you think it's a good idea.

03:20:11.605 --> 03:20:12.438
LIAM: Do you?

03:20:14.405 --> 03:20:15.275
SAM: Commune?

03:20:15.275 --> 03:20:16.525
TALIESIN: I mean, I can ask.
LAURA: 10 minutes.

03:20:16.525 --> 03:20:17.535
Do we have time?

03:20:17.535 --> 03:20:19.015
Oh, wait, no.

03:20:19.015 --> 03:20:22.165
Don't take it just yet because I have this Locate Object up

03:20:22.165 --> 03:20:24.044
I'm going to lose it.
TALIESIN: Okay. Let's not.

03:20:24.044 --> 03:20:24.925
MARISHA: Yes. Yes. Yes.

03:20:24.925 --> 03:20:27.045
TRAVIS: Northeast, southeast, and west.

03:20:27.045 --> 03:20:28.435
Like a Y.

03:20:28.435 --> 03:20:29.835
Any favorites?

03:20:29.835 --> 03:20:31.328
MARISHA: You didn't get any pings?

03:20:32.885 --> 03:20:34.275
Well, they went west.

03:20:34.275 --> 03:20:35.108
SAM: They went west?

03:20:35.108 --> 03:20:37.085
MARISHA: That's the group last went west.

03:20:37.085 --> 03:20:40.055
LAURA: And the chamber that
you were in, was it a closed chamber

03:20:40.055 --> 03:20:42.708
and you definitely didn't see any big jewels?

03:20:42.708 --> 03:20:44.545
MATT: "I mean, I mainly just stayed here.

03:20:44.545 --> 03:20:46.962
"I briefly stepped into the northeast chamber

03:20:46.962 --> 03:20:51.162
"and I just decided when hearing some of those noises

03:20:51.162 --> 03:20:55.155
"from the other chambers to not go further."
MARISHA: So big baby noises from northeast?

03:20:55.155 --> 03:20:58.595
MATT: "Well, I heard the noises coming from this area.

03:20:58.595 --> 03:20:59.985
"So one of the other chambers,

03:20:59.985 --> 03:21:01.318
"but I began to delve into there

03:21:01.318 --> 03:21:02.612
"and decided not to go any further because I--"

03:21:02.612 --> 03:21:04.453
MARISHA: And your party went west.

03:21:04.453 --> 03:21:05.795
MATT: "Went west, yes."
TRAVIS: And have you messed around

03:21:05.795 --> 03:21:07.412
with the southeastern chamber at all?

03:21:07.412 --> 03:21:10.105
LAURA: No.
MATT: "No. I just stopped going anywhere."

03:21:10.105 --> 03:21:12.535
TALIESIN: I mean.
MATT: "Best to stay put, you know."

03:21:12.535 --> 03:21:14.615
MARISHA: Should we follow them or pick our on path?

03:21:14.615 --> 03:21:17.065
SAM: We should pick three different paths and split up.

03:21:17.065 --> 03:21:19.723
MARISHA: Deal.
MATT: "Good plan."

03:21:19.723 --> 03:21:21.778
SAM: We'll cover more ground that way.

03:21:21.778 --> 03:21:24.356
MATT: (sneezes)
ASHLEY: The one end that you--

03:21:24.356 --> 03:21:26.155
MATT: (sneezes)
TRAVIS: Bless you, bless you.

03:21:26.155 --> 03:21:29.442
ASHLEY: The one path that you looked in,

03:21:29.442 --> 03:21:32.325
and then one with the older baby noises,

03:21:32.325 --> 03:21:37.325
and then the one with the people that disappeared.

03:21:37.355 --> 03:21:39.665
MATT: "I don't know which of the chambers

03:21:39.665 --> 03:21:41.375
"the baby noises were coming from.

03:21:41.375 --> 03:21:45.225
"I didn't hear them until I went into the northeast chamber.

03:21:45.225 --> 03:21:48.225
"So it comes from one or the other two.

03:21:48.225 --> 03:21:51.047
"I just decided not to check."
MARISHA: I mean, we could split up,

03:21:51.047 --> 03:21:53.508
and go just a little bit.

03:21:53.508 --> 03:21:56.687
And then, like, radio to, like, message to one another.

03:21:56.687 --> 03:21:58.358
TRAVIS: Ooh.
LAURA: I don't like it. I don't like it.

03:21:58.358 --> 03:21:59.535
Let's just try for south.

03:21:59.535 --> 03:22:00.735
TRAVIS: Yeah. I think that's true.

03:22:00.735 --> 03:22:03.805
LAURA: We'll get a little bit in. If I get a ping, cool.

03:22:03.805 --> 03:22:06.497
If not, then we will--
MARISHA: Then we'll go back? okay.

03:22:06.497 --> 03:22:09.065
SAM: But why South? That's the one that we--

03:22:09.065 --> 03:22:10.202
TRAVIS: Haven't.
MARISHA: Haven't been.

03:22:10.202 --> 03:22:11.532
LAURA: Whatever. Just pick one.

03:22:11.532 --> 03:22:13.785
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. You do you.

03:22:13.785 --> 03:22:16.605
Wherever you want to go.

03:22:16.605 --> 03:22:17.735
MATT: "All right. I'm going to go hide."

03:22:17.735 --> 03:22:18.666
LAURA: Okay, bye.

03:22:18.666 --> 03:22:20.033
MATT: "Bye," and he runs off into the shadows.

03:22:20.033 --> 03:22:22.415
You hear the footsteps (tapping).

03:22:22.415 --> 03:22:23.248
MARISHA: To the south!

03:22:23.248 --> 03:22:24.147
TALIESIN and LAURA: South.

03:22:24.147 --> 03:22:24.988
SAM: South it is.

03:22:24.988 --> 03:22:27.263
MATT: Southeast. All right.

03:22:29.815 --> 03:22:31.838
Heading in the southeast direction,

03:22:32.685 --> 03:22:37.495
you begin to notice as you open through this archway

03:22:37.495 --> 03:22:39.675
from the chamber you're in,

03:22:39.675 --> 03:22:43.455
what might've been a cobblestone street at one time.

03:22:43.455 --> 03:22:47.355
You can see these beautifully laid roadways ahead of you

03:22:47.355 --> 03:22:49.615
with sidewalks,

03:22:50.625 --> 03:22:53.965
but they're broken and certain regions are pressed upward

03:22:53.965 --> 03:22:55.605
five or six feet.

03:22:55.605 --> 03:22:56.825
Like, you know the end of Ghostbusters

03:22:56.825 --> 03:22:58.905
where the street begins to break up in different levels?

03:22:58.905 --> 03:23:01.815
It's like that multiple places across here.

03:23:01.815 --> 03:23:06.815
You can see fallen-over poles where bulbs

03:23:06.865 --> 03:23:09.255
that may have contained once arcane light sources

03:23:09.255 --> 03:23:11.965
have lost their power over time.

03:23:11.965 --> 03:23:14.335
You can see to the left,

03:23:14.335 --> 03:23:16.615
and as you glance up as the light emerges

03:23:16.615 --> 03:23:19.055
and you step into the beginning of this chamber,

03:23:19.055 --> 03:23:22.715
there is a massive angled stone slab

03:23:22.715 --> 03:23:25.945
that is currently covering what would have been

03:23:25.945 --> 03:23:28.275
the open sky of this road.

03:23:28.275 --> 03:23:29.835
A portion where the rock had fallen,

03:23:29.835 --> 03:23:32.184
this massive piece of stone that had crushed

03:23:32.184 --> 03:23:33.415
the left-hand side.

03:23:33.415 --> 03:23:35.975
So eventually, it comes to a finite wedge

03:23:35.975 --> 03:23:37.305
and you cannot see what's crushed

03:23:37.305 --> 03:23:39.445
beneath that side of the ceiling.

03:23:39.445 --> 03:23:43.375
To the right, you can see numerous buildings.

03:23:43.375 --> 03:23:45.335
Some still standing mostly,

03:23:45.335 --> 03:23:46.995
some that have toppled over and fallen,

03:23:46.995 --> 03:23:50.925
their rooftops and upper chambers and levels

03:23:50.925 --> 03:23:53.978
now just crumbled debris scattered across the roadway.

03:23:55.025 --> 03:23:59.175
The architecture itself is odd and beautiful.

03:23:59.175 --> 03:24:03.823
There is something very serene and reminiscent

03:24:03.823 --> 03:24:07.473
of some of the finest universities

03:24:07.473 --> 03:24:10.725
or mage towers you'd seen before,

03:24:10.725 --> 03:24:14.973
but with elements of odd alien curves at times.

03:24:14.973 --> 03:24:17.942
The arches have a lot of oval elements to it.

03:24:17.942 --> 03:24:20.245
There's an essence where, as opposed to the bases being

03:24:20.245 --> 03:24:24.378
just a blocky set, they tend to gradually hit the floor.

03:24:25.689 --> 03:24:27.785
Veth, interesting point.

03:24:27.785 --> 03:24:31.885
There are elements of this structural architecture

03:24:31.885 --> 03:24:34.908
that you've seen hints of before.

03:24:36.055 --> 03:24:40.555
Some odd element of

03:24:40.555 --> 03:24:44.097
Gelidon's lair,

03:24:44.097 --> 03:24:44.930
the white dragon.

03:24:44.930 --> 03:24:46.208
SAM: Oh yeah!

03:24:47.109 --> 03:24:49.052
LAURA: Oh wait. I would've seen that, too.

03:24:49.052 --> 03:24:50.412
MATT: You would've seen it as well.

03:24:50.412 --> 03:24:51.245
MARISHA: Oh.

03:24:52.375 --> 03:24:54.485
TRAVIS: Oh, the machines behind the ice.

03:24:54.485 --> 03:24:55.915
LAURA: The purple--

03:24:55.915 --> 03:24:56.748
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Stuff that was hidden

03:24:56.748 --> 03:24:58.531
behind the ice wall that looked like--

03:24:58.531 --> 03:25:01.085
LIAM: It's a testament to how old his lair was.

03:25:01.085 --> 03:25:03.292
MARISHA: And it was cold as fuck.

03:25:03.292 --> 03:25:05.215
MATT: You see similar shapes.

03:25:05.215 --> 03:25:07.715
Everything has a faint curve to it.

03:25:07.715 --> 03:25:09.855
And even edges and corners,

03:25:09.855 --> 03:25:12.068
things seem to round off.

03:25:13.835 --> 03:25:18.823
It's unique, but then much of it is fallen and desolate.

03:25:21.795 --> 03:25:23.365
You can continue to push forward.

03:25:23.365 --> 03:25:25.155
For those who are leading the charge,

03:25:25.155 --> 03:25:27.105
I would ask a perception check, please.

03:25:30.235 --> 03:25:32.725
LAURA: Am I getting any kind of pings?

03:25:32.725 --> 03:25:33.925
TRAVIS: Definitely got to check for traps.

03:25:33.925 --> 03:25:34.758
MATT: Not from the structure.

03:25:34.758 --> 03:25:38.015
SAM: I mean, it's a street, right?
LIAM: I'll look.

03:25:38.015 --> 03:25:40.984
I'm just drinking in every inch of this place.

03:25:40.984 --> 03:25:43.381
TALIESIN: I just ran my perception check. So.

03:25:43.381 --> 03:25:44.485
MATT: Okay.

03:25:44.485 --> 03:25:45.318
TALIESIN: 27.

03:25:47.335 --> 03:25:48.205
LIAM: 25.

03:25:48.205 --> 03:25:50.535
MATT: 25. Okay.

03:25:50.535 --> 03:25:53.725
Pressing forward slowly, carefully

03:25:53.725 --> 03:25:57.305
as the light slowly expands, both yours and the orbs

03:25:57.305 --> 03:26:00.525
that you've summoned begins to reveal stage by stage

03:26:00.525 --> 03:26:04.055
the absolute destruction and faint hints

03:26:04.055 --> 03:26:07.935
of protected echoes of the past,

03:26:07.935 --> 03:26:12.595
little glimpses of life from long ago.

03:26:12.595 --> 03:26:15.435
You can see a smashed cart,

03:26:15.435 --> 03:26:19.365
and long dried,

03:26:19.365 --> 03:26:23.935
partially petrified elements of fruit.

03:26:23.935 --> 03:26:28.005
You can see skeletons, broken,

03:26:28.005 --> 03:26:31.885
and some chewed on and pulled apart.

03:26:31.885 --> 03:26:36.885
You both can see, about 40, 50 feet ahead,

03:26:38.247 --> 03:26:41.045
near the interior base of one of these buildings,

03:26:41.045 --> 03:26:43.748
a very faint blue glow, that catches your eye.

03:26:44.655 --> 03:26:47.765
It stands out amongst the absolute pitch black darkness

03:26:47.765 --> 03:26:49.615
that surrounds you beyond the radius of your light.

03:26:49.615 --> 03:26:51.335
TRAVIS: 40, 50 feet ahead?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:26:51.335 --> 03:26:54.495
TRAVIS: I'll burn a Divine Sense
for celestial, fiend, or undead.

03:26:54.495 --> 03:26:55.818
LIAM: Detect Magic is up.

03:26:57.125 --> 03:27:00.595
MATT: You sense nothing of that sort,

03:27:00.595 --> 03:27:02.978
which brings a bit of comfort to you.

03:27:04.545 --> 03:27:06.135
Detect Magic?
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:27:06.135 --> 03:27:06.968
MATT: You sense--

03:27:08.555 --> 03:27:09.925
it's hard to place.

03:27:09.925 --> 03:27:12.515
It's extremely powerful magic.

03:27:12.515 --> 03:27:13.898
<i>Extremely</i> powerful.

03:27:17.815 --> 03:27:21.345
Abjuration is the closest you can think of,

03:27:21.345 --> 03:27:24.828
but it has an unfamiliar coloration to it.

03:27:25.665 --> 03:27:27.025
That's the best you can make out.

03:27:27.025 --> 03:27:31.085
LIAM: It's completely different than the read I got

03:27:31.085 --> 03:27:36.085
off the gem that Lucien and his party took?

03:27:36.385 --> 03:27:37.485
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Okay.

03:27:37.485 --> 03:27:39.935
Something else entirely, but abjuration.

03:27:39.935 --> 03:27:42.825
TRAVIS: Also, the penance we needed to pay to get in, right?

03:27:42.825 --> 03:27:46.355
To the first chamber where Lucien was, that door.

03:27:47.963 --> 03:27:49.215
Abjuration-based.

03:27:49.215 --> 03:27:51.818
LAURA: Oh, right. Right. Right. Right.

03:27:52.985 --> 03:27:53.818
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:27:53.818 --> 03:27:58.425
LIAM: Oh, the gem for Lucien was for

03:27:58.425 --> 03:28:01.265
not teleportation, but that.

03:28:01.265 --> 03:28:03.665
TALIESIN: It's possible it's
not the same thing over and over again.

03:28:03.665 --> 03:28:06.125
It's possible different materials are required

03:28:06.125 --> 03:28:08.125
for different parts.

03:28:08.125 --> 03:28:10.965
SAM: So this faint glow is from a room or just?

03:28:10.965 --> 03:28:13.279
MATT: It's coming from inside a room at the base

03:28:13.279 --> 03:28:15.935
of one of these buildings that is partially collapsed,

03:28:15.935 --> 03:28:18.915
but still has a somewhat sound base structure

03:28:18.915 --> 03:28:19.748
on the bottom of the floor.

03:28:19.748 --> 03:28:23.045
TALIESIN: Did it seem like it was once a grand building?

03:28:23.045 --> 03:28:24.435
MATT: This one in particular doesn't look

03:28:24.435 --> 03:28:27.535
like it's any-- not like a special structure.

03:28:27.535 --> 03:28:30.425
It doesn't appear to be like a centerpiece of this street.

03:28:30.425 --> 03:28:34.375
TRAVIS: Before Caleb does his thing, how high is this space?

03:28:34.375 --> 03:28:35.565
MATT: From where you're standing now,

03:28:35.565 --> 03:28:39.198
you have about 35 feet before the slate ceiling.

03:28:40.315 --> 03:28:41.695
Once again, the angle is pretty steep,

03:28:41.695 --> 03:28:44.375
so it widens up and you can see the buildings

03:28:44.375 --> 03:28:49.235
to the right side of this particular open roadway,

03:28:49.235 --> 03:28:52.315
two, even three-story buildings, for the most part, can fit

03:28:52.315 --> 03:28:54.555
within this space before it hits another stone wall.

03:28:54.555 --> 03:28:57.235
To the left, it completely cuts off and crushes

03:28:57.235 --> 03:28:58.885
what would have been the other side of the street.

03:28:58.885 --> 03:29:01.665
TRAVIS: Smooth or broken like the pavement, is the ceiling?

03:29:01.665 --> 03:29:03.895
MATT: The ceiling is a broken stone.

03:29:03.895 --> 03:29:05.085
It's a slab.

03:29:05.085 --> 03:29:08.225
It looks like a piece of heavy stone that just fell in

03:29:08.225 --> 03:29:10.112
and leaned and crushed part of it

03:29:10.112 --> 03:29:13.525
and then left this angled bridge over this.

03:29:15.539 --> 03:29:18.447
LIAM: And the light is shining out of

03:29:18.447 --> 03:29:20.655
a building on our level or higher up?

03:29:20.655 --> 03:29:21.488
MATT: On your level.

03:29:21.488 --> 03:29:22.321
LIAM: Yeah.

03:29:22.321 --> 03:29:23.295
MATT: You can't quite see the full source.

03:29:23.295 --> 03:29:25.935
You just see a faint blue glow that's bouncing off

03:29:25.935 --> 03:29:27.805
the inside walls, near the entrance.

03:29:27.805 --> 03:29:29.471
You'd have to get closer.
SAM: Let me go check it out.

03:29:29.471 --> 03:29:30.345
LIAM: Yeah.

03:29:30.345 --> 03:29:32.965
SAM: All right. I'll scuttle ahead.

03:29:32.965 --> 03:29:33.945
MATT: Make a stealth check for me.

03:29:33.945 --> 03:29:35.978
SAM: See if there's--

03:29:35.978 --> 03:29:36.811
Stealth,

03:29:37.701 --> 03:29:38.534
25.

03:29:39.685 --> 03:29:40.983
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Did you roll with advantage?

03:29:40.983 --> 03:29:43.925
SAM: I just did and it's still 25.

03:29:43.925 --> 03:29:44.758
MATT: All righty.

03:29:45.845 --> 03:29:48.075
Moving forward, you glance around the edge.

03:29:48.075 --> 03:29:50.188
In the inside of this chamber,

03:29:51.095 --> 03:29:53.420
you see a dome,

03:29:53.420 --> 03:29:57.503
about 15 or so feet from side to side,

03:29:58.355 --> 03:30:01.610
the semi-translucent, blue arcane energy that just gives off

03:30:01.610 --> 03:30:04.935
this faint blue radiance.

03:30:04.935 --> 03:30:07.325
SAM: Not like Caleb's dome.

03:30:07.325 --> 03:30:10.965
MATT: No. I mean, it's similar in shape,

03:30:10.965 --> 03:30:15.269
but it has a very different luminescence to it,

03:30:15.269 --> 03:30:17.755
and you can't quite see through it,

03:30:17.755 --> 03:30:21.155
though you do see there might be something within,

03:30:21.155 --> 03:30:23.735
but you'd have to get closer to peer through to even notice.

03:30:23.735 --> 03:30:25.445
SAM: And I'm outside the building looking in

03:30:25.445 --> 03:30:27.415
through like a window or a door?

03:30:27.415 --> 03:30:30.838
MATT: An archway that opens into the main chamber.

03:30:32.375 --> 03:30:33.208
SAM: All right.

03:30:33.208 --> 03:30:34.918
Come check it out, everyone.

03:30:35.885 --> 03:30:39.005
I'll check for traps around the doorway.

03:30:39.005 --> 03:30:40.385
MATT: Make an investigation check while the rest

03:30:40.385 --> 03:30:42.242
of you gather up behind--

03:30:42.242 --> 03:30:43.075
SAM: 23.

03:30:43.075 --> 03:30:44.208
MATT: -- Veth and see this same thing.

03:30:44.208 --> 03:30:46.155
TRAVIS: Does it appear like there are any other entrances

03:30:46.155 --> 03:30:47.835
to this room, or this is it?

03:30:47.835 --> 03:30:49.235
MATT: This is the front entrance.

03:30:49.235 --> 03:30:52.235
From the glow that this dome is giving off,

03:30:52.235 --> 03:30:55.985
you can see there would have been, or there is a door

03:30:55.985 --> 03:30:58.245
on the opposite side of this room, like a double door,

03:30:58.245 --> 03:31:00.765
but both the doors are broken off the hinges.

03:31:00.765 --> 03:31:03.422
On the opposite side, you can see clusters of rocks

03:31:03.422 --> 03:31:05.845
that have filled in that space.

03:31:05.845 --> 03:31:07.215
SAM: 23 for traps.
MATT: 23?

03:31:07.215 --> 03:31:08.405
You do not sense traps.

03:31:08.405 --> 03:31:10.464
LIAM: And it's just the ceiling itself of the dome

03:31:10.464 --> 03:31:12.827
that's giving off this light?

03:31:12.827 --> 03:31:14.305
MATT: The entire dome is giving off this light.

03:31:14.305 --> 03:31:15.675
LIAM: Right. It's not like a focal point

03:31:15.675 --> 03:31:17.315
or something that's shining. It's everything.

03:31:17.315 --> 03:31:20.740
MATT: No. The actual dome itself, like an arcane

03:31:20.740 --> 03:31:23.915
semi-sphere that is emanating a strong arcane glow.

03:31:23.915 --> 03:31:26.845
LIAM: Writing, language, symbols?

03:31:26.845 --> 03:31:28.215
MATT: You don't see anything on it, no.

03:31:28.215 --> 03:31:29.688
TRAVIS: Floors?
LIAM: Smooth wall?

03:31:30.665 --> 03:31:32.231
MATT: For, I mean, the dome?

03:31:32.231 --> 03:31:33.965
LIAM: The dome itself is smooth and nondescript

03:31:33.965 --> 03:31:35.465
other than it's shining?

03:31:35.465 --> 03:31:36.905
MATT: Correct. Though make a perception check.

03:31:36.905 --> 03:31:37.738
LIAM: Yeah.

03:31:41.075 --> 03:31:42.105
16.

03:31:42.105 --> 03:31:42.938
MATT: 16.

03:31:45.551 --> 03:31:49.035
You can't quite get a decent enough look

03:31:49.035 --> 03:31:50.725
to see what's within the dome.

03:31:50.725 --> 03:31:52.295
Like the energy is a little too bright

03:31:52.295 --> 03:31:56.370
and it's obfuscating what might be within.

03:31:58.675 --> 03:32:00.935
SAM: Can I throw something at the dome?

03:32:00.935 --> 03:32:01.778
TALIESIN: Back up a bit.

03:32:03.105 --> 03:32:05.275
SAM: I mean, is there anyone else in here? Are we--

03:32:05.275 --> 03:32:06.528
it's just us, right?

03:32:07.455 --> 03:32:09.595
MATT: Right now, it appears that way, yeah.

03:32:09.595 --> 03:32:10.428
TALIESIN: Death Ward.

03:32:10.428 --> 03:32:11.826
TRAVIS: Yeah. Are there any-- that's a good question.

03:32:11.826 --> 03:32:14.455
Are there any hidden corners, or does it look

03:32:14.455 --> 03:32:16.265
like a square or like a rectangle

03:32:16.265 --> 03:32:17.925
where like if you actually popped our head

03:32:17.925 --> 03:32:20.435
and we could see our blind?

03:32:20.435 --> 03:32:21.268
MATT: From when you can tell

03:32:21.268 --> 03:32:24.265
from the blue glow that's lighting the interior,

03:32:24.265 --> 03:32:26.685
it looks like the chamber is mostly rectangular.

03:32:26.685 --> 03:32:27.518
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:32:28.454 --> 03:32:29.869
LIAM: It's just like Pompeii.

03:32:29.869 --> 03:32:31.495
TRAVIS: We just can't see on the other side.

03:32:31.495 --> 03:32:32.775
How tall is the dome?

03:32:32.775 --> 03:32:34.488
15 feet from side to side, but.

03:32:35.735 --> 03:32:37.245
MATT: Side to side 15 feet.

03:32:37.245 --> 03:32:39.785
Semi-sphere, probably about 10 feet tall.

03:32:39.785 --> 03:32:41.495
TRAVIS: It's a big dome.

03:32:41.495 --> 03:32:43.680
SAM: So, I mean, like, dozens and dozens of people

03:32:43.680 --> 03:32:45.113
have been through here.

03:32:45.113 --> 03:32:46.625
LAURA: And this thing is still up.

03:32:46.625 --> 03:32:49.125
SAM: Yeah. So either it's super duper trapped,

03:32:49.125 --> 03:32:50.655
or we can just walk right in it

03:32:50.655 --> 03:32:52.165
and there's nothing in there.

03:32:52.165 --> 03:32:54.775
TRAVIS: No ping from you, right?

03:32:54.775 --> 03:32:55.885
LAURA: No ping.

03:32:55.885 --> 03:32:58.767
So we're not where a threshold crest is.

03:32:58.767 --> 03:33:00.275
TRAVIS: We might not even need this.

03:33:00.275 --> 03:33:01.915
Is the floor the same as it is outside

03:33:01.915 --> 03:33:05.150
of the archway, for the interior of the room?

03:33:05.150 --> 03:33:08.815
MATT: The cobblestone paving seems to end on the inside.

03:33:08.815 --> 03:33:11.145
It looks like it was once probably a smooth wood,

03:33:11.145 --> 03:33:13.075
but most of it is broken and splintered

03:33:13.075 --> 03:33:14.355
and begin to warp and curl.

03:33:14.355 --> 03:33:16.075
And other elements are just broken stone

03:33:16.075 --> 03:33:17.365
and elements that have

03:33:17.365 --> 03:33:19.295
either fallen inward from the destruction

03:33:19.295 --> 03:33:20.625
on the outside street

03:33:20.625 --> 03:33:23.155
or small elements of the structure that have fallen in.

03:33:23.155 --> 03:33:25.575
But for the most part, it's intact.

03:33:25.575 --> 03:33:28.125
MARISHA: Old protection magic, essentially?

03:33:28.125 --> 03:33:31.615
LIAM: I'm just going to take a knee and apparate Frumpkin.

03:33:31.615 --> 03:33:35.457
Take a circle around,
go to the center, around the edges, please.

03:33:35.457 --> 03:33:36.792
TALIESIN: Backing up a bit.

03:33:36.792 --> 03:33:40.945
MATT: Frumpkin does a perimeter around it.

03:33:40.945 --> 03:33:41.898
LIAM: Go to the center.

03:33:43.295 --> 03:33:44.826
SAM: Go into it?
MATT: Into it?

03:33:44.826 --> 03:33:46.995
LIAM: To the center of the room.

03:33:46.995 --> 03:33:49.904
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin goes to the center of the chamber.

03:33:49.904 --> 03:33:52.685
The dome is a little bit to the left side of it.

03:33:52.685 --> 03:33:57.345
LIAM: Okay. Oh, then I steer him underneath the dome.

03:33:57.345 --> 03:34:00.348
MATT: Frumpkin (thuds) hits the dome.

03:34:01.725 --> 03:34:03.136
It's solid.
LIAM: Solid.

03:34:03.136 --> 03:34:05.695
SAM: Can we dispel it?

03:34:05.695 --> 03:34:06.711
LIAM: Yeah, maybe.

03:34:07.925 --> 03:34:10.805
LAURA: The wooden floor around it.

03:34:10.805 --> 03:34:13.380
It goes straight into the wooden floor?

03:34:13.380 --> 03:34:16.480
MATT: Yeah. It meets the ground. There's no gap.

03:34:17.525 --> 03:34:19.391
TALIESIN: Probably is a sphere.

03:34:19.391 --> 03:34:20.224
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

03:34:23.227 --> 03:34:25.211
TALIESIN: Can Frumpkin knock?

03:34:26.115 --> 03:34:27.648
Maybe there's someone in there.

03:34:31.685 --> 03:34:32.665
LIAM: Yeah. He can give it his paw

03:34:32.665 --> 03:34:35.135
a couple of times. (knocking)

03:34:35.135 --> 03:34:39.535
MATT: It doesn't seem to make any sound.

03:34:39.535 --> 03:34:41.545
But as Frumpkin hits it with the claw

03:34:41.545 --> 03:34:43.455
you see the areas where the claws touch it,

03:34:43.455 --> 03:34:46.895
there's a little bit of a very faint increase

03:34:46.895 --> 03:34:50.265
in luminosity in just the one spot for a brief moment.

03:34:50.265 --> 03:34:53.531
So it's reacting, but nothing more than that.

03:34:55.127 --> 03:34:56.782
Caduceus and Beauregard.

03:34:56.782 --> 03:34:58.095
SAM: Uh-oh.

03:34:58.095 --> 03:35:00.245
MATT: Your passive perception is high enough

03:35:00.245 --> 03:35:02.495
that as you begin to focus more on this centerpiece

03:35:02.495 --> 03:35:05.245
you can see shapes within the dome.

03:35:05.245 --> 03:35:06.078
Faintly.

03:35:07.015 --> 03:35:10.575
Like shadows of something that is mostly obscured

03:35:10.575 --> 03:35:11.595
by the arcane energy.

03:35:11.595 --> 03:35:14.515
While Caleb's been very focused on the energy itself,

03:35:14.515 --> 03:35:16.055
you look beyond it and focus

03:35:16.055 --> 03:35:18.665
and you can see the shadows

03:35:18.665 --> 03:35:21.525
of three humanoid shapes.

03:35:21.525 --> 03:35:24.155
TALIESIN: There are people in there?

03:35:24.155 --> 03:35:26.155
MARISHA: Someone's home.
SAM: Moving?

03:35:26.155 --> 03:35:27.821
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: No.

03:35:27.821 --> 03:35:28.654
TRAVIS: Moving or still?

03:35:28.654 --> 03:35:30.145
MARISHA: Moving, right?

03:35:30.145 --> 03:35:31.553
MATT: Still.
MARISHA: Still?

03:35:31.553 --> 03:35:35.005
TALIESIN: Three, three, three people.

03:35:35.005 --> 03:35:36.735
LIAM: Absolutely stock still?

03:35:36.735 --> 03:35:39.105
MATT: As they see this, you look up,
and now that you're closer

03:35:39.105 --> 03:35:42.495
you once again shift your focus from the energy

03:35:42.495 --> 03:35:45.125
to the interior and you can see now on the opposite side

03:35:45.125 --> 03:35:49.491
it looks like three figures.

03:35:49.491 --> 03:35:52.499
Two elven, one human.

03:35:52.499 --> 03:35:54.868
You can't make out their features definitively,

03:35:55.912 --> 03:35:57.555
but they're wearing strange robes

03:35:57.555 --> 03:35:59.865
and they look like they're running,

03:35:59.865 --> 03:36:02.445
but they are locked and frozen.

03:36:02.445 --> 03:36:05.715
Their faces open and aghast, just--

03:36:05.715 --> 03:36:06.845
TRAVIS: In the sphere.

03:36:06.845 --> 03:36:08.320
MATT: In the sphere.
LIAM: This is Pompeii.

03:36:08.320 --> 03:36:11.245
LAURA: Frozen in time.
MARISHA: Yeah. It's totally Pompeii.

03:36:11.245 --> 03:36:13.095
So they're dead,

03:36:13.095 --> 03:36:18.095
and, what, their protective magic lasted this whole time?

03:36:18.315 --> 03:36:20.178
LIAM: I place my hand on the dome.

03:36:21.461 --> 03:36:23.675
MATT: You can feel the resistance.
It's like touching a wall,

03:36:23.675 --> 03:36:25.267
but it has a slight tingle,

03:36:25.267 --> 03:36:26.735
like licking a nine volt battery,

03:36:26.735 --> 03:36:29.518
but all across your hand and fingertips.

03:36:33.848 --> 03:36:38.848
LIAM: I'm going to cast Dispel Magic at level five.

03:36:39.468 --> 03:36:40.301
MATT: Okay.

03:36:41.718 --> 03:36:46.709
You concentrate, focusing on the unraveling

03:36:46.709 --> 03:36:51.135
of the very basis of arcane equations

03:36:52.819 --> 03:36:54.119
and you release.

03:36:55.808 --> 03:36:57.113
Nothing.

03:36:57.113 --> 03:36:57.946
LAURA: Wow.

03:36:59.842 --> 03:37:01.908
I mean, probably some real high ups

03:37:01.908 --> 03:37:04.378
tried to dispel this, too, you know?

03:37:04.378 --> 03:37:06.748
TRAVIS: Can-- I'll follow him into the room.

03:37:06.748 --> 03:37:08.508
Anything in the corners, on the ceiling,

03:37:08.508 --> 03:37:11.688
any sort of-- make our way around the other side

03:37:11.688 --> 03:37:13.808
that was hidden by the sheer size of the dome--

03:37:13.808 --> 03:37:15.328
anything on the far side that's...?

03:37:15.328 --> 03:37:17.028
MATT: The far side, you can see the the archway

03:37:17.028 --> 03:37:18.435
with the door thrown off the hinges.

03:37:19.348 --> 03:37:21.558
You do see a hole in the ceiling

03:37:21.558 --> 03:37:23.978
where it looks like there's an additional chamber above,

03:37:23.978 --> 03:37:25.931
but you can't see much beyond the fact that

03:37:25.931 --> 03:37:27.258
it does continue upward.

03:37:27.258 --> 03:37:29.098
Around you, you can see furniture that's been

03:37:29.098 --> 03:37:30.618
destroyed and fallen over.

03:37:30.618 --> 03:37:32.688
And you do see signs of it being ransacked.

03:37:32.688 --> 03:37:34.108
You can see one of the--

03:37:34.108 --> 03:37:38.558
it would have been a really nice white wood, polished,

03:37:38.558 --> 03:37:41.781
almost cabinetry that has been turned over, pulled open.

03:37:42.898 --> 03:37:45.208
The wood is splintered from the hinges.

03:37:45.208 --> 03:37:48.838
And you can see elements of long shattered china

03:37:48.838 --> 03:37:52.588
and small implements, utilities

03:37:52.588 --> 03:37:55.328
that have been mostly taken and scattered.

03:37:55.328 --> 03:37:58.228
TRAVIS: These elves, does their garb look modern,

03:37:58.228 --> 03:38:00.148
knowing the different places we've been from,

03:38:00.148 --> 03:38:01.878
or is it very, very old?

03:38:01.878 --> 03:38:04.008
MATT: You've never seen attire like this.

03:38:04.008 --> 03:38:06.591
TALIESIN: I have a terrible idea.

03:38:06.591 --> 03:38:09.188
LAURA: (laughs)

03:38:09.188 --> 03:38:11.472
TALIESIN: She's got a sword.

03:38:11.472 --> 03:38:12.948
ASHLEY: I was thinking that,

03:38:12.948 --> 03:38:14.935
but I don't know if it's--

03:38:14.935 --> 03:38:16.118
TRAVIS: I think it's a low--

03:38:16.118 --> 03:38:18.588
ASHLEY: It's pretty low, but I could try it.

03:38:18.588 --> 03:38:20.171
TALIESIN: If it's low, then it's not worth it.

03:38:20.171 --> 03:38:21.828
We've already hit it. We've already hit it hard.

03:38:21.828 --> 03:38:25.098
ASHLEY: 3rd-level or lower, the target ends,

03:38:25.098 --> 03:38:26.445
but if it's--

03:38:26.445 --> 03:38:27.458
TRAVIS: And he did 5th-level.

03:38:27.458 --> 03:38:29.058
ASHLEY: -- 4th-level or higher,

03:38:29.058 --> 03:38:31.330
I have to make an ability check.

03:38:31.330 --> 03:38:32.728
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:38:32.728 --> 03:38:33.578
ASHLEY: I could try it.

03:38:35.168 --> 03:38:36.858
SAM: But in any case, it seems like

03:38:36.858 --> 03:38:41.568
they've been frozen in time at the moment of their demise.

03:38:41.568 --> 03:38:44.258
So, like, either this was a result of them

03:38:44.258 --> 03:38:46.568
protecting themselves or trying to--

03:38:46.568 --> 03:38:49.984
or a result of the explosion that sundered

03:38:49.984 --> 03:38:52.842
or a result of the explosion that sundered

03:38:52.842 --> 03:38:55.378
this part of the town away from the rest of it.

03:38:55.378 --> 03:38:56.978
MARISHA: Or there's something about them

03:38:56.978 --> 03:38:59.398
and one of the mages that's been through here

03:38:59.398 --> 03:39:02.448
put some sort of lock and key on it.

03:39:02.448 --> 03:39:03.748
There's some sort of--

03:39:03.748 --> 03:39:06.188
LAURA: Oh, that's true. They could be locked away

03:39:06.188 --> 03:39:08.288
by somebody doing the excavation.

03:39:08.288 --> 03:39:11.298
MARISHA: Something that could
harbor some sort of importance.

03:39:11.298 --> 03:39:12.391
We don't know.

03:39:12.391 --> 03:39:15.626
LAURA: Can we still see the entrance

03:39:15.626 --> 03:39:17.908
for the main area from here?

03:39:17.908 --> 03:39:19.388
MATT: It's a little ways back, but you can go back

03:39:19.388 --> 03:39:20.728
and glance outward if you'd like.

03:39:20.728 --> 03:39:22.418
There is no light source in that direction.

03:39:22.418 --> 03:39:25.058
So as soon as you step out, it's just darkness.

03:39:25.058 --> 03:39:26.298
You're relying on the two of them

03:39:26.298 --> 03:39:27.848
to get any sort of good view.

03:39:27.848 --> 03:39:30.098
TALIESIN: Caleb, can you can you move a light up to that--

03:39:30.098 --> 03:39:30.931
LIAM: Of course.

03:39:30.931 --> 03:39:33.138
TALIESIN: -- that door up there?

03:39:33.138 --> 03:39:35.438
LIAM: I spiral one up, slowly.

03:39:35.438 --> 03:39:36.271
MATT: Okay.

03:39:37.738 --> 03:39:39.581
Looks like there's another chamber above.

03:39:41.918 --> 03:39:43.848
TRAVIS: 30 feet, you said?

03:39:43.848 --> 03:39:45.523
MATT: About 25, 30 feet.

03:39:46.718 --> 03:39:48.218
TALIESIN: How far can you throw a cat?

03:39:50.041 --> 03:39:51.558
TRAVIS: Yasha probably pretty far.

03:39:53.041 --> 03:39:55.651
ASHLEY: I mean, definitely.

03:39:57.628 --> 03:39:59.608
LAURA: Can you keep one of the globules of light

03:39:59.608 --> 03:40:01.631
at the doorway, Caleb?

03:40:03.118 --> 03:40:07.191
So we can see if anybody is coming behind us?

03:40:08.678 --> 03:40:09.511
LIAM: Yes.

03:40:09.511 --> 03:40:12.055
LAURA: I'm just worried the Tomb
Takers are going to catch up.

03:40:19.433 --> 03:40:20.468
ASHLEY: Do you want me to try it?

03:40:20.468 --> 03:40:21.301
LAURA: Do it.

03:40:22.678 --> 03:40:24.136
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:40:24.136 --> 03:40:26.136
MATT: (meows)

03:40:27.108 --> 03:40:28.574
You going to chuck?
ASHLEY: (whoosh)

03:40:28.574 --> 03:40:30.182
MATT: (surprised cat noise)

03:40:30.182 --> 03:40:31.398
MARISHA: Oh wait, are you throwing the cat--

03:40:31.398 --> 03:40:33.106
I think she was using the sword?

03:40:33.106 --> 03:40:34.398
Or were you throwing the cat?

03:40:34.398 --> 03:40:35.685
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were throwing the cat.

03:40:35.685 --> 03:40:37.468
SAM: Cut the cat in half!

03:40:37.468 --> 03:40:38.301
ASHLEY: Sorry.

03:40:38.301 --> 03:40:39.586
TALIESIN: Dispelled the cat.

03:40:39.586 --> 03:40:40.748
MATT: So what are you doing?

03:40:40.748 --> 03:40:41.915
ASHLEY: I was going to do the sword.

03:40:41.915 --> 03:40:43.581
MATT: Oh okay, up to you. I misunderstood.

03:40:43.581 --> 03:40:44.414
ASHLEY: No, no, no.

03:40:45.278 --> 03:40:46.888
Yeah, I'm going to take out the sword

03:40:46.888 --> 03:40:50.798
and try to Dispel Magic with the sword.

03:40:50.798 --> 03:40:52.859
MATT: Okay, and you pull the sword out.

03:40:53.978 --> 03:40:55.718
Ready-- it's up to you guys.

03:40:55.718 --> 03:40:56.551
LAURA: Back up.

03:40:56.551 --> 03:40:57.384
MATT: Back up a bit.

03:40:58.338 --> 03:41:00.244
Close your eyes, focus.

03:41:02.438 --> 03:41:04.388
One mighty swipe down, the blade hits,

03:41:04.388 --> 03:41:06.838
and you can see the impact, the shell itself,

03:41:06.838 --> 03:41:10.608
the arcane energy alights around where the blade hits.

03:41:10.608 --> 03:41:14.798
There's a slight faint wave of dispelling energy,

03:41:14.798 --> 03:41:16.958
a familiar unraveling net,

03:41:16.958 --> 03:41:20.261
that fades when you pull the blade back.

03:41:21.288 --> 03:41:22.121
No effect.

03:41:24.083 --> 03:41:26.958
LIAM: Yasha Nydoorin, will you throw my cat?

03:41:26.958 --> 03:41:27.791
ASHLEY: Gladly.

03:41:28.899 --> 03:41:30.958
Give me-- give me your cat.

03:41:30.958 --> 03:41:32.540
TRAVIS: Egg throws?
MARISHA: Now we're tossing.

03:41:32.540 --> 03:41:34.228
LIAM: One, two, a three.

03:41:34.228 --> 03:41:35.128
LAURA: (grunts)

03:41:36.035 --> 03:41:37.868
MATT: You hear

03:41:37.868 --> 03:41:39.050
the faint landing above.

03:41:39.050 --> 03:41:40.811
Or you wouldn't hear, it's a cat.

03:41:41.718 --> 03:41:44.068
But nevertheless, Frumpkin is above.

03:41:44.068 --> 03:41:46.898
LIAM: Okay, I place my hand on Yasha's shoulder

03:41:46.898 --> 03:41:48.318
and go into Frumpkin vision.

03:41:48.318 --> 03:41:52.588
MATT: This chamber you can see a large part of the beams,

03:41:52.588 --> 03:41:54.098
the structural beams above it

03:41:54.098 --> 03:41:55.938
have fallen at different angles and a lot

03:41:55.938 --> 03:41:58.080
of this chamber itself is partially collapsed

03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:01.329
and definitely

03:42:01.329 --> 03:42:03.937
not leaving a lot of space to go around.

03:42:03.937 --> 03:42:05.188
Make a perception check.

03:42:05.188 --> 03:42:07.548
LIAM: Fucking cat. Come on, you motherfucker.

03:42:07.548 --> 03:42:08.381
12.

03:42:10.758 --> 03:42:12.586
MATT: Glancing around...

03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:19.183
you don't see much.

03:42:20.245 --> 03:42:21.633
You just see the rubble.

03:42:21.633 --> 03:42:22.941
You see the--

03:42:23.908 --> 03:42:26.722
SAM: All right, Yasha, throw me up there.

03:42:26.722 --> 03:42:29.898
LAURA: Can I have said in this time

03:42:29.898 --> 03:42:31.955
that we're all standing around and doing this,

03:42:31.955 --> 03:42:34.163
can I have been casting Commune?

03:42:35.542 --> 03:42:36.450
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: It's only a minute.

03:42:36.450 --> 03:42:37.938
LAURA: With the Traveler?

03:42:37.938 --> 03:42:39.386
It only takes a minute?
TALIESIN: It only takes a minute, yeah.

03:42:39.386 --> 03:42:40.758
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I was thinking it took--

03:42:40.758 --> 03:42:42.788
MATT: Which, by the way, your--

03:42:42.788 --> 03:42:44.105
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: That has faded, by the way.

03:42:44.105 --> 03:42:45.912
LAURA: Yeah, I figured.
MATT: Yes, you may.

03:42:45.912 --> 03:42:48.156
LAURA: Okay I'm going to...

03:42:51.548 --> 03:42:52.381
Hi!

03:42:53.428 --> 03:42:54.768
MATT: (as Artagan) "Hello."

03:42:54.768 --> 03:42:59.768
LAURA: So, can you, like, you know,
move around here really fast

03:42:59.918 --> 03:43:02.718
and let me know, like, which direction

03:43:02.718 --> 03:43:06.121
the crest would be? Like, if I say: is it over there,

03:43:06.121 --> 03:43:08.198
can you say yes or what?

03:43:11.518 --> 03:43:14.238
MATT: "Probably, to an extent. I mean,

03:43:14.238 --> 03:43:15.941
"there is strange magic about,

03:43:15.941 --> 03:43:18.832
"but what is it you want to know?"

03:43:18.832 --> 03:43:20.081
LAURA: I mean, are we in the right area

03:43:20.081 --> 03:43:23.573
for what the Tomb Takers are looking for?

03:43:27.164 --> 03:43:28.522
MATT: "Yes and no?"

03:43:29.772 --> 03:43:31.748
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:43:31.748 --> 03:43:32.878
LAURA: That's not very helpful.

03:43:32.878 --> 03:43:35.878
MATT: "I'm-- no, I'm sorry, but you
have to ask the right questions."

03:43:36.758 --> 03:43:38.183
LAURA: This is stupid.

03:43:40.008 --> 03:43:42.758
Do we need-- oh, god, there's so many questions

03:43:42.758 --> 03:43:44.188
I could ask you right now.

03:43:44.188 --> 03:43:46.210
MATT: "I could have so many answers."

03:43:46.210 --> 03:43:48.588
LAURA: Do we need what's inside of this blue dome?

03:43:48.588 --> 03:43:49.524
MATT: "Probably not.

03:43:49.524 --> 03:43:50.538
"It's been there for quite some time

03:43:50.538 --> 03:43:53.271
"and the poor things are just locked in those final moments.

03:43:54.358 --> 03:43:56.479
"More of a relic of history."

03:43:58.158 --> 03:44:00.994
LAURA: Okay, threshold crest.

03:44:00.994 --> 03:44:02.436
MATT: "Mmm.

03:44:02.436 --> 03:44:05.036
"I happen to have a history."

03:44:06.624 --> 03:44:08.432
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:44:08.432 --> 03:44:09.625
LAURA: To the west?

03:44:09.625 --> 03:44:10.458
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:44:10.458 --> 03:44:11.751
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:44:13.183 --> 03:44:14.621
MATT: "Probably, I mean,

03:44:15.558 --> 03:44:18.148
"the tunnels seem to go deepest there."

03:44:18.148 --> 03:44:19.848
MARISHA: Deepest there.

03:44:19.848 --> 03:44:20.681
LAURA: All right.

03:44:21.828 --> 03:44:24.676
Thank you so much for all of your guidance.

03:44:24.676 --> 03:44:29.088
MATT: "Well, thank you for requesting it."

03:44:29.088 --> 03:44:31.138
MARISHA: -- threshold crest.

03:44:31.138 --> 03:44:34.398
LAURA: He says we should head to the west.

03:44:34.398 --> 03:44:35.898
MATT: "Indeed I do."

03:44:35.898 --> 03:44:37.528
LAURA: Go deeper.

03:44:37.528 --> 03:44:39.046
TRAVIS: That fucking guy.
SAM: Cool cool cool.

03:44:39.046 --> 03:44:40.663
TRAVIS: Should we try throwing Veth up into the compartment?

03:44:40.663 --> 03:44:41.704
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:44:41.704 --> 03:44:43.765
SAM: Just toss me up quick. (screams)

03:44:43.765 --> 03:44:45.378
MATT: Roll a strength check.

03:44:45.378 --> 03:44:46.211
LAURA: Can I help?

03:44:46.211 --> 03:44:48.155
Maybe we can assist and do a--
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:44:48.155 --> 03:44:50.788
TRAVIS: Basket toss.
MATT: Yep.

03:44:50.788 --> 03:44:51.978
TRAVIS: Form a square.

03:44:51.978 --> 03:44:55.897
ASHLEY: Well, that's a natural 19, so then...

03:44:55.897 --> 03:44:57.133
LAURA: Try for 20, try for the 20.

03:44:57.133 --> 03:44:59.011
ASHLEY: Try for 20.
TRAVIS: Pow.

03:44:59.011 --> 03:45:00.604
ASHLEY: That's a 19 again.

03:45:02.058 --> 03:45:03.199
LIAM: Double guns.

03:45:04.458 --> 03:45:07.628
MATT: You emerge and step down on the inside.

03:45:07.628 --> 03:45:09.828
Even with the collapsed upper chamber

03:45:09.828 --> 03:45:11.428
because of your halfling stature,

03:45:11.428 --> 03:45:13.468
you can get around here pretty easily.

03:45:13.468 --> 03:45:15.708
SAM: I'll just look for anything interesting.

03:45:15.708 --> 03:45:16.818
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

03:45:16.818 --> 03:45:18.118
TRAVIS: Goggles activated.
ASHLEY: Be careful.

03:45:18.118 --> 03:45:19.793
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was-- yeah.

03:45:19.793 --> 03:45:20.859
TRAVIS: Be careful!

03:45:21.758 --> 03:45:22.788
SAM: 23 as always.

03:45:22.788 --> 03:45:24.818
MATT: 23, okay.

03:45:24.818 --> 03:45:27.676
Looking through, you can find,

03:45:29.748 --> 03:45:31.598
I mean, most of this you can tell a lot of this

03:45:31.598 --> 03:45:33.178
has been picked clean.

03:45:33.178 --> 03:45:34.328
You know, you're not the first to come here.

03:45:34.328 --> 03:45:36.176
This isn't a fresh dungeon to be delved.

03:45:36.176 --> 03:45:39.867
This is a place that has been thoroughly looted

03:45:39.867 --> 03:45:43.141
by multiple sources and multiple interests.

03:45:43.998 --> 03:45:47.151
But you do find a

03:45:50.557 --> 03:45:55.478
buried and largely forgotten, small metallic box

03:45:56.358 --> 03:45:59.378
that is currently wedged under

03:45:59.378 --> 03:46:02.191
a part of a collapsed wall on the side.

03:46:03.912 --> 03:46:07.348
It might take a little bit of tugging to pull it away

03:46:07.348 --> 03:46:10.556
from its current hiding spot, but it can be done.

03:46:10.556 --> 03:46:11.748
SAM: I'll get out the dagger

03:46:11.748 --> 03:46:15.008
and start sort of pulling, wrenching it out.

03:46:15.008 --> 03:46:16.668
MATT: Sure.

03:46:16.668 --> 03:46:18.158
SAM: First, I'll check for traps.

03:46:18.158 --> 03:46:20.181
MATT: Go for it, make an investigation check.

03:46:21.088 --> 03:46:22.138
SAM: 25.

03:46:22.138 --> 03:46:23.847
MATT: No traps.

03:46:23.847 --> 03:46:25.872
SAM: (creaking sounds)

03:46:26.780 --> 03:46:28.243
TRAVIS: I don't like the way Marisha's looking.

03:46:28.243 --> 03:46:30.356
MATT: Make a strength check.

03:46:30.356 --> 03:46:31.678
SAM: Strength?

03:46:31.678 --> 03:46:33.458
MATT: This is to wedge it free.

03:46:34.383 --> 03:46:35.978
LAURA: I know.

03:46:35.978 --> 03:46:37.086
SAM: 12.

03:46:38.258 --> 03:46:39.518
MATT: 12?
SAM: Uh-huh.

03:46:39.518 --> 03:46:40.788
MATT: That's-- it takes you a moment,

03:46:40.788 --> 03:46:43.798
but you do manage to pull it out.

03:46:43.798 --> 03:46:45.620
You fall onto your ass for a second

03:46:45.620 --> 03:46:48.192
and you guys hear the (low thump).

03:46:48.192 --> 03:46:49.747
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, what's happening?

03:46:49.747 --> 03:46:51.438
SAM: It's fine. Everything's fine.
LAURA: What did you find?

03:46:51.438 --> 03:46:53.278
SAM: It's fine, I'm alive.

03:46:53.278 --> 03:46:55.065
MATT: You sit back up and you look at it

03:46:55.065 --> 03:46:57.438
and as you do the lid flips open.

03:46:57.438 --> 03:46:58.898
And it's about that big.

03:46:58.898 --> 03:47:02.312
And looking inside, you can see there's a strange device.

03:47:02.312 --> 03:47:06.831
It's like four triangles.

03:47:08.988 --> 03:47:10.528
All placed together.

03:47:10.528 --> 03:47:12.938
And it's metallic with intricate--

03:47:12.938 --> 03:47:14.118
LAURA: Like this?
MATT: -- designs and scrolling.

03:47:14.118 --> 03:47:15.918
Yeah, like a d4, if you will.

03:47:17.058 --> 03:47:20.368
But it has like glyphs on it.

03:47:20.368 --> 03:47:23.018
And it looks like sliding discs.

03:47:23.018 --> 03:47:26.558
It looks like an odd magical device.

03:47:26.558 --> 03:47:28.718
SAM: I will pocket it.

03:47:28.718 --> 03:47:30.971
And if-- is Frumpkin still up here?

03:47:30.971 --> 03:47:31.804
MATT: Frumpkin's up here.

03:47:31.804 --> 03:47:33.658
SAM: I'll grab Frumpkin.
LIAM: (trills)

03:47:33.658 --> 03:47:38.168
SAM: And I will-- if I jump through down through the hole,

03:47:38.168 --> 03:47:42.788
can I like slide down the dome to get down?

03:47:42.788 --> 03:47:44.921
MATT: You can try and angle for it, if you want to.

03:47:45.968 --> 03:47:47.568
Roll an acrobatics check for me.

03:47:49.348 --> 03:47:52.388
SAM: 19 plus 10.

03:47:52.388 --> 03:47:56.078
MATT: You-- this is an odd shot

03:47:56.078 --> 03:47:59.528
and by all accounts should not work.

03:47:59.528 --> 03:48:01.078
But you do the math in your head.

03:48:01.078 --> 03:48:02.128
You back up a little bit

03:48:02.128 --> 03:48:05.688
and you do like a super fast low leap.

03:48:05.688 --> 03:48:07.868
So you come in at a fast side angle.

03:48:07.868 --> 03:48:11.041
And as you do, you glance off the top of the dome

03:48:11.041 --> 03:48:13.141
and slide down the other side.

03:48:14.248 --> 03:48:17.578
It doesn't do damage, but your tailbone

03:48:17.578 --> 03:48:19.801
is going to suck in the morning.

03:48:19.801 --> 03:48:21.618
But you guys watch as, unexpectedly,

03:48:21.618 --> 03:48:24.938
Veth just (impacting) off to the other side.

03:48:24.938 --> 03:48:26.158
The momentum causes you to tumble

03:48:26.158 --> 03:48:27.788
and you roll over your shoulder and stand up.

03:48:27.788 --> 03:48:30.954
And you're like, "Ha! (groans)"

03:48:30.954 --> 03:48:32.188
TRAVIS: Veth, that was incredible.

03:48:32.188 --> 03:48:33.320
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

03:48:33.320 --> 03:48:34.370
TRAVIS: Did that hurt?

03:48:34.370 --> 03:48:36.388
SAM: Yes, a lot, a lot.

03:48:36.388 --> 03:48:39.125
I found a cat and a box.

03:48:40.193 --> 03:48:41.276
TRAVIS: And a box?
SAM: Yeah.

03:48:41.276 --> 03:48:42.742
MARISHA: What's in the box?

03:48:42.742 --> 03:48:43.716
What's in the box?
SAM: I don't know,

03:48:43.716 --> 03:48:45.016
I feel like there's some experiment

03:48:45.016 --> 03:48:46.459
we could do with a cat and a box.

03:48:46.459 --> 03:48:47.527
I don't know what--

03:48:47.527 --> 03:48:49.785
LIAM: Is it in there or is it?

03:48:49.785 --> 03:48:50.688
SAM: But I don't know what.

03:48:51.538 --> 03:48:52.798
Here take the box, too.

03:48:52.798 --> 03:48:53.631
LIAM: Okay.

03:48:53.631 --> 03:48:54.464
SAM: Identify it.

03:48:54.464 --> 03:48:56.148
LIAM: All right, I'll talk to you later. (poofs)

03:48:57.448 --> 03:48:58.728
MARISHA: (yelps)

03:48:59.903 --> 03:49:01.678
LIAM: Do we have 10 minutes?

03:49:01.678 --> 03:49:04.455
SAM: Maybe. Oh, you need to be
still while you do this, right?

03:49:04.455 --> 03:49:05.288
TRAVIS: Yes, we do.

03:49:05.288 --> 03:49:07.890
ASHLEY: Can I carry you while you're doing that?

03:49:08.747 --> 03:49:11.549
LIAM: No, I would feel so awkward.
MARISHA: Oh, that'd be cute.

03:49:11.549 --> 03:49:13.946
What if we, like, I could put you on one shoulder

03:49:13.946 --> 03:49:16.218
and Yasha could be on the other like a palanquin?

03:49:16.218 --> 03:49:17.218
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:49:17.218 --> 03:49:18.051
MARISHA: But made of people.

03:49:18.051 --> 03:49:19.408
LIAM: I will try anything once.

03:49:19.408 --> 03:49:20.838
LAURA: Yeah, let's try it.

03:49:20.838 --> 03:49:22.118
ASHLEY: Okay, we're going west.

03:49:22.118 --> 03:49:24.428
We'll hold you. You do your thing. Let's go.

03:49:24.428 --> 03:49:25.378
MARISHA: Okay, ready?

03:49:25.378 --> 03:49:27.765
One, two, three (grunts).

03:49:27.765 --> 03:49:30.451
LIAM: I begin ritual casting Identify.

03:49:30.451 --> 03:49:34.273
MATT: This is the strangest crowd surf

03:49:34.273 --> 03:49:35.838
that anyone's done.

03:49:35.838 --> 03:49:38.188
Okay, are you guys, are you heading deeper

03:49:38.188 --> 03:49:39.021
or are you heading back?

03:49:39.021 --> 03:49:42.178
LAURA: We're heading west deep,
like where the Traveler said.

03:49:42.178 --> 03:49:44.003
MATT: Okay, cool. So be heading back to where you started

03:49:44.003 --> 03:49:45.686
then heading west.
TRAVIS: Towards the-- yeah, the junction.

03:49:45.686 --> 03:49:48.538
MATT: Okay, along the way, you ritual cast Identify

03:49:48.538 --> 03:49:49.508
which takes takes ten minutes, you said?

03:49:49.508 --> 03:49:50.341
LIAM: Yeah.

03:49:50.341 --> 03:49:51.958
MATT: Okay, so it'll take you a little while.
LIAM: ♪ In the arms-- ♪

03:49:51.958 --> 03:49:54.449
So walking back--
LIAM: ♪ -- of the angels. ♪

03:49:54.449 --> 03:49:56.432
(laughter)

03:49:56.432 --> 03:49:58.398
MATT: Head back in and head westward.

03:49:58.398 --> 03:50:02.608
So heading into the western chamber,

03:50:02.608 --> 03:50:06.298
you see a shattered, once magically sealed door

03:50:06.298 --> 03:50:10.108
that leads into this next area that now lies fallen.

03:50:10.108 --> 03:50:13.208
It is like tumbled forward and left

03:50:13.208 --> 03:50:15.598
not quite as broken as the doors

03:50:15.598 --> 03:50:17.578
you saw on the chamber where the dome was set,

03:50:17.578 --> 03:50:19.728
but it looks like it was pulled off

03:50:19.728 --> 03:50:23.161
of its mooring and left to tumble forward.

03:50:24.778 --> 03:50:26.908
Beyond that, you can see

03:50:26.908 --> 03:50:30.725
a long corridor that has visible structural damage

03:50:30.725 --> 03:50:33.538
even at this initial glance inward.

03:50:33.538 --> 03:50:37.048
Not unlike the chamber, the long corridor

03:50:37.048 --> 03:50:40.108
that you guys had eventually climbed to

03:50:40.108 --> 03:50:41.558
in the previous excavation.

03:50:41.558 --> 03:50:42.428
But there are differences.

03:50:42.428 --> 03:50:43.628
This one is wider.

03:50:43.628 --> 03:50:45.988
Previous one was almost single file.

03:50:45.988 --> 03:50:47.827
This one is about 15 feet wide.

03:50:47.827 --> 03:50:48.805
LAURA: Oh, wow.

03:50:48.805 --> 03:50:50.488
MATT: But has a similar feel to it,

03:50:50.488 --> 03:50:54.498
similar design. It is smooth and almost metallic,

03:50:54.498 --> 03:50:56.498
but you can see elements and panels have fallen.

03:50:56.498 --> 03:50:59.558
You can see there were structural beams above it

03:50:59.558 --> 03:51:01.818
that were pushed in from some sort of heavy impact

03:51:01.818 --> 03:51:03.218
that now punch through.

03:51:03.218 --> 03:51:05.388
You can see shredded elements of materials

03:51:05.388 --> 03:51:07.828
that were above that now dangle loose

03:51:07.828 --> 03:51:09.338
into the space for you to walk through.

03:51:09.338 --> 03:51:11.426
But that is the path ahead.

03:51:11.426 --> 03:51:14.468
TALIESIN: Does it look like someone
has trounced through here

03:51:14.468 --> 03:51:16.228
in the last couple days?

03:51:16.228 --> 03:51:17.061
Are there, like-- is the--

03:51:17.061 --> 03:51:19.011
MATT: Make a perception or investigation check.

03:51:21.288 --> 03:51:22.668
TALIESIN: 18.

03:51:22.668 --> 03:51:25.348
MATT: 18? Yeah, it does.

03:51:25.348 --> 03:51:29.431
It looks like there's been some recent-ish foot traffic.

03:51:31.048 --> 03:51:32.288
It's hard to tell how long long it's been,

03:51:32.288 --> 03:51:35.032
but you can see there has been travel in and out.

03:51:35.032 --> 03:51:37.668
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

03:51:37.668 --> 03:51:41.128
LAURA: Does it look you know, like normal people tracks

03:51:41.128 --> 03:51:42.981
or does it look like monster tracks?

03:51:43.818 --> 03:51:45.198
MATT: This looks like normal people tracks.

03:51:45.198 --> 03:51:46.031
LAURA: Okay.

03:51:47.598 --> 03:51:49.768
TALIESIN: I don't know what Nonagoni would look like,

03:51:49.768 --> 03:51:52.448
but okay, yeah, there's been some people through here

03:51:52.448 --> 03:51:55.198
relatively recently, I guess.

03:51:55.198 --> 03:51:57.201
MARISHA: This one person has nine feet.

03:51:59.078 --> 03:52:00.178
TALIESIN: Oh god, they're here.

03:52:01.366 --> 03:52:03.066
SAM: It was just a corridor, have we--?

03:52:03.066 --> 03:52:04.207
MATT: It's just a corridor ahead of you,

03:52:04.207 --> 03:52:06.588
a long corridor.
SAM: Keep on going.

03:52:06.588 --> 03:52:08.605
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: How you doing there, wizard?

03:52:08.605 --> 03:52:09.438
LIAM: Shush.

03:52:09.438 --> 03:52:10.863
MARISHA: Okay, fine.
SAM: He's doing a

You push further lowering him

03:52:23.521 --> 03:52:27.263
from some of the fallen regions

03:52:27.263 --> 03:52:29.604
of this long, long hallway

03:52:29.604 --> 03:52:32.048
where you can see beams-- braces have been built

03:52:32.048 --> 03:52:35.988
and placed up in here you can see, more recent construction,

03:52:35.988 --> 03:52:37.968
though not, you know, of the highest quality,

03:52:37.968 --> 03:52:41.778
enough to try and put brace beams
to keep elements of this hallway

03:52:41.778 --> 03:52:43.328
from collapsing for those who are excavating

03:52:43.328 --> 03:52:45.081
their way further into these ruins.

03:52:46.703 --> 03:52:50.086
30, 50, 100.

03:52:50.086 --> 03:52:53.678
120 feet, the hallway begins to turn.

03:52:53.678 --> 03:52:55.378
And you follow it at that side angle.

03:52:56.228 --> 03:52:58.187
MARISHA: Turn left or turn right, turn north?

03:52:58.187 --> 03:52:59.958

MARISHA: North?

03:53:07.268 --> 03:53:10.658
MATT: You can see there's like heavy elements

03:53:10.658 --> 03:53:12.608
of almost like a rubbery rope dangling

03:53:12.608 --> 03:53:14.298
from some of these open broken areas

03:53:14.298 --> 03:53:15.498
that push past you

03:53:15.498 --> 03:53:19.958
that give this odd, almost like a skin touch

03:53:19.958 --> 03:53:22.458
against your shoulders as they shift to the side

03:53:22.458 --> 03:53:23.721
like heavy cables.

03:53:25.858 --> 03:53:28.058
LAURA: Does it seem organic or does it seem like--?

03:53:30.848 --> 03:53:32.680

03:53:32.680 --> 03:53:33.513
LAURA: Yeah.

03:53:39.873 --> 03:53:43.501
15, which is pretty good for me on investigation.

03:53:43.501 --> 03:53:45.478
MATT: You look at it. It is flexible,

03:53:45.478 --> 03:53:48.988
it does not appear organic, necessarily,

03:53:48.988 --> 03:53:51.078
though the texture does have some similarities

03:53:51.078 --> 03:53:53.278
in its flexibility and the smoother

03:53:54.878 --> 03:53:57.241
sensation of the outside texture.

03:53:57.241 --> 03:53:59.341
It does appear to be hollow on the inside.

03:54:00.378 --> 03:54:01.883
That's the best you can make out about it.

03:54:01.883 --> 03:54:03.418
LAURA: Weird.

03:54:03.418 --> 03:54:04.668

TALIESIN: Tubes?

03:54:05.817 --> 03:54:07.909

03:54:14.698 --> 03:54:17.228
for the purposes of timeliness at this point,

03:54:17.228 --> 03:54:18.348
you have completed your ritual.

03:54:28.948 --> 03:54:31.380

03:55:02.538 --> 03:55:05.958
that have nearly entirely collapsed.

03:55:05.958 --> 03:55:08.098
Except you can see now more of these makeshift braces

03:55:08.098 --> 03:55:09.928
have been placed up to give areas where normally

03:55:09.928 --> 03:55:12.618
this 15-foot wide hallway becomes a small bit

03:55:12.618 --> 03:55:14.358
of single file advancement.

03:55:14.358 --> 03:55:15.788
You have to squeeze through

03:55:15.788 --> 03:55:18.068
and at some points almost crawl to continue

03:55:18.068 --> 03:55:22.438
and as that opens up you come to a door.

03:55:22.438 --> 03:55:26.238
A heavy metallic door that looks like

03:55:26.238 --> 03:55:29.458
it's also partially off its mooring and hinges

03:55:29.458 --> 03:55:33.881
and is just wedged preventing further passage.

03:55:39.468 --> 03:55:40.768
SAM and TRAVIS: Wedged preventing--

03:55:40.768 --> 03:55:42.935
MARISHA: Stuck door. Stuck door?

03:55:42.935 --> 03:55:46.538
SAM: And wedged by people or--?

03:55:46.538 --> 03:55:48.668
TRAVIS: That doesn't seem like something that would stop us.

03:55:48.668 --> 03:55:51.578
LAURA: If we touch the door what does it feel like?

03:55:51.578 --> 03:55:52.801
MATT: A cold metal door.

03:55:55.283 --> 03:55:56.268
TRAVIS: Yasha?

03:55:56.268 --> 03:55:58.358
LAURA: Oh, well, okay, yes.

03:55:58.358 --> 03:55:59.858
LAURA: What were you going to say?

03:55:59.858 --> 03:56:01.368
LAURA: I was going to say I could try my paints

03:56:01.368 --> 03:56:04.028
but we can try to move it with strength first.

03:56:04.028 --> 03:56:05.498
SAM: Smart.

03:56:05.498 --> 03:56:07.098
LAURA: This might-- does it look like it's supporting

03:56:07.098 --> 03:56:08.749
the ceiling at all, the door?

03:56:10.008 --> 03:56:12.131
MATT: Make an investigation check to check out.

03:56:14.508 --> 03:56:16.091
LAURA: Oh, even better, 17!

03:56:17.238 --> 03:56:20.798
MATT: It does not look like it is supporting,

03:56:20.798 --> 03:56:23.568
the door isn't, from what you can tell, at least.

03:56:23.568 --> 03:56:24.401
LAURA: Okay.

03:56:24.401 --> 03:56:26.946
MATT: The frame that it's in probably is more

03:56:26.946 --> 03:56:30.518
of the structural element, I'm sure the door would help,

03:56:30.518 --> 03:56:33.074
but you do not-- you do not see, based on the slight angle

03:56:33.074 --> 03:56:35.928
that it's at, like it's currently bearing a lot of weight.

03:56:35.928 --> 03:56:37.158
LAURA: Okay.

03:56:37.158 --> 03:56:38.388
ASHLEY: Try to give it a go.

03:56:38.388 --> 03:56:39.435
LAURA: Should we try it together?

03:56:39.435 --> 03:56:41.368
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's try together.
TRAVIS: Smash sisters go for it.

03:56:41.368 --> 03:56:42.201
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:56:42.201 --> 03:56:44.408
MATT: Okay, so either you both roll independently

03:56:44.408 --> 03:56:46.982
or one of you rolls with advantage.

03:56:46.982 --> 03:56:48.499
ASHLEY: Let's go, let's both roll.

03:56:48.499 --> 03:56:49.857
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Go for it.

03:56:52.348 --> 03:56:53.381
LAURA: That's cocked.

03:56:56.238 --> 03:56:57.599
ASHLEY: 23.

03:56:57.599 --> 03:56:58.840
LAURA: Ooh!

03:57:00.418 --> 03:57:01.658
LAURA: This is strength?

03:57:01.658 --> 03:57:03.551
MATT: Yeah, just add your strength modifier.

03:57:05.324 --> 03:57:06.337
LAURA: 26.

03:57:07.428 --> 03:57:09.095
LIAM: Muscles flex.
MATT: What's your modifier?

03:57:09.095 --> 03:57:09.948
LAURA: Oh wait--
MATT: Not saving throw.

03:57:09.948 --> 03:57:11.648
LAURA: Yeah, my modifier is plus three.

03:57:12.498 --> 03:57:14.748
MATT: Oh, so you rolled a 23?

03:57:14.748 --> 03:57:15.808
LAURA: Yeah.

03:57:15.808 --> 03:57:16.641
MATT: On a d20?

03:57:16.641 --> 03:57:18.038
LAURA: I Guided myself.

03:57:18.038 --> 03:57:18.871
MATT: Oh, gotcha.

03:57:18.871 --> 03:57:20.288
LAURA: I rolled 19 plus four.

03:57:20.288 --> 03:57:22.028
MATT: Gotcha, okay I was like,

03:57:22.028 --> 03:57:24.329
the math is breaking my brain here.

03:57:24.329 --> 03:57:25.298
LAURA: Guidanced.

03:57:25.298 --> 03:57:26.288
MATT: Okay, cool.

03:57:26.288 --> 03:57:28.968
LAURA: That's-- when I do this that means I Guided myself,

03:57:28.968 --> 03:57:30.308
but I didn't say it out loud.

03:57:30.308 --> 03:57:33.642
MATT: No worries, but now I know
this isn't, "Bless your heart."

03:57:33.642 --> 03:57:35.468
This is Guidance, got it.

03:57:35.468 --> 03:57:37.591
TRAVIS: Dumbledore when he casts.
MATT: Yeah.

03:57:37.591 --> 03:57:42.138
Okay, between the two of you pulling on the door,

03:57:42.138 --> 03:57:44.478
you begin to tug back and you can see there are

03:57:44.478 --> 03:57:48.128
heavy metallic chains and cables along the top

03:57:48.128 --> 03:57:50.228
that it's attached to.

03:57:50.228 --> 03:57:51.488
And you realize at this point,

03:57:51.488 --> 03:57:52.988
it's not so much pulling it out of the way,

03:57:52.988 --> 03:57:55.958
it's trying to re-align it.

03:57:55.958 --> 03:57:58.838
And with your strength, you shift it back into its space

03:57:58.838 --> 03:58:00.546
and as it does you hear

03:58:00.546 --> 03:58:03.518
(rumbling, chains moving)

03:58:03.518 --> 03:58:06.508
And the wall begins to lift itself up.

03:58:06.508 --> 03:58:09.433
The door is pulled up--
ASHLEY: That's such a cool noise.

03:58:09.433 --> 03:58:11.541
MATT: -- into a ceiling chamber--
MARISHA: Amazing.

03:58:11.541 --> 03:58:15.186
MATT: -- and reveals an open room before you.

03:58:15.186 --> 03:58:17.561
TALIESIN: Boy, you get trapped in there if things go wrong.
MARISHA: Fuck you, door.

03:58:17.561 --> 03:58:19.607
LAURA: Hey, we took out the door.

03:58:19.607 --> 03:58:22.020
TRAVIS: A perception check into
the new room that just opened up.

03:58:22.020 --> 03:58:23.445
LIAM: You think you're fucking with Vox Machina?

03:58:23.445 --> 03:58:25.038
Fuck off.

03:58:25.038 --> 03:58:26.372
MARISHA: Who do you think we are?

03:58:26.372 --> 03:58:28.147
You think this is campaign one? Fuck you.

03:58:28.147 --> 03:58:30.628
(laughter)

03:58:30.628 --> 03:58:31.658
LIAM: Fuck your doors.

03:58:31.658 --> 03:58:36.048
MATT: Beyond the door, as the light begins to spill in,

03:58:36.048 --> 03:58:38.189
you glance into a

03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:43.189
comparatively preserved lightless space.

03:58:43.468 --> 03:58:45.741
You can see elements of a chamber.

03:58:46.718 --> 03:58:49.498
The furniture has been tossed around,

03:58:49.498 --> 03:58:51.318
but the floor is not as broken or shattered

03:58:51.318 --> 03:58:53.748
as previous areas you've been in.

03:58:53.748 --> 03:58:56.548
It is a fairly solid stone

03:58:57.868 --> 03:59:01.078
marble or concrete smooth floor

03:59:01.078 --> 03:59:04.538
with some texture that leads into a minor

03:59:04.538 --> 03:59:06.561
series of steps that lead into a

03:59:06.561 --> 03:59:11.561
central, raised platform, maybe 20 feet by 20 feet.

03:59:11.628 --> 03:59:13.348
But the chamber continues on beyond that.

03:59:13.348 --> 03:59:15.098
You'd have to send the light source further in

03:59:15.098 --> 03:59:17.298
to see more of the chamber.

03:59:17.298 --> 03:59:20.528
But what you do see, as the light trickles in,

03:59:20.528 --> 03:59:23.768
beyond the fallen tables and scattered

03:59:25.078 --> 03:59:29.758
broken implements or tools,

03:59:29.758 --> 03:59:32.318
you can see large pieces of glass,

03:59:32.318 --> 03:59:35.590
large rounded, jagged parts

03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:37.431
of broken glass containers or sculptures, something.

03:59:37.431 --> 03:59:40.922
of broken glass containers or sculptures, something.

03:59:40.922 --> 03:59:45.268
They are a bit thrown about the floor ahead of you.

03:59:45.268 --> 03:59:46.658
SAM: Those tubes, are they hanging?

03:59:46.658 --> 03:59:48.828
LAURA: We've seen broken glass before, you guys,

03:59:50.128 --> 03:59:52.188
in the Happy Fun Ball

03:59:52.188 --> 03:59:54.838
and it wasn't-- it didn't end well.

03:59:54.838 --> 03:59:56.601
There were creatures in the glass.

03:59:57.438 --> 03:59:58.865
SAM: I don't remember that at all.

03:59:58.865 --> 04:00:01.158
TALIESIN: Oh, wow, I do.

04:00:01.158 --> 04:00:03.228
LAURA: Well, this could be the same thing,

04:00:03.228 --> 04:00:06.338
Halas was in the same time.

04:00:06.338 --> 04:00:09.643
TALIESIN: Is it giving the vibe?
I feel like it's giving the vibe.

04:00:09.643 --> 04:00:11.148
MATT: You can see some similarity.

04:00:11.148 --> 04:00:13.168
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's giving the vibe.

04:00:13.168 --> 04:00:16.438
SAM: Are there those tubes from the ceiling again?

04:00:16.438 --> 04:00:18.308
MARISHA: Yeah, same question. The tubes,

04:00:18.308 --> 04:00:19.188
the dangling tubes.

04:00:19.188 --> 04:00:20.518
MATT: Yeah, from the hallway?

04:00:20.518 --> 04:00:21.968
MARISHA: Yeah, are they in here?

04:00:21.968 --> 04:00:24.588
MATT: As you step inward, and if you'd like to make

04:00:24.588 --> 04:00:26.528
a perception check to pick out more detail

04:00:26.528 --> 04:00:27.628
for those who want to.

04:00:30.250 --> 04:00:34.568
You can see there are dark alcoves to the right and left.

04:00:34.568 --> 04:00:37.531
And then another set of

04:00:37.531 --> 04:00:39.588
wider alcoves beyond that.

04:00:39.588 --> 04:00:41.238
You cannot still see the opposite ends

04:00:41.238 --> 04:00:43.128
as you can have slowly stepping into the chamber

04:00:43.128 --> 04:00:44.401
inspecting around. What'd you roll?

04:00:44.401 --> 04:00:45.259
TALIESIN: 22.

04:00:45.259 --> 04:00:48.418
MATT: 22, Anybody else roll for that? Just you, all right.

04:00:48.418 --> 04:00:50.868
You glance up and along the ceiling.

04:00:50.868 --> 04:00:54.278
You see there is a raised central area

04:00:54.278 --> 04:00:57.218
about 30 or so feet up.

04:00:57.218 --> 04:01:00.738
There is a recess in which there are numerous

04:01:00.738 --> 04:01:03.138
glass structures held aloft.

04:01:03.138 --> 04:01:07.748
You see blue and green spherical or cylindrical

04:01:07.748 --> 04:01:09.578
glass tubes that are affixed,

04:01:09.578 --> 04:01:11.488
though it looks like whatever sort of order

04:01:11.488 --> 04:01:13.968
they were originally placed in, they've been jostled

04:01:13.968 --> 04:01:16.288
and shifted out of their current setting.

04:01:16.288 --> 04:01:18.208
You can see elements of them are broken.

04:01:18.208 --> 04:01:20.108
And on the top platform, you can see

04:01:20.108 --> 04:01:22.868
where other elements that may have been held up there

04:01:22.868 --> 04:01:25.088
have fallen and broken and led to the glass

04:01:25.088 --> 04:01:27.308
shatter across the ground ahead of you.

04:01:27.308 --> 04:01:30.158
You can see more of these tubes connecting between them

04:01:30.158 --> 04:01:31.628
and heading further and deeper

04:01:31.628 --> 04:01:34.088
beyond sight into the ceiling above them.

04:01:34.088 --> 04:01:36.998
This definitely has some sort of laboratory vibe,

04:01:36.998 --> 04:01:38.408
but it's of a different

04:01:39.778 --> 04:01:42.038
a different flavor of design and presentation

04:01:42.038 --> 04:01:44.578
than what you encountered in the Happy Fun Ball.

04:01:44.578 --> 04:01:45.671
TALIESIN: I don't like it.

04:01:46.558 --> 04:01:48.078
MATT: The actual structure in the inside of here,

04:01:48.078 --> 04:01:52.848
much like the semi-organic and clean feel

04:01:52.848 --> 04:01:56.138
as to the buildings that you saw on the street has

04:01:57.958 --> 04:01:59.618
very, very fine craftsmanship,

04:01:59.618 --> 04:02:03.011
but it's, the design aesthetic is very--

04:02:04.128 --> 04:02:07.218
I have no other way to describe it than crisp and clean.

04:02:07.218 --> 04:02:11.908
A lot of geometric angles and a lot of long lines.

04:02:11.908 --> 04:02:13.051
It has an almost,

04:02:15.758 --> 04:02:18.658
I fear to use the term because
I don't want to misrepresent it,

04:02:18.658 --> 04:02:20.898
but it has a little more of a sci-fi feel

04:02:20.898 --> 04:02:24.968
than what you've been used to encountering

04:02:24.968 --> 04:02:25.908
in this campaign.

04:02:25.908 --> 04:02:27.428
But for the players' mind's eye,

04:02:27.428 --> 04:02:29.588
that will help best to describe what you're encountering.

04:02:29.588 --> 04:02:32.448
TALIESIN: Very fine tools were used to make this.

04:02:32.448 --> 04:02:33.931
TRAVIS: The other party came this way.

04:02:33.931 --> 04:02:37.320
Have we looked for tracks on the floor, dust disturbed?

04:02:37.320 --> 04:02:39.708
LAURA: Not since we opened the door.

04:02:39.708 --> 04:02:41.821
TRAVIS: Yeah, is it undisturbed in here?

04:02:43.498 --> 04:02:45.258
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

04:02:45.258 --> 04:02:46.458
TALIESIN: I'll join you in that.

04:02:49.298 --> 04:02:52.158
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17.

04:02:52.158 --> 04:02:52.991
TALIESIN: 24.

04:02:52.991 --> 04:02:56.265
MATT: 24. Indeed, there have been footprints,

04:02:56.265 --> 04:02:59.223
and at this point now, as you're looking through and

04:02:59.223 --> 04:03:00.658
the smell begins to hit you,

04:03:00.658 --> 04:03:02.831
there is a very faint,

04:03:04.358 --> 04:03:07.288
chemical, burning smell, to the point where like

04:03:07.288 --> 04:03:10.588
at certain points your nostrils, the inside seems to almost

04:03:10.588 --> 04:03:13.538
open your sinuses from the inhale.

04:03:13.538 --> 04:03:15.668
And there is a dark liquid now

04:03:15.668 --> 04:03:17.518
that you can see on the upper platform

04:03:17.518 --> 04:03:19.652
that has congealed over time, like

04:03:19.652 --> 04:03:24.108
a dark black liquid that has--

04:03:24.108 --> 04:03:27.651
SAM: The smell, do I recognize it chemically?

04:03:29.568 --> 04:03:31.448
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

04:03:31.448 --> 04:03:32.281
MARISHA: Come on.

04:03:34.708 --> 04:03:36.374
SAM: 13.
MATT: 13.

04:03:36.374 --> 04:03:38.899
It's not the same smell that you had

04:03:38.899 --> 04:03:41.868
with the black puddings previously,

04:03:41.868 --> 04:03:46.481
but it does have definitely a caustic nature to it.

04:03:48.315 --> 04:03:50.308
You do see some platforms on top

04:03:50.308 --> 04:03:52.200
beyond just the shattered stuff,
as you begin to push inward.

04:03:52.200 --> 04:03:55.408
They're like raised

04:03:55.408 --> 04:03:58.933
podiums of stone that have their own designs on top of them.

04:03:58.933 --> 04:04:00.658
And from what you guys are looking, you do see

04:04:00.658 --> 04:04:05.163
some writing on the walls and the top of these platforms.

04:04:05.163 --> 04:04:06.271
TALIESIN: Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

04:04:06.271 --> 04:04:10.278
MATT: In fact, you see some writing on some fallen plaques.

04:04:10.278 --> 04:04:13.696
This is the first sign you've seen of any sort of language.

04:04:13.696 --> 04:04:14.829
MARISHA: Hmm.

04:04:14.829 --> 04:04:16.028
TALIESIN: Does this looks familiar?

04:04:16.028 --> 04:04:18.108
LIAM: Yeah, I cast Comprehend Language.

04:04:18.108 --> 04:04:18.941
MATT: Okay.

04:04:21.128 --> 04:04:22.911
As you're-- how long does it take to cast?

04:04:22.911 --> 04:04:26.119
LIAM: A min-- uh. (thinking noises)

04:04:27.665 --> 04:04:29.548
TALIESIN: Trying to keep an eye on the other side

04:04:29.548 --> 04:04:32.248
of the door, too. If that thing, if anything,

04:04:32.248 --> 04:04:33.628
any sound comes from the other chamber,

04:04:33.628 --> 04:04:35.036
if that door just starts to squeak,

04:04:35.036 --> 04:04:36.875
I want to know about it.
LIAM: It's an action.

04:04:36.875 --> 04:04:39.108
MATT: It's an action? Okay, easy enough.

04:04:39.108 --> 04:04:41.828
You glance over and you see

04:04:43.358 --> 04:04:45.278
inked across a damaged wall

04:04:45.278 --> 04:04:46.388
as you step further in

04:04:46.388 --> 04:04:49.198
and you begin to be barely able to see

04:04:49.198 --> 04:04:50.458
some of the light bouncing

04:04:50.458 --> 04:04:52.098
on the opposite end of this chamber.

04:04:52.098 --> 04:04:54.408
So there's the smaller alcoves to the immediate

04:04:54.408 --> 04:04:56.118
right and left as you enter.

04:04:56.118 --> 04:04:58.068
There is the larger, more rounded alcoves

04:04:58.068 --> 04:04:59.988
in the center of this chamber to the right and left

04:04:59.988 --> 04:05:01.398
and there's the raised platform in the center,

04:05:01.398 --> 04:05:02.908
and the glass is scattered all among it,

04:05:02.908 --> 04:05:05.318
and there are these two smaller podium-like

04:05:05.318 --> 04:05:07.371
daises that rise up on top of that.

04:05:08.791 --> 04:05:13.791
Beyond that, you can see
an additional alcove across the way.

04:05:13.868 --> 04:05:17.058
And these large metal cages

04:05:17.058 --> 04:05:21.548
or containment structures on that opposite end.

04:05:21.548 --> 04:05:24.898
And there are two walls that face that side,

04:05:24.898 --> 04:05:26.418
like metal walls.

04:05:26.418 --> 04:05:29.478
LAURA: And we don't hear anything outside of us.

04:05:29.478 --> 04:05:33.955
MATT: Currently, no, it's just quiet.
TALIESIN: I don't like this.

04:05:33.955 --> 04:05:37.218
MATT: You see, across the wall, as you

04:05:37.218 --> 04:05:39.686
focus in on a damaged aspect of it

04:05:39.686 --> 04:05:41.478
where some of the stone has fallen.

04:05:41.478 --> 04:05:46.219
You see a sign on it that is partially hanging, that reads:

04:05:46.219 --> 04:05:49.028
Development Laboratory Procedures.

04:05:49.028 --> 04:05:51.211
MARISHA: Development Laboratory Procedures.

04:05:52.188 --> 04:05:55.408
MATT: You do see, off to the side,
that one of these fallen signs

04:05:55.408 --> 04:05:56.868
that is broken and shattered

04:05:56.868 --> 04:06:00.186
but the part of the language is legible, it reads:

04:06:00.186 --> 04:06:02.321
Primordial Applications.

04:06:04.378 --> 04:06:09.358
You can see now there is a sign of writing

04:06:09.358 --> 04:06:12.798
above one of those metal walls off to the front

04:06:12.798 --> 04:06:16.678
and left of that far alcove that reads:

04:06:16.678 --> 04:06:18.138
Biological Weapons Research.

04:06:18.138 --> 04:06:19.738
SAM: Oh my god.

04:06:21.138 --> 04:06:23.368
MATT: And upon the top of one of these

04:06:26.378 --> 04:06:28.188
raised podium-like things, you could see

04:06:28.188 --> 04:06:29.988
all sort of like symbols and glyphs.

04:06:30.908 --> 04:06:34.798
And there are two marble,

04:06:34.798 --> 04:06:39.168
circular buttons that sit on top,

04:06:41.281 --> 04:06:44.068
like palm-sized glyphs that are put into these

04:06:44.068 --> 04:06:46.858
circular, raised bits of stone

04:06:46.858 --> 04:06:50.673
and the text on there says: Emergency Flush.

04:06:50.673 --> 04:06:51.798
LIAM: Flesh or flush?

04:06:51.798 --> 04:06:53.400
MATT: Emergency flush.

04:06:53.400 --> 04:06:55.253
TALIESIN: Ooh. Hmm.

04:06:55.253 --> 04:06:57.361
LAURA: That's a good thing if
there's a monster in here, though.

04:06:57.361 --> 04:06:58.928
TALIESIN: Or that's the thing that closes the doors

04:06:58.928 --> 04:07:00.838
and fills it with liquid.

04:07:00.838 --> 04:07:01.998
LAURA: Probably, yeah.

04:07:01.998 --> 04:07:04.058
LIAM: Nothing in here is aglow, right?

04:07:04.058 --> 04:07:04.948
It's all dark?

04:07:04.948 --> 04:07:06.578
MATT: From what you can tell.

04:07:06.578 --> 04:07:07.708
TALIESIN: What's the other button say?

04:07:07.708 --> 04:07:10.355
LAURA: Do we have to Detect Magic?
MATT: The other button has no text on it.

04:07:10.355 --> 04:07:13.878
MARISHA: And this all looks pretty ransacked?

04:07:13.878 --> 04:07:15.995
MATT: From what you can tell,

04:07:15.995 --> 04:07:18.431
it looks like it's been partially ransacked.

04:07:19.988 --> 04:07:21.738
You can make a more thorough investigation, if you'd like.

04:07:21.738 --> 04:07:24.258
MARISHA: Sure.
MATT: Make an investigation check.

04:07:24.258 --> 04:07:26.038
TALIESIN: Is there another door
on the other side of this chamber,

04:07:26.038 --> 04:07:28.088
or we haven't gotten there yet?

04:07:28.088 --> 04:07:29.418
MATT: You don't see another door,

04:07:29.418 --> 04:07:32.468
you see there's the alcoves and the metal walls.

04:07:32.468 --> 04:07:34.238
There is that sign where it's running

04:07:34.238 --> 04:07:35.558
that says Biological Weapons Research

04:07:35.558 --> 04:07:37.575
is above the metal wall

04:07:37.575 --> 04:07:40.078
and the cross and left hand side, like an angled.

04:07:40.078 --> 04:07:42.458
LIAM: That is such a strange word to him, to us.

04:07:42.458 --> 04:07:45.598
MATT: Yeah, like a lot of this is not quite clicking.

04:07:45.598 --> 04:07:48.439
It feels strange and

04:07:48.439 --> 04:07:50.614
you don't really have anything to understand

04:07:50.614 --> 04:07:52.418
and connect it to.

04:07:52.418 --> 04:07:53.978
MARISHA: 26.

04:07:53.978 --> 04:07:56.768
MATT: 26. A lot of this has been looked through,

04:07:56.768 --> 04:07:59.118
a lot of this has been combed through.

04:08:01.138 --> 04:08:03.028
But you can see the central platform

04:08:03.028 --> 04:08:06.953
where those podiums are

04:08:06.953 --> 04:08:08.548
and where that black liquid

04:08:08.548 --> 04:08:12.398
that is settled and congealed on parts of it are,

04:08:12.398 --> 04:08:13.828
there's only a few footprints,

04:08:13.828 --> 04:08:16.588
it looks like people tended to avoid that central platform,

04:08:16.588 --> 04:08:18.301
but people have walked up there.

04:08:19.878 --> 04:08:21.068
TRAVIS: And this is probably dumb,

04:08:21.068 --> 04:08:24.558
there's no sort of like switches near the entrance

04:08:24.558 --> 04:08:27.588
that we came in, anything could be flipped or pushed.

04:08:27.588 --> 04:08:28.888
MATT: Make a perception check.

04:08:31.348 --> 04:08:32.248
TRAVIS: 21.

04:08:32.248 --> 04:08:33.081
MATT: 21.

04:08:33.081 --> 04:08:34.408
TRAVIS: These are good rolls.

04:08:34.408 --> 04:08:36.738
MATT: Looking around the sides, not really.

04:08:36.738 --> 04:08:38.828
There's a lot of damage visible

04:08:38.828 --> 04:08:43.628
on the outsides of where the door's frame is,

04:08:43.628 --> 04:08:45.868
but the frame itself is a very thick metal

04:08:45.868 --> 04:08:47.628
and it looks like it's holding up

04:08:47.628 --> 04:08:49.778
the majority of the structure on this side.

04:08:50.788 --> 04:08:52.938
You can see heavy cracks that run through

04:08:52.938 --> 04:08:56.551
both sides of the wall. You don't see any signs of a lever.

04:08:57.503 --> 04:08:59.068
TRAVIS: We don't even know what sort of power source

04:08:59.068 --> 04:09:01.858
this sort of laboratory would run on.

04:09:03.418 --> 04:09:04.251
Should we keep going,

04:09:04.251 --> 04:09:06.128
should we check the podium in the middle?

04:09:06.128 --> 04:09:08.558
LIAM: No, one moment. I cast Detect Magic in here

04:09:08.558 --> 04:09:10.571
to see if anything feels active.

04:09:12.298 --> 04:09:14.221
MATT: Of the chamber,

04:09:19.408 --> 04:09:23.288
there is very faint magical residue

04:09:23.288 --> 04:09:27.478
on some of these shattered glass pieces.

04:09:27.478 --> 04:09:29.048
When I say shattered, there are small pieces

04:09:29.048 --> 04:09:31.068
and there are large jagged sections

04:09:31.068 --> 04:09:34.438
that are resting on the side.

04:09:34.438 --> 04:09:35.438
Very faint magical residue,

04:09:35.438 --> 04:09:39.101
as well as that dark congealed liquid.

04:09:40.155 --> 04:09:44.428
There are two stronger magical sources

04:09:44.428 --> 04:09:47.398
emanating from those two raised stones with

04:09:47.398 --> 04:09:49.638
the glyphs on them, on that central podium.

04:09:49.638 --> 04:09:51.868
LIAM: And what's the read on those,

04:09:51.868 --> 04:09:53.479
as far as school?

04:09:55.168 --> 04:09:56.081
If there is one?

04:09:56.081 --> 04:09:57.768
MATT: This is less of a school of magic,

04:09:57.768 --> 04:10:01.168
they are not a spell,

04:10:01.168 --> 04:10:04.652
they are not a sigil that contains an effect.

04:10:04.652 --> 04:10:06.440
It looks like they are just connective.

04:10:06.440 --> 04:10:07.498
ASHLEY: What's written on that part?

04:10:07.498 --> 04:10:10.278
LIAM: The two that are glowing, were there words

04:10:10.278 --> 04:10:13.488
connected to those or no, those are just unintelligible.

04:10:13.488 --> 04:10:16.218
MATT: There are words, they're unintelligible.

04:10:16.218 --> 04:10:17.058
LIAM: Yeah.

04:10:17.058 --> 04:10:19.988
MATT: There is one phrase on it that says Emergency Flush.

04:10:19.988 --> 04:10:21.913
LIAM: Right.
MATT: And that is on the top end of it.

04:10:21.913 --> 04:10:23.931
And there are those two stones.

04:10:25.158 --> 04:10:28.448
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object again.

04:10:28.448 --> 04:10:29.638
MATT: Okay.

04:10:29.638 --> 04:10:32.368
LAURA: Searching for the crest.

04:10:32.368 --> 04:10:35.908
MATT: You sense a faint draw,

04:10:37.008 --> 04:10:40.678
if you're facing deeper into the chamber,

04:10:40.678 --> 04:10:43.423
to the front and left hand side.

04:10:44.883 --> 04:10:46.164
LAURA: We should go that way.

04:10:48.018 --> 04:10:51.008
MARISHA: Towards that darkish corridor

04:10:51.008 --> 04:10:53.883
that we haven't looked towards, that way?

04:10:53.883 --> 04:10:54.899
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:10:54.899 --> 04:10:56.578
TRAVIS: Are there drains in the floor?

04:10:56.578 --> 04:10:58.558
MATT: And as Jester points over that direction

04:10:58.558 --> 04:11:00.458
that's in the direction of where that scrawling on the wall

04:11:00.458 --> 04:11:02.978
reads Biological Weapons Research.

04:11:02.978 --> 04:11:06.855
SAM: Biological Weapons. This place is evil, man!

04:11:06.855 --> 04:11:08.030
MARISHA: Yeah, this place is terrifying.

04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:10.158
TALIESIN: I kind of want to leave this room

04:11:10.158 --> 04:11:11.861
and push one of the buttons.

04:11:12.878 --> 04:11:14.171
But not in this room.

04:11:15.108 --> 04:11:17.568
LIAM: I think I feel a little pressed for time.

04:11:17.568 --> 04:11:18.401
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:11:18.401 --> 04:11:21.768
LIAM: Yeah, I feel like we should push beyond this.

04:11:21.768 --> 04:11:22.873
LAURA: Yeah, I agree.

04:11:22.873 --> 04:11:24.393
MARISHA: Let's see what we can find--
TALIESIN: What direction we need to go.

04:11:24.393 --> 04:11:25.643
LAURA: We can get rid of that crest.

04:11:25.643 --> 04:11:28.930
I want to try to destroy it before Lucien gets here.

04:11:28.930 --> 04:11:30.433
SAM: Yeah, that's true, that's true.

04:11:30.433 --> 04:11:31.529
We should press on.

04:11:33.828 --> 04:11:34.661
LIAM: Okay.

04:11:36.228 --> 04:11:38.551
SAM: Yeah, I guess I'll go forward and.

04:11:39.918 --> 04:11:41.108
LIAM: I'll go side by side with you

04:11:41.108 --> 04:11:42.941
with the globules just to read--

04:11:42.941 --> 04:11:45.833
LAURA: Try to move a bit stealthily

04:11:45.833 --> 04:11:48.948
for fear that giant baby cries will find us.

04:11:48.948 --> 04:11:49.948
SAM: Sure.

04:11:49.948 --> 04:11:51.638
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check.

04:11:51.638 --> 04:11:52.571
SAM: Stealth check.

04:11:53.828 --> 04:11:55.188
LAURA: I can cast--

04:11:55.188 --> 04:11:56.168
SAM: 30.

04:11:56.168 --> 04:11:57.418
MATT: 30, nice.
LAURA: Wow.

04:11:58.277 --> 04:11:59.360
TALIESIN: Crying adult.

04:12:00.918 --> 04:12:03.184
SAM: Why couldn't the sign have just said, like,

04:12:03.184 --> 04:12:05.636
Flubber, or something cute on it?

04:12:05.636 --> 04:12:07.572
TRAVIS: Flubber.
SAM: I don't know.

04:12:07.572 --> 04:12:09.945
TALIESIN: Where's an emergency exit when you need one?

04:12:11.568 --> 04:12:13.738
Bathroom?
SAM: Yeah!

04:12:13.738 --> 04:12:15.996
LIAM: You and I have been wondering
about this for a long time.

04:12:15.996 --> 04:12:16.829
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

04:12:20.558 --> 04:12:23.198
SAM: Yeah, so I'm stealthing over towards the door.

04:12:23.198 --> 04:12:26.128
Is it a doorway that leads out of here or just a hallway?

04:12:26.128 --> 04:12:29.068
MATT: No, no, the chamber is closed off.

04:12:29.068 --> 04:12:30.678
There is no exit. What you do see

04:12:30.678 --> 04:12:34.401
are the two metallic walls on the opposite end.

04:12:35.616 --> 04:12:38.048
One of which has a cage structure in front of it

04:12:38.048 --> 04:12:39.128
and the other is the one that has

04:12:39.128 --> 04:12:41.128
the sign Biological Weapons Research above.

04:12:41.128 --> 04:12:44.558
SAM: And your ping was through the biological wall?

04:12:44.558 --> 04:12:45.488
LAURA: Yeah.

04:12:45.488 --> 04:12:46.808
SAM: But it's just a metal wall.

04:12:46.808 --> 04:12:48.160
MATT: Just a metal wall.

04:12:48.160 --> 04:12:50.108
SAM: Can I search around the corners

04:12:50.108 --> 04:12:52.098
to see if it slides or raises?

04:12:52.098 --> 04:12:53.571
MATT: Make an investigation check.

04:12:55.449 --> 04:12:56.891
SAM: 24.

04:12:56.891 --> 04:12:59.268
MATT: 24. It does look like it would slide upward.

04:12:59.268 --> 04:13:03.088
You see a seam above, though the framing is different,

04:13:03.088 --> 04:13:05.368
it looks similar to the door that you entered from.

04:13:05.368 --> 04:13:09.328
So it looks like it would have a similar raised system.

04:13:09.328 --> 04:13:12.298
SAM: Ladies, we got another garage door.

04:13:12.298 --> 04:13:14.648
LAURA: Just lift it.
ASHLEY: Try to lift it.

04:13:15.558 --> 04:13:17.458
MATT: Okay, both of you?

04:13:17.458 --> 04:13:19.083
Roll strength checks.

04:13:19.083 --> 04:13:21.683
SAM: Ah, I'll just check around for traps, just in case.

04:13:23.428 --> 04:13:24.648
23.

04:13:24.648 --> 04:13:26.526
MATT: 23. Does not appear to be trapped.

04:13:26.526 --> 04:13:28.996
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you a d4.

04:13:28.996 --> 04:13:29.829
ASHLEY: Great.

04:13:29.829 --> 04:13:31.098
SAM: I'm going to stand back.

04:13:34.039 --> 04:13:35.264
ASHLEY: Oof.

04:13:35.264 --> 04:13:37.298
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

04:13:37.298 --> 04:13:38.378
LAURA: 21 for me.

04:13:38.378 --> 04:13:39.211
MATT: 21?

04:13:42.074 --> 04:13:42.907
ASHLEY: 15.

04:13:42.907 --> 04:13:44.318
MATT: 15. You both pull underneath.

04:13:44.318 --> 04:13:45.728
It's hard to get a grip,

04:13:45.728 --> 04:13:47.838
but there is some of the metal rim

04:13:47.838 --> 04:13:49.908
that you can go ahead and get your fingers beneath

04:13:49.908 --> 04:13:51.658
and one, two, three

04:13:51.658 --> 04:13:53.898
with all your might you pull, the muscles bulge

04:13:53.898 --> 04:13:55.689
the veins pop.

04:13:55.689 --> 04:13:57.430
It's not budging.

04:13:58.928 --> 04:14:01.488
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my paints.

04:14:01.488 --> 04:14:03.788
I'm going to paint a little hole in it

04:14:03.788 --> 04:14:06.158
so I can peek through the door.

04:14:06.158 --> 04:14:07.658
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

04:14:07.658 --> 04:14:08.673
MATT: You go ahead and paint.

04:14:13.078 --> 04:14:13.988
It's normal paint.

04:14:13.988 --> 04:14:16.261
MARISHA: Oh shit. It's not going to work here.

04:14:16.261 --> 04:14:18.818
LAURA: Fuck! I don't like this place.

04:14:18.818 --> 04:14:20.488
SAM: Just wait, what is--

04:14:21.578 --> 04:14:23.288
Does everything not work down here,

04:14:23.288 --> 04:14:24.898
or it's just the paint?

04:14:24.898 --> 04:14:28.355
MARISHA: Might just be more
powerful magic than the paint is.

04:14:28.355 --> 04:14:30.205
TRAVIS: I try and make myself look like Veth.

04:14:31.163 --> 04:14:32.121
MATT: Okay, you like Veth.

04:14:32.121 --> 04:14:34.120
TRAVIS: All right, we're good.
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

04:14:34.120 --> 04:14:35.712
ASHLEY: So there was the

04:14:36.906 --> 04:14:39.396
the emergency flush area.

04:14:39.396 --> 04:14:41.798
SAM: I make myself look like Fjord.
ASHLEY: You said there's two buttons there?

04:14:41.798 --> 04:14:45.060
MATT: Correct, there's one to
the front and one in the back.

04:14:45.060 --> 04:14:48.148
The top one has the Emergency Flush on that one.

04:14:48.148 --> 04:14:51.890
The second one doesn't have any additional scrolling on it.

04:14:52.768 --> 04:14:54.711
MARISHA: Does it look like there are--

04:14:57.388 --> 04:14:58.428
hang on a second.

04:14:58.428 --> 04:15:01.078
I'm going to dart to the other corridors.

04:15:01.078 --> 04:15:03.698
Do they all have the same lock shut tight

04:15:05.258 --> 04:15:10.258
doors off of this corridor, chamber?

04:15:10.794 --> 04:15:13.398
MATT: The very first door that was already fallen forward

04:15:13.398 --> 04:15:15.988
and off the side looks like it was a similar structure

04:15:15.988 --> 04:15:17.488
to the one that you've just moved through

04:15:17.488 --> 04:15:18.588
and the one they're trying to lift.

04:15:18.588 --> 04:15:22.851
So there is a consistency in the design.

04:15:23.938 --> 04:15:26.248
MARISHA: And then there was another offshoot, right,

04:15:26.248 --> 04:15:30.178
on the opposite side of this chamber?

04:15:30.178 --> 04:15:31.048
TALIESIN: No, that's the main chamber.

04:15:31.048 --> 04:15:31.888
TRAVIS: Just alcoves.

04:15:31.888 --> 04:15:33.438
MATT: Yeah, there's just alcoves,

04:15:33.438 --> 04:15:35.548
just these central parts of the laboratory

04:15:35.548 --> 04:15:36.998
where you can see there are shelves

04:15:36.998 --> 04:15:38.378
that have tumbled forward

04:15:38.378 --> 04:15:41.011
or been turned over that are empty.

04:15:41.011 --> 04:15:43.489
LAURA: I wonder if the emergency flush
button was already pushed.

04:15:43.489 --> 04:15:45.401
MARISHA: I think that's exactly what it is.

04:15:45.401 --> 04:15:46.498
LAURA: So we have to hit the other one

04:15:46.498 --> 04:15:48.968
or hit it again and make the doors rise up?

04:15:48.968 --> 04:15:49.898
MARISHA: I don't know.

04:15:49.898 --> 04:15:51.768
LAURA: I'm going to burn a 5th-level slot

04:15:51.768 --> 04:15:55.468
and cast Telekinesis to try to lift the door.

04:15:55.468 --> 04:15:57.022
MATT: Okay, go ahead.
LIAM: 1000 pounds of weight.

04:15:57.022 --> 04:15:58.280
I mean, there's nothing to do.

04:15:58.280 --> 04:15:59.548
It's not being held by anything.

04:15:59.548 --> 04:16:03.118
So it's just the weight is too much or not.

04:16:03.118 --> 04:16:03.951
MATT: All right.

04:16:06.458 --> 04:16:07.808
Go ahead and roll a d20

04:16:07.808 --> 04:16:10.961
and add the strength modifier of--

04:16:11.971 --> 04:16:13.037
Well, it's a 1000 pounds of weight?

04:16:13.037 --> 04:16:13.888
LIAM: Yeah.

04:16:13.888 --> 04:16:14.738
MATT: It's too heavy.

04:16:18.028 --> 04:16:19.862
MARISHA: Okay, let's push some buttons.

04:16:19.862 --> 04:16:23.448
SAM: Figure out some buttons.
LAURA: That was intense.

04:16:23.448 --> 04:16:24.868
TRAVIS: Should we clear out of the room

04:16:24.868 --> 04:16:27.343
and have a hand press the other one,

04:16:27.343 --> 04:16:28.818
the opposite of flush.

04:16:28.818 --> 04:16:31.253
TALIESIN: I think perhaps that would be a good idea.

04:16:31.253 --> 04:16:32.086
LAURA: Yeah, we'll back up.

04:16:32.086 --> 04:16:34.128
MATT: The metal door that you guys managed to function-

04:16:34.128 --> 04:16:35.958
it's not so much that you lifted it,

04:16:35.958 --> 04:16:39.270
but because you managed to wedge it back into its slot

04:16:39.270 --> 04:16:40.963
and it pulled itself back up.

04:16:40.963 --> 04:16:43.308
Yeah, it should not have been-- you would not have been able

04:16:43.308 --> 04:16:44.874
to lift that door.
LAURA: Okay.

04:16:44.874 --> 04:16:46.536
MARISHA: But it was basically knocked off its track.

04:16:46.536 --> 04:16:48.202
TRAVIS: I run over and I kick the door

04:16:48.202 --> 04:16:50.544
that Caleb tried to pull up with--

04:16:50.544 --> 04:16:52.828
I kick the shit out of it.

04:16:52.828 --> 04:16:54.083
MATT: You do so, well done.

04:16:54.083 --> 04:16:56.361
SAM: Break four toes.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:16:56.361 --> 04:16:58.884
TRAVIS: I've got it back in place. Whatever happens next.

04:16:58.884 --> 04:17:01.318
(laughter)

04:17:01.318 --> 04:17:04.028
SAM: All right, so back up and I'll push the button?

04:17:04.028 --> 04:17:05.148
What button am I pushing?

04:17:05.148 --> 04:17:09.253
MARISHA: I guess let's start with the emergency flush.

04:17:09.253 --> 04:17:10.774
TALIESIN: I feel like the other button.

04:17:10.774 --> 04:17:12.016
LAURA: The other button, I think the other button.

04:17:12.016 --> 04:17:13.893
TALIESIN: I think the emergency flush is what happened here

04:17:13.893 --> 04:17:15.026
and filled it with acid.

04:17:15.026 --> 04:17:17.233
MARISHA: But if it's already down,
is it like a light switch?

04:17:17.233 --> 04:17:18.066
We don't know.

04:17:18.066 --> 04:17:19.728
TRAVIS: Did we see any drains in the floor?

04:17:19.728 --> 04:17:22.444
ASHLEY: The door that we moved in place was already--

04:17:22.444 --> 04:17:24.252
LAURA: Up.
ASHLEY: Was already up.

04:17:24.252 --> 04:17:25.302
So we just put it in the thing

04:17:25.302 --> 04:17:27.988
and then it went up so that button was already--

04:17:27.988 --> 04:17:30.448
TRAVIS: It was down and wedged out.

04:17:30.448 --> 04:17:31.970
And then we pushed it in and it went.

04:17:31.970 --> 04:17:34.515
LIAM: It was just slightly off of its groove.

04:17:34.515 --> 04:17:35.730
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:17:35.730 --> 04:17:36.813
LAURA: But it raised up.

04:17:36.813 --> 04:17:39.365
ASHLEY: But it raised up as soon as it pushed it in.

04:17:39.365 --> 04:17:41.015
So I think something was already--

04:17:42.188 --> 04:17:43.337
TALIESIN: Holes in the ceiling?

04:17:43.337 --> 04:17:44.562
TRAVIS: Fuck, this is hard.

04:17:44.562 --> 04:17:46.318
MATT: It's a little high up to see specifically,

04:17:46.318 --> 04:17:49.578
you do see all the glass elements up there

04:17:49.578 --> 04:17:51.838
and cables and wire that are connecting them.

04:17:51.838 --> 04:17:53.448
You do look and there are portions of the ground

04:17:53.448 --> 04:17:55.948
where you looking down you can see there are holes

04:17:55.948 --> 04:17:58.028
so there are there is some sort of a drain,

04:17:58.028 --> 04:17:59.551
a drainage feature built into the floors.

04:17:59.551 --> 04:18:00.405
TRAVIS: At least we're on the bottom.

04:18:00.405 --> 04:18:02.488
TALIESIN: Caleb, can you throw some light up to the roof?

04:18:02.488 --> 04:18:04.338
I want to just see.

04:18:04.338 --> 04:18:06.046
I got a funny feeling.

04:18:07.068 --> 04:18:07.901
MATT: Okay.

04:18:07.901 --> 04:18:09.192
MARISHA: Let's push some buttons.
MATT: What are you looking for?

04:18:09.192 --> 04:18:11.398
TALIESIN: Holes.

04:18:11.398 --> 04:18:12.231
MATT: You don't see anything,

04:18:12.231 --> 04:18:13.500
not matching the floor necessarily--

04:18:13.500 --> 04:18:15.458
TALIESIN: I mean, like, is there any-- is this ceiling

04:18:16.298 --> 04:18:19.148
like a solid structure or is it like, does it--

04:18:19.148 --> 04:18:22.168
MATT: I mean, it's solid except for the recess in the center

04:18:22.168 --> 04:18:25.181
which is where all the partially destroyed glass tubes are.

04:18:26.151 --> 04:18:30.342
ASHLEY: So do those-- do the tubes--

04:18:30.342 --> 04:18:31.925
let me see if I can try to explain this.

04:18:31.925 --> 04:18:33.898
The tubes that are in the room that we're in,

04:18:33.898 --> 04:18:36.301
do they connect to the ones that are outside?

04:18:37.508 --> 04:18:39.668
MATT: There is possibility that
there is a continuation of them,

04:18:39.668 --> 04:18:41.778
but you've seen multiple tubes

04:18:41.778 --> 04:18:43.468
and some that are severed and just dangling

04:18:43.468 --> 04:18:45.328
a lot of it's just loose and damaged.

04:18:45.328 --> 04:18:48.238
But you see at least consistent installation

04:18:48.238 --> 04:18:49.388
of them throughout.

04:18:49.388 --> 04:18:50.869
TRAVIS: Let's do it, we have to push it.

04:18:50.869 --> 04:18:53.002
LAURA: Yeah, let's fucking push it.
TRAVIS: I don't think we want to be in here, right?

04:18:53.002 --> 04:18:54.025
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's just--

04:18:54.025 --> 04:18:56.008
SAM: There's two buttons, right, DM?

04:18:56.008 --> 04:18:58.958
MATT: It looks like there are two raised glyphs.

04:18:58.958 --> 04:19:00.638
SAM: And one says Emergency Flush,

04:19:00.638 --> 04:19:02.058
the other doesn't say anything.

04:19:02.058 --> 04:19:03.898
MARISHA: What if we get shut out while half--

04:19:03.898 --> 04:19:05.921
we're all on the other side.
LAURA: Exactly.

04:19:05.921 --> 04:19:07.378
MARISHA: Should some of us be on the inside?

04:19:07.378 --> 04:19:08.798
SAM: Everyone back up.

04:19:08.798 --> 04:19:10.581
LAURA: But how are we going to ba--
what are we going to back up to?

04:19:10.581 --> 04:19:12.718
TRAVIS: We're going out of the room or--?

04:19:12.718 --> 04:19:14.418
LAURA: No, because if we get stuck out of the room

04:19:14.418 --> 04:19:15.668
we're fucked too.

04:19:15.668 --> 04:19:17.268
ASHLEY: Some of us could stay in here.

04:19:18.496 --> 04:19:20.798
MARISHA: I think we should split, half in here

04:19:20.798 --> 04:19:23.768
and half on the other side of the door, just in case.

04:19:23.768 --> 04:19:25.709
TALIESIN: Weirdly terrible idea, but--

04:19:26.851 --> 04:19:27.684
TRAVIS: Boy.

04:19:27.684 --> 04:19:29.788
LAURA: I really hate it.
TRAVIS: That feels--

04:19:29.788 --> 04:19:31.158
LIAM: If we want to take a minute--

04:19:31.158 --> 04:19:33.001
MARISHA: I want to split the party so fucking bad.

04:19:33.001 --> 04:19:35.708
LIAM: I could put up the dome like I did for Gelidon.

04:19:35.708 --> 04:19:37.451
TRAVIS: Oh, and it would protect us

04:19:37.451 --> 04:19:38.933
if it fills with anything crazy?

04:19:38.933 --> 04:19:40.991
LIAM: M-m-m-m...

04:19:40.991 --> 04:19:42.674
TALIESIN: Maybe?

04:19:42.674 --> 04:19:44.728
LIAM: I plugged the bottom of a boat with it once.

04:19:44.728 --> 04:19:46.469
TRAVIS: You did.

04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:48.909
LAURA: Yeah, it's waterproof.

04:19:51.848 --> 04:19:52.768
TALIESIN: Is it acid proof?

04:19:52.768 --> 04:19:54.658
TRAVIS: It's a pretty good idea.

04:19:54.658 --> 04:19:56.334
TRAVIS: Veth, no, wait!

04:19:56.334 --> 04:19:57.167
Wait!

04:19:57.167 --> 04:19:59.238
LIAM: I'm doing it. I slap the book down on the ground

04:19:59.238 --> 04:20:00.848
and I start ritual casting.

04:20:00.848 --> 04:20:03.388
TRAVIS: It's like a diving bell.
LIAM: A dome.

04:20:03.388 --> 04:20:05.168
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

04:20:05.168 --> 04:20:06.498
MARISHA: On the inside or the outside?

04:20:06.498 --> 04:20:08.248
LIAM: Inside.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

04:20:08.248 --> 04:20:09.927
LAURA: Yeah, then we just sit in the dome.

04:20:09.927 --> 04:20:10.760
TRAVIS: I'll poke my head out of the door

04:20:10.760 --> 04:20:13.149
and just keep an eye out during those 10 minutes--

04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:14.388
TALIESIN: The dome's going to be where the buttons are?

04:20:14.388 --> 04:20:16.581
TRAVIS: Just sentry style.
MATT: Okay, cool.

04:20:16.581 --> 04:20:18.211
LIAM: Well, it's whatever we want.

04:20:18.211 --> 04:20:20.908
Veth could cast from within the dome.

04:20:20.908 --> 04:20:21.818
TALIESIN: Oh, well.
LIAM: With Mage Hand.

04:20:21.818 --> 04:20:23.208
MARISHA: Yeah, should be good.

04:20:23.208 --> 04:20:25.398
LIAM: Or we could put the dome on top.

04:20:25.398 --> 04:20:28.288
TALIESIN: Let's put the dome right next to the door.

04:20:28.288 --> 04:20:31.336
So if it opens we have access.

04:20:31.336 --> 04:20:33.403
LAURA: Yeah, yeah yeah.
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

04:20:33.403 --> 04:20:35.307
SAM: Just put the dome in the door.

04:20:35.307 --> 04:20:36.481
So the door can't close.

04:20:37.373 --> 04:20:39.058
LIAM: The door is closed.
TRAVIS: Emergency flush.

04:20:39.058 --> 04:20:40.528
LIAM: Oh, the other door.

04:20:40.528 --> 04:20:41.861
TALIESIN: Okay, this is a plan.

04:20:41.861 --> 04:20:43.648
LIAM: I cast the dome. Here we go.

04:20:43.648 --> 04:20:45.553
MATT: Okay, so you cast the dome?
MARISHA: Which button?

04:20:45.553 --> 04:20:47.208
MATT: Whereabouts are you casting it?

04:20:47.208 --> 04:20:50.548
LIAM: I'm going to put it as
close as I can get it to the door

04:20:50.548 --> 04:20:51.958
that we want to open.

04:20:51.958 --> 04:20:55.088
MATT: Okay, cool, so you're placing it opposite

04:20:55.088 --> 04:20:57.514
room center to the left, that area?

04:20:57.514 --> 04:20:59.014
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yes?

04:20:59.014 --> 04:21:00.319
MATT: I don't know like, I'm trying
to figure out whereabouts.

04:21:00.319 --> 04:21:01.657
LIAM: Well, I can't see inside your head.

04:21:01.657 --> 04:21:03.538
MATT: I understand, so where you entered--

04:21:03.538 --> 04:21:04.371
LIAM: Yeah.

04:21:04.371 --> 04:21:05.458
MATT: Then across the wall,

04:21:05.458 --> 04:21:08.068
and to the left is where that angled metal wall

04:21:08.068 --> 04:21:08.901
is with the sign.

04:21:08.901 --> 04:21:11.040
Are you putting it in the center
of the room on that side, then?

04:21:11.040 --> 04:21:13.068
LIAM: Yeah, close as I can get to that door

04:21:13.068 --> 04:21:15.741
that we wanted to go through a moment ago.

04:21:15.741 --> 04:21:17.058
LAURA: "Biological Weapons."

04:21:17.058 --> 04:21:18.549
MATT: You got it. Okay.

04:21:19.924 --> 04:21:21.958
Cool.
TALIESIN and LIAM: All right.

04:21:21.958 --> 04:21:24.538
MATT: You finish the creation
of the dome and you are settled within.

04:21:24.538 --> 04:21:25.782
TALIESIN: Let's do this.
LAURA: Okay.

04:21:25.782 --> 04:21:27.148
LIAM: All right, it's up to you.

04:21:27.148 --> 04:21:30.875
SAM: Spectral hand appears and presses the other button.

04:21:30.875 --> 04:21:32.738
The <i>not</i> flush button.

04:21:32.738 --> 04:21:36.538
MATT: Okay, the hand presses on it, it doesn't depress.

04:21:36.538 --> 04:21:37.788
It doesn't like lower in.

04:21:38.934 --> 04:21:40.268
And it doesn't seem to react.

04:21:40.268 --> 04:21:41.738
LAURA: Oh, it may need, like, people.

04:21:41.738 --> 04:21:42.809
MARISHA: Fuck.

04:21:42.809 --> 04:21:44.378
SAM: I go over there.

04:21:44.378 --> 04:21:46.068
I'll sit on it.

04:21:46.068 --> 04:21:47.284
MATT: You sit on it.

04:21:48.228 --> 04:21:49.061
Nothing.

04:21:49.061 --> 04:21:51.548
TRAVIS: You've got spells Veth, go for it, come on.

04:21:51.548 --> 04:21:53.238
SAM: It needs a spell, what kind of a spell

04:21:53.238 --> 04:21:54.295
do you think it needs?

04:21:54.295 --> 04:21:55.441
TRAVIS: Abjuration?

04:21:55.441 --> 04:21:56.608
SAM: I don't have that shit.

04:21:56.608 --> 04:21:58.517
TRAVIS: I'll run over and be like: I'll try it.

04:21:58.517 --> 04:22:01.261
And I'll cast Armor of Agathys at 1st-level.

04:22:03.208 --> 04:22:04.578
MATT: Just at it?

04:22:04.578 --> 04:22:08.091
TRAVIS: Well, that's what we
did with the door the first time.

04:22:08.091 --> 04:22:09.728
Yeah, it was like touching the stone and--

04:22:09.728 --> 04:22:11.638
TALIESIN: Maybe if we get back in and then try and hit--

04:22:11.638 --> 04:22:13.058
MATT: You reach out and touch the stone

04:22:13.058 --> 04:22:15.008
and the minute you touch it with your hand,

04:22:15.008 --> 04:22:18.194
you feel it glow and warm beneath your hand.

04:22:18.194 --> 04:22:20.994
MARISHA: Wait, what?
LAURA: You just need a hand, not a butt.

04:22:20.994 --> 04:22:22.658
MATT: Needed a hand--
SAM: Are you serious?

04:22:22.658 --> 04:22:23.491
MATT: Yep.

04:22:23.491 --> 04:22:26.471
SAM: My hand is like my butt in many ways.

04:22:28.249 --> 04:22:29.315
SAM: It's dirty.

04:22:29.315 --> 04:22:33.890
MATT: As it glows, the door next to you guys--

04:22:35.303 --> 04:22:37.018
(rumbling, chains moving)

04:22:37.018 --> 04:22:39.467
begins to rise, as the door behind you

04:22:39.467 --> 04:22:44.467
slams shut and leans once more off of its mooring

04:22:44.640 --> 04:22:46.068
so that door is damaged

04:22:46.068 --> 04:22:47.808
and is back in its wedged position

04:22:47.808 --> 04:22:49.298
as it was when you found it.

04:22:49.298 --> 04:22:51.648
But locking you guys inside that side of the chamber.

04:22:51.648 --> 04:22:53.748
The other door opens and you're within the dome, right?

04:22:53.748 --> 04:22:55.357
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right, what are you guys doing?

04:22:55.357 --> 04:22:56.548
LAURA: Let's go.
MARISHA: Going through.

04:22:56.548 --> 04:22:58.256
LIAM: Nothing's pouring out or anything?

04:22:58.256 --> 04:23:00.248
MATT: Nothing's pouring out.
LIAM: Looks good.

04:23:00.248 --> 04:23:02.068
MATT: This hallway, too, is like 15 feet wide.

04:23:02.068 --> 04:23:03.018
It's the same as the previous one.

04:23:03.018 --> 04:23:05.208
LAURA: Okay, then yeah, we're gonna go down that hallway.

04:23:05.208 --> 04:23:06.688
MATT: All right, cool.

04:23:06.688 --> 04:23:09.530
Dome disappears, you guys take a few steps and you hear--

04:23:09.530 --> 04:23:11.322
LAURA: Uh-oh.

04:23:11.322 --> 04:23:14.371
MATT: (low mournful wail)

04:23:14.371 --> 04:23:15.381
SAM: It's a baby!

04:23:16.496 --> 04:23:19.702
MATT: (low whining)

04:23:19.702 --> 04:23:20.535
LAURA: Oh, I hate that sound.

04:23:20.535 --> 04:23:22.619
MARISHA: It <i>is</i> like a lower pitched baby.

04:23:22.619 --> 04:23:23.951
It's an old baby.

04:23:23.951 --> 04:23:25.445
MATT: (low whining continues)

04:23:25.445 --> 04:23:27.351
LAURA: Oh no. Oh no.

04:23:27.351 --> 04:23:29.398
MARISHA: Let's go-- should we back into the dome?

04:23:29.398 --> 04:23:30.380
Just scooch back?

04:23:30.380 --> 04:23:31.213
LIAM: I just dropped that.

04:23:31.213 --> 04:23:32.339
MARISHA: Oh, you just dropped the dome.

04:23:32.339 --> 04:23:34.998
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

04:23:34.998 --> 04:23:36.973
MATT: Hmm?
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

04:23:36.973 --> 04:23:38.081
MATT: You Invoke Duplicity.

04:23:38.081 --> 04:23:39.528
TRAVIS: I summon the sword.

04:23:39.528 --> 04:23:41.057
MATT: As you guys-- you hear,

04:23:41.057 --> 04:23:44.818
(pounding sounds)

04:23:44.818 --> 04:23:46.818
These heavy metallic footfalls

04:23:46.818 --> 04:23:49.458
heading from further down the hallway you're looking

04:23:49.458 --> 04:23:52.685
and you see this faint light swing

04:23:52.685 --> 04:23:53.868
side to side.
LAURA: Oh no.

04:23:53.868 --> 04:23:55.028
TALIESIN: Oh, for god's sake.

04:23:55.028 --> 04:23:56.628
MATT: What do you do?

04:23:56.628 --> 04:23:58.001
MARISHA: It's an angler fish.

04:23:58.838 --> 04:24:00.632
TRAVIS: Yeah, we make friends with it.

04:24:00.632 --> 04:24:01.931
It needs a friend.

04:24:02.768 --> 04:24:04.979
MARISHA: Okay, hang on. Is it dark in here? Is it dark?

04:24:04.979 --> 04:24:06.268
MATT: There is no light in the room

04:24:06.268 --> 04:24:07.658
aside from what you guys have created.

04:24:07.658 --> 04:24:09.554
MARISHA: Kill your globules, kill them.

04:24:11.688 --> 04:24:13.370
MATT: Globules are gone, you cancel your light?

04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:14.203
TALIESIN: I'm out.

04:24:14.203 --> 04:24:16.198
SAM: I'm going to hide behind Yasha.

04:24:16.198 --> 04:24:18.818
MATT: Behind Yasha. Where are you guys arranged right now?

04:24:18.818 --> 04:24:22.335
Because you stepped about 10 feet
into the hall before this happened.

04:24:22.335 --> 04:24:24.468
TRAVIS: And is it just a hallway and there's a huge,

04:24:24.468 --> 04:24:26.318
there's a sound and light coming at us--

04:24:26.318 --> 04:24:28.418
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: -- in a closed hallway?

04:24:28.418 --> 04:24:29.251
MATT: Yeah.

04:24:29.251 --> 04:24:30.450
LAURA: Maybe we should back into the room?

04:24:30.450 --> 04:24:32.022
TALIESIN: Back in the room.
LAURA: Back into the room.

04:24:32.022 --> 04:24:33.809
LIAM: I can't see anything at the moment.

04:24:33.809 --> 04:24:35.948
MATT: All right, you guys all back into the middle hallway.

04:24:35.948 --> 04:24:37.058
You hear like--

04:24:37.058 --> 04:24:40.578
you step into like glass that breaks under your foot.

04:24:40.578 --> 04:24:42.908
Thankfully, nobody gashes their ankle,

04:24:42.908 --> 04:24:44.163
but as you back up into it,

04:24:44.163 --> 04:24:46.744
you see the light slightly swinging, you hear the--

04:24:46.744 --> 04:24:50.278
(sniffing)

04:24:50.278 --> 04:24:51.260
MARISHA: Shit.

04:24:51.260 --> 04:24:55.160
MATT: (low wailing)

04:24:55.160 --> 04:24:57.984
(low wailing)

04:24:57.984 --> 04:24:59.192
(growl)

04:24:59.192 --> 04:25:00.558
(pounding)

04:25:00.558 --> 04:25:02.998
The light begins to get faster as it heads towards you.

04:25:02.998 --> 04:25:04.158
You can see now light,

04:25:04.158 --> 04:25:06.298
it lighting up the walls as it approaches.

04:25:06.298 --> 04:25:07.508
MARISHA: Let's just keep dragging them out,

04:25:07.508 --> 04:25:08.568
let's not fight in the hall?

04:25:08.568 --> 04:25:09.993
TRAVIS: Back him out.
MARISHA: Back him out, back him out?

04:25:09.993 --> 04:25:10.975
SAM: I'm going to find a hiding spot

04:25:10.975 --> 04:25:14.018
and I'm going to Voltaic Bolt and get ready.

04:25:14.018 --> 04:25:15.246
MARISHA: Fine.

04:25:15.246 --> 04:25:17.781
I'm just going to slip to the backside of the door,

04:25:17.781 --> 04:25:20.189
like up against the wall.
LAURA: Hit him right as he's coming through!

04:25:20.189 --> 04:25:21.918
MATT: Okay, so you hide on the side.

04:25:21.918 --> 04:25:23.879
You all find-- I'll say for the purposes of this,

04:25:23.879 --> 04:25:25.678
I'm going to set up a map

04:25:25.678 --> 04:25:27.133
so you can tell me where you are.
LAURA: Okay.

04:25:27.133 --> 04:25:29.060
MARISHA: Oh, and then he's going to call it, isn't he?

04:25:29.060 --> 04:25:30.700
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, got to.

04:25:30.700 --> 04:25:34.008
TRAVIS: I mean, it could be really sad, you know, imagine.

04:25:34.008 --> 04:25:38.038
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe he's got a broken paw?

04:25:38.038 --> 04:25:40.198
SAM: This made-up map is sponsored by Dwarven Forge.

04:25:40.198 --> 04:25:42.428
Surprise that special dungeon master in your life

04:25:42.428 --> 04:25:44.695
this holiday season with Dwarven Forge gaming terrain.

04:25:44.695 --> 04:25:47.970
Go check all their amazing stuff out at dwarvenforge.com.

04:25:47.970 --> 04:25:49.461
TALIESIN: No.
MARISHA: Cool.

04:25:49.461 --> 04:25:50.294
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

04:25:50.294 --> 04:25:52.348
MATT: This is the hallway you guys are backing into.

04:25:52.348 --> 04:25:54.678
This is now the closed door that fell off its hinges.

04:25:54.678 --> 04:25:56.378
This is the chamber and this is the platform

04:25:56.378 --> 04:25:57.819
where you pressed the button.

04:25:57.819 --> 04:25:59.399
Where do you guys want to be placed?

04:25:59.399 --> 04:26:01.228
LAURA: Where's the button that we pressed?

04:26:01.228 --> 04:26:02.061
MATT: Over here.

04:26:02.061 --> 04:26:04.158
MARISHA: What was the hallway
that you said we were coming through?

04:26:04.158 --> 04:26:05.748
MATT: This is the hallway that it's coming down.

04:26:05.748 --> 04:26:07.228
You guys entered from here.

04:26:07.228 --> 04:26:08.061
LIAM: Yeah.

04:26:08.061 --> 04:26:10.212
MATT: And that was where you were headed
before you backed into this chamber.

04:26:10.212 --> 04:26:11.045
LAURA: Okay.

04:26:11.045 --> 04:26:14.358
MARISHA: So I'm going to just
get my back up against the wall

04:26:14.358 --> 04:26:17.928
like right here, just waiting for it to walk by me.

04:26:17.928 --> 04:26:20.458
MATT: Okay, Veth where are you hiding?

04:26:20.458 --> 04:26:24.668
SAM: Put me like behind a cage or something.

04:26:24.668 --> 04:26:29.128
MATT: Okay, you can do that easy enough right there, okay.

04:26:29.128 --> 04:26:31.548
SAM: Maybe I can fire through the bars or something.

04:26:31.548 --> 04:26:32.588
TALIESIN: I'm going to hide behind--

04:26:32.588 --> 04:26:34.719
MATT: It'd be a rough shot, you can try it. What's up?

04:26:34.719 --> 04:26:36.938
TALIESIN: I'm going to hide hide by the astrolabe

04:26:36.938 --> 04:26:38.335
on the other side.

04:26:38.335 --> 04:26:39.485
MATT: Over here?
TALIESIN: Yeah, right over there.

04:26:39.485 --> 04:26:43.026
LAURA: I'm going to put my duplicate across from Beau

04:26:43.026 --> 04:26:45.328
on the other side of the hallway.

04:26:45.328 --> 04:26:46.161
MATT: Okay.

04:26:46.161 --> 04:26:48.688
LAURA: And I'm going to actually run

04:26:48.688 --> 04:26:52.738
and hide right behind the button.

04:26:52.738 --> 04:26:53.571
MATT: Over here?

04:26:53.571 --> 04:26:54.529
LAURA: Yeah.

04:26:54.529 --> 04:26:57.061
MATT: You've got it, all righty, Yasha?

04:26:57.061 --> 04:27:00.908
ASHLEY: I'm going to hang out with Jester's duplicate

04:27:00.908 --> 04:27:02.788
hidden behind there just getting ready,

04:27:02.788 --> 04:27:04.878
like, right up against the wall.

04:27:04.878 --> 04:27:07.578
MATT: There is a lot of rock and rubble right there.

04:27:07.578 --> 04:27:09.678
So you got to move into the corner or place there,

04:27:09.678 --> 04:27:11.759
where do you want to go?

04:27:11.759 --> 04:27:13.548
ASHLEY: I've got to have my glasses.
MATT: It's all good.

04:27:13.548 --> 04:27:14.668
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:27:14.668 --> 04:27:16.048
SAM: Jester?

04:27:16.048 --> 04:27:19.008
Why are you watching
Home Shopping Network right now?

04:27:19.008 --> 04:27:20.920
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll just stay right there, that's fine.

04:27:20.920 --> 04:27:22.633
MATT: Okay, Fjord?

04:27:22.633 --> 04:27:24.278
TALIESIN: It won't work, it's a zirconium.

04:27:24.278 --> 04:27:26.078
You can't use it for a spell.

04:27:27.007 --> 04:27:28.486
LAURA: It's so pretty, though.
LIAM: I'm totally blind,

04:27:28.486 --> 04:27:30.628
and Caduceus said that he grabbed Caleb,

04:27:30.628 --> 04:27:32.808
so I'll be next to Caduceus.

04:27:32.808 --> 04:27:35.038
MATT: So he gets dragged off into this side here.

04:27:35.038 --> 04:27:36.250
TALIESIN: Yeah--
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

04:27:36.250 --> 04:27:37.491
TALIESIN: I'll put Caleb behind me.
TRAVIS: Yeah, good.

04:27:37.491 --> 04:27:41.549
LAURA: When we hit the button originally,
when Fjord touched the button,

04:27:41.549 --> 04:27:43.418
did it instantly react

04:27:43.418 --> 04:27:45.546
or how long did it take to react?

04:27:46.388 --> 04:27:48.568
MATT: Currently, half a second.

04:27:48.568 --> 04:27:49.952
TRAVIS: And it was as soon as my hand touched it.

04:27:49.952 --> 04:27:53.405
MATT: It was like (rumbling) and then (chains moving).

04:27:53.405 --> 04:27:54.938
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try--
TRAVIS: And which podium was it?

04:27:54.938 --> 04:27:56.296
LAURA: -- time it to where--
SAM: Did we Star Wars it?

04:27:56.296 --> 04:27:58.020
LAURA: -- as soon as it starts to come through,

04:27:58.020 --> 04:27:58.853
I'm going to touch the button.

04:27:58.853 --> 04:28:00.948
MARISHA: Right as he's running, drop it?
TRAVIS: The rancor?

04:28:00.948 --> 04:28:02.434
You're going to do the rancor?

04:28:02.434 --> 04:28:03.388
MATT: Okay, okay.

04:28:03.388 --> 04:28:05.720
TALIESIN: Going to rancor this.
TRAVIS: Which podium was it, by the way?

04:28:05.720 --> 04:28:07.403
LAURA: It's where I am, that's why
I'm standing right there, yeah.

04:28:07.403 --> 04:28:08.236
MATT: Okay.

04:28:08.236 --> 04:28:09.674
SAM: Do you want me do it with the hand or you're going to--

04:28:09.674 --> 04:28:11.228
you're on the button?
LAURA: I'm on the button.

04:28:11.228 --> 04:28:12.561
That's what I was, that's why--

04:28:12.561 --> 04:28:14.528
MATT: You guys all carefully wait and you hear the--

04:28:14.528 --> 04:28:17.868
(pounding)

04:28:17.868 --> 04:28:19.798
As it gets louder and louder, before eventually

04:28:19.798 --> 04:28:23.378
you see the light begin to fill the floor.

04:28:23.378 --> 04:28:28.298
As there is this dangling, swinging orb of light.

04:28:28.298 --> 04:28:31.098
You've watched-- especially from your edge-- both Yasha

04:28:31.098 --> 04:28:33.198
and Beauregard as it emerges,

04:28:33.198 --> 04:28:36.058
and from the light you see framed

04:28:36.058 --> 04:28:38.729
these, like, human arms reaching out.

04:28:40.098 --> 04:28:42.128
And two more human arms.

04:28:42.128 --> 04:28:46.368
And two more, clusters of human arms

04:28:46.368 --> 04:28:48.558
that seem to be reaching out from the sides

04:28:48.558 --> 04:28:51.841
of a large bulbous swollen head.

04:28:52.918 --> 04:28:55.388
You see these arms are reaching out

04:28:55.388 --> 04:28:58.028
like Predator tendrils to the sides.
LAURA: Oh no.

04:28:58.028 --> 04:28:59.005
LIAM: Sorry, nope.

04:28:59.005 --> 04:29:02.058
MATT: These white, pupil-less, glistening,

04:29:02.058 --> 04:29:06.128
bulging eyeballs protruding from the front of this gray face

04:29:06.128 --> 04:29:07.651
that the orb is floating from.

04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:10.619
(rumbles)

04:29:10.619 --> 04:29:11.761
(low whining)

04:29:11.761 --> 04:29:14.644
LAURA: Is it in the doorway, is it
in the doorway, is it in the doorway?

04:29:16.428 --> 04:29:20.894
MATT: Its massive mammoth-like body of thick hide--

04:29:20.894 --> 04:29:25.358
(pounding) -- begins to step inward.

04:29:25.358 --> 04:29:26.838
As its head turns slightly this way

04:29:26.838 --> 04:29:29.946
you can see the face: humanoid,

04:29:29.946 --> 04:29:32.521
but awfully cherub-like.

04:29:33.428 --> 04:29:35.718
Like a large--
TALIESIN: Oh no.

04:29:35.718 --> 04:29:39.748
MATT: -- pulsing, swollen baby face

04:29:39.748 --> 04:29:43.018
with over a half dozen arms emerging from the side

04:29:43.018 --> 04:29:44.463
as its mouth opens

04:29:45.488 --> 04:29:49.298
to split open jaw with hundreds of teeth

04:29:49.298 --> 04:29:52.908
filling the inside of its blackened mouth.

04:29:52.908 --> 04:29:54.561
They slightly twitch and turn.

04:29:55.929 --> 04:29:58.558
(low whine)

04:29:58.558 --> 04:30:00.241
And that's where we're going to leave off this week.

04:30:00.241 --> 04:30:01.074
(yelling)

04:30:01.074 --> 04:30:03.371
As we get to fight this thing.

04:30:03.371 --> 04:30:04.896
TRAVIS: What is that?!

04:30:06.289 --> 04:30:07.925
TRAVIS and LAURA: No!

04:30:07.925 --> 04:30:09.865
MATT: One of my favorite minis of all time.

04:30:09.865 --> 04:30:11.973
SAM: Put it down so I can see it on the--

04:30:11.973 --> 04:30:14.165
LAURA: No!
TRAVIS: Is this a real thing?

04:30:14.165 --> 04:30:15.878
Did you make this?

04:30:15.878 --> 04:30:17.693
MATT: No, this is actually from Kingdom Death.

04:30:17.693 --> 04:30:19.598
This is one of the things got me to buy it.

04:30:19.598 --> 04:30:22.021
ASHLEY: Wait, can you turn the camera
so we can see his little--?

04:30:22.021 --> 04:30:24.168
TRAVIS: Wait, are you with the--
MARISHA: There we go, there we go!

04:30:24.168 --> 04:30:26.422
(yelling)

04:30:26.422 --> 04:30:28.581
TRAVIS: Because you're the one that I touched, right?

04:30:28.581 --> 04:30:30.888
ASHLEY: That is terrifying.

04:30:30.888 --> 04:30:33.396
TALIESIN: Nope nope.
LIAM: This is the future liberals want.

04:30:33.396 --> 04:30:34.579
SAM: (laughs)

04:30:34.579 --> 04:30:36.698
MATT: So we're going to pick up from there,

04:30:36.698 --> 04:30:40.578
literally <i>right</i> there, next week.

04:30:40.578 --> 04:30:42.244
TRAVIS: Oh my god, you can't.

04:30:42.244 --> 04:30:44.401
You can, and you did.
LIAM: Aww, look at the big dumper butt!

04:30:44.401 --> 04:30:46.025
(laughter)

04:30:46.025 --> 04:30:47.368
It's going to poo like a baby.

04:30:47.368 --> 04:30:49.968
LAURA: Is it that-- is it that far out already?

04:30:49.968 --> 04:30:51.548
Is it that far into the room?

04:30:51.548 --> 04:30:53.748
MATT: It has-- it is emerging right now.

04:30:53.748 --> 04:30:55.778
I'd say, to give you the benefit of the doubt

04:30:55.778 --> 04:30:56.998
we'll say there.

04:30:56.998 --> 04:30:59.128
MARISHA: Yeah, I like this plan, though.

04:30:59.128 --> 04:31:00.038
Let's remember this plan.

04:31:00.038 --> 04:31:01.348
TRAVIS: It can go one of two ways.

04:31:01.348 --> 04:31:03.088
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

04:31:03.088 --> 04:31:05.258
TALIESIN: That is nowhere near the most horrifying thing

04:31:05.258 --> 04:31:06.288
I've seen come out of that game.

04:31:06.288 --> 04:31:07.146
LAURA: That's terrifying.

04:31:07.146 --> 04:31:09.648
MATT: I've wanted to bring this mini
into the game for so long.

04:31:09.648 --> 04:31:10.938
All right, thank you so much.

04:31:10.938 --> 04:31:12.678
We'll pick this up next week.

04:31:12.678 --> 04:31:13.888
Have a wonderful week.

04:31:13.888 --> 04:31:15.168
We love you very much, and,

04:31:15.168 --> 04:31:16.512
is it Thursday yet?

04:31:16.512 --> 04:31:17.512
Good night.

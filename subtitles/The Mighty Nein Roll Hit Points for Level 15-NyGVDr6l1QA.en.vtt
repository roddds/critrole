00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.950
Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.290
We forgot, before the end of the last episode,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.670
to do a leveling up session,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.960
because the Mighty Nein hit level 15

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.171
when they reached the city of Cognouza.

00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:12.059
(cheering)

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.540
So we're gonna go ahead and do that now,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.540
go around and roll some hit dice

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.450
and see what the next level's gonna be.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.283
Let's go ahead and start,

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:20.950
we'll start over here.
TRAVIS: Me?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.150
You seem at the ready, Travis.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.340
I'm gonna take a level in warlock,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.023
which will make me level twelve, so I roll a d8.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.410
That is a seven!

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.670
SAM: Wow.
MATT: Slick.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.730
Perfect for a warlock.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.100
That's nice.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.640
That goes to your rolled HP, right?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.738
That's real nice.

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.483
A level in warlock.

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:42.733
(laughing)

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:45.500
LAURA: Am I up, I'm up?
MATT: You're up, Laura.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
I'm gonna roll this pink dice for Jester.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.333
I roll a d8.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.540
No, I rolled a one!

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.373
Re-roll ones.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.470
Eight, go eight, eight.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:57.805
Two!

00:00:57.805 --> 00:00:58.638
Hey.

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:00.330
(laughing)

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.364
This dice is not playing tonight!

00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:04.633
Twice as good as one.

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:05.683
There you go.

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:06.635
Happened to me last time.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:09.310
It is, I rolled two twice in a row now.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.030
Sad. Sad.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.280
It's a shame, your completely useless character.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.113
Pretty much.

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:15.157
Nobody likes your character.

00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:16.310
(laughing)

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.143
Liam.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.220
Nothing I do here will get me past a hundred.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.331
A six!

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.206
(cheering)

00:01:23.207 --> 00:01:24.308
Still haven't passed a hundred.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.140
I think that's the least giving a shit

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.063
dice throw I've ever seen you do.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.360
That was like a Salt Bae toss.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.193
All right, Sam.

00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:36.400
Here's mine.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.233
Three.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.938
Three, all right.

00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:40.190
Better than Jester.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.023
Sure, sure.

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:42.004
LAURA: Thank you.
MATT: Sorry.

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:43.350
I'm going to do this one.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.210
You've moved past it.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.660
You can't do worse than me.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.700
Five!

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.913
There you go. Five.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.990
Working our way out.

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.429
Working our way.

00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:56.652
Four.

00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:57.485
Four.

00:01:58.332 --> 00:01:59.906
And?

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:01.287
It's gonna be over six, it's gonna be over six.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.640
We got three, we got four.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.570
MARISHA: It's a one.
MATT: Re-roll ones.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.220
It's okay, you're gonna get a big one.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.061
It's a five.

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:07.904
(cheering)

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:10.447
MATT: Respectable, respectable.
MARISHA: Not too bad. Okay.

00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:11.593
All right.

00:02:11.593 --> 00:02:16.100
With that being said, everyone will be arriving at level 15

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.339
when we pick up the episode at the arrival of Cognouza.

00:02:19.364 --> 00:02:20.073
See you then.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.718
(cheering)

00:02:21.718 --> 00:02:24.468
(dramatic music)

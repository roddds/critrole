MATT: Hello everyone,

00:00:01.393 --> 00:00:02.990
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.370
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.206
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.850
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.060
MATT: Just like that.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.190
We do have some announcements to get through

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.730
before we jump into our game tonight,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.430
beginning with our first sponsor, Skillshare.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.263
Sam.

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:19.600
SAM: This episode is sponsored by our friends at Skillshare,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.960
an online learning community with thousands

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
of inspiring classes for creative and curious people.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320
Skillshare offers classes designed for real life

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.040
and all the circumstances that come with it,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.770
including graphic design, creative writing, and music.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.940
With memberships starting as low

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.810
as $10 a month with an annual subscription,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.340
Skillshare is a great way to learn and explore classes

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.130
and unlock your creativity for social good.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.990
As a special offer for our audience,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.930
the first 1,000 Critters to join Skillshare

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.220

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.274

00:00:53.274 --> 00:00:55.281
skl.sh/CriticalRole01211

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:57.250
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.670
SAM: Maybe a bit.ly one next time.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.500
Will get-- (laughs)

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.840
Will get a free trial of premium membership.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.350
Now I was given a free trial,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.568
and I signed up for a class called

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:08.710
Caring for Your Houseplants,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.840
and I learned a lot.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.250
For instance, did you know

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.240
that your plants will grow healthier and fuller

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.620
if you talk to them?

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.820
Here, I'll demonstrate. (clears throat)

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.550
Oh, hello, Janelle.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.600
Your leaves are looking fantastic today,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.040
full and green.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.047
You know, you really brighten my day.

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:30.120
LAURA: (as Janelle the plant) Oh, why thank you, Sam.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.222
That new haircut ain't half bad either, cutie pie.

00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:35.773
SAM: Oh. (laughs)

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:37.810
Well, you noticed, Janelle?

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.240
LAURA: I sit at your desk all day.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510
Now I got something handsome to stare at.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.403
SAM: Oh, well then,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.480
if you're open to it,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.123
I could spend some more time tilling that soil.

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:52.680
LAURA: Oh, you want to repot me? (laughs)

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.680
We could pour a glass of worm compost tea and germinate.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.980
TRAVIS: (as Steve the fern) Janelle!

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.190
What the hell are you doing?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.261
LAURA: Steve!

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.437
I thought you were still at the office.

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:06.725
TRAVIS: Who is this grass-hole?

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:07.600
Is he... (gasps)

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.643
Is he mulching with you?

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:11.150
SAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Janelle, Janelle.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.980
What is this fern talking about?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.870
TRAVIS: This fern is her husband, you filthy hoser!

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.190
SAM: Dude, I had no idea.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.940
Really, I am so sorry.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.650
We were just--
TRAVIS: I know what you were doing.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.985
And now your salad days are over.

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.400
LAURA: Baby, please, he means nothing to me.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.512
He's small potatoes.

00:02:28.512 --> 00:02:30.297
He doesn't even photosynthesize.

00:02:30.297 --> 00:02:31.810
TRAVIS: That's it, you bastard.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.780
You're going to reap what you sow.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.430
I'm going to amend the soil with your dead body.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.280
You heard me.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.500
Get over here so I can...

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.891
Wait, what are you doing?

00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:44.611
Get your green thumb off my skin, you scumbag.

00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:45.694
Hey!
SAM: (shushing)

00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:49.844
TRAVIS: (dying plant mumbling)

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.090
SAM: So there.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.553
You just talk to plants.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.980
And that's, that's how it goes.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.903
So go check out Skillshare today, everybody.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.993
Yeah, that's it.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.180
LIAM: (as a plant) Sam, who the fuck is that on your desk?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.310
SAM: She means nothing to me.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.200
Back to you, Matt!

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.686
LIAM: Son of a bitch!
(laughter)

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:16.320
MATT: Ooh my!

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.421
Okay.
ASHLEY: Wow.

00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:23.040
(laughter)

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.333
MATT: Well played.

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:25.441
ASHLEY: That was a bit.

00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.120
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.476
We've...

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:33.220
(laughter)

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.473
(laughter)

00:03:37.473 --> 00:03:38.686
SAM: Ashley.

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.519
That was so much salt.

00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.900
MATT: That was, that was--

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.540
ASHLEY: I'm just curious how--

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.023
Where your brain went

00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:54.948
to think of that bit for this ad.

00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:59.980
SAM: To think of our fine sponsor, Skillshare,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.528
and then go A to B

00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:05.450
with me having a three-way sexual affair with a fern?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.120
(laughter)

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.869
I think it's a pretty natural connection.

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:11.993
(laughter)

00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:13.860
TRAVIS: Commercial makes sense to me.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.424
ASHLEY: It does, it does, now that you break it down.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.560
TALIESIN: Ow.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.690
MATT: On that note,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.607
I want to thank our second sponsor for the night,

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:26.093
Elder Scrolls Online.

00:04:26.093 --> 00:04:27.590
This episode is sponsored by our friends

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.350
at Bethesda and ZeniMax Online Studios

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.917
and their 2021 release,

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:32.950
The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.710
coming on June 1st for PC, Mac, and Stadia,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.640
and June 8th for Xbox One, Xbox Series X,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.600
PS4, and PS5.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.850
So ESO is the largest Elder Scrolls adventure

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.030
with over 18 million players.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.560
They have a year-long adventure coming out

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.280
that includes multiple DLCs

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.640
and a main chapter release.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.950
And this year's main chapter, Blackwood,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.500
uncovers the schemes of the Daedric prince Mehrunes Dagon,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.570
one of the inspirations for our bird's name, actually.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.000
800 years before the events of Elder Scrolls 4.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.300
The first DLC, Flames of Ambition, is out now.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.380
And their freeplay event lasts until April 13th

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.100
at www.ElderScrollsOnline.com/FreePlay.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.990
They also have a ton of great offers going on right now,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.990
which you can find all

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.930
at www.ElderScrollsOnline.com/Buy.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.731
We are excited to have a year-long collaboration with ESO

00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:24.140
and will be sharing more content updates along the way.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.100
Super stoked about that,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.260
and thank you guys so much for sponsoring.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.880
SAM: That was amazing, Matt.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.660
That was amazing.
MATT: Thank you.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.277
SAM: You squished five minutes
of copy into, like, 40 seconds.

00:05:33.277 --> 00:05:34.420
That was good.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.703
MATT: It's no plant fucking, but, you know, I do what I can.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:39.578
(laughter)

00:05:39.578 --> 00:05:42.269
Trying to make it worth it.

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:44.319
TRAVIS: Plant fucking, though.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.200
MATT: Indeed, Travis, indeed.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.460
And finally, a big thank you

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.410

So last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.430
after setting your affairs outside of Eiselcross

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.690
into a comfortable place,

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.830
you gathered yourselves

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.418
to make your way northward once more.
OFF-SCREEN: ♪ Makin' my way! ♪

00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:28.890
MATT: With a brief goodbye
to the Clays in the Blooming Grove,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.223
a vision and proving ground for Yasha

00:08:30.223 --> 00:08:35.223
a vision and proving ground for Yasha

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.440
in the name of the Storm Lord

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.440
in which you have fully embraced your mission currently

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.860
as an extension of his power

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.883
and have taken the Holy Avenger as your blade.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.780
You all transitioned yourselves northward

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.470
through the risky expanse of teleportation magic

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.100
to a land that seems iffy

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.400
when it comes to such transportation incantations

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.440
and arrived safely at the outpost of the Dynasty,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.420
where Essek awaited your arrival.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.760
After sharing some information

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.020
about the current circumstances

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.393
and the timeline that you are on,

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.260
you all convince Essek to come with you

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.640
as you had discussed previously,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.860
and make your way in a northwestern direction

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.670
towards the secret entrance

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.728
that you expect Lucien and the Tomb Takers
are heading towards,

00:09:26.728 --> 00:09:28.020
that Caduceus had uncovered

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.760
through a successful use of his Divine Intervention.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.423
So as you all have gathered your things,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.140
you begin to trek out from the outpost

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.370
into the cold, snow powder-covered expanse

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.328
that is Aeor's sunken ruin.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.660
You're trekking through the snow,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.380
crunching beneath your boots, everything at your side.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.580
You have a number of hours of travel.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.630
And even just a short distance out into it,

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.450
Essek looks back, and glancing at the horizon

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.880
towards the space you're headed.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.910
"We are kind of out in the open

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.230
"in a very clear day

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.840
"against the white of the snow.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.200
"If there is some way we could be a little more...

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.680
"not a beacon for dangerous creatures to find us.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.600
"I could try and give us a form

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.360
"like the rangers of the outpost,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.380
"with white cloaks to maybe blend in a bit,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.540
"unless you have some other things to help you?"

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.400
TRAVIS: Alpine look?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.123
LAURA: I mean, I'm already wearing white.

00:10:36.123 --> 00:10:37.748
But--
MATT: "Fair enough."

00:10:37.748 --> 00:10:40.823
LAURA: I understand if you want to
make everyone else do the same.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.103
TALIESIN: I'm all right with it.

00:10:43.103 --> 00:10:44.830
MATT: "Just wearing a lot of black against the white

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.119
"can be a bit eye-catching."
ASHLEY: Yes, I stand out quite a bit.

00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:49.940
TALIESIN: Both of us.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.550
ASHLEY: Yeah, I would take one.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.522
TRAVIS: Winter mode, activate.

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:57.370
TALIESIN: (whooshing)
MARISHA: Shing.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.469
TRAVIS: You're the one activating it, I can't.

00:11:00.469 --> 00:11:02.320
TALIESIN: I-- just made sounds, didn't we?

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.499
MATT: "You did, all of you."

00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:05.215
TRAVIS: And pose, hit a pose.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.906
MATT: "It takes a moment for me to cast the spell."

00:11:07.906 --> 00:11:09.720
LAURA: Okay, just say a little--

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.999
MATT: And right as you finish that,
he finishes casting the spell.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:13.747
MARISHA: Oh, we aren't-- Ah.

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:17.150
MATT: (laughs) You try and jump into your pose in time.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.750
But each of you then take on the attire,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.830
while still yourselves,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.100
the attire of the outpost rangers of the Kryn.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.870
You can see the light gray, leather armor

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.870
and the white, heavy furred cloaks and hoods over you

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.610
that drop behind and, for the most part,

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.032
allow you, visually, an easier way to blend in

00:11:36.032 --> 00:11:38.755
in the environment as you move forward.

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:40.740
LAURA: Essek, can you make mine look

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.130
like it has just a little bee,

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.727
like one teeny, little bee right here?

00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:46.777
MATT: "The spell is already spent. I can't make alterations.

00:11:46.777 --> 00:11:48.700
"I am sorry."
LAURA: (distressed noises)

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.533
Okay.

00:11:49.533 --> 00:11:52.060
SAM: Can you burn another spell slot to redo it?

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.590
MATT: "I certainly can."

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.882
LAURA: No, no, no, no.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.770
Don't do that, Essek.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.493
I don't want you to waste a spell.

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:02.950
Don't do it, just don't.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.751
TRAVIS: Jester, it could be life or death.

00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:07.325
You don't need to reverse psychology our ally.

00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:08.447
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:12:08.447 --> 00:12:12.980
(laughter)

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.180
LAURA: It's not very good.

00:12:15.274 --> 00:12:17.050
13.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.950
MATT: "No."

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.340
But he does mark that spell off there.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.173
All right.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.380
SAM: Where are we going?

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.977
TRAVIS: Oh, we're going to the entrance, yeah?

00:12:30.977 --> 00:12:33.230
SAM: The real, the main entrance?

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.158
LAURA: The secret entrance, the one that Lucien knows about.

00:12:36.158 --> 00:12:37.908
Speaking of Lucien...

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.460
TRAVIS: Oh, my thing?

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.720
LAURA: Yeah!
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.540
I (laughs) forgot about the mark

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.950
that he put on my chest.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.870
Wild, yes.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.692
This is my fault.

00:12:51.692 --> 00:12:52.940
(laughter)

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.773
I say that now.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.430
ASHLEY: You, Fjord or Travis?

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.615
TRAVIS: Both.

00:12:57.615 --> 00:12:59.300
(laughter)

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.950
Yes.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.150
We fought with Lucien.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.160
And when he struck me, there was a blood brand sigil

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.200
that seared itself onto my chest.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.210
And I have a feeling that it allows him to,

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.480
you know, might be able to see where I am

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.880
or at least know my location.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.380
I should probably try and get it removed.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.470
We tried.
LAURA: We tried, Essek.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.803
TRAVIS: But to no avail.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.283
LAURA: But you're so powerful.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.415
TRAVIS: You don't have to burn
another spell slot or anything.

00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:28.543
You don't have to.

00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:29.959
I don't want you to have to--

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:32.386
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
(laughter)

00:13:32.386 --> 00:13:34.240
LAURA: Can I give him advantage? (laughs)

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.050
MATT: You cannot, not with the last one. (laughs)

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.960
TRAVIS: 20.
LAURA: Oh.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.793
MATT: He goes...

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.600
"I would assume that perhaps these devices

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.980
"that you acquired would be enough,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.920
"but I do not also understand the ins and outs

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.170
"of strange blood magic

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.430
"like you say that they utilize.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.863
"Hemocraft is something a bit beyond my realm of expertise.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.210
"But I can certainly give it a shot."

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.640
LAURA: Can we pretend, I mean,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.920
if we try to remove our clothes,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.960
does it still look like we're...

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.150
Could I be completely naked

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.474
and still look like I'm wearing clothes?

00:14:08.474 --> 00:14:09.475
TALIESIN: It'd be very cold.

00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:10.990
LAURA: With the spell you just gave us?

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.823
MATT: "You could."

00:14:11.823 --> 00:14:12.767
TRAVIS: Why would you want to?

00:14:12.767 --> 00:14:14.880
LAURA: I'm just saying, can you even see...

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.824
Can we show Essek the brand?

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.285
TRAVIS: What, you mean this?

00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:21.673
LAURA: Yeah, but it still looks
like you're wearing a vest now.

00:14:21.673 --> 00:14:24.420
MATT: It does.
TRAVIS: Damn it.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.350
MATT: "I can see vaguely through the illusion,

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.190
"knowing that it is an illusion."

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.170
LAURA: Oh, okay, cool.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.283
TRAVIS: So I would not recommend you disrobing.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.973
LAURA: All right. (laughs)

00:14:35.973 --> 00:14:37.463
I can put my clothes back on.

00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:38.725
(laughter)

00:14:38.725 --> 00:14:41.197
SAM: Don't disrobe, don't.

00:14:41.197 --> 00:14:44.348
Don't. Don't do it.

00:14:44.348 --> 00:14:46.134
MATT: Man, Eiselcross got weird.

00:14:46.134 --> 00:14:47.840
(laughter)

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.440
As you're all walking,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.140
as this conversation is happening,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.740
he drifts over in your direction

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.920
and, glancing just past the barrier of the illusion,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.110
can see ever so faintly that the dull orange glow

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.670
of the sigil that's burned into your chest.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.450
He's going to attempt to Dispel Magic it.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.390
SAM: It's that easy?

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.440
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.563
LAURA: I can't Guidance him or anything, can I?

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.670
MATT: For that, you could.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.503
LAURA: Can I say?

00:15:15.503 --> 00:15:16.521
Because I was going to say, and then I was like,

00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:18.050
does that work on this?

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.960
MATT: It might.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.200
LAURA: I'm going to try to Guidance you.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.670
MATT: Okay, well the first one failed.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.100
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: And he goes,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.300
you watch as he waves his hands,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.850
and there's a little bit of that soft impact,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.370
like a warm wind just taps your chest.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.497
And he goes...

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:33.590
(frustrated grunt)

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.580
LAURA: Guidance.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.523
MATT: Okay, he's going to attempt it again.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.290
What'd you add?

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.220
LAURA: I mean, it's a d4.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.500
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.703
Oh, I'm rolling it.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.290
That didn't help.
LAURA: No.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.504
Oh no, Essek.

00:15:53.504 --> 00:15:56.921
MATT: He goes... (sighs)

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.080
"I could continue to try."
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.570
You've been most gracious.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.000
I'm sure, I'm sure it's no big deal.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Besides, we need you at semi-full strength now

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.560
for anything that may show up.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.670
If, for some reason, we encounter no sort

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.680
of trouble or dangers tonight,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.590
perhaps before we all rest,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.470
then maybe we can try again.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.303
MATT: "I understand.

00:16:19.303 --> 00:16:23.497
"I am just, if we are certain that this seal

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.700
"of hemocraft is protected by this magic,

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.400
"then there is no need to worry.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.730
"But if our whole idea is to--"

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.573
LAURA: Sneak?

00:16:35.573 --> 00:16:37.360
MATT: "To sneak from this individual

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.310
"and not be, well--"

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.200
LAURA: What kind of magic are you doing to try to break it?

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.240
MATT: "I'm attempting to dispel it.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.050
"And it is receptive, but I--

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.470
"Maybe it is indeed my lack of experience in hemocraft.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.320
"But I could attempt a more powerful--"

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.760
LAURA: I could try it again.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.870
I'm going to try it again.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.920
SAM: Guide yourself.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.938
LAURA: I can't guide myself.

00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:01.440
TALIESIN: I can guide you.
LAURA: Thank you.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.800
MATT: Okay, you're attempting to--?

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.950
LAURA: Should I try it-- I wish--

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.883
Can I ask Essek how powerful his dispel is?

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.882
What are you trying it at?

00:17:10.882 --> 00:17:12.470
Were you doing it at 3rd-level?

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.351
MATT: "I was doing it at a basic level, I'm certain of it."

00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:16.038
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try it one level up, then.

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:17.483
MATT: All right.
LAURA: See if that works.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.440
MATT: So 4th-level.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.520
LAURA: 4th-level Dispel with Guidance.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.353
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.780
LAURA: DC plus, okay, all right.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.790
SAM: Roll good.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.110
LAURA: I'm trying!

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.490
TRAVIS: It's only my life.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.090
LAURA: It's all of our lives, Fjord.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.190
TRAVIS: Yeah, but mostly mine.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.023
LAURA: But mostly yours.

00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:39.297
(gasps)

00:17:39.297 --> 00:17:40.922
N-n-n-nineteen!

00:17:40.922 --> 00:17:43.563
Plus a d4.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.980
That doesn't...

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.333
Four!

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.593
23 plus whatever my modifier is.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.008
MATT: Your modifier would be your wisdom modifier.

00:17:55.008 --> 00:17:57.640
LAURA: I mean, wait, plus DC...

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.756
What am I doing?
MATT: You're rolling d20.

00:17:58.756 --> 00:17:59.847
You're adding your wisdom modifier--

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:01.933
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: And whatever you rolled on the d4.

00:18:01.933 --> 00:18:03.330
LAURA: So plus five.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.883
So 24 plus five is 29.
SAM: Whoa.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.380
23 plus five.
MATT: 23 plus five, yeah.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.793
LAURA: 23 plus five is 28.
MATT: There we go.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.800
You feel that same impact like you did with Essek,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.040
but it's heavier and actually almost briefly winds you

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.060
as you feel that same burning, searing sensation

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.290
that you originally felt

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.080
when it burned into your flesh.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.080
You hear, just so faintly around him, this sizzling sound,

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.330
and you instinctually (gags)

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.410
feel your breath catch in your mouth.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.630
It almost hurts.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.950
You're ready to make a pain sound,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.930
but it doesn't really hurt.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.740
You just sensory recall the experience.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.050
Then it fades, and the light is gone.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.040
And you can sense whatever anchor

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.030
that brand held in your body dissipate.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.372
SAM: Mage Hand, slap him in the tit.

00:18:57.372 --> 00:18:59.150
(laughter)

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.286
TRAVIS: It's cold out here.
SAM: Sorry.

00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:03.130
TRAVIS: That's even worse.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.641
LAURA: Can you see? Is it gone?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:19:04.641 --> 00:19:06.766
LAURA: Are you sure? Can you see your chest?

00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:08.523
I can't see it.
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:11.286
MATT: "It's gone. You did well."

00:19:11.286 --> 00:19:13.000
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.230
Resume sneak.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.180
MATT: "Indeed."

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.121
I would like everybody to make

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.790
a group stealth check for me, please.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.830
TALIESIN: Are we doing this fancy, or are we--

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.490
MATT: Because you all have the white cloaks in this space,

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.045
everyone gets advantage.

00:19:24.045 --> 00:19:27.668
TRAVIS: Ah, good job, Essek.

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.957
ASHLEY: Ooh.
SAM: Terrible roll.

00:19:29.957 --> 00:19:30.790
MARISHA: Oh, yep.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.101
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:34.400
LIAM: Real bad.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.374
MATT: All righty, so starting with Fjord.

00:19:36.374 --> 00:19:38.200
TRAVIS: (sighs) Four.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.580
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.650
TRAVIS: Four.
MATT: Okay.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.210
TRAVIS: Four and a two.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.853
LAURA: So you got six.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.720
You don't get any plus on stealth?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.553
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.300
MATT: What'd you get, Jester?

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.874
LAURA: 14.

00:19:51.874 --> 00:19:53.324
MATT: Okay.

00:19:53.324 --> 00:19:54.560
LIAM: 13.
MATT: Okay.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.240
With advantage, all righty.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.060
SAM: 25.
MATT: All righty.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.215
ASHLEY: 20 total, not natural.

00:20:00.215 --> 00:20:02.730
MATT: Got it.
TALIESIN: 21, who knew?

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.280
MATT: Look at that.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.440
MARISHA: 18.
SAM: Hey.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.322
So we made up for it in the back end.

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:09.080
LAURA: Sort of. If--

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.600
Would we have an idea if we're shittily stealthed?

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.417
Or would we think we are?

00:20:13.417 --> 00:20:15.117
TRAVIS: (laughs) A question as old as time.

00:20:15.117 --> 00:20:17.500
MATT: (laughs)

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.341
You'll find out.

00:20:18.341 --> 00:20:19.520
TALIESIN: We're bad at this.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.705
TRAVIS: We had Pike for three and a half years.

00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:25.762
LAURA and TRAVIS: Clank, clank, clank, clank!

00:20:25.762 --> 00:20:26.612
ASHLEY: (shushing)

00:20:26.612 --> 00:20:28.862
Clank, clank, clank!
TRAVIS: Clank, clank, clank!

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.170
MATT: Hours of trudging across this

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:38.040
somewhat shifting, rough and rolling expanse

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.200
that is the icy plain above the ruins of Aeor,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.540
the occasional snow-dusted surface of jagged Aeorian ruins

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.760
peeking through and jutting outward,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.540
some looking like natural, bony fingers

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.100
of some massive creature that's long-since buried,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.730
the towers themselves curved or broken with time.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.120
Other parts look like some semblance

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.110
of a beautiful piece of art or a statue

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.900
that is just barely part of the head poking

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.580
through the glacier-like ice that has since built

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.151
and formed over the broken city beneath.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.580
Slowly following, Caduceus, of course,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.429
is the one with memory of the direction to keep on this.

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:22.630
Essek reminds you along this journey,

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.300
"We did send a group of rangers

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.610
"as well as this Dagon fellow

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.810
"that you brought to our attention

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.630
"in that direction to keep perimeter.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.893
"So keep an eye out.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.470
"We at least, in this guise, will not surprise them.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.360
LIAM: Have you yourself ever been this far out

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.710
or anywhere near where we're going?

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.740
MATT: "I have not been this far.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.710
"Most of our goings on stick close to the outpost,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.860
"both for a defensible purpose and,

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.770
"well, trying not to overlap

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.101
"with other, not-as-kind excavation efforts."

00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.693
But as you continue on for an hour,

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.453
two hours,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.073
three hours.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.780
LAURA: Should I scry on Lucien and the team?

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.528
SAM: We've talked about this before.

00:22:12.528 --> 00:22:16.890
Aren't we concerned that they can see back somehow?

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.120
Or--
LAURA: I don't know.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.953
But if...

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.360
Wouldn't this cancel out them being able to see back?

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.970
TALIESIN: I feel like it's poking the hornet's nest.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:25.803
I'm not sure.
LAURA: Yeah, but

00:22:25.803 --> 00:22:28.670
what if they're not even coming to this location?

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.960
What if they're not anywhere in the snow right now?

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.760
What if--
TRAVIS: They're already down there.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.610
LAURA: They're already down there.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.740
LIAM: I think at most they would know

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.970
that they were being peeked at.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.803
I don't think they're going

00:22:36.803 --> 00:22:39.450
to look back and find us.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.283
TRAVIS: Yeah, same.

00:22:40.283 --> 00:22:43.920
I don't think it has a huge--
SAM: You want to do it?

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.210
LAURA: What you think, yeah?

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.900
MARISHA: I'm here for it.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.733
I vote yes.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:48.566
TRAVIS: We can keep moving.

00:22:48.566 --> 00:22:49.430
You can hop on my back.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.913
LAURA: No, I can't. It's got to be a thing.

00:22:50.913 --> 00:22:52.688
I've got to take 10 minutes.

00:22:52.688 --> 00:22:55.569
TRAVIS: I know, I'll give you
a piggy back ride for 10 minutes.

00:22:55.569 --> 00:22:57.960
TALIESIN: That's really hard to do that
while getting a piggy back ride.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.793
It's hard to do that while

00:22:58.793 --> 00:22:59.626
giving a piggy back ride.
TRAVIS: I've been working out

00:22:59.626 --> 00:23:01.240
with Beau, okay?

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.073
MARISHA: It's true.
TALIESIN: Have you?

00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:05.040
TRAVIS: I'm incredibly impressive right now, yes.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.380
TALIESIN: Oh, I hadn't noticed, wow.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.580
TRAVIS: It's baggy clothing.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.640
MARISHA: Snow hiking builds your glutes and your calves.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.360
So it counts.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.903
LAURA: That is true.
ASHLEY: That's good.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.350
MARISHA: Yeah, I didn't want to say anything

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.400
because I didn't want to potentially cross the line.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.210
But yeah, I can tell.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.133
LAURA: I suppose I could be like...

00:23:24.133 --> 00:23:26.433
I think you could carry me, and I could do it.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.061
I just won't be aware of what's going on, right?

00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:30.890
TRAVIS: I'm going to get super winded. (laughs)

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.163
MATT: We can give it a shot.

00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:36.084
TALIESIN: Mad Max this.

00:23:36.084 --> 00:23:38.250
TRAVIS: Caduceus, help me.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.083
TALIESIN: No.

00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:41.116
MATT: Just the wolf from Sword in the Stone.

00:23:41.116 --> 00:23:43.050
(exaggerated panting)

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.071
TALIESIN: I feel like there's a
valuable lesson to be learned here.

00:23:45.071 --> 00:23:46.468
SAM: Use a spell.

00:23:46.468 --> 00:23:47.301
LIAM: It's a crazy idea.

00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:48.696
MARISHA: I need to take a 10-minute break.
LAURA: No, don't use a spell.

00:23:48.696 --> 00:23:51.070
SAM: I could use a spell and levitate you for 10 minutes,

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.751
and he can just pull you like a balloon.

00:23:55.751 --> 00:23:57.760
LAURA: Oh, like a scrying balloon.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.930
MARISHA: Like Inception?

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.968
LIAM: Oh, we could sit down for 10 minutes.

00:24:00.968 --> 00:24:02.570
LAURA: There's also that.
TALIESIN: Fuck you.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.870
MATT: You guys tell me what you want to do.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.163
I like all these ideas.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.790
LIAM: I like them all, too,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.410
but they expend your very valuable resources.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.153
And I think maybe we should just sit.

00:24:12.153 --> 00:24:13.290
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could sit.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.443
LAURA: Okay, sit.

00:24:16.927 --> 00:24:17.760
MATT: Okay.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.240
LAURA: I'll make a couple little snow dicks,

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.803
just to set up the ritual.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.860
Draw an eye, woo, to think of Lucien.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.670
Okay, and then I'll cast my spell.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.107
Hey-oh, Traveler, come help me.

00:24:32.107 --> 00:24:34.709
Let me know if he sees me before I get over there, though.

00:24:34.709 --> 00:24:36.621
Okay, thanks.
TALIESIN: Guidance.

00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:38.311
(laughter)

00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:39.973
LIAM: Did you say double dare?

00:24:39.973 --> 00:24:40.815
LAURA: I don't know what I said.

00:24:40.815 --> 00:24:42.883
LIAM: Help me before I'm on Double Dare.

00:24:42.883 --> 00:24:44.370
(laughter)

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.920
ASHLEY: Oh, man, Jester on Double Dare?

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.250
TALIESIN: I'd watch the fuck out of it.
MARISHA: That would be epic.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.928
LIAM: (like Jester) Oh yeah,
I hope I win that Toys"R"Us run.

00:24:52.928 --> 00:24:53.761
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:24:54.706 --> 00:24:56.790
MATT: What an era.
ASHLEY: Okay, sorry.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.740
TALIESIN: Guidance on that.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.040
LAURA: Oh, yeah, oh, that's so smart.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.183
I always forget.

00:25:03.253 --> 00:25:05.288
TALIESIN: These guns remember that.

00:25:05.288 --> 00:25:06.740
MARISHA: "These guns remember"?

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.864
MATT: Carving out a pocket in the snow,

00:25:07.864 --> 00:25:09.260
and as you guys are trudging through,

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.270
it's like thigh-deep at places.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.860
It can go from knee to thigh,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.590
so it's a physically taxing experience.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.820
LAURA: Oh, but when you're thigh deep,

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.950
you can just lean back and sit down,

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.100
and your legs are--
MATT: That's true.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.933
LAURA: It's really nice.

00:25:21.933 --> 00:25:25.960
MATT: So you just sit into it and relax and try to focus.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.380
As you close your eyes, you hear the voice in your ears.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.402
(as the Traveler) "It is mighty chilly here, isn't it?"

00:25:31.402 --> 00:25:33.175
LAURA: It's freezing cold.

00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:35.780
MATT: "Well, let's see if hopefully your quarry

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.175
"is someplace warmer."

00:25:37.175 --> 00:25:39.130
LAURA: Oh, and mm, like, okay.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.043
MATT: As your will expands outward,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.430
you feel the clouds above get dense with snow.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.140
And as you try and push through them,

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.920
you see a flash of red in your mind's eye,

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.550
and then you're shunted back consciously into your body.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.790
And you hear the echoing voice vanishing in your mind

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.273
of Artagan going,

00:26:09.517 --> 00:26:12.364
"Well, sorry, I tried, tried, tried."

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:15.500
LAURA: You know what?

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.850
I really should next time, if we try this again,

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.178
I should try to focus on something other than Lucien

00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:21.816
because I think he would know. You know what I mean?

00:26:21.816 --> 00:26:24.170
SAM: Oh yeah, like Otis or something.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.620
LAURA: Otis, he seems kind of dumb.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.440
Or I can focus on...

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.940
No, wait, Otis?

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.530
Which one's the dumb one?

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.652
Are any of them dumb?

00:26:32.652 --> 00:26:34.110
SAM: They're all dumb.
TALIESIN: They're all pretty dumb.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.253
LAURA: They're all jerks.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.613
Or I could focus on something they're carrying.

00:26:39.613 --> 00:26:43.110
I could focus on the bag of holding or something.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.943
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:26:43.943 --> 00:26:45.570
MARISHA: Oh, I miss our bag of holding.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.384
SAM: Make a note for next time.

00:26:47.384 --> 00:26:48.890
(thudding on table)

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.628
LAURA: Got it. (laughs)

00:26:51.628 --> 00:26:54.440
TRAVIS: Just tell Fjord, we'll remember.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.306
MATT: So you know, it's location and creature.

00:26:56.306 --> 00:26:57.742
LAURA: Just kidding.
MATT: Just so you know.

00:26:57.742 --> 00:26:58.837
LAURA: Really?
MATT: Yep.

00:26:58.837 --> 00:26:59.670
LAURA: How do, okay.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.210
MATT: Because then you have Locate Object

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.080
and other ways of getting yourself to an object.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.871
LAURA: Solid.
LIAM: Which is short range.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.203
MATT: All right.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.970
"Well, I take it, it was not a success?"

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.240
LAURA: It was not, Essek, it was not.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.790
MATT: "That is unfortunate.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.030
"Shall we continue?"

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.690
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.693
Perimeter check.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:24.900
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.513
LAURA: I knock--
TRAVIS: Somebody assist me.

00:27:26.513 --> 00:27:27.490
LAURA: I make the eye go away

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.590
and knock down things.
TRAVIS: You roll with me.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.423
TALIESIN: All righty.

00:27:31.346 --> 00:27:33.073
LAURA: (air puffing)

00:27:33.073 --> 00:27:34.698
TALIESIN: 21.

00:27:34.698 --> 00:27:37.023
TRAVIS: That's going to be better than this.

00:27:37.978 --> 00:27:39.894
17.
MATT: Okay.

00:27:39.894 --> 00:27:41.377
Glancing about around the space,

00:27:41.377 --> 00:27:44.837
you do see, a little bit to your west,

00:27:44.837 --> 00:27:46.537
not intersecting with the path you're taking,

00:27:46.537 --> 00:27:50.062
but what looks to be a dark-furred, larger,

00:27:50.062 --> 00:27:52.195
but what looks to be a dark-furred, larger,

00:27:52.195 --> 00:27:57.195
lumbering beast (heavy footsteps).

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.327
Walking opposite, parallel to your direction.

00:28:03.637 --> 00:28:06.577
But it doesn't seem to notice your presence at the moment.

00:28:06.577 --> 00:28:08.957
TALIESIN: Dark-furred, lumbering beast.

00:28:08.957 --> 00:28:11.010
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.
TALIESIN: Walking parallel to us.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.635
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Doesn't seem to notice our presence.

00:28:13.635 --> 00:28:14.593
MATT: (laughs)

00:28:14.593 --> 00:28:16.690
ASHLEY: Oh, that's good.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.523
TRAVIS: Should be good.

00:28:17.523 --> 00:28:20.567
ASHLEY: Is it just walking parallel
to us in a different direction?

00:28:20.567 --> 00:28:21.941
LAURA: Yeah, doesn't seem to notice, though.

00:28:21.941 --> 00:28:23.621
TRAVIS: Show me your best snowman.

00:28:23.621 --> 00:28:26.304
TALIESIN: Hmm?
TRAVIS: Show me your best snowman impression.

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.217
TALIESIN: I've only seen a few.

00:28:31.217 --> 00:28:33.007
I've only seen the ones you made anyway, with--

00:28:33.007 --> 00:28:35.677
TRAVIS: It's good. I think we'll be all right.

00:28:35.677 --> 00:28:38.177
LAURA: Hey, no, their faces looked better than that.

00:28:38.177 --> 00:28:39.077
TALIESIN: I'm trying to--

00:28:40.357 --> 00:28:42.237
LAURA: Smile, smile.

00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:43.375
There you go.

00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:45.793
(laughter)

00:28:45.793 --> 00:28:46.809
TRAVIS: (scared yell)

00:28:49.456 --> 00:28:50.714
All right, we keep going.

00:28:50.714 --> 00:28:53.375
(laughter)

00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:55.767
MATT: (as Essek) "I'm not going to lie."
MARISHA: You look like me.

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:58.517
MATT: "Traveling with you is not
quite what I was expecting."

00:28:59.937 --> 00:29:00.777
TALIESIN: We get that a lot.

00:29:00.777 --> 00:29:01.637
TRAVIS: We try to keep it light.

00:29:01.637 --> 00:29:02.785
It can get dark really fast.
SAM: We've been on the road

00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:04.347
for a long time.

00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:06.631
LIAM: Speaking of dumb, we are real dumb.

00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:09.527
MATT: "I am appreciating the levity."

00:29:09.527 --> 00:29:10.360
SAM: On we go.

00:29:11.627 --> 00:29:16.337
MATT: So continuing onward, you do not draw the attention

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:19.787
of what you recognize as you begin to make the distance,

00:29:19.787 --> 00:29:22.067
you can see more of the shape as the rest of the snow bank

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:24.357
that was between the two of you begins to

00:29:24.357 --> 00:29:26.527
no longer separate your vision from the body.

00:29:26.527 --> 00:29:27.360
It's a mammoth.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.264
In fact, a group of mammoths that were heading southward,

00:29:30.264 --> 00:29:32.617
which you know from-- well, you've taken the form

00:29:32.617 --> 00:29:34.520
a few times.
LAURA: (roaring)

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.652
LIAM: Babies.

00:29:35.652 --> 00:29:37.037
LAURA: (giggles)

00:29:37.037 --> 00:29:38.937
MATT: And eventually, as we push forward,

00:29:41.427 --> 00:29:44.667
Caduceus, you see some of the exposed,

00:29:44.667 --> 00:29:46.617
broken stone structures that are pushing up.

00:29:46.617 --> 00:29:50.417
You can see a small cliff-like drop-off

00:29:50.417 --> 00:29:52.777
that begins to reveal itself a little ways ahead

00:29:52.777 --> 00:29:55.347
from the raised impact outer lip

00:29:55.347 --> 00:29:57.397
of this giant circular structure.

00:29:57.397 --> 00:30:00.077
And you start having that sense memory.

00:30:00.077 --> 00:30:03.317
You begin to recognize some of the terrain

00:30:03.317 --> 00:30:06.267
and you gather that you're not too far

00:30:06.267 --> 00:30:08.647
from the location that the Wild Mother showed you

00:30:08.647 --> 00:30:10.497
not but a week or so beforehand.

00:30:10.497 --> 00:30:11.935
TALIESIN: We're very close.

00:30:13.007 --> 00:30:14.017
This is almost it.

00:30:14.017 --> 00:30:16.127
Are there tracks on the ground?

00:30:16.127 --> 00:30:17.857
Anything that's been here before?

00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:19.967
MATT: You can make a perception check or survival check.

00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:21.937
TALIESIN: I will make, just because I never--

00:30:21.937 --> 00:30:23.540
MATT: I'm sorry, perception or investigation.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.937
TALIESIN: I will definitely take perception.

00:30:24.937 --> 00:30:25.770
My god.

00:30:28.724 --> 00:30:31.877
(exhales deeply) 15.

00:30:31.877 --> 00:30:33.257
MATT: Can't really tell.

00:30:33.257 --> 00:30:34.387
I mean, there was recent snowfall

00:30:34.387 --> 00:30:36.437
across a lot of this region, so if there were any,

00:30:36.437 --> 00:30:38.597
they wouldn't be too recent.

00:30:38.597 --> 00:30:41.237
Anything that would be more than the previous night

00:30:41.237 --> 00:30:45.137
would likely have been covered by the fresh snow.

00:30:45.137 --> 00:30:46.272
So nothing catches your attention.

00:30:46.272 --> 00:30:47.822
TALIESIN: Mm, all right.

00:30:49.637 --> 00:30:51.827
We have any way of contacting the guards

00:30:51.827 --> 00:30:54.947
to let them know that we're almost here?

00:30:54.947 --> 00:30:57.467
MATT: "I can reach out to them, if you'd like?"

00:30:57.467 --> 00:30:59.207
SAM: The ones back at home base?

00:30:59.207 --> 00:31:01.337
TALIESIN: No, the ones that we're about to run into.

00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:02.170
LAURA: Dagon.

00:31:03.535 --> 00:31:04.702
Dagen.
SAM: Dagen?

00:31:05.769 --> 00:31:07.269
LAURA: Dagen.
TALIESIN: (whistles a bird call)

00:31:08.524 --> 00:31:11.767
MATT: "Would you like me to reach out to my ranger contact

00:31:11.767 --> 00:31:13.240
"or to Dagen, or shall you?"

00:31:14.297 --> 00:31:15.887
LAURA: Oh.

00:31:15.887 --> 00:31:17.447
I can do it!

00:31:17.447 --> 00:31:20.741
Oh, mm, you can do it.

00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:21.741
MATT: "Very well."

00:31:22.969 --> 00:31:24.087
And he closes his eyes for a second.

00:31:24.087 --> 00:31:25.947
You watch as he brings his hands together

00:31:25.947 --> 00:31:27.867
and seems to pluck from the central place,

00:31:27.867 --> 00:31:32.169
and as he does, this long thread of slightly waving,

00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:34.127
black-purple energy comes out

00:31:34.127 --> 00:31:35.917
into a thin line, and as he holds it there,

00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:40.617
he says, "My friends, the Mighty Nein and myself

00:31:40.617 --> 00:31:43.467
"are quickly arriving upon the entrance.

00:31:43.467 --> 00:31:46.227
"Please, make yourselves known shortly."

00:31:46.227 --> 00:31:49.307
And as he speaks, you can see the line wiggling,

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:52.087
like it's actually picking up a wave of his voice

00:31:52.087 --> 00:31:54.247
and transitioning it through his Sending spell.

00:31:54.247 --> 00:31:55.947
This is how he does it.
ASHLEY: Wow.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:58.047
MATT: Before he releases the tethers in the sides

00:31:58.047 --> 00:31:59.637
and they (whooshing) fade away

00:31:59.637 --> 00:32:01.947
like a spider thread in the wind.

00:32:01.947 --> 00:32:03.278
ASHLEY: I watch them.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.013
Wow!

00:32:06.197 --> 00:32:09.653
LIAM: Ours is like the mud road drifter version.

00:32:09.653 --> 00:32:10.987
(gruff rural accent) I got a bit of copper wire here.

00:32:10.987 --> 00:32:15.168
Hey, I got some Natty Lights, I'm headed your way.

00:32:15.168 --> 00:32:17.080
TRAVIS: (laughs) Natty Light!

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.967
(laughter)

00:32:18.967 --> 00:32:20.334
TRAVIS: 30 keys!

00:32:20.334 --> 00:32:23.498
MATT: Trucker mage is my favorite
archetype of D&amp;D character.

00:32:23.498 --> 00:32:25.312
(laughter)

00:32:25.312 --> 00:32:26.633
SAM: That's pretty good.

00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:28.857
LAURA: But you were doing Sending.
MATT: Arcane catheter.

00:32:28.857 --> 00:32:30.507
LAURA: You weren't doing Message, you were doing Sending?

00:32:30.507 --> 00:32:32.136
MATT: That was Sending.
LAURA: Okay.

00:32:32.136 --> 00:32:33.460
TALIESIN: (laughs)

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.287
I can't believe I caught that.

00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:36.120
Oh.

00:32:37.487 --> 00:32:38.377
MATT: "Very well.

00:32:38.377 --> 00:32:39.807
"Keep your eyes peeled.

00:32:39.807 --> 00:32:41.037
"There should be a notification."

00:32:41.037 --> 00:32:46.037
At that moment, you see, Caduceus, Beauregard, and Caleb,

00:32:46.807 --> 00:32:49.890
what looks to be some sort of projectile

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.237
(whooshing) fly up into the air

00:32:51.237 --> 00:32:53.277
in the direction you guys were traveling.

00:32:53.277 --> 00:32:55.457
It arcs upward and behind it you can see

00:32:55.457 --> 00:32:59.577
this almost red ribbon that's wiggling behind it.

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:04.577
A audio-less, quick visual flare-like cue.

00:33:05.077 --> 00:33:06.677
You all turn over and look that direction.

00:33:06.677 --> 00:33:10.408
Essek goes, "Ah, I believe these are our compatriots."

00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:13.647
You do notice that the arrow was thrown

00:33:13.647 --> 00:33:18.647
quite a ways past where this cliff face descends downward.

00:33:18.717 --> 00:33:20.237
As you all creep up to the edge,

00:33:20.237 --> 00:33:23.827
you can see it's like whatever impacted here

00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:27.287
to create this valley-like crater that is the ruin of Aeor,

00:33:27.287 --> 00:33:30.847
as the city crashed in, the stone on the outskirts of it

00:33:30.847 --> 00:33:34.107
splintered upward and that's where

00:33:34.107 --> 00:33:35.897
the edge of this cliff drops off.

00:33:35.897 --> 00:33:37.317
And as you glance towards the edge

00:33:37.317 --> 00:33:40.740
and see the rugged exterior of it,

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.507
it's a miniature mountain range created

00:33:43.507 --> 00:33:48.207
from that impact that comes to an abrupt and scraggly end.

00:33:48.207 --> 00:33:52.427
Probably about a good 85 to 100 feet

00:33:52.427 --> 00:33:55.220
to the closest base of it there.

00:34:00.072 --> 00:34:01.085
LAURA: Are we going down?
SAM: Do we have to go down

00:34:01.085 --> 00:34:02.527
to get there?

00:34:02.527 --> 00:34:03.985
MATT: "I would assume so.

00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:05.700
"I mean, you are the one who knows where the entrance is."

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.717
TALIESIN: Do we have to go down to get there?

00:34:06.717 --> 00:34:08.367
MATT: Yes, you do.
TALIESIN: Yeah, we have to go down.

00:34:08.367 --> 00:34:11.617
LIAM: And you're saying an 80-ish foot drop from the lip

00:34:11.617 --> 00:34:12.587
of this cliff face?
MATT: Correct.

00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:13.747
As you walk to the very edge,

00:34:13.747 --> 00:34:16.017
it's lifting up, and then you peer

00:34:16.017 --> 00:34:18.217
over the edge and see the drop-off before it hits

00:34:18.217 --> 00:34:19.277
some snow and ice.
LIAM: Sheer.

00:34:19.277 --> 00:34:20.297
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:20.297 --> 00:34:23.177
It's mostly sheer, but elements of it do stick out,

00:34:23.177 --> 00:34:27.120
but there's no other really platform-like places to stop.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.072
TRAVIS: Where are the stairs?

00:34:29.072 --> 00:34:30.807
MATT: Make a perception check.
TRAVIS: Yep, no, I'm not going to.

00:34:30.807 --> 00:34:31.907
MATT: Okay.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.437
LAURA: Do you think there's stairs?

00:34:34.437 --> 00:34:35.707
TRAVIS: No.

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:37.962
LAURA: I'm going to look for stairs.
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:34:37.962 --> 00:34:39.127
TALIESIN: Assist.

00:34:39.127 --> 00:34:40.587
MATT: Okay.

00:34:40.587 --> 00:34:42.337
SAM: If she can't find stairs,

00:34:42.337 --> 00:34:44.900
should we come up with a different option?

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.550
ASHLEY: We could also look for an elevator.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.953
SAM: (laughs) Sure, sure.
TALIESIN: 16.

00:34:47.953 --> 00:34:49.336
SAM: A dumbwaiter.
LAURA: (whispers) Nine.

00:34:49.336 --> 00:34:50.526
ASHLEY: A dumbwaiter.
SAM: Sure.

00:34:50.526 --> 00:34:51.359
MATT: 16?

00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:52.946
There are no stairs.
TALIESIN: Yeah, well, that's fair.

00:34:52.946 --> 00:34:53.996
LAURA: Mm.

00:34:55.037 --> 00:34:57.747
SAM: Should we climb down or Feather Fall down?

00:34:57.747 --> 00:34:59.752
LAURA: Or we can just-- (thumping)

00:34:59.752 --> 00:35:00.927
MARISHA: (grunts)

00:35:00.927 --> 00:35:02.397
MATT: You push Beau off the edge?

00:35:02.397 --> 00:35:03.230
SAM: Well, she'll be fine.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.148
LAURA: Slightly, so she can go and see, yeah. (laughs)

00:35:06.148 --> 00:35:07.605
TRAVIS: Double guns.

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:08.797
Double guns.

00:35:08.797 --> 00:35:09.630
How many people

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.277
can we Feather Fall?
LIAM: I got this from years of training!

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:16.707
SAM: Between Caleb and I, we could
Feather Fall all of us down.

00:35:16.707 --> 00:35:19.416
That takes a small spell.

00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:20.482
Or we could--
LAURA: If it's small.

00:35:20.482 --> 00:35:21.817
I can only get me and one other.

00:35:21.817 --> 00:35:24.497
I mean, or we can transform and get a few people down.

00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:25.554
TRAVIS: That's a bigger spell, though.

00:35:25.554 --> 00:35:26.387
SAM: That's a bigger spell.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:35:26.387 --> 00:35:27.220
MATT: "Hold on to that.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.027
"We have our means of drifting carefully.

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.177
"Or we could try to climb.

00:35:31.177 --> 00:35:32.767
"Well, you could try to climb.

00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:33.817
"I'll be fine."

00:35:33.817 --> 00:35:35.997
LIAM: Why don't you educate us?

00:35:35.997 --> 00:35:37.537
SAM: Oh, yeah, you can drift.

00:35:37.537 --> 00:35:38.520
MATT: "I can."

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.957
SAM and TRAVIS: Can you drift us?

00:35:39.957 --> 00:35:41.467
MATT: "By the same means you are discussing,

00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:42.647
"yes."
SAM: Oh, the Feather Fall.

00:35:42.647 --> 00:35:43.872
MATT: "Yes."
SAM: Yes, yes.

00:35:43.872 --> 00:35:45.087
Well, we could try to climb

00:35:45.087 --> 00:35:47.047
and save spells, and then if we fall,

00:35:47.047 --> 00:35:48.526
then we'll use Feather Fall.
LAURA: Ooh, good call.

00:35:48.526 --> 00:35:49.417
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

00:35:49.417 --> 00:35:50.929
ASHLEY: Let's do that.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a good warm-up.

00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:52.044
Get the blood moving.

00:35:52.044 --> 00:35:53.619
LAURA: I go over and start to hang off

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:55.991
the side and try to start climbing.

00:35:55.991 --> 00:35:57.257
MATT: All right.
SAM: Okay. But--

00:35:57.257 --> 00:35:58.091
TALIESIN: Do we want to--

00:35:58.091 --> 00:35:59.497
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, divvy it up.

00:35:59.497 --> 00:36:01.137
SAM: Split into two groups here.

00:36:01.137 --> 00:36:03.166
LAURA: I'm already going down.
SAM: Okay.

00:36:03.166 --> 00:36:04.107
That's one group.

00:36:04.107 --> 00:36:08.037
But-- so if someone in group one falls,

00:36:08.037 --> 00:36:10.417
all of group one has to fall.

00:36:10.417 --> 00:36:11.417
TRAVIS: Yeah, who's in group one?
ASHLEY: Why?

00:36:11.417 --> 00:36:14.007
SAM: So that I can use Feather Fall on all of us.

00:36:14.007 --> 00:36:15.897
Because otherwise I would just use it

00:36:15.897 --> 00:36:17.297
on the one who's falling, and then

00:36:17.297 --> 00:36:18.857
the rest would have to keep climbing.

00:36:18.857 --> 00:36:20.877
So if someone falls, everybody just drop.

00:36:20.877 --> 00:36:24.327
LIAM: Yeah. So, what's the-- the code word is important.

00:36:24.327 --> 00:36:26.977
What's the word that is yelled if it's let go?

00:36:26.977 --> 00:36:28.125
MARISHA: Let go.
LAURA: (screams)

00:36:28.125 --> 00:36:29.717
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I think, scream.

00:36:29.717 --> 00:36:30.790
LIAM: That's two different things.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.043
Let go or scream?

00:36:32.043 --> 00:36:32.993
TALIESIN: (fearful yelling)

00:36:32.993 --> 00:36:35.144
SAM: We'll say the word scream.

00:36:35.144 --> 00:36:36.242
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Scream, okay.

00:36:36.242 --> 00:36:37.404
LIAM: Scream.
ASHLEY: Scream, okay.

00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:40.547
Won't you know if we're not on the wall anymore?

00:36:40.547 --> 00:36:42.492
LAURA: This is really steep, you guys.

00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:44.679
TRAVIS: I start climbing down, too.

00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:46.037
LIAM: Essek, you're with us. Come.

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:47.850
For ease of us, the four of us.

00:36:48.807 --> 00:36:49.977
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll go.

00:36:49.977 --> 00:36:51.845
SAM: I'm going to climb as well.

00:36:51.845 --> 00:36:52.678
LAURA: All of us are going.

00:36:52.678 --> 00:36:54.847
MATT: So, are there two groups or is it--

00:36:54.847 --> 00:36:56.710
SAM: I guess we're just going to free-ball it.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.651
MATT: (laughs) Okay.
LIAM: No, no, this is a group.

00:36:58.651 --> 00:36:59.577
This is a group.

00:36:59.577 --> 00:37:01.687
I am taking care of you three.
ASHLEY: Foolproof plan.

00:37:01.687 --> 00:37:04.053
TALIESIN: And you've got us, here we go.

00:37:04.053 --> 00:37:05.830
MARISHA: Probably could've dropped
a rope to make this easier.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.267
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, fuck it.
TALIESIN: Ah, too late for that.

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:08.337
ASHLEY: That would've been a good idea.

00:37:08.337 --> 00:37:09.170
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.003
SAM: We'll be fine.

00:37:10.003 --> 00:37:10.836
LAURA: That way, we would lose the rope.

00:37:10.836 --> 00:37:12.585
We can't get it from the-- oh, well, you could.

00:37:12.585 --> 00:37:13.693
Okay, it's fine.

00:37:13.693 --> 00:37:15.037
MATT: So, if I could have the three of you

00:37:15.037 --> 00:37:16.967
make athletics checks for me, please.

00:37:16.967 --> 00:37:18.664
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Should go well.

00:37:18.664 --> 00:37:22.197
LAURA: (singing heroically)

00:37:22.197 --> 00:37:23.238
LAURA: 16!

00:37:23.238 --> 00:37:24.437
TRAVIS: Hey, 23.

00:37:24.437 --> 00:37:26.057
LIAM: 14.

00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:27.907
MATT: The three of you actually manage to find

00:37:27.907 --> 00:37:31.187
some decent hand and footholds as you continue down.

00:37:31.187 --> 00:37:32.897
Some areas are a bit slick and the rock tends

00:37:32.897 --> 00:37:34.347
to crumble a little bit in others,

00:37:34.347 --> 00:37:37.927
but you still manage to confidently find your way down.

00:37:37.927 --> 00:37:42.327
Partway in your descent, you have this shadow drift by

00:37:42.327 --> 00:37:44.627
as Essek just drifts over the edge

00:37:44.627 --> 00:37:47.987
and just glides down past you, like an elevator,

00:37:47.987 --> 00:37:49.787
and just looks over at you each

00:37:49.787 --> 00:37:52.287
as he slowly descends

00:37:52.287 --> 00:37:53.939
towards the bottom.
TRAVIS: Moral support wouldn't hurt.

00:37:53.939 --> 00:37:56.984
LIAM: Not going to lie, that is pretty cool.

00:37:56.984 --> 00:37:58.327
LAURA: Essek, can I jump on your back?

00:37:58.327 --> 00:37:59.537
MATT: "No."
LAURA: Okay.

00:37:59.537 --> 00:38:00.464
LIAM: (fading in and out) No.

00:38:00.464 --> 00:38:02.365
(laughter)

00:38:02.365 --> 00:38:03.198
TRAVIS: IndyCar?

00:38:03.198 --> 00:38:04.200
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: (race car noise)

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.037
MATT: Full Doppler Effect on the way down.

00:38:07.037 --> 00:38:08.884
(descending in pitch) I'm sorry, that will not work.

00:38:08.884 --> 00:38:10.187
SAM: (race car noise)

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:12.207
But you guys manage to climb down safely.

00:38:12.207 --> 00:38:14.550
The rest of you, if you're following thereafter,

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.287
athletics checks, please.

00:38:16.287 --> 00:38:19.757
MARISHA: I'm just going to do my cool dope monk shit

00:38:19.757 --> 00:38:21.927
and do what I did before, take the back of my gauntlet,

00:38:21.927 --> 00:38:24.390
slam it in and just glide down the wall.

00:38:25.647 --> 00:38:26.480
Slow Fall.

00:38:27.527 --> 00:38:30.044
MATT: Okay, so you're just taking Slow Fall of it?

00:38:32.667 --> 00:38:34.204
TRAVIS: Don't smile at us.

00:38:34.204 --> 00:38:35.513
Get out of here with that mess.

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:37.437
(laughter)

00:38:37.437 --> 00:38:39.595
ASHLEY: Look how beautiful she looks when she's falling.

00:38:39.595 --> 00:38:40.987
LAURA: (laughs)

00:38:40.987 --> 00:38:43.587
ASHLEY: So graceful, such ease.

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.217
MARISHA: Right into the feather bed, ah.

00:38:46.217 --> 00:38:47.480
TRAVIS: Derelicte.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.487
(laughter)

00:38:50.487 --> 00:38:52.337
MATT: What would be 28 points of bludgeoning damage,

00:38:52.337 --> 00:38:54.107
how much do you ignore?

00:38:54.107 --> 00:38:56.670
MARISHA: Far more than that.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.663
SAM: Gosh, you don't have to be a dick about it.

00:38:58.663 --> 00:39:00.909
(laughter)

00:39:00.909 --> 00:39:02.577
MARISHA: Five times 14.

00:39:02.577 --> 00:39:03.410
MATT: Five times 14?

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.317
MARISHA: Five times 14.

00:39:04.317 --> 00:39:05.644
MATT: Good to know.

00:39:05.644 --> 00:39:07.707
(laughter)

00:39:07.707 --> 00:39:10.937
SAM: I just have to make a bigger mountain next time.

00:39:10.937 --> 00:39:12.150
MATT: Worked last campaign.

00:39:13.635 --> 00:39:18.177
TRAVIS: Not much, roughly 45 to 50-foot.

00:39:18.177 --> 00:39:19.407
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:39:19.407 --> 00:39:20.367
I'm good.

00:39:20.367 --> 00:39:23.437
MATT: Yeah, you grind down your gauntlet to the side

00:39:23.437 --> 00:39:25.344
before eventually kicking off and then landing

00:39:25.344 --> 00:39:28.027
(thumping) into the snow below.

00:39:28.027 --> 00:39:29.367
The rest of you rolled?

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:30.587
SAM: 15.

00:39:30.587 --> 00:39:31.517
ASHLEY: 25.

00:39:31.517 --> 00:39:32.350
TALIESIN: 14.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.997
LIAM: This whole character was just to make up for the fish,

00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:35.847
wasn't it?
MARISHA: 100%.

00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:38.237
I will jump off every cliff safely,

00:39:38.237 --> 00:39:40.216
every time I get an opportunity.

00:39:40.216 --> 00:39:42.397
(laughter)

00:39:42.397 --> 00:39:43.230
MATT: Respect that.

00:39:44.167 --> 00:39:45.000
Okay.

00:39:45.877 --> 00:39:47.677
You all find yourselves at the base

00:39:47.677 --> 00:39:48.510
of this cliff.
SAM: Hey!

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.975
We saved a couple of spells!
LAURA: We did it!

00:39:50.975 --> 00:39:53.397
MATT: You did good.

00:39:53.397 --> 00:39:55.607
And you gather, glancing around,

00:39:55.607 --> 00:39:58.827
that it's maybe another 10 minute or so walk

00:39:58.827 --> 00:40:02.387
up along this crestline before you will come to the fold

00:40:02.387 --> 00:40:05.907
in the ice where the entrance you recall seeing would be.

00:40:05.907 --> 00:40:09.007
It's about this time that you see a handful of figures

00:40:09.007 --> 00:40:12.337
begin to poke up over this little, soft ridge.

00:40:12.337 --> 00:40:14.776
And you see one hand go up and go,

00:40:14.776 --> 00:40:15.868
(as Dagen) "Hey!"

00:40:15.868 --> 00:40:17.516
(gasping)
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast!

00:40:17.516 --> 00:40:18.567
Oh, just kidding.
SAM: Dagen!

00:40:18.567 --> 00:40:19.717
MARISHA: Dagen!
MATT: (impact sound)

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:22.437
(laughter)

00:40:22.437 --> 00:40:24.208
SAM: Oh, Dagen!
MARISHA: Not another NPC.

00:40:24.208 --> 00:40:25.437
LAURA: Yay, yay, yay!

00:40:25.437 --> 00:40:28.157
MATT: At this point, the illusion that Essek

00:40:28.157 --> 00:40:30.747
had placed upon you dissipates amongst the group,

00:40:30.747 --> 00:40:32.277
revealing your true selves, as you've made

00:40:32.277 --> 00:40:35.247
the journey past the white, open expanse.

00:40:35.247 --> 00:40:38.047
And as Essek begins to glide in that direction,

00:40:38.047 --> 00:40:40.217
the rest of the rangers that are immediately present,

00:40:40.217 --> 00:40:41.767
which is only four at the moment,

00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:44.587
begin to emerge to meet you partway.

00:40:44.587 --> 00:40:45.953
Do you come along with?

00:40:45.953 --> 00:40:46.919
LAURA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:40:46.919 --> 00:40:48.257
MATT: All right.

00:40:48.257 --> 00:40:50.522
As you approach, they all begin to gather,

00:40:50.522 --> 00:40:51.487
you see them all keeping their eyes

00:40:51.487 --> 00:40:56.342
on the line behind them, and Dagen comes forward.

00:40:56.342 --> 00:40:59.317
"(laughs) Well, it's real good to see y'all.

00:40:59.317 --> 00:41:00.150
"Everything going all right?

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.190
"No problems?"

00:41:02.547 --> 00:41:03.380
LAURA: All of the problems.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.827
SAM: No problems at all.
TALIESIN: I mean--

00:41:05.827 --> 00:41:07.201
MATT: "You? I can't imagine.

00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:08.259
"You managed to stay out of trouble

00:41:08.259 --> 00:41:11.756
"and not drag any sort of ire or attention, so well done."

00:41:11.756 --> 00:41:13.384
(laughter)

00:41:13.384 --> 00:41:14.577
(coughing)

00:41:14.577 --> 00:41:17.087
TRAVIS: Stiff sarcasm weren't so cold.

00:41:17.087 --> 00:41:18.777
MATT: "Look, I've only been with you for a few weeks

00:41:18.777 --> 00:41:20.997
"and you're already the most rambunctious pieces of shit

00:41:20.997 --> 00:41:22.890
"I ever traveled with. It's fantastic."

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.264
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Thank you.

00:41:24.264 --> 00:41:26.648
MARISHA: Rambunctious?
MATT: "Well, until these ones."

00:41:26.648 --> 00:41:27.847
And he points to the other guards

00:41:27.847 --> 00:41:30.777
and they laugh and go, "He's--"

00:41:30.777 --> 00:41:34.997
and Essek goes, "(shushes) He's a new hire, be respectful."

00:41:34.997 --> 00:41:36.410
LIAM: Oh, Dagen--
MATT: Dagen goes, "That's right,

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.457
"I'm a new hire, be respectful."

00:41:39.457 --> 00:41:42.033
LIAM: Sorry, I forgot, I brought you these Natty Lights.

00:41:42.033 --> 00:41:44.283
(laughter)

00:41:46.567 --> 00:41:48.144
LIAM: Stupid.

00:41:48.144 --> 00:41:49.397
(laughter)

00:41:49.397 --> 00:41:50.767
TRAVIS: No, canon.

00:41:50.767 --> 00:41:53.127
LIAM: Yeah, is now.
MATT: Uncommon magical item.

00:41:53.127 --> 00:41:56.777
(laughter)

00:41:59.115 --> 00:42:01.652
MARISHA: It's the Aeorian mountains on those cans.

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:03.546
SAM: Have you found the entrance?

00:42:03.546 --> 00:42:05.061
(laughter)

00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:06.094
MATT: (as Dagen) "Well--" And you see

00:42:06.094 --> 00:42:08.317
the head ranger of this troop begins to speak up,

00:42:08.317 --> 00:42:09.150
"There hasn't been--"

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.697
and Dagen comes around and says,

00:42:10.697 --> 00:42:13.597
"There hasn't really been much of a sighting beyond--"

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:15.077
and they both stop and look at each other

00:42:15.077 --> 00:42:17.277
and you can already see, there's a bit of

00:42:17.277 --> 00:42:19.740
competitive tension between these two figures in the group,

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.627
before Dagen grumbles and crosses his arms

00:42:22.627 --> 00:42:24.277
and the first figure gives a nod.

00:42:26.117 --> 00:42:28.117
"We've kept eyes around the space

00:42:28.117 --> 00:42:30.097
"and have seen nothing out of the ordinary

00:42:30.097 --> 00:42:33.577
"beyond the normal and expected denizens

00:42:33.577 --> 00:42:37.137
"of this Aeorian expanse in Eiselcross.

00:42:37.137 --> 00:42:39.857
"We've looked for the individuals, but nothing as of yet,

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:42.827
"at least unless they slipped our sight,

00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:44.277
"which I highly doubt."

00:42:44.277 --> 00:42:47.897
SAM: And did you venture into the space?

00:42:47.897 --> 00:42:49.187
MATT: "No.

00:42:49.187 --> 00:42:50.445
"We would not do that."

00:42:51.427 --> 00:42:53.007
TRAVIS: You would not?
SAM: I would have.

00:42:53.007 --> 00:42:55.659
LIAM: But seen the entrance?
TALIESIN: Insight check.

00:42:55.659 --> 00:42:56.677
MATT: Make an insight check, yeah.

00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:57.901
LAURA: Ooh.

00:42:57.901 --> 00:43:00.157
TALIESIN: (blowing raspberries)
LAURA: (laughs)

00:43:00.157 --> 00:43:01.506
TALIESIN: (Kermit-y voice) 13.
MATT: 13.

00:43:01.506 --> 00:43:03.373
TALIESIN: (Kermit-y voice) Yeah.

00:43:03.373 --> 00:43:04.214
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:43:05.098 --> 00:43:06.867
MATT: The person in charge, knows what he's talking about.

00:43:06.867 --> 00:43:08.615
TALIESIN: (Kermit-y voice) He seems like
he knows what he's talking about.

00:43:08.615 --> 00:43:10.436
(laughter)

00:43:10.436 --> 00:43:11.769
SAM: That's a good character.
TRAVIS: That character.

00:43:11.769 --> 00:43:12.745
MATT: Campaign three.

00:43:12.745 --> 00:43:14.068
TALIESIN: (Kermit-y voice) Campaign three, man.

00:43:14.068 --> 00:43:15.675
(laughter)

00:43:15.675 --> 00:43:17.424
TALIESIN: More Kermit.

00:43:17.424 --> 00:43:18.732
TRAVIS: (Miss Piggy squeal)

00:43:20.987 --> 00:43:24.257
MATT: The ranger addressing that question goes,

00:43:24.257 --> 00:43:27.217
"Our instructions were to keep a perimeter

00:43:27.217 --> 00:43:29.827
"widely around the entrance that you had mentioned,

00:43:29.827 --> 00:43:32.307
"but to actually traverse them,

00:43:32.307 --> 00:43:35.498
"we are not specialized in such...

00:43:36.599 --> 00:43:38.507
"dangerous arcana."

00:43:39.564 --> 00:43:43.242
And Dagen goes, "They're a bunch of wusses!"

00:43:44.259 --> 00:43:46.017
LAURA: Does that mean you want to come in with us, Dagen?

00:43:46.017 --> 00:43:46.850
MATT: "Hell no!

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.467
"I'm not paid enough for that."

00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:51.067
TRAVIS: You're just going to keep a lookout

00:43:51.067 --> 00:43:52.997
while we go inside and scope things out?

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.430
MATT: "It's what I'm good at."
TRAVIS: Good.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.782
MATT: "I hunt things, I keep an eye out,

00:43:55.782 --> 00:43:56.927
"and I get paid well for it."

00:43:56.927 --> 00:43:59.457
TRAVIS: You've been here a while, do you see, I don't know,

00:43:59.457 --> 00:44:02.330
ample opportunity for an ambush up here, topside?

00:44:04.155 --> 00:44:04.988
MATT: Looks around.

00:44:04.988 --> 00:44:08.168
"I see an ample opportunity for an ambush anywhere I go."

00:44:09.012 --> 00:44:10.354
TRAVIS: I like his optimism.

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:13.177
SAM: Is it a flat area?

00:44:13.177 --> 00:44:15.940
I mean, other than the cliff that's nearby.

00:44:16.837 --> 00:44:18.595
MATT: "Well, I mean, there's the--

00:44:19.639 --> 00:44:21.704
"What I think is the entrance you were talking about,

00:44:21.704 --> 00:44:23.407
"that's up against the cliff."

00:44:23.407 --> 00:44:25.697
SAM: Oh.
MATT: "At the base of it."

00:44:25.697 --> 00:44:27.467
SAM: Okay, that's something.

00:44:27.467 --> 00:44:28.737
LIAM: You have a keen eye.

00:44:28.737 --> 00:44:30.387
We are expecting this place

00:44:30.387 --> 00:44:34.297
to be undiscovered country as of yet.

00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:36.924
Does what you've seen bear that out?

00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:39.148
MATT: The head ranger goes,

00:44:39.148 --> 00:44:40.098
"We were unaware

00:44:40.098 --> 00:44:42.877
"of its location until it was given to us.

00:44:42.877 --> 00:44:46.197
"So, to that extent, undiscovered,

00:44:46.197 --> 00:44:49.347
"but you have discovered it, so thus,

00:44:49.347 --> 00:44:52.151
"by the nature of its definition,

00:44:52.151 --> 00:44:53.150
"it is now discovered."
SAM: All right.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.608
LAURA: Yeah, well.
TALIESIN: That's technically correct.

00:44:54.608 --> 00:44:55.727
TRAVIS: Is this like a star,

00:44:55.727 --> 00:44:57.830
so if we discover it, <i>we</i> give it a name?

00:44:58.777 --> 00:44:59.857
SAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: This entrance?

00:44:59.857 --> 00:45:02.583
LIAM: We certainly do, that's how that works.

00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:04.632
MATT: "That's right, Dagen's Door."

00:45:04.632 --> 00:45:06.538
SAM: (laughs)
LIAM: That's what it is.

00:45:06.538 --> 00:45:08.457
MARISHA: I don't hate it.
TALIESIN: I've actually got no problem.

00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:09.943
LAURA: It's actually kind of nice.

00:45:09.943 --> 00:45:11.307
SAM: Brenatto's Backdoor!

00:45:11.307 --> 00:45:12.737
Maybe?
LAURA: Ooh, well.

00:45:12.737 --> 00:45:14.121
TRAVIS: We'll have to find that one.

00:45:14.121 --> 00:45:16.581
(laughter)

00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:17.835
MARISHA: That's the exit strategy.

00:45:17.835 --> 00:45:18.908
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:45:18.908 --> 00:45:20.567
ASHLEY: Ayo!
TRAVIS: There we go.

00:45:20.567 --> 00:45:22.995
LIAM: That's not our passage to enter.

00:45:23.907 --> 00:45:26.607
TALIESIN: Saw it on its way and you just cut me off.

00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:28.357
TRAVIS: We should scope out the entrance,

00:45:28.357 --> 00:45:29.607
because we're just guessing until we see

00:45:29.607 --> 00:45:31.257
what the lay of the land is like.

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:34.667
LAURA: If we go up there, will you guys be able to--

00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:36.937
the guards that stay outside-- will you guys be able to

00:45:36.937 --> 00:45:38.237
cover our tracks and make it look like

00:45:38.237 --> 00:45:40.857
we haven't gone inside and nobody's been here?

00:45:40.857 --> 00:45:43.017
MATT: The head ranger goes, I think we ca--"

00:45:43.017 --> 00:45:45.077
and then Dagen goes, "All right, no, we got you."

00:45:45.077 --> 00:45:45.910
LAURA: Yeah, okay.
MATT: "No worries."

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.767
SAM: And will you be able to make contact with us,

00:45:48.767 --> 00:45:51.477
should someone arrive?

00:45:51.477 --> 00:45:53.130
You know, as a lookout does?

00:45:54.336 --> 00:45:55.967
MATT: He looks over towards the head ranger

00:45:55.967 --> 00:46:00.477
who says, "Um, we have a quiet means of doing so.

00:46:00.477 --> 00:46:02.640
"We've already shown that upon your arrival."

00:46:03.495 --> 00:46:04.610
LAURA: Well, yeah, but how are you going to

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.947
send an arrow into the entrance?

00:46:08.947 --> 00:46:11.017
TRAVIS: What she means is, if we're underground

00:46:11.017 --> 00:46:14.037
and you're topside, can you communicate via arcane means

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:16.150
to let us know that someone might be coming?

00:46:17.937 --> 00:46:20.437
MATT: They look at each other, back and forth.

00:46:24.107 --> 00:46:26.507
They all look at Essek and Essek goes--

00:46:29.931 --> 00:46:32.817
"(sighing)"

00:46:32.817 --> 00:46:36.347
And he leans over and you watch as he puts his hands out,

00:46:36.347 --> 00:46:38.097
a small chest-- (flames blazing)

00:46:38.097 --> 00:46:40.667
apparates on the ground, semi-translucent,

00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:43.107
like it's made of shimmering glass.

00:46:43.107 --> 00:46:46.437
And he plucks a finger up and you see it open,

00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:50.473
and as he pulls inside and pulls two stones from within.

00:46:50.473 --> 00:46:51.740
(gasping)

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.597
MARISHA: He's got the walkie-talkies.
MATT: And hands one over

00:46:53.597 --> 00:46:55.397
towards the head ranger and goes--

00:46:58.307 --> 00:47:00.185
"Take care of this," and hands it to Dagen--

00:47:00.185 --> 00:47:02.201
MATT: -- who goes, like--
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:47:02.201 --> 00:47:03.814
MATT: "Looks like someone just got promoted."

00:47:03.814 --> 00:47:05.954
TRAVIS: Oh boy!
ASHLEY: Oh shit!

00:47:05.954 --> 00:47:07.663
TRAVIS: In front of the whole team!

00:47:07.663 --> 00:47:08.656
Woo!
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:47:08.656 --> 00:47:10.156
TRAVIS: Hot, that's hot.

00:47:11.278 --> 00:47:12.517
MATT: The other head ranger just

00:47:12.517 --> 00:47:15.367
quietly bites his tongue.

00:47:15.367 --> 00:47:19.067
"We will let you know as soon as anything catches our eye."

00:47:19.067 --> 00:47:20.077
SAM: Thank you.

00:47:20.077 --> 00:47:20.910
TALIESIN: We appreciate that.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.857
And if possible, I wouldn't recommend

00:47:23.857 --> 00:47:25.887
getting in the eyeline of these guys.

00:47:25.887 --> 00:47:27.130
They're a lot.

00:47:28.517 --> 00:47:29.937
They're a lot for anybody.

00:47:29.937 --> 00:47:31.257
TRAVIS: Exactly right.

00:47:31.257 --> 00:47:33.847
TALIESIN: All of us are going in
and <i>we</i> feel underpowered.

00:47:33.847 --> 00:47:35.947
TRAVIS: An early warning system will help us,

00:47:35.947 --> 00:47:38.737
but up here, stay hidden.

00:47:38.737 --> 00:47:41.047
TALIESIN: At worst, we may ask you to figure out

00:47:41.047 --> 00:47:43.307
a way to bury this entrance.

00:47:43.307 --> 00:47:44.597
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to ask about that.

00:47:44.597 --> 00:47:46.249
We talked about that

00:47:46.249 --> 00:47:47.837
before, we said to do that.
TALIESIN: Do we have some extra--

00:47:47.837 --> 00:47:49.171
TRAVIS: We should look at the entrance.

00:47:49.171 --> 00:47:50.467
SAM: Yeah, let's go in and suss it out.

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.984
TALIESIN: Flutter Butter or something?

00:47:51.984 --> 00:47:52.817
SAM: Fluffernutter.

00:47:52.817 --> 00:47:53.817
It's patented.

00:47:53.817 --> 00:47:55.853
TALIESIN: Fudge a fugger.

00:47:55.853 --> 00:47:57.453
LAURA: Fluffernutter.
SAM: Fuddruckers.

00:47:57.453 --> 00:47:58.997
LIAM: Fuddruckers, yeah.

00:47:58.997 --> 00:48:00.637
TALIESIN: The blow-up stuff.
TRAVIS: I love Fuddruckers.

00:48:00.637 --> 00:48:02.244
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yep.

00:48:02.244 --> 00:48:04.454
Fuddruckers, the blow-up stuff.
TRAVIS: Buns are so good.

00:48:04.454 --> 00:48:05.619
LAURA: They're so salty.

00:48:05.619 --> 00:48:07.211
TALIESIN: I love Fuddruckers.
MARISHA: I know, right?

00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:09.927
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Let's find the entrance.

00:48:09.927 --> 00:48:12.297
MATT: So as the rangers begin to scatter

00:48:12.297 --> 00:48:13.577
and build a perimeter at that point,

00:48:13.577 --> 00:48:17.977
with the Sending Stone remaining within Essek's control

00:48:17.977 --> 00:48:22.331
and with Dagen as well, you begin to make your way--

00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:23.172
TRAVIS and LAURA: ♪ Making my way ♪

00:48:23.172 --> 00:48:24.297
MATT: There it is.

00:48:24.297 --> 00:48:25.471
You let me down, man.

00:48:25.471 --> 00:48:28.057
SAM: (laughs) I'm waiting for the more interesting ones now.

00:48:28.057 --> 00:48:29.754
MATT: Oh, he's evolved.

00:48:29.754 --> 00:48:31.270
(laughter)

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.107
TRAVIS: We don't play on easy anymore.

00:48:34.107 --> 00:48:36.517
We're down here slumming.

00:48:36.517 --> 00:48:37.407
SAM: Yep.

00:48:37.407 --> 00:48:38.277
MATT: All righty.

00:48:38.277 --> 00:48:42.097
SAM: Next time you say the word "shaking," just get ready.

00:48:42.097 --> 00:48:44.057
Just get ready.

00:48:44.057 --> 00:48:45.577
MATT: (sighs)

00:48:45.577 --> 00:48:47.527
Every group needs a Sam Riegel.

00:48:51.047 --> 00:48:52.470
Following Caduceus' lead,

00:48:54.427 --> 00:48:59.427
you head over towards what is, to you, the familiar space.

00:49:00.297 --> 00:49:04.727
Already around this craggy cliff face

00:49:04.727 --> 00:49:07.117
to where this entrance is, you can see elements

00:49:07.117 --> 00:49:09.477
of broken stairs and structures that peek out

00:49:09.477 --> 00:49:10.877
from under the white powder.

00:49:11.887 --> 00:49:13.997
Numerous shards of history, essentially,

00:49:13.997 --> 00:49:16.577
left a crumble and vaguely remind you

00:49:16.577 --> 00:49:18.977
of something once great that fell in this space.

00:49:19.837 --> 00:49:23.537
You can see the entire side of this,

00:49:23.537 --> 00:49:26.687
it looks like an ice mountain with bits

00:49:26.687 --> 00:49:29.827
of blackened stone and rock jutting out.

00:49:29.827 --> 00:49:33.004
It is not smooth by any means.

00:49:33.004 --> 00:49:34.947
It looks like it was punctured with heavy force

00:49:34.947 --> 00:49:36.797
and then frozen in time.

00:49:36.797 --> 00:49:38.647
And elements of it fold outward

00:49:38.647 --> 00:49:41.747
in these awkward angles, like there was

00:49:41.747 --> 00:49:44.077
a quake to shift any sort of rigid structure

00:49:44.077 --> 00:49:45.747
and then lock it into place.

00:49:45.747 --> 00:49:47.697
And as you get closer, you can see, some of these ridges

00:49:47.697 --> 00:49:51.537
extend like it's a heavily serrated cliff face.

00:49:51.537 --> 00:49:53.037
Some of them bend around themselves,

00:49:53.037 --> 00:49:56.977
causing pockets, areas where you can almost step into

00:49:56.977 --> 00:50:00.637
one of these small ridges in the cliff face and disappear

00:50:00.637 --> 00:50:04.381
around a corner before it comes to a close and ends.

00:50:04.381 --> 00:50:05.579
ASHLEY: Cool.

00:50:05.579 --> 00:50:08.137
MATT: And the one that you recognize

00:50:08.137 --> 00:50:10.737
is one of the heavier ones.

00:50:10.737 --> 00:50:13.627
And as you watch Caduceus step into this space

00:50:13.627 --> 00:50:15.177
and you come around the corner,

00:50:16.787 --> 00:50:21.787
you can see a very faint sliver of it, about two feet wide

00:50:22.267 --> 00:50:25.007
and about four and a half, five feet tall,

00:50:25.007 --> 00:50:29.257
that opens into the ice and deeply within

00:50:29.257 --> 00:50:30.707
where the light cannot touch.

00:50:31.777 --> 00:50:34.240
You know this to be what the Wild Mother showed you.

00:50:36.782 --> 00:50:38.647
TALIESIN: (exhaling deeply)

00:50:38.647 --> 00:50:39.597
Well, we're here.

00:50:40.697 --> 00:50:42.098
That's unsettling.

00:50:46.587 --> 00:50:48.510
MARISHA: Shall we peek in a little bit?

00:50:49.437 --> 00:50:51.537
Come back?
TALIESIN: Let's put some light up and--

00:50:53.257 --> 00:50:56.092
still feel itchy, like we're being watched.

00:50:57.157 --> 00:50:59.777
Just can't get it out of my skin.

00:50:59.777 --> 00:51:01.117
LIAM: We're about to poke around somewhere

00:51:01.117 --> 00:51:03.990
that nobody's poked in quite a long time.

00:51:05.037 --> 00:51:06.228
TALIESIN: I hope not.

00:51:07.227 --> 00:51:09.177
MARISHA: This whole place has bad vibes.

00:51:09.177 --> 00:51:10.130
TALIESIN: Bad vibes.

00:51:11.997 --> 00:51:13.047
Well.

00:51:13.047 --> 00:51:14.417
MATT: Speaking of bad vibes.

00:51:14.417 --> 00:51:15.467
SAM: Uh-oh.
MATT: Caduceus.

00:51:16.427 --> 00:51:19.657
As you're looking over the space, you

00:51:22.367 --> 00:51:24.925
think you hear something...

00:51:24.925 --> 00:51:28.897
shift behind you all.

00:51:28.897 --> 00:51:31.557
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull everybody into the--

00:51:31.557 --> 00:51:33.767
just going to quietly grab everyone and move them

00:51:33.767 --> 00:51:37.020
into the blackness and I'm going to
turn around and look out.

00:51:37.993 --> 00:51:41.312
MATT: Okay, the dark space, it's quite small.

00:51:41.312 --> 00:51:42.287
TALIESIN: Oh.
MATT: You can get in,

00:51:42.287 --> 00:51:44.797
it's about two feet wide and four and a half feet tall.

00:51:44.797 --> 00:51:48.037
So you can go in single file, if you'd like.

00:51:48.037 --> 00:51:50.157
TALIESIN: I'm just going to quietly turn around

00:51:50.157 --> 00:51:51.717
and point and see if I can see anything

00:51:51.717 --> 00:51:53.457
in that shifting, from where that shifting came.

00:51:53.457 --> 00:51:54.317
Did it come from above

00:51:54.317 --> 00:51:55.407
or did it come from--
LAURA: Did it come from--

00:51:55.407 --> 00:51:56.240
MARISHA: Yeah, where did it come from?

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.287
LAURA: Inside or outside?
MARISHA: Outside.

00:51:57.287 --> 00:51:58.764
MATT: It came from the outside.

00:51:58.764 --> 00:51:59.830
LAURA: Okay.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:00.837
MATT: Not from the inside.
LIAM: Behind us,

00:52:00.837 --> 00:52:01.977
from where we came from.

00:52:01.977 --> 00:52:03.787
MATT: Yeah, as you all are stepping into this space,

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:04.737
because right now it's just Caduceus

00:52:04.737 --> 00:52:06.194
in the crevasse and talking to you

00:52:06.194 --> 00:52:08.362
while you guys are on the outside of it.

00:52:08.362 --> 00:52:10.547
MARISHA: Every guard is dead.
MATT: But you hear the sound.

00:52:10.547 --> 00:52:11.901
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:12.734
LIAM: (sighing)

00:52:12.734 --> 00:52:14.527
MATT: Beauregard, as he gives you that expression

00:52:14.527 --> 00:52:18.417
and glances over, you and Caleb,

00:52:18.417 --> 00:52:20.167
you all look at each other.

00:52:23.197 --> 00:52:25.227
And right as you turn back towards the rest of the group

00:52:25.227 --> 00:52:27.817
that's right beside you, you see the white snow

00:52:27.817 --> 00:52:31.922
that fills the space, part of it begins to bow upward.

00:52:32.855 --> 00:52:35.310
LAURA: Oh, fucking hell.
MATT: And drift off the edges.

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:37.034
SAM: What?
LIAM: A security system.

00:52:37.034 --> 00:52:42.015
MATT: As a massive blue hand

00:52:43.148 --> 00:52:44.487
(whooshing) darts out of the snow

00:52:44.487 --> 00:52:46.320
and reaches forward.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.568
If you can roll a d6 for me.

00:52:48.568 --> 00:52:51.999
LAURA: A massive blue-- how big of a blue hand?

00:52:51.999 --> 00:52:52.832
TRAVIS: Five.

00:52:52.832 --> 00:52:54.412
MATT: Five.

00:52:54.412 --> 00:52:55.653
LAURA: (gasping)

00:52:55.653 --> 00:52:56.527
LIAM: Frost giant?

00:52:56.527 --> 00:52:57.407
ASHLEY: Like Cabin in the Woods?

00:52:57.407 --> 00:52:59.377
MATT: Make an athletics check

00:52:59.377 --> 00:53:00.210
for me, yes.
ASHLEY: Me?

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.197
Okay, okay.

00:53:01.197 --> 00:53:02.030
TRAVIS: Oh, I rolled to you?

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.863
I'm sorry.

00:53:04.438 --> 00:53:06.130
SAM: ♪ Roll to me ♪

00:53:07.997 --> 00:53:11.052
ASHLEY: Oh, that's not good.

00:53:11.052 --> 00:53:11.897
Okay, okay.

00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:13.604
TRAVIS: I only hope this is one thing.

00:53:14.987 --> 00:53:16.827
ASHLEY: 12 total.

00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:17.660
MATT: 12.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.837
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: Mm.

00:53:18.837 --> 00:53:20.227
MATT: You, without even noticing this,

00:53:20.227 --> 00:53:22.027
suddenly hear the sound of the shifting

00:53:22.027 --> 00:53:23.717
and this heavy-- (stone shifting)

00:53:23.717 --> 00:53:26.077
heavy movement behind you as you whip around to turn

00:53:26.077 --> 00:53:27.987
and you feel this impact from behind

00:53:27.987 --> 00:53:30.097
and suddenly your arms are restrained to your sides

00:53:30.097 --> 00:53:31.707
and you're lifted off the ground.

00:53:31.707 --> 00:53:35.727
The rest of you watch, as stepping out of a pocket

00:53:35.727 --> 00:53:37.987
of the earth here that you all were stepping over

00:53:37.987 --> 00:53:40.047
coming towards the entrance, what looks to be

00:53:40.047 --> 00:53:42.687
a massive humanoid, standing upwards

00:53:42.687 --> 00:53:47.317
around 20 or so feet tall, their flesh blue and white

00:53:47.317 --> 00:53:50.307
with white fur and armor, but you can see where the face is,

00:53:50.307 --> 00:53:52.507
the flesh is torn away halfway down,

00:53:52.507 --> 00:53:55.677
exposing its skull, the jaw itself partially unhinged,

00:53:55.677 --> 00:53:58.157
with bits of frozen viscera just dangling

00:53:58.157 --> 00:54:01.447
like red-purple icicles outside of the face.

00:54:01.447 --> 00:54:04.887
As it lands up-- (squealing)

00:54:04.887 --> 00:54:08.307
you see-- (stone shifting) as two more begin to rise

00:54:08.307 --> 00:54:09.337
out of the ground nearby.
(panicked yelling)

00:54:09.337 --> 00:54:10.475
I need you all to roll initiative.

00:54:10.475 --> 00:54:11.528
(panicked screaming)

00:54:11.528 --> 00:54:12.751
TRAVIS: Wait!

00:54:12.751 --> 00:54:14.587
No, more than one?!

00:54:14.587 --> 00:54:16.897
SAM: This combat is brought to you by Dwarven Forge,

nearly indestructible-- is that true?

00:54:27.617 --> 00:54:30.047
P.S., Don't read this aloud, but please tell Sam

00:54:30.047 --> 00:54:33.537
that we love him and wish he would call more.

00:54:33.537 --> 00:54:35.187
Hugs, DF.
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:54:35.187 --> 00:54:36.617
SAM: Delve into the Seacave of Secrets

00:54:36.617 --> 00:54:39.649
at bit.ly/dwarvenforgecr.

00:54:39.649 --> 00:54:41.957
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:54:41.957 --> 00:54:43.667
ASHLEY: You know when you have your die

00:54:43.667 --> 00:54:45.317
and you're like, this isn't going to roll well,

00:54:45.317 --> 00:54:46.526
and then it does roll shit.

00:54:46.526 --> 00:54:48.697
LAURA: It's like you instill it with that negative energy

00:54:48.697 --> 00:54:50.697
as you think it, so just don't use it.

00:54:50.697 --> 00:54:51.813
Anytime you feel that,

00:54:51.813 --> 00:54:52.847
don't do it.
ASHLEY: Don't do it?

00:54:52.847 --> 00:54:54.007
I know, I know.

00:54:54.007 --> 00:54:55.060
SAM: Well.
LAURA: Serious.

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:57.926
MATT: You all were gathered around this space.
LAURA: If you get that vibe, don't use it.

00:54:57.926 --> 00:54:58.925
LIAM: That is hogwash.

00:54:58.925 --> 00:54:59.975
[dramatic trumpets]

00:54:59.975 --> 00:55:01.660
ALL: (dramatic trumpets)

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.180
LIAM: You're a good actor, you're selling it,

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.946
but it's not real.
LAURA: It's the truth.

00:55:04.946 --> 00:55:06.256
Putting it in there.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.289
SAM: Maybe Yasha will be mind controlled
LAURA: Sometimes you'll be like, "Oh my god--"

00:55:08.289 --> 00:55:09.328
and attack us like normal.

00:55:09.328 --> 00:55:10.510
LAURA: "I'm getting really good feels on this one."

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:11.343
ASHLEY: Right from the get-go.

00:55:11.343 --> 00:55:16.314
LIAM: I'm really angry at dice, but that's nothing.

00:55:16.314 --> 00:55:17.555
SAM: (humming to music)

00:55:17.555 --> 00:55:18.388
LIAM: Oh!

00:55:18.388 --> 00:55:20.656
TRAVIS: Oh, they are!

00:55:20.656 --> 00:55:22.056
Yes!
MARISHA: Oh my god!

00:55:22.056 --> 00:55:22.991
TRAVIS: I've waited!

00:55:22.991 --> 00:55:26.809
MARISHA: Zombies.
TRAVIS: My whole D&amp;D life!

00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:28.500
MATT: Yasha, you are currently

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.633
being held by this fellow here.

00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:33.168
TRAVIS: I love Jotunheim.

00:55:33.168 --> 00:55:34.720
LIAM: Oh!
SAM: What is Jotunheim?

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.320
LIAM: He's on a Thor kick.

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.349
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Oh.

00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:38.550
LAURA: (laughs)

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:41.443
TRAVIS: Frost or storm giants. Storm giant would be the--

00:55:41.443 --> 00:55:42.276
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:55:42.276 --> 00:55:43.571
LAURA: So this is frost giants?

00:55:43.571 --> 00:55:45.234
TRAVIS: They're the apex.

00:55:45.234 --> 00:55:46.627
TALIESIN: Zombie frost giants.

00:55:46.627 --> 00:55:48.890
ASHLEY: The frost giants are my ancestors.

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:49.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.034
SAM: Ooh, that one's got Skeletor legs!

00:55:52.034 --> 00:55:52.867
LAURA: Whoa.

00:55:52.867 --> 00:55:53.700
TRAVIS: Wow!

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.152
LAURA: That's a full-on skeleton zombie.
TRAVIS: What!

00:55:55.152 --> 00:55:56.863
MATT: As they all begin to rise out,

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:01.380
you can suddenly feel the wave of necrotic energy

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.900
just emanate from the space below.

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.340
Your presence rousing them from some sort of slumber.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.553
Uncertain as to what called them up,

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.380
whether they died here and have risen,

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:14.840
or they were installed here as a defense, you are uncertain.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.560
All you know is shit's about to go down.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.350
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, in a big way. (laughs) Oh shit.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:22.260
MARISHA: Okay.

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.093
MATT: 25 to 20.

00:56:23.093 --> 00:56:24.588
LAURA: Oh, I haven't even rolled!

00:56:24.588 --> 00:56:26.080
MATT: Roll initiative!

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.921
SAM: Roll initiative!
TALIESIN: I forgot what I rolled.

00:56:27.921 --> 00:56:29.221
I literally forgot what I rolled.

00:56:29.221 --> 00:56:31.256
Okay, just shit.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.080
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody?

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.030
20 to 15?

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:38.590
ASHLEY: 17.

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.970
TRAVIS: Are you the top? You're the top.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:40.803
MARISHA: Wow.

00:56:43.021 --> 00:56:43.854
SAM: 16.

00:56:45.476 --> 00:56:46.534
MARISHA: 15.

00:56:49.333 --> 00:56:50.616
TRAVIS: We really could have done better.

00:56:50.616 --> 00:56:52.617
Really could have done better.
MARISHA: Yep, yep.

00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:54.173
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:56:54.173 --> 00:56:55.482
MATT: 15 to 10?

00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:57.224
TRAVIS: 13.
LAURA: 10.

00:56:57.224 --> 00:56:58.057
TRAVIS: Oh man.

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:02.537
LAURA: I didn't even write down the order.

00:57:02.537 --> 00:57:03.377
TRAVIS: I got it.

00:57:03.377 --> 00:57:04.752
MATT: Caduceus, Caleb?

00:57:04.752 --> 00:57:06.730
TALIESIN: Eight.
LIAM: Six.

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.051
MATT: All right.

00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:09.985
LIAM: Right where I like to be.

00:57:09.985 --> 00:57:11.870
MARISHA: Wait, what was that?
LIAM: At the bottom.

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.162
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: Oh, I missed it all.

00:57:13.162 --> 00:57:15.093
MATT: Yasha, you are up first.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:57:15.093 --> 00:57:19.270
MATT: You are currently grappled by this creature.

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.910
You are lifted up off the ground, your blade's not even

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:24.754
drawn and your arms are just held to your side.

00:57:24.754 --> 00:57:25.654
What are you going to do?

00:57:25.654 --> 00:57:29.331
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to rage.

00:57:29.331 --> 00:57:30.739
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: All right. Hell yeah.

00:57:30.739 --> 00:57:32.754
ASHLEY: Who fucking did it right? I did.

00:57:32.754 --> 00:57:36.660
(laughter)

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.873
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:40.530
Now what do I do?

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.450
Okay, so raging,

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:48.450
and I'm going to try to break the grapple.

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.730
MATT: Okay, well, the first thing I need you to do

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:53.485
is go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.

00:57:53.485 --> 00:57:54.790
LAURA: Oh no.

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:56.588
Oh no.
TRAVIS: Constitution.

00:57:56.588 --> 00:57:58.043
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.
TALIESIN: You get a bonus for that?

00:57:58.043 --> 00:57:59.651
ASHLEY: I'm feeling this one.

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:05.317
Ooh, okay. Natural 19, plus eight, 27.

00:58:05.317 --> 00:58:06.700
MARISHA: Oh!

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:07.533
MATT: Okay.

00:58:07.533 --> 00:58:09.660
Yeah, you sense in the proximity of it,

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.800
this skin that's touching you is freezing cold

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.610
and it would be cutting to your bones,

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.776
except for the fact that you are an awesome bitch.

00:58:17.776 --> 00:58:20.597
(laughter)

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:22.000
MATT: So what are you doing with the rest of your turn?

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.360
ASHLEY: Okay, so let me try to--

00:58:26.476 --> 00:58:28.270
I'm going to try to break the grapple.

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:31.213
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll an athletics check for me.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.590
Athletics or acrobatics, your choice.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:34.590
But I assume it's athletics

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:37.250
and you have advantage because you're raging.

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.860
TRAVIS: I can't stop looking at the map. I can't even think.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:40.693
ASHLEY: Okay, great.

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.520
26.

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.483
MATT: 26.

00:58:47.556 --> 00:58:49.820
You break free from its grasp,

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.370
immediately leaping back into the snow.

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:54.693
Right there, adjacent to it, off to its side.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.860
That is your action to break free,

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:01.240
but you are no longer being held by the entity.

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:07.107
ASHLEY: That's my turn.

00:59:07.107 --> 00:59:09.157
MATT: You draw your weapon?

00:59:09.157 --> 00:59:10.274
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:59:10.274 --> 00:59:12.320
ASHLEY: (laughs)

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.470
I draw my weapon.

00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:15.440
While I'm standing there, I take out the Holy Avenger,

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.220
because I'm getting ready to use it for the first time!

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.800
MATT: You got it, you got it. All right!

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.716
That finishes your go, Yasha.

00:59:21.716 --> 00:59:23.980
Veth, you are up. Beauregard, you are on deck.

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:26.830
SAM: I assume that this giant has reached down

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.790
to get Yasha, right?

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.170
MATT: It grabbed her first. A hand came out from underneath,

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:35.100
and then it stood up and lifted her up with it.

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:35.993
So just now

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:38.960
got up mostly onto its feet

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.613
before she burst out of its hand to the side.

00:59:40.613 --> 00:59:45.010
SAM: Is its hand close-ish to her height, to the ground-ish?

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:47.030
MATT: I'd say it's three or four feet from her, yeah.

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:50.520
SAM: Okay, only because this is the only time

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.730
I'm ever going to get a chance to do this.

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:56.720
I'm going to do the move from our animated opening

00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.620
where in the opening it's Nott,

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.940
but she runs up a giant's arm

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.540
and shoots a giant in the head as she goes.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.787
MATT: You want to do it? You want to do it?

01:00:06.787 --> 01:00:08.930
SAM: I'm just going to do that exact move.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.556
MATT: Let's give it a shot.

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:11.890
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.676
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me.

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.910
ASHLEY: Come on.
MARISHA: Make it true!

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:16.856
SAM: Two.

01:00:16.856 --> 01:00:19.160
(laughter)
But, but!

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.727
But I believe I get an automatic 10 on acrobatics.

01:00:21.727 --> 01:00:22.560
MATT: You do.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.300
SAM: Plus a plus-10, so my lowest acrobatics roll is 20.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.490
MATT: Which is more than enough.

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.810
So after Yasha breaks out of its grasp

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:34.720
and it stumbles for a second. It begins to pull back.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.720
You dart around, leap onto its hand and then, (footsteps)

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.185
running up its shoulder, jump off of it?

01:00:40.185 --> 01:00:41.210
SAM: She shoots him in the head

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.907
and she goes past its head or something?

01:00:42.907 --> 01:00:44.340
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and make the attack.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:48.344
As you are currently running up its arm and onto its back.

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:49.935
LAURA: Aw, I love when she does this!

01:00:49.935 --> 01:00:51.344
SAM: A 19.

01:00:51.344 --> 01:00:55.170
A 19 plus 11. 30 to hit!

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:57.023
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:00:57.023 --> 01:00:58.396
SAM: Do I get sneak attack?

01:00:58.396 --> 01:01:00.115
MATT: Yes, you do.
SAM: Because it's engaged with Yasha?

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:00.948
Yeah.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.488
Oh, yeah. Okay, good.

01:01:04.488 --> 01:01:05.695
MATT: Now I need you to make

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.870
a constitution saving throw for me as well.

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:09.343
SAM: Okay. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.970
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.750
SAM: 28 points of damage.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:19.390
Constitution save is a 19, plus two, 21.

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:20.510
MATT: You're fine.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.002
So how much damage was that?

01:01:22.002 --> 01:01:23.600
LAURA: 28.
SAM: 28 points of damage.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.433
MATT: Nice.

01:01:24.433 --> 01:01:27.660
So as you run up the side from behind,

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.700
shoot it in the back of the head and then leap off,

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.610
landing on the ground.

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:32.380
You guys watch the front of it.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.650
One side of its face is sloughed off and is hanging.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:39.540
The other one has one bright-white milky eye

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.820
that's looking while the other one is hanging outward.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.950
The one that's currently in there, fine,

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.392
starts it's glancing around before (impacts).

01:01:46.392 --> 01:01:47.225
SAM: Oh!

01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:48.900
MATT: It gets struck from behind by a bolt

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.370
and even that's now dislodged a little bit out that side.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:52.612
LAURA: Gross!

01:01:52.612 --> 01:01:54.695
MATT: (groans)

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.720
If it was alive, it would be unhappy.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.970
ASHLEY: They're naturally looking rough.

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:01.420
MATT: Yes.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.260
TALIESIN: They're always looking rough.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.954
MATT: But well struck.

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.380
SAM: Can I bonus action or is that it?

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.430
MATT: You can bonus action.

01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:07.710
SAM: I'll bonus action, take one more shot.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.660
ASHLEY: Got it.
MATT: Okay, got for it.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.957
SAM: Natural 20.

01:02:10.957 --> 01:02:12.759
MARISHA: Oh!
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:02:12.759 --> 01:02:14.060
MATT: Which means you get another attack.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.560
SAM: So that's seven points of damage.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.740
It fires again for a 26.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.220
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and roll.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.742
SAM: For another 11 points of damage.

01:02:23.742 --> 01:02:26.280
MATT: Nice! Good round.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.113
ASHLEY: Very good round.

01:02:27.113 --> 01:02:28.411
TRAVIS: Come on, man.
SAM: I'll take it.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.604
LIAM: Way to play off the animated opening.

01:02:30.604 --> 01:02:31.862
MATT: You leap off and land

01:02:31.862 --> 01:02:33.012
and right as you're holding it behind you,

01:02:33.012 --> 01:02:34.880
it just goes off twice.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.030
You're like, "Oh shit!"

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.970
Sticks up into the side of its body.

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:39.850
Doesn't seem to react.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.269
No pain, but it's definitely carving into it.

01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:44.877
All right, that finishes your go. Beau, you are up.

01:02:44.877 --> 01:02:48.720
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to swing round

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.267
and I'm going to swing wide so that I'm kind of--

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.544
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw for me, please.

01:02:53.544 --> 01:02:56.993
MARISHA: Make a constitu-- okay.

01:02:56.993 --> 01:02:58.387
TRAVIS: Are you touching it?
MARISHA: Okay.

01:02:58.387 --> 01:02:59.870
LAURA: Oh, it's anything within--

01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:02.036
MARISHA: Within a certain, all right.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.156
That's--

01:03:06.156 --> 01:03:08.305
Mm, that's not good.

01:03:08.305 --> 01:03:09.660
SAM: Uh-oh.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.316
MARISHA: I am going to spend a ki point to re-roll.

01:03:12.316 --> 01:03:13.927
MATT: Okay.

01:03:13.927 --> 01:03:15.948
SAM: One of 27 ki points.

01:03:15.948 --> 01:03:17.039
MARISHA: Yes.

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:19.410
LIAM: Did she ignore that rule?

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.713
MARISHA: That is much better.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.130
Okay, that is 25 total.

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.430
MATT: 25 total? Yes.

01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:28.710
The cold emanating from this zombified giant

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:31.840
does not quite stick to your insides,

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.180
as you continue your turn. What are you doing?

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.640
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:38.670
swing round. I want to get in between

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:40.360
these two on this side.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.360
MATT: On this side?

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.450
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:47.214
I'm going to leap up on that guy's leg that's right there.

01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:48.670
I'm going to grab onto his belt

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:50.540
and I'm going to kidney punch!

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.700
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll for attack.
TRAVIS: Do the center.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.533
MARISHA: Yes.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.920
LAURA: The one holding Yasha?

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.623
MARISHA: The one that was holding Yasha, yes.

01:04:01.264 --> 01:04:02.097
Okay.

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:04.970
21?

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.380
MATT: 21 hits, yeah.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.130
MARISHA: That is--

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.220
Okay, that is

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:15.946
15 points of damage.

01:04:15.946 --> 01:04:17.554
MATT: 15 points of damage, nice.

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:20.144
MARISHA: I rolled pretty good. Stunning Strike.

01:04:20.144 --> 01:04:20.977
SAM: Ooh.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.113
MATT: That is a 19.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.523
MARISHA: He saves.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.610
Again, my second kidney punch.

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:33.790
That is really bad. That is a natural one.

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:34.960
MATT: Natural one?

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.700
You grab, you get one punch in the side

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.950
and as you pull back, your fist actually punctured

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:43.890
into its body and pulls back some of that thick, cold liquid

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:46.120
that's frozen to your fist and as you go to punch again,

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.910
it actually insulates it from the impact,

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:49.510
so the second hit has no effect.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:53.310
You have to shatter this purple ice off your fist.

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.850
MARISHA: Eww!

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:59.850
And I drop down and I'm just going to do two

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.500
bicycle kicks on the way down, Flurry of Blows.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.590
MATT: Go for it. (laughs)

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:07.276
How'd that go again?
MARISHA: A-Flurry of Blows!

01:05:07.276 --> 01:05:09.496
Pop, pop, pop!
LAURA: (laughs)

01:05:09.496 --> 01:05:12.090
MARISHA: Well, that's good. That's good.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.010
20 total.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.462
LIAM: One year into lockdown, folks.

01:05:15.462 --> 01:05:18.350
MARISHA: And 30 total. 20 and 30.

01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:19.983
MATT: Both hit.
MARISHA: All right.

01:05:21.345 --> 01:05:22.993
All right.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.580
Good, good, good, good. 15 damage again.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.413
MATT: Awesome.

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:33.393
MARISHA: Oh, Stunning Strike.

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.190
MATT: 18.

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:39.508
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. So close.

01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:43.190
And nine damage.

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:44.165
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:05:46.778 --> 01:05:47.611
MARISHA: I'm going to save them.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:51.215
MATT: You're going to save it?
LAURA: What's the save on a stun?

01:05:51.215 --> 01:05:52.337
MARISHA: 17.

01:05:52.337 --> 01:05:53.910
LAURA: But is it a wisdom save?

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:55.810
MARISHA: Constitution.
LAURA: Constitution? Okay.

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.860
MARISHA: You said they were rolling really well?

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.793
LAURA: On constitution.

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.600
MARISHA: Stunning Strike, I'm going to do it.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.108
I'm going to do it. One more.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.200
MATT: 21.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.550
LIAM: I would think a dead body that

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.291
can survive the cold--
MATT: It's progressively rolled higher.

01:06:12.291 --> 01:06:13.948
LIAM: -- is going to have a high con.

01:06:13.948 --> 01:06:16.630
MARISHA: ♪ Higher, higher and higher ♪

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.475
Yeah, agreed.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.170
But it's my trick.

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:22.075
LIAM: Yeah, you've got to do it.
MARISHA: Got to do it.

01:06:22.075 --> 01:06:23.410
MATT: You've got to.
LIAM: Got to play to win.

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:25.030
MARISHA: Extract Aspects.

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:28.080
MATT: All right, so as you bludgeon it on the way down,

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.063
your feet kicking into it,

01:06:29.063 --> 01:06:32.420
you can see part of the flesh strip off and hit the ground,

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.630
landing next to you. The smell is awful.

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:39.630
Actually, you open some normally frozen-off interior

01:06:40.146 --> 01:06:42.186
but gathering that one,

01:06:42.186 --> 01:06:47.030
it's probably immune to cold,

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:49.243
as well as poison, being an undead creature.

01:06:51.052 --> 01:06:52.352
And it cannot be poisoned.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.610
MARISHA: Cannot be poisoned?
MATT: Correct.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:55.858
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: But that's it.

01:06:55.858 --> 01:06:57.532
MARISHA: But that's it.

01:06:57.532 --> 01:06:59.670
MATT: Everything else seems to be open season.

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.297
MARISHA: All right, I just shout out:

01:07:01.297 --> 01:07:04.640
Avoid cold, obviously, and poison.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.673
TALIESIN: Obviously.

01:07:05.673 --> 01:07:07.100
MARISHA: It's pretty rank in there.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.710
(gags)

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:10.200
MATT: All right.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.710
That finishes-
MARISHA: Smells like low tide.

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:14.340
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.640
That finishes your go?
MARISHA: Yes.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.030
MATT: It's now their go.
LAURA: Ugh.

01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:19.680
MATT: So as you're saying this, the one that's above you,

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.620
it glances down after you've just beat into its knee

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:27.680
and its side and it's now pushed-out eye with the

01:07:29.842 --> 01:07:32.123
bolt sticking through it, you see it begins to glow

01:07:32.123 --> 01:07:36.260
but flicker, the other one that's hanging, dangling slightly

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.868
begins to glow blue.

01:07:37.868 --> 01:07:39.050
LIAM: Oh no.

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:40.110
MATT: Marisha, if you could make

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:42.471
a constitution saving throw for me, please.

01:07:42.471 --> 01:07:44.862
SAM, LIAM, and LAURA: Oh no.

01:07:44.862 --> 01:07:46.763
TALIESIN: It's he center one?
MATT: Center one, yeah.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.243
MARISHA: All right, okay.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.100
22.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.677
MATT: 22? Nice, all right.

01:07:55.677 --> 01:07:57.111
MARISHA: I rolled pretty high.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.700
MATT: As it begins to look down towards you, you see it--

01:08:03.588 --> 01:08:07.410
and this blast of cold energy streaks down from its face

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:10.037
and you just barely manage to drift off to the side

01:08:10.037 --> 01:08:13.070
and it scoots past you and you brace in for just being

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:15.980
in the proximity of that beam, but to no effect.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.080
MARISHA: Its got lasers? They've got cold lasers?

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:22.100
LAURA: They've got cold lasers.
MARISHA: They've got cold lasers!

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.450
(laughter)

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:27.590
LIAM: Have you been drinking the Natty Lights?

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:29.840
MARISHA: No, but dibs on one.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.673
LIAM: All right.

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:31.850
MATT: The other one on this side--

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:33.860
SAM: They drink real smooth.
LAURA: The skelly one?

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.340
MATT: No, no. This one right there.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.730
LAURA: Okay.

01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:39.170
MATT: This massive blade, this pockmarked,

01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:42.003
rusted giant cleaver-like blade in its hand.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.600
Looks down and it's going to go ahead and look towards you.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.140
I need you to make a constitution saving throw

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.730
for me as well, Jester.

01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:50.921
LAURA: No!

01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:53.788
But do I get resistance because I'm cold resistant?

01:08:53.788 --> 01:08:54.990
MATT: We'll find out.

01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:57.323
LAURA: Oh, no! I'm the first one!

01:08:57.323 --> 01:08:58.273
Nine! Oh!

01:08:58.273 --> 01:09:01.828
MATT: Oh no.
LAURA: Oh no, oh no

01:09:01.828 --> 01:09:03.908
Should I get advantage on it, though?

01:09:03.908 --> 01:09:05.730
MATT: No, you do not.

01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:07.121
LIAM: But I'm so cute.

01:09:07.121 --> 01:09:10.254
(laughter)

01:09:13.628 --> 01:09:16.820
MARISHA: That's a lot of dice.
LAURA: That's a lot of dice!

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.436
MATT: You take 38 points of cold damage.

01:09:19.436 --> 01:09:20.652
You are resistant to,

01:09:20.652 --> 01:09:22.480
LAURA: Uh-huh?
MATT: -- so you take half that.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.463
LAURA: Oh good!
MATT: So that's--

01:09:23.463 --> 01:09:24.296
LAURA: 16?

01:09:24.296 --> 01:09:25.660
MATT: 19?

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.635
LAURA: 19.
MATT: 19 points of cold damage.

01:09:28.635 --> 01:09:30.272
LIAM: 38, 18.

01:09:30.272 --> 01:09:31.890
LAURA: 38, 19.

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:33.467
LIAM: 38, split in half?

01:09:33.467 --> 01:09:36.275
LAURA: 19. Nine plus nine is 18.

01:09:36.275 --> 01:09:37.417
LIAM: I don't know what's going on.

01:09:37.417 --> 01:09:38.780
(laughter)

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.768
TRAVIS: We're not here for math.
MATT: Yeah, it's fine.

01:09:41.768 --> 01:09:44.427
LAURA: Oh no, are you going to freeze me?

01:09:44.427 --> 01:09:47.080
MATT: You guys watch as this beam streaks out

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.340
of its face and as it hits Jester, she locks into place.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.625
Ice coalesces around parts of your body.

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:55.645
LAURA: Oh no!
MATT: And you are paralyzed.

01:09:55.645 --> 01:09:56.478
SAM: Ooh!

01:09:56.478 --> 01:09:59.228
MARISHA: I just said watch out for the cold laser!

01:10:00.161 --> 01:10:01.453
TRAVIS: Paralyzed?
SAM: Jester, no!

01:10:01.453 --> 01:10:04.125
TRAVIS: But because of the ice, she's--

01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:04.958
MATT: Yeah.

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:05.940
TRAVIS: Is she still trying to get out

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.170
but the ice is keeping her in place or is she--

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.320
MATT: The ice is formed around her

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.685
and she's locked in place.

01:10:13.685 --> 01:10:14.643
LIAM: (groans)
SAM: Hm.

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:17.882
MATT: That finishes that one's turn. This one--

01:10:19.095 --> 01:10:20.861
ASHLEY: Skeletor.
LAURA: God!

01:10:20.861 --> 01:10:22.674
(gasps) Oh no, he's going to hit me now.
MATT: Charges up.

01:10:22.674 --> 01:10:23.640
SAM: Is he going to shatter you?

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.440
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I was--
MARISHA: No!

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.128
MATT: A massive great ax in its hands.

01:10:27.128 --> 01:10:28.568
LAURA: I'm going to die, you guys, this is the moment.

01:10:28.568 --> 01:10:30.620
MATT: And it's going to take two swings

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.510
at the now-paralyzed Jester.

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:34.727
LAURA: Does that mean he gets--

01:10:34.727 --> 01:10:35.560
MATT: It means he gets advantage on it.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.207
MARISHA: Wait, what can we do?

01:10:37.207 --> 01:10:39.707
MATT: And if they hit, they're auto-crits against you.

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:42.725
LAURA: Oh no.

01:10:42.725 --> 01:10:44.320
SAM: But you're resistant to cold?

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.190
MATT: That is 24 to hit.

01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:47.023
LAURA: Yeah.

01:10:47.023 --> 01:10:47.856
MATT: And the second one.

01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:54.250
Yeah, that's a 20-- no, that's a 28 to hit.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.100
So they both hit.

01:10:56.401 --> 01:10:58.490
TALIESIN: Do I get to cancel one of the criticals?

01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:59.323
MATT: If you're within range.

01:10:59.323 --> 01:11:00.370
TALIESIN: I'm within range.

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:01.567
MATT: You are.
SAM: Okay, okay.

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.073
MATT: So the first one does not crit.

01:11:04.887 --> 01:11:06.462
LAURA: What if I shatter?
SAM: The first one doesn't-- okay.

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:07.978
LIAM: Because of Caduceus' mojo.

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:11.257
MATT: So the first hit, you take--

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.964
SAM: This suddenly isn't fun anymore.

01:11:14.964 --> 01:11:16.100
MARISHA: No!

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.900
MATT: 28 points of slashing damage.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.733
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:21.010
MATT: As one carves into her side

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.400
and sends her into the air.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.080
Almost like golf swing, knocks her up in the air.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.850
You see this blast of divine grayish energy that

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:34.190
seems to sheer it off a bit, not quite going for a kill hit

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.568
like it wanted and instead knocking her up into the air

01:11:36.568 --> 01:11:39.660
and as she's frozen and spinning,

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:43.000
it winds up from that first strike and (grunts) its

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.820
mostly-skeletal body goes for a second strike against you.

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.590
LAURA: Is this the actual crit?

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:49.530
MATT: This is the actual crit.

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:50.720
MARISHA: Did you do the thing?

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.745
LAURA: He did it the first time.
LIAM: For one of them.

01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:54.998
LAURA: He can only do it once.
LIAM: Because they're auto-crits.

01:11:54.998 --> 01:11:57.300
So he uncritted a crit and the other one critted.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.940
MATT: You take 50 points of slashing damage.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.390
(groaning)

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:01.610
MATT: From the secondary strike.

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.713
SAM: 19 plus 50 plus 28?

01:12:04.936 --> 01:12:07.390
LAURA: Yeah, I'm down 100 points from that one.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:08.846
SAM: But you're still up?

01:12:08.846 --> 01:12:09.679
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:10.910
SAM: You're so good.

01:12:12.518 --> 01:12:14.000
MATT: And that's going to finish their turn.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:14.930
So, now--

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.770
LAURA: Am I paralyzed on the ground now?

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:19.370
MATT: You are, yeah.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:21.808
LAURA: Oh no, I shouldn't say this about myself.

01:12:21.808 --> 01:12:22.790
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:25.030
LAURA: Did I take damage as I fell?

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:29.800
MATT: No, I'm cinematically flavoring the blow.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.420
I'm not going to damage you for my own cinematic flavor.

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.480
SAM: Clearly Sprinkle was somewhere else.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.870
MATT: We'll say six damage of that attack was you falling.

01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:38.670
So you're fine. It's included in it.

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:43.073
But you all watch as suddenly these entities just swarm up.

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:47.550
One of them is battling the sudden charging

01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:49.010
and running around of ant-like beings

01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:51.530
that are the Mighty Nein on it, while the other two

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:54.770
go towards Jester at once and strike heavily

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.950
into her, bringing her nearly down in one round.

01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:59.320
Fjord, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.723
TRAVIS: Right, that totally changes what I was going to do.

01:13:01.723 --> 01:13:03.700
Appalled by what's happening in front of me,

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.433
I will run up next to Jester.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:11.820
I will run in front of her and turn my back to the giants.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.956
I will place both of my hands on either side of her face.

01:13:14.956 --> 01:13:16.430
MATT: Need you to make a constitution
saving throw for me, please.

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:17.310
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.833
LAURA: Oh no, what if you freeze?

01:13:20.358 --> 01:13:21.590
TRAVIS: 21.
MATT: 21.

01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:25.230
You managed to resist the numbing aura. Continue, please.

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:28.319
TRAVIS: I place my hands on either side of her face and say:

01:13:28.319 --> 01:13:31.140
Time to go, and I will cast Thunder Step,

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.723
and if she is willing, I can bring one extra person with me.

01:13:34.723 --> 01:13:35.556
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:13:35.556 --> 01:13:36.764
TRAVIS: And it will deal--

01:13:36.764 --> 01:13:37.760
LAURA: We've got to fight it.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.268
TRAVIS: -- 5d10 thunder damage to

01:13:40.268 --> 01:13:42.876
anything-- sorry-- within 10 feet of me,

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:46.220
but it'll take us 90 feet in the direction of my choice.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.120
MATT: Which direction do you want to go?

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.320
TRAVIS: Straight behind them, straight opposite of-- yeah.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.650
MATT: 90 feet? You want to go full distance?

01:13:55.450 --> 01:13:58.150
TRAVIS: Just behind that, more towards Marisha's chair.

01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:59.240
MATT: Over here?
TRAVIS: That's great, yeah.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240
MATT: You got it, okay.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.362
LIAM: Is Essek with us?

01:14:02.362 --> 01:14:03.195
MATT: He is.

01:14:03.195 --> 01:14:04.778
TRAVIS: Just to be specific about it,

01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:06.858
let's go right here.
LIAM: Thank god.

01:14:06.858 --> 01:14:08.333
MATT: Thank you. I'm so used to putting you guys

01:14:08.333 --> 01:14:11.421
on the board. That's okay, he rolled low initiative anyway.

01:14:11.421 --> 01:14:13.240
TRAVIS: I'll go right here, Matt.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.470
MATT: Over there?
TRAVIS: Right there, yeah.

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:15.303
MATT: Got it.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.071
Okay.
LIAM: Oh, that's a cool angle.

01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:19.634
TRAVIS: 5d10.

01:14:19.634 --> 01:14:20.645
TALIESIN: Oh that's cool.

01:14:20.645 --> 01:14:21.820
LIAM: I can't tell the depth anymore,

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.872
but it looks real great.

01:14:23.872 --> 01:14:24.848
TRAVIS: 16.

01:14:26.173 --> 01:14:27.914
10.

01:14:27.914 --> 01:14:29.248
Oh, and one more.

01:14:34.105 --> 01:14:35.990
31 points of thunder damage.

01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:37.450
MATT: And what's the save?

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:38.920
TRAVIS: 18 constitution.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.005
MATT: All right, so that fellow there

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.083
succeeds.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.393
So he takes nine.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.253
That guy does not succeed.

01:14:51.458 --> 01:14:53.363
So he takes 18.

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:57.030
All right, I need Yasha and Caleb

01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:58.780
to make constitution saving throws.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:02.973
LIAM: 17.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.690
MATT: 18 points of thunder damage to you.

01:15:05.690 --> 01:15:06.710
LIAM: Okay.

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:07.680
ASHLEY: 20.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.380
MATT: You take nine points of thunder damage.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.397
LIAM: I failed that? Man.

01:15:10.397 --> 01:15:11.230
MATT: You did.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.750
ASHLEY: Nine, did you say?

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.040
MATT: You take nine, yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.620
MATT: You watch as Fjord rushes over, grabs Jester,

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.490
and then they both vanish and in a brief moment

01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:22.690
where they were, there's this little pocket,

01:15:23.588 --> 01:15:26.210
and it emits this explosive concussive energy.

01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:27.710
Like a lightning strike, it hit,

01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:29.660
and the thunderous wave blasts out,

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:31.710
damaging both of the undead giants,

01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:34.103
and both of you, unfortunately, because of your proximity.

01:15:34.103 --> 01:15:37.350
TRAVIS: Did they only get nine and 18 for a reason?

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:38.860
It was 31 points of damage.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.870
MATT: Oh, my brain totally went off on that.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.545
I think because I rolled a 19--

01:15:42.545 --> 01:15:43.895
TRAVIS: Sorry to give you more.
MATT: Sorry.

01:15:43.895 --> 01:15:46.230
So it was 31? 31 to you, Caleb.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:47.063
LIAM: Hold on, hold on.

01:15:47.063 --> 01:15:49.257
TRAVIS: I think it was 30 or 31.
LIAM: Let me max myself out first

01:15:49.257 --> 01:15:52.020
and then lose 31, okay. 31.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.458
MATT: And then it's 15, we'll say, to you, Yasha.

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:55.938
TRAVIS: It might've been 30. I can't remember.

01:15:55.938 --> 01:15:58.565
MATT: Take one more point, it's good.

01:15:58.565 --> 01:16:01.400
TRAVIS: It's come down to one point before.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.709
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: That's true, that's true.

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:05.653
Well, we'll deal with it if we come to it.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.350
All right, that brings us to--

01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:09.107
ASHLEY: I still take half because--

01:16:09.107 --> 01:16:11.610
MATT and TRAVIS: Because you made your save.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:14.260
ASHLEY: That's right, I rolled to--
MATT: Yeah, you rolled good.

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.368
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

01:16:15.368 --> 01:16:16.750
MATT: It's okay.

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:19.580
Jester, you are still paralyzed, unfortunately.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.010
That ends your turn.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.333
It is now Essek's go.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:29.570
LIAM: Now playing for Den Thelyss.

01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:31.700
TRAVIS: Actually--
LIAM: Essek, Essek, Essek.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.641
TRAVIS: Could I,

01:16:32.641 --> 01:16:36.673
because that was not the full part of my turn--

01:16:36.673 --> 01:16:38.750
MATT: Sure, because you have more movement--

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.503
TRAVIS: More movement and a bonus.

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:44.130
Could I use the next 20 feet, let's say?

01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:47.050
Or 15 feet, to come around this way.

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:48.200
MATT: This way or this way?

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.910
TRAVIS: To, yeah, this direction over here.

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.940
MATT: Okay, that's 20 feet there.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:57.250
TRAVIS: Am I within 30 feet of that giant in the center?

01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:00.380
MATT: Unfortunately, no. He is about 35, 40 feet from you.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.213
TRAVIS: All right, fair enough.

01:17:01.213 --> 01:17:03.485
I'll retract that last 10 and just put myself

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:05.380
back behind cover and that'll be my turn.

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.830
MATT: Okay, no worries.
TRAVIS: Thanks.

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:09.640
MATT: All right, now for Essek's go.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640
TRAVIS: Every turn counts.

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:15.540
MATT: Essek, seeing this go very poorly very quickly,

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:18.080
glancing about and sees you holding out the holy sword,

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.678
and just goes,

01:17:19.678 --> 01:17:22.077
(sighs)

01:17:22.077 --> 01:17:24.280
"I suppose you're the one to light them up?"

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.810
And he's going to go ahead and bring his hands forward

01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:28.280
and as he begins to put his hands outward,

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.790
you see this image of a clock made of ethereal

01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:35.230
energy and on the face of it you see this almost metallic

01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:39.210
image of you on it and as he grabs it, he spins it

01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:40.670
and cranks it like a wheel and as it does,

01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:42.850
you feel your body suddenly begin to surge with energy.

01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:46.040
Time begins to almost slow down around you. You are hasted.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.119
SAM: Yeah.

01:17:48.119 --> 01:17:48.952
ASHLEY: Cool.

01:17:48.952 --> 01:17:51.330
TRAVIS: Oh, he hasted the barbarian.

01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:53.030
MARISHA: Yeah. Dope.

01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:54.050
TALIESIN: That's how it's done.

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.170
TRAVIS: I'll buy a ticket to that show.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.003
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:01.070
MATT: With that, he is going to

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.750
move (chuckles) and he's like, (groans).

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:09.600
He does that and looks over and sees that guy and goes,

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.733
"Well, um."

01:18:11.972 --> 01:18:14.690
(laughter)
SAM: Oh no.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.110
MATT: Drifts into the corner with his fists up,

01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:18.190
looking over towards you, Caleb,

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:21.487
and Caduceus around the corner, and he's like,

01:18:21.487 --> 01:18:24.230
"Trust!" (laughs nervously)

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:25.063
All right.

01:18:25.063 --> 01:18:26.779
LIAM: It's three undead giants

01:18:26.779 --> 01:18:28.295
and two librarians in the corner.

01:18:28.295 --> 01:18:30.970
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: Yep, yep.

01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:32.890
TRAVIS: Totally fine. (laughs)

01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:34.220
MATT: All right, Caduceus, you are up.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:36.470
Caleb, you're on deck.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:18:37.392 --> 01:18:38.990
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:41.392
LAURA: Do it. Do it, Caduceus.

01:18:42.959 --> 01:18:45.140
TALIESIN: A lot of options have been taken away from me

01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:47.620
due to the territory.

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.460
Who's within 30 feet of me? Let's see, one, two, three.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.400
LIAM: Essek, Caleb, Yasha.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.369
TALIESIN: Is it just Essek, Caleb and Yasha?

01:18:55.369 --> 01:18:58.970
MATT: Essek, Caleb and Yasha and Beauregard.

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:01.800
TALIESIN: Okay, so one, two, three, four, five.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.063
MATT: Oh, I'm going to sneeze.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.316
TALIESIN: Just because this is

01:19:06.316 --> 01:19:07.532
probably going to be a problem

01:19:07.532 --> 01:19:11.850
for a while, I'm just going to do a Bless blast

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:13.852
and I'm going to hit everybody, including myself.

01:19:13.852 --> 01:19:15.910
MARISHA and MATT: Bless blast!
TALIESIN: Bless blast.

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:18.883
Everyone within 30 feet of me gets a d4 on all saves

01:19:18.883 --> 01:19:20.023
and attacks.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.600
LIAM: Oh my god, have you tried
the new Raspberry Bless Blast?

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.950
TALIESIN: Bless Blast!

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:27.290
ASHLEY: d4 to saves and attacks?
TALIESIN: And attacks.

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:29.023
So when you attack, you add a d4.

01:19:29.023 --> 01:19:31.170
When you roll a save, you add a d4.

01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:32.850
MATT: You, Yasha, Caleb.

01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:35.090
LIAM: It's saves and-- we've done it a billion times.

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:36.830
It's saves and what again?
TALIESIN: It's saves and attacks.

01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:38.910
Attack doesn't help you at all, but the saves do.

01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:40.420
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: And who else did you say?

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:44.890
TALIESIN: That and I think everyone within 30 feet of me.

01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:45.723
MATT: Got you.

01:19:45.723 --> 01:19:48.823
So that would be there and Beauregard as well.

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:52.312
TALIESIN: Let's see. One, two, three, four.

01:19:52.312 --> 01:19:54.136
And Essek, yeah. That's what I got.

01:19:56.886 --> 01:19:59.230
Is there anything I can do as a fucking bonus action,

01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:01.810
or is this just like my fucking bullshit?

01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:03.070
SAM: You made this character.

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:05.923
TALIESIN: He has nothing good for bonus action.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.430
I guess for my bonus action, for the moment,

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:11.690
because this not going to be useful later,

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:13.470
I'm just going to turn invisible.

01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:14.950
SAM: Sure.
MATT: Okay.

01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:17.650
TALIESIN: And then get a little cover in that hole.

01:20:17.650 --> 01:20:19.897
SAM: ♪ Get a little cover ♪

01:20:19.897 --> 01:20:23.950
MATT: You move ever so carefully into the dark space.

01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:25.480
TALIESIN: Just getting a little distance

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.210
from whatever the fuck this is.
MATT: Fair enough.

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:28.310
Finishing your go. Caleb, you're up.

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:29.210
Yasha, you're on deck.

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:31.550
LIAM: Okay, I will go just five feet diagonally

01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:34.845
towards the ice wall there so I'm right next to Essek.

01:20:34.845 --> 01:20:36.353
MATT: Here?
LIAM: No, other way.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.670
Against the wall, please.

01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:40.220
MATT: Against the wall, you got it.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.150
LIAM: Pulling a cocoon out of

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.163
my satchel and I begin to cast,

01:20:48.230 --> 01:20:50.910
pointing towards the undamaged one there,

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:55.190
and I will turn that undead giant, hopefully, into a sloth.

01:20:55.190 --> 01:20:56.870
MATT: Into a sloth? Okay.

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:58.600
What is the--

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.182
LIAM: It's wisdom and it's 18.

01:21:01.182 --> 01:21:02.220
TALIESIN: (whistles)

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:03.725
MATT: To this one here?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:08.380
MATT: That is a failure.

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:09.213
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:21:09.213 --> 01:21:10.473
LIAM: Then I will continue.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.207
To Essek, really quickly I will say:

01:21:13.207 --> 01:21:15.330
See you on the other side of the war.

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:18.260
And slide along the ice towards this new sloth

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.557
and get as close as I can.

01:21:19.557 --> 01:21:21.000
Look at that cute little frog!

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.257
ASHLEY: Look at that.

01:21:24.104 --> 01:21:25.774
MATT: That's about as close
as you can get with your movement.

01:21:25.774 --> 01:21:26.980
LIAM: Yeah, that's too close to the giant.

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.880
Could I stay against the wall, please?
MATT: You can.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.390
LIAM: GM? Thank you.

01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:32.780
MATT: That's why I need your guidance. You got it right.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.855
So you watch as it (groans, whooshing)

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.906
LIAM: Don't. Hit. The sloth!

01:21:40.906 --> 01:21:44.840
(laughter)

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.132
TRAVIS: Important note for a group like ours!

01:21:47.132 --> 01:21:48.615
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

01:21:48.615 --> 01:21:50.413
TALIESIN: Fluffernutter.
MARISHA: Yep.

01:21:50.413 --> 01:21:52.924
TRAVIS: Everybody just stops fighting and turns.

01:21:52.924 --> 01:21:54.140
MATT: (laughs)

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:56.280
TALIESIN: Even the giants.
TRAVIS: "Okay?"

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:59.740
MATT: Indeed. All right, that finishes your go, Caleb.

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:00.975
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:02.830
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:07.803
Going to use this Holy Avenger for the first time.

01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:08.800
TRAVIS: Fucking go!

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.503
ASHLEY: So hold it, and I'm going to try to--

01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:15.300
I'm going to take my first swing against the Big Blue.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:16.133
MATT: Right there?
ASHLEY: Yep.

01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:17.558
MATT: You got it.

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:18.391
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.273
(groans)

01:22:21.273 --> 01:22:22.330
SAM: Sword breaks.

01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:23.680
MATT: Now, looking at this--
TALIESIN: Plus d4-

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.625
MATT: -- you are flanked, technically, which

01:22:25.625 --> 01:22:27.763
I forgot earlier from placement-wise. You are

01:22:27.763 --> 01:22:29.269
catty corner with Beauregard.
ASHLEY: Oh, yes!

01:22:29.269 --> 01:22:30.510
MATT: So you would have advantage on these strikes.

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:31.593
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
TALIESIN: And a d4.

01:22:31.593 --> 01:22:32.715
MARISHA: Yes!

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:36.380
ASHLEY: Oh, goddamn it! Both bad!

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.910
MATT: And a d4, because of the blessing.

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:40.390
ASHLEY: It's not going to do-- it's a two.

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:43.045
TALIESIN: Oh, they're both--
ASHLEY: Well, hold on, hold on.

01:22:43.045 --> 01:22:45.361
(chatters)

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:47.241
SAM and LIAM: (mimic chattering)

01:22:47.241 --> 01:22:50.074
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. So--

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.020
LIAM: What's your Haste--?
ASHLEY: 15?

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:54.853
MATT: 15?
ASHLEY: Wait, hold on.

01:22:54.853 --> 01:22:56.068
Does Haste do anything?

01:22:56.068 --> 01:22:58.090
No. Okay.

01:22:58.090 --> 01:22:59.708
MATT: 15 just hits.

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:01.469
(cheering)

01:23:01.469 --> 01:23:03.865
MARISHA: Work it, boys!
ASHLEY: Worth it!

01:23:03.865 --> 01:23:05.780
Okay, okay, okay.
TALIESIN: War class! (grunts)

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:08.610
MATT: So that first strike hits, carves into it!

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:09.936
Go ahead and roll damage on that.

01:23:09.936 --> 01:23:10.794
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:23:10.794 --> 01:23:13.098
TRAVIS: I don't know if you're feeling it or not.

01:23:13.098 --> 01:23:15.762
ASHLEY: All right, let's do these three.

01:23:15.762 --> 01:23:17.395
TALIESIN: If I hadn't totally blessed you--

01:23:17.395 --> 01:23:19.361
LIAM: I made one a sloth, but don't hit it, please.

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:20.230
Oh, you are frozen.

01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:21.171
MARISHA: That would have been slappable.

01:23:21.171 --> 01:23:23.479
ASHLEY: Savage Attacker, that wasn't great.

01:23:23.479 --> 01:23:24.370
Much better!

01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:25.950
TALIESIN: Mighty punch.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:27.690
MARISHA: Holy Punch?
TRAVIS: Holy Punch.

01:23:27.690 --> 01:23:29.523
MARISHA: Holy Punches?
SAM: Holy Punch!

01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:33.140
ASHLEY: Sorry, math.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.370
MATT: We're sorry, math.
LAURA and TALIESIN: Sorry, math!

01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:36.520
MATT: We abuse you so much.

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.379
LIAM: Six years in: "Sorry, math."

01:23:39.379 --> 01:23:40.921
ASHLEY: Okay, 30.
MARISHA: We owe it that much.

01:23:40.921 --> 01:23:42.071
SAM: 30 points of damage?

01:23:42.071 --> 01:23:44.063
ASHLEY: 30 points of damage, but

01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:49.300
if I hit a fiend or an undead with it,

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.575
that creature takes an extra 2d10 damage.

01:23:52.575 --> 01:23:54.283
MATT: Indeed! With the Holy Avenger, it does.

01:23:54.283 --> 01:23:55.543
TRAVIS: Let's go, stats!

01:23:55.543 --> 01:23:58.247
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay!
TRAVIS: Let's go, barbarian!

01:23:58.247 --> 01:23:59.567
ASHLEY: Here we go, here we go!

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:00.683
MARISHA: Stats, stats, stats, stats!

01:24:00.683 --> 01:24:02.024
ASHLEY: Boy, I haven't rolled 10s in a minute.

01:24:02.024 --> 01:24:03.013
LIAM: I want to see you in

01:24:03.013 --> 01:24:05.252
a Yasha-colored jersey and face paint.

01:24:05.252 --> 01:24:06.579
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:24:06.579 --> 01:24:08.783
I have a big-ass foam finger.
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:24:08.783 --> 01:24:11.539
ASHLEY: 15 additional points.
LAURA: I want to be tall.

01:24:11.539 --> 01:24:13.122
SAM: That's 45.

01:24:14.514 --> 01:24:15.664
ASHLEY: 45?
MATT: So Ashley--

01:24:15.664 --> 01:24:17.213
SAM: You're hasted, don't you get another attack?

01:24:17.213 --> 01:24:18.055
LIAM: Yep.
ASHLEY: I do.

01:24:18.055 --> 01:24:18.888
MATT: Well, you have two attacks

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.000
and then you have a bonus action attack

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.750
if you want it with Haste.

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:22.583
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Well, no. You have a bonus action

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:23.610
and an additional attack.

01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:25.608
That's right, because Haste give you four.
ASHLEY: So three attacks plus

01:24:25.608 --> 01:24:26.860
a bonus?
MATT: Plus a bonus, yeah.

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.377
ASHLEY: Holy mackerel!

01:24:28.377 --> 01:24:30.030
Okay, so, okay.
(laughter)

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:31.977
Second, second--

01:24:31.977 --> 01:24:32.810
Second hit.

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:35.407
SAM: We're going to be here for a while.

01:24:35.407 --> 01:24:36.473
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

01:24:36.473 --> 01:24:38.516
(cheering)

01:24:38.516 --> 01:24:40.993
TRAVIS: Okay, take your time. Add it all up.

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.552
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.
MATT: So Brutal Critical.

01:24:42.552 --> 01:24:43.385
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:24:43.385 --> 01:24:44.300
MARISHA: All the dice.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.002
ASHLEY: So second hit is 2d6.

01:24:47.002 --> 01:24:48.915
MATT: Correct.
ASHLEY: So let me--

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.667
Come on, roll well because I already did Savage Attacker.

01:24:51.667 --> 01:24:53.022
TRAVIS: Like doing your taxes.

01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:55.434
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: Don't equate that.

01:24:55.434 --> 01:24:56.440
LAURA: (laughs)

01:24:58.206 --> 01:25:01.847
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. So you roll the dice rolled?

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:03.810
The dice rolled is what you double.

01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:04.643
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Right.

01:25:04.643 --> 01:25:09.643
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. So that would be, (laughs) hold on.

01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:11.170
Okay, 12.

01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:13.006
So it wasn't crazy.
MATT: Including that extra 2d10.

01:25:13.006 --> 01:25:13.839
SAM: Maybe out next theme song

01:25:13.839 --> 01:25:16.439
should just be instructions for how to roll damage.

01:25:16.439 --> 01:25:17.393
TRAVIS: Yep, yeah.

01:25:17.393 --> 01:25:19.198
MARISHA: Yeah. Just a "Schoolhouse Rock" song.

01:25:19.198 --> 01:25:20.041
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. Like a--

01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:21.172
TRAVIS: ♪ Roll your d20 ♪

01:25:21.172 --> 01:25:22.375
LIAM: ♪ The leg bone connected to the-- ♪

01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:23.869
TRAVIS: ♪ To see if you're hit ♪

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:27.770
SAM: ♪ Then if you do consult your character sheet ♪

01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:29.510
LIAM: ♪ Attack roll before the damage roll ♪
ASHLEY: 12,

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:33.042
total for the 2d10. So I double both of those?

01:25:33.042 --> 01:25:34.600
MATT: Well, you double the dice as well.
ASHLEY: So it's six.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.002
MATT: So 12 plus 12?

01:25:36.002 --> 01:25:37.427
LIAM: ♪ That's how we do reverse math ♪
ASHLEY: 12 plus 12, yeah.

01:25:37.427 --> 01:25:38.260
MATT: So 24.

01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:40.246
48 plus whatever bonuses you got on top of that.

01:25:40.246 --> 01:25:42.445
ASHLEY: Jeez louise. 48, okay 48.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.153
55, 58, if raging an extra three?

01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:50.720
No, no, no, that is the three.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.947
No, no, no, that's the melee.

01:25:51.947 --> 01:25:53.660
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.980
Figure this out in the moment.

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:55.880
MATT: You got it, you got it.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.767
TRAVIS: I remember this pain.

01:25:56.767 --> 01:25:57.600
ASHLEY: Fuck!

01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:00.818
Oh my god! What number did you say, 48?

01:26:00.818 --> 01:26:02.249
MATT: 48.
ASHLEY: Okay, 48.

01:26:02.249 --> 01:26:03.821
MATT: Plus three from the sword.

01:26:03.821 --> 01:26:06.390
LIAM: Drunk with power.
MATT: Plus four from the rage,

01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:08.190
plus three from your strength.

01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:10.104
So it's plus 10 to that, so 58.

01:26:10.104 --> 01:26:12.153
TRAVIS: 58.
ASHLEY: 58.

01:26:12.153 --> 01:26:14.190
MATT: 58 points of damage, I'm pretty sure.

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:15.190
Somewhere in the neighborhood.

01:26:15.190 --> 01:26:16.528
Regardless, how do you want to do this?

01:26:16.528 --> 01:26:18.128
(cheering)

01:26:18.128 --> 01:26:19.865
That was a heavy cleave on him.

01:26:19.865 --> 01:26:21.296
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Plus Holy Avenger damage,

01:26:21.296 --> 01:26:22.585
plus Brutal Critical.

01:26:22.585 --> 01:26:24.876
ASHLEY: I'm going to take the Holy Avenger

01:26:24.876 --> 01:26:27.301
and I'm going to do a big fucking swing at his knee

01:26:27.301 --> 01:26:29.486
to make him bend the knee.

01:26:29.486 --> 01:26:32.350
And then, when he's down to my level,

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:34.990
I want to (whooshing) clean off, cut off the head.

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:36.170
MATT: Hell yeah.

01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:38.770
As you cut through the back of the kneecap,

01:26:38.770 --> 01:26:40.730
its knee explodes and you watch it

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:43.390
(groaning) crumble to the ground.

01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:46.140
It hits on its shoulder and its elbow

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:48.030
and as the weight hits it, you see its whole arm

01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.070
dislodges from the shoulder

01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:52.940
with a sickening snapping sound as it tries to get back up.

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.290
And as it does, you use the momentum to swing back up.

01:26:56.290 --> 01:26:59.684
And with that, the head just goes (whooshes, thudding)

01:26:59.684 --> 01:27:01.620
and you have to almost dodge out to the side.

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:03.660
You guys watch as the head rolls backward

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:05.370
and Veth, you have to sidestep it

01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:06.946
as, like a massive bowling ball,

01:27:06.946 --> 01:27:08.080
(thudding)

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.405
TRAVIS: Lasers. (zapping)

01:27:10.405 --> 01:27:12.147
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:27:12.147 --> 01:27:13.088
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

01:27:13.088 --> 01:27:14.771
SAM: You still have two more attacks.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:15.877
ASHLEY: One more attack.

01:27:15.877 --> 01:27:17.923
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: And a bonus.

01:27:17.923 --> 01:27:18.950
TALIESIN: Two more, right?

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:20.171
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: No, one more attack--

01:27:20.171 --> 01:27:21.262
MATT: One more attack and a bonus, yeah.

01:27:21.262 --> 01:27:22.203
ASHLEY: I just hold the sword and I'm like:

01:27:22.203 --> 01:27:23.410
Oh, I love this thing!

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:25.882
TRAVIS: It's kind of vibrating.

01:27:25.882 --> 01:27:28.110
ASHLEY: Okay, next attack.

01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:29.410
MATT: Clean blade, too.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:32.693
ASHLEY: Skeletor to the left.
TRAVIS: Ooh! Clean blade.

01:27:32.693 --> 01:27:35.216
ASHLEY: Oh, that's not good.
LIAM: ♪ -- to the right now ♪

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.092
ASHLEY: Oh wait, I can roll a d4.

01:27:36.092 --> 01:27:38.750
MARISHA: ♪ Stuck in the middle with you ♪

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.250
ASHLEY: Oh, 14!

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:44.575
MATT: 14 does not hit.

01:27:44.575 --> 01:27:45.742
ASHLEY: Boo.
MARISHA: With the d4?

01:27:45.742 --> 01:27:46.778
ASHLEY: With the d4.
MARISHA: (sighs)

01:27:46.778 --> 01:27:50.310
ASHLEY: Yeah, I rolled bad. Okay, so then bonus action.

01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:51.550
What I'd like to do-- oh, wow!

01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:53.671
Guys, I think I know how to play D&amp;D now.

01:27:53.671 --> 01:27:55.070
(laughter)

01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:57.190
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to let out a--

01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:58.450
MARISHA: It just clicked.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.620
ASHLEY: Oh wait, no, that's an action.

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:02.524
No, no, no, it's not.

01:28:02.524 --> 01:28:03.940
Okay, Zealous Presence!

01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:06.990
I spoke too soon. I'm going to let out a battle cry.

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.823
SAM: Ah!

01:28:07.823 --> 01:28:11.430
ASHLEY: So everybody within 60 feet

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:13.872
has advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

01:28:13.872 --> 01:28:15.450
LAURA: Sick!

01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:18.552
ASHLEY: In addition to his d4, so I think we're good.

01:28:18.552 --> 01:28:19.385
MATT: All righty.

01:28:19.385 --> 01:28:20.930
ASHLEY: And that's my turn.
LAURA: We get it.

01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:22.323
MATT: Cool, that finishes Yasha's go.

01:28:22.323 --> 01:28:23.349
TRAVIS: I was almost there.

01:28:23.349 --> 01:28:24.283
MATT: Veth, you're up.
ASHLEY: That was fun!

01:28:24.283 --> 01:28:25.349
MATT: With Beau on deck.

01:28:25.349 --> 01:28:27.140
LIAM: That means everybody watched her go ham

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.970
and scream and everyone went--

01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:31.493
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:28:31.493 --> 01:28:32.326
ASHLEY: That was fun.
MARISHA: True!

01:28:32.326 --> 01:28:33.159
TRAVIS: Yeah, terrible.

01:28:33.159 --> 01:28:35.833
SAM: I will-- oh, I didn't think I was going

01:28:35.833 --> 01:28:37.416
to get to go again.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.820
I will just drop to one knee,

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:44.510
stabilize my arm,

01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:47.930
aim true, and fire with advantage, right?

01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:50.670
So that's that's good for me.

01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:53.044
Mm, that's not good. 17!

01:28:53.044 --> 01:28:53.877
MATT: 17 hits.

01:28:53.877 --> 01:28:56.170
SAM: Okay, sneak attack damage.

01:28:56.170 --> 01:28:58.606
TRAVIS: Loves these minis. "Minis."

01:29:00.706 --> 01:29:02.764
SAM: 10.
MATT: Yeah.

01:29:03.773 --> 01:29:07.422
SAM: 20, 28. 34 points of damage.

01:29:07.422 --> 01:29:08.630
MATT: Nice!

01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:13.130
SAM: And then I'll just shoot again

01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:15.213
because it seems like we hit these things.

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:19.290
That one is a 23 to hit.

01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:20.310
MATT: That hits.

01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:22.310
SAM: For another 10 points of damage.

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:23.870
MATT: Slick.

01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:27.901
SAM: And then I'll use my remainder to run towards Fjord.

01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:30.840
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's me you're coming for.

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.340
MATT: You don't know where Fjord is.

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:33.980
You just watched Fjord vanish.

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:37.060
SAM: Well, I will run. I'm running away.

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.882
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Backwards.

01:29:38.882 --> 01:29:40.290
(laughs)

01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:41.277
MATT: Now you see Fjord.

01:29:41.277 --> 01:29:42.848
SAM: Oh, hey!
TRAVIS: Hey!

01:29:42.848 --> 01:29:44.320
MATT: There you go.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.835
SAM: How's Frosty over there?

01:29:46.835 --> 01:29:47.776
TRAVIS: Frozen!

01:29:47.776 --> 01:29:48.966
SAM: Oh god.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:53.506
MATT: That finishes your go. Beau, you're up.

01:29:53.506 --> 01:29:56.391
MARISHA: Pumped from Yasha's battle rage,

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.690
I pop-pop!

01:29:58.690 --> 01:30:00.850
MATT: Okay, towards the skeleton?

01:30:00.850 --> 01:30:01.694
MARISHA: Yes!

01:30:01.694 --> 01:30:02.940
TRAVIS: That's my girlfriend!

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:04.898
MATT: There you go, as you rush forward--
MARISHA: Ugh, she's so hot!

01:30:06.998 --> 01:30:08.500
Oh, wait, advantage, right? Okay.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.530
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Oh, first one.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.332
Oh, that one's cocked and it's cocked on a 20.

01:30:13.332 --> 01:30:14.315
That was a 19.

01:30:14.315 --> 01:30:16.079
Oh, that's a natural 20!

01:30:16.079 --> 01:30:17.129
(laughter)

01:30:17.129 --> 01:30:18.526
MARISHA: He did it! He did it!

01:30:18.526 --> 01:30:19.810
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:30:19.810 --> 01:30:22.160
MARISHA: Oh, that was the Gil dice! Okay, okay, okay!

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.447
(laughter)

01:30:24.447 --> 01:30:25.681
MARISHA: I'm so happy!
MATT: I love it!

01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:26.514
I love this moment so much!

01:30:26.514 --> 01:30:28.684
MARISHA: Wait, do I get a d4? No, okay, okay.

01:30:28.684 --> 01:30:29.792
TALIESIN: That's not damage.
SAM: More math.

01:30:29.792 --> 01:30:30.980
MARISHA: Just one die, one die right now.

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.221
I rolled a one on the damage die.

01:30:34.221 --> 01:30:35.714
(laughter)
MATT: Aww.

01:30:35.714 --> 01:30:37.864
SAM: It's doubled.
LAURA: Use your ki points--

01:30:37.864 --> 01:30:39.210
SAM: It's doubled.
LAURA: -- to give you more!

01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:40.642
MATT: It doesn't.
MARISHA: I can't do that.

01:30:40.642 --> 01:30:42.059
TRAVIS: Like an EKG, just (beeping)
MARISHA: No!

01:30:42.059 --> 01:30:43.335
LAURA: I thought it did everything!
MARISHA: No.

01:30:43.335 --> 01:30:45.410
I wish. That's the one thing!
LIAM: You just say it's dope monk shit.

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:46.535
That fixes it.

01:30:46.535 --> 01:30:48.100
MATT: (laughs)
MARISHA: (sighs)

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.000
Okay.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.260
MARISHA: Well, that's eight damage.

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.670
No, nine damage, because I double the one.

01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:55.748
MATT: There you go! Nine damage critical.

01:30:55.748 --> 01:30:58.050
Whack! First strike on it.

01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:00.150
MARISHA: It's just really stung, you know?

01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.295
MATT: It did, it did.

01:31:01.295 --> 01:31:02.424
MARISHA: Okay, okay, next one, next one.

01:31:02.424 --> 01:31:05.950
MATT: Smacking into its hefty, thick, bony shin.

01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:08.610
This crack emerges.

01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:12.493
MARISHA: But I think I can-- okay. Okay, 11.

01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:15.995
So 21, 23.

01:31:15.995 --> 01:31:17.294
MATT: That hits, yeah.
MARISHA: All right.

01:31:17.294 --> 01:31:18.286
TRAVIS: Okay, you were inspired,

01:31:18.286 --> 01:31:20.005
but still shook by Yasha's battle cry.

01:31:20.005 --> 01:31:21.743
MARISHA: It's true.
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:25.400
SAM: Ashley's still doing the math over there.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.376
MARISHA: 13 damage on that one.
ASHLEY: I actually, legitimately am.

01:31:27.376 --> 01:31:28.659
I'm like, "Okay, hold on."

01:31:28.659 --> 01:31:29.909
MATT: What's that?
MARISHA: 13 damage.

01:31:29.909 --> 01:31:31.775
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: I made sheets, like--

01:31:31.775 --> 01:31:34.510
MARISHA: And I might as well Flurry of Blows.

01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:35.970
MATT: Go for it, might as well.

01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:36.990
MARISHA: Do this again.

01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:38.150
TALIESIN: Keep hitting it til it drops.

01:31:38.150 --> 01:31:39.130
MARISHA: Keep hitting it.

01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:41.047
And I got advantage on these, so.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.111
SAM: Guys, it's time to stand.

01:31:44.111 --> 01:31:45.375
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: Watch said.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:46.466
LAURA: (laughs) I'm getting the notice.

01:31:46.466 --> 01:31:48.002
(laughter)

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.680
TRAVIS: You just leave your arm hanging down.

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.040
MARISHA: 20 total.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.903
MATT: 20 total, all righty.

01:31:51.903 --> 01:31:52.736
LAURA: If you move a lot--

01:31:52.736 --> 01:31:54.594
MARISHA: 14 damage on that one.
LAURA: If you move a lot while you're playing,

01:31:54.594 --> 01:31:55.992
It thinks you're walking.
MATT: Nice!

01:31:55.992 --> 01:31:56.994
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Gesticulate.

01:31:56.994 --> 01:31:58.415
LAURA: It thinks that you're working out.
SAM: Hold on, I got to breathe

01:31:58.415 --> 01:31:59.248
for a minute.

01:31:59.248 --> 01:32:01.407
MARISHA: Ooh, it's a 19!

01:32:01.407 --> 01:32:02.640
TRAVIS: And breathe.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.208
MARISHA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: You can still do it!

01:32:04.208 --> 01:32:05.183
MARISHA: 15 damage.

01:32:05.183 --> 01:32:06.200
MATT: 15 damage.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.990
LAURA: I always get full activity--

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.912
MARISHA: And that's it!
LAURA: -- from the game.

01:32:08.912 --> 01:32:10.186
MATT: All right, that finishes your go.

01:32:10.186 --> 01:32:12.300
MARISHA: That finishes my go.
LAURA: Yes!

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:14.080
LIAM: Close those runs.

01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:18.340
MATT: The angry frost giant now being rapidly sliced

01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.628
and then bludgeoned repeatedly glances down

01:32:20.628 --> 01:32:23.210
(groans) holding its giant greataxe,

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:25.060
still at its chest height.

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:29.570
It brings it high and wide before bringing it down,

01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:32.110
the slow but powerful arc towards you, Beauregard.

01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:32.990
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Oh no.

01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:34.770
MARISHA: Oh, I can really see it coming!

01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:35.970
MATT: That is a 19 to hit?

01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.280
MARISHA: That misses.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.052
MATT: That does miss.
LAURA: You got more than 19?

01:32:39.052 --> 01:32:39.885
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:32:39.885 --> 01:32:41.386
MARISHA: My AC is 21, yo!

01:32:41.386 --> 01:32:43.191
LIAM: Mid- to high-level monk? Yeah, for sure.

01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:45.160
MATT: You get something on a miss?

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.860
MARISHA: I do. Preternatural Counter!

01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:51.817
MATT: All righty, go ahead and roll an attack.

01:32:51.817 --> 01:32:53.400
MARISHA: Oh wait,
do I get this for freesies?

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.798
I get to use this for free once with my--

01:32:55.798 --> 01:32:57.242
MATT: Yeah, it's spending--

01:32:57.242 --> 01:32:58.491
MARISHA: Ki points for future ones.

01:32:58.491 --> 01:33:00.940
TRAVIS: Seems like a thing.
MARISHA: Great, okay.

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:03.623
Those are both the same thing,

01:33:03.623 --> 01:33:06.742
which is 22 total!

01:33:06.742 --> 01:33:07.742
MATT: That hits.

01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:10.803
MARISHA: 14 damage.

01:33:10.803 --> 01:33:12.140
MATT: 14 damage.

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:12.973
TALIESIN: Fucker!

01:33:12.973 --> 01:33:13.880
MATT: All right, so he swings down

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.180
one heavy (crash) impact.

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.110
He hits the ground and as the dirt

01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:20.280
and rock and snow sprays upward,

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:23.116
Beauregard, at first you think is hit, Yasha,

01:33:23.116 --> 01:33:24.130
and all of a sudden you glance up

01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:26.370
and she's 10 feet up in the air,

01:33:26.370 --> 01:33:29.350
jumped just past it, and then comes down, whack,

01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:30.770
punching it in the face as she plummets

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:31.860
from it landing on the ground!

01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:32.693
ASHLEY: That's cool!

01:33:32.693 --> 01:33:34.630
MATT: It pulls the axe.
ASHLEY: That's pretty cool!

01:33:34.630 --> 01:33:36.140
MATT: Because it's a double-headed greataxe,

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:39.520
it pulls upward to try and strike you as you land.

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:40.353
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.520
MATT: With a natural one.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.397
(laughs)
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:33:44.397 --> 01:33:46.260
MATT: So that's a miss on the second strike.

01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.480
MARISHA: I just do one of those sidesteps.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.950
Just like, as it just goes back up.

01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:51.783
MATT: Okay.

01:33:51.783 --> 01:33:52.616
MARISHA: Super chill.

01:33:52.616 --> 01:33:53.800
MATT: All right, that finishes its go.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.950
MARISHA: It missed me again though, right?

01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:55.830
MATT: It did.

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:59.260
MARISHA: Uh, ki point, right?

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.649
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Preternatural Counter.

01:34:00.649 --> 01:34:01.632
MATT: You can do that.

01:34:01.632 --> 01:34:03.720
You can buy an extra reaction once per turn.

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.460
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:09.143
MARISHA: Oh, those are both 14s,

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.900
which puts me at a 26.

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:14.270
Nope, that's the wrong one, but I'll take that.

01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:16.211
26 plus a four.

01:34:16.211 --> 01:34:17.889
So a 30 total.
MATT: That hits.

01:34:17.889 --> 01:34:18.722
Go ahead and roll damage.

01:34:18.722 --> 01:34:22.310
MARISHA: And I rolled an eight, so I'll take that 15 points.

01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:23.166
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:34:23.166 --> 01:34:26.395
(cheering)

01:34:26.395 --> 01:34:28.370
MARISHA: (sighs)

01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:30.720
Oh my god. Well, okay.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:33.400
So I landed and it tries to come up one more time?

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.200
MATT: Swing upward, get you with a back swing upward

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.400
to try and cleave you from sternum to top of head,

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.060
just (whoosh)

01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:45.060
MARISHA: Um, huh, as it lifts up,

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.580
I'm just going to take my staff

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.920
and use it right

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:52.480
in that rib, armpit, soft spot.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.322
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:34:53.322 --> 01:34:54.970
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to take my staff

01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:57.090
and just jam it through him into his innards.

01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:59.000
MATT: Okay, as he pulls up and exposes it

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.520
and as you jam it through, there's a faint bit

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.940
of blue light on the inside.

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:04.570
Some sort of like frozen necrotic energy

01:35:04.570 --> 01:35:06.130
that's keeping it animated

01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:08.520
and as you push your staff in-between the ribs,

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:11.040
into that centerpiece, you feel some resistance

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.770
and then there's a clicking impact

01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:14.420
and, as it does, you all watch

01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:16.370
as the darkened interior

01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:18.953
of its ribcage suddenly lights up brightly.

01:35:18.953 --> 01:35:21.880
Whoosh! And as it does, you see it react.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.680
And then, just (boom) clatter

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.230
into a pile of rotted bones as you withdraw

01:35:26.230 --> 01:35:29.438
and land next to it, destroyed!

01:35:29.438 --> 01:35:30.554
TRAVIS: Nice!

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:33.080
LIAM: Caleb is pulling his coat off

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.810
and walking up to the sloth and just sort of

01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:37.550
keeping it from walking away.

01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:38.717
TALIESIN: Hey, fuck up that sloth!
TRAVIS: Hey, hey!

01:35:38.717 --> 01:35:41.220
LIAM: Not that fast! Don't touch the sloth!

01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:43.576
TRAVIS: That's a good animal to choose. It's slow as shit.

01:35:43.576 --> 01:35:44.800
ASHLEY: It's really good.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.030
MATT: Especially in heavy snow.

01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:47.013
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)

01:35:47.013 --> 01:35:48.680
ASHLEY: Should we just like chuck it?

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.630
LIAM: No!
TRAVIS: No.

01:35:49.630 --> 01:35:53.920
LIAM: No, Essek, can we call in some of your people

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.550
and have them run it, oh, I don't know, 25 minutes away

01:35:57.550 --> 01:36:00.700
and leave it at the bottom of another crevice?

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.820
MATT: "I think that can be arranged."

01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:04.280
He pulls into his pocket and pulls out the stone

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.170
and you hear him mutter underneath it.

01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:09.262
LIAM: It's an hour.
LAURA: It's an hour.

01:36:09.262 --> 01:36:10.651
MATT: It's Polymorph.

01:36:10.651 --> 01:36:12.639
LAURA: Wow, right! I do it all the time.

01:36:12.639 --> 01:36:13.564
MATT: Yeah!
LAURA: I would know.

01:36:13.564 --> 01:36:15.002
TRAVIS: It's okay, you're frozen.

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.080
LAURA: I'm frozen!
LIAM: We flew across--

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.089
MATT: Which you are not anymore.

01:36:17.089 --> 01:36:18.873
MATT: It's end of their turn. You are now un-paralyzed.

01:36:18.873 --> 01:36:20.192
LAURA: Yay!
TRAVIS: Hey!

01:36:20.192 --> 01:36:21.842
LAURA: Oh my god!
SAM: Are you okay?

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.200
LAURA: What?
SAM: Are you okay?

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.083
LAURA: Oh, hi, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Hey.

01:36:25.083 --> 01:36:26.726
LAURA: Oh hi, Nott.
MATT: This does effectively--

01:36:26.726 --> 01:36:27.657
LAURA: Veth, I'm sorry!
MATT: -- end combat.

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:31.370
SAM: No, it's okay. Fjord saved your life.

01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:32.861
LIAM: "Oh, hi Mark."
SAM: He bundled you up

01:36:32.861 --> 01:36:34.500
and carried you to safety.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.860
It was very brave.

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.286
LAURA: You did?
TRAVIS: Kiss me.

01:36:38.954 --> 01:36:40.886
(lips smack)
(moans)

01:36:40.886 --> 01:36:41.719
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:36:41.719 --> 01:36:42.638
SAM: I'm going to Mage Hand

01:36:42.638 --> 01:36:45.972
and just feel up Fjord while he's doing it.

01:36:45.972 --> 01:36:48.804
TRAVIS: (muffled) Jester, what are you doing?

01:36:48.804 --> 01:36:51.666
(yells)
(laughter)

01:36:51.666 --> 01:36:53.100
SAM: Making things interesting.

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.420
TRAVIS: Was that you?
MATT: So Caleb,

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:56.153
while this is happening, Essek is next to you with

01:36:56.153 --> 01:36:59.103
the sending stone in his hand just going,

01:36:59.103 --> 01:37:00.782
"All right.

01:37:02.124 --> 01:37:03.616
"Interesting folk."

01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.121
Glancing past the whole this thing happening over there.

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:08.221
LAURA: (laughs)

01:37:08.221 --> 01:37:09.570
MATT: "They'll be here shortly."

01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:11.740
And as you all begin to convene and gather,

01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.540
you can see the rest of the rangers are beginning

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.640
to come over this way

01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:18.260
with Dagen and the other ranger leader approaching.

01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:21.060
Essek points to the sloth and

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:24.952
immediately Dagen goes, "What the hell is that doing here?"

01:37:24.952 --> 01:37:27.817
LIAM: (stammers) It's hard to explain.

01:37:27.817 --> 01:37:28.670
If you punch that thing,

01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:31.650
it's going to turn into an undead giant.

01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:35.058
So I want you to pick it up and spend 20 to 25 minutes--

01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:36.182
MARISHA: Don't punch the sloth!

01:37:36.182 --> 01:37:38.450
LIAM: -- hustling it away, and then put it down

01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:40.157
at the bottom of a ditch or something.

01:37:40.157 --> 01:37:42.005
LAURA: Is it a sloth?

01:37:42.005 --> 01:37:45.212
LIAM: No, this is a large rat.
LAURA: (gasps)

01:37:45.212 --> 01:37:46.989
LIAM: Very--
LAURA: I really love rats!

01:37:46.989 --> 01:37:50.110
LIAM: Um, but this one has a bad personality.

01:37:50.110 --> 01:37:52.120
Will you take this and go please quickly?

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.490
MATT: Dagen takes a satchel and wraps it up

01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:57.270
and holds it and lifts it onto the side of his chair

01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:59.660
and glances over, "Fucking magic."

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:02.363
TRAVIS: But to be clear, don't let it be hurt in any way.

01:38:02.363 --> 01:38:03.650
TALIESIN: Don't drop it or throw it down.

01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:04.750
TRAVIS: It will revert to something

01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:06.480
that will destroy you very quickly.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.117
TALIESIN: Yeah, just drop it and run.

01:38:09.117 --> 01:38:11.833
Gently. Put it down, yeah.
LIAM: It's on his shoulder going--

01:38:11.833 --> 01:38:13.075
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:38:13.075 --> 01:38:14.690
MATT: He glances over and the ranger glances back at him

01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:15.990
and they both give a knowing nod

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:20.627
and they both together smile and Dagen goes,

01:38:20.627 --> 01:38:24.364
"I think I saw just the ravine for this one."

01:38:24.364 --> 01:38:25.197
LAURA: Aww!

01:38:25.197 --> 01:38:27.310
SAM: This is a no kill extermination, right?

01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:28.738
We're good.

01:38:28.738 --> 01:38:30.658
TRAVIS: (laughs) "No kill."

01:38:30.658 --> 01:38:33.688
MATT: (as Dagen) "If this is an
undead giant, it's already dead."

01:38:33.688 --> 01:38:35.567
SAM: Okay, okay, good.

01:38:35.567 --> 01:38:36.504
MATT: "I'll take care of it."

01:38:36.504 --> 01:38:38.250
And he goes and starts heading off

01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:41.992
as it's like fighting its way very slowly in the bag.

01:38:41.992 --> 01:38:45.070
(slow groans)

01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:47.957
LIAM: It's actually a monk, too. It's just really slow.

01:38:47.957 --> 01:38:49.340
(laughter)

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:52.316
TRAVIS: Give me 10 hours. I'll get it.
LAURA: They do bite! They do bite!

01:38:52.316 --> 01:38:53.248
TRAVIS: They do.

01:38:53.248 --> 01:38:55.010
MATT: "(understanding groan)," he says

01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:57.338
as he continues to head off with it.

01:38:57.338 --> 01:38:59.008
Another one of the rangers accompanies,

01:38:59.008 --> 01:39:00.370
just to make sure that they have a team

01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:01.239
heading out that direction.

01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:03.333
LAURA: They bite just like you, huh, Sprinkle?

01:39:03.333 --> 01:39:04.902
SAM: Oh, Sprinkle's fine!

01:39:04.902 --> 01:39:06.262
LAURA: This guy's just fine!

01:39:06.262 --> 01:39:07.539
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) "I [inaudible] death!"
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:39:07.539 --> 01:39:08.875
LIAM: Oh, his jaw fell off.

01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.573
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) "Take me with him!"

01:39:10.573 --> 01:39:12.480
MATT: You see Sprinkle currently has a bunch

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.880
of ice caked in the fur

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:17.962
and is sitting there like (shivering).

01:39:17.962 --> 01:39:19.319
TRAVIS: "Show me the ravine!"

01:39:19.319 --> 01:39:20.567
(laughter)

01:39:20.567 --> 01:39:22.448
LAURA: You'll go here!
SAM: Put me in the bag, too!

01:39:22.448 --> 01:39:24.710
LAURA: I'll put him down my jacket so he's covered up more.

01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:26.682
MATT: Okay, curls up to warm inside.

01:39:26.682 --> 01:39:28.157
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) "Make it end!"

01:39:28.157 --> 01:39:31.160
(laughter)

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.411
(as Sprinkle) "I've lived too long!"

01:39:32.411 --> 01:39:35.650
(laughing)

01:39:35.650 --> 01:39:37.800
MATT: The rangers scatter to their respective perimeters

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.800
and you all are now gathered on the outskirts

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:42.900
of the entrance into Aeor itself.

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:43.733
What would you like to do?

01:39:43.733 --> 01:39:47.115
TRAVIS: We'll probably heal Jester
because you've got, like, what?

01:39:47.115 --> 01:39:48.219
12 or 14?

01:39:48.219 --> 01:39:50.500
LAURA: I've got a few, I've-- I'm a little,

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:53.321
I'm a little messed up right now, but I'm fine!

01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:54.688
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:56.760
LIAM: We've cleared the door, we could--

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.780
No one knows this place exists as far as we know,

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:02.300
we could just take a moment here, yeah?

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.215
Catch your breath?

01:40:04.215 --> 01:40:05.048
LAURA: I mean--

01:40:05.048 --> 01:40:08.373
LIAM: Rather than burn your energy.

01:40:08.373 --> 01:40:09.206
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:40:09.206 --> 01:40:10.097
SAM: Sure, take a rest.

01:40:10.097 --> 01:40:12.500
TALIESIN: Let's get a few feet inside maybe and--

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.210
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:40:14.210 --> 01:40:15.460
LIAM: There's always the off-chance

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:18.030
that my old friends are going to come up from the rear.

01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:20.640
So I'm just thinking of, just--

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.490
TALIESIN: Actually--
ASHLEY: That's right!

01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:23.870
LIAM: Just being ready, just in case.

01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:24.990
TALIESIN: Let's--
LIAM: As much as possible.

01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:26.790
TALIESIN: That way, actually, if we stop here,

01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:29.090
we can keep an eye on everything.

01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:32.020
So yeah, maybe not going inside is the way to go.

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.516
SAM: How big is the entrance that we came in?

01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:36.960
MATT: The entrance that Caduceus found?

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.113
TRAVIS: Two by four.
SAM: Yeah.

01:40:38.113 --> 01:40:39.760
MATT: It's it's about two feet wide and about four,

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.530
four and a half feet tall.
SAM: And that's it?

01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:44.150
MATT: Well, that's as far as anyone's gone.

01:40:44.150 --> 01:40:44.983
SAM: Oh.

01:40:44.983 --> 01:40:46.080
TRAVIS: We do have the benefit of you--

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.990
MATT: Yeah, you all were stepping towards it

01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.973
when you were attacked.

01:40:48.973 --> 01:40:49.893
SAM: We're still outside?

01:40:49.893 --> 01:40:51.868
MATT: You're still-- this is outside.
SAM: Oh!

01:40:51.868 --> 01:40:53.714
SAM: I thought this was like inside the cave.

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:54.547
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

01:40:54.547 --> 01:40:56.635
SAM: I don't know! I don't listen much.

01:40:56.635 --> 01:40:57.870
(laughter)

01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:59.120
Real boring story, Matt.

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.100
MATT: I know.

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:02.060
LIAM: But you're talking like White Rabbit rabbit hole?

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:04.563
This thing is shrinking down and in this passage?

01:41:04.563 --> 01:41:06.664
TALIESIN: We can't see past the opening.

01:41:06.664 --> 01:41:09.410
MATT: Just the dark entrance, the crack in the ice.

01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:10.790
LIAM: Oh, understood.

01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:12.165
LIAM: It could widen out.
MATT: It could.

01:41:12.165 --> 01:41:13.789
LIAM: Could.

01:41:13.789 --> 01:41:14.622
Okay.

01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:18.053
TRAVIS: At least if we go inside, anyone that--

01:41:18.053 --> 01:41:19.900
I mean, they're not going to scry on us.

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.400
TALIESIN: Let's just-- There's that
little pocket where we can hide

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.570
and somebody can just keep-- I'll keep an eye out.

01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:26.600
SAM: Yeah, we'll just keep watch.

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.831
TALIESIN: Across the wall to see
if anyone's going to come down.

01:41:28.831 --> 01:41:30.110
TRAVIS: [Inaudible] go in.

01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:31.583
MATT: So are you taking a short rest?

01:41:31.583 --> 01:41:33.249
And you're taking it on the--
LIAM: We should.

01:41:33.249 --> 01:41:34.537
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

01:41:34.537 --> 01:41:37.100
LIAM: And I think if anyone's going to surprise us

01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:40.390
it's because they have eyes, physical eyes, on us now.

01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:41.920
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.753
LIAM: Anyway.

01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:46.930
MATT: So where are you taking your short rest?

01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:48.601
LAURA: Up against the crevice.

01:41:48.601 --> 01:41:49.895
MATT: All right, so you guys are all

01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:51.570
clustering into that space there.

01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:52.500
Okay.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.273
TRAVIS: We're, of course, wiping snow for these--

01:41:54.273 --> 01:41:57.130
TALIESIN: I was going to take a second to clear out--

01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:58.625
ASHLEY: Should we check them out at all?

01:41:58.625 --> 01:41:59.458
SAM: Oh, like--

01:41:59.458 --> 01:42:01.891
SAM: I can search the bodies.
ASHLEY: See what the blue thing is?

01:42:01.891 --> 01:42:03.700
SAM: Yeah, you search a body, I'll search a body.

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:04.754
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:42:04.754 --> 01:42:05.830
SAM: Unless you need to heal.

01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:07.670
ASHLEY: Investigate?
TALIESIN: Vibrate the ground a little bit

01:42:07.670 --> 01:42:10.410
to just get all the snow to even out.

01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:12.461
MATT: Over time it will, yeah, if you want to.

01:42:12.461 --> 01:42:14.585
It's a cantrip, so it's not extremely powerful.

01:42:14.585 --> 01:42:16.320
TALIESIN: Sure.
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, you look--

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.700
MATT: It's not going to get rid of giant tracks,

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.960
if that's what you're trying to do.

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.420
TALIESIN: Just thinning everything out a bit.

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:23.171
SAM: I'm searching the bodies.

01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:24.730
MATT: Okay.
SAM: And I've rolled a 32.

01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:25.738
MATT: 32.

01:42:25.738 --> 01:42:26.571
Um...

01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:29.220
they're pretty gross.

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:31.637
Though some of the grosser bits are at least frozen,

01:42:31.637 --> 01:42:32.920
which is nice.

01:42:34.682 --> 01:42:36.152
Not much of worth, actually.
SAM: Okay.

01:42:36.152 --> 01:42:39.090
MATT: Their weapons themselves are unusable by any of you.

01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:42.237
They're too large and a bit rudimentary

01:42:42.237 --> 01:42:44.263
and damaged by the elements.

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:46.488
Yeah, not much of use on them, unfortunately.

01:42:46.488 --> 01:42:48.860
SAM: No superior healing potions?

01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.179
MATT: Weirdly, no.
SAM: Okay, cool.

01:42:50.179 --> 01:42:51.360
MATT: It's like they didn't have anything

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.590
to heal themselves with originally.

01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:54.390
SAM: Cool, cool.
MATT: It's a problem.

01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:55.490
TALIESIN: You going to be okay? You need any--?

01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:56.465
Oh, you can just use--

01:42:56.465 --> 01:42:59.590
LAURA: I'm just going to use up some of my hit dice.

01:43:01.485 --> 01:43:03.870
TALIESIN: I think I need a short rest for some stuff anyway.

01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:05.128
MATT: Essek is going to take a short rest as well

01:43:05.128 --> 01:43:07.536
to regain a spell slot.

01:43:08.590 --> 01:43:10.871
LIAM: That frog miniature is too fucking cute.

01:43:10.871 --> 01:43:11.852
MARISHA: He's so cute!

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:12.790
MATT: (laughs)

01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:15.800
TRAVIS: If there was any large area
that was heavily disturbed,

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.870
I'll use Create Water to create a 30-foot cube

01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:21.130
of just snow, fresh snow.

01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:22.540
MATT: Okay, yeah, there are--

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:26.620
you can see where the giants were resting.

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:27.810
There were these mounds

01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:29.580
that you stepped over as you made your way here

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.610
and with them having lifted up, moved, and then fallen,

01:43:32.610 --> 01:43:35.818
they are now large piles of

01:43:35.818 --> 01:43:38.051
dead giant, re-dead giant,

01:43:38.051 --> 01:43:39.200
and in the spaces where they were,

01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.010
there's a slight concave space where they previously were.

01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:44.630
So you can refill that and cover them

01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:46.670
with one casting for each of them, if you'd like.

01:43:46.670 --> 01:43:47.530
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:48.363
MATT: Okay.

01:43:48.363 --> 01:43:50.280
TRAVIS: And then I'll take the short rest.

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.950
MATT: You got it.

01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:53.860
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.942
TALIESIN: Anything-- We see anything coming our way while--?

01:43:55.942 --> 01:43:58.504
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:43:58.504 --> 01:43:59.628
TRAVIS: ♪ Makin' my way ♪

01:43:59.628 --> 01:44:00.461
TALIESIN: ♪ Makin' my way ♪

01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:02.643
24.

01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:08.890
MATT: You spend a good portion of the time

01:44:08.890 --> 01:44:11.090
for your friends to rest up, heal,

01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:13.640
catch their breath, prepare themselves

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:14.970
for delving into what you assume

01:44:14.970 --> 01:44:17.510
to be a lightless interior, an endless maze

01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:20.200
of whatever this city might've been

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.930
and as you glance out past the edge of the snow,

01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:27.010
as the ridge begins to slightly ascend

01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:28.460
into the space where you are,

01:44:30.967 --> 01:44:33.850
you see a cute little snow bunny,

01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:35.820
leaping from space to space.

01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:37.261
TALIESIN: How far away?

01:44:37.261 --> 01:44:38.727
MATT: About 200 feet from you.

01:44:38.727 --> 01:44:39.920
TALIESIN: 200 feet.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.899
So I can't hit it with Sacred Flame from here.

01:44:42.899 --> 01:44:44.691
MATT: No, you'd have to get closer.

01:44:44.691 --> 01:44:46.020
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep an eye on that bunny.

01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.344
MATT: Okay.

01:44:47.344 --> 01:44:48.478
TALIESIN: I don't trust that damn thing.

01:44:48.478 --> 01:44:50.390
MARISHA: I've seen Monty Python.

01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:51.790
TALIESIN: Fucking bunny.

01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:53.670
MATT: The bunny, eventually, you lose sight of,

01:44:53.670 --> 01:44:56.370
as it is now within a patch of deep snow

01:44:56.370 --> 01:44:57.830
and is no longer visible.

01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:00.280
TALIESIN: Anyone sees a bunny, just shoot on sight.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.115
LIAM: Where's Percy when you need him?
TALIESIN: Very suspicious.

01:45:02.115 --> 01:45:03.064
(laughter)

01:45:03.064 --> 01:45:04.207
TRAVIS: 35, 35.

01:45:04.207 --> 01:45:07.190
TALIESIN: Percy is thinking, "Oh, new hat."

01:45:07.190 --> 01:45:09.252
TRAVIS: Before my short rest, I was using--
MARISHA: "Percy is thinking 'New hat'?"

01:45:09.252 --> 01:45:11.710
TRAVIS: -- 5th-level Cure Wounds.
LAURA: 5th-level?!

01:45:11.710 --> 01:45:13.659
LIAM: Mittens for my wife.
TRAVIS: Short rest, I get everything back.

01:45:13.659 --> 01:45:14.902
LAURA: Okay.

01:45:14.902 --> 01:45:16.393
TRAVIS: I'm going to use a 5th-level Cure Wounds on Jester.

01:45:16.393 --> 01:45:18.754
She got 35 points back along with her hit dice.

01:45:18.754 --> 01:45:20.780
LAURA: That's great because I just-- yeah.

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:23.830
Let me see because maybe I'll take one-- it doesn't--

01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:24.663
13.

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.171
That'll get me back up to full health.

01:45:29.171 --> 01:45:31.750
But I used all of my hit dice.

01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:33.533
MATT: Okay, there you go.

01:45:33.533 --> 01:45:34.724
Good to note.

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:37.563
All right.

01:45:37.563 --> 01:45:39.810
LIAM: You're stomping to get the circulation back

01:45:39.810 --> 01:45:42.250
in your feet and wriggling your fingers as much as possible.

01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:44.030
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:46.523
It really wasn't, like, painful cold, you know what I mean?

01:45:46.523 --> 01:45:48.770
LIAM: It looked terrible.
MARISHA: It did.

01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:50.020
LIAM: We thought you were dead.
ASHLEY: Yeah, horrifying.

01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.750
MARISHA: We thought you were going to be diamond dust.

01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:54.170
LAURA: I could see through the ice that was freezing me

01:45:54.170 --> 01:45:56.620
so I could see that the things were attacking me.

01:45:57.630 --> 01:45:59.460
MARISHA: What was it like when you were just doing,

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:02.280
just ass-over-kettle when you were in the air?

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.689
LAURA: I mean, it was just a lot of spinny

01:46:03.689 --> 01:46:05.393
and then all of a sudden I saw Fjord.

01:46:06.682 --> 01:46:08.180
TRAVIS: (snickers)

01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:10.652
LIAM: That's what's at the end of the tunnel.

01:46:10.652 --> 01:46:11.913
LAURA: (laughs)

01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:17.794
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Fjord at the end of the tunnel.

01:46:17.794 --> 01:46:19.125
MARISHA: The Fjord at the tunnel.

01:46:19.125 --> 01:46:20.450
(laughter)

01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:22.100
LIAM: Good truck commercial copy.
TRAVIS: Thanks.

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:24.123
MATT: Yeah, yeah.
(laughter)

01:46:24.123 --> 01:46:25.989
TRAVIS: "The Ford at the end of the tunnel."
SAM: When you die,

01:46:25.989 --> 01:46:28.243
there's always a Ford there.

01:46:28.243 --> 01:46:30.165
TRAVIS: (gags)
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:46:30.165 --> 01:46:32.750
MATT: All right, at the end of your short rest

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:36.880
you feel yourselves steeled, hopefully, for what's ahead.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.730
One by one, you all begin to stand up,

01:46:38.730 --> 01:46:39.970
bundle yourselves, and prepare

01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:42.190
for the next leg of your journey.

01:46:42.190 --> 01:46:44.630
What's the marching order of entry?

01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:46.220
SAM: We need someone who can see in the dark.

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.760
TRAVIS: I can.

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.400
LAURA: Are you in front?
SAM: Did you say "fuck it"?

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:50.233
TRAVIS: No, I can.

01:46:50.233 --> 01:46:51.917
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: I really want to go in.

01:46:51.917 --> 01:46:53.091
SAM: Go in!
LAURA: Go in the front!

01:46:53.091 --> 01:46:54.255
TRAVIS: Wee!

01:46:54.255 --> 01:46:56.946
LIAM: I'll go second, actually.
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:46:56.946 --> 01:46:58.612
ASHLEY: I'll go third.
TRAVIS: I would prefer that, actually.

01:46:58.612 --> 01:46:59.790
TALIESIN: You should probably have someone checking--

01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:01.810
MARISHA: Check for traps?
TALIESIN: -- for traps.

01:47:01.810 --> 01:47:03.710
SAM: I'll go fifth, sure.

01:47:03.710 --> 01:47:05.050
No, I'll go up there, sure--

01:47:05.050 --> 01:47:06.450
TRAVIS: When we were in the Happy Fun Ball

01:47:06.450 --> 01:47:08.670
we did great with traps, I'm an old pro.

01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:09.886
MARISHA: That's true!
SAM: Yeah, go for it, you're fine!

01:47:09.886 --> 01:47:11.150
MARISHA: It was great.
TALIESIN: All right, then I'll go next.

01:47:11.150 --> 01:47:14.366
MARISHA: She just kicked a door inward until it...

01:47:14.366 --> 01:47:15.610
worked.
LIAM: Out to the universe.

01:47:15.610 --> 01:47:17.285
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:47:17.285 --> 01:47:20.880
MARISHA: It was fun!
TRAVIS: Forever changed the universe.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.051
MARISHA: Fabric of reality.

01:47:22.051 --> 01:47:23.480
TRAVIS: Oh, who needs that?
MARISHA: Kicked it in.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.313
MATT: All right.

01:47:24.313 --> 01:47:25.592
TRAVIS: Mapped corridor, goodbye.

01:47:25.592 --> 01:47:27.727
LAURA: I do think you should go up
at the front and look for traps.

01:47:27.727 --> 01:47:29.413
MATT: All right, so we have Fjord.

01:47:29.413 --> 01:47:31.338
LIAM: That's a good idea.
MATT: Fjord, then Caleb.

01:47:31.338 --> 01:47:32.540
LAURA: I think--
MATT: Then Yasha?

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:34.566
LAURA: Veth, second.
SAM: I'm being peer pressured.

01:47:34.566 --> 01:47:36.723
LIAM: We are volunteering Veth for us.

01:47:36.723 --> 01:47:39.071
MATT: All right, Veth is second in the order.

01:47:39.071 --> 01:47:40.345
Then Caleb.

01:47:41.228 --> 01:47:42.710
Yasha.

01:47:42.710 --> 01:47:43.950
SAM: I probably need some--
LAURA: Night vision.

01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:45.110
SAM: I need some light or else all

01:47:45.110 --> 01:47:47.763
of my checks will be at disadvantage, I think.

01:47:47.763 --> 01:47:49.100
TRAVIS: My sword glows.

01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:49.933
SAM: Great!

01:47:49.933 --> 01:47:52.530
TALIESIN: I pop my staff to make a little light as well.

01:47:52.530 --> 01:47:53.430
MATT: Okay.

01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:54.490
Essek's going to hang in front of you,

01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:59.440
behind Yasha and then we have Beau and Jester at the end.

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:01.310
Who's going last? Who's caboose?

01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:02.910
MARISHA: I'll go last.

01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:03.743
MATT: All right.

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:06.480
MARISHA: I'll put on my goggles.
TRAVIS: -- be the caboose.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.640
MARISHA: And keep looking over my shoulder as I go.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:11.100
MATT: You've got it. Okay.

01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:16.100
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep my sword out and guide with my--

01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:18.420
MATT: It does give you a bit of a glow in the radius.

01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:20.100
ASHLEY: Little bit of glow.

01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:21.668
MATT: All righty, so.

01:48:21.668 --> 01:48:23.930
ASHLEY, TALIESIN, TRAVIS, and LAURA: (light saber noises)

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:26.760
MATT: One by one, you begin to squeeze your way

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.280
into this lightless interior,

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:34.038
pushing into this very tight, rocky,

01:48:34.038 --> 01:48:34.879
entranceway.

01:48:34.879 --> 01:48:36.950
(laughter)

01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:38.530
ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way! ♪
MARISHA: I was waiting for it.

01:48:38.530 --> 01:48:40.247
TRAVIS: Goddamn it!
MARISHA: Waiting for it!

01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:43.116
MATT: And with that, we'll take a break, I guess.

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:44.510
(laughter)

01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:46.606
TRAVIS: Worthless!

01:48:46.606 --> 01:48:47.569
Horrible!

01:48:47.569 --> 01:48:49.088
TALIESIN: Felt it snap!

01:48:49.088 --> 01:48:50.795
MATT: Oh boy!

01:48:50.795 --> 01:48:52.240
(laughs)
SAM: Wow.

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:55.048
LIAM: Pushing into a tight place.

01:48:55.913 --> 01:48:57.138
LAURA: Sorry.

01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:59.610
MATT: Love you, Laura.

01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:01.930
All right, we'll be back here in a few minutes

01:49:01.930 --> 01:49:04.530
to pick up for the second half of today's adventure.

01:49:05.869 --> 01:49:07.518
(ominous groaning)

01:49:07.518 --> 01:49:10.351
(chains rattling)

01:49:13.911 --> 01:49:16.161
(thudding)

01:49:17.271 --> 01:49:20.249
(thudding)
(breathing heavily)

01:49:20.249 --> 01:49:25.249
(beast growling)
(groaning)

01:49:39.494 --> 01:49:42.494
(breathing heavily)

01:49:45.989 --> 01:49:49.656
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:49:53.547 --> 01:49:56.880
(chanting indistinctly)

01:50:03.305 --> 01:50:05.555
(rumbling)

01:50:29.107 --> 01:50:31.357
(thudding)

01:50:38.487 --> 01:50:40.737
(grunting)

01:50:43.239 --> 01:50:45.989
(metal clanging)

01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:13.236
(roaring)

01:51:16.523 --> 01:51:18.773
(growling)

01:51:26.826 --> 01:51:29.435
(thudding)

01:51:29.435 --> 01:51:31.685
(growling)

01:51:35.116 --> 01:51:37.449
(squealing)

01:51:41.707 --> 01:51:44.540
(arrows twanging)

01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:07.260
(fire crackling)

01:52:15.046 --> 01:52:17.213
(roaring)

01:52:29.937 --> 01:52:34.520
(roaring)
(squealing)

01:52:41.344 --> 01:52:42.764
This is everything you need to know

01:52:42.764 --> 01:52:45.364
about our terrain in 60 seconds.

01:52:45.364 --> 01:52:48.754
We hand sculpt our pieces for maximum detail and artistry,

01:52:48.754 --> 01:52:51.714
infusing passion into every millimeter of our work.

01:52:51.714 --> 01:52:53.774
Everything is available beautifully hand painted

01:52:53.774 --> 01:52:55.524
so you can start playing right away,

01:52:55.524 --> 01:52:58.284
or you can choose unpainted to paint everything yourself.

01:52:58.284 --> 01:53:00.564
Our pieces are completely modular so you can use

01:53:00.564 --> 01:53:03.464
the same sets to create a new adventure every time.

01:53:03.464 --> 01:53:05.474
We create everything out of Dwarvenite,

01:53:05.474 --> 01:53:09.264
our top secret PVC formula, that's nearly indestructible.

01:53:09.264 --> 01:53:12.124
We pack our pieces with as many features as possible,

01:53:12.124 --> 01:53:14.614
such as swap-able LEDs to quickly change

01:53:14.614 --> 01:53:15.704
the look of your scene.

01:53:15.704 --> 01:53:17.954
We offer magnetic accessories to add flavor,

01:53:17.954 --> 01:53:19.474
or increase the danger.

01:53:19.474 --> 01:53:22.634
A one inch tactical grid is sculpted into our floors.

01:53:22.634 --> 01:53:24.184
We offer a range of environments

01:53:24.184 --> 01:53:27.174
including dungeons, cavern, cities, castles, sewers,

01:53:27.174 --> 01:53:30.334
forests, mountains, streets, burrows, ice, and hellscape.

01:53:30.334 --> 01:53:32.384
And that's just the beginning.

01:53:32.384 --> 01:53:33.954
That's everything you need to know

01:53:33.954 --> 01:53:36.567
about Dwarven Forge in 60 seconds.

01:53:36.567 --> 01:53:41.567
(thudding)
(evil laughter)

01:53:41.684 --> 01:53:45.774
Sam, could you go down to the lower room where you are?

01:53:45.774 --> 01:53:46.684
Could you go downstairs right now

01:53:46.684 --> 01:53:48.034
and get me some blood bags?

01:53:48.974 --> 01:53:50.644
Yeah go work on the, your audition

01:53:50.644 --> 01:53:52.324
for rockabilly Guitar Hero.

01:53:52.324 --> 01:53:53.937
Coming up via elevator.

01:53:57.284 --> 01:54:00.044
Brian, I want you to keep raking him for his facial hair,

01:54:00.044 --> 01:54:03.454
but I gotta be honest, I really like it.

01:54:03.454 --> 01:54:05.594
I kinda like, it's better than just the stash.

01:54:05.594 --> 01:54:07.154
Just the stash was--

01:54:07.154 --> 01:54:08.314
Yeah, not good.
We had issues with it.

01:54:08.314 --> 01:54:11.244
This is great, we all like it.

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:13.604
So I think will stay for awhile.

01:54:13.604 --> 01:54:14.437
I know.

01:54:14.437 --> 01:54:16.484
And the way it came about was so true.

01:54:16.484 --> 01:54:18.174
I don't know what's going on right now though.

01:54:18.174 --> 01:54:20.884
I can stand, I can dance, I can do whatever.

01:54:20.884 --> 01:54:21.717
Okay.

01:54:22.894 --> 01:54:25.194
Okay.
This is so stupid.

01:54:25.194 --> 01:54:27.624
Why, are you, why don't you just bring in your Peloton

01:54:27.624 --> 01:54:28.534
and do the show on that?

01:54:28.534 --> 01:54:29.914
Oh, that's a great idea!

01:54:29.914 --> 01:54:31.444
You could've just set the webcam on the--

01:54:31.444 --> 01:54:33.324
Yeah, webcam on the screen, sure.

01:54:33.324 --> 01:54:36.044
If you ever have me back, I'm doing it all on the Peloton.

01:54:36.044 --> 01:54:37.534
No!
100%, I'm gonna do--

01:54:37.534 --> 01:54:39.454
You got Danny shaking no.

01:54:39.454 --> 01:54:42.224
I'm gonna do the entire episode--

01:54:42.224 --> 01:54:43.852
That's a series wrap.

01:54:43.852 --> 01:54:46.984
While biking, I swear to god.

01:54:46.984 --> 01:54:51.632
(suspenseful orchestral music)

01:54:51.632 --> 01:54:54.799
(typewriter clacking)

01:55:16.914 --> 01:55:18.964
Hey critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:55:18.964 --> 01:55:21.429
Let's see what's up in the Critical Roles shop.

01:55:21.429 --> 01:55:24.134
(playful 80s music)

01:55:24.134 --> 01:55:25.787
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

01:55:27.929 --> 01:55:29.761
(dice rolling)

01:55:29.761 --> 01:55:31.034
I mean the traveler always says

01:55:31.034 --> 01:55:34.111
impulse purchases are a good decision.

01:55:34.111 --> 01:55:36.204
(pencils clattering)

01:55:36.204 --> 01:55:38.224
Can you put donuts in this?

01:55:38.224 --> 01:55:39.667
Only one way to find out.

01:55:40.911 --> 01:55:42.604
(high five slapping)

01:55:42.604 --> 01:55:43.854
Roll an investigation if you want,

01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:48.414
it's basically perfect.
(thunder rumbling)

01:55:48.414 --> 01:55:50.324
This is, this is a lot of stuff, you guys.

01:55:50.324 --> 01:55:52.827
We have like so many cool things right now.

01:55:54.903 --> 01:55:55.736
(mouse clicking)

01:55:55.736 --> 01:55:57.867
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

01:55:57.867 --> 01:55:59.794
(laughs) Don't worry, there's a few more minutes

01:55:59.794 --> 01:56:01.444
in the break, you still got time.

01:56:03.118 --> 01:56:06.201
(relaxed jazz music)

01:56:07.304 --> 01:56:08.714
Hello, everyone.

01:56:08.714 --> 01:56:11.954 line:20%
It's me, Marisha Ray, creative director

01:56:11.954 --> 01:56:13.884 line:20%
for Critical Role content.

01:56:13.884 --> 01:56:15.984 line:20%
And I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

01:56:15.984 --> 01:56:19.074 line:20%
about how much we appreciate your support.

01:56:19.074 --> 01:56:23.474
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

01:56:23.474 --> 01:56:24.634
Over the past five years,

01:56:24.634 --> 01:56:27.324
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

01:56:27.324 --> 01:56:30.744
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

01:56:30.744 --> 01:56:34.914
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes,

01:56:34.914 --> 01:56:36.784
and putting our loyal employees

01:56:36.784 --> 01:56:38.644
in slightly embarrassing situations,

01:56:38.644 --> 01:56:41.784
eagerly hoping that we've captured your attention.

01:56:41.784 --> 01:56:45.294
Today, I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

01:56:45.294 --> 01:56:49.914
written by Brian W. Foster, or dressing Sam as a celebrity

01:56:49.914 --> 01:56:53.774
to recreate an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

01:56:53.774 --> 01:56:56.744
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch prime account

01:56:56.744 --> 01:56:59.554
requires you to resubscribe each month.

01:56:59.554 --> 01:57:02.954
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag,

01:57:02.954 --> 01:57:05.484
or have to put Matt in cosplay to tell you

01:57:05.484 --> 01:57:08.504
that you can easily give subscriptions to fellow critters

01:57:08.504 --> 01:57:10.214
if you're feeling generous.

01:57:10.214 --> 01:57:14.084
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

01:57:14.084 --> 01:57:16.104
shooting complicated parody promos

01:57:16.104 --> 01:57:19.094
featuring Taliesin Jaffe as a vintage spooky boy

01:57:19.094 --> 01:57:22.574
in full monochromatic glory all in the hope

01:57:22.574 --> 01:57:25.347
that your smile may turn into a sub.

01:57:26.434 --> 01:57:27.577
But not today.

01:57:28.624 --> 01:57:33.247 line:20%
No weird graphics, no puppet murder, no Sam Riegal.

01:57:38.334 --> 01:57:42.957
It's just me, here to say thank you.

01:57:44.464 --> 01:57:45.297
Love you all.

01:57:46.924 --> 01:57:47.757
Good night.

02:09:47.549 --> 02:09:49.066
MATT: Welcome back.

02:09:49.066 --> 02:09:50.986
So, Mighty Nein,

02:09:52.479 --> 02:09:54.299
one by one,

02:09:54.299 --> 02:09:59.169
you've squeezed into the small entryway to these ruins.

02:09:59.169 --> 02:10:01.009
MARISHA: Ah, that's right.

02:10:01.009 --> 02:10:02.333
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:10:02.333 --> 02:10:04.639
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:10:04.639 --> 02:10:06.514
Sorry.
ASHLEY: (laughs)

02:10:06.514 --> 02:10:08.362
MATT: It's okay.
SAM: Plunge into the dark depths.

02:10:08.362 --> 02:10:09.959
MATT: Indeed.

02:10:09.959 --> 02:10:12.299
Within the lightless interior, some of you

02:10:12.299 --> 02:10:16.299
carrying with you your faint bits of light source

02:10:16.299 --> 02:10:18.112
to keep visual.

02:10:20.079 --> 02:10:23.169
You are met with heavily damaged and partially collapsed

02:10:23.169 --> 02:10:25.909
walls and impacted natural stone,

02:10:25.909 --> 02:10:29.472
as it opens up about 20 or so feet inward.

02:10:30.679 --> 02:10:33.629
You can see now, as the ceiling rises

02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:36.679
about 15, 20 feet above,

02:10:36.679 --> 02:10:39.662
jagged icicles that drag down from the ceiling.

02:10:40.559 --> 02:10:42.972
The ceiling itself, uneven and broken,

02:10:43.819 --> 02:10:45.399
meeting the ground at certain angles

02:10:45.399 --> 02:10:48.539
where you can see the stone collapse has barely held at bay,

02:10:48.539 --> 02:10:51.539
and you have to push past these nearly enclosed

02:10:51.539 --> 02:10:52.802
portions of the hall.

02:10:54.009 --> 02:10:57.969
Eventually moving on until about 150 or so feet in,

02:10:57.969 --> 02:11:00.442
there is but a crawl space to continue.

02:11:02.329 --> 02:11:05.850
Do you take the same order of people?

02:11:07.739 --> 02:11:09.179
TALIESIN: Just--
LIAM: Yeah.

02:11:09.179 --> 02:11:10.479
SAM: Sure?
LIAM: I'll stay close

02:11:10.479 --> 02:11:11.963
to the front.
SAM: There's a crawl space?

02:11:11.963 --> 02:11:15.101
LAURA: How little is the crawl space?

02:11:15.101 --> 02:11:17.819
MATT: It's going to be a tough fit for

02:11:17.819 --> 02:11:19.886
probably Fjord and Yasha.

02:11:20.791 --> 02:11:22.359
LAURA: And Caduceus.
TALIESIN: I'm tall, but not wide.

02:11:22.359 --> 02:11:23.409
MATT: He's tall, but he's thin.

02:11:23.409 --> 02:11:26.689
So as long as you get down and crawl,

02:11:26.689 --> 02:11:29.739
you'll probably make it through without issue, but--

02:11:29.739 --> 02:11:31.678
MARISHA: Working out.
TRAVIS: Thanks.

02:11:31.678 --> 02:11:32.511
Thanks, coach.

02:11:32.511 --> 02:11:33.839
MATT: (laughs)

02:11:33.839 --> 02:11:36.069
LAURA: Do you want to put on some glasses

02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:38.542
and sneakle in first, or?

02:11:39.509 --> 02:11:43.812
SAM: Sure, or you can cast a bubble of light or something.

02:11:44.754 --> 02:11:46.599
TALIESIN: Glasses may be the way to go.

02:11:46.599 --> 02:11:47.445
LIAM: Yeah, I think so.

02:11:47.445 --> 02:11:48.964
SAM: Oh shit, I dropped--

02:11:48.964 --> 02:11:50.129
TALIESIN: Keep it.

02:11:50.129 --> 02:11:53.002
SAM: Uh, sure, I'll wear the glasses and I'll go first.

02:11:54.029 --> 02:11:54.862
MATT: Okay.

02:11:57.079 --> 02:11:57.979
As you begin to--

02:11:57.979 --> 02:11:59.349
SAM: Searching for traps.

02:11:59.349 --> 02:12:01.359
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check for me,

02:12:01.359 --> 02:12:02.249
if you don't mind.

02:12:02.249 --> 02:12:04.896
SAM: 19 plus 13, 32.

02:12:04.896 --> 02:12:07.849
LIAM: Oh!

02:12:07.849 --> 02:12:08.682
MATT: All right.

02:12:10.489 --> 02:12:14.582
You continue on this narrow, shadowed path.

02:12:16.329 --> 02:12:20.809
It begins to curve slightly before continuing forward

02:12:20.809 --> 02:12:23.062
for another 60 or 70 feet.

02:12:26.139 --> 02:12:27.732
And then it just drops off.

02:12:30.239 --> 02:12:32.359
It just ends.

02:12:32.359 --> 02:12:34.399
And you have the darkvision goggles on, right?

02:12:34.399 --> 02:12:35.399
SAM: I do.
MATT: What's the radius

02:12:35.399 --> 02:12:36.429
on those goggles?

02:12:36.429 --> 02:12:38.409
SAM: Probably 30 or 60, right?
MARISHA: Seems like 60,

02:12:38.409 --> 02:12:40.159
yeah, darkvision 60 feet, something like that.

02:12:40.159 --> 02:12:41.799
MATT: 60 feet.

02:12:41.799 --> 02:12:45.339
You can see across this collapse in this region.

02:12:45.339 --> 02:12:49.729
It looks like there are other elements of stone

02:12:49.729 --> 02:12:52.882
and previously-laid cavern that have broken in.

02:12:52.882 --> 02:12:55.839
It is a jam of boulders that are blocking off

02:12:55.839 --> 02:12:57.189
partway ahead. But right here,

02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:59.889
the ground just ends and drops

02:12:59.889 --> 02:13:02.249
into darkness that you can't see.

02:13:02.249 --> 02:13:07.249
And across the way, it just comes to this broken wall

02:13:07.289 --> 02:13:09.589
of scattered stone and slate.

02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:10.909
SAM: How far away is the other wall?

02:13:10.909 --> 02:13:13.050
MATT: Other wall is about 15, 20 feet from you.

02:13:13.050 --> 02:13:13.941
SAM: Oh.

02:13:13.941 --> 02:13:16.489
But there's no clear entrance?

02:13:16.489 --> 02:13:19.199
MATT: There's no other viable way to really go,

02:13:19.199 --> 02:13:22.289
aside from through the rock or down the pit.

02:13:22.289 --> 02:13:24.809
With your investigation check, what you do find

02:13:26.729 --> 02:13:30.159
are signs of long-abandoned climbing gear

02:13:30.159 --> 02:13:32.839
as well as two pitons,

02:13:32.839 --> 02:13:35.129
as they're called--
SAM: "Pittins."

02:13:35.129 --> 02:13:37.342
MATT: -- driven into the stone, long ago.

02:13:37.342 --> 02:13:40.747
And you can see a single ice-coated rope that angles--

02:13:40.747 --> 02:13:43.489
SAM: On our side of?
MATT: On your side, that descends

02:13:43.489 --> 02:13:45.639
into the darkness below.

02:13:45.639 --> 02:13:47.559
SAM: Okay. And you guys are with me, right?

02:13:47.559 --> 02:13:49.024
You didn't send me by myself, or?

02:13:49.024 --> 02:13:49.934
TRAVIS: You're by yourself.

02:13:49.934 --> 02:13:51.342
LIAM: You were a little ahead of us, so.

02:13:51.342 --> 02:13:52.849
MATT: You turn around to say this and there's nobody there.

02:13:52.849 --> 02:13:54.852
SAM: Oh, shit!
TRAVIS: We close the hole.

02:13:54.852 --> 02:13:55.849
(laughter)

02:13:55.849 --> 02:13:56.957
SAM: Ah!

02:13:56.957 --> 02:13:58.359
TRAVIS: Fucking finally!

02:13:58.359 --> 02:14:00.864
Okay, Nicodranas?

02:14:00.864 --> 02:14:02.130
(laughter)

02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:04.673
MARISHA: The most elaborate ruse.

02:14:04.673 --> 02:14:06.499
TRAVIS: Jesus, those giants were unexpected.

02:14:06.499 --> 02:14:07.377
Let's go.

02:14:07.377 --> 02:14:09.460
(laughter)

02:14:11.719 --> 02:14:12.759
SAM: Is it stone?

02:14:12.759 --> 02:14:14.519
Is it ice?

02:14:14.519 --> 02:14:15.839
Stone?
MATT: It's a combination

02:14:15.839 --> 02:14:18.709
of the two. It looks like a lot of this interior,

02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:21.039
especially the crammed hall you first entered with,

02:14:21.039 --> 02:14:24.129
looks like rough stone that was pushed up from the impact

02:14:24.129 --> 02:14:25.779
of when the city crashed.

02:14:25.779 --> 02:14:28.012
So it's just odd angles

02:14:28.012 --> 02:14:32.249
of subterranean earth and rock

02:14:32.249 --> 02:14:34.749
and bedrock that have all been jammed and broken

02:14:34.749 --> 02:14:37.015
and have come to rest in a very

02:14:38.256 --> 02:14:41.049
haphazard stillness.

02:14:41.049 --> 02:14:44.319
And then ice has crept in, either also thrown into the mix

02:14:44.319 --> 02:14:46.649
from the impact or has since grown over it.

02:14:46.649 --> 02:14:47.869
So it is--
SAM: Okay.

02:14:47.869 --> 02:14:50.509
MATT: Right now you do not see any signs of a city.

02:14:50.509 --> 02:14:54.389
You're just seeing broken and refrozen

02:14:55.759 --> 02:14:57.359
earth and rock.

02:14:57.359 --> 02:15:00.169
SAM: All right, if there's any loose rock around,

02:15:00.169 --> 02:15:04.389
not big, just like, you know, size of a silver dollar--

02:15:04.389 --> 02:15:05.529
MATT: With your investigation check

02:15:05.529 --> 02:15:08.049
you can see there are a handful.

02:15:08.049 --> 02:15:10.159
There's none that are loose--
SAM: Oh.

02:15:10.159 --> 02:15:12.159
MATT: -- right now because of most of the frost that's here.

02:15:12.159 --> 02:15:13.859
There are a couple of small that are wedged

02:15:13.859 --> 02:15:15.046
into the sides of the small way.

02:15:15.046 --> 02:15:17.042
SAM: I'm going try to chip one off or pull one off.

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:18.847
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Or just get something loose.

02:15:18.847 --> 02:15:19.904
MATT: Make a dexterity check for me.

02:15:19.904 --> 02:15:21.719
SAM: Oh boy.

02:15:21.719 --> 02:15:23.939
SAM: Three. (laughs)

02:15:23.939 --> 02:15:25.479
MATT: It is a skill che-- or an ability check,

02:15:25.479 --> 02:15:27.558
so you can't roll lower than a 10.

02:15:27.558 --> 02:15:28.391
SAM: What do I do?

02:15:28.391 --> 02:15:30.159
Athletics, acrobatics, or just straight--

02:15:30.159 --> 02:15:31.739
SAM: Just straight dexterity modifier.

02:15:31.739 --> 02:15:32.719
SAM: Oh, plus five.

02:15:32.719 --> 02:15:34.145
So 10 plus five?

02:15:34.145 --> 02:15:35.599
MATT: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Okay, 15.

02:15:35.599 --> 02:15:37.239
MATT: 15, without issue.

02:15:37.239 --> 02:15:38.627
SAM: Okay, and I'll

02:15:38.627 --> 02:15:39.559
pop it over the side.
MATT: You pull it out.

02:15:39.559 --> 02:15:42.389
Okay. You get the sense that some of these might be,

02:15:42.389 --> 02:15:43.889
well, it looks small.

02:15:43.889 --> 02:15:47.729
Who knows what's holding all of this jumble of barely

02:15:47.729 --> 02:15:49.729
balanced stone together.
SAM: Mm.

02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:51.976
MATT: And as you pluck it, it's a brief moment as you pull it

02:15:51.976 --> 02:15:56.043
and you go, "Oh, that could have been bad."

02:15:56.043 --> 02:15:57.269
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.
MATT: But you're good.

02:15:57.269 --> 02:15:59.169
And you chuck it off the side?
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:16:02.389 --> 02:16:03.649
MATT: You don't hear anything.

02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:04.482
ASHLEY: Oh.
SAM: Ever?

02:16:05.569 --> 02:16:06.689
MATT: Well, make a perception check.

02:16:06.689 --> 02:16:08.479
SAM: Oh, boy.
TRAVIS: Last time we--

02:16:08.479 --> 02:16:10.579
SAM: Perception, six.
LAURA: Oof.

02:16:10.579 --> 02:16:11.859
MATT: You don't hear anything.

02:16:11.859 --> 02:16:12.796
SAM: Oh my god, it's endless!

02:16:12.796 --> 02:16:14.372
TRAVIS: It's a bunch of black symbiotes at the bottom.

02:16:14.372 --> 02:16:15.509
LAURA: Yup. Yup.

02:16:15.509 --> 02:16:18.599
We've been here. (laughs)

02:16:18.599 --> 02:16:19.432
SAM: Okay.

02:16:20.309 --> 02:16:22.062
I will radio back.

02:16:23.339 --> 02:16:25.264
Breaker one, breaker one-nine.

02:16:25.264 --> 02:16:27.829
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:16:27.829 --> 02:16:31.199
SAM: I'll tell Caleb, you know, you can crawl on through,

02:16:31.199 --> 02:16:33.412
there's no traps, but it ends.

02:16:34.599 --> 02:16:36.109
If you want to come or should I come back?

02:16:36.109 --> 02:16:37.199
You can reply to this message.

02:16:37.199 --> 02:16:39.359
LIAM: Yeah, okay, there's nothing dangerous

02:16:39.359 --> 02:16:41.569
that is going to bite me in there?

02:16:41.569 --> 02:16:42.819
SAM: Nothing dangerous.

02:16:42.819 --> 02:16:43.652
TRAVIS: Besides you.

02:16:43.652 --> 02:16:46.559
LIAM: So I'm going to start to crawl up slowly with

02:16:47.729 --> 02:16:51.419
two globules lighting my way 'til I reach her.

02:16:51.419 --> 02:16:52.252
MATT: Very well.

02:16:52.252 --> 02:16:54.167
So then I--
SAM: Just you?

02:16:54.167 --> 02:16:55.509
LIAM: No, I tell everyone what I'm doing.

02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:59.689
LAURA: Is there a standing platform at the end of the

02:17:00.954 --> 02:17:01.787
little crawl space?
TRAVIS: That's a good question.

02:17:01.787 --> 02:17:05.362
Is it a Die Hard elevator shaft and the AC joint

02:17:05.362 --> 02:17:08.329
and then you're just down or can you kind of stand up?

02:17:08.329 --> 02:17:09.162
ASHLEY: Good reference.

02:17:09.162 --> 02:17:13.819
MATT: No, it's a shaft and then it just drops into darkness.

02:17:13.819 --> 02:17:14.699
TRAVIS: And you're in the crawl space?

02:17:14.699 --> 02:17:16.709
MATT: And it looks like it opens a little bit,

02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:20.539
but whatever impact caused this to collapse beneath

02:17:20.539 --> 02:17:22.357
is what's left there.
TRAVIS: Boy, boy, boy.

02:17:22.357 --> 02:17:25.382
MATT: So it's very tight and it's very precarious.

02:17:26.219 --> 02:17:27.052
LIAM: Okay, so--

02:17:27.052 --> 02:17:28.949
MATT: But there are signs of previous climbing.

02:17:28.949 --> 02:17:30.409
SAM: Well, then maybe I should go back

02:17:30.409 --> 02:17:32.769
and we can talk about this in a bigger space?

02:17:32.769 --> 02:17:34.709
I don't know, because otherwise it's going to be like--

02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:36.539
TRAVIS: He can fly, a flyer would be good.

02:17:36.539 --> 02:17:39.359
LIAM: Well, I've just reached up and looked over the side

02:17:39.359 --> 02:17:42.009
and actually I'm going to make all four globules appear

02:17:42.009 --> 02:17:44.589
and keep one with us.

02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:46.709
I mean, we need to figure this out.

02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:48.517
SAM: Of course, but--
LIAM: This is the only way forward.

02:17:48.517 --> 02:17:50.409
SAM: But this will alert people to our presence.

02:17:50.409 --> 02:17:52.281
If there are people to be--

02:17:52.281 --> 02:17:53.396
LAURA: Look at those little globules.

02:17:53.396 --> 02:17:54.869
LIAM: Did you toss anything down?

02:17:54.869 --> 02:17:56.879
SAM: I tossed something down, I didn't hear anything.

02:17:56.879 --> 02:17:58.594
LAURA: Did you think that tentacles or something?

02:17:58.594 --> 02:18:00.356
MARISHA: What the fuck is happening?

02:18:00.356 --> 02:18:01.397
What now?

02:18:01.397 --> 02:18:02.559
MATT: Those are his globules.
SAM: I mean, yeah. Go ahead.

02:18:02.559 --> 02:18:05.248
Globule it down, there's nobody down there.

02:18:05.248 --> 02:18:06.838
LIAM: I'm going to throw a little pebble from my pouch.

02:18:06.838 --> 02:18:09.066
LAURA: Keep saying globules.
LIAM: Globule.

02:18:09.066 --> 02:18:09.899
MATT: Okay.

02:18:09.899 --> 02:18:10.799
LIAM: Globule.
TRAVIS: Globule.

02:18:10.799 --> 02:18:11.894
SAM: You're going to throw another pebble?

02:18:11.894 --> 02:18:14.317
I did this, I did the pebble trick.
LIAM: I'm going to listen.

02:18:14.317 --> 02:18:15.229
Do I hear anything?

02:18:15.229 --> 02:18:16.670
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:18:16.670 --> 02:18:18.729
SAM: I did it already, you're just--

02:18:18.729 --> 02:18:21.039
LIAM: Oh, so bad.
TRAVIS: (gulps)

02:18:21.039 --> 02:18:21.892
So bad.

02:18:23.262 --> 02:18:24.359
16.

02:18:24.359 --> 02:18:25.839
MATT: You don't hear anything.

02:18:25.839 --> 02:18:27.839
LIAM: Well, there's no point doing globules.

02:18:27.839 --> 02:18:29.049
But I'm going to do it anyway.

02:18:29.049 --> 02:18:31.449
I'm going to send three of them sort of spiraling around

02:18:31.449 --> 02:18:33.665
each other in a circle, a hundred feet down.

02:18:33.665 --> 02:18:35.429
MATT: Hundred feet down? Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:39.179
MATT: So, what's the radius in
the light there for each glob?

02:18:39.179 --> 02:18:40.379
LIAM: It is...

02:18:41.739 --> 02:18:43.642
Does it say anywhere?
TRAVIS: 40 feet?

02:18:43.642 --> 02:18:45.332
LIAM: A 10-foot radius, each one.

02:18:45.332 --> 02:18:46.165
MATT: 10 foot radius, got it.

02:18:46.165 --> 02:18:48.289
LIAM: They will go 40 feet away from each other

02:18:48.289 --> 02:18:49.439
in a wide circle.

02:18:49.439 --> 02:18:50.272
MATT: Okay.

02:18:50.272 --> 02:18:54.059
The pit itself is about 20 to 25 feet across,

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:56.659
so they can cover the space without issue.

02:18:56.659 --> 02:18:57.669
So as the one that stays with you,

02:18:57.669 --> 02:19:00.789
giving the soft glow to the immediate space,

02:19:00.789 --> 02:19:02.849
the other three slowly spiral,

02:19:02.849 --> 02:19:05.109
this trilogy of lights,

02:19:05.109 --> 02:19:07.779
just slowly descending in a corkscrew below.

02:19:07.779 --> 02:19:09.789
You watch as they continue downward.

02:19:09.789 --> 02:19:13.169
There are sections of stone that got caught on the way down.

02:19:13.169 --> 02:19:16.709
There was a collapse that caused this tunnel to fall in

02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:18.419
and you can see bits of debris.

02:19:18.419 --> 02:19:21.129
And you swear you see the edge of what looks like a door

02:19:21.129 --> 02:19:25.329
that is partially jammed out of the stone and ice.

02:19:25.329 --> 02:19:26.689
You can see some scroll work on it,

02:19:26.689 --> 02:19:28.601
but most of it's still buried in the rock and ice

02:19:28.601 --> 02:19:30.719
in the side of the wall, partway down.

02:19:30.719 --> 02:19:32.939
LIAM: Is there any sort of outcrop or ledge

02:19:32.939 --> 02:19:34.959
where that door is that we could stand on?

02:19:34.959 --> 02:19:36.749
MATT: No, it's not a door that's sitting on something,

02:19:36.749 --> 02:19:38.669
it's a door that is partially pushed out.

02:19:38.669 --> 02:19:39.859
It's out of place.

02:19:39.859 --> 02:19:41.039
It shouldn't be there.

02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:44.995
It's 'Philadelphia Experiment', out of the wall, of a door.

02:19:47.039 --> 02:19:51.069
Looking down through this, it is not a smooth descent.

02:19:51.069 --> 02:19:53.689
It is an open space, but it tends to slightly

02:19:53.689 --> 02:19:55.949
worm its way as they continue downward.

02:19:55.949 --> 02:19:59.609
And there are bits of jagged rock that jut outward.

02:19:59.609 --> 02:20:02.359
Falling down here, you can see, would be

02:20:02.359 --> 02:20:03.929
probably a very painful experience

02:20:03.929 --> 02:20:07.332
beyond just whatever might be waiting for you at the bottom.

02:20:08.479 --> 02:20:13.399
But you can see as they descend, the rope itself continues.

02:20:13.399 --> 02:20:15.789
It doesn't break, or at least, it isn't severed.

02:20:15.789 --> 02:20:17.923
There is a rope that goes all the way--

02:20:17.923 --> 02:20:19.629
LIAM: Door-- goes past the door into the darkness?

02:20:19.629 --> 02:20:21.419
MATT: Past-- yeah, past the door, into darkness.

02:20:21.419 --> 02:20:23.144
TRAVIS: (shudders)

02:20:23.144 --> 02:20:27.039
MATT: Eventually, you see the walls of the pit

02:20:27.039 --> 02:20:28.719
begin to open up a bit.

02:20:28.719 --> 02:20:31.305
To the point where almost like you're--

02:20:31.305 --> 02:20:35.919
the fall of this shaft opens up into something below

02:20:35.919 --> 02:20:40.289
but the lights reach the end of their distance from you

02:20:40.289 --> 02:20:43.189
and all you see is darkness.

02:20:46.039 --> 02:20:50.349
Darkness and a singular frost coated rope,

02:20:50.349 --> 02:20:52.893
dangling and vanishing into the abyss below.

02:20:52.893 --> 02:20:55.369
TRAVIS: That's fucking terrible. (laughs)

02:20:55.369 --> 02:20:57.249
SAM: Just in case, I'm going to cast Mage Hand

02:20:57.249 --> 02:21:00.549
and on the opposite wall to us just to touch it,

02:21:00.549 --> 02:21:01.939
to see if it's solid.

02:21:01.939 --> 02:21:03.279
Not an illusion or something.

02:21:03.279 --> 02:21:04.112
MATT: Okay.

02:21:05.179 --> 02:21:08.039
As Mage Hand pushes, moves across,

02:21:08.039 --> 02:21:11.003
you can see bits of frost fall

02:21:11.003 --> 02:21:12.289
and a bit of small pebble.

02:21:12.289 --> 02:21:14.499
SAM: Okay, it's not just a fake out.

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:15.399
TRAVIS: "How you doin'."

02:21:15.399 --> 02:21:17.979
LIAM: And remind us, how tight is the space where Veth and I

02:21:17.979 --> 02:21:19.229
are now at the--

02:21:19.229 --> 02:21:21.609
MATT: It's about two feet across, to one and a half foot.

02:21:21.609 --> 02:21:23.882
So you guys are-- about two feet across.

02:21:23.882 --> 02:21:25.270
LAURA: You're on each other.
LIAM: We're like this, yeah.

02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:27.059
MATT: So you guys are like right up next to each other.

02:21:27.059 --> 02:21:31.279
We're talking-- this is-- it's a little bit larger than

02:21:31.279 --> 02:21:34.719
Bishop in 'Aliens' going through that tight tunnel

02:21:34.719 --> 02:21:35.809
to get to the satellite dish.

02:21:35.809 --> 02:21:37.559
So there's just enough space for the two of you.

02:21:37.559 --> 02:21:40.009
You could not fit Veth with probably Yasha or Fjord.

02:21:40.009 --> 02:21:42.559
LIAM: I pull out the copper wire
and I send a message to Veth

02:21:42.559 --> 02:21:46.849
going: I think we should get the other people up here.

02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:48.661
You can reply to this message.

02:21:48.661 --> 02:21:50.279
(laughter)

02:21:50.279 --> 02:21:53.687
SAM: And then Mage Hand will come back and just go--

02:21:54.749 --> 02:21:57.309
LIAM: Okay, we are coming back.

02:21:57.309 --> 02:22:00.282
We have something to report.

02:22:01.179 --> 02:22:02.869
We are on the verge of being stuck, but--

02:22:02.869 --> 02:22:04.562
SAM: We are stuck.
LIAM: You go first.

02:22:04.562 --> 02:22:07.038
SAM: Send Vaseline.
LIAM: You can reply to this message.

02:22:07.038 --> 02:22:07.871
Veth, go.

02:22:07.871 --> 02:22:08.704
SAM: Okay.

02:22:10.919 --> 02:22:12.089
MATT: Okay.

02:22:12.089 --> 02:22:13.982
Eventually, Veth, you scoot your way back

02:22:13.982 --> 02:22:14.959
to the rest of the group and you see,

02:22:14.959 --> 02:22:16.528
as she emerges from--
MARISHA: ♪ Scootin' my way back ♪

02:22:16.528 --> 02:22:18.329
(laughter)

02:22:18.329 --> 02:22:19.270
MATT: Emerges from the crawl space.

02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:22.409
SAM: That was high level, high level.

02:22:22.409 --> 02:22:24.059
ASHLEY: Who was the next in the lineup?

02:22:25.093 --> 02:22:26.418
MATT: Next would have been Fjord.

02:22:26.418 --> 02:22:27.484
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:22:29.979 --> 02:22:31.199
SAM: Okay, so what do we do?

02:22:31.199 --> 02:22:33.259
I guess we were-- this is it, right?

02:22:33.259 --> 02:22:34.339
There's no other tunnels or anything?

02:22:34.339 --> 02:22:36.289
LIAM: We recount all that, right.
SAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:22:36.289 --> 02:22:40.399
LIAM: So there's a doorway some of the way down.

02:22:40.399 --> 02:22:43.129
SAM: It's a door, it's not a door<i>way</i>.

02:22:43.129 --> 02:22:44.368
It's a door sticking--

02:22:44.368 --> 02:22:46.374
TRAVIS: Like an open or is there a-- (clicking)

02:22:46.374 --> 02:22:48.469
SAM: No, I think it's just a piece of--

02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:49.752
MATT: To clarify.
LIAM: Yes, please.

02:22:49.752 --> 02:22:53.439
MATT: What you saw was a solid, rocky,

02:22:53.439 --> 02:22:55.909
dangerous descent, this pit.

02:22:55.909 --> 02:22:58.719
And then, in one of the pit walls there was a door

02:22:58.719 --> 02:23:00.862
just partially jutting out of it.

02:23:01.699 --> 02:23:03.449
It wasn't a door that opens inward.

02:23:03.449 --> 02:23:06.389
It's like someone shoved a--
LIAM: Jammed a door in.

02:23:06.389 --> 02:23:07.222
MATT: Yeah.

02:23:07.222 --> 02:23:10.272
Unattached to any doorframe, doorway,
or opening to anything.

02:23:10.272 --> 02:23:12.419
TRAVIS: It's just a door.
MATT: It's just a door

02:23:12.419 --> 02:23:14.085
partially sticking out of the wall.

02:23:14.085 --> 02:23:15.089
LIAM: Like a shelf.
MATT: Yeah.

02:23:15.089 --> 02:23:16.475
LIAM: For no reason.
MATT: Yeah.

02:23:16.475 --> 02:23:17.599
MARISHA: That door knows what it did.

02:23:17.599 --> 02:23:19.809
LAURA: Yeah. That door is a warning to us.

02:23:19.809 --> 02:23:21.432
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Door's got some stories.

02:23:21.432 --> 02:23:23.059
(laughter)

02:23:23.059 --> 02:23:24.069
TRAVIS: All right.
MARISHA: Doors be warned.

02:23:24.069 --> 02:23:25.519
TRAVIS: Nicodranas?
SAM: Campaign one.

02:23:25.519 --> 02:23:26.752
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:23:26.752 --> 02:23:27.971
LAURA: (laughs) Nicodranas, huh?

02:23:27.971 --> 02:23:30.135
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
LIAM: Vox Machina got fucking fed up.

02:23:30.135 --> 02:23:31.399
LAURA: Word of Recall? Let's go.

02:23:31.399 --> 02:23:35.569
TRAVIS: And it opens up at the
bottom approximately how deep?

02:23:35.569 --> 02:23:36.679
LIAM: Uh...

02:23:36.679 --> 02:23:39.332
I mean, where it widens out from the look of the globule?

02:23:39.332 --> 02:23:42.283
MATT: It widens out at about the 85 foot depth.

02:23:42.283 --> 02:23:43.229
LIAM: Woo!

02:23:43.229 --> 02:23:44.868
MATT: And then 15 feet past,

02:23:44.868 --> 02:23:46.759
the light ends before you get there.

02:23:46.759 --> 02:23:50.349
LIAM: I run out of light at 120 feet with that spell.

02:23:50.349 --> 02:23:51.182
LIAM: Can't go further than that.
TALIESIN: This is bringing back

02:23:51.182 --> 02:23:52.709
some dreams right now.

02:23:52.709 --> 02:23:54.421
TRAVIS: It feels vaguely reminiscent of when,

02:23:54.421 --> 02:23:58.049
the last time we were-- as we descended down into the cavern

02:23:58.049 --> 02:23:59.719
that had the trees that you didn't like.

02:23:59.719 --> 02:24:00.651
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:24:00.651 --> 02:24:01.699
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:24:01.699 --> 02:24:03.969
MARISHA: Well--
SAM: We can descend again.

02:24:03.969 --> 02:24:04.802
MARISHA: Well, hang on.

02:24:04.802 --> 02:24:08.109
Are we going to say anything to these rangers out here?

02:24:08.109 --> 02:24:10.759
We need to give them direction to let them know

02:24:10.759 --> 02:24:13.309
that they need to let the Tomb Takers go by

02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:15.259
and not interfere with them.

02:24:15.259 --> 02:24:16.539
LAURA: We kind of already did.

02:24:16.539 --> 02:24:19.395
MARISHA: But then are they going to blow the door?

02:24:19.395 --> 02:24:20.365
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: Nobody asked.

02:24:20.365 --> 02:24:22.704
LAURA: No, they're going to use the walkie-talkies

02:24:22.704 --> 02:24:25.725
that Essek gave to let us know if somebody is coming.

02:24:25.725 --> 02:24:26.558
MARISHA: Right.

02:24:26.558 --> 02:24:28.369
And then are they going to blow the door after they go in?

02:24:28.369 --> 02:24:29.429
TRAVIS: The thing you're hinting at is,

02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:30.979
we were going to pick an ambush point

02:24:30.979 --> 02:24:33.399
and this is a decent sized one.

02:24:33.399 --> 02:24:36.449
This is a really, really acute pinch point.

02:24:36.449 --> 02:24:39.946
But if they're going to keep going,

02:24:39.946 --> 02:24:42.009
it might be nicer to have them,

02:24:42.009 --> 02:24:43.929
I don't know, get hit by an intuit charge

02:24:43.929 --> 02:24:45.835
as they're climbing down a tunnel that goes into

02:24:45.835 --> 02:24:47.259
darkness.
MARISHA: Nothing.

02:24:47.259 --> 02:24:49.119
Or if they can go over--
LIAM: Did we discuss though,

02:24:49.119 --> 02:24:50.209
I'm talking out of character here,

02:24:50.209 --> 02:24:53.984
just our memories, that the intuits are psychic damage?

02:24:53.984 --> 02:24:55.393
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: And the Tomb Takers are--

02:24:55.393 --> 02:24:57.384
that's not a big deal for them.
TRAVIS: You're stunned for a minute?

02:24:57.384 --> 02:24:59.729
MARISHA: Well, for Lucien.
TALIESIN: It won't.

02:24:59.729 --> 02:25:02.238
LIAM: Just Lucien?
MARISHA: Well, we don't know.

02:25:02.238 --> 02:25:05.339
I can confirm Lucien, but even if we take out

02:25:05.339 --> 02:25:07.510
the rest of the Tomb Takers--

02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:09.660
SAM: I could also put a fluffernutter

02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:11.509
in this little crawl space tunnel.

02:25:11.509 --> 02:25:12.479
TRAVIS: You could.

02:25:12.479 --> 02:25:14.792
SAM: And somehow trigger it remotely?

02:25:14.792 --> 02:25:17.624
TRAVIS: We would also need another way out.

02:25:17.624 --> 02:25:22.624
LAURA: I could also put the symbol, the spell that I have.

02:25:22.779 --> 02:25:24.445
TALIESIN: Not today.
SAM: What's the spell?

02:25:24.445 --> 02:25:26.449
LAURA: The spell is I can leave a glyph somewhere

02:25:26.449 --> 02:25:28.389
where they won't see it and it'll trigger

02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:30.279
when they pass by it or when they touch it.

02:25:30.279 --> 02:25:31.599
SAM: And does it blow up?

02:25:31.599 --> 02:25:34.069
LAURA: It can do a lot of damage to them.

02:25:34.069 --> 02:25:35.649
It can make them very scared.

02:25:35.649 --> 02:25:36.689
It can stun them.

02:25:36.689 --> 02:25:38.149
It can do all sorts of things.

02:25:38.149 --> 02:25:39.656
Whatever we want it to do.

02:25:39.656 --> 02:25:40.989
But it might be smarter

02:25:40.989 --> 02:25:43.959
to do that close to wherever we plan to attack them.

02:25:43.959 --> 02:25:46.129
Because if it takes them out for a minute--

02:25:46.129 --> 02:25:46.962
TALIESIN: Right.

02:25:46.962 --> 02:25:48.349
LAURA: We need to take advantage of that minute.

02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:51.059
LIAM: And if you can stun, won't we want to take advantage

02:25:51.059 --> 02:25:53.329
of that one minute where they can't move, so.

02:25:53.329 --> 02:25:54.162
LAURA: Exactly.

02:25:54.162 --> 02:25:56.099
TRAVIS: I sure would love to set an intuit charge

02:25:56.099 --> 02:25:57.189
at the top of the tunnel.

02:25:57.189 --> 02:25:59.249
It does psychic damage and stuns them,

02:25:59.249 --> 02:26:02.929
four of them fall and fall past your glyph on the way down.

02:26:02.929 --> 02:26:03.979
MARISHA: Man, that would be epic.

02:26:03.979 --> 02:26:05.661
TRAVIS: That would be fucking awesome.

02:26:05.661 --> 02:26:07.359
TALIESIN: Unless they're all immune to psychic.

02:26:07.359 --> 02:26:09.289
TRAVIS: But, we also don't know what's at the bottom

02:26:09.289 --> 02:26:10.129
of this tunnel.

02:26:10.129 --> 02:26:13.222
So someone that can fly should go down and at least see

02:26:13.222 --> 02:26:15.000
what the hell that darkness actually is.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.189
MARISHA: And just, not to keep pushing this,

02:26:16.189 --> 02:26:18.748
but we-- hang on, speaking as Marisha for a second,

02:26:18.748 --> 02:26:20.309
we were talking about--
LIAM: Who's that?

02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:24.449
MARISHA: -- having-- don't know her, having the

02:26:24.449 --> 02:26:28.179
rangers potentially blow the tunnel in case Lucien and co

02:26:28.179 --> 02:26:31.309
got in 20 feet and went, "Something smells fishy.

02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:32.959
Let's go back the other way."
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:26:32.959 --> 02:26:35.499
MARISHA: So we were talking about
having them collapse the tunnel,

02:26:35.499 --> 02:26:38.869
so they can't decide, "This feels compromised.

02:26:38.869 --> 02:26:40.352
"We're going to backtrack."

02:26:41.479 --> 02:26:42.979
MARISHA: Just throwing that out there, I don't know.

02:26:42.979 --> 02:26:45.169
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I believe they know about that.

02:26:45.169 --> 02:26:46.801
I think we had a discussion.
LAURA: I mean, we can always

02:26:46.801 --> 02:26:47.659
tell them.
MATT: I don't know if you

02:26:47.659 --> 02:26:49.589
directly relayed that.
TALIESIN: No.

02:26:49.589 --> 02:26:52.073
TRAVIS: That would have to be one of your things, right?

02:26:52.073 --> 02:26:53.186
That would have to be a fluffernutter,

02:26:53.186 --> 02:26:54.339
unless the rangers have--
SAM: Sure, yeah.

02:26:54.339 --> 02:26:55.679
We can leave one with them.

02:26:55.679 --> 02:26:58.009
But just throwing this out there,

02:26:58.009 --> 02:27:01.799
we have the ability to extricate ourselves

02:27:01.799 --> 02:27:06.159
from a situation without passing through a rock wall.

02:27:06.159 --> 02:27:08.086
Maybe they can?
TALIESIN: They can, too.

02:27:08.086 --> 02:27:12.502
ASHLEY: And do we know for sure
they're not down there already?

02:27:12.502 --> 02:27:13.501
LIAM: We don't know for sure.

02:27:13.501 --> 02:27:14.452
SAM: Well yeah, we could scry--

02:27:14.452 --> 02:27:17.020
LIAM: We saw snow, you saw snow when you peeped at them.

02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:18.937
LAURA: I didn't see shit.
LIAM: I thought you saw snow.

02:27:18.937 --> 02:27:20.889
LAURA: I saw a flash of red.

02:27:20.889 --> 02:27:22.992
Maybe I saw snow.
LIAM: There was a moment before, though.

02:27:22.992 --> 02:27:24.732
SAM: No, he said it was a dark cloud.

02:27:24.732 --> 02:27:26.180
TRAVIS: The other thing is--
LAURA: It was foggy

02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:27.791
and then a flash of red and then I was like,

02:27:27.791 --> 02:27:29.066
ugh, no, that didn't work.

02:27:29.066 --> 02:27:31.389
TRAVIS: The other thing is, would they see your glyph

02:27:31.389 --> 02:27:33.549
if they saw the dome and if they can see your door?

02:27:33.549 --> 02:27:37.139
LAURA: The goal would be to put the glyph on the underside.

02:27:37.139 --> 02:27:38.399
Like, if we're passing through

02:27:38.399 --> 02:27:39.915
a doorway or something, I would put it on

02:27:39.915 --> 02:27:41.032
the opposite side of the door.

02:27:41.032 --> 02:27:43.269
So they wouldn't see it.
LIAM: Blocked by stone.

02:27:43.269 --> 02:27:44.409
LAURA: Exactly.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:27:44.409 --> 02:27:45.349
MARISHA: Bucket on the door ledge.

02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:49.166
LIAM: And we have total, Matt,

02:27:49.166 --> 02:27:50.807
four of those intuit charges.

02:27:50.807 --> 02:27:53.949
'Cause I had one for a while and then in the bag we ganged

02:27:53.949 --> 02:27:57.019
from the Tomb Takers that had three or two?

02:27:57.019 --> 02:27:58.309
MATT: I have to look at my notes again.

02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:59.899
LIAM: Criss cross.

02:28:01.232 --> 02:28:02.065
MARISHA: Okay.

02:28:02.065 --> 02:28:03.450
MATT: Yeah, they seem to be collecting them as well.

02:28:03.450 --> 02:28:05.116
TRAVIS: That would be--
ASHLEY: They had some of them--

02:28:05.116 --> 02:28:06.546
LIAM: Set 'em all off.

02:28:06.546 --> 02:28:09.069
There's a chance I won't be able to set them all.

02:28:09.069 --> 02:28:12.282
It's a high Arcana--
TRAVIS: Just to set it.

02:28:12.282 --> 02:28:13.999
LIAM: --just to check to set it.

02:28:13.999 --> 02:28:15.179
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:28:15.179 --> 02:28:16.809
LIAM: So we set as many as we can.

02:28:16.809 --> 02:28:19.779
SAM: Well, before we decide where we're ambushing them.

02:28:19.779 --> 02:28:20.612
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:28:20.612 --> 02:28:21.969
SAM: It feels like we need to explore a bit more.

02:28:21.969 --> 02:28:24.137
TALIESIN: Yes, we need to know the terrain.

02:28:24.137 --> 02:28:27.522
TRAVIS: Somebody that can walk on walls or can fly, or--?

02:28:28.889 --> 02:28:30.308
SAM: I can walk on walls if you want me to?

02:28:30.308 --> 02:28:32.000
TRAVIS: For a good amount of time--
TALIESIN: I'd prefer a flyer,

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.025
just so they don't have to touch--

02:28:33.025 --> 02:28:35.406
LIAM: I can fly, but I'm also--

02:28:35.406 --> 02:28:37.668
LAURA: But Essek can do it effortlessly.

02:28:37.668 --> 02:28:39.559
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

02:28:39.559 --> 02:28:41.979
LAURA: Right, Essek?
LIAM: He can float, but fly--

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:44.349
LAURA: Yeah, he just floated down an entire cliff side.

02:28:44.349 --> 02:28:46.999
SAM: I can Spider Climb for an hour.

02:28:46.999 --> 02:28:48.006
LIAM: There you go.
LAURA: Oh, wow.

02:28:48.006 --> 02:28:49.698
LIAM: That's what we're talking about.
LAURA: That's great.

02:28:49.698 --> 02:28:51.221
TRAVIS: You won't slip or fall or anything?

02:28:51.221 --> 02:28:53.555
SAM: No, but I could go with Essek,

02:28:53.555 --> 02:28:55.919
or with someone else?
MATT: "I can glide down,

02:28:55.919 --> 02:28:59.749
"but I do not have the ability to fly prepared for the day."

02:28:59.749 --> 02:29:01.603
TRAVIS: Oh, like you couldn't come back up?

02:29:01.603 --> 02:29:03.102
MATT: "Right."
LAURA: I understand.

02:29:03.102 --> 02:29:04.139
Okay, then Veth.

02:29:06.119 --> 02:29:07.209
LIAM: I don't want you to go alone.

02:29:07.209 --> 02:29:08.889
ASHLEY: I could go.
SAM: (whimpering)

02:29:08.889 --> 02:29:09.722
ASHLEY: I could go.

02:29:09.722 --> 02:29:10.989
SAM: Can you fly?

02:29:10.989 --> 02:29:12.114
ASHLEY: Well.

02:29:12.114 --> 02:29:13.060
SAM: I mean, for a while.

02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:14.349
ASHLEY: Yeah, for a minute.
LIAM: I tell you what.

02:29:14.349 --> 02:29:15.858
TRAVIS: I can fly for 10 minutes.

02:29:15.858 --> 02:29:17.399
ASHLEY: Oh, well, that's probably better.

02:29:17.399 --> 02:29:19.790
LIAM: I can Spider Climb, too,

02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:21.256
if I'm a spider and you can ride.
LAURA: I know.

02:29:21.256 --> 02:29:22.122
I was thinking the same thing.

02:29:22.122 --> 02:29:24.359
We could turn into ice spiders.

02:29:24.359 --> 02:29:25.742
SAM: Don't we want to save your spells?

02:29:25.742 --> 02:29:27.096
But yes, that's a great idea.

02:29:27.096 --> 02:29:29.078
LIAM:I don't need to burn a slot to do it.

02:29:29.078 --> 02:29:29.911
SAM: Oh!

02:29:29.911 --> 02:29:31.119
LIAM: Once a day.

02:29:31.119 --> 02:29:34.609
'Cause I'm a transmutation genius.

02:29:34.609 --> 02:29:35.550
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:29:37.496 --> 02:29:38.979
TALIESIN: Would you be able to carry us down

02:29:38.979 --> 02:29:40.070
also, as an ice spider?

02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:41.645
LIAM: I mean, I could probably spend

02:29:41.645 --> 02:29:43.169
half of my time as a spider

02:29:43.169 --> 02:29:44.002
to do that.

02:29:44.002 --> 02:29:45.787
LAURA: You carried me and Fjord before, so.

02:29:45.787 --> 02:29:47.239
If we had multiple--
SAM: Oh, I mean we could

02:29:47.239 --> 02:29:49.953
just Feather Fall us down.

02:29:49.953 --> 02:29:52.449
TRAVIS: But we don't want to just go down the--

02:29:52.449 --> 02:29:54.889
LIAM: The creepy crawly is the way to go.

02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:58.189
So I can be a large spider for an hour.

02:29:58.189 --> 02:30:01.915
We spend the first half of that or less, hopefully,

02:30:01.915 --> 02:30:04.691
taking a look and then if it's okay, then--

02:30:04.691 --> 02:30:06.960
(skittering)

02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:08.981
TRAVIS: Sure.
LIAM: That's me playing a piano.

02:30:08.981 --> 02:30:10.384
TALIESIN: If it's bad, just--

02:30:10.384 --> 02:30:11.642
SAM: You want to come?
TALIESIN: We'll probably know,

02:30:11.642 --> 02:30:13.559
but just make some noise if it's bad.

02:30:13.559 --> 02:30:14.529
MARISHA: No.

02:30:14.529 --> 02:30:16.549
SAM: Don't you have a climb with your monk shit?

02:30:16.549 --> 02:30:17.382
MARISHA: I can--

02:30:19.639 --> 02:30:21.209
I can slow fall.

02:30:21.209 --> 02:30:25.479
I can fall very gracefully and I can wall climb.

02:30:25.479 --> 02:30:26.312
SAM: That's all you need.

02:30:26.312 --> 02:30:27.145
LIAM: Right, sounds like science.

02:30:27.145 --> 02:30:30.779
MARISHA: I don't know if I can necessarily wall climb down.

02:30:30.779 --> 02:30:32.422
I think it's more of jutting up.

02:30:32.422 --> 02:30:33.859
SAM: But you could slow fall down.

02:30:33.859 --> 02:30:34.739
TALIESIN: The hop, the hop?

02:30:34.739 --> 02:30:35.572
LAURA: But you'd fall,

02:30:35.572 --> 02:30:37.349
and didn't you say there were--
SAM: And then wall climb up!

02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:39.616
LAURA: -- spikes?
MARISHA: Yeah, there's the spikies.

02:30:39.616 --> 02:30:40.762
TRAVIS: Maybe not the time.

02:30:40.762 --> 02:30:43.349
MARISHA: Yeah, I know I just said I will take advantage

02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:44.745
to jump off of any cliff--
SAM: You did.

02:30:44.745 --> 02:30:46.892
You just said that.
MARISHA: Like an hour ago.

02:30:46.892 --> 02:30:49.497
But this one...
TALIESIN: You got that one pass.

02:30:49.497 --> 02:30:51.212
SAM: You met a cliff that's too scary.

02:30:51.212 --> 02:30:52.374
MARISHA: It's the spikes.

02:30:52.374 --> 02:30:54.062
TRAVIS: All right, you two, go.
LAURA: Go, go, do something.

02:30:54.062 --> 02:30:55.549
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Okay. I could carry you

02:30:55.549 --> 02:30:57.639
down, as well as Yasha, too, if you like.

02:30:57.639 --> 02:30:58.612
MARISHA: As a spider?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:30:58.612 --> 02:31:00.282
MARISHA: You mean like ride a spider?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:31:00.282 --> 02:31:01.115
TRAVIS: We're just risking you,

02:31:01.115 --> 02:31:03.709
don't risk everybody.
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh)

02:31:03.709 --> 02:31:05.179
LIAM: Well, I'm bringing Yasha with me,

02:31:05.179 --> 02:31:08.966
because I'm weak as a spider and as a human.

02:31:08.966 --> 02:31:09.799
TALIESIN: Good call.
ASHLEY: I feel like, yeah,

02:31:09.799 --> 02:31:12.689
in case you get down there and you're not all alone.

02:31:12.689 --> 02:31:15.249
I mean, I absolutely can go with you.

02:31:15.249 --> 02:31:16.549
LIAM: Yes, please.

02:31:16.549 --> 02:31:18.019
ASHLEY: Of course.

02:31:18.019 --> 02:31:18.852
Yeah.

02:31:18.852 --> 02:31:19.685
SAM: Okay, bye.

02:31:20.649 --> 02:31:22.098
ASHLEY: And if I need to I can get a--
LIAM: (chittering, hissing)

02:31:22.098 --> 02:31:24.188
SAM: Ah!

02:31:24.188 --> 02:31:25.439
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: That's cute!

02:31:25.439 --> 02:31:27.744
ASHLEY: Ooh, look at you! You look so tasty, Caleb.

02:31:27.744 --> 02:31:30.199
MATT: Caleb, could you roll a d20 for me, please?

02:31:30.199 --> 02:31:32.065
LIAM: Oh yeah, cool!

02:31:32.065 --> 02:31:34.523
LAURA: (gasps) Oh yeah.
LIAM: 12.

02:31:34.523 --> 02:31:35.437
MATT: 12?
LIAM: 12.

02:31:35.437 --> 02:31:36.799
MATT: Okay.

02:31:36.799 --> 02:31:39.362
You transform into a spider.

02:31:40.819 --> 02:31:41.652
LAURA: That's right.

02:31:42.551 --> 02:31:43.384
TRAVIS: What?

02:31:43.384 --> 02:31:45.059
LAURA: You have to roll one or a 20.
SAM: I'm going to cast Spider Climb

02:31:45.059 --> 02:31:47.009
on myself.

02:31:47.009 --> 02:31:49.859
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20 yourself, please.

02:31:49.859 --> 02:31:50.839
SAM: Oh.

02:31:50.839 --> 02:31:52.139
LAURA: Right?

02:31:52.139 --> 02:31:53.447
Magic.
SAM: Eight?

02:31:54.659 --> 02:31:55.492
MATT: Okay.

02:31:56.459 --> 02:31:58.469
TRAVIS: You die.
SAM: (whimpering)

02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:59.844
MATT: Your spell

02:31:59.844 --> 02:32:01.543
seems to imbue you with the spider climbing.

02:32:01.543 --> 02:32:03.149
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: "Seems"?!

02:32:03.149 --> 02:32:04.869
TALIESIN: Fucking fuck.

02:32:04.869 --> 02:32:07.767
SAM: This first step's gonna be a doozy.

02:32:07.767 --> 02:32:09.719
TRAVIS: Ah!

02:32:09.719 --> 02:32:10.552
SAM: All right,

02:32:10.552 --> 02:32:14.066
I'll start walking down the side of the wall.

02:32:14.066 --> 02:32:14.899
MATT: All righty.

02:32:14.899 --> 02:32:18.280
So spider and Spider Climb?
SAM: But in a jaunty way.

02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:21.219
LIAM: And I use two of my eight legs like a safety belt

02:32:21.219 --> 02:32:23.279
for Yasha.

02:32:23.279 --> 02:32:24.929
ASHLEY: I act like I take a bite.

02:32:24.929 --> 02:32:26.995
Om nom nom! Ooh, you're so tasty.

02:32:26.995 --> 02:32:29.210
LIAM: (chittering)

02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:30.243
ASHLEY: Give him tummy scratches.

02:32:30.243 --> 02:32:31.741
LAURA: I'm going to hang off, just looking over

02:32:31.741 --> 02:32:33.295
the side of the cliff to see.

02:32:34.339 --> 02:32:35.759
TRAVIS: You're the only one in the tunnel now.

02:32:35.759 --> 02:32:38.089
LAURA: I'll be in the tunnel, that way I can cast heal,

02:32:38.089 --> 02:32:42.096
if they're within, you know, 60 feet when they fall.

02:32:42.096 --> 02:32:42.929
TRAVIS: They won't be.

02:32:42.929 --> 02:32:43.762
LIAM: (clicking)

02:32:44.776 --> 02:32:45.789
TRAVIS: You'll just watch them die.

02:32:45.789 --> 02:32:47.326
LAURA: Yeah, well, I want to see.

02:32:47.326 --> 02:32:48.399
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh)

02:32:48.399 --> 02:32:49.232
MATT: Okay.

02:32:50.519 --> 02:32:55.039
As you begin to descend, a spider at a rapid speed of what?

02:32:55.039 --> 02:32:58.399
LIAM: 'Tis, speed is just 30 for climbing, forever.

02:32:58.399 --> 02:33:01.299
MATT: Okay. So the two of you climb at a respective rate

02:33:02.629 --> 02:33:05.666
making your way down until eventually it broadens out

02:33:05.666 --> 02:33:09.069
and you are now both standing upon the ceiling

02:33:09.069 --> 02:33:12.219
of a larger cavern amongst all manner of

02:33:12.219 --> 02:33:15.269
heavy ice icicles,

02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:18.159
massive, 12-foot long, pointed icicles.

02:33:18.159 --> 02:33:20.259
SAM: So it's widened out and--

02:33:20.259 --> 02:33:22.699
MATT: It widens out and then there's a forest of icicles

02:33:22.699 --> 02:33:23.819
that are all dripping off.

02:33:23.819 --> 02:33:25.019
SAM: We still don't see the ground?

02:33:25.019 --> 02:33:26.699
LIAM: So it opened into a chamber.

02:33:26.699 --> 02:33:27.807
MATT: Correct. You don't have any

02:33:27.807 --> 02:33:29.821
light sources currently below you.

02:33:29.821 --> 02:33:30.654
SAM: Correct.

02:33:30.654 --> 02:33:32.489
LIAM: So you are Mission Impossible-ing from the bottom

02:33:32.489 --> 02:33:34.929
of a large spider, like--

02:33:34.929 --> 02:33:36.699
SAM: Even though I've got Spider Climb,

02:33:36.699 --> 02:33:41.274
if I pick an icicle that drops,

02:33:41.274 --> 02:33:43.277
I'm still fucked.

02:33:43.277 --> 02:33:44.110
MATT: Yeah.

02:33:44.110 --> 02:33:46.519
SAM: It'll just stick me to the ice, but the ice could fall.

02:33:46.519 --> 02:33:47.352
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Cool.

02:33:47.352 --> 02:33:48.569
Cool, cool.

02:33:48.569 --> 02:33:50.139
TALIESIN: You have the goggles though, right?

02:33:50.139 --> 02:33:51.229
SAM: I have goggles, yeah.

02:33:51.229 --> 02:33:52.589
MATT: Yeah, for a range of 60 feet?

02:33:52.589 --> 02:33:53.422
LIAM: But it's so fun.

02:33:53.422 --> 02:33:56.479
MATT: Okay. You can just barely see

02:33:56.479 --> 02:33:59.466
the peripheral of your vision as you get down there

02:33:59.466 --> 02:34:01.516
and you have 60 foot darkvision as well?

02:34:02.709 --> 02:34:05.259
ASHLEY: I know I have darkvision, I'm pretty sure, yeah.

02:34:07.409 --> 02:34:10.349
LAURA: It's under your saving throws, passive perception.

02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:12.369
It's in that little box.
ASHLEY: Yes, darkvision, 60 feet.

02:34:12.369 --> 02:34:13.569
MATT: Correct. So both of you,

02:34:13.569 --> 02:34:15.519
as you begin to spread out,

02:34:15.519 --> 02:34:19.219
you can see small structures,

02:34:19.219 --> 02:34:23.159
or at least piles of something,

02:34:23.159 --> 02:34:24.671
right at the edge of that 60 foot,

02:34:24.671 --> 02:34:26.979
maybe about 50, 55 feet below you.

02:34:26.979 --> 02:34:29.729
So you get the essence that there is some sort of a floor,

02:34:29.729 --> 02:34:33.319
at least some something down there.

02:34:33.319 --> 02:34:35.939
It isn't an infinite pit and you're not that far away.

02:34:35.939 --> 02:34:38.722
So about 50 feet below you, there is a bottom.

02:34:39.819 --> 02:34:41.589
SAM: Okay. Okay.

02:34:41.589 --> 02:34:44.499
I guess we'll go across the ceiling

02:34:44.499 --> 02:34:47.799
to see if it ever meets or--

02:34:47.799 --> 02:34:50.666
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Or goes down?

02:34:50.666 --> 02:34:52.719
LIAM: (chittering)

02:34:52.719 --> 02:34:55.249
MATT: Curving over about--

02:34:55.249 --> 02:34:56.109
ASHLEY: Fun noise.

02:34:56.109 --> 02:34:56.942
LAURA: Scritch scritch.

02:34:56.942 --> 02:34:58.879
MATT: 70 or so feet from where the entrance is

02:34:58.879 --> 02:35:02.749
it begins to curve, and it's not a smooth curve.

02:35:02.749 --> 02:35:05.949
It's not a water-smoothed stone interior;

02:35:05.949 --> 02:35:07.499
it is broken and jagged in shelves

02:35:07.499 --> 02:35:11.019
and you have to climb your way carefully

02:35:11.019 --> 02:35:13.061
with Spider Climb below.

02:35:13.061 --> 02:35:16.085
Even with spider size,

02:35:18.849 --> 02:35:20.799
the proximity of all of these icicles,

02:35:20.799 --> 02:35:22.589
make it a little dangerous and precarious

02:35:22.589 --> 02:35:24.649
to find your way over there safely.

02:35:24.649 --> 02:35:27.469
So it does take a bit of maneuvering.

02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:30.544
I would like you both to make

02:35:31.469 --> 02:35:33.752
a athletics check.

02:35:33.752 --> 02:35:37.032
LIAM: (chittering)
SAM: Okay.

02:35:37.032 --> 02:35:38.132
LIAM: 13.
ASHLEY: Do I--?

02:35:38.132 --> 02:35:39.379
SAM: Cocked.

02:35:39.379 --> 02:35:40.342
ASHLEY: Do I help at all?

02:35:40.342 --> 02:35:42.639
MATT: You don't, you're just dangling.

02:35:42.639 --> 02:35:43.719
SAM: Athletics, 15.

02:35:43.719 --> 02:35:45.449
LIAM: You're a great adventurer.
MATT: 15, okay.

02:35:45.449 --> 02:35:48.509
Okay. Both of you just carefully make your way over

02:35:48.509 --> 02:35:49.531
to the edge--
ASHLEY: Oh, god.

02:35:49.531 --> 02:35:52.159
MATT: -- where a big portion of the ceiling drops

02:35:52.159 --> 02:35:55.509
and then catches at the edge of the interior

02:35:55.509 --> 02:35:57.719
of this stony chamber.

02:35:57.719 --> 02:35:58.949
So looking around the base of this pit,

02:35:58.949 --> 02:36:02.992
you can see what looks to be a small courtyard.

02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:05.559
Did you bring light with you?

02:36:05.559 --> 02:36:07.619
LIAM: I can see as a spider.

02:36:07.619 --> 02:36:09.474
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Darkvision

02:36:09.474 --> 02:36:11.289
and blind sense for 10 feet.

02:36:11.289 --> 02:36:15.849
MATT: So what you see are tumbled pillars of marble.

02:36:15.849 --> 02:36:18.479
You see a ruined rooftop across the way

02:36:18.479 --> 02:36:21.019
that is splayed open at a violent angle

02:36:21.019 --> 02:36:23.609
from what looks like a toppled tower.

02:36:23.609 --> 02:36:25.359
You can see a single stone bench

02:36:25.359 --> 02:36:29.662
rising defiantly amongst piles of broken stone and wood.

02:36:31.009 --> 02:36:34.459
It's shards of a society long lost,

02:36:34.459 --> 02:36:37.392
now a frozen graveyard.

02:36:40.669 --> 02:36:43.039
That's what you see ahead of you.

02:36:43.922 --> 02:36:45.679
SAM: Okay.

02:36:45.679 --> 02:36:47.771
ASHLEY: Caleb, can you understand me?

02:36:47.771 --> 02:36:49.709
LIAM: (chittering)

02:36:49.709 --> 02:36:51.158
ASHLEY: I don't know what that means.

02:36:51.158 --> 02:36:52.014
SAM: (laughs)

02:36:52.014 --> 02:36:55.729
LIAM: I'm seeing a hundred Yashas,

02:36:55.729 --> 02:36:57.970
broken in all the little eyes.

02:36:57.970 --> 02:37:00.419
LAURA: Ooh, cool.
MARISHA: Hot.

02:37:00.419 --> 02:37:04.539
SAM: Maybe tell him to shoot out some webbing

02:37:04.539 --> 02:37:06.219
if he understands you.

02:37:06.219 --> 02:37:07.366
Just crap some out.

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:11.670
ASHLEY: Yeah. Pull a little webbing
out if you understand me.

02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:14.509
LIAM: (spitting)

02:37:14.509 --> 02:37:15.342
ASHLEY: He understands me.

02:37:15.342 --> 02:37:16.279
SAM: It's super gross.

02:37:16.279 --> 02:37:17.280
ASHLEY: Yep.

02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:19.313
LIAM: (chittering)

02:37:19.313 --> 02:37:20.319
ASHLEY: What do we do?

02:37:20.319 --> 02:37:21.769
SAM: We should explore.

02:37:21.769 --> 02:37:23.169
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:37:23.169 --> 02:37:24.002
SAM: So we'll just walk--

02:37:24.002 --> 02:37:25.052
How long's it been?

02:37:25.988 --> 02:37:26.889
It's 10 minutes?

02:37:26.889 --> 02:37:28.624
MATT: Maybe five minutes.
SAM: Okay.

02:37:28.624 --> 02:37:29.849
MATT: Well, no, with the careful crawling

02:37:29.849 --> 02:37:31.799
across the ceiling, I'd say closer to 10, probably,

02:37:31.799 --> 02:37:33.629
just slowly bringing your way.

02:37:33.629 --> 02:37:35.882
SAM: So we'll just look around.

02:37:35.882 --> 02:37:38.079
MATT: I would like both of you with darkvision

02:37:38.079 --> 02:37:39.826
to make perception checks, please.

02:37:39.826 --> 02:37:41.339
All of you, with the spider thing as well.

02:37:41.339 --> 02:37:42.939
LIAM: Terrible roll.

02:37:42.939 --> 02:37:44.010
SAM: Natural one.

02:37:44.010 --> 02:37:45.768
LAURA: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: Natural 19.

02:37:45.768 --> 02:37:47.189
SAM: Okay, thank god.
MATT: And there's still the 10.

02:37:47.189 --> 02:37:50.538
ASHLEY: Plus five, 24.

02:37:50.538 --> 02:37:51.438
LIAM: Six.

02:37:51.438 --> 02:37:54.530
SAM: My eyes are on backwards, everything looks small.

02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:55.534
(laughter)

02:37:55.534 --> 02:37:57.619
Ah!

02:37:57.619 --> 02:38:00.209
MATT: Well, they're having a hard time adjusting.

02:38:00.209 --> 02:38:02.412
You grew up in darker environments.

02:38:03.789 --> 02:38:04.622
And in glancing around,

02:38:04.622 --> 02:38:07.729
you can see the broken space around you.

02:38:07.729 --> 02:38:11.359
There is, a little ways to your right

02:38:11.359 --> 02:38:14.957
and against this somewhat ragged wall,

02:38:14.957 --> 02:38:18.212
what looks to be a still partially standing tower.

02:38:19.709 --> 02:38:22.989
It looks like a pentagonal building

02:38:22.989 --> 02:38:26.829
of simpler architecture if heavily damaged

02:38:26.829 --> 02:38:29.359
that still stands at about two stories tall.

02:38:29.359 --> 02:38:32.699
But the second story is at a cracked angle.

02:38:32.699 --> 02:38:36.489
The rock shelf itself of this chamber, pushing into it,

02:38:36.489 --> 02:38:37.869
near the edge of toppling.

02:38:37.869 --> 02:38:41.292
But it is still a two-story structure.

02:38:42.969 --> 02:38:43.802
Open.

02:38:43.802 --> 02:38:45.079
You can see there is an open doorway

02:38:45.079 --> 02:38:46.219
towards the bottom of the doors,

02:38:46.219 --> 02:38:48.269
pushed off the hinges and busted.

02:38:49.959 --> 02:38:51.009
And that's just where you're standing.

02:38:51.009 --> 02:38:53.539
The rest is beyond your vision, across the way.

02:38:53.539 --> 02:38:55.299
You cannot see the distant--

02:38:55.299 --> 02:38:58.309
ASHLEY: And we're on the ground at this point?
MATT: You're on the ground at this point, yeah.

02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:59.765
ASHLEY: Should we go in there?

02:38:59.765 --> 02:39:00.598
SAM: Yeah, if you think so.

02:39:00.598 --> 02:39:04.129
ASHLEY: I mean, should we tell everybody to come down?

02:39:04.129 --> 02:39:05.302
SAM: How do they get down?

02:39:06.419 --> 02:39:07.703
ASHLEY: We'll figure it out.

02:39:07.703 --> 02:39:08.536
LIAM: (chittering)

02:39:08.536 --> 02:39:09.709
SAM: How long have we travel--

02:39:09.709 --> 02:39:12.289
LIAM: I start playing with Veth's hair as a spider.

02:39:12.289 --> 02:39:13.295
SAM: Get the fricken--

02:39:13.295 --> 02:39:15.089
All right, it's nice, it's nice.

02:39:15.089 --> 02:39:16.489
ASHLEY: I'm going to eat you.

02:39:16.489 --> 02:39:18.098
I'm going to eat you.

02:39:19.219 --> 02:39:20.052
Okay.

02:39:21.119 --> 02:39:24.109
SAM: The total climb from where they are,

02:39:24.109 --> 02:39:26.139
where our friends are to here, is what?

02:39:26.139 --> 02:39:28.846
More than 200 feet at this point, right?

02:39:28.846 --> 02:39:29.679
LIAM: More than 120.

02:39:29.679 --> 02:39:33.249
MATT: I'd say it's about close to 190 feet, considering

02:39:33.249 --> 02:39:36.378
the angle across the ceiling to the base of the--

02:39:36.378 --> 02:39:40.272
SAM: So I can't actually send them a message anymore.

02:39:41.259 --> 02:39:42.092
ASHLEY: You can't?

02:39:42.092 --> 02:39:43.989
SAM: Nope. I mean, they're too far, so.

02:39:43.989 --> 02:39:45.449
ASHLEY: Don't we have the stone?

02:39:45.449 --> 02:39:48.529
SAM: Nope. And even if we did, we only have one stone

02:39:48.529 --> 02:39:50.179
and it can talk to the people outside.

02:39:50.179 --> 02:39:52.209
ASHLEY: That is-- makes all of the sense.

02:39:52.209 --> 02:39:53.152
That's very true.

02:39:54.069 --> 02:39:56.129
SAM: But we can deal with that later.

02:39:56.129 --> 02:39:57.769
I can always just climb back up and tell--

02:39:57.769 --> 02:39:59.214
ASHLEY: Well, sometimes, I've realized that,

02:39:59.214 --> 02:40:00.996
when I talk to somebody, they--

02:40:00.996 --> 02:40:02.579
SAM: You can only do that to me.

02:40:02.579 --> 02:40:03.429
ASHLEY: Ugh, okay.

02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:04.379
SAM: Here, try it now.

02:40:05.849 --> 02:40:07.076
ASHLEY: Well, let me walk over here.

02:40:07.076 --> 02:40:07.909
SAM: Okay.

02:40:07.909 --> 02:40:09.747
(laughter)

02:40:09.747 --> 02:40:11.519
ASHLEY: I walk 10 feet away.
MARISHA: Yasha has no idea

02:40:11.519 --> 02:40:13.302
how communication devices work.

02:40:14.539 --> 02:40:16.136
ASHLEY: (quietly) Uh, Veth can you hear me?

02:40:16.136 --> 02:40:17.427
SAM: (quietly) I can hear you.

02:40:17.427 --> 02:40:18.260
It works!
ASHLEY: Can you hear me?

02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:19.507
SAM: It always worked, yes.

02:40:19.507 --> 02:40:20.619
ASHLEY: Oh, this is so cool.

02:40:20.619 --> 02:40:21.452
SAM: Yep.

02:40:21.452 --> 02:40:24.959
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm coming back
over to you in three, two, one.

02:40:24.959 --> 02:40:27.722
SAM: And then I make it look like we were farther away.

02:40:29.219 --> 02:40:30.919
ASHLEY: Okay. That's really cool.

02:40:30.919 --> 02:40:32.602
Should we investigate this place, then,

02:40:32.602 --> 02:40:33.869
or should we wait?
SAM: Yes, yes, let's go in.

02:40:33.869 --> 02:40:34.702
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: It's the only

02:40:34.702 --> 02:40:36.068
place of interest around, right?

02:40:37.035 --> 02:40:39.699
MATT: That you can see within the proximity of the--

02:40:39.699 --> 02:40:40.789
A lot of the chamber ahead of you,

02:40:40.789 --> 02:40:42.579
you do not see the opposite side of this room.

02:40:42.579 --> 02:40:45.879
It is still in darkness beyond your darkvision sight.

02:40:45.879 --> 02:40:47.589
Aside from the single rope that's still

02:40:47.589 --> 02:40:49.529
in the center of the room that dangles down

02:40:49.529 --> 02:40:50.759
near where that stone bench was

02:40:50.759 --> 02:40:52.532
and a lot of the wreckage.

02:40:53.819 --> 02:40:55.991
SAM AND ASHLEY: Let's go check out this place.

02:40:55.991 --> 02:40:57.456
SAM: Okay.

02:40:57.456 --> 02:40:58.289
ASHLEY: I mean--

02:40:58.289 --> 02:41:00.379
LIAM: Giant spider is actually going to hang back.

02:41:00.379 --> 02:41:01.212
MATT: Okay.

02:41:01.212 --> 02:41:02.799
LIAM: By the base of the wall.

02:41:02.799 --> 02:41:05.065
MATT: You got it.
ASHLEY: Well, should Caleb go get everybody?

02:41:05.065 --> 02:41:06.979
LIAM: (chittering)
SAM: He could.

02:41:06.979 --> 02:41:08.649
That's not a bad idea.

02:41:08.649 --> 02:41:10.199
ASHLEY: Well, we can't tell them what's going on.

02:41:10.199 --> 02:41:11.032
SAM: You're right.

02:41:11.032 --> 02:41:12.059
ASHLEY: All of a sudden he's going to come back there,

02:41:12.059 --> 02:41:13.149
and then the two of us are gone.

02:41:13.149 --> 02:41:15.379
SAM: You could stay down here, I could climb halfway up

02:41:15.379 --> 02:41:17.079
and tell everyone what's going on.

02:41:18.379 --> 02:41:19.212
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:41:20.459 --> 02:41:21.939
'Cause I don't want them to get worried.

02:41:21.939 --> 02:41:23.486
I feel like Beau is going to get worried and be like,

02:41:23.486 --> 02:41:25.359
"Oh, what happened?"

02:41:25.359 --> 02:41:26.969
SAM: Beau's not really a worrier.

02:41:26.969 --> 02:41:28.159
ASHLEY: She's not.

02:41:28.159 --> 02:41:29.029
MARISHA: I'm fine.

02:41:29.029 --> 02:41:29.889
I don't care.

02:41:29.889 --> 02:41:31.039
ASHLEY: Okay, let's check this out.

02:41:31.039 --> 02:41:32.249
SAM: Okay. We'll just check this out.

02:41:32.249 --> 02:41:34.059
ASHLEY: And then we'll go get them.

02:41:34.059 --> 02:41:34.892
SAM: Yeah.

02:41:34.892 --> 02:41:35.835
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll just make sure--
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41:35.835 --> 02:41:36.899
ASHLEY: This is fine.

02:41:36.899 --> 02:41:37.732
SAM: Okay.

02:41:38.919 --> 02:41:40.059
Is the door open?

02:41:40.059 --> 02:41:41.802
Is there a door?

02:41:41.802 --> 02:41:44.369
MATT: There's a splintered door that is off the hinges

02:41:44.369 --> 02:41:47.049
and just scattered along the side of an open arch

02:41:47.049 --> 02:41:49.940
that leads into this room about 25, 30 feet from you.

02:41:49.940 --> 02:41:52.256
SAM: Check that door for traps.

02:41:52.256 --> 02:41:54.009
ASHLEY: Good call.
MATT: Okay.

02:41:54.009 --> 02:41:54.842
SAM: 23.

02:41:54.842 --> 02:41:55.675
MATT: Well, on the way--

02:41:55.675 --> 02:41:57.179
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:41:57.179 --> 02:41:58.929
MATT: I need you to make a constitution

02:41:58.929 --> 02:42:00.009
saving throw for me, please.

02:42:00.009 --> 02:42:03.739
SAM: Sure, sure, that's normal at an empty space.

02:42:03.739 --> 02:42:04.659
ASHLEY: Me too, or?

02:42:04.659 --> 02:42:06.009
SAM: 17.

02:42:06.009 --> 02:42:06.842
MATT: Okay.

02:42:07.789 --> 02:42:08.622
You--

02:42:09.949 --> 02:42:11.239
ASHLEY: Do I make one, too?

02:42:11.239 --> 02:42:12.099
No?

02:42:12.099 --> 02:42:13.392
MATT: Are you moving with him?

02:42:14.339 --> 02:42:15.172
Then yeah.

02:42:15.172 --> 02:42:16.470
ASHLEY: Yeah, I am.

02:42:16.470 --> 02:42:17.380
SAM: What?

02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:18.380
ASHLEY: Because...

02:42:20.724 --> 02:42:21.891
That's cocked.

02:42:21.891 --> 02:42:22.974
LIAM: (chittering that sounds like "oh no")

02:42:22.974 --> 02:42:25.189
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:42:25.189 --> 02:42:27.811
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids ant voice.

02:42:27.811 --> 02:42:28.713
ASHLEY: 22.

02:42:28.713 --> 02:42:30.449
LAURA: This could be a glyph.

02:42:30.449 --> 02:42:34.989
MATT: Okay. You both take nine points of cold damage.

02:42:34.989 --> 02:42:36.133
SAM: Oh, cause it's cold down there.

02:42:36.133 --> 02:42:37.554
ASHLEY: Oh, it's chilly.

02:42:37.554 --> 02:42:40.269
MATT: For whatever reason, as you guys take a few steps,

02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:45.249
the air around you gets extremely freezing, bitingly cold

02:42:45.249 --> 02:42:47.659
and you feel like the temperature in your body

02:42:47.659 --> 02:42:49.739
is just suddenly siphoned from you.

02:42:49.739 --> 02:42:52.899
Your bones seize up, you chatter in your jaw,

02:42:52.899 --> 02:42:55.692
and you don't understand why.

02:42:57.205 --> 02:42:59.705
ASHLEY: It's just freezing down here!

02:42:59.705 --> 02:43:02.354
MATT: Your breath is extremely visible.

02:43:02.354 --> 02:43:04.849
ASHLEY: (breathes) Did you see that?

02:43:04.849 --> 02:43:07.399
SAM: Was it just when we walked towards the building?

02:43:07.399 --> 02:43:10.499
MATT: Yeah. You got maybe 10 feet. It's 20 feet from you.

02:43:10.499 --> 02:43:12.149
SAM: I'll take another step towards it.

02:43:12.149 --> 02:43:13.314
LAURA: Oh, yeah, of course you will.

02:43:13.314 --> 02:43:14.843
TALIESIN: Well, all right.
MATT: Okay.

02:43:15.586 --> 02:43:17.226
MATT: You take another step?
ASHLEY: Uh, Veth?

02:43:17.226 --> 02:43:19.129
SAM: Okay?
MATT: All right.

02:43:20.266 --> 02:43:21.296
SAM: Another step?

02:43:21.296 --> 02:43:22.129
MATT: Okay.

02:43:23.316 --> 02:43:24.936
SAM: Well then, how about I use that Mage Hand

02:43:24.936 --> 02:43:27.186
to sort of touch the door?

02:43:27.186 --> 02:43:29.516
MATT: Okay, it's open, and you touch the door

02:43:29.516 --> 02:43:31.589
and some of the wood, (crumbling)

02:43:31.589 --> 02:43:33.009
falls onto the ground.

02:43:33.934 --> 02:43:35.450
SAM: Seems okay.

02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:37.166
ASHLEY: I think it's fine. I think we should go in.

02:43:37.166 --> 02:43:39.726
SAM: Okay, I'll walk towards the door.

02:43:39.726 --> 02:43:40.559
MATT: Okay.

02:43:41.407 --> 02:43:43.996
TRAVIS: (laughing) You're such assholes.

02:43:43.996 --> 02:43:45.404
MATT: You get to the doorway--
LAURA: Why are you doing this?

02:43:45.404 --> 02:43:48.115
MATT: -- and you can glance inside.
SAM: Just looking at the door.

02:43:48.115 --> 02:43:49.276
LIAM: This is what rogues do.

02:43:49.276 --> 02:43:52.086
MATT: This might have been more

02:43:52.086 --> 02:43:54.406
than a two-story tower at one point,

02:43:54.406 --> 02:43:56.886
but only two stories currently remain.

02:43:56.886 --> 02:43:59.156
You glance inside, and where the roof--

02:43:59.156 --> 02:44:01.396
or where the floor to the second floor would be

02:44:01.396 --> 02:44:03.406
is partially fallen in.

02:44:03.406 --> 02:44:06.056
It is just ruin in here.

02:44:06.056 --> 02:44:10.697
It is structural boards and beams

02:44:10.697 --> 02:44:11.913
just fallen to the ground,

02:44:11.913 --> 02:44:14.099
broken stone and shattered furniture.

02:44:15.106 --> 02:44:16.696
You can see there's a little bit of a path

02:44:16.696 --> 02:44:18.713
that can almost climb up to where the second floor was,

02:44:18.713 --> 02:44:22.936
and a little bit of where the upper platform still remains,

02:44:22.936 --> 02:44:25.269
if it still is load bearing,

02:44:26.226 --> 02:44:29.146
but yeah, just a lot of rubble in here.

02:44:32.103 --> 02:44:35.978
ASHLEY: Don't you want to go up
and look at the second floor?

02:44:35.978 --> 02:44:40.731
The thing is, I'm very big, so-- and you're small.

02:44:40.731 --> 02:44:41.850
SAM: What does that-- what do you mean?

02:44:41.850 --> 02:44:43.058
ASHLEY: Well, I just feel like we don't know

02:44:43.058 --> 02:44:45.346
if it's going to collapse or something with my weight,

02:44:45.346 --> 02:44:48.116
if you would go up there, or I mean, if I go up there.

02:44:48.116 --> 02:44:49.391
SAM: So I should go alone?

02:44:50.536 --> 02:44:51.676
TALIESIN: We're going to need such an expensive

02:44:51.676 --> 02:44:53.572
regeneration, aren't we?

02:44:53.572 --> 02:44:56.065
ASHLEY: I don't know, do you want to go up there?

02:44:56.065 --> 02:44:57.955
SAM: (laughs)

02:44:57.955 --> 02:45:00.486
ASHLEY: I'm volunteering you,
but maybe you don't want to go.

02:45:00.486 --> 02:45:02.396
SAM: Sure, I don't care, yeah.

02:45:02.396 --> 02:45:04.556
ASHLEY: I feel like you, hold on.

02:45:04.556 --> 02:45:08.509
You have a family to get back to, so we need to--

02:45:08.509 --> 02:45:10.496
SAM: This is an empty building.

02:45:10.496 --> 02:45:11.536
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is nothing.

02:45:11.536 --> 02:45:12.586
This is-- there's nothing in here.

02:45:12.586 --> 02:45:13.466
SAM: No.

02:45:13.466 --> 02:45:15.343
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, should we both go?

02:45:15.343 --> 02:45:17.712
TRAVIS: (laughs) Excellent.

02:45:19.425 --> 02:45:21.388
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, let's just go.
TRAVIS: That back and forth.

02:45:21.388 --> 02:45:23.119
ASHLEY: Just go.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:45:23.119 --> 02:45:25.586
MATT: I'm not going to lie, it
shouldn't have taken this long

02:45:25.586 --> 02:45:27.626
for us to really, truly hone in

02:45:27.626 --> 02:45:31.506
to the Yasha-Veth team up dynamic.

02:45:31.506 --> 02:45:33.957
This is beautiful.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:45:35.476 --> 02:45:37.046
SAM: Is there a stairway leading up,

02:45:37.046 --> 02:45:38.873
if I sort of peer in there or do we?

02:45:38.873 --> 02:45:41.226
MATT: You don't see stairs, but a lot of the fallen rubble

02:45:41.226 --> 02:45:44.991
of the precarious interior is possibly climbable

02:45:44.991 --> 02:45:45.974
to get to the--
ASHLEY: There's a whole path for us

02:45:45.974 --> 02:45:47.426
to climb up there.

02:45:47.426 --> 02:45:51.526
It's like how the rubble fell simply for us to go up there.

02:45:51.526 --> 02:45:52.726
SAM: You don't have to convince me.

02:45:52.726 --> 02:45:53.980
ASHLEY: Here I go.

02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:56.286
(laughter)

02:45:56.286 --> 02:45:58.576
MATT: All right, this is a bit of a climbing challenge,

02:45:58.576 --> 02:46:00.406
so I'd like you both to make an athletics check

02:46:00.406 --> 02:46:04.596
to find your way up through the broken interior.

02:46:04.596 --> 02:46:06.424
SAM: 22.

02:46:06.424 --> 02:46:08.176
ASHLEY: Uh, 24.

02:46:08.176 --> 02:46:09.976
SAM: Oh, well.

02:46:09.976 --> 02:46:11.396
MATT: You're both finding handholds

02:46:11.396 --> 02:46:13.816
in large beams of splintered wood,

02:46:13.816 --> 02:46:16.276
and bits of stone that some breaks off,

02:46:16.276 --> 02:46:18.216
and falls back, others hold your weight.

02:46:18.216 --> 02:46:19.436
You pull your way up

02:46:19.436 --> 02:46:22.406
this destroyed hoarder's interior

02:46:22.406 --> 02:46:25.096
of a barely holding tower.

02:46:25.096 --> 02:46:27.116
And eventually climb to the secondary floor,

02:46:27.116 --> 02:46:29.686
where you can see there is a staircase

02:46:29.686 --> 02:46:31.066
that would have led to a third,

02:46:31.066 --> 02:46:32.516
but that is all been pushed off.

02:46:32.516 --> 02:46:34.056
And you gathered some of the rubble

02:46:34.056 --> 02:46:35.976
on the immediate outskirts of this structure

02:46:35.976 --> 02:46:39.056
may have been higher floors that were just laid waste

02:46:39.056 --> 02:46:39.919
as they tumbled.

02:46:41.056 --> 02:46:42.606
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Anything up here?

02:46:42.606 --> 02:46:44.816
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to look
around, see if we can find any--

02:46:44.816 --> 02:46:45.916
MATT: If you want to try and rummage around,

02:46:45.916 --> 02:46:47.066
you can make an investigation check.

02:46:47.066 --> 02:46:49.206
ASHLEY: Yes.
SAM: I will look for traps first.

02:46:49.206 --> 02:46:50.686
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Oh, that's a good idea.

02:46:50.686 --> 02:46:53.486
SAM: Which is a 25.

02:46:53.486 --> 02:46:56.396
MATT: 25, no traps, just the entire place is a trap.

02:46:56.396 --> 02:46:59.436
It's-- it's a very--

02:46:59.436 --> 02:47:01.666
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Yes. (laughs)

02:47:01.666 --> 02:47:02.646
You're like--
SAM: This is a very

02:47:02.646 --> 02:47:04.676
dangerous place.
MARISHA: It's condemned, yeah.

02:47:04.676 --> 02:47:07.436
SAM: Okay, now I'll look for good things.

02:47:07.436 --> 02:47:08.269
MATT: Okay.

02:47:09.826 --> 02:47:12.655
SAM: 28.
MATT: 28.

02:47:12.655 --> 02:47:15.196
ASHLEY: It's just so much darker in here than I can see,

02:47:15.196 --> 02:47:17.079
I think, I can't see anything.

02:47:17.079 --> 02:47:18.929
I couldn't find anything.
SAM: Well, you're tall.

02:47:18.929 --> 02:47:22.224
ASHLEY: I'm tall, it's cramped in here.

02:47:22.224 --> 02:47:23.057
MATT: Okay.

02:47:24.356 --> 02:47:26.351
MARISHA: "I can't see." "It's because you're tall."

02:47:26.351 --> 02:47:27.236
(laughter)

02:47:27.236 --> 02:47:28.876
ASHLEY: The logic is sound.

02:47:28.876 --> 02:47:29.709
TRAVIS: The floor is farther away.

02:47:29.709 --> 02:47:30.886
MATT: Okay.

02:47:30.886 --> 02:47:33.796
ASHLEY: Are these low ceilings or tall floors?

02:47:33.796 --> 02:47:34.629
I can't remember.
(laughter)

02:47:34.629 --> 02:47:37.226
MATT: You do, pushing forward,

02:47:37.226 --> 02:47:40.886
find what looks to be like a robe,

02:47:40.886 --> 02:47:45.539
like a very nice, shimmery, almost silk robe, yeah.

02:47:45.539 --> 02:47:47.706
And you go and find it and pull at it,

02:47:47.706 --> 02:47:50.806
and as you do, you can see the skeletal remains

02:47:50.806 --> 02:47:52.796
of who once wore it, though most of their torso

02:47:52.796 --> 02:47:54.296
and body is currently buried

02:47:54.296 --> 02:47:56.316
beneath some of the broken stone,

02:47:56.316 --> 02:47:58.729
and wood of this collapsed floor.

02:48:00.316 --> 02:48:02.549
Also, I need you both make constitution saving throws again.

02:48:02.549 --> 02:48:04.016
SAM: Oh, so this is a timed--

02:48:04.016 --> 02:48:06.726
LIAM: Get that shit, get that shit.

02:48:06.726 --> 02:48:09.109
SAM: 19 plus two, 21.

02:48:10.206 --> 02:48:14.556
ASHLEY: 17 plus eight, so 25.

02:48:14.556 --> 02:48:17.246
MATT: Okay, you both take 11 points of cold damage,

02:48:17.246 --> 02:48:19.366
but your investigation check reveals that

02:48:19.366 --> 02:48:23.346
around where this robe is in this space,

02:48:23.346 --> 02:48:28.236
there's a fuzzy texture along it, like along the wall,

02:48:28.236 --> 02:48:29.979
like a bit of an odd carpet.

02:48:30.853 --> 02:48:31.686
SAM: I don't like that.

02:48:31.686 --> 02:48:33.646
MATT: Like a darker coloration
than a lot of the nearby stone,

02:48:33.646 --> 02:48:35.916
and as you reached in,

02:48:35.916 --> 02:48:39.056
and the temperature gets bitingly cold again once more,

02:48:39.056 --> 02:48:41.216
you swear you see some of it shift,

02:48:41.216 --> 02:48:42.115
and expand in reaction.

02:48:42.115 --> 02:48:43.606
SAM: Okay, we got to get out of here,
we got to get out of here.

02:48:43.606 --> 02:48:45.036
MATT: Also, as because you were both rummaging,

02:48:45.036 --> 02:48:46.816
I need you both make a dexterity check

02:48:46.816 --> 02:48:48.316
in this precarious place.

02:48:48.316 --> 02:48:49.946
TRAVIS: Remember that last time we were down here,

02:48:49.946 --> 02:48:51.466
and there was a thing up in the cavern

02:48:51.466 --> 02:48:53.186
that we managed not to disturb,

02:48:53.186 --> 02:48:54.156
but it was kind of fuzzy.

02:48:54.156 --> 02:48:55.326
SAM: Dexterity save?

02:48:55.326 --> 02:48:56.869
MATT: Just a check.

02:48:56.869 --> 02:48:57.999
SAM: 24.

02:48:58.836 --> 02:49:03.706
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural 20, so, 24.

02:49:03.706 --> 02:49:07.846
MATT: Great, your rummaging through the piles

02:49:07.846 --> 02:49:11.016
of whatever you could find up here

02:49:11.016 --> 02:49:14.236
did not knock loose any of the load bearing

02:49:14.236 --> 02:49:15.306
elements of the tower,

02:49:15.306 --> 02:49:17.689
so it does not begin to collapse upon you.

02:49:19.926 --> 02:49:21.586
But you do notice this odd presence.

02:49:21.586 --> 02:49:23.126
SAM: We should leave. We should leave here

02:49:23.126 --> 02:49:24.599
because I think that's alive.

02:49:25.656 --> 02:49:27.306
ASHLEY: That thing that's moving, the fur?

02:49:27.306 --> 02:49:29.336
SAM: Yeah, the fur that's moving is probably--

02:49:29.336 --> 02:49:31.776
ASHLEY: Okay, but here's the thing, though.

02:49:31.776 --> 02:49:35.129
What if this silk robe

02:49:35.129 --> 02:49:38.420
on this half-skeleton body

02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:40.341
is the thing that we need to win?

02:49:40.341 --> 02:49:43.428
SAM: This is the clue, this is the clue to Aeor--

02:49:43.428 --> 02:49:46.876
ASHLEY: This is the literal clue. What if it is?

02:49:46.876 --> 02:49:49.458
TRAVIS: Have this conversation here.

02:49:49.458 --> 02:49:53.126
ASHLEY: What if I just move some of the stone

02:49:53.126 --> 02:49:54.989
for you to get the robe?

02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:57.768
What if we just try to like--

02:49:57.768 --> 02:50:00.016
have you ever seen those things, those people--

02:50:00.016 --> 02:50:01.782
SAM: As she's talking, I'm backing away.

02:50:01.782 --> 02:50:04.712
(laughter)

02:50:04.712 --> 02:50:06.476
ASHLEY: Those people, you know, that like--

02:50:06.476 --> 02:50:07.804
they, with a tablecloth--
SAM: What do they do?

02:50:07.804 --> 02:50:09.137
ASHLEY: They go foop.
SAM: What do they do?

02:50:09.137 --> 02:50:11.155
They're like magic people?

02:50:11.155 --> 02:50:14.160
(laughter)

02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:15.446
ASHLEY: You know, they pull out-- where'd you go?

02:50:15.446 --> 02:50:19.466
Are you gone? You left.
(laughter)

02:50:19.466 --> 02:50:20.706
SAM: I'm already downstairs.

02:50:20.706 --> 02:50:23.097
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

02:50:23.097 --> 02:50:23.930
Yasha, what are you doing?

02:50:23.930 --> 02:50:25.916
You're now finding yourself alone,

02:50:25.916 --> 02:50:29.176
freezing in the upper levels of this abandoned,

02:50:29.176 --> 02:50:30.756
partially collapsed tower.

02:50:30.756 --> 02:50:33.576
ASHLEY: I'm going to sniff to see if it's a familiar smell.

02:50:33.576 --> 02:50:35.814
MATT: Okay, okay, make a perception check.

02:50:37.916 --> 02:50:39.519
LAURA: This is how we lose Yasha.

02:50:39.519 --> 02:50:41.439
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Well, probably.

02:50:41.439 --> 02:50:42.759
This is horrible.

02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:45.549
10.

02:50:45.549 --> 02:50:46.498
MATT: 10.
ASHLEY: 10?

02:50:46.498 --> 02:50:47.998
MATT: I mean, it's a little musty.

02:50:49.806 --> 02:50:51.498
You don't recognize anything, though.

02:50:51.498 --> 02:50:55.556
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay, I'll leave.

02:50:55.556 --> 02:50:57.347
I'm going to turn around.

02:50:57.347 --> 02:50:59.034
LAURA: But the robe!

02:50:59.034 --> 02:51:00.886
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Stop it.

02:51:00.886 --> 02:51:03.195
TRAVIS: Silver robe?
LAURA: Silk, it's silk.

02:51:03.195 --> 02:51:08.195
ASHLEY: What if I just do like a quick-- does it look like--

02:51:08.266 --> 02:51:09.976
okay, I just have a really quick question.

02:51:09.976 --> 02:51:10.936
MATT: Yes.

02:51:10.936 --> 02:51:13.216
ASHLEY: Does it-- so does it look like--

02:51:13.216 --> 02:51:16.426
does it look like the robe is like really--

02:51:16.426 --> 02:51:18.424
like it would be a lot of work to pull it out?

02:51:18.424 --> 02:51:22.849
(cackling laughter)

02:51:22.849 --> 02:51:25.836
MARISHA: Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

02:51:25.836 --> 02:51:29.936
MATT: All you see is the arm and shoulder

02:51:29.936 --> 02:51:32.776
of the skeletal body that it is currently on.

02:51:32.776 --> 02:51:36.176
Which means, if you pull hard enough,

02:51:36.176 --> 02:51:37.556
it would probably come free.

02:51:37.556 --> 02:51:39.586
It's not deeply buried, from what you can tell,

02:51:39.586 --> 02:51:41.196
but who knows, everything here is pretty tightly packed.

02:51:41.196 --> 02:51:42.886
SAM: You're super strong.
MATT: You can try it.

02:51:42.886 --> 02:51:44.900
If you want to Bill Murray this, you know.

02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:46.517
ASHLEY: I'm going to fucking Bill Murray it.

02:51:46.517 --> 02:51:48.688
MATT: Okay, roll a strength check for me.
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:51:48.688 --> 02:51:50.386
LIAM: Yasha done got into some Natty Light.
ASHLEY: This is so stupid, this is so stupid.

02:51:50.386 --> 02:51:53.414
SAM: You're doing it, you're doing
it. You're already doing it.

02:51:53.414 --> 02:51:55.306
ASHLEY: This is so stupid, what if I roll bad?

02:51:55.306 --> 02:51:56.256
MATT: Ashley.

02:51:56.256 --> 02:51:58.156
SAM: You're super strong. You're going to be fine!

02:51:58.156 --> 02:51:59.106
LIAM: You know you want to do it.

02:51:59.106 --> 02:52:00.476
ASHLEY: I do want to do it.

02:52:00.476 --> 02:52:01.616
MARISHA: Touch the button.

02:52:01.616 --> 02:52:02.993
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to touch the button.

02:52:02.993 --> 02:52:05.086
TRAVIS: The breathing button.

02:52:09.066 --> 02:52:10.676
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait, what am I?

02:52:10.676 --> 02:52:12.056
I'm adding my strength?

02:52:12.056 --> 02:52:14.569
Okay, that's not bad, that's not bad, that's not bad.

02:52:16.367 --> 02:52:17.766
21.

02:52:17.766 --> 02:52:18.599
MATT: 21.

02:52:19.786 --> 02:52:22.386
You reach out, grab the edge of it.

02:52:22.386 --> 02:52:24.529
I need you to roll a constitution saving throw.

02:52:25.986 --> 02:52:27.485
SAM: But not me downstairs or yes me?

02:52:27.485 --> 02:52:28.810
MATT: Nope, but not you downstairs.

02:52:28.810 --> 02:52:30.977
LIAM: She's touching cold.

02:52:31.906 --> 02:52:33.106
ASHLEY: Fuck, oh no, thank god.

02:52:33.106 --> 02:52:34.526
Okay, oh no, that's still bad.

02:52:34.526 --> 02:52:39.501
I thought it was a one, though, but it's a seven, so 15.

02:52:39.501 --> 02:52:40.334
SAM: Oh, that's not bad.

02:52:40.334 --> 02:52:41.430
ASHLEY: Do I--?
MATT: 15?

02:52:41.430 --> 02:52:43.616
ASHLEY: Because I have-- I'm not holding out my sword, okay.

02:52:43.616 --> 02:52:45.606
MATT: No, you take eight points of cold damage.

02:52:45.606 --> 02:52:47.756
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
MATT: Once again, this freezing pulse,

02:52:47.756 --> 02:52:51.226
like part of your life heat is being drawn out of you,

02:52:51.226 --> 02:52:54.359
and it's weird because it comes in waves.

02:52:55.326 --> 02:52:58.036
And you're not sure, but your hand is on the robe,

02:52:58.036 --> 02:53:01.236
and you tug, and whoosh, you pull it free.

02:53:01.236 --> 02:53:03.569
It comes out, whoosh!

02:53:04.426 --> 02:53:06.089
(crumbling) Some of the rocks come and settle.

02:53:06.089 --> 02:53:07.690
LAURA: (gasps) What?

02:53:07.690 --> 02:53:08.915
MATT: (rumbling)
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to--

02:53:08.915 --> 02:53:11.306
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh.

02:53:11.306 --> 02:53:12.256
MATT: Roll a dexterity saving throw

02:53:12.256 --> 02:53:14.366
as the entire tower begins to rumble,

02:53:14.366 --> 02:53:16.182
and collapse around you.

02:53:16.182 --> 02:53:18.866
MATT: (roaring crash)
ASHLEY: Oh, this fucking robe. Okay.

02:53:18.866 --> 02:53:20.305
SAM: Am I dead, am I free, or am I?

02:53:20.305 --> 02:53:21.816
ASHLEY: Okay, I have advantage.

02:53:21.816 --> 02:53:24.906
MATT: You also have to make a dexterity saving throw,

02:53:24.906 --> 02:53:25.796
but you have advantage on it,

02:53:25.796 --> 02:53:27.376
because you are in the lower floor.

02:53:27.376 --> 02:53:28.805
ASHLEY: 21.
MATT: 21.

02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:31.856
SAM: 24.
MATT: 24.

02:53:31.856 --> 02:53:34.036
You, grabbing the robe, are running, running down,

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:37.372
as you look up, Veth, and you see behind Yasha--

02:53:37.372 --> 02:53:38.836
(crashing)

02:53:38.836 --> 02:53:40.070
You both go charging--
SAM: What did you do?

02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:43.055
ASHLEY: I got the robe!
(laughter)

02:53:43.055 --> 02:53:44.534
SAM: You broke the house!

02:53:44.534 --> 02:53:45.367
ASHLEY: I got the robe!

02:53:45.367 --> 02:53:46.725
I got the robe!
SAM: Get out of here!

02:53:46.725 --> 02:53:49.446
MATT: (laughs) You both go charging out of the tower,

02:53:49.446 --> 02:53:52.949
and leap just as you hear it (crashing) behind you.

02:53:52.949 --> 02:53:56.926
Boof, all this dust comes billowing out of the collapse,

02:53:56.926 --> 02:53:58.406
and immediately fills the chamber

02:53:58.406 --> 02:54:01.536
with this opaque atmosphere around you,

02:54:01.536 --> 02:54:02.500
as you (coughs) cough and cough.

02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:04.230
TRAVIS: Cough, bitches.

02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:07.216
ASHLEY and SAM: (cough)

02:54:07.216 --> 02:54:08.049
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:54:08.049 --> 02:54:09.896
SAM: Think our friends heard that?

02:54:09.896 --> 02:54:12.896
MATT: You guys hear this heavy echo of a collapsing

02:54:12.896 --> 02:54:14.813
loud boom after boom.

02:54:14.813 --> 02:54:15.916
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no!

02:54:15.916 --> 02:54:17.516
TALIESIN: Oh no, get the diamonds ready.

02:54:18.409 --> 02:54:20.096
LAURA: Should we, should we go down?

02:54:20.096 --> 02:54:21.299
TALIESIN: How?
MARISHA: Yeah, you can't--

02:54:21.299 --> 02:54:23.549
LAURA: I can turn into a spider!

02:54:25.850 --> 02:54:27.483
MARISHA: Eh.

02:54:27.483 --> 02:54:29.416
(laughter)

02:54:29.416 --> 02:54:31.596
SAM: Your friends went down into a pit of despair,

02:54:31.596 --> 02:54:33.171
and you heard an explosion sound.

02:54:33.171 --> 02:54:34.645
LAURA: I'm going to turn into a spider.
SAM: They're fine.

02:54:34.645 --> 02:54:36.556
LAURA: We have no idea what's going on.

02:54:36.556 --> 02:54:39.066
TRAVIS: I can fly one of us down there.

02:54:39.066 --> 02:54:42.583
LAURA: Okay, so I'll turn into a spider and carry Beau,

02:54:42.583 --> 02:54:43.858
because she's lighter.
MARISHA: All right.

02:54:43.858 --> 02:54:45.516
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: You want a ride?

02:54:45.516 --> 02:54:47.346
TALIESIN: You can carry two in theory, can't you?

02:54:47.346 --> 02:54:48.356
LAURA: Sure.
LIAM: I have carried two.

02:54:48.356 --> 02:54:49.846
TALIESIN: So.

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:50.986
LAURA: Oh, but yes, Essek can float.

02:54:50.986 --> 02:54:51.819
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

02:54:51.819 --> 02:54:54.044
LAURA: But yes, I can also carry a second with me.

02:54:54.044 --> 02:54:55.052
TALIESIN: So I'll go with Fjord, then.

02:54:55.052 --> 02:54:55.885
MATT: "I think I'll be all right."

02:54:55.885 --> 02:54:56.718
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:54:56.718 --> 02:54:57.606
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

02:54:57.606 --> 02:54:59.439
LIAM: We all float down here.

02:54:59.439 --> 02:55:02.090
TRAVIS: (chuckles) Uh-huh.
LAURA: (chittering) I can do it, I can do it.

02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:03.861
MATT: All right, so.

02:55:03.861 --> 02:55:05.656
ASHLEY: Do the noises.

02:55:05.656 --> 02:55:08.476
MATT: As the spider riders make their way down to--

02:55:08.476 --> 02:55:11.396
Essek steps off and begins to glide down,

02:55:11.396 --> 02:55:12.846
but Essek also puts a hand around

02:55:12.846 --> 02:55:15.636
the the free-hanging rope as just a backup.

02:55:15.636 --> 02:55:17.716
So he's just keeping it loose,

02:55:17.716 --> 02:55:18.786
but in case anything gets weird,

02:55:18.786 --> 02:55:20.406
he's just keeping it nearby.

02:55:20.406 --> 02:55:22.391
TALIESIN: Essek's keeping it?
MATT: He is.

02:55:23.366 --> 02:55:25.826
So while you guys are descending rapidly,

02:55:25.826 --> 02:55:27.136
what are you doing?

02:55:27.136 --> 02:55:29.371
SAM: (laid back accent) What are you doing?

02:55:29.371 --> 02:55:30.236
(laughter)

02:55:30.236 --> 02:55:32.569
What just happened in there? What'd you do?

02:55:33.546 --> 02:55:38.546
ASHLEY: I grabbed the robe, and then the house collapsed.

02:55:38.756 --> 02:55:40.200
Or what, the tower, whatever it is.

02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:41.316
SAM: Can we at least see the robe?

02:55:41.316 --> 02:55:42.496
Wait, I'm going to look around.

02:55:42.496 --> 02:55:46.326
Does anyone-- is anyone looking at us, or is any creatures?

02:55:46.326 --> 02:55:47.619
MATT: You see a giant spider.

02:55:47.619 --> 02:55:49.076
SAM: (shrieks)

02:55:49.076 --> 02:55:50.976
ASHLEY: Ah! It's Caleb.

02:55:50.976 --> 02:55:51.816
SAM: Anything else?

02:55:51.816 --> 02:55:52.936
ASHLEY: Wait, did you say it was pink?

02:55:52.936 --> 02:55:54.229
Or am I making that up about the robe?

02:55:54.229 --> 02:55:56.616
MATT: No-- well, you don't see color right now,

02:55:56.616 --> 02:55:58.366
there's no light source.

02:55:58.366 --> 02:56:00.806
So it's just a shimmering silk robe.

02:56:00.806 --> 02:56:02.013
And as you pull up and look at it,

02:56:02.013 --> 02:56:04.526
it is shredded underneath.

02:56:04.526 --> 02:56:06.846
Like, you managed to pull it through--

02:56:06.846 --> 02:56:07.679
ASHLEY: But ruined it.

02:56:07.679 --> 02:56:09.166
MATT: But it got ruined in the process.

02:56:09.166 --> 02:56:12.226
LAURA: Oh no, it's ruined?

02:56:12.226 --> 02:56:13.161
MATT: Hmm?

02:56:13.161 --> 02:56:14.446
TRAVIS: What was breathing on the wall just above them?

02:56:14.446 --> 02:56:16.605
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: We don't know.

02:56:16.605 --> 02:56:17.996
ASHLEY: It was just someone's house robe.

02:56:17.996 --> 02:56:19.493
MATT: It's in a bunch of rubble now.

02:56:19.493 --> 02:56:20.709
LAURA: No, it would've totally decayed.

02:56:20.709 --> 02:56:21.900
It would've been destroyed

02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:23.586
if it wasn't magic.

02:56:23.586 --> 02:56:25.406
That thing would be totally--

02:56:25.406 --> 02:56:27.246
SAM: Silk can last a long time.

02:56:27.246 --> 02:56:30.019
LAURA: It wouldn't last like that. This is magic for sure.

02:56:33.536 --> 02:56:36.564
ASHLEY: Okay, well, we have the answer to Aeor.

02:56:37.526 --> 02:56:39.156
That's for sure. It's this robe.
SAM: We certainly do.

02:56:39.156 --> 02:56:44.156
We do. It's a half moth-eaten kimono.

02:56:44.706 --> 02:56:47.574
That is the key to unlocking the mystical origin.

02:56:47.574 --> 02:56:49.066
MATT: Okay, so you're flying down.

02:56:49.066 --> 02:56:50.726
TRAVIS: Yes, yep.
MATT: Right?

02:56:50.726 --> 02:56:53.990
All right, so (doosh) sword glowing.

02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:55.126
TRAVIS: Sword glowing.

02:56:55.126 --> 02:56:57.946
MATT: Emerging, much like Gandalf and the Balrog

02:56:57.946 --> 02:56:59.636
as they tumble into the expanse,

02:56:59.636 --> 02:57:01.846
you watch as Fjord, sword glowing,

02:57:01.846 --> 02:57:04.186
just fires out from the top of the tunnel,

02:57:04.186 --> 02:57:06.726
this glowing aura, and then quickly behind,

02:57:06.726 --> 02:57:11.016
you see Essek drifting from the top

02:57:11.016 --> 02:57:14.376
with his own glowing mystique.

02:57:14.376 --> 02:57:15.456
One hand at his torso,

02:57:15.456 --> 02:57:16.516
the other clutching the rope

02:57:16.516 --> 02:57:18.606
as he lets it just slide through his grip.

02:57:18.606 --> 02:57:21.914
And a secondary spider emerges and curls underneath,

02:57:21.914 --> 02:57:24.316
and begins carefully--

02:57:24.316 --> 02:57:27.089
If you wouldn't mind making an athletics check

02:57:27.089 --> 02:57:29.827
for the spider form to climb down.

02:57:30.936 --> 02:57:34.221
LAURA: A blue dice because it's a blue spider.

02:57:36.306 --> 02:57:38.236
Athletics? 14?

02:57:38.236 --> 02:57:43.126
MATT: 14, okay, manage to carefully
navigate, but do so well.

02:57:43.126 --> 02:57:48.126
Slowly, but you both, you and Essek emerge first.

02:57:48.310 --> 02:57:51.586
For the rest of the group, you see the Caleb spider,

02:57:51.586 --> 02:57:53.156
the dust is now starting to settle a bit.

02:57:53.156 --> 02:57:56.106
You can see some of the rocks are just beginning to settle,

02:57:57.556 --> 02:57:59.556
and there is a collapsed structure

02:57:59.556 --> 02:58:01.266
amongst all the rubble around here.

02:58:01.266 --> 02:58:04.346
It is a ruined courtyard from a time long forgotten.

02:58:04.346 --> 02:58:06.586
TRAVIS: Looking back and seeing the spider making its way

02:58:06.586 --> 02:58:09.548
with Beau and--
LAURA: Dangling.

02:58:09.548 --> 02:58:10.513
TRAVIS: -- Caduceus, yeah.

02:58:10.513 --> 02:58:11.836
LAURA: Caduceus is not on me--
TALIESIN: I'm with you.

02:58:11.836 --> 02:58:12.836
LAURA: Caduceus was flying with you.

02:58:12.836 --> 02:58:14.556
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, no, you're with me, sorry.

02:58:14.556 --> 02:58:17.046
We'll head down to where the (laughs) others are,

02:58:17.046 --> 02:58:19.516
amongst the rubble, sword glowing to cast

02:58:19.516 --> 02:58:21.576
some light on the area.

02:58:21.576 --> 02:58:24.386
Is there anything creeping up on our friends,

02:58:24.386 --> 02:58:25.876
or at the periphery of that light?

02:58:25.876 --> 02:58:27.814
MATT: You can make a perception check.

02:58:27.814 --> 02:58:32.313
LIAM: I high-pitched screech
to the other spider. (screeches)

02:58:32.313 --> 02:58:33.324
LAURA: (screeches)

02:58:33.324 --> 02:58:36.886
(laughter)

02:58:36.886 --> 02:58:38.626
ASHLEY: There it is.
MARISHA: That's pretty good, though.

02:58:38.626 --> 02:58:40.018
ASHLEY: That is pretty good.

02:58:41.351 --> 02:58:42.766
TRAVIS: 18.
TALIESIN: 26.

02:58:42.766 --> 02:58:44.206
MATT: Well, the thing you notice--
TRAVIS: 46?!

02:58:44.206 --> 02:58:45.376
TALIESIN: 26.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:58:45.376 --> 02:58:48.136
MATT: You notice as you arrive and the light expands,

02:58:48.136 --> 02:58:50.536
what you didn't see with just darkvision

02:58:50.536 --> 02:58:55.444
is the endless glittering

02:58:55.444 --> 02:58:58.769
of ice across everything--

02:58:58.769 --> 02:59:00.366
TALIESIN: Oh no.
MATT: -- in the rubble here.

02:59:00.366 --> 02:59:05.286
Like a million diamonds just surrounding the space.

02:59:05.286 --> 02:59:09.196
As the light from the vestige blade

02:59:09.196 --> 02:59:12.316
expands into the surrounding area,

02:59:12.316 --> 02:59:14.296
you can see there are patches of brown dirt

02:59:14.296 --> 02:59:15.656
beneath some of the ice that gives it

02:59:15.656 --> 02:59:18.516
a camouflaged look, where the space around you,

02:59:18.516 --> 02:59:20.316
it mingles from the white

02:59:20.316 --> 02:59:22.736
in the different colors of the stonework.

02:59:22.736 --> 02:59:24.876
It gives a swampy aspect to it.

02:59:24.876 --> 02:59:28.146
And you can see where the fallen tower pieces

02:59:28.146 --> 02:59:31.156
now create this giant pile of wreckage.

02:59:31.156 --> 02:59:33.256
How far is the distance in the--?

02:59:33.256 --> 02:59:34.746
TRAVIS: 30 feet for light from the sword.

02:59:34.746 --> 02:59:36.766
MATT: 30 feet, you'd have to get, you still cannot not see

02:59:36.766 --> 02:59:38.586
across the other side of the chamber.

02:59:38.586 --> 02:59:43.196
But Essek has landed, and

02:59:51.610 --> 02:59:53.936
Essek yells out briefly.

02:59:53.936 --> 02:59:57.666
He goes, "(groans) There is--

02:59:59.864 --> 03:00:01.909
"There is something curious here."

03:00:03.580 --> 03:00:04.833
LAURA: (gurgles)

03:00:04.833 --> 03:00:06.586
MARISHA: What do you mean?
SAM: Yes, there's lots of curious things.

03:00:06.586 --> 03:00:09.376
We've been feeling a bitter cold sensation

03:00:09.376 --> 03:00:10.680
since we got down here.

03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:13.305
ASHLEY: Bitter cold, yeah,

03:00:13.305 --> 03:00:17.846
a movement of some fur, and--

03:00:17.846 --> 03:00:19.961
SAM: This structure just collapsed on its own

03:00:19.961 --> 03:00:21.186
when we got down here.

03:00:21.186 --> 03:00:23.336
ASHLEY: But we did find this robe.

03:00:23.336 --> 03:00:25.486
SAM: It's the key to unlocking the Somnovem.

03:00:25.486 --> 03:00:27.386
ASHLEY: Yep.
MARISHA: Oh, let me see it?

03:00:27.386 --> 03:00:30.110
TRAVIS: Essek, what were you going to say?

03:00:30.110 --> 03:00:31.136
(laughter)

03:00:31.136 --> 03:00:33.726
MATT: As he's talking, you can see his breath

03:00:33.726 --> 03:00:36.516
is emerging like a cold cloud.

03:00:36.516 --> 03:00:41.186
Like this is the coldest of blizzards across Eiselcross.

03:00:42.656 --> 03:00:47.306
That type of density of cold breath,

03:00:47.306 --> 03:00:50.106
but in the middle of a chamber that does not seem that cold.

03:00:50.106 --> 03:00:52.124
And you see him shivering,

03:00:52.124 --> 03:00:53.066
just floating the air a bit,

03:00:53.066 --> 03:00:58.066
going, "This is a very odd sensation."

03:00:58.206 --> 03:01:00.406
ASHLEY: Are you--
MARISHA: Is there something here

03:01:00.406 --> 03:01:02.423
we can't see?

03:01:02.423 --> 03:01:03.696
MATT: "I-- I don't know."

03:01:03.696 --> 03:01:05.116
TALIESIN: Detect Magic. (snaps fingers)

03:01:05.116 --> 03:01:07.554
MARISHA: Thank you.
TRAVIS: He snaps.

03:01:07.554 --> 03:01:08.387
MARISHA and LAURA: (snap fingers)

03:01:08.387 --> 03:01:11.806
MATT: (laughs) That's my favorite somatic component

03:01:11.806 --> 03:01:14.656
for a spell right there.
TALIESIN: (snaps fingers)

03:01:14.656 --> 03:01:16.826
MATT: You do not sense anything magical

03:01:16.826 --> 03:01:18.826
other than what you've brought with you.

03:01:19.823 --> 03:01:20.656
MARISHA: Huh.

03:01:20.656 --> 03:01:23.166
TALIESIN: So nothing on the robe, is what you're saying.

03:01:23.166 --> 03:01:24.043
MATT: The robe is not magic.
TALIESIN: The robe is not magic.

03:01:24.043 --> 03:01:26.226
ASHLEY: Essek, if you are cold,

03:01:26.226 --> 03:01:28.281
I happen to have a robe on me.

03:01:28.281 --> 03:01:31.478
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:01:31.478 --> 03:01:34.792
TALIESIN: Is anybody else getting, like, a--?

03:01:34.792 --> 03:01:36.505
MATT: Wait, and what'd you roll perception?

03:01:36.505 --> 03:01:37.776
TALIESIN: 26.
MATT: 26.

03:01:37.776 --> 03:01:41.346
As this is happening, you look beneath this,

03:01:41.346 --> 03:01:43.286
the glittering diamonds, and amongst the rubble

03:01:43.286 --> 03:01:46.946
of rock and stone, it's hard to see until you really focus,

03:01:46.946 --> 03:01:49.379
bones, many bones.

03:01:49.379 --> 03:01:50.287
TALIESIN: I'm going to light the staff--

03:01:50.287 --> 03:01:54.456
MATT: Numerous bones, bent, withered, like boiled leather,

03:01:54.456 --> 03:01:59.166
frozen beneath this dusting of diamond.

03:01:59.166 --> 03:02:03.706
And the patches of brown beneath the ice,

03:02:03.706 --> 03:02:08.066
you can tell in areas have an odd fuzzy texture to them

03:02:08.066 --> 03:02:09.209
like a mold.

03:02:11.736 --> 03:02:13.076
TALIESIN: This is giving me a bad,

03:02:13.076 --> 03:02:16.886
like, dragon's lair, weird shit vibe.

03:02:16.886 --> 03:02:20.396
We should get out of here. This is not good.

03:02:20.396 --> 03:02:23.776
LAURA: Do we see exits? Any way to get out of this?

03:02:23.776 --> 03:02:25.816
SAM: There's a whole half of the chamber we can't see,

03:02:25.816 --> 03:02:26.847
because it's too dark, so--

03:02:26.847 --> 03:02:28.676
MATT: Essek, who is in the middle of the chamber,

03:02:28.676 --> 03:02:30.586
because he's the only one that descended straight down,

03:02:30.586 --> 03:02:33.686
while the rest of you went along to the far wall,

03:02:33.686 --> 03:02:34.616
where you came.

03:02:34.616 --> 03:02:38.739
He says, "There is an archway on the opposite side this way,

03:02:39.756 --> 03:02:41.206
"but--"
SAM: Let's get out of here.

03:02:42.556 --> 03:02:43.476
TRAVIS: True.
LAURA: I feel-- oh, shit.

03:02:43.476 --> 03:02:45.226
LIAM: Caleb spider is going to start going over

03:02:45.226 --> 03:02:47.596
the arch of the ceiling in that direction.

03:02:47.596 --> 03:02:49.756
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Want to take someone with you, or--?

03:02:49.756 --> 03:02:52.724
TRAVIS: Are we wanting to leave this room before we use it?

03:02:53.586 --> 03:02:54.419
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:02:54.419 --> 03:02:55.976
SAM: You mean, to put traps here?

03:02:55.976 --> 03:02:57.971
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: I think this is a trap.

03:02:58.926 --> 03:03:00.506
TRAVIS: It could be one to our advantage.

03:03:00.506 --> 03:03:01.339
SAM: Sure.

03:03:01.339 --> 03:03:02.976
TRAVIS: Falling that distance.

03:03:02.976 --> 03:03:04.496
MARISHA: I still don't hate the idea of putting

03:03:04.496 --> 03:03:06.923
the intuit charges at the top of the tunnel.

03:03:06.923 --> 03:03:09.116
TRAVIS: Her glyph and the intuit charge are both 60 feet,

03:03:09.116 --> 03:03:11.016
if you put it on the underside of that tunnel

03:03:11.016 --> 03:03:12.916
as they're coming down, it'll catch them as they're coming.

03:03:12.916 --> 03:03:17.434
They won't see it, and they will, in essence, fall.

03:03:18.456 --> 03:03:20.966
MARISHA: We can almost Rube Goldberg device it

03:03:20.966 --> 03:03:25.239
is what you're thinking, like, boom, boom?

03:03:28.426 --> 03:03:33.426
This whole thing does feel like a slow siphoning trap.

03:03:33.711 --> 03:03:36.076
It's got to be something with the moss, right?

03:03:36.076 --> 03:03:38.626
TALIESIN: We need to get out of here soon.

03:03:38.626 --> 03:03:41.306
SAM: So why don't we set the glyphs and go?

03:03:41.306 --> 03:03:45.036
Although we only get one shot at these bombs, right?

03:03:45.036 --> 03:03:47.346
TALIESIN: Let's stay against the wall for now,

03:03:47.346 --> 03:03:48.406
and let's see, what--

03:03:48.406 --> 03:03:49.951
MATT: Caduceus, make a nature check.

03:03:49.951 --> 03:03:52.051
TALIESIN: Oof, really?
MATT: Yeah.

03:03:52.051 --> 03:03:55.546
ASHLEY: (laughs)

03:03:55.546 --> 03:03:57.138
TALIESIN: Oh shit, that's an 18.

03:03:57.138 --> 03:03:58.938
That's almost as high as I can roll.

03:03:59.966 --> 03:04:01.126
MATT: Total 18?
MARISHA: You have any bonuses?

03:04:01.126 --> 03:04:02.366
TALIESIN: I have an 18.

03:04:02.366 --> 03:04:03.376
MATT: That's actually really good.

03:04:03.376 --> 03:04:04.796
TALIESIN: I have negative one.

03:04:04.796 --> 03:04:06.706
MATT: This is indeed mold.

03:04:06.706 --> 03:04:09.826
This isn't your normal mold.

03:04:09.826 --> 03:04:13.616
This you've not seen before,

03:04:13.616 --> 03:04:15.089
but you've read it in books,

03:04:16.401 --> 03:04:19.206
and you've come across samples of it

03:04:19.206 --> 03:04:22.196
contained by herbalists and such.

03:04:22.196 --> 03:04:24.106
It's referred to as brown mold,

03:04:24.106 --> 03:04:27.056
and it is an unnatural fungus

03:04:27.056 --> 03:04:31.039
that is drawn towards heat

03:04:31.039 --> 03:04:32.766
and consumes it.

03:04:32.766 --> 03:04:33.696
MARISHA: Oh shit.

03:04:33.696 --> 03:04:35.752
TALIESIN: We should stay away from the mold,

03:04:35.752 --> 03:04:37.484
and it's going to keep coming towards us.

03:04:37.484 --> 03:04:39.589
Does anybody else know what brown mold is?

03:04:40.806 --> 03:04:42.168
MARISHA: Do I know what brown mold is?

03:04:42.168 --> 03:04:45.004
MATT: If anybody else is trained in nature.

03:04:46.086 --> 03:04:47.086
MARISHA: No.

03:04:47.086 --> 03:04:48.599
LIAM: I'm a spider.

03:04:48.599 --> 03:04:49.476
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: I'm a spider!

03:04:49.476 --> 03:04:51.356
LIAM: I'm also, probably at this point,

03:04:51.356 --> 03:04:53.006
into the region that we couldn't see into,

03:04:53.006 --> 03:04:54.916
because while everyone was talking--

03:04:54.916 --> 03:04:56.546
MATT: Correct.

03:04:56.546 --> 03:04:57.553
Make a perception check.
LAURA: Are you still on

03:04:57.553 --> 03:05:00.546
my back, Beau, just talking to everyone?

03:05:00.546 --> 03:05:01.576
Or did you drop?

03:05:01.576 --> 03:05:02.596
MARISHA: I think I'm still on your back.

03:05:02.596 --> 03:05:04.066
LAURA: Okay.

03:05:04.066 --> 03:05:05.366
TALIESIN: Is there any part of the room

03:05:05.366 --> 03:05:07.913
that's far enough away from the mold patches,

03:05:07.913 --> 03:05:10.336
where we can take some purchase for a little bit?

03:05:10.336 --> 03:05:14.069
MATT: I mean, where you are now is pretty safe.

03:05:15.046 --> 03:05:17.286
Stepping in towards the center of the chamber,

03:05:17.286 --> 03:05:20.796
and glancing over where Essek is, it's patchwork.

03:05:20.796 --> 03:05:23.466
There's little five-foot channels between them,

03:05:23.466 --> 03:05:24.856
five- to 10-foot channels between them,

03:05:24.856 --> 03:05:28.296
but the patches are throughout this chamber.

03:05:28.296 --> 03:05:31.166
It's a bit of a hopscotch.

03:05:31.166 --> 03:05:35.416
TALIESIN: Essek, the brown stuff is heat-sensing

03:05:35.416 --> 03:05:36.498
and mildly carnivorous.

03:05:36.498 --> 03:05:37.940
You probably want to get away from it

03:05:37.940 --> 03:05:39.256
as soon as possible.

03:05:39.256 --> 03:05:42.666
MATT: "Fair enough. Should I come to you, or am I,"

03:05:42.666 --> 03:05:45.259
he glances up at the spider, "following them?"

03:05:47.726 --> 03:05:50.276
TALIESIN: Do you guys, do you guys need some help up there?

03:05:51.146 --> 03:05:53.964
I don't know, make some web if you do.

03:05:53.964 --> 03:05:55.416
MATT: Well, are Yasha and Veth up with you,

03:05:55.416 --> 03:05:56.249
or is just you going?

03:05:56.249 --> 03:05:58.196
MATT: No, it was just me, I'm out on my own.

03:05:58.196 --> 03:05:59.266
LAURA: I have Beau.

03:05:59.266 --> 03:06:01.276
MATT: So the spider does not respond. (laughs)

03:06:01.276 --> 03:06:05.006
TALIESIN: Oh. I guess stay with us just in case for now.

03:06:05.006 --> 03:06:06.346
They'll make noise if they need us.

03:06:06.346 --> 03:06:07.896
LAURA: I don't know how to make web.

03:06:09.053 --> 03:06:09.886
TALIESIN: Every spider knows how to make--

03:06:09.886 --> 03:06:11.808
LAURA: That's what I'm thinking in my head.

03:06:11.808 --> 03:06:12.641
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:06:12.641 --> 03:06:13.913
TALIESIN: How do you-- okay.

03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:17.302
MATT: You did roll an 18.
TALIESIN: Hmm?

03:06:17.302 --> 03:06:19.189
MATT: You rolled an 18.
TALIESIN: I rolled a 19.

03:06:19.189 --> 03:06:20.178
MATT: Oh, you rolled a 19?

03:06:20.178 --> 03:06:21.186
TALIESIN: Yeah, and that's an 18 for me.

03:06:21.186 --> 03:06:22.019
MATT: That's pretty high.

03:06:22.019 --> 03:06:23.906
You don't just recognize it,

03:06:23.906 --> 03:06:25.716
but you know that it's drawn to heat,

03:06:25.716 --> 03:06:27.448
and will expand to heat specifically,

03:06:27.448 --> 03:06:29.256
like bright heat, like fire.

03:06:29.256 --> 03:06:32.106
So that can cause it to expand and spread, which is bad.

03:06:33.336 --> 03:06:36.856
Ironically, it's the cold that it leaves behind,

03:06:36.856 --> 03:06:39.719
in intense ways, can repel it.

03:06:40.836 --> 03:06:43.026
TALIESIN: The cold-- wait.
MARISHA: It can repel?

03:06:43.026 --> 03:06:44.676
TALIESIN: Like, cold will make it--?

03:06:44.676 --> 03:06:48.566
MATT: An extreme, focused, intense lack of heat.

03:06:48.566 --> 03:06:50.016
LIAM: Like Cone of Cold or something.

03:06:50.016 --> 03:06:50.849
TALIESIN: Like if anybody had--

03:06:50.849 --> 03:06:53.916
MATT: Enough to do cold damage would likely repel it.

03:06:53.916 --> 03:06:57.086
TALIESIN: So cold damage is something that would actually--

03:06:57.086 --> 03:06:57.919
SAM: Chase it away.

03:06:57.919 --> 03:07:00.289
TALIESIN: If anybody has an ice spell

03:07:00.289 --> 03:07:01.555
or some sort of cold spell,

03:07:01.555 --> 03:07:03.876
that's the best way to get this stuff to back off.

03:07:03.876 --> 03:07:04.986
TRAVIS: I do.

03:07:04.986 --> 03:07:06.506
TALIESIN: You do?

03:07:06.506 --> 03:07:07.456
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:07:07.456 --> 03:07:10.706
MARISHA: Well, are we going into this tunnel?

03:07:11.696 --> 03:07:13.846
ASHLEY: So the arch is behind us?

03:07:13.846 --> 03:07:15.715
MATT: Yeah. So based on where you were,

03:07:15.715 --> 03:07:20.303
the tower was on the southern side of this interior chamber.

03:07:20.303 --> 03:07:21.986
Essek pointed out, and you're starting to see it

03:07:21.986 --> 03:07:24.226
with your spider vision, on the opposite end,

03:07:24.226 --> 03:07:26.536
there is a metallic archway,

03:07:26.536 --> 03:07:28.878
what looked to be a continued hall,

03:07:28.878 --> 03:07:29.777
or at least an entranceway

03:07:29.777 --> 03:07:32.136
into a hall of another much larger structure

03:07:32.136 --> 03:07:36.206
beyond the tower, that this courtyard ends at.

03:07:36.206 --> 03:07:38.866
But it looks like a heavy rock shelf is pressed into it,

03:07:38.866 --> 03:07:40.846
and the archway is bent down,

03:07:40.846 --> 03:07:42.376
leaving almost a triangular entrance,

03:07:42.376 --> 03:07:46.081
but it continues onward into a wider hall.

03:07:46.081 --> 03:07:47.666
LIAM: And you said metallic?

03:07:47.666 --> 03:07:48.516
MATT: Yes.

03:07:48.516 --> 03:07:52.126
LIAM: That's-- we're crossing into Aeor if we go further.

03:07:52.126 --> 03:07:55.167
SAM: Which is good, if we set some traps here,

03:07:56.306 --> 03:08:00.136
we can hit them, and then we could be maybe just outside.

03:08:00.136 --> 03:08:02.786
I mean, just beyond that door threshold.

03:08:02.786 --> 03:08:04.086
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: They'll be running from

03:08:04.086 --> 03:08:08.086
these traps and the cold mold.

03:08:08.086 --> 03:08:08.919
TALIESIN: I'll tell you.

03:08:08.919 --> 03:08:10.536
SAM: And then when they go through the metal doors,

03:08:10.536 --> 03:08:11.896
we just (rapid shooting).

03:08:11.896 --> 03:08:13.366
TALIESIN: Psychic hit up there,

03:08:13.366 --> 03:08:16.208
and then there's something that creates heat right above it.

03:08:16.208 --> 03:08:18.118
SAM: Yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking.

03:08:18.118 --> 03:08:19.926
SAM: Jester's glyph.

03:08:19.926 --> 03:08:22.239
MARISHA: I don't think we should get rid of the mold,

03:08:22.239 --> 03:08:23.496
I think we should encourage it.

03:08:23.496 --> 03:08:24.329
SAM: I agree.

03:08:24.329 --> 03:08:25.736
TALIESIN: The ice will get us through,

03:08:25.736 --> 03:08:28.596
but if they land into a big heat spot,

03:08:28.596 --> 03:08:31.126
that's a big problem for them.

03:08:31.126 --> 03:08:33.286
MARISHA: Are we going to set these traps,

03:08:33.286 --> 03:08:35.476
and try and whittle them down, and ambush them later?

03:08:35.476 --> 03:08:37.119
Or trap and ambush at the same time?

03:08:37.119 --> 03:08:38.486
SAM: It'd have to be at the same time,

03:08:38.486 --> 03:08:42.108
because we don't want them to be able to heal and regroup.

03:08:42.108 --> 03:08:42.941
LIAM: (affirmative gurgle)

03:08:42.941 --> 03:08:44.556
MARISHA: So are we going to fight them in this chamber?

03:08:44.556 --> 03:08:46.180
TRAVIS: It depends, we don't know

03:08:46.180 --> 03:08:47.672
how much further we're going.

03:08:47.672 --> 03:08:51.936
So if we trap this and make it the Alamo, we do that,

03:08:51.936 --> 03:08:53.546
but we also haven't seen what's beyond this.

03:08:53.546 --> 03:08:56.776
We could make it pretty damaging along the way,

03:08:56.776 --> 03:08:58.026
and if they do have to stop and heal,

03:08:58.026 --> 03:08:59.702
that's not necessarily a bad thing.

03:08:59.702 --> 03:09:00.535
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:09:00.535 --> 03:09:02.096
LIAM: Speaking out of character,

03:09:02.096 --> 03:09:03.746
this is a secret entrance, though.

03:09:04.656 --> 03:09:05.566
They don't know about this.

03:09:05.566 --> 03:09:06.636
TALIESIN: They do.
LAURA: No, they do,

03:09:06.636 --> 03:09:07.869
they're the ones that told us about it.

03:09:07.869 --> 03:09:08.702
MARISHA: This is their entrance.

03:09:08.702 --> 03:09:09.716
LIAM: This is their entrance?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:09:09.716 --> 03:09:11.931
MATT: Yes, they've traversed here once before with Vess.

03:09:11.931 --> 03:09:13.666
TALIESIN: So they know what to expect.

03:09:13.666 --> 03:09:14.499
LIAM: So they're definitely--

03:09:14.499 --> 03:09:16.336
MATT: You gather they know what to expect.

03:09:18.506 --> 03:09:20.864
TRAVIS: I would put it at the top

03:09:20.864 --> 03:09:22.822
and let gravity work for us,

03:09:22.822 --> 03:09:25.496
because it's one of the only places that it will.

03:09:25.496 --> 03:09:27.886
And then if we decide to make it the Alamo, we can,

03:09:27.886 --> 03:09:29.256
if we go in further and then nothing is attractive--

03:09:29.256 --> 03:09:30.186
MARISHA: And want to backtrack.

03:09:30.186 --> 03:09:32.356
TRAVIS: We can sit, or we can keep going,

03:09:32.356 --> 03:09:34.006
and make it one of a few.

03:09:34.006 --> 03:09:35.386
But either way, if they are hurt here,

03:09:35.386 --> 03:09:37.656
and they decide to stop, we could come to this,

03:09:37.656 --> 03:09:39.466
because the intuit charge will let us know,

03:09:39.466 --> 03:09:41.146
or we'll hear it, right?

03:09:41.146 --> 03:09:44.106
LAURA: My only thing is that if the intuit charge goes off,

03:09:44.106 --> 03:09:47.236
and it's at the top of the thing,

03:09:47.236 --> 03:09:50.086
then they'll know that we're here laying a trap for them.

03:09:50.086 --> 03:09:54.256
So they'll be on the lookout for an ambush later.

03:09:54.256 --> 03:09:56.726
And we can't set up in this room,

03:09:56.726 --> 03:09:58.316
because we'll get fucked up

03:09:58.316 --> 03:10:00.306
in the process of just trying to.

03:10:00.306 --> 03:10:01.509
TRAVIS: 300 feet, yeah.

03:10:02.736 --> 03:10:04.436
LIAM: What if you reverse the order,

03:10:04.436 --> 03:10:08.916
or what if you do the glyph?

03:10:08.916 --> 03:10:11.256
Because they're probably going to take that rope down.

03:10:11.256 --> 03:10:12.406
Glyph goes off, they fall,

03:10:12.406 --> 03:10:15.229
land in a circle of intuit charges.

03:10:18.486 --> 03:10:20.516
And then, from there, they're going to move

03:10:20.516 --> 03:10:22.636
into this metal passage.

03:10:22.636 --> 03:10:24.596
And if we-- probably should scope it out,

03:10:24.596 --> 03:10:26.216
but we could wait further into the passage,

03:10:26.216 --> 03:10:28.616
ready to hit that little opening

03:10:28.616 --> 03:10:30.826
that they'd be coming through once they're in.

03:10:30.826 --> 03:10:33.676
TRAVIS: Yeah, as long as the intuits stack,

03:10:33.676 --> 03:10:34.992
which they should.

03:10:36.119 --> 03:10:38.276
The other part is if one of the glyphs goes off,

03:10:38.276 --> 03:10:39.666
and they're coming down in single file,

03:10:39.666 --> 03:10:41.960
the first person will trigger it, not the other ones.

03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:43.384
LAURA: It's a 60-foot radius.

03:10:43.384 --> 03:10:46.055
So yeah, if they're going down one at a time,

03:10:46.055 --> 03:10:47.423
then it's not going to--

03:10:47.423 --> 03:10:49.806
TRAVIS: They'll get one.
LIAM: Put the glyph

03:10:49.806 --> 03:10:52.506
70 feet or 80 feet down,

03:10:52.506 --> 03:10:55.916
so that they're coming down the rope when it triggers,

03:10:55.916 --> 03:10:57.116
that's when it triggers.

03:10:58.286 --> 03:11:00.136
Don't put it at the top, put it halfway down,

03:11:00.136 --> 03:11:02.176
so they're doing this, (explosion),

03:11:02.176 --> 03:11:05.774
fall into intuit charges, (explosion).

03:11:05.774 --> 03:11:07.486
LAURA: What if they come down one at a time on the rope,

03:11:07.486 --> 03:11:08.815
and only one person gets hit?

03:11:08.815 --> 03:11:10.166
TRAVIS: That's what I mean, it's just that bottom person.

03:11:10.166 --> 03:11:13.086
At least if that intuit is at the bottom, when it triggers,

03:11:13.086 --> 03:11:15.746
the first person at 60 feet, it's 300 feet up,

03:11:15.746 --> 03:11:17.496
so it'll catch everybody in that tube,

03:11:17.496 --> 03:11:20.186
and they'll all either save or fall.

03:11:20.186 --> 03:11:23.806
And then whoever falls goes by the glyph, (foomphing)

03:11:23.806 --> 03:11:24.806
they catch it.

03:11:24.806 --> 03:11:26.966
We could set some more intuits on the bottom, but gravity.

03:11:26.966 --> 03:11:29.866
SAM: The intuit charge, what triggers it?

03:11:29.866 --> 03:11:31.746
MARISHA and LIAM: Proximity.
TRAVIS: First person within 60 feet.

03:11:31.746 --> 03:11:32.656
SAM: Only proximity?

03:11:32.656 --> 03:11:34.409
LIAM: No, there's two ways it goes off.

03:11:35.836 --> 03:11:39.485
SAM: I think one is you trigger it.

03:11:39.485 --> 03:11:40.759
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Psychically.

03:11:41.626 --> 03:11:42.459
SAM: Yeah.

03:11:43.356 --> 03:11:46.766
LIAM: But it's-- "You link your mind to the device,

03:11:46.766 --> 03:11:49.356
"and anytime within the next hour,

03:11:49.356 --> 03:11:52.036
"you may choose to detonate," so that's very limited.

03:11:52.036 --> 03:11:54.196
TALIESIN: I'll also remind, I should remind everybody

03:11:54.196 --> 03:11:58.816
that this won't work on the big bad at all.

03:11:58.816 --> 03:12:00.399
MARISHA: No, but if we can pick away

03:12:00.399 --> 03:12:01.792
the rest of the Tomb Takers.
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

03:12:01.792 --> 03:12:02.748
TRAVIS: That's all we're talking about.

03:12:02.748 --> 03:12:04.161
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:12:04.161 --> 03:12:05.156
TALIESIN: And we're assuming none of them--

03:12:05.156 --> 03:12:08.236
LAURA: I mean, the glyph could potentially work on Lucien.

03:12:08.236 --> 03:12:09.106
TALIESIN: No.

03:12:09.106 --> 03:12:11.966
LAURA: It doesn't necessarily just do mind damage;

03:12:11.966 --> 03:12:14.466
it can do regular-ass damage.

03:12:14.466 --> 03:12:15.496
TALIESIN: Does it?

03:12:15.496 --> 03:12:16.956
LAURA: Yeah.

03:12:16.956 --> 03:12:18.686
TRAVIS: What else does it do?

03:12:18.686 --> 03:12:22.426
LAURA: I think, unless, is he-- let's see.

03:12:22.426 --> 03:12:24.446
LIAM: This is it, we're just standing in the chamber.

03:12:24.446 --> 03:12:25.956
LAURA: I know, we should probably move.

03:12:25.956 --> 03:12:26.797
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:12:26.797 --> 03:12:29.339
LAURA: Get out of here before we finish this talk.

03:12:34.215 --> 03:12:36.485
MARISHA: Being on Jester, am I near the rope still?

03:12:36.485 --> 03:12:37.993
The dangling rope, Matt?
TRAVIS: We have four into it?

03:12:37.993 --> 03:12:39.405
Four, five?

03:12:39.405 --> 03:12:41.115
LIAM: He didn't answer that question.

03:12:41.115 --> 03:12:42.938
MATT: No, you guys would've climbed across the other one.

03:12:42.938 --> 03:12:44.305
The dangling rope is in the middle of the chamber,

03:12:44.305 --> 03:12:46.050
which is where Essek is.

03:12:46.050 --> 03:12:47.745
You're with Jester, with the rest of the group,

03:12:47.745 --> 03:12:48.975
which is off on the far

03:12:48.975 --> 03:12:51.225
western side of the chamber, yeah.

03:12:51.225 --> 03:12:53.425
Which, Essek heard you say about cold.

03:12:53.425 --> 03:12:54.475
Did you mention that?

03:12:54.475 --> 03:12:56.678
TALIESIN: Yes, I did. Out loud.

03:12:56.678 --> 03:12:57.511
MATT: Essek goes--

03:12:59.795 --> 03:13:04.045
Thankfully, one of the cantrips he has is Ray of Frost.

03:13:04.045 --> 03:13:05.495
TALIESIN: Oh, well.
MATT: And he goes--

03:13:07.253 --> 03:13:09.445
(whooshing) And you watch as he extends his finger,

03:13:09.445 --> 03:13:11.225
like a laser beam of bright blue.

03:13:11.225 --> 03:13:12.975
Just carves across.

03:13:12.975 --> 03:13:14.745
As it does, you watch as the mold

03:13:14.745 --> 03:13:17.505
grays and turns to dust where the blade hits.

03:13:17.505 --> 03:13:19.487
TALIESIN: Well, that's one way to do it, I suppose.

03:13:19.487 --> 03:13:20.788
MARISHA: Don't kill all of it.

03:13:20.788 --> 03:13:22.745
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just make our path

03:13:22.745 --> 03:13:25.005
and just keep something for them to play with.

03:13:25.005 --> 03:13:26.205
MATT: "I'm intending to carve a path."

03:13:26.205 --> 03:13:27.535
TRAVIS: Well, the thing about the intuit charge,

03:13:27.535 --> 03:13:29.215
it's about the size of your palm,

03:13:29.215 --> 03:13:30.205
but if you lay it on the ground

03:13:30.205 --> 03:13:32.225
it's going to float up in the air about three feet.

03:13:32.225 --> 03:13:33.735
It's obvious.

03:13:33.735 --> 03:13:35.985
If you lay it at least underneath the roof of the cavern,

03:13:35.985 --> 03:13:37.985
it'll (bloops) look a balloon on the ceiling.

03:13:37.985 --> 03:13:40.565
So it's a good spot for it.

03:13:40.565 --> 03:13:43.875
SAM: It'll still reach everybody all the way up to the top.

03:13:43.875 --> 03:13:47.145
MARISHA: I think we do that. I like that plan.

03:13:47.145 --> 03:13:50.435
And then we can always at least set them,

03:13:50.435 --> 03:13:52.965
keep moving forward, to Fjord's point.

03:13:52.965 --> 03:13:55.276
And we can always backtrack if we need to.

03:13:55.276 --> 03:13:56.109
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:13:59.255 --> 03:14:02.125
SAM: Will we at least go look through this door

03:14:02.125 --> 03:14:03.145
to see what's on the other side

03:14:03.145 --> 03:14:05.045
before we start setting these charges?

03:14:05.045 --> 03:14:06.555
LIAM: Because this is our waiting spot.

03:14:06.555 --> 03:14:08.595
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can fly for--
MARISHA: Maybe.

03:14:08.595 --> 03:14:09.828
SAM: And we could--
MARISHA: Maybe.

03:14:09.828 --> 03:14:12.378
SAM: -- with Essek's Ray of Frost--
TRAVIS: She can fly, you can fly.

03:14:12.378 --> 03:14:14.995
SAM: With Essek's Ray of Frost, we could fight them in here.

03:14:14.995 --> 03:14:17.535
If we had an area that was all frosty and not moldy--

03:14:17.535 --> 03:14:18.368
MARISHA: In a way.

03:14:19.485 --> 03:14:20.825
SAM: That could be our little bunker.

03:14:20.825 --> 03:14:21.955
LIAM: Yeah, they've been here,

03:14:21.955 --> 03:14:24.005
so they're not afraid of this mold, either.

03:14:24.005 --> 03:14:26.085
They can either take it or they found a way past it.

03:14:26.085 --> 03:14:28.615
TRAVIS: And one of the big things we need is distance

03:14:28.615 --> 03:14:30.695
for the anti-magic cone, distance.

03:14:30.695 --> 03:14:31.745
TALIESIN: Lots and lots of distance.

03:14:31.745 --> 03:14:33.208
TRAVIS: What's the rough?

03:14:34.625 --> 03:14:36.445
MATT: The rough width?

03:14:36.445 --> 03:14:40.635
All the way across would be about 80 or so feet.

03:14:40.635 --> 03:14:41.468
80 to 90 feet.

03:14:41.468 --> 03:14:42.855
TRAVIS: Oh, it's not as big as I thought.

03:14:42.855 --> 03:14:44.705
MARISHA: And how big is that black light that we have?

03:14:44.705 --> 03:14:46.713
The magic black light, that poofs--

03:14:46.713 --> 03:14:47.870
LIAM: And who has them?
MARISHA: -- into the area?

03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:49.036
TALIESIN: I don't remember who has them.

03:14:49.036 --> 03:14:50.715
What are they called?

03:14:50.715 --> 03:14:51.956
MARISHA: I thought you had them, Caduceus,

03:14:51.956 --> 03:14:53.635
but I could be wrong.
TRAVIS: I'm guessing Allura.

03:14:53.635 --> 03:14:55.488
LIAM: Yeah, they were two grenards.

03:14:55.488 --> 03:14:56.745
SAM: We have--
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:14:56.745 --> 03:14:58.645
MATT: The arcane field generator, I think.

03:15:00.615 --> 03:15:02.698
SAM: The AFG.

03:15:02.698 --> 03:15:04.948
(laughter)

03:15:06.875 --> 03:15:08.572
TRAVIS: I was robbed of my bag of holding.

03:15:08.572 --> 03:15:10.101
So I don't have it.

03:15:10.101 --> 03:15:11.148
MARISHA: Who gave us those?

03:15:11.148 --> 03:15:12.165
TALIESIN: I don't see it in my--

03:15:12.165 --> 03:15:14.715
SAM: You guys still got that ring of fire protection there?

03:15:14.715 --> 03:15:16.265
TRAVIS: No, I don't.

03:15:16.265 --> 03:15:17.739
LAURA: I have it.

03:15:17.739 --> 03:15:19.525
LIAM: Unattuned.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:15:19.525 --> 03:15:22.175
SAM: It's just a nice ring.
MARISHA: It's real pretty.

03:15:22.175 --> 03:15:24.675
LIAM: It's cold here.
TRAVIS: I like to spoil my--

03:15:24.675 --> 03:15:26.705
TALIESIN: One of us took it, but I didn't write it into my--

03:15:26.705 --> 03:15:29.445
LIAM: I didn't write it down either, but we have them, so--

03:15:29.445 --> 03:15:30.345
MARISHA: We do have them.

03:15:32.675 --> 03:15:35.575
SAM: All right, let's go explore the next thing and--

03:15:35.575 --> 03:15:36.935
TALIESIN: In case this has to spill over,

03:15:36.935 --> 03:15:39.195
we should see what else is around.

03:15:39.195 --> 03:15:40.335
We know what we're dealing with.

03:15:40.335 --> 03:15:41.873
Let's find out a little bit more about

03:15:41.873 --> 03:15:44.218
what we're dealing with and where they're really going.

03:15:45.155 --> 03:15:46.185
MATT: "So my question is,

03:15:46.185 --> 03:15:48.447
"do you need me to carve a path for people?"

03:15:48.447 --> 03:15:50.355
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I think we better carve a path.

03:15:50.355 --> 03:15:52.195
MATT: "All right."
TALIESIN: We'll follow you.

03:15:52.195 --> 03:15:54.375
MATT: From where he's standing, he steps a little bit over

03:15:54.375 --> 03:15:55.737
to the direction where all of you are standing

03:15:55.737 --> 03:16:00.075
and just burns about a 20 or so foot wide walkway.

03:16:01.495 --> 03:16:03.765
Carving it straight through to where you guys are,

03:16:03.765 --> 03:16:05.465
glides over as he does so.

03:16:07.115 --> 03:16:08.425
"Follow me."

03:16:08.425 --> 03:16:12.375
Turns around and just slowly burns it through.

03:16:12.375 --> 03:16:14.915
You watch as the mold pulls away.

03:16:14.915 --> 03:16:16.965
The edges of it, graying and turning into

03:16:16.965 --> 03:16:19.345
this piled silt.

03:16:19.345 --> 03:16:21.758
You move forward across the rubble,

03:16:21.758 --> 03:16:23.916
pulling and climbing over where the sections of it are.

03:16:23.916 --> 03:16:26.975
Eventually, you come to see, with your light,

03:16:26.975 --> 03:16:31.725
the partially damaged, still holding, metallic archway

03:16:31.725 --> 03:16:33.235
into the next hall.

03:16:33.235 --> 03:16:36.455
SAM: Thank you, Frozone, that was awesome.

03:16:36.455 --> 03:16:38.845
LIAM: The spider peels off of the rock wall

03:16:38.845 --> 03:16:40.545
onto the now-grayed mold

03:16:40.545 --> 03:16:42.985
and Caleb is standing in human form.

03:16:42.985 --> 03:16:43.818
MATT: All right.

03:16:45.223 --> 03:16:46.056
LAURA: (whooshing)

03:16:48.075 --> 03:16:49.185
MATT: So what's the marching order here?

03:16:49.185 --> 03:16:50.115
LAURA: Sorry.

03:16:50.115 --> 03:16:52.045
Oh, but no, you can still hold on for a piggy,

03:16:52.045 --> 03:16:52.934
if you want a piggyback ride?

03:16:52.934 --> 03:16:53.767
MARISHA: Okay.

03:16:54.745 --> 03:16:58.665
LAURA: The one thing that I see on the Symbol spell

03:16:58.665 --> 03:17:03.168
that could damage Lucien potentially, is pain.

03:17:05.315 --> 03:17:08.005
So it's not like necrotic damage.

03:17:08.005 --> 03:17:10.735
It's not fire damage. It's just pain damage.

03:17:10.735 --> 03:17:14.055
And it would just make them, whoever gets it,

03:17:14.055 --> 03:17:16.537
would be incapacitated for a minute.

03:17:16.537 --> 03:17:17.986
SAM: That's pretty good.
LAURA: In just, pain.

03:17:17.986 --> 03:17:19.063
MARISHA: I mean, that's amazing.

03:17:19.063 --> 03:17:21.211
TRAVIS: Does it deal any hit points or just incapacitate?

03:17:21.211 --> 03:17:22.588
LAURA: It's just incapacitated on them.

03:17:22.588 --> 03:17:24.930
LIAM: Just side steps his resistances.
TRAVIS: That doesn't count as a

03:17:24.930 --> 03:17:26.579
charm or a hold or a?

03:17:26.579 --> 03:17:27.805
LAURA: I don't think so because it's--

03:17:27.805 --> 03:17:29.240
TRAVIS: A category that we would know from?

03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:33.132
LAURA: It's not a charm. It's not a wisdom save or anything.

03:17:33.132 --> 03:17:35.065
It's a constitution save and it--

03:17:36.205 --> 03:17:38.495
SAM: It's just pain.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:38.495 --> 03:17:40.025
TRAVIS: For a minute?
LAURA: For a minute.

03:17:40.025 --> 03:17:41.635
TALIESIN: It's a brain freeze.

03:17:41.635 --> 03:17:43.795
SAM: That's pretty cool.
ASHLEY: It is pretty cool.

03:17:43.795 --> 03:17:47.515
SAM: A minute of attacking without an anti-magic field

03:17:47.515 --> 03:17:49.804
is pretty good.
LAURA: That'd be nice.

03:17:49.804 --> 03:17:51.941
TRAVIS: And they can fall.
TALIESIN: A minute of falling down.

03:17:51.941 --> 03:17:52.774
MARISHA: I mean,

03:17:52.774 --> 03:17:54.752
that's the ambush one, right?
SAM: That's the dream.

03:17:54.752 --> 03:17:57.325
LAURA: That's the one we can't set this in a place

03:17:57.325 --> 03:17:59.425
where we're not going to be able to attack them immediately

03:17:59.425 --> 03:18:01.025
because it's absolutely worthless

03:18:01.025 --> 03:18:02.525
for them to bicker amongst themselves

03:18:02.525 --> 03:18:05.115
or be in pain for a minute if we can't do anything with it.

03:18:05.115 --> 03:18:06.215
LIAM: So be right in front of us.

03:18:06.215 --> 03:18:07.715
LAURA: Yes.

03:18:07.715 --> 03:18:09.890
This is where we hide. This is where we do your doorway.

03:18:09.890 --> 03:18:12.705
This is where we do, you know?

03:18:12.705 --> 03:18:16.115
LIAM: How far is it from this metal archway,

03:18:16.115 --> 03:18:18.825
crushed metal archway, to where the rope lands

03:18:18.825 --> 03:18:20.075
in the chamber?

03:18:20.075 --> 03:18:20.925
MATT: It's roughly--

03:18:24.745 --> 03:18:25.678
Actually, a bit more than 80 feet,

03:18:25.678 --> 03:18:26.795
it'd be close to like--

03:18:30.905 --> 03:18:33.985
Close to 90 to a 100 feet across from edge to edge.

03:18:33.985 --> 03:18:36.715
From where the rope is, it's about 70 feet.

03:18:36.715 --> 03:18:38.105
LIAM: I can start dealing damage

03:18:38.105 --> 03:18:41.595
to the bottom of that rope from this door.

03:18:41.595 --> 03:18:43.695
SAM: Cool.
MARISHA: From the door.

03:18:43.695 --> 03:18:46.995
You know, when we first encountered Gelidon

03:18:46.995 --> 03:18:48.875
that really good tactic that we had,

03:18:48.875 --> 03:18:50.814
when you were definitely here.
LIAM: When we were all together,

03:18:50.814 --> 03:18:51.920
sure.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:18:51.920 --> 03:18:53.325
LIAM: I was probably the most present.

03:18:53.325 --> 03:18:55.745
You guys, your mind was like--

03:18:55.745 --> 03:19:00.525
MARISHA: Yes, we were very distracted with a white dragon.

03:19:00.525 --> 03:19:02.355
LIAM: Saved your asses.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:19:02.355 --> 03:19:04.980
With your dome. Because you stayed in the dome

03:19:04.980 --> 03:19:06.905
and pew, pew, pew from--

03:19:06.905 --> 03:19:09.415
LIAM: Those domes, the trick of them,
you got to get them up.

03:19:09.415 --> 03:19:10.735
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:19:10.735 --> 03:19:12.855
But if we're ambushing,

03:19:12.855 --> 03:19:16.825
could we have a dome in this corridor to where?

03:19:16.825 --> 03:19:17.899
LIAM: We sure as hell could.

03:19:17.899 --> 03:19:19.426
MARISHA: They can't (bonk).

03:19:19.426 --> 03:19:20.756
LAURA: Can't they just dispel--
TALIESIN: They can.

03:19:20.756 --> 03:19:21.589
They can dispel it instantly.

03:19:21.589 --> 03:19:23.484
LAURA: They can just dispel it immediately.

03:19:23.484 --> 03:19:24.923
TALIESIN: If they have Detect Magic up,

03:19:24.923 --> 03:19:26.255
it'll be a big shining beacon.

03:19:26.255 --> 03:19:27.345
LIAM: Hold on.

03:19:27.345 --> 03:19:31.873
MARISHA: Well, if they're popped by a giant pain trap--

03:19:31.873 --> 03:19:33.195
LAURA: Oh well, yeah.
MARISHA: Then.

03:19:33.195 --> 03:19:35.875
TALIESIN: Well, then we don't need
the dome in the first place.

03:19:35.875 --> 03:19:38.425
MARISHA: As long as we can kill them in a minute, I guess.

03:19:41.495 --> 03:19:42.615
LIAM: They could.

03:19:42.615 --> 03:19:44.035
There's a long range on Dispel.

03:19:44.035 --> 03:19:46.225
TRAVIS: This doesn't have to be
the room where we pick the fight--

03:19:46.225 --> 03:19:48.515
TALIESIN: I want to see more, yeah.
TRAVIS: There could be a bigger space.

03:19:48.515 --> 03:19:49.765
We either just set it here

03:19:49.765 --> 03:19:51.535
and know that it's meant to take out some of them

03:19:51.535 --> 03:19:54.938
and not be the final, or we can come back.

03:19:56.265 --> 03:19:57.975
LAURA: I just don't know if it's bad to let them know

03:19:57.975 --> 03:20:01.815
ahead of time that we're already in here.

03:20:01.815 --> 03:20:03.155
If they're on their guard,

03:20:03.155 --> 03:20:04.955
then there'll be looking for traps.

03:20:04.955 --> 03:20:08.127
They might spot whatever we set for them.

03:20:08.127 --> 03:20:09.695
TRAVIS: We can come back then.

03:20:10.745 --> 03:20:12.145
TALIESIN: Let's keep going, I think.

03:20:13.975 --> 03:20:16.085
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel you.
LIAM: This is--

03:20:16.085 --> 03:20:17.918
Let's keep going. This is pretty good.

03:20:17.918 --> 03:20:18.807
TALIESIN: It is.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:20:18.807 --> 03:20:20.655
SAM: Great.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:20:20.655 --> 03:20:22.605
TALIESIN: I'd like to know--
MARISHA: I also don't want to get

03:20:23.585 --> 03:20:25.665
too far ahead and then miss our opportunity,

03:20:25.665 --> 03:20:27.495
and they're here, if they're on our asses.

03:20:27.495 --> 03:20:29.945
I don't know. I wish we knew where the fuck they were.

03:20:29.945 --> 03:20:32.012
SAM: We know that they're not upstairs yet

03:20:32.012 --> 03:20:33.705
because we would've gotten a radio call.

03:20:33.705 --> 03:20:35.714
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: That's true.

03:20:35.714 --> 03:20:38.345
TRAVIS: Yeah, worst case scenario, we get the radio call,

03:20:38.345 --> 03:20:40.635
you two, you haul ass,

03:20:40.635 --> 03:20:44.495
you fly, you set, book it out.

03:20:44.495 --> 03:20:45.877
LAURA: Yeah, it takes a minute to set--

03:20:45.877 --> 03:20:47.720
TALIESIN: We have to know what we're running into.

03:20:47.720 --> 03:20:48.645
TRAVIS: But we should keep going, then,

03:20:48.645 --> 03:20:49.635
if we're not going to do it now.

03:20:49.635 --> 03:20:52.415
LIAM: Matt, I asked earlier, but you got distracted.

03:20:52.415 --> 03:20:55.185
The sack that we got from the Tomb Takers,

03:20:55.185 --> 03:20:57.575
did it have two or three?

03:20:57.575 --> 03:20:59.145
MATT: I can't find my notes at the moment.

03:20:59.145 --> 03:21:02.075
I'll go ahead and double check the episode

03:21:02.075 --> 03:21:03.348
but we can do that.

03:21:04.575 --> 03:21:06.258
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Say two for now.

03:21:06.258 --> 03:21:07.408
ASHLEY: Two.
LIAM: Two.

03:21:07.408 --> 03:21:08.242
MATT: I feel like it was two

03:21:08.242 --> 03:21:09.995
because you had one and made it--

03:21:09.995 --> 03:21:11.633
ASHLEY: Arcane field generator two--

03:21:11.633 --> 03:21:13.145
SAM: Oh, arcane field generator.

03:21:13.145 --> 03:21:16.615
ASHLEY: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
MATT: Yeah, two arcane field generators.

03:21:16.615 --> 03:21:18.465
ASHLEY: Chest of goodies that I didn't write down

03:21:18.465 --> 03:21:20.688
because I was distracted by sword.

03:21:20.688 --> 03:21:22.135
MATT: Could be two, could be three.

03:21:22.135 --> 03:21:23.595
I'll double check.

03:21:23.595 --> 03:21:25.835
LIAM: I think it is two, but--

03:21:25.835 --> 03:21:26.804
SAM: Someone text Dani.

03:21:26.804 --> 03:21:27.854
ASHLEY: God, I feel like I would've--

03:21:29.905 --> 03:21:31.396
MATT: So are you moving on?

03:21:31.396 --> 03:21:32.692
SAM: Let's go into the next room.

03:21:32.692 --> 03:21:34.255
"Marching order," he said.

03:21:34.255 --> 03:21:35.963
MATT: Yes, now this entrance way

03:21:35.963 --> 03:21:38.055
can offer two people at a time, shoulder to shoulder.

03:21:38.055 --> 03:21:41.005
TRAVIS: Ray of Frost, somebody that can see.

03:21:41.005 --> 03:21:41.838
Essek and--

03:21:41.838 --> 03:21:44.255
LIAM: The Ray of Frost, is the mold traveling

03:21:44.255 --> 03:21:47.252
past cavern into metal corridor or?

03:21:47.252 --> 03:21:48.295
MATT: It is a little bit, yeah.
LIAM: A little bit.

03:21:48.295 --> 03:21:50.405
MATT: Where you can see.
LIAM: Okay.

03:21:50.405 --> 03:21:52.518
LAURA: I'll go after Essek.

03:21:53.758 --> 03:21:56.415
MATT: All right, so Essek will make his way to the front.

03:21:56.415 --> 03:21:58.195
Who else? Is anyone going to be aside Essek?

03:21:58.195 --> 03:21:59.511
Or is Essek just going to be

03:21:59.511 --> 03:22:01.765
holding the line?
LIAM: How about some muscle for

03:22:01.765 --> 03:22:02.598
our friend?

03:22:02.598 --> 03:22:04.315
TRAVIS: I'll go with Essek and I'll have the sword out

03:22:04.315 --> 03:22:05.595
so there's light at the front.

03:22:05.595 --> 03:22:07.015
MATT: All right, you got it.

03:22:07.015 --> 03:22:07.848
Who's after them?

03:22:07.848 --> 03:22:09.905
LAURA: These muscles right here.
TRAVIS: Jester's behind with--

03:22:09.905 --> 03:22:10.765
MATT: Right.

03:22:10.765 --> 03:22:12.835
LIAM: I'll walk by Jester.

03:22:12.835 --> 03:22:13.668
MATT: All right.

03:22:13.668 --> 03:22:16.605
ASHLEY: I'll go back there, behind them.

03:22:16.605 --> 03:22:17.438
LAURA: Show him these guns.

03:22:17.438 --> 03:22:19.135
LIAM: You have more muscles than him.

03:22:19.135 --> 03:22:21.425
I was talking about you.
SAM: Me and Beau in the rear.

03:22:21.425 --> 03:22:23.405
You want your goggles back?

03:22:23.405 --> 03:22:24.958
MARISHA: Are you still using them or you good?

03:22:24.958 --> 03:22:26.085
SAM: I don't know.

03:22:26.085 --> 03:22:27.625
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take them back.

03:22:27.625 --> 03:22:29.145
SAM: Maybe we can share like headphones.

03:22:29.145 --> 03:22:31.470
MARISHA: Oh yeah, okay. Yeah.

03:22:31.470 --> 03:22:32.695
This is a good podcast.

03:22:33.555 --> 03:22:35.640
TRAVIS: The sword gives off 40 feet, not 30, so 40.

03:22:35.640 --> 03:22:36.473
So you guys can--

03:22:36.473 --> 03:22:37.975
MATT: Good to know.

03:22:37.975 --> 03:22:40.195
As you were approaching the archway now,

03:22:40.195 --> 03:22:42.425
you can see where the metal is bent down

03:22:44.395 --> 03:22:47.405
and you three, notice immediately,

03:22:47.405 --> 03:22:49.285
as the light from the sword hits it,

03:22:49.285 --> 03:22:53.465
there is chiseled text into the metal.

03:22:53.465 --> 03:22:54.796
LIAM: Can we read it?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:22:54.796 --> 03:22:56.605
TRAVIS: Can you read it?
MATT: You cannot read it.

03:22:56.605 --> 03:22:59.085
LIAM: I instantly cast Comprehend Language.

03:22:59.085 --> 03:23:01.075
MATT: All right.
LAURA: You can read it. (laughs)

03:23:01.075 --> 03:23:02.175
MATT: Now you can read it.

03:23:03.325 --> 03:23:04.158
SAM: All dick jokes.

03:23:04.158 --> 03:23:09.158
MATT: It reads, "Praesidis Ward, Convocation Grounds,

03:23:09.535 --> 03:23:11.552
Central Deliberations."

03:23:11.552 --> 03:23:13.677
MARISHA: Praesidis.
LIAM: Ward.

03:23:13.677 --> 03:23:14.865
Ward.

03:23:14.865 --> 03:23:15.938
Praesidis Ward.

03:23:17.575 --> 03:23:18.745
One more time, all the way through?

03:23:18.745 --> 03:23:23.208
MATT: Convocation Grounds, Central Deliberations.

03:23:28.455 --> 03:23:29.535
LAURA: Central Deliberations?

03:23:29.535 --> 03:23:30.635
Doesn't that sound like it would be

03:23:30.635 --> 03:23:32.051
like a courtroom or something?

03:23:32.051 --> 03:23:34.255
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: It does.

03:23:34.255 --> 03:23:38.558
SAM: Or some-- yeah.

03:23:39.442 --> 03:23:41.708
Aren't they, like, philosophers?

03:23:42.775 --> 03:23:45.395
LIAM: Well, the Somnovem in the Cognouza Ward were,

03:23:45.395 --> 03:23:47.965
but we are in the Praesidis Ward.

03:23:47.965 --> 03:23:49.549
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: All right, okay.

03:23:51.505 --> 03:23:53.145
SAM: Like for proceedings.

03:23:53.145 --> 03:23:54.478
TALIESIN: Let's go, lore kids.

03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:56.973
Where's our lore kids?

03:23:56.973 --> 03:23:59.125
LAURA: (laughs)

03:23:59.125 --> 03:24:01.205
MATT: Essek continues to clear the path ahead,

03:24:01.205 --> 03:24:06.195
burning away the bits of brown mold that block your path.

03:24:06.195 --> 03:24:08.795
You push past the metallic archway

03:24:08.795 --> 03:24:10.785
and lead into the proceeding hall.

03:24:10.785 --> 03:24:12.575
LAURA: Can I just-- I'm sorry.

03:24:12.575 --> 03:24:13.408
MATT: Yeah.

03:24:13.408 --> 03:24:15.585
LAURA: Can I just do a perception check?

03:24:15.585 --> 03:24:19.095
Is it obvious that a path was burned away in this mold

03:24:19.095 --> 03:24:19.995
or is it?
MARISHA: I know,

03:24:19.995 --> 03:24:21.830
LAURA: Like, I don't--

03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:22.755
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah, It's going to look like we're

03:24:22.755 --> 03:24:23.967
riding a lawnmower.

03:24:23.967 --> 03:24:25.895
LAURA: So they're going to know
that somebody came through here?

03:24:25.895 --> 03:24:27.128
TALIESIN: Does anybody have a a little fire

03:24:27.128 --> 03:24:27.961
that they could throw?

03:24:27.961 --> 03:24:31.675
MATT: It certainly looks tampered with. I mean, yeah.

03:24:31.675 --> 03:24:34.845
LAURA: Can I use-- I don't know if it is any heat, though.

03:24:34.845 --> 03:24:36.645
I was going to try Sacred Flame, but that's actually--

03:24:36.645 --> 03:24:38.095
TALIESIN: No.
LAURA: That's radiant.

03:24:38.095 --> 03:24:39.975
What about you? Yeah.

03:24:39.975 --> 03:24:42.125
Yeah, maybe bring some fire to bring it back

03:24:42.125 --> 03:24:43.915
to regrow the path.

03:24:43.915 --> 03:24:45.405
MARISHA: We can also cross that bridge

03:24:45.405 --> 03:24:46.795
if we decide to not put the intuit charge--

03:24:46.795 --> 03:24:47.921
LAURA: That's true, that's true, that's true.

03:24:47.921 --> 03:24:49.109
Because we have a little time.

03:24:49.109 --> 03:24:50.445
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:24:50.445 --> 03:24:52.485
LIAM: Easy to test when we want to.

03:24:52.485 --> 03:24:54.005
We've already spoiled the ground,

03:24:54.005 --> 03:24:57.405
so there's no issue with futzing with it further.

03:24:57.405 --> 03:24:58.238
LAURA: Okay.

03:25:00.588 --> 03:25:02.005
SAM: Okay, so we're in the hallway?

03:25:02.005 --> 03:25:03.165
TRAVIS: We're moving.
LAURA: Sorry,

03:25:03.165 --> 03:25:04.405
you were saying something and I cut you off.

03:25:04.405 --> 03:25:05.835
MATT: Oh, it's okay.

03:25:05.835 --> 03:25:09.175
Entering inside, the same diamonds and dusting of frost

03:25:09.175 --> 03:25:11.245
clings to every surface within this tunnel.

03:25:11.245 --> 03:25:15.845
And not unlike where the previous Aeorian ruins

03:25:15.845 --> 03:25:18.425
you'd come to, this metallic hallway does remind you

03:25:18.425 --> 03:25:21.515
in some ways of the structure near the laboratory,

03:25:21.515 --> 03:25:23.568
where you had encountered the giant baby.

03:25:24.445 --> 03:25:26.475
The materials and the architectural design of it

03:25:26.475 --> 03:25:27.765
seem similar.

03:25:27.765 --> 03:25:29.195
And in the same way, panels have fallen

03:25:29.195 --> 03:25:32.755
and there are other cables and bits

03:25:32.755 --> 03:25:35.515
of metallic, load-bearing rods that have punctured through.

03:25:35.515 --> 03:25:39.555
It's like stepping through this once-beautiful

03:25:39.555 --> 03:25:43.872
and pristine, smooth interior.

03:25:43.872 --> 03:25:45.825
And now it's just jagged and ruined,

03:25:45.825 --> 03:25:49.645
but little pockets of its glory as it once was.

03:25:49.645 --> 03:25:54.645
You can almost visualize various studious individuals

03:25:54.925 --> 03:25:56.745
in similar robes to the one that you found

03:25:56.745 --> 03:26:01.105
and varying types of fashion exaggerations beyond that,

03:26:01.105 --> 03:26:03.065
walking up and down these halls,

03:26:03.065 --> 03:26:05.128
debating, arguing, discussing.

03:26:07.135 --> 03:26:10.388
Likely nose in the air, as far as you're concerned, Yasha.

03:26:12.645 --> 03:26:13.855
Pushing forward,

03:26:18.138 --> 03:26:21.775
the tunnel begins to come to a T-intersection.

03:26:21.775 --> 03:26:24.405
It drifts into this intersection left and right

03:26:24.405 --> 03:26:26.195
and continuing forward.

03:26:26.195 --> 03:26:27.675
You can see where elements of the floor

03:26:27.675 --> 03:26:30.195
have broken in a bit and began to fall.

03:26:30.195 --> 03:26:32.675
There's a large piece of metallic beam

03:26:32.675 --> 03:26:34.418
that has crossed over in the way.

03:26:35.694 --> 03:26:39.185
But you can see four paths to traverse.

03:26:39.185 --> 03:26:41.635
TRAVIS: Straight ahead, left and right?

03:26:41.635 --> 03:26:44.875
MARISHA: Can I do a quick investigation check

03:26:44.875 --> 03:26:46.941
to see if there's

03:26:46.941 --> 03:26:50.605
any path that looks like the main walkway?

03:26:50.605 --> 03:26:55.468
Or if one seems more derelict and collapsed?

03:26:56.315 --> 03:26:57.915
LIAM: I'll look, too, for the writing.

03:26:59.662 --> 03:27:00.495
MATT: You what? I'm sorry.

03:27:00.495 --> 03:27:02.675
LIAM: For further writing, text.

03:27:02.675 --> 03:27:04.378
MATT: Okay, so perception check.

03:27:05.723 --> 03:27:07.605
Would likely to be a perception check

03:27:07.605 --> 03:27:09.388
for you to kind of make it out.

03:27:11.135 --> 03:27:12.022
Go for it.

03:27:13.325 --> 03:27:14.815
MARISHA: 18 total.

03:27:14.815 --> 03:27:16.215
MATT: Okay.

03:27:16.215 --> 03:27:18.220
A quick glance.

03:27:18.220 --> 03:27:19.775
I mean, most of this is derelict.

03:27:19.775 --> 03:27:21.475
It all fell to the same degree.

03:27:21.475 --> 03:27:23.618
Are you looking for tracks or anything?

03:27:25.655 --> 03:27:26.945
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:27:26.945 --> 03:27:28.035
Just flow.

03:27:28.035 --> 03:27:30.715
What would feel like, in it's heyday,

03:27:30.715 --> 03:27:33.035
what would be the main corridor?

03:27:33.035 --> 03:27:34.135
MATT: Likely for a design like this,

03:27:34.135 --> 03:27:39.095
it would continue downward in a straight position.

03:27:39.095 --> 03:27:41.995
But there is a slight adjusted kink of the hallway.

03:27:42.878 --> 03:27:44.175
Where it splits in the T-intersection,

03:27:44.175 --> 03:27:46.638
it offsets a little bit. It's a unique design.

03:27:48.525 --> 03:27:50.091
Pardon me.

03:27:50.091 --> 03:27:53.548
TALIESIN: Yasha, you said you found
that robe on a body, right?

03:27:55.005 --> 03:27:58.532
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was on a skeleton that was--

03:27:58.532 --> 03:28:00.655
TALIESIN: Skeleton got buried, right?

03:28:00.655 --> 03:28:04.567
ASHLEY: It was half covered with--

03:28:04.567 --> 03:28:06.220
it was in a collapsed building.

03:28:06.220 --> 03:28:08.995
TALIESIN: But the building is super collapsed now.

03:28:08.995 --> 03:28:10.825
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: If you find another body,

03:28:10.825 --> 03:28:13.765
keep the skull, if you wouldn't mind.

03:28:13.765 --> 03:28:15.255
ASHLEY: You got it.
TALIESIN: Thanks.

03:28:15.255 --> 03:28:17.528
I got an idea.

03:28:20.035 --> 03:28:21.638
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:28:24.025 --> 03:28:25.545
We need a tour guide.

03:28:25.545 --> 03:28:28.165
LAURA: What if this was--

03:28:28.165 --> 03:28:31.973
What if there's multiple entrances from the

03:28:33.989 --> 03:28:36.556
tunnel, right?

03:28:36.556 --> 03:28:38.845
And this is the one that leads to the Praesidis Ward,

03:28:38.845 --> 03:28:40.695
but there's another doorway that we didn't see

03:28:40.695 --> 03:28:44.575
that leads to the Somnovem Ward. Wouldn't that'd be funny?

03:28:46.205 --> 03:28:48.185
ASHLEY: Like if it was that dangling door?

03:28:48.185 --> 03:28:49.704
Like there was--

03:28:49.704 --> 03:28:51.105
It went to somewhere secret?

03:28:51.105 --> 03:28:53.305
MARISHA: Did we see any other doors in that main--

03:28:53.305 --> 03:28:54.945
in the molded chamber?

03:28:54.945 --> 03:28:58.245
MATT: No. It looked like an exterior courtyard.

03:28:58.245 --> 03:29:00.905
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Now mostly buried.

03:29:00.905 --> 03:29:01.845
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: An exterior--

03:29:01.845 --> 03:29:03.005
TALIESIN: I think we're on the right path.

03:29:03.005 --> 03:29:04.619
LIAM: Super weird.

03:29:04.619 --> 03:29:07.195
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: 21 for words.

03:29:07.195 --> 03:29:08.565
MATT: Looking around the inside of this chamber,

03:29:08.565 --> 03:29:11.840
you've maybe traveled a couple hundred feet

03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:14.456
you've maybe traveled a couple hundred feet

03:29:14.456 --> 03:29:17.885
into this hallway before coming to this intersection.

03:29:17.885 --> 03:29:21.215
And you do not see any viable texts or anything

03:29:21.215 --> 03:29:22.385
that catches your eye.

03:29:22.385 --> 03:29:25.525
LIAM: And everything is lit by Fjord's sword alone?

03:29:25.525 --> 03:29:26.515
MATT: Fjord's sword, yeah.

03:29:26.515 --> 03:29:27.585
LIAM: That's spooky.
TALIESIN: Can you ask

03:29:27.585 --> 03:29:28.995
the Traveler maybe, or?

03:29:28.995 --> 03:29:30.108
LAURA: I know, that's what I was thinking.

03:29:30.108 --> 03:29:32.689
I could spend a few minutes and ask the Traveler.

03:29:32.689 --> 03:29:35.435
TALIESIN: Let's take 10 minutes and we can do that.

03:29:35.435 --> 03:29:36.375
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

03:29:36.375 --> 03:29:37.655
I'll just sit down on the ground

03:29:37.655 --> 03:29:40.148
and try to contact Arty.

03:29:41.255 --> 03:29:42.865
LIAM: They're right on top of us, man.

03:29:42.865 --> 03:29:44.625
LAURA: If you guys don't mind, can we wait for 10 minutes?

03:29:44.625 --> 03:29:48.328
I can just ask Arty to go take a look?

03:29:49.873 --> 03:29:51.355
TRAVIS: You're asking him to take a look where?

03:29:51.355 --> 03:29:52.188
LAURA: In the courtyard,

03:29:52.188 --> 03:29:53.021
if there was another entrance

03:29:53.021 --> 03:29:55.354
we missed or anything.
TALIESIN: I was thinking which way to go.

03:29:55.354 --> 03:29:56.365
LAURA: Or if he knew which way to go.

03:29:56.365 --> 03:29:57.775
TALIESIN: Well, you got three questions, so.

03:29:57.775 --> 03:29:58.608
LAURA: Yeah.

03:29:58.608 --> 03:30:00.155
MARISHA: And maybe if you have an extra question,

03:30:00.155 --> 03:30:03.585
you can see if Lucien and co. are close-ish?

03:30:03.585 --> 03:30:04.702
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can see.

03:30:04.702 --> 03:30:05.826
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: I can try. Okay.

03:30:05.826 --> 03:30:07.331
LIAM: That's excellent

03:30:07.331 --> 03:30:10.485
because if we delay 20 or 30 minutes,

03:30:10.485 --> 03:30:13.255
I can take a short rest and regain a little bit of my--

03:30:13.255 --> 03:30:14.895
LAURA: We need an hour for a short rest.

03:30:14.895 --> 03:30:16.567
LIAM: Boo-urns.

03:30:17.555 --> 03:30:19.115
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's not short rest

03:30:19.115 --> 03:30:20.473
'til we absolutely need to at this point--

03:30:20.473 --> 03:30:21.575
LAURA: We literally just took one today.

03:30:21.575 --> 03:30:23.425
TRAVIS: Sure, 10 minutes.
LAURA: All right.

03:30:23.425 --> 03:30:27.855
I'll sit down and set up a little Commune ritual.

03:30:27.855 --> 03:30:28.688
MATT: All righty.

03:30:29.705 --> 03:30:32.044
What's everyone else doing during the 10-minute period?

03:30:32.044 --> 03:30:33.778
ASHLEY: I'm keeping my sword out.

03:30:34.635 --> 03:30:37.985
TALIESIN: I am keeping a very sharp eye on everything.

03:30:37.985 --> 03:30:40.015
MARISHA: I'm going to chat with Fjord.

03:30:40.015 --> 03:30:42.015
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: But we'll get to that.

03:30:42.015 --> 03:30:43.333
MATT: Well, it takes you 10 minutes to do it.

03:30:43.333 --> 03:30:45.178
So in that 10 minute period, what do you say?

03:30:46.935 --> 03:30:50.388
MARISHA: I think you're right about
the intuit charge back there.

03:30:51.415 --> 03:30:54.208
Just the more I think about it, the more that seems right.

03:30:55.915 --> 03:30:59.445
I'm thinking about the dozens of ways

03:30:59.445 --> 03:31:01.925
that we could blow our cover to Lucien

03:31:01.925 --> 03:31:04.325
before he even steps in that chamber.

03:31:04.325 --> 03:31:05.515
First and foremost being,

03:31:05.515 --> 03:31:07.398
if any of those rangers get spotted.

03:31:09.845 --> 03:31:12.965
I don't know, I'm just afraid the further down we go,

03:31:12.965 --> 03:31:15.678
the more we will blow our cover that we are here.

03:31:16.685 --> 03:31:21.235
TRAVIS: And just spatially, it's a gift.

03:31:21.235 --> 03:31:23.478
Line of sight, gravity.

03:31:24.795 --> 03:31:28.435
I don't know what would compare, but--

03:31:29.395 --> 03:31:30.795
MARISHA: I'm sure there's many cons

03:31:30.795 --> 03:31:32.465
that we're not thinking about, but--

03:31:32.465 --> 03:31:36.685
TRAVIS: Also, we might only get
half of them or less or none,

03:31:36.685 --> 03:31:40.848
but at least our chances are compounded by what's there.

03:31:42.217 --> 03:31:43.305
That's how I see it.

03:31:43.305 --> 03:31:48.063
But whether we do damage and they heal

03:31:48.063 --> 03:31:50.471
or whatever.

03:31:51.895 --> 03:31:56.175
Off their guard, even for a moment and then unsettled,

03:31:56.175 --> 03:31:57.595
I'm happy with.

03:31:57.595 --> 03:31:59.815
They were very confident the last time we met.

03:31:59.815 --> 03:32:00.648
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:02.035 --> 03:32:03.795
Having some sort of rip cord, though,

03:32:03.795 --> 03:32:06.725
if things start getting really bad, like last time.

03:32:06.725 --> 03:32:08.675
It's the only thing that I can't--

03:32:10.085 --> 03:32:13.765
That I'm trying to think of now with this situation.

03:32:13.765 --> 03:32:15.165
TRAVIS: What do you mean, rip cord?

03:32:16.725 --> 03:32:19.235
MARISHA: A "get out of Dodge" for us,

03:32:19.235 --> 03:32:21.958
if they do start overtaking us and it all backfires.

03:32:23.535 --> 03:32:25.508
TRAVIS: Where does that go in your mind?

03:32:26.835 --> 03:32:29.221
We leave and what?

03:32:30.665 --> 03:32:31.823
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:32:35.535 --> 03:32:38.438
TRAVIS: I don't think we're leaving.

03:32:43.825 --> 03:32:45.508
MARISHA: I guess it's a question of,

03:32:46.350 --> 03:32:48.283
if Lucien starts chasing us,

03:32:48.283 --> 03:32:50.495
or if we start chasing Lucien.

03:32:55.795 --> 03:32:57.305
TRAVIS: Sure.
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:32:57.305 --> 03:33:01.215
It's good to continue discovering

03:33:01.215 --> 03:33:04.355
all the paths ahead of us so we have options.

03:33:04.355 --> 03:33:06.525
TRAVIS: We've definitely had the tables turned on us before,

03:33:06.525 --> 03:33:09.194
but for the moment, we're at least between him and

03:33:09.194 --> 03:33:11.182
what he wants.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:33:11.182 --> 03:33:14.125
TRAVIS: But we are going to win this thing.

03:33:14.125 --> 03:33:16.725
We're going to fight until the last second

03:33:16.725 --> 03:33:18.825
and we're going to win.

03:33:18.825 --> 03:33:22.788
There is no leaving, maybe for some, but not for me.

03:33:23.745 --> 03:33:25.045
And I don't think for you.

03:33:27.238 --> 03:33:29.288
MARISHA: (sighs) Just thinking about the others.

03:33:30.388 --> 03:33:32.298
TRAVIS: I know. They look to you.

03:33:40.265 --> 03:33:41.815
MARISHA: Let's not disappoint.

03:33:43.035 --> 03:33:43.868
TRAVIS: We won't.

03:33:44.995 --> 03:33:45.828
MARISHA: Okay.

03:33:48.625 --> 03:33:50.005
MATT: You're doing your ritual where?

03:33:50.005 --> 03:33:52.095
Like, in the middle of the hall?

03:33:52.095 --> 03:33:55.085
LAURA: Yeah, like up against the wall.

03:33:55.085 --> 03:33:57.615
I'll have a little half circle of all my little trinkets

03:33:57.615 --> 03:34:00.735
for the Traveler and my crystals that I've gathered.

03:34:00.735 --> 03:34:02.522
You know, make it look pretty.

03:34:02.522 --> 03:34:03.645
MATT: Okay.

03:34:03.645 --> 03:34:04.928
What's everyone else doing?

03:34:06.045 --> 03:34:07.745
TALIESIN: Keeping an eye, guarding.

03:34:07.745 --> 03:34:11.435
Looking down both, trying to keep an eye down both tunnels.

03:34:11.435 --> 03:34:13.935
Trying to keep an eye on, just keeping,

03:34:13.935 --> 03:34:15.295
somebody's got to keep a watch.

03:34:15.295 --> 03:34:16.795
MATT: Okay.

03:34:16.795 --> 03:34:18.565
ASHLEY: Yeah, just watching.

03:34:18.565 --> 03:34:20.881
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Trying on the robe.

03:34:20.881 --> 03:34:22.073
MATT: So make a perception check.

03:34:22.073 --> 03:34:24.005
Are you glancing down the two tunnels to look?

03:34:24.005 --> 03:34:25.935
TALIESIN: Yeah, I mean we're there, right?

03:34:25.935 --> 03:34:28.185
MATT: You guys are right up at the intersection.

03:34:28.185 --> 03:34:29.595
You haven't traversed it at all.

03:34:29.595 --> 03:34:30.625
TALIESIN: No, just taking a look.

03:34:30.625 --> 03:34:31.765
MATT: No ones actually even looked down

03:34:31.765 --> 03:34:33.098
one hallway or the other.

03:34:33.098 --> 03:34:35.868
SAM: We haven't looked down the hall?

03:34:35.868 --> 03:34:36.851
We should look down the hall.

03:34:36.851 --> 03:34:39.275
MATT: Just the one ahead.
SAM: Just look with your eyes.

03:34:39.275 --> 03:34:41.385
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm 12.

03:34:41.385 --> 03:34:42.315
MATT: 12?

03:34:42.315 --> 03:34:43.815
TALIESIN: I rolled really badly.

03:34:43.815 --> 03:34:45.865
MATT: Yeah, you did.

03:34:45.865 --> 03:34:47.255
TALIESIN: Wow.
MATT: Glancing ahead

03:34:47.255 --> 03:34:48.835
with what little bit of light you have,

03:34:48.835 --> 03:34:53.435
once again the glittering ice dust across the floor

03:34:53.435 --> 03:34:54.735
catches your attention.

03:34:54.735 --> 03:34:57.085
Weirdly beautiful in its desolation down here.

03:34:58.125 --> 03:34:59.935
You can't see much on either side of the hall.

03:34:59.935 --> 03:35:01.895
You do see similar signs of collapse,

03:35:01.895 --> 03:35:05.935
but you cannot see where they go beyond a few feet

03:35:05.935 --> 03:35:07.668
due to the lack of light source.

03:35:07.668 --> 03:35:08.501
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:35:09.615 --> 03:35:12.225
MATT: You turn around and see Jester working on her ritual

03:35:12.225 --> 03:35:13.835
and they're having the conversation.

03:35:13.835 --> 03:35:14.885
TALIESIN: Back up a bit, then.

03:35:17.335 --> 03:35:20.915
MATT: Your passive perception, though, does pick up

03:35:22.147 --> 03:35:24.730
this shape,

03:35:26.795 --> 03:35:28.415
along the ceiling.

03:35:29.515 --> 03:35:32.025
One of the open collapsed holes

03:35:32.025 --> 03:35:34.315
and broken parts of this metallic hallway,

03:35:34.315 --> 03:35:37.665
you see something reach out

03:35:37.665 --> 03:35:38.881
and clamber--
TALIESIN: I'm backing up.

03:35:38.881 --> 03:35:41.755
MATT: -- along the ceiling.
TALIESIN: We got a problem.

03:35:42.685 --> 03:35:44.415
I'm going to hide behind the door.

03:35:44.415 --> 03:35:47.455
We've got a problem, get ready.

03:35:47.455 --> 03:35:49.925
TRAVIS: How long has it been into Jester's ritual?

03:35:49.925 --> 03:35:51.825
MATT: It's been maybe six, seven minutes or so.

03:35:51.825 --> 03:35:54.315
TRAVIS: I shake her out of it.
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

03:35:54.315 --> 03:35:57.098
MATT: As you go to shake her out of it.

03:35:58.105 --> 03:35:59.658
You go behind, there's no door.

03:35:59.658 --> 03:36:02.235
TALIESIN: I mean, so I'm assuming that--

03:36:02.235 --> 03:36:04.002
MATT: So this is behind.

03:36:04.002 --> 03:36:06.560
You've gone up to-- there's the intersection, right?

03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:09.045
You're all here at the base of it.

03:36:09.045 --> 03:36:10.105
She's doing the ritual.

03:36:10.105 --> 03:36:11.775
You walk up and look both ways, turn back,

03:36:11.775 --> 03:36:13.649
and there's something emerging on the opposite side.

03:36:13.649 --> 03:36:15.650
LAURA: Oh, like from the courtyard side?

03:36:15.650 --> 03:36:17.137
MATT: From the courtyard side, from the ceiling.

03:36:17.137 --> 03:36:18.895
LIAM: From behind where we came.
MATT: It's funny you mentioned Aliens earlier.

03:36:18.895 --> 03:36:22.368
It climbs out slowly. And it's large.

03:36:25.159 --> 03:36:27.655
And it's at this moment-- (loud thudding)

03:36:27.655 --> 03:36:30.475
You all hear the heavy metallic impact of something.

03:36:30.475 --> 03:36:33.485
Multiple limbs, clanging onto the metallic ground

03:36:33.485 --> 03:36:36.245
and you hear (guttural breathing).

03:36:36.245 --> 03:36:37.675
SAM: Clanging?

03:36:37.675 --> 03:36:39.085
MATT: Well, hanging and then

03:36:39.085 --> 03:36:40.965
landing onto the ground.
TALIESIN: Oh hell.

03:36:40.965 --> 03:36:43.603
MATT: Glancing back in turn, you see--

03:36:43.603 --> 03:36:48.603
you see a rather massive,

03:36:48.735 --> 03:36:52.665
lizard-like creature of deep blue cerulean skin.

03:36:52.665 --> 03:36:54.915
Elements of frost crystals gathered

03:36:54.915 --> 03:36:58.745
at the edges of its limbs and folds of its body.

03:36:58.745 --> 03:37:01.253
Multiple legs,

03:37:01.253 --> 03:37:04.212
as its eyes glance towards you

03:37:04.212 --> 03:37:05.915
and the light flickers past it

03:37:05.915 --> 03:37:08.855
like a creature in a flashlight in the shadows.

03:37:08.855 --> 03:37:12.485
As it opens its mouth, you see drool drip out

03:37:12.485 --> 03:37:17.325
and immediately freeze onto the metal beneath.

03:37:17.325 --> 03:37:18.325
And as it exhales,

03:37:18.325 --> 03:37:23.316
the air gives off a cloud of frost.

03:37:24.585 --> 03:37:25.418
And that's where we'll pick up next week.

03:37:25.418 --> 03:37:28.528
TRAVIS: Oh no!
MARISHA: I knew it!

03:37:28.528 --> 03:37:31.193
ASHLEY: Let's just play more.
SAM: No!

03:37:31.193 --> 03:37:32.993
MARISHA: (groaning)

03:37:32.993 --> 03:37:34.302
I don't want to--
ASHLEY: I hate it.

03:37:34.302 --> 03:37:37.795
MARISHA: Can we just leave it for them?

03:37:37.795 --> 03:37:39.995
SAM: Can we control it? Who can control monsters?

03:37:39.995 --> 03:37:40.865
MATT: So here's the thing.

03:37:40.865 --> 03:37:44.228
Whoever goes first, fights the things.

03:37:45.625 --> 03:37:46.626
SAM: Yeah, whoever--

03:37:46.626 --> 03:37:48.415
MATT: (laughs)

03:37:48.415 --> 03:37:50.305
TALIESIN: I mean, we have options.
TRAVIS: Fights the thing<i>s</i>?

03:37:50.305 --> 03:37:52.221
ASHLEY: Fights whatever's down--

03:37:52.221 --> 03:37:53.587
MATT: Anything in the ruins

03:37:53.587 --> 03:37:56.575
that've taken up residence in the path that you're going.

03:37:56.575 --> 03:37:59.155
ASHLEY: Whoever's behind us is going to have an easy time.

03:37:59.155 --> 03:38:02.325
SAM: Unless we can somehow charm this creature

03:38:02.325 --> 03:38:04.823
and tell it to hang out by the glyph.

03:38:04.823 --> 03:38:05.998
MATT: If you got the magic for it.

03:38:07.486 --> 03:38:09.723
TALIESIN: Turn it into a ferret.

03:38:09.723 --> 03:38:10.756
MARISHA: It's kind of cool.

03:38:10.756 --> 03:38:12.195
It's a cool idea.

03:38:12.195 --> 03:38:13.195
ASHLEY: What's a cool idea?

03:38:13.195 --> 03:38:14.245
MARISHA: Charming it.

03:38:14.245 --> 03:38:15.985
Making it our buddy.
ASHLEY: Make it a pal?

03:38:15.985 --> 03:38:17.845
MARISHA: Yeah, make it a pal.
TRAVIS: It doesn't last that long.

03:38:17.845 --> 03:38:19.774
LIAM: Yeah, it's like a minute.

03:38:19.774 --> 03:38:21.925
LAURA: You can't charm monsters the same way.

03:38:21.925 --> 03:38:23.648
ASHLEY: Okay, we can't talk about this in front of Matt.

03:38:23.648 --> 03:38:24.914
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh! It's an hour!

03:38:24.914 --> 03:38:26.638
MATT: Nope, you got to think.

03:38:26.638 --> 03:38:28.585
LAURA: So that was a 5th-level spell

03:38:28.585 --> 03:38:29.714
because I was already in the middle.

03:38:29.714 --> 03:38:30.547
Oh, no, it's a ritual!

03:38:30.547 --> 03:38:32.205
LIAM: They could show up.
MATT: It's a ritual.

03:38:32.205 --> 03:38:33.364
LAURA: So it doesn't waste a spell slot.

03:38:33.364 --> 03:38:35.435
MATT: You did not waste a spell slot.

03:38:35.435 --> 03:38:37.435
ASHLEY: I don't want to stop playing!

03:38:37.435 --> 03:38:38.695
MATT: I know, but if we go from here

03:38:38.695 --> 03:38:40.376
it could end up going pretty late.
ASHLEY: I know, I know.

03:38:40.376 --> 03:38:41.415
TALIESIN: You don't get to leave.

03:38:41.415 --> 03:38:42.248
MATT: We'll pick up for that next time.

03:38:42.248 --> 03:38:44.200
LIAM: But on on the flip side, we get to [inaudible].

03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:45.835
MATT: That's true. That's true.

03:38:45.835 --> 03:38:46.935
All right.
MARISHA: ♪ Time to fire up ♪

03:38:46.935 --> 03:38:49.545
♪ the text thread. ♪

03:38:49.545 --> 03:38:50.645
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah!
MATT: Indeed.

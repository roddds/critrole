00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.233
MATT: Hello everybody,

00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.810
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.460
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.747
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:08.201
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.240
MATT: That one, all of that.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.520
Before we get into tonight's episode,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.350
we do have a few announcements to get through,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.110
beginning with the first of our two sponsors,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.583
NordVPN. Sam.

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.278
SAM: Ctrl-alt-good day, fellow netheads.

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:26.261
It's me, BlackWillow69@aol.com!

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:29.300
LAURA: And Cryptonic Override.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.580
It's been a few gigaflops

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.379
since we've had to hash out our hacker haptics

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.610
because the worldwide web has been totally safe.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.740
SAM: Yeah! It's thanks to NordVPN,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.010
providers of the highest quality encryption

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.420
for your internet traffic that hides your IP

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970
and physical location.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.120
Go to nordvpn.com/criticalrole

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.075
and use code CRITICALROLE

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:48.440
at checkout to get a two-year plan

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.070
plus one additional month with a 70% discount.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.841
But yeah, like Cryptonic Override said,

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.820
the Ultra Kodex has gone into cyber hibernation.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.940
And the threat level is once again

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.030
midnight.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.010
LAURA: So today, we're going to do something fun,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.280
and take the cast on a VR tour of hackerspace

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.890
courtesy of our friends at NordVPN.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.650
SAM: Is everybody ready to jack yourselves live on camera?

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.950
MARISHA: Wait, what?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.670
MATT: Sure.
ASHLEY: Sounds super fun.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.503
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:18.330
SAM: Okay, let's do it!

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.360
Getting ready to supernova the Wonderwall.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630
LAURA: Connecting Miami to the sound machine.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.500
SAM: Running Harry protocol on the Hendersons.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.241
And... we're...

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:29.549
in the main frame!

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.053
ALL: Whoa.

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:33.169
MATT: This is incredible.
MARISHA: Okay, this is kind of cool.

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:35.681
LIAM: So many angry Matt Key videos.

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:37.570
Where in the internet are we?

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.090
MARISHA: Oh, this must be Brittany Walloch's Vimeo.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.137
This is dope.

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:42.250
ASHLEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.510
Now we're somewhere else.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.640
Whoa. What is this strange writing, hieroglyphics?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.090
TALIESIN: It's Aramaic. It must be my MySpace account.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.340
Wow, it's really old.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.260
TRAVIS: Ooh, well, let me see if I can hack into

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.880
Brian Foster's porn collection.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.393
Wait. What's that bright light?

00:01:58.393 --> 00:02:00.682
SAM: Uh-oh. Wait, wait, wait, Travis.

00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:01.808
Watch out, Travis!

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:04.430
TRAVIS: (screaming)

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.520
LAURA: What's wrong?

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.730
SAM: Oh no!

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.330
Travis has been techno-blepped

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.440
by a high-tension, 64-bit nanovirus!

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.389
MARISHA: What? In English, Riegel! Is he dead?

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.840
SAM: No, no, no. He's just frozen.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.870
He can be rebooted, but only by

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.438
(keyboard typing)
(gasps)

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.170
the Ultra Kodex.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.060
It's back.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.710
Everyone quick. Jack off.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.921
Everyone jack off right now!

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.417
LIAM: Excuse me?
LAURA: He means to unplug.

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:28.408
SAM: Unplug, unplug, unplug.

00:02:28.408 --> 00:02:29.250
MATT: Okay. All right.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.733
SAM: (sighing)

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.200
LAURA: That was a closed loop, NordVPN-guarded internet.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.510
There's no way the Ultra Kodex could have infiltrated it.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.576
SAM: Unless the Ultra Kodex is...

00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:39.303
here in this room?!

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:40.840
TALIESIN: That's impossible.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.770
SAM: Is it?

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.103
Quick, what do we know about the Ultra Kodex?

00:02:44.103 --> 00:02:45.830
What clues do we have?

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.880
LAURA: Well, it's super powerful.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.320
It worked with the Serial Killer.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.430
MARISHA: And it called Matt

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.940
that really weird specific nickname, remember?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.773
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.960
You latex dork, remember that?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.660
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
SAM: Wait a second.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.450
You latex dork.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.450
Let me key that phrase

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.473
into our NordVPN manual override de-scrambler.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.880
Oh my god.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.950
If you de-scramble it, it says,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.500
Ultra Kodex.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.560
That means that--
(gasping)

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.668
Matt, you are the Ultra Kodex!

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:20.840
MATT: (evil laughter)

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.333
So you finally discovered my secret.

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:25.925
But it's too late!

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.110
I fragged Travis' body,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.295
and won't de-frag it until my demands are met.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.440
TRAVIS: (giggles)

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.273
SAM: Why is he laughing, then?

00:03:34.273 --> 00:03:35.650
(laughter)

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.260
You monster!

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.220
(laughter)

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.888
Keep it still, Travis.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.150
You monster!

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.600
What are your demands?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.899
MATT: I'll tell you...

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:48.840
the next time NordVPN sponsors this show.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.714
SAM: Oh, damn it!

00:03:50.714 --> 00:03:52.360
Well, I guess we'll have to wait.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.270
Protect yourselves from cyber attacks

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.080
and avoid bandwidth issues with NordVPN.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.860
And Matt, as much as I hate to say it:

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.823
Hack to you.

00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:04.750
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.464
LIAM: Intrigue.

00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:07.464
SAM: You guys can see--

00:04:07.464 --> 00:04:09.122
ASHLEY: Travis is still frozen.

00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:10.171
SAM: Oh no.
ASHLEY: Travis!

00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:11.837
MATT: It's over.
LAURA: Travis, you're fine.

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:13.453
MATT: Travis, you can--
LAURA: You're fine.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.475
MATT: Okay, there we go.

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:17.369
TRAVIS: My face hurts. I got a cramp on the right side.

00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:19.313
SAM: Nothing in the Nordiverse--

00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:21.820
Once the ad is over,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.870
like, we reset.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.053
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:24.053 --> 00:04:25.452
ASHLEY: Time stops.
SAM: Yeah.

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:26.352
ASHLEY: This part isn't real.

00:04:26.352 --> 00:04:27.810
TRAVIS: Restarting the computer, I got it.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.276
MATT: Exactly.

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:31.326
Thank you, Sam.
LAURA: Don't watch me undress, camera.

00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:33.493
(laughter)

00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:35.746
MATT: Look at me. Look at me. Look over here!

00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:37.638
Look at me! All right.

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:41.310
Thank you, NordVPN.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.400
Our second sponsor for the night is Skillshare.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.840

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.700
That's right.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.533
Very easy.

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:30.616
TRAVIS: What?

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:35.342

SAM: 0211?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.493
MATT: 01211, Sam!

00:05:45.493 --> 00:05:48.210
SAM: It's not like 2021, like the year or something?

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.710
MATT: That's what it says on the paper!

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.009
SAM: Why would they do that?!

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.676
I love them. Please sponsor our show.

00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:55.088
LIAM: Is this the first spot bleeding into the second spot?

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.274
MATT: I know, right?

00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:57.518
(laughter)
MARISHA: That's what it feels like!

00:05:57.518 --> 00:06:00.907
MATT: skl.sh/criticalrole01211

00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:03.330
(laughter)

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.807
You'll get a free premium membership.

00:06:07.807 --> 00:06:10.540
So go check out Skillshare for yourself now.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.493
And thank you so much for our friends at Skillshare

00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:14.920
for sponsoring this show.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.036
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:06:16.036 --> 00:06:18.228
TRAVIS: Couldn't have remembered that.
MATT: Ah--!

00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:19.930
LAURA: There should be graphic at the bottom saying

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.749
the actual.
MATT: Yeah, follow the graphic.

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:22.830
Follow the graphic.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.085
If I'm wrong, follow the graphic.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:26.673
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) "That's what it says on the paper!"

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:30.160
(laughter)

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.690
MATT: Also, starting tonight,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.807
we are broadcrasting-- broadcrasting.

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:35.551
We're broadcrasting Critical Role

00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:39.006
live on both Twitch and YouTube channels.

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:40.493
But still the best place

00:06:40.493 --> 00:06:42.208
to participate in the live experience

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:46.030
is with our community at the Twitch channel itself.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.322
As per usual, tonight's VOD will be available right away

00:06:48.322 --> 00:06:49.222
on our Twitch channel.

00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:50.310
And this episode will be uploaded

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.765
to YouTube as VOD on Monday at noon Pacific.

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:53.850
So no changes there at all.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.320
Everything's good to go.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.440
Laura, you had some announcements.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.781
LAURA: Eyy!

00:06:57.781 --> 00:07:01.781
We are excited to announce our partnership with

00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:04.260
WizKids, which does

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.946
high-quality miniatures from our very own Exandria

00:07:07.946 --> 00:07:09.840
that you can place within your own world,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.240
that you're creating or exploring.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.073
Our first--

00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:13.906
Oh gosh, wow.

00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:17.390
Six box sets of premium printed, painted--

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.223
Nope.

00:07:18.223 --> 00:07:23.223
Premium painted figures will be available this spring

00:07:23.547 --> 00:07:27.547
at local game stores across the world, you guys.

00:07:29.067 --> 00:07:31.520
But for a peek at the miniatures included

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.260
in our first offerings with WizKids,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.080
check out our announcement on our website

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.654
at critrole.com.

00:07:38.654 --> 00:07:40.821
SAM: I think you mean critrole.com/

00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:44.288
LAURA: 112.
SAM: ~1-7.

00:07:44.288 --> 00:07:46.203
(laughter)

00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:47.476
Russian E.

00:07:47.476 --> 00:07:50.451
(laughter)
TRAVIS: "Russian E."

00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:53.027
MATT: I'm super excited.

00:07:53.027 --> 00:07:53.860
LIAM: Miniatures!

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.480
LAURA: Yeah, it's going to be awesome.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.341
MATT: As you know, I'm a fiend for miniatures

00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:01.031
for, well, going on, like, 15 years.

00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:02.339
So--
LAURA: That doesn't--

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:03.530
That doesn't track, Matt.
MATT: Come across at all?

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.471
LAURA: No, it doesn't.
MATT: I'm sorry.

00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:07.004
Well, for those who didn't know, I like minis.

00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:08.910
And I'm super excited for you guys to check these out.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.810
It's been awesome.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.420
All right. I think that's it and that's all.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.436
So without further ado,

00:08:15.436 --> 00:08:19.200
let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.258
Critical Role.

00:08:20.258 --> 00:08:22.644
(dramatic shouting)

00:08:22.644 --> 00:08:24.244
(water bubbling)

00:08:24.244 --> 00:08:28.661
(thunder rumbling)

MATT: Welcome back.

00:09:59.219 --> 00:10:00.900
(laughter)

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.603
So, last we left off:

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.960
The Mighty Nein have been making their way

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.210
across Eiselcross, the frozen north.
CAST: ♪ Making my way ♪

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.140
MATT: Trying to outdo the Tomb Takers in the retrieval

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.420
of the threshold crests that they are carrying

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.600
towards the ruins of Aeor

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.170
for some sort of nefarious purpose,

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.716
you assume deals with the Cognouza.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.970
So after convening with them against your will,

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.320
you've been traveling with them

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.746
in an odd,

00:10:35.746 --> 00:10:38.480
tense social environment.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.550
You traversed the lava river that cuts

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.400
through Eiselcross magically.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.379
And before the second to last day of travel came to an end,

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:50.562
And before the second to last day of travel came to an end,

00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:52.766
you made some conversation.

00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:56.290
You made an offer to perhaps read and help Lucien

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.660
with some of the book that he is apparently

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.053
unable to completely unravel.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.580
You went and plotted a bit within your tower,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.540
discussing different possibilities

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.623
of turning events into your favor.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.880
Lucien, however did knock at the door

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.480
wondering what you were all doing

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.960
in this strange, extra-dimensional space.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.140
After a brief bit of miscommunication

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.420
and a door slammed in his face,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.500
he canceled the tower.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.070
And left you all out in the frozen snow

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.147
for another night of not as comfortable rest.

00:11:27.147 --> 00:11:28.514
SAM: Betch.

00:11:28.514 --> 00:11:31.230
MATT: As you all took a moment to adjust

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.423
to your unfortunate fortune,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.210
Jester decided to go ahead and offer a tarot card reading.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.380
Lucien, intrigued, sat and accepted.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.203
And after an oddly poignant series of pulls,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.100
it had a series of unexpected effects on Lucien

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.963
before he, mildly unnerved, stood up and walked away.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.170
So,

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.910
as you all now adjust to the coming freezing night here

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.060
in the frozen tundras of the north,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.260
you watch as Lucien returns to the campfire,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.597
not but 30, 40 feet from where you stand.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.005
What would you like to do?

00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:15.480
LAURA: (nervous noise)

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.199
LIAM: How do we do this again?
LAURA: I guess--

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:19.529
SAM: Why? We just did this last week.

00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:21.242
LIAM: [inaudible]

00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:22.483
LAURA: I guess we need the--

00:12:22.483 --> 00:12:23.540
MATT: It's the evening.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.763
LAURA: -- the dome then.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.561
LIAM: Yeah.
(sighing)

00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:29.360
(sucking teeth) Okay.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.840
Right where we have the

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.823
far more plush tower, I suppose.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.003
Are we good to have a little bit of space?

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.481
MATT: "A bit of space, sure."

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.620
LIAM: Okay.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.793
Slap the book down on my lap and begin to do the thing.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.300
Take me about 10 minutes.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:52.521
MATT: All right.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.170
As you guys are all puttering around and building a bit,

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.360
you can see the fire that they've situated on the side

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.680
and they've heated up some sort of liquid

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.283
and begun finishing up their meals.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.232
Lucien looks back over your space and goes,

00:13:09.232 --> 00:13:11.040
"Now don't be pouty.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.380
"You're welcome to come and sit by the fire.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.323
"Share a drink."

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.610
SAM: Sure. I've never turned down a drink before.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.017
TRAVIS: I'll join.

00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:22.850
ASHLEY: I'll join.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.683
TALIESIN: I'll watch.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.753
MARISHA: All right.
MATT: All right.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.614
All right. So who all's going to the fire?

00:13:30.614 --> 00:13:32.361
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh)

00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:33.194
ASHLEY: I'll go.

00:13:33.194 --> 00:13:34.677
LAURA: No, I'm cold.
SAM: To the fire? Yeah.

00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:37.119
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: I stand next to Caduceus.

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:42.060
TRAVIS and LAURA: [inaudible]

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.893
MATT: Okay.

00:13:42.893 --> 00:13:44.092
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: That's it.

00:13:44.092 --> 00:13:46.710
LAURA: Yeah, I'll go over.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.803
SAM: What's your drink of choice?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.440
MATT: "Well," looks over towards Zoran,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.800
who you can see has this

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.950
leather-wrapped cask of some kind

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.800
that he keeps shouldered to the side.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.200
"We're a bit low on the interior heating provisions,

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.600
"but we've a bit enough of the strong stuff

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.230
"to keep spilling about."

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.748
He goes ahead and take some and pours it

00:14:11.748 --> 00:14:16.170
into this, what looks like a metal

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.250
kind of a heavy cauldron, if you will.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.760
Like a small portable cauldron.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.550
And begins to add these,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.830
spices and elements.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.300
It's less of a drink

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.250
and it's more of a mildly alcoholic stew,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.830
if that makes any sense.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.003
LAURA: That sounds really gross.

00:14:35.003 --> 00:14:36.600
TRAVIS: Mulled wine with protein.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.930
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: I'm kind of here for it.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.820
LAURA: Is there, like, beef in there?
LIAM: I want it.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.987
LAURA: Or like what?

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.613
MATT: "Oh, all sorts of things
that we were able to gather, muster.

00:14:45.613 --> 00:14:48.290
TRAVIS and SAM: Mustard?
MATT: "Let's just say it's--

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.890
"Muster.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:50.723
"Things we were--

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.470
"If you have some mustard, you're welcome to add it,

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.303
"if you like."

00:14:55.013 --> 00:14:57.490
ASHLEY: I don't have any-- do you have any mustard?

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.532
TALIESIN: I do. I think that'd be a terrible idea, though.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:00.699
MATT: "Fair enough."

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:03.366
(laughter)

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.636
MATT: "Well,

00:15:07.843 --> 00:15:09.220
"if you'd like some."

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.760
And he goes out and points over to Tyffial begins to

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.040
take this large ladle and is expectant.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.907
If you had any sort of bowls or cups or something to--

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.990
MARISHA: Yeah, pull out my canteen.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.840
LAURA: Sure we've got jangle jangles
hanging on our belts and stuff, right?

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.025
TRAVIS: There were a couple of cups--
LAURA: Like the Ren Faire?

00:15:27.025 --> 00:15:29.110
TRAVIS: I think we have at least four or five.
TALIESIN: I've got one.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.201
If anybody doesn't have one,
I'll toss out three cups.

00:15:32.201 --> 00:15:33.310
MARISHA: I imagine it's like Ren Faire.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:34.733
We all have one on our hip.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:38.808
MATT: Yeah, you all have your
casual travel cup, if you will.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.430
MATT: It is a

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.090
curious slop that you can see is

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.660
designed primarily for function,

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.660
not for enjoyment.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.140
And the bit of an alcoholic tinge it has

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.233
is more for interior warmth than any sort of buzz.

00:15:53.768 --> 00:15:54.818
It is not--

00:15:56.485 --> 00:15:59.296
It's a unique flavor. It is--

00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:01.718
It is the Vegemite of the travel world.

00:16:01.718 --> 00:16:03.150
LIAM: (groans)

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.060
MATT: But as it's slopped around,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.510
Lucien glances amongst you all.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.866
Kind of a half-cocked grin.

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:13.399
"No hard feelings."

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.750
TRAVIS: Of course not.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.102
SAM: No, why would there be?

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.670
TRAVIS: I think it's just simple miscommunication.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.820
We're learning how to communicate, I think.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.730
MATT: "Right, right.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.910
"Well, since we're all friends around here,

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.157
"who's got a story to tell?

00:16:27.157 --> 00:16:27.990
"It's quite dark out here

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.403
"and enjoyments, entertainment is hard to come by."

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.252
TRAVIS: Do you spend a lot of time on the sea?

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.260
MATT: "Me? Not particularly, not in a long time."

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.790
TRAVIS: Well, I have a giant Leviathan snake creature

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.803
chasing me every time I set out on the open water.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.020
MATT: "No shit."

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.280
TRAVIS: It's true. Yes.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.850
Apparently, I made some sort of a bargain

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.130
and I have had a hell of a time

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.506
untangling myself from it, let me tell you.

00:16:56.113 --> 00:16:57.321
MATT: "Well.

00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:58.287
"Not every day you meet someone

00:16:58.287 --> 00:17:00.720
"who's being pursued by a sea creature."

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.230
TRAVIS: That's very true.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.350
MATT: "Ah! Good thing you're not far from the water,

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.620
"are you?"

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.405
TRAVIS: Are we far from the water?

00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:09.310
MATT: "For now."

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.160
TRAVIS: Good.
MATT: "We're traveling east.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.426
"Don't go too far east past the mountains."

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.490
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.032
I know what's over there.

00:17:17.032 --> 00:17:20.341
(laughter)

00:17:22.748 --> 00:17:24.388
MARISHA: (clearing throat)

00:17:24.388 --> 00:17:26.380
MATT: "No tales?"

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.233
ASHLEY: This is very chunky.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.486
MATT: "Right, it's meant for chewing."

00:17:31.486 --> 00:17:34.502
TRAVIS: (laughs)
SAM: (disgusted noises)

00:17:34.502 --> 00:17:35.335
ASHLEY: (throat clear)

00:17:35.335 --> 00:17:38.414
I'll have another, I'm not driving.

00:17:41.716 --> 00:17:43.350
TRAVIS: What about you?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.729
I mean, you've obviously made incredible progress

00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:50.850
on your mission, your goals.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.300
Is there a terrible immediacy on your part?

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.123
Any sort of a clock

00:17:56.123 --> 00:17:59.244
or another interested party you might be trying to,

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:01.840
I don't know, arrive before?

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.590
MATT: "Well, I mean...

00:18:04.623 --> 00:18:06.939
"there was one I was a bit concerned about

00:18:06.939 --> 00:18:10.270
"but that was taken cared of."

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.093
TRAVIS: Ah, yes.

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:15.197
MATT: "At the moment there's no...

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.958
"rush beyond just...

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.853
"taking pride in the work one does.

00:18:20.853 --> 00:18:23.830
"And let's just say a bit of impatience for...

00:18:26.466 --> 00:18:27.710
"those goals."

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.131
MARISHA: Tenacity.

00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:33.050
LIAM: Frumpkin pads up through the snow,

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.920
to the circle and just sits

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.090
and begins to turn from speaker to speaker listening.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.148
As you guys talk.

00:18:40.148 --> 00:18:43.298
LAURA: Frumpkin, come sit in my lap!

00:18:43.298 --> 00:18:45.071
Frumpkin.

00:18:45.071 --> 00:18:46.412
LIAM: (cat footsteps)

00:18:46.412 --> 00:18:47.530
LAURA: Yes!

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.536
MATT: "I take it you know about goals."

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.260
LAURA: Goals?

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.520
SAM: We do. We do. We've--

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.941
MATT: "Are you all just wanderers?

00:18:55.941 --> 00:18:58.086
"Or do you have particular things
you're trying to accomplish?"

00:18:58.086 --> 00:18:59.161
LIAM: (meow)

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.190
SAM: No, we all have our own unique set of goals.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.940
Some of them we've made progress on.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.440
And some are just sort of wandering around

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.510
hoping that they'll solve themselves.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.343
MATT: "Right."

00:19:16.343 --> 00:19:17.678
TALIESIN: I'm mostly fine.

00:19:17.678 --> 00:19:21.521
(laughter)

00:19:21.521 --> 00:19:24.530
MATT: "I think there's a story in you somewhere."

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.770
TALIESIN: Well, probably.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.685
I feel like I've been writing my first story

00:19:29.685 --> 00:19:31.502
for the last while.

00:19:31.502 --> 00:19:34.208
I don't know know if it's finished yet.

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.633
I've spent most of my life at home.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.951
MATT: "I got the feeling."

00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:41.227
TALIESIN: Huh. (chuckles)

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.900
SAM: Speaking of your story, Caduceus,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.660
do we know what corrupted your woods yet?

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.345
Did we solve that?

00:19:51.345 --> 00:19:53.340
TALIESIN: We do not actually.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.410
I mean, there's been thoughts in that direction.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.630
I mean, I assume there's been thoughts in that direction.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.070
MARISHA: Why didn't you want to investigate

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.923
the corruption in the woods, in the ruin?

00:20:06.114 --> 00:20:09.216
MARISHA: Were you not--
TALIESIN: It was different.

00:20:09.216 --> 00:20:10.839
It felt different.
MARISHA: How can you be so sure?

00:20:11.872 --> 00:20:14.672
Even if it was different, it could provide answers.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:17.978
TALIESIN: Maybe.

00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:19.675
It--

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.050
I suppose for the same reason that--

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.010
It's one thing to find the bones of something

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.320
that died a long time ago

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.900
versus walking up to something that's still gasping.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.800
So you don't know what's still around.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:42.007
It's not the best metaphor I've ever had, but...

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:44.278
What happened to my home was slow.

00:20:44.278 --> 00:20:45.376
Took time.

00:20:47.123 --> 00:20:50.789
It was just death,

00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:52.972
or at least that's how it felt.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.020
And down there, I don't know what that was.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.350
LAURA: Has the corruption been happening

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.050
since you were born, or did it start after?

00:21:02.224 --> 00:21:04.990
TALIESIN: It started before. Started before.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.330
MATT: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.571
Started before.

00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:10.663
It's been slowly eroding over...

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.070
decades and decades.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.670
SAM: Maybe a collection of wise minds,

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.280
like a Somnovem, could help solve that problem.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.260
TALIESIN: Somnova?

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.777
SAM: Well yeah. Isn't that what they're called?

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.360
MATT: "It's certainly possible."

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.401
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.331
I genuinely haven't thought about it.

00:21:36.443 --> 00:21:39.233
MATT: "How much do you know about the Somnovem?"

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:40.760
SAM: Huh, me?

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.803
MATT: "You."

00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:44.433
SAM: Not-- not particularly much.

00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:46.352
Seems to--

00:21:47.252 --> 00:21:49.248
Well, you know, my--

00:21:49.248 --> 00:21:51.210
my husband is a scientist

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.511
and so he studies the, you know, the root names of things.

00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:58.160
Novum seems like nine, maybe could be.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.540
So, I don't know, something about nine in there.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.631
That's all I kind of gleaned.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.327
MATT: "Then where would you get the strange idea

00:22:05.327 --> 00:22:07.178
"of nine being important?"

00:22:07.178 --> 00:22:08.200
SAM: (laughs)

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.324
Well, you know, I think you're teasing me.

00:22:12.324 --> 00:22:13.733
MATT: "I think you're right.

00:22:15.082 --> 00:22:16.665
"The Somnovem are strange.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.626
"Well, strange is the wrong word.

00:22:21.482 --> 00:22:23.290
"The Somnovem are mad."

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.357
SAM: They're ma-- they're mad, like crazy mad or-- (roar)

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.445
MATT: "More of the former."

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.200
SAM: Oh.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.533
MATT: "Absolutely batty.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.806
"Brilliant, though.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.510
"Quite brilliant.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.109
"Beings-- <i>a</i> being?

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.672
"It's hard to find the right terminology.

"(sighs) Dreams and imagination.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.238
"They have power over matter in the astral realm.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.731
"And when the greatest imaginations become one

"and only know suffering over a thousand years.

"Well, that builds into

"How about you?"

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.120
TALIESIN: Is that what you think you're bringing to it?

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.370
Focus?

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.491
MATT: "No, I'm asking <i>you</i> questions now."

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.002
SAM: What would we know about that, though?

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.590
MATT: "I'm asking if you have imagination."

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.670
SAM: Oh!

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.630
MATT: "Your goals, your future,
the things you want to see.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.700
"The changes you want to bring."

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.060
SAM: Well, there's been a lot of strife

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.330
between the two nations on the continent.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.780
We've definitely tried to help them heal

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.060
and bring peace to the world.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.690
That would be a nice direction

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:15.663
to focus the energy of your wise friends, I guess?

00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:19.018
MATT: "That's a very noble cause."

00:24:21.121 --> 00:24:23.587
LAURA: I would like to domesticate unicorns.

00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:27.580
(stifled laughter)

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.680
LIAM: Frumpkin just goes--

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.770
SAM: For like, um...

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.960
like breeding and racing?

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.700
Or milking? Or--

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.349
LAURA: Like keeping as pets, you know?

00:24:39.349 --> 00:24:40.263
SAM: Cool.

00:24:40.263 --> 00:24:42.588
MATT: Lucien kind of tilts back and goes--

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.320
"Perhaps not quite as noble,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.550
"but equally respectable."

"angel blood?"

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.063
ASHLEY: Me?

MATT: "What depths of your imagination?"

MARISHA: "Angel Blood" is a cool nickname.

00:25:05.328 --> 00:25:08.120
LAURA: (whispering) You can call her that.

00:25:10.887 --> 00:25:12.287
MARISHA: I can't call her the name

00:25:12.287 --> 00:25:14.610
that the mad man just--

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.245
TRAVIS: Sure you can.

00:25:16.245 --> 00:25:17.611
ASHLEY: I think I--

00:25:20.194 --> 00:25:22.994
I have quite an imagination, but...

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.941
I don't fully know what my goals are yet.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.520
MATT: "That's okay."

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.068
SAM: Would you want to discover more about your lost time?

00:25:42.232 --> 00:25:43.771
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:25:43.771 --> 00:25:44.965
ASHLEY: Uh...

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.260
yes and no, I--

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.010
I forget that you don't know (sighing)

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.433
a lot about me already.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.818
But, um...

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.863
there's a period of time that I lost,

00:26:08.027 --> 00:26:09.943
and I don't know how long it was.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.370
And I don't fully know what I did.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.845
But I know, um...

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.583
it probably wasn't all good.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.250
MATT: "Maybe it's best left in the past."

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.983
ASHLEY: Sometimes I think that.

00:26:25.239 --> 00:26:26.988
MATT: "Well,

00:26:26.988 --> 00:26:29.820
"maybe you're just not ripe yet.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.280
"Maybe a goal will find its way to you in time.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.518
"There's no rush."

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:35.983
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.030
MATT: "I take it yours is to cut free this

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.073
"terrifying sea serpent that wants vengeance?"

00:26:45.777 --> 00:26:49.590
TRAVIS: Actually, I'm enjoying sort of him being

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:54.210
on my tail, at least gives me an idea of where he is.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.300
Better the enemy that you know

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.080
than the one that you don't, yes?

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.530
MATT: "True to that."

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.970
TRAVIS: It's more like wanting to...

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.163
close the book on him on <i>my</i> terms.

00:27:04.163 --> 00:27:05.840
I think I have the ability to do that as well.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.127
Just take a few more steps.

00:27:10.127 --> 00:27:11.235
MATT: "All right.

00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:14.923
"What about you?"

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.030
MARISHA: What are my goals or do I have an imagination?

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.001
You've asked a few questions.

00:27:23.001 --> 00:27:24.620
MATT: "Goals take imagination."

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.830
MARISHA: Yes, they do.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.601
MATT: "So, what do you imagine your goals to be?"

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.230
MARISHA: It's interesting.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.510
Kind of at a point where

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.143
I've achieved a lot of my larger goals.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.685
Now I'm just following open doors.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.251
This being the latest.

00:27:51.598 --> 00:27:52.506
MATT: "Hm."

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.003
MARISHA: I think this will inform
my future goals pretty heavily.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.383
MATT: "Fair enough.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.360
"You said you're set in your story."

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.351
TALIESIN: Well.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.370
You asked what I wanted and I think I figured it out.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.335
I want to,

00:28:16.024 --> 00:28:17.160
change a heart

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.000
and a mind, and save a soul.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.065
This one.
MATT: "Well.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.738
"There's a lot in the world...

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.450
"not yet discovered.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.610
"And a lot of possibility...

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.970
"yet to be harnessed.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.790
"How about you?"

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.300
LIAM: I'm not there.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.328
MATT: Oh, that's right, you--
LIAM: But--

00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:46.461
MATT: He says to the cat.

00:28:46.461 --> 00:28:48.070
(laughter)

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.653
LIAM: Then he hears-- only he-- in his ear, hears:

00:28:55.986 --> 00:28:58.460
You seem to know a lot about this...

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.393
entity.

00:29:00.393 --> 00:29:02.360
What makes you think you could bend its power

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.750
to your wishes in the first place?

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.081
TRAVIS: Only Lucien hears that?

00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:08.342
LIAM: He's using the Message spell.

00:29:08.342 --> 00:29:09.268
MATT: He responds and you guys--

00:29:09.268 --> 00:29:12.076
LIAM: That is from Jester's lap. It's just like this.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.458
MATT: You hear the response, though all the rest of you

00:29:15.458 --> 00:29:17.491
just see him staring at Frumpkin.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.809
LAURA: (whispering) Why is he staring at my lap?

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.697
MATT: "You presume much, broody one.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.766
"But...

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.000
"I see a lot of curiosity in you, too.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.678
"Perhaps we're more alike than you'd think."

00:29:36.678 --> 00:29:39.643
LIAM: Well, there is much I would like to do

00:29:39.643 --> 00:29:42.713
with my years left in this world.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.067
MATT: You see him break his eye contact with Frumpkin.

00:29:48.067 --> 00:29:49.900
(laughter)

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.801
TALIESIN: Where does your imagination lie?

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.630
MATT: "Got a few ideas.

00:30:01.475 --> 00:30:02.855
"Some of them vengeful,

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.250
"some of them curious,

"I don't know.

"Wild."

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.910
LAURA: Do the Somnovem make you nervous?

00:30:25.712 --> 00:30:27.128
MATT: "They did at first.

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:30.697
"But I've met them.

00:30:30.697 --> 00:30:32.228
"<i>Truly</i> met them, once.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.545
"I don't know, feels like we're family."

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.650
LAURA: Do you think you can control them?

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.570
MATT: "I don't think I can control them,

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:49.810
"but I think I have something to offer."

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.893
MARISHA: You want to be a part of them.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.526
MATT: "I have some ideas to be mutually beneficial."

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.190
MARISHA: You said that they were mad.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.853
Do you consider yourself to be mad?

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.214
MATT: "Well, I think it takes--

00:31:14.214 --> 00:31:19.208
"takes a bit of madness to truly unlock the imagination."

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.928
TALIESIN: What could they possibly want?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.170
Can't even imagine.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.136
MATT: "Well, continue along with us.

00:31:30.136 --> 00:31:32.095
"Maybe you could ask them yourself."

00:31:33.276 --> 00:31:34.800
TALIESIN: I'm curious of your opinion.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.730
TRAVIS: Do we know how old he is?

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.246
LIAM: Lucien?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:31:39.173 --> 00:31:40.050
LIAM: I don't think so.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.141
MATT: You don't.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.210
"Well, this has been a fine bit of conversation.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.228
"But every one of you look a bit knackered.

"I appreciate the comfort.

"Hope you enjoyed the--

"What would you call this, Zoran?"

00:31:57.823 --> 00:32:01.170
He sits there chewing something heavy in his jaw and goes,

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.191
"Shit."

00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:04.210

SAM: You too.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.530
Thanks for the... chowder.

TRAVIS: ♪ Thanks for the shit ♪

MATT: (laughs)

00:32:26.008 --> 00:32:27.069
TALIESIN: I didn't really touch my cup,

00:32:27.069 --> 00:32:29.630
so I'm going to bring it back for Caleb.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.850
LAURA: I didn't realize we were talking about larger goals.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.400
You know, like life goals.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.000
I just thought we were talking about things we want.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.427
SAM: I never knew that was in your--

00:32:41.427 --> 00:32:42.770
LAURA: I mean, I think it would be cool.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.854
I don't know if--
SAM: Sounds so crazy.

00:32:44.854 --> 00:32:45.687
TALIESIN: Pretty good idea.

00:32:45.687 --> 00:32:48.010
SAM: Like as a business or--?

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.790
LAURA: Who knows? I think it would be great.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.816
I don't know if <i>I</i> even want to do it.

00:32:52.816 --> 00:32:54.570
I just want somebody to do it.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.080
SAM: Have you ever seen a unicorn?

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.810
LAURA: Yeah, of course I've seen unicorns.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.007
Obviously.

00:33:02.638 --> 00:33:03.546
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:03.546 --> 00:33:06.530
TRAVIS: I thought they were rare.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.120
LAURA: Well, I have the gift.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.000

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.515
LAURA: What is this, a child's fairytale?

00:33:13.515 --> 00:33:14.950
SAM: I don't know. I've never seen one.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:15.832
How did you see these?

00:33:15.832 --> 00:33:17.310
TRAVIS: Have you seen a real unicorn?

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.202
LAURA: The Traveler has shown me many things.

00:33:20.202 --> 00:33:21.910
ASHLEY: I didn't-- I didn't--

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.790
I don't think I knew that they were real.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.063
fake stuff?

00:33:36.737 --> 00:33:38.060
They're super real.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.090
ASHLEY: I think that'd be pretty
cool if they were domesticated.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.265
LAURA: What, do you think fairies are fake, too, you guys?

00:33:44.265 --> 00:33:45.850
SAM: No! No.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.198
Those are clearly real.

00:33:47.198 --> 00:33:48.233
ASHLEY: Very real.

00:33:48.233 --> 00:33:50.041
LAURA: Fairies are real.

00:33:50.041 --> 00:33:50.874
They're real.

00:33:50.874 --> 00:33:54.060
TRAVIS: Okay. I've never seen a fairy either, so--

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.000
TALIESIN: Fairies is one thing,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.930
but a protruding growth on the head of a horse,

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.198
that's just madness.

00:33:59.198 --> 00:34:01.865
(laughter)

00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:04.210
MARISHA: It's a horn.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.398
It's a horn, Caduceus.

00:34:05.398 --> 00:34:06.740
TALIESIN: It's just weird.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.520
I don't think that's possible.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.835
Neither man or nature.

00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:11.781
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:13.110
ASHLEY: What would you have told him, though?

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.130
If-- you know?

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.896
LAURA: I don't know.

00:34:18.015 --> 00:34:19.243
SAM: Get your mom and dad back together?

00:34:19.243 --> 00:34:21.206
LAURA: That's kind of what I'm thinking.

00:34:21.206 --> 00:34:22.082
SAM: Want to go back and tell him?

00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:23.300
LAURA: No! Why would I tell him that?

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.361
SAM: I thought we were sharing personal things.

00:34:25.361 --> 00:34:26.580
LAURA: No, I'm not going to run up to him and go,

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.892
"Hey, I want my mom and dad to get back together."

00:34:28.892 --> 00:34:30.880
TRAVIS: Remember, the last time we shared something.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.580
We shared a vial of our blood

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.870
and that did no favors for us.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.670
LIAM: You know, you don't have to stand outside of the dome.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.356
You can come inside of the dome.

00:34:38.356 --> 00:34:39.406
LAURA: Oh. Hi, Caleb.
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

00:34:39.406 --> 00:34:41.142
LIAM: Hello.
LAURA: Here's your cat.

00:34:41.142 --> 00:34:42.242
LIAM: (cat noise)

00:34:42.242 --> 00:34:43.763
TALIESIN: And your shit.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.540
LIAM: What is this?

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.956
ASHLEY: It's delicious.
TALIESIN: It's shit, apparently.

00:34:46.956 --> 00:34:47.893
LAURA: Chewy shit.

00:34:47.893 --> 00:34:49.582
TRAVIS: So good.

00:34:49.582 --> 00:34:52.690
LAURA: Not as warm-- oh ho ho ho ho ho ho.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.989
MARISHA: I am a bit bothered by one thing.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.860
LAURA: (laughs)

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.886
What is it?

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.910
MARISHA: Well, now I'm bothered by another thing.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.320
What the fuck is that?

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.153
Oh god.

00:35:05.153 --> 00:35:08.780
(laughter)

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.613
LIAM: That's just math.

00:35:09.613 --> 00:35:12.260
(laughter)

00:35:13.867 --> 00:35:16.713
MARISHA: The man has asked us, like, three times,

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.160
our goals as a group.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.463
And we sort of dance around them every time.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.360
We sort of have an amorphous idea

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.970
of what we're doing and what we would like to accomplish.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.870
And that's more or less

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.130
just stopping whatever the hell he's doing.

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:33.963
But--

00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:37.166
(sighing)

00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:38.833
LIAM: You also to wonder why he's even tolerating

00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:40.540
us being around.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.688
SAM: Can I share a crazy conspiracy theory

00:35:42.688 --> 00:35:44.457
that I just had when we were talking to him?

00:35:44.457 --> 00:35:47.532
LIAM: I have a feeling like you're going to.
SAM: I don't think this is true,

00:35:47.532 --> 00:35:49.410
but, you know,

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.560
I think a little bit of you have rubbed off on me.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.393
MARISHA: I love it.

00:35:53.393 --> 00:35:54.480
SAM: I'm seeing everything.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.677
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:35:55.677 --> 00:35:57.394
Give it to me. Nom, nom, nom.
SAM: All right.

00:35:57.394 --> 00:35:58.550
So he was talking about the

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:00.920
some navum, Somnovem.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.829
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Oh.

00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:03.245
LAURA: A little quieter.

00:36:03.245 --> 00:36:04.078
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:36:04.078 --> 00:36:05.861
LAURA: We're talking quieter now.

00:36:05.861 --> 00:36:06.800
MATT: Okay.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.270
TALIESIN: Or can you do the--

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.264
SAM: He's talking about the Sum-nah-vum.

00:36:10.264 --> 00:36:11.097
Novum.

00:36:11.097 --> 00:36:12.697
MARISHA: Some-- somnavahm.

00:36:13.647 --> 00:36:15.270
SAM: He described them.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:18.210
He described them as a collection of individuals

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.450
who together were much more powerful

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.250
than they were apart.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.070
And that they were aimless.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:28.040
He's also told us that we have a particular role

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.620
in whatever this ceremony thing is that he's going to do.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.650
So my conspiracy theory is--

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:34.483
MARISHA: We're the--

00:36:34.483 --> 00:36:35.666
SAM: Yes.
MARISHA: The bodies.

00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:36.881
SAM: We're the Somnovem.

00:36:36.881 --> 00:36:37.714
MARISHA: We're the Somnovem.

00:36:37.714 --> 00:36:40.372
SAM: That's my conspiracy theory.
MARISHA: We're going to be the proxies.

00:36:40.372 --> 00:36:41.740
SAM: We're the Mighty Nein.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.407
The Nein eyes.
LAURA: We need one more, though,

00:36:43.407 --> 00:36:46.980
if Molly's going to be one, too-- Lucien.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.346
MARISHA: Well.
LIAM: That would potentially

00:36:48.346 --> 00:36:50.862
answer my question, which is

00:36:50.862 --> 00:36:53.098
why haven't they tried to kill us yet?

00:36:53.098 --> 00:36:54.326
MARISHA: Well, we already know that

00:36:54.326 --> 00:36:57.880
he wants something to do with us there.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.960
Or else he would've.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.960
LAURA: I hope my Somnovem is super hot.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.410
SAM: Wait, wouldn't it just be you?

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.700
Or--

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.157
LAURA: Oh, well, I guess that's true.

00:37:07.157 --> 00:37:08.230
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.990
LAURA: I hope it's got a hot personality.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.031
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.

00:37:11.031 --> 00:37:12.164
MARISHA: Hot on the inside.

00:37:12.164 --> 00:37:12.997
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:14.058
SAM: Yeah.

00:37:14.058 --> 00:37:15.981
That's what you mean when you say hot.

00:37:15.981 --> 00:37:17.431
Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.760
MARISHA: I like that theory.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.030
SAM: Yeah, they need bodies.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.010
And we're the bodies

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.270
that they they're going to go into.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:25.103
But they're not.

00:37:25.103 --> 00:37:26.760
Because we're going to stop this from happening.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.880
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.750
How many of them are there?

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:32.790
There's five.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.760
LAURA: Oh no, what if he doesn't need all of us?

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.593
What if they--

00:37:35.593 --> 00:37:37.816
Somnovem get to pick which ones they like best.

00:37:37.816 --> 00:37:40.190
SAM: You think they're going to pick them over us?

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.210
Look at you and look at Otis.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.630
Look at <i>you</i> and look at <i>Otis</i>.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.463
Come on.

00:37:46.463 --> 00:37:48.056
MATT: You glance over across the way
and see Otis sitting there going--

00:37:48.056 --> 00:37:50.848
(messy eating sounds)

00:37:50.848 --> 00:37:52.764
MARISHA: (laughs)
SAM: Come on.

00:37:52.764 --> 00:37:55.510
LIAM: Which direction is Lucien looking at the moment?

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.750
MATT: Lucien is across the fire,

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:57.583
but looking in your direction.

00:37:57.583 --> 00:37:58.720
LIAM: Yeah.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.310
Yeah, so there are no secrets here.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:02.143
Hello?

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.730
MARISHA: Did he react?

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.110
LAURA: Sometimes he doesn't react to us.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.567
Sometimes he does.

00:38:07.567 --> 00:38:10.517
MATT: You can make a--

00:38:10.517 --> 00:38:12.250
make an insight check to see if you

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.110
make out any sort of flinch or reaction at this distance.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.170
MARISHA: Okay.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.836
Poop. 15.

00:38:17.836 --> 00:38:19.440
MATT: 15. Is it hard to see this distance.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.306
He does have the campfire in his face, which is helpful.

00:38:21.306 --> 00:38:23.520
But you're-- you know, you're far enough away

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.953
to where you can't quite see any sort of flinch.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.080
MARISHA: I mean, that makes sense to me,

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.080
especially considering he is a proxy himself, right?

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.540
And he's already been several different people,

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.373
I guess.

00:38:39.373 --> 00:38:41.108
I don't know how this shit works.

00:38:41.108 --> 00:38:43.657
So--
TRAVIS: Yeah, he said he met them once.

00:38:43.657 --> 00:38:44.810
And you were like, (incoherent noises)

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:45.960
MARISHA: I'm assuming when he was,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.875
like, fractured in pieces in the Astral Sea.

00:38:48.875 --> 00:38:50.269
It was just floating around.

00:38:50.269 --> 00:38:51.767
TRAVIS: So how old do we think-- like,

00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:55.680
did he exist before Mollymauk's physical form.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.960
And he just took that one over

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.420
or is Mollymauk, like, thousands of years old?

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.253
And--

00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:02.420
MARISHA: I don't think so because it doesn't seem like

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.530
Lucien was really keyed into this whole thing

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.600
until he discovered that book

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.968
when he was with the Tomb Takers.
TRAVIS: Right.

00:39:08.968 --> 00:39:11.950
MARISHA: Kind of feels like that was his big, you know,

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.301
turning on point of this whole Somnovem situation.

00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:18.240
LAURA: Then who was he before?

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.314
Was he always Lucien?

00:39:20.314 --> 00:39:22.508
And then the Somnovem came.

00:39:22.508 --> 00:39:25.319
TRAVIS: Yeah, was it Lucien, Molly and Molly, Lucien or--

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.205
MARISHA: Like Lucien--

00:39:29.205 --> 00:39:30.860
LAURA: Lucien like normal--
MARISHA: Molly.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.590
LAURA: -- normal bad guy, right?

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.568
Then the thing takes place.

00:39:34.568 --> 00:39:37.670
Lucien filled with a lot of other people, bad guy.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:41.540
MARISHA: Well, it was kind of
Lucien and Molly at the same time

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.680
because it was a fraction of Lucien,

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.038
that found its way back

00:39:47.038 --> 00:39:48.538
to its body.
LAURA: Right. Right.

00:39:48.538 --> 00:39:49.940
And then that kind of grew.
LIAM: Didn't Cree--

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.873
MARISHA: Huh?
LIAM: Didn't Cree

00:39:50.873 --> 00:39:52.373
refer to him as Nonagon

00:39:52.373 --> 00:39:54.190
when we first ran into Cree?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.025
LIAM: Which would make one think it was Lucien Cree--

00:39:57.025 --> 00:40:00.843
or Lucien Nonagon or Lucien/Nonagon, then Molly.

00:40:00.843 --> 00:40:04.030
LAURA: Right. Lucien, maybe born Lucien.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.330
They performed a ritual.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:06.531
He became Lucien Nonagon.

00:40:06.531 --> 00:40:07.830
LIAM: Spiffy new title.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:10.081
LAURA: Totally. Things happen.

00:40:10.081 --> 00:40:12.340
Another ritual gets fucked up.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.430
Nonagon Lucien gets taken away.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:16.730
Little particle Molly stays in body.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.210
MARISHA: Yes.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.020
LAURA: Stays with us for a while.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.890
ASHLEY: It's still a piece of Lucien.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.857
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: He's in there.

00:40:23.857 --> 00:40:27.222
LAURA: Unless Molly Molly, that
portion died when Molly died.

00:40:27.222 --> 00:40:29.170
And then old Lucien came in

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.630
and now he's missing the one good part that he used to have,

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.771
which was Molly.

00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:34.450
SAM: How do we get that part back in him?

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.930
MARISHA: I think that part is in him.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.190
I think it's just,

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.400
he's the perfect case study

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.023
for if you harbor

00:40:44.023 --> 00:40:46.819
and foster

00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:48.230
the good side of somebody

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:51.170
as opposed to indulge in the worst side.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.361
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Although, I mean,

00:40:53.361 --> 00:40:55.027
not to speak ill of the dead or anything,

00:40:55.027 --> 00:40:58.600
but, like, Mollymauk wasn't all good, right?

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.210
MARISHA: I see so much of Molly in Lucien.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.470
That's what's trippy about it,

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.210
is you can see that piece of him.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.740
LIAM: I don't think it's so much good and bad.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.680
It's more Id and Ego and Super Ego.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.522
I think that Mollymauk perhaps is--

00:41:10.522 --> 00:41:15.139
SAM: You Zemnians with your psychoanalytical.

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:18.186
LIAM: Look, sometimes a tiefling is just a tiefling.

00:41:18.186 --> 00:41:21.020
(laughter)

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.909
MARISHA: Sometimes a cult leader is just a cult leader.

00:41:23.909 --> 00:41:24.742
TALIESIN: We had a--

00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:29.047
We had a squirrel, back home that--

00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:31.587
LAURA: I like this story.
LIAM: Yep.

00:41:31.587 --> 00:41:33.264
TALIESIN: Lived--
LIAM: Go on.

00:41:33.264 --> 00:41:34.097
TALIESIN: We had a squirrel back home

00:41:34.097 --> 00:41:37.719
that lived in a tree that was just outside the

00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:42.339
furthest old walls of the grounds.

00:41:42.339 --> 00:41:43.977
LAURA: Did you feed it corn?

00:41:43.977 --> 00:41:46.305
TALIESIN: Oh, we didn't have corn, but we did feed it nuts.

00:41:46.305 --> 00:41:48.154
LAURA: Oh, that's good, too.
TALIESIN: So.

00:41:48.154 --> 00:41:52.879
He was adorable, he was hand-raised,

00:41:52.879 --> 00:41:54.527
very tame.

00:41:54.527 --> 00:41:58.317
And then one day, just

00:41:58.317 --> 00:42:00.347
turned, got mean.

00:42:00.347 --> 00:42:02.807
LAURA: Did he get rabies?

00:42:02.807 --> 00:42:04.929
TALIESIN: Well, that was what happened, yeah.

00:42:04.929 --> 00:42:07.701
(laughter)

00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:08.779
SAM: What is this story?

00:42:08.779 --> 00:42:10.667
TRAVIS: Why?! What?!

00:42:10.667 --> 00:42:14.927
TALIESIN: Story is, sometimes something from outside

00:42:14.927 --> 00:42:17.090
can get into a person and change them.

00:42:18.717 --> 00:42:21.747
Just change them utterly, and that thing,

00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:22.947
you don't know how old it is,

00:42:22.947 --> 00:42:24.417
where it came from necessarily.

00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:27.387
But it is-- it's not that they stopped being them,

00:42:27.387 --> 00:42:30.017
they just start being something else

00:42:30.017 --> 00:42:32.327
that may be older, may be darker.

00:42:32.327 --> 00:42:36.387
ASHLEY: So, Lucien is Molly's rabies?

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.407
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I think Nonagon

00:42:37.407 --> 00:42:40.137
is Lucien's rabies.
MARISHA: Lucien's rabies, yeah.

00:42:40.137 --> 00:42:42.058
SAM: What a crazy phrase!

00:42:42.058 --> 00:42:44.475
(laughter)

00:42:49.277 --> 00:42:51.280
ASHLEY: Essentially, it's fucked.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.477
Basically.
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:42:54.477 --> 00:42:56.157
Well--
LIAM: I find myself wondering

00:42:56.157 --> 00:43:00.967
if Lucien truly discovered Somnovem,

00:43:00.967 --> 00:43:03.250
or if they discovered him or chose him,

00:43:05.257 --> 00:43:07.577
and I just assume he's listening to me.

00:43:07.577 --> 00:43:09.527
TALIESIN: I think they discovered and chose us.

00:43:10.467 --> 00:43:12.267
LIAM: Well, I think that is true, but...

00:43:14.277 --> 00:43:16.307
LAURA: Why don't we just ask him?

00:43:16.307 --> 00:43:18.797
MARISHA: Right now?
LIAM: We kind of are right now.

00:43:18.797 --> 00:43:19.717
MARISHA: You want us--
SAM: I don't think

00:43:19.717 --> 00:43:20.611
he can hear us.

00:43:20.611 --> 00:43:23.487
LIAM: I do.
MARISHA: Stick our head out the dome?

00:43:23.487 --> 00:43:24.490
Invite him in?

00:43:25.707 --> 00:43:27.687
TALIESIN: Maybe tomorrow when we're--

00:43:28.757 --> 00:43:30.707
I don't know about waking people up at this point.

00:43:30.707 --> 00:43:32.507
I also, I don't know about the rest of you,

00:43:32.507 --> 00:43:34.127
I need to sleep.

00:43:34.127 --> 00:43:35.318
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:35.318 --> 00:43:37.087
I'm going to send a message.

00:43:37.087 --> 00:43:38.287
MATT: To?

00:43:38.287 --> 00:43:40.137
LAURA: Lucien.
MATT: Okay.

00:43:40.137 --> 00:43:42.077
SAM: Wait. Will it work?

00:43:42.077 --> 00:43:42.910
LAURA: Why not?

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.743
LIAM: He's right over there.

00:43:43.743 --> 00:43:45.437
SAM: Aren't we in, like, a magic-free dome?

00:43:45.437 --> 00:43:46.270
LIAM and LAURA: No.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.937
SAM: Oh, that's not how it works?

00:43:47.937 --> 00:43:50.127
MATT: No, it's just a comfortable dome.

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.857
SAM: Wait, it doesn't keep all magic out?

00:43:51.857 --> 00:43:52.690
TRAVIS: Nope!
MATT: No,

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:54.348
it can keep creatures out, if he wants it to.

00:43:54.348 --> 00:43:56.237
SAM: I didn't know that!

00:43:56.237 --> 00:43:57.407
MATT: And things like that.
LAURA: We're not as safe

00:43:57.407 --> 00:43:58.240
as you thought we were!

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.553
SAM: No!
TRAVIS: My browser history

00:43:59.553 --> 00:44:00.386
is compromised!
SAM: I thought we'd been

00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:02.602
completely safe this whole time!

00:44:02.602 --> 00:44:04.037
MARISHA: It's, like, a level two spell. (laughs)

00:44:04.037 --> 00:44:04.969
SAM: Oh god!

00:44:04.969 --> 00:44:07.237
(laughter)

00:44:07.237 --> 00:44:08.794
I've been sleeping naked!
TRAVIS: Never sleep again.

00:44:08.794 --> 00:44:10.177
LAURA: It's not even a full sphere, like,

00:44:10.177 --> 00:44:12.997
people can burrow underneath it, you know?

00:44:12.997 --> 00:44:14.331
It's just a little dome.

00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:15.517
SAM: They've never done that, so.

00:44:15.517 --> 00:44:17.027
MATT: No, I think it does have

00:44:17.027 --> 00:44:18.327
some defensive capabilities there.

00:44:18.327 --> 00:44:19.167
LIAM: It sure does.

00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:20.237
MATT: Yeah, it's been a little bit

00:44:20.237 --> 00:44:22.137
since I remembered that, but.

00:44:22.137 --> 00:44:24.547
MARISHA: It's temperature controlled.
LIAM: And also, rules as written,

00:44:24.547 --> 00:44:26.947
I have come to read that it does have a bottom,

00:44:26.947 --> 00:44:29.717
but <i>ours</i> doesn't because ours doesn't.

00:44:29.717 --> 00:44:32.217
MARISHA: Oh.
SAM: Interesting.

00:44:33.977 --> 00:44:36.034
MARISHA: Is it like a ball?

00:44:36.034 --> 00:44:38.442
And the bottom half of it is just underneath?

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:39.275
Is that how it works?

00:44:39.275 --> 00:44:40.559
LIAM: I don't know.

00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:41.392
I like it--
MARISHA: Magic.

00:44:41.392 --> 00:44:42.787
LIAM: I like it like an upside down bowl.

00:44:42.787 --> 00:44:44.987
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, just a bloop!

00:44:44.987 --> 00:44:46.337
LIAM: Yep.

00:44:46.337 --> 00:44:48.198
LAURA: I'm send a message to Lucien.

00:44:48.198 --> 00:44:49.798
TRAVIS: I'ma send a message!
LAURA: I'ma send a message

00:44:49.798 --> 00:44:51.448
to Lucien.
MATT: All right, go for it.

00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:53.788
LAURA: Were you....

00:44:55.757 --> 00:44:58.910
born as a baby Nonagon?

00:45:00.677 --> 00:45:03.700
Or were you baby Lucien and Nonagon came in?

00:45:04.777 --> 00:45:07.040
Just wondering how it works.

00:45:10.877 --> 00:45:13.217
MATT: You see him shift his head slightly

00:45:13.217 --> 00:45:14.882
across the way.

00:45:14.882 --> 00:45:16.198
And then--
LAURA: I peek my head out

00:45:16.198 --> 00:45:17.477
of the dome and look him in the eye

00:45:17.477 --> 00:45:19.127
while I'm waiting for the answer.

00:45:19.997 --> 00:45:23.197
MATT: He quietly responds to the spell,

00:45:23.197 --> 00:45:24.677
though it comes to you-- it's like watching somebody

00:45:24.677 --> 00:45:25.807
who's calling you on the phone,

00:45:25.807 --> 00:45:27.273
but they're just around the corner.

00:45:27.273 --> 00:45:28.817
LAURA: Yeah.

00:45:28.817 --> 00:45:30.949
MATT: Slight delay, it's a little weird.

00:45:30.949 --> 00:45:34.550
And then he goes, "Well, I've always been Lucien.

00:45:35.452 --> 00:45:39.717
"The Nonagon just was the next path I discovered."

00:45:39.717 --> 00:45:41.410
MARISHA: Cult leadership.

00:45:43.187 --> 00:45:44.020
LAURA: Oh.

00:45:45.357 --> 00:45:46.717
Okay.

00:45:46.717 --> 00:45:47.550
(louder) Okay!

00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:50.567
MATT: "Sleep well!"

00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:51.400
LAURA: You, too!

00:45:52.447 --> 00:45:55.814
Or don't. (stammers)

00:45:55.814 --> 00:45:57.607
MATT: (laughs)

00:45:57.607 --> 00:46:00.257
LAURA: He was a baby, he used to be a baby.

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:02.197
You know, like a Lucien baby.

00:46:02.197 --> 00:46:05.807
TRAVIS: So, Lucien baby, then Molly, then Lucien.

00:46:05.807 --> 00:46:07.097
LAURA: Oh, no, I don't know about that.

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:09.897
Lucien baby, found the Nonagon...

00:46:11.386 --> 00:46:12.497
TRAVIS: (sighs)

00:46:12.497 --> 00:46:14.767
LAURA: It wasn't like-- it wasn't-- what I'm saying is,

00:46:14.767 --> 00:46:16.287
I don't think it was like...

00:46:17.227 --> 00:46:19.357
Like how the Beacon works, you know?

00:46:19.357 --> 00:46:21.397
Where the souls come into the body

00:46:21.397 --> 00:46:23.427
right when they're born and they discover it.

00:46:23.427 --> 00:46:24.759
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:24.759 --> 00:46:28.222
LIAM: He just self-actualized somewhere along the road.

00:46:28.222 --> 00:46:29.517
TALIESIN: That's not--
MARISHA: He read a book

00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:32.488
and he was like, "That sounds like a cool title."

00:46:32.488 --> 00:46:34.867
(laughter)

00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:36.377
LIAM: What was that, Beauregard?

00:46:36.377 --> 00:46:38.900
MARISHA: I'm just throwing shade.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.567
LIAM: I want to hear your shade.

00:46:41.567 --> 00:46:43.417
MARISHA: I said he read a book and he picked a title.

00:46:43.417 --> 00:46:44.307
LIAM: Yeah.

00:46:44.307 --> 00:46:46.967
MARISHA: I think there is a certain amount to this

00:46:46.967 --> 00:46:50.617
in which whatever he found in that book,

00:46:50.617 --> 00:46:53.700
so much more would be clear if he would let us read it.

00:46:55.437 --> 00:46:57.477
It's probably some element

00:46:57.477 --> 00:46:59.527
where he had to be open-minded

00:46:59.527 --> 00:47:03.507
to let the Somnovem in, right?

00:47:03.507 --> 00:47:05.097
Like...

00:47:05.097 --> 00:47:07.677
Little bit of column A, little bit of column B.

00:47:07.677 --> 00:47:09.707
Someone who was willing to...

00:47:11.757 --> 00:47:14.817
Hear voices from the Astral Sea?

00:47:14.817 --> 00:47:16.267
TALIESIN: Tempted.
LIAM: We are talking

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:17.840
about something very great.

00:47:19.017 --> 00:47:21.897
Something very beyond the ken...

00:47:24.727 --> 00:47:25.560
of knowing.

00:47:27.567 --> 00:47:29.652
It's a good theory, though.

00:47:29.652 --> 00:47:31.914
SAM: What's our plan for tomorrow morning?

00:47:31.914 --> 00:47:33.877
Are we supposed to just hike towards--

00:47:33.877 --> 00:47:37.042
are we going to number one now?

00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:38.687
Is that it? We have what we need?

00:47:38.687 --> 00:47:42.087
TRAVIS: We told Essek we were on the way a while ago,

00:47:42.087 --> 00:47:44.877
but yes, I believe we're going towards A1.

00:47:44.877 --> 00:47:47.377
MARISHA: Gosh, and then there's Essek.

00:47:47.377 --> 00:47:49.157
TRAVIS: We're going to be trying super, super buddy

00:47:49.157 --> 00:47:50.837
with Lucien tomorrow so that you guys

00:47:50.837 --> 00:47:53.675
can take a look at the book?

00:47:53.675 --> 00:47:55.277
We've got a day left.

00:47:55.277 --> 00:47:56.607
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:57.807
That should be our mission tomorrow.

00:47:57.807 --> 00:47:59.907
TRAVIS: No killing anyone, no trying to subvert

00:47:59.907 --> 00:48:01.830
the other members, no, okay.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.517
LAURA: I gave him a tarot card reading.

00:48:03.517 --> 00:48:04.927
LIAM: Yeah? How did he take it?

00:48:04.927 --> 00:48:06.907
LAURA: He seemed bothered by it.

00:48:06.907 --> 00:48:08.337
MARISHA: I was watching that.

00:48:08.337 --> 00:48:10.277
LAURA: Did you see his hand shaking?

00:48:10.277 --> 00:48:13.377
MARISHA: It twitched at the word rebirth.

00:48:13.377 --> 00:48:14.210
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:19.147
SAM: Did you fake it, or was it a real reading?

00:48:19.147 --> 00:48:21.897
LAURA: Obviously it was super real.

00:48:21.897 --> 00:48:23.248
Yeah.

00:48:23.248 --> 00:48:25.000
TRAVIS: Obviously. Come on, Veth.
LIAM: They tend to be both.

00:48:26.517 --> 00:48:28.577
MARISHA: Let's remember that.

00:48:28.577 --> 00:48:29.920
He's superstitious.

00:48:31.607 --> 00:48:34.467
TRAVIS: Or we just say the word rebirth and then we strike!

00:48:34.467 --> 00:48:36.470
MARISHA: Yeah. It's like his code.

00:48:37.624 --> 00:48:40.075
TRAVIS: Ahh, rebirth, argh!

00:48:40.075 --> 00:48:41.278
(laughter)

00:48:41.278 --> 00:48:43.070
SAM: It'll make him just fire his magic,

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:44.677
just a little bit off.

00:48:44.677 --> 00:48:47.377
MARISHA: Gosh, it's so frustrating because we just need

00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:48.670
a little bit more info.

00:48:50.195 --> 00:48:53.187
Feel like we're at the cusp of what we know.

00:48:53.187 --> 00:48:54.887
LIAM: So does he.

00:48:54.887 --> 00:48:56.907
MARISHA: He was rambling about dreams, too,

00:48:56.907 --> 00:48:59.647
and he was like, "Oh, I don't sleep, but I dream."

00:48:59.647 --> 00:49:04.227
And also the Somnovem are dreams, but also people,

00:49:04.227 --> 00:49:06.557
but also maybe just one of them.

00:49:06.557 --> 00:49:08.227
LIAM: Well, he knows quite a bit,

00:49:08.227 --> 00:49:09.452
but I think, like Mollymauk,

00:49:09.452 --> 00:49:11.098
he's a bit of a flim-flam man.

00:49:13.267 --> 00:49:16.544
And we're in a game of chicken here.

00:49:16.544 --> 00:49:18.961
(laughter)

00:49:21.353 --> 00:49:23.120
Caduceus, you have something to say?

00:49:24.224 --> 00:49:25.724
TALIESIN: Somewhere up there, all right.

00:49:28.597 --> 00:49:31.027
MARISHA: What are we doing with this threshold crest?

00:49:31.027 --> 00:49:32.777
We were having a conversation about

00:49:32.777 --> 00:49:34.727
if we try it and teleport away with it.

00:49:35.927 --> 00:49:37.237
TRAVIS: Now we're being super, super quiet!

00:49:37.237 --> 00:49:38.777
TALIESIN: Is there any way--
SAM: Even more quiet.

00:49:38.777 --> 00:49:41.237
MARISHA: Yeah, this is all super quiet!

00:49:41.237 --> 00:49:43.547
TALIESIN: Is there any way we can make sure

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:45.677
that our continued survival is attached

00:49:45.677 --> 00:49:47.440
to whether or not it's accessible?

00:49:53.597 --> 00:49:57.617
TRAVIS: I mean, if Caleb's theory is true,

00:49:57.617 --> 00:50:00.167
the threshold crest really doesn't matter, does it?

00:50:03.507 --> 00:50:05.447
MARISHA: Gatekeeper and the Key Master.

00:50:05.447 --> 00:50:08.140
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't think that's what he's after.

00:50:09.827 --> 00:50:12.687
LIAM: Well, I think we really have

00:50:12.687 --> 00:50:17.327
two options, with many different variations,

00:50:17.327 --> 00:50:21.452
but they are, slaughter them now.

00:50:23.077 --> 00:50:24.640
Or follow this road to the end.

00:50:27.447 --> 00:50:30.297
Because we either want to stop them

00:50:30.297 --> 00:50:34.027
from achieving whatever it is they're trying to do.

00:50:34.027 --> 00:50:35.997
No questions asked.

00:50:35.997 --> 00:50:38.897
Stop the end of the world or whatever we think this means.

00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:43.060
Or we are curious.

00:50:44.537 --> 00:50:46.157
LAURA: I'm not curious.

00:50:46.157 --> 00:50:47.350
I'm not curious.

00:50:48.207 --> 00:50:51.317
I know I don't want to see what they can do.

00:50:51.317 --> 00:50:52.957
I don't want it.

00:50:52.957 --> 00:50:54.460
But...

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.303
I also kind of like him.

00:50:57.247 --> 00:50:58.987
I know he's a bad guy.

00:51:01.047 --> 00:51:03.757
But it almost feels like if we say

00:51:03.757 --> 00:51:05.747
the right order of codewords

00:51:05.747 --> 00:51:08.414
then we can turn them back into Molly, you know?

00:51:09.847 --> 00:51:13.767
LIAM: Well, that is one vote or argument

00:51:13.767 --> 00:51:15.830
for following this to the end, because,

00:51:16.817 --> 00:51:19.767
stop them now, that's not really part of the equation.

00:51:19.767 --> 00:51:23.407
But even if we walk towards this big question mark,

00:51:23.407 --> 00:51:26.035
there is a chance of that.

00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:30.877
MARISHA: You mentioned saving somebody.

00:51:30.877 --> 00:51:32.810
TALIESIN: Hmm. I did.

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.044
MARISHA: Talking about him?

00:51:35.044 --> 00:51:35.877
TALIESIN: Of course.

00:51:35.877 --> 00:51:37.460
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.968
SAM: Oh, I thought you meant me!

00:51:39.837 --> 00:51:41.030
TALIESIN: No, you're fine.

00:51:42.157 --> 00:51:43.770
SAM: Yeah, I am.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.214
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:51:46.447 --> 00:51:47.847
TALIESIN: Anything from your people?

00:51:50.243 --> 00:51:51.487
MARISHA: The last time I checked in with them

00:51:51.487 --> 00:51:53.154
was when we got the details I think

00:51:53.154 --> 00:51:56.541
about the root words of Somnovem and whatnot.

00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:58.647
I don't think I have any lingering threads there, do I?

00:51:58.647 --> 00:52:00.447
Do I, DM, with the codewords?

00:52:00.447 --> 00:52:03.977
MATT: They're continuing to look and research into it, but.

00:52:03.977 --> 00:52:06.337
LIAM: No dangling participles?

00:52:06.337 --> 00:52:07.607
MARISHA: Check in with them maybe in the morning

00:52:07.607 --> 00:52:11.097
or maybe tomorrow night if Jester has a few spells left.

00:52:11.097 --> 00:52:12.742
TALIESIN: Actually, we could burn them now if we--

00:52:12.742 --> 00:52:14.973
LAURA: I mean, yeah, I can check in tonight.

00:52:14.973 --> 00:52:16.857
I can't remember if we checked in this morning or not,

00:52:16.857 --> 00:52:18.407
but there could be, you know,

00:52:18.407 --> 00:52:20.607
a lot more information in 12 hours.

00:52:20.607 --> 00:52:21.787
MARISHA: I'm trying to remember.

00:52:21.787 --> 00:52:23.340
I think it's been a few days.

00:52:24.254 --> 00:52:26.926
TALIESIN: Maybe stress the urgency.

00:52:26.926 --> 00:52:28.287
LAURA: Do you remember who I asked?

00:52:28.287 --> 00:52:29.917
Who I checked in with?

00:52:29.917 --> 00:52:31.637
MARISHA: It was...

00:52:33.907 --> 00:52:37.779
Head honcho, Yudala Fon.

00:52:37.779 --> 00:52:39.937
LAURA: Yudala Fon!
MARISHA: ♪ Yudala Fon! ♪

00:52:39.937 --> 00:52:41.837
LAURA: I wrote it down, too!

00:52:41.837 --> 00:52:44.523
I'm going to send a message to Yudala Fon.

00:52:44.523 --> 00:52:46.167
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:52:46.167 --> 00:52:47.387
LAURA: Hey, Yudala.

00:52:47.387 --> 00:52:49.883
Did you find anything else about all this stuff

00:52:49.883 --> 00:52:51.987
that we asked you to search for?

00:52:51.987 --> 00:52:54.379
I'm with Beau, by the way.

00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:56.703
TRAVIS: You have six words left.
MARISHA: Tell her I'm waving.

00:52:56.703 --> 00:52:58.382
TRAVIS: That's gross.
MARISHA: Tell her I'm waving!

00:52:58.382 --> 00:52:59.997
MATT: Tell them.
LAURA: Beau's waving!

00:52:59.997 --> 00:53:00.830
MATT: Them.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:02.527
LAURA: Tell them--
MARISHA: Tell them I'm waving.

00:53:02.527 --> 00:53:05.810
LAURA: Beau's waving and...

00:53:07.377 --> 00:53:08.390
she misses you!

00:53:11.378 --> 00:53:13.667
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:53:13.667 --> 00:53:16.042
MATT: (as Yudala) "We are looking into it.

00:53:16.042 --> 00:53:17.650
"There has been

00:53:18.957 --> 00:53:22.573
"some information on Aeor.

00:53:24.087 --> 00:53:25.717
"A longer conversation."

00:53:25.717 --> 00:53:27.025
LAURA: Oh, come on!

00:53:28.347 --> 00:53:30.296
MATT: Come by and we can share.

00:53:30.296 --> 00:53:32.467
(groaning)

00:53:32.467 --> 00:53:33.809
LAURA: You kidding me?
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:34.642
Ooh.

00:53:36.107 --> 00:53:38.833
MARISHA: Oh no!

00:53:38.833 --> 00:53:40.187
Oh no!

00:53:40.187 --> 00:53:41.197
TRAVIS: Can't put this in writing.
SAM: It's fine.

00:53:41.197 --> 00:53:42.537
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:53:42.537 --> 00:53:44.427
SAM: It's fine, Beau can go back

00:53:44.427 --> 00:53:46.667
and we'll just keep going with Nonagon.

00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:48.597
MARISHA: And then I get back how?

00:53:48.597 --> 00:53:52.417
SAM: Well, if the information is that good,

00:53:52.417 --> 00:53:53.787
you'll know how to get back.

00:53:53.787 --> 00:53:55.497
TRAVIS: Come back and we can share...

00:53:55.497 --> 00:53:56.617
TALIESIN: That doesn't make any sense.

00:53:56.617 --> 00:53:58.529
SAM: No, it doesn't.
(laughter)

00:53:58.529 --> 00:54:01.017
LIAM: You're not jumping back from that far away.

00:54:01.017 --> 00:54:05.177
MARISHA: I punch things, I cannot teleport.

00:54:05.177 --> 00:54:07.677
LIAM: Even with help, though, it's a little precarious.

00:54:08.607 --> 00:54:10.797
LAURA: You could come back cut in half.

00:54:10.797 --> 00:54:13.900
You could come back with a unicorn horn!

00:54:14.757 --> 00:54:15.867
MARISHA: Which would be awesome.

00:54:15.867 --> 00:54:16.721
LAURA: Which would be really cool.

00:54:16.721 --> 00:54:19.904
Think about the damage you could do, Beau.
SAM: Beau with a unicorn horn would be good.

00:54:20.773 --> 00:54:23.097
LAURA: That would be really great.

00:54:23.097 --> 00:54:25.777
TALIESIN: Not that-- if it comes to it, we always have

00:54:25.777 --> 00:54:27.856
the emergency ripcord.

00:54:27.856 --> 00:54:28.689
LAURA: Yeah.

00:54:30.016 --> 00:54:31.222
TRAVIS: What is that again?
LAURA: Preparing it every day.

00:54:31.222 --> 00:54:32.055
TRAVIS: What's the emergency ripcord?

00:54:32.055 --> 00:54:33.287
TALIESIN: I'm not saying it out loud.

00:54:33.287 --> 00:54:34.120
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:34.957 --> 00:54:36.467
You're right, I should remember.

00:54:36.467 --> 00:54:37.327
SAM: Yeah, you know.

00:54:37.327 --> 00:54:38.817
You always-- you never forget.

00:54:38.817 --> 00:54:40.281
TRAVIS: Nope, I got it right up here in my dome.

00:54:40.281 --> 00:54:42.107
LAURA: He's like an elephant.

00:54:42.107 --> 00:54:44.617
MARISHA: Larger convo, please come by.

00:54:44.617 --> 00:54:48.197
LIAM: It's been a "whole week" since we played.

00:54:48.197 --> 00:54:49.294
And I'm trying to remember.

00:54:49.294 --> 00:54:52.337
(laughter)

00:54:52.337 --> 00:54:54.324
SAM: Every Thursday!
LIAM: Every Thursday.

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:57.766
I'm trying to remember-- such a long week, seriously.

00:54:59.447 --> 00:55:01.717
SAM: Epic growth hormone. (laughs)

00:55:01.717 --> 00:55:05.492
LIAM: Wasn't there-- was there--?
(laughter)

00:55:06.347 --> 00:55:08.667
Wasn't there armor that I had not identified yet?

00:55:08.667 --> 00:55:13.167
I identified that rod, but there was magic armor.

00:55:13.167 --> 00:55:14.707
LAURA: The rod...

00:55:14.707 --> 00:55:15.997
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I would love that.
TRAVIS: I wish I'd stayed away from

00:55:15.997 --> 00:55:17.137
that elk antler, man.

00:55:17.137 --> 00:55:19.950
TALIESIN: I would love to clean up any of that

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:20.965
that we need to do.

00:55:20.965 --> 00:55:22.209
LAURA: I can't remember what the rod did.

00:55:22.209 --> 00:55:24.497
It was just a platinum rod, right?

00:55:24.497 --> 00:55:25.330
It wasn't even, like--

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:26.397
LIAM: Well, the rod was identified.

00:55:26.397 --> 00:55:28.260
It was a Rod of Fear?

00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:30.644
I think.

00:55:30.644 --> 00:55:31.802
MATT: I have to remember.

00:55:31.802 --> 00:55:34.276
It's been a long week.
LIAM: But there was leather armor.

00:55:35.297 --> 00:55:36.657
SAM: What was this? What?

00:55:36.657 --> 00:55:39.380
LIAM: In our journey a week ago,

00:55:40.647 --> 00:55:42.160
there was leather armor.

00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:45.402
LAURA: A Wand of Fear. I do have that.

00:55:45.402 --> 00:55:46.235
LIAM: There was a Rod of Fear

00:55:46.235 --> 00:55:48.587
with the property of a Wand of Fear.

00:55:48.587 --> 00:55:50.197
LAURA: Okay.

00:55:50.197 --> 00:55:51.457
SAM: The leather armor, you have it?

00:55:51.457 --> 00:55:52.587
Did you identify it?

00:55:52.587 --> 00:55:53.687
LIAM: No, I don't think I did.

00:55:53.687 --> 00:55:54.757
And I don't know who's in possession,

00:55:54.757 --> 00:55:57.447
I mean, we are in possession of magic armor, but I can't.

00:55:57.447 --> 00:55:58.987
SAM: Oh wait, wait.

00:55:58.987 --> 00:56:00.512
I wrote down something--
LIAM: Or maybe we did identify

00:56:00.512 --> 00:56:01.345
and I just don't remember,

00:56:01.345 --> 00:56:03.557
but it's bouncing around my head.

00:56:03.557 --> 00:56:05.247
SAM: I wrote down-- wait, what is this?

00:56:05.247 --> 00:56:06.157
I have...

00:56:09.747 --> 00:56:12.487
Armor from Zana. Who's Zana?

00:56:12.487 --> 00:56:15.677
MATT: Yeah, Zana was the leader of the team

00:56:15.677 --> 00:56:17.977
that had head into the last ruins

00:56:17.977 --> 00:56:18.817
that you found the corpse of.

00:56:18.817 --> 00:56:20.317
LAURA: Oh! So we haven't identified that armor yet.

00:56:20.317 --> 00:56:21.937
SAM: Is that the armor that you're talking about?

00:56:21.937 --> 00:56:23.947
LAURA: But it-- wait, but it wasn't magical.

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.177
LIAM: There was some, I thought.

00:56:25.177 --> 00:56:27.914
Maybe I'm misremembering, 'cause again, it's been a week.

00:56:27.914 --> 00:56:30.177
MATT: Indeed, I'm looking that up right now.

00:56:30.177 --> 00:56:31.028
TALIESIN: Hmm.

00:56:31.028 --> 00:56:31.861
MATT: I'm going to go through my old notes.

00:56:31.861 --> 00:56:32.907
LAURA: I bet Dani knows.

00:56:32.907 --> 00:56:35.327
MARISHA: I was going to say, yeah, Slack Dani.

00:56:35.327 --> 00:56:37.158
SAM: If only we had a Dani.

00:56:40.307 --> 00:56:41.804
MARISHA: Is someone Slacking Dani?

00:56:41.804 --> 00:56:43.923
(laughter)

00:56:43.923 --> 00:56:46.817
LIAM: I would've remembered, though,
because we Detect Magic-ed everything

00:56:46.817 --> 00:56:48.389
and I had, like--

00:56:48.389 --> 00:56:49.850
MATT: No, no, I believe you.
LIAM: I had magic in my head.

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:51.557
I'm just going back to the...

00:56:51.557 --> 00:56:53.147
LIAM: Basically I'm asking--
MATT: Ah, yes.

00:56:53.147 --> 00:56:54.967
Okay, yes, I have it.

00:56:54.967 --> 00:56:55.800
So, would you like to--?

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.497
LIAM: Yes, I'll take 10 minutes to--

00:56:57.497 --> 00:56:59.417
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: -- Identify.

00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:02.977
MATT: It is a set of studded leather armor

00:57:02.977 --> 00:57:07.977
that has a fairly strong defensive property.

00:57:08.417 --> 00:57:11.507
An Abjuration-based protective property enchanted to it.

00:57:11.507 --> 00:57:13.437
The equivalent to what would be

00:57:13.437 --> 00:57:14.767
plus two studded leather armor.

00:57:14.767 --> 00:57:15.600
LAURA: Whoa!
LIAM: Okay.

00:57:17.157 --> 00:57:19.197
That's good, not for me, but.

00:57:19.197 --> 00:57:20.857
MARISHA: That is really good.

00:57:20.857 --> 00:57:21.690
SAM: I can wear that.

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:23.047
LIAM: Yes, you can.

00:57:23.047 --> 00:57:23.990
LAURA: Who has low AC?

00:57:25.427 --> 00:57:26.347
They can wear it.

00:57:26.347 --> 00:57:28.184
SAM: We're all pretty powerful at this point.

00:57:28.184 --> 00:57:29.287
LAURA: Sure, but who's got the lowest?

00:57:29.287 --> 00:57:30.147
TRAVIS: What's your AC?

00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:31.387
TALIESIN: It's probably not--
SAM: 18.

00:57:31.387 --> 00:57:34.637
TALIESIN: You probably don't need to sit with it, right?

00:57:34.637 --> 00:57:35.470
I imagine.

00:57:36.567 --> 00:57:38.947
LIAM: Is it attunable? Or none?

00:57:38.947 --> 00:57:39.780
MATT: It's attuned.

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.037
LIAM: Attuned? Okay.

00:57:41.037 --> 00:57:42.055
TALIESIN: Oh, well.

00:57:46.224 --> 00:57:47.467
LIAM: Well, there it is.

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.077
MATT: So.

00:57:52.077 --> 00:57:53.057
Any other business for the evening

00:57:53.057 --> 00:57:54.207
or do you wish to rest?

00:57:55.374 --> 00:57:56.532
LAURA: Umm...

00:57:59.662 --> 00:58:00.706
SAM: Let's rest, let's rest.

00:58:00.706 --> 00:58:02.372
TRAVIS: Yeah, rest up.
SAM: We've got stuff to do tomorrow.

00:58:02.372 --> 00:58:03.837
TRAVIS: Just 'cause we were taking a vote,

00:58:03.837 --> 00:58:05.427
I vote, we slaughter them now.

00:58:05.427 --> 00:58:07.644
Just to make at least one in the other column.

00:58:07.644 --> 00:58:10.044
Everyone else wants to see it out, yes?

00:58:10.044 --> 00:58:11.860
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:58:13.243 --> 00:58:14.076
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:58:15.153 --> 00:58:16.267
MARISHA: Ah...

00:58:16.267 --> 00:58:17.717
MATT: Aww, so you're the only one?

00:58:18.597 --> 00:58:19.737
SAM: I want to see where this goes.

00:58:19.737 --> 00:58:20.687
LAURA: I mean...

00:58:21.637 --> 00:58:22.717
I mean...

00:58:25.527 --> 00:58:26.997
TALIESIN: I like to give more opportunities

00:58:26.997 --> 00:58:28.130
for things to go well.

00:58:29.227 --> 00:58:31.112
SAM: Ah, I'm the opposite.

00:58:32.147 --> 00:58:35.040
I want Nonagon to be <i>my</i> rabies.

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.129
(laughter)

00:58:38.129 --> 00:58:39.754
LIAM: All right, My Chemical Romance.

00:58:42.905 --> 00:58:44.247
LAURA: What do you think?
ASHLEY: I'm curious.

00:58:44.247 --> 00:58:45.317
LAURA: Yeah?
SAM: Yeah?

00:58:45.317 --> 00:58:46.150
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:58:47.761 --> 00:58:50.830
I want to see where it goes.

00:58:51.877 --> 00:58:52.710
And also,

00:58:53.957 --> 00:58:55.490
I feel like we can save him.

00:58:56.357 --> 00:58:59.197
I don't know if that's very naive of me to think that.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.187
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

00:59:04.187 --> 00:59:05.557
SAM: It's okay to have hope.

00:59:05.557 --> 00:59:07.007
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:59:07.007 --> 00:59:07.857
ASHLEY: Is it?
TRAVIS: Then we rest.

00:59:07.857 --> 00:59:08.690
SAM: Yeah.

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.497
MARISHA: It's tough, it's

00:59:11.747 --> 00:59:14.780
easier to hate somebody the less you know about them.

00:59:18.157 --> 00:59:19.047
TRAVIS: Facts.

00:59:19.047 --> 00:59:20.297
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:59:20.297 --> 00:59:21.477
LIAM: You want to fax somebody?

00:59:21.477 --> 00:59:22.310
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:25.117
SAM: All right.
MARISHA: All right, let's go to bed.

00:59:25.117 --> 00:59:25.967
SAM: Goodnight, all.

00:59:27.057 --> 00:59:27.890
MATT: Okay.

00:59:30.157 --> 00:59:31.960
LIAM: Caleb rubs his temples.

00:59:33.317 --> 00:59:34.977
Slaps his face a couple of times,

00:59:34.977 --> 00:59:38.010
and just turns into a golden retriever.

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:41.277
SAM: That's new.
LIAM: And walks over

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:43.747
and just schlumps down next to Veth

00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:47.640
and just goes (sighs) on her feet.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.675
SAM: Stinky dog breath!
LIAM: With his chin on her feet.

00:59:49.675 --> 00:59:50.727
MATT: Aww.

00:59:50.727 --> 00:59:52.414
ASHLEY: I have to give him some scritches.

00:59:52.414 --> 00:59:54.223
SAM: Hello, hello.

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:55.657
Hello!

00:59:55.657 --> 00:59:57.260
ASHLEY: I go over and I give him some.

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.911
SAM: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Oh, scritch!

00:59:58.911 --> 01:00:01.127
SAM: We'll co-scritch.

01:00:01.127 --> 01:00:03.229
MATT: Co-scritch! Perfect.

01:00:06.077 --> 01:00:08.993
LAURA: Don't lay on your back, Caleb, that's weird!

01:00:09.986 --> 01:00:11.153
SAM: He's presenting himself!

01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:12.190
LAURA: Oh no!

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:15.228
SAM: He's presenting himself!
LAURA: Caleb's flashing everyone.

01:00:15.228 --> 01:00:16.747
MATT: It's super great, because about an hour later

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:19.727
while sleeping he just suddenly (whooshes) back into Caleb.

01:00:19.727 --> 01:00:22.759
(laughter)
TALIESIN: (grunts)

01:00:22.759 --> 01:00:23.859
LAURA: Butt to face.

01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:26.547
LIAM: Continues to sleep on Veth's ankles.

01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:28.407
MATT: Fair enough.
TRAVIS: Sleeping foot.

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:31.577
MATT: The Tomb Takers have watch up and about.

01:00:31.577 --> 01:00:32.667
If any of you would like take watch

01:00:32.667 --> 01:00:34.077
or if you're trusting them to keep watch,

01:00:34.077 --> 01:00:34.910
that's up to you.
LAURA: Oh yeah,

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:35.743
we should keep watch.

01:00:35.743 --> 01:00:37.347
ASHLEY: I'll take first watch.

01:00:37.347 --> 01:00:39.681
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a perception check, Yasha.

01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:40.514
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:00:47.287 --> 01:00:50.327
That would be 21.

01:00:50.327 --> 01:00:51.397
MATT: Nice.

01:00:51.397 --> 01:00:53.337
You do see on the peripheral,

01:00:53.337 --> 01:00:57.267
it looks like some large shapes

01:00:57.267 --> 01:00:59.667
begin to cross somewhat near.

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:02.947
You can't quite make out what they are

01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:03.940
but you can see

01:01:05.881 --> 01:01:09.017
Zoran and Tyffial end up leaving the fire

01:01:09.017 --> 01:01:10.310
and going off after it.

01:01:12.337 --> 01:01:15.805
You then hear these muffled sounds in the distance,

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:18.122
this like (trumpets),

01:01:18.122 --> 01:01:21.447
these elephant-like sounds.

01:01:21.447 --> 01:01:23.824
And then you hear (thundering footsteps).

01:01:23.824 --> 01:01:26.627
And you-- they must've scared off

01:01:26.627 --> 01:01:28.890
whatever was wandering too close by.

01:01:29.877 --> 01:01:32.530
Then they return to their campsite.

01:01:33.977 --> 01:01:35.577
But beyond that, no other issue.

01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:38.187
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:01:38.187 --> 01:01:39.020
MATT: Second watch?

01:01:40.527 --> 01:01:41.667
LAURA: Oh!
TALIESIN: Oh, well, there we are.

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:43.667
MATT: All right, two of you, perception check.

01:01:48.689 --> 01:01:49.522
TALIESIN: 19.

01:01:50.467 --> 01:01:52.359
LAURA: That's probably better than me.

01:01:58.777 --> 01:02:01.487
Yes, 17.
TRAVIS: Her dice are fucking absurd.

01:02:01.487 --> 01:02:02.320
MATT: Okay.

01:02:03.357 --> 01:02:06.349
Relatively uneventful, though the snow does pick up a bit

01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:07.917
through the night and begin to gather on the dome,

01:02:07.917 --> 01:02:11.837
which begins to clear out visibility quite a bit.

01:02:11.837 --> 01:02:14.767
As it begins to enclose the dome in the soft snowfall.

01:02:14.767 --> 01:02:17.619
Kind of glance over, you can see the faint embers

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:19.197
that are the only point of light

01:02:19.197 --> 01:02:23.477
in the lightless, black sky and ground around you.

01:02:23.477 --> 01:02:25.737
Other than just the glance of Lucien just sitting there,

01:02:25.737 --> 01:02:27.607
looking across in your direction,

01:02:27.607 --> 01:02:28.535
keeping watch.
LAURA: Still staring?

01:02:28.535 --> 01:02:29.868
MATT: Still staring.

01:02:31.837 --> 01:02:32.670
But uneventful.

01:02:33.587 --> 01:02:34.950
Third and final watch, who's taking it?

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:36.335
LIAM: (yawns) Yeah, okay.

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:37.336
MATT: All right, Caleb, go ahead and roll

01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:38.687
a perception check for me.

01:02:41.313 --> 01:02:43.437
LIAM: Can Frumpkin can help me?

01:02:43.437 --> 01:02:45.307
LAURA: It never goes well!
MATT: Sure.

01:02:45.307 --> 01:02:46.590
LIAM: But it's a help for me.

01:02:48.117 --> 01:02:49.139
Oh, natural 20.

01:02:49.139 --> 01:02:50.870
ALL: Hey!
MATT: Nice, nice.

01:02:53.477 --> 01:02:55.497
The dome is covered in snow.

01:02:55.497 --> 01:02:58.057
So you would have to reach out and

01:02:58.057 --> 01:03:01.805
clear it off a bit to get a useful perspective.
LIAM: Oh, well, this is how Frumpkin helps me.

01:03:01.805 --> 01:03:04.067
MATT: There you go.
LIAM: I peris-cat him out.

01:03:04.067 --> 01:03:05.655
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: Periscat?

01:03:05.655 --> 01:03:06.770
MATT: Peris-cat?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:07.980
That's a whole other show.
MATT: I don't think that means

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.223
what you think it means.

01:03:09.223 --> 01:03:10.940
(laughter)

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.773
SAM: (blows raspberry)

01:03:11.773 --> 01:03:14.051
LIAM: Caleb does a handstand and...

01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:16.468
(laughter)

01:03:17.385 --> 01:03:18.797
LIAM: Thar she blows!

01:03:18.797 --> 01:03:19.630
MATT: Okay.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.717
TALIESIN: The more I think about it--

01:03:20.717 --> 01:03:23.135
TRAVIS: Peris-cat.
MATT: Tub Caleb? No.

01:03:23.135 --> 01:03:24.260
(groaning)

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.717
LIAM: No!
SAM: Oh!

01:03:25.717 --> 01:03:26.886
MATT: Anyway, anyway.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:27.799
Oh, no.

01:03:27.799 --> 01:03:29.507
LAURA: Oh, that's--
MATT: No! Anyway.

01:03:29.507 --> 01:03:32.240
You hold Frumpkin beyond the dome.

01:03:33.447 --> 01:03:35.127
LIAM: Kill us now, Nonagon!

01:03:35.127 --> 01:03:36.007
MATT: Please.

01:03:36.007 --> 01:03:36.923
It's the only way it can go now.

01:03:36.923 --> 01:03:39.506
TRAVIS: I told you we should've killed him!

01:03:39.506 --> 01:03:40.906
MATT: But you didn't believe me!

01:03:42.295 --> 01:03:43.257
TALIESIN: I'm not doing it.

01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:44.599
MATT: Keeping an eye out there.

01:03:46.534 --> 01:03:48.520
Frumpkin shivers in your grasp.

01:03:49.527 --> 01:03:51.187
Looking around, left to right,

01:03:51.187 --> 01:03:54.217
no sign of anything dangerous in the peripheral.

01:03:54.217 --> 01:03:55.447
Uneventful evening.

01:03:59.317 --> 01:04:02.337
Eventually, as the light begins to come to,

01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:06.217
it is not the clear sunrise you've met a few times out here.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.867
It is a light snow and a gray sky above.

01:04:08.867 --> 01:04:12.457
But nevertheless, the day does warm to a degree.

01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:14.857
And eventually, after pushing off some of the snow

01:04:14.857 --> 01:04:17.887
and the dome coming down and dropping the rest of it

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:21.197
around you in this soft pile of fresh powder,

01:04:21.197 --> 01:04:23.127
you glance over and can see the flames

01:04:23.127 --> 01:04:25.347
have kicked up over where the Tomb Takers are

01:04:25.347 --> 01:04:28.037
as they are preparing themselves for the day,

01:04:28.037 --> 01:04:30.257
having a meal and glancing over

01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:33.877
to notice your being awake as well.

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.300
What would you like to do?

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.561
TALIESIN: Confirm my long rest.

01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:40.060
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, thank you.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:40.893
MATT: Do that.

01:04:40.893 --> 01:04:42.347
LAURA: We lose our exhaustion point?

01:04:43.407 --> 01:04:44.815
Had we already lost that?
MATT: I think you'd already lost that.

01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:45.648
LAURA: Okay.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.507
TALIESIN: Get everything else back.

01:04:47.507 --> 01:04:49.917
SAM: I don't know that I can use that armor, guys.

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:53.980
I mean, if I do, I will sacrifice some stealth capability.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:57.965
SAM: Nice to meet you.
LAURA: Nice to meet you!

01:04:57.965 --> 01:04:59.605
(laughter)

01:04:59.605 --> 01:05:01.697
TRAVIS: Who else has low AC? I'm 17.

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:04.356
LAURA: Whoa! Well, but I thought you had special armor.

01:05:04.356 --> 01:05:07.488
TRAVIS: I have Mariner's Armor, which is not applicable

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:08.878
when we're not on water.
SAM: Not the armor of Agath--

01:05:08.878 --> 01:05:10.087
Agatha Christie?

01:05:10.087 --> 01:05:11.954
TRAVIS: Mm-mm. No.
MARISHA: That's a spell.

01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:13.937
LAURA: Oh, well, Fjord could wear it, then.

01:05:13.937 --> 01:05:16.174
That's pretty low.

01:05:16.174 --> 01:05:18.097
TRAVIS: Anybody else have low AC?

01:05:18.097 --> 01:05:20.080
MARISHA: I can't wear leather.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.044
TRAVIS: You can't wear leather?

01:05:21.044 --> 01:05:23.357
LAURA: That's unfortunate. Leather would look good on you.

01:05:23.357 --> 01:05:25.097
MARISHA: I use my abs as my armor.

01:05:25.097 --> 01:05:28.007
TRAVIS: Okay. What about pleather? Can you wear pleather?

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:29.153
MARISHA: On Saturday nights.

01:05:29.153 --> 01:05:30.492
(laughter)

01:05:30.492 --> 01:05:32.747
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take it. Anybody else? Really, no?

01:05:32.747 --> 01:05:35.247
SAM: I could use it, but I would have to--

01:05:35.247 --> 01:05:36.437
TRAVIS: Give up stealthy stuff?

01:05:36.437 --> 01:05:37.630
SAM: Give up this dagger.

01:05:38.687 --> 01:05:41.218
TRAVIS: Is that a problem?
SAM: And I won't do that.

01:05:43.767 --> 01:05:45.157
Anyway, let's go have a day!

01:05:45.157 --> 01:05:47.033
(laughter)

01:05:47.033 --> 01:05:48.341
LAURA: DId we notice a crazy look

01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:49.999
in Veth's eye when she said it?

01:05:49.999 --> 01:05:50.982
MATT: You can make an insight check.

01:05:50.982 --> 01:05:51.937
LAURA: Okay.

01:05:51.937 --> 01:05:53.245
TALIESIN: Genuinely no different than

01:05:53.245 --> 01:05:54.931
the normal crazy look in Veth's eye.

01:05:54.931 --> 01:05:56.197
MATT: I mean, you're not wrong.

01:05:56.197 --> 01:05:57.087
LIAM: Little bit of Nott in there.

01:05:57.087 --> 01:05:58.645
LAURA: Oh, nope, natural one.

01:05:58.645 --> 01:06:01.717
MATT: Not at all. Not at all.
LAURA: Nope, nope.

01:06:01.717 --> 01:06:02.772
MATT: Yeah,

01:06:02.772 --> 01:06:03.605
if nobody else wants it, you can take it.

01:06:03.605 --> 01:06:04.639
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll take it.

01:06:04.639 --> 01:06:06.564
I'll put it on, but I won't attune to it just yet.
LIAM: Get that studded leather armor, stud.

01:06:06.564 --> 01:06:07.887
MATT: Okay.

01:06:07.887 --> 01:06:09.097
All right.

01:06:09.097 --> 01:06:10.437
As you guys are gathering your things

01:06:10.437 --> 01:06:14.051
and getting your meals situated.

01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:16.527
SAM: Liam!
LAURA: Armor, plus two.

01:06:16.527 --> 01:06:17.470
MATT: You notice

01:06:18.927 --> 01:06:20.927
Lucien begins to approach

01:06:20.927 --> 01:06:23.837
as they finish with the fire in the other camp.

01:06:23.837 --> 01:06:26.197
Steps up, heavy coat on, looks like he's

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:29.027
all smiles this morning.

01:06:32.777 --> 01:06:33.917
"Before we finish breakfast,

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:36.660
"since we had a bit of a conversation the other day,

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:42.583
"sure, I'd be curious."

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:43.737
He pulls on the cloak and pulls out

01:06:43.737 --> 01:06:47.187
what you see to be the collection of papers

01:06:47.187 --> 01:06:50.945
and haphazard binding on the tome

01:06:50.945 --> 01:06:54.011
that you saw taken

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:56.594
from the interior of Vess DeRogna's chambers.

01:06:56.594 --> 01:06:58.727
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that book.

01:07:00.877 --> 01:07:02.297
MATT: Kind of looking over

01:07:03.407 --> 01:07:05.000
to, holding it out.

01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:09.077
"I assume someone wants to give it a shot?"

01:07:09.077 --> 01:07:10.517
LIAM: Absolutely.

01:07:10.517 --> 01:07:13.137
LAURA: He's the one that understands that sort of stuff.

01:07:13.137 --> 01:07:14.237
MATT: "I certainly hope so.

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:16.024
"Here."

01:07:16.024 --> 01:07:17.196
LIAM: Okay.

01:07:17.196 --> 01:07:18.807
MARISHA: I scooch over to Caleb.

01:07:18.807 --> 01:07:19.697
LIAM: Yeah, come have a seat.

01:07:19.697 --> 01:07:20.777
MATT: So the two of you? Okay.

01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:22.957
LIAM: I roll out a wide piece of leather

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.437
so it doesn't get snow on it and I set it down and--

01:07:25.437 --> 01:07:26.637
TALIESIN: Resistance.

01:07:26.637 --> 01:07:27.577
LIAM: Thank you.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:32.367
Reach into my components and I pull out a black pearl.

01:07:32.367 --> 01:07:33.677
No.

01:07:33.677 --> 01:07:35.251
Pull out a white pearl.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.394
TALIESIN: Guidance?

01:07:36.394 --> 01:07:38.967
LIAM: And will cast Fortune's Favor on myself

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:41.547
and little geometric shapes spiral out.

01:07:41.547 --> 01:07:42.380
LAURA: I'm going to grab his shoulders

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:43.367
and give him a little back rub

01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:45.427
and say you can do this: Caleb, you got this!

01:07:45.427 --> 01:07:46.857
Guidance.

01:07:46.857 --> 01:07:47.690
LIAM: Okay.

01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:49.657
Okay.

01:07:49.657 --> 01:07:52.097
SAM: Was there some specific request?

01:07:52.097 --> 01:07:54.630
Or is it just a general knowledge?

01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:56.889
LAURA: I think it's going to be, like,

01:07:56.889 --> 01:07:57.927
seeing what he can decipher.

01:07:57.927 --> 01:07:58.760
MATT: For one thing.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.997
LIAM: Spend some time with it.

01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:04.877
MATT: The script, as you glance at it,

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:06.127
it makes no sense to you.

01:08:06.967 --> 01:08:08.307
LIAM: Oh, well that's easy.

01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:09.637
MATT: What languages do you-- oh.

01:08:09.637 --> 01:08:11.400
Actually, what languages do you both know?

01:08:13.127 --> 01:08:13.960
MARISHA: Hang on.
LIAM: Well.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.317
MARISHA: I think it's more up-to-date on my D&amp;D Beyond.

01:08:15.317 --> 01:08:17.287
LIAM: I'm going to cast Comprehend Languages.

01:08:17.287 --> 01:08:20.477
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: And I also have that fancy,

01:08:20.477 --> 01:08:21.531
monk--
LIAM: Read everything?

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.990
MARISHA: Read, the monk ability.
LIAM: Read all.

01:08:25.867 --> 01:08:27.130
MARISHA: Features and traits.

01:08:28.407 --> 01:08:29.747
Hang on, hang on.

01:08:29.747 --> 01:08:31.717
Hold, keep going.

01:08:31.717 --> 01:08:33.017
SAM: Hang on, but keep going.

01:08:35.467 --> 01:08:37.167
MARISHA: Tongue of the Sun and Moon,

01:08:37.167 --> 01:08:39.667
you can understand all spoken languages.

01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:40.737
MATT: Correct, so--
MARISHA: Any creature

01:08:40.737 --> 01:08:41.967
that can understand a language,

01:08:41.967 --> 01:08:44.522
can understand you, you can't--
MATT: So it's speaking, but not reading.

01:08:44.522 --> 01:08:45.605
MARISHA: And then...

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:48.707
My

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.869
languages are Common, Deep Speech, Dwarvish,

01:08:51.869 --> 01:08:53.897
Halfling, Undercommon.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:56.621
MATT: Oh, you can read it, it's Undercommon.

01:08:56.621 --> 01:08:59.162
TRAVIS: Oh! What's up?!
LAURA: Hey!

01:08:59.162 --> 01:09:01.923
LIAM: It's written in GWAR.
TRAVIS: ♪ Additional languages! ♪

01:09:01.923 --> 01:09:03.914
MARISHA: Huh?
LIAM: I said it's written in GWAR.

01:09:03.914 --> 01:09:05.207
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.631
MATT: You cast?

01:09:06.631 --> 01:09:08.407
LIAM: Comprehend.
MATT: Comprehend Languages.

01:09:08.407 --> 01:09:10.707
It's Undercommon, which you can read.

01:09:10.707 --> 01:09:13.677
You pick this up because of your training

01:09:13.677 --> 01:09:14.980
with the Cobalt Soul.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.937
MARISHA: Is it like a cant?

01:09:18.937 --> 01:09:20.297
MATT: It's written as a cipher,

01:09:20.297 --> 01:09:24.217
meaning the language is not a common language of the writer

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:28.957
and it is, the way it's written is different

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:33.957
from most Undercommon speakers, instinctually.

01:09:34.257 --> 01:09:37.137
So it is, you gather quickly that this

01:09:37.137 --> 01:09:38.490
is intended as a cipher.

01:09:40.798 --> 01:09:42.212
Now, the contents.

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:43.179
MARISHA: Okay.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.297
MATT: Begin abruptly.

01:09:44.297 --> 01:09:47.127
Like the early pages are no longer part of it.

01:09:47.127 --> 01:09:50.007
They read like brief passages about historical musings,

01:09:50.007 --> 01:09:52.117
piecing together elements of Aeor's history,

01:09:52.117 --> 01:09:56.257
mental notes over breakfast by a confounded arcanist.

01:09:56.257 --> 01:09:57.857
Questions they posit to themselves

01:09:57.857 --> 01:09:59.287
about where it might lie,

01:09:59.287 --> 01:10:00.737
what secrets made it so dangerous

01:10:00.737 --> 01:10:02.747
to call the ire of the gods down upon it

01:10:02.747 --> 01:10:04.477
at the height of the Calamity?

01:10:04.477 --> 01:10:06.417
Details of odd recovered relics

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:09.067
from around the Frigid Depths surrounding Eiselcross

01:10:09.067 --> 01:10:10.747
and the theories that they have

01:10:10.747 --> 01:10:14.607
that elements of Aeor might actually be found there.

01:10:14.607 --> 01:10:16.137
Half-finished sketches follow that

01:10:16.137 --> 01:10:17.860
of assumed Aeorian architecture.

01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:21.987
Discussions of the Convocation of Aeor,

01:10:21.987 --> 01:10:25.157
the committee of mages that governed the ancient city.

01:10:25.157 --> 01:10:26.717
Pontificating about their politics

01:10:26.717 --> 01:10:28.987
and whether they were indeed a unified people

01:10:28.987 --> 01:10:30.630
as some archivists suggest.

01:10:32.357 --> 01:10:35.317
The notes then continue, like a travel log.

01:10:35.317 --> 01:10:37.217
Making themselves the briefest of entries

01:10:37.217 --> 01:10:39.077
regarding their journey northward.

01:10:39.077 --> 01:10:39.987
Since they're not unlike

01:10:39.987 --> 01:10:41.547
the Nein's own journey through here,

01:10:41.547 --> 01:10:43.787
it discusses the harshness of the environment,

01:10:43.787 --> 01:10:45.507
the dangers that beset them.

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.627
There's no mention of Balenpost

01:10:47.627 --> 01:10:49.597
and no other societal handholds

01:10:49.597 --> 01:10:50.777
up here in the north, really.

01:10:50.777 --> 01:10:53.777
It's just desolate, uncharted tundra.

01:10:53.777 --> 01:10:56.587
And, honestly, a deadly mystery.

01:10:56.587 --> 01:10:59.187
There are numerous gripes about magic being unpredictable

01:10:59.187 --> 01:11:01.197
up in this space and numerous times

01:11:01.197 --> 01:11:05.107
and odd creatures that had to be avoided on this journey.

01:11:05.107 --> 01:11:07.627
Very much gives you the sense

01:11:07.627 --> 01:11:11.403
of an early explorer first coming to uncharted land.

01:11:12.747 --> 01:11:17.507
Eventually, the entries being to speak of a massive anomaly

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:20.297
that they came across, a patch of frost

01:11:20.297 --> 01:11:24.967
that's miles long, and it piques his curiosity.

01:11:24.967 --> 01:11:27.407
More entries beyond that briefly note his entrance

01:11:27.407 --> 01:11:31.590
to a subterranean labyrinth of corridors and structures.

01:11:32.647 --> 01:11:34.727
Sketches of door reliefs and archways

01:11:34.727 --> 01:11:36.880
and long dead bodies left frozen.

01:11:38.807 --> 01:11:41.577
One perfunctory entry speaks of an uncovered text,

01:11:41.577 --> 01:11:45.067
hurriedly scrawled before the death of its writer.

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:45.900
It reads,

01:11:46.967 --> 01:11:49.033
"The philosophers abandoned us.

01:11:50.217 --> 01:11:52.317
"The cursed, plotting dreamers

01:11:52.317 --> 01:11:54.627
"took their whole Ward with them.

01:11:54.627 --> 01:11:57.404
"Curse them. May they rot in--"

01:11:58.325 --> 01:11:59.367
and it ended there.

01:11:59.367 --> 01:12:00.667
LIAM: "May they rot in"?

01:12:00.667 --> 01:12:03.507
MATT: In, and ended there.

01:12:03.507 --> 01:12:05.167
The following entries muse out

01:12:05.167 --> 01:12:06.197
the meaning of this statement,

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:07.857
slowly exploring more of the ruin

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:10.900
and trying to piece together their goings on.

01:12:12.517 --> 01:12:14.907
Even further entries still speak of the sounds

01:12:14.907 --> 01:12:15.824
that worry the mage.

01:12:15.824 --> 01:12:19.137
"Things are living down in these halls," he says.

01:12:19.137 --> 01:12:21.220
He notes his need for caution.

01:12:22.277 --> 01:12:24.397
Eventually, an entry speaks of finding information

01:12:24.397 --> 01:12:26.267
about some of the Aeorian Wards.

01:12:26.267 --> 01:12:30.904
The Praesidis Ward, the Ars Ward.

01:12:30.904 --> 01:12:31.737
LAURA: (chuckles)

01:12:31.737 --> 01:12:33.913
MATT: Ars, A-R-S.

01:12:33.913 --> 01:12:35.557
MARISHA: Praes, Praes?

01:12:35.557 --> 01:12:38.992
MATT: P-R-A-E-S-I-D-I-S Ward.

01:12:38.992 --> 01:12:41.057
MARISHA: Praesidis. Ars Ward?

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:42.527
MATT: Ars Ward.

01:12:42.527 --> 01:12:46.667
And in particular, the Cognouza Ward.

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:48.707
A region organized by nine philosophers

01:12:48.707 --> 01:12:50.917
who were dedicated to the ideas of manifestation

01:12:50.917 --> 01:12:52.717
through dream and imagination

01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:55.267
with the conduit of arcana.

01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:57.047
Increasingly obsessed with the Astral Plane

01:12:57.047 --> 01:12:59.167
and many of its denizens being able to forge matter

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:01.907
from sheer will and idea alone,

01:13:01.907 --> 01:13:04.087
they were rumored to be plotting a succession--

01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:05.957
or secession from the Convocation,

01:13:05.957 --> 01:13:07.757
to abscond from the city

01:13:07.757 --> 01:13:09.797
to their beloved Plane of dreams and ash,

01:13:09.797 --> 01:13:13.387
as it said in some of the notes of other Aeorian denizens

01:13:13.387 --> 01:13:14.520
that seem to be

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:18.810
speaking down on these philosophers.

01:13:20.357 --> 01:13:22.297
The next entry seems to tremble with excitement

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.947
and discovery, as the mage intends

01:13:23.947 --> 01:13:25.717
to project himself into the Astral Plane

01:13:25.717 --> 01:13:27.787
and seek out any survivors who,

01:13:27.787 --> 01:13:29.787
based on his findings, may have escaped.

01:13:31.247 --> 01:13:32.080
Then,

01:13:33.587 --> 01:13:35.362
the book changes dramatically.

01:13:36.587 --> 01:13:39.687
The following pages are filled, top to bottom page

01:13:39.687 --> 01:13:42.027
with nonsense, deep scratches of ink

01:13:42.027 --> 01:13:44.527
and shapes and symbols that make no sense,

01:13:44.527 --> 01:13:47.397
just hash marks and scratches and designs

01:13:47.397 --> 01:13:49.247
that overlap and twist.

01:13:49.247 --> 01:13:54.237
It is just a mess of designs and nothing.

01:13:55.317 --> 01:13:59.317
They have no purpose or reason to them.

01:13:59.317 --> 01:14:00.207
There's no language.

01:14:00.207 --> 01:14:03.012
There's hints of texts, but it's not.

01:14:03.012 --> 01:14:05.157
And your spell can't focus, it's...

01:14:06.197 --> 01:14:09.147
It's not able to make out any language at all

01:14:09.147 --> 01:14:10.630
because it's not language.

01:14:11.887 --> 01:14:14.847
It's filled with nightmarish design

01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:16.477
and incredibly detailed patterns

01:14:16.477 --> 01:14:19.417
that catch your eye on a smaller and smaller scale.

01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:21.720
These fractals that almost draw you in, that--

01:14:23.337 --> 01:14:26.311
You catch yourself leaning into the pages a bit.

01:14:26.311 --> 01:14:29.207
And then pull back for a moment and blink.

01:14:29.207 --> 01:14:31.387
And for a second, you catch yourself wondering,

01:14:31.387 --> 01:14:32.357
like, how much time has passed?

01:14:32.357 --> 01:14:34.587
How long have you been looking at that page?

01:14:34.587 --> 01:14:35.937
Just at that point, Lucien,

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:38.097
closes the book and goes,

01:14:39.066 --> 01:14:40.800
"I think that's enough reading for now.

01:14:42.217 --> 01:14:43.050
"So.

01:14:45.997 --> 01:14:47.347
"What'd you think?"

01:14:49.665 --> 01:14:51.365
LIAM: Whet my appetite, why don't you?

01:14:56.831 --> 01:14:58.581
They seem a lot like

01:15:01.784 --> 01:15:04.507
the Cerberus Assembly of their time, but,

01:15:04.507 --> 01:15:06.368
better or worse.

01:15:08.127 --> 01:15:09.577
Depending how you look at it.

01:15:10.987 --> 01:15:12.737
LAURA: How long were they looking at it?

01:15:14.417 --> 01:15:15.777
MATT: They began to read through,

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.377
and then once they got to the strange scrawlings

01:15:17.377 --> 01:15:19.737
it was a page turn, a page turn,

01:15:19.737 --> 01:15:21.130
a page turn.

01:15:22.407 --> 01:15:24.697
And then they just stared at one page

01:15:24.697 --> 01:15:26.367
quietly for about five minutes.

01:15:26.367 --> 01:15:27.350
LAURA: Wow. Okay.

01:15:28.677 --> 01:15:32.597
MARISHA: You said his spell was having a hard time

01:15:32.597 --> 01:15:33.760
making sense of it?

01:15:34.787 --> 01:15:36.834
Just looking at it.

01:15:36.834 --> 01:15:39.467
LIAM: At a certain point,
it wasn't language anymore, it was...

01:15:39.467 --> 01:15:41.270
MATT: Yeah, once you got to
those pages, there was no language.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:45.653
It looked like a

01:15:45.653 --> 01:15:49.761
disturbed individual's attempt
to produce a nightmare on page,

01:15:49.761 --> 01:15:50.727
but then there was structure,

01:15:50.727 --> 01:15:53.947
there were things that looked like glyphs,

01:15:53.947 --> 01:15:55.587
but they were broken and

01:15:56.437 --> 01:15:58.297
absent of any reason.

01:15:58.297 --> 01:16:00.157
You saw patterns that

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:04.007
made no sense, but were also beautiful.

01:16:04.007 --> 01:16:05.657
There was math to it at times,

01:16:05.657 --> 01:16:08.257
but then it seemed to just scatter out into nothing.

01:16:08.257 --> 01:16:10.837
It was infuriating for a person who has spent their life

01:16:10.837 --> 01:16:13.437
studying structure and equation,

01:16:13.437 --> 01:16:17.939
and the ability to control the order of the world

01:16:17.939 --> 01:16:21.137
and the elements and focus them.

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:25.517
And you think back to it,

01:16:25.517 --> 01:16:27.330
even with your Keen Mind feat,

01:16:29.807 --> 01:16:31.997
and for the first time, oddly,

01:16:31.997 --> 01:16:35.781
you can really not recall the details

01:16:35.781 --> 01:16:37.612
of any of the pages you just looked at.

01:16:37.612 --> 01:16:38.445
SAM: Whoa.

01:16:38.445 --> 01:16:41.937
LIAM: Well, it's very much-- and I'm bumping Beauregard,

01:16:41.937 --> 01:16:43.487
I'm not even talking to Lucien.

01:16:44.997 --> 01:16:47.480
We're talking so much about dreams, this is--

01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:50.890
this is dreams on paper.

01:16:52.187 --> 01:16:53.020
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:56.107 --> 01:16:58.630
LIAM: This is your friends.

01:17:01.707 --> 01:17:04.360
Talking to the writer, in their way.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:10.377
And you are able to read or make something of this?

01:17:10.377 --> 01:17:11.250
MATT: "Not at first.

01:17:15.387 --> 01:17:18.787
"But if you make sense of any of it, please do let me know."

01:17:19.827 --> 01:17:23.607
MARISHA: Was I able to glean anything

01:17:23.607 --> 01:17:25.317
in terms of pattern recognition

01:17:25.317 --> 01:17:27.417
just for the short amount of time that I was looking at it?

01:17:27.417 --> 01:17:31.455
With my Expositor, Chaos Crew brain?

01:17:35.357 --> 01:17:37.190
MATT: Go ahead and make,

01:17:38.877 --> 01:17:40.617
both of you, an intelligence check for me,

01:17:40.617 --> 01:17:41.966
if you don't mind.
MARISHA: Just a straight?

01:17:41.966 --> 01:17:43.919
MATT: Just a straight intelligence check.
LAURA: You get Guidance on that one.

01:17:43.919 --> 01:17:46.619
TRAVIS: Is that why this dude doesn't sleep?
LAURA: Plus a d4.

01:17:50.027 --> 01:17:51.257
LIAM: What kind of roll is it?

01:17:51.257 --> 01:17:52.097
MATT: Intelligence check.

01:17:52.097 --> 01:17:54.347
Just roll and add your intelligence modifier.

01:17:55.577 --> 01:17:56.410
MARISHA: 19.

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:57.243
LIAM: 25.

01:18:01.057 --> 01:18:02.010
MATT: Not bad.

01:18:02.977 --> 01:18:03.810
Not bad.

01:18:10.697 --> 01:18:12.100
You can make out,

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:17.837
no language, some elements of structure, it seems.

01:18:17.837 --> 01:18:22.030
But through the sketchiness, through the chaos,

01:18:24.057 --> 01:18:24.950
once again,

01:18:26.427 --> 01:18:27.777
there are patterns of nine.

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:29.690
Patterns of nine.

01:18:30.697 --> 01:18:31.690
Patterns of nine.

01:18:34.737 --> 01:18:37.760
Just that continuous numerical sequence.

01:18:39.697 --> 01:18:41.077
In different ways.

01:18:41.077 --> 01:18:44.887
Sometimes it's just little detailed hatches

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.097
against a semicircle.

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:49.587
Sometimes, if you look at the page from a distance,

01:18:49.587 --> 01:18:52.147
there were elements around the border

01:18:52.147 --> 01:18:53.037
that if you counted them up.

01:18:53.037 --> 01:18:56.947
It was just an endless source of...

01:19:01.587 --> 01:19:04.990
chaos built upon a singular numerical sequence.

01:19:06.317 --> 01:19:09.967
But that was just one aspect you could glean

01:19:09.967 --> 01:19:12.410
from so much nothing.

01:19:15.297 --> 01:19:16.890
LIAM: It's them speaking through.

01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:21.147
Minor question, there were sketches and drawings

01:19:21.147 --> 01:19:23.737
of doorways and passages earlier in the book,

01:19:23.737 --> 01:19:28.367
do they bear resemblance to the strange halls

01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:31.237
that we have been exploring with Big Bebe?

01:19:31.237 --> 01:19:32.797
MATT: The early sketches, not so much.

01:19:32.797 --> 01:19:34.517
The ones at the beginning of the book

01:19:34.517 --> 01:19:37.577
were more conjecture by the writer.

01:19:37.577 --> 01:19:39.867
The ones that began to accompany

01:19:39.867 --> 01:19:43.667
the actual passage into this labyrinth

01:19:43.667 --> 01:19:45.767
begin to very much resemble

01:19:45.767 --> 01:19:47.576
some of the ruins that you've already been through.

01:19:47.576 --> 01:19:48.636
LIAM: Okay.

01:19:48.636 --> 01:19:49.469
Okay.

01:19:52.072 --> 01:19:54.537
MATT: And with that, Lucien glances back

01:19:54.537 --> 01:19:55.487
at the rest of you.

01:19:56.507 --> 01:19:57.340
"Well.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:00.307
"Think on it a bit.

01:20:00.307 --> 01:20:01.607
"We've got a bit of travel.

01:20:03.177 --> 01:20:04.677
"If perhaps you've got an idea,

01:20:06.587 --> 01:20:07.437
"come let me know."

01:20:08.419 --> 01:20:11.377
And he turns around and walks back to the Tomb Takers.

01:20:11.377 --> 01:20:12.637
They take the rest of their heavy packs

01:20:12.637 --> 01:20:13.780
onto their shoulders.

01:20:17.507 --> 01:20:19.617
They all head over to meet you guys.

01:20:19.617 --> 01:20:21.337
LAURA: I'm going to turn back to Beau and Caleb

01:20:21.337 --> 01:20:23.387
just before they, as they walk away

01:20:23.387 --> 01:20:25.890
and just say: Be careful with that book.

01:20:27.357 --> 01:20:29.117
That's what Lucien was looking at

01:20:29.117 --> 01:20:32.010
when he became the Nonagon.

01:20:32.917 --> 01:20:34.997
It's a pathway.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:37.414
He might be doing it on purpose, you know?

01:20:38.677 --> 01:20:39.510
MARISHA: Yes.

01:20:42.767 --> 01:20:43.810
Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:20:46.747 --> 01:20:50.193
SAM: You're still you, right, Caleb?

01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:51.526
LIAM: (monster noises)

01:20:53.217 --> 01:20:55.567
MARISHA: But I can see it, she's not wrong.

01:20:55.567 --> 01:20:56.400
I can...

01:20:58.347 --> 01:21:00.137
You can start to see it.

01:21:02.077 --> 01:21:03.190
SAM: If you believe?

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:06.627
LAURA: (gasps) Clap your hands, Beau!

01:21:06.627 --> 01:21:07.947
SAM: Like a unicorn?
LAURA: Clap your hands!

01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:10.284
MARISHA: No, I'm not doing that, no.

01:21:10.284 --> 01:21:12.940
TRAVIS: (laughs) "No, I'm not doing that."

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.137
SAM: Well, let's set off, I guess.

01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:18.467
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:21:18.467 --> 01:21:19.930
MATT: As you guys gather your things,

01:21:21.325 --> 01:21:22.907
you put your packs up

01:21:22.907 --> 01:21:24.037
and you turn and right at that moment

01:21:24.037 --> 01:21:25.437
you can see the Tomb Takers are all standing there,

01:21:25.437 --> 01:21:29.847
and Lucien, in not a confrontational way,

01:21:29.847 --> 01:21:31.097
but in a definitely like,

01:21:32.357 --> 01:21:34.237
hold up a second, sort of physicality.

01:21:34.237 --> 01:21:35.070
Lucien goes,

01:21:36.817 --> 01:21:41.567
"As requested, to build trust in the bridge

01:21:41.567 --> 01:21:44.210
"that's been so asked of us,

01:21:45.077 --> 01:21:47.927
"I've shown you something very private and personal to me.

01:21:50.767 --> 01:21:51.750
"As a response,

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:56.127
"just show me that you still have it."

01:21:58.167 --> 01:22:00.340
LAURA: Pull it out, Caleb, show him your wang.

01:22:02.089 --> 01:22:04.437
LIAM: Fjord, show him my wang.

01:22:05.835 --> 01:22:07.276
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right.

01:22:07.276 --> 01:22:09.977
I'll reach into the Bag of Holding.

01:22:09.977 --> 01:22:11.890
Produce a small piece of amber.

01:22:13.837 --> 01:22:14.670
It's in here.

01:22:26.017 --> 01:22:26.940
LAURA: Cute, isn't it?

01:22:28.267 --> 01:22:29.557
MATT: "Quite clever."

01:22:29.557 --> 01:22:30.497
MARISHA: Wave to Vess.

01:22:33.459 --> 01:22:35.959
MATT: "(laughs)

01:22:37.288 --> 01:22:39.205
"Two keepsakes in one?

01:22:41.377 --> 01:22:44.057
"Well," and looks over towards to Zoran, you see

01:22:44.057 --> 01:22:46.592
is carrying the large other one on his back.

01:22:46.592 --> 01:22:48.410
"It's a much easier way to travel!

01:22:49.327 --> 01:22:51.544
"Shame you don't have these fancy things, eh?"

01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:55.717
(as Zoran) "Can you make more of those?"

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:58.607
LIAM: I don't, but there's more room in it,

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:01.890
if you'd like to have us carry anything for you.

01:23:10.357 --> 01:23:11.637
MATT: (as Lucien) "Now, why shouldn't I just take this

01:23:11.637 --> 01:23:12.610
"right now from you?"

01:23:15.097 --> 01:23:16.302
LAURA: Because you like us.

01:23:16.302 --> 01:23:18.035
TALIESIN: Would be a poor sign of trust.

01:23:25.997 --> 01:23:26.830
LIAM: If you hold onto it,

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:28.867
you won't get to stay in my tower tonight.

01:23:29.877 --> 01:23:31.410
TRAVIS: It is so warm in there.

01:23:32.494 --> 01:23:34.094
LAURA: And there's lots of good food.

01:23:37.547 --> 01:23:39.107
MATT: "As we said,

01:23:39.107 --> 01:23:41.690
"when we arrive, we get this.

01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:43.704
"We made a deal."

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:46.203
TRAVIS: We did.

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:50.914
SAM: The whole time,

01:23:50.914 --> 01:23:53.074
I was just watching to see if there was any sleight

01:23:53.074 --> 01:23:55.845
of hand thing that went on.

01:23:55.845 --> 01:23:57.335
MATT: Yeah, go ahead, make a perception check.

01:23:57.335 --> 01:23:59.707
SAM: Okay. Yeah, that's a one.

01:23:59.707 --> 01:24:03.460
(laughter)
MARISHA: No. That was cool.

01:24:04.546 --> 01:24:07.084
LIAM: It still could be. She is a halfling.

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:08.034
I'll just point out.

01:24:08.034 --> 01:24:09.752
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah.

01:24:09.752 --> 01:24:11.124
TRAVIS: I'll look at the amber.

01:24:11.124 --> 01:24:14.354
Do I see a little-- does it look like the--?

01:24:14.354 --> 01:24:15.187
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:24:15.187 --> 01:24:20.187
TRAVIS: Oh boy, let me fail that as well. 14.

01:24:20.464 --> 01:24:23.222
MATT: 14. No, it looks like it's the same as it

01:24:23.222 --> 01:24:27.584
was given over.
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check

01:24:27.584 --> 01:24:30.110
on that little test he just did?

01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:32.851
MATT: Sure, go for it. What are you looking for?

01:24:34.006 --> 01:24:36.214
MARISHA: Would he have actually just taken it from us?

01:24:36.214 --> 01:24:37.047
MATT: Go for it.

01:24:37.984 --> 01:24:40.814
MARISHA: Or is he just-- yeah, that's bad.

01:24:40.814 --> 01:24:42.164
Not a one, but it's bad.

01:24:42.164 --> 01:24:44.174
LIAM: But you're also a halfling.

01:24:44.174 --> 01:24:47.064
MARISHA: But I'm also a halfling. 14.

01:24:47.064 --> 01:24:49.004
MATT: Fourteen? That's not too bad.

01:24:49.004 --> 01:24:50.617
He wasn't trying to hide much.

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:55.574
I'd say the best that you can make out was, it was not hard

01:24:55.574 --> 01:24:57.084
to see that there was a look of relief

01:24:57.084 --> 01:24:59.317
on his face when he received it.

01:25:01.544 --> 01:25:03.937
That's as much as you'd be able to gather with a 14.

01:25:04.954 --> 01:25:05.787
MARISHA: Okay.

01:25:06.887 --> 01:25:11.159
MATT: There was a noticeable, like, (relieved sigh).

01:25:11.159 --> 01:25:14.908
MARISHA: "Oh, they aren't totally
bullshitting me. Ah." Okay.

01:25:14.908 --> 01:25:17.025
TRAVIS: It's not A1, we are.

01:25:18.499 --> 01:25:19.332
MATT: So.

01:25:19.332 --> 01:25:20.637
TRAVIS: If we didn't it would just be--
MARISHA: Keymaster.

01:25:20.637 --> 01:25:23.762
TRAVIS: -- a little inconvenient.
MARISHA: Gatekeeper, yeah.

01:25:27.334 --> 01:25:29.654
LAURA: Are we going straight to, you know,

01:25:30.534 --> 01:25:32.201
the big site now?

01:25:32.201 --> 01:25:34.734
MATT: "Here's hoping so. One more day of travel.

01:25:34.734 --> 01:25:36.057
"Gather your things."

01:25:38.904 --> 01:25:40.126
TRAVIS: Let's be off.
SAM: Yeah.

01:25:40.126 --> 01:25:41.474
MATT: All right.

01:25:41.474 --> 01:25:44.594
Who wants to roll the dice for the final length

01:25:44.594 --> 01:25:46.376
of the journey to see what happens?
SAM: My turn.

01:25:46.376 --> 01:25:47.894
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Your turn.

01:25:47.894 --> 01:25:49.937
SAM: Is it a d--?
MATT: d20.

01:25:51.294 --> 01:25:53.267
SAM: 10, right in the middle.

01:25:55.073 --> 01:25:56.494
MATT: (laughs)

01:25:56.494 --> 01:25:58.084
SAM: Oh no.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:25:58.084 --> 01:25:59.924
MATT: As you begin to trek off,

01:25:59.924 --> 01:26:03.674
the gray sky gets thicker--
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:26:03.674 --> 01:26:08.674
MATT: -- and thicker as the ice fog rolls in once more.

01:26:08.809 --> 01:26:10.594
LIAM and TALIESIN: (laugh)
TRAVIS: I blame the beard.

01:26:10.594 --> 01:26:13.666
MATT: I need everybody to make--
SAM: Sea-farin' weather.

01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:15.504
(laughter)

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.129
MATT: -- a group survival check,

01:26:17.129 --> 01:26:19.495
as this recurring weather pattern

01:26:19.495 --> 01:26:21.994
is one of the worst

01:26:21.994 --> 01:26:23.247
to encounter out here.

01:26:23.247 --> 01:26:25.609
LIAM: Got another cold front coming in from the west.

01:26:25.609 --> 01:26:26.825
LAURA: Survival.

01:26:26.825 --> 01:26:28.866
MARISHA: Yikes.
SAM: I rolled a one.

01:26:28.866 --> 01:26:30.471
MARISHA: Not rolling great.
TALIESIN: Not great.

01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:31.824
MATT: They're not rolling great either.

01:26:31.824 --> 01:26:33.164
SAM: I got a one, yeah.
TALIESIN: Got a one.

01:26:33.164 --> 01:26:34.884
MATT: Three, two, five, six.

01:26:34.884 --> 01:26:36.784
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: Wow.

01:26:36.784 --> 01:26:37.617
LAURA: Nine.

01:26:37.617 --> 01:26:38.455
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:26:38.455 --> 01:26:39.987
LIAM: Sixteen.

01:26:39.987 --> 01:26:40.820
SAM: One.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.466
ASHLEY: One.
MATT: Yeah, no.

01:26:42.466 --> 01:26:44.591
Don't even care.
LAURA: Oh, mega fail.

01:26:44.591 --> 01:26:45.696
TRAVIS: What'd you get? You didn't say it.

01:26:45.696 --> 01:26:47.120
MARISHA: 12.
LIAM: I'm MacGyver in the group.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.503
ASHLEY: Wait, did you got a one, too?

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:49.336
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:26:49.336 --> 01:26:50.608
MARISHA: You got a one, too?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:26:50.608 --> 01:26:52.325
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled a 12.

01:26:52.325 --> 01:26:53.666
TALIESIN: Putting that die away.
MATT: That was--

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:54.499
ASHLEY: That was bad.

01:26:54.499 --> 01:26:57.060
MATT: -- by far and large the worst group check

01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:57.894
we've had in a while.

01:26:57.894 --> 01:26:59.804
LIAM: Oh, that's a real bad storm, that one.

01:26:59.804 --> 01:27:01.299
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:02.984
MATT: That's going to slow you down.

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.680
So it's no longer a one-day journey.

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.352
TALIESIN: Yeah!
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:27:08.352 --> 01:27:10.535
LIAM: ♪ A three-hour tour ♪

01:27:10.535 --> 01:27:12.144
(laughter)

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:14.084
MATT: Remember the last time you guys had a frustrating bit

01:27:14.084 --> 01:27:16.747
of being lost amongst this ice fog?

01:27:16.747 --> 01:27:19.654
LAURA: It was with them, because they lost us.

01:27:19.654 --> 01:27:21.334
MATT: Yeah, and as you're getting
through halfway through the day

01:27:21.334 --> 01:27:24.254
you can hear Lucien's like, "Son of a--

01:27:24.254 --> 01:27:25.087
"Well...

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.153
"This way."

01:27:29.194 --> 01:27:30.794
LAURA: Oh no.
MARISHA: Last time this happened

01:27:30.794 --> 01:27:33.157
we should've just hunkered down and waited it out.

01:27:33.157 --> 01:27:34.417
MATT: "You prefer to do that?"

01:27:35.794 --> 01:27:37.497
MARISHA: Unless you're confident,

01:27:38.594 --> 01:27:41.094
more confident than you were the first time, dude.

01:27:43.574 --> 01:27:47.469
Because we were really tired after that, got nowhere.

01:27:47.469 --> 01:27:49.374
TALIESIN: No, he's going to say that we move.

01:27:49.374 --> 01:27:51.674
Patience is not one of his strong suits.

01:27:51.674 --> 01:27:52.901
MATT: "I think we can do this."

01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:56.124
(laughter)

01:27:56.124 --> 01:27:58.334
MATT: "I feel it. This way."

01:27:58.334 --> 01:27:59.534
SAM: All right.

01:27:59.534 --> 01:28:01.093
MARISHA: Cool.
SAM: Let's go.

01:28:01.093 --> 01:28:04.747
MATT: Trekking through the freezing ice fog, shaking.

01:28:05.974 --> 01:28:07.924
You all eventually get to a certain point

01:28:07.924 --> 01:28:10.944
where you come upon familiar tracks at the end of the day.

01:28:10.944 --> 01:28:12.277
And Lucien goes, "Shoot."

01:28:12.277 --> 01:28:13.285
SAM: Oh, they're ours.

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:15.817
LAURA: Wow, how did these tracks stay here?

01:28:15.817 --> 01:28:17.517
It's been snowing so much.

01:28:17.517 --> 01:28:19.616
ASHLEY: Wait, whose tracks are these?

01:28:19.616 --> 01:28:21.834
MATT: It's turned into an ice fog at this point.

01:28:21.834 --> 01:28:23.399
The snow has diminished.

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.509
At which point everyone's going (shivering).

01:28:27.509 --> 01:28:30.884
It's starting to get a little dark. Lucien goes, "I--

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:35.214
"I hate this place."

01:28:35.214 --> 01:28:36.324
TALIESIN: A humble person would say

01:28:36.324 --> 01:28:39.196
that there was probably a lesson here, although the like--

01:28:39.196 --> 01:28:41.380
MATT: "We camp up for the night."

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.774
MARISHA: Hmm.

01:28:42.774 --> 01:28:44.664
LAURA: Do you want a tower?

01:28:44.664 --> 01:28:46.714
MATT: "If you don't mind."
LAURA: (gasps)

01:28:46.714 --> 01:28:48.414
LIAM: This is why we are friends.

01:28:50.005 --> 01:28:51.088
MATT: "Good."

01:28:53.308 --> 01:28:54.984
(as Lucien) (sighs) "All right, fine."

01:28:54.984 --> 01:28:56.675
MARISHA: The entire time Caleb sets it up,

01:28:56.675 --> 01:28:58.216
I just stare at Lucien.

01:28:59.644 --> 01:29:01.824
MATT: He doesn't make eye contact with you.

01:29:01.824 --> 01:29:03.714
You do see the red eye on the neck--

01:29:03.714 --> 01:29:04.594
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:04.594 --> 01:29:06.954
MATT: -- shift to make eye contact with you, though.

01:29:06.954 --> 01:29:11.852
MARISHA: I just slow Jack Nicholson nod at the eye.

01:29:11.852 --> 01:29:14.102
(laughter)

01:29:17.384 --> 01:29:19.464
MATT: And so he looks at you expectantly, like--

01:29:19.464 --> 01:29:20.434
LIAM: <i>Ja, ja</i>.

01:29:20.434 --> 01:29:22.074
The wands jams down into the snow.

01:29:22.074 --> 01:29:25.004
I arrange all the pieces necessary, the little wooden cat.

01:29:25.004 --> 01:29:29.104
And then (whooshing) and we see stained glass again.

01:29:29.104 --> 01:29:29.937
MATT: All right.

01:29:30.954 --> 01:29:35.684
Quickly, you watch as the Tomb Takers one by one

01:29:35.684 --> 01:29:38.104
enter, except for Lucien who is waiting

01:29:38.104 --> 01:29:39.634
for the rest of you to enter

01:29:39.634 --> 01:29:42.597
so he can follow and bookend the journey inward.

01:29:43.774 --> 01:29:47.884
You all enter to a more comfortable space within

01:29:47.884 --> 01:29:49.627
Widogast's Nein-Sided Tower.

01:29:51.598 --> 01:29:53.414
SAM: So much nicer.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:29:53.414 --> 01:29:55.955
TRAVIS: I prefer this so much. Up!

01:29:55.955 --> 01:29:58.944
(laughter)

01:29:58.944 --> 01:30:01.284
SAM: Will we still suffer a point of exhaustion?

01:30:01.284 --> 01:30:02.750
MATT: You will tomorrow.

01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:04.074
LAURA: Ugh.

01:30:04.074 --> 01:30:06.594
MARISHA: The worst.
LAURA: I'm going to take a bath tonight.

01:30:06.594 --> 01:30:08.736
Just to make sure--
LIAM: The beds are so comfy, though.

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:11.111
Like, way more comfy than normal, so.

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:13.634
MATT: You're going to be real sore in the morning.

01:30:13.634 --> 01:30:14.467
LIAM: Okay.

01:30:15.359 --> 01:30:16.224
MATT: It's a combination

01:30:16.224 --> 01:30:19.344
of sore muscles, a combination of near hypothermia.

01:30:19.344 --> 01:30:22.564
While many things came together to make you comfortable

01:30:22.564 --> 01:30:24.104
for the night.

01:30:24.104 --> 01:30:26.774
But you can already tell the damage has been done

01:30:26.774 --> 01:30:28.697
and the morning's going to be a reckoning.

01:30:30.784 --> 01:30:33.234
SAM: Is tomorrow the day that we get there?

01:30:33.234 --> 01:30:35.084
TRAVIS: Not anymore.
MATT: (chuckles)

01:30:35.084 --> 01:30:36.612
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Got one more day of travel.

01:30:36.612 --> 01:30:38.117
MARISHA: We lost a day.
SAM: And then we're there.

01:30:38.117 --> 01:30:40.874
Because I do have-- I have a thing.

01:30:40.874 --> 01:30:44.204
Not saying this in front of Lucien.

01:30:44.204 --> 01:30:47.054
I have two doses of something

01:30:47.054 --> 01:30:50.334
that will help two of us

01:30:50.334 --> 01:30:52.264
not be exhausted tomorrow.

01:30:52.264 --> 01:30:55.494
If that's something that we are interested in.

01:30:55.494 --> 01:30:57.327
TRAVIS: Hmm.
MARISHA: Doses?

01:30:58.514 --> 01:31:02.794
SAM: It's a leaf that Caduceus can help brew into a tea

01:31:02.794 --> 01:31:03.887
that we can drink.

01:31:05.464 --> 01:31:08.317
It's an olisuba leaf,

01:31:09.554 --> 01:31:11.914
which helps you recover from exhaustion.

01:31:11.914 --> 01:31:13.527
But I only have two leaves.

01:31:14.634 --> 01:31:17.427
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind giving it to the wizard.

01:31:19.264 --> 01:31:20.564
LAURA: Oh yeah.
TRAVIS: Anyone else?

01:31:22.094 --> 01:31:24.752
SAM: Exhaustion affects skill checks, right?

01:31:24.752 --> 01:31:25.964
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: So who does that a lot?

01:31:25.964 --> 01:31:28.750
Perception checks, investigation checks?

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:30.282
LAURA: You.
LIAM: If we are going

01:31:30.282 --> 01:31:33.018
into any ruins, then it would make sense for me.

01:31:33.018 --> 01:31:35.644
But if not, then not, Nott.

01:31:35.644 --> 01:31:37.504
LAURA: But you might be looking at the book again.

01:31:37.504 --> 01:31:38.344
SAM: Yeah.

01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:40.944
ASHLEY: What about you two?

01:31:41.819 --> 01:31:43.289
You two?
SAM: Us two?

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:45.124
LIAM: Want to share some tea?

01:31:45.124 --> 01:31:47.431
Little tea and tea?
SAM: If you guys are okay with that.

01:31:47.431 --> 01:31:48.464
TALIESIN: I'll get the kettle.

01:31:48.464 --> 01:31:49.981
SAM: Thank you.

01:31:49.981 --> 01:31:52.594
LAURA: Where's Lucien?

01:31:52.594 --> 01:31:54.784
MATT: He now steps into the door behind

01:31:54.784 --> 01:31:55.784
and closes it.

01:31:56.934 --> 01:31:58.737
All of them are looking around.

01:31:59.784 --> 01:32:01.857
Lucien is the first to pipe up.

01:32:03.004 --> 01:32:07.667
"Not going to lie, this is a very welcome change of pace.

01:32:09.684 --> 01:32:10.517
"My thanks."

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.417
LIAM: If you're a good boy,
we can do this every night.

01:32:15.367 --> 01:32:17.458
MATT: "I like it when you're condescending.

01:32:17.458 --> 01:32:18.694
"It's attractive."

01:32:18.694 --> 01:32:19.954
TALIESIN: He's always condescending.

01:32:19.954 --> 01:32:21.354
SAM: He's always attractive.

01:32:21.354 --> 01:32:23.156
MATT: "That's dangerous."
LAURA: (laughs)

01:32:23.156 --> 01:32:26.849
TRAVIS: Behold me into the tower of Widogast!

01:32:26.849 --> 01:32:28.339
(laughter)

01:32:28.339 --> 01:32:31.730
TRAVIS: Fear me! You can do, too, you just say, "up."

01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:33.240
(laughter)

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:37.727
MATT: Lucien just goes, "Up. (laughs)

01:32:37.727 --> 01:32:39.937
"Full of surprises. Well?"

01:32:39.937 --> 01:32:41.360
And the rest of the Tomb Takers go, "Up!" "Up!" "Up!"

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.127
And they all start drifting up.

01:32:43.127 --> 01:32:46.124
And they start just rushing off and exploring.

01:32:46.124 --> 01:32:48.654
LIAM: Okay, if any of them try to go outside

01:32:48.654 --> 01:32:51.184
of the central invisible column

01:32:51.184 --> 01:32:52.414
that's 10 feet wide in the center,

01:32:52.414 --> 01:32:54.534
they're going to start to float or fall back down.

01:32:54.534 --> 01:32:59.534
So it's just the center invisible spoke.

01:32:59.534 --> 01:33:02.714
MATT: Okay and they do, they sort of--

01:33:02.714 --> 01:33:03.886
It's a fizzy lifting drink moment.

01:33:03.886 --> 01:33:07.030
They're all just like "What's going on?" there.

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:08.814
For as intimidating as they've been

01:33:08.814 --> 01:33:11.074
since you've met them, to certain degrees,

01:33:11.074 --> 01:33:16.074
this is the most adorable they've been.

01:33:16.574 --> 01:33:18.259
If I could put it that way.

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.661
TALIESIN: Wait 'til they find out about the food.

01:33:21.994 --> 01:33:24.454
MATT: But nevertheless, the evening in the tower is yours.

01:33:24.454 --> 01:33:27.514
Lucien does ask, "Is there a particular chambers

01:33:27.514 --> 01:33:29.494
"for us to be staying?"

01:33:29.494 --> 01:33:34.494
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I have one set of
chambers for you and your friends.

01:33:34.724 --> 01:33:37.015
MATT: "All right. Where?"

01:33:37.015 --> 01:33:38.348
LIAM: Ah, follow me.

01:33:39.344 --> 01:33:42.824
I don't say up and I float up through the center.

01:33:42.824 --> 01:33:46.157
Come along, and take us up to five

01:33:46.157 --> 01:33:48.448
and rap on the door

01:33:48.448 --> 01:33:51.584
with no decoration on the outside of it.

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:53.134
This is for you. And I open the door,

01:33:53.134 --> 01:33:56.264
and inside the sitting room

01:33:56.264 --> 01:34:00.234
is all the walls are covered in stained glass windows

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:02.054
that you cannot see through them.

01:34:02.054 --> 01:34:05.884
But you do see those small little globules

01:34:05.884 --> 01:34:10.044
floating just behind in one direction slowly.

01:34:10.044 --> 01:34:14.528
And the windows show scenes from Mollymauk's

01:34:14.528 --> 01:34:18.164
Fletchling and Moondrop circus, just tableaus

01:34:18.164 --> 01:34:21.214
of the different performers and Mollymauk himself.

01:34:21.214 --> 01:34:25.254
And there is one window that shows a scene

01:34:25.254 --> 01:34:29.274
with the devil toad and the Mighty Nein in the circus

01:34:29.274 --> 01:34:31.864
erupting, beautifully wrought.

01:34:31.864 --> 01:34:35.964
And the mirror--

01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:39.189
not mirror, the glass window

01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:44.182
above the fireplace is Caleb's imagination of the city

01:34:45.954 --> 01:34:47.547
that he's seen in their vision.

01:34:49.764 --> 01:34:51.054
Move us through to the next quarters.

01:34:51.054 --> 01:34:53.064
And there are bunk beds and--

01:34:53.064 --> 01:34:56.807
MATT: As you pass the stained glass relief of the city,

01:34:58.534 --> 01:35:01.984
Lucien glances over it for a moment, pauses,

01:35:01.984 --> 01:35:05.767
and just says absentmindedly to you almost,

01:35:08.314 --> 01:35:09.922
"You've seen more than you let on.

01:35:11.364 --> 01:35:12.197
"Huh."

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:14.274
Just continues with you.

01:35:15.764 --> 01:35:16.597
LIAM: Dare to dream.

01:35:18.474 --> 01:35:20.394
You can all sleep in here.

01:35:20.394 --> 01:35:22.624
And there are bunk beds enough for all

01:35:22.624 --> 01:35:25.347
of Lucien's Tomb Takers, but not Lucien.

01:35:26.244 --> 01:35:27.810
And I push through to the final room

01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:29.604
and there is a similar bed

01:35:29.604 --> 01:35:32.724
and bathtub, all the same amenities

01:35:32.724 --> 01:35:37.659
but the drapery is Mollymauk's ornate coat.

01:35:42.101 --> 01:35:43.384
MATT: As they all glance around

01:35:43.384 --> 01:35:45.903
and make in the space, and nod.

01:35:52.174 --> 01:35:54.382
Pretty high passive insight.

01:35:55.882 --> 01:35:56.890
Lucien--

01:36:00.024 --> 01:36:02.282
other than his normally confident self,

01:36:02.282 --> 01:36:05.891
seems to have a faint touch of apprehension.

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:12.334
But then quickly they all turn.

01:36:12.334 --> 01:36:16.247
Tyffial goes, "Is there a meal included as well?"

01:36:17.164 --> 01:36:19.444
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, so I would say, make yourself comfortable

01:36:19.444 --> 01:36:24.124
in about an hour, exit your chambers and go higher

01:36:24.124 --> 01:36:26.847
up until you reach the room with all of the cats in it.

01:36:28.024 --> 01:36:28.857
MATT: "Very well."

01:36:28.857 --> 01:36:31.431
They all look at each other and Cree goes,

01:36:31.431 --> 01:36:33.031
"We'll be down shortly."

01:36:34.834 --> 01:36:38.114
And they all huddle up a bit as you make your way

01:36:38.114 --> 01:36:40.947
to wherever you wish to.
LIAM: Hmm.

01:36:44.384 --> 01:36:45.467
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:46.542
MATT: Yes, you may.
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

01:36:47.934 --> 01:36:50.104
LAURA: I don't remember where Dagen went.

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:50.937
SAM: He's been following us.

01:36:50.937 --> 01:36:52.158
LAURA: Is he just following us?
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:36:52.158 --> 01:36:52.991
TRAVIS: In the ice fog.

01:36:52.991 --> 01:36:55.814
LAURA: So now he's, like, fucking--
SAM: He's like a tracker guy!

01:36:55.814 --> 01:36:57.974
He knows what-- he was probably, all day today

01:36:57.974 --> 01:37:00.944
he was like, "Go that way, you idiots."

01:37:00.944 --> 01:37:03.204
MATT: You certainly hope so.

01:37:03.204 --> 01:37:06.012
LIAM: He's our ringer.
LAURA: I'm going to send him a message.

01:37:06.012 --> 01:37:08.204
MARISHA: Yeah, and you know, tell him to just meet us

01:37:08.204 --> 01:37:11.212
at Aeor. Mm-hmm?

01:37:11.212 --> 01:37:12.364
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:37:12.364 --> 01:37:13.197
MARISHA: Meet us there.

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:17.364
LIAM: Go to Aeor, go to Aeor.

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:19.904
MARISHA: I know, I know, I thought about him.

01:37:19.904 --> 01:37:22.844
TRAVIS: Like did he cross the
lava stuff when we did it and--?

01:37:22.844 --> 01:37:24.283
LAURA: Yeah, all of those things.
SAM: He's a badass.

01:37:24.283 --> 01:37:26.414
TRAVIS: Remember it was collapsing behind us, though?

01:37:26.414 --> 01:37:29.694
And falling to shit just as we were crossing and--

01:37:29.694 --> 01:37:31.464
SAM: He's fine.
TRAVIS: Okay, yep.

01:37:31.464 --> 01:37:32.644
SAM: He can fly.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:37:32.644 --> 01:37:35.221
MARISHA: He's better without us.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:37:35.221 --> 01:37:37.212
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:37:37.212 --> 01:37:38.045
MATT: All right.

01:37:38.045 --> 01:37:39.303
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Dagen

01:37:39.303 --> 01:37:42.424
when I'm, you know, alone.

01:37:42.424 --> 01:37:47.424
And say: Hey, just making sure everything's okay back there.

01:37:48.534 --> 01:37:49.714
Did you follow us?

01:37:49.714 --> 01:37:51.297
We're in the tower tonight.

01:37:52.454 --> 01:37:55.957
Dang this is crazy stuff, man.

01:37:55.957 --> 01:37:57.374
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:37:57.374 --> 01:37:58.207
LAURA: To Aeor!

01:37:58.207 --> 01:38:00.902
(laughter)
TRAVIS: At the--!

01:38:00.902 --> 01:38:02.643
At the end!

01:38:04.399 --> 01:38:05.774
Fuck me!

01:38:08.174 --> 01:38:11.716
Oh shit!
SAM and MARISHA: To Aeor!

01:38:11.716 --> 01:38:14.592
MATT: I love you, Laura.
MARISHA: It's the new, "To Zadash."

01:38:14.592 --> 01:38:17.742
(laughter)

01:38:17.742 --> 01:38:18.575
TRAVIS: Ridiculous.

01:38:20.154 --> 01:38:21.674
MATT: A moment passes that makes you slightly nervous.

01:38:21.674 --> 01:38:26.364
And then, "All right, best I can tell you all

01:38:26.364 --> 01:38:29.973
just disappeared into that weird doorway again."

01:38:29.973 --> 01:38:32.124
(laughter)

01:38:32.124 --> 01:38:33.839
MATT: "I'm not too far off.

01:38:39.464 --> 01:38:42.998
"Maybe no more lava."

01:38:42.998 --> 01:38:47.007
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:38:48.844 --> 01:38:50.154
MATT: That's all the response you get,

01:38:50.154 --> 01:38:55.154
but he's worth his money and gold.

01:38:55.524 --> 01:38:57.534
For all the shit that's gone down, he's the only--

01:38:57.534 --> 01:38:59.234
he's probably, yeah, going through the fog,

01:38:59.234 --> 01:39:00.187
the ice fog, going like,

01:39:00.187 --> 01:39:01.734
"Where the fuck are they going?"

01:39:01.734 --> 01:39:03.360
(laughter)

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.825
MATT: But yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

01:39:06.754 --> 01:39:08.212
TRAVIS: I'll take 30 minutes to attune

01:39:08.212 --> 01:39:09.395
to whatever this armor is.

01:39:09.395 --> 01:39:10.664
And what is it called again?

01:39:10.664 --> 01:39:12.102
MATT: It's studded leather, plus two.

01:39:12.102 --> 01:39:14.754
TRAVIS: Studded leather, plus two.

01:39:14.754 --> 01:39:17.614
MARISHA: I'm going to head to the kitchen or wherever

01:39:17.614 --> 01:39:20.190
and find the rest of the Mighty Nein.

01:39:20.190 --> 01:39:21.023
MATT: Okay.

01:39:21.023 --> 01:39:22.623
MARISHA: Wherever people seem to be convening.

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.731
SAM: We're making our tea, probably.

01:39:24.731 --> 01:39:27.314
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:39:29.574 --> 01:39:31.424
TALIESIN: Honey? Honey? Honey?

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:32.349
SAM: Sure, sweetie.

01:39:32.349 --> 01:39:34.284
TALIESIN: All right.

01:39:34.284 --> 01:39:37.904
LIAM: Actually, why don't I take us up to our laboratory?

01:39:37.904 --> 01:39:39.614
SAM: Sure.
LIAM: And make the tea there

01:39:39.614 --> 01:39:41.874
with the--
SAM: In a beaker?

01:39:41.874 --> 01:39:43.125
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
SAM: Cool.

01:39:43.125 --> 01:39:45.328
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
SAM: (laughs)

01:39:45.328 --> 01:39:47.579
MARISHA: Can I follow?
LIAM: Yeah, come along, yeah.

01:39:47.579 --> 01:39:49.504
Have I brought you guys up there yet?

01:39:49.504 --> 01:39:50.517
MARISHA: No, you haven't.

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.964
ASHLEY: We haven't seen the laboratory.

01:39:52.964 --> 01:39:55.554
LAURA: I didn't know there was a laboratory.

01:39:55.554 --> 01:39:57.674
SAM: You know, we've also never seen what's up

01:39:57.674 --> 01:40:00.747
on eight and nine, I think, right?

01:40:02.544 --> 01:40:03.377
Have we?

01:40:03.377 --> 01:40:05.614
ASHLEY: Do you want to give us a full--?

01:40:05.614 --> 01:40:07.734
SAM: Might be the last night we are alive and stuff.

01:40:07.734 --> 01:40:10.997
Maybe we should see the attic?

01:40:12.334 --> 01:40:15.784
MARISHA: Why you keep looking at me?
LAURA: You have more stained glass up there?

01:40:15.784 --> 01:40:17.873
SAM: Fuck dolls?
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:40:17.873 --> 01:40:19.814
MARISHA: You can either show us or I was maybe thinking

01:40:19.814 --> 01:40:22.097
about just planning a B&amp;E for fun.

01:40:24.278 --> 01:40:26.004
LIAM: That would be interesting to see.

01:40:26.004 --> 01:40:27.212
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:40:30.697 --> 01:40:32.724
SAM: Or if it's too sensitive, we'll just

01:40:32.724 --> 01:40:33.854
have out tea in the lab?

01:40:33.854 --> 01:40:36.594
LIAM: No, I'll show you. Let's have the tea,

01:40:37.735 --> 01:40:39.394
and then I'll show you.

01:40:42.914 --> 01:40:45.064
LAURA: Do we have stuff other than the good tea?

01:40:45.064 --> 01:40:46.287
Do we have normal tea?

01:40:47.324 --> 01:40:48.874
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, always.
LAURA: Okay.

01:40:48.874 --> 01:40:53.004
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're in the tower we got everything.

01:40:54.094 --> 01:40:56.734
MATT: So you brew multiple teas.

01:40:56.734 --> 01:40:59.814
Is there anything you'd wish to go over during this time?

01:40:59.814 --> 01:41:02.184
Or do you wish to go to rest?

01:41:02.184 --> 01:41:05.864
MARISHA: I was thinking about this Cobalt Reserve dilemma.

01:41:05.864 --> 01:41:10.341
SAM: Oh boy, I see geometric shapes all over your head.

01:41:10.341 --> 01:41:11.889
Math equations.

01:41:13.914 --> 01:41:15.484
MARISHA: It's going to be really tough to get out of here

01:41:15.484 --> 01:41:18.877
and get back to the Reserve, to talk to Yudala Fon.

01:41:21.534 --> 01:41:24.964
The only idea that I have right now would be to try

01:41:24.964 --> 01:41:28.467
and maybe reach out to Dairon and see where they are.

01:41:30.104 --> 01:41:33.554
Maybe Dairon can be our liaison for us.

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:35.667
Talk to Yudala Fon, get information.

01:41:38.924 --> 01:41:41.144
And then I don't know what, I don't know

01:41:41.144 --> 01:41:44.867
if we could try and figure out a way to get Dairon to us.

01:41:48.284 --> 01:41:49.351
I don't know.

01:41:49.351 --> 01:41:53.064
SAM: Essek could go get her, maybe?

01:41:57.259 --> 01:41:58.514
LAURA: But teleporting,

01:41:58.514 --> 01:42:00.674
that means Essek would have to teleport in.

01:42:00.674 --> 01:42:01.507
SAM: Yeah.

01:42:01.507 --> 01:42:03.334
LAURA: Nobody can get here quickly.

01:42:03.334 --> 01:42:04.167
MARISHA: If that's the case

01:42:04.167 --> 01:42:06.704
then he might as well take me and we can come back.

01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:09.307
SAM: Yeah, might not be worth it.

01:42:10.726 --> 01:42:12.542
MARISHA: (exhales) I'm kind of wondering--

01:42:12.542 --> 01:42:14.225
LIAM: Going in and out is dangerous.
TALIESIN: Wait a minute.

01:42:15.854 --> 01:42:17.634
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

01:42:17.634 --> 01:42:20.134
SAM: Is there a spell that can send an item?

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:23.134
We could teleport an item, like,
they could write it all down

01:42:23.134 --> 01:42:24.974
and then (whoosh) foof it to us.

01:42:24.974 --> 01:42:27.548
LIAM: Same spell, but sure, still risky.
SAM: If we lose an item,

01:42:27.548 --> 01:42:30.464
then it's fine, it's not a life.

01:42:30.464 --> 01:42:32.297
LIAM: Depends on the item.

01:42:34.854 --> 01:42:38.234
MARISHA: I mean, that would have to be the way to go, right?

01:42:38.234 --> 01:42:42.294
Try to figure out-- because yeah, I don't know

01:42:42.294 --> 01:42:45.024
if at this point the Cobalt Reserve has any more information

01:42:45.024 --> 01:42:47.804
than we do. It's a gamble

01:42:49.644 --> 01:42:52.674
SAM: And their information might be there is no information

01:42:52.674 --> 01:42:56.594
because someone burned it all and that's all we find out.

01:42:56.594 --> 01:43:00.564
MARISHA: Well, the way it seems like Yudala was acting

01:43:00.564 --> 01:43:03.834
it seems like they found something

01:43:03.834 --> 01:43:06.347
of some pretty significant importance.

01:43:08.674 --> 01:43:12.624
They didn't want to convey it over a message spell.

01:43:12.624 --> 01:43:15.041
LAURA: Maybe it was just too long.

01:43:17.504 --> 01:43:18.804
Maybe they don't trust me.

01:43:20.014 --> 01:43:22.914
LIAM: If you did want to try to get some help here

01:43:24.844 --> 01:43:29.844
I could send a stone, anything from where we are

01:43:31.054 --> 01:43:32.444
through to one of the circles.

01:43:32.444 --> 01:43:36.106
And that would lessen the risk, not remove it.

01:43:36.106 --> 01:43:37.831
MARISHA: Like communicator stones?

01:43:37.831 --> 01:43:38.922
LIAM: No, no.

01:43:38.922 --> 01:43:42.074
As long as I have an object from this location,

01:43:42.074 --> 01:43:46.194
as long as they have it, that ordinarily ensures

01:43:46.194 --> 01:43:47.897
that you will reach your destination safely.

01:43:47.897 --> 01:43:51.044
You know, I don't know what the chances of harm are

01:43:52.304 --> 01:43:53.574
because of the nature of this place.

01:43:53.574 --> 01:43:56.144
But if we were to send something as simple as a rock through

01:43:56.144 --> 01:44:00.904
from our location to them and they use that to return here,

01:44:00.904 --> 01:44:03.224
it's at least increasing their chances of success,

01:44:03.224 --> 01:44:04.082
I believe.

01:44:06.733 --> 01:44:08.046
LAURA: What were you going to say?
MATT: I was going to to say

01:44:08.046 --> 01:44:13.046
you gathered from the message that reached you

01:44:13.344 --> 01:44:15.157
from Yudala Fon that they were more--

01:44:17.659 --> 01:44:20.744
they were aware of the limitations of the spell,

01:44:20.744 --> 01:44:23.504
and it would be ridiculous to try and convey any

01:44:23.504 --> 01:44:27.264
of the information they've found in a short number of words.

01:44:27.264 --> 01:44:29.864
It didn't seem like it was

01:44:29.864 --> 01:44:33.174
with extreme urgency

01:44:33.174 --> 01:44:35.144
and more like, "We have some information,

01:44:35.144 --> 01:44:38.144
"but this is not the way to converse."

01:44:40.269 --> 01:44:41.102
LAURA: Hmm.

01:44:44.284 --> 01:44:47.024
MARISHA: Maybe we just reach back out to Yudala

01:44:47.024 --> 01:44:48.504
and ask them if there's anything that they can do

01:44:48.504 --> 01:44:53.170
to send a message that, I think,

01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:55.470
like you were saying, like a written something

01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:57.955
over a longer period, I don't know.

01:44:57.955 --> 01:45:00.892
LAURA: How would we get it?
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:45:00.892 --> 01:45:05.871
(deep sighs)

01:45:06.904 --> 01:45:08.594
LIAM: Maybe we're on our own here.

01:45:08.594 --> 01:45:10.011
SAM: Yeah, probably.

01:45:13.334 --> 01:45:15.717
Well, this tea is very nice.

01:45:16.724 --> 01:45:20.227
Should we turn in?

01:45:21.466 --> 01:45:23.805
LAURA: I think we were going to go eat food.
MARISHA: Dinner.

01:45:23.805 --> 01:45:24.638
LAURA: With them.

01:45:26.596 --> 01:45:27.429
SAM: Sure.

01:45:29.064 --> 01:45:30.514
MARISHA: Let's go eat.
LIAM: Okay.

01:45:31.824 --> 01:45:34.391
MARISHA: Unless you wanted to give us,
like, a more extensive tour.

01:45:34.391 --> 01:45:37.529
SAM: If that's what you wanted to do.

01:45:42.848 --> 01:45:45.274
LIAM: <i>Fort, doch nicht vergessen.</i>

01:45:45.274 --> 01:45:49.744
And the iris in the central hallway opens

01:45:49.744 --> 01:45:52.897
to the eighth floor and Caleb floats up.

01:45:54.824 --> 01:45:55.813
LAURA: Augusten?

01:45:55.813 --> 01:45:59.394
SAM: <i>Fort</i> michanachren mich hagen mach.

01:45:59.394 --> 01:46:01.372
And I started levitating up as well.

01:46:01.372 --> 01:46:03.622
(laughter)

01:46:05.414 --> 01:46:06.897
No. Up?

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:09.424
LAURA: Did it work? Up!
LIAM: Yeah.

01:46:09.424 --> 01:46:11.980
You don't have to say up.

01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:12.813
TRAVIS: Don't we?

01:46:12.813 --> 01:46:14.296
LIAM: You just have to-- <i>you</i> have to.

01:46:14.296 --> 01:46:15.130
TRAVIS: Up!

01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:18.055
(laughter)

01:46:18.055 --> 01:46:21.554
LIAM: Caleb makes a mental note that the effect

01:46:21.554 --> 01:46:24.364
of the central chamber does not work for Fjord

01:46:24.364 --> 01:46:27.257
unless he says "Up" out loud.
(laughter)

01:46:27.257 --> 01:46:29.007
TRAVIS: It'll never be a problem.

01:46:29.007 --> 01:46:30.890
LIAM: Everyone else is fine.

01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:33.204
(laughter)

01:46:33.204 --> 01:46:34.487
Once you guys float up with me,

01:46:34.487 --> 01:46:39.074
there is a nine-sided inner chamber
at the heart of the tower

01:46:39.074 --> 01:46:42.533
and there are nine doors numbered.

01:46:46.374 --> 01:46:48.064
Pick three.

01:46:48.064 --> 01:46:50.395
LAURA: How much do you think it must be weirding Lucien out

01:46:50.395 --> 01:46:52.614
right now that it's a Nein-Sided Tower and everything's

01:46:52.614 --> 01:46:54.206
like nine, nine, nine, nine, nine in here.

01:46:54.206 --> 01:46:56.884
LIAM: A whole lot.
SAM: Pick three?

01:46:56.884 --> 01:46:59.024
LIAM: Pick three.
TRAVIS: Three doors?

01:46:59.024 --> 01:47:02.487
SAM: I'm will pick door four.

01:47:03.684 --> 01:47:05.197
MARISHA: I'll pick door nine.

01:47:05.197 --> 01:47:08.292
LAURA: Ooh.
TRAVIS: One.

01:47:08.292 --> 01:47:09.731
SAM: Okay.

01:47:09.731 --> 01:47:10.994
One, four, nine.

01:47:10.994 --> 01:47:11.827
LIAM: In that order?

01:47:13.654 --> 01:47:15.723
SAM: They would be four, one, nine.

01:47:15.723 --> 01:47:17.033
Right? Yeah.

01:47:17.033 --> 01:47:17.866
LIAM: Okay.

01:47:19.984 --> 01:47:22.417
All right, So Caleb walks to--

01:47:22.417 --> 01:47:23.677
LAURA: Four, nine, one.
SAM: Four, nine, one.

01:47:23.677 --> 01:47:24.643
LIAM: Four, nine, one.

01:47:24.643 --> 01:47:29.259
To the door with a four on it and opens it.

01:47:30.334 --> 01:47:33.791
As a side note, this is the room that he came to last.

01:47:33.791 --> 01:47:38.161
Opens it, and you guys look in and see

01:47:38.161 --> 01:47:43.161
a very Zemnian-style bed chamber, small,

01:47:43.402 --> 01:47:45.335
the equivalent of a school dorm.

01:47:45.335 --> 01:47:49.333
And there is a bed with all the sheets

01:47:49.333 --> 01:47:52.184
totally messed and twisted and akimbo.

01:47:52.184 --> 01:47:57.184
And books sitting on a wooden desk opened up.

01:47:57.844 --> 01:47:58.877
It's a student's room.

01:47:58.877 --> 01:48:03.844
This is one of the bed chambers

01:48:03.844 --> 01:48:07.260
at the Soltryce Academy.

01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:09.642
MARISHA: Was this yours?
SAM: Like yours?

01:48:09.642 --> 01:48:11.125
LIAM: Uh, no.

01:48:11.125 --> 01:48:11.964
SAM: Oh.

01:48:11.964 --> 01:48:12.797
MARISHA: Hers?

01:48:14.564 --> 01:48:16.354
LIAM: Yes, it was.

01:48:16.354 --> 01:48:18.717
MARISHA: Spend a lot of time in this room?

01:48:18.717 --> 01:48:20.496
SAM: Oh my god.

01:48:20.496 --> 01:48:22.472
LAURA: Did you do that to the sheets?

01:48:22.472 --> 01:48:24.722
(laughter)

01:48:25.574 --> 01:48:26.804
MARISHA: It's a great room, it's great.

01:48:26.804 --> 01:48:28.131
TALIESIN: Is there a view?

01:48:29.984 --> 01:48:34.344
LIAM: The windows are very frosted over,

01:48:34.344 --> 01:48:37.354
so you can't really see through them too well.

01:48:37.354 --> 01:48:41.844
MARISHA: I look down at one of the open books. What is it?

01:48:41.844 --> 01:48:44.315
LIAM: It's a book on illusions.

01:48:46.812 --> 01:48:50.357
MARISHA: Is this active reading,
or is this just set dressing?

01:48:51.634 --> 01:48:52.739
LIAM: No. I flip through it,

01:48:52.739 --> 01:48:54.704
and there are the rudimentary beginnings

01:48:54.704 --> 01:48:57.874
of the illusion school of the arcane

01:48:57.874 --> 01:49:00.854
and the precepts that one must study and learn,

01:49:00.854 --> 01:49:04.612
for a year before getting to the very novice levels

01:49:04.612 --> 01:49:07.120
of being able to weave said illusions.

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.271
MARISHA: But you don't need this.

01:49:10.354 --> 01:49:13.014
LIAM: No.
SAM: But he did at the time.

01:49:13.014 --> 01:49:14.164
MARISHA: So it's set dressing.

01:49:16.584 --> 01:49:18.017
LIAM: It's a memory.

01:49:19.074 --> 01:49:20.424
MARISHA: A good one?

01:49:24.167 --> 01:49:25.108
LIAM: Yeah.

01:49:26.854 --> 01:49:28.554
MARISHA: Are all of these doors memories?

01:49:30.074 --> 01:49:31.624
LIAM: What do you think, Beauregard?

01:49:33.614 --> 01:49:34.964
MARISHA: I think I'm pretty smart.

01:49:38.344 --> 01:49:40.534
LIAM: Let's look at the next room.

01:49:40.534 --> 01:49:42.204
Was it number nine, you said, <i>ja</i>?

01:49:42.204 --> 01:49:44.398
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: One? What was it? Oh yeah, nine.

01:49:44.398 --> 01:49:46.634
LIAM: Four, nine, one.

01:49:46.634 --> 01:49:50.624
I push open nine and as everyone shuffles in

01:49:50.624 --> 01:49:55.554
you instantly recognize the Nestled Nook Inn.

01:49:56.858 --> 01:49:58.194
MARISHA: Aw!
SAM: That's where we met!

01:49:58.194 --> 01:50:00.533
LIAM: It's the tavern room downstairs, yeah.

01:50:00.533 --> 01:50:03.108
MARISHA: Aw!

01:50:03.108 --> 01:50:04.863
TALIESIN: Who's here?
MARISHA: Caleb!

01:50:05.984 --> 01:50:07.684
LIAM: Just us.

01:50:07.684 --> 01:50:10.242
TALIESIN: Anything around? Any paper, any?

01:50:11.244 --> 01:50:12.794
LIAM: I mean, there are flagons

01:50:12.794 --> 01:50:17.544
and half-eaten plates of food and just look--

01:50:17.544 --> 01:50:20.852
LAURA: Is it moldy or does it seem like

01:50:20.852 --> 01:50:21.777
it's a moment in time

01:50:21.777 --> 01:50:23.052
it's not in its--
LIAM: Everything is fresh.

01:50:23.052 --> 01:50:25.273
LAURA: Ah.
LIAM: Made just

01:50:25.273 --> 01:50:26.977
37 minutes ago.
LAURA: Wow.

01:50:28.894 --> 01:50:30.519
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:50:30.519 --> 01:50:34.368
LIAM: This is where we met, Caduceus.

01:50:34.368 --> 01:50:35.355
TALIESIN: Ah.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.673
This is nice.

01:50:39.556 --> 01:50:41.800
LIAM: It is.
LAURA: It would've been better if you were there, too.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.833
TALIESIN: Aw!

01:50:42.833 --> 01:50:46.594
SAM: I mean, it was nice that we met Molly as well.

01:50:46.594 --> 01:50:49.624
LAURA: Sure. Why wouldn't Molly
be able to be there if Caduceus was?

01:50:49.624 --> 01:50:52.640
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Well, I mean.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:53.594
You're right.

01:50:53.594 --> 01:50:54.674
TALIESIN: Thank you.
SAM: I would've--

01:50:54.674 --> 01:50:57.511
They're two separate people, of course.

01:50:57.511 --> 01:50:59.761
(laughter)

01:51:01.924 --> 01:51:03.254
LIAM: Okay, it's going to be dinner soon.

01:51:03.254 --> 01:51:06.337
So you wanted to see room number one?

01:51:08.291 --> 01:51:09.124
(door creaking)

01:51:11.691 --> 01:51:12.524
TALIESIN: Ah.

01:51:14.371 --> 01:51:16.684
LAURA: What is it?
TALIESIN: His home, isn't it.

01:51:16.684 --> 01:51:18.384
LIAM: He just stands there for a while.

01:51:19.699 --> 01:51:21.774
MARISHA: And is it your home, your childhood home?

01:51:24.253 --> 01:51:26.467
LIAM: He doesn't say anything, but walks in.

01:51:28.004 --> 01:51:31.404
And if you follow, you will see a very, very humble,

01:51:35.904 --> 01:51:40.901
small, cottage-style home with a hearth, meager.

01:51:40.901 --> 01:51:42.167
small, cottage-style home with a hearth, meager.

01:51:44.604 --> 01:51:47.491
Poor wooden furniture and

01:51:49.547 --> 01:51:53.287
a shelf with a handful of ragged books on it.

01:51:55.024 --> 01:51:57.099
And a set of wooden stairs leading up to a second floor.

01:51:57.099 --> 01:52:00.315
And a set of wooden stairs leading up to a second floor.

01:52:02.034 --> 01:52:05.504
And I just go and I sit down at the chair

01:52:05.504 --> 01:52:08.150
at the family table.

01:52:12.204 --> 01:52:14.267
LAURA: I go sit down at the table with him.

01:52:16.774 --> 01:52:19.024
This is a nice house, Caleb.

01:52:22.245 --> 01:52:26.797
Do you come up here every time you make the tower?

01:52:27.714 --> 01:52:29.598
LIAM: I have never been in this room.

01:52:29.598 --> 01:52:34.034
I mean, I've been in this room, but

01:52:34.034 --> 01:52:37.322
I've never been in <i>this</i> room.

01:52:38.644 --> 01:52:39.845
MARISHA: How close is it?

01:52:41.634 --> 01:52:46.294
This is a memory more or less, yeah?

01:52:47.504 --> 01:52:49.070
LIAM: This is it.

01:52:51.278 --> 01:52:53.086
LAURA: Why, um.

01:52:54.516 --> 01:52:57.116
Why did you put all this at the top of your tower?

01:53:00.014 --> 01:53:03.004
LIAM: The same reason that the tavern is up here.

01:53:07.554 --> 01:53:09.266
Wherever I go

01:53:13.984 --> 01:53:16.142
they're with me.

01:53:22.464 --> 01:53:24.127
LAURA: They are?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:53:27.094 --> 01:53:28.964
TRAVIS: So funny; they say you can never go home,

01:53:28.964 --> 01:53:33.907
but you've created an ingenious way to do just that.

01:53:36.924 --> 01:53:39.974
MARISHA: But this is your first time being in this room.

01:53:45.214 --> 01:53:47.314
LAURA: This would still be here.

01:53:47.314 --> 01:53:50.114
They would still be here if you didn't make the rooms.

01:53:50.114 --> 01:53:52.205
You know that, though, right?

01:53:58.584 --> 01:54:00.859
LIAM: It's just my way--

01:54:04.692 --> 01:54:05.825
It's just my way.

01:54:07.814 --> 01:54:09.080
TRAVIS: Was your room upstairs?

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.834
LIAM: Mm-hmm. Just the one.

01:54:11.834 --> 01:54:13.550
TRAVIS: Would you mind if I--?

01:54:16.167 --> 01:54:17.000
LIAM: Sure.

01:54:18.764 --> 01:54:22.553
Caleb walks over and looks at the steps

01:54:22.553 --> 01:54:26.444
and places his hand on the rail,

01:54:26.444 --> 01:54:29.977
and skips to the second step

01:54:29.977 --> 01:54:33.114
and it goes (creaking). Smiles a little bit

01:54:34.054 --> 01:54:35.499
and then continues up.

01:54:36.354 --> 01:54:40.687
And it leads to barely more than a loft space.

01:54:42.164 --> 01:54:46.504
There is a single window and there is a simple bed.

01:54:46.504 --> 01:54:50.424
There was two other doors down below, but up here is just

01:54:50.424 --> 01:54:53.734
this little loft and there is a small bed.

01:54:53.734 --> 01:54:56.644
Big enough for a teenager, maybe.

01:54:56.644 --> 01:55:01.214
And a small little circle of rags,

01:55:02.141 --> 01:55:05.199
a perfunctory bed on the floor next to the bed.

01:55:09.771 --> 01:55:10.837
TRAVIS: All to yourself?

01:55:12.132 --> 01:55:13.945
LIAM: (exhales) Almost.

01:55:13.945 --> 01:55:14.778
(foomph)

01:55:17.224 --> 01:55:18.240
MARISHA: Frumpkin?

01:55:31.214 --> 01:55:32.814
LIAM: I've thought about it so much.

01:55:35.979 --> 01:55:37.741
(quietly) I've thought about it so much.

01:55:41.274 --> 01:55:43.604
I don't even know if it's a good idea to have this.

01:55:43.604 --> 01:55:48.527
It probably isn't. But it's just my way.

01:55:58.104 --> 01:56:02.487
I'm just not allowed to forget it.

01:56:04.564 --> 01:56:05.964
TALIESIN: I don't think you ever do.

01:56:08.711 --> 01:56:11.769
I don't think this room would change that.

01:56:13.319 --> 01:56:14.152
And...

01:56:17.192 --> 01:56:21.792
not to speak to how smart you are,

01:56:21.792 --> 01:56:25.583
but I don't think you've figured out

01:56:25.583 --> 01:56:27.934
that you're not supposed to forget, but you're--

01:56:29.517 --> 01:56:31.684
I don't know, not doing it wrong.

01:56:34.264 --> 01:56:38.467
You're not using it the right way, I don't think.

01:56:40.314 --> 01:56:41.764
LAURA: It feels less like a memory

01:56:41.764 --> 01:56:45.397
and more like a punishment for yourself, Caleb.

01:56:45.397 --> 01:56:46.230
TALIESIN: And I'm not--

01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:48.805
LIAM: If it exists here, it exists.

01:56:52.255 --> 01:56:53.357
It exists somewhere.

01:56:54.734 --> 01:56:57.034
TALIESIN: Even without here, it would exist somewhere.

01:56:58.294 --> 01:57:00.570
I know that sounds--

01:57:05.584 --> 01:57:06.947
This is a beautiful place.

01:57:09.414 --> 01:57:12.997
And I hope you know that,

01:57:12.997 --> 01:57:16.223
without the cloud that it brings.

01:57:16.223 --> 01:57:18.587
This is beautiful.

01:57:20.437 --> 01:57:22.434
TALIESIN: But--
LIAM: It is, it is.

01:57:22.434 --> 01:57:23.714
I have those memories.

01:57:23.714 --> 01:57:24.594
I have them.

01:57:27.321 --> 01:57:29.521
I've struggled with it for a very long time,

01:57:31.674 --> 01:57:33.999
my feelings about these things.

01:57:35.732 --> 01:57:37.554
There are good memories,

01:57:37.554 --> 01:57:39.012
but I--

01:57:39.012 --> 01:57:40.853
TALIESIN: It only takes one bad one.

01:57:43.744 --> 01:57:47.567
LIAM: I can't help wanting more.

01:57:51.844 --> 01:57:55.857
SAM: Do you still wish to go back and undo it?

01:57:57.414 --> 01:57:58.889
LIAM: Of course.

01:57:58.889 --> 01:58:02.855
I regret it, I regret-- of course.

01:58:04.488 --> 01:58:06.439
TALIESIN: You think Lucien has a room like this?

01:58:13.784 --> 01:58:15.567
Do you think that's what's happening?

01:58:16.787 --> 01:58:19.307
I don't know, maybe.

01:58:22.702 --> 01:58:27.393
LIAM: Well, I understand that you all

01:58:28.785 --> 01:58:30.764
care for me very much.

01:58:30.764 --> 01:58:32.327
And I am very grateful for it.

01:58:37.974 --> 01:58:41.161
There is a part of me that will not--

01:58:52.692 --> 01:58:54.142
MARISHA: Will not...?

01:58:54.142 --> 01:58:57.486
LIAM: (inhales) So the tour is almost over.

01:58:57.486 --> 01:59:02.384
You wanted to see the ninth floor as well? Come along.

01:59:02.384 --> 01:59:04.424
SAM: Only if it's all right with you.

01:59:04.424 --> 01:59:06.174
LIAM: <i>Ja, ja</i>, it's beautiful.

01:59:06.174 --> 01:59:08.224
SAM: Oh. Okay.

01:59:08.224 --> 01:59:10.542
LIAM: I lead them back up to the central chamber

01:59:10.542 --> 01:59:13.507
and the iris is open.

01:59:15.102 --> 01:59:18.483
MARISHA: After Caleb walks out and after he leaves,

01:59:18.483 --> 01:59:23.227
I just turn and look at Fjord, and then follow.

01:59:25.384 --> 01:59:28.017
TALIESIN: I'd like to be the last.

01:59:28.017 --> 01:59:28.967
MATT: Okay.

01:59:28.967 --> 01:59:30.490
TALIESIN: Just want to leave

01:59:33.223 --> 01:59:34.656
a very, very small,

01:59:38.254 --> 01:59:42.667
very, very small bit of tea on the table

01:59:45.564 --> 01:59:47.139
before closing the door.

01:59:47.139 --> 01:59:47.972
MATT: Okay.

01:59:52.334 --> 01:59:54.884
LIAM: I misspoke. Not locked, but is closed.

01:59:54.884 --> 01:59:57.594
So once we're all together in the center chamber

01:59:57.594 --> 02:00:02.124
I look up at the iris and say: <i>Auf</i>. It goes (whoosh).

02:00:02.124 --> 02:00:03.784
And as soon as that happens

02:00:03.784 --> 02:00:08.784
you see-- almost like you're looking into a sea of stars,

02:00:10.574 --> 02:00:12.994
and we start to float up inside.

02:00:12.994 --> 02:00:17.660
And anyone who dove into the beacon

02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:22.035
will recognize the experience you feel in this room,

02:00:22.035 --> 02:00:23.914
which is all illusion,

02:00:23.914 --> 02:00:25.980
but looking around the room,

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:30.980
you see layer upon layer upon layer of vision.

02:00:31.194 --> 02:00:34.754
And you see your own self.

02:00:34.754 --> 02:00:37.604
Many of you walking along arcs

02:00:37.604 --> 02:00:40.571
and paths and breaking into multiple versions of you.

02:00:41.794 --> 02:00:43.461
SAM: Wow.

02:00:43.461 --> 02:00:44.468
LIAM: And it is--

02:00:46.254 --> 02:00:48.264
you can see the floor and you see a hole

02:00:48.264 --> 02:00:52.437
in this void that we're in, and we're hovering,

02:00:53.684 --> 02:00:55.516
but when you look out to the sides and up,

02:00:55.516 --> 02:00:59.304
it just goes forever and ever and ever.

02:01:03.204 --> 02:01:04.629
Good room to think.

02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:06.695
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: This is incredible.

02:01:06.695 --> 02:01:07.553
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:01:10.458 --> 02:01:12.875
LAURA: (whispering) You guys should--

02:01:14.493 --> 02:01:15.326
SAM: What?

02:01:15.326 --> 02:01:16.837
MARISHA: It's fascinating.

02:01:16.837 --> 02:01:17.670
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:01:20.124 --> 02:01:23.644
MARISHA: The conflicting principles
between those two floors.

02:01:23.644 --> 02:01:24.607
These two floors.

02:01:26.594 --> 02:01:29.887
One dedicated to preserving the past

02:01:33.054 --> 02:01:35.044
exactly how you want it to stay,

02:01:35.044 --> 02:01:37.704
and then the other dedicated to--

02:01:37.704 --> 02:01:40.004
LIAM: Endless possibility.
MARISHA: -- endless possibility.

02:01:43.574 --> 02:01:45.747
LIAM: They don't have to be exclusive.

02:01:45.747 --> 02:01:46.580
MARISHA: No.

02:01:48.747 --> 02:01:51.474
TALIESIN: If it's all right, I'm going to go that way.

02:01:51.474 --> 02:01:53.149
LIAM: Never go that way, never.

02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:55.338
MARISHA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Too late.

02:01:57.196 --> 02:01:58.736
I'm going to see if I can walk a little bit

02:01:58.736 --> 02:02:00.544
and how far before I hit a wall.

02:02:01.734 --> 02:02:04.924
MATT: Not too far, I imagine. (laughs)

02:02:04.924 --> 02:02:06.994
It's like that portion of the elevator

02:02:06.994 --> 02:02:08.344
when you have the mirror on both sides

02:02:08.344 --> 02:02:09.624
and that's the infinite stuff and you're like,

02:02:09.624 --> 02:02:11.101
it's really cool and then (bonk).

02:02:11.101 --> 02:02:13.752
TALIESIN: Bump, bump, bump. Ow.
TRAVIS: The VR cord catches?

02:02:13.752 --> 02:02:15.684
LIAM: It's about the same distance from the entrance

02:02:15.684 --> 02:02:19.294
to the dining room, to the opposite wall.

02:02:19.294 --> 02:02:20.885
TALIESIN: Just going to unsmudge.

02:02:20.885 --> 02:02:22.280
(laughter)

02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:24.304
LAURA: Unsmudge the void.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:02:24.304 --> 02:02:26.487
TRAVIS: Sorry, galaxy.
TALIESIN: Breathed on it.

02:02:26.487 --> 02:02:27.900
SAM: (squeaking)

02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:30.117
TRAVIS: Millions of voices cry out. Ah!

02:02:33.044 --> 02:02:34.397
TALIESIN: Spit polish the universe.

02:02:37.114 --> 02:02:40.104
LIAM: So you are all welcome up here any time you want.

02:02:40.104 --> 02:02:44.028
I'm sure you remember the words to access this chamber.

02:02:44.028 --> 02:02:45.491
SAM: Yes, yeah.

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:47.394
LIAM: I'll only share it one time.
SAM: Sure.

02:02:47.394 --> 02:02:51.494
But we all have Keen Mind, so we'll be okay.

02:02:51.494 --> 02:02:52.873
ASHLEY: What did you say it was again?

02:02:52.873 --> 02:02:56.105
SAM: <i>Auf Wiedersehen Fahrvergnügen.</i>

02:02:56.105 --> 02:02:58.955
ASHLEY: <i>Auf Wiedersehen Fahrvergnügen?</i>
SAM: Yeah.

02:02:58.955 --> 02:03:00.444
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:03:00.444 --> 02:03:01.807
MARISHA: It's very impressive.

02:03:02.924 --> 02:03:04.009
ASHLEY: Amazing.

02:03:04.934 --> 02:03:06.214
MARISHA: It's a lot of things.

02:03:06.214 --> 02:03:09.164
And then it is definitely impressive being one of them.

02:03:09.164 --> 02:03:12.314
SAM: I'm assuming one of those doors was the moment we met,

02:03:12.314 --> 02:03:14.754
because it's such a great memory, but you don't need

02:03:14.754 --> 02:03:16.764
to prove it to me by showing it to me.

02:03:16.764 --> 02:03:18.514
I'm just going to assume that it was.

02:03:18.514 --> 02:03:22.114
MARISHA: I bet doors five and six are super fucked up.

02:03:22.114 --> 02:03:23.147
SAM: Oh boy.

02:03:26.272 --> 02:03:28.072
LIAM: Maybe another day.

02:03:28.072 --> 02:03:30.989
MARISHA: You all have always known me to be blunt.

02:03:32.741 --> 02:03:36.059
ASHLEY: I can't wait to see what's
behind the other doors one day.

02:03:36.059 --> 02:03:37.700
LIAM: (sighs) Dinner.

02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.414
MATT: (laughs)

02:03:40.414 --> 02:03:43.344
MARISHA: As they're leaving I stop Caleb

02:03:45.264 --> 02:03:47.072
after everyone else has left.

02:03:47.072 --> 02:03:48.271
MATT: He's leading the path.

02:03:48.271 --> 02:03:49.837
MARISHA: Well.
LIAM: You'd have to dive after me.

02:03:51.814 --> 02:03:53.450
I'm so fast.

02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:54.884
LAURA: Just dive after him.

02:03:54.884 --> 02:03:56.592
MARISHA: Nevermind, it's gone.

02:03:56.592 --> 02:03:58.610
I'm not diving after you for this shit.

02:03:58.610 --> 02:04:01.634
(laughter)

02:04:01.634 --> 02:04:02.667
MATT: That's friendship.

02:04:05.124 --> 02:04:08.922
SAM: I'm going to just see if there's a 10th floor.

02:04:08.922 --> 02:04:10.043
(laughter)

02:04:10.043 --> 02:04:12.727
SAM: Up. Up!

02:04:12.727 --> 02:04:14.209
MATT: (whooshes)
LIAM: (bump)

02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:16.204
SAM: Ow! All right.

02:04:16.204 --> 02:04:18.422
TRAVIS: You got to speak Zemnian.
SAM: Oh.

02:04:18.422 --> 02:04:20.842
LAURA: Get your smudge off the top of the void!

02:04:20.842 --> 02:04:22.439
SAM: Okay.

02:04:22.439 --> 02:04:24.579
MATT: You bumped into the <i>ceiling</i>,
which now has to be <i>washed</i>!

02:04:27.054 --> 02:04:29.044
As you all drift back down to dinner,

02:04:29.044 --> 02:04:30.964
which you can see, already awaiting.

02:04:30.964 --> 02:04:35.874
there is, at the dining room space, the Tomb Takers who are

02:04:36.994 --> 02:04:41.994
in the process of taking in the coterie of cats

02:04:41.994 --> 02:04:44.914
that seem to be also uncertain

02:04:44.914 --> 02:04:49.914
of them in this odd tense mutual standoff.

02:04:49.914 --> 02:04:52.174
And as you all step in to break the tension

02:04:52.174 --> 02:04:55.694
Lucien glances over. "Perfect timing.

02:04:55.694 --> 02:04:57.227
"I think food's in order."

02:04:58.244 --> 02:05:00.244
As you all begin to take your places to feast

02:05:00.244 --> 02:05:02.182
for the evening, we're going to take a break.

02:05:02.182 --> 02:05:03.644
ALL: Oh!

02:05:03.644 --> 02:05:05.184
MARISHA: Oh, right.
MATT: That's right.

02:05:05.184 --> 02:05:06.560
SAM: Dinner break?
MARISHA: Ah.

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:07.650
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Where am I?

02:05:07.650 --> 02:05:09.075
(laughter)

02:05:09.075 --> 02:05:11.200
TRAVIS: That was a long first half, wasn't it?

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:13.139
MATT: Yeah, went longer than expected, my apologies.

02:05:14.072 --> 02:05:15.324
But it was palpable.

02:05:15.324 --> 02:05:17.711
So we'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up

02:05:17.711 --> 02:05:21.157
for this very interesting evening.

02:05:22.704 --> 02:05:24.897
Stay tuned. We'll see you in a little bit.

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.274
Wow.

02:05:26.274 --> 02:05:27.654
Wow!
You got it in!

02:05:27.654 --> 02:05:28.669
Mad respect.

02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:29.502
Thank you.

02:05:29.502 --> 02:05:30.670
No, Max messaged the rest of us,

02:05:30.670 --> 02:05:33.351
and he was like, she went full Talasin.

02:05:33.351 --> 02:05:34.205
(laughs)

02:05:34.205 --> 02:05:35.160
She went hard low.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:35.993
Yeah.

02:05:35.993 --> 02:05:37.130
That's such a compliment!

02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:38.930
Look, I came with my A game.

02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:40.880
It was early morning.

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:42.930
I had a cup of coffee.

02:05:42.930 --> 02:05:44.170
I was awake.

02:05:44.170 --> 02:05:46.330
I had my CEO brain clickin'.

02:05:46.330 --> 02:05:47.163
(laughs)

02:05:47.163 --> 02:05:49.166
And then I just got kicked in the (beep) teeth.

02:05:49.166 --> 02:05:51.333
(laughs)

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:09.250
No, but the reason why we film separate cameras

02:06:09.250 --> 02:06:10.980
is because it's better for the video.

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:12.479
It's better for the audio.

02:06:12.479 --> 02:06:13.717
It's better...yeah.

02:06:13.717 --> 02:06:17.080
And we have specific overlays made.

02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:19.580
Yeah, everyone wants their own window.

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:21.831
Yeah, it just looks better,

02:06:21.831 --> 02:06:24.303
better audio quality in these weird times.

02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:27.040
What we're not telling folks is that

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:28.870
my screen requires

02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:31.050
so much effects

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:33.550
and airbrushing and

02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:35.730
correction to like a lot of

02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:36.980
Yeah.
my spray tans and...

02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:37.950
Yeah.

02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:39.360
Some of the different stuff, so that--

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.310
There's a blackout in Burbank

02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:44.095
every time we export Talks Machina.

02:06:44.095 --> 02:06:45.521
That's true. That's true.

02:06:45.521 --> 02:06:46.620
(laughs)

02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:49.360
Yeah, I actually have four or five backup cameras

02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.193
above this one in case--

02:06:50.193 --> 02:06:51.620
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:53.940
Couple of generators under the desk.

02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:54.773
I'm ready to go.
It's been good, though.

02:06:54.773 --> 02:06:56.590
We've gotten a lot of work for like all the

02:06:56.590 --> 02:06:58.320
Hollywood render farms that aren't working now,

02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:00.180
thanks to the lockdown, so--
Yes.

02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:01.500
Happy to help out the industry.

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:02.560
This is the only show

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:04.892
on Twitch that records in After Effects.

02:07:04.892 --> 02:07:06.975
(laughs)

02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:14.480
Laura: Hey, critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:16.863
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:21.573
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.280
Hey, look at these!

02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.683
They go on your face!

02:07:30.569 --> 02:07:33.170
Can you put donuts in this?

02:07:33.170 --> 02:07:34.003
I don't know.

02:07:34.003 --> 02:07:35.693
Only one way to find out.

02:07:38.231 --> 02:07:39.620
I mean, the Traveler always says

02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:41.933
impulse purchases are a good decision.

02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:46.250
This is a lot of stuff, you guys.

02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:48.997
We have so many cool things right now.

02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:53.771
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:07:53.771 --> 02:07:54.720
(laughs) Don't worry.

02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:56.280
There's a few more minutes in the break.

02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:57.230
You still got time.

02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:05.630
Taliesin: Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

02:08:05.630 --> 02:08:09.030
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:10.270
Yes.

02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:13.300
That validating and most enthusiastic congregation

02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:15.010
on the other side of

02:08:15.010 --> 02:08:16.840
the fourth wall.

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.140
And what is this

02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:19.250
fourth wall

02:08:19.250 --> 02:08:21.880
separating the viewer from the creator?

02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.720
A portal to an often-sought point of connection?

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:25.553
Or

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.970
the Twitch Subscription Zone?

02:08:29.010 --> 02:08:31.680
On the rare occasion that you miss the live bacchanal

02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:35.540
boasted by the ragtag group of thespians on Thursday night,

02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:37.810
you may always view this show on demand

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:42.500
in the shadowland known as the Twitch Subscription Zone.

02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:43.700
Picture if you will

02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:46.920
the necessary pieces to complete a jigsaw puzzle,

02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.360
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:53.840
You could, of course, subscribe with your debt rectangle,

02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:56.970
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

02:08:56.970 --> 02:08:58.960
Perhaps you found yourself in possession

02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.393
of an Amazon Prime account.

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.040
You would then wake up to discover

02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:06.240
a free Twitch subscription each month

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:08.450
for a channel of your choosing.

02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:11.070
But this artifact demands renewal, for you must

02:09:11.070 --> 02:09:14.733
resubscribe each month to quench its unyielding thirst.

02:09:15.690 --> 02:09:17.690
One need not walk alone.

02:09:17.690 --> 02:09:19.500
Those who have already found their way

02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:21.790
can illuminate the path for others

02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:24.573
via the Gift a Sub button on Twitch.

02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.710
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:32.350
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil of this

02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:33.700
fourth wall.

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:37.330
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:40.180
And so ends another meandering digression,

02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:43.870
a complicated parody-promo down an indistinct highway,

02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:45.210
to the region we call

02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:47.760
the Twitch Subscription Zone.

02:09:56.530 --> 02:09:57.993
You will subscribe.

02:09:59.610 --> 02:10:02.400
Twitch Prime subscribe.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:04.083
Gift subscribe.

02:10:05.981 --> 02:10:07.903
Subscribe!

02:22:37.133 --> 02:22:38.693
MATT: And welcome back.

02:22:38.693 --> 02:22:40.913
So last we left off,

02:22:40.913 --> 02:22:43.803
you all had sat down for your dinner of the evening

02:22:43.803 --> 02:22:47.609
in Widogast's Nein-Sided Tower with the Tomb Takers.

02:22:49.363 --> 02:22:50.196
Is there anything specific

02:22:50.196 --> 02:22:52.586
you want to serve for dinner, Caleb?

02:22:53.513 --> 02:22:56.393
LIAM: Well, there's always a very healthy pastry

02:22:56.393 --> 02:22:58.673
and baking array.

02:22:58.673 --> 02:23:00.413
That's just a permanent fixture,

02:23:00.413 --> 02:23:03.443
but I think we will do...

02:23:03.443 --> 02:23:04.276
elk.

02:23:05.193 --> 02:23:06.477
ASHLEY: Mm.
SAM: Sure.

02:23:06.477 --> 02:23:08.643
LIAM: Yeah, the main dish is elk.

02:23:08.643 --> 02:23:10.986
TRAVIS: Dude, elk is great.
LIAM: And lots of-- yeah--

02:23:11.893 --> 02:23:12.726
and vegetables.

02:23:12.726 --> 02:23:13.559
It's very healthy.

02:23:14.453 --> 02:23:15.903
TALIESIN: Thank you.
LIAM: Baking aside.

02:23:17.667 --> 02:23:18.500
SAM: Great.

02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:20.158
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Sounds delicious.

02:23:20.158 --> 02:23:22.023
LAURA: Let's do some, like, zucchini muffins,

02:23:22.023 --> 02:23:24.653
so that I can still have vegetables,

02:23:24.653 --> 02:23:26.623
in case the vegetables aren't very good.

02:23:26.623 --> 02:23:27.944
MATT: Okay, okay.

02:23:30.053 --> 02:23:32.643
Just that, you know,

02:23:32.643 --> 02:23:35.403
awkward, quiet acknowledgements across the table

02:23:35.403 --> 02:23:39.443
as the hungry rugged Tomb Takers

02:23:41.353 --> 02:23:45.636
try their best at giving pleasantries.

02:23:46.483 --> 02:23:50.876
SAM: As guests, do you lot want to say grace?

02:23:52.943 --> 02:23:55.063
MATT: They all look at each other.

02:23:55.063 --> 02:23:56.420
Otis goes,

02:23:56.420 --> 02:23:57.253
"No."

02:23:57.253 --> 02:23:58.236
SAM: It's tradition.

02:24:00.073 --> 02:24:02.292
Say a blessing for the food, you know,

02:24:02.292 --> 02:24:06.083
based on the being that you worship.

02:24:06.083 --> 02:24:09.323
ASHLEY: And the guest always says the grace.

02:24:09.323 --> 02:24:11.546
MATT: Looks around the other ones, and Lucien goes,

02:24:12.415 --> 02:24:13.481
and Otis goes,

02:24:18.421 --> 02:24:23.421
(guttural speech)

02:24:23.813 --> 02:24:26.551
The eyes go black for a second, then--

02:24:26.551 --> 02:24:29.836
(laughter)

02:24:29.836 --> 02:24:30.994
SAM: Amen?

02:24:31.983 --> 02:24:33.433
ASHLEY: Was that Otis?

02:24:33.433 --> 02:24:34.643
MATT: That was Otis, the halfling.

02:24:34.643 --> 02:24:35.976
LAURA: Do we know what language that was?

02:24:35.976 --> 02:24:37.592
SAM: What god was that?!
MATT: You don't know.

02:24:37.592 --> 02:24:39.013
SAM: Holt shit!

02:24:39.013 --> 02:24:41.513
TALIESIN: I speak Sylvan, Giant, Elvish, and Common.

02:24:41.513 --> 02:24:44.053
MATT: Giant-- then no, you do not.

02:24:44.053 --> 02:24:45.654
TALIESIN: Damn.
ASHLEY: Abyssal and Celestial?

02:24:45.654 --> 02:24:46.736
MATT: Nope.
LAURA: I speak Infernal.

02:24:46.736 --> 02:24:48.096
LIAM: Celestial?
MATT: Nope.

02:24:48.963 --> 02:24:50.338
SAM: Goblin?
MATT: Nope.

02:24:50.338 --> 02:24:51.343
MARISHA: Deep Speech?

02:24:51.343 --> 02:24:52.359
MATT: Deep Speech.

02:24:52.359 --> 02:24:54.942
(laughter)

02:24:55.961 --> 02:24:58.083
MARISHA: What the fuck did he say?
LIAM: And you understand everything now.

02:24:58.083 --> 02:24:59.223
This is-- right?

02:24:59.223 --> 02:25:01.993
MARISHA: That's true, and I can understand spoken tongues.

02:25:01.993 --> 02:25:03.134
MATT: Yeah, yeah, you can.

02:25:03.134 --> 02:25:04.743
MARISHA: Yeah, I need to fucking remember that.

02:25:04.743 --> 02:25:07.510
MATT: So you make out that the gist of this was,

02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:09.871
"Oh, great distant voice,

02:25:09.871 --> 02:25:11.103
come upon this meal

02:25:11.103 --> 02:25:14.908
and let us destroy and devour of its sustenance."

02:25:15.858 --> 02:25:18.270
(laughter)

02:25:18.270 --> 02:25:19.103
SAM: Wow!

02:25:19.103 --> 02:25:22.638
MARISHA: You just see Beau just zone out

02:25:24.109 --> 02:25:25.693
and then slowly eat.

02:25:25.693 --> 02:25:26.954
Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:31.603
They all go into their feasting

02:25:31.603 --> 02:25:33.673
and the quiet persists until--

02:25:33.673 --> 02:25:35.573
LIAM: Oh, I call one cat over.

02:25:35.573 --> 02:25:37.483
Liesel, could you do me a favor

02:25:37.483 --> 02:25:39.633
and go to the back and get just one plate

02:25:39.633 --> 02:25:43.524
of zucchini muffins

02:25:43.524 --> 02:25:47.416
and also some banana nut bread ones as well.

02:25:47.416 --> 02:25:50.086
ASHLEY: (whispers) Also some of those little bugs.

02:25:51.983 --> 02:25:54.373
LIAM: Yeah, we have-- those are permanent now as well,

02:25:54.373 --> 02:25:55.923
so more bugs for the lady.

02:25:55.923 --> 02:25:57.666
ASHLEY: Oh nevermind, Liesel.

02:25:57.666 --> 02:25:58.499
We have enough.

02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:01.483
MATT: (dismissive cat sound)

02:26:01.483 --> 02:26:05.023
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, have you tried yogurt covered bugs?

02:26:05.023 --> 02:26:05.993
ASHLEY: No.

02:26:05.993 --> 02:26:08.283
LAURA: You should, let's try those.

02:26:08.283 --> 02:26:09.116
ASHLEY: Liesel.

02:26:10.366 --> 02:26:12.177
MATT: (inquisitive meow)

02:26:12.177 --> 02:26:14.733
ASHLEY: Can we get, like, a little thing of yogurt?

02:26:14.733 --> 02:26:15.803
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no,

02:26:15.803 --> 02:26:17.333
not like yogurt dipped bugs,

02:26:17.333 --> 02:26:18.983
like yogurt covered bugs.

02:26:18.983 --> 02:26:20.506
Like yogurt covered raisins.

02:26:20.506 --> 02:26:21.489
LIAM: Like hardened.

02:26:21.489 --> 02:26:23.014
ASHLEY: Oh, like a hard yogurt?

02:26:24.103 --> 02:26:27.193
Okay, so take some of the bugs,

02:26:27.193 --> 02:26:32.193
dip them in, and then put them in the fridge,

02:26:32.276 --> 02:26:34.083
the cold box.

02:26:34.083 --> 02:26:34.916
LAURA: You know how to do it.

02:26:34.916 --> 02:26:36.065
Yogurt covered bugs.
ASHLEY: And then they'll harden

02:26:36.065 --> 02:26:38.103
and then it'll be like a little (eating sounds).

02:26:38.103 --> 02:26:40.483
SAM: Fjord, would you like to order anything specific?

02:26:40.483 --> 02:26:42.793
MATT: The cat's head slowly turns towards Caleb

02:26:42.793 --> 02:26:43.853
and just looks at him for a second,

02:26:43.853 --> 02:26:46.535
looks back and goes (petulant meow).

02:26:46.535 --> 02:26:48.566
(laughter)

02:26:48.566 --> 02:26:50.158
ASHLEY: Liesel's a bitch!

02:26:50.158 --> 02:26:53.361
(laughter)

02:26:53.361 --> 02:26:54.503
LIAM: Technically, yes.

02:26:57.096 --> 02:26:59.065
ASHLEY: I like her.

02:26:59.065 --> 02:27:01.656
LAURA: What's your favorite kind of food, Lucien?

02:27:03.143 --> 02:27:05.093
MATT: "Well, to be honest, whatever's warm

02:27:05.093 --> 02:27:07.663
"and I didn't have to pay for."

02:27:07.663 --> 02:27:09.453
LAURA: No, you have to have, like, a favorite.

02:27:09.453 --> 02:27:10.533
That's a boring answer.

02:27:10.533 --> 02:27:12.413
What's your favorite food?

02:27:12.413 --> 02:27:13.505
MARISHA: I agree with that.

02:27:15.763 --> 02:27:19.580
MATT: "Things with, I don't know, spiced cream.

02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:21.643
"I grew up eating bland food.

02:27:21.643 --> 02:27:23.423
"Anything that's interesting."

02:27:23.423 --> 02:27:24.256
LIAM: Where did you grow up?

02:27:24.256 --> 02:27:26.039
Where did all of you grow up?

02:27:26.039 --> 02:27:28.173
What were your lives before this?

02:27:28.173 --> 02:27:29.573
MATT: You see them all look uncomfortable

02:27:29.573 --> 02:27:31.833
and be like (uncertain exhale).

02:27:33.153 --> 02:27:34.013
LIAM: Super culty.

02:27:34.013 --> 02:27:36.276
MATT: (as Lucien) "I don't know if--

02:27:37.383 --> 02:27:39.133
"don't know if this is about sharing

02:27:40.033 --> 02:27:42.453
"personal histories per se.

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:44.763
"I grew up in Shadycreek Run."

02:27:44.763 --> 02:27:45.596
LIAM: All right.

02:27:45.596 --> 02:27:47.739
MATT: "That's about as much as I'd like to talk about."

02:27:47.739 --> 02:27:49.389
TALIESIN: Insight.

02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:51.413
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:27:51.413 --> 02:27:54.266
TALIESIN: Ooh, 22.

02:27:55.223 --> 02:27:56.475
MATT: Seems pretty straight forward

02:27:56.475 --> 02:27:58.783
and pretty much does not want to talk about it.

02:27:59.683 --> 02:28:03.803
SAM: Shadycreek Run, is that near where Mollymauk was--

02:28:03.803 --> 02:28:05.453
MARISHA: That's where we fought Lorenzo.

02:28:06.503 --> 02:28:08.523
SAM: That's sort of interesting.

02:28:08.523 --> 02:28:10.466
That's interesting, isn't it?
TALIESIN: My neck of the woods.

02:28:11.437 --> 02:28:13.053
MARISHA: That's where we met Keg.

02:28:13.053 --> 02:28:14.833
SAM: Well, that's less interesting to Lucien,

02:28:14.833 --> 02:28:17.473
but it's interesting.

02:28:17.473 --> 02:28:18.723
It's just interesting.

02:28:18.723 --> 02:28:21.733
MATT: Otis going off of Lucien's lead,

02:28:21.733 --> 02:28:24.390
seemingly taking that as permission goes,

02:28:24.390 --> 02:28:27.193
"I grew up in Trostenwald.

02:28:27.193 --> 02:28:29.393
"Joined the Orders out of boredom.

02:28:29.393 --> 02:28:33.233
"But now, you know, just curious to see

02:28:33.233 --> 02:28:35.173
"where the road leads now, eh?"

02:28:36.776 --> 02:28:38.773
LAURA: The Orders, does that sound familiar?

02:28:38.773 --> 02:28:39.606
The Orders?

02:28:39.606 --> 02:28:41.261
SAM: The Orders. Yeah, the--
LAURA: Oh, oh, that's right.

02:28:41.261 --> 02:28:42.423
We talked about that.

02:28:42.423 --> 02:28:43.803
SAM: Yeah, that's their little--

02:28:43.803 --> 02:28:45.233
LAURA: Yeah.

02:28:45.233 --> 02:28:46.066
SAM: -- religion.

02:28:48.833 --> 02:28:50.121
MATT: Zoran kind of--

02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:56.373
"Menagerie Coast originally, but

02:28:59.963 --> 02:29:01.556
"not much for friendship,

02:29:02.553 --> 02:29:03.536
"not until these--

02:29:08.813 --> 02:29:11.486
"not until these folks joined."

02:29:11.486 --> 02:29:12.777
MARISHA: Friends?

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:14.463
Would you call them your friends?

02:29:14.463 --> 02:29:17.073
MATT: "Compatriots, I don't do friends."

02:29:17.073 --> 02:29:18.201
MARISHA: Okay.

02:29:18.201 --> 02:29:20.624
TRAVIS: Menagerie Coast, that's where we're from.

02:29:20.624 --> 02:29:21.966
LAURA: We're from the Menagerie Coast!

02:29:21.966 --> 02:29:24.123
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: (deadpan) "Yeah."

02:29:24.123 --> 02:29:24.956
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:29:26.484 --> 02:29:28.873
MATT: There's another awkward pause.

02:29:28.873 --> 02:29:31.223
You can see Cree and Tyffial just like

02:29:31.223 --> 02:29:33.286
not engaging at all.

02:29:35.373 --> 02:29:37.353
The food begins to trickle in

02:29:37.353 --> 02:29:40.553
as the cats begin to come inside

02:29:40.553 --> 02:29:42.713
with some plates of fresh food

02:29:42.713 --> 02:29:45.483
and then the food is an immediate distraction.

02:29:45.483 --> 02:29:48.743
They begin to eat and take that as a way to break

02:29:48.743 --> 02:29:51.256
the eye contact and awkward pauses.

02:29:52.143 --> 02:29:55.767
TALIESIN: So, Lucien, you said

02:29:55.767 --> 02:29:58.534
you grew up in Shadycreek Run.

02:29:59.415 --> 02:30:01.416
Did you ever make it to the Blooming Grove?

02:30:03.273 --> 02:30:07.133
MATT: "I never quite made it up to that far, no."

02:30:07.133 --> 02:30:08.333
TALIESIN: Huh.

02:30:08.333 --> 02:30:09.823
It's a shame.

02:30:09.823 --> 02:30:11.533
I suppose I would have remembered you.

02:30:11.533 --> 02:30:12.591
Got a--

02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:15.103
got a look about you

02:30:15.103 --> 02:30:18.563
and you definitely not quiet about it.

02:30:18.563 --> 02:30:19.933
MATT: "I leave an impression."

02:30:19.933 --> 02:30:20.856
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

02:30:21.953 --> 02:30:23.173
MATT: "But no--"
TALIESIN: That's a shame.

02:30:23.173 --> 02:30:25.353
MATT: "I mean, been up into the forest up there quite a bit,

02:30:25.353 --> 02:30:27.683
"you know, work takes you in strange places

02:30:27.683 --> 02:30:32.488
"but I had no interest in quite making my way to the Grove."

02:30:32.488 --> 02:30:34.333
TALIESIN: Do you have family in the Grove?

02:30:34.333 --> 02:30:37.156
MATT: "(laughs) Don't really have family."

02:30:37.156 --> 02:30:39.491
TALIESIN: Everybody came from somewhere.

02:30:39.491 --> 02:30:41.858
MATT: "Oh, those that wish to remember."

02:30:43.703 --> 02:30:45.203
TALIESIN: Hmm.

02:30:45.203 --> 02:30:46.403
I think those who wish to remember

02:30:46.403 --> 02:30:49.473
and on the other end of that

02:30:49.473 --> 02:30:51.193
is occasionally an unfortunate truth.

02:30:51.193 --> 02:30:53.213
MATT: "You might want to stop prying now and enjoy your meal

02:30:53.213 --> 02:30:55.766
"before it gets unpleasant."

02:30:57.583 --> 02:30:58.833
TALIESIN: I'm having a nice meal.

02:31:02.413 --> 02:31:03.493
ASHLEY: Do you remember--

02:31:03.493 --> 02:31:05.253
well, you don't remember anything, but--

02:31:05.253 --> 02:31:09.229
(clears throat) from your time as Molly, but

02:31:10.543 --> 02:31:13.063
do you remember anything about the circus

02:31:13.063 --> 02:31:16.571
or anybody from Shadycreek that was part of the circus?

02:31:16.571 --> 02:31:20.320
or anybody from Shadycreek that was part of the circus?

02:31:21.213 --> 02:31:22.046
MATT: "No."

02:31:26.223 --> 02:31:28.253
SAM: Who was-- do you--

02:31:28.253 --> 02:31:29.236
was there someone?

02:31:30.133 --> 02:31:31.883
ASHLEY: Well, yeah.

02:31:31.883 --> 02:31:34.200
They all were pretty much

02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:35.532
from Shadycreek.
SAM: Was there one

02:31:35.532 --> 02:31:38.923
that Mollymauk got along with famously?

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:46.526
ASHLEY: I mean, all of them, me?

02:31:47.863 --> 02:31:50.726
Do you remember someone named Gustav Fletchling?

02:31:52.563 --> 02:31:53.396
Fletching?

02:31:53.396 --> 02:31:54.543
Not Fletchling?

02:31:54.543 --> 02:31:55.696
That's something else.

02:31:57.103 --> 02:31:58.833
MATT: "Afraid I haven't heard of him."

02:31:58.833 --> 02:32:00.783
TALIESIN: I know it's useless but insight check.

02:32:00.783 --> 02:32:01.616
MATT: Insight check.

02:32:02.703 --> 02:32:04.411
TALIESIN: 14. I don't even know why I bother.

02:32:04.411 --> 02:32:05.373
MATT: He's hard to gauge.

02:32:06.428 --> 02:32:08.074
ASHLEY: Can I try to do an insight check 'cause--

02:32:08.074 --> 02:32:10.220
MATT: Sure.
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go, Yasha.

02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:11.053
LAURA: Do it.

02:32:11.053 --> 02:32:12.061
MATT: Let's fucking go!

02:32:14.433 --> 02:32:15.266
ASHLEY: 15.

02:32:16.833 --> 02:32:18.223
MATT: He's hard to read.

02:32:18.223 --> 02:32:20.726
At the most you sense he's--

02:32:23.803 --> 02:32:25.343
you get this faintest sense

02:32:25.343 --> 02:32:28.193
he's growing more and more frustrated with the questions.

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:31.903
He's covering it with a smile as he eats,

02:32:31.903 --> 02:32:35.743
but there's-- he's getting a bit shorter.

02:32:35.743 --> 02:32:37.693
TRAVIS: Getting away from the personal stuff,

02:32:39.013 --> 02:32:41.883
are you expecting anyone else to be at Aeor?

02:32:41.883 --> 02:32:43.473
Any other parties that we might have to,

02:32:43.473 --> 02:32:48.053
I don't know, have to work our way around or sneak by?

02:32:48.053 --> 02:32:49.426
SAM: Or is it guarded?

02:32:50.583 --> 02:32:52.571
MATT: "I'm certain there are

02:32:52.571 --> 02:32:54.683
"all sorts of interests wandering those places.

02:32:54.683 --> 02:32:57.853
"There's Empire business finding its way there,

02:32:57.853 --> 02:32:59.083
"there's Dynasty business,

02:32:59.083 --> 02:33:01.903
"there's independent contractors

02:33:01.903 --> 02:33:03.683
"that are just looking to scavenge and takeaway,

02:33:03.683 --> 02:33:07.433
"there's folks from all over, I'm sure.

02:33:07.433 --> 02:33:09.683
"Depending on the day and where you enter from."

02:33:10.593 --> 02:33:11.583
TRAVIS: Well, if we can be of use,

02:33:11.583 --> 02:33:13.573
I mean, is there a particular tactic

02:33:13.573 --> 02:33:14.723
that you wanted to stick to?

02:33:14.723 --> 02:33:16.643
More of the subterfuge side

02:33:16.643 --> 02:33:20.149
or are you a smash and grab fan?

02:33:23.933 --> 02:33:28.113
MATT: "I like to think the tactic will present itself

02:33:28.113 --> 02:33:29.841
"when the time is right.

02:33:30.933 --> 02:33:33.513
"We're kind of improvisers."

02:33:33.513 --> 02:33:36.021
TRAVIS: You'll be glad to hear we are as well.

02:33:36.021 --> 02:33:37.463
MATT: "Mm. Good."

02:33:38.433 --> 02:33:40.783
MARISHA: You mentioned depending on the way you enter.

02:33:41.833 --> 02:33:45.346
So do you know of a back entrance?

02:33:46.243 --> 02:33:49.723
MATT: "We have an entrance that we've used before,

02:33:49.723 --> 02:33:51.103
"last time we came."

02:33:51.103 --> 02:33:53.133
TALIESIN: You've been there before?

02:33:53.133 --> 02:33:54.741
MATT: "Right."
TALIESIN: Ah.

02:33:54.741 --> 02:33:55.574
MATT: "Once before.

02:33:56.543 --> 02:34:01.543
"We're just trying to ensure that

02:34:02.043 --> 02:34:05.784
"our way in hasn't been commandeered."

02:34:09.149 --> 02:34:10.653
SAM: Is it secret?

02:34:10.653 --> 02:34:12.423
Is it a secret way?

02:34:12.423 --> 02:34:13.313
MATT: "As far as I know."

02:34:13.313 --> 02:34:14.146
SAM: Oh.

02:34:14.146 --> 02:34:15.773
MATT: "Seems secret but it's been a while.

02:34:15.773 --> 02:34:16.796
"We'll find out."

02:34:20.431 --> 02:34:22.866
TRAVIS: You know, I do have this map, actually.

02:34:23.783 --> 02:34:25.126
I'll actually take it out,

02:34:27.033 --> 02:34:29.156
show Lucien, if you don't mind.

02:34:30.393 --> 02:34:31.643
It seems like there are mountains

02:34:31.643 --> 02:34:34.363
on the north, east, and southern sides

02:34:34.363 --> 02:34:35.983
of where the city would be located,

02:34:35.983 --> 02:34:39.973
but there's a stretch of land from the west.

02:34:39.973 --> 02:34:41.503
Is there a particular direction

02:34:41.503 --> 02:34:44.083
that you plan to enter from?

02:34:44.083 --> 02:34:45.903
I mean, perhaps so we could take advantage

02:34:45.903 --> 02:34:48.003
of a scouting party or at least, you know,

02:34:49.303 --> 02:34:52.083
see which tactic would be to our advantage.

02:34:52.083 --> 02:34:54.913
MATT: "We happen to have a viable scout on our side,

02:34:54.913 --> 02:34:56.946
"but you have some skilled folk.

02:34:59.193 --> 02:35:00.673
"In the northwestern edge,

02:35:00.673 --> 02:35:02.793
"that's where we first entered."

02:35:02.793 --> 02:35:05.523
TRAVIS: Nice.
LIAM: How long ago?

02:35:05.523 --> 02:35:07.036
MATT: "Number of years."

02:35:07.036 --> 02:35:07.869
MARISHA: Number of years.

02:35:07.869 --> 02:35:09.824
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

02:35:09.824 --> 02:35:11.973
MARISHA: Did you not accomplish what you set out to do

02:35:11.973 --> 02:35:14.706
that last trip?
MATT: "That's when we were hired by

02:35:15.683 --> 02:35:17.320
"the late Vess DeRogna."

02:35:19.424 --> 02:35:20.424
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:35:20.424 --> 02:35:21.383
TRAVIS: And with the map still out,

02:35:21.383 --> 02:35:26.243
I point to the other points, A?, A3.

02:35:26.243 --> 02:35:28.756
Did you happen to already visit all these as well?

02:35:30.433 --> 02:35:32.576
MATT: "No, not all of them.

02:35:33.588 --> 02:35:35.813
"There are a few left unpicked."

02:35:36.743 --> 02:35:39.683
TRAVIS: But not necessary for your needs.

02:35:39.683 --> 02:35:40.833
MATT: "We have what we need."

02:35:42.013 --> 02:35:42.846
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:35:44.893 --> 02:35:46.526
Efficient.

02:35:46.526 --> 02:35:48.491
MATT: "Is there a dessert, by the way?"

02:35:49.525 --> 02:35:51.433
LIAM: That is what we do best here.
LAURA: (laughing) Is there?!

02:35:51.433 --> 02:35:53.124
LIAM: Are you in the mood for something?

02:35:54.083 --> 02:35:55.093
MATT: "Great.

02:35:55.093 --> 02:35:55.993
"I think it's time.

02:35:56.833 --> 02:35:58.083
"Could you get your

02:35:58.083 --> 02:36:00.033
"little kitties to bring us some fine treats,

02:36:00.033 --> 02:36:00.953
"if you don't mind."

02:36:00.953 --> 02:36:01.923
LIAM: Casper, Bruno,

02:36:01.923 --> 02:36:04.462
bring out the final course and then dessert.

02:36:04.462 --> 02:36:06.182
MATT: (trilling meow) And they come out

02:36:06.182 --> 02:36:09.524
and bring out the final spread.

02:36:09.524 --> 02:36:10.842
MARISHA: I just look over at Yasha

02:36:10.842 --> 02:36:13.563
and I go (claps) mockingly.

02:36:15.608 --> 02:36:18.119
MATT: And you glance back and Lucien's looking right at you.

02:36:18.119 --> 02:36:19.261
MARISHA: 'Sup.

02:36:19.261 --> 02:36:21.629
LAURA: (chuckles)

02:36:21.629 --> 02:36:25.649
MATT: Begins to take and eat hungrily of the treats.

02:36:25.649 --> 02:36:27.053
LIAM: One of the larger cats comes in--

02:36:27.053 --> 02:36:28.543
two of the larger cats come in

02:36:28.543 --> 02:36:31.013
and one has got a huge brass tray

02:36:31.013 --> 02:36:33.903
with all kinds of fruit,

02:36:33.903 --> 02:36:34.873
cut fruit on it

02:36:34.873 --> 02:36:36.993
and the other one has a huge basin

02:36:36.993 --> 02:36:38.673
with a fountain of chocolate

02:36:39.813 --> 02:36:40.833
pouring down into it.

02:36:40.833 --> 02:36:43.353
It is a fondue.
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:36:43.353 --> 02:36:45.143
LIAM: Chocolate fondue.

02:36:45.143 --> 02:36:46.743
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh.

02:36:46.743 --> 02:36:49.205
MARISHA: And they're shaped like stars and shapes.

02:36:49.205 --> 02:36:51.613
LIAM: Actually, there are additional small cats

02:36:51.613 --> 02:36:53.743
whose tails are being used to prop up

02:36:53.743 --> 02:36:54.903
the edges of the platters

02:36:54.903 --> 02:36:58.113
so that it doesn't go sideways

02:36:58.113 --> 02:37:00.423
on the big kitties.
LAURA: Nice and strong kitty tails.

02:37:00.423 --> 02:37:02.953
TRAVIS: Nope.
MATT: I would say,

02:37:02.953 --> 02:37:05.093
Beauregard, Caleb, and Caduceus,

02:37:05.093 --> 02:37:07.233
you hear muttering beneath her breath,

02:37:07.233 --> 02:37:08.066
Cree goes,

02:37:09.988 --> 02:37:11.778
"Fucking rich kids."

02:37:12.613 --> 02:37:15.973
TRAVIS: Oh, sure (laughs).

02:37:15.973 --> 02:37:18.143
I hadn't even gone there.

02:37:18.143 --> 02:37:20.805
ASHLEY: I stick my finger in the fountain

02:37:20.805 --> 02:37:23.196
so it stops the flow of the chocolate.

02:37:24.314 --> 02:37:26.463
MATT: It goes, (slurps).

02:37:26.463 --> 02:37:28.483
Your finger is now covered in chocolate.

02:37:28.483 --> 02:37:32.121
MARISHA: Cree, I didn't catch where you were from earlier.

02:37:32.121 --> 02:37:33.836
MATT: "Oh, I'm from all over."

02:37:35.893 --> 02:37:37.603
MARISHA: Do you have, like,

02:37:37.603 --> 02:37:39.821
a place you call home?

02:37:39.821 --> 02:37:41.892
LAURA: Beau, try to ask it without

02:37:41.892 --> 02:37:43.874
seeming like you're making fun of her at the same time.

02:37:43.874 --> 02:37:45.332
TRAVIS: No, we addressed this year ago. It never works.

02:37:45.332 --> 02:37:46.956
MARISHA: It's true, you're right, sorry.

02:37:48.033 --> 02:37:49.906
Is there a place you call home?

02:37:49.906 --> 02:37:51.570
SAM: Oh god.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:37:51.570 --> 02:37:52.873
(laughter)

02:37:52.873 --> 02:37:54.916
TRAVIS: You hear a small scream in the background.

02:37:54.916 --> 02:37:57.903
(laughter)

02:37:57.903 --> 02:37:59.411
LAURA: A glass shatters.

02:38:00.478 --> 02:38:03.043
MATT: That's the equivalent of the Wednesday Addams smile.

02:38:03.043 --> 02:38:04.089
Yep.

02:38:04.089 --> 02:38:06.297
ASHLEY: In Addams Family Values, going (gasps).

02:38:08.433 --> 02:38:10.973
"You look like you're going to a funeral."

02:38:10.973 --> 02:38:11.806
"Wait."

02:38:11.806 --> 02:38:13.595
(laughter)

02:38:13.595 --> 02:38:14.437
Sorry, I love that movie.

02:38:14.437 --> 02:38:15.918
MATT: That movie is fantastic.

02:38:15.918 --> 02:38:17.254
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

02:38:18.285 --> 02:38:19.253
MATT: Cree looks at you back

02:38:19.253 --> 02:38:22.956
with an equal false grin.

02:38:23.873 --> 02:38:26.276
"I'm from a lot of places."

02:38:30.243 --> 02:38:31.910
MARISHA: Yeah, cool. Cool story, yeah.

02:38:33.863 --> 02:38:35.916
MATT: The energy in the room is changing a little bit.

02:38:37.093 --> 02:38:39.453
LIAM: I've never been called a rich kid before.

02:38:39.453 --> 02:38:40.680
TRAVIS: "I'll be the victim."
LIAM: That's new.

02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:42.013
TRAVIS: "All your life."

02:38:43.530 --> 02:38:45.821
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's an odd call.

02:38:45.821 --> 02:38:47.953
ASHLEY: Wait, I did have a question for you, Lucien.

02:38:47.953 --> 02:38:48.786
So,

02:38:51.043 --> 02:38:52.786
wait, do you sleep?

02:38:56.563 --> 02:38:59.226
MATT: "Not in the conventional way."

02:39:00.103 --> 02:39:01.743
ASHLEY: So how do you dream?

02:39:01.743 --> 02:39:03.203
Because isn't that how you--

02:39:03.203 --> 02:39:04.763
isn't that the thing

02:39:05.623 --> 02:39:06.456
with the--

02:39:09.123 --> 02:39:10.816
MATT: "Animals sleep,

02:39:13.133 --> 02:39:15.753
"but minds that have been freed can dream

02:39:15.753 --> 02:39:17.266
"anytime they like.

02:39:19.173 --> 02:39:20.973
"In some ways I'm dreaming right now."

02:39:24.743 --> 02:39:27.386
LIAM: Is that true for the lot of you?

02:39:28.903 --> 02:39:31.033
MATT: They all shift all at once,

02:39:31.033 --> 02:39:32.683
all the heads looking towards you

02:39:33.933 --> 02:39:35.446
in creepy unison.

02:39:37.853 --> 02:39:39.778
"Somewhat,

02:39:39.778 --> 02:39:41.765
"through him."

02:39:44.073 --> 02:39:45.373
MARISHA: You know, Lucien,

02:39:45.373 --> 02:39:46.883
last night you were asking

02:39:47.733 --> 02:39:49.393
if we had any good stories

02:39:51.133 --> 02:39:53.703
and we were a little exhausted from the day,

02:39:53.703 --> 02:39:55.883
but sleeping on it and just

02:39:57.523 --> 02:40:00.266
reflecting on the events that have transpired,

02:40:01.508 --> 02:40:05.375
I was reminded about one of the first outings

02:40:05.375 --> 02:40:07.133
that we all went on as a group.

02:40:07.133 --> 02:40:09.666
You familiar with Yeenoghu?

02:40:12.423 --> 02:40:13.273
You heard of him?

02:40:14.823 --> 02:40:16.336
MATT: "Can't say that I have."

02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:20.331
MARISHA: This demonic entity.

02:40:21.303 --> 02:40:23.723
We found ourselves in Alfield

02:40:23.723 --> 02:40:24.673
and when we got there,

02:40:24.673 --> 02:40:26.303
the entire town was under siege

02:40:26.303 --> 02:40:27.536
by a bunch of gnolls.

02:40:28.883 --> 02:40:30.886
We were asked to investigate it,

02:40:31.833 --> 02:40:36.003
dug deeper and realized these gnolls,

02:40:36.003 --> 02:40:40.636
these wild, chaotic animals,

02:40:40.636 --> 02:40:42.385
these creatures,

02:40:44.203 --> 02:40:48.416
they were formed into an organized cult.

02:40:51.393 --> 02:40:53.803
Didn't really expect it and underestimated them

02:40:53.803 --> 02:40:55.276
to be totally honest,

02:40:56.583 --> 02:40:58.673
tracked them down into this cave

02:40:58.673 --> 02:41:03.659
and gnolls and a few humans all there

02:41:03.659 --> 02:41:05.613
and gnolls and a few humans all there

02:41:05.613 --> 02:41:08.286
and they were worshiping this manticore.

02:41:10.373 --> 02:41:12.373
Feeding villagers to it

02:41:14.273 --> 02:41:16.613
all in the name of this god,

02:41:16.613 --> 02:41:20.576
this higher gnoll demon being.

02:41:23.193 --> 02:41:27.663
Well, we quickly killed the manticore and her cub.

02:41:27.663 --> 02:41:28.762
LAURA: That was sad.
SAM: Oops.

02:41:28.762 --> 02:41:30.513
MARISHA: Yeah, it was actually kind of sad.

02:41:30.513 --> 02:41:32.006
It was a tough choice, yeah.

02:41:35.723 --> 02:41:36.873
Just like that.

02:41:36.873 --> 02:41:37.836
Cult was done.

02:41:39.223 --> 02:41:40.073
Cleared them out,

02:41:42.223 --> 02:41:43.896
rescued some villagers.

02:41:46.458 --> 02:41:48.036
MATT: "Would you say you were heroes?"

02:41:49.173 --> 02:41:50.903
MARISHA: Of Alfield, yes.

02:41:50.903 --> 02:41:52.518
At least for the day.

02:41:53.993 --> 02:41:56.923
But, you know, that was a while ago.

02:41:56.923 --> 02:41:58.093
Time has moved on,

02:41:58.093 --> 02:41:59.526
a war has happened.

02:42:01.943 --> 02:42:06.000
Sure, people have not necessarily forgotten, but--

02:42:08.493 --> 02:42:10.753
MATT: "Tell me this, Beauregard."

02:42:10.753 --> 02:42:11.586
MARISHA: Mm.

02:42:12.962 --> 02:42:14.746
MATT: "Is that the only cult you've killed?"

02:42:22.073 --> 02:42:24.521
MARISHA: Guess it depends on what you define a cult.

02:42:24.521 --> 02:42:27.563
LAURA: (chuckles) (concerned noise)

02:42:27.563 --> 02:42:28.730
TALIESIN: Traveler Con.

02:42:30.993 --> 02:42:31.993
MARISHA: Traveler Con.

02:42:31.993 --> 02:42:33.343
TALIESIN: That's two.

02:42:35.523 --> 02:42:36.883
LAURA: Yeah.

02:42:36.883 --> 02:42:39.933
MARISHA: I would say it is definitely the first cult

02:42:39.933 --> 02:42:41.046
that we've killed.

02:42:43.503 --> 02:42:45.153
Who knows if it'll be the last.

02:42:49.113 --> 02:42:51.451
MATT: "Good story. Thank you for sharing.

02:42:54.953 --> 02:42:56.903
"Well, that's the end of my sweet tooth.

02:42:58.503 --> 02:43:00.076
"I think we'll adjourn for the night.

02:43:01.083 --> 02:43:02.981
"Rest well."

02:43:04.823 --> 02:43:06.243
And he gets up from the table.

02:43:06.243 --> 02:43:07.813
Gathers his coat.

02:43:07.813 --> 02:43:09.933
The others slowly follow suit

02:43:09.933 --> 02:43:11.416
and give a nod.

02:43:11.416 --> 02:43:12.366
Otis goes,

02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:15.216
"Thank you for the meal."

02:43:17.232 --> 02:43:18.065
(Otis grunts)

02:43:18.065 --> 02:43:22.407
And Zoran's like, "Oh. Thank you for the meal. (spits)"

02:43:24.973 --> 02:43:26.743
SAM: It's very gracious of you.

02:43:26.743 --> 02:43:28.466
It's lovely dining with you.

02:43:29.783 --> 02:43:31.113
LIAM: If there's anything else you need in the night,

02:43:31.113 --> 02:43:34.306
there is a red rope pull in your sitting room.

02:43:35.163 --> 02:43:36.113
The cats will come.

02:43:38.333 --> 02:43:40.106
LAURA: They're great to snuggle up with.

02:43:41.103 --> 02:43:41.936
TRAVIS: Or not.

02:43:43.343 --> 02:43:46.203
SAM: No, you can't snuggle with me, no.

02:43:46.203 --> 02:43:47.169
MATT: (as Lucian) "Appreciative."

02:43:48.951 --> 02:43:51.543
And the Tomb Takers make their exit.

02:43:51.543 --> 02:43:54.067
You hear, "Up." "Up." "Up." "Up."

02:43:54.067 --> 02:43:56.600
(laughter)
MATT: And they all begin to drift

02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:58.323
up to the chambers that you had given them earlier.

02:43:58.323 --> 02:44:00.238
TRAVIS: I will set the tone.

02:44:06.273 --> 02:44:07.523
LIAM: Boy, what are we doing?

02:44:08.833 --> 02:44:10.743
LAURA: How many cults have we destroyed?

02:44:10.743 --> 02:44:11.750
TALIESIN: At least two.

02:44:12.703 --> 02:44:16.085
SAM: Well, I mean, there was also
the cults up in Rexxentrum, right?

02:44:16.085 --> 02:44:17.323
LIAM: Obann's little party.

02:44:17.323 --> 02:44:18.723
LAURA: There's also, like--

02:44:18.723 --> 02:44:20.893
MARISHA: There's also like the--
LAURA: -- the cult, the Angel of Irons.

02:44:20.893 --> 02:44:23.543
MARISHA: Yeah, the Angel of Irons, I mean, yeah.

02:44:23.543 --> 02:44:26.283
And then there's Lorenzo's crew, the--

02:44:26.283 --> 02:44:27.273
LAURA: Well, they were all part of that.

02:44:27.273 --> 02:44:29.036
SAM: Were they religious fanatics?

02:44:31.290 --> 02:44:32.223
LIAM: Nah, that was more of--

02:44:32.223 --> 02:44:33.523
MARISHA: Slave traders?

02:44:33.523 --> 02:44:34.859
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's not a cult.

02:44:34.859 --> 02:44:37.217
You got to have your definition.
TRAVIS: Uk'otoa was kind of a process.

02:44:37.217 --> 02:44:39.867
LAURA: That's true, that's true. Uk'otoa.

02:44:39.867 --> 02:44:42.013
TALIESIN: More of a crimes--

02:44:42.013 --> 02:44:43.473
SAM: Unless they're all connected,

02:44:43.473 --> 02:44:44.343
right, Beauregard?

02:44:44.343 --> 02:44:46.456
Maybe they're all one cult.

02:44:47.423 --> 02:44:50.900
MARISHA: That gnoll cult also had visions of hunger.

02:44:52.063 --> 02:44:53.703
It's been a theme.

02:44:53.703 --> 02:44:55.123
I'm not going to say they're connected,

02:44:55.123 --> 02:44:59.073
but it's hard not to look at our time together

02:44:59.073 --> 02:45:04.073
and not see commonality.

02:45:04.251 --> 02:45:05.501
LIAM: What's the hunger here?

02:45:07.303 --> 02:45:08.326
MARISHA: Hunger for power.

02:45:09.813 --> 02:45:12.043
LIAM: That's very universal.

02:45:12.043 --> 02:45:12.876
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:45:14.843 --> 02:45:15.705
TALIESIN: I, uh--

02:45:15.705 --> 02:45:16.655
LAURA: Oh.

02:45:17.903 --> 02:45:19.243
I'm looking through my old notes.

02:45:19.243 --> 02:45:21.893
I was supposed to feed nuts to Nugget.

02:45:21.893 --> 02:45:23.853
That's where I got confused.

02:45:23.853 --> 02:45:25.353
I thought it was for Sprinkle.

02:45:26.763 --> 02:45:27.873
LIAM: So did you kill Sprinkle?

02:45:27.873 --> 02:45:29.623
LAURA: No, Sprinkle's obviously still alive.

02:45:29.623 --> 02:45:30.663
We caught it in time.

02:45:30.663 --> 02:45:32.214
LIAM: So, no peanut allergy or--

02:45:32.214 --> 02:45:33.848
LAURA: No.
LIAM: Okay.

02:45:33.848 --> 02:45:35.983
TALIESIN: Roll for peanut allergy.

02:45:35.983 --> 02:45:37.353
MARISHA: Isn't Nugget a dog?

02:45:37.353 --> 02:45:39.413
LIAM: Jester, sometimes you can

02:45:39.413 --> 02:45:41.453
develop a nut allergy in the middle of your life,

02:45:41.453 --> 02:45:43.823
so you should be careful with Sprinkle.

02:45:43.823 --> 02:45:46.381
LAURA: Oh, well, Sprinkle gets bugs now.

02:45:46.381 --> 02:45:47.881
LIAM: Bugs now?
LAURA: Bugs now.

02:45:47.881 --> 02:45:49.733
LIAM: Okay. Bugsnax?

02:45:49.733 --> 02:45:51.493
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Are we relatively alone?

02:45:51.493 --> 02:45:53.163
Should we go somewhere else?

02:45:53.163 --> 02:45:55.493
Another level to avoid prying ears?

02:45:55.493 --> 02:45:57.054
Does your tower afford that?

02:45:57.054 --> 02:45:59.483
SAM: Well, the iris has closed, right?

02:45:59.483 --> 02:46:01.733
LIAM: I mean, we can distance ourselves,

02:46:01.733 --> 02:46:03.413
but I'm assuming at any given moment

02:46:03.413 --> 02:46:05.913
that we are more likely than not

02:46:05.913 --> 02:46:08.403
to him overhearing us.

02:46:08.403 --> 02:46:10.823
SAM: If you're worried about them overhearing,

02:46:10.823 --> 02:46:12.743
Caleb, may I make a suggestion?

02:46:12.743 --> 02:46:13.576
LIAM: Yeah?

02:46:13.576 --> 02:46:18.048
SAM: Could you command Toto, Sprocket, Legume,

02:46:18.048 --> 02:46:20.731
Filbo, Marta,

02:46:20.731 --> 02:46:22.953
all of your cats

02:46:22.953 --> 02:46:24.993
to start meowing at once.

02:46:24.993 --> 02:46:26.873
Surround us and start meowing.

02:46:26.873 --> 02:46:28.233
LIAM: Those are all your names now.

02:46:28.233 --> 02:46:29.703
Your old names are gone.

02:46:29.703 --> 02:46:30.823
Those are your names.

02:46:30.823 --> 02:46:32.543
MATT: And they all look at you confused. (questioning meow)

02:46:32.543 --> 02:46:33.513
LIAM: I'm sorry.

02:46:33.513 --> 02:46:35.653
SAM: If they all start meowing in unison,

02:46:35.653 --> 02:46:38.233
it will create a cacophony that will be hard to discern

02:46:38.233 --> 02:46:42.720
and we can bunch up together and talk with relative ease.

02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:44.104
TALIESIN: Or we could,

02:46:45.016 --> 02:46:46.643
I don't know, just-- just

02:46:47.673 --> 02:46:49.042
talk or chat--

02:46:49.042 --> 02:46:51.043
TRAVIS: I was only going to ask.

02:46:51.043 --> 02:46:53.553
I seem to be hiding my lust for a fight

02:46:53.553 --> 02:46:55.683
better than Beauregard was at dinner,

02:46:55.683 --> 02:46:58.683
but does your tower provide any sort of tactical advantage

02:46:58.683 --> 02:47:01.292
in this sense? And two, should we contact Essek

02:47:01.292 --> 02:47:04.733
and figure out what part of Aeor he is stationed on

02:47:04.733 --> 02:47:07.338
since we seem to be approaching towards the Northwest?

02:47:07.338 --> 02:47:09.056
LIAM: Well, if we are trying to--

02:47:11.410 --> 02:47:12.713
if we are trying to separate ourselves,

02:47:12.713 --> 02:47:14.813
we could go to the eighth and ninth floor.

02:47:17.823 --> 02:47:20.456
Although I suppose he could have
heard me speaking in Zemnian

02:47:20.456 --> 02:47:21.623
and remembered the Zemnian,

02:47:21.623 --> 02:47:25.906
but that's the only thing I can think of.

02:47:27.263 --> 02:47:28.543
TALIESIN: I suppose that we would know

02:47:28.543 --> 02:47:30.023
if they were wandering around anyway

02:47:30.023 --> 02:47:31.378
'cause the cats would tell us.

02:47:31.378 --> 02:47:32.583
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:47:32.583 --> 02:47:34.936
I kind of like this cat idea.

02:47:36.243 --> 02:47:38.593
If I'm going to be honest, let's--

02:47:38.593 --> 02:47:40.393
TALIESIN: Just trying to think of Fjord--

02:47:40.393 --> 02:47:41.411
LIAM: Let me adjust it.

02:47:41.411 --> 02:47:43.006
Let's meet in--

02:47:45.443 --> 02:47:47.482
let's return to the--

02:47:47.482 --> 02:47:50.132
hmm, the salon or the ninth floor is the question.

02:47:52.093 --> 02:47:53.103
Let's go to the salon.

02:47:53.103 --> 02:47:54.643
TALIESIN: I think the salon is the right choice.

02:47:54.643 --> 02:47:56.332
SAM: To the salon!

02:47:56.332 --> 02:47:58.737
(laughter)

02:47:58.737 --> 02:47:59.913
TRAVIS: Up!

02:47:59.913 --> 02:48:01.803
(laughter)

02:48:01.803 --> 02:48:03.036
SAM: Throat's closing up there, Fjord.

02:48:03.036 --> 02:48:05.872
TRAVIS: It is. It genuinely makes my throat tingle.

02:48:05.872 --> 02:48:07.253
LIAM: It's actually one floor down

02:48:07.253 --> 02:48:08.683
and I sort of have a downward--

02:48:08.683 --> 02:48:09.745
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:48:09.745 --> 02:48:11.728
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Down!

02:48:11.728 --> 02:48:13.153
SAM: (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) Down!

02:48:14.653 --> 02:48:16.853
MATT: All right. As you all gather into the salon.

02:48:16.853 --> 02:48:18.183
LIAM: Okay and I will pull--

02:48:18.183 --> 02:48:21.513
I will walk over to the large, ornate fireplace in the salon

02:48:21.513 --> 02:48:26.343
on the first tier of the three-tiered library salon

02:48:26.343 --> 02:48:28.946
and I will pull the red rope,

02:48:28.946 --> 02:48:32.066
plush pull by the fireplace and

02:48:33.376 --> 02:48:36.673
cats appear at little cubby hole entrances

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:38.033
all around the salon.

02:48:38.033 --> 02:48:40.163
Probably a hundred of them.

02:48:40.163 --> 02:48:43.585
And I just say: In the key of G.

02:48:43.585 --> 02:48:46.655
And then all of them start to go (melodic meows)

02:48:46.655 --> 02:48:48.363
and melody weaves.

02:48:48.363 --> 02:48:49.563
They don't all start at once.

02:48:49.563 --> 02:48:51.373
It's sort of like row, row, row your boat-ing

02:48:51.373 --> 02:48:53.823
around the walls
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:56.843
LIAM: And there is just a low key

02:48:56.843 --> 02:48:58.824
cat melody happening now

02:48:58.824 --> 02:49:00.373
and there's no silence.

02:49:00.373 --> 02:49:01.915
MATT: All righty.

02:49:01.915 --> 02:49:04.913
ASHLEY: ♪ Meow Mix Meow Mix, please deliver ♪

02:49:04.913 --> 02:49:06.093
LIAM: Come on, this is serious.

02:49:06.093 --> 02:49:09.918
It's less staccato and more elongated haunting yowling.

02:49:09.918 --> 02:49:11.751
It's less staccato and more elongated haunting yowling.

02:49:11.751 --> 02:49:14.782
(various yowling sounds)

02:49:14.782 --> 02:49:18.193
MATT: It's a semi-melodic

02:49:18.193 --> 02:49:20.876
in heat evening call in chorus.

02:49:20.876 --> 02:49:22.115
LAURA: Wow, they're going to think

02:49:22.115 --> 02:49:23.848
so many cats are fucking down here.

02:49:23.848 --> 02:49:25.333
(laughter)

02:49:25.333 --> 02:49:27.143
TRAVIS: So again, not that we would ever need to

02:49:27.143 --> 02:49:29.871
and perhaps we might tomorrow evening,

02:49:29.871 --> 02:49:31.653
is this place suited for fighting?

02:49:31.653 --> 02:49:33.583
Can it be damaged and could they escape?

02:49:33.583 --> 02:49:34.870
Could we trap them in a single level?

02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:36.530
ASHLEY: I can't here you over the--

02:49:37.648 --> 02:49:39.545
TRAVIS: (louder) Could we trap them--

02:49:39.545 --> 02:49:40.393
LAURA: Real close, real close.

02:49:40.393 --> 02:49:41.646
TALIESIN: Keep it down, come on.

02:49:42.933 --> 02:49:44.663
MARISHA: Heads in, heads in.
TALIESIN: Heads in, heads in.

02:49:44.663 --> 02:49:45.563
SAM: I don't think that--

02:49:45.563 --> 02:49:48.751
I mean, unless I'm mistaken, Caleb,

02:49:48.751 --> 02:49:49.903
this place doesn't have

02:49:49.903 --> 02:49:53.803
any particular armaments or anything, does it?

02:49:53.803 --> 02:49:56.793
LIAM: Well, you can play around a bit on the floor below us,

02:49:56.793 --> 02:49:59.073
but if you're wondering if you can fight here,

02:49:59.073 --> 02:50:01.413
you don't have to worry about damaging anything

02:50:01.413 --> 02:50:04.743
because it all resets to my liking.

02:50:04.743 --> 02:50:05.753
TRAVIS: Yeah, I meant more like,

02:50:05.753 --> 02:50:07.223
could we trap them on a floor,

02:50:07.223 --> 02:50:09.003
keep them from leaving

02:50:09.003 --> 02:50:12.413
and then restricting the entrance and exit out of the room.

02:50:12.413 --> 02:50:13.423
LAURA: Anything that happens,

02:50:13.423 --> 02:50:15.471
I mean, he could cancel this tower.

02:50:15.471 --> 02:50:16.883
TALIESIN: He can make the tower disappear.

02:50:16.883 --> 02:50:19.531
LIAM: Well, I don't know if he can change.

02:50:19.531 --> 02:50:22.039
Here's the thing, right now there is not

02:50:22.039 --> 02:50:24.093
but tomorrow night there will be,

02:50:24.093 --> 02:50:25.113
if we imagine it.

02:50:25.113 --> 02:50:26.213
TRAVIS: That's what I meant.

02:50:28.633 --> 02:50:29.733
Just a thought.

02:50:29.733 --> 02:50:30.566
TALIESIN: What?

02:50:32.268 --> 02:50:35.663
SAM: Like one of those irises has a locking mechanism or--

02:50:35.663 --> 02:50:36.756
LIAM: Well, I can fiddle, yeah.

02:50:37.663 --> 02:50:38.673
MARISHA: I like this.

02:50:38.673 --> 02:50:42.543
SAM: Another idea, as we approach the entrance to A1,

02:50:42.543 --> 02:50:44.673
if we needed to buy some time or something,

02:50:44.673 --> 02:50:48.503
we could-- I mean, we have Dagen.

02:50:48.503 --> 02:50:52.833
Dagen's on our tail so he could create a diversion

02:50:52.833 --> 02:50:54.974
or blow something up

02:50:54.974 --> 02:50:58.370
or fire a crossbow bolt from far off

02:50:58.370 --> 02:51:00.293
and that might slow us down

02:51:00.293 --> 02:51:01.233
if we're trying to buy time

02:51:01.233 --> 02:51:03.213
for Essek to arrive or something.

02:51:03.213 --> 02:51:04.046
TRAVIS: That's true. Even though

02:51:04.046 --> 02:51:05.304
the cats are singing beautifully

02:51:05.304 --> 02:51:06.233
I will summon the sword,

02:51:06.233 --> 02:51:09.183
and I will cast See Invisibility
just as an extra precaution.

02:51:09.183 --> 02:51:10.733
MATT: Okay, make an perception check.

02:51:10.733 --> 02:51:12.033
TRAVIS: Whoop.

02:51:12.033 --> 02:51:13.123
15.

02:51:13.123 --> 02:51:14.436
MATT: 15, okay, cool.

02:51:15.863 --> 02:51:17.433
Glancing around the chamber

02:51:17.433 --> 02:51:20.433
surrounded by cats, you immediately--

02:51:22.816 --> 02:51:24.143
and you glance up

02:51:24.143 --> 02:51:25.673
and right above you guys,

02:51:25.673 --> 02:51:30.145
you see a faintly visible arcane orb.

02:51:30.145 --> 02:51:32.353
MARISHA: Motherfucker!
SAM: Motherfucker!

02:51:32.353 --> 02:51:35.043
TRAVIS: (whistles, clicks tongue)

02:51:35.043 --> 02:51:35.876
Mm-mm.

02:51:39.298 --> 02:51:41.244
TALIESIN: Biding our time seems to be--

02:51:45.803 --> 02:51:46.636
see where we end up.

02:51:46.636 --> 02:51:50.076
TRAVIS: I mean, they have actually been quite nice.

02:51:51.803 --> 02:51:53.873
I thought they would have tried something at this point,

02:51:53.873 --> 02:51:58.873
but perhaps all our judgments were misplaced.

02:52:00.233 --> 02:52:02.897
SAM: You view them as allies now, do you, Fjord?

02:52:02.897 --> 02:52:05.018
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know about that

02:52:05.018 --> 02:52:08.753
but they seem to be at least participating

02:52:08.753 --> 02:52:10.066
in their half of the deal.

02:52:15.333 --> 02:52:19.263
LIAM: Well, they've been listening to us shit talk them

02:52:19.263 --> 02:52:21.436
quite a bit on multiple nights.

02:52:22.653 --> 02:52:27.653
So I don't think there's a lot of illusions here.

02:52:29.213 --> 02:52:33.736
It's an uncomfortable alliance at best,

02:52:35.213 --> 02:52:39.466
but we're curious to see the end of the road.

02:52:42.283 --> 02:52:44.203
You can stop singing.

02:52:44.203 --> 02:52:45.036
You can stop singing.

02:52:45.036 --> 02:52:46.115
Cut it, cut it.

02:52:46.115 --> 02:52:47.283
MATT: (cut off meows)

02:52:47.283 --> 02:52:48.993
All cuts and they look at each other, confused,

02:52:48.993 --> 02:52:50.293
and then they slowly begin to

02:52:50.293 --> 02:52:51.763
filter out of the room through the--

02:52:51.763 --> 02:52:52.840
SAM: Yeah, you guys blew it.

02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:53.839
You blew it.

02:52:53.839 --> 02:52:54.707
Get out of here!

02:52:54.707 --> 02:52:56.498
MARISHA: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Prima donna cat's still going.

02:52:56.498 --> 02:52:58.587
MATT: (musical meowing)

02:52:58.587 --> 02:53:00.045
(laughter)

02:53:00.045 --> 02:53:02.970
SAM: ♪ Memories ♪

02:53:02.970 --> 02:53:04.403
MATT: It would be Memories,

02:53:04.403 --> 02:53:05.853
it would be fucking Memories.

02:53:07.403 --> 02:53:09.653
LIAM: Yeah, you, Root, stop.

02:53:09.653 --> 02:53:11.024
Could you bring some whiskeys down?

02:53:11.024 --> 02:53:12.665
Thank you.
MATT: (affirmative meowing)

02:53:15.273 --> 02:53:16.106
LAURA: Still there?

02:53:17.971 --> 02:53:19.095
MATT: They're still there.

02:53:20.163 --> 02:53:22.216
SAM: Well, good night, then, I guess.

02:53:23.066 --> 02:53:24.563
LAURA: Ooh, I wonder who it's following?

02:53:24.563 --> 02:53:26.253
Everybody

02:53:26.253 --> 02:53:28.016
take 10 steps back.

02:53:29.163 --> 02:53:30.473
SAM: Okay.

02:53:30.473 --> 02:53:31.306
Does it follow?

02:53:31.306 --> 02:53:33.695
I think it's just stationary, isn't it?

02:53:33.695 --> 02:53:35.313
LAURA: It might follow a certain person.

02:53:35.313 --> 02:53:37.085
We could see who its actually scrying on.
LIAM: Jester, walk across

02:53:37.085 --> 02:53:38.956
to the far side of the salon.

02:53:39.818 --> 02:53:41.553
MARISHA: We walk to opposite points.

02:53:41.553 --> 02:53:42.940
LAURA: Yeah, everybody walks--

02:53:44.013 --> 02:53:44.913
MATT: Opposite spaces?

02:53:46.033 --> 02:53:48.935
No, you can see now it is following Yasha.

02:53:48.935 --> 02:53:49.768
TALIESIN: Huh.

02:53:51.301 --> 02:53:52.134
TRAVIS: I knew it.

02:53:52.134 --> 02:53:52.967
She dies.

02:53:56.303 --> 02:53:58.106
SAM: Wow, special.

02:53:59.193 --> 02:54:00.614
TRAVIS: Angel.

02:54:00.614 --> 02:54:01.447
ASHLEY: (whispers) Hey!

02:54:01.447 --> 02:54:02.418
LIAM: Angel blood.

02:54:02.418 --> 02:54:03.501
ASHLEY: Go to bed.

02:54:03.501 --> 02:54:05.710
(laughter)

02:54:07.205 --> 02:54:08.998
ASHLEY: It's probably just 'cause--

02:54:10.083 --> 02:54:11.413
LAURA: Maybe it's because he feels something for you.

02:54:11.413 --> 02:54:14.223
ASHLEY: Maybe he remembers me?

02:54:14.223 --> 02:54:15.667
SAM: Oh!

02:54:15.667 --> 02:54:17.273
ASHLEY: (sighs) I don't know.

02:54:17.273 --> 02:54:18.743
Again, that's that thing--

02:54:18.743 --> 02:54:19.803
what is it again? Hope?

02:54:19.803 --> 02:54:20.963
That I keep holding onto?

02:54:20.963 --> 02:54:22.463
SAM: That's good, though.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:54:23.791 --> 02:54:25.241
LAURA: Is it still there?

02:54:27.873 --> 02:54:30.353
MATT: You see, over a few more minutes, it vanishes

02:54:31.883 --> 02:54:32.983
and then it reappears,

02:54:33.913 --> 02:54:35.096
this time above Fjord.

02:54:36.473 --> 02:54:38.096
SAM: Well, shit.

02:54:39.643 --> 02:54:40.736
LAURA: Interesting.

02:54:43.743 --> 02:54:45.856
LIAM: I walk over towards Fjord.
MATT: Yes, above Fjord.

02:54:45.856 --> 02:54:46.973
LIAM: I walk over towards you,

02:54:46.973 --> 02:54:48.649
I look up at it.

02:54:48.649 --> 02:54:51.673
Actually, I stand in front of you

02:54:51.673 --> 02:54:53.403
so I can get in this view.

02:54:53.403 --> 02:54:56.493
I'm assuming it's just like fisheye lens.

02:54:56.493 --> 02:54:57.573
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: And looks at him.

02:54:57.573 --> 02:54:58.653
SAM: It's a ring light.

02:54:58.653 --> 02:55:00.933
LIAM: What are we going to do here?

02:55:00.933 --> 02:55:02.096
We're working together.

02:55:03.623 --> 02:55:04.913
You don't really trust us,

02:55:04.913 --> 02:55:07.163
we don't really trust you.

02:55:07.163 --> 02:55:09.663
You have some idea of what you want to do with us.

02:55:10.793 --> 02:55:12.416
We feel compelled to follow.

02:55:15.337 --> 02:55:17.037
Are you having fun at least?

02:55:18.025 --> 02:55:19.466
MATT: (whooshes) It vanishes.

02:55:21.703 --> 02:55:23.623
TRAVIS: You were actually looking just off camera

02:55:23.623 --> 02:55:27.413
but it doesn't really matter.

02:55:27.413 --> 02:55:28.710
LIAM: Messing with his mind.

02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:30.960
LAURA: (laughs)

02:55:32.183 --> 02:55:34.113
TALIESIN: Always a conversation with the Wild Mother.

02:55:34.113 --> 02:55:35.073
TRAVIS: I'll wait a minute.

02:55:35.073 --> 02:55:36.676
Does it reappear in the room?

02:55:38.502 --> 02:55:40.223
MATT: Mm-mm.

02:55:40.223 --> 02:55:42.423

The Traveler peeks into your ear and goes,

"I'm going to be honest.

Huh.

02:57:06.253 --> 02:57:07.086
I'd say,

02:57:11.853 --> 02:57:16.853
I suppose any sort of advantage going into where we--

TALIESIN: Thank you, that's all I needed.

02:57:52.953 --> 02:57:54.283
I would like this--

02:57:54.283 --> 02:57:57.873
my Divine Intervention is I want this entrance,

02:57:57.873 --> 02:58:01.153
the side entrance to be closed.

02:58:01.153 --> 02:58:05.153
To be-- the secondary sneaky entrance,

02:58:05.153 --> 02:58:07.313
I want it destroyed.
MATT: Interesting.

02:58:07.313 --> 02:58:09.013
Okay, go ahead and give it a shot.

02:58:10.643 --> 02:58:12.155
LIAM: Zig-a-zig-ah.

02:58:12.155 --> 02:58:14.969
TALIESIN: That's a 39.

02:58:14.969 --> 02:58:16.040
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:17.443
TALIESIN: Nah, it was worth a shot.

02:58:17.443 --> 02:58:19.033
MATT: It was worth a shot, worth a shot.

02:58:19.033 --> 02:58:21.801
TALIESIN: There's Commune and then there's also,

02:58:21.801 --> 02:58:24.234
worst case scenario we can just--

02:58:25.365 --> 02:58:26.337
SAM: What's that?

02:58:26.337 --> 02:58:27.170
Oh.

02:58:28.293 --> 02:58:29.436
TALIESIN: Super quick.

02:58:30.393 --> 02:58:32.827
LIAM: You could be asking me so many things, Taliesin.

02:58:32.827 --> 02:58:33.803
TRAVIS: (laughs) I know.

02:58:33.803 --> 02:58:34.913
TALIESIN: I don't want to say it out loud.

02:58:34.913 --> 02:58:38.633
We could just recall back to Jester's house

02:58:38.633 --> 02:58:39.578
one of these days.

02:58:39.578 --> 02:58:40.850
LIAM: Mm-hmm. Super.

02:58:40.850 --> 02:58:41.759
Bail.

02:58:41.759 --> 02:58:43.199
LAURA: (whispering) We could just go.

02:58:43.199 --> 02:58:44.633
TALIESIN: At any time.

02:58:44.633 --> 02:58:45.833
That's always an option.

02:58:47.113 --> 02:58:48.793
TRAVIS: Should we check in with Essek?

02:58:49.913 --> 02:58:51.593
LAURA: Sure, I can send a message.

02:58:51.593 --> 02:58:52.893
SAM: Are we being watched?

02:58:52.893 --> 02:58:56.123
LAURA: Well, he's still got it up for another hour.

02:58:56.123 --> 02:58:57.043
MATT: At this point it'd be about,

02:58:57.043 --> 02:58:58.233
I'd say 30 or more,

02:58:58.233 --> 02:59:01.673
30 minutes or so left of the spell.

02:59:01.673 --> 02:59:03.593
LAURA: All right, yeah, then I'll send a message to Essek.

02:59:03.593 --> 02:59:05.137
What should I say? What should I say?

02:59:05.137 --> 02:59:06.253
What should I say?

02:59:06.253 --> 02:59:07.123
This is important.
MARISHA: Where he is.

02:59:07.123 --> 02:59:09.423
SAM: We're going to be at Aeor in a day and a half.

02:59:09.423 --> 02:59:10.293
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:59:10.293 --> 02:59:11.723
SAM: Meet us there.

02:59:11.723 --> 02:59:13.403
MARISHA: He was already there.

02:59:13.403 --> 02:59:14.743
He was on the east side of--

02:59:14.743 --> 02:59:16.085
SAM: Like, meet us at the entrance.

02:59:16.085 --> 02:59:17.372
LAURA: There's so many entrances.

02:59:17.372 --> 02:59:19.046
It's not like-- it's a city.

02:59:19.046 --> 02:59:21.573
It's not like there one place to go into it.

02:59:21.573 --> 02:59:23.093
TRAVIS: I mean, do we--
LIAM: He's on one side of the Grand Canyon

02:59:23.093 --> 02:59:23.926
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Do we want to

02:59:23.926 --> 02:59:27.551
complicate our arrival and lay a trap

02:59:27.551 --> 02:59:30.673
or just make sure he stays clear?

02:59:30.673 --> 02:59:33.363
SAM: I think maybe clear and follow us in?

02:59:33.363 --> 02:59:35.563
MARISHA: He has so much other shit going on.

02:59:35.563 --> 02:59:38.093
How are we going to convince him to do that?

02:59:38.093 --> 02:59:39.343
SAM: He loves us!

02:59:39.343 --> 02:59:41.093
He is one of the Mighty Nein!

02:59:41.093 --> 02:59:42.703
MARISHA: He told us the last time we talked,

02:59:42.703 --> 02:59:45.181
he was like, "I am running an operation

02:59:45.181 --> 02:59:47.443
"for the Dynasty.

02:59:47.443 --> 02:59:49.353
"I cannot abandon my post.

02:59:49.353 --> 02:59:50.473
"I am in charge here."

02:59:50.473 --> 02:59:51.462
That is what he said.

02:59:51.462 --> 02:59:52.678
TALIESIN: I think that he'll understand

02:59:52.678 --> 02:59:54.613
that this is bigger than that.

02:59:54.613 --> 02:59:56.273
TRAVIS: They've collected lodestones.

02:59:56.273 --> 02:59:57.603
They have prior knowledge.

02:59:57.603 --> 02:59:59.303
They're coming to awaken the city.

02:59:59.303 --> 03:00:00.283
TALIESIN: I need a third question.

03:00:00.283 --> 03:00:01.468
TRAVIS: Wait for us.

03:00:01.468 --> 03:00:04.114
LIAM: That's a big question mark with him, because he--

03:00:04.114 --> 03:00:04.998
MARISHA: It's a huge question mark.

03:00:04.998 --> 03:00:06.098
LIAM: He has told us to our faces

03:00:06.098 --> 03:00:08.463
that he bears more allegiance to us

03:00:08.463 --> 03:00:10.023
than any nation.

03:00:10.023 --> 03:00:11.923
Whether that's true or not, who knows?

03:00:12.770 --> 03:00:14.730
LIAM: Who knows what his allegiances are?

03:00:14.730 --> 03:00:19.550
MARISHA: If anything, I think
if we utilize Essek in any way,

03:00:19.550 --> 03:00:22.490
he will be a tool because there's no doubt

03:00:22.490 --> 03:00:23.765
that he's not going to have some sort of

03:00:23.765 --> 03:00:26.389
common interest in whatever they want.

03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:30.560
TRAVIS: Right, are you proposing that he help us keep them

03:00:30.560 --> 03:00:32.803
from going in or to follow us in?

03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:37.580
On the sleeky.

03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:38.580
LIAM: You are right there.

03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:41.945
I mean, think of what he did for knowledge already.

03:00:41.945 --> 03:00:44.709
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Just for research.

03:00:44.709 --> 03:00:46.190
MARISHA: I think it's kind of--

03:00:46.190 --> 03:00:47.623
LIAM: We kiss him into this.

03:00:49.391 --> 03:00:52.620
MARISHA: He could work, like
throwing two Kaiju at each other

03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:56.445
and seeing how they battle and you know, I don't know.

03:00:56.445 --> 03:00:57.720
TRAVIS: We could also tell him all this

03:00:57.720 --> 03:00:59.190
and he may just totally disregard it.

03:00:59.190 --> 03:01:01.686
LAURA: We could also--
MARISHA: Yeah, that, too.

03:01:01.686 --> 03:01:04.150
LAURA: --also Polymorph really fast

03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:07.190
and fly away and just go.

03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:08.460
TRAVIS: Right now?

03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:09.760
LAURA: Just right now.

03:01:11.290 --> 03:01:13.280
MARISHA: Go where?

03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:14.480
Go to A1?

03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:19.480
LAURA: Go to Essek, go now, abandon them, just go.

03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:25.620
TALIESIN: In less than an hour.

03:01:25.620 --> 03:01:27.741
SAM: That would be highly risky.

03:01:27.741 --> 03:01:28.970
TRAVIS: (chuckles) Oh, yeah.

03:01:28.970 --> 03:01:32.070
TALIESIN: Oh, wow, it would actually
the more I think about it.

03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:33.336
LIAM: Well...

03:01:33.336 --> 03:01:34.660
TALIESIN: Yeah, once we're out, we're out.

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:35.690
LIAM: Come closer.

03:01:35.690 --> 03:01:37.917
TRAVIS: Uh huh. I'm looking out--

03:01:37.917 --> 03:01:39.125
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:01:40.986 --> 03:01:42.483
TRAVIS: 16.

03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:44.887
MATT: Looks fairly clear at the moment.

03:01:44.887 --> 03:01:47.680
TRAVIS: Yeah, leaving is perhaps not--

03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:51.130
TRAVIS: Fairly clear, be advised, <i>fairly</i> clear.

03:01:51.130 --> 03:01:53.010
MATT: You look around the chamber and feel pretty confident

03:01:53.010 --> 03:01:55.360
with what you've seen before that
you do not see it around you.

03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:57.183
TRAVIS: <i>Pretty</i> confident.

03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:59.163
LIAM: Be advised.

03:01:59.163 --> 03:02:00.680
LIAM: If you have a third question, though,

03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:01.647
I've got a couple in mind.

03:02:01.647 --> 03:02:02.720
LIAM: No, I don't have a question,

03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:06.513
but just piggybacking on that,

03:02:07.970 --> 03:02:09.550
everybody except for Veth and I

03:02:09.550 --> 03:02:13.960
are going to be tired tomorrow.

03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:14.793
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:02:14.793 --> 03:02:18.081
LIAM: We could wake up in the middle of the night.

03:02:19.251 --> 03:02:21.067
(snaps) (whoosh)

03:02:27.260 --> 03:02:28.680
They'll wake up pretty quick

03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:31.848
but we'll already be awake.

03:02:31.848 --> 03:02:36.848
MARISHA: (whispering) Do we go back to our house?

03:02:37.623 --> 03:02:38.990
LAURA: No.
LIAM: What are you saying?

03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:40.250
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. (chuckles)

03:02:40.250 --> 03:02:43.150
SAM: Where are we trying to get to ultimately?

03:02:43.150 --> 03:02:43.983
LAURA: Right?

03:02:45.055 --> 03:02:46.243
I think we should try to get to Essek.

03:02:46.243 --> 03:02:49.390
SAM: Well, call him at first. Why don't we call him first?

03:02:49.390 --> 03:02:51.060
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:51.893
MARISHA: Yes.

03:02:51.893 --> 03:02:53.810
LAURA: All right, I'm going to send a message to Essek.

03:02:53.810 --> 03:02:55.455
LIAM: Not at the destination?

03:02:57.200 --> 03:02:59.510
LAURA: I don't know what I'm saying anymore.

03:02:59.510 --> 03:03:01.470
SAM: Whatcha up to, can you help us?

03:03:01.470 --> 03:03:03.953
LAURA: We'll be at Aeor in a day and a half.

03:03:08.190 --> 03:03:10.290
TALIESIN: Can you help?
LAURA: Things are dire.

03:03:10.290 --> 03:03:11.924
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: They have lodestones.

03:03:11.924 --> 03:03:14.480
LAURA: They have lodestones.

03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:18.082
They want to bring back the Somnovem.

03:03:22.228 --> 03:03:24.860
TRAVIS: There's a hyphen in that bit, right?

03:03:24.860 --> 03:03:27.443
LAURA: Will you meet us? Will you help us?

03:03:33.070 --> 03:03:34.993
MATT: Rather rapid response comes in.

03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:38.688
"Jester, um...

03:03:39.938 --> 03:03:44.340
"your words in some ways are alien,

03:03:44.340 --> 03:03:46.783
"but I sense your worry.

03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:51.391
"I'm at the outpost,

03:03:51.391 --> 03:03:53.541
"southeast of the ruin.

03:03:55.316 --> 03:03:56.149
"Come."

03:04:00.772 --> 03:04:02.808
TRAVIS: He ain't comin'. He ain't comin'.

03:04:02.808 --> 03:04:04.729
LAURA: We go to him.

03:04:04.729 --> 03:04:06.179
SAM: Then what?
MARISHA: But then that--

03:04:06.179 --> 03:04:08.070
MARISHA: But if we go to him, I'm here for that--

03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:11.210
LAURA: We have him on our side and try to help.

03:04:11.210 --> 03:04:13.820
MARISHA: We're going to have-- the plan

03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:17.740
to have the entrance demolished wasn't bad

03:04:17.740 --> 03:04:19.220
because that could have forced us

03:04:19.220 --> 03:04:21.140
to have to redirect to him.

03:04:21.140 --> 03:04:24.610
We would have to convince the Tomb Takers.

03:04:24.610 --> 03:04:27.130
LAURA: Yeah, but the plan didn't work.

03:04:27.130 --> 03:04:29.320
MARISHA: I know, so what's another plan to convince them

03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:31.013
to go to the southeast side?

03:04:32.310 --> 03:04:34.548
LAURA: We go away and they chase us.

03:04:34.548 --> 03:04:37.890
SAM: (chuckles) Because we have a thing that they need.

03:04:37.890 --> 03:04:39.500
LIAM: True.

03:04:39.500 --> 03:04:40.508
TRAVIS: Ish.

03:04:45.410 --> 03:04:46.243
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:50.401
SAM: We don't even know if they're
going in from the north whatever.

03:04:50.401 --> 03:04:53.700
We think they are. They could be lying to us.

03:04:53.700 --> 03:04:54.816
TRAVIS: Very true.

03:04:56.796 --> 03:04:57.629
MARISHA: Fuck.

03:04:59.110 --> 03:05:01.010
If we go in the middle of the night,

03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:05.991
the rest of us would be exhausted.

03:05:05.991 --> 03:05:10.280
LAURA: We go now, we leave now, we just go.

03:05:10.280 --> 03:05:13.640
LIAM: If we go, we wait a couple hours until they're out.

03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:14.970
TALIESIN: I'm starting a Commune spell

03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:16.911
as this conversation's happening.
MATT: Okay.

03:05:16.911 --> 03:05:19.726
LAURA: What difference does it make?
Lucien never sleeps anyway.

03:05:22.470 --> 03:05:23.800
LIAM: That's true.

03:05:23.800 --> 03:05:24.916
TALIESIN: Take a minute to--

03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:28.899
MARISHA: How many more messages can you cast?

03:05:28.899 --> 03:05:32.410
LAURA: I mean, I can send a couple more,

03:05:32.410 --> 03:05:34.063
but that's using up spell slots.

03:05:35.140 --> 03:05:36.650
Who knows if we tried to do anything,

03:05:36.650 --> 03:05:39.210
they're going to chase us, we might have to fight.

03:05:43.350 --> 03:05:45.780
TALIESIN: So where did he say the entrance was again?

03:05:45.780 --> 03:05:47.036
TRAVIS: Northwestern.

03:05:48.960 --> 03:05:51.625
TALIESIN: All right, I'm good whenever.

03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:55.270
MARISHA: We lost a day of travel today.

03:05:57.310 --> 03:06:00.410
We could try and rest and enact this plan tomorrow.

03:06:01.630 --> 03:06:03.230
TALIESIN: Day after.

03:06:03.230 --> 03:06:04.080
MARISHA: Tomorrow night.

03:06:05.440 --> 03:06:06.790
TALIESIN: We're going to be exhausted.

03:06:09.490 --> 03:06:12.800
LAURA: So will they, and you guys won't.

03:06:14.370 --> 03:06:16.078
SAM: I feel great.

03:06:17.345 --> 03:06:20.020
That tea had something in it, a kick.

03:06:21.650 --> 03:06:23.280
LIAM: So we are going to just chance

03:06:23.280 --> 03:06:27.191
that we can find this entrance, yeah?

03:06:27.191 --> 03:06:29.810
LAURA: No. Well.
TRAVIS: Big gamble.

03:06:29.810 --> 03:06:32.610
That's a big gamble for a tiny payout.

03:06:32.610 --> 03:06:34.500
TALIESIN: I'll probably be hitting my trance pretty soon.

03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:37.923
LAURA: I thought we were going to
be trying to find Essek's outpost.

03:06:38.960 --> 03:06:40.320
SAM: For what, though?

03:06:40.320 --> 03:06:41.620
LAURA: To get Essek.

03:06:41.620 --> 03:06:43.450
SAM: But he said he's not leaving.

03:06:43.450 --> 03:06:45.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, the difference between the northwest corner

03:06:45.490 --> 03:06:49.040
and the eastern outpost could be like six to eight hours.

03:06:49.040 --> 03:06:50.390
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It's pretty big.

03:06:50.390 --> 03:06:53.230
LIAM: And maybe there is some benefit to having him join us

03:06:53.230 --> 03:06:55.350
because he's so talented,

03:06:55.350 --> 03:06:59.263
but what is to be gained by diverting away?

03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:03.920
Because we don't know if he's going to come.

03:07:03.920 --> 03:07:05.620
TRAVIS: I don't think--
LIAM: We don't know.

03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:09.797
TRAVIS: I mean, we're either riding in

03:07:10.680 --> 03:07:12.488
and playing it as we see it,

03:07:13.547 --> 03:07:16.270
or we're kicking it off in here.

03:07:16.270 --> 03:07:19.620
I look up at that, for the last look.

03:07:19.620 --> 03:07:21.090
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:07:21.090 --> 03:07:22.333
SAM: I think we ride in.

03:07:23.298 --> 03:07:27.150
TRAVIS: 17. (wheezes) 14, 15, 16, 17.
MATT: Right? Hell yeah.

03:07:27.150 --> 03:07:28.500
TRAVIS: It's climbing up by ones.

03:07:28.500 --> 03:07:29.750
MATT: At the moment, nothing.

03:07:30.670 --> 03:07:32.750
SAM: <i>At the moment</i>, Travis.

03:07:32.750 --> 03:07:35.290
TRAVIS: Be advised, at the moment.

03:07:35.290 --> 03:07:36.360
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going.

03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:37.700
MATT: As they're having this conversation

03:07:37.700 --> 03:07:40.000
their words begin to slowly fade, Caduceus,

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:41.670
as you begin to head into your trance

03:07:41.670 --> 03:07:44.400
and the warmth of the Wild Mother's presence surrounds you.

03:07:44.400 --> 03:07:45.990
You can hear the breeze,

03:07:45.990 --> 03:07:49.350
you can hear the splash of water on brooks around you.

03:07:49.350 --> 03:07:50.740
You feel yourself in the center

03:07:50.740 --> 03:07:53.460
of an interpretation of the jungle

03:07:53.460 --> 03:07:55.390
where you reconvened with your family.

03:07:55.390 --> 03:07:56.783
It's welcoming, it's warm.

03:07:58.460 --> 03:07:59.683
What would you like to ask?

03:08:02.160 --> 03:08:06.700
TALIESIN: Lucien Nonagon, is this second entrance

03:08:06.700 --> 03:08:08.530
that he's been talking about actually

03:08:08.530 --> 03:08:11.780
where he said it was, to the northwest?

03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:17.650
MATT: You get a stronger warm
breeze that blows past your back

03:08:17.650 --> 03:08:20.950
over your shoulder in the direction that you're facing,

03:08:20.950 --> 03:08:23.823
interpreting it as affirmation.

03:08:27.760 --> 03:08:30.888
TALIESIN: Does he need all of us
alive for what he plans to do?

03:08:31.810 --> 03:08:35.583
MATT: The breeze becomes extremely icily cold.

03:08:38.510 --> 03:08:41.490
MARISHA: "All of us." "All of us."

03:08:41.490 --> 03:08:43.373
TRAVIS: (whispering) Angel blood.

03:08:44.810 --> 03:08:46.885
TALIESIN: Changes my thought, then, uh--

03:08:48.940 --> 03:08:50.540
LIAM: We've seen angel blood before.

03:08:52.130 --> 03:08:54.872
TALIESIN: Does he need all of us alive when we arrive?

03:08:56.260 --> 03:08:59.350
MATT: The cold breeze continues blowing.

03:09:01.016 --> 03:09:02.132
TALIESIN: Hm.

03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:06.280
Interesting, all right.

03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:08.150
TRAVIS: What was the last one again? I'm sorry.

03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:10.620
SAM: Does he need us alive when we arrive?

03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:12.783
TALIESIN: Does he need us alive when we get there?

03:09:13.953 --> 03:09:15.263
And the answer is no.

03:09:16.340 --> 03:09:18.170
MARISHA: But you got a confirmation on northwest side?

03:09:18.170 --> 03:09:20.238
TALIESIN: That is-- he was not lying.

03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:24.250
MARISHA: Do you have five questions,
or is that Speak With Dead?

03:09:24.250 --> 03:09:25.790
TALIESIN: Three, five is Speak With Dead.

03:09:25.790 --> 03:09:27.708
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: "Need" and "want" are two different things.

03:09:27.708 --> 03:09:29.649
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

03:09:31.268 --> 03:09:32.734
TALIESIN: Maybe, maybe.

03:09:35.895 --> 03:09:37.380
MATT: Three questions with Commune.

03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:38.953
ASHLEY: He does <i>not</i> need us?

03:09:39.940 --> 03:09:41.110
TALIESIN: Nope.
MARISHA: He doesn't need all of us

03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:43.663
and he doesn't need all of us alive.

03:09:43.663 --> 03:09:45.962
SAM: But he might need some of us.
ASHLEY: But does he need some of us?

03:09:45.962 --> 03:09:47.379
SAM: Might need you.

03:09:48.455 --> 03:09:50.255
LAURA: He might need you.

03:09:51.597 --> 03:09:53.720
LAURA: How did he know you had angel blood?

03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:55.520
ASHLEY: Probably from the vials.

03:09:55.520 --> 03:09:56.353
LAURA: Oh, right.

03:09:56.353 --> 03:09:59.103
ASHLEY: You know, I don't think it's...

03:10:01.230 --> 03:10:02.400
TRAVIS: So again, what's to be gained

03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:05.310
if we were to collapse this
entrance that he's hoping to take?

03:10:05.310 --> 03:10:07.563
That it would force him to another one where--

03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:09.782
MARISHA: I feel like that would only be useful

03:10:09.782 --> 03:10:12.560
if we needed to buy time to get Essek on our side.

03:10:12.560 --> 03:10:14.373
TRAVIS: Which I don't think we're going to get.

03:10:16.246 --> 03:10:18.467
TALIESIN: I think it's a good call to talk to him.

03:10:18.467 --> 03:10:21.640
TRAVIS: Unless we want to kick off a fight beforehand,

03:10:21.640 --> 03:10:25.093
which I don't think any of us is feeling too strongly about.

03:10:27.156 --> 03:10:29.812
I think we're along for the ride, right?

03:10:29.812 --> 03:10:31.120
TALIESIN: For a little while.
SAM: Yeah.

03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:32.290
TRAVIS: I love home field advantage,

03:10:32.290 --> 03:10:33.610
that's the only reason I'm pushing it,

03:10:33.610 --> 03:10:36.340
but I really want to see where this goes, too.

03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:37.820
And we have that here.

03:10:37.820 --> 03:10:40.990
LIAM: Well, for those of us interested in trying to redeem

03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:44.310
our old friend, we certainly don't have a method

03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:47.123
to do so at the moment.

03:10:49.220 --> 03:10:51.360
The thin hope would be that--

03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:53.360
something about where we're going.

03:10:55.343 --> 03:10:56.647
Seems pretty thin.

03:10:56.647 --> 03:10:57.488
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

03:10:57.488 --> 03:10:59.250
SAM: Everything's thin, I think we just need

03:10:59.250 --> 03:11:00.490
to commit at this point.

03:11:00.490 --> 03:11:02.620
We've been talking around this for two days now.

03:11:02.620 --> 03:11:03.680
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: At least.

03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:05.640
SAM: Let's just go.
TRAVIS: We're in it.

03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:06.660
MARISHA: Go right now or go with them?

03:11:06.660 --> 03:11:08.570
SAM: No, go with them, get a night's sleep.

03:11:08.570 --> 03:11:10.260
MATT: Out of the corner of your eye,

03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:14.255
you see apparate once more that same orb.

03:11:14.255 --> 03:11:16.640
TRAVIS: (coughs loudly and sniffles)

03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:17.637
MARISHA: Cats again?

03:11:17.637 --> 03:11:19.803
TRAVIS: Ah-hah. Aaaah.

03:11:19.803 --> 03:11:21.360
Ahghlhhgh.

03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:22.700
SAM: Oh, no.
TRAVIS: (hacks)

03:11:22.700 --> 03:11:26.562
LIAM: Several cats do now approach
you at my telepathic bidding.

03:11:26.562 --> 03:11:29.145
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no.

03:11:29.145 --> 03:11:31.250
(laughter)

03:11:31.250 --> 03:11:32.870
SAM: I'm going to go to bed.

03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:34.240
MARISHA: Well, before we go to bed,

03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:36.950
I wouldn't mind reaching out to Yudala Fon,

03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:40.485
if we're about to crash for the night.

03:11:40.485 --> 03:11:42.320
SAM: Okay well, we're being, you know.

03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:43.310
LAURA: Okay
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:11:43.310 --> 03:11:44.660
SAM: Okay, go for it.

03:11:46.053 --> 03:11:48.380
LAURA: Send a message.
LIAM: We're being so good.

03:11:48.380 --> 03:11:51.572
LAURA: Hope I get to go to sleep tonight.

03:11:51.572 --> 03:11:54.190
MARISHA: And I was just let them know that--

03:11:54.190 --> 03:11:56.760
TRAVIS: --come into our rooms.

03:11:56.760 --> 03:11:58.590
LIAM: They have locks on them.

03:11:58.590 --> 03:12:00.256
MARISHA: Let them know--
TRAVIS: Just physical locks?

03:12:00.256 --> 03:12:02.340
Or magical, 9th-level, wizard locks?

03:12:02.340 --> 03:12:04.020
LIAM: No, there's no 9th-level.

03:12:04.020 --> 03:12:05.378
ASHLEY: Just be alert.

03:12:06.330 --> 03:12:08.030
LIAM: I've never brought anyone in here that I didn't trust.

03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:10.040
SAM: Should we all sleep in the same room together?

03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:12.310
TRAVIS: Well, I'm wondering if we all might.

03:12:12.310 --> 03:12:13.323
LAURA: Yeah, that's--

03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:16.160
TRAVIS: Sleep in the same room?

03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:17.900
SAM: Yeah, let's do that.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:18.990
LAURA: With them?

03:12:18.990 --> 03:12:21.759
TRAVIS: No, just us, instead of in our individual rooms.

03:12:21.759 --> 03:12:22.748
SAM: Yeah, let's do that.

03:12:22.748 --> 03:12:25.530
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that for--
MARISHA: Slumber party.

03:12:25.530 --> 03:12:27.700
LAURA: Oh, yeah.
ASHLEY: Should we at least bring some--

03:12:27.700 --> 03:12:29.000
MARISHA: Mattresses by the fireplace?

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:30.180
ASHLEY: Yeah, blankies and--

03:12:30.180 --> 03:12:33.950
LIAM: Yeah, we could get those from the floor below.

03:12:33.950 --> 03:12:34.870
MARISHA: Okay.

03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:36.440
LIAM: We could sleep where we slept with the Yetis

03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:38.750
or we could sleep in Veth and my chambers

03:12:38.750 --> 03:12:41.260
with the laboratory in between--
TRAVIS: With the yetis.

03:12:41.260 --> 03:12:44.727
LIAM: --or an the entire floor.
TRAVIS: Fuck me, this game.

03:12:44.727 --> 03:12:45.560
SAM: Sure.

03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:47.326
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Oh, this is quite--

03:12:47.326 --> 03:12:49.340
(laughter)

03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:52.496
LIAM: Listen, this is my doll house. I designed it.

03:12:52.496 --> 03:12:55.262
I get to play with it.
(laughter)

03:12:57.060 --> 03:12:59.100
LAURA: Okay, so I'm sending a message to Yudala.

03:12:59.100 --> 03:13:03.930
MARISHA: Just let them know that-- very preoccupied.

03:13:03.930 --> 03:13:05.280
You don't have to get into that detail.

03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:09.990
Just tell them I won't be able to make it back

03:13:09.990 --> 03:13:13.963
to the Cobalt Soul anytime soon.

03:13:15.460 --> 03:13:19.470
So any pertinent information

03:13:21.260 --> 03:13:23.320
they could deliver would be nice.

03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:24.153
LAURA: Okay.

03:13:25.370 --> 03:13:26.203
Hey.

03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:32.500
We won't be able to make it back any time soon.

03:13:32.500 --> 03:13:36.566
So any pertinent information,

03:13:37.892 --> 03:13:39.808
please tell.

03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:43.373
Use words carefully,

03:13:45.900 --> 03:13:50.062
but we could use words.

03:13:50.062 --> 03:13:54.130
(laughter)

03:13:54.130 --> 03:13:55.516
MARISHA: Honestly, that all tracks.

03:13:55.516 --> 03:13:57.141
MATT: Yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:13:59.827 --> 03:14:04.193
TRAVIS: "But we could use words!"
MARISHA: Nothing about that didn't make sense.

03:14:06.984 --> 03:14:09.123
MATT: Yudala Fon responds:

03:14:09.123 --> 03:14:10.364
"Of course.

03:14:12.820 --> 03:14:14.712
"Not pertinent,

03:14:15.635 --> 03:14:19.660
"an operative by the ruins...

03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:25.088
"previously, has information

03:14:25.088 --> 03:14:28.048
"on what the Cognouza is."

03:14:28.048 --> 03:14:30.014
SAM: (disappointedly) Oh.

03:14:30.014 --> 03:14:31.897
We know that already, right?

03:14:33.352 --> 03:14:35.197
MATT: Multiple forms of research going at the same time.

03:14:35.197 --> 03:14:38.120
Everybody else overlaps information.

03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:39.330
That's it.
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:14:39.330 --> 03:14:40.421
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: All right, so that's good.

03:14:40.421 --> 03:14:43.080
We know that we know... it.

03:14:47.525 --> 03:14:48.358
SAM: Okay.

03:14:48.358 --> 03:14:50.675
MARISHA: To me that tells us,

03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:54.281
we might see friends.

03:14:55.160 --> 03:14:56.020
LAURA: Maybe.

03:14:56.020 --> 03:14:59.153
Or that could be---
TRAVIS: Do we want to find out?

03:14:59.153 --> 03:15:01.578
LAURA: That could be the gnome that we scared off.

03:15:03.396 --> 03:15:05.570
TRAVIS: Do we want to figure out who the operative is?

03:15:05.570 --> 03:15:07.772
SAM: Well, it doesn't mean that the operative's there now.
TRAVIS: Or share what we know?

03:15:07.772 --> 03:15:10.813
SAM: It means the operative had previously gone and--

03:15:10.813 --> 03:15:13.308
MARISHA: It says "an operative by the ruins."

03:15:13.308 --> 03:15:15.358
SAM: An operative by the ruins--

03:15:15.358 --> 03:15:17.090
MATT: Previously.
SAM: -- who had been by the ruins.

03:15:17.090 --> 03:15:17.923
MARISHA: Previously?

03:15:17.923 --> 03:15:19.778
Okay, okay.

03:15:19.778 --> 03:15:21.462
TRAVIS: Sorry. Doesn't mean where we're going.

03:15:21.462 --> 03:15:22.511
LAURA: No.

03:15:22.511 --> 03:15:23.970
MARISHA: Okay.

03:15:23.970 --> 03:15:27.970
LAURA: All right, let's make a fort. A pillow fort.

03:15:27.970 --> 03:15:28.803
MATT: All righty.

03:15:28.803 --> 03:15:30.436
SAM: We shall rest.

03:15:31.410 --> 03:15:33.253
MATT: So you guys are arranging in which room?

03:15:37.700 --> 03:15:39.950
LIAM: I think that we should use Yasha's room,

03:15:41.270 --> 03:15:44.353
because it is sparse.

03:15:47.370 --> 03:15:50.440
We'll be sleeping on the-- yeah.

03:15:50.440 --> 03:15:52.880
I'll bring some bed mats, but on the floor.

03:15:52.880 --> 03:15:54.310
ASHLEY: Anybody can sleep in the bed.

03:15:54.310 --> 03:15:57.250
I usually sleep in the chair

03:15:57.250 --> 03:15:58.795
that's in there anyway, so.

03:15:58.795 --> 03:16:00.611
TALIESIN: You should try the bed, could be exciting.

03:16:00.611 --> 03:16:01.620
Try once.

03:16:01.620 --> 03:16:05.912
ASHLEY: Yeah. We could also do the--

03:16:05.912 --> 03:16:08.033
like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?

03:16:08.033 --> 03:16:09.083
You know, where--

03:16:09.083 --> 03:16:11.008
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah!
ASHLEY: Feets in?

03:16:11.008 --> 03:16:12.483
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
ASHLEY: Grandparents.

03:16:12.483 --> 03:16:13.883
LIAM: Grandpa Joe.
LAURA: So cozy.

03:16:13.883 --> 03:16:16.313
ASHLEY: Yeah. Feets together.

03:16:17.730 --> 03:16:20.053
MATT: Grandpa Joe. What a terrible person.

03:16:22.762 --> 03:16:24.449
When you really break it down--

03:16:24.449 --> 03:16:26.532
(laughter)
- he's awful.

03:16:27.539 --> 03:16:28.991
Sorry, I have a whole rant on that.
TRAVIS: Don't worry, Charlie.

03:16:28.991 --> 03:16:31.045
Our happiness depends on you.

03:16:31.045 --> 03:16:32.380
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:16:32.380 --> 03:16:35.755
LIAM: But I make a run down to the large chamber

03:16:35.755 --> 03:16:36.804
beneath the salon

03:16:36.804 --> 03:16:39.770
with all of the sliding door closets.

03:16:39.770 --> 03:16:41.810
The room of requirement that just offers up

03:16:41.810 --> 03:16:44.805
what you need and get some bed rolls and blankets

03:16:44.805 --> 03:16:47.330
and pillows and take a couple of trips back and forth

03:16:47.330 --> 03:16:48.708
with Veth's help.

03:16:48.708 --> 03:16:50.074
SAM: (surprised grunt)
LIAM: Yep.

03:16:51.300 --> 03:16:53.083
Just so we have something to sleep on.

03:16:56.400 --> 03:16:58.440
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Okay.

03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:00.870
MATT: So you guys go ahead and set up in Yasha's room?

03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:02.287
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:17:03.790 --> 03:17:05.860
So you go ahead and eventually find yourself asleep

03:17:05.860 --> 03:17:07.910
unless you have any other business to do?

03:17:09.130 --> 03:17:10.030
LIAM: Are we all in for the night?

03:17:10.030 --> 03:17:12.880
Does anyone need to leave this room for anything?

03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:14.070
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:15.852
LAURA: Hold on, let me go pee.

03:17:15.852 --> 03:17:16.854
MARISHA: (chuckles)

03:17:16.854 --> 03:17:18.710
LIAM: Well, that's in here.

03:17:18.710 --> 03:17:19.840
LAURA: Oh, I thought that was out--

03:17:19.840 --> 03:17:21.550
I feel more comfortable peeing

03:17:21.550 --> 03:17:23.455
in my own room. Hold on.

03:17:23.455 --> 03:17:24.886
MATT and LIAM: (laugh)

03:17:24.886 --> 03:17:26.300
SAM: I think she's going number two.

03:17:26.300 --> 03:17:27.266
TRAVIS: Beau, go with her.

03:17:27.266 --> 03:17:29.033
LAURA: Okay and now I came back.

03:17:30.794 --> 03:17:33.320
MATT: While you're about,

03:17:33.320 --> 03:17:35.330
you do hear this echoing whistle

03:17:36.930 --> 03:17:39.720
and glance up, and you can just barely make out

03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:43.010
the shape on the upper areas of the available tower.

03:17:43.010 --> 03:17:44.840
You see Lucien on his own,

03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:47.090
just walking around and just looking.

03:17:49.217 --> 03:17:50.300
LAURA: Hey, Lucien!

03:17:51.340 --> 03:17:53.850
MATT: The whistling-- (whistles, stops)

03:17:53.850 --> 03:17:55.230
"Yes?"

03:17:55.230 --> 03:17:57.630
LAURA: If you really want a fun tour, let me know.

03:17:58.580 --> 03:17:59.913
I can play a fun trick.

03:18:01.042 --> 03:18:02.900
MATT: "Do tell."

03:18:02.900 --> 03:18:05.236
LAURA: Up. Fly up.

03:18:05.236 --> 03:18:06.415
MATT: Okay.

03:18:07.265 --> 03:18:09.530
LAURA: Do you want to go? Do you want to see?

03:18:09.530 --> 03:18:10.920
MATT: "See what?"

03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:12.286
LAURA: The fun stuff.

03:18:17.430 --> 03:18:18.293
MATT: "Sure."

03:18:24.360 --> 03:18:25.435
LAURA: "Do you trust me?"

03:18:29.660 --> 03:18:30.870
MATT: Are you being deceptive in any way?

03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:31.970
LAURA: Nope.

03:18:31.970 --> 03:18:33.020
MATT: He takes your hand.

03:18:33.870 --> 03:18:37.615
LAURA: I'm going to cast Polymorph on both of us.

03:18:37.615 --> 03:18:39.457
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: And turn us into cats.

03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:42.582
MARISHA: ♪ I can show you the world ♪

03:18:42.582 --> 03:18:43.830
MATT: Okay.

03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:46.200
LAURA: And I then run off and show him the little doors

03:18:46.200 --> 03:18:48.997
so we can run around the tower as cats.

03:18:48.997 --> 03:18:50.810
TRAVIS: Doesn't that let him into our room?

03:18:53.314 --> 03:18:57.910
(laughter)

03:18:57.910 --> 03:19:02.910
LIAM: No, there's a lock on the
inside of those doors into the rooms.

03:19:03.210 --> 03:19:04.726
I'm not Scanlan Shorthalt.

03:19:04.726 --> 03:19:08.125
(laughter)

03:19:08.125 --> 03:19:10.341
There's no sneaking into my guests' chambers.

03:19:10.341 --> 03:19:13.510
Everyone has complete privacy and they are in control.

03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:15.206
MATT: Oh, the beard makes it creepier!

03:19:15.206 --> 03:19:17.289
(laughter)

03:19:18.227 --> 03:19:20.713
SAM: He can see you when you're asleep.

03:19:20.713 --> 03:19:22.255
MATT: Oh my god.

03:19:22.255 --> 03:19:23.380
TALIESIN: Just [inaudible] eyes.

03:19:23.380 --> 03:19:25.523
MARISHA: No, creepy Santa, no.

03:19:26.818 --> 03:19:30.290
MATT: Lucien gives chase for a little bit

03:19:30.290 --> 03:19:32.350
and then seems to be preoccupied

03:19:32.350 --> 03:19:35.270
with his own wanderings in cat form for a little bit.

03:19:35.270 --> 03:19:36.360
LAURA: Okay.

03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:39.440
I run up behind him and tried to tell him

03:19:39.440 --> 03:19:40.981
that it only lasts for an hour,

03:19:40.981 --> 03:19:43.084
but all I'm doing is meowing.

03:19:43.084 --> 03:19:47.790
MATT: (meows)
LAURA: (meows)

03:19:47.790 --> 03:19:49.240
SAM: She's been gone for so long!

03:19:49.240 --> 03:19:50.890
We need to send out a party.

03:19:50.890 --> 03:19:53.440
MATT: Yeah, how long do you wander about?

03:19:53.440 --> 03:19:55.960
LAURA: I'll wander around with
him for 30 minutes and then--

03:19:55.960 --> 03:19:57.592
MATT: Jester's gone for 30 minutes, guys.

03:19:57.592 --> 03:19:59.650
SAM: (screams)

03:19:59.650 --> 03:20:01.580
MARISHA: Maybe she's just taking a shit.

03:20:01.580 --> 03:20:02.868
SAM: Yeah, that's true.
TALIESIN: She does take a while.

03:20:02.868 --> 03:20:05.920
SAM: A huge shit.
LAURA: I did say I needed privacy.

03:20:05.920 --> 03:20:08.982
SAM: Nothing but pastry and milk.

03:20:08.982 --> 03:20:10.898
(laughter)

03:20:10.898 --> 03:20:12.331
SAM: Her shits are gigantic.

03:20:12.331 --> 03:20:16.156
(laughter)

03:20:16.156 --> 03:20:18.903
LIAM: Just fills the chamber pot all in one go.

03:20:19.915 --> 03:20:24.672
MATT: Yeah, no, there was a reputation around the--

03:20:24.672 --> 03:20:26.755
(laughter)

03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:29.700
MATT: -- the Château.
LIAM: I think 20 minutes into that,

03:20:29.700 --> 03:20:34.700
I would have spoken to Frumpkin
and put out an APB amongst the cats.

03:20:34.811 --> 03:20:35.644
MATT: Indeed.

03:20:35.644 --> 03:20:36.800
SAM: All Pussy Bulletin?

03:20:36.800 --> 03:20:37.858
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: Yep.

03:20:37.858 --> 03:20:39.207
(laughter)

03:20:39.207 --> 03:20:42.170
LIAM: That's Scanlan's house.

03:20:42.170 --> 03:20:43.540
MATT: Okay, so--

03:20:43.540 --> 03:20:48.366
LAURA: I'm a blue cat and when I turned Lucien into a cat

03:20:48.366 --> 03:20:50.640
I polymorphed him into a little red cat

03:20:50.640 --> 03:20:53.111
with little purple and teal swirls.

03:20:53.111 --> 03:20:54.728
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Aww.

03:20:54.728 --> 03:20:59.728
MATT: Oddly enough, though not of your implementation,

03:20:59.950 --> 03:21:03.800
the cat has visibly nine eyes that are red that glow

03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:06.038
through the fur across the cat.

03:21:06.038 --> 03:21:09.230
LAURA: Wiggy! Okay, cool.

03:21:09.230 --> 03:21:10.100
LIAM: Neat.

03:21:10.100 --> 03:21:12.030
MATT: But as he's following you a bit

03:21:12.030 --> 03:21:13.760
and then following your lead to go

03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:17.300
through all these tunnels, it's interesting.

03:21:17.300 --> 03:21:22.260
There's a playfulness to it that

03:21:22.260 --> 03:21:27.260
belies some of the intense conversations that have happened.

03:21:27.390 --> 03:21:29.506
And then you can see him growing

03:21:29.506 --> 03:21:31.570
a little more curious to wander on his own

03:21:31.570 --> 03:21:33.583
as you follow up behind and right then

03:21:33.583 --> 03:21:37.034
Frumpkin arrives and approaches to go,

03:21:37.034 --> 03:21:38.975
(meowing)

03:21:38.975 --> 03:21:39.892
LAURA: (meows)

03:21:39.892 --> 03:21:40.725
SAM: (laughs)

03:21:40.725 --> 03:21:42.554
MATT: Looks over at Lucien.

03:21:42.554 --> 03:21:45.179
(growls)

03:21:46.515 --> 03:21:47.497
LAURA: (unconcerned meow)

03:21:47.497 --> 03:21:49.645
(laughter)

03:21:49.645 --> 03:21:50.478
MATT: (meows)

03:21:50.478 --> 03:21:53.271
And goes and is trying to lead you back.

03:21:57.170 --> 03:22:01.390
LAURA: I'll look at Lucien. I do a little shruggy shrug.

03:22:01.390 --> 03:22:03.526
(questioning meow)

03:22:03.526 --> 03:22:04.773
MATT: (indifferent meow)

03:22:04.773 --> 03:22:07.531
And he darts off into the tunnels on his own.

03:22:07.531 --> 03:22:08.770
LAURA: I'll follow Frumpkin.

03:22:08.770 --> 03:22:09.645
MATT: Okay.

03:22:10.742 --> 03:22:12.935
LIAM: Oh, that one internet cat that goes--

03:22:13.854 --> 03:22:16.229
(laughter)

03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:17.418
TRAVIS: Shaquille O'Neal.
SAM: Yep.

03:22:17.418 --> 03:22:18.251
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:22:20.358 --> 03:22:21.191
MATT: Okay.

03:22:22.620 --> 03:22:24.450
LAURA: I'll go with Frumpkin.

03:22:24.450 --> 03:22:26.290
MATT: So you follow Frumpkin back.

03:22:26.290 --> 03:22:28.496
When do you turn back into a cat?

03:22:29.554 --> 03:22:32.180
LAURA: Well, I don't know, because if I turn back into me,

03:22:32.180 --> 03:22:34.548
does that cancel it on--?

03:22:34.548 --> 03:22:35.381
MATT: You can cancel it--

03:22:35.381 --> 03:22:37.002
I'd say for the purposes of this,

03:22:37.002 --> 03:22:40.270
because you use the object to twin cast it.

03:22:40.270 --> 03:22:41.170
I'll let you cancel one

03:22:41.170 --> 03:22:42.400
if you don't wish to cancel the other.

03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:46.153
LAURA: Okay, I'll cancel myself when I get back in the room.

03:22:47.260 --> 03:22:50.360
MATT: Okay, Jester arrives unharmed.

03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:51.680
LAURA: Through one of the doors.

03:22:51.680 --> 03:22:54.423
I'll (pat pat) on the little tunnel door.

03:22:55.590 --> 03:22:57.630
TRAVIS: Wow, it was that bad,

03:22:57.630 --> 03:22:59.639
you had to come in through another door, huh?

03:22:59.639 --> 03:23:01.855
LAURA: (meows) (poofing)

03:23:01.855 --> 03:23:05.905
I was a cat. Lucien's a cat.

03:23:07.410 --> 03:23:08.640
LIAM: That's his secret?

03:23:08.640 --> 03:23:11.210
LAURA: No. No, I turned to Lucien into a cat.

03:23:11.210 --> 03:23:13.771
LIAM: Oh, yes, that's foolish of me, okay.

03:23:13.771 --> 03:23:14.604
TALIESIN: Explains everything.

03:23:15.810 --> 03:23:19.433
LIAM: Okay, so did you do your poo?

03:23:20.820 --> 03:23:22.550
LAURA: I didn't poo, but--

03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:23.808
LIAM: Still need to?
ASHLEY: Did you pee?

03:23:23.808 --> 03:23:25.174
LAURA: I actually didn't pee.

03:23:25.174 --> 03:23:27.680
SAM: (laughs) You forgot?
LAURA: I got distracted.

03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:30.170
LIAM: Not even as a cat? Because it's free rein

03:23:30.170 --> 03:23:31.350
when you're a cat here.

03:23:31.350 --> 03:23:34.180
LAURA: You need a litter box, you can't just pee anywhere.

03:23:34.180 --> 03:23:37.400
LIAM: You can see them every 20 yards inside the tunnels.

03:23:37.400 --> 03:23:40.058
LAURA: Just-- this place would smell so bad!

03:23:40.058 --> 03:23:41.841
Is it magic fey pee?

03:23:41.841 --> 03:23:43.110
LIAM: Uh-huh.

03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:44.523
LAURA: I'm just going to use your bathroom

03:23:44.523 --> 03:23:47.240
and I'm going to go pee and I'll come back, okay?

03:23:47.240 --> 03:23:49.670
But he's still going to be a cat for another 15 minutes,

03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:52.370
if we want to do anything, he's a cat wandering around.

03:23:52.370 --> 03:23:54.570
Or, you know we could just let him be a cat.

03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:58.010
LIAM: Well, are we in here for the night?

03:23:58.010 --> 03:23:58.843
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:23:58.843 --> 03:24:02.058
LIAM: Okay, so to Frumpkin, who has returned as well,

03:24:02.058 --> 03:24:04.666
I say: I want you to--

03:24:04.666 --> 03:24:07.940
telepathically-- clog the arteries on five.

03:24:07.940 --> 03:24:10.020
Fjord, cover your eyes.

03:24:10.020 --> 03:24:12.710
And over the next three or four minutes,

03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:15.580
cat after cat, after cat, after cat, after cat, after cat

03:24:15.580 --> 03:24:18.310
vomits up like World War Z

03:24:18.310 --> 03:24:20.460
in from the bottom and out from the top.

03:24:20.460 --> 03:24:21.847
Not into the room we're in.

03:24:21.847 --> 03:24:24.180
(laughter)
LIAM: Not the room we're in!

03:24:24.180 --> 03:24:27.590
The central chamber just starts to fill

03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:32.590
with spectral cats, like popcorn in popcorn popper and fills

03:24:33.140 --> 03:24:38.140
like a glut in that center hallway.

03:24:38.290 --> 03:24:41.770
And I say: This is wild. You want to see something funny?

03:24:41.770 --> 03:24:44.962
And I open the little doorway
and there's, like, four cats like--

03:24:46.645 --> 03:24:47.500
pressed in there.

03:24:47.500 --> 03:24:48.333
SAM: Perfect.

03:24:48.333 --> 03:24:51.270
LIAM: And I have just clogged all of five

03:24:51.270 --> 03:24:55.590
and the tops of four and three leading into five.

03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:56.865
MATT: Okay.

03:24:56.865 --> 03:24:59.914
TALIESIN: I've had this dream.

03:24:59.914 --> 03:25:01.114
LAURA: Everything's okay now.

03:25:03.007 --> 03:25:04.215
TRAVIS: It was a nightmare.

03:25:05.210 --> 03:25:06.390
MATT: The spell connection you have

03:25:06.390 --> 03:25:08.839
with Lucien's Polymorph ends prematurely on its own.

03:25:08.839 --> 03:25:10.945
LAURA: Oh, he's not a cat anymore.

03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:15.368
MARISHA: Because he can cancel that shit at any moment.

03:25:15.368 --> 03:25:16.201
LAURA: Well, yeah.

03:25:16.201 --> 03:25:18.440
LIAM: He's pretty cool; he can do just about anything,

03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:19.273
it seems like.

03:25:19.273 --> 03:25:20.106
MARISHA: I know.

03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:22.823
LIAM: All right, well.

03:25:22.823 --> 03:25:23.656
TRAVIS: Going to bed.
SAM: Long rest.

03:25:23.656 --> 03:25:26.050
LIAM: You and I need to rest because--

03:25:26.050 --> 03:25:27.515
SAM: We need to actually rest.

03:25:27.515 --> 03:25:28.348
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:25:28.348 --> 03:25:30.590
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: I'll take first watch.

03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:31.432
MATT: All right.

03:25:31.432 --> 03:25:35.158
ASHLEY: I'm going to sit up against the door and just sleep.

03:25:35.158 --> 03:25:36.178
MATT: Okay.

03:25:36.178 --> 03:25:37.320
MARISHA: I take the bed.

03:25:39.320 --> 03:25:41.870
LIAM: Oh man, I'm going to get
straight eight hours of sleep?

03:25:41.870 --> 03:25:43.270
This is a fantasy.

03:25:43.270 --> 03:25:44.708
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:25:44.708 --> 03:25:45.541
LIAM: Wow.

03:25:47.220 --> 03:25:50.870
ASHLEY: Are you guys doing the sleepies

03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:52.950
with the feets, four people?

03:25:52.950 --> 03:25:53.836
LIAM: Touching tips?

03:25:53.836 --> 03:25:56.560
ASHLEY: The feets in the middle?

03:25:56.560 --> 03:25:57.434
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: In the bed?

03:25:57.434 --> 03:25:58.616
Four people on the bed?

03:25:58.616 --> 03:26:00.080
LAURA: We'll sleep in the bed.
MARISHA: There's room.

03:26:00.080 --> 03:26:01.130
MATT: So who's in the bed?

03:26:04.440 --> 03:26:05.580
TRAVIS: Who's in the bed?!

03:26:05.580 --> 03:26:07.166
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: All the ladies? Nah, jump in.

03:26:07.166 --> 03:26:08.558
SAM: I'll jump in.
TRAVIS: ♪ All the ladies ♪

03:26:08.558 --> 03:26:10.133
MATT: Okay, cool.

03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:13.950
So all but Fjord eventually find their way to sleep.

03:26:15.540 --> 03:26:18.703
Fjord, make a perception check.

03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:22.915
TRAVIS: Not as good. Nine.

03:26:25.010 --> 03:26:27.024
MATT: Nothing seems to catch your attention.

03:26:27.024 --> 03:26:29.166
LAURA: Hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:26:29.166 --> 03:26:31.000
MATT: Most of you asleep okay.

03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:33.460
In the beginning, it's that tension of knowing

03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:34.740
that the enemy is in the house

03:26:34.740 --> 03:26:39.262
that leads to an uncomfortable rest.
MARISHA: It's coming from inside the house!

03:26:39.262 --> 03:26:40.095
LIAM: (meows)

03:26:43.098 --> 03:26:43.931
TRAVIS: Fuck.

03:26:44.876 --> 03:26:49.851
[ominous music plays]

03:26:51.500 --> 03:26:54.480
MATT: Caleb and Beauregard.

03:26:54.480 --> 03:26:56.383
LAURA: Oh, because you looked.

03:26:58.860 --> 03:27:03.087
MATT: Through the challenging wrestling tonight and sleep--

03:27:03.087 --> 03:27:04.400
SAM: What?
TRAVIS: The book.

03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:08.330
MATT: As darkness awaits you in that place of dreams

03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:12.063
you find yourself in a cold dark space.

03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:20.620
You remember nodding off,

03:27:20.620 --> 03:27:23.803
but now you're here, conscious, it feels.

03:27:24.650 --> 03:27:27.360
And you look around in this darkness.

03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:28.649
MARISHA: Do we see each other?
LIAM: Yeah, are we aware?

03:27:28.649 --> 03:27:31.283
MATT: No, you're unaware of each other.

03:27:33.130 --> 03:27:34.263
MARISHA: Oh fuck.

03:27:36.111 --> 03:27:38.394
MATT: This faint red glow

03:27:39.644 --> 03:27:42.190
begins to warm in front of you,

03:27:42.190 --> 03:27:45.480
like a tiny tinder flash that begins to burn

03:27:45.480 --> 03:27:47.870
into a bright flame.

03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:52.870
Until there before you, you see a massive glowing red eye

03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:55.551
that just peers into you,

03:27:55.551 --> 03:27:58.351
inspecting you, piercing you,

03:27:58.351 --> 03:28:02.353
looking around, to you, within you.

03:28:04.350 --> 03:28:07.603
No words, no language.

03:28:12.540 --> 03:28:16.514
You immediately feel this sense of fear

03:28:16.514 --> 03:28:18.805
and odd desperation,

03:28:18.805 --> 03:28:22.613
but it begins to subtly pull away

03:28:23.460 --> 03:28:25.638
as you feel it connect to you.

03:28:25.638 --> 03:28:27.360
Like a single thought enters your mind,

03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:31.343
the light seems to swarm and fill your space.

03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:34.518
And all it says is--

03:28:35.801 --> 03:28:39.634
without language, but feeling, emotion.

03:28:42.055 --> 03:28:47.055
(echoing voices) "Welcome." "Welcome." "Welcome." "Welcome."

03:28:50.503 --> 03:28:52.320
And you hear this faint sound.

03:28:52.320 --> 03:28:54.986
This humming,

03:28:56.094 --> 03:28:59.800
like thousands of bees buzzing

03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:04.270
and as you listen, you begin to see scratches, shapes,

03:29:04.270 --> 03:29:07.630
flashes of the pages that you had looked at in that tome.

03:29:07.630 --> 03:29:10.410
And it's not buzzing; they're voices. They're screams.

03:29:10.410 --> 03:29:13.060
Hundreds, thousands of them, just faintly out of view.

03:29:15.143 --> 03:29:17.043
"Welcome."

03:29:17.043 --> 03:29:18.534
The eye closes,

03:29:22.078 --> 03:29:25.072
and you wake up, both shooting up at the exact same time

03:29:25.072 --> 03:29:27.345
within the chamber. (gasping)

03:29:28.640 --> 03:29:30.670
Catches your attention, Fjord, immediately.

03:29:33.330 --> 03:29:34.933
TRAVIS: That's rare.

03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:40.213
MARISHA: I grab my notebook.

03:29:43.270 --> 03:29:48.120
I start trying to copy as much as I could from memory.

03:29:48.120 --> 03:29:50.800
MATT: Okay, you start writing it down.

03:29:50.800 --> 03:29:52.055
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

03:29:52.055 --> 03:29:54.305
MARISHA: Shh!

03:30:02.520 --> 03:30:04.280
That's not good.

03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:11.480
MATT: You feel that fractal pull within the page,

03:30:11.480 --> 03:30:14.790
this vertigo still lingering

03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:16.230
after the dream that you both

03:30:16.230 --> 03:30:18.620
had independently experienced.

03:30:21.840 --> 03:30:24.050
As Beau's sketching in the book and holding it

03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.980
in front of her.

03:30:24.980 --> 03:30:26.530
Caleb, make a perception check.

03:30:27.459 --> 03:30:29.510
LIAM: I wanted to ask also: If I think back

03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:31.340
to what we looked at, which is hazy,

03:30:31.340 --> 03:30:33.710
but does it make any more sense?

03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:34.635
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:30:36.290 --> 03:30:37.306
LIAM: Perception, you said?

03:30:37.306 --> 03:30:38.139
MATT: Yes.

03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:40.689
LIAM: Open. Up!

03:30:42.650 --> 03:30:43.483
18.

03:30:43.483 --> 03:30:44.930
MATT: 18.

03:30:44.930 --> 03:30:46.990
As you're looking over towards
Beauregard and she's sketching,

03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:49.096
you see the back of the hand that's holding the book.

03:30:49.096 --> 03:30:51.790
ALL: (gasping)

03:30:51.790 --> 03:30:52.925
MATT: A single red eye.

03:30:52.925 --> 03:30:55.425
(gasping)

03:30:57.010 --> 03:30:58.730
MATT: She's just drawing.

03:30:58.730 --> 03:31:00.435
LIAM: And she's unaware?

03:31:00.435 --> 03:31:01.268
MATT: Seemingly.

03:31:04.630 --> 03:31:05.463
Nothing.

03:31:09.860 --> 03:31:11.290
LIAM: Stop.
MARISHA: What?

03:31:13.380 --> 03:31:16.740
LIAM: Take her hand and twist so that hers

03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:18.730
is on top of the back facing up.

03:31:18.730 --> 03:31:20.330
MATT: On the back of your left hand,

03:31:21.760 --> 03:31:25.509
you see an identical red eye

03:31:25.509 --> 03:31:28.097
on the skin to Lucien's.

03:31:28.097 --> 03:31:29.572
LAURA: (gasps) Search your body!

03:31:29.572 --> 03:31:31.530
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I know.

03:31:31.530 --> 03:31:34.130
Come here, come here, come here. Turn around.

03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:37.163
I look where the tattoo on her neck is.

03:31:38.060 --> 03:31:39.610
Are there any more?
MATT: No.

03:31:39.610 --> 03:31:41.210
MARISHA: I look at your neck.

03:31:42.635 --> 03:31:43.735
MATT: Nothing.

03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:47.260
MARISHA: Your arms, he had one on his arm?

03:31:48.720 --> 03:31:50.780
LIAM: Check the gooch.

03:31:50.780 --> 03:31:53.100
(laughter)

03:31:53.100 --> 03:31:54.658
MARISHA: Oh no!

03:31:54.658 --> 03:31:56.070
LIAM: That's the last place you look.

03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:58.296
LAURA: We wake up, Caleb butt-ass naked.

03:31:58.296 --> 03:31:59.300
(laughter)

03:31:59.300 --> 03:32:00.133
SAM: And Beau's like--

03:32:00.989 --> 03:32:02.890
MATT: Somnovem's like, "Oh, this was a bad idea."

03:32:02.890 --> 03:32:05.499
TRAVIS: I'm sitting there holding the Star Razor like--

03:32:05.499 --> 03:32:08.560
LIAM: Picks up Caduceus' staff and is like--

03:32:08.560 --> 03:32:13.130
I do actually-- Ichabod Crane pulls off his shirt

03:32:13.130 --> 03:32:16.392
and I start looking at bare chest and arms to see everywhere

03:32:16.392 --> 03:32:19.050
and turning around in front of Beauregard and Fjord.

03:32:19.050 --> 03:32:21.000
MATT: As Caleb's pulling back his robes,

03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:23.340
you can see on the right shoulder

03:32:23.340 --> 03:32:26.160
just above where the bicep and deltoid meet,

03:32:26.160 --> 03:32:28.910
you see a similar single red eye.

03:32:41.970 --> 03:32:44.168
LIAM: Ha ha ha ha.

03:32:45.180 --> 03:32:50.090
MATT: The rest of you begin to come to, hearing the shifting

03:32:50.090 --> 03:32:52.640
and ruckus and conversation and tension in the room

03:32:52.640 --> 03:32:56.720
is immediately accessible to you.

03:32:58.900 --> 03:33:00.650
TRAVIS: Wish I had that spell now.

03:33:01.620 --> 03:33:03.153
LIAM: Does it feel like anything?

03:33:04.620 --> 03:33:07.301
MATT: No, though strangely warm.

03:33:08.500 --> 03:33:12.473
MARISHA: I look down at my notes. What did I draw?

03:33:15.940 --> 03:33:20.940
MATT: You can see-- you recall writing your dream,

03:33:21.145 --> 03:33:22.337
the words of it,

03:33:22.337 --> 03:33:23.680
and you look down at the page again

03:33:23.680 --> 03:33:25.222
and it is just

03:33:25.222 --> 03:33:29.563
scratches and lines and nothing.

03:33:31.667 --> 03:33:34.858
TRAVIS: (chuckles) Hoo.

03:33:36.270 --> 03:33:37.457
SAM: Boy.
LAURA: What happened?

03:33:37.457 --> 03:33:38.769
MATT: And that's where we're going to pick up next episode.

03:33:38.769 --> 03:33:40.952
(groaning)
LAURA: No!

03:33:40.952 --> 03:33:42.817
(laughter)

03:33:42.817 --> 03:33:44.550
LAURA: Are you kidding?

03:33:44.550 --> 03:33:45.433
Holy--!

03:33:46.270 --> 03:33:48.153
MATT: You asked to read the book.

03:33:48.153 --> 03:33:49.161
MARISHA: You're right, you're right.

03:33:49.161 --> 03:33:51.100
Open up-- yeah.

03:33:51.100 --> 03:33:54.009
TRAVIS: Together, you did it together.
LIAM: I'm just glad it's not on my taint.

03:33:54.009 --> 03:33:55.146
(laughter)

03:33:55.146 --> 03:33:56.870
MARISHA: I don't know if it's good that we did it together

03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:58.886
or bad that we did it together.

03:33:58.886 --> 03:34:01.807
TRAVIS: I don't think it's good.

03:34:01.807 --> 03:34:03.423
Don't think it's good.

03:34:03.423 --> 03:34:04.943
MATT: That one itches.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:34:06.094 --> 03:34:07.544
Really hard to get to.
LAURA: (whispering) Welcome.

03:34:07.544 --> 03:34:08.760
MARISHA: Welcome.
TALIESIN: It sees.

03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:10.617
LIAM: Welcome to Berlin.

03:34:11.746 --> 03:34:13.329
SAM: You're level one now.

03:34:15.920 --> 03:34:17.136
MATT: Oh man.

03:34:17.136 --> 03:34:18.503
MARISHA: Level one, yeah.

03:34:18.503 --> 03:34:20.700
LAURA: Welcome to the Eyes of Nine.

03:34:20.700 --> 03:34:22.573
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:34:22.573 --> 03:34:25.960
TALIESIN: Wow.
LIAM: We'll be in all the nine groups.

03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:28.680
MARISHA: Just a starting fee of 199 gold

03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:30.153
for the first six months.
LIAM: You have to listen to

03:34:30.153 --> 03:34:31.710
a certain number of tapes.

03:34:31.710 --> 03:34:33.450
(laughter)

03:34:33.450 --> 03:34:35.768
MARISHA: By buying these amount of books.

03:34:35.768 --> 03:34:37.530
TRAVIS: And you have to recruit only ten people.

03:34:37.530 --> 03:34:38.713
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:34:40.360 --> 03:34:41.635
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:34:41.635 --> 03:34:43.720
MARISHA: Fuck!
SAM: Well, that complicates things!

03:34:43.720 --> 03:34:46.107
TRAVIS: Just a titty bit.

03:34:46.107 --> 03:34:47.498
TALIESIN: Wow.
LIAM: I love it.

03:34:47.498 --> 03:34:48.989
TALIESIN: I'm so happy.

03:34:48.989 --> 03:34:50.429
SAM: We have to kill Caleb and Beau now, too.

03:34:50.429 --> 03:34:51.262
LIAM: I love it.

03:34:51.262 --> 03:34:53.019
TALIESIN: Matt, this is more than I could've ever asked for.

03:34:53.019 --> 03:34:56.710
TRAVIS: You essentially turned the
wizard and the monk on us?

03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:58.470
Oh no.

03:34:58.470 --> 03:35:00.287
SAM: Or made them more powerful, maybe?

03:35:00.287 --> 03:35:01.240
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:02.560
LIAM: Then perish.

03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:04.849
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: (laughs)

03:35:04.849 --> 03:35:06.170
LAURA: Oh no.

03:35:06.170 --> 03:35:08.310
MARISHA: The one who's obsessed

03:35:08.310 --> 03:35:12.320
with gaining control of his domain.

03:35:12.320 --> 03:35:13.601
LIAM: Shut up, baby, I know it.

03:35:13.601 --> 03:35:16.184
(laughter)

03:35:17.118 --> 03:35:21.670
MARISHA: And the one who is skeptical,
fucking hates all of it.

03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:22.511
Fuck.

03:35:22.511 --> 03:35:23.828
TRAVIS: You did look at it together.

03:35:23.828 --> 03:35:25.260
MARISHA: We did, yeah.
TRAVIS: That was probably dumb.

03:35:25.260 --> 03:35:26.350
In that moment.

03:35:26.350 --> 03:35:27.560
Probably shouldn't think about it.

03:35:27.560 --> 03:35:28.880
We blessed and we guided

03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:31.070
and we didn't go like, "Maybe one of you goes first?"

03:35:31.070 --> 03:35:34.073
MARISHA: Well, we kind of knew, could have-- yeah.

03:35:34.073 --> 03:35:36.470
TALIESIN: Risk was always there.
TRAVIS: Yeah, we fucked up.

03:35:36.470 --> 03:35:37.760
TALIESIN: But wow.

03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:40.720
MATT: Hey man, you read the Elder Sign. (chuckles)

03:35:40.720 --> 03:35:43.230
MARISHA: Yeah, it's full Necronomicon.

03:35:43.230 --> 03:35:45.288
ASHLEY: I want to keep playing. I want to find out more.

03:35:45.288 --> 03:35:47.613
MATT: I know, I know. Well, soon enough.

03:35:47.613 --> 03:35:49.610
LIAM: Get one step ahead of him,

03:35:49.610 --> 03:35:50.840
learn something he didn't know,

03:35:50.840 --> 03:35:52.980
and instead we stared into the Necronomicon.

03:35:52.980 --> 03:35:54.227
MARISHA: We followed in his footsteps.

03:35:54.227 --> 03:35:55.060
LIAM: Yeah.

03:35:56.462 --> 03:35:57.645
MATT: Well.
LIAM: That's cool.

03:35:57.645 --> 03:36:01.407
MATT: We'll pick up from that revelation next time.

03:36:01.407 --> 03:36:03.354
SAM: Next week.
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: (groan)

03:36:03.354 --> 03:36:06.269
MATT: (chuckles) Super excited.

03:36:06.269 --> 03:36:07.490
Thank you all for joining us.

03:36:07.490 --> 03:36:09.160
Before I forget, because I wanted another clarification

03:36:09.160 --> 03:36:12.100
on this. There was confusion online

03:36:12.100 --> 03:36:13.280
and I wanted to confirm as well.

03:36:13.280 --> 03:36:15.320
I think I said it before, but the combat wheelchair

03:36:15.320 --> 03:36:17.240
that I had been using in the game is not designed by me;

03:36:17.240 --> 03:36:19.360
it is designed by Sarah Thompson

03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:22.114
@MustangsArt on Twitter.

03:36:22.114 --> 03:36:23.140
Do not give me the credit.

03:36:23.140 --> 03:36:24.883
It's all their work and they're amazing.

03:36:26.130 --> 03:36:28.940
Anyway, thank you all so much for joining us.

03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:32.243
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

03:36:32.243 --> 03:36:33.105
Good night.

03:36:33.105 --> 03:36:34.447
TRAVIS: What did you two do?!

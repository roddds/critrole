44
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.930
MATT: When you're a man

45
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.830
with a mouth as large as Sam's, anything's possible.

46
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.100
Okay.
LAURA: You won't be able to talk

47
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.395
until you take that stuff off.

48
00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:22.625
Okay.
TRAVIS: Okay, that's--

56
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.260
It's fun, they're awesome.

57
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.990
All right, Marisha, you've got some announcements.

58
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.860
MARISHA: Yeah.

59
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.020
MATT: Go clean yourself up, Sam.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.744
LAURA: Yeah, go, go.
MARISHA: Yeah.

61
00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:53.160
(laughter)

62
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.009
Speaking of content, Pub Draw is back.

63
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.730
(laughter)

64
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.503
Yeah, Pub Draw, woo!

65
00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:02.560
LIAM: Good stuff, good stuff.

66
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.200
MARISHA: You get to join Babs Tarr and I each week,

67
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.850
Wednesday afternoons at 5:00pm on our Twitch channel.

68
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.670
Our first guest yesterday was Mica Burton.

69
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.620
TRAVIS: So great.

70
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.320
MARISHA: And she was so great and awesome--

71
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.800
LIAM: I heard that it was Mica.

72
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.000
MARISHA: Yes, yeah--
TRAVIS: Formica.

73
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.480
MARISHA: And Way-com, as well.

74
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.355
Yes, instead of Wacom.

75
00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:26.572
Babs is a good host. (laughs)

76
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.840
No, she's an awesome teacher, come check it out

77
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.140
if you want to learn how to draw,

78
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.660
or brush up on your drawing skills

79
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.730
and draw along with us. Next week is going to be Laura,

80
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.100
back on the hot seat because she's so good.

81
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.900
So we had to drag her back.

82
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.220
And then the big daddy, this Friday,

83
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.450

84
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.450
and a few of us here from Critical Role and a few guests,

85
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.260
UnDeadwood is airing Friday,

86
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.050
October 18th at 7:00pm, and then

87
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.050
of course the VOD will be immediately up for Twitch.

88
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.921
LAURA: Are you going to take the rest off? Okay.

89
00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:06.504
(laughter)

90
00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:13.840
MARISHA: And it'll be on YouTube, yeah, it'll be on YouTube.

91
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.280
TRAVIS: I'm so ready.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

92
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.620
Seriously, though, you should check out UnDeadwood, it's--

93
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.643
TRAVIS: It's going to be pretty fucking sweet.

94
00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:22.470
MARISHA: It's going to be awesome.
LIAM: Freaky and solemn.

95
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.700
MARISHA: And please validate the blood, sweat,

96
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.575
and tears that has gone into that,

97
00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:27.516
please watch.
MATT: They've been busting their

98
00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.380
ass on this.

99
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.260
LIAM: Many people have been busting ass, yeah.

100
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.270
LIAM: So come check it out.

101
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.480
MARISHA: The production crew has really outdone themselves

102
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.330
on that one, so check it out.

103
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.879
MATT: Awesome.
MARISHA: Well, that's it for me.

104
00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.530
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: Back to you now.

105
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.200
MATT: I came to my station today
and found two adorable photos

106
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.150
of our own Taliesin Jaffe.
TALIESIN: What?!

107
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.460
MATT: And Ashley Johnson.
TALIESIN: What?!

108
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.640
MATT: I don't know why they were here,

109
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.410
but I felt it was important for me to share.

110
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.359
TALIESIN: Aww.
TRAVIS: Ashley and Jean-Claude Van Damme!

111
00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:53.410
MATT: You thought they only grew into it.

112
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.690
No, they were always this cute, anyway,

113
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.620
that's enough of that, thank you,

114
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.960
whoever put that at my station today.

115
00:05:00.847 --> 00:05:03.670

Finally, we managed to make that happen.

(laughter)
MATT: (inaudible in same accent as Laura)

131
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.480
LAURA: We've got this, speaking of Pub Draw,

132
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.840
look at this! It's a Pub Draw pencil case,

133
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.820
slash brush case, slash dice holder,

134
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.130
slash makeup case, which I heard you guys say,

135
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.250
which was brilliant, designed by our very own Aaron Monroy,

136
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.550
which it's just the most beautiful thing ever.

137
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.910
Follow your art heart.

138
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.330
And then we've also got.
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

139
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.903
LAURA: A set of cards for UnDeadwood,

140
00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:07.460
and I kind of don't want to pull them out

141
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.270
and show them off because the art is so beautiful

142
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.560
that I want it to be a surprise.

143
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.910
MARISHA: Yeah, and it'll look, it'll look good.

144
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.380
We want to do it justice.

145
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.213

152

MATT: The last time, hey, guys, welcome back.

185
00:08:26.163 --> 00:08:28.163
MARISHA: I love him now.

186
00:08:28.163 --> 00:08:29.976
MATT: You guys killed him! Sorry, they just found out

187
00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.486
that it was called a froghemoth from last week.

188
00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:33.472
LIAM: Froghemoth.

189
00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:38.472
MATT: So last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

190
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.633
discovering that there had been an absence

191
00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:45.656
of paths to success after a series of failures

192
00:08:45.656 --> 00:08:48.218
to try and stop Obann and his plan towards

193
00:08:48.218 --> 00:08:49.874
whatever nefarious scheme he has

194
00:08:49.874 --> 00:08:52.467
that involves the Angel of Irons.

195
00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:54.713
You returned to Nicodranas to begin to gather the allies

196
00:08:54.713 --> 00:08:56.931
you did have, discovering that Yussa,

197
00:08:56.931 --> 00:08:58.681
the archmage that resides there,

198
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.400
and you had had some previous dealings with,

199
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.773
has gone missing, seemingly finding himself traveling

200
00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:08.140
into the Heirloom Sphere that you had given to him.

201
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.973
LAURA: Happy Fun Ball.

202
00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:10.830
MATT: I almost went Happy Fun Ball,
but that's you guys' thing.

203
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.310
The Heirloom Sphere, AKA the Folding Halls of Halas.

204
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.240
LIAM: (laughs)

205
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.073
MATT: Happy Fun Ball.

206
00:09:18.073 --> 00:09:19.820
TRAVIS: I've forgotten both of those things.

207
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.498
MATT: Yeah, it's great.
(laughter)

208
00:09:23.498 --> 00:09:28.070
Who needs lore?
(laughter)

209
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.903
Anyway,

210
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.140
the servant, Wensforth, of Yussa,

211
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.860
requiring aid after three weeks

212
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.690
that his master's been missing without any sort

213
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.580
of confirmation, communication, or seeming signs

214
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.218
of his return, asked you guys for permission

215
00:09:43.218 --> 00:09:46.020
to call in an ally. Through his own anxiety,

216
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.450
you agreed to allow him to do so,

217
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.999
and he called in a

218
00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:53.540
female wizard in her,

219
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.960
it would be early, mid 50s

220
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.870
from a far-off land called Tal'Dorei,

221
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.282
known as Arcanist Allura Vysoren.

222
00:10:02.607 --> 00:10:03.686
LIAM: What a boss.

223
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.050
MATT: With your help, you began to put together the pieces

224
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.720
of what had happened and what was necessary,

225
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.810
which was, somebody had to delve into this sphere.

226
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.070
As it is also referred to by some as the Archmage Bane,

227
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.660
Allura is well aware of the dangers

228
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.660
of herself going in there, and decided

229
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.170
to let you guys take care of this venture,

230
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.250
and she would remain with a magical item

231
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.820
that allowed you to communicate a few times a day,

232
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.770
should you have any questions,

233
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.830
or needed some correspondence between the two of you.

234
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.040
Going back into the puzzle ball,

235
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.180
Caleb managed to unlock, straight away,

236
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.550
a means into this sphere's folding halls.

237
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.370
You began to make your way from room to room,

238
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.780
venturing to a location known as the Garden,

239
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.040
where you had encountered some sort

240
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.890
of terrifying froghemoth, which they now know,

241
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.680
and various frog-like humanoids

242
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.300
that seem to be gathered around it in its presence.

243
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.980
You managed to slaughter most of them,

244
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.130
defeat the creature after it swallowed two of you,

245
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.880
watched its body sink beneath the waters

246
00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.450
of the pond that it seemed to be awaiting in,

247
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.870
and begin to find out where you can pass next.

248
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.130
With a few different doorways or paths

249
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.800
at your disposal, you climbed up the edge

250
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.860
of the mountain that existed in the Garden,

251
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.210
and plunged into the cavern there,

252
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.720
as you realized, some sort of construct seemed

253
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.210
to be following you.

254
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.510
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's right, I forgot

255
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.610
about the construct.
TRAVIS: The big fuck off--

256
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.500
MARISHA: Go home, guy--

257
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.420
MATT: Welcome back.

258
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.140
LIAM: You can't even tell you were wearing anything.

259
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.228
LAURA: Ever, what, it looks like your skin is off

260
00:11:29.228 --> 00:11:30.443
of your head right here--

261
00:11:30.443 --> 00:11:32.070
TRAVIS: It looks like you got really drunk

262
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.130
on a transatlantic flight, and then puked

263
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.277
in that airplane toilet.
MARISHA and LIAM: Yeah.

264
00:11:37.277 --> 00:11:39.220
LAURA: What's happening with your,

265
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.610
did you have an allergic reaction to the spirit gum?

266
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.700
SAM: There was spirit gum, and I tried

267
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.320
to use the spirit gum remover, which is acid,

268
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.580
and that hurt a lot, so I stopped.

269
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.580
MATT: Don't use spirit gum, use Pros-Aide,

270
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.800
what's wrong with--
SAM: I don't know what that is.

271
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.240
MATT: I'm going to have a conversation with you after this.

272
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.950
SAM: But now there's, my half, my face has spirit gum on it.

273
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.910
MATT: Yay. (claps)

274
00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.920
MARISHA: Yeah. It looks like you're just coming

275
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.800
from Electric Daisy Carnival.

276
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.510
SAM: Thanks to Dani Carr, for the makeup help.

277
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.343
MATT: Yeah!

278
00:12:06.343 --> 00:12:08.898
SAM: And to no one for helping me get out of the makeup.

279
00:12:08.898 --> 00:12:10.200
(laughter)

280
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.010
MATT: You're welcome.
(laughter)

281
00:12:15.703 --> 00:12:16.960
LAURA: Didn't I say that last week,

282
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.440
when you were all taped up like you were?

283
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.380
I walked in the bathroom, and he had put the bandages

284
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.637
on himself, and he had taped his hand completely--

285
00:12:26.637 --> 00:12:28.630
SAM: This is embarrassing.
LAURA: Completely shut,

286
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.890
and his fingers were turning purple.

287
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.420
He had no way to get out of it,

288
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.020
because his other arm was in a bandage, too.

289
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.750
I had to go find scissors and cut him out

290
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.950
of it because he was going to lose his fucking fingers.

291
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:39.783
SAM: That checks out.

292
00:12:39.783 --> 00:12:42.553
LIAM: You've got glittery paste across your forehead.

293
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.740
TRAVIS: You look like you just came out of the birth canal.

294
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.870
(laughter)

295
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.180
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond.
(laughter)

296
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.846
MATT: So.
LAURA: So. (clears throat)

297
00:12:52.846 --> 00:12:55.296
MATT: After you had all ventured through this tunnel.

298
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.620
SAM: We're ready.
MATT: <i>Children?</i>

299
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.800
As you ventured through this tunnel

300
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.060
and found yourselves transitioning

301
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.890
into this next chamber within the many,

302
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:11.120
many folding halls, you emerged on some sort of a rock

303
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.800
and metallic lip, overlooking a rolling,

304
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.500
chaotic sky on all sides

305
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.580
of burning purple clouds

306
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.020
and storms flashing bits

307
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.160
of occasional purplish blue lightning in the distance,

308
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.860
as little chunks of rock began to slowly rotate

309
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.750
and float, some close, some far off.

310
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.470
Glancing up and down, you can see

311
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.350
that you were on the outside lip

312
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.980
of some extensive tower built of rock,

313
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.390
stone, metal, and gears in some ways and shapes.

314
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.770
You see it shifting in places,

315
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.520
you hear the metal grinding and pushing,

316
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.570
echoing throughout the atmosphere around you,

317
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.930
and the tower seems to curve away,

318
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.990
and then downward as well, like it's bending

319
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.750
before it fades into the mist of the distance.

320
00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.080
And that was where we left off.

321
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.160
So Mighty Nein, you all emerge here,

322
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.460
the wind beginning to whip your hair around.

323
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.510
Glancing out of this expanse before you,

324
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.980
about 10 to 15 feet before you were to tumble off the edge

325
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.680
into whatever oblivion awaits you.

326
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.760
What do you wish to do?

327
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.735
SAM: What's this place called, Caleb?

328
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.120
From the map, what does it say?

329
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.082
LAURA: It's called the Tower.
SAM: Okay.

330
00:14:24.082 --> 00:14:27.840
LIAM: Is there any passage on any other side

331
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.430
of the tower that we can see from here?

332
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.010
MATT: Make a perception check.

333
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.744
LAURA: Allura is watching from the mirror.

334
00:14:34.744 --> 00:14:37.520
Can you see all these things floating around?

335
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.760
Are there things floating around?

336
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.240
MATT: There are, there are various sized pieces of rock.

337
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.450
You see two collide and shatter,

338
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.880
and other pieces about 700, 800 feet off

339
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.400
to one side, some of them are moving at faster speeds,

340
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.640
some slower, some closer, some further.

341
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.230
LAURA: I'm thinking of the Omega 13.

342
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.750
MATT: Yeah, there you go.

343
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.183
TRAVIS: Why is this here?
MATT: 19, all right.

344
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.470
You do notice a faint green-blue halo

345
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.530
around a circular doorway, about 150 feet up the tower

346
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.910
from your current position.

347
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.290
You can see the edges spiral a bit,

348
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.850
like the lip that you're on seems

349
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.520
to curve up the side of the tower,

350
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.430
and about maybe two spirals upward,

351
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.970
you see a faint bit of a green-blue glow.

352
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.240
Because the curvature of the tower,

353
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.400
you can just barely see the top

354
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.910
of the doorway that it's emanating from.

355
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.780
LIAM: I'm sorry, the lip we're on continues walkably?

356
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.620
MATT: Yes, or from what you can see.

357
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.970
You only have a visual range of what's--

358
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.820
SAM: Is it steps, or just a slope?

359
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.880
MATT: It's a slope.

360
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.260
TRAVIS: Just because I'm a glutton for punishment,

361
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.900
can I walk to the edge and see what down looks like?

362
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.581
MATT: Yeah, so you walk to the edge and glance down.

363
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:42.456
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Yeah!

364
00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:43.890
MATT: And you can see the gradual curvature

365
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.230
of the tower. It's like staring down at something

366
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.330
that begins to bend, and your sense

367
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.620
of direction, upon looking over the lip,

368
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.194
begins to drift a bit, and vertigo begins

369
00:15:53.194 --> 00:15:54.400
to take you for a second.

370
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.550
You find yourself going

371
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.590
on your hands and knees, just to hold

372
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.880
onto something as up, down, left, right begins

373
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.410
to make less and less sense.

374
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.160
You pull back a bit after staring down

375
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.110
into that void, and it's just the tower,

376
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.740
and you can see that spiral lip, but

377
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.490
in some places, it's broken. In some places,

378
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.080
it's just gears in place of it.

379
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.500
The tower itself seems to bend and shift

380
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.255
in strange ways. It's not just a straight,

381
00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:18.690
solid tower. It doesn't seem to follow the general laws

382
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:19.970
of physics that you're used to seeing

383
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.920
on a material plane.
LAURA: I grab the back

384
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.320
of Fjord's armor, just so he doesn't fall forward.

385
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.810
TRAVIS: Thank you, it's rather disorienting.

386
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.663
Below is terrible, perhaps we should go up and forward?

387
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:33.940
SAM: Is that the only direction?

388
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.920
LAURA: Well, I think any direction, we could go,

389
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.660
but I don't know how safe it would be.

390
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.780
MARISHA: I'm going to glance--

391
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.770
MATT: It continues down, and you can go either way,

392
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.660
either curving upward, or to the right,

393
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.870
I mean, it's going further down.

394
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.870
MARISHA: Can I look down and see if I,

395
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.590
I'm going to creep to the edge, do that thing you do

396
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.633
on the edge of a cliff, and see if I can spot anything

397
00:16:53.633 --> 00:16:56.382
in the down direction.
MATT: Make a perception check.

398
00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.007
TRAVIS: Okay. Just did that.

399
00:16:58.007 --> 00:17:00.633
MARISHA: Oh, is it, well, I fucking failed anyway.

400
00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:02.945
(laughter)

401
00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:03.778
MATT: You would have made a perception check

402
00:17:03.778 --> 00:17:05.310
as well.
LAURA: I grab the back of Beau's shirt, too,

403
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.837
just so she doesn't fall forward either,

404
00:17:07.837 --> 00:17:09.380
because I'm already doing that for Fjord,

405
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.920
because he just did that.
TRAVIS: 20. 18 plus two.

406
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.840
MATT: 21?
TRAVIS: 20.

407
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.210
MATT: 20.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

408
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.960
MATT: Okay, you do notice,

409
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.943
about 200 or so feet downwards,

410
00:17:20.943 --> 00:17:23.570
there are a series of rocks that are rotating.

411
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.720
A lot of these you can see are orbiting

412
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.800
around the tower at wider and shorter orbits,

413
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.370
as well at different speeds.

414
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.680
There's one about 250 or so feet down

415
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.780
that has a structure on it, with a very faint,

416
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.770
I want to say, a faint purplish glow

417
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.850
that emanates from it.

418
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.190
LIAM: I don't know how reliable direction is

419
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.020
on this map, it's not traditional,

420
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.470
but there is maybe a down,

421
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.956
and maybe up, somewhat.

422
00:17:54.956 --> 00:17:55.890
LAURA: Okay.

423
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.990
SAM: Just so we're all clear, down isn't the worst thing

424
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.600
in the world.
LIAM: It says Arcane Armory.

425
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.800
SAM: There could be weapons for us to

426
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.541
pilfer and steal there,

427
00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:06.890
or borrow or whatever.

428
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.890
LIAM: Or to kill us, but it is certainly interesting.

429
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.550
LAURA: Allura's still on the mirror?

430
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.870
MATT: Allura is, yeah, she's looking out,

431
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.770
as you're facing it outward.

432
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.780
LAURA: Allura, do you think in the Arcane Armory,

433
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.290
there would be things for us to take?

434
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.180
Or do you think it would be like dangerous things

435
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.720
that we should stay clear of?

436
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.670
MATT: "Yes, I think, yes."

437
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.570
LAURA: Cool.
MARISHA: To which one?

438
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.240
Yes to both?
MATT: "Yes to both.

439
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.570
"I don't know, if this is an arcane armory

440
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.470
"for an archmage as powerful as Halas was,

441
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.050
"who build all of this, of course he'd have things

442
00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.120
"to protect himself, things he's gathered in time

443
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.410
"and things to defend the things

444
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.000
"that he's gathered, as well.

445
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.590
"Everything here is trapped to some degree,

446
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.587
"I'm certain of it, that's why I didn't go in.

447
00:18:43.587 --> 00:18:45.110
"You're already doing better than I would have,

448
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.670
"so congratulations."
LIAM: Yeah, well, we know he had

449
00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:50.750
a comparable library, so it stands

450
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.540
to reason that he has a vault.

451
00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.320
MARISHA: Which has probably been pillaged, as well.

452
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.570
TALIESIN: Possibly, or he marked that it was there,

453
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.778
and walked off.

454
00:19:00.778 --> 00:19:03.470
SAM: Well, yeah, Yussa doesn't have much,

455
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.280
much use for weapons and stuff, maybe--

456
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.200
TRAVIS: So the door above has a bluish hue,

457
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.840
this one has a purplish hue.

458
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.630
If there's a chromatic range, probably is further down.

459
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.552
TALIESIN: Ah, that's very clever.
LAURA: That's one way

460
00:19:17.552 --> 00:19:18.780
to think of it.

461
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.990
Oh, yeah, and maybe if we keep going up the tower,

462
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.800
we'll find a red door eventually.

463
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.820
TRAVIS: Just because shit is orbiting,

464
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.090
I gave a little jump, do I, is gravity the same?

465
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.170
MATT: It is. It's interesting, you jump,

466
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.550
and when you land, you land at a slight angle.

467
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.480
It's like the further away from the tower you go,

468
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.760
the gravity is more angled away from the tower.

469
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.640
On the lip, it holds you vertically, but leaping outward,

470
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.340
it seems to pull you back this way.

471
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.886
TRAVIS: Cool, very cool.
TALIESIN: This is a lot.

472
00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:52.950
LAURA: Which way, up or down, up or down?

473
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.650
I'm afraid that if we stay here too long,

474
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.090
one of those things is going to come after us.

475
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.923
TRAVIS: That's true.

476
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.550
SAM: Half of us go up, and half go down.

477
00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.300
TRAVIS: Inclinations, votes?
LAURA: I don't like it.

478
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.530
TRAVIS: Gut instincts?
LIAM: Down.

479
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.620
TRAVIS: Same.

480
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.790
MARISHA: Start down, we could always make our way back up.

481
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.400
TRAVIS: Hopefully. It's 200 feet down. Is there a path

482
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.650
from the same way down as there is up?

483
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.760
MATT: Yeah, if you turn to the right,

484
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.360
it continues to rotate downward.

485
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:21.843
SAM: Sure, yeah, yeah, odds are

486
00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:24.170
we're going to have to go to both, so.

487
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.670
TALIESIN: I'm a little out of my depth, I'm following.

488
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.360
This is a lot.
MARISHA: Down it is.

489
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.070
TRAVIS: Let's go.
LAURA: We're going down, Allura.

490
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.170
MATT: "Very well, good luck, please be careful.

491
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.400
"Gravity seems to be strange here, just as time is, so--"

492
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.140
LAURA: How are we talking right now?

493
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.720
Are things moving really slow around you, or--

494
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.470
MATT: "It's very difficult for me.

495
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.500
"You are talking extremely slow."

496
00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:49.590
LAURA: Weird. (very fast) So if I talk like this,

497
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.952
do I sound like I'm talking like a normal speed?

498
00:20:52.952 --> 00:20:54.920
MATT: "No, a very slow drunk person."

499
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.520
LAURA: Oh, well.

500
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.220
MATT: "But it's curious, at least, it seems

501
00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.400
"to be manifesting strangely on my side.

502
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.210
"That's very disturbing.

503
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.760
"Amusing, but disturbing, yes, it seems

504
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.190
"to be dilating the length of the enchantment

505
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.620
"on my side, as well. Don't do that, please."

506
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:20.100
LAURA: Okay, we'll.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

507
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.640
LAURA: Oh, that's pretty great.

508
00:21:24.739 --> 00:21:27.690
I guess we'll call you back when we find something else

509
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.074
that's interesting or dangerous or life threatening.

510
00:21:31.074 --> 00:21:32.140
MATT: (crashing)

511
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.070
TALIESIN: Remember that time--
LAURA: Oh, run!

512
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.710
Which way is it coming from?

513
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.860
MATT: You guys are just on the lip,

514
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.890
and the doorway behind you, you can see a stone hand,

515
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.195
and a clawed hand come out.

516
00:21:43.195 --> 00:21:45.360
LAURA: Oh, no, no, we're going to get trapped going down

517
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.852
and we will never get back up.

518
00:21:46.852 --> 00:21:48.344
LIAM: It's right down the side.

519
00:21:48.344 --> 00:21:50.330
MATT: It's about a 10 to 15-foot lip,

520
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.510
so it's not super precarious.
LIAM: Not doing that though.

521
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.920
LAURA: I think we should move quickly.

522
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.770
MARISHA: Move faster, Caleb.

523
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.240
LAURA: Move fast, so that he doesn't see

524
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.650
which direction we went, go, go, go, go.

525
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:00.658
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: I just grab

526
00:22:00.658 --> 00:22:02.320
Caleb's arm and drag him

527
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.140
with me as I run.
MATT: Okay.

528
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.980
You guys continue rushing downward,

529
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.570
hearing the sounds of this thing emerge

530
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.180
from the doorway behind you.
LAURA: Oh, god.

531
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.570
MATT: Heading downward, you glance off the side a bit,

532
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.090
and you can see more of these floating islands

533
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.690
and bits of rock. They're not heavily clustered,

534
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.810
but there's a handful of them that are visible,

535
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.180
and occasionally shifting out of view,

536
00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.660
past the opposite side of the tower.

537
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.120
LAURA: Do any look jump able from the lip?

538
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.950
MATT: Where you are right now?
LAURA: Just in case.

539
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.761
MATT: Make a perception check.

540
00:22:31.761 --> 00:22:35.597
TRAVIS: That inflection says, "Death is--"

541
00:22:35.597 --> 00:22:36.470
LAURA: Nine.

542
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.630
MATT: Nine. At the moment, you don't see anything

543
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.875
of that kind. You guys go rushing down,

544
00:22:40.875 --> 00:22:44.023
jumping, or running along the sides.

545
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.500
There's a flash of purple light not far off,

546
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.290
a bold of lightning streaks across the sky

547
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.580
from one of these wispy clouds to another.

548
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.100
You shield your eyes for a moment,

549
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.250
and continue downward, as the rumbles continue

550
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.110
to tear through the vicinity.

551
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.670
You come around the edge, and it looks like a giant set

552
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.670
of gears now block the path where you're at.

553
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.650
One's moving faster than the other,

554
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.920
and every time it snaps into place,

555
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.970
you hear a metal. (metal creaking)

556
00:23:14.398 --> 00:23:15.231
SAM: Oh god.

557
00:23:15.231 --> 00:23:16.570
LAURA: Is it the way, we have to jump from one gear,

558
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.560
like try to time it to where we don't get smooshed,

559
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.401
and jump over--
MATT: That's up to

560
00:23:19.401 --> 00:23:20.659
you guys.
MARISHA: Platformer style?

561
00:23:20.659 --> 00:23:21.992
MATT: What are you guys going to do?

562
00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:23.380
It blocks your path.

563
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.160
MARISHA: Is there gaps when it rotates?

564
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.690
TRAVIS: Can you see through the space?

565
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.980
MATT: No, one of the gears is about four and a half,

566
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.760
five feet high, and a heavier one

567
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.200
that's not actually intersecting with that one,

568
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.857
but is overlapped, or it is overlapping one behind it

569
00:23:36.857 --> 00:23:39.460
that is a wide, 20-foot radius gear

570
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.190
that is half emerging out the side of the tower.

571
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.820
LIAM: So completely blocking the passage.

572
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.700
MATT: Completely blocking the passage.

573
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.460
LAURA: So we could grab onto one and potentially ride it up?

574
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.190
MATT: Potentially.
MARISHA: I'll try it.

575
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.720
LAURA: Does it look like there's one

576
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.220
that it would be less life threatening to do that with?

577
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.630
Like--
SAM: The one on top.

578
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.740
MATT: From current point of visibility?

579
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.400
There's the four and a half foot one

580
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.070
that only a quarter of it is emerging,

581
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.110
it's right there, and then the one behind it is much larger,

582
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.320
and goes much higher into the tower.

583
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.660
LAURA: It is going up?
MATT: Yeah.

584
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.930
LAURA: Then we should jump onto the one going up.

585
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.000
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: And then just try to--

586
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.360
SAM: Ride it all the way around?

587
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.220
LAURA: Well, where we don't get squished,

588
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.580
but yeah, and jump on at the right time.

589
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.340
MATT: Okay, because only half of it is emerging,

590
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.532
it looks like a buzzsaw that's halfway put into a tree.

591
00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:26.768
So it's partially obscured by the tower.

592
00:24:26.768 --> 00:24:28.970
TRAVIS: Not the imagery we needed.

593
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.060
LIAM: So if we were to ride it up,

594
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.300
we would just ride it to a high place, and then--

595
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.070
MATT: Before it mashes you into its space into the tower.

596
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.680
MARISHA: But then we could theoretically jump over.

597
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.930
MATT: Yeah, you'd be 30 feet up when you do that.

598
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.970
MARISHA: I'm good at this shit, let me,

599
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.200
I've got Feather Fall and shit, not Feather Fall, but.

600
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.039
MATT: You have safe fall.

601
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.250
MARISHA: Slow Fall.
MATT: Slow Fall, okay.

602
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.190
MARISHA: So let me see, let me get up in here.

603
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.220
TALIESIN: Guidance.

604
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.270
SAM: Are you sure you don't want some help?

605
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.521
TRAVIS: I have the whip out, too.
MARISHA: I think I'm--

606
00:24:57.521 --> 00:25:00.270
MATT: You can hear the louder footsteps

607
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.194
of this entity getting closer.

608
00:25:02.194 --> 00:25:04.740
It's just above the lip,

609
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.140
you can hear its heavy footfalls hitting the metal atop

610
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.390
of you, it'll be down here in probably less than a minute.

611
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.223
What are you doing?
LAURA: Oh god.

612
00:25:11.223 --> 00:25:12.620
We should all just jump on.

613
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.070
We just got to jump, all of us just jump on a gear.

614
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.840
MARISHA: I'll go, and I can maybe try and help catch people?

615
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.190
I'm just, I'm going to go first.

616
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.270
MATT: Okay, so Beau, you leap up, go ahead and make,

617
00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.150
for just a straight jump, make an athletics check.

618
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.280
LIAM: Cocked.
MARISHA: Right?

619
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.050
LIAM: Cocked.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

620
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.265
Okay.
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.

621
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.790
MARISHA: 25.
SAM: Whoa.

622
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.280
MATT: You wait for the moment, and you leap,

623
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.290
and catch yourself about one foot from where,

624
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.220
you can now see, there's the two gears overlapping,

625
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.480
as you catch the lower part of the gear,

626
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.390
and try and wrap your fingers around part of the lip,

627
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.467
which has a slight groove cut into it.

628
00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:55.628
You grab onto it and look at the opposite side of this.

629
00:25:55.628 --> 00:25:58.470
There's about 14 other different sets of gears,

630
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.670
different speeds, that are all whirring into each other,

631
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.383
and it's just a massive machine.

632
00:26:03.383 --> 00:26:05.590
If you were to fall into there, it would eat you.

633
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.090
So you catch yourself, and start being lifted up

634
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:09.923
on that side.

635
00:26:09.923 --> 00:26:11.570
MARISHA: I think we're going to need another way,

636
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.050
another way, we've got to find another way.

637
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:13.980
SAM: Come down here, come down here.

638
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.005
MARISHA: I'm going to drop and

639
00:26:17.005 --> 00:26:18.880
back flip off of the forefront one.

640
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.530
TRAVIS: Approximately what's the distance across

641
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.380
that gear hell fuck--

642
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.650
MATT: It's about 10 feet or so of that.

643
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:25.877
MARISHA: 10 feet.
MATT: 10 feet.

644
00:26:25.877 --> 00:26:28.020
LAURA: We could potentially jump it, but--

645
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.853
SAM: Or fly?

646
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.943
Some of you can fly?
LAURA: We can Polymorph.

647
00:26:32.943 --> 00:26:34.060
MATT: What are you doing? You jump back

648
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.930
to where everyone is, or are you still holding on?

649
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.166
MARISHA: How much time do I have to hold on

650
00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:40.283
before I'm fucked?
MATT: You're now about halfway up,

651
00:26:40.283 --> 00:26:42.830
and 10 seconds, another 10 seconds before--

652
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.810
MARISHA: What are we deciding, 10 seconds.

653
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.310
I can also just drop and do this again, I guess.

654
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.980
LAURA: I'm Polymorphing into a giant owl,

655
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.910
and I'm grabbing up Nott and Caduceus--

656
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.160
MARISHA: I'm going to jump, I've got a little bit

657
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.960
of a gap before the hell, mechanical hell pit, right?

658
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.510
MATT: No, the hell pit begins right after the gear

659
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.530
that you're on. You couldn't see it

660
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.170
because it was blocking it until you got up there,

661
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.560
and you look down and saw it, yeah.

662
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.740
But you got 10-foot distance before the rest

663
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.580
of the lip continues.
SAM: Jump it, Beau!

664
00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.413
MATT: What are you doing, you're at the top now.

665
00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:12.090
MARISHA: I will--

666
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.330
MATT: As time slows, in the brief moment,

667
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.163
as you make this decision--

668
00:27:14.163 --> 00:27:14.996
MARISHA: I have a thing for this.

669
00:27:14.996 --> 00:27:16.120
LAURA: I've already polymorphed, and I'm flying

670
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.110
around the other side.
MARISHA: I am going to

671
00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.210
do--
MATT: Roll an initiative check

672
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.170
for me, this is just--
LIAM: I go over to Fjord,

673
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.480
say: Don't mind me. And I jump onto his back,

674
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.710
piggyback style, and turn into a giant eagle,

675
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.340
using my transmutation ability

676
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.300
that doesn't use a spell slot.

677
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.660
MATT: Okay, make an initiative check, as well.

678
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:37.080
LAURA: 20 for me.

679
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.054
LIAM: Nine.
MATT: Nine, okay.

680
00:27:39.054 --> 00:27:42.230
You Polymorph and grab who?
LAURA: Nott and Caduceus.

681
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.960
MATT: Nott and Caduceus.
LAURA: Because one's big, one's little.

682
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.970
MATT: You grab them and whoosh off of the side,

683
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.450
and as you curl up off the edge,

684
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.790
it's strange, as soon as you get up,

685
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.040
the gravity shifts a bit, and you're flung to the side.

686
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.370
As you get about 15 or so feet away

687
00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:01.030
from the tower, there is low gravity.

688
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.530
It seems to almost--
TALIESIN: Guidance.

689
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:05.360
MATT: You immediately start getting super discombobulated,

690
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.860
and your flight pattern gets to flap around a bit.

691
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.620
You go to cast it, and it doesn't work.

692
00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.270
You see the creature emerging,

693
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.320
its face, this large sigil of glowing blue,

694
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.780
where the rest of it's just featureless,

695
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.900
stone void with metallic bits beneath,

696
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.610
facing your direction, this faint blue glow.

697
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.790
You go to cast the spell, and nothing happens.

698
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.690
LIAM: That means I'm just piggybacking you right now.

699
00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:26.800
TRAVIS: That's fair.

700
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.250
MARISHA: I am going to think for a second.

701
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.070
TRAVIS: To who?

702
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.260
LAURA: Use it on the other side and then retract it,

703
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.810
and you can go across it with the whip.

704
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.390
TRAVIS: Yeah, myself.

705
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.260
LAURA: You've got Caleb on your back.

706
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.700
TRAVIS: Who do you think I am?

707
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.533
MATT: Beau, what are you doing?

708
00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:43.190
MARISHA: I'm casting Step of the Wind.

709
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.310
I'm going to spend a ki point and cast Step of the Wind,

710
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.430
and my jump distance is doubled for the turn.

711
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.330
So I'm going to do Step of the Wind,

712
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.990
I'm going to swing around to the other side of the gear.

713
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.570
MATT: Right as it reaches the top point.

714
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.740
MARISHA: Kind of, and I'm going to wait for the apex.

715
00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.100
MATT: It's right there already.

716
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.060
MARISHA: And then, like a swimmer vaulting off

717
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.870
of a pool, I'm going to jump and

718
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.090
do like a half turn flip gymnast shit.

719
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.310
MATT: You've got it, right as the lip begins to catch,

720
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.570
and you can see in that brief instant,

721
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.600
there's just enough of a gap to catch your hand,

722
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.810
and then pull you in and mash you

723
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.980
into whatever insides of the tower awaiting you,

724
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.950
and then at the last minute, you jump off,

725
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.620
swivel, back flip, arms spread,

726
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.390
keeping yourself as aerodynamic as possible.

727
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.940
MARISHA: Three quarter turn.
MATT: Right.

728
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.060
As you turn, the gravity shifts in mid-air,

729
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.380
right as you push off and begin

730
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.590
to find yourself rushing toward the tower.

731
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.840
Your feet catch the edge of the tower,

732
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.870
and you push off, and gravity catches you,

733
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.320
right as you hit towards the bottom,

734
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.310
and you land on the lip of the opposite side.

735
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.440
SAM: One of us will live.

736
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.110
MATT: You, (wings flapping)

737
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.010
flap and land over on the opposite side.

738
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.090
SAM: It worked.
LAURA: and SAM: (sighs of relief)

739
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.460
MATT: What are you guys doing?
LAURA: Yeah, I dropped them--

740
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.030
LIAM: How fast is time moving here?

741
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.430
I'll cast again if I can.

742
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.400
MATT: Okay, what do you cast?

743
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.695
LIAM: Fly on the two of us, 4th-level,

744
00:29:58.695 --> 00:30:00.320
so we both fly.
MATT: It doesn't work.

745
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.030
LIAM: Oh, no, okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's no magic here.

746
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.300
Fuck it.
MATT: You get the sense here,

747
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.450
as you go to do it, there's nothing.

748
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.585
It's not like the spell fails, there is no magic.

749
00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:10.020
TRAVIS: That fucking golem.

750
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.460
MATT: And there's just that faint blue light,

751
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.500
emitting in your direction.
LIAM: Okay.

752
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.290
MATT: Now it's going to go ahead

753
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.810
and make an attack against you, Caleb.

754
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.070
LIAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Oh, shit, golem's here.

755
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.060
MATT: That's a 23 to hits.

756
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.893
LIAM: Hits.

757
00:30:22.893 --> 00:30:25.290
SAM: So is it Fjord and Caleb against the golem right now?

758
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.427
MATT: Currently, yes, oh, sorry.

759
00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:32.500
Caleb, you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage,

760
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.070
and I need you to make a dexterity saving throw for me.

761
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.190
LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18, okay.

762
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.972
You watch as it has one large, hulking fist.

763
00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.810
That pulls back, and you're waiting

764
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.800
for this to come towards you, instead,

765
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.460
the clawed hand goes right for your throat.

766
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.580
It grabs and wraps around, and it crushes

767
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.780
your windpipe for a second, and you hear something

768
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.450
in it's moving, and you manage

769
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:05.470
to slip yourself out right as it clamps into place.

770
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.670
And you're free.

771
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.262
It's going to make its second attack. It's going to attempt

772
00:31:11.262 --> 00:31:14.110
to bludgeon you, since you're the one that's most,

773
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.750
with the other fist, it goes forward,

774
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.240
right towards your chest, Fjord,

775
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.417
that is going to be a 31 to hit.

776
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.634
TRAVIS: Is that a three-one?
MATT: Three-one, yeah.

777
00:31:26.634 --> 00:31:28.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, yeah.
MATT: Rolled really well.

778
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.330
TRAVIS: Yeah, it did.
TALIESIN: I hope so.

779
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.280
TRAVIS: That sort of removes any suspicion of staying

780
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.113
and fighting this thing--

781
00:31:34.113 --> 00:31:35.900
MATT: 22 points of bludgeoning damage.

782
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.733
TRAVIS: Okay.

783
00:31:36.733 --> 00:31:37.660
TALIESIN: This is why we took a rest.

784
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.460
MATT: That's it.

785
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.230
It rears its arms back once more.

786
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.340
You can see the claw in its hand rotate,

787
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.860
click into place to where it was previously,

788
00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.910
and preparing itself.

789
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.300
You go ahead and roll initiative now

790
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.680
that you're in this moment here.

791
00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.540
TRAVIS: Nine.

792
00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.440
MATT: Okay, you have not gone yet,

793
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.820
so you get to take your turn.

794
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.120
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm going to take out the dispelling stone,

795
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.960
and I'm going to throw it as hard as I can

796
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.710
into its glowing blue face.

797
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.040
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Holy fuck.

798
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.600
MATT: You chuck it at its face.

799
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.208
(crashing)

800
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.530
The stone just looks like a dull rock when you threw it.

801
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.800
TRAVIS: Cool.
(laughter)

802
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.660
Right, right, cool, yeah.

803
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:33.120
Cool, I'm jumping on the gear, and I'm running to the gear.

804
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.410
MATT: Okay, and you're holding on?

805
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.287
LIAM: Holding on?

806
00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:37.890
MATT: To Fjord, still, on his back?

807
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.700
LIAM: For sure.
MATT: Okay.

808
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.260
New round of combat, you turn and start rushing

809
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.650
towards the gear, it begins lunging behind you.

810
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.200
It's going to reach up and attempt to grab you

811
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.180
by the back of the throat.

812
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.160
Caleb, actually, no, because Caleb,

813
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.070
you're on his back, so it's going to go for yours.

814
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.660
LAURA: Did we get any initiative on the other side?

815
00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.890
MATT: You guys have just landed, and you don't even know

816
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.600
what's happening on the other end.

817
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.470
LAURA: Okay, but we saw him coming up,

818
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:02.390
we saw the golem coming up.

819
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.530
MATT: You saw him approaching quickly.

820
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.363
LAURA: Okay.

821
00:33:04.363 --> 00:33:07.240
MATT: After this round, I will say that you noticed

822
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.200
that they haven't followed suit yet.

823
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.170
So after this next round

824
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.122
because this is all happening very quickly.

825
00:33:12.122 --> 00:33:14.915
It's going to attempt to attack you from behind.

826
00:33:14.915 --> 00:33:18.190
That is going to be a 23 to hit.

827
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:19.106
LIAM: <i>Ja, natürlich.</i>

828
00:33:19.106 --> 00:33:21.950
MATT: All right, you take

829
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.370
11 points of bludgeoning damage,

830
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.841
and make another dexterity saving throw.

831
00:33:26.841 --> 00:33:27.880
LAURA: God.

832
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.368
LIAM: So that's...

833
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.120
15, does that fail?
MATT: That does.

834
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.395
LIAM: I'll use the ring of evasion,

835
00:33:36.395 --> 00:33:38.153
a charge to succeed instead.

836
00:33:38.153 --> 00:33:41.110
MATT: Okay, as it clamps around your throat,

837
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.120
you can see now where the two parts

838
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.120
of the claw snap together, two smaller little rings whir

839
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.480
around it, and close it around your throat.

840
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.530
You invoke the ring, and for a split second,

841
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.480
you feel your bones become gelatinous,

842
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.390
and you squeeze yourself out from inside.

843
00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.047
The magic then releasing you,

844
00:34:00.047 --> 00:34:01.950
and it's a little uncomfortable,

845
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.750
but you are free from its claw.

846
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.260
You can now see, as it pulls its hand back,

847
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.200
the collar that it attempted to affix

848
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.350
to your neck just tumbles off the side, and into the void.

849
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.600
Where its arm was, you watch as it,

850
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.520
well, for now, that's what you see.

851
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.430
It's going to attempt to punch you in the back,

852
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.790
because you're currently what's in its way.

853
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.790
That's going to be a

854
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.440
28 to hit.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I think so.

855
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.940
MARISHA: Ring of evasion.
LAURA: I know, the ring of evasion.

856
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.070
So things on our body are, maybe, not dispelled--

857
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.770
MARISHA: Are fine?
TRAVIS: I don't know.

858
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.860
I don't even want to ask.

859
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:38.620
MATT: Actually, no, you have the ring of evasion.

860
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.710
LIAM: So it failed, so it's got--

861
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.650
MATT: So in that brief, thank you for the reminder, then.

862
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.380
LAURA: Shit.
LIAM: Thanks, Laura.

863
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.610
MATT: So in that brief minute, where you're like,

864
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.610
"This would have been cool if it worked,"

865
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:48.970
the alternate reality, as you're now,

866
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:50.100
you're used to looking into weird realities

867
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.188
with dunamancy, you're like, "That would have been cool,"

868
00:34:52.188 --> 00:34:56.058
Back in this moment.
(laughter)

869
00:34:56.058 --> 00:34:57.316
TRAVIS: The old Sherlock Holmes.

870
00:34:57.316 --> 00:34:58.149
MATT: The collar.

871
00:34:58.149 --> 00:34:59.560
LAURA: If you were wearing it, maybe it didn't--

872
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.738
LIAM: No, I want to see what happens.

873
00:35:01.738 --> 00:35:03.640
MATT: The collar snaps closed around your throat,

874
00:35:05.082 --> 00:35:07.000
and then you get punched, and that's your turn.

875
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.840
Now, that's its turn, you guys both go

876
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.673
at the same time, what do you--

877
00:35:09.673 --> 00:35:11.064
LIAM: Same amount of damage, correct?

878
00:35:11.064 --> 00:35:12.100
MATT: Correct.

879
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.140
LIAM: Am I fastened to the thing?

880
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.940
MATT: No, the claw actually, or the collar detaches,

881
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.040
and it just stays around your neck.

882
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.520
LAURA: You have a collar on your neck.

883
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.220
MATT: Like a metallic collar.

884
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.710
TRAVIS: Is it free, attached to a wire,
is he still holding it?

885
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.543
It's just a collar around--

886
00:35:25.543 --> 00:35:26.810
MATT: Just a collar around his neck, and it's free.

887
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.100
TRAVIS: Metal?

888
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.660
MATT: It's metal.
TRAVIS: Color?

889
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.248
MATT: Kind of like a dull, steel-brushed silver.

890
00:35:34.248 --> 00:35:36.442
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

891
00:35:36.442 --> 00:35:37.683
TRAVIS: Okay.

892
00:35:39.222 --> 00:35:40.250
MATT: What are you guys doing?

893
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.710
LAURA: Get the fuck away, keep going.

894
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.230
LIAM: Scrambling up into the gears.

895
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.170
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Are we there?

896
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.860
MATT: So you're helping him. Go ahead

897
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.320
and make an athletics check with advantage,

898
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.640
because Caleb's helping you.

899
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.920
LAURA: Caleb's holding on real tight.

900
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.753
TRAVIS: Go on, you can do it, Fjord,

901
00:35:53.753 --> 00:35:55.320
you've got to climb it.
TRAVIS: 16.

902
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.190
MATT: 16?
TRAVIS: No, no, 20.

903
00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.790
MATT: 20! You leap up, and as the fist pulls back,

904
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.430
it actually, as it slams its fist into your back,

905
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.910
it gives you a little more weight.

906
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.740
It hurts, but if gives you the extra push.

907
00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.060
You end up being elevated to

908
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.960
about halfway up the second gear.

909
00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.020
You hold onto it, your feet dangle for a minute,

910
00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.450
and you feel the gravity fighting in weird ways,

911
00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.003
and you hold on with him.

912
00:36:15.003 --> 00:36:17.534
(gears clacking)

913
00:36:17.534 --> 00:36:18.390
TRAVIS: As we're going up,

914
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.520
I'm trying to understand, there's 10 feet

915
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.710
of horrible mechanical death.
MATT: Horrible grinding metal.

916
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.500
TRAVIS: Then above us is,

917
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.170
can we see our friends, or no?

918
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.730
MATT: You can, and you guys, at this point,

919
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.890
see now Caleb and Fjord leaping up,

920
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.590
and holding onto the side of this gear.

921
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.460
SAM: See, they're fine, they're right there, look.

922
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.850
TRAVIS: Is there anything above us,

923
00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.756
like if there's horrible imminent death here, anything?

924
00:36:40.756 --> 00:36:41.589
MATT: Nope.

925
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:43.850
LAURA: Just getting squished into the building.

926
00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.410
MATT: Up above you, yeah, there's the area

927
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.220
where the giant gear pushes into the building,

928
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.480
and there's just enough gap there to grab somebody

929
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.820
and drag them in, and there's about 25,

930
00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.590
or 30 feet above you before the lip

931
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.730
that you guys had run down previously is above you.

932
00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.150
TRAVIS: No, that's too far.

933
00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.150
LAURA: Oh, wait, it's not my turn yet.

934
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.360
MATT: It is now, because you guys now see them leap up,

935
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.600
and you haven't taken any action yet.

936
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.073
LAURA: So I'm going to fly up in the air

937
00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.577
and I'm not going to come close.

938
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.510
But I want to fly up in the air and be

939
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.480
at the ready, so that I can snag them

940
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.860
if they go to jump to the lip,

941
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.120
so I can catch them in my talons.

942
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.390
MATT: So you're holding your action.

943
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.430
LAURA: To catch them.
MATT: You fly over there,

944
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.280
and then hold your action, that if they end up falling,

945
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.500
you can retrieve them.
LAURA: Yeah.

946
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.200
MATT: You got it, anybody else doing anything?

947
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.840
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bless on you, you, and you.

948
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.690
Does it work?
MATT: The range on them is?

949
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.460
TALIESIN: The blange is 30 feet.
MATT: 30 feet?

950
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.674
LAURA: The blange is 30 feet.

951
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:43.360
MATT: All right, so you have to get close.

952
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.330
MATT: They're within 30 feet right now,
right, because they're--

953
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.480
MATT: If you move up a little bit,

954
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.530
yeah, they're within 30 feet, okay.

955
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.579
TALIESIN: And then hit that, and does it work?

956
00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:50.390
MATT: Nope.
TALIESIN: It doesn't work?

957
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.380
Do I burn a spell slot, though, or is just--

958
00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.900
MATT: Spell slots are burned when you do this,

959
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.733
they just don't work.

960
00:37:55.733 --> 00:37:57.130
TALIESIN: So it's not in the view of this creature,

961
00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.450
that's good to know.

962
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.450
LAURA: So if you're in the view of the-- I'm confused.

963
00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:03.270
TALIESIN: No, it's just, everything, nothing's working,

964
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.780
nothing's working.
TRAVIS: Bless didn't work?

965
00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.180
TALIESIN: Yeah.

966
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.030
LAURA: Would I not be an owl anymore, then?

967
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.020
MATT: You've moved around, up to the side.

968
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.520
It's approached at this point.

969
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.020
TALIESIN: Okay.

970
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.591
MATT: Yeah, all right.

971
00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:17.840
All right, without putting a full battlefield down

972
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.600
for this scenario here,

973
00:38:23.443 --> 00:38:24.780
the rules are a little weird about this.

974
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.840
I would say,

975
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:28.810
let me check one thing real fast.

976
00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.730
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was kind of curious if

977
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.790
this would work, yeah.

978
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.381
LIAM: In the meantime, though.

979
00:38:36.381 --> 00:38:38.089
SAM: Ugh!

980
00:38:39.373 --> 00:38:40.660
LAURA: Did it hit your eyeball?

981
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.020
LIAM: Do you want me to even you off?
MARISHA: I heard that!

982
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.020
LAURA: His eyeball, don't hit his other eyeball.

983
00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:52.220
TRAVIS: I think it's all swollen.

984
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.350
MARISHA: It looks red, are you okay?

985
00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.100
TALIESIN: All of this makes me sad.
SAM: It's already red.

986
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.301
MARISHA: No, I'm real bad at this game, I'm real bad.

987
00:39:00.301 --> 00:39:02.720
SAM: These fuckers--
MATT: I would say yes,

988
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.430
the spell does not work, when you land

989
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.100
on the other side and put them down,

990
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.160
you were a little ways away, that's why

991
00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.510
you had to move up to cast your spell.

992
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.420
Your spell does not work, but you are still polymorphed.

993
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.870
LAURA: Okay, got it.
TALIESIN: All right.

994
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.370
That was all I got.

995
00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.870
MATT: So you prepare yourself, anybody else?

996
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.300
You land on the other side and catch yourself,

997
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.710
and see them holding onto it.

998
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.640
MARISHA: Three-point leading, that was awesome.

999
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.900
SAM: I can't do anything, I will just take a big swig

1000
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.110
of alcohol.
MATT: You got it.

1001
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.143
TRAVIS: I'm going to turn to Caleb and go:

1002
00:39:29.143 --> 00:39:30.584
We may have to jump,

1003
00:39:30.584 --> 00:39:33.730
this thing might be our only hope.

1004
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.330
LIAM: Are we going to die up here?

1005
00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.530
MATT: Okay, as you guys are,

1006
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.020
below, you can see where the rune is,

1007
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.180
it's blue, it shifts to green.
TRAVIS: What?

1008
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:48.180
MATT: Then this greenish black cloud

1009
00:39:48.742 --> 00:39:52.100
rises up in your direction. I need both of you guys

1010
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.510
to roll constitution saving throws for me.

1011
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:58.320
LAURA: Jesus H., what?
TRAVIS: (nervous, high-pitched laugh)

1012
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.930
LAURA: Did I already eat all my marshmallow?

1013
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.260
I'm stress eating.

1014
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.470
Give me marshmallow.

1015
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.870
TRAVIS: 21.
MATT: Good.

1016
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.070
SAM: Throw it in her mouth.

1017
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.280
I don't have any rope.

1018
00:40:09.241 --> 00:40:11.049
TRAVIS: The colors change?!

1019
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.410
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1020
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.820
MARISHA: It bounced off your nose, it was so cute.

1021
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.720
LIAM: 22.
MATT: 22, okay.

1022
00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.080
You both succeed.
MARISHA: Woo, woo!

1023
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.650
TALIESIN: So yeah, no sleep tonight either, that's good.

1024
00:40:33.265 --> 00:40:36.060
Just an adrenaline dump, yay.

1025
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.443
MATT: All right, you guys both take

1026
00:40:39.443 --> 00:40:41.210
27 points of poison damage.

1027
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.280
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1028
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.600
That's a save.
MATT: Yeah.

1029
00:40:45.163 --> 00:40:48.570
LIAM: There's no effect.
TRAVIS: Fuck this thing.

1030
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.420
Holy shit.
MATT: It's your turn.

1031
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.810
What are you doing?
SAM: Wait.

1032
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:51.643
TRAVIS: Whose turn?

1033
00:40:51.643 --> 00:40:53.450
MATT: Your guy's turn.
SAM: Does magic work now, maybe?

1034
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.040
LIAM: How far away is the rest of the group

1035
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.340
from where we are? Do we see them at the top of the gears?

1036
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.510
MATT: Right now, Caduceus is about 15, 20 feet

1037
00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.430
from you on the other side of the gears.

1038
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.980
Jester you saw fly off, and is off to the side,

1039
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.320
a little below, maybe about 50,

1040
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.650
60 feet off to the side there,

1041
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:09.940
and Beauregard and Nott are waiting behind Caduceus.

1042
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.273
LIAM: And Jester is an owl where she is?
MATT: Correct.

1043
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.790
LIAM: I'm going to dive towards Jester and free fall.

1044
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.200
MATT: Okay, Caleb leaps off of your body,

1045
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.640
out towards where Jester is.

1046
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.530
LIAM: And when I get within maybe 10 or 15 feet,

1047
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.210
I am going to turn myself into a raven.

1048
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.540
MATT: Okay, what are you doing, you guys are

1049
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.770
on the same initiative order.

1050
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.350
TRAVIS: I'm going to see what happens to him.

1051
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.566
LAURA: I was waiting to save you guys.

1052
00:41:38.566 --> 00:41:40.479
(bird cawing)

1053
00:41:40.479 --> 00:41:41.770
I don't know what giant owls make.

1054
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.410
MATT: You're waiting, you watch Caleb leap off

1055
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.290
of you as you're being lifted up higher,

1056
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.950
higher with the gear, Caleb just leaps off,

1057
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:52.300
plummets down, and then turns into a tiny raven.

1058
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.830
TRAVIS: I jump, too.

1059
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:58.830
MATT: Fjord leaps, as well, off to the side, free fall.

1060
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.340
LAURA: I use my, I'm saving my action to save him.

1061
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.980
MATT: Yep, you dive down and catch him

1062
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.690
at his falling rate, manage to scoop up Fjord,

1063
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.490
right as you catch up with her as the raven.

1064
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.590
LIAM: Question.
MATT: Yes?

1065
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.910
LIAM: Where is the collar?
MATT: Where is the what?

1066
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.770
LIAM: The collar around Caleb's neck.

1067
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.240
MATT: Oh, that's right, because you're--

1068
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.280
LIAM: Certainly doesn't have time to attune to it.

1069
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.680
MATT: No, what spell were you casting?

1070
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.210
LIAM: Polymorph.
MATT: Polymorph, yeah.

1071
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:23.680
Doesn't work.
LIAM: When I got close to her.

1072
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.480
Even though he did it when he's where she is?

1073
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.360
TRAVIS: It's the--
MARISHA: The collar.

1074
00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.160
MATT: You go to try and speak the spell.

1075
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.730
LAURA: Wait, but so--
MATT: But you were waiting

1076
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:34.970
for both, you catch both of them.

1077
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.170
You watch as Caleb leaps, and you leap after Caleb,

1078
00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.670
and Caleb comes to a spell, and looks confused

1079
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.530
for a second, and you swoop up both of them.

1080
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:44.363
LIAM: Brutal.

1081
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.610
TALIESIN: We're going to run full speed towards this gate,

1082
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:49.700
I assume.
LAURA: Yeah.

1083
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.010
We're going to the gate.

1084
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.790
MATT: You guys begin rushing down.
MARISHA: Hey, Nott?

1085
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.450
SAM: What?

1086
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:55.810
MARISHA: Can I have some of that flask?

1087
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.210
SAM: Yes.
MARISHA: Thank you.

1088
00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.443
LAURA: As you're running?

1089
00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:00.901
MARISHA: Yeah, glug glug glug glug glug!

1090
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.510
MATT: Okay, so.

1091
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.280
The rest of you are rushing down,

1092
00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.980
down the side of the tower, heading in that direction.

1093
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
You guys just fly down to where that island is.

1094
00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.158
TRAVIS: (excited laughter)

1095
00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:23.650
TALIESIN: I'm still not okay with any of this.

1096
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:24.820
SAM: I don't know what's happening,

1097
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.520
but whatever it is is brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

1098
00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.753
Check out the latest--

1099
00:43:29.753 --> 00:43:31.280
LAURA: That kind of looks like a dick.

1100
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.380
SAM: It does, check out the latest and greatest

1101
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.900
from Dwarven Forge at dwarvenforge.com.

1102
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.120
But I legitimately don't know

1103
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.341
what they're sponsoring right now.

1104
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:42.270
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Ooh!

1105
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.120
LAURA: There's lights, I see lights.

1106
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.820
TALIESIN: Oh, that's never a good sign.

1107
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.790
SAM: There's Dwarven Forge!

1108
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.440
LAURA: The island that was floating?

1109
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.060
MATT: Yes.

1110
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.400
SAM: It's a void.
LAURA: The floating island

1111
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.740
has a door?

1112
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.050
SAM: Wait.
LAURA: Holy moly.

1113
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.640
SAM: Wait, there's an island somewhere, what?

1114
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.680
LAURA: The island has the door.
LIAM: This is void.

1115
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.920
SAM: Wait, we're on this tower?

1116
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.920
MATT: You are flying down, currently holding Fjord

1117
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:08.230
and--
LAURA: Oh, Fjord and Caleb,

1118
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.890
that's right.
MATT: Fjord and Caleb right there,

1119
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:16.670
while you guys are rushing your way down the lip

1120
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:18.710
of the tower. You guys are much faster.

1121
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:19.730
As you're heading down the side,

1122
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.800
you can see, there are these mechanical pieces

1123
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.230
of the tower where it seems like

1124
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.010
that same crackling blue type energy

1125
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.230
that you see flashing off in the distant storm,

1126
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.700
seems to be whirring and spinning,

1127
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.880
like it's powering the machine,

1128
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.050
or it's keeping energy at bay.

1129
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.570
You're not sure what the functionality is

1130
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.840
of these devices, but they begin to line the side lip

1131
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.620
of this tower as it curves downward.

1132
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.380
As you guys are running down, you can see Jester swoop down,

1133
00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.570
and you, if you'd like to land on the island?

1134
00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:46.310
LAURA: Yeah, I'll drop them off on the island,

1135
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:48.690
and then I'll try to run over and grab the other peeps.

1136
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:53.600
MATT: Okay, you head over, drop them off, begin

1137
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.790
to head this direction. You guys head over

1138
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.110
towards the edge here, and as you look over

1139
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.580
towards Jester, you see this strange blue spark,

1140
00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.260
off in the upper left hand corner.

1141
00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.160
You see, coming around the corner,

1142
00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.860
the golem entity, with two arcane flame jets coming out

1143
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.901
of the bottom of the feet.

1144
00:45:10.901 --> 00:45:14.242
SAM: He's got jet packs!
LIAM: It's Iron Man!

1145
00:45:14.242 --> 00:45:17.437
LAURA: Are you fucking kidding me?!

1146
00:45:17.437 --> 00:45:19.920
SAM: What?!

1147
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.021
LAURA: What!

1148
00:45:21.021 --> 00:45:24.820
MARISHA: That's cool.
LAURA: Oh god.

1149
00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.510
Why is he so bad? But if we go in this door--

1150
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.320
MARISHA: He's still going to follow.

1151
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.290
LAURA: He's going to, and then we're in a room with no exit.

1152
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.610
SAM: We've got to stop him from getting over here.

1153
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.320
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1154
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.814
MATT: He is heading--
TRAVIS: ♪ He can fly, he can fly ♪

1155
00:45:43.814 --> 00:45:46.620
MATT: -- in this direction, he's starting to catch up

1156
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.560
with you guys.
LAURA: Oh, he's heavy.

1157
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.890
MATT: He is, I couldn't hold--

1158
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:50.800
LAURA: Whoa!
(piece clatters)

1159
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.310
SAM: Oh fucking--

1160
00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.700
MATT: I lost, I don't know where the other top

1161
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.280
of this piece went right now.

1162
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.950
TRAVIS: I'll balance him.

1163
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.850
MATT: It's fine, it's fine, go for it.

1164
00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.046
Anyway, let's roll initiative once more.

1165
00:46:06.046 --> 00:46:11.037
LAURA: God.
MARISHA: Initiative.

1166
00:46:11.037 --> 00:46:13.910
LAURA: All right, I get a fear of all my dice

1167
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.620
as soon as we start anything terrible.

1168
00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:20.620
SAM: Well, they're all terrible.
LAURA: Shut up! It was good!

1169
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.740
MATT: 25 to 20?
LAURA: 20.

1170
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.640
MATT: 20 to 15?
MARISHA: 16.

1171
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.040
SAM: 16.
MATT: Ooh.

1172
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.057
LAURA: What color is the golem's face right now?

1173
00:46:32.057 --> 00:46:34.620
Is it still green?
MATT: No, blue now.

1174
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.360
MARISHA: Back to blue?

1175
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.390
MATT: Yes, it's back to blue.

1176
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.480
TRAVIS: That means his boosters are

1177
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.062
actually mechanical or something.

1178
00:46:41.962 --> 00:46:43.812
SAM: Jesus.

1179
00:46:43.812 --> 00:46:45.287
I want those boosters.

1180
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.990
TRAVIS: You want those boots?
SAM: Yeah.

1181
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.790
MATT: That brings us to 15 to 10?
LIAM: 11.

1182
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.760
TRAVIS: 10.
MATT: All right.

1183
00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.330
SAM: If we got one of those, one of his feet,

1184
00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:00.110
I could probably use that as a jet pack.

1185
00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:04.300
LAURA: What's the order?
MARISHA: (laughs)

1186
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.769
MATT: Jester, you're up first. You can see it

1187
00:47:07.819 --> 00:47:10.880
heading in the direction of you guys, generally.

1188
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.694
He's the bottom.
TRAVIS: Okay.

1189
00:47:13.694 --> 00:47:14.680
MATT: What do you do, Jester?

1190
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:18.960
LAURA: I feel like if I get us in the air,

1191
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.085
it's going to probably be bad.

1192
00:47:21.085 --> 00:47:25.720
(groaning)

1193
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.940
I'm going to fly and try to be on the same side, over here.

1194
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.950
MATT: Okay, what's the speed on your owl?

1195
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.930
LAURA: (scared whimpering)

1196
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.180
That's a good question.

1197
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.780
MARISHA: What if it's a closet, what if it's like a pantry,

1198
00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.855
and we're just fucking stuck?
LAURA: 60 feet.

1199
00:47:41.855 --> 00:47:45.066
MATT: So what's it, 60?
LAURA: 60.

1200
00:47:45.066 --> 00:47:46.720
MATT: So let's see here, distance wise, you can--

1201
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.910
LAURA: Even though I made myself an owl

1202
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.240
and not an eagle, but whatever.

1203
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.490
MATT: So 60, you can go over here,

1204
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.560
at 50 feet, and be there fine.

1205
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.940
LAURA: That's 50, was that 50?
MATT: Yeah.

1206
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.650
You still have 10 feet of movement from here.

1207
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.630
LAURA: I guess I'm going to--

1208
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.130
if I went, would I be able to make it

1209
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.924
to the top of the ledge right there?

1210
00:48:06.924 --> 00:48:09.799
MATT: You could. This represents the tower wall.

1211
00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:11.674
LAURA: Oh, okay, that's not an actual lip.

1212
00:48:11.674 --> 00:48:12.750
MATT: Yeah.

1213
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.670
LAURA: Then I'm going to go 10 feet further away than--

1214
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:17.960
MATT: This way?
LAURA: Yeah.

1215
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.200
MATT: Okay, that's your movement, you still have an action.

1216
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.230
If you want to hold your action, it's up to you.

1217
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.457
LAURA: I guess I'll hold-- oh god.

1218
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.770
I can't cast spells when I'm an owl, though.

1219
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.020
TALIESIN: Well, there's no spells, anyway.

1220
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.253
LAURA: Yeah.

1221
00:48:35.354 --> 00:48:38.613
I guess I'll drop the owl form.

1222
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.150
MATT: You drop the owl form?

1223
00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:43.183
Up to you.

1224
00:48:44.025 --> 00:48:46.320
LAURA: (nervous laughing)

1225
00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.480
LIAM: Yeah, do it, if that's what you thought.

1226
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.650
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to drop the owl form,

1227
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.870
and ready my ax, just in case.

1228
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:52.290
TRAVIS: Yeah, move confidently in the direction

1229
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.655
of your dreams.
MATT: There you go.

1230
00:48:54.655 --> 00:48:56.200
So there.
(laughter)

1231
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.540
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

1232
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.560
MATT: All right.

1233
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.640
Finishing Jester's turn. So you drop the form,

1234
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.010
that doesn't take an action. You still have an action.

1235
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:07.220
LAURA: Okay, then.
MARISHA: (whispering) Are we fighting this bitch?

1236
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:10.013
LAURA: Fucking hell, I don't know what I'm doing.

1237
00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:11.488
TRAVIS: Can you Banish him?

1238
00:49:11.488 --> 00:49:12.696
LAURA: Huh?
TRAVIS: No, if you're running

1239
00:49:12.696 --> 00:49:13.529
to blue face, don't listen to me.

1240
00:49:13.529 --> 00:49:14.870
LAURA: But I'm far enough away

1241
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.160
that maybe I could do a spell,

1242
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.940
and it won't do anything?
SAM: Sure, why not?

1243
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.220
MARISHA: I mean, you could do a cantrip,

1244
00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.350
and just test the radius.

1245
00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:22.658
LAURA: Oh god.

1246
00:49:22.658 --> 00:49:24.083
TRAVIS: He will close the distance

1247
00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:25.500
before you--
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1248
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.250
LAURA: Shit.
LIAM: Closing the distance.

1249
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.800
LAURA: Don't-- why am I first?! Oh god,

1250
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.170
I'm so nervous.

1251
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.920
LIAM: She's all alone.
MARISHA: All alone.

1252
00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.164
MATT: Time's closing, what are you doing?

1253
00:49:35.164 --> 00:49:35.997
TALIESIN: In a time of need.

1254
00:49:35.997 --> 00:49:37.563
SAM: (singing)

1255
00:49:37.563 --> 00:49:41.300
LAURA: I'm going to cast

1256
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.390
Spacred Flame at him.

1257
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:46.580
SAM: Spacred Flame.

1258
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.430
MATT: Spancred Flame.
LAURA: I'm going to Spacred Flame him.

1259
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.470
MATT: All right, is that a dexterity saving throw?

1260
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:51.753
LAURA: What's the blange on that?

1261
00:49:51.753 --> 00:49:54.200
(laughter)

1262
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.620
LAURA: I'm not going to Spacred Flame
him because it's 60 feet.

1263
00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.825
MATT: Yeah, you're not close enough, unfortunately.

1264
00:49:59.825 --> 00:50:01.001
LIAM: Should have done it at 4th-level.

1265
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:04.968
LAURA: Yeah, I should have. (laughs)

1266
00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:07.360
(laughter)

1267
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.740
LAURA: I'm going to--

1268
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:12.230
everything's going to be canceled the minute he gets

1269
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.630
to me, so it doesn't make any sense

1270
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.300
for me to waste a spell right now.

1271
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.641
MATT: Okay, so you're just going to hold,
you're just going to--

1272
00:50:16.641 --> 00:50:17.691
LIAM: Do something, tief.

1273
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.640
SAM: Hold your action.
LAURA: I'm going to hold,

1274
00:50:23.547 --> 00:50:25.170
I'm going to hold my spell

1275
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.790
of--

1276
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:35.660
I'm going to hold Duplicity. I'm going to hold Duplicity,

1277
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.360
for if he is not blue.

1278
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.060
MATT: Okay, you got it, all right.

1279
00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.340
That ends your turn. Now, the--

1280
00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.930
LAURA: That's the stupidest. I'm so dumb.

1281
00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:45.420
MATT: At the 20 count--
LAURA: Don't judge me, internet.

1282
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.656
Okay.
MARISHA: (laughs)

1283
00:50:47.656 --> 00:50:49.500
MATT: 10 feet that way.
SAM: What!

1284
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.800
MATT: It's slowly moving.
SAM: How about an iceberg.

1285
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.750
MATT: It's now the golem's turn.
LAURA: I figured that the owl would drop

1286
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.090
if he got close enough anyway,

1287
00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.520
and then I didn't want to be in the air.
SAM: I support you.

1288
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.420
I totally support you.
TRAVIS: Where's he going?

1289
00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.830
MATT: You do notice his movement.

1290
00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.122
He doesn't move very fast.

1291
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.650
At this point, he's about equal with you guys,

1292
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.730
but he's a heavy thing. Whatever it is

1293
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.070
that's powering this, you don't know

1294
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.100
what the energy source is, and it's mainly just the feet,

1295
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.480
and gravity itself that's fighting with it.

1296
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.850
It's doing it at a weird angle

1297
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:22.840
as it's (humming) around the side,

1298
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.310
but it's moving slowly.

1299
00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.443
As it does so, it's going to--

1300
00:51:27.443 --> 00:51:29.470
SAM: Oh, boy.
TRAVIS: Whoa!

1301
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.200
Whoa, grab a smaller one.

1302
00:51:32.104 --> 00:51:34.640
Grab a smaller one!
(screaming)

1303
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.310
MATT: So--
LAURA: Caleb's out of it, right?

1304
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:38.997
MATT: Nope.
LAURA: He was in it?

1305
00:51:38.997 --> 00:51:39.830
MARISHA: Oh no.

1306
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.240
LAURA: He's out of it now.

1307
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:45.740
MATT: But you do notice, as the head turns

1308
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.350
towards the island where they are,

1309
00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.970
and that blue light, against the storm,

1310
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.320
it gives off-- you can visualize now

1311
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.420
that you know what you're looking for--

1312
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.240
the faint bit of blue light that's coming out of it,

1313
00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.990
in that big radius, it's a cone in front of its face.

1314
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.790
As soon as it washes over the island,

1315
00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:01.610
the sparkling doorway, which, as you guys land

1316
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:02.990
and look at it, it's this

1317
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:05.420
shifting purple shimmer,

1318
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.870
it blinks out, and it's just an empty archway.

1319
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.110
LAURA: But it's only if he's looking at it.

1320
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.170
LIAM: It's a ray.

1321
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.420
TRAVIS: Yeah, we needed that door, though.

1322
00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.390
SAM: It'll come back.

1323
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.680
LAURA: It'll come back as soon as he goes away.

1324
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.540
MARISHA: Yeah, we just got to get his attention.

1325
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:21.540
MATT: As its other action, it's going to fly over 15 feet,

1326
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.790
this direction.
MARISHA: Fuck!

1327
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.623
LAURA: Fuck.
MARISHA: 15 feet?

1328
00:52:23.623 --> 00:52:26.210
SAM: I thought was just-- oh, fuck, I could stayed an owl.

1329
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.934
I could have stayed an owl!

1330
00:52:28.934 --> 00:52:32.180
TRAVIS: Matthew!
MATT: What?

1331
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.780
All right, Caleb, you're up.

1332
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.130
LIAM: I pull my transmuter stone out my pouch,

1333
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:39.900
and then start hammering it on this
collar, trying to break it.

1334
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.260
MATT: Okay. (impacts) You got it.

1335
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.720
LIAM: That's it.
MATT: All right.

1336
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.760
You going to move, or stay put?

1337
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.510
LIAM: Where is there to go?
MATT: I don't know.

1338
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.760
LIAM: We're on a rock. I'll go to the furthest edge

1339
00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.120
that way.
MATT: Okay, there you go.

1340
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.070
All right.
LAURA: Oh god.

1341
00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:52.610
LIAM: I'll go to this corner.

1342
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:54.740
MATT: There you go, okay.

1343
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.900
That finishes Caleb's go.

1344
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.980
Oh, sorry, no, sorry, it's Beau and Nott now, sorry, my bad.

1345
00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.868
MARISHA: Was Caleb after Jester, is that what?

1346
00:53:01.868 --> 00:53:04.380
LIAM: No, I misread it, sorry.
MARISHA: Okay, no worries.

1347
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.740
MATT: It's the golem, then Beau and Nott,

1348
00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.543
and then it's Caleb.

1349
00:53:08.543 --> 00:53:09.620
MARISHA: No, it's awesome.

1350
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.710
LAURA: That would have been really good information

1351
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.590
to have before my--

1352
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.770
MATT: I know, but you're just learning things as you begin

1353
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:18.310
to see the creature. This is the first time

1354
00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:20.700
you really saw it, was this moment.

1355
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.800
MARISHA: How far away is he from us right now?

1356
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.860
Or from the island?

1357
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.510
MATT: You could estimate somewhere between 50 to 60 feet.

1358
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.220
MARISHA: All right.
SAM: Can't get over there.

1359
00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.780
LIAM: I haven't got shit.

1360
00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:38.490
MARISHA: I'm going to rub my palms together

1361
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.500
and then activate my maelstrom gloves.

1362
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.570
MATT: Okay. Now you can see the lightning charging

1363
00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:47.580
through them. As you slam your fists together,

1364
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.390
and the lightning begins to charge around them,

1365
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.520
the energy device that's behind you that's

1366
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:56.510
whirring, you watch the purple lightning begin

1367
00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:00.050
to arc between your gloves and the device.

1368
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:05.050
And you do take two points of lightning damage,

1369
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.460
but the gloves now are thrumming in power.

1370
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.331
MARISHA: Whoa!

1371
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:13.590
Do I have an attack?

1372
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.070
TRAVIS: Just need somebody to punch.

1373
00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:16.170
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to

1374
00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:21.020
Hadouken chi charge this, and I want

1375
00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.250
to hold my action until he gets within 20 feet of me,

1376
00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:26.400
and then I'm going to blast him with some lightning.

1377
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.314
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Up the butt.

1378
00:54:27.314 --> 00:54:29.160
LIAM: Hadouken.
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

1379
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.889
Okay, so you're moving to the edge and holding your action?

1380
00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:32.722
Is that what you're doing?

1381
00:54:32.722 --> 00:54:33.710
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Okay.

1382
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:37.264
That finishes your turn. Nott, what are you doing?

1383
00:54:37.264 --> 00:54:39.530
SAM: I mean, we can't hurt this thing, can we?

1384
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:40.640
It's got a million hit points.

1385
00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.920
TALIESIN: Has anyone tried?

1386
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.890
LAURA: Maybe if we electrocute him, he's machinery.

1387
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.310
We could electrocute him, we could use water.

1388
00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:51.200
Maybe water will break him, if he's a machine?

1389
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.043
SAM: I'll shoot an electric water arrow at him.

1390
00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:57.753
Shit.

1391
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.090
TALIESIN: Try something. Don't assume anything,

1392
00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.070
just try something.
SAM: Okay, I will--

1393
00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:05.210
I mean, he's not looking at me,

1394
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:08.134
but that doesn't mean I'm hidden, right?

1395
00:55:08.134 --> 00:55:10.920
This is not a sneak attack?
MATT: No, you're not hidden, no.

1396
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.800
SAM: Well, then I will bonus action hide?

1397
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.370
There's nowhere to hide.
MATT: There's nowhere to hide.

1398
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.410
LAURA: Just shoot him.

1399
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:23.303
Try shooting him.

1400
00:55:23.303 --> 00:55:24.780
SAM: It's not worth it.

1401
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.270
LAURA: Shoot him in the face.

1402
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:27.650
SAM: Yeah, yeah, maybe.

1403
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:29.630
LAURA: Yeah, shoot him in the face.

1404
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:33.220
SAM: In the face! All right, I'm going to rush back

1405
00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.920
to that thing, that tower thing.

1406
00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.753
MATT: Okay.

1407
00:55:36.753 --> 00:55:38.960
SAM: That's even farther away. How far can I shoot?

1408
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.250
MATT: Back here, you mean?
SAM: Yeah.

1409
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:41.990
And hide behind it.

1410
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:43.760
MATT: Hide behind it, okay.

1411
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.070
SAM: How far is my range?
MATT: You move behind it.

1412
00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.050
SAM: Okay, sure.

1413
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.320
MATT: What is the range on your hand crossbow?

1414
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.600
SAM: It's 120, but at disadvantage.

1415
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.433
MATT: Right.

1416
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:55.630
SAM: Okay, so I will bonus action hide,

1417
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:57.230
and then shoot at it.

1418
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:58.830
MATT: Roll a stealth check.
SAM: Okay.

1419
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:03.750
Not great, wait, do I get advantage on stealth,

1420
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.220
because I got my cloak?

1421
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.070
MATT: You would, yes.

1422
00:56:07.343 --> 00:56:08.830
SAM: Better, 24.

1423
00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:10.860
LAURA: Didn't even see a second dice in his hand,

1424
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.000
it was just like he pooped it out.

1425
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.890
MATT: 24, then it canceled out, there's no advantage

1426
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:16.980
because you had disadvantage,

1427
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.570
so it's just a single roll, remember?

1428
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:20.670
SAM: So I don't get sneak attack if it hits?

1429
00:56:22.318 --> 00:56:23.330
MATT: Yeah.

1430
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:26.023
SAM: Okay, great, shit.

1431
00:56:26.023 --> 00:56:27.550
MATT: It's the problem with the long range on it.

1432
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.290
LAURA: Oh, wait, but that was a stealth check.

1433
00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:31.136
MATT: Oh, that was a stealth check,

1434
00:56:31.136 --> 00:56:31.969
I thought it was the attack roll.

1435
00:56:31.969 --> 00:56:32.802
SAM: That was a stealth check.

1436
00:56:32.802 --> 00:56:34.470
MATT: Right, okay, that's fine, but for your attack roll,

1437
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:35.500
you do not have advantage or disadvantage--

1438
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.160
LAURA: Oh, your stealth check wasn't a disadvantage.

1439
00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.310
SAM: Got it, so then I shoot at a 16 to hit.

1440
00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.930
MATT: That does not hit.

1441
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.360
SAM: All that work for nothing. (laughs)

1442
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.090
MATT: You see the bolt release, and it

1443
00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:49.070
fights the gravity for a second and impacts the side

1444
00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:52.500
of its shoulder, and just reflects off.

1445
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.965
SAM: Well, I've got fucking nothing!

1446
00:56:55.965 --> 00:56:57.460
MATT: All right, that ends their turn, Caleb?

1447
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.900
You spend your time banging the necklace.

1448
00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.733
LIAM: Trying to smash it.

1449
00:56:59.733 --> 00:57:01.970
MATT: Trying to smash it. Fjord, you're up.

1450
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.170
TRAVIS: I don't know if it's magic; it's an invocation,

1451
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:05.660
so we'll just fucking try it.

1452
00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.970
I will use Mask of Many Faces to try

1453
00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:11.740
and make myself look like Halas?

1454
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.573
MATT: Okay.

1455
00:57:13.515 --> 00:57:17.220
Nothing happens.
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool.

1456
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:21.745
Well, it's just us, Caleb. Okay.

1457
00:57:23.038 --> 00:57:24.888
Should I try and chop the collar off?

1458
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.620
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, give it a shot.

1459
00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:32.012
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it, so I'll walk over there.

1460
00:57:32.012 --> 00:57:34.050
TRAVIS: Can I summon the sword?

1461
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.640
MATT: Yeah, have you unsummoned it since last you used it?

1462
00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.850
TRAVIS: No, I mean, I've just had it, yeah--

1463
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:40.570
MATT: So you probably had it, and it'd still have the glow

1464
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:42.570
around you, so it's still invoked.

1465
00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:44.780
TRAVIS: Is the glow still glowing?
MATT: Yeah, you haven't,

1466
00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.700
you haven't uninvoked it. Oh, actually,

1467
00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:47.920
you did sheathe it when you leaped up

1468
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.599
onto the gears. You would have to resummon it, yeah.

1469
00:57:50.599 --> 00:57:51.950
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1470
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:54.390
MATT: So you can summon the sword with a--

1471
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:58.090
LAURA: Can you summon the sword, though? Is that magic?

1472
00:57:58.090 --> 00:57:58.923
MATT: Oh.

1473
00:57:59.855 --> 00:58:00.988
LIAM: Yeah, that's what we're asking.

1474
00:58:00.988 --> 00:58:03.234
MATT: Nope.
TRAVIS: Cool.

1475
00:58:05.933 --> 00:58:08.230
(laughter)

1476
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:09.938
TALIESIN: Still got a whip.

1477
00:58:09.938 --> 00:58:11.318
LAURA: No, it's a magic whip.

1478
00:58:12.577 --> 00:58:13.818
MATT: Still a whip.

1479
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.820
TRAVIS: And I have a little dagger.

1480
00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:17.700
MATT: All righty--

1481
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.199
LAURA: Is there a lock on the collar?

1482
00:58:20.199 --> 00:58:21.640
MARISHA: That picky lock--

1483
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it goes in a keyhole, and locks it.

1484
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:26.240
SAM: Also I have it.
LAURA: Also it's magic.

1485
00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.000
MARISHA: Oh, fuck!

1486
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.540
MATT: Caduceus, your turn.

1487
00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.840
TRAVIS: I'll move, I'll move over there by Caleb.

1488
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.240
MATT: You move over to him and, yeah, shit.

1489
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.340
Then turn around and fisticuffs.

1490
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.010
TRAVIS: Well, actually, with my action, is there anything

1491
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:48.350
on the collar that looks like a hinge, a clasp, a--

1492
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:49.900
MATT: Well, I'll put it this way. Mask of Many Faces,

1493
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.540
trying to cast it is an action,

1494
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.430
so you don't have your action,

1495
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:54.100
but you can make an investigation check

1496
00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:55.801
to see if there's some sort of mechanism to it.

1497
00:58:55.801 --> 00:58:57.410
TRAVIS: Okay.

1498
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:59.070
And then 14.

1499
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.240
MATT: Yeah, there is an actual device there.

1500
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.690
It's not intended for a key, but there is a section

1501
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:05.770
where it locked onto his neck

1502
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:08.380
that probably could be disabled.

1503
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.570
TRAVIS: Okay.

1504
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:10.750
MATT: Caduceus, what are you doing?

1505
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:11.830
LAURA: While also beheading you.

1506
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:13.610
MATT: It's (deep humming).

1507
00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:17.680
Slowly heading its way in an awkward zigzag path

1508
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.710
over towards the--
TALIESIN: I'm going to try--

1509
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:20.570
I have nothing, except for

1510
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:25.305
I have one spell with 60 foot reach. I'm going to try it.

1511
00:59:25.305 --> 00:59:28.350
I'm going to try Command.
MATT: Okay.

1512
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:29.650
LIAM: Command.

1513
00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:30.700
MATT: Interesting.

1514
00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:33.750
LAURA: I like it, I like it.
MATT: Okay.

1515
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:35.880
MARISHA: He said interesting. That's good, these are good.

1516
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.900
TALIESIN: I'm going to say--
MATT: You move up to the edge,

1517
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.805
look towards it.
TALIESIN: Off.

1518
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:45.330
TRAVIS: What?
LIAM: I like it.

1519
00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:47.471
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1520
00:59:47.471 --> 00:59:48.850
LIAM: ♪ Clap on ♪

1521
00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:49.703
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom save.

1522
00:59:49.703 --> 00:59:51.167
LAURA: ♪ Clap off ♪

1523
00:59:51.167 --> 00:59:53.110
MATT: Does have advantage.

1524
00:59:55.168 --> 00:59:57.168
Wisdom save.

1525
01:00:00.176 --> 01:00:01.993
(humming slows)

1526
01:00:01.993 --> 01:00:05.869
(cheering)

1527
01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:10.480
MATT: You watch as the jets peter out, the color vanishes,

1528
01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.705
and it begins to plummet.

1529
01:00:13.705 --> 01:00:15.260
But it's strange. When you watch it plummet,

1530
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.450
it plummets at an outward arc,

1531
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.570
meaning the gravity seems to shift in the other direction,

1532
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.470
away from the tower, and it's being thrust that way.

1533
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:23.560
You see it fall.

1534
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:27.080
TALIESIN: We don't have a lot of time.

1535
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.080
LAURA: Did the door come back as soon as the...?

1536
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.680
MATT: The door emerged.
TALIESIN: We don't have a lot of time.

1537
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.120
MATT: Your sword summons. What are you guys doing?

1538
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.240
TALIESIN: We've got to go now.
SAM: How long does that spell last?

1539
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.850
TALIESIN: Not long.
MARISHA: Shout at us what you see.

1540
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.940
LAURA: Fuck balls, I have to use Polymorph again.

1541
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.740
TRAVIS: I cut off Caleb's head.
(laughter)

1542
01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.573
MATT: Fixed it!

1543
01:00:46.481 --> 01:00:48.680
MARISHA: We don't know why he turned.

1544
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.710
LAURA: I mean, that's the only option,

1545
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.326
is to use Polymorph again, yeah?

1546
01:00:51.326 --> 01:00:52.267
To get everybody across?
MARISHA: Well, maybe check out

1547
01:00:52.267 --> 01:00:53.442
and see what room we're in first?

1548
01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:55.090
LIAM: Is the door back, too?
MATT: Yes.

1549
01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:57.060
SAM: We're going in this place!

1550
01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:00.492
TRAVIS: Fair note, if you just jump, you'll keep going.

1551
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.580
SAM: Did he go down and out, or just out?

1552
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.520
MATT: You saw him at an angle, like this.

1553
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.290
SAM: You try it first, you try it first,

1554
01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.180
and then if you start going too far, Feather Fall,

1555
01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.620
and then Fjord will catch you with the whip.

1556
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.960
Go, go try to jump--

1557
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.300
SAM: You want me to jump into an abyss of doom?

1558
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.133
TALIESIN: We've got to go now.

1559
01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:20.211
LAURA: So we can see how far you can go, go, try--

1560
01:01:20.211 --> 01:01:21.712
SAM: As an experiment!?
LAURA: Nott!

1561
01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:25.080
SAM: (screams)
(laughter)

1562
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.710
SAM: All right, she's going to toss me over the edge.

1563
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:28.543
MATT: Okay.

1564
01:01:28.543 --> 01:01:31.212
LAURA: I try to toss Nott as far--

1565
01:01:31.212 --> 01:01:33.550
MATT: Okay, make a strength check.

1566
01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:34.740
LAURA: Get ready to catch him.

1567
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.940
MATT: So Nott, you come over to--

1568
01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.460
TRAVIS: I've got my Castlevania whip at the ready.

1569
01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.750
LAURA: Strength check, strength check, strength check.

1570
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:46.773
Nine.
MATT: Nine, okay.

1571
01:01:46.773 --> 01:01:47.606
Go ahead and make--

1572
01:01:47.606 --> 01:01:50.140
LAURA: Wait, Guide me-- wait, you didn't guide me.

1573
01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.310
SAM: Go on! Guide me.
(laughter)

1574
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:53.400
TALIESIN: I don't know what's happening.

1575
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.440
I just had a thing happen, and I'm okay--

1576
01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.578
MATT: You shot put Nott about 10 feet,

1577
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.450
and you begin to fall, gravity gets weird for a second.

1578
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.620
Your body gyrates, and you begin

1579
01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.120
to drift at an outward angle, but you're going low.

1580
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.160
SAM: Oh, God.

1581
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.430
MATT: As you are now plummeting faster.

1582
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:12.263
LAURA: Shit.

1583
01:02:12.263 --> 01:02:14.970
SAM: At like fall speed, or at slow speed?

1584
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:16.880
MATT: Right now, I'd say it's probably

1585
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.020
at a fall speed out this way.

1586
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.180
SAM: I will cast Feather Fall.

1587
01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:21.424
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

1588
01:02:21.424 --> 01:02:24.260
So you drift from your falling speed to about there,

1589
01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.880
but you are about 20 feet below.

1590
01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.549
TRAVIS: That's all (whipping sound).

1591
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:30.249
SAM: I'm going to hold out my cloak like a flying squirrel.

1592
01:02:30.249 --> 01:02:32.670
(laughter)

1593
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.940
MATT: Perfect.
TRAVIS: Crack the whip.

1594
01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.138
Right towards Nott.
MATT: Okay.

1595
01:02:36.138 --> 01:02:37.373
Go ahead and make an attack roll.

1596
01:02:37.373 --> 01:02:39.488
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: I'd say--

1597
01:02:39.488 --> 01:02:43.030
LAURA: Do not try to catch it if
it does like you did before.

1598
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:44.230
MATT: So I'm going to have, if you want to try,

1599
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:45.530
because you're not trying to avoid it,

1600
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:46.800
you're trying to grab at it.

1601
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.910
SAM: I guess I'm not trying to avoid this, no.

1602
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:50.637
MATT: Right.
TALIESIN: Good call.

1603
01:02:50.637 --> 01:02:52.725
MATT: So I'll actually give you advantage on the attack.

1604
01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:54.660
TRAVIS: Okay.

1605
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.580
20.

1606
01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.020
MATT: 20, yeah, I mean, without issue.

1607
01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.050
The whip wraps around, and you catch Nott.

1608
01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:01.950
(laughter)

1609
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:03.920
And pull her back onto it, so Nott,

1610
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.182
you get up onto the side here.

1611
01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:06.870
LIAM: Caught a big one.

1612
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.490
SAM: Your turn, Jester. Jump!

1613
01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:13.630
MATT: So that's your action.

1614
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.005
LAURA: Oh, right.

1615
01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:22.150
MATT: Beau-- Nott, technically, you were just thrown

1616
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:23.740
and grabbed, you still haven't taken an action yet

1617
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.573
on your turn.

1618
01:03:24.573 --> 01:03:26.030
SAM: I mean, I cast Feather Fall-- that's a reaction.

1619
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:27.710
MATT: It's a reaction.
SAM: That's a reaction.

1620
01:03:29.638 --> 01:03:31.680
What if I, I don't got nothing.

1621
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.090
Hey, Caleb, do you have a rope?

1622
01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:34.980
Fjord, do you have a rope?

1623
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.470
LAURA: Try to unlock the thing on Caleb.

1624
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:38.070
Try to unlock the thing on Caleb's neck.

1625
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.140
SAM: All right, what thing?

1626
01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.270
LAURA: But you can use it as an action.

1627
01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:43.961
SAM: Oh, okay, well, let me go inspect
this thing for a while.

1628
01:03:43.961 --> 01:03:44.794
How's it look?
LAURA: You have the key.

1629
01:03:44.794 --> 01:03:45.627
You have the key!

1630
01:03:45.627 --> 01:03:47.504
SAM: But I've never seen this thing before.

1631
01:03:47.504 --> 01:03:48.337
I have a key?

1632
01:03:48.337 --> 01:03:49.495
LAURA: You have an unlocking key.

1633
01:03:49.495 --> 01:03:51.628
SAM: That's not an unlocking key. That's a locking key.

1634
01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:53.050
LAURA: Oh.

1635
01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:54.390
MATT: So are you going over to, using your--

1636
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:56.450
SAM: I'll go look and see what's going on.

1637
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:57.980
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

1638
01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.862
LIAM: And we're still in initiative order at this point?

1639
01:03:59.862 --> 01:04:02.630
MATT: Correct.
SAM: 15, oh, 13.

1640
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:03.850
MATT: Okay, it's loose

1641
01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:05.820
because the creature's not acting this round,

1642
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.280
so you guys are going at what pace you want to.

1643
01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:10.550
What'd you roll, sorry?
SAM: 13.

1644
01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:11.500
MATT: 13?
SAM: Not great.

1645
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.610
MATT: I mean, you know it's a locking mechanism.

1646
01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:16.610
You're inspecting it, it's probably unlockable,

1647
01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:19.700
but it's a little obtuse as to how you--

1648
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.440
it would take you a little bit of time to try it.

1649
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.270
SAM: I'll start working on it.

1650
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:24.103
MATT: Okay.

1651
01:04:24.103 --> 01:04:25.970
TALIESIN: For my turn, I would have also started moving

1652
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:27.920
in the direction that the island's going to be moving to,

1653
01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.753
just to try and keep--

1654
01:04:28.753 --> 01:04:29.586
MATT: Okay, it's moving this way.

1655
01:04:29.586 --> 01:04:31.630
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. Well, then I'm fine then.

1656
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:33.280
MATT: All right, so what are the rest of you guys doing?

1657
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.110
There's now this large gulf between you

1658
01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:36.920
and the island, and the creature is plummeting

1659
01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.920
and falling out that way.
TRAVIS: Who's next?

1660
01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.630
SAM: Come on, just jump!

1661
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:43.540
LAURA: Just run and jump.
MARISHA: You had slow-- you had--

1662
01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.400
so okay, I'm going to go back--

1663
01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.080
LAURA: He doesn't have a whip crack anymore, that's true.

1664
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.260
I can polymorph. I can polymorph on the next turn,

1665
01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.390
and try to fly us all across.

1666
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.390
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, that's better,

1667
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.556
because I can't do the whipping,

1668
01:04:55.556 --> 01:04:56.880
and you're right.
LAURA: Yeah.

1669
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.170
MATT: Okay, so--

1670
01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:59.520
LAURA: Do you guys want to go through the door,

1671
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.410
and we'll just go through the door as soon as it's--?

1672
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:02.985
TALIESIN: I mean...

1673
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:07.030
LAURA: If he wakes back up, that door's going to go away.

1674
01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.050
SAM: Yeah, we got to go through the door.

1675
01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:10.093
TALIESIN: Better not-- well, okay.

1676
01:05:10.093 --> 01:05:12.041
TRAVIS: We should all go together.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

1677
01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.230
LIAM: Caleb grabs Nott's hand and
drags her through the door.

1678
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.097
SAM: Oh!
TALIESIN: Okay, never mind.

1679
01:05:16.097 --> 01:05:16.963
SAM: But what if--

1680
01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:19.504
We have Feather Fall and nobody-- okay, bye.

1681
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.137
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Shit.

1682
01:05:22.137 --> 01:05:23.220
MATT: Are you guys doing anything-- I mean,

1683
01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.540
you moved up.

1684
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.850
Just look over the edge, the three of you,

1685
01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:27.800
well, you've, you took your action

1686
01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.250
in pushing Nott off of the side. What are you two doing?

1687
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:34.310
MARISHA: I guess, so I've got to wait for, wait a little bit

1688
01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:37.001
of time before Fjord gets an action again,

1689
01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:37.976
to try this?
MATT: Probably, yeah.

1690
01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:39.200
TALIESIN: If I have anything, I'm going to cast Bless

1691
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.550
on the three of us because I got nothing better to do.

1692
01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:43.293
MATT: Okay, so Jester,

1693
01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:47.210
Beau, and Caduceus all have Bless?

1694
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.043
All right, so--

1695
01:05:48.043 --> 01:05:50.620
MARISHA: I guess I'll hold my action until anybody--

1696
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.220
MATT: Okay.

1697
01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.660
So top of the round now. Technically, I let you go

1698
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.880
since the golem was falling, so now it's the golem's turn.

1699
01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.020
LIAM: This is complicated.

1700
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.530
MATT: The Command ends.
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

1701
01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:03.813
MATT: The eye lights up, and the thruster (roars).

1702
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.940
It slows down its descent because of the pace

1703
01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:08.900
that it's plummeting, so it doesn't

1704
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:12.030
actually get its full speed back, so it stays put.

1705
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.820
But it's stabilized, and it's going to rotate its face--

1706
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.146
LAURA: It's not farther away than that?

1707
01:06:18.146 --> 01:06:20.540
MATT: No, because it plummeted the one round length

1708
01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.373
the last round.

1709
01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:26.580
Back toward the island, the doorway flickers out,

1710
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:30.030
shortly after Caleb and Nott vanish through it,

1711
01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:33.052
and you feel the blue light come upon you, Fjord.

1712
01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.640
LIAM: Sword's out, though, right?

1713
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.560
MATT: The sword is out, though the runes have dulled.

1714
01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.708
That brings us to Jester, Beau, and Nott.

1715
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.846
MARISHA: I guess we've got to fight
this thing a little bit now.

1716
01:06:48.846 --> 01:06:50.180
LAURA: Yeah, what's the-- oh, God.

1717
01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.770
MARISHA: I've got some awesome lightning gloves.

1718
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:53.220
If you want to be an owl again,

1719
01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:56.300
I could ride your back and shoot lightning--

1720
01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:59.290
LAURA: Like from behind him? I'd have to try to fly--

1721
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:01.220
MARISHA: Like an Ace fighter.

1722
01:07:02.812 --> 01:07:04.918
LIAM: Do a barrel roll.
MARISHA: Pew, pew, I don't know.

1723
01:07:04.918 --> 01:07:07.478
TRAVIS: Who has this big-ass healing potion?

1724
01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.230
LAURA: You, Fjord.

1725
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.900
TRAVIS: I do. Okay, can't drink it.

1726
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.270
LAURA: I'm going to transform into a giant eagle.

1727
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:18.510
MATT: Okay.

1728
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:21.047
LAURA: And I'm going to--
SAM: (owl sounds) I'm an eagle.

1729
01:07:21.047 --> 01:07:23.815
LAURA: I'm going to pick up-- (owl sound)

1730
01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:27.850
I'm going to pick up Caduceus, but I'm going to swoop

1731
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:31.840
and let Beau climb on the back of my neck.

1732
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.322
MATT: Okay, so Beau, your fists still charged.

1733
01:07:36.322 --> 01:07:38.800
MARISHA: Full Falkor style here.
MATT: Yep, up on the back.

1734
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.810
LAURA: How close do you have to be in order

1735
01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:41.400
to make that thing work, those things?

1736
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.670
MARISHA: 20 feet.
LAURA: Okay.

1737
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:46.990
Now, his cone is a 3D cone, right?

1738
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:49.740
MATT: Correct, it's not a flat cone.

1739
01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.560
Everything in this space right here--

1740
01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.048
TALIESIN: You can always turn on his turn.

1741
01:07:54.048 --> 01:07:55.206
LAURA: I know we can turn on his turn.

1742
01:07:55.206 --> 01:07:56.900
TALIESIN: We've got to be over...

1743
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.100
MATT: Yeah, we'll say for the purposes
of just keeping you aware

1744
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.240
of where it is, I'll leave that there,

1745
01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.950
because you can see the blue light emanating

1746
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:02.783
from the front.

1747
01:08:02.783 --> 01:08:06.120
LAURA: The only option is to go high and get above,

1748
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.650
and try to, if he cancels us out,

1749
01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:09.920
then we'll drop to the island.

1750
01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.400
TRAVIS: That's a 60 foot cone?
LAURA: Potentially.

1751
01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.233
MATT: 60 foot cone, yeah.

1752
01:08:12.233 --> 01:08:14.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're going to have
to go 60 feet straight up.

1753
01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:17.180
SAM: Well, it's a cone--
LAURA: Well, it's a cone,

1754
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.770
so 60 feet at its highest,

1755
01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:22.807
so it's probably--
TRAVIS: I mean, if he looks up.

1756
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:26.850
MATT: Well, regardless, what do you guys do?

1757
01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.250
LAURA: I'm going to fly.

1758
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.710
MARISHA: I like the idea of getting over the island.

1759
01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:32.466
It's cool.
MATT: 60 foot, all right.

1760
01:08:32.466 --> 01:08:33.650
Where are you going?

1761
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:37.860
LAURA: I'm going to go, zoom, and try to be high,

1762
01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.675
like around here, to where I'm above the cone,

1763
01:08:40.675 --> 01:08:43.520
and also above the island.
MATT: So you can to about--

1764
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.700
above the island, you mean?

1765
01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.020
LAURA: Yeah, above the cone, above the island.

1766
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.320
MATT: It gets a little tight. I'd say

1767
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.670
you don't feel comfortable getting closer than

1768
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.130
that to where the island is, for fear

1769
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:53.510
of where the blue energy is.

1770
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.140
You can see the faint drifting.

1771
01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.820
LAURA: Okay, is that close enough for Beau to do her shit?

1772
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.970
Are we within 20 feet of it?

1773
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.883
MATT: You're not sure.

1774
01:09:03.883 --> 01:09:06.060
LIAM: 20 feet is the square in the middle of that island,

1775
01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:06.893
for reference.
MATT: Yeah.

1776
01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:08.540
So you're probably a little further away.

1777
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.998
You're too far away.

1778
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.210
TRAVIS: Those measuring things are awesome, by the way.

1779
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.260
SAM: Chuck her?

1780
01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.330
LAURA: Onto his back, do you want to...?

1781
01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.790
She's on my back, so she'd have to jump and then land.

1782
01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:22.700
MATT: Plus, you already used your action

1783
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.560
to cast a spell, so you're out of actions on this one.

1784
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.740
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea, though.

1785
01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.580
LAURA: You could leap. You're in leapable territory.

1786
01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:31.580
MATT: Beau and Caduceus, you guys are within probably 30-ish

1787
01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.240
or so feet from the creature. What do you do?

1788
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.220
LAURA: At least I'm an eagle now.

1789
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.660
TALIESIN: I'm going to try Command one more time.

1790
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.493
MARISHA: This is awesome.
MATT: You're going to try Command

1791
01:09:36.493 --> 01:09:37.537
one more time?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1792
01:09:37.537 --> 01:09:39.280
MATT: Okay.

1793
01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.680
MARISHA: I love jumping off things, so I'm going to--

1794
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.522
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going first, anyway.

1795
01:09:43.522 --> 01:09:45.823
MARISHA: Oh, wait, it's you, sorry.
MATT: It's up to you guys.

1796
01:09:45.823 --> 01:09:47.010
LAURA: Yeah, try it, because he might be able to--

1797
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:48.560
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter if I do this, then.

1798
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.480
It's no good.
LIAM: Hoo boy.

1799
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.030
MATT: You are fucking lucky.

1800
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:58.150
As it turns around, rights itself.

1801
01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:58.983
TALIESIN: Off.

1802
01:09:58.983 --> 01:10:02.751
(laughter)

1803
01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:04.500
MATT: You see it then drift further out

1804
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.620
and power it off a second time.

1805
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.603
TRAVIS: The flat delivery is everything.

1806
01:10:08.603 --> 01:10:10.376
"Off."
(laughter)

1807
01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:13.740
MATT: It is way over there now. This vanishes.

1808
01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.410
MARISHA: All right.

1809
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:17.730
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: Cool, cool, tight, tight.

1810
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:19.920
MATT: The doorway reappears.

1811
01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.410
LAURA: So we can fly in and go through the door?

1812
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:22.243
MATT: Yeah.

1813
01:10:22.243 --> 01:10:23.725
LAURA: Will I fit through as an eagle?

1814
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.110
MATT: Could be a tight squeeze,

1815
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:28.970
but you can if you want to.

1816
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:32.240
So you guys all enter--
SAM: The door?

1817
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.730
We made it out?

1818
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:34.563
LAURA: We made it.

1819
01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.710
SAM: Because of two Command spells?! Amazing.

1820
01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:39.510
LAURA: But the golem will be there when we come back?

1821
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:40.670
Or he could come through the door.

1822
01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.560
MARISHA: Or he <i>will</i> come through the door.

1823
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.010
LAURA: Well, I mean, it's a little door,

1824
01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:45.640
and I barely fit through as an eagle,

1825
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.140
and he's way bigger than that.

1826
01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:50.140
TRAVIS: We got to destroy the doorway.

1827
01:10:51.388 --> 01:10:53.760
SAM: We'll put a tripwire next to it so he'll fall.

1828
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.610
TRAVIS: There's no other door yet out of here.

1829
01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:00.043
SAM: That's where we are.
LIAM: We're making it, we're cool.

1830
01:11:00.043 --> 01:11:01.309
LAURA: We could be in the Golem Workshop,

1831
01:11:01.309 --> 01:11:02.975
Oh jesus, We could be in the Golem Workshop.

1832
01:11:02.975 --> 01:11:04.330
Out of the frying pan and into the fire?

1833
01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:06.836
TRAVIS: We'll find out, we'll find out.

1834
01:11:06.836 --> 01:11:09.386
TALIESIN: I'm out of 1st-level spells, too.

1835
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.690
TRAVIS: Well used.

1836
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:16.381
I mean, seriously, we would have been fjucked.

1837
01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:18.931
LIAM: Caduceus saves the day.
LAURA: Yeah, Caduceus seriously saves the day.

1838
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:21.722
TALIESIN: Ah!

1839
01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:26.916
MATT: Get to the room you guys are in here.
LAURA: I got all my 1st-levels.

1840
01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:29.090
I used up a whole bunch of spells.

1841
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:31.082
TALIESIN: It's 14-year-old VCR repair,

1842
01:11:31.082 --> 01:11:32.303
just turn it off and turn it on.

1843
01:11:32.303 --> 01:11:34.770
MATT: You guys rush through, one after another,

1844
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:38.480
stepping through what behind you is this double set

1845
01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.090
of heavy metal doors, as you step into a chamber,

1846
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.270
you can see ahead of you

1847
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:47.310
a cavernous hallway of carved granite,

1848
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:51.830
standing 40 feet high, and about 40 feet or so

1849
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:55.270
from side to side, and it carries back a depth

1850
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:56.570
of maybe 100 or more feet.

1851
01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.080
You can see tall pillars, three pairs of them

1852
01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.280
that are off to the sides,

1853
01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.930
helping support the weight of this chamber,

1854
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:06.890
each with ever-glowing torch sconces facing inward,

1855
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:10.480
giving a gentle flicker of firelight.

1856
01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.620
The room itself seems strangely empty,

1857
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.060
like it's been largely cleared out,

1858
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.825
or was never fully realized for its intended purpose.

1859
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.950
What do you guys want to do?

1860
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:23.160
SAM: What is the intended purpose?

1861
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.740
MARISHA: What's it look like?

1862
01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.170
LAURA: Is there anything in here that's sitting on the--

1863
01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:29.160
MATT: You can make a perception check.

1864
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.370
LIAM: Fjord, are you able to do that thing

1865
01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:31.950
where you see things that are invisible?

1866
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.370
Can you get this off of me, please?

1867
01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:34.730
SAM: Yes, I'll start picking the lock--

1868
01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:36.590
LAURA: Are you still mute? I mean, can you speak at all?

1869
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:38.050
SAM: Can you talk, or is it just magic?

1870
01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.180
MATT: No.

1871
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.210
LIAM: Oh, nothing?

1872
01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:41.810
LAURA: Okay, I'll start picking his--

1873
01:12:42.675 --> 01:12:46.670
MATT: Make a dexterity check with your proficiency bonus.

1874
01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:49.081
SAM: 25.
MATT: 25 is what you needed.

1875
01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:51.170
(gasping)

1876
01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:53.000
MATT: You get your devices into it,

1877
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.840
you find where the clamping mechanism is,

1878
01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.450
and you manage to unhinge it. It opens up

1879
01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.292
and clanks to the ground.

1880
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:03.080
LIAM: I pick it up and put it in my bag.

1881
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.720
MATT: Okay.

1882
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.670
TRAVIS: Can I cast See Invisibility with the Star Razor?

1883
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:09.503
MATT: Sure.

1884
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:13.777
Your vision spreads out in front of you,

1885
01:13:15.097 --> 01:13:16.000
and as you glance in, as well,

1886
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.050
there's that little bit of firelight around.

1887
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:21.110
You can see now these faint runes around the door

1888
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.470
that represent the enchantments

1889
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:24.210
that connect all these different doorways

1890
01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:25.140
from place to place.

1891
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.400
TRAVIS: The doorway that we came through?

1892
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.560
MATT: You came through, yeah.

1893
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.520
Looking over, you can see the faint glow

1894
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.800
of the enchantment that holds it there

1895
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.800
that anchors them together.

1896
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:35.660
Beyond that, nothing else catches

1897
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.350
your attention immediately. Glancing across the way,

1898
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:41.890
along the long length of road,

1899
01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:45.710
it looks like there's crates and tables,

1900
01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:48.080
boxes, things on the far, far end,

1901
01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.760
piled and shoved on the opposite end.

1902
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.670
TRAVIS: Can I call out that there
are runes above the doorway,

1903
01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:55.310
and I'm going to quickly start running the length

1904
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:58.320
of this room, looking for any similar runes

1905
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.880
on the wall, or any sort of additional doorway

1906
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.260
that maybe we don't see right away.

1907
01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.010
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

1908
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:06.018
MARISHA: Oh, there he goes.

1909
01:14:06.018 --> 01:14:08.138
LAURA: Traps, check for traps?

1910
01:14:08.138 --> 01:14:09.850
SAM: ♪ Traps! Ahhhh! ♪

1911
01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:11.470
TRAVIS: 20.

1912
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:12.895
MATT: Okay.

1913
01:14:13.822 --> 01:14:16.620
As you're running down the hallway,

1914
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:21.010
yeah, it looks like there's storage boxes

1915
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:22.420
and crates and things on the far end,

1916
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.410
some that are tipped over, the top left off.

1917
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:26.770
You can see a few large objects

1918
01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:28.120
that have tarps pushed over them,

1919
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:32.360
or big sheets that are just draped over the objects.

1920
01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.895
As you're charging down the third length,

1921
01:14:33.895 --> 01:14:34.830
you look, and you can see

1922
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.020
on the ground little bits

1923
01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.819
of ash or dust scattered in places.

1924
01:14:39.819 --> 01:14:43.440
SAM: This is the golem workshop.

1925
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.030
MATT: What'd you roll again?
TRAVIS: 20.

1926
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:47.567
MATT: 20, yep, that's it.

1927
01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:49.160
SAM: What you see, Fjordy?

1928
01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.040
TRAVIS: I'm looking for more runes. There are runes

1929
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.570
above the doorway that we came in.

1930
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.240
There must be another way out of here.

1931
01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.720
SAM: Runes? Well, look for traps and shit.

1932
01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.910
TRAVIS: What?
LIAM: Why don't you look for traps and shit?

1933
01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.600
SAM: I was dealing with you! All right,

1934
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.170
I'll just look around for traps and shit.

1935
01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:04.650
MATT: Okay, so you guys all waiting for,

1936
01:15:04.650 --> 01:15:06.440
are you continuing to check down the rest

1937
01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.550
of the hallway, and you're checking for traps?

1938
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:08.383
What are you guys doing?

1939
01:15:08.383 --> 01:15:10.700
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to say that I halt

1940
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.390
when he says traps, because I hadn't thought about that.

1941
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.590
I freeze.
MATT: Okay.

1942
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:17.710
So you stop right at that end

1943
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:21.960
of the first third of the chamber, halting there.

1944
01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.793
Sure, go for it.

1945
01:15:22.793 --> 01:15:24.930
LAURA: I'm going to cast Guidance on you.

1946
01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:26.910
SAM: All right.
LAURA: So that you're good.

1947
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:29.340
SAM: You're not going to throw me into the abyss again?

1948
01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.173
LAURA: No, but you did really good.

1949
01:15:30.173 --> 01:15:32.198
You looked really amazing as you were flying.

1950
01:15:32.198 --> 01:15:33.960
SAM: Well, thank you.
LAURA: Did it feel cool?

1951
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.216
SAM: It did not.

1952
01:15:35.216 --> 01:15:37.410
MATT: There's four sconces facing the inside of the pillars.

1953
01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:40.080
It's low light, but it's there.

1954
01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.430
SAM: I mean, it's a gigantic room.

1955
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:45.110
I guess I'll just pick the center path

1956
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.460
to scan for traps first.

1957
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.450
MATT: Are you doing it carefully, or?

1958
01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:51.025
SAM: Carefully.
MATT: Carefully, it'll take some time.

1959
01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.947
So go for it.

1960
01:15:53.947 --> 01:15:55.313
LAURA: We don't have time.

1961
01:15:55.313 --> 01:15:57.050
SAM: Then I won't do it carefully.

1962
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:58.460
I'll run to where Fjord was,

1963
01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.870
because he didn't trigger any traps,

1964
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:04.450
and I will continue from there.

1965
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:05.880
I'll pick left and just go left

1966
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.860
and start looking around.

1967
01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:08.266
MATT: Make a check with disadvantage.

1968
01:16:08.266 --> 01:16:10.330
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: But add four.

1969
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:13.330
MARISHA: I'm going to turn around and
keep an eye on the door.

1970
01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:15.030
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Good rolls.

1971
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.870
LIAM: Also, Caleb extends his hand, and what

1972
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:22.520
typically looks like a Fire Bolt forming there forms,

1973
01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.610
but just stays, and then licks up along his hand,

1974
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:29.210
and up to the forearm, and lights 10 feet out

1975
01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:30.200
in every direction.

1976
01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.360
TRAVIS: What happened to those manacles, by the way?

1977
01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.470
Just in case, didn't we have manacles

1978
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:36.013
that we could put on something?

1979
01:16:36.013 --> 01:16:38.090
LAURA: Aren't they in the bag?

1980
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:40.000
SAM: 26 for investigation.

1981
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.570
MATT: 26, yeah, the center part of the hallway,

1982
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:45.610
the floor is a smooth granite.

1983
01:16:45.610 --> 01:16:47.420
There's a faint crack

1984
01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.850
that runs along the length of it,

1985
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:51.257
across from one side to the other.

1986
01:16:51.257 --> 01:16:56.248
And there's a very, very, very faint, almost imperceivable

1987
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.610
change in texture to the stone.

1988
01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:03.960
SAM: Over the whole length of the--?

1989
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.950
MATT: Over the whole length, for about 15 feet or so,

1990
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:08.065
in the center of the hallway, and you also look,

1991
01:17:08.065 --> 01:17:10.910
on that piece, what you had saw was a couple bits

1992
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:13.520
of scattered ash, are actually three distinct piles of ash.

1993
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.450
LIAM: Yeah, those were people.

1994
01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:17.660
SAM: I will point that area out to the rest of the group.

1995
01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:19.190
TALIESIN: Okay, moving around it.

1996
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.320
LAURA: We can't move around it.

1997
01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.610
It's across the whole room.

1998
01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.570
MATT: It's a 15 foot distance, the entire length

1999
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:25.870
of the center of the floor.

2000
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:30.870
LAURA: Can we check for-- is that magic?

2001
01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.550
Do you think it's magic?

2002
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:35.170
SAM: Something there is something, I'll look up

2003
01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:38.570
to the ceiling to see if there's any holes

2004
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:40.450
or trigger points or glowing--

2005
01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:43.550
MATT: Make a perception check.
SAM: Okay.

2006
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:45.850
Natural 20.

2007
01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:47.458
(cheering)

2008
01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:49.630
MATT: Okay, you glance up at the ceiling.

2009
01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:51.650
You don't see any holes or anything

2010
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:55.530
that seems to be affixed, or connecting to this.

2011
01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.580
You do notice the pillars immediately

2012
01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.960
to the right and left of you guys, and just the side

2013
01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.630
that's facing the direction you're facing,

2014
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:08.404
it looks like there are darkened pits

2015
01:18:08.404 --> 01:18:11.497
and charred impacts,

2016
01:18:11.497 --> 01:18:14.370
like something has repeatedly blasted just this side

2017
01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:18.070
of the pillars behind you, facing the direction you are.

2018
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:20.210
LAURA: So it's coming from the other side?

2019
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:22.300
MATT: As if something were to come towards you

2020
01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.870
from the far end of the wall, and be blasting things--

2021
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:28.113
LIAM: Walking into a fire hose of fire
or something like that.

2022
01:18:28.113 --> 01:18:29.384
LAURA: Oh, great.

2023
01:18:29.384 --> 01:18:31.717
SAM: All right, all right.

2024
01:18:31.717 --> 01:18:35.433
The area that is bad news,

2025
01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:38.733
does it have--
MATT: I'll visually show you, this might be--

2026
01:18:38.733 --> 01:18:40.099
TRAVIS: Ah!

2027
01:18:40.099 --> 01:18:41.980
LIAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2028
01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.960
LAURA: I like how he waits until

2029
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.450
we start asking enough questions,

2030
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:46.723
and he doesn't just let us have it immediately.
TRAVIS: Go ahead, blueberry.

2031
01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:48.564
LIAM: I can't see it, Matt, I can't see it.

2032
01:18:48.564 --> 01:18:50.320
SAM: Do I still look ridiculous?

2033
01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.740
LAURA: You just look bruised.
LIAM: Do it, glam rock.

2034
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:54.320
SAM: This part of your nightmare is powered

2035
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.536
by Dwarven Forge.

2036
01:18:56.536 --> 01:18:58.036
LAURA: Whoa!

2037
01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.384
TALIESIN: This is a throwback to game one a little bit.

2038
01:19:01.384 --> 01:19:03.601
LAURA: Oh, man.

2039
01:19:03.601 --> 01:19:05.983
MATT: Let me set some of the lights here.

2040
01:19:05.983 --> 01:19:07.716
ALL: Ooh!

2041
01:19:07.716 --> 01:19:08.807
TRAVIS: Ambiance!

2042
01:19:08.807 --> 01:19:10.660
MATT: Because you can see it

2043
01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:13.230
with your super high perception roll, Nott.

2044
01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:15.690
You can see on the opposite end,

2045
01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:19.325
these large, plated--

2046
01:19:19.325 --> 01:19:20.520
SAM: Brutality.

2047
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.290
MATT: -- giant, weird ballista. You can just see the outline

2048
01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:24.680
of it, you don't see the design or the shape,

2049
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.040
but you can see this ballista-like structure.

2050
01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.300
You guys are right up on the edge here,

2051
01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.710
is where you--
LAURA: On the trigger point.

2052
01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:36.260
MATT: Seeing this area, this 15 foot band there is

2053
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.093
what you're worried about.

2054
01:19:37.093 --> 01:19:38.920
LAURA: Can we see anything that would make it,

2055
01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.400
that would trigger them, that is running

2056
01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.726
across the ground, or, like a mark on the wall or something?

2057
01:19:45.726 --> 01:19:48.030
TRAVIS: He has nothing, she has.

2058
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:50.270
SAM: Yeah, I mean, I didn't see a trigger.

2059
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:51.940
I just saw an area that was--

2060
01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:55.350
MATT: You saw the floor itself was discolored.

2061
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:57.980
It's a different, slightly different type of stone

2062
01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.000
than the rest of the floor.

2063
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.620
LIAM: Just don't hit the ground. Could we get some cover,

2064
01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.840
and Nott, you do your little trick with your hand,

2065
01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.120
and make something float--
MATT: Beau, you're keeping an eye here?

2066
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:05.953
MARISHA: I'm looking behind, yeah.

2067
01:20:05.953 --> 01:20:08.980
LIAM: -- in space to see if it's just the ground,

2068
01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.590
or if we could maybe get over.

2069
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:11.790
LAURA: We could hide behind the pillars

2070
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:14.890
and then toss something up and over.

2071
01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:16.540
TRAVIS: I will take cover behind one

2072
01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.040
of those little pillars.
LAURA: Yeah, same, same.

2073
01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.420
TRAVIS: While we figure this out.

2074
01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.020
SAM: That's a great idea, let's all do that.

2075
01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.500
LAURA: Let's all hide behind the pillars.

2076
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.510
MATT: You all hide behind the pillars?

2077
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:25.343
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2078
01:20:25.343 --> 01:20:27.290
LIAM: I'm going to hide behind the back pillar.

2079
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.130
MATT: Over here?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

2080
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.963
MATT: Okay.

2081
01:20:28.963 --> 01:20:30.400
TALIESIN: That's where the monster's going to come from.

2082
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.740
SAM: I will also hide behind one of those.

2083
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:34.765
MATT: You do know that that is probably coming.

2084
01:20:34.765 --> 01:20:37.620
And you know the pace, the distance that it fell

2085
01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.380
and the pace in which you can fly,

2086
01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.300
that time is getting short.

2087
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:45.260
SAM: Okay, I'm going to just--
MARISHA: Wait a minute.

2088
01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.810
I'm going to go back and mirror Caleb.

2089
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:49.227
MATT: Okay, sure.

2090
01:20:51.987 --> 01:20:52.840
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

2091
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.580
SAM: I'm hiding behind the pillar next to Jester.

2092
01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.430
I'm going to cast Mage Hand.

2093
01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.660
LIAM: Caleb is really fucked up.

2094
01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:05.940
SAM: I'm going to take Mage Hand with
the bone charm I found off

2095
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.730
of these dead hunters in the woods or whatever,

2096
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.850
and float it out to the middle

2097
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:12.290
of the dead zone there.

2098
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:15.080
MATT: The hand drifts it out there, nothing.

2099
01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.660
SAM: Okay, I'm going to say: Watch yourself!

2100
01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.260
and then I'm going to drop it on the floor.

2101
01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:22.250
MATT: Okay. The moment it hits the ground,

2102
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:25.391
both of the sheet-covered ballista (explosion)

2103
01:21:25.391 --> 01:21:28.430
and fire what looks to be an extremely vibrant blast.

2104
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:30.150
One is blue and one is reddish.

2105
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:31.740
You see them both blast the ground

2106
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.610
where that small charm hit, there is a burst of flame

2107
01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:37.240
and a spark of electricity, and where it impacted,

2108
01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.200
there's a blast wave of force

2109
01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:42.500
that causes the wind to blow your hair back.

2110
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.500
And where it hit the ground, there's this scattered piece

2111
01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.673
of shattered bone charm, where it once was.

2112
01:21:48.673 --> 01:21:50.690
SAM: Do you think they have to reload? Maybe we can go.

2113
01:21:50.690 --> 01:21:52.820
MARISHA: Or do you think that we could use this

2114
01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:55.220
to trap the golem in here?

2115
01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.690
SAM: Forget the golem, what if we can go right now?

2116
01:21:57.690 --> 01:21:59.660
What if the things have to recharge or something?

2117
01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:00.880
MARISHA: Where are we going to go? We don't even know

2118
01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.290
where it is on the other side.

2119
01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:03.530
LIAM: Well, at the very least, we could all get

2120
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:05.630
to the other side of it, and then set them off

2121
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:07.770
when the thing comes in here. That's a help.

2122
01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:10.830
TRAVIS: We need to get to the other side.

2123
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:12.850
LIAM: I'm moving back, closer to the group.

2124
01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:13.683
MATT: Okay.

2125
01:22:13.683 --> 01:22:14.850
SAM: Throw something else in there, see if it'll--

2126
01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:16.780
LAURA: I'm going to take one of the crystals--

2127
01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.200
I had a pocket full of crystals from a thing--

2128
01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.850
and I'm going to throw it on the ground.

2129
01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:22.250
SAM: Not the shiny thing, oh, okay.

2130
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:24.780
LAURA: I'm going to throw it, it was a little one.

2131
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.240
I'm going to throw it on the ground real fast,

2132
01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.500
right after Nott, just to see how fast they shoot again.

2133
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.000
MATT: Okay, you throw them out there.

2134
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.580
Maybe four seconds afterward,

2135
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.750
they both fire again immediately.

2136
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's no reload.

2137
01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:40.133
I can jump to the other side with one other person.

2138
01:22:40.133 --> 01:22:41.280
Anyone want to come with?

2139
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.327
MATT: It's interesting, you watch as they're about to fire.

2140
01:22:43.327 --> 01:22:45.930
Even though the sheet is over them,

2141
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:48.370
right over the sheet, and in the front

2142
01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:50.940
of where the bow portion of the ballista is,

2143
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:53.690
you see runes light up before it fires.

2144
01:22:53.690 --> 01:22:55.850
This is not your standard ballista.

2145
01:22:55.850 --> 01:23:00.130
TRAVIS: That's bad, the golem can turn the runes off.

2146
01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:01.274
SAM: Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2147
01:23:01.274 --> 01:23:03.280
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2148
01:23:05.184 --> 01:23:07.825
SAM: Wait, wait.

2149
01:23:07.825 --> 01:23:09.990
Don't we have some rock that you can throw

2150
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:11.460
and dispel magic?

2151
01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.670
LIAM: Fjord wasted it on the thing outside.

2152
01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:17.720
SAM: Oh. Jesus, Fjord, why are you so
stupid all of the time?

2153
01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.334
TRAVIS: I don't know. It's a good question.

2154
01:23:19.334 --> 01:23:21.058
MARISHA: I'm going to walk over and
feel the edge of the door.

2155
01:23:21.058 --> 01:23:23.290
Do I feel any vibrations, any footsteps,

2156
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:26.162
anything heavy coming, like a guy, a golem?

2157
01:23:26.162 --> 01:23:28.510
MATT: The door is partially open,

2158
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:30.400
and there's the shimmering purple,

2159
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.390
so you could put your head out, if you want, to look.

2160
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:33.280
MARISHA: Yeah.

2161
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.950
MATT: Okay, so Beau moves over, and pokes her head through.

2162
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:37.200
MARISHA: Just checking.

2163
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:40.900
MATT: It's heading in your direction,

2164
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:44.460
and its head's coming upward, and you sense its gaze about

2165
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.130
to hit the doorway that you are partially halfway through.

2166
01:23:47.130 --> 01:23:49.785
LAURA: Dude, Matt, I'm still an eagle.

2167
01:23:50.963 --> 01:23:52.820
I'm still an eagle.
SAM: Dude Matt.

2168
01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:53.870
MATT: Oh, you didn't change your form.

2169
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:55.327
LAURA: I didn't, I came through as an eagle.

2170
01:23:55.327 --> 01:23:56.990
LIAM: Let's say you dropped it to throw the--

2171
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.280
LAURA: Well, no, but I wouldn't have thrown the thing

2172
01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.180
if I was an eagle.

2173
01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.840
LIAM: But you could say that you turned

2174
01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.630
into a tiefling again to do it,

2175
01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:06.760
if you had the thought to do it,

2176
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.950
unless you want to be an eagle still.

2177
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:08.940
LAURA: Well, I mean, if we're talking

2178
01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.980
about flying over the thing, I wouldn't have dropped

2179
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:14.313
my form just to test it out, you know what I'm saying?

2180
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:16.733
TRAVIS: What?

2181
01:24:16.733 --> 01:24:17.610
LAURA: I was an eagle when I came through the door.

2182
01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:19.420
MATT: That's true, that is my fault.

2183
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.961
SAM: Why is that your fault?
LAURA: That's not your fault.

2184
01:24:20.961 --> 01:24:23.286
I should have remembered that I was an eagle.
SAM: Laura's the worst.

2185
01:24:23.286 --> 01:24:25.019
(laughter)

2186
01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:27.070
MATT: She did squeeze through in eagle form.

2187
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.370
SAM: Undo! Dunamancy, dunamancy, dunamancy.

2188
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.994
MATT: So all of your conversation has been (squawking).

2189
01:24:36.994 --> 01:24:39.394
LAURA: Yeah, I've been just chattering,
nobody's understood me.

2190
01:24:40.502 --> 01:24:41.460
But I don't know if I'd've been able

2191
01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.520
to hide behind a pillar as a giant eagle.

2192
01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.900
MATT: No, well, that's fine.

2193
01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:48.310
There you are.
SAM and LIAM: (laughing)

2194
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:49.743
SAM: You just got roasted.

2195
01:24:51.385 --> 01:24:52.420
MATT: It didn't impact you.

2196
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.310
LAURA: It didn't?
MATT: No, it only blasted the front

2197
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:56.817
of the floor where it was.

2198
01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:00.970
LAURA: I could try to fly us over.

2199
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.260
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, that better have been for something.

2200
01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.220
MARISHA: Quickly pop my head back in.

2201
01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.570
MATT: Okay, as you pop your head back in,

2202
01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.020
as soon as you pull away, the very tip

2203
01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.940
of your nose pulls back as, and the doorway just goes dark.

2204
01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:15.773
TALIESIN: It's right outside.

2205
01:25:15.773 --> 01:25:17.070
MARISHA: He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

2206
01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:18.260
LAURA: I'm going to hold my claws out.

2207
01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:20.560
If anybody wants to come into my claws,

2208
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.410
I'm going, I'm going to fly.
LIAM: All right, I'll grab Jester's claw.

2209
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:25.843
LAURA: (squawking)

2210
01:25:25.843 --> 01:25:29.313
SAM: Caduceus, go.
TALIESIN: Why me? Oh, okay.

2211
01:25:29.313 --> 01:25:32.140
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Step of the Wind again.

2212
01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:34.850
I'm going to use a ki point, and start hauling ass.

2213
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:37.510
LAURA: I'm going to fly up and try
to get over the ballistas.

2214
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:39.612
MATT: With who, with Caleb and?

2215
01:25:39.612 --> 01:25:40.445
LAURA: Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Apparently me.

2216
01:25:40.445 --> 01:25:42.560
TRAVIS: I can take one person over there as well.

2217
01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:45.590
SAM: Wait, we need Beau.

2218
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:46.670
MARISHA: I'm handled.
TRAVIS: She's running around.

2219
01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:48.240
SAM: You can jump it?
MARISHA: Yeah.

2220
01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.781
MATT: So you drop them off there. You guys can land,

2221
01:25:51.781 --> 01:25:54.289
with your 60 foot distance, about there, and there.

2222
01:25:54.289 --> 01:25:55.440
TRAVIS: Where's Nott?
SAM: I'm with you.

2223
01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.667
MATT: Nott's with you, What are you doing?

2224
01:25:57.667 --> 01:26:01.730
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Thunder Step.
MATT: Thunder Step?

2225
01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:03.700
TALIESIN: Hell, let's do it.

2226
01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.995
MATT: Where do you want to land?

2227
01:26:04.995 --> 01:26:08.912
TRAVIS: Just on the fucking crates in the back.

2228
01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:12.260
MATT: You land on that space.

2229
01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.360
And you're moving? 45 feet?

2230
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:18.280
MARISHA: Step of the wind. I'm going to haul ass.
MATT: (counting)

2231
01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.760
MARISHA: Yeah, can second--
MATT: You're going to attempt to--

2232
01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.170
MARISHA: And then I'm going to jump it.

2233
01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:23.270
My jump distance is doubled.

2234
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:25.150
MATT: You actually jump over the 15 feet.

2235
01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:29.580
TALIESIN: Cure wounds at second level.
MATT: And land off to the side there.

2236
01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.360
TALIESIN: Here, just take a little--
MATT: You still have an action.

2237
01:26:32.441 --> 01:26:35.390
MARISHA: I still have an action.

2238
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.640
Can I quickly do--
TALIESIN: 13 hit points.

2239
01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.191
SAM: To who?
TALIESIN: Just to Caleb.

2240
01:26:42.191 --> 01:26:43.830
SAM: Just to, just to, just to.

2241
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:45.260
TRAVIS: I mean, can anybody do some healing,

2242
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.680
or should I pound this thing now?

2243
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.990
TRAVIS: I mean, pound it, honestly. It's more useful

2244
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:51.670
for me to heal me once you're down, to be honest.

2245
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:53.450
TRAVIS: I'll drink this thing.
MATT: Okay.

2246
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:55.000
So you chug the potion.

2247
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.565
LIAM: I'm going to chug mine, as well.

2248
01:26:56.565 --> 01:26:58.965
MATT: Okay.

2249
01:26:58.965 --> 01:27:01.090
LAURA: I would help you, but I'm an eagle.

2250
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:03.130
LIAM: That's terrible.
TRAVIS: That's great.

2251
01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:04.460
MATT: You heal--?

2252
01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.920
LIAM: Well, Caduceus healed me 13, I think it was,

2253
01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.780
and six from the potion.

2254
01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:10.030
MATT: Okay, hand me the potion.

2255
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:13.278
LIAM: Yes, sir. Oh, let me put your potion back in.

2256
01:27:15.161 --> 01:27:16.910
Here you are.

2257
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:18.990
TRAVIS: It's just what you rolled, right?

2258
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.823
MATT: Yeah.

2259
01:27:19.823 --> 01:27:21.850
TRAVIS: So it's 28 points of healing.

2260
01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:23.540
SAM: Oh, I think it's 4d4 plus four.

2261
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:28.040
MATT: Plus four, and then with you, it's plus 16--

2262
01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.630
TALIESIN: I'm going to whisper in your ear.

2263
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:35.360
MATT: Okay, it's 4d4 plus four, 8d8 plus eight.

2264
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.300
TRAVIS: So plus eight, so

2265
01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.260
34, okay, great.

2266
01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:42.450
MARISHA: As an action, can I do a quick investigation check

2267
01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:43.740
to see if there's any writing,

2268
01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.137
or anything that I can quickly discern

2269
01:27:46.137 --> 01:27:48.220
that might be in these crates where I'm--

2270
01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.670
LIAM: I'm going to look for loot in these crates.

2271
01:27:50.670 --> 01:27:51.710
SAM: Loot?

2272
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:53.203
MATT: You guys are looting the room, okay.

2273
01:27:53.203 --> 01:27:55.076
LAURA: No, we need to look for an exit.

2274
01:27:55.076 --> 01:27:57.780
MARISHA: I just wanted to look for writing on the crates.

2275
01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:58.790
TRAVIS: I still See invisibility.

2276
01:27:58.790 --> 01:28:01.033
Is there any runes, or?
MATT: Make a perception check.

2277
01:28:01.033 --> 01:28:02.590
MARISHA: Can't I roll an investigation, man?

2278
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:05.880
MATT: You're not close enough. This is just a quick glance.

2279
01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.963
LIAM: Cocked.

2280
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:10.410
TALIESIN: Is there any weird wall, also?

2281
01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:12.360
MARISHA: No, natural one.
MATT: No, you don't see anything.

2282
01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.307
What was that?

2283
01:28:14.307 --> 01:28:15.790
You and Caleb both still have your movement

2284
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:16.940
and your action, by the way.

2285
01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.890
TRAVIS: Can I use my See Invisibility,

2286
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:21.784
also, to see if there's any runish stuff around?

2287
01:28:21.784 --> 01:28:23.709
MATT: I mean, seeing invisibility doesn't mean

2288
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:24.542
you see everything arcane.

2289
01:28:24.542 --> 01:28:26.190
Whatever the runes were around the doorway

2290
01:28:26.190 --> 01:28:28.930
were there, you don't see anything like that, unfortunately.

2291
01:28:28.930 --> 01:28:30.550
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.
MATT: Yes, Detect Magic?

2292
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:33.250
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: Yeah, the two ballista

2293
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:36.470
to the left and right of you, super magical,

2294
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:37.490
and you sense a couple

2295
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:41.000
of small magical sources somewhere in the pile.

2296
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.010
TALIESIN: I'm going to go for those sources real quick,

2297
01:28:44.010 --> 01:28:45.080
just to see what the fuck they are.

2298
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:45.913
MATT: Okay.

2299
01:28:45.913 --> 01:28:49.110
LIAM: I'm using my action to rage loot

2300
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:50.410
for anything that could help.

2301
01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:52.180
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

2302
01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.013
SAM: I would like to rage loot.

2303
01:28:53.013 --> 01:28:55.270
MATT: Not you, you used your action casting the spell,

2304
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:57.110
so you just now get up to it.

2305
01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:00.080
TALIESIN: I'm also going to get in a corner,

2306
01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.640
if possible, if it's possible just to hide a little bit

2307
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.440
from what the hell's coming, or no, nah, nevermind.

2308
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.830
MATT: You're either moving to hide, or you're checking--

2309
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:06.910
TALIESIN: No, I'm checking.

2310
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:08.934
LIAM: 25.

2311
01:29:08.934 --> 01:29:10.290
MATT: Okay, you start rummaging through,

2312
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:11.980
and you see these broken boxes,

2313
01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.910
looks like this place has been rolled already somewhat,

2314
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:16.330
like a lot of things have been cracked open.

2315
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:19.125
There's elements, looking around.

2316
01:29:20.650 --> 01:29:24.530
Okay, you do find a pearl box

2317
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:27.585
that's flat and square, about that big,

2318
01:29:27.585 --> 01:29:29.610
and across the way, you can see

2319
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.232
a long bronze box that's about that long,

2320
01:29:33.232 --> 01:29:34.820
it looks like a table leg made of bronze,

2321
01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.011
but that's a little bit away from you to get to.

2322
01:29:37.011 --> 01:29:38.412
That's all you got.
LIAM: A pearl box and long box.

2323
01:29:38.412 --> 01:29:41.600
MATT: Pearl box and the long bronze box.

2324
01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.347
And you're looking around.

2325
01:29:44.347 --> 01:29:45.690
You just finished dropping them off,

2326
01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:46.670
Beau just got over there and made a look,

2327
01:29:46.670 --> 01:29:48.340
I think that's everybody. Nott?

2328
01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.500
SAM: I'm going to look along this wall

2329
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.220
for any false doors, or hidden somethings.

2330
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.053
MATT: Perception check.

2331
01:29:54.053 --> 01:29:55.220
SAM: Perception.

2332
01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.520
LIAM: Does finding the pearl box include
holding the pearl box?

2333
01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.220
SAM: Perception five.

2334
01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:02.790
MATT: Looking around in the vicinity--

2335
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:05.050
If you want to take your time to slowly feel,

2336
01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:07.300
it'll take you a few rounds to try and check for--

2337
01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:12.210
because this is the middle of a timed scenario.

2338
01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:15.610
LIAM: Did finding the pearl box include
holding the pearl box?

2339
01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:17.440
MATT: No, just finding it. You see it there.

2340
01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.620
The purple doorway returns on the opposite side.

2341
01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:25.200
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

2342
01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:29.090
MATT: Steps through on that end. Everyone roll initiative.

2343
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:33.130
TRAVIS: Send everything.
TALIESIN: Hey!

2344
01:30:33.130 --> 01:30:35.547
MARISHA: Burned my maelstrom gloves.

2345
01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:39.810
Can't do that again now.

2346
01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:41.460
Unless a minute, has it been a minute?

2347
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.430
MATT: The maelstrom gloves themselves, the effect is faded,

2348
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:46.530
but there is still crackling purple energy

2349
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:49.650
from when you took the power into your gloves

2350
01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:52.010
that has not been expended yet.

2351
01:30:52.010 --> 01:30:54.040
MARISHA: Oh, because I didn't use it.

2352
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.030
MATT: And you're not quite even sure what it does.

2353
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:58.560
But you still have the thrum

2354
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.040
of that purple energy that you absorbed

2355
01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.990
from the outside of the tower.

2356
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:05.440
So, 25 to 20?

2357
01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.880
LAURA: 23, I don't want to--

2358
01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.100
SAM: Does spirit gum ever come off?

2359
01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:10.933
MARISHA: No.

2360
01:31:10.933 --> 01:31:12.380
TRAVIS: You only have five minutes to remove it

2361
01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.630
before it becomes permanent.

2362
01:31:13.630 --> 01:31:15.090
MATT: 20 to 15?
LIAM: 19.

2363
01:31:15.090 --> 01:31:18.160
TALIESIN: 17.

2364
01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.360
SAM: 16 for Nott the Brave.

2365
01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:23.371
MATT: 16, you said?

2366
01:31:23.371 --> 01:31:24.420
TALIESIN: 17.

2367
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:27.270
MATT: 17, and Nott, you have what?

2368
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:28.740
SAM: 16.

2369
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:31.540
MATT: All right, 15 to 10?

2370
01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.373
MARISHA: 13.

2371
01:31:32.373 --> 01:31:35.380
MATT: 13, Beau.

2372
01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.213
10 to five?

2373
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:41.040
TRAVIS: Two.
MATT: And Fjord.

2374
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.690
Holding up the rear. All right, Jester, you're up first.

2375
01:31:43.690 --> 01:31:47.280
LAURA: Of course I fucking am!

2376
01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:51.440
What color is his face?

2377
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:56.420
MATT: Right now, green.
LIAM: Poison face.

2378
01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:00.240
LAURA: This is going to suck.

2379
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.840
MATT: In order to make the doorway work for itself,

2380
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.110
it had to shut down its anti-magic cone.

2381
01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:05.643
LAURA: Right.

2382
01:32:08.150 --> 01:32:12.990
Right, I'm going to fly up and over the area of doom.

2383
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:16.830
MATT: Okay, you have 60 feet of movement.

2384
01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:17.922
LAURA: Yep.

2385
01:32:17.922 --> 01:32:20.540
MATT: (counting)

2386
01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.080
That's as far as you can get there.

2387
01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.550
LAURA: I'm going to fly to--

2388
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:27.580
is this within 60 feet of him?

2389
01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:30.420
I won't be able to tell.

2390
01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.800
well, if I'm flying--

2391
01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.030
MATT: 60 feet from him is about there.

2392
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:35.210
LAURA: Okay, good, then I would fly about here.

2393
01:32:35.210 --> 01:32:36.526
MATT: Okay.

2394
01:32:37.446 --> 01:32:39.970
LAURA: I'm going to turn into Jester.

2395
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:43.630
I'm going to use my action--

2396
01:32:45.202 --> 01:32:47.103
LIAM: Look at that brave little blue tiefling.

2397
01:32:47.103 --> 01:32:48.790
LAURA: To cast Command.

2398
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:49.982
MARISHA: Hey!

2399
01:32:49.982 --> 01:32:52.073
MATT and TALIESIN: Okay.

2400
01:32:52.073 --> 01:32:53.650
LAURA: Having seen Caduceus's.

2401
01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:56.460
TALIESIN: Has it been a minute since we got into the room,

2402
01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.530
by the way, or no?

2403
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:59.440
No, because it's only just been a few--

2404
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.273
MATT: It's been a minute.

2405
01:33:00.273 --> 01:33:01.450
TALIESIN: Okay, it's been a full minute.

2406
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.440
MATT: It's been a few minutes, like basically,

2407
01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.740
when you guys send it shutting off again,

2408
01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.950
it got pulled really far away from the gravity,

2409
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:09.130
and it's been slowly working against that gravity

2410
01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:10.370
to find its way back to the portal,

2411
01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:11.790
since it was in the outside of the tower.

2412
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:13.957
SAM: I investigated stuff.

2413
01:33:16.296 --> 01:33:18.713
MATT: So-- It's cocked.

2414
01:33:18.713 --> 01:33:21.189
LAURA: I'm going to throw up.

2415
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:24.856
MATT: So even with advantage on it, it got a 14.

2416
01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:29.170
LAURA: Off?
(laughter)

2417
01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:31.792
MATT: You see (mechanical humming)

2418
01:33:31.792 --> 01:33:34.860
it goes to take a step, and then goes dark,

2419
01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.960
and then just holds itself in place there.

2420
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.370
SAM: What do we do now?

2421
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.910
LAURA: We've got a minute, yeah?

2422
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:42.480
TALIESIN: We've got six seconds.

2423
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.768
LAURA: Oh god. Find a doorway!
SAM: Six seconds?

2424
01:33:44.768 --> 01:33:47.220
MATT: It lasts for one round.

2425
01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:49.390
MARISHA: Caleb, you're on initiative.

2426
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.690
LIAM: Caleb goes like this to the two things he found,

2427
01:33:51.690 --> 01:33:55.400
goes towards the longer box, and rips it open.

2428
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.390
MATT: Okay, it's locked.
LIAM: Oh, it's locked?

2429
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:58.610
MATT: You go and grab the box and pull it out,

2430
01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:01.430
and it's a metal box that has a lock mechanism on it.

2431
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:04.820
LIAM: Shit, which is my action, probably, to pick it up.

2432
01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.120
MATT: I won't say it's an action to pick it up.

2433
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.040
Picking up an object is a free part of your turn.

2434
01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.320
You get to do that once, so you haven't used your action.

2435
01:34:11.294 --> 01:34:12.650
That's over there.

2436
01:34:12.650 --> 01:34:15.680
So you move about 15 feet. You're behind Fjord now,

2437
01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.158
over there.
LIAM: Okay.

2438
01:34:17.158 --> 01:34:19.391
(groans)

2439
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:25.470
Fuck it. I throw a Fireball down to the back end

2440
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:26.945
of the hallway.

2441
01:34:28.399 --> 01:34:30.206
I throw the box down to my feet.

2442
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:33.380
MATT: Explodes.
LAURA: We've got a whole round

2443
01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.810
of it not being able to do anything.

2444
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:35.890
MATT: Roll damage on that.

2445
01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:36.723
LAURA: Turned off.

2446
01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.290
LIAM: Oh, and I will do it at--

2447
01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:41.310
will you let me do it at a higher level?

2448
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:43.657
MATT: If you want to, sure. You may.

2449
01:34:43.657 --> 01:34:44.576
LIAM: Yeah.

2450
01:34:44.576 --> 01:34:46.812
I'm going to do it at 4th-level.

2451
01:34:46.812 --> 01:34:49.680
MATT: Fourth level, all right.
LIAM: That's five phalanges.

2452
01:34:54.563 --> 01:34:57.360
(counting) and then an extra,

2453
01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.020
okay, here we go. Okay.

2454
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:01.910
SAM: How will you know which ones you rolled?

2455
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:04.230
LIAM: 15-- I know. 21.

2456
01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:06.063
MATT: The d6s, man.

2457
01:35:06.063 --> 01:35:07.890
LIAM: 31.

2458
01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:12.230
MATT: The Fireball explodes with extreme anger and fury,

2459
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:15.180
as the arcane flames dissipate and the smoke vanishes,

2460
01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:18.260
you can see the golem, its metallic portions

2461
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:20.190
of its body, which is the majority of its parts,

2462
01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:24.463
are now heated bright orange. Takes no damage,

2463
01:35:24.463 --> 01:35:27.130
and what elements of it looked slightly scuffed--

2464
01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:30.330
LIAM: I healed it.
MATT: Have healed closed.

2465
01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:35.330
LIAM: This thing sucks!
(laughter)

2466
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:36.990
MATT: That's Caleb's turn. Caduceus?

2467
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:38.350
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2468
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.690
MARISHA: What was it, Archmage's Bane?
TRAVIS: That's a big bag of dicks, right there.

2469
01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:45.605
LIAM: That is awesome.
MATT: Archmage Bane.

2470
01:35:45.605 --> 01:35:47.318
SAM: Oh my god.

2471
01:35:49.525 --> 01:35:51.958
MATT: How many hit points is that, Matt?

2472
01:35:51.958 --> 01:35:53.530
Just tell us, because it's fucking shit.

2473
01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:54.990
We're going to die in a cargo space.

2474
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:56.870
MATT: But you do know, don't use fire now.

2475
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:57.895
LIAM: Yep.

2476
01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.310
MATT: What are you doing, Caduceus?

2477
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:04.030
TALIESIN: I'm going to try, shit, that didn't work.

2478
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:07.929
LAURA: I'm right in its range, too. I'm fucked as soon as

2479
01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:09.284
it turns back on.

2480
01:36:09.284 --> 01:36:11.370
SAM: Are you first in the order?

2481
01:36:11.370 --> 01:36:13.420
LAURA: Yeah, but it's going to, yeah.

2482
01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.500
SAM: Well, you might have one more move before--

2483
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.220
TALIESIN: And he's far, far, far away from me right now.

2484
01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.310
SAM: You went before.

2485
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:20.890
LAURA: That's true, I would have one more move.

2486
01:36:20.890 --> 01:36:22.220
That's a good point.

2487
01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.090
MATT: Yeah, and technically, just because

2488
01:36:24.090 --> 01:36:26.820
of how the spell is supposed to work, just so you're aware,

2489
01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:28.590
it hasn't shut off yet technically.

2490
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:30.820
It's starting to shut off. It doesn't take the action

2491
01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.270
until its turn, technically, so you do the Command,

2492
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:36.410
you know it worked, and you see it flickering,

2493
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:39.297
and when it takes its next turn, it's going to shut off,

2494
01:36:39.297 --> 01:36:40.600
just so you know that.

2495
01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.620
TALIESIN: I'm going to dig those things out of the pile

2496
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.780
that I see glowing, because--

2497
01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.790
MATT: One of them Caleb is holding, and it's--

2498
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:49.150
TALIESIN: Oh, it's just the two boxes?
MATT: Yeah.

2499
01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:51.050
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at the other box.

2500
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:52.330
Is it also locked?

2501
01:36:52.330 --> 01:36:53.620
MATT: You go over and pull it out and look,

2502
01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:54.840
yeah, it is also locked.

2503
01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.650
TALIESIN: Okay, then I'm going to--

2504
01:36:57.504 --> 01:36:58.480
MATT: It was right there in front of you

2505
01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.313
where you've been placed,

2506
01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:00.790
so you didn't lose any movement,

2507
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:02.810
you didn't use an action.

2508
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:05.300
TALIESIN: Okay, then I'm going to back off and--

2509
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:08.528
shit, I'm going to--

2510
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:14.990
I don't have anything that's far enough,

2511
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:16.660
that has a far enough range to hit it, do I?

2512
01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.260
MATT: You are quite a ways away from it,

2513
01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.380
probably well over 100 feet,

2514
01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.870
if not close to 100 feet or more.

2515
01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.160
TALIESIN: Okay.

2516
01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.660
LIAM: Also, if it hasn't occurred to anyone,

2517
01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:29.300
if stands on the pressure plate or whatever

2518
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.500
for the trap, then it is in a healing fire spot,

2519
01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.460
getting regenerated the entire time.

2520
01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:37.940
TALIESIN: But it'll have to turn off its anti magic.

2521
01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:42.590
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're 110 from.
LIAM: It will regenerate.

2522
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:45.540
MATT: You did notice that one of them,

2523
01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.803
at least when it fired, shot fire,

2524
01:37:47.803 --> 01:37:49.406
and the other one shot lightning.

2525
01:37:49.406 --> 01:37:52.050
LAURA: We need lightning. It'll hurt it

2526
01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:53.837
and heal it at the same time--

2527
01:37:53.837 --> 01:37:57.503
MATT: Yeah, shoot a lightning ball at it, Caleb.

2528
01:37:57.503 --> 01:37:59.270
TALIESIN: I'm looking at Beau,

2529
01:37:59.270 --> 01:38:04.020
and are you looking like you're-- well, hmm.

2530
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:05.750
MATT: What are you doing, Caduceus?

2531
01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:12.007
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm just going to hold my action

2532
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:13.560
as a heal--

2533
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.670
MATT: So you're holding what spell?

2534
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:15.660
TALIESIN: I'm holding a--

2535
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.493
TRAVIS: Don't let it waste,

2536
01:38:16.493 --> 01:38:17.800
whatever it is, heal is important.

2537
01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.758
TALIESIN: Oh, it's going to hit somebody.

2538
01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.610
But I'm holding a

2539
01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:29.460
Healing Word.

2540
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:32.160
MATT: Okay, I'll allow it.

2541
01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.550
TALIESIN: I'm holding a Healing Word.

2542
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:35.040
MATT: Usually it's a bonus action, but I'll allow it.

2543
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.490
TALIESIN: I'm backing to the corner. I'm just going to see

2544
01:38:36.490 --> 01:38:37.620
who needs it most.
MATT: You've got it.

2545
01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:39.730
Okay, that finishes Caduceus's go. Nott, you're up.

2546
01:38:41.086 --> 01:38:43.060
LIAM: I am ill-equipped.

2547
01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.170
TALIESIN: Aren't we all?
SAM: It's so far away.

2548
01:38:44.170 --> 01:38:46.470
MATT: It's just this open hallway, darkly lit

2549
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:49.220
by the torches, and the golem on the other side

2550
01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:50.812
that just slammed through, you see its face

2551
01:38:50.812 --> 01:38:53.150
sputtering with energy

2552
01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:58.740
after Jester's extremely confident Command.

2553
01:38:59.962 --> 01:39:01.212
What are you doing?

2554
01:39:02.988 --> 01:39:04.500
LAURA: How are we going to get out of this?

2555
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.240
We're going to die!

2556
01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.550
MATT: There is no discernible door you've found,

2557
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:10.712
if there is one.

2558
01:39:10.712 --> 01:39:12.199
SAM: I think we have to find doors.

2559
01:39:12.199 --> 01:39:13.510
MATT: Look at the map.

2560
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:18.220
SAM: I'm going to spend my whole turn looking for doors.

2561
01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:21.040
LAURA: A secret door.

2562
01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.610
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

2563
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:25.660
MARISHA: You pick an area, and then I will do another area.

2564
01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:26.970
SAM: I'll go over here.
MARISHA: All right.

2565
01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:29.250
TALIESIN: I don't think we're going to find a door, man.

2566
01:39:29.250 --> 01:39:31.480
SAM: A doorman?

2567
01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.860
18.

2568
01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:34.770
MATT: You go through that side and you're looking

2569
01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:37.140
around the side, it is solid. There is nothing in there,

2570
01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:38.710
you're looking for cracks or anything.

2571
01:39:38.710 --> 01:39:40.330
There is no discernible door.

2572
01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:43.140
LAURA: What? What is the answer here?

2573
01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:46.140
What do we do?
SAM: Bonus action hide.

2574
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.110
MATT: There are very few chambers in that map

2575
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:51.099
that don't have a secondary connection.

2576
01:39:51.099 --> 01:39:55.020
TRAVIS: Right.
LAURA: Yeah.

2577
01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:56.400
MARISHA: So wait, are we in the armory?

2578
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.870
MATT: You're in the arcane armory.

2579
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:59.750
MARISHA: It is a square thing, nothing

2580
01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:01.190
about this tower is circular.

2581
01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:02.450
SAM: We have to go out the way we came in.

2582
01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:07.300
MARISHA: Son of a bitch, unless there's
a door he hasn't found.

2583
01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:08.133
SAM: That's true.

2584
01:40:08.133 --> 01:40:09.110
TRAVIS: He said there are very few rooms

2585
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:11.360
that don't have a second entrance.

2586
01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.440
So there might be, or maybe this is one of the--

2587
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.120
MATT: I'm saying this might be one of the very few.

2588
01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.710
Looking at the map, it's one of the few in the map

2589
01:40:17.710 --> 01:40:19.150
that does not have a secondary exit.

2590
01:40:19.150 --> 01:40:19.983
MARISHA: But didn't he also say

2591
01:40:19.983 --> 01:40:22.260
he was still uncovering hundreds of doors?

2592
01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:23.870
MATT: It's possible, it's possible.

2593
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:24.720
I'm just saying, whatever it is,

2594
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.630
Caduceus finished his turn, and Nott, what are you doing?

2595
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:28.480
SAM: Bonus action hide.

2596
01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.400
MATT: Bonus action hide, all right.

2597
01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.520
There aren't enough boxes to hide in,

2598
01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.880
so you move back into the crates,

2599
01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:36.600
and make a stealth check.
SAM: The crates.

2600
01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.833
Natural one, oh.

2601
01:40:37.833 --> 01:40:39.578
MATT: Well, you have advantage because of your cloak.

2602
01:40:39.578 --> 01:40:43.120
SAM: Oh, yeah, that's good, 21.

2603
01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.230
MATT: 21, you got it, Beauregard, you're up.

2604
01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:48.480
MARISHA: Is the box a door, Nott? Is the box a door?

2605
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.740
SAM: No, there's no doors over here.

2606
01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:54.740
MARISHA: Fuck, okay, I am going to turn around.

2607
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:55.583
MATT: Okay.

2608
01:40:57.208 --> 01:40:58.612
MARISHA: Step of the Wind again.

2609
01:40:58.612 --> 01:41:02.470
MATT: All right, (counting)

2610
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:05.260
that's your general movement to get yourself there.

2611
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.430
LIAM: Does she trigger using Step of the Wind?

2612
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:08.580
MARISHA: I jumped.

2613
01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:09.413
I jumped acoss.
MATT: Right.

2614
01:41:09.413 --> 01:41:10.770
I assumed step of the wind, she leapt.

2615
01:41:10.770 --> 01:41:15.563
MARISHA: I cannot double jump. 45, right, right, right?

2616
01:41:15.563 --> 01:41:17.530
Dash, dash.

2617
01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:20.630
MATT: That's your movement, and then bonus action to move,

2618
01:41:20.630 --> 01:41:22.410
so you can move all the way up to it if you want.

2619
01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:24.120
MARISHA: Yes, for Step of the Wind.
TALIESIN: Oh, good.

2620
01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.602
MATT: Go for it, okay.

2621
01:41:25.602 --> 01:41:30.370
MARISHA: I'm going to see whatever energy, okay, wait, okay.

2622
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:33.670
Do I see anything on him as he's powering off

2623
01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:37.002
that looks like an arc reactor,

2624
01:41:37.002 --> 01:41:41.580
or a battery, or a sparkling gem?

2625
01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:43.610
MATT: All parts of him are connected in some way,

2626
01:41:43.610 --> 01:41:45.220
shape, or form, have little bits of arcane energy

2627
01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.410
that surge through it, a lot of it's metal

2628
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:49.500
with a little bit of a stone covering over it.

2629
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.750
The face lights up, parts of the joints

2630
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:53.830
and where the metal seems to meet light up,

2631
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:55.460
and you can see on the inside,

2632
01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.510
there are maybe some sensitive places, yeah.

2633
01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.160
MARISHA: Sensitive places. Okay.

2634
01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.270
I am just going to--

2635
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:03.490
LAURA: The ray comes out of his face.

2636
01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:07.280
MARISHA: Once again, yeah, I'm going to wind up this power,

2637
01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.550
I'm going to do a big fatty uppercut to his jaw.

2638
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:13.582
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack.

2639
01:42:13.582 --> 01:42:14.600
LAURA: Oh god.

2640
01:42:15.605 --> 01:42:16.730
SAM: Cause some damage.

2641
01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.260
MARISHA: 18.

2642
01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.460
MATT: 18 misses.

2643
01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.007
You uppercut, and as your fist hits this front

2644
01:42:23.007 --> 01:42:26.592
of its chest, it just glides off of the armor,

2645
01:42:26.592 --> 01:42:28.300
the stone shell of itself too strong

2646
01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:30.300
for you to impact.
MARISHA: Wait, wait.

2647
01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.470
19 with the Maelstrom Gloves.

2648
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:33.690
MATT: The maelstrom gloves have worn off,

2649
01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:36.440
the effect is separate, whatever is on there currently.

2650
01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.752
Even with a 19, it glides off its armor, no impact.

2651
01:42:39.752 --> 01:42:41.010
LAURA: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: Jesus!

2652
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:42.590
MATT: You have your second attack still,

2653
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:43.700
because you're using your action.

2654
01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:46.250
LAURA: Try it again, Beau, try it again.

2655
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:48.982
MARISHA: Pop, pop, second attack.
This is so fucking fuck that--

2656
01:42:48.982 --> 01:42:50.990
LAURA: I'm going to throw up, how are we going to--

2657
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:55.835
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, so uppercut, ow,

2658
01:42:55.835 --> 01:42:58.550
and I'm going to just counter and do--

2659
01:42:58.550 --> 01:43:00.550
MATT: Like Shoryuken?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

2660
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:03.040
I'm going to Shoryuken him with a 25.

2661
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.120
MATT: That hits.

2662
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.160
So go ahead and roll your fist damage,

2663
01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.002
and then an additional 6d6 lightning damage.

2664
01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:14.170
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, so I'll do-- 6d6?

2665
01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:16.860
That's cool, all right, well, I'll start

2666
01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.910
with the basics, nine.

2667
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:24.780
And then plus, oh god, oh god.

2668
01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:27.099
Oh, I can do them all.
TRAVIS: Take your time.

2669
01:43:27.099 --> 01:43:31.960
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five.

2670
01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.400
Oh!
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

2671
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.630
That's good.
MARISHA: Okay.

2672
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:39.630
Nine plus another 10, so 19, plus six, 25,

2673
01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.660
plus another five, 30--

2674
01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:43.373
LAURA: 32.

2675
01:43:43.373 --> 01:43:44.960
MARISHA: 32,

2676
01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.440
36.

2677
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.660
MATT: Total?
MARISHA: Total.

2678
01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.493
MATT: Nice.

2679
01:43:49.935 --> 01:43:54.240
As you leap upward, full on jumping, uppercutting,

2680
01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.900
there's a burst of purple energy that arcs off

2681
01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:59.860
of the fist, blasts up its chest, and as it impacts,

2682
01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:02.550
you can see the arcs through its body.

2683
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:03.950
As you land, the energy is dispersed.

2684
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:05.490
That's the one attack you got with that,

2685
01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:07.020
there's no more energy in your fists.

2686
01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:09.530
But you did a pretty decent hit on it.

2687
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:11.090
You still have your bonus action.

2688
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:13.060
MARISHA: I did Step of the Wind.

2689
01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.580
I did Step of the Wind to get there--

2690
01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.320
MATT: That's right, so it's the end of your turn.

2691
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.112
All right, Beau's turn's over. The golem's turn.

2692
01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:22.010
It shuts down now.

2693
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.780
So for one round, it is shut down.

2694
01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.300
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: All right.

2695
01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.820
LAURA: Oh, but you could hit it again before it comes

2696
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.760
back on, that's good.

2697
01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:32.330
MATT: That means that Fjord, you're up.
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.

2698
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:36.138
TRAVIS: I will send two

2699
01:44:36.138 --> 01:44:37.663
Eldritch Blasts down the hall at it--

2700
01:44:37.663 --> 01:44:38.804
MATT: What's the range on an Eldritch Blast?

2701
01:44:38.804 --> 01:44:40.565
TRAVIS: 120.
MATT: 120 feet.

2702
01:44:40.565 --> 01:44:43.060
SAM: Caleb, put the collar around it.

2703
01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.190
MATT: Double checking the distance here.

2704
01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:50.790
TALIESIN: It doesn't use vocal, because there's no,

2705
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:51.970
that won't do anything.
SAM: You're right, you're right.

2706
01:44:51.970 --> 01:44:53.490
TRAVIS: It should be like at 110.

2707
01:44:54.346 --> 01:44:57.840
TALIESIN: I would have cast Silence a long time ago.

2708
01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:01.843
MATT: Yeah, you are, it's 120, 115, just within range.

2709
01:45:01.843 --> 01:45:03.868
TRAVIS: Step! (fires)
MATT: Yeah.

2710
01:45:03.868 --> 01:45:05.260
So go ahead and make the strike.

2711
01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:06.880
LIAM: What's that range, 120 for that?

2712
01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:09.160
TRAVIS: Yeah, 120, why did that go--?

2713
01:45:11.978 --> 01:45:14.510
My thing goes up here.

2714
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:15.710
TALIESIN: Which one was with the fire,

2715
01:45:15.710 --> 01:45:16.880
and which one was the lightning, by the way,

2716
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.850
out of curiosity, with the crossbolts?

2717
01:45:17.850 --> 01:45:18.910
SAM: We've got to get through this door.

2718
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:21.370
MATT: Fire was the left side, lightning was the right side.

2719
01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:22.203
TALIESIN: Your left.

2720
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:26.990
LAURA: This was the lightning.
TALIESIN: Lightning, fire, gotcha.

2721
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:30.330
TRAVIS: First one was a 21, second one is 25.

2722
01:45:30.330 --> 01:45:31.930
MATT: 25 is the first hit, you said?

2723
01:45:31.930 --> 01:45:33.850
TRAVIS: No, 21 is the first one, 25 is the--

2724
01:45:33.850 --> 01:45:35.010
MATT: Both hit, roll damage range.

2725
01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:36.268
MARISHA: No.
SAM: This place sucks,

2726
01:45:36.268 --> 01:45:37.376
we should leave.

2727
01:45:38.659 --> 01:45:39.502
Fjord, go!

2728
01:45:39.502 --> 01:45:43.244
TRAVIS: 14, 14, that's 12. (groaning)

2729
01:45:43.244 --> 01:45:46.860
LAURA: If Fjord doesn't take somebody across, that's--

2730
01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:48.860
You guys can fly.

2731
01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:52.520
TRAVIS: 29 points of force damage.
MATT: Nice.

2732
01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.550
It's now shut down and both blasts

2733
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:57.280
of the eldritch energy have

2734
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.270
that deeper green, forest green tint

2735
01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:01.570
to them, impact on each shoulder,

2736
01:46:01.570 --> 01:46:03.090
and you can see the blast marks it leaves

2737
01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:04.650
in its armor, as it rears back

2738
01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:08.560
and almost hits the top of the doorway,

2739
01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:09.820
actually being knocked off its axis,

2740
01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:10.850
and is now just leaning there,

2741
01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:13.040
as its body is solid in place.

2742
01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.740
That's your action?
TRAVIS: Yes.

2743
01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.420
MATT: Are you going to stay put or are you going to move?

2744
01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:20.370
TRAVIS: I will move up just in between the ballistas.

2745
01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:23.310
MATT: All righty, Fjord, that puts you over here.

2746
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:25.040
All righty, Fjord's turn's over, top of the round,

2747
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.040
Jester, you're good.

2748
01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:30.570
SAM: Get out of here, Jester! Leave!

2749
01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:34.930
LAURA: No, I can't leave you, I'm going to run up

2750
01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:38.608
and step on the other side of the golem.

2751
01:46:38.608 --> 01:46:41.200
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

2752
01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.360
LAURA: That's as close as I can get?

2753
01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.670
MATT: As close as you can get.

2754
01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:47.880
LAURA: Tight, tight, tight, tight.

2755
01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:51.720
SAM: Run, you fools, run.
MATT: Fly, you fools!

2756
01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.150
LAURA: Shit, that was the thing I was going to do,

2757
01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:56.980
and now I'm not, I can't, it's not within range.

2758
01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:58.070
SAM: Just leave!

2759
01:46:58.070 --> 01:47:00.435
LAURA: (closed-mouth scream)

2760
01:47:00.435 --> 01:47:03.134
(high-pitched nonsense)

2761
01:47:04.403 --> 01:47:05.445
LIAM: Bork, bork, bork!

2762
01:47:05.445 --> 01:47:06.370
TALIESIN: I feel that.

2763
01:47:06.370 --> 01:47:07.995
I don't know what it was, but I feel it.

2764
01:47:09.763 --> 01:47:10.596
MATT: Caleb, you're on deck.

2765
01:47:10.596 --> 01:47:15.010
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command again on it.

2766
01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:16.885
MARISHA: I caught it with my titty, does that count?

2767
01:47:18.052 --> 01:47:19.418
SAM: Just like in Blue Man Group.

2768
01:47:19.418 --> 01:47:22.335
LAURA: I cast Command again on him.

2769
01:47:24.334 --> 01:47:26.384
LIAM: No, there are no women allowed.

2770
01:47:26.384 --> 01:47:29.280
MATT: Okay, your spell, as you shout,

2771
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:32.090
finds deaf ears, because it is shut down

2772
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:33.310
and cannot listen to your Command word.

2773
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:35.910
LAURA: I was afraid of that.
SAM: Oh, damn it.

2774
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:36.743
LAURA: I was afraid of that.

2775
01:47:36.743 --> 01:47:37.937
I was going to just say "Stay off,"

2776
01:47:37.937 --> 01:47:39.312
but it didn't work.

2777
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:43.240
SAM and LAURA: And stay off!

2778
01:47:44.193 --> 01:47:46.270
MATT: It's just still leaning against the doorway,

2779
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:48.110
smoke rising from the impact of the Eldritch Blasts.

2780
01:47:48.110 --> 01:47:49.276
LAURA: Balls and balls.

2781
01:47:49.276 --> 01:47:52.240
Can I use my bonus action to keep moving?

2782
01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.095
TRAVIS: Can you banish it?
MATT: Unfortunately, that's not an ability--

2783
01:47:54.095 --> 01:47:55.270
LAURA: That's not an ability I have.

2784
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:56.103
MATT: Yeah, that's a rogue--

2785
01:47:56.103 --> 01:47:57.670
LAURA: I don't have Banishment prepared.

2786
01:47:57.670 --> 01:47:58.503
TRAVIS: Sorry.

2787
01:47:59.661 --> 01:48:00.785
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Jester?
LAURA: I don't have any

2788
01:48:00.785 --> 01:48:03.390
real fighting stuff prepared.

2789
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:05.210
That's the end of my turn.
MATT: Okay.

2790
01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:06.280
Finishes it. Caleb, you're up.

2791
01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.130
LIAM: I'm going to start walking up toward Fjord,

2792
01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:12.030
past him, and as I do so, I am calling out:

2793
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:15.360
Jester, anyone, paint, pitch, cover its face.

2794
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:17.580
I slide molasses along my hand,

2795
01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.100
and hand in a circle, and I cast Slow on it.

2796
01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.110
MATT: Slow on it?
LIAM: Yeah.

2797
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:24.900
MATT: Okay, and that is a what saving throw?

2798
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:26.710
LIAM: That is wisdom.
MATT: Wisdom saving throw--

2799
01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:28.350
TALIESIN: Can it make a saving throw while it's off?

2800
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:29.183
MATT: Yeah, it still makes it.

2801
01:48:29.183 --> 01:48:30.080
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

2802
01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:33.810
MATT: Command specifically because it has to hear the word,

2803
01:48:33.810 --> 01:48:35.580
and it rolled really high, so.
TALIESIN: I know, I know, I know.

2804
01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:37.310
MATT: That's my narrative way for doing it.

2805
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:38.440
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

2806
01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.336
MATT: It rolled really high again.
LIAM: Goddamn it.

2807
01:48:40.336 --> 01:48:42.080
MATT: Yeah, that's 18.

2808
01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.410
LIAM: Son of a fuck.

2809
01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:46.220
MATT: Sorry, it resists the slow.
TRAVIS: Good call, though.

2810
01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:47.190
Good fucking call.

2811
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:49.490
MATT: Finishing Caleb's turn, Caduceus, you're up.

2812
01:48:50.650 --> 01:48:55.650
TALIESIN: I'm going to, really quickly, are those crossbow,

2813
01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:59.680
do they seem moveable at all, or do they?

2814
01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.810
MATT: You glance at the base, the bottom half you can see

2815
01:49:01.810 --> 01:49:03.020
beneath the sheets that are over it,

2816
01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:06.471
and it looks like there is a rotational element there.

2817
01:49:06.471 --> 01:49:08.780
MARISHA: Oh yeah!
TALIESIN: I'm just going to

2818
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:13.440
run over to the electric one.

2819
01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.172
MATT: Okay, over there.

2820
01:49:15.172 --> 01:49:16.500
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and see if there's a way

2821
01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.720
to aim it and fire--

2822
01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:18.840
MATT: You've got to pull the sheet off of it.

2823
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.323
TALIESIN: I'll pull the sheet off.
MATT: You yank the sheet off of it.

2824
01:49:20.323 --> 01:49:21.898
As you do, you can see the design of it.

2825
01:49:21.898 --> 01:49:23.772
The whole front of it is made of this

2826
01:49:23.772 --> 01:49:28.487
ivory-type wood, but it's too smooth,

2827
01:49:28.487 --> 01:49:29.610
there's no striations of it.

2828
01:49:29.610 --> 01:49:32.180
So it looks, strangely enough,

2829
01:49:34.190 --> 01:49:37.280
Nott, you, glancing over, see it,

2830
01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.010
you can see this faint glowing elements

2831
01:49:39.010 --> 01:49:41.120
to it that pulse, and the design

2832
01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.270
of it is weirdly alien and strange.

2833
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:48.098
It reminds you of something you saw in Mythburrow,

2834
01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:51.000
encased in the ice of the dragon's lair.

2835
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.570
LAURA: Whoa!

2836
01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:53.750
TRAVIS: Iceflex.

2837
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:54.620
MATT: Just something similar about it.

2838
01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:55.910
Not iceflex.
LAURA: No, no. Remember it was--

2839
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:58.790
MATT: There was just something weird, just something weird.

2840
01:49:58.790 --> 01:50:01.480
Anyway, just a note. As you pull off the sheet

2841
01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.540
and look, there is actually a seat compartment in it,

2842
01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:07.850
like a small chair that you can get up into.

2843
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:08.840
LAURA: Do it.
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up,

2844
01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:09.890
I'm going to get up into it.

2845
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:11.717
MATT: Okay.

2846
01:50:11.717 --> 01:50:13.817
LAURA: Why didn't we do that earlier?

2847
01:50:13.817 --> 01:50:15.200
MATT: As you get into it, you can see there's

2848
01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.190
actually a couple, there's a couple levers

2849
01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:19.830
that you can pull to rotate it and aim,

2850
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:23.020
and as you pull them, it whirs a bit.

2851
01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:25.950
You guys are watching Caduceus go, oh,

2852
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:27.250
and start playing with this thing.

2853
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:28.850
Go ahead and make an intelligence check for me.

2854
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:30.740
TALIESIN: Oh, god, the worst.
TRAVIS: Come on, baby, come on.

2855
01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:32.680
TALIESIN: I can add a d4 to that.
TRAVIS: Come on!

2856
01:50:33.705 --> 01:50:35.555
LAURA: But you're so stupid.
TRAVIS: Guide him.

2857
01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:38.300
LAURA: I can't guide him, but he can guide himself.

2858
01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:40.320
TALIESIN: I can if I will--
MATT: That's an action, though.

2859
01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.020
TALIESIN: It's an action, so I'm not doing it.

2860
01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:43.880
Intelligence check.
MARISHA: Come on.

2861
01:50:44.822 --> 01:50:45.655
Come on, country boy.

2862
01:50:47.070 --> 01:50:50.050
TALIESIN: Four.
(laughter)

2863
01:50:50.050 --> 01:50:55.050
MATT: Okay, all that you know is you see a series

2864
01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:58.860
of buttons, strange, I wouldn't say buttons,

2865
01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:02.290
but symbols with levers on them that pull.

2866
01:51:02.290 --> 01:51:05.270
You see one that's like a weird green symbol,

2867
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:08.530
one that's a weird red symbol, a blue symbol,

2868
01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:12.470
or like a pale blue symbol, and then a bright

2869
01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:18.370
embossed blue symbol, and then there's a dull,

2870
01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:21.010
a dull pale green, those are the five.

2871
01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:23.430
So you have deep green,

2872
01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:29.980
red, light blue, intense blue, and dull green.

2873
01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:33.660
TRAVIS: We saw green, it's that cloud, red is probably fire,

2874
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:34.960
one of the blues is no magic,

2875
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.480
the other one's probably lightning.

2876
01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.482
TALIESIN: Oh. (stammering)

2877
01:51:40.482 --> 01:51:41.315
LAURA: Hit the bright blue.

2878
01:51:41.315 --> 01:51:43.790
TALIESIN: What?
SAM: Cut the red wire.

2879
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:45.830
TALIESIN: I'll hit the bright blue.

2880
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:48.490
MATT: The vibrant blue?
TALIESIN: The light blue.

2881
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:50.006
LAURA: Or the vibrant blue.
MATT: The middle one, you mean.

2882
01:51:50.006 --> 01:51:51.360
TALIESIN: Yeah, the middle one, yeah.

2883
01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.270
MATT: You hit the middle button. You watch as the sigils

2884
01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:59.230
on the front of the ballistas begin to, and as they glow,

2885
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:02.000
you see additional glyphs appear a few inches away from it

2886
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.310
that are larger and spinning and clicking together,

2887
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:06.530
as they all meet in the center, and it's a brief moment

2888
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:09.510
of it holding, and it fires forth.

2889
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:13.120
What you can see is a ball of condensed frost energy

2890
01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:16.980
that fires in a straight line down the hall,

2891
01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:19.080
right towards the golem.

2892
01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.011
Roll 4d10 for me, please.

2893
01:52:21.011 --> 01:52:23.210
TRAVIS: 4d10?!

2894
01:52:27.730 --> 01:52:30.240
TRAVIS: Roll better than a four, roll better than a four.

2895
01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:34.240
TALIESIN: Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 20.

2896
01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.820
MATT: 20, okay, it does not make it saving throw,

2897
01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:38.080
even with advantage, which is surprising,

2898
01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.690
because actually really good at that one.

2899
01:52:39.690 --> 01:52:42.760
So 20, it takes 20 points of cold damage,

2900
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.130
and you see frost gather on its body,

2901
01:52:45.130 --> 01:52:47.840
and it, like there's actually a reminiscent,

2902
01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.180
like a lingering cold effect on it.

2903
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:53.034
MARISHA: That's cool.
TALIESIN: Cool.

2904
01:52:53.034 --> 01:52:54.820
MATT: That's your action and movement.
TALIESIN: That's my action, all right.

2905
01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:57.460
MATT: That finishes Caduceus's turn. Nott, you're up.

2906
01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:00.040
SAM: Seeing that. (laughs)
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2907
01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.708
SAM: I'm going to jump into the other one!

2908
01:53:01.708 --> 01:53:03.558
MATT: Okay, Nott, you jump over,

2909
01:53:06.434 --> 01:53:09.400
pull the cloak, the piece of cloth off the other,

2910
01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.070
leap up into its seat, it's a little big for you,

2911
01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:13.410
but you can lean up over, booster seat-esque,

2912
01:53:13.410 --> 01:53:15.440
to see. You see the same things in front of you.

2913
01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.273
Make an intelligence check for me.

2914
01:53:16.273 --> 01:53:19.370
TRAVIS: Hey, I got one! Nice going, kid, don't get cocky.

2915
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:20.520
SAM: Intelligence?
MATT: Yes.

2916
01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:24.140
SAM: Seven.
MATT: Seven?

2917
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:25.990
You see the same symbols in front of you.

2918
01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:29.620
SAM: Captain Tusktooth, permission to fire?

2919
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.410
TRAVIS: Permission granted!

2920
01:53:32.410 --> 01:53:33.850
SAM: I'll just hit that same one.

2921
01:53:33.850 --> 01:53:34.683
MATT: Same one?

2922
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.200
Ball of blue condensed cold energy fires out once more

2923
01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:44.830
towards the golem, straight down the center of the hallway.

2924
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:46.940
Go ahead and roll 4d10 damage.

2925
01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:47.773
SAM: Okay, okay.

2926
01:53:47.773 --> 01:53:48.730
MATT: He does make a saving throw this time--

2927
01:53:48.730 --> 01:53:50.405
SAM: I've never rolled a d10.
MATT: -- so it's half damage.

2928
01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:53.780
SAM: No, no.
TALIESIN: So he half,

2929
01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:55.000
half damage.
SAM: 20.

2930
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:55.833
LAURA: Crazy!

2931
01:53:55.833 --> 01:53:58.190
MATT: All right, so it takes 10 points of cold damage.

2932
01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:02.235
The same element, of the same frost energy is left

2933
01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:04.800
around it, that finishes your turn.

2934
01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.230
SAM: I think so.

2935
01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:08.570
MATT: Beauregard, you're up.

2936
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:13.127
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.
LAURA: Pop, pop. (laughs)

2937
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:17.690
MARISHA: I'm just, do I see any weak spots in his armor?

2938
01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:20.170
MATT: I mean, you can see, it's built humanoid,

2939
01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:21.720
and you can gather that there are elements

2940
01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:22.880
of a body on the inside,

2941
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.660
where a lot of the arcane forces are.

2942
01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:28.012
You don't know exactly, but you can certainly try.

2943
01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:35.080
MARISHA: I'm just going to keep, yeah, I don't like his mug,

2944
01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:38.354
and whack, whack, I'm going to keep going for it.

2945
01:54:38.354 --> 01:54:40.340
TRAVIS: Come on, this side of beef, break those--

2946
01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.798
MATT: Be confident with that, be confident.

2947
01:54:41.798 --> 01:54:43.480
MARISHA: Two, pop, pop right there.

2948
01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:45.255
First attack, first attack!

2949
01:54:45.255 --> 01:54:47.454
Natural one.

2950
01:54:47.454 --> 01:54:49.280
MATT: Well, be fair, that's about the gusto you had

2951
01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.665
with that first attack.

2952
01:54:50.665 --> 01:54:53.330
MARISHA: Yeah, come at me, come at me.

2953
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:55.430
MATT: You can see its face flickering,

2954
01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:58.570
preparing itself, and you swing, and it

2955
01:54:58.570 --> 01:55:00.240
glances off the face, the second strike?

2956
01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:01.073
MARISHA: 22.

2957
01:55:01.073 --> 01:55:02.080
MATT: 22 hits, so roll damage.

2958
01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.670
MARISHA: Okay, he's coming back on.

2959
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:08.600
Uh-huh, 12 damage.
MATT: All righty.

2960
01:55:09.450 --> 01:55:11.350
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

2961
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:13.670
He's going to have a stupid con. There's no way.

2962
01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:14.978
MATT: He would if he hadn't rolled a natural one.

2963
01:55:14.978 --> 01:55:18.200
(cheering)

2964
01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.150
So he is stunned.

2965
01:55:20.419 --> 01:55:22.810
LAURA: ♪ I love stunning strike ♪
MATT: Not immune to stun.

2966
01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:24.640
SAM: Should we flee, or should we just sit here

2967
01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:25.810
and just fucking kill it?

2968
01:55:25.810 --> 01:55:28.440
MATT: After the glancing blow hits across its face,

2969
01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.220
you see, as you get low, holding your knuckles,

2970
01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:32.960
you look up, and right in its abdomen,

2971
01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.760
beneath the first part of where the stone armor ends

2972
01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.990
and the metallic bits are on the inside,

2973
01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:39.880
you can see little elements of energy,

2974
01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:41.420
charging from the inside.

2975
01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.210
You then reach in and punch upward,

2976
01:55:43.210 --> 01:55:44.793
and just grab and tug, and as you do,

2977
01:55:44.793 --> 01:55:47.670
it burns your hand a little bit, you're like,

2978
01:55:47.670 --> 01:55:50.760
but you see it begin to shock

2979
01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.260
and take a moment. It's stunned.

2980
01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:53.480
So that's your action.

2981
01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.320
TRAVIS: Got to keep working it, this is an advantage--

2982
01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.950
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

2983
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:59.260
Especially while he's stunned, I'm going to be like:

2984
01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:03.180
I think he's off for maybe one more turn, and--

2985
01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:04.720
SAM: What's a turn?
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

2986
01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.320
MATT: Okay, two more strikes with advantage

2987
01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:07.940
because he is stunned.
MARISHA: Yeah!

2988
01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:09.490
LIAM: Just got to follow up [Inaudible] whole place.

2989
01:56:09.490 --> 01:56:11.400
TALIESIN: Yeah, we got to get it now.
MARISHA: Ooh, ooh, ooh!

2990
01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.620
Natural 19, 29.
MATT: That hits.

2991
01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:17.440
Nine damage.
MATT: All righty.

2992
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:21.350
MARISHA: 26 damage.
MATT: All righty.

2993
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:24.320
MARISHA: Sorry, 26 to hit, 26 to hit.
MATT: 26 to hit, yep.

2994
01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:26.120
MARISHA: 10 damage.
MATT: Nice, all right.

2995
01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:29.220
MARISHA: Extract Aspects.
MATT: All right.

2996
01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:33.110
It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage,

2997
01:56:33.110 --> 01:56:34.290
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing

2998
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:36.690
from non-magical weapons that aren't adamantine.

2999
01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:39.850
It cannot be charmed, it cannot be exhausted,

3000
01:56:39.850 --> 01:56:41.310
it cannot be frightened, it cannot be paralyzed,

3001
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:43.210
it cannot be petrified, and cannot be poisoned.

3002
01:56:43.210 --> 01:56:45.590
LAURA: Holy shit.
MARISHA: Okay.

3003
01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:46.600
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: And fire heals it.

3004
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:49.510
TRAVIS: Is my sword made from fucking adamantine?

3005
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:51.670
MATT: Non-magical weapons.
Magical weapons can still affect it,

3006
01:56:51.670 --> 01:56:52.870
and that's how you're able to punch it.

3007
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:57.870
SAM: So he can only be hit by lightning or cold, right?

3008
01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:59.120
MATT: It's immune to poison.

3009
01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:01.130
MARISHA: It's immune to poison, wait, so poison--

3010
01:57:01.130 --> 01:57:02.130
MATT: Poison and psychic damage.

3011
01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:03.440
LAURA: But radiant and necrotic,

3012
01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:05.803
it would still get hit by.-
MATT: Radiant and necrotic.

3013
01:57:05.803 --> 01:57:08.853
MARISHA: It doesn't have a brain to give brain damage to.

3014
01:57:08.853 --> 01:57:11.670
MATT: Technically, it is considered, I mean,

3015
01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:14.470
fire isn't an immunity, fire is an absorption.

3016
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:15.303
I'll throw that out there, as well,

3017
01:57:15.303 --> 01:57:17.290
but you figured that out earlier.

3018
01:57:17.290 --> 01:57:18.473
MARISHA: Okay.

3019
01:57:18.473 --> 01:57:21.100
MATT: All right, that finishes your go, Beauregard.

3020
01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.890
All right.
TRAVIS: What's its greatest fear?

3021
01:57:22.890 --> 01:57:27.260
MATT: The golem, the face turns on, but it is stunned.

3022
01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:32.260
That means it can't move, but it goes ahead

3023
01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:34.870
and turns its face towards Jester,

3024
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:39.715
and the anti-magic cone opens up in front of it.

3025
01:57:39.715 --> 01:57:40.970
MARISHA: It's back on.

3026
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:44.730
LAURA: I feel so weak and normal.

3027
01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:46.680
SAM: Including these, maybe.

3028
01:57:47.670 --> 01:57:49.290
We can't shoot it with the ballista anymore.

3029
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:50.123
LAURA: No, you can.

3030
01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:54.130
LIAM: No, well the magic will get negated.

3031
01:57:54.130 --> 01:57:56.120
MATT: I'll leave the piece up here,

3032
01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.087
because this is where it's turning, facing towards--

3033
01:57:58.087 --> 01:57:59.670
LAURA: So you could still get it with Caduceus'.

3034
01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:00.670
TRAVIS: One of them could.

3035
01:58:02.399 --> 01:58:04.735
MATT: So we'll say it's about there, I'll go ahead

3036
01:58:04.735 --> 01:58:09.301
and leave this here, up,

3037
01:58:09.301 --> 01:58:11.409
to help just keep this going here.

3038
01:58:11.409 --> 01:58:14.910
There we go.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

3039
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:17.460
MATT: So that brings us to Fjord.

3040
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.800
TRAVIS: Yes, I will move forward in front of the ballista

3041
01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:24.580
and hug the far wall, just on the other side of the column,

3042
01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.410
yeah, put my butt in that corner,

3043
01:58:26.410 --> 01:58:30.940
and I will fire two more Eldritch Blasts down the hallway.

3044
01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.140
TALIESIN: With advantage still, because he is--

3045
01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:35.670
MATT: With advantage, because he is, yes.

3046
01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:39.830
TRAVIS: Great, the first one is a 27,

3047
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:41.300
and the second one is a 28.

3048
01:58:43.386 --> 01:58:45.419
MATT: Let's see.

3049
01:58:45.419 --> 01:58:47.550
Let me double check one thing here, too.

3050
01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.470
It's not an action, you just moved its head.

3051
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:51.430
Okay, sorry, so what was that?

3052
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:53.630
TRAVIS: 27, and then 28.
MATT: Both hit, roll damage.

3053
01:58:56.018 --> 01:58:57.440
TRAVIS: Nine, or no, that's

3054
01:58:59.476 --> 01:59:02.930
a 14, plus, 14 plus 12, 26.

3055
01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:05.190
MATT: 26, nice.
TRAVIS: 26 points of force damage.

3056
01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.330
MATT: From that side, the impact's blasting.

3057
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:10.310
You see its stone armor starting to crack a bit

3058
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:12.610
on one part of its shoulder and chest area.

3059
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:15.580
It's showing some wear, showing some wear.

3060
01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:17.400
TRAVIS: That is my turn.
MATT: All right.

3061
01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.641
Top of the round, Jester, you're up.

3062
01:59:19.641 --> 01:59:22.131
You can see the blue glow. Its head is turned there,

3063
01:59:22.131 --> 01:59:23.360
and not moving as it's stunned in place,

3064
01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.810
and it had to turn its head your direction

3065
01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:27.935
to even send the cone that way.

3066
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:31.690
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to move to where I'm not

3067
01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:34.100
in its cone.
MATT: Which direction?

3068
01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:36.270
LAURA: Behind it, away from Beau.

3069
01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:39.110
MATT: Okay, so you move five, 10, 15.

3070
01:59:39.110 --> 01:59:40.830
You're just outside of the cone on that end there.

3071
01:59:40.830 --> 01:59:42.810
LAURA: I'm going to get close, I'm going to get right next

3072
01:59:42.810 --> 01:59:44.160
to it.
MATT: Right next to it?

3073
01:59:51.535 --> 01:59:54.610
LAURA: There's so many things to do, but also,

3074
01:59:54.610 --> 01:59:57.690
I think I'm going to try to do what you guys shouted at me.

3075
01:59:57.690 --> 01:59:59.780
Do you think that's dumb? I've been a waste

3076
01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:02.760
of space this whole time.
SAM: What, you're going to leave?

3077
02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:05.000
LIAM: No, Caleb, shouted out to
throw an ink pot at its face.

3078
02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:09.466
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my paints,

3079
02:00:09.466 --> 02:00:11.280
not my magical paints,

3080
02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:14.690
just some regular paint, and I'm going to paint it all

3081
02:00:14.690 --> 02:00:16.890
over his face, like black paint,

3082
02:00:16.890 --> 02:00:19.040
to try to cover up where the beam would be.

3083
02:00:20.250 --> 02:00:22.642
SAM: Regular paint, regular paint.

3084
02:00:22.642 --> 02:00:24.614
LAURA: Is this really dumb?

3085
02:00:24.614 --> 02:00:25.777
MATT: No, give it a shot, all right, go ahead,

3086
02:00:25.777 --> 02:00:28.112
and I'll say roll a performance check.

3087
02:00:29.962 --> 02:00:32.080
SAM: Come on, come on, come on, come on.

3088
02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.470
LAURA: Eight, I mean--

3089
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:34.303
SAM: What?

3090
02:00:34.303 --> 02:00:37.190
MATT: Okay, you paint across it, Banksy it real fast.

3091
02:00:39.874 --> 02:00:41.220
It now has all these black smears

3092
02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:42.286
across it of dark paint.
SAM: Paint him blue so

3093
02:00:42.286 --> 02:00:44.035
he can look like me earlier tonight.

3094
02:00:44.035 --> 02:00:46.031
MATT: Nobody wants that.

3095
02:00:46.031 --> 02:00:47.580
Nobody wants that.
TALIESIN: Nobody wants that.

3096
02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:50.020
LAURA: And then I'm going to, as my bonus action,

3097
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:53.700
cast Spiritual Weapon.

3098
02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:58.120
MATT: Okay, just so you're aware, you mark it with paint,

3099
02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.820
and the blue sigil still shines through.

3100
02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:04.697
The effect is strangely more powerful than paint.

3101
02:01:06.114 --> 02:01:07.730
Sorry.
LAURA: Surprising, but--

3102
02:01:07.730 --> 02:01:09.130
SAM: You did great, you did great.

3103
02:01:09.130 --> 02:01:11.300
MATT: But it was a worthy shot, it was a worthy shot.

3104
02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:13.660
LAURA: You know, you've got to think sometimes.

3105
02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:15.090
Okay, fine--

3106
02:01:15.090 --> 02:01:16.920
MATT: From the non-magical paint, anyway, so there you go.

3107
02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:19.040
LAURA: But I could have used magical paint on his beam.

3108
02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:19.873
MATT: I know.

3109
02:01:19.873 --> 02:01:22.210
LAURA: It would have just gotten, yeah, so fuck it.

3110
02:01:22.210 --> 02:01:24.810
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

3111
02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:26.120
MATT: All righty.

3112
02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:29.230
LAURA: At a 3rd-level.

3113
02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:31.410
MATT: And where do you want it?

3114
02:01:31.410 --> 02:01:33.010
LAURA: Behind his head.
MATT: All right.

3115
02:01:35.010 --> 02:01:38.140
LAURA: And he is going to hit it.

3116
02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:40.550
MATT: Go ahead and roll it.

3117
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:42.460
LAURA: That would be 25.

3118
02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:43.465
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage

3119
02:01:43.465 --> 02:01:46.990
with your Spiritual Weapon.

3120
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:50.560
LAURA: 11 points.
MATT: 11 points of damage, nice.

3121
02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:52.220
Slams into the back of its head.

3122
02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:54.300
The cone shifts slightly from the impact,

3123
02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:55.990
and then it moves back to where it was.

3124
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:59.910
That finishes your turn, Caleb?

3125
02:01:59.910 --> 02:02:01.060
LAURA: Should I roll with advantage

3126
02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:02.790
because in case it's a natural 20?

3127
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:04.770
MATT: That's true, yeah, just in case you want to go,

3128
02:02:04.770 --> 02:02:05.820
natural 20--
LAURA: Nope, I didn't.

3129
02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:07.760
MATT: No, but yeah, good call, Caleb?

3130
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.390
LIAM: How high is the ceiling in here?

3131
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:11.520
MATT: 40 feet.
LIAM: 40 feet, okay.

3132
02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:17.000
A catmint in hand, a small spectral Frumpkin floats

3133
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.290
in the air above it for a second,

3134
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:22.280
then a giant hand, down from above.

3135
02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:23.500
MATT: From whereabouts?

3136
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.120
LIAM: From above its head.

3137
02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.010
MATT: Above it?
LIAM: Yeah.

3138
02:02:26.010 --> 02:02:28.171
MATT: All right, we'll say right there, you got it.

3139
02:02:28.171 --> 02:02:30.271
TRAVIS: It looks awesome in that light.

3140
02:02:30.271 --> 02:02:31.954
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's got a vibe.

3141
02:02:31.954 --> 02:02:34.227
TRAVIS: Got a little Kirby going on. A little Jack Kirby.

3142
02:02:34.227 --> 02:02:35.343
MARISHA: Yeah, it does.

3143
02:02:35.343 --> 02:02:37.708
LIAM: And that is 4d8.

3144
02:02:39.070 --> 02:02:41.810
10, 17, 25.

3145
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:42.930
MATT: 25, to hit?

3146
02:02:42.930 --> 02:02:44.620
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

3147
02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:46.950
LIAM: Oh, do I have to roll to hit, or it just hits?

3148
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:48.000
MATT: For the claw strike,

3149
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.740
I think you still have to roll to hit.

3150
02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:51.390
LIAM: Make a melee, thank you, sorry,

3151
02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:53.714
it's been a while.
MATT: It's okay, but you're rolling damage.

3152
02:02:53.714 --> 02:02:55.845
You do have advantage on the attack because it is stunned.

3153
02:02:55.845 --> 02:02:57.320
LIAM: Good, good.

3154
02:02:58.310 --> 02:03:02.770
11 plus, oh, I haven't used this spell in forever.

3155
02:03:02.770 --> 02:03:04.470
Come on, catch up with me, spells.

3156
02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:08.990
That is a 20.
MATT: 20 just hits.

3157
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.823
SAM: Whoa.

3158
02:03:09.823 --> 02:03:11.810
MATT: So what's the damage on that, that is--

3159
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:14.930
LIAM: 16, 22, 26.

3160
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:18.610
MATT: 26 points of damage, what type of damage?

3161
02:03:18.610 --> 02:03:20.200
LIAM: Slashing.
MATT: Slashing damage.

3162
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:22.840
LIAM: 28 total.
MATT: Got you.

3163
02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.070
The claws arc into it, and streaking across its armor,

3164
02:03:26.070 --> 02:03:28.000
the metal twists from the impact,

3165
02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.960
as it curves down the back of its head and its shoulders.

3166
02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:33.100
Yeah, you carved a pretty decent chunk into it.

3167
02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:39.090
LIAM: I'm going to go hide behind Nott over here.

3168
02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:40.040
MATT: Okay, you got it.

3169
02:03:42.111 --> 02:03:43.580
That brings us to Caduceus.

3170
02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:45.050
TALIESIN: What's the other blue one do? (clicks)

3171
02:03:46.985 --> 02:03:49.460
MATT: All right, well, make an intelligence check for me.

3172
02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:50.860
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.
TRAVIS: Come on.

3173
02:03:53.650 --> 02:03:54.753
TALIESIN: Five.
MATT: Five.

3174
02:03:54.753 --> 02:03:56.280
TRAVIS: (yelling) Four and a five?!

3175
02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.626
MATT: Yeah, you're like-- so you just hit the other blue?

3176
02:03:59.626 --> 02:04:00.459
All right.

3177
02:04:01.876 --> 02:04:04.690
The runes that glow, but they're all matching the color

3178
02:04:04.690 --> 02:04:05.900
of this sigil that you're pressing

3179
02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.150
and pulling the lever on, and as it does,

3180
02:04:08.150 --> 02:04:10.930
it centers, a single arc of lightning,

3181
02:04:10.930 --> 02:04:13.010
the one that you saw when you first arrived,

3182
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:15.160
across the chamber, the entire length

3183
02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:17.900
of the chamber into it, slamming into it.

3184
02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:19.950
Go ahead and roll 6d10 for me.

3185
02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:22.300
TRAVIS: 6d10!

3186
02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:23.133
SAM: Come on!

3187
02:04:24.010 --> 02:04:27.040
TALIESIN: Nope, that's not a d10, yeah, if you've got,

3188
02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.620
actually, if you've got one more even.

3189
02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:30.550
LAURA: Yes, I do, here, hold.

3190
02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:33.295
LAURA: There you are.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3191
02:04:36.418 --> 02:04:40.020
Hey, that's exciting!
LAURA: Oh, that's so good.

3192
02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:43.320
TALIESIN: All right, let's see, that's 18.

3193
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.370
LAURA: Holy shit.

3194
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:49.800
TALIESIN: That's 18, plus 16, plus 14,

3195
02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.990
my brain can't do math right now--

3196
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:52.580
LAURA: Hold on, hold on.
SAM: 48.

3197
02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:56.600
TALIESIN: 18, plus 16, plus--
LAURA: 18, 27, 35.

3198
02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:59.827
TALIESIN: 42.
SAM: 42, 49.

3199
02:04:59.827 --> 02:05:01.680
MATT: 49 points of lightning damage.

3200
02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.800
TALIESIN: Nine, nine, eight, eight, seven, seven.

3201
02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:04.250
MATT: He does succeed on a save,

3202
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:06.650
so it takes 24 points lightning damage.

3203
02:05:06.650 --> 02:05:08.900
It blasts into it, and then expands

3204
02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:12.160
into a large blast, radial lightning energy.

3205
02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:15.750
I need both Beauregard and Jester to make dexterity,

3206
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:18.640
sorry, make constitution, no, dexterity saving throws.

3207
02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:21.470
You have disadvantage because you're wearing metal armor.

3208
02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:22.303
TALIESIN: Sorry.

3209
02:05:24.365 --> 02:05:26.698
SAM: La la la la, la la la la la la.

3210
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:29.230
MARISHA: 21.

3211
02:05:29.230 --> 02:05:31.440
MATT: You take 24 points of lightning damage.

3212
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.750
MARISHA: Was that a success or a failure?

3213
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:34.400
MATT: That was a success.

3214
02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.990
MARISHA: Evasion, no damage.
MATT: You take no damage.

3215
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:38.770
You just push your way--
TALIESIN: I am so sorry if you--

3216
02:05:38.770 --> 02:05:39.603
MATT: Jester.

3217
02:05:39.603 --> 02:05:41.000
LAURA: Six.
MATT: Six?

3218
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.360
You take 49 points of lightning damage.

3219
02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:43.193
TALIESIN: So sorry!

3220
02:05:43.193 --> 02:05:46.510
LIAM: Bigby's Hand, or Cat's Ire, wocka wocka,

3221
02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:47.770
rolled a 14.

3222
02:05:47.770 --> 02:05:49.240
MATT: 14 is a failure, so it takes 49 points

3223
02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:50.820
of lightning damage.

3224
02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:53.518
TALIESIN: Sorry.
SAM: It has as much as you.

3225
02:05:53.518 --> 02:05:55.600
MATT: The problem is not understanding this stuff sometimes,

3226
02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:56.660
and experimenting with it.

3227
02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:59.580
TALIESIN: Okay, that's interesting, okay, not that again.

3228
02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:01.770
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn, Caduceus?

3229
02:06:04.329 --> 02:06:06.429
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah--
TRAVIS: There's a purple button?

3230
02:06:07.290 --> 02:06:08.800
LAURA: No, there's a--

3231
02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:10.570
TRAVIS: Two blues, a green, a red, and--?

3232
02:06:10.570 --> 02:06:13.620
MATT: Yeah, there's a deep green, a red,

3233
02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:15.680
a light blue, an intense bright blue,

3234
02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:18.034
and a pale green.

3235
02:06:18.034 --> 02:06:19.092
TRAVIS: Pale green.

3236
02:06:19.092 --> 02:06:21.406
LAURA: It's probably, like, poison.

3237
02:06:21.406 --> 02:06:23.230
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Acid.

3238
02:06:23.230 --> 02:06:24.730
TALIESIN: I'm just going to yell over:

3239
02:06:24.730 --> 02:06:26.696
Okay, experimentation is bad,

3240
02:06:26.696 --> 02:06:28.300
deep blue, apparently. Sorry!

3241
02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:31.060
MATT: Caduceus' go. Nott, you're up.

3242
02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:32.960
SAM: I don't have a clear shot without going

3243
02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.120
into the anti-magic field.

3244
02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:35.620
MATT: You're not sure, from what you can see,

3245
02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:37.330
the blue is heading your direction.

3246
02:06:37.330 --> 02:06:38.711
It's hard to tell, you wouldn't know unless you tried it.

3247
02:06:38.711 --> 02:06:41.867
LAURA: Can you wheel the thing?
LIAM: Bank shot.

3248
02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.900
SAM: Sure, if I can't tell, I'll take a shot

3249
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:47.080
with that--
TRAVIS: Just shoot Jester--

3250
02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:48.880
MATT: Make an intelligence check for me.

3251
02:06:49.715 --> 02:06:50.715
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

3252
02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:55.810
SAM: 11.
MATT: 11, okay.

3253
02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:59.350
Yeah, still not quite sure exactly what

3254
02:06:59.350 --> 02:07:00.660
and how things work with this yet.

3255
02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:04.040
SAM: You feel like I feel now, frustrated.

3256
02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:04.873
MATT: So what do you do?

3257
02:07:04.873 --> 02:07:07.368
SAM: I'll just go with the same one, blue.

3258
02:07:07.368 --> 02:07:09.026
Light blue.
MATT: Okay.

3259
02:07:12.490 --> 02:07:15.410
It fires forward the ball of condensed cold energy,

3260
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:18.417
and it just vanishes at the cusp

3261
02:07:18.417 --> 02:07:22.450
of its visual range, unfortunately.

3262
02:07:22.450 --> 02:07:23.300
TALIESIN: Worth learning.

3263
02:07:24.265 --> 02:07:26.152
MATT: All right, you staying put?

3264
02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.160
SAM: Yeah, it can't do anything to me.

3265
02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:30.860
MATT: Okay, finish Nott's turn, Beau, you're up.

3266
02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:34.250
MARISHA: Is he still, he's still stunned till--

3267
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:36.120
MATT: Till the end of your turn.
MARISHA: My turn?

3268
02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:39.053
MATT: Correct, it's fucking balls.

3269
02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:44.020
TRAVIS: This is the only chance we have.

3270
02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:47.620
MARISHA: Pop pop.

3271
02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.290
28, naturally.
MATT: 28 hits.

3272
02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.700
LAURA: Do you still have ki points?

3273
02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:56.180
MARISHA: That sucked, seven. I do still have ki points.

3274
02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:59.301
Second-- oh, can I re-stun him?

3275
02:07:59.301 --> 02:08:00.360
MATT: If you want to.
LAURA: You've done it before.

3276
02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:02.000
LIAM: Come on.

3277
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.230
Beauregard.
LAURA: It's smart. Do it.

3278
02:08:03.230 --> 02:08:04.570
LIAM: Do it, nerd.
LAURA: We're going to die--

3279
02:08:04.570 --> 02:08:06.820
MARISHA: Re-stun.
MATT: All righty.

3280
02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:08.010
MARISHA: Stay off, stay off.

3281
02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:10.286
MATT: That is a 17. What's your DC?

3282
02:08:10.286 --> 02:08:13.380
MARISHA: Nope, he succeeds, he succeeds,

3283
02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:15.560
use that, yeah, yeah, that's fine, confirm.

3284
02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:17.180
Get rid of that, it's fine, it's fine.

3285
02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:20.450
He's still stunned, pop pop, 25.

3286
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:21.283
MATT: Hits.

3287
02:08:23.690 --> 02:08:24.560
MARISHA: 11 damage.

3288
02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:25.520
MATT: 11 points of damage.

3289
02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:26.730
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

3290
02:08:26.730 --> 02:08:28.200
MATT: Again, okay.

3291
02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.010
MARISHA: I'm just going to, I'm just (grunts).

3292
02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:32.550
I'm just going to like carve through him.

3293
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:34.001
MATT: 16?
MARISHA: Fuck!

3294
02:08:34.001 --> 02:08:37.100
MATT: Is it DC 16, just enough.

3295
02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:37.960
TRAVIS: That's it, right?

3296
02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:40.100
MARISHA: My ki save is 15.

3297
02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:41.630
MATT: Oh, got you, so a little bit above it.

3298
02:08:41.630 --> 02:08:44.720
MARISHA: Right, yeah, yeah, it's still 15.

3299
02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:50.500
God, we're so close.

3300
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:55.550
LAURA: Are we?
(laughter)

3301
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:58.050
MARISHA: Flurry of Beaus!
SAM: Oh, branding!

3302
02:08:58.050 --> 02:09:00.640
MATT: Okay, how many more ki points do you have after--

3303
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:02.480
MARISHA: Three!
MATT: Three more? Nice.

3304
02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:04.170
All right, so go ahead and roll for your next two attacks.

3305
02:09:04.170 --> 02:09:05.800
MARISHA: Because we rested, so I got them back.

3306
02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:07.670
MATT: That's true.
MARISHA: Pop pop.

3307
02:09:07.670 --> 02:09:09.500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that was--

3308
02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.540
MATT: You do have advantage on these, remember.

3309
02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:13.560
MARISHA: 26.
MATT: 26 hits.

3310
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:16.410
MARISHA: Another 11.
MATT: All righty.

3311
02:09:16.410 --> 02:09:17.243
MARISHA: Last one.

3312
02:09:17.243 --> 02:09:18.380
LAURA: Were you trying to Stunning Strike him again?

3313
02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:20.490
MARISHA: 25. No.
MATT: 25 hits.

3314
02:09:24.110 --> 02:09:25.050
MARISHA: Eight damage.

3315
02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:28.020
MATT: Eight damage, all right, all these impacts,

3316
02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:29.170
you can see the armor cracking more,

3317
02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:30.630
the stone work's starting to give,

3318
02:09:30.630 --> 02:09:32.540
and parts of the metal beneath are starting to bend.

3319
02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.190
You can see elements where its joints are starting

3320
02:09:34.190 --> 02:09:35.640
to grind into each other,

3321
02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:37.590
as his body's starting to regain its movements.

3322
02:09:37.590 --> 02:09:39.270
MARISHA: You know what, you know what, yeah, yeah.

3323
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:41.600
I'm going to spend one more ki point at the very end

3324
02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:45.435
of my Flurry of Beaus-- Flurry of Blows,

3325
02:09:45.435 --> 02:09:48.590
as I'm just hammering away, and I'm going to just try

3326
02:09:48.590 --> 02:09:51.550
and concentrate one last one, and try and aim

3327
02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:54.220
for a pocket, and Stunning Strike him again.

3328
02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:55.270
MATT: That's a 16.

3329
02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:57.593
MARISHA: Okay.

3330
02:09:57.593 --> 02:09:58.530
MATT: He's got a pretty high constitution,

3331
02:09:58.530 --> 02:10:00.280
you gathered.
MARISHA: I figured.

3332
02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:02.880
MATT: Rolling okay middle ground

3333
02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:03.720
and is still getting out of it, so--

3334
02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.380
LIAM: Yeah, it bought us some time, man.

3335
02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:07.410
MATT: You did, all right, that finishes your turn?

3336
02:10:07.410 --> 02:10:09.180
MARISHA: That finished my turn.
MATT: All right.

3337
02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:13.470
MARISHA: I will-- no, yep, yep, no.

3338
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:15.375
MATT: Its turn, it is no longer stunned.

3339
02:10:15.375 --> 02:10:16.807
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, that's fucking--

3340
02:10:16.807 --> 02:10:18.232
LAURA: That's what it feels like.

3341
02:10:18.232 --> 02:10:19.808
LIAM: I'm not sweating it.

3342
02:10:19.808 --> 02:10:22.775
I'm having fun.

3343
02:10:22.775 --> 02:10:25.670
MATT: It's going to.

3344
02:10:25.670 --> 02:10:27.880
Put the cone there to prevent any of those things

3345
02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:31.160
from firing at it. It's now also going

3346
02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:35.370
to turn towards you. No, I'm sorry, not you,

3347
02:10:35.370 --> 02:10:38.697
you're not there, Beauregard, and it's--

3348
02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.860
You know what, it's going to attempt to,

3349
02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:45.300
its fist, this side is going to punch towards Beauregard,

3350
02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:47.420
and its claw's going to go for your throat.

3351
02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:48.253
MARISHA: This is going to hurt.

3352
02:10:48.253 --> 02:10:51.037
MATT: So the fist goes towards you, Beauregard.

3353
02:10:53.370 --> 02:10:54.203
Natural 20.

3354
02:10:56.011 --> 02:10:57.260
SAM: That's going that hurt.
MARISHA: Ow.

3355
02:10:57.260 --> 02:10:58.720
SAM: Are you already down?

3356
02:10:59.950 --> 02:11:01.780
MARISHA: I'm down only by two points, I think.

3357
02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:04.190
LAURA: It could still knock you out.

3358
02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:05.270
I could totally knock you out.

3359
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:06.770
MARISHA: He totally could knock me out,

3360
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:08.030
because he did how many points?

3361
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:10.096
Yeah, because he does double damage.

3362
02:11:10.096 --> 02:11:12.100
MATT: 38 points of bludgeoning damage.

3363
02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:13.450
LAURA: Doubled, or is that with the double?

3364
02:11:13.450 --> 02:11:15.663
MATT: That's with the double.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

3365
02:11:15.663 --> 02:11:18.190
MATT: You get slammed into the wall,

3366
02:11:18.190 --> 02:11:20.570
and your vision swims, and you stumble back

3367
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:22.750
into the place you were as this pulls back.

3368
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:25.058
The other attack's going to go towards you, Jester.

3369
02:11:25.058 --> 02:11:25.909
LAURA: I'm looking at you like--

3370
02:11:25.909 --> 02:11:27.300
SAM: (vocalizes)

3371
02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:31.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, like holy fuck, you just got smashed.

3372
02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:33.615
MATT: 17 to hit.
LIAM: I can see it--

3373
02:11:33.615 --> 02:11:36.796
LAURA: Oh, he misses, he misses me!

3374
02:11:36.796 --> 02:11:39.420
Shit, okay, all right.

3375
02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:42.286
So as the claw reaches towards you,

3376
02:11:42.286 --> 02:11:43.294
you just duck out of the way,

3377
02:11:43.294 --> 02:11:45.494
and it clinks right above your head,

3378
02:11:45.494 --> 02:11:47.220
gliding off of your breastplate

3379
02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:48.490
as you turn the shoulder away.

3380
02:11:48.490 --> 02:11:49.870
LAURA: Like imagine slow motion and Beau,

3381
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:52.012
it's just you and me, just--
MARISHA: Ah! Yeah!

3382
02:11:52.012 --> 02:11:55.780
(laughter)

3383
02:11:55.780 --> 02:12:00.430
I see that, and I see her, and I'm like: No! As you duck,

3384
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:03.090
and then I'm going to, a little dazed, just go--

3385
02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:08.820
with Sentinel.
MATT: Oh, yeah.

3386
02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.330
MARISHA: He attacked Jester, so.

3387
02:12:10.330 --> 02:12:11.930
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

3388
02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:14.750
MARISHA: Fucking.
LIAM: A bloody mess.

3389
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:15.980
MARISHA: Oh, he's not stunned anymore?

3390
02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:16.813
MATT: No.

3391
02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:18.930
Though you do have a pincer attack,

3392
02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:20.180
technically with Jester.

3393
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:24.366
MARISHA: 22.
MATT: 22, that hits.

3394
02:12:24.366 --> 02:12:25.199
MARISHA: 11 points.

3395
02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:26.918
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty.

3396
02:12:28.590 --> 02:12:30.210
All right, that ends--

3397
02:12:30.210 --> 02:12:32.410
MARISHA: And he cannot move.
MATT: Correct.

3398
02:12:32.410 --> 02:12:34.060
LAURA: Wait, I might, wait--

3399
02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:35.270
MATT: He is going to make a save real fast

3400
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:38.370
to see if he can resist the frost effect that was on him.

3401
02:12:38.370 --> 02:12:42.070
And he succeeds. The frost drifts off of him--

3402
02:12:42.070 --> 02:12:44.060
LAURA: But he did a melee attack against me.

3403
02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:44.960
MATT: He did.

3404
02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.060
LAURA: So I think as my reaction--

3405
02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:49.440
TRAVIS: Hellish.
LAURA: I get to do Hellish Rebuke.

3406
02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:51.660
MATT: You do.
SAM: Hellish Rebuke.

3407
02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:54.190
MATT: Did it hit you, or does it attack you?

3408
02:12:54.190 --> 02:12:55.610
LAURA: A creature did damaged to you.

3409
02:12:55.610 --> 02:12:57.030
MATT: Yeah, it didn't damage you, unfortunately.

3410
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:58.910
SAM and LAURA: No rebuke.

3411
02:12:58.910 --> 02:13:01.149
MATT: Unfortunately, trust me.
LAURA: Rebukeless.

3412
02:13:01.149 --> 02:13:03.249
Oh yeah. I'm pretty low.

3413
02:13:03.249 --> 02:13:06.570
That would have sucked.
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

3414
02:13:06.570 --> 02:13:11.208
TRAVIS: I'm going to pull out a little eldritch fingers,

3415
02:13:11.208 --> 02:13:12.860
and do nothing.
MATT: Okay.

3416
02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:15.540
LAURA: What?
TRAVIS: There's a cone.

3417
02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:17.870
SAM: Hold your attack?
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

3418
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:19.750
I'll hold Eldritch Blast--

3419
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:22.185
MATT: So as you put your hands up, you're like (whirring).

3420
02:13:22.185 --> 02:13:24.420
(laughter)

3421
02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:25.500
Clutching the sword in one hand--

3422
02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:27.480
TRAVIS: If I see an opening.
MATT: You got it. All right.

3423
02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:28.350
TRAVIS: The cone move.
MATT: All right.

3424
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:31.080
So you're holding your Eldritch Blast, Jester, you're up.

3425
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:33.970
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Are you close to dead?

3426
02:13:33.970 --> 02:13:37.380
LAURA: I am, I mean, kind of, but I want

3427
02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:41.320
to try to help other people before this.

3428
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:45.940
So I'm going to cast a Command on it,

3429
02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:47.800
now that its ears are--
MATT: Okay.

3430
02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:49.669
And what's your Command?

3431
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:52.780
LAURA: Off!

3432
02:13:54.250 --> 02:13:58.119
MATT: That's cocked, no, it's a fail.

3433
02:13:58.119 --> 02:14:01.244
(cheering)

3434
02:14:01.244 --> 02:14:04.169
Got a lot of good resistances, except for the wisdom.

3435
02:14:04.169 --> 02:14:05.852
TRAVIS: It's great, it's great.

3436
02:14:05.852 --> 02:14:07.410
MATT: (powering down)

3437
02:14:07.410 --> 02:14:09.390
(cheering)

3438
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:11.057
MARISHA: Or Eldritch Blast.
TRAVIS: (firing)

3439
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:15.815
MATT: Go for it, go for it.

3440
02:14:15.815 --> 02:14:18.103
TRAVIS: That one misses, that's 24.
MATT: 24?

3441
02:14:19.090 --> 02:14:20.110
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: That hits.

3442
02:14:20.970 --> 02:14:23.710
TRAVIS: 15 points of force damage.
MATT: Nice.

3443
02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.720
As the rune is flickering, that finishes your held action,

3444
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:32.090
that's your action.
LAURA: Oh, for my bonus action,

3445
02:14:32.090 --> 02:14:33.741
I'm going to hit it with my Spiritual Weapon.

3446
02:14:33.741 --> 02:14:36.920
MATT: Roll for an attack.

3447
02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.380
LAURA: That is a 20.

3448
02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:40.240
MATT: 20 hits, that just hits.

3449
02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:44.984
LAURA: 10 points.
MATT: 10 points damage.

3450
02:14:44.984 --> 02:14:46.740
After the blast in the front of its chest,

3451
02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:49.250
you can see most of the stone armor has broken away,

3452
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:50.990
and now it's just the metallic,

3453
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:53.310
iron adamantine pieces beneath.

3454
02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:56.410
So now it's like-- you know when

3455
02:14:56.410 --> 02:15:00.333
in Avengers 2, when you see the broken Iron Man armor

3456
02:15:00.333 --> 02:15:02.940
that Ultron's taken over, it's like that version

3457
02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:04.540
of this golem now, where all the stone has fallen away,

3458
02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:05.850
and you can see all the under parts

3459
02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:07.800
of the metal sparking together.

3460
02:15:08.962 --> 02:15:10.690
That brings us to Caleb's turn.

3461
02:15:10.690 --> 02:15:12.590
LIAM: So yeah, the claw just raises up

3462
02:15:12.590 --> 02:15:15.370
and slashes down onto its back.

3463
02:15:15.370 --> 02:15:16.203
MATT: You got it.

3464
02:15:16.203 --> 02:15:18.000
LIAM: Does it have advantage because he's shut down, or--?

3465
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.250
MATT: Technically he doesn't start until the next round.

3466
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:20.230
Like the rune's flickering off,

3467
02:15:20.230 --> 02:15:22.590
but he's not shut down until his next turn.

3468
02:15:22.590 --> 02:15:24.070
LIAM: Oh, well, then I probably just missed, then,

3469
02:15:24.070 --> 02:15:26.540
because that is just 12.
MATT: 12, nope.

3470
02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:28.210
LIAM: Doesn't work.
MATT: It streaks across the back

3471
02:15:28.210 --> 02:15:30.320
of the armor, but doesn't leave any impact,

3472
02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:31.270
a couple of marks.

3473
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:33.240
LIAM: That's my bonus action, I see that, say <i>scheisse</i>!

3474
02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:36.170
then I go and grab the pearl box behind me--

3475
02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:38.740
MATT: Okay, you grab it. It's in your grasp.

3476
02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:40.240
All right, Caduceus?

3477
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:42.760
TALIESIN: I've got a clear shot with the cold

3478
02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:44.350
without hitting anybody?
MATT: Seems to be.

3479
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:46.079
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: Yeah. Roll an intelligence check for me.

3480
02:15:46.079 --> 02:15:47.154
TALIESIN: Okay.

3481
02:15:47.154 --> 02:15:49.345
LAURA: (laughing) Oh my god.
SAM: And three.

3482
02:15:49.345 --> 02:15:51.128
TALIESIN: Nine.
MATT: Nine.

3483
02:15:51.128 --> 02:15:52.525
LIAM: Oh!

3484
02:15:52.525 --> 02:15:54.260
LIAM: All right, all right.
LIAM: Goddamn it.

3485
02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:57.270
MATT: But, what are you doing?
TALIESIN: Cold button again.

3486
02:15:57.270 --> 02:16:00.028
MATT: The middle one?
(laughter)

3487
02:16:00.028 --> 02:16:02.030
The same sphere of cold blasts forward.

3488
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:04.105
Go ahead and--
LAURA: If you just hit this one,

3489
02:16:04.105 --> 02:16:06.460
you'll be dead instantly.
TRAVIS: There's a deactivate--

3490
02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:09.178
TALIESIN: There is a deactivate button.

3491
02:16:09.178 --> 02:16:10.670
MATT: Go for it.
TALIESIN: How many?

3492
02:16:10.670 --> 02:16:12.840
MATT: This is 4d10.
TALIESIN: 4d10.

3493
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:17.380
That's not bad-- yeah, that is bad.

3494
02:16:18.879 --> 02:16:19.712
20 points.
MATT: 20 points?

3495
02:16:19.712 --> 02:16:21.929
LAURA: That's not bad, that's half.
TALIESIN: That's not bad.

3496
02:16:21.929 --> 02:16:23.450
MATT: All right, it impacts, and you can see,

3497
02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:25.250
it expands into this sphere of cold.

3498
02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.560
I need both Beauregard and Jester

3499
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.270
to make constitution saves, please.

3500
02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:31.380
LAURA: What, again, from the cold one?

3501
02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:35.140
I thought we only, that only--
TALIESIN: But that was--

3502
02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:36.181
MARISHA: Did we have to do that before?

3503
02:16:36.181 --> 02:16:39.080
TALIESIN: It didn't do that before.
MATT: Yeah, it should have.

3504
02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.210
(groaning)
TALIESIN: Oh!

3505
02:16:41.210 --> 02:16:42.270
Well, if I'd known that, I would have--

3506
02:16:42.270 --> 02:16:43.830
MATT: Well, it would have happened last round, anyway, so.

3507
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:45.200
LAURA: What is this, a constitution?

3508
02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:48.250
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: That's poop for me.

3509
02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:51.200
MATT: It does make it save, so it takes half damage.
What'd you roll for damage?

3510
02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.150
TALIESIN: 20.
MATT: 20, so it takes 10.

3511
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.983
LAURA: 12.

3512
02:16:53.983 --> 02:16:55.720
MATT: 12, take 20 points of cold damage.

3513
02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:58.345
MARISHA: 10.
MATT: 10, 20 points of cold damage.

3514
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.070
TALIESIN: No more cold damage apparently, okay.

3515
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:03.930
TRAVIS: No more shooting the gun.

3516
02:17:03.930 --> 02:17:06.030
TALIESIN: We're going to knock that off.

3517
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:07.250
SAM: That's what I was going to do, though.

3518
02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:09.650
TALIESIN: That's why I'm yelling that
at you with my bonus action.

3519
02:17:09.650 --> 02:17:11.475
MATT: All right, Caduceus, your turn's up. Nott, you're up.

3520
02:17:11.475 --> 02:17:13.125
LAURA: Maybe your intelligence will help.

3521
02:17:13.125 --> 02:17:15.850
SAM: Can I check for--
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

3522
02:17:15.850 --> 02:17:17.800
SAM: Okay, 15.
MATT: 15?

3523
02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:19.474
LAURA: Oh, thank god!

3524
02:17:19.474 --> 02:17:21.215
SAM: Oh my god, oh my god!

3525
02:17:21.215 --> 02:17:23.360
This is a fucking novel!

3526
02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.000
Arcane cannon, you got acid, you got fire,

3527
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.590
you got frost, you got lightning, you got poison.

3528
02:17:28.590 --> 02:17:31.210
What do we know about it?
MARISHA: We know--

3529
02:17:31.210 --> 02:17:33.090
TRAVIS: Acid, lightning, cold would work.

3530
02:17:33.090 --> 02:17:34.890
MARISHA: And it's immune to poison, and it's immune

3531
02:17:34.890 --> 02:17:38.540
to psychic, and heat it absorbs.

3532
02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:40.970
LAURA: Anything-- it's all area of effect.

3533
02:17:40.970 --> 02:17:41.970
SAM: Each creature--

3534
02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:44.930
MATT: Acid is actually in a line.

3535
02:17:44.930 --> 02:17:46.340
LAURA: Oh, acid is a line?

3536
02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:48.340
MATT: 300 foot line.
LAURA: Oh, great!

3537
02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:50.400
So it doesn't do an area of effect?

3538
02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:51.370
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Oh.

3539
02:17:51.370 --> 02:17:52.800
SAM: And it's okay with that-- I mean,

3540
02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:54.790
it's resistant to acid, or--?
LAURA: No, it's not.

3541
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:57.520
So yeah, acid, dissolve it.
SAM: I don't--

3542
02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:00.294
it doesn't say what color it is.

3543
02:18:00.294 --> 02:18:02.840
MATT: Well, you know looking at that,
you don't have to worry about the color now,

3544
02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:04.590
you know exactly what each switch does.

3545
02:18:04.590 --> 02:18:07.590
SAM: I have a feeling that acid is good.

3546
02:18:07.590 --> 02:18:08.423
TALIESIN: Oh, no!

3547
02:18:08.423 --> 02:18:10.580
MATT: All right, so you pull the far left lever,

3548
02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:13.120
you see the sigils glow that same deep green color,

3549
02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:14.540
and the front as it swirls,

3550
02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:18.580
and then fires a five foot stream of condensed acid

3551
02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:21.340
that sprays down the center of it like,

3552
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:23.920
which does hit your cat hand.

3553
02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:25.050
Which I need you to go ahead

3554
02:18:25.050 --> 02:18:29.310
and make a dexterity saving throw, as does the golem.

3555
02:18:29.310 --> 02:18:31.618
Which fails, as it's not very dexterous.

3556
02:18:31.618 --> 02:18:33.935
SAM: Give me some tens.
LAURA: And it's also shut down.

3557
02:18:33.935 --> 02:18:36.700
LIAM: 16 for Cat's Ire.
MATT: So 4d10.

3558
02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.180
What was it, 16?
LIAM: 16.

3559
02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:40.280
MATT: 16, that is a success.
SAM: Oh!

3560
02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:43.170
LAURA: That's the worst it could ever be.

3561
02:18:43.170 --> 02:18:45.130
SAM: 11 points.

3562
02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:47.950
MATT: 11 points of acid damage to the claw and the golem.

3563
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:49.325
LIAM: How much was it?
MATT: 11.

3564
02:18:49.325 --> 02:18:50.840
LIAM: 11.
SAM: The worst.

3565
02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:52.365
MATT: However--

3566
02:18:53.577 --> 02:18:55.270
LIAM: Does the acid cling--

3567
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:56.930
MATT: At the start of each of its turns,

3568
02:18:56.930 --> 02:18:59.040
it continues to dissolve it for 2d10 every turn.

3569
02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:00.320
SAM: Okay, okay.
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

3570
02:19:01.195 --> 02:19:02.430
TRAVIS: That's the button.
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.

3571
02:19:02.430 --> 02:19:04.041
MATT: Marking--
TRAVIS: That's the one.

3572
02:19:04.041 --> 02:19:07.358
MARISHA: That he's got acid on him.
TALIESIN: Just no one get in the way.

3573
02:19:07.358 --> 02:19:09.637
MATT: Acid on the claws, acid on the guy.
LAURA: Really nasty.

3574
02:19:09.637 --> 02:19:12.950
MATT: Exactly, all righty, that finishes your turn, Nott?

3575
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:14.680
SAM: I think so.
MATT: Beauregard, you're up.

3576
02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:17.230
SAM: I'm going to drink my drink for the rest of the turn.

3577
02:19:17.230 --> 02:19:18.090
MATT: You got it.

3578
02:19:18.090 --> 02:19:20.470
SAM: And just spin around, woo,

3579
02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:22.930
like does this thing go in 360, or no?

3580
02:19:22.930 --> 02:19:24.800
MATT: No, it (imitates clanking) to one side.

3581
02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.824
SAM: Oh, I'll just go back and forth.

3582
02:19:26.824 --> 02:19:28.075
(laughter)

3583
02:19:28.075 --> 02:19:30.130
MATT: All right.
(laughter)

3584
02:19:30.130 --> 02:19:33.980
MARISHA: I'm going to slip to behind him,

3585
02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:37.850
where I'm not going to plant my fists in acid,

3586
02:19:37.850 --> 02:19:40.790
and pop, pop.
MATT: Go for it.

3587
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:44.323
MARISHA: Two robo kidney shots.

3588
02:19:44.323 --> 02:19:45.664
God, that's garbage,

3589
02:19:45.664 --> 02:19:49.570
both of them, 13 and 20.
LIAM: 20 hits.

3590
02:19:49.570 --> 02:19:51.090
MATT: 20 does hit, yes.

3591
02:19:51.090 --> 02:19:55.701
MARISHA: First one misses. Also garbage, seven.

3592
02:19:55.701 --> 02:19:58.530
MATT: Seven, all right, so the second hit,

3593
02:19:58.530 --> 02:20:00.680
your action makes an impact.

3594
02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:02.530
You barely pull away before the acid drips

3595
02:20:02.530 --> 02:20:04.950
onto your hand. You still have your bonus action.

3596
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:07.510
MARISHA: It's broken down for one more round, right?

3597
02:20:08.427 --> 02:20:10.697
MATT: It is shut off, yes.
MARISHA: It's shut off?

3598
02:20:12.652 --> 02:20:15.935
I'm going to spend another ki point to do Flurry of Blows.

3599
02:20:15.935 --> 02:20:18.293
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: I just really want to get this thing dead.

3600
02:20:18.293 --> 02:20:21.135
I think it's the best--
TRAVIS: Is this your last one?

3601
02:20:21.135 --> 02:20:24.535
You got one more after this.
MARISHA: I've got one more after this.

3602
02:20:24.535 --> 02:20:27.735
MATT: Two more attacks.
MARISHA: Two more attacks.

3603
02:20:27.735 --> 02:20:31.330
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
MARISHA: A natural 20.

3604
02:20:31.330 --> 02:20:34.140
MATT: Nice.
MARISHA: And an 18 for a 28.

3605
02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:35.920
MATT: All right, both hit, so roll for the regular attack,

3606
02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:38.650
and then the critical--
MARISHA: Regular.

3607
02:20:38.650 --> 02:20:42.870
Regular, okay, it's 12 damage.

3608
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:45.170
I wish that would have been--

3609
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.945
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3610
02:20:46.945 --> 02:20:50.530
Eight plus another six--
LAURA: 14?

3611
02:20:50.530 --> 02:20:53.120
MARISHA: Eight plus six is 14.
MATT: 14, all right.

3612
02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:54.210
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Is that double?

3613
02:20:54.210 --> 02:20:57.080
LIAM: No, that was the first attack, Matt said.

3614
02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.990
MATT: No, no, no, it was you rolled four on the dice,

3615
02:20:58.990 --> 02:21:00.303
the dice became eight,

3616
02:21:00.303 --> 02:21:02.430
and then plus--
LAURA: Oh, oh, got it.

3617
02:21:02.430 --> 02:21:04.820
MATT: So they're good on that, okay, so as you pummel

3618
02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:06.400
into it, you reach and you tear out some more

3619
02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:08.220
of the cabling on the inside

3620
02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:10.970
that's holding it together, it's looking really rough.

3621
02:21:10.970 --> 02:21:14.010
Really, really, really bad. That finish your turn, Beau?

3622
02:21:14.010 --> 02:21:15.090
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

3623
02:21:15.090 --> 02:21:16.578
Now it's the golem's turn, at the top of its turn,

3624
02:21:16.578 --> 02:21:19.020
it takes 2d10 damage, go ahead and roll the damage

3625
02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:20.892
for me, Sam?
SAM: I will.

3626
02:21:20.892 --> 02:21:22.410
LAURA: Okay.

3627
02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:25.090
SAM: Seven points.
MATT: Seven points of acid.

3628
02:21:25.090 --> 02:21:28.057
You can see the metal starting to pock and burn.

3629
02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:32.340
It's looking really bad. That brings us

3630
02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:34.820
to the golem. It shuts down from the Command,

3631
02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:37.330
Fjord, you're up.
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast.

3632
02:21:37.330 --> 02:21:40.180
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: Kill it, kill it!

3633
02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:42.250
TRAVIS: 24, and the other one misses.

3634
02:21:42.250 --> 02:21:44.150
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

3635
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:47.444
SAM: Come on, Fjordy.
TRAVIS: 13 points of force damage.

3636
02:21:47.444 --> 02:21:48.827
MATT: It's looking real hurt.

3637
02:21:48.827 --> 02:21:50.112
MARISHA: Damn it!

3638
02:21:50.112 --> 02:21:52.830
MATT: All right, is that your turn, Fjord?
All right, Jester, you're up.

3639
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:56.120
LAURA: Oh, okay, bonus action. I'm
going to Spiritual Weapon.

3640
02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:59.190
MATT: Roll for an attack.

3641
02:22:00.050 --> 02:22:04.480
LAURA: Natural one, cool.
MATT: Oof, whiffs.

3642
02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:07.960
LAURA: Great, and then I'm going to--
TRAVIS: Right there.

3643
02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.451
LAURA: Jesus.
MARISHA: I know, I know.

3644
02:22:10.451 --> 02:22:14.250
LAURA: Oh, man, second level, Inflict Wounds.

3645
02:22:14.250 --> 02:22:16.470
I'm going to reach up and aim for that area

3646
02:22:16.470 --> 02:22:18.710
that Beau's been attacking, I'm just
going to stick my hand in.

3647
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:21.990
MATT: Yeah, as Beau pulls the cables out
and you can see sparks, you're like, "Ah"

3648
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:23.630
and you reach into grab it, and

3649
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:25.150
immediately you feel your hand go numb.

3650
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:27.160
Go ahead and roll for the attack.

3651
02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:28.468
LIAM: Oh, geez.

3652
02:22:29.477 --> 02:22:31.673
LAURA: It's not going to hit, it's not going to hit.

3653
02:22:31.673 --> 02:22:34.330
SAM: Nine?
LAURA: No, that's a 13.

3654
02:22:34.330 --> 02:22:35.670
MATT: Yeah, you try and reach up, and immediately,

3655
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:37.890
it shocks your hand, you're like, (hisses) and pull back.

3656
02:22:37.890 --> 02:22:40.598
It hurt too much--
LAURA: That hurt me!

3657
02:22:41.673 --> 02:22:42.506
MATT: Anything else on your turn?

3658
02:22:42.506 --> 02:22:44.590
LAURA: No, it is my bonus and my attack,

3659
02:22:44.590 --> 02:22:45.760
that's all I can do.

3660
02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:48.430
MATT: Okay, Caleb, top of your turn, go ahead--
LIAM: Cat's Ire.

3661
02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:50.180
MATT: Hmm?
LIAM: Cat's Ire.

3662
02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:52.360
MATT: Well, it takes 2d10 points of acid damage.

3663
02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:53.300
LIAM: Oh, so it's going to go.

3664
02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:54.710
Go ahead and roll for it.
SAM: Everybody's turn?

3665
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:57.570
MATT: Top of the Caleb's turn.
LIAM: I thought it was at the end.

3666
02:22:57.570 --> 02:22:58.990
SAM: This is on you.
LAURA: Oh, that's your thing.

3667
02:22:58.990 --> 02:23:01.770
Got it, got it.
LIAM: It's gone, it's gone.

3668
02:23:01.770 --> 02:23:02.603
SAM: 13.

3669
02:23:02.603 --> 02:23:04.903
LIAM: Cat's Ire's gone.
MATT: Yeah. It melts the hand.

3670
02:23:08.202 --> 02:23:10.170
LAURA: Do you have anything other than fire?

3671
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:13.340
LIAM: High level stuff, and I don't know what's left

3672
02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:15.400
in this place.
SAM: What lies ahead.

3673
02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:17.992
TRAVIS: We're going to have to rest.
LIAM: They look like they've got it.

3674
02:23:17.992 --> 02:23:20.110
LAURA: Like whoa.

3675
02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:22.896
LAURA: This is a good place to rest, though.
MARISHA: Yeah, it is. It's pretty--

3676
02:23:22.896 --> 02:23:25.430
LIAM: Yeah, I see Beauregard beating
the shit out of this thing,

3677
02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:28.428
so I go and grab that long box,
and just trust that they've got it.

3678
02:23:28.428 --> 02:23:29.800
MATT: You got it, so you go ahead and move over

3679
02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:33.478
and grab the box. You're over on this side there.

3680
02:23:33.478 --> 02:23:37.777
Pull it out from the corner space there.
All right, Caduceus, you're up.

3681
02:23:37.777 --> 02:23:39.594
SAM: The acid one!
LAURA: Acid!

3682
02:23:39.594 --> 02:23:40.830
TALIESIN: This one?
SAM: Yeah!

3683
02:23:40.830 --> 02:23:43.288
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

3684
02:23:44.420 --> 02:23:46.389
TRAVIS: Come on, six.
TALIESIN: Six.

3685
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:49.689
TRAVIS: What the fuck!
(clamoring and laughter)

3686
02:23:49.689 --> 02:23:51.660
MATT: He says acid, you don't know what to hit.

3687
02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:53.820
What do you want to touch?
SAM: Do acid with me.

3688
02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:56.170
TALIESIN: Which one is the acid one, I don't know,

3689
02:23:56.170 --> 02:23:57.530
I don't know which one's the acid--

3690
02:23:57.530 --> 02:23:59.230
MATT: Which lever do you pull?

3691
02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:01.660
TALIESIN: If I don't know which one to
pull, I'm not going to--

3692
02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:03.293
MATT: There's the dark green, there's the red,

3693
02:24:03.293 --> 02:24:04.601
there's the light blue, there's the intense blue,

3694
02:24:04.601 --> 02:24:05.450
and there's the pale green.

3695
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:06.670
TALIESIN: I'm not going to push any of them.

3696
02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:09.380
I'm just going to stare, like,
I don't know what to do, this is all--

3697
02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:11.120
SAM: Hit something!

3698
02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:13.310
TALIESIN: No, I'm--
LAURA: Pale green, pale green.

3699
02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:17.130
TALIESIN: I'm actually-- uh.

3700
02:24:17.130 --> 02:24:18.560
MATT: What are you doing, Caduceus? Are you holding off?

3701
02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:19.960
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold off.

3702
02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:22.010
I don't like any of this, no.

3703
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:25.380
MATT: Okay, all right, got it, so you hold off

3704
02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:27.788
on your turn. Nott, you're up.

3705
02:24:27.788 --> 02:24:29.950
SAM: Acid!
(laughter)

3706
02:24:29.950 --> 02:24:32.163
Which, by the way, is the what color?

3707
02:24:32.163 --> 02:24:33.850
TRAVIS: Pale green.
SAM: Pale green?

3708
02:24:33.850 --> 02:24:35.500
MATT: Dark green.
SAM: Dark green!

3709
02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:37.090
TALIESIN: That would have gone real well, wouldn't it?

3710
02:24:37.090 --> 02:24:38.804
MATT: That would have gone real bad.

3711
02:24:38.804 --> 02:24:40.970
TALIESIN: The smart people would-- you know.
Sometimes the best thing

3712
02:24:40.970 --> 02:24:43.112
is just to sit and stare for a while.

3713
02:24:43.112 --> 02:24:44.580
Thank you.
TRAVIS: Just a six.

3714
02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:46.852
MATT: Yeah.
(laughter)

3715
02:24:46.852 --> 02:24:50.270
SAM: I will hit this button just with my pinky. Boop!

3716
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:52.987
MATT: All right.
(laughter)

3717
02:24:52.987 --> 02:24:55.440
It sprays the line of acid down the entire chamber,

3718
02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:57.020
spraying the top of the ceiling, dripping

3719
02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:59.080
into the middle for a second. It strikes

3720
02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:02.695
into the golem. It's going to go ahead and make its save.

3721
02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:05.350
Doubles and natural fours, fail.

3722
02:25:05.350 --> 02:25:07.138
So go ahead and roll 4d10 points of acid damage.

3723
02:25:07.138 --> 02:25:08.480
TRAVIS: Come on, come on, come on, come on.

3724
02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:10.263
LIAM: Oh, big rolls.
SAM: Batter, batter.

3725
02:25:10.263 --> 02:25:11.890
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, that's good.

3726
02:25:11.890 --> 02:25:14.160
SAM: 26 points of damage.

3727
02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:16.490
MATT: How do you want to do this?
(cheering)

3728
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:20.547
SAM: Oh, boy, oh, boy.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

3729
02:25:22.610 --> 02:25:24.750
SAM: I'll sort of arc the acid

3730
02:25:24.750 --> 02:25:26.360
so it hits the ceiling a little bit,

3731
02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:29.510
and it drips down and melts it from above.

3732
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:31.580
MATT: As it sprays onto it and covers it

3733
02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:33.880
in the caustic solution, you see it

3734
02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:36.060
beginning to turn back on,

3735
02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:37.530
the front of its sigil beginning

3736
02:25:37.530 --> 02:25:39.240
to brighten up blue once more.

3737
02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:42.070
As it takes a step forward, you see its torso begin

3738
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:45.870
to bow inward, as its head sinks into its torso,

3739
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:48.000
the inside of its body losing its cohesion.

3740
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.100
It begins to just burn and sizzle and smoke,

3741
02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:53.290
caustic fume burning off of its body,

3742
02:25:53.290 --> 02:25:55.900
and with its secondary step, its whole upper

3743
02:25:55.900 --> 02:25:59.030
torso area folds on itself onto the ground,

3744
02:25:59.030 --> 02:26:01.090
and slowly begins to just melt into a pile.

3745
02:26:01.090 --> 02:26:04.710
LIAM: Except for the thumbs up.
(laughter)

3746
02:26:05.668 --> 02:26:08.310
SAM: Oh my god. And then I'll just go back

3747
02:26:08.310 --> 02:26:10.490
and forth a bunch of times.
(laughter)

3748
02:26:10.490 --> 02:26:12.610
LIAM: And Beau and Jester melt into the--

3749
02:26:12.610 --> 02:26:14.120
MATT: Yeah. And we'll go ahead

3750
02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:16.391
and take a break there.
(groaning)

3751
02:26:16.391 --> 02:26:18.400
At the end of that intense chase.

3752
02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:20.150
MARISHA: That was awesome.

3753
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:23.240
MATT: Man, creatively saving the fucking day.

3754
02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:24.360
SAM: Command.

3755
02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:26.548
TALIESIN: Why didn't you just say dark green, man?

3756
02:26:26.548 --> 02:26:27.690
(laughter)

3757
02:26:27.690 --> 02:26:29.520
MATT: All right, we'll come back here in a minute,

3758
02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:32.430
after a break. We do have our giveaway this week.

3759
02:26:32.430 --> 02:26:34.470
We unfortunately do not have it physically with us,

3760
02:26:34.470 --> 02:26:37.060
but from our friends at Wyrmwood,

3761
02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:38.530
we do have the Coffin Dice Vault,

3762
02:26:38.530 --> 02:26:41.130
featuring monster art by Crystal Sully.

3763
02:26:41.130 --> 02:26:42.920
TALIESIN: Coffin Dice Vault. They're hot.

3764
02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:44.720
MATT: It's available for two weeks only on the Kickstarter.

3765
02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:46.650
You can go to Wyrmwood's current Kickstarter

3766
02:26:46.650 --> 02:26:48.390
to see what it actually looks like,

3767
02:26:48.390 --> 02:26:52.105
but tonight's word is tower, T-O-W-E-R.

3768
02:26:52.105 --> 02:26:53.890
Put it in once, more than once, you'll be disqualified,

3769
02:26:53.890 --> 02:26:55.480
and once again, people in the US and Canada only,

3770
02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:57.280
excluding Quebec because of stupid laws.

3771
02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:59.160
But we'll have a winner shortly,

3772
02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:01.760
back here in the Twitch chat.
We'll see you guys in a few minutes.

3773
02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:03.751
TRAVIS: Amazing!

WILL: Hey, everyone, the
insanely talented Will Friedle here.

3792
02:27:56.480 --> 02:27:58.980
I'm excited to announce that
I have a new late night talk show coming

3793
02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:00.630
to the Critical Role YouTube channel

3794
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:03.180
on Wednesdays called Mini Primetime.

3795
02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:04.580
It's brought to you by the same creators

3796
02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:09.420
as that one show with the hippy kid
with the bracelets, whatever that is.

3797
02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:11.595
Anyway, my show, Mini Primetime,

3798
02:28:11.595 --> 02:28:14.490
is a mini painting show for beginners and veterans alike,

3799
02:28:14.490 --> 02:28:16.980
where this handsome face teaches the Critical Role cast how

3800
02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:18.880
to paint their own Mighty Nein minis.

3801
02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:20.950
We're going to be focusing on specific techniques,

3802
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:23.030
like fades, small detail work,

3803
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:24.380
and taking your mini to the next level

3804
02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:26.540
by adding to your base, so look for it soon

3805
02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:29.070
on Critical Role's YouTube.

3806
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:32.470
Critical Role, what is that, what is even a critical role?

3807
02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:34.061
Oh, that's right,

3808
02:28:34.061 --> 02:28:36.294
that was the show with Kash.

3809
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.791
(jazzy saxophone music)

3810
02:29:01.621 --> 02:29:06.479
(dramatic orchestral music)

3811
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:35.820
(slow guitar music)

3812
02:29:35.820 --> 02:29:40.650
TRAVIS: Our Father, we gather here as strangers,

3813
02:29:40.650 --> 02:29:45.650
brought together by gold, now bound by fate and fear.

3814
02:29:46.570 --> 02:29:51.550
We remain steadfast in our bodies and in our minds,

3815
02:29:51.550 --> 02:29:56.527
but this evil we face now meets us ill prepared.

3816
02:29:58.278 --> 02:30:01.453
For guidance, we ask you now,

3817
02:30:01.453 --> 02:30:04.561
for protection,

3818
02:30:04.561 --> 02:30:09.561
not just for our lives, but for our very souls.

3819
02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:11.707
Be our light

3820
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:15.260
as we enter the darkness.

3821
02:30:16.303 --> 02:30:19.303
(slow guitar music)

3822
02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:43.450
MARISHA: Oh, hello, Pub Draw enthusiasts,

3823
02:30:43.450 --> 02:30:45.120
Babs and I just wanted to let you know

3824
02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:48.630
that right now, at shop.critrole.com, you can pick

3825
02:30:48.630 --> 02:30:52.840
up this beautiful Follow Your Art Heart pencil case.

3826
02:30:52.840 --> 02:30:54.580
You can put your art supplies in it.

3827
02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:55.730
BABS: You can put makeup in it.

3828
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:57.630
MARISHA: Dice.
BABS: Anything you want.

3829
02:30:57.630 --> 02:31:00.100
MARISHA: You name it, it goes in this case.

3830
02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:01.360
BABS: Adorable case.

3831
02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.543
MARISHA: Follow your art heart.

3832
02:31:03.543 --> 02:31:04.376
BABS: Bye.

3833
02:31:04.376 --> 02:31:09.235
(slow electronic music)

3834
02:31:19.578 --> 02:31:24.503
(slow stylized country music)

3835
02:31:46.310 --> 02:31:48.700
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

3836
02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:50.930
TALIESIN: You've got to be truthful, I mean,

3837
02:31:50.930 --> 02:31:53.620
you've got to know how to do it.

3838
02:31:53.620 --> 02:31:56.390
If you're lying all the time, then what's the good of it?

3839
02:31:56.390 --> 02:31:58.240
You've got to save your mistruths for those moments

3840
02:31:58.240 --> 02:32:00.820
when it's just going to help make somebody a better person.

3841
02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:02.150
BRIAN: That's what I do.

3842
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:03.883
TALIESIN, MATT, and DANI: (skeptically) Yeah.

3843
02:32:03.883 --> 02:32:08.216
(laughter)

3844
02:32:08.216 --> 02:32:09.640
TALIESIN: We don't do this often enough, man.

3845
02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:11.958
MATT: I know!
BRIAN: All three of you.

3846
02:32:11.958 --> 02:32:13.302
MATT: It's amazing.
(laughter)

3847
02:32:13.302 --> 02:32:16.050
BRIAN: At the same time for the exact same duration.

3848
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:17.692
(laughter)

3849
02:32:17.692 --> 02:32:20.850
Oh my god.
(laughter)

3850
02:32:20.850 --> 02:32:24.810
I feel called out.
TALIESIN: Good, that's, yeah.

3851
02:32:24.810 --> 02:32:26.010
BRIAN: Good Lord.

3852
02:32:26.010 --> 02:32:27.868
So question for Matt.
MATT: Yes.

3853
02:32:27.868 --> 02:32:30.010
Up until now, references

3854
02:32:30.010 --> 02:32:32.030
to the first campaign have been little more

3855
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:35.350
than easter eggs. What made you decide now was the time

3856
02:32:35.350 --> 02:32:37.370
to introduce the first major character

3857
02:32:37.370 --> 02:32:39.150
from Campaign One into the story,

3858
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:42.740
and why did you specifically choose Allura?

3859
02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:44.180
MATT: It was less of a choice of like,

3860
02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:45.690
now's the time to introduce something,

3861
02:32:45.690 --> 02:32:48.210
and more figuring out the situation in the world,

3862
02:32:48.210 --> 02:32:52.280
where if they went to Yussa, the state they'd find him in,

3863
02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:56.630
and how they would be able to...

3864
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:58.420
to kind of really figure out the circumstances

3865
02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:00.533
they themselves have found themselves in,
and how to help him.

3866
02:33:00.533 --> 02:33:03.100
It could have been just finding notes, but that also--

3867
02:33:03.100 --> 02:33:04.950
knowing how careful a mage like him would have been

3868
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:08.580
to not leave behind a huge paper trail,

3869
02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:11.140
to things like this, it made more sense

3870
02:33:11.140 --> 02:33:12.470
that he would probably have to call an ally in.

3871
02:33:12.470 --> 02:33:13.680
And beginning to think about allies,

3872
02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:15.820
there aren't a lot of mages on this continent

3873
02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:17.800
that are unified, that aren't part

3874
02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:19.640
of the Cerberus Assembly.

3875
02:33:20.639 --> 02:33:22.440
And I was like, well, it'd be kind of fun

3876
02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:24.700
if he was at least allied somewhat

3877
02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:27.410
with the Arcana Pansophical, and then thinking

3878
02:33:27.410 --> 02:33:29.760
of that, I was like, I guess it'd be kind of fun

3879
02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.930
to have Allura in, especially with the party having kind of,

3880
02:33:33.930 --> 02:33:38.930
as intense as the past few sessions have been,

3881
02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:40.370
I thought it all made sense,

3882
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:42.800
and it would be a fun little moment

3883
02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:44.090
to kind of throw a little bit of

3884
02:33:44.090 --> 02:33:46.330
that old Campaign One charm at them, so.

3885
02:33:46.330 --> 02:33:48.800
BRIAN: That eyebrow is so disturbing to me, Matthew.

3886
02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:50.260
TALIESIN: When he does that? Yeah.

3887
02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:51.580
BRIAN: It's so disturbing.

3888
02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:53.722
MATT: It's fine.
BRIAN: Don't do it.

3889
02:33:53.722 --> 02:33:54.840
TALIESIN: I can't look at you.
BRIAN: Don't do it.

3890
02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:55.673
TALIESIN: Oh, God.

3891
02:33:55.673 --> 02:33:57.523
BRIAN: No, no, no, no, no.

3892
02:33:57.523 --> 02:34:00.653
Do it again? Ugh.

3893
02:34:00.653 --> 02:34:01.880
All right, we got it, we got it.

3894
02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:03.870
Hey, what role does Caduceus see himself playing

3895
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:06.220
in Fjord's new journey with the Wild Mother?

3896
02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:08.860
Wait, have we not had Taliesin on since that happened?

3897
02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:11.690
TALIESIN: No, I-- they've kind of had backlog,

3898
02:34:11.690 --> 02:34:13.040
so they kind of gave me a little break.

3899
02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:16.150
BRIAN: Does he view himself as a spiritual guide,

3900
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:18.050
a big brother, or merely an observer?

3901
02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:21.138
TALIESIN: Definitely there will be
a bit of a spiritual guide.

3902
02:34:21.138 --> 02:34:25.040
He's looking for moments to have some conversations

3903
02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:27.160
and then reward some behavior,

3904
02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:29.062
and kind of help him.

3905
02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:32.560
Right now, what he wants to talk to Fjord about,

3906
02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:34.603
which he hasn't yet, is the, like,

3907
02:34:34.603 --> 02:34:38.250
this isn't over, you've not been given a cure.

3908
02:34:38.250 --> 02:34:40.640
You've been given a way of walking forward

3909
02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:42.450
to deal with this thing that's going to be the rest

3910
02:34:42.450 --> 02:34:45.300
of your life now, so let's have a conversation

3911
02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:47.750
of what the rest of your life looks like,
now that you're doing this.

3912
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:49.060
BRIAN: Yep, I understand.

3913
02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:50.940
TALIESIN: And hopefully help you with that,

3914
02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:55.780
but yeah, that's definitely-- I think Caduceus suspects

3915
02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:58.140
that Fjord thinks he's fine now,

3916
02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:01.080
or at least is kind of hoping that it's fine now.

3917
02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:04.240
Having the-- no, no, no, no, no,

3918
02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:06.130
there's work to be done still.

3919
02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:08.467
MATT: Which is so different
from pretty much every other character

3920
02:35:08.467 --> 02:35:10.680
I've played with you as, and so--

3921
02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:11.960
TALIESIN: This is very off for me, yeah.

3922
02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:13.710
MATT: But it's been so fascinating and fun.

3923
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:16.070
It's a whole different energy, and you're--

3924
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:17.280
TALIESIN: I'm having fun.
MATT: You can tell.

3925
02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:19.620
You can tell that you're enjoying it thoroughly,

3926
02:35:19.620 --> 02:35:23.290
and every time you come in with a delightful quip

3927
02:35:23.290 --> 02:35:25.750
or a Caduceus reaction that is very much

3928
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:27.010
on par with his--

3929
02:35:27.010 --> 02:35:28.740
TALIESIN: This is my version of Grog, at this point.

3930
02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:29.573
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

3931
02:35:29.573 --> 02:35:30.406
BRIAN: Oh, interesting.

3932
02:35:30.406 --> 02:35:31.860
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a lot-- it's like-- yeah,

3933
02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:33.170
I can get away with a lot of things

3934
02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:35.010
I wouldn't normally be able to get away with.

3935
02:35:35.010 --> 02:35:36.430
MATT: It's pretty great, I'm a fan.

3936
02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:38.190
TALIESIN: I'm having fun.
BRIAN: I'm a fan too.

3937
02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:39.820
I know, it makes me almost happy Molly died,

3938
02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:40.890
because now we have--
TALIESIN: Wow.

3939
02:35:40.890 --> 02:35:42.480
No, wow, so dark.
DANI: Wow.

3940
02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:43.720
BRIAN: I said "almost."

3941
02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:44.553
TALIESIN: So dark.

3942
02:35:44.553 --> 02:35:46.369
BRIAN: It's Halloween, man,

3943
02:35:46.369 --> 02:35:47.935
nobody knows what's going to happen.

3944
02:35:47.935 --> 02:35:49.990
I also said "almost," you know?

3945
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:52.280
TALIESIN: Molly's going to come back and exact his revenge

3946
02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:54.390
on Halloween night.
MATT: There you go. On Brian W. Foster--

3947
02:35:54.390 --> 02:35:55.790
TALIESIN: Yeah, on Brian W. Foster.

3948
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:56.940
MATT: We're going to storm his bedroom--

3949
02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:59.650
TALIESIN: The ghost of three-- three D&amp;D characters.

3950
02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:01.280
BRIAN: Well, I'll keep my ears out in the middle

3951
02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:03.554
of the night for that distinguished accent.

3952
02:36:03.554 --> 02:36:06.430
(laughter)

3953
02:36:06.430 --> 02:36:07.921
TALIESIN: How long were you sitting on <i>that</i>,

3954
02:36:07.921 --> 02:36:09.471
because damn! Wow.

3955
02:36:09.471 --> 02:36:11.930
BRIAN: The last eight minutes of total serious conversation.

3956
02:36:11.930 --> 02:36:13.060
TALIESIN: That's so solid.

3957
02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:15.390
BRIAN: Matt?
MATT: Yes?

3958
02:36:15.390 --> 02:36:18.490
BRIAN: Oh, no, Dani.
DANI: I know. (laughs)

3959
02:36:18.490 --> 02:36:19.801
BRIAN: Dani?
DANI: I know.

3960
02:36:19.801 --> 02:36:21.759
BRIAN: Okay, I read just the question,

3961
02:36:21.759 --> 02:36:25.130
I didn't read the--
DANI: The name?

3962
02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:27.583
BRIAN: How do we transition to this?
TALIESIN: You can't.

3963
02:36:27.583 --> 02:36:28.749
DANI: I mean--
BRIAN: Okay, Matt.

3964
02:36:28.749 --> 02:36:30.745
DANI: There's no ability.

3965
02:36:30.745 --> 02:36:33.980
Matt, and I promise you, this is not one

3966
02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:35.750
of my other internet accounts.

3967
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:39.410
We have a question from CalebsFamilyBBQ.

3968
02:36:39.410 --> 02:36:42.126
TALIESIN: Ohhh.

3969
02:36:42.126 --> 02:36:44.461
(laughter)

3970
02:36:44.461 --> 02:36:46.510
BRIAN: If I feel bad,

3971
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:48.960
if I feel bad,

3972
02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:52.190
something's wrong.
DANI: I'm sorry!

3973
02:36:52.190 --> 02:36:55.625
TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

3974
02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:59.123
BOTH: Well, hell--

3975
02:36:59.123 --> 02:37:01.223
(both screaming)

3976
02:37:01.223 --> 02:37:03.150
TRAVIS: What the fuck, what the fuck?

3977
02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:07.430
TALIESIN: Welcome to Yee-Haw Spooky Ranch.

3978
02:37:07.430 --> 02:37:09.650
BRIAN: Yee-Haw Spooky Ranch, there's no way,

3979
02:37:09.650 --> 02:37:12.430
we were just in Jungle Ranch.

3980
02:37:12.430 --> 02:37:15.940
TALIESIN: A friend of yours left a message, where is it?

3981
02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:18.748
Ah, yes, hold-- (grunts)

3982
02:37:18.748 --> 02:37:21.032
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.
BRIAN: Oh, it looks like a message.

3983
02:37:21.032 --> 02:37:23.610
TRAVIS: The dexterity on this fucking thing.
BRIAN: Wow.

3984
02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:27.380
TALIESIN: "Dear cardboard face and chosen one.

3985
02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:29.100
"If you are receiving this message,

3986
02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:33.020
"it means that the tome of realmportation was successful."

3987
02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:35.360
BRIAN: Wait, you don't think it's--

3988
02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:37.050
you don't think it's Bast'Alar, do you?

3989
02:37:37.050 --> 02:37:40.960
Do you think he knows him--
TALIESIN: Did you say Bast'Alar?

3990
02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:41.793
TRAVIS: Well--

3991
02:37:41.793 --> 02:37:45.084
TALIESIN: Now, there's a name I
haven't heard in a long time.

3992
02:37:45.084 --> 02:37:48.009
TRAVIS: What the fuck?
BRIAN: What, you know Bast'Alar?

3993
02:37:48.009 --> 02:37:49.767
TALIESIN: Ha! Know him?

3994
02:37:49.767 --> 02:37:53.570
Well, not by that stupid moniker he uses now.

3995
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:57.130
I knew him ages ago, a simpler time,

3996
02:37:57.130 --> 02:38:00.480
when he was known as Mitten McFlufflyfloof.

3997
02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:02.410
BRIAN: You're telling me that creature's name was

3998
02:38:02.410 --> 02:38:04.960
once Mittens McFluffyfloof?

3999
02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:06.785
TALIESIN: Are you really surprised?

4000
02:38:06.785 --> 02:38:10.660
He hasn't always been the ascended one or whatever.

4001
02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:12.120
BRIAN: What, ascended one, how do you know him--

4002
02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:13.403
TALIESIN: A long time ago.

4003
02:38:13.403 --> 02:38:14.895
TRAVIS: Oh God.
BRIAN: The fuck?

4004
02:38:14.895 --> 02:38:16.330
TALIESIN: Before he rose to power--
TRAVIS: He's monologuing.

4005
02:38:16.330 --> 02:38:19.800
TALIESIN: We were just stray kittens living on the streets

4006
02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:21.610
of Neo Game Land.
TRAVIS: Fucking where?

4007
02:38:21.610 --> 02:38:24.450
TALIESIN: When you live on the streets in a place like that,

4008
02:38:24.450 --> 02:38:27.270
you learn quickly that you need companionship

4009
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:28.740
to survive.
TRAVIS: Oh, they were lovers.

4010
02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.290
TALIESIN: We hunted together, ate together,

4011
02:38:31.290 --> 02:38:33.480
and kept each other warm on cold nights.

4012
02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:34.789
TRAVIS: They were fucking.

4013
02:38:34.789 --> 02:38:37.147
TALIESIN: I always accepted my fate of being abandoned

4014
02:38:37.147 --> 02:38:41.447
on the streets, but he could never
come to terms with it.

4015
02:38:41.447 --> 02:38:43.780
That's a story for another time,

4016
02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:47.210
swamp cooler breath. (laughs)

4017
02:38:47.210 --> 02:38:48.510
BRIAN: My goodness.
TALIESIN: Now.

4018
02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:49.343
TRAVIS: You've got a--

4019
02:38:49.343 --> 02:38:51.670
TALIESIN: It is time for you to charge our game soul

4020
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:54.520
with your laughs and your screams.

4021
02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:57.198
(cackling)

4022
02:38:57.198 --> 02:38:58.331
(cat coughs)

4023
02:38:58.331 --> 02:39:00.031
TRAVIS: You're looking kind of--
(cat coughs harder)

4024
02:39:00.031 --> 02:39:02.750
oh, oh, shit, oh.
TALIESIN: Excuse me. (hacks)

4025
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:05.710
BRIAN: Are you vaping, sir? Is he gone?

4026
02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:07.220
TRAVIS: Somebody wants to hit him with something long--

4027
02:39:07.220 --> 02:39:09.650
BRIAN: Where is he?
TRAVIS: There he is, that guy.

4028
02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:11.640
BRIAN: He just exploded all over my face.

4029
02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:13.310
TRAVIS: Yep, that one, well, I don't think that's,

4030
02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:14.770
again, the way we want to phrase it.

4031
02:39:14.770 --> 02:39:16.478
BRIAN: That's what happened.

4032
02:39:16.478 --> 02:39:17.970
Oh, what is this?

4033
02:39:17.970 --> 02:39:19.960
Is that cigarettes?
TRAVIS: Don't open the door again!

4034
02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:21.810
Look, there you go.
BRIAN: Oh, it's ammo.

4035
02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:25.680
Wow, oh my god.

4036
02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:27.280
TRAVIS: Dude, the spookyverse rains candy.

4037
02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.660
BRIAN: Dude, this place is amazing.

4038
02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:32.140
TRAVIS: This is the best thing ever.

4039
02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:34.170
Ah, big bear, big bear chasing me.

4040
02:39:34.170 --> 02:39:35.003
BRIAN: I got him.

4041
02:39:35.003 --> 02:39:36.810
TRAVIS: Big bear chasing me.
BRIAN: I got him.

4042
02:39:38.290 --> 02:39:39.560
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're in trouble.

4043
02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:41.669
Here, I'm going to get over to--

4044
02:39:41.669 --> 02:39:42.705
and I'm going to help you up.
BRIAN: Where is he?

4045
02:39:42.705 --> 02:39:45.740
Aah, let me at him!
TRAVIS: I'll help you out.

4046
02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:46.710
Oh, God, you're walking around

4047
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:48.870
with a doll. Do you know how fucked that is?

4048
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:50.295
BRIAN: I mean--
TRAVIS: If somebody sees us,

4049
02:39:50.295 --> 02:39:51.286
they're going to shoot us.

4050
02:39:51.286 --> 02:39:52.618
BRIAN: It's not that far off from real life.

4051
02:39:52.618 --> 02:39:56.080
TRAVIS: Two people with white jumpsuits,
walking around with dolls?

4052
02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:57.535
BRIAN: Creepy ain't a crime.

4053
02:39:57.535 --> 02:40:00.285
(both screaming)

4054
02:40:01.185 --> 02:40:02.790
Was that mine or yours? You still have yours.

4055
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:06.037
Do I still have mine? Whose was it?

4056
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:11.536
Can we go in there? I don't want to
go in there, but can we?

4057
02:40:11.536 --> 02:40:12.782
TRAVIS: I don't want to play anymore.

4058
02:40:12.782 --> 02:40:17.782
You piece of shit, (screams) I'm going to get you.

4059
02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:21.173
BRIAN: Did you get it?
TRAVIS: I got it. (stammers)

4060
02:40:21.173 --> 02:40:22.157
BRIAN: How did you do it?

4061
02:40:22.157 --> 02:40:23.840
TRAVIS: I ran him down.
BRIAN: Dude, you ran over it?

4062
02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:28.831
BRIAN: (nervous noises)

4063
02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:32.140
We're good.

4064
02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:33.806
TRAVIS: Are we supposed to be--
BRIAN: We're good, we're good, we're good.

4065
02:40:33.806 --> 02:40:35.097
A key-- (screams)

4066
02:40:35.097 --> 02:40:36.863
Fuck!
TRAVIS: Oh, what the fuck is that?

4067
02:40:36.863 --> 02:40:39.760
BRIAN: Fuck!
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4068
02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:42.768
BRIAN: Oh, I threw the doll at her and she took it.

4069
02:40:42.768 --> 02:40:45.320
Fuck, shit!

4070
02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:49.670
Oh, fuck, dude, dude, dude, is she dancing?

4071
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:52.120
TRAVIS: Stop looking at her, dude, stop looking at her.

4072
02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:56.580
BRIAN: Okay, can I kill her with the pen?

4073
02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.290
Oh, god, oh, god, how do I run?

4074
02:40:59.290 --> 02:41:01.998
Oh, fuck me, dude, get me out of here,

4075
02:41:01.998 --> 02:41:05.090
get me out of here, get me out of here, man.

4076
02:41:05.090 --> 02:41:07.757
(screams)

4077
02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:10.480
TRAVIS: No, I'm not looking over there.

4078
02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:12.180
BRIAN: Look.
TRAVIS: No, I'm not looking over there. Nope.

4079
02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:13.880
BRIAN: Look.
TRAVIS: Nope, nope, not doing it.

4080
02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:15.129
BRIAN: (screams)

4081
02:41:15.129 --> 02:41:16.362
TRAVIS: I'm alive.

4082
02:41:16.362 --> 02:41:18.653
BOTH: "You are a doll"?!

4083
02:41:18.653 --> 02:41:20.510
BRIAN: I'm a little doll now!

4084
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:22.693
TRAVIS: What is that?
BRIAN: Fuck, dude.

4085
02:41:24.930 --> 02:41:26.894
TRAVIS: Is that you?
BRIAN: It's me!

4086
02:41:26.894 --> 02:41:30.170
TRAVIS: Come here, can I pick you up,
you little piece of shit?

4087
02:41:30.170 --> 02:41:32.830
You little Toy Story motherfucker, come here.

4088
02:41:32.830 --> 02:41:34.730
Come here, Woody.
BRIAN: You can't get me.

4089
02:41:36.090 --> 02:41:39.458
I have wood. How do I use my wood, Jerry?

4090
02:41:39.458 --> 02:41:41.060
TRAVIS: Can I take this rapier?

4091
02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:42.459
BRIAN: Dude, watch, watch, look,

4092
02:41:42.459 --> 02:41:44.984
I can jump super high.

4093
02:41:44.984 --> 02:41:45.817
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4094
02:41:45.817 --> 02:41:47.554
BRIAN: Later!

4095
02:41:47.554 --> 02:41:49.145
TRAVIS: Oh!

4096
02:41:49.145 --> 02:41:51.557
Oh no! Oh no!

4097
02:41:51.557 --> 02:41:53.173
Why am I walking so slow?!

4098
02:41:53.173 --> 02:41:54.873
Oh, please fucking run.

4099
02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:57.348
Is that her?

4100
02:41:58.296 --> 02:41:59.370
(both screaming)

4101
02:41:59.370 --> 02:42:03.330
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, oh, fuck.
(both screaming)

4102
02:42:03.330 --> 02:42:07.330
BRIAN: Whoa, that looks cool, look, look, look.

4103
02:42:07.330 --> 02:42:11.780
You're stuck, look, but you're still alive. (screams)

4104
02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:16.489
Hey, look, look at me, dude, yeah. (laughs)

4105
02:42:16.489 --> 02:42:21.448
(dramatic orchestral music)

4106
02:54:46.296 --> 02:54:49.460
MATT: And welcome back, so, before we get into it,

4107
02:54:49.460 --> 02:54:51.070
we have our winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.

4108
02:54:51.070 --> 02:54:54.680
The winner tonight is HCHunter18.

4109
02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:55.895
(cheering)

4110
02:54:55.895 --> 02:54:58.058
HCHunter18, congratulations, we'll get

4111
02:54:58.058 --> 02:55:02.090
that to you ASAP, well done.

4112
02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:07.090
All right, so as the adrenaline subsides

4113
02:55:07.344 --> 02:55:12.344
in the calm, still interior of the chamber,

4114
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:14.860
the only sound right now reaching your ears is the hissing

4115
02:55:14.860 --> 02:55:17.660
and bubbling of the liquefying metal

4116
02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:20.690
on the opposite end. Jester and Beauregard a little worse

4117
02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:22.050
for wear, a little frazzled.

4118
02:55:22.050 --> 02:55:25.560
You all take a moment to yourself,

4119
02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:27.040
as there is not danger chasing you

4120
02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:29.840
from doorway to doorway any further.

4121
02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:31.230
TRAVIS: That we know of.

4122
02:55:31.230 --> 02:55:33.500
MATT: That you know of.
TALIESIN: How many people are hurt?

4123
02:55:34.455 --> 02:55:35.530
MARISHA: (groans)

4124
02:55:35.530 --> 02:55:38.160
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to start a--
SAM: I'm fine.

4125
02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:41.730
TALIESIN: -- 10 minute Prayer of Healing
for anybody who wants one.

4126
02:55:41.730 --> 02:55:43.030
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yep.

4127
02:55:43.030 --> 02:55:45.080
LAURA: Hey, Nott?
SAM: Yes?

4128
02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:47.240
LAURA: Do you see a button on how to turn that thing off,

4129
02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:49.680
so that we don't die if we walk on that area

4130
02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:51.260
on the floor, kind of thing?

4131
02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:54.540
SAM: Caduceus, maybe we can aim them so they're off

4132
02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:57.340
to the side or something, or is there an off button?

4133
02:55:58.540 --> 02:56:00.860
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4134
02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:02.790
TRAVIS: Can we bring it with us?

4135
02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:05.080
SAM: 25.
MATT: 25?

4136
02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:07.610
You don't see an off button, but there is

4137
02:56:07.610 --> 02:56:10.000
some sort of a--

4138
02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:14.930
something is feeding it a mass amount of arcane energy.

4139
02:56:14.930 --> 02:56:16.020
Looking at the design of this,

4140
02:56:16.020 --> 02:56:20.380
you get the sense that it shouldn't reload so rapidly,

4141
02:56:20.380 --> 02:56:23.230
but something is feeding it this arcane force,

4142
02:56:23.230 --> 02:56:24.440
and there may be a way to disable it.

4143
02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:26.360
It's dangerous, but it's possible.

4144
02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:30.661
SAM: "Dangerous but possible" is three of my middle names.

4145
02:56:30.661 --> 02:56:32.300
(laughter)

4146
02:56:32.300 --> 02:56:34.840
TALIESIN: 15 hit points to whoever wants it.

4147
02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:36.360
TRAVIS: Bless you. Thank you.

4148
02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:37.720
SAM: I will try--

4149
02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:41.880
LIAM: Well, a question for you, we're going to maybe hole up

4150
02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:43.150
in here for the night?

4151
02:56:43.150 --> 02:56:45.360
LAURA: Yeah, let's try to take a little sleepy.

4152
02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:48.380
LIAM: So if anyone's going to keep watch,

4153
02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:50.560
and that's the only entrance in,

4154
02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:54.373
maybe the folks who stay up man these.

4155
02:56:54.373 --> 02:56:56.090
LAURA: Oh, that's a really good idea.

4156
02:56:57.230 --> 02:57:00.008
SAM: Sure, we'll sleep over here--

4157
02:57:00.008 --> 02:57:03.790
TALIESIN: We could take a look at those boxes, maybe,

4158
02:57:03.790 --> 02:57:04.990
see what's in them?

4159
02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should work
through those boxes before we sleep.

4160
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:10.160
LIAM: Yes, that is correct--

4161
02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:12.120
SAM: But for right now, Jester and Beau are

4162
02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:15.740
on the other side of the death floor, so.

4163
02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:17.480
MARISHA: How's it going on that side of the chamber?

4164
02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:19.760
SAM: Can they come back, can we just aim these away,

4165
02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:21.245
until they walk across?
TRAVIS: This would be a good time

4166
02:57:21.245 --> 02:57:22.810
to just split the team permanently,

4167
02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:23.790
just maybe smoke them right now.

4168
02:57:23.790 --> 02:57:24.980
SAM: This is a sign?
TRAVIS: They're down there.

4169
02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:28.210
MARISHA: This is where we split ways, right here?

4170
02:57:28.210 --> 02:57:30.490
LIAM: Caleb turns into a gigantic owl--
LAURA: It's okay. Beau is the best fighter,

4171
02:57:30.490 --> 02:57:31.565
and I can just keep healing you,

4172
02:57:31.565 --> 02:57:33.440
so we're good.
MARISHA: Honestly,

4173
02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.680
we kind of tanked that fight, I felt like,

4174
02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:38.300
literally, it felt like.

4175
02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:40.650
LIAM: As Beau is bragging, she's being carried

4176
02:57:40.650 --> 02:57:43.420
by the butt by a giant owl across the room.

4177
02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:44.253
MARISHA: Ah!

4178
02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:46.540
LIAM: She never stops, I notice.

4179
02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:48.880
MARISHA: I did not ask for this.
MATT: Okay.

4180
02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:50.625
LIAM: And ferries them both across.

4181
02:57:50.625 --> 02:57:52.918
SAM: Liam, that's not what an owl sounds like.

4182
02:57:52.918 --> 02:57:55.512
LIAM, MARISHA, and LAURA: (terrible hooting imitations)

4183
02:57:55.512 --> 02:57:56.345
SAM: Yeah, that.

4184
02:57:56.345 --> 02:58:01.249
ALL: (terrible hooting imitations)

4185
02:58:01.249 --> 02:58:02.657
(terrible hooting imitations)

4186
02:58:02.657 --> 02:58:04.740
MATT: Sure, yeah, well go with that, that's fine.

4187
02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:07.360
ALL: (terrible hooting imitations)

4188
02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.550
MATT: All righty, so you've all been carried

4189
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:13.290
across the dangerous threshold these devices

4190
02:58:13.290 --> 02:58:16.430
are connected to, you've rotated them to face outward,

4191
02:58:16.430 --> 02:58:18.640
and you have the center of the chamber here

4192
02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:20.707
at your disposal. What are you trying to do now?

4193
02:58:20.707 --> 02:58:24.278
LIAM: Caleb lands, and his head turns 360 degrees.

4194
02:58:24.278 --> 02:58:25.936
SAM: (screams)

4195
02:58:27.211 --> 02:58:29.750
LIAM: (whooshing)
MARISHA: Technically...

4196
02:58:29.750 --> 02:58:32.295
LIAM: Nott, could you--
SAM: Why, of course I could.

4197
02:58:32.295 --> 02:58:36.160
LIAM: Unlock this for me, please?
SAM: Yes. (trills)

4198
02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:39.240
I will try to unlock, nope, not checking for traps,

4199
02:58:39.240 --> 02:58:42.000
just trying to unlock it, 25.

4200
02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.783
MATT: 25, okay.

4201
02:58:43.783 --> 02:58:46.108
You are attempting to just disable this device?

4202
02:58:46.108 --> 02:58:48.310
SAM: Without care.
MATT: Okay.

4203
02:58:48.310 --> 02:58:50.360
LAURA: Great.
MATT: You, with 25,

4204
02:58:50.360 --> 02:58:53.560
manage to disconnect it from this power source,

4205
02:58:53.560 --> 02:58:54.450
and as you--
SAM: Oh, no.

4206
02:58:54.450 --> 02:58:56.850
This is the box.
LIAM: The long box.

4207
02:58:56.850 --> 02:59:00.660
MATT: Oh, I misunderstood, sorry, the long box, 25?

4208
02:59:00.660 --> 02:59:02.600
Yeah, you fiddle with it for a little bit,

4209
02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:05.380
and it opens on, as you finish the lock,

4210
02:59:05.380 --> 02:59:08.008
the cap pops open.
TRAVIS: Ooh!

4211
02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:12.310
LIAM: Slide it out, what's in there?

4212
02:59:12.310 --> 02:59:15.690
MATT: There is a dark metallic rod about that long.

4213
02:59:17.330 --> 02:59:20.150
It has a bit of twilight,

4214
02:59:20.150 --> 02:59:22.890
like a sparkling element to the metal,

4215
02:59:22.890 --> 02:59:24.470
and at the very end of it, you can see,

4216
02:59:24.470 --> 02:59:28.570
there's like this small domed carving

4217
02:59:28.570 --> 02:59:30.880
to the base of it, but it's like a metallic rod,

4218
02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:32.320
about a foot and a half, two feet wide.

4219
02:59:32.320 --> 02:59:33.900
TALIESIN: I don't like anything that we find here.

4220
02:59:33.900 --> 02:59:34.950
LAURA: What do you think it does?

4221
02:59:34.950 --> 02:59:37.150
LIAM: I don't know, I'm not going to test it out.

4222
02:59:37.150 --> 02:59:38.480
SAM: Of course you're going to test it out.

4223
02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:40.600
LAURA: Can't you like look at it really hard

4224
02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:42.230
and figure out what it does or something?

4225
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:44.840
LIAM: Maybe I will do my homework like I always do,

4226
02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:46.110
and know ahead of time what it is,

4227
02:59:46.110 --> 02:59:48.900
instead of decapitating you by accident.

4228
02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:51.616
MARISHA: You want to hit me with it, see what happens?

4229
02:59:51.616 --> 02:59:56.064
LAURA: No, but you're already pretty bloody right now.

4230
02:59:56.064 --> 02:59:57.610
LIAM: I set it down on the ground,

4231
02:59:57.610 --> 03:00:00.580
and then put the, box with a pearl in it,

4232
03:00:00.580 --> 03:00:02.250
or a pearl box, what did you say before?

4233
03:00:02.250 --> 03:00:05.150
MATT: It's a pearlescent box, like the cover

4234
03:00:05.150 --> 03:00:06.770
of it shimmers in the little bit of firelight.

4235
03:00:06.770 --> 03:00:09.770
LAURA: It matches the way that the ballistas look,

4236
03:00:09.770 --> 03:00:12.290
you said they were also pearlescent or something?

4237
03:00:12.290 --> 03:00:13.825
MATT: Kind of--
LIAM: Ivory.

4238
03:00:13.825 --> 03:00:15.200
MATT: Ivory is what they look like.

4239
03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:17.440
This is more pearlescent, so they don't match the devices,

4240
03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:19.400
necessarily.

4241
03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:21.690
LIAM: I'm going to pull my book out, put it on the floor,

4242
03:00:21.690 --> 03:00:23.960
spend the next 20 minutes figuring out

4243
03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:25.330
what these things are, if I can.

4244
03:00:25.330 --> 03:00:27.340
I cast Identify on both of them.

4245
03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:30.370
MATT: Okay, identify on the box, it is a box

4246
03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:32.200
that contains things, it is not magical,

4247
03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:34.100
and it is locked.
LIAM: So I spend 30 minutes--

4248
03:00:34.100 --> 03:00:37.410
okay, locked, okay, so within, after 20 minutes,

4249
03:00:37.410 --> 03:00:39.320
I ask for your help again.

4250
03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:42.370
SAM: I would gladly help you, Caleb, if

4251
03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:47.150
I roll high enough.

4252
03:00:47.150 --> 03:00:50.260
LAURA: Oh, Guidance.
SAM: Too late, 22.

4253
03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:54.310
MATT: 22, you do manage to eventually get that one open.

4254
03:00:54.310 --> 03:00:55.143
It opens up on the inside,

4255
03:00:55.143 --> 03:00:58.804
and you can see a very thin golden circlet.

4256
03:00:58.804 --> 03:01:00.630
It has like a spiral design at the base

4257
03:01:00.630 --> 03:01:03.010
of the center piece, and there's a slight bit

4258
03:01:03.010 --> 03:01:04.640
of a green gem that's fixed in the center,

4259
03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:06.580
and it just rests across the brow.

4260
03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:07.570
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, put it on me.

4261
03:01:07.570 --> 03:01:08.910
SAM: That's an item of atonement.

4262
03:01:08.910 --> 03:01:10.380
LAURA: Put it on me, I want to see--

4263
03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:12.180
TALIESIN: Everything here is bad.
LIAM: But what if

4264
03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:14.680
it gives you a curse, and gives you four extra eyes?

4265
03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:15.513
SAM: Put it on the rod

4266
03:01:15.513 --> 03:01:16.471
and then hit her with it.
LAURA: What if it makes me

4267
03:01:16.471 --> 03:01:18.380
look like a princess?

4268
03:01:18.380 --> 03:01:20.940
MARISHA: Both are kind of hot sounding.
LIAM: You already do.

4269
03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:22.760
I'm going to do my homework.

4270
03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:25.820
So I put it down, and I cast Identify

4271
03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:27.320
on the things on the ground.

4272
03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:28.950
SAM: (fake cough) Nerd!

4273
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:30.350
MARISHA: No fun.
TRAVIS: Can I go to the base

4274
03:01:30.350 --> 03:01:35.070
of the cannons, and see if they are mobile in any way,

4275
03:01:35.070 --> 03:01:37.490
and able to be detached from the floor?

4276
03:01:37.490 --> 03:01:38.520
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

4277
03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:42.610
SAM: Do you have skateboard wheels?
TRAVIS: 18.

4278
03:01:42.610 --> 03:01:46.993
MATT: 18, looking at them, they're currently placed

4279
03:01:47.905 --> 03:01:50.700
intentionally in their current location.

4280
03:01:52.100 --> 03:01:55.610
They could be made mobile with the right alterations,

4281
03:01:55.610 --> 03:01:58.510
but that would require an engineering spark

4282
03:01:58.510 --> 03:02:02.100
and some time. They're siege weaponry,

4283
03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:05.710
they're not intended to be easily mobile.

4284
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:07.020
TRAVIS: They're staying here for a minute.

4285
03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:09.370
LAURA: I'm going to spend as much time as

4286
03:02:09.370 --> 03:02:13.270
I have investigating the walls, looking for secret doors.

4287
03:02:13.270 --> 03:02:15.810
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check for me.

4288
03:02:15.810 --> 03:02:20.510
LAURA: Guide-dance.

4289
03:02:20.510 --> 03:02:22.810
SAM: Super cocked.
LAURA: That is super cocked, okay.

4290
03:02:24.670 --> 03:02:28.086
♪ Still pretty shitty! ♪

4291
03:02:28.086 --> 03:02:31.390
♪ Hold on, let me find the four. ♪

4292
03:02:31.390 --> 03:02:33.130
Not that it matters. I know it doesn't matter,

4293
03:02:33.130 --> 03:02:36.542
but I still want. (laughs)

4294
03:02:36.542 --> 03:02:38.910
Eight.
MATT: Eight, all right.

4295
03:02:38.910 --> 03:02:41.010
You spend a good 30 minutes going

4296
03:02:41.010 --> 03:02:44.300
across the entirety of the chamber that's safe,

4297
03:02:44.300 --> 03:02:46.080
feeling along the walls, checking the edges.

4298
03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:48.020
And no secret doors reveal themselves, no--

4299
03:02:48.020 --> 03:02:51.340
LAURA: No secret doors in this place, you guys, woof.

4300
03:02:51.340 --> 03:02:52.190
MATT: Caleb?
LIAM: Yeah?

4301
03:02:53.311 --> 03:02:57.000
TRAVIS: Unless it's in the floor.
SAM: Oh, Boise.

4302
03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:00.310
We'll find out what those are in about three weeks.

4303
03:03:00.310 --> 03:03:04.130
LIAM: They're pretty short.

4304
03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:11.030
Cool, cool, cool.
SAM: What'd you find, Cay?

4305
03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:20.600
LIAM: Well, this is helpful for many of us,

4306
03:03:21.940 --> 03:03:23.520
and requires attunement.

4307
03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:26.494
LAURA: Which one is the one that you're talking about?

4308
03:03:26.494 --> 03:03:29.130
LIAM: The bigger one.
LAURA: The circular door,

4309
03:03:29.130 --> 03:03:30.150
or the want thingy?

4310
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:32.060
LIAM: The rod is bigger than the circlet.

4311
03:03:33.740 --> 03:03:37.720
This is, it gives you a little more juice magically,

4312
03:03:37.720 --> 03:03:40.300
and gives a couple of spells to use,

4313
03:03:40.300 --> 03:03:44.616
and this one makes you smarter.

4314
03:03:44.616 --> 03:03:46.070
Who wants it?

4315
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:48.820
LAURA: Smart, huh?
SAM: Oh, after today,

4316
03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:51.700
it looks like Caduceus could use it, but.

4317
03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:53.290
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

4318
03:03:53.290 --> 03:03:54.170
SAM: Are you, though?

4319
03:03:54.170 --> 03:03:55.760
TALIESIN: I'm smart enough.

4320
03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:57.640
SAM: For most of that fight, you were drooling.

4321
03:03:57.640 --> 03:04:01.050
LAURA: Who needs the most smarts, don't you need smarts,

4322
03:04:01.050 --> 03:04:02.990
Caleb, or you, Beau?

4323
03:04:02.990 --> 03:04:04.360
LIAM: I'm set in that department.

4324
03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:06.510
LAURA: You're as smart as you could possibly be?

4325
03:04:07.460 --> 03:04:08.293
MARISHA: How smart?

4326
03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:11.150
LIAM: 19, guys, 19.

4327
03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:13.750
LAURA: And it would get you to 20?

4328
03:04:14.930 --> 03:04:16.563
LIAM: I'm already a 20, so it does not help me.

4329
03:04:16.563 --> 03:04:18.130
LAURA: Oh, it would take you to 19.

4330
03:04:18.130 --> 03:04:19.750
MATT: Whoever wears it--
LIAM: Has a 19.

4331
03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:21.888
MATT: Has an intelligence of 19.

4332
03:04:21.888 --> 03:04:23.430
LAURA: That's major.
TALIESIN: I mean,

4333
03:04:23.430 --> 03:04:24.840
that's scary, good god.

4334
03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:26.590
LIAM: Is your spells based on intelligence?

4335
03:04:26.590 --> 03:04:30.460
SAM: They are, but my spells aren't very powerful,

4336
03:04:30.460 --> 03:04:32.214
so if, are your spells based on intelligence?

4337
03:04:32.214 --> 03:04:33.790
LAURA: No, wisdom.

4338
03:04:33.790 --> 03:04:34.623
LIAM: Investigation.

4339
03:04:34.623 --> 03:04:35.860
MARISHA: It does feed into Beau.

4340
03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:36.693
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Really?

4341
03:04:36.693 --> 03:04:38.170
TALIESIN: How much does it boost you?

4342
03:04:38.170 --> 03:04:40.510
MARISHA: All of my Cobalt Soul stuff

4343
03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:42.360
is like a little bit more, but--

4344
03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:46.220
SAM: It will make my spells higher, but my spells--

4345
03:04:46.220 --> 03:04:47.410
LAURA: Do you use intelligence, Fjord?

4346
03:04:47.410 --> 03:04:48.320
No, you use charisma.

4347
03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:51.130
LIAM: What would this even mean for Caduceus?

4348
03:04:51.130 --> 03:04:52.730
Who would that guy be?

4349
03:04:52.730 --> 03:04:54.538
TALIESIN: I don't know who that would be.

4350
03:04:54.538 --> 03:04:57.080
LAURA: Caduceus is incredibly intelligent already.

4351
03:04:57.080 --> 03:04:58.320
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm perfectly fine with--

4352
03:04:58.320 --> 03:05:01.400
LIAM: This is Liam talking, what would that guy be?

4353
03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:03.699
TALIESIN: No fucking--

4354
03:05:03.699 --> 03:05:06.233
I would just start wearing sweater vests and have a pipe.

4355
03:05:06.233 --> 03:05:08.254
(laughter)

4356
03:05:08.254 --> 03:05:09.087
MATT: Other than that, no change.

4357
03:05:09.087 --> 03:05:13.159
TALIESIN: You see, the fundamental change is,
of course, whether or not--

4358
03:05:13.159 --> 03:05:14.410
MATT: You're the brain gremlin from Gremlins 2.

4359
03:05:14.410 --> 03:05:16.260
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, it's the brain gremlin at that point.

4360
03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:17.590
MATT: Talk a little bit, what's going on in this room?

4361
03:05:17.590 --> 03:05:18.720
I think there's some fascinating--

4362
03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:21.000
TALIESIN: Please, let's, if you must.

4363
03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:22.374
MATT: I've seen the movie a few times, shut up.

4364
03:05:22.374 --> 03:05:24.900
LIAM: This is IQ. If it were EQ, I'd keep it.

4365
03:05:24.900 --> 03:05:27.070
TRAVIS: Maybe we sell it.
TALIESIN: What is the, well.

4366
03:05:27.070 --> 03:05:29.200
LAURA: I mean, I can wear it for the time being,

4367
03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:31.230
if you guys, nobody else would use it.

4368
03:05:31.230 --> 03:05:32.960
It would do nothing for me.

4369
03:05:32.960 --> 03:05:34.340
SAM: Well, then don't wear it.

4370
03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:37.170
LAURA: But it will make me
look like a pretty, pretty princess.

4371
03:05:38.140 --> 03:05:38.973
TALIESIN: Beau, what do you think?

4372
03:05:38.973 --> 03:05:41.200
MARISHA: What's your intelligence at, Marisha to Sam?

4373
03:05:43.140 --> 03:05:47.390
SAM: Nott to Marisha says: My intelligence,

4374
03:05:47.390 --> 03:05:50.052
my intelligence is at 16, oh my god,

4375
03:05:50.052 --> 03:05:51.890
where am I, what are these cameras doing here?

4376
03:05:51.890 --> 03:05:56.450
(laughter)
SAM: (yells)

4377
03:05:56.450 --> 03:05:58.340
MATT: He's gone too deep.
SAM: (yells)

4378
03:05:58.340 --> 03:06:02.103
TRAVIS: Hit him, hit him.
(laughter)

4379
03:06:02.103 --> 03:06:05.890
Spin the top.
SAM: Right now, it's 16.

4380
03:06:05.890 --> 03:06:08.730
So 19 would be more.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4381
03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:12.530
SAM: But not by tons, right, it would be plus four,

4382
03:06:12.530 --> 03:06:14.420
instead of a plus three.
MARISHA: My intelligence is 14.

4383
03:06:14.420 --> 03:06:15.253
LAURA: You got to attune to it, right?

4384
03:06:15.253 --> 03:06:17.260
LAURA: See, you should wear it.

4385
03:06:17.260 --> 03:06:19.010
SAM: So you would go from plus two to plus four?

4386
03:06:19.010 --> 03:06:20.840
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Wear a circlet.

4387
03:06:20.840 --> 03:06:21.673
SAM: But what would that get you?

4388
03:06:21.673 --> 03:06:23.250
MARISHA: No, it's not very much my aesthetic.

4389
03:06:23.250 --> 03:06:25.620
It would bump up my investigation.

4390
03:06:27.560 --> 03:06:28.550
SAM: By two points.

4391
03:06:29.390 --> 03:06:30.310
TRAVIS: Maybe you can wear it on your calf.

4392
03:06:30.310 --> 03:06:33.610
MARISHA: So investigation would be eight.

4393
03:06:33.610 --> 03:06:35.330
TRAVIS: May be able to bend the circlet

4394
03:06:35.330 --> 03:06:37.100
to a design that more befits you,

4395
03:06:37.100 --> 03:06:37.933
you don't feel like you have

4396
03:06:37.933 --> 03:06:40.060
to change your aesthetic for a magical item.

4397
03:06:40.060 --> 03:06:41.690
TRAVIS: Put it on one of those guns, yeah?

4398
03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:42.800
MARISHA: Yeah, it would just mainly,

4399
03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:44.780
it would boost up my skills, so--

4400
03:06:44.780 --> 03:06:46.150
LAURA: Put it on, I'm going to,

4401
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:47.890
I'll do your hair around it and stuff,

4402
03:06:47.890 --> 03:06:49.680
I'll make it look cool, okay, Beau?

4403
03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:51.780
MARISHA: I don't have a full attunement.

4404
03:06:51.780 --> 03:06:52.613
TALIESIN: Oh, right, then--

4405
03:06:52.613 --> 03:06:56.370
LAURA: Put it on, I'll just, I'll fix your hair around it,

4406
03:06:56.370 --> 03:06:57.660
you'll look super cool still.

4407
03:06:57.660 --> 03:06:58.560
MARISHA: Okay, because it's not really,

4408
03:06:58.560 --> 03:07:00.320
this is a little princessy.

4409
03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:01.890
LAURA: I know, that's why I like it.

4410
03:07:01.890 --> 03:07:03.530
TALIESIN: You can do a leather wrap.

4411
03:07:03.530 --> 03:07:06.060
SAM: Or like a tight, a tight--

4412
03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:07.750
MARISHA: Ooh, can you make it look like a choker?

4413
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:09.530
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: I'd allow it.

4414
03:07:09.530 --> 03:07:11.500
Sure, it's a neck band of intellect.

4415
03:07:11.500 --> 03:07:13.920
MARISHA: Here, I'll let you do your thing first.

4416
03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:14.845
LAURA: It's real swirly.

4417
03:07:14.845 --> 03:07:19.240
Okay, I'm going to add some cool leather wrap around it

4418
03:07:19.240 --> 03:07:21.160
and stuff to make it look like a leather

4419
03:07:21.160 --> 03:07:23.530
headband thing, and then, yeah,

4420
03:07:23.530 --> 03:07:26.290
but I'm going to make it above the hairline,

4421
03:07:26.290 --> 03:07:27.840
and then I'm going to tie your braid,

4422
03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:30.390
like, make braids in cool things--

4423
03:07:30.390 --> 03:07:32.070
MARISHA: You're tying it, like wire wrapping it

4424
03:07:32.070 --> 03:07:32.903
into the braid?

4425
03:07:32.903 --> 03:07:34.380
LAURA: Yeah, wire wrapping it into your hair.

4426
03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:35.580
MARISHA: That's kind of cool.
MATT: That's kind of cool,

4427
03:07:35.580 --> 03:07:38.269
all right, I'll allow it.

4428
03:07:38.269 --> 03:07:41.540
SAM: Or a huge nose ring.
(laughter)

4429
03:07:41.540 --> 03:07:44.318
MATT: This gargantuan septum piercing just dangling.

4430
03:07:44.318 --> 03:07:47.260
LAURA: It goes below, like under the, undercut--

4431
03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:49.193
TALIESIN: Who runs the border town?

4432
03:07:49.193 --> 03:07:51.590
MATT: That'd be pretty awesome, okay.

4433
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:53.840
MARISHA: Okay, am I getting this?

4434
03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:55.020
SAM: For now.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4435
03:07:55.020 --> 03:07:56.200
MARISHA: Okay!

4436
03:07:56.200 --> 03:07:58.130
LAURA: It's going to be a real bitch to get it out,

4437
03:07:58.130 --> 03:08:00.140
so if anybody wants it.

4438
03:08:01.380 --> 03:08:02.930
TRAVIS: What about the rod?

4439
03:08:02.930 --> 03:08:07.580
TALIESIN: What's the rod do?
LIAM: Well. You know.

4440
03:08:07.580 --> 03:08:09.790
Almost any of us could use this,

4441
03:08:09.790 --> 03:08:11.230
so I will let you decide.

4442
03:08:13.010 --> 03:08:16.180
It makes it easier for you to throw spells at things,

4443
03:08:16.180 --> 03:08:20.790
and it has three spells that you get to use.

4444
03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:22.340
LAURA: Which spells?
LIAM: Here.

4445
03:08:22.340 --> 03:08:25.273
Take a look at the paper.

4446
03:08:25.273 --> 03:08:27.180
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA and TALIESIN: Whoa.

4447
03:08:29.561 --> 03:08:31.311
TALIESIN: Are you sure you don't want this?

4448
03:08:32.310 --> 03:08:35.770
SAM: Oh, that's a cool spell, oh, these are all cool spells.

4449
03:08:35.770 --> 03:08:38.730
LIAM: I do want it, but I am full up,

4450
03:08:38.730 --> 03:08:40.490
and need the things that I have.

4451
03:08:40.490 --> 03:08:43.320
SAM: I think that's for both of you, not for me.

4452
03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:45.360
LAURA: Well, this could also be for Fjord.

4453
03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:46.900
LIAM: For Fjord, yeah.

4454
03:08:46.900 --> 03:08:50.960
Any of you, except for--
TALIESIN: Who's not full up?

4455
03:08:50.960 --> 03:08:53.170
SAM: For those who care, this is the Rod

4456
03:08:53.170 --> 03:08:55.030
of the Solitary Scout.

4457
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:56.480
TRAVIS: Well, I have two spell slots,

4458
03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:00.390
so anything that has spells in an object would be amazing.

4459
03:09:00.390 --> 03:09:02.840
LAURA: I mean, it says it's the Rod of Solitary Scout,

4460
03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:04.840
two bonus spells and attack roll.

4461
03:09:04.840 --> 03:09:06.730
So this is good for people scouting ahead,

4462
03:09:06.730 --> 03:09:08.700
it gives you Expeditious Retreat, Grease,

4463
03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:10.290
and Magic Mouth. It'd be really good

4464
03:09:10.290 --> 03:09:12.010
for people sneaking.
LIAM: It'd be very good for Nott.

4465
03:09:12.010 --> 03:09:13.863
SAM: Like me?
LIAM: Yeah, you.

4466
03:09:13.863 --> 03:09:17.360
Those spells are your kinds of spells, they're tricky.

4467
03:09:18.630 --> 03:09:19.920
SAM: But a plus two bonus

4468
03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:21.900
to spell attack rolls would help you.

4469
03:09:22.810 --> 03:09:23.980
TALIESIN: Well--

4470
03:09:23.980 --> 03:09:26.360
MATT: Spell attack rolls help--
SAM: Fjord?

4471
03:09:26.360 --> 03:09:27.800
MATT: Then you couldn't use a shield.

4472
03:09:29.827 --> 03:09:30.660
Because the rod, to hold the rod,

4473
03:09:30.660 --> 03:09:33.030
it does have to have one hand to use.

4474
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:36.210
LAURA: Oh, so it'd really be me or Caduceus, or--

4475
03:09:36.210 --> 03:09:37.060
MATT: Well, it's up to you guys.

4476
03:09:37.060 --> 03:09:38.610
I'm just saying, you could use the rod.

4477
03:09:38.610 --> 03:09:39.700
MARISHA: Do you want to?

4478
03:09:39.700 --> 03:09:42.550
LIAM: I mean, any of you could have it holstered

4479
03:09:42.550 --> 03:09:44.020
to your back, and pull it up when you want

4480
03:09:44.020 --> 03:09:46.580
to use it. I would probably recommend it for Nott,

4481
03:09:46.580 --> 03:09:48.480
but it would work for any of us.

4482
03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:50.920
TALIESIN: Nott, I feel like it's, yeah, one of you two.

4483
03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:53.628
MATT: Do you have any spells that do spell attack?

4484
03:09:56.140 --> 03:09:58.440
SAM: No, I don't think so, not yet anyway.

4485
03:09:58.440 --> 03:09:59.273
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Grease is awesome.

4486
03:09:59.273 --> 03:10:01.370
MATT: Well, if you ever did, that would help.

4487
03:10:01.370 --> 03:10:04.000
Otherwise, it would help--
SAM: Shocking Grasp.

4488
03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:04.833
That's it.
MATT: That's one.

4489
03:10:04.833 --> 03:10:06.220
LIAM: I mean, Grease, Magic Mouth,

4490
03:10:06.220 --> 03:10:08.810
and Expeditious Retreat are great Nott spells.

4491
03:10:08.810 --> 03:10:12.330
MARISHA: Expeditious Retreat is a dope spell

4492
03:10:12.330 --> 03:10:14.670
that is not to be ignored. That was one

4493
03:10:14.670 --> 03:10:17.360
that I slept on as a druid for quite some time,

4494
03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:18.410
and I think you can cast it--

4495
03:10:18.410 --> 03:10:20.780
LIAM: It saved my bacon on Avantika's ship.

4496
03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:22.605
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: Magic mouth's pretty fun.

4497
03:10:22.605 --> 03:10:25.300
You get to leave a Sending spell

4498
03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:27.320
at a location, and with a certain trigger,

4499
03:10:27.320 --> 03:10:29.990
and when it triggers, it says 25 words,

4500
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:32.620
but it stays for every time it's triggered.

4501
03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:35.300
So that can be fun or ridiculous.

4502
03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:37.800
TALIESIN: I feel like I want to see what you do with that.

4503
03:10:38.730 --> 03:10:41.440
LAURA: Yeah, you could do some really cool things with it.

4504
03:10:41.440 --> 03:10:42.300
SAM: For now.

4505
03:10:42.300 --> 03:10:43.420
LIAM: You're clever, you're creative.

4506
03:10:43.420 --> 03:10:45.410
TALIESIN: You have, and you have a slot?

4507
03:10:45.410 --> 03:10:48.810
SAM: No, but I will if someone wants to take the Dagger

4508
03:10:48.810 --> 03:10:51.020
of Denial.
LAURA: What's the dagger of denial?

4509
03:10:51.020 --> 03:10:54.400
SAM: That's the one that can lock things.

4510
03:10:54.400 --> 03:10:56.410
TALIESIN: I think whoever has a slot.

4511
03:10:56.410 --> 03:10:58.460
LAURA: I've got two slots, I don't have.

4512
03:10:58.460 --> 03:11:00.486
TRAVIS: That door in the Arcane Armory,

4513
03:11:00.486 --> 03:11:02.286
where the golem came through,

4514
03:11:02.286 --> 03:11:04.290
there was no keyhole on there, right?

4515
03:11:04.290 --> 03:11:06.472
It was like a portal.

4516
03:11:06.472 --> 03:11:08.531
MATT: There were two doors that were open,

4517
03:11:08.531 --> 03:11:09.630
and the portal was behind the door,

4518
03:11:09.630 --> 03:11:10.930
so the doors never closed.

4519
03:11:12.690 --> 03:11:14.180
SAM: Well, you have attack spells.

4520
03:11:14.180 --> 03:11:15.013
LAURA: I do.

4521
03:11:15.013 --> 03:11:15.846
TALIESIN: Do you have a shield, though?

4522
03:11:15.846 --> 03:11:18.480
TRAVIS: Did we disable the floor in the hallway,

4523
03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:19.660
did we disable the floor--

4524
03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:22.840
SAM: No, we did not disable it, I don't know how.

4525
03:11:22.840 --> 03:11:24.760
I guess I could go look.
TRAVIS: How many spells

4526
03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:26.420
have you got?
SAM: Huh?

4527
03:11:26.420 --> 03:11:27.800
LIAM: How many spells do you know?

4528
03:11:29.650 --> 03:11:30.483
SAM: 11.

4529
03:11:30.483 --> 03:11:31.830
LIAM: That's three more spells.
SAM: Oh, I would love it.

4530
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:35.490
LIAM: It diversifies your portfolio.
SAM: I would love it, but, you know.

4531
03:11:35.490 --> 03:11:36.660
We can talk about this later.

4532
03:11:36.660 --> 03:11:39.470
TRAVIS: I'm 80 feet from the doors, could I just see maybe

4533
03:11:39.470 --> 03:11:42.470
in the keyholes underneath the handles?

4534
03:11:42.470 --> 03:11:43.500
MATT: Just as a note,

4535
03:11:43.500 --> 03:11:44.650
just so you're aware...

4536
03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:47.800
TALIESIN: See, I would be--
MATT: Hang on, I have to double.

4537
03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:48.920
TALIESIN: Especially if you don't have a lot of--

4538
03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:50.500
MATT: Let me double check something on the crossbow.

4539
03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:52.440
LAURA: I only have one thing attuned, so.

4540
03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:55.380
MATT: So you reload a crossbow with a free hand,

4541
03:11:55.380 --> 03:11:56.213
just as a head's up.

4542
03:11:56.213 --> 03:11:58.260
MARISHA: How much does it give to your spell attack?

4543
03:11:58.260 --> 03:12:00.950
MATT: So you have to decide between switching

4544
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:04.030
if you did it, so just be aware of that, it's fine, but.

4545
03:12:04.030 --> 03:12:05.720
SAM: You can't have because of a shield?

4546
03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:08.040
LAURA: No, I can have it because I have a shield,

4547
03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:11.310
and I don't use a weapon, I cast.

4548
03:12:12.390 --> 03:12:14.720
So I could use a wand for my hand.

4549
03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:16.692
TALIESIN: Then you should take it.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4550
03:12:16.692 --> 03:12:18.590
MARISHA: I think Jes would--

4551
03:12:18.590 --> 03:12:20.390
MATT: It's up to you guys. I mean, just saying,

4552
03:12:20.390 --> 03:12:22.020
if you wanted to spell cast, you'd just have

4553
03:12:22.020 --> 03:12:24.280
to put your crossbow away, probably,

4554
03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:28.230
or swap them to use it, it's not a huge issue.

4555
03:12:31.193 --> 03:12:32.426
LAURA: I'll hold it for now.

4556
03:12:32.426 --> 03:12:35.592
MARISHA: (laughs)

4557
03:12:35.592 --> 03:12:36.880
LAURA: We'll talk about it. Okay.

4558
03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:37.900
TALIESIN: Plus two, man.

4559
03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:40.750
LIAM: Also, before we sleep in here,

4560
03:12:40.750 --> 03:12:44.850
I would like to try to examine and investigate this collar,

4561
03:12:44.850 --> 03:12:47.075
to see if it-- collar--

4562
03:12:47.075 --> 03:12:50.120
to see if it is completely destroyed

4563
03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:55.098
and broken, or if it could be reconstituted, yeah.

4564
03:12:56.350 --> 03:12:57.183
MATT: Make an arcana check.

4565
03:12:57.183 --> 03:13:00.580
TALIESIN: Also, the machine isn't doing anything, right?

4566
03:13:00.580 --> 03:13:02.380
It's still a smoldering--
MATT: Yeah.

4567
03:13:02.380 --> 03:13:04.080
The golem is destroyed.
TALIESIN: Okay.

4568
03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:06.620
LIAM: Balls, I rolled a two

4569
03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:07.453
It's a 12.

4570
03:13:09.813 --> 03:13:12.580
MATT: It's hard to tell. Its design was intrinsically tied

4571
03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:13.620
to the golem.

4572
03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:15.290
LIAM: A dead fly that flew off your page,

4573
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:16.590
I'm sorry, that was gross.

4574
03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:18.840
MARISHA: What, me?

4575
03:13:18.840 --> 03:13:21.150
LIAM: Yeah, you went, and this thing went, anyway.

4576
03:13:21.150 --> 03:13:22.030
You were saying, Matt?

4577
03:13:22.030 --> 03:13:23.650
MATT: You killed it with your paper.

4578
03:13:23.650 --> 03:13:24.790
MARISHA: What?

4579
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:25.690
MATT: Congratulations.

4580
03:13:27.620 --> 03:13:30.820
The device was tied to the golem, as far as its design,

4581
03:13:30.820 --> 03:13:34.730
so you're not sure if it, with the golem destroyed,

4582
03:13:34.730 --> 03:13:35.940
it's no longer powered or not.

4583
03:13:35.940 --> 03:13:37.630
You didn't roll high enough to really tell whether

4584
03:13:37.630 --> 03:13:40.110
or not it still manages to function.

4585
03:13:40.110 --> 03:13:43.390
LIAM: Okay, I'm still going to fiddle with it before bed.

4586
03:13:43.390 --> 03:13:45.200
Not roll anything, and hold onto it.

4587
03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:47.770
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's it.

4588
03:13:47.770 --> 03:13:49.220
MATT: All right.

4589
03:13:49.220 --> 03:13:51.139
You guys are taking a short rest here?

4590
03:13:51.139 --> 03:13:52.400
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Are we sleeping?

4591
03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:54.560
MATT: Long rest?
LIAM: Hey, are we resting?

4592
03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:56.960
TALIESIN: Are we at the point, in effect, time wise,

4593
03:13:56.960 --> 03:13:59.760
are we at the point where a long rest would make sense?

4594
03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:01.070
MATT: It's up to you guys.
TALIESIN: I mean--

4595
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:03.350
LIAM: But how long has it been since we,

4596
03:14:03.350 --> 03:14:04.965
how many hours does it feel--

4597
03:14:04.965 --> 03:14:06.780
TRAVIS: We got to go back through the Tower,

4598
03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:09.910
through the Golem Workshop, through the Experiment Chambers,

4599
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:10.970
through the Heart Study.

4600
03:14:10.970 --> 03:14:12.350
MATT: I'll say between waking up, getting ready

4601
03:14:12.350 --> 03:14:13.560
to leave in the morning of Rosohna

4602
03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:15.050
and everything that happened with Essek before you left,

4603
03:14:15.050 --> 03:14:16.180
I'd say it's been about probably eight hours

4604
03:14:16.180 --> 03:14:18.220
since you guys woke up.

4605
03:14:18.220 --> 03:14:19.620
TRAVIS: We should do it, we don't know

4606
03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:21.040
when we're going to find another safe space--

4607
03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:23.480
TALIESIN: No, this is as close to--
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's not be dumb.

4608
03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:25.390
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I agree.

4609
03:14:25.390 --> 03:14:28.540
TALIESIN: Also, I've got a strange idea.

4610
03:14:28.540 --> 03:14:32.760
Why don't we put the dome right against the door,

4611
03:14:32.760 --> 03:14:36.290
so that whatever comes through can't use,

4612
03:14:36.290 --> 03:14:39.780
if we get another golem, won't be able

4613
03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:42.370
to un-magic everything.

4614
03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:45.680
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4615
03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:50.680
LIAM: It's tricky because it probably can't expand

4616
03:14:50.730 --> 03:14:54.450
into another plane. I assume we're

4617
03:14:54.450 --> 03:14:56.450
on a different place than where we were.

4618
03:14:58.000 --> 03:14:59.510
TRAVIS: Also don't want anything to try and figure out

4619
03:14:59.510 --> 03:15:02.530
to go underneath it, right?
LIAM: So if we were to jut the--

4620
03:15:02.530 --> 03:15:03.890
I'm just thinking of the mathematics of it,

4621
03:15:03.890 --> 03:15:06.060
sorry, this side of it up against the door would

4622
03:15:06.060 --> 03:15:10.284
just be open to the inside of the dome.

4623
03:15:11.140 --> 03:15:12.990
I think it's better just to cover us.

4624
03:15:14.230 --> 03:15:15.530
We would still be covered.

4625
03:15:17.020 --> 03:15:19.640
TALIESIN: We'd just be putting one side of the dome right up

4626
03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:21.500
against the door, is my thought.

4627
03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:23.330
LIAM: But it would continue to go down,

4628
03:15:23.330 --> 03:15:25.460
and through the door is another--

4629
03:15:25.460 --> 03:15:28.190
TALIESIN: No, no, no, it's just the door, and then.

4630
03:15:28.190 --> 03:15:29.220
LIAM: Does it go flat?

4631
03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:30.910
TRAVIS: Yeah, it'd slope down into the bottom--

4632
03:15:30.910 --> 03:15:32.270
MATT: It's like this, so there'll be--

4633
03:15:32.270 --> 03:15:34.340
it'd be against the door, but there'd be like an open--

4634
03:15:34.340 --> 03:15:35.200
TALIESIN: Sure.

4635
03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:36.990
TRAVIS: I don't think it blocks
as much as you think it does.

4636
03:15:36.990 --> 03:15:37.823
I think it's probably like--

4637
03:15:37.823 --> 03:15:39.000
TALIESIN: That's probably true.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4638
03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:40.370
MATT: But whatever you guys want to do.

4639
03:15:40.370 --> 03:15:41.203
LAURA: Where are you putting the dome?

4640
03:15:41.203 --> 03:15:43.160
TRAVIS: We're going to put it between the cannons, right,

4641
03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:44.560
so we have--
SAM: Yeah.

4642
03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:45.393
LAURA: Okay, good.

4643
03:15:45.393 --> 03:15:47.828
LIAM: People who are-- oh, he's alive.

4644
03:15:49.719 --> 03:15:50.569
LIAM: Oh, God.
LAURA: Oh!

4645
03:15:51.465 --> 03:15:52.900
LIAM: That's what Matt said.

4646
03:15:52.900 --> 03:15:55.295
SAM: No, he's on Marisha's head!

4647
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:59.420
LIAM: Well, you did swat him.
MATT: Good.

4648
03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:01.730
TRAVIS: I don't want to smote your head.

4649
03:16:01.730 --> 03:16:03.430
MATT: That would have been great, all right.

4650
03:16:03.430 --> 03:16:05.500
LIAM: Anyone who's keeping watch, take lessons

4651
03:16:05.500 --> 03:16:07.250
from Nott on how these cannons work,

4652
03:16:07.250 --> 03:16:08.910
and man them.
LAURA: Okay.

4653
03:16:08.910 --> 03:16:11.510
SAM: Or woman them.
LAURA: (laughs)

4654
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:13.120
LIAM: Yes, it's implied, Nott.
MATT: Okay.

4655
03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:14.850
So the dome will only last for eight hours,

4656
03:16:14.850 --> 03:16:16.480
so there'll be somebody who takes watch

4657
03:16:16.480 --> 03:16:18.760
that spends four hours sleeping outside of the dome.

4658
03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:20.270
TRAVIS: First watch, four hours.

4659
03:16:20.270 --> 03:16:22.610
MATT: And it's also four more days of time that passes by.

4660
03:16:23.680 --> 03:16:24.970
MARISHA: If you haven't done any research

4661
03:16:24.970 --> 03:16:26.830
into quantum physics, it's actually--

4662
03:16:26.830 --> 03:16:28.160
LAURA: If we take a watch, you mean, if somebody--

4663
03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:30.130
MATT: You guys take a watch, for
everyone to get a full rest,

4664
03:16:30.130 --> 03:16:32.550
it's 12 hours--
LAURA: Let's not take a watch.

4665
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:33.730
MATT: Just so you're aware.

4666
03:16:33.730 --> 03:16:35.080
TRAVIS: I don't need a long rest.

4667
03:16:36.320 --> 03:16:38.725
LAURA: You don't?
TRAVIS: No, I just need a short rest.

4668
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:41.900
LAURA: But you'll be exhausted if all of us keep going.

4669
03:16:41.900 --> 03:16:43.870
TRAVIS: One level of exhaustion.

4670
03:16:43.870 --> 03:16:46.350
MATT: Eventually, you still have a few-- a little more time

4671
03:16:46.350 --> 03:16:47.550
before you start hitting exhaustion levels.

4672
03:16:47.550 --> 03:16:49.170
So you guys are sleeping a little early in the day--

4673
03:16:49.170 --> 03:16:51.320
LAURA: Okay, then yeah, let's do that.

4674
03:16:51.320 --> 03:16:54.337
MATT: Okay, so you keep a watch?

4675
03:16:56.920 --> 03:16:58.378
TRAVIS: Light green, right?

4676
03:17:00.260 --> 03:17:03.280
MATT: All right, so you guys go ahead and take a long rest.

4677
03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:05.970
LAURA: I've got to manage my fucking spells, Jesus.

4678
03:17:05.970 --> 03:17:06.820
SAM: Long resting?

4679
03:17:06.820 --> 03:17:09.635
MATT: That's eight more days that have passed in Exandria.

4680
03:17:09.635 --> 03:17:11.470
(gasps)
SAM: Oh, shit.

4681
03:17:11.470 --> 03:17:14.130
MARISHA: Oh, wait, we should probably
check in with Allura, right?

4682
03:17:14.130 --> 03:17:16.450
LAURA: Yeah, she's probably wondering where we are.

4683
03:17:16.450 --> 03:17:18.250
MARISHA: She probably thinks we're dead.

4684
03:17:18.250 --> 03:17:20.360
TRAVIS: Or do we save that for when we really need it?

4685
03:17:20.360 --> 03:17:22.300
LAURA: No, I should--
TRAVIS: Like a smart ass--

4686
03:17:22.300 --> 03:17:24.140
LAURA: Well, no, because this thing works--

4687
03:17:24.140 --> 03:17:25.730
MATT: Are you doing it before you--

4688
03:17:25.730 --> 03:17:27.600
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do it before we take a long rest,

4689
03:17:27.600 --> 03:17:32.042
because it works--
LIAM: Three times per rest?

4690
03:17:33.740 --> 03:17:36.468
LAURA: Three times per 24 hours.
MATT: Correct.

4691
03:17:37.540 --> 03:17:39.240
TRAVIS: Which 24?

4692
03:17:39.240 --> 03:17:41.632
MATT: It's considered your relative one.

4693
03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:45.350
MARISHA: We've used it once?
LAURA: We've used it once.

4694
03:17:45.350 --> 03:17:47.430
Okay, we'll use it when we wake up.

4695
03:17:47.430 --> 03:17:50.340
MATT: Okay, you guys go ahead and take a long rest.

4696
03:17:50.340 --> 03:17:51.640
Fjord, go ahead and make a perception check

4697
03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:53.880
for me as you take your watch.

4698
03:17:53.880 --> 03:17:55.802
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

4699
03:17:57.970 --> 03:17:59.988
18.
MATT: 18, okay.

4700
03:18:01.100 --> 03:18:04.510
A quiet, lonely contemplative eight hour period

4701
03:18:04.510 --> 03:18:07.320
of you sitting in the chair of the arcane cannon,

4702
03:18:08.300 --> 03:18:09.683
looking out ahead.

4703
03:18:11.437 --> 03:18:13.936
SAM: Oh, sorry.

4704
03:18:13.936 --> 03:18:15.789
MATT: It's fucking--

4705
03:18:15.789 --> 03:18:17.722
SAM: ♪ The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly theme ♪

4706
03:18:20.445 --> 03:18:21.945
MATT: Uneventful,

4707
03:18:21.945 --> 03:18:24.130
and you spend time to think about yourself,

4708
03:18:24.130 --> 03:18:26.450
where you are, your friends, what you're after,

4709
03:18:26.450 --> 03:18:29.808
how Yasha might be,

4710
03:18:30.716 --> 03:18:32.366
who she might be,

4711
03:18:32.366 --> 03:18:34.640
debating your own internal conflict

4712
03:18:34.640 --> 03:18:38.390
of what to expect, should you cross paths again.

4713
03:18:38.390 --> 03:18:40.160
What the Angel of Irons is,

4714
03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:44.310
and all the information you've gained and still seek.

4715
03:18:44.310 --> 03:18:48.160
And that time, just spend thinking on it all,

4716
03:18:48.160 --> 03:18:50.770
as well as this newfound path with the Wild Mother

4717
03:18:50.770 --> 03:18:53.680
and what that means to you, and you and Caduceus,

4718
03:18:53.680 --> 03:18:57.067
and the future ahead.

4719
03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:02.740
But you all complete your long rest without incident.

4720
03:19:02.740 --> 03:19:05.357
You wake up, just as the dome vanishes.

4721
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:08.880
There is no sunlight, there is no sense of time,

4722
03:19:08.880 --> 03:19:12.000
except for with Caleb. You all get a big groggy

4723
03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:15.280
as you come to consciousness, bringing whatever semblance

4724
03:19:15.280 --> 03:19:18.300
of a meal you want to prepare for a quick breakfast here

4725
03:19:18.300 --> 03:19:23.272
in the middle of this, whatever this room may be.

4726
03:19:25.020 --> 03:19:26.450
SAM: So if we leave here,

4727
03:19:26.450 --> 03:19:29.390
we'll have to go back up the tower, right?

4728
03:19:29.390 --> 03:19:32.698
TRAVIS: To that door that had the--
SAM: Past the gears.

4729
03:19:32.698 --> 03:19:34.000
TRAVIS: Past the gears.

4730
03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:35.800
LAURA: The greenish blue.

4731
03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:38.493
SAM: How are we going to get past the gears? Do we have--

4732
03:19:38.493 --> 03:19:41.090
LIAM: Hopefully we can take our time a bit more.

4733
03:19:41.090 --> 03:19:45.040
We were rushed, out of preservation,

4734
03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:47.380
unless there are more of these things.

4735
03:19:47.380 --> 03:19:49.640
LAURA: Well, there's a whole golem whatever,

4736
03:19:49.640 --> 03:19:51.740
so there probably more of them.

4737
03:19:51.740 --> 03:19:53.740
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, golem workshop.

4738
03:19:55.141 --> 03:19:56.400
MARISHA: So does this mean we're going to have an army

4739
03:19:56.400 --> 03:19:58.780
of these things chasing us by the time we--

4740
03:19:58.780 --> 03:20:00.905
TRAVIS: Probably at least a handful.

4741
03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:06.314
LAURA: But now we know, at least, don't use fire.

4742
03:20:06.314 --> 03:20:08.620
TRAVIS: Comedy comes in threes.
LIAM: Against them, yeah.

4743
03:20:08.620 --> 03:20:10.628
TRAVIS: Or against that one.

4744
03:20:12.080 --> 03:20:14.345
MARISHA: And that was the one that saw us when we entered.

4745
03:20:14.345 --> 03:20:17.690
Maybe if we just try to avoid being seen by any more.

4746
03:20:17.690 --> 03:20:20.000
TRAVIS: Is it also tracking our magic use?

4747
03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:23.063
Is it tracking the mirror, does it just hate life?

4748
03:20:23.063 --> 03:20:24.158
Who am I?
LAURA: I'm going to use the mirror.

4749
03:20:24.158 --> 03:20:25.650
(laughter)

4750
03:20:25.650 --> 03:20:29.859
SAM: You need sleep, Fjord.
(laughter)

4751
03:20:29.859 --> 03:20:31.309
LAURA: I'm going to use the mirror.

4752
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:33.208
MATT: Okay.

4753
03:20:33.208 --> 03:20:34.860
LAURA: Hi-i-i-i-i-i!

4754
03:20:35.850 --> 03:20:38.220
Allura?
MATT: "Hello, yes."

4755
03:20:38.220 --> 03:20:41.260
LAURA: Hi, so it's probably been a while there, huh?

4756
03:20:41.260 --> 03:20:44.250
MATT: "Quite a bit, I'm happy to hear from you,

4757
03:20:44.250 --> 03:20:45.860
"is everyone all right?"
LAURA: We are not dead!

4758
03:20:45.860 --> 03:20:47.232
Here, everyone say hi.

4759
03:20:47.232 --> 03:20:48.335
TRAVIS: Hi, Allura!

4760
03:20:48.335 --> 03:20:49.858
MATT: "Thank goodness."
LAURA: We just took a sleep

4761
03:20:49.858 --> 03:20:52.440
because we were really almost about to die.

4762
03:20:52.440 --> 03:20:56.110
MATT: "Of course, I'm glad you didn't, well done.

4763
03:20:56.110 --> 03:20:58.920
"How goes it. Have you found Yussa yet?"

4764
03:20:58.920 --> 03:21:01.520
LAURA: No, but we did find a room

4765
03:21:01.520 --> 03:21:03.982
where we couldn't get out of.

4766
03:21:05.105 --> 03:21:07.020
MATT: "Do you mean you're stuck, as well?"

4767
03:21:07.020 --> 03:21:09.650
LAURA: No, we are about to go through the door.

4768
03:21:09.650 --> 03:21:12.170
We just want to let you know where we were and stuff.

4769
03:21:12.170 --> 03:21:13.660
SAM: Use Disguise Self and turn yourself

4770
03:21:13.660 --> 03:21:14.880
into an animoji.

4771
03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:16.808
LAURA: No, I don't want to waste it.

4772
03:21:16.808 --> 03:21:18.260
(laughter)

4773
03:21:18.260 --> 03:21:20.770
TRAVIS: Ask her if she sent anyone else in after us.

4774
03:21:20.770 --> 03:21:22.990
LAURA: Did you send in anyone else in after us?

4775
03:21:22.990 --> 03:21:25.390
MATT: "No, I'd given myself a two to three week period

4776
03:21:25.390 --> 03:21:27.820
"of time of no communication before I did so."

4777
03:21:27.820 --> 03:21:30.380
LAURA: That's probably smart because each of our rests,

4778
03:21:30.380 --> 03:21:32.620
when we go to sleep, it's only a week, right?

4779
03:21:32.620 --> 03:21:33.453
MATT: "Yes."

4780
03:21:33.453 --> 03:21:36.040
LAURA: So then I will let you know if we wake up

4781
03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:38.330
because I think I've got one more of these uses

4782
03:21:38.330 --> 03:21:42.190
of this mirror before we don't have it anymore.

4783
03:21:42.190 --> 03:21:44.755
MATT: "Well, be sparing and careful.

4784
03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:46.990
"Keep me updated."

4785
03:21:46.990 --> 03:21:48.460
SAM: Flip it this way so she can see all of us--

4786
03:21:48.460 --> 03:21:50.610
LAURA: Oh, sorry, yeah, if you turn it to the side,

4787
03:21:50.610 --> 03:21:52.300
you'll get a better-- no, you need

4788
03:21:52.300 --> 03:21:54.219
to turn yours to the--
MATT: "I turn this--

4789
03:21:54.219 --> 03:21:55.820
"Does that work?"
LAURA: Yeah, that's better.

4790
03:21:55.820 --> 03:21:58.680
MATT: "All right, that is better.

4791
03:21:59.871 --> 03:22:03.199
MATT: "I don't know why, I've always
turned it the other way, this whole time."

4792
03:22:03.199 --> 03:22:06.640
TRAVIS: Grandma.
(laughter)

4793
03:22:06.640 --> 03:22:09.040
LAURA: Did you learn anything else? It's been a week.

4794
03:22:09.970 --> 03:22:12.700
SAM: "What the fuck are you doing there?"

4795
03:22:12.700 --> 03:22:15.010
LAURA: Are you still at his house?

4796
03:22:15.010 --> 03:22:16.930
MATT: "No, no, I've returned to Tal'Dorei.

4797
03:22:16.930 --> 03:22:18.690
"There are many things I am tending to.

4798
03:22:18.690 --> 03:22:19.860
"This is just one of them."

4799
03:22:19.860 --> 03:22:22.135
LAURA: What are you doing right now?

4800
03:22:24.604 --> 03:22:27.250
MATT: "Do you really want me to go into it?"

4801
03:22:27.250 --> 03:22:30.100
SAM: What's Tal'Dorei?
LAURA: It's another continent.

4802
03:22:30.100 --> 03:22:34.170
MATT: "We're fine. I'm dealing with political business,

4803
03:22:34.170 --> 03:22:36.027
"and trying to--"

4804
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:39.050
LAURA: I'm trying to look around and see where she is.

4805
03:22:39.050 --> 03:22:43.300
MATT: She begins to move it away, showing--

4806
03:22:43.300 --> 03:22:46.080
"Nevertheless, please do keep me updated.

4807
03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:48.200
"When you are deciding to return,

4808
03:22:50.430 --> 03:22:52.170
"just go ahead and notify me and I'll meet you back

4809
03:22:52.170 --> 03:22:54.428
"at the tower."
LAURA: Okay.

4810
03:22:56.340 --> 03:22:58.650
MATT: "Everything else all right?"

4811
03:22:58.650 --> 03:22:59.600
LAURA: Yeah, it's a real--

4812
03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:02.917
LIAM: It's very difficult in here.
You were right to stay out.

4813
03:23:02.917 --> 03:23:04.400
MATT: "I assumed it was--"

4814
03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:05.870
LAURA: It's like everything here is made

4815
03:23:05.870 --> 03:23:09.060
to where you get punished if you use magic.

4816
03:23:09.060 --> 03:23:10.570
MATT: "Sounds about right, yes."

4817
03:23:10.570 --> 03:23:13.430
TRAVIS: Does she have any cure-all's against golems?

4818
03:23:13.430 --> 03:23:16.230
LAURA: Yeah, the golems that seem to absorb flame

4819
03:23:16.230 --> 03:23:18.310
and also will Dispel Magic and make it

4820
03:23:18.310 --> 03:23:19.926
to where we can't do magic--

4821
03:23:19.926 --> 03:23:24.926
MATT: "There actually is one kind of secret
failsafe to these entities.

4822
03:23:25.118 --> 03:23:27.618
"I would recommend staying away."

4823
03:23:27.618 --> 03:23:28.530
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Oh.

4824
03:23:28.530 --> 03:23:29.410
TRAVIS: That's very funny.

4825
03:23:29.410 --> 03:23:31.130
MARISHA: She used that one like a week ago.

4826
03:23:31.130 --> 03:23:32.490
TRAVIS: Ha, ha, Tal'Dorei humor.

4827
03:23:32.490 --> 03:23:34.867
LAURA: We tried that one. It didn't work, though.

4828
03:23:35.961 --> 03:23:37.807
MATT: "It doesn't always work."

4829
03:23:37.807 --> 03:23:38.923
LAURA: Anything else?

4830
03:23:38.923 --> 03:23:40.810
SAM: I mean, if she hears about any goings

4831
03:23:40.810 --> 03:23:42.940
on in the Empire or the Dynasty--

4832
03:23:42.940 --> 03:23:45.203
LAURA: Then just send me a message or something.
SAM: Let us know.

4833
03:23:45.203 --> 03:23:47.020
LAURA: I have this thing where I can send a message

4834
03:23:47.020 --> 03:23:50.390
to you any time at all, so if you have that,

4835
03:23:50.390 --> 03:23:52.130
if you can do that because you're pretty powerful,

4836
03:23:52.130 --> 03:23:54.893
I think, if you can do that,
you can just do that for us--

4837
03:23:54.893 --> 03:23:56.410
SAM: I'm sure you have stuff on Tal'Dorei,

4838
03:23:56.410 --> 03:23:59.190
but Wildemount is the most important continent

4839
03:23:59.190 --> 03:24:01.880
in the world, as we all know, so just let us know

4840
03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:03.890
what's going on there.

4841
03:24:03.890 --> 03:24:06.323
MATT: "It is a curious one, certainly.

4842
03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:10.990
"I have some worrisome thoughts

4843
03:24:10.990 --> 03:24:12.480
"about some of the things you mentioned

4844
03:24:12.480 --> 03:24:17.105
"about this Angel, but I think

4845
03:24:17.105 --> 03:24:21.850
"I need your assistance to confirm some of these things,

4846
03:24:21.850 --> 03:24:25.212
"as well as, I think I mentioned some sort of,

4847
03:24:27.751 --> 03:24:31.290
"I would say affects of this friend of yours you mentioned."

4848
03:24:31.290 --> 03:24:32.710
TRAVIS: Yasha.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4849
03:24:32.710 --> 03:24:34.280
MATT: "Something--something to connect with,

4850
03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:38.992
"something to pull the information as an anchor from, but

4851
03:24:40.230 --> 03:24:42.650
"just tell me when you return, and we'll go over this."

4852
03:24:42.650 --> 03:24:44.050
LAURA: All right.

4853
03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:47.800
Okay, well, we're going to try not to die some more.

4854
03:24:47.800 --> 03:24:50.170
MATT: "Please continue that, I
would really appreciate that."

4855
03:24:50.170 --> 03:24:51.970
LAURA: Okay, anything else--

4856
03:24:51.970 --> 03:24:53.670
MARISHA: Does she want a souvenir or something?

4857
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:54.810
LAURA: Do you want us to grab anything for you?

4858
03:24:54.810 --> 03:24:57.517
MARISHA: Yeah, hey, look, I've got
a new braid wrap, she put it in--

4859
03:24:57.517 --> 03:24:59.084
LAURA: Look, look, look, look. Do you see it, it's cool--

4860
03:24:59.084 --> 03:25:01.560
MARISHA: It made me all smart and shit.

4861
03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:03.130
LIAM: Clearly.
MATT: "I do know

4862
03:25:03.130 --> 03:25:04.740
"exactly what such a device is,

4863
03:25:04.740 --> 03:25:07.760
"and yes, if you see anything else like that, please,

4864
03:25:07.760 --> 03:25:09.790
"I would not be against taking it into my--"

4865
03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:11.530
LAURA: This is my wand.

4866
03:25:11.530 --> 03:25:13.260
We found a wa-- what?

4867
03:25:13.260 --> 03:25:15.310
LIAM: Ask her if there's any news of the war.

4868
03:25:15.310 --> 03:25:17.585
LAURA: (whispers) Is there any news of the war?

4869
03:25:19.783 --> 03:25:21.130
MATT: "Yes.

4870
03:25:23.170 --> 03:25:27.760
"There has been a series of attacks on some

4871
03:25:27.760 --> 03:25:29.375
"of the military...

4872
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:34.350
"siege installations within the empire.

4873
03:25:34.350 --> 03:25:36.245
"There was an assault on some

4874
03:25:36.245 --> 03:25:40.503
"of the weapon creation factories in Hupperdook."

4875
03:25:40.503 --> 03:25:42.394
LAURA: (gasps)

4876
03:25:44.393 --> 03:25:47.300
"In the middle of the night--"
LAURA: When, how many days ago?

4877
03:25:47.300 --> 03:25:49.750
MATT: "This was about four days ago,

4878
03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:53.760
"as well as a counter assault by the empire within Xhorhas.

4879
03:25:53.760 --> 03:25:57.440
"There was an attempted retaking of the Ashguard Garrison

4880
03:25:57.440 --> 03:26:02.440
"that seemed successful, though at the loss of many lives,

4881
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:05.860
"bringing it back to the central point,

4882
03:26:05.860 --> 03:26:07.240
"but that's as much as I've gleaned

4883
03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:10.160
"from information that's come in just these past few days.

4884
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:13.040
"I will say...

4885
03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:17.785
"this conflict is troubling.

4886
03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:21.000
"And I'm sorry."

4887
03:26:22.017 --> 03:26:22.850
LAURA: Yeah.

4888
03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:26.370
Thank you for letting us know.

4889
03:26:26.370 --> 03:26:27.590
MATT: "Of course."

4890
03:26:29.580 --> 03:26:30.960
SAM: Talk to you in a while.

4891
03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:32.520
LAURA: Yeah.

4892
03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:33.560
SAM: Just hit the button.

4893
03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:35.460
LAURA: No, I don't want--
SAM: Hit the button.

4894
03:26:35.460 --> 03:26:38.060
MARISHA: Sometimes you have to double--
yeah, it gets weird, there you go.

4895
03:26:38.060 --> 03:26:39.848
TALIESIN: No, that's just in text, now you've got to--

4896
03:26:39.848 --> 03:26:41.823
LAURA: It's gone, she's gone.

4897
03:26:43.198 --> 03:26:44.710
TRAVIS: Hupperdook.

4898
03:26:44.710 --> 03:26:47.060
LAURA: That's where Kiri is, you guys.

4899
03:26:47.060 --> 03:26:48.838
SAM: Was.
LAURA: (horrified gasp)

4900
03:26:48.838 --> 03:26:52.000
SAM: I'm just kidding, no! Sometimes I make jokes

4901
03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:55.610
when I'm nervous. I want Kiri to live.

4902
03:26:55.610 --> 03:26:59.638
MARISHA: I'm sure Kiri's fine.
Those kids knew how to lay low.

4903
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:03.120
LIAM: Well, the days are flying by on the other side.

4904
03:27:03.120 --> 03:27:06.433
Why don't we exit this place?

4905
03:27:06.433 --> 03:27:08.153
LAURA: All right.
LIAM: Go out the tower.

4906
03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:10.740
LAURA: Okay.

4907
03:27:10.740 --> 03:27:12.015
MATT: All right.

4908
03:27:13.049 --> 03:27:16.780
So you gather your things and...?

4909
03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:19.810
SAM and LIAM: Head out the door.

4910
03:27:19.810 --> 03:27:21.870
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Look, like--

4911
03:27:21.870 --> 03:27:25.020
MATT: How are you traversing the central trap?

4912
03:27:25.020 --> 03:27:26.760
LIAM: Are we on-- we're still on that little island

4913
03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:28.060
on the other side of the door?

4914
03:27:28.060 --> 03:27:29.440
TALIESIN and SAM: No.
LIAM: No?

4915
03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:32.013
MATT: You guys slept between the two--

4916
03:27:32.013 --> 03:27:33.480
LAURA: Yeah, we're going to,

4917
03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:35.720
we're going to move--
MATT: Arcane cannons.

4918
03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:38.010
LAURA: We're going to push them to where--

4919
03:27:38.010 --> 03:27:39.780
pointing towards the walls.

4920
03:27:39.780 --> 03:27:41.220
TALIESIN: Maybe you could deactivate them.

4921
03:27:41.220 --> 03:27:42.840
LIAM: Sorry, I meant, once we're through that door,

4922
03:27:42.840 --> 03:27:44.590
though, it's on a chunk of rock, floating in space?

4923
03:27:44.590 --> 03:27:46.220
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Correct.

4924
03:27:46.220 --> 03:27:47.640
SAM: I can try to deactivate them,

4925
03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:49.420
or we can just leave them and--

4926
03:27:49.420 --> 03:27:51.360
TRAVIS: Yeah, try and deactivate them

4927
03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:52.870
so we can get across the floor.

4928
03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:54.200
LAURA: That's what I'm saying--
SAM: Or we could just jump.

4929
03:27:54.200 --> 03:27:56.130
LAURA: Why can't we just point them towards the wall--

4930
03:27:56.130 --> 03:27:57.662
TRAVIS: I think if you-- I think--

4931
03:27:57.662 --> 03:28:00.036
MARISHA: Because if you touch, they'll like--

4932
03:28:00.036 --> 03:28:00.869
LAURA: Oh.

4933
03:28:00.869 --> 03:28:03.660
LIAM: Well, that is easily-- we can test that.

4934
03:28:03.660 --> 03:28:07.020
Turn them away and throw a thing onto the pressure sensor.

4935
03:28:07.020 --> 03:28:08.186
TALIESIN: All right.

4936
03:28:09.340 --> 03:28:11.593
MATT: Okay, you both turn them and face away?
LIAM: Aim them away.

4937
03:28:11.593 --> 03:28:13.822
MATT: You throw a piece of wood.
SAM: The bone of--

4938
03:28:15.230 --> 03:28:16.910
MATT: You see one shoots

4939
03:28:16.910 --> 03:28:20.123
this massive fireball-familiar explosion
in the center there,

4940
03:28:20.123 --> 03:28:22.123
and the other one releases a 60 foot cone

4941
03:28:22.123 --> 03:28:25.170
of poisonous gas that billows out and fills the area,

4942
03:28:25.170 --> 03:28:26.330
that slowly dissipates.

4943
03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:29.060
TRAVIS: Just an idea, we still need to be flying creatures

4944
03:28:29.060 --> 03:28:30.800
to get off of the floating rock

4945
03:28:30.800 --> 03:28:33.330
and over to the main area, right?
SAM: So we should just do that now.

4946
03:28:33.330 --> 03:28:35.870
MATT: You do know, just because of your search earlier,

4947
03:28:35.870 --> 03:28:38.130
that there are these connections

4948
03:28:38.130 --> 03:28:39.680
at the bases of these that are feeding them

4949
03:28:39.680 --> 03:28:42.470
with continuous overcharge of arcane power.

4950
03:28:42.470 --> 03:28:43.885
If they were disconnected,

4951
03:28:43.885 --> 03:28:46.670
they would have a five minute recharge time per shot.

4952
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:49.200
SAM: Should I try it?

4953
03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:50.509
LIAM: Yes, you should.

4954
03:28:50.509 --> 03:28:52.290
MARISHA: Is it going to explode in your face if you fail?

4955
03:28:52.290 --> 03:28:54.020
SAM: Probably.
LAURA: Everybody step back.

4956
03:28:54.020 --> 03:28:56.212
TRAVIS: It's just Nott, it'll be fine.

4957
03:28:57.270 --> 03:29:00.090
SAM: All right, back up.

4958
03:29:00.090 --> 03:29:02.233
TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: Guidance.

4959
03:29:03.233 --> 03:29:07.284
SAM: Ooh.
TRAVIS: Come on, no, no. (laughs)

4960
03:29:07.284 --> 03:29:08.910
SAM: Ooh. But with--

4961
03:29:08.910 --> 03:29:11.410
but with Guidance, what am I doing, what am I trying?

4962
03:29:11.410 --> 03:29:14.950
MATT: This would be an investigation, well,

4963
03:29:14.950 --> 03:29:16.650
no, this is to disable, right?

4964
03:29:16.650 --> 03:29:18.040
So it'd be dexterity.

4965
03:29:18.040 --> 03:29:20.220
SAM: Just simple dexterity check?

4966
03:29:20.220 --> 03:29:22.050
MATT: With thieves tools to try and disable it,

4967
03:29:22.050 --> 03:29:23.100
so add your proficiency bonus.

4968
03:29:23.100 --> 03:29:26.990
SAM: 17.
MATT: 17?

4969
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:29.840
You have enough to disable, to disconnect two

4970
03:29:29.840 --> 03:29:30.970
of them, but they're not disabled.

4971
03:29:30.970 --> 03:29:32.750
You disconnect them from their arcane power source,

4972
03:29:32.750 --> 03:29:33.690
but you haven't shut them down.

4973
03:29:33.690 --> 03:29:36.180
LAURA: Okay, so I'll throw another plank of wood.

4974
03:29:36.180 --> 03:29:39.330
MATT: They both explode this time, two simultaneous,

4975
03:29:39.330 --> 03:29:41.520
it looks like they randomize whatever they fire

4976
03:29:41.520 --> 03:29:44.110
when nobody's giving them specific presses.

4977
03:29:44.110 --> 03:29:45.960
So the types of energy being released

4978
03:29:45.960 --> 03:29:48.054
in attacks are varying with each shot.

4979
03:29:48.054 --> 03:29:49.650
(overlapping chatter)

4980
03:29:49.650 --> 03:29:52.504
LIAM: And throw another chunk immediately.

4981
03:29:52.504 --> 03:29:54.029
TALIESIN: All right, let's go.

4982
03:29:54.029 --> 03:29:57.890
MATT: And you can see the sigils slowly building up.

4983
03:29:57.890 --> 03:29:59.290
All right, you guys go ahead and run across.

4984
03:29:59.290 --> 03:30:01.350
LAURA: I'm going to meander.

4985
03:30:01.350 --> 03:30:03.220
MATT: As you saunter across without issue,

4986
03:30:03.220 --> 03:30:06.510
hearing quiet music, you get your little hip walk on.

4987
03:30:06.510 --> 03:30:08.160
TALIESIN and LAURA: ♪ (Limbo) ♪

4988
03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:10.790
MATT: Make your way to the opposite end
where the open doors--

4989
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:14.190
there's the same familiar purple shimmer through.

4990
03:30:14.190 --> 03:30:15.970
As you step out, you are once more

4991
03:30:15.970 --> 03:30:19.190
on this floating island, on the outside

4992
03:30:19.190 --> 03:30:22.460
of the giant bent tower, the purplish flashes

4993
03:30:22.460 --> 03:30:25.690
of distant lightning, and this swirly maelstrom,

4994
03:30:25.690 --> 03:30:29.280
still present, still dangerous, ominous.

4995
03:30:30.990 --> 03:30:31.823
MARISHA: Cool.

4996
03:30:33.868 --> 03:30:35.420
TRAVIS: Are we in generally the same area?

4997
03:30:35.420 --> 03:30:37.730
Can we see the sort of charging posts?

4998
03:30:37.730 --> 03:30:39.720
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

4999
03:30:39.720 --> 03:30:43.200
MATT: It seems like this is a consistent rotation,

5000
03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:45.080
so yes, you don't see them at first,

5001
03:30:45.080 --> 03:30:46.990
but about three or four minutes later,

5002
03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:49.290
you start to see the edge of that lip

5003
03:30:49.290 --> 03:30:50.500
where you guys were at, and you can see it,

5004
03:30:50.500 --> 03:30:52.010
there's another section of false stop

5005
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:55.070
that ends a little ways down from where you lept over

5006
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:57.150
and made your way to this platform originally.

5007
03:30:58.598 --> 03:31:00.330
SAM: Do we get the sense that if we stayed

5008
03:31:00.330 --> 03:31:02.170
on this thing for a while, we could get around

5009
03:31:02.170 --> 03:31:05.820
and skip the gears?
MARISHA: And, yeah.

5010
03:31:05.820 --> 03:31:08.630
MATT: It would be a high, so it is a slow rotation down.

5011
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:09.880
SAM: Oh, it goes down, like.

5012
03:31:09.880 --> 03:31:12.580
MATT: Yeah, the lip of the tower continues down this way

5013
03:31:12.580 --> 03:31:14.690
as a spiral, while the platform just rotates

5014
03:31:14.690 --> 03:31:16.178
in a consistent orbit.

5015
03:31:16.178 --> 03:31:18.660
LIAM: I have a knack for changing shape,

5016
03:31:18.660 --> 03:31:23.240
and I could ferry us up past the gears, just me.

5017
03:31:23.240 --> 03:31:24.500
LAURA: Oh yeah, so it doesn't waste a spell?

5018
03:31:24.500 --> 03:31:26.190
LIAM: That's correct, it would take a moment,

5019
03:31:26.190 --> 03:31:28.120
or a few moments.
LAURA: I like it.

5020
03:31:28.120 --> 03:31:30.420
SAM: Just remember, it's difficult

5021
03:31:30.420 --> 03:31:32.200
to fly once you get further away from the tower.

5022
03:31:32.200 --> 03:31:33.590
LAURA: I don't know if you experienced it, but yeah,

5023
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:35.156
it's kind of a thing.
LIAM: But we're not in a rush,

5024
03:31:35.156 --> 03:31:37.122
so we can really take it slow.

5025
03:31:37.122 --> 03:31:38.690
SAM: Okay.

5026
03:31:38.690 --> 03:31:39.840
LIAM: Giant eagle.
MATT: Okay.

5027
03:31:41.100 --> 03:31:42.980
LAURA: I'll go left in case something goes wrong,

5028
03:31:42.980 --> 03:31:47.313
that way I can also transform, so you guys go first.

5029
03:31:47.313 --> 03:31:48.696
MATT: Okay, who are you taking first?

5030
03:31:48.696 --> 03:31:51.340
LIAM: I'll grab Beau and Fjord.

5031
03:31:51.340 --> 03:31:52.610
MATT: All right.
LIAM: (squawks)

5032
03:31:52.610 --> 03:31:54.670
MATT: The eagle grabs you and lifts you up.

5033
03:31:54.670 --> 03:31:56.770
You get about 10, 15 feet off the island

5034
03:31:56.770 --> 03:31:59.370
before the gravity shifts a bit, and you have to adjust.

5035
03:31:59.370 --> 03:32:01.600
You guys feel your feet get tugged

5036
03:32:01.600 --> 03:32:02.433
to the side.

5037
03:32:04.557 --> 03:32:07.080
And you begin to make your way closer to the tower.

5038
03:32:07.080 --> 03:32:09.020
As you begin to approach, you can see the gears turning

5039
03:32:09.020 --> 03:32:10.800
in that one section, and as you look across the tower,

5040
03:32:10.800 --> 03:32:12.620
you can see there are multiple areas

5041
03:32:12.620 --> 03:32:16.150
where there's similar stops, where gears break up the lip,

5042
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:18.350
and in many cases, have their own sense of danger,

5043
03:32:18.350 --> 03:32:20.370
and whirling blades and chains that are being pulled

5044
03:32:20.370 --> 03:32:21.430
through on pulleys.

5045
03:32:21.430 --> 03:32:23.660
LIAM: How difficult would it be just to get them up close

5046
03:32:23.660 --> 03:32:25.180
to that door that I spotted--
MATT: To the door,

5047
03:32:25.180 --> 03:32:26.880
not terribly difficult, it looks like.

5048
03:32:26.880 --> 03:32:27.720
LIAM: That's what we'll do.

5049
03:32:27.720 --> 03:32:29.820
MATT: Okay, so you bypass the entrance doorway

5050
03:32:29.820 --> 03:32:32.520
that you guys came through, continue upward,

5051
03:32:32.520 --> 03:32:36.290
towards that slight green glowing frame

5052
03:32:36.290 --> 03:32:38.730
that is central to the one door you guys saw

5053
03:32:38.730 --> 03:32:41.410
when you first exited into the tower machine.

5054
03:32:42.390 --> 03:32:43.750
As you make your way up towards that door,

5055
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:45.140
you can see it closed.

5056
03:32:48.940 --> 03:32:50.090
For this one.

5057
03:32:53.550 --> 03:32:55.160
Right, so you go to the green-blue doorway.

5058
03:32:55.160 --> 03:32:56.660
As you come up to it, it's on one of the lips there,

5059
03:32:56.660 --> 03:33:00.420
at the slight incline, you can drop them both off at it,

5060
03:33:00.420 --> 03:33:04.360
and it's just a normal brown wooden door,

5061
03:33:04.360 --> 03:33:07.610
just that slight faint glow to the outer arch.

5062
03:33:07.610 --> 03:33:11.050
LIAM: Okay, so Caleb screeches, and then starts

5063
03:33:11.050 --> 03:33:13.600
to carefully fly his way back down.

5064
03:33:13.600 --> 03:33:14.982
TRAVIS: Let's go.

5065
03:33:14.982 --> 03:33:16.560
MATT: It keeps shifting as you get in certain directions,

5066
03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:19.000
it's super discombobulating, but eventually

5067
03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:21.740
you come back, and you can grab who else?

5068
03:33:21.740 --> 03:33:22.740
LIAM: Caduceus and Nott.

5069
03:33:22.740 --> 03:33:24.870
MATT: All right, grab them, bring them back.

5070
03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:26.883
SAM: Jester, I'm sorry.

5071
03:33:27.858 --> 03:33:31.100
(laughter)

5072
03:33:31.100 --> 03:33:32.433
LAURA: Oh no.

5073
03:33:32.433 --> 03:33:33.708
MARISHA: It's happening again.

5074
03:33:33.708 --> 03:33:36.290
(laughter)

5075
03:33:36.290 --> 03:33:37.760
MATT: Easy enough, you manage to get the whole party up

5076
03:33:37.760 --> 03:33:39.640
to that lip, up to the door, it's still closed

5077
03:33:39.640 --> 03:33:40.900
in front of you, and you guys wait.

5078
03:33:40.900 --> 03:33:44.730
Eventually, about, it takes about, I'd say 25 minutes

5079
03:33:44.730 --> 03:33:46.709
or so to do it carefully with the constant shifting,

5080
03:33:46.709 --> 03:33:49.340
heavy winds, and the flashes of light in the storm,

5081
03:33:49.340 --> 03:33:51.420
and just being careful, but you do manage

5082
03:33:51.420 --> 03:33:54.090
to get the entire party up at the next door.

5083
03:33:54.090 --> 03:33:54.923
LIAM: Okay.

5084
03:33:56.270 --> 03:33:59.496
Don't change yet. Watching the group. (squawks)

5085
03:34:02.190 --> 03:34:03.451
MARISHA: You know, the concept of

5086
03:34:03.451 --> 03:34:05.542
gravity was first discovered

5087
03:34:05.542 --> 03:34:09.083
by a Xhorhasian wizard known as

5088
03:34:09.083 --> 03:34:11.225
Iz-aak New-ton.

5089
03:34:11.225 --> 03:34:13.093
SAM: Oof.
TRAVIS: Are you making this up?

5090
03:34:13.093 --> 03:34:15.720
SAM: No, she's a nerd now.

5091
03:34:15.720 --> 03:34:17.750
LAURA: You're so smart with that circlet, Beau.

5092
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:19.580
MARISHA: I know! I feel like the thoughts have

5093
03:34:19.580 --> 03:34:22.070
always been there, but they're just so easy to recall now.

5094
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:24.840
TRAVIS: Is the jewel near your forehead?

5095
03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:26.480
MARISHA: It's right here, kind of in the part,

5096
03:34:26.480 --> 03:34:30.210
you can kind of-- Ow! Ow, why?

5097
03:34:30.210 --> 03:34:33.876
LIAM: It's like Homer finally taking
the crayon out of the package.

5098
03:34:33.876 --> 03:34:37.776
(laughter)

5099
03:34:38.780 --> 03:34:43.031
Have we, forgive me, I was confused.

5100
03:34:43.031 --> 03:34:45.280
Have we circumvented the gears?

5101
03:34:45.280 --> 03:34:46.240
TRAVIS, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Yes.

5102
03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:47.890
SAM: All right, so it's just up, up, and away, then.

5103
03:34:47.890 --> 03:34:49.550
LAURA: Yeah, we're right in front of the door now.

5104
03:34:49.550 --> 03:34:51.875
SAM: Well, then, let's go.
TALIESIN: All right.

5105
03:34:51.875 --> 03:34:53.166
SAM: I mean, there's no other doors, right?

5106
03:34:53.166 --> 03:34:55.440
TRAVIS: Yeah, we go through.
TALIESIN: We go through.

5107
03:34:55.440 --> 03:34:56.273
MATT: The door opens.

5108
03:34:56.273 --> 03:34:57.310
SAM: Oh, it's a swinging door?

5109
03:34:57.310 --> 03:34:58.850
MATT: It's a swinging door, it opens up,

5110
03:34:58.850 --> 03:35:00.400
it's a normal wooden door.

5111
03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:01.233
What's up?

5112
03:35:01.233 --> 03:35:02.220
TRAVIS: Was there a lock under the handle?

5113
03:35:02.220 --> 03:35:04.320
MATT: There was no lock.
SAM: Is there a keyhole?

5114
03:35:04.320 --> 03:35:06.470
MATT: There is no keyhole.
LIAM: Is there a chair?

5115
03:35:08.350 --> 03:35:10.970
MATT: Roll a perception-- nah.

5116
03:35:10.970 --> 03:35:12.630
The door just swings open, and as it does,

5117
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:15.720
the door leads into a black expanse

5118
03:35:15.720 --> 03:35:18.347
with a very faint point of light.

5119
03:35:20.820 --> 03:35:22.840
SAM: Just to a void, a black void?

5120
03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:25.410
MATT: A black void with a point of light.

5121
03:35:25.410 --> 03:35:27.750
SAM: I'll just gingerly tiptoe out

5122
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:30.340
to see if there's a floor.
MATT: Okay, you tiptoe out,

5123
03:35:30.340 --> 03:35:31.600
and as soon as your foot gets out there,

5124
03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:34.640
there's no floor, and you get pulled in.

5125
03:35:34.640 --> 03:35:35.473
TALIESIN: Here we go.

5126
03:35:35.473 --> 03:35:37.320
MATT: Nott just vanishes into the darkness.

5127
03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:39.790
TRAVIS: Amazing. I run after her.

5128
03:35:39.790 --> 03:35:40.623
TRAVIS: Fjord's gone.

5129
03:35:40.623 --> 03:35:42.420
TALIESIN: I hate all of this, jumping in.

5130
03:35:42.420 --> 03:35:45.300
MATT: You all, one after the other, dive into this void,

5131
03:35:45.300 --> 03:35:47.290
and you feel like you're being pulled through

5132
03:35:47.290 --> 03:35:49.660
at near-light speed. There's no wind,

5133
03:35:49.660 --> 03:35:52.360
just that white point of light going,

5134
03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:56.330
and opening like a rapid-paced reverse

5135
03:35:56.330 --> 03:35:59.000
of the end of a Looney Toons cartoon, just.

5136
03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:02.230
As it arrives, you are pushed out of it

5137
03:36:02.230 --> 03:36:04.950
at a side angle once more, and then adjust

5138
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:06.960
to gravity, which is no on the right side.

5139
03:36:06.960 --> 03:36:08.720
You land on your side, and then it takes a moment

5140
03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:11.460
to realize that you've come out at an odd angle,

5141
03:36:11.460 --> 03:36:13.838
and the ceiling is now up above you.

5142
03:36:13.838 --> 03:36:16.870
LIAM: (wings flapping)

5143
03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:18.320
TALIESIN: Everything about this is terrible.

5144
03:36:18.320 --> 03:36:21.131
MATT: You have to squeeze through that door.

5145
03:36:21.131 --> 03:36:22.870
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

5146
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:24.620
TRAVIS: There's feathers everywhere.

5147
03:36:25.920 --> 03:36:29.020
You guys now sit within a somewhat rounded chamber.

5148
03:36:29.020 --> 03:36:32.030
It seems square like, but the corners are rounded.

5149
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:35.240
It is a cluttered workshop of some kind,

5150
03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:38.630
with all sorts of implements for carving,

5151
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:41.630
chiseling, molding, bending.

5152
03:36:41.630 --> 03:36:44.940
You can see numerous granite tables at different sides,

5153
03:36:44.940 --> 03:36:48.130
there's four of them facing each other

5154
03:36:48.130 --> 03:36:49.540
from an open center, where in the middle

5155
03:36:49.540 --> 03:36:51.420
of the floor, it looks like a big stone slab

5156
03:36:51.420 --> 03:36:55.030
with a bunch of dull carvings in it.

5157
03:36:56.600 --> 03:36:58.470
You can see large boxes containing raw

5158
03:36:58.470 --> 03:37:00.720
and partially smooth stone boulders resting

5159
03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:05.173
at one of the corners, just a large pile of rough stone.

5160
03:37:06.090 --> 03:37:08.230
You can see ingots of dark green metal sitting

5161
03:37:08.230 --> 03:37:10.870
near a rune-encrusted anvil that sits

5162
03:37:10.870 --> 03:37:12.520
to the right side of the chamber,

5163
03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:16.830
right at the foot of a blue-flamed forge

5164
03:37:16.830 --> 03:37:20.480
that just has blue fire burning inside of it.

5165
03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:24.063
In front of that forge

5166
03:37:24.063 --> 03:37:28.138
is a massive green metal golem,

5167
03:37:28.138 --> 03:37:31.120
standing about 12 feet tall,

5168
03:37:31.120 --> 03:37:34.190
made from the same material as the ingots,

5169
03:37:34.190 --> 03:37:37.480
one arm ending in a long set of hooked tongs,

5170
03:37:37.480 --> 03:37:40.240
and the other in a deadly looking hammer,

5171
03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:43.200
just standing over the anvil, unmoving.

5172
03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:44.675
LIAM: It's kryptonite.

5173
03:37:45.715 --> 03:37:48.387
MATT: What do you guys want to do?

5174
03:37:48.387 --> 03:37:51.000
TALIESIN: Not touch anything.

5175
03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:52.650
LIAM: Don't touch the residuum golem.

5176
03:37:54.140 --> 03:37:56.870
MARISHA: Can't we try and sneak by--

5177
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:58.940
MATT: It's not residuum,
but you have seen this material before.

5178
03:37:58.940 --> 03:38:00.480
LAURA: What is it?
MATT: You saw the same material

5179
03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:05.080
as the heavy door that was guarding the underground temple

5180
03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:08.380
that you went to with Yasha. It's adamantine.

5181
03:38:08.380 --> 03:38:09.545
LIAM: Oh, I gotcha, I gotcha, gotcha.

5182
03:38:09.545 --> 03:38:10.660
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh.

5183
03:38:10.660 --> 03:38:12.260
TRAVIS: Aside from the green golem,

5184
03:38:12.260 --> 03:38:15.510
are there any other forms, humanoids, figures?

5185
03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:18.450
MATT: You look, and in the corners of the chambers,

5186
03:38:18.450 --> 03:38:20.370
you can see other partially constructed golems

5187
03:38:20.370 --> 03:38:23.630
and bits and pieces of raw golem material.

5188
03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:25.630
Like this is literally a golem workshop.

5189
03:38:26.480 --> 03:38:29.490
TALIESIN: Is there another door?
LAURA: There is somewhere.

5190
03:38:30.470 --> 03:38:32.690
MATT: Yes, there is, across the way.

5191
03:38:32.690 --> 03:38:33.640
MARISHA: Behind the forge.

5192
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:40.920
MATT: Let's see here. First, make a perception check for me.

5193
03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:41.753
MARISHA: Who?

5194
03:38:41.753 --> 03:38:42.950
TALIESIN: One thing I could really do.

5195
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:45.589
MATT: Or actually, no, sorry, investigation or arcana.

5196
03:38:45.589 --> 03:38:48.190
LAURA: (laughs) Guidance. Shit.

5197
03:38:48.190 --> 03:38:49.712
MATT: With you, it's perception because you're just looking

5198
03:38:49.712 --> 03:38:52.780
for another door, go ahead.
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you, 22.

5199
03:38:52.780 --> 03:38:56.290
MATT: Okay, yeah, across the other way,

5200
03:38:56.290 --> 03:38:59.690
hidden behind some of these big bars of metal

5201
03:38:59.690 --> 03:39:03.260
that are still raw and unused, you see

5202
03:39:03.260 --> 03:39:05.220
just a simple gray door that seems

5203
03:39:05.220 --> 03:39:06.920
to blend in with the rest of the wall.

5204
03:39:06.920 --> 03:39:08.620
TALIESIN: It's not open?
MATT: It's not open.

5205
03:39:10.430 --> 03:39:12.148
MARISHA: Does it look glowy?

5206
03:39:12.148 --> 03:39:13.860
TALIESIN: It doesn't look glowy, I also would say

5207
03:39:13.860 --> 03:39:17.600
that we should, every time we do anything magic,

5208
03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:19.460
even the slightest magic--

5209
03:39:19.460 --> 03:39:23.160
LIAM: I drop the eagle form.
TALIESIN: No Guidance, no nothing.

5210
03:39:23.160 --> 03:39:25.440
LIAM: Were there any, did you say there were runes over

5211
03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:27.680
what he just found, or?

5212
03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:28.820
MATT: You can see in the middle of the floor,

5213
03:39:28.820 --> 03:39:31.600
there's like a series of runes

5214
03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:34.710
on a large, heavy 10-foot wide stone tablet.

5215
03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:36.910
There's books and papers and shit

5216
03:39:36.910 --> 03:39:38.400
on some of the granite tables out there,

5217
03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:40.560
along with materials and tools.

5218
03:39:42.430 --> 03:39:44.760
LIAM: I'm going to examine the floor,

5219
03:39:44.760 --> 03:39:45.920
and the arcane symbols on the floor

5220
03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:48.390
and see if I can understand them, and what they might mean.

5221
03:39:48.390 --> 03:39:50.042
MATT: Make an arcana check.

5222
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:55.030
LIAM: I'm going to say it's cocked, it wasn't super cocked,

5223
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:57.330
but it was cocked, that's better.

5224
03:39:57.330 --> 03:39:58.360
MATT: I trust.

5225
03:39:58.360 --> 03:39:59.810
LIAM: It was cocked.
MATT: I trust.

5226
03:40:01.460 --> 03:40:02.480
LIAM: 22.

5227
03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:03.313
MATT: 22?

5228
03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:06.470
Almost, almost.

5229
03:40:07.711 --> 03:40:09.980
The basis of this is heavy enchantment.

5230
03:40:11.020 --> 03:40:13.950
Glancing at the materials here in the books,

5231
03:40:13.950 --> 03:40:18.675
there are the materials here to make a golem.

5232
03:40:20.478 --> 03:40:21.678
LIAM: Okay.

5233
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:25.490
And you found the door already, while I was--

5234
03:40:25.490 --> 03:40:26.720
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've already pointed it out,

5235
03:40:26.720 --> 03:40:29.740
and I've also made a little speech about magic,

5236
03:40:29.740 --> 03:40:31.958
and how maybe we should be careful.

5237
03:40:31.958 --> 03:40:33.330
LIAM: All right.

5238
03:40:33.330 --> 03:40:34.450
TALIESIN: Even the slightest--

5239
03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:38.900
LIAM: Is there anything arcane in nature about the door?

5240
03:40:38.900 --> 03:40:40.520
MATT: The door you just came through?

5241
03:40:40.520 --> 03:40:42.941
LIAM: The door that Caduceus found.

5242
03:40:42.941 --> 03:40:44.600
MATT: Not that is visually there,

5243
03:40:44.600 --> 03:40:46.360
it looks pretty plain, enclosed.

5244
03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:48.340
TALIESIN: Check for traps, maybe?

5245
03:40:48.340 --> 03:40:50.950
MARISHA: It's a circular room,

5246
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:52.730
do we want to do a perimeter sweep?

5247
03:40:52.730 --> 03:40:55.170
TALIESIN: I think we just gently walk,

5248
03:40:55.170 --> 03:40:57.450
but check to make sure we don't step on anything.

5249
03:40:57.450 --> 03:41:00.840
MARISHA: Group one and group two, do a perimeter sweep?

5250
03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:04.410
LIAM: We could accidentally turn that on, look around,

5251
03:41:04.410 --> 03:41:06.230
do you see anything?

5252
03:41:06.230 --> 03:41:09.202
SAM: I'm not as smart as Beau, but I'll go look.

5253
03:41:09.202 --> 03:41:11.840
(laughter)

5254
03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:14.490
Beau, you want to take the right circle,

5255
03:41:14.490 --> 03:41:16.350
and I'll take the left circle, and we'll just sort

5256
03:41:16.350 --> 03:41:17.760
of make a pass?

5257
03:41:17.760 --> 03:41:20.680
MARISHA: I will go counterclockwise through this circle.

5258
03:41:20.680 --> 03:41:22.490
MATT: Okay, so you're both going around the chamber?

5259
03:41:22.490 --> 03:41:25.156
What are you doing?
SAM: She is insufferable now.

5260
03:41:25.156 --> 03:41:27.739
(laughter)

5261
03:41:31.461 --> 03:41:33.420
MATT: So what are you guys doing, what are you trying to do?

5262
03:41:33.420 --> 03:41:35.530
SAM: Well, just check for, well, I'm going to check

5263
03:41:35.530 --> 03:41:39.410
for triggering mechanisms.
MATT: Okay.

5264
03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:40.981
What are you looking for?

5265
03:41:40.981 --> 03:41:44.010
MARISHA: In the same way, triggering mechanisms,

5266
03:41:44.010 --> 03:41:46.750
but also doors--
TRAVIS: Pressure plates?

5267
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:47.760
MARISHA: Doors, pressure plates--

5268
03:41:47.760 --> 03:41:49.280
MATT: Make an investigation check, each of you.

5269
03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:51.598
SAM and MARISHA: Slowly.

5270
03:41:53.020 --> 03:41:54.877
SAM: Terrible, 16.

5271
03:41:55.730 --> 03:41:57.020
MARISHA: Is it cocked?

5272
03:41:57.020 --> 03:41:58.920
SAM: I mean that's not a number right now.

5273
03:41:58.920 --> 03:42:00.240
LIAM: It's cocked.

5274
03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:01.840
MATT: Yeah, it's cocked, roll again.

5275
03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:04.910
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah, we have too much dice

5276
03:42:04.910 --> 03:42:05.980
on some of these tables, it's sending them

5277
03:42:05.980 --> 03:42:06.830
cocked on some of the rolls.

5278
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:07.880
MARISHA: 16.

5279
03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:10.090
MATT: Cull, cull the space.

5280
03:42:10.090 --> 03:42:11.770
16 and?
TRAVIS: One set of dice.

5281
03:42:11.770 --> 03:42:13.860
SAM: Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with these people.

5282
03:42:13.860 --> 03:42:15.180
MATT: What'd you roll?

5283
03:42:15.180 --> 03:42:17.490
SAM: 16. What'd I say? Yes.

5284
03:42:17.490 --> 03:42:20.650
MATT: Great, two 16s. As you guys make your way around,

5285
03:42:20.650 --> 03:42:22.440
you don't notice any traps, but you do notice,

5286
03:42:22.440 --> 03:42:26.110
is there are chains with heavy hooks

5287
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:27.770
that are just set up,

5288
03:42:27.770 --> 03:42:29.820
multiple sets of them hung against the walls

5289
03:42:29.820 --> 03:42:33.370
that attach to these long rails that slide back and forth,

5290
03:42:33.370 --> 03:42:36.040
used for carrying and holding large pieces

5291
03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:37.902
of heavy material aloft.

5292
03:42:39.260 --> 03:42:41.200
But nothing that seems to be a trigger mechanism,

5293
03:42:41.200 --> 03:42:43.990
other than things that are designed to maneuver,

5294
03:42:43.990 --> 03:42:46.230
manipulate those chains and other materials

5295
03:42:46.230 --> 03:42:47.600
around the workshop.

5296
03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:49.180
SAM: I mean, we're going to have to figure out

5297
03:42:49.180 --> 03:42:52.450
if this one that's built is alive, right,

5298
03:42:52.450 --> 03:42:54.060
at some point?
LAURA: It's alive.

5299
03:42:54.060 --> 03:42:54.893
TALIESIN: It's alive.

5300
03:42:54.893 --> 03:42:57.433
MARISHA: I would kind of like to not find out if it's alive.

5301
03:42:57.433 --> 03:42:59.025
LAURA: We just go around it, and go on out.

5302
03:42:59.025 --> 03:43:00.570
TRAVIS: Don't touch anything in the shop

5303
03:43:00.570 --> 03:43:02.890
and don't use magic.

5304
03:43:02.890 --> 03:43:05.390
MATT: But what if I could find one of those boots,

5305
03:43:05.390 --> 03:43:07.957
and then I'd have a jet pack, is all I'm saying.

5306
03:43:07.957 --> 03:43:09.080
LAURA: You probably should have done that

5307
03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:11.280
before you melted the last guy.

5308
03:43:11.280 --> 03:43:12.113
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a--

5309
03:43:12.113 --> 03:43:13.550
SAM: Yeah, but there's parts in here,

5310
03:43:13.550 --> 03:43:15.840
I could find a boot.

5311
03:43:15.840 --> 03:43:18.560
MARISHA: But it's not just the boot that makes the jet pack,

5312
03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:19.961
it just--
TALIESIN: The whole thing.

5313
03:43:19.961 --> 03:43:20.794
TRAVIS: You need the arcane--

5314
03:43:20.794 --> 03:43:22.520
SAM: (uncertain sound)

5315
03:43:22.520 --> 03:43:25.840
What is it?

5316
03:43:25.840 --> 03:43:29.550
LIAM: Can I, while they're debating, can I skim--

5317
03:43:29.550 --> 03:43:30.540
you said there are books about it.

5318
03:43:30.540 --> 03:43:31.720
Are there any interesting titles,

5319
03:43:31.720 --> 03:43:33.552
if I take a moment to?

5320
03:43:33.552 --> 03:43:34.850
MATT: Make an investigation check.

5321
03:43:38.090 --> 03:43:40.140
MARISHA: I offered this to you, you can have this knowledge

5322
03:43:40.140 --> 03:43:42.170
if you want it.
LIAM: 27.

5323
03:43:42.170 --> 03:43:46.910
MATT: 27. The books, a lot of it is shorthand notes,

5324
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:49.870
and it looks like a lot of the design elements

5325
03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:51.150
of this are proprietary.

5326
03:43:51.150 --> 03:43:53.650
These aren't long-running instruction manuals,

5327
03:43:53.650 --> 03:43:56.470
these are things that were developed by Halas himself,

5328
03:43:56.470 --> 03:43:59.960
as specifically designed for his,

5329
03:44:01.470 --> 03:44:05.020
his entire construction of the Folding Halls.

5330
03:44:05.020 --> 03:44:07.100
But you get the gist of it quickly,

5331
03:44:07.100 --> 03:44:08.760
and just skimming through,

5332
03:44:09.850 --> 03:44:12.070
the book that lays open, materials that are there are

5333
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:15.278
for specifically creating a

5334
03:44:15.278 --> 03:44:18.267
smaller golem personal servant.

5335
03:44:18.267 --> 03:44:20.840
SAM: That could be fun.

5336
03:44:20.840 --> 03:44:21.780
MARISHA: You already did that once.

5337
03:44:21.780 --> 03:44:24.283
MATT: You glance through and look through.

5338
03:44:25.710 --> 03:44:28.190
Materials are half set up here, it would take maybe

5339
03:44:28.190 --> 03:44:29.810
about three hours to attempt it.

5340
03:44:29.810 --> 03:44:33.280
LIAM: To make a golem servant with this--

5341
03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:34.220
SAM: Who would dote on you.

5342
03:44:34.220 --> 03:44:36.280
LIAM: -- hulking thing in here with us?

5343
03:44:37.560 --> 03:44:39.600
Is it, where is it's, the instructions are

5344
03:44:39.600 --> 03:44:42.630
for a humanoid form, or short little humanoid form?

5345
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:43.890
MATT: Looking at the materials that are on the instructions

5346
03:44:43.890 --> 03:44:46.510
for it, it's humanoid-esque, but it's more like a small,

5347
03:44:46.510 --> 03:44:51.510
squat, yeah, like a maybe about shoulder height.

5348
03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:55.050
LAURA: Adorable, you could have your own little buddy!

5349
03:44:55.050 --> 03:44:57.310
TRAVIS: Until it turns on you and kills you in your sleep.

5350
03:44:57.310 --> 03:44:59.960
MARISHA: Would Frumpkin like it? Would Frumpkin get jealous?

5351
03:45:00.820 --> 03:45:01.653
LIAM: No, it's not a cat.

5352
03:45:01.653 --> 03:45:03.300
MARISHA: Can you build something better than Frumpkin?

5353
03:45:03.300 --> 03:45:05.665
LIAM: Nothing is better than Frumpkin. That's ridiculous.

5354
03:45:05.665 --> 03:45:07.731
I thought that thing made you smarter.

5355
03:45:07.731 --> 03:45:10.051
TRAVIS: (hoots)

5356
03:45:10.051 --> 03:45:12.148
(laughter)

5357
03:45:12.148 --> 03:45:13.780
MARISHA: Smart enough to know that Frumpkin sucks.

5358
03:45:13.780 --> 03:45:17.145
TRAVIS: Should we move on?

5359
03:45:17.145 --> 03:45:19.255
LAURA: We should probably just go through this place.

5360
03:45:19.255 --> 03:45:21.530
TALIESIN: We'll have to come back at some point.

5361
03:45:21.530 --> 03:45:23.220
LAURA: We can ask--
LIAM: It's interesting,

5362
03:45:23.220 --> 03:45:24.710
but that thing could come awake at any moment--

5363
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:26.660
LAURA: I don't want to fight another one of the golems.

5364
03:45:26.660 --> 03:45:27.900
TRAVIS: Let's keep going.

5365
03:45:27.900 --> 03:45:30.620
MARISHA: Hey, how big are these bars, these adamantine bars?

5366
03:45:30.620 --> 03:45:32.630
MATT: The ingots?
MARISHA: The ingots.

5367
03:45:32.630 --> 03:45:35.600
MATT: They're about a foot long and about maybe an inch,

5368
03:45:35.600 --> 03:45:36.433
an inch and a half--

5369
03:45:36.433 --> 03:45:38.330
TRAVIS: Oh, we should fucking take a shit load of those.

5370
03:45:38.330 --> 03:45:39.380
LAURA: We shouldn't pick up anything--

5371
03:45:39.380 --> 03:45:40.213
TALIESIN: Don't think you should touch--

5372
03:45:40.213 --> 03:45:42.770
LAURA: It's going to wake up if we touch them.

5373
03:45:42.770 --> 03:45:45.768
MARISHA: Okay, let's find the door, let's figure out

5374
03:45:45.768 --> 03:45:49.070
the door, and then contemplate scooping ingots.

5375
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:51.300
SAM: How much do they weigh? They must weigh a lot, right?

5376
03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:52.133
LAURA: Probably, but--

5377
03:45:52.133 --> 03:45:54.390
MARISHA: I just know adamantine is worth a fucking--

5378
03:45:54.390 --> 03:45:56.540
TRAVIS: Got a Bag of Holding, doesn't matter.

5379
03:45:56.540 --> 03:45:57.373
I mean, it does, but.

5380
03:45:57.373 --> 03:45:59.728
SAM: But, I mean, if I wanted to Mage Hand one.

5381
03:45:59.728 --> 03:46:02.090
MARISHA: Oh, you could try that.
SAM: Yeah, but that's probably--

5382
03:46:02.090 --> 03:46:03.786
TRAVIS: Open the door, see if the door opens.

5383
03:46:03.786 --> 03:46:06.486
SAM: Can we walk all the way around the other door?

5384
03:46:06.486 --> 03:46:07.600
MATT: You walk all the way around to the other door.

5385
03:46:07.600 --> 03:46:11.587
There is no handle on it. It's just a push door.

5386
03:46:11.587 --> 03:46:14.050
LAURA: It's going to take us to the experiment chamber,

5387
03:46:14.050 --> 03:46:16.580
you guys, oh, god, an experiment chamber--

5388
03:46:16.580 --> 03:46:18.050
SAM: Wait, is there only one way out of this room?

5389
03:46:18.050 --> 03:46:19.690
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

5390
03:46:19.690 --> 03:46:21.300
SAM: Are we going to just leave this room

5391
03:46:21.300 --> 03:46:24.040
without almost dying? Is that a thing that we can do?

5392
03:46:24.040 --> 03:46:26.334
LIAM: Is a thing that we can do.
TRAVIS: We're not touching anything.

5393
03:46:26.334 --> 03:46:29.122
We're not touching anything in the demonic candy shop.

5394
03:46:29.122 --> 03:46:31.030
SAM: I'll just cast one spell real quick.

5395
03:46:31.030 --> 03:46:35.490
TRAVIS: No, the last one chased us all over this place.

5396
03:46:35.490 --> 03:46:38.070
SAM: It just feels like we should, right?

5397
03:46:38.070 --> 03:46:40.410
TRAVIS: I think this is an opportunity to create an ally

5398
03:46:40.410 --> 03:46:41.910
for whatever we're going into next,

5399
03:46:41.910 --> 03:46:43.493
but we also lose time.

5400
03:46:45.090 --> 03:46:47.098
LAURA: Oh, we could make an ally?

5401
03:46:47.970 --> 03:46:49.520
SAM: A golem ally.

5402
03:46:49.520 --> 03:46:51.230
LAURA: Yeah, but we have to fight a golem

5403
03:46:51.230 --> 03:46:54.480
in order to get an ally. I don't think that's very smart.

5404
03:46:54.480 --> 03:46:56.070
SAM: If we could learn how to program it--

5405
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:57.120
TRAVIS: No, I don't think you have to fight him

5406
03:46:57.120 --> 03:46:59.517
if you do it correctly, but if you steal shit--

5407
03:46:59.517 --> 03:47:01.572
MARISHA: If we finish the job.

5408
03:47:01.572 --> 03:47:04.330
LIAM: Without touching the golem, not even going any closer

5409
03:47:04.330 --> 03:47:06.917
to it, can I slowly circle it and try to examine it

5410
03:47:06.917 --> 03:47:10.100
to understand what would wake it up?

5411
03:47:10.100 --> 03:47:11.800
MATT: Make an arcana check.

5412
03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:15.550
LAURA: Natural 20.
LIAM: 16.

5413
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:18.368
MATT: 16?
LIAM: Where's the Guidance?

5414
03:47:18.368 --> 03:47:21.900
LAURA: Take a minute and ask for it!

5415
03:47:21.900 --> 03:47:24.850
MATT: It's hard to gather what triggers it.

5416
03:47:24.850 --> 03:47:27.240
It's standing like it's complete and ready to go.

5417
03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:30.620
It doesn't have any signs of its being wounded,

5418
03:47:30.620 --> 03:47:33.910
damaged, or non-functional.

5419
03:47:33.910 --> 03:47:36.400
It definitely looks like it matches the design

5420
03:47:36.400 --> 03:47:39.508
of the anvil and the forge behind it.

5421
03:47:40.420 --> 03:47:42.430
Its implements that its arms are made

5422
03:47:42.430 --> 03:47:43.740
into definitely seem to be

5423
03:47:43.740 --> 03:47:47.327
that its main purpose is the creation of other golems,

5424
03:47:47.327 --> 03:47:50.110
but you're not sure what,

5425
03:47:50.110 --> 03:47:53.060
if its purpose is extended beyond that end,

5426
03:47:53.060 --> 03:47:55.980
as it is an imposing figure in the chamber, who knows?

5427
03:47:55.980 --> 03:47:57.140
LIAM: Did you indicate to me, though,

5428
03:47:57.140 --> 03:47:59.060
that looking in that open book,

5429
03:47:59.060 --> 03:48:03.840
that I would know how to sort of make this thing?

5430
03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:06.580
MATT: Not the thing, the giant adamantine--

5431
03:48:06.580 --> 03:48:07.730
LIAM: The little bitty guy--

5432
03:48:07.730 --> 03:48:10.410
MATT: Yeah, with the right help and amount of time,

5433
03:48:10.410 --> 03:48:12.110
there's a chance it could succeed.

5434
03:48:13.520 --> 03:48:14.685
MARISHA: But you'd have to take the schematics?

5435
03:48:14.685 --> 03:48:16.030
LIAM: So tempting.
LAURA: It is, but.

5436
03:48:16.030 --> 03:48:17.457
LIAM: It's so tempting.

5437
03:48:17.457 --> 03:48:19.140
The materials are here.
LAURA: Yeah.

5438
03:48:19.140 --> 03:48:20.700
LIAM: The materials are here.

5439
03:48:20.700 --> 03:48:23.840
MARISHA: But, I mean our time.
TRAVIS: Three hours.

5440
03:48:23.840 --> 03:48:25.640
MARISHA: Three hours?
LIAM: We slept eight.

5441
03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:27.840
MARISHA: You think it takes three hours to build him?

5442
03:48:27.840 --> 03:48:29.220
TALIESIN: That's what it said in the book.

5443
03:48:29.220 --> 03:48:30.680
That's what he said when he was reading the--

5444
03:48:30.680 --> 03:48:32.700
LIAM: It's about, it's a guesstimate, but I think that--

5445
03:48:32.700 --> 03:48:34.240
MATT: It's partially finished is why.

5446
03:48:34.240 --> 03:48:35.830
To do it from scratch, it would take a lot longer,

5447
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:37.160
but there's a lot of elements

5448
03:48:37.160 --> 03:48:39.280
that are already mostly put together,

5449
03:48:39.280 --> 03:48:40.690
and it's just finalizing the process

5450
03:48:40.690 --> 03:48:42.280
that'll take about three or four hours.

5451
03:48:42.280 --> 03:48:43.880
LIAM: My gut is telling me to do it.

5452
03:48:44.823 --> 03:48:45.760
TRAVIS: All right, do it.

5453
03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:48.410
LAURA: I think we get next to the door.

5454
03:48:48.410 --> 03:48:49.400
LIAM: Yeah, figure out the door.

5455
03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:50.760
LAURA: Oh, this is so dumb--

5456
03:48:50.760 --> 03:48:52.140
SAM: You don't figure out the door, you just push it open.

5457
03:48:52.140 --> 03:48:53.780
LAURA: He lays out these temptations.

5458
03:48:53.780 --> 03:48:55.490
LIAM: There's no traps, you didn't find anything?

5459
03:48:55.490 --> 03:48:58.000
SAM: I'll check it for traps.
I'm checking the door for traps.

5460
03:48:58.000 --> 03:48:59.500
MATT: Make an investigation check.

5461
03:49:01.200 --> 03:49:03.770
SAM: A million, 30.

5462
03:49:03.770 --> 03:49:05.560
MATT: It is not trapped.

5463
03:49:05.560 --> 03:49:07.970
TRAVIS: Make yourself a little fucking companion, do it.

5464
03:49:07.970 --> 03:49:09.930
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens.

5465
03:49:09.930 --> 03:49:13.550
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to start walking us through this.

5466
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:16.344
MATT: Okay, this is a group skill challenge.

5467
03:49:16.344 --> 03:49:19.430
So you guys, working together with Caleb at the helm,

5468
03:49:19.430 --> 03:49:21.500
you get to decide what you want

5469
03:49:21.500 --> 03:49:24.070
to apply as aid to this, and then I'll tell you

5470
03:49:24.070 --> 03:49:25.410
what the corresponding skill would be.

5471
03:49:25.410 --> 03:49:28.180
You have to get four successes before two failures

5472
03:49:28.180 --> 03:49:29.640
for this to succeed.
MARISHA: Before two failures?

5473
03:49:29.640 --> 03:49:31.640
LIAM: Before two failures.

5474
03:49:31.640 --> 03:49:33.350
LAURA: Okay, what do we have to do?

5475
03:49:33.350 --> 03:49:35.120
MATT: There's the ingots, there's the tools,

5476
03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:36.850
there's the forge, there's the golem.

5477
03:49:36.850 --> 03:49:39.900
You can see part of a torso that's constructed.

5478
03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:42.990
You can see where the interior, similar to the one

5479
03:49:42.990 --> 03:49:46.233
that you fought, the mage hunter golem.

5480
03:49:46.233 --> 03:49:48.140
Just getting a good look at it, you can kind

5481
03:49:48.140 --> 03:49:51.020
of see have the skeletal structure works in the inside.

5482
03:49:51.020 --> 03:49:52.360
Looking at the central symbol, you know

5483
03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:53.970
that it has to be put over that,

5484
03:49:53.970 --> 03:49:56.220
and then brought there, and you do know

5485
03:49:56.220 --> 03:49:59.961
that whoever finishes

5486
03:49:59.961 --> 03:50:02.770
the creation process,

5487
03:50:02.770 --> 03:50:06.970
when the golem is given consciousness, it is bound

5488
03:50:06.970 --> 03:50:09.520
and imprints on whoever completes the final sigil.

5489
03:50:09.520 --> 03:50:11.758
SAM: Oh, like a little gosling.

5490
03:50:11.758 --> 03:50:14.310
LAURA: That's pretty cute.
TRAVIS: Ryan Gosling?

5491
03:50:14.310 --> 03:50:17.000
SAM: Yeah, that's how Ryan Gosling found his parents--

5492
03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:19.170
LAURA: Is there a skill where you have to paint the sigils,

5493
03:50:19.170 --> 03:50:23.880
or do any kind of decoration on him?

5494
03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:25.338
I can help with that.

5495
03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:27.113
LIAM: Well, I have no doubt

5496
03:50:27.113 --> 03:50:30.430
that you could not give this thing a wicked paint job.

5497
03:50:30.430 --> 03:50:33.910
Looking at the instructions, is there anything

5498
03:50:33.910 --> 03:50:37.090
about the outer decoration, in the way

5499
03:50:37.090 --> 03:50:39.240
that Jester is inquiring about?

5500
03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:40.820
MATT: No, but you can give it decorations.

5501
03:50:40.820 --> 03:50:41.653
LIAM: Of course--

5502
03:50:41.653 --> 03:50:43.227
MATT: It's just not important to its creation.

5503
03:50:43.227 --> 03:50:45.950
LAURA: Okay, I can help. Me and Fjord are pretty strong now.

5504
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:47.890
Fjord, you're pretty buff, yeah?

5505
03:50:47.890 --> 03:50:48.723
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5506
03:50:48.723 --> 03:50:50.720
LAURA: We could help with the ingots and stuff,

5507
03:50:50.720 --> 03:50:52.020
with the--
MATT: Okay, so the two

5508
03:50:52.020 --> 03:50:53.690
of you are carrying the larger heavy materials,

5509
03:50:53.690 --> 03:50:55.450
and bringing them over towards the golem.

5510
03:50:55.450 --> 03:50:57.510
Okay, you bring some of the adamantine ingots over,

5511
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:59.840
and some of the long struts of dark metal

5512
03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:00.720
that was against the back wall,

5513
03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:02.630
and as you begin to bring them closer,

5514
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:06.780
you watch as blue flames fill the previous vacuous eyes

5515
03:51:06.780 --> 03:51:10.192
of the forge golem. You see it get

5516
03:51:10.192 --> 03:51:13.918
into a defensive position, and just wait.

5517
03:51:13.918 --> 03:51:14.870
SAM: Give it an order.

5518
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:18.960
MATT: As you guys begin to feed
the ingots towards the anvil,

5519
03:51:18.960 --> 03:51:20.490
you can see it begin to put the tongs down

5520
03:51:20.490 --> 03:51:22.300
to hold it and hammer and shape,

5521
03:51:22.300 --> 03:51:23.970
and you guys go back with the instructions,

5522
03:51:23.970 --> 03:51:24.840
using your strength to try

5523
03:51:24.840 --> 03:51:26.860
and make this go by as quick as possible.

5524
03:51:26.860 --> 03:51:28.640
One of you, because you're aiding together,

5525
03:51:28.640 --> 03:51:30.940
make a strength check with advantage.

5526
03:51:30.940 --> 03:51:32.310
LAURA: No, you do it, you're stronger than me,

5527
03:51:32.310 --> 03:51:35.242
and I'm going to Guide you.
TRAVIS: I'm stronger than you?

5528
03:51:35.242 --> 03:51:38.042
LAURA: Aren't you at 18 now?
TRAVIS: No.

5529
03:51:38.042 --> 03:51:39.400
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were super strong.

5530
03:51:39.400 --> 03:51:40.233
TRAVIS: Nope.

5531
03:51:40.233 --> 03:51:41.400
MATT: He's stronger than he was, but you're still--

5532
03:51:41.400 --> 03:51:42.783
LAURA: Oh, I guess I would do it then.

5533
03:51:42.783 --> 03:51:44.750
But I'm going to Guide myself then.

5534
03:51:44.750 --> 03:51:45.967
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

5535
03:51:50.050 --> 03:51:52.590
MATT: So the blue flames of the forge now burning,

5536
03:51:52.590 --> 03:51:55.400
raging, the golem now hammering heavily

5537
03:51:55.400 --> 03:51:57.970
onto the anvil, you go ahead and try

5538
03:51:57.970 --> 03:52:01.784
to expedite the process through show of strength.

5539
03:52:01.784 --> 03:52:03.070
LAURA: That's okay, that's good.

5540
03:52:03.070 --> 03:52:06.730
Good thing it's advantage, and then I get a d4.

5541
03:52:06.730 --> 03:52:09.590
SAM: Okay, that's good.

5542
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:13.035
LAURA: 20.
MATT: 20, that's what you needed.

5543
03:52:14.130 --> 03:52:17.240
So as they're going through this,

5544
03:52:17.240 --> 03:52:19.530
you guys are-- this process is going well.

5545
03:52:19.530 --> 03:52:20.530
There aren't a lot of ingots,

5546
03:52:20.530 --> 03:52:23.550
but you're helping fold and turn and helping him fold,

5547
03:52:23.550 --> 03:52:24.640
and basically you begin to work

5548
03:52:24.640 --> 03:52:25.840
in rhythm with the golem, kind

5549
03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:27.930
of like you see the people creating the mochi in Japan,

5550
03:52:27.930 --> 03:52:29.690
where it's like hammer, turn, flip,

5551
03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:31.900
hammer, turn, yeah.

5552
03:52:31.900 --> 03:52:33.970
You guys begin to work with the golem,

5553
03:52:33.970 --> 03:52:35.200
and it's actually kind of impressive.

5554
03:52:35.200 --> 03:52:37.498
So that's one success. Who else wants to add

5555
03:52:37.498 --> 03:52:39.920
to this stuff?
SAM: What are the other steps?

5556
03:52:39.920 --> 03:52:41.910
MATT: Be creative. You can see elements of it

5557
03:52:41.910 --> 03:52:43.040
that are hanging from chains and need

5558
03:52:43.040 --> 03:52:45.490
to be put onto chains, you can see there are enchantments

5559
03:52:45.490 --> 03:52:47.080
in the book that need to be start woven

5560
03:52:47.080 --> 03:52:49.750
into it as parts of the metal start to come around.

5561
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:51.450
You can see that there--

5562
03:52:51.450 --> 03:52:53.080
any other creative elements here that you want

5563
03:52:53.080 --> 03:52:54.030
to bring to the--
MARISHA: Can I--

5564
03:52:54.030 --> 03:52:56.250
Oh, go ahead.
SAM: No, you go first.

5565
03:52:56.250 --> 03:53:01.250
MARISHA: Can I, tapping into the extract aspects that I did

5566
03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:05.180
on the other golem, and sort of getting a visualization

5567
03:53:05.180 --> 03:53:09.130
of its interior, can I use that knowledge,

5568
03:53:09.130 --> 03:53:10.960
along with reading the guides,

5569
03:53:10.960 --> 03:53:13.630
to start taking plates and the pieces,

5570
03:53:13.630 --> 03:53:14.930
and start connecting--
MATT: I would say yeah,

5571
03:53:14.930 --> 03:53:16.954
go ahead and make an arcana check.

5572
03:53:16.954 --> 03:53:21.954
MARISHA: Arcana check, okay, the arcana check.

5573
03:53:22.404 --> 03:53:23.750
TALIESIN: Which you now have a bonus for.

5574
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:24.680
MARISHA: I do.

5575
03:53:24.680 --> 03:53:29.330
I was hoping it would be-- can I get Guided while I think

5576
03:53:29.330 --> 03:53:31.958
about the arcane, thank you.

5577
03:53:32.880 --> 03:53:33.713
LIAM: Cocked.

5578
03:53:36.356 --> 03:53:40.170
MATT: It's those d4s, man.
LAURA: Yeah. (laughter)

5579
03:53:40.170 --> 03:53:42.835
Butts up against them.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5580
03:53:42.835 --> 03:53:45.390
MARISHA: 23.
MATT: 23?

5581
03:53:45.390 --> 03:53:48.860
Not just to your surprise, but impressive to you

5582
03:53:48.860 --> 03:53:52.410
in particular, Caleb, Beau begins finishing your sentences

5583
03:53:52.410 --> 03:53:54.550
as you begin describing from the book elements

5584
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:58.490
of how these magical inscriptions are used

5585
03:53:58.490 --> 03:54:00.420
to bind its body together, and to give it form

5586
03:54:00.420 --> 03:54:02.840
and purpose, and together, you both begin,

5587
03:54:02.840 --> 03:54:04.090
in tandem, reciting these things,

5588
03:54:04.090 --> 03:54:07.240
before she begins instinctively taking the chains

5589
03:54:07.240 --> 03:54:08.210
and pulling them together and seeing

5590
03:54:08.210 --> 03:54:09.620
where everything fits into place,

5591
03:54:09.620 --> 03:54:11.390
and marking with chalk on each part of its body

5592
03:54:11.390 --> 03:54:12.830
where certain sigils have to go.

5593
03:54:12.830 --> 03:54:14.370
And you're actually kind of having a hard time keeping up

5594
03:54:14.370 --> 03:54:15.360
with her at this moment.

5595
03:54:15.360 --> 03:54:17.890
MARISHA: Hand me PCH one.

5596
03:54:17.890 --> 03:54:19.345
No, the one next to it, thank you,

5597
03:54:19.345 --> 03:54:21.580
thank you.
LIAM: Flange, bevel.

5598
03:54:21.580 --> 03:54:25.110
MATT: That's two successes. All right, anybody else want

5599
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.943
to operate this one?

5600
03:54:25.943 --> 03:54:30.850
SAM: I'll take a look at, maybe, in the former golem,

5601
03:54:30.850 --> 03:54:34.320
did it have its most intricate mechanics

5602
03:54:34.320 --> 03:54:36.510
in the head or the hand, or just--

5603
03:54:36.510 --> 03:54:37.550
MATT: From what you could tell

5604
03:54:37.550 --> 03:54:40.560
for the brief time you had it up close to you,

5605
03:54:40.560 --> 03:54:43.690
before it melted down, I'd say probably within the chest

5606
03:54:43.690 --> 03:54:44.523
and head region.

5607
03:54:44.523 --> 03:54:45.980
SAM: Okay, well, I'm going to go into the chest

5608
03:54:45.980 --> 03:54:50.290
and help do any sort of tiny clockwork surgery sort

5609
03:54:50.290 --> 03:54:51.130
of stuff in there.

5610
03:54:51.130 --> 03:54:53.100
MATT: I like that. Make an intelligence check

5611
03:54:53.100 --> 03:54:54.720
for me.
SAM: Okay.

5612
03:54:54.720 --> 03:54:56.490
TALIESIN: You got her.

5613
03:54:56.490 --> 03:54:57.800
SAM: 16.
MATT: 16?

5614
03:54:57.800 --> 03:54:59.560
LAURA: Did you Guide yourself?
Because I gave you a Guidance.

5615
03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:00.860
SAM: You did?
LAURA: That's why I touched you.

5616
03:55:00.860 --> 03:55:02.210
MATT: Right before.
SAM: 17.

5617
03:55:02.210 --> 03:55:04.630
MATT: 17, okay, that's three successes.

5618
03:55:04.630 --> 03:55:05.930
With there, as she's putting it together,

5619
03:55:05.930 --> 03:55:06.763
you're getting inside--

5620
03:55:06.763 --> 03:55:07.970
SAM: Oh, that was the check.
MATT: That was the check.

5621
03:55:07.970 --> 03:55:09.760
SAM: Oh, I thought it was just to
see what I was going to do.

5622
03:55:09.760 --> 03:55:13.290
MATT: No, this was you trying to use that knowledge

5623
03:55:13.290 --> 03:55:14.990
in helping her along with her instructions, to go ahead

5624
03:55:14.990 --> 03:55:17.280
and start piecing together these little filaments

5625
03:55:17.280 --> 03:55:20.280
of wire, and these little conductors of arcane energy,

5626
03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:22.260
and helping put it to the power source in the center,

5627
03:55:22.260 --> 03:55:23.300
this kind of crystal that resides

5628
03:55:23.300 --> 03:55:24.600
in the middle of its chest.

5629
03:55:24.600 --> 03:55:26.400
That's three successes.
LIAM: I would like to make sure

5630
03:55:26.400 --> 03:55:28.560
that the glyphs and arcane symbols

5631
03:55:28.560 --> 03:55:31.080
on the actual device match what is on the instructions

5632
03:55:31.080 --> 03:55:32.740
and make sure that those are not unfinished,

5633
03:55:32.740 --> 03:55:35.380
and if they are, to etch them in further.

5634
03:55:35.380 --> 03:55:36.990
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: The writing on them.

5635
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:38.520
MATT: Okay, I'd say make a perception check for me.

5636
03:55:38.520 --> 03:55:40.060
LIAM: Perception check?

5637
03:55:40.060 --> 03:55:42.330
MATT: This is keeping consistency between the designs

5638
03:55:42.330 --> 03:55:44.810
on this. That would be--
LIAM: Knowing how arcana works?

5639
03:55:44.810 --> 03:55:46.380
MATT: We've already had an arcana check for this,

5640
03:55:46.380 --> 03:55:47.568
is what I'm saying.
LIAM: Okay.

5641
03:55:47.568 --> 03:55:49.280
SAM: I thought mine was going to be dex, so.

5642
03:55:49.280 --> 03:55:51.655
TALIESIN: I'll give you a d4.
MARISHA: I thought mine was going to be intellect.

5643
03:55:53.104 --> 03:55:56.210
SAM: You never know.
MATT: You never know, never know.

5644
03:55:56.210 --> 03:55:58.520
SAM: Oh, wait, hey, Caleb?
LIAM: Yeah?

5645
03:55:58.520 --> 03:56:02.320
SAM: Why don't you, I mean, not to backseat arcana

5646
03:56:02.320 --> 03:56:05.570
or whatever, but you could, you do have

5647
03:56:05.570 --> 03:56:07.950
that mote of possibility that might come in handy

5648
03:56:07.950 --> 03:56:09.140
in a moment like this.

5649
03:56:09.140 --> 03:56:10.985
LIAM: No, it's not prepared, that spell.

5650
03:56:10.985 --> 03:56:11.818
SAM: Oh.

5651
03:56:11.818 --> 03:56:15.190
LAURA: Plus doing magic in here might be bad.

5652
03:56:15.190 --> 03:56:16.770
SAM: We've been doing magic.
TALIESIN: We've been doing magic.

5653
03:56:16.770 --> 03:56:18.210
LIAM: Super low roll.
SAM: You just Guided me.

5654
03:56:18.210 --> 03:56:20.240
LIAM: Super low roll.
LAURA: We've been Guiding!

5655
03:56:20.240 --> 03:56:22.480
LIAM: Super low roll, seven.
LAURA: I forgot about that.

5656
03:56:22.480 --> 03:56:24.110
MATT: A seven?
LIAM: Yeah.

5657
03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:25.290
Rolled a three.

5658
03:56:25.290 --> 03:56:28.390
MATT: You begin to, as she's writing and inscribes over,

5659
03:56:28.390 --> 03:56:30.330
you go over and make a few adjustments

5660
03:56:30.330 --> 03:56:33.160
to fix hers, and as the sigils begin

5661
03:56:33.160 --> 03:56:35.620
to be burned in, about the third hour of the work,

5662
03:56:35.620 --> 03:56:38.550
the first enchantments spark and fail and sputter,

5663
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:40.060
first failure.

5664
03:56:40.060 --> 03:56:42.993
Three successes, one failure.
TALIESIN: Let me see what I can do.

5665
03:56:42.993 --> 03:56:45.560
MATT: It has to be a success, this next one.

5666
03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:48.880
TALIESIN: I'm going to go over and see if I can use my

5667
03:56:48.880 --> 03:56:51.760
crystal to sort of--
MARISHA: He started fixing my work.

5668
03:56:51.760 --> 03:56:53.750
TALIESIN: Shh.

5669
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:55.450
So much chatter.
LAURA: Don't fight.

5670
03:56:55.450 --> 03:56:57.610
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and see if I can instill some

5671
03:56:57.610 --> 03:57:01.900
of the spiritual life force from my crystal,

5672
03:57:01.900 --> 03:57:03.250
and use it to jumpstart this one,

5673
03:57:03.250 --> 03:57:06.170
and see if I can get everything up and running again,

5674
03:57:06.170 --> 03:57:08.040
see if I can use the crystal energies

5675
03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:11.665
to also fix whatever happened just there.

5676
03:57:13.070 --> 03:57:16.150
MATT: So you're attempting to bring spiritual energies

5677
03:57:16.150 --> 03:57:19.930
to an arcane construct--
TALIESIN: Too weird?

5678
03:57:21.090 --> 03:57:25.810
MATT: I will say that this has no impact on it whatsoever.

5679
03:57:25.810 --> 03:57:27.350
TALIESIN: Oh, well.
MATT: You attempt it,

5680
03:57:27.350 --> 03:57:29.860
but there is such a disconnect between the divine source

5681
03:57:29.860 --> 03:57:33.100
of your power and the attempt to empathize

5682
03:57:33.100 --> 03:57:36.510
with this power there, it doesn't take to it.

5683
03:57:36.510 --> 03:57:37.410
I won't consider it a failure,

5684
03:57:37.410 --> 03:57:39.040
but I'll let you know that there wasn't a chance

5685
03:57:39.040 --> 03:57:40.660
of success for that.
TALIESIN: All right.

5686
03:57:40.660 --> 03:57:41.493
MATT: But if there's something else you want

5687
03:57:41.493 --> 03:57:42.960
to try and bring to the table here.

5688
03:57:43.947 --> 03:57:45.060
TRAVIS: Make it some tea.

5689
03:57:45.060 --> 03:57:48.590
LIAM: Is there enough room in the chest of this thing

5690
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:51.900
for my cat to sit and jaeger?

5691
03:57:51.900 --> 03:57:53.680
MATT: You could design it that way if you want.

5692
03:57:53.680 --> 03:57:55.060
LIAM: I would like to.
MATT: Okay.

5693
03:57:55.060 --> 03:57:58.290
TRAVIS: If you fucking Pacific Rim a fucking--
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes.

5694
03:57:58.290 --> 03:57:59.140
MATT: I'll allow it.

5695
03:57:59.140 --> 03:58:01.290
LIAM: Can Frumpkin make the last--

5696
03:58:01.290 --> 03:58:03.760
SAM: Frumpkin has never made a challenge ever.

5697
03:58:03.760 --> 03:58:06.386
LAURA: Always fails.

5698
03:58:06.386 --> 03:58:07.540
MATT: This is a design thing. I mean,

5699
03:58:07.540 --> 03:58:12.540
if you wanted to help in fashioning a pocket for Frumpkin.

5700
03:58:12.763 --> 03:58:14.080
TALIESIN: I don't know if I'm the guy

5701
03:58:14.080 --> 03:58:15.190
to do that.
LAURA: I could help.

5702
03:58:15.190 --> 03:58:17.080
I'm artistic, that could have something

5703
03:58:17.080 --> 03:58:19.500
to do with artistry, right?
MATT: That's true, yeah.

5704
03:58:19.500 --> 03:58:22.380
MARISHA: Design, yeah.

5705
03:58:22.380 --> 03:58:24.110
LAURA: But if it's a performance check,

5706
03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:27.030
that's different than if it's like an artistry check.

5707
03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:29.110
SAM: I could try to put some--

5708
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:30.390
MARISHA: What's an artistry check?

5709
03:58:30.390 --> 03:58:32.110
SAM: What is the main function of this thing?

5710
03:58:32.110 --> 03:58:34.510
Does it say in the book, is it an attacking thing?

5711
03:58:34.510 --> 03:58:37.690
Is it just a general servant?
MATT: It's a servant.

5712
03:58:37.690 --> 03:58:41.540
SAM: Does it have any weaponry or attacks?

5713
03:58:41.540 --> 03:58:43.100
MATT: As you're developing it, I mean,

5714
03:58:43.100 --> 03:58:46.850
it has heavy fists, and there is something

5715
03:58:46.850 --> 03:58:48.240
about that crystal in its chest

5716
03:58:48.240 --> 03:58:51.320
in a chamber that seems to open and close here,

5717
03:58:51.320 --> 03:58:52.995
that's all you know.

5718
03:58:53.970 --> 03:58:55.770
LIAM: I mean.

5719
03:58:55.770 --> 03:58:58.120
SAM: I could put my pistol in it somehow,

5720
03:58:58.120 --> 03:59:02.150
and it could (imitates gunshot) and then come out.

5721
03:59:05.270 --> 03:59:06.103
TRAVIS: Do what you're going to do.

5722
03:59:06.103 --> 03:59:08.910
MATT: We're in the fourth hour now, so the final stage.

5723
03:59:08.910 --> 03:59:11.143
LIAM: Let's not do the cat because I have much more

5724
03:59:11.143 --> 03:59:14.910
flexibility with Frumpkin not in there.
SAM: How about a gun chest?

5725
03:59:16.765 --> 03:59:17.780
A little chest cannon?

5726
03:59:17.780 --> 03:59:19.730
MARISHA: Just a one shotgun chest.

5727
03:59:19.730 --> 03:59:20.650
SAM: Yeah, well we can do that.

5728
03:59:20.650 --> 03:59:24.190
LIAM: What was the test that you
already did as Nott, you used?

5729
03:59:24.190 --> 03:59:25.120
SAM: My test?
LIAM: Yeah.

5730
03:59:25.120 --> 03:59:27.880
SAM: Oh, well, mine was an intellect check.

5731
03:59:27.880 --> 03:59:31.420
I thought it was going to be dex, but it was not.

5732
03:59:31.420 --> 03:59:33.820
MATT: This was-- it was less about how good you were

5733
03:59:33.820 --> 03:59:36.200
at the wires, and more remembering and helping her along

5734
03:59:36.200 --> 03:59:38.437
with whether it was supposed to connect.

5735
03:59:41.703 --> 03:59:42.720
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do.

5736
03:59:42.720 --> 03:59:45.690
SAM: I mean, I have Mage Hand, I can sort of in there

5737
03:59:45.690 --> 03:59:46.880
and do stuff.

5738
03:59:46.880 --> 03:59:48.253
MATT: Well, you've already been doing stuff in there.

5739
03:59:48.253 --> 03:59:49.140
SAM: Yeah, sure.

5740
03:59:49.140 --> 03:59:51.800
LIAM: We can double up, though, one person can do two?

5741
03:59:51.800 --> 03:59:55.030
MATT: Once you've all tried something, you can.

5742
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:57.390
Otherwise, it's going to be a higher DC if you double up

5743
03:59:57.390 --> 03:59:59.421
because you've been doing multiple things.

5744
03:59:59.421 --> 04:00:02.455
TALIESIN: Is there a way to activate this--?

5745
04:00:02.455 --> 04:00:04.130
Is there a way to help activate this spell

5746
04:00:04.130 --> 04:00:05.500
to bond it to you?

5747
04:00:05.500 --> 04:00:08.510
LIAM: Is there any, in the manual,

5748
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:11.690
are there any instructions on enchanting the thing

5749
04:00:11.690 --> 04:00:13.450
to complete the job?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5750
04:00:13.450 --> 04:00:15.080
MATT: Yeah, no, that's part of what
you guys have been handling

5751
04:00:15.080 --> 04:00:16.760
with these sigils, and marking over,

5752
04:00:16.760 --> 04:00:19.449
over the central centerpiece there.

5753
04:00:19.449 --> 04:00:22.560
SAM: I could use my shocking grasp to sort of jumpstart it

5754
04:00:22.560 --> 04:00:24.085
with a little bolt of electricity.

5755
04:00:24.085 --> 04:00:25.510
TALIESIN: I have no idea if that would work,

5756
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:27.189
and that hurt the last one.

5757
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:28.538
MARISHA: Frankenstein's monster.

5758
04:00:28.538 --> 04:00:31.180
LAURA: Oh, but fire is good.

5759
04:00:31.180 --> 04:00:32.013
SAM: Yeah--

5760
04:00:32.013 --> 04:00:35.623
MARISHA: Arcane fireball. He'd be a little burning furnace?

5761
04:00:35.623 --> 04:00:36.456
LAURA: (gasps)

5762
04:00:36.456 --> 04:00:38.120
TALIESIN: I can try and put a Sacred Flame into it,

5763
04:00:38.120 --> 04:00:39.970
into the crystal.
LAURA: Yeah, Sacred Flame it.

5764
04:00:39.970 --> 04:00:41.080
MATT: You want try to that?

5765
04:00:41.080 --> 04:00:42.260
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame into the crystal?

5766
04:00:42.260 --> 04:00:43.640
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.
TALIESIN: All right.

5767
04:00:43.640 --> 04:00:46.370
MATT: I'll say since this is
less than an empathic connection

5768
04:00:46.370 --> 04:00:47.950
to something that has no empathy,

5769
04:00:47.950 --> 04:00:50.670
this is instead most of a divine spark,

5770
04:00:50.670 --> 04:00:52.650
in an attempt to utilize and channel the Wild Mother

5771
04:00:52.650 --> 04:00:54.820
to give a semblance of life to something

5772
04:00:54.820 --> 04:00:56.812
that was not intended to live.

5773
04:00:56.812 --> 04:00:58.510
I'll let you do a religion check for that.

5774
04:00:58.510 --> 04:01:01.450
TALIESIN: Ew, okay.
LAURA: Oh, God.

5775
04:01:01.450 --> 04:01:05.110
LAURA: Guidance!
TALIESIN: I've got Guidance.

5776
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:07.280
MATT: It's not a terribly high DC, but.

5777
04:01:07.280 --> 04:01:09.252
MARISHA: Come on--
TALIESIN: Hey!

5778
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:13.780
26.
(cheering)

5779
04:01:15.091 --> 04:01:16.590
MATT: It was a 16 DC, so that's a success.

5780
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:18.664
TALIESIN: I have a three in religion, so that's okay.

5781
04:01:18.664 --> 04:01:20.720
MATT: (laughs)

5782
04:01:20.720 --> 04:01:24.420
All righty, so after it's fully assembled

5783
04:01:24.420 --> 04:01:25.660
at the end of the fourth hour,

5784
04:01:25.660 --> 04:01:27.500
putting the final pieces together,

5785
04:01:27.500 --> 04:01:31.030
there's the final trigger, and you,

5786
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:33.920
Caduceus, release this burning, divine flame

5787
04:01:33.920 --> 04:01:35.850
on the inside, as it burns through the inside

5788
04:01:35.850 --> 04:01:39.680
of this tiny, squat, little round, rotund golem,

5789
04:01:39.680 --> 04:01:42.910
you watch as the inside of its seams begin

5790
04:01:42.910 --> 04:01:44.530
to glow with that same divine light,

5791
04:01:44.530 --> 04:01:47.110
and the sigils begin to fire up.

5792
04:01:47.110 --> 04:01:48.150
The last one is not completed.

5793
04:01:48.150 --> 04:01:49.780
Who's going to complete the final sigil?

5794
04:01:49.780 --> 04:01:51.120
LAURA: Oh, who wants it? Caleb, did you want it?

5795
04:01:51.120 --> 04:01:52.580
MATT: Who's it going to imprint upon?

5796
04:01:53.740 --> 04:01:56.540
SAM: He's already got Frumpkin, I mean,

5797
04:01:56.540 --> 04:01:58.530
Caleb, whatever you want, I love you.

5798
04:01:58.530 --> 04:02:01.680
MARISHA: I got a sweet braid wrap, so.

5799
04:02:01.680 --> 04:02:04.460
LAURA: Caleb, you're really excited about this,

5800
04:02:04.460 --> 04:02:06.290
you should do it.

5801
04:02:06.290 --> 04:02:08.433
LIAM: All right, yeah.

5802
04:02:08.433 --> 04:02:10.290
MATT: Okay, you complete the final sigil.

5803
04:02:10.290 --> 04:02:15.290
With that, the glyph glows, you see across its face,

5804
04:02:15.760 --> 04:02:18.100
where the two pale spots, the divots

5805
04:02:18.100 --> 04:02:21.600
where the eyes would be spark on.

5806
04:02:21.600 --> 04:02:23.722
The chains detach, and it

5807
04:02:24.920 --> 04:02:27.565
lands on the ground.
TALIESIN: And kills you.

5808
04:02:28.430 --> 04:02:32.213
MATT: And just looks towards you.

5809
04:02:32.213 --> 04:02:34.410
MARISHA: (yells)
LAURA: We've got a golem!

5810
04:02:34.410 --> 04:02:37.160
MARISHA: Oh my god.
(laughter)

5811
04:02:37.160 --> 04:02:39.780
LAURA: Four days passed in the real world while we--

5812
04:02:39.780 --> 04:02:42.060
MATT: Yes, I'm keeping track of all that.

5813
04:02:42.060 --> 04:02:44.420
This is yours now. You get to name it.

5814
04:02:44.420 --> 04:02:46.160
MARISHA: What are you going to name him?

5815
04:02:46.160 --> 04:02:47.121
LAURA: Peanut, name it Peanut.

5816
04:02:47.121 --> 04:02:49.671
SAM: Doty, Doty.

5817
04:02:49.671 --> 04:02:50.712
MARISHA: Proto-Doty!

5818
04:02:50.712 --> 04:02:52.760
LIAM: This is Villi.
LAURA: Villi?

5819
04:02:52.760 --> 04:02:55.590
LIAM: W-I-L-L-I, Villi.
SAM: No, it's Willi.

5820
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:57.350
LIAM: Villi.
MARISHA: Willi.

5821
04:02:57.350 --> 04:02:59.425
LIAM: Willi, that's what I said, Willi.

5822
04:02:59.425 --> 04:03:01.990
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think you're saying Villi, like a V.

5823
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:03.580
LIAM: No, I'm saying Willi.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

5824
04:03:03.580 --> 04:03:04.859
but it's like this letter,
LAURA: Willi?

5825
04:03:04.859 --> 04:03:06.690
TRAVIS: Instead of this letter.
LAURA: Why Willi?

5826
04:03:06.690 --> 04:03:08.290
LIAM: You guys have known me for a long time.

5827
04:03:08.290 --> 04:03:10.650
Are we really still pecking at my accent? It's Willi.

5828
04:03:10.650 --> 04:03:12.640
TRAVIS: Just want you to get that letter right.

5829
04:03:12.640 --> 04:03:17.410
LAURA: A lot of people call their weens a willy.

5830
04:03:17.410 --> 04:03:18.410
LIAM: This is Willi.

5831
04:03:18.410 --> 04:03:20.430
LAURA: Okay, so his name is ween.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5832
04:03:20.430 --> 04:03:21.950
LIAM: You love dicks.

5833
04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:23.883
LAURA: I mean, I do.

5834
04:03:23.883 --> 04:03:24.974
LIAM: So Willi.

5835
04:03:24.974 --> 04:03:26.080
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Little Willi.

5836
04:03:26.080 --> 04:03:27.800
LIAM: Little Willi.
MARISHA: It's little Willi.

5837
04:03:27.800 --> 04:03:30.550
LIAM: Even better, Little Willi.

5838
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:31.460
MARISHA: Can we call him William?

5839
04:03:31.460 --> 04:03:33.270
MATT: It stands about four and a half feet tall,

5840
04:03:33.270 --> 04:03:35.770
and it's just this ball of rock and metal.

5841
04:03:36.640 --> 04:03:38.870
It has glowing eyes, and the different runes on it,

5842
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:41.880
slightly giving off a gentle arcane glow,

5843
04:03:41.880 --> 04:03:43.800
and it just looks at you.

5844
04:03:43.800 --> 04:03:46.140
LIAM: You are William.

5845
04:03:46.140 --> 04:03:49.842
Or also Little Willi, yeah?

5846
04:03:50.960 --> 04:03:52.565
Sit.

5847
04:03:52.565 --> 04:03:54.857
(crunching noises)

5848
04:03:56.805 --> 04:03:58.290
LAURA: Dance, tell him to--
LIAM: Speak.

5849
04:03:59.250 --> 04:04:03.290
Do you speak?
LAURA: He ain't got no mouth.

5850
04:04:03.290 --> 04:04:05.020
MATT: There's no mouth, there's no features there.

5851
04:04:05.020 --> 04:04:07.020
TRAVIS: Tell it to punch Beau.

5852
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:10.015
LIAM: Punch Beau.

5853
04:04:12.200 --> 04:04:13.703
MATT: A fist comes swinging at you--

5854
04:04:13.703 --> 04:04:15.220
MARISHA: I flex my abs and try and take it

5855
04:04:15.220 --> 04:04:16.840
to see how it does.

5856
04:04:16.840 --> 04:04:18.380
MATT: Roll an attack with advantage,

5857
04:04:18.380 --> 04:04:19.830
because she's letting it happen.

5858
04:04:22.171 --> 04:04:23.400
TALIESIN: This is how you break your abs.

5859
04:04:23.400 --> 04:04:28.398
LIAM: With an advantage, and its attack is 16.

5860
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:32.750
MARISHA: You can't get through my abs, little Willi.

5861
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:36.150
MATT: She just kind of flexes and stops it.

5862
04:04:36.150 --> 04:04:38.060
LIAM: Halt, William.

5863
04:04:38.060 --> 04:04:40.240
MARISHA: Little Willi's weak.

5864
04:04:40.240 --> 04:04:43.340
TRAVIS: Tell Willi to jump
LAURA: Tell Willi--

5865
04:04:43.340 --> 04:04:44.923
LIAM: Dance, Willi.

5866
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:50.950
LAURA: I dance with him.

5867
04:04:52.120 --> 04:04:56.360
MATT: It understands dancing as much as the limitations

5868
04:04:56.360 --> 04:04:57.430
of the enchantment allow.

5869
04:04:57.430 --> 04:05:00.560
LIAM: Hey, run in a circle in this room, William.

5870
04:05:00.560 --> 04:05:02.300
MATT: The tables start being knocked over,

5871
04:05:02.300 --> 04:05:04.620
tools just scattered onto the ground,

5872
04:05:04.620 --> 04:05:05.453
making a huge mess.

5873
04:05:05.453 --> 04:05:06.286
LAURA: Let's get out of this room.

5874
04:05:06.286 --> 04:05:08.687
We need to keep moving. It's passing time, come on.

5875
04:05:08.687 --> 04:05:10.700
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.
LIAM: All right.

5876
04:05:10.700 --> 04:05:13.090
SAM: Just look around for a boot jet pack.

5877
04:05:13.090 --> 04:05:15.370
MARISHA: Will William carry me?
MATT: Make a perception check.

5878
04:05:16.880 --> 04:05:19.890
SAM: Seven.
MATT: No dice, sorry.

5879
04:05:19.890 --> 04:05:22.170
LAURA: Hey, since we could take this stuff,

5880
04:05:22.170 --> 04:05:24.020
maybe it's okay if we take an ingot.

5881
04:05:24.020 --> 04:05:25.870
MARISHA: Yeah, let's take some ingots, right?

5882
04:05:25.870 --> 04:05:27.440
TRAVIS: I don't know, the last time we grabbed it,

5883
04:05:27.440 --> 04:05:31.120
remember, the golem, eyes glowing blue,

5884
04:05:31.120 --> 04:05:33.410
came over, ready, I feel like if you don't bring it

5885
04:05:33.410 --> 04:05:35.100
to the table, you get fucked up.

5886
04:05:35.100 --> 04:05:36.940
TRAVIS: Oh, that is true, that could be possible.

5887
04:05:36.940 --> 04:05:38.080
Okay, let's go out.

5888
04:05:38.080 --> 04:05:39.290
TALIESIN: Let's be happy with where we are.

5889
04:05:39.290 --> 04:05:40.731
LIAM: This one here,

5890
04:05:40.731 --> 04:05:43.136
William, will you carry Beauregard here?

5891
04:05:43.136 --> 04:05:46.160
MATT: (crashing sounds)

5892
04:05:46.160 --> 04:05:48.500
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Oh!

5893
04:05:48.500 --> 04:05:50.050
Yes!

5894
04:05:50.900 --> 04:05:52.843
LAURA: We're going out the door, yeah?

5895
04:05:52.843 --> 04:05:55.410
MATT: All right, you step through, you push open the door.

5896
04:05:55.410 --> 04:05:57.540
There's no handle, it just opens up,

5897
04:05:57.540 --> 04:06:02.370
and there's like a cylindrical crimson hallway.

5898
04:06:03.880 --> 04:06:05.910
As you step into it, there's no real sense

5899
04:06:05.910 --> 04:06:07.400
of up or down, and you start walking,

5900
04:06:07.400 --> 04:06:08.770
and it feels like it's turning,

5901
04:06:08.770 --> 04:06:10.780
but you're not sure if it is or not.

5902
04:06:10.780 --> 04:06:13.780
It goes on for about 40 or 50 feet,

5903
04:06:13.780 --> 04:06:16.100
before you see a faint green glow

5904
04:06:16.100 --> 04:06:18.045
from the chamber beyond, as you pass

5905
04:06:18.045 --> 04:06:21.180
into and beyond the threshold.

5906
04:06:23.970 --> 04:06:28.842
As you step into this next room, I've got to find it.

5907
04:06:28.842 --> 04:06:31.624
TALIESIN: So many pages.
MATT: I know, it's a big place.

5908
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:35.640
The first thing that catches your senses is the smell,

5909
04:06:36.780 --> 04:06:40.530
old, wet rot, chemicals,

5910
04:06:41.410 --> 04:06:43.400
pungent and assaulting your nostrils.

5911
04:06:44.340 --> 04:06:47.180
The faint flickering green light frames the chamber's

5912
04:06:47.180 --> 04:06:50.740
long shadows from a series of green glowing orbs

5913
04:06:50.740 --> 04:06:54.170
that are affixed to portions of the wall,

5914
04:06:54.170 --> 04:06:57.850
and grates that spill this faint green light

5915
04:06:57.850 --> 04:07:00.000
across the slick stone floor.

5916
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:03.745
A thick mist hangs in the air

5917
04:07:03.745 --> 04:07:06.869
down around your ankles and knees,

5918
04:07:06.869 --> 04:07:11.090
while numerous glass pillars appear set

5919
04:07:11.090 --> 04:07:14.890
along the center of the chamber at different elevations.

5920
04:07:14.890 --> 04:07:17.150
Perhaps 10 or so in total,

5921
04:07:17.150 --> 04:07:19.775
from what you can just glean at this view,

5922
04:07:20.720 --> 04:07:23.935
the closest one appearing damaged and cracked.

5923
04:07:24.880 --> 04:07:27.870
You take a step in, and your feet splashes,

5924
04:07:27.870 --> 04:07:30.330
as there's apparently a small thin layer

5925
04:07:30.330 --> 04:07:32.011
of liquid within the room.

5926
04:07:32.011 --> 04:07:35.077
MARISHA: Oh, they're like incubators or some shit.

5927
04:07:36.556 --> 04:07:39.740
MATT: You hear a very faint rhythmic beating sound,

5928
04:07:39.740 --> 04:07:41.813
and you can feel a thrum to the floor.

5929
04:07:41.813 --> 04:07:45.030
(heartbeat)

5930
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:48.220
TRAVIS: Oh, gross.
LAURA: Nope, nope, nope, nope.

5931
04:07:49.080 --> 04:07:51.040
MATT: You take a moment to focus, and you can see

5932
04:07:51.040 --> 04:07:54.950
within the glass tubes, standing probably

5933
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:57.450
about nine or so feet in height each,

5934
04:07:57.450 --> 04:07:59.080
they are frosted from the inside

5935
04:07:59.080 --> 04:08:01.240
by some sort of murky liquid, it seems,

5936
04:08:01.240 --> 04:08:02.300
and you can just faintly make out

5937
04:08:02.300 --> 04:08:04.650
shadows or shapes from within.

5938
04:08:08.220 --> 04:08:10.850
You can see chains dangling from the ceiling,

5939
04:08:10.850 --> 04:08:12.310
ones that are probably used to carry

5940
04:08:12.310 --> 04:08:17.298
or shift these large, strange liquid-filled jars.

5941
04:08:18.330 --> 04:08:20.000
LAURA: And there's a broken one.

5942
04:08:20.000 --> 04:08:21.410
MATT: The one nearest to you is cracked,

5943
04:08:21.410 --> 04:08:23.885
with a slight piece missing.

5944
04:08:23.885 --> 04:08:25.751
SAM: Is there a form in it?

5945
04:08:25.751 --> 04:08:26.730
MATT: You're a bit far away,

5946
04:08:26.730 --> 04:08:29.510
you can get a closer look, if you like.

5947
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:33.010
TALIESIN: You're also, to be fair,
not sinking into the water.

5948
04:08:34.880 --> 04:08:37.310
SAM: Should I go over and look? I'll go over

5949
04:08:37.310 --> 04:08:39.239
and look at that one.
LAURA: Be really stealthy.

5950
04:08:39.239 --> 04:08:41.789
SAM: Yeah, I'll stealth over.
MATT: Make a stealth check.

5951
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:46.020
SAM: 32.
MATT: Okay.

5952
04:08:46.020 --> 04:08:48.899
You move over, the green lights flickering a bit,

5953
04:08:48.899 --> 04:08:52.760
just by the nature of the space inside.

5954
04:08:52.760 --> 04:08:55.330
Make your way over towards the first.

5955
04:08:55.330 --> 04:08:57.790
There's two tubes right there on the immediate right

5956
04:08:57.790 --> 04:08:59.030
and left of a staircase that leads up

5957
04:08:59.030 --> 04:09:00.060
to the central platform. There's

5958
04:09:00.060 --> 04:09:02.490
about a five-foot raised section in the middle

5959
04:09:02.490 --> 04:09:07.300
five of these, or four of these are situated.

5960
04:09:07.300 --> 04:09:09.240
You go to the first, the one that you see the crack on,

5961
04:09:09.240 --> 04:09:11.210
and you can just glance on the inside

5962
04:09:11.210 --> 04:09:13.200
by getting up on the stair and looking within.

5963
04:09:13.200 --> 04:09:15.650
The smell of rot is strong the closer you get,

5964
04:09:15.650 --> 04:09:16.980
and on the inside, you can see

5965
04:09:16.980 --> 04:09:19.255
what looks to be a corpse.

5966
04:09:22.199 --> 04:09:25.250
What bit of liquid there is visible in the nearby tubes,

5967
04:09:25.250 --> 04:09:30.250
you can see, it's semi-cloudy with a gray-green liquid,

5968
04:09:30.280 --> 04:09:32.006
faint bits of floating material, some sort of matter

5969
04:09:32.006 --> 04:09:37.006
that just is gathered and fungal almost,

5970
04:09:37.300 --> 04:09:41.100
with humanoid-type bodies, motionless and suspended in it.

5971
04:09:41.100 --> 04:09:43.750
The cracked one, you can see the liquid is

5972
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:46.030
about halfway, and the exposed part

5973
04:09:46.030 --> 04:09:49.880
of it is just this rotted corpse with its mouth open,

5974
04:09:49.880 --> 04:09:52.860
the lips pulled back, fungus growing

5975
04:09:52.860 --> 04:09:55.080
across parts of its face.

5976
04:09:55.080 --> 04:09:58.100
It appears to be male, or was male at some point,

5977
04:09:58.100 --> 04:10:00.690
thin black hair that's fallen out of it,

5978
04:10:00.690 --> 04:10:02.725
and part of its face.

5979
04:10:02.725 --> 04:10:06.152
SAM: Like a human, or bigger--
MATT: Yeah, human.

5980
04:10:07.917 --> 04:10:10.680
SAM: I sort of shout-whisper this to the buddies.

5981
04:10:13.620 --> 04:10:15.080
TRAVIS: The water that we're standing in,

5982
04:10:15.080 --> 04:10:19.040
is it rippling with that (heartbeat)?

5983
04:10:19.040 --> 04:10:22.900
MATT: Very faintly, you can feel it through the floor.

5984
04:10:26.830 --> 04:10:28.580
SAM: Should we go look at another one?

5985
04:10:28.580 --> 04:10:31.530
MARISHA: Can I look and see which, based off

5986
04:10:31.530 --> 04:10:34.370
of what I see Fjord looking at,

5987
04:10:34.370 --> 04:10:38.210
and those ripples, do the ripples in the liquid seem

5988
04:10:38.210 --> 04:10:41.280
to be coming from one direction to the other?

5989
04:10:41.280 --> 04:10:44.650
MATT: Make a perception check.
TALIESIN: I will do the same,

5990
04:10:44.650 --> 04:10:45.947
if that's okay.
MATT: Sure.

5991
04:10:45.947 --> 04:10:47.155
MARISHA: Why is it always perception?

5992
04:10:47.155 --> 04:10:48.640
TALIESIN: I'm having a feeling.

5993
04:10:48.640 --> 04:10:51.100
MATT: Perception is just looking and seeing patterns,

5994
04:10:51.100 --> 04:10:52.480
investigation is taking the time to--

5995
04:10:52.480 --> 04:10:54.380
TALIESIN: 14.
MATT: 14?

5996
04:10:54.380 --> 04:10:55.213
MARISHA: 20.

5997
04:10:55.213 --> 04:10:58.370
MATT: 20, okay, you're still taken aback

5998
04:10:58.370 --> 04:11:00.290
by the interior, something's very off-putting

5999
04:11:00.290 --> 04:11:01.990
because there are elements of the rot that is natural

6000
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:04.370
and familiar to you, but the chemical smell

6001
04:11:04.370 --> 04:11:06.490
and something else here is very unfamiliar

6002
04:11:06.490 --> 04:11:08.390
and alien that you're not a fan of.

6003
04:11:08.390 --> 04:11:10.580
You notice, with each thrum, the ripples seem

6004
04:11:10.580 --> 04:11:13.700
to come from the walls to the middle and back out.

6005
04:11:13.700 --> 04:11:17.170
So the particular source appears to be everywhere.

6006
04:11:17.170 --> 04:11:19.084
MARISHA: Everywhere.
MATT: Yeah.

6007
04:11:19.084 --> 04:11:23.090
LIAM: It is the same pace as a heartbeat, yeah?

6008
04:11:23.090 --> 04:11:26.190
MATT: It has a similar rhythmic thrum to it, yeah.

6009
04:11:26.190 --> 04:11:27.840
LIAM: Proximity, proximity.

6010
04:11:27.840 --> 04:11:29.280
LAURA: I don't like this place, you guys.

6011
04:11:29.280 --> 04:11:30.880
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, one of the rooms

6012
04:11:30.880 --> 04:11:33.921
that links to this is the Heart Study outside

6013
04:11:33.921 --> 04:11:35.300
of the Permaheart.

6014
04:11:37.360 --> 04:11:39.640
SAM: Well, that seems likely.

6015
04:11:43.316 --> 04:11:45.680
TRAVIS: Can we see the portal or the door

6016
04:11:45.680 --> 04:11:48.340
that we came in from just now, behind us?

6017
04:11:48.340 --> 04:11:51.470
MATT: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Is it a push door, as well?

6018
04:11:52.660 --> 04:11:55.280
MATT: When you guys came through, it was already

6019
04:11:55.280 --> 04:11:57.960
halfway ajar, and you push it slightly open

6020
04:11:57.960 --> 04:11:58.830
to get into the rest of the chamber.

6021
04:11:58.830 --> 04:12:00.610
So it's open currently.

6022
04:12:00.610 --> 04:12:04.670
TRAVIS: Can I move to a left along the wall

6023
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:07.120
that we're at, and just keep an eye out

6024
04:12:07.120 --> 04:12:10.740
for a door, moving into the room further?

6025
04:12:10.740 --> 04:12:12.270
But along the wall.
MATT: Along the wall?

6026
04:12:12.270 --> 04:12:14.230
TRAVIS: Not in between the two, or the columns.

6027
04:12:14.230 --> 04:12:17.020
MATT: Okay, so as you move along, it's the left hand side?

6028
04:12:17.020 --> 04:12:18.770
Okay, as you move along the left hand side,

6029
04:12:18.770 --> 04:12:21.450
you can now see, there's about,

6030
04:12:21.450 --> 04:12:23.210
you can see what makes probably

6031
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:24.750
about eight or so of these tubes.

6032
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:27.425
Like some of the nearest ones, you can see the shapes.

6033
04:12:28.760 --> 04:12:30.270
They're humanoid, but something's off,

6034
04:12:30.270 --> 04:12:32.150
one of them you see pressed against it,

6035
04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:35.100
and they all share the same male human,

6036
04:12:35.100 --> 04:12:38.850
long, dark hair, a pointed bit

6037
04:12:38.850 --> 04:12:40.992
of facial hair off the chin,

6038
04:12:42.039 --> 04:12:45.490
but one of them has this bulbous cancerous tumor

6039
04:12:45.490 --> 04:12:48.220
on one shoulder where you can see hundreds

6040
04:12:48.220 --> 04:12:51.347
of teeth protruding from--

6041
04:12:51.347 --> 04:12:52.697
MARISHA: Obann?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6042
04:12:52.697 --> 04:12:53.797
MARISHA: That's not Obann, right?

6043
04:12:53.797 --> 04:12:56.510
MATT: Another one, as you walk by, you can see a portion

6044
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:59.990
of its chest is swollen with stitches,

6045
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:02.990
and where it cracks open, you can see a large mouth

6046
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:04.560
where a tongue hangs out.

6047
04:13:04.560 --> 04:13:06.300
LIAM: Ew, dermoids, dermoids.

6048
04:13:06.300 --> 04:13:09.490
TRAVIS: He's trying to merge himself with something else.

6049
04:13:09.490 --> 04:13:14.470
LAURA: Does it resemble what Halas looked like, what his?

6050
04:13:14.470 --> 04:13:16.610
MATT: It looks pretty similar to Halas' features,

6051
04:13:16.610 --> 04:13:17.650
from the portraits you've seen.

6052
04:13:17.650 --> 04:13:19.380
LIAM: It's hard to say.

6053
04:13:19.380 --> 04:13:22.420
MATT: You also can see, on the opposite end of this chamber,

6054
04:13:23.840 --> 04:13:26.320
about three or so from this vantage point

6055
04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:29.700
of the tubes, are broken,

6056
04:13:31.340 --> 04:13:34.730
shattered and jagged, maybe about standing half

6057
04:13:34.730 --> 04:13:35.780
or less tall.

6058
04:13:35.780 --> 04:13:36.970
MARISHA: How many?

6059
04:13:36.970 --> 04:13:39.690
MATT: Three from your current vantage point.

6060
04:13:39.690 --> 04:13:43.865
LAURA: And the heart of the Laughing Hand
is what is powering all of this?

6061
04:13:43.865 --> 04:13:45.800
TRAVIS: Well, I think it's just out of here.

6062
04:13:45.800 --> 04:13:49.650
I will summon the sword, and I'm going to use the word

6063
04:13:49.650 --> 04:13:52.236
to make it glow blue.

6064
04:13:52.236 --> 04:13:54.620
MATT: The blue glow lights up around you,

6065
04:13:54.620 --> 04:13:57.340
and you hold it high. You can see now the blue light

6066
04:13:57.340 --> 04:13:59.650
from the sword shining against the whole wet interior.

6067
04:13:59.650 --> 04:14:01.690
It's super humid and warm in this chamber,

6068
04:14:01.690 --> 04:14:03.284
uncomfortably so, you can feel the moisture

6069
04:14:03.284 --> 04:14:05.500
and the sweat beginning to build up on your brow

6070
04:14:05.500 --> 04:14:07.490
and face and under your armor.

6071
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:12.020
You can see now the shards of the broken tubes all

6072
04:14:12.020 --> 04:14:13.170
across the distant floor,

6073
04:14:13.170 --> 04:14:15.180
and bits and pieces along near you,

6074
04:14:15.180 --> 04:14:17.387
as well as the glistening chains hanging from the ceiling.

6075
04:14:17.387 --> 04:14:20.630
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave.
MATT: Eyes of the Grave, okay.

6076
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:22.050
Nothing catches your attention.

6077
04:14:22.050 --> 04:14:22.883
TALIESIN: Okay.

6078
04:14:22.883 --> 04:14:24.290
LIAM: As soon as I see him light up,

6079
04:14:24.290 --> 04:14:26.639
Caleb's hands start to burn, as well.

6080
04:14:26.639 --> 04:14:29.520
TALIESIN: Not even the things in the tubes, nothing?

6081
04:14:29.520 --> 04:14:31.780
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

6082
04:14:31.780 --> 04:14:34.088
MATT: But you do hear,

6083
04:14:34.088 --> 04:14:36.104
(heavy landing)

6084
04:14:38.920 --> 04:14:41.530
about 10 feet to your left, Fjord,

6085
04:14:41.530 --> 04:14:43.910
as a shape drops from the ceiling,

6086
04:14:44.899 --> 04:14:45.732
(landing)

6087
04:14:45.732 --> 04:14:47.670
the water sprays, and you turn and look,

6088
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:51.590
and you see a hulking shape, maybe about nine feet

6089
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:56.590
to the shoulder. A flesh mass of pustules

6090
04:14:56.770 --> 04:14:59.660
and boils, a singular head rises up

6091
04:14:59.660 --> 04:15:03.280
with tattered black hair, a large descended jaw,

6092
04:15:03.280 --> 04:15:04.980
and tattered bits of the facial hair,

6093
04:15:04.980 --> 04:15:08.920
reminiscent of Halas, eyes yellow and burning,

6094
04:15:08.920 --> 04:15:12.262
with three other heads, misshapen and formed

6095
04:15:12.262 --> 04:15:15.060
across elements of its shoulder.

6096
04:15:15.060 --> 04:15:17.070
These two bulbous,

6097
04:15:17.070 --> 04:15:20.040
mutated-looking, gorilla-like hairless arms kind

6098
04:15:20.040 --> 04:15:23.460
of clustered onto the ground, as two smaller long,

6099
04:15:23.460 --> 04:15:27.450
thin, withered arms curl up in front.

6100
04:15:27.450 --> 04:15:30.620
Two other large, mountainous arms reach up behind,

6101
04:15:30.620 --> 04:15:33.040
as a pair of six visible arms over its thick,

6102
04:15:33.040 --> 04:15:34.823
trunk-like feet.

6103
04:15:34.823 --> 04:15:36.687
MARISHA: That's cool!

6104
04:15:36.687 --> 04:15:39.277
MATT: (roars)

6105
04:15:39.277 --> 04:15:40.527
And that's where we pick up next week.

6106
04:15:40.527 --> 04:15:43.356
(cheering)

6107
04:15:43.356 --> 04:15:45.690
TRAVIS: Breaking the laws of nature!

6108
04:15:45.690 --> 04:15:48.040
SAM: This is gross.
LAURA: What the fu--

6109
04:15:48.040 --> 04:15:50.030
MATT: You get to mess with this fucker next week.

6110
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:52.690
TRAVIS: (yelling) Oh, what the fuck is that?!

6111
04:15:52.690 --> 04:15:53.980
SAM: Is that something you made?

6112
04:15:53.980 --> 04:15:55.058
MATT: I customized a lot of that--

6113
04:15:55.058 --> 04:15:56.940
LAURA: Oh m'lord.
TALIESIN: Dude.

6114
04:15:58.270 --> 04:16:00.080
Dude.
SAM: Ew!

6115
04:16:00.080 --> 04:16:01.560
TALIESIN: Dude.
LAURA: Oh, he is not--

6116
04:16:01.560 --> 04:16:03.910
LIAM: Pass it around when you're done.
LAURA: -- attractive.

6117
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:05.350
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, sir.

6118
04:16:05.350 --> 04:16:06.183
LAURA: What has Halas been doing?

6119
04:16:06.183 --> 04:16:11.148
He needs to rethink his experiments.
MATT: Anyway, we'll pick up from there

6120
04:16:11.148 --> 04:16:12.481
next week.

6121
04:16:14.410 --> 04:16:16.560
Shit's getting weird. Thank you guys so much

6122
04:16:16.560 --> 04:16:18.470
for coming along with us on tonight's adventure.

6123
04:16:18.470 --> 04:16:22.780
Don't forget, we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

6124
04:16:22.780 --> 04:16:25.330
Good night!

6125
04:16:26.172 --> 04:16:29.839
(dramatic orchestral music)

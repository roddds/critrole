00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:02.828
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:04.175
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:05.965
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.615
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:09.515
MATT: Yep.

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:10.855
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:12.045
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.575
beginning with the first of our sponsors

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.225
of the evening, NordVPN.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.532
Travis?

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:19.132
TRAVIS: (panting)

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:22.475
Field testing the gonkulator, caps lock,

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.955
caps unlock, caps lock and key,

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:28.807
caps Loch Ness monster.

00:00:28.807 --> 00:00:31.253
(shouts)

00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:32.527
I'm sliced.

00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:34.093
(panting)

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:35.348
TALIESIN: Again.

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:36.885
TRAVIS: (panting) I can't do it.

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:38.245
TALIESIN: Again!

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:40.630
TRAVIS: I said I can't, Morpheus!

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.875
I know this is just training,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.148
but that was a QuadCore, C-quest cipher!

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:48.015
My Suddenly Susan protocols won't budge it.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.870
TALIESIN: Your haxxor name is Number Two,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.035
but that does not forgive a shitty attitude.

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:55.495
You must be ready, there is great danger--

00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:57.385
TRAVIS: I know, great danger coming, I know.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:01.705
But how will I be l33t enough to stop it?

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:02.578
TALIESIN: Observe.

00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:08.915
TRAVIS: Whoa!

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:12.215
Whoa, but you have a power glove, master.

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:14.356
I use my bare hands.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:16.006
TALIESIN: Negatronic.

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:18.956
You jack in with the strength of NordVPN,

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:21.435
providers of the highest quality encryption

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:22.495
for internet traffic.

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:25.215
And it hides your IP and physical location.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:28.025
Available on every major platform, including Windows,

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.755
iOS, Android, and Linux.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:32.685
Go to NordVPN.com/criticalrole

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.305
or use code criticalrole to get a two year plan

00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:38.945
plus one additional month at a discount.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:40.835
TRAVIS: Master, you already taught me

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:44.285
that with 5,400 servers in 59 countries,

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:46.187
it's easier to get better internet speed

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:48.155
and protection with one click.

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:50.855
TALIESIN: So what is it that's holding you back?

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:52.026
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:52.868
TALIESIN: Say it.

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:54.800
TRAVIS: I don't know!
TALIESIN: Say it!

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.779
TRAVIS: I'm scared, okay?

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.114
I'm scared of becoming

00:01:59.114 --> 00:02:04.114
a gleaming cube of cake like BlackWillow69@aol.com.

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:07.588
TALIESIN: Good.

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:10.048
TRAVIS: What?

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:12.961
TALIESIN: The two greatest forces of computing

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:15.445
are fear and love.

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:16.605
BlackWillow knew it.

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:18.196
So did the Ultra Kodex.

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:19.812
Use that fear,

00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:23.865
wire it into your synapses and reboot it into love.

00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:28.249
Turn ones and zeros into sixes and nines.

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.185
ASHLEY: Ooh.
LIAM: Nice.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.342
TRAVIS: I'll try, master.

00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:36.087
(breathing heavily)

00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:37.403
Ooh.

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:42.705
TALIESIN: Now, focus on Liam's camera feed,

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:46.505
seduce the encryption, hug the code.

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:49.525
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I can feel it.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:51.915
TALIESIN: Now, stick your thing in, flip it,

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.988
and reverse it with love.

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:57.524
(laughter)

00:02:57.524 --> 00:03:00.673
LIAM: Oh shit, my water!

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.038
Wait, why is nothing else on my table falling?

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:07.722
TRAVIS: Because I love you so damn much!

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:11.175
TALIESIN: Positronic! Next, Ashley and Marisha.

00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:14.058
Change their positions with your romantic hacking.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.478
ASHLEY: Ow!
MARISHA: Oh god!

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:18.982
ASHLEY: What the heck, ow.

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:21.762
TRAVIS: I'm doing it! I'm sorry, Ashley and Marisha,

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:24.350
I'm still new at this.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.495
MARISHA: No, it's okay, I guess.

00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:30.705
TALIESIN: Perfect strangers. Now do Laura.

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:33.860
TRAVIS: Wait, no, what if I hurt her?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.517
TALIESIN: You're scared, so harness that fear

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:39.135
into your magnificent hacker deltoids.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:42.745
Let it course through those l33t haptic biceps

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:45.251
and flex it to become--

00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.538
TRAVIS: Love! I did it!

00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:53.402
I hacked it with the power of love!

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:56.145
LAURA: Wow, that was amazing.

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:58.325
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I'm the only man

00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:00.891
you've ever loved, right?

00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:02.356
LAURA: Uh-huh.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.040
Mm-hmm.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.373
TALIESIN: Today, you have truly earned the name

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.014
"Number Two."

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:16.875
ALL: Whoa!

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:20.555
TRAVIS: Master, what was that?

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:22.638
TALIESIN: Oh, you'll find out...

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:25.071
next time NordVPN sponsors this show.

00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:27.058
Matt, hack to you.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:29.678
MATT: Wow.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:31.458
Thank you.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:34.752
This, I mean--

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:38.179
ASHLEY: What a bit.

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:39.487
MATT: Look out, Academy.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:44.487
(laughter)

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:46.166
MATT: Thank you, Travis.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:47.409
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.575
MATT: And thank you, NordVPN,

00:04:49.575 --> 00:04:52.860
for enabling-- for enabling.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.799
TRAVIS: Send a trophy to the POS box.

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.925
(laughter)

00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:58.530
MATT: Second sponsor for tonight--

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.638
LAURA: Did you say a POS box?

00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:01.051
TRAVIS: A Piece of Shit box, yeah.

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:05.425
(laughter)

00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:06.927
TRAVIS: We got one of those.

00:05:06.927 --> 00:05:08.615
MATT: Our second sponsor for tonight,

00:05:08.615 --> 00:05:11.395
our friends at Resolution Games.

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:14.475
This episode, you'll hear about me talking about

00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:16.465
Resolution Games and the new tabletop

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:19.678

00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:22.415
which is out now for the Oculus Quest platform

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:23.655
and VR headsets on Steam,

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:26.075
and coming shortly to the Oculus store and PC.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:29.125
Dark forces have taken over the underworld,

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.215
and it is up to you and your band of warriors

00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:34.865
to come together to defeat this unrelenting evil.

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:35.845
It's for up to four players,

00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:37.675
each assuming the roles of eagle-eyed hunter,

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:40.185
mystical sorcerer, deadly assassin, or protective guardian

00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:44.555
in a classic fantasy RPG experience all in VR.

00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:45.735
This is a living game.

00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:48.045
So they have a long content map plan

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:50.585
to ensure players have a steady supply of treasure

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.155
and glory for years to come.

00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:55.643

whether you're a player or DM, it's awesome.

You keep track of initiative and monsters

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:20.225
and dice rolls for the creatures, hit points,

00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:22.108
all the fun stuff. They have an early access feature

00:06:22.108 --> 00:06:23.995

if you would like to do so, and--

00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:47.535
MARISHA: More! More, talk more.

00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:50.157
MATT: No, why?

00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:51.193
TRAVIS: More talking!

00:06:51.193 --> 00:06:53.143
MATT: I'm actually pretty excited about this.

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.568
Now out from Darrington Press,

00:06:57.947 --> 00:06:59.080
Uk'otoa.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.474
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

00:07:01.474 --> 00:07:02.307
ASHLEY: Finally going to see it.

00:07:02.307 --> 00:07:04.124
TRAVIS: Look at that fucking--
MATT: Super excited about this.

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:06.625
MARISHA: Look how gorgeous!
MATT: So pretty.

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.195
It's available May 27th in the Critical Role shops

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.615
in the Darrington Press Guild stores,

00:07:10.615 --> 00:07:12.855
and soon after, in your local friendly game stores

00:07:12.855 --> 00:07:14.055
across the US.

00:07:14.055 --> 00:07:16.038
It is a tactical board game,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.685
dealing with a semi-cooperative card play

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:22.745
between factions of sailors that are vying

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:23.715
to be the last claimed

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:26.036
by the raging sea leviathan, Uk'otoa.

00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:27.378
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:28.745
MATT: Uk'otoa ravages your ship,

00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:31.065
and as it falls apart, you must push,

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.085
push, run, and sacrifice others

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.375
to be the last one standing.

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:35.565
It's awesome.
MARISHA: It's so fun.

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:38.897
MATT: And I hope you get a chance
to check it out and enjoy it.

00:07:38.897 --> 00:07:41.480

MATT: Marisha, you're up.

00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:49.665
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's me.

00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:52.495
The season finale of Narrative Telephone

00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:56.685
airs this Tuesday, May 18th at 4:00pm,

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:00.519
with a story from our very special guest, Aabria Iyengar.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:01.740
(cheering)

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.425
MARISHA: It's super fun.

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:04.285
It's so great.

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:05.375
If you missed the stream, you can check

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:09.495
out the VOD on YouTube on Thursday, May 20th.

00:08:09.495 --> 00:08:11.925
And this is the last one of this round.

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:15.972
We'll-- I don't know, we'll do more later.

00:08:15.972 --> 00:08:18.085
TRAVIS: At least we've gotten better as we go along.

00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:21.539
Definitely not gotten worse in any way.

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:22.372
MATT: Not at all.
SAM: It was just

00:08:22.372 --> 00:08:24.879
the same story, like, eight times.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.905
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.275
MARISHA: It's real boring; don't watch it.

00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:28.335
SAM: Yep. (laughs)

00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:30.113
(laughter)

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:30.946
MARISHA: No, it's great.

00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:31.813
It's probably one of my favorite ones

00:08:31.813 --> 00:08:33.455
we've actually done.

00:08:33.455 --> 00:08:34.405
It's really fun.

00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:35.365
MATT: Yeah, awesome.

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:36.722
Thank you, Marisha.

00:08:36.722 --> 00:08:37.745
And Ashley?

00:08:37.745 --> 00:08:39.798
ASHLEY: Oh hey, it's my turn.

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:42.865
I brought my glasses this time.

00:08:42.865 --> 00:08:45.745
Hey, thank you so much for your support

00:08:45.745 --> 00:08:48.125
of our Critical Role Foundation

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:51.965
fundraising campaign with 826LA,

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.395
our wonderful friends over there.

00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:54.895
We love them so much.

00:08:54.895 --> 00:08:56.995
So since we're pre-recording the show,

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.285
the best way to catch real-time fundraising updates

00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:03.398
is to follow us @CriticalRoleFDN

00:09:03.398 --> 00:09:04.648
is to follow us @CriticalRoleFDN

00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:06.045
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.785
And to learn more about our campaign

00:09:07.785 --> 00:09:09.645
to build a writer's room for students

00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:11.995
at Venice High School here in Los Angeles,

00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:16.995
or to donate, head on over to criticalrolefoundation.org.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.551
(cheering)

00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:21.517
LAURA: You called it, Ashley, that was real good.

00:09:21.517 --> 00:09:22.517
MARISHA: It was really good!

00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:23.350
ASHLEY: Listen.
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was great.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.466
ASHLEY: What's weird is how you know the information,

00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:28.263
but how it all goes away when you're trying

00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:29.827
to engage to a camera.

00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:30.660
MATT: Every time.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.693
TRAVIS: Stoked for that writer's room,

00:09:31.693 --> 00:09:33.590
it's going to be awesome.
ASHLEY: Stoked!

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.095
Ugh, it's going to be so cool.

00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:37.178
MATT: Thank you so much, Ashley.

00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:39.655
And thank you everybody who supported the campaign.

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:41.335
Get the word out there,

00:09:41.335 --> 00:09:42.995
share with your friends, and if you can

00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:44.695
and haven't had an opportunity yet but you can,

00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:46.195
help out, that'd be fantastic.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.765
I believe that's the last of our announcements.

00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:52.027
So that being the case,

00:09:52.027 --> 00:09:55.322
let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of

00:09:55.322 --> 00:09:57.600
Critical Role.

00:09:58.912 --> 00:10:01.396

MARISHA: -- bitch.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.773
MATT: And welcome back.

00:11:35.773 --> 00:11:38.313
(laughter)

00:11:38.313 --> 00:11:39.346
You know it's the end of the campaign,

00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:40.418
they're getting lazy.

00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:43.828
TRAVIS: Is that what it is?

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.735
TALIESIN: It's not lazy, it's--

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:46.985
MATT: I know.
ASHLEY: Terror.

00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:48.335
MATT: Last we left off:

00:11:49.968 --> 00:11:53.818
The Mighty Nein, after trudging through the ruins of Aeor

00:11:53.818 --> 00:11:55.725
with Essek at their side,

00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:59.055
chasing the tracks of the remaining two members

00:11:59.055 --> 00:12:01.815
of the Tomb Takers, Lucien and Cree.

00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:04.355
You traveled into the Genesis Ward,

00:12:04.355 --> 00:12:06.825
caught them at the Immensus Gate

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:08.705
where they managed to abscond beyond

00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:11.075
into the Astral Sea towards Cognouza,

00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:12.935
you giving immediate chase.

00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:14.535
One of you is a sheep, another one shrunk,

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:16.645
but you know, don't worry about it.

00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:18.365
(laughter)

00:12:18.365 --> 00:12:21.375
Upon arriving, discovered you are at

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:26.015
the floating monstrous city of Cognouza,

00:12:26.015 --> 00:12:27.813
the living mass

00:12:29.155 --> 00:12:32.303
that the Somnovem seem to be leading

00:12:33.165 --> 00:12:36.185
as it expands and consumes whatever comes across.

00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:37.955
You give chase to the two figures

00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:39.895
charging through the city as they divide off

00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:40.935
in different directions.

00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:41.995
You chose left.

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:44.395
Following that figure down into the street,

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:48.175
you saw denizens walking the cobblestone here.

00:12:48.175 --> 00:12:52.165
Though upon talking with them, they screamed.

00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:54.931
LAURA: (laughs) Yes.

00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:55.833
TRAVIS: (short screech)

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:57.955
MATT: You had a conversation

00:12:57.955 --> 00:13:01.005
with what seemed to be a couple of members of the Somnovem,

00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:05.088
separated and curious to converse,

00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:07.345
learn of your motives.

00:13:07.345 --> 00:13:11.965
And seemed to be at odds
with other members of their collective.

00:13:11.965 --> 00:13:16.495
You battled some of the street sufferers,

00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:19.195
I guess you could say, who then twisted

00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:23.788
into terrifying warped flesh and tooth and eye beings.

00:13:24.885 --> 00:13:26.665
Sought where the individual you were chasing

00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:28.355
may have gone and found tunnels

00:13:28.355 --> 00:13:32.615
beneath this city marketplace that led to

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:35.625
what looked to be a vault.

00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:39.335
Heading in that direction, making your way through

00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:43.725
a rock and flesh tunnel in the direction

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:47.205
of where it seemed one of these threshold volts might be,

00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:49.815
you hear footsteps in the darkness.

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:52.185
And as you all look forward,

00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:54.805
you realize you've come face-to-face

00:13:54.805 --> 00:13:59.288
with Cree Deeproots, of the Tomb Takers.

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:04.655
As you all take a moment to process

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:06.118
this sudden occurrence,

00:14:07.163 --> 00:14:09.160
Cree's eyes darts back and forth.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.993
"Shit."

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:12.895
I need you to roll initiative.

00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:16.435
TRAVIS: Oh, we're just fucking getting into it.
ASHLEY: We're just getting right in.

00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:17.465
MATT: Well, I guess I should ask first,

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:19.285
what was the order of travel in the tunnel?

00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:21.067
LAURA: Well, we were hiding in the folds.

00:14:21.067 --> 00:14:22.039
LIAM: The folds.

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:23.530
MATT: Right.
TRAVIS: The nasolabial folds.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.830
LAURA: Flesh folds.
SAM: Oh god.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.922
I think this combat is sponsored by Dwarven Forge,

00:14:27.922 --> 00:14:30.035
makers of premium handcrafted gaming terrain.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:32.715
Each hand-sculpted, twisted curve of Dwarven Forge terrain

00:14:32.715 --> 00:14:36.325
will drive you wild imagining what you could do with it.

00:14:36.325 --> 00:14:37.835
Bring your fantasies to life--

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:38.795
This sounds like porn--

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.569
at bit.ly/dwarvenforgecr.

00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:44.335
TRAVIS: Whoa! Okay.

00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:45.445
MATT: All right, so.

00:14:45.445 --> 00:14:46.278
TRAVIS: What's in the middle?

00:14:46.278 --> 00:14:49.155
MATT: Let me go ahead and initiative here.

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:51.302
LAURA: Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right.

00:14:51.302 --> 00:14:53.355
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: That's like, is that water?

00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:55.065
Is that fleshy?

00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:59.245
MATT: That is exposed, pulsing flesh.

00:14:59.245 --> 00:15:00.678
Amongst the rock elements.
TRAVIS: Sure, it is.

00:15:00.678 --> 00:15:03.471
LIAM: Yeah, I don't really like
the phrase "flesh tunnel" so much.

00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:04.895
(laughter)

00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:06.386
ASHLEY: I love it!

00:15:06.386 --> 00:15:07.452
(laughter)

00:15:07.452 --> 00:15:08.627
MATT: 25 to 20.

00:15:08.627 --> 00:15:10.403
LAURA: 20, 23.

00:15:10.403 --> 00:15:11.519
SAM: 20.
ASHLEY: 20.

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.907
SAM: 22 over here.

00:15:13.907 --> 00:15:17.075
TRAVIS: Jester. Nott. Yasha.

00:15:17.075 --> 00:15:18.989
I mean Veth. Fuck.

00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:20.430
MATT: Yasha, okay.

00:15:21.523 --> 00:15:23.145
LAURA: And wait, what was Yasha, what was Veth?

00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:24.095
TRAVIS: Jester, Veth...

00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:25.595
SANL 22 over here.

00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:27.585
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: 20 to 15.

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:29.075
TRAVIS: 17.
LIAM: 17.

00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:30.175
MARISHA: 15.

00:15:30.175 --> 00:15:31.008
MATT: Damn, all right.

00:15:31.008 --> 00:15:32.868
So which of you has the highest? I think that'd be Caleb.

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:33.975
TRAVIS: I have a zero dexterity.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.145
LIAM: I have a 12.

00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:36.738
TRAVIS: Yep, you're higher than me.
MARISHA: Wow.

00:15:38.073 --> 00:15:40.092
MATT: Fjord.
TRAVIS: Go figure.

00:15:40.092 --> 00:15:41.305
Beau.

00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:42.748
MATT: All right. Caduceus?

00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:43.581
TALIESIN: 13.

00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:48.691
LIAM: What were the first three? Jester, who, who?

00:15:48.691 --> 00:15:50.825
TRAVIS: Jester, Veth, Yasha.
LIAM: Thank you.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.265
MATT: So where were you hiding?

00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:53.375
You would say you guys would be

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:56.015
in this region when this all occurred.

00:15:56.015 --> 00:15:58.428
TRAVIS: I made myself look like somebody, didn't I?

00:15:59.385 --> 00:16:02.325
LAURA: Oh yeah, you were like
one of the denizens of the city.

00:16:02.325 --> 00:16:04.887
MARISHA: Like the old woman, or something like that.

00:16:04.887 --> 00:16:05.845
LIAM: The giant eye, right?

00:16:05.845 --> 00:16:07.324
Didn't you make your face an eye?

00:16:07.324 --> 00:16:09.565
TRAVIS: I did, during the fight.

00:16:09.565 --> 00:16:10.605
Not in this one, though.

00:16:10.605 --> 00:16:13.397
Just like unseeing and walking forward like the old woman

00:16:13.397 --> 00:16:15.775
that was in the square.
LAURA: Oh, that's right, that's right.

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:16.608
MATT: I will put you there.

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.445
Then out in the open, is that what you're saying?

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:21.057
TRAVIS: Uh yeah, that's what my dumb ass decided to do.

00:16:21.057 --> 00:16:22.107
MATT: Okay.

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:24.425
LAURA: I imagine I'd be in a fold.

00:16:24.425 --> 00:16:26.085
Can I-- Where are the folds?

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:27.884
MATT: There's a fold there.
SAM: Gross.

00:16:27.884 --> 00:16:28.983
MATT: There's fold there.
SAM: Gross.

00:16:28.983 --> 00:16:29.891
MATT: There's a fold here.

00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:30.865
SAM: Also gross.
MARISHA: I'll take that.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:33.685
I'll take that second fold you pointed out.

00:16:33.685 --> 00:16:34.518
MATT: Here?

00:16:34.518 --> 00:16:35.758
MARISHA: No, that one, yep.

00:16:36.716 --> 00:16:41.716
LIAM: I'll take an
anal gland near Jester.

00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:43.468
MATT: Near Jester, right there.

00:16:45.055 --> 00:16:47.831
Okay, Yasha, Veth, Caduceus?

00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:50.061
ASHLEY: If there's an extra fold?

00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:53.005
(laughter)

00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:54.785
TRAVIS: (Cockney accent) The fold's taken.

00:16:54.785 --> 00:16:58.185
(laughter)

00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:00.970
MARISHA: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going to die.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.882
MATT: There are two more.

00:17:02.882 --> 00:17:04.297
There are two more folds.

00:17:04.297 --> 00:17:06.065
(laughter)

00:17:06.065 --> 00:17:07.358
Two more folds back here.

00:17:08.408 --> 00:17:09.241
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:17:09.241 --> 00:17:11.905
(laughs)

00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:13.520
That really got me.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.155
Okay, maybe a little closer to--

00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:20.050
Cree was coming in from this way?

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:20.883
MATT: In this direction.

00:17:20.883 --> 00:17:22.415
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so let me...

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:27.005
Kind of near, yeah, that's right around there.
MARISHA: You can fit here, if you want.

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.192
ASHLEY: I feel like I was a little close to Beau.

00:17:29.192 --> 00:17:31.502
MATT: Okay, Veth, Caduceus?
MARISHA: Share my fold.

00:17:31.502 --> 00:17:34.095
ASHLEY: (Cockney accent) Fold's taken.

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.515
SAM: I can be anywhere, so.

00:17:35.515 --> 00:17:36.705
TALIESIN: I'll go in that last fold, then.
MATT: Essek's going to be hiding

00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:37.935
back behind that piece there.

00:17:37.935 --> 00:17:39.325
You're going to the last fold?

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:41.205
TALIESIN: Yeah, that last available fold.

00:17:41.205 --> 00:17:42.205
MATT: You got it.

00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:44.427
Now all the folds are taken.

00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:45.418
Veth, where are you at?

00:17:45.418 --> 00:17:46.774
SAM: If all the folds are taken,

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:50.605
I can use Yasha's body as cover.

00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:51.794
MATT: That's true.
SAM: And just hide behind her.

00:17:51.794 --> 00:17:53.333
LAURA: There's also a little thing sticking up

00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.325
in the middle there.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:56.595
SAM: That could be a penis or something.

00:17:56.595 --> 00:17:58.319
I don't know.
LAURA: That's true.

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:00.208
SAM: All right, I'll go behind the penis.

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:02.725
MATT: What?
SAM: It's a penis.

00:18:02.725 --> 00:18:04.985
(laughter)

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:06.712
TRAVIS: You mean the little stalag?

00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:08.378
SAM: The stalagmite, stalactite.
LIAM: Rock formation.

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:10.720
MATT: Yeah, mostly rock.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.603
SAM and LAURA: "Mostly rock."

00:18:11.603 --> 00:18:13.373
LIAM: I mean, it is somewhat flesh, so.

00:18:13.373 --> 00:18:14.690
MATT: Yeah.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.275
All right, and there's where Cree

00:18:17.275 --> 00:18:20.128
had stopped upon realizing.

00:18:21.805 --> 00:18:23.188
Top of the round.

00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:26.955
TRAVIS: Is that Cree right, just across

00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:29.135
the open, exposed flesh area?

00:18:29.135 --> 00:18:30.753
SAM: Yeah, the flesh puddle.

00:18:30.753 --> 00:18:31.586
MATT: Yes.

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:34.478
SAM: The skin pond.

00:18:34.478 --> 00:18:36.275
MATT: Jester, you're up.
Veth, you're on deck.

00:18:36.275 --> 00:18:37.691
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question? Is the puddle,

00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:39.405
I'm sorry, the open, exposed flesh.

00:18:39.405 --> 00:18:42.163
It <i>looks</i> solid?

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.943
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Or does it look liquid?

00:18:43.943 --> 00:18:46.615
MATT: It looks solid in the way
that a waterbed is solid.

00:18:46.615 --> 00:18:47.448
LAURA: Gross!

00:18:47.448 --> 00:18:51.595
TRAVIS: Is it reflective and shimmering,
or like matte dry look?

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:53.336
MATT: There's no light in here, really, it's hard to tell.

00:18:53.336 --> 00:18:55.121
LAURA: So it looks like skin.

00:18:55.121 --> 00:18:56.155
It just looks like flesh.

00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:57.585
LIAM: That could do anything.

00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:01.105
TRAVIS: That's exactly right. Anything. Absolutely anything.

00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:02.415
MATT: Well, you're up, Jester.

00:19:02.415 --> 00:19:03.265
SAM: Oh my god.

00:19:03.265 --> 00:19:06.755
LAURA: How can I--
About how long is this tunnel?

00:19:06.755 --> 00:19:08.055
MATT: How long is it?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:19:09.145 --> 00:19:10.555
MATT: It goes on continually for--

00:19:10.555 --> 00:19:12.615
LAURA: On and on and on. We saw--

00:19:12.615 --> 00:19:14.615
MATT: You traveled like a few hundred feet

00:19:14.615 --> 00:19:16.835
from this direction, and you don't know how far

00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:17.668
it goes that way.

00:19:17.668 --> 00:19:18.501
LAURA: Okay, but we did see

00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:20.015
we can see light at the end of the tunnel.

00:19:20.015 --> 00:19:20.995
You said we saw light.

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:24.055
MATT: A very, very faint bit of blue light.

00:19:24.055 --> 00:19:24.888
LAURA: Okay.

00:19:25.845 --> 00:19:28.375
SAM: Can we see how far that blue light is roughly?

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:30.595
Like between two and 500 feet,

00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:33.385
or five and a thousand feet, or--?

00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:37.025
MATT: It's probably within a hundred or 200 feet-ish.

00:19:37.025 --> 00:19:38.075
Not too terribly far.

00:19:40.225 --> 00:19:45.225
LAURA: I'm going to then look over at Caleb.

00:19:46.115 --> 00:19:46.948
Say:

00:19:48.673 --> 00:19:49.906
Want to take a trip?

00:19:49.906 --> 00:19:50.785
LIAM: Oh!

00:19:50.785 --> 00:19:52.875
LAURA: I'm just going to grab his arm and Polymorph--

00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.995
Not Polymorph us, Dimension Door us.

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:56.875
MATT: You're going to Dimension Door?

00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:58.975
LAURA: I'm going to Dimension Door me and Caleb

00:20:01.585 --> 00:20:03.675
towards the blue light.

00:20:03.675 --> 00:20:04.508
MATT: Okay.

00:20:06.435 --> 00:20:08.935
You reach over and grab Caleb, and (whoosh).

00:20:08.935 --> 00:20:11.315
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's a good idea.
MATT: Vanish.

00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:13.109
LIAM: So he said, "Oh," here, and when they reappear

00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:14.759
he's going to say: Yeah.

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:19.565
MATT: So you grab Caleb and both of you dart through

00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:20.725
that direction of the light.

00:20:20.725 --> 00:20:23.265
You both apparate

00:20:23.265 --> 00:20:25.675
about a foot above the ground
and catch yourself as you land.

00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:28.235
You are now standing in the middle of

00:20:28.235 --> 00:20:30.195
a somewhat different arrangement

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:33.185
of a familiar threshold vault.

00:20:33.185 --> 00:20:35.555
You can see the dual staircases
that come down in the middle.

00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:36.745
There's the upper platform.

00:20:36.745 --> 00:20:38.635
You both are right at the bottom of the stairs.

00:20:38.635 --> 00:20:39.468
At the floor in the middle,

00:20:39.468 --> 00:20:41.805
you see the same sigil
that marks the floor

00:20:41.805 --> 00:20:43.355
that leads up to the ceiling portion.

00:20:43.355 --> 00:20:45.295
Though the floor is broken open in places,

00:20:45.295 --> 00:20:47.585
and you can see bits of exposed muscle

00:20:47.585 --> 00:20:49.565
and fleshy strident texture,

00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:51.625
pulsing and moving beneath it.

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.325
And looking around the chamber itself,

00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:54.865
the architecture, it's odd.

00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:57.005
As you take in the space around you, it's familiar,

00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:58.255
but everything is bent.

00:20:58.255 --> 00:20:59.355
Everything is a bit twisted.

00:20:59.355 --> 00:21:00.605
The arches are warped.

00:21:00.605 --> 00:21:02.075
And for a brief moment, you feel yourself

00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:03.368
having to fight vertigo

00:21:03.368 --> 00:21:04.505
of trying to figure out

00:21:04.505 --> 00:21:09.468
which way is the right way to be standing in this space.

00:21:10.675 --> 00:21:11.959
But that's your action.

00:21:11.959 --> 00:21:13.258
LAURA: Okay.

00:21:13.258 --> 00:21:14.994
MATT: All right, anything else you want to do on your turn?

00:21:16.325 --> 00:21:18.075
LAURA: Can I see the threshold crest?

00:21:18.075 --> 00:21:23.005
MATT: You look up, and you see about 25 feet up in the air,

00:21:23.005 --> 00:21:25.015
embedded in the ceiling.

00:21:25.015 --> 00:21:29.535
You see the massive, somewhat circular threshold crest

00:21:29.535 --> 00:21:32.355
giving that dull, familiar, bluish glow.

00:21:32.355 --> 00:21:34.218
And it is set into its stone

00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:37.485
its stone facing in the ceiling itself.

00:21:37.485 --> 00:21:40.665
Though you can watch the lip of it twitch in places,

00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:42.927
like a mouth that is currently full.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:44.060
LAURA: It's going to hold onto it.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.065
I just look at Caleb and say: We have to get it out.

00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:47.898
LIAM: Okay.

00:21:49.735 --> 00:21:51.365
MATT: Well, that finishes Jester's go.

00:21:51.365 --> 00:21:52.664
Veth, you're up.
Yasha, you're on deck.

00:21:52.664 --> 00:21:53.589
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:55.739
SAM: When Cree approached us,

00:21:57.105 --> 00:22:01.005
we don't know if she saw some of us, all of us?

00:22:01.005 --> 00:22:02.595
Did she make eye contact?

00:22:02.595 --> 00:22:03.428
MATT: You don't know.

00:22:03.428 --> 00:22:04.795
SAM: We don't know, but we were,

00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:06.082
we were sort of hiding.

00:22:06.082 --> 00:22:08.748
MATT: She stopped and said, "Shit."

00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:12.885
Which means she seems to be aware

00:22:12.885 --> 00:22:15.083
that something is here.

00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.325
It would be your guess as to how perceptive she is

00:22:18.325 --> 00:22:19.855
and to what she has noticed.

00:22:19.855 --> 00:22:23.565
SAM: Okay, well then, I'm going to hope that I'm hidden

00:22:23.565 --> 00:22:24.825
and I'm going to--

00:22:24.825 --> 00:22:26.645
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me.
SAM: Okay.

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:27.995
MATT: Like you need to, but still.

00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:29.605
SAM: Yeah, no I could.

00:22:29.605 --> 00:22:30.575
They're both bad rolls,

00:22:30.575 --> 00:22:33.286
so I'll take my 25.

00:22:33.286 --> 00:22:34.525
MATT: Okay.

00:22:34.525 --> 00:22:35.656
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:37.025
MATT: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:22:37.025 --> 00:22:38.555
MATT: Yeah.

00:22:38.555 --> 00:22:40.465
SAM: And I'm going to hope I'm hidden

00:22:40.465 --> 00:22:42.555
and just sort of inch around.

00:22:42.555 --> 00:22:47.165
Bonus action, cast Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt on my bolt.

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:48.265
MATT: You've got it.

00:22:48.265 --> 00:22:50.905
SAM: And fire it and hope it hits.

00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:51.845
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: Here we go.

00:22:51.845 --> 00:22:54.535
SAM: 12 plus 11.

00:22:54.535 --> 00:22:56.125
So that's a 23 to hit.

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.695
MATT: That does hit.

00:22:57.695 --> 00:22:59.335
SAM: And sneak attack?

00:22:59.335 --> 00:23:00.768
TRAVIS: No going back now.
MATT: You were hidden.

00:23:00.768 --> 00:23:02.195
SAM: Yes!

00:23:02.195 --> 00:23:03.215
TRAVIS: Let's go, rogues!

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.815
SAM: All right.

00:23:04.815 --> 00:23:06.081
All the dice.
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness,

00:23:06.081 --> 00:23:08.289
that is so many dice.
SAM: Uh-huh.

00:23:08.289 --> 00:23:09.363
TRAVIS: Are they high numbers? Are they high numbers?

00:23:09.363 --> 00:23:11.047
SAM: Yes, they are.
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:12.788
SAM: 30.

00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:14.579
Ooh!

00:23:17.025 --> 00:23:17.958
Plus.

00:23:20.045 --> 00:23:20.878
Oh man.

00:23:22.028 --> 00:23:23.469
60 points of damage.

00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:26.835
(cheering)

00:23:26.835 --> 00:23:28.985
TRAVIS: If you had critted on that--!

00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:30.293
MATT: Yeah, rogues, man.

00:23:30.293 --> 00:23:32.071
SAM: That was a lot of fives and sixes.

00:23:32.071 --> 00:23:33.437
ASHLEY: Holy mackerel.
MARISHA: Amazing.

00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:35.535
ASHLEY: That was amazing.
SAM: Yeah!

00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:36.368
MATT: All right.

00:23:37.225 --> 00:23:41.242
The instant that everyone stops
in that weird showdown pause

00:23:41.242 --> 00:23:44.505
right as you see Cree
getting ready to do something.

00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:48.299
You dart out from behind that rock structure, fire, and

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:51.582
whatever momentum Cree was initiating,

00:23:51.582 --> 00:23:55.405
shifts into a spin grab into the mid-torso.

00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:58.805
As you see the impact actually sends her onto the back foot.

00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:00.605
And right now she looks like,

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.788
just wasn't expecting such a

00:24:03.788 --> 00:24:07.425
extremely deadly impact so soon.

00:24:07.425 --> 00:24:08.695
So that's your action.

00:24:08.695 --> 00:24:09.528
TRAVIS: Good job.

00:24:09.528 --> 00:24:12.272
SAM: Yeah, I'm not--
MATT: Your bonus and your action.

00:24:12.272 --> 00:24:14.239
So you have movement.
SAM: Yeah, who's right in front of me?

00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:15.565
MATT: Fjord is.

00:24:15.565 --> 00:24:16.398
SAM: Okay.

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:18.987
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) I'm an old woman.

00:24:18.987 --> 00:24:20.103
SAM: I'm trying to think if like she has

00:24:20.103 --> 00:24:22.665
some sort of, like, cone-type attack.

00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:23.705
I don't want to be in the cone.

00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:25.125
I hate cones.

00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:27.195
I'm going to move forward and to the right

00:24:27.195 --> 00:24:28.645
and try to find a fold.

00:24:28.645 --> 00:24:31.135
Like, maybe one of the folds where Jester used to be.

00:24:31.135 --> 00:24:33.245
Or, I don't know, just forward to the right.

00:24:33.245 --> 00:24:34.645
MATT: Okay.
SAM: As far as I can go.

00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:36.434
MATT: Just sneak into that space there.
SAM: Okay, great.

00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:38.155
MATT: All righty, that finishes your go?

00:24:38.155 --> 00:24:39.015
SAM: Yep.

00:24:39.015 --> 00:24:39.848
MATT: All righty.

00:24:40.935 --> 00:24:43.275
TALIESIN: So you don't get sneak attack next round, then.

00:24:43.275 --> 00:24:45.865
SAM: No, not unless I can come by

00:24:45.865 --> 00:24:47.542
and someone else gets near her.

00:24:47.542 --> 00:24:49.508
MATT: Yasha, you're up.
Caleb, you're on deck.

00:24:49.508 --> 00:24:50.493
ASHLEY: All right.

00:24:52.295 --> 00:24:54.135
Well, I'm going to fucking rage,

00:24:54.135 --> 00:24:55.820
for starters.
TRAVIS: (excited yelling)

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.425
ASHLEY: (growls)
SAM: Habadahoobada.

00:24:57.425 --> 00:24:58.479
ASHLEY: Habadahoobada.
TALIESIN: Hoobadahabada.

00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:00.653
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to start making my way.

00:25:00.653 --> 00:25:01.615
ALL: ♪ Makin' my way! ♪

00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:04.575
ASHLEY: Over to this bish.

00:25:04.575 --> 00:25:06.919
TRAVIS: Almost harmonized.

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:10.185
MATT: All right, yeah, you just go charging along the path.

00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:11.282
ASHLEY: Holy Avenger, take a swing.

00:25:11.282 --> 00:25:13.845
MATT: Could you make a dexterity
saving throw for me, please?

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.355
ASHLEY: Yes.
SAM: Oh, oh no.

00:25:15.355 --> 00:25:16.405
LAURA: A what, a what?

00:25:16.405 --> 00:25:18.065
SAM: A dexterity saving throw because

00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:19.947
fleshy puddles are probably going to reach out

00:25:19.947 --> 00:25:21.795
and try to--
MARISHA: ♪ Reach out and-- ♪

00:25:21.795 --> 00:25:22.660
ASHLEY: Natural 20.
MARISHA: ♪ -- touch me ♪

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.202
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MARISHA: Ooh!

00:25:24.202 --> 00:25:25.035
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to leave that.

00:25:25.035 --> 00:25:25.868
TRAVIS: It's the fringe.

00:25:25.868 --> 00:25:27.065
ASHLEY: Okay, okay,

00:25:27.065 --> 00:25:28.240
okay.
SAM: It is the fringe.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.455
ASHLEY: Let's throw this one, okay.

00:25:30.455 --> 00:25:31.288
SAM: Hot damn.

00:25:31.288 --> 00:25:32.595
ASHLEY: Okay, great.

00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:35.257
That would be--

00:25:35.257 --> 00:25:36.665
well, 20 total.

00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:37.498
MATT: 20 hits.

00:25:37.498 --> 00:25:38.655
SAM: Ooh, okay.

00:25:38.655 --> 00:25:39.488
She's going down.

00:25:39.488 --> 00:25:41.685
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:45.918
Okay.

00:25:49.094 --> 00:25:50.694
I'm going to do Savage Attacker.

00:25:53.317 --> 00:25:54.375
That's lower, okay.

00:25:57.505 --> 00:25:59.555
Let me do a little addition here.

00:25:59.555 --> 00:26:02.148
SAM: She made Caleb and Jester disappear!

00:26:03.215 --> 00:26:04.365
TRAVIS: Hey Matt, is there anybody on--

00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:05.724
SAM: Oh my god!

00:26:05.724 --> 00:26:07.807
(laughter)

00:26:09.165 --> 00:26:10.689
ASHLEY: 34 points of damage.

00:26:10.689 --> 00:26:12.705
MATT: Nice.
SAM: Ooh, ooh, ooh!

00:26:12.705 --> 00:26:14.675
We're approaching triple digits on the first round.

00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:15.588
ASHLEY: Second hit.

00:26:19.655 --> 00:26:22.325
That would be 18.

00:26:22.325 --> 00:26:23.703
MATT: 18 just misses.

00:26:23.703 --> 00:26:24.903
(groaning)

00:26:24.903 --> 00:26:25.753
TRAVIS: 19 AC,

00:26:25.753 --> 00:26:26.601
sounds like.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:28.105
Okay.
TRAVIS: Could be.

00:26:28.105 --> 00:26:29.265
ASHLEY: All right.
MATT: I'm sorry.

00:26:29.265 --> 00:26:30.358
ASHLEY: Nope, it's fine.

00:26:32.525 --> 00:26:34.559
MATT: All righty, does that finish your turn?

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.185
MARISHA: So 19, you think?

00:26:36.185 --> 00:26:38.015
TRAVIS: I think.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:39.245
ASHLEY: That finishes--

00:26:39.245 --> 00:26:40.715
TRAVIS: She said 18, he said just missed.

00:26:40.715 --> 00:26:42.435
ASHLEY: -- my turn.

00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:44.315
Let me check something real quick.

00:26:44.315 --> 00:26:45.275
Oh yeah, already used it.

00:26:45.275 --> 00:26:46.108
That's my turn.

00:26:46.108 --> 00:26:47.195
MATT: All right, Yasha's done.

00:26:47.195 --> 00:26:48.028
Caleb, you're up.

00:26:48.028 --> 00:26:49.105
Fjord, you're on deck.

00:26:49.105 --> 00:26:51.395
LIAM: Okay, in the split second that we arrive,

00:26:51.395 --> 00:26:53.035
I want to see two things really quick.

00:26:53.035 --> 00:26:54.635
One, is there any writing anywhere,

00:26:54.635 --> 00:26:57.155
and two, about how high is the ceiling and the gem

00:26:57.155 --> 00:26:57.988
above our heads?

00:26:57.988 --> 00:26:58.821
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:26:58.821 --> 00:26:59.654
LIAM: Yeah.

00:27:02.145 --> 00:27:03.425
SAM: You reached seven different directions.

00:27:03.425 --> 00:27:05.045
LIAM: I did, yes.

00:27:05.045 --> 00:27:06.438
Infinite possibilities.

00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:08.118
20.

00:27:08.118 --> 00:27:09.325
MATT: 20.

00:27:09.325 --> 00:27:11.135
You do not see any writing immediately,

00:27:11.135 --> 00:27:13.035
you just see the various runic symbols

00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:15.285
on the center of the chamber that lead across the floor

00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:16.645
to the back wall and up.

00:27:16.645 --> 00:27:18.955
That is part of the apparatus that is designed

00:27:18.955 --> 00:27:21.435
to utilize the threshold crests

00:27:21.435 --> 00:27:24.165
that you recall from the previous ruins of Aeor.

00:27:24.165 --> 00:27:27.820
It is embedded about 20, 25 feet above you.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.967
LIAM: 20 to 25 feet.
MATT: Correct.

00:27:31.245 --> 00:27:32.078
LIAM: Back up, back up

00:27:32.078 --> 00:27:34.615
and I just sort of nudge back and get out from under it

00:27:34.615 --> 00:27:35.935
if we're under it.

00:27:35.935 --> 00:27:37.095
MATT: You're not directly under it.

00:27:37.095 --> 00:27:39.035
It's about maybe 10 feet out from where you're standing.

00:27:39.035 --> 00:27:42.105
LIAM: Okay, and I draw the dust on my arm

00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:45.425
and I cast Disintegrate all along the lining

00:27:45.425 --> 00:27:47.005
holding the gem in place.

00:27:47.005 --> 00:27:49.189
MARISHA: Cool.
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:50.395
SAM: Cool.
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:27:53.143 --> 00:27:55.195
SAM: Oh, Matt's going to the phone.

00:27:55.195 --> 00:27:58.221
Putting in a quick order at Door Dash.

00:27:58.221 --> 00:28:00.945
(laughter)

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:02.468
MATT: Look, it's been a day.

00:28:02.468 --> 00:28:04.935
(laughter)

00:28:04.935 --> 00:28:06.691
SAM: Need some carnitas.

00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:10.295
LIAM: Can you get me some nachos, Matt?

00:28:10.295 --> 00:28:11.128
MATT: All righty.

00:28:12.871 --> 00:28:14.618
LAURA: Why does it always think I'm standing?

00:28:14.618 --> 00:28:18.905
MATT: (laughs) As you go ahead and
hit the side of the stone,

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:21.235
you watch as--

00:28:21.235 --> 00:28:23.955
You're used to seeing stone just turn to dust.

00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:26.605
Instead, you see flesh wither black,

00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:29.015
the ceiling suddenly curling like a wound

00:28:29.015 --> 00:28:30.555
that immediately festers.

00:28:30.555 --> 00:28:32.705
And you can see the stone and the room around you

00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:35.798
begins to twitch and shift in pain.

00:28:37.207 --> 00:28:38.465
LAURA: It didn't like that.

00:28:40.155 --> 00:28:44.225
MATT: The stone, you see, part of it begins to fall loose.

00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:47.145
Tendrils like (flitting) begin and try and grab around it

00:28:47.145 --> 00:28:48.545
like little tethers,

00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:50.585
and it's now dangling and swinging

00:28:50.585 --> 00:28:52.345
about five feet below the opening,

00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:56.155
and you see it's trying to pull it back up,

00:28:56.155 --> 00:28:58.113
but it's much looser than it was.

00:28:58.113 --> 00:28:59.355
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
LIAM: We need to

00:28:59.355 --> 00:29:01.060
grab that dingleberry.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.438
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's exactly what I was thinking!

00:29:04.438 --> 00:29:06.515
SAM: It's on by maybe two hairs.

00:29:06.515 --> 00:29:07.965
MATT: Do you want to stay put or?

00:29:08.865 --> 00:29:10.835
You have the two curving stairs behind you

00:29:10.835 --> 00:29:11.935
that lead up towards the entrance

00:29:11.935 --> 00:29:13.355
to the chamber.
LIAM: I'll go halfway up

00:29:13.355 --> 00:29:14.625
one set of stairway.

00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:15.975
MATT: Okay, the right or left one?

00:29:15.975 --> 00:29:16.935
LIAM: Let's say the left.

00:29:16.935 --> 00:29:17.855
MATT: All right, you're back.

00:29:17.855 --> 00:29:19.935
You back up towards the left stair.

00:29:19.935 --> 00:29:20.768
You've got it, all right.

00:29:20.768 --> 00:29:21.601
Finishing Caleb's go.

00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:23.325
Fjord, you're up.

00:29:23.325 --> 00:29:26.295
TRAVIS: I will try to close the distance on Cree as well,

00:29:26.295 --> 00:29:29.265
but I'll go the opposite side of the pond

00:29:29.265 --> 00:29:32.645
to make my way there with 30 feet of movement.

00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:34.937
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: So I'll walk around the pond.

00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:35.885
MATT: Walk around the pond?

00:29:35.885 --> 00:29:37.655
TRAVIS: Yeah, the flesh pond?

00:29:37.655 --> 00:29:38.488
MATT: Yeah. Could you make a

00:29:38.488 --> 00:29:39.785
dexterity saving throw for me, please?

00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:41.575
TRAVIS: Oh, just from being close?

00:29:41.575 --> 00:29:42.475
MATT: Correct.

00:29:42.475 --> 00:29:44.225
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I should have just gone.

00:29:45.335 --> 00:29:47.448
Oh, these are not-- Oh, come on, come on, come on.

00:29:48.627 --> 00:29:50.805
(groaning) 10.

00:29:50.805 --> 00:29:52.230
MATT: 10.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.705
(whoosh)

00:29:53.705 --> 00:29:56.925
As you get close, elements of it wrap out

00:29:56.925 --> 00:29:58.245
and grab at your feet.

00:29:58.245 --> 00:30:00.625
You try and kick it off and then three more (whooshing)

00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:02.825
grab and pull you in.

00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:04.695
You're now about ankle deep

00:30:04.695 --> 00:30:08.065
in this weird, doughy surface.

00:30:08.065 --> 00:30:09.545
And it's not hurting you,

00:30:09.545 --> 00:30:11.585
but your movement is reduced to zero.

00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:12.715
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

00:30:12.715 --> 00:30:14.655
With my bonus action, I will reach out

00:30:14.655 --> 00:30:17.255
and I will cast Hexblade's Curse on Cree.

00:30:17.255 --> 00:30:19.405
MATT: Oh damn, okay.
LAURA: Yes.

00:30:19.405 --> 00:30:21.235
SAM: Hexblade's Curse!

00:30:21.235 --> 00:30:23.731
LIAM: Dark warlock. (grunting)

00:30:23.731 --> 00:30:24.662
MATT: Hexed.

00:30:24.662 --> 00:30:27.325
TRAVIS: Are my arms free to cast?

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:28.158
Or am I-- okay?
MATT: Yeah.

00:30:28.158 --> 00:30:29.395
It's just your ankles and legs.

00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:32.665
You got dragged in and you're still standing,

00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.965
you're just ankle deep in skin.

00:30:34.965 --> 00:30:36.665
TRAVIS: Ankle deep! I will send

00:30:36.665 --> 00:30:38.965
three Eldritch Blasts towards Cree.
SAM: ♪ I'm still standing ♪

00:30:38.965 --> 00:30:39.798
MATT: Go for it.

00:30:40.865 --> 00:30:42.805
TRAVIS: First one is a 24.

00:30:42.805 --> 00:30:43.638
MATT: That hits.

00:30:44.595 --> 00:30:46.145
TRAVIS: Second one is a 27.

00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:47.295
MATT: That hits.

00:30:47.295 --> 00:30:48.589
TRAVIS: And last one is a 28!

00:30:48.589 --> 00:30:50.372
MATT: They all hit, go for it.
TRAVIS: Wow, that's amazing.

00:30:50.372 --> 00:30:52.055
None of them were 19s which would have been a crit,

00:30:52.055 --> 00:30:53.288
you bastard, fuck you!

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.283
TALIESIN: (laughs)

00:30:56.425 --> 00:31:00.555
TRAVIS: Three, 10, 13, that's 15 points of force damage.

00:31:00.555 --> 00:31:01.388
MATT: Nice.

00:31:03.925 --> 00:31:06.875
TRAVIS: That's nine-- 10 points of force damage.

00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:07.708
MATT: Okay.

00:31:09.745 --> 00:31:11.565
TRAVIS: 14 points of force damage.

00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:13.210
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: Nice!

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.395
TRAVIS: Boof, boof, boof!
SAM: Dead yet?

00:31:15.395 --> 00:31:17.165
MATT: No.
SAM: (sighs)

00:31:17.165 --> 00:31:19.978
MATT: But she's starting to look hurt. (laughs)

00:31:21.285 --> 00:31:23.945
From the blasts from you, the impact from Yasha

00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:25.555
and now the (whooshing),

00:31:25.555 --> 00:31:27.988
and the shadows gathering around and clinging to it,

00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:31.215
there's a weird, vine-like tether of the curse.

00:31:31.215 --> 00:31:34.975
It's moving between her armor and her clothes.

00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:37.067
Cree is like (grunting).

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:40.095
The red cloak now being grabbed on one hand

00:31:40.095 --> 00:31:42.935
and hand forward towards whoever's coming nearby.

00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:44.598
That finishes your turn.

00:31:45.645 --> 00:31:46.905
Fjord?

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.195
All right, it's now Essek's go.

00:31:49.195 --> 00:31:50.028
TALIESIN: Yay.

00:31:51.518 --> 00:31:52.975
SAM: Oh yeah, we got Essek.

00:31:52.975 --> 00:31:54.215
TRAVIS: Let's go, Essek!
SAM: We're going to win!

00:31:54.215 --> 00:31:55.065
TRAVIS: Let's go!

00:31:55.065 --> 00:31:56.665
MATT: Essek is going to go ahead and

00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:02.865
30 about there, and just glide forward,

00:32:02.865 --> 00:32:05.518
and is going to go ahead and cast,

00:32:07.685 --> 00:32:08.815
let's say...

00:32:13.854 --> 00:32:15.314
Hmm.

00:32:15.314 --> 00:32:17.135
Everyone's in a line right there.

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:19.985
He's going to go ahead and cast Magic Missile

00:32:19.985 --> 00:32:21.835
at 4th-level.

00:32:21.835 --> 00:32:24.065
SAM: Nice.
MATT: No, let's go 5th-level.

00:32:24.065 --> 00:32:26.342
TRAVIS and SAM: Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:31.248
MATT: Just to make sure it doesn't miss.

00:32:45.715 --> 00:32:47.335
Cool.

00:32:47.335 --> 00:32:51.218
29 points of force damage to Cree from Essek.

00:32:52.772 --> 00:32:53.945
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:32:53.945 --> 00:32:57.335
MATT: In the darkness here, there's this faint flash

00:32:57.335 --> 00:32:59.735
of dark purplish energy that crackles

00:32:59.735 --> 00:33:04.175
as multitudes of darts, eight in particular.

00:33:04.175 --> 00:33:05.008
SAM: Damn!

00:33:05.008 --> 00:33:06.935
MATT: (whooshing) Go and arc around,

00:33:06.935 --> 00:33:09.965
going past Fjord and underneath the arm and the armor,

00:33:09.965 --> 00:33:11.535
going right around you, Yasha,

00:33:11.535 --> 00:33:14.935
and just colliding at multiple points around Cree

00:33:14.935 --> 00:33:18.025
and you just feel this mild splash on your face

00:33:18.025 --> 00:33:21.055
as elements of Cree's body have now just been blown apart

00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:22.255
in places at the shoulder.

00:33:25.387 --> 00:33:26.842
That's going to finish Essek's go.

00:33:26.842 --> 00:33:28.255
(laughter)

00:33:28.255 --> 00:33:30.625
(as Essek) "Quick, get to her!"

00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:32.847
Beauregard, you're up.
Caduceus, you're on deck.

00:33:32.847 --> 00:33:36.200
MARISHA: I just go: Yep! And I get to her.

00:33:37.085 --> 00:33:37.977
Because I can.

00:33:37.977 --> 00:33:40.252
SAM: (quick footsteps)

00:33:41.095 --> 00:33:42.375
MARISHA: Okay, and can I--

00:33:43.625 --> 00:33:46.895
Shit, I'm not able to flank her, am I?

00:33:46.895 --> 00:33:48.967
Is she up against that penis pillar?

00:33:48.967 --> 00:33:50.105
MATT: Yeah.

00:33:50.105 --> 00:33:53.217
Yeah, that pillar is where you would need to be to flank.

00:33:53.217 --> 00:33:54.825
TRAVIS: Brought to you by Bad Dragon.

00:33:54.825 --> 00:33:58.535
MARISHA: Well, let me at least, I
guess, come one more five feet

00:33:58.535 --> 00:34:00.500
towards the pillar.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.635
MATT: There?
MARISHA: Ye.

00:34:01.635 --> 00:34:02.468
MATT: All righty.

00:34:02.468 --> 00:34:03.941
MARISHA: She's still good, yeah?

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:04.774
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:34:04.774 --> 00:34:05.718
MARISHA: Or I'm still in range?

00:34:06.859 --> 00:34:10.526
A-pop pop, I'm going to do a big old swing with my staff.

00:34:10.526 --> 00:34:12.355
MATT: Do it.
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

00:34:12.355 --> 00:34:13.188
TRAVIS: No!

00:34:13.188 --> 00:34:14.278
MARISHA: That sucks.

00:34:14.278 --> 00:34:15.695
Next swing.

00:34:15.695 --> 00:34:16.708
That's much better.

00:34:17.939 --> 00:34:20.590
That is a 14 total, so for 26

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.635
to hit?
MATT: That does hit.

00:34:22.635 --> 00:34:24.293
MARISHA: Cool, Stunning Strike.

00:34:24.293 --> 00:34:25.305
MATT: All righty.

00:34:25.305 --> 00:34:28.355
MARISHA: Oh my god, I rolled a one on the damage die, too!

00:34:28.355 --> 00:34:29.828
MATT: 19 on the save.

00:34:31.253 --> 00:34:32.585
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh, damn.

00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:34.057
MARISHA: 19 on the save, huh?

00:34:34.057 --> 00:34:36.405
MATT: What's the damage on that?

00:34:36.405 --> 00:34:37.375
MARISHA: Eight damage.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:39.015
MATT: Eight damage, all righty.

00:34:39.015 --> 00:34:40.904
MARISHA: Hmm, Flurry Of Blows.

00:34:40.904 --> 00:34:41.737
MATT: Okay.

00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:48.335
MARISHA: Those both hit. Those are both over 14

00:34:48.335 --> 00:34:52.385
so 26 and 30 total.

00:34:52.385 --> 00:34:53.645
MATT: Yeah, those hit.

00:34:57.385 --> 00:34:58.695
MARISHA: Oh shit, shit, where's another die?

00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:00.158
Here we go, hah, hah!

00:35:01.835 --> 00:35:03.445
Okay.

00:35:03.445 --> 00:35:06.348
Okay, that is 13 damage.

00:35:07.311 --> 00:35:08.144
MATT: 13.

00:35:08.144 --> 00:35:09.845
MARISHA: And that was--

00:35:11.035 --> 00:35:12.555
Oh wait, did I roll two die?

00:35:12.555 --> 00:35:14.095
MATT: You did.

00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:16.305
MARISHA: Okay, then that was another
stupid one on the damage die

00:35:16.305 --> 00:35:17.605
so eight damage.

00:35:17.605 --> 00:35:18.438
MATT: Eight damage, got it.

00:35:18.438 --> 00:35:20.435
MARISHA: Extract Aspects.

00:35:20.435 --> 00:35:22.885
MATT: Cree is resistant to psychic damage.

00:35:22.885 --> 00:35:27.215
MARISHA: Resistant to psychic, that's good to know.

00:35:27.215 --> 00:35:28.925
And then, I'm almost done.

00:35:28.925 --> 00:35:30.675
I'm going to spend one more ki point

00:35:32.035 --> 00:35:34.098
to Extort Truth.

00:35:35.255 --> 00:35:36.530
MATT: Okay.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.625
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MATT: All righty.

00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:39.545
What's the save on that one?

00:35:39.545 --> 00:35:41.375
MARISHA: She has to make a charisma saving throw.

00:35:41.375 --> 00:35:42.285
SAM: Ooh.
MATT: Charisma.

00:35:42.285 --> 00:35:44.115
LIAM: Hit those pressure points.

00:35:44.115 --> 00:35:45.505
MATT: That is going to be a 16.

00:35:45.505 --> 00:35:47.435
MARISHA: She fails, she had to make a 17.

00:35:47.435 --> 00:35:50.275
MATT: Okay, then yes.
MARISHA: So for one minute

00:35:50.275 --> 00:35:54.602
Cree cannot deliberately tell a lie.

00:35:54.602 --> 00:35:55.435
And...

00:35:59.075 --> 00:36:00.945
Sorry, sorry.

00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:03.575
All charisma checks made against her

00:36:03.575 --> 00:36:06.668
are made with advantage for up to 10 minutes.

00:36:07.645 --> 00:36:09.385
SAM: She doesn't have to tell the truth,

00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:11.215
but she can't lie.

00:36:11.215 --> 00:36:13.135
TRAVIS: We'll ask her questions in between popping her

00:36:13.135 --> 00:36:14.915
in the face. (laughs)

00:36:14.915 --> 00:36:17.625
MARISHA: If they come up, I guess, I don't know.

00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:19.096
SAM: What's your ATM pin?

00:36:19.096 --> 00:36:22.005
(laughter)

00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:22.995
MARISHA: Okay, that's my--

00:36:22.995 --> 00:36:25.475
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: What's your mother's maiden name?

00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:26.865
MATT: That finishes your go, Beauregard.

00:36:26.865 --> 00:36:28.635
Caduceus, you're up.

00:36:28.635 --> 00:36:31.135
Cree rolled super-low initiative. (laughs)

00:36:31.135 --> 00:36:32.143
TALIESIN: I'm going to try--

00:36:32.143 --> 00:36:33.348
MATT: I was like: Three. Shit.

00:36:35.085 --> 00:36:40.085
TALIESIN: How far away from her am I at the moment?

00:36:40.105 --> 00:36:41.595
MATT: From Cree, you're about 60 feet away.

00:36:41.595 --> 00:36:43.675
TALIESIN: 60 fucking feet, okay.

00:36:43.675 --> 00:36:44.918
TRAVIS: 60 fucking feet.

00:36:44.918 --> 00:36:46.288
TALIESIN: 60 fucking feet.

00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:50.555
That's too much, I'm holding that off.

00:36:50.555 --> 00:36:51.588
If I can get--

00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:55.705
I'm going to try and get 30 feet away,

00:36:55.705 --> 00:36:56.645
if that's possible.

00:36:56.645 --> 00:36:57.478
MATT: Sure.

00:36:58.765 --> 00:36:59.745
TALIESIN: Is it possible to do that

00:36:59.745 --> 00:37:02.365
without getting too close to the flesh?

00:37:02.365 --> 00:37:04.155
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: No?

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.375
Okay, then 30 feet.

00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:07.855
I want to get within 30 feet so I can cast a spell.

00:37:07.855 --> 00:37:08.971
MATT: Okay. Make a

00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:10.142
dexterity saving throw for me, if you don't mind.

00:37:10.142 --> 00:37:11.648
TALIESIN: All right, fuck it.

00:37:14.555 --> 00:37:15.918
That's 12.

00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:20.055
MATT: (whooshing) You are pulled in

00:37:20.055 --> 00:37:22.485
by the same tethers that now hold Fjord

00:37:22.485 --> 00:37:24.857
around the calves and ankles.
TRAVIS: Hey, Caduceus.

00:37:24.857 --> 00:37:25.935
TALIESIN: Hey.

00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:27.447
MATT: Your speed is zero,

00:37:27.447 --> 00:37:28.589
but you still have your action

00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:29.525
in the process.
TALIESIN: But nothing's--

00:37:29.525 --> 00:37:32.625
I'm going to hold my action,

00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:33.978
which is going to be--

00:37:35.785 --> 00:37:38.975
I'm going to be using one of my Channel Divinities

00:37:38.975 --> 00:37:41.015
to Path to the Grave.

00:37:41.015 --> 00:37:42.275
But I'm going to wait

00:37:42.275 --> 00:37:44.605
until after Jester's turn.

00:37:44.605 --> 00:37:45.628
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:37:47.215 --> 00:37:48.485
All right.

00:37:48.485 --> 00:37:51.105
That finishes your go, Caduceus?

00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:52.665
TALIESIN: For now, yeah.

00:37:52.665 --> 00:37:54.269
MATT: Okay.

00:37:54.269 --> 00:37:55.102
Cree's turn.

00:37:55.102 --> 00:37:56.875
SAM: Finally!
MATT: I know.

00:37:56.875 --> 00:37:59.665
Cree is like (grunting)

00:37:59.665 --> 00:38:02.535
"You're too late, I think."

00:38:02.535 --> 00:38:04.710
Looks back over the shoulder,

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.878
counting and noticing the two that vanished.

00:38:10.469 --> 00:38:12.725
Yasha, you do get an attack opportunity

00:38:12.725 --> 00:38:13.745
as Cree is going to go ahead

00:38:13.745 --> 00:38:14.945
and attempt to step away.

00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:15.928
ASHLEY: I shall take it.

00:38:17.145 --> 00:38:19.052
MARISHA: Sentinel bitch.

00:38:19.052 --> 00:38:20.898
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:22.775
That would be 26 to hit.

00:38:22.775 --> 00:38:23.608
MATT: That hits.

00:38:23.608 --> 00:38:25.395
Go ahead and roll damage.

00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:27.045
TRAVIS: Come here!

00:38:27.045 --> 00:38:29.868
ASHLEY: Get over here! (whooshing)

00:38:31.535 --> 00:38:32.368
Okay.
SAM: That is the tiniest

00:38:32.368 --> 00:38:33.997
stupid little dice.
ASHLEY: I know it's the

00:38:33.997 --> 00:38:35.135
teeniest.
LAURA: Like pew!

00:38:35.135 --> 00:38:36.575
SAM: It's so tiny!

00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:38.045
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:38:38.045 --> 00:38:40.415
So that would be

00:38:42.035 --> 00:38:43.025
20 total.

00:38:43.025 --> 00:38:43.858
MATT: 20 total.
SAM: Dude.

00:38:43.858 --> 00:38:44.925
TALIESIN: Wow.
SAM: Dude!

00:38:44.925 --> 00:38:46.385
TALIESIN: This is vicious.

00:38:46.385 --> 00:38:47.920
MATT: Cree is looking hurt.

00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:51.562
Cree, after-- gets hit by you,

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:52.395
gets knocked to one knee

00:38:52.395 --> 00:38:54.345
and sees that running is not an option.

00:38:55.795 --> 00:38:57.718
Looks up between Beauregard and you.

00:38:59.183 --> 00:39:02.625
(snarling) Takes the red cloak and wraps it around herself

00:39:02.625 --> 00:39:03.458
to go ahead

00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:04.925
and Dimension Door.
TRAVIS: Stay, Counterspell.

00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:05.758
MATT: Okay.

00:39:05.758 --> 00:39:07.425
Since it is a 4th-level spell,

00:39:07.425 --> 00:39:09.085
go ahead and roll to see if you Counterspell.

00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:12.635
So roll d20 and add your charisma modifier of five.

00:39:12.635 --> 00:39:13.468
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:39:13.468 --> 00:39:15.035
MATT: You need to roll a nine or higher.

00:39:15.035 --> 00:39:16.175
TRAVIS: Casting it at--
ASHLEY: Come on.

00:39:16.175 --> 00:39:17.008
LAURA: Nine or higher.

00:39:17.008 --> 00:39:17.841
TRAVIS: I'm casting it--
MARISHA: Hang on, wait.

00:39:17.841 --> 00:39:19.077
Did you say--
TRAVIS: -- at 5th-level.

00:39:19.077 --> 00:39:20.055
Casting at 5th-level.
MARISHA: -- charisma?

00:39:20.055 --> 00:39:21.468
SAM: Yeah, but it's not a charisma save.

00:39:21.468 --> 00:39:23.508
MATT: Oh yeah, you're casting it at 5th-level?

00:39:23.508 --> 00:39:25.435
Well then, then it's gone.

00:39:25.435 --> 00:39:26.426
That's right.
MATT: You don't have to roll.

00:39:26.426 --> 00:39:27.934
LAURA: Warlocks just automatically cast high.
MATT: That's right.

00:39:27.934 --> 00:39:29.535
SAM: It's done, it's done.

00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:30.368
TRAVIS: Bing!

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.293
MARISHA: Done, done.

00:39:32.675 --> 00:39:37.675
MATT: With that, the cloak wraps around, and Cree (exhaling)

00:39:38.095 --> 00:39:42.095
exhales as you see this flash of arcane energy

00:39:42.095 --> 00:39:44.948
come off of this cape and then dissipate like mist.

00:39:46.315 --> 00:39:49.685
Behind, you see Fjord, arm out and having the arcane tethers

00:39:49.685 --> 00:39:51.675
unraveling it as they return to you

00:39:51.675 --> 00:39:52.995
and then drift away.

00:39:52.995 --> 00:39:54.395
TRAVIS: Well, we want you to stay.

00:39:55.778 --> 00:39:56.828
SAM: Oh boy.

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:59.720
MATT: Cree is facing away from you now.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.955
Cree is just facing the other room,

00:40:00.955 --> 00:40:02.371
doesn't even look back at any of you.

00:40:02.371 --> 00:40:03.204
The only one who can see

00:40:03.204 --> 00:40:04.992
her face right now is Beauregard.

00:40:04.992 --> 00:40:07.025
And Cree is looking forward,

00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:08.438
hollow and furious.

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:14.183
She's going to spend the rest of her turn going

00:40:14.183 --> 00:40:16.424
(panting)

00:40:16.424 --> 00:40:17.645
and just breathe heavily.

00:40:18.925 --> 00:40:20.778
Beauregard and Caleb.

00:40:21.615 --> 00:40:23.895
You hear Cree's voice

00:40:23.895 --> 00:40:25.685
not speaking to you,

00:40:25.685 --> 00:40:28.378
but you pick up on it like a wayward radio signal.

00:40:29.705 --> 00:40:33.208
It says "Nonagon, help me!

00:40:34.385 --> 00:40:35.218
"Please!"

00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:37.458
That's all you hear.

00:40:37.458 --> 00:40:40.045
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, oh!
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no.

00:40:40.045 --> 00:40:43.625
LIAM: Caleb just says: We need to
pick up the pace right now!

00:40:43.625 --> 00:40:45.990
MATT: All right, finishing-- that's Cree's turn.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.823
(laughter)

00:40:46.823 --> 00:40:47.878
TRAVIS: Don't pull 'em out!

00:40:48.798 --> 00:40:50.225
TALIESIN: This is about to go very poorly in about--

00:40:50.225 --> 00:40:51.205
LAURA: Jester, you're up.

00:40:51.205 --> 00:40:53.841
LAURA: (screaming) Okay, okay, okay.

00:40:53.841 --> 00:40:54.674
TRAVIS: (screams)
LAURA: I look up.

00:40:54.674 --> 00:40:57.905
So the gem is dangling how far now down

00:40:57.905 --> 00:40:58.975
off the ground or ceiling?

00:40:58.975 --> 00:41:01.065
MATT: It's about 15 feet above you, 15 to 20 feet,

00:41:01.065 --> 00:41:04.826
and it's dangling by some tethers, rocking.

00:41:04.826 --> 00:41:08.235
And more and more little tendrils (squishing)

00:41:08.235 --> 00:41:09.723
wrapping around from different angles.

00:41:09.723 --> 00:41:11.265
Like a sea anemone mouth opening and

00:41:11.265 --> 00:41:13.305
trying to pull something.
LAURA: Trying to pull it back up?

00:41:13.305 --> 00:41:16.215
How tall, having seen Caleb do this many times,

00:41:16.215 --> 00:41:19.955
how tall are giant apes?

00:41:19.955 --> 00:41:22.535
MATT: Giant apes are considered-- they're about 15 feet.

00:41:22.535 --> 00:41:23.505
LIAM: They're huge.

00:41:23.505 --> 00:41:24.841
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: I'm going to polymorph

00:41:24.841 --> 00:41:28.032
myself into a giant ape.

00:41:28.032 --> 00:41:30.802
Jester-pleb? No, that's not right.

00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:33.022
Jestape, I'm not sure.

00:41:33.022 --> 00:41:33.935
MARISHA: Jestape?

00:41:33.935 --> 00:41:35.788
LAURA: Giant blue ape!
SAM: Japester.

00:41:35.788 --> 00:41:37.405
LAURA: And I'm going to reach up

00:41:37.405 --> 00:41:39.285
and grab it and pull it down

00:41:39.285 --> 00:41:40.585
with all my strength that I have

00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:42.652
and try to yank it out of its socket.

00:41:42.652 --> 00:41:43.485
MATT: Okay.

00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:44.558
LAURA: Fight against those tethers.

00:41:44.558 --> 00:41:46.655
MATT: All righty. Go ahead and roll a strength check

00:41:46.655 --> 00:41:48.995
using the giant ape's strength modifier.

00:41:48.995 --> 00:41:51.943
This is you versus Cognouza.

00:41:51.943 --> 00:41:54.447
LAURA: Yeah, but it's just a tendril of Cognouza

00:41:54.447 --> 00:41:55.735
MATT: So go ahead and roll.

00:41:55.735 --> 00:41:56.568
See how it goes.

00:41:56.568 --> 00:41:59.145
TRAVIS: Do we have to do any d20 weirdness on casting spells

00:41:59.145 --> 00:41:59.978
anymore?
LIAM: Not anymore.

00:41:59.978 --> 00:42:00.969
TRAVIS: Just Aeor.
LAURA: Just Aeor.

00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:02.765
MATT: Just seem to be Aeor.
LIAM: Or Eiselcross.

00:42:02.765 --> 00:42:03.648
LAURA: 14.

00:42:04.905 --> 00:42:06.425
MATT: Not enough.

00:42:06.425 --> 00:42:08.775
As you reach up and grab it,

00:42:08.775 --> 00:42:10.875
you're still holding on to it and dangling,

00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:12.475
and some tethers pull taut

00:42:12.475 --> 00:42:16.218
and you see one larger, thick tentacle

00:42:16.218 --> 00:42:17.845
(squelching) and grab it.

00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:20.715
And it's now your weight versus the stone

00:42:20.715 --> 00:42:21.955
and these tendrils,

00:42:21.955 --> 00:42:25.110
and it continues to lift up as you lose your grip.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.326
LAURA: Wait! Oh, I lose my grip?

00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:29.320
Can I still keep a hold on it, at least?

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.245
MATT: Not with a 14.

00:42:31.245 --> 00:42:32.895
But it's not beyond your reach, still.

00:42:32.895 --> 00:42:35.578
You can try again next round if things go well.

00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:40.335
Unfortunately, it is a smooth stone.

00:42:40.335 --> 00:42:41.393
TRAVIS: Who has the stronger

00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:42.815
strength mod, you or the ape?

00:42:42.815 --> 00:42:44.355
LAURA: The ape.

00:42:44.355 --> 00:42:46.095
MATT: It was just a not good roll, unfortunately.

00:42:46.095 --> 00:42:47.345
LAURA: Yeah, that was a shit roll.

00:42:47.345 --> 00:42:48.178
MATT: But good call. All right,

00:42:48.178 --> 00:42:50.125
finishing Jester's go, then.

00:42:50.125 --> 00:42:51.135
Are you going to stay put or are you going to move

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:52.155
elsewhere in the chamber?

00:42:52.155 --> 00:42:53.661
LAURA: No, I'm going to try-- I'm right below it,

00:42:53.661 --> 00:42:54.705
I want to try to be right below it.

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:55.538
MATT: You got it.

00:42:55.538 --> 00:42:56.371
All right.

00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:57.475
Veth, your turn.

00:42:57.475 --> 00:42:59.465
TALIESIN: I snap my fingers.

00:42:59.465 --> 00:43:00.298
SAM: What's that do?

00:43:00.298 --> 00:43:03.622
TALIESIN: You'll see. There's a little shimmer on Cree, so.

00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:04.458
SAM: Oh my god!

00:43:04.458 --> 00:43:05.870
TRAVIS: "You'll see"?

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.482
SAM: She's turned Caduceus!

00:43:07.482 --> 00:43:08.670
(laughter)

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.252
SAM: Into a jazz man!

00:43:10.252 --> 00:43:12.602
(laughter)

00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:14.045
TRAVIS: (scatting)

00:43:14.045 --> 00:43:16.195
SAM: Are we trying to kill her still?

00:43:16.195 --> 00:43:18.285
MARISHA: Yeah, just-- probably.

00:43:18.285 --> 00:43:19.118
SAM: I feel bad.

00:43:19.118 --> 00:43:20.125
TRAVIS: What is this, emotion?!

00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:22.275
SAM: Well, I don't know.
TRAVIS: End her!

00:43:22.275 --> 00:43:23.715
SAM: We can get information

00:43:23.715 --> 00:43:24.548
from her.
MARISHA: I mean, I guess

00:43:24.548 --> 00:43:26.052
if you want to be like,

00:43:26.052 --> 00:43:29.145
"Who does Lucien work for?" as you punch her, if you can.

00:43:29.145 --> 00:43:31.115
TALIESIN: We can do that when she's dead, too.

00:43:31.115 --> 00:43:32.555
SAM: Okay.

00:43:32.555 --> 00:43:33.475
MARISHA: Oh.

00:43:33.475 --> 00:43:34.308
LAURA: Kill her!

00:43:34.308 --> 00:43:35.141
SAM: Yeah?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:35.141 --> 00:43:36.665
TALIESIN: Do it.

00:43:36.665 --> 00:43:37.835
SAM: This is life or death!

00:43:37.835 --> 00:43:38.775
TRAVIS: Or do what you want to do.

00:43:38.775 --> 00:43:40.075
SAM: Okay.

00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:41.034
I'll kill her.

00:43:41.034 --> 00:43:43.255
(laughter)

00:43:43.255 --> 00:43:44.615
SAM: She's engaged with my friends

00:43:44.615 --> 00:43:47.533
so I can just attack and still get sneak attack damage?

00:43:47.533 --> 00:43:48.366
MATT: Yeah.

00:43:48.366 --> 00:43:49.215
SAM: If I hit?
MATT: If you hit.

00:43:49.215 --> 00:43:50.245
SAM: I will just hit.

00:43:50.245 --> 00:43:51.385
I mean, I will hope I hit.

00:43:51.385 --> 00:43:52.715
Oh no!

00:43:52.715 --> 00:43:53.595
15!

00:43:53.595 --> 00:43:55.665
TRAVIS: Oh no!
MATT: 15 misses.

00:43:55.665 --> 00:43:57.658
SAM: Bonus action fire again.

00:43:58.815 --> 00:44:00.199
Terrible!

00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:01.261
17!

00:44:01.261 --> 00:44:02.094
ASHLEY: Oh no!
MARISHA: No!

00:44:02.094 --> 00:44:03.182
MATT: 17 misses.

00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:04.815
TALIESIN: Damn it.

00:44:04.815 --> 00:44:06.880
TRAVIS: Your morals are conflicted!

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.235
SAM: Oh no!

00:44:08.235 --> 00:44:10.675
MATT: The process of the moral quandary!

00:44:10.675 --> 00:44:12.346
SAM: Maybe a little intentional.

00:44:12.346 --> 00:44:15.682
(laughter)

00:44:15.682 --> 00:44:16.590
TALIESIN: Would have been dope.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:17.423
Oh well.

00:44:18.798 --> 00:44:19.631
MATT: All right, well.
SAM: She just seems like

00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:21.665
a nice kitty cat.

00:44:21.665 --> 00:44:23.575
MATT: Finishing your go, that brings us to Yasha.

00:44:23.575 --> 00:44:25.025
You're up with Caleb on deck.

00:44:26.555 --> 00:44:27.865
ASHLEY: Yes?

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.255
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:29.255 --> 00:44:30.095
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:44:30.095 --> 00:44:32.064
TRAVIS: Where'd the question mark come from?

00:44:32.064 --> 00:44:33.967
ASHLEY: I don't know, okay?
TRAVIS: Don't let the question mark

00:44:33.967 --> 00:44:34.925
invade you.

00:44:34.925 --> 00:44:36.577
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to take a swing.

00:44:36.577 --> 00:44:37.947
MATT: Okay!
SAM: Maybe she's turned over

00:44:37.947 --> 00:44:39.905
a new leaf, Yasha!

00:44:39.905 --> 00:44:41.605
ASHLEY: Oh don't-- Okay, okay, that

00:44:41.605 --> 00:44:42.692
definitely didn't hit.

00:44:42.692 --> 00:44:43.909
Because that was a two.

00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:44.875
LAURA: Why are you excited

00:44:44.875 --> 00:44:45.819
about not hitting her?
TALIESIN: We're going to die.

00:44:45.819 --> 00:44:46.752
We're going to die.

00:44:46.752 --> 00:44:48.418
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
LAURA: She's calling Lucien!

00:44:48.418 --> 00:44:49.655
ASHLEY: Second hit, second hit.

00:44:50.705 --> 00:44:51.538
SAM: She has a family!

00:44:51.538 --> 00:44:54.105
ASHLEY: God dang it!
LIAM: For all we know,

00:44:54.105 --> 00:44:55.683
Beau and Caleb are about to get turned on.

00:44:55.683 --> 00:44:56.641
MARISHA: Are you serious?
TRAVIS: She runs a non profit!

00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:57.607
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm serious.

00:44:57.607 --> 00:44:58.440
MARISHA: No!

00:45:00.624 --> 00:45:01.624
ASHLEY: That's 18.

00:45:02.464 --> 00:45:04.175
MATT: 18 just misses.

00:45:04.175 --> 00:45:05.469
SAM: She donates most of her--
ASHLEY: No!

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:07.905
SAM: -- her profits to charity.

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:09.305
ASHLEY: 19.

00:45:09.305 --> 00:45:10.171
MATT: 19 just hits.

00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:11.955
ASHLEY: Ooh!
MARISHA: Yes!

00:45:11.955 --> 00:45:12.815
ASHLEY: Rolled a seven.

00:45:12.815 --> 00:45:14.519
Plus 12, I did it wrong.
MARISHA: Dump everything.

00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:16.085
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: That is 19, yeah.

00:45:16.085 --> 00:45:17.741
ASHLEY: Yes, that's 19.

00:45:17.741 --> 00:45:19.136
(exhaling)

00:45:19.136 --> 00:45:20.034
TRAVIS: Oh, come on!

00:45:20.034 --> 00:45:21.037
(laughter)

00:45:21.037 --> 00:45:22.825
MATT: Holy shit!

00:45:22.825 --> 00:45:24.174
ASHLEY: Ooh.
MATT: What is it?

00:45:24.174 --> 00:45:26.464
ASHLEY: I rolled all sixes.

00:45:26.464 --> 00:45:28.368
SAM: 666.
TALIESIN: It's worse than you think.

00:45:28.368 --> 00:45:30.535
MATT: So all right, so do your damage.

00:45:30.535 --> 00:45:31.368
All sixes.

00:45:31.368 --> 00:45:32.825
LAURA: I wanted to be holding onto it, just be dangling on.

00:45:32.825 --> 00:45:34.296
TALIESIN: This is going to be really,

00:45:34.296 --> 00:45:35.535
really dark.
TRAVIS: Because of your shimmer?

00:45:35.535 --> 00:45:36.368
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:45:37.825 --> 00:45:40.108
ASHLEY: Okay wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:45:41.425 --> 00:45:43.035
TRAVIS: Multiply it by five.
SAM: What is this?

00:45:43.035 --> 00:45:45.207
ASHLEY: I'm pulling out a calculator, shut up.

00:45:45.207 --> 00:45:47.875
TRAVIS: I use a calculator all the time.
SAM: Maybe we should get you one of those TI-85s.

00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:49.249
TALIESIN: Ditto.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:50.374
TRAVIS: Why fuck around with paper math?

00:45:50.374 --> 00:45:51.304
Let's go, guys.

00:45:51.304 --> 00:45:53.175
SAM: Wait, can't your D&amp;D Beyond just do it?

00:45:53.175 --> 00:45:54.008
TRAVIS: Steve Jobs gave us

00:45:54.008 --> 00:45:56.200
a calculator.
ASHLEY: I believe that's 39, is the total.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.814
MATT: 39 points of slashing damage

00:45:57.814 --> 00:46:00.615
which, thanks to Caduceus,

00:46:00.615 --> 00:46:03.844
becomes instead 78--

00:46:03.844 --> 00:46:04.677
ALL: Ooh!

00:46:04.677 --> 00:46:06.505
MATT: -- points of slashing damage.
TALIESIN: Yep, that's what just happened.

00:46:06.505 --> 00:46:08.305
MARISHA: What did you do?
SAM: When did you get that trick?

00:46:08.305 --> 00:46:09.515
TALIESIN: I've had that trick all along.

00:46:09.515 --> 00:46:11.898
MATT: He's used it a number of times, yeah.

00:46:11.898 --> 00:46:13.745
TALIESIN: It's just-- yeah.

00:46:13.745 --> 00:46:14.578
MATT: It's situational.

00:46:14.578 --> 00:46:16.505
TALIESIN: Every now and then, I can double the damage

00:46:16.505 --> 00:46:17.415
on something.
ASHLEY: As she started

00:46:17.415 --> 00:46:19.348
to try to disappear,

00:46:20.395 --> 00:46:21.695
I want to step on her cloak,

00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:23.851
yank her back, and (slicing)

00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:26.245
MATT: So you yank her back and pull her onto your sword?

00:46:26.245 --> 00:46:27.745
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:46:28.735 --> 00:46:30.595
As she goes to try and run and bolt

00:46:30.595 --> 00:46:32.595
you just grab, yank her back and (squishing)

00:46:32.595 --> 00:46:33.933
pull her all over to the hilt.

00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:35.105
(groaning)

00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:38.226
The blade is now sticking fully through Cree's chest.

00:46:38.226 --> 00:46:39.251
LAURA: Yasha!

00:46:39.251 --> 00:46:41.585
MATT: Just coughs this big spatter of blood.

00:46:41.585 --> 00:46:43.485
You can feel the body going limp against the blade

00:46:43.485 --> 00:46:45.436
as she goes, "Lucien."

00:46:46.815 --> 00:46:49.438
You both hear in your mind,

00:46:51.072 --> 00:46:52.305
"You've done well.

00:46:53.175 --> 00:46:55.785
"But I need you to hold them off a little longer.

00:46:55.785 --> 00:46:58.347
"I'm not done. I'm not ready yet.

00:46:58.347 --> 00:47:00.635
"Become a vessel for the pattern

00:47:00.635 --> 00:47:01.785
"and show them the way."

00:47:02.645 --> 00:47:04.025
In the darkness of this chamber

00:47:04.025 --> 00:47:07.255
there's suddenly a dull red glow in your proximity,

00:47:07.255 --> 00:47:10.075
as the five eyes that mark Cree's body

00:47:10.075 --> 00:47:12.349
begin to glow simultaneously.

00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:13.782
SAM: You got three.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.485
MATT: Yasha, as you're holding there,

00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:18.775
you look and you feel Cree's body

00:47:18.775 --> 00:47:20.795
begin to shake,

00:47:20.795 --> 00:47:22.056
just shake violently

00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:23.001
and you have-
ASHLEY: The fuck?

00:47:23.001 --> 00:47:24.588
MATT: Do you want to pull your blade free?

00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:28.005
ASHLEY: I'm going to just, with the bottom of my boot

00:47:28.005 --> 00:47:29.735
push her off my blade.

00:47:29.735 --> 00:47:30.568
MATT: Okay.

00:47:30.568 --> 00:47:32.255
You go ahead and (whooshing)

00:47:32.255 --> 00:47:33.815
shunt the body off of the blade,

00:47:33.815 --> 00:47:34.785
falls to the ground,

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:37.415
and with a limpness that a corpse would

00:47:37.415 --> 00:47:38.385
and the life has been drawn out.

00:47:38.385 --> 00:47:40.335
But when the body impacts,

00:47:40.335 --> 00:47:41.615
there's tension in the muscles

00:47:41.615 --> 00:47:44.845
and you can see now, Cree shaking, convulsing,

00:47:44.845 --> 00:47:46.845
the eyes getting brighter and brighter,

00:47:46.845 --> 00:47:50.385
until suddenly the back of her shoulders split. (cracking)

00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:53.695
Bone and flesh begins to spit out and grow.

00:47:53.695 --> 00:47:56.335
This horrible, mangled version

00:47:56.335 --> 00:48:01.335
of what once was Cree is now this ever-swelling monstrosity

00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:03.905
of flesh, teeth and eyes.
TRAVIS: What?

00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:06.715
MATT: You watch as parts of the ground begin to expand

00:48:06.715 --> 00:48:09.055
and seem to be feeding to the body

00:48:09.055 --> 00:48:10.913
as it gets larger and larger.

00:48:10.913 --> 00:48:13.119
(screeching)

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:13.952
LAURA: Oh!
TRAVIS: Not part of the plan.

00:48:13.952 --> 00:48:16.165
Not part of the plan, not part of the plan.

00:48:16.165 --> 00:48:17.411
LAURA: Oh no.

00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:21.579
(screaming)

00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:23.985
LAURA: It's so shiny!
TRAVIS: Excuse you!

00:48:23.985 --> 00:48:25.176
MATT: Still hexed.

00:48:25.176 --> 00:48:26.585
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:48:26.585 --> 00:48:29.029
MARISHA: And it can't tell a lie.

00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:33.845
(laughter)

00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:38.547
SAM: Oh, nasty.

00:48:39.537 --> 00:48:42.120
TRAVIS: Who does Number Two work for? (snarling)

00:48:43.538 --> 00:48:44.498
Holy shit.

00:48:45.518 --> 00:48:46.395
LAURA: Oh my god.
LIAM: She's wearing a soft

00:48:46.395 --> 00:48:47.685
serve ice cream.
MATT: Give you a nice

00:48:47.685 --> 00:48:48.542
front view of it.
ASHLEY: Ew, it looks so--

00:48:48.542 --> 00:48:49.677
ALL: Ugh!

00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:51.748
TRAVIS: What the fuck, man?
ASHLEY: Get out of here!

00:48:51.748 --> 00:48:52.622
LIAM: Meow.

00:48:52.622 --> 00:48:53.775
LAURA: Oh, poor Cree.

00:48:53.775 --> 00:48:54.865
MARISHA: Is that teeth?

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:55.795
LAURA: Are those bones?
LIAM: Bones.

00:48:55.795 --> 00:48:56.820
MARISHA: Bones?
MATT: Yep.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:57.653
Yeah, that's Cree.

00:48:57.653 --> 00:48:58.928
TRAVIS: Where did you get that?

00:48:58.928 --> 00:49:01.615
MATT: It's a Pathfinder mini and I love it so much.

00:49:01.615 --> 00:49:03.005
I love it.

00:49:03.005 --> 00:49:03.838
Thank you, WizKids,

00:49:03.838 --> 00:49:05.195
you're awesome.
ASHLEY: It looks moist.

00:49:05.195 --> 00:49:06.445
LAURA: Yeah, it does. Ew.

00:49:06.445 --> 00:49:07.548
ASHLEY: Looks a little wet.

00:49:08.774 --> 00:49:10.351
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (retching)

00:49:10.351 --> 00:49:11.417
LIAM: Give it a little spritz.

00:49:12.335 --> 00:49:13.505
MATT: All righty.

00:49:13.505 --> 00:49:16.575
So that finishes Yasha's go?

00:49:16.575 --> 00:49:17.895
Or you have another attack, right?

00:49:17.895 --> 00:49:18.855
MARISHA: Okay.

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.455
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:49:20.455 --> 00:49:21.288
ASHLEY: No, the first missed.

00:49:21.288 --> 00:49:23.382
MATT: That's right, the first one missed, you're right.

00:49:23.382 --> 00:49:25.948
Do you want to stay put? (laughs)

00:49:27.545 --> 00:49:28.685
ASHLEY: I mean, if I move,

00:49:28.685 --> 00:49:30.735
it's going to get an attack of opportunity?

00:49:30.735 --> 00:49:32.051
MATT: Likely.

00:49:32.051 --> 00:49:33.355
LIAM: But who knows what it could do

00:49:33.355 --> 00:49:34.898
with you right there?

00:49:34.898 --> 00:49:35.731
It could envelop you.
ASHLEY: This is true, this is true,

00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:36.975
this is true, this is true!

00:49:36.975 --> 00:49:41.546
Okay, I'm going to try to--

00:49:41.546 --> 00:49:43.285
I'm going to back up.

00:49:43.285 --> 00:49:46.685
Ah, this is so stupid. Maybe I should just stay.

00:49:46.685 --> 00:49:47.558
No, no, no, no.

00:49:47.558 --> 00:49:48.605
SAM: (trumpeting)

00:49:48.605 --> 00:49:50.018
LAURA: ♪ Are you staying? ♪

00:49:50.018 --> 00:49:52.755
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to get out of range, at least

00:49:52.755 --> 00:49:55.785
because my HP is very, very low.

00:49:55.785 --> 00:49:57.451
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

00:49:57.451 --> 00:49:58.555
As you back out of the way,

00:49:58.555 --> 00:49:59.695
it will take a swing.

00:49:59.695 --> 00:50:00.528
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:50:01.945 --> 00:50:05.308
MATT: The claw, that'll be natural 19.

00:50:06.264 --> 00:50:07.663
ASHLEY: That hits.
MATT: Yeah.

00:50:07.663 --> 00:50:08.888
Hits.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:08.888 --> 00:50:10.348
TRAVIS: That's what I do.
MATT: Okay.

00:50:10.348 --> 00:50:11.665
You take--

00:50:14.131 --> 00:50:16.705
LAURA: (groaning)

00:50:16.705 --> 00:50:18.425
MATT: 19 points of slashing damage

00:50:18.425 --> 00:50:22.425
as where once was Cree's arm is now this extended,

00:50:22.425 --> 00:50:24.025
multi-jointed claw

00:50:24.025 --> 00:50:26.625
that as opposed to reaching outward and spinning,

00:50:26.625 --> 00:50:29.410
the fingers actually reconfigure the claws this way

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.133
and swings out wide towards you

00:50:31.133 --> 00:50:33.155
and then catches you in the back and shoulder

00:50:33.155 --> 00:50:34.875
as you stumble forward into the wall.

00:50:34.875 --> 00:50:36.445
And when you hit the wall, you're expecting rock,

00:50:36.445 --> 00:50:37.778
but it gives slightly.

00:50:40.275 --> 00:50:42.583
ASHLEY: Okay, did you say 19 slashing?

00:50:42.583 --> 00:50:44.547
MATT: 19 slashing, you got it.
ASHLEY: So half, because--

00:50:44.547 --> 00:50:46.764
MATT: Yes, it is because you're raging.

00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:50.159
SAM and ASHLEY: (imitate background horn wail)

00:50:50.159 --> 00:50:51.631
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: Boy.

00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:55.069
MATT: That finishes your go, Yasha.

00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:56.209
Caleb, you're up.

00:50:56.209 --> 00:50:57.792
LIAM: Okay, quick quesh.
MATT: Yeah?

00:50:58.859 --> 00:51:02.739
LIAM: Would I be able to climb up my giant blue friend

00:51:02.739 --> 00:51:04.869
and get within touching range of this thing?

00:51:04.869 --> 00:51:09.869
Is it that high up or-- if I were to get to the top of her?

00:51:09.959 --> 00:51:10.849
MATT: If you were to get to the top of her,

00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:12.199
you could probably reach it.
LIAM: Yeah?

00:51:12.199 --> 00:51:14.256
MATT: You'd just have to climb your friend.

00:51:14.256 --> 00:51:16.509
LIAM: Would that be my action?

00:51:16.509 --> 00:51:19.572
MATT: I would say--
LAURA: (grunts)

00:51:19.572 --> 00:51:21.439
SAM: I don't know, look at that look to Laura, Matt.
MATT: Here's the thing.

00:51:21.439 --> 00:51:23.059
SAM: I don't know.

00:51:23.059 --> 00:51:24.529
MATT: She was using her turn to pull it down

00:51:24.529 --> 00:51:25.889
as opposed to helping you up,

00:51:25.889 --> 00:51:28.339
so you have to actually physically climb it.

00:51:28.339 --> 00:51:31.479
I will say, if you don't want to use your action to do it,

00:51:31.479 --> 00:51:32.312
it's going to take a check with

00:51:32.312 --> 00:51:34.149
disadvantage because you're kind of winging it.

00:51:35.209 --> 00:51:36.669
TRAVIS: Come on, dirt wizard.

00:51:36.669 --> 00:51:37.527
MATT: But it's possible.

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:39.477
TRAVIS: Advantage, disadvantage climb.

00:51:40.561 --> 00:51:41.769
ASHLEY: Get it.
MATT: Who knows?

00:51:41.769 --> 00:51:43.223
You may--
LIAM: No.

00:51:43.223 --> 00:51:44.765
MATT: -- Legolas this.
LIAM: No.

00:51:44.765 --> 00:51:48.206
No, I want to so bad, but instead,

00:51:48.206 --> 00:51:50.839
I share an earnest look with my giant blue friend

00:51:50.839 --> 00:51:52.769
and I laugh a little bit

00:51:52.769 --> 00:51:54.819
and I pull the cat mint out of my pocket,

00:51:54.819 --> 00:51:56.821
crush it and I send Cat's Ire,

00:51:56.821 --> 00:51:58.813
Frumpkin appears for a second.

00:51:58.813 --> 00:52:03.029
Gone, giant claw grabs the gem and pulls again.

00:52:03.029 --> 00:52:03.919
So I'm going to try to yank it out.

00:52:03.919 --> 00:52:05.079
MATT: So go ahead and make a strength check

00:52:05.079 --> 00:52:07.322
with the modifier of your spell.

00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:10.609
LIAM: Balls!

00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:11.442
MATT: What'd you get?

00:52:11.442 --> 00:52:13.357
LIAM: Two, so that's a 10 total.

00:52:13.357 --> 00:52:15.379
MATT: 10's not enough.
LIAM: Gosh dang it.

00:52:15.379 --> 00:52:17.955
MATT: 10's not enough.
MARISHA: Fighting this thing.

00:52:17.955 --> 00:52:19.539
TRAVIS: Man.
MATT: Ah, these rolls.

00:52:19.539 --> 00:52:20.372
LAURA: Yeah.

00:52:20.372 --> 00:52:22.339
MATT: As the claw grabs it, you see it pulling.

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:23.319
LAURA: You should've tried to climb!

00:52:23.319 --> 00:52:26.754
MATT: The central tether is very strong and you see--
LIAM: It would've been a two!

00:52:26.754 --> 00:52:28.362
MATT: -- it's being pulled back up into it

00:52:28.362 --> 00:52:32.562
and what's disturbing is the
stone circle that's built for its space

00:52:32.562 --> 00:52:35.829
seems to be reaching almost in a faint pucker towards it,

00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:38.669
like it's wanting to accept the stone

00:52:38.669 --> 00:52:40.189
back into its vacuous space.

00:52:40.189 --> 00:52:42.139
LIAM: It's like Audrey II going (lip smacks).

00:52:42.139 --> 00:52:44.442
MATT: Yeah, it wants the stone back

00:52:44.442 --> 00:52:47.459
and all these little tendrils are pulling and pulling,

00:52:47.459 --> 00:52:50.092
as you're both trying desperately to get it down.

00:52:51.519 --> 00:52:52.819
All right.
LIAM: Great, next.

00:52:53.668 --> 00:52:54.989
LAURA: (groans)

00:52:54.989 --> 00:52:57.039
MATT: Finishing Caleb's go. Fjord, you're up.

00:52:58.824 --> 00:53:01.786
TRAVIS: Right, I will use my bonus action.

00:53:01.786 --> 00:53:03.586
MATT: At the start of your turn.
TRAVIS: Yep?

00:53:04.969 --> 00:53:08.878
MATT: It's interesting. The fleshy body
of whatever Cree has become, is--

00:53:09.953 --> 00:53:11.999
It's hard to make out what the structure is

00:53:11.999 --> 00:53:15.749
beyond hints of what was once somewhat humanoid.

00:53:15.749 --> 00:53:17.039
But there's something else beyond it.

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:19.239
At certain moments, there's a blur or a flicker,

00:53:19.239 --> 00:53:21.066
something (whooshing).

00:53:21.066 --> 00:53:24.359
Elements that seem to fuzz and you swear for a second,

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:27.799
you see symbols or text or something,

00:53:27.799 --> 00:53:30.429
something is built into the body.

00:53:30.429 --> 00:53:33.229
The flesh itself is evoking something

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:37.439
fractal in moments.

00:53:37.439 --> 00:53:40.280
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.929
TRAVIS: Fractal in moments.

00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:43.822
TALIESIN: Fuck my life.

00:53:46.192 --> 00:53:48.765
TRAVIS: (groans)

00:53:48.765 --> 00:53:49.598
13.

00:53:49.598 --> 00:53:51.844
MATT: 13, all right, continue with your turn.

00:53:51.844 --> 00:53:53.429
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:53:53.429 --> 00:53:54.359
With my bonus action,

00:53:54.359 --> 00:53:57.899
I'll use Relentless Hex to magically teleport

00:53:57.899 --> 00:54:02.399
up to 30 feet on the other side of the ze goo.

00:54:02.399 --> 00:54:04.579
MATT: There you go, you are right there.

00:54:04.579 --> 00:54:07.349
TRAVIS: In melee, but out of my bonds.

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:09.089
MATT: Indeed, you have now made

00:54:09.089 --> 00:54:12.740
your way out of the strange skin puddle.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.078
TRAVIS: (retches)

00:54:14.078 --> 00:54:16.469
I will take three swipes

00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:20.219
with the Star Razor against the lower intestine.

00:54:20.219 --> 00:54:21.269
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:25.806
All right, show me what you got.

00:54:27.286 --> 00:54:28.662
19.
MATT: That hits.

00:54:30.329 --> 00:54:32.809
TRAVIS: Natural 20!
MATT: Nice!

00:54:34.029 --> 00:54:36.909
TRAVIS: No, it's only two. It's only two, two swipes.

00:54:36.909 --> 00:54:40.204
So the first one is 1d10,

00:54:40.204 --> 00:54:41.962
I'm going to fucking pump it in.

00:54:43.379 --> 00:54:45.479
That's a 10 plus eight.

00:54:45.479 --> 00:54:46.559
18 plus that.

00:54:50.129 --> 00:54:51.429
22 points of

00:54:52.679 --> 00:54:54.469
slashing

00:54:54.469 --> 00:54:56.169
damage.
MATT: Awesome.

00:54:56.169 --> 00:54:57.529
TRAVIS: And then the second one,

00:54:57.529 --> 00:55:00.829
I'm going to pump a Divine Smite into it.

00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:01.662
MATT: Hell yeah.

00:55:02.975 --> 00:55:06.300
TRAVIS: Which is down here, so 1d10 plus eight.

00:55:08.217 --> 00:55:11.633
Okay, I got it, okay, okay (tongue waggling).

00:55:11.633 --> 00:55:14.183
13 plus three is 16.

00:55:15.244 --> 00:55:19.832
Okay, 16 and then double 16 is 32.

00:55:19.832 --> 00:55:21.698
32, Savage Attack.

00:55:21.698 --> 00:55:26.159
I roll an extra damage die for eight.

00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:26.992
So that's

00:55:28.389 --> 00:55:29.249
40.

00:55:29.249 --> 00:55:30.109
SAM: Dude.

00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:32.582
TRAVIS: 40 and then Divine Smite.

00:55:34.359 --> 00:55:35.532
♪ Help me, lord. ♪

00:55:38.019 --> 00:55:41.709
I think it's only 4d6 because it's not undead, right?

00:55:41.709 --> 00:55:43.399
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:55:43.399 --> 00:55:44.959
SAM: It's just gross.

00:55:44.959 --> 00:55:46.929
TRAVIS: It just nasty.

00:55:46.929 --> 00:55:50.164
Okay, so I think it's 4d6, I have to find it.

00:55:58.101 --> 00:55:58.934
Nine.

00:56:00.814 --> 00:56:02.289
13, is that right?

00:56:04.639 --> 00:56:06.389
SAM: A lot of math here tonight, guys.

00:56:07.726 --> 00:56:10.256
TRAVIS: Where is Divine Smite in this damn thing?

00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:14.329
Players, take your time when it's your turn.

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:16.551
Who cares if there's an audience watching?

00:56:16.551 --> 00:56:18.439
(laughter)

00:56:18.439 --> 00:56:19.814
4d8.

00:56:21.699 --> 00:56:24.459
Those are d6s, that's dumb, it'd 4d8.

00:56:24.459 --> 00:56:26.119
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: See?

00:56:26.119 --> 00:56:27.892
I've done this before.
TALIESIN: Yay.

00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:30.489
TRAVIS: Eight.

00:56:30.489 --> 00:56:31.322
12.

00:56:32.779 --> 00:56:33.612
16.

00:56:35.199 --> 00:56:36.789
20.

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:40.199
So 20 points, is that also doubled because it's a crit?

00:56:40.199 --> 00:56:42.059
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: So 40 points.

00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:43.259
MATT: So a total of 80 points?

00:56:43.259 --> 00:56:44.286
TRAVIS: 80 points.

00:56:44.286 --> 00:56:46.828
ASHLEY: Holy moly!
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

00:56:47.884 --> 00:56:49.714
MATT: That's rough.

00:56:51.099 --> 00:56:53.919
As you strike with the blade each time,

00:56:53.919 --> 00:56:56.189
the shock of pain causes elements

00:56:56.189 --> 00:56:58.699
of the bones to stick out like spines

00:56:58.699 --> 00:57:00.459
reflexively in your direction,

00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:02.619
piercing you and you go for the second strike,

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.609
the heavy crit strike and it cuts through

00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:06.869
and where the gashes left behind open

00:57:06.869 --> 00:57:09.609
and you see like the face of Cree go (screech)

00:57:09.609 --> 00:57:12.829
inside the wound as more spines shink out

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:15.509
and pierce you like spears, suddenly they retract

00:57:15.509 --> 00:57:18.289
and become part of the roiling body after that point.

00:57:18.289 --> 00:57:21.107
You take 22 points of piercing damage.

00:57:21.107 --> 00:57:24.819
TRAVIS: Whoa, 22 points of piercing for hitting it?

00:57:24.819 --> 00:57:25.652
MATT: Yep.

00:57:25.652 --> 00:57:27.629
TRAVIS: That doesn't count as a melee attack, right?

00:57:27.629 --> 00:57:29.919
MATT: No, it's reflexively from taking melee hits.

00:57:29.919 --> 00:57:32.940
TRAVIS: Very cool and also shit.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.720
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.351
Get out!

00:57:36.351 --> 00:57:38.529
I'm pulling ribs out of mine.

00:57:38.529 --> 00:57:39.727
MATT: All right, that finish your turn, Fjord?

00:57:39.727 --> 00:57:42.481
TRAVIS: Y--
SAM: The McRib is back!

00:57:42.481 --> 00:57:44.131
TRAVIS: Yes, it does!
(laughter)

00:57:44.131 --> 00:57:46.949
MATT: Okay, that brings us to Essek's turn.

00:57:46.949 --> 00:57:49.779
TRAVIS: ♪ I want my baby back, baby back ♪
MATT: Essek

00:57:49.779 --> 00:57:54.239
is just eyes wide, trying to take in what

00:57:54.239 --> 00:57:57.269
he's seeing here before shaking his head,

00:57:57.269 --> 00:57:59.869
getting back in the game and pulls the hands forward

00:57:59.869 --> 00:58:03.212
in front and is going to go ahead and attempt to cast,

00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:06.309
let's do Hold Monster on it.

00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:07.329
SAM: Hey.
MARISHA: Whoa.

00:58:07.329 --> 00:58:10.082
SAM: Normal non-dunamantic spell.

00:58:14.179 --> 00:58:16.029
MATT: Rolled a natural 18 to save, though.

00:58:17.629 --> 00:58:19.389
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:58:19.389 --> 00:58:20.539
That would've been fun.

00:58:21.809 --> 00:58:23.364
Okay, and that was at 6th-level.

00:58:23.364 --> 00:58:24.879
TALIESIN: Go big or go home.
TRAVIS: Oh, wizards.

00:58:24.879 --> 00:58:27.301
LIAM: Yeah. This is going to be awesome! Never mind.

00:58:27.301 --> 00:58:29.524
MARISHA: That was a melee attack?
MATT: Big swings and big misses.

00:58:29.524 --> 00:58:31.559
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:33.989
MATT: And with that, Essek's going to go ahead and--

00:58:33.989 --> 00:58:35.756
MARISHA: Oh no.
MATT: Hide behind here

00:58:35.756 --> 00:58:37.069
for the time being.
TALIESIN: Good call.

00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.902
MATT: Finishing Essek's go.

00:58:37.902 --> 00:58:39.078
Beau, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

00:58:39.078 --> 00:58:40.799
MARISHA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:42.299
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:43.240
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.239
TRAVIS: Add four points--
TALIESIN: No reaction, though.

00:58:45.239 --> 00:58:46.072
MATT: Ooh.

00:58:47.529 --> 00:58:48.969
MARISHA: It doesn't have a reaction?

00:58:48.969 --> 00:58:50.127
SAM: Remember.
TALIESIN: Burned it already, I believe.

00:58:50.127 --> 00:58:52.665
SAM: It can only tell the truth.
MATT: It did with Yasha.

00:58:52.665 --> 00:58:55.846
(laughter)

00:58:55.846 --> 00:58:57.596
MARISHA: Who is the Nonagon?

00:58:58.988 --> 00:59:02.609
I got to punch it, that's what I do.

00:59:02.609 --> 00:59:05.199
It's what I do, I'm going to punch it.

00:59:05.199 --> 00:59:06.139
This is going to be bad.

00:59:06.139 --> 00:59:08.839
One of them was a natural one. What the hell, y'all?

00:59:08.839 --> 00:59:11.549
That's the third nat one on an attack I've done.

00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:14.497
But the other is a natural 17 for 29.

00:59:14.497 --> 00:59:15.522
MATT: 29 does hit.

00:59:17.174 --> 00:59:19.899
MARISHA: That's good, 15 damage.

00:59:19.899 --> 00:59:21.399
MATT: 15 damage, all righty.

00:59:23.439 --> 00:59:26.059
And you take nine points of piercing damage

00:59:26.059 --> 00:59:28.929
as spines seem to erupt in reaction

00:59:28.929 --> 00:59:31.752
to you hitting it with the physical blow nearby.

00:59:31.752 --> 00:59:33.501
MARISHA: (groans)

00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:36.009
I immediately--

00:59:36.009 --> 00:59:38.094
MATT: It's looking hurt already, guys.
SAM: Sure.

00:59:38.094 --> 00:59:40.608
MATT: That Fjord round fucked it up.

00:59:40.608 --> 00:59:43.242
Oh, by the way, make a wisdom saving throw for me.

00:59:43.242 --> 00:59:45.422
SAM: Oh, by the way.

00:59:45.422 --> 00:59:46.709
MATT: Actually, Essek has to make one, too.

00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:48.286
TRAVIS: Yeah, and that fractal shit
did something to me, right?

00:59:48.286 --> 00:59:50.329
MATT: Essek failed.
MARISHA: 25.

00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:52.158
MATT: 25, you're fine.

00:59:52.158 --> 00:59:53.581
TRAVIS: Is that fractal stuff doing anything?

00:59:53.581 --> 00:59:55.695
MARISHA: It's got to do something.

00:59:58.489 --> 00:59:59.429
Completely shook by this,

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.589
I'm going to do a Patient Defense and go on guard.

01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:05.729
MATT: Okay, you shake off the patterns you're seeing

01:00:05.729 --> 01:00:08.522
and you pull back and they're weirdly familiar.

01:00:09.679 --> 01:00:11.859
MARISHA: From shit that I've seen in dreams?

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:13.129
MATT: And read in books.

01:00:13.129 --> 01:00:15.709
MARISHA: And read in books.

01:00:15.709 --> 01:00:16.919
MATT: That finishes your turn.

01:00:16.919 --> 01:00:19.199
All right, Caduceus, you're up, unless you want to move.

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:21.639
SAM: What books you be reading?
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:00:23.016 --> 01:00:25.480
Tusk Love gets weird at the end.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.362
(laughter)

01:00:26.362 --> 01:00:29.544
SAM: That weird shit from Tusk Love!
MARISHA: That weird shit, yeah.

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:31.523
Chapter nine gets weird.

01:00:31.523 --> 01:00:33.419
TRAVIS: "Chapter nine."

01:00:33.419 --> 01:00:35.339
MATT: So does that finish your turn?
You're staying put or you want to move?

01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:37.164
MARISHA: No, I'm staying put with Patient Defense.

01:00:37.164 --> 01:00:38.529
MATT: You got up Patient Defense, got it.

01:00:38.529 --> 01:00:39.709
That brings us to Caduceus.

01:00:39.709 --> 01:00:41.189
TALIESIN: Am I still stuck in the goop?

01:00:41.189 --> 01:00:42.899
MATT: You still have a speed of zero

01:00:42.899 --> 01:00:43.929
and I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

01:00:43.929 --> 01:00:47.529
TALIESIN: All right, let's do this
wisdom saving throw, come on.

01:00:47.529 --> 01:00:48.719
19.

01:00:48.719 --> 01:00:49.902
MATT: 19?

01:00:52.009 --> 01:00:53.859
Okay, good to know.

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:55.859
TALIESIN: I hate that you say that.

01:00:55.859 --> 01:00:57.949
So I would still have to make,

01:00:57.949 --> 01:00:59.799
I'm being held by this.
MATT: Correct.

01:00:59.799 --> 01:01:02.129
You cannot move unless you use
an action to try and break free.

01:01:02.129 --> 01:01:04.089
TALIESIN: But nothing weird seems to be happening?

01:01:04.089 --> 01:01:05.939
MATT: No, it's just holding you in place.

01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:09.539
For now.

01:01:09.539 --> 01:01:10.964
TALIESIN: Fucker.

01:01:14.169 --> 01:01:15.719
Yeah, you know what? I'll give it one more.

01:01:15.719 --> 01:01:18.559
I'm going to do the same thing as I did last time.

01:01:18.559 --> 01:01:21.939
MATT: Okay. So you're holding on and waiting?

01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:25.809
TALIESIN: Holding on and waiting, same idea.

01:01:25.809 --> 01:01:27.059
MATT: You've got it.

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:29.892
All right, it is now "Cree's" turn.

01:01:31.009 --> 01:01:34.099
Cree is going to go ahead and first,

01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:36.298
release Hungry Tendrils.

01:01:36.298 --> 01:01:37.927
SAM: ♪ Hungry Tendrils ♪
MATT: Elements of the body,

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.252
these handl-- (laughs)

01:01:41.783 --> 01:01:45.379
handless, whirling whips of flesh

01:01:45.379 --> 01:01:49.496
begin to spin around before striking out towards--

01:01:51.689 --> 01:01:54.749
The people that are there are--

01:01:54.749 --> 01:01:57.649
One hit to Fjord, one hit to Beau, and one hit to Caduceus.

01:01:58.832 --> 01:02:00.856
So against you, Fjord.

01:02:00.856 --> 01:02:03.012
That's going to be 13.

01:02:03.012 --> 01:02:04.059
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:02:04.059 --> 01:02:05.489
MATT: Against you, Beauregard.

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:07.969
MARISHA: Disadvantage.
MATT: With disadvantage.

01:02:07.969 --> 01:02:09.789
Disadvantage is going to bring it down to 15.

01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:10.926
MARISHA: Nope.

01:02:10.926 --> 01:02:13.069
MATT: And Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah, hurt me.

01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:14.779
MATT: 11, wow, rolled really bad.

01:02:14.779 --> 01:02:17.029
MATT: Can I use my Shield of Retribution on that?

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:20.646
TRAVIS: Does it have to hit you?

01:02:20.646 --> 01:02:22.369
TALIESIN: No, it has to miss with a melee attack.

01:02:22.369 --> 01:02:23.899
MATT: It does have to miss the melee attack, yes.

01:02:23.899 --> 01:02:25.439
TALIESIN: Is this technically a melee attack?

01:02:25.439 --> 01:02:28.067
MATT: It is. It's not next to you, but yeah, I'll allow it.

01:02:28.067 --> 01:02:29.964
I'll allow it.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:02:29.964 --> 01:02:31.179
MATT: You're blasting the tendril as it

01:02:31.179 --> 01:02:33.289
swings past and doesn't quite get purchase

01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:36.389
or it grabs the shield and you use the shield to (crunch)

01:02:36.389 --> 01:02:37.229
blast it back.

01:02:37.229 --> 01:02:39.339
TALIESIN: Holy fucking shit.

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:40.719
Okay.

01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:42.639
(laughter)

01:02:42.639 --> 01:02:44.189
MARISHA: Yep, those are lots of sixes.

01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:47.779
That's a good roll.

01:02:47.779 --> 01:02:50.048
TALIESIN: 21 points of force damage.

01:02:50.048 --> 01:02:51.479
MATT: Nice!
ASHLEY: Dang.

01:02:51.479 --> 01:02:53.279
TALIESIN: And I suppose it has to make--

01:02:53.279 --> 01:02:54.537
MATT: Was it a reaction to do that?

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.339
TALIESIN: It is a reaction.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:57.299
MATT: Have you used your reaction?
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

01:02:57.299 --> 01:02:59.149
I can't do it then, never mind.
MATT: Can't do it.

01:02:59.149 --> 01:03:01.089
TALIESIN: I did already use my reaction, never mind.

01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:02.589
TRAVIS: That's okay, you've been clutch.

01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:04.189
TALIESIN: I don't care.

01:03:04.189 --> 01:03:06.249
MATT: In your imagination, you have this really cool moment

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:08.091
and then you look back and go, "Damn it."

01:03:08.091 --> 01:03:09.439
(laughter)
TALIESIN: That was the wisdom saving throw.

01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:10.614
Ah, oh.

01:03:10.614 --> 01:03:11.447
MATT: Yep.

01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:14.259
MARISHA: Daydreamed through your reaction.

01:03:14.259 --> 01:03:15.092
MATT: All righty.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:16.569
TRAVIS: Save it for the [Inaudible].
TALIESIN: That would've been clutch.

01:03:16.569 --> 01:03:18.919
MATT: That finishes its turn because

01:03:18.919 --> 01:03:21.479
you're still holding your reaction as your held turn.

01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:24.299
It's also now going to go ahead and do a claw.

01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:26.949
So it does get two claw attacks after the Hungry Tendrils.

01:03:28.569 --> 01:03:31.639
That's going to be against both of you
because you're the closest.

01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:33.055
So against you, Fjord.

01:03:33.055 --> 01:03:34.709
That is going to be a 23 to hit.

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:37.489
TRAVIS: 23 hits, but I'm going to roll my Armor of Hexes

01:03:37.489 --> 01:03:39.399
and roll a six, so he misses.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:40.810
MATT: He does.

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:43.560
TRAVIS: She! Excuse me, she.
MARISHA: Oh! Hell yeah.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.572
MATT: And then against you also with disadvantage.

01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:49.569
What would have been a natural 20

01:03:49.569 --> 01:03:51.982
is instead turned into a 17.

01:03:52.898 --> 01:03:53.731
SAM: Dude.
TALIESIN: I saw it

01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:55.559
happen on your face of that ah, oh.

01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:57.172
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

01:03:58.229 --> 01:03:59.062
Well done.

01:03:59.062 --> 01:04:00.449
Well, it misses you.

01:04:00.449 --> 01:04:02.989
MARISHA: All that viscous liquid
he's covered in. He's just--

01:04:02.989 --> 01:04:04.979
MATT: Indeed, you can attack, if you want to.

01:04:04.979 --> 01:04:06.539
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:04:06.539 --> 01:04:07.849
ASHLEY: Kill it, baby.

01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:09.229
MARISHA: Because he's looking real bad, yeah?

01:04:09.229 --> 01:04:10.359
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: All right, yeah.

01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:11.859
Fuck it, let's go.

01:04:11.859 --> 01:04:12.859
MATT: Okay, so you take your reaction

01:04:12.859 --> 01:04:15.349
to strike back after it misses you.

01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:17.022
MARISHA: That's not a ki point, right?

01:04:17.022 --> 01:04:18.279
MATT: No, it's just a reaction to do it.

01:04:18.279 --> 01:04:20.374
MARISHA: Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.

01:04:20.374 --> 01:04:22.179
MATT: It's a ki point to get additional reactions.

01:04:22.179 --> 01:04:23.869
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: A whole other game going on over here.

01:04:23.869 --> 01:04:25.909
MARISHA: 22.
MATT: Yeah.

01:04:25.909 --> 01:04:27.801
It's really fascinating.

01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.020
MARISHA: 22.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:29.853
MATT: 22.
MARISHA: Hits?

01:04:29.853 --> 01:04:31.422
MATT: Yeah, that hits.
SAM: -- the ball out of the pucker.

01:04:32.689 --> 01:04:34.389
MARISHA: I just get the one attack, right?

01:04:34.389 --> 01:04:35.567
MATT: Circumstantially, we're never going to see

01:04:35.567 --> 01:04:36.500
the battlefield that they're in.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.409
I'll show you the break.

01:04:37.409 --> 01:04:38.959
MARISHA: 14.

01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:40.060
MATT: 14.
MARISHA: Points of damage.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.149
MATT: Point of damage, great.

01:04:42.149 --> 01:04:44.556
And you take, in reaction to that--

01:04:44.556 --> 01:04:45.389
MARISHA: That's okay.

01:04:47.529 --> 01:04:48.968
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:52.089
MARISHA: Lord, have fucking mercy.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.702
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: What?

01:04:53.702 --> 01:04:57.659
MARISHA: I just took 14 points
of damage for punching it, ouch.

01:04:57.659 --> 01:04:59.416
MATT: That finishes--
TRAVIS: That sucks.

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:01.719
MATT: -- its turn, it's not going to move.

01:05:01.719 --> 01:05:03.967
Jester, you're up, with Veth on deck.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:05.611
LAURA: Is the--

01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:09.059
Is the gem back all the way up?

01:05:09.059 --> 01:05:11.989
MATT: The gem has now been drawn
back up into the space and you

01:05:11.989 --> 01:05:15.399
get the sense you have one more shot at this before it,

01:05:15.399 --> 01:05:18.389
it now has sensed danger around it.

01:05:18.389 --> 01:05:20.099
You guys managed to pull it partially free

01:05:20.099 --> 01:05:21.129
and it's been trying to recover it.

01:05:21.129 --> 01:05:23.149
Now that it's trying to withdraw it,

01:05:23.149 --> 01:05:25.457
this may be your last chance before it takes it away.

01:05:25.457 --> 01:05:29.489
LAURA: Me and Caleb, or is it
going to go back up after my turn?

01:05:29.489 --> 01:05:30.489
MATT: We'll find out.

01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:33.437
LIAM: Caleb is shaking a little pouch at Jester.

01:05:33.437 --> 01:05:35.604
LAURA: (grunting)

01:05:36.749 --> 01:05:38.809
I'm going to pick up Caleb

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:41.289
and lift him up so he can touch it.

01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:42.607
MATT: Okay, so you're just using your turn--

01:05:42.607 --> 01:05:44.129
LAURA: I'm using my turn to try--
MATT: No rolls needed.

01:05:44.129 --> 01:05:47.042
You go ahead and take Caleb and hold him aloft,

01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:50.789
which gets him to about a little over 20 feet.

01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:53.869
The stone now, you see it being slowly

01:05:53.869 --> 01:05:57.127
sunken back into the ceiling and it will be--

01:05:57.127 --> 01:05:59.518
This is your last shot because it'll
be out of touch range after your turn.

01:05:59.518 --> 01:06:00.649
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Awesome.

01:06:00.649 --> 01:06:02.309
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:04.013
MATT: That your turn, Jester?

01:06:04.013 --> 01:06:05.339
Veth, you're up with Yasha on deck.

01:06:05.339 --> 01:06:06.749
LAURA: Teamwork.

01:06:06.749 --> 01:06:07.799
MATT: That's awesome.

01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:09.917
TALIESIN: (snaps) Another snap let go of the thing.

01:06:09.917 --> 01:06:11.309
SAM: Another snap.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:13.159
SAM: Oh no, he's Jazzman again.

01:06:13.159 --> 01:06:14.475
TALIESIN: We're Jazz-manning this.

01:06:14.475 --> 01:06:16.989
(laughter)

01:06:16.989 --> 01:06:21.599
SAM: It looks scary over there, so
I'm going to stay where I am.

01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:24.286
Calmly reload.

01:06:24.286 --> 01:06:25.119
MATT: I would like for you to make

01:06:25.119 --> 01:06:27.259
a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:29.109
As you reload and look around the corner towards it

01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:31.099
and you see it writhing in the middle of the darkness

01:06:31.099 --> 01:06:33.729
and suddenly there's (slurping) these weird

01:06:33.729 --> 01:06:37.367
symbols in a holographic way shimmering

01:06:37.367 --> 01:06:39.669
and then vanishing around its body, these patterns.

01:06:39.669 --> 01:06:41.359
SAM: Nine.
MATT: Good to know.

01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:42.719
All right, continue with your turn.

01:06:42.719 --> 01:06:44.039
SAM: Good to know.

01:06:44.039 --> 01:06:45.579
TRAVIS: I got that also.

01:06:45.579 --> 01:06:47.786
SAM: I don't like the, "Good to know."

01:06:48.869 --> 01:06:52.619
I will fire my cross<i>bow</i> bolt.

01:06:52.619 --> 01:06:53.669
MATT: Roll for an attack.

01:06:54.879 --> 01:06:56.938
SAM: 18 plus 11 probably hits.

01:06:56.938 --> 01:06:58.819
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:06:58.819 --> 01:07:01.011
SAM: Sneak Attack damage.

01:07:01.011 --> 01:07:02.889
MATT: Caduceus, you're--?
TRAVIS: With that handful of dice.

01:07:02.889 --> 01:07:04.079
TALIESIN: I don't do this often, but yeah.

01:07:04.079 --> 01:07:06.610
SAM: Oh ho ho, it's good.

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:08.253
10, 20.
TRAVIS: You doing it again?

01:07:08.253 --> 01:07:11.261
ASHLEY: Come on, baby.
SAM: 30.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.581
40.
TALIESIN: I want this over.

01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:14.129
SAM: 40 points of damage.

01:07:14.129 --> 01:07:17.157
MATT: Doubled to 80 because of Caduceus.

01:07:18.459 --> 01:07:19.499
How do you want to do this?

01:07:19.499 --> 01:07:21.399
(cheering)

01:07:21.399 --> 01:07:23.352
MARISHA: There it is.
ASHLEY: There we go.

01:07:23.352 --> 01:07:24.633
SAM: Man.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanted this over.

01:07:24.633 --> 01:07:28.405
SAM: There's so many different body parts I can aim for.

01:07:28.405 --> 01:07:29.339
You know what I'm going to do,

01:07:29.339 --> 01:07:32.769
I'm aiming, I can't figure out what's a good part.

01:07:32.769 --> 01:07:34.269
I want to get to the undercarriage,

01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:36.989
so I'm going to try to skip it,

01:07:36.989 --> 01:07:40.462
skip the bolt off the flesh puddle and up.

01:07:40.462 --> 01:07:43.178
MARISHA: Bounce it off the water bed?

01:07:43.178 --> 01:07:44.011
TRAVIS: Ow!

01:07:44.011 --> 01:07:47.948
MATT: You know how reflective flesh is with bolts.

01:07:47.948 --> 01:07:49.834
(laughter)

01:07:49.834 --> 01:07:52.975
SAM: I lick it first, for a little spin.

01:07:52.975 --> 01:07:54.744
(laughter)

01:07:54.744 --> 01:07:57.339
SAM: That does it right, in movies? I don't know.

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.717
TRAVIS: Yep, totally.
MATT: Okay.

01:07:58.717 --> 01:07:59.550
TALIESIN: I should watch some of those.

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:01.073
MATT: Okay.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:06.159
I'm trying to logic this in my brain (laughs).

01:08:06.159 --> 01:08:08.552
SAM: I'd like to bend physics.
MATT: I understand.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:11.110
So here's what happens.

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:12.826
As you go to fire,

01:08:12.826 --> 01:08:16.292
the creature begins to burrow

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.079
its way into the flesh underground,

01:08:18.079 --> 01:08:20.879
like it's trying to escape or find

01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:24.059
more feasible defensive position

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:26.719
and as it begins to burrow in as you skip downward,

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:28.369
you watch as one of the arms pulls up

01:08:28.369 --> 01:08:31.009
and exposes the Cree head that's still

01:08:31.009 --> 01:08:34.619
screaming inside in the middle of the twisting skin

01:08:34.619 --> 01:08:37.159
and it (swoosh) hits right in the center of the head,

01:08:37.159 --> 01:08:39.469
at which point the body just (gurgles)

01:08:39.469 --> 01:08:42.089
immediately liquefies onto the ground.

01:08:42.089 --> 01:08:44.352
LAURA: Ew, liquid flesh.

01:08:44.352 --> 01:08:47.379
TRAVIS: Hexblade's Curse will get me 17 hit points back.

01:08:47.379 --> 01:08:48.529
MATT: Indeed.

01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:51.279
TRAVIS: Are there any immediate vials

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:55.354
of blood in the liquid flesh stuff?

01:08:55.354 --> 01:08:58.291
MATT: Oh yeah, you can find blood all throughout it, yeah.

01:08:58.291 --> 01:08:59.541
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:02.539
I start grabbing and grabbing, grab the stuff.

01:09:02.539 --> 01:09:05.639
MARISHA: Y'all better just grab whatever's in there.

01:09:05.639 --> 01:09:06.472
TALIESIN: Please.
MATT: Okay.

01:09:06.472 --> 01:09:08.391
SAM: Are you hurt?
TALIESIN: I'm stuck.

01:09:08.391 --> 01:09:09.872
SAM: Oh, you're stuck?

01:09:09.872 --> 01:09:12.701
ASHLEY: I'm going to come out and peek out.

01:09:12.701 --> 01:09:15.439
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I'll help, you're low.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:16.762
ASHLEY: Oh, fair.

01:09:18.089 --> 01:09:20.029
TRAVIS: I'll fire some Eldritch Blasts

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:21.459
at the tendrils holding Caduceus.

01:09:21.459 --> 01:09:23.966
MATT: Okay, we'll say it gives you your round and such,

01:09:23.966 --> 01:09:25.129
but you manage to go ahead and blast enough

01:09:25.129 --> 01:09:27.089
to give you advantage to try and break free.

01:09:27.089 --> 01:09:28.049
Go ahead and make it a strength--

01:09:28.049 --> 01:09:29.404
TRAVIS: Just in case it whipped out.

01:09:29.404 --> 01:09:31.262
MATT: Make a strength check with advantage.

01:09:33.119 --> 01:09:34.393
TALIESIN: Hey, 15.

01:09:34.393 --> 01:09:35.301
MATT: 15, easy enough.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:36.489
With Fjord's help clearing the way,

01:09:36.489 --> 01:09:37.829
you manage to stumble out of it.

01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:38.829
TALIESIN: That's disgusting.

01:09:39.771 --> 01:09:40.949
SAM: ♪ I want to break free ♪

01:09:40.949 --> 01:09:42.079
MATT: To give it a little bit of a visual here

01:09:42.079 --> 01:09:44.779
because I can now that we're finished with this combat,

01:09:45.699 --> 01:09:47.299
I'm going to go ahead and drift over to the other chamber

01:09:47.299 --> 01:09:49.170
where you both are so you can see where it ends.

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:50.413
(exclaiming)

01:09:50.413 --> 01:09:52.222
SAM: There's a second chamber?

01:09:52.222 --> 01:09:54.879
All chambers are brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:58.544
bit.ly/DwarvenForceCR, oh my god.

01:09:58.544 --> 01:09:59.816
TRAVIS: You're a big blue gorilla, right?

01:09:59.816 --> 01:10:01.699
LAURA: I'm a big blue ape.

01:10:01.699 --> 01:10:02.532
SAM: Japester.

01:10:03.665 --> 01:10:05.718
LAURA: (gorilla grunts)

01:10:05.718 --> 01:10:08.240
MATT: There we go.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.132
Okay, all right.

01:10:11.459 --> 01:10:12.379
LIAM: Get that blue ape.

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:13.557
MATT: There's where you are.

01:10:13.557 --> 01:10:15.800
TRAVIS: (triumphant laughter)
LAURA: (gorilla grunts)

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.050
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:19.382
MATT: Big old ape right there.

01:10:20.469 --> 01:10:24.649
With a Caleb riding on top.

01:10:24.649 --> 01:10:26.249
LAURA: Oh, we're in the midst of all this lava?

01:10:26.249 --> 01:10:27.339
TRAVIS: Just as I planned.
MATT: That is not lava.

01:10:27.339 --> 01:10:29.459
LIAM: Flesh lava.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:30.439
MARISHA: The flesh is lava.

01:10:30.439 --> 01:10:31.272
TALIESIN: That's goop.

01:10:31.272 --> 01:10:33.276
MATT: The Flesh is Lava is the worst game.

01:10:33.276 --> 01:10:34.929
(laughter)

01:10:34.929 --> 01:10:36.372
TRAVIS: The Floor is Lava's one thing.

01:10:36.372 --> 01:10:39.791
The Floor is <i>Flesh</i> is fucking another.

01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:41.679
LIAM: What a good way to die.

01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:42.833
TRAVIS: Come home from elementary school,

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:44.809
your mom's going to wonder about what games you're playing.

01:10:44.809 --> 01:10:47.446
MATT: Indeed.
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) "The floor is flesh!" "What?!"

01:10:47.446 --> 01:10:48.279
MARISHA: Yeah (laughs).

01:10:48.279 --> 01:10:50.349
MATT: With that, Caleb, what are you going to do?

01:10:50.349 --> 01:10:54.369
LIAM: So this is a two-part plan as Japester holds me up.

01:10:54.369 --> 01:10:57.059
First, I use a bonus action to have Cat's Ire

01:10:57.059 --> 01:11:00.809
yank it one last time, just as a bonus action.

01:11:00.809 --> 01:11:01.642
MATT: All righty.

01:11:02.579 --> 01:11:03.929
MARISHA: Roll good.
MATT: This is now

01:11:04.839 --> 01:11:06.749
drifting upward, we'll say--

01:11:06.749 --> 01:11:07.582
TRAVIS: Dope mini.

01:11:07.582 --> 01:11:09.309
LAURA: I'm trying to help you.

01:11:09.309 --> 01:11:10.669
MARISHA: You're like the Bob's Big Boy.

01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:12.739
LAURA: Yeah (laughs).
LIAM: Did you order a wizard, sir?

01:11:12.739 --> 01:11:14.556
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Wizard, wizard?

01:11:14.556 --> 01:11:15.621
MATT: I'd say right there is

01:11:15.621 --> 01:11:17.714
the Cat's Ire that's helping you out.

01:11:17.714 --> 01:11:18.877
SAM: Fucking Matt.

01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:20.237
MATT: So go ahead and roll.
LIAM: 18.

01:11:20.237 --> 01:11:22.809
18 with the paw strength.
MATT: 18?

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:23.699
18 isn't enough.

01:11:23.699 --> 01:11:24.729
LIAM: Isn't enough?
MATT: It's not helping.

01:11:24.729 --> 01:11:26.097
LIAM: That's okay. Second thing I'm going to do

01:11:26.097 --> 01:11:29.609
is smash a bag of gold dust across it

01:11:29.609 --> 01:11:31.119
and before it goes all the way in,

01:11:31.119 --> 01:11:33.612
cast Immovable Object on the gem.

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.208
TALIESIN: What?

01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:41.759
MATT: As all the tendrils tighten and pull,

01:11:41.759 --> 01:11:46.228
the threshold crest (clicks) becomes a fixed point in space.

01:11:46.228 --> 01:11:47.348
(cheering)

01:11:47.348 --> 01:11:48.181
MARISHA: Brilliant!

01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:49.014
TRAVIS: You are the best!

01:11:49.014 --> 01:11:49.939
MATT: And you watch as--

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.255
MARISHA: That is so good!

01:11:51.255 --> 01:11:52.669
MATT: The tendrils are attempting

01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:57.389
to pull and pull and as it extends,

01:11:57.389 --> 01:12:00.959
it's unable to grasp the stone.

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:04.739
It's stuck just beyond its ability to connect.

01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:05.929
ASHLEY: Good job.
SAM: Nice.

01:12:05.929 --> 01:12:08.319
LIAM: I say: Ha ha, go to hell, dream people.

01:12:08.319 --> 01:12:10.399
And I will use my movement to turn and curl

01:12:10.399 --> 01:12:11.932
like a small baby monkey

01:12:11.932 --> 01:12:16.061
into the grip of mama monkey.

01:12:16.061 --> 01:12:17.159
MATT: (laughs)

01:12:17.159 --> 01:12:18.829
TRAVIS: Checking for ticks.
MATT: Okay.

01:12:18.829 --> 01:12:20.952
LAURA: Yeah, I start looking for ticks.

01:12:20.952 --> 01:12:22.398
SAM: Probably lots of ticks.

01:12:22.398 --> 01:12:24.869
LIAM: (panting)

01:12:24.869 --> 01:12:26.079
MATT: How long does that last?
TRAVIS: Pulling off his ears.

01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:28.129
LIAM: One hour.
MATT: One hour, you got it.

01:12:28.129 --> 01:12:29.569
TRAVIS: (crunch) Ah!

01:12:29.569 --> 01:12:32.139
LIAM: And it's got a password to be moved.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:33.889
MATT: You've got it.
TRAVIS: Oh wow.

01:12:33.889 --> 01:12:35.626
What a fucking spell, man.

01:12:35.626 --> 01:12:36.459
ASHLEY: Good idea.

01:12:36.459 --> 01:12:37.767
SAM: What's the password?
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:39.329
LIAM: I'll tell you when you get here.

01:12:39.329 --> 01:12:40.429
MATT: All right, so the rest of you,

01:12:40.429 --> 01:12:42.173
I gather you're going to catch up with your friends?

01:12:42.173 --> 01:12:43.690
ASHLEY: We were able to get all Cree's stuff?

01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:47.109
MARISHA: Yeah, anything in Cree's fleshy sack?

01:12:47.109 --> 01:12:48.571
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:49.546
TRAVIS: Could I assist?

01:12:49.546 --> 01:12:51.546
MARISHA: Yep, thank you.

01:12:53.546 --> 01:12:55.222
LIAM: He has to get here.

01:12:55.222 --> 01:12:58.153
MARISHA: All right, that's okay, 23.

01:12:59.506 --> 01:13:00.882
23.
MATT: Okay.

01:13:03.099 --> 01:13:05.839
You find within, and it'll take you a little bit.

01:13:05.839 --> 01:13:06.836
LIAM: When spoken.

01:13:06.836 --> 01:13:07.878
TRAVIS: (squelching)
TALIESIN: Double Dare.

01:13:07.878 --> 01:13:09.574
MATT: Yeah, it's--
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:13:09.574 --> 01:13:10.656
TRAVIS: Did you say Double Dare?

01:13:10.656 --> 01:13:11.856
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: That's horrible.

01:13:11.856 --> 01:13:12.714
That's Double Dare.

01:13:12.714 --> 01:13:14.393
MARISHA: Gotta go up the nose, exactly.

01:13:14.393 --> 01:13:16.265
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Oh my god, yes.

01:13:16.265 --> 01:13:20.966
MATT: You are reaching through the people slurry to find--

01:13:22.039 --> 01:13:23.595
TRAVIS: Wow.
MARISHA: People slurry.

01:13:23.595 --> 01:13:24.948
TRAVIS: Find the flag.

01:13:24.948 --> 01:13:27.031
(laughter)

01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:29.527
MATT: Marc Summers could not deal with this.

01:13:29.527 --> 01:13:30.360
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:13:31.589 --> 01:13:32.969
MATT: Sorry, Marc.

01:13:32.969 --> 01:13:36.469
You find the war pick that Cree had at her side,

01:13:36.469 --> 01:13:38.449
though you never see her use it.

01:13:38.449 --> 01:13:41.949
You found a satchel that contains

01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:44.929
numerous, numerous capsules of blood.

01:13:44.929 --> 01:13:45.762
MARISHA: Yes.

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:50.322
MATT: You also find a Cape of the Mountebank.

01:13:50.322 --> 01:13:51.329
MARISHA: Yes.

01:13:51.329 --> 01:13:52.578
TRAVIS: Cape of the what?

01:13:52.578 --> 01:13:53.811
TALIESIN: Cape of the Mountebank.

01:13:53.811 --> 01:13:55.696
MARISHA: That's what she was using to bamf.

01:13:55.696 --> 01:13:57.629
LIAM: Vax had that for five minutes.

01:13:57.629 --> 01:13:58.535
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Mountebank?

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.453
LIAM: That's how he turned on the acid.

01:14:00.453 --> 01:14:02.749
MATT and LAURA: (exaggerated French accent) Mountebank.

01:14:02.749 --> 01:14:04.249
SAM: One of his 17 cloaks?
MATT: My apologies if you are French.

01:14:04.249 --> 01:14:06.459
TRAVIS: On the rack.
TALIESIN: From the cloak room.

01:14:06.459 --> 01:14:08.539
MARISHA: It didn't match his aesthetics, though.

01:14:08.539 --> 01:14:11.069
MATT: Indeed, that is what you find.

01:14:11.069 --> 01:14:12.192
Everything else--
MARISHA: What was that?

01:14:12.192 --> 01:14:13.829
MATT: That is what you find, everything else seems

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:16.969
to have been either assimilated or destroyed.

01:14:16.969 --> 01:14:19.559
MARISHA: So war pick, capsules of blood, the cape.

01:14:19.559 --> 01:14:20.979
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:14:20.979 --> 01:14:22.129
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:14:24.289 --> 01:14:25.122
All right.

01:14:27.639 --> 01:14:29.693
LIAM: You're still an ape and I still have Cat's Ire up.

01:14:29.693 --> 01:14:32.019
So the two of them could--

01:14:32.019 --> 01:14:34.559
TRAVIS: Do we identify, of those individual blood capsules,

01:14:34.559 --> 01:14:36.319
the one that was hanging around her neck?

01:14:36.319 --> 01:14:38.639
It had a piece of leather and it was a smaller one?

01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:39.909
MARISHA: Yeah, the little bead.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:41.029
TRAVIS: Can we see that in the goop?

01:14:41.029 --> 01:14:44.769
Because I would look for that more than the individual ones.

01:14:44.769 --> 01:14:46.756
MATT: Make an investigation check
on your own, if you don't mind.

01:14:46.756 --> 01:14:48.280
ASHLEY: Also-- Can I assist him?

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.113
SAM: Also!

01:14:49.113 --> 01:14:51.569
(laughter)

01:14:51.569 --> 01:14:53.169
TRAVIS: 13 plus seven, 20.

01:14:53.169 --> 01:14:54.217
MATT: 20.
MARISHA: Pretty good.

01:14:54.217 --> 01:14:55.050
MATT: You don't need to assist.

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:56.639
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

01:14:56.639 --> 01:14:59.129
MATT: And no, you couldn't have, because this was his--

01:14:59.129 --> 01:15:00.097
ASHLEY: I know, I know.
MATT: Just making a point there.

01:15:00.097 --> 01:15:00.930
ASHLEY: Just grasping at straws here.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:02.366
MATT: I know, and I appreciate that.

01:15:03.746 --> 01:15:05.716
TALIESIN: Who doesn't love straws?

01:15:05.716 --> 01:15:06.549
ASHLEY: I know!

01:15:08.599 --> 01:15:10.410
MATT: You do manage to find it.

01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:14.959
You find the tether and the orb that contains,

01:15:14.959 --> 01:15:17.169
it looks like it's about 80 to 85%

01:15:17.169 --> 01:15:20.129
filled with a blood-like viscous liquid

01:15:20.129 --> 01:15:23.389
that as you turn it over, you can see it shift within.

01:15:23.389 --> 01:15:24.222
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:15:26.592 --> 01:15:28.097
Got this.

01:15:28.097 --> 01:15:28.930
SAM: What's that?

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:31.679
TRAVIS: I don't know, it was what was around her neck.

01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:34.369
Obviously it had a place of pride, so important, maybe?

01:15:34.369 --> 01:15:35.369
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Yes, good.

01:15:35.369 --> 01:15:36.419
TRAVIS: All right, I'll hold onto it.

01:15:36.419 --> 01:15:38.439
I'll tie it, wrap it around my hand,

01:15:38.439 --> 01:15:40.351
so I palm it.
MARISHA: I wonder if that's

01:15:40.351 --> 01:15:42.309
Lucien's or something?
TRAVIS: It could be.

01:15:42.309 --> 01:15:44.059
ASHLEY: Should we go see

01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:44.900
what's going on?
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should go.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.039
TALIESIN: I'm already making my way into the--

01:15:47.039 --> 01:15:48.727
ALL: ♪ Making my way ♪

01:15:48.727 --> 01:15:50.560
SAM: How are your eyes, Beau?

01:15:52.479 --> 01:15:53.529
Same, normal?

01:15:53.529 --> 01:15:54.789
MARISHA: How are they?

01:15:54.789 --> 01:15:55.959
MATT: Seems normal.

01:15:55.959 --> 01:15:57.492
MARISHA: Seems okay.
SAM: Okay.

01:15:57.492 --> 01:15:58.929
MARISHA: I was getting--

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.299
MATT: Though as you hear Veth saying this

01:16:01.299 --> 01:16:02.799
and you look at yourself and you're fine,

01:16:02.799 --> 01:16:03.999
you look up at Veth and as Veth

01:16:03.999 --> 01:16:05.959
is looking at you with intent, you see

01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:08.119
a red eye in the center of Veth's forehead.

01:16:08.119 --> 01:16:09.002
MARISHA: No way!

01:16:10.239 --> 01:16:11.599
For real?
MATT: Yeah.

01:16:12.839 --> 01:16:14.239
SAM: Why are you looking at me?

01:16:17.309 --> 01:16:18.809
MARISHA: Uh-oh.
TRAVIS: What?

01:16:18.809 --> 01:16:21.409
MARISHA: Uh-oh, look at Veth's forehead.

01:16:21.409 --> 01:16:22.829
TRAVIS: We look at Veth's forehead.

01:16:22.829 --> 01:16:26.316
MATT: You see one of the red eyes of the Somnovem.

01:16:26.316 --> 01:16:28.048
TRAVIS: Ooh! You have a--

01:16:29.289 --> 01:16:31.779
poke your forehead, poke it.

01:16:31.779 --> 01:16:34.329
MARISHA: Is that because you got the killing blow on Cree?

01:16:35.489 --> 01:16:37.199
SAM: Maybe?

01:16:37.199 --> 01:16:38.944
MARISHA: Does anybody else have one?

01:16:38.944 --> 01:16:40.388
TRAVIS: I start looking, looking, looking.

01:16:40.388 --> 01:16:43.299
MARISHA: Yasha? I lift up the back of Yasha's shirt.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:44.419
Look on her back.

01:16:44.419 --> 01:16:46.729
MATT: Yasha is fine.
ASHLEY: I get completely naked.

01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:48.135
(laughter)

01:16:48.135 --> 01:16:49.325
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa.

01:16:51.157 --> 01:16:52.800
MATT: Yasha's fine.
LIAM: Heavy metal.

01:16:54.539 --> 01:16:56.349
MATT: You--
TRAVIS: No.

01:16:56.349 --> 01:16:59.622
MATT: -- find in the center of the left palm, a red eye.

01:17:03.493 --> 01:17:05.070
ASHLEY: Caduceus?
MATT: And you remember--

01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:06.413
Well, Caduceus has already bolted off.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:07.546
TALIESIN: I'm already in the other room.

01:17:07.546 --> 01:17:10.339
MATT: You recall that when you saw that flash of a pattern,

01:17:10.339 --> 01:17:14.102
there was this faint tickle on your hand that you

01:17:14.102 --> 01:17:16.852
didn't connect to anything in the middle of the moment.

01:17:20.329 --> 01:17:21.757
TRAVIS: I touch Veth's forehead.

01:17:21.757 --> 01:17:25.629
TRAVIS and SAM: (screaming)

01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:26.923
MATT: I need you both to-- no.

01:17:26.923 --> 01:17:28.713
(laughter)

01:17:28.713 --> 01:17:32.109
TRAVIS and LIAM: (slurping)

01:17:32.109 --> 01:17:34.842
SAM: (British accent) Hello, I'm Fjord now.

01:17:35.997 --> 01:17:37.381
TRAVIS: (screams like Veth)

01:17:37.381 --> 01:17:38.791
(laughter)

01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:40.680
SAM: (like Fjord) Why is everyone looking at me like that?

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.664
TRAVIS: (screeches like Veth)

01:17:42.985 --> 01:17:45.097
LAURA: (screeches like Veth)

01:17:45.097 --> 01:17:47.194
SAM: Wee!

01:17:47.194 --> 01:17:48.978
TRAVIS: (like Veth) I'm a goblin!

01:17:51.592 --> 01:17:52.940
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.271
Wait, did you fail?
TRAVIS: We should go.

01:17:54.271 --> 01:17:55.593
We should catch up, yes?
SAM: I failed.

01:17:55.593 --> 01:17:56.426
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:17:56.426 --> 01:17:57.357
TRAVIS: We'll figure this out.
ASHLEY: Let's go, let's go.

01:17:57.357 --> 01:17:58.506
TRAVIS: We're running.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:17:58.506 --> 01:17:59.339
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: Fine.

01:17:59.339 --> 01:18:00.172
MATT: All right.

01:18:01.359 --> 01:18:02.669
Caduceus, you're the first to arrive

01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:04.289
into this chamber and looking across the way,

01:18:04.289 --> 01:18:08.919
you can see there, floating in the air, the Cat's Ire

01:18:10.459 --> 01:18:13.139
arcane claw hovering,

01:18:13.139 --> 01:18:17.589
a massive blue ape that is cradling a very tired Caleb,

01:18:17.589 --> 01:18:19.529
and there you see

01:18:20.969 --> 01:18:24.779
just below the ceiling edifice

01:18:24.779 --> 01:18:28.409
to where the threshold crest would be held

01:18:28.409 --> 01:18:32.842
is the threshold crest, but just held aloft mystically.

01:18:33.859 --> 01:18:35.109
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:38.911
ASHLEY: Essek, can I give you a quick look-see?

01:18:38.911 --> 01:18:40.764
Because I think you-- (whispering) think you failed

01:18:40.764 --> 01:18:42.941
a wisdom saving throw at one point.

01:18:42.941 --> 01:18:44.132
MATT: Essek

01:18:47.649 --> 01:18:50.226
looks at his hands. "I think I'm fine."

01:18:53.666 --> 01:18:55.473
ASHLEY: Okay, well.

01:18:55.473 --> 01:18:58.397
SAM: Want to put on some clothes there, Yasha?

01:18:58.397 --> 01:18:59.230
ASHLEY: No.

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:02.303
MATT: He pulls up the sleeves on his arm.

01:19:02.303 --> 01:19:06.556
Nothing there, and he turns around
and pulls back the mantle,

01:19:06.556 --> 01:19:09.103
and on the right shoulder blade,

01:19:09.103 --> 01:19:09.940
you see a red eye.

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.373
LAURA: (gasps)
LIAM: (groans)

01:19:13.513 --> 01:19:14.763
LAURA: Oops!

01:19:14.763 --> 01:19:19.593
TRAVIS: So we kind of joined you in your things.

01:19:19.593 --> 01:19:21.291
How's that going?

01:19:22.283 --> 01:19:23.883
LIAM: Jester. I tap her cheek.

01:19:23.883 --> 01:19:26.881
You can put me down, thank you.

01:19:26.881 --> 01:19:27.805
LAURA: (grunts)

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:29.641
TALIESIN: Are we okay with this,
or do we want to try and--

01:19:29.641 --> 01:19:32.043
LIAM: No, this is a stopgap measure.

01:19:32.043 --> 01:19:36.743
We've got about 59 minutes left where that is held in place

01:19:36.743 --> 01:19:39.393
before the ceiling starts to suck it back in.

01:19:39.393 --> 01:19:40.623
I think maybe we try

01:19:40.623 --> 01:19:44.776
to burn, slash, destroy the flesh around it.

01:19:44.776 --> 01:19:47.387
TALIESIN: What do you think about

01:19:47.387 --> 01:19:49.903
necrotic, necromantic power?

01:19:49.903 --> 01:19:52.213
LIAM: I think so, and I can make it.

01:19:52.213 --> 01:19:54.683
Right now, I have it held in place,

01:19:54.683 --> 01:19:57.093
and I can let it drop if we can get

01:19:58.123 --> 01:20:01.423
all of the fleshy goo to let go of it.

01:20:01.423 --> 01:20:03.470
TALIESIN: Well, I've got some stuff I can do,

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:06.453
but we should wait, if we've got a little time,

01:20:06.453 --> 01:20:08.310
we should probably wait.
ASHLEY: I could try to start hacking away.

01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:11.333
TALIESIN: And, I got to say, I'm running out of tricks.

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:13.863
LAURA: Yeah, I go and I pick Yasha up

01:20:13.863 --> 01:20:14.963
and I just lift her up to it

01:20:14.963 --> 01:20:16.603
so she can hack at it, if she wants to.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:18.733
TRAVIS: She's super low on health, by the way,

01:20:18.733 --> 01:20:20.812
just in case we're interrupted.

01:20:20.812 --> 01:20:21.912
LIAM: So am I.
ASHLEY: Well,

01:20:21.912 --> 01:20:25.693
we can, if we can take a napsies.

01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:28.213
TALIESIN: I can burn a spell.
SAM: If we get this thing down,

01:20:28.213 --> 01:20:30.243
that will take the immediate threat off of us.

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:31.773
LIAM: If we can get it down quick,

01:20:31.773 --> 01:20:35.153
I can hold it in place on the ground, and then we can rest.

01:20:35.153 --> 01:20:37.513
SAM: I can blow it up.
TALIESIN: Let me try something.

01:20:37.513 --> 01:20:38.723
SAM: I can blow it up.
TALIESIN: You ready?

01:20:38.723 --> 01:20:40.763
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Oh, pull Yasha away.

01:20:40.763 --> 01:20:42.433
TRAVIS: I'll stand up by the hallway, actually,

01:20:42.433 --> 01:20:44.683
the one that we came down, and just keep eye

01:20:44.683 --> 01:20:48.443
on the hallway of esophagus.

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:49.965
SAM: Which eye? This eye?
LAURA: Yeah, I hold Yasha

01:20:49.965 --> 01:20:52.433
and I walk to--
ASHLEY: To go over here.

01:20:52.433 --> 01:20:54.687
LAURA: To the door.
TALIESIN: I assume

01:20:54.687 --> 01:20:57.241
that I can target this thing with a Blight spell, right?

01:20:57.241 --> 01:20:58.766
MATT: Hold on, I need to grab

01:20:58.766 --> 01:20:59.916
SAM: Using the wrong palm.

01:21:01.206 --> 01:21:03.903
LAURA: Like you're Ronin.
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

01:21:03.903 --> 01:21:07.657
SAM: Oh, sorry, yes, we are part of the Nonagon now, sorry.

01:21:07.657 --> 01:21:08.868
LIAM: The claw's probably gone now.

01:21:08.868 --> 01:21:11.434
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a quick eyeball check.

01:21:11.434 --> 01:21:13.809
MARISHA: Yeah, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Quick eyeball check.

01:21:13.809 --> 01:21:17.054
MARISHA: Look under Caduceus' shirt, in the back as well.

01:21:17.054 --> 01:21:19.721
TALIESIN: Eyeball check.
MARISHA: Eyeball check.

01:21:23.303 --> 01:21:25.493
MATT: Caduceus, right in the center of the clavicle,

01:21:25.493 --> 01:21:26.843
on the chest, there is a red eye.

01:21:26.843 --> 01:21:28.613
TRAVIS: Who's the only one that doesn't have one?

01:21:28.613 --> 01:21:30.081
MARISHA: Jester.
SAM: Yasha.

01:21:30.081 --> 01:21:32.634
LAURA: And Yasha.
TRAVIS: Jester and Yasha. Okay.

01:21:32.634 --> 01:21:33.984
ASHLEY: You and me, baby.

01:21:33.984 --> 01:21:36.393
TRAVIS: Ooh shit, that's going to have a consequence.

01:21:36.393 --> 01:21:38.793
LAURA: I'm holding Yasha like a little baby

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.163
and we're walking out, you know,

01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:43.503
farther from the stone so Caduceus can try something.

01:21:43.503 --> 01:21:45.453
TALIESIN: We may need you to go in right after I'm done.

01:21:45.453 --> 01:21:46.286
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:21:46.286 --> 01:21:48.673
LIAM: All right, I'll stand with Caduceus.

01:21:48.673 --> 01:21:51.093
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is a 30-foot spell, so I got some room.

01:21:51.093 --> 01:21:53.058
MATT: Okay, you still have to get

01:21:53.058 --> 01:21:54.733
somewhat near the center to do it,

01:21:54.733 --> 01:21:57.433
just because it is about 20, 25 feet up.

01:21:57.433 --> 01:21:58.363
TALIESIN: Sure.

01:21:58.363 --> 01:22:00.023
MATT: Though it's only 20 feet up because of your spell, so.

01:22:00.023 --> 01:22:01.523
TALIESIN: I'll take another step back.

01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:03.843
Get away from all that flesh.

01:22:03.843 --> 01:22:06.483
Well, the flesh, it seems like it's being fine.

01:22:06.483 --> 01:22:08.813
MATT: The rest of the group's just--

01:22:08.813 --> 01:22:09.943
TALIESIN: Eh, you know what, step further,

01:22:09.943 --> 01:22:11.486
this might piss off the flesh.

01:22:12.953 --> 01:22:15.493
MATT: A step further and it may not be in range.

01:22:15.493 --> 01:22:17.126
TALIESIN: Towards the other side of the room, yeah.

01:22:17.126 --> 01:22:20.343
I mean, straight towards me, yeah.

01:22:20.343 --> 01:22:22.653
MATT: Okay, there you go.

01:22:22.653 --> 01:22:26.265
Beau, where are you headed?
MARISHA: I'll stand back.

01:22:26.265 --> 01:22:29.376
MATT: Okay, Jester? Oh, you are an ape.

01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:31.873
Okay, what are you going to try?

01:22:31.873 --> 01:22:35.413
TALIESIN: Casting Blight at 5th-level.

01:22:35.413 --> 01:22:37.416
MATT: Ooh! Roll some damage.

01:22:38.763 --> 01:22:42.083
TALIESIN: It doesn't get to make a save, does it?

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.986
MATT: It does.
TALIESIN: Okay, constitution save.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:47.576
MATT: Rolled super low.

01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:52.163
No, that's like a 15, yeah.

01:22:52.163 --> 01:22:54.833
Even with its crazy bonuses for being Cognouza.

01:22:54.833 --> 01:22:57.485
LAURA: For being a city.
MATT: For being a city.

01:22:57.485 --> 01:22:58.570
ASHLEY: For being a city.

01:23:02.733 --> 01:23:04.813
TALIESIN: 31 points of necrotic damage.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.423
MATT: Okay.

01:23:06.423 --> 01:23:10.103
The elements of the ceiling that were reaching

01:23:10.103 --> 01:23:12.493
for the stone and all the tendrils that are wrapped

01:23:12.493 --> 01:23:14.813
around the stone, even though Yasha, you were carving

01:23:14.813 --> 01:23:16.303
a couple away for a brief moment,

01:23:16.303 --> 01:23:18.286
you saw more emerge from behind it.

01:23:19.246 --> 01:23:20.446
TALIESIN: Shit roll.

01:23:20.446 --> 01:23:22.518
MATT: You get the sense this isn't going to run out of

01:23:22.518 --> 01:23:24.193
matter to throw in the direction

01:23:24.193 --> 01:23:26.586
of retrieving this stone in its proximity,

01:23:27.623 --> 01:23:30.193
but the necrotic damage that you deal causes that flesh

01:23:30.193 --> 01:23:33.236
all at once to blacken and curl backward.

01:23:34.193 --> 01:23:36.383
If it could make a sound, you could almost imagine

01:23:36.383 --> 01:23:39.623
a high-pitched screech as that portion of the ceiling

01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:44.093
goes from an extension into a withdrawing entity

01:23:44.093 --> 01:23:48.363
that feels horrible pain as black, ruined, necrotic flesh

01:23:48.363 --> 01:23:52.173
drops from the ceiling leaving about a five-foot gap

01:23:52.173 --> 01:23:54.163
from the top of where it was

01:23:54.163 --> 01:23:55.493
into where the stone currently is.

01:23:55.493 --> 01:23:58.018
LIAM: I speak the words, <i>einen Moment.</i>

01:23:58.018 --> 01:23:59.243
MATT: (whooshing) (impact)

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.433
SAM: Oh god!

01:24:00.433 --> 01:24:01.266
MATT: It drops from the ceiling,

01:24:01.266 --> 01:24:03.200
impacts the sigil on the floor.
SAM: Ow, my foot!

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.953
(laughter)

01:24:04.953 --> 01:24:05.847
TRAVIS: Does it crack at all,

01:24:05.847 --> 01:24:07.893
or does it stay in one piece from the--

01:24:07.893 --> 01:24:09.810
MATT: It stays in one piece, from what you can tell.

01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:10.653
You'd have to give it a heavier inspection

01:24:10.653 --> 01:24:12.743
to see if there's any damage.
LAURA: I run over and grab it

01:24:12.743 --> 01:24:16.634
so that the ground can't scoop it back up.

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:18.846
MATT: Okay. You pick it up.

01:24:19.783 --> 01:24:22.173
LAURA: I put Yasha down.
ASHLEY: I'm still holding onto you.

01:24:22.173 --> 01:24:23.213
LAURA: Okay, yeah, hold onto me,

01:24:23.213 --> 01:24:24.813
I'm just going to hold this stone, too.

01:24:24.813 --> 01:24:27.513
LIAM: For one minute, and then it's locked in place again.

01:24:28.733 --> 01:24:29.943
SAM: Wait, what?

01:24:29.943 --> 01:24:32.653
LIAM: So I spoke a password that lets it be moved

01:24:32.653 --> 01:24:34.988
for one minute, and then it locks where it is.

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:38.356
LAURA: I'm going to run it up to outside of this chamber

01:24:38.356 --> 01:24:40.063
and put it in the hallway.
LIAM: Baller.

01:24:40.063 --> 01:24:41.573
MATT: Okay.

01:24:41.573 --> 01:24:43.953
Right as you get there, you almost reach the point

01:24:43.953 --> 01:24:46.483
you're intending to, but then it stops in place

01:24:46.483 --> 01:24:47.343
and catches you there,

01:24:47.343 --> 01:24:48.943
but it's functional where it is.

01:24:50.543 --> 01:24:53.186
LIAM: Okay, so maybe 55 minutes or so.

01:24:54.483 --> 01:24:58.383
TRAVIS: We killed Cree and what became of Cree.

01:24:58.383 --> 01:25:01.833
Who knows where Lucien might be, but for the moment

01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:03.643
we could take up defensive positions here

01:25:03.643 --> 01:25:05.726
if we wanted to rest.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:06.867
TALIESIN: Maybe not here.

01:25:06.867 --> 01:25:09.103
This seems like the obvious place to find us.

01:25:10.323 --> 01:25:12.183
MARISHA: I think he can find us wherever we go.

01:25:12.183 --> 01:25:15.543
TALIESIN: I don't think he can. Well--

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:17.453
TRAVIS: Have you heard anything, the two of you?

01:25:17.453 --> 01:25:18.833
Have you picked up anything else?

01:25:18.833 --> 01:25:21.133
MARISHA: Yeah. When he was--

01:25:21.133 --> 01:25:23.694
LIAM: When I heard all the screaming from back by you guys.

01:25:23.694 --> 01:25:25.793
MARISHA: That was Cree.

01:25:25.793 --> 01:25:29.016
She reached out telepathically

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:33.463
and was asking for the Nonagon's help,

01:25:33.463 --> 01:25:35.006
and then he said something.

01:25:37.103 --> 01:25:39.643
He wasn't ready, he needed more time,

01:25:39.643 --> 01:25:42.946
and that she would be a "vessel of the pattern."

01:25:43.903 --> 01:25:45.261
So I'm assuming that weird, fractal glitch essence

01:25:45.261 --> 01:25:49.433
So I'm assuming that weird, fractal glitch essence

01:25:49.433 --> 01:25:54.433
that was around her, it reminded me of the tome, right?

01:25:54.861 --> 01:25:56.623
It reminded me of the tome.

01:25:56.623 --> 01:25:59.203
LIAM: What hypnotized us.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:59.203 --> 01:26:01.233
TRAVIS: We catch up Jester and Caleb on what we saw

01:26:01.233 --> 01:26:02.931
when Cree changed into the other form.

01:26:02.931 --> 01:26:04.783
LAURA: Should I check myself for eyes?

01:26:04.783 --> 01:26:05.776
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:26:06.903 --> 01:26:08.453
TRAVIS: You're an ape, right?

01:26:08.453 --> 01:26:09.534
LAURA: Oh.

01:26:09.534 --> 01:26:12.503
(ape noises)

01:26:12.503 --> 01:26:15.213
SAM: Wait, it's trying to tell us something!

01:26:15.213 --> 01:26:17.063
LAURA: I'll drop Polymorph.
MATT: Okay.

01:26:17.063 --> 01:26:18.416
LIAM: Yes, we have no bananas.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:22.533
TRAVIS: Is it 10 minutes?
LAURA: No, it's an hour.

01:26:22.533 --> 01:26:24.773
I could stay an ape for a long time, but...

01:26:26.298 --> 01:26:30.817
Huh? (confused noises)

01:26:30.817 --> 01:26:32.263
Do I have any eyes?
MATT: You don't see any eyes, no.

01:26:32.263 --> 01:26:33.463
LAURA: Sweet.

01:26:33.463 --> 01:26:35.396
SAM: What were some of the powers that you guys have?

01:26:35.396 --> 01:26:40.196
Truesight and telepathy.
LIAM: Darkvision and sending

01:26:40.196 --> 01:26:41.537
telepathic messages.

01:26:41.537 --> 01:26:43.873
SAM: Okay, I'm going to try to send a message

01:26:43.873 --> 01:26:45.466
to everybody else.

01:26:46.963 --> 01:26:48.893
Woodchuck to gray squirrel.

01:26:48.893 --> 01:26:51.483
Come in, gray squirrel. Woodchuck here.

01:26:51.483 --> 01:26:54.063
MATT: Those of you with eyes hear Veth's voice.

01:26:54.063 --> 01:26:56.783
TRAVIS: Oh my god!
TALIESIN: Well, that's unpleasant.

01:26:56.783 --> 01:26:57.934
LIAM: But.

01:26:57.934 --> 01:26:59.753
SAM: Yasha, you heard it, too, right?

01:26:59.753 --> 01:27:00.733
LIAM: Did Jester hear it? You didn't hear it.

01:27:00.733 --> 01:27:02.150
SAM: Because we have a super psychic connection?

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:05.363
ASHLEY: I didn't. I think it's just
the flesh is loud in here.

01:27:05.363 --> 01:27:07.903
I don't know, I didn't hear.
SAM: Maybe this blocks it.

01:27:07.903 --> 01:27:10.070
ASHLEY: It could.
SAM: Oh no.

01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:12.373
LAURA: Caleb, should you put the stone

01:27:12.373 --> 01:27:13.916
inside the amber hold for now?

01:27:13.916 --> 01:27:15.653
LIAM: I can do that; that will take 20 minutes.

01:27:15.653 --> 01:27:17.726
I know we wanted to try to rest up a bit.

01:27:17.726 --> 01:27:21.363
LAURA: I just, in case Lucien pops in, if Cree was calling

01:27:21.363 --> 01:27:23.423
for him or something, then I feel like we should hide

01:27:23.423 --> 01:27:25.205
the stone so he can't get it right away.

01:27:25.205 --> 01:27:27.043
TRAVIS: If he thinks he's almost done,

01:27:27.043 --> 01:27:28.973
and he completes whatever he needs to finish,

01:27:28.973 --> 01:27:31.449
and it doesn't work, he's coming here.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:27:31.449 --> 01:27:34.963
TALIESIN: Would it be insane to
Plane Shift this thing away?

01:27:34.963 --> 01:27:39.433
LAURA: I mean, I have Plane Shift,
but I can only use it once.

01:27:39.433 --> 01:27:41.503
TALIESIN: A day.
LAURA: I mean--

01:27:41.503 --> 01:27:44.366
TRAVIS: Oh, and you were planning on using it for us?

01:27:44.366 --> 01:27:46.653
SAM: To get out of here.
TALIESIN: I mean, I guess I could try

01:27:46.653 --> 01:27:50.903
to Plane Shift. Let me see.

01:27:50.903 --> 01:27:52.413
ASHLEY: Do you have it, too?
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have it.

01:27:52.413 --> 01:27:54.363
LAURA: I have it prepared, yeah.

01:27:54.363 --> 01:27:59.013
LIAM: I know we want to try to
really rest, if we can, somewhere,

01:27:59.013 --> 01:28:03.223
so presumably you could restore your reserves if we did.

01:28:03.223 --> 01:28:06.880
TALIESIN: Going to have to, we are broken.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.946
MATT: "I'm hurting quite a bit myself."
LAURA: Hey, Arty?

01:28:08.946 --> 01:28:11.087
I have a question.

01:28:11.087 --> 01:28:13.802
MATT: And the crimson weasel emerges.

01:28:13.802 --> 01:28:15.963
(squeaks)
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:28:15.963 --> 01:28:17.163
LAURA: You know how you were telling me

01:28:17.163 --> 01:28:22.110
how time is different in the fey realm?

01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:24.763
MATT: (chitters)

01:28:24.763 --> 01:28:26.789
LAURA: What if we Plane Shift there?

01:28:26.789 --> 01:28:29.447
MATT: (chitters)

01:28:31.316 --> 01:28:33.253
It's just a weasel.

01:28:33.253 --> 01:28:34.986
And in a moment, the weasel goes,

01:28:36.633 --> 01:28:39.016
like it ate something weird, and all of a sudden,

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.603
"Terribly sorry about that, I was concentrating elsewhere.

01:28:42.603 --> 01:28:44.863
"I had to come and inhabit the weasel.

01:28:44.863 --> 01:28:47.467
"I heard you say something, what were you doing?"

01:28:47.467 --> 01:28:49.303
MARISHA: Inhabit the weasel!
LAURA: The time.

01:28:49.303 --> 01:28:52.213
You said time is weird in the fey realm, right?

01:28:52.213 --> 01:28:54.403
MATT: "Yes, time is strange all over,

01:28:54.403 --> 01:28:56.480
"but definitely in the fey realm, yes."

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.653
LAURA: What if, could you,

01:28:58.653 --> 01:28:59.796
could we go there?

01:29:01.363 --> 01:29:03.913
Could you pop us in there? Could we get some sleep?

01:29:05.324 --> 01:29:07.723
MATT: "I imagine we could."

01:29:07.723 --> 01:29:08.556
LAURA: If we did,

01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:12.363
would we be able to come back

01:29:12.363 --> 01:29:13.886
without a lot of time passing?

01:29:15.703 --> 01:29:18.303
MATT: "I've done it before, but I'm a bit scattered

01:29:18.303 --> 01:29:21.073
"in my power at the moment between a few...

01:29:23.833 --> 01:29:28.529
"I can try, but I can't guarantee it. I'm...

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:29.362
"I can try, but I can't guarantee it. I'm...

01:29:31.303 --> 01:29:33.223
"Well, I've--"
TRAVIS: Crazy good idea.

01:29:33.223 --> 01:29:36.163
MATT: "Since I've begun gifting

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:40.343
"my abilities and my wondrous blessings upon others,

01:29:40.343 --> 01:29:42.620
"I've been a bit diluted."

01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:44.443
LAURA: Right.
MATT: "But I can give it a shot."

01:29:44.443 --> 01:29:47.873
LAURA: Would we be able to get back here if we needed to?

01:29:47.873 --> 01:29:51.683
MATT: "Back here, I don't know. This place is strange.

01:29:51.683 --> 01:29:52.703
"At the very least, you could probably make it

01:29:52.703 --> 01:29:55.093
"back to the Astral Sea."

01:29:55.093 --> 01:29:56.075
LAURA: Okay.

01:29:56.075 --> 01:29:58.285
MATT: Do you need an object to ground it?

01:29:58.285 --> 01:29:59.673
MARISHA: Yeah, like a tuning fork?

01:29:59.673 --> 01:30:02.523
LAURA: I don't know, do you need the same sort of things?

01:30:02.523 --> 01:30:04.843
MATT: "I imagine so, something attuned to it, yes."

01:30:04.843 --> 01:30:05.953
LAURA: Oh.

01:30:05.953 --> 01:30:08.893
SAM: Wait, so if we went, you're talking about taking

01:30:08.893 --> 01:30:11.035
us all there now?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:30:11.035 --> 01:30:13.133
MARISHA: Do you still have that tuning fork

01:30:13.133 --> 01:30:14.637
that you grabbed from the portal?

01:30:14.637 --> 01:30:16.135
MATT: You didn't grab it, you grabbed the lever instead.

01:30:16.135 --> 01:30:18.899
MARISHA: You grabbed the lever, that's right.

01:30:20.733 --> 01:30:21.933
MATT: That would have been
exactly what you would have needed.

01:30:21.933 --> 01:30:25.718
LIAM: And there's none here, since it's a similar gate?

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.316
MATT: You have no idea.

01:30:29.316 --> 01:30:32.366
You've seen nothing like that, and it's like a piece of it,

01:30:32.366 --> 01:30:37.228
it's a specific object that is attuned to this plane.

01:30:37.228 --> 01:30:38.393
TRAVIS: But you're right on, I mean,

01:30:38.393 --> 01:30:41.583
we have the piece of the circuit that he needs.

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:44.582
At the very least, if it leaves, that's it.

01:30:44.582 --> 01:30:46.023
LAURA: Yeah, if we take the threshold crest,

01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:48.013
he can't bring the city back.

01:30:48.013 --> 01:30:49.763
SAM: We hope.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:30:49.763 --> 01:30:51.513
TALIESIN: At least it's going to slow him down a little bit.

01:30:51.513 --> 01:30:52.423
MARISHA: It'll slow him down.

01:30:52.423 --> 01:30:57.003
I have a feeling whatever he is not ready for,

01:30:57.003 --> 01:30:59.683
whatever he's doing, it's some sort of assimilation

01:30:59.683 --> 01:31:02.333
into being a Nonagon, I think he's--

01:31:03.693 --> 01:31:04.843
TRAVIS: How long do you need?

01:31:06.113 --> 01:31:08.031
LAURA: For what?
TRAVIS: Plane Shift.

01:31:08.031 --> 01:31:11.589
LAURA: I mean, it's instant.

01:31:11.589 --> 01:31:13.780
TALIESIN: You or me?

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:16.833
LAURA: Would we just Plane Shift back?

01:31:16.833 --> 01:31:19.213
We would just go home, then?
TRAVIS: Who says we come back?

01:31:19.213 --> 01:31:21.243
We can try, but if we can't,

01:31:21.243 --> 01:31:22.713
this thing is floating in the Astral Sea.

01:31:22.713 --> 01:31:24.223
LAURA: I have the tuning fork.

01:31:24.223 --> 01:31:26.263
TALIESIN: Just to go home, not to come back.

01:31:26.263 --> 01:31:27.723
LIAM: If we leave, though,

01:31:28.713 --> 01:31:30.870
we'd have to find Lucien all over again.

01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:33.693
He isn't going to stop, he's going to do it again.

01:31:33.693 --> 01:31:36.973
MARISHA: Be reborn. Is that what you think?

01:31:36.973 --> 01:31:37.806
TALIESIN: Just the stone.

01:31:37.806 --> 01:31:39.668
We just throw the stone into the--
LAURA: We just send the stone?

01:31:39.668 --> 01:31:40.720
LIAM: Yes.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.646
And we stay behind, clean up this mess.

01:31:44.646 --> 01:31:49.038
MATT: Essek is currently breathing heavy.

01:31:49.038 --> 01:31:50.458
Essek's pretty hurt, goes,

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:56.536
"We mentioned time being strange in places, yes?

01:31:58.843 --> 01:32:02.543
"We've dabbled a bit in strange time.

01:32:02.543 --> 01:32:03.793
"Isn't that right, Caleb?"
LIAM: Well.

01:32:06.630 --> 01:32:08.323
In little dribs and drabs,

01:32:08.323 --> 01:32:13.190
and we've just found a very
interesting lead, but that's not quite as--

01:32:14.313 --> 01:32:17.705
What are you thinking?

01:32:17.705 --> 01:32:19.773
LAURA: Can you freeze time?
MARISHA: Are you suggesting

01:32:19.773 --> 01:32:23.373
you experiment with some untested dunamancy shit

01:32:23.373 --> 01:32:25.393
that hasn't seen the light of day for 2,000 years?

01:32:25.393 --> 01:32:26.463
Is that what you're suggesting?

01:32:26.463 --> 01:32:27.296
LAURA: So we can sleep?

01:32:27.296 --> 01:32:30.261
MATT: "That is precisely what I went into studying for,

01:32:30.261 --> 01:32:33.303
"to be honest, but there was

01:32:33.303 --> 01:32:35.903
"a device in Aeor

01:32:35.903 --> 01:32:39.013
"that we had come across that you had utilized."

01:32:39.013 --> 01:32:41.370
MARISHA: The Happy Fun Ball?
LAURA: That's right!

01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:42.266
TRAVIS: Oh.
MARISHA: Oh.

01:32:43.363 --> 01:32:45.213
TRAVIS: Wait.
LIAM: The lead-lined chamber.

01:32:45.213 --> 01:32:47.363
MARISHA: Yeah, the tubes?
MATT: Right.

01:32:47.363 --> 01:32:50.194
TRAVIS: Oh, the regeneration capsule!

01:32:51.073 --> 01:32:54.055
MATT: "Do we still have that piece?"

01:32:54.055 --> 01:32:56.638
LIAM: Yeah, yes. Ping.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

01:33:00.485 --> 01:33:01.983
MATT: "It's worth a shot, but if we would be able

01:33:01.983 --> 01:33:06.033
"to reenact that skip

01:33:06.033 --> 01:33:08.988
"in time forward."

01:33:08.988 --> 01:33:10.096
LAURA: In, like, a bubble?

01:33:11.163 --> 01:33:13.363
Could you put up the dome and we use the--

01:33:14.963 --> 01:33:16.053
Is that stupid?
TALIESIN: No.

01:33:16.053 --> 01:33:17.789
LAURA: I don't know how this shit works.

01:33:17.789 --> 01:33:19.743
TRAVIS: Are you talking about the
individual capsule we were in

01:33:19.743 --> 01:33:21.413
or a room that we could all be in?

01:33:21.413 --> 01:33:22.793
LAURA: Yeah, if we could put up the dome

01:33:22.793 --> 01:33:24.253
and make it work like the tube.

01:33:24.253 --> 01:33:26.333
MATT: "It was designed for...

01:33:26.333 --> 01:33:29.443
"What we had seen was designed for a specific individual,

01:33:29.443 --> 01:33:30.686
"for repeated uses.

01:33:32.453 --> 01:33:36.046
"We managed to acquire, mine from it,

01:33:37.303 --> 01:33:40.546
"this source, this dunamantic source crystal.

01:33:41.383 --> 01:33:45.373
"I do not believe it would survive such a--

01:33:46.783 --> 01:33:50.493
"What is the term in Common? Overclocking?"

01:33:50.493 --> 01:33:52.963
LAURA: So it would be enough for one time, all of us

01:33:52.963 --> 01:33:55.633
get a good restoration.
MATT: "If it works."

01:33:55.633 --> 01:33:59.956
LIAM: If we what? Crush it inside of the dome?

01:34:00.873 --> 01:34:02.683
MATT: "At least focus what powers

01:34:02.683 --> 01:34:05.943
"I have left and you have to give into it together."

01:34:05.943 --> 01:34:08.383
MARISHA: Be fully restored in a matter of minutes?

01:34:08.383 --> 01:34:09.817
MATT: "Seconds, if it's successful."

01:34:09.817 --> 01:34:11.483
LAURA: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: Wow.

01:34:11.483 --> 01:34:14.233
MATT: "Or it could destroy and unravel time entirely

01:34:14.233 --> 01:34:16.273
"in ways that we have not seen."

01:34:16.273 --> 01:34:18.493
MARISHA: Well.
TALIESIN: Considering where we are.

01:34:18.493 --> 01:34:20.843
MARISHA: Exactly, we're in the middle of the Astral Sea.

01:34:20.843 --> 01:34:22.826
But to that point, though,

01:34:24.183 --> 01:34:25.893
everything here is a fractal,

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:30.893
everything from the tome to the city to

01:34:31.596 --> 01:34:35.621
nine bodies inside of nine Somnovem.

01:34:35.621 --> 01:34:37.433
Everything is a fractal, so...

01:34:41.293 --> 01:34:42.603
What does that do?

01:34:42.603 --> 01:34:44.833
What does that do if you start messing with time

01:34:44.833 --> 01:34:46.223
in a place where...

01:34:47.144 --> 01:34:49.043
LAURA: Lucien is coming, Lucien is coming!

01:34:49.043 --> 01:34:50.817
Whatever we decide, we have to do it quickly,

01:34:50.817 --> 01:34:52.543
because we have to get rid of this threshold crest!

01:34:52.543 --> 01:34:54.846
TRAVIS: The threshold crest: The fire plane?

01:34:54.846 --> 01:34:56.473
LAURA: We got to do that now!

01:34:56.473 --> 01:34:59.173
LIAM: Stop him, no matter what, if we die, it's gone.

01:34:59.173 --> 01:35:01.200
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.110
LAURA: I'm holding it.

01:35:02.110 --> 01:35:03.059
TALIESIN: I assume you're pretty--

01:35:03.059 --> 01:35:05.563
Put it down, I would imagine.

01:35:05.563 --> 01:35:07.363
LAURA: Where are you sending it?
TALIESIN: Home.

01:35:08.323 --> 01:35:10.602
TRAVIS: Home where?
TALIESIN: Our plane of existence.

01:35:10.602 --> 01:35:12.363
LAURA: Don't we have that thing attuned to the fire plane?

01:35:12.363 --> 01:35:13.631
Maybe we should send it to that location.

01:35:13.631 --> 01:35:14.647
TALIESIN: Do we have a fire plane attuned--

01:35:14.647 --> 01:35:16.413
LIAM: We do, that we took from Yussa's tower.

01:35:16.413 --> 01:35:18.748
TALIESIN: I'll take that.
TRAVIS: Yeah, lava, you know,

01:35:18.748 --> 01:35:21.807
burning rock or overwatching fire demon, whatever.

01:35:21.807 --> 01:35:22.983
SAM: But we're not going to leave, right?

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:23.830
LAURA: No.
SAM: Okay.

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:26.157
TALIESIN: Are we all in agreement?
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: Yes.

01:35:26.157 --> 01:35:29.107
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the tuning fork

01:35:29.107 --> 01:35:32.498
and I'm going to send that piece of rock to the fire plane.

01:35:32.498 --> 01:35:35.603
MATT: You see it still affixed in the middle of the air,

01:35:35.603 --> 01:35:37.723
the dunamantic energies that currently hold it in place

01:35:37.723 --> 01:35:40.843
occasionally flickering around it

01:35:40.843 --> 01:35:44.053
like this translucent field of purple gray energy

01:35:44.053 --> 01:35:47.993
that occasionally flashes, and as Caduceus strikes

01:35:47.993 --> 01:35:50.243
the fork upon it and it begins to vibrate,

01:35:50.243 --> 01:35:52.823
you see that shield begin to turn orange,

01:35:52.823 --> 01:35:55.613
brighter and brighter, like it becomes luminescent,

01:35:55.613 --> 01:35:57.793
like it is heated to a bright, orange red,

01:35:57.793 --> 01:36:01.693
iron-like coloration before it
(whooshes) is gone.

01:36:01.693 --> 01:36:03.042
LIAM: Get wrecked, Nonagon.

01:36:03.042 --> 01:36:06.063
TALIESIN: (snapping) Here you go.

01:36:06.063 --> 01:36:07.171
I'm going to sit down now.

01:36:07.171 --> 01:36:08.229
TRAVIS: Great, great idea.

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:09.863
LIAM: That's one problem solved.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:36:09.863 --> 01:36:11.313
TRAVIS: Great idea.
LAURA: So whatever happens now,

01:36:11.313 --> 01:36:13.663
he can't bring the city home.
SAM: So we win. We won.

01:36:13.663 --> 01:36:14.513
LAURA: We won, now we just have to--

01:36:14.513 --> 01:36:15.946
TALIESIN: No.
LIAM: For today.

01:36:15.946 --> 01:36:17.490
MATT: "Until he finds another."

01:36:17.490 --> 01:36:18.653
MARISHA: Exactly, he can always go back

01:36:18.653 --> 01:36:19.953
and get more threshold crests.

01:36:19.953 --> 01:36:21.470
TALIESIN: He may know that there's one here.

01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:22.303
LAURA: But still, that gives us some time.

01:36:22.303 --> 01:36:23.183
MARISHA: But for today, it gives us time.

01:36:23.183 --> 01:36:24.066
SAM: If he goes back to find more,

01:36:24.066 --> 01:36:27.142
we just find the other one here and get that one.

01:36:27.142 --> 01:36:29.425
MARISHA: I don't think he's going to go back anytime soon.
TALIESIN: There might be more here.

01:36:29.425 --> 01:36:31.180
He needed a few to get here.

01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.513
LAURA and MARISHA: He needed two.

01:36:32.513 --> 01:36:34.043
TALIESIN: There might already be a bunch here

01:36:34.043 --> 01:36:36.073
that we don't know about.
LAURA: (groans)

01:36:36.073 --> 01:36:37.603
TALIESIN: Let's just assume he's got a plan B.

01:36:37.603 --> 01:36:40.536
LIAM: Yeah, he's here now with us.
We finish this properly now.

01:36:40.536 --> 01:36:44.256
LAURA: Then we fake rest and we go find him.

01:36:45.213 --> 01:36:47.113
TALIESIN: Let's get out of this room, I think.

01:36:48.173 --> 01:36:49.653
TRAVIS: Do we take our rest back at Aeor,

01:36:49.653 --> 01:36:52.073
meaning we use your Plane Shift to go back?

01:36:52.073 --> 01:36:54.083
LAURA: No, because then we can't get back.

01:36:54.083 --> 01:36:55.745
We're not going to Plane Shift to Aeor,

01:36:55.745 --> 01:36:58.850
we're going to Plane Shift to Exandria.

01:36:59.863 --> 01:37:01.216
TALIESIN: We need to--

01:37:01.216 --> 01:37:03.363
TRAVIS: I think the regeneration capsule

01:37:03.363 --> 01:37:05.836
that Essek was talking about is in Aeor, right?

01:37:05.836 --> 01:37:07.401
MARISHA: No, he's saying recreate it here.

01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:09.603
LIAM: We're talking about jury rigging the dome.

01:37:09.603 --> 01:37:11.833
MARISHA: Yes, yeah.
TRAVIS: I understand, okay, sorry.

01:37:11.833 --> 01:37:14.203
MATT: "We robbed one crystal from one of the devices there

01:37:14.203 --> 01:37:16.723
"and took it with us."
TRAVIS: I remember, okay, great,

01:37:16.723 --> 01:37:18.351
cool, good.
TALIESIN: I say it's worth a shot.

01:37:18.351 --> 01:37:19.597
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Let's do it.

01:37:19.597 --> 01:37:21.863
I mean, what other room are we going to?

01:37:21.863 --> 01:37:24.343
Not that flesh tunnel, right?
TALIESIN: Fair point.

01:37:24.343 --> 01:37:27.313
LAURA: If anything, we would go up into one of the houses.

01:37:27.313 --> 01:37:29.453
SAM: That are also alive.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:29.453 --> 01:37:32.193
LIAM: We also, we're close to that hallway that said,

01:37:32.193 --> 01:37:34.893
"Help help help." Don't forget that Yussa is here somewhere.

01:37:34.893 --> 01:37:36.833
LAURA: Then let's just do it here.
LIAM: Yes, I agree.

01:37:36.833 --> 01:37:38.763
LAURA: Take a couple seconds and go.

01:37:38.763 --> 01:37:41.189
TALIESIN: All right.
ASHLEY: But what if it does go bad?

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:44.153
What does that mean?
MARISHA: Yeah, I agree.

01:37:44.153 --> 01:37:46.213
ASHLEY: Does that just get rid of this place?

01:37:46.213 --> 01:37:48.613
Would we all just disappear, or just everything?

01:37:50.529 --> 01:37:53.643
TRAVIS: (laughs) Answer that!
MARISHA: I agree, though.

01:37:55.173 --> 01:37:57.329
MATT: "I don't know."
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:37:57.329 --> 01:37:58.926
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
TALIESIN: I'm genuinely--

01:37:58.926 --> 01:38:01.033
MATT: "That is the risk that I'm presenting here.

01:38:01.033 --> 01:38:04.806
"But we would not have achieved a lot of the great things

01:38:04.806 --> 01:38:06.403
"that we have as people through history,

01:38:06.403 --> 01:38:08.583
"let alone together as friends, if we didn't take risks."

01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:09.650
TRAVIS: Yeah!
SAM: (uncertain) Uh!

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:13.793
LIAM: This is a short term jump, relatively speaking.

01:38:13.793 --> 01:38:14.626
MATT: "Correct."
LIAM: We are not

01:38:14.626 --> 01:38:16.113
going to go back 500 years

01:38:16.113 --> 01:38:17.103
and undo all of history.

01:38:17.103 --> 01:38:19.253
ASHLEY: I don't worry about that, I just worry about,

01:38:19.253 --> 01:38:21.453
what if we just end everything?

01:38:21.453 --> 01:38:23.803
SAM: Or end us? I can't really die.

01:38:23.803 --> 01:38:25.186
MARISHA: I'm more concerned about the fact that

01:38:25.186 --> 01:38:27.813
everything here just seems to splinter off

01:38:27.813 --> 01:38:31.423
into a bajillion different pathways to an infinity,

01:38:31.423 --> 01:38:36.423
so I hope we don't all turn into dust,

01:38:37.058 --> 01:38:38.116
is all I'm saying.

01:38:38.116 --> 01:38:39.813
TALIESIN: Considering the options currently available,

01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:43.150
that actually seems like a relatively light way to go.

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:44.856
MARISHA: I thought you were a Clay.

01:38:46.292 --> 01:38:47.203
LAURA: (laughs)

01:38:47.203 --> 01:38:48.453
TALIESIN: I don't know how to put this,

01:38:48.453 --> 01:38:49.603
but we are currently on

01:38:49.603 --> 01:38:52.303
what is possibly the universe's largest cadaver.

01:38:52.303 --> 01:38:53.663
This is what I was born to do,

01:38:53.663 --> 01:38:56.308
is put this thing fucking down.

01:38:56.308 --> 01:38:57.216
Let's end this shit.

01:38:57.216 --> 01:38:58.653
LIAM: Brilliant.

01:38:58.653 --> 01:39:00.823
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:39:00.823 --> 01:39:02.382
Wow, I said a lot of words.

01:39:02.382 --> 01:39:03.793
MATT: "Including a curse word.

01:39:03.793 --> 01:39:05.373
"That's the first time I've heard you use one."

01:39:05.373 --> 01:39:08.684
TALIESIN: Me too! This place is getting to me.

01:39:08.684 --> 01:39:11.205
MATT: "I think it's getting to all of us."
ASHLEY: Veth?

01:39:11.205 --> 01:39:12.863
You're the one with the kid.

01:39:13.793 --> 01:39:15.794
SAM: Are we going to die? Are we about to die?

01:39:15.794 --> 01:39:16.694
LAURA: I don't think we're going to die,

01:39:16.694 --> 01:39:18.433
I think we're going to rest.

01:39:18.433 --> 01:39:21.563
MATT: "I don't think it would destroy us.

01:39:21.563 --> 01:39:24.463
"If things go wrong, it might take things a little strange."

01:39:25.736 --> 01:39:27.753
LAURA: Arty will protect us, don't worry.

01:39:29.613 --> 01:39:31.863
SAM: Well, I guess that's reassuring.

01:39:31.863 --> 01:39:35.781
He's been killed several times and not died.

01:39:35.781 --> 01:39:37.312
TRAVIS: (like Sprinkle) Why can't I die?

01:39:37.312 --> 01:39:39.773
(laughter)

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:40.646
SAM: All right.

01:39:40.646 --> 01:39:41.479
LIAM: It's like get this thing out of me.

01:39:41.479 --> 01:39:42.629
TRAVIS: (like Sprinkle) Leave my body!

01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:46.470
(laughter)

01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:50.653
SAM: All right, sure, let's try to get a super fast rest

01:39:50.653 --> 01:39:52.493
with science.
MATT: "Here, right now?"

01:39:52.493 --> 01:39:54.610
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:39:55.563 --> 01:39:57.973
MARISHA: I swear to god, Essek, if you fuck this up.

01:39:57.973 --> 01:39:59.243
TRAVIS: Well, you wouldn't really around

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:02.383
to do anything after that.
MARISHA: Nope, but I just--

01:40:02.383 --> 01:40:03.978
My essence will haunt you.

01:40:03.978 --> 01:40:04.882
TRAVIS: True enough.
TALIESIN: Guidance.

01:40:04.882 --> 01:40:09.288
MATT: "And I would deserve it,
like I deserve all of the things that haunt me."

01:40:09.288 --> 01:40:11.588
LAURA: Aw, Essek.

01:40:11.588 --> 01:40:14.496
MARISHA: Mood killer.
MATT: "Don't offer me any solace."

01:40:14.496 --> 01:40:15.329
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Yeah,

01:40:15.329 --> 01:40:17.683
you're a horrible person.

01:40:17.683 --> 01:40:18.823
TALIESIN: And now that we have established it,

01:40:18.823 --> 01:40:20.529
let's help save the world.

01:40:20.529 --> 01:40:21.362
LIAM: Actually,

01:40:22.454 --> 01:40:24.486
I have to do one thing very quickly.

01:40:25.553 --> 01:40:29.893
Can I have one of those residuum crystals, please?

01:40:29.893 --> 01:40:33.213
SAM: Yes, of course. The shards?
LIAM: Yes.

01:40:33.213 --> 01:40:37.873
Very quickly, I get down on the ground and I take off...

01:40:37.873 --> 01:40:41.023
I don't take it off, I hold the residuum shard

01:40:41.023 --> 01:40:44.173
in one hand, and I hold it together with the medallion

01:40:44.173 --> 01:40:46.263
that I'm wearing and I'm going to cast Fabricate

01:40:46.263 --> 01:40:50.641
and slowly melt the residuum around the necklace.

01:40:50.641 --> 01:40:53.123
and slowly melt the residuum around the necklace.

01:40:53.123 --> 01:40:55.933
MATT: Hm, okay, interesting.
SAM: What will that do?

01:40:55.933 --> 01:41:00.693
LIAM: Okay, let's do this wildly foolish risk.

01:41:00.693 --> 01:41:02.839
TALIESIN: Jester, you want Guidance on Caleb, and--

01:41:02.839 --> 01:41:05.027
LAURA: (clapping) (hand rubbing)

01:41:05.027 --> 01:41:06.781
MARISHA: All right.
MATT: "All right, gather close."

01:41:06.781 --> 01:41:08.689
ASHLEY: For science.

01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:10.172
MARISHA: Do we huddle up?
MATT: "Who has the object?"

01:41:10.172 --> 01:41:11.719
MARISHA: Do we touch each other? What do we do?

01:41:11.719 --> 01:41:12.552
LAURA: Oh.

01:41:12.552 --> 01:41:14.960
LIAM: Do we want-- Is there any--

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.453
Is there any practical reason to surround us

01:41:17.453 --> 01:41:21.103
in a dome bubble to do this, or do we think--

01:41:21.103 --> 01:41:22.933
MATT: "I think it will be fine, if we do it quickly."

01:41:22.933 --> 01:41:23.766
MATT: Okay.

01:41:24.841 --> 01:41:27.113
TRAVIS: He can dispel anything he comes across.

01:41:27.113 --> 01:41:28.293
MATT: As you all begin to gather up,

01:41:28.293 --> 01:41:31.953
he pulls out a piece of dark chalk

01:41:31.953 --> 01:41:34.113
and finds a section of the floor,

01:41:34.113 --> 01:41:37.323
and begins to draw different dunamantic symbols

01:41:37.323 --> 01:41:40.013
in this patterned array, making you

01:41:40.013 --> 01:41:41.533
progressively more and more uncomfortable

01:41:41.533 --> 01:41:43.463
as the designs begin to come together,

01:41:43.463 --> 01:41:44.913
and some of them are little more intricate

01:41:44.913 --> 01:41:47.063
for even your understanding, but you begin to pick up

01:41:47.063 --> 01:41:51.013
the basics of it, using this stone as a focus,

01:41:51.013 --> 01:41:53.783
not unlike how residuum is used as an amplifier device

01:41:53.783 --> 01:41:56.176
in, you know, a number of other laboratories.

01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:58.743
But as you all gather around,

01:41:58.743 --> 01:42:02.913
he sits and places the stone in the middle of it

01:42:02.913 --> 01:42:05.923
and then sits on one side of it and gestures

01:42:05.923 --> 01:42:08.323
for you to get on the opposite end.

01:42:08.323 --> 01:42:09.913
LIAM: Beauregard, you know,

01:42:09.913 --> 01:42:13.643
if you count Sprinkle, there are nine of us.

01:42:16.624 --> 01:42:20.857
MARISHA: What? Sprinkle?
LAURA: We are the Nonagon!

01:42:21.823 --> 01:42:24.708
TRAVIS: TWK incoming. Total world kill.

01:42:24.708 --> 01:42:26.123
MATT: Now.

01:42:26.123 --> 01:42:28.633
What's your highest currently available spell slot?

01:42:28.633 --> 01:42:31.016
LIAM: High? Oh, not that high.

01:42:32.309 --> 01:42:34.943
5th.
MATT: 5th, okay.

01:42:34.943 --> 01:42:36.181
It's going to take a roll from you and Essek,

01:42:36.181 --> 01:42:38.241
and you get to add five to that roll

01:42:38.241 --> 01:42:41.353
because that is the spell level spent on it.

01:42:41.353 --> 01:42:42.613
LAURA: Oh dang.

01:42:42.613 --> 01:42:45.121
MATT: He's dropping his 8th-level spell
that he's been saving this whole time.

01:42:45.121 --> 01:42:46.262
LAURA: We can't help?

01:42:46.262 --> 01:42:48.453
I mean, we've guided, that's all we can do.

01:42:48.453 --> 01:42:49.473
MATT: Guiding helps.

01:42:49.473 --> 01:42:51.783
LAURA: We'll add a four, a d4.

01:42:51.783 --> 01:42:55.293
LIAM: Is it adding arcana or anything,
or it's just a d20 plus--

01:42:55.293 --> 01:42:56.940
MATT: Plus the power of the spell
that you are power this with.

01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:59.843
LIAM: Got it, plus Guidance.
TRAVIS: I grab Jester's hand.

01:42:59.843 --> 01:43:00.786
SAM: Ooh!
LIAM: Rocking.

01:43:02.293 --> 01:43:04.102
MARISHA: Come on.
MATT: I'm going to roll it out front.

01:43:04.102 --> 01:43:06.370
LIAM: Rocking. Did very well.

01:43:07.373 --> 01:43:08.206
MATT: Natural 20.

01:43:08.206 --> 01:43:10.147
(cheering)

01:43:10.147 --> 01:43:12.055
LAURA: Essek!
MARISHA: Oh!

01:43:13.223 --> 01:43:14.056
MATT: Plus two.

01:43:15.223 --> 01:43:17.663
Plus eight, so that's a 30 from Essek.

01:43:17.663 --> 01:43:19.583
LIAM: Dirty 24.
MATT: Dirty 24.

01:43:19.583 --> 01:43:22.028
MARISHA: Oh, we're not going to die!
MATT: No.

01:43:22.028 --> 01:43:24.673
Combined 40 was my threshold on that.

01:43:24.673 --> 01:43:25.914
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:43:25.914 --> 01:43:27.381
MATT: Combined 40.
SAM: Combined 40?

01:43:27.381 --> 01:43:31.368
TRAVIS: Wow! Holy shit.
SAM: Whoa!

01:43:31.368 --> 01:43:33.383
MARISHA: What would've happened if not?

01:43:33.383 --> 01:43:35.459
MATT: That's in this post-campaign conversation.

01:43:35.459 --> 01:43:37.012
But for now.
TRAVIS: You don't know.

01:43:37.012 --> 01:43:39.563
MATT: For now, there's that brief moment

01:43:39.563 --> 01:43:42.670
where you see Essek, sweat beginning to form on his forehead

01:43:42.670 --> 01:43:45.253
as he's concentrating, and as you're focusing

01:43:45.253 --> 01:43:46.853
your spell energy towards this crystal,

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:49.553
you see it begin to glow brighter and brighter and brighter,

01:43:49.553 --> 01:43:52.203
not unlike the way that the threshold crest

01:43:52.203 --> 01:43:53.853
was taking on that filament-like brightness,

01:43:53.853 --> 01:43:56.833
but this itself has a deep, deep purplish hue,

01:43:56.833 --> 01:43:59.303
and you see it begin to flicker,

01:43:59.303 --> 01:44:02.103
not unlike the symbol that you were seeing,

01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:03.793
which makes you extremely uncomfortable.

01:44:03.793 --> 01:44:07.633
In a moment, you feel this urge to just rush in and stop it,

01:44:07.633 --> 01:44:10.993
but as you do, Essek twitches his arms around it

01:44:10.993 --> 01:44:13.323
and then draws his fingers in two different directions,

01:44:13.323 --> 01:44:15.673
and you see this small tear in reality,

01:44:15.673 --> 01:44:18.023
a break in reality, if you will.

01:44:18.023 --> 01:44:20.733
And with that, you can see, in a brief moment,

01:44:20.733 --> 01:44:23.173
in this sliver, hundreds of realities

01:44:23.173 --> 01:44:25.113
just brushing by at an endless speed.

01:44:25.113 --> 01:44:27.943
He begins to take and fold that tear around,

01:44:27.943 --> 01:44:31.113
like if the tear in space time became a thread,

01:44:31.113 --> 01:44:33.093
and wrap it around this stone,

01:44:33.093 --> 01:44:35.189
and as soon as it begins to close on it,

01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:37.743
(sizzling) (shattering)

01:44:37.743 --> 01:44:39.584
it shatters,

01:44:39.584 --> 01:44:40.517
and we're going to go to break.

01:44:40.517 --> 01:44:42.418
(groaning)

01:44:42.418 --> 01:44:45.708
ASHLEY: That was so [Inaudible].
LIAM: Winners!

01:44:45.708 --> 01:44:47.295
MARISHA: Amazing.
MATT: Magic's weird, y'all.

01:44:47.295 --> 01:44:48.863
MARISHA: Holy shit!
MATT: We'll come back here

01:44:48.863 --> 01:44:52.013
in a few minutes to pick that up from here.

01:44:52.013 --> 01:44:53.406
So yeah, we'll see you here in a little bit.

01:44:53.406 --> 01:44:54.926
ASHLEY: God.
TRAVIS: Woo!

01:45:02.926 --> 01:45:04.710
(NARRATOR) Descending into the dark

01:45:04.710 --> 01:45:07.890
Dungeons of forgotten memories.

01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:11.418
The mighty guardian found himself caught in an ambush

01:45:14.498 --> 01:45:16.581
an old but familiar magic

01:45:18.330 --> 01:45:20.763
whispering a call to adventure.

01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:26.910
Compelled by fate, he summoned the old fellowship.

01:45:32.650 --> 01:45:34.709
Alright, boys, what's the plan of attack here.

01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:35.542
(BOY in vest) You gotta get the key.

01:45:35.542 --> 01:45:37.144
And then we've got to go to the exit

01:45:37.144 --> 01:45:38.140
(BOY in stripped jacket) alright, take out this

01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:39.355
little spider looking thing.

01:45:39.355 --> 01:45:41.614
(GIRL) Do it Don! Take him out.

01:45:41.614 --> 01:45:42.447
(DON) Where we going?

01:45:42.447 --> 01:45:43.650
We go in here.

01:45:43.650 --> 01:45:46.270
Chest. Oh, we got a card.

01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:47.561
(BOY in vest) whoa, nice.

01:45:51.959 --> 01:45:53.365
(GIRL) Do I need to save you?

01:45:53.365 --> 01:45:54.532
(DON) A card, you got a card?

01:45:54.532 --> 01:45:56.410
(GIRL)Okay, hang on, I got this.

01:46:08.741 --> 01:46:10.379
What about this door over here?

01:46:10.379 --> 01:46:11.467
(DON) I have a feeling this will get ugly.

01:46:14.092 --> 01:46:17.800
(dramatic music)

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.147
(BOY in vest) They're killing you man.

01:46:19.749 --> 01:46:21.326
I'm about to die!

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.721
We got this clown. Come on!

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:25.942
(BOY in vest) We've got your back.

01:46:25.942 --> 01:46:26.775
(DON) Here they come.

01:46:26.775 --> 01:46:27.608
(GIRL) I got you. I got you.

01:46:27.608 --> 01:46:29.581
(BOY in vest) Let's do this.

01:46:29.581 --> 01:46:32.581
(ALL) whoa, nice!

01:46:33.508 --> 01:46:36.425
(dramatic music)

01:47:15.197 --> 01:47:16.720
(NARRATOR) This is everything you need to know

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.923
about our terrain in 60 seconds.

01:47:19.345 --> 01:47:22.230
We hand sculpt our pieces for maximum detail and

01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:25.650
artistry infusing passion into every millimeter of our work.

01:47:25.650 --> 01:47:27.750
Everything is available, beautifully hand painted

01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:30.030
so you can start playing right away or you can

01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:32.240
choose unpainted to paint everything yourself.

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.960
Our pieces are completely modular,

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.270
so you can use the same sets

01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:37.420
to create a new adventure every time.

01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:39.440
We create everything out of dwarvenite

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.210
our top secret PVC formula, that's nearly indestructible.

01:47:43.210 --> 01:47:46.360
We pack our pieces with as many features as possible, such

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.670
as swappable LEDs to quickly change the look of your scene.

01:47:49.670 --> 01:47:51.536
We offer magnetic accessories to add flavor

01:47:51.536 --> 01:47:53.440
or increase the danger.

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.590
A one inch tactical grid is sculpted into our floors.

01:47:56.590 --> 01:47:58.160
We offer a range of environments

01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.630
including Dungeons, caverns, cities, castles, sewers, forest

01:48:01.630 --> 01:48:04.310
mountain, streets, Burroughs, ice, and hell scape.

01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:06.330
And that's just the beginning.

01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:07.930
That's everything you need to know

01:48:07.930 --> 01:48:10.390
about Dwarven Forge in 60 seconds.

01:48:15.384 --> 01:48:18.384
(Dramatic Music)

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.460
I love narrative telephone

01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:05.760
because it just feels like what it feels

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.530
like to be a DM from week to week.

01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:09.150
Like, what did I say?

01:51:09.150 --> 01:51:11.140
This is my pitch for the next season for at

01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:15.060
least one episode when we can be together again in life.

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.120
Here's my pitch.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.410
We do it live, right?

01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:21.420
Someone tells a story and then like

01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:25.439
like in the next room over, someone's watching it.

01:51:25.439 --> 01:51:28.386
My pitch is to have somebody tell Ashley a story

01:51:28.386 --> 01:51:30.900
and then she tells it to camera.

01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:31.860
And then a week later

01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:33.677
she comes back and tries to tell it again.

01:51:33.677 --> 01:51:34.744
Her own story?

01:51:34.744 --> 01:51:36.610
And then she comes back a week later

01:51:36.610 --> 01:51:37.826
and tries to tell it again.

01:51:37.826 --> 01:51:39.170
That's pretty good.

01:51:39.170 --> 01:51:43.734
No, we don't need it, we have more than enough content.

01:51:43.734 --> 01:51:44.728
So much content.

01:51:44.728 --> 01:51:46.763
(MAN top right corner) It's drunk history, but it's just

01:51:46.763 --> 01:51:50.187
it's just Ashley and not drunk, just Ashley.

01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:54.040
Honestly, this might have to be the Christmas special

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:54.873
or something.

01:51:54.873 --> 01:51:56.268
No, no, stop it.

01:51:56.268 --> 01:51:57.101
Yes!

01:51:57.101 --> 01:51:59.786
Stop it. No more ideas.

01:51:59.786 --> 01:52:01.953
(music)

01:52:16.437 --> 01:52:18.540
Get up there Sam, you can do it.

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:19.870
You got this

01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:20.730
Push it

01:52:20.730 --> 01:52:21.890
Just a quick climb guys.

01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:22.723
You keep going.

01:52:24.710 --> 01:52:27.703
Is your wife home with the defibrillator if we need one?

01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:30.323
Just in case.

01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:35.750
I know you're not a young chap anymore.

01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:39.650
I just had no idea that, like, you were just going to be

01:52:39.650 --> 01:52:41.133
on your Peloton this time.

01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:44.140
I was genuinely like you were

01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:46.140
we were prepping before the episode

01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:47.330
and everybody's on camera.

01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:50.340
And I just thought you were choosing to wear like a slip.

01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:52.096
You just thought I dress like this.

01:52:52.096 --> 01:52:54.493
This is a really weird choice, Sam, but..

01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:58.387
I like we're at that part in our relationship

01:52:58.387 --> 01:53:00.200
where you're like, well

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.380
this is a mistake for him

01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:03.840
but I'm not even going to bring it up.

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:05.170
I'm just going to let him make it.

01:53:05.170 --> 01:53:06.734
It's fine.

01:53:06.734 --> 01:53:08.901
(music)

01:53:40.590 --> 01:53:42.660
Hey, critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:45.000
Let's see what's up in the critical roles shop

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.730
Roll an investigation if you want,

01:53:48.730 --> 01:53:51.083
it's basically perfect.

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:54.850
Go ahead, darling.

01:53:54.850 --> 01:53:56.053
Treat yourself.

01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.853
Check out the details on this thing.

01:54:05.275 --> 01:54:07.980
I mean the traveler always says impulse purchases

01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.203
are a good decision.

01:54:11.650 --> 01:54:13.590
This is, this is a lot of stuff you guys.

01:54:13.590 --> 01:54:16.333
We have like so many cool things right now.

01:54:17.710 --> 01:54:19.913
So click on over to the critical role shop.

01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:22.820
Don't worry. There's a few more minutes in the break.

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:23.770
You still got time.

01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:31.720
Like a symphony playing to an empty theater

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.120
critical role dines alone without its audience.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.390
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:42.930
on the other side of the fourth wall.

01:54:42.930 --> 01:54:46.600
And what is this fourth wall separating the viewer

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.740
from the creator, a portal to an often sought point

01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:53.940
of connection or the Twitch subscription zone

01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:56.590
on the rare occasion that you miss

01:54:56.590 --> 01:54:58.260
the live bacchanal boasted

01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:01.640
by the ragtag group of thespians on Thursday night.

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.890
you may always view the show on demand

01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:05.450
in the Shadowland known as

01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:08.590
the Twitch subscription zone.

01:55:08.590 --> 01:55:09.780
Picture if you will

01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:13.010
the necessary pieces to complete a jigsaw puzzle

01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:16.450
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

01:55:16.450 --> 01:55:19.930
You could of course subscribe with your debt rectangle

01:55:19.930 --> 01:55:23.060
but many more divergent paths lie before you

01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.534
perhaps you found yourself in possession

01:55:24.534 --> 01:55:27.473
of an Amazon Prime account,

01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:30.130
you would then wake up to discover

01:55:30.130 --> 01:55:32.330
a free Twitch subscription each month

01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:34.530
for a channel of your choosing.

01:55:34.530 --> 01:55:37.150
But this artifact demands renewal for you must

01:55:37.150 --> 01:55:41.342
resubscribe each month to quench it's unyielding thirst.

01:55:41.342 --> 01:55:43.780
One need not walk alone.

01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:46.350
Those who have already found their way can illuminate

01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:50.663
the path for others via the gift of sub button on Twitch.

01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:53.340
Critical role is humbled

01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:55.810
by your subscription and wishes to thank you.

01:55:55.810 --> 01:55:59.442
From behind the thin veil of this fourth wall.

01:55:59.442 --> 01:56:03.410
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:06.260
And so ends another meandering digression

01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:09.950
a complicated parody, promo down an indistinct highway

01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:13.953
to the region we call the Twitch subscription zone.

01:56:22.749 --> 01:56:24.249
You will subscribe

01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:28.480
Twitch prime subscribe,

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:30.233
gift subscribe,

01:56:32.212 --> 01:56:35.792
subscribe.

02:10:15.443 --> 02:10:17.043
MATT: And welcome back.

02:10:17.043 --> 02:10:20.223
So last we left off

02:10:20.223 --> 02:10:24.713
as the spark surrounding this small stone

02:10:24.713 --> 02:10:26.826
causes reality to briefly crack,

02:10:27.673 --> 02:10:31.693
and with a whoosh of energy,

02:10:31.693 --> 02:10:36.083
for a brief moment, there is nothing.

02:10:36.083 --> 02:10:38.418
Absence. Darkness.

02:10:40.343 --> 02:10:42.776
Everything just stops to an immediate stillness.

02:10:45.783 --> 02:10:47.766
Then there's this rush of wind,

02:10:49.813 --> 02:10:52.656
directionless, but a force, a pulling.

02:10:53.683 --> 02:10:57.383
And then your lungs hurt

02:10:58.853 --> 02:11:00.383
and you exhale.

02:11:00.383 --> 02:11:02.843
And as you do, your vision comes back from darkness.

02:11:02.843 --> 02:11:05.263
It's like you've been holding your breath forever

02:11:05.263 --> 02:11:06.866
and you all begin to cough a little bit,

02:11:06.866 --> 02:11:09.953
just instinctually from the period that you were--

02:11:09.953 --> 02:11:10.992
undetermined time.

02:11:10.992 --> 02:11:14.003
(coughing)

02:11:14.003 --> 02:11:15.903
MATT: And as you breathe in after the cough,

02:11:15.903 --> 02:11:20.273
your first breath you feel refreshed

02:11:21.583 --> 02:11:24.624
and you look around and

02:11:26.366 --> 02:11:29.208
you feel like you had
the best night's sleep of your life.

02:11:29.208 --> 02:11:30.903
TRAVIS: Say it, say it!

02:11:32.192 --> 02:11:33.141
MATT: Yeah, you get a long rest.

02:11:33.141 --> 02:11:35.253
(cheering)

02:11:35.253 --> 02:11:38.383
LIAM: I need this technology in my real life.

02:11:38.383 --> 02:11:40.008
TRAVIS: Lucien is standing outside, isn't he?

02:11:40.008 --> 02:11:40.841
No, just kidding.

02:11:40.841 --> 02:11:42.546
ASHLEY: He's right behind me, isn't he?

02:11:42.546 --> 02:11:44.633
MATT: (laughs)

02:11:44.633 --> 02:11:45.466
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:11:45.466 --> 02:11:47.492
MARISHA: ♪ Take long rest ♪
LAURA: ♪ Re-choose the spells ♪

02:11:47.492 --> 02:11:48.325
ASHLEY: Look at this.

02:11:48.325 --> 02:11:49.573
TALIESIN: Doing some spell management here.

02:11:49.573 --> 02:11:50.596
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:11:52.253 --> 02:11:54.031
TRAVIS: Oh baby.

02:11:54.031 --> 02:11:55.218
MARISHA: That might be the lowest I've gotten

02:11:55.218 --> 02:11:56.819
on ki points in a long time.

02:11:56.819 --> 02:11:57.793
TRAVIS: How many?

02:11:57.793 --> 02:11:58.823
MARISHA: Four.
SAM: 14 left.

02:11:58.823 --> 02:12:01.359
MARISHA: I had four left.
LIAM: Was down to 10.

02:12:01.359 --> 02:12:02.803
It was rough.

02:12:02.803 --> 02:12:05.311
TRAVIS: That was like Grog going,
"Yeah, I'm real hurt." 124.

02:12:05.311 --> 02:12:06.603
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yep.

02:12:06.603 --> 02:12:08.239
LIAM: Could've only stunned eight people.

02:12:08.239 --> 02:12:09.583
It was real bad.

02:12:09.583 --> 02:12:10.849
MATT: In two rounds.

02:12:10.849 --> 02:12:13.910
MARISHA: Hate feeling that weak.
MATT: Logistically, in two rounds.

02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:16.678
LIAM: (impacts)

02:12:16.678 --> 02:12:17.916
TALIESIN: Pick some spells.

02:12:19.613 --> 02:12:22.319
ASHLEY: Everything looks normal around us?

02:12:22.319 --> 02:12:23.763
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:12:23.763 --> 02:12:24.656
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:12:26.023 --> 02:12:27.423
I'll assist you.

02:12:27.423 --> 02:12:28.446
LIAM: Damn it, Ashley.

02:12:28.446 --> 02:12:29.687
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it.
SAM: Oh my god.

02:12:29.687 --> 02:12:31.663
SAM: I'm pregnant...

02:12:31.663 --> 02:12:34.021
with Caleb's baby!
ASHLEY: So that means I roll again?

02:12:34.021 --> 02:12:35.110
If you assist?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:12:35.110 --> 02:12:36.323
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:12:36.323 --> 02:12:38.143
MARISHA: What timeline is this?

02:12:38.143 --> 02:12:39.353
ASHLEY: 21.

02:12:39.353 --> 02:12:41.003
MATT: 21.

02:12:41.003 --> 02:12:42.633
Everything seems normal at the moment,

02:12:42.633 --> 02:12:47.633
though there is a strange residual effect of this.

02:12:47.683 --> 02:12:50.543
As you see the shattered gem on the ground, you all gather,

02:12:50.543 --> 02:12:52.163
and as everyone has this conversation checking

02:12:52.163 --> 02:12:53.950
like, "Everyone feel all right?"

02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:57.093
There's a weird echo.

02:12:57.093 --> 02:13:00.593
And for a moment you see

02:13:00.593 --> 02:13:03.353
Veth talking

02:13:03.353 --> 02:13:06.073
and then her words go backwards for a moment

02:13:06.073 --> 02:13:07.496
and then go forward again.

02:13:08.842 --> 02:13:11.773
TRAVIS and LIAM: (talking backwards)

02:13:13.181 --> 02:13:15.020
MATT: Essek sees your panic and goes,

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.140
"Ah, I would not worry.

02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:20.606
"That is just a residual echo of the

02:13:20.606 --> 02:13:22.520
"alteration of time

02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:24.596
"when it's unfocused, as this was.

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:27.480
"So it should wear off in just a moment.

02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:29.783
"The fact that we're here means it succeeded."

02:13:29.783 --> 02:13:31.542
TRAVIS: What's that smell?

02:13:31.542 --> 02:13:33.210
(blows raspberry)

02:13:33.210 --> 02:13:34.043
SAM: (sucking)

02:13:35.373 --> 02:13:36.609
It sucked back in!

02:13:36.609 --> 02:13:38.592
(laughter)

02:13:38.592 --> 02:13:39.734
SAM: Oh my god!

02:13:41.596 --> 02:13:42.429
LIAM: So dumb.

02:13:44.293 --> 02:13:45.793
SAM: Just a residual.
TRAVIS: That's my mind.

02:13:45.793 --> 02:13:47.513
(laughter)

02:13:47.513 --> 02:13:49.386
TRAVIS: How does it apply to farts?

02:13:52.373 --> 02:13:55.243
LIAM: Who's got that armor we found in Aeor?

02:13:55.243 --> 02:13:57.518
SAM: Oh, and also my crossbow.

02:13:57.518 --> 02:13:59.876
LIAM: Yes. Put it on the ground here.
SAM: Thank you, please.

02:14:01.614 --> 02:14:06.093
MARISHA: Yeah, also I found a bunch of this from Flesh Cree.

02:14:06.093 --> 02:14:07.373
LIAM: I didn't pay attention to any of that.

02:14:07.373 --> 02:14:08.811
So what is it?
TRAVIS: The blood vial

02:14:08.811 --> 02:14:10.549
that was around Cree's neck,

02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:11.457
the one from the little necklace.

02:14:11.457 --> 02:14:12.659
LAURA: That one's probably important.

02:14:12.659 --> 02:14:13.673
Maybe Essek can help too.
SAM: The blood vial around Cree's neck,

02:14:13.673 --> 02:14:15.493
the other blood vials that she had.

02:14:15.493 --> 02:14:17.143
MARISHA: A war pick?
MATT: "I do have Identify."

02:14:17.143 --> 02:14:18.060
LIAM: Okay, war pick.

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.915
MARISHA: And the Cape of Mountebank

02:14:19.915 --> 02:14:22.198
which we already kind of--
LIAM: The Cape of the Mountebank.

02:14:22.198 --> 02:14:23.831
LAURA: Maybe they can split,

02:14:23.831 --> 02:14:25.748
Essek and Caleb can split it up.

02:14:25.748 --> 02:14:27.121
TRAVIS: We can just split them up?
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:14:27.121 --> 02:14:29.105
It makes you bamf.

02:14:29.105 --> 02:14:30.455
LIAM: I like that one.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:14:30.455 --> 02:14:31.533
TRAVIS: Should we split up the items?

02:14:31.533 --> 02:14:33.003
Is it better if you and Essek do it together

02:14:33.003 --> 02:14:34.303
or can you do all of them?

02:14:35.293 --> 02:14:36.913
LIAM: Sure.

02:14:36.913 --> 02:14:39.013
MATT: "I've prepared it for this morning."

02:14:39.013 --> 02:14:42.803
LIAM: I'm going to take a little bit of time to do it.

02:14:42.803 --> 02:14:46.646
I'll take the armor and Cree's fun necklace.

02:14:47.603 --> 02:14:48.898
MATT: "All right."
LIAM: Start.

02:14:50.075 --> 02:14:52.463
TRAVIS: Pick a spot back up by the hallway.

02:14:52.463 --> 02:14:53.296
MATT: Keep an eye?
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:14:53.296 --> 02:14:54.129
MATT: Got it.
LAURA: Nott's weapon.

02:14:54.129 --> 02:14:55.913
SAM: Essek, will you look at this weapon?

02:14:55.913 --> 02:14:57.316
MATT: "Ah, yes, I'd be happy to."

02:14:58.413 --> 02:15:01.836
LIAM: Actually, before I do that, just because it's quicker,

02:15:03.443 --> 02:15:04.943
two minutes ago or 10 hours ago

02:15:04.943 --> 02:15:06.443
or whatever just happened ago,

02:15:07.303 --> 02:15:10.963
Caleb pulls out the-- no, he's got the medallion out

02:15:10.963 --> 02:15:14.343
from under his shirt that's now covered in residuum.

02:15:14.343 --> 02:15:16.963
And he just starts muttering for a full 30 seconds

02:15:16.963 --> 02:15:20.703
under his breath and touches it to his forehead.

02:15:20.703 --> 02:15:23.253
And I cast, at 8th-level--

02:15:23.253 --> 02:15:25.146
SAM: This is before we rested?

02:15:26.512 --> 02:15:29.423
LIAM: I messed with the medallion before,

02:15:29.423 --> 02:15:31.213
but now that we've rested and I have an 8th-level

02:15:31.213 --> 02:15:32.779
spell slot, I'm going to cast

02:15:32.779 --> 02:15:34.512
Mind Blank.

02:15:34.512 --> 02:15:35.345
MATT: Mm!

02:15:35.345 --> 02:15:38.553
LIAM: Which means no fuckery with
my mind for the next 24 hours.

02:15:38.553 --> 02:15:39.893
MATT: You got it.

02:15:39.893 --> 02:15:41.113
TRAVIS: Whoa.
MATT: Okay.

02:15:41.113 --> 02:15:43.203
LAURA: Wow.
TRAVIS: Fucking wizard spell.

02:15:43.203 --> 02:15:46.733
MATT: I'm going to go look up all the stuff that that does.

02:15:46.733 --> 02:15:48.083
LIAM: "Immune to psychic damage,

02:15:48.083 --> 02:15:49.893
"any effect that would sense its emotions

02:15:49.893 --> 02:15:50.923
"or read its thoughts,

02:15:50.923 --> 02:15:53.623
"divination spells, and the charmed condition.

02:15:53.623 --> 02:15:55.423
"The spell even foils Wish spells

02:15:55.423 --> 02:15:56.983
"and spells or effects of similar power

02:15:56.983 --> 02:15:58.533
"used to affect the target's mind

02:15:58.533 --> 02:16:00.703
"or to gain information about the target."

02:16:00.703 --> 02:16:02.050
MATT: Interesting.
LIAM: No fuckery.

02:16:02.050 --> 02:16:04.093
TRAVIS: 8th-level?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:16:04.093 --> 02:16:06.633
MATT: That's a powerful spell.
LIAM: Stay out.

02:16:06.633 --> 02:16:09.396
Trent and everybody.

02:16:09.396 --> 02:16:10.229
MATT: Okay.

02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:11.767
TRAVIS: Trent shows up out here--

02:16:13.531 --> 02:16:14.914
LAURA: Trent is the least of our worries

02:16:14.914 --> 02:16:16.039
on this plane right now.

02:16:16.039 --> 02:16:17.438
TRAVIS: I'm impressed.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:16:19.157 --> 02:16:20.268
TRAVIS: And discouraged.

02:16:20.268 --> 02:16:22.455
SAM: Trent comes riding up on Uk'otoa.
LIAM: He's been working on it for--

02:16:22.455 --> 02:16:26.173
(laughter)

02:16:26.173 --> 02:16:28.393
TRAVIS: Well, shit.

02:16:28.393 --> 02:16:29.974
MATT: "Glad you all got a rest!"

02:16:29.974 --> 02:16:32.338
(laughter)

02:16:32.338 --> 02:16:33.686
TRAVIS: Uk'otoa sounds like a horse.

02:16:33.686 --> 02:16:35.010
MARISHA: What the fuck is it with this guy?
MATT: Sea horse.

02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:36.362
TRAVIS: A sea horse.

02:16:36.362 --> 02:16:37.195
Wee!

02:16:38.463 --> 02:16:41.290
MATT: Essek hands you the crossbow and says,

02:16:41.290 --> 02:16:43.660
"This is an Aeorian Security Cannon."

02:16:44.495 --> 02:16:46.771
SAM: Oh! Okay.

02:16:46.771 --> 02:16:48.375
MARISHA: You're a mall cop now.

02:16:48.375 --> 02:16:52.102
(laughter)

02:16:52.102 --> 02:16:53.853
SAM: Aeorian Security Cannon?

02:16:53.853 --> 02:16:56.853
Does Essek know what it can do or will I find

02:16:56.853 --> 02:16:58.576
that in my equipment somewhere?

02:16:58.576 --> 02:17:01.503
MATT: You'll find it if you look
for the object, it should be there.

02:17:01.503 --> 02:17:03.267
TRAVIS: What's in those Hollister bags?

02:17:03.267 --> 02:17:07.788
(laughter)

02:17:07.788 --> 02:17:10.503
(laughter)

02:17:10.503 --> 02:17:12.590
ASHLEY: You could smell, like, three stores down.

02:17:12.590 --> 02:17:13.423
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:17:13.423 --> 02:17:14.662
(laughter)

02:17:14.662 --> 02:17:16.646
TRAVIS: Ah, my eyes!

02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:21.623
MATT: Essentially, when you do miss with an attack,

02:17:21.623 --> 02:17:26.443
you can use a reaction to activate the gravitational pull

02:17:26.443 --> 02:17:30.513
on the device and pull the actual object back to the gun

02:17:30.513 --> 02:17:32.050
to get a secondary attack.

02:17:32.050 --> 02:17:33.723
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MARISHA: Whoa, that's cool.

02:17:33.723 --> 02:17:35.453
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

02:17:35.453 --> 02:17:36.753
I'm going to look at this.

02:17:37.963 --> 02:17:42.023
MATT: The armor is Aeorian Protective Chestplate.

02:17:42.023 --> 02:17:42.973
LIAM: Okay.

02:17:42.973 --> 02:17:44.773
MATT: And you should be able to find that in there as well.

02:17:44.773 --> 02:17:48.043
LIAM: I'll look at it and give
it to a person who can use it.

02:17:48.043 --> 02:17:51.483
And then I also had Cree's vial.

02:17:51.483 --> 02:17:52.316
MARISHA: And the war pick?

02:17:52.316 --> 02:17:53.553
Do we want to do her war pick?

02:17:53.553 --> 02:17:54.928
MATT: The war pick is not magical.

02:17:54.928 --> 02:17:55.761
MARISHA: Okay.

02:17:56.933 --> 02:17:57.896
TALIESIN: Bro.

02:17:57.896 --> 02:17:59.979
(laughter)

02:18:01.953 --> 02:18:04.896
MATT: The vial you identify.

02:18:06.983 --> 02:18:11.983
One, it worked and acted as Cree's holy symbol

02:18:12.483 --> 02:18:15.036
and the focus for her spellcasting.

02:18:15.883 --> 02:18:18.403
It does contain the blood of the Nonagon.

02:18:18.403 --> 02:18:19.612
LIAM: Of the Nonagon, you said?

02:18:19.612 --> 02:18:20.637
MATT: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: The war pick?

02:18:20.637 --> 02:18:21.803
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:18:21.803 --> 02:18:23.298
MATT: The vial.
LAURA: Blood of the Nonagon.

02:18:23.298 --> 02:18:25.504
ASHLEY: Fuck yes.

02:18:25.504 --> 02:18:27.535
TRAVIS: (gulping)

02:18:27.535 --> 02:18:29.056
MARISHA: (glass shattering)

02:18:29.056 --> 02:18:29.889
TALIESIN: Shots!

02:18:31.786 --> 02:18:33.013
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

02:18:33.013 --> 02:18:37.163
TRAVIS: If only we knew how to use that in our advantage.

02:18:37.163 --> 02:18:40.963
TALIESIN: Little Clamato juice, some vodka, celery stick.

02:18:40.963 --> 02:18:42.663
ASHLEY: I'll just take a little sipsies.

02:18:42.663 --> 02:18:43.496
TALIESIN: Pepper, Tabasco sauce.

02:18:43.496 --> 02:18:44.873
MARISHA: A Bloody Cree?
TALIESIN: Bloody Cree.

02:18:44.873 --> 02:18:45.906
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:18:48.093 --> 02:18:49.006
TALIESIN: Fuck, thank you.

02:18:50.223 --> 02:18:52.723
LIAM: This armor is probably not good for me,

02:18:52.723 --> 02:18:56.126
but follows the same rules for basic chestplate?

02:18:57.181 --> 02:18:58.393
MATT: Yeah, it's considered a breastplate.

02:18:58.393 --> 02:18:59.456
LIAM: Okay, breastplate.

02:19:01.523 --> 02:19:04.023
Well, I can't use this, but

02:19:06.595 --> 02:19:09.993
it gives a boost to your overall protection

02:19:09.993 --> 02:19:12.596
and a little bit more life on a temporary basis.

02:19:14.493 --> 02:19:17.293
Can anyone else wear armor?

02:19:17.293 --> 02:19:18.401
MARISHA: Is it a heavy plate?

02:19:18.401 --> 02:19:20.173
LIAM: It's a breastplate.

02:19:20.173 --> 02:19:21.686
LAURA: Is it heavy or medium?

02:19:22.623 --> 02:19:25.183
MATT: That'd be medium, I believe.

02:19:27.203 --> 02:19:28.036
LIAM: I cannot wear it.

02:19:28.036 --> 02:19:29.893
TALIESIN: Do you have to attune to it?

02:19:29.893 --> 02:19:32.323
LIAM: It does not seem so, no.

02:19:32.323 --> 02:19:34.923
TALIESIN: I just have a breastplate plus one at the moment.

02:19:35.993 --> 02:19:37.053
LAURA: That seems like--

02:19:37.053 --> 02:19:40.003
LIAM: I mean, anyone who wants to see the official stats can

02:19:40.003 --> 02:19:43.411
add items and check Aeorian.

02:19:43.411 --> 02:19:44.402
TRAVIS: A once a day thing.

02:19:44.402 --> 02:19:45.893
LIAM: Yep.

02:19:45.893 --> 02:19:47.937
TALIESIN: Up to you, Laura.

02:19:47.937 --> 02:19:50.828
LAURA: Let me-- Breastplate. What is it?

02:19:51.673 --> 02:19:53.453
LIAM: You'll get a plus one to your AC

02:19:53.453 --> 02:19:56.674
and then a little extra HP juice once a day.

02:20:01.103 --> 02:20:04.243
LAURA: I feel like I already have the stone

02:20:04.243 --> 02:20:05.683
which gives me an HP boost.

02:20:05.683 --> 02:20:08.063
So Caduceus, if you want that.

02:20:09.873 --> 02:20:11.339
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's five temporary hit points.

02:20:11.339 --> 02:20:12.960
That's great.

02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:15.953
And my bonus actions all suck, so I'll take it.

02:20:15.953 --> 02:20:17.463
TRAVIS: Caleb and Beau,

02:20:17.463 --> 02:20:20.423
while we were trying to research and research and research,

02:20:20.423 --> 02:20:24.483
we didn't learn anything about blood magic, right?

02:20:24.483 --> 02:20:27.493
Or how to-- if we have a sample of it?
LAURA: Can I have your old breastplate?

02:20:27.493 --> 02:20:28.326
TALIESIN: Yes, you can.

02:20:28.326 --> 02:20:30.963
TRAVIS: Have a sample of it to mess with anybody?

02:20:30.963 --> 02:20:33.313
MARISHA: Do I remember anything from my readings about

02:20:34.183 --> 02:20:38.423
what I would know if we had the Nonagon's blood

02:20:38.423 --> 02:20:40.184
or anything like that, or blood magic?

02:20:40.184 --> 02:20:41.484
TRAVIS: I feel like we got this memory stick

02:20:41.484 --> 02:20:43.200
and we're like, "Cool, now what?"

02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:44.033
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:20:44.033 --> 02:20:46.891
MATT: Make a religion check.

02:20:47.959 --> 02:20:50.063
MARISHA: Religion check.

02:20:50.063 --> 02:20:52.260
Oh, I'm actually okay at that.

02:20:53.269 --> 02:20:54.327
Ooh!

02:20:54.327 --> 02:20:55.916
Ooh, that's natural 18.

02:20:56.913 --> 02:21:00.305
Plus a nine for 27.

02:21:00.305 --> 02:21:01.261
MATT: 27, okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:21:01.261 --> 02:21:03.603
LIAM: Pretty good roll.
MARISHA: It's not bad.

02:21:03.603 --> 02:21:06.113
MATT: Blood often used in rituals

02:21:06.113 --> 02:21:10.743
and older magic such as hemocraft and

02:21:10.743 --> 02:21:14.023
as a focus for a lot of religious rites.

02:21:14.023 --> 02:21:15.223
There is power in blood.

02:21:17.833 --> 02:21:20.193
As to how this could be utilized,

02:21:20.193 --> 02:21:23.073
a number of older spells that might utilize that.

02:21:23.073 --> 02:21:27.353
It also can be a channel or focus for an individual

02:21:27.353 --> 02:21:31.403
attempting any sort of divination on the individual as well.

02:21:31.403 --> 02:21:34.108
MARISHA: Right, right.

02:21:34.108 --> 02:21:36.303
So it might be helpful if we're trying to track Lucien.

02:21:36.303 --> 02:21:39.443
LIAM: Track of her bestie.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:21:39.443 --> 02:21:43.713
TRAVIS: Does anybody want to wear it?

02:21:43.713 --> 02:21:46.393
I don't know if it would prevent his blood magic

02:21:46.393 --> 02:21:49.256
from doing something to you if you're wearing his.

02:21:50.963 --> 02:21:52.800
It's a shot in the dark, I don't know.

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:54.033
TALIESIN: Put it away somewhere.

02:21:55.023 --> 02:21:55.856
TRAVIS: Shit's weird.

02:21:57.073 --> 02:21:58.583
MATT: Who took the armor, by the way?

02:21:58.583 --> 02:22:00.083
TRAVIS: I did.
MATT: Okay.

02:22:00.083 --> 02:22:01.593
So you know the ability?

02:22:01.593 --> 02:22:03.383
So, once it's activated, for the next minute,

02:22:03.383 --> 02:22:05.383
every turn you get five temporary hit points.

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:06.483
TALIESIN: Every turn?

02:22:06.483 --> 02:22:07.643
MATT: It said, "For the next minute you gain five

02:22:07.643 --> 02:22:09.246
"temporary hit points at the start of your turn."

02:22:09.246 --> 02:22:11.823
LAURA: Oh, that's great.
MATT: Mind you, they don't stack.

02:22:11.823 --> 02:22:12.913
TALIESIN: No, just so I get--

02:22:12.913 --> 02:22:15.283
MATT: But let's say you get hit,

02:22:15.283 --> 02:22:16.823
the next turn you get five back.

02:22:16.823 --> 02:22:17.973
LIAM: It keeps topping off.
LAURA: That's great,

02:22:17.973 --> 02:22:20.514
so, if you go down, it'll automatically bring you back up.

02:22:20.514 --> 02:22:22.055
MATT: Temporary hit points do not heal you.

02:22:22.055 --> 02:22:24.313
TALIESIN: Not revive you.
LAURA: Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

02:22:24.313 --> 02:22:26.763
MATT: But it is just essentially a regenerating buffer.

02:22:26.763 --> 02:22:28.943
So if you get hit every turn, you're essentially--

02:22:28.943 --> 02:22:30.280
you have a buffer of five additional

02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:31.946
hit points every turn.
LAURA: That's great.

02:22:31.946 --> 02:22:35.043
TALIESIN: If I'm unconscious, not if
I've done all my death saves,

02:22:35.043 --> 02:22:36.919
would it bring me back up or no?

02:22:36.919 --> 02:22:38.023
MATT: Temporary hit points do not revive you.

02:22:38.023 --> 02:22:40.743
TALIESIN: Okay, so even if I'm fine and just sleep--

02:22:40.743 --> 02:22:42.653
MATT: I could double check.
TALIESIN: I'd be curious.

02:22:42.653 --> 02:22:45.439
LAURA: I took his breastplate plus one that he took off.

02:22:45.439 --> 02:22:49.023
So I'm covered in lichen right now.

02:22:49.023 --> 02:22:50.773
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: That's cool.

02:22:50.773 --> 02:22:52.422
MATT: Yeah, you're rocking that Caduceus look.

02:22:52.422 --> 02:22:53.423
LAURA: Sweet, sweet.

02:22:53.423 --> 02:22:55.443
But my AC is now 20, so that's cool

02:22:55.443 --> 02:22:56.626
MATT: Cool, hell yeah.

02:22:57.483 --> 02:22:58.903
TALIESIN: Who knows what's happening to that stuff

02:22:58.903 --> 02:22:59.736
while we're here too.

02:22:59.736 --> 02:23:01.403
It's probably gotten super messed up

02:23:01.403 --> 02:23:03.353
from all the stuff it's ingesting.

02:23:03.353 --> 02:23:04.843
LAURA: It's pink.

02:23:04.843 --> 02:23:06.482
LIAM: Does this big collection of blood

02:23:06.482 --> 02:23:09.080
have names on every single sample?

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:11.123
Is this her Dexter collection?

02:23:11.123 --> 02:23:13.979
MATT: It is her Dexter collection, yeah.

02:23:13.979 --> 02:23:16.233
You see all manner of names,

02:23:16.233 --> 02:23:18.393
most of which you do not recognize.

02:23:18.393 --> 02:23:21.168
And those that you do are what you expected.

02:23:21.168 --> 02:23:22.001
LIAM: Okay.

02:23:23.563 --> 02:23:26.443
MARISHA: Does this cape have to be attuned to, probably?

02:23:30.153 --> 02:23:31.313
LIAM: I'll Identify it.

02:23:31.313 --> 02:23:33.013
I mean, I'll Identify it to learn its properties.

02:23:33.013 --> 02:23:34.288
I don't remember if it was attunable.

02:23:34.288 --> 02:23:36.593
LAURA: The cape Dimension Doors?

02:23:36.593 --> 02:23:38.553
LIAM: Yeah, once a day.
LAURA: That's great.

02:23:38.553 --> 02:23:40.812
And you can take somebody else with you?

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:42.543
MARISHA: You can wrap them up, I think.

02:23:42.543 --> 02:23:45.433
We saw her do that with Lucien.
LAURA: I feel like somebody's that fast,

02:23:45.433 --> 02:23:46.933
either you or Yasha should wear that

02:23:46.933 --> 02:23:49.463
because you guys are really mobile.

02:23:49.463 --> 02:23:50.863
MARISHA: It just depends on if it's--

02:23:50.863 --> 02:23:52.743
TALIESIN: Tuxedo Mask out.

02:23:52.743 --> 02:23:53.805
MARISHA: Oh.

02:23:53.805 --> 02:23:56.048
SAM: Attuned?
MARISHA: Attunable, yeah.

02:23:56.048 --> 02:23:57.643
If it needs to be attuned.
SAM: It should say.

02:23:57.643 --> 02:24:00.713
MARISHA: Well, I don't know how to find it.
LIAM: I'll keep ritual Identifying.

02:24:00.713 --> 02:24:02.573
MARISHA: The spelling of it is weird.

02:24:02.573 --> 02:24:04.213
SAM: M-O-N-T-E.

02:24:04.213 --> 02:24:05.788
ASHLEY: M-O-U-N-T-E.

02:24:05.788 --> 02:24:07.126
LIAM: Mounte.
SAM: Oh, really?

02:24:07.126 --> 02:24:08.893
ASHLEY: Mountebank.

02:24:08.893 --> 02:24:10.080
I found it.

02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:11.163
TALIESIN: Mountebank.

02:24:12.451 --> 02:24:13.857
LIAM: Montblanc.

02:24:13.857 --> 02:24:17.480
MATT: It does not seem to require attunement.

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:18.673
(oohing)

02:24:18.673 --> 02:24:19.506
TALIESIN: Fancy, fancy.

02:24:19.506 --> 02:24:21.113
LIAM: And speaking of attunement--
MARISHA: There it is, there it is.

02:24:21.113 --> 02:24:23.663
LIAM: -- with Mind Blank covering my brain,

02:24:23.663 --> 02:24:28.013
I'm going to unattune to the necklace

02:24:28.013 --> 02:24:30.703
and put the Luck Stone back to work.

02:24:30.703 --> 02:24:31.803
MATT: You got it.

02:24:31.803 --> 02:24:32.746
Easy enough to do.

02:24:34.662 --> 02:24:35.979
TALIESIN: Are we going to try this?

02:24:37.113 --> 02:24:40.013
MARISHA: Do we think we still need our necklaces

02:24:40.963 --> 02:24:45.923
that shield us from Mollymauk, Lucien?

02:24:45.923 --> 02:24:47.951
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yep.

02:24:47.951 --> 02:24:50.273
LAURA: I think it would be wise, but--

02:24:50.273 --> 02:24:53.963
MARISHA: I just wonder if he can just see through anybody

02:24:53.963 --> 02:24:55.513
at this place.
TRAVIS: A fair bet.

02:24:55.513 --> 02:24:56.353
Fair bet.

02:24:56.353 --> 02:24:58.793
LAURA: Maybe he can hear through you at this point

02:24:58.793 --> 02:25:02.280
or sense you, but he doesn't know exactly where you are.

02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:03.288
MARISHA: That's true.

02:25:03.288 --> 02:25:05.273
TALIESIN: He didn't warn Cree that we were coming.

02:25:05.273 --> 02:25:07.123
LAURA: That's true.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:25:07.123 --> 02:25:09.523
MARISHA: He seems really distracted, to be fair.

02:25:09.523 --> 02:25:11.173
TALIESIN: That's pretty distracted, though.

02:25:11.173 --> 02:25:14.323
SAM: Many people were brutally murdered for these things,

02:25:14.323 --> 02:25:17.993
so I would feel bad if I just took them off.

02:25:17.993 --> 02:25:19.740
MARISHA: I just miss my gloves.

02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:21.283
I had unattuned to my gloves.

02:25:21.283 --> 02:25:23.033
LIAM: I understand. Maybe things have changed here,

02:25:23.033 --> 02:25:24.783
but also we would not have been able to successfully

02:25:24.783 --> 02:25:27.780
pull off our ambush if he was watching us.

02:25:27.780 --> 02:25:28.646
TRAVIS: True.
LAURA: That's true.

02:25:28.646 --> 02:25:30.800
TRAVIS: And those other names.

02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:35.800
Mirumus, Gariel, Elatis, Luctus, they didn't see us.

02:25:36.273 --> 02:25:38.213
MARISHA: I just miss my gloves, that's all.

02:25:38.213 --> 02:25:39.583
Should I wear this cape?

02:25:39.583 --> 02:25:42.329
LIAM: Yeah, definitely.
SAM: Or Yasha, yeah.

02:25:42.329 --> 02:25:44.543
MARISHA: I'm putting on the cape.
ASHLEY: Wear the cape.

02:25:44.543 --> 02:25:46.496
LAURA: It needs to go to somebody that already can't bamf,

02:25:46.496 --> 02:25:48.046
and me and Fjord can both bamf.

02:25:48.923 --> 02:25:49.853
MARISHA: What do you think?

02:25:49.853 --> 02:25:51.323
Is it a little too flashy?

02:25:51.323 --> 02:25:52.913
TALIESIN: I like it.

02:25:52.913 --> 02:25:54.193
MARISHA: I don't normally wear red.

02:25:54.193 --> 02:25:55.553
ASHLEY: I have ideas.

02:25:55.553 --> 02:25:56.623
LAURA: Red and blue go together.

02:25:56.623 --> 02:25:58.423
They're contrasting.
MARISHA: That's true.

02:26:01.213 --> 02:26:02.046
Cool.

02:26:02.046 --> 02:26:03.533
SAM: What are your ideas?

02:26:03.533 --> 02:26:05.703
ASHLEY: Well, this is for later for the two of us.

02:26:05.703 --> 02:26:06.744
This has nothing to do with you.

02:26:06.744 --> 02:26:08.295
TRAVIS: Oh, those kind of ideas.

02:26:08.295 --> 02:26:09.770
LAURA: You're going to bone in Dimension Door?
TALIESIN: Oh!

02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:11.663
SAM: Have sex in the cape?
MARISHA: Hmm!

02:26:11.663 --> 02:26:13.163
ASHLEY: Who knows. What are we doing?

02:26:13.163 --> 02:26:14.833
(laughter)

02:26:14.833 --> 02:26:16.293
LIAM: Focus, Yasha.

02:26:16.293 --> 02:26:17.533
ASHLEY: I'm very focused.

02:26:17.533 --> 02:26:21.283
I just get really, I get a little turnt when I'm focused.

02:26:21.283 --> 02:26:25.730
TRAVIS: Okay, so no one has tried to find us.

02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:27.146
TALIESIN: Yet.
TRAVIS: Right.

02:26:27.146 --> 02:26:30.343
We could walk back up to the tip of the Esophagus Tunnel

02:26:30.343 --> 02:26:32.716
and go check out the Help Me tunnel.

02:26:32.716 --> 02:26:34.337
LAURA: Yeah, we should find out the help--
TALIESIN: I want to see the Help room.

02:26:34.337 --> 02:26:35.720
LAURA: What if Yussa's up there?

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.243
LIAM: It's either the city in general,

02:26:37.243 --> 02:26:40.859
and the terribly tormented souls of the ward

02:26:40.859 --> 02:26:42.653
or Yussa.

02:26:42.653 --> 02:26:43.486
TRAVIS: Potentially Yussa,

02:26:43.486 --> 02:26:46.095
but the other one is just us guessing, right?

02:26:46.095 --> 02:26:48.713
MARISHA: I can also meditate and see if I can find him

02:26:48.713 --> 02:26:51.703
through the city.

02:26:51.703 --> 02:26:54.668
LAURA: Oh yeah, I could probably scry on him, too.

02:26:54.668 --> 02:26:55.576
MARISHA: You might be able to.

02:26:55.576 --> 02:26:57.033
LAURA: But you should meditate first.

02:26:57.033 --> 02:26:58.783
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, it doesn't, I'll try.

02:26:58.783 --> 02:27:00.463
Give me 10 minutes.

02:27:00.463 --> 02:27:02.223
MATT: So what are you attempting?

02:27:02.223 --> 02:27:05.296
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:27:06.613 --> 02:27:09.254
I am going to go find a quiet corner.

02:27:09.254 --> 02:27:10.137
(fart sounds)

02:27:10.137 --> 02:27:14.893
I'm going to get in a very meditative

02:27:16.623 --> 02:27:19.207
monk head space.
MATT: Okay.

02:27:19.207 --> 02:27:20.757
MARISHA: Uh-huh. You know.

02:27:20.757 --> 02:27:25.023
(laughter)

02:27:25.023 --> 02:27:25.900
And.

02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:27.263
TRAVIS: I never get used to that.

02:27:27.263 --> 02:27:30.583
MARISHA: I'm going to attempt to imagine myself

02:27:31.643 --> 02:27:36.530
hearing the waves of the--

02:27:36.530 --> 02:27:37.363
TALIESIN: Flesh cave.

02:27:37.363 --> 02:27:39.963
MARISHA: -- the Nicodranas coast line

02:27:39.963 --> 02:27:43.123
and meditate on that feeling and meditate on my breath

02:27:43.123 --> 02:27:47.918
and see if I can connect to the Cognouza and find Yussa.

02:27:47.918 --> 02:27:50.263
MATT: Okay, so you're attempting to connect

02:27:50.263 --> 02:27:52.883
your consciousness with the consciousness of Cognouza,

02:27:52.883 --> 02:27:55.733
and through that network to try and locate

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:57.983
where Yussa might be?

02:27:57.983 --> 02:27:59.913
LAURA: You're trying to connect to Cognouza?

02:27:59.913 --> 02:28:02.453
MARISHA: Well, I mean, that's how I figured it would go.

02:28:02.453 --> 02:28:03.689
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

02:28:03.689 --> 02:28:05.473
MARISHA: When you say it like that,
it sounds like a terrible idea.

02:28:05.473 --> 02:28:06.623
MARISHA: Well, you've already said you're trying it.

02:28:06.623 --> 02:28:08.633
Go ahead and roll a d20.

02:28:08.633 --> 02:28:10.933
Add your wisdom modifier and add a bonus

02:28:10.933 --> 02:28:13.245
for each eye that you carry.

02:28:13.245 --> 02:28:15.693
LIAM: This is the Astral Plane: Dreams come true.

02:28:15.693 --> 02:28:16.963
MATT: This is the realm of manifestation.

02:28:16.963 --> 02:28:18.569
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.
ASHLEY: Well, plus four, right?

02:28:18.569 --> 02:28:20.879
SAM: Wait, do you have four eyes or three?
ASHLEY: She has four now?

02:28:20.879 --> 02:28:22.021
MARISHA and MATT: Three.

02:28:23.563 --> 02:28:26.096
MARISHA: Straight wisdom plus three.

02:28:28.605 --> 02:28:30.756
Okay, okay.

02:28:31.719 --> 02:28:33.866
Good thing for those bonuses.

02:28:35.183 --> 02:28:36.056
It's not bad.

02:28:37.503 --> 02:28:40.633
My wisdom modifier?
MATT: Correct.

02:28:40.633 --> 02:28:41.466
MARISHA: Okay.

02:28:41.466 --> 02:28:42.863
LAURA: What's your wisdom modifier?

02:28:42.863 --> 02:28:44.353
MARISHA: Plus four.

02:28:44.353 --> 02:28:47.183
So that's 17 total.

02:28:47.183 --> 02:28:49.236
MATT: 17 is pretty good.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:28:50.933 --> 02:28:52.863
MATT: So you listen and you concentrate

02:28:52.863 --> 02:28:54.463
on the sound of the waves

02:28:54.463 --> 02:28:57.503
(waves crashing)

02:28:57.503 --> 02:28:58.356
pulling back.

02:28:59.273 --> 02:29:01.753
And the rhythmic aspect of it seems to give way

02:29:01.753 --> 02:29:04.096
instead to the rhythmic sound of breathing.

02:29:05.762 --> 02:29:10.123
(breathing)

02:29:10.123 --> 02:29:15.123
Like the inhale and exhale of a massive living creature.

02:29:15.723 --> 02:29:17.646
And as you time your breath with that,

02:29:18.503 --> 02:29:23.063
Beau, as a concept disseminates

02:29:23.063 --> 02:29:26.503
and you feel that tickle at each location

02:29:26.503 --> 02:29:27.786
where the eyes are.

02:29:28.683 --> 02:29:31.374
And for a moment,

02:29:31.374 --> 02:29:34.493
you are connected loosely

02:29:34.493 --> 02:29:36.636
to thousands of broken minds.

02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:40.063
It's electrifying and frightening.

02:29:40.063 --> 02:29:42.704
But for a brief instant,

02:29:42.704 --> 02:29:45.537
it's like every nerve on your body

02:29:45.537 --> 02:29:49.535
begins to spark.

02:29:49.535 --> 02:29:52.908
Slightly painful, slightly interesting.

02:29:53.953 --> 02:29:57.063
But you haven't felt connected and alive like this before,

02:29:57.063 --> 02:29:59.593
and you instinctually begin to try and withdraw

02:29:59.593 --> 02:30:02.463
but you redouble your efforts and focus.

02:30:02.463 --> 02:30:05.903
And you are part of a sprawling network

02:30:05.903 --> 02:30:08.443
of broken consciousness.

02:30:08.443 --> 02:30:13.443
And you can sense oddly the city in ways,

02:30:13.483 --> 02:30:16.656
the repeated patterns, the fractals in its design.

02:30:17.853 --> 02:30:20.203
You see where the neighborhoods are copied

02:30:20.203 --> 02:30:22.173
and you can see the tunnels,

02:30:22.173 --> 02:30:24.093
massive tunnels that all seem to converge

02:30:24.093 --> 02:30:27.563
into one central place towards the center below.

02:30:27.563 --> 02:30:30.921
Where you feel the core

02:30:32.846 --> 02:30:34.654
of the Somnovem.

02:30:38.223 --> 02:30:40.314
You concentrate on Yussa.

02:30:43.042 --> 02:30:47.209
And you feel a familiar force,

02:30:47.209 --> 02:30:49.426
a brusqueness, but a gentleness.

02:30:50.963 --> 02:30:52.793
The essence of your friend.

02:30:52.793 --> 02:30:53.856
And you follow it.

02:30:54.863 --> 02:30:58.623
In that brief moment, that connection to this grid

02:30:58.623 --> 02:31:02.603
of consciousness instead becomes a singular spark,

02:31:02.603 --> 02:31:06.236
like you're being pulled along an electric line.

02:31:07.373 --> 02:31:11.216
Until suddenly you're on the surface.

02:31:12.583 --> 02:31:13.843
There's no sight involved here.

02:31:13.843 --> 02:31:14.703
You're not seeing.

02:31:14.703 --> 02:31:17.396
You're just part of the street.

02:31:18.993 --> 02:31:19.826
And for a brief moment,

02:31:19.826 --> 02:31:21.916
you want to just let it take over,

02:31:23.663 --> 02:31:27.263
to just find comfort in this.

02:31:27.263 --> 02:31:28.966
No, no, you push against it.

02:31:31.903 --> 02:31:36.046
And amongst the varying hollow bodies walking the streets,

02:31:37.373 --> 02:31:38.673
going through the motions,

02:31:40.913 --> 02:31:44.738
you see one of darker skin and light hair,

02:31:44.738 --> 02:31:45.986
an elvish complexion,

02:31:47.203 --> 02:31:49.353
wandering aimless amongst them.

02:31:51.683 --> 02:31:52.761
Maybe about

02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:57.923
a better part of a mile to the east

02:31:57.923 --> 02:31:59.933
of where you are on the surface.

02:31:59.933 --> 02:32:01.403
MARISHA: How does he look?

02:32:01.403 --> 02:32:04.653
Does he look like he's still in his own mind?

02:32:06.403 --> 02:32:07.236
MATT: It's odd.

02:32:07.236 --> 02:32:09.116
Everyone else is physically here.

02:32:09.963 --> 02:32:14.473
He is partially.
MARISHA: Right.

02:32:14.473 --> 02:32:17.473
MATT: You're not seeing him, you're just sensing.

02:32:17.473 --> 02:32:21.583
It's all through that connective tissue,

02:32:21.583 --> 02:32:24.243
and Yussa is connected to this network.

02:32:24.243 --> 02:32:25.896
But his connection is hollow.

02:32:27.051 --> 02:32:29.323
MARISHA: Right, an astral projection.

02:32:29.323 --> 02:32:32.071
I just say: Yussa.

02:32:33.890 --> 02:32:36.553
Yussa, it's the Mighty Nein, we're here.

02:32:38.203 --> 02:32:41.746
MATT: You sense Yussa's attention turn.

02:32:44.183 --> 02:32:47.583
And in that moment, you sense something bright

02:32:47.583 --> 02:32:49.723
and red coming from elsewhere.

02:32:49.723 --> 02:32:51.486
LAURA: Uh-oh.
MARISHA: I cut.

02:32:52.773 --> 02:32:53.963
MATT: Okay.

02:32:53.963 --> 02:32:54.796
You withdraw.

02:32:55.893 --> 02:32:58.673
You managed to maintain yourself through that.

02:32:58.673 --> 02:33:02.226
But maybe not enough to do so unnoticed.

02:33:03.233 --> 02:33:06.385
You traveled in the network of Cognouza's consciousness.

02:33:06.385 --> 02:33:07.751
LIAM: (whispering) Hack the planet.

02:33:08.613 --> 02:33:10.610
MATT: But something saw you.

02:33:10.610 --> 02:33:12.566
TRAVIS: (whispering) You got sliced.

02:33:12.566 --> 02:33:13.399
MARISHA: (heavy exhale)

02:33:13.399 --> 02:33:14.615
ASHLEY: (whispering) Hack to you.

02:33:16.171 --> 02:33:18.615
LIAM: This is where the two stories come together.

02:33:18.615 --> 02:33:20.223
SAM: All right, that's our plan.

02:33:20.223 --> 02:33:23.202
MATT: This is where we dovetail the two narratives finally.

02:33:23.202 --> 02:33:26.323
SAM: We've been working on this for years, guys.

02:33:27.666 --> 02:33:29.376
MATT: Me and Sam play the long game.

02:33:29.376 --> 02:33:30.613
(laughter)

02:33:30.613 --> 02:33:32.138
LIAM: Caleb reads the tunnel and just says,

02:33:32.138 --> 02:33:33.562
Nord, Nord, Nord.

02:33:33.562 --> 02:33:34.683
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:34.683 --> 02:33:36.903
TRAVIS: "Hello," reforms into "Leet."

02:33:36.903 --> 02:33:41.653
(laughter)

02:33:43.103 --> 02:33:44.446
MATT: But you find your way back.

02:33:46.036 --> 02:33:48.353
MARISHA: That was awesome and I don't recommend it

02:33:48.353 --> 02:33:49.243
at the same time.

02:33:49.243 --> 02:33:50.613
LAURA: What happened?

02:33:50.613 --> 02:33:52.413
MARISHA: I saw Yussa.

02:33:52.413 --> 02:33:56.286
He's here, he's on the surface still wandering,

02:33:57.423 --> 02:33:58.736
just wandering around.

02:34:00.008 --> 02:34:01.549
He doesn't--

02:34:03.408 --> 02:34:05.805
He doesn't appear lost, yet.

02:34:05.805 --> 02:34:07.333
LAURA: Maybe we can recruit him?

02:34:07.333 --> 02:34:11.223
MARISHA: Yeah, he's maybe a mile or so from here.

02:34:11.223 --> 02:34:12.373
He's not far.

02:34:12.373 --> 02:34:13.670
TRAVIS: A specific direction?

02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:16.684
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. East is what you said?

02:34:16.684 --> 02:34:19.023
MATT: It's hard to say north, west, east, south

02:34:19.023 --> 02:34:20.463
because there is no real direction here.

02:34:20.463 --> 02:34:21.983
But if you're looking from an overhead point

02:34:21.983 --> 02:34:23.843
of where you are, it's the best way

02:34:23.843 --> 02:34:25.233
you could triangulate it, yeah.

02:34:25.233 --> 02:34:27.593
MARISHA: Okay, I think I could track him, but I--

02:34:30.383 --> 02:34:32.403
I think I was noticed.

02:34:32.403 --> 02:34:34.203
LAURA: What do you mean you were noticed?

02:34:35.503 --> 02:34:39.253
MARISHA: It's hard to describe because it's so amorphous,

02:34:39.253 --> 02:34:42.041
but like a burning red sensation,

02:34:42.041 --> 02:34:43.735
like another eye, a force.

02:34:43.735 --> 02:34:46.573
MATT: As she's speaking, the wall behind her,

02:34:46.573 --> 02:34:49.923
you watch as the stone begins to bulge.

02:34:49.923 --> 02:34:52.173
MARISHA: Maybe we should go.
MATT: The color turns

02:34:52.173 --> 02:34:54.036
a deep crimson.
LAURA: We go.

02:34:54.036 --> 02:34:55.963
MARISHA: I think it knows where we are.

02:34:55.963 --> 02:34:57.263
TRAVIS: Move.
LAURA: Move, move, move.

02:34:57.263 --> 02:34:58.503
TRAVIS: We run, we run.

02:34:58.503 --> 02:34:59.833
MATT: You run.

02:34:59.833 --> 02:35:02.963
You head back to the tunnel, charging back where you were,

02:35:02.963 --> 02:35:05.266
just running through the darkness.

02:35:06.913 --> 02:35:08.613
A bright red light begins to push

02:35:08.613 --> 02:35:10.113
from one of the walls as you pass.

02:35:10.113 --> 02:35:11.243
MARISHA: Oh, like that.

02:35:11.243 --> 02:35:12.322
It looked exactly like that.

02:35:12.322 --> 02:35:13.483
TRAVIS and LAURA: Keep going, keep going!

02:35:13.483 --> 02:35:15.153
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: Which way, where?

02:35:15.153 --> 02:35:16.616
TRAVIS: We're just running through the tunnel back.

02:35:16.616 --> 02:35:17.691
SAM: To the Help tunnel?
LAURA: Are we going to the Help tunnel?

02:35:17.691 --> 02:35:18.653
LIAM: Back to the intersection.

02:35:18.653 --> 02:35:19.780
MATT: Okay.

02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:21.863
You continue to run towards the intersection.

02:35:21.863 --> 02:35:23.913
As you're reaching the point of the mid area,

02:35:23.913 --> 02:35:25.983
you see from the floor bubbling up

02:35:25.983 --> 02:35:28.563
that same bright red light,

02:35:28.563 --> 02:35:29.633
that spherical light,

02:35:29.633 --> 02:35:31.693
the same way that you saw push through

02:35:31.693 --> 02:35:33.513
some of the people of this town begin

02:35:33.513 --> 02:35:37.933
to push from beneath the skin-like ground as you run past.

02:35:37.933 --> 02:35:39.624
You arc around it.

02:35:39.624 --> 02:35:41.442
SAM: Fjord, Marine Layer!

02:35:41.442 --> 02:35:42.798
TRAVIS: I already thought of it.

02:35:42.798 --> 02:35:45.473
(laughter)

02:35:45.473 --> 02:35:49.333
LAURA: I'm going to cast Calm Emotions on the orb.

02:35:49.333 --> 02:35:50.513
MATT: On the orb?

02:35:50.513 --> 02:35:53.153
Okay, what's the DC on that?
MARISHA: Good idea.

02:35:53.153 --> 02:35:54.863
LAURA: 18.
TRAVIS: Good call.

02:35:54.863 --> 02:35:55.723
MARISHA: Do it, do it.

02:35:55.723 --> 02:35:57.706
MARISHA: That's a fail.
LAURA: Great.

02:35:59.373 --> 02:36:03.573
I can make the target indifferent about us.

02:36:03.573 --> 02:36:04.918
MATT: Indeed.

02:36:04.918 --> 02:36:05.751
TRAVIS: Fucking--

02:36:05.751 --> 02:36:07.643
MATT: And as you rush to the intersection

02:36:07.643 --> 02:36:10.783
and grab the rails to begin climbing,

02:36:10.783 --> 02:36:13.193
you just hear a voice peek through

02:36:13.193 --> 02:36:14.463
all of your minds.

02:36:14.463 --> 02:36:16.604
It says,

02:36:16.604 --> 02:36:19.179
"Wait, where are you going?"

02:36:21.863 --> 02:36:23.937
MARISHA: It's a Somnovem.

02:36:23.937 --> 02:36:24.770
LAURA: Yeah.

02:36:25.883 --> 02:36:26.993
MARISHA: It's one of them.

02:36:26.993 --> 02:36:27.933
LAURA: Do you want to talk to it?

02:36:27.933 --> 02:36:30.513
It's indifferent to us now.
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:36:30.513 --> 02:36:33.303
TALIESIN: Who are you?
LIAM: Maybe it's in a good mood?

02:36:33.303 --> 02:36:35.413
SAM: Yeah, how long does the spell last?

02:36:35.413 --> 02:36:36.673
LAURA: A minute.

02:36:36.673 --> 02:36:38.465
SAM: We could get in a couple of words.

02:36:38.465 --> 02:36:39.298
LAURA: Ask it some questions?

02:36:39.298 --> 02:36:40.733
LIAM: Yeah, talk to it, Jester.

02:36:40.733 --> 02:36:41.980
TALIESIN: Who are you?

02:36:43.691 --> 02:36:48.691
MATT: "You arrive by sheer force of love and family,

02:36:49.283 --> 02:36:52.283
"protecting those that bring you joy and meaning.

02:36:52.283 --> 02:36:56.683
"That is true purpose.

02:36:56.683 --> 02:36:58.683
"Through these bonds eternal, everything,

02:36:59.703 --> 02:37:00.793
"everything has meaning.

02:37:00.793 --> 02:37:02.743
"We seek to bond everything in love

02:37:02.743 --> 02:37:06.943
"and to become one as we all are.

02:37:06.943 --> 02:37:11.943
"Absolute, eternal love, without boundaries."

02:37:11.973 --> 02:37:13.393
LIAM: What is your name?

02:37:13.393 --> 02:37:15.070
MATT: "I am Gaudius."

02:37:15.070 --> 02:37:16.473
MARISHA: That's Gaudius.

02:37:16.473 --> 02:37:19.056
SAM: Wait, that was the one that was oblivion.

02:37:20.313 --> 02:37:21.306
Not love.

02:37:25.021 --> 02:37:26.793
TRAVIS: I mean, kind of the same.

02:37:26.793 --> 02:37:29.666
MATT: "Glad I could catch you
while the others are distracted.

02:37:30.553 --> 02:37:33.183
"Everyone searches for the Nonagon.

02:37:33.183 --> 02:37:35.713
"And I was curious.

02:37:35.713 --> 02:37:39.036
"You all seem to have been marked, most of you, at least.

02:37:40.353 --> 02:37:41.903
"Welcome."

02:37:45.733 --> 02:37:49.028
LIAM: What would bring all of you joy?

02:37:50.243 --> 02:37:53.926
MATT: "I do not know what would bring all of us joy.

02:37:54.903 --> 02:37:58.396
"We all have different ideas when we're apart.

02:38:02.113 --> 02:38:06.593
"I hate to bother, but it's rare that we

02:38:06.593 --> 02:38:10.024
"find those that, well,

02:38:10.969 --> 02:38:12.602
"are separate."

02:38:14.053 --> 02:38:16.149
SAM: How can we bring you love?

02:38:18.573 --> 02:38:20.058
Who can we talk to?

02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:23.325
MATT: "I worry.

02:38:25.350 --> 02:38:28.350
"I just want to bring this love to everyone.

02:38:28.350 --> 02:38:30.806
"I want us to all come together.

02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:36.830
"But Fastidan and Culpasi, they reject the embrace."

02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:38.128
SAM: What, what?
LAURA: Wait, what a--

02:38:38.128 --> 02:38:39.515
MARISHA: Culpasi?
TRAVIS: Fastidan and Culpasi?

02:38:39.515 --> 02:38:41.181
MATT: Fastidan and Culpasi.

02:38:41.181 --> 02:38:43.270
MARISHA: Fastidan.
LAURA: Culpasty? (laughs)

02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:44.260
TALIESIN: Why?

02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:47.690
MATT: "They are driven from unity through disgust,

02:38:47.690 --> 02:38:50.736
"arrogance, and deeply misplaced shame.

02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:54.750
"They would divide and maintain

02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:58.820
"the horrid separation that plagues all life in the cosmos,

02:38:58.820 --> 02:39:01.873
"breeding strife through loneliness and misunderstanding.

02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:06.713
"If you could show love for each other, and for us,

02:39:08.890 --> 02:39:11.460
"could you find where they're harbored

02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.130
"within the Aether Crux,

02:39:13.130 --> 02:39:18.130
"and maybe grant them their separation

02:39:18.413 --> 02:39:22.779
"from reality as they so seek,

02:39:22.779 --> 02:39:26.323
"so that the rest of us might join without doubt?

02:39:26.323 --> 02:39:27.256
"Please."

02:39:28.130 --> 02:39:29.928
SAM: Yep, we're on it, okay, bye!

02:39:29.928 --> 02:39:31.030
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:34.535
MARISHA: Tell them-- is the Aether Crux maybe, like,

02:39:34.535 --> 02:39:36.150
in the center of everything,

02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:39.880
maybe down, looks like it's a planet

02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:42.800
in a gravitational field?

02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:46.260
MATT: "Yeah, more or less."
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, cool.

02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:47.910
MATT: "If the others aren't watching,

02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:50.200
"I could maybe help you get there."

02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:52.808
MARISHA: Do you all live there? Is that, like,

02:39:52.808 --> 02:39:56.499
your all's bunk? Are you roommates?
MATT: "We are and aren't.

02:39:56.499 --> 02:39:58.837
"We are everywhere in this city.

02:39:58.837 --> 02:40:02.830
"But we come together there, mostly."

02:40:02.830 --> 02:40:04.892
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:40:04.892 --> 02:40:06.801
SAM: Good talk, good talk, it's probably running off--

02:40:06.801 --> 02:40:09.853
MARISHA: Yeah, I think-- I don't think we need directions.

02:40:11.730 --> 02:40:13.294
'Kay, bye.

02:40:13.294 --> 02:40:15.377
MATT: (laughs)

02:40:16.430 --> 02:40:18.050
Who wants to make the persuasion check

02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:19.509
that you're all on the up and up with this?

02:40:19.509 --> 02:40:20.657
TRAVIS: I do.

02:40:20.657 --> 02:40:21.490
(laughter)

02:40:21.490 --> 02:40:23.006
LIAM: Yes, yes.
MARISHA: Come on, you're--

02:40:23.006 --> 02:40:25.200
MATT: How do you present this case,

02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:27.710
that you are indeed listening to this individual

02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:30.500
that is like awaiting a deep confirmation

02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:32.300
that you're allied?

02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:35.620
TRAVIS: We will find Fastidan and Culpasi,

02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:38.200
and make sure that they are separated via the Aether Crux,

02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:39.090
as you wish.

02:40:39.090 --> 02:40:40.180
LAURA: I'm going to try to give him advantage,

02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:43.550
and I'm going to go up and hug my arms around his waist,

02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:47.800
and go: All we care about in this world is love and unity.

02:40:48.737 --> 02:40:49.653
(lip smacking)

02:40:49.653 --> 02:40:50.978
And I kiss him.
MATT: All right, are you taking that

02:40:50.978 --> 02:40:53.073
as a persuasion or a deception?
SAM: He just leaned away from you.

02:40:53.073 --> 02:40:54.144
LAURA: (laughs) I know he did.

02:40:54.144 --> 02:40:56.073
MATT: Do you intend to follow through on this deal?

02:40:56.073 --> 02:40:57.410
TRAVIS: No, this is deception.

02:40:57.410 --> 02:41:00.053
MATT: Make a deception roll.

02:41:00.053 --> 02:41:01.280
SAM: You just kiss his shoulder.

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:02.970
LIAM: Chewing on his jawline.

02:41:02.970 --> 02:41:04.904
TRAVIS: 24.
MATT: 24.

02:41:04.904 --> 02:41:06.030
TRAVIS: Plus 10 on my deception.

02:41:06.030 --> 02:41:08.530
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah, face man.

02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:11.780
MATT: The red eye that is buoyed up from the ground,

02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:15.740
and you can see now, it's spiraled up like this

02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:18.780
twisted arm of a tether that ends in the glowing orb

02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:21.910
of this eye with a strange bead of orange-yellow

02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:23.620
pupil-like light in the center.

02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:27.050
And it's odd, because it has no facial features to speak of,

02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:28.780
but there's something about the voice and the light

02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:33.420
that is oddly comforting in the way it speaks.

02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:36.810
And those of you with high enough passive insight,

02:41:36.810 --> 02:41:41.000
given the place you are, makes it even more off-putting.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.440
But as you finish your statement,

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:45.350
and your display of affection,

02:41:45.350 --> 02:41:46.920
the eye begins to withdraw.

02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:49.660
"Then, go quickly."
TRAVIS: Our prom pose.

02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:53.190
MATT: "I sense that once their search is done,

02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:54.760
"and they find the Nonagon,

02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:57.090
"we'll be called together once more.

02:41:57.090 --> 02:42:00.500
"And when our minds are one, we cannot speak, like this."

02:42:00.500 --> 02:42:03.053
And the eye, (whoosh) vanishes into the floor.

02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:06.790
TALIESIN: We are just making friends.

02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:08.612
SAM: Yeah, that was great.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:42:08.612 --> 02:42:10.382
LAURA: Did Calm Emotions help at all in this?

02:42:10.382 --> 02:42:12.307
Or was it always-- never mind.

02:42:12.307 --> 02:42:14.460
TRAVIS: Fastidan and Culpasi.
MATT: It did help.

02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:18.720
TRAVIS: They want division and things that are probably

02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:20.090
more in line with what we want,

02:42:20.090 --> 02:42:21.634
rather than everybody being connected.

02:42:21.634 --> 02:42:24.867
SAM: And they're being held in Aether Crux.

02:42:24.867 --> 02:42:26.485
TRAVIS: They're part of the-- yeah, they're part of the--

02:42:26.485 --> 02:42:28.410
MATT: It lowered the DCs needed for any sort of--

02:42:28.410 --> 02:42:30.600
TRAVIS: Because we needed three more names, I think--

02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:31.647
MARISHA: We did.
TRAVIS: -- and that was two of them.

02:42:31.647 --> 02:42:33.465
MARISHA: And I'm assuming the ninth is Nonagon.

02:42:33.465 --> 02:42:35.805
TRAVIS: I think so.
LAURA: Maybe.

02:42:35.805 --> 02:42:37.250
TALIESIN: I still want to see the help.

02:42:37.250 --> 02:42:41.111
MARISHA: Unless it's a master
emotion or something like that,

02:42:41.111 --> 02:42:41.944
like the master.
TRAVIS: Wait.

02:42:41.944 --> 02:42:44.750
Where you saw, was it a mile on the surface,

02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:48.363
or are we potentially taking this "help, help, help" tunnel?

02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:51.113
Is that easterly?

02:42:51.113 --> 02:42:52.013
MARISHA: Would I know that?

02:42:52.013 --> 02:42:53.350
MATT: The "help, help" tunnel would be more of,

02:42:53.350 --> 02:42:54.183
if you're looking at that

02:42:54.183 --> 02:42:55.444
sort of different directional pass,

02:42:55.444 --> 02:42:56.344
it would be the different direction.

02:42:56.344 --> 02:42:58.050
TRAVIS: Got it.
MARISHA: Yeah, the other way.

02:42:58.050 --> 02:43:00.330
And it was on the surface, it was a mile on the surface.

02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:01.684
SAM: That's where Yussa is.

02:43:01.684 --> 02:43:02.954
MARISHA: That's where Yussa is, but he--

02:43:02.954 --> 02:43:03.979
SAM: But the Aether Crux,

02:43:03.979 --> 02:43:06.388
you felt down.
MARISHA: Is in the center and down.

02:43:06.388 --> 02:43:08.250
SAM: And could you guide us there?

02:43:09.538 --> 02:43:11.332
MATT: You could certainly try.

02:43:12.207 --> 02:43:14.150
MARISHA: I could certainly try.

02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:16.790
LIAM: Do we want to spend the time

02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:20.663
to try to pull Yussa out of wherever he is?

02:43:20.663 --> 02:43:22.930
TRAVIS: I was just thinking that, because it just his--

02:43:22.930 --> 02:43:23.822
LIAM: Yeah.

02:43:23.822 --> 02:43:25.979
LAURA: But if he's astral projecting or something,

02:43:25.979 --> 02:43:26.912
he can still help.
LIAM: But if he could leave,

02:43:26.912 --> 02:43:27.785
he would have by now.

02:43:27.785 --> 02:43:28.618
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:43:28.618 --> 02:43:30.607
LAURA: So we should try to get him out.

02:43:30.607 --> 02:43:31.750
LIAM: Or we're abandoning him.

02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:34.250
TRAVIS: Feels like he might be the fly stuck in the flytrap.

02:43:34.250 --> 02:43:35.083
LIAM: I think so.

02:43:35.998 --> 02:43:38.360
TRAVIS: But if we set him free, then (whoosh).

02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:39.852
LIAM: At least he can go home.

02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:43.286
MATT: Maybe. Make an arcana check.

02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:48.013
LIAM: 27.

02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:51.523
MATT: In theory, yes.

02:43:53.130 --> 02:43:54.810
Depending on how the astral body

02:43:54.810 --> 02:43:56.700
has been captured or tethered.

02:43:56.700 --> 02:44:01.700
Everything here is far beyond even just the studies

02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:05.500
of astral travel, astral projection,

02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:10.190
and elements here defy or supersede previous knowledge.

02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:12.570
There is a good chance, you imagine,

02:44:12.570 --> 02:44:16.080
that upon destroying or, you know,

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:18.590
absolving the connection of this place that, yeah,

02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:20.190
Yussa may be set free in return.

02:44:21.530 --> 02:44:23.930
Or he could be destroyed along with it.

02:44:23.930 --> 02:44:25.150
You don't know.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:29.180
MATT: Your roll at least offers the confirmation

02:44:29.180 --> 02:44:31.170
of a possibility of either.

02:44:31.170 --> 02:44:34.470
LIAM: Well, even if he doesn't know,

02:44:34.470 --> 02:44:39.180
I believe that if we leave this city adrift,

02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:41.720
he's just going to drift with it.

02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:45.493
And if we don't try, that's it for him.

02:44:45.493 --> 02:44:47.910
LAURA: So if we defeat the city--
LIAM: He's because of us.

02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:50.090
LAURA: And we destroy it completely,

02:44:50.090 --> 02:44:51.580
he'll potentially be released,

02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:53.893
along with all of the other thousands of people?

02:44:54.750 --> 02:44:56.650
TALIESIN: Maybe.
LIAM: Whatever that means.

02:44:56.650 --> 02:44:59.880
TRAVIS: It seems like the Aether Crux might be the (groans)

02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:01.530
port by which we do that.

02:45:01.530 --> 02:45:02.530
Maybe there's a way that we--

02:45:02.530 --> 02:45:03.710
LAURA: Maybe it's like the heart.

02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:06.150
TRAVIS: Yeah, if it's like an entryway in,

02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:08.856
it could also be a point of egress out, so.

02:45:08.856 --> 02:45:12.040
MARISHA: I wonder if that's where Lucien is.

02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:13.520
LAURA: Maybe that's why they can't see him.

02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:15.930
TRAVIS: I mean, I certainly don't want to destroy his mind

02:45:15.930 --> 02:45:17.460
in the matrix, and then his body dies

02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:19.413
back in Exandria, but--

02:45:20.860 --> 02:45:22.050
MARISHA: I mean, he's been here for a while,

02:45:22.050 --> 02:45:24.500
you don't think that he could help?

02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:26.787
Don't think he'd be of any use?

02:45:26.787 --> 02:45:29.340
LAURA: I don't know if they really explore the city,

02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:33.757
the people that live here, or if they roam aimlessly.

02:45:35.936 --> 02:45:36.977
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:45:38.278 --> 02:45:39.850
LIAM: I think we owe it to him.

02:45:39.850 --> 02:45:40.683
TRAVIS: And we're sure,

02:45:40.683 --> 02:45:43.183
we're sure he didn't want to be connected, right?

02:45:43.183 --> 02:45:46.260
He was just-- curiosity got the cat?

02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:47.210
TALIESIN: Who would--?

02:45:47.210 --> 02:45:48.170
LAURA: There's no way to know.

02:45:48.170 --> 02:45:50.770
LIAM: He was looking-- well, yeah, his motives.

02:45:50.770 --> 02:45:51.603
TRAVIS: Yes, but.

02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:54.498
SAM: If we go up after Yussa,

02:45:54.498 --> 02:45:58.510
it could delay us a half a day.

02:45:58.510 --> 02:46:00.030
TALIESIN: Maybe.
LAURA: It's a mile away.

02:46:00.030 --> 02:46:01.910
It could delay us an hour.

02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:03.650
LIAM: Half a day with problems.

02:46:03.650 --> 02:46:05.760
SAM: With problems, yes, but that's okay,

02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:10.030
because we've destroyed-- well, we've taken care of a crest.

02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:12.040
LIAM: So it's not going home.

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:12.900
TALIESIN: Not yet.

02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:14.958
TRAVIS: Unless Lucien somehow leaves here

02:46:14.958 --> 02:46:16.960
and comes back, but--

02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:18.923
SAM: Or the other thing I was thinking.

02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:23.973
We've seen some pretty cool things with time bending here.

02:46:26.450 --> 02:46:30.720
I don't know, could he undo us taking the crest away?

02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:33.117
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: We time bend,

02:46:33.117 --> 02:46:35.070
not this place.

02:46:35.070 --> 02:46:38.240
SAM: No, but there's technology around that--

02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:39.650
TALIESIN: Not here.

02:46:39.650 --> 02:46:41.128
SAM: But in Aeor.
LAURA: As far as we know.

02:46:41.128 --> 02:46:42.290
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: As far as we know.

02:46:42.290 --> 02:46:44.070
TRAVIS: This place did have technology

02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:46.560
far more advanced than us, thousands.

02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:48.980
TALIESIN: It would be meat at this point.

02:46:48.980 --> 02:46:50.520
MARISHA: Yeah, he's got a point.

02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:54.310
LIAM: Well, it's an unknown, because there undoubtedly

02:46:54.310 --> 02:46:57.370
was things like that here.

02:46:57.370 --> 02:46:59.574
And maybe they work, or maybe they don't.

02:46:59.574 --> 02:47:01.930
TALIESIN: I've seen very few real things here.

02:47:01.930 --> 02:47:03.870
LIAM: I understand, but--
TALIESIN: But yeah.

02:47:03.870 --> 02:47:07.501
LIAM: This is also very-- reality seems fluid.

02:47:07.501 --> 02:47:08.800
TRAVIS: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Fair.

02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:11.330
SAM: The only thing that we've done consistently,

02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:13.530
the only choice that we've ever consistently made

02:47:13.530 --> 02:47:15.740
is to take care of our friends.

02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:16.573
LAURA: So we go help him.

02:47:16.573 --> 02:47:18.047
TRAVIS and SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Let's go.

02:47:18.047 --> 02:47:18.880
TALIESIN: Moving.

02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:20.100
MARISHA: Okay.

02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:24.320
Can I try and guide us back as quickly

02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:25.760
as I feel I remember?

02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:29.690
MATT: Certainly, as you all emerge from the trap tunnel

02:47:29.690 --> 02:47:31.890
back to the surface streets, you can see

02:47:31.890 --> 02:47:35.320
once more the aimless bodies of the denizens

02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:38.210
wandering directionless, going through the motions

02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:40.560
of their previous lives, these stilted echoes

02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:42.100
of who they once were.

02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:45.700
And you all begin to will yourselves upward,

02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:49.480
flying back above the cityline itself,

02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.093
heading in the direction of Beauregard's guidance.

02:47:52.930 --> 02:47:53.763
So you're guiding them.

02:47:53.763 --> 02:47:55.222
Would you mind making a perception check roll?

02:47:55.222 --> 02:47:56.705
LAURA: Can I give her Guidance to--?

02:47:56.705 --> 02:47:57.863
MATT: Sure.

02:47:57.863 --> 02:47:59.386
MARISHA: ♪ Guide my guidance ♪

02:47:59.386 --> 02:48:00.780
LIAM: Gweedance.

02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:03.097
MATT: Yo dawg, I heard you like to be guided.

02:48:04.430 --> 02:48:07.530
MARISHA: What did you-- perception?

02:48:07.530 --> 02:48:09.263
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: You just killed us, didn't you?

02:48:09.263 --> 02:48:11.646
MARISHA: Oh, that's not-- I'm not good at this already.

02:48:11.646 --> 02:48:12.990
Eight.

02:48:12.990 --> 02:48:13.823
MATT: Eight.

02:48:13.823 --> 02:48:14.700
LAURA: That's real bad.

02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:16.810
MARISHA: It's real bad, I rolled a three.

02:48:16.810 --> 02:48:18.730
MATT: Eight, it takes you a little longer

02:48:18.730 --> 02:48:20.400
than you would have hoped.

02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:21.353
LIAM: There was problems.

02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:27.520
MATT: But you do still manage to zero in

02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:29.270
on the neighborhood that you recall.

02:48:29.270 --> 02:48:31.100
It's challenging largely because a lot

02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:32.290
of these streets are patterned.

02:48:32.290 --> 02:48:34.500
And so after a certain time of travel,

02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:35.930
you begin to wonder if you've circled back,

02:48:35.930 --> 02:48:38.600
because it seems like you've already been this way.

02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:40.870
But then you begin to notice the smaller details,

02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:43.450
and realize that, no, the movements here seem different,

02:48:43.450 --> 02:48:45.260
and you look back, and you're traveling.

02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:47.970
It's just that that odd fractal pattern

02:48:47.970 --> 02:48:50.603
to the city's expansion just messes with your head,

02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:55.710
until eventually you find that similar neighborhood

02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:58.423
that you recall sensing, where you sensed Yussa.

02:48:59.690 --> 02:49:01.690
Took you a little longer.
MARISHA: Shit.

02:49:01.690 --> 02:49:05.953
MATT: But as you touch down in that area,

02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:12.240
you all can see just around the edge of the corner,

02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:17.240
a figure, white-silver short hair, darker skin,

02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.993
flowing golden robes, just walking, walking away.

02:49:23.461 --> 02:49:25.813
LIAM: I'm going to pick up my pace and catch up to him.

02:49:25.813 --> 02:49:27.120
TALIESIN: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:31.181
SAM: When you go up to him, Caleb just go, (shrieks).

02:49:31.181 --> 02:49:33.926
(laughter)

02:49:33.926 --> 02:49:35.480
SAM: That way you'll blend in, right?

02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:37.810
TRAVIS: Customary greeting.

02:49:37.810 --> 02:49:39.260
MATT: You approach, and as you get closer,

02:49:39.260 --> 02:49:42.510
you can see his features are blurred.

02:49:42.510 --> 02:49:44.280
This is not a full corporeal form.

02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:48.480
This is a somewhat spectral-looking image of Yussa

02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:51.580
that still remains with each footfall connected,

02:49:51.580 --> 02:49:54.710
tethered to Cognouza, like the other denizens.

02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:56.643
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

02:49:56.643 --> 02:50:00.978
LIAM: Yussa, it's me. It's Caleb.

02:50:00.978 --> 02:50:04.040
MATT: He's been facing away from you, and turns around,

02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:05.810
and where the face would be,

02:50:05.810 --> 02:50:07.920
you just see this open vacuous hole.

02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:09.700
LAURA: Ooh.
MATT: This dark space,

02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:11.230
it just looks back at you.

02:50:11.230 --> 02:50:12.130
LIAM: Can you hear me?

02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:15.890
Can you speak?

02:50:15.890 --> 02:50:17.860
MATT: There's no voice.

02:50:17.860 --> 02:50:19.903
There's recognition because it turned,

02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:23.050
but nothing beyond that.

02:50:23.050 --> 02:50:26.760
LIAM: I think towards his form, and say:

02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:29.433
Raise your hand if you understand me.

02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:32.599
LAURA: Can you still think towards people?

02:50:32.599 --> 02:50:33.820
LIAM: That's what I said, yeah.

02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:36.220
LAURA: I know, but with Mind Blank.

02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:37.460
LIAM: Oh, I don't know,

02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:39.620
but I'm shielded from people controlling me.

02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:41.280
MATT: He can still use his mind, I'd say.

02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:42.192
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: But it's--

02:50:42.192 --> 02:50:43.025
LIAM: (yelps)

02:50:43.025 --> 02:50:44.938
(laughter)

02:50:44.938 --> 02:50:47.039
MATT: Cast Mind Blank! (thuds)

02:50:47.039 --> 02:50:48.266
(laughter)

02:50:48.266 --> 02:50:49.795
LAURA: I just meant like--
TRAVIS: I don't think that did

02:50:49.795 --> 02:50:51.007
what you think it was going to do.

02:50:51.007 --> 02:50:53.140
LIAM: Did I negate the powers I got?

02:50:53.140 --> 02:50:54.040
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:54.873
MATT: Right.

02:50:56.210 --> 02:50:58.123
There is no response.

02:50:58.123 --> 02:50:59.572
LIAM: (sighs)

02:50:59.572 --> 02:51:00.797
TALIESIN: It's going to be weird.

02:51:00.797 --> 02:51:04.192
I'm going to cast Guidance on Yussa.

02:51:04.192 --> 02:51:05.233
MATT: On Yussa?

02:51:08.550 --> 02:51:10.003
TALIESIN: We need you to focus.

02:51:11.390 --> 02:51:12.803
Come here and be with us.

02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:18.920
MATT: Make an arcana check, Caleb.

02:51:19.810 --> 02:51:21.060
LIAM: I have an idea as well.

02:51:22.046 --> 02:51:24.502
That is a 21.

02:51:24.502 --> 02:51:25.335
MATT: 21.

02:51:27.010 --> 02:51:30.550
The magic that tethers him here

02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:32.780
continues to tether him here.

02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:35.570
And you can just vaguely see on the outline of the body,

02:51:35.570 --> 02:51:37.880
this silver cord that drifts

02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:40.730
and then vanishes into the ether

02:51:40.730 --> 02:51:42.880
that represents the connection to the body.

02:51:44.970 --> 02:51:48.280
So the spell that has brought Yussa here,

02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:50.830
though captured as he is, still remains,

02:51:50.830 --> 02:51:53.040
and still is part of what keeps him caged.

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:56.613
LAURA: So, we could potentially dispel it.

02:51:57.450 --> 02:52:00.583
LIAM: I reach my hands into his form.

02:52:03.832 --> 02:52:06.178
And I banish him back to the material plane.

02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:19.551
MATT: As your hands alight with energy,

02:52:19.551 --> 02:52:20.920
there is a (whoosh),

02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:23.540
a sudden burst of life and movement

02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:25.620
from Yussa's somewhat spectral form.

02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:30.590
And in that movement, there is a facade

02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:33.810
of that faceless image that is left behind

02:52:33.810 --> 02:52:37.090
like a ghosted shadow as Yussa's spirit

02:52:37.090 --> 02:52:38.680
is pushed out of it briefly.

02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:41.310
And you can see the face of Yussa looking back at you

02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:45.551
through it, into a smile and just says,

02:52:45.551 --> 02:52:47.034
"Thank you."

02:52:48.169 --> 02:52:50.250
(whoosh) And you watch it as the spirit

02:52:50.250 --> 02:52:53.410
is lifted on the tether, like a parachute cord,

02:52:53.410 --> 02:52:55.795
and dragged away.

02:52:55.795 --> 02:52:57.467
MARISHA: (exhales) Okay.

02:52:57.467 --> 02:52:58.335
LIAM: Okay.

02:52:58.335 --> 02:52:59.168
LAURA: He's free.

02:52:59.168 --> 02:53:00.417
TALIESIN: Well, that's one good deed for the day.

02:53:00.417 --> 02:53:01.250
MARISHA: Okay.

02:53:01.250 --> 02:53:03.500
SAM: Does he come back in a minute, or--
MARISHA: He's not help, but you know.

02:53:03.500 --> 02:53:04.678
SAM: Does he just stay there?

02:53:04.678 --> 02:53:06.065
LAURA: No, I think he's gone.

02:53:06.065 --> 02:53:08.850
LIAM: I don't think he was in a place to help us.

02:53:08.850 --> 02:53:09.893
MARISHA: No, no.

02:53:11.230 --> 02:53:12.690
LAURA: So now we find our way back down.

02:53:12.690 --> 02:53:15.940
LIAM: Yes, yes.

02:53:15.940 --> 02:53:17.670
TALIESIN: Mom used to say, "useful like a hole in the head."

02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:19.142
I think that's what she meant.

02:53:19.142 --> 02:53:21.430
(laughter)

02:53:21.430 --> 02:53:22.300
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:25.073
LAURA: Beau, did you see where the Crux was?

02:53:27.203 --> 02:53:29.120
MARISHA: It's hard to describe,

02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:32.890
but it just felt like the absolute

02:53:32.890 --> 02:53:36.663
center of this place, like a fixated point.

02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:39.100
LAURA: Above ground or below?

02:53:39.100 --> 02:53:41.414
MARISHA: Below, right?

02:53:41.414 --> 02:53:42.292
MATT: Yeah.

02:53:44.892 --> 02:53:46.542
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:53:46.542 --> 02:53:49.880
Do I feel like I have-- or would I fuck it up

02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:51.720
like I fucked us getting to Yussa?

02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:53.532
Could I get us back down?

02:53:53.532 --> 02:53:54.374
LIAM: Fuck it up.

02:53:54.374 --> 02:53:56.250
MATT: How would you want to get back down?

02:53:58.370 --> 02:54:01.970
MARISHA: Walking. I'd like to walk there.

02:54:01.970 --> 02:54:04.560
How do you-- wait, can I-- wait.

02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:05.950
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa.
MARISHA: Wait.

02:54:05.950 --> 02:54:06.783
LIAM: How would you like to down this?

02:54:06.783 --> 02:54:08.770
LAURA: We have to find a way down. You know what?

02:54:08.770 --> 02:54:11.360
Maybe we just ask somebody for help.

02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:13.330
Maybe we ask one of the Somnovem.

02:54:13.330 --> 02:54:15.533
MARISHA: Maybe we just imagine ourselves there.

02:54:16.654 --> 02:54:18.150
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:54:18.150 --> 02:54:19.340
MATT: Are you going to do that?
LIAM: Might as well.

02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:20.331
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:54:20.331 --> 02:54:21.393
LAURA: All right, let's try it!

02:54:21.393 --> 02:54:22.980
ASHLEY: Fuck with the--

02:54:22.980 --> 02:54:24.552
LAURA: What does it look like?
TRAVIS: Fuck with the what?

02:54:24.552 --> 02:54:26.533
LIAM: Let's do it.
ASHLEY: Like how he opened up the--

02:54:26.533 --> 02:54:28.585
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: -- flesh.

02:54:28.585 --> 02:54:30.180
LIAM: Do you fuck with mind powers?

02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:32.240
MARISHA: Let's fuck with mind powers.

02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:33.465
Get near us, yeah.

02:54:33.465 --> 02:54:34.298
LAURA: Let's think of it.

02:54:34.298 --> 02:54:35.980
MARISHA: I'm going to loop around.

02:54:35.980 --> 02:54:37.170
Yeah, we're going to use--

02:54:37.170 --> 02:54:39.030
SAM: We're going to use the power of imagination?

02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:40.330
MARISHA: The power of mind bullets!

02:54:40.330 --> 02:54:42.205
LIAM: This is the place of dreams.

02:54:42.205 --> 02:54:44.283
We all have a lot of eyes amongst us.

02:54:44.283 --> 02:54:45.620
MARISHA: And I've already seen it.
SAM: This is going to look so stupid

02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:46.460
if it doesn't work.

02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:47.293
MARISHA: I've already seen it.

02:54:47.293 --> 02:54:49.143
LAURA: We've looked stupid before.

02:54:49.143 --> 02:54:50.860
LIAM: We're in an acid trip right now.

02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:52.026
LAURA: Over or under?

02:54:52.026 --> 02:54:54.583
MARISHA: Totally a fractal acid trip, I agree, I agree.

02:54:54.583 --> 02:54:55.940
LAURA: Like this, maybe?

02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:57.730
TRAVIS: Before we just prayer circle this thing,

02:54:57.730 --> 02:55:00.060
are there other drones walking nearby

02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:03.900
that were attracted by the banishing of a soul from this

02:55:03.900 --> 02:55:04.910
living city?
LIAM: You'd be the Laura Bailey.

02:55:04.910 --> 02:55:06.190
MATT: None of the other entit--

02:55:06.190 --> 02:55:08.450
There are other entities walking through here,

02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:11.250
different people from the ancient Aeorian times,

02:55:11.250 --> 02:55:14.300
themselves going about their

02:55:14.300 --> 02:55:17.558
ghosted, patterned non-lives,

02:55:17.558 --> 02:55:18.916
just as you've seen before.
TRAVIS: Creepy-ass.

02:55:18.916 --> 02:55:21.140
MATT: None were close enough who had been caught,

02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:24.270
or at least paid attention to this display yet.

02:55:24.270 --> 02:55:25.870
MARISHA: Are there any buildings,

02:55:25.870 --> 02:55:27.920
any alleys that we can tuck into?

02:55:29.390 --> 02:55:31.270
MATT: Yeah, there's a building

02:55:31.270 --> 02:55:33.740
immediately to your left, if you want to.

02:55:33.740 --> 02:55:34.573
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's all--

02:55:34.573 --> 02:55:36.239
TRAVIS: All right.
TALIESIN: This is weird to do out here.

02:55:36.239 --> 02:55:37.940
TRAVIS: Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.

02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:40.040
MATT: Okay, you go ahead and open the door,

02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:41.490
and as you pull the door, it's odd,

02:55:41.490 --> 02:55:42.600
because when you pull it,

02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:44.450
the door seems to stretch first,

02:55:44.450 --> 02:55:46.520
and then open behind you as you--

02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:47.755
LAURA: I hate this place.
MATT: -- pull it open.

02:55:47.755 --> 02:55:49.610
MARISHA: That's so grody.

02:55:49.610 --> 02:55:51.579
TRAVIS: What's it taste like?

02:55:51.579 --> 02:55:54.300
LAURA: Ew!
MARISHA: Ugh! No!

02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:55.638
MATT: A little salty.

02:55:55.638 --> 02:55:57.687
(groaning, laughter)

02:55:57.687 --> 02:56:01.328
LIAM: It's like A Christmas Story,
but 10,000 times worse.

02:56:01.328 --> 02:56:03.308
(laughter)

02:56:03.308 --> 02:56:04.809
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: His tongue gets close to mouth,

02:56:04.809 --> 02:56:05.785
goes (chomping) you know?

02:56:05.785 --> 02:56:09.030
LAURA: You guys remember the show Aaahh!!! Real Monsters?

02:56:09.030 --> 02:56:10.170
TRAVIS: Yes, Nickelodeon?

02:56:10.170 --> 02:56:12.539
LAURA: Do you remember the one that was the armpit monster?

02:56:12.539 --> 02:56:13.372
ALL: Yeah!

02:56:13.372 --> 02:56:14.513
LAURA: That's what I see.

02:56:14.513 --> 02:56:15.571
This whole place--
MARISHA: What was his name?

02:56:15.571 --> 02:56:17.012
LAURA: -- looks like the armpit monster.

02:56:17.012 --> 02:56:17.912
MATT: I can't remember.

02:56:17.912 --> 02:56:19.578
LIAM: A pity.
MARISHA: Anyway, yeah.

02:56:19.578 --> 02:56:22.170
ASHLEY: Wait, how many names did you guys write down

02:56:22.170 --> 02:56:24.734
of the Somnovem so far, seven or eight?

02:56:24.734 --> 02:56:26.100
MARISHA: I have eight.
TRAVIS: Eight.

02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:27.778
LAURA: Five, six, seven--
ASHLEY: What are they, again?

02:56:27.778 --> 02:56:31.116
SAM: Timorei, Elactus, Luctus, Ira--

02:56:31.116 --> 02:56:32.875
LIAM: Ira, Mirumus.
SAM: Miramus,

02:56:32.875 --> 02:56:34.708
Guardius, Fastidan,

02:56:34.708 --> 02:56:36.524
and Col-pussy!

02:56:36.524 --> 02:56:39.079
(laughter)

02:56:39.079 --> 02:56:40.262
LAURA: That's what I wrote, too.

02:56:40.262 --> 02:56:42.103
(laughter)

02:56:42.103 --> 02:56:44.160
LIAM: I just thought it, I didn't actually write it down

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:46.095
or say it out loud!

02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:50.900
TRAVIS: What was it? Col-pussy!

02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:51.916
TALIESIN: Well.

02:56:51.916 --> 02:56:53.499
MATT: Four more eyes appear on your body.

02:56:53.499 --> 02:56:55.136
(laughter)

02:56:55.136 --> 02:56:58.310
TRAVIS: (whooshing) Oh no!
LIAM: Are they eyes, though?

02:56:58.310 --> 02:57:01.950
MARISHA: And Matt, DM, from what you said before,

02:57:01.950 --> 02:57:03.480
from our memory, did we get any other

02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:06.940
emotional imprints to the other ones?

02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:07.931
LAURA: We haven't met all of them.

02:57:07.931 --> 02:57:09.530
MATT: You've only met three.

02:57:09.530 --> 02:57:11.711
MARISHA: And it was fear--
LIAM: Timorei was scared,

02:57:11.711 --> 02:57:12.952
Ira was wrathful.

02:57:12.952 --> 02:57:15.297
MARISHA: Was anger, yeah.
LIAM: Gaudius wanted oblivion.

02:57:15.297 --> 02:57:16.188
LAURA: But was loving.

02:57:16.188 --> 02:57:18.120
MARISHA: Was eternal love.

02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:21.036
And then Gaudius had mentioned

02:57:21.036 --> 02:57:25.309
Fastidan and Culpasti being--

02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:26.602
LIAM: Cold-pasty?

02:57:26.602 --> 02:57:28.780
MARISHA: -- arrogance and shameful, so I'm assuming

02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:31.743
that either one of those are arrogance and shame.

02:57:32.817 --> 02:57:35.105
TALIESIN: Remorse, maybe.

02:57:35.105 --> 02:57:36.860
LAURA: Should we try to bamf?

02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:38.326
What are we--
LIAM: Yeah, we're going.

02:57:38.326 --> 02:57:39.484
TALIESIN: We're going to use power of imagination.

02:57:39.484 --> 02:57:41.330
MARISHA: I'm just talking out of game.

02:57:41.330 --> 02:57:42.955
MATT: You've stepped into the bottom floor

02:57:42.955 --> 02:57:43.788
of this structure.

02:57:43.788 --> 02:57:46.560
On the inside, there is a semblance of an interior.

02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:50.310
You see furniture, you see candles on tables.

02:57:50.310 --> 02:57:52.360
And as you step down onto the floor,

02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:54.840
the floor gives slightly,

02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:57.060
and everything has a spongy texture to it.

02:57:57.060 --> 02:58:00.760
It's odd, but at least it's solid-ish.

02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:02.540
But you gather up.

02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:05.570
MARISHA: So I gather up, and first I project the image

02:58:05.570 --> 02:58:09.283
that I saw of the Aether Crux into Caleb's mind,

02:58:10.340 --> 02:58:14.850
trying to show him what I saw.

02:58:14.850 --> 02:58:19.023
And then I say: Help me share to them.

02:58:20.124 --> 02:58:21.270
LIAM: Little candles. (popping)

02:58:21.270 --> 02:58:24.740
MARISHA: Yeah, poof, poof, and I share the image

02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:29.653
to Caduceus and Fjord and Yasha, spread it out.

02:58:31.580 --> 02:58:33.830
And then I'm just going to look at everybody.

02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:37.193
Imagine we're there.

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:40.950
Does everybody see it in their heads?

02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:43.790
TALIESIN: Unfortunately.
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:58:43.790 --> 02:58:44.883
MARISHA: And--

02:58:46.250 --> 02:58:50.680
MATT: Have both of you roll a wisdom check

02:58:51.620 --> 02:58:54.530
with your wisdom modifier plus the number

02:58:54.530 --> 02:58:55.960
of eyes that you carry, which is three.

02:58:55.960 --> 02:58:57.030
LIAM: Wisdom modifier.

02:58:57.030 --> 02:58:58.813
MARISHA: Okay, please roll high this time.

02:59:00.890 --> 02:59:01.723
LIAM: Not good.

02:59:03.782 --> 02:59:06.240
MARISHA: Good for me.
LIAM: I got a 10, all totaled.

02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:07.637
MARISHA: 10 total?

02:59:08.620 --> 02:59:10.266
24.

02:59:10.266 --> 02:59:12.059
LIAM: Way better.

02:59:12.059 --> 02:59:12.892
MATT: 24?
MARISHA: 24.

02:59:12.892 --> 02:59:14.920
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I rolled a 17.

02:59:14.920 --> 02:59:18.828
MATT: You, Caleb, close your eyes,

02:59:18.828 --> 02:59:22.094
and focus, and concentrate.

02:59:24.640 --> 02:59:26.090
And you're having a hard time

02:59:27.310 --> 02:59:28.580
grasping what it means to will the--

02:59:28.580 --> 02:59:33.240
You have built a life about forcing the elements

02:59:33.240 --> 02:59:36.470
of the world to bend to your whims and ideas.

02:59:36.470 --> 02:59:37.650
And there's something in this moment

02:59:37.650 --> 02:59:38.840
that leaves you unfocused,

02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:41.653
and you're uncertain why you're being barred.

02:59:47.580 --> 02:59:52.473
And something opens inside your mind.

02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:00.000
You concentrate and focus on the image,

03:00:00.110 --> 03:00:05.110
and the sensation of the Aether Crux, the location.

03:00:07.220 --> 03:00:09.553
And as you're concentrating,

03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:14.758
you can't help but extend yourself a bit back to Cognouza.

03:00:14.758 --> 03:00:15.591
MARISHA: Sure.

03:00:15.591 --> 03:00:17.493
MATT: To connect once more to this network,

03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:21.343
and you all hear a strange sound.

03:00:22.954 --> 03:00:25.396
(hissing)

03:00:27.474 --> 03:00:31.251
And the floor of the room next to you begins to curl open.

03:00:31.251 --> 03:00:35.651
And a tunnel begins to reveal itself downward,

03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:38.155
willed into existence.

03:00:38.155 --> 03:00:40.800
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:41.840
Okay, I love this place.

03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:43.808
LAURA: That's really cool.
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:00:43.808 --> 03:00:45.440
TRAVIS: Does it also taste salty?

03:00:45.440 --> 03:00:47.651
LAURA: Ew.
MARISHA: Does it?

03:00:47.651 --> 03:00:49.658
MATT: This one, no, weirdly.

03:00:49.658 --> 03:00:51.570
MARISHA: So, it's just a tunnel, like it looks

03:00:51.570 --> 03:00:53.643
like a water slide?
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:00:53.643 --> 03:00:57.410
MATT: It's about six, six and a half feet tall.

03:00:57.410 --> 03:00:58.450
So some of you may have to duck down,

03:00:58.450 --> 03:01:01.150
but it is traversable, walkable.

03:01:01.150 --> 03:01:04.190
It's cylindrical, and it looks, yeah,

03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:06.390
it looks mostly smooth, but the texture

03:01:06.390 --> 03:01:07.653
is somewhat striated in places.

03:01:07.653 --> 03:01:09.236
It is like a--

03:01:09.236 --> 03:01:10.069
LIAM: Sphincter.
MATT: Yep.

03:01:10.069 --> 03:01:11.440
MARISHA: Yep!

03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:12.630
TRAVIS: We are in the colon.

03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:15.291
MARISHA: Into, yeah.
TALIESIN: Not our first time.

03:01:15.291 --> 03:01:17.177
TRAVIS: You're right, it is not the first time.

03:01:17.177 --> 03:01:18.143
MATT: No, we're talking--

03:01:18.143 --> 03:01:19.400
TALIESIN: Back to campaign one.

03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:21.550
MATT: The image I keep getting when I'm coming to this

03:01:21.550 --> 03:01:24.252
is the other side in Poltergeist.

03:01:24.252 --> 03:01:25.496
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah.

03:01:25.496 --> 03:01:27.675
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes.
MARISHA: Cool. Okay.

03:01:27.675 --> 03:01:29.550
TRAVIS: Pink and white with goo everywhere.

03:01:29.550 --> 03:01:31.385
LIAM: Just be gentle, doc.

03:01:31.385 --> 03:01:34.070
(laughter)

03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:35.689
LAURA: Should we go?
ASHLEY: Is there a way in?

03:01:35.689 --> 03:01:36.522
LAURA: Let's go?

03:01:36.522 --> 03:01:38.263
TALIESIN: Let's go.
MARISHA: And hope this leads--

03:01:38.263 --> 03:01:39.929
LIAM: Do I have residual--
MARISHA: -- where we want to go.

03:01:39.929 --> 03:01:41.272
LIAM: -- heebie-jeebies

03:01:41.272 --> 03:01:43.230
from something opening?
LAURA: I hop down into the tunnel.

03:01:43.230 --> 03:01:45.949
MATT: There's like a faint tickle.

03:01:45.949 --> 03:01:47.820
TRAVIS: Oh, you got another one!

03:01:48.770 --> 03:01:50.220
LAURA: You got another eye?

03:01:50.220 --> 03:01:51.684
MARISHA: Did he get another eye?

03:01:51.684 --> 03:01:52.517
LIAM: Do you see anything?

03:01:52.517 --> 03:01:54.650
MARISHA: I-- do we?

03:01:54.650 --> 03:01:56.237
MATT: Not plainly on him at the moment.

03:01:56.237 --> 03:01:57.458
TALIESIN: Where was the tickle?
ASHLEY: Take off your clothes.

03:01:57.458 --> 03:01:58.926
MARISHA: Take off your shirt.

03:01:58.926 --> 03:01:59.759
(sighing)

03:01:59.759 --> 03:02:00.834
SAM: Show us your butthole.

03:02:00.834 --> 03:02:01.860
(laughter)

03:02:01.860 --> 03:02:04.529
LAURA: I'm already in the tunnel. Coming?

03:02:04.529 --> 03:02:07.306
TRAVIS: Spread your cheeks and cough.

03:02:07.306 --> 03:02:08.415
LIAM: Nobody tugboat.

03:02:08.415 --> 03:02:09.833
TRAVIS: You never been to county before?

03:02:09.833 --> 03:02:11.479
(laughter)

03:02:11.479 --> 03:02:14.199
LIAM: I will spend a minute looking around.

03:02:14.199 --> 03:02:15.582
MATT: Right over the heart.

03:02:15.582 --> 03:02:16.578
LAURA: Is there one on his ankle?

03:02:16.578 --> 03:02:17.874
LIAM: Right over the heart?

03:02:17.874 --> 03:02:19.540
TRAVIS: Right over your heart.
MATT: The fourth eye.

03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:21.743
TRAVIS: Ooh!
MARISHA: Shit, Caleb.

03:02:23.460 --> 03:02:24.410
Shit.

03:02:24.410 --> 03:02:28.642
LIAM: Do I see anything different than I did before?

03:02:28.642 --> 03:02:29.475
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

03:02:29.475 --> 03:02:31.016
MATT: Not at the moment.
LIAM: Not at the moment, okay.

03:02:31.016 --> 03:02:32.241
TRAVIS: DM, can I ask a question?

03:02:32.241 --> 03:02:33.074
MATT: Yeah.

03:02:33.074 --> 03:02:34.740
TRAVIS: You said that the eyes lit up on Cree

03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:36.890
before she transformed into that thing.

03:02:36.890 --> 03:02:38.980
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Did you say how many eyes lit up?

03:02:38.980 --> 03:02:40.475
MATT and LIAM: Five.
SAM: She had five.

03:02:40.475 --> 03:02:42.335
LIAM: So I'm one shy of a flesh monster.

03:02:43.874 --> 03:02:45.883
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughs)

03:02:45.883 --> 03:02:47.274
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.
SAM: Oh man.

03:02:47.274 --> 03:02:48.390
TRAVIS: That's what I thought.

03:02:48.390 --> 03:02:50.450
LIAM: Boy, man.
MARISHA: Who knows if five was the limit?

03:02:50.450 --> 03:02:53.520
LIAM: I picked one 8th-level spell.

03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:55.580
Let's hope it does something.

03:02:55.580 --> 03:02:56.538
Roll those dice.

03:02:56.538 --> 03:03:00.642
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:03:00.642 --> 03:03:01.880
I love it.

03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:02.938
LIAM: So do I.

03:03:02.938 --> 03:03:05.510
MARISHA: All right, we go into the sphincter.

03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:06.843
MATT: All right.

03:03:09.556 --> 03:03:10.866
MARISHA: I'm sweating.

03:03:10.866 --> 03:03:11.906
A lot.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:03:11.906 --> 03:03:13.257
TALIESIN: I'm vibrating.

03:03:13.257 --> 03:03:16.366
LIAM: Not trying to pick two, but I did not prep the other.

03:03:16.366 --> 03:03:18.056
I couldn't use it if I wanted to.

03:03:18.056 --> 03:03:21.086
MATT: You traverse deeper and deeper,

03:03:21.086 --> 03:03:24.616
within the steady decline of this tunnel.

03:03:24.616 --> 03:03:28.296
The willed focus of Beauregard

03:03:28.296 --> 03:03:31.426
does not leave you to weaving oddly.

03:03:31.426 --> 03:03:33.369
It is a direct channel.

03:03:34.786 --> 03:03:36.161
Lightless as it may be.

03:03:39.056 --> 03:03:40.269
You continue down,

03:03:42.206 --> 03:03:43.039
down,

03:03:44.456 --> 03:03:45.289
down,

03:03:48.166 --> 03:03:52.219
until deep within these twitching corridors,

03:03:54.086 --> 03:03:56.273
under the streets of Cognouza,

03:03:56.273 --> 03:04:00.729
it begins to widen into walls that are

03:04:03.076 --> 03:04:06.029
showing semblances of city once more.

03:04:07.966 --> 03:04:08.999
Bits of stone,

03:04:11.206 --> 03:04:13.909
sections of wall, cracked brick,

03:04:15.276 --> 03:04:17.416
occasionally an eye opens,

03:04:17.416 --> 03:04:19.766
and watches you as you pass, before

03:04:19.766 --> 03:04:21.459
vanishing into the space.

03:04:23.886 --> 03:04:27.386
You've occasionally seen bits of bone or teeth.

03:04:27.386 --> 03:04:31.416
Now these become horns and fang-like protrusions,

03:04:31.416 --> 03:04:32.989
like tusks in places.

03:04:34.986 --> 03:04:36.759
It seems like the deeper you go,

03:04:38.016 --> 03:04:41.356
the harder it is keeping together

03:04:41.356 --> 03:04:43.459
the idea of what it's supposed to be.

03:04:44.516 --> 03:04:48.506
And some of the shapes begin to just become wild and weird,

03:04:48.506 --> 03:04:51.036
more so than the rest of the city,

03:04:51.036 --> 03:04:52.386
I guess you'd say.

03:04:56.486 --> 03:05:00.977
Passing beyond this nightmare
patchwork of architectural memory,

03:05:03.646 --> 03:05:07.249
odd angles begin to twist as it grows taller.

03:05:10.526 --> 03:05:12.594
And then eventually you see a light.

03:05:15.826 --> 03:05:18.876
Continuing on the light gets brighter and brighter.

03:05:18.876 --> 03:05:21.776
This pulsing red light.

03:05:25.056 --> 03:05:29.719
The tunnel begins to give way into a massive chamber.

03:05:31.026 --> 03:05:32.969
An aorta-like chamber.

03:05:33.896 --> 03:05:36.399
The center of the city.

03:05:38.456 --> 03:05:39.496
There are bits of rock,

03:05:39.496 --> 03:05:44.496
and faintly emerging tower structures,

03:05:44.686 --> 03:05:46.431
sections of building.

03:05:47.766 --> 03:05:50.319
But nonsensical in placement,

03:05:53.781 --> 03:05:56.386
like an off-hand sketch of something you saw once

03:05:56.386 --> 03:05:57.526
that is completely wrong,

03:05:57.526 --> 03:06:00.326
but just enough to recognize what it was supposed to be.

03:06:02.216 --> 03:06:06.406
In the middle of it you see this column,

03:06:06.406 --> 03:06:08.599
and within column is this...

03:06:12.296 --> 03:06:14.546
for lack of a better term,

03:06:14.546 --> 03:06:17.956
a bulbous collection

03:06:17.956 --> 03:06:22.098
of massive, faintly glowing

03:06:22.098 --> 03:06:23.523
pulsating orbs,

03:06:25.016 --> 03:06:27.119
all mashed like a nest.

03:06:29.596 --> 03:06:30.704
LIAM: Nine of them?

03:06:32.416 --> 03:06:34.016
MATT: Looks to be about nine, probably.

03:06:34.016 --> 03:06:35.966
If you could see it from all sides.

03:06:42.726 --> 03:06:44.202
LAURA: How tall is the tower?

03:06:45.406 --> 03:06:47.448
MATT: To the ceiling, it's about 80 feet.

03:06:47.448 --> 03:06:50.566
LAURA: The thing is all filling the--?

03:06:50.566 --> 03:06:52.666
MATT: The column-- what you see,

03:06:52.666 --> 03:06:54.566
the central section where these are affixed

03:06:54.566 --> 03:06:56.226
is towards the base,

03:06:56.226 --> 03:06:57.906
and the part that's tethered to the top

03:06:57.906 --> 03:07:02.006
are like stretched tendon and things that are essentially

03:07:02.006 --> 03:07:03.516
connecting it to the center

03:07:03.516 --> 03:07:07.169
and giving it more firm power at its base.

03:07:08.616 --> 03:07:10.326
LIAM: Any sign of the Nonagon?

03:07:10.326 --> 03:07:11.536
MARISHA: That's-- yeah.

03:07:11.536 --> 03:07:13.246
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:07:13.246 --> 03:07:15.738
TRAVIS: Aortic valve.

03:07:15.738 --> 03:07:18.388
MARISHA: The central nervous system.

03:07:18.388 --> 03:07:19.762
LIAM: 19.

03:07:19.762 --> 03:07:20.917
MATT: 19.

03:07:24.436 --> 03:07:26.041
You glance around,

03:07:30.236 --> 03:07:32.436
and you see no sign of the Nonagon.

03:07:35.068 --> 03:07:36.696
What you do see

03:07:39.188 --> 03:07:43.979
is different fluctuating

03:07:43.979 --> 03:07:45.537
points of red light kind of

03:07:47.704 --> 03:07:51.006
heading down these tendrils

03:07:51.006 --> 03:07:52.126
to the center.

03:07:52.126 --> 03:07:55.794
And these orbs begin to alight as they do.

03:07:57.599 --> 03:07:59.649
Quick to gather that these are likely the

03:08:01.207 --> 03:08:04.652
various Somnovem returning

03:08:06.026 --> 03:08:09.379
to greet whoever has stepped into the central chamber.

03:08:09.379 --> 03:08:10.504
LAURA: Oh.

03:08:13.836 --> 03:08:18.459
MATT: A voice immediately fills your minds,

03:08:20.016 --> 03:08:24.834
bassy and commanding.

03:08:27.566 --> 03:08:31.267
"We are the Somnovem

03:08:32.426 --> 03:08:35.756

"how to manifest them."

03:09:29.610 --> 03:09:32.960
LIAM: What is it-- I think--

03:09:34.633 --> 03:09:38.023
that <i>you</i> all want?

03:09:42.906 --> 03:09:44.347
MATT: "Dreams

03:09:46.359 --> 03:09:51.271
"are the mind testing its limits,

03:09:53.866 --> 03:09:55.394
"reaching out

03:09:56.376 --> 03:09:58.522
"and expanding the will.

"with awakened will.

"to a short-lived vessel

"and collected

MARISHA: Who are we speaking to now?

03:12:47.329 --> 03:12:48.279
MATT: "Us.

"All of us.

"We are the Somnovem Omega."

LAURA: So you all get along now?

03:12:58.477 --> 03:13:00.332
MARISHA: (whispers) Somnovem Omega.

03:13:03.966 --> 03:13:05.716
MATT: There's no response.

03:13:07.976 --> 03:13:09.226
TRAVIS: Aren't you missing one?

03:13:12.628 --> 03:13:14.003
MATT: "Yes.

03:13:17.046 --> 03:13:18.679
"Our harbinger,

03:13:20.188 --> 03:13:21.730
"the Nonagon.

"We sense your connection.

"Would you

03:13:34.513 --> 03:13:36.394
"bring him to us?

03:13:36.394 --> 03:13:40.119
"He is beyond our sight."

03:13:41.006 --> 03:13:43.619
LIAM: This ninth is your foothold

03:13:44.716 --> 03:13:46.141
to other shores?

03:13:49.896 --> 03:13:51.121
MATT: "For now."

03:13:55.466 --> 03:13:56.979
LAURA: And he's hiding from you?

03:13:59.477 --> 03:14:01.835
MATT: You see some of the color

03:14:01.835 --> 03:14:06.386
and the light and some of these mass orbs,

03:14:06.386 --> 03:14:11.136
this conjunction of entities shifts colors,

03:14:11.136 --> 03:14:15.170
like a moment of confusion
and turmoil visible on the surface.

03:14:16.976 --> 03:14:17.989
"Strange.

03:14:18.851 --> 03:14:19.909
"Yes."

03:14:24.116 --> 03:14:26.116
LAURA: I wonder what his motive must be?

03:14:29.906 --> 03:14:32.306
MATT: "He is...

03:14:33.939 --> 03:14:35.905
"with us.

"We felt him arrive.

"Nine of us await...

"the Nonagon."

03:14:50.416 --> 03:14:53.079
MARISHA: "The nine of us await the Nonagon?"

03:14:55.461 --> 03:14:58.036
LIAM: The math doesn't seem to add up.

03:14:58.036 --> 03:14:59.339
LAURA: Maybe he's the tenth.

03:14:59.339 --> 03:15:00.906
MARISHA: He's the tenth.
LAURA: We just haven't--

03:15:02.486 --> 03:15:03.477
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:15:07.556 --> 03:15:10.189
SAM: When the Nonagon rejoins you,

03:15:11.446 --> 03:15:14.509
will you all go somewhere together,

03:15:15.366 --> 03:15:17.376
or are you content here?

03:15:17.376 --> 03:15:21.101
MATT: "He is to bring the key

03:15:21.101 --> 03:15:23.301
"and open the door."

03:15:26.516 --> 03:15:28.241
SAM: And if he does not?

03:15:29.646 --> 03:15:32.179
MATT: The colors roil and flash.

03:15:35.618 --> 03:15:38.974
"Then we will find another way."

03:15:38.974 --> 03:15:41.126
LIAM: Then you don't know where he is.

03:15:41.126 --> 03:15:45.286
If you did, you could point us toward him,

03:15:45.286 --> 03:15:47.319
and we could find him for you.

03:15:48.546 --> 03:15:51.916
MATT: In a brief moment, you feel this storm of energy

03:15:51.916 --> 03:15:53.596
reach out.

03:15:53.596 --> 03:15:55.956
Each of you that has an eye,

03:15:55.956 --> 03:15:59.406
you feel a part of your body begin to grow cold

03:15:59.406 --> 03:16:01.286
where that eye is,

03:16:01.286 --> 03:16:04.889
as if something is peering through and searching you,

03:16:08.254 --> 03:16:09.354
and then it withdraws.

03:16:11.346 --> 03:16:12.179
"Yes.

03:16:13.666 --> 03:16:16.786
"You have sought him as well.

03:16:18.494 --> 03:16:20.944
"Find him for us.

03:16:25.588 --> 03:16:26.529
"Then

03:16:28.495 --> 03:16:31.215
"all that you've ever dreamed

03:16:31.215 --> 03:16:35.149
"will be yours."

03:16:36.866 --> 03:16:38.166
LIAM: We will do this for you.

03:16:40.376 --> 03:16:43.296
We will bring the Nonagon,

03:16:43.296 --> 03:16:44.842
to his close.

03:16:49.246 --> 03:16:51.086
LAURA: Just be careful because

03:16:51.086 --> 03:16:53.611
he was talking about ultimate power, and...

03:16:54.761 --> 03:16:55.766
I don't know, maybe he's hiding

03:16:55.766 --> 03:17:00.382
because he wants more than what you offered.

03:17:09.526 --> 03:17:10.593
MATT: There's a pause.

03:17:21.706 --> 03:17:25.796
Echoing from elsewhere in the chamber.

03:17:32.196 --> 03:17:33.588
(as Lucien) "Well, I'm glad you came."

03:17:34.653 --> 03:17:37.211
TRAVIS: (wheezy laugh)

03:17:39.803 --> 03:17:41.428
MATT: "The invitation was there

03:17:42.676 --> 03:17:47.637
"and you've all proven exactly as useful as I hoped."

03:17:50.486 --> 03:17:51.616
The colors shift,

03:17:51.616 --> 03:17:56.616
and you see the central column begins to warp slightly.

03:17:58.666 --> 03:18:01.936
And on the opposite side of where you're standing,

03:18:01.936 --> 03:18:04.436
near one of the other aortic tunnels

03:18:04.436 --> 03:18:05.972
that ventures past there,

03:18:09.006 --> 03:18:10.056
you see Lucien

03:18:11.816 --> 03:18:15.976
standing next to an empty sack

03:18:18.264 --> 03:18:22.423
and a cluster of nine or 10

03:18:22.423 --> 03:18:25.206
glowing intuit charges,

03:18:27.376 --> 03:18:32.309
all pooled into one pulsing pile.

03:18:35.646 --> 03:18:36.896
"I needed them distracted.

03:18:39.496 --> 03:18:41.072
"Keep their eyes off me for a bit."

03:18:41.072 --> 03:18:43.130
SAM: (gasps) Oh no.

03:18:44.366 --> 03:18:46.303
MATT: "So I thank you for that."

03:18:48.446 --> 03:18:53.438
The Somnovem voice begins to echo through all of your minds,

03:18:53.438 --> 03:18:54.379
The Somnovem voice begins to echo through all of your minds,

03:18:54.379 --> 03:18:56.436
like a storm of lightning.

03:18:56.436 --> 03:19:00.119
"Stop him, stop, stop, stop him, stop--"

03:19:00.119 --> 03:19:04.673
And Lucien goes, "Enough of that!

03:19:05.565 --> 03:19:09.801
"(laughs) You all know very well with this is,

03:19:10.746 --> 03:19:11.926
"and I'm glad we've all synchronized

03:19:11.926 --> 03:19:14.859
"our schedules through all this chaos.

03:19:15.736 --> 03:19:16.569
"It's perfect.

03:19:18.266 --> 03:19:22.126
"These people, this city, tragic in its fall.

03:19:22.126 --> 03:19:24.919
"Yes, but glorious in its discoveries.

03:19:27.006 --> 03:19:28.776
"The Somnovem had studied to prepare it enough

03:19:28.776 --> 03:19:31.757
"to harness their terrible fate, and in doing so--"

03:19:31.757 --> 03:19:33.016
And he snaps his fingers.

03:19:33.016 --> 03:19:34.366
And you watch as the flesh around him

03:19:34.366 --> 03:19:36.916
forms a chair behind him.

03:19:36.916 --> 03:19:38.366
A throne, if you will.

03:19:38.366 --> 03:19:40.041
And he leans into it.

03:19:44.426 --> 03:19:45.766
"They were reborn greater

03:19:45.766 --> 03:19:47.666
"than they could have ever anticipated.

03:19:48.516 --> 03:19:49.824
"Isn't that right?

03:19:51.116 --> 03:19:53.766
"Power of a thousand minds, dreams,

03:19:53.766 --> 03:19:58.646
"imaginations, and wills made one.

03:19:58.646 --> 03:20:01.249
"Founded in the aether of manifestation,

03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:05.516
"a miracle, unstoppable.

03:20:07.436 --> 03:20:09.849
"Yet rudderless,

03:20:11.366 --> 03:20:12.199
"fractured,

03:20:13.066 --> 03:20:13.899
"wild,

03:20:15.156 --> 03:20:16.289
"jealous,

03:20:18.986 --> 03:20:20.019
"impotent."

03:20:21.536 --> 03:20:23.346
The colors flicker intensely

03:20:23.346 --> 03:20:26.056
and you can see elements of psychic energy

03:20:26.056 --> 03:20:29.956
trying to begin to spark out of the center column upward,

03:20:29.956 --> 03:20:32.796
but it's also holding back.

03:20:35.976 --> 03:20:38.569
You recognize the stalemate between the two sides.

03:20:41.056 --> 03:20:42.309
"I once saw them as gods.

03:20:43.806 --> 03:20:46.056
"Being so far beyond my ability to understand.

03:20:46.916 --> 03:20:50.479
"And they chose <i>me</i> to be their herald.

03:20:52.708 --> 03:20:56.946
"But when I died,

03:20:56.946 --> 03:20:58.176
"when I scattered,

03:20:59.986 --> 03:21:01.196
"and they put me back together,

03:21:01.196 --> 03:21:04.297
"I was given a view behind the curtain

03:21:05.974 --> 03:21:07.649
"and I saw the fallacy.

03:21:08.796 --> 03:21:13.796
"I had given everything for genius souls.

03:21:14.496 --> 03:21:17.820
"Now mewling toddlers

03:21:17.820 --> 03:21:20.561
"bickering over the power of creation.

03:21:22.906 --> 03:21:25.376
"Someone needed to be the parent.

03:21:28.196 --> 03:21:30.676
"When children have been acting out, well,

03:21:30.676 --> 03:21:32.359
"making a mess of their potential,

03:21:33.236 --> 03:21:34.759
"for this long even,

03:21:35.996 --> 03:21:39.216
"a responsible caretaker must show discipline,

03:21:41.136 --> 03:21:42.444
"enact a punishment,

03:21:44.026 --> 03:21:45.526
"and take the reins with force.

03:21:47.036 --> 03:21:51.049
"So I invite you to stay for the show,

03:21:52.975 --> 03:21:55.435
"but I think you'd prefer to run."

03:21:58.676 --> 03:22:01.546
He leans back and puts his hand on the devices,

03:22:01.546 --> 03:22:06.546
as they begin to blink faster and faster.

03:22:06.616 --> 03:22:09.056
MARISHA: We got to go.
TRAVIS: How far away is he?

03:22:09.056 --> 03:22:10.936
MATT: He's about 120, 130 feet from you.

03:22:10.936 --> 03:22:13.436
On the other side of this chamber.

03:22:13.436 --> 03:22:14.699
MARISHA: Wait--
LAURA: I'm going to--

03:22:16.003 --> 03:22:17.106
LIAM: How many feet?

03:22:17.106 --> 03:22:18.036
TRAVIS: 120.

03:22:18.036 --> 03:22:19.264
LAURA: I'm going to say, "Run."

03:22:19.264 --> 03:22:22.146
And I'm going to cast Earthquake right under him.

03:22:22.146 --> 03:22:23.406
MATT: Cast Earthquake right under him?

03:22:23.406 --> 03:22:25.029
LAURA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Okay.

03:22:25.029 --> 03:22:27.956
SAM: I'm going to cast Intellect Fortress on myself,

03:22:27.956 --> 03:22:29.046
and start running.

03:22:29.046 --> 03:22:30.286
MATT: Okay.

03:22:30.286 --> 03:22:32.516
So Jester and Veth start running back

03:22:32.516 --> 03:22:34.053
through the tunnel you guys came from.

03:22:34.053 --> 03:22:35.043
MARISHA: I'm going to haul ass, too.

03:22:35.043 --> 03:22:36.486
There's nothing I can do.
TALIESIN: I'm going to run that way,

03:22:36.486 --> 03:22:37.986
and say: Everyone with me.

03:22:37.986 --> 03:22:40.766
And I'm also-- I'm going to cast-- fuck it.

03:22:40.766 --> 03:22:43.806
I'm casting-- where did it go?

03:22:43.806 --> 03:22:45.086
Why won't you-- hold on.

03:22:45.086 --> 03:22:46.816
It's doing that thing where it--

03:22:46.816 --> 03:22:48.816
Antimagic Field.

03:22:48.816 --> 03:22:50.276
MATT: Okay.

03:22:50.276 --> 03:22:51.916
You all begin to run.

03:22:51.916 --> 03:22:52.916
Everyone else following suit?

03:22:52.916 --> 03:22:53.966
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:22:53.966 --> 03:22:56.196
MATT: Running back through the tunnel where you came from,

03:22:56.196 --> 03:22:59.716
the ground beginning to crack,

03:22:59.716 --> 03:23:01.417
the elements that are stone

03:23:01.417 --> 03:23:04.426
and the parts that are flesh begin to shake and roil.

03:23:04.426 --> 03:23:06.316
You watch as the tethers above

03:23:06.316 --> 03:23:08.636
that attach to this central part,

03:23:08.636 --> 03:23:12.583
the Aether Crux itself, begin to (snap)

03:23:12.583 --> 03:23:13.599
(creak, ting)

03:23:13.599 --> 03:23:15.183
Like cables being snapped,

03:23:15.183 --> 03:23:16.516
parts are beginning to fall.

03:23:16.516 --> 03:23:18.376
Elements of the ceiling begin to crash down,

03:23:18.376 --> 03:23:20.026
like it's trying to physically attack

03:23:20.026 --> 03:23:24.246
with the full flesh of Cognouza itself upon Lucien,

03:23:24.246 --> 03:23:28.645
who begins laughing and laughing, just

03:23:28.645 --> 03:23:31.395
(laughs)

03:23:31.395 --> 03:23:34.928
(maniacal laughter)

03:23:34.928 --> 03:23:38.403
(shrieks of laughter)

03:23:40.496 --> 03:23:44.989
As you all run and run and run,

03:23:46.603 --> 03:23:50.285
(dull explosions)

03:23:50.285 --> 03:23:52.285
a series of flashes behind you.

03:23:53.606 --> 03:23:57.101
And you feel, especially you who's connected to this city,

03:23:59.516 --> 03:24:04.324
you feel the flex and the scream

03:24:04.324 --> 03:24:06.232
and the tensing

03:24:06.232 --> 03:24:08.999
of the entirety of Cognouza at once

03:24:12.036 --> 03:24:16.296
as its nerve center, the Somnovem

03:24:16.296 --> 03:24:20.387
that brought it together, are bombarded.

03:24:24.069 --> 03:24:26.968
And as you all fall to the ground,

03:24:28.043 --> 03:24:31.001
breathing deeply.

03:24:32.326 --> 03:24:33.849
In the ensuing silence.

03:24:36.286 --> 03:24:37.236
There's just quiet.

03:24:38.746 --> 03:24:39.579
No laughter,

03:24:41.816 --> 03:24:42.724
no sound.

03:24:46.536 --> 03:24:47.703
Just the eight of you.

03:24:51.766 --> 03:24:52.907
That's where we're going to end tonight's episode.

03:24:52.907 --> 03:24:57.474
(nervous sighs)

03:24:57.474 --> 03:24:58.831
LAURA: What does that mean?

03:24:58.831 --> 03:24:59.739
SAM: How does he--?

03:25:00.726 --> 03:25:03.826
TALIESIN: We are <i>so</i> fucked.
LIAM: We don't know.

03:25:03.826 --> 03:25:05.186
TRAVIS: If there were-- yeah.

03:25:05.186 --> 03:25:08.452
If there were nine entities controlling a living city,

03:25:08.452 --> 03:25:11.061
and now there's only one.

03:25:12.586 --> 03:25:14.686
Maybe-- I don't know.

03:25:14.686 --> 03:25:16.856
TALIESIN: Or at least there's going to be a fight about it.

03:25:16.856 --> 03:25:19.996
TRAVIS: I missed the first 45 seconds
of what you were saying,

03:25:19.996 --> 03:25:21.476
because I was just trying to figure out

03:25:21.476 --> 03:25:22.866
what we could do to get to him.

03:25:22.866 --> 03:25:24.746
And there was nothing.
MARISHA: There's nothing.

03:25:24.746 --> 03:25:26.706
ASHLEY: Wait, so we don't have ninth name,

03:25:26.706 --> 03:25:28.236
or Nonagon the 10th?
TALIESIN: I don't think

03:25:28.236 --> 03:25:29.536
it matters any more.
ASHLEY: It doesn't matter.

03:25:29.536 --> 03:25:30.566
Nothing matters.

03:25:30.566 --> 03:25:32.256
MARISHA: Apparently, Nonagon is the harbinger,

03:25:32.256 --> 03:25:34.330
so we are missing a name.

03:25:34.330 --> 03:25:35.736
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay.

03:25:35.736 --> 03:25:38.831
TRAVIS: I think Lucien is the harbinger.

03:25:38.831 --> 03:25:40.496
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:25:40.496 --> 03:25:41.506
LIAM: I wasn't saying anything

03:25:41.506 --> 03:25:44.536
because I'm currently immune to psychic damage,

03:25:44.536 --> 03:25:47.506
and I was so tempted to fly straight at him,

03:25:47.506 --> 03:25:49.556
but I'm not immune to things

03:25:49.556 --> 03:25:50.975
collapsing on me.
TRAVIS: No.

03:25:50.975 --> 03:25:52.746
LAURA: Oh sorry.
LIAM: So I was just like--

03:25:52.746 --> 03:25:53.579
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Same.

03:25:53.579 --> 03:25:56.136
MATT: But the earthquake. (laughs)

03:25:56.136 --> 03:25:58.453
LAURA: Oh sorry, I was trying to take him out.

03:25:58.453 --> 03:25:59.316
LIAM: Do what you got to do.
MATT: It's all good.

03:25:59.316 --> 03:26:01.328
TRAVIS: I thought about putting
Arcane Gate right behind him,

03:26:01.328 --> 03:26:04.301
and just pushing all of the intuit charges,

03:26:04.301 --> 03:26:05.446
getting 500 feet away.

03:26:05.446 --> 03:26:08.118
But that would-- I wouldn't make it there in time.

03:26:08.118 --> 03:26:11.739
LIAM: And if he set it off, all of our friends are in range.

03:26:11.739 --> 03:26:13.346
It doesn't matter that I'm immune,

03:26:13.346 --> 03:26:14.179
all of you would die.

03:26:14.179 --> 03:26:16.537
TALIESIN: I've got a 10-foot barrier right now,

03:26:16.537 --> 03:26:19.609
where very little, except for--
TRAVIS: It went off.

03:26:19.609 --> 03:26:20.766
So we're good.
LAURA: Yeah,

03:26:20.766 --> 03:26:22.200
all the charges went off.

03:26:22.200 --> 03:26:24.006
MARISHA: My first thought was

03:26:24.006 --> 03:26:26.906
maybe wish that all the intuit charges

03:26:26.906 --> 03:26:29.156
were rubber ducks or something.

03:26:29.156 --> 03:26:30.666
I don't know, but I didn't.

03:26:30.666 --> 03:26:31.963
TRAVIS: It got real bad,

03:26:31.963 --> 03:26:33.236
and then it got better.

03:26:33.236 --> 03:26:34.756
And now I can't tell if it's worse or not.

03:26:34.756 --> 03:26:35.946
I thought for a moment there,

03:26:35.946 --> 03:26:38.049
we were going to be fighting Lucien

03:26:38.049 --> 03:26:39.909
and nine entities

03:26:40.936 --> 03:26:42.749
in a lair action situation.

03:26:42.749 --> 03:26:45.269
And now I don't know where we are.

03:26:46.376 --> 03:26:48.196
TALIESIN: Nine entities that don't like each other.

03:26:48.196 --> 03:26:50.628
Now we just have one that really likes themselves.

03:26:50.628 --> 03:26:53.963
LAURA: And has everything we're standing on,

03:26:53.963 --> 03:26:55.206
is trying to attack us.

03:26:55.206 --> 03:26:57.336
MARISHA: And I can't shake the fact that we're eight

03:26:57.336 --> 03:26:59.243
and Lucien makes nine.

03:26:59.243 --> 03:27:00.864
LAURA: (laughs)

03:27:00.864 --> 03:27:03.406
TALIESIN: This whole game is so ridiculous.
MATT: This whole fucking campaign.

03:27:03.406 --> 03:27:04.322
MARISHA: Patterns, fractals,

03:27:04.322 --> 03:27:06.816
fractals, patterns, patterns, fractals.

03:27:06.816 --> 03:27:08.207
LIAM: The Mighty Nein.

03:27:08.207 --> 03:27:09.616
MATT: Well, we're going to go ahead

03:27:09.616 --> 03:27:14.616
and pick this up here next time.

03:27:15.004 --> 03:27:16.856
Thank you all so much for joining us.

03:27:16.856 --> 03:27:20.593
TRAVIS: No! No, you can't do this!
MARISHA: (screams)

03:27:20.593 --> 03:27:21.766
What does it mean?!

03:27:21.766 --> 03:27:22.776
MATT: We love you very much.

03:27:22.776 --> 03:27:23.801
TRAVIS: No, we got to keep playing!

03:27:23.801 --> 03:27:25.642
MATT: And--
ASHLEY: We have to keep playing, right now!

03:27:25.642 --> 03:27:27.575
(laughter)

03:27:27.575 --> 03:27:28.750
MATT: Is it Thursday yet?

03:27:28.750 --> 03:27:29.666
(groaning and yelling)

03:27:29.666 --> 03:27:31.119
Good night.

03:27:31.119 --> 03:27:32.760
ASHLEY: I'm not done playing yet!

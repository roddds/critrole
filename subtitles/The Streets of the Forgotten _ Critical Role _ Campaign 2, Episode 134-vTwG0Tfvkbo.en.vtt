MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.089
to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.509
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.231
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:09.169
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.160
MATT: Indeed.

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:11.659
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.109
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.359
beginning with our first sponsor for the night,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.569
our returning sponsor actually, NordVPN.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.553
Sam, take it away.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.003
Sam?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.673
Sam?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.809
Right, right, right. Okay.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.209
Long story, but Sam was actually

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.969
a level 20 hack master known as BlackWillow69@aol.com,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.220
And, well...

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.369
MARISHA: He always used NordVPN

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.539
for the highest-quality encryption for internet traffic.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.423
And it hides your IP and physical location,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.083
with more than 5,400 servers in 59 countries.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.419
I mean, it's easy to get better speed

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.270
and protection with one simple click.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.529
Poor bastard.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.969
You know, Sam always knew

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.249
that it's available on every platform.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.083
MARISHA: He did.

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:14.759
ASHLEY: Yeah, including Windows, iOS, Android and Linux.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.369
Ly-nux? Linux.
MARISHA: Linux.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.828
ASHLEY: I know computers really well.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.621
MARISHA: Such a good haxxor.

00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:24.362
ASHLEY: (tearfully) He wanted you all to go to

00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:28.904
nordvpn.com/criticalrole

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.119
or use code criticalrole to get a two-year plan

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.889
plus one additional month with a huge 70% discount.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.999
MARISHA: I mean, Sam waged a digital battle

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.113
for the freedom of the Nordiverse,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.881
until someone sliced him

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:54.882
and turned him into a gleaming cube of energy.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.693
MATT: Yeah. Sorry about that.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.744
But where is this spectacular gleaming cube?

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:05.395
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I don't have it.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.829
LIAM: Wait a minute. Travis!

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.663
Are you...

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.493
Are you eating Sam?!

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:14.864
TRAVIS: What?

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:16.997
Oh. My bad.

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:19.100
No, just gleam-- (chokes)

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:23.926
(laughter)

00:02:25.113 --> 00:02:27.649
The gleam cube was made out of cake.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.896
(laughter)

00:02:28.897 --> 00:02:29.730
ASHLEY: What?

00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:31.384
TRAVIS: I thought it was my--

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.519
(laughter)

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.724
LIAM: We're very upset right now.

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:37.169
TRAVIS: Thought it was my birthday.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.729
(laughter)

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.221
MARISHA: But it's not your birthday!

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:43.207
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) I know.

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.072
That's why I thought it was weird.

00:02:45.073 --> 00:02:48.139
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.438
You ate a slice of BlackWil--

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.583
BlackWil--

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.637
I can't even say his login handle.

00:02:55.638 --> 00:02:57.129
MARISHA: Oh, I'm going to barf.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.598
TRAVIS: Laura, are you--

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.432
Are you crying?

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:01.399
LAURA: I'm fine, Travis.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.750
It's not like he was the only man I ever loved.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.719
LIAM: That spirit cube contained 10,000 zetabytes

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.879
of BlackWillow's computer knowledge.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.289
All the Super Meat Boy ciphers,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.209
all the No Man's Sky cheat codes,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.679
every Dharma he ever Gregged.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.513
And now...

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.395
TRAVIS: It's in my belly?

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.979
LIAM: How do you feel?

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.083
TRAVIS: Well, you know, now that you mention it,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.711
I do feel a little woozy.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.745
(electronic distortion)

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:40.407
ASHLEY: What's happening?
LAURA: What?

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:42.733
[upbeat electronic music]

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.239
TRAVIS: Maybe I should just unlink my black water capacitor,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.659
hard target the maximum risk, cyborg the Time Cop

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.555
and kickbox the JCVD.

00:03:55.397 --> 00:03:57.969
MARISHA: Holy Emma Bunton!

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.411
Those were legit computer hacker terms.

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:02.923
But how?

00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:05.999
TRAVIS: What's happening to me?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.989
How do I know all of this,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.229
and how am I surfing the net with my arms?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.304
ASHLEY: By consuming Sam,

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:18.259
you've somehow become leet!

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.499
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.649
Maybe I'll hack into the Domino's servers

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.758
and get us all free pizzas.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.199
ASHLEY: Ooh!

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.999
TALIESIN: Free pizza is the least of your concerns,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.259
young crypto-prodigy.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.619
There's a nano storm coming.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.039
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.229
TALIESIN: A great disturbance in the internet.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.309
I've sensed it, a snitch in our servers,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.759
a ghost in our shell, a robot in our Frank.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.479
Something not of this world.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.579
TRAVIS: Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.414
I'm just a noob.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.597
TALIESIN: No, you are...

00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:54.253
The Two.

00:04:54.254 --> 00:04:55.789
TRAVIS: The-- The Two?
[music abruptly stops]

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.809
TALIESIN: Yeah, like Neo in The Matrix.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.319
TRAVIS: Oh, you mean The One?

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.689
TALIESIN: They did that already, so you're The Two.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.623
Your hacker name is Number Two.

00:05:06.624 --> 00:05:08.475
TRAVIS: I don't want to be The Two.

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:11.389
TALIESIN: (sighing) Sorry, that's the prophecy.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.929
TRAVIS: Well, can't we come up with something else,

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.839
like CyberCowboy69, or I don't know, The Sentinel,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.549
but spelled with all numbers?

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.519
TALIESIN: Listen to me, Number Two.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.659
If you're going to save the mainframe,
[upbeat electronic music]

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.529
you need me to train you.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.713
TRAVIS: You? What's your trainer code name?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.339
TALIESIN: They call me Morpheus.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.049
TRAVIS: What!? You said I couldn't be The One.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.419
TALIESIN: Names aren't important, Number Two,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.416
we need to begin your training.

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:39.549
(laughter)

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.439
TRAVIS: Let me guess, the next time

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.703
NordVPN sponsors our show?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.299
TALIESIN: You're already learning, Number Two.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.484
Matt, hack to you.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.049
(sputtering laughter)

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.144
MATT: Thank you, everyone for that.

00:05:57.145 --> 00:05:58.194
(light applause)

00:05:58.195 --> 00:05:59.919
ASHLEY: Wow.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.950
MATT: Well done, Travis.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.962
That commitment, the commitment.

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:05.796
LIAM: Wow.

00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:09.609
ASHLEY: Who does Number Two work for?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.367
MATT: All I could think of was,

00:06:11.368 --> 00:06:14.699
"Who is Number One? You are Number Six.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.589
"I am not a number, I am a free man!"

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.669
For all you ancient Brit TV appreciators out there.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.210
Thank you, NordVPN,

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:25.827
for sticking around--

00:06:25.828 --> 00:06:27.576
(laughter)

00:06:27.577 --> 00:06:28.410
LIAM: All at once.

00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:30.142
MATT: -- with this deep lore.

00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:32.675
And thank you to our second sponsor for the night,

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:34.833
and all of campaign two, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:36.702
(cheering)

00:06:36.703 --> 00:06:38.609

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.149
to maintain and customize your campaigns

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.979
and create your characters and maintain them

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.229
on an online database.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.479
They have digital dice to use on it.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.329
You can have all of your friends' characters

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.469
in your campaign.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.059

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.959
are shared with everybody in the campaign.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.399
They put them on, it's awesome.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.763

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.590
For the next batch of announcements,

00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:05.229
Marisha, you have some things to discuss.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.729
MARISHA: I do, that's me!

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.129
Thank you so much for joining us live on Twitch and YouTube.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.269
To join our live and moderated chat,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.633
head on over to our Twitch channel.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.363
Yeah.

00:07:17.364 --> 00:07:22.363
Also, hot off the presses, the content presses.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.839
Our newest episode of Crit Recap Animated

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.259
summarizes the Mighty Nein's adventures

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.255
from campaign two, episode nine through episode 16.

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:35.279
LAURA: (impressive belch)
MARISHA: It's out on YouTube. Nice.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.469
Stick around during the break

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.319
if you want to watch the episode.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.319
We're going to air it or go check it out.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.159
Also, I never do this.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.259
So I never ask, go like and comment and share

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.609
Crit Recap Animated, because the YouTube algorithm...

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.228
The YouTube algorithm.

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.009
Next--
(laughter)

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.879
MARISHA: -- is Narrative Telephone is back next week,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.339

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.732
good friend of the
Crit Role team, Aabria Iyengar.

00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:08.463
(cheering)
Joining us.

00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:11.399
Legendary dungeon master, she's awesome.

MARISHA: Content!

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.393
MATT: There you go.

00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:25.245
MARISHA: Done.

00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:26.969
MATT: Thank you, Marisha.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.160
And for our final announcement for tonight,

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:31.789
Ashley Johnson, if you don't mind.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.906
ASHLEY: Ooh, hello!
LIAM: Oh shit!

00:08:34.907 --> 00:08:36.119
TRAVIS: Let's go!

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.719
ASHLEY: So today you may have noticed,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.269
we launched a brand new fundraising campaign

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.636
with our longtime friends, 826 LA.

00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:47.379
(cheering)

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.809
As a quick refresher, for some of you who may not know:

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.949
826 LA is a non-profit organization dedicated

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.529
to sharpening writing skills and unlocking creativity

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.449
in students from underserved areas here in Los Angeles,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.479
and we've been working with these wonderful folks

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.139
over there, since I guess, the very beginning

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.149
of our streams, and we're excited to continue to support

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.129
the wonderful and incredible work that they do.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.949
So here's the nitty gritty.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.739
Together, we hope to build out a writer's room for students

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.740
at Venice High School, which is
a Title I school here in Los Angeles.

00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:31.529
And writer's rooms are crucial areas
in schools that allow students

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.169
to further develop writing skills and seek mentorship

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.769
as they prepare to apply to and head off to college.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.349
This will be 826 LA's third writer's room

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.279
here in Los Angeles and if we are able to hit our goal

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.280
of $150,000, the room will open in spring 2022.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.669
So this is a wonderful opportunity for us

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.759
to join forces for good once again, and

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.569
create a meaningful and long lasting impact in the lives

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.689
of many young people for many years to come.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.006
So head on over to criticalrolefoundation.org

00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:10.479
to learn more and to donate, right now!

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.689
SAM: Do it!
TRAVIS: Woo!

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.449
MARISHA: It is great because today you're dressed

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.298
like a creative writing professor.

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:18.288
(laughter)

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:21.816
TRAVIS: Did you read The Great Gatsby?

00:10:21.817 --> 00:10:25.808
ASHLEY: You can also crochet some sleeves on your-- No.

00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:27.921
TRAVIS: Philip K. Dick is my hero.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.599
MATT: Fantastic. Thank you, Ashley.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.899
And thank you everybody for your amazing support

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.929
of these charitable endeavors and your support now

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.299
of 826 LA and all the incredible work that they do.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.905
So appreciate that.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.110
Without further ado, I think

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.809
that finishes our announcements.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.269
Let's go ahead and jump into

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.363
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.105
(water bubbling)

00:10:57.106 --> 00:10:58.772
(thunder rumbling)

00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:32.087
MATT: And welcome back.

00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:34.787
So last we left off:

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:38.672
The Mighty Nein have trekked back to Eiselcross.

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:42.397
You've conscripted the aid of your longtime ally,

00:12:42.398 --> 00:12:45.525
the Shadowhand, Essek Thelyss,

00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:48.557
to join you into the ruins

00:12:48.558 --> 00:12:52.317
of the ancient magical city of Aeor proper.

00:12:52.318 --> 00:12:55.257
Upon arriving, you inspected some of the space within.

00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:57.438
You set a trap for the Tomb Takers

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:03.368
and successfully managed to ensnare them,

00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:05.268
killing three,

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:09.669
and the only remaining members being Lucien and Cree.

00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:13.037
In this climactic moment, as you rushed in

00:13:13.038 --> 00:13:15.081
to finish them off, once and for all,

00:13:16.178 --> 00:13:20.867
the last trick up their sleeve allowed Cree and Lucien

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:25.597
to escape, shunting themselves past the tunnel

00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:29.507
that you were safeguarding, and collapsing it behind them

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:31.544
via some sort of magical quake.

00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:37.897
You had just finished killing off the remaining members

00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:40.848
of the Tomb Takers that lie there, bleeding and unconscious.

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:46.161
But as you take a moment and watch the dust settle,

00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:51.737
the rumbling fade, and you all look at each other

00:13:51.738 --> 00:13:55.287
in the low light, feeling the immensity wash over you

00:13:55.288 --> 00:14:00.288
of what just transpired, we come into tonight's game.

00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:05.450
So what would you like to do?

00:14:05.451 --> 00:14:08.637
ASHLEY, MARISHA, and LIAM: (sigh)

00:14:08.638 --> 00:14:09.901
MARISHA: Is anyone crazy hurt?

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.227
SAM: Oh god. Oh god.

00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:13.387
MARISHA: Anyone get hit?

00:14:13.388 --> 00:14:14.221
TALIESIN: Anybody?

00:14:14.222 --> 00:14:17.170
LAURA: I mean, I'm still hurt from the frost giants.

00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:18.312
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:14:20.398 --> 00:14:21.877
SAM: They <i>just</i> got away, right?

00:14:21.878 --> 00:14:22.917
LAURA: They <i>just</i> got away.

00:14:22.918 --> 00:14:24.921
The rubble is is literally in front of us right now.

00:14:24.922 --> 00:14:26.217
SAM: Should we pursue or anything?

00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:27.507
LAURA: I mean, we should probably get

00:14:27.508 --> 00:14:29.987
all these rocks out of the way or something.

00:14:29.988 --> 00:14:31.547
TRAVIS: I'm sorry I didn't wake you up sooner.

00:14:31.548 --> 00:14:34.537
I was hoping that we would have more time for a rest,

00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:38.177
but they were on us, and I chose to let you sleep,

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:40.337
I'm sorry.
ASHLEY: It's okay.

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:42.661
SAM: Did the guards warn us?

00:14:42.662 --> 00:14:44.167
TRAVIS: They did.

00:14:44.168 --> 00:14:45.397
SAM: Oh.

00:14:45.398 --> 00:14:47.269
TRAVIS: They communicated with Essek.

00:14:49.578 --> 00:14:51.291
I thought there might be more time.

00:14:52.454 --> 00:14:54.257
LAURA: We needed it.

00:14:54.258 --> 00:14:55.587
TALIESIN: We still need it.

00:14:55.588 --> 00:14:57.431
MARISHA: I know, we're so close.

00:14:57.432 --> 00:14:58.657
TRAVIS: But if we're going to follow them,

00:14:58.658 --> 00:15:01.547
we should try and make up ground, yes?

00:15:01.548 --> 00:15:02.381
LAURA: Yeah.

00:15:02.382 --> 00:15:04.537
MARISHA: It's going to take some time to clear this.

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:09.538
Also, we did just do a heavy number on them as well.

00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:11.217
TALIESIN: I think we call this and take the win.

00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:14.006
Last time we tried this idea of running them down,

00:15:14.007 --> 00:15:15.747
it didn't go well.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.667
TRAVIS: That's true.
LAURA: But what?

00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:18.501
We call this?

00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:20.227
What do you mean?

00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:22.177
TALIESIN: We sleep and we pick up--

00:15:22.178 --> 00:15:25.607
Well, I have an idea. I do have an idea,

00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:26.968
but we need to sleep.
LAURA: Well, then say it!

00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:28.057
LIAM: Yeah.

00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:28.891
TALIESIN: I should show it.

00:15:28.892 --> 00:15:30.387
It's hard to explain.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.245
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: Go for it.

00:15:31.246 --> 00:15:32.625
TALIESIN: But it's--
SAM: Show it?

00:15:32.626 --> 00:15:34.017
TALIESIN: It's in the city.

00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:35.277
It's something I found in the city.

00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:36.977
I have a weird idea.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.397
LAURA: Well, we have to get through the rubble

00:15:38.398 --> 00:15:39.907
in order to get there.

00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:41.437
TALIESIN: Well, we're going to have to-- before we sleep,

00:15:41.438 --> 00:15:43.237
I think we're going to have to get in there,

00:15:43.238 --> 00:15:45.097
because that might be the place.

00:15:45.098 --> 00:15:46.727
LIAM: Are these two on the ground,

00:15:46.728 --> 00:15:49.051
they're breathing? They're dead?

00:15:49.052 --> 00:15:50.817
MATT: If I recall, before we finished last time,

00:15:50.818 --> 00:15:53.675
you finished off the remaining members, yeah.

00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:54.707
LIAM: Okay.

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:56.416
ASHLEY: Is there any--

00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:00.465
maybe any reason why we should

00:16:00.466 --> 00:16:02.397
take one of their heads or anything

00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:03.231
to talk to them later?

00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:04.570
LIAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

00:16:04.571 --> 00:16:05.818
TRAVIS: I think we popped off, well--

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:08.026
ASHLEY: Did we already do this?
TRAVIS: We definitely popped off--

00:16:08.027 --> 00:16:10.397
LIAM: Otis'. It's smaller, it'll travel easier.

00:16:10.398 --> 00:16:11.617
ASHLEY: That's right.

00:16:11.618 --> 00:16:13.277
TRAVIS: The other two, we just dispatched,

00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:14.674
but I don't know if we--

00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:18.430
(laughter)

00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:19.663
TRAVIS: It's the cake. (grunts)

00:16:19.664 --> 00:16:22.890
(laughter)

00:16:22.891 --> 00:16:24.769
We could take all three.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.388
(sword unsheaths)

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:27.563
ASHLEY: I'll volunteer.

00:16:28.618 --> 00:16:30.027
MARISHA: Might not be a bad idea.

00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:31.217
TRAVIS: You take one, I'll take the other?

00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:32.051
ASHLEY: All right.

00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:32.884
TRAVIS: Yeah.
(sword swings)

00:16:32.884 --> 00:16:33.758
LIAM: Once we have time to rest,

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.767
I can put them in the amber, if we prefer.

00:16:36.768 --> 00:16:37.968
LAURA: We're going to rest?

00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:41.867
They could get all the way to the city.

00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:44.567
They could bring it back while we're sleeping.

00:16:44.568 --> 00:16:46.167
TRAVIS: Don't we need to know where they're going

00:16:46.168 --> 00:16:49.154
in the city that you flew over?

00:16:49.155 --> 00:16:49.988
TALIESIN: We do.

00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:51.867
MARISHA: I do think it's smart for you all to get a rest

00:16:51.868 --> 00:16:52.937
at some point in time.

00:16:52.938 --> 00:16:54.317
LAURA: Well, yeah, I can do nothing.

00:16:54.318 --> 00:16:58.537
TALIESIN: If we find them, what can we do, other than yell?

00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:00.817
LAURA: I mean, they're pretty hurt, too.

00:17:00.818 --> 00:17:02.837
Maybe we all just beat each other silly

00:17:02.838 --> 00:17:04.067
while we're bleeding to death.

00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:05.337
TALIESIN: I think their hurt and our hurt

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:07.138
are a world of difference right now.

00:17:08.188 --> 00:17:09.154
LIAM: You got a better look at them.

00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:10.254
They are both hurt?

00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:14.557
TRAVIS: It looked like Cree had been

00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:18.033
more banged up than Lucien and

00:17:19.608 --> 00:17:21.542
got them both out at the same time.

00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:26.877
But again, if they're on the other side of that rubble,

00:17:26.878 --> 00:17:28.707
and if they're going into that city and we don't know

00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:32.097
which house, or which wall, or the secret area,

00:17:32.098 --> 00:17:33.297
we're going to be lost,

00:17:33.298 --> 00:17:34.507
unless we have a way of tracking them

00:17:34.508 --> 00:17:35.608
that I'm not aware of?

00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:37.464
MARISHA: That's an excellent point.

00:17:37.464 --> 00:17:38.297
Do we have any way?

00:17:38.298 --> 00:17:40.422
LAURA: If we sleep, I'll be able to track them.

00:17:40.423 --> 00:17:41.720
TALIESIN: With sleep, I can track them, too.

00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:42.708
MARISHA: What is your plan?

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:44.369
Because we can't get through the city now.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.777
TALIESIN: So if we get back in there,

00:17:46.778 --> 00:17:51.727
I found this amphitheater,

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:56.279
theater of some kind,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.146
filled with corpses.

00:18:02.288 --> 00:18:06.270
They were watching this

00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:08.336
person who was on stage,

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:13.337
who, I don't know, had an air of power.

00:18:13.508 --> 00:18:16.035
They were frozen in those bubbles,

00:18:16.036 --> 00:18:18.261
the way that some people are.

00:18:20.278 --> 00:18:21.507
I think this person

00:18:21.508 --> 00:18:23.571
might've been fighting whatever happened.

00:18:25.278 --> 00:18:28.917
Maybe if we wake them up,

00:18:28.918 --> 00:18:33.918
we might have an ally in finding a way to stop this.

00:18:34.058 --> 00:18:35.147
It might be crazy.

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:39.887
I was going to maybe talk to somebody in the crowd

00:18:39.888 --> 00:18:41.877
to see if they could tell us who this person is.

00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:43.500
It might be someone who can help.

00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:45.816
LAURA: Oh, yeah. That's smart.
MARISHA: We tried to dispel it

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:47.180
before, though, didn't we?

00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:49.207
TALIESIN: We have help now.

00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:50.323
LAURA: That's true. Essek might have

00:18:50.324 --> 00:18:52.047
a better idea of what to do.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:55.857
I'm pulling rocks, looking for loose rocks that--

00:18:55.858 --> 00:18:57.452
MATT: All right, so as you guys head back into the tunnel,

00:18:57.453 --> 00:19:01.393
Essek's like, "Well, obviously I was extremely capable

00:19:01.394 --> 00:19:04.462
"of dispelling that thing that was on your chest before."

00:19:04.463 --> 00:19:05.817
LAURA: I did that, Essek.

00:19:05.818 --> 00:19:06.688
MATT: "I realize that.

00:19:06.689 --> 00:19:08.193
"That's the point. I was being sarcastic."

00:19:08.194 --> 00:19:11.607
LAURA: Oh, okay, I just wanted to remind you.

00:19:11.608 --> 00:19:13.557
MATT: "I appreciate that.

00:19:13.558 --> 00:19:15.527
"But nevertheless," and you see, as he starts

00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:17.167
putting his hands out in front like this,

00:19:17.168 --> 00:19:20.007
like he's soft throwing objects forward.

00:19:20.008 --> 00:19:23.962
You watch as rocks start (rumble) coming out

00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:25.257
as he's just plucking them

00:19:25.258 --> 00:19:27.897
as he pulls the gravity from them,

00:19:27.898 --> 00:19:29.347
aiding you as you guys go along, he's--

00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:30.961
LIAM: How thick does this look?

00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:33.774
MATT: You can make a perception or investigation check.

00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:35.234
LIAM: Yeah, I'll investigate it.

00:19:35.235 --> 00:19:37.117
SAM: I'm going to try to dig through

00:19:37.118 --> 00:19:40.277
and retrieve my unspent Fluffernutter.

00:19:40.278 --> 00:19:42.285
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an investigation.

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:45.137
LAURA: I'm pulling from the top so that we could potentially

00:19:45.138 --> 00:19:48.113
just move the top layer of rocks and crawl through.

00:19:48.114 --> 00:19:48.947
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: So we're not trying

00:19:48.947 --> 00:19:49.780
to clear the whole fucking tunnel.

00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:51.027
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Hurt Locker.

00:19:51.028 --> 00:19:52.854
MATT: Glancing through,

00:19:52.855 --> 00:19:54.927
this hallway that you guys traveled through

00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:57.204
is pretty well-reinforced on the sides,

00:19:57.205 --> 00:19:59.467
and elements of it did hold pretty well.

00:19:59.468 --> 00:20:02.337
This quake definitely found the weak parts,

00:20:02.338 --> 00:20:03.687
and the elements that did collapse,

00:20:03.688 --> 00:20:05.227
you can see there are probably two batches

00:20:05.228 --> 00:20:08.167
or two sections of about 10 feet,

00:20:08.168 --> 00:20:12.187
that are more or less fallen in, of loose rock,

00:20:12.188 --> 00:20:17.157
some larger than others, but it's not an extensive cave in.

00:20:17.158 --> 00:20:19.957
It's hard to say how long it'll take,

00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:22.077
but if it's all hands on deck, it may be quicker.

00:20:22.078 --> 00:20:26.957
LAURA: If we're pulling rocks and
they've fallen from way above,

00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:29.577
it's a potential that the entire ground

00:20:29.578 --> 00:20:31.471
could collapse on us and kill us all, right?

00:20:31.472 --> 00:20:32.871
MATT: It's possible.
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

00:20:32.872 --> 00:20:33.907
Cool, cool, cool.

00:20:33.908 --> 00:20:35.037
ASHLEY: I'll help as well.

00:20:35.038 --> 00:20:36.933
TALIESIN: Who's hurt, by the way?
MARISHA: Yeah, same.

00:20:36.934 --> 00:20:38.307
TRAVIS: I'll keep going.

00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:39.317
LAURA: I mean, I'm down.

00:20:39.318 --> 00:20:40.151
I'm down.

00:20:40.152 --> 00:20:41.865
LIAM: A little bit.
MATT: All right.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:42.699
Everyone's helping.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.827
I'd like everyone to make an athletics check for me

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.630
as a group.

00:20:46.631 --> 00:20:47.966
LAURA: Guidance.

00:20:49.893 --> 00:20:51.367
MARISHA: Okay.

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:52.201
TRAVIS: 11.

00:20:54.118 --> 00:20:54.951
MATT: All righty.
LIAM: 15.

00:20:54.952 --> 00:20:56.616
LAURA: 18.
MATT: 15. 18.

00:20:56.617 --> 00:20:58.207
SAM: 12.
MATT: 12.

00:20:58.208 --> 00:20:59.667
ASHLEY: 14.
MATT: 14.

00:20:59.668 --> 00:21:01.147
TALIESIN: Seven.
MATT: Seven.

00:21:01.148 --> 00:21:03.977
MARISHA: 25.
MATT: 25.

00:21:03.978 --> 00:21:05.078
LIAM: Except for the legs.

00:21:08.238 --> 00:21:11.047
MATT: It takes a little longer than you had maybe hoped,

00:21:11.048 --> 00:21:14.847
but you do manage, within the next 15, 20 or so minutes,

00:21:14.848 --> 00:21:18.047
to pull enough rocks free of that first section

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:20.187
that there's enough space to crawl through

00:21:20.188 --> 00:21:22.827
and not feel like you're going to shift loose

00:21:22.828 --> 00:21:25.996
any additional load-bearing portions of the rock above you.

00:21:25.997 --> 00:21:27.727
And you can see there's a small pocket above,

00:21:27.728 --> 00:21:29.387
where one of these heavy pieces of shale

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.357
shifted a bit and was leaning inward,

00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:35.257
but, thankfully, you could probably make it through okay.

00:21:35.258 --> 00:21:39.099
As you crawl your way through that first batch,

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.227
Essek glides through and then reaches out

00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:43.917
and pulls out something, and clutches it

00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:45.098
near his face.

00:21:49.288 --> 00:21:50.303
"It's Dagen."

00:21:50.304 --> 00:21:51.620
(gasping)

00:21:51.621 --> 00:21:54.177
TALIESIN: (deep exhale)

00:21:54.178 --> 00:21:55.011
MATT: "Right.

00:21:58.298 --> 00:21:59.948
"Yes, head back and let them know.

00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:01.871
"Thank you.

00:22:03.348 --> 00:22:06.462
"There are some rangers lost, many injured,

00:22:06.463 --> 00:22:09.257
"but there are some survivors.

00:22:09.258 --> 00:22:12.069
"That was their warning call to let us know

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.987
"that the Tomb Takers were coming."

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:23.541
SAM: So they're okay?

00:22:24.448 --> 00:22:25.406
MATT: "Some.

00:22:27.668 --> 00:22:29.397
"Dagen seemed a little worse for wear,

00:22:29.398 --> 00:22:32.939
"but he was speaking at least."

00:22:35.303 --> 00:22:38.327
LIAM: Well, there's no choice but to go forward.

00:22:38.328 --> 00:22:41.246
SAM: Should we get the rest of them down here to help us?

00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:46.640
MARISHA: Might just be best for them to head back,

00:22:46.641 --> 00:22:47.961
relay the message.

00:22:50.678 --> 00:22:52.007
SAM: Okay.

00:22:52.008 --> 00:22:53.194
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:22:53.195 --> 00:22:54.028
MATT: All right.

00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:56.907
For the second passage, everyone please make

00:22:56.908 --> 00:22:57.987
one more athletics check.

00:22:57.988 --> 00:22:59.783
TRAVIS: Come on, man.

00:22:59.784 --> 00:23:01.837
Much better this time.

00:23:01.838 --> 00:23:02.671
LIAM: Three.

00:23:03.598 --> 00:23:04.720
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:06.486
24.

00:23:06.487 --> 00:23:08.117
LAURA: Nine.

00:23:08.118 --> 00:23:09.675
MATT: Three.
SAM: 15.

00:23:09.676 --> 00:23:10.509
ASHLEY: 19.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.207
TALIESIN: Natural one for five.

00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:13.041
MARISHA: 24.

00:23:15.366 --> 00:23:16.358
ASHLEY: (sighs)

00:23:16.358 --> 00:23:17.191
SAM: Not great.

00:23:18.768 --> 00:23:20.418
MATT: This one takes a little longer.

00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:24.387
Roughly 25 minutes, and a couple of precarious moments

00:23:24.388 --> 00:23:25.797
where you pull one rock free,

00:23:25.798 --> 00:23:27.057
and a few more slide back in,

00:23:27.058 --> 00:23:28.457
and everyone freezes for a second,

00:23:28.458 --> 00:23:31.695
afraid that the next collapse is going to happen.

00:23:31.696 --> 00:23:35.319
And then one by one, carefully find the looser bits,

00:23:37.128 --> 00:23:40.357
and then open before yourselves a passage

00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:43.261
where most of you can travel through comfortably,

00:23:44.168 --> 00:23:46.517
couple of you not as comfortably.

00:23:46.518 --> 00:23:50.927
But eventually you climb through the opposite end.

00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:54.411
Right about where that bend at the top of the incline was,

00:23:55.778 --> 00:23:58.697
you can see there is the bridge board that went across.

00:23:58.698 --> 00:23:59.987
It has fallen somewhat in,

00:23:59.988 --> 00:24:02.038
but it can be readjusted and placed back.

00:24:04.858 --> 00:24:06.354
No, that was the rope you guys had placed.

00:24:06.355 --> 00:24:07.188
TRAVIS and LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: That's right.

00:24:07.189 --> 00:24:08.958
But you had taken the rope.

00:24:09.962 --> 00:24:11.186
MARISHA: We left the rope.

00:24:11.187 --> 00:24:12.610
LAURA: We did leave the rope.
MATT: You did leave the rope?

00:24:12.611 --> 00:24:13.867
LIAM: Used the rope to lower down.

00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:15.407
MATT: Correct, so the rope would still be there,

00:24:15.408 --> 00:24:17.627
though a large portion of it is currently--

00:24:17.628 --> 00:24:19.067
LIAM: Buried.
MATT: -- buried.

00:24:19.068 --> 00:24:20.717
But it is still a taut rope

00:24:20.718 --> 00:24:23.557
across the way, so.

00:24:23.558 --> 00:24:25.717
MARISHA: I'll Naruto run across.

00:24:25.718 --> 00:24:27.885
MATT: Easy enough for you, Miss Beauregard.

00:24:30.008 --> 00:24:31.767
With your help and with the rope taut,

00:24:31.768 --> 00:24:33.471
we'll say, for the ease of time,

00:24:34.488 --> 00:24:36.362
carefully, you make your way across.

00:24:36.363 --> 00:24:39.147
SAM: I will Beau-ruto run across.

00:24:39.148 --> 00:24:41.545
MARISHA: Mm, that's better.
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:42.379
MATT: You feel a little shown up

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.808
by the next generation, I'm sorry.

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:47.365
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. (laughs)
(laughter)

00:24:47.366 --> 00:24:48.897
LIAM: They're very similar, though.

00:24:48.898 --> 00:24:49.731
Very, very similar.

00:24:49.732 --> 00:24:51.174
TRAVIS: I will Zetsu climb up.

00:24:51.175 --> 00:24:54.716
(laughter)

00:24:56.868 --> 00:24:59.787
MATT: Well, you eventually reach the end of the tunnel

00:24:59.788 --> 00:25:02.877
and it opens up once more into the ward

00:25:02.878 --> 00:25:04.827
where you've previously been,

00:25:04.828 --> 00:25:07.657
the same darkened, massive chamber before you

00:25:07.658 --> 00:25:10.947
with the various glowing pin lights of color

00:25:10.948 --> 00:25:13.820
in the shadowed distance. The neighborhood lies before you.

00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:14.698
What would you like to do?

00:25:14.699 --> 00:25:15.787
LAURA: Is there dust on the ground?

00:25:15.788 --> 00:25:17.292
Can we see footprints that they've left?

00:25:17.293 --> 00:25:18.577
Anything like that?

00:25:18.578 --> 00:25:20.157
MATT: You can make an investigation check, if you'd like.

00:25:20.158 --> 00:25:21.337
TRAVIS: Do we check for traps or anything?

00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:22.298
No booby traps?

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:23.467
SAM: Oh, because they were here.

00:25:23.468 --> 00:25:24.741
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
TRAVIS: I think they were probably moving.

00:25:24.742 --> 00:25:26.177
LIAM: An hour ago they were here.

00:25:26.178 --> 00:25:27.297
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: An hour ago.

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:29.377
SAM: Have we walked through the threshold

00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:32.095
into the vast chamber of the city, or?

00:25:32.096 --> 00:25:33.447
MATT: You are at the threshold currently.

00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:35.707
SAM: I'll just scan around the threshold,

00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:39.109
see if there's anything up, or on the sides. Traps.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.384
TRAVIS: Giving us a taste of our own medicine.
MATT: Looking for traps?

00:25:40.385 --> 00:25:41.644
Perception or investigation, your call.

00:25:41.645 --> 00:25:43.207
LAURA: 24.
SAM: 23.

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.623
MATT: All right.

00:25:44.624 --> 00:25:45.977
You do not see any traps.

00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:49.107
You do see signs of travel,

00:25:49.108 --> 00:25:51.277
not because there are any footprints necessarily

00:25:51.278 --> 00:25:52.357
that kept your attention,

00:25:52.358 --> 00:25:56.223
but because there are some fresh dots of blood.

00:25:56.224 --> 00:25:57.057
MARISHA: Blood?

00:25:57.058 --> 00:25:59.935
Oh.

00:25:59.936 --> 00:26:01.317
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:26:01.318 --> 00:26:02.387
TRAVIS: They bleed.

00:26:02.388 --> 00:26:04.844
SAM: Well, can we follow these dots?

00:26:04.845 --> 00:26:07.307
MARISHA: Up until she heals herself, I guess.

00:26:07.308 --> 00:26:09.497
But yeah.
SAM: Sure, let's do it.

00:26:09.498 --> 00:26:11.997
MATT: All right. Who wants to lead the tracking?

00:26:11.998 --> 00:26:13.694
This would be survival-based.

00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:15.894
LAURA: Hold on.
TRAVIS: Not it.

00:26:15.895 --> 00:26:17.937
LAURA: My survival's pretty decent.

00:26:17.938 --> 00:26:20.058
MARISHA: Mine's okay. Plus four.

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:22.257
LIAM: Mine is too, and I will,

00:26:22.258 --> 00:26:23.467
if you're all good with it,

00:26:23.468 --> 00:26:25.307
I will cast Detect Magic as well

00:26:25.308 --> 00:26:26.591
and try to search.

00:26:27.488 --> 00:26:28.827
MATT: Certainly.

00:26:28.828 --> 00:26:30.651
Okay, searching for?

00:26:32.018 --> 00:26:33.487
LIAM: Their direction to follow along

00:26:33.488 --> 00:26:36.284
as far as possible, while also, for at least

00:26:36.285 --> 00:26:39.685
the first 10 minutes, seeing if any kind of glyphs or wards,

00:26:40.698 --> 00:26:43.037
taste of our own medicine, like you said, is waiting for us.

00:26:43.038 --> 00:26:43.871
MATT: You've got it.

00:26:43.872 --> 00:26:45.687
LAURA: Probably still be pretty quiet

00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:47.137
as we move through here.

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.245
MATT: Okay.

00:26:48.246 --> 00:26:50.246
As you expand your consciousness

00:26:51.228 --> 00:26:55.247
to reach for anything arcane around you, what'd you roll?

00:26:55.248 --> 00:26:57.107
LIAM: 11.
MATT: 11, okay.

00:26:57.108 --> 00:26:58.408
You feel pretty confident.

00:26:59.628 --> 00:27:01.487
Where are you guys heading within the ward?

00:27:01.488 --> 00:27:03.477
LAURA: We're following the blood.

00:27:03.478 --> 00:27:04.311
MATT: Okay.

00:27:06.738 --> 00:27:10.999
You continue along, and you rolled what for survival?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.177
LAURA: I didn't roll for survival.

00:27:13.178 --> 00:27:15.067
MATT: Oh, then you should roll for survival now,

00:27:15.068 --> 00:27:16.507
or whoever's helming that, I should say.

00:27:16.508 --> 00:27:18.424
SAM: The blood check, unless--

00:27:18.425 --> 00:27:19.748
Wait, Caleb, were you doing it?

00:27:19.749 --> 00:27:20.582
LIAM: I thought I was.

00:27:20.583 --> 00:27:22.777
I thought that's what the 11 was.
LAURA: 23, 24.

00:27:22.778 --> 00:27:24.317
No, way higher than that.

00:27:24.318 --> 00:27:25.717
MATT: Okay, I will say.

00:27:25.718 --> 00:27:27.500
Were you both rolling, or were you--?

00:27:28.375 --> 00:27:30.118
LAURA: I thought you were rolling
for Detect Magic. I didn't realize--

00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:31.457
LIAM: There is no rolling for Detect Magic.

00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:32.338
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: It just does it.

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:33.417
MATT: Right, okay.

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:34.837
And you rolled one die?

00:27:34.838 --> 00:27:37.776
LAURA: I rolled a 19, plus four, plus five.

00:27:37.777 --> 00:27:38.610
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: 28.

00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:39.884
LIAM: I like that number.

00:27:39.885 --> 00:27:40.897
MATT: Pretty good.

00:27:40.898 --> 00:27:43.829
So between the two of you, keeping an eye out

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.467
and carefully watching,

00:27:45.468 --> 00:27:48.595
the blood trail is not extensive,

00:27:48.596 --> 00:27:51.161
but it is fairly consistent for a bit.

00:27:52.568 --> 00:27:55.977
Meaning about every 30 or so feet

00:27:55.978 --> 00:27:59.841
you can find a sign of some sort of additional blot,

00:28:01.008 --> 00:28:03.937
scattered bit, fresh enough to the point

00:28:03.938 --> 00:28:04.988
where it's still wet.

00:28:06.728 --> 00:28:09.117
You begin to make your way steadily through the ward,

00:28:09.118 --> 00:28:11.757
and you can see it begins to dive off the main road

00:28:11.758 --> 00:28:14.547
and off a bit, continuing on for another

00:28:14.548 --> 00:28:17.027
10, 15 or so minutes.

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:18.247
And you begin to find yourselves

00:28:18.248 --> 00:28:20.967
deep, deep in the Praesidis Ward.

00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:21.918
Glancing around,

00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:26.725
the air still has that

00:28:26.726 --> 00:28:28.787
tense silence to it.

00:28:28.788 --> 00:28:33.047
That stillness where your ears,

00:28:33.048 --> 00:28:36.337
aside from the sound of your very careful footsteps,

00:28:36.338 --> 00:28:37.697
occasionally you stop and listen,

00:28:37.698 --> 00:28:40.377
it's almost oppressive how quiet it is.

00:28:40.378 --> 00:28:42.053
Pressing in on the eardrums.

00:28:43.745 --> 00:28:47.912
And you continue.
Are you going carefully?

00:28:47.913 --> 00:28:50.177
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: Caduceus, when you took

00:28:50.178 --> 00:28:54.207
your little trip around, was there a passage

00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:57.347
in the direction generally that we are headed in?

00:28:57.348 --> 00:28:59.197
TALIESIN: I don't think I saw any passage.

00:28:59.198 --> 00:29:01.267
MATT: You didn't go far enough.

00:29:01.268 --> 00:29:04.117
TALIESIN: Are we heading in the direction of the colosseum?

00:29:04.118 --> 00:29:05.475
MATT: Loosely.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:29:05.476 --> 00:29:08.434
MATT: Yeah, it's a little bit of a side path,

00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:09.725
but it's kind of in the direction

00:29:09.726 --> 00:29:11.109
you're going currently, yeah.

00:29:11.968 --> 00:29:13.027
TALIESIN: Never got far enough.

00:29:13.028 --> 00:29:14.629
LIAM: Okay.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.044
TALIESIN: This place is big.
LAURA: We should move stealthily.

00:29:16.045 --> 00:29:16.944
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: All right,

00:29:16.944 --> 00:29:17.777
so this will be slower travel,

00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:19.455
but I would like everyone to make a stealth check, please.

00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:20.987
LAURA: I'm going to give you Blessing of the Trickster.

00:29:20.988 --> 00:29:22.311
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

00:29:22.312 --> 00:29:23.417
LAURA: That gives you advantage.

00:29:24.258 --> 00:29:26.780
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)
LIAM: Come on, Colville die.

00:29:26.781 --> 00:29:28.825
TALIESIN: Fuck me.
TRAVIS: That's a good thing.

00:29:31.638 --> 00:29:32.887
First one was a three.

00:29:32.888 --> 00:29:34.055
Second one's a natural 20.

00:29:34.056 --> 00:29:35.249
LAURA: Yeah!

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.067
MATT: Nice, so a total of?

00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:37.901
TRAVIS: 20.

00:29:37.902 --> 00:29:40.217
(laughter)

00:29:40.218 --> 00:29:41.150
MATT: Jester?
LAURA: 18.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:41.992
MATT: 18.

00:29:41.993 --> 00:29:43.077
LIAM: 12.

00:29:43.078 --> 00:29:43.911
SAM: 34.

00:29:44.969 --> 00:29:45.961
ASHLEY: Nine.

00:29:45.962 --> 00:29:47.907
MARISHA: Nein!
TALIESIN: Four.

00:29:47.908 --> 00:29:49.353
MARISHA: 21.

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:52.259
LIAM: I get second-hand adrenaline
from those rogue rolls, man.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.097
MATT: That 20 may have saved you all.

00:29:54.098 --> 00:29:57.437
MARISHA: Yeah, no shit.
TRAVIS: Blessing of the Trickster.

00:29:57.438 --> 00:30:00.257
MATT: Careful as you go, occasionally

00:30:00.258 --> 00:30:01.677
a few of you begin to stumble

00:30:01.678 --> 00:30:03.354
or step into some loose rubble,

00:30:03.355 --> 00:30:04.817
and as it's about to crack,

00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:06.667
a hand reaches out and grabs you,

00:30:06.668 --> 00:30:08.817
helping you steady, preventing you from falling

00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:10.457
and causing a ruckus.

00:30:10.458 --> 00:30:11.690
You continue onward,

00:30:11.691 --> 00:30:15.991
following the intense, dark-cutting eyes

00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:19.947
of Jester, who follows the blood trail.

00:30:19.948 --> 00:30:22.031
(laughter)

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.727
MATT: Continuing on--
ASHLEY: Good investigation face.

00:30:25.728 --> 00:30:27.110
Look at her.

00:30:27.111 --> 00:30:28.151
She's so focused.
TRAVIS: Love that your glasses

00:30:28.152 --> 00:30:29.426
fogged up right when you did that.
LAURA: I know, I can't--

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:31.437
I just want to drink the tea and I can't.

00:30:31.438 --> 00:30:33.807
LIAM: How long has it been, roughly?

00:30:33.808 --> 00:30:34.997
MATT: Since the battle?
LIAM: Since we start--

00:30:34.998 --> 00:30:36.277
No, no, no, no.

00:30:36.278 --> 00:30:38.687
Since we started tracking the blood.

00:30:38.688 --> 00:30:39.984
MATT: Since you started tracking it?

00:30:39.985 --> 00:30:43.697
It's been about, I'd say, at the pace you're going,

00:30:43.698 --> 00:30:44.787
15 or so minutes.

00:30:44.788 --> 00:30:46.677
LIAM: I'm going to throw up Detect Magic again.

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:47.641
MATT: Okay.

00:30:47.642 --> 00:30:49.047
TRAVIS: Total time since we separated

00:30:49.048 --> 00:30:51.311
is an hour and a half?

00:30:51.312 --> 00:30:52.487
MATT: Approximately, yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:30:52.488 --> 00:30:54.597
MATT: With the time it took you to take out the rubble.

00:30:54.598 --> 00:30:56.197
LIAM: First rubble was 15-ish minutes.

00:30:56.198 --> 00:30:58.110
Second was 25-ish.
MATT: Correct.

00:30:58.111 --> 00:30:59.444
TRAVIS: 40, okay.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.487
MARISHA: Are the blood splatters still a consistent size

00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:06.111
or are they diminishing?

00:31:06.112 --> 00:31:08.777
MATT: At this moment, they seem consistent

00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:12.197
and it's enough where you could tell

00:31:12.198 --> 00:31:13.937
there was a brisk pace being taken.

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:14.771
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:31:15.938 --> 00:31:18.411
TRAVIS: It's also hard to know if it's from a wound

00:31:18.412 --> 00:31:20.807
or are they using the blood to heal themselves?

00:31:20.808 --> 00:31:22.987
MATT: It's hard to tell with these two.

00:31:22.988 --> 00:31:24.057
TRAVIS: Fuck.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:31:24.058 --> 00:31:26.197
LIAM: It could even be--
MARISHA: A honeypot.

00:31:26.198 --> 00:31:27.360
LIAM: It could even be-- yeah.

00:31:27.361 --> 00:31:28.226
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:31:28.227 --> 00:31:30.277
MARISHA: It's their leading us off course.

00:31:30.278 --> 00:31:33.517
I guess I'll track that, too.

00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:35.217
While Jester's following the blood trail,

00:31:35.218 --> 00:31:38.577
can I just track footsteps

00:31:38.578 --> 00:31:42.357
and see footprints, if there's any type of

00:31:42.358 --> 00:31:44.417
looking like they've covered their tracks.

00:31:44.418 --> 00:31:48.467
Just keep an eye out for any funny business.

00:31:48.468 --> 00:31:50.187
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

00:31:50.188 --> 00:31:51.629
MARISHA: Not investigation?

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.737
MATT: In this instance, this is a quick glance as you go.

00:31:54.738 --> 00:31:56.235
This isn't a stop and carefully

00:31:56.236 --> 00:31:57.801
spend five minutes in the dust.

00:31:57.802 --> 00:32:00.242
You guys are moving forward, unless you'd like to stop.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.389
MARISHA: I should just feed into perception.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.223
18.

00:32:05.224 --> 00:32:06.611
LIAM: That's pretty good.
MATT: 18's pretty good.

00:32:06.612 --> 00:32:07.495
MARISHA: It's pretty good.

00:32:07.496 --> 00:32:08.827
MATT: Okay.

00:32:08.828 --> 00:32:11.201
The footprints that you can now begin to make out,

00:32:11.202 --> 00:32:14.017
as opposed to the previous entrance to this ward,

00:32:14.018 --> 00:32:16.097
there's now a lot more rock, rubble, dust,

00:32:16.098 --> 00:32:19.037
and just general debris around where you can make out

00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:21.767
where the footsteps near this trail are,

00:32:21.768 --> 00:32:26.137
and it does appear to be a fairly elongated gait.

00:32:26.138 --> 00:32:28.237
There is a haste in travel.

00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:31.507
You do not think that they've stopped or have taken care

00:32:31.508 --> 00:32:34.007
in guarding their path, from what you can tell.

00:32:34.008 --> 00:32:36.797
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

00:32:36.798 --> 00:32:38.057
MATT: We're a few minutes away from--

00:32:38.058 --> 00:32:40.687
you can just begin to see at this distance

00:32:40.688 --> 00:32:44.797
at a bit of the glow, the massive shape of the amphitheater

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:48.377
that you had previously arrived at

00:32:48.378 --> 00:32:49.331
within this ward.

00:32:50.851 --> 00:32:55.844
TALIESIN: Is it worth stopping to
see if we can get some help?

00:32:55.845 --> 00:32:58.737
LAURA: I mean, how far off the path is it?

00:32:58.738 --> 00:33:00.587
MATT: It'll take you maybe five minutes to run there.

00:33:00.588 --> 00:33:02.330
LAURA: (uncertain noise) You're great.

00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:04.777
We could get to the amphitheater

00:33:04.778 --> 00:33:06.197
and get back to this exact spot,

00:33:06.198 --> 00:33:07.427
because you'll be able to find the way.

00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:09.987
LIAM: Absolutely, but I wonder, we're talking about

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:12.987
taking a rest, and we're following a fresh trail,

00:33:12.988 --> 00:33:15.038
we think, if they're not fucking with us.

00:33:18.358 --> 00:33:22.027
Do we stop and detour to try to enlist the dead,

00:33:22.028 --> 00:33:25.377
or do we try to follow this trail as long as it is fresh?

00:33:25.378 --> 00:33:29.557
Even if we know we are going to try to rest relatively soon,

00:33:29.558 --> 00:33:30.391
I don't know.

00:33:30.391 --> 00:33:31.224
I'm just--
MARISHA: Even if we could just

00:33:31.225 --> 00:33:33.437
get a general direction to where,

00:33:33.438 --> 00:33:36.697
if we get on the path and we know that that is the direction

00:33:36.698 --> 00:33:38.147
they're for sure headed.

00:33:38.148 --> 00:33:40.227
LIAM: That's what I'm thinking is if we just go a little,

00:33:40.228 --> 00:33:41.707
not abandon the amphitheater,

00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:43.807
but if we follow a little bit further,

00:33:43.808 --> 00:33:47.715
and maybe can ascertain where, from this massive chamber,

00:33:47.716 --> 00:33:48.588
wherein they're going.

00:33:48.588 --> 00:33:49.421
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:33:49.422 --> 00:33:52.807
LIAM: And then we know we're stopping anyway, so.

00:33:52.808 --> 00:33:54.217
LIAM: If one of the other Tomb Takers

00:33:54.218 --> 00:33:57.807
happens to know where they're going, we can always ask.

00:33:57.808 --> 00:33:59.050
LIAM: Right.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:00.008
MARISHA: That's true.

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:03.197
TRAVIS: Time totals on needing to talk

00:34:03.198 --> 00:34:05.991
to a dead head is instantaneous?

00:34:07.198 --> 00:34:08.231
TALIESIN: Pretty much.

00:34:09.088 --> 00:34:09.921
Yeah.

00:34:09.922 --> 00:34:11.407
TRAVIS: And Dispel, and anything else we would try

00:34:11.408 --> 00:34:15.897
on the blue globule is instantaneous? Okay.

00:34:15.898 --> 00:34:17.917
TALIESIN: We'd want to talk to somebody
in the crowd to make sure

00:34:17.918 --> 00:34:20.312
that this wasn't a problem.

00:34:20.313 --> 00:34:21.617
LAURA: A bad guy?
TRAVIS: Right.

00:34:21.618 --> 00:34:22.451
TALIESIN: Bad guy.

00:34:23.908 --> 00:34:25.077
TRAVIS: Sabotage from the inside.

00:34:25.078 --> 00:34:27.387
Also, don't want to let out, like,
a super powerful wizard

00:34:27.388 --> 00:34:30.987
from a thousand years ago,
but I'm sure that's not the case.

00:34:30.988 --> 00:34:33.267
TALIESIN: Maybe, you'll see.

00:34:33.268 --> 00:34:35.081
LAURA: They're probably not all like Halas.

00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:37.187
TRAVIS: Probably.

00:34:37.188 --> 00:34:39.187
(spookily) Mostly.

00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:40.021
TALIESIN: Mostly.

00:34:40.022 --> 00:34:42.627
SAM: So we all keep pursuing?

00:34:42.628 --> 00:34:43.735
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yes, for now.

00:34:43.736 --> 00:34:45.736
LIAM: I think we should.
TRAVIS: Yeah, Caleb has it right.

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:47.851
LAURA: Yeah.

00:34:49.198 --> 00:34:50.068
SAM: All right.

00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:51.181
Follow the blood.

00:34:52.258 --> 00:34:53.862
LAURA: Keep following the blood.

00:34:53.863 --> 00:34:58.647
LIAM: And I'll have Caduceus point
the way to the amphitheater,

00:34:58.648 --> 00:35:00.867
so that I know, using Keen Mind, where we are now,

00:35:00.868 --> 00:35:04.017
where it was, and I can probably do the math later.

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:05.142
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: You've got a triangle.

00:35:05.143 --> 00:35:06.624
TALIESIN: It's not hard to spot.
LAURA: We can see the dome, too.

00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:08.047
MATT: It's fairly large compared to

00:35:08.048 --> 00:35:10.264
a lot of the surrounding buildings.

00:35:10.265 --> 00:35:13.277
It's just at certain angles, because it's so dark in here,

00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:15.607
there is no skyline of the buildings.

00:35:15.608 --> 00:35:18.753
So only at certain points, do some of the lights pass by

00:35:18.754 --> 00:35:21.131
or around the shape to where you can make it out,

00:35:21.988 --> 00:35:24.577
but beyond those moments, it just blends in

00:35:24.578 --> 00:35:25.897
with the rest of the darkness of the cavern.

00:35:25.898 --> 00:35:28.214
The city just kind of appears in shapes

00:35:28.215 --> 00:35:29.601
as you move and it vanishes.

00:35:32.108 --> 00:35:35.191
So, continuing onward,

00:35:36.268 --> 00:35:38.318
for about how long do you want to follow?

00:35:40.898 --> 00:35:42.388
LAURA: I don't--

00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:44.188
SAM: Do we reach-- I mean, forever.

00:35:44.189 --> 00:35:45.022
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: As long as we get

00:35:45.023 --> 00:35:46.160
to the end of the city.

00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:47.856
TRAVIS: Like a thousand feet.
LAURA: Yeah. I think we

00:35:47.857 --> 00:35:49.467
want to know where we're going pretty much,

00:35:49.468 --> 00:35:51.647
so we'll follow it as long as we can.

00:35:51.648 --> 00:35:53.355
LIAM: Right.
MATT: Okay.

00:35:53.356 --> 00:35:56.207
LIAM: And if we stumble upon them, we still have numbers.

00:35:56.208 --> 00:35:57.596
TRAVIS: We do.

00:35:57.597 --> 00:35:59.573
LIAM: I'm not completely tapped.

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:02.367
Does anybody have any reserves left?

00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:03.417
TRAVIS: Yes.
LIAM: You, you?

00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:05.217
LAURA: Yeah, Caduceus has a lot of spells left, I think.

00:36:05.218 --> 00:36:08.697
TALIESIN: Yeah, but it's all, I mean, I didn't come in here

00:36:08.698 --> 00:36:09.608
looking for a fight.

00:36:09.609 --> 00:36:11.627
If we get into one--
LIAM: Understood.

00:36:11.628 --> 00:36:13.294
TALIESIN: -- I can just keep some of you--

00:36:13.295 --> 00:36:14.727
LIAM: It's just if we step on a bear trap,

00:36:14.728 --> 00:36:16.351
I mean, you know?
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:36:16.352 --> 00:36:17.697
TALIESIN: As long as it's not me.

00:36:17.698 --> 00:36:19.437
LAURA: I've got some low levels.

00:36:19.438 --> 00:36:20.447
LIAM: Okay.

00:36:20.448 --> 00:36:21.627
All right, let's push forward

00:36:21.628 --> 00:36:23.497
and see if we can figure out if

00:36:23.498 --> 00:36:25.987
they're trying to exit out the side of this space

00:36:25.988 --> 00:36:27.171
or down a hole.

00:36:28.631 --> 00:36:29.464
MATT: Okay.

00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:35.508
I would like you to make another survival check.

00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:41.585
LIAM: Can I assist her, as I am detecting magic?

00:36:41.586 --> 00:36:43.820
MATT: If you'd like.
LIAM: Just roll an advantage, girl.

00:36:48.862 --> 00:36:50.067
LAURA: 20.
MATT: 20.

00:36:50.068 --> 00:36:55.068
Okay, the path is a little more challenging

00:36:55.238 --> 00:36:56.797
to continue following.

00:36:56.798 --> 00:37:00.916
The blood trail begins to thin,

00:37:02.528 --> 00:37:06.497
and about 10 more minutes forward,

00:37:06.498 --> 00:37:09.577
you notice the path is bending a little bit to the right.

00:37:09.578 --> 00:37:12.107
The darting between alleys, between structures,

00:37:12.108 --> 00:37:14.607
it's not a continuous forward motion,

00:37:14.608 --> 00:37:18.447
it's tending to curve in a somewhat right-hand direction,

00:37:18.448 --> 00:37:21.117
which, Caleb, you would know would be

00:37:21.118 --> 00:37:23.797
more of a southern direction from where you were facing

00:37:23.798 --> 00:37:26.867
as opposed to going the kind of eastern path

00:37:26.868 --> 00:37:29.187
that you all were originally heading.

00:37:29.188 --> 00:37:30.021
LIAM: Right.

00:37:30.022 --> 00:37:32.617
And I, because of the feat, know where north is always,

00:37:32.618 --> 00:37:34.561
so I'm a little GPS.
MATT: Exactly.

00:37:35.618 --> 00:37:38.627
But eventually that blood begins to fade,

00:37:38.628 --> 00:37:39.778
and it comes to a stop,

00:37:41.378 --> 00:37:45.187
right next to a different building

00:37:45.188 --> 00:37:47.227
to the left of where you're standing.

00:37:47.228 --> 00:37:49.567
It was once probably

00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:53.051
an incredible, multi-tiered, opulent temple-like structure,

00:37:54.638 --> 00:37:57.447
but it now stands at a very precarious angle.

00:37:57.448 --> 00:38:02.167
It looks like the majority of it is fallen in on one side

00:38:02.168 --> 00:38:05.867
and is leaning slightly to a left,

00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:08.297
in a Leaning Tower of Pisa kind of way.

00:38:08.298 --> 00:38:11.257
Though, structurally much more damaged.

00:38:11.258 --> 00:38:12.637
And it is sitting within

00:38:12.638 --> 00:38:15.127
a deeply fallen sinkhole.

00:38:15.128 --> 00:38:17.467
About 20 or so feet beneath,

00:38:17.468 --> 00:38:19.437
it has pushed into the ground

00:38:19.438 --> 00:38:21.577
and then fallen to that side.

00:38:21.578 --> 00:38:24.277
Surrounding it, you can see numerous deep cracks

00:38:24.278 --> 00:38:26.547
that spiral up around from the base

00:38:26.548 --> 00:38:28.737
of where it currently stands,

00:38:28.738 --> 00:38:32.447
and sundered grounds of earth and trees

00:38:32.448 --> 00:38:36.907
and bits of garden that have fallen the sinkhole,

00:38:36.908 --> 00:38:40.561
where all the greenery now lies gray and pale.

00:38:42.188 --> 00:38:44.207
But you do see an opening into the structure.

00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:45.421
LIAM: Is it petrified?

00:38:47.148 --> 00:38:48.631
MATT: Well,

00:38:51.131 --> 00:38:53.646
as I've learned, petrified does not mean

00:38:53.647 --> 00:38:55.741
what I thought it meant my entire life,

00:38:57.158 --> 00:39:00.281
as was clarified on Twitter for me.

00:39:01.768 --> 00:39:02.601
SAM: Twitter is the best.

00:39:02.601 --> 00:39:03.434
MATT: Exactly.

00:39:03.435 --> 00:39:05.188
You learn forcefully.
SAM: It's like science class.

00:39:05.189 --> 00:39:07.253
MATT: No, thank you.

00:39:07.254 --> 00:39:08.886
LIAM: "I like chocolate." "Vanilla."

00:39:08.887 --> 00:39:10.064
MATT: Yep. (laughs)

00:39:10.065 --> 00:39:11.802
MARISHA: A dictionary that tells you when you're wrong.

00:39:11.803 --> 00:39:16.097
MATT: The plant life does not appear to be alive,

00:39:16.098 --> 00:39:17.387
and has lost its color,

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.947
but you are not close enough to fully inspect--

00:39:19.948 --> 00:39:20.848
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: To get any sort of

00:39:20.849 --> 00:39:22.709
sense of what its current state is

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:27.597
beyond the pale coloration of the leaves, and the bark,

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:28.992
and other garden elements.
LIAM: And did you say

00:39:28.993 --> 00:39:32.637
that the blood, that the trail is leading to this?

00:39:32.638 --> 00:39:34.107
MATT: It's adjacent to it.

00:39:34.108 --> 00:39:35.917
LIAM: Adjacent.

00:39:35.918 --> 00:39:39.597
SAM: And the leaves are on the structure?

00:39:39.598 --> 00:39:42.137
MATT: They're in the sinkhole based around it,

00:39:42.138 --> 00:39:44.047
like it was sitting in this

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:47.355
slightly circular garden courtyard,

00:39:47.356 --> 00:39:49.327
and then it all fell in about 20 feet,

00:39:49.328 --> 00:39:51.704
and the temple (rumbling crash)

00:39:51.705 --> 00:39:53.388
fell to the side slightly.

00:39:54.297 --> 00:39:59.297
SAM: Should we go take a look at the petrified plants

00:39:59.775 --> 00:40:02.127
or what's inside that temple thing?

00:40:02.128 --> 00:40:03.947
LIAM: Only if we think they went in here.

00:40:03.948 --> 00:40:04.831
Can we take a closer

00:40:04.832 --> 00:40:07.164
look and see if turned off towards this?
SAM: Jester, did they?

00:40:07.165 --> 00:40:09.557
LAURA: I mean, this is where the trail ends.

00:40:09.558 --> 00:40:11.367
They could've wandered off that direction,

00:40:11.368 --> 00:40:12.647
they could've have gone in the building.

00:40:12.648 --> 00:40:16.085
LIAM: So it's just evaporating here, the trail?

00:40:16.086 --> 00:40:17.285
MATT: You know the direction it's going,

00:40:17.286 --> 00:40:18.977
but at least the blood, which is what you've been

00:40:18.978 --> 00:40:21.942
primarily following this entire time, has come to a halt.

00:40:21.943 --> 00:40:24.351
MARISHA: Are there footsteps heading into the temple?

00:40:24.352 --> 00:40:25.979
MATT: You want to go ahead and make a perception check?

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.817
MARISHA: I do.

00:40:26.818 --> 00:40:27.900
LAURA: I'm going to Guide you.
MATT: Or investigation.

00:40:27.901 --> 00:40:28.826
LIAM: I'm going to investigate.

00:40:28.827 --> 00:40:30.355
I'm going to search.
MARISHA: I can investigate this one?

00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:31.256
MATT: Are you taking a moment to--

00:40:31.257 --> 00:40:32.787
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take a moment.
MATT: -- to carefully look around, it you want to.

00:40:32.788 --> 00:40:34.037
LAURA: I'm going to just give you lots of pats

00:40:34.038 --> 00:40:36.089
and one of them is going to give you Guidance.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.657
MATT: This does take time, but yes.

00:40:37.658 --> 00:40:38.638
MARISHA: Okay.

00:40:38.638 --> 00:40:39.471
Investigation.

00:40:40.578 --> 00:40:42.217
Guidance has plus four?

00:40:42.218 --> 00:40:43.727
TALIESIN: d4.

00:40:43.728 --> 00:40:44.561
MARISHA: Okay.

00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:45.548
MATT: Perception is a quick glance,

00:40:45.549 --> 00:40:47.967
investigation is on the ground.

00:40:47.968 --> 00:40:48.838
MARISHA: 21.

00:40:48.838 --> 00:40:49.671
LIAM: I looked as well.

00:40:49.672 --> 00:40:51.927
MATT: Like Rick Moranis-ing from Honey I Shrunk the Kids.

00:40:51.928 --> 00:40:53.254
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Just pouring through the grass.

00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:55.177
TRAVIS: Like Hammock Rick.
LAURA: Like, yeah.

00:40:55.178 --> 00:40:56.011
I love that.

00:40:56.012 --> 00:40:57.807
MATT: Sorry, what were you saying?

00:40:57.808 --> 00:40:59.497
LIAM: Oh, I said that I looked as well

00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:01.217
and rolled a 24 for investigation.

00:41:01.218 --> 00:41:02.051
MATT: Okay, and?

00:41:02.052 --> 00:41:03.605
MARISHA: 21.
MATT: 21. Okay.

00:41:03.606 --> 00:41:04.738
TRAVIS: Honey I Shrunk the Kids.

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:06.329
LAURA: That movie's so good.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.757
TRAVIS: That magnify.

00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:10.231
MATT: You can see footprints.

00:41:11.718 --> 00:41:16.187
Because there isn't a lot of weather in here,

00:41:16.188 --> 00:41:19.497
it's a little hard to tell which have been long trekked,

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:21.169
versus what is fresh.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.197
The fresh blood trail was what was really

00:41:23.198 --> 00:41:25.717
guiding you as to what was new

00:41:25.718 --> 00:41:30.714
and what was uniquely recent.

00:41:30.715 --> 00:41:32.927
There are numerous footprints in the region.

00:41:32.928 --> 00:41:36.497
There are some that head around to where the structure is,

00:41:36.498 --> 00:41:37.997
some that continue on the path

00:41:37.998 --> 00:41:39.177
where you guys were currently walking,

00:41:39.178 --> 00:41:41.421
some that bend back this way.

00:41:42.468 --> 00:41:46.357
And you do also continue to find more and more

00:41:46.358 --> 00:41:48.667
mummified bodies that are now strewn out

00:41:48.668 --> 00:41:50.018
in the sides of the street.

00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:53.288
Probably a little more dense

00:41:53.289 --> 00:41:55.581
than some of the previous roads you were traveling.

00:41:58.858 --> 00:42:00.507
So you find footprints.

00:42:00.508 --> 00:42:01.341
LIAM: Yeah.

00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:04.057
TRAVIS: Someone goes in the building,

00:42:04.058 --> 00:42:06.071
someone lights up the hole?

00:42:08.278 --> 00:42:11.278
MARISHA: Yeah, because if they're
camping right inside or something.

00:42:12.608 --> 00:42:15.598
LIAM: Yeah, either they passed this

00:42:16.748 --> 00:42:18.627
or perhaps this thing is sunken in,

00:42:18.628 --> 00:42:20.307
it could be that there is a passage

00:42:20.308 --> 00:42:21.487
down under this place, yeah?

00:42:21.488 --> 00:42:22.604
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking as well.

00:42:22.605 --> 00:42:23.828
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Because it doesn't cost anything,

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:26.227
I'll use Divine Sense.

00:42:26.228 --> 00:42:28.243
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: 60 feet,

00:42:28.244 --> 00:42:29.819
celestial, fiend, undead.

00:42:30.987 --> 00:42:33.097
MATT: Okay, and you are encompassing

00:42:33.098 --> 00:42:34.127
just the space in the road?

00:42:34.128 --> 00:42:36.687
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go right up in between

00:42:36.688 --> 00:42:38.837
the sinkhole and the building,

00:42:38.838 --> 00:42:41.634
and just see if there's anything camping out.

00:42:45.348 --> 00:42:48.147
MATT: You get a very strong sense of something

00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:49.203
within the structure.

00:42:49.204 --> 00:42:50.369
LAURA: (gasps) Uh-oh.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:53.578
SAM: Something alive or just something?

00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:54.579
TRAVIS: Something.

00:42:55.528 --> 00:42:56.361
Can I tell?

00:42:56.362 --> 00:42:58.347
MATT: Does it specify that you can tell what the source is?

00:42:58.348 --> 00:42:59.517
TRAVIS: Can detect good and evil.

00:42:59.518 --> 00:43:00.478
"Until the end of next turn,

00:43:00.479 --> 00:43:02.497
"you can sense anything affected by the Hallow spell,

00:43:02.498 --> 00:43:06.067
"and the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead

00:43:06.068 --> 00:43:08.437
"within 60 feet that is not behind total coverage."

00:43:08.438 --> 00:43:11.927
MATT: I will say that it is not behind total cover.

00:43:11.928 --> 00:43:14.917
You can just faintly make out something in there.

00:43:14.918 --> 00:43:19.087
TRAVIS: Okay. There is something, I don't know what,

00:43:19.088 --> 00:43:20.970
inside the building.

00:43:20.971 --> 00:43:22.037
LAURA: Oh.

00:43:22.038 --> 00:43:24.107
TRAVIS: Of a celestial, fiend, or undead nature.

00:43:24.108 --> 00:43:26.347
LAURA: Are there cracks that you could maybe see through

00:43:26.348 --> 00:43:27.417
on the outside of the building?

00:43:27.418 --> 00:43:29.067
Like, we could get a little peeksies

00:43:29.068 --> 00:43:33.049
on the inside without peeking your head in the door?

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.787
MATT: Possibly.

00:43:34.788 --> 00:43:36.120
Do you want to do that?
LAURA: Sure.

00:43:36.121 --> 00:43:37.295
TALIESIN: Are we poking this badger?

00:43:37.296 --> 00:43:38.537
Okay, we're poking the badger.

00:43:38.538 --> 00:43:39.737
MARISHA: I think we just want to see what it is.

00:43:39.738 --> 00:43:41.267
MATT: So you climb down through the sinkhole

00:43:41.268 --> 00:43:42.258
to go up to the building

00:43:42.259 --> 00:43:44.058
to look in through one of the holes?

00:43:44.916 --> 00:43:46.847
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: <i>You're</i> doing this?

00:43:46.848 --> 00:43:48.613
LAURA: I already said it.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:43:48.614 --> 00:43:50.337
MATT: Okay. So you all watch as Jester begins to

00:43:50.338 --> 00:43:51.971
skip down into the sinkhole amongst the--

00:43:51.972 --> 00:43:54.604
LAURA: I'm not skipping, I'm being careful.

00:43:54.605 --> 00:43:55.617
TALIESIN: You want a heal or something?

00:43:55.618 --> 00:43:56.538
Okay, never mind.

00:43:56.539 --> 00:43:57.945
SAM: You want some help, or are you okay?

00:43:57.946 --> 00:43:59.187
LAURA: Sure.

00:43:59.188 --> 00:44:01.806
LIAM: I cast Detect Magic again and follow her down quietly.

00:44:01.807 --> 00:44:02.797
SAM: Oh good.

00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:03.756
Caleb's got it.

00:44:03.757 --> 00:44:05.192
(laughter)

00:44:05.193 --> 00:44:06.556
Everybody else stay.

00:44:08.158 --> 00:44:09.138
I'll go, too.

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:10.857
LAURA: I'm being careful.

00:44:10.858 --> 00:44:13.727
MATT: As you're stepping through, it's a softer descent.

00:44:13.728 --> 00:44:17.297
The ground itself is soft earth and dirt

00:44:17.298 --> 00:44:21.207
that has been churned and left to rest where it's settled.

00:44:21.208 --> 00:44:24.457
It's a unique departure from the harsh, dark,

00:44:24.458 --> 00:44:26.377
broken stone ground you've been walking on

00:44:26.378 --> 00:44:29.762
for close to an hour at this point, if not more.

00:44:30.628 --> 00:44:32.587
Soft ground gives way under your weight,

00:44:32.588 --> 00:44:34.147
and you eventually come to the edge of the structure,

00:44:34.148 --> 00:44:36.897
and you can see it is intricate in its detailing,

00:44:36.898 --> 00:44:41.898
these layers, it has this beautiful craftsmanship

00:44:42.068 --> 00:44:43.517
to the exterior, and the closer you get,

00:44:43.518 --> 00:44:45.077
the more intricate details you can see

00:44:45.078 --> 00:44:46.787
carved into the stonework.

00:44:46.788 --> 00:44:50.727
A bunch of decorative glyphs and writing,

00:44:50.728 --> 00:44:52.717
though it does not appear to be sentences

00:44:52.718 --> 00:44:54.537
more than just elements of some of the language

00:44:54.538 --> 00:44:56.987
you've seen before scattered amongst

00:44:56.988 --> 00:44:58.567
the temple itself.

00:44:58.568 --> 00:44:59.767
"The temple."

00:44:59.768 --> 00:45:00.601
It looks temple-y.
LAURA: Any things we would recognize

00:45:00.602 --> 00:45:03.281
from words we've already read?

00:45:03.282 --> 00:45:04.851
MATT: Not in particular, no,

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.140
but you can make a perception check

00:45:08.141 --> 00:45:09.437
if you want to peer through one crack

00:45:09.438 --> 00:45:11.167
that has a slight opening in it

00:45:11.168 --> 00:45:12.241
to see what's inside.

00:45:17.878 --> 00:45:18.711
LAURA: (laughs)

00:45:18.712 --> 00:45:20.649
SAM: It's a locker room, they're changing.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.391
LAURA: Is it perception?

00:45:22.392 --> 00:45:23.932
MATT: Do you have darkvision?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:45:23.933 --> 00:45:25.584
MATT: Yeah, it's perception.

00:45:26.548 --> 00:45:27.548
LAURA: 26.

00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:28.691
MATT: 26, not bad.

00:45:29.853 --> 00:45:32.717
Glancing inside, you don't see much,

00:45:32.718 --> 00:45:37.097
but you see a lot of tumbled structure,

00:45:37.098 --> 00:45:42.098
and fallen shelves and slabs and decoration.

00:45:42.248 --> 00:45:45.487
It looks like when this temple, the structure, settled,

00:45:45.488 --> 00:45:49.477
many things from probably higher up and within it fell

00:45:49.478 --> 00:45:51.297
and collapsed into a central space.

00:45:51.298 --> 00:45:53.377
And from what you can glance in and see,

00:45:53.378 --> 00:45:56.789
part of the floor has fallen in as well.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.067
From the exterior, it looks like it sustained some damage,

00:45:59.068 --> 00:46:00.877
on the inside, it looks like it's even more of a mess.

00:46:00.878 --> 00:46:02.901
LAURA: Do I see any movement?

00:46:02.902 --> 00:46:03.917
MATT: You do not currently see any movement.

00:46:03.918 --> 00:46:05.491
LAURA: Do I see any glowies?

00:46:06.718 --> 00:46:08.677
Anything giving off any kind of light source?

00:46:08.678 --> 00:46:10.257
MATT: Nope, it is dark in there.

00:46:10.258 --> 00:46:12.407
You can make out the shape of things with your darkvision,

00:46:12.408 --> 00:46:13.947
but nothing else is catching your attention

00:46:13.948 --> 00:46:15.311
through this minute crack.

00:46:16.586 --> 00:46:18.937
LAURA: It looks like the floor has caved in in there.

00:46:18.938 --> 00:46:19.823
LIAM: Can I look?

00:46:19.824 --> 00:46:22.087
LAURA: Yeah, but do you have darkvision?

00:46:22.088 --> 00:46:23.357
LIAM: I have Detect Magic on.

00:46:23.358 --> 00:46:24.577
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:24.578 --> 00:46:27.697
LIAM: Is anything glowing in there to my eye?

00:46:27.698 --> 00:46:29.853
MATT: For 30-foot range?

00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:31.508
LIAM: It is 30-foot, yeah.

00:46:31.509 --> 00:46:33.083
MATT: 30-foot? Yeah.

00:46:33.084 --> 00:46:35.877
You get a very faint magical aura

00:46:35.878 --> 00:46:37.917
from within a structure of the rubble

00:46:37.918 --> 00:46:39.707
down deeper in the floor,

00:46:39.708 --> 00:46:43.117
like just at the edge of that range.

00:46:43.118 --> 00:46:44.918
LIAM: Do I get a flavor for what school?

00:46:45.974 --> 00:46:47.567
MATT: Necromancy.

00:46:47.568 --> 00:46:48.797
LIAM: Hmm?
MATT: Necromancy.

00:46:48.798 --> 00:46:51.127
LIAM: Oh, good.
LAURA: (unhappy noises)

00:46:51.128 --> 00:46:51.965
LIAM: That's my favorite.

00:46:51.966 --> 00:46:54.048
MATT: (laughs)

00:46:55.411 --> 00:46:56.260
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:56.261 --> 00:46:59.548
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to
step to the edge of this,

00:47:00.388 --> 00:47:03.957
where everyone else is, and Eyes of the Grave,

00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:05.717
60 feet undead.

00:47:05.718 --> 00:47:06.761
MATT: That you can see?

00:47:09.748 --> 00:47:12.197
TALIESIN: I will know the location
of any undead within 60 feet

00:47:12.198 --> 00:47:14.607
that isn't behind total cover

00:47:14.608 --> 00:47:16.917
or that isn't protected from divination.

00:47:16.918 --> 00:47:18.317
MATT: Correct.

00:47:18.318 --> 00:47:20.997
From where you are currently, you don't sense anything.

00:47:20.998 --> 00:47:22.689
TALIESIN: Looking down, nothing?

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:24.249
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:47:25.978 --> 00:47:26.811
TALIESIN: For fun.

00:47:27.869 --> 00:47:28.702
28.

00:47:28.703 --> 00:47:30.467
MATT: 28.

00:47:30.468 --> 00:47:31.328
Pretty solid look,

00:47:31.329 --> 00:47:32.627
though there is no light source inside,

00:47:32.628 --> 00:47:34.593
and you did not have darkvision.

00:47:34.594 --> 00:47:36.307
So you need to roll again.

00:47:36.308 --> 00:47:37.566
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:47:39.674 --> 00:47:41.139
29. So 28.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.697
MATT: So 28, yeah.

00:47:42.698 --> 00:47:43.588
Yeah, you glance around,

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:45.127
you see the same thing that Jester saw,

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:47.507
though it's still hard to make out details

00:47:47.508 --> 00:47:48.953
with almost no light in there whatsoever.

00:47:48.954 --> 00:47:51.245
TALIESIN: But the Detect Undead isn't getting any?

00:47:51.246 --> 00:47:53.643
MATT: Not at the moment.
Not from this perspective, nothing.

00:47:53.644 --> 00:47:54.688
TRAVIS: That total cover thing.

00:47:54.689 --> 00:47:56.796
SAM: Okay, okay. Mighty Nein check in.

00:47:56.797 --> 00:47:58.329
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay, huddle up.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:00.031
SAM: Huddle up, huddle up.

00:48:00.032 --> 00:48:01.632
Something's in there.
MARISHA: Yes.

00:48:01.633 --> 00:48:03.128
SAM: Probably not the Tomb Takers.

00:48:03.129 --> 00:48:04.544
LAURA: We don't know.
MARISHA: Probably something bad.

00:48:04.545 --> 00:48:05.957
SAM: Probably not the Tomb Takers.

00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:08.591
So we either smartly leave,

00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:12.937
or we go inside. (laughs)

00:48:12.938 --> 00:48:13.778
MARISHA: Well--
SAM: Check it out.

00:48:13.779 --> 00:48:15.376
TALIESIN: Or we play with Plan B.

00:48:15.377 --> 00:48:16.218
TRAVIS: Do we think the way they went

00:48:16.219 --> 00:48:19.417
is down through the sinkhole or through the building?

00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:20.887
TRAVIS: And we have to go through anyway?

00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:22.778
ASHLEY: We should probably just check.

00:48:22.779 --> 00:48:23.864
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:48:23.865 --> 00:48:24.977
MARISHA: Yasha!

00:48:24.978 --> 00:48:26.777
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I just--

00:48:26.778 --> 00:48:28.695
TRAVIS: Miss "I want to keep playing some more!"

00:48:28.696 --> 00:48:30.274
at the end of every game.

00:48:30.275 --> 00:48:31.407
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Hey man,

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:32.542
I'm making up for lost time.

00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:34.208
TRAVIS: I know it. I know it.

00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:37.827
LIAM: It's also believable they've been here before--
MARISHA: New "Press the Button" person.

00:48:37.828 --> 00:48:40.617
LIAM: They figured out how to navigate this place,

00:48:40.618 --> 00:48:41.927
so if there's dead things down there,

00:48:41.928 --> 00:48:43.672
it doesn't mean that they didn't go that way.

00:48:43.673 --> 00:48:46.018
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:48:46.019 --> 00:48:50.310
SAM: Should we send in a scout,

00:48:50.311 --> 00:48:51.510
a Frump,

00:48:51.511 --> 00:48:54.631
or an invisible me, or both?

00:48:55.638 --> 00:48:58.329
Or should we just go in guns blazing?

00:48:58.330 --> 00:48:59.847
LIAM: Well, Frumpkin's not going to be able to see anything.

00:48:59.848 --> 00:49:01.687
LAURA: Oh, because he can't see in the dark?

00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:03.284
Can you put the goggles on Frumpkin?

00:49:03.285 --> 00:49:04.499
SAM: (laughs)

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.274
That would be adorable.
MARISHA: Why have we never tried that?

00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:08.597
LIAM: Meow!
ASHLEY: That would be very cute.

00:49:08.598 --> 00:49:09.523
MARISHA: Can we do that?

00:49:09.524 --> 00:49:11.154
SAM: Does Sprinkle have darkvision?

00:49:11.155 --> 00:49:13.628
LAURA: But we might lose the--
MATT: You could certainly try.

00:49:14.049 --> 00:49:14.882
TALIESIN: Mm.

00:49:14.883 --> 00:49:16.528
MARISHA: I really like these goggles.
LAURA: Sprinkle is a weasel.

00:49:16.529 --> 00:49:17.821
Weasels don't have darkvision.

00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:19.258
SAM: Ah.

00:49:19.259 --> 00:49:20.489
MARISHA: Is there any-- so we're kind of--

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.780
LAURA: But zombies do!

00:49:21.781 --> 00:49:23.838
MARISHA: We're at the end of the road.

00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:25.538
MATT: The road continues.

00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:27.318
To the left of the road is this structure.

00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:30.068
The blood splatters stopped on the road path.

00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:31.661
There is this massive structure right there,

00:49:31.662 --> 00:49:34.628
this temple-like tower that has fallen into a sinkhole

00:49:34.629 --> 00:49:36.368
and turned to its side.

00:49:36.369 --> 00:49:40.208
It looks like it's about maybe 120 feet from side to side

00:49:40.209 --> 00:49:42.688
from one edge of the tower to the other,

00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:44.228
maybe a little bit smaller.

00:49:44.229 --> 00:49:46.996
And you guys just went through

00:49:46.997 --> 00:49:48.348
the pale garden portion.

00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:49.748
You're up against the outer wall.

00:49:49.749 --> 00:49:50.868
MARISHA: What keeps going?

00:49:50.869 --> 00:49:52.198
If continued on this road.

00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:54.178
LAURA: Yeah, if we didn't go down the tower.

00:49:54.179 --> 00:49:56.888
MATT: The path that you guys were walking, the city path

00:49:56.889 --> 00:49:58.558
that winds and breaks

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.728
and is disheveled and uneven in places

00:50:00.729 --> 00:50:04.778
from the destruction and the impact of the city of Aeor

00:50:04.779 --> 00:50:07.688
continues on in a southeastern direction

00:50:07.689 --> 00:50:09.578
through neighborhoods, through structures

00:50:09.579 --> 00:50:13.018
towards a heavy slate ceiling

00:50:13.019 --> 00:50:16.530
that descends to clip off the edge of this ward.

00:50:16.531 --> 00:50:17.948
LIAM: We check it and go,
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:17.949 --> 00:50:19.508
LIAM: We've got to check it and go.

00:50:19.509 --> 00:50:21.903
MARISHA: I mean, if it's at the end of the road.

00:50:21.904 --> 00:50:24.949
TALIESIN: We could talk to a severed head.

00:50:26.001 --> 00:50:27.141
LAURA: You can do that right now?

00:50:27.142 --> 00:50:27.981
TALIESIN: I can do that right now.

00:50:27.982 --> 00:50:29.280
MARISHA: Do you want to talk to a severed head

00:50:29.281 --> 00:50:33.488
while Veth and I get to the end of the tunnel

00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:35.562
and see what it is and come right back?

00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:38.618
LAURA: The tunnel, you mean the path?

00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:39.526
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:50:40.862 --> 00:50:42.427
TALIESIN: You have five questions?
MARISHA: Go up a little bit?

00:50:42.428 --> 00:50:43.578
ASHLEY: Multitask?

00:50:43.579 --> 00:50:45.235
MARISHA: Multitask, yeah.

00:50:46.459 --> 00:50:48.098
SAM: Sure.

00:50:48.099 --> 00:50:50.749
LAURA: Don't come running back with a monster chasing you.

00:50:51.628 --> 00:50:53.178
MARISHA: What happens?
LAURA: I have experience with this.

00:50:53.179 --> 00:50:54.170
It's not good.

00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:55.368
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:50:55.369 --> 00:50:56.202
Oh yeah.

00:50:57.579 --> 00:50:58.412
Heard stories.

00:50:58.413 --> 00:51:00.088
All right, let's go.

00:51:00.089 --> 00:51:01.888
SAM: Yeah, you have the goggles still, right?

00:51:01.889 --> 00:51:02.799
Because I can't see shit.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.909
MARISHA: I do still have the goggles.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.281
SAM: Okay, cool.

00:51:05.282 --> 00:51:07.658
MARISHA: And you can be invisible or whatever.

00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:09.378
SAM: I mean, sure.
MARISHA: If you need to.

00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:10.212
If we need to.

00:51:10.212 --> 00:51:11.049
SAM: Then I won't be able to see

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:12.538
and you won't be able to see me.

00:51:12.539 --> 00:51:13.938
MARISHA: Yeah, only if we need to.

00:51:13.939 --> 00:51:14.956
Only if shit hits the fan.
LAURA: What's the point of you going

00:51:14.957 --> 00:51:15.819
if you can't see anything?

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.097
SAM: To protect.

00:51:17.098 --> 00:51:21.719
(laughter)

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.838
MARISHA: We should have brought Yasha. Let's go.

00:51:23.839 --> 00:51:25.208
Let's go.
ASHLEY: Can I go, actually?

00:51:25.209 --> 00:51:26.242
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

00:51:26.243 --> 00:51:27.226
SAM: Who's asking?

00:51:27.227 --> 00:51:29.888
LAURA: Maybe just hold her hand, just hold hands.

00:51:29.889 --> 00:51:31.578
LIAM: I give her the driftglobe.

00:51:31.579 --> 00:51:33.598
Don't light it up unless you absolutely need it.

00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:36.038
But if you start to get eaten, you know, light it up.

00:51:36.039 --> 00:51:37.658
SAM: Thank you.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:37.659 --> 00:51:38.677
SAM: How do I do it?

00:51:38.678 --> 00:51:39.848
Is it think of is it a word?

00:51:39.849 --> 00:51:40.948
LIAM: Yeah, you just think.

00:51:40.949 --> 00:51:42.288
SAM: Awesome.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:42.289 --> 00:51:43.122
SAM: Let's rumble.

00:51:43.123 --> 00:51:44.141
MARISHA: All right.

00:51:44.142 --> 00:51:45.570
MATT: All right, I need both of you

00:51:45.571 --> 00:51:47.021
to make stealth checks, please.

00:51:49.355 --> 00:51:51.318
MARISHA: Lucky jade, lucky jade.

00:51:51.319 --> 00:51:52.808
SAM: 27.

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:53.642
MARISHA: 17.

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:55.298
MATT: 17, okay.

00:51:55.299 --> 00:51:56.878
You both continue following the path

00:51:56.879 --> 00:51:58.648
that you were already traveling in the direction

00:51:58.649 --> 00:52:01.508
where you believe the blood splatters were headed

00:52:01.509 --> 00:52:02.422
before they ended.

00:52:03.317 --> 00:52:05.229
MARISHA: Keeping an eye out for footsteps while we go.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.408
MATT: Indeed.
MARISHA: Continue.

00:52:06.409 --> 00:52:08.158
MATT: We'll get to you guys in just a minute.

00:52:08.159 --> 00:52:09.328
What are the rest of you doing?

00:52:09.329 --> 00:52:11.098
LAURA: He's talking to a dead head.

00:52:11.099 --> 00:52:12.206
TALIESIN: Let's pick a head.
MATT: Okay.

00:52:12.207 --> 00:52:13.618
TALIESIN: I could use a few more questions

00:52:13.619 --> 00:52:14.593
if anybody has any.

00:52:14.594 --> 00:52:16.274
ASHLEY: Which one do you want?

00:52:16.275 --> 00:52:18.027
MARISHA: Just for fun this time, though.

00:52:18.028 --> 00:52:22.112
LIAM: Where do you go in the city to access Lucien's goal?

00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:26.358
How much time does Lucien need

00:52:26.359 --> 00:52:30.463
to do what he's going to do at destination?

00:52:33.281 --> 00:52:35.308
LAURA: What do the eyes mean?

00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:37.256
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good one.

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.345
LAURA: I don't think he's going to talk to us.

00:52:40.346 --> 00:52:41.395
TALIESIN: I'll do that one last.

00:52:41.396 --> 00:52:42.936
LAURA: Or if it does,

00:52:42.937 --> 00:52:45.387
I don't think they're going to even be aware of--

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:48.989
TALIESIN: There's a lot you can do.

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.931
TRAVIS: Tyffial was the elf,

00:52:49.932 --> 00:52:52.581
Otis was the halfling mage, right?

00:52:53.529 --> 00:52:56.568
You probably want someone with a mind

00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:58.068
of what the overall plan was

00:52:58.069 --> 00:53:00.818
in case one knew more than the other.

00:53:00.819 --> 00:53:01.669
TALIESIN: We'll find out.

00:53:02.674 --> 00:53:04.243
MARISHA: Who you talking to?

00:53:04.244 --> 00:53:05.077
TALIESIN: Pick a head.

00:53:05.077 --> 00:53:05.910
ASHLEY: Yeah, who do you want?

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:06.759
LIAM: Actually you have to say--
TRAVIS: That's what I was saying.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.760
LIAM: -- "tawaj."
TRAVIS: Do we want to do the elven--

00:53:08.761 --> 00:53:09.868
SAM: Tawhaj?
LIAM: Tawhaj.

00:53:09.869 --> 00:53:10.702
ASHLEY: Who's the third one?

00:53:10.702 --> 00:53:11.541
TRAVIS: -- archer, or crossbow? The thing,

00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:12.374
maybe was a ranger?
LAURA: The third one was

00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:13.950
the goliath.

00:53:13.951 --> 00:53:14.784
TRAVIS: Zoran.
MATT: Yeah.

00:53:14.785 --> 00:53:15.933
LAURA: Zoran.
MATT: Goliath, the elf,

00:53:15.934 --> 00:53:16.767
and the halfling.

00:53:16.768 --> 00:53:18.708
LAURA: Well, Zoran I do have a good relationship with.

00:53:18.709 --> 00:53:19.791
LIAM: "Fajar" for Daylight.

00:53:19.792 --> 00:53:20.769
TALIESIN: I have a plan.

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:23.778
I'm going to make myself look like Cree.

00:53:23.779 --> 00:53:25.468
SAM: Great, got it, giraffe and?

00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:26.763
LIAM: Owha tagoo siam.

00:53:26.764 --> 00:53:27.942
ASHLEY: Good idea.
TALIESIN: Weird.

00:53:29.719 --> 00:53:31.819
TRAVIS: Complete with eyes and everything?

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.653
Love it.

00:53:34.889 --> 00:53:36.248
TALIESIN: So we pick a head.

00:53:36.249 --> 00:53:37.199
LAURA: Well then--

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.649
SAM: Which head are you picking?

00:53:39.938 --> 00:53:42.703
TRAVIS: Otis was the halfling mage,

00:53:42.704 --> 00:53:45.242
Tyffial was the elven ranger.

00:53:45.243 --> 00:53:47.017
TALIESIN: I think Otis is the way to go.

00:53:47.018 --> 00:53:49.925
Unless anyone's got a compelling reason not to.

00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:51.525
LAURA: If the elf was the ranger,

00:53:51.526 --> 00:53:52.831
they usually know the path.

00:53:52.832 --> 00:53:53.665
TALIESIN: Fair point.

00:53:55.529 --> 00:53:56.552
TALIESIN: Okay.
TRAVIS: Had a crossbow,

00:53:56.553 --> 00:53:58.718
I'm assuming a ranger thing, so.

00:53:58.719 --> 00:54:01.228
TALIESIN: I'm going to set that head up.

00:54:01.229 --> 00:54:02.234
MATT: Which one, the elf?

00:54:02.235 --> 00:54:03.068
TALIESIN: The elf.

00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:04.240
MATT: All right, so Tyffial.
LAURA: Is the elf--

00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:05.456
SAM: Wait, who's the elf?

00:54:05.457 --> 00:54:07.138
TRAVIS and MATT: Tyffial.
LAURA: Tyffial.

00:54:07.139 --> 00:54:09.615
SAM: I thought that was a human.

00:54:11.132 --> 00:54:13.698
TALIESIN: And I'm going to cast Speak with Dead.

00:54:13.699 --> 00:54:14.549
MATT: All right.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:18.098
The head itself spattered with its own gore.

00:54:18.099 --> 00:54:20.168
One of the eyes a little cloudy

00:54:20.169 --> 00:54:22.607
upon closer inspection to the individual.

00:54:23.615 --> 00:54:25.738
As you finish channeling

00:54:25.739 --> 00:54:27.308
the Wild Mother's energy through you

00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:31.716
to take hold of this no longer warm,

00:54:31.717 --> 00:54:33.099
breathing body,

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:37.828
this head that once housed the soul of this individual.

00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:39.878
The eyes looking off into the darkness

00:54:39.879 --> 00:54:44.879
suddenly go over and focus onto you.

00:54:45.136 --> 00:54:47.840
And the mouth seems to pull into a mild grin.

00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:57.104
TALIESIN: Do you remember going down and through

00:54:57.105 --> 00:54:59.563
this tower before?

00:55:01.459 --> 00:55:03.276
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:55:03.277 --> 00:55:05.355
TALIESIN: Oh fuck, man.

00:55:05.356 --> 00:55:07.489
LAURA: Oh no. Can I give--

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:09.730
MATT: You will have--
LAURA: -- give him Guidance?

00:55:09.731 --> 00:55:11.371
MATT: What's up?
LAURA: Can I give him Guidance?

00:55:11.372 --> 00:55:14.631
Can I just have my foot touch his foot

00:55:14.632 --> 00:55:15.618
and give him Guidance?

00:55:15.619 --> 00:55:17.738
MATT: (laughs) Not for this question.

00:55:17.739 --> 00:55:19.388
TALIESIN: I was planning on giving myself Guidance,

00:55:19.389 --> 00:55:21.118
but yeah, I forgot, so.

00:55:21.119 --> 00:55:22.501
MATT: Yeah, you did.

00:55:22.502 --> 00:55:25.238
But you do get advantage because you do look like Cree.

00:55:25.239 --> 00:55:26.489
LAURA: Okay, okay, that's good.

00:55:28.896 --> 00:55:29.729
TALIESIN: Ooh!

00:55:30.629 --> 00:55:31.462
Thank god.

00:55:32.819 --> 00:55:34.168
20.

00:55:34.169 --> 00:55:35.002
MATT: 20.

00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:42.518
One eye kind of twitches for a second.

00:55:42.519 --> 00:55:44.402
"Not exactly.

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:49.052
"Why would we?"

00:55:54.229 --> 00:55:55.979
TALIESIN: Which way did we go

00:55:57.646 --> 00:56:00.421
to get to our destination?

00:56:01.379 --> 00:56:03.287
MATT: Make another deception check.
TALIESIN: Fuck.

00:56:03.288 --> 00:56:04.328
MARISHA: Come on, come on.
TALIESIN: With advantage?

00:56:04.329 --> 00:56:06.298
MATT: This one with advantage as well,

00:56:06.299 --> 00:56:07.608
because you are asking questions

00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:11.138
that Cree would likely have known, and--

00:56:11.139 --> 00:56:12.778
TALIESIN: 23. Hmm.

00:56:12.779 --> 00:56:13.895
MATT: Nice.

00:56:15.009 --> 00:56:15.842
Remind me of the question again.

00:56:15.843 --> 00:56:17.398
It was specifically--?

00:56:17.399 --> 00:56:19.641
TALIESIN: Which direction--

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:20.724
LAURA: I think you said, which way did we go?

00:56:20.725 --> 00:56:21.808
TALIESIN: Which way did we go

00:56:21.809 --> 00:56:24.225
originally to get to our destination?

00:56:25.759 --> 00:56:28.918
MATT: One eye continues focused on you

00:56:28.919 --> 00:56:32.868
and the less cloudy one shifts back

00:56:32.869 --> 00:56:35.369
towards the road where you were already traveling.

00:56:38.759 --> 00:56:39.592
TRAVIS: Hmm.

00:56:41.169 --> 00:56:42.002
TALIESIN: Very good.

00:56:44.139 --> 00:56:48.702
Remember, how long did it take to get there?

00:56:50.969 --> 00:56:53.150
MATT: Roll another deception check.
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

00:56:53.151 --> 00:56:54.650
LIAM: This is good, you've already got

00:56:54.651 --> 00:56:56.103
creative advantage.
MARISHA: Come on, this is the best lying

00:56:56.104 --> 00:56:57.136
you've ever done.
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:56:57.137 --> 00:56:59.002
ALL: Oh!

00:56:59.003 --> 00:56:59.836
LIAM: Shit!

00:56:59.837 --> 00:57:01.013
TRAVIS: Let's go, Undeadwood!

00:57:01.014 --> 00:57:01.847
MARISHA: Caddy!

00:57:01.848 --> 00:57:02.852
TRAVIS: [inaudible]

00:57:02.853 --> 00:57:04.198
MATT: For a total of?

00:57:04.199 --> 00:57:05.368
TALIESIN: 23.

00:57:05.369 --> 00:57:06.396
MATT: 23.
TRAVIS: He lives!

00:57:06.397 --> 00:57:08.069
LIAM: That elf got big Lebowski'd.

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:10.245
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

00:57:16.744 --> 00:57:19.277
MATT: "Bit hazy, but

00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.568
"about a day or so."

00:57:27.964 --> 00:57:29.506
SAM: Did he say bidet?

00:57:31.178 --> 00:57:33.488
MATT: "Bidet."

00:57:33.489 --> 00:57:34.789
ASHLEY: (like Grog) Bidet.

00:57:38.519 --> 00:57:39.832
TALIESIN: You're doing so well.

00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:46.472
How long do you expect the ritual to take?

00:57:48.992 --> 00:57:50.932
MATT: "I don't know."

00:57:53.859 --> 00:57:57.002
TALIESIN: And what do the eyes mean to you?

00:57:58.469 --> 00:58:01.468
MATT: Now make a deception check, last time.

00:58:01.469 --> 00:58:02.854
LIAM: Come on.

00:58:02.855 --> 00:58:04.188
TALIESIN: 15.

00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:05.408
LIAM: Okay.

00:58:05.409 --> 00:58:07.758
MATT: Both eyes narrow for a second

00:58:07.759 --> 00:58:11.967
and the head just goes-- (cackles)

00:58:13.482 --> 00:58:15.368
(louder cackling)

00:58:15.369 --> 00:58:16.989
TALIESIN: Decompose.
MATT: (gurgles)

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:21.990
(laughter)

00:58:22.339 --> 00:58:23.448
TALIESIN: Well, that was irritating.

00:58:23.449 --> 00:58:25.831
LAURA: That was so good, Caduceus.
LIAM: That was dope.

00:58:25.832 --> 00:58:27.188
LAURA: That was the best you've ever lied before.

00:58:27.189 --> 00:58:30.043
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was thinking instead of lying

00:58:30.044 --> 00:58:31.558
I was going to try acting,

00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:33.508
which is kind of-- I mean, they're different,

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:34.858
but it feels different.

00:58:34.859 --> 00:58:36.241
So I was feeling pretty good about that.

00:58:36.242 --> 00:58:37.685
ASHLEY: Maybe you were shipped to the amphitheater.

00:58:37.686 --> 00:58:38.519
LIAM: Similar, though.

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.208
TALIESIN: You know, I was thinking about making some improv

00:58:40.209 --> 00:58:41.138
if all of this works out.

00:58:41.139 --> 00:58:42.395
ASHLEY: Oh, fun!

00:58:42.396 --> 00:58:43.319
I'd like to join.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.358
TALIESIN: I should meet some new people.

00:58:44.359 --> 00:58:45.192
You're all great,

00:58:45.193 --> 00:58:47.360
but I should probably meet some new people, too.

00:58:47.361 --> 00:58:48.751
ASHLEY: Well, yeah.

00:58:48.752 --> 00:58:50.379
SAM: So good at improv.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.456
(laughter)

00:58:52.457 --> 00:58:54.238
TRAVIS: "Yes, and."

00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:55.325
TALIESIN: No.

00:58:55.326 --> 00:58:57.170
MARISHA: (laughs) Just stops there.

00:58:57.171 --> 00:58:58.138
LAURA: Yes, and.

00:58:58.139 --> 00:59:00.379
ASHLEY: Yes, also. Is that how it is?
TALIESIN: And.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:03.658
(laughter)

00:59:03.659 --> 00:59:05.613
So that's a little bit of information.

00:59:05.614 --> 00:59:07.012
LIAM: Yes, that's a lot of information.

00:59:07.013 --> 00:59:10.558
TRAVIS: They pulled over for a pit stop, healed possibly,

00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:12.538
and then kept going.

00:59:12.539 --> 00:59:13.419
They didn't go this way.

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:14.898
LIAM: They could have just come within the wall, right?

00:59:14.899 --> 00:59:15.732
Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:15.733 --> 00:59:17.139
LIAM: Let's wait for our buddies.

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:17.979
LAURA: This is something to avoid.

00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.228
This is something that will just hurt us for nothing.

00:59:20.229 --> 00:59:23.778
LIAM: Yeah, now cross your fingers they don't wake up--

00:59:23.779 --> 00:59:25.818
LAURA: Let's back away slowly from this tower

00:59:25.819 --> 00:59:27.038
since it does no good.

00:59:27.039 --> 00:59:29.378
TALIESIN: I still want to go the amphitheater, I'm feeling--

00:59:29.379 --> 00:59:31.679
LIAM: I pull out a wire and say:

00:59:32.719 --> 00:59:34.768
We have very good information that says

00:59:34.769 --> 00:59:37.838
that this was a pit stop and not the final destination.

00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:41.058
Please, if you can avoid confrontation, do so.

00:59:41.059 --> 00:59:43.553
You can reply to this message.

00:59:43.554 --> 00:59:46.562
SAM: Strong copy unless we're more than 120 feet away.

00:59:47.759 --> 00:59:50.098
MATT: I'd say, based on the length of that conversation,

00:59:50.099 --> 00:59:51.099
probably.

00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.989
So you're out of the range.

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:55.138
SAM: (whistles)

00:59:55.139 --> 00:59:57.058
MATT: Stealthily whistling

00:59:57.059 --> 00:59:59.021
as you travel through the darkness.

00:59:59.022 --> 01:00:01.171
LIAM: I hit the wire a few times, hello?

01:00:01.172 --> 01:00:02.438
(laughter)

01:00:02.439 --> 01:00:03.904
TRAVIS: Oh no.
ASHLEY: Veth, please bring

01:00:03.905 --> 01:00:07.248
my girlfriend back right now.

01:00:07.249 --> 01:00:08.159
SAM: Okay.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.381
ASHLEY: Probably listen to me.

01:00:09.382 --> 01:00:11.465
MATT: (laughs)

01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:14.101
MARISHA: Grandma Yasha.

01:00:14.102 --> 01:00:15.928
(laughter)

01:00:15.929 --> 01:00:17.038
MATT: Is there anything else you wish to do

01:00:17.039 --> 01:00:20.452
while you wait for your compatriots to return, hopefully?

01:00:22.766 --> 01:00:24.818
LIAM: I'm going to ritual cast Comprehend Languages,

01:00:24.819 --> 01:00:28.028
so I can read the words that
I couldn't read on this building.

01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.862
MATT: Okay.

01:00:28.863 --> 01:00:31.358
LAURA: Maybe you can Identify that robe

01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:34.298
that Yasha brought the whole tower down for.

01:00:34.299 --> 01:00:37.308
LIAM: Yeah, so Comprehend Languages.

01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:38.142
MATT: All right.

01:00:38.143 --> 01:00:40.479
MATT: That takes you 10 minutes?

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.987
TRAVIS: What are your hit points at now?

01:00:41.988 --> 01:00:44.620
LAURA: I'm on 116 out of 140 right now.

01:00:44.621 --> 01:00:45.454
MARISHA: Polyester.

01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:47.288
LAURA: And I don't have any hit points to regain

01:00:47.289 --> 01:00:48.149
from the short resting.

01:00:48.149 --> 01:00:48.982
I've used them all.

01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:51.318
TRAVIS: I'll cast Cure Wounds at 1st-level,

01:00:51.319 --> 01:00:52.355
which is just one d8.
MARISHA: Don't get it

01:00:52.356 --> 01:00:53.450
near an open flame.
TRAVIS: -- plus five.

01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:54.766
LAURA: Fjord, you don't have to do that.

01:00:54.767 --> 01:00:55.833
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a 1st-level spell.

01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:57.992
I'm not going to really use it anyway.

01:00:57.993 --> 01:00:59.011
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:00:59.012 --> 01:01:01.398
TRAVIS: I mean, I probably wouldn't.

01:01:01.399 --> 01:01:02.646
LIAM: Oh, good roll says D&amp;D Beyond.

01:01:02.647 --> 01:01:04.572
SAM: Yeah, what the hell?

01:01:05.459 --> 01:01:06.409
TALIESIN: That would be susceptible to--

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:07.638
TRAVIS: Oh, why did I roll?

01:01:07.639 --> 01:01:08.838
TALIESIN: -- double damage.

01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:09.709
TRAVIS: 13.

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:10.890
MARISHA: Melts onto your body.
LAURA: 13.

01:01:10.891 --> 01:01:12.987
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Thank you, Fjord.

01:01:12.988 --> 01:01:14.188
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

01:01:14.189 --> 01:01:15.706
LAURA: I feel better already.

01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:18.868
ASHLEY: While we're here--
SAM: (whispers) Make out.

01:01:18.869 --> 01:01:22.062
ASHLEY: -- do you want me to go in
and check inside the building?

01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:27.578
LAURA: We're just the worst kissers ever.

01:01:27.579 --> 01:01:29.313
ASHLEY: That was a joke.

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:31.071
MARISHA: They're making out.

01:01:31.072 --> 01:01:34.888
TRAVIS: Yasha, I think there was
a silver robe inside the building.

01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:36.283
You should go get it.

01:01:36.284 --> 01:01:37.638
ASHLEY: I mean, I could keep looking around

01:01:37.639 --> 01:01:38.888
so I could get one for all of us.

01:01:38.889 --> 01:01:41.748
TRAVIS: Strangely, it was the other half
of the one that you have,

01:01:41.749 --> 01:01:43.648
what are the odds?
SAM: Kiss her.

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:45.278
LIAM: The power robe.

01:01:45.279 --> 01:01:46.557
Legendary.

01:01:46.558 --> 01:01:48.728
LAURA: Seriously though, you should Identify it.

01:01:48.729 --> 01:01:50.880
She worked so hard to get it.

01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:54.778
LIAM: I'm one minute into casting Comprehend Languages.

01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:56.868
LAURA: Caleb, when you're done with this ritual cast,

01:01:56.869 --> 01:01:58.508
you should really work on Identifying

01:01:58.509 --> 01:01:59.624
the robe for Yasha

01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:01.118
because she worked--
LIAM: I'm trying to say the

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:03.928
incantations of the spell.
LAURA: -- really hard on getting it.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:05.150
LIAM: This goes to that one

01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:06.810
and that goes to this one.
ASHLEY: I put the robe on.

01:02:06.811 --> 01:02:08.333
LAURA: No, what if it's cursed?

01:02:08.334 --> 01:02:09.259
ASHLEY: Is anything happening?

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.864
TRAVIS: Wondrous item chill.

01:02:10.865 --> 01:02:11.875
MATT: Yasha.

01:02:11.876 --> 01:02:12.889
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Oh no.

01:02:15.009 --> 01:02:15.842
MATT: It looks great.

01:02:15.843 --> 01:02:18.899
(laughter)

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.413
SAM: You look fabulous.

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:23.648
MATT: At least what remains of it.

01:02:23.649 --> 01:02:25.147
Which actually, in its torn way,

01:02:25.148 --> 01:02:28.468
it probably was a very subdued,

01:02:28.469 --> 01:02:30.718
if well-made robe in its heyday.

01:02:30.719 --> 01:02:33.738
On you, it looks like a cool vintage find

01:02:33.739 --> 01:02:36.378
that you tore the bottom out of to make it more your style.

01:02:36.379 --> 01:02:37.838
LAURA: Ooh, yeah.

01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:39.555
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep it on.

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:41.997
Maybe something will happen, you know.

01:02:41.998 --> 01:02:43.768
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: They sell those on Melrose.

01:02:43.769 --> 01:02:44.602
MATT: Yeah.

01:02:44.602 --> 01:02:45.435
ASHLEY: What's Melrose?

01:02:46.439 --> 01:02:48.838
LAURA: There's one rip that's just not working

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:49.672
with the rest of it.

01:02:49.672 --> 01:02:50.505
It doesn't look like it goes

01:02:50.506 --> 01:02:51.958
so I'm just going to use Mending cantrip

01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:54.778
to just piece this one little part back together.

01:02:54.779 --> 01:02:55.779
So, you know.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.923
ASHLEY: Yeah, that looks way better.

01:02:57.924 --> 01:02:59.298
LAURA: It looks intentional now, not--

01:02:59.299 --> 01:03:02.078
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like it was supposed to be like this.

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:04.143
Thank you.
MATT: Make a concentration check for me.

01:03:04.144 --> 01:03:05.085
LAURA: Oh.

01:03:05.086 --> 01:03:07.532
(laughter)

01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:10.813
MATT: Constitution--
LIAM: Oh, I have advantage on concentration,

01:03:10.814 --> 01:03:12.225
thank god.
MATT: You do?

01:03:12.226 --> 01:03:13.059
SAM: In battle.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.015
LIAM: Oh, I rolled the same thing twice.

01:03:16.016 --> 01:03:16.849
11.

01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:17.682
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

01:03:17.682 --> 01:03:18.657
LIAM: Okay.

01:03:18.658 --> 01:03:19.998
(laughter)

01:03:19.999 --> 01:03:20.931
TALIESIN: That was a great pull.

01:03:20.932 --> 01:03:23.410
LAURA: He's had way worse distractions for his spells,

01:03:23.411 --> 01:03:25.518
let's be honest.
MATT: It's true.

01:03:25.519 --> 01:03:27.319
I know, but it's just fun to fuck with him.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.047
LIAM: This is why you are so charming.

01:03:31.048 --> 01:03:31.927
(poofing)

01:03:31.928 --> 01:03:34.308
MATT: You finish the Comprehend Languages spell.

01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:35.478
As you glance over at the wall,

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:39.902
you begin to notice it's mostly not languages.

01:03:40.839 --> 01:03:42.090
They're names.

01:03:43.939 --> 01:03:46.289
Numerous names, hundreds of names

01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:52.206
lining the edges of this standing structure.

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:54.291
SAM: Could be the donors who've paid for it to be built.

01:03:54.292 --> 01:03:56.066
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

01:03:56.067 --> 01:03:57.218
(laughter)

01:03:57.219 --> 01:04:01.538
MATT: There is the partially broken in heavy doors

01:04:01.539 --> 01:04:03.588
towards one side, the closest side to you.

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:05.568
As you glance over and check

01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:10.251
it reads as the Aeorian phrase for

01:04:10.252 --> 01:04:12.234
"Mausoleum of the Forgotten."

01:04:12.235 --> 01:04:16.588
LIAM: This is the Mark Taper Mausoleum of Aeor.

01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:18.202
ASHLEY: The Robert Zemeckis Amphitheater.

01:04:18.203 --> 01:04:20.098
TRAVIS: That would explain a lot.

01:04:20.099 --> 01:04:20.932
LIAM: Yeah.

01:04:20.932 --> 01:04:21.765
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:04:21.766 --> 01:04:22.818
ASHLEY: Mausoleum, what was the other part?

01:04:22.819 --> 01:04:25.036
MATT: "Of the Forgotten."

01:04:25.037 --> 01:04:26.568
LAURA: That's really cool.

01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:29.018
TRAVIS: Well, that's a whole--
LAURA: "Of the Forgotten"?

01:04:29.019 --> 01:04:30.948
That makes me sad for them.

01:04:30.949 --> 01:04:32.366
SAM: I'm not there, but--

01:04:33.299 --> 01:04:35.388
TRAVIS: Probably don't need to go in.

01:04:35.389 --> 01:04:37.548
LIAM: It's funny, though,
because the people inside the building

01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:41.248
are just like all the people outside the building now.

01:04:41.249 --> 01:04:42.356
TRAVIS: Very true.

01:04:42.357 --> 01:04:43.690
SAM: "The Forgotten."

01:04:45.559 --> 01:04:48.218
MATT: Now, Veth and Beauregard--

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:50.310
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:52.430
MATT: I would like you both to
make perception checks for me, please.

01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:54.598
SAM: I'm good at that. With disadvantage?

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.099
TRAVIS: -- the rest of the city, is it?

01:04:59.099 --> 01:04:59.932
SAM: Six.

01:04:59.933 --> 01:05:02.470
MARISHA: Mm! 23.

01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:03.928
MATT: Okay.

01:05:03.929 --> 01:05:06.248
As you're both carefully stealthing through,

01:05:06.249 --> 01:05:09.118
you're getting closer to where the cavern ceiling

01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:09.952
is descending,

01:05:09.953 --> 01:05:13.538
where this heavy shelf of stone that is jammed into the city

01:05:13.539 --> 01:05:16.318
bisecting it from the rest of where you imagine

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:17.868
Aeor would continue beyond it.

01:05:17.869 --> 01:05:20.108
You can see where the earth splinters upward,

01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:24.528
impacts these rows of jagged miniature mountains

01:05:24.529 --> 01:05:27.549
that are pushed outward from where it impacts.

01:05:29.282 --> 01:05:32.079
All of a sudden there's something slick under your foot.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.658
Veth.
SAM: Ah!

01:05:33.659 --> 01:05:35.578
MATT: You look down just as you look over

01:05:35.579 --> 01:05:38.282
and you don't want Veth to move.

01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:42.188
MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to reach down and grab her.

01:05:42.189 --> 01:05:43.022
SAM: What's going on?

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:44.568
MARISHA: I don't know, I don't know. What is it?

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:46.268
MATT: You look around

01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:49.958
and you can see there is a mass of dark blood beneath Veth.

01:05:49.959 --> 01:05:51.108
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:52.998
MATT: Liquid.

01:05:52.999 --> 01:05:53.879
MARISHA: What?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.828
MATT: And you glance just beyond where Veth was going

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:59.868
as you've pulled her back.

01:05:59.869 --> 01:06:02.767
And you can see there are two large,

01:06:02.768 --> 01:06:06.338
slumped, unmoving bodies

01:06:06.339 --> 01:06:07.564
on the ground.

01:06:09.669 --> 01:06:12.638
Massive bodies.

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:13.472
SAM: Oh.

01:06:13.473 --> 01:06:16.168
MATT: You can see two large,

01:06:16.169 --> 01:06:18.028
hard to tell details from this side,

01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:21.703
but it looks like two nude,

01:06:21.704 --> 01:06:26.008
maybe very faintly furred,

01:06:26.009 --> 01:06:28.378
bestial, bipedal creatures

01:06:28.379 --> 01:06:31.048
that are just on the ground a bit from you.

01:06:31.049 --> 01:06:34.098
And there's just blood spattered and strewn

01:06:34.099 --> 01:06:35.118
on the ground around you.

01:06:35.119 --> 01:06:37.288
Where it appears like some sort of conflict

01:06:37.289 --> 01:06:38.543
had recently happened.

01:06:38.544 --> 01:06:39.798
MARISHA: And it's super--

01:06:39.799 --> 01:06:41.388
can I reach down and touch the blood?

01:06:41.389 --> 01:06:42.538
It's super warm still?

01:06:42.539 --> 01:06:44.128
MATT: It's not warm.
MARISHA: Fresh?

01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:45.628
MATT: But it's certainly fresh.

01:06:45.629 --> 01:06:49.798
And as you look at it, you have no light source right now.

01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:50.632
Right?

01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:53.138
So you have no coloration to ascertain where--

01:06:53.139 --> 01:06:54.389
SAM: Do you want some light?

01:06:56.071 --> 01:06:57.939
MARISHA: Sure.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.988
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Sure.

01:06:58.989 --> 01:07:00.646
SAM: <i>Tawhaj. Tawhaj?</i>

01:07:00.647 --> 01:07:01.630
<i>Tawhaj?</i>
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:03.077
SAM: <i>Tawhaj</i>!

01:07:03.078 --> 01:07:05.208
And I'll light up the thing.

01:07:05.209 --> 01:07:09.208
MATT: The glow gives off this daylight

01:07:09.209 --> 01:07:10.042
presence around you.
MARISHA: Daylight!

01:07:10.043 --> 01:07:11.883
SAM: No, no, no that's--
LIAM: That's <i>fajar</i>.

01:07:11.884 --> 01:07:13.328
MATT: Sorry, sorry, so just light.
LAURA: Oh my--

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.944
MATT: Sorry, sorry.
TRAVIS: Dude, no, no!

01:07:15.945 --> 01:07:16.786
No <i>tawhaj</i>!

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:20.353
MATT: My apologies for not recalling my elven phrases

01:07:20.354 --> 01:07:21.187
that I handed--

01:07:21.188 --> 01:07:23.898
SAM: That's <i>fajar</i>, Matt, I said <i>tawhaj</i>.

01:07:23.899 --> 01:07:26.324
MATT: You're right, I apologize.

01:07:26.325 --> 01:07:28.442
MARISHA: We're talking like 10 watts.

01:07:28.443 --> 01:07:30.718
MATT: Well, this is a Light cantrip,

01:07:30.719 --> 01:07:32.718
which is the equivalent of torchlight.

01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:34.328
So it lights up the space around you

01:07:34.329 --> 01:07:36.359
and you immediately can see the liquid here

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.580
is a thick, almost purple-black coloration.

01:07:40.809 --> 01:07:43.741
You do see bits of human red,

01:07:43.742 --> 01:07:46.116
humanoid red tossed in places

01:07:46.117 --> 01:07:49.264
and the signs of a serious scuffle transpired here.

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.458
SAM: Ooh.

01:07:50.459 --> 01:07:52.664
MATT: But the bodies are still a little ways ahead.

01:07:52.665 --> 01:07:54.628
SAM: Oh, we're not right on the bodies yet?

01:07:54.629 --> 01:07:56.956
MATT: No, they're about 10, 15 feet ahead of you.

01:07:56.957 --> 01:07:59.608
SAM: I feel like we should definitely go back

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:00.442
and tell the others,

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.862
but we should inspect the bodies just to make sure,

01:08:02.863 --> 01:08:05.698
I don't know, just to know what happened here.

01:08:05.699 --> 01:08:06.532
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

01:08:06.533 --> 01:08:08.748
A little crime scene investigation action real quick.

01:08:08.749 --> 01:08:09.582
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah-- ah, man.

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:11.018
If only I had Jester here.

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:11.852
MARISHA: Oh well--

01:08:11.853 --> 01:08:13.671
SAM: You'll do, you'll do.
MARISHA: If only I had Yasha here.

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:14.534
What the--

01:08:14.535 --> 01:08:17.018
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:08:17.019 --> 01:08:19.028
SAM: All right, all right, it's fine.

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:20.348
We're an unlikely duo

01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:22.722
but we'll make it work.
MARISHA: Yeah, we're--

01:08:22.723 --> 01:08:24.588
This is the spinoff, okay?

01:08:24.589 --> 01:08:25.422
SAM: Yeah.

01:08:25.423 --> 01:08:27.758
Yeah, it's like my partner died at the end of season two

01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:30.028
or something and you're the new partner.

01:08:30.029 --> 01:08:31.423
MARISHA: Why death?

01:08:31.424 --> 01:08:32.257
Why did you have to go there?

01:08:32.258 --> 01:08:34.422
Just-- she's still alive.
SAM: It's dramatic.

01:08:34.423 --> 01:08:35.256
It's a dramatic-- seems like

01:08:35.257 --> 01:08:38.089
a good season ender, I don't know.
LAURA: Because it's foreshadowing, Beau.

01:08:40.579 --> 01:08:41.412
SAM: Anyway.

01:08:41.413 --> 01:08:43.281
(laughter)

01:08:43.282 --> 01:08:44.698
Let's go inspect the bodies.

01:08:44.699 --> 01:08:45.988
I'm going to go look at the body

01:08:45.989 --> 01:08:49.220
for signs of what killed it.

01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:51.558
Was it magic, was it swords, was it--

01:08:51.559 --> 01:08:52.708
MATT: Okay.

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:54.398
Make a medicine check for me, please.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:55.711
SAM: Oh boy, medicine.

01:08:55.712 --> 01:08:57.603
MARISHA: And can I see--

01:08:57.604 --> 01:08:58.437
SAM: Four.

01:08:59.449 --> 01:09:01.002
MATT: All right, you have--

01:09:02.249 --> 01:09:03.995
SAM: A lot of blood.

01:09:03.996 --> 01:09:06.270
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: You can't pick out the specifics

01:09:06.271 --> 01:09:07.938
of what killed these creatures,

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:09.488
but you get the sense there are a lot

01:09:09.489 --> 01:09:12.038
of heavy slash marks across them.

01:09:12.039 --> 01:09:12.972
SAM: Sure.

01:09:12.973 --> 01:09:16.398
MATT: There are shredded ribbons of these creatures.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:19.658
You can see flesh is filleted in places and thrown.

01:09:19.659 --> 01:09:20.928
And these heavy gash marks,

01:09:20.929 --> 01:09:24.078
these sweeping blade slices

01:09:24.079 --> 01:09:26.778
up and across the torso and limbs.

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:28.448
Getting a closer look at these creatures,

01:09:28.449 --> 01:09:32.048
they are built like the

01:09:32.049 --> 01:09:34.068
most muscular gorilla

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.688
you've ever seen.

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:39.358
And standing would probably be close to nine feet tall,

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:43.018
nearly ogreish in physicality.

01:09:43.019 --> 01:09:48.019
Except their faces are like a bear

01:09:48.579 --> 01:09:52.194
or a thicker dog-type head.

01:09:52.195 --> 01:09:53.028
MARISHA: Wow.

01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:56.028
MATT: The eyes are these pale yellow coloration.

01:09:56.029 --> 01:09:59.586
And the body is covered in this very fine,

01:09:59.587 --> 01:10:02.173
deep greenish splotchy fur.

01:10:02.174 --> 01:10:03.057
SAM: Ooh.

01:10:03.058 --> 01:10:05.718
MATT: The teeth and the fangs are long and pointed.

01:10:05.719 --> 01:10:09.362
And the fingers end in these heavy bladed claws.

01:10:10.569 --> 01:10:12.998
SAM: Dude, that's sick.

01:10:12.999 --> 01:10:14.498
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:10:14.499 --> 01:10:18.003
MATT: You've never seen creatures like this before.

01:10:18.004 --> 01:10:21.028
Thankfully, these two are dead.

01:10:21.029 --> 01:10:22.919
SAM: These two, there could be more.

01:10:24.259 --> 01:10:28.095
Or their cries for help could have alerted their, you know--

01:10:28.096 --> 01:10:28.929
MARISHA: Mates.

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.349
SAM: Well yeah, or their pod or whatever--

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.544
MARISHA: Their children.

01:10:31.545 --> 01:10:32.378
SAM: Children.

01:10:32.379 --> 01:10:33.698
TRAVIS: It's all couples down here.

01:10:33.699 --> 01:10:36.252
MARISHA: Yeah, just long lost couples.

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.998
Can I ascertain--
LAURA: Aeor is for lovers.

01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:42.332
MARISHA: -- which direction-- yes.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:44.548
Take your honeymoon

01:10:44.549 --> 01:10:45.938
in Aeor.
TRAVIS: This all-inclusive package

01:10:45.939 --> 01:10:47.122
was bullshit!

01:10:48.499 --> 01:10:51.636
SAM: There's a kid's club somewhere for monster kids?

01:10:51.637 --> 01:10:52.606
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:10:52.607 --> 01:10:54.689
(laughter)

01:10:55.592 --> 01:10:58.718
MARISHA: Can I see which direction, more blood trail

01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:02.547
or any tracking of blood in any direction?

01:11:02.548 --> 01:11:04.298
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

01:11:04.299 --> 01:11:06.566
MARISHA: Yeah, investigation!
MATT: Or survival.

01:11:06.567 --> 01:11:08.303
MARISHA: Or survival, investigation!

01:11:08.304 --> 01:11:10.218
LIAM: You also know that Caleb got a whiff of necromancy

01:11:10.219 --> 01:11:12.078
from this location.

01:11:12.079 --> 01:11:13.512
MARISHA: Okay.

01:11:13.513 --> 01:11:15.118
Okay, 21.

01:11:15.119 --> 01:11:15.952
MATT: 21.

01:11:16.869 --> 01:11:20.278
You can see there is a bit of a trail.

01:11:20.279 --> 01:11:24.308
It looks like blood mostly from these creatures

01:11:24.309 --> 01:11:29.078
that continues on for about 10, 15 or so feet

01:11:29.079 --> 01:11:30.188
following this road.

01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:31.668
And this road is like a major road

01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:33.398
where you can see it probably would have connected

01:11:33.399 --> 01:11:35.178
with any of the other wards of the city.

01:11:35.179 --> 01:11:37.408
Or it's one of the more central thoroughfare portions

01:11:37.409 --> 01:11:39.438
of the city's ward.

01:11:39.439 --> 01:11:43.158
Before it is met with this heavy stone

01:11:43.159 --> 01:11:45.868
that seems to have bisected the region.

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:49.288
SAM: So the road keeps going past this?

01:11:49.289 --> 01:11:51.268
MATT: Well, the road would continue past

01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:53.978
if during the impact of the city,

01:11:53.979 --> 01:11:58.378
a large portion of this cavern didn't collapse into it

01:11:58.379 --> 01:11:59.745
and jammed--
MARISHA: Cut it off?

01:11:59.746 --> 01:12:01.956
Can I see, does it look like it drops off?

01:12:03.081 --> 01:12:05.128
Are there paths carved around this?

01:12:05.129 --> 01:12:06.628
MATT: You can keep going and looking if you want.

01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:07.462
MARISHA: Do you want a peek

01:12:07.462 --> 01:12:08.295
or should we go back?
MARISHA: You do hear

01:12:08.296 --> 01:12:11.318
at this moment though with your passive perception

01:12:11.319 --> 01:12:12.458
some movement.

01:12:12.459 --> 01:12:13.292
MARISHA: Oh.

01:12:14.249 --> 01:12:15.180
SAM: We could go back and tell the others.

01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:18.546
MATT: Not quite sure the direction,
but you did hear something.

01:12:18.547 --> 01:12:19.698
MARISHA: Not quite sure the direction.

01:12:19.699 --> 01:12:21.233
Does it sound big? Does it sound--

01:12:21.234 --> 01:12:22.958
MATT: Make a perception check intentionally

01:12:22.959 --> 01:12:24.588
if you want to try and listen for a path

01:12:24.589 --> 01:12:27.218
or some semblance of information about the sound.

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:29.132
MARISHA: Ooh, yucky. 13.

01:12:30.329 --> 01:12:31.162
MATT: Okay.

01:12:31.163 --> 01:12:32.548
You're pretty sure you heard something.

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.055
MARISHA: Did you hear that?

01:12:34.056 --> 01:12:34.949
SAM: No?

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:38.888
MARISHA: (uncertain stammering) I think we should go back.

01:12:38.889 --> 01:12:39.722
SAM: Okay.

01:12:40.619 --> 01:12:41.452
MARISHA: Okay.

01:12:41.453 --> 01:12:42.927
SAM: Okay.
MATT: Your orb is still glowing.

01:12:45.679 --> 01:12:47.298
SAM: Should I turn it off?

01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:49.493
Caleb didn't tell me how to turn it off.

01:12:49.494 --> 01:12:50.968
I'll just say the same thing again.

01:12:50.969 --> 01:12:52.285
<i>Tawhaj!</i>
MATT: (light extinguishing)

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:53.658
SAM: Oh hey!

01:12:53.659 --> 01:12:54.492
Ah! Where'd you go!?

01:12:54.493 --> 01:12:56.589
MARISHA: (whispering) Wait, right here,
right here, right here, okay.

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:58.204
MATT: You hear a little bit more movement.

01:12:58.205 --> 01:12:59.038
MARISHA: Hold my hand.

01:12:59.039 --> 01:13:01.058
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:13:01.059 --> 01:13:02.286
SAM: Ah! I slipped on the blood.

01:13:02.287 --> 01:13:04.277
MARISHA: Oh god, I pick her up.

01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:05.150
LAURA: You're such a dick.

01:13:05.151 --> 01:13:07.218
MATT: I would like you both to make stealth checks, please.

01:13:07.219 --> 01:13:09.302
(laughter)

01:13:10.379 --> 01:13:11.527
MARISHA: Oh!
SAM: 29.

01:13:11.528 --> 01:13:12.757
MARISHA: 29?!

01:13:12.758 --> 01:13:13.699
I rolled a 19.

01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:14.532
MATT: All right.

01:13:14.533 --> 01:13:16.488
As you both skitter off the road

01:13:16.489 --> 01:13:18.788
and begin to carefully make your way back.

01:13:18.789 --> 01:13:22.930
Beauregard, you hear one sound in the distance,

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:24.989
back where you guys were.

01:13:26.347 --> 01:13:28.558
(growls)

01:13:28.559 --> 01:13:29.392
MARISHA: Did you hear that?

01:13:29.392 --> 01:13:30.259
SAM: That I heard.

01:13:30.259 --> 01:13:31.209
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:32.665
MATT: And that's it.

01:13:32.666 --> 01:13:36.818
MARISHA: Do you think that's gorilla-dog-man?

01:13:36.819 --> 01:13:40.586
SAM: Yeah, maybe it's their child.

01:13:40.587 --> 01:13:41.838
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, or lover.

01:13:41.839 --> 01:13:43.108
Maybe they were--

01:13:43.109 --> 01:13:44.768
SAM: Maybe they had like a polyamorous

01:13:44.769 --> 01:13:46.056
sort of a throuple.
MARISHA: Yes.

01:13:46.057 --> 01:13:46.890
SAM: They were a throuple!

01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:51.042
(gasps) They were a throuple and now one of them is just--

01:13:51.043 --> 01:13:52.137
MARISHA: Just by himself.

01:13:53.009 --> 01:13:54.458
SAM: Or herself or themself.

01:13:54.459 --> 01:13:56.008
MARISHA: Sure.
SAM: We don't know how it works.

01:13:56.009 --> 01:13:57.475
MARISHA: Man, that would suck.

01:13:57.476 --> 01:13:58.309
SAM: It would be.

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.328
MARISHA: I bet they're very sexually angsty you know.

01:14:01.329 --> 01:14:05.238
SAM: They're definitely very sexually explorative.

01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:06.072
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:06.073 --> 01:14:08.278
SAM: This is definitely a sexual creature.

01:14:08.279 --> 01:14:10.444
I get that sense.

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:13.034
It's sex positive creature.

01:14:13.035 --> 01:14:15.001
MARISHA: I think so. I kind of got that vibe.

01:14:15.002 --> 01:14:15.968
SAM: I got that vibe.

01:14:15.968 --> 01:14:16.801
MARISHA: Man.

01:14:16.801 --> 01:14:17.634
MATT: Roll--

01:14:17.635 --> 01:14:19.498
(laughter)

01:14:19.499 --> 01:14:21.358
LIAM: Have they been eaten yet?

01:14:21.359 --> 01:14:23.668
MATT: Roll a medicine check, Beauregard.

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:25.506
SAM: To see how sex positive they are?

01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:27.480
(laughter)

01:14:27.481 --> 01:14:29.448
MARISHA: Just felt a lot of body positivity.

01:14:29.449 --> 01:14:31.089
I dropped the die.

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:33.117
Mm, roll what?

01:14:33.118 --> 01:14:33.951
A medicine?
MATT: A medicine check.

01:14:33.951 --> 01:14:34.784
MARISHA: Okay.

01:14:36.199 --> 01:14:37.218
Wait.

01:14:37.219 --> 01:14:38.658
I never do this.

01:14:38.659 --> 01:14:40.829
Oh!
TRAVIS: No, you don't say.

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:41.688
You don't do this?

01:14:41.688 --> 01:14:42.521
MARISHA: 20 total.

01:14:42.522 --> 01:14:43.788
SAM: Hey, that's pretty good.

01:14:43.789 --> 01:14:44.988
MARISHA: I rolled really high.

01:14:44.989 --> 01:14:47.868
MATT: As Veth is saying this, you glanced over.

01:14:47.869 --> 01:14:48.702
But now that you think about it

01:14:48.703 --> 01:14:50.925
you don't think either of these creatures had sex organs.

01:14:50.926 --> 01:14:52.488
SAM: Oh.

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:54.238
MARISHA: Definitely sexually frustrated.

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:55.072
SAM: Oh, that's--

01:14:55.073 --> 01:14:56.418
MARISHA: They don't have sex organs.

01:14:56.419 --> 01:14:57.668
TRAVIS: Are absent.
SAM That's what it was.

01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:58.629
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:59.559
SAM: You solved it.

01:14:59.559 --> 01:15:00.392
MARISHA: Man.

01:15:00.392 --> 01:15:01.386
SAM: You're a good partner.

01:15:01.386 --> 01:15:02.369
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:03.527
I like the spinoff series.

01:15:03.528 --> 01:15:04.408
SAM: Yeah.

01:15:04.409 --> 01:15:06.073
MARISHA: Hobbs and Shaw.
SAM: I like how

01:15:06.074 --> 01:15:07.618
you're whispering and I'm not.

01:15:07.619 --> 01:15:09.348
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

01:15:09.349 --> 01:15:10.343
SAM: Let's go!

01:15:10.343 --> 01:15:11.176
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

01:15:11.177 --> 01:15:12.492
(laughter)

01:15:12.493 --> 01:15:14.438
MATT: Damn good thing you both rolled high stealth, man.

01:15:14.439 --> 01:15:16.413
TRAVIS: That one drunk friend at
the party that's whispering

01:15:16.414 --> 01:15:18.066
and you're like, "It's loud in here,

01:15:18.067 --> 01:15:20.348
"you can talk."
(laughter)

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.705
MARISHA: (whispering) I'm trying to tell you a secret.

01:15:21.706 --> 01:15:22.768
TRAVIS: (whispering) I had four.

01:15:22.769 --> 01:15:23.694
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:15:23.695 --> 01:15:25.939
(laughter)

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:29.201
MARISHA: Why are you whispering? (laughs)

01:15:29.202 --> 01:15:31.222
Can't hear you over Katy Perry.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:33.178
MATT: Beau and Veth have been gone

01:15:33.179 --> 01:15:35.738
for approximately 25 or so minutes.

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:36.778
LAURA: Jeez louise.

01:15:36.779 --> 01:15:39.198
MATT: Is there anything you would
begin to do in their absence?

01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:40.364
TRAVIS: I guess move on without them.

01:15:40.365 --> 01:15:42.318
(laughter)

01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:44.598
MATT: Well, it's a shame it had to end here.

01:15:44.599 --> 01:15:45.658
MARISHA: Well, this thing happened.

01:15:45.659 --> 01:15:48.442
LIAM: If Jester pesters me and we've got that robe

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.512
and that much time passes, I'll Identify it.

01:15:52.033 --> 01:15:53.410
TRAVIS: Yes, please.

01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:55.076
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: For sure.

01:15:55.077 --> 01:15:57.073
LIAM: I'll Identify it while on Yasha.
ASHLEY: Do I need to take it off?

01:15:57.074 --> 01:15:58.016
LIAM: No, not at all, just stand still.

01:15:58.017 --> 01:15:59.839
ASHLEY: I can keep it on while you do your magic?

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.122
LIAM: Yep, just keep those broad shoulders broad

01:16:02.123 --> 01:16:04.294
and I will-- Yep, people, please.

01:16:05.239 --> 01:16:07.210
Okay, just hold it like that for 10 minutes.

01:16:07.211 --> 01:16:08.258
SAM: Oh god.

01:16:08.259 --> 01:16:09.092
ASHLEY: Got it.

01:16:09.092 --> 01:16:09.979
I can do it easy.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.408
SAM: Maybe pulse, just pulse.

01:16:11.409 --> 01:16:12.941
LAURA: I'll do it with her.
ASHLEY: Circles?

01:16:12.942 --> 01:16:14.142
TRAVIS: Make it burn.

01:16:16.183 --> 01:16:18.273
LIAM: Okay, just do that for another minute.
MATT: I'm not doing the Tony Horton again.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:19.514
I already did it once, it's a damn pain.

01:16:19.515 --> 01:16:20.782
You get it once.

01:16:22.357 --> 01:16:27.357
It is a beautifully sundered Aeorian silk robe

01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:30.898
that, while not magical, she plays it off pretty well.

01:16:30.899 --> 01:16:33.008
LAURA: How did that thing last for so long

01:16:33.009 --> 01:16:34.888
if it's not magical at all?

01:16:34.889 --> 01:16:38.062
ASHLEY: I think you are wrong.

01:16:38.063 --> 01:16:40.628
LIAM: Well, look, if you look where you mended it,

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:44.967
it says 90% polyester, so that lasts forever.

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:46.450
LAURA: Makes sense.

01:16:46.451 --> 01:16:50.700
ASHLEY: Well, it's a beautiful material,

01:16:50.701 --> 01:16:52.024
even if it is polyester.

01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:54.568
LIAM: You can just kind of make out the group of horses

01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:56.328
on the front of it.

01:16:56.329 --> 01:16:57.259
It's beautiful.

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.289
ASHLEY: I like it a lot.

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:00.630
I'm going to wear it.

01:17:00.631 --> 01:17:03.435
MATT: Right about this time, Beau and Veth arrive.

01:17:03.436 --> 01:17:04.269
LAURA: Did you find anything?

01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:05.951
SAM: Yes!
ASHLEY: You're covered in blood!

01:17:05.952 --> 01:17:08.283
SAM: Yeah, well, that happens every time I go anywhere.

01:17:08.284 --> 01:17:10.493
MARISHA: I just had to beat the shit out of her.

01:17:10.494 --> 01:17:12.758
I just got to the edge, just couldn't take it anymore.

01:17:12.759 --> 01:17:13.918
TRAVIS: How did it feel?

01:17:13.919 --> 01:17:14.752
MARISHA: It felt great.

01:17:14.753 --> 01:17:16.938
ASHLEY: Lucky!
(laughter)

01:17:16.939 --> 01:17:18.587
MARISHA: 30 years of build up.

01:17:18.588 --> 01:17:19.421
SAM: I deserved it,
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:17:19.422 --> 01:17:20.482
SAM: I deserved it.

01:17:20.483 --> 01:17:21.366
LIAM: I just leveled up.

01:17:21.367 --> 01:17:23.718
SAM: I mouthed off a little bit too much.

01:17:23.719 --> 01:17:24.874
LAURA: What did you find?

01:17:24.875 --> 01:17:27.243
SAM: I'll keep my fucking mouth shut next time.

01:17:28.196 --> 01:17:29.029
LAURA: What did you find?

01:17:29.029 --> 01:17:29.862
SAM: We found--

01:17:29.863 --> 01:17:32.294
(laughter)

01:17:32.295 --> 01:17:37.245
We found two bodies of huge monster sex creatures.

01:17:38.251 --> 01:17:40.868
And they were dead because the Tomb Takers,

01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:45.869
specifically we think Cree, eviscerated
them with her blades.

01:17:46.109 --> 01:17:49.172
LAURA: I thought Cree used magic and Lucien used blades.

01:17:49.173 --> 01:17:50.006
MARISHA: Yeah, Lucien has blades.

01:17:50.007 --> 01:17:51.408
SAM: I only focused on Otis.

01:17:51.409 --> 01:17:53.679
I don't know what any of the other ones do.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.770
(laughter)

01:17:56.771 --> 01:18:00.109
TRAVIS: You've literally fought with Molly.

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:02.238
(laughter)

01:18:02.239 --> 01:18:05.138
MARISHA: She totally came to this conclusion on her own.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:05.972
I did not--

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:08.095
(laughter)

01:18:08.096 --> 01:18:09.030
SAM: I don't know.

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.899
I don't know what the other ones do.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:13.549
TRAVIS: Scimitars. Lucien has scimitars.

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:16.988
SAM: Lucien does magic and eyes, right? He doesn't need--

01:18:18.267 --> 01:18:20.976
MARISHA: I've never seen Cree use a blade.

01:18:20.977 --> 01:18:22.787
SAM: I thought because she has blood--

01:18:22.788 --> 01:18:26.557
LIAM: We have a foot tall toy with swords.

01:18:26.558 --> 01:18:28.094
TRAVIS: She has a sigil.

01:18:28.095 --> 01:18:29.728
SAM: He's magic now. He doesn't need the swords.

01:18:29.729 --> 01:18:30.562
He has the eyes.

01:18:30.563 --> 01:18:32.345
LAURA: He uses the swords.
TRAVIS: Magic, yeah.

01:18:32.346 --> 01:18:33.179
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.458
Remember when they kicked our asses out in the snow?

01:18:35.459 --> 01:18:36.728
The swords were there.

01:18:36.729 --> 01:18:38.448
SAM: I can't see a lot, guys.

01:18:38.449 --> 01:18:40.721
(laughter)

01:18:40.722 --> 01:18:43.258
Oi! It could have been Lucien, it could have been Lucien.

01:18:43.259 --> 01:18:44.209
I'm on the fence.

01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:45.042
Maybe it was both.

01:18:45.043 --> 01:18:46.408
MARISHA: It was definitely one of the Tomb Takers.

01:18:46.409 --> 01:18:47.758
It was a fresh kill.

01:18:47.759 --> 01:18:49.605
There was two of them, lots of blood.

01:18:49.606 --> 01:18:50.439
LIAM: Wait a moment.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.528
LAURA: Tomb Taker blood?

01:18:51.529 --> 01:18:54.058
MARISHA: Yeah, we saw red blood and purple-y black blood.

01:18:54.059 --> 01:18:55.877
LIAM: What does she mean by sex monsters?

01:18:55.878 --> 01:18:57.888
ASHLEY: I was just going to ask. I don't know what that is.

01:18:57.889 --> 01:18:59.665
SAM: Well--
MARISHA: We're just--

01:18:59.666 --> 01:19:02.048
Yeah, we got this vibe.

01:19:02.049 --> 01:19:04.018
You know we just got this--

01:19:04.019 --> 01:19:06.528
LIAM: Of supercharged sex monsters?

01:19:06.529 --> 01:19:07.362
MARISHA: Yes!

01:19:07.363 --> 01:19:10.305
LAURA: Were they having sex-- the bodies?

01:19:10.306 --> 01:19:12.597
TRAVIS: Don't we need to be stopping the end of the world?

01:19:12.598 --> 01:19:15.998
SAM: We do! We're leaving out
one vital piece of information.

01:19:15.999 --> 01:19:18.496
Even more vital than the sex part.

01:19:18.497 --> 01:19:19.330
LAURA: What?

01:19:19.331 --> 01:19:22.644
SAM: There was a third monster that was still alive.

01:19:22.645 --> 01:19:24.398
LIAM: Third sex monster?
TRAVIS: And you killed it?

01:19:24.399 --> 01:19:25.928
SAM: We did not, we ran.

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:27.138
MARISHA: We heard it.

01:19:27.139 --> 01:19:27.972
TALIESIN: Perception check.
LAURA: What did it sound like?

01:19:27.973 --> 01:19:29.841
TALIESIN: Is there a monster coming for us?
MARISHA: It sounded like--

01:19:29.842 --> 01:19:31.878
MATT: Yeah, make a insight check.
MARISHA: (monster noises)

01:19:31.879 --> 01:19:32.809
MATT: Oh, you're looking for one.

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:33.749
TALIESIN: I'm looking for one.

01:19:33.749 --> 01:19:34.609
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:19:34.609 --> 01:19:35.519
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.601
MARISHA: I didn't do a--

01:19:36.602 --> 01:19:38.267
SAM: Yeah, it was--
TALIESIN: 26.

01:19:38.268 --> 01:19:39.588
SAM: It was like an ululation.

01:19:39.589 --> 01:19:42.807
MATT: With disadvantage because you cannot see in the dark.

01:19:42.808 --> 01:19:45.029
LIAM: (sings the Trololo song)
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.938
TALIESIN: 17.

01:19:45.938 --> 01:19:46.804
MATT: 17.

01:19:46.805 --> 01:19:48.864
You don't see anything at the moment.

01:19:48.865 --> 01:19:49.698
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:19:52.695 --> 01:19:54.948
LAURA: So we should head after them?

01:19:54.949 --> 01:19:57.718
TALIESIN: Or plan B.

01:19:57.719 --> 01:19:59.648
LAURA: Or amphitheater.

01:19:59.649 --> 01:20:01.608
SAM: Did you guys go into the amphitheater?

01:20:01.609 --> 01:20:02.442
LAURA: No.

01:20:02.443 --> 01:20:04.667
ASHLEY: We were all waiting for you guys.
LAURA: We could've done that.

01:20:04.668 --> 01:20:06.495
It would've taken a really long time.
SAM: So we're not going in there?

01:20:06.496 --> 01:20:07.726
We're skipping that?

01:20:07.727 --> 01:20:08.968
LAURA: I don't know!

01:20:08.969 --> 01:20:09.945
SAM: Okay, that's fine.

01:20:09.946 --> 01:20:12.475
TALIESIN: I think it's worth looking at.

01:20:12.476 --> 01:20:14.138
ASHLEY: The tower?

01:20:14.139 --> 01:20:15.005
TALIESIN: I mean, at this point--

01:20:15.005 --> 01:20:15.922
LAURA: No, the amphitheater.

01:20:15.923 --> 01:20:17.668
TALIESIN: We hoped we'd catch up at this point.

01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:19.860
LIAM: Yeah. We don't think they're in here.

01:20:19.861 --> 01:20:23.068
There's a good chance they slaughtered sex monsters that way

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:24.518
and kept going.

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.588
But we want to look into your idea.

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:28.168
TALIESIN: It couldn't hurt to ask.

01:20:28.169 --> 01:20:29.868
LIAM: An hour, we take an hour to do that.

01:20:29.869 --> 01:20:32.217
I don't think that tips the balance.

01:20:32.218 --> 01:20:33.958
And we're going to need to collapse at some time

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:34.792
and rest.

01:20:34.792 --> 01:20:35.669
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:37.348
SAM: But we know where the Tomb Takers went.

01:20:37.349 --> 01:20:41.298
They tracked through these erotic orgies

01:20:41.299 --> 01:20:43.188
and they kept going straight forward.

01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:46.046
LIAM: Into some sort of Eyes Wide Shut situation

01:20:46.047 --> 01:20:47.248
further that way.
SAM: Definitely some tantric.

01:20:47.249 --> 01:20:50.314
ASHLEY: Nine Eyes Wide Shut.
MARISHA: You could just feel the tension, you know.

01:20:50.315 --> 01:20:53.915
Nine Eyes Wide Shut, that's good!

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:54.749
That's great.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:57.362
LIAM: All of Beau and Caleb's eyes open simultaneously.

01:20:59.241 --> 01:21:00.708
LAURA: So we're going back to the amphitheater?

01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:02.041
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: Okay.

01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:04.115
SAM: To the amphitheater? That
wasn't one of the two choices.

01:21:04.116 --> 01:21:05.579
LAURA and LIAM: Yes, it was.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:06.945
SAM: We're going to the amphitheater?
LAURA: Yes.

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:07.978
SAM: So we're not going into tower?

01:21:07.979 --> 01:21:08.878
We're not going to chase

01:21:08.879 --> 01:21:10.578
the Tomb Takers. We're going to a third place?

01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:11.953
LAURA: We're going to the amphitheater that

01:21:11.954 --> 01:21:13.228
Caduceus talked about earlier.

01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:14.628
SAM: No, no, no, I recall.

01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:16.379
MARISHA: Also, Lucien has swords.

01:21:17.549 --> 01:21:19.891
LIAM: Pit stop at the theater.

01:21:19.892 --> 01:21:20.804
SAM: I'll take your word for it.

01:21:20.805 --> 01:21:24.904
(laughter)

01:21:26.602 --> 01:21:29.769
MATT: I would like everyone to
make a stealth check, please.

01:21:29.770 --> 01:21:30.854
LAURA: Blessing of the Trickster.

01:21:30.855 --> 01:21:31.833
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:21:31.834 --> 01:21:33.492
(laughter)

01:21:33.493 --> 01:21:34.809
TALIESIN: Oh!

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:37.474
SAM: 33.

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:38.680
LAURA: 25.

01:21:38.681 --> 01:21:39.840
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:21:39.841 --> 01:21:41.020
TRAVIS: 14.

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:41.854
ASHLEY: 21.

01:21:41.854 --> 01:21:42.721
TALIESIN: 21.
SAM: Dude.

01:21:42.722 --> 01:21:43.986
MARISHA: 24.
SAM: Dude!

01:21:43.987 --> 01:21:46.300
TALIESIN: Whoa!
MARISHA: That's good.

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:51.301
MATT: With expediency, and a sense of confidence

01:21:51.921 --> 01:21:55.160
you Mighty Nein trudge through the shadows and backward

01:21:55.161 --> 01:21:57.410
towards where you first began your journey

01:21:57.411 --> 01:21:58.614
into the Praesidis Ward.

01:21:59.491 --> 01:22:02.500
Until eventually, Caduceus leads you to the exterior

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:03.880
of the amphitheater.

01:22:03.881 --> 01:22:05.870
There are numerous entrances you can see.

01:22:05.871 --> 01:22:07.230
Large tunnel-like hallways

01:22:07.231 --> 01:22:12.231
that head towards the center of this presentory locale.

01:22:12.481 --> 01:22:14.500
And even just stepping close to where this entrance is

01:22:14.501 --> 01:22:16.600
you could see the dozens of bodies,

01:22:16.601 --> 01:22:19.760
individuals that appeared to have been running out

01:22:19.761 --> 01:22:23.370
from this amphitheater that fell dead to the ground.

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:27.922
Their bodies dried husks, the flesh withered, mummified,

01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:32.970
clothing untouched, just stepping over and around them

01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:35.930
as you make your way to the entrance tunnel

01:22:35.931 --> 01:22:37.414
to the amphitheater itself.

01:22:38.281 --> 01:22:39.840
LIAM: Is there any kind of verbiage

01:22:39.841 --> 01:22:42.540
or signs of any kind on the theater?

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:43.481
MATT: How long does that last again?

01:22:43.482 --> 01:22:45.146
LIAM: An hour.
MATT: An hour?

01:22:45.147 --> 01:22:48.518
Yes, this is-- let me look at this real fast.

01:22:49.978 --> 01:22:51.720
LIAM: The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.

01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:52.554
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

01:22:52.555 --> 01:22:54.116
SAM: Presents: A Charlie Brown Christmas.

01:22:54.117 --> 01:22:55.775
(laughter)

01:22:55.776 --> 01:22:59.526
TALIESIN: My god, everything makes sense now.
(laughter)

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:02.875
MARISHA: It is fair use.

01:23:02.876 --> 01:23:05.341
(laughter)

01:23:05.342 --> 01:23:07.212
MATT: Best Little Harvest Close Pageant Ever.

01:23:07.213 --> 01:23:08.890
(laughter)

01:23:08.891 --> 01:23:10.268
TALIESIN: Oh, The Nutcracker.

01:23:13.479 --> 01:23:16.530
MATT: Praesidis Discussion.

01:23:16.531 --> 01:23:18.643
Amph-- What's the word, fucking--

01:23:18.644 --> 01:23:20.310
MARISHA: Oh, right.

01:23:20.311 --> 01:23:21.261
MATT: Not amphitheater.

01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:23.898
MARISHA: No, we got this.
TALIESIN: Colosseum?

01:23:23.899 --> 01:23:24.857
MATT: Colosseum.

01:23:24.858 --> 01:23:25.880
MARISHA: You said something before that.

01:23:25.881 --> 01:23:27.170
LIAM: Discussion, you said?

01:23:27.171 --> 01:23:29.585
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Praesidis?

01:23:29.586 --> 01:23:30.691
SAM: It's the ward.

01:23:30.692 --> 01:23:31.525
LAURA: Oh.

01:23:34.114 --> 01:23:36.630
MATT: Looking at the various bits of writing on the walls

01:23:36.631 --> 01:23:38.310
around, you quickly get the sense

01:23:38.311 --> 01:23:43.311
that this was a center for political discourse.

01:23:43.468 --> 01:23:44.415
LIAM: TED Talks.

01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:47.247
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:23:47.248 --> 01:23:49.080
SAM: Like a salon?

01:23:49.081 --> 01:23:50.130
MATT: Sure.

01:23:50.131 --> 01:23:51.560
SAM: Intellectual salon?

01:23:51.561 --> 01:23:52.706
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:23:53.968 --> 01:23:54.851
TALIESIN: TED Talks.

01:23:54.852 --> 01:23:57.610
MATT: Stepping through, eventually
you come into the open space

01:23:57.611 --> 01:24:01.650
where you can see there are
the dull green bits of light,

01:24:01.651 --> 01:24:03.000
the glowing light sources

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:04.420
that are scattered throughout the ward

01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:07.060
and had been guiding you from element to element

01:24:07.061 --> 01:24:09.490
as you've traversed through the space.

01:24:09.491 --> 01:24:11.790
And that bright central blue light

01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:15.360
emanating from the dome that sits upon the central dais

01:24:15.361 --> 01:24:18.410
in the center of the open amphitheater.

01:24:18.411 --> 01:24:19.520
You can just vaguely make out

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.560
a darker shape in the middle of it.

01:24:21.561 --> 01:24:23.560
LAURA: Do you want to talk to one of the people here?

01:24:23.561 --> 01:24:26.270
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was like a priestess

01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:28.117
inside, if I recall?

01:24:28.118 --> 01:24:33.040
MATT: It looked like some sort of well-dressed, importantly

01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:34.988
decorated individual, who was--

01:24:34.989 --> 01:24:37.820
TALIESIN: Yeah, was trying to remember how much-- yeah.

01:24:37.821 --> 01:24:39.710
TRAVIS: As we step into that amphitheater,

01:24:39.711 --> 01:24:41.650
I'll do a second Divine Sense.

01:24:41.651 --> 01:24:44.694
Same thing just because the first one got a hit.

01:24:44.695 --> 01:24:46.295
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

01:24:48.081 --> 01:24:48.914
MATT: Nothing.

01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:52.024
TRAVIS: Seems clear.

01:24:53.001 --> 01:24:55.780
TALIESIN: I'm going to check the first few rows

01:24:55.781 --> 01:24:57.440
for someone well-dressed

01:24:57.441 --> 01:25:00.280
and with a head that seems relatively intact.

01:25:00.281 --> 01:25:02.500
LAURA: Somebody that can see the dome that was--

01:25:02.501 --> 01:25:04.480
TALIESIN: Somebody with a good view.

01:25:04.481 --> 01:25:05.314
MATT: Okay.

01:25:07.221 --> 01:25:09.570
Looking through for just a few moments,

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:14.111
you come to near the base of the dais

01:25:15.161 --> 01:25:16.791
propped up against that

01:25:18.471 --> 01:25:22.630
or right next to that strange metallic humanoid

01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:24.310
that you'd come across before.

01:25:24.311 --> 01:25:25.890
A sight which you figured out all the rest of you had seen,

01:25:25.891 --> 01:25:29.848
this is the second of these

01:25:29.849 --> 01:25:31.880
metal armored humanoids

01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:32.714
that you've come across.

01:25:32.715 --> 01:25:34.210
There was the first one that was heavily damaged

01:25:34.211 --> 01:25:35.250
in the chamber you were resting.

01:25:35.251 --> 01:25:37.480
This one looks to be mostly intact,

01:25:37.481 --> 01:25:41.090
though it looks like the legs are somewhat damaged,

01:25:41.091 --> 01:25:46.091
and the chest plate is partially open to the side.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:50.131
But beyond that, they look like they're mostly intact,

01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:55.160
though still with all the rest of the corpses around.

01:25:55.161 --> 01:25:59.543
The body next to it, you see, is a similarly dressed,

01:25:59.544 --> 01:26:01.690
but not well as decorated individual

01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:04.024
as the one inside the dome.

01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:09.000
Looks like they had one arm

01:26:09.001 --> 01:26:12.107
up on the dais and were in the process of going for a run

01:26:12.108 --> 01:26:14.964
and then just collapsed right into that spot.

01:26:18.251 --> 01:26:21.200
TALIESIN: All right.
LIAM: Before you do, Caduceus,

01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:22.258
come here for a moment.

01:26:22.259 --> 01:26:25.040
I'll pull out this little stone sculpture of a ziggurat

01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:28.490
I have with little letters and glyphs all around it,

01:26:28.491 --> 01:26:32.627
and I'm going to cast Tongues on Caduceus.

01:26:32.628 --> 01:26:33.461
TRAVIS: Smart.

01:26:33.462 --> 01:26:34.952
ASHLEY: That is so smart.

01:26:34.953 --> 01:26:38.045
MARISHA: So you can actually talk to him, good idea.

01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:46.940
TALIESIN: Trying to find my spells.

01:26:48.315 --> 01:26:49.148
Here we are.

01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:50.474
TRAVIS: -- too much to have a headache.

01:26:50.475 --> 01:26:53.681
LAURA: (laughs) I'm sad that cake--

01:26:53.682 --> 01:26:56.280
TALIESIN: (blows raspberries) All right, whoa, that's crazy.

01:26:56.281 --> 01:26:57.114
LIAM: It's a lie.

01:26:57.991 --> 01:27:01.940
TALIESIN: Let's wake this person up.

01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:04.780
MATT: Okay, as you kneel down and get close to the body

01:27:04.781 --> 01:27:07.640
and prop it back against the platform,

01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:10.055
the raised platform, the body itself,

01:27:10.056 --> 01:27:11.330
the dust clatters a bit.

01:27:11.331 --> 01:27:14.213
And you can hear the

01:27:14.214 --> 01:27:17.388
very fine, fragile, leather-like skin

01:27:17.389 --> 01:27:20.140
and bone hit the side of the stone

01:27:20.141 --> 01:27:22.197
and dust rests off of it.

01:27:22.198 --> 01:27:26.760
The long, stringy, dull white gray strands

01:27:26.761 --> 01:27:28.950
of doll-like hair that falls past the shoulders,

01:27:28.951 --> 01:27:32.930
clumps fall free from the mummified scalp.

01:27:32.931 --> 01:27:34.230
And you get now at this glance,

01:27:34.231 --> 01:27:38.810
this was likely a half-elf individual.

01:27:38.811 --> 01:27:41.990
Though the eyes are gone,

01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:44.990
the face itself is heavily sunken

01:27:44.991 --> 01:27:46.790
and you could see the teeth are exposed

01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:49.270
with the lips have curled back tightly.

01:27:49.271 --> 01:27:51.630
It is a terrifying sight to look into

01:27:51.631 --> 01:27:53.330
for anybody who isn't familiar

01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:56.410
with the process of interring corpses of any stage of decay.

01:27:56.411 --> 01:27:58.674
This is not a bother for you.

01:28:05.821 --> 01:28:07.971
TALIESIN: Tell me what brought you to the colosseum.

01:28:10.441 --> 01:28:12.160
MATT: You all watch for a moment.

01:28:12.161 --> 01:28:15.734
And as Caduceus asks the question,

01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:22.870
there is a a brief bit of

01:28:22.871 --> 01:28:27.871
faint greenish light that seems to apparate like a seed

01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:30.580
in the middle of the air, somewhat translucent.

01:28:30.581 --> 01:28:32.330
LAURA: Does it look like the little floating lights

01:28:32.331 --> 01:28:34.210
everywhere around the city?

01:28:34.211 --> 01:28:35.044
MATT: Not quite.
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:35.045 --> 01:28:38.420
MATT: This one is comforting,

01:28:38.421 --> 01:28:40.680
if only because it matches in some ways

01:28:40.681 --> 01:28:45.290
the ways that Fjord and sometimes Caduceus

01:28:45.291 --> 01:28:47.817
channel the power of the Wild Mother.

01:28:47.818 --> 01:28:48.651
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:48.652 --> 01:28:52.190
MATT: But as he begins to speak, this seed plants itself

01:28:52.191 --> 01:28:55.200
in the throat of this creature.

01:28:55.201 --> 01:28:57.530
Kind of fading into the skin.

01:28:57.531 --> 01:29:01.520
And as it does, the head (gasps)

01:29:01.521 --> 01:29:05.810
begins to inhale, it leans forward and looks towards you.

01:29:05.811 --> 01:29:09.980
The black, vacuous sockets peering back into Caduceus.

01:29:09.981 --> 01:29:14.164
"(gasping) We were here

01:29:14.165 --> 01:29:18.206
"to beseech Brashaar,

01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:21.586
"to protect us."

01:29:21.587 --> 01:29:22.420
TRAVIS: Brashaar?

01:29:22.421 --> 01:29:26.544
MATT: The rest of you hear (guttural foreign language).

01:29:26.545 --> 01:29:30.644
TALIESIN: We were here to beseech Brashaar to protect us.

01:29:32.111 --> 01:29:34.704
I'm going to mimic what he says as he says it.

01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:41.504
TALIESIN: Tell me about the person on stage.

01:29:43.733 --> 01:29:45.291
MATT: "Brashaar,

01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:51.490
"one of the great mages, architect,

01:29:53.148 --> 01:29:57.247
"and the one of many who put us to this doom."

01:29:57.248 --> 01:30:01.173
"and the one of many who put us to this doom."

01:30:07.619 --> 01:30:09.702
TALIESIN: What did she do to you?

01:30:11.881 --> 01:30:14.961
MATT: "Filled our minds with thoughts

01:30:18.851 --> 01:30:22.944
"drew the ire of the gods."

01:30:33.804 --> 01:30:35.525
TALIESIN: What are the Eyes of Nine?

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:43.791
MATT: "I have no knowledge of what you speak."

01:30:49.858 --> 01:30:51.775
TALIESIN: We need to undo this.

01:30:55.071 --> 01:30:58.550
Where in the city could I find those who opposed this,

01:30:58.551 --> 01:31:00.011
who tried to stop it?

01:31:02.053 --> 01:31:05.494
MATT: "Look around you."

01:31:08.451 --> 01:31:10.380
With that you watch as the face,

01:31:10.381 --> 01:31:15.123
begins turns to dust and caved in (cracking).

01:31:15.124 --> 01:31:18.351
SAM: Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?

01:31:18.352 --> 01:31:19.920
(laughter)

01:31:19.921 --> 01:31:22.067
TALIESIN: All right, well, clearly waking this person up

01:31:22.068 --> 01:31:25.788
would be a bad idea, but now we know.

01:31:25.789 --> 01:31:27.003
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Well,

01:31:27.004 --> 01:31:29.503
it didn't necessarily mean that.

01:31:29.504 --> 01:31:31.900
It just means that this is one of the great mages

01:31:31.901 --> 01:31:34.873
that thought they were better than the gods.

01:31:34.874 --> 01:31:35.707
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It seems like

01:31:35.708 --> 01:31:39.630
the gods delivered that blue dome, though.

01:31:39.631 --> 01:31:40.581
LAURA: Potentially.

01:31:40.582 --> 01:31:42.920
TALIESIN: I have a theory on the blue dome.

01:31:42.921 --> 01:31:44.290
LAURA: What?

01:31:44.291 --> 01:31:45.124
TALIESIN: I mean,

01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:51.760
if you were just trying to put yourself

01:31:51.761 --> 01:31:53.440
into some other space, maybe it's a way

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:55.024
of marking who's important,

01:31:57.221 --> 01:31:58.294
Like in a bad way.

01:32:00.364 --> 01:32:03.760
MARISHA: Like their psyche is somewhere--

01:32:03.761 --> 01:32:04.777
LAURA: Like Yussa?

01:32:05.681 --> 01:32:07.231
TALIESIN: I just see a lot of...

01:32:11.211 --> 01:32:12.970
You can look at where you leave a dead body

01:32:12.971 --> 01:32:15.940
and learn a lot about that person

01:32:15.941 --> 01:32:17.750
just by how they were treated.

01:32:17.751 --> 01:32:20.754
And these bodies were treated differently than the others.

01:32:23.521 --> 01:32:25.131
These bodies were protected

01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:28.824
and whatever happened here allowed that,

01:32:29.816 --> 01:32:32.113
I doubt it couldn't have stopped it.

01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:35.690
MATT: You can see Essek getting
a very close look at this dome.

01:32:35.691 --> 01:32:40.340
And occasionally running a hand across the exterior.

01:32:40.341 --> 01:32:45.150
And as he does, you can see all of these fractal patterns

01:32:45.151 --> 01:32:48.110
of arcane spirals that just appear.

01:32:48.111 --> 01:32:50.154
Like there's an extra layer of arcana

01:32:50.155 --> 01:32:53.520
to each of these domes that lays unseen

01:32:53.521 --> 01:32:56.350
until a practioned magic user knows

01:32:56.351 --> 01:32:58.430
how to pluck a bit and reveal it.

01:32:58.431 --> 01:33:00.281
And as he does, Essek turns and goes,

01:33:01.906 --> 01:33:04.400
"Whatever arcana is protecting these things

01:33:04.401 --> 01:33:06.920
"is beyond my understanding."

01:33:06.921 --> 01:33:08.870
LIAM: I'm going to join him at the dome,

01:33:08.871 --> 01:33:12.080
and I want to get a closer look at this person.

01:33:12.081 --> 01:33:15.480
So Caduceus, you told us everything that you heard

01:33:15.481 --> 01:33:17.200
and the Rashad was--

01:33:17.201 --> 01:33:18.900
LAURA: This person.
LIAM: The person in the bubble, yeah?

01:33:18.901 --> 01:33:19.734
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:33:19.735 --> 01:33:20.834
MATT: That's what it seemed.
TRAVIS: Brashaar.

01:33:20.835 --> 01:33:21.696
MARISHA: Bashard?

01:33:21.697 --> 01:33:22.725
MATT: Brashaar.
LAURA: Rashar.

01:33:22.726 --> 01:33:23.961
TRAVIS and LIAM: Brashaar.

01:33:23.962 --> 01:33:24.972
TRAVIS: With an R at the end?

01:33:24.973 --> 01:33:26.230
MATT: Mm-hmm, Brashaar.

01:33:26.231 --> 01:33:29.261
LIAM: I remember when you described him in the earlier game

01:33:29.262 --> 01:33:30.658
that they're like this.

01:33:30.659 --> 01:33:33.442
MATT: Yeah, arms up in a--

01:33:34.617 --> 01:33:38.324
like a proclamation or a--

01:33:38.325 --> 01:33:39.590
LIAM: Are they casting?

01:33:39.591 --> 01:33:41.400
MATT: It's hard to tell.

01:33:41.401 --> 01:33:42.960
If you would like to make a perception check

01:33:42.961 --> 01:33:46.907
to see if you could peer through the dense shifting

01:33:46.908 --> 01:33:49.790
of dome-like magical material to see if--

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:51.980
LIAM: Help me take a look at this, please.

01:33:51.981 --> 01:33:53.070
MATT: (as Essek) "Of course, of course."

01:33:53.071 --> 01:33:55.130
LAURA: You want me to Guide you, too?

01:33:55.131 --> 01:33:56.480
TALIESIN: Guide as well.

01:33:56.481 --> 01:33:58.910
MATT: Both you and Essek are going to go ahead

01:33:58.911 --> 01:34:00.640
and make perception checks.

01:34:00.641 --> 01:34:02.280
TALIESIN: With a d4.

01:34:02.281 --> 01:34:03.114
LIAM: I rolled balls.

01:34:03.115 --> 01:34:05.205
MATT: So did he.

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:06.426
With a d4?

01:34:06.427 --> 01:34:07.890
Mm-hmm, it helps.

01:34:07.891 --> 01:34:10.252
LIAM: Seven total. Rolled a three.

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:12.920
MATT: 13 For him.

01:34:12.921 --> 01:34:13.754
LIAM: Okay.

01:34:15.654 --> 01:34:17.830
MATT: You can make out primarily

01:34:17.831 --> 01:34:19.814
the same details that Caduceus did.

01:34:21.041 --> 01:34:23.133
If not as much as he did.

01:34:23.134 --> 01:34:26.410
You can see the pose, the positioning.

01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:29.111
At best, you can tell they were,

01:34:30.811 --> 01:34:32.450
amongst all the corpses that you've come across

01:34:32.451 --> 01:34:36.000
very well-dressed, a lot of jewelry.

01:34:36.001 --> 01:34:41.001
Looked to be of very high station visually.

01:34:41.371 --> 01:34:42.890
And the fact that they are

01:34:42.891 --> 01:34:44.100
in the middle of this amphitheater,

01:34:44.101 --> 01:34:47.710
given the context of what you've ascertained of its purpose,

01:34:47.711 --> 01:34:49.380
of what you learned from the corpse.

01:34:49.381 --> 01:34:51.540
This is probably, probably

01:34:51.541 --> 01:34:53.340
a very important political individual

01:34:53.341 --> 01:34:56.236
within the context of the mageocracy of Aeor.

01:34:59.231 --> 01:35:01.560
It's hard to tell if they're in the middle

01:35:01.561 --> 01:35:02.610
of an impassioned speech

01:35:02.611 --> 01:35:05.760
or the middle of a spell being cast.

01:35:05.761 --> 01:35:10.034
LIAM: Well so, I don't know, but my suspicion is,

01:35:10.911 --> 01:35:14.350
put yourself in her place at that time.

01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:17.844
The building is being thrown down from the sky.

01:35:19.911 --> 01:35:20.744
What is she doing?

01:35:20.745 --> 01:35:23.340
Is she giving an impassioned speech to the people

01:35:23.341 --> 01:35:24.450
telling them to be calm?

01:35:24.451 --> 01:35:25.994
Is she saving herself?

01:35:30.001 --> 01:35:34.564
MATT: "It is hard to say. From what I know,

01:35:35.761 --> 01:35:40.450
"at least from what information has been gathered.

01:35:40.451 --> 01:35:42.310
"It is said throughout history

01:35:42.311 --> 01:35:47.006
"that the Aeorian people were very,

01:35:51.961 --> 01:35:54.586
"what is the word in Common?

01:35:57.644 --> 01:35:59.349
"Self-focused."

01:36:01.751 --> 01:36:02.860
LIAM: Exactly.

01:36:02.861 --> 01:36:05.640
MATT: "So that is to the individual

01:36:05.641 --> 01:36:07.530
"or to the other people here,

01:36:07.531 --> 01:36:10.444
"if it was an attempt to save,

01:36:11.931 --> 01:36:14.140
"that was quite obviously a failure."

01:36:14.141 --> 01:36:16.801
As he glides around and gestures

01:36:16.802 --> 01:36:20.760
to the droves of long dead bodies around you.

01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:24.287
LIAM: I think so, too.

01:36:24.288 --> 01:36:28.080
I think she definitely wanted to save herself, maybe others,

01:36:28.081 --> 01:36:32.680
but I don't think these mages disturbed the gods

01:36:32.681 --> 01:36:35.936
to the point where they threw them out of the sky.

01:36:38.231 --> 01:36:40.231
TALIESIN: I think these mages created the city.

01:36:41.621 --> 01:36:42.585
LIAM: Yes.

01:36:42.586 --> 01:36:45.424
SAM: The other bubbles that we saw people frozen in,

01:36:46.281 --> 01:36:48.800
were they all mages casting things?

01:36:48.801 --> 01:36:50.310
LAURA: No, some of them were running.

01:36:50.311 --> 01:36:54.300
MATT: Some of them seemed to be standard people fleeing.

01:36:54.301 --> 01:36:56.310
And you found them at different parts

01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:57.994
of broken ruins across Eiselcross.

01:36:57.995 --> 01:36:59.229
SAM: It could just be random.

01:37:00.391 --> 01:37:02.740
LIAM: It could be. We didn't,

01:37:02.741 --> 01:37:04.200
unless I'm remembering incorrectly,

01:37:04.201 --> 01:37:06.694
didn't get a sense one way or the other.

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:10.720
We weren't even thinking about it really what it could be.

01:37:10.721 --> 01:37:13.770
So it could have been somebody in that crowd who did that,

01:37:13.771 --> 01:37:15.297
or it could be an outside force.

01:37:15.298 --> 01:37:17.340
We don't ultimately know,

01:37:17.341 --> 01:37:18.879
but my suspicion is that

01:37:20.681 --> 01:37:24.060
this was a last ditch effort to survive calamity.

01:37:24.061 --> 01:37:25.240
SAM: Can I scan around the crowd

01:37:25.241 --> 01:37:28.049
and just see if everyone

01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:32.065
is the same sort of body type,

01:37:32.066 --> 01:37:34.491
like everyone's Aeorian?

01:37:35.801 --> 01:37:37.270
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:37:37.271 --> 01:37:38.421
SAM: I'm not good at that.

01:37:39.371 --> 01:37:42.140
Ooh, 14. Okay.

01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:43.510
MATT: Okay.

01:37:43.511 --> 01:37:45.664
Glancing around, it's a--

01:37:48.131 --> 01:37:51.070
I wouldn't say it's Menagerie Coast

01:37:51.071 --> 01:37:55.361
or Xhorhasian in its

01:37:55.362 --> 01:37:57.186
ancestral diversity, necessarily.

01:37:57.187 --> 01:38:00.038
Primarily human, elf, and in-between,

01:38:03.761 --> 01:38:05.940
and that's the majority of it.

01:38:05.941 --> 01:38:09.360
You don't see, at least within the amphitheater

01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:11.711
or the corpses you've come, across any halflings.

01:38:12.901 --> 01:38:15.710
You don't seem to have come across any dwarves.

01:38:15.711 --> 01:38:16.891
It seems to be fairly

01:38:19.161 --> 01:38:22.554
culturally kept between a human and elven culture.

01:38:24.461 --> 01:38:27.200
At least this portion of the city that you've been through.

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.520
And even then, most of the corpses

01:38:28.521 --> 01:38:30.850
you haven't stopped to inspect thoroughly.

01:38:30.851 --> 01:38:32.340
A lot of dead bodies like that

01:38:32.341 --> 01:38:35.580
look the same if you're just walking by in shadow.

01:38:35.581 --> 01:38:37.440
But at least in the general presence around you

01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:39.800
with that roll, that's what you make out.

01:38:39.801 --> 01:38:41.232
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: And what was Essek doing?

01:38:41.233 --> 01:38:43.750
Was he doing some high level dispelling there?

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:44.801
MATT: You're not certain.

01:38:45.821 --> 01:38:49.590
This seemed to be his version of the Detect Magic,

01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:52.510
and trying to ascertain the nature

01:38:52.511 --> 01:38:54.050
of this particular spell,

01:38:54.051 --> 01:38:56.990
but it seemed far more complex

01:38:56.991 --> 01:39:00.164
than a simple Detect Magic could read.

01:39:04.481 --> 01:39:05.781
TALIESIN: The spheres aren't random.

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:09.080
LAURA: A little nervous here.

01:39:09.081 --> 01:39:10.350
We're letting them get farther

01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:12.540
and farther ahead of us right now.

01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:13.374
MARISHA: I agree.

01:39:14.331 --> 01:39:16.920
We're not going to unlock this thing, right?

01:39:16.921 --> 01:39:19.520
LIAM: But our next step is sleep, isn't it?

01:39:19.521 --> 01:39:21.371
Or are we going to continue to chase?

01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:23.910
MARISHA: We've got to sleep at some point.

01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:26.530
TRAVIS: Well, we do, but I think we to know.

01:39:26.531 --> 01:39:28.040
We still don't know where they went,

01:39:28.041 --> 01:39:30.030
just which road they went down.

01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:31.370
SAM: Also, no matter what--

01:39:31.371 --> 01:39:32.371
Well, not no matter what,

01:39:32.372 --> 01:39:36.180
but if we don't stealth very well in chasing them,

01:39:36.181 --> 01:39:38.440
we're going to have to fight our way through

01:39:38.441 --> 01:39:40.524
you know an orgy monster.
MARISHA: Gorilla-dog-troll.

01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:47.506
SAM: Which I feel like we'll be okay with. I mean,

01:39:49.614 --> 01:39:53.050
if Cree by herself killed two of them,

01:39:53.051 --> 01:39:55.640
then probably we can dispatch one

01:39:55.641 --> 01:39:57.870
without too much effort.

01:39:57.871 --> 01:39:58.704
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:40:01.191 --> 01:40:02.330
Okay, well.

01:40:02.331 --> 01:40:04.684
SAM: So should we do that first before we sleep?

01:40:09.161 --> 01:40:11.844
LAURA: It's hard because I know I need sleep, but--

01:40:13.282 --> 01:40:14.458
SAM: You look fine.

01:40:14.459 --> 01:40:16.590
LAURA: (laughs) Thanks, I feel tired.

01:40:16.591 --> 01:40:19.494
But I just feel like, you know--

01:40:20.461 --> 01:40:21.880
SAM: You want to keep going?

01:40:21.881 --> 01:40:23.796
LAURA: Well, they could unleash a whole

01:40:23.797 --> 01:40:26.260
horrible demon city upon the entire world.

01:40:26.261 --> 01:40:30.240
So, it feels a little like--

01:40:30.241 --> 01:40:31.590
TALIESIN: It's always worth remembering, though,

01:40:31.591 --> 01:40:33.382
that they could do that, but at the moment,

01:40:33.383 --> 01:40:35.335
what could you do to stop it?

01:40:35.336 --> 01:40:36.490
LAURA: I don't know.

01:40:36.491 --> 01:40:38.000
TALIESIN: I know.

01:40:38.001 --> 01:40:40.050
MARISHA: And we know we have a day ahead of us, right?

01:40:40.051 --> 01:40:40.884
TALIESIN: At least.

01:40:41.881 --> 01:40:43.100
MARISHA: They're going to have to rest, too.

01:40:43.101 --> 01:40:44.280
Especially if they're continuing

01:40:44.281 --> 01:40:46.270
to clear the caverns for us.

01:40:46.271 --> 01:40:47.580
TRAVIS: They are?

01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:48.609
MARISHA: Why wouldn't they?

01:40:48.610 --> 01:40:50.493
TRAVIS: I thought they didn't sleep.
ASHLEY: He never sleeps.

01:40:50.494 --> 01:40:52.643
LAURA: Cree sleeps.
MARISHA: But they have to rest.

01:40:52.644 --> 01:40:55.240
LAURA: Cree sleeps, Lucien doesn't.

01:40:55.241 --> 01:40:56.910
MARISHA: Magic-- you know what I mean.

01:40:56.911 --> 01:40:58.200
Not that I'm a magic user,

01:40:58.201 --> 01:41:01.994
but even for someone like Cree, it's not a bottomless well.

01:41:04.681 --> 01:41:05.713
TRAVIS: It's not?

01:41:05.714 --> 01:41:08.539
I don't know, do we know for sure?

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.710
TALIESIN: We're pretty sure.
MARISHA: We watched them rest.

01:41:10.711 --> 01:41:12.500
LAURA: We watched them get injured.

01:41:12.501 --> 01:41:14.176
MARISHA: We watched them get injured.

01:41:17.395 --> 01:41:19.770
I think we can continue to follow.

01:41:22.341 --> 01:41:25.141
The path might tell us when they decide to rest as well.

01:41:26.931 --> 01:41:27.917
TALIESIN: If something happens right now

01:41:27.918 --> 01:41:31.920
we're going to be real down on our luck.

01:41:31.921 --> 01:41:33.510
LAURA: Then we sleep right here.

01:41:33.511 --> 01:41:34.411
Whatever we do,

01:41:34.412 --> 01:41:36.711
we need to make a decision and actually do it.

01:41:37.611 --> 01:41:40.146
LIAM: Well, that's the thing-- (sighs)

01:41:40.147 --> 01:41:41.517
SAM: How long have we been awake?

01:41:43.213 --> 01:41:45.190
LIAM: Long time. We did a short rest already.

01:41:45.191 --> 01:41:46.615
I used all my hit dice.

01:41:46.616 --> 01:41:48.710
LAURA: We tried to sleep.

01:41:48.711 --> 01:41:50.390
We didn't get a full rest.

01:41:50.391 --> 01:41:52.502
MARISHA: Matt, I'm assuming we have to start

01:41:52.503 --> 01:41:54.934
from scratch with that long rest.

01:41:56.041 --> 01:41:56.957
SAM: What do you-- what?

01:41:57.801 --> 01:41:59.000
TRAVIS: We were five and a half hours.

01:41:59.001 --> 01:42:01.630
MARISHA: Because we were, like, six hours in, so.

01:42:01.631 --> 01:42:03.050
MATT: You've traveled a bit in-between.

01:42:03.051 --> 01:42:04.120
I would be willing to say

01:42:04.121 --> 01:42:05.590
if you wanted to complete a long rest

01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:06.600
for the purposes of this,

01:42:06.601 --> 01:42:09.038
if you were to garnish an additional three,

01:42:09.039 --> 01:42:11.360
three and a half hours, you'd finish a long rest.

01:42:11.361 --> 01:42:14.219
LAURA: That's pretty cool.
TALIESIN: Oh, I will nap like a beast.

01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:16.170
SAM: But me and Caleb didn't sleep at all.

01:42:16.171 --> 01:42:17.450
LIAM: Right.
MATT: Correct, you guys

01:42:17.451 --> 01:42:18.284
would need a full.
LAURA: Neither did Fjord.

01:42:18.285 --> 01:42:21.452
Yeah. So the three of you would need a full night.

01:42:21.453 --> 01:42:23.917
LIAM: I don't want to run into that.

01:42:24.821 --> 01:42:26.486
TALIESIN: No.
LIAM: With where I'm at.

01:42:26.487 --> 01:42:30.500
SAM: And dead body said it would take a day, day and a half?

01:42:30.501 --> 01:42:32.780
TALIESIN: That's what they took last time, so.

01:42:32.781 --> 01:42:35.010
SAM: So they're going to rest at least once.

01:42:35.011 --> 01:42:35.981
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

01:42:35.981 --> 01:42:36.814
SAM: Maybe?

01:42:36.815 --> 01:42:39.290
TALIESIN: They know they're going to have to burn through.

01:42:39.291 --> 01:42:41.547
They don't have us clearing the path anymore.

01:42:41.548 --> 01:42:42.664
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:43.771 --> 01:42:45.570
They're also moving while we're standing still

01:42:45.571 --> 01:42:46.678
and talking about this, so--

01:42:46.679 --> 01:42:48.310
LIAM: I actually think we should,

01:42:48.311 --> 01:42:51.030
because I'm not spent, but I will be,

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:53.500
I think we should push forward now.

01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:54.770
Because there could be sex monsters

01:42:54.771 --> 01:42:55.604
that we're going to have to deal

01:42:55.605 --> 01:42:56.820
with tonight or tomorrow morning.

01:42:56.821 --> 01:42:59.540
So it's better that we deal with them

01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:00.950
on the dregs--
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:43:00.951 --> 01:43:02.430
LIAM: -- of where we're at.

01:43:02.431 --> 01:43:03.770
MARISHA: Then fight sex monsters,

01:43:03.771 --> 01:43:05.044
not first in the morning--

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:07.170
LAURA: Then let's go, let's go now.
TRAVIS: I'm in that boat as well.

01:43:07.171 --> 01:43:08.004
MARISHA: Okay.

01:43:08.005 --> 01:43:11.350
SAM: Before we leave, Matt, when you described the stage,

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:14.213
it was just the sorcerer on the stage?

01:43:14.214 --> 01:43:16.280
MATT: There was just the dome on the stage.

01:43:16.281 --> 01:43:20.340
And then there's the bodies around the base of it.

01:43:20.341 --> 01:43:22.000
There's that metallic body,

01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:23.680
it's leaning against the table with the damaged legs.

01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:25.500
There's the corpse that Caduceus

01:43:25.501 --> 01:43:27.840
looked in the eyes of and spoke to.

01:43:27.841 --> 01:43:30.920
And a number of other figures.

01:43:30.921 --> 01:43:35.270
SAM: The metallic one is, like, an armored thing?

01:43:35.271 --> 01:43:37.690
MATT: It looks similar to the one that you found

01:43:37.691 --> 01:43:40.170
in the first abode that you guys rested in,

01:43:40.171 --> 01:43:42.070
as well as a crushed creature

01:43:42.071 --> 01:43:43.690
that you found in one of the other ruins

01:43:43.691 --> 01:43:48.650
near where one of the threshold crests were found.

01:43:48.651 --> 01:43:49.810
It looks and appears to be human,

01:43:49.811 --> 01:43:51.830
though this one is even more intricately designed.

01:43:51.831 --> 01:43:54.042
You can see it's made of this

01:43:54.043 --> 01:43:56.170
dull, brass-like metal,

01:43:56.171 --> 01:43:58.033
with intricate filigree engraving across it.

01:43:58.034 --> 01:44:02.050
with intricate filigree engraving across it.

01:44:02.051 --> 01:44:06.660
It has no nose, but has a mouth and a jaw-type setup.

01:44:06.661 --> 01:44:11.090
These open sockets where eyes appear to be within

01:44:11.091 --> 01:44:15.704
though there's no white or coloration to the eye.

01:44:16.631 --> 01:44:19.650
Gold trim across it, it looks decorative almost.

01:44:19.651 --> 01:44:21.200
LAURA: Does it have the power gem on it

01:44:21.201 --> 01:44:26.201
like the one when we got the threshold crest?

01:44:26.481 --> 01:44:29.220
That one had like a big ruby on it that we took.

01:44:29.221 --> 01:44:31.140
MATT: Correct, this one it would be

01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:32.890
within either its head or its chest,

01:44:32.891 --> 01:44:34.720
are the two areas you would look for that.

01:44:34.721 --> 01:44:36.150
LIAM: It's a very advanced--

01:44:36.151 --> 01:44:37.540
SAM: I took one from the last one.

01:44:37.541 --> 01:44:41.220
MATT: Yeah, you took a sphere

01:44:41.221 --> 01:44:42.821
from the center of the last one.

01:44:43.758 --> 01:44:45.320
SAM: I'll go just check it out

01:44:45.321 --> 01:44:47.130
and see if this one has the same thing.

01:44:47.131 --> 01:44:48.496
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I feel like

01:44:48.497 --> 01:44:50.296
if we could figure out how to wake them up, man.

01:44:50.297 --> 01:44:51.221
MATT: If you glance inside,

01:44:51.222 --> 01:44:54.800
you can see the chest portion of it is off-kilter.

01:44:54.801 --> 01:44:56.630
It seemed to have been impacted,

01:44:56.631 --> 01:44:58.100
and the crushing of its legs,

01:44:58.101 --> 01:44:59.940
its chest plate split open on the inside.

01:44:59.941 --> 01:45:03.330
You can see it already has a gem placed in there

01:45:03.331 --> 01:45:05.403
but it is cracked.

01:45:05.404 --> 01:45:09.070
LAURA: Hmm, (gasps) put the other one in this one!

01:45:11.191 --> 01:45:14.039
SAM: Yes, and--

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.606
I'm not--

01:45:15.607 --> 01:45:16.631
my hands are very good,

01:45:16.632 --> 01:45:18.800
but do we need some, like,

01:45:18.801 --> 01:45:21.370
does anyone have any better mechanical knowledge than me?

01:45:21.371 --> 01:45:23.157
I guess not, right?

01:45:23.158 --> 01:45:23.991
TALIESIN: Probably not.

01:45:23.992 --> 01:45:26.600
SAM: Okay. All right.

01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:28.814
LAURA: I think you're the best. I can assist you.

01:45:29.901 --> 01:45:31.380
SAM: Sure, you're a medicine woman.

01:45:31.381 --> 01:45:33.157
LAURA: Uh-huh.
SAM: Yeah.

01:45:33.158 --> 01:45:34.730
LAURA: I'm good with medicine.
SAM: Want to do a quick heart transplant

01:45:34.731 --> 01:45:37.520
on a dead robot from a thousand years ago?

01:45:37.521 --> 01:45:39.260
Cool, all right.

01:45:39.261 --> 01:45:40.600
TALIESIN: It could go great or terribly.

01:45:40.601 --> 01:45:42.700
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm here for it.
TALIESIN: All right.

01:45:42.701 --> 01:45:45.800
SAM: What sort of skill is this?

01:45:45.801 --> 01:45:46.634
MATT: This--

01:45:46.634 --> 01:45:47.467
SAM: Animal handling.

01:45:47.468 --> 01:45:49.480
MATT: (laughs) So what are you trying to do?

01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:50.580
You're trying to--

01:45:50.581 --> 01:45:54.960
SAM: Cut out the existing sphere--

01:45:54.961 --> 01:45:55.794
MATT: Okay.

01:45:55.795 --> 01:45:58.760
SAM: -- heart thing and replace it with the new one

01:45:58.761 --> 01:46:00.310
in a similar connection.

01:46:00.311 --> 01:46:01.254
Are there connections?

01:46:01.255 --> 01:46:03.060
Is it wires? What is this?

01:46:03.061 --> 01:46:06.970
MATT: It looks just like a half-dome slot

01:46:06.971 --> 01:46:07.980
that it slips into.

01:46:07.981 --> 01:46:12.460
SAM: Oh, so it's not, like, arteries or anything.

01:46:12.461 --> 01:46:15.031
MATT: There is cabling all throughout the inside,

01:46:16.371 --> 01:46:19.200
but nothing you're familiar with.

01:46:19.201 --> 01:46:21.461
This would be just a dexterity check.

01:46:21.462 --> 01:46:22.570
SAM: Oh, I think I'm okay.

01:46:22.571 --> 01:46:23.624
LAURA: Give you some Guidance.

01:46:23.625 --> 01:46:24.621
SAM: Thank you.

01:46:24.621 --> 01:46:25.472
LIAM: It's Bishop.

01:46:25.473 --> 01:46:28.700
TALIESIN: Oh Caleb, just a Death Ward (clicks tongue).

01:46:28.701 --> 01:46:29.960
SAM: Dexterity check.

01:46:29.961 --> 01:46:31.459
MATT: So just add your dexterity modifier.

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.462
LAURA: And then add a d4.

01:46:32.463 --> 01:46:34.120
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: You hit zero, you--

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:34.954
LIAM: Okay.

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:37.314
SAM: Ah! Not a real roll.
TALIESIN: Just because I'm nervous.

01:46:38.881 --> 01:46:39.924
SAM: 25.

01:46:40.811 --> 01:46:42.910
MATT: 25.

01:46:42.911 --> 01:46:45.740
As you reach in to grab the initial sphere,

01:46:45.741 --> 01:46:49.697
it would show resistance if you didn't twist it

01:46:49.698 --> 01:46:51.600
in just the way that you feel it (popping) pop out.

01:46:51.601 --> 01:46:53.870
As it does, it immediately breaks into three pieces.

01:46:53.871 --> 01:46:55.900
It just shatters like glass,

01:46:55.901 --> 01:46:57.590
on the inside of the torso.

01:46:57.591 --> 01:46:58.630
With that you glance inside

01:46:58.631 --> 01:47:02.190
and you can see a faint connective,

01:47:02.191 --> 01:47:05.050
almost like a threaded point.

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:06.390
And you take the orb that you found earlier

01:47:06.391 --> 01:47:07.990
and you can see a similar point there.

01:47:07.991 --> 01:47:11.270
And as you screw and place it within,

01:47:11.271 --> 01:47:14.770
you lift up and place it heavily towards

01:47:14.771 --> 01:47:15.604
where it looks like it slips in.

01:47:15.605 --> 01:47:18.071
As it does (clicking)

01:47:19.731 --> 01:47:20.756
and it's there.

01:47:23.401 --> 01:47:25.484
SAM: Hey, hey.

01:47:26.837 --> 01:47:28.650
MATT: (mechanical poof) Eyes,
(screaming)

01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:33.651
suddenly brightly glow a dull blue hue.

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:36.740
The arms comes up and you watch as his body

01:47:36.741 --> 01:47:39.110
begins to convulse and shift for a second.

01:47:39.111 --> 01:47:41.293
(dish, dish) (thudding).

01:47:41.294 --> 01:47:43.416
Before all of a sudden (snapping)

01:47:44.981 --> 01:47:47.306
"(robotic foreign language)"

01:47:47.307 --> 01:47:48.251
LIAM: You got an hour.

01:47:48.252 --> 01:47:50.691
MATT: Right, you have an hour. You hear,

01:47:50.692 --> 01:47:52.250
LAURA: (gasps)

01:47:52.251 --> 01:47:53.231
MATT: "Hello.

01:47:53.232 --> 01:47:57.600
"My designation-- there is no record of that designation.

01:47:57.601 --> 01:47:59.064
"Please offer a designation."

01:48:00.174 --> 01:48:01.257
TALIESIN: It wants a name.

01:48:02.471 --> 01:48:05.245
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: Brashaar of the Praesidis Ward.

01:48:05.246 --> 01:48:08.600
SAM: Wait, you're going to name
it after the thing that died--

01:48:08.601 --> 01:48:10.240
LAURA: Oh, I see, it needs a name.

01:48:10.241 --> 01:48:11.858
Sorry, I thought it was like a password or something.

01:48:11.859 --> 01:48:13.399
SAM: Oh.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.774
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, let's give it a name, let's say--

01:48:17.641 --> 01:48:21.123
SAM: Something relatable, like XR1513.

01:48:21.124 --> 01:48:23.720
(laughter)

01:48:23.721 --> 01:48:24.654
I don't know.

01:48:24.655 --> 01:48:28.186
LAURA: What about Diddy or Daddy or Deddy?

01:48:28.187 --> 01:48:29.420
SAM: (laughs)

01:48:29.421 --> 01:48:30.901
LAURA: Oh, Doty!
ASHLEY: Chappie.

01:48:30.902 --> 01:48:32.890
(laughter)

01:48:32.891 --> 01:48:33.804
SAM: That's stupid.

01:48:33.805 --> 01:48:35.300
(laughter)

01:48:35.301 --> 01:48:36.816
TALIESIN: Charlie it is.

01:48:36.817 --> 01:48:38.303
MARISHA: Charlie!

01:48:38.304 --> 01:48:39.137
ASHLEY: Charlie.

01:48:39.138 --> 01:48:40.203
TALIESIN: I like 'C' names.

01:48:42.381 --> 01:48:47.070
MATT: "Charlie. I am designation Charlie.

01:48:47.071 --> 01:48:50.850
"I am an Aeormaton citizen of Aeor.

01:48:50.851 --> 01:48:51.684
"Hello?"

01:48:51.685 --> 01:48:53.700
TALIESIN: Hello, do you speak Common?

01:48:53.701 --> 01:48:56.175
SAM: It's the cutest.
ASHLEY: I love him.

01:48:56.176 --> 01:48:58.980
MATT: "I do not understand your request."

01:48:58.981 --> 01:49:01.704
TALIESIN: Okay, how quickly can you learn new languages?

01:49:03.471 --> 01:49:07.710
MATT: "I do not recall. It appears I have sustained injury

01:49:07.711 --> 01:49:10.122
"to numerous parts of my self."

01:49:10.123 --> 01:49:14.421
And as he looks down, this genderless creature

01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:17.930
at the moment seems to pull itself back a bit

01:49:17.931 --> 01:49:19.200
and you can see its legs are shredded

01:49:19.201 --> 01:49:21.010
and the cables are leading behind

01:49:21.011 --> 01:49:22.111
and then just kind of--

01:49:23.478 --> 01:49:26.268
"It ap-- It ap-- It ap--

01:49:26.269 --> 01:49:29.560
"It appears I've sustained some injury."

01:49:29.561 --> 01:49:31.226
SAM: I will die for this creature--
LAURA: Is he in pain?

01:49:31.227 --> 01:49:32.784
TALIESIN: Do you remember what happened?

01:49:35.161 --> 01:49:37.900
MATT: "I do not. My systems are damaged.

01:49:37.901 --> 01:49:39.750
"Perhaps the Genesis Ward may allow me

01:49:39.751 --> 01:49:42.850
"to reboot and present myself."

01:49:42.851 --> 01:49:44.810
TALIESIN: Where would the Genesis Ward be?

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:45.990
MARISHA: Oh lord.

01:49:45.991 --> 01:49:47.590
MATT: You see the eyes all of a sudden go wide

01:49:47.591 --> 01:49:49.520
and this like brief very faint scan

01:49:49.521 --> 01:49:53.230
goes (whooshing), in the space around.

01:49:53.231 --> 01:49:55.200
"Ah, that way."

01:49:55.201 --> 01:49:58.120
And it points loosely in the direction

01:49:58.121 --> 01:50:00.300
that you were already going to travel.

01:50:00.301 --> 01:50:02.820
TALIESIN: I think this is a very good idea.

01:50:02.821 --> 01:50:04.950
Would you like to? May I?

01:50:04.951 --> 01:50:05.931
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yes.

01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:07.800
TALIESIN: Would you like to come with us?

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:10.060
We can maybe take you there?

01:50:10.061 --> 01:50:12.400
It is dangerous and we will need help.

01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:17.401
And I might become difficult to understand at some point,

01:50:17.531 --> 01:50:19.421
but if you can just keep guiding us

01:50:20.391 --> 01:50:23.410
towards where we need to take you to fix yourself,

01:50:23.411 --> 01:50:25.000
we would be most grateful.

01:50:25.001 --> 01:50:27.440
MATT: "I must ask permission from my associates."

01:50:27.441 --> 01:50:28.436
SAM: Oh no.

01:50:28.437 --> 01:50:33.010
(laughter)

01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:36.740
"I do not recall my associates, so I will be my associate.

01:50:36.741 --> 01:50:39.290
"You will be my associate.

01:50:39.291 --> 01:50:40.340
"Charlie will come with you."

01:50:40.341 --> 01:50:43.870
TALIESIN: Happy to be an associate,
Charlie. This is everybody.

01:50:43.871 --> 01:50:45.680
There's a lot of dangerous people around here,

01:50:45.681 --> 01:50:48.964
just assume if it's not us, it might be a problem.

01:50:48.965 --> 01:50:50.710
MARISHA: Caduceus, how's stealthy is he?

01:50:50.711 --> 01:50:53.390
TALIESIN: Well, stealthy right now, not very--

01:50:53.391 --> 01:50:55.360
MATT: Yeah, as you're saying this,
he's starting to stand up,

01:50:55.361 --> 01:50:56.808
and then (clattering).

01:50:56.809 --> 01:50:58.386
MARISHA: Oh no, no, no!

01:50:58.387 --> 01:50:59.970
LAURA: I can carry him, or you can--

01:50:59.971 --> 01:51:02.824
SAM: Wait, do we have all of your parts?

01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:05.290
I know they're not connected to you,

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:06.820
but are all of your parts nearby

01:51:06.821 --> 01:51:07.801
that we can maybe collect?

01:51:07.802 --> 01:51:09.616
MATT: You hear this faint repetition of your voice.

01:51:09.617 --> 01:51:12.766
"All of your parts nearby-- (rapid gibberish)"

01:51:12.767 --> 01:51:14.557
and then responds in perfect Common.

01:51:14.558 --> 01:51:16.610
(gasping)

01:51:16.611 --> 01:51:17.561
MATT: Answering your question.

01:51:17.562 --> 01:51:18.850
TALIESIN: Well, that helps.

01:51:18.851 --> 01:51:19.684
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:51:19.685 --> 01:51:22.934
MATT: "I have only the parts of myself present."

01:51:24.651 --> 01:51:26.866
TALIESIN: I say in the other language: Show off.

01:51:26.867 --> 01:51:28.350
(laughter)

01:51:28.351 --> 01:51:33.294
TRAVIS: Do you have any offensive or defensive capabilities?

01:51:35.901 --> 01:51:38.470
MATT: "No, I am a companion."

01:51:38.471 --> 01:51:39.545
TRAVIS: Cool. Cool.

01:51:39.546 --> 01:51:40.927
LAURA: Are you in pain?

01:51:40.928 --> 01:51:41.761
TRAVIS: No, no.

01:51:41.762 --> 01:51:44.240
MATT: "I am not engineered to feel pain."

01:51:44.241 --> 01:51:45.074
LAURA: Okay.

01:51:45.075 --> 01:51:47.650
SAM: Can we fix you? Your injuries?

01:51:47.651 --> 01:51:49.540
TALIESIN: Yeah, the Genesis Ward.

01:51:49.541 --> 01:51:50.765
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.
MATT: "Indeed."

01:51:50.766 --> 01:51:52.112
TALIESIN: Let's go.

01:51:52.113 --> 01:51:55.030
LAURA: I'll pick him up and I'll strap you on my back

01:51:55.031 --> 01:51:57.195
like Chewbacca carried C3PO.

01:51:57.196 --> 01:51:58.072
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

01:51:58.073 --> 01:51:59.400
(laughter)

01:51:59.401 --> 01:52:01.901
MATT: "I do not understand this reference, but certainly."

01:52:02.991 --> 01:52:04.187
TRAVIS: Neither does anyone else.

01:52:04.188 --> 01:52:06.900
LIAM: Charlie, are you familiar with this entire city?

01:52:06.901 --> 01:52:08.510
MATT: "This is Aeor."

01:52:08.511 --> 01:52:10.810
LIAM: Yes, do you know it backwards and forwards?

01:52:10.811 --> 01:52:14.430
MATT: "T-t-t-- I have an internal map

01:52:14.431 --> 01:52:16.754
"(rising and falling tones) ah-- of Aeor."

01:52:16.755 --> 01:52:20.988
(laughter)

01:52:21.831 --> 01:52:25.187
TALIESIN: Well, we're letting the
high kid guide us, I suppose.

01:52:25.188 --> 01:52:27.042
So this'll at least be an adventure.

01:52:27.043 --> 01:52:29.660
LAURA: Is it possible for you to talk very quietly?

01:52:29.661 --> 01:52:31.951
MATT: "(quietly) I can speak very (louder) quiet--

01:52:31.952 --> 01:52:34.718
"ch-ch-- ly. (final tone continues)"

01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:36.793
MARISHA: Can you not speak at all?
MATT: (tone continues)

01:52:36.794 --> 01:52:37.888
ASHLEY: I give him a tap.
MATT: (tone continues)

01:52:37.889 --> 01:52:40.524
MATT: "Hi. Hello, I'm Charlie."

01:52:41.490 --> 01:52:42.323
MARISHA: Hi.

01:52:42.324 --> 01:52:44.561
TALIESIN: Let's get to the Genesis Ward, I think.

01:52:46.028 --> 01:52:47.880
MARISHA: Shh, Charlie, shh.

01:52:47.881 --> 01:52:51.920
TALIESIN: Oh, this is Beau. I'm Caduceus.

01:52:51.921 --> 01:52:53.200
Let's go around.

01:52:53.201 --> 01:52:54.299
ASHLEY: Hello, I'm Yasha.

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.133
SAM: Veth.

01:52:55.134 --> 01:52:56.238
LIAM: Caleb Widogast.

01:52:56.239 --> 01:52:57.450
LAURA: I'm Jester.

01:52:57.451 --> 01:52:58.500
TRAVIS: Fjord.

01:52:58.501 --> 01:52:59.860
MATT: "I'm Charlie."

01:52:59.861 --> 01:53:00.694
TALIESIN: Excellent.

01:53:00.694 --> 01:53:01.527
LIAM: This is Essek.

01:53:02.617 --> 01:53:03.450
MATT: (as Charlie) "Essek."

01:53:03.451 --> 01:53:06.099
Essek steps back and goes, "I don't trust it."

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:07.862
(laughter)

01:53:07.863 --> 01:53:08.963
TALIESIN: Good.
MARISHA: He's smart.

01:53:10.251 --> 01:53:11.440
TALIESIN: We need to get moving.

01:53:11.441 --> 01:53:12.664
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.
LIAM: Yes.

01:53:15.681 --> 01:53:17.804
MATT: "Well, lead on."

01:53:19.458 --> 01:53:20.291
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

01:53:20.292 --> 01:53:21.390
TRAVIS: Head back to the road.

01:53:21.391 --> 01:53:23.490
MATT: Jester carrying Charlie on her back,

01:53:23.491 --> 01:53:25.370
you all quietly begin to make your way

01:53:25.371 --> 01:53:26.970
to the exit of the amphitheater.

01:53:26.971 --> 01:53:30.200
Essek staying a safe 15 feet behind

01:53:30.201 --> 01:53:32.651
before brushing up next to you and going,

01:53:34.751 --> 01:53:36.804
"You do know about Aeor, right?"

01:53:37.841 --> 01:53:38.910
LIAM: A decent amount.

01:53:38.911 --> 01:53:40.161
What are you alluding to?

01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:45.350
MATT: "Well, many things were designed for warfare here,

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:46.974
"against the gods themselves.

01:53:48.511 --> 01:53:53.496
"Just be careful of trusting anything at face value."

01:53:55.071 --> 01:53:57.171
LIAM: I haven't done that in a very long time.

01:53:58.721 --> 01:53:59.554
MATT: "You may live yet."

01:53:59.554 --> 01:54:00.387
LIAM: Stay close.

01:54:01.719 --> 01:54:04.290
MATT: And as you all begin to drift into the shadow.

01:54:04.291 --> 01:54:05.188
We're going to take a break.

01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:07.569
ALL: Ooh!

01:54:07.570 --> 01:54:11.032
MATT: Be back here in few minutes.
ALL: Charlie!

01:54:11.033 --> 01:54:12.923
TALIESIN: Name's Charlie.

01:54:12.924 --> 01:54:14.460
MATT: An Aeormaton.
LAURA: Charlie.

01:54:14.461 --> 01:54:16.781
SAM: Wow. Aeor--?

01:54:16.782 --> 01:54:18.081
TALIESIN and MATT: Aeormaton.

01:54:18.082 --> 01:54:19.922
LIAM: Named after good old Charlie.

01:54:19.923 --> 01:54:22.561
MATT: Aww.
LAURA: He lives!

01:54:22.562 --> 01:54:24.520
LIAM: Good old Charlie.

01:54:24.521 --> 01:54:26.694
MATT: All right, we'll see you guys
here in a few minutes.

01:54:27.055 --> 01:54:32.684
(ominous music)

01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:37.709
Narrator: Dwarvenite, the most precious substance

01:54:37.835 --> 01:54:39.458
among dwarven smiths,

01:54:41.355 --> 01:54:45.072
able to absorb the very spirit of the craftsman.

01:54:51.398 --> 01:54:56.398
Thus infused, it becomes nearly indestructible,

01:54:58.541 --> 01:55:02.548
able to forge heirlooms that will last for generations.

01:55:04.623 --> 01:55:06.956
(exploding)

01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:14.603
Pure dwarvenite,

01:55:16.105 --> 01:55:21.105
now you can get your hands on this legendary substance

01:55:21.105 --> 01:55:23.505
with the new Dungeon of Doom,

01:55:25.148 --> 01:55:27.981
available now at dwarvenforge.com.

01:55:35.278 --> 01:55:38.278
(adventurous music)

01:56:05.205 --> 01:56:07.835
That is also just the most perfect performance

01:56:07.835 --> 01:56:09.155
I've seen Travis do.
I mean-

01:56:09.155 --> 01:56:10.415
In any arena

01:56:10.415 --> 01:56:11.248
doing anything.
It was so good.

01:56:11.248 --> 01:56:12.081
It was rehearsed.

01:56:12.081 --> 01:56:13.124
It had to be rehearsed.
Mr Willingham,

01:56:13.124 --> 01:56:15.096
you're accepted to Julliard.

01:56:15.096 --> 01:56:16.885
(laughing)

01:56:16.885 --> 01:56:18.635
All it took was the Chutney monologue

01:56:18.635 --> 01:56:21.026
made popular here on Narrative Telephone.

01:56:21.026 --> 01:56:22.540
Oh my god, how amazing would it be

01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:26.318
if years from now we get word that someone was accepted

01:56:26.318 --> 01:56:28.706
into some institution

01:56:28.706 --> 01:56:30.715
using the Chutney monologue.
NYU.

01:56:30.715 --> 01:56:32.965
(laughing)

01:56:33.945 --> 01:56:36.862
(mysterious music)

01:56:50.005 --> 01:56:52.248
Welcome to the Critical Role after show.

01:56:53.250 --> 01:56:55.248
That's what Marisha wanted to call it.

01:56:56.230 --> 01:56:59.438
C R A S, cras.

01:57:00.676 --> 01:57:03.175
Do not slander me, like that

01:57:03.175 --> 01:57:04.008
you bitch.
CRAS.

01:57:04.008 --> 01:57:04.841
CRAS.

01:57:05.945 --> 01:57:07.829
Actually I would've signed off on that.

01:57:07.829 --> 01:57:09.145
I would've signed off on that.
So would I have.

01:57:09.145 --> 01:57:11.017
So would I have.

01:57:11.017 --> 01:57:12.108
Now we get-
No it would

01:57:12.108 --> 01:57:13.912
have to be like the

01:57:13.912 --> 01:57:16.067
[Marisha And Travis] Critical Role After Show Special.

01:57:16.067 --> 01:57:19.665
Yes, there you go.
Boom, so now.

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:21.665
Yeah, every week is special.

01:57:21.665 --> 01:57:22.505
Now instead-

01:57:22.505 --> 01:57:23.608
If we were canceled Brian

01:57:23.608 --> 01:57:25.196
that's what we'll name this show.

01:57:25.196 --> 01:57:27.415
Okay.
CRASS, yeah.

01:57:27.415 --> 01:57:28.824
Well that's fine.

01:57:28.824 --> 01:57:32.028
There's a whole line of people waiting to take my place.

01:57:34.265 --> 01:57:37.168
Many of them outside my house, which is weird.

01:57:39.515 --> 01:57:42.265
(relaxing music)

01:58:11.696 --> 01:58:16.696
(mysterious music)
(fast clacking)

01:58:39.935 --> 01:58:42.055
LAURA: Hey critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:58:42.055 --> 01:58:44.448
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:58:46.325 --> 01:58:49.168
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

01:58:52.673 --> 01:58:54.205
Roll an investigation if you want.

01:58:54.205 --> 01:58:56.288
It's basically perfect.

01:58:58.391 --> 01:59:01.558
Oh goodie, you can not just like my brother.

01:59:04.201 --> 01:59:07.245
Can you put donuts in this?

01:59:07.245 --> 01:59:08.882
Only one way to find out.

01:59:10.715 --> 01:59:13.028
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

01:59:13.925 --> 01:59:15.600
Don't worry there's a few more minutes in the break.

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:16.700
You've still got time.

01:59:22.595 --> 01:59:24.795
Like a symphony playing to an empty theater

01:59:24.795 --> 01:59:27.867
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

01:59:27.867 --> 01:59:32.485
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

01:59:32.485 --> 01:59:35.663
on the other side of the fourth wall.

01:59:35.663 --> 01:59:39.685
And what is this fourth wall separating the viewer

01:59:39.685 --> 01:59:41.045
from the creator?

01:59:41.045 --> 01:59:43.548
A portal to an often sought point of connection,

01:59:43.548 --> 01:59:47.148
or the Twitch subscription zone?

01:59:48.185 --> 01:59:49.257
On the rare occasion that you miss

01:59:49.257 --> 01:59:52.110
the live bacchanal boasted by the ragtag group

01:59:52.110 --> 01:59:54.379
of thespians on Thursday night,

01:59:54.379 --> 01:59:56.632
you may always view the show on demand

01:59:56.632 --> 02:00:01.632
in the shadowland known as the Twitch subscription zone.

02:00:01.685 --> 02:00:02.875
Picture if you will

02:00:02.875 --> 02:00:05.648
the necessary pieces to complete a jigsaw puzzle

02:00:05.648 --> 02:00:09.176
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

02:00:09.176 --> 02:00:13.005
You could of course subscribe with your debt rectangle

02:00:13.005 --> 02:00:15.798
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

02:00:15.798 --> 02:00:17.731
Perhaps you found yourself in possession

02:00:17.731 --> 02:00:20.568
of an Amazon Prime account.

02:00:21.615 --> 02:00:22.813
You would then wake up to discover

02:00:22.813 --> 02:00:24.918
a free Twitch subscription each month

02:00:24.918 --> 02:00:27.635
for a channel of your choosing.

02:00:27.635 --> 02:00:29.755
But this artifact demands renewal

02:00:29.755 --> 02:00:31.875
for you must resubscribe each month

02:00:31.875 --> 02:00:33.908
to quench its unyielding thirst.

02:00:34.885 --> 02:00:36.875
One need not walk alone.

02:00:36.875 --> 02:00:38.198
Those who have already found their way

02:00:38.198 --> 02:00:40.498
can illuminate the path for others

02:00:40.498 --> 02:00:43.768
via the gift a sub button on Twitch.

02:00:45.105 --> 02:00:47.482
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

02:00:47.482 --> 02:00:49.787
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil

02:00:49.787 --> 02:00:52.875
of this fourth wall.

02:00:52.875 --> 02:00:56.495
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

02:00:56.495 --> 02:00:59.365
And so ends another meandering digression,

02:00:59.365 --> 02:01:02.621
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

02:01:02.621 --> 02:01:06.938
to the region we call the Twitch subscription zone.

02:01:15.705 --> 02:01:17.168
You will subscribe.

02:01:18.358 --> 02:01:21.595
Twitch prime subscribe.

02:01:21.595 --> 02:01:23.398
Gift subscribe.

02:01:24.918 --> 02:01:26.448
Subscribe.

02:01:28.623 --> 02:01:31.123
(eerie music)

02:14:43.945 --> 02:14:45.564
MATT: And welcome back.

02:14:45.565 --> 02:14:47.172
So.

02:14:47.173 --> 02:14:48.688
The Mighty Nein,

02:14:48.689 --> 02:14:53.474
you have left the coliseum-type structure here,

02:14:53.475 --> 02:14:55.284
in the middle of the Praesidis Ward.

02:14:55.285 --> 02:14:59.684
You have acquired a new Aeormaton companion,

02:14:59.685 --> 02:15:02.035
which you've named Charlie, for the time being.

02:15:02.995 --> 02:15:05.134
First off, as you're heading back into the shadow

02:15:05.135 --> 02:15:05.985
to retrace your steps,

02:15:05.986 --> 02:15:07.954
I'd like you all to roll a stealth check.

02:15:07.955 --> 02:15:09.273
LIAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:15:09.274 --> 02:15:10.992
LAURA: Oh, Blessing of the Trickster.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:15:10.993 --> 02:15:12.209
SAM: Will Charlie roll as well?

02:15:12.210 --> 02:15:14.213
No, Charlie's on Jester.
LAURA: He's on my back, right?

02:15:14.214 --> 02:15:17.214
MATT: Correct. But I will roll to see if he stays quiet.

02:15:17.215 --> 02:15:19.264
TRAVIS: Keep his fucking mouth shut.

02:15:19.265 --> 02:15:20.098
TALIESIN: Oh, that's gross.

02:15:20.099 --> 02:15:21.924
MARISHA: Bad, or good?
LIAM: Bad.

02:15:21.925 --> 02:15:22.825
LAURA: Ooh.

02:15:22.825 --> 02:15:23.748
MATT: All righty.

02:15:23.749 --> 02:15:26.393
LIAM: Oh Vax, where are you?
MARISHA: These are bad noises.

02:15:26.394 --> 02:15:27.854
LAURA: It's hard to--
TRAVIS: 12.

02:15:27.855 --> 02:15:29.641
LAURA: It's hard to stealth when I've got

02:15:29.642 --> 02:15:31.714
an Aeormaton on my back.

02:15:31.715 --> 02:15:32.822
TRAVIS: You're stealthing for two.

02:15:32.823 --> 02:15:34.034
LAURA: I'm stealthing for two!

02:15:34.035 --> 02:15:35.794
Three! Technically.
MATT: "I have been purely quiet."

02:15:35.795 --> 02:15:38.383
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: What's your stealth?

02:15:38.384 --> 02:15:40.189
LAURA: Eight.
MATT: Okay.

02:15:40.190 --> 02:15:41.940
LIAM: <i>Sechs</i>.
MATT: Okay.

02:15:42.837 --> 02:15:44.227
SAM: 24.
MATT: Okay.

02:15:44.228 --> 02:15:45.710
ASHLEY: 19.
MATT: Okay.

02:15:45.711 --> 02:15:47.902
TALIESIN: Seven.
(groaning)

02:15:47.903 --> 02:15:49.825
MARISHA: 27.
LAURA: Okay.

02:15:52.175 --> 02:15:54.874
LIAM: Just like, three fifths bad.
LAURA: Oh no.

02:15:54.875 --> 02:15:55.708
MATT: Okay.

02:15:57.685 --> 02:16:01.571
LAURA: I think we're going to fight a gorilla.
LIAM: (whispering) Sex monstah.

02:16:01.572 --> 02:16:03.279
ASHLEY: (whispering) Sex monstah.

02:16:04.296 --> 02:16:07.354
(giggling)

02:16:07.355 --> 02:16:10.404
MATT: You continue on retracing your path,

02:16:10.405 --> 02:16:12.498
heading deeper into the Praesidis Ward,

02:16:13.805 --> 02:16:16.764
eventually passing by the familiar structure

02:16:16.765 --> 02:16:21.628
of the mausoleum that you had nearly investigated.

02:16:22.885 --> 02:16:24.074
And following the path

02:16:24.075 --> 02:16:28.414
that Veth and Beauregard had set before,

02:16:28.415 --> 02:16:31.974
eventually you begin to come upon the site

02:16:31.975 --> 02:16:35.268
of this gruesome battle that proceeded your arrival.

02:16:37.525 --> 02:16:38.875
Where do you go from there?

02:16:40.765 --> 02:16:42.656
SAM: Should we just--
TALIESIN: Straight on ahead, right?

02:16:42.657 --> 02:16:44.589
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: We're just going to walk right through?

02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:46.614
Or should we stealth through?
LAURA: Is there a blood trail going from here now?

02:16:46.615 --> 02:16:47.884
MATT: You are stealthing.

02:16:47.885 --> 02:16:49.718
SAM: Should we-- can you do your--

02:16:51.745 --> 02:16:53.634
TRAVIS: Invisibility?
SAM: Marine layer?

02:16:53.635 --> 02:16:54.468
TRAVIS: I can.

02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:56.351
It hasn't ever worked out in our advantage.

02:16:56.352 --> 02:16:59.748
SAM: I know, but we're just
moving through this space, right?

02:16:59.749 --> 02:17:01.099
LAURA: You have to be within five feet of Fjord

02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:02.654
in order to not be blinded.

02:17:02.655 --> 02:17:05.011
SAM: Yeah, I understand. But he can drop it.

02:17:05.012 --> 02:17:06.014
You can drop it, right?

02:17:06.015 --> 02:17:07.029
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:10.640
SAM: We would be like a moveable cloud.

02:17:11.485 --> 02:17:13.284
I don't know!
TALIESIN: But most of us couldn't see.

02:17:13.285 --> 02:17:16.526
TRAVIS: No, you can if we're all just in a honeycomb.

02:17:16.527 --> 02:17:18.823
LAURA: We literally would have to walk on you.

02:17:18.824 --> 02:17:21.799
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'd have to be in a little, tight group.

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:23.326
SAM: I can't see anyway.
TALIESIN: Oh wow, yeah.

02:17:23.327 --> 02:17:25.904
SAM: Doesn't bother-- I'll be outside
the little, tight cluster.

02:17:25.905 --> 02:17:27.008
Doesn't bother me.

02:17:29.735 --> 02:17:30.705
No?
TRAVIS: I think we just

02:17:30.706 --> 02:17:31.819
keep stealthing and we're okay.

02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:32.795
SAM: Okay.

02:17:32.796 --> 02:17:34.226
LAURA: Did they leave another blood trail?

02:17:34.227 --> 02:17:35.667
TRAVIS: Never worked out.

02:17:35.668 --> 02:17:37.949
MATT: You can make an investigation check, if you like.

02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:39.582
LIAM: You heard something here too, yeah?

02:17:39.583 --> 02:17:43.300
SAM: Yes, we heard a second--
a third sex monster.

02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:46.134
LAURA: 13.

02:17:48.925 --> 02:17:51.624
MATT: It's hard to tell if it was a trail,

02:17:51.625 --> 02:17:54.930
or if it's just spatterings of blood as part of this battle.

02:17:57.655 --> 02:17:59.584
I mean, the road continues onward.

02:17:59.585 --> 02:18:02.514
LAURA: That's true, and we know where they're going mostly.

02:18:02.515 --> 02:18:03.425
TRAVIS: We do?

02:18:03.425 --> 02:18:04.258
LAURA: Yeah.

02:18:04.259 --> 02:18:06.300
MARISHA: I saw it trail this way, right?

02:18:06.301 --> 02:18:07.184
TALIESIN: It's all going that way.

02:18:07.185 --> 02:18:08.599
MATT: You recall, somewhat,

02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:10.564
following the path you were traveling, yeah.

02:18:10.565 --> 02:18:12.954
MARISHA: From what I found last time.

02:18:12.955 --> 02:18:15.544
LAURA: Hey! Hey, Charlie.

02:18:15.545 --> 02:18:16.378
MATT: "Yes?"

02:18:16.379 --> 02:18:19.484
LAURA: Which way was the Somnovem Ward?

02:18:19.485 --> 02:18:21.983
SAM: Genesis Ward? Or--

02:18:21.984 --> 02:18:24.896
LIAM: Cognouza.
LAURA: Cognouza Ward.

02:18:24.897 --> 02:18:27.413
MATT: "Cogno-- cog-- cog--

02:18:27.414 --> 02:18:29.114
"Cognouza Ward.

02:18:34.185 --> 02:18:35.344
"Hi, I'm Charlie."

02:18:35.345 --> 02:18:36.384
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Oh.

02:18:36.385 --> 02:18:37.218
SAM: What?

02:18:38.565 --> 02:18:39.634
LAURA: Hi, Charlie.

02:18:39.635 --> 02:18:40.468
MATT: "Hello."

02:18:41.995 --> 02:18:43.584
SAM: Oh?
LIAM: Just over your shoulder,

02:18:43.585 --> 02:18:45.084
this conversation?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:18:45.085 --> 02:18:46.588
He's right here.

02:18:48.225 --> 02:18:49.821
LAURA: Do you remember us, Charlie?
LAURA: Sprinkle is

02:18:49.822 --> 02:18:52.239
deeply unsatisfied with this.
MATT: "Yes."

02:18:53.203 --> 02:18:55.477
TALIESIN: I mean--
SAM: Crushing Sprinkle.

02:18:55.478 --> 02:19:00.474
LIAM: Does that name mean anything to you? Cognouza Ward?

02:19:00.475 --> 02:19:02.862
MATT: "I recall it is a part of Aeor."

02:19:02.863 --> 02:19:03.696
LIAM: Yes.

02:19:03.697 --> 02:19:05.701
MATT: "Yes. A ward to the--"

02:19:08.935 --> 02:19:10.974
LIAM: Well, north is that way.

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.504
SAM: Maybe he's--
LIAM: So knowing that,

02:19:12.505 --> 02:19:14.084
do you know what the Cognouza Ward is?

02:19:14.085 --> 02:19:15.574
SAM: -- purposefully blocked.
MATT: "There is

02:19:15.575 --> 02:19:18.288
"much damage sustained to myself.

02:19:19.505 --> 02:19:21.584
"Upon recovery and repair,

02:19:21.585 --> 02:19:24.177
"perhaps I could better answer your questions."

02:19:24.178 --> 02:19:25.924
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Fair enough.

02:19:25.925 --> 02:19:28.485
SAM: Charlie, do you have a preferred pronoun?

02:19:30.835 --> 02:19:33.038
MATT: "'He' is acceptable."
SAM: Okay.

02:19:34.425 --> 02:19:35.888
We guessed right.

02:19:36.855 --> 02:19:38.254
MARISHA: Charlie can be a girl's name, too.

02:19:38.255 --> 02:19:39.374
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Well, don't worry.

02:19:39.375 --> 02:19:41.096
We've been saying "he" a lot, that's all.
MARISHA: Gender neutral name.

02:19:41.097 --> 02:19:42.678
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: That's true.

02:19:43.825 --> 02:19:45.524
TRAVIS: Charlie. Ryan. Those are awesome names.

02:19:45.525 --> 02:19:47.763
MARISHA: Yeah. Beau.
LAURA: Alex.

02:19:47.764 --> 02:19:50.084
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: "Thank you for asking."

02:19:50.085 --> 02:19:51.584
SAM: Sure.

02:19:51.585 --> 02:19:52.944
LAURA: Sam.

02:19:52.945 --> 02:19:54.644
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah?

02:19:54.645 --> 02:19:56.319
LAURA: Nothing.
SAM: Oh.

02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:57.212
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:19:57.213 --> 02:19:58.685
SAM: Let's keep going!

02:19:58.686 --> 02:20:01.690
MARISHA: We're just listing baby names over here.

02:20:01.691 --> 02:20:03.374
(laughter)

02:20:03.375 --> 02:20:04.744
MATT: All right.

02:20:04.745 --> 02:20:06.565
Trekking on past, you begin to

02:20:07.715 --> 02:20:11.334
approach where the heavy rock slope

02:20:11.335 --> 02:20:14.684
begins to cut across this main thoroughfare,

02:20:14.685 --> 02:20:16.824
essentially preventing continuation

02:20:16.825 --> 02:20:19.848
beyond where this road comes to an end at the stone.

02:20:21.735 --> 02:20:24.734
Right as you're reaching this portion,

02:20:24.735 --> 02:20:27.667
Caduceus, Beauregard, and Caleb,

02:20:27.668 --> 02:20:29.374
you begin to pick up the sound

02:20:29.375 --> 02:20:32.098
of what-- it's like a handful of tumbling rocks.

02:20:34.225 --> 02:20:35.215
MARISHA: Coming from where?

02:20:35.216 --> 02:20:36.684
MATT: From behind you.

02:20:36.685 --> 02:20:38.384
MARISHA: I turn around really quick,

02:20:38.385 --> 02:20:40.351
and I nudge Caduceus.

02:20:42.115 --> 02:20:44.164
TALIESIN: I'm paying very close attention.

02:20:44.165 --> 02:20:46.783
MARISHA: I tell everybody, shh shh shh!

02:20:46.784 --> 02:20:47.909
TRAVIS: We freeze.

02:20:53.455 --> 02:20:55.364
MATT: Nothing.

02:20:55.365 --> 02:20:57.114
TRAVIS: Divine Sense, 60 feet.

02:20:57.115 --> 02:20:58.360
Third charge.

02:21:01.335 --> 02:21:02.392
MATT: Nothing.

02:21:04.375 --> 02:21:05.208
SAM: Also--

02:21:07.205 --> 02:21:09.704
just-- I can see anything--

02:21:09.705 --> 02:21:12.272
or if I can hear, I can--

02:21:12.273 --> 02:21:14.864
I can sense anything invisible around us

02:21:14.865 --> 02:21:16.914
with a 10-foot radius.

02:21:16.915 --> 02:21:18.503
MATT: That is true.
SAM: Anything invisible?

02:21:20.965 --> 02:21:22.054
MATT: Nothing.

02:21:22.055 --> 02:21:23.454
TALIESIN: Just for fun, since we're doing this,

02:21:23.455 --> 02:21:24.946
Eyes Of The Grave.

02:21:25.895 --> 02:21:27.185
60 feet.

02:21:27.186 --> 02:21:30.140
TRAVIS: (explosions)
MATT: I know!

02:21:30.141 --> 02:21:31.524
(laughter)

02:21:31.525 --> 02:21:33.134
MATT: Nothing.

02:21:33.135 --> 02:21:34.564
TALIESIN: I like that you did that in the robot way,

02:21:34.565 --> 02:21:35.398
in Charlie's voice.

02:21:35.399 --> 02:21:37.923
That was nice. That was good bonus.

02:21:39.545 --> 02:21:44.058
Okay, let's move with eyes in the back of our head, so.

02:21:45.465 --> 02:21:48.534
MARISHA: Okay. Where does this go? The path?

02:21:48.535 --> 02:21:49.624
MATT: The path ends.

02:21:49.625 --> 02:21:50.974
You can go to the right or left,

02:21:50.975 --> 02:21:52.734
and follow the wall, if you'd like.

02:21:52.735 --> 02:21:53.568
Your choice.

02:21:53.569 --> 02:21:54.742
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:21:54.743 --> 02:21:57.874
MARISHA: Are there passages that extend on the right,

02:21:57.875 --> 02:21:59.640
or the left?
MATT: You don't see any yet.

02:21:59.641 --> 02:22:01.124
There's just a wall.
LAURA: Do we see blood on the ground?

02:22:01.125 --> 02:22:04.194
We see any blood on the ground going either direction?

02:22:04.195 --> 02:22:05.574
MATT: You could make a perception or investigation check,

02:22:05.575 --> 02:22:06.884
if you'd like.

02:22:06.885 --> 02:22:08.110
TALIESIN: I'll join in that.

02:22:09.445 --> 02:22:10.964
LAURA: Yeah, you're helping?

02:22:10.965 --> 02:22:11.865
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll help.

02:22:17.405 --> 02:22:18.674
LAURA: 15.

02:22:18.675 --> 02:22:19.508
MATT: 15.

02:22:21.285 --> 02:22:23.938
Nothing specifically catches your eye, unfortunately.

02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.510
LAURA: Hey, Charlie!

02:22:26.511 --> 02:22:29.584
MATT: "Yes."
LAURA: Can you see the ground?

02:22:29.585 --> 02:22:30.418
MATT: "I see it."

02:22:30.419 --> 02:22:31.876
LAURA: Can you scan the ground?

02:22:32.985 --> 02:22:34.391
Scan for blood.

02:22:35.373 --> 02:22:36.631
Enhance!

02:22:37.689 --> 02:22:38.999
LIAM: What are those words?

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.774
(laughter)

02:22:41.775 --> 02:22:43.137
TRAVIS: You're supposed to say "computer."

02:22:43.138 --> 02:22:45.448
MATT: "I do not see any blood nearby.

02:22:46.305 --> 02:22:47.621
"My apologies."

02:22:48.835 --> 02:22:50.168
LAURA: It's okay.

02:22:51.817 --> 02:22:54.106
MARISHA: I'm going to take the left.

02:22:55.325 --> 02:22:58.018
Just see just a little bit, feel around.

02:22:59.145 --> 02:23:01.354
TALIESIN: Charlie, which way to the Genesis Ward?

02:23:01.355 --> 02:23:02.394
Left or right?

02:23:02.395 --> 02:23:05.054
MATT: "This way," and points towards|
where the stone wall is.

02:23:05.055 --> 02:23:05.888
TALIESIN: Fair.

02:23:07.185 --> 02:23:08.018
All right.

02:23:08.019 --> 02:23:10.434
MARISHA: I'm just going to start feeling the wall,

02:23:10.435 --> 02:23:12.184
feeling for drafts.

02:23:12.185 --> 02:23:16.451
Is there any direction, as I head towards the left.

02:23:17.415 --> 02:23:19.288
This is the right. The left.

02:23:20.375 --> 02:23:21.454
LAURA: Is it like Labyrinth?

02:23:21.455 --> 02:23:22.524
Can we touch the wall?

02:23:22.525 --> 02:23:24.078
Can we go through the wall in front of us?

02:23:24.079 --> 02:23:26.224
(gasps)

02:23:26.225 --> 02:23:27.058
MATT: (impact)
LAURA: Okay.

02:23:27.059 --> 02:23:28.854
MATT: It's actual rock, sorry.

02:23:28.855 --> 02:23:30.038
So, to the right or the left?

02:23:30.039 --> 02:23:31.247
TALIESIN: Classic rock.

02:23:32.405 --> 02:23:33.385
MARISHA: Left.
TALIESIN: Left.

02:23:33.386 --> 02:23:35.004
MATT: Left.

02:23:35.005 --> 02:23:35.838
Okay.

02:23:37.555 --> 02:23:40.484
You follow along the side of this,

02:23:40.485 --> 02:23:45.014
somewhat extreme, angled stone

02:23:45.015 --> 02:23:46.704
falling point before it impacts.

02:23:46.705 --> 02:23:49.544
And a lot of the rock is fractured upward,

02:23:49.545 --> 02:23:51.024
and sticking out from the impact.

02:23:51.025 --> 02:23:54.574
You can see it's caused almost like the edge

02:23:54.575 --> 02:23:57.254
of a violently created volcanic cliff.

02:23:57.255 --> 02:23:59.255
Right here from the point of impact.

02:24:00.305 --> 02:24:05.254
As you move along, for about three, four minutes,

02:24:05.255 --> 02:24:07.084
eventually you see there is a portion

02:24:07.085 --> 02:24:12.014
where the stone itself is broken in two.

02:24:12.015 --> 02:24:14.314
Like, there's some sort of a heavy crack

02:24:14.315 --> 02:24:16.374
and an opening that leads, and continues on

02:24:16.375 --> 02:24:17.225
through the wall.

02:24:19.525 --> 02:24:20.720
MARISHA: I found a crack!

02:24:21.884 --> 02:24:25.204
MATT: (light knocking)
LAURA: (gasps)

02:24:25.205 --> 02:24:26.644
MARISHA: Is that another rock?

02:24:26.645 --> 02:24:28.553
LIAM: It's still behind us?

02:24:28.554 --> 02:24:31.634
LIAM: A little ways behind you, but you hear another sound.

02:24:31.635 --> 02:24:35.384
TALIESIN: I am scanning the horizon.

02:24:35.385 --> 02:24:37.552
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

02:24:37.553 --> 02:24:38.386
LAURA: Charlie!

02:24:39.485 --> 02:24:40.644
MATT: "Yes."

02:24:40.645 --> 02:24:43.106
LAURA: Scan the horizon for any lifeforms.

02:24:46.815 --> 02:24:48.124
TALIESIN: Big nope.

02:24:48.125 --> 02:24:49.194
MATT: Nope.
TALIESIN: No!

02:24:49.195 --> 02:24:50.712
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: That was a one.

02:24:53.235 --> 02:24:57.274
MATT: "Light sources are challenged in this space.

02:24:57.275 --> 02:24:59.344
"Nothing can be perceived."

02:24:59.345 --> 02:25:01.844
TRAVIS: "Superior society," no night vision.

02:25:01.845 --> 02:25:03.202
Lame!

02:25:03.203 --> 02:25:07.174
(laughter)

02:25:07.175 --> 02:25:08.383
No offense, Charlie.

02:25:08.384 --> 02:25:09.491
(laughter)

02:25:09.492 --> 02:25:10.708
MATT: "None taken."

02:25:12.495 --> 02:25:13.784
SAM: Should we just run?

02:25:13.785 --> 02:25:16.864
MARISHA: Let's get in. Do you guys want to squeeze in here?

02:25:16.865 --> 02:25:18.715
It seems like it keeps going forward.

02:25:20.032 --> 02:25:21.944
Get through the wall.

02:25:21.945 --> 02:25:23.204
TALIESIN: Is there enough room?

02:25:23.205 --> 02:25:25.494
MARISHA: I think so, is there enough room?

02:25:25.495 --> 02:25:27.844
MATT: You come around the corner there,

02:25:27.845 --> 02:25:30.704
and you could see why the wall seems to have cracked.

02:25:30.705 --> 02:25:35.705
There is some very cleanly made,

02:25:35.995 --> 02:25:39.804
metallic, triangular entryway.

02:25:39.805 --> 02:25:41.374
Like it was the entrance to some sort of a

02:25:41.375 --> 02:25:44.924
large structure, or some sort of large building.

02:25:44.925 --> 02:25:48.574
And the entry point was this thick, metallic point.

02:25:48.575 --> 02:25:51.884
Almost like a blade with a tunnel within,

02:25:51.885 --> 02:25:53.924
and as the rock collided with it,

02:25:53.925 --> 02:25:55.804
it carved and broke.

02:25:55.805 --> 02:25:58.204
You can see it's bent to shit and ruined,

02:25:58.205 --> 02:26:01.774
and tangled somewhat to the side from where it hit.

02:26:01.775 --> 02:26:03.904
But as it did, it was just enough to

02:26:03.905 --> 02:26:08.484
split that element of the stone, and hold itself firm.

02:26:08.485 --> 02:26:11.694
And so there is indeed a passageway that leads beyond.

02:26:11.695 --> 02:26:13.814
LIAM: How far? Does it just go for awhile?

02:26:13.815 --> 02:26:15.584
Can we see how deep?

02:26:15.585 --> 02:26:17.544
MATT: It seems like it goes on

02:26:17.545 --> 02:26:20.594
for at least the edge of your visual range.

02:26:20.595 --> 02:26:23.224
Which without much of a light source here, is very short.

02:26:23.225 --> 02:26:25.464
MARISHA: It's a creepy tunnel.

02:26:25.465 --> 02:26:27.924
LIAM: So if there is something coming behind us,

02:26:27.925 --> 02:26:32.094
it would have to funnel in after us, same as us.

02:26:32.095 --> 02:26:34.364
Maybe we can get in,

02:26:34.365 --> 02:26:36.144
and if it's something big, it won't be able to follow.

02:26:36.145 --> 02:26:38.584
And if it's something our size, we can be ready for it.

02:26:38.585 --> 02:26:39.934
TRAVIS: Yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:26:39.935 --> 02:26:41.376
TRAVIS: [inaudible]

02:26:42.605 --> 02:26:43.938
MARISHA: I start shimmying in.

02:26:45.002 --> 02:26:46.703
I'm goin' in.

02:26:46.704 --> 02:26:47.918
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yasha?

02:26:47.919 --> 02:26:48.926
ASHLEY: Yep.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:26:48.927 --> 02:26:50.609
LIAM: Watch your step. Watch your step.

02:26:50.610 --> 02:26:52.175
ASHLEY: I get behind her.
MATT: Okay.

02:26:53.095 --> 02:26:54.277
You are welcome to shimmy.

02:26:54.278 --> 02:26:56.568
The space is wide enough where you do not need to do that.

02:26:56.569 --> 02:26:57.664
(laughter)

02:26:57.665 --> 02:26:59.504
But who am I to stop you?

02:26:59.505 --> 02:27:01.529
If you're feeling a shimmy coming on.

02:27:01.530 --> 02:27:05.367
(laughter)
TRAVIS: I've got low light, stealth move.

02:27:05.368 --> 02:27:07.489
Disrupt the air.
(laughter)

02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:10.604
MATT: While the entryway itself is bent and fucked up

02:27:10.605 --> 02:27:13.327
in its own right, there is about an eight-foot wide space,

02:27:13.328 --> 02:27:15.730
from what was once about 15 feet across.

02:27:15.731 --> 02:27:18.708
LIAM: Just two wild and crazy girls.

02:27:18.709 --> 02:27:19.725
(laughter)

02:27:19.726 --> 02:27:21.746
ASHLEY: Two wild and crazy girls.

02:27:23.204 --> 02:27:25.192
TRAVIS: God, oh my god.

02:27:25.193 --> 02:27:27.153
MATT: All right, so we have Beau and Yasha up front.

02:27:27.154 --> 02:27:29.410
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

02:27:29.411 --> 02:27:30.957
Stop that!
MARISHA: I thought this was

02:27:30.958 --> 02:27:32.876
a musical number.
ASHLEY: Use your stealth.

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:33.710
MATT: Are the rest of you waiting?

02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:34.703
Or are you moving in behind?

02:27:34.704 --> 02:27:36.424
LAURA: I think we're going in behind.

02:27:36.425 --> 02:27:37.654
MATT: Okay, who's after them?

02:27:37.655 --> 02:27:40.254
LIAM: We're walking in the dark?

02:27:40.255 --> 02:27:41.484
TRAVIS: So far.
MATT: Yeah.

02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:43.576
TALIESIN: Once we're inside--
TRAVIS: We have to light it up soon.

02:27:45.418 --> 02:27:46.633
MATT: Who's second wave?

02:27:46.634 --> 02:27:48.794
LAURA: I'll come in second

02:27:48.795 --> 02:27:50.604
with Charlie.

02:27:50.605 --> 02:27:51.984
MATT: Okay.

02:27:51.985 --> 02:27:54.534
I should've gotten a Charlie mini,

02:27:54.535 --> 02:27:56.108
but we'll say he's on your back.

02:27:57.495 --> 02:27:59.513
TRAVIS: I will be in the rear.

02:27:59.514 --> 02:28:03.059
LIAM: I will join you in the rear.

02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:04.874
LAURA: (cackles)

02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:06.727
TRAVIS: Fans will love that.

02:28:06.728 --> 02:28:08.177
(laughter)

02:28:08.178 --> 02:28:11.094
MATT: Essek will travel with Caduceus in the center.

02:28:11.095 --> 02:28:12.372
Veth, are you--?

02:28:12.373 --> 02:28:13.434
SAM: Middle.
MATT: Middle?

02:28:13.435 --> 02:28:15.888
All right, that's you in that space there.

02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:20.461
LIAM: Anyone opposed to me making a globule right here?

02:28:20.462 --> 02:28:21.650
TRAVIS: No.
LIAM: I'm going to do that.

02:28:21.651 --> 02:28:23.764
TRAVIS: Are you opposed to me lighting up my sword?

02:28:23.765 --> 02:28:25.334
LIAM: That's fine, too.
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

02:28:25.335 --> 02:28:27.514
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Was thinking that as well.

02:28:27.515 --> 02:28:29.274
MATT: You step a little bit in towards the space

02:28:29.275 --> 02:28:32.064
and it's getting chillier,

02:28:32.065 --> 02:28:34.338
as you progress into this room.

02:28:35.385 --> 02:28:37.564
The chamber inside most of the city,

02:28:37.565 --> 02:28:40.270
it seemed to emanate a...

02:28:42.295 --> 02:28:45.024
a sourceless sense of warmth,

02:28:45.025 --> 02:28:46.674
or at least controlled weather

02:28:46.675 --> 02:28:50.484
based on the icy exterior of the city.

02:28:50.485 --> 02:28:53.534
As you begin to step into this space,

02:28:53.535 --> 02:28:57.334
that quickly fades, and you can see frost and ice

02:28:57.335 --> 02:28:59.811
gathered on the edges of

02:28:59.812 --> 02:29:01.204
the inside of this metallic hallway,

02:29:01.205 --> 02:29:03.294
and stone is broken through in places.

02:29:03.295 --> 02:29:05.974
And eventually, it begins to give away

02:29:05.975 --> 02:29:09.334
to just a natural, ice covered tunnel space.

02:29:09.335 --> 02:29:11.371
LAURA: I forgot it's actually cold down here.

02:29:11.372 --> 02:29:12.414
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:29:12.415 --> 02:29:13.864
MARISHA: Do you think that they just kept it

02:29:13.865 --> 02:29:15.894
nice and temperate all year long?

02:29:15.895 --> 02:29:17.830
LAURA: Probably.
MARISHA: It's pretty nice.

02:29:17.831 --> 02:29:19.030
LIAM: Central air.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:29:19.031 --> 02:29:22.038
TRAVIS: We light up the globule and the Star Razor.

02:29:22.901 --> 02:29:23.994
MATT: (foomphing)

02:29:23.995 --> 02:29:26.724
You fill the space in front of you, and the tunnel ahead.

02:29:26.725 --> 02:29:29.584
Your vision is able to crystallize

02:29:29.585 --> 02:29:30.854
on the details around you.

02:29:30.855 --> 02:29:34.064
And this is a space where you can see the structure

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:37.604
you walk through was structurally battling

02:29:37.605 --> 02:29:41.189
with the impact of the city.

02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:42.881
It doesn't look like there is a continuous fall

02:29:42.882 --> 02:29:44.838
of rock above, but it looks like

02:29:44.839 --> 02:29:46.744
elements of the ceiling above you

02:29:46.745 --> 02:29:48.994
is bent and shifted.

02:29:48.995 --> 02:29:51.895
Some areas, you have to push a little bit through.

02:29:53.185 --> 02:29:54.434
TRAVIS: As we move forward, I am looking

02:29:54.435 --> 02:29:56.114
strictly at our six o'clock.

02:29:56.115 --> 02:29:57.177
LIAM: Yeah. Same.
MATT: You got it.

02:29:57.178 --> 02:29:58.145
Make a perception check, please,

02:29:58.145 --> 02:29:59.128
both of you.
LIAM: Head on a swivel.

02:29:59.128 --> 02:29:59.961
SAM: I'm going to look down and

02:29:59.962 --> 02:30:02.674
see if there's any more blood.

02:30:02.675 --> 02:30:04.472
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

02:30:04.473 --> 02:30:05.681
TRAVIS: 19.
LIAM: 22.

02:30:05.682 --> 02:30:06.515
LAURA: Can I give you Guidance?

02:30:06.516 --> 02:30:08.030
MATT: 19, 22. Okay.

02:30:08.031 --> 02:30:09.618
LAURA: Or help you in any way?

02:30:11.442 --> 02:30:14.084
SAM: Who, me? Oh. 23.

02:30:14.085 --> 02:30:15.035
LAURA: That's pretty good.

02:30:15.036 --> 02:30:17.384
Do you want to take advantage on it, if I'm helping you?

02:30:17.385 --> 02:30:18.368
SAM: Yeah, sure.

02:30:19.525 --> 02:30:20.358
23.

02:30:20.359 --> 02:30:21.999
MATT: (laughs)

02:30:23.605 --> 02:30:25.005
LAURA: Plus I gave you Guidance.

02:30:27.835 --> 02:30:28.900
SAM: 25.

02:30:28.901 --> 02:30:30.509
MATT: 25.

02:30:32.795 --> 02:30:37.374
The bad news, with the shift to icier temperatures,

02:30:37.375 --> 02:30:40.084
in this segment of the hall,

02:30:40.085 --> 02:30:44.074
is it as much colder than you've gotten used to

02:30:44.075 --> 02:30:45.264
in recent travel.

02:30:45.265 --> 02:30:46.314
TRAVIS: Oh wow.

02:30:46.315 --> 02:30:48.114
MATT: The good news is,

02:30:48.115 --> 02:30:52.978
the layer of frost has made discoloration easier to see.

02:30:52.979 --> 02:30:54.249
And as you all begin to walk through,

02:30:54.250 --> 02:30:57.981
you glance down at the bit of whitish frost

02:30:57.982 --> 02:31:00.234
before your feet break through,

02:31:00.235 --> 02:31:03.438
and you can see little bits of red,

02:31:04.395 --> 02:31:07.484
just occasionally spattered there.

02:31:07.485 --> 02:31:08.684
Small drops.

02:31:08.685 --> 02:31:10.043
SAM: Pick one up.

02:31:12.545 --> 02:31:13.602
MATT: Barbecue sauce.

02:31:13.603 --> 02:31:18.603
(laughter)

02:31:18.663 --> 02:31:20.140
SAM: Mesquite!

02:31:20.141 --> 02:31:22.685
(laughter)

02:31:22.686 --> 02:31:25.656
TRAVIS: What I wouldn't do for some hickory.

02:31:25.657 --> 02:31:28.757
(laughter)

02:31:31.854 --> 02:31:34.694
SAM: I knew it. Tennessee style.

02:31:34.695 --> 02:31:36.607
TRAVIS: Molasses.

02:31:36.608 --> 02:31:38.454
MATT: Beau and Yasha,

02:31:38.455 --> 02:31:40.554
since you are towards the front,

02:31:40.555 --> 02:31:41.664
you see a little ways ahead

02:31:41.665 --> 02:31:44.988
the tunnel begins to open into a new chamber.

02:31:47.195 --> 02:31:49.936
Smaller than the massive,

02:31:49.937 --> 02:31:53.144
mile-, two mile-, three mile-wide

02:31:53.145 --> 02:31:56.424
city tunnel you had just traveled through the cavern.

02:31:56.425 --> 02:31:58.478
This looks to be an enclosed chamber.

02:31:59.795 --> 02:32:00.804
There is no light source

02:32:00.805 --> 02:32:03.344
beyond the ones your friends are carrying behind you,

02:32:03.345 --> 02:32:08.294
except for this faint, thrumming, blue light,

02:32:08.295 --> 02:32:11.124
that seems to be occasionally filling the space.

02:32:11.125 --> 02:32:14.248
You see darkness, and then a blue light fades in,

02:32:14.249 --> 02:32:16.994
and you can see a corner and a pillar.

02:32:16.995 --> 02:32:18.523
And then it fades away.

02:32:18.524 --> 02:32:20.114
And then it fades in and you can see once more.

02:32:20.115 --> 02:32:21.744
There's a pillar that goes beyond your view.

02:32:21.745 --> 02:32:23.404
You can just see within this entryway

02:32:23.405 --> 02:32:25.534
that leads into the interior chamber.

02:32:25.535 --> 02:32:28.135
And you can just barely make out the interior shape.

02:32:29.775 --> 02:32:32.780
MARISHA: Do you remember Lucien having anything like that?

02:32:32.781 --> 02:32:34.240
ASHLEY: I don't think so.

02:32:34.241 --> 02:32:35.324
MARISHA: Me neither.

02:32:37.614 --> 02:32:39.034
TALIESIN: This is the moment to remind everybody

02:32:39.035 --> 02:32:40.385
that we're a little tapped.

02:32:41.915 --> 02:32:43.338
MARISHA: All right.
ASHLEY: Oh fuck.

02:32:44.405 --> 02:32:47.055
MARISHA: I just turn back around to the rest of the group.

02:32:48.665 --> 02:32:49.538
Light up ahead.

02:32:52.655 --> 02:32:54.964
TRAVIS: Anything on our six o'clock?

02:32:54.965 --> 02:32:56.906
MATT: With your perception check? Not yet.

02:32:56.907 --> 02:32:59.851
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Not yet.

02:32:59.852 --> 02:33:01.214
It's coming.

02:33:01.215 --> 02:33:04.124
LAURA: Reminder that we all did eat a Heroes' Feast.

02:33:04.125 --> 02:33:07.484
MARISHA: Yes, queen.
LAURA: So you're immune to fear.

02:33:07.485 --> 02:33:09.094
Or, no. What is it?

02:33:09.095 --> 02:33:10.934
Advantage to saving throws on--

02:33:10.935 --> 02:33:12.184
I'm going to read the spell.

02:33:12.185 --> 02:33:13.928
MATT: You're immune to poison and fear,

02:33:13.929 --> 02:33:16.334
and you have advantage on wisdom saving throws.

02:33:16.335 --> 02:33:17.168
LAURA: Yeah.

02:33:20.015 --> 02:33:22.544
ASHLEY: Should we--
MARISHA: Go up ahead?

02:33:22.545 --> 02:33:23.536
ASHLEY: -- shimmy forward?

02:33:23.537 --> 02:33:24.864
MARISHA: Okay.

02:33:24.865 --> 02:33:27.258
We'll check it out. Hang on one second.

02:33:28.835 --> 02:33:30.236
SAM: Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, ya.

02:33:30.237 --> 02:33:31.863
TRAVIS: You sure you don't want to take Veth?

02:33:33.413 --> 02:33:34.912
ASHLEY: Veth?

02:33:34.913 --> 02:33:38.064
MARISHA: Veth wished for Jester to be with her earlier, so.

02:33:38.065 --> 02:33:39.914
LAURA: You did? You did?

02:33:39.915 --> 02:33:41.025
SAM: I did.

02:33:41.026 --> 02:33:42.404
LAURA: That's so wonderful.
SAM: You're my

02:33:42.405 --> 02:33:44.248
number one, original partner.

02:33:45.395 --> 02:33:47.004
But Beau was excellent.

02:33:47.005 --> 02:33:48.664
LAURA: Yeah, no. She's really great.

02:33:48.665 --> 02:33:49.498
SAM: Yeah.

02:33:49.499 --> 02:33:51.804
If you die at the end of season two,

02:33:51.805 --> 02:33:53.392
she's my new partner.

02:33:53.393 --> 02:33:55.421
LAURA: Foreshadowing!

02:33:55.422 --> 02:33:57.614
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:33:57.615 --> 02:33:59.724
MATT: So the two of you shimmy into the chamber?

02:33:59.725 --> 02:34:00.725
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:34:00.725 --> 02:34:01.558
MATT: All right.

02:34:02.635 --> 02:34:04.478
As you step into the space--

02:34:05.835 --> 02:34:06.844
MARISHA: Jazz hands.

02:34:06.845 --> 02:34:10.794
MATT: The room looks to be maybe 80 feet across or so.

02:34:10.795 --> 02:34:12.864
Mostly rectangular.

02:34:12.865 --> 02:34:14.254
And in comparison

02:34:14.255 --> 02:34:16.044
to a lot of the structures you've come across,

02:34:16.045 --> 02:34:18.514
this one is fairly well-kept.

02:34:18.515 --> 02:34:20.954
Beyond the entryway that you're coming through,

02:34:20.955 --> 02:34:25.000
some of the walls are still fairly intact.

02:34:27.095 --> 02:34:31.397
The sense of cold and ice seems to dissipate

02:34:31.398 --> 02:34:33.934
quickly into the room, which is odd.

02:34:33.935 --> 02:34:35.484
Like just a portion of that hallway

02:34:35.485 --> 02:34:38.344
seemed to give into the cold atmosphere.

02:34:38.345 --> 02:34:39.804
And then once more,

02:34:39.805 --> 02:34:42.864
the room seems to-- not that you feel the warmth

02:34:42.865 --> 02:34:44.234
with just the brief steps you've taken in.

02:34:44.235 --> 02:34:45.934
You're still standing in frost.

02:34:45.935 --> 02:34:50.634
Maybe 10 or so feet beyond where you stand, the ice stops,

02:34:50.635 --> 02:34:52.185
and gives way to just stone.

02:34:53.195 --> 02:34:55.151
Smooth stone floor.

02:34:55.152 --> 02:34:57.094
MATT: Elements of the interior walls

02:34:57.095 --> 02:35:00.014
that are reminiscent of some of the previous ruins

02:35:00.015 --> 02:35:01.794
that you've been to.

02:35:01.795 --> 02:35:02.914
You can see across from you,

02:35:02.915 --> 02:35:06.234
there appears to be a hallway entrance

02:35:06.235 --> 02:35:07.774
that continues outside of this chamber,

02:35:07.775 --> 02:35:11.664
and to your left, across the wall that way,

02:35:11.665 --> 02:35:14.768
there is a second hallway that exits in that direction.

02:35:16.025 --> 02:35:17.284
But not far from you,

02:35:17.285 --> 02:35:18.774
close to the center of this room,

02:35:18.775 --> 02:35:21.571
there is a raised pillar.

02:35:21.572 --> 02:35:23.654
And atop that, what looks to be

02:35:23.655 --> 02:35:28.630
a 15- or 20-foot-tall spire.

02:35:29.835 --> 02:35:32.135
And as you glance up, this room is quite tall.

02:35:33.425 --> 02:35:35.264
Taller than that spire, at least.

02:35:35.265 --> 02:35:36.616
Probably close to 80 feet tall.

02:35:36.617 --> 02:35:38.414
TRAVIS: Whoa.
SAM: Cool.

02:35:38.415 --> 02:35:41.204
MATT: And that spire is metallic and spirals upwards.

02:35:41.205 --> 02:35:43.424
At the top and throughout the center of it,

02:35:43.425 --> 02:35:48.425
there is this faint, blue light that (pulsing).

02:35:48.965 --> 02:35:50.265
TALIESIN: Well, this is a problem.

02:35:51.163 --> 02:35:53.634
MATT: And as it thrums, each time

02:35:53.635 --> 02:35:58.635
you can feel this energy in the room spike then fade.

02:35:59.335 --> 02:36:01.944
Spike and fade.

02:36:01.945 --> 02:36:03.714
And as you sense that, you look at each other,

02:36:03.715 --> 02:36:05.374
and as that sensation comes in,

02:36:05.375 --> 02:36:08.368
you can see the hair on the other person's head,

02:36:09.315 --> 02:36:12.274
mostly Yasha's, since yours is bound for the most part,

02:36:12.275 --> 02:36:15.424
begin to drift up a bit before dropping.

02:36:15.425 --> 02:36:16.681
SAM: Whoa, cool.

02:36:16.682 --> 02:36:19.591
MARISHA: It's like those-- I've seen this before.

02:36:19.592 --> 02:36:20.904
MATT: As you do that with your fingers,

02:36:20.905 --> 02:36:25.384
you can see bits of energy arc through your fingers

02:36:25.385 --> 02:36:28.184
to each side and give a slight staticky sound.

02:36:28.185 --> 02:36:29.724
MARISHA: This is really cool.

02:36:29.725 --> 02:36:34.234
We have to keep Veth far away. She's got explosives on her.

02:36:34.235 --> 02:36:36.674
ASHLEY: Yeah, she'll go up like a candle.

02:36:36.675 --> 02:36:38.734
MARISHA: Super--
TALIESIN: I'm going to be cold again.

02:36:38.735 --> 02:36:40.341
ASHLEY: Wait, put your finger out.

02:36:40.342 --> 02:36:41.500
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

02:36:42.439 --> 02:36:43.664
ASHLEY: Ow!
MARISHA: Ah!

02:36:44.824 --> 02:36:46.217
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

02:36:46.218 --> 02:36:48.114
SAM: (laughs)

02:36:48.115 --> 02:36:49.434
ASHLEY: That's a fun trick.
MARISHA: That's hot.

02:36:49.435 --> 02:36:50.268
Hang on. Wait, come here.

02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:51.929
Kiss me.

02:36:51.930 --> 02:36:53.109
Ah!
ASHLEY: Ow!

02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:55.054
MARISHA: It hurts.

02:36:55.055 --> 02:36:56.495
Okay, okay, okay, let's go.
ASHLEY: Like a battery.

02:36:56.496 --> 02:36:58.095
TRAVIS: (zapping, explosion)
Double kill.

02:36:58.096 --> 02:37:00.384
MATT: Yep. (laughs)

02:37:00.385 --> 02:37:01.985
Zero hit points.

02:37:01.986 --> 02:37:02.925
(laughter)

02:37:02.926 --> 02:37:05.103
LIAM: They both come out looking like Bride of Frankenstein.

02:37:05.104 --> 02:37:05.984
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:37:05.985 --> 02:37:07.583
ASHLEY: It's crazy in here!
MARISHA: It's great.

02:37:07.584 --> 02:37:09.324
LAURA: Didn't we see this kind of thing?

02:37:09.325 --> 02:37:10.694
We saw this kind of thing before, right?

02:37:10.695 --> 02:37:12.674
We saw it in the other place with the crest.

02:37:12.675 --> 02:37:13.508
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Slightly, but it

02:37:13.509 --> 02:37:14.699
summoned the golem that time.

02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:16.562
LAURA: Oh.

02:37:16.563 --> 02:37:17.604
ASHLEY: Ooh.

02:37:19.391 --> 02:37:21.850
TRAVIS: Right, Matt?
LAURA: Hey! Hey, Charlie.

02:37:21.851 --> 02:37:22.684
MATT: There are facets of it

02:37:22.685 --> 02:37:25.619
that remind you of a similar type of enchantment,

02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:27.269
though that one--

02:37:27.270 --> 02:37:28.494
TRAVIS: More structure?

02:37:28.495 --> 02:37:31.544
MATT: Yeah. This has more of an electrical feel to it.

02:37:31.545 --> 02:37:33.724
And even now that they've mentioned this,

02:37:33.725 --> 02:37:37.014
even in just this portion of the tunnel, a ways back,

02:37:37.015 --> 02:37:37.848
you can taste a change

02:37:37.849 --> 02:37:42.848
you can taste a change

02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:45.614
in the way the air meets your tongue.

02:37:45.615 --> 02:37:46.448
LIAM: Oh boy.

02:37:46.449 --> 02:37:49.196
LAURA: My skin feels very dry in here.

02:37:49.197 --> 02:37:50.030
Hey.

02:37:50.031 --> 02:37:51.395
LIAM: Are we in the tunnel still, though,

02:37:51.396 --> 02:37:52.229
talking about this?
MATT: Yeah.

02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:53.514
You're a little bit back

02:37:53.515 --> 02:37:54.674
from the mouth of the opening.

02:37:54.675 --> 02:37:56.159
ASHLEY: Yeah. We back up.
LAURA: Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:57.284
Charlie. Charlie, Charlie.

02:37:57.285 --> 02:37:58.255
MATT: "Yes?"

02:37:58.256 --> 02:38:01.264
LAURA: Have you ever seen-- well, you have.

02:38:01.265 --> 02:38:04.875
Do you know what that pulsing blue light is?

02:38:06.425 --> 02:38:07.464
MATT: "I do."

02:38:07.465 --> 02:38:09.674
LAURA: What is it?
MATT: "This is a security checkpoint."

02:38:09.675 --> 02:38:10.508
LAURA: How do you get through it,

02:38:10.509 --> 02:38:13.134
without toasting yourself alive?

02:38:13.135 --> 02:38:15.198
MATT: "Do not give it to reason to toast you."

02:38:16.715 --> 02:38:19.034
LAURA: Oh, so you can just walk right past it?

02:38:19.035 --> 02:38:20.619
MATT: "If you are approved to pass by, yes."

02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:22.234
TRAVIS: Ooh!

02:38:22.235 --> 02:38:25.074
ASHLEY: How do you know if you're approved?

02:38:25.075 --> 02:38:26.814
MATT: "Walk past it."

02:38:26.815 --> 02:38:28.680
LAURA: Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:38:28.681 --> 02:38:29.778
TRAVIS: Should we have pulled something off

02:38:29.779 --> 02:38:31.964
of one of the corpses in the amphitheater?

02:38:31.965 --> 02:38:33.484
Like a key, or a charm?

02:38:33.485 --> 02:38:35.384
Or a fob?

02:38:35.385 --> 02:38:38.078
LAURA: Do you know the approval protocols?

02:38:39.095 --> 02:38:41.234
MATT: "Usually it's by escorting,

02:38:41.235 --> 02:38:44.658
"if you do not already carry the necessary keys."

02:38:48.235 --> 02:38:49.198
SAM: Are you a key?

02:38:50.295 --> 02:38:51.798
MATT: "I do not believe so."

02:38:52.705 --> 02:38:53.945
TALIESIN: Would you have the authority

02:38:53.946 --> 02:38:56.234
to get us through this?

02:38:56.235 --> 02:38:57.235
MATT: "I do not know.

02:38:57.236 --> 02:38:58.654
"We could try."

02:38:58.655 --> 02:39:00.104
LIAM: What was the layout of that room again?

02:39:00.105 --> 02:39:03.574
As far as further passageways or doors out of it?

02:39:03.575 --> 02:39:05.324
MATT: So it is a mostly rectangular chamber.

02:39:05.325 --> 02:39:07.158
You guys are entering on,

02:39:08.005 --> 02:39:09.624
like, if you're entering from this side,

02:39:09.625 --> 02:39:11.304
it opens a little bit outward,

02:39:11.305 --> 02:39:15.958
and almost widely at an angle across from where you are.

02:39:17.165 --> 02:39:18.395
Like this.
LIAM: Okay.

02:39:19.396 --> 02:39:21.004
MATT: The pillar's in the center of it,

02:39:21.005 --> 02:39:23.534
and across the way, there is one hall that exits,

02:39:23.535 --> 02:39:26.399
and then to the left, there is another hall that exits.

02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:27.704
LIAM: Ah.
TRAVIS: And cross to cross

02:39:27.705 --> 02:39:31.204
is about 80 feet? And the spire-- is that right?

02:39:31.205 --> 02:39:32.684
80 feet from hallway to hallway?

02:39:32.685 --> 02:39:34.254
MATT: About 70 to 80.
TRAVIS: And the spire in the middle

02:39:34.255 --> 02:39:35.624
is also super tall?

02:39:35.625 --> 02:39:36.458
MATT: Correct.

02:39:38.343 --> 02:39:41.175
LIAM: I'm going to bring my globules

02:39:41.176 --> 02:39:43.304
to the edge of the hallway.

02:39:43.305 --> 02:39:46.094
Can I see any dots of red on the ground

02:39:46.095 --> 02:39:48.248
going towards one passage or the other?

02:39:50.005 --> 02:39:51.194
MATT: From where you stand here?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:39:51.195 --> 02:39:52.834
MATT: Make a perception or investigation.

02:39:52.835 --> 02:39:54.735
LIAM: Investigate. I'm just going to peer.

02:39:55.915 --> 02:39:56.748
SAM: (German accent) Peer.

02:39:56.749 --> 02:39:57.971
LIAM: I rolled a one.

02:39:57.972 --> 02:39:59.561
LAURA: (laughs)

02:39:59.562 --> 02:40:02.312
(laughter)

02:40:03.245 --> 02:40:05.264
MATT: You look down for a second,

02:40:05.265 --> 02:40:06.344
and you can't seem to see it.

02:40:06.345 --> 02:40:07.664
As you stand up and look back at your friends,

02:40:07.665 --> 02:40:09.188
Caleb's hair is just--

02:40:10.096 --> 02:40:12.239
(laughter)

02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:13.073
SAM: Silly.

02:40:13.074 --> 02:40:14.657
TRAVIS: Yeah, we don't want to set this thing off.

02:40:14.658 --> 02:40:15.508
LIAM: Fjord.

02:40:15.509 --> 02:40:17.984
TRAVIS: Yes?
LIAM: (poofs)

02:40:17.985 --> 02:40:19.484
Are you able to do that doorway thing

02:40:19.485 --> 02:40:22.311
that we did at Vergesson?

02:40:23.355 --> 02:40:24.921
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, what were you saying?

02:40:24.922 --> 02:40:26.154
I was just caught by your--

02:40:26.155 --> 02:40:28.634
LIAM: Oh, sorry. What is it?

02:40:28.635 --> 02:40:30.235
LAURA: I'm going to draw him in my journal.

02:40:30.236 --> 02:40:34.864
TRAVIS: Your hair and your beard are quite voluptuous.

02:40:34.865 --> 02:40:35.745
TALIESIN: Yahoo Serious.

02:40:35.746 --> 02:40:37.890
SAM: Yeah, I was thinking that same thing.

02:40:37.891 --> 02:40:41.419
LIAM: The thick Zemnian mane, yes.

02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:43.414
That's how it's been referred to in the past.

02:40:43.415 --> 02:40:44.555
I was thinking of--

02:40:44.556 --> 02:40:45.489
TRAVIS: The Arcane Gate.

02:40:45.490 --> 02:40:46.904
LIAM: -- your ability to jump us across,

02:40:46.905 --> 02:40:50.974
but I was hoping to have a good guess at which door to pick.

02:40:50.975 --> 02:40:51.808
TRAVIS: Right.

02:40:52.815 --> 02:40:53.775
Get one.

02:40:53.776 --> 02:40:56.154
I don't think I can move the doorway, I can only rotate it.

02:40:56.155 --> 02:40:58.914
So we would be stuck with whichever one we pick.

02:40:58.915 --> 02:40:59.748
LIAM: Right.

02:40:59.749 --> 02:41:04.748
TRAVIS: Unless maybe Frumpkin wouldn't set off a blast

02:41:05.045 --> 02:41:09.806
of 20d10 damage from this thing.

02:41:09.807 --> 02:41:10.839
LIAM: That is a test, yeah.

02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:11.673
TRAVIS: (poof)

02:41:15.048 --> 02:41:15.890
LIAM: (sighs)

02:41:15.891 --> 02:41:17.314
SAM: So we think if we just walk through there,

02:41:17.315 --> 02:41:19.774
we're going to get zapped with something?

02:41:19.775 --> 02:41:20.914
TRAVIS: Yeah. We don't have any keys.

02:41:20.915 --> 02:41:24.489
LAURA: How far can you go past the orb

02:41:24.490 --> 02:41:26.564
before it attacks you?

02:41:26.565 --> 02:41:28.584
If you don't have approval?

02:41:28.585 --> 02:41:30.824
MATT: "I don't recall,

02:41:30.825 --> 02:41:33.058
"though, it seemed proximity-based."

02:41:34.755 --> 02:41:35.588
LAURA: Hmm.

02:41:37.623 --> 02:41:41.926
LIAM: The column, it's magical, <i>ja</i>?

02:41:43.345 --> 02:41:44.777
MATT: You don't know.

02:41:44.778 --> 02:41:45.611
LIAM: Okay.

02:41:45.612 --> 02:41:47.084
ASHLEY: But Charlie, which way?
MATT: Make an arcana check

02:41:47.085 --> 02:41:49.589
while looking at the construction of it to see.

02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:51.224
LIAM: Yes, I will do that.

02:41:51.225 --> 02:41:54.544
ASHLEY: Did we ask him already? Which way to the--?

02:41:54.545 --> 02:41:56.344
TRAVIS: Oh, we asked him outside. We should ask him again.

02:41:56.345 --> 02:41:58.018
ASHLEY: Yeah. Which way do we go?

02:41:58.995 --> 02:42:00.858
MATT: "I do not recall."

02:42:02.235 --> 02:42:04.174
TRAVIS: To the Genesis Ward?
MATT: "Wait, maybe we

02:42:04.175 --> 02:42:09.061
"we-- we-- we-- we-- we.

02:42:09.062 --> 02:42:10.864
"<i>Oui, oui.</i>"

02:42:10.865 --> 02:42:13.097
ASHLEY: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:42:13.098 --> 02:42:15.884
ASHLEY: I think he's got another language.

02:42:15.885 --> 02:42:17.344
LIAM: Well, he is a protocol droid.
MATT: "I learn quickly."

02:42:17.345 --> 02:42:19.274
TRAVIS: (laughs)
ASHLEY: Oh!

02:42:19.275 --> 02:42:22.074
LIAM: I got a 28 on that arcana check.

02:42:22.075 --> 02:42:23.564
MATT: It does appear to be magical in nature.

02:42:23.565 --> 02:42:26.004
A lot of things in Aeor have some sort of basis

02:42:26.005 --> 02:42:27.764
in long-lasting arcana.

02:42:27.765 --> 02:42:29.518
LIAM: Okay. I have another idea.

02:42:31.685 --> 02:42:33.604
I'm going to try something.

02:42:33.605 --> 02:42:34.605
I might get hurt.

02:42:34.606 --> 02:42:36.728
Please pull me out if I do get hurt.

02:42:36.729 --> 02:42:37.562
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:42:37.563 --> 02:42:39.584
LIAM: I take Allura's staff

02:42:39.585 --> 02:42:43.624
and use it to cast Globe of Invulnerability.

02:42:43.625 --> 02:42:44.605
SAM: Nice.

02:42:44.606 --> 02:42:46.164
MATT: Okay.

02:42:46.165 --> 02:42:50.948
LIAM: And proceed to walk 15 feet into the chamber.

02:42:51.845 --> 02:42:55.694
MATT: Okay. You walk 15 feet into the chamber.

02:42:55.695 --> 02:42:58.965
As you get within about 10 feet

02:43:00.045 --> 02:43:03.078
of the pillar in the center,

02:43:05.015 --> 02:43:08.734
the tower (pulsing, crackles)

02:43:08.735 --> 02:43:10.234
It unleashes this arc,

02:43:10.235 --> 02:43:11.924
this torrent of extremely strong,

02:43:11.925 --> 02:43:13.908
electrical, blue, sparkling energy.

02:43:14.825 --> 02:43:16.964
Hitting the orb, and striking the side,

02:43:16.965 --> 02:43:19.584
and dividing, and sending this wave of sparks

02:43:19.585 --> 02:43:21.534
across the surface

02:43:21.535 --> 02:43:24.594
But not affecting you.
LIAM: Ooh! Hoo!

02:43:24.595 --> 02:43:25.764
I run back.

02:43:25.765 --> 02:43:27.670
I got about 45 seconds.
SAM: Ah!

02:43:27.671 --> 02:43:28.700
LIAM: Let's go to the door on the left.

02:43:28.701 --> 02:43:30.326
SAM: Wait. How many of us can fit with you?

02:43:30.327 --> 02:43:31.217
LIAM: All of you. Let's go.

02:43:31.218 --> 02:43:32.824
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Go, go, go!

02:43:32.825 --> 02:43:35.674
MATT: Okay. As you all excitedly
begin to yell, "Go, go, go!"

02:43:35.675 --> 02:43:37.865
You hear (panting, grunting)

02:43:37.866 --> 02:43:39.194
(roaring)

02:43:39.195 --> 02:43:41.014
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
MATT: From behind where you are

02:43:41.015 --> 02:43:42.734
echo through.
MARISHA: Gotta go!

02:43:42.735 --> 02:43:43.896
MATT: You all go running.
TRAVIS: Run, bitch!

02:43:43.897 --> 02:43:45.462
LIAM: Lure it to the chamber! It'll cook!

02:43:45.463 --> 02:43:47.963
MATT: You guys all run into the middle of the chamber,

02:43:48.894 --> 02:43:51.564
this arcing of energy, blast to the side,

02:43:51.565 --> 02:43:53.565
like half-blinding you as it's hitting.

02:43:53.566 --> 02:43:56.224
You're like, "Oh god!" As you're freaking out,

02:43:56.225 --> 02:43:58.534
it's sparking off to the side.

02:43:58.535 --> 02:44:01.464
You hear the (grunting)

02:44:01.465 --> 02:44:02.904
loudly coming from behind you.

02:44:02.905 --> 02:44:04.890
LIAM: Sex monster!
MATT: Which way are you going?

02:44:04.891 --> 02:44:06.822
TRAVIS: Left! Left, right? Left.
LIAM: Left. I said left.

02:44:06.823 --> 02:44:08.984
I'm running with the staff to the left.

02:44:08.985 --> 02:44:09.841
MATT: You run over to the left.

02:44:09.842 --> 02:44:11.900
You get to the door, and around the corner,

02:44:13.345 --> 02:44:15.704
you see, down on all fours, this massive,

02:44:15.705 --> 02:44:18.254
fleshless, wolf-like creature.

02:44:18.255 --> 02:44:22.634
You see it has this weird, striated, muscle-like structure,

02:44:22.635 --> 02:44:25.714
with this odd red and blue mixture across it.

02:44:25.715 --> 02:44:28.024
It's like the skin has been pulled off and replaced

02:44:28.025 --> 02:44:32.224
with this odd mishmash of various colorations.

02:44:32.225 --> 02:44:33.626
As it turns the corner,

02:44:33.627 --> 02:44:35.034
(snarling) its jaw

02:44:35.035 --> 02:44:37.254
gibbering and drooling out of its teeth,

02:44:37.255 --> 02:44:38.334
arcing upward.

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:41.524
Its eyes, this faintly dull, yellowish glow.

02:44:41.525 --> 02:44:43.686
Its tail whips.

02:44:43.687 --> 02:44:44.734
And at the end of its tail,

02:44:44.735 --> 02:44:46.524
this long, fleshy, spiraling stalk,

02:44:46.525 --> 02:44:48.488
you see a singular, massive eye.

02:44:48.489 --> 02:44:49.836
TRAVIS: Oh!
LAURA: It's the thing! It's the thing!

02:44:49.837 --> 02:44:51.238
It was the thing in the tube!

02:44:51.239 --> 02:44:52.607
LIAM: Yeah. We saw in the other area.
MATT: Indeed.

02:44:52.608 --> 02:44:53.754
MARISHA: Oh!
MATT: I need you guys to

02:44:53.755 --> 02:44:54.588
roll initiative.

02:44:54.589 --> 02:44:56.062
(yelling)

02:44:56.063 --> 02:44:57.070
SAM: Initiative?!

02:44:57.071 --> 02:44:58.284
I thought we were just going to run away!

02:44:58.285 --> 02:44:59.952
TRAVIS: You thought wrong, bitch!

02:44:59.953 --> 02:45:00.960
LIAM: I thought he was describing it

02:45:00.961 --> 02:45:02.549
coming from behind us.

02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:03.690
LAURA: It was!
LIAM: Is it?

02:45:03.691 --> 02:45:05.200
ASHLEY: I think it is.
MARISHA: Wait, is it behind us?

02:45:05.201 --> 02:45:06.034
It is coming from behind us.

02:45:06.035 --> 02:45:07.129
MATT: The sound is coming from behind you.

02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:09.044
SAM: Guys. This sexual combat

02:45:09.045 --> 02:45:11.354
is brought to you by Dwarven Forge,

02:45:11.355 --> 02:45:13.964
makers of premium handcrafted gaming terrain.

02:45:13.965 --> 02:45:15.154
Their April build of the month

02:45:15.155 --> 02:45:17.624
continues the story of Fantasy Gary Gygax,

02:45:17.625 --> 02:45:19.564
searching for his beloved rabbit companion.

02:45:19.565 --> 02:45:23.934
Check it out at bit.ly/dwarvenforgeCR.

02:45:23.935 --> 02:45:24.938
Whoa!

02:45:26.085 --> 02:45:27.074
MATT: Oh no--
SAM: Whoa.

02:45:27.075 --> 02:45:28.332
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:45:29.004 --> 02:45:30.877
LAURA: Cool.

02:45:30.878 --> 02:45:32.045
SAM: Oh, man.

02:45:32.046 --> 02:45:33.595
MARISHA: Okay, we have a Heroes' Feast.

02:45:33.596 --> 02:45:34.429
LAURA: Yes.

02:45:34.430 --> 02:45:35.801
MATT: There it is.
SAM: What does that mean?

02:45:35.802 --> 02:45:37.145
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:45:37.146 --> 02:45:38.016
MATT: All righty.
SAM: How are we going to

02:45:38.016 --> 02:45:38.849
fight this thing?
MARISHA: Wisdom?

02:45:38.849 --> 02:45:39.682
LAURA: I don't know.

02:45:39.683 --> 02:45:41.106
Advantage on wisdom saving throws--
SAM: We have three seconds left.

02:45:41.107 --> 02:45:43.148
LAURA: Immune to poison and immune to fear.
MARISHA: Can we just keep running?

02:45:43.149 --> 02:45:45.075
MATT: You all began to run this way.

02:45:45.076 --> 02:45:47.125
LIAM: Just depends on where they are.
TRAVIS: Where'd we come from?

02:45:47.126 --> 02:45:49.695
MATT: You came through this side,

02:45:49.696 --> 02:45:50.905
and this was across the way,

02:45:50.906 --> 02:45:53.465
and then on the opposite end.
MARISHA: Whoa, that spire.

02:45:53.466 --> 02:45:57.314
MATT: All right. Who is arranged around Caleb?

02:45:57.315 --> 02:45:58.148
TRAVIS: We all are.

02:45:58.149 --> 02:45:59.405
LIAM: Right, so we don't get toasted.

02:45:59.406 --> 02:46:00.897
LAURA: And we're all in this sphere, though.

02:46:00.898 --> 02:46:03.055
TRAVIS: We're all in the Adventures of Babysitting huddle.

02:46:03.056 --> 02:46:05.397
MATT: Is there a particular--

02:46:05.398 --> 02:46:07.039
SAM: Nobody gets off this stage without singing the blues.

02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:08.888
LAURA: I think we're all just as around him as possible.

02:46:08.889 --> 02:46:11.891
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think it's just a clusterfuck.

02:46:11.892 --> 02:46:13.725
MATT: All right, the clusterfuck is--

02:46:13.726 --> 02:46:14.668
MARISHA: Moving cinnamon roll.
MATT: It's as much of a

02:46:14.669 --> 02:46:15.750
clusterfuck as I laid it down.

02:46:15.751 --> 02:46:17.725
Unless you tell me something otherwise, this is where it is.

02:46:17.726 --> 02:46:18.701
TRAVIS and LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: I mean,

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:20.591
you have to be within 10 feet of him, right?

02:46:20.592 --> 02:46:22.492
SAM: Is that big enough? Okay.
LIAM: 10 foot radius.

02:46:22.493 --> 02:46:23.326
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:46:23.327 --> 02:46:25.858
LAURA: We all have to run at the same time. (laughs)

02:46:25.859 --> 02:46:27.565
Oh, it's coming from in front of us?

02:46:27.566 --> 02:46:29.136
MATT: Yeah, that turned the corner from

02:46:29.137 --> 02:46:30.769
the hallway that you were heading towards.

02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:33.515
TRAVIS: Flip me with Essek, so I can be at the back--

02:46:33.516 --> 02:46:34.349
LIAM: A little miscommunication in there.

02:46:34.350 --> 02:46:36.116
TRAVIS: Closest to the enemy that's chasing us.

02:46:36.117 --> 02:46:37.507
MATT: What's that?
TRAVIS: Yeah, flip me with Essek,

02:46:37.508 --> 02:46:39.355
so I can--

02:46:39.356 --> 02:46:41.425
Yeah, Tower Swap back in.
MATT: You got it.

02:46:41.426 --> 02:46:42.530
TALIESIN: How crazy should I--

02:46:42.531 --> 02:46:43.914
Well, we'll find out.

02:46:43.915 --> 02:46:44.856
MATT: As you guys rush through

02:46:44.857 --> 02:46:46.615
and turn towards that hallway.

02:46:46.616 --> 02:46:48.765
The creature you see with the tail

02:46:48.766 --> 02:46:51.915
is coming down the hall on the path you were racing towards

02:46:51.916 --> 02:46:53.875
and turns the corner to face you.

02:46:53.876 --> 02:46:55.975
As you glance over your shoulder where you came--

02:46:55.976 --> 02:46:57.501
SAM: Oh!
MATT: Rounding the corner.

02:46:57.502 --> 02:46:58.933
SAM: Oh, there's another one.
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

02:46:58.934 --> 02:47:00.883
TRAVIS: Oh shit, what is that?!

02:47:00.884 --> 02:47:02.267
MARISHA: He's a different thingy!
LAURA: Oh no.

02:47:02.268 --> 02:47:03.445
MATT: That is--
LAURA: That's the gorilla thing.

02:47:03.446 --> 02:47:06.105
MATT: That is the massive bear-gorilla-like creature

02:47:06.106 --> 02:47:07.932
that you had seen two of them slaughtered.

02:47:07.933 --> 02:47:09.538
LIAM: Bear Grylls is here?

02:47:09.539 --> 02:47:10.995
MARISHA: Bear Grylls is here.

02:47:10.996 --> 02:47:15.665
MATT: Bear Grylls has had a rough year. (laughs)

02:47:15.666 --> 02:47:17.132
MARISHA: Pandemic's been hard on all of us.

02:47:17.133 --> 02:47:19.439
MATT: Indeed. But--
LIAM: Wow.

02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:21.314
SAM: Whoa.
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:47:21.315 --> 02:47:22.623
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness.
LAURA: Please let this dome

02:47:22.624 --> 02:47:23.955
electrocute them both.

02:47:23.956 --> 02:47:25.845
TRAVIS: How long does this globe last?

02:47:25.846 --> 02:47:27.215
LAURA: 45 seconds!
SAM: 10 seconds.

02:47:27.216 --> 02:47:29.655
LIAM: A minute total, so

02:47:29.656 --> 02:47:31.197
there's probably a couple of rounds in it.

02:47:31.198 --> 02:47:32.089
Two or three rounds?

02:47:32.090 --> 02:47:33.815
MARISHA: Should we just keep moving?
SAM: It took him time to go in

02:47:33.816 --> 02:47:35.970
and come back, and for us to come in.

02:47:35.971 --> 02:47:38.568
TRAVIS: We'll need a DM ruling.

02:47:38.569 --> 02:47:42.323
MATT: All right, so I need initiatives, 25 to 20.

02:47:42.324 --> 02:47:43.655
MARISHA: 23.
LAURA: 23.

02:47:43.656 --> 02:47:44.713
MATT: 23, damn!

02:47:44.714 --> 02:47:45.875
TRAVIS: Who has the higher dex?

02:47:45.876 --> 02:47:47.468
LAURA: I bet she-- I have a plus four to dex.

02:47:47.469 --> 02:47:48.509
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:49.885
MARISHA: You have a plus four to dex?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:47:49.886 --> 02:47:51.959
MARISHA: Dang. I'm a plus five, but--

02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:53.355
MATT: 20 to 15.

02:47:53.356 --> 02:47:54.368
ASHLEY: 21.

02:47:54.369 --> 02:47:56.375
MATT: Oh, hell yeah, Yasha.
MARISHA: Ooh!

02:47:56.376 --> 02:47:58.196
LIAM: (beeping)

02:47:59.046 --> 02:48:00.926
MATT: All right.

02:48:00.927 --> 02:48:03.094
LIAM: Oh right, I got a minus for my staff.

02:48:03.095 --> 02:48:04.632
SAM: (triumphant battle trumpet)

02:48:04.633 --> 02:48:07.024
ASHLEY: I don't know why I answered when you said 20 to 15.

02:48:07.025 --> 02:48:07.858
MATT: That's okay.

02:48:07.859 --> 02:48:09.025
MARISHA: I mean, we're going to be resting soon--

02:48:09.026 --> 02:48:10.026
MATT: Anybody else 20 to 15?
MARISHA: -- but also--

02:48:10.026 --> 02:48:10.859
SAM: 14.

02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:12.553
MARISHA: Never know when we're going to--
LIAM: 14.

02:48:12.554 --> 02:48:13.895
TRAVIS: 13.

02:48:13.896 --> 02:48:15.385
TALIESIN: 13.
LIAM: Oh, wow.

02:48:15.386 --> 02:48:17.505
We're all clumped up in the initiative.

02:48:17.506 --> 02:48:18.831
MATT: All right, so we have--

02:48:18.832 --> 02:48:21.081
TRAVIS: Veth, Caleb--
LAURA: Caleb, Fjord.

02:48:21.082 --> 02:48:21.915
TRAVIS: No.

02:48:21.916 --> 02:48:23.255
LIAM: I'm a 14 as well.

02:48:23.256 --> 02:48:25.889
TRAVIS: Caduceus then Fjord, because my dex is zero.

02:48:27.323 --> 02:48:28.156
MATT: All right.

02:48:28.157 --> 02:48:29.955
MARISHA: So Veth, Caleb, Cad, Fjord?

02:48:29.956 --> 02:48:31.088
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:48:31.089 --> 02:48:32.397
MATT: So that's everybody.

02:48:33.586 --> 02:48:34.446
All righty.

02:48:34.447 --> 02:48:36.885
And it is a 10-foot radius, you said?

02:48:36.886 --> 02:48:38.916
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:48:38.917 --> 02:48:42.683
(cheering)

02:48:42.684 --> 02:48:43.917
MARISHA: Wait, what?

02:48:43.918 --> 02:48:45.619
TRAVIS: Bless you!

02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:46.688
MARISHA and TRAVIS: What is that?

02:48:46.689 --> 02:48:48.128
MARISHA: What is it?
LAURA: That's amazing.

02:48:48.129 --> 02:48:50.608
MATT: That is actually the

02:48:50.609 --> 02:48:52.025
Leomund's Tiny Hut.

02:48:52.026 --> 02:48:53.241
LIAM: Oh, is it?

02:48:53.242 --> 02:48:54.377
MATT: Structure for it, I believe.

02:48:54.378 --> 02:48:56.000
MARISHA and ASHLEY: That's so cute!

02:48:56.001 --> 02:48:57.825
LAURA: Is that the size of the dome we always sleep in?

02:48:57.826 --> 02:48:58.696
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: We got the best toys.

02:48:58.696 --> 02:48:59.635
MATT: It's crowded, y'all.

02:48:59.636 --> 02:49:00.676
LAURA: Oh shit.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

02:49:00.677 --> 02:49:01.659
It's a cuddle pile.
LAURA: We are--

02:49:01.660 --> 02:49:03.262
TRAVIS: We've got the best toys.
LAURA: -- <i>on</i> each other.

02:49:03.263 --> 02:49:04.764
SAM: It's a big Dutch oven.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:49:04.765 --> 02:49:05.598
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

02:49:05.598 --> 02:49:06.460
(laughter)

02:49:06.461 --> 02:49:07.780
LAURA: So the Globe of Invulnerability,

02:49:07.781 --> 02:49:09.130
does that protect us against physical?

02:49:09.131 --> 02:49:10.984
TRAVIS: Yasha, stop fucking in the dome!
LIAM: Just magic.

02:49:10.985 --> 02:49:12.765
And it's up to a certain level.
MATT: Beauregard.

02:49:12.766 --> 02:49:14.905
LIAM: Any spell of 5th-level or lower--
MATT: You're up first, Jester--

02:49:14.906 --> 02:49:16.652
LIAM: -- can't get through, higher can.

02:49:16.653 --> 02:49:17.696
MATT: Jester, you're on deck.

02:49:17.697 --> 02:49:19.301
MARISHA: I'm up first.

02:49:19.302 --> 02:49:20.484
I'm up first!

02:49:20.485 --> 02:49:22.637
No, I hate this! Okay.

02:49:22.638 --> 02:49:24.223
TRAVIS: Fuck up the thing in front of you, go get it.

02:49:24.224 --> 02:49:25.648
MARISHA: That's exac-- I'm going to just assume

02:49:25.649 --> 02:49:26.755
that we're going to press on

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:28.295
and I'm going to break rank,

02:49:28.296 --> 02:49:30.837
and I'm going to clear the path in front of us to--

02:49:30.838 --> 02:49:32.187
SAM: You're going to leave the dome?

02:49:32.188 --> 02:49:34.766
MARISHA: I don't know, yeah.

02:49:34.767 --> 02:49:35.853
I don't know what else to do.

02:49:35.854 --> 02:49:36.998
SAM: Yeah, sure.

02:49:36.999 --> 02:49:38.296
MARISHA: I run up and I punch things.

02:49:38.297 --> 02:49:40.585
LIAM: Thanks, guinea pig.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:49:40.586 --> 02:49:41.655
MARISHA: That's all I got.

02:49:41.656 --> 02:49:43.775
MATT: It is likely--
TRAVIS: Or kick. Or elbow.

02:49:43.776 --> 02:49:44.995
MARISHA: Or kick, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:49:44.996 --> 02:49:45.829
MATT: It's probably easier

02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:48.840
to keep this visually situated like that,

02:49:48.841 --> 02:49:49.674
so you guys can move in and out

02:49:49.674 --> 02:49:50.596
without having to worry about that.

02:49:50.596 --> 02:49:51.429
But now that you've seen it, you get

02:49:51.430 --> 02:49:53.207
the sense of how it looks.

02:49:53.208 --> 02:49:54.215
A little more of a bluish tint.

02:49:54.216 --> 02:49:56.245
Whatever coloration you would like, Caleb, but yes--

02:49:56.246 --> 02:49:57.769
LAURA: What Allura would have, right?

02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:58.696
MATT: This Allura's staff,

02:49:58.697 --> 02:50:02.087
so yeah, it would be like a faint grayish-blue coloration.

02:50:02.088 --> 02:50:02.943
LAURA: Ooh.

02:50:02.944 --> 02:50:04.004
MATT: What are you doing, Beauregard?

02:50:04.005 --> 02:50:07.095
MARISHA: I'm going to use

02:50:07.096 --> 02:50:09.345
Yasha and Fjord's shoulders next to me

02:50:09.346 --> 02:50:12.165
to lift myself and propel myself over the group.

02:50:12.166 --> 02:50:16.698
And I'm going to come forward to eyeball-butt.

02:50:16.699 --> 02:50:18.439
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Man. Thing.

02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:19.406
MATT: Right up front, just like that,

02:50:19.407 --> 02:50:20.793
or off to the side? What are you thinking?

02:50:20.794 --> 02:50:23.353
MARISHA: No, right in front of his face.

02:50:23.354 --> 02:50:24.565
MATT: Go for it.

02:50:24.566 --> 02:50:26.325
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to come up

02:50:26.326 --> 02:50:28.905
and I'm going to do a big swinging front kick

02:50:28.906 --> 02:50:30.865
to the front of his face and I'm going to bring my kick

02:50:30.866 --> 02:50:35.866
right back down and do a one-two full-on Thai style.

02:50:36.706 --> 02:50:40.725
Oh god, those are both fives for a 17.

02:50:40.726 --> 02:50:41.578
Both of them.

02:50:41.578 --> 02:50:42.411
MATT: They both hit.

02:50:42.412 --> 02:50:43.675
MARISHA: They both hit, okay.

02:50:43.676 --> 02:50:46.459
Thank goodness gracious, okay.

02:50:47.736 --> 02:50:49.686
And then--

02:50:51.637 --> 02:50:54.355
Okay.

02:50:54.356 --> 02:50:56.445
Sorry, I am using--

02:50:56.446 --> 02:50:57.279
Okay, seven.

02:50:58.116 --> 02:50:59.915
Okay, 14 on the first one.

02:50:59.916 --> 02:51:01.256
MATT: 14 damage, you got it.

02:51:01.257 --> 02:51:02.565
MARISHA: 10 damage on the second one.

02:51:02.566 --> 02:51:04.249
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

02:51:04.250 --> 02:51:06.695
MATT: Stunning Strike on the first strike.

02:51:06.696 --> 02:51:08.295
Natural 17.

02:51:08.296 --> 02:51:09.629
That's a 19 total.

02:51:11.386 --> 02:51:13.715
MARISHA: Natural 17 for a 19 total.

02:51:13.716 --> 02:51:17.405
MATT: Sorry, total of 21.

02:51:17.406 --> 02:51:18.239
My bad.

02:51:20.094 --> 02:51:22.599
MARISHA: You've got pretty good constitution, then.

02:51:26.356 --> 02:51:27.705
Stunning Strike on the second one, too.

02:51:27.706 --> 02:51:28.539
MATT: All righty.

02:51:30.386 --> 02:51:32.595
That is not as good.

02:51:32.596 --> 02:51:34.995
That would be a seven.

02:51:34.996 --> 02:51:35.966
MARISHA: Fail!

02:51:35.967 --> 02:51:38.703
He is stunned!
MATT: Indeed.

02:51:38.704 --> 02:51:41.225
(laughter)

02:51:41.226 --> 02:51:43.755
LIAM: Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy,

02:51:43.756 --> 02:51:45.325
MARISHA: Through the tunnel still.

02:51:45.326 --> 02:51:46.985
MATT: As you rush forth jumping over the rest of them.

02:51:46.986 --> 02:51:48.995
You rush forward and just, boof, boof!

02:51:48.996 --> 02:51:51.175
Slamming with your staff and the second strike you hit it

02:51:51.176 --> 02:51:52.315
right across side of its head.

02:51:52.316 --> 02:51:53.425
As you crack it in the temple,

02:51:53.426 --> 02:51:55.860
you see both of his eyes go dark as they close.

02:51:55.861 --> 02:51:57.457
In the beginning it's like (grunting),

02:51:57.458 --> 02:51:58.765
just shaking its head back and forth.

02:51:58.766 --> 02:52:02.065
It is looking like its having a tough time right now.

02:52:02.066 --> 02:52:04.705
MARISHA: Great, I'm going to go jazz hands, pop pop!

02:52:04.706 --> 02:52:06.825
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: And Flurry of Blows--

02:52:06.826 --> 02:52:08.535
TRAVIS: Cries out in Common, "Mommy!"

02:52:08.536 --> 02:52:09.595
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:52:09.596 --> 02:52:11.395
Ooh, yikes.

02:52:11.396 --> 02:52:15.547
That first one is a 14--

02:52:15.548 --> 02:52:17.645
so 26 on one.

02:52:17.646 --> 02:52:18.479
MATT: All righty.

02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:19.965
MARISHA: And 14 on the second roll, too.

02:52:19.966 --> 02:52:20.864
MATT: Second roll misses,

02:52:20.865 --> 02:52:23.435
first one hits.
MARISHA: Okay, so the first one--

02:52:23.436 --> 02:52:24.675
does damage.

02:52:24.676 --> 02:52:26.115
Ooh, I rolled an eight, though.

02:52:26.116 --> 02:52:27.729
That's good.

02:52:28.586 --> 02:52:31.295
So that is, nope.

02:52:31.296 --> 02:52:32.226
Nope, it's a three.

02:52:32.227 --> 02:52:33.379
It's not an eight.

02:52:34.396 --> 02:52:37.135
10 damage.
MATT: 10 damage, all righty.

02:52:37.136 --> 02:52:38.300
You got it.

02:52:38.301 --> 02:52:39.505
Does that finish your turn?

02:52:39.506 --> 02:52:40.885
MARISHA: Yeah, do I still have enough movement

02:52:40.886 --> 02:52:42.186
to get back into the dome?

02:52:43.426 --> 02:52:44.515
MATT: Yes, you would.

02:52:44.516 --> 02:52:46.345
MARISHA: I will do that because he is stunned.

02:52:46.346 --> 02:52:48.355
So he cannot take reactions.

02:52:48.356 --> 02:52:50.355
MATT: I believe it is the case.

02:52:50.356 --> 02:52:53.010
MARISHA: Okay, and I go back in and I go: I stunned him!

02:52:53.011 --> 02:52:55.125
Ooh, uh, Extract Aspects!

02:52:55.126 --> 02:52:57.644
Because I hit on--
MATT: Indeed.

02:52:57.645 --> 02:53:00.543
Indeed, so after those impacts

02:53:00.544 --> 02:53:01.536
bludgeoning it a third time.

02:53:01.536 --> 02:53:02.536
The fourth one misses.

02:53:02.537 --> 02:53:04.325
But as you dart backward, you take a moment

02:53:04.326 --> 02:53:07.005
to pull that energy back into you.

02:53:07.006 --> 02:53:09.625
It is a very odd physiology to this creature.

02:53:09.626 --> 02:53:12.835
You've never quite felt a physiology like this,

02:53:12.836 --> 02:53:14.205
in some ways it's super intricate.

02:53:14.206 --> 02:53:15.305
In some ways it's super alien.

02:53:15.306 --> 02:53:18.605
In some ways it's very clean and unnatural.

02:53:18.606 --> 02:53:19.506
It's odd.

02:53:19.507 --> 02:53:23.685
But you do sense that it is immune to necrotic

02:53:23.686 --> 02:53:24.915
and radiant damage.

02:53:24.916 --> 02:53:26.335
LAURA: Oh, weird.

02:53:26.336 --> 02:53:27.169
MARISHA: That's good.

02:53:27.170 --> 02:53:31.785
So I come back and I say: Don't use necrotic or holy shit.

02:53:31.786 --> 02:53:33.845
I don't know, it seems--
SAM: Holy shit?

02:53:33.846 --> 02:53:35.952
MARISHA: Well, holy shit!

02:53:35.953 --> 02:53:37.935
It's an alien.
(laughter)

02:53:37.936 --> 02:53:39.543
MATT: That finishes Beau's go.

02:53:39.544 --> 02:53:41.328
Jester, you're up.
LAURA: Okay.

02:53:41.329 --> 02:53:42.717
I don't want to use my spells,

02:53:42.718 --> 02:53:45.376
so I'm going to make a flying leap out of here.

02:53:45.377 --> 02:53:46.480
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:53:46.481 --> 02:53:48.085
LAURA: And I'm going to--
MATT: Where?

02:53:48.086 --> 02:53:50.265
LAURA: Take my hand axe.

02:53:50.266 --> 02:53:52.755
I'm going to run forwards, towards the eyeball tail.

02:53:52.756 --> 02:53:54.510
MATT: Alrighty.
LAURA: And just--

02:53:54.511 --> 02:53:55.489
(grunting)

02:53:55.490 --> 02:53:56.765
MATT: Go for it.
LAURA: Harley Quinn it.

02:53:56.766 --> 02:53:58.125
LIAM: Have fun, Charlie.

02:53:58.126 --> 02:53:59.585
SAM: Yeah.
(laughter)

02:53:59.586 --> 02:54:00.960
SAM: Feel free to kill Sprinkle,

02:54:00.961 --> 02:54:02.626
but don't harm Charlie.
MATT: You have advantage on the attack

02:54:02.627 --> 02:54:04.127
because of Stun, so--

02:54:05.379 --> 02:54:07.419
LAURA: Oh ha ha, 27.

02:54:08.306 --> 02:54:09.845
MATT: 27, all righty.

02:54:09.846 --> 02:54:10.736
That hits.

02:54:10.737 --> 02:54:13.375
LAURA: So I do two additional d8 poison damage

02:54:13.376 --> 02:54:15.356
because of my--
MATT: You do.

02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:18.501
LAURA: Great.

02:54:20.426 --> 02:54:23.636
12 points of damage.

02:54:23.637 --> 02:54:24.621
MATT: 12 points of damage.

02:54:24.622 --> 02:54:26.825
You got it.
LAURA: Seven of those are poison.

02:54:26.826 --> 02:54:29.555
MATT: As you sink your axe into it and pull back,

02:54:29.556 --> 02:54:31.455
you see its blood arc a bit, but behind it,

02:54:31.456 --> 02:54:35.605
there's also a spray of a weird greenish fog.

02:54:35.606 --> 02:54:36.606
As you hit it with the axe,

02:54:36.607 --> 02:54:40.495
you imparted this venomous element of poison to its body

02:54:40.496 --> 02:54:42.545
and pull away, and it-- (shrieking)

02:54:42.546 --> 02:54:45.625
It's shrieking in a weird--

02:54:45.626 --> 02:54:47.125
in some ways you almost feel bad

02:54:47.126 --> 02:54:49.825
because it exhibits dog-like physicality--

02:54:49.826 --> 02:54:51.255
ASHLEY: Oh no.
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:54:51.256 --> 02:54:53.235
MATT: But then the eye blinks in your direction

02:54:53.236 --> 02:54:56.555
with its horrible, pulsing, veiny exterior.

02:54:56.556 --> 02:54:58.225
You're like "This is bad, this is bad."

02:54:58.226 --> 02:55:01.708
LAURA: I'm going to say: here kitty, kitty. (chuckling)

02:55:01.709 --> 02:55:03.302
Doggy, doggy.

02:55:03.303 --> 02:55:04.136
Come on.

02:55:04.137 --> 02:55:06.335
And I'm going to back up and try and get back in the globe.

02:55:06.336 --> 02:55:08.344
MATT: All right, so then--

02:55:12.886 --> 02:55:15.811
You can almost make it into the globe, but not quite.

02:55:15.812 --> 02:55:17.455
LAURA: Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

02:55:17.456 --> 02:55:19.162
MATT: All right, finishing Jester's, go.

02:55:19.163 --> 02:55:19.996
Yasha, you're up.

02:55:19.997 --> 02:55:23.005
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to peep out of the dome

02:55:23.006 --> 02:55:26.719
and also try to attack Mr. Doggy--

02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:28.943
MATT: Over here?
ASHLEY: Kitty, yes.

02:55:28.944 --> 02:55:31.065
TALIESIN: One problem is so much better than two.

02:55:31.066 --> 02:55:32.489
MATT: There you go.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:55:35.149 --> 02:55:38.527
I would like to rage.
TRAVIS: (rage noises)

02:55:38.528 --> 02:55:39.793
MATT: You got it.

02:55:39.794 --> 02:55:41.281
How's that go again?

02:55:41.282 --> 02:55:42.800
ASHLEY: Bah bah bah bah.

02:55:42.801 --> 02:55:43.868
MARISHA: Can't be replicated.

02:55:43.869 --> 02:55:45.950
SAM: (babbley noises)
MARISHA: One of a kind.

02:55:45.951 --> 02:55:47.295
ASHLEY: Running low on these rages.

02:55:47.296 --> 02:55:50.255
Okay, I'm going to take my first swing--

02:55:50.256 --> 02:55:52.025
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: With my Holy Avenger.

02:55:52.026 --> 02:55:53.913
MATT: You have advantage on this because it is stunned.

02:55:53.914 --> 02:55:55.345
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:55:55.346 --> 02:55:56.239
Ooh, okay.

02:55:58.056 --> 02:56:00.425
Okay, 26.

02:56:00.426 --> 02:56:02.185
MATT: That definitely hits.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:56:02.186 --> 02:56:03.019
So--

02:56:05.033 --> 02:56:06.098
SAM: What were those?

02:56:06.099 --> 02:56:08.315
ASHLEY: The little tiniest ball--
SAM: Those are the cutest.

02:56:08.316 --> 02:56:10.400
ASHLEY: I know, they're so cute.
(chuckling)

02:56:10.401 --> 02:56:12.125
MATT: So Yasha,

02:56:12.126 --> 02:56:13.995
just roll your damage dice for your weapon.

02:56:13.996 --> 02:56:15.575
Because the additional damage

02:56:15.576 --> 02:56:17.105
that you'd normally do is radiant.

02:56:17.106 --> 02:56:18.385
It is immune to it.

02:56:18.386 --> 02:56:19.985
ASHLEY: Copy.
MARISHA: Shit.

02:56:19.986 --> 02:56:23.049
ASHLEY: Okay, so got it.

02:56:26.856 --> 02:56:28.645
MATT: So it's just the 2d6, plus your strength,

02:56:28.646 --> 02:56:30.255
plus your weapon modifier.
ASHLEY: Oh, just the 2d6.

02:56:30.256 --> 02:56:31.809
Okay, let me just roll that again.

02:56:32.726 --> 02:56:35.534
Okay, exactly the same.

02:56:38.666 --> 02:56:41.246
Okay, plus that, I think--

02:56:44.426 --> 02:56:46.837
19 points of damage for the first hit.

02:56:46.838 --> 02:56:47.963
MATT: Nice.

02:56:50.536 --> 02:56:51.369
ASHLEY: Second swing?

02:56:52.916 --> 02:56:54.549
MATT: Go for it, second swing.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:56:56.806 --> 02:56:58.325
ASHLEY: Advantage still?
MATT: Yeah.

02:56:58.326 --> 02:57:00.315
Still advantage, still stunned.

02:57:00.316 --> 02:57:02.925
ASHLEY: Ooh, okay, 19?

02:57:02.926 --> 02:57:04.476
MATT: 19 definitely hits.
ASHLEY: Great.

02:57:06.884 --> 02:57:08.599
Ooh!

02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:09.741
MARISHA: It's like dropping diamonds.

02:57:09.742 --> 02:57:11.912
ASHLEY: Double sixes.
MATT: Nice.

02:57:13.014 --> 02:57:13.847
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:57:15.306 --> 02:57:18.066
Yeah, so 15--

02:57:20.186 --> 02:57:21.136
MATT: Plus your weapon.

02:57:21.137 --> 02:57:22.729
ASHLEY: 15.

02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:23.788
18.

02:57:23.789 --> 02:57:24.927
MATT: 18.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:57:24.928 --> 02:57:26.835
(laughter)

02:57:26.836 --> 02:57:29.345
MARISHA: You're just the cutest. (laughter)

02:57:29.346 --> 02:57:31.563
ASHLEY: I'm bad at counting.

02:57:31.564 --> 02:57:32.995
Okay.

02:57:32.996 --> 02:57:34.265
MATT: All righty.
ASHLEY: Math.

02:57:34.266 --> 02:57:36.009
MATT: All right, that finish your turn?

02:57:36.010 --> 02:57:36.843
You still have movement if you want

02:57:36.844 --> 02:57:39.265
to try and shift a little bit, up to you.

02:57:39.266 --> 02:57:40.156
ASHLEY: Nah.

02:57:40.157 --> 02:57:41.295
MATT: Good on you.

02:57:41.296 --> 02:57:43.404
All right, Yasha, your turn's done.

02:57:43.405 --> 02:57:44.932
MATT: It is now--
ASHLEY: Might be dumb.

02:57:44.933 --> 02:57:47.975
MATT: -- this fellow's turn.
TRAVIS: Which one, eye-stalk?

02:57:47.976 --> 02:57:48.809
SAM: Or sex creature?

02:57:48.810 --> 02:57:50.586
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:57:50.587 --> 02:57:52.061
MATT: This creature--
ASHLEY: Sex Bob-Omb.

02:57:52.062 --> 02:57:53.270
LIAM: Sex beast.

02:57:54.416 --> 02:57:56.686
MARISHA: Where are the Sex Bob-Ombs?

02:57:56.687 --> 02:57:58.225
LAURA: (laughs) We're gonna fuck shit up!

02:57:58.226 --> 02:57:59.435
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

02:57:59.436 --> 02:58:01.783
MATT: You can see, as it runs along on the ground

02:58:01.784 --> 02:58:05.385
it uses its longer, stronger front arms

02:58:05.386 --> 02:58:06.685
to like pull itself forward,

02:58:06.686 --> 02:58:09.025
much like a gorilla with its lower legs tearing in.

02:58:09.026 --> 02:58:11.235
And as it rushes over it-- (swish)

02:58:11.236 --> 02:58:14.935
Has these massive jagged claws out and-- (growling)

02:58:14.936 --> 02:58:16.903
Now arcs forward with both--
LAURA: Oh no.

02:58:16.904 --> 02:58:18.045
No!

02:58:18.046 --> 02:58:20.555
MATT: I'm going to say both towards
you, Fjord, at the moment.

02:58:20.556 --> 02:58:21.614
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:58:23.166 --> 02:58:24.299
Sword's out.

02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:29.385
MATT: That is going to be a 19 to hit.

02:58:29.386 --> 02:58:32.035
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:58:32.036 --> 02:58:35.385
MATT: All righty, and the other is 26 to hit.

02:58:35.386 --> 02:58:36.745
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

02:58:36.746 --> 02:58:38.566
MATT: All right, so you take--

02:58:45.086 --> 02:58:47.009
Nine points of piercing damage.

02:58:49.216 --> 02:58:53.025
Plus seven points of force damage from one strike.

02:58:53.026 --> 02:58:54.525
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: As its claw hits you.

02:58:54.526 --> 02:58:57.205
And as it hits you, it cuts.

02:58:57.206 --> 02:58:59.525
And then there's this like burst within the claw,

02:58:59.526 --> 02:59:02.185
almost like there's this sudden shattering

02:59:02.186 --> 02:59:04.085
of some sort of magical aura,

02:59:04.086 --> 02:59:05.965
that continues to cut through you,

02:59:05.966 --> 02:59:07.685
beyond what the claw hits.

02:59:07.686 --> 02:59:09.115
As you like, pull back

02:59:09.116 --> 02:59:10.785
the other claw, gets you from behind

02:59:10.786 --> 02:59:12.393
and you take--
MARISHA: (whispers) What?

02:59:12.394 --> 02:59:13.227
MATT: That's cocked.

02:59:13.228 --> 02:59:15.915
LAURA: I don't like this creature.
MARISHA: Uh-uh.

02:59:15.916 --> 02:59:17.728
MATT: Nine points of--

02:59:19.886 --> 02:59:23.225
sorry, that's slashing damage on both of them.

02:59:23.226 --> 02:59:26.375
So that's nine points of slashing damage.

02:59:26.376 --> 02:59:27.879
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: And then--

02:59:30.736 --> 02:59:32.955
10 points of force damage on the other strike.

02:59:32.956 --> 02:59:34.135
TRAVIS: Damn.

02:59:34.136 --> 02:59:36.015
MATT: So you like-- (impacts)

02:59:36.016 --> 02:59:37.245
grab on both sides.

02:59:37.246 --> 02:59:39.875
And as you recoil from the side, you turn, Caduceus.

02:59:39.876 --> 02:59:43.125
And as it finishes slashing into Fjord, it turns to you

02:59:43.126 --> 02:59:45.079
and-- (growling) it's going to go ahead

02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:46.524
and attempt to bite towards your face.

02:59:46.525 --> 02:59:48.099
TRAVIS: That's 35 points, man.

02:59:48.100 --> 02:59:50.015
MATT: Ooh!
SAM: Not the money maker.

02:59:50.016 --> 02:59:51.923
MATT: 27 to hit.

02:59:51.924 --> 02:59:53.394
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, it hits.

02:59:53.395 --> 02:59:54.228
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:59:54.229 --> 02:59:57.365
LIAM: That Telekinetic Watermelon
Bear is not fucking around.

02:59:57.366 --> 02:59:58.935
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage.

02:59:58.936 --> 03:00:00.745
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

03:00:00.746 --> 03:00:03.053
MATT: And 10 points of force damage--

03:00:03.054 --> 03:00:04.046
TALIESIN: Ooh.
LIAM: Oh.

03:00:04.047 --> 03:00:08.225
MATT: To your face, as it bites down and as it chomps,

03:00:08.226 --> 03:00:11.055
it releases you as the same sort of,

03:00:11.056 --> 03:00:13.708
almost like an air bullet from each one of its teeth,

03:00:13.709 --> 03:00:16.299
blast into your face and you pull away.

03:00:16.300 --> 03:00:18.065
As Caduceus rears back

03:00:18.066 --> 03:00:20.455
and makes an instinctual pain sound,

03:00:20.456 --> 03:00:23.435
you see a spray of Caduceus' blood through the air.

03:00:23.436 --> 03:00:25.645
TRAVIS: On the two strikes against me,

03:00:25.646 --> 03:00:29.365
it takes a combined 16 points of radiant damage--

03:00:29.366 --> 03:00:30.795
LAURA: Oh, but it's immune to radiant damage--

03:00:30.796 --> 03:00:31.629
TRAVIS: Not.
LAURA: No--

03:00:31.630 --> 03:00:32.745
TRAVIS: We don't know, it might be.

03:00:32.746 --> 03:00:35.935
MATT: As it blasts, it doesn't even react.

03:00:35.936 --> 03:00:38.495
TRAVIS: Awesome, I will use the reaction

03:00:38.496 --> 03:00:42.315
to teleport 10 feet to the opposite side of it.

03:00:42.316 --> 03:00:43.149
MATT: All righty.

03:00:43.150 --> 03:00:44.798
TRAVIS: Put my back against the wall.

03:00:44.799 --> 03:00:46.195
LAURA: Oh no, but you're out of the Globe.

03:00:46.196 --> 03:00:48.215
TRAVIS: 10 feet radius--
MARISHA: To beat, yeah.

03:00:48.216 --> 03:00:49.049
LAURA: Of the Globe?

03:00:49.050 --> 03:00:51.055
TRAVIS: Yeah, it didn't get hit.

03:00:51.056 --> 03:00:53.715
SAM: Wait, what?
LAURA: It hasn't gone off yet.

03:00:53.716 --> 03:00:55.266
MATT: Not yet, you haven't seen it.

03:00:56.758 --> 03:00:58.055
MARISHA: Okay.

03:00:58.056 --> 03:00:59.525
MATT: That finishes its turn.

03:00:59.526 --> 03:01:00.366
Veth, you're up.

03:01:00.367 --> 03:01:01.466
Caleb, you're on deck.

03:01:03.416 --> 03:01:05.495
SAM: I would like to shoot the one that's stunned

03:01:05.496 --> 03:01:06.329
in front of us.

03:01:06.330 --> 03:01:11.055
I know that this sex monster's menacing us from the side.

03:01:11.056 --> 03:01:15.225
But I feel like that one's almost closer to death.

03:01:15.226 --> 03:01:17.375
So I'm going to try to take out the stunned one.

03:01:17.376 --> 03:01:19.825
MATT: Sure, you have advantage on the strike.

03:01:19.826 --> 03:01:22.659
SAM: Okay, 22 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

03:01:27.155 --> 03:01:32.155
SAM: 12, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27.

03:01:33.046 --> 03:01:37.094
33 points on the first one.
MATT: Ooh, nice!

03:01:39.566 --> 03:01:42.515
SAM: And the second, I will bonus action also shoot,

03:01:42.516 --> 03:01:44.415
this time with Sharpshooter.

03:01:44.416 --> 03:01:45.566
MATT: Hell yeah, go for it.

03:01:50.516 --> 03:01:52.439
SAM: 24 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

03:01:53.999 --> 03:01:56.705
SAM: And that's eight plus 10.

03:01:56.706 --> 03:01:58.355
So 18 points.

03:01:58.356 --> 03:01:59.697
MATT: 18 points, nice.

03:02:02.116 --> 03:02:02.949
As you're all shooting it

03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:05.295
and Yasha is up against it, slashing into it,

03:02:05.296 --> 03:02:08.755
the creature is starting to show some serious wear and tear,

03:02:08.756 --> 03:02:09.855
it's starting to bleed onto the ground.

03:02:09.856 --> 03:02:12.265
As it is trying to regain its senses

03:02:12.266 --> 03:02:14.865
after being thoroughly stunned and beaten by Beauregard,

03:02:14.866 --> 03:02:17.766
it's thrashing and splattering the wall with its own gore.

03:02:19.446 --> 03:02:21.475
You're going to stay put?

03:02:21.476 --> 03:02:24.015
SAM: I don't want to leave this space.

03:02:24.016 --> 03:02:26.275
Can I stay in the dome, but sort of crouched

03:02:26.276 --> 03:02:29.269
behind that little, tiny pedestal in front of me?

03:02:30.636 --> 03:02:32.325
MATT: You would be leaving the dome

03:02:32.326 --> 03:02:33.575
if you were to go behind this pedestal,

03:02:33.576 --> 03:02:34.895
unless you want to go on this side.

03:02:34.896 --> 03:02:37.995
SAM: Yeah, staying in the dome, but sort of like--

03:02:37.996 --> 03:02:38.829
oh, I see.

03:02:38.830 --> 03:02:40.255
Oh, I can't go to the other side of it?

03:02:40.256 --> 03:02:42.496
MATT: Other side, you will technically
be outside of the dome.

03:02:42.497 --> 03:02:45.005
SAM: (frustrated noise) Then I will--

03:02:45.006 --> 03:02:46.928
Who's next to me? Fjord?

03:02:46.929 --> 03:02:48.505
MATT: There's Beauregard right there.

03:02:48.506 --> 03:02:51.475
SAM: I will hide behind Beauregard.

03:02:51.476 --> 03:02:52.396
MATT: Right there?

03:02:52.396 --> 03:02:53.306
SAM: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

03:02:53.307 --> 03:02:55.185
SAM: Oh wait, I'm sorry, well, no.

03:02:55.186 --> 03:02:56.315
I think that--

03:02:56.316 --> 03:02:58.785
The thing-- this creature's stunned in front of us

03:02:58.786 --> 03:02:59.945
with the eyeball thing--
MATT: Yeah.

03:02:59.946 --> 03:03:01.695
SAM: I feel like they're going to shoot a beam at us.

03:03:01.696 --> 03:03:03.865
So I want to be behind Beauregard.

03:03:03.866 --> 03:03:05.871
MATT: Okay, so like here?
SAM: Yeah.

03:03:05.872 --> 03:03:06.925
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Beauregard--

03:03:06.926 --> 03:03:08.005
So right back to where you were?

03:03:08.006 --> 03:03:10.425
SAM: Yeah, sorry, I can't see.
(laughter)

03:03:10.426 --> 03:03:11.505
LIAM: You're using the halfling trait, right?

03:03:11.506 --> 03:03:12.785
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Of hiding behind the--

03:03:12.786 --> 03:03:15.505
MATT: All right, so you're behind there.

03:03:15.506 --> 03:03:16.825
You use your bonus action to attack,

03:03:16.826 --> 03:03:18.072
so you cannot actually hide.

03:03:18.073 --> 03:03:19.705
SAM: I'll just huddle.

03:03:19.706 --> 03:03:23.609
MATT: Okay, you are huddled behind,
loosely, nearish to Beau.

03:03:25.256 --> 03:03:26.256
You got it.

03:03:30.526 --> 03:03:32.555
And oh, I accidentally--

03:03:32.556 --> 03:03:34.255
haha, that's funny.

03:03:34.256 --> 03:03:36.465
SAM: Who's that?
MATT: That is technically,

03:03:36.466 --> 03:03:39.660
your echo that I somehow threw on there accidentally.

03:03:39.661 --> 03:03:40.626
LAURA: (laughs)

03:03:40.627 --> 03:03:41.875
So you can actually--

03:03:41.876 --> 03:03:42.963
LAURA: Was that supposed to be Charlie?

03:03:42.964 --> 03:03:44.125
Oh, I think that was Charlie.

03:03:44.126 --> 03:03:45.385
MATT: I was using as Charlie.

03:03:45.386 --> 03:03:46.718
We're just saying Charlie's on your back.

03:03:46.719 --> 03:03:48.465
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: For the purposes of this.

03:03:48.466 --> 03:03:50.625
SAM: Are Charlie and Sprinkle having a conversation?

03:03:50.626 --> 03:03:51.459
LAURA: They are--

03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:53.417
well, Sprinkle's just screeching at him.

03:03:53.418 --> 03:03:55.460
MATT: Yep. (screeches)

03:03:55.461 --> 03:03:57.215
All right, that finishes your go.
LAURA: Maybe Charlie can understand him.

03:03:57.216 --> 03:03:58.136
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:03:58.136 --> 03:03:58.969
Caleb, you're up.

03:03:58.970 --> 03:04:01.183
ASHLEY: Maybe Charlie can speak--

03:04:01.184 --> 03:04:02.716
LAURA: Weasel!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:04:02.717 --> 03:04:03.874
LIAM: So I'm not going to move,

03:04:03.875 --> 03:04:06.545
because I don't want to pull the staff off of anyone.

03:04:06.546 --> 03:04:11.435
I'm just going to drag the dust along my arm

03:04:11.436 --> 03:04:13.545
and almost point-blank range,

03:04:13.546 --> 03:04:17.715
shoot the Disintegrate ray into the green meanie's face.

03:04:17.716 --> 03:04:18.919
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:04:21.026 --> 03:04:23.750
LIAM: So that's a dex save on their part, yeah?

03:04:23.751 --> 03:04:25.365
MATT: A dex save!

03:04:25.366 --> 03:04:26.199
Got it.

03:04:30.456 --> 03:04:32.796
MATT: It does have advantage on this.

03:04:32.797 --> 03:04:34.412
Natural 19.

03:04:34.413 --> 03:04:36.114
LIAM: Oh, so yeah, saved.
MATT: It saves.

03:04:36.115 --> 03:04:38.945
LIAM: Yeah, goes over shoulder, that's fine.

03:04:38.946 --> 03:04:40.075
MATT: You turn towards it and aim.

03:04:40.076 --> 03:04:43.705
It gets low and just arcs off,

03:04:43.706 --> 03:04:45.195
hits the stone wall behind it.

03:04:45.196 --> 03:04:49.280
And, (swish) it is gone.

03:04:49.281 --> 03:04:50.415
Fjord, as you're standing there

03:04:50.416 --> 03:04:52.845
suddenly you're leaning back

03:04:52.846 --> 03:04:54.894
and you hear this (swish) sound

03:04:54.895 --> 03:04:56.275
and you glance over your shoulder.

03:04:56.276 --> 03:04:58.535
And there's just a vacuous hole in the wall behind you

03:04:58.536 --> 03:05:00.940
and a pit about 10 feet below where you were standing,

03:05:00.941 --> 03:05:03.075
and your heels are just on the edge.

03:05:04.810 --> 03:05:06.436
LIAM: So that thing is fast.

03:05:07.536 --> 03:05:08.605
MATT: All right.

03:05:08.606 --> 03:05:09.875
Staying put Caleb?

03:05:09.876 --> 03:05:12.695
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not going to take that bubble off of anyone.

03:05:12.696 --> 03:05:13.865
MATT: All righty, no worries.

03:05:13.866 --> 03:05:16.515
All right, finishing Caleb's go. It is now Caduceus.

03:05:16.516 --> 03:05:17.908
Fjord, you're on deck.

03:05:19.566 --> 03:05:21.525
TALIESIN: Just because we have too many problems right now

03:05:21.526 --> 03:05:23.195
and I got what you were trying to do.

03:05:23.196 --> 03:05:25.685
I'm going to try Banishment on this thing.

03:05:25.686 --> 03:05:27.455
MATT: On the green one?
TALIESIN: On the green one.

03:05:27.456 --> 03:05:28.289
MATT: All righty.

03:05:29.444 --> 03:05:30.426
That is a wisdom save?

03:05:30.427 --> 03:05:34.615
TALIESIN: That is a-- actually, a charisma save.

03:05:34.616 --> 03:05:35.669
MATT: Charisma, got it.

03:05:36.736 --> 03:05:40.251
With advantage on that.

03:05:40.252 --> 03:05:41.492
Natural 20.

03:05:41.493 --> 03:05:42.795
LIAM: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Fucking fuck.

03:05:42.796 --> 03:05:44.499
TRAVIS: Wow.
MARISHA: Ooh.

03:05:45.955 --> 03:05:47.337
MATT: (sighs)

03:05:47.338 --> 03:05:48.603
Sorry, buddy.

03:05:48.604 --> 03:05:50.560
LIAM: Just can't compete with its sexual energy.

03:05:50.561 --> 03:05:52.160
MARISHA: I know.
MATT: Right?

03:05:52.161 --> 03:05:54.125
MARISHA: Look at his little, like Speedo he's wearing.

03:05:54.126 --> 03:05:55.910
LAURA: Yeah, I know he's wearing--

03:05:55.911 --> 03:05:57.244
TALIESIN: Well, I'm a little fucked next round.

03:05:57.245 --> 03:05:59.011
MARISHA: He came to party.
TALIESIN: Shit!

03:05:59.012 --> 03:06:01.176
(laughter)
TRAVIS: "He came to party."

03:06:01.177 --> 03:06:03.910
(laughter)

03:06:03.911 --> 03:06:06.263
LAURA: Pretty sure those are leather.

03:06:06.264 --> 03:06:07.525
TRAVIS: He saw the dancing, and he was like--

03:06:07.526 --> 03:06:09.504
LIAM: Yeah, play the Right Said Fred music.

03:06:09.505 --> 03:06:11.738
(laughter)

03:06:11.739 --> 03:06:14.086
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the last of my--

03:06:15.726 --> 03:06:20.726
my moment to just do a Hidden Step and see if that helps.

03:06:20.816 --> 03:06:22.385
So I'm turning invisible.

03:06:22.386 --> 03:06:24.659
MATT: Okay, so you are--

03:06:24.660 --> 03:06:26.226
MARISHA: He doesn't have sex organs--

03:06:26.227 --> 03:06:27.825
TALIESIN: Actually--
MARISHA: --and we're just like, meh.

03:06:27.826 --> 03:06:29.302
I'm invisible.
LIAM: Got a Speedo.

03:06:29.303 --> 03:06:30.136
MATT: Yeah?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:06:30.137 --> 03:06:33.145
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and make a break for it.

03:06:33.146 --> 03:06:35.146
I'm going to go to the other side of the--

03:06:36.519 --> 03:06:37.352
MATT: Of the dome?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:06:37.353 --> 03:06:38.451
LIAM: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: There.

03:06:38.452 --> 03:06:39.285
MATT: It does not see you.

03:06:39.286 --> 03:06:41.585
Does not get to take a reaction on you, you're fine.

03:06:41.586 --> 03:06:43.215
ASHLEY: Nice, nice.

03:06:43.216 --> 03:06:44.186
MATT: That finish your go?

03:06:44.187 --> 03:06:46.016
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

03:06:46.880 --> 03:06:48.913
TRAVIS: Right, well,

03:06:49.905 --> 03:06:51.270
there's a (mumbling)

03:06:51.271 --> 03:06:52.715
a hole behind me now.

03:06:52.716 --> 03:06:54.031
I'm going to...

03:06:54.032 --> 03:06:55.564
(random noises)

03:06:55.565 --> 03:06:58.056
cast Thunder Step

03:06:59.186 --> 03:07:01.255
and get the fuck out of here.

03:07:01.256 --> 03:07:03.555
Just in case I was wrong about this thing going off

03:07:03.556 --> 03:07:06.705
and I'm going to take a knee and poof!

03:07:06.706 --> 03:07:09.218
Explode and go in this direction over here.

03:07:09.219 --> 03:07:10.144
MATT: All right.

03:07:10.145 --> 03:07:12.875
(swoosh) (poof)

03:07:12.876 --> 03:07:16.265
TRAVIS: And that is 5d10 thunder damage.

03:07:16.266 --> 03:07:17.340
LAURA: Whoa.
MARISHA: Nice.

03:07:17.341 --> 03:07:19.273
LAURA: Thunder, thunder, thunder.

03:07:19.274 --> 03:07:20.955
MATT: Is that a dex save for them?

03:07:20.956 --> 03:07:23.214
TRAVIS: Yes, constitution.

03:07:23.215 --> 03:07:25.494
MATT: Oh, constitution, good to know.
LAURA: Thunder, thunder.

03:07:25.495 --> 03:07:28.255
LAURA: Thunder damage!
(laughter)

03:07:28.256 --> 03:07:29.625
MATT: 17?

03:07:29.626 --> 03:07:30.459
TRAVIS: 18.

03:07:30.460 --> 03:07:32.404
MATT: So it does not save.

03:07:32.405 --> 03:07:35.295
TRAVIS: And it is 36 points of thunder damage.

03:07:35.296 --> 03:07:36.209
MATT: Nice.

03:07:38.556 --> 03:07:39.389
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:07:39.390 --> 03:07:43.365
MATT: As you slam the sword downward and-- (blast)

03:07:43.366 --> 03:07:45.325
The heavy sound echoes through the chamber

03:07:45.326 --> 03:07:48.135
and now the halls around you shaking like bits of stone

03:07:48.136 --> 03:07:49.785
and dust from the ceiling above.

03:07:49.786 --> 03:07:51.935
And the creature-- (grunts)

03:07:51.936 --> 03:07:54.685
gets blown partially forward, catches itself

03:07:54.686 --> 03:07:56.995
and you can't see the back of it,

03:07:56.996 --> 03:07:58.941
but it looks like it took the full brunt of that.

03:07:58.942 --> 03:08:00.495
As you, (swish) appear to the other side,

03:08:00.496 --> 03:08:02.225
showing the hall that you're standing in now

03:08:02.226 --> 03:08:03.445
curving to the left.

03:08:03.446 --> 03:08:06.832
TRAVIS: Is there anything I can
just see in my immediate landing?

03:08:11.636 --> 03:08:12.751
MATT: Down this way?

03:08:12.752 --> 03:08:14.725
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: The hall continues.

03:08:14.726 --> 03:08:17.250
TRAVIS: Just a hallway, okay.

03:08:17.251 --> 03:08:19.498
LAURA: Oh, it just (swoosh) and it comes back together?

03:08:19.499 --> 03:08:20.940
MATT: And racing down this way--

03:08:20.941 --> 03:08:22.114
TRAVIS: Cool.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

03:08:22.115 --> 03:08:25.415
MATT: Called by the sound of the chaos, it looks like a--

03:08:25.416 --> 03:08:27.598
TRAVIS: Not the thunder, just the chaos.
MATT: Yeah.

03:08:27.599 --> 03:08:30.065
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:08:30.066 --> 03:08:33.432
MATT: It now has more reasons to be excited.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:08:33.433 --> 03:08:35.685
MATT: But another one of these
creatures is (rapid stomping sounds)

03:08:35.686 --> 03:08:36.845
this panther-like entity

03:08:36.846 --> 03:08:38.905
is just charging in the direction where you're coming.

03:08:38.906 --> 03:08:41.205
TRAVIS: Panther-like, not gorilla?
LAURA: The eyeball one.

03:08:41.206 --> 03:08:42.722
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Okay, Cat-Dog.

03:08:45.169 --> 03:08:46.895
MATT: Up there.
TRAVIS: Good, good, good, good.

03:08:46.896 --> 03:08:48.705
LAURA: I forget what this creature was called.

03:08:48.706 --> 03:08:51.875
It was called something in the test tubes.

03:08:51.876 --> 03:08:53.055
You would remember.

03:08:53.056 --> 03:08:54.714
LIAM: If that was within a month.

03:08:54.715 --> 03:08:58.185
MATT: That was an Aeorian Absorber.

03:08:58.186 --> 03:09:00.835
SAM: Absorber.
MARISHA: Absorber.

03:09:00.836 --> 03:09:01.669
TALIESIN: I don't like that.

03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:03.601
MATT: That finish your turn?
ASHLEY: I don't like that at all.

03:09:03.602 --> 03:09:05.756
LIAM: Do you go in its eye?

03:09:05.757 --> 03:09:07.695
TALIESIN: You've got movement.

03:09:07.696 --> 03:09:08.529
TRAVIS: I do have movement--

03:09:08.530 --> 03:09:09.789
MATT: Yeah, because you have not moved yet.

03:09:11.963 --> 03:09:13.396
TRAVIS: I'll just come to the--

03:09:14.546 --> 03:09:16.325
Mother bitch, I'll just come right here,

03:09:16.326 --> 03:09:17.982
so I'm at the lip of the hallway.

03:09:17.983 --> 03:09:19.213
I want to get five more feet out of it.

03:09:19.214 --> 03:09:20.965
MATT: Right here?
TRAVIS: No, closer to you.

03:09:20.966 --> 03:09:22.480
I'm sorry to your left, sorry.

03:09:22.481 --> 03:09:24.015
TALIESIN: You're okay getting hit by the--

03:09:24.016 --> 03:09:24.849
MATT: You got it.

03:09:24.850 --> 03:09:25.977
TRAVIS: I don't think I'll get hit in there, though.

03:09:25.978 --> 03:09:27.789
MATT: So you back up a little bit.

03:09:29.096 --> 03:09:30.685
All right.
SAM: No one's gotten hit yet.

03:09:30.686 --> 03:09:32.418
I think it's fine.
MATT: That finishes Fjord's go.

03:09:32.419 --> 03:09:33.935
It's that first absorber's turn.

03:09:33.936 --> 03:09:35.733
He is stunned, cannot take his turn

03:09:35.734 --> 03:09:37.275
until the end of Beauregard's go.

03:09:37.276 --> 03:09:38.805
Beau, you're up first.
MARISHA: Ooh.

03:09:38.806 --> 03:09:40.987
MATT: Top of the round, what are you doing?

03:09:40.988 --> 03:09:42.345
MARISHA: So wait, absorber.

03:09:42.346 --> 03:09:45.275
Okay, I'm just going to try and finish this guy off

03:09:45.276 --> 03:09:46.109
in front of me.

03:09:46.110 --> 03:09:49.325
So I'm going to dart forward again, past Yasha.

03:09:49.326 --> 03:09:51.665
Come in for another round against this absorber.

03:09:51.666 --> 03:09:53.055
ASHLEY: Gonna make room for her.

03:09:53.056 --> 03:09:54.855
MARISHA: Thank you.
MATT: You got it.

03:09:54.856 --> 03:09:58.914
MARISHA: I give a little tap on
the side, while I pass Yasha.

03:09:58.915 --> 03:10:00.495
MATT: Advantage on your strikes.

03:10:00.496 --> 03:10:02.025
MARISHA: Advantage, oh right.

03:10:02.026 --> 03:10:03.605
MATT: He's stunned, don't forget.
MARISHA: Well, okay.

03:10:03.606 --> 03:10:05.608
Well, that's a 19 and a 17, so that is--

03:10:05.609 --> 03:10:06.649
MATT: That definitely hits.

03:10:06.650 --> 03:10:08.505
MARISHA: Definitely hits on that first one.

03:10:08.506 --> 03:10:12.255
Second attack, also another natural 19 and a seven.

03:10:12.256 --> 03:10:14.372
So I'll take that 19.
MATT: Yeah, so first two hits.

03:10:14.373 --> 03:10:15.616
TRAVIS: Take that, take that, take that.

03:10:15.617 --> 03:10:16.450
MATT: Hit.
MARISHA: Hey-oh.

03:10:16.451 --> 03:10:17.865
Yeah, that's good.

03:10:17.866 --> 03:10:22.465
Okay, that first attack is going to be 10 damage total.

03:10:22.466 --> 03:10:24.359
And the second one is 13 damage.

03:10:26.016 --> 03:10:28.259
MATT: Second one was 13 damage, got it.

03:10:28.260 --> 03:10:30.822
MARISHA: So 23 together.

03:10:30.823 --> 03:10:32.900
MATT: All right, actually this guy would've--

03:10:32.901 --> 03:10:34.155
I'll tell you this at the end of your turn,

03:10:34.156 --> 03:10:34.989
because it won't matter--

03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:36.765
MARISHA: And I will go ahead and Stunning Strike it again,

03:10:36.766 --> 03:10:37.736
if it's not dead.

03:10:37.737 --> 03:10:39.813
MATT: All right, it is not dead.
MARISHA: It's not dead.

03:10:39.814 --> 03:10:41.553
Stunning Strike.

03:10:41.554 --> 03:10:44.025
MATT: That is a 14.

03:10:44.026 --> 03:10:46.285
MARISHA: He is stunned again!
MATT: Stunned again.

03:10:46.286 --> 03:10:48.485
That guy has done nothing this fight.

03:10:48.486 --> 03:10:51.097
MARISHA: Ha ha ha ha, I feel like a monk again!

03:10:51.098 --> 03:10:52.774
TRAVIS: --it's on the other side of the map,

03:10:52.775 --> 03:10:53.865
we don't know what they do.
MATT: All right.

03:10:53.866 --> 03:10:55.915
MARISHA: No--
MATT: You have your bonus action, still.

03:10:55.916 --> 03:10:57.655
MARISHA: Bonus action, might as well--

03:10:57.656 --> 03:11:00.275
I'm going to just try and burn this
thing down. Flurry of Blows.

03:11:00.276 --> 03:11:01.765
Still advantage, right?

03:11:01.766 --> 03:11:02.666
MATT: Yep, because it's still stunned.

03:11:02.667 --> 03:11:04.787
MARISHA: Natural 20!
TRAVIS: Yes!

03:11:04.788 --> 03:11:05.862
MARISHA: 20 and a two!

03:11:05.863 --> 03:11:07.604
TRAVIS: Get it bitch!
MARISHA: Take that!

03:11:09.203 --> 03:11:11.495
Okay, and that second one, it hits.

03:11:11.496 --> 03:11:15.195
But it's not a natural 20, with a 25.

03:11:15.196 --> 03:11:16.629
MATT: Yep that hits, roll damage on each.

03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:17.965
MARISHA: Okay, so--
MATT: Crit first.

03:11:17.966 --> 03:11:19.305
MARISHA: So, first one is double the dice.

03:11:19.306 --> 03:11:20.922
Come on, give me something good.

03:11:20.923 --> 03:11:22.805
Woo, woo, they're all eight!

03:11:22.806 --> 03:11:27.072
Okay, so eight, 16, plus another seven is...

03:11:27.073 --> 03:11:28.942
LIAM: 23.
MARISHA: 23!

03:11:28.943 --> 03:11:29.776
MATT: All righty.

03:11:29.777 --> 03:11:33.754
MARISHA: And then second damage is 10.

03:11:35.185 --> 03:11:38.326
MATT: How do you want to do this?
ALL: (cheering)

03:11:38.327 --> 03:11:40.105
MARISHA: Okay, so I came in the first time.

03:11:40.106 --> 03:11:42.475
Did a few Mai Tai kicks.

03:11:43.358 --> 03:11:45.645
SAM: "Mai Tai"?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:11:45.646 --> 03:11:46.980
<i>That</i> mai tai.

03:11:46.981 --> 03:11:50.033
And then-- (laughter)

03:11:50.034 --> 03:11:51.614
TRAVIS: (drunkenly) Fucking bitch!

03:11:51.615 --> 03:11:53.441
(laughter)

03:11:53.442 --> 03:11:55.641
LIAM: I kick, and I stretch.

03:11:55.642 --> 03:11:59.003
(laughter)
(clapping)

03:11:59.004 --> 03:12:03.815
MARISHA: And then I come back and I take my coconut

03:12:03.816 --> 03:12:06.695
from my fancy cocktail and I bash his head in.

03:12:06.696 --> 03:12:09.396
(laughter)

03:12:09.397 --> 03:12:10.230
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

03:12:10.231 --> 03:12:12.247
MARISHA: I just now have a mai tai.
(laughter)

03:12:12.248 --> 03:12:14.055
TALIESIN: All right.
TRAVIS: It's still happy hour.

03:12:14.056 --> 03:12:16.245
MATT: Monks get all the abilities at the higher levels.

03:12:16.246 --> 03:12:17.961
Some in mai tai.

03:12:17.962 --> 03:12:20.845
MARISHA: Yeah, some in spring break.
(laughter)

03:12:20.846 --> 03:12:21.679
MATT: Okay, yeah.

03:12:21.680 --> 03:12:24.195
As you pummel it with your imaginary coconut,

03:12:24.196 --> 03:12:25.845
the creature fails to continue moving,

03:12:25.846 --> 03:12:27.478
SAM: (drunkenly) You're cute, where'd you come from?

03:12:27.479 --> 03:12:28.915
(laughter)

03:12:28.916 --> 03:12:30.745
MATT: --and collapses to the ground with a heavy whine,

03:12:30.746 --> 03:12:31.920
before it just--

03:12:31.921 --> 03:12:36.775
the eye begins to flail about before going pale

03:12:36.776 --> 03:12:38.485
and then slumps to the ground unmoving.

03:12:38.486 --> 03:12:39.826
The creature is dead.
SAM: What does the eye do?

03:12:39.827 --> 03:12:41.665
MARISHA: Pale?
LIAM: Fjord's about to find out.

03:12:41.666 --> 03:12:42.499
MARISHA: That's weird.

03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:46.815
Okay, yeah, I scooch back into the circle again

03:12:46.816 --> 03:12:48.722
and I'm like, yeah, I don't know.

03:12:48.723 --> 03:12:52.483
It feels other-worldly, this thing.

03:12:52.484 --> 03:12:53.605
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: That's my turn.

03:12:53.606 --> 03:12:54.949
MATT: All right, because I forgot to take it,

03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:56.565
because technically you're on the same initiative.

03:12:56.566 --> 03:12:58.085
The other absorber's going to take his turn.

03:12:58.086 --> 03:12:59.535
TRAVIS: Cool.

03:12:59.536 --> 03:13:01.619
MATT: So the other absorber spins around.

03:13:04.136 --> 03:13:05.374
And is going to rush up to you.

03:13:05.375 --> 03:13:07.225
(rapid stomping sounds)

03:13:07.226 --> 03:13:08.295
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

03:13:08.296 --> 03:13:09.928
MATT: (chuckles)

03:13:11.386 --> 03:13:13.295
TRAVIS: Animal handling, heel!

03:13:13.296 --> 03:13:15.239
LIAM: Hi, doggy.
MATT: 30 feet there.

03:13:16.336 --> 03:13:19.105
It is going to make three attacks against you.

03:13:19.106 --> 03:13:20.988
TRAVIS: I should've taken-- I should have backed up more.

03:13:20.989 --> 03:13:23.299
SAM: How would you know?
TRAVIS: I was right, I had a feeling.

03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:26.079
MATT: With it's bite-- let's see here.

03:13:27.866 --> 03:13:28.932
No, actually.

03:13:31.076 --> 03:13:33.665
It's going to take two of its claws

03:13:33.666 --> 03:13:36.609
and those attacks against you are going to be--

03:13:39.037 --> 03:13:40.527
23 to hit?

03:13:40.528 --> 03:13:42.005
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

03:13:42.006 --> 03:13:43.365
MATT: Natural 20.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:13:43.366 --> 03:13:44.808
TALIESIN: How many feet away?

03:13:46.556 --> 03:13:47.925
MATT: The creature is--

03:13:47.926 --> 03:13:49.015
TALIESIN: No, Fjord.

03:13:49.016 --> 03:13:52.277
MATT: Fjord is--
TRAVIS: 15, 20, 25, 30.

03:13:52.278 --> 03:13:53.585
MATT: 35 feet from you.

03:13:53.586 --> 03:13:55.145
TALIESIN: 35 fucking--

03:13:55.146 --> 03:13:56.472
MATT: You can count them.
SAM: (laughs)

03:13:56.473 --> 03:13:58.535
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30-

03:13:58.536 --> 03:14:00.099
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.
MATT: 35.

03:14:01.108 --> 03:14:02.433
LAURA: Plus, I think you already used, you get that--

03:14:02.434 --> 03:14:04.721
TALIESIN: No, my reaction is-- I get that many times.

03:14:04.722 --> 03:14:06.904
LAURA: That's awesome.
ASHLEY: That's so cool.

03:14:06.905 --> 03:14:07.932
TALIESIN: Yeah, nothing I can do about it.

03:14:07.933 --> 03:14:08.874
LIAM: Just out of reach.

03:14:08.875 --> 03:14:10.081
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

03:14:10.082 --> 03:14:11.439
TRAVIS: Step back one.

03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:12.471
TALIESIN: One more step.

03:14:12.472 --> 03:14:16.885
MATT: So you take 10 points of slashing damage.

03:14:16.886 --> 03:14:17.719
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:19.191
MATT: Along with six points of force damage.

03:14:19.192 --> 03:14:20.025
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:14:21.222 --> 03:14:23.811
MATT: The crit-- (laughs)

03:14:23.812 --> 03:14:26.511
Only rolled a three, so that's six points of--

03:14:26.512 --> 03:14:28.965
Ah, sorry, 11 points of slashing damage.

03:14:30.202 --> 03:14:32.371
Plus the five points of force damage.

03:14:32.372 --> 03:14:33.342
TRAVIS: All right.

03:14:33.343 --> 03:14:38.331
MATT: And it's going to, as it's slashing towards you,

03:14:38.332 --> 03:14:41.071
the eye (shushes) arcs above you.

03:14:41.072 --> 03:14:41.905
TRAVIS: There's the eye.

03:14:41.906 --> 03:14:45.471
MATT: Ignores you, looks over towards Caduceus,

03:14:45.472 --> 03:14:46.442
who's the closest to it.

03:14:46.443 --> 03:14:48.071
TALIESIN: I'm invisible.

03:14:48.072 --> 03:14:50.021
MATT: And does not look towards you.

03:14:50.022 --> 03:14:52.163
Instead, is going to fire towards Essek.

03:14:52.164 --> 03:14:54.514
MARISHA: (gasps)
MARISHA and SAM: No!

03:14:54.515 --> 03:14:56.202
LIAM: Oh, bubby.

03:14:56.203 --> 03:14:58.277
MARISHA: Hit Caduceus! No!

03:14:58.278 --> 03:15:01.195
(laughter)

03:15:02.652 --> 03:15:04.845
MATT: That hits.
TALIESIN: Even through the barrier?

03:15:05.702 --> 03:15:06.781
MATT: It's not a spell.

03:15:06.782 --> 03:15:09.361
TALIESIN: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:15:09.362 --> 03:15:11.261
MATT: Yeah, this-- It doesn't block

03:15:11.262 --> 03:15:13.601
all magical everything, period.

03:15:13.602 --> 03:15:15.525
It blocks spells.
LIAM: Spells.

03:15:16.627 --> 03:15:19.041
TRAVIS: I didn't do the radiant because I figure it's immune

03:15:19.042 --> 03:15:20.491
like the other ones.

03:15:20.492 --> 03:15:22.391
MATT: So that, however--
LAURA: Why did it attack

03:15:22.392 --> 03:15:23.991
Essek instead of you?

03:15:23.992 --> 03:15:25.482
Maybe it can't--

03:15:25.483 --> 03:15:27.288
SAM: Because it already did damage to Fjord.

03:15:27.289 --> 03:15:28.481
It wants to spread it around?

03:15:28.482 --> 03:15:29.659
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Maybe.

03:15:29.660 --> 03:15:31.133
LIAM: I didn't see what it did. Maybe it can't.

03:15:31.134 --> 03:15:32.411
Maybe it needs long range.

03:15:32.412 --> 03:15:34.711
SAM: Maybe it looked at Fjord's

03:15:34.712 --> 03:15:37.178
wrists and deltoids, and it was like, it's fine.
TRAVIS: It could also be looking

03:15:37.179 --> 03:15:38.451
for arcane practitioners like wizards.

03:15:38.452 --> 03:15:39.521
LIAM: It could be.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:15:39.522 --> 03:15:40.912
LIAM: It could be a thing like when you don't want to

03:15:40.913 --> 03:15:42.621
use a bow and arrow right next to somebody.

03:15:42.622 --> 03:15:44.811
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: What smells, Laura?

03:15:44.812 --> 03:15:46.116
LAURA: I smell, like, old food or something.

03:15:46.117 --> 03:15:48.635
MATT: Essek takes 24 points.

03:15:49.989 --> 03:15:51.366
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:15:51.367 --> 03:15:52.200
TRAVIS: 24, wow.

03:15:52.201 --> 03:15:54.621
MATT: Points of psychic damage.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:15:54.622 --> 03:15:56.841
MATT: As the beam streaks forward and slams him,

03:15:56.842 --> 03:15:58.749
and you watch him go, "Augh!"

03:15:58.750 --> 03:16:00.757
And he's currently holding his--
LIAM: Oh no.

03:16:00.758 --> 03:16:02.791
MATT: Which, for the record, I'm going to do Essek's turn

03:16:02.792 --> 03:16:04.141
after this, because I keep forgetting,

03:16:04.142 --> 03:16:06.206
because you have too many players, and an NPC with you.

03:16:06.207 --> 03:16:07.214
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:16:07.215 --> 03:16:09.711
MATT: He's going to get his turn right after this creature.

03:16:09.712 --> 03:16:11.289
So anyway, that finishes its turn.

03:16:11.290 --> 03:16:13.223
Essek retracts from that.

03:16:13.224 --> 03:16:15.111
He rolled super low on his initiative, a natural four.

03:16:15.112 --> 03:16:16.411
But nevertheless, he's going to go ahead,

03:16:16.412 --> 03:16:17.695
and retort with his go.

03:16:19.302 --> 03:16:21.494
Essek is going to cast--

03:16:24.562 --> 03:16:27.341
Let's do, let's do some fun-ness here.

03:16:27.342 --> 03:16:31.085
TRAVIS: Yeah, gimme that Duo Nancy!

03:16:31.086 --> 03:16:32.052
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:16:32.053 --> 03:16:33.866
TRAVIS: I said Duo Nancy, but--

03:16:33.867 --> 03:16:35.219
(laughter)

03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:36.673
TALIESIN: Good band.

03:16:36.674 --> 03:16:38.878
SAM: Good band, yeah.

03:16:38.879 --> 03:16:41.389
TRAVIS: Please welcome to the stage, Duo Nancy!

03:16:41.390 --> 03:16:45.076
MATT: Ugh, it doesn't work well for that necessarily.

03:16:46.942 --> 03:16:47.802
TALIESIN: Huh.

03:16:47.803 --> 03:16:50.576
LAURA: We are Duo Nancy, and we're here to fuck shit up!

03:16:50.577 --> 03:16:53.348
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four!
(laughter)

03:16:53.349 --> 03:16:54.791
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't help

03:16:54.792 --> 03:16:56.611
that he was behind the pillar first place.

03:16:56.612 --> 03:16:58.838
And so, I think he's right out of my field of view.

03:16:58.839 --> 03:17:00.291
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:17:00.292 --> 03:17:02.621
MATT: He's going to go ahead and step back,

03:17:02.622 --> 03:17:04.481
and turn this way, and he's going to go ahead,

03:17:04.482 --> 03:17:08.671
and cast Gravity Sinkhole back in this direction.

03:17:08.672 --> 03:17:10.195
TALIESIN: Yeah, they are.
MATT: Try and crush that creature right there.

03:17:10.196 --> 03:17:11.222
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

03:17:11.223 --> 03:17:13.964
TRAVIS: Yeah. [inaudible] and get out of there.

03:17:22.172 --> 03:17:25.321
MATT: All right, so that is a constitution saving throw

03:17:25.322 --> 03:17:26.222
for that creature.

03:17:27.122 --> 03:17:28.352
Natural three, it's a fail.

03:17:28.353 --> 03:17:30.321
TRAVIS: Yes, fail, you bastard.

03:17:30.322 --> 03:17:32.966
MATT: So he takes 5d10 force damage.

03:17:32.967 --> 03:17:33.984
MARISHA: Kill him.

03:17:34.912 --> 03:17:36.903
SAM: (husky voice) You guys like to party?

03:17:36.904 --> 03:17:40.091
MARISHA: (laughs) Get outta here, Chad.

03:17:40.092 --> 03:17:42.908
TRAVIS: (laughs) Chad?

03:17:42.909 --> 03:17:44.701
SAM: (Chad voice) What?

03:17:44.702 --> 03:17:47.126
MATT: 29 points of force damage to that guy.

03:17:47.127 --> 03:17:48.335
LAURA: Nice.

03:17:50.014 --> 03:17:51.239
SAM: Let's party.

03:17:52.772 --> 03:17:55.471
MATT: And it's pulled in a straight line towards the sphere,

03:17:55.472 --> 03:17:58.869
ending on-- So it pulls him (shh) right there.

03:17:58.870 --> 03:18:01.928
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Yes, yes.

03:18:01.929 --> 03:18:04.041
MATT: And so, as he spins around, and you watch as he

03:18:04.042 --> 03:18:06.451
takes the impact from his brain, spins between the group

03:18:06.452 --> 03:18:08.331
as he's gliding there, turns around,

03:18:08.332 --> 03:18:10.001
and puts his hands in the air,

03:18:10.002 --> 03:18:12.841
and (grunts) rakes them through from the sky to the floor.

03:18:12.842 --> 03:18:15.806
And as it does, you watch this black sphere

03:18:15.807 --> 03:18:18.141
apparate in that space, consuming the creature.

03:18:18.142 --> 03:18:20.931
You hear this howl as the sphere

03:18:20.932 --> 03:18:22.161
collides into a center point,

03:18:22.162 --> 03:18:24.171
and you see the creature for a brief moment

03:18:24.172 --> 03:18:26.581
getting spaghettified towards its center point.

03:18:26.582 --> 03:18:28.861
Its body gets tugged and pulled unnaturally

03:18:28.862 --> 03:18:31.131
stretched forward, taking all of this damage

03:18:31.132 --> 03:18:33.461
as it's yanked in there, and nearly stumbles to the ground

03:18:33.462 --> 03:18:34.831
before catching itself.

03:18:34.832 --> 03:18:37.382
As Essek, "(panting)"

03:18:38.822 --> 03:18:41.191
Rights himself in the middle of the chaos.

03:18:41.192 --> 03:18:43.651
TRAVIS: Beautiful.
SAM: So the monster's still alive?

03:18:43.652 --> 03:18:45.059
MATT: Oh yeah.
LAURA: He got spaghettified

03:18:45.060 --> 03:18:46.231
and he survived it.

03:18:46.232 --> 03:18:47.090
SAM: Whoa.

03:18:47.091 --> 03:18:48.691
MATT: Jester, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

03:18:48.692 --> 03:18:50.951
LAURA: Whoa.

03:18:50.952 --> 03:18:53.577
I'm going to--
MATT: A little timey-wimey there.

03:18:53.578 --> 03:18:54.485
MARISHA: Hmm?

03:18:54.486 --> 03:18:55.570
MATT: A little timey-wimey with the initiative there,

03:18:55.571 --> 03:18:57.281
but we got all those rounds in, which is important.

03:18:57.282 --> 03:18:59.651
ASHLEY: Is he stuck where he is?

03:18:59.652 --> 03:19:02.195
Or that was just-- He got spaghettified?

03:19:03.582 --> 03:19:05.671
MATT: No, he got, he gets pulled towards the center

03:19:05.672 --> 03:19:07.125
of the sphere, and takes the damage.

03:19:07.126 --> 03:19:08.333
ASHLEY: Got it, okay, okay, okay.

03:19:08.334 --> 03:19:09.172
MATT: He is where he is now.

03:19:09.173 --> 03:19:12.401
LAURA: Did the blue pulsing light ever go off or anything?

03:19:12.402 --> 03:19:13.235
MATT: Not yet.

03:19:13.236 --> 03:19:14.651
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Hmm.

03:19:14.652 --> 03:19:18.071
LAURA: I am going to do the thing that I can do right now.

03:19:18.072 --> 03:19:21.081
And I'm assuming I'm--
Well, I'm going to run forward

03:19:21.082 --> 03:19:24.611
to where I'm within 20 feet of the green guy.

03:19:24.612 --> 03:19:25.941
MATT: Okay, about 20 feet to be there--

03:19:25.942 --> 03:19:28.341
TALIESIN: He may not be magically safe.

03:19:28.342 --> 03:19:30.692
You might be able to nail him with magic stuff.

03:19:32.112 --> 03:19:33.881
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: We didn't extract aspects,

03:19:33.882 --> 03:19:34.951
so we don't know if he--

03:19:34.952 --> 03:19:36.684
LAURA: That's true, well,

03:19:36.685 --> 03:19:38.521
I don't want to waste a spell if not,

03:19:38.522 --> 03:19:40.887
I'm just going to chuck my handaxe at him!

03:19:40.888 --> 03:19:43.313
TALIESIN: Wow.
MATT: Yeah! Go for it.

03:19:44.245 --> 03:19:46.702
(whooshing) Go ahead and roll an attack.

03:19:46.703 --> 03:19:48.961
LAURA: (laughs) 25!

03:19:48.962 --> 03:19:50.789
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:52.001
TALIESIN: So excited.

03:19:52.002 --> 03:19:53.521
MATT: But your handaxe is now embedded in the creature,

03:19:53.522 --> 03:19:55.267
you have to get within melee of it to retrieve it.

03:19:55.268 --> 03:19:56.789
LAURA: Shit! (laughs)

03:19:56.790 --> 03:19:58.667
LIAM: You hit me in my ear!
LAURA: I know!

03:19:58.668 --> 03:20:00.196
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:20:00.197 --> 03:20:03.247
LAURA: (singing gibberish) Nope.

03:20:03.248 --> 03:20:06.018
(singing gibberish)

03:20:06.019 --> 03:20:09.341
Why do I roll so fucking low all the fucking time?

03:20:09.342 --> 03:20:10.704
(laughter)

03:20:10.705 --> 03:20:12.452
LIAM: You just rolled really high, you hit.
LAURA: 11!

03:20:12.453 --> 03:20:14.333
MATT: I don't know, there was that
hundred points of damage

03:20:14.334 --> 03:20:16.291
you did that one time.

03:20:16.292 --> 03:20:17.407
LAURA: Sure.
MATT: But how much was that?

03:20:17.408 --> 03:20:18.551
That was a total of--
LAURA: 11.

03:20:18.552 --> 03:20:20.592
MATT: 11. 11 points of damage, that axe is now--

03:20:20.593 --> 03:20:22.325
LAURA: Wait, wait, let me make sure I sure I did that.

03:20:22.326 --> 03:20:24.445
MATT: -- into its chest clavicle area.

03:20:24.446 --> 03:20:27.345
(groaning) (roaring)

03:20:27.346 --> 03:20:29.171
SAM: Oh.
MARISHA: In the clavicle.

03:20:29.172 --> 03:20:34.172
MATT: Imagine that terrible
screaming bear sound from Annihilation that--

03:20:34.202 --> 03:20:35.352
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

03:20:35.353 --> 03:20:38.119
MATT: (horrific screeching)

03:20:38.120 --> 03:20:40.293
ASHLEY: Horrifying.
TRAVIS: Oh god, fucking jeez.

03:20:40.294 --> 03:20:42.459
MATT: I love it, so much.
TRAVIS: Yes, I remember, I remember!

03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:44.368
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, layer in.

03:20:46.202 --> 03:20:47.774
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn?

03:20:47.775 --> 03:20:48.874
LAURA: I-- yeah.

03:20:48.875 --> 03:20:50.540
MATT: All right, Jester's up. Yasha, your turn.

03:20:50.541 --> 03:20:52.352
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: I need to sleep, you guys.

03:20:53.492 --> 03:20:55.281
ASHLEY: Oh, dang, I can't do my--

03:20:55.282 --> 03:20:56.791
TRAVIS: Sleepy after this.

03:20:56.792 --> 03:20:58.469
ASHLEY: Zealous Presence, I've already used it.

03:20:58.470 --> 03:21:01.771
Okay, I'm going to run over to the big boy.

03:21:01.772 --> 03:21:04.105
MATT: Over here?
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:21:05.203 --> 03:21:08.104
TRAVIS: There's another one up here!

03:21:08.105 --> 03:21:09.421
(laughter)

03:21:09.422 --> 03:21:10.621
MATT: You hear as you turn and look,

03:21:10.622 --> 03:21:12.111
and there's one just currently

03:21:12.112 --> 03:21:13.715
harrying Fjord down the hallway.

03:21:13.716 --> 03:21:14.784
LAURA: (yells)

03:21:14.785 --> 03:21:16.514
MATT: Yasha, what are you doing?
ASHLEY: I'll take a swing!

03:21:16.515 --> 03:21:18.607
MATT: All right, go for it.
MARISHA: It's always Fjord!

03:21:18.608 --> 03:21:21.260
(laughter)

03:21:21.261 --> 03:21:23.488
TRAVIS: Follow my voice!

03:21:23.489 --> 03:21:25.241
ASHLEY: 24.

03:21:25.242 --> 03:21:27.131
MATT: 24 does hit.
ASHLEY: Yay!

03:21:27.132 --> 03:21:30.921
Okay, we don't know--
Radiant does not work with this one?

03:21:30.922 --> 03:21:31.832
We already know this?
MATT: We'll find out. Go ahead and

03:21:31.833 --> 03:21:33.758
roll your weapon damage

03:21:33.759 --> 03:21:34.742
and your radiant damage separately.

03:21:34.742 --> 03:21:35.575
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:21:38.622 --> 03:21:42.651
This one is-- We'll make those two.

03:21:42.652 --> 03:21:43.865
So that is.

03:21:45.682 --> 03:21:48.532
I'm really sorry, guys, I'm so bad at math.

03:21:48.533 --> 03:21:51.897
16, wait.

03:21:52.762 --> 03:21:55.161
29, that's without radiant.

03:21:55.162 --> 03:21:56.311
MATT: 29 damage?

03:21:56.312 --> 03:21:57.681
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Wow.

03:21:57.682 --> 03:22:00.271
MATT: For 2d6 plus--

03:22:00.272 --> 03:22:02.315
ASHLEY: 2d6, eight plus.

03:22:04.522 --> 03:22:05.721
MATT: Plus your strength, which is three,

03:22:05.722 --> 03:22:07.111
plus your weapon, which is three,

03:22:07.112 --> 03:22:10.181
plus your rage, which is four, right?

03:22:10.182 --> 03:22:12.776
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on, I calculated this wrong.

03:22:12.777 --> 03:22:15.752
(sighs) So embarrassing having to do this on fucking camera!

03:22:15.753 --> 03:22:17.201
(laughter)

03:22:17.202 --> 03:22:18.766
TRAVIS: Math is every barbarian's weakness.

03:22:18.767 --> 03:22:19.946
MATT: It's all good, yeah, all the math--

03:22:19.947 --> 03:22:21.261
ASHLEY: Sorry, 18.

03:22:21.262 --> 03:22:23.051
MATT: 18, got it.
ASHLEY: That makes more sense.

03:22:23.052 --> 03:22:24.581
MATT: And what's the radiant?
TRAVIS: -- reverse math.

03:22:24.582 --> 03:22:26.201
ASHLEY: Seven.
LIAM: Every one of us has screwed up math.

03:22:26.202 --> 03:22:28.791
MATT: You strike through, and as the blade

03:22:28.792 --> 03:22:31.771
carves through its body, (hisses) it reacts to it,

03:22:31.772 --> 03:22:33.651
and you see the burst of radiant energy

03:22:33.652 --> 03:22:35.474
scatter off with no additional effect.
ASHLEY: Do nothing.

03:22:35.475 --> 03:22:37.260
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. All right, good to know.
ASHLEY: All right.

03:22:37.261 --> 03:22:39.541
TRAVIS: All that adding for nothing, you <i>dick</i>!

03:22:39.542 --> 03:22:41.448
ASHLEY: I know, second hit.

03:22:41.449 --> 03:22:44.282
MATT: Second hit, roll for damage.
Roll for attack, sorry.

03:22:47.592 --> 03:22:49.050
ASHLEY: 21.
MATT: 21 hits.

03:22:49.051 --> 03:22:50.433
ASHLEY: Yep.
MATT: Roll damage for the second one.

03:22:50.434 --> 03:22:51.267
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:22:52.442 --> 03:22:54.645
Ooh, hoo hoo.

03:22:58.376 --> 03:23:00.221
21 points of damage.

03:23:00.222 --> 03:23:01.894
MATT: Nice!

03:23:01.895 --> 03:23:03.135
SAM: Nice roll, Jester.

03:23:05.132 --> 03:23:07.371
MARISHA: Whoa, did you get that too?

03:23:07.372 --> 03:23:08.571
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you do it on the thing,

03:23:08.572 --> 03:23:10.761
it shows it to everyone.
MARISHA: It shows it to everyone in the campaign?

03:23:10.762 --> 03:23:11.595
ASHLEY: Oh yeah!

03:23:11.596 --> 03:23:14.411
LAURA: Oh, really? I was just hitting the button.

03:23:14.412 --> 03:23:16.279
MARISHA: It was like, "Jester rolled this--"

03:23:16.280 --> 03:23:20.011
Whoa! Fjord rolled of Cone of Cold damage.

03:23:20.012 --> 03:23:20.873
ASHLEY: Whoa!
LAURA: We can do that,

03:23:20.874 --> 03:23:22.077
and everyone can know what we do,

03:23:22.078 --> 03:23:23.477
that's so cool!
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's cool.

03:23:23.478 --> 03:23:24.627
TALIESIN: We wouldn't have noticed if we were

03:23:24.628 --> 03:23:27.481
making eye contact all the time.
MATT: D&amp;D Beyond, a great tool for campaign planning.

03:23:27.482 --> 03:23:29.473
MARISHA: Wow, you learned something new.

03:23:29.474 --> 03:23:31.381
LAURA: I'm going to do that because I'm, you know.

03:23:31.382 --> 03:23:34.251
But then, wait, then I got to do the 2d8.
TRAVIS: What about all those real dice you have?

03:23:34.252 --> 03:23:37.450
LAURA: I know, okay.
But this seems fun right now!

03:23:37.451 --> 03:23:39.106
MATT: Old hat, Travis!

03:23:40.612 --> 03:23:43.201
TALIESIN: Wow.
MATT: That finish your turn, Yasha?

03:23:43.202 --> 03:23:44.731
ASHLEY: I can't, as a bonus action,

03:23:44.732 --> 03:23:48.552
try to pull the axe out and give it to Jester, can I?

03:23:48.553 --> 03:23:50.215
MATT: Mm.
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a lot.

03:23:51.490 --> 03:23:52.997
MATT: I could allow it.
ASHLEY: All right.

03:23:52.998 --> 03:23:53.831
I'm going to give it a go.

03:23:53.832 --> 03:23:57.531
MATT: Make a strength check
because it is a quick yank-out.

03:23:57.532 --> 03:23:58.871
Both hands are on your sword,

03:23:58.872 --> 03:24:00.691
so it's a cursory thing just for the hell of it.

03:24:00.692 --> 03:24:02.300
Do a strength check, you have advantage.
LAURA: I didn't do a lot of damage,

03:24:02.301 --> 03:24:04.736
so it's not deeply embedded.

03:24:04.737 --> 03:24:06.056
ASHLEY: 19.

03:24:06.057 --> 03:24:07.586
MATT: (whooshing) You pull it out and hand it back

03:24:07.587 --> 03:24:08.712
over your shoulder--
LAURA: Yes!

03:24:08.713 --> 03:24:09.806
MARISHA: Oh, that's dope!

03:24:09.807 --> 03:24:11.621
MATT: You throw it and Jester, she's a ways away,

03:24:11.622 --> 03:24:13.538
so you chuck it behind. You're like, "Oh god!"

03:24:13.539 --> 03:24:15.757
And catch it midair.

03:24:15.758 --> 03:24:17.521
ASHLEY: Hand back on the hilt.

03:24:17.522 --> 03:24:19.599
At ready, and I'll stay.
LAURA: Thanks, Yasha!

03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:21.759
ASHLEY: You got it.
MATT: All right.

03:24:21.760 --> 03:24:23.561
So that finishes your turn.
TRAVIS: So boss, babe.

03:24:23.562 --> 03:24:24.778
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:24:24.779 --> 03:24:26.628
MATT: All right.

03:24:26.629 --> 03:24:28.691
The creature--
LAURA: Brandishing the axe.

03:24:28.692 --> 03:24:31.282
MATT: -- kind of (sniffing).

03:24:31.283 --> 03:24:33.415
It's taking the damage from you and being wounded,

03:24:33.416 --> 03:24:37.581
but it's (sniffing) sniffing around you.

03:24:37.582 --> 03:24:40.556
At the top of its turn,

03:24:40.557 --> 03:24:44.981
the tower above (hisses), it's been blasting

03:24:44.982 --> 03:24:48.141
the orb around you, but is now (whooshes)

03:24:48.142 --> 03:24:51.861
the blast is coming towards that creature.

03:24:51.862 --> 03:24:54.881
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Which has advantage on it,

03:24:54.882 --> 03:24:56.121
which it does save against.

03:24:56.122 --> 03:24:59.039
LIAM: He's so fast.
ASHLEY: I was wondering about that.

03:24:59.040 --> 03:24:59.873
TALIESIN: Mm.

03:25:02.962 --> 03:25:05.623
LIAM: That guy looks like he's on the keto diet.

03:25:05.624 --> 03:25:08.207
LAURA: (laughs)

03:25:09.516 --> 03:25:11.347
MATT: He takes 11 points of lightning damage.
MARISHA: He's got to be in order to be buff

03:25:11.348 --> 03:25:12.664
for spring break, you know?
TALIESIN: Okay, okay.

03:25:12.665 --> 03:25:14.331
TRAVIS: 11?
MATT: 11 points of lightning damage.

03:25:14.332 --> 03:25:16.314
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay, okay.
LIAM: Tiny waist here.

03:25:16.315 --> 03:25:17.971
Big up top.
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:25:17.972 --> 03:25:19.971
MATT: And is going to--
TRAVIS: Right, thank you.

03:25:19.972 --> 03:25:21.641
MATT: -- shift around here.

03:25:21.642 --> 03:25:23.231
ASHLEY: Do I get an attack?
LIAM: Get out!

03:25:23.232 --> 03:25:25.728
MATT: No, because it never left your melee range.

03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:26.645
LIAM: Oh boy.

03:25:26.646 --> 03:25:28.391
MATT: But it has moved into the orb,

03:25:28.392 --> 03:25:30.621
where it's now seeing it apparating

03:25:30.622 --> 03:25:32.374
from the center boy.
LIAM: Oh boy.

03:25:32.375 --> 03:25:34.568
MATT: (growls) And it's going to go ahead

03:25:34.569 --> 03:25:36.741
and go all in against Caleb.

03:25:36.742 --> 03:25:38.699
LIAM: If I don't move, he won't see me.
LAURA and SAM: No!

03:25:38.700 --> 03:25:40.229
MATT: That's easy.
LIAM: Oh.

03:25:40.230 --> 03:25:41.681
MATT: (laughs)

03:25:41.682 --> 03:25:44.343
That is a 22 to hit.

03:25:44.344 --> 03:25:45.668
LIAM: Uh--

03:25:45.669 --> 03:25:46.721
Yeah, it hits.

03:25:46.722 --> 03:25:47.555
MATT: Okay.

03:25:48.471 --> 03:25:50.811
(inhales) 24 to hit.

03:25:50.812 --> 03:25:53.610
LIAM: That one doesn't hit, strangely. Hits.

03:25:53.611 --> 03:25:57.014
MATT: All right, so it's two claw strikes against you.

03:25:57.015 --> 03:25:58.506
You take

03:26:00.090 --> 03:26:02.714
eight points of slashing damage,

03:26:02.715 --> 03:26:04.961
as well as-- Ooh!

03:26:04.962 --> 03:26:06.831
12 points of force damage.

03:26:06.832 --> 03:26:08.851
As its claws slice into you, and

03:26:08.852 --> 03:26:10.393
it lifts you off the ground for a second,

03:26:10.394 --> 03:26:13.282
you watch it arcs upward as Caleb's lifted up,

03:26:13.283 --> 03:26:16.194
and then there's an additional burst in his chest,

03:26:16.195 --> 03:26:18.721
and it throws him about a foot off of the claws.

03:26:18.722 --> 03:26:20.391
Almost like it launches him into the air.

03:26:20.392 --> 03:26:23.149
And the other claw strikes down to catch him

03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:24.595
with a reversal from over top.

03:26:24.596 --> 03:26:25.670
LIAM: (groans)
LAURA: Uh-oh.

03:26:25.671 --> 03:26:27.761
MATT: That one deals

03:26:27.762 --> 03:26:29.861
six points of piercing damage,

03:26:29.862 --> 03:26:32.231
and 10 points of force damage.

03:26:32.232 --> 03:26:34.401
As you get slammed into the ground

03:26:34.402 --> 03:26:36.531
from the second strike blasting you onto the floor,

03:26:36.532 --> 03:26:38.661
you catch yourself on your hands and knees,

03:26:38.662 --> 03:26:42.261
as it opens its jaw, (hisses) and attempts to bite down

03:26:42.262 --> 03:26:44.561
towards you on the ground.

03:26:44.562 --> 03:26:47.356
For a 21 to hit?

03:26:47.357 --> 03:26:48.881
LIAM: Shield.
MATT: Shield?

03:26:48.882 --> 03:26:50.281
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:26:50.282 --> 03:26:53.091
MATT: As it bites down, you (groans) lift up your hand,

03:26:53.092 --> 03:26:56.185
and with that, this shimmering,

03:26:58.122 --> 03:27:01.541
yeah, this shimmering barrier,

03:27:01.542 --> 03:27:03.511
deflects its claws, or its teeth,

03:27:03.512 --> 03:27:05.791
and its jaw just skitters off to the side

03:27:05.792 --> 03:27:08.901
with a scraping sound, arcane sparks flying off.

03:27:08.902 --> 03:27:12.271
It (growling) picks up angrily,

03:27:12.272 --> 03:27:13.541
and begins growling at your space,

03:27:13.542 --> 03:27:16.791
frustrated that it couldn't get through for a third bite.

03:27:16.792 --> 03:27:18.882
But that's going to finish its turn.

03:27:18.883 --> 03:27:20.281
Veth, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

03:27:20.282 --> 03:27:21.311
LIAM: He's looking pretty rough.

03:27:21.312 --> 03:27:25.735
SAM: Oh boy, I'm going to jump up and sort of grab Caleb,

03:27:27.172 --> 03:27:32.051
and angrily point my weapon at the creature,

03:27:32.052 --> 03:27:36.011
like the woman yelling at the cat meme,

03:27:36.012 --> 03:27:38.612
you know, except it's me.

03:27:38.613 --> 03:27:41.189
And it's not a cat, it's a sex monster.

03:27:41.190 --> 03:27:42.531
(laughter)

03:27:42.532 --> 03:27:43.365
MATT: All righty.
SAM: Hey you,

03:27:43.366 --> 03:27:45.341
get away from my friend!

03:27:45.342 --> 03:27:46.951
And I'll shoot him in the face.

03:27:46.952 --> 03:27:48.371
MATT: Okay, roll an attack.

03:27:48.372 --> 03:27:49.205
SAM: Yeah.

03:27:50.102 --> 03:27:52.421
Oh, not great, 21.

03:27:52.422 --> 03:27:54.083
MATT: There was--
SAM: Oh, why did I roll twice?

03:27:54.084 --> 03:27:55.225
MATT: I don't know why.
SAM: I don't know.

03:27:55.226 --> 03:27:56.914
Should I throw them both out, or--?

03:27:56.915 --> 03:27:57.865
MATT: Just roll one more.

03:27:57.865 --> 03:27:58.698
SAM: Okay.

03:27:59.792 --> 03:28:01.938
Ooh, that's a natural one.

03:28:01.939 --> 03:28:02.772
LAURA: Aw.

03:28:02.773 --> 03:28:04.031
TRAVIS: Oh, and your crossbow.

03:28:04.032 --> 03:28:06.394
MATT: Yep, so you miss it and you hurt yourself.

03:28:06.395 --> 03:28:08.357
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

03:28:08.358 --> 03:28:09.682
Yeah, yeah.

03:28:09.683 --> 03:28:12.032
Luckily, I only take five points of damage.

03:28:12.033 --> 03:28:14.151
MATT: As you turn, holding Caleb.

03:28:14.152 --> 03:28:15.635
SAM: I've got you, Caleb, (yells)!

03:28:15.636 --> 03:28:18.416
MATT: (arrow impact)
(laughter)

03:28:18.417 --> 03:28:20.021
Shink! (arrow vibrating)

03:28:20.022 --> 03:28:21.917
(laughter)
All right.

03:28:21.918 --> 03:28:23.192
LAURA: I always love that sound.

03:28:23.193 --> 03:28:24.650
ASHLEY: (arrow vibrating)

03:28:24.651 --> 03:28:27.371
SAM: I'm going to fire again, bonus action.
MATT: Just a small one.

03:28:27.372 --> 03:28:28.709
ASHLEY: I just think of those little door things.

03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:30.502
MATT: Yep.
ASHLEY: When you were just a kid.

03:28:30.503 --> 03:28:33.981
MATT: It's the bigger blades that (vibrating)!

03:28:33.982 --> 03:28:35.251
All right.

03:28:35.252 --> 03:28:36.861
SAM: I'll fire again.
MATT: Go for it.

03:28:36.862 --> 03:28:38.061
LAURA: Oh, I spent so much time as a kid.

03:28:38.062 --> 03:28:38.895
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh, yep.
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:28:38.896 --> 03:28:40.010
SAM: Way better.

03:28:40.011 --> 03:28:41.665
29 to hit.

03:28:41.666 --> 03:28:43.575
MATT: That'll hit, go ahead and roll damage.

03:28:43.576 --> 03:28:46.796
SAM: And I think I still get sneak attack damage

03:28:46.797 --> 03:28:48.661
because he's engaged with my friend?

03:28:48.662 --> 03:28:49.495
MATT: Indeed.

03:28:51.072 --> 03:28:52.846
ASHLEY: We got to get one of those for Ronin.

03:28:52.847 --> 03:28:54.496
LAURA: Yes!

03:28:54.497 --> 03:28:55.330
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:29:00.762 --> 03:29:02.044
SAM: Okay, cool.

03:29:02.045 --> 03:29:04.313
42 points of damage.
LAURA: Whoa!

03:29:04.314 --> 03:29:05.580
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:29:05.581 --> 03:29:07.622
ALL: Oh!

03:29:07.623 --> 03:29:08.456
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:29:09.382 --> 03:29:12.871
SAM: Is he wearing a G-string? Or is that just

03:29:12.872 --> 03:29:13.960
poetic license?
MATT: No, that is just the pattern

03:29:13.961 --> 03:29:15.567
of the flesh.
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

03:29:15.568 --> 03:29:18.228
MATT: But it might be a G-string.
MARISHA: He could be.

03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:19.062
MATT: You can't tell from the--

03:29:19.063 --> 03:29:21.101
SAM: No, I think I've close enough proximity,

03:29:21.102 --> 03:29:24.821
I'm going to just shove the crossbow in its mouth.

03:29:24.822 --> 03:29:25.941
MATT: As it's leaning over Caleb,

03:29:25.942 --> 03:29:27.361
trying to bite into the Shield,

03:29:27.362 --> 03:29:29.471
and you jam it up under its throat. (gags)

03:29:29.472 --> 03:29:32.296
SAM: You can't have sex with my friend.

03:29:32.297 --> 03:29:33.419
(laughter)

03:29:33.420 --> 03:29:36.121
SAM: And I'll squeeze the trigger.

03:29:36.122 --> 03:29:38.459
MATT: And it just collapses onto the Shield.

03:29:38.460 --> 03:29:39.293
SAM: Oh, god!

03:29:39.294 --> 03:29:41.401
MATT: And as you're noticing it

03:29:41.402 --> 03:29:42.861
basically draped over Caleb,

03:29:42.862 --> 03:29:44.921
probably going to crush him when that Shield vanishes,

03:29:44.922 --> 03:29:46.351
you angle it to the side,

03:29:46.352 --> 03:29:48.891
and it slides and slumps

03:29:48.892 --> 03:29:50.732
onto the floor next to you.

03:29:51.802 --> 03:29:53.025
TRAVIS: Nice.
SAM: Yes!

03:29:53.026 --> 03:29:54.393
MATT: All righty.

03:29:54.394 --> 03:29:57.576
TRAVIS: There's another one up here!

03:29:57.577 --> 03:29:59.673
SAM: Welp, we did it, guys!

03:29:59.674 --> 03:30:01.110
Let's go down the hall!

03:30:01.111 --> 03:30:01.944
TRAVIS: (yelps)

03:30:03.218 --> 03:30:07.281
MATT: All righty, that finishes Veth's turn.

03:30:07.282 --> 03:30:08.132
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

03:30:08.133 --> 03:30:09.751
LIAM: Yeah, so Caleb is a bloody mess,

03:30:09.752 --> 03:30:13.511
and he was about to cast a spell centered on the column,

03:30:13.512 --> 03:30:16.711
but now I don't have to, and instead I hear Fjord go,

03:30:16.712 --> 03:30:18.821
(yelling).

03:30:18.822 --> 03:30:21.381
And I hold a black marble out in that direction,

03:30:21.382 --> 03:30:25.356
and copy my Kryn colleague,

03:30:25.357 --> 03:30:27.511
and cast Gravity Sinkhole

03:30:27.512 --> 03:30:31.361
in the far wall behind the eyeball-butt creature.

03:30:31.362 --> 03:30:32.581
MATT: Okay, pulling it that way?

03:30:32.582 --> 03:30:34.218
LIAM: Towards-- past Fjord.

03:30:34.219 --> 03:30:35.052
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:30:35.053 --> 03:30:37.551
LIAM: And I will destroy another wall, possibly.

03:30:37.552 --> 03:30:38.385
MATT: Oh, so you're doing--

03:30:38.386 --> 03:30:39.386
TRAVIS: I think he's saying this way.

03:30:39.387 --> 03:30:40.621
LIAM: Gravity Sinkhole.
MATT: Gravity Sinkhole, yeah.

03:30:40.622 --> 03:30:41.631
LIAM: Exactly where Travis was saying.

03:30:41.632 --> 03:30:46.211
MATT: Okay, so, what's the save on it?

03:30:46.212 --> 03:30:48.791
LIAM: It is constitution save.

03:30:48.792 --> 03:30:49.897
MATT: Constitution.

03:30:51.139 --> 03:30:52.711
WIth advantage, that is 19.

03:30:52.712 --> 03:30:54.241
LIAM: It saves, so it takes the damage,

03:30:54.242 --> 03:30:55.673
but it doesn't get pulled.

03:30:55.674 --> 03:30:57.166
It takes half damage.
MATT: Takes half damage.

03:30:57.167 --> 03:30:58.396
All right, so go ahead and roll full damage.

03:30:58.397 --> 03:30:59.230
LIAM: Yep.

03:31:00.580 --> 03:31:01.864
MATT: (impacts)

03:31:01.865 --> 03:31:04.549
Oh, it doesn't get pulled, it just stays there.

03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:07.904
LIAM: Rolled pretty high, though. (counting)

03:31:07.905 --> 03:31:09.855
TALIESIN: My thing keeps changing.

03:31:11.652 --> 03:31:14.900
LIAM: 18 points, half damage is 18.

03:31:14.901 --> 03:31:18.241
MATT: Okay, that's 18 points of damage.

03:31:18.242 --> 03:31:20.121
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw for me.

03:31:20.122 --> 03:31:21.971
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

03:31:21.972 --> 03:31:23.011
SAM: Dexterity saving throw?

03:31:23.012 --> 03:31:23.953
LAURA: Oh no, should we have

03:31:23.954 --> 03:31:27.691
all been rolling d20s for our magic?

03:31:27.692 --> 03:31:29.771
MATT: Yeah, I keep forgetting that. That's my bad,

03:31:29.772 --> 03:31:31.221
too much to organize.

03:31:31.222 --> 03:31:32.055
We'll do that here in a second.

03:31:32.056 --> 03:31:34.251
We'll do a round of rolls.

03:31:34.252 --> 03:31:37.021
LIAM: Rolled real low, but I equipped the Ring of Evasion,

03:31:37.022 --> 03:31:39.561
so I will choose to succeed.

03:31:39.562 --> 03:31:41.312
MATT: Okay, there you go, so mark that.

03:31:42.712 --> 03:31:45.031
As the tail looks up,

03:31:45.032 --> 03:31:47.801
and as the magical energy bursts,

03:31:47.802 --> 03:31:50.631
the eye seems to glow with energy,

03:31:50.632 --> 03:31:53.911
and you see it try and force a portion of the arcane power

03:31:53.912 --> 03:31:55.621
that you cast back at you,

03:31:55.622 --> 03:31:58.061
and you just dodge past it.

03:31:58.062 --> 03:32:00.451
And you watch a portion of that gravity well

03:32:00.452 --> 03:32:02.455
open up to nothing behind you.

03:32:03.752 --> 03:32:05.317
SAM: Whoa.
TRAVIS: It deflected.

03:32:05.318 --> 03:32:06.484
MARISHA: Absorber.

03:32:06.485 --> 03:32:11.485
MATT: So to go around real fast, roll a d20,

03:32:11.502 --> 03:32:14.191
roll a d20.

03:32:14.192 --> 03:32:16.771
And what did you--?

03:32:16.772 --> 03:32:21.519
TALIESIN: I rolled an unsuccessful Banish.

03:32:21.520 --> 03:32:23.085
MATT: Right, so roll a d20 for me.

03:32:23.086 --> 03:32:24.351
TRAVIS: I rolled a 19.

03:32:24.352 --> 03:32:25.282
MATT: 19.

03:32:25.282 --> 03:32:26.175
LIAM: Five.

03:32:26.175 --> 03:32:27.008
TALIESIN: 12.

03:32:27.009 --> 03:32:29.873
MATT: Okay. Fjord, go ahead and roll a d100 for me, please.

03:32:29.874 --> 03:32:31.351
(groaning)
LIAM: Yay!

03:32:31.352 --> 03:32:33.064
ASHLEY: Ooh!

03:32:33.065 --> 03:32:34.285
TALIESIN: I am here for this.

03:32:36.942 --> 03:32:38.221
MATT: I have a big old note here saying,

03:32:38.222 --> 03:32:39.487
"Aeor spells, make them roll,"

03:32:39.488 --> 03:32:41.521
and I just keep forgetting.
TRAVIS: 34.

03:32:41.522 --> 03:32:43.156
MATT: 34.
LAURA: Oh, wait!

03:32:43.157 --> 03:32:45.309
That's magical butterflies! (laughs)

03:32:45.310 --> 03:32:46.235
Everything--
MATT: Nope!

03:32:46.236 --> 03:32:47.829
MARISHA: It's all magical butterflies.

03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:48.663
MATT: All right.

03:32:48.664 --> 03:32:49.978
ASHLEY: It's Gelidon!
LAURA: Uh-oh.

03:32:49.979 --> 03:32:52.162
MATT: So that finishes Caleb's go.
LIAM: (deep voice) Hey.

03:32:53.272 --> 03:32:54.105
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

03:32:54.106 --> 03:32:55.801
Caduceus, you're up.

03:32:55.802 --> 03:32:57.345
TRAVIS: Nobody else had to roll a d100?

03:32:57.346 --> 03:32:58.966
LAURA: No, you were the only one that--

03:32:58.967 --> 03:33:00.631
MATT: So Caleb, that's all you're doing on your turn?

03:33:00.632 --> 03:33:01.622
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Horse nipples!

03:33:01.623 --> 03:33:03.581
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah, holding the line.

03:33:03.582 --> 03:33:05.511
MATT: You got it.

03:33:05.512 --> 03:33:08.021
TALIESIN: I'm getting a sense of how this is going.

03:33:08.022 --> 03:33:10.707
So I'm going to cast--

03:33:10.708 --> 03:33:11.865
TRAVIS: Help!

03:33:11.866 --> 03:33:14.974
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- How hurt does Fjord look?

03:33:14.975 --> 03:33:16.137
TRAVIS: (yelps)

03:33:16.138 --> 03:33:17.431
(laughter)

03:33:17.432 --> 03:33:19.058
MATT: How hurt do you look?

03:33:19.059 --> 03:33:20.503
TRAVIS: 50%. Ah!
(laughter)

03:33:20.504 --> 03:33:21.891
MATT: So here's the good part.

03:33:21.892 --> 03:33:23.501
You look over at Fjord as he's doing this,

03:33:23.502 --> 03:33:25.001
and as he's shouting over his shoulder for help,

03:33:25.002 --> 03:33:29.976
he looks hurt, but there's something odd about him.

03:33:29.977 --> 03:33:30.810
LAURA: No.

03:33:30.811 --> 03:33:33.608
MATT: There's a darkness pouring down his face.

03:33:33.609 --> 03:33:35.391
ASHLEY: Ah.
SAM: A darkness?

03:33:35.392 --> 03:33:38.034
MATT: So what are you doing?

03:33:38.035 --> 03:33:39.068
MARISHA: What happened to you?

03:33:39.069 --> 03:33:41.251
TRAVIS: Fifth Element?
LIAM: What did you roll?

03:33:41.252 --> 03:33:45.321
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- To start with,

03:33:45.322 --> 03:33:47.610
I'm going to cast--
LIAM: You're turning into the Ring girl!

03:33:47.611 --> 03:33:48.444
LAURA: (gasps)

03:33:48.444 --> 03:33:49.395
TRAVIS: Shut up.

03:33:49.396 --> 03:33:51.111
MARISHA: Your worst nightmare.

03:33:51.112 --> 03:33:53.725
TALIESIN: -- Bless on him.

03:33:54.836 --> 03:33:55.893
MATT: Bless on him?

03:33:55.894 --> 03:33:57.951
TALIESIN: On him, on Fjord, myself, and Veth.

03:33:57.952 --> 03:33:59.201
I'm actually going to have to move a little bit

03:33:59.202 --> 03:34:02.331
closer to him to do that.

03:34:02.332 --> 03:34:03.514
MATT: Yes, you would have to get--

03:34:03.515 --> 03:34:06.074
TRAVIS: I will sleep in the kitchen.

03:34:06.075 --> 03:34:07.379
MATT: -- there.
ASHLEY: Doesn't work with my hair.

03:34:07.380 --> 03:34:08.451
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:34:08.452 --> 03:34:11.560
MATT: You're no longer invisible, but you are there.

03:34:13.164 --> 03:34:14.562
Okay?
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to--

03:34:14.563 --> 03:34:17.451
MATT: So he's blessed, you're blessed, you said?

03:34:17.452 --> 03:34:18.981
TALIESIN: I'm blessed and Veth is blessed.

03:34:18.982 --> 03:34:20.339
MATT: Got it.
SAM: Oh! Thank you.

03:34:20.340 --> 03:34:22.220
TALIESIN: I want you to hit things.

03:34:22.221 --> 03:34:23.831
SAM: But I'm good at that.

03:34:23.832 --> 03:34:25.971
TALIESIN: And actually, well, that's fine.

03:34:25.972 --> 03:34:27.555
I'm going to then spend--

03:34:29.042 --> 03:34:30.391
Something's wrong with Fjord.

03:34:30.392 --> 03:34:32.615
We should probably do something, I don't know.

03:34:32.616 --> 03:34:34.821
And I'm going to see if I can get out of the way

03:34:34.822 --> 03:34:36.313
of the electric thing before it--

03:34:36.314 --> 03:34:38.211
LIAM: I've always thought so as well.

03:34:38.212 --> 03:34:39.365
MATT: Going where?

03:34:40.332 --> 03:34:42.921
TALIESIN: Down into the cubby over there.

03:34:42.922 --> 03:34:44.437
MATT: Over here?
TALIESIN: No, the other way.

03:34:44.438 --> 03:34:45.421
MATT: Over here?

03:34:45.422 --> 03:34:47.291
TALIESIN: Down the hall that we just cleared.

03:34:47.292 --> 03:34:49.046
MATT: Okay, so--
LAURA: Oh, around.

03:34:49.047 --> 03:34:52.051
MATT: Moves five, 10, 15, 25, 30?

03:34:52.052 --> 03:34:54.031
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

03:34:54.032 --> 03:34:54.865
That finishes your turn?

03:34:54.866 --> 03:34:56.031
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:34:56.032 --> 03:34:57.961
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

03:34:57.962 --> 03:35:01.051
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'm going to cast Hex

03:35:01.052 --> 03:35:03.245
against this thing in front of me.

03:35:04.142 --> 03:35:07.475
MATT: Okay, so casting the spell Hex, or using your?

03:35:08.362 --> 03:35:11.391
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, casting the spell Hex.

03:35:11.392 --> 03:35:12.501
TRAVIS: You got it.

03:35:12.502 --> 03:35:15.585
So it is hexed.
TRAVIS: At 1st-level.

03:35:16.472 --> 03:35:18.258
MATT: Well, as a warl--

03:35:18.259 --> 03:35:20.288
Oh, you can cast a warlock spell as a paladin.

03:35:20.289 --> 03:35:21.658
Yeah, so you use your 1st-level paladin slot,

03:35:21.659 --> 03:35:25.491
because you can. ♪ Multiclassing. ♪

03:35:25.492 --> 03:35:26.891
Something's getting in your eyes, too.

03:35:26.892 --> 03:35:27.725
SAM: Uh-oh.

03:35:27.725 --> 03:35:28.625
TRAVIS: It's just sweat.
LAURA: Oh no.

03:35:28.626 --> 03:35:30.153
TRAVIS: I'm just so-- Cool.

03:35:30.154 --> 03:35:33.473
MATT: You pull back, and your palm is filled with hair.

03:35:33.474 --> 03:35:34.564
LAURA: Hair?!
MATT: Yeah.

03:35:34.565 --> 03:35:35.639
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: What are you doing?

03:35:35.640 --> 03:35:36.864
LAURA: <i>Hair</i>?!
SAM: (laughs)

03:35:36.865 --> 03:35:39.098
LAURA: (laughs)

03:35:39.099 --> 03:35:40.239
TRAVIS: Cool!

03:35:40.240 --> 03:35:41.809
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:35:41.810 --> 03:35:43.267
TRAVIS: At 5th-level, I will cast

03:35:43.268 --> 03:35:45.636
Armor of Agathys on myself.

03:35:45.637 --> 03:35:48.861
MATT: Now at this level too, as you do this,

03:35:48.862 --> 03:35:51.361
it isn't just ice particles, but a form

03:35:51.362 --> 03:35:53.271
of ice armor that encased your shoulders

03:35:53.272 --> 03:35:55.188
like a mantle of jagged ice shards.

03:35:55.189 --> 03:35:56.022
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.
MARISHA: Cool.

03:35:56.023 --> 03:35:58.452
MATT: These pointed spaulders now

03:35:58.453 --> 03:36:00.046
jag out to the sides.

03:36:00.047 --> 03:36:00.880
Well done.

03:36:00.881 --> 03:36:03.411
TRAVIS: I regain 25 temporary hit points,

03:36:03.412 --> 03:36:06.688
and I say: Hit me now, bitch. What's wrong with my face?!

03:36:06.689 --> 03:36:07.821
(laughter)

03:36:07.822 --> 03:36:09.384
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:36:09.385 --> 03:36:10.826
TRAVIS: And I will move--

03:36:12.972 --> 03:36:14.951
I'll stay in its melee,

03:36:14.952 --> 03:36:18.071
and I'll move up towards just this side.

03:36:18.072 --> 03:36:19.878
Just move, yeah, 45, thank you.

03:36:19.879 --> 03:36:21.721
MATT: You got it, okay.

03:36:21.722 --> 03:36:24.523
Finishing Fjord's go, it is now the creature's turn.

03:36:24.524 --> 03:36:25.357
LAURA: Oh no.

03:36:25.358 --> 03:36:27.081
MATT: Yeah, it's going to go all in on you.

03:36:27.082 --> 03:36:31.531
It is super, super frustrated and angry.

03:36:31.532 --> 03:36:35.045
That's going to be two claw strikes and a...

03:36:37.152 --> 03:36:38.821
yeah, we'll go with a bite.

03:36:38.822 --> 03:36:42.021
So the claw strikes are

03:36:42.022 --> 03:36:44.252
14 to hit?

03:36:44.253 --> 03:36:46.140
TRAVIS: Misses.
MATT: Misses.

03:36:46.141 --> 03:36:47.571
You just duck out of the way,

03:36:47.572 --> 03:36:49.961
using the blade to parry to the side.

03:36:49.962 --> 03:36:51.615
The next strike is a natural 20.

03:36:51.616 --> 03:36:52.911
TRAVIS: Cool.

03:36:52.912 --> 03:36:55.831
MATT: And the bite strike--
LIAM: Bite strike.

03:36:55.832 --> 03:36:58.801
MATT: -- is a 19.

03:36:58.802 --> 03:37:01.001
TRAVIS: 19 hits.
MATT: Okay.

03:37:01.002 --> 03:37:05.085
So first, the crit for the claw strike.

03:37:06.012 --> 03:37:09.869
That is nine points of slashing damage.

03:37:09.870 --> 03:37:11.051
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:37:11.052 --> 03:37:13.261
MATT: Plus (laughs) two points of force damage,

03:37:13.262 --> 03:37:15.462
rolled terribly for the damage of the crit.

03:37:17.002 --> 03:37:18.633
TRAVIS: So is that doubled up already?

03:37:18.634 --> 03:37:19.721
MATT: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:37:19.722 --> 03:37:20.872
MATT: It rolled really bad.

03:37:21.855 --> 03:37:25.280
And then for its bite strike against you.

03:37:26.572 --> 03:37:27.471
Much better.

03:37:27.472 --> 03:37:29.145
14 points of piercing damage.

03:37:29.146 --> 03:37:29.979
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:37:29.980 --> 03:37:32.808
MATT: Plus eight points of force damage.

03:37:32.809 --> 03:37:33.800
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:37:33.801 --> 03:37:37.532
MATT: And it takes 25 and

03:37:37.533 --> 03:37:39.601
50 points of ice damage total.
TRAVIS: 50 points of ice damage.

03:37:39.602 --> 03:37:41.547
SAM: 50?
LAURA and ASHLEY: Whoa.

03:37:42.562 --> 03:37:43.821
TRAVIS: Yarr.
MATT: Yeah, dude.

03:37:43.822 --> 03:37:47.771
Armor of Agathys is no joke if things hit you in melee.

03:37:47.772 --> 03:37:48.605
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

03:37:49.512 --> 03:37:51.241
MATT: Still have temporary hit points up?

03:37:51.242 --> 03:37:53.033
TRAVIS: Temporary hit points are--

03:37:55.683 --> 03:37:57.331
I have two temporary hit points.

03:37:57.332 --> 03:37:59.031
MATT: Damn, all right.

03:37:59.032 --> 03:38:00.821
LIAM: Man, don't fuck with a warladin.

03:38:00.822 --> 03:38:02.154
MATT: The creature's going to go ahead and

03:38:02.155 --> 03:38:03.743
move over to this space here.
TALIESIN: Thought it was a clerlock.

03:38:03.744 --> 03:38:07.201
MATT: Still staying in the melee with you,

03:38:07.202 --> 03:38:08.816
but now it's starting to glance

03:38:08.817 --> 03:38:10.341
at the rest of the room around you.

03:38:10.342 --> 03:38:11.942
All right, that finishes its go.

03:38:13.092 --> 03:38:14.628
At the bottom is now Essek.

03:38:15.845 --> 03:38:18.770
Essek-- hmm.

03:38:20.782 --> 03:38:23.327
SAM: Is a bard monk a bank?

03:38:23.328 --> 03:38:25.077
MATT: (laughs)

03:38:25.078 --> 03:38:26.212
MARISHA: A bank?
SAM: Yeah.

03:38:26.213 --> 03:38:27.153
LAURA: A bonk.

03:38:27.153 --> 03:38:27.994
SAM: A bonk.

03:38:27.995 --> 03:38:29.724
MARISHA: Oh, bonk is pretty good.

03:38:29.725 --> 03:38:31.731
MATT: He's going to go ahead and cast--

03:38:31.732 --> 03:38:33.750
ASHLEY: Pallock?

03:38:36.112 --> 03:38:37.361
TALIESIN: For blood hunter,

03:38:37.362 --> 03:38:38.401
you just put blood in front of anything.

03:38:38.402 --> 03:38:41.362
Blood wizard, blood cleric.

03:38:41.363 --> 03:38:43.145
MATT: (laughs)

03:38:43.146 --> 03:38:44.821
TALIESIN: Blood monk.

03:38:44.822 --> 03:38:45.802
LAURA: That's pretty cool.
TALIESIN: Blood barbarian.

03:38:45.803 --> 03:38:47.751
MATT: There is a blood cleric.

03:38:47.752 --> 03:38:49.103
TALIESIN: Actually, that's true.

03:38:49.104 --> 03:38:53.500
MATT: He's going to cast Magic Missile at 5th-level.

03:38:53.501 --> 03:38:54.334
LIAM: Pew, pew.

03:38:54.335 --> 03:38:55.874
TRAVIS: Do I need to roll d20s--
MARISHA: Cleric and a paladin--

03:38:55.875 --> 03:38:57.957
TRAVIS: -- for casting those two spells?
MARISHA: -- would just be a cleridin.

03:38:57.958 --> 03:39:00.401
MATT: You do, yes.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:39:00.402 --> 03:39:01.235
MATT: Well, Hex, you don't have to,

03:39:01.236 --> 03:39:02.563
because it was a 1st-level.

03:39:02.564 --> 03:39:03.584
MARISHA: For when your allergies are real bad.
TRAVIS: For Armor of Agathys?

03:39:03.585 --> 03:39:05.542
MATT: For Armor of Agathys, you do. Roll that for me.

03:39:05.543 --> 03:39:06.676
TRAVIS: 16.

03:39:06.677 --> 03:39:07.944
MATT: Roll another d100 for me, please.

03:39:07.945 --> 03:39:10.721
LAURA: Oh (laughs) no!
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:39:10.722 --> 03:39:12.361
LAURA: ♪ Covered in hair and also-- ♪

03:39:12.362 --> 03:39:14.092
MATT: Actually no, sorry, sorry, you're fine, you're fine.

03:39:14.093 --> 03:39:14.926
TRAVIS: 16's okay?

03:39:14.927 --> 03:39:16.058
MATT: 16's fine. Sorry.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:39:16.059 --> 03:39:18.761
LIAM: They warned you that you'd get hair on your palms.

03:39:18.762 --> 03:39:21.641
MATT: You just, just missed it.

03:39:21.642 --> 03:39:22.732
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:39:22.733 --> 03:39:24.369
MATT: Essek, however, does have to make a roll.

03:39:24.370 --> 03:39:26.285
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:39:26.286 --> 03:39:28.331
MATT: 16, you guys are fucking lucky.
TRAVIS: Coast clear, cool!

03:39:28.332 --> 03:39:30.912
MATT: Coast's clear, however, that is

03:39:37.252 --> 03:39:40.701
7d4 plus seven points of damage to this thing.

03:39:40.702 --> 03:39:43.341
As Essek floats up a bit in the air,

03:39:43.342 --> 03:39:46.021
and releases his hand like this, and as he does,

03:39:46.022 --> 03:39:48.291
these five darts out of his hand

03:39:48.292 --> 03:39:50.391
and then two out of his palm (whoosh)

03:39:50.392 --> 03:39:53.981
rush around and arc out towards the sides of the hallway

03:39:53.982 --> 03:39:56.691
before all exploding into the center,

03:39:56.692 --> 03:39:57.582
hitting it from all sides.

03:39:57.583 --> 03:39:59.148
And you see this burst of force energy in the middle.

03:39:59.149 --> 03:40:01.094
ASHLEY: Cool.
TRAVIS: Yeah, slow death.

03:40:01.095 --> 03:40:03.439
LIAM: Seven missiles.
MATT: I love that shit.

03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:05.679
ASHLEY: What is it?
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and LIAM: Magic Missile,

03:40:05.680 --> 03:40:06.700
LIAM: It auto-hits.

03:40:06.701 --> 03:40:08.571
MARISHA: Good old classic, yeah.
LIAM: (zooming, explosion)

03:40:08.572 --> 03:40:10.280
TRAVIS: Heat-seeking.
ASHLEY: Good to know.

03:40:11.604 --> 03:40:12.686
TALIESIN: It's the dark side Unibeam.

03:40:12.687 --> 03:40:15.153
LAURA: Didn't you have a wand that could do that?

03:40:15.154 --> 03:40:17.941
SAM: I did, I did.

03:40:17.942 --> 03:40:19.867
Scanlan had a lot of--

03:40:20.833 --> 03:40:23.326
lot of wands.
MATT: Ooh, those are good rolls.

03:40:23.327 --> 03:40:25.743
29 points of force damage to it.

03:40:27.847 --> 03:40:29.897
SAM: Don't we have a Wand of Smiles?

03:40:29.898 --> 03:40:30.930
How come we never use that?
LAURA: I do.

03:40:30.931 --> 03:40:32.029
I have a Wand of Smiles.

03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:33.804
SAM: You should use that more.
MATT: More creatures need to smile.

03:40:33.805 --> 03:40:35.141
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: You're right.

03:40:35.142 --> 03:40:36.678
MATT: All right, and Essek's going to go ahead

03:40:36.679 --> 03:40:38.391
and drift off to this side,

03:40:38.392 --> 03:40:40.011
and try and put more distance between him and the creature,

03:40:40.012 --> 03:40:42.101
while staying within the radius,

03:40:42.102 --> 03:40:43.851
as he drifts back and goes,

03:40:43.852 --> 03:40:45.181
"Caleb, are you all right?"

03:40:45.182 --> 03:40:46.205
LIAM: No.

03:40:47.194 --> 03:40:48.153
MATT: "Me neither."

03:40:48.154 --> 03:40:49.454
TRAVIS: There's another one!

03:40:49.455 --> 03:40:52.151
(laughter)

03:40:52.152 --> 03:40:53.681
MATT: Beau, you're up first. Jester, you're on deck.

03:40:53.682 --> 03:40:55.061
MARISHA: Oh, lordy, it's me?

03:40:55.062 --> 03:40:57.051
Oh, goodness gracious.

03:40:57.052 --> 03:41:01.171
Okay, can I make it to eye-butt monster?

03:41:01.172 --> 03:41:03.411
MATT: Maybe, what's your movement?

03:41:03.412 --> 03:41:04.869
MARISHA: 55.

03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:06.071
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.
ASHLEY: Did you say eye-bud?

03:41:06.072 --> 03:41:07.978
MARISHA: Eye, yeah, yes.

03:41:07.979 --> 03:41:10.513
MATT: You Super Saiyan teleport,

03:41:10.514 --> 03:41:12.221
just (zooming) you're there.

03:41:12.222 --> 03:41:14.037
MARISHA: And I'm going to slide in

03:41:14.038 --> 03:41:15.804
like I'm sliding into home base,

03:41:15.805 --> 03:41:18.071
and then pop-pop, pop-pop!
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god.

03:41:18.072 --> 03:41:18.905
MATT: Go for it.

03:41:19.953 --> 03:41:21.011
TALIESIN: Is that flanked?

03:41:21.012 --> 03:41:22.241
MARISHA: Ooh, oh.

03:41:22.242 --> 03:41:24.101
MATT: Technically that is, yeah, so you'd have advantage.

03:41:24.102 --> 03:41:25.582
MARISHA: Oh, I have advantage?

03:41:25.583 --> 03:41:27.056
MATT: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Oh, thank god.

03:41:27.057 --> 03:41:29.111
Okay, well, this first one's really bad.

03:41:29.112 --> 03:41:31.151
So, 15 total.

03:41:31.152 --> 03:41:33.101
MATT: 15 just hits.

03:41:33.102 --> 03:41:35.562
MARISHA: No fucking way, I rolled a three.

03:41:35.563 --> 03:41:38.484
Okay, fine, great, I'll take it.

03:41:38.485 --> 03:41:40.971
MATT: This creature's AC is not crazy.

03:41:40.972 --> 03:41:42.621
MARISHA: But bad damage roll, too.

03:41:42.622 --> 03:41:45.021
Nine damage, Stunning Strike, though.

03:41:45.022 --> 03:41:46.891
MATT: Nine damage. The one that actually

03:41:46.892 --> 03:41:49.091
has a writing pencil.

03:41:49.092 --> 03:41:51.048
MARISHA: He's got to be close to dead, though, right?

03:41:51.049 --> 03:41:54.455
MATT: Woof! It's 22, I don't know what to tell you.

03:41:54.456 --> 03:41:56.863
I had good luck on that one.

03:41:56.864 --> 03:41:58.731
LIAM: Look at that look.

03:41:58.732 --> 03:42:00.807
MARISHA: Fine, the second hit--

03:42:00.808 --> 03:42:03.126
MATT: Look, look, look, stun is the bane

03:42:03.127 --> 03:42:04.681
of my existence as a DM,

03:42:04.682 --> 03:42:06.466
so whenever it does go, I'm like,

03:42:06.467 --> 03:42:07.951
I have to celebrate a little bit.

03:42:07.952 --> 03:42:08.785
MARISHA: That's good.

03:42:08.786 --> 03:42:10.461
MATT: It shuts my shit down.

03:42:10.462 --> 03:42:11.392
MARISHA: 20 total.

03:42:11.393 --> 03:42:15.226
So that is 13 damage on that next one?

03:42:15.227 --> 03:42:16.387
MATT: 13 damage on the second hit.

03:42:17.332 --> 03:42:18.232
MARISHA: How's he looking?

03:42:19.132 --> 03:42:21.314
MATT: He's looking a little rough,

03:42:21.315 --> 03:42:24.571
starting to show some serious wear and tear.

03:42:24.572 --> 03:42:26.553
MARISHA: All right, all right,

03:42:26.554 --> 03:42:27.597
I'm not going to Stunning Strike.

03:42:27.598 --> 03:42:28.531
MATT: You're not going to Stunning Strike? Okay.

03:42:28.532 --> 03:42:30.391
MARISHA: But I will Flurry of Blows.

03:42:30.392 --> 03:42:31.711
MATT: Go for it.

03:42:31.712 --> 03:42:32.991
MARISHA: Still have advantage, yeah?

03:42:32.992 --> 03:42:33.825
MATT: You do.

03:42:33.826 --> 03:42:38.051
MARISHA: All right, that next one
definitely hits with 30 total.

03:42:38.052 --> 03:42:43.052
And those are both 11s for 23.

03:42:43.482 --> 03:42:45.062
MATT: All righty, that hits.

03:42:46.502 --> 03:42:50.643
MARISHA: So damage for the first one

03:42:50.644 --> 03:42:52.359
is going to be 11,

03:42:52.360 --> 03:42:53.539
and for the second one, 10,

03:42:53.540 --> 03:42:55.695
so 21 altogether for those.

03:42:55.696 --> 03:42:57.731
MATT: Nice, all righty.

03:42:57.732 --> 03:42:59.581
As you slide in, pummeling it from underneath,

03:42:59.582 --> 03:43:01.271
it's starting to bleed onto you,

03:43:01.272 --> 03:43:04.321
that same darker, purple-black blood

03:43:04.322 --> 03:43:06.231
is starting to hit the sides of your abdomen

03:43:06.232 --> 03:43:07.611
as you're just striking it from underneath.

03:43:07.612 --> 03:43:08.801
And you start pulling yourself out,

03:43:08.802 --> 03:43:10.691
and getting ready to get into a defensive position.

03:43:10.692 --> 03:43:11.791
It's looking pretty hurt.

03:43:11.792 --> 03:43:14.051
MARISHA: Do I have any more movement?

03:43:14.052 --> 03:43:15.291
MATT: You would have 10 feet of movement.

03:43:15.292 --> 03:43:20.031
MARISHA: Can I just shift to the
side to get out of people's way?

03:43:20.032 --> 03:43:23.411
So shifting towards-- where am I?

03:43:23.412 --> 03:43:26.811
My perspective is off, like this wall over--

03:43:26.812 --> 03:43:29.266
MATT: Over here?
MARISHA: No, the wall, the wall--

03:43:29.267 --> 03:43:30.540
MATT: Over here?
MARISHA: Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:43:30.541 --> 03:43:32.091
Yeah, in that corner--

03:43:32.092 --> 03:43:33.411
MATT: Right there?
MARISHA: That's fine, that's great.

03:43:33.412 --> 03:43:35.295
TRAVIS: I was starting to think you couldn't hear me.

03:43:35.296 --> 03:43:36.879
Is there something on my face?

03:43:36.880 --> 03:43:39.845
MARISHA: (horrified noises)

03:43:39.846 --> 03:43:40.833
TRAVIS: What do you see?

03:43:40.834 --> 03:43:42.390
MARISHA: Uh--
LAURA: What <i>do</i> you see?

03:43:42.391 --> 03:43:43.461
MATT: You see--
MARISHA: What do I see?

03:43:43.462 --> 03:43:48.462
MATT: -- a bunch of dark hair smattered
across parts of Fjord's face.

03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:51.687
Yeah.
MARISHA: It's a look, it's a look.

03:43:51.688 --> 03:43:53.195
TRAVIS: What?
LIAM: You're finally a werewolf, finally.

03:43:53.196 --> 03:43:55.462
LAURA: Is it, like, long or is it short hair?

03:43:55.463 --> 03:43:58.072
MATT: Like, it looks like short hair.

03:43:58.073 --> 03:43:59.551
LAURA: You're a werewolf!

03:43:59.552 --> 03:44:00.881
MATT: But you don't have a great look at the moment.

03:44:00.882 --> 03:44:02.091
Jester, it's your turn.

03:44:02.092 --> 03:44:04.431
LAURA: I'm going to run forward.

03:44:04.432 --> 03:44:05.799
I'm going to run forward and say:

03:44:05.800 --> 03:44:08.861
I'll save you, Fjord!

03:44:08.862 --> 03:44:12.069
And I can't get all the up to him, probably.

03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.903
MATT: You can get there.

03:44:12.904 --> 03:44:14.771
LAURA: I'm going to chuck my handaxe. (laughs)

03:44:14.772 --> 03:44:16.479
(laughter)

03:44:16.480 --> 03:44:18.418
ASHLEY: Kill him!
MATT: (claps)

03:44:18.419 --> 03:44:20.760
MATT: Roll for an attack.
TRAVIS: Watch out for the lightning!

03:44:20.761 --> 03:44:21.594
LAURA: Gyah!

03:44:21.595 --> 03:44:22.630
Natural 20!

03:44:22.631 --> 03:44:23.514
(cheering)

03:44:23.515 --> 03:44:25.188
MATT: No shit.

03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:27.411
MARISHA: It's Crit Faire, bitches!

03:44:27.412 --> 03:44:28.245
MATT: Straight up.

03:44:28.246 --> 03:44:30.979
(laughter)
TALIESIN: The most ren faire shit.

03:44:30.980 --> 03:44:32.087
MATT: Roll some damage.

03:44:32.088 --> 03:44:35.475
TRAVIS: Make those terrible axes--
LIAM: Huzzah to the big tipper!

03:44:35.476 --> 03:44:36.371
TRAVIS: Huh!

03:44:36.372 --> 03:44:38.272
LAURA: Eight plus three is eleven.

03:44:38.273 --> 03:44:40.057
TRAVIS: Handle first.
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:44:40.058 --> 03:44:41.764
It stuck, though!
LAURA: 22 plus

03:44:41.765 --> 03:44:46.150
four is 26 points of damage to the--

03:44:46.151 --> 03:44:48.968
MATT: How do you want to do this?
(cheering)

03:44:48.969 --> 03:44:50.284
TRAVIS: What are the fucking chances?

03:44:50.285 --> 03:44:52.931
LAURA: I want to imagine that I threw it just perfectly,

03:44:52.932 --> 03:44:55.712
that it cleaves off the eyeball tail.

03:44:55.713 --> 03:44:56.592
MARISHA: Oh, that's good!

03:44:56.593 --> 03:44:59.081
MATT: It does, and the tail just hits the ground.

03:44:59.082 --> 03:45:01.491
And at first you're like, well, let's just a minor wound.

03:45:01.492 --> 03:45:03.771
There is a major artery that connects through this tail,

03:45:03.772 --> 03:45:07.221
and it just begins to gush blood in an uncontrollable way.

03:45:07.222 --> 03:45:11.101
You see, as it turns and growls at you (snarling)

03:45:11.102 --> 03:45:13.091
and starts getting slightly more and more tired

03:45:13.092 --> 03:45:15.571
before it falls unconscious on the path

03:45:15.572 --> 03:45:16.962
to bleeding out here on the floor.

03:45:16.963 --> 03:45:17.796
LIAM: No doggo.

03:45:17.797 --> 03:45:20.898
LAURA: Good night, sweet eyeball-butt monster.

03:45:20.899 --> 03:45:22.761
(laughter)

03:45:22.762 --> 03:45:25.111
MATT: With that, the combat comes to an end,

03:45:25.112 --> 03:45:27.381
and you all take a moment to breathe.

03:45:27.382 --> 03:45:29.051
As I need both Yasha and Jester

03:45:29.052 --> 03:45:30.131
to make dexterity saving throws,

03:45:30.132 --> 03:45:31.381
because you start your next turn

03:45:31.382 --> 03:45:33.419
within the radius of the tower.
MARISHA: Oh.

03:45:33.420 --> 03:45:34.253
LAURA: Yep, yep, yep!

03:45:34.254 --> 03:45:37.851
SAM: Oh.
MARISHA: But-- but I don't?

03:45:37.852 --> 03:45:39.919
MATT: You are just beyond the radius.

03:45:39.920 --> 03:45:41.874
LAURA: N-n-n-n-nineteen!

03:45:41.875 --> 03:45:44.531
MATT: That's a success.
LAURA: 23 total.

03:45:44.532 --> 03:45:48.356
MATT: Nice, you take nine points of lighting damage.

03:45:48.357 --> 03:45:49.431
SAM: Oh.

03:45:49.432 --> 03:45:50.402
ASHLEY: 19 as well.

03:45:50.402 --> 03:45:51.235
MATT: Nine points of lightning damage.

03:45:51.235 --> 03:45:52.068
SAM: Not so bad.

03:45:52.069 --> 03:45:54.781
MATT: As it (shushing) these heavy arcs of lightning

03:45:54.782 --> 03:45:57.361
streak out and hit both of you (shushes) from behind,

03:45:57.362 --> 03:45:59.931
and you both (grunts) catch your breath for a second,

03:45:59.932 --> 03:46:01.841
and you see it pulsing and getting ready for another--

03:46:01.842 --> 03:46:03.604
LIAM: Okay, let's limp out of the way here.

03:46:03.605 --> 03:46:04.485
We don't have much time left.

03:46:04.486 --> 03:46:06.821
LAURA: Move forward, move forward.

03:46:06.822 --> 03:46:07.896
MARISHA: Which hall?

03:46:07.897 --> 03:46:09.528
SAM: Is this some sort of ape creature?

03:46:09.529 --> 03:46:11.651
LAURA: I'm just going to go forward
and try to get out of the--

03:46:11.652 --> 03:46:13.551
LIAM: I'm going towards Caduceus with the staff.
TALIESIN: I'm going to go see what's

03:46:13.552 --> 03:46:15.351
round the other side of this hall.

03:46:15.352 --> 03:46:16.185
MATT: Okay.

03:46:16.186 --> 03:46:18.241
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to make my way to that,

03:46:18.242 --> 03:46:22.345
♪ making my way ♪ to that, where Caduceus is. ♪

03:46:22.346 --> 03:46:23.179
(weird voice) Caduceus.

03:46:23.180 --> 03:46:25.217
MARISHA: (weird voice) Caduceus!
LIAM: (weird voice) I am Caduceus.

03:46:25.218 --> 03:46:26.753
SAM: (weird voice) Hello, my name is Caduceus.

03:46:26.754 --> 03:46:29.061
MATT: The two hallways eventually merge,

03:46:29.062 --> 03:46:31.781
though one is heavily blockaded with rubble

03:46:31.782 --> 03:46:35.671
that could be climbed through with some challenge.

03:46:35.672 --> 03:46:36.891
MARISHA: All right.

03:46:36.892 --> 03:46:37.725
MATT: But nevertheless.

03:46:37.726 --> 03:46:38.861
TALIESIN: I'll hop back in the bubble, then,

03:46:38.862 --> 03:46:40.341
and walk around with everyone else.

03:46:40.342 --> 03:46:42.841
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll walk around.

03:46:42.842 --> 03:46:44.561
LIAM: Okay, and we got to be brisk,

03:46:44.562 --> 03:46:47.811
because we're probably out of time.

03:46:47.812 --> 03:46:49.081
TALIESIN: All right.
MARISHA: Okay.

03:46:49.082 --> 03:46:51.051
Go, go, go, go!
MATT: All right.

03:46:51.052 --> 03:46:53.281
LAURA: I get my handaxe.

03:46:53.282 --> 03:46:54.941
MATT: You retrieve your handaxe without issue.

03:46:54.942 --> 03:46:57.121
LAURA: And I grab the eyeball,

03:46:57.122 --> 03:47:00.111
and I put it in my bag, as a keepsake.

03:47:00.112 --> 03:47:01.171
MATT: The eyeball's pretty big.

03:47:01.172 --> 03:47:02.551
It will not fit into your bag.

03:47:02.552 --> 03:47:03.991
It is about that large.

03:47:03.992 --> 03:47:05.159
LAURA: Whoa!
LIAM: Whoa.

03:47:06.489 --> 03:47:08.987
LAURA: I kick the eyeball.

03:47:08.988 --> 03:47:10.141
TALIESIN: It's like a yoga ball.

03:47:10.142 --> 03:47:13.651
MATT: Yeah, it's soft and your foot

03:47:13.652 --> 03:47:15.671
breaks about an inch or two into it.

03:47:15.672 --> 03:47:17.466
LAURA: (gags)

03:47:17.467 --> 03:47:18.300
Fjord!

03:47:18.301 --> 03:47:19.490
TRAVIS: What's wrong with my face?

03:47:19.491 --> 03:47:21.109
SAM: What is going on?
TRAVIS: Tell me true.

03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:22.134
LIAM: What is this?

03:47:22.135 --> 03:47:23.385
TRAVIS: I don't know!

03:47:24.572 --> 03:47:26.220
SAM: Your eyes have mustaches.

03:47:26.221 --> 03:47:27.621
MARISHA: He looks like he's starting an emo band.

03:47:27.622 --> 03:47:30.581
LAURA: But like, is it-- so is
he just fully covered in hair?

03:47:30.582 --> 03:47:31.415
MATT: No, it's just hair,

03:47:31.416 --> 03:47:33.385
like, matted to his face from the sweat.

03:47:34.732 --> 03:47:36.498
MARISHA: Sweat? Can you wipe it?

03:47:36.499 --> 03:47:37.781
TRAVIS: What?
LIAM: His hair, or--?

03:47:37.782 --> 03:47:39.032
LIAM: Yeah, you wipe it and it comes free,

03:47:39.033 --> 03:47:39.866
and you look, and there's a bunch

03:47:39.866 --> 03:47:40.752
of black hair in your hand.

03:47:40.752 --> 03:47:41.585
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.
LAURA: (gasps)

03:47:41.586 --> 03:47:44.563
MARISHA: Does it grow back though?
TRAVIS: I just-- I start doing this.

03:47:44.564 --> 03:47:46.009
MATT: Yeah, you just start hitting it, and as you do,

03:47:46.010 --> 03:47:47.952
more hair begins to fall out the back of your head.

03:47:47.953 --> 03:47:48.786
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: Oh!

03:47:48.787 --> 03:47:49.901
MATT: You start seeing patches of hair,

03:47:49.902 --> 03:47:51.901
parts of skin showing up throughout the scalp.

03:47:51.902 --> 03:47:53.003
LIAM: Oh.

03:47:53.004 --> 03:47:56.796
SAM: Oh, wait, it's not growing hair.

03:47:56.797 --> 03:47:57.947
It's falling off.
LAURA: He was growing hair--

03:47:59.089 --> 03:48:00.945
Oh no, I was just-- (laughs)

03:48:00.946 --> 03:48:02.478
SAM: Oh no!

03:48:02.479 --> 03:48:03.884
TRAVIS: What about my--?

03:48:03.885 --> 03:48:05.410
LAURA: And everybody's laughing at his--

03:48:05.411 --> 03:48:09.181
TRAVIS: What, wait, hold on, what
about my beard and my ball buns?

03:48:09.182 --> 03:48:10.951
MATT: So at this point, you realize that your beard,

03:48:10.952 --> 03:48:13.956
as you've been doing this, patches have been scraping off.

03:48:13.957 --> 03:48:15.421
TRAVIS: (anguished cry)
LIAM: Oh no.

03:48:15.422 --> 03:48:16.363
MARISHA: What?

03:48:16.364 --> 03:48:17.643
LIAM: What about down below?

03:48:17.644 --> 03:48:19.887
TRAVIS: (groaning)
ASHLEY: No, don't touch anything!

03:48:19.888 --> 03:48:20.721
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:48:20.722 --> 03:48:23.131
ASHLEY: It's all coming off because you're wiping it.

03:48:23.132 --> 03:48:25.251
SAM: But also, it's all coming off.

03:48:25.252 --> 03:48:27.601
ASHLEY: It's going to come off, but just,

03:48:27.602 --> 03:48:29.211
maybe it'll stay if you don't touch it.

03:48:29.212 --> 03:48:30.423
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Fjord.

03:48:30.424 --> 03:48:31.671
SAM: Oh no, do we even know--

03:48:31.672 --> 03:48:33.781
Do you have a good bald head,

03:48:33.782 --> 03:48:36.281
or is it misshapen and weird?
LAURA: It's a perfect bald head!

03:48:36.282 --> 03:48:37.786
SAM: But we-- I've never seen it!

03:48:37.787 --> 03:48:39.001
TRAVIS: Are my eyebrows still?

03:48:39.002 --> 03:48:41.658
LIAM: It's all or nothing, Yasha, oh dear.
LAURA: Did he lose his eyebrows?

03:48:41.659 --> 03:48:43.771
ASHLEY: Oh, well, at this point you should just--

03:48:43.772 --> 03:48:44.801
MATT: You don't know.

03:48:44.802 --> 03:48:45.961
MARISHA: They're patchy.

03:48:45.962 --> 03:48:47.681
TRAVIS: Don't touch it!
(laughter)

03:48:47.682 --> 03:48:48.658
SAM: I'm going to touch his eyebrows.

03:48:48.659 --> 03:48:50.336
TRAVIS: (shrieking) Don't you fucking--!

03:48:50.337 --> 03:48:51.170
SAM: Mage Hand!

03:48:51.171 --> 03:48:52.240
TRAVIS: Armor of Agathys!

03:48:52.241 --> 03:48:54.956
(laughter)

03:48:54.957 --> 03:48:56.600
MATT: Do you Mage Hand?

03:48:56.601 --> 03:48:58.338
SAM: Mage Hand!
(laughter)

03:48:58.339 --> 03:48:59.292
MATT: All right, and you rub an eyebrow?

03:48:59.293 --> 03:49:01.301
SAM: I just want to-- yeah, just like a (pop).

03:49:01.302 --> 03:49:03.271
MATT: It leaves a mark. The hair is gone where you--

03:49:03.272 --> 03:49:05.803
(shouting, laughter)

03:49:05.804 --> 03:49:06.834
TRAVIS: How could you!?

03:49:06.835 --> 03:49:08.500
SAM: I had to know! (laughs)

03:49:08.501 --> 03:49:10.001
ASHLEY: Well, maybe you should just get rid of all of it.

03:49:10.002 --> 03:49:11.297
TRAVIS: I've only got one!

03:49:11.298 --> 03:49:12.401
(screech) there goes the other one.

03:49:12.402 --> 03:49:14.311
LIAM: Oh!
MARISHA: Oh no!

03:49:14.312 --> 03:49:15.312
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

03:49:15.313 --> 03:49:16.860
SAM: Oh no, you're like one of those,

03:49:16.861 --> 03:49:19.775
those faces with magnets, and like--

03:49:19.776 --> 03:49:20.667
TRAVIS: Uh-huh?

03:49:20.668 --> 03:49:21.941
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, the Mr. Woolies?

03:49:21.942 --> 03:49:22.775
SAM: Yeah.

03:49:22.776 --> 03:49:24.491
MATT: A classic Zemnian toy.

03:49:24.492 --> 03:49:25.884
TRAVIS: We should keep going!

03:49:25.885 --> 03:49:27.691
LAURA: Hey, you don't need hair, Fjord, don't worry.

03:49:27.692 --> 03:49:28.525
SAM: This is horrible.

03:49:28.526 --> 03:49:30.671
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe it'll wear off, in time.

03:49:30.672 --> 03:49:31.505
TRAVIS: It's just hair.

03:49:31.506 --> 03:49:33.684
ASHLEY: I mean, it'll all wear off, it seems like.

03:49:33.685 --> 03:49:35.591
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:49:35.592 --> 03:49:38.808
LAURA: Oh, but it'll come back.

03:49:38.809 --> 03:49:40.071
TRAVIS: Will it!?

03:49:40.072 --> 03:49:41.815
ASHLEY: Yes, hair grows.

03:49:43.532 --> 03:49:45.441
TALIESIN: I'm sure we can figure this out.

03:49:45.442 --> 03:49:48.610
TRAVIS: Yep, I'm sure, let's go onward.

03:49:48.611 --> 03:49:50.221
TALIESIN: We should find a place to sleep.

03:49:50.222 --> 03:49:51.799
TRAVIS: Are there any blood-- is there-- what--

03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:53.041
the trail that we followed in here,

03:49:53.042 --> 03:49:54.731
do we see anything on the floor?

03:49:54.732 --> 03:49:56.901
MATT: There's all sorts of blood, your own--

03:49:56.902 --> 03:49:57.885
TRAVIS: Fuck!

03:49:57.886 --> 03:49:58.951
ASHLEY: I have an idea!

03:49:58.952 --> 03:50:00.617
TRAVIS: What?
ASHLEY: I could cut some of my hair,

03:50:00.618 --> 03:50:02.901
and then we could use the sovereign glue,

03:50:02.902 --> 03:50:04.051
and put it on your head!

03:50:04.052 --> 03:50:05.971
SAM: Ooh, the sovereign glue will keep it!

03:50:05.972 --> 03:50:08.221
ASHLEY: It'll keep it on there forever.

03:50:08.222 --> 03:50:09.565
MARISHA: So it could be like a salt and pepper thing.

03:50:09.566 --> 03:50:10.591
LAURA: I don't--

03:50:10.592 --> 03:50:12.288
TRAVIS: Maybe we keep that as a last resort.

03:50:12.289 --> 03:50:13.778
ASHLEY: Maybe we should go, this is a bad time--

03:50:13.779 --> 03:50:15.644
LIAM: Let's just sleep on it.
LAURA: Yasha, may just

03:50:15.645 --> 03:50:17.160
stand next to him, and put your hair over,

03:50:17.161 --> 03:50:18.370
so I can picture what it would look like.

03:50:18.371 --> 03:50:20.731
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes, I will.

03:50:20.732 --> 03:50:22.371
I'll stand above him and put then my hair--

03:50:22.372 --> 03:50:24.981
SAM: When we were at Rexxentrum a long time ago,

03:50:24.982 --> 03:50:26.101
I gave you all hats.

03:50:26.102 --> 03:50:28.024
Did any of you keep any of them?

03:50:28.025 --> 03:50:28.858
ASHLEY: I did.

03:50:28.859 --> 03:50:32.271
SAM: Okay, you had a yellow beanie.

03:50:32.272 --> 03:50:33.381
Could you give it to Fjord?

03:50:33.382 --> 03:50:35.231
TRAVIS: I have a tricorn, okay?

03:50:35.232 --> 03:50:37.529
It's fine. I put it on.

03:50:37.530 --> 03:50:38.871
(laughter)

03:50:38.872 --> 03:50:41.576
Totally, it's fine! (cries)

03:50:41.577 --> 03:50:44.146
ASHLEY: You look tough without eyebrows.

03:50:44.147 --> 03:50:45.479
LIAM: Oh.
ASHLEY: It's very--

03:50:45.480 --> 03:50:48.199
TRAVIS: You can't even see if I'm furrowing my brow!

03:50:48.200 --> 03:50:49.158
SAM: Are you sad or mad?

03:50:49.158 --> 03:50:50.158
TRAVIS: I'm closing my eyes!

03:50:50.159 --> 03:50:52.233
LAURA: Oh, you know, I could tattoo them on for you.

03:50:52.234 --> 03:50:54.131
SAM: Oh, she can use her paints!

03:50:54.132 --> 03:50:55.072
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:50:55.073 --> 03:50:56.111
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

03:50:56.112 --> 03:50:57.831
LAURA: I can magically paint some eyebrows.

03:50:57.832 --> 03:50:58.665
MARISHA: With a Sharpie.

03:50:58.666 --> 03:51:00.571
TRAVIS: Going.
LAURA: Okay.

03:51:00.572 --> 03:51:02.611
We'll keep going, we'll keep going.

03:51:02.612 --> 03:51:04.171
LIAM: That's going to look like Rip Torn.

03:51:04.172 --> 03:51:06.115
SAM: Every time he changes his expression,

03:51:06.116 --> 03:51:11.116
you'll have to like go in, and like erase it, and redraw it.

03:51:12.312 --> 03:51:13.711
TRAVIS: I think this is a great look.

03:51:13.712 --> 03:51:16.121
I think I look smooth.
LIAM: You look fantastic.

03:51:16.122 --> 03:51:17.161
LAURA: You look really great.

03:51:17.162 --> 03:51:19.177
TRAVIS: I just get all of it. I just do all of it.

03:51:19.178 --> 03:51:21.244
Instead of the patchy. All of it.
MATT: It all comes off.

03:51:21.245 --> 03:51:23.831
MATT: You are completely bald.

03:51:23.832 --> 03:51:25.206
TRAVIS: Awesome.

03:51:25.207 --> 03:51:27.981
MATT: Eyebrows, beard, hair, you are just a smooth Fjord.

03:51:27.982 --> 03:51:29.631
TRAVIS: You know what, it looks good.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:51:29.632 --> 03:51:31.054
LAURA: I'm trying to picture it. (laughs)

03:51:31.055 --> 03:51:33.011
LIAM: You're even more--
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm deep.

03:51:33.012 --> 03:51:33.953
LIAM: More fit for the water.
MARISHA: Yeah, for the water.

03:51:33.954 --> 03:51:35.541
Yeah, you're like--
LAURA: Oh yeah.

03:51:35.542 --> 03:51:37.361
MARISHA: -- just full swimmer--

03:51:37.362 --> 03:51:38.972
TRAVIS: Olympic swimmer.

03:51:38.973 --> 03:51:40.371
LIAM: Fate of the world and all that.

03:51:40.372 --> 03:51:42.712
TRAVIS: Yes, let's go.
LIAM: If this is the worst that happens--

03:51:42.713 --> 03:51:43.851
MARISHA: Not too bad.

03:51:43.852 --> 03:51:45.838
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

03:51:45.839 --> 03:51:48.778
LAURA: I think, I think, I think it looks good.

03:51:48.779 --> 03:51:49.612
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:51:49.613 --> 03:51:51.661
TALIESIN: I don't suppose there's anything in this furniture

03:51:51.662 --> 03:51:55.061
that's just lying here. Is it all just kind of--?

03:51:55.062 --> 03:51:57.535
TRAVIS: When we ran in, did we see what that was?

03:51:58.942 --> 03:52:00.091
MATT: Which one, the?

03:52:00.092 --> 03:52:02.161
LAURA: These, like--
MATT: Oh.

03:52:02.162 --> 03:52:04.791
So those, those--
TRAVIS: Is that a fireplace?

03:52:04.792 --> 03:52:07.311
MATT: I mean, the piece I'm using is a fireplace,

03:52:07.312 --> 03:52:10.391
but the present location you're at,

03:52:10.392 --> 03:52:13.171
it looks like storage chambers

03:52:13.172 --> 03:52:14.741
that are just left open.

03:52:14.742 --> 03:52:15.575
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:52:15.576 --> 03:52:17.457
TRAVIS: It didn't look like a passageway or like a door?

03:52:17.458 --> 03:52:18.432
MATT: You can make an investigation check

03:52:18.433 --> 03:52:19.781
to see if there's anything beyond it.

03:52:19.782 --> 03:52:22.449
TRAVIS: I sure want to walk by the lightning thing again.

03:52:23.942 --> 03:52:25.955
LAURA: I'm already out here. I'll go check.

03:52:27.972 --> 03:52:29.101
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Or we've already moved.

03:52:29.102 --> 03:52:30.380
Have we moved?

03:52:30.381 --> 03:52:32.525
MATT: Correct, yeah, and the orb has vanished.

03:52:34.522 --> 03:52:37.321
TRAVIS: Yeah, so you'll just take
a shot every time you walk by.

03:52:37.322 --> 03:52:39.329
LAURA: Oh, well.

03:52:39.330 --> 03:52:40.163
TRAVIS: Every six seconds.
LAURA: What about the one

03:52:40.164 --> 03:52:41.663
inside the hallway, is that--?

03:52:42.762 --> 03:52:43.861
MATT: You can make an investigation check

03:52:43.862 --> 03:52:46.011
on that as well, if you'd like.

03:52:49.613 --> 03:52:51.586
TRAVIS: (laughs) Heartburn.

03:52:51.587 --> 03:52:55.871
LAURA: (laughs) 19, oh, I didn't-- no, that's not what I rolled,

03:52:55.872 --> 03:52:57.061
I just was pushing the--

03:52:57.062 --> 03:52:58.984
Wow, this is so cool.
LAURA: You rolled a nature check?

03:52:58.985 --> 03:53:02.261
LAURA: I rolled a nature check anyway, but that's not--

03:53:02.262 --> 03:53:04.621
I was looking at the investigation.

03:53:04.622 --> 03:53:09.521
I rolled 19, 14 plus four, plus one, 19.

03:53:09.522 --> 03:53:12.599
MATT: Okay, as far as you can tell,

03:53:13.642 --> 03:53:16.821
there are sliding storage doors

03:53:16.822 --> 03:53:19.572
and shelves within here, though most of them are empty.

03:53:21.422 --> 03:53:23.011
Kind of looking around the hallway above,

03:53:23.012 --> 03:53:24.741
you do see a number of other corpses

03:53:24.742 --> 03:53:26.131
that were in the process of running,

03:53:26.132 --> 03:53:30.065
and in the collapse, they seem to have been ruined and left.

03:53:30.952 --> 03:53:34.291
You see broken pots and containers,

03:53:34.292 --> 03:53:36.331
things that may have been either in the process

03:53:36.332 --> 03:53:38.591
of being looted or carried through this space

03:53:38.592 --> 03:53:40.361
before the impact.

03:53:40.362 --> 03:53:42.310
But it is mostly empty.
LAURA: Okay.

03:53:44.312 --> 03:53:45.561
Just keep going, then?

03:53:45.562 --> 03:53:47.887
TALIESIN: Let's find a place to--

03:53:48.953 --> 03:53:50.511
LAURA: Stop?
TALIESIN: Stop.

03:53:50.512 --> 03:53:52.551
LAURA: (laughs)

03:53:52.552 --> 03:53:54.221
LAURA: This is so cool.

03:53:54.222 --> 03:53:56.573
SAM: I know, we're just playing with D&amp;D Beyond now.

03:53:56.574 --> 03:53:58.355
MARISHA: They're really good rolls that are coming--

03:53:58.356 --> 03:54:00.341
LIAM: I made a religion check on nothing.

03:54:00.342 --> 03:54:02.631
Cheers.
(laughter)

03:54:02.632 --> 03:54:04.495
MATT: So what are you doing?
MARISHA: Ooh, ooh.

03:54:04.496 --> 03:54:05.736
TALIESIN: Terrible, man.

03:54:05.737 --> 03:54:07.271
SAM: We're going to keep going down the hall.

03:54:07.272 --> 03:54:08.105
LIAM: Are we?

03:54:08.106 --> 03:54:10.291
I'm a mess, I'm bleeding out my eyes right now.

03:54:10.292 --> 03:54:12.052
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: I'm dead.

03:54:12.053 --> 03:54:13.331
SAM: Is this a good place to stop?

03:54:13.332 --> 03:54:15.591
I mean, we have the hallways in front of us

03:54:15.592 --> 03:54:16.901
and behind us, and--

03:54:16.902 --> 03:54:19.231
MARISHA: I know, is this a good place?

03:54:19.232 --> 03:54:21.451
TALIESIN: I think right in this
corner, we make a little dome.

03:54:21.452 --> 03:54:22.491
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah,

03:54:22.492 --> 03:54:25.401
and block the passageway in both directions.

03:54:25.402 --> 03:54:26.382
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: That's true.

03:54:26.383 --> 03:54:29.261
TALIESIN: Actually, if we make it in that little corner,

03:54:29.262 --> 03:54:30.761
then maybe it blocks all three.

03:54:30.762 --> 03:54:33.881
MARISHA: You're talking about this corner?

03:54:33.882 --> 03:54:34.967
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:54:34.968 --> 03:54:35.829
MARISHA: You kind of--

03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:37.521
TALIESIN: I see where you're going.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:54:37.522 --> 03:54:38.705
Okay, yeah.

03:54:39.542 --> 03:54:40.375
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

03:54:40.376 --> 03:54:41.721
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay, all right,

03:54:41.722 --> 03:54:45.541
I'll pull my book out, and just plop on my butt hard.

03:54:45.542 --> 03:54:47.346
MATT: You're setting up around here, you said?

03:54:47.347 --> 03:54:48.621
LIAM: No.
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no.

03:54:48.622 --> 03:54:50.033
MATT: Oh, over here.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:54:50.034 --> 03:54:51.341
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: There we go.

03:54:51.342 --> 03:54:54.251
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Look, it's a perfect fit.

03:54:54.252 --> 03:54:55.460
MATT: All righty.

03:54:57.162 --> 03:54:57.995
TALIESIN: How close were you?
TRAVIS: I will stand as a

03:54:57.996 --> 03:55:00.877
svelte sentry as Caleb is-- (laughs)

03:55:00.878 --> 03:55:01.823
TALIESIN: How close were you?

03:55:01.824 --> 03:55:03.251
LIAM: Oh, 21 hit points.

03:55:03.252 --> 03:55:04.085
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:55:05.862 --> 03:55:08.631
You would've popped up at zero at least, so.

03:55:08.632 --> 03:55:09.465
LAURA: That's true.

03:55:09.466 --> 03:55:10.531
ASHLEY: Can we see anything down that hall

03:55:10.532 --> 03:55:12.201
that we haven't gone down?

03:55:12.202 --> 03:55:13.692
Just to get a little peeksy?

03:55:13.693 --> 03:55:15.332
MATT: From where you're standing, make a perception check.

03:55:15.333 --> 03:55:16.420
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:55:16.421 --> 03:55:18.621
LIAM: Yeah, you can go in and out.

03:55:23.232 --> 03:55:24.501
ASHLEY: 22.

03:55:24.502 --> 03:55:25.610
MATT: Pretty good.

03:55:26.532 --> 03:55:29.591
About 50 or so feet beyond, the hall continues,

03:55:29.592 --> 03:55:30.701
and then you see what looks to be

03:55:30.702 --> 03:55:33.971
a set of heavy brass-like doors.

03:55:33.972 --> 03:55:38.631
They are both closed, but one seems slightly off its hinges.

03:55:38.632 --> 03:55:40.001
There's a slight gap beyond it

03:55:40.002 --> 03:55:41.502
where you can see some shadow.

03:55:42.642 --> 03:55:43.475
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:55:47.041 --> 03:55:50.201
This feels like a pretty terrible spot,

03:55:50.202 --> 03:55:52.115
but it's what we have.
(laughter)

03:55:52.116 --> 03:55:53.514
TRAVIS: What?

03:55:53.515 --> 03:55:58.321
ASHLEY: This is a spot with many
openings, but we'll be okay.

03:55:58.322 --> 03:56:01.661
TALIESIN: Charlie, do you know
what's beyond those doors there?

03:56:01.662 --> 03:56:04.538
MATT: "I imagine beyond this space is the Genesis Ward."

03:56:07.721 --> 03:56:08.554
LAURA: All right.

03:56:08.555 --> 03:56:11.304
TALIESIN: The question is, do we spend this time long rest--

03:56:11.305 --> 03:56:12.288
Ah, nope, nevermind.

03:56:12.289 --> 03:56:14.631
LAURA: We sleep.
TALIESIN: Terrible idea, we sleep.

03:56:14.632 --> 03:56:16.851
LAURA: We need to sleep.

03:56:16.852 --> 03:56:19.571
Before we go to sleep, if we get a full rest,

03:56:19.572 --> 03:56:23.041
I'm actually going to use my last fifth level,

03:56:23.042 --> 03:56:25.901
and Scry, yeah?

03:56:25.902 --> 03:56:29.299
I'm going to try to Scry on Cree.

03:56:29.300 --> 03:56:30.911
MATT: On Cree, okay.

03:56:30.912 --> 03:56:33.650
SAM: She's sharpening her blades.

03:56:33.651 --> 03:56:35.433
LAURA: Oh! (burbles)

03:56:35.434 --> 03:56:38.916
Yeah, Guide me, Guide me, before-- help me!

03:56:38.917 --> 03:56:40.382
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:56:40.383 --> 03:56:41.641
Bip.

03:56:42.890 --> 03:56:43.723
LAURA: Thanks.

03:56:55.992 --> 03:56:57.741
MATT: You feel that familiar whisper

03:56:57.742 --> 03:57:00.345
creep up into your left ear.

03:57:02.292 --> 03:57:03.125
Close.

03:57:05.852 --> 03:57:08.985
"So, what is it you're wanting, my dear?"

03:57:08.986 --> 03:57:10.311
LAURA: I want to Scry on Cree.

03:57:10.312 --> 03:57:13.981
I want to see if they're hurt, if they're resting,

03:57:13.982 --> 03:57:17.711
if they're already, you know, going to the astral plane.

03:57:17.712 --> 03:57:19.162
I don't know what's going on.

03:57:20.029 --> 03:57:22.241
MATT: "Oh, let's go have a look, shall we?"

03:57:22.242 --> 03:57:23.371
LAURA: Okay.

03:57:23.372 --> 03:57:25.091
MATT: "I'm kind of curious myself.

03:57:25.092 --> 03:57:26.999
"They're a bit of a...

03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:28.765
"bunch of punks, aren't they?"

03:57:28.766 --> 03:57:30.421
LAURA: Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:57:30.422 --> 03:57:33.401
Look over there, there's a giant eyeball on the ground.

03:57:33.402 --> 03:57:35.302
MATT: "That's fucking weird."
LAURA: I know.

03:57:35.303 --> 03:57:38.220
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:57:39.649 --> 03:57:43.471
MATT: With that, while you haven't seen Artie,

03:57:43.472 --> 03:57:45.551
just sensing his presence is comforting.

03:57:45.552 --> 03:57:48.221
LAURA: Do I need to roll a natural-- a 20,

03:57:48.222 --> 03:57:50.251
before I do this spell, or--?

03:57:50.252 --> 03:57:52.781
MATT: No, the spell is a saving throw on their end.

03:57:52.782 --> 03:57:54.701
LAURA: Oh, I mean for the wild magic.

03:57:54.702 --> 03:57:55.944
MATT: Oh yes, you do.

03:57:59.392 --> 03:58:00.225
LAURA: Nine.

03:58:00.226 --> 03:58:01.461
MATT: Okay, you're fine.

03:58:01.462 --> 03:58:03.109
LIAM: Your hair is safe.

03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:05.701
LAURA: (laughs) No! Oh, I could've lost all my hair, too--

03:58:05.702 --> 03:58:06.961
MATT: This is a long table,

03:58:06.962 --> 03:58:09.111
so there's all sorts of weird shit that can happen.

03:58:09.112 --> 03:58:09.945
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:58:09.946 --> 03:58:12.131
MATT: Some of it real bad. (laughs)

03:58:12.132 --> 03:58:13.262
You got off easy.

03:58:15.145 --> 03:58:16.168
(laughter)

03:58:16.169 --> 03:58:17.002
TALIESIN: (squeaking noises)

03:58:17.003 --> 03:58:18.391
TRAVIS: I like it.
TALIESIN: (squeak squeak)

03:58:18.392 --> 03:58:20.641
SAM: Fjord Contour.

03:58:20.642 --> 03:58:22.421
MATT: All righty.

03:58:22.422 --> 03:58:26.072
So, with that, you feel Artie's...

03:58:27.255 --> 03:58:30.712
ethereal fey hands reach out and touch your temples.

03:58:30.713 --> 03:58:33.081
And as you close your eyes, you feel like you're being

03:58:33.082 --> 03:58:36.021
lifted out of your own body for a moment.

03:58:36.022 --> 03:58:39.542
There's that sense of butterfly, it's in this drifting,

03:58:39.543 --> 03:58:42.281
and you hear the splashing of water.

03:58:43.352 --> 03:58:44.901
It's odd.

03:58:44.902 --> 03:58:47.585
You've seen no water here.

03:58:50.252 --> 03:58:55.252
You see flashes of dots of green light in darkness.

03:58:55.362 --> 03:58:58.965
Familiar, based on previous travel through the ward.

03:59:00.982 --> 03:59:03.197
And you're suddenly brought

03:59:03.198 --> 03:59:06.806
to a small blue orb.

03:59:08.062 --> 03:59:10.331
I say small, it's about this big.

03:59:10.332 --> 03:59:12.721
It is one of the threshold crests

03:59:12.722 --> 03:59:15.391
that is currently set on the ground,

03:59:15.392 --> 03:59:18.491
and you see some bags,

03:59:18.492 --> 03:59:21.282
and you see sitting on two sides

03:59:21.283 --> 03:59:24.423
of the threshold crest

03:59:24.424 --> 03:59:28.675
on the ground, Cree, and just at the periphery,

03:59:29.772 --> 03:59:32.305
what you assume to be Lucien.

03:59:33.432 --> 03:59:34.832
They're both drinking water,

03:59:35.992 --> 03:59:39.161
and there's just a bit of quiet.

03:59:39.162 --> 03:59:40.445
Make a perception check.

03:59:48.357 --> 03:59:49.781
LAURA: 18.

03:59:49.782 --> 03:59:53.201
MATT: Okay, glancing at the fringes,

03:59:53.202 --> 03:59:57.571
the fuzzy blurred edges of the Scry radius,

03:59:57.572 --> 04:00:00.635
you can definitely make out the form of Lucien.

04:00:02.112 --> 04:00:05.591
They're both in the process of pulling out bandages,

04:00:05.592 --> 04:00:08.411
and wrapping themselves up to a degree,

04:00:08.412 --> 04:00:10.791
before Lucien begins sharpening the edge

04:00:10.792 --> 04:00:12.909
of one of the blades that he carries.

04:00:15.069 --> 04:00:16.002
LAURA: (laughs)

04:00:16.002 --> 04:00:16.925
SAM: Cree's blade?

04:00:18.174 --> 04:00:20.171
TRAVIS: He's so considerate.

04:00:20.172 --> 04:00:21.197
SAM: They're a team.

04:00:22.852 --> 04:00:24.935
MATT: Before Cree goes,

04:00:28.910 --> 04:00:30.610
"We have to be close, yes?

04:00:32.372 --> 04:00:34.827
"Everything we've given, we have to be close."

04:00:36.255 --> 04:00:38.422
There's another pause before Lucien goes,

04:00:40.242 --> 04:00:44.895
"Don't worry, we're getting there. I can feel it.

04:00:47.122 --> 04:00:51.671
"But they're close now, too, the wee babes,

04:00:51.672 --> 04:00:53.539
"lost without their king.

04:00:55.402 --> 04:00:59.368
"Endless hunger, limitless potential,

04:01:01.292 --> 04:01:05.161
"without focus, divided among thousands

04:01:05.162 --> 04:01:08.477
"of mewling fragmented minds.

04:01:10.202 --> 04:01:12.515
"The Nonagon saw this in them.

04:01:14.624 --> 04:01:16.363
"And I'll be reborn greater.

04:01:20.442 --> 04:01:22.459
"I am their savior, as they were mine.

04:01:23.882 --> 04:01:25.532
"I will save them from their pain,

04:01:26.742 --> 04:01:28.892
"from their wasteful existence.

04:01:31.342 --> 04:01:34.725
"And you're to join me there, in their memory."

04:01:36.112 --> 04:01:37.362
Cree goes,

04:01:38.270 --> 04:01:40.770
"Aye, in their memory."

04:01:43.659 --> 04:01:45.359
And she takes a bite of something.

04:01:49.855 --> 04:01:51.530
And they're just quiet.

04:01:53.532 --> 04:01:55.145
Cree looks beat up.

04:01:57.943 --> 04:01:59.631
LAURA: What about Lucien?

04:01:59.632 --> 04:02:02.295
MATT: You can't make out too much of the details around him,

04:02:03.372 --> 04:02:05.741
but he-- at one point early on,

04:02:05.742 --> 04:02:08.461
you did see him finish bandaging himself,

04:02:08.462 --> 04:02:09.925
around, like, a forearm,

04:02:11.462 --> 04:02:14.925
before he went to start sharpening his blade.

04:02:15.792 --> 04:02:18.121
So they're taking a little bit of a beating.

04:02:18.122 --> 04:02:20.421
LAURA: They're around water?

04:02:20.422 --> 04:02:22.791
MATT: You heard water.
LAURA: Okay.

04:02:22.792 --> 04:02:24.211
MATT: You don't know what that means.

04:02:24.212 --> 04:02:26.362
LAURA: And what can I see around them, anything?

04:02:27.812 --> 04:02:29.525
MATT: Best you can tell...

04:02:32.162 --> 04:02:33.402
it's interesting.

04:02:34.952 --> 04:02:37.731
They're not sitting on cobblestone.

04:02:37.732 --> 04:02:41.712
They're not sitting on rough floor or tile.

04:02:43.792 --> 04:02:47.358
They're not sitting in city rubble.

04:02:48.782 --> 04:02:53.782
They're sitting on smooth marble floor,

04:02:56.652 --> 04:02:59.551
with a faint, dull yellowish orange hue

04:02:59.552 --> 04:03:01.152
to the space around them.

04:03:03.022 --> 04:03:04.547
It reminds you a little bit,

04:03:06.022 --> 04:03:11.022
in some ways of the atmosphere of the laboratory,

04:03:11.262 --> 04:03:12.361
shortly after you had fought

04:03:12.362 --> 04:03:15.495
that terrible baby-like abomination.

04:03:16.772 --> 04:03:20.931
It feels industrious, professional,

04:03:20.932 --> 04:03:24.511
strangely clean against the surface rubble

04:03:24.512 --> 04:03:27.588
that you've been wallowing through since your arrival.

04:03:34.558 --> 04:03:35.391
LAURA: Okay.

04:03:37.672 --> 04:03:41.295
MATT: Before the spell ends, you hear Lucien go,

04:03:43.340 --> 04:03:48.340
"Ah, I'm sure there's certain little joyful gifts

04:03:48.502 --> 04:03:50.031
"to find around here.

04:03:50.032 --> 04:03:55.025
"These people were quite creative in their magical pursuits.

04:03:56.892 --> 04:03:57.725
"Maybe we'll find something

04:03:57.726 --> 04:04:00.867
"that can patch us up right quicker.

04:04:05.132 --> 04:04:06.183
"Let's get some shuteye.

04:04:06.184 --> 04:04:08.271
"Well, you.

04:04:08.272 --> 04:04:09.705
"I'll keep an eye out."

04:04:11.302 --> 04:04:14.991
He leans a little further out of the blurry range,

04:04:14.992 --> 04:04:16.081
as Cree takes a moment,

04:04:16.082 --> 04:04:19.935
and takes a final bite of some sort of dry tack,

04:04:20.992 --> 04:04:23.795
before curling into a little cat ball on the floor.

04:04:26.312 --> 04:04:29.232
And (whoosh), you're pulled out of your Scry.

04:04:32.512 --> 04:04:33.642
LAURA: They're resting.

04:04:36.462 --> 04:04:38.044
LIAM: How did they sound?

04:04:38.045 --> 04:04:39.761
LAURA: A little beat up.

04:04:39.762 --> 04:04:41.271
LIAM: Both?

04:04:41.272 --> 04:04:44.165
LAURA: Cree was. Cree sounded disheartened.

04:04:45.795 --> 04:04:47.412
Lucien sounded like himself.

04:04:49.022 --> 04:04:50.471
It almost seemed like he was performing.

04:04:50.472 --> 04:04:52.387
I think he knew I was watching.

04:04:55.992 --> 04:04:57.311
SAM: Well, that's good, they're resting,

04:04:57.312 --> 04:05:00.371
that means that we can rest as well, right?

04:05:00.372 --> 04:05:01.401
LAURA: Yeah.

04:05:01.402 --> 04:05:05.480
TRAVIS: Did they look like they
were in a place similar to ours?

04:05:05.481 --> 04:05:07.780
LAURA: It was clean, it looked
like one of those laboratories.

04:05:07.781 --> 04:05:11.019
I heard water. There was a yellow glow.

04:05:12.512 --> 04:05:13.345
Maybe...

04:05:16.662 --> 04:05:20.201
maybe if we come across it, we'll know how far away we are.

04:05:20.202 --> 04:05:21.802
He said they were getting close.

04:05:23.912 --> 04:05:26.262
He said he was going to be their savior.

04:05:28.770 --> 04:05:31.585
He kept saying "the wee babes."

04:05:36.062 --> 04:05:38.129
SAM: Does he mean us or the whole world?

04:05:40.098 --> 04:05:41.056
LAURA: I don't know.

04:05:41.057 --> 04:05:44.683
I don't know if he meant Caleb and Beau with their new eyes.

04:05:51.792 --> 04:05:53.821
I tell them everything else that I heard.

04:05:53.822 --> 04:05:55.963
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we get one more night of sleep,

04:05:55.964 --> 04:05:58.279
don't we?
LIAM: Yeah.

04:05:58.280 --> 04:06:02.596
Side note, did I-- when she cast Scry,

04:06:02.597 --> 04:06:05.312
did I see the same thing I saw when I was a giant ape?

04:06:06.582 --> 04:06:08.413
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Okay.

04:06:08.414 --> 04:06:09.924
LAURA: What, what?

04:06:10.937 --> 04:06:12.479
LIAM: Don't worry about it.

04:06:14.025 --> 04:06:15.541
SAM: What, what?

04:06:17.612 --> 04:06:19.014
TRAVIS: Secret secrets.

04:06:19.015 --> 04:06:20.601
LAURA: Secret secrets aren't fun.

04:06:20.602 --> 04:06:21.791
SAM: Secrets.

04:06:21.792 --> 04:06:23.871
ASHLEY: Secrets don't make friends.

04:06:23.872 --> 04:06:25.421
SAM: Boo-crets.

04:06:25.422 --> 04:06:28.028
MATT: So, are you all resting?

04:06:28.029 --> 04:06:29.389
LAURA: I guess so?
SAM: I think so.

04:06:29.390 --> 04:06:30.223
LAURA: We need it.

04:06:30.224 --> 04:06:32.551
SAM: Do we need to do watch, lookouts?

04:06:32.552 --> 04:06:34.351
LIAM: Yeah.

04:06:34.352 --> 04:06:35.911
SAM: Okay.

04:06:35.912 --> 04:06:36.745
TALIESIN: I mean, we're in the dome,

04:06:36.746 --> 04:06:38.281
we're in the dome, but.

04:06:38.282 --> 04:06:39.411
MATT: Who's taking first watch?

04:06:39.412 --> 04:06:41.315
ASHLEY: I'll take first watch.
SAM: Charlie.

04:06:42.434 --> 04:06:43.267
TRAVIS: No Charlie, no.

04:06:43.268 --> 04:06:46.741
ASHLEY: I'll take first watch.
(laughter)

04:06:46.742 --> 04:06:48.691
MATT: "I could use the rest."

04:06:48.692 --> 04:06:50.871
LAURA: Oh, okay, cuddle up with me, Charlie.

04:06:50.872 --> 04:06:52.631
We're going to sleep.

04:06:52.632 --> 04:06:54.801
MATT: "All right."
TRAVIS: Should someone join you?

04:06:54.802 --> 04:06:55.635
ASHLEY: Sure.

04:06:55.636 --> 04:06:57.235
TRAVIS: I'll do it.
TALIESIN: You got it.

04:06:58.152 --> 04:06:59.511
LAURA: (snores)

04:06:59.512 --> 04:07:01.471
MATT: All right, so Fjord and Yasha are taking first watch.

04:07:01.472 --> 04:07:02.801
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:07:02.802 --> 04:07:03.635
MATT: All right.

04:07:05.004 --> 04:07:07.391
All of you eventually find a...

04:07:07.392 --> 04:07:08.441
as comfortable in a crowded space

04:07:08.442 --> 04:07:09.905
as the dome always provides.

04:07:11.952 --> 04:07:15.055
Finally, exhausted, muscles sore,

04:07:16.762 --> 04:07:21.762
still processing the events of the past day or two,

04:07:21.872 --> 04:07:23.221
who knows how long it's been?

04:07:23.222 --> 04:07:24.351
It's lightless down here.

04:07:24.352 --> 04:07:28.181
You have, aside from Caleb, little sense of passage of time.

04:07:28.182 --> 04:07:29.682
That fucking feat.

04:07:33.857 --> 04:07:36.790
And as that threshold of consciousness begins to...

04:07:38.248 --> 04:07:41.464
fade into the realm of dream,

04:07:44.922 --> 04:07:46.396
Beau and Caleb.

04:07:46.397 --> 04:07:47.422
ASHLEY: Fucking--

04:07:47.423 --> 04:07:48.704
LAURA: Fuck, fuck!

04:07:48.705 --> 04:07:50.936
MARISHA: I was waiting for it.
LAURA: Fuck!

04:07:50.937 --> 04:07:52.087
TRAVIS: Saddle up.

04:07:52.982 --> 04:07:55.035
MATT: In the darkness, you just hear a voice.

04:08:01.102 --> 04:08:02.853
"Your friends are peeking."

04:08:05.654 --> 04:08:06.914
MARISHA: He knew.

04:08:06.915 --> 04:08:10.215
MATT: "You are wily bastards.

04:08:11.442 --> 04:08:14.718
"Continuing to stick my sides like a thorn in my drawers.

04:08:16.382 --> 04:08:21.300
"Clever, but, well, not enough I have to respect it.

04:08:24.465 --> 04:08:26.780
"I'm not here to kill you.

04:08:26.781 --> 04:08:28.222
"Yet. (laughs)

04:08:29.312 --> 04:08:34.312
"I'm here to open a door, to take my reign.

04:08:34.552 --> 04:08:36.135
"Long may it be.

04:08:37.793 --> 04:08:39.551
"You're welcome to watch.

04:08:40.512 --> 04:08:42.179
"If you can keep up.

04:08:44.932 --> 04:08:46.815
"There's so much beyond this door.

04:08:49.022 --> 04:08:50.146
"So much."

04:08:50.147 --> 04:08:54.713
(harsh echoing whispers) "So much, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so much.

04:08:54.714 --> 04:08:57.905
"Aah," the screams begin to fill

04:08:59.997 --> 04:09:01.987
the space of your dream

04:09:01.988 --> 04:09:06.205
until it is just the sound of incessant static.

04:09:07.385 --> 04:09:11.352
(loud static noise)

04:09:13.022 --> 04:09:14.260
And that's where we'll end tonight.

04:09:14.261 --> 04:09:16.541
LAURA: No!
TRAVIS: (snaps fingers)

04:09:16.542 --> 04:09:17.375
TALIESIN: Cool.

04:09:17.376 --> 04:09:21.090
TRAVIS: ♪ (Addams Family theme music) ♪

04:09:21.091 --> 04:09:22.886
(laughter)

04:09:22.887 --> 04:09:25.021
ASHLEY: Oh god-- wait, you guys have two or three?

04:09:25.022 --> 04:09:26.151
MARISHA: Currently, we have two.

04:09:26.152 --> 04:09:27.476
ASHLEY: Currently, you have two.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

04:09:27.477 --> 04:09:28.310
TRAVIS: Currently.
TALIESIN: See what happens

04:09:28.311 --> 04:09:29.883
in the morning.
MARISHA: Question.

04:09:29.884 --> 04:09:30.941
MATT: Mm-hmm?

04:09:30.942 --> 04:09:34.211
MARISHA: Those wisdom saves from our Heroes' Feast.

04:09:34.212 --> 04:09:36.527
Are we still wise when we sleep?

04:09:38.852 --> 04:09:39.685
MATT: Sure.

04:09:40.772 --> 04:09:43.131
TRAVIS: (laughs) We'll find out.

04:09:43.132 --> 04:09:45.481
MARISHA: We'll find out, yeah.
MATT: Mm-hm.

04:09:45.482 --> 04:09:48.006
TRAVIS: Oh man.

04:09:48.007 --> 04:09:49.470
MATT: All righty.
SAM: Wowzers.

04:09:51.552 --> 04:09:53.575
MARISHA: I wonder if they had to go underwater.

04:09:55.132 --> 04:09:56.102
ASHLEY: You wonder if what?

04:09:56.103 --> 04:09:57.231
TRAVIS: Had to go underwater.

04:09:57.232 --> 04:09:59.531
MARISHA: If they had to go underwater.

04:09:59.532 --> 04:10:00.452
LAURA: Maybe.
TRAVIS: We can do that.

04:10:00.452 --> 04:10:01.385
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I was about to say,

04:10:01.386 --> 04:10:02.578
we're well built for that.

04:10:02.579 --> 04:10:03.412
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:10:05.612 --> 04:10:07.091
SAM: Wow.
MARISHA: God.

04:10:07.092 --> 04:10:09.540
TRAVIS: I'm particularly drag-free now.

04:10:09.541 --> 04:10:11.531
MATT: (laughs) That's true!

04:10:11.532 --> 04:10:12.365
(laughter)

04:10:12.366 --> 04:10:13.451
You are swimmer ready.

04:10:13.452 --> 04:10:14.285
TALIESIN: An extra five feet of movement.

04:10:14.285 --> 04:10:15.282
TRAVIS: I had a friend with alopecia.

04:10:15.283 --> 04:10:16.661
He was a bad looking dude, man.

04:10:16.662 --> 04:10:17.549
MATT: Yeah, dude.

04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:18.870
TALIESIN: I know a couple.
LIAM: Like a dolphin.

04:10:18.871 --> 04:10:20.542
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: (chatters)

04:10:22.042 --> 04:10:25.701
MATT: Oh, why can't I remember his name?
That amazing stunt actor.

04:10:25.702 --> 04:10:27.056
TALIESIN: Yep.
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah.

04:10:27.057 --> 04:10:27.948
MATT: He was in Game of Thrones for a bit,

04:10:27.949 --> 04:10:29.571
worked on a few mocap projects.

04:10:29.572 --> 04:10:31.311
He's such a badass.

04:10:31.312 --> 04:10:35.078
Joe-- oh, I can't remember his name, anyway.

04:10:35.079 --> 04:10:38.536
It's been many years like nine,
eight years, since I saw him last.

04:10:38.537 --> 04:10:40.161
Anyway, he's amazing.

We're still on the air.

04:10:40.996 --> 04:10:42.050
Hi, everybody.

04:10:42.051 --> 04:10:43.901
(laughter)

04:10:43.902 --> 04:10:46.601
Thank you so much for joining us.

04:10:46.602 --> 04:10:47.435
We'll pick it up next week,

04:10:47.436 --> 04:10:49.211
but until then we love you very much.

04:10:49.212 --> 04:10:50.911
And, is it Thursday yet?

00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:00.922
MATT: Hello, everyone!

2
00:00:00.922 --> 00:00:02.389
And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:03.688
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:05.298
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:08.068
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:08.068 --> 00:00:09.431
LAURA: This gets worse and worse.

7
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:14.431
MATT: It's a slow descent into complete and utter madness.

8
00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:16.860
Before we jump into tonight's game,

9
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.591
we have some quick announcements to get through.

10
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:20.849
First and foremost, our returning sponsor

11
00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.111
of campaign two: our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam.

12
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:25.944
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond.

13
00:00:25.944 --> 00:00:27.690
You know what's great about D&amp;D Beyond, guys?

14
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.106
TRAVIS: Tell us, Sam.
LIAM: Everything.

15
00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:31.488
SAM: Everything, but also they don't know

16
00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:33.857
what they're sponsoring every week.

17
00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:36.799
They know generally that the show, or the show that we do,

18
00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:39.467
we play the D&amp;Ds and stuff, they get that.

19
00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:41.959
But they don't know this segment what they're going to get.

20
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:44.078
Sometimes they get an award-winning

21
00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:46.257
song parody from yours truly.

22
00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:48.849
Other times they get a glimpse into history,

23
00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.369
and that's what we're going to do today.

24
00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:51.337
MATT: Sometimes they get a shark costume.

25
00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:52.924
SAM: Sometimes they get a shark costume.

26
00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:55.647
You guys know that I was a huge fan

27
00:00:55.647 --> 00:00:57.871
of the sitcom You've Got Gale growing up.

28
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.321
It only ran one episode,

29
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.471
but it was massively influential to me.

30
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:05.751
I've brought script pages

31
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.001
from the episodes, lost episodes.

32
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.492
In the past, I've presented things that I've found

33
00:01:11.492 --> 00:01:13.831
about You've Got Gale,

34
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:15.761
starring our own Ashley Johnson, but--

35
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:16.594
LAURA: You were so good at it.

36
00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:18.097
ASHLEY: Thank you so much.

37
00:01:18.097 --> 00:01:20.401
SAM: I was just at the, as you guys know,

38
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.391
every Wednesday I go to the Film and TV Archives

39
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:24.921
in Hollywood and I was there yesterday,

40
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:29.041
and I found something that I did not know existed.

41
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.631
CBS when they put out this program were so forward-thinking

42
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:35.561
that they already had a movie spin-off planned

43
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.389
for You've Got Gale, and they shot a trailer for it.

44
00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.351
Now the trailer has been lost to time.

45
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:42.740
They only saved it on Betamax tape,

46
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.892
but the transcript of the trailer exists.

47
00:01:45.892 --> 00:01:49.189
So tonight with D&amp;D Beyond's support,

48
00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.631
we will present a radio play of sorts of the trailer

49
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.780
for the spin-off movie for the show You've Got Gale,

50
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.971
that had definitely existed in the 80s.

51
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.804
TRAVIS: Oh, that's what this is.

52
00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:02.009
ASHLEY: How did you find this?

53
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889
I just, it's amazing.
SAM: It was deep

54
00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.658
in the back of the library.

55
00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.196
Anyway, Matt will be narrating,

56
00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:10.887
Marisha's going to be doing sound effects for us.

57
00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:13.026
Everyone's playing a little role.

58
00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:15.066
Maybe some music, Matt, if you don't mind.

59
00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:15.899
MATT: Yeah, we can do that.

60
00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.065
SAM: Just a little action.

61
00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.346
(laughter)

62
00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.818
This is a trailer that you would've seen

63
00:02:19.818 --> 00:02:23.797
in a movie theater in like, 1985.

64
00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:25.917
Take it away.

65
00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.492
MATT: (movie trailer VO voice) This summer,

66
00:02:27.492 --> 00:02:30.287
a new hero will rise.

67
00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:31.989
ASHLEY: Save the orphans!

68
00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.909
I'm going to take out their headquarters!

69
00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:34.807
LIAM: (gruff voice) No!

70
00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:36.658
It's a suicide mission!

71
00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:38.348
They have missile launchers!

72
00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:40.218
ASHLEY: Missile launchers?

73
00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:41.509
MARISHA: (gun cocking)

74
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.917
ASHLEY: I eat missile launchers for brunch.

75
00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:45.938
MARISHA: Dun-dum!

76
00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:48.197
MATT: A hero without a past.

77
00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:50.397
TRAVIS: (Russian accent) You shot all of my men!

78
00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:51.687
How did you find me?!

79
00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.286
Who are you?

80
00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:54.527
ASHLEY: Folks call me--

81
00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:55.595
MARISHA: (gun cocking)

82
00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:57.277
ASHLEY: -- justice, bitch.

83
00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.527
(laughter)

84
00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:04.527
MATT: On the battlefield, she's an ice-cold killer.

85
00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:08.018
But in the bedroom, a red hot lover.

86
00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:09.018
(phone ringing)

87
00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:12.469
LAURA: My god, what did you do to me last night?

88
00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.969
ASHLEY: Everything your body wanted.

89
00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.774
LAURA: Cigarette?

90
00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:22.672
ASHLEY: Thanks, but I don't think that cigarette--

91
00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:23.705
MARISHA: (gun cocking)

92
00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:24.985
ASHLEY: --could handle me.

93
00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:26.834
(laughter)

94
00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.196
LAURA: Oh!

95
00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:30.745
MATT: A hero with one name.

96
00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:32.202
TALIESIN: Damn it!

97
00:03:32.202 --> 00:03:34.735
I'm the President of the United States of America,

98
00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.823
and I'm ordering you to stand down!

99
00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:39.335
ASHLEY: Excuse me, Mr. President.

100
00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:40.215
MARISHA: (gun cocking)

101
00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:42.604
ASHLEY: Why don't you gag me with a spoon?

102
00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:44.193
MARISHA: Dun-dum!

103
00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:48.473
MATT: Ashley Johnson is Gale, in Gale Force Five,

104
00:03:48.473 --> 00:03:52.844
a Gale in Your Coffin, gagging spoons in theaters everywhere

105
00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:54.344
this Memorial Day.

106
00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:56.775
SAM: That was brilliant!

107
00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:58.913
TRAVIS: Oh man, just like when you were younger!

108
00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:02.600
ASHLEY: Yeah, it took a while to get back into it.

109
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.235
MATT: It's a shame that never made it--

110
00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:08.189
ASHLEY: It's a shame, it was going to be really special.

111
00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.022
When did we shoot it?

112
00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:10.003
MATT: How much did you shoot?

113
00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:11.919
ASHLEY: How much did we? We shot a whole film.

114
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.250
It was five hours, but.

115
00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.261
It just was too long.

116
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.861
SAM: It was completely shot on Betamaxes.

117
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:19.694
ASHLEY: It was.

118
00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:22.130
LIAM: When I was a kid in the 80's,

119
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.930
Terminator 2 and Gale Force Five

120
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.718
informed my whole childhood.

121
00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:26.841
TRAVIS: That's true.

122
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:28.671
ASHLEY: Absolutely.

123
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:30.338
TALIESIN: Both good uses of the LA river, too.

124
00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:33.213
(laughter)

125
00:04:33.213 --> 00:04:35.471
SAM: Anyway, thank you D&amp;D Beyond,

126
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:39.101
for bringing wonderful art like this back into our lives.

127
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.642
We appreciate you, please subscribe, if you haven't already.

128
00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:44.711
MATT: Thank you, Sam, thank you D&amp;D Beyond.

129
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:46.053
Just to remind you,

130
00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:47.271
because I don't think it came up in that entire spot,

131
00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:51.071
D&amp;D Beyond is a service where you can create D&amp;D characters.

132
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.351
Digitally.

133
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.721
And keep all your character information online.

134
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:58.162
It's very useful, we use it too,

135
00:04:58.162 --> 00:04:59.333
thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

136
00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.583
(laughter)

137
00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:03.791
Okay.

138
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:06.041
(laughter)

139
00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:08.162
Letting you guys know,

140
00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:10.721
we are heading to Denver Pop Culture Con,

141
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:12.522
the first weekend of June, coming up a lot faster

142
00:05:12.522 --> 00:05:14.570
than I think any of us were prepared for.

143
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.562
We have a limited number of autograph

144
00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:19.853
and photo ops available at denverpopculturecon.com,

145
00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.771
so make sure you check it out.

146
00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.419
Goes without saying, but I'm going to say it,

147
00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.077
because we're going to keep saying this,

148
00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:28.148
because we're filled with so much gratefulness,

149
00:05:28.148 --> 00:05:30.278
thank you everybody who helped make this Kickstarter

150
00:05:30.278 --> 00:05:32.699
as insane as it's been.

151
00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.040
We closed out midnight of last week

152
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.469
with our friend, Joel Hodgson, present.

153
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.499
We had a little half an hour closing party,

154
00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:40.859
you can see on our YouTube channel,

155
00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:42.029
where we all got super emotional

156
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.962
and proceeded to down shot after shot of "totally alcohol,"

157
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.713
but yeah--

158
00:05:50.713 --> 00:05:52.893
LAURA: We sold it well, though.

159
00:05:52.893 --> 00:05:53.952
TRAVIS: It had a good sting.

160
00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:56.213
TALIESIN: That was definitely not caffeinated,

161
00:05:56.213 --> 00:05:58.653
and definitely didn't keep me up for five hours after.

162
00:05:58.653 --> 00:06:00.001
That was not a problem.

163
00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:03.281
MARISHA: Got no emails from our Twitch rep, so (click).

164
00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:06.373
I think the statute of limitations has passed.

165
00:06:06.373 --> 00:06:07.601
MATT: No seriously, thank you guys so much

166
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:08.613
for all your support.

167
00:06:08.613 --> 00:06:10.332
We're now knee-deep in the pre-production

168
00:06:10.332 --> 00:06:12.554
and getting everything going.

169
00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:15.293
We're super excited and it's been fun

170
00:06:15.293 --> 00:06:16.973
for a lot of us to go back and start listening

171
00:06:16.973 --> 00:06:20.096
and rewatching the old campaign episodes

172
00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:21.634
and reliving those moments.

173
00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:22.853
LIAM: We're going to make a cartoon!

174
00:06:22.853 --> 00:06:26.213
TRAVIS: We were so good at D&amp;D back then.

175
00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:27.413
What's advantage?

176
00:06:27.413 --> 00:06:29.473
LAURA: Oh, gosh.

177
00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:30.713
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm not ready.

178
00:06:30.713 --> 00:06:33.799
MATT: You are remotely better now, it's good.

179
00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:34.875
Thank you guys, again.

180
00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.425
Laura, do you have a merch update?

181
00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:37.425
LAURA: Oh, I do.

182
00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:39.513
You might have noticed on Twitter today

183
00:06:39.513 --> 00:06:42.145
that we announced our

184
00:06:42.145 --> 00:06:45.435
Grog Strongjaw mugs.

185
00:06:45.435 --> 00:06:47.475
TRAVIS: (as Grog) (excited noises)

186
00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:48.763
LAURA: Ale tankards.

187
00:06:48.763 --> 00:06:50.465
Wait, and this is the box it comes in.

188
00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:51.875
SAM: The box is fucking lit.

189
00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:52.995
LAURA: We haven't shown this off yet,

190
00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:54.145
and we're really excited about the box,

191
00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:55.865
so I'm going to, hold on, hold on.

192
00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:56.698
SAM: It's an unboxing.

193
00:06:56.698 --> 00:06:58.515
LAURA: Oh my god, it's an unboxing.

194
00:06:58.515 --> 00:07:02.003
This is the mug, hold on, hold on, hold on.

195
00:07:02.003 --> 00:07:03.865
It's got, "How Do You Want to Do This?"

196
00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:06.545
If you drink, it's got Critical Role

197
00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:08.275
written on the bottom so everyone sees it.

198
00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:09.108
SAM: Oh nice.

199
00:07:09.108 --> 00:07:12.158
LAURA: Then, another thing you can buy is this!

200
00:07:12.158 --> 00:07:14.747
That you could add to it, if you want to be Grog-y about it,

201
00:07:14.747 --> 00:07:16.096
or Yasha-y about it.

202
00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:19.537
ASHLEY: Yeah! I would like to rage!

203
00:07:19.537 --> 00:07:22.606
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (rage yelling)

204
00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:24.121
LAURA: It's pretty fucking cool.

205
00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:25.445
SAM: That is.

206
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.275
LAURA: We're really excited about it.

207
00:07:27.275 --> 00:07:29.071
SAM: I want eight of them for my dining room table.

208
00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:30.778
LAURA: Oh, shit!

209
00:07:30.778 --> 00:07:32.111
Then can I say one other thing

210
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:33.780
that's not on the announcement list?

211
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.133
Because this just came in today.

212
00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:37.612
(excited breathing)

213
00:07:37.612 --> 00:07:40.411
This is my new dice bag!

214
00:07:40.411 --> 00:07:42.031
Look at it, wait, look at, look!

215
00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:44.640
This is by Christina. She's amazing.

216
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.292
I'll put a link to her Etsy page because she's phenomenal.

217
00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:49.620
She does custom bags and so she did my Vex one,

218
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.962
which is really full,

219
00:07:50.962 --> 00:07:53.391
and now I can fill up a second Jester one,

220
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.740
and on the inside, she did like,

221
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.100
a thing where it's got Jester doodles

222
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.762
on the inside of the bag, like there's Tusktooth!

223
00:08:01.762 --> 00:08:03.781
It's just amazing,

224
00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:05.341
and I haven't had a chance to put dice in it yet,

225
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:06.573
because it just came in, but.

226
00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:07.592
LIAM: You're going to wipe the slate clean

227
00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:09.381
and start all over with new dice.

228
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:12.048
LAURA: Shut up, shut up, shut up, no!

229
00:08:13.317 --> 00:08:15.850
Thank you, Christina, I really appreciate that.

230
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.799
ASHLEY: I'm going to commission one.

231
00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:18.632
LAURA: Yeah.

232
00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:19.673
ASHLEY: I want one.

233
00:08:19.673 --> 00:08:21.658
LAURA: They're pretty amazing.

234
00:08:21.658 --> 00:08:22.491
TALIESIN: I feel like that's admitting I have a habit,

235
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:23.480
I'm not ready for that.

236
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.920
(laughter)

237
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.880
MATT: I believe that ends our announcements

238
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.479
and as such, let's bring us in

239
00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:34.840
for tonight's episode of Critical Role.

240
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.010

LIAM: --daddy.

273
00:10:14.764 --> 00:10:18.134
MATT: And welcome back.

274
00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:22.923
Last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

275
00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:26.091
after allying themselves for the time being

276
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:28.552
with The Bright Queen, of the Kryn Dynasty,

277
00:10:28.552 --> 00:10:30.691
over in Rosohna, previously known,

278
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:33.470
historically as Ghor Dranas.

279
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.881
Once the center of the Betrayer Gods,

280
00:10:36.881 --> 00:10:39.800
machinations in the Calamity,

281
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.683
you begin to inquire as to means to further deepen

282
00:10:43.683 --> 00:10:48.473
this alliance and gain some more funds to continue

283
00:10:48.473 --> 00:10:50.782
your own respective interests.

284
00:10:50.782 --> 00:10:52.604
Upon speaking with Professor Waccoh,

285
00:10:52.604 --> 00:10:57.604
you were sent to the nearby mines in the Vermaloc Forest,

286
00:10:57.685 --> 00:11:01.584
where it seems a bastion of stone giants

287
00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:03.965
has taken over and sent most of the miners

288
00:11:03.965 --> 00:11:06.856
and steel workers running.

289
00:11:06.856 --> 00:11:09.485
Upon going there you briefly tussled with the giants

290
00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:12.323
before, instead, coming to a conversation

291
00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:14.725
and thinking maybe there's something beyond

292
00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:17.659
just this conflict.

293
00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:20.411
Finding that the giants had been

294
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:22.341
essentially scared out of their home

295
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:24.981
and they came here as means of defending themselves,

296
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:26.571
you have made an agreement

297
00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:31.078
to help them in clearing out their home

298
00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:33.200
and whatever else seems to have pushed them out of it

299
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.109
and in return, they would return.

300
00:11:36.109 --> 00:11:38.619
You managed to have one of them come along with you.

301
00:11:38.619 --> 00:11:41.747
The Landspeaker Soorna agreed to join you

302
00:11:41.747 --> 00:11:45.176
as you went to where they once lived in the Braan,

303
00:11:45.176 --> 00:11:47.399
which is Giant for belly.

304
00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:49.579
Upon arriving and slowly making your way

305
00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:52.297
through the wide stone giant tunnels,

306
00:11:52.297 --> 00:11:56.560
you were immediately beset with small demonic creatures.

307
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.309
One of which, this sickly bulbous flea-like entity,

308
00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:04.257
or the fly-like entity, its a droning sound,

309
00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:07.899
the buzzing of its wings, causing a number of you

310
00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:11.669
to fall unconscious and nearly snuffing the life from Fjord,

311
00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:14.120
you managed to best them in battle.

312
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:19.120
In the quiet moments, take a few minutes to breathe,

313
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.363
heal up, and in Nott's instance,

314
00:12:22.363 --> 00:12:25.643
inspect the corpse of one of the fallen giants

315
00:12:25.643 --> 00:12:28.032
near the Bone Pit, this large open pit,

316
00:12:28.032 --> 00:12:29.231
that is filled with bones

317
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:31.291
about ten feet down and below.

318
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:34.251
Upon inspecting the body, you watch this strange glowing,

319
00:12:34.251 --> 00:12:36.992
jellyfish-like entity, just drift

320
00:12:36.992 --> 00:12:40.163
ethereally out of the wall and then lower itself

321
00:12:40.163 --> 00:12:41.763
into the body of the dead giant,

322
00:12:41.763 --> 00:12:44.581
in which the dead giant began to reanimate,

323
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:47.083
its jaw tearing open into a terrible grin,

324
00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:48.723
the flesh on the sides of its face,

325
00:12:48.723 --> 00:12:51.720
tearing up to where near its ears are

326
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.970
before it begins to rouse and that's where we left off.

327
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.036
TRAVIS: I think you're misremembering.

328
00:12:56.036 --> 00:12:58.971
TALIESIN: Did I recognize the jellyfish entity,

329
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:00.432
does it seem like something I would know?

330
00:13:00.432 --> 00:13:01.265
MATT: Make a religion check.

331
00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:02.929
TALIESIN: I will make a religion check.

332
00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:05.196
Same as it ever was.

333
00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:07.668
12.

334
00:13:07.668 --> 00:13:09.659
MATT: You have no idea what this is.

335
00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:13.918
You're not sure of the essence or nature of it,

336
00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:17.098
but you're watching a dead body now come to animate itself

337
00:13:17.098 --> 00:13:19.428
after coming into contact and absorbing this entity.

338
00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:20.558
TRAVIS: The one behind the pit, right?

339
00:13:20.558 --> 00:13:21.778
The one in the room we're in?

340
00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:26.258
MATT: Correct. You do still have one spell that is active.

341
00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:29.238
You still have your Holy Weapon active.

342
00:13:29.238 --> 00:13:30.849
I would like you all to roll initiative.

343
00:13:30.849 --> 00:13:33.771
(groaning)

344
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.566
TRAVIS: Going back to the Grog die.

345
00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:36.913
LIAM: Colville die.

346
00:13:36.913 --> 00:13:40.238
SAM: We are starting off with combat that is powered by

347
00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:42.667
Dwarven Forge. They currently have a free

348
00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:46.268
406 page PDF module tied to their Dungeons of Doom products,

349
00:13:46.268 --> 00:13:48.838
available now on their website, Dwarven Forge.

350
00:13:48.838 --> 00:13:49.878
LAURA: Whoosh!

351
00:13:49.878 --> 00:13:52.756
MATT: Nice. 25 to 20?

352
00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:54.673
TALIESIN: 16, oh, yeah.

353
00:13:55.658 --> 00:13:57.608
We're going to do great! I'm fine!

354
00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:58.642
SAM: What did you just say?

355
00:13:58.642 --> 00:14:00.170
TALIESIN: Never mind.

356
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.337
TRAVIS: Don't panic!

357
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:05.631
MATT: 25 to 20?

358
00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:07.271
TRAVIS: Nobody.

359
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:08.271
MATT: 20 to 15?

360
00:14:08.271 --> 00:14:09.879
TALIESIN: 16.
LAURA: 17.

361
00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:11.603
LIAM: 15.

362
00:14:11.603 --> 00:14:12.639
TRAVIS: Jester, Caleb--

363
00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:13.930
MATT: Caduceus then Caleb.

364
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.596
TRAVIS: Yes.

365
00:14:15.596 --> 00:14:16.836
LIAM: Are you Swedish?

366
00:14:16.836 --> 00:14:17.669
MATT: 15 to 10?

367
00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:19.335
MARISHA: 14.
ASHLEY: 14!

368
00:14:19.335 --> 00:14:20.168
TRAVIS: 12.

369
00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:22.239
LIAM: Man, don't even recognize you anymore.

370
00:14:22.239 --> 00:14:24.858
LAURA and ASHLEY: 14!

371
00:14:24.858 --> 00:14:27.525
MATT: And then Fjord under that.

372
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.466
Ten to five?

373
00:14:30.466 --> 00:14:33.883
SAM: That would be seven for me, Matthew.

374
00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:41.164
MATT: First up, as this giant, its head

375
00:14:41.164 --> 00:14:43.444
sickeningly snapping its neck,

376
00:14:43.444 --> 00:14:46.415
you hear the bones cracking as it adjusts itself,

377
00:14:46.415 --> 00:14:49.363
right up to face the rest of you, while its body is still

378
00:14:49.363 --> 00:14:51.756
laying entirely in a horizontal space.

379
00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:56.116
It's arms, (cracking), and it begins to shudder

380
00:14:56.116 --> 00:14:58.895
and stand with this horrible series of sounds

381
00:14:58.895 --> 00:15:01.665
as its body seems to be folding and breaking its way,

382
00:15:01.665 --> 00:15:03.916
back to its position, but it's your turn,

383
00:15:03.916 --> 00:15:05.964
what are you doing?

384
00:15:05.964 --> 00:15:06.863
LAURA: Oh, god.

385
00:15:06.863 --> 00:15:09.226
I'm going to grab my symbol of the Traveler,

386
00:15:09.226 --> 00:15:10.375
and I'm going to say:

387
00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:11.956
I hope you're down here with us right now,

388
00:15:11.956 --> 00:15:13.573
because I could really use your help!

389
00:15:13.573 --> 00:15:15.522
I'm going to try to Turn Undead.

390
00:15:15.522 --> 00:15:16.863
MATT: Okay.

391
00:15:16.863 --> 00:15:17.964
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Ooh!

392
00:15:17.964 --> 00:15:18.933
SAM: To a giant?

393
00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:20.566
LAURA: I can do it to an undead.

394
00:15:20.566 --> 00:15:21.908
TALIESIN: If it's undead.

395
00:15:21.908 --> 00:15:23.463
MATT: That is a 15, what's the DC?

396
00:15:23.463 --> 00:15:24.394
LAURA: 17!

397
00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:25.935
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yeah!

398
00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:27.018
MARISHA: Out of the gate.

399
00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:29.234
SAM: Short fight. Right?

400
00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:31.794
TRAVIS: No. Look at all that covered shit.

401
00:15:31.794 --> 00:15:32.983
LAURA: (reading) "It will spend its turn trying to move

402
00:15:32.983 --> 00:15:34.423
"as far away from you as it can,

403
00:15:34.423 --> 00:15:36.724
"it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you,

404
00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:39.141
"it also can't take reactions.

405
00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:41.863
"For its action, it can only use the dash action,

406
00:15:41.863 --> 00:15:43.524
"or try to escape from an effect

407
00:15:43.524 --> 00:15:46.448
"that prevents it from moving."

408
00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:48.556
SAM: Oh, wait, so it can't even attack anybody else?

409
00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:51.904
LAURA: It can't come within 30 feet of me.

410
00:15:51.904 --> 00:15:54.306
MATT: Are you going to move, or are you going to stay put?

411
00:15:54.306 --> 00:15:56.537
LAURA: I'm going to...

412
00:15:56.537 --> 00:15:57.866
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

413
00:15:57.866 --> 00:15:59.562
TRAVIS: (pigeon cooing) Come over here!

414
00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:01.853
MATT: No pigeon.

415
00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:04.447
LAURA: I'm going to move, is that other creature still here?

416
00:16:04.447 --> 00:16:06.706
That other thing isn't still here?

417
00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:07.805
MATT: Currently, the only thing that you know

418
00:16:07.805 --> 00:16:11.175
that's moving in the vicinity is the giant.

419
00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:12.607
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to move over

420
00:16:12.607 --> 00:16:16.053
and try to hide a little bit behind, yeah, right there.

421
00:16:16.053 --> 00:16:16.886
MATT: All right.

422
00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:20.553
LAURA: Not--I'm going to stand next to it, yeah.

423
00:16:20.553 --> 00:16:23.215
TALIESIN: I also, oh god, it's Turn Undead,

424
00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:25.634
so if we hit the giant, then the Turn Undead ends, right?

425
00:16:25.634 --> 00:16:26.982
Yeah, okay, so.

426
00:16:26.982 --> 00:16:29.783
LAURA: Does it? It doesn't say that.

427
00:16:29.783 --> 00:16:31.183
(reading) "If the creature fails its saving throw,

428
00:16:31.183 --> 00:16:33.815
"it is turned for one minute or until it takes any damage,"

429
00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:35.324
so don't hit it.

430
00:16:35.324 --> 00:16:37.998
MATT: That finishes your turn, Jester. Caduceus.

431
00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:41.871
TALIESIN: I was trying to remember my fucking rules,

432
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:43.366
my brain's made of swiss cheese.

433
00:16:43.366 --> 00:16:46.254
I'm going to, this is looking weird,

434
00:16:46.254 --> 00:16:47.754
so I'm going to...

435
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.700
get a little bit of distance,

436
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.238
I'm going to head towards our giant,

437
00:16:54.238 --> 00:16:57.415
our non-undead giant friend over here

438
00:16:57.415 --> 00:16:58.578
and while I pass Fjord,

439
00:16:58.578 --> 00:17:01.545
I'm going to tap him and cast Death Ward.

440
00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:02.670
MATT: On the giant?

441
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.503
TALIESIN: No, on Fjord.

442
00:17:03.503 --> 00:17:05.601
MATT: Oh, Fjord. You have Death Ward on you.

443
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:07.310
TALIESIN: Which means that when you drop to zero hit points,

444
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.052
you immediately pop back up to one.

445
00:17:09.052 --> 00:17:09.900
TRAVIS: Great.

446
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.070
MATT: Are you going full movement, or are you staying there?

447
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.172
You have ten more movement.

448
00:17:14.172 --> 00:17:16.561
TALIESIN: I want to hide in that corner if possible,

449
00:17:16.561 --> 00:17:19.923
yeah, get a little behind.

450
00:17:19.923 --> 00:17:21.454
MATT: That's as close as you can get right there.

451
00:17:21.454 --> 00:17:22.324
That finishes your go.

452
00:17:22.324 --> 00:17:23.921
TALIESIN: That finishes my go.

453
00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:24.853
MATT: Caleb.

454
00:17:24.853 --> 00:17:27.422
LIAM: I don't think that Caleb knows what's going on,

455
00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.553
because he's over here, looking out,

456
00:17:29.553 --> 00:17:32.288
so I'm just going to ready a Fire Bolt

457
00:17:32.288 --> 00:17:33.542
for anything that appears,

458
00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:34.913
and if something appears that looks dangerous,

459
00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:35.746
I'm going to blast it.

460
00:17:35.746 --> 00:17:37.052
MATT: That's true, you would not have actually seen

461
00:17:37.052 --> 00:17:40.174
any visual trigger for the Turn Undead.

462
00:17:40.174 --> 00:17:41.252
You're preparing a Fire Bolt--

463
00:17:41.252 --> 00:17:43.113
LIAM: Fire Bolt for anything dangerous coming.

464
00:17:43.113 --> 00:17:44.779
MATT: You got it. All righty.

465
00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:47.985
Finishing your turn then Caleb, so Beau and Yasha.

466
00:17:47.985 --> 00:17:49.151
What are you doing?

467
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:52.703
ASHLEY: You can go. I don't know where I am.

468
00:17:52.703 --> 00:17:56.374
MARISHA: Oh, I saw Jester do her cool thing,

469
00:17:56.374 --> 00:18:00.950
so I'm going to bolt ahead towards the direction of Caleb.

470
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:01.801
MATT: Go for it.

471
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:04.801
MARISHA: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.

472
00:18:06.649 --> 00:18:08.329
TALIESIN: Actually, where is Yasha?

473
00:18:08.329 --> 00:18:09.809
MATT: You going to hold your action, or?

474
00:18:09.809 --> 00:18:12.567
LIAM: Yasha's here, right by Marisha's board.

475
00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:13.449
TALIESIN: Oh, that would explain why.

476
00:18:13.449 --> 00:18:14.774
MATT: Yeah, she should be up here with the rest of you.

477
00:18:14.774 --> 00:18:16.674
I don't know why she got put over there.

478
00:18:16.674 --> 00:18:19.139
ASHLEY: I feel like I closed the rift thingy-mabobber.

479
00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:21.373
I think I'm in the hallway.

480
00:18:21.373 --> 00:18:24.705
I was over there. Oh, because it happened right there.

481
00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:26.260
MATT: We'll put you in that space and time.

482
00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.236
You're in that general vicinity.

483
00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:29.188
ASHLEY: I'm in the general vicinity, okay.

484
00:18:29.188 --> 00:18:31.900
MARISHA: I'm going to bonus action dash.

485
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.449
MATT: Okay.

486
00:18:33.449 --> 00:18:37.148
MARISHA: Move behind the stalactite

487
00:18:37.148 --> 00:18:40.998
and try and peek and then can I--

488
00:18:40.998 --> 00:18:43.111
MATT: Okay.

489
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:44.545
MARISHA: Use my...

490
00:18:45.689 --> 00:18:47.420
wait, run.

491
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.299
ALL: Wait. Wait.

492
00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:53.500
MARISHA: I want to Patient Defense, can I do that, no?

493
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.740
MATT: Your action is dash?

494
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.740
MARISHA: Then my move, bonus action, sorry, Patient Defense.

495
00:18:59.878 --> 00:19:01.032
MATT: Then ki point to Patient Defense?

496
00:19:01.032 --> 00:19:01.865
MARISHA: Yes.

497
00:19:01.865 --> 00:19:03.460
MATT: You got it. So you go into defensive state.

498
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.289
MARISHA: Then can I see anything in the dark?

499
00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:09.065
MATT: You used your action and other things, so you're not--

500
00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.910
make a general perception check,

501
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:11.990
I'll say with disadvantage,

502
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.380
because you didn't take an action to try

503
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.860
and see specifically the vicinity around you in the dark.

504
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.780
MARISHA: Eight.

505
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.649
MATT: Eight?

506
00:19:18.649 --> 00:19:21.430
In the essence of running over there, getting behind it,

507
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.680
and preparing yourself to defend,

508
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.460
you've only just started glancing over there

509
00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.830
so you can't make out too much detail,

510
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.361
so the next round more of it will become available to you,

511
00:19:28.361 --> 00:19:29.698
but this round,

512
00:19:29.698 --> 00:19:31.769
your eyes are still focusing from the transition.

513
00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:32.689
MARISHA: Copy.

514
00:19:32.689 --> 00:19:34.481
MATT: That finishes your turn. Yasha, what you got?

515
00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:35.398
ASHLEY: Okay.

516
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.560
I want to start making my way towards the hall,

517
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.393
but on the move, I would like to...

518
00:19:44.445 --> 00:19:48.001
Place a hand on Fjord before I leave.

519
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:52.201
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Healing Hands,

520
00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:54.750
which restores you for nine hit points,

521
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.612
but I don't know if you--

522
00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:58.836
TRAVIS: I'll take it! Yeah! That's great.

523
00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:00.853
ASHLEY: It's something. So I'll do that.

524
00:20:00.853 --> 00:20:01.972
MATT: You put your hand out.

525
00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:06.268
ASHLEY: As I'm walking by and then I will finish my move

526
00:20:06.268 --> 00:20:07.990
to go out into the hallway.

527
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.573
MATT: You got it.

528
00:20:09.573 --> 00:20:10.669
TRAVIS: Thank you.

529
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:11.980
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

530
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.575
MATT: 35, 40 is your movement?

531
00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:15.408
ASHLEY: Yep.

532
00:20:15.408 --> 00:20:18.649
MATT: You got it. You touch Fjord. You feel light

533
00:20:18.649 --> 00:20:22.119
coming out of your aasimar angelic essence.

534
00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:23.658
It surges through him and helps

535
00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:25.439
mend him of his wounds. You rush past,

536
00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:27.748
turn the corner, pass your giant friend, Soorna,

537
00:20:27.748 --> 00:20:29.639
and turn around to see both Caleb and Beau

538
00:20:29.639 --> 00:20:31.057
preparing for whatever is beyond

539
00:20:31.057 --> 00:20:31.938
that hallway in the darkness.

540
00:20:31.938 --> 00:20:32.771
ASHLEY: Okay, and I'm preparing.

541
00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:36.010
MATT: That finishes your go. Fjord, you're up.

542
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.957
TRAVIS: I feel real fucking bad.

543
00:20:38.957 --> 00:20:41.348
Can I use my 30 feet of movement

544
00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:43.498
to head towards the hallway as well?

545
00:20:43.498 --> 00:20:44.498
MATT: Certainly.

546
00:20:46.588 --> 00:20:47.730
TRAVIS: Great.

547
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:52.639
Thanks, Yasha, and I will cast Armor of Agathys on myself,

548
00:20:52.639 --> 00:20:57.509
at 5th-level, which will give me 25 temporary hit points.

549
00:20:57.509 --> 00:20:59.786
MATT: Okay, there you go.

550
00:20:59.786 --> 00:21:00.747
Perfect.

551
00:21:00.747 --> 00:21:02.958
TRAVIS: (hissing)

552
00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:06.843
MATT: The moisture in this cavern area

553
00:21:06.843 --> 00:21:08.054
that is around you all of a sudden

554
00:21:08.054 --> 00:21:09.894
gets siphoned out of its spaces

555
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:13.273
and begins to droplet onto Fjord's armor. As it does,

556
00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.334
mist forms around the outside of the leather

557
00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:18.715
and all of it turns into layer after layer of shards of ice,

558
00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:22.305
pointing outward. That finishes your go.

559
00:21:22.305 --> 00:21:27.055
End of Fjord's turn, it is now the giant's turn.

560
00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:31.193
You've seen undead turned, you've seen them,

561
00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:32.166
the look of fear in their eyes.

562
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:33.817
LAURA: Oh no.

563
00:21:33.817 --> 00:21:36.084
MATT: This one, as its body is rising,

564
00:21:36.084 --> 00:21:38.235
it still maintains eye contact with you.

565
00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:41.097
(crunching)

566
00:21:41.097 --> 00:21:42.206
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh no.

567
00:21:42.206 --> 00:21:43.456
SAM: What does it?

568
00:21:44.875 --> 00:21:49.856
MATT: For whatever reason, it seems like it would be undead,

569
00:21:49.856 --> 00:21:51.494
but it's not turned.

570
00:21:51.494 --> 00:21:52.843
LAURA: Oh, all right.

571
00:21:52.843 --> 00:21:55.217
LIAM: It's a skeleton robit.

572
00:21:55.217 --> 00:21:56.883
TALIESIN: It's a robit?
LIAM: Robit.

573
00:21:56.883 --> 00:21:58.107
MATT: Half of its movement to stand up,

574
00:21:58.107 --> 00:21:59.657
it still has 20 more feet of movement.

575
00:21:59.657 --> 00:22:01.016
LIAM: Oh boy.

576
00:22:01.016 --> 00:22:02.932
It's going to --

577
00:22:02.932 --> 00:22:05.515
TRAVIS: Not see Nott.

578
00:22:05.515 --> 00:22:06.507
MATT: No, it sees you, Nott,

579
00:22:06.507 --> 00:22:07.715
it's going to take a swing at you.

580
00:22:07.715 --> 00:22:10.617
TRAVIS: Its vision's based on movement!

581
00:22:10.617 --> 00:22:13.580
MATT: Natural 20. No joke.

582
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.856
TALIESIN: Wait, let me see?

583
00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:18.257
Oh, I don't have line of sight, fuck.

584
00:22:19.827 --> 00:22:21.204
SAM: Uncanny dodge.

585
00:22:21.204 --> 00:22:23.195
MATT: It's a good call on that one,

586
00:22:23.195 --> 00:22:25.153
so you take half--

587
00:22:25.153 --> 00:22:26.395
LIAM: Straight roll.

588
00:22:26.395 --> 00:22:29.978
TALIESIN: Fuck, because I don't have fucking visual.

589
00:22:31.895 --> 00:22:33.437
MARISHA: Cool, cool, cool.

590
00:22:33.437 --> 00:22:34.566
TALIESIN: Got to keep everybody in my line of sight.

591
00:22:34.566 --> 00:22:35.707
ASHLEY: We should've threw him in the--

592
00:22:35.707 --> 00:22:36.615
LIAM: Is it 30 or 60--

593
00:22:36.615 --> 00:22:39.806
MATT: 34 points of bludgeoning damage, halved.

594
00:22:39.806 --> 00:22:41.187
LAURA: How many, how many, how many?

595
00:22:41.187 --> 00:22:43.057
SAM: Wait, okay, wait, really?

596
00:22:43.057 --> 00:22:45.125
MATT: Because you have uncanny dodge, the total is 34.

597
00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:46.273
SAM: Weren't you going to double that?

598
00:22:46.273 --> 00:22:48.031
MATT: No, that's with the doubled.

599
00:22:48.031 --> 00:22:50.107
SAM: Oh, that's not that bad.

600
00:22:50.107 --> 00:22:52.774
MATT: So reduce that to 17.

601
00:22:53.804 --> 00:22:54.915
TALIESIN: 30 feet.

602
00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:55.864
LIAM: That's about to here.

603
00:22:55.864 --> 00:23:00.642
MATT: Yeah, and it's going to leap across the bone pit.

604
00:23:00.642 --> 00:23:01.851
TRAVIS: Please fail your acrobatics check!

605
00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:03.417
SAM: I take a swipe at it!

606
00:23:03.417 --> 00:23:04.250
MATT: Huh?

607
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.566
SAM: Can I take a swipe at it?

608
00:23:05.566 --> 00:23:07.864
MATT: Yeah, you can. It does leave your--

609
00:23:07.864 --> 00:23:08.995
SAM: I guess with a shortsword?

610
00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:09.828
MATT: Yes.

611
00:23:09.828 --> 00:23:14.303
SAM: Okay, ten plus shortsword.

612
00:23:14.303 --> 00:23:15.635
19.

613
00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:16.468
MATT: That does hit!

614
00:23:16.468 --> 00:23:19.556
SAM: Hey! Look at that.

615
00:23:19.556 --> 00:23:23.357
That's nine points of damage! From a shortsword!

616
00:23:23.357 --> 00:23:24.517
MATT: (whooshing)

617
00:23:24.517 --> 00:23:27.925
This flash, slight shimmer of whatever light is

618
00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:30.085
coming through the cavern reflects off the blade

619
00:23:30.085 --> 00:23:31.725
as, for the first time in a while,

620
00:23:31.725 --> 00:23:33.506
you've seen Nott use a non-crossbow.

621
00:23:33.506 --> 00:23:34.685
SAM: Uh!

622
00:23:34.685 --> 00:23:38.322
MATT: Carves past the heel. The flesh off its heel

623
00:23:38.322 --> 00:23:40.313
is now flapping a bit

624
00:23:40.313 --> 00:23:41.262
with the bone exposed.

625
00:23:41.262 --> 00:23:42.392
It doesn't seem hindered by it.

626
00:23:42.392 --> 00:23:45.083
As it lands, (crunching) as part of its landing,

627
00:23:45.083 --> 00:23:47.302
it's arcing down with its giant club

628
00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:49.969
on towards you, Jester.

629
00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:53.663
That is going to be 26 to hit.

630
00:23:53.663 --> 00:23:54.546
TRAVIS: No!

631
00:23:54.546 --> 00:23:57.126
LAURA: Oh, yeah, I guess that hits me.

632
00:23:57.126 --> 00:23:57.959
MATT: All right.

633
00:23:57.959 --> 00:23:59.977
MARISHA: Keeps clattering to the other side of the map.

634
00:23:59.977 --> 00:24:01.617
MATT: 18 points of bludgeoning damage to you.

635
00:24:01.617 --> 00:24:02.585
(thudding)

636
00:24:02.585 --> 00:24:06.015
As it impacts the armor, you guys hear a heavy (clang)

637
00:24:06.015 --> 00:24:07.777
as the front of her armor and shield

638
00:24:07.777 --> 00:24:09.996
takes the mass of the impact.

639
00:24:09.996 --> 00:24:11.585
She's thrown to the ground, knocked prone,

640
00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:13.625
but you get back up just barely--

641
00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:14.686
LAURA: I use Hellish Rebuke.

642
00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:16.417
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: Yeah, get it!

643
00:24:16.417 --> 00:24:17.250
LAURA: I scream at it--

644
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.633
oh, I don't know if this is going to work,

645
00:24:18.633 --> 00:24:20.246
but oh well, because it's undead,

646
00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:23.137
but whatever, I've already said it, I'm going to say:

647
00:24:23.137 --> 00:24:25.977
I thought jellyfishes were supposed to be so pretty!

648
00:24:25.977 --> 00:24:28.345
(awwing)

649
00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:30.402
Then I'm going to do--

650
00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:33.265
MATT: What's the save on that, dexterity?

651
00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:34.337
LAURA: Yeah.

652
00:24:34.337 --> 00:24:36.520
MATT: Natural seven fails.

653
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.470
LAURA: 3d10 cold damage.

654
00:24:43.228 --> 00:24:45.341
13, 15 points.

655
00:24:45.341 --> 00:24:48.331
MATT: All righty. After the impact, you push back, and

656
00:24:48.331 --> 00:24:50.861
shards of ice pierce in all these places

657
00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:53.861
and the ribcage is now exposed on one side

658
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:55.832
and the shards of ice break off.

659
00:24:55.832 --> 00:24:58.283
You now have all these different piercing thorns

660
00:24:58.283 --> 00:25:00.232
and spears of ice sticking into its torso,

661
00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:01.843
and it seems to grin back at you

662
00:25:01.843 --> 00:25:03.901
with its horrible torn, crooked smile.

663
00:25:03.901 --> 00:25:05.567
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

664
00:25:05.567 --> 00:25:08.142
MATT: That finishes its turn. Nott, you're up.

665
00:25:08.142 --> 00:25:11.192
SAM: First, I will undo my nine points of damage

666
00:25:11.192 --> 00:25:14.684
because I already used uncanny dodge as my reaction.

667
00:25:14.684 --> 00:25:16.200
MATT: Oh, that's right.

668
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.312
SAM: So that didn't happen, but--

669
00:25:17.312 --> 00:25:19.715
MATT: Well, you did swing, and it hit nothing.

670
00:25:19.715 --> 00:25:22.512
SAM: I will attack it now with my crossbow,

671
00:25:22.512 --> 00:25:24.571
because it's engaged with good ol' Jessie.

672
00:25:24.571 --> 00:25:25.404
MATT: It is.

673
00:25:25.404 --> 00:25:27.751
SAM: 17 plus a lot, that's 20 something.

674
00:25:27.751 --> 00:25:29.417
MATT: That definitely hits. You can roll damage.

675
00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:31.083
SAM: Yeah, yeah yeah.

676
00:25:31.083 --> 00:25:32.003
MATT: And Jester, you're up on deck.

677
00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:32.836
LAURA: Oh!

678
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:35.544
SAM: Okay.

679
00:25:35.544 --> 00:25:39.127
MATT: Actually, no, Soorna's up on next, sorry.

680
00:25:40.632 --> 00:25:42.226
SAM: Okay, 25 points of damage.

681
00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:44.906
MATT: 25, nice!

682
00:25:44.906 --> 00:25:48.187
SAM: Plus a bonus, I will, shit,

683
00:25:48.187 --> 00:25:50.294
I don't want him to hit me again.

684
00:25:50.294 --> 00:25:51.968
I will just shoot again.

685
00:25:51.968 --> 00:25:53.656
MATT: Go for it, another attack.

686
00:25:53.656 --> 00:25:56.086
SAM: 19 plus a lot, that definitely hits.

687
00:25:56.086 --> 00:25:59.709
Three plus another, nine points of damage!

688
00:25:59.709 --> 00:26:01.248
That's the nine that I undid!

689
00:26:01.248 --> 00:26:03.677
MARISHA: Nine!

690
00:26:03.677 --> 00:26:05.117
MATT: Look at that, perfect.

691
00:26:05.117 --> 00:26:09.636
SAM: I'll move into that corner and hug the wall, yep.

692
00:26:09.636 --> 00:26:10.837
MATT: You got it.

693
00:26:10.837 --> 00:26:12.057
Finishing that, now we go to Soorna's turn.

694
00:26:12.057 --> 00:26:14.667
Soorna, watching this corpse rise up,

695
00:26:14.667 --> 00:26:19.538
eyes wide in horror, goes, "I'm sorry friend."

696
00:26:19.538 --> 00:26:20.371
SAM: What?

697
00:26:21.314 --> 00:26:22.147
MATT: Recognizes--

698
00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:23.199
SAM: Oh, to him, not to us.

699
00:26:23.199 --> 00:26:24.450
MATT: No, not to you.

700
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.140
TRAVIS: Peace! (thudding)

701
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.898
MATT: She just steps on Caduceus.

702
00:26:30.898 --> 00:26:33.082
TALIESIN: Ah! Oh, my back!

703
00:26:33.082 --> 00:26:35.249
MATT: Is going to ...

704
00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:41.581
TRAVIS: Jump into the pit.

705
00:26:41.581 --> 00:26:43.391
MATT: --throw another rock.

706
00:26:43.391 --> 00:26:46.231
Reaches off to one of the beds on the side,

707
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.737
each of these beds, arranged here.

708
00:26:48.737 --> 00:26:50.682
Actually, sorry, these are tables.

709
00:26:50.682 --> 00:26:51.850
There's a section of the table on the side

710
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.041
where it's made up of smaller rocks.

711
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:55.330
She grabs a chunk of them, like three or four boulders

712
00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.671
and lugs them towards the creature, full might.

713
00:26:58.671 --> 00:27:00.810
(grunting)

714
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.089
Three of them rush towards it and do impact, barely.

715
00:27:05.089 --> 00:27:06.705
Barely.

716
00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:12.386
So full damage on that attack there.

717
00:27:15.732 --> 00:27:19.391
TRAVIS: We need a total "Let them fight" moment.

718
00:27:19.391 --> 00:27:20.641
Let them fight.

719
00:27:21.608 --> 00:27:24.441
MATT: 33 points of bludgeoning damage.

720
00:27:25.671 --> 00:27:28.591
The bones crack on the inside,

721
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:31.350
where they impact on the chin, it

722
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.088
breaks open a bit and the jaw's hanging to one side,

723
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:36.990
and the tongue is trying to reach down

724
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.358
and grab the jaw to pull it back into place.

725
00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:41.408
SAM: Gross.

726
00:27:41.408 --> 00:27:43.149
MATT: Soorna, after throwing the rocks,

727
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:44.979
she looks down towards you and she goes,

728
00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:47.189
"Be careful, follow,"

729
00:27:47.189 --> 00:27:51.018
and begins to step back into this portion.

730
00:27:51.018 --> 00:27:52.149
MARISHA: Follow?

731
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:54.728
MATT: Just to Caduceus. Seemingly like, protectively.

732
00:27:54.728 --> 00:27:56.179
That finished Soorna's turn.

733
00:27:56.179 --> 00:27:58.218
Jester, your go.

734
00:27:58.218 --> 00:27:59.593
LAURA: Okay.

735
00:27:59.593 --> 00:28:01.221
TRAVIS: You got it Jessie, come on!

736
00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:02.962
ASHLEY: Jessie!

737
00:28:02.962 --> 00:28:06.537
LAURA: I'm going to use...

738
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.611
I want to use Command, but I don't think

739
00:28:10.611 --> 00:28:14.355
that the jellyfish speaks English, so,

740
00:28:14.355 --> 00:28:19.355
I'm going to use Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level

741
00:28:19.963 --> 00:28:23.251
with my Pearl of Power,

742
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:27.904
and I'm going to grab ahold of his ankle,

743
00:28:27.904 --> 00:28:32.163
and say: I hope this hurts! And cast Inflict Wounds.

744
00:28:32.163 --> 00:28:33.464
MATT: All righty, roll for attack.

745
00:28:33.464 --> 00:28:35.539
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

746
00:28:37.453 --> 00:28:41.333
LAURA: Oh! Oh good, that's good! 23.

747
00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:42.933
MATT: 23 definitely hits, roll for damage.

748
00:28:42.933 --> 00:28:44.690
LAURA: Wait, that was 3rd-level!

749
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.120
Okay, wait, hold on, how many points is that?

750
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.772
5d10!

751
00:28:51.384 --> 00:28:54.333
I just don't, oh come on, motherfucker.

752
00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:55.672
SAM: Not terrible, not terrible.

753
00:28:55.672 --> 00:28:57.883
LAURA: Nine, 11.

754
00:28:57.883 --> 00:28:59.312
13 points.

755
00:28:59.312 --> 00:29:01.504
That was pretty shit.

756
00:29:01.504 --> 00:29:02.823
SAM: Slightly above average.

757
00:29:02.823 --> 00:29:04.913
MATT: What do you want, for, Inflict Wounds, you're doing?

758
00:29:04.913 --> 00:29:05.746
LAURA: Yeah.

759
00:29:05.746 --> 00:29:07.411
MATT: Inflict Wounds, I believe, is 3d10 damage.

760
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:11.958
LAURA: Oh no! It's 5d10, I was doing 5d6s.

761
00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:14.941
Ha ha!

762
00:29:15.942 --> 00:29:19.184
That's better. 19, 21, 22, no.

763
00:29:19.184 --> 00:29:22.940
20, 21, and then two more?

764
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.427
21, 29, 31.

765
00:29:27.427 --> 00:29:30.685
MATT: 31 points of damage, much better.

766
00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:34.227
You reach out and grab the leg of the

767
00:29:34.227 --> 00:29:36.443
horribly decomposing giant body.

768
00:29:36.443 --> 00:29:39.093
LAURA: That's necrotic damage. Motherfuck!

769
00:29:39.093 --> 00:29:41.505
MATT: It still manages to--its flesh

770
00:29:41.505 --> 00:29:43.864
tears up like the inside of its musculature

771
00:29:43.864 --> 00:29:46.027
and its leg, splits in seven different places

772
00:29:46.027 --> 00:29:49.245
and you watch as a black, thick, congealed giant blood

773
00:29:49.245 --> 00:29:52.077
bursts out and splatters on the stonework near,

774
00:29:52.077 --> 00:29:54.725
on your shield and part of your face,

775
00:29:54.725 --> 00:29:56.283
and its leg is now partially ruined.

776
00:29:56.283 --> 00:29:58.005
That did a decent chunk.

777
00:29:58.005 --> 00:29:59.485
ASHLEY: Yeah!

778
00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:00.660
MATT: That's your action.

779
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.934
LAURA: Okay.

780
00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:03.876
If I move away, he's going to get a swipe out of it,

781
00:30:03.876 --> 00:30:06.523
but I'm going to try it. I'm going to run away from him.

782
00:30:06.523 --> 00:30:07.426
MATT: All right, where are you running?

783
00:30:07.426 --> 00:30:09.397
LAURA: I don't want to be in this room alone with this guy!

784
00:30:09.397 --> 00:30:10.357
Are you here still?

785
00:30:10.357 --> 00:30:11.190
SAM: I'm here!

786
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.685
LAURA: Oh, never mind, I'm going to stay--

787
00:30:12.685 --> 00:30:14.176
SAM: No, go, I'm fine.

788
00:30:14.176 --> 00:30:15.405
MATT: What are you doing, Jester?

789
00:30:15.405 --> 00:30:18.174
LAURA: I'm going to step back towards the well.

790
00:30:18.174 --> 00:30:20.077
MATT: Towards the wall this way?

791
00:30:20.077 --> 00:30:20.986
LAURA: Towards the well.

792
00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:22.547
SAM: Towards the well behind her.

793
00:30:22.547 --> 00:30:23.517
MATT: Over here?

794
00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:24.907
LAURA: Actually no, I'm going to stay within his range.

795
00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:27.136
I'm going to stay within his range and

796
00:30:27.136 --> 00:30:28.107
yeah, go right there.

797
00:30:28.107 --> 00:30:29.267
SAM: She's going to move everywhere.

798
00:30:29.267 --> 00:30:30.477
LAURA: I'm going to move all over.

799
00:30:30.477 --> 00:30:33.157
What am I doing? What am I doing?

800
00:30:33.157 --> 00:30:35.547
You don't know, you don't know!

801
00:30:35.547 --> 00:30:37.506
MATT: Trickster cleric, what you going to do?

802
00:30:37.506 --> 00:30:40.250
TRAVIS: That's pretty much like the begging, too.

803
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.896
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

804
00:30:41.896 --> 00:30:46.896
TALIESIN: I'm going to yell: Guys, a little help in here!

805
00:30:46.896 --> 00:30:51.896
I'm going to back up a little bit behind Fjord,

806
00:30:51.896 --> 00:30:53.934
like right behind Fjord.

807
00:30:53.934 --> 00:30:56.024
Yeah, like so if something comes down the--

808
00:30:56.024 --> 00:30:59.254
like a couple steps forward--so that if something's...

809
00:30:59.254 --> 00:31:00.154
MATT: Good?

810
00:31:00.154 --> 00:31:01.170
TALIESIN: Yeah, that way if something's

811
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.261
shooting down the hall,

812
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:05.736
it's not going to hit at me. Just enough coverage for that,

813
00:31:05.736 --> 00:31:07.645
but so I can see everybody,

814
00:31:07.645 --> 00:31:11.574
and then I am going to hold my action

815
00:31:11.574 --> 00:31:15.092
for Yasha's go.

816
00:31:15.092 --> 00:31:15.932
MATT: What are you holding?

817
00:31:15.932 --> 00:31:18.599
TALIESIN: I'm holding the vulnerability.

818
00:31:19.682 --> 00:31:22.074
MATT: Oh, gotcha, to increase the--

819
00:31:22.074 --> 00:31:25.524
That finishes your turn, Caduceus.

820
00:31:25.524 --> 00:31:27.324
Caleb, you're up.

821
00:31:27.324 --> 00:31:29.063
You see your friends backing out and shouting behind you.

822
00:31:29.063 --> 00:31:31.543
LIAM: Hearing mayhem and the last thing Caduceus

823
00:31:31.543 --> 00:31:32.852
said was, "Guys, a little help here,"

824
00:31:32.852 --> 00:31:35.234
so I'm pulling things out of my pocket

825
00:31:35.234 --> 00:31:36.514
and running to see what's going on.

826
00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:40.112
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, holy shit.

827
00:31:40.112 --> 00:31:43.204
I pull out a bit of brimstone, tallow,

828
00:31:43.204 --> 00:31:46.684
and powdered iron and goo it into a tiny little super ball

829
00:31:46.684 --> 00:31:49.783
and spin it into a rasengan giant ball of fire

830
00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:51.823
that grows to about five feet wide

831
00:31:51.823 --> 00:31:53.114
and with a bit of the English,

832
00:31:53.114 --> 00:31:56.724
I spin a Flaming Sphere on a curve,

833
00:31:56.724 --> 00:32:00.557
along this way, and hit, level three.

834
00:32:00.557 --> 00:32:02.604
TRAVIS: Like the dopest bowler ever.

835
00:32:02.604 --> 00:32:07.452
MATT: It curves around, (thudding) arcs over,

836
00:32:07.452 --> 00:32:08.402
and dexterity saving throw

837
00:32:08.402 --> 00:32:10.235
I believe, right?

838
00:32:10.235 --> 00:32:11.688
LIAM: Yeah, that's correct.

839
00:32:11.688 --> 00:32:13.746
MATT: That's going to be--

840
00:32:13.746 --> 00:32:15.595
LIAM: It's 17 to beat.

841
00:32:15.595 --> 00:32:16.645
MATT: That's 18. Natural 16.

842
00:32:16.645 --> 00:32:18.278
LIAM: It beats it. It's half of.

843
00:32:18.278 --> 00:32:19.979
I'm doing it at 3rd-level, so half of 3d6.

844
00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:22.437
MATT: You got it.

845
00:32:22.437 --> 00:32:25.789
LIAM: Meh. Nine, so four or five?

846
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:27.648
MATT: There we go.

847
00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:28.854
Four points of fire damage.

848
00:32:28.854 --> 00:32:29.749
LIAM: But it's just sitting there.

849
00:32:29.749 --> 00:32:32.723
MATT: Correct, and you are now concentrating

850
00:32:32.723 --> 00:32:34.658
to keep that up. Did you have one previously?

851
00:32:34.658 --> 00:32:36.179
LIAM: Oh, a Fire Bolt, which is gone.

852
00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:38.416
MATT: Right, all right, so yeah, any of the spells

853
00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:41.273
that you were concentrating on are gone. You have that.

854
00:32:41.273 --> 00:32:42.840
All righty, so that finishes your go, Caleb.

855
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.739
LIAM: Correct.

856
00:32:43.739 --> 00:32:44.928
MATT: You still have your action.

857
00:32:44.928 --> 00:32:45.761
LIAM: That was the action,

858
00:32:45.761 --> 00:32:48.067
that's an action to cast it for the first time.

859
00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:49.085
MATT: That's right, the bonus action.

860
00:32:49.085 --> 00:32:51.006
LIAM: In the future, when I hurt it a different way,

861
00:32:51.006 --> 00:32:52.047
it will be a bonus action.

862
00:32:52.047 --> 00:32:53.013
MATT: You are correct.

863
00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:54.445
Cool, that finishes your go.

864
00:32:54.445 --> 00:32:55.493
Beau and Yasha.

865
00:32:55.493 --> 00:32:57.418
MARISHA: I'm going to peek around the corner of

866
00:32:57.418 --> 00:32:59.384
where I'm hiding,

867
00:32:59.384 --> 00:33:01.995
creep up a little bit and give a scan

868
00:33:01.995 --> 00:33:03.195
of this room in front of me,

869
00:33:03.195 --> 00:33:06.589
because I darted off and...

870
00:33:06.589 --> 00:33:09.304
I'm hearing a little bit of ruckus in the background.

871
00:33:09.304 --> 00:33:11.403
SAM: Ah! Save us, don't abandon us!

872
00:33:11.403 --> 00:33:14.346
(laughter)

873
00:33:14.346 --> 00:33:15.796
SAM: Why would you leave?!

874
00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:18.234
MATT: Opening to a chamber here.

875
00:33:18.234 --> 00:33:19.425
TRAVIS: Person I can't see!

876
00:33:21.184 --> 00:33:22.842
TALIESIN: She is giving off light.

877
00:33:22.842 --> 00:33:24.285
MATT: That's right, from the Holy--

878
00:33:24.285 --> 00:33:26.325
MARISHA: I've got goggles.

879
00:33:26.325 --> 00:33:30.275
MATT: This chamber here, you can see a series of stone beds

880
00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:31.815
that are laid out along the walls.

881
00:33:31.815 --> 00:33:32.917
MARISHA: Oh, comfy.

882
00:33:32.917 --> 00:33:35.916
MATT: You can see looking into this chamber here,

883
00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:36.816
at the opening there

884
00:33:36.816 --> 00:33:38.094
and it looks like it would be a tight squeeze

885
00:33:38.094 --> 00:33:41.307
for a stone giant and it's a somewhat round chamber.

886
00:33:41.307 --> 00:33:43.025
There's a little bit of glistening from the interior.

887
00:33:43.025 --> 00:33:45.216
You can see elements of the stone nearby reflects

888
00:33:45.216 --> 00:33:46.275
a little bit of the light.

889
00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:47.877
There's a little bit of moisture

890
00:33:47.877 --> 00:33:49.496
to the inside of the chamber.

891
00:33:49.496 --> 00:33:50.957
The little bit you can see down here,

892
00:33:50.957 --> 00:33:51.976
there's another hallway

893
00:33:51.976 --> 00:33:53.896
that also seems to carry another stone bed

894
00:33:53.896 --> 00:33:55.085
and that's about as far as you can see

895
00:33:55.085 --> 00:33:57.467
at a quick glance, so.

896
00:33:57.467 --> 00:34:00.300
TRAVIS: Are they beds or are they tombs?

897
00:34:01.836 --> 00:34:03.935
MARISHA: I turn around to Caleb, who I think is behind me,

898
00:34:03.935 --> 00:34:05.435
and I go: There--

899
00:34:07.084 --> 00:34:09.258
Then I start making my way back.

900
00:34:09.258 --> 00:34:12.008
MATT: Okay, so movement is five, ten.

901
00:34:12.883 --> 00:34:15.494
TRAVIS: ♪ Making my way back down. ♪

902
00:34:15.494 --> 00:34:18.244
ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way back to the big giant. ♪

ALL: ♪ "A Thousand Miles" by Vanessa Carlton ♪

904
00:34:24.984 --> 00:34:27.373
ASHLEY: Okay, it's my turn?

905
00:34:27.373 --> 00:34:29.250
MARISHA: Can I move any further?

906
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.491
MATT: You can bonus action Step of the Wind, if you want.

907

ASHLEY: ♪ He's got a jellyfish. ♪

908

LAURA: ♪ It's undead! ♪

910
00:34:36.821 --> 00:34:38.032
MATT: So Yasha, what are you doing?

911
00:34:38.032 --> 00:34:39.952
ASHLEY: Now I'm hearing that everybody needs help,

912
00:34:39.952 --> 00:34:41.661
I'm like: Ugh, goddamn it.

913
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:44.744
I'm going to run back in towards the--

914
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:47.506
towards the big baddie.

915
00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:49.861
Which I think it will get me to him.

916
00:34:49.861 --> 00:34:52.490
MATT: 30, 35, 40, gets you right up into,

917
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.461
next to the flaming sphere,

918
00:34:53.461 --> 00:34:54.640
I'd say probably move a little further away

919
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.930
so you're not right next to it.

920
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:57.930
The heat's a bit intense as you walk by

921
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.669
and you see the flames there, and you

922
00:34:59.669 --> 00:35:01.517
scoot around the edge, blade in the air.

923
00:35:01.517 --> 00:35:03.728
ASHLEY: Blade in the air, ready to go, I'm still raging?

924
00:35:03.728 --> 00:35:07.210
MATT: You haven't raged yet, since this battle started.

925
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.130
ASHLEY: Oh, true. I would like to rage.

926
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, you would walk into this (excited noises)!

927
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.741
MATT: You're ridiculous, Travis.

928
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:18.181
(laughter)

929
00:35:18.181 --> 00:35:19.308
ASHLEY: Say it again?

930
00:35:19.308 --> 00:35:21.558
TALIESIN: Roll damage for your first and double it.

931
00:35:22.901 --> 00:35:26.439
MATT: So all damage, not just the dice.

932
00:35:26.439 --> 00:35:29.800
Just roll the dice, add the amount of fire.

933
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.981
ASHLEY: Okay.

934
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:33.889
MATT: It would be a 3d6, plus whatever your.

935
00:35:33.889 --> 00:35:35.221
ASHLEY: 3d6?

936
00:35:35.221 --> 00:35:37.414
I don't roll for attack?

937
00:35:37.414 --> 00:35:39.255
MATT: You roll for attack.

938
00:35:39.255 --> 00:35:40.544
ASHLEY: 18?

939
00:35:40.544 --> 00:35:43.358
MATT: 18? 18 hits.

940
00:35:43.358 --> 00:35:45.753
TALIESIN: It just flipped on me.

941
00:35:45.753 --> 00:35:47.212
TRAVIS: Cool.

942
00:35:47.212 --> 00:35:48.329
MARISHA: "It flipped on me."

943
00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:49.970
LIAM: See if it can finish up before the turn comes around.

944
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.334
TALIESIN: Oh, I've got my next three turns planned,

945
00:35:52.334 --> 00:35:53.167
so I'm fine.

946
00:35:53.167 --> 00:35:54.742
ASHLEY: Okay.

947
00:35:54.742 --> 00:35:57.105
SAM: Eyy! It's back!

948
00:35:57.105 --> 00:36:00.196
ASHLEY: Okay, 15 for the first hit.

949
00:36:00.196 --> 00:36:02.188
MATT: 15 damage with the bonus?

950
00:36:02.188 --> 00:36:03.836
ASHLEY: What's the bonus again, I'm sorry?

951
00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:05.047
MATT: It's 15 and then it's doubled.

952
00:36:05.047 --> 00:36:07.007
ASHLEY: It's double that, so a 30.

953
00:36:07.007 --> 00:36:09.417
LIAM: She's back, she's back.

954
00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:11.999
ASHLEY: Hello!

955
00:36:11.999 --> 00:36:14.657
Knock knock, who's there, it's me.

956
00:36:14.657 --> 00:36:17.990
Okay, so and then, divine fury.

957
00:36:19.764 --> 00:36:21.514
MATT: Yasha, first off...

958
00:36:23.953 --> 00:36:25.633
Oh yeah, so divine fury is part of your first strike?

959
00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:30.466
ASHLEY: Divine fury is an extra eight.

960
00:36:31.334 --> 00:36:32.233
Yes.

961
00:36:32.233 --> 00:36:37.233
Is 1d6 and then plus four, plus half your level.

962
00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:39.553
MATT: Right.

963
00:36:39.553 --> 00:36:41.084
ASHLEY: I got something right!

964
00:36:41.084 --> 00:36:42.233
TALIESIN: Is that part of the first strike, too?

965
00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.066
MATT: It's part of the first strike.

966
00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:45.274
TALIESIN: So that is also doubled.

967
00:36:45.274 --> 00:36:46.119
MATT: How do you want to do this?

968
00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:48.261
(yelling)

969
00:36:48.261 --> 00:36:49.569
TRAVIS: Fuck yes!

970
00:36:49.569 --> 00:36:53.482
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to look back at Soorna

971
00:36:53.482 --> 00:36:55.992
and I'm going to say: I'm sorry.

972
00:36:55.992 --> 00:36:59.100
I'm going to take the Magician's Judge--

973
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.193
(slurred) Magician's Judge--

974
00:37:02.193 --> 00:37:04.672
and plunge it straight into the chest.

975
00:37:04.672 --> 00:37:07.582
Slowly and try to find the jellyfish as well.

976
00:37:07.582 --> 00:37:12.582
MATT: You plunge the blade up into its abdomen/torso area.

977
00:37:13.162 --> 00:37:15.432
You find the spinal cord, and as you put through,

978
00:37:15.432 --> 00:37:18.682
you twist it and the elements of the bone structure

979
00:37:18.682 --> 00:37:20.904
and anything that's holding its torso up

980
00:37:20.904 --> 00:37:23.933
(cracking) twists and folds forward.

981
00:37:23.933 --> 00:37:27.642
The whole corpse tumbles into a folded sandwich

982
00:37:27.642 --> 00:37:29.638
as it falls to the ground,

983
00:37:29.638 --> 00:37:34.638
leaving behind this mysterious jellyfish entity.

984
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.541
SAM: Is that thing still alive?

985
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:38.600
MATT: It slips out of its body

986
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.933
and you see it floating spectrally in the air.

987
00:37:41.933 --> 00:37:44.501
It's technically your second attack,

988
00:37:44.501 --> 00:37:45.579
if you wanted to take it,

989
00:37:45.579 --> 00:37:47.449
would be in the same place.

990
00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:49.921
ASHLEY: Yep. I'll take a second attack.

991
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:50.754
Okay.

992
00:37:52.951 --> 00:37:55.176
It's cocked.

993
00:37:55.176 --> 00:37:57.434
It's cocked.

994
00:37:59.467 --> 00:38:00.608
15?

995
00:38:00.608 --> 00:38:02.517
MATT: 15 does hit.

996
00:38:02.517 --> 00:38:04.726
TRAVIS: Oh! Go on, now.

997
00:38:04.726 --> 00:38:05.867
SAM: Double kill.

998
00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:07.357
ASHLEY: Here we go.

999
00:38:07.357 --> 00:38:09.597
TRAVIS: Double prizes.

1000
00:38:09.597 --> 00:38:11.155
ASHLEY: Seven...

1001
00:38:13.964 --> 00:38:16.735
I actually didn't add enough that last round,

1002
00:38:16.735 --> 00:38:17.725
but that's fine.

1003
00:38:17.725 --> 00:38:21.102
MATT: It didn't matter, you killed it.

1004
00:38:21.102 --> 00:38:22.860
TALIESIN: Paste.

1005
00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:25.925
ASHLEY: 14.

1006
00:38:25.925 --> 00:38:27.565
MATT: 14.

1007
00:38:27.565 --> 00:38:28.713
LAURA: Is that still doubled?

1008
00:38:28.713 --> 00:38:30.863
TALIESIN: No.

1009
00:38:30.863 --> 00:38:33.416
First hit only.

1010
00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:34.632
MATT: So Yasha--

1011
00:38:34.632 --> 00:38:35.852
SAM: How do you want to--

1012
00:38:35.852 --> 00:38:39.904
MATT: No. As it withdraws from the corpse,

1013
00:38:39.904 --> 00:38:41.482
you pull the blade out and then swing up

1014
00:38:41.482 --> 00:38:43.502
with the momentum of you drawing it out of its body

1015
00:38:43.502 --> 00:38:44.833
and it cuts through.

1016
00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:45.666
It tries to dodge out of the way,

1017
00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:47.073
and you watch the blade strike

1018
00:38:47.073 --> 00:38:48.363
and send it spinning for a second.

1019
00:38:48.363 --> 00:38:50.131
It comes back and rights itself.

1020
00:38:50.131 --> 00:38:53.083
(growling)

1021
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:54.371
ASHLEY: Does it look like it was hurt?

1022
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:55.822
MATT: It took a little damage.

1023
00:38:55.822 --> 00:38:57.290
ASHLEY: Okay.

1024
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:58.302
LIAM: Does it have little eye stalks in there?

1025
00:38:58.302 --> 00:38:59.620
TRAVIS: It is not your pet, Jester.

1026
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.851
It is not a pet.

1027
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:01.698
LAURA: I don't like it.

1028
00:39:01.698 --> 00:39:02.731
MATT: It's almost adorable.

1029
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:04.833
TALIESIN: It's a bad jellyfish, bad.

1030
00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:06.912
MATT: Now I believe that finishes your turn, though, right?

1031
00:39:06.912 --> 00:39:08.803
ASHLEY: Yes, it does. I'll stay there.

1032
00:39:08.803 --> 00:39:11.883
MATT: All right, Fjord, you're up.

1033
00:39:11.883 --> 00:39:13.964
TRAVIS: Can I see the jellyfish pop out of the carcass

1034
00:39:13.964 --> 00:39:15.956
that Yasha just carved?

1035
00:39:15.956 --> 00:39:20.870
I'll send two swaths of Eldritch Blast at it.

1036
00:39:21.752 --> 00:39:23.583
MATT: Get your Eldritch Blast.

1037
00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:25.606
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast!

1038
00:39:25.606 --> 00:39:27.276
That's a natural one.

1039
00:39:27.276 --> 00:39:28.734
(groaning)

1040
00:39:28.734 --> 00:39:30.355
MATT: The first one you (groaning)

1041
00:39:30.355 --> 00:39:31.344
and it hits the wall next to you,

1042
00:39:31.344 --> 00:39:33.261
spraying you with--

1043
00:39:33.261 --> 00:39:35.503
TALIESIN: That's tough.

1044
00:39:35.503 --> 00:39:37.053
TRAVIS: I got the call out wrong.

1045
00:39:37.053 --> 00:39:39.497
Eldritch Blast!

1046
00:39:39.497 --> 00:39:40.330
19!

1047
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:41.163
MATT: 19 hits!

1048
00:39:41.163 --> 00:39:43.830
(cheering)

1049
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:46.343
TRAVIS: 1d10 plus five.

1050
00:39:46.343 --> 00:39:49.585
12 points of Eldritch Blast damage.

1051
00:39:50.869 --> 00:39:51.885
MATT: Nice.

1052
00:39:51.885 --> 00:39:52.812
(explosion)

1053
00:39:52.812 --> 00:39:54.831
The eldritch force blasts into it,

1054
00:39:54.831 --> 00:39:56.151
knocking it back about two feet,

1055
00:39:56.151 --> 00:39:57.161
it's still floating in the air.

1056
00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.343
It's looking hurt.

1057
00:39:58.343 --> 00:39:59.671
TRAVIS: Okay, nice.

1058
00:39:59.671 --> 00:40:00.903
MATT: That finish your turn?

1059
00:40:00.903 --> 00:40:04.943
TRAVIS: For my movement, I will go up and join Beau,

1060
00:40:04.943 --> 00:40:05.822
I'm pretty sure they can handle

1061
00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:07.271
whatever's going on in that room.

1062
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:10.961
MATT: You got it. That finishes your turn.

1063
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:11.794
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1064
00:40:11.794 --> 00:40:12.761
MATT: It is now the jellyfish's turn.

1065
00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:14.500
The jellyfish, looking somewhat damaged,

1066
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.932
in the vicinity of Yasha,

1067
00:40:15.932 --> 00:40:20.011
sits there and begins to pulse and glow.

1068
00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:20.844
TRAVIS: What?

1069
00:40:20.844 --> 00:40:22.200
MATT: Next to it,

1070
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.710
this strange little purple doorway opens up

1071
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.379
and it jumps into and closes and it vanishes.

1072
00:40:29.379 --> 00:40:31.800
LAURA: It Dimension Doored?

1073
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.719
MATT: It Dimension Doored.

1074
00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:33.891
ASHLEY: Do I get an attack of opportunity?

1075
00:40:33.891 --> 00:40:36.290
MATT: No, because it didn't move or leave your range.

1076
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.540
It teleported, technically.

1077
00:40:39.819 --> 00:40:40.659
ASHLEY: Damn it!

1078
00:40:40.659 --> 00:40:42.028
MARISHA: Why does everything escape from us?

1079
00:40:42.028 --> 00:40:43.703
LAURA: Wait! If it Dimension Doored,

1080
00:40:43.703 --> 00:40:47.113
that means it's going somewhere else within 500 feet!

1081
00:40:47.113 --> 00:40:48.400
TRAVIS: 500 feet?

1082
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.898
LIAM: Magic door.

1083
00:40:49.898 --> 00:40:51.239
LAURAL Yeah, that's what Dimension Door is.

1084
00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:53.047
LIAM: That's (whooshing), I thought.

1085
00:40:53.047 --> 00:40:55.864
MATT: It was a descriptor of Dimension Door.

1086
00:40:55.864 --> 00:40:57.098
TALIESIN: Everyone got flavor.

1087
00:40:57.098 --> 00:41:01.677
MATT: There's a moment, the ball of fire's crackling there,

1088
00:41:01.677 --> 00:41:03.586
everyone's, (panting).

1089
00:41:03.586 --> 00:41:05.352
TALIESIN: It's not gone.

1090
00:41:05.352 --> 00:41:06.642
MARISHA: What's happening?

1091
00:41:06.642 --> 00:41:07.826
What was it?

1092
00:41:07.826 --> 00:41:11.586
TALIESIN: It's going to be coming forth with something else.

1093
00:41:11.586 --> 00:41:15.481
I'm going to just--

1094
00:41:15.481 --> 00:41:17.648
I'm just keeping my eyes bloody open.

1095
00:41:17.648 --> 00:41:21.155
MARISHA: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

1096
00:41:21.155 --> 00:41:24.602
MARISHA: I think there's sarcophagus, over here.

1097
00:41:24.602 --> 00:41:27.663
TALIESIN: Why would there be coffins in here?

1098
00:41:27.663 --> 00:41:28.496
MARISHA: I don't know.

1099
00:41:28.496 --> 00:41:30.496
They're either beds or really big coffins.

1100
00:41:30.496 --> 00:41:31.329
TALIESIN: Would make more sense

1101
00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.554
if they were beds in here, right?

1102
00:41:32.554 --> 00:41:34.983
LAURA: This is where stone giants lived, after all.

1103
00:41:34.983 --> 00:41:36.093
TRAVIS: Made out of stone?

1104
00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:38.459
LIAM: DM, I know that I can make

1105
00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:39.410
the flaming sphere jump things,

1106
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:43.302
so can I make it spin and spiral down this tube of bones

1107
00:41:43.302 --> 00:41:45.892
and burn up all the bones that are in there?

1108
00:41:45.892 --> 00:41:50.892
MATT: It can--I mean, bones don't--it would take a while--

1109
00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:53.791
LIAM: That's fine, I'm going to set whatever I can on fire

1110
00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:55.082
because I'm a fire bug.

1111
00:41:55.082 --> 00:41:56.391
MATT: Okay.

1112
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:58.663
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to go watch him--

1113
00:41:58.663 --> 00:42:00.441
TALIESIN: Since nothing seems to be happening,

1114
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:05.441
I'm going to turn my way,

1115
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.279
and like look around the corner,

1116
00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:09.279
I'm going to cast Daylight right at the entrance of this

1117
00:42:09.279 --> 00:42:11.109
fucking, light this room up right here.

1118
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:13.630
MATT: Okay. As you're walking over.

1119
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.571
TALIESIN: I'm like, five feet.

1120
00:42:15.571 --> 00:42:16.668
MATT: Five feet and you cast Daylight?

1121
00:42:16.668 --> 00:42:18.749
TALIESIN: Yeah (explosions), 60 feet away.

1122
00:42:18.749 --> 00:42:19.905
MATT: 60 feet away, into this area?

1123
00:42:19.905 --> 00:42:20.738
TALIESIN: Yep.

1124
00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:24.817
MATT: All right, yeah. You open up another chamber

1125
00:42:24.817 --> 00:42:29.394
with a series of stone beds that are--

1126
00:42:29.394 --> 00:42:30.436
SAM: Sarcophagi.

1127
00:42:30.436 --> 00:42:34.377
MATT: You can see another chamber with a pool of water.

1128
00:42:34.377 --> 00:42:35.464
SAM: Indoor pool!

1129
00:42:35.464 --> 00:42:37.846
MATT: And a wide staircase that ascends--

1130
00:42:37.846 --> 00:42:39.575
TRAVIS: To nowhere?

1131
00:42:39.575 --> 00:42:41.505
MARISHA: It goes to the diving board.

1132
00:42:41.505 --> 00:42:44.577
ASHLEY: Yeah, go to it and jump off.

1133
00:42:44.577 --> 00:42:46.857
MATT: That's all lit up for you.

1134
00:42:46.857 --> 00:42:48.686
You are sending the flaming sphere down, it jumps,

1135
00:42:48.686 --> 00:42:51.305
(crackling) it begins to burn through--

1136
00:42:51.305 --> 00:42:53.537
LIAM: 45 seconds max, then it's gone.

1137
00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:56.170
MATT: Right. Gotcha.

1138
00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.033
Okay, well it goes for about ten seconds

1139
00:42:58.033 --> 00:43:01.537
before you start hearing (snarling)

1140
00:43:01.537 --> 00:43:04.450
down in the inside of the bones.

1141
00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.836
Do you keep burning?

1142
00:43:05.836 --> 00:43:06.669
LIAM: Absolutely.

1143
00:43:06.669 --> 00:43:07.943
LAURA: Wait, what is it?

1144
00:43:07.943 --> 00:43:09.068
Can you hear me?
SAM: Hello!

1145
00:43:09.068 --> 00:43:11.294
TRAVIS: Those aren't prisoners that we're killing right?

1146
00:43:11.294 --> 00:43:13.153
MATT: Roll damage for the flaming sphere.

1147
00:43:13.153 --> 00:43:14.794
TALIESIN: We don't know.

1148
00:43:14.794 --> 00:43:17.998
ASHLEY: It might be those weird cockroach things.

1149
00:43:17.998 --> 00:43:20.624
LIAM: 12. It would be a dex save for whatever's in there.

1150
00:43:20.624 --> 00:43:21.633
MATT: Yes, it rolled a two.

1151
00:43:21.633 --> 00:43:26.633
You watch as a tiny, filthy,

1152
00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:32.090
scared, filth-covered goblin

1153
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.812
that appeared to have been living inside

1154
00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:36.770
this bone pit, is trying to scramble out

1155
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.063
before it incinerates and burns to death.

1156
00:43:39.063 --> 00:43:41.474
LIAM: As soon as I see it, I drop the spell.

1157
00:43:41.474 --> 00:43:42.994
MATT: It did enough damage in the first round.

1158
00:43:42.994 --> 00:43:44.324
It's a goblin, I'm sorry.

1159
00:43:44.324 --> 00:43:46.004
It immediately incinerates.

1160
00:43:46.004 --> 00:43:48.323
(groaning)

1161
00:43:48.323 --> 00:43:50.148
TALIESIN: That'll happen.

1162
00:43:50.148 --> 00:43:54.284
MATT: It's smoldering amongst the rest of the bones.

1163
00:43:54.284 --> 00:43:56.867
TALIESIN: Sometimes a bird flies in your windshield.

1164
00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:58.644
It sucks.

1165
00:43:58.644 --> 00:44:01.367
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Sometimes you're the windshield.

1166
00:44:01.367 --> 00:44:02.587
(paper tearing)

1167
00:44:02.587 --> 00:44:03.697
(screaming)

1168
00:44:03.697 --> 00:44:07.132
TRAVIS: No fucking way! It can't happen twice!

1169
00:44:07.132 --> 00:44:08.874
SAM: Is it dead, dead, we can't revive it?

1170
00:44:08.874 --> 00:44:10.034
MATT: No, that shit's dead.

1171
00:44:10.034 --> 00:44:11.644
ASHLEY: Wait, we can't talk to it?

1172
00:44:11.644 --> 00:44:12.884
MATT: It had eight hit points.

1173
00:44:12.884 --> 00:44:13.800
LAURA: No, Caleb killed it!

1174
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.417
ASHLEY: No, that's really dead?

1175
00:44:15.417 --> 00:44:17.274
TRAVIS: Was that a real sheet tear?

1176
00:44:17.274 --> 00:44:19.124
TALIESIN: We'd have to figure out what parts are it,

1177
00:44:19.124 --> 00:44:21.303
because there's so many different parts in there.

1178
00:44:21.303 --> 00:44:24.223
That's a cornucopia of lost dreams.

1179
00:44:24.223 --> 00:44:27.354
TRAVIS: Can't one of y'all, like, la la?

1180
00:44:27.354 --> 00:44:28.914
TALIESIN: There are like, 50 dead things in there,

1181
00:44:28.914 --> 00:44:30.794
we'd have to figure out what parts are the right parts

1182
00:44:30.794 --> 00:44:33.114
and the right parts that actually can make mouth noises.

1183
00:44:33.114 --> 00:44:36.764
MATT: The top layer, because it's dense bones,

1184
00:44:36.764 --> 00:44:38.770
there's different sizes of bones, it's a bone pit,

1185
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:40.884
and you get the sense of this chamber looking at the tables,

1186
00:44:40.884 --> 00:44:43.074
that that pit, that was probably where

1187
00:44:43.074 --> 00:44:46.594
whatever the giants ate that had a skeleton and anything,

1188
00:44:46.594 --> 00:44:48.612
any remnants and garbage, it got thrown into this pit,

1189
00:44:48.612 --> 00:44:51.132
so it is this awful rot pit.

1190
00:44:51.132 --> 00:44:53.284
Whatever was not devoured,

1191
00:44:53.284 --> 00:44:55.807
it was left over from the meals of these giants over time.

1192
00:44:55.807 --> 00:44:59.452
LIAM: Oh you guys, I think I just killed a goblin.

1193
00:44:59.452 --> 00:45:01.183
ASHLEY: I saw him, Caleb, I saw it.

1194
00:45:01.183 --> 00:45:04.823
SAM: There's so many conflicting emotions right now.

1195
00:45:04.823 --> 00:45:06.714
ASHLEY: It was probably going to try to kill us.

1196
00:45:06.714 --> 00:45:08.205
LIAM: I was looking for--

1197
00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:09.575
LAURA: He looked pretty scared.

1198
00:45:09.575 --> 00:45:11.516
MARISHA: Wait, Caduceus, what happened?

1199
00:45:11.516 --> 00:45:15.354
TALIESIN: Oh, may have accidentally burned a goblin to--

1200
00:45:15.354 --> 00:45:20.354
SAM: Maybe in general, Caleb, don't burn things on fire

1201
00:45:20.865 --> 00:45:23.288
that you don't know what they are.

1202
00:45:23.288 --> 00:45:24.396
LIAM: Well we just got attacked

1203
00:45:24.396 --> 00:45:25.554
by a bunch of terrible stuff in here.

1204
00:45:25.554 --> 00:45:27.354
SAM: Also, it was a goblin,

1205
00:45:27.354 --> 00:45:30.364
it was probably a nasty little creature.

1206
00:45:30.364 --> 00:45:31.706
LAURA: Some goblins are not.

1207
00:45:31.706 --> 00:45:34.135
TALIESIN: Let's continue down this path, here.

1208
00:45:34.135 --> 00:45:35.634
MATT: Make a perception check, Caleb.

1209
00:45:35.634 --> 00:45:37.434
(laughter)

1210
00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.426
TALIESIN: Don't want to get stuck in this.

1211
00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:40.594
LIAM: That is a one.

1212
00:45:40.594 --> 00:45:43.746
MATT: Okay. Cool. What are you guys doing?

1213
00:45:43.746 --> 00:45:45.714
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and bring,

1214
00:45:45.714 --> 00:45:48.853
also what is that weird ass statue?

1215
00:45:48.853 --> 00:45:53.576
TRAVIS: Can I lean back to Landspeaker Soorna and say:

1216
00:45:53.576 --> 00:45:57.284
Assuming we're safe to move forward, can you, (groaning)

1217
00:45:57.284 --> 00:46:02.215
inform what lies ahead in terms of space and stuff?

1218
00:46:02.215 --> 00:46:03.825
LAURA: Fjord, are you okay?

1219
00:46:03.825 --> 00:46:07.434
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just feel, you know, half.

1220
00:46:07.434 --> 00:46:10.786
MATT: Soorna looks down at you and goes, "Small orc man,

1221
00:46:10.786 --> 00:46:15.786
"this room above is where we keep the well water

1222
00:46:15.986 --> 00:46:19.863
"and above that is the seeing chamber."

1223
00:46:19.863 --> 00:46:21.615
TRAVIS: The seeing chamber?

1224
00:46:21.615 --> 00:46:24.586
MATT: "For where I do my meditation."

1225
00:46:24.586 --> 00:46:25.914
Which is translating through you,

1226
00:46:25.914 --> 00:46:26.747
since you're the only one who speaks Giant.

1227
00:46:26.747 --> 00:46:30.051
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. Meditation room.

1228
00:46:30.051 --> 00:46:31.822
MARISHA: I want to move down and start scouting.

1229
00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:34.769
TRAVIS: She called me small?

1230
00:46:34.769 --> 00:46:36.421
TALIESIN: It's all relative, man.

1231
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:40.510
What is that weird statue right there, out of curiosity?

1232
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:42.481
MATT: Okay, you walk into the chamber where it was before.

1233
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:45.310
There's the still the skeletal body of the torn apart giant,

1234
00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:47.382
mostly picked clean of all flesh.

1235
00:46:47.382 --> 00:46:49.622
Inside this room, you can see a number

1236
00:46:49.622 --> 00:46:52.609
of large-sized stone cutting tools.

1237
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:56.771
There is a table and partially finished sculptures,

1238
00:46:56.771 --> 00:47:00.839
a few pretty near finished, decent art pieces,

1239
00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:05.422
that are like sculptures of creatures or arms or forms,

1240
00:47:06.519 --> 00:47:08.102
that statue that you see on the side there

1241
00:47:08.102 --> 00:47:09.435
appears to be...

1242
00:47:12.064 --> 00:47:14.402
a very thick stone giant

1243
00:47:14.402 --> 00:47:17.271
that is holding a sphere in its hand.

1244
00:47:17.271 --> 00:47:20.563
It's simple, but well made.

1245
00:47:20.563 --> 00:47:24.535
TALIESIN: It's not giving me any kind of vibe, I don't know?

1246
00:47:24.535 --> 00:47:26.235
MATT: Make a religion check.

1247
00:47:26.235 --> 00:47:27.068
TRAVIS: Getting turned on?

1248
00:47:28.407 --> 00:47:31.357
TALIESIN: God above. Six.

1249
00:47:32.202 --> 00:47:33.335
MATT: Nothing particular, unfortunately.

1250
00:47:33.335 --> 00:47:34.600
TALIESIN: It's all one material,

1251
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.950
it's not mixed media or anything?

1252
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.116
MATT: Correct.

1253
00:47:37.116 --> 00:47:39.387
TALIESIN: The orb's just an orb of the same stone?

1254
00:47:39.387 --> 00:47:41.096
MATT: Yeah. From the best you can tell,

1255
00:47:41.096 --> 00:47:43.750
it's whatever stone it was carved from--

1256
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.288
TALIESIN: All right, let's head forward,

1257
00:47:46.288 --> 00:47:48.139
we got to keep moving on this thing.

1258
00:47:48.139 --> 00:47:50.138
MARISHA: Yeah, while this thing was happening,

1259
00:47:50.138 --> 00:47:52.480
I, Beau, kind of snuck off.

1260
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.950
I lean over to Fjord, I'm like: I'm going to go.

1261
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.120
And then I go.

1262
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.179
TRAVIS: Reconnoiter.

1263
00:47:57.179 --> 00:47:59.168
TALIESIN: Let's move everybody through this.

1264
00:47:59.168 --> 00:48:00.918
LAURA: Well, hold on.

1265
00:48:01.872 --> 00:48:02.928
LIAM: I have a question, too.

1266
00:48:02.928 --> 00:48:04.600
It's probably just flavor at this point,

1267
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.839
but having just killed a humanoid with fire?

1268
00:48:06.839 --> 00:48:09.112
MATT: Yes, make a wisdom save.

1269
00:48:09.112 --> 00:48:10.112
MARISHA: I'm going.

1270
00:48:12.311 --> 00:48:14.228
LIAM: Oh, that's very high.

1271
00:48:15.067 --> 00:48:17.718
Probably good, that is a 20.

1272
00:48:17.718 --> 00:48:20.310
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. It's a goblin.

1273
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.976
LIAM and SAM: Hmm.

1274
00:48:25.019 --> 00:48:25.852
TALIESIN: So yeah.

1275
00:48:25.852 --> 00:48:28.260
MATT: I know. You guys begin to move slowly forward?

1276
00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.660
TRAVIS: Beau does.

1277
00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.500
MARISHA: I want to scout ahead first,

1278
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.942
while that conversation was happening.

1279
00:48:33.942 --> 00:48:35.951
MATT: Okay. The rest of you doing anything?

1280
00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:38.433
TALIESIN: I'm heading in that direction as well.

1281
00:48:38.433 --> 00:48:40.441
MATT: Okay, we'll put you guys moving over in this--

1282
00:48:40.441 --> 00:48:45.441
TALIESIN: I want to hang around the door over there.

1283
00:48:47.528 --> 00:48:51.219
LIAM: Caleb grabs Nott by the hand and walks out--

1284
00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:55.240
SAM: No! Are you going to burn me, too?

1285
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.939
TRAVIS: Jester, did you get smacked up?

1286
00:48:56.939 --> 00:48:58.981
LAURA: Just a little bit.

1287
00:49:01.323 --> 00:49:03.581
MARISHA: I'm going to very stealthily

1288
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:04.571
peek around that corner.

1289
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:05.671
SAM: You're not great about--

1290
00:49:05.671 --> 00:49:06.504
MATT: Make a perception check.

1291
00:49:06.504 --> 00:49:08.211
SAM: --killing innocent things with your fire.

1292
00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:09.221
MARISHA: Stealthily.

1293
00:49:09.221 --> 00:49:12.005
SAM: I hate goblins, but I'm starting to like them.

1294
00:49:12.005 --> 00:49:13.547
MARISHA: 13.

1295
00:49:13.547 --> 00:49:14.780
MATT: 13?

1296
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:19.527
Okay, you see four to five

1297
00:49:19.527 --> 00:49:23.127
of these stone slabs that have layers on top of it

1298
00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:27.888
of stitched together leather and wool

1299
00:49:27.888 --> 00:49:29.048
and dirty materials

1300
00:49:29.048 --> 00:49:32.470
that basically are set up to be bedding.

1301
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.099
Do you?

1302
00:49:34.099 --> 00:49:36.230
That's all you've seen, there's no other creatures

1303
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:39.568
that you can make out in the interior.

1304
00:49:39.568 --> 00:49:42.175
MARISHA: Okay. Nothing on this side?

1305
00:49:42.175 --> 00:49:43.558
MATT: You come over to this side.

1306
00:49:43.558 --> 00:49:44.700
Looks like more of the same.

1307
00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.510
MARISHA: More of the same? I peek into the room.

1308
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:51.510
MATT: Okay. You can see there's the well water below.

1309
00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:57.175
The smell of it here is still hard water,

1310
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.890
you don't know if this is fed by rain run off after a storm

1311
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:03.398
or if they actually bring the water here

1312
00:50:03.398 --> 00:50:05.200
or if there is a still water source

1313
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.377
that fills from underneath.

1314
00:50:06.377 --> 00:50:09.169
You don't see any openings in the vicinity

1315
00:50:09.169 --> 00:50:11.670
that seems to feed this water, but it is a well.

1316
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:15.528
It is a source of water, you're assuming fresh.

1317
00:50:15.528 --> 00:50:18.538
There is the staircase that leads upward

1318
00:50:18.538 --> 00:50:22.060
and the rest of the chamber seems relatively nondescript.

1319
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.580
LAURA: I did a Cure Wounds on myself.

1320
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.413
MATT: Okay.

1321
00:50:24.413 --> 00:50:27.089
Soorna actually looks around and says,

1322
00:50:27.089 --> 00:50:29.580
"Is anyone hurting bad?"

1323
00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:30.580
Which you.

1324
00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.241
TALIESIN: I got a little bit, we have a couple people

1325
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:33.281
that could use a little--

1326
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:35.548
ASHLEY: I think he can needs to be--

1327
00:50:35.548 --> 00:50:36.424
LAURA: I could use some healing.

1328
00:50:36.424 --> 00:50:38.057
MARISHA: I could use some.

1329
00:50:38.057 --> 00:50:39.991
TALIESIN: He needs greater though, so.

1330
00:50:39.991 --> 00:50:41.968
MATT: Soorna walks up and reaches out

1331
00:50:41.968 --> 00:50:43.430
and that large giant hand of hers reaches out

1332
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:47.366
and wraps around your shoulders and palms you

1333
00:50:47.366 --> 00:50:51.268
like a Harlem Globetrotter palms a basketball.

1334
00:50:51.268 --> 00:50:53.577
Does cast Cure Wounds at 2nd-level.

1335
00:50:53.577 --> 00:50:55.412
TRAVIS: Sports ref.

1336
00:50:55.412 --> 00:50:56.791
MATT: I do know those occasionally.

1337
00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:58.616
TRAVIS: I approve.

1338
00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:03.618
MATT: That would be 12 hit points you heal.

1339
00:51:03.618 --> 00:51:07.236
LAURA: Oh, wow, thank you.

1340
00:51:07.236 --> 00:51:10.543
MATT: Just going to cast another 2nd-level one--

1341
00:51:10.543 --> 00:51:12.713
TALIESIN: Nott could probably use some.

1342
00:51:12.713 --> 00:51:13.546
TRAVIS: We're just moving on, yeah?

1343
00:51:13.546 --> 00:51:15.937
We're not taking a moment to breathe?

1344
00:51:15.937 --> 00:51:16.987
MATT: 14 hit points.

1345
00:51:16.987 --> 00:51:19.107
TALIESIN: We lose your power, we lose your fists,

1346
00:51:19.107 --> 00:51:22.640
if we take a moment to breathe.

1347
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.057
ASHLEY: Fjord, how are you doing?

1348
00:51:24.057 --> 00:51:24.890
TRAVIS: Huh?

1349
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.465
ASHLEY: How are you doing?

1350
00:51:26.465 --> 00:51:30.547
TRAVIS: I still feel half of my normal self, but--

1351
00:51:30.547 --> 00:51:32.086
LAURA: We need something better

1352
00:51:32.086 --> 00:51:33.886
than just a Cure Wounds for you, though.

1353
00:51:33.886 --> 00:51:36.240
TRAVIS: Damn thing fucked me up.

1354
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.675
TALIESIN: It's going to take a night's sleep.

1355
00:51:38.675 --> 00:51:40.966
TRAVIS: Shook me real good, rattled my cage.

1356
00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:42.755
SAM: Just hang back for the rest of this.

1357
00:51:42.755 --> 00:51:43.795
TALIESIN: Hang near me.

1358
00:51:43.795 --> 00:51:45.435
SAM: Hang back.

1359
00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:47.334
TALIESIN: Stick near me, you'll be fine.

1360
00:51:47.334 --> 00:51:48.875
TRAVIS: All right.

1361
00:51:48.875 --> 00:51:51.497
I got all the icicles on me.

1362
00:51:51.497 --> 00:51:53.580
LIAM: I also walk over to Fjord,

1363
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.656
place my hand on his shoulder,

1364
00:51:55.656 --> 00:52:00.656
and I cast, oh I grab the leather around my thigh

1365
00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:02.475
and tug on it and mutter a few words

1366
00:52:02.475 --> 00:52:05.745
and add Mage Armor to Fjord's AC,

1367
00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:08.385
so you have two more added on to your AC, Fjord.

1368
00:52:08.385 --> 00:52:10.137
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ooh!

1369
00:52:10.137 --> 00:52:13.065
LIAM: Oh no, it becomes 13 plus his dex modifier.

1370
00:52:13.065 --> 00:52:14.831
MATT: Correct.

1371
00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:15.955
TRAVIS: My dex or your dex?

1372
00:52:15.955 --> 00:52:16.993
LIAM: Your dex.

1373
00:52:16.993 --> 00:52:19.210
TRAVIS: My dex mod is a big fat zero.

1374
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.168
LIAM: Oh boy.

1375
00:52:20.168 --> 00:52:23.068
MATT: Mage Armor does not help Fjord.

1376
00:52:23.068 --> 00:52:27.401
LIAM: Waste of a slot. Sorry, big guy.

1377
00:52:27.401 --> 00:52:28.886
MATT: Also, your fingers go a little numb,

1378
00:52:28.886 --> 00:52:31.606
as touching the side of Fjord, the frost armor

1379
00:52:31.606 --> 00:52:34.184
that's currently encased around his chest and torso area

1380
00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.966
causes your fingers to stick for a second,

1381
00:52:35.966 --> 00:52:37.195
you have to pull them back.

1382
00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:38.536
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry about that!

1383
00:52:38.536 --> 00:52:40.786
LIAM: No good deed.

1384
00:52:41.689 --> 00:52:43.382
TALIESIN: I'd like to move forward and inspect this room

1385
00:52:43.382 --> 00:52:44.366
and give it a good,

1386
00:52:44.366 --> 00:52:46.686
if everyone else would like to come along as well.

1387
00:52:46.686 --> 00:52:48.315
ASHLEY: Yes, let's move forward.

1388
00:52:48.315 --> 00:52:50.616
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think we are going to be going upstairs.

1389
00:52:50.616 --> 00:52:52.297
MARISHA: Yeah, since I was first in the room,

1390
00:52:52.297 --> 00:52:54.217
I'll start peeking up around the stairs.

1391
00:52:54.217 --> 00:52:55.955
LAURA: Can I look in the water?

1392
00:52:55.955 --> 00:52:58.095
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

1393
00:52:58.095 --> 00:53:00.315
TALIESIN: I would also like to look in the water.

1394
00:53:00.315 --> 00:53:01.915
LAURA: Ooh!

1395
00:53:03.097 --> 00:53:04.665
24.

1396
00:53:04.665 --> 00:53:07.248
MATT: Okay, Caduceus?

1397
00:53:10.306 --> 00:53:12.499
TALIESIN: I was going to look, too, yeah.

1398
00:53:12.499 --> 00:53:14.528
I like to roll, so good.

1399
00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:16.970
That's--yeah, 26.

1400
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:18.518
MATT: Okay.

1401
00:53:18.518 --> 00:53:21.268
Glancing down in the pool,

1402
00:53:22.546 --> 00:53:25.187
it's not the cleanest water necessarily,

1403
00:53:25.187 --> 00:53:27.854
there's a couple odd elements of

1404
00:53:29.518 --> 00:53:33.425
errant organic material

1405
00:53:33.425 --> 00:53:34.889
floating at the edges

1406
00:53:34.889 --> 00:53:37.786
that have congealed on the outside.

1407
00:53:37.786 --> 00:53:39.392
TALIESIN: There's no movement?

1408
00:53:39.392 --> 00:53:43.427
MATT: There's no movement. You do see,

1409
00:53:43.427 --> 00:53:47.078
sunken down about 20 or so feet, probably,

1410
00:53:47.078 --> 00:53:52.078
what was once a, or might've been a bloated giant corpse

1411
00:53:52.406 --> 00:53:55.358
that has drowned and sunk to the bottom.

1412
00:53:55.358 --> 00:53:57.089
SAM: Gross.

1413
00:53:57.089 --> 00:53:59.089
MATT: That's probably where the material is drifting up.

1414
00:53:59.089 --> 00:54:01.337
LAURA: Ew.

1415
00:54:01.337 --> 00:54:03.678
TALIESIN: I would say let's start heading upstairs,

1416
00:54:03.678 --> 00:54:05.950
and I'm going to Sacred Flame the living hell out of

1417
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.635
that thing at the bottom of the water on the way up,

1418
00:54:07.635 --> 00:54:12.267
just to desecrate whatever remains happen to be in that tub.

1419
00:54:12.267 --> 00:54:15.604
LIAM: Any goblins in them?

1420
00:54:15.604 --> 00:54:17.155
MATT: You do attempt Sacred Flame a couple times,

1421
00:54:17.155 --> 00:54:19.387
the nature of this being a tub of water,

1422
00:54:19.387 --> 00:54:21.564
the flames don't really burst.

1423
00:54:21.564 --> 00:54:25.286
It's doing a little bit, but it's (hissing).

1424
00:54:25.286 --> 00:54:27.787
TALIESIN: Can I, if I attempt, no I need to touch,

1425
00:54:27.787 --> 00:54:30.193
I won't be able to do any of my other stuff.

1426
00:54:30.193 --> 00:54:31.587
ASHLEY: How far down is it?

1427
00:54:31.587 --> 00:54:32.426
MATT: About 20 feet.

1428
00:54:32.426 --> 00:54:33.577
TALIESIN: That's far down.

1429
00:54:33.577 --> 00:54:35.385
MATT: That's the top of it, which means its body

1430
00:54:35.385 --> 00:54:37.307
probably goes down another 15 or so feet.

1431
00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:38.737
LAURA: I can try to Toll the Dead at it,

1432
00:54:38.737 --> 00:54:41.075
but I don't think it does anything.

1433
00:54:41.075 --> 00:54:42.689
SAM: It's dead!

1434
00:54:42.689 --> 00:54:44.177
LAURA: It's necrotic damage.

1435
00:54:44.177 --> 00:54:45.217
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that doesn't really.

1436
00:54:45.217 --> 00:54:47.075
Yeah, I don't have any of my purified water

1437
00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:50.086
or anything fun to improve the water right now.

1438
00:54:50.086 --> 00:54:52.550
Eh. Wrong toolkit.

1439
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:55.315
MARISHA: I continue to lead the search party up the stairs.

1440
00:54:55.315 --> 00:54:56.745
TRAVIS: Nothing to check in the room, right,

1441
00:54:56.745 --> 00:54:58.424
no chests, no windows?

1442
00:54:58.424 --> 00:55:01.308
TALIESIN: There's nothing weird. We don't get a sense

1443
00:55:01.308 --> 00:55:02.623
that there's anything weird in the room

1444
00:55:02.623 --> 00:55:03.924
while we're in there?

1445
00:55:03.924 --> 00:55:06.025
MATT: Glancing around, no, it's pretty simple.

1446
00:55:06.025 --> 00:55:09.694
If you wanted to make an investigation check.

1447
00:55:09.694 --> 00:55:11.876
TRAVIS: Just to see if there was any sort of iconography.

1448
00:55:11.876 --> 00:55:14.574
TALIESIN: Since you're the back of the line, anyway.

1449
00:55:14.574 --> 00:55:16.164
TRAVIS: Fuck, that's a one.

1450
00:55:16.164 --> 00:55:17.796
TALIESIN: Oof, rough--

1451
00:55:17.796 --> 00:55:19.475
LAURA: Is that the same one that rolled a one earlier?

1452
00:55:19.475 --> 00:55:22.334
TRAVIS: No, it's a different one.

1453
00:55:22.334 --> 00:55:26.105
MATT: So Fjord does an extensive pass around the room

1454
00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:27.705
and runs his fingers along the wall

1455
00:55:27.705 --> 00:55:28.894
and then turns around and

1456
00:55:28.894 --> 00:55:30.774
it's fine.

1457
00:55:30.774 --> 00:55:31.676
TRAVIS: It's fine.

1458
00:55:31.676 --> 00:55:33.700
LAURA: You know what I could really use right now?

1459
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.533
SAM: What?

1460
00:55:34.533 --> 00:55:35.366
LAURA: A doughnut.

1461
00:55:36.412 --> 00:55:40.596
SAM: I have a really stale, like, scone.

1462
00:55:40.596 --> 00:55:42.806
A really stale scone.

1463
00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:43.904
LAURA: I don't want that.

1464
00:55:43.904 --> 00:55:44.737
SAM: Okay.

1465
00:55:44.737 --> 00:55:46.965
LAURA: I want a doughnut in real life though.

1466
00:55:46.965 --> 00:55:49.326
SAM: Oh, you, Laura Bailey, want a doughnut?

1467
00:55:49.326 --> 00:55:52.166
LAURA: Yeah, I want a doughnut, y'all.

1468
00:55:52.166 --> 00:55:54.025
ASHLEY: Should we order some Krispy Kremes or something?

1469
00:55:54.025 --> 00:55:56.225
TRAVIS: Can that happen?

1470
00:55:56.225 --> 00:55:57.058
MATT: and TALIESIN: Anyway.

1471
00:55:57.058 --> 00:55:58.398
LIAM: I apparate Frumpkin--

1472
00:55:58.398 --> 00:56:02.071
MARISHA: Can you Postmates Krispy Kreme?

1473
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:04.629
LIAM: Tell him to stick by Beau's side

1474
00:56:04.629 --> 00:56:05.462
and I'm going to stop seeing

1475
00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:08.417
and hold onto Fjord's shoulder and follow by touch,

1476
00:56:08.417 --> 00:56:11.609
and Frumpkin is going to sidekick Beauregard.

1477
00:56:11.609 --> 00:56:12.569
MATT: Okay.

1478
00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:16.045
SAM: I mean, I wouldn't say no to a chocolate if--

1479
00:56:16.045 --> 00:56:17.186
ASHLEY: I wouldn't, either.

1480
00:56:17.186 --> 00:56:19.620
MATT: Who's going up the stairs first?

1481
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.655
What's the marching order here?

1482
00:56:21.655 --> 00:56:23.963
TALIESIN: Beau in front.

1483
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:25.277
SAM: Want me to come with and check for stuff?

1484
00:56:25.277 --> 00:56:27.902
ASHLEY: I'll go after Beau.
TALIESIN: I'll go after Yasha.

1485
00:56:27.902 --> 00:56:29.849
MATT: It is a wide staircase, you can go two at a time,

1486
00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:31.747
if you want to.

1487
00:56:31.747 --> 00:56:32.957
ASHLEY: I'll go beside Beau.

1488
00:56:32.957 --> 00:56:34.070
MATT: We have Yasha and Beau up front.

1489
00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:35.350
MARISHA: Sentinel bitches.

1490
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.819
LAURA: I'll go next to Caleb, I mean Caduceus.

1491
00:56:38.819 --> 00:56:40.670
LIAM: Caleb and Fjord should go together.

1492
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.409
LAURA: But I like you.

1493
00:56:42.409 --> 00:56:43.830
TALIESIN: I like you, too.

1494
00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.798
MATT: All right, is it Caleb and Nott next?

1495
00:56:45.798 --> 00:56:47.945
LIAM: Caleb and Fjord, because I'm holding onto--

1496
00:56:47.945 --> 00:56:49.637
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's right.

1497
00:56:49.637 --> 00:56:51.907
MATT: Nott is holding up the rear.

1498
00:56:51.907 --> 00:56:54.749
Then Soorna following from behind.

1499
00:56:54.749 --> 00:56:57.438
LAURA: Okay, Nott can switch with me.

1500
00:56:57.438 --> 00:56:58.957
Nott was supposed to be at the front!

1501
00:56:58.957 --> 00:57:00.285
SAM: I kept getting bumped back.

1502
00:57:00.285 --> 00:57:02.118
TALIESIN: Matt's going to get us Krispy Kreme.

1503
00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:03.097
Everything's going to be okay.

1504
00:57:03.097 --> 00:57:03.930
SAM: Oh, Matt's gone,

1505
00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.906
am I supposed to do an advertisement for something?

1506
00:57:06.906 --> 00:57:08.604
D&amp;D Beyond is the service that we use

1507
00:57:08.604 --> 00:57:11.655
to track our stats, treasure, equipment, gear.

1508
00:57:11.655 --> 00:57:14.906
It's really been phenomenal this whole campaign

1509
00:57:14.906 --> 00:57:18.737
and also, they let me do shit.

1510
00:57:18.737 --> 00:57:20.045
Oh my god.

1511
00:57:20.045 --> 00:57:21.035
MARISHA: Right on top!

1512
00:57:21.035 --> 00:57:24.937
MATT: Heading up, there is another enclosed space

1513
00:57:24.937 --> 00:57:27.766
as you head up the spiral staircase,

1514
00:57:27.766 --> 00:57:30.516
emerging from the top view, here.

1515
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:34.667
LAURA: Matt, I should switch with Nott,

1516
00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:36.926
because Sam kept saying he wanted to be at the front--

1517
00:57:36.926 --> 00:57:37.998
SAM: No, you're fine.

1518
00:57:37.998 --> 00:57:40.114
That was to check for stuff and nobody checked,

1519
00:57:40.114 --> 00:57:40.956
so we're fine.

1520
00:57:40.956 --> 00:57:42.187
MATT: Yeah, nobody's checked.

1521
00:57:42.187 --> 00:57:44.257
And Soorna is in the back,

1522
00:57:44.257 --> 00:57:45.447
we'll say Soorna is over there.

1523
00:57:45.447 --> 00:57:46.579
TALIESIN: I feel like we would've known.

1524
00:57:46.579 --> 00:57:50.475
This is somebody's house; what's the weirdest?

1525
00:57:50.475 --> 00:57:54.385
MATT: You guys step up into this next chamber.

1526
00:57:54.385 --> 00:57:56.426
It's a cold temperature.

1527
00:57:56.426 --> 00:58:01.426
This rounded room stands about 25 feet the top,

1528
00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.759
and it's interesting, the edges,

1529
00:58:03.759 --> 00:58:05.117
there are no corners where it meets ceiling,

1530
00:58:05.117 --> 00:58:07.148
it stands up and then curves.

1531
00:58:07.148 --> 00:58:07.981
It's not domed, but

1532
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:10.250
there are no hard corners to this chamber.

1533
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.352
It's cause most of its been hand carved out

1534
00:58:12.352 --> 00:58:15.442
or shaped from the stone of the interior of the mountain

1535
00:58:15.442 --> 00:58:18.592
that this whole fortress is built into.

1536
00:58:18.592 --> 00:58:21.162
That hard water smell seems to have also drifted up

1537
00:58:21.162 --> 00:58:22.592
and filled into this chamber,

1538
00:58:22.592 --> 00:58:26.690
but there's also hints of burned incense and herbs,

1539
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:29.432
though you don't see anything around but small bits of ash.

1540
00:58:29.432 --> 00:58:31.402
You can see there are elements of

1541
00:58:31.402 --> 00:58:35.730
what might have been rituals or worship in here of some kind

1542
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:39.682
that cling to the edges of the room itself.

1543
00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:42.162
The walls do have a number of simple

1544
00:58:42.162 --> 00:58:44.712
and elegant paintings on them.

1545
00:58:44.712 --> 00:58:45.781
Simple coloration.

1546
00:58:45.781 --> 00:58:49.290
You can see like wind sweeps and mountain ranges

1547
00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.442
and you can see tiers upon tiers of clouds,

1548
00:58:52.442 --> 00:58:57.442
above mountains, above land, below.

1549
00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.781
Elements, it's this simple

1550
00:58:59.781 --> 00:59:04.781
but beautiful interpretation of the world

1551
00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:08.442
or the elements and all the things that make up the world,

1552
00:59:08.442 --> 00:59:12.409
that's the best way you can interpret it at a glance.

1553
00:59:12.409 --> 00:59:15.322
You see winds blowing over mountains and trees,

1554
00:59:15.322 --> 00:59:19.341
seas and stars, that are above. The roof seems to

1555
00:59:19.341 --> 00:59:23.091
have simple constellations placed out.

1556
00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:28.152
You do see in the center, there is a raised platform,

1557
00:59:28.152 --> 00:59:31.001
and a piece of thick leather

1558
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:33.293
that may have been folded or placed up there

1559
00:59:33.293 --> 00:59:36.341
as part of a ceremonial sitting or meditation space,

1560
00:59:36.341 --> 00:59:39.722
but it's been moved and shifted. Across the floor,

1561
00:59:39.722 --> 00:59:43.420
there are masses of blood splattered across

1562
00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.573
that have dried that aren't recent,

1563
00:59:46.573 --> 00:59:50.552
you don't see that slick of recently spilled blood

1564
00:59:50.552 --> 00:59:53.969
that is dull and dried for the most part.

1565
00:59:56.124 --> 00:59:57.441
Yeah.

1566
00:59:57.441 --> 01:00:00.173
SAM: No living creatures in here?

1567
01:00:00.173 --> 01:00:01.882
MATT: Make a perception check.

1568
01:00:01.882 --> 01:00:03.201
SAM: Okay, from the back,

1569
01:00:03.201 --> 01:00:07.061
I'm going to try to look past everybody else. Hey, 18!

1570
01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:09.653
MATT: 18. Are you guys all moving up in the chamber

1571
01:00:09.653 --> 01:00:11.395
or are you staying on the stairs?

1572
01:00:11.395 --> 01:00:12.781
LAURA: I want to stay on the stair.

1573
01:00:12.781 --> 01:00:14.031
MATT: Okay, we'll move you guys up a bit

1574
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:15.180
so at least you all get inside.

1575
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.992
TALIESIN: I want to spread us out a bit, yeah.

1576
01:00:17.992 --> 01:00:19.032
MATT: Jester are you staying on the stair?

1577
01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.024
LAURA: Yeah, I'm staying on the stair.

1578
01:00:21.024 --> 01:00:22.474
LIAM: I'll stay on the stairs,

1579
01:00:22.474 --> 01:00:23.831
but Frumpkin is still by Beauregard.

1580
01:00:23.831 --> 01:00:24.664
MATT: Okay.

1581
01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:27.893
LIAM: Is that some sort of arcane altar in the center?

1582
01:00:27.893 --> 01:00:31.476
MATT: It looks like a raised platform, where

1583
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.471
at first, it looks like what would be a ritual

1584
01:00:35.471 --> 01:00:39.310
or some sort of an event would take place there.

1585
01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:40.732
Soorna steps up--

1586
01:00:40.732 --> 01:00:42.882
TALIESIN: Do the blood splatters

1587
01:00:42.882 --> 01:00:45.773
indicate something ritualistic,

1588
01:00:45.773 --> 01:00:48.301
or more of just something terrible that happened?

1589
01:00:48.301 --> 01:00:49.682
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1590
01:00:49.682 --> 01:00:51.438
TALIESIN: A medicine check?

1591
01:00:51.438 --> 01:00:53.062
MATT: Or religion, your choice.

1592
01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:54.148
TALIESIN: 11.

1593
01:00:54.148 --> 01:00:56.093
MATT: 11, hard to tell.

1594
01:00:56.093 --> 01:01:00.799
They look scattered, but you don't know if it was

1595
01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:04.673
part of a ritual, or--make a religion check as well.

1596
01:01:04.673 --> 01:01:05.764
TALIESIN: A religion check as well?

1597
01:01:05.764 --> 01:01:06.597
MATT: Yeah.

1598
01:01:07.854 --> 01:01:08.687
TALIESIN: 13.

1599
01:01:08.687 --> 01:01:10.542
MATT: 13, yeah, you're not sure.

1600
01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:12.959
TALIESIN: Soorna, what did you do up here

1601
01:01:12.959 --> 01:01:14.184
other than meditate?

1602
01:01:14.184 --> 01:01:15.901
Is this--what is this?

1603
01:01:15.901 --> 01:01:20.233
MATT: "This is where I meditate. This was not here before.

1604
01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:25.233
"This was probably one of our brethren falling."

1605
01:01:26.214 --> 01:01:27.785
TALIESIN: Why up here?

1606
01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:28.854
MARISHA: Where's his body?

1607
01:01:28.854 --> 01:01:30.155
MATT: You rolled a what perception--?

1608
01:01:30.155 --> 01:01:30.988
SAM: 18.

1609
01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:31.854
MATT: 18.

1610
01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.470
You're glancing around the chamber and looking up

1611
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:39.239
and in the apex above where the constellations are,

1612
01:01:39.239 --> 01:01:41.721
you see a small little jagged line

1613
01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:45.141
of faint purple-red energy.

1614
01:01:45.141 --> 01:01:46.718
SAM: It's one of the rifts.

1615
01:01:46.718 --> 01:01:47.970
One of the rifts is up there.

1616
01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:48.938
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

1617
01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:52.021
Wait, do you have to touch--no, you don't have to touch it.

1618
01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:55.718
MATT: Caduceus, you do hear, as you're talking to Soorna,

1619
01:01:55.718 --> 01:01:58.189
what sounds like water moving.

1620
01:01:58.189 --> 01:02:03.189
TALIESIN: I immediately ready a spell.

1621
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.269
We hear water moving?

1622
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:05.102
MATT: You hear water moving.

1623
01:02:05.102 --> 01:02:05.935
TALIESIN: Coming from downstairs?

1624
01:02:05.935 --> 01:02:07.200
MATT: It is.

1625
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.629
TALIESIN: It's coming up the stairs everyone, get ready.

1626
01:02:09.629 --> 01:02:11.269
LAURA: Can I try to cast Dispel Magic on the rift?

1627
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:12.360
MATT: You can.

1628
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.768
Go ahead and roll a d20.

1629
01:02:14.768 --> 01:02:15.608
LAURA: Okay.

1630
01:02:15.608 --> 01:02:16.858
MATT: Add your wisdom modifier.

1631
01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:17.891
TRAVIS: C'mon, Jess!

1632
01:02:17.891 --> 01:02:19.040
Because something is coming through.

1633
01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.873
You can see a shape reaching--

1634
01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:22.500
LAURA: I'm doing it at 4th level.

1635
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.193
MATT: At 4th level, okay.

1636
01:02:24.193 --> 01:02:25.712
LIAM: I'm going to release the drift globe

1637
01:02:25.712 --> 01:02:27.837
and say <i>tawaj</i> and cast Daylight up here.

1638
01:02:28.712 --> 01:02:30.335
To light the entire room.

1639
01:02:30.335 --> 01:02:31.168
MATT: Okay.

1640
01:02:32.088 --> 01:02:34.171
LAURA: My wisdom modifier--13?

1641
01:02:36.275 --> 01:02:37.575
Wait but, "When you cast a spell

1642
01:02:37.575 --> 01:02:38.905
"using a spell slot at 4th-level

1643
01:02:38.905 --> 01:02:40.916
"or higher you automatically end the effects of the spell

1644
01:02:40.916 --> 01:02:42.416
"on the target if the spell is

1645
01:02:42.416 --> 01:02:44.131
equal to or less than a level,"

1646
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:45.081
MATT: Correct.

1647
01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:46.493
It's not a spell level, but there is a DC on it.

1648
01:02:46.493 --> 01:02:47.415
So 13?

1649
01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:48.248
LAURA: Yeah.

1650
01:02:48.248 --> 01:02:49.505
MATT: Does not succeed unfortunately.

1651
01:02:49.505 --> 01:02:50.338
LAURA: Fuck.

1652
01:02:50.338 --> 01:02:53.244
MATT: You reach up and attempt to release your divine energy

1653
01:02:53.244 --> 01:02:57.282
to entrap and banish this tear between the realms

1654
01:02:57.282 --> 01:02:59.505
and it flickers for a second before you see something

1655
01:02:59.505 --> 01:03:03.264
(explosion) and emerge from it.

1656
01:03:03.264 --> 01:03:04.585
MARISHA: I have a feeling it's--

1657
01:03:04.585 --> 01:03:05.825
Yeah.

1658
01:03:05.825 --> 01:03:08.914
(screaming)

1659
01:03:08.914 --> 01:03:13.914
TRAVIS: (screaming)

1660
01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:15.156
LAURA: No!

1661
01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:16.310
Go away I don't like you!

1662
01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:18.560
MATT: Everyone roll initiative.

1663
01:03:20.143 --> 01:03:21.767
LAURA: Dammit, why couldn't I have rolled better?

1664
01:03:21.767 --> 01:03:22.687
MARISHA: Dammit!

1665
01:03:22.687 --> 01:03:23.520
ASHLEY: Ooh!

1666
01:03:24.395 --> 01:03:25.796
TRAVIS: Wow.

1667
01:03:25.796 --> 01:03:27.207
MARISHA: Why are all of our roles real shit?

1668
01:03:27.207 --> 01:03:28.286
TRAVIS: Wow.

1669
01:03:28.286 --> 01:03:29.225
MATT: How you doing buddy?

1670
01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:31.116
TRAVIS: Second natural one I've rolled.

1671
01:03:31.116 --> 01:03:32.199
MATT: Dude, dude!

1672
01:03:33.884 --> 01:03:35.134
Come on, Fjord.

1673
01:03:35.975 --> 01:03:39.225
TRAVIS: (aggravated breathing)

1674
01:03:41.164 --> 01:03:43.073
TRAVIS: Something roll higher than a five.

1675
01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:46.073
There you go, okay, you get to play.

1676
01:03:49.665 --> 01:03:51.625
MATT: All righty, so, 25 to 20 anybody?

1677
01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:52.458
LAURA: 20.

1678
01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:53.291
ASHLEY: 20!

1679
01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:54.524
SAM: 25.

1680
01:03:54.524 --> 01:03:55.604
MATT: Damn!

1681
01:03:55.604 --> 01:03:56.615
SAM: Natural 20.

1682
01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:57.455
LAURA: Nice!

1683
01:03:57.455 --> 01:03:58.788
MATT: All right, Nott.

1684
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:00.953
Nott, 25.

1685
01:04:00.953 --> 01:04:02.850
Jester and Yasha, 20?

1686
01:04:08.556 --> 01:04:10.694
20 to 15.

1687
01:04:10.694 --> 01:04:11.527
TALIESIN: 18.

1688
01:04:13.687 --> 01:04:14.520
MATT: All right.

1689
01:04:21.355 --> 01:04:22.945
All righty.

1690
01:04:22.945 --> 01:04:24.725
That brings us to 15 to 10.

1691
01:04:24.725 --> 01:04:25.895
LIAM: 13.

1692
01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:26.728
MARISHA: 10.

1693
01:04:28.783 --> 01:04:29.616
MATT: Oh.

1694
01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.033
Ten to five?

1695
01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.116
Fjord, what'd you get?

1696
01:04:34.116 --> 01:04:37.196
TRAVIS: Natural one, with an initiative bonus of zero!

1697
01:04:37.196 --> 01:04:39.740
MATT: Yeah, one, all right, there we go.

1698
01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:44.740
Well, as this chasme (buzzing)

1699
01:04:44.945 --> 01:04:47.705
emerges from the chamber--

1700
01:04:47.705 --> 01:04:49.373
and I believe people who have made saves,

1701
01:04:49.373 --> 01:04:51.975
Jester and Fjord have already been affected by it--

1702
01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.695
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, so I got like an immunity to it?

1703
01:04:54.695 --> 01:04:56.763
MATT: I'll tell you what happens here in a second,

1704
01:04:56.763 --> 01:04:59.615
but you have to tell me if it affected you before or not.

1705
01:04:59.615 --> 01:05:01.511
You made your save last time.

1706
01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:03.527
LIAM: I believe I made my save, too.

1707
01:05:03.527 --> 01:05:06.004
ASHLEY: I feel like I made a save.

1708
01:05:06.004 --> 01:05:07.337
MATT: You made a save.

1709
01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:08.632
Nott, were you--?

1710
01:05:08.632 --> 01:05:11.204
SAM: I made a save, I believe I made a save,

1711
01:05:11.204 --> 01:05:12.713
I didn't fall asleep, so yeah.

1712
01:05:12.713 --> 01:05:13.924
MATT: Right, so everybody's made a save?

1713
01:05:13.924 --> 01:05:15.375
MARISHA: We had wisdom bonuses right?

1714
01:05:15.375 --> 01:05:16.935
Didn't we do a feast?

1715
01:05:16.935 --> 01:05:18.844
TALIESIN: Yeah, because there was a feast or a--

1716
01:05:19.827 --> 01:05:21.577
No, it was a Bless.

1717
01:05:22.595 --> 01:05:24.214
MATT: Good to know,

1718
01:05:24.214 --> 01:05:26.145
everyone here has been effected by it or made a save.

1719
01:05:26.145 --> 01:05:26.978
Good to know.

1720
01:05:26.978 --> 01:05:29.318
Okay, so, Nott, your turn.

1721
01:05:29.318 --> 01:05:30.895
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

1722
01:05:30.895 --> 01:05:33.668
MATT: You see it emerge, its long dripping, you know,

1723
01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:35.751
pointed, saber-like face.

1724
01:05:36.935 --> 01:05:39.425
Its wings buzzing, the droning filling the chamber

1725
01:05:39.425 --> 01:05:42.632
with this angry, aggressive, fiendish drone.

1726
01:05:43.524 --> 01:05:47.214
Technically it is actually about ten feet here

1727
01:05:47.214 --> 01:05:49.005
since it emerged from the top.

1728
01:05:49.005 --> 01:05:51.363
LAURA: I'm almost out of spells.

1729
01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:52.745
MATT: You hear something from downstairs,

1730
01:05:52.745 --> 01:05:55.375
a bunch of water is displaced and spilling

1731
01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:58.824
and you hear these wet steps

1732
01:05:58.824 --> 01:06:00.527
coming up the stairs below you.

1733
01:06:00.527 --> 01:06:03.102
SAM: Five, ten, 15, 20. Can I move

1734
01:06:03.102 --> 01:06:05.252
all the way to this pillar?

1735
01:06:05.252 --> 01:06:06.085
MATT: Yeah.

1736
01:06:06.085 --> 01:06:09.436
SAM: Or is there anywhere near me that I can hide?

1737
01:06:09.436 --> 01:06:11.076
MATT: You can probably move behind this pillar.

1738
01:06:11.076 --> 01:06:12.396
SAM: Okay.

1739
01:06:12.396 --> 01:06:13.767
I know it's going to watch me do that,

1740
01:06:13.767 --> 01:06:15.575
but then can I bonus action hide?

1741
01:06:15.575 --> 01:06:17.242
MATT: Sure, you can try.

1742
01:06:18.255 --> 01:06:20.695
Getting over the pillar, too, the pillar itself is cracked.

1743
01:06:20.695 --> 01:06:23.025
It looks like whatever scattered the blood here,

1744
01:06:23.025 --> 01:06:25.767
this pillar seemed to take a little bit of damage

1745
01:06:25.767 --> 01:06:28.105
and so you come up to it and it's cracked.

1746
01:06:28.105 --> 01:06:29.855
You're having to find a space to try

1747
01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:31.344
and hide your body, but you're a goblin,

1748
01:06:31.344 --> 01:06:32.724
so you're nice and small.

1749
01:06:32.724 --> 01:06:36.855
SAM: Okay, so maybe I'll go behind the pillar on one side

1750
01:06:36.855 --> 01:06:38.735
and peek around the other and fire

1751
01:06:38.735 --> 01:06:40.252
and see if that's enough to hide.

1752
01:06:40.252 --> 01:06:41.225
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

1753
01:06:41.225 --> 01:06:42.756
SAM: Okay.

1754
01:06:42.756 --> 01:06:45.333
Natural 20, that's two natural 20's in a row.

1755
01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:47.236
MATT: I'll allow that to be hidden.

1756
01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.225
(laughter)

1757
01:06:49.225 --> 01:06:51.095
I was like, this is going to be a high DC, but that's--

1758
01:06:51.095 --> 01:06:52.804
SAM: Yeah, I threw some pebbles the other way

1759
01:06:52.804 --> 01:06:54.215
to draw its attention.

1760
01:06:54.215 --> 01:06:55.127
MATT: It was more focused on the cleric

1761
01:06:55.127 --> 01:06:58.015
that was trying to seal its entry doorway.

1762
01:06:58.015 --> 01:06:58.945
SAM: Sure.

1763
01:06:58.945 --> 01:07:02.185
I'll pop around the other side and take a shot.

1764
01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:04.760
Terrible, terrible.

1765
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.836
14.

1766
01:07:05.836 --> 01:07:06.870
MATT: 14 misses.

1767
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.286
SAM: Damn! All that effort.

1768
01:07:08.286 --> 01:07:09.453
MATT: You roll with advantage though,

1769
01:07:09.453 --> 01:07:10.474
because you're not seen.

1770
01:07:10.474 --> 01:07:12.085
SAM: Oh!

1771
01:07:12.085 --> 01:07:13.497
That's a 19, plus 10.

1772
01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:14.345
MATT: See, that hits.

1773
01:07:14.345 --> 01:07:15.178
SAM: Oh, okay.

1774
01:07:15.178 --> 01:07:16.316
MATT: Yeah if it doesn't see you,

1775
01:07:16.316 --> 01:07:17.305
if you're stealthed or hidden--

1776
01:07:17.305 --> 01:07:18.138
SAM: I get advantage.

1777
01:07:18.138 --> 01:07:19.825
MATT: That's how you give yourself your sneak attack.

1778
01:07:19.825 --> 01:07:20.876
SAM: I'm terrible at rogue-ing.

1779
01:07:20.876 --> 01:07:22.049
MATT: You'll figure out how to play your character

1780
01:07:22.049 --> 01:07:23.192
eventually in this campaign.

1781
01:07:23.192 --> 01:07:24.879
(laughter)

1782
01:07:24.879 --> 01:07:26.769
SAM: Can Liam just play it for me?

1783
01:07:26.769 --> 01:07:28.385
LIAM: I don't get the rules right either.

1784
01:07:28.385 --> 01:07:30.156
I mean, I always get the rules right,

1785
01:07:30.156 --> 01:07:32.887
because I'm Liam O'Brien, vote Liam O'Brien.

1786
01:07:32.887 --> 01:07:34.343
Vote With Your Johnson.

1787
01:07:34.343 --> 01:07:36.065
(laughter)

1788
01:07:36.065 --> 01:07:36.898
SAM: Okay.

1789
01:07:37.905 --> 01:07:39.297
ASHLEY: Once per day.

1790
01:07:43.228 --> 01:07:46.687
SAM: Okay, 23 points.

1791
01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:48.407
MATT: 23 points of damage, nice.

1792
01:07:48.407 --> 01:07:51.055
LAURA: That's the only option I have.

1793
01:07:51.055 --> 01:07:52.295
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

1794
01:07:52.295 --> 01:07:53.128
SAM: That's my turn.

1795
01:07:53.128 --> 01:07:54.905
MATT: End of your go.

1796
01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:58.855
Next up in the order is Yasha and Jester.

1797
01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.335
LAURA: Take it down.

1798
01:08:02.335 --> 01:08:03.215
ASHLEY: Okay.

1799
01:08:03.215 --> 01:08:05.623
LAURA: I'm going to try to shoot my 5th-level spell,

1800
01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:06.915
that's all I have left,

1801
01:08:06.915 --> 01:08:08.668
to try to dispel that fucking rift again,

1802
01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.015
just in case anything else comes out.

1803
01:08:10.015 --> 01:08:11.596
MATT: Okay, roll another d20.

1804
01:08:11.596 --> 01:08:13.631
ASHLEY: Come on, baby.

1805
01:08:16.623 --> 01:08:17.948
LAURA: Natural one.

1806
01:08:17.948 --> 01:08:18.854
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1807
01:08:18.854 --> 01:08:21.653
(sighing)

1808
01:08:21.653 --> 01:08:23.266
LAURA: That rift is staying open, because that's all I got.

1809
01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:24.635
MATT: It is.

1810
01:08:24.635 --> 01:08:25.957
SAM: For now.

1811
01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:27.296
We got this.

1812
01:08:27.296 --> 01:08:30.437
MATT: As you're trying to focus, your nerves are kicking in

1813
01:08:30.437 --> 01:08:34.886
and you're so driven on this, but whatever fiendish force

1814
01:08:34.886 --> 01:08:38.066
is holding this open is a bit stronger

1815
01:08:38.066 --> 01:08:41.656
and a bit more bent on maintaining its connection

1816
01:08:41.656 --> 01:08:43.266
to the Prime Material Plane.

1817
01:08:43.266 --> 01:08:44.677
LAURA: Fuck!

1818
01:08:44.677 --> 01:08:48.177
SAM: Caduceus, tell the giant about the rift!

1819
01:08:49.397 --> 01:08:51.789
TALIESIN: I'm definitely going to point out

1820
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:54.107
when my turn comes.

1821
01:08:54.107 --> 01:08:56.528
MATT: The giant can see it.

1822
01:08:56.528 --> 01:08:57.877
It's about head level with the giant

1823
01:08:57.877 --> 01:08:59.776
and as it steps up and looks, there's a flash

1824
01:08:59.776 --> 01:09:02.493
as the demon creature comes out and the droning begins

1825
01:09:02.493 --> 01:09:05.661
and the giant begins to hold its ears.

1826
01:09:05.661 --> 01:09:07.375
Anyway, Yasha, your turn.

1827
01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:08.368
ASHLEY: Yep.

1828
01:09:08.368 --> 01:09:10.237
MATT: You have movement and bonus still.

1829
01:09:10.237 --> 01:09:15.237
ASHLEY: I am going to make my way towards

1830
01:09:15.665 --> 01:09:17.143
Gary Busey Two.

1831
01:09:17.143 --> 01:09:18.664
(laughter)

1832
01:09:18.664 --> 01:09:22.464
ALL: (singing) I am Gary Busey!

1833
01:09:22.464 --> 01:09:23.875
MATT: It is out of your melee range,

1834
01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:26.075
it is flying ten feet up in the air,

1835
01:09:26.075 --> 01:09:27.944
so you're not able to quite strike it.

1836
01:09:27.944 --> 01:09:30.769
If you want to try and leap and make one attack,

1837
01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:31.936
I'll allow it.

1838
01:09:34.583 --> 01:09:36.249
ASHLEY: Yeah, why not.

1839
01:09:36.249 --> 01:09:37.082
MATT: Okay.

1840
01:09:37.082 --> 01:09:38.190
ASHLEY: Why not.

1841
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.888
MATT: Are you raging, or--?

1842
01:09:41.888 --> 01:09:43.420
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm raging, I'm raging, I'm raging.

1843
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.318
(laughter)

1844
01:09:44.318 --> 01:09:45.358
MATT: I figured you were.

1845
01:09:45.358 --> 01:09:46.718
ASHLEY: Yeah yeah yeah, of course, of course I'm raging,

1846
01:09:46.718 --> 01:09:47.635
I'm so mad.

1847
01:09:49.537 --> 01:09:52.868
MATT: You run, leap, and you get one attack this turn

1848
01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:53.701
because you're going to have to

1849
01:09:53.701 --> 01:09:54.534
try and get up into the area,

1850
01:09:54.534 --> 01:09:57.660
but you have advantage on your athletics checks.

1851
01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.219
Roll an athletics check with advantage.

1852
01:09:59.219 --> 01:10:01.657
ASHLEY: Okay, oh that would be athletics?

1853
01:10:01.657 --> 01:10:02.850
Because I rolled a--

1854
01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:03.683
MATT: Yes.

1855
01:10:05.174 --> 01:10:06.483
ASHLEY: 15.

1856
01:10:06.483 --> 01:10:08.545
MATT: 15, is that with advantage?

1857
01:10:08.545 --> 01:10:09.425
ASHLEY: Nope.

1858
01:10:09.425 --> 01:10:10.762
MATT: You have advantage on it if you are--

1859
01:10:10.762 --> 01:10:11.595
ASHLEY: 15.

1860
01:10:11.595 --> 01:10:12.633
MATT: Okay, 15, yeah.

1861
01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:14.433
You manage to arc up just enough,

1862
01:10:14.433 --> 01:10:16.516
now roll for your attack.

1863
01:10:17.774 --> 01:10:18.963
ASHLEY: Okay.

1864
01:10:18.963 --> 01:10:20.203
(dice clacking)

1865
01:10:20.203 --> 01:10:21.287
MATT: Roll to hit first, though.

1866
01:10:21.287 --> 01:10:22.754
That was just to see if you could leap.

1867
01:10:22.754 --> 01:10:23.587
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry!

1868
01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:25.140
MATT: It's okay, it's a little complicated, it's okay.

1869
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:25.973
ASHLEY: Oh!

1870
01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:28.140
Okay, that will hit.

1871
01:10:30.462 --> 01:10:31.434
22.

1872
01:10:31.434 --> 01:10:32.984
MATT: 22, that hits.

1873
01:10:32.984 --> 01:10:34.291
TALIESIN: It's hard to concentrate.

1874
01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:35.374
ASHLEY: So that is--

1875
01:10:36.674 --> 01:10:38.341
TALIESIN: Feel the pressure.

1876
01:10:45.473 --> 01:10:49.946
ASHLEY: 12 points of damage.

1877
01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:51.054
(blade whooshing through air)

1878
01:10:51.054 --> 01:10:53.571
MATT: You arc upward, the very tip of Magician's Judge

1879
01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:56.423
carves past the hanging abdomen

1880
01:10:56.423 --> 01:10:58.752
of this chasme demon creature.

1881
01:10:58.752 --> 01:11:00.082
ASHLEY: Do I get a divine fury?

1882
01:11:00.082 --> 01:11:01.131
MATT: Yeah, you do.

1883
01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:03.064
First attack every turn that hits you get to roll

1884
01:11:03.064 --> 01:11:04.205
the extra damage.

1885
01:11:04.205 --> 01:11:05.513
ASHLEY: Yes, okay, so that is an extra

1886
01:11:05.513 --> 01:11:06.642
nine points of damage.

1887
01:11:06.642 --> 01:11:08.552
MATT: Okay, 21, that's much better.

1888
01:11:08.552 --> 01:11:09.385
(blade whooshing through the air)

1889
01:11:09.385 --> 01:11:11.381
You arc and land, blade down in the side,

1890
01:11:11.381 --> 01:11:12.979
that's going to be the end of your turn though.

1891
01:11:12.979 --> 01:11:14.128
ASHLEY: Great, that's fine.

1892
01:11:14.128 --> 01:11:16.511
MATT: Jester, any movement or bonus action?

1893
01:11:18.561 --> 01:11:20.722
LAURA: I'm going to turn around and look down the stairs

1894
01:11:20.722 --> 01:11:23.301
and I'm assuming I'll see this other giant coming.

1895
01:11:23.301 --> 01:11:26.185
MATT: You don't see it yet, but you can hear the wet--

1896
01:11:26.185 --> 01:11:27.535
TALIESIN: And I made some noise.

1897
01:11:27.535 --> 01:11:29.111
I said somebody is coming from downstairs.

1898
01:11:29.111 --> 01:11:30.191
TRAVIS: Is it out of the pool

1899
01:11:30.191 --> 01:11:31.352
or is it still in the pool, climbing out?

1900
01:11:31.352 --> 01:11:33.690
MATT: You don't know, you don't see, you're upstairs.

1901
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.690
LAURA: Oh no, oh no!

1902
01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:39.210
I'm going to step up off the stairway then,

1903
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:43.631
and move over next to the big giant, up here.

1904
01:11:43.631 --> 01:11:44.464
MATT: There?

1905
01:11:44.464 --> 01:11:45.297
LAURA: Yeah.

1906
01:11:45.297 --> 01:11:46.130
MATT: You got it.

1907
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:47.280
That's your turn Jester?

1908
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.113
LAURA: Yeah.

1909
01:11:48.113 --> 01:11:50.322
MATT: Finishing Jester's turn and Yasha's turn.

1910
01:11:50.322 --> 01:11:51.155
All right.

1911
01:11:53.281 --> 01:11:55.948
(wet footsteps)

1912
01:11:56.894 --> 01:11:59.790
MATT: 35, 40, it gets right up to Caleb

1913
01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:01.331
in the staircase right there.

1914
01:12:01.331 --> 01:12:03.281
SAM: Oh, boy. This is pretty cramped up here.

1915
01:12:03.281 --> 01:12:05.032
(laughter)

1916
01:12:05.032 --> 01:12:07.491
MATT: As you're seeing this happen up there

1917
01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:09.013
and you're readying yourself, you hear the heavy thuds,

1918
01:12:09.013 --> 01:12:10.966
and as Jester darts out of the way,

1919
01:12:10.966 --> 01:12:15.253
you look down and see this bloated, soaking,

1920
01:12:15.253 --> 01:12:18.893
just water-logged corpse of a stone giant.

1921
01:12:18.893 --> 01:12:21.590
Its flesh dripping off its shoulders from where it's

1922
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:24.744
just decomposed and begun to slough off of it

1923
01:12:24.744 --> 01:12:26.931
from the time it spent underwater.

1924
01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:29.792
And its jaw, once again, tears in the sides,

1925
01:12:29.792 --> 01:12:31.453
and that terrible grin arcs up

1926
01:12:31.453 --> 01:12:33.864
to the sides of its skull as it rushes towards you.

1927
01:12:33.864 --> 01:12:35.773
And it's going to slam you twice, Caleb.

1928
01:12:35.773 --> 01:12:36.606
LIAM: Okay.

1929
01:12:37.784 --> 01:12:39.293
MATT: That's going to be 19 to hit?

1930
01:12:39.293 --> 01:12:40.372
LIAM: Shield, doesn't hit.

1931
01:12:40.372 --> 01:12:41.424
(thudding)

1932
01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:42.984
MATT: As a reaction, (thudding)

1933
01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:45.224
you watch as it deflects this flash of arcane energy

1934
01:12:45.224 --> 01:12:48.992
and its big piece of stone tool

1935
01:12:48.992 --> 01:12:51.321
that it was using to slam just arcs off of it.

1936
01:12:51.321 --> 01:12:52.682
It's going to back hand to try

1937
01:12:52.682 --> 01:12:53.973
and strike you again in the middle of this way.

1938
01:12:53.973 --> 01:12:55.540
LIAM: Oh, Shield's still up.

1939
01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.541
MATT: Shield's still up, yeah.

1940
01:12:56.541 --> 01:12:57.390
22.

1941
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.570
LIAM: That does hit.

1942
01:12:58.570 --> 01:12:59.981
MATT: That does hit, okay.

1943
01:12:59.981 --> 01:13:01.101
The first one you do deflect,

1944
01:13:01.101 --> 01:13:02.899
the second one it comes back angrily,

1945
01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:04.361
its eyes are wild and white,

1946
01:13:04.361 --> 01:13:07.311
you see the the irises have gone clouded over,

1947
01:13:07.311 --> 01:13:09.727
snow-blind looking. And it's not quite looking at you,

1948
01:13:09.727 --> 01:13:11.659
it's looking in your general vicinity,

1949
01:13:11.659 --> 01:13:13.207
the eyes pointing in different directions

1950
01:13:13.207 --> 01:13:16.432
as it arcs back (thudding) and strikes you a second time,

1951
01:13:16.432 --> 01:13:18.574
this time actually making its way through,

1952
01:13:18.574 --> 01:13:20.482
(sing-song) and you suffer--

1953
01:13:21.436 --> 01:13:22.269
LIAM: Sing it.

1954
01:13:24.386 --> 01:13:28.298
SAM: Matt, do you think its eyes sort of looked like this?

1955
01:13:29.781 --> 01:13:31.453
(laughter)

1956
01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:32.552
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage.

1957
01:13:32.552 --> 01:13:33.602
(laughter)

1958
01:13:33.602 --> 01:13:34.792
LIAM: Goddamn you, Sam.

1959
01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:37.576
LAURA: Did you order donuts, behbeh?

1960
01:13:37.576 --> 01:13:39.741
TRAVIS: What kind of a husband do you think I am?

1961
01:13:39.741 --> 01:13:41.241
I ordered like 60.

1962
01:13:43.481 --> 01:13:46.632
One for every dice in that fucking bag.

1963
01:13:46.632 --> 01:13:48.151
MATT: All right.

1964
01:13:48.151 --> 01:13:49.599
LAURA: You think there's only 60 dice?

1965
01:13:49.599 --> 01:13:51.740
TRAVIS: I know, as soon as I said it.

1966
01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:57.640
MATT: It does the two strikes and after it finishes,

1967
01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.990
you watch as the center of its chest (wet cracking)

1968
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:04.192
cracks open, the ribs, snap open

1969
01:14:04.192 --> 01:14:07.061
and its organs start pouring out of its chest,

1970
01:14:07.061 --> 01:14:09.682
splattering into the stone stairs in front of you,

1971
01:14:09.682 --> 01:14:12.952
bursting and you watch as drowned maggots and elements of--

1972
01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:13.941
LAURA: Ugh!

1973
01:14:13.941 --> 01:14:15.893
MATT: Just hitting all over.

1974
01:14:15.893 --> 01:14:17.143
It's revolting.

1975
01:14:18.093 --> 01:14:23.093
I need Fjord, Beau, Caleb, Caduceus, and Jester

1976
01:14:23.112 --> 01:14:25.197
to all make wisdom saving throws, please.

1977
01:14:25.197 --> 01:14:26.127
MARISHA: Oh, god.

1978
01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:27.452
LAURA: Oh, lord.

1979
01:14:27.452 --> 01:14:29.852
TRAVIS: All right, new dice.
All right, new dice.

1980
01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:32.200
Fuck!

1981
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.690
TALIESIN: Motherfucker!

1982
01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:34.707
MARISHA: God dammit!

1983
01:14:34.707 --> 01:14:37.454
SAM: Oh boy guys, there's a lot of cursing going on.

1984
01:14:37.454 --> 01:14:40.107
(laughter)

1985
01:14:40.107 --> 01:14:42.907
MATT: Okay, so, Fjord?

1986
01:14:42.907 --> 01:14:44.347
TRAVIS: Six.

1987
01:14:44.347 --> 01:14:46.560
MATT: All right, you are frightened of it.

1988
01:14:47.627 --> 01:14:48.957
TRAVIS: That's fair.

1989
01:14:48.957 --> 01:14:50.158
MARISHA: Six.

1990
01:14:50.158 --> 01:14:51.448
MATT: Beau is frightened.

1991
01:14:51.448 --> 01:14:53.818
TRAVIS: Please let there be one more, tell me--

1992
01:14:53.818 --> 01:14:54.651
LIAM: 27.

1993
01:14:54.651 --> 01:14:55.917
MATT: You've managed to somehow--

1994
01:14:55.917 --> 01:14:57.775
it got you more than anybody, but you've

1995
01:14:57.775 --> 01:14:59.741
also seen some horrible shit in your life.

1996
01:14:59.741 --> 01:15:00.966
You're like, "Eh, that's fine."

1997
01:15:00.966 --> 01:15:02.049
TALIESIN: 13.

1998
01:15:02.049 --> 01:15:02.998
MATT: You save.

1999
01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:03.831
LAURA: 14.

2000
01:15:03.831 --> 01:15:04.759
MATT: You save.

2001
01:15:04.759 --> 01:15:05.817
TALIESIN: Holy weapon is concentration,

2002
01:15:05.817 --> 01:15:06.733
I didn't take any damage.

2003
01:15:06.733 --> 01:15:07.566
MATT: Correct.

2004
01:15:07.566 --> 01:15:09.247
TRAVIS: Frightened it means you can't approach it, right?

2005
01:15:09.247 --> 01:15:11.047
MATT: It means your attacks have disadvantage.

2006
01:15:11.047 --> 01:15:11.880
TRAVIS: Against it?

2007
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.286
MATT: Against anything as long as you can see it.

2008
01:15:13.286 --> 01:15:15.135
TRAVIS: Any other enemy in the room too?

2009
01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:16.655
MATT: Yeah, as long as you can see it.

2010
01:15:16.655 --> 01:15:20.513
And, you cannot move closer to it intentionally.

2011
01:15:20.513 --> 01:15:21.396
MARISHA: Fuck.

2012
01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:22.578
TALIESIN: Only 'till you save against frightened.

2013
01:15:22.578 --> 01:15:25.784
MATT: That finishes its turn. Caduceus, you're up.

2014
01:15:25.784 --> 01:15:30.138
TALIESIN: I'm going to--because I need my reactions,

2015
01:15:30.138 --> 01:15:32.236
I'm going to cast Channel Divinity on it.

2016
01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.676
The next thing that hits it

2017
01:15:33.676 --> 01:15:36.007
gets double damage. I don't care what it is.

2018
01:15:36.007 --> 01:15:36.840
MATT: You got it.

2019
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.777
TALIESIN: I'm also going to use my bonus to pull out--

2020
01:15:39.777 --> 01:15:43.996
actually before I do that, I'm going to use my bonus--

2021
01:15:43.996 --> 01:15:45.705
fuck it, I'll do it at the time--

2022
01:15:45.705 --> 01:15:48.375
I'm going to put my swarm on

2023
01:15:48.375 --> 01:15:49.975
that little son of a bitch up there.

2024
01:15:49.975 --> 01:15:50.983
MATT: Which one, up here?

2025
01:15:50.983 --> 01:15:51.883
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2026
01:15:51.883 --> 01:15:53.164
SAM: Who did you Channel Divinity on?

2027
01:15:53.164 --> 01:15:54.213
TALIESIN: On the big giant.

2028
01:15:54.213 --> 01:15:55.162
SAM: The big giant.

2029
01:15:55.162 --> 01:15:58.163
MATT: You Channel Divinity, what's it called?

2030
01:15:58.163 --> 01:16:00.352
TALIESIN: It's called Path of the Grave.

2031
01:16:00.352 --> 01:16:03.211
MATT: Path of the Grave towards the giant,

2032
01:16:03.211 --> 01:16:06.603
and then with your other arm, holding out your staff,

2033
01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:11.268
your swarm of buzzing beetles (buzzing)

2034
01:16:11.268 --> 01:16:14.264
gravitating towards the chasme up in the ceiling.

2035
01:16:14.264 --> 01:16:17.133
You watch as this cloud of black clicking, buzzing,

2036
01:16:17.133 --> 01:16:19.524
flying insects begins to match the buzzing

2037
01:16:19.524 --> 01:16:21.713
of the large demon and begins to swarm and surround it.

2038
01:16:21.713 --> 01:16:24.295
You roll for attack for the beetles.

2039
01:16:24.295 --> 01:16:27.405
TALIESIN: That attack is so awful.

2040
01:16:27.405 --> 01:16:28.930
Let's see what happens.

2041
01:16:30.923 --> 01:16:32.464
Eight to hit?

2042
01:16:32.464 --> 01:16:34.152
MATT: Eight to hit, unfortunately does not.

2043
01:16:34.152 --> 01:16:36.824
It's swarming around it.

2044
01:16:36.824 --> 01:16:39.412
You do start getting the sense that that droning

2045
01:16:39.412 --> 01:16:42.024
that was effecting you earlier,

2046
01:16:42.024 --> 01:16:43.491
you've gotten used to it,

2047
01:16:43.491 --> 01:16:44.883
and for the time being,

2048
01:16:44.883 --> 01:16:47.453
it's not beginning to penetrate your mind

2049
01:16:47.453 --> 01:16:49.577
and put you into that lulling sense of sleep

2050
01:16:49.577 --> 01:16:52.253
that maybe effected you earlier.

2051
01:16:52.253 --> 01:16:55.992
TALIESIN: Now I'm going to back into that corner over there.

2052
01:16:55.992 --> 01:16:56.825
MATT: Over there?

2053
01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:57.658
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2054
01:16:57.658 --> 01:17:01.184
I'm going to try and use the--yeah. I'm going to try

2055
01:17:01.184 --> 01:17:02.317
and get a little bit of cover

2056
01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:04.293
and so I can keep an eye on everything that's happening,

2057
01:17:04.293 --> 01:17:06.232
so that I can help with things.

2058
01:17:06.232 --> 01:17:08.773
Yeah, that's an action and a bonus action.

2059
01:17:08.773 --> 01:17:10.344
TALIESIN: Okay, that finishes your go, Caduceus.

2060
01:17:10.344 --> 01:17:12.363
(laughter)

2061
01:17:12.363 --> 01:17:14.664
LAURA: So angry right now.

2062
01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:16.843
TRAVIS: She did the "bwah!"

2063
01:17:16.843 --> 01:17:18.382
(laughter)

2064
01:17:18.382 --> 01:17:19.215
MATT: All right.

2065
01:17:19.215 --> 01:17:20.493
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

2066
01:17:20.493 --> 01:17:21.472
When words fail.

2067
01:17:21.472 --> 01:17:22.403
TALIESIN: I know.

2068
01:17:22.403 --> 01:17:24.984
MATT: The chasme, it's taking its turn,

2069
01:17:24.984 --> 01:17:27.224
it's being swarmed by the insects.

2070
01:17:27.224 --> 01:17:28.843
You've swung and carved it from below,

2071
01:17:28.843 --> 01:17:30.773
it's like (buzzing), it looks down at you

2072
01:17:30.773 --> 01:17:32.830
and you see these horrible, bulbous,

2073
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:34.403
orange-ish yellow eyes,

2074
01:17:34.403 --> 01:17:35.904
that have these glittering--

2075
01:17:35.904 --> 01:17:37.377
what light there is in the daylight

2076
01:17:37.377 --> 01:17:39.731
that's blasting in the chamber is glittering across them,

2077
01:17:39.731 --> 01:17:40.851
and give it this weird almost like,

2078
01:17:40.851 --> 01:17:43.039
internal fire look to it.

2079
01:17:43.039 --> 01:17:44.571
It looks down at you, this greasy,

2080
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:46.440
matting hair almost coming over in the face,

2081
01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.352
its long proboscis, coming to this sharp point,

2082
01:17:49.352 --> 01:17:51.520
drips a little bit of fluid

2083
01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.752
and it (sharp exhale) lunges towards you

2084
01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:54.811
to attempt to strike.

2085
01:17:54.811 --> 01:17:56.211
LAURA: (sighing)

2086
01:17:56.211 --> 01:17:57.291
ASHLEY: Kick its ass, Yasha!

2087
01:17:57.291 --> 01:17:59.374
MATT: Oh, that is going to be...

2088
01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:02.368
23 to hit. Natural 18.

2089
01:18:02.368 --> 01:18:03.326
ASHLEY: Yes, that hits.

2090
01:18:03.326 --> 01:18:04.159
MATT: All right.

2091
01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:04.992
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

2092
01:18:04.992 --> 01:18:06.734
MATT: You do take--

2093
01:18:06.734 --> 01:18:09.191
LAURA: By just a little bit, though.

2094
01:18:09.191 --> 01:18:10.024
MATT: Okay.

2095
01:18:15.222 --> 01:18:17.214
MATT: 17 points of piercing damage, reduced by half,

2096
01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:18.083
because you're raging.

2097
01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:19.017
MATT: Okay.

2098
01:18:19.017 --> 01:18:20.008
SAM: Nice. Tight.

2099
01:18:20.008 --> 01:18:20.900
MATT: You take eight points of piercing damage.

2100
01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:21.791
ASHLEY: Kay, kay.

2101
01:18:21.791 --> 01:18:22.879
Kay kay kay kay.

2102
01:18:22.879 --> 01:18:23.712
MATT: However, you do take--

2103
01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.140
(dice rolling)

2104
01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.381
(sharp inhale)

2105
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:37.847
ASHLEY: Why that face?

2106
01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:39.850
TRAVIS: What are you rolling? What d number?

2107
01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:41.816
SAM: 13d2s, it's fine.

2108
01:18:41.816 --> 01:18:43.516
TRAVIS: Yep. Just coins.

2109
01:18:44.529 --> 01:18:46.637
MATT: You take 30 points of necrotic damage.

2110
01:18:46.637 --> 01:18:47.470
ASHLEY: Okay.

2111
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:49.222
MATT: And your maximum hit points are reduced by 30.

2112
01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:50.055
SAM: Woof!

2113
01:18:51.398 --> 01:18:52.619
TRAVIS: (incredulous laughing)

2114
01:18:52.619 --> 01:18:55.628
MATT: As its proboscis jams into your sternum area,

2115
01:18:55.628 --> 01:18:58.969
and narrowly misses your stomach on the inside,

2116
01:18:58.969 --> 01:19:00.289
you grab it and try--

2117
01:19:00.289 --> 01:19:02.488
ASHLEY: I'm resistant to necrotic.

2118
01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.188
ASHLEY: You take half of that, so you take 15

2119
01:19:04.188 --> 01:19:05.887
and your maximum hit points are reduced by 15.

2120
01:19:05.887 --> 01:19:07.337
(cheering)

2121
01:19:07.337 --> 01:19:08.737
LAURA: Oh, that's clutch!

2122
01:19:08.737 --> 01:19:09.628
SAM: Holy shit.

2123
01:19:09.628 --> 01:19:12.708
MATT: As your fallen essence manages to resist

2124
01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:13.729
and your strength kicks in

2125
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:15.717
and you hold it from piercing further into your body

2126
01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:16.900
and you just stare it in the face

2127
01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.548
as you withdraw it from your body

2128
01:19:18.548 --> 01:19:20.060
and throw it up into the air.

2129
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.277
(buzzing)

2130
01:19:21.277 --> 01:19:22.369
ASHLEY: Fucking right!

2131
01:19:22.369 --> 01:19:23.228
TRAVIS: So clutch.

2132
01:19:23.228 --> 01:19:25.988
MATT: It is going to attempt to fly out of your melee range,

2133
01:19:25.988 --> 01:19:27.479
you do get an attack of opportunity.

2134
01:19:27.479 --> 01:19:28.495
MARISHA: Yes!

2135
01:19:28.495 --> 01:19:29.896
Come on, come on!

2136
01:19:33.058 --> 01:19:34.879
ASHLEY: Do I have to say reckless before I roll?

2137
01:19:34.879 --> 01:19:35.900
MATT: Reckless you have to do on your turn.

2138
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.919
ASHLEY: Gah!

2139
01:19:36.919 --> 01:19:39.169
Okay, I don't--let's see.

2140
01:19:40.867 --> 01:19:41.700
12?

2141
01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.533
MATT: 12 misses.

2142
01:19:42.533 --> 01:19:43.479
ASHLEY: Ah, fuck you!

2143
01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:44.529
MATT: It dives down to attack you

2144
01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:46.139
and then pulls out of the way

2145
01:19:46.139 --> 01:19:47.587
after you angrily withdraw it--

2146
01:19:47.587 --> 01:19:50.082
ASHLEY: Yeah, you--yeah, you fucking run! You fly!

2147
01:19:50.082 --> 01:19:52.443
MATT: You swing wide and it ducks out of the way

2148
01:19:52.443 --> 01:19:55.286
and it's now 20 feet up in the air.

2149
01:19:55.286 --> 01:19:56.119
ASHLEY: Dammit!

2150
01:19:56.119 --> 01:19:58.702
MATT: That finishes its turn. All righty.

2151
01:19:58.702 --> 01:19:59.854
Caleb, you're up.

2152
01:19:59.854 --> 01:20:01.881
LIAM: Caleb has just been badly bludgeoned

2153
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.385
and turns back around, blood matting his hair,

2154
01:20:04.385 --> 01:20:06.974
and (groaning). This isn't what I was planning at all.

2155
01:20:06.974 --> 01:20:10.202
But pull out the cocoon and start muttering arcane words

2156
01:20:10.202 --> 01:20:14.403
and I will cast Polymorph on the giant thing attacking me.

2157
01:20:14.403 --> 01:20:16.433
17 to beat wisdom save.

2158
01:20:16.433 --> 01:20:17.600
MATT: Wisdom save.

2159
01:20:18.962 --> 01:20:19.795
Here we go.

2160
01:20:19.795 --> 01:20:21.145
LIAM: Come on.

2161
01:20:21.145 --> 01:20:22.562
SAM: It can't be very wise, right?

2162
01:20:22.562 --> 01:20:23.745
MATT: That is 16.

2163
01:20:23.745 --> 01:20:25.995
(cheering)

2164
01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.709
LIAM: Giant tortoise.

2165
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:30.273
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, thank you!

2166
01:20:30.273 --> 01:20:32.185
I've been waiting for somebody to do a tortoise.

2167
01:20:32.185 --> 01:20:35.655
Good job you beautiful wizard bastard!

2168
01:20:35.655 --> 01:20:36.963
MATT: Giant tortoise.

2169
01:20:36.963 --> 01:20:38.192
LIAM: He's just bleeding and going (groaning).

2170
01:20:38.192 --> 01:20:39.381
LAURA: Are you guys still--

2171
01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:40.935
MARISHA: That was what I was going to say,

2172
01:20:40.935 --> 01:20:42.568
are we still scared of the turtle?

2173
01:20:42.568 --> 01:20:43.401
MATT: Um--

2174
01:20:43.401 --> 01:20:45.967
(laughter)

2175
01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:49.024
LAURA: You got to strain your neck a little bit more.

2176
01:20:49.024 --> 01:20:50.315
(laughter)

2177
01:20:50.315 --> 01:20:52.153
MATT: It's technically--

2178
01:20:52.153 --> 01:20:54.265
LIAM: Very scary turtle.

2179
01:20:54.265 --> 01:20:55.926
TRAVIS: You've heard the sound it makes, right?

2180
01:20:55.926 --> 01:20:58.275
MARISHA: Turtles are so cute!

2181
01:20:58.275 --> 01:21:01.023
MATT: It's technically a special effect of its ability--

2182
01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:02.404
I'll say, I'll give you an advantage on your saves

2183
01:21:02.404 --> 01:21:03.324
to resist it.

2184
01:21:03.324 --> 01:21:06.140
MARISHA: Okay, because he's a cute turtle now.

2185
01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.284
LIAM: It's really scary, but so cute.

2186
01:21:08.284 --> 01:21:10.231
MATT: It's not gone, but you do get advantage on the saves,

2187
01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:11.447
because now it's a turtle.

2188
01:21:11.447 --> 01:21:13.516
You're still like, I know it's a turtle,

2189
01:21:13.516 --> 01:21:15.549
but in that turtle's something really fucked up

2190
01:21:15.549 --> 01:21:17.186
and it's really scaring me.

2191
01:21:17.186 --> 01:21:19.111
MATT: I don't have a giant turtle mini,

2192
01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:20.276
so I'll just use this.

2193
01:21:20.276 --> 01:21:23.087
LIAM: What a failure you are, why are you even here?

2194
01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:24.076
MATT: You're right, you're right.

2195
01:21:24.076 --> 01:21:25.015
TRAVIS: A horse?

2196
01:21:25.015 --> 01:21:26.015
MARISHA: Everything's a horse.

2197
01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:27.135
LIAM: Caleb is going to attempt,

2198
01:21:27.135 --> 01:21:28.164
I don't know if the tortoise

2199
01:21:28.164 --> 01:21:29.415
will get an attack of opportunity,

2200
01:21:29.415 --> 01:21:31.196
but Caleb is going to drag his--

2201
01:21:31.196 --> 01:21:32.684
ASHLEY: Oh my god that was so fast!

2202
01:21:32.684 --> 01:21:33.734
LAURA: (cheering)

2203
01:21:33.734 --> 01:21:34.676
MARISHA: Fuck yes.

2204
01:21:34.676 --> 01:21:35.940
SAM: Don't show the logos!

2205
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.135
LAURA: Just kidding, no logos.

2206
01:21:38.135 --> 01:21:40.635
SAM: Matt, maybe you heard--

2207
01:21:43.401 --> 01:21:47.276
Matt, Liam made it a tortoise not a horse.

2208
01:21:47.276 --> 01:21:48.109
MATT: What's up?

2209
01:21:48.109 --> 01:21:50.095
SAM: It's supposed to be a tortoise not a horse.

2210
01:21:50.095 --> 01:21:50.928
LIAM: He knows.

2211
01:21:50.928 --> 01:21:53.986
SAM: So just make it a tortoise.

2212
01:21:53.986 --> 01:21:55.436
MATT: Okay, a giant tortoise, you said?

2213
01:21:55.436 --> 01:21:56.564
(laughter)

2214
01:21:56.564 --> 01:21:57.786
A giant snapping turtle?

2215
01:21:57.786 --> 01:21:59.135
LIAM: What the equivalent is yeah, I imagine--

2216
01:21:59.135 --> 01:22:00.726
TRAVIS: No, not a snapping turtle!

2217
01:22:00.726 --> 01:22:02.204
LIAM: Giant tortoise is what I said.

2218
01:22:02.204 --> 01:22:03.337
MATT: Right.

2219
01:22:03.337 --> 01:22:05.516
The closest thing there is to a giant tortoise--

2220
01:22:05.516 --> 01:22:07.116
LIAM: He's the DM, let him do what he wants!

2221
01:22:07.116 --> 01:22:09.095
MARISHA: He grew up in Texas, he knows.

2222
01:22:09.095 --> 01:22:11.095
LIAM: Sounds right.

2223
01:22:11.095 --> 01:22:13.895
TRAVIS: Giant snapping turtles have the highest bite ratio--

2224
01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:16.866
MATT: A giant snapping turtle is the closest I can find

2225
01:22:16.866 --> 01:22:18.666
to what you requested, which is a giant tortoise.

2226
01:22:18.666 --> 01:22:19.915
LIAM: Great, I have no problem with that.

2227
01:22:19.915 --> 01:22:22.082
Unlike Travis, I like all your decisions, Matthew.

2228
01:22:22.082 --> 01:22:23.231
Would you like a donut?

2229
01:22:23.231 --> 01:22:24.364
MARISHA: Of course I would like a donut.

2230
01:22:24.364 --> 01:22:25.626
LIAM: Ooh, smell that sugar.

2231
01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:27.765
LAURA: Don't show the logo!
Don't show the logo!

2232
01:22:27.765 --> 01:22:30.015
(laughter)

2233
01:22:31.093 --> 01:22:33.491
This is a terrible idea. What have you done, Laura?

2234
01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:34.857
Well for that, the snapping turtle's

2235
01:22:34.857 --> 01:22:35.793
getting an attack of opportunity.

2236
01:22:35.793 --> 01:22:36.626
LAURA: No!

2237
01:22:36.626 --> 01:22:37.786
(laughter)

2238
01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.106
MATT: It rolled a natural 17.

2239
01:22:39.106 --> 01:22:40.419
LIAM: I'm at 20 right now--

2240
01:22:40.419 --> 01:22:41.641
MATT: 23 to hit.

2241
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:42.832
LIAM: Oh, 23 that hits.

2242
01:22:43.907 --> 01:22:44.882
LIAM: (high-pitched noise)

2243
01:22:46.371 --> 01:22:48.204
MARISHA: Fuck. What do I do with this thing?

2244
01:22:48.204 --> 01:22:49.645
SAM: Did the turtle just whinny?

2245
01:22:49.645 --> 01:22:51.020
TRAVIS: Throw it on the ground!

2246
01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.253
LIAM: No. (high-pitched noise)

2247
01:22:52.253 --> 01:22:53.086
SAM: Oh, okay.

2248
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:55.728
MATT: You motherfucker.

2249
01:22:55.728 --> 01:22:57.978
(laughter)

2250
01:22:59.048 --> 01:23:00.478
MATT: 18 points of bludgeoning damage.

2251
01:23:00.478 --> 01:23:01.311
SAM: Jeez!

2252
01:23:01.311 --> 01:23:02.894
LAURA: What?

2253
01:23:02.894 --> 01:23:03.899
For a turtle?

2254
01:23:03.899 --> 01:23:06.387
MATT: Giant creatures can still do damage!

2255
01:23:06.387 --> 01:23:08.027
Not--like, pretty well.

2256
01:23:08.027 --> 01:23:10.154
LIAM: Good, fine, great done.

2257
01:23:10.154 --> 01:23:11.446
MARISHA: Wait but you turned it into a turtle

2258
01:23:11.446 --> 01:23:12.279
and then it attacked you?

2259
01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:13.357
LIAM: Well I ran away from it,

2260
01:23:13.357 --> 01:23:15.527
thinking that it would try to gum my ankle,

2261
01:23:15.527 --> 01:23:18.286
but instead took my foot off.

2262
01:23:18.286 --> 01:23:19.597
MATT: You said a giant turtle--

2263
01:23:19.597 --> 01:23:21.557
LIAM: It's fine, I'm not questioning you!

2264
01:23:21.557 --> 01:23:22.677
MARISHA: Turtles don't fuck around.

2265
01:23:22.677 --> 01:23:23.536
MATT: I know.

2266
01:23:23.536 --> 01:23:25.308
TALIESIN: Giant turtle'll fuck you up, man.

2267
01:23:25.308 --> 01:23:26.649
(laughter)

2268
01:23:26.649 --> 01:23:27.890
SAM: It's too sweet.

2269
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:28.723
LAURA: Fuck you.

2270
01:23:28.723 --> 01:23:30.934
SAM: I ate the whole thing.

2271
01:23:30.934 --> 01:23:32.376
MATT: That ends your turn, Caleb?

2272
01:23:32.376 --> 01:23:33.711
LIAM: It certainly does.

2273
01:23:33.711 --> 01:23:35.605
MATT: That brings us to Beau.

2274
01:23:35.605 --> 01:23:36.438
MARISHA: Okay.

2275
01:23:36.438 --> 01:23:38.565
MATT: You are frightened still.

2276
01:23:38.565 --> 01:23:39.926
MARISHA: Do I save now or at the end of my turn?

2277
01:23:39.926 --> 01:23:40.906
MATT: End of your turn.

2278
01:23:40.906 --> 01:23:43.298
MARISHA: I can't move towards the turtle?

2279
01:23:43.298 --> 01:23:44.131
MATT: Correct.

2280
01:23:44.131 --> 01:23:46.018
(laughter)

2281
01:23:46.018 --> 01:23:48.636
You are unable to move towards the turtle.

2282
01:23:48.636 --> 01:23:49.506
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

2283
01:23:49.506 --> 01:23:51.975
MARISHA: Can I move this way?

2284
01:23:51.975 --> 01:23:54.915
Does this way count, away from the turtle, or do I have to--

2285
01:23:54.915 --> 01:23:59.447
MATT: Yeah, you can move at an angle away from the turtle

2286
01:23:59.447 --> 01:24:01.495
in that direction, but not directly towards the turtle.

2287
01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:02.893
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2288
01:24:02.893 --> 01:24:03.954
LIAM: This is very serious.

2289
01:24:03.954 --> 01:24:06.055
(laughter)

2290
01:24:06.055 --> 01:24:07.426
LAURA: We all laugh until we all die.

2291
01:24:07.426 --> 01:24:08.295
TALIESIN: From a turtle.

2292
01:24:08.295 --> 01:24:09.634
MARISHA: Shit.

2293
01:24:09.634 --> 01:24:11.255
TRAVIS: One turtle to rule them all.

2294
01:24:11.255 --> 01:24:12.285
MARISHA: So--

2295
01:24:12.285 --> 01:24:14.063
TRAVIS: Standing over a mound of corpses.

2296
01:24:14.063 --> 01:24:17.245
MATT: That guy is, by the way, ten feet off the ground.

2297
01:24:17.245 --> 01:24:18.866
TRAVIS: 20 feet.

2298
01:24:18.866 --> 01:24:21.674
MATT: Sorry. Well, he's 20 feet up in the air.

2299
01:24:21.674 --> 01:24:24.258
He's a large creature that takes a ten-foot space,

2300
01:24:24.258 --> 01:24:28.070
so he's about ten feet above you.

2301
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:30.795
MARISHA: There's no way I can get in my melee range?

2302
01:24:30.795 --> 01:24:32.426
LAURA: Can you leap off Yasha?

2303
01:24:32.426 --> 01:24:34.326
MARISHA: Can I leap off of this thing?

2304
01:24:34.326 --> 01:24:36.834
MATT: Even with that, your best bet is either to parkour

2305
01:24:36.834 --> 01:24:39.583
off of a pillar or jump.

2306
01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:41.570
MARISHA: That's fine, yeah.

2307
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:45.391
As I run forward, I'm going to loop wide,

2308
01:24:45.391 --> 01:24:50.140
I'm going to do a cool slide under Yasha's legs

2309
01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.071
and I'm going to tap my knuckles

2310
01:24:52.071 --> 01:24:55.599
and light up my lightning gloves and as I slide under,

2311
01:24:55.599 --> 01:24:56.999
I'm going to go: pew pew!

2312
01:24:56.999 --> 01:24:58.439
MATT: That's right, because you have the lightning gloves,

2313
01:24:58.439 --> 01:24:59.791
you have the ranged, yeah!

2314
01:24:59.791 --> 01:25:00.770
LAURA: Are they still holy?

2315
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:01.679
No, they're not holy?

2316
01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:03.940
MARISHA: They're still holy, with the lightning.

2317
01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:04.773
TALIESIN: I should know,

2318
01:25:04.773 --> 01:25:06.119
and I will have a sense of when its going to go.

2319
01:25:06.119 --> 01:25:08.759
It's an hour. I don't think it's been an hour.

2320
01:25:08.759 --> 01:25:10.271
MATT: It's not been an hour, the effect is still there.

2321
01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:12.031
TALIESIN: I feel like I would have a sense

2322
01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:13.776
when it's starting to go, right?

2323
01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:14.609
MATT: You will, yeah.

2324
01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:17.441
TALIESIN: Okay, so yeah, because I want to know before--

2325
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:18.581
MATT: They're still my unarmed attacks,

2326
01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:21.646
and they're still with my fists.

2327
01:25:21.646 --> 01:25:23.602
MATT: They are, it does increase the range of the attack.

2328
01:25:23.602 --> 01:25:24.901
MARISHA: (reading) "At the start of your turn, you channel

2329
01:25:24.901 --> 01:25:26.970
"atmospheric electricity through the gloves,

2330
01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:28.810
"extending your reach."

2331
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:31.951
TALIESIN: Yeah, and the spell is crippling me really badly.

2332
01:25:31.951 --> 01:25:34.938
MATT: Yep, no. So what happens is the essence

2333
01:25:34.938 --> 01:25:37.351
of the Holy Weapon channels through the bolts as you fire.

2334
01:25:37.351 --> 01:25:38.504
I'll allow it.

2335
01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:41.062
MARISHA: Hey, hey, hey!

2336
01:25:41.062 --> 01:25:42.501
MATT: As you slide through

2337
01:25:42.501 --> 01:25:46.194
and make your way underneath to that point.

2338
01:25:46.194 --> 01:25:47.943
Go ahead and make your attacks.

2339
01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:48.962
They are at disadvantage,

2340
01:25:48.962 --> 01:25:51.562
because you can still see the giant turtle shell

2341
01:25:51.562 --> 01:25:53.474
coming up through the stairs.

2342
01:25:53.474 --> 01:25:55.140
MARISHA: Really?
MATT: Yep.

2343
01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.807
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: Scary shell.

2344
01:25:56.807 --> 01:25:57.957
MARISHA: Even though I'm not fighting the turtle?

2345
01:25:57.957 --> 01:25:58.795
MATT: Yep.

2346
01:25:58.795 --> 01:26:00.461
MARISHA: Disadvantage?
MATT: Yep.

2347
01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:01.354
MARISHA: Oh, that was cocked, isn't it?

2348
01:26:01.354 --> 01:26:02.187
TRAVIS: No.

2349
01:26:02.187 --> 01:26:04.354
MARISHA: Oh wait, maybe it's not.

2350
01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:07.354
Cocked.

2351
01:26:07.354 --> 01:26:09.854
Well, it's the lower one, anyway.

2352
01:26:10.829 --> 01:26:11.751
25.

2353
01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:12.584
MATT: 25 hits.

2354
01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.463
The first attack hits.

2355
01:26:18.463 --> 01:26:20.160
MARISHA: Plus the 2d8.

2356
01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.773
MATT: Correct, so roll the damage dice together

2357
01:26:21.773 --> 01:26:23.063
and then add your modifier.

2358
01:26:23.063 --> 01:26:25.962
MARISHA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Uh-huh!

2359
01:26:25.962 --> 01:26:27.879
MARISHA: Eight plus seven, 15,

2360
01:26:28.801 --> 01:26:31.802
plus another six from my modifier, so 21 total.

2361
01:26:31.802 --> 01:26:33.764
MATT: So 21 the first strike. Go for it.

2362
01:26:33.764 --> 01:26:34.597
MARISHA: Second strike.

2363
01:26:34.597 --> 01:26:37.030
MATT: You arc down, (crackling) and punch upward.

2364
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:38.882
MARISHA: An 18 and 15 again, so 25 again.

2365
01:26:38.882 --> 01:26:39.715
MATT: 25 hits.

2366
01:26:39.715 --> 01:26:42.122
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Ghost puncher.

2367
01:26:42.122 --> 01:26:43.789
TALIESIN: Puncher of ghosts.

2368
01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:49.391
MARISHA: 12, another 15 points, plus another six, 21 again!

2369
01:26:49.391 --> 01:26:50.573
MATT: 21.

2370
01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:51.543
(thudding)

2371
01:26:51.543 --> 01:26:53.853
You guys watch as this room is bright with daylight

2372
01:26:53.853 --> 01:26:56.252
as it filled the chamber, Beau slides underneath

2373
01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:59.333
and is punching lightning bolts up underneath

2374
01:26:59.333 --> 01:27:00.851
and they're blasting into the chasme and it's

2375
01:27:00.851 --> 01:27:04.536
(thudding) trying to escape, but it can't seem to dodge it.

2376
01:27:04.536 --> 01:27:05.369
That's your attack action?

2377
01:27:05.369 --> 01:27:07.146
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows?
MATT: Flurry of Blows.

2378
01:27:07.146 --> 01:27:08.735
ASHLEY: Yasha's jaw is on the floor.

2379
01:27:08.735 --> 01:27:13.266
MATT: Is there an action required to trigger the ability?

2380
01:27:13.266 --> 01:27:14.205
MARISHA: (reading) "At the start of your turn."

2381
01:27:14.205 --> 01:27:15.354
MATT: Start of your turn, yeah, you're good.

2382
01:27:15.354 --> 01:27:17.078
MARISHA: "You can channel for one minute."

2383
01:27:17.078 --> 01:27:18.236
MATT: Go for it.

2384
01:27:18.236 --> 01:27:23.234
MARISHA: What did I roll? A 12 and a three, not good.

2385
01:27:23.234 --> 01:27:24.293
MATT: Three is?

2386
01:27:24.293 --> 01:27:25.421
MARISHA: 13.
MATT: 13 misses.

2387
01:27:25.421 --> 01:27:27.487
MARISHA: Misses? Next one.

2388
01:27:27.487 --> 01:27:29.072
MATT: You used another ki point for Flurry of Blows,

2389
01:27:29.072 --> 01:27:30.143
final attack, go for it.

2390
01:27:30.143 --> 01:27:31.724
ASHLEY: Dang monks.

2391
01:27:31.724 --> 01:27:33.285
MARISHA: Fuck, natural one.

2392
01:27:33.285 --> 01:27:34.118
MATT: Natural one.

2393
01:27:34.118 --> 01:27:35.583
The first two arcs slam into it,

2394
01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:36.893
but it's starting to get wise from your strikes

2395
01:27:36.893 --> 01:27:38.034
and the last two follow ups,

2396
01:27:38.034 --> 01:27:41.872
it manages to (buzzing), and avoid.

2397
01:27:41.872 --> 01:27:42.949
That finishes your turn, Beau?

2398
01:27:42.949 --> 01:27:43.782
MARISHA: Yes.

2399
01:27:43.782 --> 01:27:46.692
MATT: Next up in the round is Fjord.

2400
01:27:46.692 --> 01:27:47.525
TRAVIS: Me?

2401
01:27:47.525 --> 01:27:49.431
MATT: Yeah. You're frightened of that turtle.

2402
01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:50.456
You look over at that stairway

2403
01:27:50.456 --> 01:27:53.503
and that turtle is there going (jaw clacking).

2404
01:27:53.503 --> 01:27:57.828
TRAVIS: (fake crying) Eldritch Blast!

2405
01:27:57.828 --> 01:28:00.207
Two of them towards the--

2406
01:28:00.207 --> 01:28:01.345
MATT: Chasme, go for it.

2407
01:28:01.345 --> 01:28:03.135
Disadvantage on the attacks, because you are frightened.

2408
01:28:03.135 --> 01:28:04.445
MARISHA: Oh, I try to save from it!

2409
01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.650
MATT: That's right, with advantage.

2410
01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:09.116
MARISHA: What is it, wisdom saving throw?

2411
01:28:09.116 --> 01:28:10.306
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

2412
01:28:10.306 --> 01:28:12.160
MATT: Is that a natural one?
TRAVIS: It is.

2413
01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:14.244
LIAM and LAURA: Cocked, ca, ca, ca!

2414
01:28:14.244 --> 01:28:17.787
MARISHA: Oh, natural 19, 22.

2415
01:28:17.787 --> 01:28:18.837
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2416
01:28:18.837 --> 01:28:20.876
The first one misses with the natural one,

2417
01:28:20.876 --> 01:28:23.950
goes wide, and the second strike with disadvantage.

2418
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:24.783
TRAVIS: 16.

2419
01:28:24.783 --> 01:28:25.616
MATT: 16 hits.

2420
01:28:25.616 --> 01:28:26.449
TRAVIS: All right!

2421
01:28:28.707 --> 01:28:32.311
Ten plus five, 15 points of Eldritch Blast!

2422
01:28:32.311 --> 01:28:33.144
MATT: Nice.

2423
01:28:34.297 --> 01:28:36.497
LAURA: What is that drink that you have there, Fjord?

2424
01:28:36.497 --> 01:28:37.815
TRAVIS: This is muddy water.

2425
01:28:37.815 --> 01:28:38.648
LAURA: Can I have some?

2426
01:28:38.648 --> 01:28:39.481
TRAVIS: Nope.

2427
01:28:40.606 --> 01:28:42.864
MATT: That blast (splattering) hits the chasme.

2428
01:28:42.864 --> 01:28:47.737
The chasme's looking pretty tough now, pretty hurt,

2429
01:28:47.737 --> 01:28:50.217
it's starting to like, (buzzing)

2430
01:28:50.217 --> 01:28:52.676
and it's starting to turn towards that rift

2431
01:28:52.676 --> 01:28:55.426
and that finishes your go, Fjord.

2432
01:28:58.294 --> 01:28:59.366
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2433
01:28:59.366 --> 01:29:01.726
MATT: Okay, make your wisdom save with advantage

2434
01:29:01.726 --> 01:29:02.756
to see if you can get rid of the--

2435
01:29:02.756 --> 01:29:03.593
TRAVIS: With advantage?

2436
01:29:03.593 --> 01:29:05.209
MATT: Yeah. If you want to move also, you can.

2437
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:06.175
It's up to you.

2438
01:29:06.175 --> 01:29:09.060
MARISHA: (laughing) Everything is blast!

2439
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:09.893
TRAVIS: Nah.

2440
01:29:13.077 --> 01:29:13.910
19.

2441
01:29:16.046 --> 01:29:17.476
MATT: 19, all right, yes you're done.

2442
01:29:17.476 --> 01:29:18.766
Technically, Soorna would've gone before you

2443
01:29:18.766 --> 01:29:22.149
and I forgot to do that, so I'll do her turn next.

2444
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:23.227
Fjord no longer frightened.

2445
01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:24.920
TRAVIS: Pass that over to the--

2446
01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.306
TALIESIN: Oh man, it's just sitting there, too.

2447
01:29:26.306 --> 01:29:27.912
TRAVIS: --grumpy little tiefling.

2448
01:29:27.912 --> 01:29:29.070
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to remind that the next person

2449
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:31.118
who hits the turtle will do double damage

2450
01:29:31.118 --> 01:29:33.677
so let's make sure that the hit that hits that turtle--

2451
01:29:33.677 --> 01:29:34.667
LAURA: Yeah, but don't hit the turtle

2452
01:29:34.667 --> 01:29:36.308
because then it'll unpolymorph.

2453
01:29:36.308 --> 01:29:40.227
TALIESIN: I know, but like that roll over will be a thing.

2454
01:29:40.227 --> 01:29:44.937
MATT: Soorna is going to move around here,

2455
01:29:44.937 --> 01:29:49.116
push against the pillar, the pillar cracks.

2456
01:29:49.116 --> 01:29:51.045
She takes up her staff

2457
01:29:51.045 --> 01:29:54.615
and swings upward towards the chasme, two strikes.

2458
01:29:54.615 --> 01:29:56.545
SAM: Two strikes! That chasme's gone!

2459
01:29:56.545 --> 01:29:59.563
MATT: First one is 17, that hits.

2460
01:29:59.563 --> 01:30:00.965
TALIESIN: She's going to kill another one.

2461
01:30:00.965 --> 01:30:04.466
MATT: Second attack misses, actually.

2462
01:30:04.466 --> 01:30:06.829
The first attack is going to be...

2463
01:30:06.829 --> 01:30:07.797
TRAVIS: Raid!

2464
01:30:10.422 --> 01:30:11.255
MATT: Yeah.

2465
01:30:11.255 --> 01:30:13.161
(thudding) Just slams into the chasme

2466
01:30:13.161 --> 01:30:15.153
and it gets thrown against the wall,

2467
01:30:15.153 --> 01:30:17.839
skids into where the arc is there on the side.

2468
01:30:17.839 --> 01:30:20.372
She takes her staff and pins it to it and pushes into it

2469
01:30:20.372 --> 01:30:21.993
and (crunching) pushes it against the wall.

2470
01:30:21.993 --> 01:30:25.753
(crunching) She shoves and it breaks through its abdomen

2471
01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:28.502
and it slumps inwards and withdraws it.

2472
01:30:28.502 --> 01:30:30.168
TALIESIN: She killed another one?
MATT: Yeah, she killed another one

2473
01:30:30.168 --> 01:30:31.593
TALIESIN: Damn!

2474
01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:32.667
SAM: Buzz off!

2475
01:30:32.667 --> 01:30:34.667
TRAVIS: Okay. Calm down.

2476
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:37.839
I took two points of psychic damage.

2477
01:30:37.839 --> 01:30:39.091
MARISHA: Disappointed in yourself.

2478
01:30:39.091 --> 01:30:40.869
MATT: Top of the round, Nott, you're up.

2479
01:30:40.869 --> 01:30:42.400
SAM: It's just us and the turtle?

2480
01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.883
MATT: At the moment, yeah.
SAM and LAURA: And the rift.

2481
01:30:46.883 --> 01:30:48.181
SAM: Ooh, that's rough.

2482
01:30:48.181 --> 01:30:53.181
Could I climb up to the ceiling on that pillar?

2483
01:30:53.701 --> 01:30:56.776
MATT: Yeah, make an athletics check.
SAM: Does it go all the way up?

2484
01:30:56.776 --> 01:30:57.840
MATT: It goes all the way.

2485
01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:58.673
They're both load bearing in the chamber.

2486
01:30:58.673 --> 01:31:01.160
SAM: Near the rift-ish?

2487
01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.920
MATT: The rift is right in this vicinity,

2488
01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.070
so you'd be about ten feet away.

2489
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:07.020
LAURA: What are you going to do?

2490
01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:09.331
SAM: I can look in at least?

2491
01:31:09.331 --> 01:31:10.781
I don't know, we can't close it, right?

2492
01:31:10.781 --> 01:31:13.566
We got to be ready for it.

2493
01:31:13.566 --> 01:31:14.709
(sighing)

2494
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:16.520
I can't shoot the turtle.

2495
01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.589
Shit, what do we do?

2496
01:31:18.589 --> 01:31:20.691
We got to get out of this room and seal it up somehow.

2497
01:31:20.691 --> 01:31:23.221
TALIESIN: We may not be able to close it 'till tomorrow,

2498
01:31:23.221 --> 01:31:24.989
that just might be a thing.

2499
01:31:24.989 --> 01:31:26.381
LAURA: Yeah, might have to sit here and wait.

2500
01:31:26.381 --> 01:31:27.269
MARISHA: Seal it and sleep?

2501
01:31:27.269 --> 01:31:28.829
TALIESIN: Seal it and sleep might be a way to go.

2502
01:31:28.829 --> 01:31:29.662
SAM: Ah!

2503
01:31:32.081 --> 01:31:33.299
Should I kill the turtle?

2504
01:31:33.299 --> 01:31:34.269
TRAVIS: No!

2505
01:31:34.269 --> 01:31:35.649
ASHLEY: I only get one per day.

2506
01:31:35.649 --> 01:31:37.372
LIAM: You've already used it.
ASHLEY: Yep.

2507
01:31:37.372 --> 01:31:38.659
SAM: Well, we got to kill the turtle at some point.

2508
01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.331
I'm going to hold my action.

2509
01:31:40.331 --> 01:31:41.389
LIAM: The turtle's a turtle for an hour.

2510
01:31:41.389 --> 01:31:45.880
SAM: And shoot the turtle when other people attack it.

2511
01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.019
Holding until when other people attack the turtle.

2512
01:31:48.019 --> 01:31:48.852
MATT: You got it.

2513
01:31:48.852 --> 01:31:49.897
That finishes your turn, Nott?

2514
01:31:49.897 --> 01:31:52.011
MARISHA: We're going to have to kill the turtle eventually.

2515
01:31:52.011 --> 01:31:53.544
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

2516
01:31:54.795 --> 01:31:59.594
SAM: Oh, before that, bonus action, take a swig of alcohol.

2517
01:31:59.594 --> 01:32:01.080
MATT: Okay.

2518
01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.109
SAM: Just a nice hefty swig.

2519
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:04.650
MATT: You've got it.

2520
01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:05.483
TRAVIS: Huh.

2521
01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:09.667
LIAM: Well, it is a turtle right now,

2522
01:32:09.667 --> 01:32:11.619
but if we could drag it to the center of the room,

2523
01:32:11.619 --> 01:32:13.638
I could trap it in a ring of fire,

2524
01:32:13.638 --> 01:32:15.427
drop one spell and throw another one up

2525
01:32:15.427 --> 01:32:19.019
and then everyone could whale on it.

2526
01:32:19.019 --> 01:32:20.547
TALIESIN: That seems.

2527
01:32:20.547 --> 01:32:22.377
I'm keeping an eye on that fucking rift, by the way.

2528
01:32:22.377 --> 01:32:26.219
MATT: Good. As you do, you watch as a tiny little jellyfish.

2529
01:32:26.219 --> 01:32:28.267
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

2530
01:32:28.267 --> 01:32:30.754
MATT: It's floating up here in the space there.

2531
01:32:30.754 --> 01:32:32.129
LIAM: (squeaky voice) Hi!

2532
01:32:33.587 --> 01:32:35.606
You're all going to die!

2533
01:32:35.606 --> 01:32:37.165
TALIESIN: We've got problems and we have no way

2534
01:32:37.165 --> 01:32:39.406
of closing this rift right now.

2535
01:32:39.406 --> 01:32:42.671
SAM: We can seal the whole room.

2536
01:32:42.671 --> 01:32:45.083
MATT: Next up is Yasha and Jester.

2537
01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:47.260
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Oh boy.

2538
01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.460
LIAM: (squeaky voice) I hunger!

2539
01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:51.210
LAURA: I guess I'm going to try to

2540
01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:54.101
attack the jellyfish then.

2541
01:32:55.324 --> 01:32:58.048
SAM: We are fucked.

2542
01:32:58.048 --> 01:32:59.608
ASHLEY: Turtle party kill.

2543
01:32:59.608 --> 01:33:01.688
(laughter)

2544
01:33:01.688 --> 01:33:02.558
LIAM: Wow.

2545
01:33:02.558 --> 01:33:04.587
TALIESIN: I got a weird theory.

2546
01:33:04.587 --> 01:33:06.659
Would I be under the impression that radiant damage

2547
01:33:06.659 --> 01:33:09.037
might actually affect the rift?

2548
01:33:09.037 --> 01:33:10.358
The way it actually damage the rift

2549
01:33:10.358 --> 01:33:13.248
through sheer magical force?

2550
01:33:13.248 --> 01:33:14.318
MATT: Make an arcana check.

2551
01:33:14.318 --> 01:33:15.231
TALIESIN: All right.

2552
01:33:15.231 --> 01:33:17.131
MARISHA: That was good!

2553
01:33:17.131 --> 01:33:17.964
TALIESIN: 17.

2554
01:33:17.964 --> 01:33:20.507
MATT: 17? You're not sure.

2555
01:33:20.507 --> 01:33:21.827
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

2556
01:33:21.827 --> 01:33:23.547
SAM: Does your druidic giant friend

2557
01:33:23.547 --> 01:33:25.528
have any sort of magic that can?

2558
01:33:25.528 --> 01:33:28.332
TALIESIN: I got to wait until my turn.

2559
01:33:28.332 --> 01:33:29.747
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at the jellyfish.

2560
01:33:29.747 --> 01:33:31.330
MATT: At the jellyfish.

2561
01:33:32.338 --> 01:33:35.528
Natural 18. What's the DC on that?

2562
01:33:35.528 --> 01:33:36.550
LAURA: 17.

2563
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:38.019
MATT: Yeah, so, it managed to--

2564
01:33:38.019 --> 01:33:39.707
it does still take half damage I believe, right?

2565
01:33:39.707 --> 01:33:40.540
LAURA: No.

2566
01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.494
MATT: No, Sacred Flame does not, it's a cantrip.

2567
01:33:42.494 --> 01:33:45.227
Manages to dodge the impact. Yasha.

2568
01:33:45.227 --> 01:33:47.120
Do you want to move or stay put?

2569
01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:50.510
LAURA: I mean, if I move the stupid turtle will attack me.

2570
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:51.930
TALIESIN: I don't think you're within.

2571
01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:53.449
MATT: The turtle technically--

2572
01:33:53.449 --> 01:33:54.282
LAURA: It's down the stairs?

2573
01:33:54.282 --> 01:33:55.667
MATT: Actually, no, you would be.

2574
01:33:55.667 --> 01:33:57.987
It's on the stairs, but it's the step below

2575
01:33:57.987 --> 01:33:59.086
because it's a large creature.

2576
01:33:59.086 --> 01:34:00.316
You are within its melee range.

2577
01:34:00.316 --> 01:34:02.837
TALIESIN: Did it already have reaction though?

2578
01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:04.503
MATT: It did! It did, yeah.

2579
01:34:04.503 --> 01:34:06.976
LAURA: Okay, then I am going to back away from the turtle.

2580
01:34:06.976 --> 01:34:07.809
MATT: Where are you going?

2581
01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:10.396
LAURA: Against the wall, this way, in the little corner.

2582
01:34:10.396 --> 01:34:11.396
TALIESIN: Good call.

2583
01:34:12.427 --> 01:34:13.260
LAURA: Yeah, there.

2584
01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:16.492
MATT: All righty. Finishes your go, Jester. Yasha.

2585
01:34:16.492 --> 01:34:19.228
ASHLEY: Okay, well.

2586
01:34:19.228 --> 01:34:20.639
MATT: I'll just ask you guys to go get the minis

2587
01:34:20.639 --> 01:34:23.885
whenever you polymorph anything from now on.

2588
01:34:23.885 --> 01:34:26.609
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to attack the jellyfish.

2589
01:34:26.609 --> 01:34:28.708
MATT: All righty, go for it.

2590
01:34:28.708 --> 01:34:31.630
It is about 20 feet up in the air.

2591
01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:35.228
You'll have to make another jump to try and reach it--

2592
01:34:35.228 --> 01:34:37.488
SAM: Someone give Yasha some goddamn javelins.

2593
01:34:37.488 --> 01:34:41.827
ASHLEY: Okay, so I rolled a 19.

2594
01:34:41.827 --> 01:34:43.617
MATT: You do have advantage in this because you're raging,

2595
01:34:43.617 --> 01:34:44.450
don't forget.

2596
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:47.985
ASHLEY: This is for athletics first, okay.

2597
01:34:47.985 --> 01:34:49.402
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. 22.

2598
01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.889
MATT: 22, all right.

2599
01:34:52.889 --> 01:34:55.129
You leap, you think you might be able to crest it

2600
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:58.039
with one hit so attempt that.

2601
01:35:00.255 --> 01:35:02.468
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, 22 again.

2602
01:35:02.468 --> 01:35:04.257
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

2603
01:35:04.257 --> 01:35:05.090
ASHLEY: Okay.

2604
01:35:08.763 --> 01:35:10.838
Okay, okay, okay.

2605
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:13.181
It's ten...

2606
01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:16.384
17 points of damage.

2607
01:35:16.384 --> 01:35:18.125
MATT: 17, nice.

2608
01:35:18.125 --> 01:35:19.252
(slashing) You carve past it

2609
01:35:19.252 --> 01:35:22.941
and you see an element of its hanging,

2610
01:35:22.941 --> 01:35:27.704
semi-translucent, dangling tentacles

2611
01:35:27.704 --> 01:35:29.167
(slurping) get shaved off

2612
01:35:29.167 --> 01:35:32.407
and (fizzling) turn into a weird mist and then disappear.

2613
01:35:32.407 --> 01:35:34.727
It recoils and pulls up that part of its body

2614
01:35:34.727 --> 01:35:36.632
before it begins to reform them.

2615
01:35:36.632 --> 01:35:39.614
That finishes your turn?

2616
01:35:39.614 --> 01:35:41.831
Yeah, you'll still probably be in place to do that.

2617
01:35:41.831 --> 01:35:43.983
You'll probably have to move up to this platform.

2618
01:35:43.983 --> 01:35:45.775
ASHLEY: Okay, that's fine, yep.

2619
01:35:45.775 --> 01:35:49.004
MATT: That finishes Yasha's go. All right.

2620
01:35:49.004 --> 01:35:50.415
Now the turtle's turn.

2621
01:35:50.415 --> 01:35:51.248
SAM: Yeah.

2622
01:35:51.248 --> 01:35:52.081
TRAVIS: Turtle power!

2623
01:35:52.081 --> 01:35:54.503
(laughter)

2624
01:35:54.503 --> 01:35:59.503
MATT: The turtle steps up, (thudding) up towards you Fjord.

2625
01:35:59.994 --> 01:36:00.994
TRAVIS: No. No.

2626
01:36:00.994 --> 01:36:02.234
MATT: You're the first thing there!

2627
01:36:02.234 --> 01:36:04.203
TRAVIS: I'm wearing Armor of Agathys.

2628
01:36:04.203 --> 01:36:05.036
MATT: Oh, shit, that's right!

2629
01:36:05.036 --> 01:36:06.306
SAM: What does that do?

2630
01:36:06.306 --> 01:36:08.004
LAURA: It damages the turtle.

2631
01:36:08.004 --> 01:36:09.826
MARISHA: So be ready.

2632
01:36:09.826 --> 01:36:10.716
Yeah.

2633
01:36:10.716 --> 01:36:13.076
MATT: It's going to make an attack against you, Fjord.

2634
01:36:13.076 --> 01:36:15.167
That is 15 to hit?

2635
01:36:15.167 --> 01:36:16.000
TRAVIS: Miss.

2636
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:16.833
It misses!

2637
01:36:17.876 --> 01:36:19.459
MATT: Nice!

2638
01:36:19.459 --> 01:36:20.459
All right, then.

2639
01:36:20.459 --> 01:36:21.775
TRAVIS: (frantic grunting)

2640
01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:22.983
(laughter)

2641
01:36:22.983 --> 01:36:24.476
TRAVIS: Fuck you, turtle!

2642
01:36:24.476 --> 01:36:25.453
MATT: What's your armor class again?

2643
01:36:25.453 --> 01:36:26.836
TRAVIS: 17.

2644
01:36:26.836 --> 01:36:28.074
MATT: That's right because of the breastplate

2645
01:36:28.074 --> 01:36:29.946
and the shield. That's awesome.

2646
01:36:29.946 --> 01:36:31.236
Yeah, it goes and tries to snap towards you

2647
01:36:31.236 --> 01:36:34.564
and you're like, No! (thudding) Reflect it back a bit.

2648
01:36:34.564 --> 01:36:35.555
It's unhappy.

2649
01:36:35.555 --> 01:36:37.809
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (imitating turtle)

2650
01:36:37.809 --> 01:36:40.554
MATT: It's going to use the rest of its movement.

2651
01:36:40.554 --> 01:36:42.251
to move around to this side.

2652
01:36:42.251 --> 01:36:44.046
SAM: Clip clop.

2653
01:36:44.046 --> 01:36:45.066
LAURA: Don't--stop it!

2654
01:36:45.066 --> 01:36:46.218
Stop being an asshole!

2655
01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:47.266
(laughter)

2656
01:36:47.266 --> 01:36:48.423
MATT: All righty.

2657
01:36:48.423 --> 01:36:50.736
MARISHA: That's a turtle of a different color!

2658
01:36:50.736 --> 01:36:53.422
LAURA: Stop being an asshole!

2659
01:36:53.422 --> 01:36:56.077
MATT: The DM will remember this.

2660
01:36:56.077 --> 01:37:00.456
All righty, so, finishing its turn, Caduceus, you're up.

2661
01:37:00.456 --> 01:37:02.239
TALIESIN: Bonus action, the insects are going to

2662
01:37:02.239 --> 01:37:04.471
attack the jellyfish.

2663
01:37:04.471 --> 01:37:05.437
MATT: Go for it.

2664
01:37:05.437 --> 01:37:06.470
Roll for attack.

2665
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:08.561
TRAVIS: (laughs) The turtle horse and the insects

2666
01:37:08.561 --> 01:37:10.689
on the jellyfish. Dungeons and dragons.

2667
01:37:10.689 --> 01:37:12.090
SAM: This is the weirdest fight ever.

2668
01:37:12.090 --> 01:37:13.112
MATT: It's pretty weird.

2669
01:37:13.112 --> 01:37:14.421
SAM: Scared of the turtle.

2670
01:37:14.421 --> 01:37:16.078
TALIESIN: Fucking, I don't even know why I bother. Eight.

2671
01:37:16.078 --> 01:37:17.598
MATT: Eight, no.

2672
01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:22.515
TALIESIN: It's like plus three to hit. It ain't never.

2673
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:28.201
Just out of idle curiosity,

2674
01:37:28.201 --> 01:37:29.352
I know I should really deal with this thing

2675
01:37:29.352 --> 01:37:32.352
because it's about to become a problem.

2676
01:37:32.352 --> 01:37:33.590
Fuck, man.

2677
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:34.423
I'm...

2678
01:37:36.624 --> 01:37:40.624
...going to fire Sacred Flame at the rift.

2679
01:37:41.504 --> 01:37:42.474
MATT: At the rift?

2680
01:37:42.474 --> 01:37:43.413
TALIESIN: Just curious.

2681
01:37:43.413 --> 01:37:44.253
MATT: Okay.

2682
01:37:44.253 --> 01:37:45.245
(powerful exhale) You release it.

2683
01:37:45.245 --> 01:37:48.544
You see a spark of divine energy. It has no effect on it.

2684
01:37:48.544 --> 01:37:50.205
TALIESIN: God fucking dammit.

2685
01:37:50.205 --> 01:37:51.038
It was a thought.

2686
01:37:51.038 --> 01:37:51.871
MATT: It was a thought.

2687
01:37:51.871 --> 01:37:52.704
LAURA: It was a good idea.

2688
01:37:52.704 --> 01:37:53.537
MATT: Are you going to stay put or

2689
01:37:53.537 --> 01:37:54.371
are you going to move around?

2690
01:37:54.371 --> 01:37:55.204
TALIESIN: Um, I'm...

2691
01:37:57.021 --> 01:37:57.854
I'm going to...

2692
01:37:59.503 --> 01:38:02.896
I'm going to stay put for now, yeah.

2693
01:38:02.896 --> 01:38:04.488
MATT: Okay, that finishes Caduceus's run.

2694
01:38:04.488 --> 01:38:06.317
No chasme, because it's dead.

2695
01:38:06.317 --> 01:38:07.296
Caleb, you're up.

2696
01:38:07.296 --> 01:38:08.997
LIAM: Okay, I'm moving away from the tortoise

2697
01:38:08.997 --> 01:38:11.968
but keeping an eye on it while I pull an adder's stomach

2698
01:38:11.968 --> 01:38:14.534
out of my pocket and drag it through the air

2699
01:38:14.534 --> 01:38:16.544
and a green line burns in the air in front of me

2700
01:38:16.544 --> 01:38:19.077
and (sizzling) acid arrow hits the jellyfish.

2701
01:38:19.077 --> 01:38:20.096
MATT: Roll for an attack.

2702
01:38:20.096 --> 01:38:22.871
LIAM: It is, I think it's a dex.

2703
01:38:24.336 --> 01:38:26.197
Oh, right, sorry, ranged spell attack.

2704
01:38:26.197 --> 01:38:27.417
Ooh, that's not so good.

2705
01:38:27.417 --> 01:38:31.880
That is six plus--it's just an elev--

2706
01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.192
oh no, it's not. It's 15.

2707
01:38:34.192 --> 01:38:36.131
MATT: 15. What's your spell attack bonus?

2708
01:38:36.131 --> 01:38:36.964
LIAM: Plus nine.

2709
01:38:36.964 --> 01:38:37.797
MATT: Plus nine.

2710
01:38:37.797 --> 01:38:38.672
LIAM: Says D&amp;D Beyond.

2711
01:38:38.672 --> 01:38:39.781
MATT: Right, and you rolled a?

2712
01:38:39.781 --> 01:38:40.614
LIAM: Six.

2713
01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:41.552
MATT: Six, yeah, so 15.

2714
01:38:41.552 --> 01:38:42.385
Nice.

2715
01:38:42.385 --> 01:38:45.461
That just hits, roll damage.

2716
01:38:45.461 --> 01:38:50.111
LIAM: Okay so Melf's Acid Arrow does 4d6 acid damage.

2717
01:38:50.111 --> 01:38:51.072
MATT: 4d4, I thought?

2718
01:38:51.072 --> 01:38:52.739
LIAM: Yeah, 4d4.

2719
01:38:55.226 --> 01:38:56.059
TRAVIS: Wow.

2720
01:38:56.059 --> 01:38:58.480
LIAM: 4d4 total. You heard it. He said it.

2721
01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.619
Two, four, five, six points of acid damage.

2722
01:39:02.619 --> 01:39:05.720
MATT: And it takes 2d4 on the next turn?

2723
01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.096
LIAM: 2d4 on the next, yeah.

2724
01:39:07.096 --> 01:39:07.968
MATT: You got it, cool.

2725
01:39:07.968 --> 01:39:11.299
I'm going to put a green marker on it

2726
01:39:11.299 --> 01:39:14.729
as the acid is splashed against it.

2727
01:39:14.729 --> 01:39:18.819
Actually, the acid splashes

2728
01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:23.735
and doesn't seem to scar it as much as you had hoped.

2729
01:39:23.735 --> 01:39:24.568
All righty.

2730
01:39:26.219 --> 01:39:27.425
That finishes your turn, Caleb?

2731
01:39:27.425 --> 01:39:29.092
LIAM: Yeah, I'm done.

2732
01:39:29.092 --> 01:39:31.587
No, I--yeah, I'm done.

2733
01:39:31.587 --> 01:39:33.755
MATT: All right, Beauregard, you're up.

2734
01:39:33.755 --> 01:39:38.532
MARISHA: I punch the jellyfish with my holy lightning chi.

2735
01:39:38.532 --> 01:39:39.477
MATT: Okay.

2736
01:39:39.477 --> 01:39:41.939
(laughter)

2737
01:39:41.939 --> 01:39:44.349
MARISHA: Do I have advantage or is it just regular?

2738
01:39:44.349 --> 01:39:45.298
Regular, right?

2739
01:39:45.298 --> 01:39:46.408
That was because I was frightened.

2740
01:39:46.408 --> 01:39:47.241
MATT: Correct.

2741
01:39:47.241 --> 01:39:48.597
MARISHA: Okay.

2742
01:39:48.597 --> 01:39:49.680
First attack.

2743
01:39:51.245 --> 01:39:52.176
That's balls.

2744
01:39:52.176 --> 01:39:53.009
15.

2745
01:39:53.009 --> 01:39:53.842
LAURA: 15 hits!

2746
01:39:53.842 --> 01:39:54.675
MARISHA: Eyy!

2747
01:39:58.980 --> 01:39:59.954
12.

2748
01:39:59.954 --> 01:40:01.195
MATT: 12 points of damage.

2749
01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.364
Go for it.

2750
01:40:02.364 --> 01:40:03.281
MARISHA: Next one.

2751
01:40:05.035 --> 01:40:06.202
That hits, 19.

2752
01:40:07.545 --> 01:40:11.104
That's 18 damage.

2753
01:40:11.104 --> 01:40:13.254
Oh wait, both of these are missing my modifier.

2754
01:40:13.254 --> 01:40:15.363
Plus another 12 on top of those two.

2755
01:40:15.363 --> 01:40:18.585
I should really remember my fucking damage modifier.

2756
01:40:18.585 --> 01:40:19.494
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2757
01:40:19.494 --> 01:40:20.863
MARISHA: Eyy!

2758
01:40:20.863 --> 01:40:25.574
MATT: The jellyfish emerges and is like (wet exploding).

2759
01:40:25.574 --> 01:40:29.814
MARISHA: I shrug a little, I look around,

2760
01:40:29.814 --> 01:40:33.310
and then I pew pew, taze it to death.

2761
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:36.483
MATT: Yep. You watch it (wet exploding),

2762
01:40:36.483 --> 01:40:38.163
and it detonates in the air,

2763
01:40:38.163 --> 01:40:41.571
splattering bits of its semi-translucent fleshy exterior,

2764
01:40:41.571 --> 01:40:42.945
wipe it off your armor a little bit.

2765
01:40:42.945 --> 01:40:44.174
LIAM: (high-pitched) Remember me!

2766
01:40:44.174 --> 01:40:46.483
LAURA: I hold up a little sign that has a seven on it.

2767
01:40:46.483 --> 01:40:48.385
(laughter)

2768
01:40:48.385 --> 01:40:51.129
MARISHA: I gymnast bow.

2769
01:40:51.129 --> 01:40:54.219
TALIESIN: Do we have any ideas for closing this rift?

2770
01:40:54.219 --> 01:40:57.478
TRAVIS: All right, guys, guys, the fucking tortle!

2771
01:40:57.478 --> 01:40:59.148
Ah, this tortoise!

2772
01:40:59.148 --> 01:41:02.150
MATT: That finishes Beau's turn?

2773
01:41:02.150 --> 01:41:03.590
MARISHA: Yeah, because everything's still going

2774
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.838
except for the turtle, right?

2775
01:41:04.838 --> 01:41:06.249
There's a rift and a turtle.

2776
01:41:06.249 --> 01:41:07.198
MATT: Yep.

2777
01:41:07.198 --> 01:41:08.950
TRAVIS: It's got me pinned against the wall!

2778
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:11.094
TALIESIN: It doesn't zero out the damage. It still takes--

2779
01:41:11.094 --> 01:41:12.710
LAURA: Yeah, it takes the damage.

2780
01:41:12.710 --> 01:41:16.818
MATT: Right now, so finishing Beau's turn,

2781
01:41:16.818 --> 01:41:20.489
Landspeaker Soorna's like, "I don't know,"

2782
01:41:20.489 --> 01:41:23.987
and is like looking at the turtle and pointing like--

2783
01:41:23.987 --> 01:41:25.587
TRAVIS: Come pick this thing up!

2784
01:41:25.587 --> 01:41:26.420
MATT: "What is to be done?"

2785
01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:27.339
TRAVIS: Get it away from me!

2786
01:41:27.339 --> 01:41:30.009
ASHLEY: Can I go over and try to pick it up?

2787
01:41:30.009 --> 01:41:31.718
TRAVIS: Put it on its back or something!

2788
01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:32.818
TALIESIN: How big is this turtle?

2789
01:41:32.818 --> 01:41:35.498
MATT: It's about, I'd say, eight foot front to back.

2790
01:41:35.498 --> 01:41:37.067
It's a giant turtle.

2791
01:41:37.067 --> 01:41:37.900
LAURA: Can we flip it?

2792
01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:39.878
I'll use a, I'll help, I can help.

2793
01:41:39.878 --> 01:41:42.038
We can do this together. Maybe we can flip it onto its back.

2794
01:41:42.038 --> 01:41:43.409
MATT: Okay, but we have to get to your turn first before--

2795
01:41:43.409 --> 01:41:45.058
LAURA: Oh, yeah yeah yeah, sorry.

2796
01:41:45.058 --> 01:41:46.299
MATT: So Fjord, you're up.

2797
01:41:46.299 --> 01:41:49.516
TRAVIS: This turtle is between me and everything else.

2798
01:41:49.516 --> 01:41:50.349
MATT: Yep.

2799
01:41:50.349 --> 01:41:51.182
It has you up against and the wall

2800
01:41:51.182 --> 01:41:53.757
and it's holding you and it's trying to snap

2801
01:41:53.757 --> 01:41:55.339
and push you into the wall.

2802
01:41:55.339 --> 01:41:58.281
TRAVIS: If I leave, it gets an attack of opportunity.

2803
01:41:58.281 --> 01:41:59.219
MATT: It does. What do you want to do?

2804
01:41:59.219 --> 01:42:00.659
TRAVIS: I can't leave!

2805
01:42:00.659 --> 01:42:01.492
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2806
01:42:01.492 --> 01:42:02.325
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2807
01:42:02.325 --> 01:42:03.739
I'm going to stand there and die.

2808
01:42:03.739 --> 01:42:05.158
(laughter)

2809
01:42:05.158 --> 01:42:09.574
TRAVIS: (screaming)
MATT: (snapping)

2810
01:42:09.574 --> 01:42:12.168
LIAM: For the record, when I said giant tortoise,

2811
01:42:12.168 --> 01:42:15.688
I imagined the big turtle I swam with in Hawaii.

2812
01:42:15.688 --> 01:42:19.737
It was so nice. I didn't mean an eight-foot t-rex!

2813
01:42:19.737 --> 01:42:24.042
TALIESIN: It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Liam!

2814
01:42:24.042 --> 01:42:26.147
Choose the form of your destroyer.

2815
01:42:26.147 --> 01:42:27.055
MATT: It's true.

2816
01:42:27.055 --> 01:42:28.546
That's exactly what it is.

2817
01:42:28.546 --> 01:42:30.314
If you want to polymorph something,

2818
01:42:30.314 --> 01:42:32.466
have the stats ready for what you want to polymorph.

2819
01:42:32.466 --> 01:42:33.299
LIAM: Yeah, I will, yeah.

2820
01:42:33.299 --> 01:42:35.164
MATT: Otherwise, when you say giant tortoise

2821
01:42:35.164 --> 01:42:37.226
and the only giant tortoise in this list

2822
01:42:37.226 --> 01:42:38.631
is a giant snapping turtle?

2823
01:42:38.631 --> 01:42:39.644
TALIESIN: That's what you get.

2824
01:42:39.644 --> 01:42:40.804
MATT: That's what you get.

2825
01:42:40.804 --> 01:42:42.104
LIAM: Didn't you see inside my head?

2826
01:42:42.104 --> 01:42:44.123
(laughter)

2827
01:42:44.123 --> 01:42:45.706
MATT: I tried to think.

2828
01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:48.066
What did you do, Ray?

2829
01:42:48.066 --> 01:42:48.899
Okay, so.

2830
01:42:50.341 --> 01:42:52.903
So Fjord spends his turn trying to hold back

2831
01:42:52.903 --> 01:42:54.072
the giant snapping turtle.

2832
01:42:54.072 --> 01:42:54.905
TRAVIS: Help me!

2833
01:42:54.905 --> 01:42:55.823
Help!

2834
01:42:55.823 --> 01:42:56.882
(laughter)

2835
01:42:56.882 --> 01:42:57.853
MATT: Nott, you're up.

2836
01:42:57.853 --> 01:42:59.520
TRAVIS: Can I take like a--?

2837
01:43:01.685 --> 01:43:06.149
MATT: You don't even have the room for it. You're like--

2838
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:07.482
TRAVIS: (shrieking) No!

2839
01:43:07.482 --> 01:43:10.026
(laughter)

2840
01:43:10.026 --> 01:43:11.215
MATT: What you doing Nott?

2841
01:43:11.215 --> 01:43:13.284
SAM: We're still not attacking this tortoise, right?

2842
01:43:13.284 --> 01:43:14.670
TRAVIS: (shrieking)

2843
01:43:14.670 --> 01:43:15.954
(laughter)

2844
01:43:15.954 --> 01:43:17.692
TRAVIS: (screaming)

2845
01:43:17.692 --> 01:43:18.558
SAM: Jesus.

2846
01:43:18.558 --> 01:43:20.408
(laughter)

2847
01:43:20.408 --> 01:43:22.583
LIAM: It's just as dangerous as...

2848
01:43:22.583 --> 01:43:25.166
TALIESIN: Are you saying this out loud?

2849
01:43:26.969 --> 01:43:27.980
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

2850
01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:29.722
MATT: Nott, what are you doing?

2851
01:43:29.722 --> 01:43:31.133
Use your turn.

2852
01:43:31.133 --> 01:43:33.522
SAM: I am going to use all my movement

2853
01:43:33.522 --> 01:43:37.034
and action to try to physically--no, I can't.

2854
01:43:37.034 --> 01:43:38.467
TRAVIS: (hysterical) Yes, help!

2855
01:43:39.425 --> 01:43:41.150
[JENGA]

2856
01:43:41.150 --> 01:43:43.392
(laughter)

2857
01:43:43.392 --> 01:43:47.493
SAM: I want to help Fjord, but I can't.

2858
01:43:47.493 --> 01:43:49.162
Sure, I'm going to run and jump

2859
01:43:49.162 --> 01:43:51.273
and tackle Fjord away from the tortoise,

2860
01:43:51.273 --> 01:43:54.106
hoping to shield him with my body.

2861
01:43:55.232 --> 01:43:57.873
MATT: With your giant goblinoid form.

2862
01:43:57.873 --> 01:43:59.513
SAM: Yes, my three foot body.

2863
01:43:59.513 --> 01:44:00.492
MATT: All right.

2864
01:44:00.492 --> 01:44:02.234
SAM: Just going to tackle Fjord away,

2865
01:44:02.234 --> 01:44:03.754
like a secret service person.

2866
01:44:03.754 --> 01:44:05.508
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

2867
01:44:05.508 --> 01:44:06.341
MATT: Make a strength check.

2868
01:44:06.341 --> 01:44:09.093
LAURA: You're just going to hug him and stay there.

2869
01:44:09.093 --> 01:44:11.593
SAM: Ooh, ooh, strength check?

2870
01:44:12.545 --> 01:44:13.619
Eight.

2871
01:44:13.619 --> 01:44:14.852
MATT: Eight?

2872
01:44:14.852 --> 01:44:17.802
You leap and wrap your arms around him.

2873
01:44:17.802 --> 01:44:20.712
The tortoise goes (snapping), you're like,

2874
01:44:20.712 --> 01:44:22.882
hiding behind his shield.

2875
01:44:22.882 --> 01:44:25.600
There's and Nott under Fjord's shield,

2876
01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.133
both being pressed up against the wall.

2877
01:44:27.133 --> 01:44:28.202
(laughter)

2878
01:44:28.202 --> 01:44:30.882
TALIESIN: This is going to go so badly.

2879
01:44:30.882 --> 01:44:31.912
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Nott?

2880
01:44:31.912 --> 01:44:32.745
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

2881
01:44:32.745 --> 01:44:33.578
MATT: Okay.

2882
01:44:34.904 --> 01:44:36.727
Yasha and Jester, what are you doing?

2883
01:44:36.727 --> 01:44:37.562
ASHLEY and LAURA: Hey!

2884
01:44:37.562 --> 01:44:38.820
LAURA: Let's run up.

2885
01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.626
ASHLEY: We're running over there--this is ridiculous.

2886
01:44:40.626 --> 01:44:42.236
LAURA: Like pull it back a little bit.

2887
01:44:42.236 --> 01:44:43.069
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab one of the

2888
01:44:43.069 --> 01:44:44.277
stumpy legs from the back.

2889
01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:46.193
LAURA: Me, too, from the back.

2890
01:44:47.255 --> 01:44:49.866
MATT: You can barely--in order to get up next to it,

2891
01:44:49.866 --> 01:44:51.004
it's going to take your action to dash

2892
01:44:51.004 --> 01:44:52.146
because you're moving so far away.

2893
01:44:52.146 --> 01:44:53.226
LAURA: No.

2894
01:44:53.226 --> 01:44:55.335
SAM: Also if you run behind, the horse might kick.

2895
01:44:55.335 --> 01:44:57.226
ASHLEY: Okay I'm going to try.

2896
01:44:57.226 --> 01:44:58.801
LAURA: I'm going to let her do it without me then,

2897
01:44:58.801 --> 01:44:59.700
because I can't.

2898
01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:01.116
ASHLEY: I'm going to try and go help.

2899
01:45:02.091 --> 01:45:04.375
MATT: So what, you're trying to pull it away from Fjord?

2900
01:45:04.375 --> 01:45:06.423
ASHLEY: I'm trying to put it on its back.

2901
01:45:06.423 --> 01:45:07.923
LAURA: Can she pull it towards me

2902
01:45:07.923 --> 01:45:12.090
and then I can use my action to help push it over?

2903
01:45:14.113 --> 01:45:15.404
MATT: She can pull it back and then you can take your action

2904
01:45:15.404 --> 01:45:17.495
but it would just be <i>you</i> doing it.

2905
01:45:17.495 --> 01:45:19.231
So either she's doing it, or you're doing it.

2906
01:45:19.231 --> 01:45:20.064
ASHLEY: Oh, my action would be pulling.

2907
01:45:20.064 --> 01:45:20.897
MATT: Yeah.

2908
01:45:22.522 --> 01:45:24.677
You are raging so you still have advantage

2909
01:45:24.677 --> 01:45:25.712
on your strength checks, so.

2910
01:45:25.712 --> 01:45:26.545
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

2911
01:45:26.545 --> 01:45:27.502
ASHLEY: Let me try.

2912
01:45:27.502 --> 01:45:28.622
MATT: You want to try and push it onto its back?

2913
01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.414
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to push it onto its back.

2914
01:45:30.414 --> 01:45:33.331
Okay, that was, 19.

2915
01:45:34.507 --> 01:45:35.555
We'll go with 19.

2916
01:45:35.555 --> 01:45:36.856
MATT: 19.

2917
01:45:36.856 --> 01:45:38.523
Let's see if it can...

2918
01:45:41.759 --> 01:45:42.990
20, it's 16 plus four.

2919
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:44.348
ASHLEY: Fuck!

2920
01:45:44.348 --> 01:45:47.115
MATT: You try and lift and lift and it kicks its tortoise

2921
01:45:47.115 --> 01:45:48.414
leg out the back and it manages to,

2922
01:45:48.414 --> 01:45:50.654
you lose your grip, and it (crunching)--

2923
01:45:50.654 --> 01:45:51.487
TALIESIN: It's going to work, though.

2924
01:45:51.487 --> 01:45:53.320
TRAVIS: J, come on, kill it!

2925
01:45:54.354 --> 01:45:56.782
ASHLEY: Ah, okay, well.

2926
01:45:56.782 --> 01:45:57.683
MATT: That's your action.

2927
01:45:57.683 --> 01:46:00.183
ASHLEY: That's my action and then...

2928
01:46:02.192 --> 01:46:03.273
I'm going to spit on it.

2929
01:46:03.273 --> 01:46:04.106
MATT: All right.

2930
01:46:06.107 --> 01:46:08.569
It lands on it, a little bit of Yasha spittle.

2931
01:46:08.569 --> 01:46:10.001
Jester, you still have your action.

2932
01:46:10.001 --> 01:46:13.489
LAURA: I guess, for my action I'm going to...

2933
01:46:13.489 --> 01:46:14.831
who knows what the fuck.

2934
01:46:14.831 --> 01:46:17.460
(laughter)

2935
01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:20.086
SAM: Tortoises are the new doors.

2936
01:46:20.086 --> 01:46:24.791
LAURA: I'm going to cast Bless on Fjord.

2937
01:46:24.791 --> 01:46:25.980
TRAVIS: (yelps)

2938
01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:26.999
MATT: All righty.

2939
01:46:26.999 --> 01:46:28.899
LAURA: Oh, I should have done this before

2940
01:46:28.899 --> 01:46:30.679
and then you could have--whatever.

2941
01:46:30.679 --> 01:46:31.809
ASHLEY: It doesn't matter.

2942
01:46:31.809 --> 01:46:32.660
LAURA: On Fjord.

2943
01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:33.540
MATT: Too late now.

2944
01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:35.207
LAURA: On Beau!

2945
01:46:37.679 --> 01:46:39.060
On Caduceus!

2946
01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:40.039
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.

2947
01:46:40.039 --> 01:46:41.289
MATT: There you go.

2948
01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.639
And that's your turn?

2949
01:46:45.639 --> 01:46:46.876
LAURA: Yeah.

2950
01:46:46.876 --> 01:46:48.569
TRAVIS: What does that do?

2951
01:46:48.569 --> 01:46:50.360
TALIESIN: Add a d4 to attacks and saves.

2952
01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.193
MATT: It's the tortoise's turn now.

2953
01:46:51.193 --> 01:46:52.528
TRAVIS: No.

2954
01:46:52.528 --> 01:46:53.679
LAURA: On attacks and saves.

2955
01:46:53.679 --> 01:46:55.058
TRAVIS: No!

2956
01:46:55.058 --> 01:46:57.890
MATT: It's going to attempt to swipe at you again

2957
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:59.105
with this giants pincer mouth.

2958
01:46:59.105 --> 01:47:00.807
SAM: I'm trying to give him half cover.

2959
01:47:00.807 --> 01:47:02.358
MATT: No.

2960
01:47:02.358 --> 01:47:03.485
TRAVIS: Like a little goblin Kevlar vest.

2961
01:47:03.485 --> 01:47:05.378
(laughter)

2962
01:47:05.378 --> 01:47:08.597
SAM: Yeah, I'm just protecting the heart and the abdomen.

2963
01:47:08.597 --> 01:47:09.887
TRAVIS: Take her!

2964
01:47:09.887 --> 01:47:11.944
LIAM: Nott is just a workout tank.

2965
01:47:11.944 --> 01:47:13.672
MARISHA: (amused) "Take her."

2966
01:47:13.672 --> 01:47:15.138
MATT: 18 to hit?

2967
01:47:15.138 --> 01:47:16.389
TRAVIS: (pained) That hits.

2968
01:47:16.389 --> 01:47:17.949
Oh wait--yeah, that does in fact.

2969
01:47:17.949 --> 01:47:19.366
SAM: Oh no, Armor of--

2970
01:47:20.658 --> 01:47:21.938
LAURA: Oh no, is that going to damage you?

2971
01:47:21.938 --> 01:47:22.909
MATT: You take--

2972
01:47:22.909 --> 01:47:23.818
SAM: No, it's going to damage the turtle.

2973
01:47:23.818 --> 01:47:25.630
LAURA: Yeah, I know, I know.

2974
01:47:25.630 --> 01:47:26.811
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, here we go.

2975
01:47:26.811 --> 01:47:28.111
MATT: 20 points of slashing damage.

2976
01:47:28.111 --> 01:47:28.944
TRAVIS: How many?

2977
01:47:28.944 --> 01:47:30.802
MATT: 20.
SAM: Jesus!

2978
01:47:30.802 --> 01:47:31.842
TALIESIN: Are you still standing?

2979
01:47:31.842 --> 01:47:32.675
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2980
01:47:32.675 --> 01:47:33.508
SAM: This thing is more powerful than any of us.

2981
01:47:33.508 --> 01:47:36.160
MATT: Bites into you and it takes 25 points

2982
01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.502
of cold damage from the Armor of Agathys.

2983
01:47:38.502 --> 01:47:41.112
TALIESIN: Is that technically double?

2984
01:47:41.112 --> 01:47:41.945
MATT: Because it was--

2985
01:47:41.945 --> 01:47:43.280
It is.

2986
01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.840
It takes--

2987
01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.171
Well, was it from an attack?

2988
01:47:46.171 --> 01:47:47.982
TALIESIN: It's an attack, technically.

2989
01:47:47.982 --> 01:47:49.102
MATT: Yeah, it would not effect it,

2990
01:47:49.102 --> 01:47:49.992
because it's not an attack.

2991
01:47:49.992 --> 01:47:52.075
TALIESIN: I think it's an attack.

2992
01:47:53.082 --> 01:47:55.061
MATT: It takes 25 points.

2993
01:47:55.061 --> 01:47:57.691
LAURA: How many hit points does a turtle have?

2994
01:47:57.691 --> 01:47:58.630
TALIESIN: Yeah, with an attack.

2995
01:47:58.630 --> 01:48:00.131
SAM: Is it a giant?

2996
01:48:00.131 --> 01:48:02.440
MATT: and LAURA: It's a giant turtle.

2997
01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:05.428
SAM: No but is that enough to get out of its form?

2998
01:48:05.428 --> 01:48:06.261
MATT: No.

2999
01:48:06.261 --> 01:48:07.094
SAM: Oh.

3000
01:48:07.094 --> 01:48:08.331
MATT: It has more hit points than that, as a giant tortoise.

3001
01:48:08.331 --> 01:48:10.030
(groaning)

3002
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:12.667
TRAVIS: What did we do?

3003
01:48:12.667 --> 01:48:14.251
Let's get the fuck out of here.

3004
01:48:14.251 --> 01:48:15.571
SAM: We made it harder to kill.

3005
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:17.981
(laughter)

3006
01:48:17.981 --> 01:48:18.814
TRAVIS: (shrieks) No!

3007
01:48:18.814 --> 01:48:19.647
MATT: It bites through the ice,

3008
01:48:19.647 --> 01:48:20.659
(splashing) blasts into its face,

3009
01:48:20.659 --> 01:48:23.879
and slams into you again

3010
01:48:23.879 --> 01:48:25.181
and pushes you into the wall.

3011
01:48:25.181 --> 01:48:26.014
(laughter)

3012
01:48:26.014 --> 01:48:27.681
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

3013
01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.503
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull a little bit

3014
01:48:31.503 --> 01:48:34.461
around this insanity.

3015
01:48:34.461 --> 01:48:35.501
MATT: Little bit around this way?

3016
01:48:35.501 --> 01:48:37.479
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a little, hugging the wall.

3017
01:48:37.479 --> 01:48:40.359
I am going to keep an eye on that fucking rift,

3018
01:48:40.359 --> 01:48:42.209
and if anything starts coming through,

3019
01:48:42.209 --> 01:48:46.629
I'm going to immediately fire a Sacred Flame at that,

3020
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:47.930
at anything that comes through,

3021
01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:50.426
and I'm also saying, I'm just saying,

3022
01:48:50.426 --> 01:48:53.629
if anybody's got an idea to close this thing, I am all ears.

3023
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:54.462
MATT: Caleb.

3024
01:48:54.462 --> 01:48:55.499
LIAM: I'm in a huff.

3025
01:48:55.499 --> 01:48:56.650
Reach into my component pouch

3026
01:48:56.650 --> 01:48:58.341
and I pull out the cocoon again

3027
01:48:58.341 --> 01:49:00.367
and I say, <i>Scheisse. Fick dich.</i>

3028
01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:04.065
and I cast Polymorph again, on the tortoise.

3029
01:49:04.065 --> 01:49:05.610
MATT: Okay.

3030
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:06.443
To turn it into?

3031
01:49:06.443 --> 01:49:09.141
LIAM: Well let's see if it succeeds first.

3032
01:49:09.141 --> 01:49:09.974
17.

3033
01:49:17.349 --> 01:49:18.182
MATT: 14.

3034
01:49:18.182 --> 01:49:19.546
LIAM: It's a regular fucking turtle.

3035
01:49:19.546 --> 01:49:24.530
(laughter)

3036
01:49:32.412 --> 01:49:34.199
SAM: Devolution.

3037
01:49:34.199 --> 01:49:37.979
TALIESIN: Want to throw it back into the rift?

3038
01:49:37.979 --> 01:49:39.530
SAM: We could chuck it into the rift!

3039
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:41.420
LAURA: Oh, yeah, good call!

3040
01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:42.490
SAM: That's a great call.

3041
01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:45.711
LIAM: Or we could put it under a cardboard box!

3042
01:49:45.711 --> 01:49:46.544
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

3043
01:49:46.544 --> 01:49:47.929
MARISHA: No, let's just chuck it into the rift.

3044
01:49:47.929 --> 01:49:49.799
TALIESIN: Maybe it'll be easier to close the rift

3045
01:49:49.799 --> 01:49:54.679
if there's nothing on this side, I don't know, I'm grasping.

3046
01:49:54.679 --> 01:49:56.599
MATT: Now there's this little turtle on the ground

3047
01:49:56.599 --> 01:49:59.274
that's going towards Fjord,

3048
01:50:02.202 --> 01:50:05.541
and he's doing like a little turtle shell bump

3049
01:50:05.541 --> 01:50:06.391
into your shin.

3050
01:50:06.391 --> 01:50:07.781
(laughter)

3051
01:50:07.781 --> 01:50:09.901
MATT: It's still focused.

3052
01:50:09.901 --> 01:50:11.020
ASHLEY: That's so cute.

3053
01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:11.853
TRAVIS: Fuck you!

3054
01:50:11.853 --> 01:50:13.469
LAURA: That's adorable.

3055
01:50:13.469 --> 01:50:15.479
SAM: What do we do, what do we do, what do we do?

3056
01:50:15.479 --> 01:50:16.797
Should we take care of the giant turtle thing?

3057
01:50:16.797 --> 01:50:18.463
ASHLEY: I feel like maybe we should throw it into the rift.

3058
01:50:18.463 --> 01:50:19.296
TALIESIN: Throw it into the rift.

3059
01:50:19.296 --> 01:50:21.046
SAM: Who's a good aimer?

3060
01:50:22.007 --> 01:50:22.840
TRAVIS: What?

3061
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.673
SAM: Thrower?

3062
01:50:23.673 --> 01:50:27.275
MARISHA: If I use it like my throwing stars, can I do that?

3063
01:50:27.275 --> 01:50:29.197
Can I fucking shot put it?

3064
01:50:29.197 --> 01:50:30.186
SAM: Oh Mage Hand!

3065
01:50:30.186 --> 01:50:32.479
LAURA: Yeah, Mage Hand it up.

3066
01:50:32.479 --> 01:50:34.506
SAM: I will cast Mage Hand.

3067
01:50:34.506 --> 01:50:36.375
MATT: Everyone else holds. It comes back to Nott's turn.

3068
01:50:36.375 --> 01:50:39.935
Nott, you're going to Mage Hand, goes over and grabs it

3069
01:50:39.935 --> 01:50:41.484
and lifts it up and you chuck it into the rift.

3070
01:50:41.484 --> 01:50:42.317
SAM: Yes.

3071
01:50:42.317 --> 01:50:43.150
MATT: Okay.

3072
01:50:43.150 --> 01:50:47.847
You watch as the turtle (whooshing).

3073
01:50:47.847 --> 01:50:49.495
Just like Poltergeist style,

3074
01:50:49.495 --> 01:50:51.167
just poof and vanishes into the air.

3075
01:50:51.167 --> 01:50:52.634
LAURA: I hold up a sign that has an eight on it.

3076
01:50:52.634 --> 01:50:53.763
(laughter)

3077
01:50:53.763 --> 01:50:55.183
TALIESIN: Where are you getting all those signs?

3078
01:50:55.183 --> 01:50:57.394
(laughter)

3079
01:50:57.394 --> 01:50:58.615
TALIESIN: Can we seal this?

3080
01:50:58.615 --> 01:50:59.783
SAM: Okay, do we seal this room?

3081
01:50:59.783 --> 01:51:00.616
The point of this whole thing

3082
01:51:00.616 --> 01:51:05.244
was to rid their home of bad things.

3083
01:51:05.244 --> 01:51:06.077
We can't do that.

3084
01:51:06.077 --> 01:51:06.910
LAURA: I have an idea.

3085
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:07.786
Caleb!

3086
01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:10.375
What if you make your dome thing

3087
01:51:10.375 --> 01:51:12.884
and you put it on the stairwell

3088
01:51:12.884 --> 01:51:16.815
and then it blocks anything from coming down the stairs,

3089
01:51:16.815 --> 01:51:19.895
and then we can close the rift as soon as the morning comes.

3090
01:51:19.895 --> 01:51:21.226
LIAM: That is an excellent idea.

3091
01:51:21.226 --> 01:51:23.476
Let me first take a...

3092
01:51:24.895 --> 01:51:25.728
TRAVIS: Does it keep things out

3093
01:51:25.728 --> 01:51:27.226
or does it also keep things in?

3094
01:51:27.226 --> 01:51:28.724
LAURA: It keeps things out.

3095
01:51:28.724 --> 01:51:29.954
TRAVIS: You couldn't put it around the rift?

3096
01:51:29.954 --> 01:51:30.787
LAURA: No.

3097
01:51:31.912 --> 01:51:32.745
TALIESIN: It's a shame we don't have--

3098
01:51:32.745 --> 01:51:34.674
LAURA: You could put it right up against the rift,

3099
01:51:34.674 --> 01:51:36.242
potentially, right?

3100
01:51:36.242 --> 01:51:37.842
SAM: We need to build a platform.

3101
01:51:37.842 --> 01:51:42.180
LIAM: It does not go--it only goes round side up.

3102
01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:45.231
LAURA: Yeah, right over the entrance for the stairs,

3103
01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:47.020
maybe, then.

3104
01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:48.522
LIAM: That's an excellent idea.

3105
01:51:48.522 --> 01:51:49.355
SAM: It is.

3106
01:51:49.355 --> 01:51:51.021
TALIESIN: Oh.

3107
01:51:51.021 --> 01:51:52.400
LAURA: Thank you.

3108
01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.452
SAM: Would that work, Matthew?

3109
01:51:54.452 --> 01:51:56.140
MATT: What are you trying?

3110
01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:59.950
SAM: To cover the entire span of the stairway opening with--

3111
01:51:59.950 --> 01:52:02.060
LIAM: With Leomund's Hut.

3112
01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:04.362
ASHLEY: Do we know what time it is?

3113
01:52:04.362 --> 01:52:06.041
LIAM: Caleb does.

3114
01:52:06.041 --> 01:52:09.616
MATT: Yes, at this time it would be, probably--

3115
01:52:09.616 --> 01:52:14.332
let's see, because you guys rested for the night,

3116
01:52:14.332 --> 01:52:15.818
left first thing in the morning, traveled here,

3117
01:52:15.818 --> 01:52:16.651
took most of the day,

3118
01:52:16.651 --> 01:52:21.298
it's probably, I'm going to say, pushing afternoon.

3119
01:52:21.298 --> 01:52:22.909
TALIESIN: I'm also going to point out that most of these

3120
01:52:22.909 --> 01:52:24.989
things can probably teleport and go through walls

3121
01:52:24.989 --> 01:52:25.988
so putting something there--

3122
01:52:25.988 --> 01:52:27.746
LAURA: Well the jellyfish can, but

3123
01:52:27.746 --> 01:52:30.248
maybe not the mosquito people.

3124
01:52:30.248 --> 01:52:32.915
TALIESIN: Maybe not the mosquito people.

3125
01:52:34.373 --> 01:52:36.067
MATT: What are you guys doing?

3126
01:52:36.067 --> 01:52:37.050
TALIESIN: We are tapped.

3127
01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:39.389
LIAM: Well I yank the book out and start ritual casting

3128
01:52:39.389 --> 01:52:40.690
Leomund's Tiny Hut.

3129
01:52:40.690 --> 01:52:43.210
LAURA: We all get down the stairs below it.

3130
01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:44.650
MATT: You all go down the stairs below?

3131
01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:46.261
Soorna goes and takes the leather

3132
01:52:46.261 --> 01:52:47.707
that has been scattered and refolds it

3133
01:52:47.707 --> 01:52:49.101
and places it ritualistically

3134
01:52:49.101 --> 01:52:52.279
on the center piece of the raised platform

3135
01:52:52.279 --> 01:52:55.770
and then solemnly looks to the rest of you.

3136
01:52:55.770 --> 01:52:58.304
Says to you in giant, "What are we doing?"

3137
01:52:58.304 --> 01:53:00.837
TALIESIN: We don't have--we're too weak

3138
01:53:00.837 --> 01:53:02.245
to close the rift right now,

3139
01:53:02.245 --> 01:53:07.187
so we're thinking we may sleep and try again in the morning.

3140
01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:10.730
Or at least sleep for an hour or two,

3141
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:13.280
as many hours as we need to--

3142
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:15.113
LAURA: Eight, I need eight.

3143
01:53:16.359 --> 01:53:17.933
TALIESIN: Unless somebody's got a better idea.

3144
01:53:17.933 --> 01:53:20.178
I don't know what else to do with this thing.

3145
01:53:20.178 --> 01:53:21.011
MATT: "All right."

3146
01:53:21.949 --> 01:53:24.490
LAURA: Were you here when it--was she here when it opened?

3147
01:53:24.490 --> 01:53:25.948
TALIESIN: Were you here?

3148
01:53:25.948 --> 01:53:30.281
MATT: "I don't know. I fled when we began to be attacked.

3149
01:53:32.929 --> 01:53:36.268
"The buzzing began to come from the bone pit

3150
01:53:36.268 --> 01:53:39.759
"and we began to run and that's when they began to attack.

3151
01:53:39.759 --> 01:53:41.210
"I was not here for this rift."

3152
01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:42.760
TALIESIN: Buzzing began, came from the bone pit?

3153
01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:43.818
TRAVIS: Is there another rift down there?

3154
01:53:43.818 --> 01:53:44.978
TALIESIN: There might be.

3155
01:53:44.978 --> 01:53:47.189
ASHLEY: What was the bone pit for?

3156
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:48.560
MATT: You closed one.

3157
01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.879
LAURA: Yeah, we closed one in there.

3158
01:53:49.879 --> 01:53:51.670
TRAVIS: Oh.

3159
01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:56.066
TALIESIN: I would say, let's--do you feel that this plan,

3160
01:53:56.066 --> 01:53:58.098
do you feel all right waiting until morning,

3161
01:53:58.098 --> 01:54:02.040
or at least waiting for a few hours and letting us--

3162
01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:03.509
LAURA: Regenerate ourselves.

3163
01:54:03.509 --> 01:54:04.737
Translate that.

3164
01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:06.719
TALIESIN: Yeah, and regain our power,

3165
01:54:06.719 --> 01:54:08.998
and perhaps look around to make sure

3166
01:54:08.998 --> 01:54:10.178
that there's nothing else.

3167
01:54:10.178 --> 01:54:12.589
MATT: "Of course, of course."

3168
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:15.320
And Soorna steps down the stairs with you guys below

3169
01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.368
as you're preparing your ritual.

3170
01:54:17.368 --> 01:54:19.864
You can see Soorna looks

3171
01:54:19.864 --> 01:54:22.120
definitely confused by a lot of the things

3172
01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:25.770
that are transpired, especially the ones turtle related,

3173
01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:30.147
but there is a look of fear and worry in her eyes

3174
01:54:30.147 --> 01:54:33.629
that we've come this far and she doesn't seem sold

3175
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:35.959
that you're purely confident of what you're doing

3176
01:54:35.959 --> 01:54:37.909
but is going along with it.

3177
01:54:37.909 --> 01:54:39.628
You're finishing your ritual,

3178
01:54:39.628 --> 01:54:41.798
fully extending out to cross the entrance.

3179
01:54:41.798 --> 01:54:44.881
LIAM: Well it, you know, it's ten foot...

3180
01:54:49.168 --> 01:54:51.406
Ten-foot radius--yeah, it would do it.

3181
01:54:51.406 --> 01:54:53.037
MATT: Ten foot radius would close up the entire top.

3182
01:54:53.037 --> 01:54:53.870
LAURA: Sweet.

3183
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:55.557
TALIESIN: Can we have Frumpkin up here

3184
01:54:55.557 --> 01:54:56.978
maybe keeping an eye on things?

3185
01:54:56.978 --> 01:54:59.418
LIAM: Absolutely, yeah, he can sit right on top of the dome.

3186
01:54:59.418 --> 01:55:00.778
TALIESIN: I'm also going to run Detect Magic

3187
01:55:00.778 --> 01:55:03.778
and do a walk around the place to look around.

3188
01:55:03.778 --> 01:55:05.077
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say those other wings,

3189
01:55:05.077 --> 01:55:06.797
just give it a look around.

3190
01:55:06.797 --> 01:55:09.277
TALIESIN: And some, check for undead.

3191
01:55:09.277 --> 01:55:10.248
TRAVIS: Investigation.

3192
01:55:10.248 --> 01:55:11.715
TALIESIN: I've got a couple detect undead--

3193
01:55:11.715 --> 01:55:13.275
SAM: Investiga-sh.

3194
01:55:13.275 --> 01:55:15.426
TALIESIN: I think by now your spell is probably--

3195
01:55:15.426 --> 01:55:19.088
MATT: Okay, so you cast Detect Magic,

3196
01:55:19.088 --> 01:55:20.744
and where are you going?

3197
01:55:20.744 --> 01:55:23.516
TALIESIN: I'm checking this room and then I'm walking down

3198
01:55:23.516 --> 01:55:26.378
and taking a little--

3199
01:55:26.378 --> 01:55:27.586
TRAVIS: The upper meditation room.

3200
01:55:27.586 --> 01:55:30.426
MATT: The radius on that is 60 feet, 30 feet, what is it?

3201
01:55:30.426 --> 01:55:31.259
TALIESIN: That's a good question.

3202
01:55:31.259 --> 01:55:32.592
Hold on, I'll go looking for that.

3203
01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:33.888
MATT: While you're doing that, what's anybody else doing?

3204
01:55:33.888 --> 01:55:35.346
TRAVIS: Investigating the wings down here

3205
01:55:35.346 --> 01:55:36.317
that we haven't been into.

3206
01:55:36.317 --> 01:55:39.059
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll help Fjord with that.

3207
01:55:39.059 --> 01:55:40.317
Check out the other side.

3208
01:55:40.317 --> 01:55:42.125
MATT: Investigation check with advantage

3209
01:55:42.125 --> 01:55:43.794
because you're helping.

3210
01:55:43.794 --> 01:55:46.503
Unless you guys want to roll independently. Up to you.

3211
01:55:46.503 --> 01:55:47.336
ASHLEY: Go for it.

3212
01:55:50.033 --> 01:55:51.317
TRAVIS: 19.

3213
01:55:51.317 --> 01:55:52.567
MATT: 19, okay.

3214
01:55:55.906 --> 01:56:00.106
You, upon stepping down into these chambers below,

3215
01:56:00.106 --> 01:56:01.904
I'll move you guys off and into this area

3216
01:56:01.904 --> 01:56:03.957
since that's where you're all moving,

3217
01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:08.448
your holy weapon has faded, your gloves,

3218
01:56:08.448 --> 01:56:12.736
your fists of doom are no longer channeling the doom

3219
01:56:12.736 --> 01:56:14.986
from earlier, and Soorna has also come down

3220
01:56:14.986 --> 01:56:16.230
and joined you all.

3221
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:17.179
LIAM: Doomfist.

3222
01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:18.954
MATT: I'll move this aside here.

3223
01:56:18.954 --> 01:56:20.986
TALIESIN: I did a little, I started my thing in there,

3224
01:56:20.986 --> 01:56:22.935
but that would've only taken two seconds.

3225
01:56:22.935 --> 01:56:25.776
MATT: Right, so.

3226
01:56:25.776 --> 01:56:27.557
Yasha and Fjord begin

3227
01:56:27.557 --> 01:56:30.637
going through the various sleeping arrangements here.

3228
01:56:30.637 --> 01:56:33.768
You find that there are little alcoves

3229
01:56:33.768 --> 01:56:36.197
that are chipped away at the base of these

3230
01:56:36.197 --> 01:56:39.448
and hidden beneath the elements of bedding and cloth,

3231
01:56:39.448 --> 01:56:41.906
little pockets where things are hidden,

3232
01:56:41.906 --> 01:56:43.746
collections, baubles,

3233
01:56:43.746 --> 01:56:48.329
seemingly belonging to those who lived here previously.

3234
01:56:52.914 --> 01:56:54.641
Natural one.

3235
01:56:54.641 --> 01:56:55.474
LAURA: Sweet.

3236
01:56:55.474 --> 01:56:59.608
MATT: Soorna does not notice you rummaging through

3237
01:56:59.608 --> 01:57:01.536
the alcoves of her brethren,

3238
01:57:01.536 --> 01:57:03.706
is currently focused instead on,

3239
01:57:03.706 --> 01:57:05.676
looking in the direction of where you are,

3240
01:57:05.676 --> 01:57:06.797
finishing up your ritual

3241
01:57:06.797 --> 01:57:09.906
and seems to be generally tense.

3242
01:57:09.906 --> 01:57:14.477
This massive, you know, long-limbed,

3243
01:57:14.477 --> 01:57:16.253
elegant stone giant,

3244
01:57:16.253 --> 01:57:19.564
distracted by the chaos that has happened.

3245
01:57:19.564 --> 01:57:22.426
You go through those and you can see there's collections

3246
01:57:22.426 --> 01:57:27.360
of coins, little art pieces, some rough gems.

3247
01:57:29.557 --> 01:57:31.705
Do you take them?

3248
01:57:31.705 --> 01:57:33.928
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so.

3249
01:57:33.928 --> 01:57:37.266
MATT: Okay. There is one of them you do find that has

3250
01:57:37.266 --> 01:57:40.333
a five foot-wide leather mask.

3251
01:57:41.248 --> 01:57:42.081
SAM: What?

3252
01:57:42.917 --> 01:57:45.928
MATT: Sections cut out for the eyes

3253
01:57:45.928 --> 01:57:46.968
and the rest of it is

3254
01:57:46.968 --> 01:57:48.984
this like solid patchwork leather.

3255
01:57:48.984 --> 01:57:50.333
Along the outside of the eyes

3256
01:57:50.333 --> 01:57:52.277
and along the front of the face,

3257
01:57:52.277 --> 01:57:56.996
and a singular line around the eyes,

3258
01:57:56.996 --> 01:58:00.557
there are rough stones, like precious stones,

3259
01:58:00.557 --> 01:58:02.608
that are pressed into the leather.

3260
01:58:02.608 --> 01:58:04.717
It look ceremonial.

3261
01:58:04.717 --> 01:58:06.683
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3262
01:58:06.683 --> 01:58:09.255
It looks like it would fit on a giant's face, right?

3263
01:58:09.255 --> 01:58:10.088
MATT: Yes.

3264
01:58:11.463 --> 01:58:13.768
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it, I'll grab it

3265
01:58:13.768 --> 01:58:16.586
and walk it over to her and say:

3266
01:58:16.586 --> 01:58:20.637
Hey Soorna, what is this for?

3267
01:58:20.637 --> 01:58:25.156
MATT: Soorna walks over and takes it from you, gingerly.

3268
01:58:25.156 --> 01:58:27.208
"This is for my meditations.

3269
01:58:27.208 --> 01:58:32.208
"It helps me to look beyond the dreams."

3270
01:58:32.406 --> 01:58:36.106
Takes it and looks at it, solemnly,

3271
01:58:36.106 --> 01:58:37.415
and I take it you're translating for Fjord?

3272
01:58:37.415 --> 01:58:38.248
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

3273
01:58:38.248 --> 01:58:41.266
Also, does this thing have a magical essence?

3274
01:58:41.266 --> 01:58:43.288
MATT: This mask does not have a magical essence.

3275
01:58:43.288 --> 01:58:44.121
TALIESIN: No, okay.

3276
01:58:44.121 --> 01:58:45.886
MATT: It seems to be purely for ceremonial purposes.

3277
01:58:45.886 --> 01:58:50.256
TALIESIN: It's not, yeah, it's not making anything buzz.

3278
01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:52.637
I do my walk around, though.

3279
01:58:52.637 --> 01:58:53.470
MATT: What was the radius?

3280
01:58:53.470 --> 01:58:56.688
TALIESIN: 30 feet. Yeah, I have ten minutes

3281
01:58:56.688 --> 01:58:58.679
for anything within 30 feet is going to ping

3282
01:58:58.679 --> 01:59:01.109
and I've also got a few undead pings just in case.

3283
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:02.749
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for jellyfish

3284
01:59:02.749 --> 01:59:04.949
that are floating around that may be down here.

3285
01:59:04.949 --> 01:59:06.325
TALIESIN: And any bodies.

3286
01:59:06.325 --> 01:59:09.725
Anything that can be used.

3287
01:59:09.725 --> 01:59:11.519
Travis: When you meditate with your mask,

3288
01:59:11.519 --> 01:59:13.775
what is it you focus on?

3289
01:59:13.775 --> 01:59:17.692
does it help you lock in on something specific?

3290
01:59:19.686 --> 01:59:22.655
Matt: Soorna looks towards you and goes,

3291
01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:27.081
"if you help me save this place, maybe I'll tell you."

3292
01:59:27.081 --> 01:59:28.855
TRAVIS: That's very fair of you.

3293
01:59:28.855 --> 01:59:29.688
MATT: Goes and takes the mask

3294
01:59:29.688 --> 01:59:33.985
and places it back in the hidden chamber in her bedside.

3295
01:59:33.985 --> 01:59:34.818
TRAVIS: Yep.

3296
01:59:35.818 --> 01:59:37.414
MATT: Beau, you're keeping eyes out as well.

3297
01:59:37.414 --> 01:59:40.184
Caleb, you finish your hut above you,

3298
01:59:40.184 --> 01:59:41.265
blocking off that space,

3299
01:59:41.265 --> 01:59:42.098
but you have to stay inside it.

3300
01:59:42.098 --> 01:59:43.897
LIAM: Yeah, correct, I'm parked in this.

3301
01:59:43.897 --> 01:59:46.627
TALIESIN: Fjord, you should stay in there, too.

3302
01:59:46.627 --> 01:59:47.460
TRAVIS: Stay in where?

3303
01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:48.325
TALIESIN: In the bubble.

3304
01:59:48.325 --> 01:59:49.413
You should be out of the--

3305
01:59:49.413 --> 01:59:50.744
MATT: So Fjord you're staying with Caleb?

3306
01:59:50.744 --> 01:59:51.577
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

3307
01:59:51.577 --> 01:59:52.410
TALIESIN: Yeah, Mr. Fjord, you should not.

3308
01:59:52.410 --> 01:59:54.165
MATT: Anybody else resting anywhere?

3309
01:59:54.165 --> 01:59:55.748
TALIESIN: As soon as--

3310
01:59:55.748 --> 01:59:58.897
ASHLEY: I'm going to rest right beneath the bubble

3311
01:59:58.897 --> 02:00:00.773
to keep an eye on them.

3312
02:00:00.773 --> 02:00:01.824
MARISHA: I'll go to the bubble.

3313
02:00:01.824 --> 02:00:02.885
TALIESIN: I think we should all be in the bubble.

3314
02:00:02.885 --> 02:00:04.450
MARISHA: Let's go in the bubble.

3315
02:00:04.450 --> 02:00:06.725
LIAM: The bubble is not a complete bubble,

3316
02:00:06.725 --> 02:00:07.925
it is only a dome,

3317
02:00:07.925 --> 02:00:10.205
so if there is any danger from the outside,

3318
02:00:10.205 --> 02:00:12.005
we are not protected from it, below.

3319
02:00:12.005 --> 02:00:12.838
MATT: Correct.

3320
02:00:12.838 --> 02:00:14.853
LIAM: I will also have Frumpkin sit in the room,

3321
02:00:14.853 --> 02:00:17.074
the chamber above, and speak to me

3322
02:00:17.074 --> 02:00:19.481
if he sees anything amiss.

3323
02:00:19.481 --> 02:00:21.314
If he does, I will then look through his eyes,

3324
02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:22.634
but not until.

3325
02:00:22.634 --> 02:00:23.583
TALIESIN: Taking some shifts?

3326
02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:24.773
MATT: How long does Daylight spell last?

3327
02:00:24.773 --> 02:00:27.705
TALIESIN: The light spell? That's a good question.

3328
02:00:27.705 --> 02:00:28.854
LIAM: Down here?

3329
02:00:28.854 --> 02:00:30.553
MATT: Well, no, it was cast in the chamber up there.

3330
02:00:30.553 --> 02:00:33.273
LIAM: Up top, well, that's the drift globe.

3331
02:00:33.273 --> 02:00:34.593
MATT: Oh, the drift globe, right.

3332
02:00:34.593 --> 02:00:36.374
LIAM: Which I would've taken by now.

3333
02:00:36.374 --> 02:00:37.814
MATT: Right, so there would be no light source in that--

3334
02:00:37.814 --> 02:00:39.715
TALIESIN: I have a Daylight spell.
MATT: But you cast it down here.

3335
02:00:39.715 --> 02:00:43.388
LIAM: Also, this is unlimited,

3336
02:00:43.388 --> 02:00:44.988
so I toss it through,

3337
02:00:44.988 --> 02:00:48.536
I say tawhaj again and toss it through the dome

3338
02:00:48.536 --> 02:00:50.846
and it floats five feet above the ground

3339
02:00:50.846 --> 02:00:53.006
down in this chamber below.

3340
02:00:53.006 --> 02:00:53.839
MATT: Right here?

3341
02:00:53.839 --> 02:00:55.137
LIAM: Yeah, lighting up this room.

3342
02:00:55.137 --> 02:00:56.655
MATT: Got it, cool.

3343
02:00:56.655 --> 02:00:58.286
Is everyone staying up here?

3344
02:00:58.286 --> 02:01:00.255
SAM: I'm stealthing away from the party.

3345
02:01:00.255 --> 02:01:01.937
MATT: Okay. Jester, where are you going?

3346
02:01:01.937 --> 02:01:03.756
LAURA: I'm going to be at the bottom step.

3347
02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:05.974
I'm going to lay down on the very bottom step.

3348
02:01:05.974 --> 02:01:07.669
MATT: You got it. Where you going?

3349
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:09.806
SAM: I'm going to go to the bone pit.

3350
02:01:09.806 --> 02:01:10.745
MATT: Okay.

3351
02:01:10.745 --> 02:01:14.294
Caduceus, you're going with-as you're doing your tour?

3352
02:01:14.294 --> 02:01:17.036
TALIESIN: My tour shouldn't last more than ten minutes

3353
02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:20.166
and then I'm joining everybody else.

3354
02:01:20.166 --> 02:01:21.854
I'm doing a general scan.

3355
02:01:21.854 --> 02:01:23.305
MATT: Right, well as you're doing your scan,

3356
02:01:23.305 --> 02:01:25.036
and everyone's getting over here,

3357
02:01:25.036 --> 02:01:26.265
are you going with Caduceus, then?

3358
02:01:26.265 --> 02:01:27.126
SAM: Is he going that way?

3359
02:01:27.126 --> 02:01:27.959
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3360
02:01:27.959 --> 02:01:29.766
SAM: Then yes, I will grab Caduceus and say:

3361
02:01:29.766 --> 02:01:31.492
Can you come with me for a second?

3362
02:01:31.492 --> 02:01:33.275
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: What are you doing?

3363
02:01:33.275 --> 02:01:37.145
SAM: Is there a way that you can make

3364
02:01:37.145 --> 02:01:40.275
that one at peace

3365
02:01:40.275 --> 02:01:45.275
a little bit, or like, get rid of the burn-y body?

3366
02:01:47.073 --> 02:01:50.004
MATT: There is the charred corpse of the goblin that was--

3367
02:01:50.004 --> 02:01:51.595
TALIESIN: I'm going to do my thing.

3368
02:01:51.595 --> 02:01:53.120
Yeah, I can do something.

3369
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.105
SAM: Thank you.

3370
02:01:54.105 --> 02:01:56.315
TALIESIN: Actually, this should be interesting.

3371
02:01:56.315 --> 02:01:57.833
I'm going to be curious what they think of this.

3372
02:01:57.833 --> 02:02:01.726
I'm going to cast my little thing on that whole pit.

3373
02:02:01.726 --> 02:02:03.875
MATT: Decompose? Okay.

3374
02:02:03.875 --> 02:02:05.534
TALIESIN: I want that to turn into a big,

3375
02:02:05.534 --> 02:02:07.345
irritating wildflower garden.

3376
02:02:07.345 --> 02:02:08.662
MATT: It'll take a long time for that to happen.

3377
02:02:08.662 --> 02:02:10.374
TALIESIN: Oh, I know but it's starting.

3378
02:02:10.374 --> 02:02:13.577
MATT: You cast Decompose

3379
02:02:13.577 --> 02:02:15.814
and you can see elements from the very charred corpse

3380
02:02:15.814 --> 02:02:17.852
of the goblin and the nearby bones

3381
02:02:17.852 --> 02:02:21.166
begin to gather elements of moss and fungus.

3382
02:02:21.166 --> 02:02:21.999
TALIESIN: In a few months,

3383
02:02:21.999 --> 02:02:23.282
it's going to be beautiful and unique.

3384
02:02:23.282 --> 02:02:26.625
MATT: It's at that moment that your Detect Magic,

3385
02:02:26.625 --> 02:02:29.115
picks up an essence in the pit.

3386
02:02:29.115 --> 02:02:30.086
TALIESIN: There's something in the pit.

3387
02:02:30.086 --> 02:02:32.544
(laughter)

3388
02:02:32.544 --> 02:02:34.393
What kind of thing?

3389
02:02:34.393 --> 02:02:35.926
TRAVIS: That is level ten excitement from Caduceus.

3390
02:02:35.926 --> 02:02:38.414
SAM: Are you detecting your own magic,

3391
02:02:38.414 --> 02:02:40.064
because you just cast magic down there?

3392
02:02:40.064 --> 02:02:41.945
TALIESIN: That's not how that works.

3393
02:02:41.945 --> 02:02:43.773
(laughter)

3394
02:02:43.773 --> 02:02:44.624
What kind of--

3395
02:02:44.624 --> 02:02:45.715
SAM: I'm jumping down!

3396
02:02:45.715 --> 02:02:47.185
LAURA: No!

3397
02:02:47.185 --> 02:02:48.934
MATT: You do get the kind of magic,

3398
02:02:48.934 --> 02:02:53.035
though I would say it would be conjuration.

3399
02:02:53.035 --> 02:02:55.493
SAM: I'm going down to check it out.

3400
02:02:55.493 --> 02:02:59.503
MATT: You leap down (thudding), make an investigation check.

3401
02:02:59.503 --> 02:03:00.901
SAM: Ten plus ten.

3402
02:03:00.901 --> 02:03:02.333
Ten plus 11, 21.

3403
02:03:02.333 --> 02:03:03.813
MATT: 21, okay.

3404
02:03:03.813 --> 02:03:04.802
You start rummaging through,

3405
02:03:04.802 --> 02:03:08.462
like the body of the goblin that you so carefully placed,

3406
02:03:08.462 --> 02:03:11.152
you chuck it aside and it scatters across the wall,

3407
02:03:11.152 --> 02:03:12.674
and you start digging through the bones,

3408
02:03:12.674 --> 02:03:15.882
going underneath, pulling through.

3409
02:03:15.882 --> 02:03:18.682
About two minutes of you pulling through,

3410
02:03:18.682 --> 02:03:21.531
eventually you see this faint light

3411
02:03:21.531 --> 02:03:22.981
and you pull across a few more bones

3412
02:03:22.981 --> 02:03:26.138
and you look down and you see

3413
02:03:26.138 --> 02:03:30.621
a silver disk-like object about that wide,

3414
02:03:30.621 --> 02:03:32.141
with a central orb inside--

3415
02:03:32.141 --> 02:03:33.200
SAM: We've seen this before!

3416
02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:36.530
MATT: With these four coiled crystals

3417
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:38.421
that are wedged in the sides of it.

3418
02:03:38.421 --> 02:03:39.871
TALIESIN: We should break it, right?

3419
02:03:39.871 --> 02:03:41.151
LAURA: I can't remember what they did.

3420
02:03:41.151 --> 02:03:42.282
TALIESIN: Yeah, we breaked it.

3421
02:03:42.282 --> 02:03:43.642
SAM: Okay, I'll bring it up.

3422
02:03:43.642 --> 02:03:46.322
That doesn't close the rift, though, right?

3423
02:03:46.322 --> 02:03:48.890
TALIESIN: I think it does, actually.

3424
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:49.951
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

3425
02:03:49.951 --> 02:03:51.350
TRAVIS: I remember they generate it.

3426
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:53.082
LIAM: I'm nowhere near it though, right?

3427
02:03:53.082 --> 02:03:53.991
MATT: No, for your cat.

3428
02:03:53.991 --> 02:03:55.461
LIAM: Oh for me, oh for my cat, got it.

3429
02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:57.461
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh no.

3430
02:04:00.252 --> 02:04:01.315
LIAM: 16.

3431
02:04:01.315 --> 02:04:02.148
MATT: 16?

3432
02:04:02.148 --> 02:04:03.315
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

3433
02:04:04.319 --> 02:04:06.152
That turtle jellyfish,

3434
02:04:07.709 --> 02:04:09.610
in the time that it's taken for you guys to come down here

3435
02:04:09.610 --> 02:04:11.799
and set up the ritual and do the passing

3436
02:04:11.799 --> 02:04:13.540
and searching over this tier,

3437
02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:16.090
this little jelly (poofing) emerges,

3438
02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:17.707
and Frumpkin sees it.

3439
02:04:17.707 --> 02:04:20.410
It vanishes from the chamber.

3440
02:04:20.410 --> 02:04:21.421
SAM: Oh no.

3441
02:04:21.421 --> 02:04:23.730
TALIESIN: I think we have to destroy this thing.

3442
02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:26.941
I'm going to tell you to come out, and bring it out,

3443
02:04:26.941 --> 02:04:27.774
and we're going to destroy it.

3444
02:04:27.774 --> 02:04:31.079
SAM: Here, let me throw it to Caleb,

3445
02:04:31.079 --> 02:04:34.061
he's terrible at Frisbee, he'll miss it, it'll break.

3446
02:04:34.061 --> 02:04:35.108
TALIESIN: Let's do it quick.

3447
02:04:35.108 --> 02:04:36.719
MATT: As you guys turn around the corner there,

3448
02:04:36.719 --> 02:04:39.130
you hear this scraping sound

3449
02:04:39.130 --> 02:04:40.959
and you glance to the left into the chamber

3450
02:04:40.959 --> 02:04:43.919
where the skeletal remains of that giant

3451
02:04:43.919 --> 02:04:48.621
that was being eaten when you first arrived are (crunching).

3452
02:04:48.621 --> 02:04:50.541
MARISHA: Oh the jelly went into that.

3453
02:04:50.541 --> 02:04:51.839
MATT: Stand up.

3454
02:04:51.839 --> 02:04:54.487
ASHLEY: Jelly!
SAM: Oh boy.

3455
02:04:54.487 --> 02:04:55.320
LIAM: Awesome.

3456
02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.153
MATT: We're going to go to break.

3457
02:04:56.153 --> 02:04:57.501
(groaning)

3458
02:04:57.501 --> 02:05:00.309
(laughter)

3459
02:05:00.309 --> 02:05:02.109
LAURA: Why couldn't I have rolled not a one?

3460
02:05:02.109 --> 02:05:02.942
MATT: I know!

3461
02:05:02.942 --> 02:05:03.999
TRAVIS: Baby, it's not your fault!

3462
02:05:03.999 --> 02:05:06.207
MATT: It happens, it's the name of the game.

3463
02:05:06.207 --> 02:05:08.457
SAM: It's your fault.

3464
02:05:08.457 --> 02:05:09.797
MATT: We'll be back here shortly

3465
02:05:09.797 --> 02:05:12.999
and see what this chaos is going to entail here.

3466
02:05:12.999 --> 02:05:15.738
We have our Wyrmwood giveaway before we take off.

3467
02:05:15.738 --> 02:05:20.458
Tonight's password is bedfellows, one word, bedfellows.

3468
02:05:20.458 --> 02:05:23.256
Put that into our Twitch chat once.

3469
02:05:23.256 --> 02:05:24.427
More than once and you'll be disqualified

3470
02:05:24.427 --> 02:05:26.527
and once again this for people in the US and Canada,

3471
02:05:26.527 --> 02:05:28.639
excluding Quebec because of stupid giveaway laws,

3472
02:05:28.639 --> 02:05:31.190
but we'll have our winner back here in a few minutes,

3473
02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:32.282

At 4:00pm at Twitch.tv, I don't want to pull a muscle.

DANI: Oh man, the hair like--

3547
02:10:02.553 --> 02:10:05.084
ASHLEY: That was a Crispin Glover slash.

3548
02:10:05.084 --> 02:10:06.764
DANI: That was the worst one.

3549
02:10:06.764 --> 02:10:09.514
BRIAN: Ash, the camera wasn't on you, do it again.

3550
02:10:09.514 --> 02:10:10.495
ASHLEY: Is that how you do it?

3551
02:10:10.495 --> 02:10:11.328
TALIESIN: I don't know.

3552
02:10:11.328 --> 02:10:12.175
BRIAN: Just say submit and then do that thing

3553
02:10:12.175 --> 02:10:13.083
that you just did.

3554
02:10:13.083 --> 02:10:13.916
ASHLEY: What did I do?

3555
02:10:13.916 --> 02:10:15.284
BRIAN: Just say submit and do the thing you just did.

3556
02:10:15.284 --> 02:10:16.295
ASHLEY: Did I do it, did I fix?

3557
02:10:16.295 --> 02:10:17.215
BRIAN: Yeah, do it to this camera. Say submit,

3558
02:10:17.215 --> 02:10:18.984
and then do the thing you just did.

3559
02:10:18.984 --> 02:10:19.817
ASHLEY: Submit.

3560
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:23.724

3561
02:10:23.724 --> 02:10:25.223
Is that how you do it?

3562
02:10:25.223 --> 02:10:26.306
TALIESIN: It is now.

3563
02:10:26.306 --> 02:10:30.284
That is all the time we have for tonight.

3564
02:10:30.284 --> 02:10:34.956
That is all I've ever wanted to see on this show.

3565
02:10:34.956 --> 02:10:37.956
Taliesin, do it with your hair.

3566
02:10:37.956 --> 02:10:41.504
Thank you, now look at the camera.

3567
02:10:41.504 --> 02:10:43.076
Now look at the camera.

3568
02:10:43.076 --> 02:10:45.146
DANI: No, that's not okay, that's not good.

3569

BRIAN: Ashley.
TALIESIN: Meep!

3570
02:10:47.812 --> 02:10:50.093
BRIAN: Did you have any steak last night, Max?

3571
02:10:50.093 --> 02:10:52.023
Guys, we can't see this unless we can--

3572
02:10:52.023 --> 02:10:55.466
unless New Greg can make some magic here.

3573
02:10:56.804 --> 02:10:59.835
Max, are you able to show the people your left hand

3574
02:10:59.835 --> 02:11:01.186
and your left hand only?

3575
02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:02.636
TALIESIN: What the?

3576
02:11:02.636 --> 02:11:04.469
BRIAN: Zach, are you awake?

3577
02:11:05.484 --> 02:11:07.466
Henry, go wake Zach up, please.

3578
02:11:07.466 --> 02:11:09.106
TALIESIN: They're working on it.
ASHLEY: There we go.

3579
02:11:09.106 --> 02:11:10.436
BRIANL Oh, Max.

3580
02:11:10.436 --> 02:11:11.935
DANI: Oh buddy.

3581
02:11:11.935 --> 02:11:13.106
BRIAN: Max, what happened?

3582
02:11:13.106 --> 02:11:15.266
(laughter)

3583
02:11:15.266 --> 02:11:17.826
DANI: A plus, Steve.

3584
02:11:17.826 --> 02:11:18.959
TALIESIN: Wow!

3585
02:11:18.959 --> 02:11:23.135
BRIAN: Max burned his hand making some steaks last night.

3586
02:11:23.135 --> 02:11:25.076
ASHLEY: Come on, bring it in.

3587
02:11:25.076 --> 02:11:25.909
(thudding)

3588
02:11:25.909 --> 02:11:28.394
BRIANL Are you out of your goddamn mind?

3589
02:11:28.394 --> 02:11:29.266
TALIESIN: Down, boy.

3590
02:11:29.266 --> 02:11:32.433
BRIAN: You threw that so fucking hard.

3591
02:11:33.527 --> 02:11:35.578
Maxwell James.

3592
02:11:35.578 --> 02:11:39.253
ASHLEY: He is short on hands right now.

3593
02:11:40.432 --> 02:11:41.390
Sports!

3594
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:42.656
TALIESIN: Sports.

3595
02:11:42.656 --> 02:11:45.698
BRIAN: This is a show about a D&amp;D game,

3596
02:11:45.698 --> 02:11:49.622
can we have some goddamn professionalism?!

3597
02:11:49.622 --> 02:11:50.767
ASHLEY: I want to try throwing it.

3598
02:11:50.767 --> 02:11:52.298
BRIAN: This is an important talk show.

3599
02:11:52.298 --> 02:11:53.131
TALIESIN: It's only fair

3600
02:11:53.131 --> 02:11:54.396
if everyone gets to throw the paper towels.

3601
02:11:54.396 --> 02:11:57.821
BRIAN: This format lends itself to professionalism!

3602
02:11:57.821 --> 02:12:00.520
Tired of people running in here with Nerf guns,

3603
02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:03.856
disrespecting my Fjord bust by throwing a fucking--

3604
02:12:04.993 --> 02:12:05.826
ASHLEY: Henry!

3605
02:12:07.307 --> 02:12:09.778
BRIANL I know you want to help, but it's all over, buddy.

3606
02:12:09.778 --> 02:12:11.676
TALIESIN: I'm so amused by all of this.

3607
02:12:11.676 --> 02:12:13.716
BRIAN: Talks Machina had a great run.

3608
02:12:13.716 --> 02:12:15.195
ASHLEY: What are you doing? This is my spot!

3609
02:12:15.195 --> 02:12:18.796
BRIAN: There's probably some highlights. Look at the screen.

3610
02:12:18.796 --> 02:12:23.796
There's probably some highlights on YouTube you can watch.

3611
02:12:24.438 --> 02:12:26.875
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I need a ton for the books.

3612
02:12:26.875 --> 02:12:28.898
ASHLEY: Yep, it's all coming apart.

3613
02:12:28.898 --> 02:12:30.898
Bye Henry, don't get in the fire.

3614
02:12:30.898 --> 02:12:33.898
BRIAN: Do not light my dog on fire.

3615
02:12:33.898 --> 02:12:35.315
DANI: Jesus.

3616
02:12:37.463 --> 02:12:40.213
[dramatic music]

3617
02:12:42.927 --> 02:12:44.348
DANI: (sighing)

3618
02:12:44.348 --> 02:12:47.681
I just want to watch my Critical Role!

3619
02:12:48.548 --> 02:12:50.436
TALIESIN: For your consideration,

3620
02:12:50.436 --> 02:12:52.196
this is the face of a Critter who's craving

3621
02:12:52.196 --> 02:12:54.367
their Critical Role content,

3622
02:12:54.367 --> 02:12:56.446
but for this sanctimonious shipper,

3623
02:12:56.446 --> 02:12:59.298
time misled them like a trip to the Feywild.

3624
02:12:59.298 --> 02:13:02.548
They now have come face to face with existential dread,

3625
02:13:02.548 --> 02:13:05.723
a fear of sardonic spoilers.

3626
02:13:05.723 --> 02:13:07.276
Let us lead them across the bridge

3627
02:13:07.276 --> 02:13:09.588
into a realm of bright shadows where,

3628
02:13:09.588 --> 02:13:11.396
even if one misses the live viewing

3629
02:13:11.396 --> 02:13:13.007
of their favorite program,

3630
02:13:13.007 --> 02:13:15.086
they can still watch it on demand,

3631
02:13:15.086 --> 02:13:17.118
if they bear the mark of a Twitch subscription

3632
02:13:17.118 --> 02:13:18.724
to the channel.

3633
02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:21.377
That mark, a mysterious sigil of emoticons

3634
02:13:21.377 --> 02:13:25.012
made by the sage, ArseQueef.

3635
02:13:25.012 --> 02:13:26.324
In this land of shadow

3636
02:13:26.324 --> 02:13:28.524
known as the Twitch subscription zone,

3637
02:13:28.524 --> 02:13:30.262
no shipper, fanficcer,

3638
02:13:30.262 --> 02:13:32.372
or please name my kitten litter critter

3639
02:13:32.372 --> 02:13:35.061
has to feel like a bitter fritter.

3640
02:13:35.061 --> 02:13:38.313
And so ends another meandering digression.

3641
02:13:38.313 --> 02:13:41.644
A complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

3642
02:13:41.644 --> 02:13:43.644

[dramatic music]

3650
02:25:08.027 --> 02:25:09.284
MATT: Welcome back.

3651
02:25:09.284 --> 02:25:11.134
(laughter)

3652
02:25:11.134 --> 02:25:12.094
Before we get back to the game,

3653
02:25:12.094 --> 02:25:13.726
we do have our winner of our Twitch giveaway,

3654
02:25:13.726 --> 02:25:17.648
which is xgwenthercorpx.

3655
02:25:17.648 --> 02:25:19.100
(laughter)

3656
02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:20.529
xgwenthercorpx.

3657
02:25:20.529 --> 02:25:24.612
Awesome Xbox Live name and/or AOL account title.

3658
02:25:25.857 --> 02:25:27.764
LIAM: That is the name of a red wizard from Fey, come on.

3659
02:25:27.764 --> 02:25:28.724
MATT: It's true, it's true.

3660
02:25:28.724 --> 02:25:29.902
No, it's awesome, congratulations.

3661
02:25:29.902 --> 02:25:31.402
We'll get our awesome

3662
02:25:32.917 --> 02:25:36.693
Wyrmwood dice tray,

3663
02:25:36.693 --> 02:25:39.110
or the various dice or tiles.

3664
02:25:40.267 --> 02:25:43.112
They're our tabletop tiles, there we go, that's the title,

3665
02:25:43.112 --> 02:25:44.683
my brain, it's been a little scattered here,

3666
02:25:44.683 --> 02:25:48.056
but these are the aromatic cedar coming your way.

3667
02:25:48.056 --> 02:25:49.749
Get excited.

3668
02:25:49.749 --> 02:25:50.924
It's my favorite, is the cedar.

3669
02:25:50.924 --> 02:25:52.949
TRAVIS: It's so rad. Keeps away moss!

3670
02:25:52.949 --> 02:25:53.782
MATT: All righty.

3671
02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:56.246
So.

3672
02:25:57.766 --> 02:25:59.482
As the large skeletal giant--

3673
02:25:59.482 --> 02:26:00.648
TRAVIS: No. No!

3674
02:26:00.648 --> 02:26:03.720
MATT: --has now risen from the crafts chamber,

3675
02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:06.984
the rest of you gathered up beneath the top,

3676
02:26:06.984 --> 02:26:09.886
in that area, the two of you turn the corner,

3677
02:26:09.886 --> 02:26:12.046
clutching this metallic disk object

3678
02:26:12.046 --> 02:26:14.577
that you managed to find in the bottom of the bone pit

3679
02:26:14.577 --> 02:26:17.938
and turn to see this entity (cracking).

3680
02:26:17.938 --> 02:26:19.067
TALIESIN: Take it to the others.

3681
02:26:19.067 --> 02:26:20.097
TRAVIS: ♪ Take it to the bridge ♪

3682
02:26:20.097 --> 02:26:22.896
SAM: What--are you going to stay here?

3683
02:26:22.896 --> 02:26:23.729
Oh my god.

3684
02:26:24.850 --> 02:26:27.118
MATT: I'd like you both to roll initiative.

3685
02:26:27.118 --> 02:26:27.951
MARISHA: Just run!

3686
02:26:27.951 --> 02:26:29.387
SAM: Terrible.

3687
02:26:29.387 --> 02:26:30.334
MARISHA: Just run back!

3688
02:26:30.334 --> 02:26:31.944
SAM: Eight.

3689
02:26:31.944 --> 02:26:32.777
TALIESIN: 11.

3690
02:26:32.777 --> 02:26:35.092
TRAVIS: Go lie under the charred body of your fellow goblin.

3691
02:26:35.092 --> 02:26:37.342
(laughter)

3692
02:26:42.091 --> 02:26:43.566
MARISHA: Some Saving Private Ryan shit.

3693
02:26:43.566 --> 02:26:44.899
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, yeah.

3694
02:26:46.957 --> 02:26:47.874
TALIESIN: Does my--

3695
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:49.663
TRAVIS: Does it?

3696
02:26:49.663 --> 02:26:52.158
TALIESIN: Does my thing follow the jellyfish now, still,

3697
02:26:52.158 --> 02:26:54.772
because we still haven't gotten that one hit.

3698
02:26:54.772 --> 02:26:56.945
Is the jellyfish still touched by--?

3699
02:26:56.945 --> 02:26:57.778
MATT: How long does it last?

3700
02:26:57.778 --> 02:26:58.878
TALIESIN: That's a good question.

3701
02:26:58.878 --> 02:27:01.278
I'll find out while we figure out what's up.

3702
02:27:01.278 --> 02:27:02.142
TRAVIS: What the hell is the jellyfish?

3703
02:27:02.142 --> 02:27:03.975
What are you talking about?

3704
02:27:03.975 --> 02:27:05.175
LAURA: The jellyfish.

3705
02:27:05.175 --> 02:27:06.353
TRAVIS: The jellyfishes in hell?

3706
02:27:06.353 --> 02:27:08.020
SAM: With initiative of eight am I going first, Matt?

3707
02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:09.145
MATT: You are not.

3708
02:27:09.145 --> 02:27:09.986
SAM: Okay.

3709
02:27:09.986 --> 02:27:12.294
MARISHA: There's no jellyfishes in hell!

3710
02:27:12.294 --> 02:27:13.644
TRAVIS: I dispute this!

3711
02:27:13.644 --> 02:27:15.185
MATT: The entity is going first.

3712
02:27:15.185 --> 02:27:16.018
SAM: Sure.

3713
02:27:16.018 --> 02:27:19.637
MATT: As it clatters forward, its bone claw snags the stone

3714
02:27:19.637 --> 02:27:21.198
and scrapes as it pulls itself.

3715
02:27:21.198 --> 02:27:23.524
It lurches and almost seems to stumble

3716
02:27:23.524 --> 02:27:25.169
and its body clattering

3717
02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:29.070
as the strips of cloth and skin hang from its exposed bones

3718
02:27:29.070 --> 02:27:30.737
that are still scraped and mangled

3719
02:27:30.737 --> 02:27:33.892
from demons that tore into it and pulled apart the innards.

3720
02:27:33.892 --> 02:27:35.070
It reaches out,

3721
02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:37.505
grabbing one of the large pieces of unworked stone,

3722
02:27:37.505 --> 02:27:42.505
it--woof--comes down with a heavy swing

3723
02:27:42.531 --> 02:27:44.891
towards you, Caduceus.

3724
02:27:44.891 --> 02:27:46.199
SAM: Oh no!

3725
02:27:46.199 --> 02:27:47.819
Mr. Clay!

3726
02:27:47.819 --> 02:27:49.641
MATT: Each of you, one giant swing towards both of you,

3727
02:27:49.641 --> 02:27:51.045
both of its attacks are going to be.

3728
02:27:51.045 --> 02:27:55.761
Against you Nott, that is going to be a 19 to hit.

3729
02:27:55.761 --> 02:27:57.333
SAM: Uncanny dodge.

3730
02:27:57.333 --> 02:27:58.750
MATT: All righty.

3731
02:28:00.762 --> 02:28:03.623
MATT: (laughs)

3732
02:28:03.623 --> 02:28:05.790
That is going to put it at--

3733
02:28:10.318 --> 02:28:12.923
27 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half,

3734
02:28:12.923 --> 02:28:14.636
so you take 13.

3735
02:28:14.636 --> 02:28:16.007
TRAVIS: Shit, man.

3736
02:28:16.007 --> 02:28:18.046
MATT: Against Caduceus.

3737
02:28:18.046 --> 02:28:19.195
Natural 18.

3738
02:28:19.195 --> 02:28:20.335
TALIESIN: Fuck, I'm hit.

3739
02:28:20.335 --> 02:28:21.681
MATT: Yeah, it's going to be a 27 to hit.

3740
02:28:21.681 --> 02:28:24.462
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah that hits.

3741
02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:25.774
SAM: Mr. Clay!

3742
02:28:25.774 --> 02:28:27.323
(laughter)

3743
02:28:27.323 --> 02:28:28.343
ASHLEY: Ah!

3744
02:28:28.343 --> 02:28:30.647
MATT: 22 points of bludgeoning damage.

3745
02:28:30.647 --> 02:28:32.807
As your both (thudding) almost knocked off your feet,

3746
02:28:32.807 --> 02:28:34.161
you skid to the ground,

3747
02:28:34.161 --> 02:28:36.430
and the creature grabs the stone piece again

3748
02:28:36.430 --> 02:28:38.327
and it picks up, it looks like a giant long brick

3749
02:28:38.327 --> 02:28:40.509
that it's bludgeoning you with.

3750
02:28:40.509 --> 02:28:41.852
That ends its turn.

3751
02:28:41.852 --> 02:28:43.943
LAURA: Did we hear anything, can we hear any commotion?

3752
02:28:43.943 --> 02:28:44.926
TALIESIN: We're yelling!

3753
02:28:44.926 --> 02:28:47.433
MATT: They're yelling down the hallway.

3754
02:28:47.433 --> 02:28:50.567
You guys are all up here as he's finished the dome.

3755
02:28:50.567 --> 02:28:51.646
SAM: Mr. Clay!

3756
02:28:51.646 --> 02:28:55.031
ASHLEY: an I see from where I'm at?

3757
02:28:55.031 --> 02:28:56.686
MATT: From where you are now you hear shouting,

3758
02:28:56.686 --> 02:28:59.240
and you glance out the side and can see them engage.

3759
02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:00.073
ASHLEY: I start running.

3760
02:29:00.073 --> 02:29:01.367
MATT: I need you to roll initiative.

3761
02:29:01.367 --> 02:29:02.267
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

3762
02:29:02.267 --> 02:29:03.885
MATT: 'Til right now,

3763
02:29:03.885 --> 02:29:05.589
all of you guys aren't in this combat round,

3764
02:29:05.589 --> 02:29:07.716
but we'll add you to the next combat round.

3765
02:29:07.716 --> 02:29:10.967
MARISHA: Beau is going through her notes in the corner.

3766
02:29:10.967 --> 02:29:12.779
I'm surrounded by notebooks.

3767
02:29:12.779 --> 02:29:14.267
MATT: Over here you mean?

3768
02:29:14.267 --> 02:29:15.117
MARISHA: In the dome.

3769
02:29:15.117 --> 02:29:16.103
MATT: In the dome, yeah.

3770
02:29:16.103 --> 02:29:16.936
MARISHA: Yeah.

3771
02:29:16.936 --> 02:29:17.769
ASHLEY: 18.

3772
02:29:17.769 --> 02:29:18.779
LAURA: 21.

3773
02:29:18.779 --> 02:29:19.812
ASHLEY: Yeah!

3774
02:29:19.812 --> 02:29:21.284
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah.

3775
02:29:21.284 --> 02:29:22.534
TRAVIS: Ah, fuck yeah.

3776
02:29:26.039 --> 02:29:27.482
MATT: Everyone else rolling initiative

3777
02:29:27.482 --> 02:29:28.493
to enter this next round?

3778
02:29:28.493 --> 02:29:29.826
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll go.

3779
02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:34.097
Natural one. That's fitting since I was caught reading,

3780
02:29:34.097 --> 02:29:35.032
so six.

3781
02:29:35.032 --> 02:29:35.865
TRAVIS: 15.

3782
02:29:36.799 --> 02:29:38.466
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: Better.

3783
02:29:40.576 --> 02:29:41.656
MATT: Caleb?

3784
02:29:41.656 --> 02:29:45.234
LIAM: Oh sorry, I was thinking about spells, shockingly.

3785
02:29:45.234 --> 02:29:46.067
16.

3786
02:29:46.067 --> 02:29:47.100
MATT: 16.

3787
02:29:50.335 --> 02:29:51.751
And Fjord what were you again, you were--?

3788
02:29:51.751 --> 02:29:52.831
TRAVIS: 15.

3789
02:29:52.831 --> 02:29:53.839
Fi-deen!

3790
02:29:53.839 --> 02:29:56.309
LAURA and TRAVIS: Fi-deen!

3791
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:57.439
LIAM: I have a question, too.

3792
02:29:57.439 --> 02:29:58.514
TRAVIS: Yeah?

3793
02:29:58.514 --> 02:30:00.463
LIAM: I had Frumpkin sitting outside the dome

3794
02:30:00.463 --> 02:30:02.751
to tell me if anything amiss was happening,

3795
02:30:02.751 --> 02:30:04.551
so did Frumpkin see a jellyfish

3796
02:30:04.551 --> 02:30:06.677
float out of the turtle and then, (slurping).

3797
02:30:06.677 --> 02:30:08.983
MATT: Yep. And let you know that.

3798
02:30:08.983 --> 02:30:11.237
LIAM: So the turtle is just there,

3799
02:30:11.237 --> 02:30:13.519
like not moving, at this point?

3800
02:30:13.519 --> 02:30:14.511
MATT: No, the turtle was not visible,

3801
02:30:14.511 --> 02:30:15.727
the turtle was thrown into the portal.

3802
02:30:15.727 --> 02:30:17.032
LIAM: Oh that's right, that's right,

3803
02:30:17.032 --> 02:30:18.157
so it's just a new jellyfish?

3804
02:30:18.157 --> 02:30:19.647
MATT: You just watched a jellyfish go, poof (slurping).

3805
02:30:19.647 --> 02:30:20.847
LAURA: Oh!

3806
02:30:20.847 --> 02:30:22.347
LIAM: Thank you, thank you.

3807
02:30:22.347 --> 02:30:23.560
LAURA: I thought it came out of the turtle.

3808
02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:24.424
LIAM: Right.

3809
02:30:24.424 --> 02:30:26.674
MATT: The turtle you never saw.

3810
02:30:27.656 --> 02:30:29.994
LIAM: Where is the turtle now?

3811
02:30:29.994 --> 02:30:32.244
LAURA: Aw, living its best life.

3812
02:30:33.535 --> 02:30:34.719
MATT: It's polymorphed,

3813
02:30:34.719 --> 02:30:37.022
there isn't an actual turtle anymore!

3814
02:30:37.022 --> 02:30:38.577
TRAVIS: Fuck your turtle!

3815
02:30:38.577 --> 02:30:40.127
MATT: Jesus christ, guys!

3816
02:30:40.127 --> 02:30:44.603
That brings us to--that turn--Nott.

3817
02:30:44.603 --> 02:30:46.110
No, Caduceus, you're up first.

3818
02:30:47.327 --> 02:30:48.587
TALIESIN: Okay.

3819
02:30:48.587 --> 02:30:50.725
MATT: After the impact and the slamming heavy sounds.

3820
02:30:50.725 --> 02:30:51.829
(growling)

3821
02:30:51.829 --> 02:30:52.895
TRAVIS: Talk now.

3822
02:30:52.895 --> 02:30:54.372
MATT: The rest of you are now aware,

3823
02:30:54.372 --> 02:30:55.992
between Caleb making note

3824
02:30:55.992 --> 02:30:57.839
that something weird came out of the portal.

3825
02:30:57.839 --> 02:31:00.251
(laughter)

3826
02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:01.295
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Something weird

3827
02:31:01.295 --> 02:31:02.473
came out of the portal!

3828
02:31:02.473 --> 02:31:04.171
(laughter)

3829
02:31:04.171 --> 02:31:05.229
MARISHA: We're sorry!

3830
02:31:05.229 --> 02:31:06.254
TRAVIS: C'mon, baby!

3831
02:31:08.624 --> 02:31:09.759
MATT: The heavy sounds of impact

3832
02:31:09.759 --> 02:31:11.055
and screaming down the hallway,

3833
02:31:11.055 --> 02:31:13.860
you're all aware that something is wrong.

3834
02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:16.058
TALIESIN: I am definitely going to yell,

3835
02:31:16.058 --> 02:31:18.952
definitely going to do a little yelling of, help,

3836
02:31:18.952 --> 02:31:21.567
there's another one, and we found a crazy disk again!

3837
02:31:21.567 --> 02:31:24.664
I'm going to--found a crazy disk.

3838
02:31:24.664 --> 02:31:26.568
I'm going to cast Ray of Enfeeblement.

3839
02:31:26.568 --> 02:31:27.485
ALL: Ooh!

3840
02:31:30.305 --> 02:31:31.203
ASHLEY: Ooh!

3841
02:31:31.203 --> 02:31:32.680
TALIESIN: Let that come out your portal!

3842
02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:35.211
(laughter)

3843
02:31:35.211 --> 02:31:36.128
That's a--

3844
02:31:44.631 --> 02:31:46.648
That's a constitution saving--yeah.

3845
02:31:46.648 --> 02:31:50.357
MATT: Constitution saving throw or is it a attack roll?

3846
02:31:50.357 --> 02:31:51.255
Ray is usually a--

3847
02:31:51.255 --> 02:31:52.287
LAURA: Constitution saving--

3848
02:31:52.287 --> 02:31:54.171
MATT: Got to make a ranged spell attack against the target.

3849
02:31:54.171 --> 02:31:55.421
MATT: So roll that.

3850
02:31:56.775 --> 02:31:57.608
TALIESIN: Oh!

3851
02:31:58.443 --> 02:32:00.889
That's a 19 plus god only knows.

3852
02:32:00.889 --> 02:32:02.556
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

3853
02:32:04.087 --> 02:32:05.583
Target only deals half damage

3854
02:32:05.583 --> 02:32:07.192
with strength attacks until the spell ends.

3855
02:32:07.192 --> 02:32:08.025
LAURA: Nice.

3856
02:32:08.025 --> 02:32:10.010
MATT: Great. So you are concentrating.

3857
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.843
TALIESIN: I am.

3858
02:32:12.376 --> 02:32:14.475
MATT: Now it does half damage with strength attacks.

3859
02:32:14.475 --> 02:32:16.456
Oof, that's fucked.

3860
02:32:16.456 --> 02:32:18.086
TRAVIS: To everything it hits?

3861
02:32:18.086 --> 02:32:19.936
MATT: If it uses strength.

3862
02:32:19.936 --> 02:32:20.769
LAURA: Nice.

3863
02:32:20.769 --> 02:32:21.910
TALIESIN: It's a big clunky thing.

3864
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:22.994
TRAVIS: Yeah buddy.

3865
02:32:22.994 --> 02:32:24.827
TALIESIN: Let's burn that spell slot.

3866
02:32:27.872 --> 02:32:29.752
I'm going to--we're engaged,

3867
02:32:29.752 --> 02:32:34.335
so if I back up five feet, I'm not going to be losing its--

3868
02:32:35.320 --> 02:32:36.795
I'm not going to be disengaging with it am I?

3869
02:32:36.795 --> 02:32:38.645
MATT: Gathering at the length of its reach

3870
02:32:38.645 --> 02:32:40.059
from what you've seen, if you move five feet away,

3871
02:32:40.059 --> 02:32:41.079
you're still within its reach.

3872
02:32:41.079 --> 02:32:43.432
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, so I'm going to back away five feet

3873
02:32:43.432 --> 02:32:46.875
and so that people can actually, hopefully see what's up.

3874
02:32:46.875 --> 02:32:47.708
MATT: You got it.

3875
02:32:47.708 --> 02:32:48.541
That finishes your go?

3876
02:32:48.541 --> 02:32:49.374
TALIESIN: Yep.

3877
02:32:49.374 --> 02:32:51.208
MATT: Nott, you're up.

3878
02:32:51.208 --> 02:32:54.902
SAM: With one hand, I will hold up the disk,

3879
02:32:54.902 --> 02:32:58.319
with the other hand I will draw my pistol

3880
02:32:59.564 --> 02:33:03.304
and I will fire at the giant, through the disk.

3881
02:33:03.304 --> 02:33:04.137
MATT: Okay.

3882
02:33:04.137 --> 02:33:05.512
LAURA: Oh, shit.

3883
02:33:05.512 --> 02:33:06.568
MATT: Roll damage.

3884
02:33:06.568 --> 02:33:07.637
SAM: Okay.

3885
02:33:07.637 --> 02:33:08.872
It's a d10.

3886
02:33:11.188 --> 02:33:14.390
Oh, terrible, seven points of damage.

3887
02:33:14.390 --> 02:33:15.340
MATT: Seven points of damage,

3888
02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:17.739
and then roll an attack with disadvantage against the giant.

3889
02:33:17.739 --> 02:33:18.572
SAM: Okay.

3890
02:33:21.029 --> 02:33:23.717
13 is the lower, 18 to hit.

3891
02:33:23.717 --> 02:33:25.301
MATT: Still hits, roll damage against the giant.

3892
02:33:25.301 --> 02:33:26.134
SAM: Ooh!

3893
02:33:27.580 --> 02:33:28.888
Ooh, 11!

3894
02:33:28.888 --> 02:33:32.091
That's a nine, 14 points of damage!

3895
02:33:32.091 --> 02:33:33.640
MATT: 14 points of damage.

3896
02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:37.863
As you, (thudding), the crystal globe in the center

3897
02:33:37.863 --> 02:33:40.863
of this device (splattering) shatters outward.

3898
02:33:40.863 --> 02:33:43.213
Whatever mercury-like material

3899
02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:44.799
that was originally held within the inside

3900
02:33:44.799 --> 02:33:45.926
is scattered outward

3901
02:33:45.926 --> 02:33:48.167
with the shards of broken crystal and glass.

3902
02:33:48.167 --> 02:33:49.650
TRAVIS: Don't let it touch your skin!

3903
02:33:49.650 --> 02:33:52.802
MATT: The coils and the crystals on the sides dim

3904
02:33:52.802 --> 02:33:54.770
and the bullet continues on

3905
02:33:54.770 --> 02:33:56.689
and blasts into the skeletal creature,

3906
02:33:56.689 --> 02:33:59.594
you can see it hit and splinter part of the clavicle bone

3907
02:33:59.594 --> 02:34:02.559
and elements of its back shoulder blade.

3908
02:34:02.559 --> 02:34:07.559
SAM: I'm going to say to the giant: Eldritch Blast!

3909
02:34:09.290 --> 02:34:11.754
Then I'm going to disengage and run!

3910
02:34:11.754 --> 02:34:14.337
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.

3911
02:34:16.164 --> 02:34:17.631
TALIESIN: It's okay.

3912
02:34:17.631 --> 02:34:19.907
MATT: There you go, then yeah,

3913
02:34:19.907 --> 02:34:23.077
the device is predominantly not functional.

3914
02:34:23.077 --> 02:34:23.952
SAM: Great.

3915
02:34:23.952 --> 02:34:24.962
MATT: That finishes your go,

3916
02:34:24.962 --> 02:34:28.116
it is now back to the top of the round here,

3917
02:34:28.116 --> 02:34:29.170
Jester, you're up first.

3918
02:34:29.170 --> 02:34:32.078
LAURA: Sweet, I'm going to run to the doorway,

3919
02:34:32.078 --> 02:34:35.010
actually I'm going to run 30 feet, however far that is.

3920
02:34:35.010 --> 02:34:35.843
MATT: Right there.

3921
02:34:35.843 --> 02:34:36.840
SAM: Got some cotton in your mouth?

3922
02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:39.307
MATT: You can see the big skeletal giant (growling).

3923
02:34:39.307 --> 02:34:40.686
LAURA: (screams)

3924
02:34:40.686 --> 02:34:44.479
I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt at 2nd-level.

3925
02:34:44.479 --> 02:34:46.037
TRAVIS: ♪ Guiding bolt ♪

3926
02:34:46.037 --> 02:34:47.250
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ Up the butt ♪

3927
02:34:47.250 --> 02:34:48.523
LAURA: ♪ Right up the butt ♪

3928
02:34:48.523 --> 02:34:49.420
ASHLEY: (as Pike) Yeah.

3929
02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:51.735
TALIESIN: Now you're playing with portals.

3930
02:34:51.735 --> 02:34:53.434
MATT: Go ahead and roll the attack.

3931
02:34:53.434 --> 02:34:56.597
LAURA: That's finally a good roll.

3932
02:34:56.597 --> 02:34:57.430
27.

3933
02:34:57.430 --> 02:34:59.215
MATT: That definitely hits, roll damage.

3934
02:34:59.215 --> 02:35:01.798
LAURA: There's the 5d6 I was seeing.

3935
02:35:02.741 --> 02:35:04.266
Ooh!

3936
02:35:05.189 --> 02:35:10.189
Ten, 18, 21!

3937
02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:12.582
MATT: 21 points of damage. Nice!

3938
02:35:12.582 --> 02:35:13.554
LAURA: Then--

3939
02:35:13.554 --> 02:35:17.048
MATT: (thudding) Part of its pelvic bone

3940
02:35:17.048 --> 02:35:20.840
breaks and splinters off and its leg limps to one side.

3941
02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:22.639
LAURA: Next attack is at advantage against it.

3942
02:35:22.639 --> 02:35:26.813
MATT: You got it. All right. That finishes your turn?

3943
02:35:26.813 --> 02:35:28.879
It's now the creatures turn.

3944
02:35:28.879 --> 02:35:32.250
SAM: Oh, Mr. Clay! Mr. Clay!

3945
02:35:32.250 --> 02:35:33.618
LAURA: Do I have any movement left?

3946
02:35:33.618 --> 02:35:36.632
MATT: No, it was 30 feet to get there.

3947
02:35:36.632 --> 02:35:37.770
The creature comes forward again,

3948
02:35:37.770 --> 02:35:42.559
grabs its bludgeoning stone piece in its hand--

3949
02:35:42.559 --> 02:35:44.922
TALIESIN: You're not looking too hot.

3950
02:35:44.922 --> 02:35:49.698
MATT: (growls) Let's see here, hold on.

3951
02:35:49.698 --> 02:35:51.654
First, it's going to look down at you,

3952
02:35:51.654 --> 02:35:55.571
and in your direction, it's going to move,

3953
02:35:56.696 --> 02:35:59.925
it's actually going to move a little this way

3954
02:35:59.925 --> 02:36:02.058
into this space to get in the vicinity.

3955
02:36:02.058 --> 02:36:02.911
SAM: Damn.

3956
02:36:02.911 --> 02:36:06.847
MATT: As it steps over you, Caduceus,

3957
02:36:06.847 --> 02:36:08.421
holding its thing in the air

3958
02:36:08.421 --> 02:36:09.464
and looking towards both of you,

3959
02:36:09.464 --> 02:36:12.523
and you're glancing over your shoulder, Nott.

3960
02:36:12.523 --> 02:36:14.479
You watch as the sutures in the skull,

3961
02:36:14.479 --> 02:36:18.069
split open and shard

3962
02:36:18.069 --> 02:36:20.888
and the brain begins to

3963
02:36:20.888 --> 02:36:22.773
ooze out of the center of it

3964
02:36:22.773 --> 02:36:24.117
and into the middle of its face

3965
02:36:24.117 --> 02:36:27.600
and slop onto the ground and its head turns to the side

3966
02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:31.420
and gives this horrible shrieking sound.

3967
02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:33.439
I need both of you to make wisdom saving throws,

3968
02:36:33.439 --> 02:36:35.309
will you please.

3969
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:36.442
TALIESIN: Eh.

3970
02:36:37.701 --> 02:36:39.481
SAM: 12.

3971
02:36:39.481 --> 02:36:40.314
TALIESIN: 13.

3972
02:36:40.314 --> 02:36:41.263
MATT: Both of you guys succeed.

3973
02:36:41.263 --> 02:36:44.497
SAM: Oh! I was not expecting that.

3974
02:36:44.497 --> 02:36:47.672
MATT: The sense of fear almost fills you,

3975
02:36:47.672 --> 02:36:50.922
but you've fought one of these before

3976
02:36:50.922 --> 02:36:53.108
and it's just a skeleton, how bad could it be?

3977
02:36:53.108 --> 02:36:56.766
As it goes and attempts to bludgeon you twice.

3978
02:36:56.766 --> 02:36:57.683
Natural 20.

3979
02:36:58.699 --> 02:37:00.115
TALIESIN: I cancel that.

3980
02:37:00.115 --> 02:37:00.948
MATT: Can you cancel it on other people

3981
02:37:00.948 --> 02:37:03.072
or against you as well?

3982
02:37:03.072 --> 02:37:04.651
Double check that, just to be sure.

3983
02:37:04.651 --> 02:37:09.354
Second attack is going to be 22 to hit.

3984
02:37:09.354 --> 02:37:12.152
TALIESIN: Hold on, is that with the half damage?

3985
02:37:12.152 --> 02:37:13.819
MATT: 22 to hit, I haven't rolled damage yet.

3986
02:37:13.819 --> 02:37:17.639
TALIESIN: Oh, 22 definitely hits but hold on one second.

3987
02:37:17.639 --> 02:37:19.064
When any creature you can see

3988
02:37:19.064 --> 02:37:21.499
within 30 feet suffers a critical hit.

3989
02:37:21.499 --> 02:37:22.963
MATT: That would be yourself, you can, yeah.

3990
02:37:22.963 --> 02:37:23.995
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's undo that.

3991
02:37:23.995 --> 02:37:25.374
MATT: Okay, so straight damage.

3992
02:37:25.374 --> 02:37:27.007
SAM: That is the best feature ever.

3993
02:37:27.007 --> 02:37:30.008
TALIESIN: Then that's straight damage halved, I believe.

3994
02:37:30.008 --> 02:37:31.871
MATT: Correct.

3995
02:37:31.871 --> 02:37:35.308
TALIESIN: I know, I can do it so many times, too.

3996
02:37:35.308 --> 02:37:37.195
SAM: How many times?
TALIESIN: Five times per long rest.

3997
02:37:37.195 --> 02:37:38.228
SAM: Oh my god!

3998
02:37:38.228 --> 02:37:39.061
TALIESIN: As long as I can see

3999
02:37:39.061 --> 02:37:40.177
what's happening within 30 feet.

4000
02:37:40.177 --> 02:37:42.475
SAM: Wow, if only we had that when Mollymauk was around.

4001
02:37:42.475 --> 02:37:45.429
MATT: 22 points of bludgeoning damage,

4002
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:46.868
halved, so take 11 points.

4003
02:37:46.868 --> 02:37:49.501
LAURA: That's with his strength modifier lowered?

4004
02:37:49.501 --> 02:37:51.601
MATT: Correct.

4005
02:37:53.843 --> 02:37:55.818
Make a concentration check.

4006
02:37:55.818 --> 02:37:57.115
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm, with advantage?

4007
02:37:57.115 --> 02:38:00.309
MATT: Yes, because you have War Caster.

4008
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:03.237
TALIESIN: Thank god, so that's 20,

4009
02:38:03.237 --> 02:38:04.699
a constitution check or save?

4010
02:38:04.699 --> 02:38:06.365
MATT: It's a save.
TALIESIN: 20.

4011
02:38:06.365 --> 02:38:07.413
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

4012
02:38:07.413 --> 02:38:09.416
Second strike comes to bludgeon you again,

4013
02:38:09.416 --> 02:38:11.323
it's going to be 20 to hit.

4014
02:38:11.323 --> 02:38:14.098
TALIESIN: That hits. Rolling well.

4015
02:38:16.533 --> 02:38:18.079
LAURA: Ooh, you got a pretty background.

4016
02:38:18.079 --> 02:38:21.571
MATT: 18 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to nine.

4017
02:38:21.571 --> 02:38:23.144
You take nine points,

4018
02:38:23.144 --> 02:38:25.202
make another concentration check.

4019
02:38:25.202 --> 02:38:26.283
LAURA: His is prettier, though.

4020
02:38:26.283 --> 02:38:28.258
SAM: What's yours? Standard?

4021
02:38:29.832 --> 02:38:31.133
LIAM: Ya basic.

4022
02:38:31.133 --> 02:38:32.085
TALIESIN: 18.

4023
02:38:32.085 --> 02:38:34.063
MATT: Yeah, so you maintain concentration on that.

4024
02:38:34.063 --> 02:38:35.419
That ends its turn.

4025
02:38:35.419 --> 02:38:38.133
It seems frustrated by the Ray of Enfeeblement.

4026
02:38:38.133 --> 02:38:38.966
TALIESIN: Yep.

4027
02:38:38.966 --> 02:38:42.367
MATT: It's attempting to remove the current issue.

4028
02:38:42.367 --> 02:38:44.646
That brings us now to the next round.

4029
02:38:44.646 --> 02:38:45.861
Yasha, you're up.

4030
02:38:45.861 --> 02:38:48.864
ASHLEY: Okay, so I will start running towards them.

4031
02:38:48.864 --> 02:38:51.720
SAM: ♪ Running with the night! ♪

4032
02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:53.341
MATT: (counting) 35, 40.

4033
02:38:53.341 --> 02:38:57.939
ASHLEY: Then I'll dash for the rest of my movement.

4034
02:38:57.939 --> 02:38:59.305
MATT: (counting) 35, 40.

4035
02:38:59.305 --> 02:39:00.330
SAM: Hello Yasha!

4036
02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:01.538
MATT: Not quite in range yet.

4037
02:39:01.538 --> 02:39:02.875
ASHLEY: Hello!

4038
02:39:02.875 --> 02:39:05.166
SAM and ASHLEY: Hi.

4039
02:39:05.166 --> 02:39:06.891
ASHLEY: I just say hello and that's the end of my turn.

4040
02:39:06.891 --> 02:39:09.547
MATT: Okay, there you go, proper Yasha greeting.

4041
02:39:09.547 --> 02:39:11.273
Finishing that moves us to Caleb.

4042
02:39:11.273 --> 02:39:12.106
ASHLEY: Hello!

4043
02:39:12.106 --> 02:39:13.338
TRAVIS: She's so fucking polite!

4044
02:39:13.338 --> 02:39:15.307
LIAM: All of the noise down below plus

4045
02:39:15.307 --> 02:39:16.808
that little teleporting jellyfish,

4046
02:39:16.808 --> 02:39:17.681
I know what's going on,

4047
02:39:17.681 --> 02:39:20.504
I just walk down the stairs, the dome vanishes,

4048
02:39:20.504 --> 02:39:24.364
and I would like to go where Yasha was standing

4049
02:39:24.364 --> 02:39:25.793
so I can see down the hall.

4050
02:39:25.793 --> 02:39:28.136
Back, no, yeah, into that spot.

4051
02:39:28.136 --> 02:39:32.347
I'm pulling the catmint out of my pocket

4052
02:39:32.347 --> 02:39:34.939
and weaving my fingers here and muttering

4053
02:39:34.939 --> 02:39:38.897
and I cast Cat's Ire and the giant cat's claw

4054
02:39:38.897 --> 02:39:41.480
appears right in front of the giant's face.

4055
02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:43.071
MATT: Cat's Ire is what level?

4056
02:39:43.071 --> 02:39:44.718
LIAM: Fifth.

4057
02:39:44.718 --> 02:39:46.863
I have one fifth, didn't we sleep before we came in here?

4058
02:39:46.863 --> 02:39:47.696
LAURA: No.

4059
02:39:47.696 --> 02:39:49.099
LIAM: We didn't, then I don't do that.

4060
02:39:49.099 --> 02:39:51.896
MATT: Well no, you cast it when we were at the--

4061
02:39:51.896 --> 02:39:53.262
LIAM: Earlier at the fort.

4062
02:39:53.262 --> 02:39:55.015
MATT: The fort, so you would have it back.

4063
02:39:55.015 --> 02:39:56.115
LIAM: So I do have it.

4064
02:39:56.115 --> 02:39:58.062
Haters, haters, haters.

4065
02:39:58.062 --> 02:39:58.895
MATT: No, I was trying to clarify.

4066
02:39:58.895 --> 02:40:00.345
LAURA: I was confused.
TALIESIN: I'm hater.

4067
02:40:00.345 --> 02:40:01.217
LIAM: You're a lover.

4068
02:40:01.217 --> 02:40:03.292
SAM: Did we sleep here?
TALIESIN: No, not in here.

4069
02:40:03.292 --> 02:40:04.808
MATT: No, but you did have a night's rest before.

4070
02:40:04.808 --> 02:40:06.510
SAM: That's right.
MATT: You're putting it where?

4071
02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:08.059
LIAM: Right in front of the giant's face

4072
02:40:08.059 --> 02:40:11.214
and I'm going to--120 feet.

4073
02:40:11.214 --> 02:40:12.366
MATT: Yeah, easy enough.

4074
02:40:12.366 --> 02:40:14.024
LIAM: I'm going to slash it in the face.

4075
02:40:14.024 --> 02:40:16.121
MATT: Go for it.
LIAM: Okay.

4076
02:40:16.121 --> 02:40:17.576
ASHLEY: Meow!

4077
02:40:17.576 --> 02:40:21.149
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (meowing)

4078
02:40:21.149 --> 02:40:22.899
LIAM: Okay, 4d8.

4079
02:40:27.163 --> 02:40:31.182
Well, average, 13, 14, 15 of slashing damage to its face.

4080
02:40:31.182 --> 02:40:32.015
MATT: All righty.

4081
02:40:33.787 --> 02:40:35.994
LIAM: That is the end of my turn.

4082
02:40:35.994 --> 02:40:37.962
MATT: Ending Caleb's turn, that brings us to Fjord

4083
02:40:37.962 --> 02:40:39.246
and then Caduceus, you're on deck.

4084
02:40:39.246 --> 02:40:40.245
TRAVIS: Right.

4085
02:40:40.245 --> 02:40:43.812
I will use my movement to come down 30 feet.

4086
02:40:46.281 --> 02:40:47.993
MATT: 30 if you want to get there.

4087
02:40:47.993 --> 02:40:49.457
TRAVIS: Can I have visual on?

4088
02:40:49.457 --> 02:40:51.377
MATT: You do, it does have half cover

4089
02:40:51.377 --> 02:40:53.465
at that point there, unfortunately.

4090
02:40:53.465 --> 02:40:54.473
TRAVIS: Oh, son of a bitch.

4091
02:40:54.473 --> 02:40:56.763
MATT: Unless you want to leap down and try and get there.

4092
02:40:56.763 --> 02:40:58.782
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me.

4093
02:40:58.782 --> 02:40:59.659
TRAVIS: Oh.

4094
02:40:59.659 --> 02:41:02.361
LAURA: In the water.

4095
02:41:02.361 --> 02:41:04.014
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

4096
02:41:04.014 --> 02:41:05.912
(cheering)

4097
02:41:05.912 --> 02:41:07.503
MATT: Three point landing.

4098
02:41:07.503 --> 02:41:10.094
TRAVIS: Finally! Can't be badass without it.

4099
02:41:10.094 --> 02:41:12.065
MATT: Landing right behind Caleb--

4100
02:41:12.065 --> 02:41:15.307
TRAVIS: Five-foot drop.
MATT: Yep.

4101
02:41:15.307 --> 02:41:19.353
TRAVIS: (thudding) You see that?

4102
02:41:19.353 --> 02:41:22.436
MATT: It's a little higher than that.
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast!

4103
02:41:22.436 --> 02:41:24.353
MATT: Roll two attacks.

4104
02:41:25.268 --> 02:41:27.054
TRAVIS: 23.
MATT: Hits.

4105
02:41:27.054 --> 02:41:28.126
LAURA: You get advantage.

4106
02:41:28.126 --> 02:41:29.121
TRAVIS: Oh, I do?

4107
02:41:29.121 --> 02:41:31.671
ASHLEY: Yeah, because the next person who hits.

4108
02:41:31.671 --> 02:41:32.504
TRAVIS: Awesome.

4109
02:41:32.504 --> 02:41:34.929
Fuck that one, it's a natural one.

4110
02:41:34.929 --> 02:41:37.412
The second one is--

4111
02:41:37.412 --> 02:41:38.787
TRAVIS and MARISHA: What the fuck?!

4112
02:41:38.787 --> 02:41:40.520
TRAVIS: 28 to hit.

4113
02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:43.870
MATT: 28 to hit, all right those both hit. Roll damage.

4114
02:41:43.870 --> 02:41:45.624
MARISHA: So many ones over here.

4115
02:41:45.624 --> 02:41:49.126
TRAVIS: Oh, 15 points of Eldritch on the first,

4116
02:41:49.126 --> 02:41:51.231
and 12 points on the second!

4117
02:41:52.106 --> 02:41:55.410
MATT: Nice!
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yee-haw!

4118
02:41:55.410 --> 02:41:58.438
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Well hell!

4119
02:41:58.438 --> 02:42:00.800
MATT: The green glow of the Eldritch energy

4120
02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:03.863
comes rocketing through the hallway.

4121
02:42:03.863 --> 02:42:07.128
As it does, one slams into its left elbow,

4122
02:42:07.128 --> 02:42:09.912
and the bone splinters and part of it hangs,

4123
02:42:09.912 --> 02:42:12.033
semi-useless. The other one hits the shoulder

4124
02:42:12.033 --> 02:42:14.810
and a splinter of bone. The left arm

4125
02:42:14.810 --> 02:42:17.252
of the skeletal giant is destroyed,

4126
02:42:17.252 --> 02:42:21.066
and clatters to the ground in an explosion of bone shards.

4127
02:42:21.066 --> 02:42:22.362
TRAVIS: (blowing)

4128
02:42:22.362 --> 02:42:23.923
ASHLEY: Hey, the club is in the left arm,

4129
02:42:23.923 --> 02:42:25.519
so does the club fall off?

4130
02:42:25.519 --> 02:42:28.078
LIAM: The wildest ride in Nicodranas!

4131
02:42:28.078 --> 02:42:29.360
TRAVIS: I will smite you.

4132
02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:31.076
MARISHA: Heal the rift!

4133
02:42:32.396 --> 02:42:34.337
TRAVIS: Your kidney is exposed!

4134
02:42:34.337 --> 02:42:35.398
MARISHA: (groaning)

4135
02:42:35.398 --> 02:42:39.472
MATT: That finishes your go. Caduceus, you're up.

4136
02:42:39.472 --> 02:42:42.344
TALIESIN: I am going to do an old fashioned

4137
02:42:42.344 --> 02:42:45.068
Sacred Flame attack.

4138
02:42:45.068 --> 02:42:46.543
MATT: Does it get to make a concentration saving throw to

4139
02:42:46.543 --> 02:42:48.338
try to resist the effect?

4140
02:42:48.338 --> 02:42:50.296
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Which it makes, natural 19.

4141
02:42:50.296 --> 02:42:52.137
So it is no longer enfeebled.

4142
02:42:52.137 --> 02:42:54.370
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice.

4143
02:42:54.370 --> 02:42:59.370
In that case, I'm going to cast Bane on him instead.

4144
02:42:59.565 --> 02:43:02.648
TRAVIS: Oh, I love when you use Bane, baby.

4145
02:43:03.671 --> 02:43:04.751
TALIESIN: That's a charisma save.

4146
02:43:04.751 --> 02:43:05.917
MATT: That is.

4147
02:43:05.917 --> 02:43:08.110
TRAVIS: (like Bane) Oh, you think you're--

4148
02:43:08.110 --> 02:43:09.852
MATT: That's going to be a 13.

4149
02:43:09.852 --> 02:43:14.852
TALIESIN: Nope. That's a d4 against attacks and saves.

4150
02:43:15.036 --> 02:43:16.681
LIAM: What is wrong with us tonight?

4151
02:43:16.681 --> 02:43:19.945
MARISHA: It's been a long week.

4152
02:43:19.945 --> 02:43:21.503
TRAVIS: (muffled) And a small fry?

4153
02:43:21.503 --> 02:43:25.102
TALIESIN: With that, I'm going to turn invisible.

4154
02:43:25.102 --> 02:43:28.292
SAM: Ooh, you can do that? Oh yes, you can do that.

4155
02:43:28.292 --> 02:43:30.274
MATT: Bane and you are invisible.

4156
02:43:30.274 --> 02:43:34.961
TALIESIN: I'm going to move, still I'm not going to break,

4157
02:43:34.961 --> 02:43:37.775
I'm not going to leave his point,

4158
02:43:37.775 --> 02:43:41.519
but I'm going to move further away and change my, like--

4159
02:43:41.519 --> 02:43:42.601
MATT: Where do you want to go?

4160
02:43:42.601 --> 02:43:44.819
TALIESIN: Like here.

4161
02:43:44.819 --> 02:43:45.860
Yeah, I want to be right behind him,

4162
02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:47.471
I want to be, yeah. He'll have to--

4163
02:43:47.471 --> 02:43:48.636
I want to help flank.

4164
02:43:48.636 --> 02:43:50.525
MATT: You got it.

4165
02:43:50.525 --> 02:43:53.663
That finishes your turn.

4166
02:43:53.663 --> 02:43:58.223
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I can't bonus action heal, can I?

4167
02:43:58.223 --> 02:43:59.903
MATT: Not if you cast Bane.

4168
02:43:59.903 --> 02:44:00.849
TALIESIN: Nevermind.

4169
02:44:00.849 --> 02:44:03.406
MATT: That brings us to Nott. What you doing, buddy?

4170
02:44:03.406 --> 02:44:06.143
SAM: I'll continue to run away and as I run,

4171
02:44:06.143 --> 02:44:10.728
I will fire a shot of the crossbow,

4172
02:44:10.728 --> 02:44:12.347
Tinkertop Boltblaster at it.

4173
02:44:12.347 --> 02:44:13.572
MATT: Go for it.

4174
02:44:15.335 --> 02:44:16.918
SAM: 12 plus 10 is 22.

4175
02:44:17.817 --> 02:44:19.154
MATT: 22 hits.

4176
02:44:19.154 --> 02:44:21.241
SAM: Is that sneak attack?

4177
02:44:21.241 --> 02:44:22.859
MATT: Currently no, because none of your friends

4178
02:44:22.859 --> 02:44:26.232
are engaged with it. Caduceus got out of combat with it.

4179
02:44:26.232 --> 02:44:27.410
TALIESIN: I'm still in combat range with it, aren't I?

4180
02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:29.750
MATT: You're within its combat range, but

4181
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:31.154
it is not within your combat range.

4182
02:44:31.154 --> 02:44:32.594
LIAM: Does the claw on its face count?

4183
02:44:32.594 --> 02:44:35.002
MATT: It is not technically an ally.

4184
02:44:35.002 --> 02:44:36.861
SAM: Well then, fuck.

4185
02:44:37.938 --> 02:44:39.868
That'll be 11 points, anyway.

4186
02:44:39.868 --> 02:44:41.417
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty.

4187
02:44:41.417 --> 02:44:43.084
SAM: I'll keep running.

4188
02:44:43.084 --> 02:44:44.812
MATT: Are you disengaging?

4189
02:44:44.812 --> 02:44:46.361
SAM: Was I in combat range?

4190
02:44:46.361 --> 02:44:47.740
MATT: Within its combat range.

4191
02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:48.796
SAM: Oh, boy.

4192
02:44:48.796 --> 02:44:53.570
Then yes, I will bonus action disengage and keep running.

4193
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:55.755
MATT: 30, 35. That's your movement there.

4194
02:44:55.755 --> 02:44:57.065
SAM: Bye-bye Yasha!

4195
02:44:57.065 --> 02:44:58.120
LIAM: Serpentine, serpentine!

4196
02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:00.120
SAM and ASHLEY: Goodbye!

4197
02:45:01.721 --> 02:45:04.011
MATT: All righty, that finish your turn, Nott?

4198
02:45:04.011 --> 02:45:04.937
SAM: That's it, that's all I got.

4199
02:45:04.937 --> 02:45:09.497
MATT: Beau, you're up, Jester, you're on deck.

4200
02:45:09.497 --> 02:45:12.806
MARISHA: I'm real far away

4201
02:45:12.806 --> 02:45:16.764
with no more ranged stuff.

4202
02:45:16.764 --> 02:45:19.679
I think these guys got it, so I'm going to get up

4203
02:45:19.679 --> 02:45:21.129
and I'm going to walk down the stairs

4204
02:45:21.129 --> 02:45:23.212
with all of my notebooks.

4205
02:45:24.502 --> 02:45:27.071
I'm going to go next to Caleb, and I'm going to go: Caleb!

4206
02:45:27.071 --> 02:45:30.837
Caleb, all these rifts are coming through the--

4207
02:45:31.787 --> 02:45:33.768
All these rifts are coming through the Abyss.

4208
02:45:33.768 --> 02:45:35.820
I'm wondering if there's like a mass invasion

4209
02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:37.739
and we should actually be, because see look--

4210
02:45:37.739 --> 02:45:38.572
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you doing?

4211
02:45:38.572 --> 02:45:39.743
MARISHA: They've got it.

4212
02:45:39.743 --> 02:45:43.302
Look, I think if we try and get like--

4213
02:45:43.302 --> 02:45:46.502
and then that's my turn.
LAURA: Guiding Bolt!

4214
02:45:46.502 --> 02:45:47.785
MATT: All righty, go for it.

4215
02:45:47.785 --> 02:45:50.035
(laughter)

4216
02:45:53.789 --> 02:45:55.631
LAURA: That's 12.

4217
02:45:58.599 --> 02:46:00.327
MATT: It explodes in the distance

4218
02:46:00.327 --> 02:46:02.103
on the far wall of the fortress.

4219
02:46:02.103 --> 02:46:03.254
SAM: Jail's getting full.

4220
02:46:03.254 --> 02:46:05.470
LAURA: Yep, yeah, it is. Jail's real full tonight.

4221
02:46:05.470 --> 02:46:07.588
MATT: I'm sorry. Do you want to move or stay put?

4222
02:46:07.588 --> 02:46:10.478
LAURA: Fuck that, I'm staying right where I fucking am!

4223
02:46:10.478 --> 02:46:12.110
MATT: There you fucking go.

4224
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:14.818
TALIESIN: Help, help!

4225
02:46:14.818 --> 02:46:16.680
LAURA: I'm trying.

4226
02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:17.966
SAM: You're invisible.

4227
02:46:17.966 --> 02:46:21.313
TALIESIN: We're assuming they can't see, but yeah.

4228
02:46:21.313 --> 02:46:22.778
TRAVIS: His brains crawled out of his head.

4229
02:46:22.778 --> 02:46:26.558
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. I'm a little worried about some stuff.

4230
02:46:26.558 --> 02:46:28.968
LIAM: How high is the ceiling in this cave?

4231
02:46:28.968 --> 02:46:30.776
MATT: This cave, it depends.

4232
02:46:30.776 --> 02:46:35.367
In the hallway, it's about 25 feet.

4233
02:46:35.367 --> 02:46:38.172
In certain chambers in here, it's about 30 or 35, depending.

4234
02:46:38.172 --> 02:46:41.617
It's rough, it's not very well cut on the ceiling.

4235
02:46:41.617 --> 02:46:43.192
It's...

4236
02:46:47.258 --> 02:46:49.550
Yeah, no, it has no idea where Caduceus is.

4237
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:52.675
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice! Thank god.

4238
02:46:54.047 --> 02:46:58.431
MATT: It's instead going to turn up to here

4239
02:46:58.431 --> 02:47:02.148
and it's going to attack you twice.

4240
02:47:02.148 --> 02:47:03.681
ASHLEY: Does he get an attack of opportunity

4241
02:47:03.681 --> 02:47:04.849
with the kitties?

4242
02:47:04.849 --> 02:47:05.725
LIAM: Probably not.

4243
02:47:05.725 --> 02:47:08.139
MATT: Hmm&gt; No, it does not have reactions.

4244
02:47:08.139 --> 02:47:09.409
TALIESIN: I'm holding mine, anyways.

4245
02:47:09.409 --> 02:47:11.748
MATT: Well, you weren't even melee with it.

4246
02:47:11.748 --> 02:47:13.153
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right, nevermind.

4247
02:47:13.153 --> 02:47:15.441
MATT: Two attacks against you.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4248
02:47:15.441 --> 02:47:16.560
MATT: It's a natural 19.

4249
02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:18.159
LAURA: Bane! Aren't you going to minus four?

4250
02:47:18.159 --> 02:47:20.858
TALIESIN: Minus four!
MATT: Oh, minus d4.

4251
02:47:20.858 --> 02:47:22.524
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter.
ASHLEY: It still hits.

4252
02:47:22.524 --> 02:47:24.594
MATT: Okay, minus one.

4253
02:47:24.594 --> 02:47:28.594
Yeah, that would be a 26.

4254
02:47:29.652 --> 02:47:34.652
A second attack, it's going to be a 18.

4255
02:47:35.495 --> 02:47:36.328
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

4256
02:47:36.328 --> 02:47:37.763
MATT: All right.

4257
02:47:37.763 --> 02:47:40.964
It comes down with you. You are not raging

4258
02:47:40.964 --> 02:47:44.339
because you did not do that last time you were in combat.

4259
02:47:44.339 --> 02:47:45.470
So the first hit.

4260
02:47:45.470 --> 02:47:48.945
ASHLEY: Dammit, I'm a dumb, dumb.

4261
02:47:48.945 --> 02:47:50.567
TALIESIN: Getting you back and such.

4262
02:47:50.567 --> 02:47:51.985
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage.

4263
02:47:51.985 --> 02:47:52.823
ASHLEY: Kay.

4264
02:47:52.823 --> 02:47:54.839
MATT: Whack! Right across the side of the face and shoulder

4265
02:47:54.839 --> 02:47:57.396
as you get pushed up against the rocks,

4266
02:47:57.396 --> 02:47:58.644
and then it comes down and it's going to try

4267
02:47:58.644 --> 02:48:00.468
and jam it like a brick into your face.

4268
02:48:00.468 --> 02:48:01.301
ASHLEY: Okay.

4269
02:48:01.301 --> 02:48:03.025
MATT: A brick that's the size of your body.

4270
02:48:03.025 --> 02:48:05.224
ASHLEY: Sure.
TRAVIS: Yep, okay.

4271
02:48:06.119 --> 02:48:10.340
MATT: That's, oh, 29 points of bludgeoning damage.

4272
02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:12.223
ASHLEY: Okay!

4273
02:48:13.245 --> 02:48:15.613
MATT: (thudding) and then (crashing).

4274
02:48:15.613 --> 02:48:18.861
You guys watch as Yasha gets jammed into the ground,

4275
02:48:18.861 --> 02:48:21.680
her arms being thrown up from the impact

4276
02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:23.371
before she pushes back up (grunting)

4277
02:48:23.371 --> 02:48:26.013
and shoves this large piece of partially carved stone

4278
02:48:26.013 --> 02:48:28.930
off her body, blood pouring down the back of the shoulder,

4279
02:48:28.930 --> 02:48:31.907
she's still holding Magician's Judge at the side.

4280
02:48:31.907 --> 02:48:34.593
ASHLEY: I didn't do it.

4281
02:48:34.593 --> 02:48:38.056
I even have it to remember, I didn't do it.

4282
02:48:38.056 --> 02:48:39.689
MATT: I know.
ASHLEY: That's okay.

4283
02:48:39.689 --> 02:48:42.131
MATT: It's going to also, after doing that,

4284
02:48:42.131 --> 02:48:45.635
looking towards you, the rest of its skull peels open,

4285
02:48:45.635 --> 02:48:47.816
and the rest of its brain

4286
02:48:47.816 --> 02:48:50.788
slops onto the ground and splatters.

4287
02:48:50.788 --> 02:48:51.751
On the inside, you can see

4288
02:48:51.751 --> 02:48:55.510
this slightly decomposed brain stem

4289
02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:58.667
that sits there and quivers and shakes.

4290
02:48:58.667 --> 02:49:00.147
TRAVIS: Fuck, Matt!

4291
02:49:00.147 --> 02:49:01.564
LAURA: That's awesome.

4292
02:49:04.161 --> 02:49:06.467
MATT: Did you already make a save against this creature

4293
02:49:06.467 --> 02:49:07.971
in the last battle?

4294
02:49:07.971 --> 02:49:08.804
ASHLEY: The um?

4295
02:49:08.804 --> 02:49:09.830
MATT: The fear.

4296
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:11.789
ASHLEY: I don't know if I did.

4297
02:49:11.789 --> 02:49:13.613
SAM: They were all clumped together.

4298
02:49:13.613 --> 02:49:15.397
TRAVIS: No, she didn't.
SAM: Oh, she was not.

4299
02:49:15.397 --> 02:49:17.043
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw for me, if you don't mind.

4300
02:49:17.043 --> 02:49:18.592
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

4301
02:49:18.592 --> 02:49:21.603
Why do I feel like I have a special for that?

4302
02:49:21.603 --> 02:49:23.501
LAURA: Are you immune to fear?

4303
02:49:23.501 --> 02:49:24.334
ASHLEY: I don't think so,

4304
02:49:24.334 --> 02:49:26.404
but I feel like I just read that I have something.

4305
02:49:26.404 --> 02:49:29.274
TRAVIS: You can rage and it goes away.

4306
02:49:29.274 --> 02:49:32.209
MATT: No, that's berserker.

4307
02:49:32.209 --> 02:49:33.651
TRAVIS: Balls anus.

4308
02:49:34.695 --> 02:49:36.054
SAM: Balls anus?

4309
02:49:36.054 --> 02:49:36.887
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4310
02:49:36.887 --> 02:49:38.851
SAM: That's the possessive balls.

4311
02:49:38.851 --> 02:49:40.442
ASHLEY: 11.

4312
02:49:41.367 --> 02:49:42.392
MATT: Unfortunately.

4313
02:49:42.392 --> 02:49:44.642
ASHLEY: Don't put a circle on me!

4314
02:49:46.170 --> 02:49:48.023
MATT: The terrible image before you of

4315
02:49:48.023 --> 02:49:51.392
the head cracking open, the brain splattering catching you

4316
02:49:51.392 --> 02:49:52.496
after the pain you suffered

4317
02:49:52.496 --> 02:49:54.547
and seeing this weird tendril stem

4318
02:49:54.547 --> 02:49:56.886
going out in your direction,

4319
02:49:56.886 --> 02:50:00.186
this dark cold fear grips you on the inside of your heart

4320
02:50:00.186 --> 02:50:02.899
and your instinct is to run.

4321
02:50:02.899 --> 02:50:04.458
That finishes its turn.

4322
02:50:04.458 --> 02:50:05.456
Yasha, you're up.

4323
02:50:05.456 --> 02:50:07.158
ASHLEY: (screaming)

4324
02:50:07.158 --> 02:50:08.424
MATT: You can't move closer to it,

4325
02:50:08.424 --> 02:50:10.671
so you cannot get into melee.

4326
02:50:10.671 --> 02:50:14.000
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.

4327
02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:15.315
And--

4328
02:50:15.315 --> 02:50:17.429
MARISHA: Do you shake fear being raged, or no?

4329
02:50:17.429 --> 02:50:18.404
MATT: No, that's what a berserker can do.

4330
02:50:18.404 --> 02:50:19.493
MARISHA: Fuck.

4331
02:50:19.493 --> 02:50:23.576
ASHLEY: I would like to rage and I would like to maybe,

4332
02:50:25.214 --> 02:50:27.217
I'm going to see if this fucking works,

4333
02:50:27.217 --> 02:50:29.717
I am going to,

4334
02:50:32.143 --> 02:50:34.233
because I'm very scared,

4335
02:50:34.233 --> 02:50:37.650
I'm going to poof out my Necrotic Shroud

4336
02:50:37.650 --> 02:50:39.944
and see if maybe I can scare him back.

4337
02:50:39.944 --> 02:50:41.392
MATT: Okay, interesting.

4338
02:50:41.392 --> 02:50:44.434
TRAVIS: Good call. Limited people around, good call.

4339
02:50:44.434 --> 02:50:48.354
MATT: Frightened instinct, you (whooshing)

4340
02:50:48.354 --> 02:50:51.198
release your giant skeletal black necrotic wings

4341
02:50:51.198 --> 02:50:53.778
that span out to both sides of you,

4342
02:50:53.778 --> 02:50:56.300
the entirety of the center chamber, the light grows darker,

4343
02:50:56.300 --> 02:50:59.336
you seem to absorb the light in the vicinity.

4344
02:50:59.336 --> 02:51:01.340
After you finish that and you try

4345
02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:02.696
and stand your ground, the fear still grips your heart

4346
02:51:02.696 --> 02:51:06.409
and the creature goes, (cracking).

4347
02:51:06.409 --> 02:51:07.505
Doesn't seem affected, unfortunately.

4348
02:51:07.505 --> 02:51:08.636
LAURA: He's immune.

4349
02:51:08.636 --> 02:51:10.875
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, (reading) "Once on your turn,

4350
02:51:10.875 --> 02:51:12.202
"you can have one attack

4351
02:51:12.202 --> 02:51:16.986
"or spell deal nine points of extra necrotic damage

4352
02:51:16.986 --> 02:51:20.557
"to one target." So can I add that the next time I attack?

4353
02:51:20.557 --> 02:51:24.082
If I can shrug off the fear. Okay.

4354
02:51:24.082 --> 02:51:25.135
MATT: That ends your turn?

4355
02:51:25.135 --> 02:51:26.135
ASHLEY: Yes.

4356
02:51:27.306 --> 02:51:29.324
MATT: Make another save.
ASHLEY: I did so much.

4357
02:51:29.324 --> 02:51:30.157
I get another save?

4358
02:51:30.157 --> 02:51:30.991
ASHLEY: Come on, come on!

4359
02:51:30.991 --> 02:51:32.586
MATT: Make a wisdom save.
MARISHA: Big money!

4360
02:51:32.586 --> 02:51:34.412
ASHLEY and MATT: 14.

4361
02:51:34.412 --> 02:51:36.662
(cheering)

4362
02:51:38.749 --> 02:51:40.115
ASHLEY: Okay.

4363
02:51:40.115 --> 02:51:42.289
Your wings are out, you're like, "Shit."

4364
02:51:42.289 --> 02:51:43.599
You've taken a few heavy hits

4365
02:51:43.599 --> 02:51:45.952
and it's now looking at you (growling).

4366
02:51:45.952 --> 02:51:48.854
Its open skull torn, its jaw dangling,

4367
02:51:48.854 --> 02:51:51.108
the tongue lolling down.

4368
02:51:51.108 --> 02:51:52.260
Actually, there wouldn't be a tongue

4369
02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:53.665
because most of its flesh got eaten,

4370
02:51:53.665 --> 02:51:55.936
so it's this open, broken jaw, skull.

4371
02:51:55.936 --> 02:51:57.196
ASHLEY: Just a little tongue.

4372
02:51:57.196 --> 02:51:59.680
LAURA: And a little brain stem.
MATT: Little brain stem going pff.

4373
02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:01.013
ASHLEY: Hello.

4374
02:52:01.013 --> 02:52:03.411
MATT: Finishing that, Caleb, you're up.

4375
02:52:03.411 --> 02:52:05.091
LIAM: Okay, so for a bonus action

4376
02:52:05.091 --> 02:52:07.917
the claw is going to rake down the giant's face again.

4377
02:52:07.917 --> 02:52:10.317
MATT: Go for it.

4378
02:52:10.317 --> 02:52:12.624
MARISHA: Caleb, look at this diagram that I have, though.

4379
02:52:12.624 --> 02:52:14.953
LIAM: 14, that is 15 points of damage.

4380
02:52:14.953 --> 02:52:16.166
MATT: Did you roll to hit?

4381
02:52:16.166 --> 02:52:18.876
LIAM: Oh, I didn't roll to hit, I'm sorry.

4382
02:52:18.876 --> 02:52:21.760
11 plus, thank you, is 20.

4383
02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:23.872
MATT: 20 hits, yeah so, 15 points.

4384
02:52:23.872 --> 02:52:25.955
LIAM: For my action--

4385
02:52:27.574 --> 02:52:29.019
MATT: As each of these hunks are taken, you can see bits

4386
02:52:29.019 --> 02:52:29.964
of the giant's flesh,

4387
02:52:29.964 --> 02:52:32.536
or the bone continuing to break and splinter.

4388
02:52:32.536 --> 02:52:34.468
It's looking hurt.

4389
02:52:34.468 --> 02:52:37.682
LIAM: For my action, I am throwing a Fireball here.

4390
02:52:37.682 --> 02:52:38.515
MARISHA: Nice!

4391
02:52:38.515 --> 02:52:39.361
MATT: Okay.

4392
02:52:39.361 --> 02:52:41.611
LAURA: (coughing)

4393
02:52:42.985 --> 02:52:43.818
TALIESIN: Bless you.

4394
02:52:43.818 --> 02:52:45.304
LAURA: Thank you.

4395
02:52:45.304 --> 02:52:46.137
SAM: Oh boy.

4396
02:52:46.137 --> 02:52:48.280
MATT: Like, there.

4397
02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:49.113
LIAM: Yeah.

4398
02:52:50.187 --> 02:52:51.182
MARISHA: Are you hiding?

4399
02:52:51.182 --> 02:52:53.515
SAM: You going to hit Caduceusy?

4400
02:52:55.308 --> 02:52:57.131
TALIESIN: If it's high enough, it's only going to hit him.

4401
02:52:57.131 --> 02:52:57.964
MATT: It's a 20-foot radius

4402
02:52:57.964 --> 02:52:59.739
and the hall's about 25 feet high.

4403
02:52:59.739 --> 02:53:01.838
There is a way that, yeah, you can throw it and hit,

4404
02:53:01.838 --> 02:53:03.326
but you don't know where Caduceus is

4405
02:53:03.326 --> 02:53:04.936
because Caduceus is invisible.

4406
02:53:04.936 --> 02:53:09.057
I will say make a perception check for me.

4407
02:53:09.057 --> 02:53:12.282
TALIESIN: Pretty please.

4408
02:53:13.895 --> 02:53:14.750
LIAM: 17.

4409
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:19.750
MATT: I will say, knowing where Caduceus was,

4410
02:53:20.086 --> 02:53:22.663
and--ah, you're too far away.

4411
02:53:22.663 --> 02:53:25.654
LIAM: He was around here, which is why I aimed up there.

4412
02:53:25.654 --> 02:53:27.237
MATT: He was over here.

4413
02:53:28.426 --> 02:53:29.259
LIAM: Okay.

4414
02:53:29.259 --> 02:53:30.970
MATT: You just saw him turn invisible.

4415
02:53:30.970 --> 02:53:35.562
I'll put it this way: roll a d6, on a one to three.

4416
02:53:35.562 --> 02:53:36.395
No, I haven't seen it yet.

4417
02:53:36.395 --> 02:53:38.515
On a one to three, you hit Caduceus,

4418
02:53:38.515 --> 02:53:39.597
on a four to six--

4419
02:53:39.597 --> 02:53:41.057
LIAM: I don't hit him, five.

4420
02:53:41.057 --> 02:53:43.219
MATT: Five, nice, okay!

4421
02:53:43.219 --> 02:53:45.219
In a moment of going, "I'm...

4422
02:53:48.279 --> 02:53:49.487
"hoping that Caduceus was able to

4423
02:53:49.487 --> 02:53:50.320
"get himself out of the way,"

4424
02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:53.032
you launch the Fireball.

4425
02:53:53.032 --> 02:53:55.097
The explosion rocks the far end of the cavern,

4426
02:53:55.097 --> 02:53:58.422
blasting into the side of the giant's face.

4427
02:53:58.422 --> 02:54:00.209
TALIESIN: Does he have to roll to save?

4428
02:54:00.209 --> 02:54:02.226
MATT: He does.
TALIESIN: Negative d4.

4429
02:54:02.226 --> 02:54:03.059
MATT: Yeah, it won't even matter.

4430
02:54:03.059 --> 02:54:04.739
It rolled a natural three minus one

4431
02:54:04.739 --> 02:54:06.390
LIAM: 25 total fire damage.

4432
02:54:06.390 --> 02:54:08.180
MARISHA: Kill it!

4433
02:54:08.180 --> 02:54:09.583
MATT: How do you want to do this?

4434
02:54:09.583 --> 02:54:11.833
(cheering)

4435
02:54:12.690 --> 02:54:15.186
LIAM: The claw will grab it by the face

4436
02:54:15.186 --> 02:54:17.811
and drag it around looking at that wall,

4437
02:54:17.811 --> 02:54:20.274
and the last thing that it sees as its head gets yanked,

4438
02:54:20.274 --> 02:54:22.696
is (fire exploding).

4439
02:54:22.696 --> 02:54:25.039
MATT: You guys watch as there's a blast of light

4440
02:54:25.039 --> 02:54:27.113
and that flash of fire and explosion.

4441
02:54:27.113 --> 02:54:30.786
You can see the silhouette of the giant skeleton before

4442
02:54:30.786 --> 02:54:34.255
just (cracking) and scatters into hundreds of bone shards

4443
02:54:34.255 --> 02:54:36.269
that are thrown against the rocks.

4444
02:54:36.269 --> 02:54:38.754
You can hear them all scatter and toss

4445
02:54:38.754 --> 02:54:40.686
and skip across the stones of the hallway.

4446
02:54:40.686 --> 02:54:42.127
Yasha, it blasts into you

4447
02:54:42.127 --> 02:54:43.945
and you have to squint and pull back.

4448
02:54:43.945 --> 02:54:45.954
Even Jester and Nott back here,

4449
02:54:45.954 --> 02:54:47.993
you can see bits and pieces of blackened bone

4450
02:54:47.993 --> 02:54:50.646
rocket into the back

4451
02:54:50.646 --> 02:54:51.702
of your head and shoulders.

4452
02:54:51.702 --> 02:54:52.937
LAURA: Whoa.

4453
02:54:52.937 --> 02:54:55.348
MATT: But the giant is no longer.

4454
02:54:55.348 --> 02:54:56.681
MARISHA: I feel like this can't be a coincidence,

4455
02:54:56.681 --> 02:54:57.894
you know what I'm saying?

4456
02:54:57.894 --> 02:54:59.043
I feel like we should talk about this.

4457
02:54:59.043 --> 02:55:01.618
Right?

4458
02:55:01.618 --> 02:55:03.478
TRAVIS: (slapping)
MARISHA: Ugh!

4459
02:55:03.478 --> 02:55:05.019
SAM: The jellyfish is alive!

4460
02:55:05.019 --> 02:55:07.999
LIAM: (high-pitched) Hi everybody!

4461
02:55:07.999 --> 02:55:08.894
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

4462
02:55:08.894 --> 02:55:10.239
MATT: Caleb, does that end your turn?

4463
02:55:10.239 --> 02:55:11.081
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

4464
02:55:11.081 --> 02:55:13.286
MATT: That brings us to Fjord.

4465
02:55:13.286 --> 02:55:16.015
TRAVIS: Yeah, um.

4466
02:55:16.015 --> 02:55:17.958
TALIESIN: Does the Bane carry onto the jellyfish?

4467
02:55:17.958 --> 02:55:19.233
MATT: Technically, the Bane was cast on the

4468
02:55:19.233 --> 02:55:21.295
physical body of the giant.
LIAM: (high-pitched) Let's be friends!

4469
02:55:21.295 --> 02:55:22.697
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4470
02:55:22.697 --> 02:55:25.722
TRAVIS: Can I run around <i>le</i> pond

4471
02:55:25.722 --> 02:55:28.155
towards where Jester is?

4472
02:55:29.089 --> 02:55:30.274
MATT: Right there?

4473
02:55:30.274 --> 02:55:31.988
LAURA: Oh hi Fjord.

4474
02:55:31.988 --> 02:55:33.788
TRAVIS: Hey Jester. Eldritch Blast!

4475
02:55:33.788 --> 02:55:35.314
(laughter)

4476
02:55:35.314 --> 02:55:37.304
SAM: Oh, at the jellyfish.

4477
02:55:37.304 --> 02:55:39.299
TRAVIS: Do I roll advantage on these?
MATT: No.

4478
02:55:41.324 --> 02:55:42.841
SAM: (slurred) Eldritch Blast.

4479
02:55:42.841 --> 02:55:44.472
TRAVIS: Oh, 28!

4480
02:55:44.472 --> 02:55:45.305
MATT: That hits.

4481
02:55:45.305 --> 02:55:47.699
TRAVIS: Nice, second one, 15.
LIAM: Idris Elba!

4482
02:55:47.699 --> 02:55:48.731
MATT: 15 also hits.

4483
02:55:48.731 --> 02:55:49.656
TRAVIS: Oh great! Okay!

4484
02:55:49.656 --> 02:55:51.114
SAM: Can we get Idris Elba on the show

4485
02:55:51.114 --> 02:55:53.543
just to make that joke?

4486
02:55:53.543 --> 02:55:55.817
TRAVIS: That's cocked. That's less.

4487
02:55:55.817 --> 02:55:57.625
MARISHA: Elba Blast!

4488
02:55:57.625 --> 02:56:01.015
TRAVIS: That's nine points of force damage, and...

4489
02:56:02.830 --> 02:56:05.247
eight points of force damage. 17.

4490
02:56:11.407 --> 02:56:12.800
MATT: How do you want to do this, Fjord?

4491
02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:14.580
(cheering)

4492
02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:18.228
TRAVIS: I look over at Jester, ah doo-doo, no look.

4493
02:56:18.228 --> 02:56:19.774
LAURA: Oh, nice.

4494
02:56:19.774 --> 02:56:22.894
MATT: All you see as he looks at you is (blasting).

4495
02:56:22.894 --> 02:56:24.405
TALIESIN: Gross!

4496
02:56:24.405 --> 02:56:25.822
Oh, that's so gross.

4497
02:56:25.822 --> 02:56:27.070
TRAVIS: Killed the jellyfish.

4498
02:56:27.070 --> 02:56:28.152
TALIESIN: That was gross.

4499
02:56:28.152 --> 02:56:30.427
LAURA: Thanks, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

4500
02:56:30.427 --> 02:56:31.380
LIAM: Caduceus!

4501
02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:32.734
TALIESIN: That was gross, Fjord!

4502
02:56:32.734 --> 02:56:34.400
LIAM: He's okay.
TRAVIS: What?

4503
02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.489
I see this like invisible outline

4504
02:56:36.489 --> 02:56:38.292
with splatter on it?

4505
02:56:38.292 --> 02:56:39.125
MATT: You look over in the area

4506
02:56:39.125 --> 02:56:43.320
and you can see this Caduceus form that's invisible,

4507
02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:46.209
but covered in semi-translucent blue goo.

4508
02:56:46.209 --> 02:56:48.587
Then (whooshing) he appears in the space.

4509
02:56:48.587 --> 02:56:50.315
TRAVIS: Ah, oh, sorry man.

4510
02:56:50.315 --> 02:56:53.230
MARISHA: That's a weird analogy for your romance

4511
02:56:53.230 --> 02:56:54.683
considering the context.

4512
02:56:54.683 --> 02:56:55.797
LAURA: You guys, we really need to take a rest here.

4513
02:56:55.797 --> 02:56:57.338
ASHLEY: I'm going to drop Necrotic Shroud.

4514
02:56:57.338 --> 02:57:00.397
SAM: How do we that? They can still attack us, it seems?

4515
02:57:00.397 --> 02:57:01.969
LAURA: Maybe we all go under the dome

4516
02:57:01.969 --> 02:57:04.106
and then if anything comes out we deal with it

4517
02:57:04.106 --> 02:57:06.013
after we take a sleep.

4518
02:57:06.013 --> 02:57:08.038
MARISHA: The dome's gone.

4519
02:57:08.038 --> 02:57:08.871
SAM: What?

4520
02:57:08.871 --> 02:57:10.321
TRAVIS: Caleb dropped the dome.

4521
02:57:10.321 --> 02:57:11.629
MARISHA: I run back upstairs

4522
02:57:11.629 --> 02:57:13.004
and look to see if I see the rift.

4523
02:57:13.004 --> 02:57:15.166
MATT: Make a perception check.

4524
02:57:16.455 --> 02:57:18.567
MARISHA: What the--why? Seven,

4525
02:57:18.567 --> 02:57:21.361
but I can see like a hole in the ceiling, right?

4526
02:57:21.361 --> 02:57:23.473
MATT: You glance where you saw it earlier

4527
02:57:23.473 --> 02:57:25.994
and it takes you a while to check it, essentially.

4528
02:57:25.994 --> 02:57:29.869
During that time, while you're looking.

4529
02:57:29.869 --> 02:57:33.036
MARISHA: Got to get my eyes checked, you guys.

4530
02:57:34.071 --> 02:57:35.066
MATT: The rift is gone.

4531
02:57:35.066 --> 02:57:38.461
SAM: The rift is gone!
MARISHA: Oh, the rift's gone!

4532
02:57:38.461 --> 02:57:40.369
TRAVIS: So it does?

4533
02:57:40.369 --> 02:57:43.152
SAM: (yelling) Rift killer!

4534
02:57:43.152 --> 02:57:45.284
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4535
02:57:45.284 --> 02:57:46.117
SAM: Wow!

4536
02:57:48.217 --> 02:57:50.695
SAM: This was a crazy side quest.

4537
02:57:50.695 --> 02:57:54.170
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast some light,

4538
02:57:54.170 --> 02:57:57.412
and man, I'm going to cast one more,

4539
02:57:57.412 --> 02:57:58.912
We're going to heal a little bit.

4540
02:57:58.912 --> 02:58:00.062
I'm going to cast some Daylight,

4541
02:58:00.062 --> 02:58:02.321
and we are going to thoroughly check this place

4542
02:58:02.321 --> 02:58:04.680
one more time, because I'm so tired.

4543
02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:08.269
MARISHA: Nott, can I see that thing that you shot through?

4544
02:58:08.269 --> 02:58:09.722
SAM: Here, it's a circle.

4545
02:58:09.722 --> 02:58:12.337
MARISHA: I compare it to my sketch that I drew,

4546
02:58:12.337 --> 02:58:13.559
the notes of the other one--

4547
02:58:13.559 --> 02:58:14.939
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4548
02:58:14.939 --> 02:58:15.962
TRAVIS: Your sketches suck.

4549
02:58:15.962 --> 02:58:17.703
LAURA: Yeah, your sketch is shit.

4550
02:58:17.703 --> 02:58:19.130
It looks like an egg or something.

4551
02:58:19.130 --> 02:58:21.095
What is that supposed to be?

4552
02:58:21.095 --> 02:58:22.913
MARISHA: That's not true, it looks like an anus,

4553
02:58:22.913 --> 02:58:26.669
but that's not--that's what it looks like.

4554
02:58:26.669 --> 02:58:30.669
I did draw a sketch of it, this is a true story.

4555
02:58:32.216 --> 02:58:34.491
TALIESIN: I'm going to take ten minutes

4556
02:58:34.491 --> 02:58:36.118
to do Mass Healing Word.

4557
02:58:36.118 --> 02:58:36.951
MATT: Okay.

4558
02:58:39.821 --> 02:58:41.261
MARISHA: 23.

4559
02:58:41.261 --> 02:58:42.977
TALIESIN: Who wants a Mass Healing Word, really quickly?

4560
02:58:42.977 --> 02:58:44.546
TRAVIS: (like Mario) It's a-me!

4561
02:58:44.546 --> 02:58:45.761
LAURA: Oh, no, I'm good.

4562
02:58:45.761 --> 02:58:47.896
(laughter)

4563
02:58:47.896 --> 02:58:49.079
MARISHA: I'll take healing.

4564
02:58:49.079 --> 02:58:50.442
MATT: That's the best Mario impression I've ever heard.

4565
02:58:50.442 --> 02:58:52.877
TALIESIN: All right.

4566
02:58:52.877 --> 02:58:55.971
Anybody who wants to take a little bit of a--

4567
02:58:55.971 --> 02:58:57.364
LIAM: Yeah, over here.

4568
02:58:57.364 --> 02:58:59.647
TALIESIN: How many people can I do?

4569
02:58:59.647 --> 02:59:02.995
This is a six creature spell.

4570
02:59:02.995 --> 02:59:05.883
So five people, who needs, you need one?

4571
02:59:05.883 --> 02:59:07.716
One, two, three, four.

4572
02:59:08.621 --> 02:59:10.287
ASHLEY: Do you?
TALIESIN: I do.

4573
02:59:10.287 --> 02:59:12.004
I've got the sixth, so.

4574
02:59:12.004 --> 02:59:12.837
SAM: Sure.

4575
02:59:12.837 --> 02:59:17.837
TALIESIN: Okay, everyone gets (blows raspberry)

4576
02:59:17.969 --> 02:59:21.101
six points of healing.

4577
02:59:21.101 --> 02:59:22.332
MARISHA: That's something!

4578
02:59:22.332 --> 02:59:23.165
LAURA: How many?

4579
02:59:23.165 --> 02:59:23.998
TALIESIN: Six.

4580
02:59:23.998 --> 02:59:25.031
SAM: Woo!

4581
02:59:25.031 --> 02:59:27.364
TRAVIS: Six-six-six!

4582
02:59:29.194 --> 02:59:30.327
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm a little better.

4583
02:59:30.327 --> 02:59:31.597
I'm going to use Daylight spell

4584
02:59:31.597 --> 02:59:34.189
and try and get a couple people together

4585
02:59:34.189 --> 02:59:36.224
and give this place a thorough once over.

4586
02:59:36.224 --> 02:59:37.124
MATT: Okay, while that's happening,

4587
02:59:37.124 --> 02:59:37.957
you rolled a what on your investigation?

4588
02:59:37.957 --> 02:59:38.948
MARISHA: 23.

4589
02:59:38.948 --> 02:59:40.481
MATT: Looking over your sketch

4590
02:59:40.481 --> 02:59:43.268
and this device that you found,

4591
02:59:43.268 --> 02:59:47.209
it's nearly identical in construction.

4592
02:59:47.209 --> 02:59:49.137
Other than the fact that the one that you had delivered

4593
02:59:49.137 --> 02:59:51.164
was intact, it was not broken

4594
02:59:51.164 --> 02:59:54.141
when you handed it over in Asarius.

4595
02:59:54.141 --> 02:59:55.915
This one, the center piece is shattered outward

4596
02:59:55.915 --> 02:59:57.998
and it is not functional.

4597
03:00:00.949 --> 03:00:03.162
Also, you notice, in one of the coils,

4598
03:00:03.162 --> 03:00:07.187
a tiny little swatch of torn fabric.

4599
03:00:07.187 --> 03:00:08.475
SAM: Oh, a clue!

4600
03:00:08.475 --> 03:00:09.735
MATT: Like a very,

4601
03:00:09.735 --> 03:00:11.985
very nice quality

4602
03:00:13.514 --> 03:00:16.845
dark blue wool material,

4603
03:00:16.845 --> 03:00:18.418
about that big.

4604
03:00:18.418 --> 03:00:20.154
TRAVIS: Dark. Blue. Wool.

4605
03:00:20.154 --> 03:00:21.961
Fuck a duck.

4606
03:00:21.961 --> 03:00:23.575
SAM: Who's that, who's that?

4607
03:00:23.575 --> 03:00:25.194
My memory's not working, who is that?

4608
03:00:25.194 --> 03:00:26.957
Is that your friend, is that your spy friend?

4609
03:00:26.957 --> 03:00:28.765
MARISHA: No. Look, there's a lot of people

4610
03:00:28.765 --> 03:00:30.031
who wear blue wool, okay?

4611
03:00:30.031 --> 03:00:32.296
Indigo is a very common color!

4612
03:00:32.296 --> 03:00:35.527
SAM: What color does your spy friend wear?

4613
03:00:35.527 --> 03:00:36.590
MARISHA: (shouting) Blue!

4614
03:00:36.590 --> 03:00:38.273
SAM: Your friend--

4615
03:00:38.273 --> 03:00:42.042
LIAM: Is it the same color that the woman wore that day?

4616
03:00:42.042 --> 03:00:43.601
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

4617
03:00:43.601 --> 03:00:45.018
TALIESIN: I mean, it is a uniform.

4618
03:00:45.018 --> 03:00:46.498
SAM: I don't know what, this is bad.

4619
03:00:46.498 --> 03:00:48.640
LIAM: Natural one.

4620
03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:51.655
MARISHA: I take it and I hold it up to my belt.

4621
03:00:51.655 --> 03:00:54.967
MATT: It's a deeper blue than your belt color.

4622
03:00:54.967 --> 03:00:56.263
SAM: She was innocent the whole time.

4623
03:00:56.263 --> 03:00:57.832
MATT: There are many shades of blue--

4624
03:00:57.832 --> 03:00:58.986
TRAVIS: You've been out in the sun too much,

4625
03:00:58.986 --> 03:00:59.819
that shit is faded!

4626
03:00:59.819 --> 03:01:04.049
MATT: All you know is it's blue wool material.

4627
03:01:04.049 --> 03:01:04.882
It is well-made,

4628
03:01:04.882 --> 03:01:07.612
based on the little bit of texture that is there,

4629
03:01:07.612 --> 03:01:09.630
it isn't a general or,

4630
03:01:09.630 --> 03:01:12.032
this is like a very fine thread count.

4631
03:01:12.032 --> 03:01:13.757
TALIESIN: I was going to say, can we get a thread count?

4632
03:01:13.757 --> 03:01:14.957
300?

4633
03:01:14.957 --> 03:01:16.478
LAURA: I'm going to feel the swatch.

4634
03:01:16.478 --> 03:01:19.886
Hm, yes, yes, would I know the dress maker

4635
03:01:19.886 --> 03:01:21.420
or clothing maker?
TRAVIS: Jesus.

4636
03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:23.843
(laughter)

4637
03:01:23.843 --> 03:01:25.442
MARISHA: Legally Blonde this shit.

4638
03:01:25.442 --> 03:01:27.901
MATT: Make a history check.

4639
03:01:27.901 --> 03:01:30.901
TRAVIS: Oh my god. (like Jester) My Pinterest page says--

4640
03:01:32.344 --> 03:01:33.177
LAURA: Oh, 14.

4641
03:01:33.177 --> 03:01:34.219
MATT: 14.

4642
03:01:34.219 --> 03:01:37.025
On the far off land--no, you have no idea.

4643
03:01:37.025 --> 03:01:38.788
LAURA: If it had been a 20, though.

4644
03:01:38.788 --> 03:01:39.979
MARISHA: We need Crit Role Closets

4645
03:01:39.979 --> 03:01:42.890
to refer to somebody's shirt it is.

4646
03:01:42.890 --> 03:01:43.900
LAURA: Hm.

4647
03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:45.124
(sniffing)

4648
03:01:45.124 --> 03:01:46.193
Does it smell like anything?

4649
03:01:46.193 --> 03:01:49.217
MATT: It smells like a lot of rotting flesh.

4650
03:01:49.217 --> 03:01:50.644
LAURA: Ew.

4651
03:01:50.644 --> 03:01:52.804
MATT: And currently bits of charcoal.

4652
03:01:52.804 --> 03:01:57.262
TALIESIN: I'm also going to grab the skull

4653
03:01:57.262 --> 03:02:00.747
of that little goblin

4654
03:02:00.747 --> 03:02:01.795
and put it in my bag,

4655
03:02:01.795 --> 03:02:04.624
as much of it as I can, I'm going to get enough of it to.

4656
03:02:04.624 --> 03:02:07.542
MATT: The skull of the goblin is still intact, yeah.

4657
03:02:07.542 --> 03:02:09.859
TALIESIN: I'm also going to do the--

4658
03:02:09.859 --> 03:02:11.526
MATT: Are you getting more of the body, or just?

4659
03:02:11.526 --> 03:02:13.795
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a bit of it, as much as I can,

4660
03:02:13.795 --> 03:02:14.628
I'm also going to hit, just for fun,

4661
03:02:14.628 --> 03:02:15.461
I'm going to Spare the Dying--

4662
03:02:17.142 --> 03:02:19.299
oh, no, not Spare the Dying.

4663
03:02:19.299 --> 03:02:21.235
What's the one that fridges things?

4664
03:02:21.235 --> 03:02:23.280
Where's the fridge?

4665
03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:24.947
LIAM: Oh the--shoot, what's it called?

4666
03:02:24.947 --> 03:02:26.011
LAURA: Oh, uh--

4667
03:02:26.011 --> 03:02:26.997
TRAVIS: Nuked fridge.

4668
03:02:26.997 --> 03:02:27.830
MARISHA: Bag of colding.

4669
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:28.938
LIAM: Calm sleepiness.

4670
03:02:28.938 --> 03:02:31.613
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have a version of that, hold on.

4671
03:02:31.613 --> 03:02:32.717
MATT: Oh, Gentle Repose?

4672
03:02:32.717 --> 03:02:34.051
LIAM and LAURA: Yes.

4673
03:02:34.051 --> 03:02:35.869
TALIESIN: Do I have that left? I do.

4674
03:02:35.869 --> 03:02:37.011
MATT: It's not going to do much for a goblin

4675
03:02:37.011 --> 03:02:39.846
that's been burned to shit.

4676
03:02:39.846 --> 03:02:41.574
TALIESIN: I just don't want it to get any weirder.

4677
03:02:41.574 --> 03:02:42.940
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

4678
03:02:42.940 --> 03:02:44.323
SAM: Even though you already cast Decompose on it.

4679
03:02:44.323 --> 03:02:46.061
TALIESIN: Yeah, it'll hold.

4680
03:02:46.061 --> 03:02:46.937
That takes forever.

4681
03:02:46.937 --> 03:02:47.770
MATT: You can take the skull,

4682
03:02:47.770 --> 03:02:50.467
at this point it's burning and take most of the corpse,

4683
03:02:50.467 --> 03:02:51.571
it's up to you.

4684
03:02:51.571 --> 03:02:52.675
TALIESIN: I'll take most of it.

4685
03:02:52.675 --> 03:02:55.421
MATT: You have a charred goblin corpse in your inventory.

4686
03:02:55.421 --> 03:02:56.694
SAM: No, what are you doing with it?

4687
03:02:56.694 --> 03:02:58.409
TRAVIS: You mess around with chemicals and stuff, right?

4688
03:02:58.409 --> 03:02:59.242
SAM: I do!

4689
03:02:59.242 --> 03:03:00.377
TRAVIS: Your husband does as well?

4690
03:03:00.377 --> 03:03:01.590
SAM: Yes, he does.

4691
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:04.375
TRAVIS: Could you run some tests to see what sort of

4692
03:03:04.375 --> 03:03:08.668
elements or things this a-a-fabric has been around?

4693
03:03:08.668 --> 03:03:12.148
LAURA: What, why are you being weird, what's wrong with you?

4694
03:03:12.148 --> 03:03:13.818
TRAVIS: I don't know if you can tell like,

4695
03:03:13.818 --> 03:03:15.907
what it's been around, what like other chemicals

4696
03:03:15.907 --> 03:03:19.600
or you know, and test it for like skin flakes or you know.

4697
03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.211
LAURA: I'm going to look Fjord in the eyes.

4698
03:03:23.211 --> 03:03:24.557
TALIESIN: You can just ask it, you know.

4699
03:03:24.557 --> 03:03:25.411
LAURA: I'm going to look him in the eyes

4700
03:03:25.411 --> 03:03:27.366
and see if he's like possessed or something.

4701
03:03:27.366 --> 03:03:29.347
MATT: Okay, make an insight check.

4702
03:03:29.347 --> 03:03:32.705
MARISHA: (like Foghorn Leghorn) I say, I say.

4703
03:03:32.705 --> 03:03:33.845
LAURA: Oh!

4704
03:03:33.845 --> 03:03:35.347
ASHLEY: That was almost a natural 20.

4705
03:03:35.347 --> 03:03:37.014
LAURA: That was so close.

4706
03:03:38.698 --> 03:03:39.571
13.

4707
03:03:39.571 --> 03:03:43.516
MATT: 13. Best you can tell, Travis is just being weird.

4708
03:03:43.516 --> 03:03:44.995
LAURA: Okay.

4709
03:03:44.995 --> 03:03:48.465
SAM: Matthew, what uniforms have we seen

4710
03:03:48.465 --> 03:03:50.685
predominantly in the color blue

4711
03:03:50.685 --> 03:03:52.809
along our whole year-long journey?

4712
03:03:52.809 --> 03:03:55.507
LIAM: What color was that chair in that room?

4713
03:03:55.507 --> 03:03:58.757
MATT: You've seen many people wearing blue.

4714
03:03:59.721 --> 03:04:00.787
TALIESIN: It's a color.

4715
03:04:00.787 --> 03:04:03.043
MATT: It's a color that many people you've come across

4716
03:04:03.043 --> 03:04:04.893
in your life have worn.

4717
03:04:04.893 --> 03:04:06.477
Whether it be capes or pants,

4718
03:04:06.477 --> 03:04:08.672
or shirts, or blouses, or dresses--

4719
03:04:08.672 --> 03:04:09.824
SAM: How about the fabric.

4720
03:04:09.824 --> 03:04:12.249
How many people have we seen in the blue?

4721
03:04:12.249 --> 03:04:13.293
TALIESIN: Only a Ravenclaw.

4722
03:04:13.293 --> 03:04:17.276
LIAM: The killer is either Beau or Jester.

4723
03:04:17.276 --> 03:04:18.835
MATT: The plot thickens.

4724
03:04:18.835 --> 03:04:22.579
TRAVIS: I'll make my way over to Landspeaker Soorna and say:

4725
03:04:22.579 --> 03:04:25.677
I think we're all going to go to sleep for a spell,

4726
03:04:25.677 --> 03:04:27.465
I love a good bedtime story,

4727
03:04:27.465 --> 03:04:30.237
mind sharing what you do up in the room

4728
03:04:30.237 --> 03:04:32.877
with your mask and stuff?

4729
03:04:32.877 --> 03:04:37.689
MATT: She looks at you and goes, (speaking in Giant).

4730
03:04:37.689 --> 03:04:39.043
TRAVIS: Shit.

4731
03:04:39.043 --> 03:04:40.077
Caduceus!

4732
03:04:41.625 --> 03:04:42.887
TALIESIN: I can't hear, I'm at the whole other end of the--

4733
03:04:42.887 --> 03:04:44.391
MATT: That's true.

4734
03:04:44.391 --> 03:04:47.201
TRAVIS: (yelling) Caduceus!

4735
03:04:47.201 --> 03:04:50.468
I'll be <i>uno momento.</i>

4736
03:04:50.468 --> 03:04:52.330
TALIESIN: I'm making you do it.

4737
03:04:52.330 --> 03:04:53.731
All right, he can bring me over.

4738
03:04:53.731 --> 03:04:56.527
Hey, I think everything,

4739
03:04:56.527 --> 03:05:00.429
I get the feeling that everything is good.

4740
03:05:00.429 --> 03:05:03.418
I think we've taken care of it.

4741
03:05:03.418 --> 03:05:05.951
LAURA: Good. I sit down, against the wall.

4742
03:05:05.951 --> 03:05:07.642
TALIESIN: I would recommend taking a look around

4743
03:05:07.642 --> 03:05:09.986
and making sure that you feel everything is secure now.

4744
03:05:09.986 --> 03:05:11.252
MATT: "I will.

4745
03:05:12.318 --> 03:05:17.318
"It feels less dangerous."

4746
03:05:18.190 --> 03:05:21.866
TALIESIN: Is it okay if we may sleep here,

4747
03:05:21.866 --> 03:05:24.528
I don't know if, we should probably sleep here,

4748
03:05:24.528 --> 03:05:25.789
we're a little tired.

4749
03:05:25.789 --> 03:05:26.774
MATT: "Of course."

4750
03:05:26.774 --> 03:05:27.878
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4751
03:05:27.878 --> 03:05:29.899
MATT: The Landspeaker begins to do her own pass of the

4752
03:05:29.899 --> 03:05:33.206
interior, checking and rummaging through the bone pit,

4753
03:05:33.206 --> 03:05:35.942
going around different corners, rearranging some things

4754
03:05:35.942 --> 03:05:39.062
that were knocked over or damaged back into place.

4755
03:05:39.062 --> 03:05:40.730
MARISHA: What did you say the name of this cave was again,

4756
03:05:40.730 --> 03:05:41.771
what did they call this place?

4757
03:05:41.771 --> 03:05:44.100
MATT: They called it the Braan, B-R-A-A-N,

4758
03:05:44.100 --> 03:05:45.565
which is Giant for "the belly."

4759
03:05:45.565 --> 03:05:47.821
LIAM: I think Caleb and Frumpkin would go back upstairs

4760
03:05:47.821 --> 03:05:51.914
and I would begin to re-ritual cast the dome for us,

4761
03:05:51.914 --> 03:05:54.410
and the drift globe is floating in the room,

4762
03:05:54.410 --> 03:05:57.205
lighting the whole place up.

4763
03:05:57.205 --> 03:05:58.813
TALIESIN: Once she's satisfied, I would love,

4764
03:05:58.813 --> 03:06:01.501
if she feels like telling a story or otherwise,

4765
03:06:01.501 --> 03:06:03.744
because we're going to be bedding down for a while.

4766
03:06:03.744 --> 03:06:05.545
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4767
03:06:05.545 --> 03:06:08.378
As you guys all gather your things together,

4768
03:06:08.378 --> 03:06:10.262
closing and locking the front doors

4769
03:06:10.262 --> 03:06:13.034
to the interior of the Braan.

4770
03:06:13.034 --> 03:06:16.260
She goes and gathers some of the bedding arrangements

4771
03:06:16.260 --> 03:06:18.118
from the nearby beds. It's probably

4772
03:06:18.118 --> 03:06:20.998
from some of the giants that'll no longer be needing them,

4773
03:06:20.998 --> 03:06:24.096
and bundles up what is a relatively comfortable

4774
03:06:24.096 --> 03:06:28.836
series of batches, small piles of wool

4775
03:06:28.836 --> 03:06:30.836
and linens and leathers.

4776
03:06:31.754 --> 03:06:34.487
Sits and takes some incense and burns

4777
03:06:34.487 --> 03:06:36.487
and says a quiet prayer.

4778
03:06:38.269 --> 03:06:43.269
You guys take some of the elements of scattered wood

4779
03:06:43.355 --> 03:06:47.498
from the outside and build a small fire for warmth,

4780
03:06:47.498 --> 03:06:48.756
and as the night progresses

4781
03:06:48.756 --> 03:06:50.628
and you all gather around

4782
03:06:50.628 --> 03:06:54.660
to find a much earned evening of sleep,

4783
03:06:54.660 --> 03:06:58.596
the Landspeaker motions to you and.

4784
03:06:58.596 --> 03:07:01.501
TALIESIN: I'll speak for the others.

4785
03:07:01.501 --> 03:07:03.584
MATT: Begins to say,

4786
03:07:04.758 --> 03:07:09.441
"We are but one

4787
03:07:09.441 --> 03:07:14.441
in the mightier order of giant kin,

4788
03:07:14.454 --> 03:07:19.454
"but for us it is to be one with the mountains

4789
03:07:19.454 --> 03:07:24.454
"and let the spirits of the world

4790
03:07:24.854 --> 03:07:28.179
"and nature guide us in our dreams.

4791
03:07:28.179 --> 03:07:31.762
"I, as the Landspeaker, guide or...

4792
03:07:33.334 --> 03:07:34.486
"attempt to guide."

4793
03:07:34.486 --> 03:07:36.586
She looks around at like the

4794
03:07:36.586 --> 03:07:40.734
broken corpses that you've fought over the past day or so

4795
03:07:40.734 --> 03:07:45.734
and says, "It was my charge to protect them

4796
03:07:46.451 --> 03:07:49.534
"and I had not the vision to see this.

4797
03:07:51.814 --> 03:07:56.566
"The dreams are mine to interpret

4798
03:07:56.566 --> 03:08:01.450
"and that interpretation can take weeks.

4799
03:08:01.450 --> 03:08:03.825
"Months even.

4800
03:08:05.120 --> 03:08:08.936
"I see now I need to learn to do this

4801
03:08:08.936 --> 03:08:12.183
sooner.

4802
03:08:12.183 --> 03:08:16.674
"For there are images I've had of things

4803
03:08:16.674 --> 03:08:21.674
"that have come to pass that I only recognize in hindsight.

4804
03:08:21.827 --> 03:08:25.571
"If I could have helped and stopped them,"

4805
03:08:25.571 --> 03:08:29.949
and she gets a little quieter for a minute.

4806
03:08:29.949 --> 03:08:33.449
"But, nevertheless, it is

4807
03:08:34.419 --> 03:08:37.888
"through your aid

4808
03:08:37.888 --> 03:08:41.721
"that most of us live

4809
03:08:41.721 --> 03:08:44.930
"and have a home to return to.

4810
03:08:46.826 --> 03:08:49.159
"This will be remembered."

4811
03:08:51.864 --> 03:08:54.685
TALIESIN: It is through your wisdom and trust

4812
03:08:54.685 --> 03:08:59.652
that you have a home to protect again, don't forget that.

4813
03:09:04.490 --> 03:09:08.465
MATT: "The dreams can be hard to diskern.

4814
03:09:08.465 --> 03:09:11.616
"When they end, when they begin.

4815
03:09:11.616 --> 03:09:12.960
"There was a part of me that had hoped

4816
03:09:12.960 --> 03:09:16.106
"that all of this was but a dream.

4817
03:09:16.106 --> 03:09:20.781
"That us leaving and walking into

4818
03:09:20.781 --> 03:09:23.965
"the redwood,

4819
03:09:23.965 --> 03:09:27.876
"fighting the folk that you represent

4820
03:09:27.876 --> 03:09:30.515
"was in itself a dream,

4821
03:09:30.515 --> 03:09:35.515
"but I fear that is not something I can wake up from.

4822
03:09:35.603 --> 03:09:39.186
"I accept the deaths that we've suffered,

4823
03:09:40.055 --> 03:09:42.921
"as I accept the deaths that we've caused,

4824
03:09:42.921 --> 03:09:45.971
"and for that we are sorry.

4825
03:09:51.707 --> 03:09:55.999
"I hope in the agreements that we made,

4826
03:09:57.040 --> 03:09:59.707
"that you find this satisfactory."

4827
03:10:01.659 --> 03:10:03.928
LAURA: Landspeaker, can you ask her,

4828
03:10:03.928 --> 03:10:08.236
is it possible, do they have like,

4829
03:10:08.236 --> 03:10:11.953
a symbol or anything that we could take with us,

4830
03:10:11.953 --> 03:10:16.731
so that if we run into any other tribes or kinsmen,

4831
03:10:16.731 --> 03:10:19.648
that they will know we are friends?

4832
03:10:22.395 --> 03:10:25.312
MATT: "Giant kin doesn't work like that.

4833
03:10:26.365 --> 03:10:28.365
"We keep to our families.

4834
03:10:29.246 --> 03:10:34.246
"While we often dream of the same

4835
03:10:35.326 --> 03:10:36.909
"threads of history,

4836
03:10:38.780 --> 03:10:43.197
"there is tension from home to home.

4837
03:10:46.133 --> 03:10:48.966
"I wish I could help, but I cannot."

4838
03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:57.476
TALIESIN: We will most likely,

4839
03:10:57.476 --> 03:10:59.025
we will use our best judgment,

4840
03:10:59.025 --> 03:11:01.275
but I doubt that we will...

4841
03:11:04.147 --> 03:11:06.308
Put forward the details of what happened here

4842
03:11:06.308 --> 03:11:07.816
to the people involved.

4843
03:11:07.816 --> 03:11:10.232
Much like your people, we are not all

4844
03:11:10.232 --> 03:11:15.230
always on the same page and I would feel...

4845
03:11:16.593 --> 03:11:21.593
I would hesitate to secure the disposition

4846
03:11:22.353 --> 03:11:24.696
of the people who take back those mines,

4847
03:11:24.696 --> 03:11:28.613
but we will probably tell them that whatever...

4848
03:11:33.740 --> 03:11:36.865
numbers that you've lost today were probably due to us

4849
03:11:36.865 --> 03:11:39.111
and that you ran off into the hills

4850
03:11:39.111 --> 03:11:41.087
and never to be seen again,

4851
03:11:41.087 --> 03:11:42.651
if any of you survived at all,

4852
03:11:42.651 --> 03:11:47.234
so that they do not decide that our word is not enough.

4853
03:11:48.350 --> 03:11:49.576
I would rather have them feel

4854
03:11:49.576 --> 03:11:54.193
that they are smugly victorious when they are not,

4855
03:11:54.193 --> 03:11:55.611
unless you feel that this is too much

4856
03:11:55.611 --> 03:11:57.861
of an insult to your pride.

4857
03:11:59.643 --> 03:12:01.323
MATT: "You talk in confusing circles."

4858
03:12:01.323 --> 03:12:02.737
TALIESIN: I do.

4859
03:12:02.737 --> 03:12:06.154
MATT: "But I appreciate the gesture."

4860
03:12:07.060 --> 03:12:09.080
LAURA: That's my name!

4861
03:12:09.080 --> 03:12:11.299
TALIESIN: People are difficult and I want you to know

4862
03:12:11.299 --> 03:12:13.499
that we may embellish the truth of what happened

4863
03:12:13.499 --> 03:12:17.553
to make it seem perhaps that there was a conflict

4864
03:12:17.553 --> 03:12:20.200
and that we were very victorious against you,

4865
03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:23.073
so that they do not feel threatened by your existence

4866
03:12:23.073 --> 03:12:24.491
out in the woods.

4867
03:12:24.491 --> 03:12:26.985
MATT: "Do what you must to keep them from coming here."

4868
03:12:26.985 --> 03:12:28.350
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

4869
03:12:28.350 --> 03:12:29.350
MATT: "As while...

4870
03:12:30.980 --> 03:12:35.980
"my experience with your smaller clan,

4871
03:12:36.026 --> 03:12:38.934
"has been positive.

4872
03:12:38.934 --> 03:12:40.264
"It was the exception."

4873
03:12:40.264 --> 03:12:41.870
TALIESIN: I would agree.

4874
03:12:41.870 --> 03:12:46.870
MATT: "Should they come knocking at our gates once more,

4875
03:12:47.065 --> 03:12:48.760
"we will not greet them with open arms."

4876
03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:50.091
TALIESIN: I would hope not.

4877
03:12:50.091 --> 03:12:51.336
TRAVIS: Hey Caduceus.

4878
03:12:51.336 --> 03:12:53.581
Could you ask her two things for me?

4879
03:12:53.581 --> 03:12:54.414
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

4880
03:12:54.414 --> 03:12:57.105
TRAVIS: One, does she see any, like,

4881
03:12:57.105 --> 03:12:59.377
giant eyes in her dreams?

4882
03:12:59.377 --> 03:13:04.264
Two, did she ever see anyone, I don't know, like us,

4883
03:13:04.264 --> 03:13:07.033
sneak in and maybe deposit this device?

4884
03:13:07.033 --> 03:13:09.182
TALIESIN: Do you see any giant guys in your dream?

4885
03:13:09.182 --> 03:13:10.587
Big guys?

4886
03:13:10.587 --> 03:13:11.595
TRAVIS: Eyes!

4887
03:13:11.595 --> 03:13:13.768
I understood what you said in Giant.

4888
03:13:13.768 --> 03:13:16.435
TALIESIN: Yeah, I relay the information.

4889
03:13:17.713 --> 03:13:21.130
MATT: "I mean, there are many things with eyes."

4890
03:13:22.395 --> 03:13:27.320
TALIESIN: A piercing eye. One of our people dreams of eyes.

4891
03:13:28.609 --> 03:13:31.755
Deeply beneath the sea.

4892
03:13:31.755 --> 03:13:35.005
MATT: "The sea I know not much of."

4893
03:13:36.616 --> 03:13:41.616
TALIESIN: Do you see a kiln where things are forged?

4894
03:13:41.724 --> 03:13:46.641
Do you see a pool with animals?

4895
03:13:50.843 --> 03:13:53.193
MATT: "I cannot say I have."

4896
03:13:56.148 --> 03:13:58.872
TALIESIN: Would there be goblins who would have a reason

4897
03:13:58.872 --> 03:14:01.464
to turn against you?

4898
03:14:01.464 --> 03:14:04.392
MATT: "Not goblins in these mountains."

4899
03:14:04.392 --> 03:14:06.559
TALIESIN: But do you have enemies?

4900
03:14:07.729 --> 03:14:11.412
MATT: "We have enemies, all around us."

4901
03:14:11.412 --> 03:14:13.829
TALIESIN: Consistent ones, I suppose.

4902
03:14:15.373 --> 03:14:17.956
Clever ones.

4903
03:14:17.956 --> 03:14:20.456
We feel this was done to you.

4904
03:14:22.062 --> 03:14:24.812
MATT: "We've had a few encounters with

4905
03:14:26.762 --> 03:14:29.236
"the bugbears of the west

4906
03:14:29.236 --> 03:14:34.106
"that seem to clamber beneath the Spider Queen,

4907
03:14:34.106 --> 03:14:36.391
"but not in a decade."

4908
03:14:36.391 --> 03:14:37.224
TALIESIN: Oh.

4909
03:14:38.793 --> 03:14:41.806
Thank you. Thank you for sharing.

4910
03:14:41.806 --> 03:14:45.263
LAURA: What did she say, what did she say?

4911
03:14:45.263 --> 03:14:48.333
TALIESIN: Bugbears, Spider Queen, over a decade.

4912
03:14:48.333 --> 03:14:50.916
SAM: But that was a long time ago.

4913
03:14:51.891 --> 03:14:54.897
Should we talk to the--we can't talk to the dead goblin?

4914
03:14:54.897 --> 03:14:56.667
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can.
SAM: We can?

4915
03:14:56.667 --> 03:14:57.656
TALIESIN: Sure.
SAM: Right now?

4916
03:14:57.656 --> 03:14:59.272
TALIESIN: Not right now.

4917
03:14:59.272 --> 03:15:02.465
SAM: After we get some spells back.

4918
03:15:02.465 --> 03:15:06.756
TALIESIN: But yeah, I've got, I have some thoughts.

4919
03:15:06.756 --> 03:15:08.577
LAURA: Yeah, maybe the goblin saw somebody

4920
03:15:08.577 --> 03:15:10.628
put that disk down there or something.

4921
03:15:10.628 --> 03:15:13.667
SAM: Or the goblin put the thing down there.

4922
03:15:13.667 --> 03:15:15.403
LAURA: That goblin didn't have any blue clothes on,

4923
03:15:15.403 --> 03:15:17.092
you guys, this is crazy.

4924
03:15:17.092 --> 03:15:19.220
SAM: Well, we burned all the clothes off the goblin.

4925
03:15:19.220 --> 03:15:22.484
TALIESIN: I'll also add that, where did you find the fabric,

4926
03:15:22.484 --> 03:15:24.212
was it actually in the mechanism?

4927
03:15:24.212 --> 03:15:25.939
MARISHA: In the mechanism.

4928
03:15:25.939 --> 03:15:27.117
TALIESIN: If you can build something like that,

4929
03:15:27.117 --> 03:15:29.073
you're not going to be the one to deposit it

4930
03:15:29.073 --> 03:15:33.141
in a giant's cave. You're going to pay some poor--

4931
03:15:33.141 --> 03:15:36.043
MARISHA: Someone must have some sort of global reach.

4932
03:15:36.043 --> 03:15:39.044
We've now seen these places across the entire continent.

4933
03:15:39.044 --> 03:15:40.762
Thousands of miles apart.

4934
03:15:40.762 --> 03:15:43.485
TALIESIN: That's true.
SAM and LAURA: Thousands?

4935
03:15:43.485 --> 03:15:44.851
SAM: Didn't we just see two?

4936
03:15:44.851 --> 03:15:45.858
Have we seen one and two?

4937
03:15:45.858 --> 03:15:46.749
TALIESIN: Rifts.

4938
03:15:46.749 --> 03:15:49.549
MARISHA: We've closed three rifts, right?

4939
03:15:49.549 --> 03:15:51.037
MATT: Yes, but you've seen two of these devices.

4940
03:15:51.037 --> 03:15:52.546
MARISHA: Two of the devices,

4941
03:15:52.546 --> 03:15:54.253
which makes me wonder that first place,

4942
03:15:54.253 --> 03:15:57.745
which was in Stilben, or not Stilben--

4943
03:15:57.745 --> 03:15:58.596
MATT: Asarius.

4944
03:15:58.596 --> 03:16:01.150
MARISHA: Where was the first place we closed the rift?

4945
03:16:01.150 --> 03:16:02.916
TRAVIS: The well.

4946
03:16:02.916 --> 03:16:05.999
MATT: It was Asarius, The City of Beasts.

4947
03:16:06.922 --> 03:16:09.053
MARISHA: We closed three rifts, though, right?

4948
03:16:09.053 --> 03:16:11.278
MATT: Two of them were in the same city.

4949
03:16:11.278 --> 03:16:12.111
MARISHA: Oh.

4950
03:16:12.111 --> 03:16:13.694
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4951
03:16:14.707 --> 03:16:15.556
No, no.

4952
03:16:15.556 --> 03:16:17.559
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, I feel like there was something

4953
03:16:17.559 --> 03:16:18.951
but yeah, brain.

4954
03:16:18.951 --> 03:16:20.692
LAURA: I think Matt would know.

4955
03:16:20.692 --> 03:16:21.783
SAM: I don't.

4956
03:16:21.783 --> 03:16:23.366
TALIESIN: Would he?

4957
03:16:25.012 --> 03:16:26.740
MARISHA: But still.

4958
03:16:26.740 --> 03:16:29.186
SAM: They were far apart in two different cities.

4959
03:16:29.186 --> 03:16:32.176
We have a large operation.

4960
03:16:32.176 --> 03:16:34.493
TRAVIS: Someone's sowing unrest.

4961
03:16:34.493 --> 03:16:39.394
MARISHA: Still all creatures coming from the Abyssal Plane.

4962
03:16:39.394 --> 03:16:42.686
Different types of Abyssal creatures,

4963
03:16:42.686 --> 03:16:44.569
so who knows how wide the reach stretches

4964
03:16:44.569 --> 03:16:46.810
on the Abyssal side as well.

4965
03:16:46.810 --> 03:16:48.393
TALIESIN: That's interesting.

4966
03:16:50.905 --> 03:16:54.806
TRAVIS: Seems like a child of the Cobalt Soul.

4967
03:16:54.806 --> 03:16:55.639
MARISHA: I have a feeling

4968
03:16:55.639 --> 03:16:58.618
this is going to get worse, though.

4969
03:16:58.618 --> 03:17:01.430
TALIESIN: Yeah, maybe.

4970
03:17:01.430 --> 03:17:05.013
MARISHA: And, if I wanted to invade another realm,

4971
03:17:06.730 --> 03:17:07.753
when they were at war

4972
03:17:07.753 --> 03:17:11.759
would be the perfect time to do it, to me.

4973
03:17:11.759 --> 03:17:14.748
Everyone's distracted right now.

4974
03:17:14.748 --> 03:17:17.135
Fighting each other.

4975
03:17:17.135 --> 03:17:19.753
LIAM: Do you think it could be your friend?

4976
03:17:19.753 --> 03:17:22.620
MARISHA: No, she's so caught up in the war.

4977
03:17:22.620 --> 03:17:24.429
What would the Cobalt Reserve

4978
03:17:24.429 --> 03:17:27.453
have to break through the rift?

4979
03:17:27.453 --> 03:17:30.923
LIAM: This could just be creating a problem for the Dynasty.

4980
03:17:30.923 --> 03:17:33.814
Keep them distracted, I don't know.

4981
03:17:33.814 --> 03:17:36.937
SAM: No, I think Beau could be on to something.

4982
03:17:36.937 --> 03:17:39.254
I think someone could be stirring up the war

4983
03:17:39.254 --> 03:17:43.847
to create some sort of big diversion for the master plan.

4984
03:17:43.847 --> 03:17:46.653
LIAM: It could be the Empire here,

4985
03:17:46.653 --> 03:17:50.226
trying to divert their attention away from the front line,

4986
03:17:50.226 --> 03:17:52.454
staying focused.

4987
03:17:52.454 --> 03:17:54.409
MARISHA: Could be, or it could just be some sort of

4988
03:17:54.409 --> 03:17:58.019
completely random outside third party source as well.

4989
03:17:58.019 --> 03:18:00.758
LIAM: It could.
LAURA: Yeah.

4990
03:18:00.758 --> 03:18:04.223
TRAVIS: When we took it back to the first time,

4991
03:18:04.223 --> 03:18:08.074
we put it in front of Lythir VaSuun.

4992
03:18:08.074 --> 03:18:11.509
He recognized what it did and why.

4993
03:18:11.509 --> 03:18:13.094
If there's a second one we should see

4994
03:18:13.094 --> 03:18:14.748
what their reaction is,

4995
03:18:14.748 --> 03:18:16.127
if they could shed any more light

4996
03:18:16.127 --> 03:18:18.252
on who would create something like this

4997
03:18:18.252 --> 03:18:20.233
and how it would be done.

4998
03:18:20.233 --> 03:18:21.446
LAURA: Because they're usually,

4999
03:18:21.446 --> 03:18:23.988
they said they were remnants of the old wars right?

5000
03:18:23.988 --> 03:18:26.316
TRAVIS: Right.
LAURA: But this one seems newer.

5001
03:18:26.316 --> 03:18:27.769
It seemed newer.

5002
03:18:27.769 --> 03:18:28.956
MATT: From what you've seen,

5003
03:18:28.956 --> 03:18:31.967
it doesn't appear to have the signs of age

5004
03:18:31.967 --> 03:18:34.153
and it would have to be well over,

5005
03:18:34.153 --> 03:18:36.216
or, sorry almost a thousand years old

5006
03:18:36.216 --> 03:18:41.126
for it to have been at least during or pre-Calamity.

5007
03:18:41.126 --> 03:18:43.884
TRAVIS: But is it just arcane means,

5008
03:18:43.884 --> 03:18:48.559
or is it the use of duny-mancy?

5009
03:18:51.263 --> 03:18:56.263
MARISHA: Does any about this recognize as doodie-mancy?

5010
03:18:56.569 --> 03:18:58.127
MATT: Make an arcana check.

5011
03:18:58.127 --> 03:19:00.180
MARISHA: (groaning)

5012
03:19:00.180 --> 03:19:01.318
SAM: I feel like you're the worst at those.

5013
03:19:01.318 --> 03:19:03.168
TALIESIN: Put a 1000 piece puzzle together

5014
03:19:03.168 --> 03:19:04.576
with only 50 pieces.

5015
03:19:04.576 --> 03:19:06.191
MARISHA: Nine!

5016
03:19:06.191 --> 03:19:08.726
MATT: Nine! You have no idea.

5017
03:19:08.726 --> 03:19:11.564
You've only had a few run ins with any sort of dunamancy,

5018
03:19:11.564 --> 03:19:16.044
and you're not certain if any elements of this are,

5019
03:19:16.044 --> 03:19:20.323
or are not created or

5020
03:19:20.323 --> 03:19:22.582
run by Dunamis.

5021
03:19:22.582 --> 03:19:25.184
LIAM: May I have a look at it?

5022
03:19:25.184 --> 03:19:27.344
I plop it down in the middle of the dome

5023
03:19:27.344 --> 03:19:30.318
and I pull out my book and I spend some time with it

5024
03:19:30.318 --> 03:19:32.156
and I cast Detect Magic,

5025
03:19:32.156 --> 03:19:33.465
I don't know if there's anything left to it,

5026
03:19:33.465 --> 03:19:37.838
but that would tell me the school of magic that it is.

5027
03:19:37.838 --> 03:19:38.671
MATT: Correct.

5028
03:19:38.671 --> 03:19:41.024
There is no more magical essence coming from it.

5029
03:19:41.024 --> 03:19:43.396
MATT: Then I will just try to--

5030
03:19:43.396 --> 03:19:45.580
MATT: You did already learn the--

5031
03:19:45.580 --> 03:19:47.782
LIAM: Conjuration for this, right?

5032
03:19:47.782 --> 03:19:49.448
SAM: Yeah, that's right.
LIAM: Well, I wasn't there.

5033
03:19:49.448 --> 03:19:51.066
MARISHA: Do you still have that vial of

5034
03:19:51.066 --> 03:19:52.720
that stuff that we collected?

5035
03:19:52.720 --> 03:19:53.553
LIAM: I do.

5036
03:19:53.553 --> 03:19:54.954
MARISHA: Because there's black stuff in there.

5037
03:19:54.954 --> 03:19:56.778
Is it the same black stuff in there?

5038
03:19:56.778 --> 03:20:01.120
TALIESIN: I got a vibe off of it when we found it,

5039
03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:04.948
like that magic that just makes things--

5040
03:20:04.948 --> 03:20:07.338
SAM: I can do what Fjord suggested.

5041
03:20:07.338 --> 03:20:10.338
Take the piece of fabric,

5042
03:20:10.338 --> 03:20:13.217
the broken disk, put it on the tripod,

5043
03:20:13.217 --> 03:20:18.217
and pour the juice all over it and see what happens.

5044
03:20:18.350 --> 03:20:20.936
TALIESIN: Let's sleep.

5045
03:20:20.936 --> 03:20:22.221
TRAVIS: Outside of the box.

5046
03:20:22.221 --> 03:20:23.625
LAURA: Should we sleep before we do that?

5047
03:20:23.625 --> 03:20:25.291
SAM: Let's sleep.

5048
03:20:25.291 --> 03:20:26.818
TALIESIN: Let's head back.

5049
03:20:26.818 --> 03:20:28.686
MARISHA: Did we recognize if the dunamancy--

5050
03:20:28.686 --> 03:20:31.690
LAURA: Will you ask the Landspeaker

5051
03:20:31.690 --> 03:20:36.344
which one of these stone beds is the most comfortable?

5052
03:20:36.344 --> 03:20:39.009
TALIESIN: I think you want to sleep in the dome, though.

5053
03:20:39.009 --> 03:20:40.315
LAURA: Okay.

5054
03:20:40.315 --> 03:20:42.394
I just want to lay down somewhere.

5055
03:20:42.394 --> 03:20:44.890
SAM: Let's go to sleep in here, it's nice.

5056
03:20:44.890 --> 03:20:46.723
TALIESIN: Cuddle pile.

5057
03:20:48.009 --> 03:20:49.566
SAM: We'll rest for the night.

5058
03:20:49.566 --> 03:20:51.140
MATT: Okay, what are you guys doing?

5059
03:20:51.140 --> 03:20:52.761
SAM: What are you trying to find out?

5060
03:20:52.761 --> 03:20:53.852
MARISHA: There was a black,

5061
03:20:53.852 --> 03:20:56.314
mercurial liquid inside the disk, right?

5062
03:20:56.314 --> 03:20:57.933
MATT: Inside of the orb, yeah.

5063
03:20:57.933 --> 03:21:00.922
TRAVIS: It shattered when he shot through it.

5064
03:21:00.922 --> 03:21:02.996
MARISHA: Is there still a little bit of that in there?

5065
03:21:02.996 --> 03:21:05.908
MATT: No, there's nothing in the device,

5066
03:21:05.908 --> 03:21:10.054
it was shattered outward from the pistol blast.

5067
03:21:10.054 --> 03:21:13.117
LIAM: How about you and I take the, stay up?

5068
03:21:13.117 --> 03:21:14.908
MARISHA: All right.

5069
03:21:15.815 --> 03:21:17.015
TRAVIS: All right, go to sleep.

5070
03:21:17.015 --> 03:21:18.609
MARISHA: Can we take the first watch?

5071
03:21:18.609 --> 03:21:19.619
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

5072
03:21:19.619 --> 03:21:22.487
I set the vial down, I've been putting this off.

5073
03:21:22.487 --> 03:21:24.668
MATT: Okay. The rest of you guys rest.

5074
03:21:24.668 --> 03:21:27.803
Soorna's going to head up into the seeing chamber

5075
03:21:27.803 --> 03:21:29.880
and meditate.

5076
03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:33.467
LIAM: Every time I mean to spend some time with this,

5077
03:21:33.467 --> 03:21:36.501
we get distracted by other things.

5078
03:21:36.501 --> 03:21:40.141
I will use my spell book to cast Identify, finally,

5079
03:21:40.141 --> 03:21:41.267
on this vial.

5080
03:21:41.267 --> 03:21:42.972
MATT: On the vial?
LIAM: Yeah.

5081
03:21:42.972 --> 03:21:44.038
MATT: Okay.

5082
03:21:44.038 --> 03:21:45.684
(paper peeling)

5083
03:21:45.684 --> 03:21:46.517
SAM: Oh!

5084
03:21:48.913 --> 03:21:50.830
We've had this forever!

5085
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:55.897
TRAVIS: Identify.

5086
03:21:57.396 --> 03:22:00.097
LIAM: I'm just reading, everybody, I'm just reading.

5087
03:22:00.097 --> 03:22:01.072
LAURA: Hey, I'm sleeping.

5088
03:22:01.072 --> 03:22:04.913
I can't bug you about it right now.

5089
03:22:06.016 --> 03:22:08.599
SAM: I'll cuddle up with Yasha.

5090
03:22:10.141 --> 03:22:12.133
ASHLEY: I'm uncomfortable right now.

5091
03:22:12.133 --> 03:22:14.408
I slide my cloak over her.

5092
03:22:16.129 --> 03:22:19.004
LIAM: This is very much like...

5093
03:22:21.546 --> 03:22:24.068
They somehow did it,

5094
03:22:24.068 --> 03:22:27.598
they somehow pulled the possibility

5095
03:22:27.598 --> 03:22:32.598
out of the dodecahedron and it is in here.

5096
03:22:32.899 --> 03:22:33.956
MARISHA: That sounds what--

5097
03:22:33.956 --> 03:22:35.646
LIAM: Slightly more potent.

5098
03:22:35.646 --> 03:22:37.303
MARISHA: That's what Yeza was saying, yeah.

5099
03:22:37.303 --> 03:22:39.136
LIAM: More potent, though.

5100
03:22:40.468 --> 03:22:42.218
LAURA: It's a luck potion.

5101
03:22:46.590 --> 03:22:48.499
LAURA: I wonder if we have robbed them of the ability

5102
03:22:48.499 --> 03:22:51.991
to do this anymore, or if they have the others

5103
03:22:51.991 --> 03:22:53.492
that are missing.

5104
03:22:53.492 --> 03:22:55.133
Probably.

5105
03:22:56.190 --> 03:23:00.706
MARISHA: Why break it down to a

5106
03:23:00.706 --> 03:23:04.075
singular potion and not leave it in its form?

5107
03:23:04.075 --> 03:23:06.220
LIAM: Well, I don't think it was meant to be singular,

5108
03:23:06.220 --> 03:23:08.491
I think they are trying to--

5109
03:23:08.491 --> 03:23:09.595
MARISHA: Farm it.

5110
03:23:09.595 --> 03:23:13.977
LIAM: Yeah, take golden eggs from the goose, you know.

5111
03:23:13.977 --> 03:23:15.318
MARISHA: So...

5112
03:23:16.621 --> 03:23:17.534
do you want to take a walk,

5113
03:23:17.534 --> 03:23:19.572
see if we can find any more of this black liquid,

5114
03:23:19.572 --> 03:23:21.335
and see if it's the same shit?

5115
03:23:21.335 --> 03:23:23.075
LIAM: Take a walk in this building?

5116
03:23:23.075 --> 03:23:24.636
MARISHA: Yeah, see if any of this black liquid

5117
03:23:24.636 --> 03:23:26.750
that was in this thing shattered and hit the ground.

5118
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:27.863
LIAM: I...

5119
03:23:27.863 --> 03:23:29.713
If I do that, the dome will fall.

5120
03:23:29.713 --> 03:23:31.380
MARISHA: Oh. You want me to go--

5121
03:23:31.380 --> 03:23:32.382
LIAM: Do you want to go with my cat?

5122
03:23:32.382 --> 03:23:33.667
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5123
03:23:33.667 --> 03:23:36.478
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check for me.

5124
03:23:36.478 --> 03:23:37.967
This is going to be a really high DC.

5125
03:23:37.967 --> 03:23:40.738
MARISHA: I know, I know it is.

5126
03:23:40.738 --> 03:23:42.755
MATT: This is some forensic shit right here.

5127
03:23:42.755 --> 03:23:44.310
MARISHA: Looking for blood splatters.

5128
03:23:44.310 --> 03:23:47.485
LIAM: I assist with Frumpkin looking.

5129
03:23:47.485 --> 03:23:49.751
MATT: This is an investigation check, Frumpkin--

5130
03:23:49.751 --> 03:23:51.431
LIAM: I have a very high investigation.

5131
03:23:51.431 --> 03:23:53.892
MATT: No, Frumpkin.

5132
03:23:53.892 --> 03:23:56.327
LIAM: But it's my brain looking through--

5133
03:23:56.327 --> 03:23:57.383
MATT: I'll--

5134
03:23:57.383 --> 03:23:59.735
LIAM: No, don't worry about it, leave it.

5135
03:23:59.735 --> 03:24:01.067
MATT: There are limitations to your familiar.

5136
03:24:01.067 --> 03:24:02.400
LIAM: Straight roll.

5137
03:24:04.686 --> 03:24:07.492
MARISHA: (sighing) Fuck.

5138
03:24:07.492 --> 03:24:08.325
Ten.

5139
03:24:08.325 --> 03:24:09.351
MATT: Ten.

5140
03:24:09.351 --> 03:24:12.684
You spend a good hour trying to search--

5141
03:24:13.827 --> 03:24:15.374
MARISHA: There's too much blood and gore.

5142
03:24:15.374 --> 03:24:17.249
MATT: Yep. There's a lot of materials around here

5143
03:24:17.249 --> 03:24:21.844
and there's no way of knowing what is what.

5144
03:24:21.844 --> 03:24:24.039
LIAM: Frumpkin meows.

5145
03:24:24.039 --> 03:24:26.206
MATT: (meowing)

5146
03:24:29.945 --> 03:24:32.043
But you do hear a rumble.

5147
03:24:32.043 --> 03:24:34.452
(rumbling)

5148
03:24:34.452 --> 03:24:39.452
Some of you come out of your sleep for a moment.

5149
03:24:39.841 --> 03:24:42.174
(whooshing)

5150
03:24:44.552 --> 03:24:46.773
Rain.

5151
03:24:49.950 --> 03:24:51.112
Thunder in the distance,

5152
03:24:51.112 --> 03:24:53.431
rolling through the valley nearby.

5153
03:24:53.431 --> 03:24:54.727
A thunder storm has arrived.

5154
03:24:54.727 --> 03:24:57.469
You've seen the clouds slowly gathering

5155
03:24:57.469 --> 03:25:00.465
and now the storm is here.

5156
03:25:00.465 --> 03:25:02.381
MARISHA: I turn over, look over at

5157
03:25:02.381 --> 03:25:04.043
a sleeping Yasha in the dome.

5158
03:25:04.043 --> 03:25:06.379
Anything?

5159
03:25:06.379 --> 03:25:08.267
MATT: Nott is cuddled up

5160
03:25:08.267 --> 03:25:12.827
and folded into Yasha's brawny arms, she's asleep.

5161
03:25:12.827 --> 03:25:14.994
SAM: (purring)

5162
03:25:17.745 --> 03:25:20.053
MARISHA: Well, I guess we should

5163
03:25:20.053 --> 03:25:23.195
eventually get some rest as well.

5164
03:25:23.195 --> 03:25:24.703
LIAM: We're fine 'till morning.

5165
03:25:24.703 --> 03:25:29.144
Frumpkin, you stay up, okay?

5166
03:25:29.144 --> 03:25:32.171
You wake me up if anything goes wrong.

5167
03:25:32.171 --> 03:25:34.338
MATT: (purring)

5168
03:25:36.251 --> 03:25:37.886
LIAM: Good night, Beauregard.

5169
03:25:37.886 --> 03:25:41.703
MARISHA: I'm going to just read a little bit more.

5170
03:25:41.703 --> 03:25:45.953
LIAM: Caleb places his head into the crook of Nott's...

5171
03:25:47.287 --> 03:25:49.287
knee, and goes to sleep.

5172
03:25:50.212 --> 03:25:54.868
MARISHA: I stay up for another one, two, three,

5173
03:25:54.868 --> 03:25:57.543
starts to bleed, hours.
LIAM: Exhaustion.

5174
03:25:57.543 --> 03:25:59.764
MARISHA: I just, scribbling notes,

5175
03:25:59.764 --> 03:26:03.364
going through everything that I had written, thinking,

5176
03:26:03.364 --> 03:26:04.599
looking at the swatch,

5177
03:26:04.599 --> 03:26:07.937
comparing the swatch to other parts of my uniform,

5178
03:26:07.937 --> 03:26:12.137
putting it away, no one sees this.

5179
03:26:13.467 --> 03:26:14.867
LIAM: Frumpkin sees it, but.

5180
03:26:14.867 --> 03:26:16.633
LAURA: Beau.

5181
03:26:16.633 --> 03:26:18.372
MARISHA: What, what?

5182
03:26:18.372 --> 03:26:19.759
What, hey?

5183
03:26:19.759 --> 03:26:21.515
LAURA: You need to sleep.

5184
03:26:21.515 --> 03:26:23.364
MARISHA: Yeah.

5185
03:26:23.364 --> 03:26:24.971
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5186
03:26:24.971 --> 03:26:26.699
Racing mind, you know.

5187
03:26:26.699 --> 03:26:29.015
LAURA: Yeah.

5188
03:26:29.015 --> 03:26:32.699
Here, come over here, I'll give you a massage.

5189
03:26:32.699 --> 03:26:34.907
Calm down, go to sleep.

5190
03:26:34.907 --> 03:26:35.975
MARISHA: You rub my back a little?

5191
03:26:35.975 --> 03:26:38.327
LAURA: I rub her back a little so it helps her fall asleep.

5192
03:26:38.327 --> 03:26:39.160
MATT: Okay.

5193
03:26:39.160 --> 03:26:42.820
MARISHA: I put away everything, hide everything.

5194
03:26:42.820 --> 03:26:43.920
TRAVIS: Jester gives one of those massages

5195
03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:46.290
that fucking hurts!

5196
03:26:46.290 --> 03:26:47.713
LAURA: No, I'm being very calm about it.

5197
03:26:47.713 --> 03:26:49.751
MARISHA: Those are muscles hurting--

5198
03:26:49.751 --> 03:26:51.911
LIAM: (powerful exhales)

5199
03:26:51.911 --> 03:26:55.489
LAURA: Everyone says I give really good massages.

5200
03:26:55.489 --> 03:26:57.739
(laughter)

5201
03:26:58.711 --> 03:27:00.319
MARISHA: Feels good!

5202
03:27:00.319 --> 03:27:01.479
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

5203
03:27:01.479 --> 03:27:03.041
LIAM: Only four bludgeoning damage.

5204
03:27:03.041 --> 03:27:04.289
MATT: Yasha.

5205
03:27:04.289 --> 03:27:06.456
(gasping)

5206
03:27:07.487 --> 03:27:08.729
ASHLEY: I'm immediately red.

5207
03:27:08.729 --> 03:27:10.979
(laughter)

5208
03:27:12.271 --> 03:27:16.688
MATT: In your exhaustion, the darkness comes comfortably.

5209
03:27:17.551 --> 03:27:22.301
As the night's rest, and an evening's respite.

5210
03:27:24.042 --> 03:27:28.783
And though you don't awaken, you can feel the thunder,

5211
03:27:28.783 --> 03:27:33.033
you can feel it roll and vibrate through your body.

5212
03:27:34.137 --> 03:27:37.311
With each impact,

5213
03:27:37.311 --> 03:27:41.321
there's a flash of light behind your eyes,

5214
03:27:41.321 --> 03:27:44.488
like a heart beat of a dull blue glow.

5215
03:27:46.088 --> 03:27:48.338
(rumbling)

5216
03:27:52.506 --> 03:27:54.756
(crashing)

5217
03:27:56.297 --> 03:28:00.630
A deafening blast of thunder shakes your eyes awake,

5218
03:28:01.933 --> 03:28:04.041
and you are soaked,

5219
03:28:04.041 --> 03:28:08.937
standing on the precipice of a mountain.

5220
03:28:08.937 --> 03:28:12.139
You can see the heavy clouds before you,

5221
03:28:12.139 --> 03:28:14.815
with slight little breaches between

5222
03:28:14.815 --> 03:28:17.673
where moonlight and stars are briefly visible

5223
03:28:17.673 --> 03:28:19.999
before they are consumed once more by the storm.

5224
03:28:19.999 --> 03:28:22.249
(crashing)

5225
03:28:23.337 --> 03:28:27.478
Arcs of lightning shoot across the Xhorhas sky.

5226
03:28:27.478 --> 03:28:30.969
You're cold, shivering, your hair matted over your face,

5227
03:28:30.969 --> 03:28:33.719
your eyes barely peeking through.

5228
03:28:34.666 --> 03:28:36.694
(crashing)

5229
03:28:36.694 --> 03:28:41.544
Through another arc, you think you see an arm.

5230
03:28:41.544 --> 03:28:43.004
(thudding)

5231
03:28:43.004 --> 03:28:45.273
Through the clouds.

5232
03:28:45.273 --> 03:28:47.282
And it's gone.

5233
03:28:48.367 --> 03:28:49.532
(crashing)

5234
03:28:49.532 --> 03:28:52.707
Another flash of light and you see

5235
03:28:52.707 --> 03:28:56.470
a humanoid form

5236
03:28:56.470 --> 03:29:00.684
reaching from the storm

5237
03:29:00.684 --> 03:29:03.367
towards you.

5238
03:29:04.646 --> 03:29:07.993
Your instinct is to turn and run,

5239
03:29:07.993 --> 03:29:11.326
but you watch as the head turns...

5240
03:29:12.601 --> 03:29:13.434
(crashing)

5241
03:29:13.434 --> 03:29:16.517
Another flash of light and it's gone.

5242
03:29:19.526 --> 03:29:23.043
You sense a presence behind you.

5243
03:29:24.671 --> 03:29:26.213
What do you do?

5244
03:29:27.503 --> 03:29:28.836
ASHLEY: I turn around

5245
03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:32.137
and walk towards it.

5246
03:29:32.137 --> 03:29:35.366
MATT: You turn around from the space where you were standing

5247
03:29:35.366 --> 03:29:38.865
and the opposite side of this mountain range

5248
03:29:38.865 --> 03:29:41.724
is just bodies,

5249
03:29:41.724 --> 03:29:44.953
corpses, littered and stretched out before you.

5250
03:29:44.953 --> 03:29:47.878
Dozens and dozens of them.

5251
03:29:47.878 --> 03:29:49.273
You can't see their faces,

5252
03:29:49.273 --> 03:29:54.273
you just see folded arms and legs, wounds,

5253
03:29:54.598 --> 03:29:58.598
and there standing behind you was a shaded figure.

5254
03:29:58.598 --> 03:30:00.470
(crashing)

5255
03:30:00.470 --> 03:30:02.639
Another flash of light behind you emanates

5256
03:30:02.639 --> 03:30:05.639
and briefly frames the face you see.

5257
03:30:07.689 --> 03:30:10.803
A familiar male figure.

5258
03:30:10.803 --> 03:30:13.886
His curved horns back from the front,

5259
03:30:13.886 --> 03:30:16.754
his wings folded over his shoulders.

5260
03:30:16.754 --> 03:30:20.421
His sly grin and yellow eyes peering at you.

5261
03:30:23.473 --> 03:30:26.092
He just looks,

5262
03:30:26.092 --> 03:30:28.675
shakes his head and walks away.

5263
03:30:31.599 --> 03:30:36.599
ASHLEY: Do I recognize any of the bodies?

5264
03:30:36.809 --> 03:30:37.791
Anything on the bodies?

5265
03:30:37.791 --> 03:30:41.858
Is anything about it familiar to me?

5266
03:30:43.325 --> 03:30:44.601
MATT: You go towards the bodies?

5267
03:30:44.601 --> 03:30:46.292
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5268
03:30:46.292 --> 03:30:49.675
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

5269
03:30:49.675 --> 03:30:50.917
SAM: Saving throw?

5270
03:30:57.094 --> 03:30:58.643
ASHLEY: Oh that's cocked.

5271
03:30:58.643 --> 03:31:00.560
Ah, come on.

5272
03:31:02.009 --> 03:31:02.842
What?

5273
03:31:02.842 --> 03:31:04.523
Do you see what's happening, it's a little?

5274
03:31:04.523 --> 03:31:06.348
LAURA: It's landing on the corner.

5275
03:31:06.348 --> 03:31:08.150
SAM: That is the weirdest dice.

5276
03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:09.138
LAURA: Yeah, it's a crazy little die.

5277
03:31:09.138 --> 03:31:10.138
TALIESIN: Crazy die.

5278
03:31:11.490 --> 03:31:12.847
ASHLEY: 15.

5279
03:31:12.847 --> 03:31:13.680
MATT: 15.

5280
03:31:14.823 --> 03:31:18.543
This figure that is familiar to you,

5281
03:31:18.543 --> 03:31:22.168
but you don't know why or where,

5282
03:31:22.168 --> 03:31:24.748
causes something in your heart to freeze

5283
03:31:24.748 --> 03:31:28.950
and you feel the fear welling up in your throat.

5284
03:31:28.950 --> 03:31:32.331
This heavy lump that's making it hard to swallow,

5285
03:31:32.331 --> 03:31:36.214
and you try and take a step and...

5286
03:31:37.494 --> 03:31:40.671
you have to force yourself to move.

5287
03:31:40.671 --> 03:31:41.836
You take another step,

5288
03:31:41.836 --> 03:31:46.793
and you go towards one of the bodies and turn it over.

5289
03:31:46.793 --> 03:31:48.190
And it's Mollymauk.

5290
03:31:48.190 --> 03:31:49.890
(gasping)

5291
03:31:52.217 --> 03:31:53.250
You go look to the left

5292
03:31:53.250 --> 03:31:55.950
and you look and there's Jester.

5293
03:31:59.220 --> 03:32:02.637
You look past that and you see Caleb.

5294
03:32:05.103 --> 03:32:08.774
You start to look around and every body

5295
03:32:08.774 --> 03:32:12.124
is somebody who's crossed your path.

5296
03:32:12.124 --> 03:32:14.041
Somebody you've let in.

5297
03:32:15.484 --> 03:32:17.644
You glance up and that figure just keeps walking away,

5298
03:32:17.644 --> 03:32:18.755
shaking his head.

5299
03:32:18.755 --> 03:32:20.860
(tongue clicking)

5300
03:32:20.860 --> 03:32:22.610
(crashing)

5301
03:32:22.610 --> 03:32:27.603
You wake up as the heavy thunder rolls through the hall.

5302
03:32:27.603 --> 03:32:29.517
Nott, you shake awake a little bit.

5303
03:32:29.517 --> 03:32:31.517
SAM: What are you doing?

5304
03:32:34.911 --> 03:32:35.744
You okay?

5305
03:32:35.744 --> 03:32:37.410
ASHLEY: Is anyone else awake?

5306
03:32:37.410 --> 03:32:39.386
TALIESIN: I'm quietly awake.

5307
03:32:39.386 --> 03:32:41.295
MATT: Jester's awake, too.

5308
03:32:41.295 --> 03:32:42.435
SAM: What happened? Where are you?

5309
03:32:42.435 --> 03:32:45.185
What's going on? What did you do?

5310
03:32:47.162 --> 03:32:49.779
ASHLEY: I had a...

5311
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:53.007
I had a very bad dream.

5312
03:32:53.007 --> 03:32:54.927
SAM: Do you want some liquor?

5313
03:32:54.927 --> 03:32:57.510
LAURA: Do you want to talk about it?

5314
03:33:01.146 --> 03:33:02.380
ASHLEY: No.

5315
03:33:02.380 --> 03:33:05.212
LAURA: Do you want a massage?

5316
03:33:05.212 --> 03:33:06.879
SAM: They're very hard.

5317
03:33:08.575 --> 03:33:10.323
ASHLEY: I think I'm okay.

5318
03:33:10.323 --> 03:33:11.583
SAM: Is it a dream you've had before,

5319
03:33:11.583 --> 03:33:15.750
is it like one of Fjord's dreams that keep coming?

5320
03:33:17.318 --> 03:33:20.257
ASHLEY: I do keep having dreams,

5321
03:33:20.257 --> 03:33:25.216
but sometimes they feel like they're very real or familiar.

5322
03:33:29.532 --> 03:33:32.440
I don't know if...

5323
03:33:36.985 --> 03:33:40.105
They make me very scared.

5324
03:33:40.105 --> 03:33:42.855
LAURA: Was it about somebody you knew?

5325
03:33:47.667 --> 03:33:49.742
ASHLEY: Yes.

5326
03:33:50.595 --> 03:33:52.332
Yes.

5327
03:33:52.332 --> 03:33:53.641
SAM: Well, do you think it's something,

5328
03:33:53.641 --> 03:33:56.582
sometimes dreams can be like a premonition,

5329
03:33:56.582 --> 03:33:57.830
something in your future,

5330
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:59.280
or it could be something in your past,

5331
03:33:59.280 --> 03:34:01.910
did it feel like a past or a future?

5332
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:04.284
ASHLEY: Sometimes, they're both,

5333
03:34:04.284 --> 03:34:09.117
but this one felt like this was definitely not in the past

5334
03:34:10.188 --> 03:34:14.451
and I'm hoping that it's not in the future.

5335
03:34:14.451 --> 03:34:18.012
LAURA: Tell us about it, what happened?

5336
03:34:18.012 --> 03:34:20.316
SAM: We're good listeners.

5337
03:34:20.316 --> 03:34:22.332
Also, you've woken us up.

5338
03:34:22.332 --> 03:34:24.483
LAURA: (giggling) I was already awake.

5339
03:34:24.483 --> 03:34:25.740
Don't worry about it.

5340
03:34:25.740 --> 03:34:27.907
ASHLEY: (sighing)

5341
03:34:30.791 --> 03:34:34.044
I think I've done something very bad.

5342
03:34:34.044 --> 03:34:35.627
LAURA: What do you mean?

5343
03:34:36.985 --> 03:34:38.585
ASHLEY: I think I've done something very bad

5344
03:34:38.585 --> 03:34:40.718
and I don't remember.

5345
03:34:40.718 --> 03:34:42.457
SAM: You don't remember?

5346
03:34:43.883 --> 03:34:45.591
ASHLEY: Well.

5347
03:34:47.654 --> 03:34:51.654
LAURA: Is this about when you left your village?

5348
03:34:54.060 --> 03:34:58.051
ASHLEY: I don't know. I'm very confused.

5349
03:34:59.002 --> 03:35:02.085
TALIESIN: What does the Lord require of thee?

5350
03:35:06.219 --> 03:35:07.385
LAURA: Are you asleep?

5351
03:35:07.385 --> 03:35:09.265
TALIESIN: No.
LAURA: Oh.

5352
03:35:09.265 --> 03:35:12.866
TALIESIN: It's raining, there's lightning and thunder.

5353
03:35:12.866 --> 03:35:16.457
Someone's trying to send you a message.

5354
03:35:16.457 --> 03:35:19.395
ASHLEY: But it's not a very positive message.

5355
03:35:19.395 --> 03:35:22.478
TALIESIN: That all depends on interpretation.

5356
03:35:24.159 --> 03:35:27.627
What does the Lord require thee?

5357
03:35:27.627 --> 03:35:30.003
Thunder and lightning.

5358
03:35:30.003 --> 03:35:34.086
That's how I'd talk to you if I were a Stormlord.

5359
03:35:35.763 --> 03:35:38.559
LAURA: Is this storm just for you, Yasha?

5360
03:35:38.559 --> 03:35:40.732
ASHLEY: I don't think so.

5361
03:35:40.732 --> 03:35:41.565
But...

5362
03:35:43.007 --> 03:35:47.990
If it is, I saw a...

5363
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:49.932
(sighing)

5364
03:35:49.932 --> 03:35:52.345
LAURA: Just say it, what was it?

5365
03:35:52.345 --> 03:35:54.132
SAM: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's fine.

5366
03:35:54.132 --> 03:35:55.715
LAURA: We can handle it.

5367
03:35:58.428 --> 03:36:00.711
ASHLEY: I saw a lot of...

5368
03:36:02.713 --> 03:36:05.038
Dead bodies and...

5369
03:36:06.028 --> 03:36:07.711
I saw...

5370
03:36:08.716 --> 03:36:10.277
Mollymauk.

5371
03:36:10.277 --> 03:36:12.143
LAURA: Hmm.

5372
03:36:13.385 --> 03:36:15.610
ASHLEY: And a lot of...

5373
03:36:17.212 --> 03:36:20.171
Other people that I've known.

5374
03:36:21.303 --> 03:36:22.935
LAURA: That's very sad, Yasha.

5375
03:36:22.935 --> 03:36:25.493
SAM: That's super fucked up.

5376
03:36:25.493 --> 03:36:26.790
LAURA: Maybe it's because we just fought

5377
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:28.025
a bunch of undead things.

5378
03:36:28.025 --> 03:36:30.246
Maybe you were just trying to process it.

5379
03:36:30.246 --> 03:36:32.413
ASHLEY: It could be, it might be something and it's just--

5380
03:36:32.413 --> 03:36:34.396
SAM: Do you think that maybe you're doing

5381
03:36:34.396 --> 03:36:36.863
something right or wrong, or--

5382
03:36:36.863 --> 03:36:39.580
ASHLEY: I don't know, I think that's, I...

5383
03:36:40.444 --> 03:36:43.684
SAM: Was it a warning, was it a punishment?

5384
03:36:43.684 --> 03:36:45.683
ASHLEY: I feel like every time I have it,

5385
03:36:45.683 --> 03:36:48.374
it's very scary and I...

5386
03:36:50.873 --> 03:36:53.559
It feels like I've caused something.

5387
03:36:53.559 --> 03:36:57.389
ASHLEY: Do you ever talk to the Stormlord and say like,

5388
03:36:57.389 --> 03:36:59.582
"Hey what are you trying to tell me?"

5389
03:36:59.582 --> 03:37:01.084
SAM: Jester talks to her god all the time.

5390
03:37:01.084 --> 03:37:01.917
LAURA: Yeah!

5391
03:37:01.917 --> 03:37:03.078
ASHLEY: I could try--

5392
03:37:03.078 --> 03:37:04.828
LAURA: Yeah, give it a go.

5393
03:37:06.315 --> 03:37:07.648
ASHLEY: But I think...

5394
03:37:10.329 --> 03:37:12.451
You both have a very different relationships

5395
03:37:12.451 --> 03:37:17.362
with your gods and it feels

5396
03:37:17.362 --> 03:37:20.365
much more personal

5397
03:37:20.365 --> 03:37:22.948
and I feel like with me, it's...

5398
03:37:24.519 --> 03:37:25.741
I'm not scared of a lot of things

5399
03:37:25.741 --> 03:37:28.647
but I'm a little bit scared of him.

5400
03:37:28.647 --> 03:37:29.581
LAURA: Really?

5401
03:37:29.581 --> 03:37:30.815
ASHLEY: But, maybe--

5402
03:37:30.815 --> 03:37:32.815
LAURA: Don't you worship him?

5403
03:37:33.831 --> 03:37:38.656
ASHLEY: Well, I think he just,

5404
03:37:38.656 --> 03:37:40.247
he pulled me out of something

5405
03:37:40.247 --> 03:37:44.247
and saved my life, so I feel like I owe him that.

5406
03:37:46.064 --> 03:37:47.380
LAURA: Well, he seems to be paying

5407
03:37:47.380 --> 03:37:50.055
a lot of attention to you.

5408
03:37:50.993 --> 03:37:52.676
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5409
03:37:52.676 --> 03:37:56.525
I think I should maybe try to have some conversations.

5410
03:37:56.525 --> 03:37:58.624
SAM: Next time you have a dream, maybe you should,

5411
03:37:58.624 --> 03:38:00.989
like, plan what you're going to say now.

5412
03:38:00.989 --> 03:38:02.705
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: So you know.

5413
03:38:02.705 --> 03:38:04.410
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Like, what's your opener?

5414
03:38:04.410 --> 03:38:05.966
You've got to have a strong opener.

5415
03:38:05.966 --> 03:38:06.799
ASHLEY: Uh.

5416
03:38:08.887 --> 03:38:11.316
SAM: What do you want with me?!

5417
03:38:11.316 --> 03:38:15.761
LAURA: Why are you being so creepy? Just be nice, okay?!

5418
03:38:15.761 --> 03:38:18.401
TALIESIN: Too loud, too loud, too loud.

5419
03:38:18.401 --> 03:38:21.463
LAURA: What if, Yasha, what if we, it's raining right now,

5420
03:38:21.463 --> 03:38:24.874
it's stormy, what if we go outside

5421
03:38:24.874 --> 03:38:27.713
and we like yell up at the sky right now

5422
03:38:27.713 --> 03:38:31.409
and you know you can just let it out.

5423
03:38:31.409 --> 03:38:32.917
SAM: He might hear you

5424
03:38:32.917 --> 03:38:34.986
if he's part of the storm or something.

5425
03:38:34.986 --> 03:38:35.819
ASHLEY: Yeah?

5426
03:38:35.819 --> 03:38:36.737
LAURA: Say, "Just be nice to me!

5427
03:38:36.737 --> 03:38:39.053
"I just want to, you know."

5428
03:38:39.053 --> 03:38:39.886
SAM: Respect me!

5429
03:38:39.886 --> 03:38:43.295
LAURA: Yeah. I'm here for you!
ASHLEY: Respect me!

5430
03:38:43.295 --> 03:38:44.621
Witness me!

5431
03:38:44.621 --> 03:38:45.454
SAM: Yeah!

5432
03:38:45.454 --> 03:38:48.186
ASHLEY: Why are you doing this to me?

5433
03:38:48.186 --> 03:38:50.511
SAM and LAURA: Yeah.

5434
03:38:52.567 --> 03:38:55.108
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, well, I'll think about it.

5435
03:38:55.108 --> 03:38:59.623
If you guys want to sleep, I can take a watch, or you know--

5436
03:38:59.623 --> 03:39:02.573
SAM: Are you going to go out and scream at the sky?

5437
03:39:02.573 --> 03:39:04.570
LAURA: If you do it, we'll go with you, just to be safe.

5438
03:39:04.570 --> 03:39:06.394
SAM: Just to watch.
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

5439
03:39:06.394 --> 03:39:07.271
Yeah, should we go?

5440
03:39:07.271 --> 03:39:09.514
LAURA: Okay, yeah.
SAM: Sure.

5441
03:39:09.514 --> 03:39:13.053
I think we just told her to go scream at the sky.

5442
03:39:13.053 --> 03:39:14.746
LAURA: It's going to be really cool.

5443
03:39:14.746 --> 03:39:16.727
TALIESIN: I'll say, actually, it's a pretty good idea,

5444
03:39:16.727 --> 03:39:20.541
although I will say that I tend to have better luck

5445
03:39:20.541 --> 03:39:22.269
finding what I need to know

5446
03:39:22.269 --> 03:39:26.292
if I'm somewhere quiet and alone.

5447
03:39:26.292 --> 03:39:27.946
As much as I appreciate company.

5448
03:39:27.946 --> 03:39:29.050
LAURA: Aw.

5449
03:39:29.050 --> 03:39:31.332
SAM: Yeah, but you're like the garden god.

5450
03:39:31.332 --> 03:39:33.213
She's the storm god, right?

5451
03:39:33.213 --> 03:39:36.837
LAURA: What if what she needs is more people screaming.

5452
03:39:36.837 --> 03:39:37.956
ASHLEY: Like if we all start--

5453
03:39:37.956 --> 03:39:39.556
LAURA: Screaming at thunder!

5454
03:39:39.556 --> 03:39:41.787
SAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Ah.

5455
03:39:41.787 --> 03:39:42.881
We could try it.

5456
03:39:42.881 --> 03:39:44.380
LAURA: Yeah, and then we'll run back inside really fast,

5457
03:39:44.380 --> 03:39:46.359
because there could be things around that could attack us.

5458
03:39:46.359 --> 03:39:47.192
ASHLEY: Oh, sure.

5459
03:39:47.192 --> 03:39:49.519
I don't know how this works, I am learning.

5460
03:39:49.519 --> 03:39:51.185
I'm definitely learning.

5461
03:39:51.185 --> 03:39:53.021
LAURA: We'll step right outside the door down here.

5462
03:39:53.021 --> 03:39:53.854
MATT: Okay.

5463
03:39:53.854 --> 03:39:56.932
LIAM: Caleb's cat creepily watches them leave.

5464
03:39:56.932 --> 03:39:58.887
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

5465
03:39:58.887 --> 03:40:00.434
MATT: So you--?

5466
03:40:00.434 --> 03:40:01.709
ASHLEY: Is it still storming outside?

5467
03:40:01.709 --> 03:40:03.342
MATT: Oh yeah. Very much so.

5468
03:40:03.342 --> 03:40:04.175
LAURA: Oh!

5469
03:40:04.175 --> 03:40:06.408
SAM: There are storm sound effects happening!

5470
03:40:06.408 --> 03:40:10.708
LAURA: Oh, Yasha, it's really stormy!

5471
03:40:10.708 --> 03:40:13.060
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to step forward a little bit.

5472
03:40:13.060 --> 03:40:17.676
You know, just so it doesn't scare him off

5473
03:40:17.676 --> 03:40:18.759
if you're all here.

5474
03:40:18.759 --> 03:40:21.288
SAM: Can you do something to like help her?

5475
03:40:21.288 --> 03:40:23.415
Give her bravery or something, can't you do--

5476
03:40:23.415 --> 03:40:24.913
you're out of spells aren't you?

5477
03:40:24.913 --> 03:40:28.722
LAURA: I've got a 1st-level left. I'm going to Bless you.

5478
03:40:28.722 --> 03:40:29.582
I'm going to cast Bless on you.

5479
03:40:29.582 --> 03:40:32.737
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Just go, it could be useful.

5480
03:40:32.737 --> 03:40:33.819
ASHLEY: Okay.

5481
03:40:33.819 --> 03:40:37.227
LIAM: Just a happy little bless.

5482
03:40:38.271 --> 03:40:43.271
ASHLEY: I will step out so I still see them,

5483
03:40:43.761 --> 03:40:46.977
but far enough away where I feel like I have some privacy.

5484
03:40:46.977 --> 03:40:49.736
MATT: You step beyond the exterior of the fortress.

5485
03:40:49.736 --> 03:40:51.451
There's the courtyard in this little niche

5486
03:40:51.451 --> 03:40:54.152
in the mountain range,

5487
03:40:54.152 --> 03:40:57.133
the sides of the mountain,

5488
03:40:57.133 --> 03:40:59.709
descending V before you actually head out

5489
03:40:59.709 --> 03:41:03.146
into the mountain pass looking out over all of Xhorhas.

5490
03:41:03.146 --> 03:41:05.075
You'd have to walk quite a few hundred feet,

5491
03:41:05.075 --> 03:41:08.448
to get out even into the mountain pass. Do you go that way?

5492
03:41:08.448 --> 03:41:10.765
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

5493
03:41:12.314 --> 03:41:15.981
You walk out there, cold rain drenching you,

5494
03:41:17.074 --> 03:41:19.157
in an eerily familiar way.

5495
03:41:20.291 --> 03:41:23.615
Causes you to feel a little bit

5496
03:41:23.615 --> 03:41:28.615
of a crawling nervousness in your belly,

5497
03:41:28.692 --> 03:41:30.288
as you now begin to sensory--

5498
03:41:30.288 --> 03:41:32.723
ASHLEY: Like I am now?

5499
03:41:32.723 --> 03:41:34.148
MATT: Sensory recall

5500
03:41:34.148 --> 03:41:37.475
the dream that you have just woken up from.

5501
03:41:37.475 --> 03:41:39.576
You feel the cold rain water

5502
03:41:39.576 --> 03:41:44.384
soaking into all of your outfit and the back.

5503
03:41:46.048 --> 03:41:48.456
You step out on the mountain pass,

5504
03:41:48.456 --> 03:41:49.523
you glance over your shoulder,

5505
03:41:49.523 --> 03:41:51.290
and you can barely see the silhouettes

5506
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:54.515
of Jester and Nott in the doorway.

5507
03:41:54.515 --> 03:41:56.315
LAURA: You see our--

5508
03:42:01.261 --> 03:42:05.624
MATT: You look, turn around, you can now see, barely,

5509
03:42:06.833 --> 03:42:11.171
the open northward barbed fields

5510
03:42:11.171 --> 03:42:13.629
of this side of Xhorhas.

5511
03:42:13.629 --> 03:42:17.687
The faint edges of the Vermaloc Forest, below you,

5512
03:42:17.687 --> 03:42:19.596
the Wildwood.

5513
03:42:20.519 --> 03:42:22.089
You can just, in the distance,

5514
03:42:22.089 --> 03:42:26.339
see faint sparkles of light that represent Rosohna,

5515
03:42:27.309 --> 03:42:32.150
Ghor Dranas, the capital of the Kryn Dynasty.

5516
03:42:33.549 --> 03:42:37.090
Every few moments (crackling)

5517
03:42:37.090 --> 03:42:39.296
arcs of lightning

5518
03:42:39.296 --> 03:42:43.725
that spiral across the sky, through the clouds,

5519
03:42:43.725 --> 03:42:46.007
some down into, and tend to be focused

5520
03:42:46.007 --> 03:42:50.332
towards the barbed fields to the north.

5521
03:42:51.932 --> 03:42:54.174
What do you do?

5522
03:42:57.549 --> 03:42:59.432
ASHLEY: Hello?

5523
03:43:01.952 --> 03:43:05.493
I don't quite know how to do this.

5524
03:43:07.533 --> 03:43:10.925
But I'm trying to learn.

5525
03:43:14.397 --> 03:43:17.683
I feel and I know

5526
03:43:17.683 --> 03:43:21.266
that you are trying to communicate with me.

5527
03:43:23.120 --> 03:43:26.253
But I'm very confused.

5528
03:43:30.388 --> 03:43:33.388
I don't know what these dreams mean.

5529
03:43:35.215 --> 03:43:36.798
And...

5530
03:43:38.322 --> 03:43:40.855
I'm feeling scared.

5531
03:43:43.184 --> 03:43:45.150
But I...

5532
03:43:48.691 --> 03:43:51.608
I want to be an instrument for you.

5533
03:43:54.439 --> 03:43:55.914
And...

5534
03:43:57.789 --> 03:44:01.389
You quite literally saved me and I

5535
03:44:02.381 --> 03:44:03.664
want to do what I can

5536
03:44:03.664 --> 03:44:07.872
and do whatever work that needs to be done.

5537
03:44:11.911 --> 03:44:14.167
Are you there? I don't know if this is the right thing

5538
03:44:14.167 --> 03:44:16.253
that I'm doing, I feel like I'm talking to nothing.

5539
03:44:16.253 --> 03:44:18.545
Are you there?

5540
03:44:22.228 --> 03:44:24.103
MATT: You stand there for a moment

5541
03:44:24.103 --> 03:44:27.361
and see the flashes of light.

5542
03:44:32.078 --> 03:44:34.328
ASHLEY: I think I'm...

5543
03:44:36.151 --> 03:44:37.085
I think I'm most scared

5544
03:44:37.085 --> 03:44:40.168
because I feel like I did something...

5545
03:44:41.370 --> 03:44:44.037
I feel like I did something bad,

5546
03:44:46.327 --> 03:44:48.994
and I don't remember what it is.

5547
03:44:53.920 --> 03:44:58.170
But I think I'm most nervous about what is to come.

5548
03:44:59.104 --> 03:45:02.271
And if I will continue hurting people.

5549
03:45:05.431 --> 03:45:09.598
Maybe that's what you've come to help me with?

5550
03:45:12.391 --> 03:45:14.558
(sighing)

5551
03:45:16.999 --> 03:45:18.832
MATT: There's no response.

5552
03:45:24.208 --> 03:45:25.716
ASHLEY: Well...

5553
03:45:29.345 --> 03:45:32.012
I will continue to follow.

5554
03:45:34.949 --> 03:45:36.103
I will look for signs

5555
03:45:36.103 --> 03:45:40.186
because I think that's what you're supposed to do.

5556
03:45:42.400 --> 03:45:47.400
I know Jester draws things and draws dicks on things,

5557
03:45:47.623 --> 03:45:51.239
but that doesn't feel right.

5558
03:45:54.541 --> 03:45:56.634
(sighing)

5559
03:45:56.634 --> 03:45:59.200
I doodle a dick on the ground.

5560
03:45:59.200 --> 03:46:03.508
(laughter)

5561
03:46:04.986 --> 03:46:07.819
That might be something different.

5562
03:46:13.687 --> 03:46:16.520
I think I'll sit out here tonight.

5563
03:46:22.696 --> 03:46:25.735
Just in case you come back.

5564
03:46:25.735 --> 03:46:27.485
MATT: You stay out here?

5565
03:46:27.485 --> 03:46:28.885
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay outside.

5566
03:46:28.885 --> 03:46:32.093
MATT: Okay. Do you guys?

5567
03:46:32.093 --> 03:46:33.396
SAM: Is she coming back?

5568
03:46:33.396 --> 03:46:35.306
MATT: You watch Yasha sit down

5569
03:46:35.306 --> 03:46:39.179
and lay against the side of the mountain.

5570
03:46:39.179 --> 03:46:42.881
LAURA: Maybe we should sleep, you know, near.

5571
03:46:42.881 --> 03:46:44.132
Just in case something happens.

5572
03:46:44.132 --> 03:46:46.176
SAM: Mm-hmm, okay.

5573
03:46:46.176 --> 03:46:47.328
LAURA: Yeah.

5574
03:46:47.328 --> 03:46:49.130
SAM: Find a little nook to--

5575
03:46:49.130 --> 03:46:54.130
LAURA: Yeah, under some leaves to try to keep dry.

5576
03:46:54.463 --> 03:46:56.634
MATT: Eventually, you guys come to find,

5577
03:46:56.634 --> 03:46:59.635
because the two of you can manage to keep each other warm,

5578
03:46:59.635 --> 03:47:01.649
you manage to find some sleep. As do you.

5579
03:47:01.649 --> 03:47:05.067
You're used to the rugged, uncomfortable spaces of Xhorhas

5580
03:47:05.067 --> 03:47:07.949
and living in the Iothia Moorlands

5581
03:47:07.949 --> 03:47:10.085
is not a comfortable place in comparison

5582
03:47:10.085 --> 03:47:12.330
to where you've been with these people.

5583
03:47:12.330 --> 03:47:15.936
But sleep comes to you.

5584
03:47:15.936 --> 03:47:18.853
In that sleep your wrists get cold.

5585
03:47:21.066 --> 03:47:24.649
Not the rest of your body, just the wrists.

5586
03:47:25.555 --> 03:47:30.055
You try and move your body position

5587
03:47:31.638 --> 03:47:36.006
and you're glancing down and you see

5588
03:47:36.006 --> 03:47:39.931
irons on your wrist.

5589
03:47:44.808 --> 03:47:49.717
You look and you have your withered wings

5590
03:47:49.717 --> 03:47:52.634
draped over each of your shoulders.

5591
03:47:56.797 --> 03:47:59.472
You look forward and all you see is the storm,

5592
03:47:59.472 --> 03:48:01.864
just roiling clouds.

5593
03:48:04.214 --> 03:48:05.677
With the next flash of light,

5594
03:48:05.677 --> 03:48:08.400
you see the clouds part into two

5595
03:48:08.400 --> 03:48:13.041
pale, glowing eyes open before you.

5596
03:48:18.470 --> 03:48:20.595
ASHLEY: You're there.

5597
03:48:22.669 --> 03:48:24.302
Please...

5598
03:48:27.050 --> 03:48:29.517
Please talk to me.

5599
03:48:30.362 --> 03:48:34.091
MATT: You see no mouth, but with the next roll of thunder,

5600
03:48:34.091 --> 03:48:38.006
you hear beneath it this brimming, bassy voice.

5601
03:48:38.006 --> 03:48:39.888
Familiar from some of the visions

5602
03:48:39.888 --> 03:48:42.384
in the past you've experienced.

5603
03:48:42.384 --> 03:48:47.384
It says, "You are still shackled, child."

5604
03:48:52.691 --> 03:48:54.582
ASHLEY: I know.

5605
03:48:57.971 --> 03:49:00.671
Some reasons I know why.

5606
03:49:03.491 --> 03:49:06.833
But other reasons, I do not.

5607
03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:14.736
Have I done something terrible?

5608
03:49:14.736 --> 03:49:17.936
MATT: "We've all done terrible things."

5609
03:49:23.411 --> 03:49:26.578
ASHLEY: These visions that you're giving me.

5610
03:49:31.453 --> 03:49:33.370
Where I see my friends.

5611
03:49:35.171 --> 03:49:37.588
I don't know what that means.

5612
03:49:42.638 --> 03:49:46.230
MATT: "You have done terrible things.

5613
03:49:48.208 --> 03:49:52.641
"You are capable of doing terrible things.

5614
03:49:54.448 --> 03:49:58.031
"Your strength is still not wholly your own.

5615
03:49:59.322 --> 03:50:01.739
"You're still shackled, child.

5616
03:50:05.392 --> 03:50:08.142
"Fight against them.

5617
03:50:11.971 --> 03:50:16.104
"Don't let the iron be your strength."

5618
03:50:19.446 --> 03:50:21.779
ASHLEY: How do I fight against it?

5619
03:50:23.285 --> 03:50:24.202
MATT: "Struggle.

5620
03:50:25.770 --> 03:50:26.603
"Push."

5621
03:50:37.396 --> 03:50:39.154
ASHLEY: Okay.

5622
03:50:41.443 --> 03:50:42.360
MATT: "Struggle.

5623
03:50:45.222 --> 03:50:46.055
"Push."

5624
03:50:48.340 --> 03:50:52.507
ASHLEY: I look down and I try to start pulling it apart.

5625
03:50:53.862 --> 03:50:56.826
MATT: You're pulling and pulling at those chains.

5626
03:50:56.826 --> 03:50:57.965
Make a strength saving throw.

5627
03:50:57.965 --> 03:51:00.132
(gasping)

5628
03:51:01.907 --> 03:51:02.814
MARISHA: Oh my god, oh my god!

5629
03:51:02.814 --> 03:51:04.114
SAM: Break the chains!

5630
03:51:06.845 --> 03:51:08.070
ASHLEY: Okay.

5631
03:51:08.070 --> 03:51:09.354
LAURA: Strength saving throw.

5632
03:51:09.354 --> 03:51:10.187
ASHLEY: Saving throw?

5633
03:51:10.187 --> 03:51:11.322
LAURA: Yeah.

5634
03:51:11.322 --> 03:51:12.514
ASHLEY: Okay.

5635
03:51:14.693 --> 03:51:15.961
22.

5636
03:51:15.961 --> 03:51:17.788
SAM: Ooh!

5637
03:51:17.788 --> 03:51:20.837
MATT: (crunching) The chains grow taut,

5638
03:51:20.837 --> 03:51:24.245
still freezing against your wrists.

5639
03:51:24.245 --> 03:51:25.995
You pull and you pull

5640
03:51:26.927 --> 03:51:31.927
and you can hear the squeaking of iron tensing (squeaking).

5641
03:51:33.709 --> 03:51:36.842
ASHLEY: I start screaming and pulling as much as I can.

5642
03:51:36.842 --> 03:51:39.539
MATT: You pull and you yell into the storm,

5643
03:51:39.539 --> 03:51:43.343
the rain smashing into your face, filling your mouth,

5644
03:51:43.343 --> 03:51:47.354
you scream and you tense in anger as the storm rolls,

5645
03:51:47.354 --> 03:51:48.877
the lightning flashing heavier,

5646
03:51:48.877 --> 03:51:50.893
and the eyes growing brighter.

5647
03:51:50.893 --> 03:51:53.027
"Struggle.

5648
03:51:53.027 --> 03:51:57.110
"Find what gives you your power.

5649
03:52:00.733 --> 03:52:05.583
"Where do you find your strength?"

5650
03:52:09.725 --> 03:52:12.358
ASHLEY: I continue to think of...

5651
03:52:13.958 --> 03:52:17.165
I think of Jester and I think of Beau

5652
03:52:17.165 --> 03:52:19.517
and I think of Fjord.

5653
03:52:19.517 --> 03:52:21.767
And Mollymauk and Caduceus.

5654
03:52:24.566 --> 03:52:26.477
And Nott and Caleb and Zuala

5655
03:52:26.477 --> 03:52:29.644
and I keep pulling and screaming.

5656
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:32.630
MATT: Make a strength saving throw with advantage.

5657
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:34.169
(intense breathing)

5658
03:52:34.169 --> 03:52:35.002
MARISHA: Come on!

5659
03:52:36.371 --> 03:52:37.771
ASHLEY: Okay.

5660
03:52:39.006 --> 03:52:40.297
Oh, I keep rolling,

5661
03:52:40.297 --> 03:52:42.080
I rolled the same number all three times.

5662
03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:43.655
22.

5663
03:52:47.028 --> 03:52:51.533
MATT: The previous weakening of the binds causes the links

5664
03:52:51.533 --> 03:52:55.654
to pull and stretch.

5665
03:52:55.654 --> 03:52:59.517
The metal itself begins to

5666
03:52:59.517 --> 03:53:03.404
wane and twist.

5667
03:53:03.404 --> 03:53:05.887
You can see your withered wings

5668
03:53:05.887 --> 03:53:07.287
begin to feather.

5669
03:53:07.287 --> 03:53:08.730
(gasping)

5670
03:53:08.730 --> 03:53:09.647
SAM: Oh, what?

5671
03:53:13.473 --> 03:53:14.888
MATT: (grunting)

5672
03:53:14.888 --> 03:53:19.888
You pull and the binds do not break,

5673
03:53:20.072 --> 03:53:22.421
and the feathers

5674
03:53:22.421 --> 03:53:23.862
dissipate.

5675
03:53:23.862 --> 03:53:25.922
(sighing)

5676
03:53:27.451 --> 03:53:32.451
In that moment of sorrow and failure, the voice goes...

5677
03:53:35.301 --> 03:53:38.093
"You grow stronger still.

5678
03:53:40.133 --> 03:53:43.300
"Your shackles remain, but they weaken."

5679
03:53:44.715 --> 03:53:46.882
ASHLEY: (sighing)

5680
03:53:48.427 --> 03:53:50.344
MATT: "You know your strength.

5681
03:53:52.830 --> 03:53:54.805
"Use it.

5682
03:53:56.837 --> 03:53:59.395
"And struggle."

5683
03:54:03.042 --> 03:54:05.542
The storm begins to pull away.

5684
03:54:07.362 --> 03:54:10.279
The sound of the thunder dissipate.

5685
03:54:11.778 --> 03:54:13.026
You fall back into a night's rest.

5686
03:54:13.026 --> 03:54:15.193
(gasping)

5687
03:54:18.475 --> 03:54:20.760
LIAM: Exquisite suffering.

5688
03:54:20.760 --> 03:54:23.365
LAURA: Oh man.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

5689
03:54:23.365 --> 03:54:24.804
MATT: That is where we're going to--

5690
03:54:24.804 --> 03:54:26.174
(screaming)

5691
03:54:26.174 --> 03:54:28.731
(thudding)

5692
03:54:28.731 --> 03:54:30.981
MARISHA: (chanting) Yasha! Yasha!

5693
03:54:33.098 --> 03:54:33.931
ASHLEY: Golly!

5694
03:54:35.342 --> 03:54:37.536
MARISHA: Ya-shank Redemption moment.

5695
03:54:37.536 --> 03:54:41.036
ASHLEY: Fuck! (screaming)

5696
03:54:42.925 --> 03:54:44.525
SAM: Oh boy.
TRAVIS: Wow!

5697
03:54:44.525 --> 03:54:45.688
ASHLEY: Holy moly.

5698
03:54:45.688 --> 03:54:47.438
LAURA: Wow, that was awesome.

5699
03:54:47.438 --> 03:54:50.021
MATT: All right, well.

5700
03:54:50.885 --> 03:54:54.869
We'll be picking up in the morning after this scenario

5701
03:54:54.869 --> 03:54:58.120
next week with the completion of this venture

5702
03:54:58.120 --> 03:55:02.200
out with the stone giants of the Penumbra Range,

5703
03:55:02.200 --> 03:55:04.360
outside of the mining camp.

5704
03:55:04.360 --> 03:55:07.897

00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:02.307
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome to Critical Role

00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:03.567
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:05.256
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.256 --> 00:00:08.057
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:09.077
MATT: Yep.

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:11.167
Before we get into our session tonight,

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.787
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:15.974
beginning with the first of our fantastic sponsors tonight,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.533
Skillshare. Sam?

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.767
SAM: Back this week is Skillshare,
an online learning community

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:23.517
with thousands of inspiring classes designed for real life

00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:25.537
and all the circumstances that come along with it,

00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:28.317
including graphic design, creative writing, and music.

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.797
With memberships starting as low as $10 a month

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.097
with annual subscription,

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:33.997
Skillshare is a great way to learn

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:37.047
and unlock your creativity for social good.

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:38.057
As a special offer,

00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:40.717
the first 1000 critters to join Skillshare

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:43.770
by following the link, (breathes)

00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:50.335
skl.sh/criticalrole05211

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:54.304
skl.sh/criticalrole05211

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.687
(laughter)

00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:00.081
will get a free trial of our premium membership.

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.039
MARISHA: Why?

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.364
SAM: Why? (laughter)

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:05.162
LAURA: I feel like they're just trolling you.

00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:06.855
(laughter)

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:08.367
ASHLEY: Is that part of the...

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.057
SAM: No, that's real.
ASHLEY: Okay, good.

00:01:10.057 --> 00:01:11.587
(laughter)

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:14.010
SAM: We asked them to make it a bit.ly. They said no.

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:18.737
One class that I got to check out this week

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:20.929
was Intro to Photography.

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.707
And after a few classes, I don't want to brag,

00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:28.707
but I'm pretty much a Pablo Picasso of photography now.

00:01:29.147 --> 00:01:31.305
I think that tracks.

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:32.967
But why listen to me?

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:36.067
My photographs speak for themselves.

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:37.067
Show me that slide.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:38.717
Oh, look, look at this.

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:40.577
Okay, so this might just look like

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:42.387
a picture of a blurry hand to you,

00:01:42.387 --> 00:01:44.877
but it's really a subversive commentary

00:01:44.877 --> 00:01:48.307
about identity and education reform.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:49.717
Really proud of that one.

00:01:49.717 --> 00:01:51.657
Next slide, please.

00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:53.007
Okay.
(groaning)

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:56.107
I titled that one Regard Mon Visage.

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:58.987
It was shot on 36 millimeter,

00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:01.867
which is one more than 35, which is better.

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.842
MARISHA: Is that a real booger?
LAURA: I can't. I can't.

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:06.337
SAM: No, it's not a booger.

00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:10.347
It's an exploration of artistry in a post-modern society.

00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:12.456
LIAM: It's like Narrative Telephone all over again.
LAURA: Next slide.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:14.447
SAM: Next slide, next slide.

00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:15.302
TRAVIS: (high-pitched scream)

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:18.128
SAM: Oh, oh god, I thought I deleted this one.

00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:20.519
TRAVIS: (continues screaming)

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.323
LIAM: Look at those pasty buns!

00:02:22.323 --> 00:02:24.137
SAM: This is clearly an inspection

00:02:24.137 --> 00:02:27.137
of how social media has replaced human contact.

00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:29.910
Next, next slide, please, please, please.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.127
Please, next slide!

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:33.287
Okay, see, this is just me experimenting

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:35.492
with different tripod placements.

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:36.510
(laughter)

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.727
And it's a metaphor for, uh--

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.757
I don't know, DC statehood?

00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:45.532
I don't know, it's a metaphor for, uh--

00:02:47.527 --> 00:02:48.870
I don't know what it says.

00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:51.670
It's a metaphor for me

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.757
at night taking a bunch of pictures of myself.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.165
Okay, next.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:56.157
(laughter)

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:57.249
Next slide, please.

00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:02.217
Yep, this one is me drowning my sorrows

00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:04.787
because my photos are bad.

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:06.007
I eat my feelings.

00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:07.330
Next slide, please.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.607
I also drink my feelings.
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:12.716
SAM: Next slide, please.

00:03:12.716 --> 00:03:13.907
MARISHA: That's actually a pretty good photo.

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:15.866
SAM: Okay, yeah, great. You know what?

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:18.032
You know what, let's go to the next slide, please.

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:20.357
TRAVIS: Look how far his face is-- (laughter)

00:03:20.357 --> 00:03:22.607
(laughter)

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.773
TRAVIS: Your butt goes in there!

00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:30.440
(laughter)

00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:33.987
TRAVIS: College kids don't get that deep.
SAM: In retrospect,

00:03:33.987 --> 00:03:35.770
I didn't need to get that deep.

00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:38.052
MATT: No, you really didn't.

00:03:38.052 --> 00:03:40.848
TRAVIS: You were in the uranium.

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:42.981
MATT Commit to the bit.
SAM: I could have just

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:44.404
been hovering over it.

00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:47.233
TRAVIS: Something made the leap man, it made the leap.

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:48.316
LIAM: So many roentgens.

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:49.717
SAM: Anyway, this is--

00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:52.391
that's it, the bit's over.

00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:54.377
(laughter)

00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:56.557
Check out Skillshare everyone.

00:03:56.557 --> 00:04:00.215
Learn stuff. Okay, back to you, Matt.

00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:01.662
(laughter)

00:04:01.662 --> 00:04:04.129
TRAVIS: You didn't have to get that-- (laughs)

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.958
MARISHA: Did you just quit out of the bit?

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.266
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: He rip-corded

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:09.577
out of the bit.
MARISHA: He just rip-corded.

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:11.827
LIAM: Doesn't matter.
MATT: I think it's a new one.

00:04:11.827 --> 00:04:13.184
That's a new one.

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:15.161
(laughter)

00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:16.911
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:22.336
TRAVIS: Oh god, that's so down, so far down.

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:24.330
Your ears were almost underneath the seat.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.997
SAM: I clean my toilets.

00:04:25.997 --> 00:04:28.507
Let's get that slide back up, nope.

00:04:28.507 --> 00:04:29.600
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:30.947 --> 00:04:32.447
Thank you, Skillshare.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.819
SAM: Look, I used my car key fob as the slide thing.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:39.870
Improvised prop.

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:42.797
MATT: Whoever finds your car unlocked right now,

00:04:42.797 --> 00:04:43.630
well done.

00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:48.270
Our second sponsor for the night, Ghostfire Gaming.

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:52.077
Fantastic friends, they're sponsoring tonight's show,

00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:53.707
with their soon to be finished campaign

00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:57.047
Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.757
This supplement provides over 400 new dark fantasy themed

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:01.667
monsters for DMs to challenge their players

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.490
and enhance their games at home.

00:05:04.377 --> 00:05:07.267
Each monster provides mechanics for DMs

00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:09.597
to give existing creatures a surprising twist,

00:05:10.607 --> 00:05:12.107
such as making them undead, a fiend,

00:05:12.107 --> 00:05:13.560
or even a legendary creature.

00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:17.257
Also details how characters was can harvest monster parts

00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:19.557
to turn into equipment or magical items to use

00:05:19.557 --> 00:05:21.547
in their campaign, which we've house-ruled before,

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:25.057
but now you can do it from the book specifically.

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:26.251
This campaign is coming to an end,

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:27.467
so make sure you check out everything

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:32.467
at bit.ly/GHMonsters now.

00:05:33.747 --> 00:05:35.357
I didn't have to put my head in the toilet for that one.

00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:36.267
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:37.985
SAM: And what a lovely URL.

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:41.267
MATT: Indeed, and a big thank you to our friends

00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:43.007
and sponsors since the beginning of Campaign 2,

00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:44.026
D&amp;D Beyond.

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:45.809
ALL: (discordant yelling) D&amp;D Beyond!

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.741
MATT: The official tool set of our show.

00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:49.855
One of the things we like about the digital books

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:52.787
on the D&amp;D Beyond is that they're not PDF copies,

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:55.117
they're indexes and links that are really easy to peruse

00:05:55.117 --> 00:05:56.187
beyond having to go and scroll

00:05:56.187 --> 00:05:57.407
through physical books in your hands.

00:05:57.407 --> 00:05:58.977
It's super awesome.

00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:00.067
Makes super quick reference

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:00.900
when you're in the middle of a game,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.347
especially when you're streaming it live,

00:06:02.347 --> 00:06:03.180
which is very helpful.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.330
So check it out now at

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.913
https://dndbeyond.link/critters

00:06:09.913 --> 00:06:13.238
https://dndbeyond.link/critters

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.273
MARISHA: Nice.

00:06:15.273 --> 00:06:16.497
LIAM: Back splash, back splash.

00:06:16.497 --> 00:06:17.955
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:21.912
LIAM: (babbling)

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:24.177
MATT: And thank you all so much for joining us live

00:06:24.177 --> 00:06:25.497
on Twitch and YouTube.

00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:26.630
And of course, reminding you

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.597
that if you want join our live,

00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:30.507
moderated, official chat for our show,

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:33.057
please head on over to our Twitch channel.

00:06:33.057 --> 00:06:34.627
Ashley, you have some announcements, I believe.

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:35.460
ASHLEY: It's me!

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.293
MATT: Yes, it is.

00:06:36.293 --> 00:06:37.897
ASHLEY: I'm still a little queasy to be honest.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.743
TRAVIS: Ashley Johnson!
ASHLEY: Just 'cause

00:06:39.743 --> 00:06:41.967
you had to be really close to the water

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:44.017
with how deep you were in there.

00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:44.882
Anyway.

00:06:44.882 --> 00:06:47.783
SAM: I might have gotten some nose tickle.

00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:49.324
TRAVIS: I think that was under the rim.

00:06:49.324 --> 00:06:53.067
ASHLEY: But hey, thank you so much for your support

00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.467
of our Critical Role Foundation fundraising campaign

00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:57.672
with our friends at 826LA.

00:06:57.672 --> 00:06:59.837
(cheering)

00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:03.947
So since we're prerecording the show, this one,

00:07:03.947 --> 00:07:08.627
the best way to catch-- (sighing)

00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:09.502
oh no.

00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:11.293
(laughter)

00:07:11.293 --> 00:07:13.417
I'm going to get better at this, you guys.

00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:15.557
Okay, we're pre-recording the show

00:07:15.557 --> 00:07:19.896
so the best way to catch real time fundraising updates

00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:24.497
is by following us @CriticalRoleFDN

00:07:24.497 --> 00:07:26.457
on Facebook and Twitter,

00:07:26.457 --> 00:07:28.587
and to learn more about our campaign,

00:07:28.587 --> 00:07:29.957
to build a writer's room

00:07:29.957 --> 00:07:32.457
for students at Venice High School here in Los Angeles,

00:07:32.457 --> 00:07:37.418
or to donate, head on over to criticalrolefoundation.org.

00:07:37.418 --> 00:07:39.019
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:40.720
LAURA: Amazing, Ashley. Good job.
TRAVIS: Well saved.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.553
Well saved.

00:07:41.553 --> 00:07:42.950
MATT: Boom goes the dynamite.

00:07:45.357 --> 00:07:47.446
And Laura, you have something to talk about, too.

00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:49.387
LAURA: Yes, okay, okay, okay.

00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:53.407
So first up we have stuff in all of our stores right now.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:55.710
Hold on, okay, so this is the first thing.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.157
I don't know if you can tell what it is.

00:07:57.157 --> 00:07:59.048
These are temporary tattoos.

00:07:59.048 --> 00:07:59.881
TRAVIS: Tattoosies.

00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:02.627
LAURA: Inspired by the Mighty Nein, I'm going to open it up

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:04.297
so you guys can see some of these things.

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:07.317
You can probably just go online and check it out that way,

00:08:07.317 --> 00:08:10.487
but-- oh wait, that was in the front.

00:08:10.487 --> 00:08:11.957
Ah!

00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:13.457
MARISHA: So cute.
SAM: Those are big!

00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:14.607
LAURA: They're big!

00:08:14.607 --> 00:08:16.317
Yeah, they take up a good amount of space.

00:08:16.317 --> 00:08:18.660
You can put them here.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.397
You can put it here, put it here, anywhere.

00:08:23.397 --> 00:08:26.469
Anyway, check it out they're in our stores.

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:27.807
And the other thing that I'm excited--

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:30.797
oh, these, oh, I should say, I should say who designed them.

00:08:30.797 --> 00:08:33.250
These were designed by--

00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:38.527
I just don't want Ashley to feel alone, you know?

00:08:38.527 --> 00:08:41.070
ASHLEY: Yeah. I thank you for, you know,

00:08:42.695 --> 00:08:45.055
not making me feel alone.

00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:46.388
ASHLEY: (disgusted sigh)

00:08:46.388 --> 00:08:48.822
(laughter)

00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:52.466
LAURA: Savannah Mayer, @well_dipper.

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:53.716
LIAM: @well_dipper!

00:08:54.827 --> 00:08:56.892
This-- this artist's amazing.

00:08:56.892 --> 00:08:58.877
Okay, next thing.

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:00.167
Next thing

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:01.942
is this beanie!

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:03.750
SAM: Oh yes!

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.837
LAURA: I don't if I put it on good,

00:09:04.837 --> 00:09:05.795
I don't have a camera.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.536
TRAVIS: It's on, it's centered.
MATT: You did good!

00:09:07.536 --> 00:09:08.478
ASHLEY: Yeah, you've got it.

00:09:08.478 --> 00:09:10.407
LAURA: Oh, this old slouchy beanie?

00:09:10.407 --> 00:09:12.998
So anyway, it's in the store right now.

00:09:12.998 --> 00:09:14.437
MARISHA: They gave you the vanity.

00:09:14.437 --> 00:09:16.112
LAURA: Hey, look at that.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.925
Go check it out.

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:22.547
(laughter)

00:09:22.547 --> 00:09:24.110
MATT: Thank you very much, Laura.

00:09:25.557 --> 00:09:27.557
SAM: Everyone's bailing on everything.

00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:28.971
ASHLEY: Yeah, we all just--

00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:31.337
can we point out the amazing tie-dye?

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.607
MARISHA: Yeah, I wanted to announce that Marisha Ray

00:09:33.607 --> 00:09:35.197
is really good at tie-dye.
LAURA: She's so good at tie-dye!

00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:37.026
LIAM: Thank you for these shirts.

00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:39.767
MARISHA: You're welcome, you're welcome.

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:42.537
It's been my little Sunday zen.

00:09:42.537 --> 00:09:44.977
You all get tie-dye shirts, just going to chip away.

00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:46.777
Don't look at me like that, Taliesin.

00:09:47.807 --> 00:09:50.590
LAURA: I feel like we should do an online thing.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.075
The critters should show us the tie-dye that they've done.

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:56.184
MARISHA: (gasps) That's a good idea.

00:09:56.184 --> 00:09:57.400
TALIESIN: I love doing tie-dye.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.565
LIAM: How-to video?
LAURA: Ooh.

00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:02.798
MARISHA: (sighs) I'll put that on my to-do list.

00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:03.631
(laughter)

00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:05.737
LIAM: Right at the top, right at the top.

00:10:05.737 --> 00:10:07.487
MARISHA: High priority that one, yep.

00:10:07.487 --> 00:10:08.987
MATT: Indeed.

00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:09.820
All righty.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.664
Well, it seems like the well-oiled machine is--

00:10:12.664 --> 00:10:14.124
(laughter)
TRAVIS: I have a headache now.

00:10:14.124 --> 00:10:16.065
MATT: -- off and ready to go.

00:10:16.987 --> 00:10:19.287
Thank you so much for--

00:10:19.287 --> 00:10:21.695
for hanging with us through those announcements, everybody.

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:24.307
I believe with that, it is time to go ahead

00:10:24.307 --> 00:10:27.748
and jump into tonight's episode of...

00:10:27.748 --> 00:10:29.173
Critical Role.

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:30.275
TALIESIN: (bleating)

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:32.798
(water bubbling)

00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:34.469
(thunder rumbling)

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.207

MATT: And welcome back.

00:12:08.722 --> 00:12:11.450
So last we left off:

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.191
The Mighty Nein, giving chase

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:16.827
towards the two remaining members of the Tomb Takers.

00:12:16.827 --> 00:12:20.377
Lucien, piloting the body of a long dead friend

00:12:20.377 --> 00:12:24.557
that once belonged to him and his companion, Cree.

00:12:24.557 --> 00:12:27.787
They both delved into the Genesis Ward and you gave chase

00:12:28.807 --> 00:12:32.717
following down into the dark open pit

00:12:32.717 --> 00:12:35.867
that once was this portion of the city of Aeor.

00:12:35.867 --> 00:12:40.547
You traversed the subterranean tunnels below, hid stealthily

00:12:40.547 --> 00:12:42.217
from nearby stalking creatures.

00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:45.407
You found odd bits of forgotten technology,

00:12:45.407 --> 00:12:48.717
experimental bits of science and arcana combining,

00:12:48.717 --> 00:12:53.037
went through a commissary, managed to Cabin in the Woods

00:12:53.037 --> 00:12:55.487
a possible encounter and just watch them kill each other

00:12:55.487 --> 00:12:57.757
from across a transparent wall.

00:12:58.617 --> 00:13:03.287
As you began to disable a series of traps in front of you

00:13:03.287 --> 00:13:08.287
as somebody had ransacked a cache of intuit charges

00:13:08.647 --> 00:13:12.937
and laid means of keeping you at bay or worse,

00:13:12.937 --> 00:13:14.567
through a clever use of a few dispels,

00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:16.147
you made your way to the Immensus Gate

00:13:16.147 --> 00:13:19.447
where it seemed both Lucien and Cree were in the process

00:13:19.447 --> 00:13:22.907
of setting the device to allow them to continue

00:13:22.907 --> 00:13:25.110
onto the next step of their journey.

00:13:26.587 --> 00:13:27.487
You stopped and you realized

00:13:27.487 --> 00:13:29.927
that they had set two more intuit charges to detonate

00:13:29.927 --> 00:13:33.370
at Lucien's whim and requested a conversation.

00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:37.697
Carefully, you entered the chamber, spoke a bit

00:13:39.377 --> 00:13:42.857
and allowed them to open the portal just enough

00:13:42.857 --> 00:13:45.217
to let something through from a realm of water

00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:49.107
and then set it to the Astral Sea

00:13:49.107 --> 00:13:52.040
where they leaped through and away.

00:13:52.887 --> 00:13:56.807
The creature that was allowed to step through the sliver.

00:13:56.807 --> 00:13:59.947
This water-based elemental entity began to rise

00:13:59.947 --> 00:14:01.927
through the chamber and attack whatever was nearby,

00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:04.167
which was your troop.

00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:07.287
You fought, but focused instead on escape.

00:14:07.287 --> 00:14:10.117
And one by one managed to slither past it

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:11.467
and through the portal,

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:13.317
some a bit injured,

00:14:13.317 --> 00:14:15.825
some a bit sheepish,

00:14:15.825 --> 00:14:18.537
but with a final moment of success,

00:14:18.537 --> 00:14:20.137
as Jester leapt through

00:14:20.137 --> 00:14:22.047
ensnared by the tentacle of the beast

00:14:22.047 --> 00:14:25.987
and about to be pulled back to further complicate matters,

00:14:25.987 --> 00:14:30.577
a clever use of mage hand shut the portal.

00:14:30.577 --> 00:14:32.257
Severed the bond.

00:14:32.257 --> 00:14:35.427
And allowed the Mighty Nein to arrive in person

00:14:35.427 --> 00:14:39.197
in the Astral Sea, floating just over the view

00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:42.827
of the City of Cognouza.

00:14:42.827 --> 00:14:46.377
So as you all drift,

00:14:46.377 --> 00:14:51.377
looking at the massive island of rock before you,

00:14:51.387 --> 00:14:55.007
numerous long sinewy tethers,

00:14:55.007 --> 00:14:58.827
like jellyfish tentacles of red and purple that drift below,

00:14:58.827 --> 00:15:00.667
you can vaguely see the shadow of another

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:03.877
smaller mass of something, whether it be land, ship

00:15:03.877 --> 00:15:07.277
or creature that is currently tangled within them

00:15:07.277 --> 00:15:11.177
and being pulled up and then above,

00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:12.987
with a bit of light that seems to be coming

00:15:12.987 --> 00:15:14.907
through the nearby gossamer strings

00:15:14.907 --> 00:15:16.947
of the surrounding starscape.

00:15:16.947 --> 00:15:20.730
You can see the beautiful, if ominous, city before you,

00:15:22.737 --> 00:15:23.740
and you're still a sheep.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.239
LIAM: (bleats)

00:15:25.239 --> 00:15:29.437
MATT: So, Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

00:15:29.437 --> 00:15:32.191
MARISHA: Can we see Lucien or the Tomb Takers?

00:15:32.191 --> 00:15:33.747
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:15:33.747 --> 00:15:35.847
TRAVIS: I'm just batting away the sheep pellets.

00:15:37.413 --> 00:15:38.530
LIAM: They're just floating.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.485
MARISHA: 11.

00:15:40.727 --> 00:15:41.860
MATT: 11?

00:15:43.617 --> 00:15:47.820
With the immensity of the space around you,

00:15:48.807 --> 00:15:52.437
there's too much going on on all sides

00:15:52.437 --> 00:15:56.797
and even in a quick anxious glance,

00:15:56.797 --> 00:15:58.947
you cannot make out the direction

00:15:58.947 --> 00:16:03.457
or position of either, not with an 11, unfortunately.

00:16:04.347 --> 00:16:05.794
TALIESIN: Party check, can we see everybody?

00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:08.157
And is everybody heading in the same direction?

00:16:08.157 --> 00:16:09.123
LAURA: Oh yeah.

00:16:10.827 --> 00:16:12.120
MATT: Nobody's moving.

00:16:13.127 --> 00:16:13.960
SAM: Oh.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.087
MATT: Everyone leapt through,

00:16:15.087 --> 00:16:16.937
and once the momentum came to a stop

00:16:16.937 --> 00:16:19.097
everyone's just staying in place.

00:16:19.097 --> 00:16:22.287
LAURA: That's right, you have to think where you want to go.

00:16:22.287 --> 00:16:23.120
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.880
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and flapping my wings.

00:16:26.437 --> 00:16:27.597
MATT: They flap.

00:16:27.597 --> 00:16:29.607
TALIESIN: Do I move or do I just flap in place?

00:16:29.607 --> 00:16:31.844
MATT: The wings just flap in place.

00:16:31.844 --> 00:16:34.197
LAURA: It looks really beautiful, Caduceus.

00:16:34.197 --> 00:16:36.497
TALIESIN: It feels surprisingly good on the shoulders.

00:16:39.577 --> 00:16:41.699
LIAM: Is there any other debris

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:43.517
floating in this sea

00:16:43.517 --> 00:16:48.517
or is it just swirly colors, acid trip, and the city?

00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:50.177
MATT: Looking around in this space, you can see

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:54.327
off in the distance many, many small dark shapes.

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:57.597
And because of the position you currently hold here

00:16:57.597 --> 00:16:59.237
and the lack of detail,

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:02.627
it's extremely challenging to make out any sense of depth.

00:17:02.627 --> 00:17:04.587
They could be very small things that are close

00:17:04.587 --> 00:17:08.057
or massive things that are far, far away,

00:17:08.057 --> 00:17:10.827
but you can see broken bits of rock.

00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:13.257
What looks like chunks of other land masses

00:17:13.257 --> 00:17:15.267
that have been carved free,

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.507
things that resemble lengths of chain

00:17:17.507 --> 00:17:20.127
or tendrils that are severed from something

00:17:20.127 --> 00:17:24.107
that just drift off, cast a little line of shadow.

00:17:24.107 --> 00:17:25.977
You can see puffs of cloud

00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:30.977
and gently, softly gyrating waves

00:17:31.437 --> 00:17:34.012
of silver and glitter

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:38.277
amongst black void-like spaces

00:17:38.277 --> 00:17:42.977
all just slowly shifting and moving.

00:17:42.977 --> 00:17:44.957
TRAVIS: We should link up.

00:17:44.957 --> 00:17:45.790
Keep a hand on each other.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.125
LAURA: I think I want to go towards
Fjord's hand and hold it.

00:17:51.497 --> 00:17:52.946
Did I do it?

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:53.938
SAM: Nope.

00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:55.827
LAURA: I don't know.

00:17:55.827 --> 00:17:57.662
I said it at the wrong time.

00:17:57.662 --> 00:17:59.518
(laughter)

00:17:59.518 --> 00:18:01.857
MATT: Do you will yourself to drift towards his hand?

00:18:01.857 --> 00:18:03.337
LAURA: Okay, yes, I do.

00:18:03.337 --> 00:18:04.917
MATT: Okay.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.465
You shift

00:18:08.447 --> 00:18:10.727
and move in his direction

00:18:10.727 --> 00:18:13.802
at the speed of-- what is your intelligence modifier?

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:17.147
LAURA: Oh no.

00:18:17.147 --> 00:18:18.577
How smart am I?

00:18:18.577 --> 00:18:20.480
Not very, plus one.

00:18:21.717 --> 00:18:22.550
MATT: Okay.

00:18:23.517 --> 00:18:27.890
The speed you travel is three feet a round.

00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:30.722
LAURA: Oh man.

00:18:32.347 --> 00:18:35.837
TALIESIN: So I have an intelligence
modifier of negative one.

00:18:35.837 --> 00:18:37.610
MATT: The wings are not moving you.

00:18:39.028 --> 00:18:40.977
TRAVIS: And neither is anything else.

00:18:40.977 --> 00:18:44.215
MATT: You do have a minimum movement of one foot a round.

00:18:44.215 --> 00:18:45.467
SAM: One foot?

00:18:45.467 --> 00:18:47.887
TRAVIS: I'll try to reach Jester as well, with a plus two.

00:18:47.887 --> 00:18:50.911
Does that mean I'm four feet a round, six feet a round?

00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:52.077
MATT: Six feet a round.

00:18:52.077 --> 00:18:55.440
It is times three, your intelligence modifier, so.

00:18:56.327 --> 00:18:57.767
TRAVIS: I'll link up with Jester

00:18:57.767 --> 00:18:59.737
and try and grab the nearest person that went through

00:18:59.737 --> 00:19:02.367
just before us, which was Yasha, right?

00:19:02.367 --> 00:19:03.200
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.567
TRAVIS: So I'll pull Jester, and will towards her

00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:08.316
and try and grab a foot or a hand.

00:19:08.316 --> 00:19:09.357
LIAM: (bleats)

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.960
ASHLEY: And I'll try to will myself towards them as well.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.597
TALIESIN: I'm going to very slowly make my way

00:19:13.597 --> 00:19:16.117
towards the sheep, since it's the only thing

00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:17.417
moving at the speed I am.

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:19.267
LIAM: I have a negative four modifier

00:19:19.267 --> 00:19:21.757
intelligence at the moment.

00:19:21.757 --> 00:19:23.118
MARISHA: You spin in space.

00:19:23.118 --> 00:19:25.770
(laughter)

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.200
LAURA: Beau is just like--

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.596
TALIESIN: ♪ la la la la la ♪

00:19:29.596 --> 00:19:32.525
LAURA: How long are you going to be a sheep, sheep?

00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:34.775
LIAM: (bleats)

00:19:35.827 --> 00:19:37.417
LAURA: Caleb could be a sheep forever.

00:19:37.417 --> 00:19:39.597
We don't know how this stuff works.

00:19:39.597 --> 00:19:41.979
TRAVIS: We should try and kill the sheep.

00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:43.837
LIAM: Caleb, are going to be a sheep forever?

00:19:43.837 --> 00:19:45.770
You can actually understand me.

00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:48.636
The legs just go like this.

00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:50.707
(bleats)
TALIESIN: I think that's a no.

00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:51.972
LAURA: How would he know?

00:19:51.972 --> 00:19:52.813
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:19:52.813 --> 00:19:54.355
ASHLEY: Should I just grab him?

00:19:54.355 --> 00:19:55.732
TRAVIS: Yes, grab the sheep.
LAURA: Yes, hold onto the sheep.

00:19:55.732 --> 00:19:57.898
ASHLEY: Come here.

00:19:57.898 --> 00:19:58.823
LIAM: (bleating)
ASHLEY: Let's go.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.387
TRAVIS: You scratching his belly?

00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:02.356
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:20:02.356 --> 00:20:04.657
(laughter)

00:20:04.657 --> 00:20:06.357
TRAVIS: Now that we're on this side of the portal

00:20:06.357 --> 00:20:10.687
how-- do we have any sense of distance to this city?

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:13.370
Or is it impossible to tell 'cause space?

00:20:16.647 --> 00:20:20.090
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:20:24.722 --> 00:20:27.257
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, 15.

00:20:27.257 --> 00:20:28.090
MATT: 15.

00:20:30.037 --> 00:20:31.378
You are...

00:20:32.928 --> 00:20:35.911
roughly about two or so miles from the city.

00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:36.744
SAM: Oh boy.

00:20:36.744 --> 00:20:38.527
Two to three miles from it.

00:20:38.527 --> 00:20:40.917
SAM: One foot every six seconds.

00:20:40.917 --> 00:20:41.887
MARISHA: It's going to take...

00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:44.777
SAM: That's ten feet a minute?

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:46.449
LAURA: We're going to be here for a year.

00:20:46.449 --> 00:20:47.637
I don't know, I can't do the math,

00:20:47.637 --> 00:20:49.225
I'm not very intelligent.

00:20:49.225 --> 00:20:53.457
SAM: If there's no friction, right?

00:20:53.457 --> 00:20:56.417
Couldn't the fastest person pull everybody else or no?

00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:57.737
MATT: You could certainly try.

00:20:57.737 --> 00:20:58.570
SAM: Okay.

00:20:59.427 --> 00:21:02.407
So I can go nine feet per round.

00:21:02.407 --> 00:21:04.047
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're fucking talking now.

00:21:04.047 --> 00:21:05.100
MARISHA: I can go 12.

00:21:06.637 --> 00:21:11.203
I think Caleb can end up going 15 when he is not a sheep.

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:12.095
LIAM: (small bleat)

00:21:12.095 --> 00:21:13.827
LAURA: We have to make him not a sheep.

00:21:13.827 --> 00:21:15.885
Caleb!
LIAM: (bleats)

00:21:15.885 --> 00:21:17.643
Will yourself to not be a sheep.

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:19.027
That's how things work here.

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:21.205
Just think "I want to be Caleb."

00:21:21.205 --> 00:21:22.827
LIAM: The ears go up.

00:21:22.827 --> 00:21:24.047
LAURA: Yeah.

00:21:24.047 --> 00:21:26.473
Yeah, I can see you're trying, try harder.

00:21:27.907 --> 00:21:29.687
ASHLEY: Almost got it.

00:21:29.687 --> 00:21:31.157
MARISHA: Man, he's a cute sheep.

00:21:31.157 --> 00:21:32.897
ASHLEY: He's a real cute sheep.

00:21:32.897 --> 00:21:34.317
MARISHA: Maybe he should just stay a sheep.

00:21:34.317 --> 00:21:36.445
It's not a bad ending for him.

00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:38.637
MATT: "It's not a bad ending for him"?

00:21:38.637 --> 00:21:39.497
LIAM: Truth, truth.

00:21:39.497 --> 00:21:40.330
He's been trying.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.667
You watched him do it again and again.

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:43.320
But it always wears off.

00:21:45.417 --> 00:21:50.417
I imagine some grass and hay, like it would be good to eat.

00:21:50.827 --> 00:21:51.660
TALIESIN: Hay.

00:21:53.757 --> 00:21:54.627
MATT: Nothing happens.

00:21:54.627 --> 00:21:55.797
LIAM: I don't dream make it?

00:21:55.797 --> 00:21:56.630
Rats.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.074
MARISHA: I'm going to will myself over.

00:21:59.074 --> 00:22:01.987
MATT: Sorry, intelligence <i>score</i>,
not intelligence modifier.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.575
SAM: Oh!
MATT: That does help.

00:22:03.575 --> 00:22:06.517
I was like, I wrote that wrong on my sheets there.

00:22:06.517 --> 00:22:07.707
LIAM: What's the rule?

00:22:07.707 --> 00:22:08.857
MATT: Sorry.

00:22:08.857 --> 00:22:10.227
MARISHA: Times three?

00:22:10.227 --> 00:22:12.757
MATT: I was like, no that seems way too low.

00:22:12.757 --> 00:22:14.847
So it's three times your intelligence score.

00:22:14.847 --> 00:22:17.796
MARISHA: Well, that's not too bad.
LAURA: Okay, that's better.

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:20.220
MATT: I was like, that doesn't make-
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.677
MATT: Yeah, so-- we'll say from a narrative standpoint

00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:24.302
it took a moment to adjust

00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.567
to the surroundings.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, to figure it out.

00:22:26.567 --> 00:22:27.847
MATT: Now you start picking up some speed.

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:29.097
Like, "Oh, I get it, I get it.

00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:30.637
It's like riding a bike."

00:22:30.637 --> 00:22:32.245
TALIESIN: Don't doggy paddle, all right.

00:22:32.245 --> 00:22:33.944
TRAVIS: 42 feet, cool.

00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:34.917
MARISHA: Can I still test?

00:22:34.917 --> 00:22:36.924
I'm going to go over to Caduceus.

00:22:36.924 --> 00:22:38.827
And just be like, "Here, hold onto my belt."

00:22:38.827 --> 00:22:39.660
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.660
MARISHA: And then can I tug him?

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:44.858
LIAM: Can you?

00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:46.958
MATT: You can.

00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:47.997
MARISHA: Can I tugboat him?

00:22:47.997 --> 00:22:50.307
MATT: You can.
MARISHA: Except that sounds worse, doesn't it?

00:22:52.025 --> 00:22:54.247
SAM: I don't even know what that is, but it seems worse.

00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:56.339
MATT: You can.
TRAVIS: What's the matter with you?

00:22:56.339 --> 00:22:57.777
MARISHA: What?

00:22:57.777 --> 00:23:00.808
SAM: Just floating around, tugboating people.

00:23:00.808 --> 00:23:02.707
TRAVIS: (lip raspberry)

00:23:02.707 --> 00:23:05.697
MARISHA: That's motorboating.
ASHLEY: That's motorboat!

00:23:05.697 --> 00:23:06.807
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:23:06.807 --> 00:23:08.324
(laughter)

00:23:08.324 --> 00:23:09.782
TRAVIS: That's better.

00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:13.757
SAM: Tugboat's from the other side.

00:23:13.757 --> 00:23:17.817
(laughter)

00:23:17.817 --> 00:23:19.367
TALIESIN: Oh no.
LAURA: I'm sorry, Matt.

00:23:20.617 --> 00:23:23.175
LIAM: Aww.
TRAVIS: Which is fitting, given the skit.

00:23:25.727 --> 00:23:27.443
Hey, Veth!

00:23:27.443 --> 00:23:28.293
SAM: What is it?

00:23:28.293 --> 00:23:31.560
TRAVIS: You can see invisible things how far away from you?

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.407
SAM: I can <i>hear</i> invisible things.

00:23:33.407 --> 00:23:34.240
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.390
SAM: 10 feet from me.
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:37.621
Right on you.

00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:40.427
LAURA: But Beau and Caleb can see it

00:23:40.427 --> 00:23:42.887
better than the rest of us now.

00:23:42.887 --> 00:23:44.679
MARISHA: Can Caleb see better? What?

00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:46.827
LAURA: I thought you guys can see invisible things now.

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:47.660
MARISHA: Oh.

00:23:48.907 --> 00:23:50.612
TALIESIN: Caleb, can you see invisible things?

00:23:50.612 --> 00:23:51.598
LIAM: (bleats)

00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:52.813
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

00:23:52.813 --> 00:23:55.197
LIAM: It was seeing in the dark and seeing through illusion.

00:23:55.197 --> 00:23:58.217
MARISHA: Seeing through illusions, okay.

00:23:58.217 --> 00:24:00.907
TRAVIS: Turning back to the door, there's no portal, right?

00:24:00.907 --> 00:24:02.027
TALIESIN: Gone, gone.

00:24:02.027 --> 00:24:03.956
TRAVIS: Can I just make sure that the Tomb Takers

00:24:03.956 --> 00:24:06.943
are not behind us trying to follow us in?

00:24:06.943 --> 00:24:08.177
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:24:11.477 --> 00:24:13.714
TRAVIS: Natural 19 for 22.

00:24:13.714 --> 00:24:14.817
MATT: 22?

00:24:14.817 --> 00:24:19.817
Looking back at where you came, it's just an endless expanse

00:24:19.937 --> 00:24:24.750
of odd textures and shifting bits of nonsensical matter.

00:24:25.667 --> 00:24:26.982
Glancing back towards the city

00:24:26.982 --> 00:24:28.387
and towards the rest of your friends,

00:24:28.387 --> 00:24:31.937
you do make out two shapes

00:24:32.807 --> 00:24:35.017
heading in the direction of the city.

00:24:35.017 --> 00:24:37.697
TRAVIS: Eyes on, wa-a-ay out.

00:24:37.697 --> 00:24:39.367
MATT: They're a ways off

00:24:39.367 --> 00:24:43.551
and you watch as they both divide.

00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:45.317
TRAVIS: What?
LAURA: What?

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:47.237
They're going to send the threshold crests

00:24:47.237 --> 00:24:48.707
into different places.

00:24:48.707 --> 00:24:50.282
That's how they bring the city back.

00:24:50.282 --> 00:24:51.627
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:24:51.627 --> 00:24:53.127
TRAVIS: Shit, are we--

00:24:54.347 --> 00:24:56.937
SAM: How many threshold crests do we think that they have?

00:24:56.937 --> 00:24:57.770
Just two?

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.426
LAURA: They have two, divide and conquer.

00:24:59.426 --> 00:25:02.147
MARISHA: Well-- they can't get it back

00:25:02.147 --> 00:25:03.307
if they only have one.

00:25:03.307 --> 00:25:05.580
So we could just all go after Cree.

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:08.597
TRAVIS: We don't know which one is which.

00:25:08.597 --> 00:25:10.090
SAM: The shapes, which is which?

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.227
MARISHA: Oh, we don't know.

00:25:11.227 --> 00:25:12.414
SAM: Does anyone have--

00:25:13.584 --> 00:25:15.517
You can Dimension Door over to them.

00:25:15.517 --> 00:25:16.917
LAURA: I have 500 feet, yeah.

00:25:16.917 --> 00:25:17.750
TRAVIS: I do, too.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.707
SAM: How far are they away?

00:25:19.707 --> 00:25:21.154
We don't know.
MATT: You don't know.

00:25:21.154 --> 00:25:23.837
LIAM: We also don't know what that would mean, where we are.

00:25:23.837 --> 00:25:25.567
I mean-- (bleats)

00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:27.997
MARISHA: You still have Find the Path, yeah, Cad?

00:25:27.997 --> 00:25:29.717
LAURA: Doesn't it only last a minute?

00:25:29.717 --> 00:25:31.877
TALIESIN: Find the path only works
if we know where we're going.

00:25:31.877 --> 00:25:34.307
If we have something of where we--

00:25:35.595 --> 00:25:38.107
MARISHA: You you can't track the threshold crests?

00:25:38.107 --> 00:25:40.637
TALIESIN: I'd need something of,

00:25:40.637 --> 00:25:43.202
like, I'd need a chunk of threshold crest, or--

00:25:43.202 --> 00:25:45.207
I don't actually know if it would work on an object.

00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:46.727
LAURA: We need a chunk of...

00:25:46.727 --> 00:25:47.907
TALIESIN: Do I have a...

00:25:47.907 --> 00:25:48.973
TRAVIS: Left or right?

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:52.550
Left or right?

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.727
TALIESIN: Left.
MARISHA: Right.

00:25:53.727 --> 00:25:54.863
TRAVIS: I'm a right.

00:25:54.863 --> 00:25:56.157
(laughter)
LIAM: Boulder parchment shears,

00:25:56.157 --> 00:25:57.028
here we go.

00:25:57.028 --> 00:25:58.307
TRAVIS: Anybody want to go left?

00:25:58.307 --> 00:25:59.440
LAURA: I was thinking left as well.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.277
TALIESIN: Left.

00:26:00.277 --> 00:26:01.835
TRAVIS: Two lefts, two rights.
ASHLEY: I was thinking right, too.

00:26:01.835 --> 00:26:02.668
TRAVIS: That's three rights,

00:26:02.668 --> 00:26:04.717
two lefts.
ASHLEY: I feel like Lucien is left.

00:26:05.727 --> 00:26:06.887
SAM: I say right.

00:26:06.887 --> 00:26:08.976
TRAVIS: That's four rights, two lefts.
LIAM: (bleats)

00:26:08.976 --> 00:26:09.809
SAM: Left.
TRAVIS: That's a left.

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:11.244
So four rights.
ASHLEY: Four and four.

00:26:11.244 --> 00:26:13.107
MARISHA: And four lefts? Oh great.

00:26:13.107 --> 00:26:14.915
LAURA: Artagan, which way do you want to go?

00:26:14.915 --> 00:26:15.754
TRAVIS: Essek!

00:26:15.754 --> 00:26:17.337
LAURA: Arty gets a count.

00:26:18.885 --> 00:26:19.958
Right or left?

00:26:21.047 --> 00:26:23.597
MATT: Sprinkle curls out on the shoulder.

00:26:23.597 --> 00:26:26.197
And you watch as, in a similar way,

00:26:26.197 --> 00:26:27.987
now that the pretenses have dropped,

00:26:27.987 --> 00:26:32.867
there's a similar fey glow to the creature

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:36.507
that you've seen in times around Frumpkin, actually.

00:26:36.507 --> 00:26:38.637
There is a similar type energy

00:26:38.637 --> 00:26:42.227
and just so ever so faint arcane aura to it.

00:26:42.227 --> 00:26:47.187
And you watch as the intelligence of a weasel is present.

00:26:47.187 --> 00:26:50.397
And then within a moment, it seems to adjust itself.

00:26:50.397 --> 00:26:54.857
Like the essence of Artagan is stepping into Sprinkle

00:26:55.857 --> 00:26:57.615
before it looks over towards you.

00:26:59.012 --> 00:27:02.837
"My, you certainly found yourself in a bit of a pickle."

00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:06.117
LAURA: Yeah, we're in the Astral Sea.

00:27:06.117 --> 00:27:07.527
Look, there's a horrible city.

00:27:07.527 --> 00:27:10.267
We have to stop it from being delivered.

00:27:10.267 --> 00:27:11.622
MATT: "My apologies, I've never been here.

00:27:11.622 --> 00:27:14.040
"This is wild!"

00:27:14.917 --> 00:27:16.360
LAURA: Right or left?

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.193
MATT: "Uh."

00:27:19.969 --> 00:27:21.036
(die thunks)

00:27:21.036 --> 00:27:22.567
MATT: "Left."
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:27:22.567 --> 00:27:24.087
LAURA: Left, that's what I said.
TRAVIS: Essek, he's the tie break

00:27:24.087 --> 00:27:25.387
since sheep can't talk.

00:27:25.387 --> 00:27:27.049
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:28.494
LIAM: I voted.

00:27:28.494 --> 00:27:30.487
TRAVIS: Oh, you did.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:27:30.487 --> 00:27:31.911
MARISHA: So that makes it left, right?

00:27:31.911 --> 00:27:33.551
LAURA: So Essek gets a vote.

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:35.709
MATT: All right, so Essek gets to vote.

00:27:46.394 --> 00:27:47.922
"Let's try left."

00:27:47.922 --> 00:27:49.447
LAURA: Left.
TRAVIS: Left it is.

00:27:52.647 --> 00:27:54.407
SAM: Okay, we all think left, right?

00:27:54.407 --> 00:27:57.214
TRAVIS: Yeah, Beau, think real fucking hard, let's go.

00:27:57.214 --> 00:27:58.477
MARISHA: (grunts)

00:27:58.477 --> 00:28:00.427
(laughter)

00:28:00.427 --> 00:28:02.207
TRAVIS: (fart noise)

00:28:02.207 --> 00:28:03.613
Well, not that hard.
LAURA: Does it smell do you think?

00:28:03.613 --> 00:28:04.787
Do things smell the Astral Sea?

00:28:04.787 --> 00:28:05.980
How does gas work?

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.697
MARISHA: Yeah, it's true, how does it work?

00:28:07.697 --> 00:28:10.277
TALIESIN: Hey I've got a Divine...

00:28:11.917 --> 00:28:16.617
When was the last time you used your Channel Divinity?

00:28:16.617 --> 00:28:17.450
d100.

00:28:18.078 --> 00:28:19.708
LAURA: Oh, but I want to save it.

00:28:19.708 --> 00:28:21.538
I don't want to use my Channel Divinity

00:28:21.538 --> 00:28:22.878
for choose left or right.

00:28:22.878 --> 00:28:26.221
TALIESIN: I was hoping to just to find exactly--

00:28:26.221 --> 00:28:27.054
LAURA: Where we should go?

00:28:27.054 --> 00:28:28.596
TALIESIN: An idea of exactly where we should go

00:28:28.596 --> 00:28:33.207
to find Cree. Where they're going to drop Cree's--

00:28:33.207 --> 00:28:34.618
TRAVIS: Yeah, because at this point,

00:28:34.618 --> 00:28:36.238
we're all here for the first time.

00:28:36.238 --> 00:28:37.548
LAURA: Yeah.

00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:38.381
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:28:39.338 --> 00:28:40.271
LAURA: Give it a try.

00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:42.291
TALIESIN: All right.

00:28:45.118 --> 00:28:46.425
Can you show me where--

00:28:48.386 --> 00:28:49.748
LAURA: Wait, has it been seven days

00:28:49.748 --> 00:28:51.608
since you used it the last time?

00:28:51.608 --> 00:28:52.958
TALIESIN: I think it has.

00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:54.428
MATT: Wait, since you successfully used it?

00:28:54.428 --> 00:28:55.474
TALIESIN: I think it's been seven.
LAURA: I don't think it's

00:28:55.474 --> 00:28:58.568
been seven days since we used it in the--

00:28:58.568 --> 00:28:59.448
TRAVIS: Blooming Grove?

00:28:59.448 --> 00:29:02.431
LAURA: No, because it worked when we were up in--

00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:03.339
SAM: Blue Man Group?

00:29:03.339 --> 00:29:04.806
TALIESIN: You're right, nevermind.

00:29:04.806 --> 00:29:05.666
Has not been seven days.

00:29:05.666 --> 00:29:06.924
LAURA: I don't think it's been seven days since we did it.

00:29:06.924 --> 00:29:08.108
TALIESIN: I think it's been seven real days.

00:29:08.108 --> 00:29:08.941
All right. We're good.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:09.774
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

00:29:11.741 --> 00:29:14.182
MATT: I could double check into

00:29:14.182 --> 00:29:15.488
our friends at CritRoleStats,

00:29:15.488 --> 00:29:17.203
but it'll take a moment.
TALIESIN: No, I'll call it.

00:29:17.203 --> 00:29:18.870
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: It's been less than a week.

00:29:20.318 --> 00:29:21.198
LAURA: It seems like that, right?

00:29:21.198 --> 00:29:22.976
We've only slept a couple of times.

00:29:22.976 --> 00:29:24.278
TALIESIN: You're still clear.

00:29:24.278 --> 00:29:25.111
LAURA: I'm in the clear.

00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:26.128
Yeah, I could try it.

00:29:26.128 --> 00:29:27.448
TALIESIN: Just got a little easier.

00:29:27.448 --> 00:29:29.438
MATT: Well, you successfully did yours

00:29:29.438 --> 00:29:32.111
before you guys left Eiselcross the first time.

00:29:35.448 --> 00:29:36.878
LAURA: Oh, that's right!

00:29:36.878 --> 00:29:39.087
It was when we were in Eiselcross the first time, because--

00:29:39.087 --> 00:29:41.480
MATT: I feel like it's been a week.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.313
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:43.298
because then we--
SAM: ♪ It's been a while ♪

00:29:43.298 --> 00:29:44.410
LAURA: Has it been a week since then?

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.384
Fuck, I don't know.
TALIESIN: I'll go for it, then.

00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:46.217
All right.
LAURA: Try it.

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:48.364
MATT: I was like-- I think it's been a week at least,

00:29:48.364 --> 00:29:51.148
because you guys have stayed out multiple times

00:29:51.148 --> 00:29:53.518
in multiple cities when you're gathering allies

00:29:53.518 --> 00:29:54.701
and information,

00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:57.856
when you made it to the Blooming Grove and then travel--

00:29:57.856 --> 00:29:59.451
LIAM: When we left we said we have about 10 days.

00:29:59.451 --> 00:30:01.434
LAURA: Yeah, okay, sorry.
MATT: Yeah, I feel like it's been a week.

00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:02.267
LAURA: Sorry, Taliesin.
MATT: If you want to try.

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:03.376
LAURA: I thought it was--
TALIESIN: No, I thought you

00:30:03.376 --> 00:30:04.780
were right, too.
SAM: Do we want to wait?

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.816
TALIESIN: All right, let's--

00:30:05.816 --> 00:30:07.267
MARISHA: ♪ It's been a week ♪

00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:08.628
TALIESIN: ♪ Been a week ♪

00:30:08.628 --> 00:30:09.979
Boy, it's been a week.

00:30:10.838 --> 00:30:15.678
All right, I would like to be guided to the location

00:30:15.678 --> 00:30:19.453
of where Cree needs to bring

00:30:19.453 --> 00:30:21.744
the threshold crest.

00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:26.181
My brain, boy, no.

00:30:26.181 --> 00:30:28.008
(laughter)

00:30:28.008 --> 00:30:29.883
TALIESIN: That was a lot of

00:30:29.883 --> 00:30:31.216
unintelligible words for nothing.

00:30:31.216 --> 00:30:32.808
MATT: You quietly pray

00:30:32.808 --> 00:30:36.718
and you can sense the Wild Mother is reaching out

00:30:36.718 --> 00:30:40.798
to you, but the connection you normally maintain seems

00:30:40.798 --> 00:30:45.318
to be slightly obscured and fuzzed by the current proximity

00:30:45.318 --> 00:30:46.931
of the Astral Sea.
TALIESIN: Very fair.

00:30:49.438 --> 00:30:50.271
Worth a shot.

00:30:51.958 --> 00:30:53.718
TRAVIS: We're going left.

00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:56.468
We could gain a thousand feet, but it would burn spells,

00:30:56.468 --> 00:30:59.652
and I don't know how much closer

00:30:59.652 --> 00:31:01.538
that would actually get us.

00:31:01.538 --> 00:31:04.018
Well, we could all get a 500 feet closer.

00:31:04.018 --> 00:31:05.638
TALIESIN: I think it'd be better to let them separate a bit

00:31:05.638 --> 00:31:08.038
more before we try anything.

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:10.846
LIAM: Caleb is chewing on Yasha's coat.
LAURA: They know we're following them.

00:31:10.846 --> 00:31:13.166
It seems weird that Lucien would just let Cree go off

00:31:13.166 --> 00:31:15.008
and not protect him.

00:31:16.118 --> 00:31:17.868
TALIESIN: Faster to get it done.
MARISHA: He doesn't care.

00:31:17.868 --> 00:31:20.388
LAURA: But he needs both of the crests delivered.

00:31:20.388 --> 00:31:21.998
Just doesn't seem--

00:31:21.998 --> 00:31:23.089
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:31:25.439 --> 00:31:27.830
Anything could be a trap at this point, too.

00:31:30.738 --> 00:31:32.828
SAM: Yeah, but we just got to pick a direction and go.

00:31:32.828 --> 00:31:35.960
MARISHA: Left, I guess, it is.
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.743
MATT: All right, so for you,

00:31:39.743 --> 00:31:41.384
you would be the slowest member of the team,

00:31:41.384 --> 00:31:42.718
but you are--

00:31:42.718 --> 00:31:43.618
TALIESIN: 27 feet.

00:31:43.618 --> 00:31:46.393
MATT: Correct, so mostly your walking speed while flying

00:31:47.678 --> 00:31:48.728
and what's the sheep's?

00:31:48.728 --> 00:31:49.561
TALIESIN: I'm actually walking.

00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:51.058
LIAM: Oh, negative four.

00:31:51.058 --> 00:31:52.988
MATT: So you probably have to drag the sheep along as well.

00:31:52.988 --> 00:31:54.358
TALIESIN: I'm still holding him.
LIAM: Yasha's got it.

00:31:54.358 --> 00:31:55.858
MATT: Cool, all right.

00:31:55.858 --> 00:31:57.928
So that being the case, as you all begin to will yourself

00:31:57.928 --> 00:31:59.378
in the direction of the city,

00:32:01.438 --> 00:32:05.278
noiselessly, frictionlessly,

00:32:05.278 --> 00:32:08.978
you all begin to drift with imagined flight

00:32:08.978 --> 00:32:13.391
and locomotion towards the city of Cognouza below.

00:32:14.878 --> 00:32:18.178
Slowly, it begins to come more into focus,

00:32:18.178 --> 00:32:21.881
and as you now have a sense of movement and its approach,

00:32:22.798 --> 00:32:27.491
you get a sense of the sincere mass of this location.

00:32:30.688 --> 00:32:33.788
It's larger than you expected for being just a portion,

00:32:33.788 --> 00:32:36.788
a ward of the city of Aeor and some of the other wards

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.388
that you had experienced for your time in the ruins.

00:32:40.988 --> 00:32:42.978
Those of you of discerning eyes

00:32:42.978 --> 00:32:46.648
can see some repeated pattern

00:32:46.648 --> 00:32:48.641
in different neighborhood layouts,

00:32:50.748 --> 00:32:53.558
like certain street arrangements and structures

00:32:53.558 --> 00:32:58.558
that seemed very unique seem to be repeating elsewhere.

00:32:58.628 --> 00:33:00.783
LIAM: Like Fibonacci spirals in the road?

00:33:00.783 --> 00:33:02.532
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:06.090
Like as the city has slowly expanded over the time

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.398
that it's brought its consciousness together

00:33:08.398 --> 00:33:11.038
and swallowed things in the Astral Sea,

00:33:11.038 --> 00:33:13.483
it's begun to replicate itself--

00:33:13.483 --> 00:33:14.933
MARISHA: Carbon copy itself?

00:33:14.933 --> 00:33:16.341
MATT: -- as it expands.

00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:18.998
LIAM: And I know I'm just a sheep,

00:33:18.998 --> 00:33:21.728
but are the buildings that we're seeing

00:33:21.728 --> 00:33:25.088
larger than normal buildings or just there's many buildings

00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:26.998
that have multiplied out the same way

00:33:26.998 --> 00:33:29.168
that the roads have duplicated?

00:33:29.168 --> 00:33:30.001
MATT: From what you can tell,

00:33:30.001 --> 00:33:31.478
now that you've traveled quite a bit,

00:33:31.478 --> 00:33:36.278
they appear to be sized for normal humanoid folk,

00:33:36.278 --> 00:33:40.108
just numerous, numerous neighborhoods

00:33:41.148 --> 00:33:42.271
and beautiful.

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:47.318
You can't help but be struck by a bit of awe

00:33:47.318 --> 00:33:50.238
to see after how much of the ruined the city of Aeor you'd

00:33:50.238 --> 00:33:52.988
been trudging through in the dark beneath

00:33:54.108 --> 00:33:57.518
to now get a glimpse of what it would look like

00:33:57.518 --> 00:34:02.408
in its heyday, and it's gorgeous.

00:34:02.408 --> 00:34:04.088
You can see where there was a prominence

00:34:04.088 --> 00:34:06.258
and to a certain extent,

00:34:06.258 --> 00:34:11.258
the arrogance that would ensue from being responsible

00:34:11.358 --> 00:34:14.451
for a society that looks this erudite.

00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:21.108
Still further, you drift and drift and closer

00:34:21.108 --> 00:34:23.908
and closer still, following the left-hand path, you said.

00:34:24.908 --> 00:34:26.978
LAURA: Can we tell if we're following Cree

00:34:26.978 --> 00:34:28.718
or Lucien at this point?

00:34:28.718 --> 00:34:30.608
MATT: I will require whoever's taking point

00:34:30.608 --> 00:34:32.348
to maintain another perception check

00:34:32.348 --> 00:34:33.604
to see if they can keep a bead

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:34.553
on the movement.
TALIESIN: I'm in the back.

00:34:34.553 --> 00:34:35.386
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:34:35.386 --> 00:34:37.158
LAURA: It was either Beau or Fjord.

00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.868
MARISHA: I'm so bad at this.

00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:40.468
Can I assist Fjord?

00:34:40.468 --> 00:34:41.301
MATT: If you'd like to.

00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:44.218
MARISHA: I'll assist Fjord, just scanning on the horizon,

00:34:44.218 --> 00:34:45.702
seeing if I can spot movement?

00:34:45.702 --> 00:34:47.388
MATT: All right, between the two of you,

00:34:47.388 --> 00:34:48.918
perception check with advantage.

00:34:48.918 --> 00:34:49.870
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.572
SAM: Ooh.
LIAM: Yes.

00:34:51.572 --> 00:34:53.071
ASHLEY: Yes.
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

00:34:54.768 --> 00:34:56.178
TRAVIS: Oh, for a 23.

00:34:56.178 --> 00:34:57.108
MATT: That's great.

00:34:57.108 --> 00:35:00.728
Keeping a bead on this figure,

00:35:00.728 --> 00:35:02.968
this one figure that's darting off

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:06.259
and making their way towards a portion of the city--

00:35:06.259 --> 00:35:07.728
LIAM: ♪ Making their way ♪

00:35:07.728 --> 00:35:09.458
MATT: You stayed trained on,

00:35:09.458 --> 00:35:11.068
and the rest of you shift with Fjord,

00:35:11.068 --> 00:35:14.288
this slow moving flock of the Mighty Nein adjusting

00:35:14.288 --> 00:35:17.658
as he does, getting closer and closer,

00:35:17.658 --> 00:35:20.108
and eventually you begin to find yourselves

00:35:20.108 --> 00:35:22.058
above the first parts of the city,

00:35:22.058 --> 00:35:24.498
where you're now looking down upon the streets

00:35:24.498 --> 00:35:25.673
and neighborhoods.

00:35:25.673 --> 00:35:27.439
Impossibly intricate and beautiful

00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:29.608
white cobblestone streets,

00:35:29.608 --> 00:35:33.818
buildings and tall multistory structures and abodes,

00:35:33.818 --> 00:35:36.568
residential spaces that are entwined with bridges,

00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:40.681
and thin, tall towers that come to these intricate peaks.

00:35:42.138 --> 00:35:46.761
The streets are barren, empty,

00:35:47.983 --> 00:35:51.448
a frozen point in time without the people,

00:35:51.448 --> 00:35:56.314
just an expression of what's there

00:35:56.314 --> 00:35:58.803
minus the society.

00:35:58.803 --> 00:35:59.703
SAM: Weird.

00:35:59.703 --> 00:36:01.958
LAURA: Do the buildings have eyeballs

00:36:01.958 --> 00:36:04.984
like we've seen some of them going (squishing)?

00:36:04.984 --> 00:36:08.078
MATT: You swear you saw that from a distance

00:36:08.078 --> 00:36:10.348
but none were that large,

00:36:10.348 --> 00:36:12.278
and that vision specifically, I should have specified,

00:36:12.278 --> 00:36:14.566
was to the two of you,

00:36:16.468 --> 00:36:19.569
but from this distance, you would not be able to tell.

00:36:19.569 --> 00:36:22.018
The detail is way too small.

00:36:22.018 --> 00:36:23.808
TRAVIS: And the tendrils that hang underneath the city,

00:36:23.808 --> 00:36:25.728
they just continue to hang.

00:36:25.728 --> 00:36:29.638
They don't start to reach out and pull, do they?

00:36:29.638 --> 00:36:31.551
MATT: You don't see anything like that, no.

00:36:33.168 --> 00:36:34.468
TRAVIS: Fuck.
MATT: About this time,

00:36:34.468 --> 00:36:36.718
as you're keeping a train on this individual,

00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:42.181
a voice rings through all of your minds simultaneously,

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:45.943
"Welcome,

00:36:45.943 --> 00:36:48.709
"guests, minds,

00:36:49.942 --> 00:36:51.525
"kin.

00:36:53.145 --> 00:36:54.940
"So rare.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.233
"(echoing) Rare, rare --

00:36:57.233 --> 00:37:02.130
"Welcome, welcome, welcome us home."

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.553
SAM: Nope.

00:37:05.553 --> 00:37:06.928
LIAM: (bleats)

00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:07.918
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:37:07.918 --> 00:37:09.155
ASHLEY: Do we all hear this?

00:37:09.155 --> 00:37:11.328
MATT: You all hear this.

00:37:11.328 --> 00:37:12.808
LAURA: We have to destroy this city.

00:37:12.808 --> 00:37:16.771
MATT: You glance down after you all look at each other

00:37:18.448 --> 00:37:20.044
and now there's people in the streets.

00:37:20.044 --> 00:37:21.896
SAM: Oh, what?

00:37:24.348 --> 00:37:28.028
MARISHA: Where they're-- like unnaturally,

00:37:28.028 --> 00:37:30.338
like there's no way this many people could have rushed

00:37:30.338 --> 00:37:32.158
into the street this quickly?

00:37:32.158 --> 00:37:34.378
MATT: For a moment, you all looked at each other

00:37:34.378 --> 00:37:35.818
and began to move forward and glanced down,

00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:37.978
and now, it's a bustling cityscape.

00:37:37.978 --> 00:37:40.288
You see people just walking in pairs

00:37:40.288 --> 00:37:43.458
or solo groups and picking up things

00:37:43.458 --> 00:37:46.538
and pulling carts and just going about their business.

00:37:46.538 --> 00:37:49.368
MARISHA: Do they look corrupt or--?

00:37:49.368 --> 00:37:51.198
MATT: You're too far up to make any sort

00:37:51.198 --> 00:37:53.028
of perspective view of that.

00:37:53.028 --> 00:37:54.368
You'd have to get closer.

00:37:54.368 --> 00:37:55.201
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:56.518
TALIESIN: Is there anything following us

00:37:56.518 --> 00:38:00.778
or coming in from any other side from the void?

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:02.078
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:38:03.646 --> 00:38:04.479
TALIESIN: 25.

00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:06.354
MATT: 25!
SAM: Jeez.

00:38:07.354 --> 00:38:08.216
MATT: No.

00:38:08.216 --> 00:38:09.168
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:38:09.168 --> 00:38:13.038
MATT: No, nothing in your entire--

00:38:13.038 --> 00:38:13.871
TALIESIN: I did a little twirl.

00:38:13.871 --> 00:38:16.353
MATT: -- periphery catches your eye.

00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:21.079
LAURA: And just to be clear,

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:23.326
are a lot of us still pretty busted up

00:38:23.326 --> 00:38:24.209
from that fight?

00:38:24.209 --> 00:38:25.318
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:38:25.318 --> 00:38:26.578
LAURA: We haven't healed or anything.

00:38:26.578 --> 00:38:27.411
TALIESIN: Nope.

00:38:27.411 --> 00:38:28.548
LAURA: I don't think we should set foot

00:38:28.548 --> 00:38:30.488
down in that city if we haven't.

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:34.578
SAM: Where's the individual going?

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:39.578
MATT: Slowly coasting down towards the city itself.

00:38:39.636 --> 00:38:41.598
TALIESIN: We do have a mansion.

00:38:41.598 --> 00:38:43.388
We have the tower we can hit.

00:38:43.388 --> 00:38:44.621
LAURA: Well, we have a sheep.

00:38:46.368 --> 00:38:49.318
Can I use a medicine check on him to see

00:38:49.318 --> 00:38:52.478
if I can see people skin coming through?

00:38:52.478 --> 00:38:53.311
Does he look like

00:38:53.311 --> 00:38:55.469
he's going to be a sheep forever?
MATT: Sure, make a medicine check.

00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:56.728
SAM: We could just hit him real hard.

00:38:56.728 --> 00:38:57.619
LIAM: Punch me in the nose.
LAURA: I don't know.

00:38:57.619 --> 00:38:59.218
Is it like a Polymorph sort of thing

00:38:59.218 --> 00:39:01.207
or is it True Polymorph?
TALIESIN: Only one way to find out.

00:39:01.207 --> 00:39:02.831
SAM: Got to be.

00:39:02.831 --> 00:39:05.266
TRAVIS: He did say if he changed--
LAURA: 26.

00:39:05.266 --> 00:39:06.515
TRAVIS: (sword humming)

00:39:06.515 --> 00:39:09.552
(laughter)

00:39:09.552 --> 00:39:12.165
SAM: He didn't mean this!
LIAM: Shanked!

00:39:12.165 --> 00:39:14.445
TRAVIS: Lamb shanks!

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:16.619
LAURA: 26.

00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:20.261
MATT: 26, physically seems like a sheep.

00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:22.440
TALIESIN: You know, I'm just going to take initiative.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.878
May I?

00:39:23.878 --> 00:39:24.711
ASHLEY: What?

00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:27.398
LIAM: (bleats)
TALIESIN: You'll thank me later.

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:29.227
I'm just going to bap the sheet.

00:39:29.227 --> 00:39:30.568
TRAVIS: You punch the sheep!

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.575
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit the sheep with the stick.

00:39:32.575 --> 00:39:34.358
TRAVIS: Yes you do!
MATT: Okay, roll an attack.

00:39:34.358 --> 00:39:35.368
TALIESIN: All right.

00:39:35.368 --> 00:39:37.097
TRAVIS: Crack that damn sheep.

00:39:37.097 --> 00:39:37.930
TALIESIN: It's cracking.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.333
LAURA: This feels like an Aesop's fable or something.

00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:41.175
LIAM: You crack it open, and a wizard comes out.

00:39:41.175 --> 00:39:43.668
(laughter)

00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:45.275
TALIESIN: That's a-- I don't do this very often.

00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:47.608
TRAVIS: You better be able to hit a sheep.

00:39:47.608 --> 00:39:49.173
TALIESIN: That's a 17 to--

00:39:49.173 --> 00:39:51.008
SAM: Oh, pretty good, pretty good.

00:39:51.008 --> 00:39:51.966
TALIESIN: Hold on.
TRAVIS: That hits me.

00:39:51.966 --> 00:39:55.049
LIAM: I don't think you had to hit me that hard.

00:39:56.158 --> 00:39:57.145
MATT: That definitely hits.

00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:57.978
LAURA: FLames.

00:39:57.978 --> 00:39:58.811
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:00.361
LAURA: Flames on the side of my face.

00:40:00.361 --> 00:40:01.277
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was trying to figure out--

00:40:01.277 --> 00:40:02.937
TRAVIS: Flames, side of my face.
TALIESIN: -- how my attacks work because I

00:40:02.937 --> 00:40:04.445
never use them anymore.

00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:09.130
LIAM: (high-pitched) I hate him so much!
ASHLEY: I'm keeping him on my hip.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.288
TALIESIN: You know, for some reason

00:40:10.288 --> 00:40:12.930
it doesn't say, but that's okay.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:13.846
ASHLEY: Give him a little pat on the nose.

00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:15.243
MATT: It's your staff. It should be a 1d8

00:40:15.243 --> 00:40:16.118
plus your strength modifier.

00:40:16.118 --> 00:40:16.951
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you.

00:40:16.951 --> 00:40:20.628
LIAM: Yeah, three hit points was all you needed.

00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:23.597
TALIESIN: That's 1d8 plus my strength modifier?

00:40:23.597 --> 00:40:25.018
MATT: Or 1d6, your choice--

00:40:25.018 --> 00:40:25.998
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: -- because one-handed

00:40:25.998 --> 00:40:28.228
or two-handed is how that would work.

00:40:28.228 --> 00:40:29.558
TALIESIN: Six points.

00:40:29.558 --> 00:40:33.088
MATT: Okay, so you have three hit points as a sheep.

00:40:33.088 --> 00:40:36.047
So Caleb takes three points of bludgeoning damage.

00:40:36.047 --> 00:40:36.880
TRAVIS: Hey!

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.598
MATT: As the sheep form reverts--

00:40:38.598 --> 00:40:40.858
TALIESIN: You take two points, because it was a five.

00:40:40.858 --> 00:40:42.748
I forgot to remove one.

00:40:42.748 --> 00:40:43.708
MATT: You got it.
LIAM: Okay.

00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:44.541
LAURA: Oh, hey, you're back.

00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:45.755
Good work, Caduceus!

00:40:45.755 --> 00:40:47.255
LIAM: Thank you, I think.

00:40:47.255 --> 00:40:48.313
TALIESIN: I'm learning from you guys.

00:40:48.313 --> 00:40:51.258
If it's a real problem, you just smack it.

00:40:51.258 --> 00:40:52.166
MARISHA: Right?
ASHLEY: Do you want me to still

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:54.066
hold onto you or should I let you go?

00:40:54.066 --> 00:40:57.308
LIAM: Oh, no. Well, maybe just for a moment.

00:40:57.308 --> 00:41:00.367
ASHLEY: I got you, big boy.
LIAM: I'm kind of beat up.

00:41:00.367 --> 00:41:01.578
TRAVIS: I don't know how much you were tracking.

00:41:01.578 --> 00:41:04.968
We are following that individual if you can see.

00:41:07.035 --> 00:41:08.631
It seems the two of them split up.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.658
SAM: Does anyone have a telescope or anything?

00:41:12.658 --> 00:41:15.428
MARISHA: Oh my god, I do.

00:41:15.428 --> 00:41:17.068
I have Avantika's spyglass.

00:41:17.068 --> 00:41:20.365
I forgot about that.
ALL: Oh!

00:41:20.365 --> 00:41:21.548
TRAVIS: Let's go!
SAM: Pop it open!

00:41:21.548 --> 00:41:23.214
LAURA: Use it!
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's not cursed at all.

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:26.038
SAM: Come on, space pirate!
MARISHA: (clicking)

00:41:26.038 --> 00:41:28.168
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check with advantage.

00:41:28.168 --> 00:41:29.870
MARISHA: Ooh, it's probably--

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.215
LAURA: Guidance, I'm guiding her.
MARISHA: -- still going to be bad.

00:41:31.215 --> 00:41:32.573
LAURA: I'm patting her back.
MARISHA: Ooh, Guidance.

00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:33.948
SAM: Ooh!
MARISHA: Ooh!

00:41:33.948 --> 00:41:35.451
MATT: Ooh!

00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:36.748
LAURA: In fact, I'm trying to pat her back,

00:41:36.748 --> 00:41:38.487
but Sprinkle runs up

00:41:38.487 --> 00:41:39.828
and pats he back as well.

00:41:39.828 --> 00:41:41.120
We're both patting her back.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.738
MATT: Okay.

00:41:42.738 --> 00:41:46.628
MARISHA: Okay, 20 total.

00:41:46.628 --> 00:41:47.461
MATT: 20 total, okay.

00:41:47.461 --> 00:41:49.948
With the spyglass, now that you've followed behind,

00:41:49.948 --> 00:41:52.158
and you've come both hovered down closer

00:41:52.158 --> 00:41:53.508
to the top of the cityscape,

00:41:53.508 --> 00:41:57.358
the tower peaks and apexes beginning to get close

00:41:57.358 --> 00:41:58.688
to brushing where you're gliding

00:41:58.688 --> 00:42:01.948
down towards the over end portion

00:42:01.948 --> 00:42:04.167
of the left-hand (burps), pardon, side of the city.

00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:05.198
LAURA: (laughs)

00:42:05.198 --> 00:42:07.131
MATT: That's the problem with eating before we play.

00:42:09.348 --> 00:42:12.528
You see the figure dart down

00:42:12.528 --> 00:42:16.748
over some buildings and vanish into the city below.

00:42:16.748 --> 00:42:19.488
What you do catch as well with the spyglass

00:42:19.488 --> 00:42:21.428
is of the shape that drifts down,

00:42:21.428 --> 00:42:23.608
you see the hint of a tail behind.

00:42:23.608 --> 00:42:25.508
MARISHA: What?
SAM: They both have tails.

00:42:25.508 --> 00:42:28.841
MARISHA: I don't think Lucien did.

00:42:28.841 --> 00:42:31.508
MATT: Lucien has a tail.
LAURA: Yeah, I have a tail.

00:42:31.508 --> 00:42:33.491
I swing my tail up.
TRAVIS: I though Cree was a tabaxi?

00:42:33.491 --> 00:42:34.998
LAURA: We have tails.

00:42:34.998 --> 00:42:38.338
MARISHA: Right, so does Cree also have a tail, though?

00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:39.171
SAM: Yeah.

00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:40.004
MARISHA: They both have tails?

00:42:40.004 --> 00:42:42.528
LAURA: Was it a furry tail or a smooth-looking tail?

00:42:42.528 --> 00:42:44.303
MARISHA: Was it a furry tail or

00:42:44.303 --> 00:42:46.228
did it have a little--?

00:42:46.228 --> 00:42:47.728
MATT: It's hard to tell with a 20.

00:42:48.707 --> 00:42:49.658
TRAVIS: Should've rolled higher.
LAURA: Did it seem like

00:42:49.658 --> 00:42:51.908
it was a thick tail or skinny tail?

00:42:51.908 --> 00:42:53.449
MARISHA: Does it seem like it was the thick tail

00:42:53.449 --> 00:42:54.282
or a skinny tail?

00:42:54.282 --> 00:42:56.038
LIAM: We could do this all day.
SAM: Hard to tell with a 20.

00:42:56.038 --> 00:42:58.338
MATT: Yeah.

00:42:58.338 --> 00:42:59.558
MARISHA: Someone with a tail, okay.

00:42:59.558 --> 00:43:01.977
SAM: It was in the reddish-purplish tone.

00:43:01.977 --> 00:43:04.468
(laughter)

00:43:04.468 --> 00:43:05.838
MARISHA: Cool, cool.

00:43:05.838 --> 00:43:07.613
Wish I would have been using this spyglass

00:43:07.613 --> 00:43:10.068
this entire campaign since I've had it.

00:43:10.068 --> 00:43:11.458
Kind of forgot I had it.

00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:13.556
So that's cool, great.

00:43:13.556 --> 00:43:16.728
SAM: (laughs)

00:43:16.728 --> 00:43:19.215
TRAVIS: If you forget to use it going forward, you suck.

00:43:19.215 --> 00:43:21.561
MARISHA: Yeah, yes, thank you, yeah.

00:43:22.793 --> 00:43:24.451
SAM: Well, we just keep going.
MARISHA: Okay, well, he went--

00:43:24.451 --> 00:43:27.188
whatever, whoever it was went down there.

00:43:27.188 --> 00:43:29.618
SAM: But we're saying we don't want to go down there

00:43:29.618 --> 00:43:31.218
while we're not healed, right?

00:43:31.218 --> 00:43:33.378
Should we just get far enough before we stop?

00:43:33.378 --> 00:43:34.948
TALIESIN: Caleb, do you have enough for the tower?

00:43:34.948 --> 00:43:36.318
LIAM: I do not, no.

00:43:36.318 --> 00:43:37.438
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

00:43:37.438 --> 00:43:40.558
TRAVIS: Yeah, the hard part is if we lose sight,

00:43:40.558 --> 00:43:41.428
we're just guessing.

00:43:41.428 --> 00:43:44.868
LIAM: It's a city full of maybe people.

00:43:44.868 --> 00:43:46.534
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: We should keep following?

00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:47.367
TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah.

00:43:47.367 --> 00:43:49.318
TALIESIN: We need to get somewhere where we won't lose it,

00:43:49.318 --> 00:43:51.544
but also, we need to rest really, really badly.

00:43:51.544 --> 00:43:53.435
MARISHA: As long as we just follow.
LAURA: How are we going to rest?

00:43:53.435 --> 00:43:54.268
How will we rest?

00:43:54.268 --> 00:43:55.668
If we sleep for eight hours,

00:43:56.668 --> 00:43:58.620
he's going to bring the city back.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.931
We're going to wake up and we'll be back in Exandria.

00:44:02.064 --> 00:44:03.784
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're just going to have to keep pushing

00:44:03.784 --> 00:44:05.242
unless there's a moment.
SAM: Yeah.

00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:06.075
TALIESIN: Pushing for the moment--

00:44:06.075 --> 00:44:08.134
SAM: I've got a health potion if anyone needs it

00:44:08.134 --> 00:44:10.478
in dire straights.

00:44:10.478 --> 00:44:12.328
TALIESIN: I could burn a spell if
you really need to get the--

00:44:12.328 --> 00:44:13.268
LAURA: I know, I could, too,

00:44:13.268 --> 00:44:15.446
but I am real shit at curing people,

00:44:15.446 --> 00:44:17.388
but I could burn a spell.

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.671
TALIESIN: I'll burn a spell.

00:44:21.198 --> 00:44:22.478
How, how--

00:44:22.478 --> 00:44:23.903
LIAM: Currently less than half.

00:44:25.248 --> 00:44:26.081
TALIESIN: Less than half?

00:44:26.081 --> 00:44:27.618
TRAVIS: Yasha's real fucked

00:44:27.618 --> 00:44:29.458
TALIESIN: So a full heal spell might be--

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:30.291
TRAVIS: 16.

00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:31.668
MARISHA: I'm a little over half.

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:33.868
LAURA: We could do a Mass Cure Wounds.

00:44:33.868 --> 00:44:35.691
That's a fifth, though.

00:44:35.691 --> 00:44:38.128
TALIESIN: Yeah, actually what's the 10 minute one?

00:44:38.128 --> 00:44:41.258
SAM: Yeah, we'd be back--
LAURA: That's a Prayer of Healing.

00:44:41.258 --> 00:44:43.408
TALIESIN: Do a Prayer of Healing, but that's a--

00:44:43.408 --> 00:44:46.481
LIAM: We're gliding as we hash this out.

00:44:48.368 --> 00:44:51.228
TALIESIN: I mean, it's going to help a little, but--

00:44:51.228 --> 00:44:53.758
LAURA: Prayer of Healing just gives--

00:44:53.758 --> 00:44:55.061
TALIESIN: d8 plus five.

00:44:55.061 --> 00:44:55.894
LAURA: Okay.

00:44:56.792 --> 00:44:59.638
TRAVIS: DM, if we ever get within
range, where we might be able to--

00:44:59.638 --> 00:45:00.508
LAURA: And that's a what level?

00:45:00.508 --> 00:45:02.411
TRAVIS: -- discern a figure on the streets,

00:45:02.411 --> 00:45:03.598
TALIESIN: Second level is 2d8, plus--

00:45:03.598 --> 00:45:06.272
TRAVIS: I want to cast See Invisibility.
TALIESIN: -- it goes up for every level.

00:45:06.272 --> 00:45:07.944
LAURA: Maybe I'll do it at second at least.
MATT: You got it, okay.

00:45:07.944 --> 00:45:08.918
TALIESIN: I'll do it at four.
TRAVIS: I just don't know

00:45:08.918 --> 00:45:10.498
our distance to target.

00:45:10.498 --> 00:45:11.698
TALIESIN: Honestly, everyone's so beat up,

00:45:11.698 --> 00:45:14.058
it's not like we need-- the magic's going to matter anyway.

00:45:14.058 --> 00:45:16.365
LIAM: Are we doing a choo-choo train to float through the--

00:45:16.365 --> 00:45:20.896
TRAVIS: I like skydiving diamond, holding hands.

00:45:20.896 --> 00:45:22.388
MARISHA: Healing is not a waste.
TALIESIN: It's not everybody.

00:45:22.388 --> 00:45:24.299
MARISHA: Healing is never a waste.
LAURA: It's how many people?

00:45:25.954 --> 00:45:28.378
MATT: All traveling at the speed of the slowest member.

00:45:28.378 --> 00:45:31.618
LIAM: The slowest member, so not the sheep anymore at least.

00:45:31.618 --> 00:45:32.728
MATT: Well, the sheep was being carried.

00:45:32.728 --> 00:45:34.031
I would say at that point, not so much,

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.645
but unless you want to leave somebody behind.

00:45:35.645 --> 00:45:36.938
You can tether and tug,

00:45:36.938 --> 00:45:38.898
but it's still the speed of whoever that--

00:45:38.898 --> 00:45:39.988
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we never asked.

00:45:39.988 --> 00:45:41.018
We never got that answer.

00:45:41.018 --> 00:45:41.867
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:43.788
TALIESIN: 27.
TRAVIS: Tether and tug.

00:45:43.788 --> 00:45:46.828
LAURA: 27 healing to six people?
TALIESIN: My speed, no, no, no.

00:45:46.828 --> 00:45:48.738
We got to pick six people to heal.

00:45:48.738 --> 00:45:51.238
MARISHA: I'm at about half.
LAURA: Who's at the lowest?

00:45:51.238 --> 00:45:52.928
SAM: Yasha.
ASHLEY: I'm pretty bad.

00:45:52.928 --> 00:45:54.068
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're pretty bad.

00:45:54.068 --> 00:45:55.501
TRAVIS: I'll take it if nobody else's taking it.

00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:56.848
TALIESIN: Three, four,
MARISHA: I'm at half.

00:45:56.848 --> 00:45:58.888
TALIESIN: I could use one, so that's five.

00:45:58.888 --> 00:46:02.078
One, two, three, four, five, one more.

00:46:02.078 --> 00:46:03.578
LAURA: I'll take it if you're not down at all.

00:46:03.578 --> 00:46:04.861
Are you down?
SAM: I'm down a little.

00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:07.268
I mean, I'm at two-thirds.

00:46:07.268 --> 00:46:08.868
LAURA: I'm down, like, 60 points.

00:46:08.868 --> 00:46:09.951
TALIESIN: Okay, then.

00:46:11.718 --> 00:46:13.021
Well, yeah.

00:46:14.083 --> 00:46:15.333
MARISHA: Oof.

00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:16.592
TALIESIN: Eh, eh.

00:46:16.592 --> 00:46:19.175
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

00:46:19.175 --> 00:46:23.781
TALIESIN: 11, 16, 21 points.

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:26.396
MARISHA: Oh, that's pretty good, actually.

00:46:30.605 --> 00:46:32.674
LAURA and TRAVIS: Thank you, Caduceus.

00:46:32.674 --> 00:46:33.729
MARISHA: Thank you, Caduceus.

00:46:33.729 --> 00:46:35.276
LIAM: Thanks, Easter bunny. Bock bock!

00:46:35.276 --> 00:46:36.868
TALIESIN: A little better.

00:46:36.868 --> 00:46:40.498
ASHLEY: My current hit points went up when we rolled.

00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:43.628
So should I get rid of those, so I'm still at the same?

00:46:43.628 --> 00:46:45.028
TRAVIS: Nope.
LAURA: No, Matt said we could take--

00:46:45.028 --> 00:46:47.128
MATT: No, the hit point bump you can take,

00:46:47.128 --> 00:46:49.441
but any sort of spell slots

00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:50.951
and such would require a rest to regain.

00:46:50.951 --> 00:46:51.784
ASHLEY: Copy.

00:46:54.488 --> 00:46:56.048
LAURA: I mean, I could do a 5th-level.

00:46:56.048 --> 00:46:57.481
That's a Mass Cure Wounds.

00:47:01.625 --> 00:47:06.625
It's better to do the Prayer of Healing at a bump, though,

00:47:06.628 --> 00:47:07.461
isn't it?

00:47:07.461 --> 00:47:09.558
TALIESIN: Yeah, the 10 minutes gives you the d8s.

00:47:09.558 --> 00:47:11.998
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes more sense.

00:47:11.998 --> 00:47:13.218
TRAVIS: We might be there in 10 minutes

00:47:13.218 --> 00:47:15.048
if we can see people walking around.

00:47:15.048 --> 00:47:18.578
LAURA: I don't have Prayer of Healing
prepared, 'cause let's be honest.

00:47:18.578 --> 00:47:20.888
(laughter)

00:47:20.888 --> 00:47:24.478
TALIESIN: Sorry, that's a lot of laugh at.

00:47:24.478 --> 00:47:27.148
SAM: So because we're going as slow as the slowest member,

00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:29.888
should we split up so we can--

00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:31.716
MARISHA: Well, I can tether Caduceus.

00:47:31.716 --> 00:47:33.831
I'll help yank Caduceus along.

00:47:34.798 --> 00:47:38.688
MATT: Okay, I mean, you're pulling and it

00:47:38.688 --> 00:47:40.618
meets in the center of both of your speeds.

00:47:40.618 --> 00:47:42.068
So it does speed him up a bit,

00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:43.716
but it does slow you down.
MARISHA: It slows me down.

00:47:43.716 --> 00:47:45.991
LIAM: What if I took his other hand,

00:47:45.991 --> 00:47:48.291
since I'm the fastest here?
MARISHA: Oh, that's a good idea.

00:47:48.291 --> 00:47:50.332
That's a good idea.
TRAVIS: Do you have Expeditious?

00:47:50.332 --> 00:47:52.278
LIAM: No, not right now.
TRAVIS: I do.

00:47:52.278 --> 00:47:55.168
TALIESIN: I don't think it'll change
your intelligence modifier.

00:47:55.168 --> 00:47:58.448
TRAVIS: It'll double your speed though, right?

00:47:58.448 --> 00:47:59.429
LIAM: It's brain-powered here--

00:47:59.429 --> 00:48:01.580
TRAVIS: Oh.
LIAM: Thought-powered.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.292
MARISHA: Would it work-- yeah, that's a good point.

00:48:04.292 --> 00:48:06.358
TALIESIN: Not my strong suit.

00:48:06.358 --> 00:48:10.448
MARISHA: Okay, well, I'm not losing where I watched

00:48:10.448 --> 00:48:11.868
that person drop down.

00:48:11.868 --> 00:48:12.701
MATT: No worries.

00:48:14.438 --> 00:48:17.044
So yeah, the good news is the individuals

00:48:17.044 --> 00:48:19.248
that you're chasing here isn't speeding

00:48:19.248 --> 00:48:21.021
at an incredible speed beyond you,

00:48:22.618 --> 00:48:26.086
but you are slowed by the general speed of the group.

00:48:27.194 --> 00:48:29.258
TRAVIS: (coughs) Caduceus.

00:48:29.258 --> 00:48:30.888
MATT: As you begin to get closer to the city,

00:48:30.888 --> 00:48:33.891
you begin to feel a unique tug,

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:40.163
like gravity's beginning to kick in.

00:48:40.163 --> 00:48:41.562
SAM: Someone tugboating us?

00:48:41.562 --> 00:48:43.901
(laughter)

00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:47.238
MATT: Sure, whereas, the closer you get to the city,

00:48:47.238 --> 00:48:50.068
there is some sort of gravitational pull towards it,

00:48:50.068 --> 00:48:52.638
which doesn't adjust your movement.

00:48:52.638 --> 00:48:54.548
You still will yourself in the direction you're going,

00:48:54.548 --> 00:48:56.808
but you can feel that distinct pull.

00:48:56.808 --> 00:48:59.148
Whereas previously, it was just a free floating

00:48:59.148 --> 00:49:01.658
lack of gravity, which leads you to believe probably

00:49:01.658 --> 00:49:04.298
in proximity to this city,

00:49:04.298 --> 00:49:07.008
one could walk on the ground per normal--

00:49:07.008 --> 00:49:07.841
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:09.716
MATT: -- and utilize speed as such.
LAURA: All right.

00:49:09.716 --> 00:49:11.048
LIAM: But currently it doesn't feel like a fall.

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.508
It just feels like--

00:49:12.508 --> 00:49:13.341
LAURA: A tractor beam.

00:49:13.341 --> 00:49:15.048
MATT: Exactly.
LIAM: -- a tractor beam.

00:49:15.048 --> 00:49:18.098
MATT: You didn't realize the lack of gravity

00:49:18.098 --> 00:49:19.538
until you begin to feel gravity again,

00:49:19.538 --> 00:49:21.458
and you're like, right, that feels normal.

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.481
That was weird.

00:49:22.481 --> 00:49:23.314
LAURA: Okay.

00:49:25.528 --> 00:49:27.288
MATT: Eventually, you begin to crest up

00:49:27.288 --> 00:49:29.868
to that one little area,

00:49:29.868 --> 00:49:34.158
that one building rooftop where the figure vanished over,

00:49:34.158 --> 00:49:36.008
and, Fjord, as you drift and look,

00:49:36.008 --> 00:49:41.008
there is an intersection thoroughfare,

00:49:41.308 --> 00:49:44.925
a small square with a fountain

00:49:44.925 --> 00:49:49.878
and a little park and a domed tower with a unique kind

00:49:49.878 --> 00:49:52.928
of astral device on top of it, and homesteads

00:49:52.928 --> 00:49:55.978
and people that are out in the street talking to each other

00:49:55.978 --> 00:49:58.778
and moving and going about their business.

00:49:58.778 --> 00:50:02.828
TRAVIS: Because I can see these
people I'll cast See Invisibility

00:50:02.828 --> 00:50:04.748
for the next hour with the Star Razor.

00:50:04.748 --> 00:50:05.718
MATT: You've got it.

00:50:05.718 --> 00:50:06.798
LIAM: What is their dress like?

00:50:06.798 --> 00:50:09.718
Were they a variety of peoples?

00:50:09.718 --> 00:50:10.551
MATT: From what you can tell,

00:50:10.551 --> 00:50:15.198
they are a variety of peoples, mostly human,

00:50:15.198 --> 00:50:19.198
some elf, outfits that do resemble some of the outfits

00:50:19.198 --> 00:50:22.388
that you've found on various corpses

00:50:22.388 --> 00:50:23.838
throughout the ruins of Aeor.

00:50:24.728 --> 00:50:28.561
These appear to be Aeorian individuals.

00:50:29.888 --> 00:50:32.996
TRAVIS: Does anything else appear in the

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.863
spell--
MATT: Cast Invisibility?

00:50:34.863 --> 00:50:36.441
No.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:38.681
LIAM: And are we drawing any attention by being here?

00:50:39.528 --> 00:50:42.598
MATT: Nothing seems to be paying
attention to you at the moment.

00:50:42.598 --> 00:50:43.431
TALIESIN: Is there--
MATT: Not right now.

00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:46.648
You guys are just up in the air above a rooftop

00:50:46.648 --> 00:50:48.998
in the sky looking down over this intersection.

00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:51.291
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:52.124
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:53.708 --> 00:50:56.731
LIAM: And our quarry has already gone down.

00:50:57.678 --> 00:51:00.228
Well, we couldn't tell because they went over a lip, right?

00:51:00.228 --> 00:51:02.288
MATT: They went over a lip, and now you've caught up.

00:51:02.288 --> 00:51:04.088
You could attempt to see if they are anywhere

00:51:04.088 --> 00:51:05.881
within sight, if you want to make a perception check.

00:51:05.881 --> 00:51:07.698
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take that.
LIAM: Of course.

00:51:07.698 --> 00:51:09.258
MATT: Two individuals can go ahead and roll a perception.

00:51:09.258 --> 00:51:11.368
LIAM: I'm going.
LAURA: I'll give Guidance.

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:12.928
TALIESIN: I had rolled a natural 20 anyway.

00:51:12.928 --> 00:51:14.486
SAM and MARISHA: Ooh.

00:51:14.486 --> 00:51:15.828
TALIESIN: 30.
TRAVIS: Yeah, you did.

00:51:15.828 --> 00:51:17.168
MATT: 30, okay.

00:51:17.168 --> 00:51:18.396
TRAVIS: It's that new hair.

00:51:18.396 --> 00:51:19.848
LAURA: (laughs)

00:51:19.848 --> 00:51:21.168
TRAVIS: Babe.

00:51:21.168 --> 00:51:23.948
MATT: You give a confident glance around here

00:51:25.308 --> 00:51:27.638
and do not see an individual that resembles

00:51:27.638 --> 00:51:29.331
either Lucien or Cree.

00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:33.278
TALIESIN: And there's nothing weird
about the way people are moving

00:51:33.278 --> 00:51:34.111
or acting.

00:51:34.111 --> 00:51:36.909
There doesn't seem to be some sort of--

00:51:36.909 --> 00:51:38.248
MATT: The total of, what was it?

00:51:38.248 --> 00:51:39.999
TALIESIN: 30.
MATT: 30.

00:51:39.999 --> 00:51:41.408
LAURA: Plus Guidance, if you want to take it.

00:51:41.408 --> 00:51:42.966
TALIESIN: Oh, you know.

00:51:44.316 --> 00:51:45.199
34.

00:51:45.199 --> 00:51:47.949
(impressed exclamations)

00:51:51.378 --> 00:51:54.741
MATT: You're at a distance, so.
(laughter)

00:51:56.908 --> 00:51:57.741
TALIESIN: I'm looking for it.

00:51:57.741 --> 00:51:59.478
MATT: This is practically a zoom and enhance moment

00:51:59.478 --> 00:52:01.548
for you here, like (zooming).

00:52:01.548 --> 00:52:03.908
TALIESIN: Something must be wrong here and I know that.

00:52:03.908 --> 00:52:04.958
TRAVIS: Perfect steady cam.

00:52:06.578 --> 00:52:07.411
LIAM: Beau leans in front

00:52:07.411 --> 00:52:08.477
(spyglass opening sound).
MATT: You notice

00:52:08.477 --> 00:52:10.308
townsfolk are walking and they're stopping

00:52:10.308 --> 00:52:12.538
and facing each other and then going off in their own way,

00:52:12.538 --> 00:52:13.961
but there's no conversation.

00:52:17.458 --> 00:52:22.284
They're just almost going through the motions.

00:52:23.188 --> 00:52:25.218
TALIESIN: Are they acknowledge-- Oh,
we're too far away for me to--

00:52:25.218 --> 00:52:28.078
MATT: Too far away, but they're just,

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:29.828
some are picking up things and then moving,

00:52:29.828 --> 00:52:31.588
some look like they're interacting,

00:52:31.588 --> 00:52:33.038
but they're just looking at each other

00:52:33.038 --> 00:52:34.631
and then continue on their way.

00:52:36.625 --> 00:52:38.631
LIAM: They're like background extras.

00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:41.738
TRAVIS: Would you say we're 100
feet or farther away from them?

00:52:41.738 --> 00:52:43.538
MATT: Right now where you're standing, or, sorry,

00:52:43.538 --> 00:52:46.978
where you're hovering, you'd be about 90 to 100 feet away

00:52:46.978 --> 00:52:48.048
from the nearest person

00:52:48.048 --> 00:52:52.228
and about 150 feet from the middle of this main area

00:52:52.228 --> 00:52:54.228
where you saw the figure vanish towards.

00:52:55.448 --> 00:52:58.648
TALIESIN: Something is very not right.

00:52:58.648 --> 00:52:59.481
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:52:59.481 --> 00:53:02.228
TALIESIN: This is, I don't know.

00:53:02.228 --> 00:53:03.398
I need to get closer.

00:53:03.398 --> 00:53:06.239
LAURA: I wonder if all of their minds--
you know how when I tried to send a

00:53:06.239 --> 00:53:11.239
message to Yussa and all I got back was just that screaming?

00:53:11.648 --> 00:53:13.908
I bet that's what's in all of their brains.

00:53:13.908 --> 00:53:16.458
MARISHA: I mean, Caleb and I can now talk to people

00:53:17.818 --> 00:53:18.948
through our minds.

00:53:18.948 --> 00:53:22.678
So maybe they just have no need for their voice anymore.

00:53:22.678 --> 00:53:24.418
SAM: Oh, interesting.
TALIESIN: Or the other way around.

00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:26.666
They just don't need their bodies anymore.

00:53:26.666 --> 00:53:28.008
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: It's just--

00:53:28.008 --> 00:53:31.368
LIAM: They're not illusory, are
they, to Beau and Caleb's eyes?

00:53:31.368 --> 00:53:33.048
MATT: No, they're physical.

00:53:33.048 --> 00:53:33.988
LIAM: Okay.

00:53:33.988 --> 00:53:35.498
MARISHA: Yeah, that actually tracks.

00:53:35.498 --> 00:53:38.808
TALIESIN: This may just be going through the motions.

00:53:38.808 --> 00:53:41.228
MARISHA: The motions and their minds are elsewhere.

00:53:41.228 --> 00:53:42.818
TRAVIS: Caleb, I don't suppose you want to,

00:53:42.818 --> 00:53:44.378
with your speed--
TALIESIN: We need to get closer.

00:53:44.378 --> 00:53:47.278
TRAVIS: -- fly down and slap the socks of one of their heads

00:53:47.278 --> 00:53:48.741
and fly back up again?

00:53:50.562 --> 00:53:52.910
LIAM: Who knows how fast they might be.

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:55.088
TALIESIN: Or at least try and make eye contact.

00:53:55.088 --> 00:53:56.388
TRAVIS: Or slap their heads.

00:53:56.388 --> 00:53:58.488
MARISHA: You said there was a device

00:53:58.488 --> 00:54:00.101
in the center of this courtyard?

00:54:01.518 --> 00:54:02.351
Like a--

00:54:02.351 --> 00:54:04.458
MATT: So you see there are a number of buildings,

00:54:05.648 --> 00:54:06.678
kind of surrounding it.

00:54:06.678 --> 00:54:10.368
There is a raised area with a fountain in the middle.

00:54:10.368 --> 00:54:12.578
Though, you would also note there is no water

00:54:12.578 --> 00:54:13.411
in the fountain.

00:54:14.638 --> 00:54:15.928
TALIESIN: There is no water in the fountain.

00:54:15.928 --> 00:54:16.956
TRAVIS: My god.

00:54:16.956 --> 00:54:20.797
(laughter)
MARISHA: What is this place?

00:54:20.797 --> 00:54:23.608
SAM: It's the best fountain I've ever seen.

00:54:23.608 --> 00:54:24.908
TRAVIS: It's all wrong.

00:54:24.908 --> 00:54:27.032
It's all gone wrong.

00:54:27.032 --> 00:54:28.598
(slap) Get a hold of yourself.

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:29.631
LIAM: You maniacs.

00:54:30.748 --> 00:54:33.118
TRAVIS and SAM: What have you done?

00:54:33.118 --> 00:54:37.328
MATT: There are a number of connected residential buildings.

00:54:37.328 --> 00:54:42.211
There is a beautiful dome structure with a

00:54:45.578 --> 00:54:47.470
metallic weather vane type device on top.

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:51.548
There's a tree and a little garden,

00:54:51.548 --> 00:54:53.698
almost like a courtyard garden area.

00:54:53.698 --> 00:54:54.598
TALIESIN: A healthy tree?

00:54:54.598 --> 00:54:55.638
LAURA: Yeah, is the tree alive

00:54:55.638 --> 00:54:57.458
or is it one of those rotten trees?

00:54:57.458 --> 00:54:59.756
MATT: It's vibrant and green.

00:54:59.756 --> 00:55:03.558
TALIESIN: Are there any buildings
with roof access that we can see

00:55:03.558 --> 00:55:07.708
with a door going down or anything like that?

00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:10.658
Like a way to get inside a building from the roof?

00:55:10.658 --> 00:55:14.998
MATT: No, a lot of the roofs are textured and smooth and

00:55:14.998 --> 00:55:18.148
either like tower tops or just a shingled roof,

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:21.198
but you do not see any signs of fireplaces

00:55:22.758 --> 00:55:23.948
or any chimneys, at least.

00:55:23.948 --> 00:55:27.038
You do not see any sort of hatches or openings that way.

00:55:27.038 --> 00:55:29.198
TALIESIN: Any second floor or third floor windows

00:55:29.198 --> 00:55:32.568
that we could maybe Peter Pan our way into?

00:55:32.568 --> 00:55:34.798
MATT: There are some windows, yeah.

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:36.448
TALIESIN: I think we need cover

00:55:36.448 --> 00:55:40.828
and I think we need to not fly down to the ground.

00:55:40.828 --> 00:55:44.118
TRAVIS: Aren't we worried about losing who we're chasing?

00:55:44.118 --> 00:55:45.808
TALIESIN: We've lost who we're chasing.

00:55:45.808 --> 00:55:47.838
We need to find out where they were going now.

00:55:47.838 --> 00:55:51.641
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try Divine Intervention to--

00:55:51.641 --> 00:55:53.752
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I thought they went into the ground.

00:55:53.752 --> 00:55:55.147
MARISHA: Yeah, you said they went

00:55:55.147 --> 00:55:56.848
towards the center courtyard area, right?

00:55:56.848 --> 00:56:00.158
MATT: You saw them vanish over the edge

00:56:00.158 --> 00:56:02.750
in the direction of this general intersection,

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:05.508
and by the time you've caught up, they're not present.

00:56:05.508 --> 00:56:06.660
LIAM: Yeah, they just did this, right?

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.938
(vanishing whoosh)
MATT: Exactly.

00:56:07.938 --> 00:56:10.008
TRAVIS: And then we came over the top and it's Time Square.

00:56:10.008 --> 00:56:10.841
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Got it.

00:56:10.841 --> 00:56:11.674
LIAM: Yeah, they could have

00:56:11.674 --> 00:56:13.840
switched back around the building.
MATT: Now, it's not super dense here.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.618
There are anywhere from like eight to 10 people

00:56:16.618 --> 00:56:19.925
in this courtyard just going about their business.

00:56:19.925 --> 00:56:20.800
SAM: Kill them all.

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:23.481
The one who screams is our person.

00:56:25.188 --> 00:56:30.188
TALIESIN: I think going inside and
just having a moment to walk down

00:56:30.358 --> 00:56:33.022
into this might be a smarter idea than flying into--

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:34.658
TRAVIS: It's only eight to 10.

00:56:34.658 --> 00:56:37.028
Should we experiment with one of these people?

00:56:37.028 --> 00:56:40.738
See if they even have eyes, look at us, anything?

00:56:40.738 --> 00:56:42.146
TALIESIN: They might sound the alarm.
LAURA: You can try sending a Message

00:56:42.146 --> 00:56:44.258
to one of them and see if they can respond.

00:56:44.258 --> 00:56:45.448
SAM: Very smart.

00:56:45.448 --> 00:56:46.561
All right, sure.

00:56:47.408 --> 00:56:51.091
I'll pick someone who's walking away from us.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.650
And I guess fly close enough to be within 120 feet.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.062
MATT: Okay, easy enough to do.

00:56:58.062 --> 00:57:02.171
SAM: And take out a wire and cast Message and say:

00:57:07.552 --> 00:57:08.485
Hey.

00:57:09.741 --> 00:57:10.656
LAURA: (laughs)

00:57:10.656 --> 00:57:13.553
It's not that easy, is it?
SAM: No, it's not.

00:57:13.553 --> 00:57:15.540
I need someone counting me.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:16.955
ASHLEY: I'll count.
TALIESIN: Five.

00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:21.570
SAM: Hey there, you, nice day out today, isn't it?

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:23.136
So nice, you should

00:57:23.136 --> 00:57:26.852
look up in the sky and see more.

00:57:26.852 --> 00:57:28.347
TALIESIN: Wow, you're-- yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:57:28.347 --> 00:57:29.977
SAM: You can reply to this message.

00:57:31.693 --> 00:57:33.220
ASHLEY: Sounds about right.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.420
MATT: You do not get any response, but the individual

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:36.460
that you're targeting, which looks

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:40.808
to be maybe a 17-year old girl, jet black hair

00:57:40.808 --> 00:57:44.620
in a light lavender day outfit

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.650
with really nice, long, wide-robed sleeves,

00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:50.443
walking along just stops.

00:57:52.921 --> 00:57:53.754
SAM: Ooh.

00:57:53.754 --> 00:57:55.045
MATT: And looks up

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.440
and then continues walking.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.330
SAM: Okay, okay, they understand language.

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:04.163
TRAVIS: Interesting.

00:58:04.163 --> 00:58:05.970
LAURA: They're susceptible to--
SAM: They're alive.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.880
To stimulus?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.180
TALIESIN: That's an assumption.

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.450
ASHLEY: She didn't do anything.

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:12.972
LIAM: I feel like anything we do right now--
LAURA: She looked up.

00:58:12.972 --> 00:58:15.877
LIAM: --is poking the badger.
ASHLEY: They didn't try to-- hostile.

00:58:15.877 --> 00:58:17.260
SAM: They're not in fear.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.300
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:21.650
SAM: Yeah, so maybe we can go down and get closer.

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:25.413
LIAM: I get a bead on another person and think:

00:58:26.317 --> 00:58:28.097
Excuse me, do you have the time?

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.020
MATT: The individual stops

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.791
and looks up at you.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:45.329
(screams) And just screams fully loud--

00:58:45.329 --> 00:58:46.240
LIAM: Wow.
MATT: -- towards you.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.720
This endless, echoing, terrifying, volumetric screech.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.535
ASHLEY: That is so scary.
MATT: That just goes

00:58:52.535 --> 00:58:54.730
and goes and goes.

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:56.620
Nobody else is paying attention at the moment

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.920
and then suddenly it stops

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.280
and you feel this buzzing in your head

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:07.310
and a voice in the middle of just your mind

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:11.811
that goes, "Ha, I see you, come, come.

00:59:12.769 --> 00:59:14.027
"We must talk."

00:59:15.527 --> 00:59:17.722
LIAM: What do you want to talk about?

00:59:20.314 --> 00:59:25.024
MATT: "Many things, but quickly, before the others know."

00:59:25.902 --> 00:59:27.833
And the figure, still staring at you,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.920
walks over into one of the side, not an alleyway,

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.633
but one of the streets and stands next to this archway.

00:59:39.239 --> 00:59:40.361
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:59:40.361 --> 00:59:41.530
I don't like any of it.

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.130
TALIESIN: That was about one of the most unsettling

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:45.106
things I've ever seen in my life.
LIAM: I thought Matt was going to open

00:59:45.106 --> 00:59:47.624
his jaw and just keep going and going.

00:59:47.624 --> 00:59:49.574
TALIESIN: And another Matt was going to be inside.

00:59:49.574 --> 00:59:50.581
(laughter)

00:59:50.581 --> 00:59:52.646
ASHLEY: What's weird is I wouldn't have been surprised

00:59:52.646 --> 00:59:55.012
with everything else that he does.

00:59:55.012 --> 00:59:56.501
It's like how does he do that?

00:59:56.501 --> 00:59:59.315
TRAVIS: I was going to attack it with fire.

00:59:59.315 --> 01:00:00.148
SAM: Caleb,

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:03.860
you're making friends, this is good for you.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.420
TRAVIS: Jesus.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.740
LIAM: You guys didn't hear anything either.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.714
You just saw me looking at a person.

01:00:08.714 --> 01:00:09.789
SAM: It seemed like a nice scream.

01:00:09.789 --> 01:00:11.890
MATT: You all heard the scream.
LIAM: The scream, yes.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.837
But I didn't say anything.

01:00:13.837 --> 01:00:14.870
LAURA: What happened?

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.247
TALIESIN: Did he tell you the time?

01:00:16.247 --> 01:00:19.450
LIAM: I reached out and they reached back

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.437
and invited me down to talk.

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:25.887
TRAVIS: Do you want to talk?

01:00:27.395 --> 01:00:29.710
LIAM: I don't know what else to do right now.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:30.760
SAM: Yeah.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.090
TALIESIN: I think we should.

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.070
SAM: We've got your back.

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:35.300
LAURA: Ask him where the threshold crests go.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.412
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

01:00:36.412 --> 01:00:38.190
SAM: Well.
LAURA: Well.

01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:40.060
TALIESIN: Let's go down together.
TRAVIS: When it looked up at you,

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.140
could you see eyes, like normal--

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.780
LIAM: It just looked--
TRAVIS: -- iris pupil?

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.390
LIAM: -- humanoid, right?

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.930
MATT: At the distance you're at, it looked humanoid, yeah.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:50.750
LIAM: Okay, well, don't come all the way

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.940
with me, but don't be too far behind.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.550
TALIESIN: We'll be on the roof, maybe.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.340
LIAM: Okay, seems like a good idea.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.440
ASHLEY: No, I think this is a terrible idea.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.690
TRAVIS: Within 60 feet.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:03.990
TRAVIS: 60 feet above them is fine.

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:07.252
LIAM: Okay, I will, with my

01:01:07.252 --> 01:01:10.500
at Intelligence 20, 60 feet in a round kind of speed,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.190
I will, for once, zap down.

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:16.413
MATT: Yeah, you travel faster than anybody in this troop.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:19.060
You have a speed of 60

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.677
while gliding around, just (whoosh).

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:23.723
Okay.

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:24.930
TRAVIS: I'll trail him just as a guard

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:27.320
and once I'm within 60 feet of those people,

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.650
just Divine Sense just to cover it.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:31.483
MATT: Okay.

01:01:31.483 --> 01:01:35.110
So of the square, there's this little archway

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:37.160
where the individual is standing against.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.960
You (whoosh) glide down to it.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.130
The rest of you are staying near the rooftops?

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:43.280
What are you doing?
TRAVIS: I'm staying closer.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.035
60 feet above the population.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.060
MATT: Above the population?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:46.893
MATT: Over the main thing?

01:01:46.893 --> 01:01:47.951
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Okay. So you're above

01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:49.012
in the center of the--

01:01:49.012 --> 01:01:51.910
TRAVIS: Sword out, the whole thing.
Not trying to hide anything.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:52.870
MATT: You've got it, okay.

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:56.180
SAM: Is that weather vane thing close to us?

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.420
MATT: It's across the way from where

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.240
Caleb's quarry currently is.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.290
About 60 or 70 feet across

01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:05.150
the other side of where the fountain is.

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:08.141
SAM: Great, me and Beau will go over and check that out.

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:08.974
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm going to

01:02:08.974 --> 01:02:10.190
head towards where Caleb's going,

01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:13.398
but I'm also going to do the 60-foot thing and just do a

01:02:13.398 --> 01:02:17.980
Eyes of the Grave on a couple people.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:21.890
ASHLEY: Yeah, I want to stay close
to Caleb, so the same area.

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.390
LAURA: Sam, same.

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:24.610
SAM: Sam?
MATT: Okay.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:25.820
LAURA: Sam.
LIAM: Sammy.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.750
MATT: So we have Beau and Veth are making their way

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:32.683
towards the domed tower--
MARISHA: ♪ (tune of "A Thousand Miles") ♪

01:02:32.683 --> 01:02:35.791
MATT: -- on the other side. Everyone else
is staying near Caleb,

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:39.945
or Fjord is right over the
middle of the whole intersection. Got it.

01:02:39.945 --> 01:02:40.990
LAURA: I'm going to be right above

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.250
the arch where the person went.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:43.083
MATT: Okay.

01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:44.600
So Caleb, as you dart down,

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.700
it's this arch that goes over the middle

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.337
of the roadway and you drift and the individual

01:02:50.337 --> 01:02:52.740
is just standing there, arms to the side.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.620
Getting a closer look now,

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.873
you can see it's a man in his 40s,

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.050
looks like he hasn't shaved in a few days.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:03.450
A little salt and pepper hair on the sides.

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:07.290
Hair is combed back and a little bit to the left.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:08.908
Back and to the left.

01:03:08.908 --> 01:03:11.610
ASHLEY: Back, to the left.

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:15.580
MATT: Dressed in nice clothing, though of a unique design

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:20.430
that you've only seen in other places of the Aeor ruin.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.970
Something out of the corner of your eye

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.560
twitches and you glance over and the base

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.913
of the stone archway,

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.420
the stone seems to gradually turn

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.300
a reddish tint and towards the base of it,

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:42.260
it seems to almost fan out like a skin

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.420
where it meets the ground.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.488
You can see this smoother, fleshy texture.

01:03:47.488 --> 01:03:48.371
SAM: Fleshy.

01:03:48.371 --> 01:03:51.580
MATT: Where veins seem to almost undulate

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.180
and bulge beneath the surface and you can see a couple

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:59.067
of errant teeth just poking out in place.

01:03:59.067 --> 01:04:01.340
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out, dude.
MATT: And it just

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.252
becomes the archway and is stone.

01:04:04.252 --> 01:04:05.735
TRAVIS: Damn this place.

01:04:05.735 --> 01:04:06.568
ASHLEY: I hate it.

01:04:06.568 --> 01:04:07.710
TRAVIS: I want out.
LAURA: I'm not a fan.

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.449
Not a fan of this place.

01:04:09.449 --> 01:04:11.060
TRAVIS: Let's go. Let's get out of here.
MARISHA: Teeth and flesh.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.707
Teeth and flesh.
TRAVIS: Survival of the--

01:04:12.707 --> 01:04:13.598
LAURA: (groans)

01:04:13.598 --> 01:04:16.020
MATT: How close do you get to this individual?

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.378
SAM: Close enough to tugboat.

01:04:17.378 --> 01:04:18.411
(laughter)

01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:20.561
LIAM: Yeah, six-inch range.

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:23.590
MARISHA: Oh my god.
LIAM: Let's say 10 feet for now.

01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:25.220
MATT: 10 feet?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.510
MATT: You drift down before them.

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:27.997
TRAVIS: In the butt cheeks.
MATT: And they look up

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:31.243
and you can see the face is just blank before it goes.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.573
SAM: Oh god.

01:04:33.573 --> 01:04:36.090
MATT: And just starts sobbing, before the sobbing stops,

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:38.180
their head twitches a bit to one side

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.874
and one eye turns red and swells.

01:04:41.874 --> 01:04:42.707
(slurps)

01:04:42.707 --> 01:04:45.930
Their head seems to just balloon up

01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:49.943
as this massive red eye is now peering towards you.

01:04:49.943 --> 01:04:51.297
SAM: Please don't pop.
MATT: With a (impact sound)

01:04:51.297 --> 01:04:54.082
and you feel your brain begin to get that fuzz a bit.

01:04:54.082 --> 01:04:58.130
ASHLEY: I want to get closer to be in Caleb's range.

01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:59.290
MATT: Okay.

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:01.733
LIAM: If I'm able, I'll pull back
another five feet, if not--

01:05:01.733 --> 01:05:05.300
MATT: You come back about five
feet and you recognize this eye.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.370
It's been in a dream or two before

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:13.143
or at least something like this and it says,

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:21.900
"You know the terror of the end, mortal ones.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.685
"The nothing, the acceptance of fate or even oblivion.

01:05:25.685 --> 01:05:27.109
"We-- <i>We</i>

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:29.327
"cannot end.

01:05:29.327 --> 01:05:33.160
"No, at all costs, oblivion must be destroyed.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.060
"We will endure."

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:37.700
You're hearing this in your mind.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.784
Everyone else, you're just watching
them stare at each other.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.853
Beauregard, you are catching the faint conversation.

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.520
TRAVIS: Eyes of the Grave, Divine Sense,

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.190
anything trigger within 60 feet?

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:50.240
Nothing?
MATT: Nothing.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.350
But the closer you get,

01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:54.253
you begin to hear the conversation in your minds, too.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.940
LAURA: I'm like right above it.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.497
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Ugh.

01:05:58.497 --> 01:06:02.480
MATT: "Driven by fear, you are powerful.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.313
"Yes.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:08.710
"The need to survive, yes, yes, we can protect one another.

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:14.170
"I am Timorei, one of the Somnovem."

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:17.200
SAM: Oh.
MATT: "And I beseech to you,

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.200
I need your aid, your aid, aid, aid, aid."

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.657
LIAM: Explain.

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:28.673
MATT: "Elatis and Luctus pathed

01:06:28.673 --> 01:06:31.220
"to end our march, to bring darkness

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.210
"and nothing to all that we have made.

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:38.120
"They embrace-ace-ace the unknown.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.580
"Their reasons are madness.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.805
"They must be stopped.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:44.746
"If you would find them,

01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:48.483
"find them within the Aether Crux.

01:06:49.657 --> 01:06:51.190
"End them

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.745
"so that we others

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.176
"may survive.

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.646
"Please!"

01:07:03.716 --> 01:07:06.887
LIAM: You are not all one?

01:07:06.887 --> 01:07:09.554
MATT: "The others around here, they cannot hear me.

01:07:10.713 --> 01:07:12.879
"Just you."

01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:16.481
LIAM: And if we were to help you,

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.629
how would we?

01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:23.794
MATT: "Find the Aether Crux.

01:07:24.675 --> 01:07:28.962
"Find Elatis and Luctus

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:31.504
"where their essence resides

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.622
"and end them."

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:40.240
SAM: Oh god.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.934
LAURA: Can I insight check to see if it feels like a trap?

01:07:43.934 --> 01:07:45.840
MATT: Sure.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.580
MARISHA: Is there Insight in the madness?

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.197
LAURA: Yeah, right?

01:07:49.197 --> 01:07:51.211
SAM: We walked into WandaVision.

01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:54.131
LAURA: No, I can't be here.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:55.320
LAURA: N-n-nine.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.723
Maybe a nine is extra special here.

01:07:57.723 --> 01:07:59.356
MATT: It's not even trying to read--

01:07:59.356 --> 01:08:00.189
TRAVIS: Uh, no.

01:08:00.189 --> 01:08:01.580
(laughter)

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.440
MATT: -- the vocal pattern because there's no voice,

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.144
these are just thoughts and emotions and just

01:08:07.144 --> 01:08:10.540
a shotgun of fear

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.420
and communication

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.460
through a veil of scattered

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:20.280
insanity and madness.

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.113
It is

01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:26.383
impossible to make out any intent behind it,

01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:31.710
beyond just what's being said, but what you do take from it,

01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:32.570
all of you do

01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:37.860
is a profound sense of terror.

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:41.819
Not yours, though you may have your own in this instance

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:46.270
but terror from this entity,

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:48.598
this Timorei.

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:53.046
TRAVIS: And the names he said were Elactus and Luctus?

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.625
MATT: Elatis and Luctus.

01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:56.782
LIAM: Elatis and Luctus.

01:08:56.782 --> 01:08:59.389
MARISHA: Elatis

01:08:59.389 --> 01:09:01.156
and Luctus.

01:09:01.156 --> 01:09:02.690
LAURA: Luctus.

01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:04.080
TRAVIS: I wrote it three times trying to remember

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.020
what you said because the sounds were so similar.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.960
MARISHA: And the Aether Crux?
LIAM: Aether Crux.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.070
And what did this individual say that,

01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:15.030
I don't know if it's talking about itself,

01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:18.020
but it said a name beginning with a T?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.280
MATT: Timorei.
LIAM: Timorei.

01:09:20.731 --> 01:09:22.460
MARISHA: And he said he's one of the Somnovem?

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.293
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:27.162
SAM: And we met one just walking around the park or no?

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.300
They're part of a hivemind?
LAURA: No, they're a hivemind.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.430
MARISHA: Yeah, and he said but the others aren't here?

01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:34.420
TRAVIS: It also doesn't mean he's telling the truth.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.470
LIAM: Right.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.435
MARISHA: Or he's going rogue against the other Somnovem.

01:09:37.435 --> 01:09:38.540
LAURA: Yeah, that could be what it is.

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.831
MARISHA: I think that's what's happening.

01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:42.456
LIAM: Or there's--

01:09:42.456 --> 01:09:44.239
MATT: "Where is he?"

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.690
The eye looks around and there's no expression,

01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:52.220
it's just this giant swollen fearful face and this

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.033
gargantuan red eye that is just burning towards you.

01:09:56.944 --> 01:10:01.207
"Where is he? Where is the Nonagon?"

01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:05.241
SAM: What?
MATT: "His second walks,

01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:07.920
"but he is beyond our sight.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.010
"He was to come, but we can't see him.

01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:14.647
"Maybe he'll help, help."

01:10:14.647 --> 01:10:17.527
LIAM: What'll he do when he arrives?

01:10:17.527 --> 01:10:19.843
MATT: "He's going to help us through.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.356
"Help us home. Welcome us home."

01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:27.856
LIAM: How many of there are you?

01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:30.031
MATT: "We are

01:10:30.953 --> 01:10:34.608
"nine and another nine and within us

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.595
"many."

01:10:36.595 --> 01:10:38.650
And as you hear "many," everyone

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:42.548
in the street around you at once says, "many" in unison.

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.700
TRAVIS: Ooh (chuckles).

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.160
No.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.020
SAM: Maybe they just need us to help them.

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:52.420
TRAVIS: I cast Meteor Swarm.
LAURA: They want to come through?

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.900
SAM: Yeah, so they can be better again.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.280
TRAVIS: I don't have it, but I'm just--

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.857
TALIESIN: Go to sleep.

01:10:56.857 --> 01:10:59.433
LIAM: This place is strange to us.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.977
What do we need to be wary of?

01:11:06.866 --> 01:11:08.841
MATT: "The rest.

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:13.916
"I must go.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.540
"I can sense them coming.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.033
"They are curious, too.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.447
(terrified) "They're curious, too."

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.890
And the eye (whoosh) reverts

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:26.849
and the person just liquefies into the ground.

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:27.682
(sloshing)

01:11:27.682 --> 01:11:30.065
(screaming)

01:11:30.065 --> 01:11:31.718
And where they were,

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:34.210
cobblestone.

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:36.510
TRAVIS: Shut the f--
LAURA: These people aren't real.

01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:37.860
At least the people aren't real.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.899
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Get out of there, Caleb.

01:11:38.899 --> 01:11:41.410
LIAM: This is like bio-organic dream material and the

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:44.700
consciousness can slide around to anywhere it wants to go.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.020
TALIESIN: I don't like any of this.
MARISHA: And he said there's nine

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:50.503
and then nine within and then nine within, it is a fractal.

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:54.230
This whole city is a fractal.

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:56.610
TRAVIS: I go down the 60 feet. I land on the cobblestone.

01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:59.083
I don't approach Caleb, but I just feet down.

01:12:00.203 --> 01:12:01.766
LAURA: You touch-- you're touching the city?

01:12:01.766 --> 01:12:02.599
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: (impact sound)

01:12:02.599 --> 01:12:04.672
MATT: You can feel the gravity. It walks normally.

01:12:04.672 --> 01:12:06.000
TRAVIS: I take the tip of the sword and I just

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.823
poke the cobblestone. Make a sound like stone?

01:12:08.823 --> 01:12:10.757
MATT: Yep. (clink, clink)

01:12:12.442 --> 01:12:14.620
LIAM: And there are still others walking about?

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.690
MATT: There's somebody else now who's turned towards you.

01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:19.180
You can see this older woman,

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.465
her gray and white hair is

01:12:23.514 --> 01:12:27.881
braided up into this top-backed beautiful bow-like bun

01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:32.620
and she's wearing these deep green and turquoise robes.

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.120
She's carrying a small bag,

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.100
looks like it's containing some fruit

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:41.008
and she looks over towards you and takes a step.

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:43.070
TRAVIS: I take a step back.

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:45.110
MATT: And you all begin to notice,
the people that are walking,

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:48.426
as they walk and you get a look,

01:12:48.426 --> 01:12:51.870
the clothing, the sleeves,

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:55.610
there's no sleeve that goes over an arm.

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:58.680
The sleeve becomes a hand.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.910
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MATT: The robe becomes a neck.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:04.100
MARISHA: Like a Barbie or like a doll?

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:08.518
MATT: Meaning it's all one thing.

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:09.351
MARISHA: Like when you have a doll

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:10.409
and you're like--
SAM: It's painted on.

01:13:10.409 --> 01:13:12.375
MARISHA: Yeah and there's not really sleeves.

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:17.180
MATT: With each step, a portion of the ground reaches up

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.870
for the foot and something from the foot reaches out

01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:21.172
and tethers and pulls it down.

01:13:21.172 --> 01:13:23.072
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
LAURA: Ugh.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:28.233
MATT: This old woman never fully leaves contact.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:30.993
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: And as she approaches,

01:13:32.381 --> 01:13:35.070
(growls) her throat bubbles outward and the mouth

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:38.054
opens wide and a giant red eye (whoosh)--

01:13:38.054 --> 01:13:40.012
LAURA: Fuck.
MATT: -- appears,

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:43.678
and a voice goes

01:13:43.678 --> 01:13:45.698
(guttural) "Who?

01:13:45.698 --> 01:13:47.560
"Who was here?"

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:48.900
In your mind.

01:13:51.407 --> 01:13:53.943
TRAVIS: "Who was here?"

01:13:54.962 --> 01:13:58.110
We don't know, we followed someone here.

01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:00.290
MATT: (snarls)

01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:03.660
You all can begin to hear this growl

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.196
come through in your various minds.

01:14:08.639 --> 01:14:09.980
(growls)

01:14:11.202 --> 01:14:13.881
"I can sense

01:14:13.881 --> 01:14:15.031
"the brethren.

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:18.950
"Welcome."

01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:23.504
TRAVIS: Thank you?

01:14:23.504 --> 01:14:25.587
MARISHA and LAURA: (laugh)

01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:31.140
MATT: "I am Ira."

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:33.260
SAM: Ira?
ASHLEY: Imira?

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.580
MATT: Ira.
ASHLEY: Ira.

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.964
I apologize.

01:14:35.964 --> 01:14:38.120
MATT: (chuckles)

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.030
TRAVIS: Roth Ira.

01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:42.150
(laughter)

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:45.100
SAM: Brother of Sep.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:45.933
TALIESIN: Every name.

01:14:45.933 --> 01:14:47.798
There's no name that you can make that we can't break.

01:14:47.798 --> 01:14:49.465
MATT: I know,

01:14:49.465 --> 01:14:51.780
and there's no way that I can't make you pay for it.

01:14:54.314 --> 01:14:59.314
"You march here with vengeance

01:14:59.572 --> 01:15:02.050
"in your souls.

01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:02.958
"Yes.

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:07.330
"Inferno in your bellies

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:13.170
"pushed by pain and the need to make it--

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:14.090
"(snarls)

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:17.418
"make the planes bleed

01:15:17.418 --> 01:15:19.733
"as you have suffered

01:15:19.733 --> 01:15:22.138
"for their lack of respect.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.970
"They all shall feel our wrath.

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:32.565
"Creation is born from destruction

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:38.080
"and if all that is worthy of us is destroyed,

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.605
"then so much more can be created

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.550
"or forgotten.

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:48.240
"Fates that threw us to torment and death,

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.256
"they all will pay.

01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:55.661
"Who

01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:59.417
"were you talking to?"

01:16:03.037 --> 01:16:07.340
LIAM: We are new here. It is hard to get our bearings.

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.597
I'm not sure.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.943
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:16:16.012 --> 01:16:18.145
SAM: You're going to get somebody in trouble.

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:23.340
MATT: With disadvantage because you are marked

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.713
by them.

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:28.540
LIAM: 14.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:29.373
MATT: 14.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.000
The eye that's looking at you (whooshes)

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.665
shifts over towards you

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:42.380
and the grandma's legs seem to break

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.720
and fold on them as her body begins to fall forward

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.997
and then slithers across the stone around you

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:55.220
towards Caleb before righting itself,

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.530
the mouth still wide and swollen, the eye peering at you.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.030
LIAM: This time I don't back up.

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:03.326
MATT: "You

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.040
"lie."

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.420
And every other civilian around

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.683
at once goes, "Lie" in unison.

01:17:14.727 --> 01:17:16.637
LIAM: It had the ring of truth, though.

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:24.367
How do you feel about visitors in this, your fine city?

01:17:26.293 --> 01:17:28.876
MATT: (low snarling)

01:17:35.704 --> 01:17:37.462
"Was it Mirumus?"

01:17:38.703 --> 01:17:40.386
MARISHA: Mirumus?

01:17:40.386 --> 01:17:42.311
MATT: "Was it Gaudius?

01:17:43.941 --> 01:17:46.149
"Tell me."

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.170
The eye burns brighter and redder

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:52.518
and you can feel this white-hot pain

01:17:52.518 --> 01:17:55.043
in the back of your mind that begins to burgeon.

01:17:57.667 --> 01:18:01.241
LIAM: Yeah, it was Gaudius.

01:18:02.943 --> 01:18:04.882
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:18:04.882 --> 01:18:07.463
LIAM: At disadvantage?
MATT: At disadvantage, yeah.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.054
LIAM: 21.

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:11.987
MATT: 21.

01:18:13.752 --> 01:18:16.668
(snarls)

01:18:16.668 --> 01:18:18.017
"Gaudius,

01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:22.700
"do not trust them.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:24.380
"They push forward without call

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:28.972
"for truth in the evils of existence (snarls).

01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:33.487
"They wash us all towards oblivion

01:18:33.487 --> 01:18:36.396
"with arms open and naive.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.570
"To strike first is to survive

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:46.070
"and to punish before you yourself can be hurt.

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:51.585
"All will eventually hurt you.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.172
"Find their essences and destroy.

01:18:57.759 --> 01:19:01.793
"Then maybe we can talk.

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:08.323
"Show me that you can do

01:19:08.323 --> 01:19:12.381
"what I need you to do!

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.114
"(growls)"

01:19:14.114 --> 01:19:18.850
The mouth seems to distend and break as the eye pops

01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:21.700
into red ether energy.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.810
The now swollen and pulled back

01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:27.710
woman's head seems to snap backwards.

01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:32.600
Her body begins to shake and quiver as with about six

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.780
of the other civilians around you begin to just (crackling).

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:39.270
Before (gurgles) their flesh all

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:42.340
simultaneously tears open in a whirlwind of teeth

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.711
and eyes and muscle and tethering tentacles.

01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:47.961
(snarling)

01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.710
I need you all to roll initiative.

01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:53.702
(cheering)

01:19:53.702 --> 01:19:56.140
TRAVIS: We're fighting in space!

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.780
ASHLEY: Matt, you're so good!

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.921
MARISHA: So wait, Ira?
LAURA: I don't like Ira.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:02.984
TRAVIS: Timorei, Ira.

01:20:02.984 --> 01:20:04.468
Mirumus, Gaudius.

01:20:04.468 --> 01:20:05.993
MARISHA: Gaudius.
TRAVIS: Elatis.

01:20:05.993 --> 01:20:07.259
SAM: This creepy combat--
ASHLEY: What a cool map!

01:20:07.259 --> 01:20:08.092
TRAVIS: Gaudius.

01:20:08.092 --> 01:20:09.413
MATT: G-A-U-D-I-U-S.
SAM: -- was brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:11.055
LIAM: Who I just threw under the bus.
SAM: Makers of premium

01:20:11.055 --> 01:20:13.821
handcrafted gaming terrain.
LAURA: Gaudius, Mirumus, Ira, Timorei.

01:20:13.821 --> 01:20:15.058
ASHLEY: Mirumus, Gaudius.

01:20:15.058 --> 01:20:16.174
LIAM: Elatis and Luctus.
SAM: If you'd like to become

01:20:16.174 --> 01:20:18.510
a master of battle maps like Matt Mercer--
LAURA: There's so many.

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:19.976
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:20:19.976 --> 01:20:21.809
SAM: -- cut your teeth on Dwarven Forge's starter sets.

01:20:21.809 --> 01:20:22.642
ASHLEY: Name them again.

01:20:22.642 --> 01:20:27.642
LAURA: Gaudius, Mirumus, Ira, Timorei, Elatis, Luctus.

01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:30.740
SAM: Check it all out at bit.ly/CritRoleDF.

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.563
MATT: You had come down here near

01:20:32.563 --> 01:20:33.860
the fountain you said, in the center?

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.180
TRAVIS: Sure.
LIAM: I'm Ira Glass.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.180
Welcome back to This Aeorian Life.
MARISHA: I know, that's what I think of--

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:41.123
TRAVIS: Within a movement's distance of Caleb.

01:20:41.123 --> 01:20:43.208
MATT: Yes, Caleb.
ASHLEY: This is Ira Glass.

01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:45.430
LIAM: Love that dude.
MARISHA: Yeah (laughs).

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:47.480
MATT: Caleb, you had been approximately--

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.850
some of these individuals--

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:51.530
LIAM: I was nose-to-nose with her at the end there.

01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:53.334
LAURA: Okay, all right.
LIAM: Which is great.

01:20:53.334 --> 01:20:57.490
MATT: Right, she would have, let's say about right there.

01:20:57.490 --> 01:20:58.650
LAURA: You can't say shake and quiver.

01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.050
MATT: Withering around.
LAURA: You can't.

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:02.807
MATT: I know, every time.

01:21:02.807 --> 01:21:04.940
All right, Jester, you said you were?

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.460
LAURA: Above the arch.

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:08.536
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: So I was basically as close

01:21:08.536 --> 01:21:11.487
to the arch as I could get without landing on it, so yeah.

01:21:11.487 --> 01:21:13.020
MATT: About there, we'll say.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:15.070
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That only lasts an hour.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.410
MATT: Caduceus, where would you be?

01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:18.650
TALIESIN: I would have been in that little

01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:21.020
corner of the house, floating right

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.460
between those two-- yeah, towards you.

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.479
MATT: Over here?

01:21:25.479 --> 01:21:26.547
TALIESIN: Right there.

01:21:26.547 --> 01:21:27.850
LAURA: This is so cool looking, Matt.

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:28.993
TALIESIN: I'm terrible at this, hold on.

01:21:28.993 --> 01:21:32.230
MATT: That's what we have the pointers for.

01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:33.760
TALIESIN: Like flying over here.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.593
MATT: Over in this area?

01:21:34.593 --> 01:21:35.830
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.640
TALIESIN: Just watch-- a little more
closer to Caleb right there.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.962
MATT: Right there?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:21:42.962 --> 01:21:44.680
MATT: Okay, you got it.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.513
TRAVIS: Woo hoo!

01:21:45.513 --> 01:21:48.060
LIAM: Hey, my initiative is seven, I'll be back in flash.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.590
MATT: Essek would have been likely ready the defensive

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:54.769
point up on the rooftop of that building there.

01:21:54.769 --> 01:21:56.960
TALIESIN: I should've healed Essek.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.230
SAM: You healed us.

01:21:58.230 --> 01:21:59.063
TALIESIN: Not everybody.
LAURA: He didn't heal Essek.

01:21:59.063 --> 01:21:59.896
MATT: Not everybody.

01:21:59.896 --> 01:22:01.833
He's just taken a little bit of hurt, but he's not--

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.080
Actually, he's taken some hits.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.743
He's taken some hits.

01:22:07.235 --> 01:22:08.324
Yasha?

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:09.532
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:11.963
MATT: You said you were staying--

01:22:11.963 --> 01:22:13.660
ASHLEY: I wanted to be pretty close to Caleb.

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:14.800
MATT: Correct.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.030
ASHLEY: I hadn't touched the ground yet,

01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:18.960
but I feel like I'm pretty close,

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.870
hovering above the ground.

01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:22.570
MATT: Okay, we'll say you're about--

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.130
ASHLEY: Perfect, yeah.
MATT: -- here-ish?

01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:27.160
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:27.993
MATT: Okay.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.546
ASHLEY: Oh boy, okay, let me roll.

01:22:36.108 --> 01:22:37.830
LAURA: Do you think they'll all be immune,

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:39.080
everything here will be immune

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.520
to radiant and necrotic like the creatures in Aeor?

01:22:42.537 --> 01:22:44.160
MARISHA: Well, I think the creatures in Aeor--

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:44.993
MATT: Beau and Veth, you said

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.500
you were heading over towards the--

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.690
SAM: Yeah, we're near the--
LAURA: Were different?

01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:48.930
SAM: -- weather vane.
MATT: You got it.

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.810
TALIESIN: This is a whole other ball park.

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:53.850
MARISHA: Yeah, I think they were basically

01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:57.630
cloning god-fighting creatures.

01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:02.630
They were basically test tube creating

01:23:02.855 --> 01:23:05.979
an army to be resistant against gods.

01:23:05.979 --> 01:23:06.812
LAURA: Right.

01:23:06.812 --> 01:23:09.120
MARISHA: Is what I'm pretty sure was going on.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.916
TALIESIN: It's entirely possible that even

01:23:11.916 --> 01:23:14.422
a little psychic damage may go a long way, we don't know.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:15.255
MATT: And you know what? Since we are about

01:23:15.255 --> 01:23:17.410
to go into battle,

01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:19.030
let's go ahead and do initiative order

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:20.960
and then we'll probably jump to a break so we can go ahead

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.910
and use the restrooms and stuff before we jump into this.

01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:24.813
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: But to do that.

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.830
TALIESIN: This is going to be ugly.

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:30.290
LAURA: Yeah, that was the warning.

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:32.475
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: This could be a long night.

01:23:32.475 --> 01:23:33.533
ASHLEY: This is going to be rough.

01:23:33.533 --> 01:23:34.750
MATT: So 25 to 20?

01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:36.198
MARISHA: 21.

01:23:36.198 --> 01:23:37.266
MATT: 21, all righty.

01:23:37.266 --> 01:23:39.510
ASHLEY: 21, too. Woo!

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:41.580
MARISHA: My bae.
MATT: Beau, then Yasha.

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:43.124
ASHLEY: Baby!

01:23:43.124 --> 01:23:44.723
MATT: Hell yeah.

01:23:44.723 --> 01:23:46.650
Then we have 20 to 15?

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:48.140
TRAVIS: 16.

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.840
SAM: My initiative is brought

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.515
to you by Dwarven Forge and it's 17.

01:23:52.515 --> 01:23:54.646
MATT: 17.
SAM: bit.ly/CritRoleDF.

01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:57.320
TRAVIS: We were kind of talking over.

01:23:58.425 --> 01:24:00.320
MATT: Veth, then Fjord.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.840
15 to 10?

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.906
LAURA: 11.

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:12.120
MATT: All right, 10 to five?

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.453
SAM: (German accent) Caleb rolled a seven.

01:24:14.453 --> 01:24:16.611
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>
SAM: A soomphfs.

01:24:16.611 --> 01:24:18.240
TRAVIS: Caduceus?
MARISHA: That was pretty good.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.398
LIAM: <i>Sieben</i>.
LAURA: Oh no.

01:24:19.398 --> 01:24:20.589
SAM: Nope, it's a soomphfs.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.190
LIAM: Yeah, you're right.

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.357
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

01:24:23.357 --> 01:24:27.030
SAM: <i>Ich bin ein</i>, right? That's one, two, three?
TALIESIN: It's good. I can pick up anybody who dies.

01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:28.606
LAURA: That's true.
SAM: <i>Berliner</i>

01:24:28.606 --> 01:24:29.923
is four.
LIAM: That is <i>eins</i>.

01:24:29.923 --> 01:24:31.730
I am a doughnut.

01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:33.777
ASHLEY: Oh goodness.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:35.650
LAURA: What did Essek roll?

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:36.483
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

01:24:36.483 --> 01:24:38.201
MATT: He actually is the same as you.

01:24:38.201 --> 01:24:39.034
LAURA: Okay.

01:24:39.034 --> 01:24:41.280
MATT: But his dexterity is

01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.780
16. What's yours?

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.256
LAURA: My dex is 18.

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.710
TRAVIS: So Jester, Essek, Caleb, Caduceus.

01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:51.918
SAM: So the ones with

01:24:52.799 --> 01:24:56.710
the charcoal bases are the baddies?

01:24:56.710 --> 01:24:58.653
Is that right?

01:24:58.653 --> 01:25:00.015
TALIESIN: They're kind of meat-colored.

01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:02.743
SAM: Gross.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:25:07.558 --> 01:25:09.360
LIAM: And there's a little--
MATT: For those individuals.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.528
LIAM: -- meat lady with a diaper.
LAURA: I can't wait 'til

01:25:10.528 --> 01:25:13.104
we can be up close and personal with the map again.

01:25:13.104 --> 01:25:14.471
MARISHA: I know.
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:15.323
ASHLEY: I know.

01:25:15.323 --> 01:25:18.196
MATT: I know.
SAM: I don't. I like my table.

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:21.260
LAURA: I love having all the space.

01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.960
ASHLEY: Maybe we can wiggle in closer.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.709
LAURA: Yeah. I want be able to like--

01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:26.319
TRAVIS: ♪ Wiggle and quiff? ♪

01:25:26.319 --> 01:25:28.358
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:25:28.358 --> 01:25:29.441
MARISHA: Wiggle and quiff?

01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:33.374
MATT: All righty. With initiative set.

01:25:33.374 --> 01:25:35.010
All of the entities now burst

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:38.430
into terrifying fleshy abominations.

01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:40.581
LAURA: Oh cool, cool.
SAM: Just like Barbie dolls.

01:25:40.581 --> 01:25:41.536
MATT: Exactly (laughs).

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:43.675
TRAVIS: What an analogy.

01:25:43.675 --> 01:25:45.439
Whatever happened in Kentucky, man,

01:25:45.439 --> 01:25:47.371
just keep it in Kentucky, I don't know.

01:25:47.371 --> 01:25:49.620
MARISHA: They're like dolls, you know?

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:52.018
SAM: Tentacles with big eye faces.

01:25:52.018 --> 01:25:54.200
MARISHA: Yeah, and blue eyeshadow and pink lipstick.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.440
TRAVIS: Like Barbies.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.415
MATT: We'll go ahead and take a break.

01:25:56.415 --> 01:25:57.248
TRAVIS: Hey!

01:25:57.248 --> 01:25:59.530
MATT: So be back here in a few minutes to pick up

01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.682
for this combat and see where things go from here.

01:26:01.682 --> 01:26:02.515
LIAM: Yeet.

01:26:05.142 --> 01:26:09.502
So, you're the adventurer, as they'd been talking about.

01:26:09.502 --> 01:26:12.902
And you've come to seek my guidance.

01:26:12.902 --> 01:26:16.392
I've battled the most unspeakable horrors to crawl

01:26:16.392 --> 01:26:19.292
upon the face of this tainted land.

01:26:19.292 --> 01:26:21.082
Even faced evils

01:26:21.082 --> 01:26:24.712
that claw and nash from twisted forms,

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:27.435
bent on destruction and slaughter.

01:26:28.482 --> 01:26:29.315
Though,

01:26:29.315 --> 01:26:33.575
it is the monsters inside us that take the greatest toll.

01:26:35.092 --> 01:26:37.632
Your tools will be your life.

01:26:37.632 --> 01:26:39.672
Every elixir, potion,

01:26:39.672 --> 01:26:43.445
and concoction, a powerful weapon on your hands.

01:26:44.392 --> 01:26:47.802
Each victory will bring you closer to your next,

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:51.842
equipping you to face the darkness of this land.

01:26:51.842 --> 01:26:54.472
Failing is not an option,

01:26:54.472 --> 01:26:57.715
lest a fate, far worse than death greet you.

01:26:58.722 --> 01:27:00.042
So tell me,

01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:03.572
strangers, do you tremble at night?

01:27:03.572 --> 01:27:05.655
Haunted by visions of the dead?

01:27:06.592 --> 01:27:09.202
Does the sound of the Inferno,

01:27:09.202 --> 01:27:12.855
rattling their demonic chains chill your blood?

01:27:13.802 --> 01:27:16.772
Do you cower at the thought of losing

01:27:16.772 --> 01:27:18.172
all you love

01:27:18.172 --> 01:27:21.172
to the corruption of the beast?

01:27:21.172 --> 01:27:22.362
No?

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:26.882
Well, perhaps you have what it takes.

01:27:26.882 --> 01:27:31.332
With this tome of knowledge, your training begins.

01:27:31.332 --> 01:27:33.775
Let's see how far you get.

01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:38.916
(dragon breathing fire)

01:27:42.352 --> 01:27:44.792
This is everything you need to know about our terrain

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.382
in 60 seconds.

01:27:46.382 --> 01:27:48.282
We hand sculpt our pieces

01:27:48.282 --> 01:27:49.732
for maximum detail and artistry,

01:27:49.732 --> 01:27:52.742
infusing passion into every millimeter of our work.

01:27:52.742 --> 01:27:54.802
Everything is available, beautifully hand painted

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.552
so you can start playing right away.

01:27:56.552 --> 01:27:59.302
Or you can choose unpainted to paint everything yourself.

01:27:59.302 --> 01:28:01.012
Our pieces are completely modular,

01:28:01.012 --> 01:28:03.502
so you can use the same sets to create a new adventure,

01:28:03.502 --> 01:28:04.482
every time.

01:28:04.482 --> 01:28:06.502
we create everything out of Dwarvenite,

01:28:06.502 --> 01:28:10.282
our top secret PVC formula that's nearly indestructible.

01:28:10.282 --> 01:28:13.152
We pack our pieces with as many features as possible,

01:28:13.152 --> 01:28:14.782
such as swappable LED's

01:28:14.782 --> 01:28:16.742
to quickly change the look of your scene.

01:28:16.742 --> 01:28:18.992
We offer magnetic accessories to add flavor

01:28:18.992 --> 01:28:20.482
or increase the danger.

01:28:20.482 --> 01:28:23.662
A one inch tactical grid is sculpted into our floors.

01:28:23.662 --> 01:28:25.212
We offer a range of environments

01:28:25.212 --> 01:28:28.662
including dungeons, caverns, cities, castles, sewers, forest

01:28:28.662 --> 01:28:31.382
mountains, streets, burrows, ice, and hellscape.

01:28:31.382 --> 01:28:33.024
And that's just the beginning.

01:28:33.024 --> 01:28:34.972
That's everything you need to know

01:28:34.972 --> 01:28:38.432
about Dwarven Forge in 60 seconds.

01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:48.421
(fantasy music)

01:29:17.896 --> 01:29:20.729
(keyboard typing)

01:29:42.912 --> 01:29:45.052
Hey critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:47.435
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role Shop.

01:29:50.062 --> 01:29:51.252
I mean, a traveler always says

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:53.615
impulse purchases are a good decision.

01:29:55.622 --> 01:29:58.052
Roll an investigation, if you want.

01:29:58.052 --> 01:29:59.205
It's basically perfect.

01:30:01.612 --> 01:30:03.022
Go ahead, darling.

01:30:03.022 --> 01:30:04.195
Treat yourself.

01:30:07.242 --> 01:30:09.182
This is, this is a lot of stuff you guys.

01:30:09.182 --> 01:30:11.905
We have like, so many cool things right now.

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:14.162
(tea bag dipping into tea)

01:30:14.162 --> 01:30:15.819
I mean, seriously, look,

01:30:15.819 --> 01:30:17.005
I have this thing.

01:30:18.723 --> 01:30:19.642
(clicking)

01:30:19.642 --> 01:30:22.246
So click on over to the Critical Role Shop.

01:30:22.246 --> 01:30:23.079
(laughing)

01:30:23.079 --> 01:30:24.722
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break,

01:30:24.722 --> 01:30:25.672
you still got time.

01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:32.402
(upbeat jazz music)

01:30:32.402 --> 01:30:33.802
Hello everyone.

01:30:33.802 --> 01:30:34.932
It's me.

01:30:34.932 --> 01:30:36.212
Marisha Ray,

01:30:36.212 --> 01:30:38.972
creative director for Critical Role content.

01:30:38.972 --> 01:30:40.432
And I want to take a moment to speak

01:30:40.432 --> 01:30:44.152
from the heart about how much we appreciate your support.

01:30:44.152 --> 01:30:46.802
No frills, no crazy gags.

01:30:46.802 --> 01:30:48.562
Just honesty.

01:30:48.562 --> 01:30:49.712
Over the past five years

01:30:49.712 --> 01:30:52.402
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

01:30:52.402 --> 01:30:55.852
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

01:30:55.852 --> 01:30:58.382
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor,

01:30:58.382 --> 01:31:00.002
cheap costumes,

01:31:00.002 --> 01:31:01.872
and putting our loyal employees

01:31:01.872 --> 01:31:03.722
in slightly embarrassing situations,

01:31:03.722 --> 01:31:06.882
eagerly hoping that we've captured your attention.

01:31:06.882 --> 01:31:10.382
Today, I am not resorting to edge lord jokes,

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:12.952
written by Brian W. Foster,

01:31:12.952 --> 01:31:15.002
Or dressing Sam as a celebrity

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:17.042
to recreate an obscure commercial

01:31:17.042 --> 01:31:18.862
most people haven't seen,

01:31:18.862 --> 01:31:21.852
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch prime account

01:31:21.852 --> 01:31:24.662
requires you to resubscribe each month.

01:31:24.662 --> 01:31:28.042
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag,

01:31:28.042 --> 01:31:30.572
or have to put Matt in cosplay to tell you

01:31:30.572 --> 01:31:33.592
that you can easily give subscriptions to fellow Critters.

01:31:33.592 --> 01:31:35.302
If you're feeling generous.

01:31:35.302 --> 01:31:36.162
I mean, hell,

01:31:36.162 --> 01:31:39.172
I've consumed entire production days

01:31:39.172 --> 01:31:41.202
shooting complicated parody promos

01:31:41.202 --> 01:31:44.192
featuring Taliesin Jaffe as a vintage spooky boy

01:31:44.192 --> 01:31:46.542
and full monochromatic glory.

01:31:46.542 --> 01:31:47.652
All in the hope

01:31:47.652 --> 01:31:50.435
that your smile may turn into a sub,

01:31:51.522 --> 01:31:52.655
but not today.

01:31:53.702 --> 01:31:55.672
No weird graphics,

01:31:55.672 --> 01:31:57.015
no puppet murder.

01:31:58.402 --> 01:31:59.715
No Sam Riegel.

01:32:03.412 --> 01:32:04.312
It's just me

01:32:05.492 --> 01:32:06.345
here to say,

01:32:07.482 --> 01:32:08.315
thank you.

01:32:09.542 --> 01:32:10.375
Love you all,

01:32:12.022 --> 01:32:12.855
good night.

01:45:05.224 --> 01:45:06.364
MATT: And welcome back.

01:45:06.364 --> 01:45:10.228
We're going to jump into this initiative order in combat.

01:45:10.228 --> 01:45:11.061
LIAM: Oh!

01:45:11.061 --> 01:45:13.264
MARISHA: Oh shit!
LAURA: Oh god!

01:45:13.264 --> 01:45:15.029
MATT: Right now.
SAM: Oh, we didn't strategize!

01:45:15.029 --> 01:45:16.295
MARISHA: We didn't strategize at all.

01:45:16.295 --> 01:45:18.029
LIAM: We don't know anything about them.

01:45:18.029 --> 01:45:19.162
TRAVIS: Talking about tugboating.

01:45:19.162 --> 01:45:21.067
MATT: But that's fine. Beau, you're up first.

01:45:21.067 --> 01:45:23.064
MARISHA and LAURA: (screaming)

01:45:23.064 --> 01:45:25.334
MARISHA: So all these fleshy things are mad at us

01:45:25.334 --> 01:45:26.274
is essentially it?

01:45:26.274 --> 01:45:28.687
All these fleshy things are fair game?
MATT: I mean, you don't know.

01:45:28.687 --> 01:45:32.323
TRAVIS: It seems like a pretty primal display.
LAURA: They seem pretty terrible, yeah.

01:45:32.323 --> 01:45:35.030
MARISHA: Where's the grandma that split in half?

01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:36.013
LIAM: In front of Caleb.
TRAVIS: Colors and actions

01:45:36.013 --> 01:45:37.944
in nature that seem aggressive.

01:45:37.944 --> 01:45:39.827
MARISHA: Okay, well.

01:45:41.564 --> 01:45:43.514
Do I get any weird feelings

01:45:43.514 --> 01:45:46.237
or thoughts from the eyeballs that are on my body?

01:45:47.484 --> 01:45:49.114
MATT: At the moment?

01:45:49.114 --> 01:45:50.864
Not anything different

01:45:50.864 --> 01:45:52.594
than you've been sensing since you got here.

01:45:52.594 --> 01:45:54.101
MARISHA: Okay, please don't barf.

01:45:54.101 --> 01:45:55.142
Oh god.
LIAM: (growling)

01:45:55.142 --> 01:45:56.769
MARISHA: I'm going to--
LAURA: Ooh.

01:45:56.769 --> 01:45:57.602
TRAVIS: (lip trill)

01:45:57.602 --> 01:46:00.274
MARISHA: I'm going to jump in and head towards

01:46:00.274 --> 01:46:04.044
the one that was getting up in Caleb's face.

01:46:04.044 --> 01:46:07.544
MATT: Okay, are you using your base movement onto the ground

01:46:07.544 --> 01:46:10.534
or are you going to use your intellect

01:46:10.534 --> 01:46:12.309
to will yourself to move?

01:46:13.664 --> 01:46:16.124
MARISHA: Well, in all honesty,

01:46:16.124 --> 01:46:18.688
they're pretty close to the same.

01:46:18.688 --> 01:46:21.021
MATT: Fair enough.
MARISHA: One is speed of 55,

01:46:21.021 --> 01:46:23.431
and the other is the speed of, like, 57

01:46:23.431 --> 01:46:25.124
because it's 19 times three.

01:46:25.124 --> 01:46:26.734
MATT: Fair enough.

01:46:26.734 --> 01:46:31.703
MARISHA: So I will use my brain.

01:46:32.914 --> 01:46:34.729
LIAM: Check out the brain on Beau.

01:46:34.729 --> 01:46:36.614
(laughter)

01:46:36.614 --> 01:46:38.394
SAM: So wait, we're still unaffected

01:46:38.394 --> 01:46:40.583
by gravity up here, Matty?

01:46:40.583 --> 01:46:42.024
MATT: No, you can feel the tug of it.

01:46:42.024 --> 01:46:45.049
You can choose whether or not to go by gravity.

01:46:45.049 --> 01:46:47.782
TRAVIS: Laura, come on.

01:46:48.774 --> 01:46:50.383
TALIESIN: I thought we finally got past that.

01:46:50.383 --> 01:46:52.625
LIAM: Hey, come on.
TRAVIS: Come on.

01:46:52.625 --> 01:46:53.883
LIAM: After the last two hours,

01:46:53.883 --> 01:46:55.094
what'd you expect?

01:46:55.094 --> 01:46:56.341
(laughter)

01:46:56.341 --> 01:46:57.693
TRAVIS: This started like an hour and a half ago.

01:46:57.693 --> 01:46:59.633
LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:46:59.633 --> 01:47:01.399
(laughter)

01:47:01.399 --> 01:47:04.665
SAM: You can choose to go by intelligence speed

01:47:04.665 --> 01:47:06.465
or tugboat.

01:47:06.465 --> 01:47:09.354
MATT: As you will yourself off

01:47:09.354 --> 01:47:11.384
of the top of this and glide downward

01:47:12.334 --> 01:47:14.977
MARISHA: I guess, let me get to the ground.

01:47:16.716 --> 01:47:18.394
Because that'll be my move, I guess.

01:47:18.394 --> 01:47:19.227
MATT: Correct.

01:47:19.227 --> 01:47:20.760
MARISHA: So let me move as far as I can

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:22.701
to the ground.
MATT: That would be about to there.

01:47:24.174 --> 01:47:25.727
MARISHA: Which has me how far away?

01:47:27.133 --> 01:47:28.407
Like 15-ish feet?

01:47:28.407 --> 01:47:31.564
MATT: Yeah, 10 feet away.

01:47:31.564 --> 01:47:33.131
MARISHA: 10 feet away.

01:47:33.131 --> 01:47:33.964
Okay, yeah.

01:47:33.964 --> 01:47:36.034
I might as well Step of the Wind to get there.

01:47:36.034 --> 01:47:37.954
MATT: Okay, let's do it.

01:47:37.954 --> 01:47:38.796
TRAVIS: As she moves,

01:47:38.796 --> 01:47:41.306
do we see her literally move in a diagonal?

01:47:41.306 --> 01:47:44.562
MATT: Yeah, you see her glide down, touch on the ground,

01:47:44.562 --> 01:47:47.284
and go into an immediate run towards it.

01:47:47.284 --> 01:47:48.317
As you approach.

01:47:50.564 --> 01:47:51.595
TRAVIS: What does the ground do

01:47:51.595 --> 01:47:53.045
as her feet leave the pavement?

01:47:53.045 --> 01:47:55.219
Is it that same (sucking) thing?

01:47:55.219 --> 01:47:56.052
MARISHA: Good question.

01:47:58.174 --> 01:48:00.023
MATT: Right now, it's just stone.

01:48:00.023 --> 01:48:01.564
Nothing different.

01:48:01.564 --> 01:48:02.397
SAM: Right now.

01:48:02.397 --> 01:48:06.134
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take out my staff

01:48:06.134 --> 01:48:09.391
and give it a nice little twirl behind my back

01:48:09.391 --> 01:48:11.704
and just start laying into this thing

01:48:11.704 --> 01:48:13.422
and see what I can do.

01:48:13.422 --> 01:48:15.046
MATT: (coughs) Oh yeah, one-two.
MARISHA: I don't know what going to happen.

01:48:15.046 --> 01:48:15.949
You all right, baby?

01:48:15.949 --> 01:48:17.340
MATT: I'm good. (coughs)

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.748
Go ahead.
MARISHA: Inhaled some spit?

01:48:18.748 --> 01:48:19.581
MATT: Inhaled some drink.

01:48:19.581 --> 01:48:20.832
MARISHA: A-pop pop!
MATT: Pardon me.

01:48:22.188 --> 01:48:26.884
MARISHA: The first one is a natural 19 for a 31 to hit.

01:48:26.884 --> 01:48:30.734
And then the second one is 21.

01:48:30.734 --> 01:48:32.887
MATT: Oh great, both those hit.

01:48:32.887 --> 01:48:34.291
MARISHA: Both of those hit, okay.

01:48:37.049 --> 01:48:40.344
(gibberish) Okay.

01:48:40.344 --> 01:48:42.910
The first one is 10 damage.

01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:44.670
MATT: 10 damage, all right.

01:48:44.670 --> 01:48:45.807
MARISHA: 10 damage!

01:48:45.807 --> 01:48:46.640
Stunning Strike.

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.765
Let's see if I can even stun these things.

01:48:48.765 --> 01:48:50.432
LIAM: Stunning once, stunning twice.

01:48:51.444 --> 01:48:53.415
MARISHA: Sold to the monk in the corner.

01:48:54.874 --> 01:48:56.894
MATT: It is not stunned.

01:48:56.894 --> 01:48:58.644
MARISHA: It is not stunned, but you rolled?

01:49:00.374 --> 01:49:01.844
I thought I heard a clanky clank.

01:49:01.844 --> 01:49:02.929
Did I hear a clanky clank?
TRAVIS: He did.

01:49:02.929 --> 01:49:05.868
MARISHA: All right, cool.

01:49:05.868 --> 01:49:06.701
TRAVIS: Couldn't tell you that he looked

01:49:06.701 --> 01:49:08.242
at what he rolled, though.

01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:11.204
MARISHA: Yeah, mm-hmm.
LAURA: Hmm.

01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:13.283
MARISHA: Hmm.

01:49:15.044 --> 01:49:18.154
The second is 11 points of damage

01:49:18.154 --> 01:49:19.272
MATT: 11, all righty.

01:49:23.274 --> 01:49:26.064
MARISHA: And I'm going to Flurry of Blows from here.

01:49:26.064 --> 01:49:27.734
MATT: You've already used your bonus action

01:49:27.734 --> 01:49:29.063
to Step into the Wind.

01:49:29.063 --> 01:49:32.632
MARISHA: Fuck. You are right.

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:33.773
That's it, that's my turn.

01:49:33.773 --> 01:49:36.040
LIAM: Did it look like Beauregard hit the thing

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.194
and it reacted and recoiled?

01:49:38.194 --> 01:49:40.592
MATT: It took hits and was like (impacts, grunting).

01:49:40.592 --> 01:49:45.014
But it's like punching a waterbed, almost.

01:49:45.014 --> 01:49:46.804
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: And as soon as you recoil,

01:49:46.804 --> 01:49:48.761
teeth begin to emerge where the impacts were

01:49:48.761 --> 01:49:50.344
and drift along the outside

01:49:50.344 --> 01:49:52.104
and you see eyes open and then whip

01:49:52.104 --> 01:49:53.504
and then appear elsewhere within the body

01:49:53.504 --> 01:49:56.414
and undulates and changes shape.

01:49:56.414 --> 01:49:59.964
MARISHA: Does it look familiar to our eyes or?

01:49:59.964 --> 01:50:04.354
MATT: No, like actual like humanoid, whites and irises eyes.

01:50:04.354 --> 01:50:05.964
MARISHA: Okay, great.

01:50:05.964 --> 01:50:06.797
MATT: All right.

01:50:06.797 --> 01:50:07.930
ASHLEY: I don't like it, I don't like it.

01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:09.194
MATT: That finishes Beauregard's turn.

01:50:09.194 --> 01:50:11.094
Yasha, you're up, with Veth on deck.

01:50:11.094 --> 01:50:15.374
ASHLEY: Okay, is that a bird on top of the fountain?

01:50:15.374 --> 01:50:17.584
MATT: It is a sculpture of a bird, not an actual bird.

01:50:17.584 --> 01:50:18.417
LIAM: Kill it.

01:50:18.417 --> 01:50:19.751
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over the bird.

01:50:19.751 --> 01:50:20.584
MATT: At the start of your turn--

01:50:20.584 --> 01:50:22.180
ASHLEY: No, no.
TRAVIS: What's that doing here?

01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:23.354
(laughter)

01:50:23.354 --> 01:50:24.470
MATT: -- you begin to hear,

01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:26.439
for those who are in the proximity,

01:50:26.439 --> 01:50:29.034
all of the mouths that are undulating and shaping

01:50:29.034 --> 01:50:31.911
and reverting are now beginning to scream

01:50:31.911 --> 01:50:33.151
together.
LAURA: Oh no.

01:50:33.151 --> 01:50:35.164
MATT: And the screams are filling the air

01:50:35.164 --> 01:50:36.821
and those that are nearby them right now.

01:50:36.821 --> 01:50:39.764
Yasha, you are feeling the screams piercing

01:50:39.764 --> 01:50:41.054
into your ears and your mind.

01:50:41.054 --> 01:50:44.809
I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

01:50:45.844 --> 01:50:47.424
ASHLEY: My sword?

01:50:47.424 --> 01:50:48.257
Do I--?

01:50:49.091 --> 01:50:50.144
MATT: You get the bonus from your sword.

01:50:50.144 --> 01:50:50.977
Yeah.

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:52.334
ASHLEY: Just seeing if I needed to take it out

01:50:52.334 --> 01:50:53.167
or anything like that.

01:50:53.167 --> 01:50:54.214
Okay, okay.

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:55.414
TRAVIS: It should be out, yes.

01:50:56.874 --> 01:50:58.054
ASHLEY: I mean, I wanted it out.

01:50:58.054 --> 01:50:59.714
I didn't know if he was going to let me do it.

01:50:59.714 --> 01:51:00.547
Okay, come on,

01:51:00.547 --> 01:51:01.780
you got to roll well.
MATT: You can draw a weapon

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.232
as part of your action, so.

01:51:04.232 --> 01:51:07.318

MATT: First strike, you carve through it

01:52:31.804 --> 01:52:34.164
and you watch as a large part of its body

01:52:34.164 --> 01:52:37.164
sloughs off onto the ground

01:52:37.164 --> 01:52:41.214
and then begins to disperse a reddish-purple liquid,

01:52:41.214 --> 01:52:42.564
and then slowly begin to seep

01:52:42.564 --> 01:52:44.984
into the ground and become cobblestone once more.

01:52:44.984 --> 01:52:46.124
Much of it still remains,

01:52:46.124 --> 01:52:49.494
but it is heavily, heavily wounded.

01:53:08.834 --> 01:53:10.214
to get around the back

01:53:10.214 --> 01:53:14.334
and inside the clock tower there or whatever that tower is?

01:53:14.334 --> 01:53:16.214
MATT: You could. How far can you fly with your intelligence?

01:53:16.214 --> 01:53:17.534
SAM: 46 feet.

01:53:17.534 --> 01:53:19.244
MATT: Easy enough to do, yeah.

01:53:19.244 --> 01:53:20.094
If you'd like to.

01:53:23.984 --> 01:53:26.404
SAM: But around the back,
so they don't see me going in.

01:53:26.404 --> 01:53:27.377
MATT: Correct, so.

01:53:28.914 --> 01:53:30.264
SAM: Ugh.
TRAVIS: Weird.

01:53:30.264 --> 01:53:31.844
I saw it separate and then didn't separate.

01:53:31.844 --> 01:53:33.194
MATT: Yeah, it's being a little wonky there.

01:53:33.194 --> 01:53:34.027
It's okay.

01:53:36.364 --> 01:53:37.764
SAM: Oh boy.

01:53:37.764 --> 01:53:40.484
MATT: So with that, you drift through

01:53:40.484 --> 01:53:41.974
and then fly through the space

01:53:41.974 --> 01:53:44.318
and you can definitely make it within the inside of this.

01:53:44.318 --> 01:53:48.161
SAM: Okay, and then I'll sort of bonus action hide,

01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:49.394

SAM: Yeah, I will tell it a joke.

01:54:27.444 --> 01:54:30.164

01:58:37.715 --> 01:58:39.032
MATT: This one's going to go ahead and move.

01:58:39.032 --> 01:58:39.969
SAM: Flesh Hoarders?

01:58:39.969 --> 01:58:41.127
LIAM: Hor<i>rors</i>.

01:58:41.127 --> 01:58:43.024
SAM: Hurrur.
LIAM: Hurror. Hahrah.

01:58:43.024 --> 01:58:48.024
MATT: This one is going to move 20 feet up to Caleb there.

01:58:48.024 --> 01:58:48.857
LIAM: Oh good.

01:58:50.324 --> 01:58:51.287
MATT: Oh god.
LAURA: Oh god.

01:58:51.287 --> 01:58:52.120
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:53.220
MATT: This one's going to go ahead and move

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.924
20 feet up to there.

01:58:55.924 --> 01:58:58.957
That's as far as it can get on its movement.

01:59:00.034 --> 01:59:02.994
This one's going to move 20 feet up to there.

01:59:02.994 --> 01:59:04.567
This one can't do anything right now.

01:59:04.567 --> 01:59:07.354
Go ahead and to move 20 feet up to here.

01:59:07.354 --> 01:59:09.344
You get the immediate sense that they can't travel quickly.

01:59:09.344 --> 01:59:12.664
As they (slurping), some of them slide

01:59:12.664 --> 01:59:17.072
like that one grandmother corpse did earlier,

01:59:17.072 --> 01:59:19.384
but she was being puppeted by something else

01:59:19.384 --> 01:59:22.464
and had alacrity that these lack in the moment.

01:59:22.464 --> 01:59:23.397
TRAVIS: Oh, interesting.

01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:28.904
MATT: So those three, four can't do anything, but those two,

01:59:28.904 --> 01:59:30.066
one's going to go after Caleb,

01:59:30.066 --> 01:59:31.766
and one's going to go after Beauregard.

01:59:32.944 --> 01:59:34.685
Caleb, attacking you.

01:59:34.685 --> 01:59:35.894
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Caleb!

01:59:35.894 --> 01:59:36.824
MATT: 26?

01:59:36.824 --> 01:59:38.480
LIAM: Hits.

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.313
MATT: And

01:59:40.974 --> 01:59:41.864
12.

01:59:41.864 --> 01:59:43.456
MARISHA: Miss.

01:59:43.456 --> 01:59:44.709
MATT: Well, that was against--
LIAM: Damage.

01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:46.292
MARISHA: Oh, thought that was one and two.

01:59:46.292 --> 01:59:48.507
MATT: No, that wasn't damage, that was to hit.

01:59:48.507 --> 01:59:49.340
LIAM: To hit me?

01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:50.873
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Oh, a 12 against me?

01:59:50.873 --> 01:59:52.444
MATT: Yes. So that misses.
LIAM: Oh, so I didn't get-- no.

01:59:52.444 --> 01:59:55.437
MATT: So the Torrent of Teeth
does get to you.

01:59:55.437 --> 01:59:57.604
MARISHA and SAM: The Torrent of Teeth.

01:59:57.604 --> 01:59:58.794
TRAVIS: These are all friendly names.

01:59:58.794 --> 02:00:00.461
TALIESIN: I stopped using Torrents years ago.

02:00:00.461 --> 02:00:01.894
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:00:01.894 --> 02:00:03.754
TALIESIN: This is exactly why.
MATT: It's for the best, yeah.

02:00:03.754 --> 02:00:06.497
All right, so you take...

02:00:12.224 --> 02:00:13.599
32 points of piercing damage.

02:00:13.599 --> 02:00:15.188
LIAM: Oh my.

02:00:15.188 --> 02:00:16.834
TRAVIS: 32 points of piercing damage.

02:00:16.834 --> 02:00:18.144
MATT: Correct.

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:19.714
And I need you to make a strength saving throw.

02:00:19.714 --> 02:00:20.547
LIAM: I'm good at that.

02:00:20.547 --> 02:00:21.794
ASHLEY: Is he within 10 feet of me?

02:00:22.704 --> 02:00:25.527
MATT: He is.

02:00:25.527 --> 02:00:27.144
ASHLEY: You have advantage.

02:00:27.144 --> 02:00:28.144
LIAM: Thank you.

02:00:30.032 --> 02:00:31.824
Ooh, I rolled an 18 and a 19.

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:32.727
So 19.

02:00:33.944 --> 02:00:36.277
MATT: You watch as a tendril goes out and wraps

02:00:36.277 --> 02:00:38.794
around your body and you feel like you're being buzz sawed

02:00:38.794 --> 02:00:40.694
from multiple positions in your torso

02:00:40.694 --> 02:00:42.254
and you manage to tear yourself away

02:00:42.254 --> 02:00:44.494
as it tries to wrestle you to the ground.

02:00:44.494 --> 02:00:45.484
You're fine.

02:00:45.484 --> 02:00:46.742
Other than the damage you took.

02:00:47.759 --> 02:00:49.059
As it pulls back,

02:00:49.059 --> 02:00:51.404
these tentacles whip back towards you

02:00:51.404 --> 02:00:54.184
and you just back down and the staff gives

02:00:54.184 --> 02:00:57.527
an immediate shield and they reflect off, no impact.

02:00:58.534 --> 02:00:59.367
Beauregard.

02:01:00.314 --> 02:01:01.147
TRAVIS: Interesting.

02:01:01.147 --> 02:01:03.524
MATT: That is a 23 to hit.

02:01:03.524 --> 02:01:04.964
MARISHA: That hits.

02:01:04.964 --> 02:01:07.394
MATT: And 19 to hit.

02:01:07.394 --> 02:01:08.824
MARISHA: Miss.

02:01:08.824 --> 02:01:12.087
MATT: All right, so
Torrent of Teeth against you.

02:01:13.429 --> 02:01:14.262
Okay.

02:01:16.154 --> 02:01:17.034
LIAM: Are they rangy?

02:01:17.034 --> 02:01:19.594
Are they slorping out over 10 feet?

02:01:19.594 --> 02:01:20.477
TRAVIS: Slorping out.

02:01:20.477 --> 02:01:22.454
MATT: They're right next to you, so you don't know.

02:01:22.454 --> 02:01:23.888
LIAM: Can't tell.

02:01:23.888 --> 02:01:27.291
MATT: That would be 34 points of piercing damage

02:01:27.291 --> 02:01:30.004
as the teeth grind into your body.

02:01:30.004 --> 02:01:32.004
And you manage to force yourself out of the way,

02:01:32.004 --> 02:01:34.804
hopefully, if you make a strength saving throw, please.

02:01:36.878 --> 02:01:38.522
ASHLEY: Within 10 feet?

02:01:38.522 --> 02:01:39.355
MATT: Yes.

02:01:39.355 --> 02:01:40.870
MARISHA: Strength saving throw.

02:01:42.919 --> 02:01:44.382
Not good, 15 total.

02:01:44.382 --> 02:01:46.024
ASHLEY: You get to roll again.

02:01:46.024 --> 02:01:49.114
Because I have Holy Avenger, so hopefully you get better.

02:01:49.114 --> 02:01:51.987
MARISHA: That is better, 18 total.

02:01:53.494 --> 02:01:55.644
TRAVIS: Checking the Avenger, I think.

02:01:55.644 --> 02:01:57.704
MATT: Yeah, just double check.

02:01:57.704 --> 02:01:59.354
TRAVIS: Is it anybody, or once per turn?

02:02:00.214 --> 02:02:03.434
ASHLEY: "Creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you.

02:02:03.434 --> 02:02:04.914
"You and all creatures friendly to you

02:02:04.914 --> 02:02:07.084
"in the aura have advantage on saving throws

02:02:07.084 --> 02:02:09.574
"against... spells another magical effects."

02:02:09.574 --> 02:02:10.800
MATT: That's what I was going to check.

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.449
MARISHA: Oh.
ASHLEY: Yeah, sorry.

02:02:12.449 --> 02:02:13.722
My bad.

02:02:13.722 --> 02:02:14.954
MATT: It's okay.

02:02:14.954 --> 02:02:16.664
MATT: You rolled well last time, so you're fine.

02:02:16.664 --> 02:02:19.358
That first one, what was the first one you were rolled?

02:02:19.358 --> 02:02:20.333
MARISHA: A 15.

02:02:20.333 --> 02:02:22.068
MATT: 15 is just what you needed, anyway.

02:02:22.068 --> 02:02:25.181
MARISHA: (relieved sigh)
TRAVIS: Ooh, Beau.

02:02:25.181 --> 02:02:26.014
MATT: So you take the damage,

02:02:26.014 --> 02:02:27.844
but it does not wrestle you to the ground.

02:02:27.844 --> 02:02:29.368
TRAVIS: Don't go in the wood shop.
MATT: And the second attack,

02:02:29.368 --> 02:02:31.785
as tentacles try and whip out towards you.

02:02:31.785 --> 02:02:32.854
MARISHA: Okay.

02:02:32.854 --> 02:02:35.147
MATT: You manage to just knock it away with the staff.

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:37.380
MARISHA: Yeah, ah!

02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:39.054
MATT: That finishes their turn.

02:02:39.054 --> 02:02:41.706
So they're not terribly hardy,

02:02:41.706 --> 02:02:43.205
but they definitely pack a punch.

02:02:43.205 --> 02:02:44.584
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:02:44.584 --> 02:02:48.764
MATT: That brings us to Jester, with Essek on deck.

02:02:48.764 --> 02:02:50.414
Jester, what would you like to do?

02:02:52.674 --> 02:02:55.548
LAURA: I'm going to--

02:02:55.548 --> 02:02:56.748
TRAVIS: Rage?

02:02:56.748 --> 02:02:58.640
LAURA: I would like to rage!

02:02:58.640 --> 02:02:59.890
I'm going to...

02:03:01.081 --> 02:03:04.114
cast Guiding Bolt,

02:03:05.604 --> 02:03:08.754
but I'm going to use my ring of spell splitting.

02:03:08.754 --> 02:03:10.787
So I'm going to aim at

02:03:13.684 --> 02:03:15.917
one of them in the midst of the group.

02:03:17.164 --> 02:03:18.314
MATT: All right, which one?

02:03:19.434 --> 02:03:21.444
There's two of them that have been hit.

02:03:21.444 --> 02:03:22.704
This one's been hit.

02:03:22.704 --> 02:03:24.124
LAURA: Okay.

02:03:24.124 --> 02:03:26.208
MATT: Or sorry, both of the ones that are right there

02:03:26.208 --> 02:03:27.774
up in the middle of the fray have been hit.

02:03:27.774 --> 02:03:28.764
LAURA: Okay.

02:03:28.764 --> 02:03:30.624
I'll do the one closest to the wall.

02:03:30.624 --> 02:03:31.790
MATT: Okay.

02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:36.790
LAURA: And then I'll also do the one

02:03:36.931 --> 02:03:38.006
down on the other side

02:03:38.006 --> 02:03:41.667
in between the circular tower and me.

02:03:43.047 --> 02:03:44.564
MATT: Over this way?

02:03:45.624 --> 02:03:46.914
LAURA: Yeah, that one that you were just pointing at.

02:03:46.914 --> 02:03:47.747
MATT: Gotcha. So those two.

02:03:47.747 --> 02:03:50.204
LAURA: And this is a 3rd-level spell.

02:03:50.204 --> 02:03:51.118
MATT: You got it.

02:03:51.118 --> 02:03:52.629
So go ahead and roll for attacks on each.

02:03:54.854 --> 02:03:58.604
You're noticing with this, the weird, wild, strange

02:03:58.604 --> 02:04:02.174
magic of Aeor that was based in the crash of

02:04:02.174 --> 02:04:04.754
the ruins does not reach to this space.

02:04:04.754 --> 02:04:05.894
So you don't have to worry about that.

02:04:05.894 --> 02:04:06.744
LAURA: Oh great.

02:04:06.744 --> 02:04:08.494
Woo, both of those are really good.

02:04:09.484 --> 02:04:11.194
A 25 and a 28.

02:04:11.194 --> 02:04:12.769
MATT: Both hit. Let's go ahead and roll damage once

02:04:12.769 --> 02:04:14.277
and they both take it.
LAURA: Okay.

02:04:14.277 --> 02:04:16.315
So that's 6d6.

02:04:16.315 --> 02:04:17.148
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:04:22.514 --> 02:04:24.114
LAURA: That's great.

02:04:24.114 --> 02:04:26.380
11, 16,

02:04:28.047 --> 02:04:31.104
22, 24,

02:04:31.104 --> 02:04:33.194
radiant damage to both of them.

02:04:33.194 --> 02:04:34.614
And they're both--

02:04:34.614 --> 02:04:36.354
The next hit has advantage.

02:04:36.354 --> 02:04:37.487
MATT: Indeed.
SAM: Nice.

02:04:37.487 --> 02:04:39.164
MATT: The next hit on this one gets advantage.

02:04:39.164 --> 02:04:43.674
This one, as you slam it with the Guiding Bolt,

02:04:43.674 --> 02:04:45.629
it impacts and it screeches.

02:04:45.629 --> 02:04:48.304
The screams suddenly becoming a dozen

02:04:48.304 --> 02:04:51.670
to a hundred and then it just burns away into ash.

02:04:51.670 --> 02:04:53.464
(swishing)

02:04:53.464 --> 02:04:54.439
And is gone.

02:04:55.834 --> 02:04:56.734
In the middle of the screams,

02:04:56.734 --> 02:05:00.300
you briefly hear a sigh of relief.

02:05:01.274 --> 02:05:02.249
LIAM: Free from hell.

02:05:02.249 --> 02:05:03.323
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Oh god.

02:05:03.323 --> 02:05:05.194
MARISHA: Let go.

02:05:05.194 --> 02:05:06.777
MATT: You want to move? Stay put?

02:05:08.064 --> 02:05:10.415
LAURA: I'm going to rise up.

02:05:10.415 --> 02:05:12.857
I'm going to rise up!
TRAVIS: Rage rise up!

02:05:12.857 --> 02:05:15.724
MARISHA: Raise, rise up!
LAURA: Raise, rise up!

02:05:15.724 --> 02:05:18.024
Like 20-- oh god, actually--

02:05:18.024 --> 02:05:20.474
oh god, maybe I don't want to rise up.

02:05:20.474 --> 02:05:24.114
I'm going to rise up and stand up on the rooftop.

02:05:24.114 --> 02:05:26.975
Not the same one that Yasha is on, but the other one.

02:05:26.975 --> 02:05:27.808
This one.
TRAVIS: Why did you just

02:05:27.808 --> 02:05:30.040
spray laser on my table?

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.014
LAURA: Did I?

02:05:31.014 --> 02:05:33.352
SAM: I think it was a reflection.

02:05:33.352 --> 02:05:34.294
TRAVIS: (buzzing)

02:05:34.294 --> 02:05:36.841
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right, definitely got that.

02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:38.433
SAM: ♪ Bee bop a doo ♪

02:05:38.433 --> 02:05:39.913
ASHLEY and MATT: ♪ Bee bop a doo ♪

02:05:39.913 --> 02:05:41.194
ALL: ♪ Die die! ♪

02:05:41.194 --> 02:05:42.794
MATT: Okay.

02:05:42.794 --> 02:05:44.094
Does that finish your turn Jester?

02:05:44.094 --> 02:05:44.927
LAURA: Yes.

02:05:44.927 --> 02:05:46.303
MATT: All right, Essek's go.

02:05:50.236 --> 02:05:52.754
LIAM: (as George W. Bush) Could we see the whole square?

02:05:52.754 --> 02:05:56.494
SAM: (broad Texan accent) Could we see the whole square?

02:05:56.494 --> 02:05:57.327
Good.

02:05:59.345 --> 02:06:00.762
LAURA: Cool.

02:06:04.134 --> 02:06:07.117
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: Overwatch, can we see the whole square?

02:06:07.964 --> 02:06:11.088
MARISHA: Hitting it-- I can hear--
(cheering)

02:06:12.679 --> 02:06:14.842
(laughter)
MARISHA: "Yeah, yeah, blah blah blah blah"

02:06:14.842 --> 02:06:16.544
TALIESIN: So they're slow.

02:06:16.544 --> 02:06:18.744
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: They don't seem to move very far.

02:06:18.744 --> 02:06:20.000
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.143
MATT: In comparison to some other things.

02:06:21.143 --> 02:06:22.293
LAURA: So we could run away.

02:06:24.084 --> 02:06:25.524
TALIESIN: If we're in the mood for that.

02:06:25.524 --> 02:06:29.474
LAURA: But we just freed one and it felt happy.

02:06:29.474 --> 02:06:32.229
We must free every citizen of this city.

02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:33.943
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, by all means.

02:06:34.810 --> 02:06:36.276
Essek is going to go ahead and--

02:06:36.276 --> 02:06:38.464
TRAVIS: Is that what we're doing?

02:06:38.464 --> 02:06:42.987
MATT: -- drift down and glide above the ground here.

02:06:44.384 --> 02:06:47.609
As he drifts there, he brings his hands together

02:06:47.609 --> 02:06:50.594
into like gathering energy perspective.

02:06:50.594 --> 02:06:54.404
Full-on hadouken motion, like crackling energy.

02:06:54.404 --> 02:06:57.784
And then he one handed flings it forward

02:06:57.784 --> 02:07:01.304
and a bolt of black electricity

02:07:01.304 --> 02:07:04.424
arcs forward through to that one through that one

02:07:04.424 --> 02:07:07.534
and off about another 30 or 40 feet in that direction.

02:07:07.534 --> 02:07:11.524
Before you hear the crackle and slight boom of thunder

02:07:11.524 --> 02:07:16.274
in the space doing a Lightning Bolt against both of them.

02:07:19.154 --> 02:07:20.821
That's a great roll.

02:07:24.486 --> 02:07:25.319
Whew!

02:07:27.624 --> 02:07:31.954
36 points of damage.

02:07:31.954 --> 02:07:33.170
If they make their save or not.

02:07:33.170 --> 02:07:35.634
That guy fails.

02:07:35.634 --> 02:07:39.094
And that guy fails even lower.

02:07:39.094 --> 02:07:39.927
Okay.

02:07:40.802 --> 02:07:45.234
So that is 36 points of lightning damage there.

02:07:45.234 --> 02:07:49.564
And 36 points of lightning damage to him.

02:07:49.564 --> 02:07:53.164
That one's looking pretty torn up.

02:07:53.164 --> 02:07:54.234
All right.

02:07:54.234 --> 02:07:56.100
Essek withdraws and stays floating in that position

02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:58.354
and is going to go ahead and back up a bit

02:07:58.354 --> 02:08:00.004
Because he still has a little bit of movement left.

02:08:00.004 --> 02:08:04.084
Just also super high intelligence. Finishing Essek's go.

02:08:04.084 --> 02:08:05.344
It is now Caleb's.

02:08:06.284 --> 02:08:07.184
LIAM: Okay, I don't think

02:08:07.184 --> 02:08:08.874
that the oogity boogity that's right there

02:08:08.874 --> 02:08:09.714
is right on top of me.

02:08:09.714 --> 02:08:11.704
It looks like it's a bit of a distance.

02:08:11.704 --> 02:08:13.448
Hopefully it is.
MATT: Nope, it's within five feet of you.

02:08:13.448 --> 02:08:14.755
LIAM: Within five feet of me?
MATT: Yeah.

02:08:14.755 --> 02:08:17.254
LIAM: All right, then I'm just
going to pull out my cat's cradle

02:08:17.254 --> 02:08:21.734
and slam it into the stone and send streaks of fire

02:08:21.734 --> 02:08:25.284
with Widogast's Web of Fire towards
the three that are closest to me.

02:08:25.284 --> 02:08:26.404

02:08:31.935 --> 02:08:34.304
to get the one that's just laughing on the ground.

02:08:34.304 --> 02:08:35.137
MATT: Correct.

02:08:35.137 --> 02:08:39.484
LIAM: And one to streak diagonally past

02:08:39.484 --> 02:08:43.254
the one closest to me to get to the one on the far fountain.

02:08:43.254 --> 02:08:44.987

LIAM: Yeah.

02:14:04.864 --> 02:14:05.774
MARISHA: I didn't--

02:14:06.694 --> 02:14:08.014
ASHLEY: I think--

02:14:08.014 --> 02:14:08.847
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:14:08.847 --> 02:14:10.194
ASHLEY: This was long overdue,

02:14:10.194 --> 02:14:12.784
I practically killed you, this is not that bad.

02:14:12.784 --> 02:14:14.915
MARISHA: Well, I guess it's fair play, yeah.

02:14:14.915 --> 02:14:16.874
MATT: (laughs)

02:14:16.874 --> 02:14:18.568
All right, finishing Beau's turn.
SAM: Kill her, Yasha!

02:14:18.568 --> 02:14:19.609
MATT: Yasha, you're you're up.

02:14:19.609 --> 02:14:21.672
ASHLEY: Okay, so--
LIAM: (like Veth) She turned on us!

02:14:21.672 --> 02:14:23.759
TRAVIS: Way to go, Dark Beau!

02:14:23.759 --> 02:14:25.684
(laughter)

02:14:25.684 --> 02:14:28.394
ASHLEY: Also, because I rolled twice,

02:14:28.394 --> 02:14:32.227
because I thought my sword with the wisdom, but the--

02:14:33.377 --> 02:14:37.274
the first roll that I rolled was a 14 plus one

02:14:37.274 --> 02:14:39.084
so it brought me to 15.

02:14:39.084 --> 02:14:41.252
And then I also rolled a natural 20.

02:14:41.252 --> 02:14:42.684
MATT: Right, but you rolled with advantage

02:14:42.684 --> 02:14:43.754
when you weren't supposed to, right?

02:14:43.754 --> 02:14:46.354
ASHLEY: I know, the 20 was the advantage.

02:14:46.354 --> 02:14:48.020
MATT: To a total of 15?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:49.564
MATT: 15 is just what you needed.

02:14:49.564 --> 02:14:51.562
ASHLEY: Oh, okay.

02:14:51.562 --> 02:14:52.944
I just thought I had to be honest

02:14:52.944 --> 02:14:55.234
in case something happened.

02:14:55.234 --> 02:14:56.439
MATT: Yeah, because you rolled a 14 last time?

02:14:56.439 --> 02:14:58.047
MARISHA: I rolled a 14.
MATT: Yeah, you were just beneath.

02:14:58.047 --> 02:14:58.880
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:14:59.804 --> 02:15:03.264
All right, so what I'm going to do is,

02:15:03.264 --> 02:15:06.827
I'm going to push Beau with my finger on her forehead.

02:15:06.827 --> 02:15:07.857
(laughter)

02:15:07.857 --> 02:15:10.655
And then I'm going to walk to--

02:15:10.655 --> 02:15:11.964
LIAM: Her 10 strength.

02:15:11.964 --> 02:15:13.988
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk to--

02:15:13.988 --> 02:15:16.991
or float over to--

02:15:16.991 --> 02:15:18.366
LIAM: That was awesome.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:15:18.366 --> 02:15:19.561
ASHLEY: In front of me, yeah.

02:15:19.561 --> 02:15:20.510
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: "Move."

02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:21.343
MATT: So as you glide through the air

02:15:21.343 --> 02:15:23.885
towards this creature--
TALIESIN: Hey, we <i>all</i> float down here.

02:15:23.885 --> 02:15:25.314
SAM: That's true.

02:15:25.314 --> 02:15:26.514
ASHLEY: Take a swing.

02:15:26.514 --> 02:15:28.262
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:15:28.262 --> 02:15:30.273
MATT: Sword out.

02:15:30.273 --> 02:15:32.326
ASHLEY: (groans)

02:15:32.326 --> 02:15:33.159
TRAVIS: Say it!

02:15:33.159 --> 02:15:34.411
ASHLEY: Natural one.

02:15:34.411 --> 02:15:36.260
MATT: Fuck!
TRAVIS: That's the second one today.

02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:37.268
MARISHA: It is.

02:15:37.268 --> 02:15:38.126
ASHLEY: I'm going to put you--
TRAVIS: Get him out.

02:15:38.126 --> 02:15:39.771
LAURA: Oh yeah!
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15:39.771 --> 02:15:41.846
Okay. Okay.
TRAVIS: Ain't got time for that shit.

02:15:41.846 --> 02:15:43.651
SAM: Come on, Orphan Maker!

02:15:44.934 --> 02:15:45.776
ASHLEY: 22.

02:15:45.776 --> 02:15:48.034
MATT: 22 hits. The first strike you go and swing wide

02:15:48.034 --> 02:15:49.234
and it seems like it's cutting in,

02:15:49.234 --> 02:15:51.294
but instead, it's actually swallowing it.

02:15:51.294 --> 02:15:52.954
It's going into the mouth, the teeth are scraping

02:15:52.954 --> 02:15:54.244
on the blade and you pull out quickly

02:15:54.244 --> 02:15:56.294
and angrily do a second swipe and it does hit true.

02:15:56.294 --> 02:15:57.220
Go ahead and roll damage.

02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:58.493
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:15:58.493 --> 02:16:00.243
MATT: But since this is your
first hit, you still do full damage.

02:16:00.243 --> 02:16:01.076
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:16:05.434 --> 02:16:08.109
I'm going to try Savage Attacker.

02:16:11.534 --> 02:16:12.813
Oh yeah, that's way better.
LIAM: Were those dice that she had?

02:16:12.813 --> 02:16:14.273
SAM: Yeah, they--
LAURA: They're teeny teeny!

02:16:14.273 --> 02:16:16.756
LIAM: Like the size of teeth.
ASHLEY: I know, they're really small.

02:16:16.756 --> 02:16:19.392
I just like them because they're cute.
LAURA: They are so cute though.

02:16:19.392 --> 02:16:20.393
SAM: They're baby teeth!

02:16:20.393 --> 02:16:22.764
TRAVIS: They're real teeth.
ASHLEY: I feel like <i>you</i> got me those

02:16:22.764 --> 02:16:24.244
<i>way</i> back in the day.

02:16:24.244 --> 02:16:26.674
Anyway. Okay.
SAM: Are they Ronin's?

02:16:26.674 --> 02:16:28.167
LIAM: First teeth to fall out.

02:16:29.564 --> 02:16:31.574
LAURA: I did give her teeth dice, so that makes sense.

02:16:31.574 --> 02:16:33.264
ASHLEY: Oh, 36 again.

02:16:33.264 --> 02:16:34.097
MATT: That's great.

02:16:34.097 --> 02:16:35.384
ASHLEY: 36 points of damage.
SAM: 36?

02:16:35.384 --> 02:16:37.252
LAURA: Wow!
TRAVIS: In one hit? Fuck!

02:16:37.252 --> 02:16:41.304
MATT: You-- angrily your second swipe cleaves it in half

02:16:41.304 --> 02:16:44.564
and both sides-- (squelches)

02:16:44.564 --> 02:16:47.134
and slowly dissolve into the ground.

02:16:47.134 --> 02:16:47.984
It is destroyed.

02:16:47.984 --> 02:16:51.293
ASHLEY: I'm going to turn behind me just over my shoulder,

02:16:51.293 --> 02:16:53.902
(kiss) give her a kiss, blow her a kiss.

02:16:53.902 --> 02:16:55.554
SAM: The tentacle monster?

02:16:55.554 --> 02:16:56.594
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:16:56.594 --> 02:16:58.234
MATT: (laughs)

02:16:58.234 --> 02:16:59.924
MARISHA: Wait!
ASHLEY: Super into tentacles.

02:16:59.924 --> 02:17:01.932
MARISHA: Wait.
ASHLEY: Er, that probably--

02:17:01.932 --> 02:17:03.642
(laughter)

02:17:03.642 --> 02:17:05.709
Leave it, leave it. Move on.
MATT: Anyway!

02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:08.144
TRAVIS: You're in trouble now.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:17:08.144 --> 02:17:09.536
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no.

02:17:09.536 --> 02:17:11.204
TRAVIS: (rewind talking)

02:17:11.204 --> 02:17:12.834
ASHLEY: Who's next? I'm done.

02:17:12.834 --> 02:17:14.364
MARISHA: We'll explore later.
(laughter)

02:17:14.364 --> 02:17:16.974
MATT: It is now Veth's go, with Fjord on deck.

02:17:16.974 --> 02:17:18.504
SAM: Is there only one creature left?

02:17:18.504 --> 02:17:19.734
MATT: There's two of them.

02:17:19.734 --> 02:17:20.856
One is no longer laughing.

02:17:20.856 --> 02:17:22.834
It did save at the end of its last turn.

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.500
SAM: Oh. But it's prone?

02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:25.878
MATT: But it's prone still currently.

02:17:25.878 --> 02:17:28.006
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ Ooh, it's that Laffy Taffy! ♪

02:17:28.006 --> 02:17:30.404
SAM: Okay, I will float.

02:17:30.404 --> 02:17:32.984
By the way, just checking around this clock tower,

02:17:32.984 --> 02:17:35.251
there's nothing interesting in there?

02:17:36.334 --> 02:17:37.199
MATT: Inside? No.

02:17:37.199 --> 02:17:38.077
And it's not as much a clock tower-

02:17:38.077 --> 02:17:40.674
SAM: No silly imp holding a glowing thing or anything? No.

02:17:40.674 --> 02:17:42.701
MATT: Not on this floor, no, it's all pretty open.

02:17:42.701 --> 02:17:43.734
TRAVIS: A silly imp!

02:17:43.734 --> 02:17:48.734
SAM: I will then float out into the bough of the tree,

02:17:48.914 --> 02:17:51.707
the leaves of the tree.
TRAVIS and LIAM: Bow of a ship!

02:17:52.896 --> 02:17:56.320
SAM: And sort of, you know...

02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:58.261
make my way through the--
ASHLEY: ♪ Makin' my way! ♪

02:17:58.261 --> 02:17:59.736
SAM: -- tree leaves,

02:17:59.736 --> 02:18:02.214
hiding as I go with my bonus action.

02:18:02.214 --> 02:18:03.047
MATT: All righty.

02:18:04.374 --> 02:18:07.264
SAM: With another-- it's 27.

02:18:07.264 --> 02:18:09.062
MATT: You feel pretty well hidden within the leaves.

02:18:09.062 --> 02:18:12.664
SAM: I peek out of the leaves and I fire my crossbow

02:18:12.664 --> 02:18:15.584
at the one that I told the joke to.

02:18:15.584 --> 02:18:17.344
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: Hoping that they didn't see.

02:18:17.344 --> 02:18:19.674
MATT: Okay, you are hidden, so it's advantage on the strike.

02:18:19.674 --> 02:18:22.414
However, it is prone and ranged attacks

02:18:22.414 --> 02:18:25.074
against a prone creature are at disadvantage.

02:18:25.074 --> 02:18:26.524
So it's just a single hit.

02:18:26.524 --> 02:18:28.062
SAM: So it's not a sneak attack?

02:18:28.062 --> 02:18:28.934
MATT: No.

02:18:28.934 --> 02:18:30.779
SAM: Damn!

02:18:30.779 --> 02:18:32.458
I blew it, you guys.

02:18:32.458 --> 02:18:33.874
I blew it.

02:18:33.874 --> 02:18:35.834
And it was a bad roll, 17?

02:18:35.834 --> 02:18:37.142
MATT: 17 still hits, though.

02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:39.319
SAM: Ah, poopy doopies!

02:18:39.319 --> 02:18:40.794
MATT: (laughs)

02:18:42.414 --> 02:18:44.804
SAM: That is-- it's too late to do that,

02:18:44.804 --> 02:18:47.154
so, eight points of damage!
MARISHA: That was so cute!

02:18:47.154 --> 02:18:48.959
MATT: Eight points of damage to it.

02:18:48.959 --> 02:18:50.349
MARISHA: "Poopy doopies!"

02:18:50.349 --> 02:18:52.484
MATT: (whistles) It vanishes into it.

02:18:52.484 --> 02:18:53.614
You assume it hurt it,

02:18:53.614 --> 02:18:56.904
but now it's just like-- (squelches)

02:18:56.904 --> 02:18:59.984
getting itself prepared to rejoin the fray

02:18:59.984 --> 02:19:02.724
since it was distracted by the incredible cleverness

02:19:02.724 --> 02:19:04.557
of your previous jest.

02:19:05.474 --> 02:19:06.524
That finish your turn?

02:19:06.524 --> 02:19:07.394
SAM: That does.

02:19:07.394 --> 02:19:09.026
MATT: All right, finishing your go, Veth,

02:19:09.026 --> 02:19:10.284
Fjord, you're up.

02:19:10.284 --> 02:19:13.544
TRAVIS: I will send three Eldritch Blasts.

02:19:13.544 --> 02:19:16.284
I'll gravitate so I'm right above the fountain,

02:19:16.284 --> 02:19:17.844
just up in the center.

02:19:17.844 --> 02:19:20.334
And I will send the three

02:19:20.334 --> 02:19:23.134
right by the one that's near the bottom of your hand.

02:19:23.134 --> 02:19:25.524
MATT: Got it.
Oh god, oh god!

02:19:25.524 --> 02:19:27.774
TRAVIS: 27 for the first,

02:19:27.774 --> 02:19:30.044
27 for the second,

02:19:30.044 --> 02:19:31.764
and 28 for the third.

02:19:31.764 --> 02:19:33.737
Those were all stupid high rolls.

02:19:33.737 --> 02:19:34.903
MATT: Dang!

02:19:36.353 --> 02:19:38.057
LAURA: Why can't you roll like him?

02:19:38.057 --> 02:19:39.144
(laughter)

02:19:39.144 --> 02:19:40.552
TRAVIS: 14, wow.
TALIESIN: Burn!

02:19:40.552 --> 02:19:41.385
TRAVIS: 14, 28.

02:19:41.385 --> 02:19:43.657
SAM: I don't have those slender wrists.

02:19:43.657 --> 02:19:46.554
(laughter)

02:19:46.554 --> 02:19:49.454
TRAVIS: 31 points of force damage.

02:19:49.454 --> 02:19:52.214
MATT: Nice!
TRAVIS: (three impacts)

02:19:52.214 --> 02:19:53.054
MATT: Well done.

02:19:53.054 --> 02:19:54.324
That finishes your go.

02:19:54.324 --> 02:19:56.194
As you blast them with each of these,

02:19:56.194 --> 02:19:59.034
you see splatters of flesh and bone

02:19:59.034 --> 02:20:00.971
and other elements scattering off.

02:20:00.971 --> 02:20:03.431
It's keeping itself together,
but it's looking pretty hurt.

02:20:03.431 --> 02:20:04.264
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:20:04.264 --> 02:20:05.484
MATT: That finish your go?
TRAVIS: It does.

02:20:05.484 --> 02:20:07.576
MATT: All righty, it is now their turn.

02:20:11.234 --> 02:20:14.142
(squelching)

02:20:15.264 --> 02:20:17.592
Right to there, going to get into--

02:20:17.592 --> 02:20:19.224
uses its movement and action to get there,

02:20:19.224 --> 02:20:20.374
but that's all it does.

02:20:21.728 --> 02:20:26.034
MARISHA: I want our campaign to
just be all Ashley sound effects.

02:20:26.034 --> 02:20:28.344
(laughter)

02:20:28.344 --> 02:20:29.974
SAM: You should release a library.

02:20:29.974 --> 02:20:32.444
MATT: You could do an animated series audio pass

02:20:32.444 --> 02:20:34.342
where it's just Ashley doing all the M&amp;E.

02:20:34.342 --> 02:20:36.592
(laughter)

02:20:38.291 --> 02:20:41.922
ASHLEY: Is she eating soup or is it a wet creature?

02:20:42.964 --> 02:20:44.139
You don't know!

02:20:44.139 --> 02:20:46.667
MATT: The creature actually begins climbing up the tree.

02:20:46.667 --> 02:20:48.967
SAM: (screams)

02:20:48.967 --> 02:20:50.454
MARISHA: Uh-oh.
SAM: No!

02:20:50.454 --> 02:20:52.281
MATT: And joins you up into the branches.

02:20:52.281 --> 02:20:54.364
TRAVIS: (screams)

02:20:54.364 --> 02:20:56.349
SAM: Want to do some apple picking?

02:20:57.481 --> 02:21:00.031
MATT: (gibbering snarl)

02:21:00.031 --> 02:21:01.281
It takes its movement and action to get there

02:21:01.281 --> 02:21:03.084
so it can't do anything, but it is right next to you

02:21:03.084 --> 02:21:04.894
in the middle of the tree.

02:21:04.894 --> 02:21:06.524
All right, finishing their turns.

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:08.574
Jester, you're up.

02:21:08.574 --> 02:21:12.834
LAURA: I'm going to float forward through the sky

02:21:12.834 --> 02:21:15.811
to get closer to Veth.

02:21:15.811 --> 02:21:16.685
MATT: Over this way?

02:21:16.685 --> 02:21:18.218
LAURA: <i>Ja.</i>
MATT: Okay.

02:21:19.494 --> 02:21:20.644
LAURA: Probably halfway in between,

02:21:20.644 --> 02:21:22.241
I've got to get within 60 feet.

02:21:22.241 --> 02:21:23.074
MATT: Okay.

02:21:23.074 --> 02:21:25.514
We'll say about there-ish?

02:21:25.514 --> 02:21:26.694
LAURA: Yeah.

02:21:26.694 --> 02:21:30.194
I'm going to cast--

02:21:30.194 --> 02:21:32.354
MATT: What's your movement speed with flight?

02:21:32.354 --> 02:21:34.454
LAURA: Oh, 36.

02:21:34.454 --> 02:21:35.734
MATT: 36.

02:21:37.314 --> 02:21:40.391
MATT: Yeah, that's about as far as you can get there.

02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:42.854
LAURA: I'm going to assume their dexterity is low

02:21:42.854 --> 02:21:44.724
since they're so slow.

02:21:44.724 --> 02:21:47.494
And I'm going to try for Sacred Flame on it.

02:21:47.494 --> 02:21:48.327
MATT: Okay.

02:21:52.834 --> 02:21:53.994
Rolls a nine.

02:21:53.994 --> 02:21:55.354
LAURA: Sweet!

02:21:55.354 --> 02:21:56.581
SAM: Yeah!

02:21:56.581 --> 02:21:57.714
LAURA: (bro voice) Yes!

02:21:57.714 --> 02:21:59.247
(laughs) That was stupid.

02:21:59.247 --> 02:22:02.398
What a dumb movement.
LIAM: I'm amazing!

02:22:02.398 --> 02:22:03.814
LAURA: (bro voice) Yeah!

02:22:05.154 --> 02:22:06.097
Sweet!

02:22:08.161 --> 02:22:10.424
12 points of radiant damage.

02:22:10.424 --> 02:22:12.101
SAM: 12 points?!

02:22:14.118 --> 02:22:15.401
LAURA: (high-pitched) Woo!

02:22:15.401 --> 02:22:16.244
MATT: (whooshes)

02:22:16.244 --> 02:22:18.319
It flares in the trees and you see some of the branches

02:22:18.319 --> 02:22:21.374
actually get blasted off from the radiant power.

02:22:21.374 --> 02:22:24.471
You hear it screech. (screeches)

02:22:24.471 --> 02:22:26.204
LAURA: You know, I thought that one was more damaged

02:22:26.204 --> 02:22:27.747
than it was, forgot.

02:22:28.804 --> 02:22:30.556
Sorry about that, Veth.

02:22:30.556 --> 02:22:32.673
SAM: (screams)
LAURA: I was trying to help you.

02:22:32.673 --> 02:22:35.190
(laughter)

02:22:36.294 --> 02:22:38.232
That one was just laughing on the ground.

02:22:38.232 --> 02:22:39.416
MATT: (laughs)

02:22:39.416 --> 02:22:40.249
LAURA: Whoops!

02:22:40.249 --> 02:22:41.754
MATT: That's all right. Is that your turn?

02:22:41.754 --> 02:22:42.587
LAURA: Yep.

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:44.510
MATT: All right. Essek's go.

02:22:45.804 --> 02:22:47.804
Essek glides up,

02:22:47.804 --> 02:22:49.246
figures that they've got that one over there,

02:22:49.246 --> 02:22:51.224
is going to go ahead and join Jester

02:22:51.224 --> 02:22:53.082
over in this space.
LIAM: Glaze glide up!

02:22:53.082 --> 02:22:54.793
LAURA: Essek, do better,

02:22:54.793 --> 02:22:56.794
do better than me!

02:22:56.794 --> 02:23:01.017
MATT: He's going to go ahead and Fire Bolt that one.

02:23:03.314 --> 02:23:05.514
Wow, natural 19, yeah, that'll do it.

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:09.870
So that's 3d10.

LAURA: Should I have these?

02:23:17.115 --> 02:23:18.826
Or this?

02:23:18.826 --> 02:23:20.226

02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:33.394
MATT: So as you're screaming, Veth,

02:23:33.394 --> 02:23:34.994
the creature is reaching out.

02:23:34.994 --> 02:23:36.500
It's beginning to wrap around you

02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:38.274
and you can feel the teeth beginning to push,

02:23:38.274 --> 02:23:41.234
to burrow into your exposed arms.

02:23:41.234 --> 02:23:44.104
And as you pull back suddenly-- (roars)

02:23:44.104 --> 02:23:46.214
it catches fire and begins to screech

02:23:46.214 --> 02:23:47.504
this high-pitched screech,

02:23:47.504 --> 02:23:49.404
with multiple mouths around its body.

02:23:49.404 --> 02:23:51.284
It pulls away from you as you shove it off,

02:23:51.284 --> 02:23:53.454
and you watch as it begins to burn against the branch.

02:23:53.454 --> 02:23:55.464
And as it hits the branch and burns,

02:23:55.464 --> 02:23:56.564
instead of the branch blackening,

02:23:56.564 --> 02:23:58.808
the branch begins to move away from it.

02:23:58.808 --> 02:24:01.294
And you begin to see the bark on the tree itself,

02:24:01.294 --> 02:24:03.464
turn into flesh as that part of the branch

02:24:03.464 --> 02:24:05.814
begins to retract and form into the tree.

02:24:05.814 --> 02:24:08.384
Elements around you of the branches you can now see,

02:24:08.384 --> 02:24:12.374
elements of eyes peering through for a second.

02:24:12.374 --> 02:24:14.034
The tree itself also appears

02:24:14.034 --> 02:24:16.163
to be partially made of flesh.

02:24:16.163 --> 02:24:17.162
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:24:17.162 --> 02:24:18.374
SAM: Gross!

02:24:18.374 --> 02:24:20.314
Fleshy trees!

02:24:20.314 --> 02:24:22.064
MATT: But it is gone.

02:24:22.064 --> 02:24:23.791
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:24:23.791 --> 02:24:25.454
MATT: Essek looks up at you and goes,

02:24:25.454 --> 02:24:27.152
"There we go, teamwork!"

02:24:28.054 --> 02:24:28.887
LAURA: Good job!

02:24:28.887 --> 02:24:30.494
SAM: Thank you, Essek!

02:24:30.494 --> 02:24:33.113
MATT: With that, it brings us to Caleb's go.

02:24:33.113 --> 02:24:35.029
LAURA: I'm eating trail mix in the middle of the battle.

02:24:35.029 --> 02:24:37.280
LIAM: -- any baddies on the map from--
Oh, there, okay.

02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.744
MATT: There's one right there.
SAM: It's in-game.

02:24:38.744 --> 02:24:42.094
MATT: So Caleb watches Essek huck some fire

02:24:42.094 --> 02:24:44.184
and he just sort of smirks to himself

02:24:44.184 --> 02:24:46.364
and does the same and throws a Fire Bolt

02:24:46.364 --> 02:24:49.327
at the thing right below, messing with Beau.

02:24:49.327 --> 02:24:51.034
MATT: Go ahead and roll for an attack.

02:24:52.064 --> 02:24:53.069
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:24:53.069 --> 02:24:54.996
TRAVIS: Yo!
SAM: Woo!

02:24:54.996 --> 02:24:56.721
LIAM: Fire Bolt.

02:24:59.209 --> 02:25:04.209
LIAM: 14, 21, so a total of 42 points of fire damage.

02:25:04.594 --> 02:25:05.632
Because of crit.

02:25:05.632 --> 02:25:06.807
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:25:06.807 --> 02:25:08.565
SAM: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Yes!

02:25:10.519 --> 02:25:13.404
LIAM: I would let the Fire Bolt

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:14.774
hit it down at the bottom

02:25:14.774 --> 02:25:16.684
and it would just wreathe around

02:25:16.684 --> 02:25:18.114
and burn all the way to the top

02:25:18.114 --> 02:25:20.304
and it would just char and bubble,

02:25:20.304 --> 02:25:22.849
until it looked like fondue at Beau's feet.

02:25:23.964 --> 02:25:25.671
MATT: You watch as the flames consume it

02:25:25.671 --> 02:25:27.894
and it squeals and begins to liquefy.

02:25:27.894 --> 02:25:30.474
And as it begins to slowly expand

02:25:30.474 --> 02:25:32.314
and melt into the ground

02:25:32.314 --> 02:25:35.764
you see briefly a face left behind that just goes,

02:25:35.764 --> 02:25:37.584
"Thank you."

02:25:37.584 --> 02:25:42.584
And then sifts away and left behind is just,

02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:46.184
untouched, unscuffed, unmarked cobblestone.

02:25:46.184 --> 02:25:47.751
LIAM: Wow. That had this energy.

LAURA: Yeah, it did.

02:25:52.369 --> 02:25:53.584
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:25:53.584 --> 02:25:55.176
SAM: Do you have to still do your thing

02:25:55.176 --> 02:25:57.354
where you can go catatonic?

02:25:57.354 --> 02:25:58.934
LIAM: Was that a person?

02:25:58.934 --> 02:25:59.767
SAM: Oh, I don't know.

02:25:59.767 --> 02:26:01.491
TRAVIS: We probably can't stay here very long.

02:26:01.491 --> 02:26:03.296
TALIESIN: I think we should go.

02:26:04.444 --> 02:26:05.379
LAURA: We should go.

02:26:05.379 --> 02:26:06.964
TALIESIN: I don't think it matters on a certain level

02:26:06.964 --> 02:26:09.714
where we go, but I think we need to not be here.

02:26:09.714 --> 02:26:11.554
LIAM: And it's just streets off

02:26:11.554 --> 02:26:13.124
in different directions, or are we--?

02:26:13.124 --> 02:26:14.904
MATT: From what you can see there's streets this way,

02:26:14.904 --> 02:26:16.814
this way, this way, this opening goes

02:26:16.814 --> 02:26:18.314
to two other streets that direction,

02:26:18.314 --> 02:26:20.804
what you have right now in the middle of this intersection

02:26:20.804 --> 02:26:23.324
that catches any eye is what you see on this battlefield.

02:26:23.324 --> 02:26:25.454
LIAM: We have no idea where.

02:26:25.454 --> 02:26:27.104
MATT: You saw them disappear into this space,

02:26:27.104 --> 02:26:28.254
but you're not sure where.

02:26:28.254 --> 02:26:29.854
MARISHA: Also, keep in mind that the city

02:26:29.854 --> 02:26:31.084
has been repeating itself,

02:26:31.084 --> 02:26:33.094
at least from what we've noticed.

02:26:33.094 --> 02:26:36.224
So there's probably a true center to the city

02:26:36.224 --> 02:26:41.165
and then faker recreations of it, if that makes sense.

02:26:41.165 --> 02:26:43.081
TRAVIS: Copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.
LAURA: That makes sense.

02:26:43.081 --> 02:26:46.554
SAM: I'm going to run over to just quickly inspect

02:26:46.554 --> 02:26:48.174
some of the crates or boxes,

02:26:48.174 --> 02:26:50.844
or barrels around to see if, are they props?

02:26:50.844 --> 02:26:52.124
Are they facades?

02:26:52.124 --> 02:26:54.202
Are they full of actual items?

02:26:54.202 --> 02:26:55.177
LAURA: Are they flesh?

02:26:55.177 --> 02:26:57.124
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. If you cut into it, is it cake?

02:26:57.124 --> 02:26:58.735
TALIESIN: I want to look inside a building.

02:26:58.735 --> 02:27:00.134
TRAVIS: Cake would be okay.

02:27:00.134 --> 02:27:02.524
MATT: You glance inside the building

02:27:02.524 --> 02:27:07.414
and you see what at first glance is furniture.

02:27:07.414 --> 02:27:11.404
But a lot of it seems halfway apparated.

02:27:11.404 --> 02:27:15.937
The table seems like it's sagging.

02:27:16.784 --> 02:27:21.784
And elements of it are corporating partially.

02:27:22.644 --> 02:27:27.097
The door itself is folded over, like the Doldrums.

02:27:28.774 --> 02:27:33.404
Everything is slightly drifting

02:27:33.404 --> 02:27:35.494
and you can see the coloration changing

02:27:35.494 --> 02:27:37.154
into different skin tones.

02:27:37.154 --> 02:27:40.314
TALIESIN: The interiors apparently are lazy.

02:27:40.314 --> 02:27:42.234
I'm going to back off.

02:27:42.234 --> 02:27:44.524
MATT: Roll an investigation check, if you'd like.

02:27:45.737 --> 02:27:46.570
SAM: Oh!

02:27:50.597 --> 02:27:51.794
29.

02:27:51.794 --> 02:27:52.734
MATT: 29.

02:27:52.734 --> 02:27:53.884
As you go over towards the crates,

02:27:53.884 --> 02:27:57.094
you open them up and you see there are items

02:27:57.094 --> 02:28:01.689
and supplies and tools and things in the crates.

02:28:02.684 --> 02:28:04.794
SAM: Can I pick something up?

02:28:04.794 --> 02:28:06.624
MATT: You grab it and it retracts.

02:28:06.624 --> 02:28:07.924
SAM: Oh!

02:28:07.924 --> 02:28:09.040
LAURA: Gross.

02:28:12.608 --> 02:28:14.477
MARISHA: That's terrifying.

02:28:14.477 --> 02:28:17.054
SAM: It's all fingers--

02:28:17.054 --> 02:28:19.120
MARISHA: Oof, oh!

02:28:20.406 --> 02:28:21.882
Could you imagine if you tried to grab a fork?
LAURA: Try petting it.

02:28:21.882 --> 02:28:23.864
See what happens if you pet it.

02:28:23.864 --> 02:28:27.198
SAM: Okay, I'll find a pair of pliers and pet them.

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:29.924
MATT: (laughs)

02:28:29.924 --> 02:28:30.789
I'll stroke the pliers.

02:28:30.789 --> 02:28:31.622
LAURA: You should ask first.
TRAVIS: It's like that textbook

02:28:31.622 --> 02:28:33.344
in Harry Potter, you've got to stroke the spine.

02:28:33.344 --> 02:28:34.177
LAURA: Always ask first.

02:28:34.177 --> 02:28:37.914
SAM: May I stroke you, pliers?

02:28:38.984 --> 02:28:41.264
MATT: You do not get a response from the pliers.

02:28:41.264 --> 02:28:43.074
SAM: I take that as a yes.

02:28:43.074 --> 02:28:44.484
(laughter)

02:28:44.484 --> 02:28:45.317
No?

02:28:46.624 --> 02:28:49.649
TRAVIS: I don't know if Henry Crabgrass
would agree with that.

02:28:49.649 --> 02:28:52.344
MARISHA: Henry Crabgrass would say that's a no, but--

02:28:52.344 --> 02:28:53.254
SAM: Okay.

02:28:53.254 --> 02:28:55.006
All right, well then, I'll leave it alone.

02:28:55.006 --> 02:28:57.444
(laughter)

02:28:57.444 --> 02:29:01.919
TRAVIS: The living city in the Astral Sea
applies to the Henry Crabgrass paradigm.

02:29:01.919 --> 02:29:02.952
SAM: That was best, I don't want to--

02:29:02.952 --> 02:29:05.162
MATT: Universal rule.
SAM: -- overstep.

02:29:05.162 --> 02:29:07.897
TALIESIN: I legitimately think there's nothing here for us.

02:29:08.944 --> 02:29:09.777
LAURA: Yeah.

02:29:09.777 --> 02:29:10.664
MARISHA: I do want to go over

02:29:10.664 --> 02:29:12.314
and do what we were originally doing

02:29:12.314 --> 02:29:15.054
which is investigating this fountain and this bird

02:29:15.054 --> 02:29:16.704
and I just want to see if there's a lever,

02:29:16.704 --> 02:29:19.074
or a device, or some sort of something

02:29:19.074 --> 02:29:21.654
because it feels so central.

02:29:21.654 --> 02:29:22.694
MATT: Okay.

02:29:22.694 --> 02:29:24.704
So you're inspecting which?

02:29:24.704 --> 02:29:27.744
MARISHA: The fountain area.

02:29:27.744 --> 02:29:29.244
MATT: Okay, roll an investigation check.
MARISHA: And I want to

02:29:29.244 --> 02:29:33.554
see if there's a lever, button, et cetera.

02:29:35.194 --> 02:29:37.704
It's sort of cocked.

02:29:37.704 --> 02:29:39.179
It's half-cocked.

02:29:40.884 --> 02:29:43.275
MATT: Can you read it?
Can you read a primary number?

02:29:43.275 --> 02:29:44.769
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Then it's not cocked.

02:29:44.769 --> 02:29:45.969
MARISHA: Then it's not cocked?

02:29:45.969 --> 02:29:48.224
It's an okay roll, though.

02:29:48.224 --> 02:29:49.664
Wait, what was it, investigation?

02:29:49.664 --> 02:29:51.467
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: I'm very good at this!

02:29:52.304 --> 02:29:53.462
30 total.

02:29:54.334 --> 02:29:55.484
MATT: All righty.

02:29:56.584 --> 02:29:58.684
Inspecting the fountain,

02:29:58.684 --> 02:30:01.454
there is no water present in it.

02:30:01.454 --> 02:30:05.174
And looking beneath, the somewhat marble texture

02:30:05.174 --> 02:30:07.284
of the outside begins to darken a bit

02:30:07.284 --> 02:30:11.694
to a purple-ish red on the base
of where the water basin would be.

02:30:11.694 --> 02:30:13.634
And looking down, you can see portions of it

02:30:13.634 --> 02:30:16.327
are slightly undulating.

02:30:19.974 --> 02:30:21.404
MARISHA: But I can't see the bottom?

02:30:21.404 --> 02:30:23.321
MATT: You can see the bottom.
MARISHA: I <i>can</i> see the bottom, okay.

02:30:23.321 --> 02:30:26.764
MATT: But you do not find any sort of switches or buttons,

02:30:26.764 --> 02:30:27.597
this appears to be--

02:30:27.597 --> 02:30:31.734
MARISHA: But it's moving because
it's probably also flesh, right?

02:30:31.734 --> 02:30:33.164
It's because it's flesh.

02:30:33.164 --> 02:30:33.997
TALIESIN: Everything is flesh.

02:30:33.997 --> 02:30:37.224
LIAM: It's trying to give its approximation of water.

02:30:37.224 --> 02:30:38.194
MARISHA: Water.

02:30:38.194 --> 02:30:40.044
LAURA: So I have a question.
TALIESIN: It's a memory.

02:30:40.044 --> 02:30:42.094
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: If--

02:30:42.094 --> 02:30:43.144
LAURA: Well, I have two questions.

02:30:43.144 --> 02:30:45.701
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: One for DM Matt.

02:30:45.701 --> 02:30:49.114
LAURA: Residuum, can that replace any component you need

02:30:49.114 --> 02:30:51.527
for a spell, or just monetary value?

02:30:52.524 --> 02:30:55.224
MATT: It's generally used to replace a component

02:30:57.384 --> 02:30:59.454
that is consumed.

02:30:59.454 --> 02:31:00.287
LAURA: Okay.

02:31:00.287 --> 02:31:02.244
MATT: Because you can use an arcane focus

02:31:02.244 --> 02:31:04.474
which would be like a holy symbol that you carry,

02:31:04.474 --> 02:31:08.464
to replace any non-monetary based components.

02:31:08.464 --> 02:31:09.522
LAURA: Right.

02:31:10.884 --> 02:31:12.274
With Find the Path.

02:31:12.274 --> 02:31:13.804
MATT: Correct.

02:31:13.804 --> 02:31:16.844
LAURA: It needs a component that isn't monetary,

02:31:16.844 --> 02:31:17.874
but it's not a focus.

02:31:17.874 --> 02:31:20.024
MATT: I see. No, it does not replace things

02:31:20.024 --> 02:31:22.394
that require specific locational things.

02:31:22.394 --> 02:31:23.664
It wouldn't replace a rod that you need

02:31:23.664 --> 02:31:26.634
to cast Planar Travel or anything.

02:31:26.634 --> 02:31:28.094
LAURA: My second question is,

02:31:28.094 --> 02:31:30.307
this whole city is made of flesh.

02:31:31.304 --> 02:31:34.194
So technically everything is the same thing, right?

02:31:34.194 --> 02:31:35.690
TALIESIN: More or less, I think.

02:31:36.764 --> 02:31:40.436
LAURA: So if we need something from a certain location.

02:31:40.436 --> 02:31:41.584
MARISHA: Mm.

02:31:44.084 --> 02:31:45.014
LAURA: How does that work?

02:31:45.014 --> 02:31:46.604
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:31:46.604 --> 02:31:51.604
SAM: You're saying you have an item from a place?

02:31:51.924 --> 02:31:53.754
LAURA: Well, if we're trying to find the place

02:31:53.754 --> 02:31:56.604
with the threshold crests,

02:31:56.604 --> 02:31:58.662
we're trying to find the--

02:32:00.012 --> 02:32:01.695
what was it called?

02:32:01.695 --> 02:32:03.697
LIAM: The Aether Crux.
LAURA: The Aether Crux?

02:32:05.294 --> 02:32:10.098
SAM: We don't have an item though, we just have a body.

02:32:10.098 --> 02:32:11.624
LAURA: I mean, I could cut off a branch from the tree,

02:32:11.624 --> 02:32:13.664
it's all the same thing, it's all the same creature.

02:32:13.664 --> 02:32:15.674
TALIESIN: Earth is the same earth. It doesn't matter.

02:32:15.674 --> 02:32:17.654
It's just where it has to come from.

02:32:17.654 --> 02:32:21.414
It's spatial, not chemical.

02:32:21.414 --> 02:32:23.004
LAURA: Okay.

02:32:23.004 --> 02:32:25.424
TALIESIN: We need allies.

02:32:25.424 --> 02:32:26.694
We need to find--

02:32:31.024 --> 02:32:32.494
SAM: Well, we might be able to turn

02:32:32.494 --> 02:32:37.494
some of these Somnovem against each other, right?

02:32:37.874 --> 02:32:38.707
We know some of their names.

02:32:38.707 --> 02:32:41.544
LAURA: Seems like already against each other.

02:32:41.544 --> 02:32:43.354
MARISHA: I'm wondering if we can just find

02:32:43.354 --> 02:32:47.814
a couple that have interests that align with us.

02:32:47.814 --> 02:32:52.755
TRAVIS: It seems like Ira, Mirumus,

02:32:53.889 --> 02:32:55.964
Gaudius,

02:32:57.124 --> 02:32:58.304
all seem to be--

02:32:58.304 --> 02:32:59.542
SAM: Excellent note taking.

02:32:59.542 --> 02:33:00.767
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:33:01.712 --> 02:33:04.234
TALIESIN: Laxtus, was that--?
LAURA: Ira was the aggressive one.

02:33:04.234 --> 02:33:06.794
MARISHA: Yeah, Ira's--
LAURA: Timorei was the one

02:33:06.794 --> 02:33:07.894
that was sneaky.

02:33:07.894 --> 02:33:09.584
MARISHA: And super terrified.

02:33:09.584 --> 02:33:11.574
LIAM: Scared.
TALIESIN: I wrote him as fear.

02:33:11.574 --> 02:33:13.334
I had wrath and fear.

02:33:13.334 --> 02:33:14.214
LIAM: Same.

02:33:14.214 --> 02:33:15.072
LAURA: Oh!

02:33:15.072 --> 02:33:16.868
MARISHA: Yeah, it's starting to very much be

02:33:16.868 --> 02:33:19.014
their personality traits.

02:33:19.014 --> 02:33:22.774
TALIESIN: I mean, you put a city of people together

02:33:22.774 --> 02:33:24.094
and put them into one mind,

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:25.944
of course they're not going to agree.

02:33:26.884 --> 02:33:28.197
We have nine--

02:33:29.064 --> 02:33:32.164
We have nine interests.

02:33:32.164 --> 02:33:33.831
TRAVIS: Emotions?
TALIESIN: Nine fiefdoms.

02:33:33.831 --> 02:33:36.724
LIAM: Distorted beyond all recognition.

02:33:36.724 --> 02:33:37.814
TALIESIN: Fighting.

02:33:37.814 --> 02:33:41.205
MARISHA: So if they are approximations,

02:33:41.205 --> 02:33:45.934
or divided emotions.

02:33:45.934 --> 02:33:47.134
TALIESIN: Conflicting.

02:33:47.993 --> 02:33:49.816
MARISHA: Maybe we just need to find

02:33:51.824 --> 02:33:52.994
the right emotion.

02:33:52.994 --> 02:33:55.634
TALIESIN: Clearly they want out.

02:33:55.634 --> 02:33:57.844
Clearly somebody wants out of this.

02:33:57.844 --> 02:33:59.014
MARISHA: Well, yeah.

02:33:59.014 --> 02:34:00.434
TRAVIS: Some do, some don't.

02:34:00.434 --> 02:34:01.824
TALIESIN: We've got to just find--

02:34:03.254 --> 02:34:08.200
LIAM: Well, the one that I spoke to said that

02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:11.454
Gaudius wanted oblivion.

02:34:11.454 --> 02:34:14.974
That seems different than returning home.

02:34:14.974 --> 02:34:18.439
Maybe that's our ally.

02:34:18.439 --> 02:34:20.639
TALIESIN: That's a gift I would happily give.

02:34:23.104 --> 02:34:24.374
MARISHA: And then--
LIAM: One of them wants

02:34:24.374 --> 02:34:25.654
all of this destroyed

02:34:25.654 --> 02:34:29.254
and wants release instead of a return to power

02:34:29.254 --> 02:34:33.022
or a return to our home.

02:34:35.274 --> 02:34:36.214
Oh boy.

02:34:36.214 --> 02:34:37.494
TRAVIS: We should walk and talk.

02:34:37.494 --> 02:34:39.234
At least change our position.

02:34:39.234 --> 02:34:42.234
LAURA: I don't even know where we're walking to.
SAM: What direction?

02:34:42.234 --> 02:34:45.244
LAURA: We can float up, I mean we could get off the surface

02:34:45.244 --> 02:34:47.864
and float above it.
MARISHA: I think that's a good idea.

02:34:47.864 --> 02:34:51.457
SAM: We could also go in one of these buildings and rest.

02:34:52.464 --> 02:34:55.324
LAURA: All the while Lucien is finding his way to--

02:34:55.324 --> 02:34:57.064
SAM: How do we find Lucien, though?

02:34:57.064 --> 02:35:00.994
LAURA: They said he was invisible, they couldn't see him.

02:35:00.994 --> 02:35:03.124
They saw Cree, but they couldn't see Lucien.

02:35:03.124 --> 02:35:04.274
TALIESIN: I bet they can't see us.

02:35:04.274 --> 02:35:06.694
SAM: They said they could see Cree?

02:35:06.694 --> 02:35:08.885
LAURA: Yeah, they said they could see his second.

02:35:08.885 --> 02:35:10.114
MARISHA: But that they couldn't see the Nonagon.

02:35:10.114 --> 02:35:11.894
TRAVIS: That's because Cree came this way

02:35:11.894 --> 02:35:13.462
and Lucien went the other.

02:35:13.462 --> 02:35:15.184
LAURA: Maybe.

02:35:15.184 --> 02:35:18.584
I imagine they'd be able to see everything in the city.

02:35:18.584 --> 02:35:19.879
MARISHA: That's what I would think too, but--

02:35:19.879 --> 02:35:22.427
LIAM: I don't know, if it's one big hive mind.

02:35:23.474 --> 02:35:25.179
MARISHA: Well, if it's a hive mind,

02:35:25.179 --> 02:35:26.924
it still might depend on where there are eyes.

02:35:26.924 --> 02:35:28.907
TRAVIS: Yeah, why would they ask us who we talked to?

02:35:28.907 --> 02:35:30.829
TALIESIN: It's nine big hive minds.

02:35:32.034 --> 02:35:33.524
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a point, they didn't know

02:35:33.524 --> 02:35:34.357
who we were talking to.

02:35:34.357 --> 02:35:35.764
TRAVIS: We should move. At least up.

02:35:35.764 --> 02:35:37.637
TALIESIN: We are moving, yeah.
LAURA: We're floating.

02:35:37.637 --> 02:35:39.704
TRAVIS: We all drift up off the ground.
MATT: Okay.

02:35:39.704 --> 02:35:41.401
You drift up and peer over the space

02:35:41.401 --> 02:35:43.664
and you can see where the streets go out

02:35:43.664 --> 02:35:48.664
and beneath you is the center

02:35:48.924 --> 02:35:51.844
where you have been glancing about

02:35:51.844 --> 02:35:54.874
and had this encounter with a few entities.

02:35:54.874 --> 02:35:56.214
MARISHA: And--

02:35:56.214 --> 02:35:57.824
MATT: From where you stand, looking around,

02:35:57.824 --> 02:36:02.824
any streets that they may have ducked through,

02:36:03.164 --> 02:36:04.927
you would've had visibility.

02:36:06.184 --> 02:36:08.819
LAURA: Hmm. Maybe it's <i>that</i> building.

02:36:10.114 --> 02:36:13.175
What's that one? Did we go in the house?

02:36:13.175 --> 02:36:14.334
MARISHA: Do we want to do a quick scan

02:36:14.334 --> 02:36:16.114
of these houses?
TALIESIN: Let's just check them all.

02:36:16.114 --> 02:36:17.584
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah.

02:36:17.584 --> 02:36:19.114
LIAM: Do you want to fan out in pairs?

02:36:19.114 --> 02:36:20.594
MARISHA: Sure.

02:36:20.594 --> 02:36:22.204
TALIESIN: What do we do if we find something?

02:36:22.204 --> 02:36:23.307
TRAVIS: Scream like a bitch.

02:36:23.307 --> 02:36:24.338
MARISHA: Yep.

02:36:24.338 --> 02:36:26.826
Yasha and I will take this--

02:36:28.684 --> 02:36:30.294
Whoops, wrong end.

02:36:30.294 --> 02:36:32.469
That was almost my eye!

02:36:34.024 --> 02:36:35.547
TALIESIN: Caleb, I'll stick with you just in case.

02:36:35.547 --> 02:36:37.194
MARISHA: Thank god I have three other eyes.

02:36:37.194 --> 02:36:38.484
We'll take this.

02:36:38.484 --> 02:36:39.694
MATT: Okay, so Yasha and Beau.

02:36:39.694 --> 02:36:40.724
MARISHA: This one, yes.

02:36:40.724 --> 02:36:42.644
MATT: All right.

02:36:42.644 --> 02:36:43.477
TRAVIS: Which one do you want?

02:36:43.477 --> 02:36:44.624
MATT: Who's taking what structures?

02:36:44.624 --> 02:36:45.562
TRAVIS: Do you want to take the little one

02:36:45.562 --> 02:36:46.395
on the corner over there?

02:36:46.395 --> 02:36:47.829
LAURA: Yeah, let's go look at the little one in the corner.

02:36:47.829 --> 02:36:50.067
TRAVIS: Jester and Fjord over here.
MATT: All right.

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:53.620
LIAM: Somebody guard our exchange student wizard.

02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:54.484
Essek.

02:36:54.484 --> 02:36:55.484
LAURA: Oh yeah.

02:36:57.104 --> 02:36:58.814
SAM: Is anyone searching the middle building?

02:36:58.814 --> 02:37:00.464
MATT: "I can go with you, if you prefer."

02:37:00.464 --> 02:37:01.793
SAM: Sure, come.

02:37:01.793 --> 02:37:04.244
MATT: All right, so Essek and Veth
will go into the middle building.

02:37:04.244 --> 02:37:06.234
ASHLEY: You already looked at the dome?

02:37:06.234 --> 02:37:08.244
SAM: I didn't really-- I mean, I saw the second floor,

02:37:08.244 --> 02:37:11.421
but not the bottom floor or the thing on top, really.

02:37:11.421 --> 02:37:13.184
I mean, I was up there,

02:37:13.184 --> 02:37:15.806
did it look like a weather vane?

02:37:15.806 --> 02:37:16.639
MATT: At the very top?

02:37:16.639 --> 02:37:19.964
It looked like it was a bronzed statue

02:37:19.964 --> 02:37:22.247
of various planes.

02:37:23.084 --> 02:37:24.947
Like a-- what's the word?

02:37:26.024 --> 02:37:27.554
TALIESIN: The rocket ride at--
LIAM: Astrolabe?

02:37:27.554 --> 02:37:28.459
TALIESIN: Astrolabe.

02:37:28.459 --> 02:37:31.144
MATT: Astrolabe, yeah, that kind of a vibe.

02:37:31.144 --> 02:37:32.247
And the secondary floor,

02:37:32.247 --> 02:37:34.824
you just dropped down real fast and looked in and darted out

02:37:34.824 --> 02:37:36.264
and there's the stairs that go down to the bottom floor,

02:37:36.264 --> 02:37:38.164
but you haven't really inspected the space.

02:37:38.164 --> 02:37:38.997
SAM: You can go check it out.

02:37:38.997 --> 02:37:40.671
LIAM: Fjord tough, you have See Invisibility

02:37:40.671 --> 02:37:42.153
up right now still, yeah?

02:37:42.153 --> 02:37:43.986
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

02:37:46.161 --> 02:37:48.174
TRAVIS: And nothing weird was--?

02:37:48.174 --> 02:37:49.137
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:37:49.137 --> 02:37:50.293
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:37:53.626 --> 02:37:54.478
15.

02:37:54.478 --> 02:37:55.554
MATT: 15?

02:37:55.554 --> 02:37:57.654
You comfortably feel like there's nothing...

02:37:58.504 --> 02:37:59.833
untoward directly around you.

02:37:59.833 --> 02:38:01.564
TRAVIS: Untoward.

02:38:01.564 --> 02:38:03.230
MATT: All right, so.
LIAM: All right, who's going where?

02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:05.454
MATT: Yasha and Beau are going in that one.

02:38:05.454 --> 02:38:07.561
Both of you make investigation checks, if you'd like.

02:38:07.561 --> 02:38:08.394
MARISHA: Awesome.

02:38:12.375 --> 02:38:13.276
23.

02:38:13.276 --> 02:38:14.664
SAM: Ooh!

02:38:14.664 --> 02:38:15.584
ASHLEY: 19.

02:38:15.584 --> 02:38:16.664
MATT: Nice.

02:38:16.664 --> 02:38:18.684
Glancing through,

02:38:18.684 --> 02:38:21.894
you enter and go for the stairs

02:38:21.894 --> 02:38:23.184
and as you begin to step up the stairs,

02:38:23.184 --> 02:38:26.097
they're doughy beneath your feet.

02:38:26.097 --> 02:38:29.014
And you glance up and the second floor looks unfinished

02:38:29.014 --> 02:38:32.934
and mostly like pale, un-sun-touched skin.

02:38:32.934 --> 02:38:35.014
You can see almost translucent veins

02:38:35.014 --> 02:38:36.994
beyond the skin's surface and you go,

02:38:36.994 --> 02:38:39.244
maybe this probably isn't the way to go.

02:38:39.244 --> 02:38:41.694
The house does not appear to unveil anything

02:38:41.694 --> 02:38:43.844
of particular interest to your path.

02:38:45.375 --> 02:38:47.772
ASHLEY: I want to go back out. I don't like this house.

02:38:47.772 --> 02:38:49.788
MATT: And it was Fjord and Jester going to this one?

02:38:49.788 --> 02:38:50.639
TRAVIS: We were going to the other one.

02:38:50.639 --> 02:38:51.472
MATT: Oh, this one over here, go ahead

02:38:51.472 --> 02:38:52.834
and roll investigation checks for me, please.

02:38:52.834 --> 02:38:54.674
LAURA: Can I give Fjord advantage?

02:38:54.674 --> 02:38:56.599
MATT: Sure, if you'd like to.
LAURA: I'm going to--

02:38:57.449 --> 02:38:59.457
The Traveler is with you, literally.

02:38:59.457 --> 02:39:01.105
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you, Sprinkle.

02:39:01.105 --> 02:39:03.064
SAM: "Kill me!"
MATT: (squeaks)

02:39:03.064 --> 02:39:04.834
TRAVIS: That's great, it's a 24.

02:39:04.834 --> 02:39:06.428
LAURA: Did you add a d4?

02:39:06.428 --> 02:39:07.344
Because I gave you Guidance,

02:39:07.344 --> 02:39:08.873
that's the whole point of me patting you.

02:39:08.873 --> 02:39:09.884
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, sorry, I rolled with advantage, 24 plus--

02:39:09.884 --> 02:39:13.392
MATT: Well, you can't give him Guidance and advantage.

02:39:13.392 --> 02:39:14.664
LAURA: I can't?
MATT: Pick one or the other.

02:39:14.664 --> 02:39:15.497
TRAVIS: 24 is pretty good.

02:39:15.497 --> 02:39:17.204
MATT: Because you're actively helping him with the thing,

02:39:17.204 --> 02:39:19.634
it's like stacking a thing onto a thing

02:39:19.634 --> 02:39:21.114
you're doing simultaneously.

02:39:21.114 --> 02:39:23.652
LAURA: I see. That makes sense.

02:39:23.652 --> 02:39:25.534
SAM: (chuckles)

02:39:25.534 --> 02:39:26.524
You took the advantage.

02:39:26.524 --> 02:39:28.984
TRAVIS: Don't look at <i>me</i> with the stink eye.

02:39:28.984 --> 02:39:30.650
MATT: So what was your first roll?
TRAVIS: 24.

02:39:30.650 --> 02:39:32.290
MATT: 24, pretty decent.

02:39:33.444 --> 02:39:36.334
SAM: She seems mad, but she really just has peanut crumbs

02:39:36.334 --> 02:39:38.125
all over her mouth.
LAURA: Yeah, I'm literally just trying

02:39:38.125 --> 02:39:39.790
to take food out my--
TRAVIS: Picking her teeth with her tongue.

02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:40.623
MATT: You step into this building

02:39:40.623 --> 02:39:42.571
and it is a two story building from the outside.

02:39:43.457 --> 02:39:46.754
When you step into the building,

02:39:46.754 --> 02:39:48.034
it is empty.

02:39:48.034 --> 02:39:49.633
There is no second floor above.

02:39:49.633 --> 02:39:51.454
It's almost like a facade.

02:39:51.454 --> 02:39:52.287
TRAVIS: A shell.

02:39:52.287 --> 02:39:53.814
MATT: A shell of a house.

02:39:53.814 --> 02:39:58.014
And on the floor where it would be carpet or hardwood

02:39:58.014 --> 02:39:59.964
or whatever the interior you'd expect,

02:39:59.964 --> 02:40:02.284
it's just this tongue material.

02:40:02.284 --> 02:40:03.694
LAURA: (heaves)

02:40:03.694 --> 02:40:07.224
MATT: You can see the texture of the little flesh,

02:40:07.224 --> 02:40:09.669
cilia-like buds all across it.

02:40:10.537 --> 02:40:11.667
TRAVIS: I have to-- I have to--

02:40:11.667 --> 02:40:13.690
LAURA: Me, too. I really want to touch it.

02:40:14.577 --> 02:40:15.410
MATT: It's pretty bouncy.

02:40:15.410 --> 02:40:16.824
LAURA: Yeah.

02:40:16.824 --> 02:40:19.367
I'm going to just reach down and pet it,

02:40:19.367 --> 02:40:20.720
and see what it feels like.

02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:22.277
TRAVIS: Hey, you're going to get spit on your hand.

02:40:22.277 --> 02:40:23.535
MATT: It is faintly damp.

02:40:23.535 --> 02:40:26.030
LAURA: Ugh, it's literally like a tongue!

02:40:26.030 --> 02:40:27.525
TRAVIS: (whooshing)

02:40:27.525 --> 02:40:31.027
LAURA: No, Fjord, don't do that.
It's going to call them here.

02:40:31.027 --> 02:40:32.237
MATT: Apologies for folks:

02:40:32.237 --> 02:40:34.267
The final arc of this story is very body horror heavy,

02:40:34.267 --> 02:40:35.722
if you haven't noticed already.

02:40:35.722 --> 02:40:37.287
(laughter)

02:40:37.287 --> 02:40:38.167
TRAVIS: Yeah, nothing on the ceiling,

02:40:38.167 --> 02:40:39.667
nothing that attracts the eye,

02:40:39.667 --> 02:40:42.645
anything like that besides this tongue shell of a house.

02:40:42.645 --> 02:40:46.707
MATT: No, but when you do see is a similar pale texture

02:40:46.707 --> 02:40:51.707
to the interior and (splort, splort splort)

02:40:52.097 --> 02:40:55.105
the dampness you felt was a saliva-like liquid

02:40:55.105 --> 02:40:57.505
the dampness you felt was a saliva-like liquid

02:40:57.505 --> 02:41:02.107
that is just slowly dripping from the ceiling in places.

02:41:02.107 --> 02:41:03.647
TRAVIS: Do we want to get a vial of this

02:41:03.647 --> 02:41:05.037
and give it to Veth or anything?

02:41:05.037 --> 02:41:06.127
LAURA: Oh yeah, good call.

02:41:06.127 --> 02:41:09.087
I'll take out one of my random vials

02:41:09.087 --> 02:41:11.137
and scoop up some of the spit.

02:41:11.137 --> 02:41:12.534
TRAVIS: What's it smell like?

02:41:12.534 --> 02:41:14.709
LAURA: Ew, I can't smell spit, that's so fucking gross.

02:41:14.709 --> 02:41:16.844
TRAVIS: Do it for science, do it for Veth!
LAURA: No, no, no.

02:41:16.844 --> 02:41:19.306
TRAVIS: I'll smell it. (sniffs)

02:41:20.448 --> 02:41:21.606
MATT: There's no scent.

02:41:21.606 --> 02:41:23.187
LAURA: Oh okay. Well, that's good, no scent.

02:41:23.187 --> 02:41:25.013
TRAVIS: Brush their teeth, okay.

02:41:26.537 --> 02:41:29.297
LAURA: The spit coming from the ceiling,

02:41:29.297 --> 02:41:31.354
is there a hole in the ceiling?

02:41:31.354 --> 02:41:32.857
MATT: You don't see where it's coming from.

02:41:32.857 --> 02:41:35.357
TRAVIS: Is there a little speed bag up there?

02:41:35.357 --> 02:41:39.932
MATT: There is no abode uvula, no. (laughs)

02:41:39.932 --> 02:41:42.590
MARISHA: Abode uvula.
TRAVIS: I think we're good to leave.

02:41:43.664 --> 02:41:44.722
MATT: All right, who's investigating which?

02:41:44.722 --> 02:41:45.877
So you and Essek are investigating--

02:41:45.877 --> 02:41:47.512
SAM: The middle--
MATT: Right there?

02:41:47.512 --> 02:41:49.267
SAM: The one with the bridge, yeah.

02:41:49.267 --> 02:41:52.115
MATT: Okay, each roll investigation separately.

02:41:53.437 --> 02:41:54.607
SAM: 28.

02:41:54.607 --> 02:41:55.799
MATT: Higher than him.

02:41:57.497 --> 02:42:00.697
This building has a little more structure to it.

02:42:00.697 --> 02:42:02.997
As you begin to peer in, you see what

02:42:02.997 --> 02:42:04.517
Caduceus had glanced in before

02:42:04.517 --> 02:42:07.507
and seen some of the furniture that is partially present,

02:42:07.507 --> 02:42:12.027
but Dali-esque melting

02:42:12.027 --> 02:42:13.857
at certain corners and where it is

02:42:13.857 --> 02:42:15.417
you can see the coloration begins to fade

02:42:15.417 --> 02:42:19.077
from the hardwoods and polished surfaces,

02:42:19.077 --> 02:42:21.957
to a general ruddy skin tone

02:42:21.957 --> 02:42:24.627
with occasional bits of teeth poking through,

02:42:24.627 --> 02:42:26.740
like an exposed gum.

02:42:27.757 --> 02:42:29.427
You can see stairs that progress upward.

02:42:29.427 --> 02:42:30.997
And as you make your way up,

02:42:30.997 --> 02:42:34.307
they are similarly soft under the feet.

02:42:34.307 --> 02:42:35.957
And getting into the second floor,

02:42:37.537 --> 02:42:40.500
there is a singular person

02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:42.980
sitting on a stool in the center.
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no.

02:42:43.817 --> 02:42:45.942
SAM: Like looking at the corner like in Blair Witch?

02:42:45.942 --> 02:42:48.607
MATT: No, currently just looking down at the knees.

02:42:48.607 --> 02:42:50.757
LIAM: Josh, tell us where you are!

02:42:52.077 --> 02:42:56.407
SAM: Um, hello, uh, sorry.

02:42:56.407 --> 02:43:00.088
Is this your, is this your domicile?

02:43:06.397 --> 02:43:07.377
MATT: (high-pitched screaming)

02:43:07.377 --> 02:43:11.007
Starts the same high-pitched scream

02:43:11.007 --> 02:43:13.627
in your direction and just holds.

02:43:13.627 --> 02:43:15.297
You all hear the scream.

02:43:15.297 --> 02:43:16.147
LAURA: We go running.

02:43:16.147 --> 02:43:18.666
TRAVIS: Screams like a bitch. I'm going to float my way up.

02:43:18.666 --> 02:43:19.990
LAURA: Oh yeah.

02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:22.777
MATT: It's just staring at you screaming, and screaming,

02:43:22.777 --> 02:43:25.447
and screaming, and screaming, and screaming,

02:43:25.447 --> 02:43:27.837
and screaming, and screaming, and screaming.

02:43:27.837 --> 02:43:29.193
And Essek's like--

02:43:30.931 --> 02:43:33.149
SAM: I-- Yeah. I--

02:43:33.149 --> 02:43:36.327
MATT: (whooshes) He flings a finger forward and you watch

02:43:36.327 --> 02:43:39.607
as a bolt of flame hits and it ignites

02:43:39.607 --> 02:43:43.077
and the screaming slowly withers as it burns away--

02:43:44.767 --> 02:43:47.152
And it's gone and the screaming stops.

02:43:47.152 --> 02:43:48.343
TRAVIS: (relieved sigh)

02:43:49.407 --> 02:43:51.340
Still arrive in the window, hah!

02:43:52.443 --> 02:43:53.797
Was that you? Essek?

02:43:53.797 --> 02:43:56.517
SAM: Essek was protecting me.

02:43:56.517 --> 02:43:57.483
TRAVIS: From what?

02:43:58.507 --> 02:44:00.657
MATT: "Another one of the strange denizens here."

02:44:01.817 --> 02:44:03.907
TRAVIS: The ones with the flapping tendrils and teeth?

02:44:03.907 --> 02:44:07.020
MATT: "Not yet, we beat it to the punch.

02:44:08.187 --> 02:44:12.312
"Best not to be leaving alarms
here and there as we go, yes?"

02:44:12.312 --> 02:44:15.320
TRAVIS: Very well. Carry on.

02:44:16.967 --> 02:44:18.897
SAM: Is there more to investigate in here?

02:44:18.897 --> 02:44:22.090
MATT: No, it's pretty blank beyond that individual.

02:44:23.537 --> 02:44:25.997
SAM: All right, meet everybody else back outside.

02:44:25.997 --> 02:44:27.155
MATT: Right, who else is--

02:44:27.155 --> 02:44:29.195
LIAM: So that's the bridge to the buildings.

02:44:29.195 --> 02:44:30.803
TALIESIN: It's just us in that last little cabin.

02:44:30.803 --> 02:44:33.387
LIAM: And the red roof has been taken care of.

02:44:33.387 --> 02:44:34.307
So the last cabin.

02:44:34.307 --> 02:44:37.846
Well, there's also the bottom of the gazebo.

02:44:37.846 --> 02:44:41.157
And then there's two strange statues on this side,

02:44:41.157 --> 02:44:43.207
but let's try the house.

02:44:43.207 --> 02:44:45.137
MATT: Okay, investigation checks from both of you.

02:44:45.137 --> 02:44:46.731
TALIESIN: You can have my advantage.

02:44:46.731 --> 02:44:47.564
LIAM: Thank you.

02:44:47.564 --> 02:44:48.655
LAURA: And you looked at the bottom of the fountain, Beau?

02:44:48.655 --> 02:44:53.537
LAURA: And you looked at the bottom of the fountain, Beau?

02:44:53.537 --> 02:44:54.777
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:54.777 --> 02:44:55.610
LIAM: 26.

02:44:55.610 --> 02:44:59.580
MARISHA: I got like a 23 and just water, I don't know.

02:45:00.857 --> 02:45:04.882
MATT: This chamber in particular, the room is half--

02:45:06.007 --> 02:45:07.657
half there. You expect, with the walls,

02:45:07.657 --> 02:45:09.137
to be an open space but you go inside

02:45:09.137 --> 02:45:11.177
and it's only about half the size of the room.

02:45:11.177 --> 02:45:12.837
And for the wall, it seems like

02:45:12.837 --> 02:45:14.807
one of the walls has swollen outward a bit,

02:45:14.807 --> 02:45:16.367
and you can see textures of stone,

02:45:16.367 --> 02:45:19.190
but it's bowing in places and bulging in others.

02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:22.847
It's a very nightmare-esque experience

02:45:22.847 --> 02:45:25.337
of seeing something flat begin to push against

02:45:25.337 --> 02:45:27.730
its own normal flatness.

02:45:28.797 --> 02:45:31.267
As you walk past it,

02:45:31.267 --> 02:45:34.097
you see a hand push through the skin and move

02:45:34.097 --> 02:45:35.845
before pulling back in.

02:45:37.717 --> 02:45:39.547
You go and begin to make your way up the steps

02:45:39.547 --> 02:45:42.797
and the steps just continue upward. There's no second floor,

02:45:42.797 --> 02:45:46.200
until they hit a ceiling and there's no door above.

02:45:47.197 --> 02:45:50.907
It's a nonsensical, non-Euclidean stairway.

02:45:50.907 --> 02:45:53.643
LIAM: It's like a body horror, Warner Brothers lot.

02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:55.118
TALIESIN: Just for fun,

02:45:55.997 --> 02:45:59.487
I'm going to tap where the second floor would be.

02:45:59.487 --> 02:46:00.603
MATT: You tap it?

02:46:03.327 --> 02:46:05.847
The flesh opens up and there's teeth around it,

02:46:05.847 --> 02:46:10.277
about a six-foot wide hole, like an open mouth

02:46:10.277 --> 02:46:13.197
rimmed around with jagged teeth.

02:46:13.197 --> 02:46:15.417
And it opens to the roof.

02:46:16.907 --> 02:46:19.897
The stairs continue to like (squishing)

02:46:19.897 --> 02:46:21.230
appear and lead upward.

02:46:22.717 --> 02:46:26.123
TALIESIN: I thought so. All right, I'm heading up.

02:46:29.217 --> 02:46:30.197
MATT: You head up and you are now

02:46:30.197 --> 02:46:32.120
on the roof of that building there.

02:46:35.934 --> 02:46:37.527
LAURA: Floating in the air.

02:46:37.527 --> 02:46:39.756
Did you find anything?

02:46:39.756 --> 02:46:41.198
TALIESIN: I'm learning a lot.

02:46:42.597 --> 02:46:46.307
I'm going to-- are you behind me?

02:46:46.307 --> 02:46:47.957
LIAM: Yeah.

02:46:47.957 --> 02:46:50.607
TALIESIN: I'm going to float out the window

02:46:50.607 --> 02:46:55.607
and brush against the window

02:46:56.107 --> 02:46:57.907
stone as we're going.

02:46:57.907 --> 02:47:01.054
MATT: Okay, you touch it and it's weirdly warm to the touch,

02:47:01.054 --> 02:47:03.229
and it does give a bit with a bit of pressure.

02:47:03.229 --> 02:47:06.037
TALIESIN: I cast Decompose as I pass by.

02:47:06.037 --> 02:47:08.277
MATT: You watch as, in that space,

02:47:08.277 --> 02:47:10.807
the flesh begins to like quiver and twitch,

02:47:10.807 --> 02:47:14.127
and where does elements of it begin to gray.

02:47:14.127 --> 02:47:17.057
I know, I got it right. (laughs)

02:47:17.057 --> 02:47:21.537
It's always a bit dicey for a moment, but I pushed through.

02:47:21.537 --> 02:47:23.104
MARISHA: Watch as I twitch!

02:47:26.227 --> 02:47:28.307
MATT: But the skin begins to gray

02:47:28.307 --> 02:47:31.597
and behind you can see fungus beginning to build,

02:47:31.597 --> 02:47:35.137
and lichen and other elements of decomposition

02:47:35.137 --> 02:47:36.517
begin to take hold.

02:47:36.517 --> 02:47:39.927
TALIESIN: Oh, I bet you don't like that, all right.

02:47:41.457 --> 02:47:42.823
TRAVIS: And it takes root, right?

02:47:42.823 --> 02:47:45.250
It doesn't, like, start and then fight it off?

02:47:46.107 --> 02:47:49.377
MATT: You see no signs of it pulling back.

02:47:49.377 --> 02:47:51.067
LIAM: I'm going to Superman spiral over

02:47:51.067 --> 02:47:55.387
to the statue figure that I see by the gazebo tower

02:47:56.397 --> 02:47:57.537
and take a closer look at it.

02:47:57.537 --> 02:47:59.842
LAURA: Yeah, what's that doing--

02:47:59.842 --> 02:48:02.040
LIAM: There's two of them. One's off camera right now.

02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:05.541
MARISHA: This here and that? Okay.

02:48:05.541 --> 02:48:07.671
MATT: You go towards--
MARISHA: Sorry, did I?

02:48:07.671 --> 02:48:10.787
I did not. Did I? I would feel real bad.

02:48:10.787 --> 02:48:12.237
I'm so sorry!

02:48:12.237 --> 02:48:13.070
TRAVIS: That's okay, ready?

02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:14.202
One, two, three.

02:48:14.202 --> 02:48:16.627
MARISHA: (yelps)
(laughter)

02:48:17.535 --> 02:48:19.027
TALIESIN: No lasers in this theater!

02:48:20.157 --> 02:48:22.937
MATT: You head to it and you see what is represented

02:48:22.937 --> 02:48:27.517
as a massive statue of a human.

02:48:27.517 --> 02:48:28.966
And as you get close to it,

02:48:28.966 --> 02:48:33.747
the details are fuzzy or gone.

02:48:33.747 --> 02:48:36.787
Like the memory of whoever the statue once represented

02:48:36.787 --> 02:48:40.957
has begun to drift and as such--

02:48:40.957 --> 02:48:45.017
It is built and presented in a very memorial type of way.

02:48:45.017 --> 02:48:46.967
This is meant to be in memory

02:48:46.967 --> 02:48:49.800
of a great figure of the Aeorian history.

02:48:51.517 --> 02:48:56.517
But as time has gone on, they're just a blank face

02:48:56.537 --> 02:48:58.187
on a relatively featureless body.

02:49:00.737 --> 02:49:02.767
LIAM: Well, then I will just push past

02:49:02.767 --> 02:49:04.937
and walk into the bottom of the tower.

02:49:04.937 --> 02:49:05.770
MATT: Okay.

02:49:05.770 --> 02:49:07.510
TALIESIN: Have we explored every building now?

02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:09.350
LAURA: Yeah, except for the gazebo.

02:49:10.837 --> 02:49:13.977
LIAM: You would have said if there was text on it, yeah?

02:49:13.977 --> 02:49:16.687
MATT: Correct, there's no text on this one.

02:49:16.687 --> 02:49:19.429
But you can make an investigation check if you want to look.

02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:20.495
LIAM: Sure.

02:49:22.297 --> 02:49:24.890
Uh, 16.

02:49:25.967 --> 02:49:26.800
MATT: 16.

02:49:27.737 --> 02:49:31.707
Glancing around, this space is-- it's fairly empty.

02:49:31.707 --> 02:49:33.407
It looks like this is part of the--

02:49:35.844 --> 02:49:37.707
part of the small park aesthetic here,

02:49:37.707 --> 02:49:39.867
like it was a hangout space.

02:49:39.867 --> 02:49:42.207
Where the stairs come down,

02:49:42.207 --> 02:49:45.717
you see a very faint fold or line

02:49:45.717 --> 02:49:47.737
in what would normally be solid stone ground.

02:49:47.737 --> 02:49:50.517
Like at a certain point it creates

02:49:50.517 --> 02:49:53.547
this weird, lip-like line in the floor.

02:49:53.547 --> 02:49:55.107
LIAM: And does the eyesight tell me

02:49:55.107 --> 02:49:57.837
that this is a magically hidden exit?

02:49:57.837 --> 02:50:01.484
MATT: Not magically, this is a physical line in the ground.

02:50:05.557 --> 02:50:09.035
LIAM: I'm going to finger it open.

02:50:10.507 --> 02:50:12.607
MATT: As you touch the exterior,

02:50:12.607 --> 02:50:15.337
and it does give a little bit on your finger,

02:50:15.337 --> 02:50:19.837
it opens up into a similar port hole filled with teeth

02:50:21.097 --> 02:50:23.007
and the stairs continue downward.

02:50:23.007 --> 02:50:24.723
SAM: Hey.
MARISHA: That's it?

02:50:24.723 --> 02:50:26.715
SAM: Basement at the Alamo.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:50:26.715 --> 02:50:31.067
I think to everybody: winner winner chicken dinner.

02:50:31.067 --> 02:50:32.457
MARISHA: I come back out.

02:50:32.457 --> 02:50:35.447
ASHLEY: Can I check out the other
statue in the other corner?

02:50:35.447 --> 02:50:37.322
LAURA: All at once?
LIAM: It's one way.

02:50:37.322 --> 02:50:38.980
SAM: Amazing.

02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:39.926
MATT: You go over and inspect it

02:50:39.926 --> 02:50:43.510
and it's an exact duplicate of the other statute.

02:50:44.425 --> 02:50:46.057
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:50:46.057 --> 02:50:47.697
MATT: Like, it's an exact copy

02:50:47.697 --> 02:50:51.627
of a faded rendition of something.

02:50:51.627 --> 02:50:56.040
So it's an odd focus to detail for not having much detail.

02:50:58.577 --> 02:50:59.410
TALIESIN: Look at that.

02:51:00.637 --> 02:51:02.420
It's the idea of a memory.

02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:05.600
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, when you just start forgetting.

02:51:07.727 --> 02:51:09.287
Things become fuzzy.

02:51:09.287 --> 02:51:11.847
TALIESIN: A lot of what here and not a lot of why.

02:51:13.408 --> 02:51:16.697
LAURA: I float quickly past everyone
and head into the gazebo.

02:51:16.697 --> 02:51:19.185
SAM: Yeah, I'm going with.
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's go.

02:51:19.185 --> 02:51:22.348
MARISHA: We all follow.
TALIESIN: Into the bowels.

02:51:23.416 --> 02:51:25.351
LAURA: Ew, literally!

02:51:25.351 --> 02:51:26.777
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

02:51:26.777 --> 02:51:28.877
LIAM: Everyone into the puckering butt.

02:51:30.547 --> 02:51:31.817
MATT: Following the stairs down,

02:51:31.817 --> 02:51:34.177
and the stairs that continue downward

02:51:34.177 --> 02:51:37.517
have no give, they're pretty sturdy.

02:51:37.517 --> 02:51:39.104
And it's an awful sensation,

02:51:39.104 --> 02:51:40.657
because the temperature does get warmer

02:51:40.657 --> 02:51:43.497
the further you descend down the spiral,

02:51:43.497 --> 02:51:46.530
and gradually the stairs begin to be a little softer.

02:51:47.997 --> 02:51:52.937
You descend about 60, 70, 80 feet

02:51:52.937 --> 02:51:57.417
before the stairs become this interpretation of stairs,

02:51:57.417 --> 02:52:00.897
like natural, rough rock stairs

02:52:00.897 --> 02:52:04.380
you would find in a cavern space, but spongier.

02:52:05.248 --> 02:52:07.607
And then you reach a bottom.

02:52:07.607 --> 02:52:11.027
Here you see a semblance of a corridor

02:52:11.027 --> 02:52:13.687
that goes in three different directions.

02:52:13.687 --> 02:52:15.887
It has the same brass-like coloration

02:52:15.887 --> 02:52:17.917
of some of the subterranean Aeorian tunnels

02:52:17.917 --> 02:52:20.167
that you've encountered at various ruins

02:52:20.167 --> 02:52:21.987
and Aeor proper previously.

02:52:21.987 --> 02:52:23.457
You see the same paneling,

02:52:23.457 --> 02:52:26.882
you see the same overhead tiling of metallic plates.

02:52:26.882 --> 02:52:29.548
you see the same overhead tiling of metallic plates.

02:52:29.548 --> 02:52:31.667
But not in disarray, not scattered,

02:52:31.667 --> 02:52:36.467
not hanging tubes, and broken pipes and beams.

02:52:36.467 --> 02:52:39.270
All intact going in three different directions.

02:52:40.177 --> 02:52:41.627
But those of you who are very perceptive,

02:52:41.627 --> 02:52:45.107
as you look forward it seems to just faintly corkscrew

02:52:45.107 --> 02:52:47.507
before it reaches the outside of your periphery.

02:52:49.627 --> 02:52:52.957
SAM: And the surfaces here are still spongy

02:52:52.957 --> 02:52:54.997
or no, we're in metal now?

02:52:54.997 --> 02:52:56.407
MATT: You want to touch it?

02:52:56.407 --> 02:52:57.290
SAM: Yeah!

02:53:00.717 --> 02:53:04.977
MATT: You hit it and it gives a bit of a bounce back,

02:53:04.977 --> 02:53:06.577
like in an aluminum kind of way.

02:53:08.962 --> 02:53:11.407
It feels more metallic than flesh.

02:53:11.407 --> 02:53:12.337
MARISHA: Huh.

02:53:12.337 --> 02:53:13.820
TALIESIN: One easy way to tell.

02:53:14.897 --> 02:53:16.177
Decompose.

02:53:16.177 --> 02:53:18.396
MATT: It takes a moment, but it begins to change color.

02:53:18.396 --> 02:53:19.868
SAM: Oh.

02:53:19.868 --> 02:53:21.307
MARISHA: Intre-- Okay.

02:53:21.307 --> 02:53:22.177
TALIESIN: It's a stronger memory.

02:53:22.177 --> 02:53:25.094
MARISHA: Stronger, yeah, yeah. Okay.

02:53:25.094 --> 02:53:26.794
TALIESIN: This stuff knows what it's supposed to be.

02:53:26.794 --> 02:53:28.437
MARISHA: So.

02:53:28.437 --> 02:53:31.524
SAM: I love it, by the way, when Matt says to me,

02:53:31.524 --> 02:53:33.177
"Do you want to touch it?"

02:53:33.177 --> 02:53:34.870
It's just nice.

02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:36.457
It's a nice, familiar face.

02:53:36.457 --> 02:53:38.478
TALIESIN: God, how did it turn into that night?

02:53:39.757 --> 02:53:43.287
TRAVIS: The invisibility is still up.
Anything in this hallway?

02:53:43.287 --> 02:53:45.227
MATT: Nothing invisible.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:53:45.227 --> 02:53:46.667
MATT: But there is writing on these three tunnels.

02:53:46.667 --> 02:53:48.592
SAM: Ooh!
LIAM: Okay.

02:53:48.592 --> 02:53:50.310
Yeah, I will take care of that.
LAURA: While he's doing it,

02:53:50.310 --> 02:53:52.387
I'll hand a vial of--

02:53:52.387 --> 02:53:53.601
SAM: Oh, what's this?
LAURA: Clear liquid.

02:53:53.601 --> 02:53:55.551
I've labeled it:

02:53:55.551 --> 02:53:57.584
Unstinky House Drool.

02:53:57.584 --> 02:54:00.125
(laughter)

02:54:00.125 --> 02:54:01.199
SAM: Oh!
TALIESIN: That implies

02:54:01.199 --> 02:54:03.427
that there's a
top shelf, expensive drool.

02:54:03.427 --> 02:54:05.153
SAM: Thank you.
TALIESIN: Instead of just the house drool.

02:54:05.153 --> 02:54:06.261
LAURA: I don't know what it does,

02:54:06.261 --> 02:54:08.344
but it was falling from the ceiling.

02:54:08.344 --> 02:54:10.097
You might want to give it a test.
TRAVIS: Big mouth where we were.

02:54:10.097 --> 02:54:10.930
Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

02:54:10.930 --> 02:54:11.921
LAURA: Fjord smelled it.

02:54:11.921 --> 02:54:14.122
SAM: I will definitely run some tests.

02:54:14.122 --> 02:54:16.767
TRAVIS: Figured the the pH could be of interest to you.

02:54:16.767 --> 02:54:20.052
SAM: I will sneakily drop it on the floor.

02:54:20.052 --> 02:54:22.353
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

02:54:22.353 --> 02:54:26.311
LIAM: Just sort of slide it into the flesh.
MATT: Roll sleight of hand.

02:54:29.489 --> 02:54:31.382
SAM: 33.

02:54:32.437 --> 02:54:34.637
MATT: He accepted it without issue.

02:54:34.637 --> 02:54:36.887
LIAM: Just goes into the wall like a meat baster.

02:54:37.837 --> 02:54:40.587
MATT: (laughs) Just Homer Simpsons it.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:54:40.587 --> 02:54:42.862
LAURA: I think she liked it.

02:54:42.862 --> 02:54:45.657
LIAM: I sprinkle soot and salt in front of my vision

02:54:45.657 --> 02:54:48.267
and can read the writing on the walls.

02:54:48.267 --> 02:54:49.100
MATT: Okay.

02:54:50.567 --> 02:54:55.567
The tunnel to the right where you're standing says,

02:54:56.344 --> 02:54:58.827
"Praesidis Junction, Junction, Junction, Junction

02:54:58.827 --> 02:55:01.477
"Junction, Junction," and the words get weird.

02:55:02.547 --> 02:55:06.304
The opposite side, it just says,

02:55:06.304 --> 02:55:07.887
"Help, help, help, help, help, help

02:55:07.887 --> 02:55:10.267
"help, help, help, help, help, help, help."

02:55:10.267 --> 02:55:13.291
The one across from you says--

02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:17.118
Oh, what does it say there?

02:55:17.118 --> 02:55:18.601
It was specifically here--

02:55:19.979 --> 02:55:21.868
"Crest Vault."

02:55:21.868 --> 02:55:22.992
LAURA: Crest-- (gasps)

02:55:22.992 --> 02:55:24.390
MARISHA: That's it.
LIAM: Yeah, baby.

02:55:24.390 --> 02:55:25.223
SAM: Is it?

02:55:25.223 --> 02:55:26.581
TRAVIS: I don't think that's where we want to go.

02:55:26.581 --> 02:55:28.416
I think "help" is more immediate.

02:55:29.717 --> 02:55:31.910
SAM: What?! You're crazy!

02:55:31.910 --> 02:55:32.885
TRAVIS: It says help!

02:55:32.885 --> 02:55:34.184
TALIESIN: I think that

02:55:34.184 --> 02:55:36.759
any confrontation right now ends with us

02:55:39.976 --> 02:55:42.693
becoming a small tavern, so.

02:55:42.693 --> 02:55:45.027
(laughter)

02:55:45.027 --> 02:55:46.079
TRAVIS: Well said.

02:55:46.079 --> 02:55:49.617
LAURA: Can I try to roll for Divine Intervention?

02:55:49.617 --> 02:55:50.720
MATT: But of course.

02:55:52.417 --> 02:55:54.785
SAM: Have we ever heard "Crest Vault" before?

02:55:54.785 --> 02:55:57.147
MARISHA: Well, the threshold crests.

02:55:57.147 --> 02:55:59.720
SAM: Threshold crests, yes, that makes sense.

02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:00.720
TALIESIN: And a toothpaste.

02:56:04.217 --> 02:56:05.050
LAURA: Nah.

02:56:07.247 --> 02:56:10.761
MATT: You look towards Sprinkle who looks back.

02:56:10.761 --> 02:56:12.786
(chittering)

02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:16.097
Arty's not in at the moment.

02:56:16.097 --> 02:56:19.112
TALIESIN: Maybe we need to call for help.
LAURA: I just give him a little scritch.

02:56:19.112 --> 02:56:20.020
MARISHA: That poor weasel.

02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:20.853
TRAVIS: "Put me in space!"

02:56:20.853 --> 02:56:21.686
MARISHA: Yes!

02:56:21.686 --> 02:56:23.419
It adds to his

02:56:23.419 --> 02:56:24.660
psychosis.
TRAVIS: "Let me fly!"

02:56:24.660 --> 02:56:25.876
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:56:25.876 --> 02:56:27.424
TRAVIS: "Die among the stars!"

02:56:27.424 --> 02:56:32.294
(laughter)

02:56:32.294 --> 02:56:34.227
(laughter)

02:56:34.227 --> 02:56:36.216
MATT: Could we make it Sprinkle shirt that says that?

02:56:36.216 --> 02:56:38.716
"Please, I want to die among the stars."

02:56:38.716 --> 02:56:41.512
(laughter)

02:56:41.512 --> 02:56:43.677
LIAM: It's hard to know how to interpret that help, though.

02:56:43.677 --> 02:56:48.677
I mean, those things up top
were relieved to be killed and maybe--

02:56:49.097 --> 02:56:51.757
TALIESIN: I think that direction's probably a fight.

02:56:51.757 --> 02:56:53.067
MARISHA: Yeah, 100%.

02:56:53.067 --> 02:56:55.130
TALIESIN: I think that we can find--

02:56:56.557 --> 02:56:59.550
Maybe it's just a matter of calling who we want to talk to.

02:57:01.467 --> 02:57:05.117
MARISHA: You said the tunnel corkscrews,
the one ahead of us?

02:57:05.117 --> 02:57:07.690
MATT: It seems to shift a little bit to one--

02:57:07.690 --> 02:57:10.197
It begins to turn slightly one way before the--

02:57:10.197 --> 02:57:12.627
MARISHA: This way, like very fun house-style?

02:57:12.627 --> 02:57:13.543
MATT: A little bit, yeah.

02:57:13.543 --> 02:57:15.715
MARISHA: And that's towards the Crest Vault?

02:57:15.715 --> 02:57:16.548
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: We might be able to

02:57:16.548 --> 02:57:18.782
talk to her, too.

02:57:18.782 --> 02:57:19.615
LAURA: That's true.

02:57:22.492 --> 02:57:24.817
LAURA: Yeah, it's true, I don't need to do shit.

02:57:26.687 --> 02:57:28.237
MARISHA: Talk to some of these people.

02:57:29.437 --> 02:57:33.740
LIAM: Or Cree, if we are linked.

02:57:35.867 --> 02:57:36.957
MARISHA: The only problem with Cree

02:57:36.957 --> 02:57:39.767
is that I'm assuming Lucien can listen.

02:57:39.767 --> 02:57:42.467
LAURA: Lucien can listen to anything you're doing, anyway.

02:57:42.467 --> 02:57:44.337
Lucien could be listening to you right now.

02:57:44.337 --> 02:57:45.170
MARISHA: That's true.

02:57:46.287 --> 02:57:49.715
LIAM: Well, is everyone still wearing their medallion?

02:57:49.715 --> 02:57:50.665
SAM: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:57:50.665 --> 02:57:53.167
LAURA: It doesn't matter; he talked
to you when we were in Aeor.

02:57:53.167 --> 02:57:54.000
TRAVIS: True.

02:57:56.223 --> 02:57:57.064
Doesn't mean he--

02:57:57.064 --> 02:57:58.512
LIAM: Doesn't mean he knows where we are.

02:57:58.512 --> 02:57:59.345
LAURA: No.

02:58:01.305 --> 02:58:02.138
TALIESIN: I think--

02:58:02.138 --> 02:58:04.517
TRAVIS: It could be that one way thing.

02:58:04.517 --> 02:58:05.777
MARISHA: Well, this--

02:58:08.607 --> 02:58:10.587
TALIESIN: I still think we might have allies in the city,

02:58:10.587 --> 02:58:15.228
and I think that a friend here would be

02:58:15.228 --> 02:58:16.905
very helpful.

02:58:16.905 --> 02:58:18.447
We are exhausted.
LIAM: How much time do we have?

02:58:18.447 --> 02:58:23.277
SAM: Yeah, we have to get to
the crests before they activate.

02:58:23.277 --> 02:58:26.950
TRAVIS: Are we coming Tamora a friend?

02:58:28.770 --> 02:58:29.784
LAURA: Timorei?

02:58:29.784 --> 02:58:31.137
TRAVIS: Tamora, Timorei.

02:58:31.137 --> 02:58:33.747
TALIESIN: I think it couldn't hurt to find out,

02:58:33.747 --> 02:58:36.200
and if something terrible happens, it's not like,

02:58:37.557 --> 02:58:38.757
what are we going to do?

02:58:39.627 --> 02:58:42.677
If it's not Cree, we're--

02:58:43.697 --> 02:58:45.787
LAURA: We can try reaching out.

02:58:45.787 --> 02:58:48.241
We can try speaking to Timorei directly.

02:58:49.987 --> 02:58:51.987
LIAM: I'm not sure why we trust any of them.

02:58:54.737 --> 02:58:56.357
I don't believe anything.

02:58:56.357 --> 02:58:57.682
MARISHA: Just need more information.

02:58:57.682 --> 02:58:59.887
TALIESIN: Well, let's talk, I mean, we've talked to--

02:58:59.887 --> 02:59:04.364
MARISHA: Well, we're on the precipice of the Crests--

02:59:04.364 --> 02:59:06.949
LAURA: We just need to go, we need to follow.

02:59:06.949 --> 02:59:08.727
MARISHA: I'm not saying we shouldn't reach out,

02:59:08.727 --> 02:59:11.267
I'm just-- We're literally at the edge of this tunnel

02:59:11.267 --> 02:59:13.757
and feels like we need to make a choice.

02:59:13.757 --> 02:59:16.107
Do we keep going and check out the Crest Vault?

02:59:18.577 --> 02:59:22.147
LIAM: Perhaps if we can cut off Cree

02:59:22.147 --> 02:59:25.130
and stop this on one of the two crests,

02:59:25.130 --> 02:59:27.055
then Lucien's--
MARISHA: Yes, and we have more time.

02:59:27.055 --> 02:59:28.667
LIAM: Yes, we buy ourselves time.

02:59:28.667 --> 02:59:31.407
MARISHA: Exactly, if this is Cree.

02:59:31.407 --> 02:59:33.617
We can assume it's Cree because--

02:59:33.617 --> 02:59:36.797
LIAM: Because of the way they spoke of her.

02:59:36.797 --> 02:59:38.737
LAURA: Then let's move.
MARISHA: Let's do it.

02:59:38.737 --> 02:59:39.570
TRAVIS: Go.

02:59:40.757 --> 02:59:42.027
LIAM: Straight ahead.

02:59:42.027 --> 02:59:43.135
MATT: All right.

02:59:45.302 --> 02:59:48.680
Continuing onward, on foot for those who wish.

02:59:49.807 --> 02:59:51.277
LIAM: I'll float.
MATT: You float.

02:59:51.277 --> 02:59:52.727
SAM: Can we all still float?

02:59:52.727 --> 02:59:56.248
MATT: You can still float.
Some people move faster on foot than--

02:59:56.248 --> 02:59:57.514
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to hop every now and then.

02:59:57.514 --> 03:00:02.114
LAURA: I move a little bit faster, so I'm going to float.
TRAVIS: I do too if I float, so I'm going to float.

03:00:02.114 --> 03:00:02.947
MATT: Okay.

03:00:02.947 --> 03:00:04.430
TRAVIS: What up, Essek?

03:00:04.430 --> 03:00:06.177
MATT: Yep, Essek is the fastest of all of you.

03:00:06.177 --> 03:00:07.090
TRAVIS: Well, whatever.

03:00:08.117 --> 03:00:09.247
Even faster than you--

03:00:09.247 --> 03:00:10.665
TALIESIN: I'm going to do that wall run occasionally.

03:00:10.665 --> 03:00:11.969
MATT: Just barely.

03:00:11.969 --> 03:00:14.170
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, upside down wall, yeah.

03:00:14.170 --> 03:00:15.005
TRAVIS: Not a contest.

03:00:15.005 --> 03:00:17.346
LIAM: He's got me beat by 150 years.
TALIESIN: It's only not a contest if you're winning.

03:00:17.346 --> 03:00:18.596
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

03:00:18.596 --> 03:00:23.367
MATT: You all begin coasting forward quickly.

03:00:23.367 --> 03:00:27.027
The tunnel, as it continues onward, the metallic sides,

03:00:27.027 --> 03:00:29.847
the brass interior, dark and shadow ahead,

03:00:29.847 --> 03:00:31.617
but as the light you carry hits across

03:00:31.617 --> 03:00:33.787
it reflects in places.

03:00:33.787 --> 03:00:36.300
You watch it begin to corkscrew a bit.

03:00:37.557 --> 03:00:39.197
And then continue to corkscrew

03:00:39.197 --> 03:00:42.437
until it is completely upside down, or are <i>you</i>?

03:00:42.437 --> 03:00:44.507
Up and down, left and right is hard to tell

03:00:44.507 --> 03:00:48.117
when you're not letting gravity be the one pulling you.

03:00:48.117 --> 03:00:50.047
When you are flying or floating,

03:00:50.047 --> 03:00:52.647
the only guide you have are those that stay on foot.

03:00:54.297 --> 03:00:56.527
And it does have that vertigo sensation

03:00:56.527 --> 03:00:58.457
as it begins to shift.

03:00:58.457 --> 03:01:00.457
And the texture begins to change as well

03:01:00.457 --> 03:01:02.677
as it dips downward.

03:01:02.677 --> 03:01:05.152
The metal begins to corrode

03:01:05.152 --> 03:01:08.697
and give way to darker flesh.

03:01:08.697 --> 03:01:12.690
Purple, textured striations and flexing, skinless muscle.

03:01:13.767 --> 03:01:16.187
You can see bits that look like stone and rock,

03:01:16.187 --> 03:01:20.117
like natural cavern spaces, but with a purplish tinge.

03:01:20.117 --> 03:01:22.147
And at the edges where it's cracked,

03:01:22.147 --> 03:01:27.147
you swear you can see veins occasionally pulsing.

03:01:27.707 --> 03:01:31.407
You can see portions of it from underneath

03:01:31.407 --> 03:01:34.448
where the rock gives way entirely,

03:01:34.448 --> 03:01:37.373
and there's like a film.

03:01:38.547 --> 03:01:40.038
Some sort of a smooth, shiny sack of skin

03:01:40.038 --> 03:01:44.379
Some sort of a smooth, shiny sack of skin

03:01:44.379 --> 03:01:46.490
across a subdermal surface.

03:01:50.397 --> 03:01:52.597
And as you're heading forward

03:01:52.597 --> 03:01:54.610
you hear footsteps getting louder.

03:01:56.147 --> 03:01:57.867
MARISHA: Coming towards us or from behind us?

03:01:57.867 --> 03:02:01.100
MATT: Coming towards from
the direction that you're traveling.

03:02:01.958 --> 03:02:03.158
LAURA: Oh god.
TRAVIS: Keep going.

03:02:03.158 --> 03:02:05.016
LIAM: Probably's already affixed it.

03:02:05.016 --> 03:02:06.157
We need to undo it.

03:02:06.157 --> 03:02:06.990
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:07.917 --> 03:02:09.227
MARISHA: Are we going to kill her?

03:02:09.227 --> 03:02:10.060
LAURA and LIAM: Yes.

03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:10.893
MAIRSHA: Let's do it.

03:02:12.507 --> 03:02:14.517
MATT: What do you do?
LAURA: Should we hide?

03:02:14.517 --> 03:02:15.350
TRAVIS: In a tunnel?
MATT: (footsteps)

03:02:15.350 --> 03:02:16.617
MARISHA: Is there a way to hide?

03:02:16.617 --> 03:02:19.357
MATT: It is-- There are minor pockets.

03:02:19.357 --> 03:02:20.567
As you look around--

03:02:22.135 --> 03:02:24.107
For lack of a better way of explaining it,

03:02:24.107 --> 03:02:26.807
mild folds in the walls

03:02:26.807 --> 03:02:30.127
that you might attempt to utilize at your disposal.

03:02:30.127 --> 03:02:31.657
TRAVIS: I'm going to make myself look like the old woman

03:02:31.657 --> 03:02:34.347
with the bun on her hair that we saw in the town square.

03:02:34.347 --> 03:02:36.720
MARISHA: I'll squeeze into a flesh fold.

03:02:39.149 --> 03:02:40.282
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'll become

03:02:40.282 --> 03:02:44.273
one of the strange blank people as well.

03:02:44.273 --> 03:02:45.106
MATT: Okay.

03:02:45.106 --> 03:02:47.687
LIAM: I'll choose an adjacent fold.

03:02:47.687 --> 03:02:49.720
LAURA: I'm going to choose a fold, as well.

03:02:51.357 --> 03:02:53.177
SAM: I will snuggle into a fold

03:02:53.177 --> 03:02:56.565
and cast Mage Hand just to have out.

03:02:56.565 --> 03:02:57.398
MATT: Okay.

03:02:58.577 --> 03:03:00.830
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go into a fold.

03:03:05.817 --> 03:03:06.650
MATT: Very well.

03:03:06.650 --> 03:03:08.337
ASHLEY: Wonderful, moist.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:03:08.337 --> 03:03:12.817
MATT: Everyone who's attempting to... step into a fold,

03:03:12.817 --> 03:03:15.267
go ahead and roll a stealth check for me, please.

03:03:16.582 --> 03:03:17.415
SAM: Yeah.

03:03:18.727 --> 03:03:19.560
Gross.

03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:21.237
LAURA: Thanks for blowing that towards me.

03:03:21.237 --> 03:03:22.537
TRAVIS: It's actually down, but.

03:03:23.757 --> 03:03:26.848
LAURA: No! (laughs)

03:03:29.467 --> 03:03:32.353
TRAVIS: Burned my mouth, so, be ready.
LAURA: 22.

03:03:32.353 --> 03:03:34.078
LIAM: Seven.
LAURA: (groans)

03:03:34.078 --> 03:03:35.744
SAM: 25.
MATT: Okay.

03:03:35.744 --> 03:03:37.737
ASHLEY: 17.
MATT: Okay.

03:03:37.737 --> 03:03:38.570
MARISHA: 24.

03:03:49.557 --> 03:03:51.410
LAURA: Can I give you Blessing of the Trickster?

03:03:54.207 --> 03:03:55.807
MATT: As you all sit there and wait,

03:03:56.817 --> 03:03:58.367
the two of you out in the open

03:03:58.367 --> 03:04:00.807
with your shapes changed and everyone else--

03:04:00.807 --> 03:04:03.677
TRAVIS: Not looking at anyone, walking.
MATT: -- finding pockets.

03:04:03.677 --> 03:04:06.686
MATT: The footsteps (heavy footsteps)

03:04:06.686 --> 03:04:09.319
come to a stop about 40 feet out.

03:04:10.987 --> 03:04:14.217
You can see just, no swords out, so there's no light.

03:04:14.217 --> 03:04:16.887
You're just looking in pitch darkness.

03:04:16.887 --> 03:04:18.057
TRAVIS: Darkvision, 60 feet.

03:04:18.057 --> 03:04:20.637
MATT: Exactly, which everyone
by Caduceus can see at this point,

03:04:20.637 --> 03:04:24.506
if the sword has been extinguished at this point.

03:04:24.506 --> 03:04:26.739
TALIESIN: Two games without darkvision, just saying.

03:04:26.739 --> 03:04:28.955
(laughter)

03:04:30.347 --> 03:04:31.605
MATT: You had it briefly.

03:04:31.605 --> 03:04:35.914
(laughter)

03:04:38.057 --> 03:04:41.178
MATT: You just hear breathing. (panting)

03:04:42.127 --> 03:04:44.137
LAURA: Does it sound like Cree breathing?

03:04:44.137 --> 03:04:45.667
MATT: It sounds like breathing.

03:04:45.667 --> 03:04:48.577
TALIESIN: Sounds like a cat purr.
TRAVIS: Which is something.

03:04:48.577 --> 03:04:50.077
MATT: Can make an insight check.

03:04:51.957 --> 03:04:53.220
LAURA: Insight?
MATT: Insight.

03:04:54.497 --> 03:04:57.165
LAURA: Oh, ooh!

03:04:57.165 --> 03:05:00.394
23!

03:05:00.394 --> 03:05:02.578
MATT: You don't know who this is,

03:05:02.578 --> 03:05:07.426
but they are definitely physically winded.

03:05:07.426 --> 03:05:08.759
but they are definitely physically winded.

03:05:12.277 --> 03:05:13.577
And there is a

03:05:13.577 --> 03:05:17.835
faint, curious upturn to a growl,

03:05:17.835 --> 03:05:19.837
like a (growls).

03:05:20.943 --> 03:05:21.776
LAURA: (whispers) Cree.

03:05:23.347 --> 03:05:26.677
MATT: At that point, faint bits of red light

03:05:26.677 --> 03:05:31.060
begin to fill the hall from two different spaces as

03:05:31.060 --> 03:05:34.969
the eyes on Caleb and Beau's body

03:05:34.969 --> 03:05:39.080
suddenly glow like red beacons, exposing their locations.

03:05:40.107 --> 03:05:41.698
And in that moment,

03:05:41.698 --> 03:05:46.302
two red eyes glow on Cree's body.

03:05:46.302 --> 03:05:49.727
"Ah, I was wondering when you would catch up."

03:05:51.867 --> 03:05:52.900
And we're going to end there for today.

03:05:52.900 --> 03:05:55.748
TRAVIS: Oh no, you motherfucker!

03:05:55.748 --> 03:05:56.581
ASHLEY: (groans)

03:05:57.514 --> 03:05:59.297
MARISHA: Okie doke.

03:05:59.297 --> 03:06:00.957
MATT: We'll go into this hallway showdown

03:06:00.957 --> 03:06:02.507
that I have to build next week.

03:06:04.015 --> 03:06:05.650
See how this goes.
TRAVIS: One

03:06:05.650 --> 03:06:07.842
on six?

03:06:09.011 --> 03:06:10.968
TALIESIN: He could-- We are--
LAURA: I have--

03:06:10.968 --> 03:06:13.876
I have some thoughts.
TALIESIN: We are not six, we are like, we are--

03:06:14.727 --> 03:06:15.560
SAM: We're eight. We got

03:06:15.560 --> 03:06:17.504
Essek, we got Sprinkle.
TALIESIN: We're kind of broken at the moment.

03:06:17.504 --> 03:06:19.534
LIAM: You might lose Beau and Caleb.
LAURA: We're a little broken.

03:06:19.534 --> 03:06:21.558
We're not super broken, we're a little broken.

03:06:21.558 --> 03:06:23.783
TRAVIS: It's not just Cree.

03:06:25.557 --> 03:06:27.327
LIAM: Jack Nicholson nod.

03:06:27.327 --> 03:06:29.525
MATT: (laughs)

03:06:29.525 --> 03:06:32.900
But nevertheless, we'll pick up from there next week.

03:06:33.907 --> 03:06:38.717
As you are now traversing the subterranean depths--

03:06:38.717 --> 03:06:40.273
MARISHA: Subdermal.
MATT: -- of the Cognouza Ward.

03:06:40.273 --> 03:06:42.068
The subdermal depths, you're right.

03:06:42.068 --> 03:06:43.480
(groaning)

03:06:43.480 --> 03:06:45.058
TRAVIS: Put some sleeves on, Beau!

03:06:45.058 --> 03:06:46.424
MATT: Ugh. You ever, like--

03:06:46.424 --> 03:06:48.102
TRAVIS: Cover your shit up, Caleb.

03:06:49.010 --> 03:06:50.717
MARISHA: That's true, we got on sleeves, right?

03:06:50.717 --> 03:06:53.077
Or is it really, like, humid?

03:06:53.077 --> 03:06:55.813
MATT: It's whatever you wore into Aeor.

03:06:55.813 --> 03:06:58.177
SAM: Sleeves are bullshit.
MARISHA: They're bullshit.

03:06:58.177 --> 03:06:59.913
MATT: You probably have sleeves.

03:06:59.913 --> 03:07:01.740
MARISHA: Yeah, but it glows the sleeves.

03:07:01.740 --> 03:07:03.916
LAURA: Yeah, we would've been shedding our coats here

03:07:03.916 --> 03:07:04.887
because it's getting warmer.

03:07:04.887 --> 03:07:06.783
LIAM: We each have one on our hands, so.

03:07:06.783 --> 03:07:07.899
MATT: Yeah.

03:07:07.899 --> 03:07:09.847
MARISHA: I got one right here now.

03:07:09.847 --> 03:07:12.281
TRAVIS: They're like E.T. (humming)

03:07:12.281 --> 03:07:14.797
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: (shushing)

03:07:14.797 --> 03:07:17.757
MATT: I'm excited to see what's going to come soon.

03:07:17.757 --> 03:07:19.107
All right, well, thank you so much

03:07:19.107 --> 03:07:20.857
for joining us this week.

03:07:20.857 --> 03:07:22.337
We'll see you next week.

03:07:22.337 --> 03:07:25.222
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

03:07:25.222 --> 03:07:26.708
Good night.
TRAVIS: I don't want to wait a week.

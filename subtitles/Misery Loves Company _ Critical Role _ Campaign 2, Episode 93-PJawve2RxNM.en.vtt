00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.090
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.120
of Critical Role, where a bunch

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.250
of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.390
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.090
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.482
MATT: That was a thinner one this week.

7
00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.530
LAURA: Yeah.

8
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.390
TRAVIS: People bailed on me.

9
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.227
MATT: Yeah, your friends abandoned you on that.

10
00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:17.187
ASHLEY: I was with you.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

11
00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:18.580
(laughter)

12
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.560
TALIESIN: In spirit.

13
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.640
MATT: So before we get into tonight's session,

14
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.860
we have some announcements to get through,

15
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.400
beginning with two sponsors for the evening.

16
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.900
First up, we have a new sponsor for the show,

17
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.520
specifically Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II.

18
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160
Sam!

19
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.610
SAM: Raise rise up, for it is I, Drak'ar Noir,

20
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580
from the Fantasy Ranch.

21
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.020
You may have seen me

22
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.480
on Travis Willingham's Yee-Haw Game Ranch,

23
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810
where I survived the cabbage stench

24
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.184
of that ill-bred, yeasty canker sore Brian Foster!

25
00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.458
ASHLEY: (laughing)
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

26
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.990
SAM: But tonight, I shall raise
rise up for our sponsor,

27
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.150
the critically acclaimed,

28
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.000
turn-based pixel art adventure game,

29
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.181
Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II.

30
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.230
(cheering)

31
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.760
In Fantasy Ranch, we are
addicted to this retro-style game,

32
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730
which simulates the classic pen-and-paper,

33
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.400
role-playing experience with satire and humor

34
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.540
and feels like you're sitting
at the table with friends.

35
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.820
And now I will sing its praises, literally,

36
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.086
with a song our finest bards
composed for the occasion.

37
00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:24.327
TRAVIS: Oh no!
LAURA: Oh-- (laughs)

38
00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:25.462
MARISHA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah!

39
00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:27.461
(solemn guitar music)

40
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:30.150
SAM: A little bit of an intro (coughs).

66
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.698
MATT: I think it's the best facet
of Sam we could ever enjoy.

67
00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:39.170
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: Thank you, Sam,

68
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.180
and thank you, Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II.
ASHLEY: That was amazing.

69
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.980
MATT: Our second sponsor tonight

70
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.050
for Campaign 2, since the beginning,

71
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.002

who haven't heard us sing
their praises before,

75
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.850
D&amp;D Beyond is a fantastic online digital tool

76
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.880

84
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.360
I'm going to be thorough in
my announcement there.

85
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.990
LAURA: Not Thoreau, though.

86
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.656

MATT: Not yet, we're not in it yet!

90
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.390
Bring it down.

91
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.650
Yeah, thank you, guys at D&amp;D Beyond,

92
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.470
for continuing to support the show.

93
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.020
We have a couple of announcements.

94
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.880
Oh, earlier this week, if you guys haven't seen it,

95
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.023
we announced our live show in Chicago.

96
00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:35.460
TRAVIS: ♪ In Chicago, Chicago ♪
ASHLEY: Yay, Chi-Town!

97
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.350
MATT: Leading into our appearance at C2E2

98
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.580
at the end of next month,
the Thursday, February 27th,

99
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.070
at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.

100
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.660
We're going to have a live, in-canon episode

101
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.350
for anyone who's in the
region and wants to come see.

102
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.870
Tickets are on sale, VIP tickets
will go on sale Wednesday,

103
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.410
and February 5th at 10 a.m. Central,

104
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.470
the regular tickets will be on sale.

105
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.790
Oh, sorry, let me get that back.

106
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.790
This sentence was--

107
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.580
VIP tickets will be on sale
Wednesday, February 5th,

108
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.090
at 10 a.m Central, there we go,

109
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.410
and regular tickets will be on sale
Thursday, February 6th,

110
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.910
at 10 a.m. Central, so day after day.

111
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.100
I should read the right order
in the sentences there.

112
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.240
But if you can't attend our
show, that's totally fine.

113
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.880
Our broadcast on the 27th
will start an hour earlier,

114
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.130
because we'll be doing it live from there.

115
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.990
So it'll be at 6 p.m.

116
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.920
as opposed to 7 p.m. Pacific, that Thursday.

117
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.150
So be ready for that.

118
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.390
Put it in your calendar for those who want

119
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.300
to be there for it live.

120
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.380

121
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.005

122
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.740
TRAVIS: It's a really pretty theater, you guys.

123
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.688
LAURA: Yeah, it's a really pretty theater.
TRAVIS: Historic.

124
00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:38.827
ASHLEY: The Stork?

125
00:04:38.827 --> 00:04:40.464
TRAVIS: Historic!
LIAM: Historic!

126
00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:42.190
(laughter)

127
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.168
ASHLEY: I was like, what a
strange name for a theater!

128
00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.559
(laughter)

129
00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:47.808
TRAVIS: It's their mascot
LIAM: The stork.

130
00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.062
MARISHA: Go to a show, in nine
months you have a baby.

131
00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:53.147
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I'll leave.

132
00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:54.855
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: A lot of nooks and crannies

133
00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.304
at the Stork, a lot of dark corners.

134
00:04:58.304 --> 00:04:59.630
MARISHA: [Inaudible] and drink.

135
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.931
(laughter)
MATT: All righty.

136
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.680
In case you also missed the news earlier today,

137
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.470
we have a non-fiction book

138
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.715
coming out now, announced.
TRAVIS: We do!

139
00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:09.806
TRAVIS: Woo!

140
00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:12.100
MATT: Our friends at Penguin
Ran-don House, Penguin Random--

141
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.210
I can't talk today!

142
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.400
Our friends at Penguin Random House.

143
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.460
I have a problem with Penguin apparently,

144
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.653
just like Benedict Cumberbatch.

145
00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:20.850
TRAVIS: Just say perpetual
advantage, perpetual advantage.

146
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.815
MATT: Perpetual advantage.
TRAVIS: Yes, got it!

147
00:05:22.815 --> 00:05:24.058
Does that count?
MARISHA: Nailed it!

148
00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:25.420
Hell yeah!
TRAVIS: (grunts)

149
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.812
All game.
MATT: I'm not the DM yet.

150
00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:28.695
I'm doing announcements.

151
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.662
But yes, we have a non-fiction book

152
00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.070
called World of Critical Role.

153
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.960
They've been working on for a while now with us,

154
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.350
that just goes over, as opposed

155
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.500
to in-canon stories and art books and such,

156
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.560
this is a deep narrative
about how all this happened.

157
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.387
It's a bunch of, like, really personal interviews

158
00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.940
about us, from point to point,
the entire weird reality

159
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.315
that has led us here and beyond.

160
00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:54.410
It's already looking really cool.

161
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.120
I believe it's coming out September in bookstores,

162
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.170
local bookstores all over, but it
is available for pre-order now,

163
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.055
if you're interested.

164
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:04.310
For those of you in the US,

165
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.050
Penguin Random House is
also offering a chance

166
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.180
to get your name printed
in the book, apparently,

167
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.670
which is kind of cool.

168
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.780
So for all the details, head to critrole.com

169
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.460
to check out more about it.

170
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.160
Marisha, you have an announcement.

171
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.401
MARISHA: Oh man, this Tuesday,

172
00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:18.520
TRAVIS: (laughs)

173
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.830
MARISHA: All Work No Play, it's coming back.

174
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.630
Get in here, Riegel.

175
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.140
SAM: Wow!
MARISHA: Whoa!

176
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.500
SAM: It's really coming back.

177
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.940
MARISHA: It's really coming back.

178
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.773
SAM: Wow!

179
00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:33.773
MARISHA: At 4 p.m. on our Twitch channel, the first episode.

180
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.040
The boys dive into some chainsaw art.

181
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.200
SAM: Oh, is that what we start with?

182
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.350
MARISHA: You're starting with
chainsaw art with Julie Nathanson.

183
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.080
SAM: We have all our digits still, spoiler.
LIAM: Is this a set up to a bit,

184
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.890
or is it really coming back?

185
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.740
MARISHA: No, it's really coming back.

186
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.670
TALIESIN: Really.
MARISHA: I know.

187
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.911
LIAM: I'll believe it when I see it.

188
00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:49.670
ASHLEY: What is chainsaw art,

189
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.503
like with ice?

190
00:06:50.503 --> 00:06:53.230
MARISHA: You'll have to find out. This Tuesday!
LAURA: They legitimately play with chainsaws.

191
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.650
SAM: Do you know what penis art is?

192
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.190
ASHLEY: Absolutely.
SAM: It's kind of the same thing.

193
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.220
MARISHA: 4:00pm!

194
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.160
ASHLEY: Have you never been to my house?

195
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.930
(laughter)

196
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.600
TALIESIN: A lot of bedazzling.
ASHLEY: A lot of bedazzling.

197
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.280
MARISHA: If you miss the live broadcast, as always,

198
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.260
VOD's immediately on our Twitch,

199
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.360
and then All Work No Play will be up

200
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.650
on YouTube on Thursdays.

201
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.590
SAM: Whew!

202
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.423
LAURA: Tight.

203
00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:21.256
LIAM: Coming at ya.

204
00:07:21.256 --> 00:07:22.430
TRAVIS: I'm so excited.
SAM: I am too.

205
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.755
TRAVIS: Number-one fan in the house.
SAM: That's right, you are.

206
00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:25.810
TRAVIS: I got a new hat and shirt and everything.

207
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.735
LAURA: It's fun.
TRAVIS: I made a sign.

208
00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:29.390
LAURA: It's fun.
(laughter)

209
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.440
TRAVIS: Studio audience for this show?

210
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.992
LAURA: He literally wears it at home.

211
00:07:31.992 --> 00:07:32.930
TALIESIN: You're just going to stand on the corner,

212
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.161
aren't you, with a sign, be very excited.

213
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:34.994
TRAVIS: Woo!

214
00:07:34.994 --> 00:07:36.831
(laughter)

215
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.844
TRAVIS: Woo-hoo!

216
00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:40.520
MARISHA: There's a thing in the break, right, Kyle?

217
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.353
KYLE: Yup!

218
00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:42.186
MARISHA: Yeah, there's a thing in the break.

219
00:07:42.186 --> 00:07:43.880
TRAVIS: A thing in the break.
MARISHA: A teaser, so, yes.

220
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.257
ASHLEY: Your runes actually say "all work, no play."

221
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:50.080
(laughter)

222
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.129
TRAVIS: Back to the shiz-ow.

223
00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:53.567
(laughter)

224
00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:54.721
MATT: (groans)

225
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:57.600
LIAM: By the way, my favorite puppet penis I saw

226
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.706
at Ashley's is the Medusa,

227
00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:00.987
not to be missed.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's great.

228
00:08:00.987 --> 00:08:03.229
You bedazzled it.
TALIESIN: I did.

229
00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:05.700
That was a fun afternoon into an evening.
ASHLEY: That was a fun afternoon.

230
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.780
MATT: Yeah, no,

231
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.850
that really carries the whole scale effect

232
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.260
to a whole different level.
TALIESIN: It wasn't hard.

233
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.704
MATT: Well, not originally.

234
00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:14.120
(laughter)

235
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.735
MATT: So, so (laughs)!

236
00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:19.200
LIAM: It's really like an optical illusion, right,

237
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.300
when you take a pencil and you go like this.

238
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.870
TALIESIN: It follows you around the room,

239
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.940
no matter where you go.

240
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.773
MATT: All right!

241
00:08:24.773 --> 00:08:26.530
(laughter)

242
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.490
MATT: All right!

243
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.440
TALIESIN: Oh no.

244
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.160
MATT: So.

245
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.220
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

246
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.017
MATT: Let's go ahead and jump into

247
00:08:34.017 --> 00:08:37.808

(dragon roaring)

285
00:10:16.968 --> 00:10:18.121
MATT: Welcome back.

286
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.271
So last we left off:

287
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:24.746
The Mighty Nein, upon watching

288
00:10:24.746 --> 00:10:29.475
and aiding Caleb finally finish his design,

289
00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:33.446
completing what Halas once had attempted to complete,

290
00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:36.991
designing a spell in which you
could transmogrify another person

291
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:39.863
into a different body of their choosing,

292
00:10:39.863 --> 00:10:43.697
the ritual attempted but failing

293
00:10:43.697 --> 00:10:46.681
at the realization that a curse still remained on Nott

294
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:51.681
that prevented any sort of shift or change.

295
00:10:51.877 --> 00:10:54.014
Trailing the source back, it seems,

296
00:10:54.014 --> 00:10:56.790
to the individual responsible for cursing her

297
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.960
with the goblin body in the first place, you returned

298
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.920
to Zadash to research this possible individual,

299
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.220
coming to find it might be this Isharnai the Prism Sage,

300
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.190
an individual that lives north of Kamordah,

301
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.520
in the Bromkiln Hills, within the Cyrios Mountains,

302
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.770
near Mount Mentiri.

303
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.100
After this moment, you realized you had

304
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.700
to travel west from Zadash to Kamordah,

305
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.875
and wanting to clarify the possible link

306
00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:27.940
of this sage

307
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.300
that had originally done this terrible deed to Nott

308
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.192
at the request of the goblins that had killed her,

309
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.680
you met the Lionett family. A tense reunion,

310
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.850
long held back, ensued, at which point,

311
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.850
it was confirmed that it seems this same sage

312
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.550
that helped bring her family's fortune

313
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:58.360
and had put a black cloud over her name and life

314
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.820
since she was born may indeed be the same one

315
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.920
that's responsible for Nott's predicament.

316
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.990
This tense reunion complete, you all stepped outside,

317
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.840
into the evening rain and gave Beau a hug of support

318
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.110
after the emotional, exhausting interaction.

319
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.040
And that's where we left off.

320
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.040
As you all pull away, outside of the Lionett estate,

321
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.110
the darkened sky above,

322
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.540
the cold rain pattering around you in the muddy streets,

323
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.010
the smell of sulfur and minerals still strong in the air,

324
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.150
what would you like to do?

325
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.870
SAM: We just left the Lionett house?

326
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.703
MATT: Correct.

327
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.450
LAURA: Are we finding somewhere to stay here,

328
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.000
or are we heading straight out?

329
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.300
MARISHA: What time is it?

330
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.470
MATT: At this point, I'd say it's close to eight o'clock.

331
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.210
It's not terribly late.

332
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.533
LAURA: But it's around dinnertime.
SAM: 8 p.m.

333
00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:00.366
LAURA: Yeah.

334
00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:01.670
LIAM: It's an estate, right?

335
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.650
It's not a town, was it?

336
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.277
LAURA: It is a town.
LIAM: It is a town?

337
00:13:05.277 --> 00:13:06.110
TALIESIN: It was a town

338
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.935
at the bottom of a hill.
LIAM: All right.

339
00:13:07.935 --> 00:13:10.870
SAM: But up here, it's just a vineyard,

340
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.137
and then a few miles over, another vineyard,

341
00:13:13.137 --> 00:13:14.650
or do we have neighbors?

342
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.170
MARISHA: There's a tavern not too (coughs) far, sorry.

343
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.080
SAM: Choked up from that meeting?

344
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.950
MARISHA: A little phlegm still from that. Lot of snot.

345
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.070
Yeah, there's a dive bar with a few beds, not far.

346
00:13:29.394 --> 00:13:30.690
Right?
LAURA: Let's do that.

347
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.642
MATT: Yeah, you can go in there.

348
00:13:31.642 --> 00:13:33.510
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: (laughs)

349
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.343
LAURA: Yeah.

350
00:13:34.343 --> 00:13:35.176
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Wait, are we going to run

351
00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:36.799
into your old crew there?

352
00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:37.632
Are we going to see, like, a bunch

353
00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:39.658
of old high school dropouts or anything?

354
00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:42.050
Are there going to be fights before we go to the real fight?

355
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.960
Is your name going to be written on the bathroom wall

356
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.240
by six different hands?

357
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.840
MARISHA: That, maybe, yeah.

358
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.174
Yeah.
TRAVIS: We have to go.

359
00:13:51.174 --> 00:13:52.115
MARISHA: Yeah.

360
00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:52.948
LAURA: Yes.

361
00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:54.732
MARISHA: We'll see.

362
00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:57.290
SAM: Beauregard, I stole this from your dad's house.

363
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.123
MARISHA: What, what?

364
00:13:58.123 --> 00:14:01.610
SAM: It's just a little statue of a rabbit made of jade.

365
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.443
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

366
00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:03.550
SAM: Do you want it?

367
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.770
MARISHA: No, you keep it.

368
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.600
SAM: I just thought, I don't know,

369
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.045
fuck that guy, right?

370
00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:12.350
MARISHA: (sighs)

371
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.830
I'm, yeah, I'm--

372
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.770
I'm working it out.

373
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.410
LIAM: How 'bout a drink?

374
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.310
MARISHA: That sounds fucking fantastic.

375
00:14:25.443 --> 00:14:26.943
LAURA: Did you steal anything else?

376
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.957
SAM: I mean, just the hearts of America, but--

377
00:14:30.957 --> 00:14:32.500
LIAM: Where?

378
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.243
SAM: Sorry, I blacked out for a second.

379
00:14:34.243 --> 00:14:37.110
(laughter)

380
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.840
ASHLEY: I haven't been there.

381
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.440
But I haven't been a lot of places.

382
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.390
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a place.

383
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.160
Look, we would totally lead the way,

384
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.970
but this is your fucking stomping grounds, so you know.

385
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.140
MARISHA: Yeah, follow me.

386
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.440
What is the name of that bar?

387
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.882
I feel like I read some--

388
00:14:54.882 --> 00:14:56.885
MATT: Gemmed Hearth Inn.

389
00:14:56.885 --> 00:14:58.579
And it's called an inn loosely.

390
00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:01.580
(laughter)

391
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.040
MATT: As you recall, it has three rooms

392
00:15:05.427 --> 00:15:09.680
that are repurposed storage chambers,

393
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.850
and mostly, people that crash there do so

394
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.030
because they've had too much to drink

395
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.090
and just need a place to crash

396
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.600
or are too drunk to ask for a place to crash

397
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.183
and they're placed there anyway
and charged the following morning.

398
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.005
But it's been a while since you traveled to this space.

399
00:15:25.005 --> 00:15:25.838
ALL: ♪ It's been a while ♪

400
00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:27.291
MATT: Yeah, I was waiting for it as soon as I said it.

401
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.200
(laughter)

402
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.430
TALIESIN: Have we finally found
the D&amp;D equivalent of a hostel?

403
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.558
Have we finally found a hostel?

404
00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:33.511
TRAVIS: (laughs)

405
00:15:33.511 --> 00:15:34.840
MATT: Kinda, yeah.
TALIESIN: All right.

406
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.460
TRAVIS: Oh shit, are the beds in the open spaces?

407
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.399
MARISHA: No, there's walls.

408
00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.676
There's walls.

409
00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:44.638
TALIESIN: (snickers)

410
00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:45.520
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.
TRAVIS: Two walls, apparently,

411
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.330
separating three spaces, what a thrill.

412
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.559
LIAM: Walls are the defining features.

413
00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:51.490
MATT: (laughs) All righty.

414
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.193
So gathering your things,

415
00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:54.770
you still have your horses with you.

416
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.070
They were hitched outside of the estate.

417
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.130
So you go ahead and take their leads

418
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.640
and walk them through the not quite as busied streets,

419
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.550
now that the sun is down.

420
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.440
There are lanterns that have been placed out

421
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.220
since the sun set, these large poles with hooks on them

422
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.420
where, at night, these lanterns are placed for people

423
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.420
that are heading back from work

424
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.040
and individuals that are trying to find their way

425
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.560
through the darkened evening roads,

426
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.080
eventually finding your way to the exterior

427
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.500
of the Gemmed Hearth Inn.

428
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.700
You look at it.

429
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.980
From the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell it's an inn.

430
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.680
It looks like a warehouse.

431
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.920
It looks like a storage facility.

432
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.870
It's very simple, bland woods.

433
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.130
The mud across the ground

434
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.580
has been spattered and dried

435
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.770
and spattered and dried to the point

436
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.650
where it's just repeatedly caked across the baseboards

437
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.650
of the exterior, about a foot and a half to two feet up,

438
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.430
where it looks like it's slowly being pulled

439
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.050
into the earth.

440
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.750
It might be, who knows?

441
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.530
But the door is partially ajar,

442
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.940
and as you step up to the interior,

443
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.470
the wood creaks beneath your weight with each step,

444
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.820
and the warm interior greets you along

445
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.030
with the combined smell, it seems, of burned meat,

446
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.513
strong, spilled, soured alcohol,

447
00:17:04.513 --> 00:17:06.700
possibly a bit of bile, who knows?

448
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.610
It's a delightful interior.

449
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.760
There's five tables, of which only one

450
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.560
of them has a patron, at the moment.

451
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.600
You see a very, very, very old, folded face of a man.

452
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.450
He is missing all of his teeth,

453
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.350
and his jaw scoops forward

454
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.850
and overlaps the front, a bit.

455
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.800
He's holding a really heavy tankard in front

456
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.560
with both hands, and he's just looking into it.

457
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.800
It looks like he's in the process of either falling asleep

458
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.700
or having the deepest thought you could possibly imagine.

459
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.530
Across the table, in the back, you see a well-polished bar.

460
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.700
It doesn't match the rest of it, and in fact,

461
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.690
you get the sense maybe it had acquired this

462
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.030
curved bar recently

463
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.970
and just has nothing else to update the interior.

464
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.450
It stands out with how well polished it is.

465
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.970
Whether he saved up and bought it, or another place closed,

466
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.500
and he got it in an auction, who knows?

467
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.333
But behind it,

468
00:17:56.333 --> 00:18:01.333
you see the rather rotund, heavyset figure

469
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.830
of a gruff man with strong stubble

470
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.290
across his heavy, square jaw.

471
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.100
His hair is receding in the back,

472
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.070
a Friar Tuck type bald spot,

473
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.570
where he has a bit of a bowl cut around the sides.

474
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.050
He has a series of scars across one side of his face,

475
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.810
minor scars, and one discolored eye on that side,

476
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.440
on his right side.

477
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.220
But he glances up for a bit.

478
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.230
You see him finish polishing the countertop,

479
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.630
more than it needs to be polished.

480
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:32.730
He looks up.

481
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.876
"Hello, can I help you?"

482
00:18:35.876 --> 00:18:37.490
LIAM: Yeah, hello.

483
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.550
It has been a shit of a day,

484
00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.080
and we could all use a drink.

485
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.590
And Caleb places a gold on the countertop.

486
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.390
This should cover a round, yeah?

487
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.560
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, it'll cover a round, no worries."

488
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.410
LIAM: Is it all wine here

489
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.970
because of the proximity to the estate,

490
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.803
or do you have--?

491
00:18:54.803 --> 00:18:56.790
MATT: "Oh, if you want wine, that's
a whole different ballgame."

492
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.730
LIAM: Good, I don't.

493
00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.004
MATT: "Whatever a ballgame is."
LIAM: Whisky, please.

494
00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:00.780
(laughter)

495
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.500
MATT: Goatball, you know, you've seen it around.

496
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.680
It's a big, popular thing

497
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.580
with the goliaths.

498
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.230
TRAVIS: Goatball! (laughs)

499
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.063
TALIESIN: Canon.

500
00:19:09.063 --> 00:19:11.380
MATT: Well, it is, from Campaign 1.

501
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.260
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MARISHA: That's right.

502
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.410
MATT: "I just assumed you were looking for ale, maybe,

503
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.058
"but if you want wine, that's pricey."

504
00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:20.320
LAURA: No, no, no.

505
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.220
LIAM: Nothing in between?

506
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.890
You don't have anything stronger than ale?

507
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.060
Perhaps--

508
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.380
TRAVIS: Whisky, Scotch?

509
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.229
MATT: "Oh, liquor?"

510
00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:28.804
TRAVIS: Yeah.

511
00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:31.270
MATT: "Yeah. How much you want?

512
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.610
"Like just a shot each

513
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.730
"or, like, full thing?"
MARISHA: Just give us a bottle.

514
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.240
Maybe two.

515
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.440
MATT: "You're going to need to put a few more gold on."

516
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.580
LIAM: I turn and I add a platinum.

517
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.413
SAM: Woo!

518
00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:44.770
LAURA: We also want rooms and stuff.

519
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.650
LIAM: Keep it coming.

520
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.860
MARISHA: Yeah, can we have all the rooms?

521
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.210
Do you have any more rooms?

522
00:19:50.618 --> 00:19:53.150
MATT: "I got three rooms."
SAM: Maybe ask how many rooms there are first.

523
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.370
MATT: "If you don't mind sharing.

524
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.680
"I can get you a bottle and get you rooms for the night."

525
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.673
MARISHA: We'll take all the rooms. It's three rooms.

526
00:19:59.673 --> 00:20:01.410
MATT: He reaches over and scoots the coin across

527
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.000
and happily tucks it into a pocket, buttons it shut,

528
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.770
heads off to the back and, for a moment, leaves you alone,

529
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.160
just your troupe and that one old guy

530
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.460
who's been awfully quiet in a darkened chamber.

531
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.450
TRAVIS: What's up, Grandad?

532
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.283
How are things?

533
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.103
MATT: No response.

534
00:20:21.103 --> 00:20:22.220
He doesn't acknowledge.

535
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.648
TRAVIS: (louder) What's up, Granddad!

536
00:20:26.648 --> 00:20:27.740
TALIESIN: I cast Speak with Dead.

537
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.825
I'm just kidding.
(laughter)

538
00:20:30.825 --> 00:20:32.919
SAM: Maybe he's just sleeping.

539
00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:34.270
Maybe he's hard-of-hearing.
ASHLEY: Maybe he wants

540
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.900
to be left alone.
TALIESIN: Maybe he's

541
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.733
not a grandfather.
LAURA: Maybe he's had

542
00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:38.499
a really bad day, too.

543
00:20:38.499 --> 00:20:41.623
TRAVIS: (grumbling)

544
00:20:41.623 --> 00:20:42.641
I walk over to him.

545
00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.030
(laughter)

546
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.924
I do, like, the slow lean-in, field of vision.

547
00:20:49.526 --> 00:20:51.117
MATT: "Hey!"

548
00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:53.276
MARISHA: Oh, that explains it.

549
00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:54.737
TRAVIS: (loudly) How are you?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:20:54.737 --> 00:20:55.989
MATT: "No, please don't do anything!"

551
00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:57.610
TRAVIS: Okay, no, it's not like that.

552
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.420
Enjoy your, enjoy your beverage.

553
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.586
MATT: "I am!"

554
00:21:03.586 --> 00:21:04.501
(laughter)

555
00:21:04.501 --> 00:21:06.240
LAURA: You are really intimidating, Fjord.

556
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.040
SAM: He could hear you.

557
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.000
TRAVIS: I'm a little confused by that exchange.

558
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.230
SAM: He just chose not to listen.

559
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.400
LIAM: He read your lips.

560
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.760
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe he's a lipreader.

561
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.440
LIAM: Do you, do you read lips?

562
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.700
MATT: "What?"

563
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.533
SAM: Okay.

564
00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:21.743
LIAM: That's a mystery solved there.

565
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.990
ASHLEY: You just went up and scared the poor man.

566
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.823
TRAVIS: Yeah.

567
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.890
I have that effect, Yasha.

568
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.210
I don't know if you know.

569
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.920
ASHLEY: Ah, yes, you're very, very scary

570
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.520
and intimidating.
TRAVIS: Terrifying.

571
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.590
LIAM: (loudly) What is the news here in town?

572
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.250
SAM: Oh boy.

573
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.790
LIAM: (louder) The news!

574
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.160
MATT: "The noose?"

575
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.993
LIAM and LAURA: <i>Ja.</i>

576
00:21:41.941 --> 00:21:46.000
MATT: "Well, there hasn't been
a hanging in about four years!"

577
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.370
TALIESIN: Saw that coming.
LAURA: Yeah.

578
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.254
I don't think he would have heard it anyway.

579
00:21:49.254 --> 00:21:50.806
LIAM: (groans)

580
00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:51.639
SAM: The noose.

581
00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:52.472
LAURA: The noose.

582
00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.582
ASHLEY: Do you come here often?
MATT: "Aah!"

583
00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:56.176
(laughter)

584
00:21:56.176 --> 00:21:58.376
ASHLEY: I'm going to not talk to him, because I think

585
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.646
we'll leave it to you guys.
TRAVIS: I think you scared him.

586
00:22:00.646 --> 00:22:04.150
Yeah.

587
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.330
Ask him his name.

588
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.400
ASHLEY: What's your name?

589
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.073
MATT: "What?"

590
00:22:08.073 --> 00:22:10.170
(laughter)

591
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.040
ASHLEY: (louder) Your name?

592
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.537
MATT: "Darmin."

593
00:22:13.537 --> 00:22:15.430
LAURA and ASHLEY: Darmin!

594
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.690
MATT: "What's your name?"

595
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.530
ASHLEY: My name is Yasha.

596
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.180
MATT: "Okay."

597
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.493
He goes back to drinking.

598
00:22:22.493 --> 00:22:23.611
TALIESIN: (laughs)

599
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:24.960
TRAVIS: That was great.

600
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.210
You really got through to him quickly.

601
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.200
ASHLEY: I did, and he gave me his name.

602
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.636
Usually people don't offer that until the next morning.

603
00:22:31.636 --> 00:22:34.090
(laughter)

604
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.923
LAURA: Hey!

605
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.276
ASHLEY: Just kidding.
TRAVIS: Yasha be fucking.

606
00:22:38.276 --> 00:22:41.319
(laughter)

607
00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:42.875
MARISHA: Yasha, she fucks.

608
00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:45.375
(laughter)

609
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.580
MATT: Eventually, a large glass bottle, dark brown in color,

610
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.540
no label--
LIAM: Put it here.

611
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.370
MATT: Just hands it over.

612
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.604
"All right, there you are.

613
00:22:57.604 --> 00:22:59.960
"(sighs) Here's your keys.

614
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.500
"Welcome to the, uh, welcome to the Gemmed Hearth.

615
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.350
"You look familiar."

616
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.752
MARISHA: Nah!

617
00:23:07.752 --> 00:23:08.714
(laughter)

618
00:23:08.714 --> 00:23:11.016
MATT: "All right," turns right
around and goes back to the bar.

619
00:23:11.016 --> 00:23:12.990
(laughter)

620
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.800
LIAM: Did he bring a glass with that bottle,

621
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.633
or is it just the bottle?

622
00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:17.030
MATT: No, just the bottle.
LIAM: Just the bottle?

623
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.050
SAM: Well, if that's a friend of yours,

624
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.870
you should find out what the scuttlebutt is around here.

625
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.120
LAURA: Why?
MARISHA: I don't have friends, dude.

626
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.030
SAM: Well, I would assume if anyone was your friend,

627
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.250
it was the purveyor of whiskies.

628
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.700
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's the same old guy

629
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.520
who's been here for, like, the past 10 years.

630
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.070
TRAVIS: 10 years, right, so he's known you

631
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.669
since you were little bitty?

632
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:43.090
MARISHA: Well, ever since I started sneaking in here, yeah.

633
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.295
TRAVIS: You snuck in here, underage, to grab a drink?

634
00:23:47.313 --> 00:23:49.880
MARISHA: Have you seen this place?

635
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.450
What am I supposed to do?

636
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.283
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's true.

637
00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:53.250
It's true.
LAURA: Draw.

638
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.030
You could draw

639
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.200
or play piano.
TRAVIS: Did you ever steal

640
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.570
or get arrested here?

641
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.240
Have you been kicked out of this establishment before?

642
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.090
MARISHA: Actually, it was back behind this place,

643
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.420
where I was doing the deal that I got busted,

644
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.510
when I was doing the handoff

645
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.260
of my family's wine.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

646
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.520
We are on hallowed ground.

647
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.353
MARISHA: Yeah.

648
00:24:13.353 --> 00:24:14.186
TALIESIN: Is there any art on the wall,

649
00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:16.260
anything interesting, photo, pictures, I mean,

650
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.260
not photographs, obviously, but, like, any carvings, any--

651
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.340
MATT: No carvings.

652
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.450
The walls are surprisingly bare, except for one piece

653
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.240
of, like, a knitted tapestry

654
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.550
that's slightly off-center,

655
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.300
probably someone's first attempt at knitting.

656
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.780
The lines are imperfect.

657
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.880
You look at it, and you find your head tilting to the side

658
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.850
to try and make a balance to it, and it's just, no,

659
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:42.683
it's just poorly made.

660
00:24:42.683 --> 00:24:44.950
TALIESIN: If I unfocus my eyes, do I get a 3-D picture?

661
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.760
(laughter)

662
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.610
ASHLEY: Dolphins!
MATT: You get a 3-D something.

663
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.010
It hurts you to try and contemplate

664
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.520
and make sense of the shape.

665
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.810
TRAVIS: Jester, I want to consult the history stacks

666
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.740
of this place.

667
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.690
You take the ladies' room, I'll take the men's room.

668
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.750
LAURA: You got it.
TRAVIS: All right.

669
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:58.700
We go and we look in

670
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.800
the restroom for anything--
TALIESIN: There's one bathroom.

671
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.170
MATT: There is a singular restroom that is just a hole

672
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.100
in a plank of wood in an attached outhouse.

673
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.010
TRAVIS: This is unexpected.

674
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.220
LIAM: Is Beauregard's name still

675
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.320
in there?
LAURA: This is much smaller

676
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.830
than I expected it to be.
TRAVIS: The smell is incredible.

677
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.850
LAURA: Also, yes, it's very stinky.

678
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.397
TRAVIS: Is there writing on the wall?

679
00:25:17.397 --> 00:25:18.400
MATT: Make a perception check.

680
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.480
SAM: Are you guys in there, together, alone?

681
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.713
LAURA: Are you trying to get me alone, Fjord?

682
00:25:22.713 --> 00:25:24.812
because if you are, this is probably

683
00:25:24.812 --> 00:25:26.730
not the best place to do it.

684
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.110
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

685
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.943
11.

686
00:25:28.943 --> 00:25:31.349
(laughter)

687
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.030
MATT: You don't see any major carvings.

688
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.330
There are some gashes in the wood,

689
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.922
like a fight probably went down in here, at some point.

690
00:25:40.922 --> 00:25:43.120
TRAVIS: (laughs)
LAURA: Oh!

691
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.510
MATT: And that's about all you can find.

692
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.440
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

693
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.370
There's no, like, "come here

694
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.940
"for a good time"-type messages left, unfortunately.

695
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.000
TRAVIS: We could shut the door.

696
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.833
LAURA: You could what?

697
00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:56.010
TRAVIS: We should shut the door.

698
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.678
LAURA: Shut the door?!
TRAVIS: Yeah.

699
00:25:57.678 --> 00:25:59.368
LAURA: Oh, like, get out and shut the door?

700
00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:02.524
TRAVIS: Well, you said-- (laughs).

701
00:26:02.524 --> 00:26:03.467
Yes!

702
00:26:03.467 --> 00:26:07.532
LAURA: Okay, do it.

703
00:26:10.267 --> 00:26:11.574
TRAVIS: All right.

704
00:26:11.574 --> 00:26:13.731
LAURA: (gags)

705
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:15.980
SAM: Hey, guys, back so soon?

706
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.770
How was it, being alone together

707
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.270
in whatever room you were in?

708
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.370
TRAVIS: We were in the privy.

709
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.880
LAURA: It was stinky.

710
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.450
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: Single occupant.

711
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.383
LAURA: And really dark.

712
00:26:27.383 --> 00:26:29.820
SAM: (gasps) Ooh!
LAURA: I know.

713
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.540
SAM: I'll let my imagination run wild.

714
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.510
LIAM: You're going to christen that bottle or what?

715
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.820
MARISHA: Oh yeah, here, cheers.

716
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.240
LIAM: There's no glasses.

717
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.620
MARISHA: Oh!
LIAM: Just the bottle.

718
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, pass it around.

719
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:44.960
MARISHA: Pass it around.

720
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.510
LIAM: Rough day, Beauregard Lionett?

721
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.700
MARISHA: Yeah.

722
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.620
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MARISHA: A day.

723
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.253
LIAM: Gulp.

724
00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.410
MATT: It is strong and it gets the job done.

725
00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.340
You get the sense that liquor's not their specialty here.

726
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.291
This particular abode doesn't have a wide selection.

727
00:27:02.291 --> 00:27:03.783
LIAM: Ah.

728
00:27:03.783 --> 00:27:04.790
MARISHA: (laughs)

729
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.460
MARISHA: Wait, what was that?
TRAVIS: Why are you drinking?

730
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.293
SAM: Just wiped off the top.

731
00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:10.500
LAURA: I'm going to pour some in a little potion bottle.

732
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.333
MATT: Okay.

733
00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:12.790
TRAVIS: Are you going to feed that to Sprinkle later?

734
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.090
LAURA: No, I think it'll make a good paint thinner.

735
00:27:16.581 --> 00:27:17.547
TALIESIN: That's a clever idea.

736
00:27:17.547 --> 00:27:18.620
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a bit rough.

737
00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:21.400
MARISHA: (clears throat)

738
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.182
TRAVIS: Woof, yeah.

739
00:27:24.182 --> 00:27:26.300
LAURA: (laughs)

740
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.760
MARISHA: I actually used to remove nail polish

741
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.480
with the liquor that I got here.

742
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.313
LAURA: See?
TRAVIS: Makes sense.

743
00:27:31.313 --> 00:27:32.445
LAURA: That's what I'm talking about.

744
00:27:32.445 --> 00:27:33.670
MARISHA: It was great.

745
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.850
It's very multipurpose.
TRAVIS: I can feel

746
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.810
the temperature rising.
LAURA: I'm going to go peek

747
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.020
behind that tapestry on the wall.

748
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.853
MATT: Okay.

749
00:27:38.853 --> 00:27:41.245
SAM: Secret tunnels?
LAURA: Anything?

750
00:27:41.245 --> 00:27:43.610
MATT: There's a portion of the wall

751
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.580
that appears darker in color.

752
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.040
SAM: (gasps)
LAURA: Hmm?

753
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.430
TRAVIS: Black mold.

754
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.755
MATT: You get the sense that sometimes moisture

755
00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:54.505
has been held in this tapestry--
SAM: (laughs)

756
00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:56.290
TRAVIS: (groans)
MATT: -- that has affected the wall behind it,

757
00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.510
and the dust from the interior

758
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.210
of the room has lightened the wood around it.

759
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.485
But beyond that, there's no apparent hidden doorway.

760
00:28:04.485 --> 00:28:06.365
It's just old shitty tapestry.
LAURA: I'm going to carve a dick.

761
00:28:06.365 --> 00:28:08.020
MATT: Hmm, you're going to carve a dick?

762
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.930
There's only one person to stop you,

763
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.590
and he is old and looking at his cup still.

764
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.062
LIAM: I'm sure Matt has got--
TALIESIN: Has the barkeep not come back yet?

765
00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:17.770
MATT: Oh no, he's just sitting down.
LIAM: -- so much planned,

766
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.570
and we're like, "I'm going to sniff the shitter,"

767
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.000
and "I'm going to yell at an old man."

768
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.030
(laughter)

769
00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:22.863
MATT: D&amp;D!

770
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.833
TRAVIS: You're right.

771
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:26.182
We've got a long trip ahead of us.

772
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:27.440
We should rest.

773
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.710
TALIESIN: I'm going to go up to the bar.

774
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:30.543
Hey, friend, I'm sorry.

775
00:28:30.543 --> 00:28:31.830
What was your name again?

776
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.807
MATT: "Oh, uh--"

777
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.275
LIAM: (whispering) You shut your green mouth.

778
00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:37.208
TALIESIN: I don't know if we actually asked.

779
00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:38.090
MATT: I don't think you guys actually asked

780
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.890
that yet, hold on there.

781
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.397
TRAVIS: It's not easy being green.

782
00:28:41.397 --> 00:28:44.160
MARISHA: (laughs)

783
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.993
MATT: "Kerry."

784
00:28:44.993 --> 00:28:46.090
TALIESIN: Kerry?
MATT: "Yeah."

785
00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.050
TALIESIN: Can I get something?

786
00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.700
Do you have anything, like, just some juice

787
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.620
or something without alcohol in it?

788
00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.453
MATT: "Let me look."

789
00:28:54.453 --> 00:28:56.700
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Get some for me, Caduceus!

790
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.500
TALIESIN: Get two of whatever you find.

791
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.090
MATT: "Okay, I'll be right back."

792
00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.860
He goes and leaves for a second,

793
00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.360
and he comes back a moment later with a glass.

794
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.130
It looks like a large mason jar

795
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.310
with a little bottleneck at the top,

796
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.980
filled with a milk-like substance.

797
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.290
SAM: "Milk-like substance"?

798
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.640
MATT: "I got some goat milk."

799
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.206
LAURA: Oh, yum.
MATT: "If that works for ya?"

800
00:29:19.206 --> 00:29:20.139
TALIESIN: That'll do it.

801
00:29:20.139 --> 00:29:22.170
MATT: "Okay." Goes ahead and pours it out for ya.

802
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.650
TALIESIN: How long have you been here for,

803
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.960
working in this town?
LAURA: How long has this milk

804
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.210
been here for?

805
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.053
TALIESIN: Hey, that's funny.

806
00:29:28.053 --> 00:29:28.886
MATT: "Where, in Kamordah?"

807
00:29:28.886 --> 00:29:29.940
"I grew up here."

808
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.840
TALIESIN: Really?
MATT: "Yeah.

809
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.790
"You're not from around here.

810
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.300
"I can recognize that already."

811
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.000
TALIESIN: No, first time, we, we--

812
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.633
LAURA: <i>Oui, oui</i>.

813
00:29:38.633 --> 00:29:39.466
TALIESIN: We were looking to--

814
00:29:39.466 --> 00:29:42.120
(laughter)

815
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.610
TALIESIN: Just doing a little digging around.

816
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.700
What do you know about the Lionett family, out of curiosity?

817
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.010
MATT: "Oh they're-- (chuckles)

818
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.970
"They're one of them rich types, living up here,

819
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.120
"on the mountainside, the cliffside, there.

820
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.820
"Bunch of stuck-up pricks, if you ask me,

821
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.550
"but, you know, that's par for the course

822
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.460
"for any of the folks living in that area."

823
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.860
TALIESIN: Well, just had my first meeting with them,

824
00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.840
and yeah, it was a bit rough.
MATT: "Looking for work, are ya?"

825
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.580
TALIESIN: I was looking for a little work, sure.

826
00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.840
MATT: All right, what skillsets ya got?

827
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.430
TALIESIN: Well, we do a lot of things, to be honest.

828
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.020
We're kind of on a job, right now,

829
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.810
but in general--
MATT: "You good with a shovel?"

830
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.610
TALIESIN: Actually, yes, I am.

831
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.210
MATT: "All right, I got a brother
who owns a livery out there.

832
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.650
"He needs someone to shovel the horseshit,

833
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.110
"and it's been hard to fill the space.

834
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.225
"He's got a lot of horses."

835
00:30:28.225 --> 00:30:30.690
TALIESIN: Huh, I mean, there's a lot you can do with that.

836
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.050
Has he ever thought about the resale value of clean manure,

837
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.870
especially if you're trying to grow crops?

838
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.470
Not to throw that off to the side, but anyway--

839
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.550
MATT: "Growing crops here can be a problem if you're not one

840
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.470
"of the particular enclosed farming arrangements,

841
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.830
"in Kamordah, and they already have their endpoint,

842
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:53.460
"but we've asked, but they seem to be pretty taken care of

843
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.010
"in that department."

844
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.320
TALIESIN: Ah, that's a shame.

845
00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.570
LAURA: Why is everything in this bar about poop?

846
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.430
MARISHA: Everything in Kamordah is about poop.

847
00:31:05.773 --> 00:31:07.430
TALIESIN: Yeah, sadly, I don't think it worked out,

848
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.210
but we'll be moving on pretty soon.

849
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.440
I was just sort of curious, after we had a bit

850
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.480
of a weird conversation with him.

851
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.703
MATT: "Yeah, I mean,

852
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.720
"they're not going to hire anyone,

853
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.510
"then their loss, really.

854
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.800
"Bunch of right uptight pricks. Hmmph."

855
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.500
TALIESIN: Bit superstitious, too, I think.

856
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.307
That's my goat's milk, come on.

857
00:31:31.307 --> 00:31:32.420
(laughter)

858
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.620
MARISHA: Oh.

859
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.900
Oh, this is, oh.

860
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.820
TALIESIN: That's just going to
curdle with what you're drinking.

861
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.180
ASHLEY: It's very weird with the whisky.

862
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.700
I wouldn't suggest putting the two together.

863
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.740
MARISHA: Why did they put them in the same jug?

864
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.313
TALIESIN: You're going to have cheese dream because of that.

865
00:31:45.313 --> 00:31:46.197
ASHLEY: What's a cheese dream?

866
00:31:46.197 --> 00:31:48.542
TALIESIN: It's the dreams you have when you have cheese.

867
00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:49.375
Didn't anybody know about this?

868
00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:50.380
ASHLEY: I don't know if I want to know.

869
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.302
LAURA: We should go to sleep.

870
00:31:51.302 --> 00:31:52.730
(laughter)

871
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.638
LIAM: This is almost as good as penis puppets.

872
00:31:54.638 --> 00:31:56.380
(laughter)

873
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.970
TRAVIS: Cheese dreams!

874
00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.010
ASHLEY: I've heard of these.

875
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.500
TALIESIN: It's true.

876
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.132
MATT: You already learned the dangers of whisky milk, so.

877
00:32:02.132 --> 00:32:04.190
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

878
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.310
SAM: Are you okay, Beauregard?

879
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.542
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

880
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.250
SAM: Okay.

881
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:15.250
MARISHA: Surprisingly, better than I thought, actually.

882
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.390
SAM: Will you share a room, tonight?

883
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.080
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we're going to have to.

884
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.740
These are, like, four by eights.

885
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.060
They're horrible.

886
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.893
Yeah.

887
00:32:26.893 --> 00:32:28.470
LAURA: There's three rooms, right?

888
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.888
Yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm!

889
00:32:32.888 --> 00:32:33.823
Hmm?

890
00:32:33.823 --> 00:32:35.068
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

891
00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:35.901
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: All right.

892
00:32:35.901 --> 00:32:36.750
TALIESIN: I just keep coming up with seven.

893
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.450
I don't know how that helps.

894
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.900
LAURA: All right, we're going to go to sleep then.

895
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.733
SAM: Good night.

896
00:32:40.733 --> 00:32:43.330
MATT: Okay, you head to your respective chambers.

897
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.624
They are disappointing.

898
00:32:46.624 --> 00:32:48.476
(laughter)

899
00:32:48.476 --> 00:32:50.520
TRAVIS: Disappointed!

900
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.570
MATT: Each contains two cots that would roughly assemble,

901
00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.950
if put next to each other, to a standard inn bed.

902
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.030
LAURA: Whoa.

903
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.110
MATT: The cushions that are placed upon them,

904
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.950
upon sitting down, are stuffed with possibly cotton,

905
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.070
possibly elements of hay.

906
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.290
Depending on how you prepare it, there are lumpy

907
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.820
and hard bits in the inside.

908
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.620
It's a little bit of a rough space here.

909
00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.650
No windows, so very enclosed, but functional,

910
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.650
and the locks do work, which I think is the important thing.

911
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.220
LIAM: After finally putting the thread all the way

912
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.320
around the room, Caleb just grabs some of the hay

913
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.220
and throws it on the ground and lies down

914
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.870
to bed down on the floor, saying:

915
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.730
Just like the old days.

916
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.210
SAM: Yeah, I'll do the same.

917
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.043
MATT: Okay.

918
00:33:39.098 --> 00:33:41.670
MARISHA: I'm not going to lie, kind of miss this.

919
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.130
It's nice being back in this.

920
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.690
Had some good times in these shit-boxes. (laughs)

921
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.131
LAURA: Wow.
MARISHA: Yeah.

922
00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:49.488
TRAVIS: Oh.

923
00:33:49.488 --> 00:33:50.866
LAURA: (groans)

924
00:33:50.866 --> 00:33:51.716
I'm going to...

925
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.003
What do you--

926
00:33:55.003 --> 00:33:56.300
ASHLEY: I can sleep on the floor.

927
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.167
I'm used to it anyway.

928
00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:01.250
MARISHA: Honestly it's probably safer than the mattresses.

929
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.174
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Really?

930
00:34:02.174 --> 00:34:03.090
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh.

931
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.600
ASHLEY: I feel like, for me, it's weird sleeping

932
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.080
on something that, you know--

933
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.540
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

934
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.520
ASHLEY: I'm too tall for that bed.

935
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.940
MARISHA: I'm immune to poison and disease,

936
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.059
so I'll take the mattresses (laughs).

937
00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:15.972
(laughter)

938
00:34:15.972 --> 00:34:17.547
MATT: Good call.

939
00:34:17.547 --> 00:34:19.029
TALIESIN: Caduceus is sleeping on the floor.

940
00:34:19.029 --> 00:34:20.030
TRAVIS: That's why you're so promiscuous.

941
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.460
LAURA: I lean up against the wall in the corner

942
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.424
and try to fall asleep, sitting up.

943
00:34:24.424 --> 00:34:26.190
MATT: Okay.

944
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:29.370
LIAM: Best reason to be a monk.

945
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.670
TRAVIS: Get that ass.

946
00:34:34.557 --> 00:34:37.090
MATT: All of you find sleep, though at different intervals,

947
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.680
due to levels of comfort, in the rooms

948
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.010
that you've rented for the night.

949
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.420
But nevertheless, sleep does come.

950
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.000
You take your long rest, and in the morning,

951
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.050
begin to awaken, as the heat, the trapped heat

952
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.340
from the interior of these rooms, begins

953
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.018
to get a little musky.

954
00:34:55.018 --> 00:34:56.020
TALIESIN: There's no windows.

955
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.100
I bet it's so rank in these rooms.

956
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.933
LAURA: Ew, people probably

957
00:34:58.933 --> 00:35:01.130
peed in the corner, too.
TALIESIN: It's like a giant gym sock.

958
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.963
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: When they're drunk.

959
00:35:01.963 --> 00:35:03.200
MATT: It's not great.

960
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.033
LAURA: Gross.

961
00:35:04.033 --> 00:35:05.500
MATT: You get the sense they're somewhat cleaned

962
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.270
between people who stay there,

963
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.000
but being there for a night,

964
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.340
you can immediately pick up the gentle history.

965
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.304
LAURA: Ew!

966
00:35:14.304 --> 00:35:15.604
(laughter)

967
00:35:15.604 --> 00:35:16.533
SAM: Gross.
LAURA: Nasty.

968
00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:18.710
LIAM: When Caleb arises, he cantrips a little bit of flame

969
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.475
in his hand and just sort of burns away the--

970
00:35:20.475 --> 00:35:21.308
(laughter)

971
00:35:21.308 --> 00:35:22.940
MATT: Perfect.
LIAM: -- the scent.

972
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.110
MARISHA: Caduceus, does he have any shage?

973
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:25.943
Shage?

974
00:35:25.943 --> 00:35:27.850
LIAM: (like Sean Connery) You got any shage, Caduceus?

975
00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.143
MATT: (like Sean Connery) Going to cleanse
the room of spirits!

976
00:35:30.143 --> 00:35:32.040
(laughter)

977
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.807
MARISHA: Shage for the shnea shnake.

978
00:35:33.807 --> 00:35:36.948
(laughter)

979
00:35:36.948 --> 00:35:38.260
TALIESIN: I got stuff that smells nice in here

980
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.180
that you can burn, yeah.

981
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.430
LAURA: Why don't we just get out?

982
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.700
Why don't we just walk right out of the stinky room?

983
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.470
LAURA: Let's go.
TRAVIS: Pronto.

984
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.163
MATT: All right.

985
00:35:47.163 --> 00:35:51.200
SAM: Are we going to the lady's place?

986
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.650
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: The witch's house

987
00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:54.970
or whatever she is?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

988
00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:55.830
TRAVIS: Old Masqier.

989
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.480
LAURA: We're going to go fuck up a witch.

990
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.930
MARISHA: Yeah, my dad said pretty much
directly north of here,

991
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.755
and then when we start seeing the bramble, thorny patches,

992
00:36:03.755 --> 00:36:04.650
that we're getting close.

993
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.380
TALIESIN: Very much have a conversation, at the very least.

994
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.410
LAURA: No, we need to kill her.

995
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.820
TRAVIS: Isharnai.

996
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.550
TALIESIN: We could do that, too.

997
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.060
That might not help, but we could do that, too.

998
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.893
LAURA: Oh.

999
00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.040
We have to, like, hold her down
and make her break the curse,

1000
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.090
or can we just kill her

1001
00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.840
and make it break the curse?
SAM: Maybe as we walk--

1002
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.390
or ride? Ride, we're riding as far as we can--

1003
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.580
maybe we should come up with a plan.

1004
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.140
Like, are we trying to kill her,

1005
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.460
or is the thing to try to convince her

1006
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.290
to remove the curse, first?

1007
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.460
TRAVIS: I think diplomacy is always smart,

1008
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.090
but I also think our setting

1009
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.530
will determine our strategy, right?

1010
00:36:40.312 --> 00:36:42.230
LIAM: Yes, we are running into unknown territory.

1011
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.290
We don't know the lay of the land around her home,

1012
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.190
so she knows we're coming.

1013
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.023
LAURA: That's true.

1014
00:36:48.023 --> 00:36:50.580
TRAVIS: I mean, didn't your father say he made a deal?

1015
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.420
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, she more or less takes appointments.

1016
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.790
She'll bargain with people.

1017
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.456
TRAVIS: Talking is certainly an option.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

1018
00:36:56.456 --> 00:36:58.800
Maybe we can bargain with her to make her drop the curse.

1019
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.100
SAM: Okay, what do we have to offer?

1020
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.750
LAURA: Oh, like so many things.

1021
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.660
SAM: Money?

1022
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.370
LAURA: Maybe she wants a performance?

1023
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.830
She hasn't got entertainment for a long time, I bet,

1024
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.620
so like a little performance from The Orphan Makers.

1025
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.228
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have a feeling she...

1026
00:37:16.078 --> 00:37:17.494
doesn't want money.

1027
00:37:17.494 --> 00:37:18.870
You know?

1028
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.494
MARISHA: Yasha's right.

1029
00:37:20.494 --> 00:37:21.810
TALIESIN: You live up in the woods like that,

1030
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.240
you got everything you want like that.

1031
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.073
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

1032
00:37:25.073 --> 00:37:26.500
If not money, what?

1033
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.480
MARISHA: My father always claimed that he gambled a part

1034
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.782
of his fortune away.

1035
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.850
TRAVIS: Money?

1036
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:34.790
MARISHA: No, like--

1037
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.930
LAURA: Like luck?
MARISHA: His soul, yeah.

1038
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.440
LAURA: Oh (gasps), maybe that's why he's slightly soulless!

1039
00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.470
MARISHA: Maybe.

1040
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.120
LAURA: Maybe he was normal and cool and stuff, before that,

1041
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.340
and then he became a dick.

1042
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.990
MARISHA: I always wondered what my dad was like before that.

1043
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.320
SAM: Or maybe she hasn't collected yet.

1044
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.873
LAURA: Or that.

1045
00:37:57.523 --> 00:37:59.088
MARISHA: I don't know.

1046
00:37:59.088 --> 00:38:00.060
SAM: Well, we'll find out.

1047
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.840
LAURA: Are we talking about all the stuff on the horses?

1048
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.700
SAM: Yeah, we're moving.

1049
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.387
TRAVIS: We are moving at a quickened pace.

1050
00:38:06.387 --> 00:38:07.220
MARISHA: For the longest time,

1051
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.300
I thought it was just your everyday,

1052
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.940
run-of-the-mill scam artist,

1053
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.110
another fortune-teller just trying to manipulate someone

1054
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.900
into giving them a glimpse into their future.

1055
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.952
LIAM: They are far more common than the genuine article.

1056
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.443
Hmm.

1057
00:38:28.443 --> 00:38:29.990
MARISHA: Plus, I mean, like,

1058
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.160
everything my dad did was so interpretive.

1059
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.390
It's ridiculous.

1060
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.220
SAM: Maybe I shouldn't be the one who talks to this person,

1061
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.880
because I don't know that I could just bargain with her.

1062
00:38:47.128 --> 00:38:49.224
I mean, she's awful.

1063
00:38:49.224 --> 00:38:51.577
I might just want to, you know. (clicks)

1064
00:38:51.577 --> 00:38:53.260
(imitates crossbow firing)

1065
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.610
TRAVIS: Yeah, but, I mean, if this is the same woman

1066
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.630
that made you like that,

1067
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.880
we at least need to see if she recognizes you.

1068
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.713
LAURA: Why?

1069
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.040
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know, if we just kill her,

1070
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.810
then we're obviously limiting our options,

1071
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:08.218
almost right away.

1072
00:39:08.218 --> 00:39:11.190
LIAM: We could shackle her with these.

1073
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.090
They're the mystical shackles

1074
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.740
that we've had for a long time.

1075
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.006
This is a large cucumber.
MARISHA: It's been a while.

1076
00:39:16.006 --> 00:39:16.839
(laughter)

1077
00:39:16.839 --> 00:39:18.092
MATT: ♪ It's been a while ♪

1078
00:39:18.092 --> 00:39:20.966
LAURA: (laughs)

1079
00:39:20.966 --> 00:39:22.035
LIAM: This is a Shake Weight.

1080
00:39:22.035 --> 00:39:24.535
(laughter)

1081
00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:27.520
MATT: The darkest of vestiges.

1082
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.780
LIAM: How do you think I got these 10s right here?

1083
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.220
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1084
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.120
LIAM: Yeah, we could go in.

1085
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.860
She knows that we are coming.

1086
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.120
We could try to weaken her a bit,

1087
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.090
and once she looks like she has been bled some,

1088
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.330
if that can happen,

1089
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.470
one of our speedier types can get up close and (clinking).

1090
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.120
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Then we can ques-chenger, ques--

1091
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.080
Al Swearengen her

1092
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.120
as much as we want.
MARISHA: Man, we're all just nailing it.

1093
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.280
TRAVIS: We have a carbon monoxide
detector in the studio, right?

1094
00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.208
MATT: I certainly hope we do.

1095
00:39:59.208 --> 00:40:02.190
LIAM: We are rehearsed to a T.

1096
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.840
MATT: Good news is if it goes real bad,

1097
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.100
we have a lot of people who can call

1098
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.272
and send the paramedics.

1099
00:40:06.272 --> 00:40:07.470
LAURA: That's true.

1100
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.727
MARISHA: No, they're dead, too.

1101
00:40:09.727 --> 00:40:11.200
MATT: No, I mean them.

1102
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.291
MARISHA: Oh fuck!

1103
00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:14.791
(laughter)

1104
00:40:15.659 --> 00:40:17.742
SAM: If we just start passing out, one at a time,

1105
00:40:17.742 --> 00:40:22.240
on the stream, how long would it take the audience

1106
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.073
to figure out?

1107
00:40:23.073 --> 00:40:24.110
TRAVIS: 25 minutes.

1108
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.820
LIAM: As long as we're complete fuckheads, by the way,

1109
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.422
your shirt is total madness.

1110
00:40:29.422 --> 00:40:31.280
MATT: (laughs) Yep!
LIAM: I can't look at it.

1111
00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.113
TRAVIS: How many layers?

1112
00:40:32.113 --> 00:40:33.780
LIAM: It is giving me Big Bear vibes.

1113
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.700
LAURA: Five!

1114
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.100
MATT: No, like--
TALIESIN: Wow.

1115
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:36.933
TRAVIS: I think it's more than that.

1116
00:40:36.933 --> 00:40:39.460
MATT: Some faces, when they twist, you look kind of funny.

1117
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.720
This is, legitimately,

1118
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.598
the most nightmare fuel I've seen in a while.

1119
00:40:43.598 --> 00:40:45.095
TRAVIS: Yeah, your eyeballs look real--
LIAM: And this one!

1120
00:40:45.095 --> 00:40:48.150
LIAM: This one is bad!
(laughter)

1121
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.180
MATT: Oh god.

1122
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.013
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

1123
00:40:50.013 --> 00:40:52.038
MATT: All right.

1124
00:40:52.038 --> 00:40:55.463
As you guys continue leaving Kamordah

1125
00:40:55.463 --> 00:40:59.450
and begin following into the side-winding trails

1126
00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.940
that head up the cliff side, at the base

1127
00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.090
of the Cyrios Mountains, heading northward,

1128
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.560
the rain still falling around you,

1129
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.100
not as heavy as yesterday, but still cold,

1130
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.031
and soaking through what you are wearing,

1131
00:41:14.031 --> 00:41:16.390
you continue (hooves clopping) going

1132
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:21.080
up the somewhat slick and sometimes steep walkways

1133
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.430
until eventually you crest past the first ridge.

1134
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.720
As you hit the top and look toward the next element,

1135
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.920
it continues down into one

1136
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.170
of the many valleys that lie ahead.

1137
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.920
You can see miles and miles of deep forest

1138
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.610
that coats the mountainsides

1139
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.580
and completely fills the interior bowl

1140
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.570
and valley before you.

1141
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.930
You can see more mountains rising up all around you

1142
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.650
as the Cyrios Mountain range just continues to climb.

1143
00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.310
You can see a little bit to the northwest

1144
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.510
of where you are one mountain that rises above the rest

1145
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.160
with a deep red-orange color

1146
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.770
that you know to be Mount Mentiri,

1147
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:04.560
that is largely believed to be the mountain where the source

1148
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.625
of a lot of the geothermal activity comes from.

1149
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.020
As you all continue the path downward,

1150
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.110
who is leading this?

1151
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.150
Who's at the front of the pack?

1152
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:19.030
Who is the one who is watching the paths

1153
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.760
and guiding you, hopefully,

1154
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.640
in finding the way to your quarry?

1155
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.040
TRAVIS: We're not burning that 6th-level spell, are we?

1156
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.070
LAURA: Well, how long of a travel is it to get there?

1157
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.540
MARISHA: About a day or two?

1158
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.543
A day?

1159
00:42:35.543 --> 00:42:36.500
MATT: Depending on your means of locomotion.

1160
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.470
Your father went by foot, and it took him,

1161
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.770
I'm guessing, about a day and a half, two days.

1162
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.280
LAURA: Um, horses?

1163
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.113
LIAM: Horses.

1164
00:42:46.113 --> 00:42:46.960
TRAVIS: As far as we can go on, anyway.

1165
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.740
LAURA: I can try it, and then I just won't have a big spell.

1166
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.130
MARISHA: Let's wait for a minute, I think.

1167
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.180
LAURA: Okay. I can-- you know what I can do,

1168
00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.300
if we want to take 10 minutes?

1169
00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.133
SAM: What?

1170
00:42:59.133 --> 00:43:02.250
LAURA: I can try to ask the Traveler if he can point us

1171
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.647
in the right direction.

1172
00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:06.447
SAM: Well, isn't he busy getting ready for TC?

1173
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.060
T-Con?

1174
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.000
LAURA: Yeah, but I can try.

1175
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.466
SAM: TravCo?

1176
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.313
Okay, yeah.

1177
00:43:13.313 --> 00:43:15.370
LIAM: You have such an intimate relationship with him.

1178
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.730
LAURA: Well, maybe he's seen this witch.

1179
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.470
MARISHA: Maybe.
LAURA: I haven't asked him.

1180
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:20.303
Have I?

1181
00:43:21.269 --> 00:43:22.360
MATT: I don't believe you have.

1182
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.390
LAURA: I haven't asked him.

1183
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:25.406
SAM: Go ahead.

1184
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:27.466
LAURA: All right.

1185
00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:28.715
LIAM: Whoa!

1186
00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:29.548
MATT: (laughs)

1187
00:43:29.548 --> 00:43:30.925
(hooves clopping)
(laughter)

1188
00:43:30.925 --> 00:43:33.020
LAURA: I hop down off of the horse.

1189
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:33.853
MATT: Okay.

1190
00:43:33.853 --> 00:43:37.762
LAURA: I set up all my statues that I've made of him.

1191
00:43:37.762 --> 00:43:39.050
MATT: Build a little makeshift altar,

1192
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.788
right there on the side of the pathway.

1193
00:43:40.788 --> 00:43:42.240
There's a little alcove on the side of the rock

1194
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.570
where you can easily set them up,

1195
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:45.870
and it looks like it was intentional

1196
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.290
and probably has been there for a while.

1197
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.650
LAURA: This is nice.

1198
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.564
All right, cool, cool, cool.

1199
00:43:49.564 --> 00:43:52.290
I'm going to try to Commune.

1200
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.440
MATT: All right, you're casting Commune, got it, okay.

1201
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.490
LAURA: I get three questions?

1202
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.090
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MATT: You do.

1203
00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:58.923
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1204
00:43:58.923 --> 00:44:00.920
MATT: As you finish arranging them in the circle,

1205
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.850
you sit down, finish part of the spell set-up is you,

1206
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:09.320
even arranging them in a way that is both ascending

1207
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.640
in size and geometrically placed

1208
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.430
that is pleasing to the eye.

1209
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.690
But as you finish the final bits of your incantation,

1210
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.880
you feel your smile grow, and you close your eyes

1211
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.260
and think very, very hard, in the way

1212
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.760
that you do prayer loudly, and all of you guys hear

1213
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.250
what she thinks might be her inside voice,

1214
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.210
but she speaks loudly around you.

1215
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:33.613
LAURA: Traveler, okay, so, um, we're here,

1216
00:44:33.613 --> 00:44:37.360
and I need to talk to you, and I miss you.

1217
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.830
Can you come, that was it.

1218
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.530
Will it be a question if I ask if you could come talk to me?

1219
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.800
Just come talk to me, please.

1220
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.070
Okay, that's not a question.

1221
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.467
We're communing now.

1222
00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:48.967
(laughter)

1223
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:55.180
MATT: As the rain continues to fall around you, the vicinity

1224
00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.438
that you're sitting has been

1225
00:44:59.438 --> 00:45:01.720
getting slightly drier,

1226
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.190
or at least the vicinity

1227
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:07.350
around this little ritual you've set up seems

1228
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:11.350
to have no longer fallen under the rainfall,

1229
00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.580
and there's a moment.

1230
00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.634
It's a momentary reprieve from it.

1231
00:45:14.634 --> 00:45:16.100
As you open your eyes and look up,

1232
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.870
you can see a green cloak blocking the rain

1233
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:19.970
from touching you.

1234
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.697
You see the dark hood shaded over you.

1235
00:45:25.692 --> 00:45:26.893
Are you all watching her do this ritual?

1236
00:45:26.893 --> 00:45:28.409
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and LIAM: Mm-hmm.

1237
00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:30.850
MATT: You see emerge from the stone--

1238
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.753
SAM: What?

1239
00:45:32.753 --> 00:45:35.930
MATT: -- a figure in a green cloak step from outside

1240
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.927
of the mountain and protect her from the rain.

1241
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.240
Looking down towards you,

1242
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.950
you can see just a faint bit of the chin

1243
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.300
from what bit of light is coming through,

1244
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.660
from bouncing off the ground.

1245
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.160
And you see a smile.

1246
00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:59.044
"It seems you called me, my dear."

1247
00:45:59.044 --> 00:46:01.830
LAURA: Yeah, I hope that's okay.

1248
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.000
I tried to talk to you before, and you didn't come,

1249
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.910
so I thought maybe what would be better is

1250
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:11.513
if I actually really set it up.

1251
00:46:11.513 --> 00:46:14.480
MATT: "Well, I've been very busy
setting up for our coming event."

1252
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.030
LAURA: I know, I'm so excited about it.

1253
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.930
MATT: "I'm going to need your help here, soon enough."

1254
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:19.260
LAURA: I bought so much fabric.

1255
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.940
We can make cloaks and outfits for everybody.

1256
00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.773
MATT: "Wonderful."

1257
00:46:23.773 --> 00:46:25.534
LAURA: Right?
TRAVIS: Divine Sense.

1258
00:46:25.534 --> 00:46:26.367
MARISHA: (gasps)
MATT: Okay.

1259
00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:27.810
LAURA: What?
SAM: Divine Sense?

1260
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.560
Ooh!
MATT: Okay, Divine Sense.

1261
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.487
LIAM: Oh shit.

1262
00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:33.370
TRAVIS: On the giant green cloak
that just came out of the rock!

1263
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:34.695
SAM: Oh!

1264
00:46:34.695 --> 00:46:35.528
ASHLEY: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: (reading) "As an action,

1265
00:46:35.528 --> 00:46:37.783
"you can detect good and evil
until the end of your next turn.

1266
00:46:37.783 --> 00:46:39.420
"You can sense anything affected by the Hallow spell

1267
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.420
"or know the location of each celestial, fiend, undead

1268
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.210
"within 60 feet that is not behind total cover."

1269
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:45.250
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I've seen this, right?

1270
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.670
Beau saw him when we were in Asarius.

1271
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.969
MATT: You do not sense anything.

1272
00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:52.080
SAM: Do not sense anything?
MATT: Do not sense anything.

1273
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.980
TRAVIS: So not a celestial, fiend, undead.

1274
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.500
LAURA: That's good.

1275
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.710
SAM: Not good <i>or</i> evil?
TRAVIS: "Or affected

1276
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:58.543
"by the Hallow spell."

1277
00:46:58.543 --> 00:47:00.292
It's just Divine Sense.

1278
00:47:00.292 --> 00:47:01.880
MATT: Let me check the Hallow spell, real fast,

1279
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.093
just double-check.

1280
00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:05.440
I don't remember the specifics of it,

1281
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.480
so I want to make sure.
SAM: Wait, you can sense

1282
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.990
good or evil?
TRAVIS: No, it's just--

1283
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.520
TALIESIN: Specific types of things.

1284
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.670
TRAVIS: You detect good and evil.

1285
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.340
LIAM: The closest maybe would be a celestial,

1286
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.630
but really, if he is a deity, this is Liam talking,

1287
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.060
he's something other than--

1288
00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.030
MATT: Wait, it says anything that--

1289
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:20.650
TRAVIS: It says, "You can sense anything affected

1290
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.500
"by the Hallow spell."

1291
00:47:23.368 --> 00:47:24.201
I don't know what that is.

1292
00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:26.340
MATT: Okay, you do sense something.

1293
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.190
SAM: What does that mean?

1294
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.023
What does that even mean?

1295
00:47:28.023 --> 00:47:29.180
LAURA: What does it mean?
AM: What's a Hallow spell?

1296
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.033
MARISHA: What was that, what was that?

1297
00:47:30.033 --> 00:47:32.590
LAURA: Huh, what was that?

1298
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.423
ASHLEY: What?

1299
00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:35.810
SAM: What's a Hallow spell?

1300
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.940
MATT: You sense a presence that clicks

1301
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.498
into your attention.

1302
00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.210
"What's your question?"

1303
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:49.040
LAURA: Okay, so we're on our way up north

1304
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.920
to go see this, like, witch lady

1305
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.770
who's, like, super, super creepy,

1306
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.780
and she put a curse on Nott.

1307
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.860
MATT: "That's terrible."
LAURA: I know!

1308
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.210
She also fucked with Beau's dad.

1309
00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:02.850
So basically we want to know

1310
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.990
if you know the best way

1311
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:10.980
to, like, get rid of that curse.

1312
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.610
Should we talk to her?

1313
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.195
Should we attack her?

1314
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:18.360
MATT: "As is the nature of such mysteries,

1315
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.917
"I need you to ask me the right kind of question."

1316
00:48:20.917 --> 00:48:23.120
LAURA: (groans)

1317
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.903
This is getting so specific.

1318
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.640
MATT: "Well?"

1319
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:30.290
LAURA: Okay.

1320
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.570
MATT: "I'm bound by incantations."

1321
00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:33.623
LAURA: Oh, really?

1322
00:48:33.623 --> 00:48:34.456
MATT: "Yeah."

1323
00:48:34.456 --> 00:48:35.970
LAURA: Oh, this is not the way I should talk to you then,

1324
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:38.145
because I don't like you being bound.

1325
00:48:39.257 --> 00:48:42.210
MATT: "(sighs)

1326
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:46.300
"Just ask me a proper question, please."

1327
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.120
LAURA: What should I ask him? How should I ask this?

1328
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.000
TALIESIN: I'm not there.

1329
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.630
SAM: Do we hear him speaking, or is it just her?

1330
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.540
MATT: You guys don't hear any conversation,

1331
00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.000
just her side of it.

1332
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.540
SAM: Okay.

1333
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.090
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1334
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.475
To break the curse, do we need to kill her?

1335
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:08.937
SAM: Which curse? She has several curses.

1336
00:49:08.937 --> 00:49:10.310
LAURA: He knows what curse I'm talking about.

1337
00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.880
SAM: <i>I</i> don't know what curse you're talking about.

1338
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.030
LAURA: The you curse!

1339
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.070
MATT: "That is a method."

1340
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:17.600
LAURA: Okay.

1341
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.480
MATT: "Best I can ascertain, but I haven't met the woman."

1342
00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.160
LAURA: Okay, I'm glad you told me that,

1343
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.790
because that was going to be one of my questions.

1344
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.140
MATT: "But such curses, there can be many ways."

1345
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.500
LAURA: Really?

1346
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.202
MATT: "Depends on the curse."
LAURA: Don't answer that.

1347
00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:36.391
(laughter)

1348
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:39.549
TRAVIS: You're taking it all up saying, (incomplete words).

1349
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.040
LAURA: "What is the shortest route to get to her?"

1350
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.827
MATT: The hood curls up a bit, and you see like,

1351
00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:51.810
he puts a finger up in a direction

1352
00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.958
and looking in all, across the path, to all of you, and

1353
00:49:57.983 --> 00:50:00.210
gives a nod to the group

1354
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:04.045
as the attention passes over you and points and goes,

1355
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.090
"I think that might be the path you want to take,"

1356
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.820
and points, from where you're standing,

1357
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.040
you can see it switchbacks a bit and does split

1358
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.750
at some point, halfway down the mountain,

1359
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:20.240
as the trees begin to grow more and more dense.

1360
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.340
In the direction he's pointing,

1361
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.760
it ends up going a little further northwest.

1362
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.593
LAURA: Okay.

1363
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:34.450
Is there anything we can do

1364
00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:37.120
to help prepare ourselves to meet her?

1365
00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.560
MATT: "Yes."
LAURA: Aww!

1366
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.073
MATT: "It's been wonderful."

1367
00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:45.520
LAURA: Oh come on!
(laughter)

1368
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.910
MATT: He pinches the edge of your chin.

1369
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.743
LIAM: Trickster.

1370
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.944
MATT: "Now, I've got to get back to my work."

1371
00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:51.990
LAURA: Oh!
MATT: (wind whipping)

1372
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.750
He vanishes, and you guys watch

1373
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.090
as the cloak swirls, and then this

1374
00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:00.490
dull flash of greenish blue light is gone.

1375
00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.970
LIAM: Caleb, Keen Mind, memorizes the exact path

1376
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.868
in relation to the direction north.

1377
00:51:04.868 --> 00:51:05.707
MATT: Fair enough.

1378
00:51:05.707 --> 00:51:08.220
TRAVIS: Jester, we saw everything!

1379
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.520
SAM: That he's real.

1380
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.190
LAURA: I know he's real.

1381
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:12.630
TRAVIS: But we heard him also.

1382
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.463
That's not--

1383
00:51:13.463 --> 00:51:14.630
LAURA: No, you didn't.
LIAM: No, we didn't.

1384
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:15.463
TRAVIS: Did we not?

1385
00:51:15.463 --> 00:51:19.940
We heard nothing, but we saw so much!

1386
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.835
SAM: It felt like we heard him.

1387
00:51:21.835 --> 00:51:23.395
LAURA: Did you see his mouth moving?

1388
00:51:23.395 --> 00:51:26.510
MARISHA: Did Beau see something in Asarius?

1389
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.343
I'm trying to remember.

1390
00:51:27.343 --> 00:51:28.180
Is Beau the only one

1391
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.640
who's also actually seen Traveler stuff?

1392
00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.473
MATT: I think so, yeah.

1393
00:51:31.473 --> 00:51:32.639
TRAVIS and MARISHA: In the room.

1394
00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:33.497
MARISHA: That's right.

1395
00:51:33.497 --> 00:51:35.310
Remember, when we saw that acolyte guy.

1396
00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:36.185
LAURA: Oh yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1397
00:51:36.185 --> 00:51:37.680
yeah, yeah.
LAURA: That's right.

1398
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.280
SAM: I will say this.

1399
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.339
He's very handsome.
LAURA: Well!

1400
00:51:41.339 --> 00:51:42.250
MARISHA: He was floating cloak.

1401
00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.800
LAURA: You also can't see his face very much.

1402
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.633
LIAM: Yeah, all I saw was a cloak.

1403
00:51:44.633 --> 00:51:46.680
LAURA: You can tell from, like, his posture.
SAM: I could tell from his posture!

1404
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.890
LAURA: And did you see the bottom of his chin?

1405
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:48.880
I saw his chin that time.

1406
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.430
SAM: He held himself with confidence,

1407
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:53.480
the way he sort of pointed and gestured, like a ballerina.

1408
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.230
LAURA: I know, he was very graceful.

1409
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.430
There's this one point where he went like this.

1410
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.850
TRAVIS: He's not <i>that</i> handsome.

1411
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.590
You're just attracted to mystery or something.

1412
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.593
I mean, you barely saw his face.

1413
00:52:01.593 --> 00:52:03.660
SAM: Who isn't attracted to mystery?

1414
00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.940
I mean, yes, of course I am.

1415
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:07.000
TRAVIS: I'm not, no.

1416
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.240
I like very upfront delivery of goods.

1417
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.215
LAURA: Delivery of goods?

1418
00:52:12.215 --> 00:52:15.160
TRAVIS: No, no, no shady biz.

1419
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.144
SAM: I'll say this about you.
MARISHA: (snickers)

1420
00:52:17.144 --> 00:52:20.358
SAM: You were a lot more handsome and attractive

1421
00:52:20.358 --> 00:52:21.949
before we knew everything about you.

1422
00:52:21.949 --> 00:52:24.449
(laughter)

1423
00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.480
When you were a mysterious orphan with mysterious ties

1424
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.660
to a strange water god, that was sexy.

1425
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.694
Now you're just some creeper who--

1426
00:52:36.694 --> 00:52:38.360
MARISHA: What? Nott!

1427
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.270
LIAM: I think it was more the accent, really.

1428
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:41.280
SAM: That, too.
LIAM: Yeah.

1429
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280
SAM: This accent is so plain.
LAURA: What?!

1430
00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.710
TRAVIS: This might be the worst thing anyone's

1431
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:44.543
ever said to me, ever.
LAURA: That's not plain!

1432
00:52:44.543 --> 00:52:46.540
MARISHA: It's insanely harsh.
TRAVIS: And I grew up

1433
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.098
in an orphanage, yeah.

1434
00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:50.270
LAURA: I think your accent now is wonderful.

1435
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.230
LIAM: So do I, but I just have never heard it.

1436
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.590
LAURA: I had heard that other accent plenty, Fjord,

1437
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.010
and I like this one more.

1438
00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:57.853
LIAM: Maybe it's the Menagerie Coast.

1439
00:52:57.853 --> 00:52:59.955
ASHLEY: Have you ever seen a face?

1440
00:52:59.955 --> 00:53:01.163
SAM: I see Fjord all the time,

1441
00:53:01.163 --> 00:53:02.537
but it still doesn't change the fact

1442
00:53:02.537 --> 00:53:04.470
that he's not that attractive.

1443
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.710
LAURA: Fjord, you're very handsome.

1444
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.370
He's very handsome.
MARISHA: Not everyone can be

1445
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.060
a centaur or whatever, okay?

1446
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.400
LAURA: It was not a centaur.

1447
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.250
It was a minotaur.

1448
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.970
SAM: Yeah, I got what she meant.
MARISHA: Whatever!

1449
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.440
LAURA: I saw his face when I was younger,

1450
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.605
but that was when he looked like, you know, younger.

1451
00:53:23.605 --> 00:53:25.580
Then as he started to get older,

1452
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.430
like he stopped showing his face as much,

1453
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.113
so I only know what he looked like as a kid.

1454
00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:34.110
ASHLEY: He was a kid when you met him?

1455
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:34.943
LAURA: Well, yeah.

1456
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.170
ASHLEY: Huh.

1457
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.090
LAURA: He was, like, a couple of years older than me.

1458
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:40.580
SAM: Well, you said that he sort of was

1459
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.910
whatever you needed at the time, right,

1460
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:44.920
like his appearance changes?

1461
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.753
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

1462
00:53:45.753 --> 00:53:46.586
LIAM: Is that what you said?

1463
00:53:46.586 --> 00:53:48.810
LIAM: Old stories are filled with
tales of the gods taking on

1464
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.590
whatever form they want, so.

1465
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:52.570
SAM: I thought you said something like that,

1466
00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:53.550
or maybe I just thought that

1467
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.300
when you were telling us about him.

1468
00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.420
LAURA: Maybe that's what it is.

1469
00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.253
I don't know.

1470
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.200
SAM: Either way, super cool and mysterious.

1471
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.760
LIAM: We know you got a direction.

1472
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.450
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: That way.

1473
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:08.283
Anything else?

1474
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.238
LAURA: You know, he's tricky.

1475
00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:16.600
He told me that killing her would definitely

1476
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.760
take care of the curse.

1477
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.990
SAM: (crossbow loading)

1478
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.540
LAURA: He also made it seem like maybe there were other ways

1479
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.059
to take care of the curse.

1480
00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:23.992
SAM: (crossbow unloading)

1481
00:54:23.992 --> 00:54:27.467
LAURA: But killing her (snaps), solid.

1482
00:54:27.467 --> 00:54:28.775
SAM: (crossbow loading)

1483
00:54:28.775 --> 00:54:30.390
LAURA: Then I tried to ask another question,

1484
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.250
and he just fucked me over,

1485
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.083
but that's okay.
SAM: So wait,

1486
00:54:33.083 --> 00:54:35.650
is he so tricky and trickster-y that, like,

1487
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.480
if he said she's that way,

1488
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.170
he was tricking you?
LAURA: No, no, no,

1489
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:40.620
no, no, no, no.
SAM: Okay, okay.

1490
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.930
LAURA: No.
SAM: Okay.

1491
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:44.211
LIAM: He pulled one over on you, you are saying?

1492
00:54:44.211 --> 00:54:45.940
LAURA: (sighs)

1493
00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.600
You know, that's the first time that, like,

1494
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.220
I mean, I've tried that spell before,

1495
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:55.220
but that's the first time he really, like, stuck to it.

1496
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.120
(groans) Maybe he's becoming more powerful,

1497
00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.270
and he doesn't have time for little spells.

1498
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.510
SAM: Well, let's proceed on.

1499
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.608
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Gather your--

1500
00:55:05.608 --> 00:55:06.740
LAURA: (gasps) Oh!

1501
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.870
I leave one on the rock, so anybody else

1502
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.990
that comes along can pray to him as well.

1503
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.970
MATT: All right.

1504
00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.170
LAURA: I can make so many more.

1505
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.552
I have a lot of paint.

1506
00:55:15.552 --> 00:55:16.860
LIAM: Hiya!

1507
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.760
ASHLEY: Hiya!
(laughter)

1508
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.960
MATT: Getting back on your horse,

1509
00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.000
you make your way down the pathway, over the next few hours,

1510
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.610
until eventually, you see where the path splits,

1511
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:28.940
and the trees grow more and more dense and taller.

1512
00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.640
Taking the path that you were guided to,

1513
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.990
in a northwest direction, by the Traveler,

1514
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:36.600
you begin to make your way underneath the darkened canopy

1515
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.510
of the forest that claims this valley.

1516
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.080
LIAM: We're moving slower now, right, because we're--

1517
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.800
MATT: You have to, yeah.
LIAM: We're on the roots, okay.

1518
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.950
MATT: You're moving faster than a walking pace,

1519
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.850
but not at a full horseback riding pace,

1520
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.580
because the pathway moves,

1521
00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.920
and there are trees in the way.

1522
00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.990
LIAM: I'm going to send Frumpkin
the raven up into the treetops

1523
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.850
to go from branch to branch, occasionally look down

1524
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.520
at myself to make sure I'm not going to fall off,

1525
00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.491
but stay ahead and try to peer ahead, a little bit.

1526
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:04.200
MATT: Who is at the front of this?

1527
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.120
Who is guiding essentially the party

1528
00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.930
through the dangers of the woods?

1529
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:11.420
SAM: Is it survival or perception?

1530
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.760
MATT: Generally, I would say either-or.

1531
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.907
The DC is easier for survival.

1532
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.790
LIAM: And Frumpkin will assist whoever's--

1533
00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:22.120
MARISHA: My survival's okay.

1534
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.420
LAURA: It's okay, mine's okay.

1535
00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.630
SAM: I'm drinking.

1536
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:25.463
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

1537
00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:28.790
MATT: I would say Frumpkin would be its own separate roll,

1538
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:31.350
because it is not actually with them, looking ahead.

1539
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:32.640
TALIESIN: I'll assist then.

1540
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.060
MARISHA: Okay, I'll guide.

1541
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.400
I feel vaguely responsible.

1542
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:40.400
MATT: Okay, you going perception or survival?

1543
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.590
MARISHA: Survival.

1544
00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:43.970
MATT: Okay.

1545
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:45.490
So we're essentially beginning

1546
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:48.170
what is a traveling skill challenge.

1547
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:50.490
So you're taking survival as the first part

1548
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.323
of the skill challenge.

1549
00:56:51.323 --> 00:56:52.240
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Oh!

1550
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.760
TALIESIN: You have advantage, though.

1551
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.990
LAURA: Guidance!

1552
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:59.717
MATT: As part of this journey, you require four victories.

1553
00:56:59.717 --> 00:57:00.940
LAURA: Ooh.

1554
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.950
SAM: Four victories out of how many tries?

1555
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:04.260
We don't know.
MATT: As many tries as you want.

1556
00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.270
SAM: Oh.
MATT: But four victories

1557
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:06.103
to complete your journey.

1558
00:57:06.103 --> 00:57:07.510
For every failure, I roll here,

1559
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:08.660
to see what you encounter.

1560
00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.710
LAURA: Oh!
TRAVIS: Oh, yes!

1561
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:11.750
LAURA: Hot!
LIAM: I don't want

1562
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:12.583
to complicate this.

1563
00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:15.270
Frumpkin comes to my shoulder.
TRAVIS: Here, roll bad!

1564
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.511
MARISHA: I know!

1565
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:18.068
Roll bad!
LIAM: Don't fuck this up

1566
00:57:18.068 --> 00:57:19.452
for us, Marisha!
LAURA: Guidance, Guidance!

1567
00:57:19.452 --> 00:57:20.293
LIAM: Goddamn you!

1568
00:57:20.293 --> 00:57:21.510
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 20.

1569
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:23.160
I'm so sorry.
LAURA: Add a d4, add a d4.

1570
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.520
MARISHA: Oh, plus four.
LIAM: She had a 20.

1571
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.870
MARISHA: Oh wait, plus my d4.

1572
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:26.703
SAM: Wait, she got a 20.

1573
00:57:26.703 --> 00:57:27.930
MARISHA: I got a natural 20.

1574
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:28.763
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

1575
00:57:28.763 --> 00:57:29.630
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we got to see what she rolled.

1576
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:31.300
MARISHA: 25, total.

1577
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.960
MATT: 25.
LAURA: Natural 20 isn't bad.

1578
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.760
LIAM: Because we want low, so we can fight a monster.

1579
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.593
LAURA: Oh!

1580
00:57:35.593 --> 00:57:37.788
TRAVIS: I want that astral dreadnought
to come out and be like,

1581
00:57:37.788 --> 00:57:39.491
"You're inside me!"

1582
00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:42.730
(laughter)

1583
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:46.190
MATT: All righty, so as you continue forward--

1584
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.371
TRAVIS: Beautiful death.

1585
00:57:47.371 --> 00:57:49.130
MATT: Dark wizard music here, sound.

1586
00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.540
Pushing forward for the first leg of this journey,

1587
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:56.260
deep into the overgrowth and dense forest

1588
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.150
that claim the middle of this valley,

1589
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.300
Beauregard keeps a keen eye,

1590
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.690
with Caduceus holding up the rear.

1591
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:03.910
Both eyes ahead, you watch

1592
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.050
as the path curls and turns,

1593
00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:09.200
and there is one element where the path seems

1594
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.390
to become a bit difficult to follow.

1595
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:13.590
The overgrowth has claimed a lot of it.

1596
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:16.050
But your keen eyes combine and manages

1597
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.560
to find the remnants of it.

1598
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.200
After about another hour of travel,

1599
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.610
keeping a very close eye on where you're going,

1600
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:22.920
the trail picks up once more,

1601
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.464
and you prevent yourselves from being lost.

1602
00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:27.270
LAURA: Oh shit.

1603
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.430
MATT: Who would like to take the next leg?

1604
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.220
TALIESIN: I'll take the next leg.
MATT: With whatever skill

1605
00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.410
you think would be appropriate to apply to this journey.

1606
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.070
TALIESIN: Oh, so you would say change off

1607
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:37.240
from survival to something else?

1608
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.073
MATT: You could do survival again,

1609
00:58:38.073 --> 00:58:40.020
but the DC will be higher, this time.

1610
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.410
You can keep doing the same skill,

1611
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.200
but it gets higher.
TALIESIN: I'll take the perception,

1612
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.550
just since we're just seeing if we're going to hit everything.

1613
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.047
I'll do a...

1614
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.843
Or actually, you know what?

1615
00:58:52.843 --> 00:58:53.820
I'll do animal handling.

1616
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.540
I'm going to talk to my horse and let them know:

1617
00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.660
Hey, trail's getting a little rough, so I need you

1618
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.780
to keep a very, very, very close eye on things.

1619
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.800
Things might get a little rough.

1620
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.130
MATT: All right, so leaning into the horse's instincts

1621
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:10.360
to guide you in the proper path away from danger,

1622
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.190
you go ahead and speak to it, pat it gently

1623
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:13.973
and hope that it knows the way. Go ahead.

1624
00:59:13.973 --> 00:59:15.770
TALIESIN: Is anyone assisting, or am I just blind?

1625
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:17.330
TRAVIS: With fucking animal handling?

1626
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:18.280
LAURA: I'm going to assist.

1627
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.510
I'll pat my horse too, and go: Hey, you hear--

1628
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:21.390
TALIESIN: I don't know if it mattered.

1629
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:22.560
LAURA: Do you hear how Caduceus is talking to--

1630
00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.310
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: Okay, I mean.

1631
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:27.530
I'm giving myself Guidance, because what the heck?

1632
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.915
MATT: Okay.

1633
00:59:28.915 --> 00:59:30.920
SAM: I'll tell my horse: Go the right way!

1634
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.770
TALIESIN: That's not too good.

1635
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:32.670
That's good.

1636
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:34.060
Actually, okay, it's--

1637
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.030
LAURA: It's not bad.

1638
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.570
That is not bad.
TALIESIN: 19, 19!

1639
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:38.300
LAURA: 19's good.
MATT: 19, okay.

1640
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.840
TRAVIS: It's not terrible.

1641
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.700
MATT: This deep into the valley,
the horse confidently begins

1642
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.210
to pick up a trot (hooves clopping).

1643
00:59:45.077 --> 00:59:46.150
TALIESIN: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
MATT: You guys keep up

1644
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:49.150
behind it (laughs).

1645
00:59:52.462 --> 00:59:55.045
LAURA: (laughs)

1646
00:59:56.650 --> 01:00:00.630
MATT: The density of the forest grows darker and darker.

1647
01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:04.570
You can feel your horse getting nervous.

1648
01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:08.220
It begins to give exclamation of (snorts)

1649
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.830
and start getting a little strange,

1650
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:11.920
and so it begins to dart off the path a little bit

1651
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.230
towards a clearing, where it feels more comfortable.

1652
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:16.000
As you guys follow suit, you come

1653
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.590
into an open clearing here, in the middle of the day,

1654
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:20.400
the still-clouded sky above,

1655
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.750
but it's a welcome opening to this space,

1656
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:25.583
and as you step out

1657
01:00:25.583 --> 01:00:27.420
into it (hooves clopping).

1658
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.850
MARISHA: Caduceus, is this right?

1659
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.880
LAURA: This is pretty.
TALIESIN: We all right?

1660
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.390
SAM: Caduceus knows the forest.
MATT: You slow

1661
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.480
for a second, a bit, and look around.

1662
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.270
The whole clearing is empty

1663
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.920
of any sort of woodland creatures.

1664
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.130
LAURA: Do we hear any bugs?
LIAM: Hear anything?

1665
01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:41.119
MATT: Make a perception check.

1666
01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:43.270
LIAM: I'm going, too.

1667
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.090
LAURA: Nope, don't hear shit.

1668
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.130
LIAM: 14.

1669
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:48.252
MATT: 14.

1670
01:00:48.252 --> 01:00:52.280
You pick up one quick sound (whooshes).

1671
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.563
Just in the last minute, you glance up
and you can see a branch

1672
01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:57.670
in a tree not far from you bow slightly.

1673
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:58.780
At the end of the branch,

1674
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.463
you see what looks to be a bird perched,

1675
01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:05.030
mostly a bird, kind of a bird.

1676
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.480
You see bird legs grabbing on to it.

1677
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.860
You see wings that have folded.

1678
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.800
You see the feathers are black and matted,

1679
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.050
like they have oil through them.

1680
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.550
They have this shine to them,

1681
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:21.305
like they had pulled themselves out of a tar pit.

1682
01:01:21.305 --> 01:01:24.390
You can see elements dripping (slurps) off the wings

1683
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.680
as they fold and shake and go back into place,

1684
01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.030
but where the torso is, you see

1685
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:32.200
a gray-skinned female humanoid figure

1686
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.350
with long, tattered, red, wild hair

1687
01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:37.020
that goes down to about the mid-back,

1688
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.460
this mane that pulls to the side,

1689
01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.540
and you can see these yellow eyes,

1690
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.940
peering down as it grins.

1691
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.270
It's about 15 feet above you,

1692
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:45.440
and it just stays there and looks at you.

1693
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.350
LAURA: Didn't harpies

1694
01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:47.564
kill our horses?
LIAM: 15 feet above us right now?

1695
01:01:47.564 --> 01:01:49.160
MARISHA: Harpies ate our horses

1696
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.998
when we were Vox Machina.
MATT: About 15 feet above you.

1697
01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.990
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no!

1698
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:53.830
MATT: As you glance up and make eye contact,

1699
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:58.140
it goes (screeches), "You lost, flesh?

1700
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.610
"I ask your purpose (snarls).

1701
01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:04.660
"Despair makes flesh tasty."

1702
01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.530
LAURA: Well, it's good that we're so happy then.

1703
01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.418
SAM: We are very content, yes.

1704
01:02:09.418 --> 01:02:12.272
MATT: "(hisses)

1705
01:02:12.272 --> 01:02:13.472
"Where you go (snarls)?"

1706
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:18.770
SAM: Uh, we're looking for mushrooms in the woods

1707
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:21.310
for our papa.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1708
01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:22.430
"MATT: "Papa?"

1709
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:24.440
LAURA: For dinner, for supper, he sent us looking

1710
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.880
for mushrooms in the woods.
MATT: "(laughs)" And it starts laughing.

1711
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.670
You hear laughter "(laughs)" in the trees around you,

1712
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:33.370
and you glance up and notice now there are numerous

1713
01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:35.230
of these creatures that were perched in the trees

1714
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:39.110
that were just waiting, resting, hunting, who knows?

1715
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.850
But they're there now.

1716
01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:43.560
TRAVIS: We have a meeting with the witch Isharnai.

1717
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.000
Do you know her?
MATT: "(snarls)

1718
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.648
"We know of her.

1719
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.550
"Mean witch."

1720
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.353
TRAVIS: Mean witch.

1721
01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.640
LAURA: Mean witch.
SAM: Witch, she's a witch.

1722
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.548
TRAVIS: Mean, mean.

1723
01:02:56.548 --> 01:02:57.560
MATT: "(snarls)"

1724
01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.860
TALIESIN: Why is she mean?

1725
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.340
MATT: "You'll find out.

1726
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.450
"Or maybe not,"

1727
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:07.460
as she says that, her jaw

1728
01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.580
hangs open a little longer than it should,

1729
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.420
and you see the tongue (slurps) loll out,

1730
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.340
and as it does, this darkened spittle (slurps)

1731
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.460
flings outward and (splats) spatters into the ground,

1732
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.910
about three feet from you.

1733
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:21.800
The horse backs up a bit.

1734
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.530
LAURA: This horse led us here!

1735
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.920
SAM: I'm going to turn invisible.

1736
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.920
LIAM: You wouldn't mind if we had a grievance with her?

1737
01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:36.030
Perhaps there is something we could trade to come through.

1738
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:37.710
MATT: "Trade maybe.

1739
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.010
"What you have to trade?"

1740
01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.410
LIAM: Many things.

1741
01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:43.458
TRAVIS: Hey, Nott, offer yourself up.

1742
01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:45.403
SAM: (through clenched teeth)
I'm invisible.

1743
01:03:45.403 --> 01:03:47.440
(laughter)

1744
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.280
MATT: Nott's horse's saddle is empty.

1745
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:56.110
MARISHA: Hang on, I pull my horse back.

1746
01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:59.080
Nott, get on my horse.

1747
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.190
SAM: Oh, okay.

1748
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.880
I will stealthily switch horses.

1749
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.640
MATT: "What trade?"

1750
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.000
LIAM: Caleb holds up a big glass jar full of boba and says:

1751
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Perhaps you are hungry for something sweet?

1752
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.180
MARISHA: I trot up with the horse

1753
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.900
and add the horse to the offering.

1754
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.220
LAURA: (gasps)

1755
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.580
LIAM: The horse is the sweet part,

1756
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.603
and this is for nutritional value.

1757
01:04:21.603 --> 01:04:23.930
MATT: "What is in?"

1758
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:29.160
LIAM: This is enough to fill your belly for a day,

1759
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.757
and you needn't savage anything.

1760
01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.708
MATT: (squawking)

1761
01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:37.130
You see all the other harpies

1762
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:39.850
in the trees flap down a few branches.

1763
01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.360
They're still above, but they're much closer

1764
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.390
and circling in a bit as the one

1765
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:47.960
that you're talking to, who you can plainly see is larger

1766
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.030
than the others and seems to hold a position of power

1767
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.390
or leadership within this cluster,

1768
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.890
(whooshes) and fly down in your direction,

1769
01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.400
right towards you (whooshes).

1770
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.990
MARISHA: So yays, yays or nays?

1771
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:02.840
No, sorry, keep going, keep going, sorry.

1772
01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.450
MATT: Then (whooshes),

1773
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:07.350
lands (crackles) on the ground in front of you.

1774
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.075
MATT: (clicking) Walks up, right up to the

1775
01:05:10.075 --> 01:05:11.970
front and like--
LIAM: Uncorks it.

1776
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:13.410
MATT: The smell is terrible.

1777
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.570
You've dealt with seafaring harpies.

1778
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:18.280
These are larger and more grotesque,

1779
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.870
both in their hygiene and (sighs),

1780
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:26.390
these are terrifying harpies.

1781
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.370
The teeth are much sharper and jagged,

1782
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:31.520
reminiscent of some of the worst goblin jaws you've seen.

1783
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.510
It seems that their sweat is a thick oil

1784
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.960
that both protects and seeps into their feathers.

1785
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.330
That's why they have that glistening shine to them.

1786
01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:42.080
The sweat has a dark-brown coloration

1787
01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.260
to it, where it looks like they had just been doused

1788
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.400
in oil or blood of some kind, and it just stayed.

1789
01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:49.900
"(snarling)"

1790
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.080
LIAM: Caleb is going to lean down and place the jar

1791
01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.100
into one of the saddlebags of the free horse

1792
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.320
and gives it a little nudge on the tuckus.

1793
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.800
MATT: She goes ahead and heads up to, you leave it open?

1794
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.411
LIAM: Yeah.

1795
01:06:04.411 --> 01:06:06.730
MATT: "(slurping)"

1796
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.190
LIAM: That's, like, nine days worth.

1797
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.440
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1798
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.780
MARISHA: Come on, Caleb.

1799
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.613
LIAM: I kind of want to fail it.

1800
01:06:13.613 --> 01:06:14.736
I kind of want to fight.

1801
01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:16.510
MARISHA: (chuckles) Natural 20.

1802
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.500
LIAM: It's a one.

1803
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.580
TRAVIS: Oh, is it really?
LAURA: No, no?

1804
01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.500
Why would you say that?

1805
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.000
Because you're rolling.

1806
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.895
MATT: (coughing)
LIAM: Got what I wanted.

1807
01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:30.240
MATT: (coughing) And just spits them out,

1808
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.326
and they (splatting) onto the ground and spatter.

1809
01:06:32.326 --> 01:06:34.191
(whooshing)
TALIESIN: We were saving that.

1810
01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:36.980
MATT: "(screeches)"

1811
01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.215
Everyone needs to roll initiative.

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:45.120

All right, move it up here.

1891
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:34.214
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1892
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.700
SAM: Oh boy, here we go, here we go, here we go.

1893
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.724
MATT: So initiative here.

1894
01:09:39.724 --> 01:09:41.020
ASHLEY: (sighs) We haven't done this in a minute.

1895
01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.829
TALIESIN: Yep, been a while.

1896
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:44.180
MARISHA: ♪ It's been a while ♪

1897
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.013
MATT: Oh, okay.

1898
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.060
25 to 20?

1899
01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.890
LAURA: Oh, I didn't even roll, sorry, sorry.

1900
01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:51.723
MARISHA: 23.
MATT: Nice.

SAM: Uh, 2-- nope (laughs).

1902

LAURA: 21.

1903
01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.070
MATT: 21, all right.

1904
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.385
ASHLEY: 22!

1905
01:10:00.385 --> 01:10:01.349
SAM: Yeah!

1906
01:10:01.349 --> 01:10:03.400
SAM: That's that Ashley roll.
LAURA: What, what!

1907
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.630
TRAVIS: Yasha, Jester, Beau, right?

1908
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.060
MATT: Yup.
MARISHA: Beau, Yasha, Jester.

1909
01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:07.893
MATT: 20 to 15?

1910
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:09.583
TALIESIN: 15.

1911
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.660
SAM: N-n-nineteen.

1912
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.310
MATT: 19.

1913
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.950
MARISHA: I rolled a 23. What did you say?

1914
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:16.140
ASHLEY: 22.

1915
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.170
MATT: 15 to 10?

1916
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:18.590
LIAM: 14.

1917
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:22.770
MATT: 14 for-- let's see here.

1918
01:10:23.801 --> 01:10:25.690
TRAVIS: I can't. Already checked out.

1919
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:27.070
MARISHA: What were you?
SAM: N-n-nineteen.

1920
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:29.130
MATT: Then Fjord, a--?
TRAVIS: 12.

1921
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:30.970
MATT: 12, got it, all right.

1922
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.620
So the beginning of the round,

1923
01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.620
Beau, you are up first with Yasha on deck.

1924
01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.650
You can see them now all ready

1925
01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:38.550
to leap off the trees and swarm in.

1926
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.370
MARISHA: So none in range?

1927
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.203
MATT: At the moment, no.

1928
01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:44.596
All you hear is the chorus of screeches all around you.

1929
01:10:44.596 --> 01:10:47.429
(screeching)

1930
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:52.600
MARISHA: I slap Water Closet and I say: Be free!

1931
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.640
and give him a slap on the ass.

1932
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.870
MATT: All right, taking Nott with it.

1933
01:11:00.925 --> 01:11:01.758
MARISHA: No, no.

1934
01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.410
Nott was on mine.

1935
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:04.900
MATT: Oh, you're slapping the one in front.

1936
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.140
MARISHA: The free one that I was offering.

1937
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.510
MATT: Oh, I see, I see.

1938
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:08.343
All right, in which you are invisible,

1939
01:11:08.343 --> 01:11:09.830
so I'll put that little marker there.

1940
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:12.500
MARISHA: Yeah, not that one.
MATT: Okay, sorry.

1941
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.120
Okay, it'll be your action to do that, just as a heads up.

1942
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.230
MARISHA: Oh.
LIAM: Hmm.

1943
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.060
MATT: To reach forward, because you're on horseback,

1944
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.020
to reach forward and slap it enough to send it off,

1945
01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:20.853
that'll be your action.

1946
01:11:20.853 --> 01:11:22.730
MARISHA: Bonus action, Patient Defense.

1947
01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:25.110
That's what I was going to do.
MATT: Okay, got it.

1948
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:27.822
I'll say as part of that, the horse runs off.

1949
01:11:27.822 --> 01:11:30.040
MARISHA: Hopefully, he's a distraction. I don't know.

1950
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:30.960
LAURA: Maybe.
MATT: We'll say at the top,

1951
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.440
so it just swoops and can then use

1952
01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.360
galloping away at the moment.
LAURA: One horse makes it.

1953
01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.920
MATT: Patient Defense with that bonus action.

1954
01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.050
Yasha, you're up first.

1955
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:38.720
Jester, you're on deck.
ASHLEY and LAURA: Okay.

1956
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.354
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.

1957
01:11:40.354 --> 01:11:42.009
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1958
01:11:42.009 --> 01:11:43.109
MATT: You got it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1959
01:11:44.577 --> 01:11:45.467
MARISHA: Beautiful.

1960
01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.146
LIAM: That's like a dot-com.

1961
01:11:47.146 --> 01:11:48.590
ASHLEY: ♪ Dot-Com ♪

1962
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:53.590
Okay, so could I jump off my horse?

1963
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.550
I mean, will that be considered an action,

1964
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:57.460
if I jump off the horse?

1965
01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.880
MATT: No, jumping off would be half your movement.

1966
01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.520
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to jump off the horse

1967
01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:05.520
and start running towards this bitch over here.

1968
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.883
MATT: Here?

1969
01:12:06.883 --> 01:12:08.490
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Two, three.

1970
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.940
You can get right underneath it.

1971
01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.556
ASHLEY: Great.
MATT: It's not within range, though.

1972
01:12:12.556 --> 01:12:13.980
ASHLEY: Not within range?
MATT: No.

1973
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.630
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: It's about 10 feet up.

1974
01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:16.710
ASHLEY: Fuck!

1975
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:19.550
Okay, so I will just--

1976
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.060
I'll just rage and--

1977
01:12:24.883 --> 01:12:26.160
MATT: You can hold your action if you want to.

1978
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.790
ASHLEY: I'll tell it to come down, when it's in range.

1979
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:29.060
MATT: Okay, so when it comes within range,

1980
01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.240
you'll make an attack?
ASHLEY: Yes.

1981
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.073
MATT: You got it.

1982
01:12:31.073 --> 01:12:32.320
All right, that finishes your go.

1983
01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.910
Jester, you're up.

1984
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:36.457
LAURA: I'm going to...

1985
01:12:38.968 --> 01:12:40.101
cast...

1986
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.880
Spiritual Guardians!

1987
01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.750
MATT: Spiritual Guardians, okay.
LAURA: At 5th-level.

1988
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:51.330
MATT: Oh, damn, what's the radius on that, again?

1989
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:54.940
LAURA: That is 15 feet around me.

1990
01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.840
MATT: 15 feet around you, all right.

1991
01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.810
We'll go ahead and put it--

1992
01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:03.810
LAURA: So a array of really buff-looking,

1993
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.430
pink, flying unicorns.

1994
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.730
They're really muscly, because they're 5th-level.

1995
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:10.563
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1996
01:13:10.563 --> 01:13:12.760
LAURA: Some of them have, like, two horns.

1997
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.160
MATT: Nice, nice.
LAURA: Yeah.

1998
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.410
And, like, razor claws

1999
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:18.920
for their hooves.

2000
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.020
MATT: Okay, so with

2001
01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.074
that situated in place.
SAM: Protect everyone or just you?

2002
01:13:22.074 --> 01:13:23.460
LAURA: Anything that enters

2003
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.990
within the 15-foot radius of me gets,

2004
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.240
that I don't designate,

2005
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.160
anybody that's a friend doesn't get attacked.

2006
01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:30.993
MATT: Correct.

2007
01:13:30.993 --> 01:13:34.120
LAURA: They'll take 5d8.

2008
01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.290
MATT: By that rule, you guys would be dead a long time ago.

2009
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:38.123
TALIESIN: Fair.
MATT: All right, so you have that situated.

2010
01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:39.540
Are you going to stay in place, or are you going to try

2011
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.580
and kick your horse to move somewhere?

2012
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.100
I'm going to try to stay within
range of everybody around me,

2013
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.060
to try to give them protection,

2014
01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.140
since I'm in the middle here.

2015
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.590
So I'm going to stay in the middle as much as I can.

2016
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:53.132
I need to move forward

2017
01:13:53.132 --> 01:13:54.040
a little bit.
MATT: Move forward a little bit,

2018
01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.530
probably would be the best way to handle that,

2019
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:58.020
so you move forward, to there, on horseback.

2020
01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:58.920
LAURA: Sure.

2021
01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.980
MATT: All right.

2022
01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.500
Then we'll say you'll put pretty much everybody

2023
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.870
within the radius, with you on top of the horse.

2024
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:06.830
LAURA: Cool.
MATT: Got it.

2025
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:08.890
That finish your turn, Jester?

2026
01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:10.240
LAURA: Yeah, because my bonus is,

2027
01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.550
I don't think I have much of anything.

2028
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.610
MATT: All righty, it is now the gorefeather harpies' turn.

2029
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:17.377
SAM: Fuck.
MARISHA: Gorefeather harpy.

2030
01:14:17.377 --> 01:14:19.170
SAM: Gorefeather!

2031
01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:21.281
The gorefeather harpy invented the internet.

2032
01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:23.677
MARISHA: (laughs)

2033
01:14:23.677 --> 01:14:25.670
MARISHA: That was good.
MATT: This one swoops down here.

2034
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:30.666
This one swoops down here to pincer attack Fjord,

2035
01:14:32.541 --> 01:14:34.380
just outside of the radius of the unicorns.

2036
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.358
LAURA: Sorry, Fjord.

2037
01:14:35.358 --> 01:14:36.581
TRAVIS: It's okay.

2038
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:41.060
MATT: This one here's going to swoop down

2039
01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.570
to attack you, Caduceus.

2040
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.995
This one is going to go swoop down towards you, Yasha.

2041
01:14:47.995 --> 01:14:50.090
This one is going to head in towards Beau.

2042
01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:52.250
Let's say right there.

2043
01:14:54.234 --> 01:14:55.970
MARISHA: What do the guardians do?

2044
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:56.960
MATT: The one that's going after Beau,

2045
01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.300
I think will just touch the radius.

2046
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.690
LAURA: Awesome!

2047
01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:03.160
MATT: Most likely.

2048
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.400
So is it a wisdom save?

2049
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.420
LAURA: Let me see, wisdom save, yes.

2050
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.930
MATT: That is going to be a 10.

2051
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:12.190
LAURA: Woo, failed!

2052
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:16.194
So that is 5d8 radiant damage.
MATT: Roll damage on that.

2053
01:15:16.194 --> 01:15:19.371
MARISHA: Oh fuck!
LAURA: Yeah!

♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

2055

25, 26, 32.

2059
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:40.270
TRAVIS: Damn.
MATT: Woo!

2060
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:43.580
As it swoops in, its claws up in the air,

2061
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.560
going in towards Beauregard, it immediately gets slammed

2062
01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.850
with four of these muscular, screaming unicorns,

2063
01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:52.700
that just rush into it, stabbing with its horns,

2064
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.810
and you see it (screeching) pull back a bit,

2065
01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:59.380
its blood everywhere, mixed in with whatever its oil is.

2066
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.300
It's hurt pretty bad.

2067
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.990
LAURA: I rolled 8d8 instead of 5d8.

2068
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.823
MATT: Okay.

2069
01:16:04.823 --> 01:16:08.350
LAURA: So I'll take the 14, which
was the first four numbers,

2070
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:10.220
then I'm just going to roll the second one again,

2071
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.690
if that's cool.
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2072
01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:14.400
LAURA: Okay, so that's 18 damage.

2073
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.020
MATT: Still hurt, but not as bad as you thought (laughs).

2074
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.370
MARISHA: I just look over my shoulder at Jester.

2075
01:16:21.989 --> 01:16:22.822
Huh.

2076
01:16:22.822 --> 01:16:25.710
MATT: All right, the one that's going towards Caduceus,

2077
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.694
it lands and it gives out a horrifying screech (screeches)

2078
01:16:31.694 --> 01:16:34.330
that echoes out, and all of you feel it piercing your ears.

2079
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:35.506
I need everybody to make a wisdom-saving throw,

2080
01:16:35.506 --> 01:16:38.006
if you please.
SAM: Oh no, oh nos!

2081
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:40.180
Oh noes!

2082
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.440
TRAVIS: 23, natural 20.
MATT: Nice.

2083
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.490
MARISHA: 17.
MATT: Nice.

2084
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.270
LIAM: Natural 20.
MATT: Nice!

2085
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.470
SAM: Natural one.
LAURA: Natural one.

2086
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:51.303
TRAVIS: Whoa!

2087
01:16:51.303 --> 01:16:52.180
MATT: Nott, you are frightened.

2088
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.730
MARISHA: The universe demands balance, man.

2089
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.950
MATT: You are frightened of the one over here, by Caduceus.

2090
01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.040
One?

2091
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.240
You are also frightened.

2092
01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.310
Caduceus?
TALIESIN: 25.

2093
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:10.370
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: 16, all right.

2094
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:12.570
The rest of you manage to resist the effect.

2095
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.630
Those two immediately become filled with fear,

2096
01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:18.000
as its screech tends to pierce your mind

2097
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.650
and your sense of confidence.

2098
01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.180
Knowing it's there and you're being surrounded,

2099
01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.980
you can feel the adrenaline pumping in your system

2100
01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.400
and the urge to just run. It's that one.

2101
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.466
There are two against you, Fjord,

2102
01:17:27.466 --> 01:17:28.360
that both have you flanked.

2103
01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.950
They're going to get advantage on their attacks.

2104
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:30.783
TRAVIS: Okay.

2105
01:17:30.783 --> 01:17:31.657
MATT: The first one,

2106
01:17:31.657 --> 01:17:35.450
(laughs) okay, that's a 13.

2107
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:36.283
TRAVIS: That misses.

2108
01:17:36.283 --> 01:17:38.970
MATT: Yeah, even with advantage, it was a one and a seven.

2109
01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:39.803
TRAVIS: Oh (laughs).

2110
01:17:39.803 --> 01:17:41.740
MATT: The other one, on the opposite end,

2111
01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.770
that's a little better.

2112
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:44.660
That'll be a 24 to hit.
TRAVIS: That hits.

2113
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.827
MATT: That one deals--

2114
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.170
oof, that is 10 points of slashing damage to you.

2115
01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:53.610
TRAVIS: Okay.

2116
01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:55.485
MATT: Then the one attacking you, Beauregard,

2117
01:17:55.485 --> 01:17:58.570
has disadvantage on the strike,
because you did Patient Defense.

2118
01:17:58.570 --> 01:18:00.860
That is going to be another 13 to hit.

2119
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.010
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: Misses (whooshes),

2120
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.680
you duck out of the way on that one.

2121
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.390
MARISHA: Preternatural Counter.

2122
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.120
Preternatural Counter?

2123
01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.000
TRAVIS: Preternatur-- preternatural?

2124
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.160
MARISHA: Perter-nurter.

2125
01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.920
TALIESIN: Preter, preter neutral.

2126
01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.700
MARISHA: Predator.
TRAVIS: Not prenatal.

2127
01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.664
MATT: Preternatural Counter.

2128
01:18:16.664 --> 01:18:18.440
MARISHA: Hurda-der-da-da.
MATT: (laughs)

2129
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.680
ASHLEY: Hurda-der-dah-dirty.

2130
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.620
MATT: I think the effect takes place

2131
01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.540
after you've marked something or analyzed it.

2132
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.360
LIAM: It means you have to pee on it.

2133
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.590
MARISHA: You might be right.
TRAVIS: Pee on stuff more.

2134
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.640
MATT: But next time you do that, you can totally do that.

2135
01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.260
MARISHA: Goddamn it.
MATT: I know.

2136
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.510
Then there's the one attacking you, Yasha.

2137
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:35.343
Natural one.

2138
01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:38.190
They are rolling terrible.
LAURA: Woo!

2139
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:39.860
MATT: All right, that's their turn.

2140
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:40.810
Nott, you're up.

2141
01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:43.063
Caduceus, you're on deck.

2142
01:18:43.063 --> 01:18:43.896
SAM: Because I'm frightened,

2143
01:18:43.896 --> 01:18:45.750
I have disadvantage on attack rolls?

2144
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:46.950
MATT: Correct, and you cannot move closer.

2145
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:49.350
LAURA: Against everything, or
just against that one creature?

2146
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.920
MATT: While you're within sight of it or you can see it,

2147
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.170
you have disadvantage on attack rolls.

2148
01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:54.003
LAURA: Okay.

2149
01:18:54.003 --> 01:18:57.740
SAM: So that negates sneak attack?

2150
01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.790
MATT: Yes, unless their adjacent to somebody.

2151
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:01.870
SAM: Okay.

2152
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.230
MATT: And you cannot move closer to that one.

2153
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:04.700
That is the source of your fear.

2154
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.970
SAM: Then I will yelp

2155
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:12.770
and run away from it,

2156
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.090
towards the mother harpy.

2157
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:17.329
MARISHA: Two stars.
MATT: All righty.

2158
01:19:17.329 --> 01:19:18.162
LAURA: (laughs)

2159
01:19:18.162 --> 01:19:18.995
MATT: How much you want to move to?

2160
01:19:18.995 --> 01:19:20.510
One, two, three.

2161
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:21.800
SAM: Right under the mother harpy.

2162
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.250
MATT: Gotcha, yeah, because you're invisible,

2163
01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:24.310
it doesn't get an attack of opportunity,

2164
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:25.143
doesn't even know you're there.

2165
01:19:25.143 --> 01:19:30.143
SAM: Okay, I can still attack things, just not that one?

2166
01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.493
MATT: Correct.

2167
01:19:31.493 --> 01:19:33.040
SAM: Okay.

2168
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.140
TALIESIN: Technically, Yasha also would've gotten an attack,

2169
01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.640
since she was within--
MATT: That's right.

2170
01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.950
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, yes.

2171
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:39.680
MATT: Go ahead and roll your attack on that guy.

2172
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.513
ASHLEY: Okay.

2173
01:19:43.141 --> 01:19:45.724
TRAVIS: ♪ Enjoy raging ♪

2174
01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.020
ASHLEY: 15.

2175
01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.250
MATT: 15 hits.

2176
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:56.200
Go ahead and roll damage.
ASHLEY: Yes, okay.

2177
01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.283
Let me get all my pieces.

2178
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.900
Ooh, okay, 11, 12, 13.

2179
01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.130
23 points of damage.
MATT: 23 points of damage?

2180
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.020
Ooh!

2181
01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:11.410
You take a hearty chunk out of that harpy.

2182
01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:13.000
Just as it swoops down and strikes towards you,

2183
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.640
you duck out of the way and spin around

2184
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.260
with the momentum and just slam your blade

2185
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.230
into the side of it's back. (pained screech)

2186
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.150
It stumbles to the ground

2187
01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:20.450
and limps forward a few steps,

2188
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:23.420
before (whooshes) it starts getting back up.

2189
01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.080
It's hurt.

2190
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.010
Finishing your turn, Nott.

2191
01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:30.400
SAM: I will take out my crossbow and aim it,

2192
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.250
but I find I'm shaking so much I can't get a true aim,

2193
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.060
so I will spend my action

2194
01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:40.100
and bonus action consuming alcohol.

2195
01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.000
MATT: (laughs) Okay, fair enough.

2196
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.580
So action and bonus action,

2197
01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.930
six seconds of straight chugging,

2198
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.130
that'll make you drunk.

2199
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.963
SAM: Okay.

2200
01:20:49.963 --> 01:20:52.230
MATT: So you shrug off the fear,

2201
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.268
but you're also now drunk.

2202
01:20:53.268 --> 01:20:55.470
(laughs)

2203
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:56.400
TRAVIS: Is that because you were afraid,

2204
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.650
or it does something to add to your fighting?

2205
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.780
SAM: Huh?

2206
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.334
(laughter)

2207
01:21:03.334 --> 01:21:04.490
MATT: It's a character choice, Travis.

2208
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:06.200
SAM: I am now immune to fright.

2209
01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.060
MATT: All right, Caduceus, you're up.

2210
01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.320
Caleb, you're on deck.

2211
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.750
TALIESIN: Just the one thing you can do.

2212
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:12.080
Are you immune to fear?

2213
01:21:13.052 --> 01:21:14.508
No, okay.

2214
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.390
LAURA: Caduceus, it's your turn.

2215
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:19.800
TALIESIN: Oh, it's my-- oh, I'm up, okay.

2216
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.190
MATT: Best way to describe these,

2217
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:23.310
except for the one that Yasha hit, I think most

2218
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:26.220
of these are technically still partially in the air.

2219
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.940
That's how they're striking from up and adjacent,

2220
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.559
except for that one that Yasha was fighting.

2221
01:21:33.559 --> 01:21:35.323
It's off the ground.

2222
01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:36.548
TALIESIN: Okay,

2223
01:21:38.398 --> 01:21:41.648
I like what you did, Jester.

2224
01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:44.590
That was cool, so I'm also going

2225
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:48.756
to cast Spirit Guardians

2226
01:21:48.756 --> 01:21:50.747
at level four.

2227
01:21:50.747 --> 01:21:52.370
MATT: Damn, all righty.

2228
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:53.970
People be liking them guardians.

2229
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.325
TRAVIS: People be liking them guardians.

2230
01:21:58.325 --> 01:22:00.031
TALIESIN: That's true.

2231
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:01.520
LAURA: What do yours look like?

2232
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.980
TALIESIN: Oh, mine are little iridescent beetles

2233
01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.890
and little flying insects.

2234
01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:08.260
It's just that look, and little dragonflies.

2235
01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.060
SAM: Are they complementary color to Jester's?

2236
01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:10.893
LAURA: Well, yeah.

2237
01:22:10.893 --> 01:22:13.220
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, it's all that nice iridescent

2238
01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.390
and oil slick look.
LAURA: Blues and purples and greens and stuff.

2239
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.890
MATT: So they are also swirling around.

2240
01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:20.660
LAURA: I imagine there's at least one red dragonfly, though.

2241
01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.010
TALIESIN: Oh, I would hope so.
LAURA: Okay, good.

2242
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.878
TALIESIN: My god.

2243
01:22:22.878 --> 01:22:23.850
MATT: (sighs) Two clerics in the party.

2244
01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:25.585
Now I need two 15-foot ones.

2245
01:22:25.585 --> 01:22:27.719
(laughter)

2246
01:22:27.719 --> 01:22:31.052
MATT: Let's see if I got something here.

2247
01:22:32.857 --> 01:22:36.100
SAM and LAURA: (singing along to background music)

2248
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:39.310
MATT: Here, since you said iridescent--

2249
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:40.390
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

2250
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:43.010
MATT: I'll go ahead and use this rainbow circle

2251
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.895
to mark that one.

2252
01:22:43.895 --> 01:22:45.408
(cheering)

2253
01:22:45.408 --> 01:22:46.241
MATT: There we go.

2254
01:22:46.241 --> 01:22:47.634
TALIESIN: Everything I've ever wanted.
LAURA: That's perfect!

2255
01:22:47.634 --> 01:22:49.160
MATT: There you go.

2256
01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.720
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Oh good.

2257
01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.870
TALIESIN: So I'm going to I guess use my bonus action

2258
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.200
to tell all the horses to stay in the circle.

2259
01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.982
All of you stay in the circle; it should be okay.

2260
01:22:59.982 --> 01:23:01.420
MATT: All the horses head look (snorts).

2261
01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.400
look back at you, acknowledging.
TALIESIN: We're working on it.

2262
01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.550
TALIESIN: Yeah, since that's my action

2263
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:07.720
and my bonus action,

2264
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.210
yeah, I don't want to step out

2265
01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:11.350
with that one that's next to me, so.

2266
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:12.183
MATT: Okay.

2267
01:23:12.183 --> 01:23:13.670
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got good coverage right now, so.

2268
01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:14.503
MATT: You got it.

2269
01:23:14.503 --> 01:23:15.830
All right, finishing Caduceus' turn--

2270
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:17.760
TALIESIN: The two that are in there
take damage immediately, right?

2271
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.780
MATT: Does it say they take it immediately

2272
01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.550
LAURA: They take it on the top of their turn,

2273
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:22.730
when they enter the circle.

2274
01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:23.940
TALIESIN: Affected creature speed is halved

2275
01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:24.960
in this area, by the way.

2276
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.793
MATT: Correct.

2277
01:23:27.574 --> 01:23:29.470
TALIESIN: Yeah, enters the first time
or starts its turn there.

2278
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:31.530
MATT: Right, so next time, in their turn, they'll take it.

2279
01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.230
All right, Caleb, you're up.

2280
01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:36.000
LIAM: Caleb is rummaging through his pockets as he backs up,

2281
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.990
away from the main harpy, into the horses,

2282
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:42.770
bumps into Jester and says: Oh, are you okay?

2283
01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:43.920
LAURA: Mm-hmm!
LIAM: Instantly turns around

2284
01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.770
and slaps bat shit and sulfur together

2285
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.900
and a Fireball flies up, out of the air,

2286
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.440
and explodes up and behind the main harpy there,

2287
01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.991
level four.
MATT: Right there?

2288
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:54.410
All right.
LAURA: Whoa.

2289
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:56.236
MATT: (explosion)
LAURA: Yeah!

2290
01:23:56.236 --> 01:23:57.490
MATT: It explodes.
LAURA: He used the thingy.

2291
01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:01.599
MATT: The entire vicinity of this open glade

2292
01:24:01.599 --> 01:24:05.260
brightly lights up as fire bursts in the air,

2293
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.350
engulfing this harpy matron you see (whooshes) now fall

2294
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:11.520
about 10 feet before having to catch herself back up

2295
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.660
in the space she was.

2296
01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.690
That is going to be, ooh, that's a bad roll.

2297
01:24:16.847 --> 01:24:20.470
(groans) That is a nine on the dex save.

2298
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:22.200
LIAM: Total of 26.

2299
01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.430
MATT: 26 damage, woo!

2300
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:25.570
Still holding herself in the air,

2301
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:28.230
a bit burned and charred, smoke come emerging,

2302
01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.670
and some of the feathers have curled back,

2303
01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:32.960
edges of them glowing orange, like cinders

2304
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.900
from the Fireball, but still standing there, angrily,

2305
01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.630
now staring in your direction.

2306
01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:39.490
LIAM: I will crouch six inches lower, amongst the horses.

2307
01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:40.670
And that'll be my turn.

2308
01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:41.850
MATT: Fair enough.

2309
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:44.559
It is now the harpy matron's turn.

2310
01:24:44.559 --> 01:24:47.480
LAURA: Oh no.

2311
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.830
SAM: Ca-caw!
MATT: Angrily,

2312
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:51.470
it's going to (whooshes) swoop in

2313
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:55.150
and keep that same height against you.

2314
01:24:57.138 --> 01:24:59.510
We'll say for the purposes of this--

2315
01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.020
LAURA: Does that take 5d8?

2316
01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:01.853
MATT: It does.

2317
01:25:03.069 --> 01:25:05.760
It makes its wisdom save as it comes into the range.

2318
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.230
That is going to be 14.

2319
01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.480
LAURA: Fails.
MATT: Does not succeed.

2320
01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.043
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm!

2321
01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:19.522
LAURA: (counting)

2322
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:22.160
29.

2323
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.980
MATT: 29.
LAURA: That was a much better roll.

2324
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.950
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

2325
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:28.370
MATT: Swoops in and gets assaulted

2326
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:32.330
by the barrage of super, super, super-buff, tiny unicorns.

2327
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:33.480
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2328
01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.610
MATT: Piercing and screaming past,

2329
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:36.920
it takes the damage but continues to push through,

2330
01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.190
eyes on the prize, towards Mr. Caleb there.

2331
01:25:40.087 --> 01:25:42.060
It's going to make two attacks with its claws.

2332
01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.860
First strike.

2333
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.420
It's going to be a 17 to hit.

2334
01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:47.280
LIAM: Shield.

2335
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.320
MATT: Shield, all righty.

2336
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.440
(hums) Shield goes up

2337
01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.350
and deflects the first volley of claws.

2338
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:53.310
The second attack, it's a natural 20.

2339
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:54.420
LAURA: No!
SAM: Oh!

2340
01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.300
TALIESIN: Dispelled!

2341
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.520
SAM: Yes!

2342
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.140
MATT: Because you can do that with your reaction, yup.

2343
01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:58.973
LIAM: Whoa!

2344
01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:02.493
(laughter)

2345
01:26:02.493 --> 01:26:03.560
LAURA: Whoa!

2346
01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.600
MATT: So you suffer nine points of slashing damage, Caleb.

2347
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.433
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

2348
01:26:08.433 --> 01:26:10.941
TRAVIS: That should've been so much worse.

2349
01:26:10.941 --> 01:26:13.641
SAM: (sings "Duel of the Fates")

2350
01:26:13.641 --> 01:26:16.250
MATT: You now see all the unicorns swirling and battering,

2351
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:18.190
and it's right above Caleb,

2352
01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:20.520
taking the hits, but wanting to look intent

2353
01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.660
to try and grab and yank out of that space.

2354
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:24.640
That brings us to Fjord's turn.

2355
01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.490
Fjord, what are you doing?

2356
01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:30.910
TRAVIS: I am going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself.

2357
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:32.207
MATT: Okay, there you go.

2358
01:26:33.098 --> 01:26:35.190
Looking around, the harpies to each side of you,

2359
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.560
scraping and clawing at you,

2360
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.510
and you're trying to shrug them off

2361
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:39.660
and use the blade to deflect it.

2362
01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.500
You put your hand up, touch the front of your chest

2363
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.708
and watch as this heavy set of jagged, spiked ice,

2364
01:26:44.708 --> 01:26:47.210
(whooshes) encases the front of his torso.

2365
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:50.520
You can see freezing mist drifting off

2366
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.040
of his upper torso as the spell takes effect.

2367
01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.440
TRAVIS: 5th-level.
SAM: Ooh!

2368
01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.380
MATT: Yeah, 5th-level, so you have 25 temporary hit points.

2369
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.200
SAM: Oh!
ASHLEY: Dang.

2370
01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.570
TRAVIS: Yes, and that is it.

2371
01:27:01.570 --> 01:27:02.820
MATT: All right, finishing your turn.

2372
01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:03.950
Top of the round, Beau, you're up.

2373
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:04.950
Yasha, you're on deck.

2374
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:06.240
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to go after the one

2375
01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.100
that's right in front of me.

2376
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.540
I'm going to grab it by its beaky face,

2377
01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:11.960
and pop, pop!

2378
01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.850
MATT: Go for it.

2379
01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:14.257
Take your strikes!
ASHLEY: Bob Bob!

2380
01:27:14.257 --> 01:27:15.980
MARISHA: Bob Bob!
TALIESIN: Bob Bob!

2381
01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.000
LAURA: (laughs)

2382
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.327
MARISHA: Bob one and Bob two, ooh!

2383
01:27:19.327 --> 01:27:22.160
Oh, oh my god, those are both 18s, natural 18s,

2384
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.850
so 28 for both of them.

2385
01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:24.800
MATT: Both of them hit.

2386
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.660
LAURA: Bob packs a punch.
ASHLEY: Bob packs a punch.

2387
01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.960
MARISHA: Oh, wait, wait, wait

2388
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.720
wait, wait, wait.
LIAM: Ba-Barbara Ann?

2389
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.553
Yeah.

2390
01:27:33.553 --> 01:27:36.556
MARISHA: ♪ Ba ba Bob, ba Barbara Ann ♪

2391
01:27:36.556 --> 01:27:39.190
ASHLEY: ♪ Ba ba ba ♪

2392
01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:42.390
MARISHA: The first one is 12, total.

2393
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:45.100
The second one is 14, total.

2394
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.698
MATT: So the first two hits.

2395
01:27:46.698 --> 01:27:49.770
(thuds) You see it (screeches) pulls back.

2396
01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:51.440
First, it hits in the torso.

2397
01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.400
The second one actually strikes in the jaw, and some

2398
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.730
of the jagged, spiked teeth go flying off in the side.

2399
01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:58.210
It withdraws for a moment,

2400
01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.040
and then you see it going back in, angrily,

2401
01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:00.873
about to retort.

2402
01:28:00.873 --> 01:28:02.400
You still have your bonus action.

2403
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.960
MARISHA: This one was getting close,

2404
01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.260
after the death unicorns, right?

2405
01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.880
MATT: This one didn't quite make it into the death unicorns.

2406
01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.700
It was the one against Caduceus did.

2407
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.100
This one is just out of the range

2408
01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.680
from where it should be standing.

2409
01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.650
MARISHA: Are the death unicorns still going?

2410
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:16.710
MATT: They're still going.

2411
01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:18.860
MARISHA: Can I grab it by its neck

2412
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.190
and thrust it into the--

2413
01:28:20.190 --> 01:28:22.060
MATT: That would've been your action to attempt that.

2414
01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.360
MARISHA: Ah, fuck, titties, ass.

2415
01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.610
MATT: Bonus action, you still got, but yeah,

2416
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:27.298
that would've been a full action to try and do that.

2417
01:28:27.298 --> 01:28:30.260
ALL: ♪ Titties, ass, ass and titties ♪

2418
01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.832
MATT: Ah, DJ Assault.

2419
01:28:31.832 --> 01:28:33.050
(laughter)

2420
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:34.141
MATT: Thinking of you.

2421
01:28:34.141 --> 01:28:36.510
TALIESIN: Cheers.

2422
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:39.290
MARISHA: Okay, question, if I Extract Aspects

2423
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:40.301
on one of these harpies--

2424
01:28:40.301 --> 01:28:43.050
LIAM: ♪ Extract that ass ♪
MARISHA: ♪ Extract those aspects ♪

2425
01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:44.057
MATT: Does it affect them all? Yes.

2426
01:28:44.057 --> 01:28:44.890
MARISHA: Does it affect them all?

2427
01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:46.750
And then I can Preternatural Counter

2428
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:47.620
any of them?

2429
01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.740
MATT: Yup, and any future ones you encounter.

2430
01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.790
MARISHA: He makes the names.

2431
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:51.623
TRAVIS: I know.

2432
01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:52.970
TRAVIS: Just say (mumbles).

2433
01:28:54.624 --> 01:28:55.457
SAM: (slurring) Preternatural Counter.

2434
01:28:55.457 --> 01:28:56.997
TRAVIS: I feel like you need to
apologize to a few countries.

2435
01:28:56.997 --> 01:28:59.497
(laughter)

2436
01:29:00.667 --> 01:29:01.791
MARISHA: Looking at him--

2437
01:29:01.791 --> 01:29:03.310
LIAM: What does pasteurization have to do with this?

2438
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:04.930
MARISHA: Flurry of Beaus!
LAURA: (laughs)

2439
01:29:04.930 --> 01:29:05.870
MATT: Go for it.

2440
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:06.990
Flurry of Beaus.

2441
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:07.960
(laughs)

2442
01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.793
That never gets old.

2443
01:29:08.793 --> 01:29:10.500
MARISHA: That one's cocked.

2444
01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.190
Oh, both were bad.

2445
01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:14.960
16 and 13.

2446
01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.693
MATT: 16, both hit.

2447
01:29:16.693 --> 01:29:17.526
MARISHA: Really?

2448
01:29:17.526 --> 01:29:18.800
ALL: Ooh!

2449
01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.140
MATT: Not a super high AC

2450
01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:21.460
on these basic--

2451
01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.290
these general gorefeather harpies, not a high AC.

2452
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:25.370
TRAVIS: These basic bishes?

2453
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:27.330
MATT: Yes, if you will, if you will.

2454
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:28.910
MARISHA: 12 for the first one, nope.

2455
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:30.770
TALIESIN: I'm glad that we both went to Spiritual Guardians.

2456
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:31.730
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: No, sorry,

2457
01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:32.900
10 for the first one.

2458
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:37.060
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: And 13,

2459
01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:41.950
five, six, yeah, 13 for the second one.

2460
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:42.890
MATT: Okay, so.

2461
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:46.150
MARISHA: Extract those aspects.

2462
01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:48.630
MATT: So after the two first hits, you pull back

2463
01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:50.490
as one of its claws goes by your face.

2464
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:53.190
You grab the back of its leg, and with your fist,

2465
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:56.380
slam it into its back and hold on to its spine,

2466
01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:59.170
and you let your ki pass into it

2467
01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:01.000
for a second, and as you do, you immediately

2468
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.530
understand a lot of its physical weaknesses

2469
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:06.170
and where the interior of it is.

2470
01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:08.548
They are resistant to necrotic damage.

2471
01:30:08.548 --> 01:30:09.730
MARISHA: Okay.

2472
01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:12.210
MATT: With that, you pull your hand back and also realize,

2473
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:14.620
"Oh man, that spine's pretty brittle."

2474
01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.350
You punch a second time in there,

2475
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.110
and (cracks) you feel it snap

2476
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:20.730
and it (groans) just goes limp in your grasp

2477
01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:22.260
and falls to the ground.
MARISHA: As I'm holding

2478
01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:24.800
the dead turkey, can I turn to the group and say:

2479
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.570
Don't use death magic!

2480
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:27.403
MATT: You got it.

2481
01:30:27.403 --> 01:30:29.751
TRAVIS: Put the pencil down.
LAURA: That's a PSA.

2482
01:30:29.751 --> 01:30:31.355
TRAVIS: Put the pencil down.

2483
01:30:31.355 --> 01:30:33.520
MATT: (laughs)

2484
01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.930
Does that finish your turn, Beau?

2485
01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:35.880
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

2486
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.870
Jester, you're on deck.

2487
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:39.910
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep attacking
the one that's right next to me.

2488
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:40.743
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2489
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.060
TRAVIS: Fuck it up!
ASHLEY: That's cocked.

2490
01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.910
Ooh, okay,

2491
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:49.480
22.

2492
01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.100
MATT: 22 hits.
ASHLEY: Okay.

2493
01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:52.376
TRAVIS: Get it!

2494
01:30:52.376 --> 01:30:54.170
TALIESIN: (dramatic humming)

2495
01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:55.470
ASHLEY: The first hit--
SAM: Nice.

2496
01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.580
ASHLEY: 22 for the first attack.

2497
01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.580
MATT: 22 points of damage, all righty.

2498
01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:04.208
ASHLEY: Second attack,

2499
01:31:06.644 --> 01:31:08.240
oh, that might not hit.

2500
01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.920
Oh no, 14.
MATT: 14 hits.

2501
01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:11.720
ASHLEY: Yay!
MATT: Roll damage a second time.

2502
01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:14.768
ASHLEY: Okay.

2503
01:31:17.484 --> 01:31:19.847
You know what, I'm going to try this

2504
01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:22.053
other thing that I have.

2505
01:31:22.053 --> 01:31:22.886
Where did it go?

2506
01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:27.540
Savage Attacker, where you can--

2507
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.373
MATT: Re-roll the damage die?

2508
01:31:28.373 --> 01:31:29.920
ASHLEY: Once per turn, where you can re-roll the damage,

2509
01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.080
but you can use either total.

2510
01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.913
MATT: Correct.

2511
01:31:32.913 --> 01:31:34.570
ASHLEY: So let me see if I can roll better than that.

2512
01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:36.997
Yes, that was much better.
TALIESIN: (snickers)

2513
01:31:36.997 --> 01:31:38.793
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2514
01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.459
TALIESIN: It certainly couldn't be worse,

2515
01:31:40.459 --> 01:31:41.620
ASHLEY: 20 total!

2516
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:44.260
MATT: 20 total, all right, so after it struck down

2517
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.780
towards you, and you dodged it

2518
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.300
and then sliced it once, last round,

2519
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:48.133
and it fell to the ground,

2520
01:31:48.133 --> 01:31:50.270
it begins (whooshes) getting itself back up.

2521
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:52.340
As that happens, you take the blade, spin it around

2522
01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.858
and jam it into its abdomen.

2523
01:31:53.858 --> 01:31:56.050
(gags) It's still there, holding it.

2524
01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:58.480
Both of its wings folding on it from the impact.

2525
01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.280
You take your foot, press down its own foot

2526
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.800
on the ground, and then arc the blade up

2527
01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.140
and carve it right in half,

2528
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.660
from the belly up, and it splays down the middle

2529
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.280
and flops onto the ground.

2530
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.330
TRAVIS: I need lessons.

2531
01:32:10.330 --> 01:32:12.130
Give me lessons.
ASHLEY: Two down!

2532
01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:13.470
TRAVIS: Did you say tuna?

2533
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:14.303
ASHLEY: Two down!
LAURA: Two down!

2534
01:32:14.303 --> 01:32:15.525
TRAVIS: Oh!
(laughter)

2535
01:32:15.525 --> 01:32:16.800
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Tuna!

2536
01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.228
MATT: Tuna?
LIAM: What is <i>wrong</i> with us?

2537
01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:19.690
LAURA: Tuna!
TALIESIN: Tuna!

2538
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:22.280
TRAVIS: It's a dope battle cry.
TALIESIN: That's her new battle cry.

2539
01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.292
MATT: She's taken a lot of hits.

2540
01:32:23.292 --> 01:32:25.090
ASHLEY: Tuna!
TRAVIS: Salmon!

2541
01:32:25.090 --> 01:32:26.860
MATT: She's still reeling from that pit fight.

2542
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:29.480
All right, so there are two right there

2543
01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:33.490
that are beginning their turn in the circle of Caduceus'.

2544
01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:36.530
One, actually, one that's in both of your guys' radius

2545
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:39.270
and one that's just in Caduceus'.

2546
01:32:40.432 --> 01:32:41.710
Go ahead and roll your damage, Jester.

2547
01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:44.409
TRAVIS: Blowfish!
MARISHA: (laughs)

2548
01:32:44.409 --> 01:32:45.949
MATT: Ah!
MARISHA: You got lucky!

2549
01:32:45.949 --> 01:32:47.647
LIAM: (impacts)

2550
01:32:47.647 --> 01:32:50.755
LAURA: (counting)

2551
01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:52.523
Ooh!

2552
01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.180
26.

2553
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.320
MATT: 26, it did roll a natural 19.

2554
01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.153
LAURA: Okay, so half that.

2555
01:32:58.153 --> 01:33:00.520
MATT: So half that, so it's 13 damage to it.

2556
01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.462
Then, Caduceus, how much damage did your roll?

2557
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.560
TALIESIN: (counting) 22.

2558
01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:11.840
MATT: Okay, both of them failed their saves.

2559
01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:17.780
The one that's been assaulting you gets pummeled

2560
01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.320
with a bunch of unicorns, stabbing

2561
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.200
at its side and neighing.

2562
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.960
As they rush into its side, it rears around

2563
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.180
and tries to scrape them away with its claws

2564
01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:31.070
as this swirling mass of beetles (hums) curls over its body

2565
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.903
and begins--

2566
01:33:31.903 --> 01:33:33.330
TALIESIN: It's like the '90s Mummy movie, yeah.

2567
01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:36.020
MATT: Yeah, it completely obfuscates its torso.

2568
01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:38.180
You hear it screeching within, and as the bugs pull away,

2569
01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:40.250
there's just bones where the torso once was.

2570
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:42.360
And it collapses to the ground.
MARISHA: Yeah, hey, hey!

2571
01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.010
ASHLEY: I got way too excited

2572
01:33:44.010 --> 01:33:45.600
about that reference.
SAM: Tuna!

2573
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.580
TALIESIN: Tuna!
ASHLEY: Yeah!

2574
01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.741
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's the best.

2575
01:33:48.741 --> 01:33:50.780
MATT: The two now focusing on you.

2576
01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:51.940
TALIESIN: Yeah, the other one took the damage.

2577
01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.530
MATT: They did, yeah.

2578
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:54.440
Both with advantage.

2579
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.830
The first one is taking two strikes.

2580
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:58.030
Ooh, holy shit!

2581
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.920
Two natural 20s.

2582
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.600
No joke.

2583
01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.267
LAURA: They get to go before me?
They do get to go before me?

2584
01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.070
MATT: Oh, it was your turn.

2585
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:06.080
That's right, I messed up on that.

2586
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.180
LAURA: That's okay, because I--

2587
01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:08.580
SAM: You keep those 20s.
LAURA: Yeah.

2588
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:09.690
MATT: I'm going to keep them,

2589
01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:11.570
depends on if they can. Sorry.

2590
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:14.610
LAURA: So I wanted to move that direction

2591
01:34:14.610 --> 01:34:17.610
towards the ones attacking Fjord,

2592
01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:20.150
to get them within my 15 feet.

2593
01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:22.860
MATT: Okay, okay, I'll allow that.

2594
01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.693
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

2595
01:34:23.693 --> 01:34:24.670
MATT: And you still have your action.

2596
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:25.870
LAURA: Am I still frightened?

2597
01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:28.430
TALIESIN: That one's dead.

2598
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:29.930
MATT: That one's dead, so you are no longer frightened.

2599
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:34.160
LAURA: Oh wait, would it have been after my turn

2600
01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.276
that he died?
MATT: It would have, yeah.

2601
01:34:35.276 --> 01:34:37.070
LAURA: So I am still frightened.
MATT: So you are still frightened.

2602
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:38.460
So you have to move adjacent to go there.

2603
01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:39.860
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool, so I'll go that direction

2604
01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:42.880
and then spell attacks, I would still get disadvantage

2605
01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.460
on a spell attack?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2606
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.890
LAURA: Okay, so instead of doing a spell,

2607
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:50.890
I'm going to do a Sacred Flame at the matron.

2608
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:52.490
SAM: 9th-level.
MATT: Okay.

2609
01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:56.930
That is a wisdom--?

2610
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.000
LAURA: That's a dexterity save.

2611
01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.210
MATT: Oh, it's a dexterity.

2612
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:00.440
Oh, that's a 17.

2613
01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.520
LAURA: 17 is what she needed.
SAM: Dammit.

2614
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.460
MATT: Yeah, so she (whooshes) darts out of the way.

2615
01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:08.040
All right, so now we go to the harpies' turn.

2616
01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:08.873
LAURA: Yes.

2617
01:35:08.873 --> 01:35:10.860
MATT: Your fear is gone now, because it has died.

2618
01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.530
Those two that are there,

2619
01:35:13.530 --> 01:35:16.920
both get to roll to see if they get hit by your element.

2620
01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:17.753
LAURA: Okay.

2621
01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:20.900
MATT: That would be--

2622
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.230
LAURA: Oh wait, I won't roll again.

2623
01:35:23.230 --> 01:35:24.100
MATT: 17 and a 15.

2624
01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:28.310
LAURA: The 17 saves.
MATT: Okay.

2625
01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:30.490
The 15 fails.

2626
01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:31.323
LAURA: Yes.

2627
01:35:31.323 --> 01:35:33.500
And that was what I rolled before, I'm assuming.

2628
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.000
Do you want to just use the damage

2629
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:35.833
that I did the first time.
MATT: Oh, that's right.

2630
01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:37.120
We'll keep the 26, right?
LAURA: That was a 28.

2631
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:37.953
TRAVIS: Oh.

2632
01:35:37.953 --> 01:35:40.580
MATT: 26.
LAURA: 26, yes.

2633
01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:42.125
TALIESIN: We are alive and caffeinated.

2634
01:35:42.125 --> 01:35:44.510
LAURA: This all makes perfect sense.

2635
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:45.940
MATT: They're both really hurt.

2636
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:49.920
Then there's the one that attacked you twice.

2637
01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:54.640
Dual critical, they're still on my tray

2638
01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:55.473
if you want to see them.

2639
01:35:55.473 --> 01:35:56.306
TALIESIN: I still don't have my reaction back,

2640
01:35:56.306 --> 01:35:57.650
so there's nothing I can do.

2641
01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.410
MATT: Now you've already taken damage, correct?

2642
01:36:01.410 --> 01:36:02.320
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

2643
01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.860
MATT: Okay, so their Smell of Blood ability kicks in,

2644
01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:07.860
so they do an additional bit of damage for each strike.

2645
01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:12.820
So the first one is going to be

2646
01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.030
25 points of slashing damage, for the first strike.

2647
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:22.050
TRAVIS: Okay, he takes 25 points of cold damage off

2648
01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:22.883
of that strike.

2649
01:36:22.883 --> 01:36:26.060
MATT: As the ice bursts, it entirely freezes the harpy.

2650
01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.070
As it strikes you, you go (impacts, shrieks)

2651
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:30.830
falls back and (splats).

2652
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:32.580
TRAVIS: Oh!
MATT: Shatters into the ground, T-1000 style.

2653
01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:35.030
LAURA: All the unicorns around him go, "Yay!"

2654
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:37.372
MARISHA: (laughs) Me, me, me!

2655
01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:40.190
MATT: Actually, it wouldn't gotten its second attack.

2656
01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:44.120
TRAVIS: Because it took away the second attack?

2657
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.170
MATT: There's two attacks each, for this one.

2658
01:36:47.174 --> 01:36:48.680
MARISHA: Have you seen Happy?

2659
01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.731
MATT: So the second actually doesn't happen.

2660
01:36:51.731 --> 01:36:54.154
The other one attacks--
SAM: The Pharrell Williams music video?

2661
01:36:54.154 --> 01:36:56.767
TALIESIN: No, the happy unicorn.
MATT: 18.

2662
01:36:56.767 --> 01:36:57.600
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2663
01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.390
MATT: 23 and 19.

2664
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.800
TRAVIS: They both hit.

2665
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.962
MATT: Okay.

2666
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:11.110
First one does eight points of slashing damage.

2667
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:13.260
It takes--

2668
01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.573
TRAVIS: 25 points.

2669
01:37:14.573 --> 01:37:15.670
MATT: (laughs) It also dies.

2670
01:37:15.670 --> 01:37:16.800
LAURA: Yes!

2671
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.116
SAM: Oh snap!
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's so cool.

2672
01:37:18.116 --> 01:37:19.924
LAURA: Wow!

2673
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.930
TRAVIS: But that is the end of the Armor of Agathys.

2674
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:26.920
MATT: Gotcha.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2675
01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.890
MATT: Okay, so both of them, as they both strike you,

2676
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:31.380
at approximately the same time, you feel the impact,

2677
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.400
and as soon as that hits, the spell ricochets back

2678
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.363
as all the ice off your body sprays,

2679
01:37:36.363 --> 01:37:38.720
(explosion), shooting hundreds of shards

2680
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.660
of icicle-like blades of ice into both of them,

2681
01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.670
and they fall to the ground

2682
01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:44.060
and shatter into a million pieces.

2683
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.690
ASHLEY: Whoa!
MATT: That finishes their go.

2684
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:46.523
Nott, you're up.

2685
01:37:46.523 --> 01:37:49.040
The only standing one right now is the matron

2686
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.250
that's been harrying.

2687
01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.510
LAURA: And you're invisible.

2688
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:54.790
SAM: I will attack her with my crossbow.

2689
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:55.623
MATT: All righty.

2690
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:59.190
SAM: Not the greatest attack.

2691
01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:01.893
Shit.

2692
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.576
Only a 16.
MATT: Hits.

2693
01:38:04.576 --> 01:38:06.020
SAM: Oh!

2694
01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.700
I assume sneak attack?

2695
01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:08.533
MATT: Yes.

2696
01:38:10.538 --> 01:38:12.960
TALIESIN: Whoa!
ASHLEY: Jeez!

2697
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.050
MATT: Rogues.

2698
01:38:14.050 --> 01:38:15.821
SAM: Ah, yeah.

2699
01:38:15.821 --> 01:38:17.400
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah.

2700
01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.400
SAM: 24 plus six is 30, plus I'll do Fury of the Small, 41.

2701
01:38:22.770 --> 01:38:23.603
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2702
01:38:23.603 --> 01:38:26.120
ALL: Yeah!

2703
01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.082
MARISHA: Ass and titties.

2704
01:38:28.082 --> 01:38:30.870
ASHLEY: Ass and titties.
SAM: In my drunken state,

2705
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:35.870
I will stumble, fall down, and it'll accidentally shoot.

2706
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.898
(laughter)

2707
01:38:37.898 --> 01:38:39.000
ASHLEY: Yes!

2708
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:39.833
MATT: Perfect!

2709
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:43.750
As you do so, the Invisibility fades,

2710
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.308
right as you're mid-fall.

2711
01:38:45.308 --> 01:38:46.340
SAM: Ah!

2712
01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.390
MATT: As you do (twangs), takes off.

2713
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:50.870
The gorefeather harpy matron, who's currently

2714
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:53.260
in the process of about to sink its claws

2715
01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.630
into the eyes of Caleb, who's rushing

2716
01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:58.400
and looking behind, just as it swoops down (snarls),

2717
01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.210
large, heaping claws are ready to just carve

2718
01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:03.490
into its face, hears the "oh!"

2719
01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:05.440
It glances over the shoulder,

2720
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.501
and from the perspective of the bolt,

2721
01:39:07.501 --> 01:39:11.400
(screams) and goes right in under the jaw

2722
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.690
and emerges most of the way

2723
01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:13.523
through the other side of the head.

2724
01:39:13.523 --> 01:39:14.356
SAM: It's a unicorn!

2725
01:39:14.356 --> 01:39:16.855
MATT: This eye gets pushed a little out of the socket,

2726
01:39:16.855 --> 01:39:18.320
from the pressure behind the bolt.

2727
01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.181
TRAVIS: Mission: Impossible III.

2728
01:39:19.181 --> 01:39:23.620
MATT: It (whooshes) instinctually tries to fly,

2729
01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.340
gets about five feet before it arcs

2730
01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:27.520
and (thuds).
LIAM: Now it's sad.

2731
01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.542
MATT: Tumbles onto the ground.

2732
01:39:28.542 --> 01:39:30.790
TALIESIN: Like an off-balance kite with the string.

2733
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:32.780
No, no, no!

2734
01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:33.880
LIAM: And stay down!

2735
01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.350
(laughter)

2736
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:36.830
SAM: Did I hit it?

2737
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:38.820
LAURA: Yay!

2738
01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.360
TALIESIN: I mean--

2739
01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.010
MARISHA: Like a fail video from Texas.

2740
01:39:42.898 --> 01:39:43.731
Whoa!

2741
01:39:43.731 --> 01:39:45.443
LIAM: (ricochet pinging)

2742
01:39:45.443 --> 01:39:48.900
LAURA: (stuttering) That went pretty well, right?

2743
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.160
TALIESIN: Yeah, come back, come back, WC, everything's okay.

2744
01:39:53.906 --> 01:39:54.800
I think it's all done.

2745
01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.633
We're good.

2746
01:39:55.633 --> 01:39:57.070
LAURA: Does the horse stop?

2747
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:58.633
MATT: The horse eventually does stop.

2748
01:39:58.633 --> 01:40:00.062
LAURA: (laughs)

2749
01:40:00.062 --> 01:40:02.450
It takes a moment--
MARISHA: We got him back!

2750
01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:03.680
MATT: A moment to find the horse.

2751
01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.240
But you do manage to retrieve him.

2752
01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.290
LAURA: All right, all right.

2753
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:10.417
How many successes did we get before, just two?

2754
01:40:10.417 --> 01:40:11.700
No, that was a failure.

2755
01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.471
MATT: One success and one failure.

2756
01:40:13.471 --> 01:40:14.670
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

2757
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:16.728
SAM: Oh god, it's a long road ahead.

2758
01:40:16.728 --> 01:40:19.544
MATT: So your horses regathered
and pushing forward into the

2759
01:40:19.544 --> 01:40:21.885
next length of this journey,

2760
01:40:21.885 --> 01:40:23.760
you're now in the middle of the first valley

2761
01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.330
and making your way up the next path

2762
01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:28.070
in the northwestern direction,
over the next mountain ridge.

2763
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:31.167
Who is helming this next leg of the journey?

2764
01:40:31.167 --> 01:40:32.490
LAURA: I'll do it.

2765
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:34.360
MATT: Okay, how would you like to help

2766
01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.400
and aid the travel, at this portion?

2767
01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.533
LAURA: I'm assuming Sleight of Hand and...

2768
01:40:41.666 --> 01:40:43.220
Medicine don't really help much.

2769
01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.710
MATT: If you can come up with a very creative way,

2770
01:40:44.710 --> 01:40:47.200
you can attempt with a very high DC.

2771
01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.760
LAURA: Nope, I'm just going to use Perception.

2772
01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.800
MATT: Okay.

2773
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.466
TALIESIN: Oh, you don't need me.
You can do your own.

2774
01:40:52.466 --> 01:40:54.100
LAURA: No, yeah, I'm going to guide myself,

2775
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.550
but does anyone want to help me keep an eye out?

2776
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:57.600
Anyone?

2777
01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.325
ASHLEY: I'll help.
LAURA: Okay.

2778
01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:01.566
MATT: All right.
LAURA: All right.

2779
01:41:01.566 --> 01:41:03.841
(laughter)

2780
01:41:04.762 --> 01:41:05.753
LIAM: Gentle giant.

2781
01:41:05.753 --> 01:41:07.165
SAM: Oh, oh, good, good.
TALIESIN: Hey!

2782
01:41:08.275 --> 01:41:09.408
ASHLEY: (low voice) Okay.

2783
01:41:09.408 --> 01:41:11.000
LAURA: 21.

2784
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.592
TRAVIS: ♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪
ASHLEY: ♪ Green Giant ♪

2785
01:41:12.592 --> 01:41:14.142
LAURA: Where's the four? Thank you.

2786
01:41:14.142 --> 01:41:16.575
21 plus four, 25.

2787
01:41:16.575 --> 01:41:18.630
MATT: 25, all right, this is the second success.

2788
01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:19.520
SAM: Yes!

2789
01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.370
MATT: Aiding yourself up through
this portion of the forest,

2790
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:24.900
you eventually, with Jester's guidance,

2791
01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:27.290
find your way up to the
next mountain crest.

2792
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:31.670
This one getting slowly
closer towards Mount Mentiri.

2793
01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:32.503
As you hit the edge,

2794
01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:35.380
you can see the bright-red
mountain a little ways ahead.

2795
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:37.360
This next valley below
that you'll have to traverse,

2796
01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.610
that is the safest route
you can take, is much wider

2797
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:41.610
than the one you just went through

2798
01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:44.580
and will eventually lead
towards the base of Mount Mentiri.

2799
01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:48.230
The forest here is spotted from this distance,

2800
01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:49.710
you can see, from the daylight.

2801
01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:52.268
You're about mid-afternoon, at this point.

2802
01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:56.720
You can see there are elements
where the canopies break,

2803
01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.600
and it's hard to see what's below them.

2804
01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.350
The tree colors and the various elements

2805
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:06.890
of the foliage seems to transition.

2806
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:09.950
You also notice that
a heavy fog is settled

2807
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:12.620
over elements of the mountains,

2808
01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.050
the further down you head into it,

2809
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:15.790
and the very, very tops of some of the trees,

2810
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:20.230
at the base of the valley,
are mostly obscured by this fog.

2811
01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:23.535
You're able to just make out the distant

2812
01:42:23.535 --> 01:42:26.027
dark shadows of where the treetops are.

2813
01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:30.360
So you continue down, slowly making your way

2814
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.440
through the next element of the dense forest.

2815
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.170
Who's helming this next leg of the journey?

2816
01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:35.198
LIAM: I'll do it.

2817
01:42:35.198 --> 01:42:36.300
MATT: Okay.

2818
01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:40.457
LIAM: I will send Frumpkin into the air to fly low,

2819
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.990
out a good quarter of a mile ahead of us to see

2820
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:46.400
if there is anything dangerous.

2821
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.908
MATT: Okay, so Frumpkin is utilizing Perception?

2822
01:42:48.908 --> 01:42:49.753
LIAM: Yeah.

2823
01:42:49.753 --> 01:42:52.970
MATT: Okay, so as you guys
are following Frumpkin's lead,

2824
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:56.513
heading down this trail
and path deep into the forest,

2825
01:42:56.513 --> 01:42:57.638
go ahead and roll perception for me.

2826
01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.358
LAURA: I can't Guidance you
on the Frumpkin roll?

2827
01:42:59.358 --> 01:43:00.625
MATT: Unfortunately, no.
LAURA: Okay.

2828
01:43:00.625 --> 01:43:01.980
LIAM: Please be a good roll, for once.

2829
01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:03.426
No, that's a two.

2830
01:43:03.426 --> 01:43:05.018
It's a three.

2831
01:43:05.018 --> 01:43:06.920
ASHLEY: Wait, don't you need assistance?

2832
01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.140
LAURA: Not with Frumpkin.

2833
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.570
LIAM: Frumpkin's way far away.
ASHLEY: Frumpkin is your assistant.

2834
01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:11.403
Okay.

2835
01:43:11.403 --> 01:43:13.270
MATT: You guys contin--
LIAM: It's foggy.

2836
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:14.493
(laughing)

2837
01:43:14.493 --> 01:43:16.290
MATT: It is foggy.

2838
01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:19.740
As you head into the next
leg of this dense forest,

2839
01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:22.400
the fog begins to make it
difficult to see more

2840
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.060
than 20 or so feet ahead
of you, beyond just the shapes

2841
01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:27.500
of trees slowly emerging from the mist.

2842
01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:30.380
Following Frumpkin's lead

2843
01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:31.740
and the communication you guys have

2844
01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:34.330
whenever Frumpkin circle
back over on your path,

2845
01:43:34.330 --> 01:43:35.780
you continue pushing forward.

2846
01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:38.680
The smell begins to change,

2847
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:43.400
as that that really strong,
earthy dirt-scent

2848
01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.280
that mingles with that
familiar sulfurous smell

2849
01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.460
that a lot of Kamordah's atmosphere holds,

2850
01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:51.520
and it lingers.

2851
01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.310
It's on your clothes, and you can smell it

2852
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:54.143
since you left the town.

2853
01:43:54.143 --> 01:43:55.850
It just sticks to you clothes.

2854
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:57.760
But now it's all around you, once more.

2855
01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.392
As you're watching Frumpkin fly overhead,

2856
01:44:00.392 --> 01:44:01.725
you hear a--

2857
01:44:01.725 --> 01:44:04.230
(popping)

2858
01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:06.240
And you look down, and there is

2859
01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.989
an open spring or a jet of a hot spring--

2860
01:44:10.989 --> 01:44:12.390
LAURA: (gasps)
MATT: --right next to you guys.

2861
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:17.060
That (hisses) sprays a massive geyser

2862
01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:21.830
of scalding hot mineral water all over the entirety

2863
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:22.663
of your party.

2864
01:44:22.663 --> 01:44:24.350
I need everybody to go ahead

2865
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:26.304
and make a dexterity saving throw for me, please.

2866
01:44:26.304 --> 01:44:27.290
MARISHA: Oh boy!

2867
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:29.590
LIAM: Caleb was blind and
deaf when that happened.

2868
01:44:30.587 --> 01:44:32.560
SAM: So probably not a good save.

2869
01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.393
LIAM: No.

2870
01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:34.670
TALIESIN: Dexterity.

2871
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:36.090
LIAM: Oh, I succeeded.
TRAVIS: 10.

2872
01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:39.500
MARISHA: 22.

2873
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.860
MATT: Okay, so for a 10,

2874
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:45.040
the mineral water splashes on you,

2875
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:47.310
and it's not mineral water.

2876
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:52.310
Not only is it hot, it begins
to eat away at your skin.

2877
01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:55.750
You take 15 points of acid damage.

2878
01:44:55.750 --> 01:45:00.350
Beauregard, you take six points of acid damage,

2879
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:01.719
or seven points of acids of damage.

2880
01:45:01.719 --> 01:45:02.880
MARISHA: Ouch.

2881
01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.880
LIAM: I rolled an eight, but the
Ring of Evasion saves my bacon.

2882
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:07.748
MATT: Okay, so you're--

2883
01:45:07.748 --> 01:45:10.040
LIAM: Using a slot for it, yeah.

2884
01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.248
MARISHA: Oh, can I evade?

2885
01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.000
If I succeed, can I evade?

2886
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:15.833
MATT: For half damage?

2887
01:45:15.833 --> 01:45:17.830
Remind me of the wording on that.

2888
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:19.230
MARISHA: Success, no damage.

2889
01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:20.860
If you fail, it's half damage.

2890
01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:23.302
MATT: Right.
MARISHA: Am I allowed to evade here?

2891
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:26.670
MATT: Yeah, so you would take none.

2892
01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:28.520
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: You would.

2893
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.660
MARISHA: Awesome.
MATT: So, Caleb, you go ahead and

2894
01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.785
take seven points of acid damage.

2895
01:45:31.785 --> 01:45:33.017
Nott, what'd you get?

2896
01:45:33.017 --> 01:45:33.850
SAM: 12.

2897
01:45:33.850 --> 01:45:34.683
MATT: 12?

2898
01:45:34.683 --> 01:45:36.388
SAM: And I will also evade.

2899
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:39.370
MATT: But evade, you fail,
so you take half damage.

2900
01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:40.380
SAM: Sure.

2901
01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:42.730
MATT: So you take seven points of acid damage.

2902
01:45:42.730 --> 01:45:44.360
SAM: Okay.

2903
01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.900
LAURA: I rolled an 18.

2904
01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:48.080
MATT: 18, you take seven points of acid damage.

2905
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.190
TALIESIN: Eight.

2906
01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:51.260
MATT: You take 15 points of acid damage.

2907
01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.093
ASHLEY: 23.

2908
01:45:52.093 --> 01:45:54.170
MATT: 23, you take seven points of acid damage.

2909
01:45:56.572 --> 01:45:57.800
MATT: Let me roll for the horses.

2910
01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.006
LAURA: Oh no!
SAM: Oh no, the horses!

2911
01:46:01.006 --> 01:46:02.315
TALIESIN: Not cool.

2912
01:46:04.255 --> 01:46:05.860
TRAVIS: Like a western,
I lean over the side

2913
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.665
and shield the horse with my body.

2914
01:46:07.665 --> 01:46:11.540
MARISHA: (laughs)
LIAM: (hisses)

2915
01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:14.365
MATT: With the sprays...

2916
01:46:14.365 --> 01:46:15.947
three of the horses fall.

2917
01:46:15.947 --> 01:46:17.200
LAURA: No!

2918
01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:19.580
MATT: Claimed by the horrible liquid

2919
01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.480
that spewed forth from this jet.

2920
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.123
SAM: Oh shit.
LAURA: Poor horses!

2921
01:46:23.123 --> 01:46:24.640
MATT: So you have four horses remaining.

2922
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.450
It is getting denser as you travel forward.

2923
01:46:28.450 --> 01:46:31.430
LAURA: We should probably not
have the horses anymore.

2924
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:32.873
But I don't want to send them back.

2925
01:46:32.873 --> 01:46:34.925
What if there's more harpies?

2926
01:46:34.925 --> 01:46:36.920
Caleb, can you do a spell, and we can just send them

2927
01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.110
to, like, one of the libraries?

2928
01:46:41.110 --> 01:46:43.636
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa, that's a big whoa.

2929
01:46:43.636 --> 01:46:45.413
(laughter)

2930
01:46:45.413 --> 01:46:48.331
SAM: (neighs)

2931
01:46:48.331 --> 01:46:51.250
LIAM: I actually do not have that prepared, no.

2932
01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:52.550
TRAVIS: Jester, if we just leave them here,

2933
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:55.540
by the time we come back, they'll disappear anyway.

2934
01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:56.820
LAURA: That's awful.

2935
01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:58.350
LIAM: Yes, go, look that way.

2936
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:59.740
I will totally

2937
01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.260
magic them away.
TRAVIS: We can send them

2938
01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.380
to the farm, to the horse farm.

2939
01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:05.860
TALIESIN: We can try and leave them somewhere safe and--

2940
01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:08.060
LAURA: No, there's definitely going to be creatures

2941
01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.343
in this forest that will come eat them.

2942
01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:14.018
SAM: Listen, they knew this was a one-way ticket.

2943
01:47:14.018 --> 01:47:18.734
(laughter)

2944
01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.600
TRAVIS: We did notice those long embraces before they left.

2945
01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:26.460
This will be it.

2946
01:47:27.559 --> 01:47:29.740
LAURA: All right, hey, Caleb-- Caduceus,

2947
01:47:31.188 --> 01:47:32.110
can you talk to them--
TALIESIN: We'll have to double up.

2948
01:47:32.110 --> 01:47:36.570
LAURA: And tell them to, like, go back safely?

2949
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:37.403
TALIESIN: I can.

2950
01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:41.450
LAURA: It's getting harder for them to travel, anyway.

2951
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:43.800
TRAVIS: Tell them to get back recklessly.

2952
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.484
TALIESIN: It's going to be rough going from here, kids.

2953
01:47:47.484 --> 01:47:49.150
Why don't we pack it in?

2954
01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:51.780
Do you all remember the way back?

2955
01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.550
MATT: They all loosely look in the direction

2956
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:54.900
of where you traveled from.

2957
01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:58.520
TALIESIN: I think, we'll take what's packed,

2958
01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.550
and we'll let you all head back then,

2959
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:02.383
if that's all right.

2960
01:48:02.383 --> 01:48:05.265
MATT: They look at each other like, "...All right."

2961
01:48:07.204 --> 01:48:08.037
(snorts)
TALIESIN: We could also

2962
01:48:08.037 --> 01:48:09.200
just have them stay here and--

2963
01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.730
ASHLEY: Oh.

2964
01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:13.450
LIAM: Caleb waves his hands in the air for a moment

2965
01:48:13.450 --> 01:48:16.220
and suddenly all the horses look like moorbounders.

2966
01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:19.120
SAM: Ooh!
LAURA: Ooh!

2967
01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:20.580
They <i>look</i> like moorbounders?

2968
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.413
LIAM and SAM: Yeah.

2969
01:48:21.413 --> 01:48:23.010
LAURA: That's cool.
TALIESIN: Oh.

2970
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:24.640
TRAVIS: Less likely to be attacked.

2971
01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.570
SAM: Just go, all right!

2972
01:48:25.570 --> 01:48:27.850
LIAM: But they walk really funny.
SAM: We didn't like you anyway!

2973
01:48:27.850 --> 01:48:29.414
Just go!

2974
01:48:29.414 --> 01:48:33.980
LAURA: (laughs) Moorbounders, walking all prancy.

2975
01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:36.220
TALIESIN: Please, please, I know what you're rolling.

2976
01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:38.120
MATT: One of the horses looks extremely spooked

2977
01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.705
by suddenly being surrounded by other moorbounders.

2978
01:48:40.705 --> 01:48:42.990
But the other ones acknowledge

2979
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:45.410
that this was an illusory shift,

2980
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:46.640
but that one is still (gasps).

2981
01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.750
TALIESIN: No, this is, it's not real, it's not real.

2982
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:49.750
It's just a thing.
LAURA: You have to look

2983
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:50.710
at yourself, look at yourself!
TALIESIN: You're fine.

2984
01:48:50.710 --> 01:48:52.802
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

2985
01:48:52.802 --> 01:48:54.083
LIAM: Falls into a pool of acid.

2986
01:48:54.083 --> 01:48:55.190
MARISHA: And he's dead.

2987
01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:57.194
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god, 10.
MATT: 10?

2988
01:48:57.194 --> 01:48:58.490
TALIESIN: 10.
MATT: You just manage

2989
01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:00.820
to slowly calm it down.

2990
01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.460
TALIESIN: This is just to keep other things away.

2991
01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.710
It's all just to keep you safe.

2992
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:07.930
MATT: You manage to calm it, and the four of them,

2993
01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:10.400
with their new illusory presence, begin

2994
01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.090
to make their way back in the direction

2995
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:14.180
from where you guys came.
LIAM: Eight hours.

2996
01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.030
TRAVIS: Nice job, you guys.

2997
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:18.780
SAM: Critical Role does not have the ASPCA logo.

2998
01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.580
MATT: No, no.

2999
01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.820
You guys have been responsible, over the years,

3000
01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:24.420
for many a mount death.

3001
01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.850
TALIESIN: That will be the final boss,

3002
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:29.670
will just be the reanimated corpse of every pet

3003
01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:31.586
and workhorse.
ASHLEY: Sprinkle.

3004
01:49:31.586 --> 01:49:33.758
LAURA: Oh, Sprinkle's the leader.

3005
01:49:33.758 --> 01:49:34.900
TALIESIN: (grunts)

3006
01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:36.322
TRAVIS: So much acid.

3007
01:49:36.322 --> 01:49:38.284
(laughter)

3008
01:49:38.284 --> 01:49:39.352
LAURA: The Whispered Weasel.

3009
01:49:39.352 --> 01:49:42.090
(laughter)

3010
01:49:42.090 --> 01:49:42.923
TALIESIN: (hisses)

3011
01:49:42.923 --> 01:49:44.319
MARISHA: He's a constellation now, yeah.

3012
01:49:44.319 --> 01:49:46.640
LAURA: (laughs)

3013
01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:49.620
MATT: All righty, so horseless, you guys begin

3014
01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.920
to press on further into the next leg of your journey.

3015
01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.390
As the hard ground of this element at the swamp begins

3016
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:59.330
to slowly soften, and with footfalls around you,

3017
01:49:59.330 --> 01:50:01.520
you begin to hear this familiar slush

3018
01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.837
of wet mud beneath your feet.

3019
01:50:03.837 --> 01:50:06.050
(slurping)

3020
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:08.750
This slight sucking sensation of having to pull your boots

3021
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:10.810
from the muck, you're beginning to helm

3022
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:14.010
into mild marshland.

3023
01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:16.710
Who's helming this next leg of the journey?

3024
01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:17.543
LAURA: Oh god.

3025
01:50:17.543 --> 01:50:18.740
MARISHA: Yasha.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3026
01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:20.530
MARISHA: You're use to marsh.

3027
01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:21.380
ASHLEY: I'm used to it.

3028
01:50:22.434 --> 01:50:24.010
I'm used to this terrain.

3029
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:25.680
I'll take the lead.

3030
01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.220
MATT: Okay.

3031
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:30.080
What skill would you like to present for this one?

3032
01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.754
ASHLEY: Performance!

3033
01:50:31.754 --> 01:50:35.167
(laughter)

3034
01:50:35.167 --> 01:50:36.693
SAM: A little soft-shoe.

3035
01:50:36.693 --> 01:50:38.431
ASHLEY: ♪ Dah, dah, dah, dah-dah, rah, dah, dah-dah ♪

3036
01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:41.295
MATT: Real soft-shoe the swamp (slurps).

3037
01:50:41.295 --> 01:50:44.080
MARISHA: ♪ I'm singing in the swamp ♪

3038
01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.600
ASHLEY: Let's do,

3039
01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.240
can I do athletics,

3040
01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.210
because I'm moving through it, just so smoothly?

3041
01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:56.870
MATT: Because you guys are on foot, you can attempt

3042
01:50:56.870 --> 01:51:00.430
to use your athletics to help find routes

3043
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:02.550
outside of the swamp and through boughs and trees,

3044
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:04.700
leaping from branch and finding this out.

3045
01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:08.510
It's going to be a high DC, but it's possible.

3046
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:09.343
ASHLEY: Okay.

3047
01:51:09.343 --> 01:51:10.520
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to give you Guidance.

3048
01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.080
ASHLEY: Okay.

3049
01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:12.980
Oh, that's cocked.

3050
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:15.283
Oh boy.

3051
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:18.780
Oh, okay, good, a natural 20.

3052
01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:19.613
TRAVIS: Oh!

3053
01:51:19.613 --> 01:51:21.160
ASHLEY: I rolled a one and a natural 20.

3054
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.520
So that would be 28.

3055
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.320
MATT: Well, Guidance is not advantage.

3056
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.700
ASHLEY: Ah, never mind.

3057
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:28.949
MATT: So you rolled a natural one.
ASHLEY: So I rolled a one.

3058
01:51:28.949 --> 01:51:30.960
(laughter)

3059
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.440
MATT: Guidance adds a d4.

3060
01:51:33.490 --> 01:51:34.339
ASHLEY: Okay.

3061
01:51:34.339 --> 01:51:35.260
(laughter)

3062
01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:37.482
MATT: Then add your athletic skill.

3063
01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:40.510
SAM: And that's 26.

3064
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:41.600
LAURA: And we go.

3065
01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.250
TRAVIS: Mercer giveth and Mercer taketh away.

3066
01:51:44.250 --> 01:51:46.743
ASHLEY: Can I borrow a d4? I'm sorry.

3067
01:51:46.743 --> 01:51:48.181
LAURA: Yasha doesn't use--
ASHLEY: Cool.

3068
01:51:48.181 --> 01:51:50.690
Okay, that's a one.

3069
01:51:50.690 --> 01:51:53.070
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

3070
01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:54.130
ASHLEY: Okay, 10.

3071
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:54.963
MATT: 10, okay.

3072
01:51:56.407 --> 01:51:57.610
LIAM: (splats)

3073
01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:58.990
MATT: Yasha, you're used to--

3074
01:51:58.990 --> 01:52:01.920
ASHLEY: Sorry, I thought you said, sorry, my bad, sorry.

3075
01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:02.753
MATT: It's all good.

3076
01:52:02.753 --> 01:52:04.690
You're used to the swamplands of Xhorhas,

3077
01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:08.900
where you've traveled through and grew near the Sorrowseep

3078
01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:12.320
and the Moorlands, where you spent a lot of your life.

3079
01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.770
These are different kind of swamp,

3080
01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:17.290
and the trees are not as strong

3081
01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:18.123
as you would have thought.

3082
01:52:18.123 --> 01:52:19.180
Some of them appear to be petrified,

3083
01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.440
and some have died a long time ago.

3084
01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.740
As you begin to leap from branch

3085
01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:24.820
to finding the right trees in the various places

3086
01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:28.200
where the ground is higher than the heavy water

3087
01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.950
that tends to sit in a lot of the spaces,

3088
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:33.260
a lot of them are soft and bend or break,

3089
01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:36.347
and that's a fail.

3090
01:52:38.057 --> 01:52:38.890
LAURA: God.

3091
01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:43.000
MATT: Nothing terrible happens, but the physical action

3092
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.390
of you guys following this path, the heavy mist

3093
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:49.940
that's around you and the just physical exertion

3094
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:52.520
that has come to all of you, I need you all

3095
01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:55.072
to make constitution-saving throws for me, please.

3096
01:52:55.072 --> 01:52:58.210
ASHLEY: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: (humming)

3097
01:53:00.496 --> 01:53:01.329
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

3098
01:53:01.329 --> 01:53:02.414
Natural one.
TALIESIN: Ah!

3099
01:53:02.414 --> 01:53:04.200
LAURA: Oh my god.
MATT: Natural one.

3100
01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.260
You take a point of exhaustion.

3101
01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.390
MARISHA: 11.
MATT: Point of exhaustion.

3102
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:09.774
Caleb?

3103
01:53:09.774 --> 01:53:10.607
LIAM: <i>Un momento</i>.

3104
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:14.820
15.

3105
01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:17.110
MATT: 15, you manage to pull through.

3106
01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.290
SAM: 13.

3107
01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:20.950
MATT: 13, you have a point of exhaustion.

3108
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:25.950
SAM: So is that two points of exhaustion?

3109
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:29.050
I'm drunk as well, which you sort

3110
01:53:29.050 --> 01:53:32.710
of said is like disadvantage on ability checks.

3111
01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:34.670
MATT: Correct, it's not two points of exhaustion.

3112
01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:36.010
It's just double--

3113
01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:37.600
SAM: Double disadvantage?

3114
01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.490
MATT: You just have disadvantage.

3115
01:53:38.490 --> 01:53:41.030
It's just your disadvantage with that, but as opposed

3116
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:43.730
to where that was just dexterity ability checks--

3117
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:46.239
SAM: No, that's everything.

3118
01:53:46.239 --> 01:53:48.440
MATT: Then the exhaustion is everything, yeah.

3119
01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:52.030
SAM: No, I mean, I was already disadvantaged

3120
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:53.990
on every ability check.

3121
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:56.700
So now do I have more disadvantage?

3122
01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:57.533
MATT: No, it's just--

3123
01:53:57.533 --> 01:53:58.366
SAM: Okay, cool.
LAURA: You're still okay.

3124
01:53:58.366 --> 01:54:00.370
SAM: I'll take it.
MARISHA: Does that stay?

3125
01:54:00.370 --> 01:54:01.770
MATT: Jester.
LAURA: 19.

3126
01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:03.110
MATT: 19, you're fine.

3127
01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:03.943
Caduceus?

3128
01:54:03.943 --> 01:54:05.650
TALIESIN: Nine.
MATT: Nine, point of exhaustion.

3129
01:54:05.650 --> 01:54:06.880
LAURA: Wow!

3130
01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:07.960
MATT: Yasha?
ASHLEY: 17.

3131
01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:08.890
MATT: 17, you're fine.

3132
01:54:08.890 --> 01:54:10.340
TRAVIS: What is it disadvantage on that?

3133
01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:13.870
MATT: Disadvantage on ability checks, just in general.

3134
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:15.635
LAURA: Just a disadvantage in life.

3135
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:19.210
MATT: But you've made yourself part way

3136
01:54:19.210 --> 01:54:21.060
into the swamp, and you're getting close

3137
01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:25.200
to the very base center of this valley.

3138
01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:28.980
The water, in places, is creeping up the knee to the thigh,

3139
01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:30.870
and some of them, you have to push through waist-high,

3140
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:33.490
keeping your equipment in bags above you,

3141
01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:35.248
as you slowly (slurps)--

3142
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:37.143
LAURA: We still have

3143
01:54:37.143 --> 01:54:38.580
to get two successes?
MATT: Push through the swamp.

3144
01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:39.413
Yeah.
SAM: We got this.

3145
01:54:39.413 --> 01:54:40.246
We got this.

3146
01:54:40.246 --> 01:54:41.240
We're all at disadvantage now.

3147
01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:42.120
MARISHA: Two and two, right?

3148
01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.400
We're two for two.

3149
01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:44.910
MATT: You have two victories.

3150
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:48.200
You need two more successes.
LAURA: Two more victories.

3151
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.580
We got a lot more failures than victories.

3152
01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:51.920
LIAM: Caleb is going to pause for a moment

3153
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.320
and pull out a piece of obsidian and hold it to his chest

3154
01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.110
and start casting in front of him,

3155
01:54:57.110 --> 01:55:02.110
and a dark mirror image of Caleb (whooshes)

3156
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.530
comes into existence, casting Resonant Echo.

3157
01:55:05.530 --> 01:55:06.450
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3158
01:55:06.450 --> 01:55:07.860
LIAM: So there is now a darker,

3159
01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:10.550
shadier Caleb walking with Caleb.

3160
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:12.330
MATT: Okay, it's made mostly of, like,

3161
01:55:12.330 --> 01:55:16.460
it looks immaterial shadow or black smoke

3162
01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:19.700
in a form that is very reminiscent of Caleb

3163
01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:22.370
in almost every way, other than the fact

3164
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:24.640
that you can kind of see through it.

3165
01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.180
LIAM: He looks at one and goes,

3166
01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.500
and the other one goes,

3167
01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:28.500
and they start walking.

3168
01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:31.160
SAM: Fjord, take note.

3169
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.750
Super mysterious.

3170
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:34.250
No idea what he's doing.

3171
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:36.420
He looks a little gothic and cool.

3172
01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:37.350
Just a note.

3173
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:39.830
LAURA: Is that how cool I look when I Invoke Duplicity.

3174
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:42.090
SAM: Well, I mean, that thing is dark and brooding.

3175
01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:45.260
The thing that you make is just so sweet.

3176
01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:46.320
I mean, it looks cool.
LAURA: Okay.

3177
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:48.000
SAM: It just doesn't look, like, dark.

3178
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.010
LAURA: All right.

3179
01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:50.800
MARISHA: I think Jester's very mysterious.

3180
01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:51.770
SAM: Jester's the best.

3181
01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:53.360
LAURA: Thank you.

3182
01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.370
SAM: Just not very dark.

3183
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:59.060
I will helm this next leg of the journey!

3184
01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.160
MATT: All righty.

3185
01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:02.420
How would you like to aid your party

3186
01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:05.120
in traveling through the swamp?
SAM: I will investigate--

3187
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:07.123
MATT: Okay.

3188
01:56:07.123 --> 01:56:08.860
SAM: (laughs) The areas of the swamp,

3189
01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:12.360
trying to glean from markings and things

3190
01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.080
which direction animals have gone to circumvent dangers.

3191
01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.280
Hmm?
MATT: Okay.

3192
01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:19.470
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

3193
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:20.960
MATT: Go ahead and make a check.

3194
01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:22.000
LAURA: Hey!
SAM: Ah!

3195
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.583
LAURA: The Traveler believes in you.

3196
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:29.870
SAM: Oh wait, disadvantage.

3197
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:30.718
Hmm.

3198
01:56:30.718 --> 01:56:32.636
TALIESIN: Plus a d4.
LAURA: Plus four.

3199
01:56:32.636 --> 01:56:33.469
SAM: Ah, okay.

3200
01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:35.625
Oh!

3201
01:56:35.625 --> 01:56:37.350
LAURA: (giggles)

3202
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:38.610
SAM: This is investigation?

3203
01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:39.443
MATT: Yes.

3204
01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:42.340
SAM: 29!

3205
01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:44.640
MARISHA: Whoa!
ASHLEY: Wow, jeez.

3206
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.690
MATT: That'll be your third success (laughs).

3207
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:50.630
You do, actually, keeping track of
watching the various birds

3208
01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:53.170
that travel through, markings for woodland creatures

3209
01:56:53.170 --> 01:56:55.300
and sometimes larger than woodland creatures,

3210
01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:58.890
you can see different patterns across the bark of the trees

3211
01:56:58.890 --> 01:57:02.130
and elements of the stone and exposed earth outside

3212
01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:04.850
of the water that show you the often-traveled paths

3213
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:06.860
of the denizens of this swamp,

3214
01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:10.140
which, one, helps you stay in the safer route

3215
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.960
from any sort of natural hazards around you,

3216
01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:14.750
two, helps you avoid crossing paths

3217
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:18.475
with where some of the more predatory

3218
01:57:18.475 --> 01:57:20.366
denizens might be.

3219
01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:24.890
So with that, you push through a majority of the swamp,

3220
01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:27.520
exiting where the deepest parts of the waters are

3221
01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.610
and begin to make your way up the incline

3222
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:32.370
towards the base of Mount Mentiri.

3223
01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:34.170
You grow close to the end of this journey,

3224
01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:37.940
towards where, at least you assume, the home

3225
01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:40.650
of this sage might be.

3226
01:57:40.650 --> 01:57:41.930
Who wants to handle this next leg of the journey?

3227
01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:43.620
LAURA: Should we sleep?

3228
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.210
SAM: What time is it?
TRAVIS: Should we take a short rest?

3229
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:46.770
SAM: It's been a half hour.

3230
01:57:46.770 --> 01:57:48.590
MATT: At this point, you've been traveling

3231
01:57:48.590 --> 01:57:51.770
since very early in the day, when you guys left.

3232
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:55.595
You gather you're probably about two hours out from dusk.

3233
01:57:57.090 --> 01:57:59.810
MARISHA: I feel like if we can
just get a little bit further,

3234
01:57:59.810 --> 01:58:00.980
we'll be better off.

3235
01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:02.200
LAURA: What if we get a little bit further,

3236
01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:03.780
and the hut's, like, right there.

3237
01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.790
Then the witch, like, knows of everything

3238
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:07.410
that's within, like, range of her,

3239
01:58:07.410 --> 01:58:09.320
and then she comes and she attacks us in the night,

3240
01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.100
and then we all die, because we're exhausted?

3241
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.690
TRAVIS: I could use a short rest.

3242
01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:13.523
SAM: A short rest?

3243
01:58:13.523 --> 01:58:15.020
But I mean, if you short rest,

3244
01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.150
then it's going to be nighttime.

3245
01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:18.220
I say we press on until we get closer.

3246
01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:19.080
LAURA: Okay.

3247
01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.508
TRAVIS: I could helm this last bit.

3248
01:58:20.508 --> 01:58:23.050
TALIESIN: There's nowhere to--
LAURA: Do it, Fjord!

3249
01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:25.740
TALIESIN: This is not a good stopping point, I assume.

3250
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:26.970
It doesn't seem to be a--

3251
01:58:26.970 --> 01:58:28.670
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's not a happy, fun place.

3252
01:58:28.670 --> 01:58:31.379
MATT: Ah, you can camp in the middle of a swamp, sure.

3253
01:58:31.379 --> 01:58:33.240
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3254
01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.550
MARISHA: Yeah, let's just get to high ground.

3255
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:39.850
TRAVIS: I will use Mask of Many Faces

3256
01:58:39.850 --> 01:58:43.710
to make myself look like an undead harpy,

3257
01:58:43.710 --> 01:58:47.180
that we just killed, and I will try

3258
01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:52.180
and deceive my way through the swamp,

3259
01:58:52.442 --> 01:58:55.810
acting like I know where I'm going,

3260
01:58:55.810 --> 01:58:57.730
on my way.

3261
01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.850
SAM: You're going to bullshit

3262
01:58:59.850 --> 01:59:01.217
your way there there?
TRAVIS: (squawking)

3263
01:59:01.217 --> 01:59:03.467
LIAM: So you're just going to make squawking sounds?

3264
01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:07.929
TALIESIN: We're going to let Fjord
go about 20 feet in front of us.

3265
01:59:07.929 --> 01:59:08.976
TRAVIS: Sure, sure.

3266
01:59:08.976 --> 01:59:10.130
MATT: That's a good call.

3267
01:59:10.130 --> 01:59:11.900
SAM: He's method acting his way there.

3268
01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:17.390
LAURA: I'm going to Guidance him in some way.

3269
01:59:18.617 --> 01:59:20.680
Fjord, I believe in you.

3270
01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.758
LIAM: What inspires harpies?

3271
01:59:22.758 --> 01:59:25.687
(laughter)

3272
01:59:25.687 --> 01:59:26.520
SAM: How do they move?

3273
01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.980
MATT: All right, if you're going to inspire on this,

3274
01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:31.590
I will say that will put you adjacent to the undead harpy,

3275
01:59:31.590 --> 01:59:33.990
because you only have six seconds for Guidance to last.

3276
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:36.470
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3277
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:37.560
LAURA: Okay.

3278
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:38.760
TRAVIS: You don't have to.
ASHLEY: Can I assist?

3279
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:40.790
TRAVIS: Guidance is fun.

3280
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:42.880
MATT: If you want to walk ahead with him?

3281
01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:44.130
ASHLEY: I'll walk ahead with him.

3282
01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:48.060
MATT: Okay, so you have one undead harpy and a Yasha,

3283
01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:52.276
both hobbling through the

3284
01:59:52.276 --> 01:59:56.470
last elements of the swamp.

3285
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:57.347
Roll.

3286
01:59:57.347 --> 01:59:59.304
(laughter)

3287
01:59:59.304 --> 02:00:01.400
TRAVIS: At disadvantage, right, or is it a straight roll?

3288
02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.300
MATT: Well, it's disadvantage
if you have a point of exhaustion.

3289
02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:04.133
TRAVIS: I do.

3290
02:00:04.133 --> 02:00:06.050
MATT: So it's just a single roll.
ASHLEY: Disappear.

3291
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:09.030
MATT: And it's a real high DC.
MARISHA: It's the last anyone'll ever see.

3292
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:11.700
LIAM: A roc scoops him up in one bite.

3293
02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:12.760
LAURA: Natural 20.

3294
02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.310
TRAVIS: Did you give me Guidance?

3295
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:15.210
LAURA: No, I didn't.

3296
02:00:15.210 --> 02:00:17.960
TRAVIS: Oh, well, that would've helped, 16.

3297
02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:18.890
MATT: 16.

3298
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.100
The mists around you don't seem

3299
02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:33.708
to bear any sort of

3300
02:00:36.966 --> 02:00:38.560
emotional connection

3301
02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.220
to an undead harpy or a wandering aasimar barbarian.

3302
02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:48.290
The shadows in these mists are different

3303
02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:50.780
from the ones you pass through naturally.

3304
02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:53.690
As your proximity grows closer to Mount Mentiri

3305
02:00:53.690 --> 02:00:56.200
and perhaps some of the things that call its base

3306
02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:00.450
and mountainsides home, something sinister curls

3307
02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:03.280
from the surrounding fog.

3308
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:06.410
It enwraps you to the point where you find yourself

3309
02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:09.710
coughing and out of breath for a moment,

3310
02:01:09.710 --> 02:01:11.900
as do you, as do all of you.

3311
02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:16.900
I need everyone to make a constitution saving throw, please.

3312
02:01:18.074 --> 02:01:18.907
SAM: Everyone?

3313
02:01:18.907 --> 02:01:20.350
TALIESIN: Constitution-saving throw, add a--

3314
02:01:22.772 --> 02:01:24.527
ASHLEY: This thing is cocked, all the time.

3315
02:01:24.527 --> 02:01:25.360
SAM: Terrible.
TRAVIS: 13.

3316
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.280
LAURA: Yeah, it's that dice.

3317
02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.560
TALIESIN: Disadvantage?

3318
02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.860
MATT: You manage to resist it.
SAM: No, it's a save.

3319
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:32.223
MARISHA: Nine.

3320
02:01:32.223 --> 02:01:35.020
MATT: Nine, I rolled shitty, so you take three points

3321
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:39.400
of necrotic damage, and your max HP is reduced by three.

3322
02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.030
SAM: Ooh.

3323
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:42.320
LIAM: 24.

3324
02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.280
MATT: 24, you're fine.

3325
02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:45.360
SAM: 11.

3326
02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:47.580
MATT: 11, you take three points of necrotic damage,

3327
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:49.380
and your max HP is reduced by three.

3328
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:51.263
LAURA: 20.

3329
02:01:51.263 --> 02:01:52.096
MATT: 20, you are fine.

3330
02:01:52.096 --> 02:01:53.390
Caduceus?
TALIESIN: 10.

3331
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.350
MATT: 10, take three points of necrotic damage,

3332
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:57.010
and your max HP is reduced by three.

3333
02:01:57.010 --> 02:01:57.843
ASHLEY: 11.

3334
02:01:57.843 --> 02:01:59.280
MATT: 11, you as well.

3335
02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:02.310
TRAVIS: Is that a poison that we're inhaling?

3336
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:04.140
MATT: There is something within the mist

3337
02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:08.420
that has a dark, ghostly energy.

3338
02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.520
Then once it seems to have feasted on your life essence,

3339
02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:16.310
it vanishes off into the fog, satiated and hard to trace.

3340
02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:18.850
TRAVIS: I'll drop the undead harpy.

3341
02:02:18.850 --> 02:02:19.683
MATT: Okay.

3342
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:22.370
You're growing close still,

3343
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:24.620
and you can see heavy brambles ahead.

3344
02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:29.620
In fact, there is a series of tangled, heavy bramble vines

3345
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:34.240
that will very soon, probably, begin to prevent you

3346
02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:37.575
from traversing, unless anyone's particularly clever.

3347
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:42.540
You can see these heavy, root-like twists

3348
02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:45.890
and knots that are covered in these varying sized,

3349
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:48.750
natural points and pikes that emerge

3350
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:52.730
from the wood, like rose thorns the size

3351
02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:55.770
of short swords and daggers.

3352
02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:58.020
SAM: Yasha, cut through them with your strength!

3353
02:03:01.702 --> 02:03:03.027
ASHLEY: I can try.

3354
02:03:05.358 --> 02:03:06.560
What are you going to do?

3355
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.710
TALIESIN: I'll wait till we have 10 minutes to stop,

3356
02:03:08.710 --> 02:03:10.520
and then, because it takes 10 minutes of--

3357
02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.110
TRAVIS: What does?
LAURA: We could take 10 minutes.

3358
02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:14.010
TRAVIS: Just to give everybody a little--

3359
02:03:14.010 --> 02:03:17.270
LAURA: Prayer of Healing.
TALIESIN: Prayer of Healing.

3360
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:18.650
LAURA: I think we should take 10 minutes.

3361
02:03:18.650 --> 02:03:20.140
TRAVIS: Yeah, take 10 minutes.

3362
02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:21.596
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Take 10 minutes.

3363
02:03:21.596 --> 02:03:25.040
MATT: Okay. You've emerged from the swamp waters

3364
02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:29.280
and make your way towards the cusp of this bramble wall

3365
02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:32.230
around the forest, you stop for 10 minutes

3366
02:03:32.230 --> 02:03:33.570
and go ahead and cast Prayer of Healing,

3367
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:35.180
and that heals everyone for?

3368
02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.260
TALIESIN: That heals, actually, not quite everybody.

3369
02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:39.926
MATT: Six targets?
TALIESIN: Six targets, so--

3370
02:03:39.926 --> 02:03:41.910
MARISHA: I'm good.
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four,

3371
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:43.940
five, everyone but Beau, so four.

3372
02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:45.640
LAURA: Does Beau not need it at all?

3373
02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:47.810
MARISHA: I'm down by my max healing, so I'm good.

3374
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:49.120
I can't heal past that anyway.

3375
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.620
I'm good.
TALIESIN: So everyone gets...

3376
02:03:58.165 --> 02:04:01.080
I did it at 2nd-level, so yeah,

3377
02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:04.040
oh, I did it 3rd-level, so it's 3d8.

3378
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:04.910
SAM: That's a lot.

3379
02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:08.910
TALIESIN: 17 points.

3380
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:09.960
LAURA: Wow.

3381
02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:10.793
MATT: All righty.

3382
02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:13.922
So everyone else heals 17 hit points,

3383
02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:18.610
and you finish the rest of your walk up towards the edge

3384
02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:20.337
of this heavy bramble wall.

3385
02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:26.210
SAM: Well, I could sort of--

3386
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:28.910
LAURA: Use, like, Sleight of Hand?

3387
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:33.410
SAM: I could get through it with my sort of stealthy skills,

3388
02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:35.410
or you could flip your way through the briar patch.

3389
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:36.900
TRAVIS: You could just fireball that wall.

3390
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:39.042
SAM: Or Yasha could cut her way through.
LIAM: Is there a canopy

3391
02:04:39.042 --> 02:04:41.220
of trees still here, or are we more in--

3392
02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:42.053
MATT: There is.

3393
02:04:42.053 --> 02:04:43.780
SAM: Rage through it.
LAURA: We can try Sacred Flame

3394
02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:45.630
on the brambles and see.

3395
02:04:45.630 --> 02:04:46.640
SAM: Sure.

3396
02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.760
LAURA: I'm going to try Sacred Flame on the brambles

3397
02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.490
and see if I can set some of it on fire,

3398
02:04:51.490 --> 02:04:53.200
to try to clear it out.

3399
02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.033
MATT: Okay.

3400
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:58.140
You cast Sacred Flame and the radiant energy

3401
02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.690
surrounds and focuses one area.

3402
02:04:59.690 --> 02:05:02.580
You can see elements of the bramble blacken.

3403
02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:06.730
They are very moist, and the fire doesn't catch.

3404
02:05:06.730 --> 02:05:09.790
The Sacred Flame is not a super-heated flame

3405
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:11.730
as much as it is a radiant blast,

3406
02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:14.300
so it doesn't seem to have a strong effect on the brambles.

3407
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.820
LIAM: As long as we've gone that far, Caleb will follow up

3408
02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:19.670
and hit the same spot with literal fire,

3409
02:05:19.670 --> 02:05:20.503
just a Fire Bolt.

3410
02:05:20.503 --> 02:05:21.350
MATT: Just a Fire Bolt?
LIAM: Yeah.

3411
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:22.940
MATT: It hits, and you see the brambles darken.

3412
02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:25.140
There's a little bit of a glow.

3413
02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:27.250
It's burnable, but it would take

3414
02:05:27.250 --> 02:05:28.934
a vast amount of fire.
LAURA: I wonder they make it

3415
02:05:28.934 --> 02:05:30.440
more brittle, though.

3416
02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.800
ASHLEY: I'll try to cut through it.

3417
02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:33.260
LAURA: In that same spot?

3418
02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:34.140
SAM: You're going to rage through it?

3419
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:34.973
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3420
02:05:34.973 --> 02:05:36.390
MATT: You're going to attempt to carve through the brambles?

3421
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:39.020
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: As the check here?

3422
02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:40.020
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

3423
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.442
So go ahead and make a strength ability check,

3424
02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.180
TALIESIN: Let me give you a d4,

3425
02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:46.780
going into that.
ASHLEY: Goddamn it.

3426
02:05:48.370 --> 02:05:50.655
Natural 20.
TALIESIN: Never mind, yeah.

3427
02:05:50.655 --> 02:05:52.020
MATT: Do you have a point of exhaustion,

3428
02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:53.970
or did you resist that?

3429
02:05:53.970 --> 02:05:55.560
ASHLEY: I resisted it.

3430
02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:57.190
MATT: Correct.

3431
02:05:57.190 --> 02:05:58.740
And you have an advantage on your strength check?

3432
02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:00.230
Are you raging in advance of it?

3433
02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:01.657
LAURA: Oh, no. It was just cocked
when she rolled the first time.

3434
02:06:01.657 --> 02:06:03.730
MATT: Oh, got you, okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

3435
02:06:03.730 --> 02:06:05.110
MATT: So natural 20.
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

3436
02:06:05.110 --> 02:06:06.890
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Whew!

3437
02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:09.790
MATT: So that little part of the bramble twists there,

3438
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:12.580
that you guys have slightly damaged a bit,

3439
02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:15.320
Yasha wielding-- which blade of your choice?

3440
02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.180
ASHLEY: Skingorger.
MATT: Skingorger,

3441
02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:21.805
this really terrifying-looking,

3442
02:06:21.805 --> 02:06:26.580
dual-handed, front-edged blade of rust and jagged edge,

3443
02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:28.130
just carves through,

3444
02:06:28.130 --> 02:06:30.750
and the bramble collapses inward,

3445
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:33.390
and a second strike and a third strike,

3446
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:35.290
and one after another, you begin to carve your way

3447
02:06:35.290 --> 02:06:36.600
through this bramble forest.

3448
02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.990
It's slow-going, and it continues on

3449
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:42.780
for another 60 or so feet.

3450
02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.000
LAURA: Whoa.

3451
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.750
MATT: But with the size of the blade and the sheer immensity

3452
02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:49.180
of your strength, with a natural 20,

3453
02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.350
you begin to carve a path through that is safe enough

3454
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:55.029
for you to travel single-file, without taking any damage.

3455
02:06:55.029 --> 02:06:56.750
SAM: Nice!

3456
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:59.480
LIAM: Caleb turns to his double and goes: After you.

3457
02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.650
And the shadow walks in,

3458
02:07:00.650 --> 02:07:02.600
and he follows.
MATT: All right.

3459
02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.350
You guys follow Yasha's lead until eventually,

3460
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:05.960
you get to that final element of the bramble,

3461
02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.660
and you cut through, and as you slice that last bit,

3462
02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.520
and it falls away, you can see now

3463
02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:14.160
that large bramble wall begins to fall away,

3464
02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:18.270
and you can see the brush and the hill rise up,

3465
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:19.690
and you can see more of the trees ahead,

3466
02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:21.500
some of them still petrified,

3467
02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:24.040
though the gray coloration

3468
02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:27.730
of their branches growing more and more present,

3469
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:29.700
as you get closer to Mount Mentiri.

3470
02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:30.950
You can smell that sulfurous scent,

3471
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:33.430
but something else hits your nose as well,

3472
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:37.200
a heavy, asphalt smell.

3473
02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:38.070
As you begin to look ahead,

3474
02:07:38.070 --> 02:07:39.940
you can see small patches in the ground,

3475
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:42.180
where a black tar-like substance seems

3476
02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:44.725
to be pushing through the floor,

3477
02:07:45.650 --> 02:07:48.920
little black puddles, thick, and reaches.

3478
02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:55.100
Continuing forward, you can see the stone

3479
02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:58.500
and the earth of the area beginning

3480
02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:02.050
to turn more deep red, at the mountain.

3481
02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:03.400
Some areas are almost yellow,

3482
02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:06.270
like a dust has gathered on them.

3483
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:08.760
There are a couple of small, little steam vents

3484
02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:13.760
that are releasing this lazy trail of heated moisture

3485
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:17.660
that dissipates and joins the rest of the mist around you.

3486
02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:19.660
The fog is not as strong and as intense

3487
02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:22.470
as it was deep in the swamp, but there is a low-lying fog

3488
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:24.600
that coasts about a foot and half off the ground,

3489
02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:26.050
universally, over this space.

3490
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:31.220
As you push forward, the trees thin a bit,

3491
02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:34.960
and you can see there are a few little elements

3492
02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:38.080
on the ground where the elevation shifts a bit,

3493
02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.000
and ahead, there is one mild hill, where,

3494
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.922
through the fog and mist, you can see a frame.

3495
02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.176
You can see almost a porch

3496
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:55.900
of a home, no more than maybe 15, 20 foot, end to end,

3497
02:08:56.970 --> 02:09:01.886
a heavy-thatched top to it

3498
02:09:01.886 --> 02:09:04.210
that is green,

3499
02:09:04.210 --> 02:09:07.260
brightly green with moss and mold and other sorts

3500
02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:10.210
of natural growth that has taken root.

3501
02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:12.170
It's like a cabin put together

3502
02:09:12.170 --> 02:09:15.350
from numerous thin, tall trees.

3503
02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:18.590
You see hanging from the outside of it,

3504
02:09:18.590 --> 02:09:23.507
from elements of chain and rope, look to be hooks,

3505
02:09:23.507 --> 02:09:24.480
what would be for lanterns

3506
02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:27.102
or tools or implements, who knows?

3507
02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.610
There is a wooden rack, off to the side of the porch,

3508
02:09:32.610 --> 02:09:37.015
that contains handful of leathers that are stretched out.

3509
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:39.390
MARISHA: What kind of leathers?

3510
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:40.806
MATT: Can't really tell from this distance.

3511
02:09:40.806 --> 02:09:41.639
MARISHA: Oh shit.

3512
02:09:41.639 --> 02:09:43.660
MATT: There is a door that is partially ajar,

3513
02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:47.368
and there is a warm light from the inside.

3514
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:50.383
And that's where we're going to take a break.

3515
02:09:50.383 --> 02:09:51.850
(groaning)

3516
02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:52.895
SAM: You bastard.

3517
02:09:52.895 --> 02:09:54.081
MATT: Mm.

3518
02:09:54.081 --> 02:09:55.100
We'll return here in a few minutes

3519
02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:57.218
to see what this house is.

3520
02:09:57.218 --> 02:09:58.610
MARISHA: What is this house?

3521
02:09:58.610 --> 02:09:59.780
SAM: It could just be somebody's house.

3522
02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:00.750
MATT: Probably.

3523
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:02.900
In the interim, we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway,

3524
02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:03.733
at the break.

3525
02:10:03.733 --> 02:10:07.070
We have the black poisonwood dice vault here.

3526
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:08.960
Boop, it opens up.

3527
02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:09.793
It's nice.

3528
02:10:09.793 --> 02:10:10.626
It smells nice.

3529
02:10:10.626 --> 02:10:12.894
What we do is we smell Wyrmwood.

3530
02:10:12.894 --> 02:10:14.120
It has mild hallucinogenic properties.

3531
02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.530
That's not true, do not quote me on that.

3532
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:18.570
But one lucky winner will have this,

3533
02:10:18.570 --> 02:10:19.720
when we come back from the break.

3534
02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:24.720
Tonight's chat keyword is superstition.

3535
02:10:25.087 --> 02:10:26.526
ALL: Superstition.

3536
02:10:26.526 --> 02:10:28.910

Any more than once, you'll be disqualified,

3540
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:35.120
and once again, people in the US and Canada,

3541
02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.990
only excluded in Quebec, because of stupid laws.

3542
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:38.000
We'll be back here in a few minutes,

3543
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.530
with the winner and the next leg of our journey.

3544
02:10:40.530 --> 02:10:42.642

02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.360
VO: Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II,

3567
02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.970
the game where you simulate a game master,

3568
02:11:41.970 --> 02:11:44.280
the game players in a rousing world

3569
02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:48.957
of bizarre pop culture adventuring, for free!

3570
02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:54.770
Amass a hideously unreasonable horde of ill-gotten loot,

3571
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:57.630
without sacrificing any of your own.

3572
02:11:57.630 --> 02:12:01.020
Enjoy all of the randomly generated dungeons,

3573
02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:04.750
customizable monster battles and dicey dilemmas of Paperos

3574
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:07.910
with your own party of simulated friends.

3575
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:09.900
Never argue with anyone about who has

3576
02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:12.950
to play the healer ever again!

3577
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:17.610
Travel the land on a horse whose run cycle utterly screams,

3578
02:12:17.610 --> 02:12:22.105
sweet mercy, this game must be free!

3579
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:27.870
Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II, the game where you pretend

3580
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:31.970
to be adults pretending to be wizards,

3581
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:36.164
like nature intended, hmm.

3582
02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:44.069
(dramatic rock music)

3583
02:12:59.383 --> 02:13:00.865
LIAM: Look at me, I'm Leatherface!

3584
02:13:00.865 --> 02:13:03.282
SAM: (laughs)

3585
02:13:15.210 --> 02:13:16.842
JULIE (V.O.): All Work No Play.

(dramatic folk music)

3588
02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:55.710
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

3589
02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:58.420
BRIAN: It has been 69--

3590
02:13:58.420 --> 02:13:59.320
LAURA: Yay!

3591
02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:03.050
BRIAN: Nice, episodes, 69 episodes, six levels,

3592
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:05.660
and 212 Exandrian days

3593
02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:07.810
since the Nein last saw

3594
02:14:07.810 --> 02:14:09.690
the reformed bandits.
LAURA: (burps)

3595
02:14:09.690 --> 02:14:10.660
Oh god, it's, like, stuck.
MARISHA: That was a

3596
02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:11.830
little bit better.
LAURA: It's stuck!

3597
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:13.269
BRIAN: No, let it out, man.

3598
02:14:13.269 --> 02:14:14.290
LAURA: I can't.

3599
02:14:14.290 --> 02:14:16.440
DANI: You have to pound on your stomach or something.

3600
02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:17.780
LAURA: God.
DANI: Right on your diaphragm.

3601
02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.050
BRIAN: That's what this hour is for.

3602
02:14:20.050 --> 02:14:22.170
LAURA: This hour's just going to be
slowly getting burps out.

3603
02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:23.003
I'm sorry.

3604
02:14:23.003 --> 02:14:25.150
MARISHA: There is a kraken--
LAURA: Because I swallowed

3605
02:14:25.150 --> 02:14:25.983
that first one.
MARISHA: -- in your chest.

3606
02:14:25.983 --> 02:14:28.010
BRIAN: I'm not one to comment on a woman's appearance,

3607
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:29.864
but you look like, uh, (laughs)--

3608
02:14:29.864 --> 02:14:31.740
DANI: Oh god.
LAURA: (laughing)

3609
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.800
BRIAN: You kind of look like Ripley,

3610
02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:37.231
if she unwillingly got, like, a E! Makeover.

3611
02:14:37.231 --> 02:14:39.722
(laughter)

3612
02:14:40.594 --> 02:14:44.554
Then you go, "Well, I guess it's actually kind of cool."

3613
02:14:44.554 --> 02:14:45.740
MARISHA: Oh wow.

3614
02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:46.840
BRIAN: Wow.
LAURA: (snickers)

3615
02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:49.370
MARISHA: I think that was (laughs).

3616
02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:51.590
BRIAN: What? That was sincere.

3617
02:14:51.590 --> 02:14:53.010
MARISHA: No, there's--

3618
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:54.255
BRIAN: Are you still making noise?
MARISHA: I am having

3619
02:14:54.255 --> 02:14:59.255
an audio experience over here.
BRIAN: Jiminy Christmas.

3620
02:14:59.674 --> 02:15:03.250
MARISHA: It's like a Burning Man art installation,

3621
02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:06.300
and you have to be within a certain radius.

3622
02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:08.403
BRIAN: You're no longer America's sweetheart.

3623
02:15:08.403 --> 02:15:09.831
MARISHA: (laughs)
DANI: Lies.

3624
02:15:09.831 --> 02:15:11.649
BRIAN: You're America's sweet-fart.

3625
02:15:11.649 --> 02:15:12.973
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh!

3626
02:15:12.973 --> 02:15:14.310
LAURA: #AmericasSweetFart.

3627
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:15.143
MARISHA: That's good.

3628
02:15:15.143 --> 02:15:16.490
DANI: No, don't make that a hashtag.

3629
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:17.720
LAURA: (laughs)

3630
02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:19.880
BRIAN: Zack, get something drawn up for this week.

3631
02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:20.970
DANI and LAURA: No!

3632
02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:22.550
BRIAN: All right.
LAURA: Don't do it, Zack!

3633
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:23.383
I'm serious.

3634
02:15:23.383 --> 02:15:25.300
I'm serious, I'm serious.
BRIAN: Nope, he has been ordered

3635
02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:26.140
not to listen to you.

3636
02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:28.420
"Marisha, after telling him about the plan

3637
02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:30.440
"to find the fortune teller,

3638
02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:33.940
"does Beau believe her father
genuinely cares for her safety?

3639
02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:35.610
"Or does she think he's just putting on an act

3640
02:15:35.610 --> 02:15:37.260
"for the group of people watching?"

3641
02:15:38.610 --> 02:15:43.610
MARISHA: I think he cares to the extent

3642
02:15:43.785 --> 02:15:47.840
that anyone cares about anyone's general safety.

3643
02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:48.840
LAURA: (laughs)
BRIAN: Right.

3644
02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:49.673
DANI: Oof.

3645
02:15:49.673 --> 02:15:50.830
MARISHA: Does that make sense?

3646
02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:52.960
BRIAN: Sure, like if you saw Laura about

3647
02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:57.170
to trip into the street as a car was coming,

3648
02:15:57.170 --> 02:16:00.650
you grab her shirt, but if you saw some rando,

3649
02:16:00.650 --> 02:16:02.390
you'd be like, "He's kind of far away,

3650
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:03.900
"I don't think I'm going to make it in time.

3651
02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:06.360
"I'll be one of those people that calls the police after."

3652
02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.360
Is that what you mean?

3653
02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.193
DANI: Wow.

3654
02:16:09.193 --> 02:16:10.766
BRIAN: Is that what you mean?
MARISHA: I mean--

3655
02:16:10.766 --> 02:16:12.470
BRIAN: Just to use a real-life example to ground it

3656
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:13.513
for the folks at home.
MARISHA: It's hard to say yes

3657
02:16:13.513 --> 02:16:18.410
to that, but kind of, I guess.

3658
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:19.243
I don't know.

3659
02:16:19.243 --> 02:16:23.430
Yeah, I think he is concerned about himself first.

3660
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:25.850
BRIAN: Yeah. "How much of the Mighty Nein's worry

3661
02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:27.560
"for Jester about the cultness

3662
02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.140
"of the Traveler gets through to her?

3663
02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:32.420
"Does she think any of their worries have a foundation,

3664
02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:35.660
"or does she think they're just well meaning but paranoid?"

3665
02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:38.860
LAURA: Like, she knows he's godly.

3666
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:41.030
She knows how powerful he is.

3667
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:44.281
MARISHA: I can't wait for Traveler Con!
LAURA: I know.

3668
02:16:44.281 --> 02:16:47.283
There is a little bit of like, "Oh, that's weird,"

3669
02:16:47.283 --> 02:16:52.010
like seeing how other gods interact with their constituents,

3670
02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:52.909
whatever you call it.

3671
02:16:52.909 --> 02:16:56.320
BRIAN: Constituents, wow.

3672
02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:59.540
Hello, my constituent, I have heard your plea for help.

3673
02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:02.020
I am here to assist you.
MARISHA: The Traveler is a local,

3674
02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:03.560
small-town politician.

3675
02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:06.900
The other gods are all part of the United Nations,

3676
02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:09.100
and they're like, "Oh, you won with 30 votes?

3677
02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:10.650
"That's adorable."

3678
02:17:10.650 --> 02:17:13.160
BRIAN: "How does it feel to have a fictional family

3679
02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:15.300
"that only acknowledges your accomplishments

3680
02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:19.530
"while they undercut the true personhood behind it.

3681
02:17:19.530 --> 02:17:22.880
"How does Beau differ now from
the young woman in that house?"

3682
02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:25.156
MARISHA: I think Beau's shown a lot of growth,

3683
02:17:25.156 --> 02:17:26.397
like we're talking about.

3684
02:17:26.397 --> 02:17:29.220
I hope so.

3685
02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:33.411
The Mighty Nein has helped Beau

3686
02:17:33.411 --> 02:17:35.211
trust in other people

3687
02:17:35.211 --> 02:17:38.382
around her and come out of her shell

3688
02:17:38.382 --> 02:17:43.010
and learn how to control her outbursts

3689
02:17:43.010 --> 02:17:45.270
and her blaming other people

3690
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:46.337
and her anger.
LAURA: And say thank you.

3691
02:17:46.337 --> 02:17:49.037
MARISHA: And say thank you and sorry.

3692
02:17:49.037 --> 02:17:50.798
LAURA: Yeah, that's a big one.

3693
02:17:50.798 --> 02:17:53.017
MARISHA: (laughs) Good job.

3694
02:17:53.017 --> 02:17:53.850
BRIAN: Thanks, life coach.

3695
02:17:53.850 --> 02:17:55.016
LAURA: You earned it.

3696
02:17:55.016 --> 02:17:56.128
MARISHA: Still practicing.

3697
02:17:56.128 --> 02:17:57.090
LAURA: (laughs)

3698
02:17:57.090 --> 02:17:59.070
MARISHA: But yeah, like, what you were saying.

3699
02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:01.220
It was immediately all those

3700
02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:03.930
like bad thoughts were coming back.

3701
02:18:03.930 --> 02:18:08.930
So it felt like Beau was on the verge of reverting,

3702
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:10.450
that the whole end of that game

3703
02:18:10.450 --> 02:18:11.450
and just, like, fighting it--
LAURA: Nothing makes you

3704
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:16.030
fucking regress to you childhood, like, mannerisms

3705
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:18.050
and behaviors, faster than going home.

3706
02:18:18.050 --> 02:18:19.290
MARISHA: Absolutely.

3707
02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:20.330
BRIAN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Absolutely.

3708
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:22.170
BRIAN: When Marisha gets off the phone with her mom,

3709
02:18:22.170 --> 02:18:24.471
I can barely understand what the fuck she's saying.

3710
02:18:24.471 --> 02:18:27.680
It sounds like some backwoods Irish accent,

3711
02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:29.020
but it's like--
MARISHA: It's so bad.

3712
02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.690
BRIAN: She's speaking Mountain Dew.

3713
02:18:30.690 --> 02:18:31.910
LAURA: No!

3714
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:35.800
BRIAN: "Jester seems okay and
supportive of her mother's job,

3715
02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:37.810
"which involves sleeping with numerous clients."

3716
02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:38.643
LAURA: Sure.

3717
02:18:38.643 --> 02:18:39.476
BRIAN: So does mine.

3718
02:18:39.476 --> 02:18:43.570
"But she has shown strong distaste for her father sleeping

3719
02:18:43.570 --> 02:18:46.370
"with anyone since the parental discovery. Why?"

3720
02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:48.940
LAURA: No, no, no, no, that's inaccurate.

3721
02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:49.840
BRIAN: Okay.

3722
02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:51.450
LAURA: I'm totally okay.

3723
02:18:51.450 --> 02:18:53.800
If he wants to go get his kicks, whatever.

3724
02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:55.510
He can go sleep with people.

3725
02:18:55.510 --> 02:18:58.870
Also, she's okay with people paying to sleep

3726
02:18:58.870 --> 02:19:00.560
with her mom, no big deal.

3727
02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:03.280
However, what you didn't see is, all growing up,

3728
02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:06.950
Jester fucking with everybody that her mom slept with,

3729
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:08.300
getting in trouble for it.

3730
02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:12.220
She consistently gave her clients shit.

3731
02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:14.640
Also, the only time she was unsupportive

3732
02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:17.150
of it is when she saw the woman in the room,

3733
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:19.930
and then she was like, "Get the fuck out," right?

3734
02:19:19.930 --> 02:19:23.120
So yeah, whatever, you can sleep with people.

3735
02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:26.110
Don't form a fucking relationship with them, though.

3736
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:27.920
DANI: You can't stay for breakfast.

3737
02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:28.753
LAURA: Exactly.

3738
02:19:28.753 --> 02:19:29.650
MARISHA: (laughs)

3739
02:19:29.650 --> 02:19:32.040
BRIAN: Rickolas-- nobody's named Rickolas.

3740
02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:34.340
(laughter)

3741
02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.430
Your name is either Rick or Nicholas.

3742
02:19:36.430 --> 02:19:37.990
It's not Rickolas.

3743
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:39.156
That's ridickolas.

3744
02:19:39.156 --> 02:19:41.000
(laughter)

3745
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.440
Rickolas Weishaupt wants to know (clicks),

3746
02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:46.440
somebody should say that backwards.

3747
02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:47.273
Maybe not.

3748
02:19:48.890 --> 02:19:50.930
After--
LAURA: Swoo--

3749
02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:51.840
BRIAN: One more time.

3750
02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:55.840
LAURA: Putah, Putahsew

3751
02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:58.070
Salackir.

3752
02:19:58.070 --> 02:20:00.144
BRIAN: That's right.
DANI: Whoa.

3753
02:20:00.144 --> 02:20:03.105
MARISHA: (laughs) John is dead.

3754
02:20:03.105 --> 02:20:04.080
BRIAN: Yeah, I was going to say,

3755
02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:05.955
somewhere, someone just fell over dead.

3756
02:20:05.955 --> 02:20:09.290
(laughter)

3757
02:20:09.290 --> 02:20:11.770
Somewhere, Taliesin just shot up and went,

3758
02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.330
"Hmm, a fresh one!"

3759
02:20:13.330 --> 02:20:16.134
(laughter)

3760
02:20:16.134 --> 02:20:19.134
(upbeat rock music)

3761
02:20:21.578 --> 02:20:23.610
(crowd cheers)
SAM: Woo-hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

3762
02:20:23.610 --> 02:20:25.650
Yeah, we did it, yeah!

3763
02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.940
DANI: Sam Riegel, you just won the Superbowl.

3764
02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:29.010
What are you going to do now?

3765
02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:32.080
SAM: I'm subscribing to Critical Role, yeah!

3766
02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:33.170
DANI: Wonderful, and that's--

3767
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:35.420
SAM: It's about perseverance, like, remember

3768
02:20:35.420 --> 02:20:38.570
to resubscribe with Twitch Prime, every month, yeah!

3769
02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:39.403
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
DANI: Yes.

3770
02:20:39.403 --> 02:20:40.270
Well, could you--

3771
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:41.650
SAM: Have done it without my teammates?

3772
02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:42.570
Come on, no way!

3773
02:20:42.570 --> 02:20:44.010
And they couldn't have done it

3774
02:20:44.010 --> 02:20:47.000
without the Twitch subscriptions that I gave them.

3775
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:47.860
Right, guys?

3776
02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:48.950
Yeah!
DANI: Okay, Sam,

3777
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:50.170
but what about the--

3778
02:20:50.170 --> 02:20:53.090
SAM: Oh, what about, what about inspires me, you mean?

3779
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:55.130
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

3780
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:57.370
I mean, watching that dehydrated piece

3781
02:20:57.370 --> 02:21:00.680
of string cheese Brian Foster, every couple of weeks,

3782
02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.902
really gets me pumped for the big game!

3783
02:21:02.902 --> 02:21:04.190
SAM: (laughs)
DANI: Sam, hold on.

3784
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:05.270
We have to--
(horn wails)

3785
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:06.650
SAM: You can't believe it?

3786
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:08.110
You can't believe it, is that what you said?

3787
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:09.170
Well, it's true,

3788
02:21:09.170 --> 02:21:12.500
because every Yee-Haw VOD is instantly available,

3789
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.940
as soon as you subscribe.

3790
02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:15.120
It's amazing!
DANI: Sam!

3791
02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:16.380
SAM: We did it, guys.
DANI: Sam!

3792
02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:18.146
SAM: Yeah, yeah!
DANI: Sam!

3793
02:21:18.146 --> 02:21:19.090
SAM: Yeah, what, sorry.

3794
02:21:19.090 --> 02:21:21.490
DANI: Just say, "I'm going to Disneyland."

3795
02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:23.600
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

3796
02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.700
SAM: Oh, uh...

3797
02:21:28.290 --> 02:21:29.327
What's a Disneyland?

3798
02:21:29.327 --> 02:21:31.455
(dramatic music)

3799
02:21:31.455 --> 02:21:34.288
(whistle shrills)

3800
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:37.023
I don't know.

3801
02:21:37.023 --> 02:21:37.990
I got to be honest with you.

3802
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:39.048
DANI: Oh!

3803
02:21:39.048 --> 02:21:41.660
SAM: I got hit in the head pretty hard out there.

3804
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:42.612
DANI: Oh my god.

3805
02:21:42.612 --> 02:21:45.942
SAM: Woo, uh, I'm not good at sports.

3806
02:21:45.942 --> 02:21:48.936
(thudding)
(crowd gasps)

3807
02:21:48.936 --> 02:21:51.519
(crowd cheers)

3808
02:21:55.226 --> 02:21:58.393
(dramatic orchestral music)

3809
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:42.330
MATT: Hello, everyone, welcome back.

3810
02:34:42.330 --> 02:34:44.440
Before we jump into the next half of our session,

3811
02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:46.060
we do have one winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.

3812
02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:49.580
The winner is SRVfan32688.

3813
02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:51.440
SAM: Woo, I love me some SRV!

3814
02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:54.870
MATT: Congratulations, SRVfan32688.

3815
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:57.011
We'll get that sent to you ASAP.

3816
02:34:57.011 --> 02:34:58.057
LIAM: (through cupped hands) Move along.

3817
02:34:58.057 --> 02:35:00.060
(laughter)

3818
02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:00.893
MATT: All righty.

3819
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:05.681
So as you guys

3820
02:35:05.681 --> 02:35:07.522
have trekked your way up

3821
02:35:07.522 --> 02:35:10.100
towards the base of the mountain, looking through the mist,

3822
02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:13.290
you can see the rickety cabin-like abode

3823
02:35:13.290 --> 02:35:17.060
that rests before you, amongst the rocky

3824
02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:19.180
and forest-covered hill.

3825
02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:21.780
What would you like to do?

3826
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:27.600
MARISHA: Should we rest now?

3827
02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:28.433
This is dumb.

3828
02:35:28.433 --> 02:35:30.050
It's dumb to rest right here, right?

3829
02:35:30.050 --> 02:35:32.010
LIAM: In view of her shack?

3830
02:35:32.010 --> 02:35:33.990
LAURA: Like, an actual rest?

3831
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:35.640
SAM: Like, go to sleep in front of her house?

3832
02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:36.510
MARISHA: There's no way.
LAURA: No way.

3833
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:38.250
She's going to come up in the middle of the night

3834
02:35:38.250 --> 02:35:39.490
and kill us all.

3835
02:35:39.490 --> 02:35:41.890
LIAM: How many feet, roughly, are we from this home?

3836
02:35:41.890 --> 02:35:43.355
MATT: You're about 60 or so feet.

3837
02:35:43.355 --> 02:35:45.380
(laughter)
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3838
02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:46.380
MATT: About 100 feet.

3839
02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:48.200
LIAM: I start putting up the wire.

3840
02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:50.210
MATT: We'll say about 100 and so feet

3841
02:35:50.210 --> 02:35:52.370
before the mist reveals the shape,

3842
02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:53.850
and you begin to see what's ahead of you.

3843
02:35:53.850 --> 02:35:56.170
TRAVIS: How about we split into two parties,

3844
02:35:56.170 --> 02:35:59.660
and we wrap around the house and meet on the backside?

3845
02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:00.826
MARISHA: Do a scout?

3846
02:36:01.770 --> 02:36:02.800
TALIESIN: Why?

3847
02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:04.160
TRAVIS: To see what's around the house.

3848
02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:06.310
MARISHA: Yeah, get the perimeters, man.

3849
02:36:06.310 --> 02:36:09.240
LAURA: Why don't we just send Frumpkin over there and see?

3850
02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:11.080
TRAVIS: Sure.
SAM: He can't see anything.

3851
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:13.510
TRAVIS: That, too. Let's try that first.

3852
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:15.270
LAURA: Well, I just don't want to separate,

3853
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:18.590
just because this lady's really powerful,

3854
02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:19.930
and I have a feeling she'd--

3855
02:36:19.930 --> 02:36:20.880
LIAM: I think you have the right idea.

3856
02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:23.180
I mean, we're not sending him to solve a mystery.

3857
02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:25.830
We just want to see the other side of the home, yeah?

3858
02:36:26.926 --> 02:36:30.370
LIAM: (whooshes, flutters)

3859
02:36:30.370 --> 02:36:33.080
Frumpkin goes up and just starts to circle above the home.

3860
02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.610
MATT: Okay, perception check from Frumpkin.

3861
02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:36.660
LIAM: Come on, you dumb, fucking cat-bird.

3862
02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:37.610
TRAVIS: Make it above a five.

3863
02:36:37.610 --> 02:36:38.443
LIAM: That's cocked, right?

3864
02:36:38.443 --> 02:36:39.690
MARISHA: That is hella cocked.
MATT: It is cocked, yeah.

3865
02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:43.710
LIAM: Super cocked, super cocked. That's good for Frumpkin.

3866
02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:46.247
MARISHA: Oh good job, Frumpy.
LIAM: And that's a 15.

3867
02:36:46.247 --> 02:36:47.659
MARISHA: Aw!
MATT: 15.

3868
02:36:47.659 --> 02:36:48.651
LIAM: Best ever, yay.

3869
02:36:48.651 --> 02:36:50.620
(laughter)

3870
02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:52.450
MATT: As Frumpkin does a pass of the area,

3871
02:36:52.450 --> 02:36:55.500
you can see a number of the treetops around.

3872
02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:57.893
There are trees in this area that

3873
02:36:57.893 --> 02:36:59.850
aren't as closely knitted as a lot

3874
02:36:59.850 --> 02:37:03.420
of the previous forest you've traversed, on your way here.

3875
02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:07.160
You do see the little hut.

3876
02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:10.010
You can see the remnants of a stone chimney.

3877
02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:13.980
Frumpkin looks around and doesn't see anything moving

3878
02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:15.540
on the outside, and from the back.

3879
02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:18.610
There's a small barrel on one side

3880
02:37:18.610 --> 02:37:19.970
of a cluster

3881
02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:24.690
of small boxes, on the other.

3882
02:37:24.690 --> 02:37:26.450
Beyond that (burps), pardon me,

3883
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:29.380
no signs of movement.
LIAM: No movement of any kind.

3884
02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:31.570
TRAVIS: Did it look like there was a backdoor?

3885
02:37:31.570 --> 02:37:32.403
LIAM: Yeah.

3886
02:37:32.403 --> 02:37:33.513
MATT: No backdoor.
LIAM: No backdoor.

3887
02:37:33.513 --> 02:37:35.460
MATT: Just the front entrance.
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you doing?

3888
02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:36.982
SAM: We're listening to Matt.

3889
02:37:36.982 --> 02:37:39.230
(laughter)

3890
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:40.842
MATT: Good.

3891
02:37:40.842 --> 02:37:42.550
TRAVIS: We're about to die by hag.

3892
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:44.750
MARISHA: They're like the third row in the minivan,

3893
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:47.220
hella far back.

3894
02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:49.500
LIAM: Caleb can't hear anything, but he's muttering

3895
02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:51.480
to Beauregard the things that he sees.

3896
02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:54.070
Yeah, those boxes, I don't know what's in them.

3897
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:55.970
I don't see a door.

3898
02:37:55.970 --> 02:37:57.490
This cat is good for something.

3899
02:37:57.490 --> 02:38:00.090
MARISHA: This cat is a fucking shitbag.

3900
02:38:00.090 --> 02:38:01.660
LAURA: That cat is a bird.

3901
02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:03.000
MARISHA: The cat sucks.

3902
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.285
LAURA: Can he hear us?

3903
02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:06.220
Can he hear us?

3904
02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:07.670
I can't remember.
SAM: No, he can't.

3905
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:09.267
MARISHA: He's only there.

3906
02:38:09.267 --> 02:38:10.810
SAM: He can feel if you tug.

3907
02:38:10.810 --> 02:38:12.262
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: (laughs)

3908
02:38:12.262 --> 02:38:13.706
(laughter)

3909
02:38:13.706 --> 02:38:14.539
SAM: I, I--

3910
02:38:14.539 --> 02:38:15.539
LIAM: I'm not as stoic as Caleb.

3911
02:38:15.539 --> 02:38:16.500
(laughter)

3912
02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:18.268
MARISHA: We're way safe.

3913
02:38:18.268 --> 02:38:23.243
(laughter)

3914
02:38:26.423 --> 02:38:28.690
LIAM: (whooshes) Yeah, okay.

3915
02:38:28.690 --> 02:38:29.980
MARISHA: Your cat's great.

3916
02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:31.110
LIAM: This is the best cat.

3917
02:38:31.110 --> 02:38:31.943
MARISHA: Yeah.

3918
02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:33.633
LIAM: I wish he would come back.

3919
02:38:33.633 --> 02:38:35.040
SAM: Did you find anything?

3920
02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.790
LIAM: Yeah, there's a back area

3921
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:40.450
and a bunch of shit piled up outside the door.

3922
02:38:40.450 --> 02:38:44.017
There is no door, I'm sorry, piled up in the back.

3923
02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:47.850
Was it walled in, in any way, when I looked back there,

3924
02:38:47.850 --> 02:38:49.110
or was does it just keep stretching on

3925
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:50.460
into wilderness, behind it?

3926
02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:52.787
MATT: It just continues on, into wilderness.

3927
02:38:52.787 --> 02:38:53.922
LIAM: Okay.

3928
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:58.150
So one entrance that we know of.

3929
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:59.070
SAM: Just the front door.

3930
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.960
LAURA: What about windows?

3931
02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.700
Were there windows?

3932
02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:03.070
LIAM: Were there windows?

3933
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:05.050
MATT: No windows, just the front entrance.

3934
02:39:05.050 --> 02:39:06.030
LIAM: No.

3935
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:07.330
SAM: That's a creepy house.

3936
02:39:07.330 --> 02:39:08.370
Who would design a house

3937
02:39:08.370 --> 02:39:10.490
without any windows or natural light?

3938
02:39:10.490 --> 02:39:11.610
LAURA: Probably a witch.

3939
02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:13.810
ASHLEY: We could just go knock.

3940
02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:16.420
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3941
02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:18.282
MARISHA: I'm kind of into that.

3942
02:39:18.282 --> 02:39:19.140
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

3943
02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:20.494
SAM: Should we leave some people

3944
02:39:20.494 --> 02:39:23.050
as a reserve, outside or something?

3945
02:39:23.050 --> 02:39:23.883
TRAVIS: Why?
LAURA: No.

3946
02:39:23.883 --> 02:39:26.690
If we all go in, we all go in.

3947
02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:28.373
What?

3948
02:39:28.373 --> 02:39:30.420
MARISHA: Yeah, Jester already said don't split the party?

3949
02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:31.632
LAURA: Yeah.

3950
02:39:31.632 --> 02:39:35.960
TALIESIN: I think any attempt at deceit would end poorly.

3951
02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:37.850
LAURA: This lady saw me scrying on her.

3952
02:39:37.850 --> 02:39:39.490
She's, like, super observant.

3953
02:39:39.490 --> 02:39:42.290
MARISHA: She's been watching our
every move coming here, right?

3954
02:39:42.290 --> 02:39:43.670
LAURA: I'm assuming so.
LIAM: She could watching us,

3955
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:44.503
right now.

3956
02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:47.266
MARISHA: Hi!

3957
02:39:48.447 --> 02:39:50.210
TRAVIS: Are you just calling out, 60 feet away?

3958
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:51.390
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It's 60 feet.

3959
02:39:51.390 --> 02:39:53.056
How loud can you go?
TALIESIN: 100 feet.

3960
02:39:53.056 --> 02:39:53.980
MARISHA: Hi.

3961
02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:55.560
TRAVIS: Louder. What the fuck?

3962
02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:57.430
LAURA: She can probably hear.
MARISHA: She knows, right?

3963
02:39:57.430 --> 02:39:58.263
TALIESIN: That's true.

3964
02:39:58.263 --> 02:40:00.250
Let's just walk.
MARISHA: You know?

3965
02:40:00.250 --> 02:40:01.083
Do I hear anything?

3966
02:40:01.083 --> 02:40:01.970
Do I feel anything?

3967
02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:04.770
Do I feel special?
MATT: Make a perception check.

3968
02:40:04.770 --> 02:40:05.960
TRAVIS: Do I feel special?

3969
02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:07.867
LIAM: Well, you're a D&amp;D character,

3970
02:40:07.867 --> 02:40:08.700
so yeah.
MARISHA: 18.

3971
02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:09.980
MATT: You feel very special.

3972
02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:10.870
MARISHA: I feel very special?

3973
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:12.226
MATT: But you don't hear anything.

3974
02:40:12.226 --> 02:40:13.610
MARISHA: (sighs)

3975
02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:15.443
MARISHA: You're right.
TRAVIS: Yasha, shall we?

3976
02:40:16.450 --> 02:40:17.830
ASHLEY: Let's go.
TRAVIS: All right.

3977
02:40:17.830 --> 02:40:19.948
Yasha and I start walking up to the door.

3978
02:40:19.948 --> 02:40:22.710
TALIESIN: I follow.
MARISHA: I follow.

3979
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:23.543
Jester!

3980
02:40:23.543 --> 02:40:24.650
LAURA: Huh?
MARISHA: Come on!

3981
02:40:24.650 --> 02:40:26.490
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Caleb!

3982
02:40:26.490 --> 02:40:29.660
LIAM: Caleb's double branches away from the group

3983
02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:32.340
and goes to the corner of the house, to the side,

3984
02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:34.590
and then just sort of stays at the front,

3985
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:36.528
peeking around the front--

3986
02:40:36.528 --> 02:40:38.106
MARISHA: (whispers) Nott!
LIAM: --as the group goes up.

3987
02:40:38.106 --> 02:40:39.013
MATT: All right.

3988
02:40:39.013 --> 02:40:39.846
SAM: What?

3989
02:40:39.846 --> 02:40:41.099
MARISHA: Come on.

3990
02:40:41.099 --> 02:40:41.932
LAURA: We're all going.

3991
02:40:41.932 --> 02:40:42.850
Are you going or no?
SAM: I'm going to go invisible.

3992
02:40:42.850 --> 02:40:44.230
I'm going invisible.

3993
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:45.810
MARISHA: But she--
LAURA: It's fine.

3994
02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:46.980
She'll still be able to see you,

3995
02:40:46.980 --> 02:40:48.930
but if you feel more comfortable, whatever.

3996
02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:50.530
SAM: She can't do everything.

3997
02:40:50.530 --> 02:40:51.840
LAURA: She can see things like that.

3998
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:52.700
SAM: You don't know anything about her.

3999
02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:54.250
LAURA: I know!

4000
02:40:54.250 --> 02:40:55.190
LIAM: And Frumpkin is just circling.

4001
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:56.990
SAM: I'm doing this, but I'm invisible.

4002
02:40:58.120 --> 02:40:58.953
TALIESIN: We know.

4003
02:40:58.953 --> 02:40:59.910
(laughter)

4004
02:40:59.910 --> 02:41:01.410
SAM: Shit!

4005
02:41:01.410 --> 02:41:04.510
MATT: So who's doing what then?

4006
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:05.343
You've...

4007
02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:07.570
LIAM: Smoothy McGee over here.

4008
02:41:07.570 --> 02:41:08.403
MARISHA: They were firsties.

4009
02:41:08.403 --> 02:41:10.080
TRAVIS: Yasha and I are at the door.

4010
02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:10.960
MATT: So you guys approach.

4011
02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.000
It is a bit of a climb.

4012
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.380
There's a bit of a a rocky incline

4013
02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:19.280
that you head up to the front of this small abode.

4014
02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:21.990
In the base of it, you see heavy roots emerging from it,

4015
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:25.140
like the house is rooted into the ground.

4016
02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:29.190
TALIESIN: Literally going to discuss you.

4017
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:32.210
I don't know how invisibility is...

4018
02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:33.900
Your name is going to instantly come up.

4019
02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:35.490
SAM: Ooh, the wind.
MATT: The two of you make

4020
02:41:35.490 --> 02:41:38.720
your way up to the pouch-- the pouch-- the porch.

4021
02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:40.520
Looking upon the porch in front of you,

4022
02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:42.860
you can see the fronts lift about waist high,

4023
02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:44.520
with these dividers.

4024
02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:47.350
There's the opening on the inside, onto the porch.

4025
02:41:47.350 --> 02:41:49.750
Then there is the partially ajar door

4026
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:53.560
and the warmly-lit interior of the hut.

4027
02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.530
LAURA: This is so stupid.
TRAVIS: Open door.

4028
02:41:56.530 --> 02:41:58.260
ASHLEY: Knock or just open the door?

4029
02:41:58.260 --> 02:41:59.770
LAURA: We should knock.
TRAVIS: Can you see in

4030
02:41:59.770 --> 02:42:00.825
through the doorway?

4031
02:42:00.825 --> 02:42:01.658
MATT: Yeah.

4032
02:42:01.658 --> 02:42:02.491
TRAVIS: It's open.

4033
02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:04.520
ASHLEY: But I feel like we shouldn't--

4034
02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:06.090
LAURA: Oh, there's no door?

4035
02:42:06.090 --> 02:42:07.503
MATT: The door is there, but it's partially open.

4036
02:42:07.503 --> 02:42:08.510
LAURA: Oh, ooh.

4037
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:09.810
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll go up and...

4038
02:42:11.682 --> 02:42:13.646
(knuckles rapping)

4039
02:42:13.646 --> 02:42:14.550
LAURA: Oh, you know what I should've done?

4040
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:16.080
MATT: You knock on the partially ajar door,

4041
02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:19.765
and it (squeaks) opens, ever so slightly more,

4042
02:42:19.765 --> 02:42:22.665
and you can see a little bit, in the inside.

4043
02:42:22.665 --> 02:42:24.910
The house appears to be empty, or at the very least,

4044
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:26.778
there's nobody inside of it.

4045
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:33.110
Within, you can see the inside's both warm and muggy.

4046
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:35.150
The smell intensely reminiscent

4047
02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:37.660
of strong mildew and herbs, almost.

4048
02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:40.890
It's not too terribly large.

4049
02:42:40.890 --> 02:42:41.723
Now that you've gotten close to it,

4050
02:42:41.723 --> 02:42:45.160
you can see it's about 18 or so feet, end to end,

4051
02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:50.160
maybe 20 or so feet, and about 15 feet wide or deep.

4052
02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:52.970
From what you can see, there's a table

4053
02:42:52.970 --> 02:42:55.210
in the middle of the room that has a lantern,

4054
02:42:55.210 --> 02:42:56.480
a single lantern on it, that's glowing,

4055
02:42:56.480 --> 02:42:59.000
and it's where the light source is emanating from.

4056
02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.160
There are a smattering of all sort of strange collectibles

4057
02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:05.160
and piles in the corner, just shoved inside,

4058
02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:08.390
chaotically organized, intently placed,

4059
02:43:08.390 --> 02:43:11.930
but in a somewhat messy way.

4060
02:43:11.930 --> 02:43:14.970
Kind of glancing along the ceiling on the inside,

4061
02:43:14.970 --> 02:43:17.520
between where the wooden boards hold up the thatch,

4062
02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:22.880
you can see hanging from chains and rope and twine,

4063
02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.090
cages of different sizes, all dangling.

4064
02:43:27.090 --> 02:43:29.760
The largest, they're about that big.

4065
02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:33.820
Some are smaller, and they're carried at different heights.

4066
02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:35.970
LAURA: She's going to shrink us down and put us in cages.

4067
02:43:35.970 --> 02:43:36.803
I can tell.
TRAVIS: She's a trapper.

4068
02:43:36.803 --> 02:43:39.130
I'll cast See Invisibility.

4069
02:43:39.130 --> 02:43:40.474
MATT: Cast See Invisibility?
MARISHA: Oh, good call, yes!

4070
02:43:40.474 --> 02:43:41.740
MATT: Okay.

4071
02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:46.370
You cast See Invisibility, and you look inside the home.

4072
02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:48.353
You don't see anything.

4073
02:43:48.353 --> 02:43:49.670
TRAVIS: She doesn't appear to be home.

4074
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:51.200
We certainly don't want to be in her house

4075
02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:52.560
when she comes home.

4076
02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:54.260
Does someone want to come in and investigate quicker,

4077
02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:56.730
while the rest of us wait out front?

4078
02:43:56.730 --> 02:43:59.370
SAM: Oh fuck, okay.
LAURA: Go.

4079
02:43:59.370 --> 02:44:01.720
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: I'll do a quick scan.

4080
02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:03.160
Nott, you take left.

4081
02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:03.993
I'll take right.

4082
02:44:03.993 --> 02:44:05.590
TRAVIS: We will all step out, except for Nott and Beau.

4083
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:07.520
LAURA: But we'll stand in front of the door.

4084
02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:08.570
TRAVIS: On the ground, yeah,

4085
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:10.920
and off the porch.
MARISHA: I do a quick like--

4086
02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:12.470
MATT: Okay, so you guys are all stepping off the porch

4087
02:44:12.470 --> 02:44:14.360
and staying away, while they're going inside?

4088
02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:15.900
Okay, so Beau and Nott--

4089
02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:17.160
SAM: Shouldn't we check for traps or anything, first?

4090
02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:17.993
ASHLEY: That makes me nervous.
MARISHA: I don't know

4091
02:44:17.993 --> 02:44:19.350
if we have time.
SAM: Okay.

4092
02:44:19.350 --> 02:44:22.480
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand between, in the threshold.

4093
02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:23.313
MATT: Okay, so you stand

4094
02:44:23.313 --> 02:44:24.360
in the threshold of the room.

4095
02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:25.970
TALIESIN: I'm going to stick my head in really quick

4096
02:44:25.970 --> 02:44:27.090
and cast Detect Magic.

4097
02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:28.820
LAURA: Wow.

4098
02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:32.340
MATT: Okay, well, let's handle this one at a time here.

4099
02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:35.180
So you guys enter the room and start investigating.

4100
02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:36.705
You cast Detect Magic.

4101
02:44:38.220 --> 02:44:42.670
You sense a number of faint magical auras.

4102
02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:43.503
TALIESIN: Sure.

4103
02:44:43.503 --> 02:44:45.730
MATT: Kind of up in the roof region.

4104
02:44:47.513 --> 02:44:50.860
I think a handful of things and what you can see on a shelf.

4105
02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:51.980
As you go through the door

4106
02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:52.980
and look on the opposite side of the door,

4107
02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:54.630
as you guys investigate as well,

4108
02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:56.900
there are two shelves that are just lined

4109
02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:00.900
with all manner of jars, all different sizes.

4110
02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:04.030
Some of them have bits of rope tied to the top

4111
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:06.050
with some sort of rubber-like substance capping the top.

4112
02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:07.350
Some are sealed shut.

4113
02:45:07.350 --> 02:45:09.510
Some, there's leather wrapped around it,

4114
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:11.510
and they are different colors and colorations.

4115
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:13.010
Some are just different colored glass.

4116
02:45:13.010 --> 02:45:14.410
Some are stained from the inside

4117
02:45:14.410 --> 02:45:15.820
of whatever they're containing.

4118
02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:18.380
But there are dozens and dozens of this strange collection

4119
02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:20.787
of all sorts of things.

4120
02:45:22.895 --> 02:45:24.530
So that's what you detect in the vicinity.

4121
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:26.280
TALIESIN: Gotcha.
MATT: Bits and pieces of it.

4122
02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:27.328
TALIESIN: All right, back out.

4123
02:45:27.328 --> 02:45:28.620
SAM: (sighs)

4124
02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:30.540
MATT: The rest of you guys are outside?

4125
02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:31.373
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

4126
02:45:31.373 --> 02:45:33.720
MATT: Okay, what are you guys investigating?

4127
02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:36.050
SAM: You said those jars are on
the left or the right or both?

4128
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:37.170
MATT: They're both on the left-hand side,

4129
02:45:37.170 --> 02:45:38.360
against the wall, in the back.

4130
02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:39.468
SAM: That's my side.

4131
02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:41.967
Shit (laughs).

4132
02:45:41.967 --> 02:45:43.250
MARISHA: I can't help you.
SAM: I'm going to go for those jars

4133
02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:44.350
and investigate them.

4134
02:45:44.350 --> 02:45:47.380
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

4135
02:45:47.380 --> 02:45:49.980
SAM: I will use my Reliable Talent.

4136
02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:52.160
Oh wait, this is a disadvantage roll.

4137
02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:57.160
Yes, I will still use my Reliable Talent to get a 21.

4138
02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:58.901
MATT: Yeah, okay.

4139
02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:01.850
There's nothing hidden on this side of the room.

4140
02:46:01.850 --> 02:46:06.170
It's just a bit cluttered, but you have all of these jars

4141
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:09.750
and small glass objects that contain all manner of things,

4142
02:46:09.750 --> 02:46:12.100
as well as the cages, as you look around.

4143
02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:14.940
Within the jars, there are all sorts of herbs and materials.

4144
02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:18.320
You, as an alchemist, would recognize a few of them,

4145
02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:19.230
without even having to roll.

4146
02:46:19.230 --> 02:46:20.063
There's mugwort.

4147
02:46:20.063 --> 02:46:20.896
There's wormwood.

4148
02:46:20.896 --> 02:46:21.729
There's blackroot.

4149
02:46:21.729 --> 02:46:23.810
There's a little bit of powdered silver in a small pouch.

4150
02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:26.520
You can see there's hindergale and gallowrind mushroom

4151
02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:29.250
and a collection of snake venom in one.

4152
02:46:29.250 --> 02:46:32.180
There's a gnarled hand in one jar

4153
02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:35.040
that's gray and withered, and it's kept in a liquid,

4154
02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:36.190
that just shakes.

4155
02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:42.040
You can see, up in the cages above, there are creatures

4156
02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:45.060
that you hear shift in one of the cages,

4157
02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:46.590
and you glance up, and you can see

4158
02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:48.470
a bat of some kind.

4159
02:46:48.470 --> 02:46:50.870
It's hanging in one cage, upside down.

4160
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:52.050
You can see another one there.

4161
02:46:52.050 --> 02:46:55.170
There's a hint of a blue tail of a lizard that's poking out.

4162
02:46:55.170 --> 02:46:57.590
So there are creatures up in those cages,

4163
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:58.910
but you don't have quite the full vantage point.

4164
02:46:58.910 --> 02:47:00.910
You just noticed a few of them in there.

4165
02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:03.760
SAM: Okay.
MATT: Beauregard?

4166
02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:05.510
SAM: I'll just whisper over to Beauregard,

4167
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:08.640
some animals and some magic components.

4168
02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:09.473
That's it.

4169
02:47:10.650 --> 02:47:11.520
What you got?

4170
02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:13.040
MARISHA: I'm looking

4171
02:47:15.343 --> 02:47:16.176
with disadvantage, right?

4172
02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:18.353
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4173
02:47:18.353 --> 02:47:19.770
MARISHA: 24.
SAM: Hot damn.

4174
02:47:19.770 --> 02:47:22.020
MATT: 24, okay, you guys are good.

4175
02:47:23.050 --> 02:47:24.880
Glancing on the opposite end, looking at the table,

4176
02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:26.940
you can see the table has been recently cleared,

4177
02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:28.680
other than the lantern that's set there in the middle

4178
02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:30.310
that's lighting the room.

4179
02:47:30.310 --> 02:47:33.140
There are stains across the front of the table itself

4180
02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:37.450
where various brackish liquids have been spilled and left

4181
02:47:37.450 --> 02:47:39.810
to sit in and as such stained the wood on top.

4182
02:47:39.810 --> 02:47:40.780
There are grooves

4183
02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:42.310
and scratches across it, all different sizes

4184
02:47:42.310 --> 02:47:43.143
and lengths--
MARISHA: It was 23.

4185
02:47:43.143 --> 02:47:44.370
I feel so compelled to be honest.

4186
02:47:44.370 --> 02:47:45.330
It was 23.

4187
02:47:45.330 --> 02:47:46.163
Sorry, keep going.

4188
02:47:46.163 --> 02:47:47.220
MATT: Okay, no worries.

4189
02:47:47.220 --> 02:47:48.247
MARISHA: Keep going.

4190
02:47:48.247 --> 02:47:50.940
MATT: It's not going to be a huge difference, it's fine.

4191
02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:52.840
But you do notice that it looks like things were moved

4192
02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:55.150
from here recently.

4193
02:47:55.150 --> 02:47:57.820
You can see areas where dust had gathered,

4194
02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.770
and things were placed in areas of that corner of the room,

4195
02:48:02.910 --> 02:48:04.620
where there are circles in different shapes,

4196
02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:07.230
on the ground and on another shelf,

4197
02:48:07.230 --> 02:48:09.470
that the dust is not there.

4198
02:48:09.470 --> 02:48:12.900
So some things have been moved.

4199
02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:16.500
You also see all manner of small wooden platforms

4200
02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:18.700
that emerge from parts of the wood that have melted wax,

4201
02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:22.210
just dripping down the sides, like candles over time

4202
02:48:22.210 --> 02:48:23.930
that have been replaced, replaced and replaced.

4203
02:48:23.930 --> 02:48:26.410
Looking around the side, there's dozens

4204
02:48:26.410 --> 02:48:30.170
and dozens of these long, slowly building on themselves,

4205
02:48:30.170 --> 02:48:33.900
frozen waterfalls of wax that drip down the walls,

4206
02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:36.300
probably about 14 or so of these throughout the room,

4207
02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:38.050
at different heights and locations.

4208
02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:40.780
You were too focused on the jars

4209
02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:42.270
to notice them originally, but you both

4210
02:48:42.270 --> 02:48:45.080
see it's surrounding the entire interior chamber.

4211
02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:47.230
ASHLEY: Is there anything on the ground in there?

4212
02:48:49.903 --> 02:48:50.880
Dirt of any sort?

4213
02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:52.450
SAM: Normal stuff, I mean, yeah,

4214
02:48:52.450 --> 02:48:54.180
take a look.
MARISHA: Anything on the ground?

4215
02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:57.320
Can we assist each other as we both crawl to the middle?

4216
02:48:57.320 --> 02:48:59.180
MATT: Yeah, you looked underneath the table.

4217
02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:01.478
It's pretty clear beneath the table.

4218
02:49:01.478 --> 02:49:03.090
Yes, and it looks like some things have been removed

4219
02:49:03.090 --> 02:49:05.000
from and placed in--

4220
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.350
MARISHA: She just grabbed stuff recently.

4221
02:49:06.350 --> 02:49:07.220
TRAVIS: While they're doing that,

4222
02:49:07.220 --> 02:49:09.000
can we check the treelines outside?

4223
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.120
MATT: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah, keeping an eye out.

4224
02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:12.280
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Frumpkin's circling.

4225
02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:13.940
MATT: So it's getting dark now.

4226
02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:15.240
Dusk is hitting.

4227
02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:16.540
There's a bit of a sunset.

4228
02:49:17.734 --> 02:49:20.097
While you still have a cloudy sky,

4229
02:49:20.097 --> 02:49:21.660
you can see the coloration shifting a little more

4230
02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:23.890
to a purple, and it is getting visibly darker.

4231
02:49:23.890 --> 02:49:28.260
So you probably have another (sighs) 20 or so minutes,

4232
02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:30.705
before you start really losing light.

4233
02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:33.850
As you guys walk out past the porch

4234
02:49:33.850 --> 02:49:36.700
and head down the pathway and look over the treeline,

4235
02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:39.466
Fjord, as you glance back towards

4236
02:49:41.016 --> 02:49:42.674
the house, you see,

4237
02:49:42.674 --> 02:49:46.350
on the roof, crouched and looming over the front of it,

4238
02:49:46.350 --> 02:49:51.350
arms trailing, cloak and hood up, perched,

4239
02:49:51.650 --> 02:49:55.670
a massive female humanoid form

4240
02:49:56.650 --> 02:49:59.410
that has just knees up beneath the robe,

4241
02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:03.890
weird, unnaturally long arms curled over the edge,

4242
02:50:03.890 --> 02:50:07.775
just sitting and smiling and watching.

4243
02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:11.480
TRAVIS: Right.

4244
02:50:12.904 --> 02:50:15.785
(coughs) Isharnai!

4245
02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:20.330
MATT: The creature's arms unfurl a bit and grab.

4246
02:50:20.330 --> 02:50:21.654
Make a perception check.

4247
02:50:21.654 --> 02:50:23.902
LAURA: (groans)

4248
02:50:23.902 --> 02:50:25.430
Oh no.

4249
02:50:25.430 --> 02:50:27.455
TRAVIS: 11.
MATT: 11.

4250
02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:33.400
As the arms move back and grasp the front edges

4251
02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:38.060
of the roof, there's something very unnatural

4252
02:50:38.060 --> 02:50:38.980
in the way the arms--

4253
02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:42.290
like each arm has two elbows, where it seems

4254
02:50:42.290 --> 02:50:44.940
to bend and then unbend, as it grabs.

4255
02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:46.450
LAURA: Do I see her yet?

4256
02:50:46.450 --> 02:50:48.150
MATT: Nope, none of you see her.

4257
02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:49.550
LAURA: Well, I was with Fjord.

4258
02:50:49.550 --> 02:50:50.400
MATT: Right.

4259
02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:51.233
LAURA: Whoa.

4260
02:50:51.233 --> 02:50:52.640
MATT: You see Fjord say this--

4261
02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:54.848
TRAVIS: To something in the air.

4262
02:50:55.862 --> 02:50:57.460
LAURA: She's invisible.

4263
02:50:57.460 --> 02:50:59.030
MATT: As soon as you said that name,

4264
02:50:59.030 --> 02:51:02.540
the head looks right to you.

4265
02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:06.270
You can see from the tattered lengths of black, oily hair

4266
02:51:06.270 --> 02:51:08.810
that spill from underneath the hood

4267
02:51:08.810 --> 02:51:11.030
and the long, pointed jaw

4268
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:14.260
where the jowls hang a bit, at the back,

4269
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:17.990
but the high cheekbones pull

4270
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:20.670
in an almost mockery of elvish features.

4271
02:51:20.670 --> 02:51:22.860
The deep-set green eyes almost glowing

4272
02:51:22.860 --> 02:51:25.660
from within the shaded hood, piercing right towards you.

4273
02:51:27.034 --> 02:51:28.430
LAURA: Mm, mm-mm.

4274
02:51:28.430 --> 02:51:30.460
TRAVIS: We come seeking a conversation.

4275
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:32.670
LAURA: Would you say that she looks

4276
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:34.601
like the Ring girl, only old?

4277
02:51:34.601 --> 02:51:37.490
MATT: (laughs)

4278
02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:39.650
MATT: Old, swollen and six-foot-five, hunched.

4279
02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:40.883
LAURA: Sweet.

4280
02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:45.630
MATT: (as Isharnai) "Interesting."

4281
02:51:45.630 --> 02:51:46.463
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

4282
02:51:47.650 --> 02:51:50.010
MATT: You all hear this now.

4283
02:51:50.010 --> 02:51:52.690
While she speaks, it's almost vibrating

4284
02:51:52.690 --> 02:51:55.110
around you, sourcelessly.

4285
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.943
Even within the house,

4286
02:51:55.943 --> 02:51:58.000
it feels like it's coming from the walls,

4287
02:51:58.000 --> 02:51:58.957
but you all turn,

4288
02:51:58.957 --> 02:52:00.320
and you can sense the source a bit,

4289
02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:03.350
coming from the house, but you cannot see anything.

4290
02:52:03.350 --> 02:52:07.375
"Which of you visited me

4291
02:52:07.375 --> 02:52:11.283
"from afar, these past days?

4292
02:52:11.283 --> 02:52:14.533
"I would like to see the face

4293
02:52:14.533 --> 02:52:18.233
"that held the prying eye."

4294
02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:24.167
LAURA: Are you guys actually going to look at me like that?

4295
02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:27.062
Are you looking at me?

4296
02:52:27.062 --> 02:52:27.895
Gulp.

4297
02:52:27.895 --> 02:52:30.395
(laughter)

4298
02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:44.397
MATT: What you guys see is suddenly

4299
02:52:44.397 --> 02:52:47.197
there is a cracking shift

4300
02:52:47.197 --> 02:52:49.940
of wood and thatch, and you see dust

4301
02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:51.700
and moss fall from the roof,

4302
02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:55.580
as you watch her (whoosh) leap into the air.

4303
02:52:56.470 --> 02:52:57.990
You feel on the ground next to you,

4304
02:52:57.990 --> 02:53:00.430
as dust (poof) dissipates out,

4305
02:53:01.730 --> 02:53:04.190
you sense a presence, immediately to your left.

4306
02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:07.170
You watch her leap 15 feet in the air,

4307
02:53:07.170 --> 02:53:10.390
and with an impact, slam into the ground next to Jester

4308
02:53:10.390 --> 02:53:13.050
and then come back to her full hunched height,

4309
02:53:13.050 --> 02:53:13.980
looming over her.

4310
02:53:13.980 --> 02:53:15.505
TRAVIS: What's her posture like?

4311
02:53:17.636 --> 02:53:18.940
MATT: From the robes that you can tell,

4312
02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:22.630
and there are a number of, from what you can see close-up,

4313
02:53:22.630 --> 02:53:25.720
the gray-brown coloring of the stained cloak

4314
02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:29.040
that goes over the darker beneath robes,

4315
02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:30.410
there's ratty gold twine

4316
02:53:30.410 --> 02:53:32.110
that's wrapped around parts of the arms,

4317
02:53:32.110 --> 02:53:33.570
and the wrists holding it

4318
02:53:33.570 --> 02:53:34.960
and clutching it in places, to the body,

4319
02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:36.160
and crossing around the chest,

4320
02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:38.880
like it's holding the billowing robe close

4321
02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:40.943
to the form for movement.

4322
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:46.900
The body is curved backward

4323
02:53:46.900 --> 02:53:49.870
in an S-formation, where the front

4324
02:53:49.870 --> 02:53:52.880
of the torso pulls back like a serpent,

4325
02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:55.330
and then the shoulders slouch forward,

4326
02:53:55.330 --> 02:53:57.230
and the head emerges from the shoulders

4327
02:53:57.230 --> 02:53:59.790
in the center in a very heavy hunch,

4328
02:53:59.790 --> 02:54:03.350
and even in that form, stands about 6 1/2 feet tall.

4329
02:54:03.350 --> 02:54:04.450
You imagine if she were able

4330
02:54:04.450 --> 02:54:07.030
to stand straight would be pushing probably 7 1/2 feet.

4331
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:08.970
LIAM: Great.
TRAVIS: I'll say her name again

4332
02:54:08.970 --> 02:54:11.300
and look very directly in her direction and say,

4333
02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:14.733
Isharnai, we've done much to seek an audience with you.

4334
02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:20.621
We hope we might be able to converse peacefully.

4335
02:54:20.621 --> 02:54:25.621
MATT: (sniffs) You can hear the loud sniffing sound

4336
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:30.240
and the warmth of breath on your cheek, Jester.

4337
02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:32.030
LAURA: She's right beside me.

4338
02:54:32.030 --> 02:54:36.057
MATT: Then takes a step back and another step back,

4339
02:54:36.057 --> 02:54:37.360
towards the house a bit,

4340
02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:40.370
getting between you and the house,

4341
02:54:40.370 --> 02:54:41.970
but still back towards the trees.

4342
02:54:41.970 --> 02:54:44.030
There's nobody behind her.

4343
02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:46.880
As the invisibility fades, and the rest of you begin

4344
02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:50.960
to now see the physical form of Isharnai there

4345
02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:55.840
in the fading light of the late afternoon.

4346
02:54:55.840 --> 02:54:58.340
"It is rare to have

4347
02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:03.340
"so many visitors (snarls),

4348
02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:08.417
"let alone all at once, at my home.

4349
02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:17.195
"You come here, survive the trial of the trek,

4350
02:55:18.470 --> 02:55:21.050
"and I assume it's because you're driven

4351
02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:24.940
"by the need for strong answers, yes?

4352
02:55:28.690 --> 02:55:31.110
"What is it that drives you then?

4353
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:36.110
"Come, come, we can talk,

4354
02:55:36.151 --> 02:55:38.209
"one at a time."

4355
02:55:38.209 --> 02:55:40.367
LAURA: One at a time?

4356
02:55:40.367 --> 02:55:42.017
TRAVIS: That's some stupid horseshit.

4357
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:46.090
MATT: Those of you who are inside the house,

4358
02:55:46.090 --> 02:55:47.068
as you're glancing through

4359
02:55:47.068 --> 02:55:50.560
and seeing the head (clicks) darts

4360
02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:52.130
in an unnatural speed in your direction,

4361
02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:53.580
and the arm emerges and goes.

4362
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:57.261
MATT: I just grab Nott by the hand.

4363
02:55:57.261 --> 02:55:59.844
SAM: (whimpers)

4364
02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:02.100
LAURA: Is Nott still invisible?

4365
02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:02.933
SAM: I am.

4366
02:56:04.983 --> 02:56:06.370
MATT: Do you leave the house?

4367
02:56:06.370 --> 02:56:07.203
MARISHA: I guess so.

4368
02:56:07.203 --> 02:56:09.121
TRAVIS: Do I see any shit running down Nott's legs?

4369
02:56:09.121 --> 02:56:10.030
(laughter)

4370
02:56:10.030 --> 02:56:11.220
MATT: Does he?
SAM: Invisible shit.

4371
02:56:11.220 --> 02:56:13.510
MARISHA: Just a little.
MATT: Ah, invisible shit (laughs).

4372
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:15.121
TRAVIS: I can see it.

4373
02:56:15.121 --> 02:56:16.590
SAM: Oh, he's still seeing invisibility.

4374
02:56:16.590 --> 02:56:17.433
MATT: Yeah.

4375
02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:20.598
(laughter)

4376
02:56:20.598 --> 02:56:23.682
SAM: Little, little bit, little trickle.

4377
02:56:23.682 --> 02:56:25.652
LIAM: The rest of us just see rabbit pellets appear.

4378
02:56:25.652 --> 02:56:27.468
(laughter)

4379
02:56:27.468 --> 02:56:29.490
MATT: (popping)

4380
02:56:29.490 --> 02:56:31.747
Yasha, do you walk with them?

4381
02:56:32.974 --> 02:56:34.690
Because you're at the threshold.

4382
02:56:34.690 --> 02:56:35.523
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4383
02:56:35.523 --> 02:56:36.970
MATT: Okay.

4384
02:56:36.970 --> 02:56:39.980
You watch as she makes these long lumbering strides

4385
02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:42.830
towards the house, the arms swaying unnaturally

4386
02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:44.300
from side to side.

4387
02:56:44.300 --> 02:56:47.520
As she reaches the base of the rock, there's a pause,

4388
02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:51.120
and then she skitters up the side like a spider,

4389
02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:53.240
before getting to the top.

4390
02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:54.810
ASHLEY: I don't like it, I don't like it.

4391
02:56:54.810 --> 02:56:56.110
LIAM: That's bad, you're bad.

4392
02:56:56.110 --> 02:56:59.390
MATT: She steps inside the house, leaving the door open.

4393
02:56:59.390 --> 02:57:03.290
You see her spin from the inside and rest,

4394
02:57:03.290 --> 02:57:06.940
sitting on what looks like a stool,

4395
02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:11.110
but you see her pull a large box, one of the crates

4396
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:13.360
that was empty on the side, as a chair,

4397
02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:15.550
scoots it up and sits on the opposite side of the table

4398
02:57:15.550 --> 02:57:18.080
and (squeaks) arranges it in front of her,

4399
02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:20.825
takes the lantern, sets it on a hook.

4400
02:57:20.825 --> 02:57:21.950
MARISHA: (groans)

4401
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:23.880
MATT: "Who wishes to talk?"

4402
02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:25.540
SAM: Ugh, gross.

4403
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:32.220
TRAVIS: Well, two of you are here for a reason,

4404
02:57:32.220 --> 02:57:34.200
and all of us can get our palms read.

4405
02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:37.200
Would you prefer if someone else went first?

4406
02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:38.033
MARISHA: Yes.

4407
02:57:38.890 --> 02:57:42.230
Yes, I don't know what to expect, yes.

4408
02:57:42.230 --> 02:57:43.807
Someone with lower stakes.

4409
02:57:43.807 --> 02:57:44.870
ASHLEY: By all means.

4410
02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:46.250
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll go.

4411
02:57:47.940 --> 02:57:50.480
Well, I mean, if somebody has to go.

4412
02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:51.521
I'll talk.

4413
02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:55.386
MATT: So you enter the house?

4414
02:57:55.386 --> 02:57:56.360
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Okay.

4415
02:57:57.210 --> 02:57:59.020
LIAM: Speed dating.
SAM: All by yourself?

4416
02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:02.390
MATT: You step into the room, and it's tight quarters

4417
02:58:02.390 --> 02:58:03.730
with the two of you in there.

4418
02:58:03.730 --> 02:58:05.020
You're about five feet

4419
02:58:05.020 --> 02:58:07.690
from her, comfortably.

4420
02:58:07.690 --> 02:58:09.240
As you step into the chamber,

4421
02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:13.080
the door (whooshes) closes behind you, on its own.

4422
02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:15.430
You guys lose all sight of Fjord.

4423
02:58:15.430 --> 02:58:16.660
The chamber is just closed,

4424
02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:18.560
and the interior light is not visible.

4425
02:58:20.328 --> 02:58:21.830
ASHLEY: We can't even look through the windows.

4426
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:22.663
MATT: There are no windows.

4427
02:58:22.663 --> 02:58:23.846
LAURA: We can't even hear anything?

4428
02:58:23.846 --> 02:58:25.672
MATT: And no door-- no, there is a door.

4429
02:58:25.672 --> 02:58:28.115
(laughter)

4430
02:58:28.115 --> 02:58:30.060
ASHLEY: I thought there were windows in the front.

4431
02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:33.890
MATT: The lantern marked ahead lights the room,

4432
02:58:33.890 --> 02:58:35.000
but the shadow's still cast

4433
02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.560
across the upper half of the face,

4434
02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:39.350
and you can see the piercing and a faint glow

4435
02:58:39.350 --> 02:58:41.660
of green eyes, from underneath,

4436
02:58:41.660 --> 02:58:42.780
looking right at you.

4437
02:58:42.780 --> 02:58:45.930
The arms spread out akimbo

4438
02:58:45.930 --> 02:58:48.260
and grasping the sides of her knees,

4439
02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:49.910
as she stares towards you.

4440
02:58:51.490 --> 02:58:52.623
"So?"

4441
02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:00.280
TRAVIS: Oh, you're waiting for me to speak.

4442
02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:03.930
MATT: "I assume you came with a reason."

4443
02:59:05.680 --> 02:59:06.720
TRAVIS: I did.

4444
02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:08.780
Forgive me, the words fall a bit short

4445
02:59:08.780 --> 02:59:12.700
when you're in the room of something as revered

4446
02:59:12.700 --> 02:59:14.340
and mysterious as yourself.

4447
02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:15.840
We've actually done quite

4448
02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:18.600
a bit of research.
MATT: "(laughs)

4449
02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:21.600
"Flattery, I like it."

4450
02:59:23.650 --> 02:59:24.792
TRAVIS: Happy to please.

4451
02:59:27.152 --> 02:59:30.037
I suppose my question would start with,

4452
02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:35.745
it seems one of our party

4453
02:59:35.745 --> 02:59:38.178
was affected by something

4454
02:59:38.178 --> 02:59:40.177
that you might have done with her.

4455
02:59:41.740 --> 02:59:45.170
It is of great interest to us if we might be able

4456
02:59:45.170 --> 02:59:50.170
to discuss a way to lift your...

4457
02:59:50.295 --> 02:59:51.611
effect.

4458
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:56.323
MATT: "I take it you mean the goblin among you."

4459
02:59:56.323 --> 02:59:57.989
SAM: I'm invisible. She can't see me.

4460
02:59:57.989 --> 03:00:00.476
TRAVIS: There is not much that escapes your view.

4461
03:00:00.476 --> 03:00:03.026
MATT: "Well,

4462
03:00:03.026 --> 03:00:07.284
"that was quite the favor I had

4463
03:00:07.284 --> 03:00:10.140
"repaid that day."

4464
03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:11.281
TRAVIS: Favor?

4465
03:00:12.569 --> 03:00:13.810
Repaid?

4466
03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:23.680
MATT: "I am a woman of my word.

4467
03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:25.988
"It takes a lot

4468
03:00:25.988 --> 03:00:29.371
"to ask me to break

4469
03:00:29.371 --> 03:00:32.330
"of my promises.

4470
03:00:32.330 --> 03:00:35.627
"I have a reputation to maintain."

4471
03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:39.620
TRAVIS: You've done a beautiful job.

4472
03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:45.350
Might I ask, you said a favor was repaid.

4473
03:00:45.350 --> 03:00:48.270
I can't imagine someone of your ilk is

4474
03:00:48.270 --> 03:00:51.088
in need of services very often.

4475
03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:54.480
MATT: "Not often, no.

4476
03:00:55.740 --> 03:01:00.381
"Circumstances can sometimes be...

4477
03:01:00.381 --> 03:01:02.480
"strange."

4478
03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:04.200
TRAVIS: I understand.

4479
03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:06.380
We happen to be a group of individuals

4480
03:01:06.380 --> 03:01:11.200
that often find ourselves in strange circumstances.

4481
03:01:12.090 --> 03:01:14.873
Perhaps we could be of use to you.

4482
03:01:19.447 --> 03:01:21.680
MATT: "Hmm."

4483
03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:23.195
Make a persuasion check.

4484
03:01:23.195 --> 03:01:24.224
MARISHA: Oh my god,

4485
03:01:24.224 --> 03:01:27.842
he asked her.

4486
03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:30.690
TRAVIS: With disadvantage, right?

4487
03:01:30.690 --> 03:01:32.291
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Ooh!

4488
03:01:32.291 --> 03:01:34.650
TRAVIS: That was a 22, and that's a 10.

4489
03:01:34.650 --> 03:01:36.240
MARISHA: Oh, it was so good.

4490
03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:37.073
MATT: A 10?

4491
03:01:37.073 --> 03:01:38.137
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4492
03:01:38.137 --> 03:01:39.779
LIAM: Dang it, Fjordy.

4493
03:01:41.979 --> 03:01:44.080
MATT: "No favors.

4494
03:01:47.370 --> 03:01:52.248
"I thrive on my connections.

4495
03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:58.438
"One could trade, perhaps."

4496
03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:02.316
TRAVIS: Trade?
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

4497
03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:08.042
TRAVIS: You seem to know all.

4498
03:02:08.042 --> 03:02:09.660
MATT: "(laughs)"
TRAVIS: Is there anything

4499
03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:12.005
that you have a particular interest in?

4500
03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:17.082
MATT: "I've seen many lifetimes.

4501
03:02:18.430 --> 03:02:22.220
"And I (cracks)," and you hear this heavy crack

4502
03:02:22.220 --> 03:02:24.727
as the neck snaps in an unnatural way.

4503
03:02:24.727 --> 03:02:27.028
LIAM: No.
MATT: "(exhales)"

4504
03:02:27.028 --> 03:02:27.861
SAM: Incorrect.

4505
03:02:27.861 --> 03:02:30.361
(laughter)

4506
03:02:35.690 --> 03:02:40.656
MATT: "I enjoy

4507
03:02:40.656 --> 03:02:45.639
"being tethered to misery.

4508
03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:49.850
"It feeds me.

4509
03:02:52.030 --> 03:02:57.030
"And your friend has been a

4510
03:02:57.138 --> 03:02:59.638
"delicious drip."

4511
03:03:06.744 --> 03:03:07.577
TRAVIS: Hmm.

4512
03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:09.990
I'm sure you can understand I don't want

4513
03:03:09.990 --> 03:03:13.450
to speak for any of the other members of our group,

4514
03:03:13.450 --> 03:03:18.450
but there may be more

4515
03:03:19.125 --> 03:03:22.358
misery amongst us.

4516
03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.975
MATT: "Existing misery is paltry.

4517
03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:32.524
"New misery--"

4518
03:03:32.524 --> 03:03:34.150
TRAVIS: Ah.

4519
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:37.047
MATT: "That is lasting."

4520
03:03:40.826 --> 03:03:41.659
SAM: Gross.

4521
03:03:41.659 --> 03:03:43.517
TRAVIS: I care very much for these people.

4522
03:03:46.220 --> 03:03:48.440
If I am not one to offer you what you would seek,

4523
03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:50.240
I'm sure there is someone in our group

4524
03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:55.240
that may be able to satisfy, but is there anything,

4525
03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:59.208
as you see through me, that interests you?

4526
03:04:01.530 --> 03:04:04.958
MATT: "For this transaction, perhaps not.

4527
03:04:04.958 --> 03:04:09.108
"But if you seek

4528
03:04:09.108 --> 03:04:12.341
"other enlightenment,

"I could turn that around a bit.

4533
03:04:31.622 --> 03:04:36.150
TRAVIS: You paint an alluring picture, but no.

4534
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:37.290
I thank you for your time.

4535
03:04:37.290 --> 03:04:38.640
And I turn, and I leave.

4536
03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:39.950
MATT: The door's already open for you.

4537
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:40.990
LIAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Wow.

4538
03:04:42.570 --> 03:04:45.988
TRAVIS: That was very good.

4539
03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:52.150
MATT: "(sniffing)"

4540
03:04:52.150 --> 03:04:53.425
No response beyond that.

4541
03:04:53.425 --> 03:04:54.659
TRAVIS: I walk out.

4542
03:04:54.659 --> 03:04:56.070
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: What happened?

4543
03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:57.428
Are you okay?

4544
03:04:58.895 --> 03:04:59.857
TRAVIS: (like Gollum) I'm afraid.

4545
03:04:59.857 --> 03:05:01.536
SAM: Oh shit!
LAURA: Oh no, no, no, Fjord!

4546
03:05:01.536 --> 03:05:02.490
TRAVIS: (coughing)

4547
03:05:02.490 --> 03:05:05.165
Fuck, the humidity change is so dramatic.

4548
03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:11.050
She's a deal-maker.

4549
03:05:11.050 --> 03:05:13.441
She's attracted by misery.

4550
03:05:13.441 --> 03:05:16.830
Not existing, but perhaps new.

4551
03:05:16.830 --> 03:05:19.280
It seems we'll have to give something in order to

4552
03:05:20.530 --> 03:05:22.178
have your curse lifted.
MARISHA: I walk in.

4553
03:05:22.178 --> 03:05:25.600
LAURA: Oh, come on!

4554
03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:29.160
Caleb, as soon as she comes out, Fire Bolt the hut.

4555
03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:31.460
MATT: You step in, and the door closes behind you.

4556
03:05:32.410 --> 03:05:33.410
TALIESIN: Okay.
LIAM: Why wait?

4557
03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:37.260
SAM: Oh, misery.

4558
03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:39.270
MARISHA: What's this about new misery?

4559
03:05:40.270 --> 03:05:41.577
What now?

4560
03:05:41.577 --> 03:05:44.810
MATT: "(sniffing)"

4561
03:05:44.810 --> 03:05:45.867
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

4562
03:05:45.867 --> 03:05:48.259
(laughter)

4563
03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:54.830
MATT: "You have a familiar scent on you.

4564
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:59.053
"I can sense we are already tethered in some way."

4565
03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:03.317
MARISHA: Tell me.
MATT: "A familiar taste."

4566
03:06:06.030 --> 03:06:07.040
MARISHA: Familiar?

4567
03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:10.457
So not new.

4568
03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:14.731
MATT: "Not new.

4569
03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:18.647
"But I can take new."

4570
03:06:20.010 --> 03:06:22.030
MARISHA: What more could you take from me

4571
03:06:22.030 --> 03:06:24.209
that you haven't already?

4572
03:06:24.209 --> 03:06:29.170
MATT: "(laughs) You have an imagination, don't you?

4573
03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:31.913
"Quite a lot."

4574
03:06:31.913 --> 03:06:34.580
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4575
03:06:37.063 --> 03:06:39.195
MATT: "What would you give me?"

4576
03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:45.643
MARISHA: Why don't you start by
telling me what you've taken?

4577
03:06:47.740 --> 03:06:48.806
MATT: "From you?"

4578
03:06:50.430 --> 03:06:51.833
MARISHA: From me and mine.

4579
03:06:54.740 --> 03:06:56.198
MATT: "I have given.

4580
03:06:58.470 --> 03:07:01.792
"I have granted what was asked of me."

4581
03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:05.553
MARISHA: Yeah.

4582
03:07:06.530 --> 03:07:08.720
MATT: "And yet you smell of misery.

4583
03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:16.320
"You ask a question you already know the answer to."

4584
03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:21.320
MARISHA: Nothing's given freely, ever.

4585
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:24.090
MATT: "(laughs)"

4586
03:07:27.410 --> 03:07:28.243
MARISHA: So,

4587
03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:35.650
if I already smell of misery, not new misery,

4588
03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:39.535
what more could you want?

4589
03:07:43.929 --> 03:07:45.490
MATT: "(sighs)"

4590
03:07:45.490 --> 03:07:50.490
She shifts her demeanor towards you,

4591
03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:51.956
thinking.

4592
03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:06.316
"It's not about specifically

4593
03:08:06.316 --> 03:08:07.624
"<i>taking.</i>

4594
03:08:09.790 --> 03:08:13.480
"What I want is to be given something

4595
03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:18.043
"that you know you would not want to lose."

4596
03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:24.177
MARISHA: And then what do I get?

4597
03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:27.550
MATT: "I release your friend.

4598
03:08:30.920 --> 03:08:35.918
"But the scales have to weigh evenly."

4599
03:08:45.953 --> 03:08:48.120
MARISHA: That I don't want to lose.

4600
03:09:04.059 --> 03:09:06.559
I'll walk away from all of it,

4601
03:09:09.890 --> 03:09:12.240
everything that I've worked really hard to get,

4602
03:09:14.320 --> 03:09:17.820
this fam-uly, fam, fam, family?

4603
03:09:17.820 --> 03:09:18.653
LIAM: It's in the air.

4604
03:09:18.653 --> 03:09:19.839
It's not your fault.

4605
03:09:19.839 --> 03:09:21.590
It's all of us.

4606
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:22.731
MARISHA: This family,

4607
03:09:27.140 --> 03:09:28.612
my old family,

4608
03:09:32.470 --> 03:09:33.686
my new brother,

4609
03:09:38.060 --> 03:09:39.651
my position.

4610
03:09:54.430 --> 03:09:58.020
MATT: She leans forward, interested,

4611
03:09:58.020 --> 03:09:59.703
and listening intently.

4612
03:10:03.220 --> 03:10:06.768
MARISHA: I've achieved more than I thought I ever would,

4613
03:10:11.730 --> 03:10:14.013
richer than I ever thought I would,

4614
03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:21.815
more skilled than I ever thought I would.

4615
03:10:25.982 --> 03:10:29.649
I don't know what's left, past this, anyway.

4616
03:10:39.370 --> 03:10:41.287
Maybe I've peaked, you know.

4617
03:10:46.508 --> 03:10:49.045
MATT: "Chosen exile."

4618
03:10:53.315 --> 03:10:55.430
You see her eyes seeming

4619
03:10:55.430 --> 03:10:59.120
to look beyond the walls of this chamber

4620
03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:02.172
towards the individuals that await you outside.

4621
03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.108
"From this?

4622
03:11:07.108 --> 03:11:12.008
"<i>That</i> is new misery."

4623
03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:18.030
MARISHA: Where would I be exiled to?

4624
03:11:18.030 --> 03:11:21.863
My choice, yeah, but where would I be?

4625
03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:25.637
MATT: "The inspiration will find you."

4626
03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:33.475
Do you accept this transaction?

4627
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:46.135
MARISHA: And what of my family,

4628
03:11:46.135 --> 03:11:49.690
my blood family?

4629
03:11:49.690 --> 03:11:53.010
What of my father and his current deal?

4630
03:11:53.010 --> 03:11:57.068
MATT: "His deal continues until it

4631
03:11:57.068 --> 03:12:00.543
"comes to its fruition.

4632
03:12:00.543 --> 03:12:03.730
"This is a new deal for a new misery.

4633
03:12:07.740 --> 03:12:10.123
"Think about it if you're uncertain.

4634
03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:16.315
"But you've come this far, have you not?

4635
03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:22.535
"Be a shame to walk away empty-handed."

4636
03:12:30.328 --> 03:12:31.769
MARISHA: I leave.

4637
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:36.030
MATT: Beauregard exits.

4638
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.910
SAM: What'd you say, what'd you do?

4639
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:38.040
What happened?
LAURA: What just happened?

4640
03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:39.120
MARISHA: Go talk to her.

4641
03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:40.043
SAM: Me?

4642
03:12:40.043 --> 03:12:40.876
MARISHA: Yeah.

4643
03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:43.480
LAURA: Beau, what did you do?

4644
03:12:43.480 --> 03:12:45.660
TRAVIS: She knows you're here, Nott.

4645
03:12:45.660 --> 03:12:46.980
SAM: I'm invisible.
LAURA: What did you do?

4646
03:12:46.980 --> 03:12:49.250
MARISHA: I didn't do anything.
TRAVIS: No, she knows.

4647
03:12:49.250 --> 03:12:50.083
MARISHA: Not yet.

4648
03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:57.749
SAM: All right, I'll go in.

4649
03:12:57.749 --> 03:12:59.648
LAURA: (sighs)

4650
03:12:59.648 --> 03:13:00.798
MATT: Okay.

4651
03:13:02.740 --> 03:13:04.670
You muster the courage.

4652
03:13:06.050 --> 03:13:08.150
SAM: I take a little more sip.
MATT: Okay.

4653
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:09.950
It's been quite a while since you drank.

4654
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:12.050
So you're not drunk anymore.

4655
03:13:12.050 --> 03:13:13.750
You're on the cusp of a mild headache.

4656
03:13:13.750 --> 03:13:14.908
TRAVIS: Damn tolerance.

4657
03:13:16.890 --> 03:13:20.230
MATT: But you enter the chamber, and it closes behind you.

4658
03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:25.888
The woman is currently

4659
03:13:25.888 --> 03:13:27.163
looming over the table,

4660
03:13:27.163 --> 03:13:30.920
looking towards you and is just filling most of your vision,

4661
03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:34.648
at that point, before she sits into a resting position.

4662
03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:38.590
Leans in on the table, looking down at you,

4663
03:13:38.590 --> 03:13:41.130
arms crossing, and you see, once again,

4664
03:13:41.130 --> 03:13:44.957
like the dual joints bending before folding.

4665
03:13:46.190 --> 03:13:50.540
"It's been some time, halfling girl."

4666
03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:52.023
SAM: So you remember me?

4667
03:13:52.890 --> 03:13:55.482
MATT: I remember everything.

4668
03:13:57.010 --> 03:13:59.218
SAM: Have you done this to other people?

4669
03:14:02.650 --> 03:14:04.583
MATT: "Not quite this way,

4670
03:14:04.583 --> 03:14:07.580
"but you're not the first punishment

4671
03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:10.060
"I've been asked to enforce."

4672
03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:16.380
SAM: Might I ask why?

4673
03:14:18.555 --> 03:14:22.871
You said a debt, but

4674
03:14:22.871 --> 03:14:25.346
what debt?

4675
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:31.255
MATT: "Let's just say those goblins

4676
03:14:31.255 --> 03:14:36.246
"once did me quite the favor

4677
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:40.913
"with something I couldn't achieve myself."

4678
03:14:42.007 --> 03:14:43.580
SAM: And they did this favor for you

4679
03:14:43.580 --> 03:14:47.610
in exchange for a repayment?

4680
03:14:47.610 --> 03:14:49.662
MATT: "For a favor to them.

4681
03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:55.705
"Then one day they came and called that debt in.

4682
03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:01.840
"I felt it was maybe a bit small-minded,

4683
03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:05.670
"but I respect those in the throes

4684
03:15:05.670 --> 03:15:09.630
"of anger and vengeful fury.

4685
03:15:10.570 --> 03:15:12.612
"That's a powerful thing."

4686
03:15:15.550 --> 03:15:20.430
SAM: Just hypothetically, if they didn't exist anymore,

4687
03:15:20.430 --> 03:15:24.790
would that debt need be honored?

4688
03:15:24.790 --> 03:15:29.708
MATT: "Oh (laughs), my word is my bind.

4689
03:15:30.620 --> 03:15:32.330
"Whether or not they're around,

4690
03:15:32.330 --> 03:15:37.330
"I cannot just discard my promises,

4691
03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:41.277
"reputation and all that."

4692
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:49.020
SAM: And to undo it, you would need some sort

4693
03:15:49.020 --> 03:15:51.247
of payment from me?

4694
03:15:52.850 --> 03:15:56.775
MATT: "Or a equal misery in turn."

4695
03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:01.345
SAM: What if--

4696
03:16:03.578 --> 03:16:07.650
does the misery have to affect me or my friends?

4697
03:16:07.650 --> 03:16:08.742
Can it be anyone?

4698
03:16:09.880 --> 03:16:12.058
MATT: "It can be a misery offered,

4699
03:16:13.140 --> 03:16:16.940
"but it has to be

4700
03:16:16.940 --> 03:16:18.598
"given freely.

4701
03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:23.820
"It's hard to take something like that.

4702
03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:28.772
"The willingness is what makes it so ripe!"

4703
03:16:30.526 --> 03:16:31.918
SAM: The willingness.

4704
03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:38.123
So another life, another body, something like that?

4705
03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:42.633
What about...

4706
03:16:46.130 --> 03:16:47.813
We've got two options here.

4707
03:16:49.335 --> 03:16:51.485
How about the life of a weasel?

4708
03:16:51.485 --> 03:16:54.968
(laughter)

4709
03:16:56.410 --> 03:16:57.835
Not big enough, right?

4710
03:16:58.810 --> 03:17:01.320
MATT: "You're amusing, little one."

4711
03:17:01.320 --> 03:17:03.428
SAM: I've been drinking a lot, today.

4712
03:17:06.230 --> 03:17:07.530
I'm not promising anything,

4713
03:17:07.530 --> 03:17:12.530
but what if two warring nations were about

4714
03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:14.440
to form a lasting peace,

4715
03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:17.758
and that peace just sort of went away?

4716
03:17:18.839 --> 03:17:22.140
TALIESIN: (gasps)
LIAM: Sick, fucking sick.

4717
03:17:23.700 --> 03:17:25.978
SAM: That would cause misery for thousands,

4718
03:17:26.940 --> 03:17:28.845
tens of thousands of people.

4719
03:17:29.740 --> 03:17:33.838
MATT: "Ah, but I am not tethered to that misery,

4720
03:17:36.500 --> 03:17:39.647
"unless you tether it for me."

4721
03:17:42.030 --> 03:17:44.450
The eyes are growing brighter.

4722
03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:46.000
SAM: How does that work?

4723
03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:50.010
MATT: Without looking, the hand reaches over

4724
03:17:50.010 --> 03:17:52.760
and extends all the way to the shelf

4725
03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:56.190
from her sitting position on the opposite end of the room,

4726
03:17:56.190 --> 03:17:59.140
and between the fingers, you can see grasping

4727
03:17:59.140 --> 03:18:01.830
four different jars and vials

4728
03:18:01.830 --> 03:18:03.080
and pulling them over.

4729
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:05.838
"I have ways,

4730
03:18:08.140 --> 03:18:11.906
"tinctures that can

4731
03:18:11.906 --> 03:18:14.198
"bear the connection."

4732
03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:22.300
SAM: That I would have to take, swallow, apply?

4733
03:18:22.300 --> 03:18:24.883
MATT: "Apply, have them

4734
03:18:24.883 --> 03:18:27.716
"swallow themselves

4735
03:18:27.716 --> 03:18:29.124
"of me."

4736
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:35.970
SAM: Swallow.

4737
03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:45.635
I won't be able to do it today, obviously.

4738
03:18:46.580 --> 03:18:48.515
MATT: "But if you do this,

4739
03:18:49.940 --> 03:18:53.773
"then I will remove, happily, this

4740
03:18:53.773 --> 03:18:57.989
"hex I hold on your soul."

4741
03:18:59.090 --> 03:19:01.808
SAM: And I'll go back to being the way I was?

4742
03:19:03.940 --> 03:19:05.842
MATT: "With the right magic, yes.

4743
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:09.910
"I could help with that,

4744
03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:12.752
"though the process is a bit, uh (laughs),

4745
03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:16.230
"painful, if familiar."

4746
03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:18.220
SAM: Yes.

4747
03:19:23.464 --> 03:19:25.300
Oh, what does that do?

4748
03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:27.710
It just connects you to that person's soul?

4749
03:19:30.870 --> 03:19:33.325
MATT: "It's difficult to explain,

4750
03:19:34.890 --> 03:19:38.533
"but sure, close enough."

4751
03:19:43.502 --> 03:19:45.480
SAM: Do I have to leave a deposit or something,

4752
03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:46.980
or can I just take one?

4753
03:19:48.390 --> 03:19:50.840
MATT: "Well, do you agree to my transaction?"

4754
03:19:51.930 --> 03:19:55.013
SAM: I don't know if it's possible even.

4755
03:19:57.114 --> 03:19:57.947
Ah.

4756
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:01.623
Oh boy.

4757
03:20:04.600 --> 03:20:06.220
I better go talk to my friends.

4758
03:20:07.543 --> 03:20:10.050
MATT: (clinks) The glasses clink together

4759
03:20:10.050 --> 03:20:11.910
as she places them not back on the shelf

4760
03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:16.910
but to the floor, beside, in a holding position.

4761
03:20:17.240 --> 03:20:19.640
The other hand gives a gesture

4762
03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:22.140
as the door (whooshes) opens behind you.

4763
03:20:24.679 --> 03:20:27.262
SAM: I'll just sort of back out of the room.

4764
03:20:30.540 --> 03:20:33.250
Just one more question, before I go.

4765
03:20:33.250 --> 03:20:34.575
MATT: "Yes?"

4766
03:20:38.250 --> 03:20:40.292
SAM: Did you enjoy doing this to me?

4767
03:20:42.634 --> 03:20:44.757
MATT: "Didn't enjoy doing it to you.

4768
03:20:46.690 --> 03:20:48.482
"I've enjoyed everything since."

4769
03:20:55.240 --> 03:20:56.848
SAM: All right, I'll leave.

4770
03:21:01.590 --> 03:21:03.432
Not much happened in there.

4771
03:21:07.292 --> 03:21:08.530
I don't want to kill her,

4772
03:21:08.530 --> 03:21:11.767
but I feel like that's going to be super hard.

4773
03:21:13.430 --> 03:21:16.000
TRAVIS: I actually agree with you,

4774
03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:18.880
only because I can't imagine any of us would be able

4775
03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:21.420
to give anything that wouldn't shift our lives

4776
03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:23.110
or the lives of those around us

4777
03:21:23.110 --> 03:21:25.530
without getting what we want.

4778
03:21:25.530 --> 03:21:26.730
MARISHA: What did she tell you?

4779
03:21:30.900 --> 03:21:32.730
SAM: She told me that she could help.

4780
03:21:32.730 --> 03:21:34.110
LAURA: How?

4781
03:21:34.110 --> 03:21:35.851
Why? What did you offer?

4782
03:21:38.890 --> 03:21:41.140
SAM: Things that don't really affect us, though.

4783
03:21:42.740 --> 03:21:44.720
ASHLEY: Like what?

4784
03:21:44.720 --> 03:21:46.560
SAM: Just other people.

4785
03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:49.090
LAURA: Other people? You offered to torture other people?

4786
03:21:49.090 --> 03:21:51.020
SAM: I didn't offer to torture anyone.

4787
03:21:51.020 --> 03:21:55.380
I just, I would make sure that none of us were harmed

4788
03:21:55.380 --> 03:21:57.500
or sacrificed in any way.

4789
03:21:58.480 --> 03:21:59.820
LAURA: That's all dark, Nott.

4790
03:21:59.820 --> 03:22:01.170
I don't know what you're talking about.

4791
03:22:01.170 --> 03:22:05.040
SAM: Well, I mean, there's a lot of evil people out there,

4792
03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:07.810
these people who have been waging war against each other,

4793
03:22:07.810 --> 03:22:10.170
and they're not innocent.

4794
03:22:13.150 --> 03:22:17.010
They've been doing this to each other now for years,

4795
03:22:17.010 --> 03:22:19.570
and they could've stopped at any time.

4796
03:22:19.570 --> 03:22:22.388
LIAM: And you singled out specific people?

4797
03:22:25.030 --> 03:22:26.230
SAM: No, I mean--

4798
03:22:26.230 --> 03:22:28.790
LIAM: Are we talking about the Assembly or--

4799
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:30.240
MARISHA: What did you offer?

4800
03:22:30.240 --> 03:22:32.140
SAM: I didn't, I mean, I didn't make any deals.

4801
03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:33.870
I just said that--

4802
03:22:33.870 --> 03:22:36.750
MARISHA: I already had a conversation with her.

4803
03:22:36.750 --> 03:22:37.583
SAM: Okay.

4804
03:22:37.583 --> 03:22:39.100
LIAM and SAM: What did you offer?

4805
03:22:42.420 --> 03:22:43.850
MARISHA: I just know whatever she wants,

4806
03:22:43.850 --> 03:22:46.240
it's got to be substantial.

4807
03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:50.128
So what did you offer?

4808
03:22:57.440 --> 03:23:02.440
SAM: To, to, to maybe, maybe tether her

4809
03:23:02.590 --> 03:23:06.320
to one of the souls of (sighs),

4810
03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:09.783
you know, Emperor Dwendal, maybe.

4811
03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:12.473
LAURA: How?

4812
03:23:14.040 --> 03:23:16.410
SAM: You have to take a, take a pill?

4813
03:23:16.410 --> 03:23:17.243
I mean, he's--

4814
03:23:17.243 --> 03:23:18.750
LAURA: That doesn't sound very doable.

4815
03:23:22.060 --> 03:23:23.235
SAM: Well, I mean,

4816
03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:27.360
we can do a lot of things.

4817
03:23:28.440 --> 03:23:29.773
LAURA: Like kill this lady?

4818
03:23:31.013 --> 03:23:33.660
SAM: I think it's easier to get Dwendal to swallow a pill

4819
03:23:33.660 --> 03:23:36.290
than it is to kill this lady.

4820
03:23:37.950 --> 03:23:41.480
LIAM: Dwendal is surrounded by hundreds of loyal subjects.

4821
03:23:41.480 --> 03:23:44.044
SAM: Yes, but we'll be right next to him.

4822
03:23:44.044 --> 03:23:45.340
LAURA: No, we won't.
LIAM: We're right next to her.

4823
03:23:47.890 --> 03:23:51.640
TRAVIS: Plus, it's most certainly
not as cut-and-dry as that.

4824
03:23:51.640 --> 03:23:54.610
There's always ripples.

4825
03:23:54.610 --> 03:23:55.443
MARISHA: Exactly.

4826
03:23:57.170 --> 03:24:01.160
ASHLEY: Wait, so she wants a sacrifice?

4827
03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:02.290
I don't understand.

4828
03:24:02.290 --> 03:24:04.480
TRAVIS: She said she wanted the scales to be even,

4829
03:24:04.480 --> 03:24:08.060
so for the gesture, for lifting the curse from Nott,

4830
03:24:08.060 --> 03:24:12.760
whatever the exchange is has to be equally monumental,

4831
03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:17.760
devastating, with misery attached to it.

4832
03:24:23.970 --> 03:24:26.597
TALIESIN: What was it worth to turn you into this?

4833
03:24:28.230 --> 03:24:29.670
What did they pay?

4834
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:31.800
SAM: For her?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4835
03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:32.633
SAM: It's a favor.

4836
03:24:32.633 --> 03:24:35.933
It's a debt to these goblins,

4837
03:24:35.933 --> 03:24:38.210
to my old clan.

4838
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:40.430
TRAVIS: I offered to make our services available,

4839
03:24:40.430 --> 03:24:42.040
and she declined.

4840
03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:43.400
SAM: I offered to kill the goblins,

4841
03:24:43.400 --> 03:24:45.190
and she said that wouldn't be enough.

4842
03:24:45.190 --> 03:24:46.998
What did you offer, Beau?

4843
03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:55.190
MARISHA: She wants new misery, right?

4844
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:56.320
SAM: Mm-hmm.

4845
03:24:56.320 --> 03:24:57.740
LAURA: What if I just go in and, like, offered

4846
03:24:57.740 --> 03:24:59.350
to, like, cut off my hand or something?

4847
03:24:59.350 --> 03:25:00.720
You think that's enough?

4848
03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:01.553
TALIESIN: No.

4849
03:25:01.553 --> 03:25:02.810
LAURA: But I really like my hand.

4850
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:05.540
TALIESIN: Both.

4851
03:25:05.540 --> 03:25:06.890
LAURA: Both my hands?

4852
03:25:06.890 --> 03:25:08.770
TALIESIN: And probably several other people's.

4853
03:25:08.770 --> 03:25:10.820
LIAM: You have to no longer be able to paint.

4854
03:25:12.530 --> 03:25:14.463
SAM: What did you offer, Beau?

4855
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:24.980
I offered war.

4856
03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:41.770
MARISHA: I think TJ,

4857
03:25:44.010 --> 03:25:45.702
my little brother,

4858
03:25:48.220 --> 03:25:52.650
and Luc could be best friends.

4859
03:25:56.780 --> 03:25:59.055
LAURA: Did you offer to kill them?

4860
03:25:59.055 --> 03:26:00.913
MARISHA: (laughs) No.

4861
03:26:00.913 --> 03:26:02.033
LAURA: Oh.

4862
03:26:02.033 --> 03:26:02.983
SAM: What do you mean?

4863
03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:15.153
MARISHA: I'm going to be a loner.

4864
03:26:19.850 --> 03:26:21.900
I'm used to it.

4865
03:26:21.900 --> 03:26:23.442
I'm comfortable there.

4866
03:26:25.875 --> 03:26:27.335
SAM: What does that mean?

4867
03:26:30.869 --> 03:26:33.182
You'd be isolated or something?

4868
03:26:36.170 --> 03:26:38.187
MARISHA: The things we've done together,

4869
03:26:44.647 --> 03:26:46.730
I'm never going to top that.

4870
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:51.390
And you're right.

4871
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:58.420
We have to fix you, because you have a son.

4872
03:27:00.860 --> 03:27:02.410
You have a little boy to raise.

4873
03:27:06.270 --> 03:27:10.390
And all of us are eventually going to find our own way.

4874
03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:17.620
It's not going to last forever.

4875
03:27:19.210 --> 03:27:20.690
And, you know, maybe,

4876
03:27:26.970 --> 03:27:31.357
maybe this was what it was all leading to,

4877
03:27:34.010 --> 03:27:36.700
Molly's lessons, that you taught me,

4878
03:27:36.700 --> 03:27:41.350
and this weird connection between me and you

4879
03:27:41.350 --> 03:27:43.570
and this fucking hag and--

4880
03:27:43.570 --> 03:27:44.630
LAURA: What are you talking about?

4881
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:46.300
Are you saying you're going to kill yourself?

4882
03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:47.520
Are you saying, what are you saying?

4883
03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:48.353
MARISHA: No, no.

4884
03:27:51.460 --> 03:27:53.310
ASHLEY: She's saying she'll leave all this.

4885
03:27:54.480 --> 03:27:55.830
LAURA: You're going to leave us?

4886
03:27:59.890 --> 03:28:02.540
MARISHA: Y'all are the greatest family I could ever ask for.

4887
03:28:05.415 --> 03:28:07.470
I can't, I can't top this, you know.

4888
03:28:07.470 --> 03:28:10.948
LAURA: Then don't offer that, don't offer that at all.

4889
03:28:13.610 --> 03:28:17.950
MARISHA: But, but (laughs), think about it.

4890
03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:22.600
SAM: No, she's right, I mean--
ASHLEY: I walk in.

4891
03:28:22.600 --> 03:28:24.060
SAM: It's, its, oh!

4892
03:28:24.060 --> 03:28:25.980
MATT: Okay, the door closes behind you.

4893
03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:26.813
TALIESIN: Damn it.

4894
03:28:32.850 --> 03:28:36.233
ASHLEY: You were saying you want
misery, and I have it in spades.

4895
03:28:38.920 --> 03:28:40.170
What are you looking for?

4896
03:28:52.930 --> 03:28:56.210
MATT: "You walk with heavy scars already.

4897
03:28:59.440 --> 03:29:03.415
"I don't know if you could offer me a fair trade.

4898
03:29:04.871 --> 03:29:08.640
"It's hard to feed from those

4899
03:29:08.640 --> 03:29:11.590
"who already wallow at the bottom.

4900
03:29:16.990 --> 03:29:20.228
"But I can turn that around for you, if you'd like."

4901
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.823
ASHLEY: How?

4902
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:34.440
MATT: "Well, what is it you dream of?

4903
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:38.610
"What is it that eludes your grasp?

4904
03:29:38.610 --> 03:29:41.718
"What is something

4905
03:29:41.718 --> 03:29:44.084
"that you wish for

4906
03:29:44.084 --> 03:29:46.980
"on the night's cloudy sky?"

4907
03:30:04.416 --> 03:30:09.060
ASHLEY: I don't know if you could give me what I want.

4908
03:30:09.060 --> 03:30:10.670
MATT: "Perhaps I can't.

4909
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:13.528
"I can do many things,

4910
03:30:13.528 --> 03:30:17.178
"but I have even my limitations."

4911
03:30:22.270 --> 03:30:24.180
ASHLEY: Can you bring people back from the dead?

4912
03:30:26.956 --> 03:30:28.723
MATT: "Hmm.

4913
03:30:33.280 --> 03:30:35.271
"It is difficult,

4914
03:30:35.271 --> 03:30:38.587
"but not impossible."

4915
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:02.400
ASHLEY: So if you did it,

4916
03:31:02.400 --> 03:31:04.793
if you could bring this person back...

4917
03:31:04.793 --> 03:31:07.210
MATT: (sighs)

4918
03:31:11.591 --> 03:31:13.260
ASHLEY: (sighs) No, I...

4919
03:31:17.480 --> 03:31:19.330
We're here for one thing.

4920
03:31:20.960 --> 03:31:22.510
I don't need anything from you.

4921
03:31:27.080 --> 03:31:28.290
But I could give you something

4922
03:31:28.290 --> 03:31:31.330
that would cause me a lot of misery to give you.

4923
03:31:33.690 --> 03:31:35.098
MATT: "Yes?"

4924
03:31:43.880 --> 03:31:46.888
ASHLEY: I take out

4925
03:31:46.888 --> 03:31:49.163
my book from Molly.

4926
03:31:53.250 --> 03:31:56.070
I have been collecting things

4927
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:58.267
for someone to bring to them.

4928
03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:07.240
These were for my wife.

4929
03:32:11.090 --> 03:32:15.140
And I pull out a flower from Molly.

4930
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:21.450
I don't want to give these things away, but I can.

4931
03:32:31.300 --> 03:32:33.667
MATT: Roll a persuasion check with disadvantage.

4932
03:32:36.080 --> 03:32:40.155
ASHLEY: My persuasion's already pretty low.

4933
03:32:40.155 --> 03:32:41.672
That's cocked.

4934
03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:46.553
Okay.

4935
03:32:46.553 --> 03:32:48.460
LAURA: (laughs)

4936
03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:49.293
ASHLEY: I rolled a one.

4937
03:32:52.030 --> 03:32:53.680
SAM: It's a nice book.

4938
03:32:53.680 --> 03:32:55.020
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4939
03:32:55.020 --> 03:32:59.753
MATT: "A good thought, but (hisses)

4940
03:32:59.753 --> 03:33:02.261
"not equal.

4941
03:33:08.480 --> 03:33:13.450
"Not all journeys come to a resolution."

4942
03:33:17.930 --> 03:33:19.380
ASHLEY: I know one resolution.

4943
03:33:21.460 --> 03:33:24.455
But I don't think it would end very well for you.

4944
03:33:24.455 --> 03:33:27.038
LAURA: (laughs)

4945
03:33:28.980 --> 03:33:32.990
MATT: You watch as the shoulders pull back a bit,

4946
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:37.840
and you swear, you swear for an instant, her body seems

4947
03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:40.930
to swell and grow as the shadows grow

4948
03:33:40.930 --> 03:33:42.370
across the walls behind her,

4949
03:33:42.370 --> 03:33:44.550
as she sits a little higher in the seat.

4950
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:48.497
"Do tell."

4951
03:33:51.150 --> 03:33:53.225
ASHLEY: Oh, I just meant I would kill you.

4952
03:33:54.376 --> 03:33:55.390
MATT: "(cackling)"
ASHLEY: Then maybe all

4953
03:33:55.390 --> 03:33:56.750
of this would be resolved.

4954
03:33:59.630 --> 03:34:01.290
MATT: You guys can hear the laughter emitting

4955
03:34:01.290 --> 03:34:02.660
from the inside of the house.
LAURA: Oh no.

4956
03:34:02.660 --> 03:34:03.872
TALIESIN: I don't like that.

4957
03:34:03.872 --> 03:34:08.090
ASHLEY: But I feel like, um,

4958
03:34:10.660 --> 03:34:13.380
I don't know, maybe you should hear

4959
03:34:13.380 --> 03:34:15.980
what everyone else has to offer,

4960
03:34:15.980 --> 03:34:17.730
before we get to that place.

4961
03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:25.955
MATT: "Smart of you, child of the wastes.

4962
03:34:27.263 --> 03:34:29.895
"(hisses)" The door (whooshes) opens up.

4963
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:33.437
ASHLEY: She's all yours, whoever wants to go in there.

4964
03:34:33.437 --> 03:34:34.885
LAURA: I go in.
SAM: (gasps)

4965
03:34:34.885 --> 03:34:36.340
TALIESIN: Fuck!
MATT: (laughs)

4966
03:34:36.340 --> 03:34:38.060
One by one, okay!

4967
03:34:40.510 --> 03:34:42.357
SAM: Oh Jester!
TRAVIS: Let's just fuck it up.

4968
03:34:42.357 --> 03:34:45.947
LAURA: Hi!

4969
03:34:45.947 --> 03:34:47.460
MATT: "Hmm.

4970
03:34:47.460 --> 03:34:50.420
"You're the one that found me."

4971
03:34:50.420 --> 03:34:51.630
LAURA: I did, I did.

4972
03:34:51.630 --> 03:34:53.842
I'm really sorry about it.

4973
03:34:56.220 --> 03:34:58.910
You know, we just really needed to see, like,

4974
03:34:58.910 --> 03:35:00.450
who you were going to come to see,

4975
03:35:00.450 --> 03:35:02.580
and I didn't know it would bother you.

4976
03:35:02.580 --> 03:35:04.230
You know, I didn't even think about the fact

4977
03:35:04.230 --> 03:35:07.550
that it's like, you know, in the future,

4978
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:09.420
if you ever want to scry on us,

4979
03:35:09.420 --> 03:35:11.480
I wouldn't blame you, you know,

4980
03:35:11.480 --> 03:35:13.900
because I did it to you before.

4981
03:35:13.900 --> 03:35:16.213
TRAVIS: Can that witch die from anti-misery?

4982
03:35:16.213 --> 03:35:19.612
LAURA: You come, take some.

4983
03:35:22.470 --> 03:35:23.977
MATT: "Right."

4984
03:35:23.977 --> 03:35:24.810
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

4985
03:35:26.410 --> 03:35:28.330
MATT: "What is it you seek?"

4986
03:35:28.330 --> 03:35:30.160
LAURA: Oh, I'm just looking for a way to break

4987
03:35:30.160 --> 03:35:32.770
that curse that, you know, you gave to my friend.

4988
03:35:32.770 --> 03:35:34.370
I don't want her to be a goblin anymore,

4989
03:35:34.370 --> 03:35:37.029
because she doesn't want to be a goblin, so--

4990
03:35:37.029 --> 03:35:38.417
MATT: "Right."
LAURA: Yeah.

4991
03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:43.780
MATT: "Well, have you an offering for trade?"

4992
03:35:43.780 --> 03:35:46.400
LAURA: Oh, something that would make me so miserable.

4993
03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:49.050
Right, that's what you want?

4994
03:35:49.050 --> 03:35:49.883
MATT: "Yes."

4995
03:35:52.310 --> 03:35:53.533
LAURA: Let's see.

4996
03:35:57.581 --> 03:35:59.685
I'm a pretty happy person.

4997
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:02.880
MATT: "I can see that."

4998
03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:09.630
LAURA: And I said I could offer, like, to give you a hand,

4999
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:12.488
like literally, if I cut my hand off or something.

5000
03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:16.826
MATT: "Or something."

5001
03:36:20.170 --> 03:36:22.290
LAURA: Um...

5002
03:36:22.290 --> 03:36:24.010
MATT: "Those are artistic hands."

5003
03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:28.748
LAURA: Yeah, I paint, I draw.

5004
03:36:28.748 --> 03:36:31.960
MATT: The mouth curls into a wide grin
LAURA: I also play piano.

5005
03:36:31.960 --> 03:36:34.702
Do you want me to play something for you?

5006
03:36:36.307 --> 03:36:39.550
MATT: "I'm fine, but thank you."

5007
03:36:39.550 --> 03:36:40.840
LAURA: You know, I bet you don't get a lot

5008
03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:42.720
of entertainment out here, right?

5009
03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:46.920
What if, in exchange, we, like, play you a concert?

5010
03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:49.130
I could paint your portrait.

5011
03:36:49.130 --> 03:36:51.050
You don't have any mirrors, you know.

5012
03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:52.850
I could show you what you look like.

5013
03:36:56.410 --> 03:36:58.160
MATT: "Back to what you said before.

5014
03:37:00.954 --> 03:37:05.547
"Are you offering your artistic expression?"

5015
03:37:08.250 --> 03:37:11.547
LAURA: Um, like, my, like,

5016
03:37:11.547 --> 03:37:14.822
ability to draw?

5017
03:37:16.300 --> 03:37:20.368
MATT: "It is something I see brings you much joy."

5018
03:37:22.590 --> 03:37:26.710
LAURA: Um, it does, it does, it really does.

5019
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:34.540
MATT: You see saliva gathering at the edges of her mouth,

5020
03:37:34.540 --> 03:37:38.643
one single string (slurps) on the table.

5021
03:37:43.310 --> 03:37:46.560
"If you give me your hands--"

5022
03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:49.570
LAURA: Like, literally, like, my hands.

5023
03:37:49.570 --> 03:37:51.880
Like, how will I eat, you know?

5024
03:37:51.880 --> 03:37:55.887
Like, what if it's just, you know, my ability to draw?

5025
03:37:57.090 --> 03:38:00.873
MATT: "You have friends who can feed you, right?"

5026
03:38:02.730 --> 03:38:06.010
LAURA: Oh man, that's going to suck real bad,

5027
03:38:06.010 --> 03:38:09.080
to not have any hands at all.

5028
03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:12.814
Does it negate it if I go and I grow them back or something?

5029
03:38:12.814 --> 03:38:15.314
MATT: "(laughs)

5030
03:38:16.850 --> 03:38:20.500
"I think you know how...

5031
03:38:22.850 --> 03:38:24.950
"intense

5032
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:28.860
"and lasting these bargains can be."

5033
03:38:28.860 --> 03:38:32.027
LAURA: Oh, right, I wouldn't be able to grow them back.

5034
03:38:33.310 --> 03:38:36.410
(blows raspberry)

5035
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:39.460
Both of my hands (laughs),

5036
03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:43.515
that just seems so stupid, oh.

5037
03:38:44.647 --> 03:38:45.580
(laughs)

5038
03:38:45.580 --> 03:38:48.060
MATT: She flicks a finger, and
you see one of the empty cages

5039
03:38:48.060 --> 03:38:49.560
in the wall (squeaks),

5040
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:52.716
about the right size for two hands.

5041
03:38:52.716 --> 03:38:55.299
LAURA: (laughs)

5042
03:38:58.427 --> 03:39:02.490
That's going to make things so difficult!

5043
03:39:02.490 --> 03:39:03.980
No hands?

5044
03:39:03.980 --> 03:39:05.080
(laughter)

5045
03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:08.140
SAM: You're the one who offered it.

5046
03:39:11.470 --> 03:39:13.678
MATT: "Individuals make do all the time.

5047
03:39:13.678 --> 03:39:15.650
LAURA: Wait, wait, what about when I cast spells,

5048
03:39:15.650 --> 03:39:16.880
like with my fingers?

5049
03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:21.658
Is it like Doctor Strange, where, like, I can still do it?

5050
03:39:21.658 --> 03:39:24.158
(laughter)

5051
03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:28.770
MATT: "That would be a conversation between you

5052
03:39:28.770 --> 03:39:31.040
"and whatever entity--"

5053
03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:32.090
LAURA: His name's the Traveler.

5054
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:33.260
He's a really powerful god.

5055
03:39:33.260 --> 03:39:35.918
I bet he's here, right now, looking over me.

5056
03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:40.523
Are you here?
MATT: "Right.

5057
03:39:40.523 --> 03:39:42.030
"Have we a deal?"

5058
03:39:42.030 --> 03:39:46.170
As she leans forward, seeming to consume the interior

5059
03:39:46.170 --> 03:39:51.170
of the chamber, looming over and down upon you,

5060
03:39:52.460 --> 03:39:57.160
the one lengthy hand reaching out, like this.

5061
03:39:58.910 --> 03:40:02.940
LAURA: Well, hold on, maybe before we make the deal,

5062
03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:07.650
I can eat one last cupcake, you know,

5063
03:40:07.650 --> 03:40:09.732
since I won't be able to do it.

5064
03:40:16.290 --> 03:40:18.720
Okay (sobs).

5065
03:40:19.770 --> 03:40:24.286
I'm going to pull out my last

5066
03:40:24.286 --> 03:40:25.977
blueberry cupcake

5067
03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:28.460
that I got.

5068
03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:31.544
TALIESIN: How long has this been now?
LAURA: And, I'm going to--

5069
03:40:31.544 --> 03:40:32.377
LIAM: Everybody's been long.

5070
03:40:32.377 --> 03:40:33.490
MATT: It's been this long.

5071
03:40:33.490 --> 03:40:34.830
LIAM: Everybody's been long.

5072
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:35.960
Beau took forever.

5073
03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:37.520
MARISHA: I'm going to walk up and just--

5074
03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:38.620
SAM: You're not in there.

5075
03:40:38.620 --> 03:40:39.498
MARISHA: I'm walking up to the front door.

5076
03:40:39.498 --> 03:40:40.805
LAURA: I'm in the middle of talking!

5077
03:40:40.805 --> 03:40:42.347
SAM: Let her do her thing.

5078
03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:47.715
LAURA: Will you split this cupcake with me?

5079
03:40:49.090 --> 03:40:51.373
Have you ever had a blueberry cupcake?

5080
03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:57.220
MATT: "Hmm, I don't believe I have."

5081
03:40:59.910 --> 03:41:03.141
LAURA: See, I'm using my fingers to break it in half.

5082
03:41:03.141 --> 03:41:04.627
(laughter)

5083
03:41:04.627 --> 03:41:05.460
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

5084
03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.285
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

5085
03:41:09.285 --> 03:41:12.164
LAURA: (laughs)

5086
03:41:13.559 --> 03:41:15.880
(sighs)

5087
03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:17.180
24.

5088
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:20.840
MATT: She reaches out and grabs
the other half of the cupcake.

5089
03:41:21.760 --> 03:41:24.180
It's so small in her long,

5090
03:41:24.180 --> 03:41:26.070
curly fingers.
(groaning)

5091
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:29.087
Kind of (sniffs).

5092
03:41:29.946 --> 03:41:32.446
(wet chewing)

5093
03:41:34.370 --> 03:41:37.542
LAURA: That was sprinkled with the Dust of Deliciousness.

5094
03:41:38.498 --> 03:41:41.708
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

5095
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:47.880
Remind me what that is again.

5096
03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:52.307
LAURA: That is a dust that makes food taste much better.

5097
03:41:52.307 --> 03:41:54.430
(laughter)

5098
03:41:54.430 --> 03:41:56.552
And it also gives you a disadvantage

5099
03:41:56.552 --> 03:42:00.080
on wisdom checks and wisdom saving throws.

5100
03:42:00.080 --> 03:42:00.913
MATT: Okay.

5101
03:42:02.972 --> 03:42:06.372
LAURA: And I'm going to cast...

5102
03:42:06.372 --> 03:42:08.080
Modify Memory.

5103
03:42:10.338 --> 03:42:11.738
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

5104
03:42:12.868 --> 03:42:14.901
TRAVIS: Swing and hit, swing and hit.

5105
03:42:14.901 --> 03:42:17.474
MATT: Hold on, hold on.

5106
03:42:17.474 --> 03:42:18.852
TRAVIS: My soul hurts so much.

5107
03:42:18.852 --> 03:42:20.720
TRAVIS: Oh!
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

5108
03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:23.020
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

5109
03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:24.540
MATT: Okay.

5110
03:42:24.540 --> 03:42:26.670
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

5111
03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:28.970
LAURA: And I'm going--

5112
03:42:28.970 --> 03:42:29.890
SAM: Higher level.
LAURA: Well, I'm going

5113
03:42:29.890 --> 03:42:30.900
to see if it works.

5114
03:42:30.900 --> 03:42:34.090
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on.
MATT: (laughs) Okay, hold on.

5115
03:42:34.090 --> 03:42:35.180
LAURA: I mean, it doesn't matter.

5116
03:42:35.180 --> 03:42:37.520
SAM: It does.

5117
03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:38.353
LAURA: No, it doesn't.

5118
03:42:38.353 --> 03:42:40.300
It just affects how long ago I could do it.

5119
03:42:40.300 --> 03:42:42.550
This is within the last 24 hours.

5120
03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:46.890
So 5th-level is what I need to cast it at.

5121
03:42:46.890 --> 03:42:47.980
MATT: It is here.

5122
03:42:47.980 --> 03:42:49.290
Okay, there we go.

5123
03:42:49.290 --> 03:42:51.368
ASHLEY: [Inaudible]

5124
03:42:53.310 --> 03:42:55.393
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh my god, what?

5125
03:43:10.260 --> 03:43:11.390
MATT: Okay.

5126
03:43:11.390 --> 03:43:12.606
LAURA: Did I succeed?

5127
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:14.658
MATT: Yep.

5128
03:43:14.658 --> 03:43:17.075
(gasping)

5129
03:43:20.806 --> 03:43:22.740
LAURA: I'm going to make her believe--

5130
03:43:22.740 --> 03:43:23.880
MATT: Mm-hmm?

5131
03:43:23.880 --> 03:43:27.220
LAURA: That she enjoyed my company so very much

5132
03:43:27.220 --> 03:43:30.440
that she agreed to end Nott's curse,

5133
03:43:30.440 --> 03:43:33.046
because she liked hanging out so much.

5134
03:43:33.046 --> 03:43:36.091
(laughter)

5135
03:43:36.091 --> 03:43:39.774
And she hasn't had good company in a very long time.

5136
03:43:41.723 --> 03:43:44.731
ASHLEY: Laura. Fucking. Bailey.

5137
03:43:53.707 --> 03:43:56.553
MATT: Just going through the details of the spell here.

5138
03:43:56.553 --> 03:43:58.889
MARISHA: I'm having a heart attack.
TALIESIN: (panting)

5139
03:43:58.889 --> 03:44:01.639
TRAVIS: It was really deliberate.

5140
03:44:10.979 --> 03:44:12.229
LIAM: Out of the box.

5141
03:44:16.390 --> 03:44:21.390
MATT: Okay, so as you complete your incantation,

5142
03:44:24.420 --> 03:44:28.220
the minute of describing this shift in time, you--

5143
03:44:34.900 --> 03:44:36.550
LAURA: I get done with telling her that,

5144
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:38.420
and I just start going: (laughs)

5145
03:44:38.420 --> 03:44:40.816
Oh my god, you are so funny!

5146
03:44:40.816 --> 03:44:44.066
LAURA and MATT: (laugh)

5147
03:44:48.238 --> 03:44:51.406
MATT: "(sighs)

5148
03:44:51.406 --> 03:44:55.790
"It has been quite a while

5149
03:44:55.790 --> 03:45:00.790
"since I've taken just a moment

5150
03:45:01.730 --> 03:45:05.879
"to relax, I suppose."
LAURA: I know, right?

5151
03:45:05.879 --> 03:45:09.550
Everybody needs that.

5152
03:45:11.475 --> 03:45:16.192
MATT: "(sighs) Hmm."

5153
03:45:19.672 --> 03:45:21.800
LAURA: Thank you.
MATT: "Strange day."

5154
03:45:21.800 --> 03:45:24.420
LAURA: I know, but thank you so much.

5155
03:45:25.470 --> 03:45:26.970
It means a lot.

5156
03:45:29.780 --> 03:45:31.400
MATT: "You caught me in a good mood.

5157
03:45:36.135 --> 03:45:36.968
"Well,

5158
03:45:40.330 --> 03:45:45.080
"should you come across any more of those cupcakes--"

5159
03:45:45.080 --> 03:45:46.580
LAURA: I will send them your way.

5160
03:45:46.580 --> 03:45:49.860
MATT: "Do not be afraid to come visit again."

5161
03:45:49.860 --> 03:45:51.440
LAURA: I will definitely do that.

5162
03:45:51.440 --> 03:45:52.420
You know, they make some

5163
03:45:52.420 --> 03:45:56.477
that are called black moss cupcakes.

5164
03:45:56.477 --> 03:45:58.871
I will let you know, because, yeah.

5165
03:45:58.871 --> 03:46:01.371
(laughter)

5166
03:46:03.912 --> 03:46:04.745
MATT: "Well,

5167
03:46:07.760 --> 03:46:09.517
"the night grows late."

5168
03:46:09.517 --> 03:46:10.350
LAURA: Yeah, it does, it is.

5169
03:46:10.350 --> 03:46:12.670
It's getting dark outside.

5170
03:46:14.690 --> 03:46:17.140
MATT: "Is there anything else I can help you with,

5171
03:46:17.140 --> 03:46:21.780
"something that you have always wanted?"

5172
03:46:23.310 --> 03:46:26.470
LAURA: Just your company, you know, thank you.

5173
03:46:26.470 --> 03:46:30.280
Should I send my friend Nott in, or is it just,

5174
03:46:30.280 --> 03:46:33.180
does it, do you need to see her?

5175
03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:34.986
MATT: "Oh, it's fine,"

5176
03:46:34.986 --> 03:46:36.800
and you see the hand wave past,

5177
03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:39.400
and the shadows of the room grow extremely dark.

5178
03:46:39.400 --> 03:46:42.820
The lantern fights to maintain a flame.

5179
03:46:42.820 --> 03:46:45.053
And then it slowly expands back out.

5180
03:46:47.189 --> 03:46:48.623
"A deal is a deal."

5181
03:46:51.470 --> 03:46:52.635
LAURA: This has been fun.

5182
03:46:52.635 --> 03:46:55.052
MATT: "(sighs)"

5183
03:46:58.790 --> 03:47:01.010
LAURA: Well, it's a long journey back.

5184
03:47:01.010 --> 03:47:03.730
I guess we should head out, huh?

5185
03:47:04.906 --> 03:47:07.859
MATT: "Indeed."
LAURA: Thank you so much.

5186
03:47:07.859 --> 03:47:09.940
MATT: "(hisses)"
LAURA: See you later.

5187
03:47:09.940 --> 03:47:12.978
MATT: "See you sometime."
LAURA: Okay.

5188
03:47:12.978 --> 03:47:15.478
MATT: "(laughs) Huh."

5189
03:47:16.443 --> 03:47:18.383
LAURA: Does the door do the thing?

5190
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:20.383
MATT: "Right."

5191
03:47:20.383 --> 03:47:22.878
(laughter)

5192
03:47:24.480 --> 03:47:27.550
She seems very distracted and is trying

5193
03:47:27.550 --> 03:47:32.108
to piece together incongruent events,

5194
03:47:32.108 --> 03:47:34.820
but waves a hand and the door closes behind (thuds).

5195
03:47:34.820 --> 03:47:35.653
LAURA: Ooh!

5196
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:37.423
We got to go.

5197
03:47:37.423 --> 03:47:38.280
You're good.

5198
03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:39.130
Let's go.
SAM: What?

5199
03:47:39.130 --> 03:47:40.796
LAURA: Let's go! Come on, let's go.

5200
03:47:40.796 --> 03:47:41.629
Let's go.
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

5201
03:47:41.629 --> 03:47:42.720
LAURA: Let's get the fuck out of here.

5202
03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:44.990
TRAVIS: We're walking.
SAM: I need to get the tincture.

5203
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:46.530
LAURA: No, you don't.

5204
03:47:46.530 --> 03:47:47.970
Your curse is broken.

5205
03:47:47.970 --> 03:47:49.300
A deal has been made.

5206
03:47:49.300 --> 03:47:50.133
Everything's fine.

5207
03:47:50.133 --> 03:47:51.180
SAM: What did you give her?

5208
03:47:51.180 --> 03:47:52.130
TRAVIS: What do you mean it's been broken?

5209
03:47:52.130 --> 03:47:53.340
LAURA: I gave her something very precious.

5210
03:47:53.340 --> 03:47:54.173
Let's get the fuck out of here.

5211
03:47:54.173 --> 03:47:55.300
SAM: Your hands are still there.

5212
03:47:55.300 --> 03:47:56.133
LAURA: I know.

5213
03:47:56.133 --> 03:47:57.130
You know what?
SAM: What did you give her?

5214
03:47:57.130 --> 03:47:59.090
LAURA: She ended up being a really nice lady.

5215
03:47:59.090 --> 03:48:00.790
TRAVIS: Jester, Jester, are you sure?

5216
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:02.220
LAURA: Everything's fine.
TRAVIS: Then let's go.

5217
03:48:02.220 --> 03:48:03.160
Let's walk.
LAURA: I am so serious.

5218
03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:04.170
Let's go.

5219
03:48:04.170 --> 03:48:06.237
TALIESIN: Oh, go, okay.
LAURA: Yes.

5220
03:48:06.237 --> 03:48:07.070
Yes.
LIAM: All right, well,

5221
03:48:07.070 --> 03:48:10.620
we're leaving.
TRAVIS: Does Nott look the same?

5222
03:48:10.620 --> 03:48:11.520
MATT: Yeah, Nott looks the same.

5223
03:48:11.520 --> 03:48:12.850
LAURA: Yeah, it's just the curse is lifted,

5224
03:48:12.850 --> 03:48:15.842
and we can try that spell again, let's go.

5225
03:48:15.842 --> 03:48:17.520
Let's go, let's keep going,

5226
03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:19.210
let's go.
MATT: You gather your things

5227
03:48:19.210 --> 03:48:22.610
and rapidly follow the very insistent Jester back

5228
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:26.900
into now the night shadows of the swamp ahead of you.

5229
03:48:26.900 --> 03:48:28.830
SAM: Oh god.
MATT: Still exhausted,

5230
03:48:30.180 --> 03:48:33.790
still recovering from the initial journey,

5231
03:48:34.650 --> 03:48:38.270
you briskly vanish into the shadows of night.

5232
03:48:38.270 --> 03:48:39.270
LIAM: 200 feet behind them,

5233
03:48:39.270 --> 03:48:40.846
my shadow Caleb's going boop, boop, boop, boop.

5234
03:48:40.846 --> 03:48:42.361
(laughter)

5235
03:48:42.361 --> 03:48:44.690
ASHLEY: Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait!

5236
03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:47.523
MATT: As you make your way into the deep mists,

5237
03:48:48.530 --> 03:48:50.570
we're going to end tonight's session there.

5238
03:48:50.570 --> 03:48:52.319
SAM: What the fuck just happened?
TALIESIN: You fucking beast!

5239
03:48:52.319 --> 03:48:54.820
You fucking beast!
ASHLEY: That was amazing!

5240
03:48:54.820 --> 03:48:56.500
TALIESIN: Oh my god, what a troll!

5241
03:48:56.500 --> 03:48:58.930
TRAVIS: I can't even begin to digest,

5242
03:49:00.977 --> 03:49:03.850
the Dust of Deliciousness on the cupcake?

5243
03:49:03.850 --> 03:49:04.683
LAURA: Well, I've been holding on the

5244
03:49:04.683 --> 03:49:07.060
fucking Dust of Deliciousness.
MATT: I had forgotten about

5245
03:49:07.060 --> 03:49:08.555
that fucking item.

5246
03:49:09.690 --> 03:49:11.440
LAURA: And it's still good for five more servings.

5247
03:49:11.440 --> 03:49:13.080
LIAM: So obviously, in the moment,

5248
03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:15.910
a legendary moment of this campaign.

5249
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:18.310
MATT: Fun point of order,

5250
03:49:19.650 --> 03:49:24.310
fun point of order, the first roll I rolled was a two.

5251
03:49:24.310 --> 03:49:26.880
Then I was like, "Oh, she's disadvantage.

5252
03:49:26.880 --> 03:49:29.580
"Well no, but she has advantage on magic resistance,

5253
03:49:29.580 --> 03:49:31.230
"so it's just a roll,"

5254
03:49:31.230 --> 03:49:32.940
and still a fail.
LAURA: It was a two!

5255
03:49:32.940 --> 03:49:34.520
TRAVIS: That's what your face journey was.

5256
03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:35.900
It was a complicated one.

5257
03:49:35.900 --> 03:49:38.360
MATT: It was like, "Ooh fuck, wait, no, disadvantage, fuck!"

5258
03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:40.630
TALIESIN: You completely fucking Gretel-ed his Hansel,

5259
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:41.940
like it was just--
ASHLEY: Yes!

5260
03:49:41.940 --> 03:49:43.240
MATT: Yeah.

5261
03:49:43.240 --> 03:49:47.220
TALIESIN: Oh my god, you fed a witch a baked good, how?

5262
03:49:47.220 --> 03:49:50.570
TRAVIS: For every Inflict Wounds that has failed,

5263
03:49:50.570 --> 03:49:53.584
that your dice have failed you on--

5264
03:49:53.584 --> 03:49:55.834
That was payback.
ASHLEY: That was the greatest.

5265
03:49:57.141 --> 03:49:58.162
LIAM: That was a major moment.

5266
03:49:58.162 --> 03:49:59.828
SAM: I would've started a war again.

5267
03:49:59.828 --> 03:50:00.661
LAURA: I know!

5268
03:50:00.661 --> 03:50:02.010
(laughter)

5269
03:50:02.010 --> 03:50:04.520
TRAVIS: Beau was about to just walk away from everything.

5270
03:50:04.520 --> 03:50:06.550
SAM: I would've sacrificed thousands of lives.

5271
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:08.820
MARISHA: No, made up my mind,

5272
03:50:08.820 --> 03:50:10.320
so still processing.

5273
03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:12.580
TALIESIN: You sacrificed a cupcake!

5274
03:50:12.580 --> 03:50:14.913
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Jesus!

5275
03:50:14.913 --> 03:50:17.060
LAURA: And it was probably pretty moldy.

5276
03:50:17.060 --> 03:50:19.210
It was an old-ass cupcake.

5277
03:50:19.210 --> 03:50:23.540
LIAM: World War III or a Hostess cupcake (laughs).

5278
03:50:23.540 --> 03:50:25.050
MARISHA: Is Modify Memory permanent?

5279
03:50:25.050 --> 03:50:25.883
LAURA: Yes.

5280
03:50:25.883 --> 03:50:27.825
LIAM: Unless somebody gets it out of them.
ASHLEY: It's permanent?

5281
03:50:27.825 --> 03:50:29.970
LAURA: Yep, it's permanent.

5282
03:50:29.970 --> 03:50:31.020
She will forever--

5283
03:50:31.020 --> 03:50:33.810
MATT: It's permanent until Greater Restoration

5284
03:50:33.810 --> 03:50:35.522
or Remove Curse is cast.

5285
03:50:35.522 --> 03:50:37.390
LAURA: And if they don't know that anything happened,

5286
03:50:37.390 --> 03:50:39.790
then why would they ever ask for that?

5287
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:41.197
TALIESIN: Yeah, it will only undo if something--

5288
03:50:41.197 --> 03:50:42.877
MATT: She just seemed to be dealing

5289
03:50:42.877 --> 03:50:46.100
with the incongruent elements of her day's events.

5290
03:50:46.100 --> 03:50:47.566
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's a fair chance

5291
03:50:47.566 --> 03:50:49.899
we've rakshasa-ed this shit.

5292
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:54.060
Matt: A very long-living, very intelligent

5293
03:50:54.060 --> 03:50:55.480
and conniving individual

5294
03:50:55.480 --> 03:50:58.260
that has made their living feeding off the misery

5295
03:50:58.260 --> 03:51:00.030
of other people that she's tricked them into--

5296
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:01.520
LAURA: Oh my god.

5297
03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:03.550
Matt: But we'll pick this up, next Thursday!

5298
03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:06.240
TALIESIN: Oh, oh!
TRAVIS: I just cannot believe it.

5299
03:51:06.240 --> 03:51:07.130
TALIESIN: Holy shit.

5300
03:51:07.130 --> 03:51:09.080
ASHLEY: I am so proud of you, Laura Bailey.

5301
03:51:09.080 --> 03:51:11.770
TALIESIN: That was so clutch.
TRAVIS: That was some goddamned

5302
03:51:11.770 --> 03:51:14.610
walk-off, ninth inning grand slam World Series shit.

5303
03:51:14.610 --> 03:51:16.412
MATT: As a dungeon master,

5304
03:51:17.380 --> 03:51:20.850
that was one of the more frustrating moments,

5305
03:51:20.850 --> 03:51:22.860
like as a person that's built

5306
03:51:22.860 --> 03:51:26.180
to an intense encounter like this,

5307
03:51:27.650 --> 03:51:29.970
and one of the most proud I've been

5308
03:51:29.970 --> 03:51:31.600
of a player outsmarting me.

5309
03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:32.830
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
TRAVIS: Wow.

5310
03:51:32.830 --> 03:51:33.663
LIAM: It was cool, though,

5311
03:51:33.663 --> 03:51:36.610
because we could see your, like, vague disappointment

5312
03:51:36.610 --> 03:51:39.880
of like, "No, this is my big-- no, I'm leaning into this."

5313
03:51:39.880 --> 03:51:44.020
TRAVIS: There is a hidden map over there, behind us,

5314
03:51:44.020 --> 03:51:47.050
special curtain, that we're never going to see.

5315
03:51:47.050 --> 03:51:48.220
LAURA: We're never going to see.
SAM: Maybe.

5316
03:51:48.220 --> 03:51:49.320
LAURA: Well, maybe.

5317
03:51:50.369 --> 03:51:52.360
MATT: Well, we'll see.
LAURA: You don't know.

5318
03:51:52.360 --> 03:51:53.310
She might come after us.
SAM: We could walk into the swamp

5319
03:51:53.310 --> 03:51:54.400
and hear a scream.

5320
03:51:54.400 --> 03:51:57.540
LAURA: Yep, that's true.
(Ashley screeches)

5321
03:51:57.540 --> 03:52:01.150
MATT: But nevertheless, that's
the end of our session tonight.

5322
03:52:01.150 --> 03:52:03.520
We'll be back with this next Thursday.

5323
03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:04.440
TALIESIN: Fudge, wow.
LAURA: Oh man,

5324
03:52:04.440 --> 03:52:06.300
I want to throw up.
ASHLEY: I'm so happy.

5325
03:52:07.537 --> 03:52:09.880
MATT: I'm going to have to just chew on that one tonight.

5326
03:52:09.880 --> 03:52:11.150
Holy fuck, Laura.

5327
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:13.570
TRAVIS: We're, like, creepy as fuck in each one of those,

5328
03:52:13.570 --> 03:52:15.160
what do we call them?

5329
03:52:15.160 --> 03:52:16.190
Interviews?

5330
03:52:16.190 --> 03:52:18.120
What a session!

5331
03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:20.060
SAM: What are these long-fingered creatures

5332
03:52:20.060 --> 03:52:22.360
that we've encountered?
TRAVIS: Double elbows?

5333
03:52:22.360 --> 03:52:24.880
MATT: Well, like, Keona the Keen just happened

5334
03:52:24.880 --> 03:52:26.920
to be a character you went to.

5335
03:52:26.920 --> 03:52:28.260
This one's been planned for a long time.

5336
03:52:28.260 --> 03:52:30.460
LAURA: Oh my god.

5337
03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:31.570
ASHLEY: I thought you were going to go, like,

5338
03:52:31.570 --> 03:52:34.690
give her a tarot card reading or something.

5339
03:52:34.690 --> 03:52:36.410
LAURA: Something equally stupid.
ASHLEY: I was like, "she's going to

5340
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:37.243
"do something weird."
MATT: I had cards ready.

5341
03:52:37.243 --> 03:52:38.351
ASHLEY: But I had no idea.

5342
03:52:38.351 --> 03:52:39.420
LAURA: Oh, see?

5343
03:52:39.420 --> 03:52:40.280
I've been waiting.
TALIESIN: I know.

5344
03:52:40.280 --> 03:52:41.770
I've got, like, two more in there.

5345
03:52:41.770 --> 03:52:43.190
Yeah, got, like, three more now.

5346
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:44.258
ASHLEY: That was so cool.
TALIESIN: Oh, now I can turn on

5347
03:52:44.258 --> 03:52:45.525
my phone again.

5348
03:52:45.525 --> 03:52:47.580
MATT: My Tactics Ogre.

5349
03:52:49.165 --> 03:52:50.240
LAURA: Oh my god.

5350
03:52:50.240 --> 03:52:53.363
MATT: Cards there, just in case somebody wanted to go ahead

5351
03:52:53.363 --> 03:52:55.300
and get a reading based on them wanting something

5352
03:52:55.300 --> 03:52:57.120
and making an exchange like Thoreau did.

5353
03:52:57.120 --> 03:52:59.440
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.
TRAVIS: (sighs)

5354
03:52:59.440 --> 03:53:01.980
MATT: Oh, man, all righty, well, nevertheless--

5355
03:53:01.980 --> 03:53:02.813
TALIESIN: Fuck.

5356
03:53:03.921 --> 03:53:06.080
MATT: Thank you, guys, so much for joining us.

5357
03:53:06.080 --> 03:53:07.330
We'll pick it up next Thursday.

5358
03:53:07.330 --> 03:53:08.780
We love you very much.

5359
03:53:08.780 --> 03:53:11.139
And is it Thursday yet? Good night.

5360
03:53:11.139 --> 03:53:12.585
TRAVIS: Not for another week!

5361
03:53:12.585 --> 03:53:13.418
MATT: I know.

5362
03:53:13.418 --> 03:53:15.216
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

5363
03:53:15.216 --> 03:53:18.383
(dramatic orchestral music)

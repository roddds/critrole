00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.200
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the night's episode

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.220
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.987
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:08.669
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:09.735
MARISHA: For five years!

6
00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:11.790
MATT: Five years, our five year anniversary,

7
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.919
which is insane, it's insane.

8
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.702
SAM: ♪ Insane in the membrane ♪
MATT: Indeed.

9
00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:19.158
OFF-SCREEN: ♪ Insane in the brain ♪

10
00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:22.033
MATT: Yeah, a lot of things are insane now.

11
00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.860
Right now, today in particular, things are really insane.

12
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.700
So I just want to take a moment tell everyone, like,

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.350
things are crazy right now.

14
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.220
We're all doing the best we can with it.

15
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.040
Do your research, stay healthy, take care of yourselves,

16
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.730
we're doing the same here.

17
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.080
Let's make tonight a celebration,

18
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.730
that is also a distraction from today's chaos

19
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.368
and a moment of respite amongst the rest of our focus.

20
00:00:46.368 --> 00:00:47.486
SAM: (giggling)

21
00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:48.800
LIAM: A time to remember what's important.

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.680
MATT: Exactly, exactly.

23
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.740
And tonight, we have been streaming

24
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.310
this crazy little D&amp;D group for five years,

25
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.143
which is-- I can't even fathom

26
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.660
considering what this could have been,

27
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.920
so thank you for joining us

28
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.150
and being a part of this celebration.

29
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.320
And let's go ahead and get into some

30
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.900
of our announcements for tonight

31
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.160
before we can jump into our session.

32
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.220
Beginning with our first sponsor of the night,

33
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.173
our friends at Griffon's Saddlebag. Sam.

34
00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:16.810
SAM: Tonight's episode is sponsored by our friend

35
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.101
and fan of the show, The Griffon's Saddlebag.

36
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.590
Maker of illustrated and game-ready magic items

37
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.540
that can be applied to any 5e campaign,

38
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.443
campaign--

39
00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:29.496
(chuckles)
LAURA: Campaign, campaign.

40
00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:31.920
SAM: The first book, a 200 page compendium containing

41
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.090
365 illustrated magic items, treasure tables, subclasses,

42
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.620
settings and villains is available on Kickstarter.

43
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.900
Each item, designed, written

44
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.740
and balanced with 5e in mind,

45
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.050
making them easy and exciting to pick up and implement

46
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.130
in any campaign that might need a little upgrade

47
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.300
from the standard loot.

48
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.960
You can support the effort and check out

49
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.330
the exciting Kickstarter rewards and stretch goals

50
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.400
like the awesome official Griffon's Saddlebag.

51
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.233
ALL: Whoa.

52
00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:00.510
SAM: You see here.
MATT: Where did that come from?

53
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.355
LAURA: Is this real?

54
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.850
SAM: This is a real Kickstarter reward.

55
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.301
LAURA: This is really cool, that's so cool.

56
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:09.870
SAM: You can check it out at thegriffonssaddlebag.com

57
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.300
that's G-R-I-F-F-O-N.

58
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.620
Your support makes a big difference.

59
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.280
Let's see what mine came with.

60
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.100
LAURA: Oh no.

61
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.933
SAM: All right.

62
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.641
Oh, I always carry this with me wherever I go.

63
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.260
Sure, that's standard.

64
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.017
Oh, I was wondering where my change went.

65
00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:27.302
(laughter)

66
00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:28.135
TRAVIS: You're so rich.

67
00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:30.320
LAURA: Is this real money?
SAM: A good year, a good year.

68
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.294
LAURA: No, it's fake.

69
00:02:31.294 --> 00:02:32.910
(laughter)

70
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.480
SAM: And oh, what's this?

71
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.230
A song I wrote to commemorate

72
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.402
the five year anniversary of our show.

73
00:02:38.402 --> 00:02:39.830
(giggles)

74
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.710
MATT: Oh, boy.

75
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.043
LAURA: Yeah. Cheers.

76
00:02:42.043 --> 00:02:43.667
SAM: It's actually sentimental,

77
00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.308
it's not stupid.

MARISHA: Aw, that's great!

91
00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:25.700
SAM: Go check out The Griffon's Saddlebag thing,

92
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.350
I threw it away, but The Griffon's Saddlebag's really cool

93
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.920
and it smells like leather, get it!

94
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.870
MATT: I've actually been following them

95
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.990
on Instagram for a long time,

96
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.990
the illustrations are badass.

97
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.485
ASHLEY: Wait, I got to see this.
MATT: It's really cool.

98
00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:38.330
I'm a backer of it, you should be, too.

99
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.767
They're really good.
TRAVIS: Some graduating class is going to

100
00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:42.170
sing that during graduation ceremonies.

101
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.239
LIAM: You've spent five years conditioning us to bullshit.

102
00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.510
(laughter)

103
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.343
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

104
00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:51.709
That was really sweet and check out The Griffon's Saddlebag.

105
00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.700
TALIESIN: That's super fancy.

106
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.730
MATT: Second sponsor for the night,

107
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.350
are our friends who have been following us since

108
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.730
the beginning of the campaign, D&amp;D Beyond.

109
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.904
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond ♪

110
00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:03.703
MATT: If you haven't yet checked them out
and you haven't heard it,

111
00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:05.920
then is this your first time watching the show or just--

112
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.586
What the hell are you doing? Give it a shot.

113
00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:08.780
It's an awesome online digital tool

114
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.520
for keeping track your campaigns, your characters

115
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.670
and everything about fifth edition D&amp;D and beyond.

116
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.430
They have a bunch of great tools on there for preparing

117
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.940
your campaigns, encounter builders,

118
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.850
all kinds of other stuff making custom items,

119
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.850
check them out at d&amp;dbeyond.link/criticalrole.

120
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.810
And on that note, you will be able to get all

121
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.210
the stuff from the Wildemount Guide,

122
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.850
which comes out next week on D&amp;D Beyond.

123
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.999
You can pre-order that now.
It will be available next Tuesday.

124
00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:37.367
As part of that, too, next Tuesday is the actual release of

125
00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:38.758
The Explorer's Guide to Wildemount!

126
00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:41.100
(cheering)

127
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.100
Super weird to have that coming out finally.

128
00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:48.810
Super stoked for you guys to check it out.

129
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.580
Me and a bunch of other really talented people worked hard

130
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.040
on making this as awesome a book

131
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.670
as we possibly can for you.

132
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.587
For players, GMs alike.

133
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.270
Even if you don't play, it's a lot of fun stuff in there

134
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.500
to follow along with the world lore,

135
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.890
but hopefully it'll inspire you to write

136
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.645
your own campaigns in Wildemount,

137
00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:06.875
and throw your friends

138
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:08.650
in the same chaos that I do mine.

139
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.200
So it comes out next Tuesday.

140
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.470
And if you haven't yet, you can reserve your copy now

141
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.080
at your local game store or at the Critical Role shop

142
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.390
or Amazon, wherever else books are found online

143
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.557
in the Tabletop RPG Space.

144
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.020
Next announcement we have, this Monday, March 16th.

145
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.600
At 7:00pm Pacific here on our Twitch channel,

146
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.637
we will be streaming the Doom One-Shot.

147
00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:36.081
(cheering)
(singing intense rock music)

148
00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:36.914
LAURA: This is going to be so awesome!

149
00:05:36.914 --> 00:05:40.570
MATT: Yep, to celebrate the coming release of DOOM Eternal.

150
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.780
I have been a fan of the DOOM franchise since way back

151
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.720
in, god, it was in middle school for me,

152
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.695
like, yeah, early-mid '90s.

153
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.600
I've a hard time removing my memories of DOOM II

154
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.670
with Nine Inch Nails' Downward Spiral, and Soundgarden.

155
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.420
There's certain songs that came out of that era

156
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.000
that we listened to while playing DOOM II

157
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.750
that to this day, all I can think of

158
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.430
is, like, "Knee Deep in the Dead".

159
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.140
When I hear "The Day I Tried to Live" and stuff like that

160
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.106
so anyway.
ASHLEY: Downward Spiral was on

161
00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.690
<i>repeat</i> for me.
MATT: Oh god,

162
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.180
that album was so good.

163
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.013
Anyway, enough about that.

164
00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:13.930
This one-shot's going to be amazing.

165
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.820
We have some fantastic guests coming to join us

166
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.890
as well some players here at the table.

167
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.137
We have our own Sam Riegel--

168
00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:20.970
SAM: Oh.

169
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.200
MATT: Laura Bailey--
LAURA: Oh!

170
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.470
MATT: Coming to join for this cast as well

171
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.510
is Taliesin Jaffe,
TALIESIN and LAURA: Ooh.

172
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.950
MATT: We have Anjali and Jasmine,

173
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.635
two amazing players and friends.

174
00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:31.800
It'll be Jasmine's first time

175
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.960
with us on stream here in the studio,

176
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.940
so excited to have her down here.

177
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.330
And Anjali will be joining us here

178
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.280
at this table, I believe, for the first time for the game

179
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.090
as we had her as part of UnDeadwood before.

180
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.330
So I'll be playing a bunch of awesome demons,

181
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.940
involved in the assault on earth, as it is hell on earth.

182
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.780
And super stoked about it.

183
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.480
I'll be GMing it myself

184
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.600
and I'm super excited for you guys to check it out.

185
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.933
I've been, like, super way too excited for this game.

186
00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.050
(laughter)
It's absurd.

187
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.810
I haven't had this much fun with a one-shot in a while.

188
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.050
Like, I have fun with them,
this one I'm super stoked for.

189
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.175
So definitely check it out.
MARISHA: The crew's been

190
00:07:04.175 --> 00:07:05.791
busting their ass on it, too,

191
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.369
so it's going to look great.
MATT: Everyone's been

192
00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.772
kicking ass on it.

193
00:07:09.772 --> 00:07:11.240
Check it out, the VOD will be available

194
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.720
immediately on our Twitch channel,

195
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.630
for all of our channel subscribers

196
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.660
and on YouTube immediately on Wednesday, March 18th.

197
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.930
You can check it out.

198
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.810
DOOM Eternal itself lunches next week on Xbox,

199
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.580
PS4, PC and Stadia, March 20th, next Friday.

200
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.530
Not this coming Friday, but the next.

201
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.910
Yeah, check it out.

202
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.080
Laura, you have some announcements to make, I think.

203
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.814
LAURA: We have a poster!

204
00:07:35.814 --> 00:07:38.106
(laughter)

205
00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:41.390
To celebrate our fifth anniversary.

206
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.689
We asked our buddy, Hugo Cardenas

207
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:47.423
to illustrate this thing, holy moly.

208
00:07:47.423 --> 00:07:50.729
TRAVIS: Hugo, it's so good.
ALL: Wow.

209
00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:55.729
LAURA: It's big! It's got all of our characters, like, ever.

210
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.790
It's got all the guys from the first campaign, the second--

211
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.027
SAM: Oh, the player characters.

212
00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:02.880
LAURA: We got the Darrington Brigade,

213
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.250
we got a lot of Matt's characters, too.

214
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.660
There's just a whole bunch of people.

215
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.785
LIAM: We've been staring at this thing

216
00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:12.490
in the office for weeks; you just get lost in it.

217
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.850
MATT: There's so many little, like, Easter eggs in there,

218
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.400
little character--

219
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.450
LIAM: That's it, that's all you get.

220
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.070
LAURA: That's the sneak peak, that's all you get.

221
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.805
It's in the US and UK stores right now.

222
00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:26.709
MATT: There it is.

223
00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:28.259
TALIESIN: Hey, that-- okay.

224
00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:29.330
MATT: I think one of my favorite little moments

225
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.390
in that is the Bright Queen and King Dwendal both looking up

226
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.368
at J'mon Sa Ord in their dragon form, all just like, "Hi."

227
00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:38.201
It's a lot of fun little Easter eggs in there.

228
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:39.150
LAURA: I'll show you, but you have

229
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.877
to, like, look at it in person to see that.

230
00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:44.984
TRAVIS: Nice. Good, good, good.

231
00:08:44.984 --> 00:08:47.793
SAM: By the way, we have like, Jesus.

232
00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:50.043
LIAM: (cat yowling and hissing)

233
00:08:50.043 --> 00:08:51.020
SAM: We have, like,

234
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.260
I think I counted 17 beverages on the table right now.

235
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.559
TRAVIS: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

236
00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:01.493
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15--

237
00:09:01.493 --> 00:09:03.226
TALIESIN: And then two--
TRAVIS: 16--

238
00:09:03.226 --> 00:09:05.520
SAM: That hydro flask over there.
TRAVIS: 17.

239
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.799
MATT: What better time to drink yourself

240
00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:08.924
into a stupor than during a pandemic?

241
00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:10.443
MARISHA: Kyle, we need more drinks.

242
00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:12.900
(laughter)

243
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.900
MATT: It's like Andromeda Strain, right?

244
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.740
If you drink enough alcohol, it can't get into your system.

245
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.850
ASHLEY: Yeah, sure.

246
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.800
MATT: Anyway.
TALIESIN: Why not?

247
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.790
MATT: Much love to you guys,

248
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.856
happy five year anniversary to this incredible community.

249
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.740
To many years more of supporting each other,

250
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.210
of being lights in the dark for each other,

251
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.520
for telling stories to inspire each other.

252
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.010
And to jump into tonight's episode of

253
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.302
Critical Role.

MATT: And welcome back.

288
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.270
So last we left off:

289
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.150
The Mighty Nein had made their way to Nicodranas.

290
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.680
They had discovered some secrets in regards to one

291
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.650
of their allies, Essek, and his involvement with

292
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.815
much of the events that led to the current war between

293
00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:38.850
the Kryn dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire.

294
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.690
After a deep discussion,

295
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.870
you had left business in Nicodranas,

296
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.060
gathered your ship and made your way with

297
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.580
the armada towards the meeting point.

298
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.190
Where a negotiation between these two factions

299
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.270
is to take place.

300
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.320
After some days at sea, the storm began to brew,

301
00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.240
dreams were had, invoked by an element of divinity

302
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.240
and one's path to embrace who they are.

303
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.840
And whatever this path may be,

304
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.291
as well as being awoken

305
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:15.180
by a pained nightmare-cum-reality,

306
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.950
As Fjord found himself under attack

307
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.710
by what was immediately obvious to be agents of Uk'otoa.

308
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.770
ALL: (whispered) Uk'otoa.

309
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.770
MATT: Seeking the still-hanging elements

310
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.580
of his unveiling and freedom.

311
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.700
A battle took place where these various deep sea creatures,

312
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.840
these mutated and altered entities

313
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.800
here under the will of Uk'otoa, stormed the ship,

314
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.280
crawling through its many decks, to assault you

315
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.290
as Fjord fought valiantly to keep them at bay,

316
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.943
and you manage to come and support him in dire need.

317
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.270
During the final moments of this climactic battle

318
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.590
in the midst of the rolling seas,

319
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.740
the flashing lightning, curling thunder

320
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.198
and the waves of rain

321
00:13:05.198 --> 00:13:07.870
battering down upon the deck,

322
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.880
both Orly, the bard tortle,

323
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.630
and your friend and companion, Fjord, lay slain

324
00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:21.770
before you dealt the final blow to the assailants.

325
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.010
And that is where we left off.

326
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.530
Mighty Nein, as you gather here

327
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.170
on the wet decks of this ship,

328
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.730
still rolling with the ocean as the storm batters onward,

329
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.670
you look down upon the scattered bits of blood

330
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.753
and your unmoving allies.

331
00:13:39.504 --> 00:13:40.880
LAURA: Caduceus, Caduceus!

332
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.088
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over and--

333
00:13:44.088 --> 00:13:45.650
LAURA: I'm going to run over.

334
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.590
TALIESIN: Quickly--
SAM: Caduceus,

335
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.080
why are you walking?

336
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.040
LAURA: Come on, Caduceus!

337
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.707
TALIESIN: Going to quickly cast

338
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.950
Gentle Repose really quickly.

339
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.950
MATT: Okay.

340
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.750
TALIESIN: On-- which should give us a second.

341
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.580
SAM: What's that do?
MARISHA: What are you doing?

342
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.805
TALIESIN: Gentle Repose means that

343
00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:07.640
the time limit is extended.

344
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.990
LAURA: On both of them or who?

345
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.650
TALIESIN: I'm going to do both of them really quickly.

346
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.720
MARISHA: How do you mean?

347
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.600
SAM: Time limit?

348
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.169
TALIESIN: So that's--

349
00:14:14.169 --> 00:14:16.417
MATT: "The target is protected from decay

350
00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:17.750
"and can't become undead."

351
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.670
MATT: It also extends the time limit on raising

352
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.340
the target from the dead since days spent under

353
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.793
the influence--
LAURA: Why not just cast

354
00:14:22.793 --> 00:14:24.170
Revivify?!

355
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.470
TALIESIN: Quickly detecting magic.

356
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.260
Do I see anything inside Fjord?

357
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.760
SAM: It's two rounds.

358
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.780
MATT: You do not see anything.

359
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.090
TALIESIN: That's a bonus action.

360
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.690
MATT: I will say that the purposes of this,

361
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.680
there is nothing emanating an aura.

362
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.255
MATT: And then taking the diamond and pushing Revivify

363
00:14:42.255 --> 00:14:43.630
as quickly as possible.

364
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.600
MATT: Okay.

365
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.652
So I've rolled this privately in the past,

366
00:14:48.652 --> 00:14:51.090
because I misremember my own rules.

367
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.120
So I'm going to have you,
which is part of the intended design

368
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.730
to go ahead and roll a d20 for me

369
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.610
and add your spell casting modifier.

370
00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.490
LAURA: I'm going to be holding onto Fjord's hand.

371
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.107
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Does anybody else want to do anything in

372
00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.123
the time it took me to do that little thing?

373
00:15:01.123 --> 00:15:03.066
LAURA: I'm going to reach over and try to cast

374
00:15:03.066 --> 00:15:04.260
the same thing on Orly

375
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.880
because I don't know how much time I have on Orly.

376
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.840
MATT: So you have a diamond as well?

377
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.860
LAURA: Yes, I've just got a 300 gold.
MATT: Okay.

378
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.588
TALIESIN: Where is my spell casting--?

379
00:15:11.588 --> 00:15:13.063
MATT: It's your wisdom modifier.

380
00:15:13.063 --> 00:15:14.440
TALIESIN: Oh, wisdom modifier?

381
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.920
LIAM: Last episode was land by Fjord, so I guess

382
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.900
I'm sitting him up towards Jester.

383
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.910
MARISHA: And I'll take his other hand.

384
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.743
MATT: Okay.

385
00:15:22.743 --> 00:15:25.110
MARISHA: Just hold onto him.

386
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.710
Come on, Caduceus.

387
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.430
TALIESIN: Don't suck, come on, don't hit it.

388
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.230
Okay, that's 11.

389
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.185
MATT: That's an 11.

390
00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:35.130
MARISHA: With your modifier?

391
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.047
LAURA: Why would, why would?

392
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.613
MATT: Okay.

393
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.880
Because Fjord had not previously died,

394
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.798
that leaves the DC at a certain number.

395
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.340
So as you focus

396
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.690
and pushing the diamond down towards where

397
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.260
the most gaping wound is.

398
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.620
You watch as it slowly turns to dust within the wound

399
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.970
and become a congealed,

400
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.400
like gray material into the exposed blood.

401
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.160
There's a moment of pause before

402
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.576
the divine energy you channel

403
00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:16.400
through the Wildmother creates

404
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.080
a mess of vines that begin to grow from

405
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.880
the wound and wrap around his torso.

406
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.320
As the vines begin to condense and create

407
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.300
a small nest or a cocoon above where the wound is,

408
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.220
you watch as they turn bright green,

409
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.090
then turn brown and die.

410
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.700
And wither, the leaves of the vines

411
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.190
immediately crumbling and decaying to dust.

412
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.680
As they do, leaving the wound,

413
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.263
partially healed and you pause for a moment

414
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.333
and you

415
00:16:50.316 --> 00:16:53.890
hear the breath begin to come back into the lungs.

416
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.680
TALIESIN: Cure Wounds level three.
LAURA: Thank god.

417
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.670
MATT: Go ahead and roll for that.

418
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.830
LAURA: I reached and I kiss Fjord on the forehead

419
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.226
and I immediately spin around and cast

420
00:17:00.226 --> 00:17:01.860
Revivify on Orly.

421
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.956
MATT: Okay, you may join the table again.

422
00:17:04.956 --> 00:17:08.420
TRAVIS: Some ups and downs in that description.
TALIESIN: Is he technically unconscious?

423
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.253
MATT: Revivify?

424
00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:13.520
LAURA: No, he comes back

425
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.430
to one hit point--
MATT: One hit point,

426
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.263
so he is conscious.

427
00:17:15.263 --> 00:17:16.630
TALIESIN: Okay, nevermind then.

428
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.521
All right, I'll tell you how many hit points

429
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:20.271
you have in a second.

430
00:17:25.893 --> 00:17:27.980
MATT: But the DC has increased for the next time, too.

431
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.130
TALIESIN: 23.

432
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.270
So you're at 24 hit points.

433
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.440
TRAVIS: 24?

434
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.831
LAURA: Do I need to roll for Orly?

435
00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:34.664
MATT: You do.

436
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.580
So in that moment you reach over,

437
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.800
holding on and wishing for the aid of The Traveler,

438
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.633
and you all--

439
00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.633
now that you've seen him

440
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.660
for a brief moment, you can see as Jester, her small,

441
00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.040
diminutive form on this massive deck of the ship,

442
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.020
the storm battering around her, putting her hands

443
00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.011
on this large, shelled, unmoving, still creature.

444
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.720
You see the green cloak momentarily engulf

445
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.950
her before it vanishes when you blink.

446
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.670
Not sure if it was there even to begin with.

447
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.562
And what did you roll?

448
00:18:09.562 --> 00:18:10.645
LAURA: 19.

449
00:18:10.645 --> 00:18:11.478
MATT: 19?

450
00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.750
There's a moment of stillness before the chest inhales

451
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.420
and the body begins to stern, as it does it

452
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.307
leans into one of the bagpipes and you hear this.

453
00:18:22.307 --> 00:18:25.990
(discordant bagpipe notes)

454
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:30.684
Before a hand "(grumbling).

455
00:18:30.684 --> 00:18:32.450
"Well.

456
00:18:33.707 --> 00:18:36.482
"Hmm.

457
00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:40.195
"M-m-mighty sore.

458
00:18:41.345 --> 00:18:44.690
LAURA: I'll cast third level-- oh wait. (giggling)

459
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.560
No, I won't heal you because I don't have,

460
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.540
I'm going to Healing Word you, no.

461
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.931
SAM: Because you didn't.
LAURA: Because I that prepared.

462
00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:51.022
SAM: Because you didn't--
LAURA: Shut up.

463
00:18:51.022 --> 00:18:52.755
SAM: You didn't prepare the Cure Wounds spell.

464
00:18:52.755 --> 00:18:54.407
TALIESIN: I'm starting to Prayer of Healing,

465
00:18:54.407 --> 00:18:55.240
so in 10 minutes,

466
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.164
the six most hurt people on deck are going to get a boost.

467
00:18:59.164 --> 00:19:00.690
LAURA: Okay, well I'll still Healing Word him.

468
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.023
Because why not?

469
00:19:03.354 --> 00:19:05.129
At 2nd-level.

470
00:19:05.129 --> 00:19:05.962
MATT: Okay.

471
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.630
TALIESIN: In 10 minutes, the six
most hurt people get 21 hit points.

472
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.463
MATT: Okay.

473
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.574
LAURA: 11 points of healing to Orly.

474
00:19:16.574 --> 00:19:18.250
MATT: That's decent.

475
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.260
LIAM: Still propping Fjord up with both.

476
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.550
Just breathe.

477
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.860
Breathe slow.
LAURA: I spin back around to Fjord.

478
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.630
MARISHA: You all right?

479
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.600
I mean aside from no?

480
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.240
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I'm fine.

481
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.073
Thank you.

482
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.622
Are they all gone?

483
00:19:35.622 --> 00:19:39.508
LAURA: I think so. Yeah, they were really,

484
00:19:39.508 --> 00:19:42.370
really hacking you up.

485
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.470
TRAVIS: Yeah, it feels pretty shitty
inside of my chest right now.

486
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.360
Not going to lie.

487
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.440
MARISHA: I think your lung is still punctured.

488
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.060
TRAVIS: Really?
MARISHA: Yeah.

489
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.750
TRAVIS: Oh god. Like, you can see it?

490
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.080
MARISHA: You can see a little bit of a puncture wound.

491
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.110
TRAVIS: Just push it back in.

492
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.640
MARISHA: Okay, ready, one, two,

493
00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.210
three.
TRAVIS: Don't touch it, don't touch!

494
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.050
MARISHA: Okay.

495
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.350
LIAM: Did you feel the stone?

496
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.183
TRAVIS: The what?

497
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.940
LAURA: The what?

498
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.940
TALIESIN: The stone.

499
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.540
I can't talk right now.
TRAVIS: Oh, the orb?

500
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.373
SAM: The ball.

501
00:20:12.373 --> 00:20:14.320
LIAM: What else are they here for?

502
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.220
TRAVIS: It has to be that,

503
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.480
I didn't know I still had it.

504
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.600
I can't feel it now.

505
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.440
I don't I don't know where it is.

506
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.660
I thought it was <i>in</i> the sword, I thought it was--

507
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.210
MATT: You hear this strange guttural impact,

508
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.170
a resonance that sounds familiar to you.

509
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.568
It's the arrival of a Dimension Door spell.

510
00:20:32.568 --> 00:20:33.950
SAM and LAURA: Oh.

511
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:34.850
MATT: Immediately you hear

512
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.370
a brief incantation beneath someone's breath

513
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.820
a little ways away, the storm swirling entirely,

514
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.653
but Caduceus, you're in the middle

515
00:20:41.653 --> 00:20:43.820
of chanting and it picks up.

516
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.945
I need

517
00:20:45.945 --> 00:20:49.978
Beauregard, Caleb, Veth.

518
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.888
Yeah, I need all six of you to roll wisdom saving throws.

519
00:20:55.888 --> 00:20:57.390
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.
MATT: All but Fjord.

520
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.973
LAURA: And me too?

521
00:20:58.973 --> 00:20:59.849
MATT: Yep.

522
00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:01.160
TRAVIS: Can I make a reaction?

523
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.080
MARISHA: Oh god, natural one.

524
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.190
MATT: What kind of reaction are you making?

525
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.230
SAM: That's a natural one.
TRAVIS: Cast a spell.

526
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.477
MATT: Is it a reaction spell?

527
00:21:08.477 --> 00:21:09.310
TRAVIS: No.

528
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.800
MATT: Then no, you can not.
TRAVIS: Okay.

529
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.790
TALIESIN: Wisdom saving spell?

530
00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.800
MATT: Saving throw, yeah.

531
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.580
ASHLEY: Two.
MATT: Hmm!

532
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.250
TALIESIN: 25.
MATT: Okay.

533
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.000
LAURA: 11.
MATT: Okay.

534
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.530
SAM: Natural one.
MATT: Okay.

535
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.210
MARISHA: Natural one.
MATT: Okay.

536
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.620
LIAM: 22.

537
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.650
MATT: All right.

538
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.920
Caduceus and Caleb, you feel this influence try

539
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.110
and climb within your body

540
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:35.110
and you manage to shove it away, while Beauregard,

541
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.770
Veth--
MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

542
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.890
MATT: -- Jester, and Yasha.

543
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.630
Your bodies immediately lock up,

544
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.550
and you find yourself unable to move, your muscles frozen

545
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.000
in space by some of arcane influence.

546
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.850
LIAM: Do I see anyone from the Cerberus
zooming in on the boat?

547
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.220
MATT: You turn around and
on the deck you see, freshly arrived,

548
00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.590
a half-elven woman, with short, brown hair standing there,

549
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.007
long robes flowing in the wind, hand out.

550
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.930
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, hello, identify yourself, please.

551
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.205
MATT: "(French accent) I would like you
to identify yourself first.

552
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.240
"Get away from the wounded one."

553
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.590
LIAM: We are The Mighty Nein, he's one of us.

554
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.820
TALIESIN: Just had a lot happen here
in a very short amount of time.

555
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.871
MATT: "Very well." The paralysis fades.

556
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:27.950
SAM and LAURA: (exhaling)

557
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.240
MATT: You can hear now other bells are ringing

558
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.990
and you can see, off in the distance, other ships

559
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.060
that have slowly began making their way in your direction.

560
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.628
TRAVIS: Oh, I was wondering if anyone noticed.

561
00:22:35.628 --> 00:22:37.444
Oh, fuck.

562
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.980
MATT: "My apologies, I am
"just taking the necessary precautions."

563
00:22:45.078 --> 00:22:47.254
LIAM: Is she dressed like a volstrucker?

564
00:22:47.254 --> 00:22:49.723
MATT: No. Very fine robes.

565
00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:53.262
You've seen her once before from a distance in Felderwin.

566
00:22:53.262 --> 00:22:55.587
LIAM: Oh.
MATT: This is Lady Vess DeRogna.

567
00:22:55.587 --> 00:22:56.752
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

568
00:22:56.752 --> 00:22:59.085
MATT: The Archmage of Antiquity.

569
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.910
MATT: "Well, I assume then, based on your

570
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.780
"confusion at my arrival that you are not responsible

571
00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.310
"for the wounded on this deck?

572
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.250
"Please tell me immediately

573
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.310
"what has transpired in the past minute?"

574
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.890
LIAM: The boat came under attack.

575
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.410
TRAVIS: Yes, please keep telling the story.

576
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.590
I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself

577
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.490
at 5th-level, if you don't mind.

578
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.178
TALIESIN: Anyone have Minor Illusion or something?

579
00:23:25.178 --> 00:23:26.061
LAURA: No.

580
00:23:26.061 --> 00:23:27.140
TRAVIS: 5d8 plus--

581
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.710
LIAM: Some sort of creatures
out of the sea swarmed the ship.

582
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:36.200
TALIESIN: Did any of the swords
ping when I cast Detect Magic?

583
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.033
MATT: No.

584
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:44.380
LAURA: Can we just describe to her
what that people looked like? The (hissing).

585
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.921
SAM: Oh, okay. Sure, I'll cast Silent Image

586
00:23:47.921 --> 00:23:50.630
and make an image of what one of them look like.

587
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.230
MATT: You do find the sword that

588
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.910
the leader of them seem to be holding.

589
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.270
It is currently just a regular weapon.

590
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.050
It has lost any sort of visual representation

591
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.910
of the Sword of Fathoms that it used to have.

592
00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.620
LAURA: Could we, during the fight did any of us notice--

593
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.110
I mean- obviously Caduceus did,

594
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.601
but did we notice

595
00:24:06.601 --> 00:24:10.309
that they look like swords old Fjord-- Fjord's old sword?

596
00:24:11.212 --> 00:24:13.020
TALIESIN: Fjord's old sword?

597
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.510
MATT: I would say Beauregard would have noticed, probably.

598
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.420
The people that were fought most of the time on the deck,

599
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.210
Caleb as well, actually, you would have noticed.

600
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.170
Because you guys were closest

601
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.400
and with the most immediate visible range

602
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.983
until the very end.

603
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.480
Jester, your passive perception isn't bad.

604
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.790
I'd say you probably noticed it, too,

605
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.280
before the the moment where Yasha ended up

606
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.290
snapping its neck and throwing the corpse overboard.

607
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.135
The corpse is still hanging on
the edge of the boat, by the way.

608
00:24:36.135 --> 00:24:38.964
LAURA: Oh, well there,
that's what they look like right there.

609
00:24:38.964 --> 00:24:40.050
ASHLEY: I'll pull it back up.

610
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.895
TRAVIS: 38 points of healing from the Cure Wounds.

611
00:24:42.895 --> 00:24:44.530
MATT: Not bad for a new paladin.

612
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.860
LIAM: Did you say she was all alone, or with other people?

613
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.693
MATT: Alone currently.
LIAM: Okay.

614
00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:52.403
LAURA: You should learn it, that's useful.

615
00:24:52.403 --> 00:24:53.236
SAM: I will.

616
00:24:53.236 --> 00:24:54.900
MATT: "So these creatures you point out

617
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.500
"responsible for this attack.

618
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.840
"Could you please tell me if you have any inclination

619
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.492
"as to why?"

620
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.878
SAM: Seemed random, random attack.

621
00:25:05.878 --> 00:25:09.390
This is a fearsome vessel that we command--

622
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.723
LAURA: Yeah, that's true. I mean, we were, you know--
SAM: Pirates.

623
00:25:11.723 --> 00:25:13.630
LAURA: -- pretty famous pirates on the sea

624
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.280
so maybe that they just recognized our flag and--

625
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.350
MARISHA: I have a feeling it has
something to do with the location

626
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.310
that we're at currently in the ocean, as well.

627
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.415
We might be over their domain.

628
00:25:25.415 --> 00:25:26.498
MATT: I will say,

629
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.620
go ahead and make a deception check,

630
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.700
Veth, with advantage because they did help you.

631
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.564
SAM: Oh, natural 20.

632
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.866
Minus two.

633
00:25:38.866 --> 00:25:41.128
(laughter)

634
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.779
MATT: Vess gives you a look and goes,

635
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.530
"Very well. These are dangerous waters, the closer

636
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.880
"we get to the reef itself.

637
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.850
"We were prepared for such a thing.

638
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.950
"Well, I'm glad that you apparently are safe.

639
00:26:02.095 --> 00:26:04.032
"The Mighty Nein, correct?"

640
00:26:04.032 --> 00:26:05.735
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yes.

641
00:26:05.735 --> 00:26:06.770
LAURA: <i>Oui!</i>

642
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.273
MATT: "I have been made aware of who you are.

643
00:26:11.273 --> 00:26:13.993
"The Martinet speaks highly of the aid

644
00:26:13.993 --> 00:26:17.651
"that you provided back in Rexxentrum."

645
00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.900
LIAM: Are you traveling with the Martinet

646
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.999
or are you on your own ship here?

647
00:26:22.999 --> 00:26:25.699
MATT: "I am traveling where I please,

648
00:26:25.699 --> 00:26:27.812
"but I'm here on the same mission.

649
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.760
"But nevertheless,

650
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.993
"we appreciate your contributions to ending this conflict.

651
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.490
"This is unfortunate that you have been pulled

652
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:42.490
"into whatever entities wish to see it not come to fruition,

653
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.300
"but glad you're all safe."

654
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.420
At which point, Orly limps up behind and goes,

655
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.420
"We appreciate your appreciation."

656
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.448
(thudding footsteps)

657
00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.281
She's like--

658
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:04.730
"Anyway, I'll leave you to your recovery.

659
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.398
"If you require anything,

660
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.440
"if any of you have the means of reaching out, I'm not far.

661
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.760
"And when all of this is over,

662
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.210
"if you're looking for work, there maybe some possibilities

663
00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.300
"in the north, should we work together."

664
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.790
LIAM: I drop in to Zemnian.

665
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.870
(American accent) We greatly appreciate your aid out here.

666
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.690
And it's nice to know that we can count

667
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.375
on each other in this difficult moment.

668
00:27:36.375 --> 00:27:38.741
MATT: She leans in and responds in Zemnian,

669
00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:40.560
(American accent) "Of course.

670
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.680
"And it's this forthrightness

671
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.040
"that lets us know who our friends are

672
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.574
"in times of confused politics."

673
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.200
LIAM: Good way of putting it.

674
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.420
MATT: "Hmm."
LIAM: But

675
00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.420
we all want an end to pain and suffering

676
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.200
as much as is possible.

677
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.925
MATT: "As much as possible.

678
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.130
"(original accent) But anyway,

679
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.060
"hopefully there's still time to get some sleep.

680
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:13.893
"And myself,

681
00:28:13.893 --> 00:28:17.720
"I'm a bit frustrated that the
storm made it difficult enough

682
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.995
"to bed down and I'm a bit winded.

683
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.110
LIAM: Hopefully we can talk about the north on a different day.

684
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.480
MATT: "(American accent) There's plenty of time on the sea.

685
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.010
"You'll know how to find me, I'm sure."

686
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.320
LIAM: Very much so.

687
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.710
MATT: "(original accent) Sleep well.

688
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.718
"<i>Gute nacht.</i>"

689
00:28:37.718 --> 00:28:40.710
And then the Dimension Doors away.

690
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.040
The other ships ding, ding, ding,

691
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.210
other bells start going off.

692
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.145
MARISHA: Fucking bitch.

693
00:28:46.145 --> 00:28:47.610
SAM: She seems nice.
LAURA: Were you hitting on her?

694
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.607
Were you hitting on her?

695
00:28:49.607 --> 00:28:51.867
LIAM: (original accent) Do you think that
would have been useful?

696
00:28:51.867 --> 00:28:53.675
LAURA: It could've been, I'm not sure.

697
00:28:53.675 --> 00:28:55.059
It's like you were talking to her and of a sudden

698
00:28:55.059 --> 00:28:57.143
she starts talking about bedding down.

699
00:28:57.143 --> 00:28:58.380
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at this.

700
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.384
ASHLEY: The body I was holding, is still.

701
00:29:00.384 --> 00:29:01.842
I'm going to put this back in the side.

702
00:29:01.842 --> 00:29:04.360
TALIESIN: No, no, I needed that.

703
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.410
SAM: Fjord, do you recognize these creatures?

704
00:29:08.168 --> 00:29:11.400
TRAVIS: I don't think so. Do I recognize these creatures?

705
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.550
MATT: Here's the odd thing.

706
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.070
In the brief moments that it's been dead,

707
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.280
like when you've noticed is this very humanoid creature

708
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.490
with, like, a dull gray, blue skin,

709
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.090
these yellowish eyes, very reminiscent of the entity

710
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.110
of which you were once bound to.

711
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.710
As opposed to hair, it has these long,

712
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.870
rubbery tendrils that emerge

713
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.560
from the back of its head that are long,

714
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.570
like it has a set of

715
00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.870
thick tentacles that protrude from the back of the head.

716
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.460
Its jaw seems to open on both sides,

717
00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.230
there's a smaller mouth surrounded in teeth

718
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.510
and whereas these additional sides

719
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.350
open up as part of its screech,

720
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:51.350
claws, fin-like protrusions from the forearms

721
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.850
and the knees.

722
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:53.930
But as you guys are inspecting it,

723
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:58.896
its form begins to slowly shift and change

724
00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:01.362
into that of

725
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:07.296
a 40 something, scruffy-chinned,

726
00:30:07.296 --> 00:30:11.948
slightly balding man, a fisherman.

727
00:30:11.948 --> 00:30:14.155
LAURA: What the heck.

728
00:30:14.155 --> 00:30:16.503
SAM: Do you recognize that dude?
TRAVIS: What?

729
00:30:16.503 --> 00:30:18.438
LIAM: What happens to the jaw?

730
00:30:18.438 --> 00:30:19.820
Does it remain in pieces?

731
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.950
Or does it--
MATT: No,

732
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.730
it reverts and seals back to

733
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.030
a normal human--
LAURA: Whoa.

734
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.230
Fjord, do you know this guy?

735
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.040
TRAVIS: I don't think so.

736
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.500
MATT: No sense of recognition.

737
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.116
LAURA: Oh my gosh, if you would have kept doing--

738
00:30:33.116 --> 00:30:35.880
MARISHA: Yeah, would you look like that? Yeah!

739
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.970
SAM: If you had kept--

740
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.053
LAURA: You'd turn into--
MARISHA: To tentacle man?!

741
00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:43.080
TRAVIS: I don't know,

742
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.770
I can't imagine that's a reward.

743
00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:46.802
But it might be.

744
00:30:46.802 --> 00:30:50.240
ASHLEY: Do you think he has
one of those things in his chest?

745
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.810
LIAM: Caleb starts inspecting the body

746
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.007
and feeling for a seam in the jaw just

747
00:30:55.007 --> 00:30:56.040
to work on the cadaver.

748
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.290
MATT: There are two other bodies

749
00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.900
of a similar type creature on board,

750
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.660
though not quite as prominent

751
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.440
in, it seems, the hierarchy upon their arrival.

752
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.310
They, too, have reverted to a normal form,

753
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.360
one of which appears to be elven.

754
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.752
One, looks to be,

755
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.850
a, best you could say

756
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.480
is a goliath, in a half giant body.

757
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.570
The elf being female,

758
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.287
and they're both,

759
00:31:22.287 --> 00:31:24.100
they're a little gaunt, little sallow.

760
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.650
TRAVIS: Female goliath?

761
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.720
MATT: No, female elf and a male goliath.

762
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.300
The gender was difficult to discern in the creature form

763
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.935
in which you battled them.

764
00:31:32.935 --> 00:31:35.518
TALIESIN: Beau, do you want to search through the pockets?

765
00:31:35.518 --> 00:31:37.185
See if there's--

766
00:31:37.185 --> 00:31:39.190
MARISHA: Yeah, you have a knife? Who's got a knife?

767
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.802
SAM: I got a knife.
LAURA: I got an axe.

768
00:31:41.802 --> 00:31:42.740
Do you want--
SAM: Here's an old rusty dagger.

769
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.210
LAURA: Should we open them up
and see if there's, like, orbs inside?

770
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.651
LIAM: I was-- We're all on the same page.
TALIESIN: Keep the heads--

771
00:31:49.651 --> 00:31:51.770
LAURA: I'm going to help; I'm really good at this stuff.

772
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:52.874
MARISHA: All right.

773
00:31:52.874 --> 00:31:53.707
MATT: What are you doing?

774
00:31:53.707 --> 00:31:58.040
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to search for,
like, a worm in the body.

775
00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.706
MATT: Okay, roll medicine check.
SAM: You want a blade,

776
00:31:59.706 --> 00:32:01.190
or you going to use your axe?

777
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.270
LAURA: Well, you got a blade there.

778
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:07.390
MARISHA: I'll fillet back the skin a bit and hold it

779
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.340
kind of--
LAURA: I mean, I've only--

780
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.550
TRAVIS: I thought you said you're really good at this?

781
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:14.550
LAURA: I am, but this is really gross every time. (vomiting)

782
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.750
LIAM: Just grab it like a book and open it real fast.

783
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.760
MARISHA: I already opened it for her.

784
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.780
Just got to really--
LAURA: Okay, okay, I'm just going to--

785
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.490
LAURA: I'm just going to reach it up and look for a hard orb

786
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:25.630
or something.

787
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.460
Ooh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

788
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.425
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you got?

789
00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:32.097
Anything?
LAURA: Let me check.

790
00:32:32.097 --> 00:32:32.930
MATT: Make a medicine check.

791
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.823
TRAVIS: Describe the spell.

792
00:32:34.823 --> 00:32:37.120
LAURA: Do I get advantage because everyone is helping me?

793
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.620
TALIESIN: I'm giving you a d4.

794
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.870
MARISHA: Does she get advantage
because I'm there, like, helping

795
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.409
you know, pry back ribs and sternum and shit?

796
00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:45.242
MATT: Sure.

797
00:32:45.242 --> 00:32:46.944
MARISHA: Yeah.

798
00:32:46.944 --> 00:32:48.323
SAM: Is that triple advantage?

799
00:32:48.323 --> 00:32:49.425
TRAVIS: Sure, sure.

800
00:32:49.425 --> 00:32:52.675
LAURA: Oh, I'm just rolling the four the same time.

801
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.340
25.

802
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.450
MATT: 25. First, as it opens and you dig in,

803
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.830
it's a unique smell, in the sense that

804
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.230
the interior of a human body

805
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.640
has a not pleasant scent.
LAURA: This is really fucked up.

806
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.307
MATT: But this is briny.

807
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.270
All the organs seem in order for a human body.

808
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:18.853
Though everything has a slightly dull grayish blue tint

809
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.750
similar to the coloration of the skin

810
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.393
of the creature's form that you first encountered
LAURA: Does that mean they've

811
00:33:23.393 --> 00:33:25.050
been dead for a long time something?

812
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:28.752
MATT: Or there's some sort of transition that has happened

813
00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:34.430
that has left their organs just miscolored

814
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.680
and the scent adjusted accordingly.

815
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.213
After spending a few moments

816
00:33:38.213 --> 00:33:42.563
giving a thorough, jolly search--

817
00:33:43.763 --> 00:33:45.790
TRAVIS: Great forearm pocket.

818
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.680
MATT: -- does not seem to be anything else in there

819
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.184
that wasn't originally intended.

820
00:33:50.184 --> 00:33:52.101
(laughter)
LIAM: Aliens 3.

821
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:54.023
SAM: Maybe you should check the other two, just in case.

822
00:33:54.023 --> 00:33:54.856
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: No, I don't.

823
00:33:54.856 --> 00:33:56.640
LAURA: It's just organs, I have a feeling Fjord

824
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.650
would not have turned into one of these things.

825
00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.850
I feel like they were, like, a servant in a different way.

826
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.683
Do you know what they mean?

827
00:34:02.683 --> 00:34:03.730
MARISHA: Maybe Fjord could have

828
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:04.890
controlled them if he were to kept going.

829
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:07.590
ASHLEY: The thing is if, they were probably

830
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.890
trying to get it out of you.

831
00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:11.190
So maybe they, none of them have one.

832
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.285
MARISHA: But it was the big guy.

833
00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:15.530
They were like the bigger guys who

834
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.800
definitely seemed to be calling the shots

835
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.110
and running the show.

836
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.920
TALIESIN: We have one of the big, we have the big one here.

837
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.940
MATT: Which one?

838
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.593
TALIESIN: The main one.

839
00:34:24.593 --> 00:34:26.926
LAURA: That is what, I was just, I was just, yeah.

840
00:34:26.926 --> 00:34:28.880
LIAM: It might be a little presumptuous of us

841
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.880
to try to understand the hierarchy of Uk'otoa's minions.

842
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.610
TRAVIS: We had falchions.

843
00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.120
We had the same sort of curved blade

844
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.778
that I didn't see

845
00:34:41.778 --> 00:34:44.060
an eye or orb in the sword though, right?

846
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.750
MATT: No, it was just a similar

847
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.770
shape, same barnacled growths on them

848
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.940
similar perpetually wet,

849
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.680
oceanic essence to it.

850
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.360
TRAVIS: I've spent enough time with it
and it was the same sword.

851
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.850
MARISHA: Even the swords have reverted back.

852
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.150
LAURA: Should we search for an orb in you, Fjord?

853
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.100
I mean, not like that, but should we?

854
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.390
Do you have one inside of you still?

855
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.020
TRAVIS: All evidence seems to suggest yes.

856
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.340
LAURA: How do we get it out?

857
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.850
TRAVIS: I don't, I don't know!
SAM: How did you get it in?

858
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:17.683
TRAVIS: I...

859
00:35:20.383 --> 00:35:21.440
MARISHA: Do we have to go back to that temple?

860
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.730
Do you have to give it back?

861
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.440
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

862
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.115
TALIESIN: I don't know if you can.

863
00:35:26.115 --> 00:35:27.365
LAURA: What if-- no.

864
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.380
TRAVIS: I mean (mumbling).

865
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.480
LAURA: What if, what if we blink into the Ethereal Plane?

866
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.170
Do you think we would see it in the Ethereal Plane?

867
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.830
TRAVIS: What do you mean, like, in me or outside of me?

868
00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.340
TALIESIN: I mean, you would have, probably-- I don't know.

869
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.640
MARISHA: It's true, I've seen something with True Sight.

870
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.590
Do I remember back to the party

871
00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.646
if I saw something in Fjord with True Sight?

872
00:35:51.646 --> 00:35:53.896
MATT: Not in that instance, no.

873
00:35:56.316 --> 00:36:00.260
TRAVIS: I had a dream where I'm ingested a sword.

874
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.343
I could try and throw up?

875
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.480
There was another one where I just,

876
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.342
I pushed it into my chest.

877
00:36:06.342 --> 00:36:08.300
LAURA: You have two orbs in you still?!

878
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.254
TRAVIS: No, no, I'm just saying I consumed--

879
00:36:10.254 --> 00:36:11.593
LAURA: Do you have two orbs in you?

880
00:36:11.593 --> 00:36:13.360
No, no I only have--
LAURA: How do you know?

881
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.790
TRAVIS: Because I opened the key to one of the locks

882
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.057
of Uk'otoa with the sword.

883
00:36:18.057 --> 00:36:19.140
SAM: How did you get it open?

884
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.090
Did you pull it out?

885
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.410
TRAVIS: There were two eyes in the sword,

886
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:22.840
that I placed it down into the ground

887
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.860
but I had to use the pommel of the sword--

888
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.190
MATT: There are two that you've placed actually.

889
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.210
TRAVIS: Two that I've--

890
00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.380
LAURA: So you have two orbs inside of you!

891
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.914
You have two orbs inside of you!

892
00:36:31.914 --> 00:36:33.910
MATT: No, you've placed two orbs,

893
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:36.459
there was a one at Urukayxl.
TRAVIS: Avantika placed one.

894
00:36:36.459 --> 00:36:37.600
I placed one from the pommel.

895
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.274
MATT: Correct, sorry, there were
two that have been placed, yes.

896
00:36:40.274 --> 00:36:42.990
MARISHA: Yeah, because the third one
unleashes the gates, right?

897
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.360
TRAVIS: Right, I was holding the last key.

898
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.860
SAM: Does your sword, falchion whatever right now

899
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.140
have an eye on it?

900
00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.100
TRAVIS: It did when I threw it in the pool of magma.

901
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.933
MARISHA: Wait.

902
00:36:52.933 --> 00:36:55.700
SAM: But your current sword does not.

903
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.700
TRAVIS: (whooshing) No eye!

904
00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.770
Right, no eye, no eye, no eye, no eye?

905
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:00.603
MATT: No eye.

906
00:37:00.603 --> 00:37:01.436
MARISHA: Can you try and make it a thing?

907
00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:03.390
Can you try and make it have an eyeball?

908
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.330
TALIESIN: I don't--
LAURA: Why would you do that?

909
00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:05.459
That's the Wildmother's sword.

910
00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:07.140
TALIESIN: -- think that's how that works.

911
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.760
TRAVIS: If we get it then we just toss that bitch

912
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.530
in the ocean and keep going, it'd be fun.

913
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.661
Make me an eye.

914
00:37:13.661 --> 00:37:14.661
LAURA: No, Fjord.

915
00:37:14.661 --> 00:37:15.494
MATT: Nothing happens.

916
00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:17.160
TRAVIS: No, it doesn't work.

917
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.780
SAM: But how do you get this orb out of you?

918
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.900
MARISHA: It seems like--
SAM: Should we slice him open?

919
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.190
LIAM: Jester, you've been able to find things.

920
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.130
Would you be able to--
LAURA: Like locate an object?

921
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.400
I mean, I could if I--
SAM: Have you seen?

922
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.142
LAURA: If I sleep on it, you know what I mean?

923
00:37:33.142 --> 00:37:34.767
I got to sleep on. I got to think about that.

924
00:37:34.767 --> 00:37:36.026
LIAM: I feel you.
LAURA: Yeah.

925
00:37:36.026 --> 00:37:37.700
TRAVIS: Beau, Yasha.

926
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.960
You can, like, divine aspects or whatever.

927
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.760
If I lift my arms can you, like, push around

928
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.125
in my guts and my rib cage to see if there's any--

929
00:37:45.125 --> 00:37:47.099
Like feel if there's a tangerine in that bitch.

930
00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:49.180
MARISHA: Can I try and basically, like,

931
00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.990
hit some pressure points.

932
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.380
TALIESIN: If we're doing this, I cast

933
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.720
Locate Object level three--
LAURA: Oh, you have it already

934
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.430
fucking prepared? Well, good for you!

935
00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:00.110
MATT: Okay. And you are?

936
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.185
TALIESIN: Trying to find the the orb.

937
00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.760
MATT: Okay, you can sense that there is

938
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.620
something of the essence that you're seeking for

939
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.573
within Fjord's body.

940
00:38:12.573 --> 00:38:13.473
Though--

941
00:38:13.473 --> 00:38:15.500
TALIESIN: It doesn't feel like an orb, does it?

942
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.510
MATT: I mean, it resembles an orb, but it's--

943
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:24.443
it's there, that's as much as you can make out--

944
00:38:24.443 --> 00:38:27.560
LAURA: It's not, like, "Ooh it's definitely in the thigh."

945
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.060
MATT: Right.
TRAVIS: When that thing

946
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.280
was in my chest before I decided to take, you know,

947
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.345
just a quick repose.

948
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.600
Was he, like, doing the same thing that we were just doing?

949
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.340
Was he trying to grab something

950
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.540
out of my chest or?
LAURA: He was, like, hacking--

951
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.800
ASHLEY: He was hacking into your chest with a sword.

952
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.900
MARISHA: Felt very centralized.
TRAVIS: So it's not <i>me</i>

953
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.314
that he wanted; he wanted something out of me.

954
00:38:50.314 --> 00:38:52.040
LAURA: I don't know, he also was trying to pull you

955
00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.440
down into the ocean so--

956
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.950
SAM: They really wanted to kill you.

957
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.080
TRAVIS: Wait, they were trying to take me off the boat?

958
00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.980
MARISHA: I think he was trying to take you off the boat.

959
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.760
After they knew that most of the team

960
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.720
had been compromised.

961
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.970
LIAM: Yeah, we weren't giving him time to do

962
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.836
his work, and so he needed to leave with your corpse.

963
00:39:07.836 --> 00:39:09.930
LAURA: Or they just really--

964
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:13.080
TALIESIN: Or they had to take you somewhere dead or alive.

965
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.420
MARISHA: He seemed very much like

966
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.000
he knew what he was doing

967
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.190
and what he was going for in his chest.

968
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.490
I think he ran--

969
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.860
TRAVIS: So maybe if I die, something happens.

970
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.190
TALIESIN: Or maybe it doesn't matter.

971
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.780
ASHLEY: So you, you had a dream

972
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.770
that you swallowed this orb and the orb is there?

973
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.220
LAURA: Open your mouth.

974
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.053
TRAVIS: Yes.

975
00:39:34.053 --> 00:39:35.863
Ah.

976
00:39:35.863 --> 00:39:37.586
LAURA: Do I see anything in his throat?

977
00:39:37.586 --> 00:39:38.670
MATT: Make a perception check.

978
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.205
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Are his tonsil swollen?

979
00:39:40.205 --> 00:39:41.288
TRAVIS: Strep.

980
00:39:41.288 --> 00:39:43.621
(chuckling)

981
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.650
LAURA: 20, what is it, 24.

982
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.677
MATT: 24?
LAURA: No, did I add that right?

983
00:39:50.677 --> 00:39:52.110
Yeah, no, 22.

984
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.027
MATT: 22, okay.

985
00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.734
Mild discoloration around the tonsils.

986
00:39:56.734 --> 00:39:58.269
TRAVIS: I am--!

987
00:39:58.269 --> 00:39:59.102
(laughter)

988
00:39:59.102 --> 00:40:01.357
I gargle with sea water every night!

989
00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:02.357
TALIESIN: Throw him overboard.

990
00:40:02.357 --> 00:40:06.000
MATT: Actually fairly healthy, but no orb.

991
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.662
LAURA: Don't see anything--
SAM: You've got mono.

992
00:40:08.662 --> 00:40:09.495
LAURA: I don't see anything.

993
00:40:09.495 --> 00:40:11.710
MARISHA: Well look, I mean,

994
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:15.297
you had wet dreams for months about

995
00:40:15.297 --> 00:40:16.540
trying to--
TRAVIS: Not

996
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.580
quite as that makes that it sound.

997
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.788
MARISHA: Get Uk'otoa free.

998
00:40:19.788 --> 00:40:20.820
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

999
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.520
MARISHA: We know very clearly what Uk'otoa's mission is

1000
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.582
and I'm assuming--
SAM and LIAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

1001
00:40:24.582 --> 00:40:26.188
LAURA: Maybe it's bad, maybe it's like Beetlejuice,

1002
00:40:26.188 --> 00:40:27.820
if you say his name three times in a row,

1003
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.528
it's really bad then they'll show up on the boat.

1004
00:40:29.528 --> 00:40:31.290
LIAM: What is Beetlejuice?
LAURA: The ship.

1005
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:32.975
You know, like Candy Man.

1006
00:40:32.975 --> 00:40:34.844
TRAVIS: Is that a drink?

1007
00:40:34.844 --> 00:40:36.250
TALIESIN: It's not helpful. I don't know what Candy.

1008
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.560
LIAM: Is that the Traveler?

1009
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.890
MARISHA: Like the Blair Witch.

1010
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.348
LIAM: What is Blair Witch?

1011
00:40:40.348 --> 00:40:42.600
(laughter)

1012
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.141
TRAVIS: I don't know how to get this out,

1013
00:40:46.141 --> 00:40:47.620
but I think it's fair to assume.

1014
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.150
How is the ship, by the way?

1015
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.220
LAURA: Not too bad.
SAM: Below decks is a little

1016
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.053
tored up.

1017
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.800
TRAVIS: A little to'ed up from the flo' up?

1018
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.700
MATT: Gallan at this point arrives the deck and goes like,

1019
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.050
"Whoa! Everything okay?"

1020
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.580
TALIESIN: I mean--
TRAVIS: Yeah, just fine, you know.

1021
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.876
Spilled a bit of wine.

1022
00:41:08.876 --> 00:41:10.598
MATT: "Should I start getting the repairs?"

1023
00:41:10.598 --> 00:41:13.290
LAURA, MARISHA, and SAM: Yes.
MATT: "Okay."

1024
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.230
SAM: Start with the cannons.

1025
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.572
LAURA: You know what? Oh, I have an idea.

1026
00:41:16.572 --> 00:41:19.000
What if I send a message to Essek?

1027
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.083
SAM: To say what?

1028
00:41:20.083 --> 00:41:22.085
LAURA: To say come over here and help us get this

1029
00:41:22.085 --> 00:41:23.070
orb out of Fjord.

1030
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:24.270
TALIESIN: I think that would be--

1031
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.370
let's wait.
LAURA: Why?

1032
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.050
TALIESIN: Just there's too much happening all at once.

1033
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:33.550
This feels like so many moving parts.

1034
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.550
LIAM: I think my only question.

1035
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:36.383
Not my only question.

1036
00:41:36.383 --> 00:41:39.470
One of many questions is, were these creatures

1037
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.637
that came for you, was one of them or all of them,

1038
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.860
actors or operators like you yourself

1039
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.880
were at one time or like Avantika was?

1040
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.689
Or are they just sent by, you know?

1041
00:41:55.689 --> 00:41:59.120
TRAVIS: I don't recognize the goliath
or the female elf, correct?

1042
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.220
MATT: No, upon inspecting their corpses,
these are all just--

1043
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.820
TRAVIS: My question is, and I don't know if

1044
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.653
there's an answer to this.

1045
00:42:03.653 --> 00:42:05.960
Is there a way to determine if a body is cursed?

1046
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.600
After death or during life?

1047
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.433
I just don't--

1048
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.513
MARISHA: You want me to try

1049
00:42:12.513 --> 00:42:13.672
the pressure points thing?
LAURA: Greater restoration

1050
00:42:13.672 --> 00:42:14.630
cures curses.

1051
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.140
TALIESIN: Well, yeah, I don't know if it detects curses.

1052
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.973
Detect Good and Evil, maybe?

1053
00:42:17.973 --> 00:42:21.544
LAURA: Detect Good and Evil.
I don't think I have it prepared.

1054
00:42:21.544 --> 00:42:22.534
TALIESIN: No, I don't have that prepared.

1055
00:42:22.534 --> 00:42:23.367
Well maybe I do. No, I don't.

1056
00:42:23.367 --> 00:42:27.567
MARISHA: You know it's a service that I offer.

1057
00:42:27.567 --> 00:42:31.024
TALIESIN: I've burned every spell I have at this point.

1058
00:42:31.024 --> 00:42:34.650
SAM: I'm going to go investigate just the other dead bodies.

1059
00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:36.717
There is some down below deck, right?

1060
00:42:36.717 --> 00:42:37.550
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1061
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.550
SAM: I'll just go around and collect stuff.

1062
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.800
LAURA: I'm going to feel Fjord's chest.
TRAVIS: It's such an extreme transformation.

1063
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.380
LAURA: And, like, this area.

1064
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.490
SAM: The abs area or the pecs end?

1065
00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.280
LAURA: No, like, that abs you know, like

1066
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.340
the solar plexus.
MATT: Sternum?

1067
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.900
SAM: Maybe you should get all up and down.

1068
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.750
LAURA: I'm really going to really, like, tickle him.

1069
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.367
You know what I mean? I need to feel

1070
00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.800
to see if I can feel anything.

1071
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.630
Do you mind, is this okay?

1072
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.990
I just, I want to see if I feel an orb.

1073
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.823
TRAVIS: I was just dead.

1074
00:43:04.823 --> 00:43:06.031
So have at it.

1075
00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:07.572
LAURA: No, I mean,

1076
00:43:07.572 --> 00:43:09.870
if this is uncomfortable for you, let me know.

1077
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:10.703
TRAVIS: I'm actually enjoying it,

1078
00:43:10.703 --> 00:43:12.380
it's fine.
LAURA: Okay.

1079
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.905
MATT: Roll a medicine check.

1080
00:43:13.905 --> 00:43:15.639
LIAM: Bing!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1081
00:43:16.967 --> 00:43:18.567
(gagging)

1082
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.180
LAURA: 18.
MATT: 18.

1083
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:25.260
LAURA: I didn't get a Guidance-- Guidance! Too late.

1084
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.120
MATT: It seems sound, you don't feel any odd

1085
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.260
hardness?
MATT: Hardness.

1086
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.010
The other bodies that are around

1087
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:38.350
the sea spawn in particular.

1088
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:41.980
The lesser, strange, aquatic fish,

1089
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.400
mutated creatures did not.

1090
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.230
Yeah, they did not revert to their form

1091
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.840
they are still their mutated,

1092
00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.270
torn asunder selves based

1093
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.410
on their various means of being destroyed.

1094
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:58.180
Only the three elevated entities that you battled,

1095
00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.240
the ones that returned to some of natural humanoid body.

1096
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.030
TRAVIS: Can't you speak with dead things?

1097
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:04.597
TALIESIN: I can, tomorrow.

1098
00:44:04.597 --> 00:44:05.430
TRAVIS: Okay.

1099
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.700
We should try to, if we can. It might provide some answers.

1100
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.230
Until then?

1101
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.670
TALIESIN: Think about what you want to know.

1102
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.646
TRAVIS: Well, I'm also a bit of a homing beacon.

1103
00:44:14.646 --> 00:44:18.460
I was sleeping in the captain's quarters like a dingle...

1104
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.193
bubarfed.

1105
00:44:20.193 --> 00:44:24.388
LAURA: You know what, we should all--

1106
00:44:24.388 --> 00:44:25.970
we should all sleep in the captain's quarters.

1107
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.540
TALIESIN: Together?

1108
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.490
MARISHA: Maybe you can string us up a little alarm, Caleb?

1109
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.830
LIAM: I think that we maybe need

1110
00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.910
to follow on old practices, even though we're on the ship.

1111
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.250
TRAVIS: If I could add to the protocol, perhaps,

1112
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.530
Caleb, about what time is it today?

1113
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.180
LIAM: Oh, it's exactly--
MATT: (laughs)

1114
00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.050
I'd say, at this point, it's around 2:30 in the morning.

1115
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.640
TRAVIS: Could you remind me?

1116
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.400
Oh god. At 2:30 in the morning every day,

1117
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.467
and I'll cast Underwater Breathing just on everyone,

1118
00:44:53.467 --> 00:44:56.300
just in case they don't just come for me or us.

1119
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.270
LAURA: We should do it at, like, 2:00am.

1120
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.903
LIAM: How long does that last about?

1121
00:44:59.903 --> 00:45:00.820
TRAVIS: 24 hours.

1122
00:45:01.774 --> 00:45:03.190
SAM: What about bed time every night?

1123
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.606
TALIESIN: Do it right before you go to bed.

1124
00:45:05.606 --> 00:45:06.523
TRAVIS: 24 hours.

1125
00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.150
TALIESIN: Right before bed?

1126
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.100
TRAVIS: Just in case they blow up the ship

1127
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.260
and then we're all in the water.

1128
00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.160
LAURA: Or Uk'otoa comes up and, like, tentacles around

1129
00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.592
the whole ship and, like, cracks it in half

1130
00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:23.102
and then brings it down into the ocean.
TRAVIS: Nope. It hasn't been

1131
00:45:23.102 --> 00:45:25.460
released yet, I don't think that's very--

1132
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.803
TALIESIN: The fact that you're walking around means
that's not going to happen.

1133
00:45:27.803 --> 00:45:29.750
TRAVIS: I mean, I don't think he's been released yet.

1134
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.580
I actually don't know.

1135
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.010
I just assumed with the sword being thrown in

1136
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:36.130
and the last key and the sword were destroyed,

1137
00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:37.430
but--
LAURA: Well, obviously not.

1138
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.630
TRAVIS: Fucking clearly.

1139
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.300
TALIESIN: I think they need <i>you</i> to release him.

1140
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.000
LIAM: Seems like a rumor that would spread pretty easily.

1141
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.130
If you were released.

1142
00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:45.963
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1143
00:45:45.963 --> 00:45:48.110
MARISHA: Uk'otoa's going to get what he wants

1144
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.590
whether you help them or not.

1145
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:50.423
TALIESIN: Well,

1146
00:45:51.955 --> 00:45:53.540
I don't know.

1147
00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.340
MARISHA: Is it worth taking a swim?

1148
00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.450
Seeing what we're parked on top of.

1149
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.234
LIAM: In the pouring rain? At 2:30 in the morning?

1150
00:46:00.234 --> 00:46:02.130
MARISHA: I don't know.
TRAVIS: It's also really cold.

1151
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.750
MATT: The two other ships have now closed in the check

1152
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:05.880
and other bells are ringing

1153
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.890
and Orly is interfacing with them,

1154
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.110
letting them know that things are--

1155
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.510
the danger has passed and a bit of shouting back

1156
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:14.880
and forth from ship to ship.

1157
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.940
You know, "Do you need aid?"

1158
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.579
TRAVIS: Nearing the Inkclaw Reef, right?

1159
00:46:19.579 --> 00:46:21.730
MATT: You guys are just north of Inkclaw Reef.

1160
00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.980
You have about, I'd say, with the weather as

1161
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.050
it is right now, between six and seven days

1162
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:29.430
if the storm continues. It might be less if it lights up.

1163
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.440
TRAVIS: I think the temple is inland.

1164
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.430
It's not out here, the last one.

1165
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:39.190
MATT: You believe, based on the visions you had, that it was

1166
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.190
north of Nicodranas.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1167
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.451
Like just west and south of the gate

1168
00:46:44.451 --> 00:46:45.909
entrance--
MATT: Yeah, the Wuyun Gorge, yeah.

1169
00:46:45.909 --> 00:46:48.720
LAURA: I just mean we're near the other temple, the one

1170
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.678
that you already opened.

1171
00:46:49.678 --> 00:46:51.150
MARISHA: Yeah.

1172
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.650
MATT: You are, you are just north of Urukayxl.

1173
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.490
LIAM: Sometimes, the two of you--
TRAVIS: I thought it was out here.

1174
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.653
MATT: No, no, the first one you went to, which is to

1175
00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:04.478
the lower right of the map.
LIAM: Inkling of things that we cannot understand.

1176
00:47:04.478 --> 00:47:05.690
LAURA: Commune.

1177
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.390
TALIESIN: That may be a thing to do tomorrow

1178
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.223
as well.
LAURA: Yeah, I will.

1179
00:47:08.223 --> 00:47:10.140
I can commune tonight, I can ask the Traveler

1180
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.555
if he knows anything, or if he can sense the orb in Fjord.

1181
00:47:13.555 --> 00:47:15.210
SAM: We know the orb's in Fjord.

1182
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.280
LAURA: Yeah, but if you could, like, find out where it is

1183
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.840
or, like, if he knows how to get it out,

1184
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.760
if he's heard about anything like this.

1185
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.360
I going to sit down, I'm going to Commune.

1186
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.790
I'm going to set up 10 minutes

1187
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:25.130
and I'm going to set up a ritual.

1188
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.920
TRAVIS: Actually could we join you

1189
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.400
and just see if the Wildmother might

1190
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.577
have anything to say about his orb?

1191
00:47:32.577 --> 00:47:33.670
Maybe just to meditate.

1192
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:35.710
LAURA: Do you have Commune?
LIAM: Caduceus

1193
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.600
has fought very hard for you when you are down.

1194
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.480
I don't know if he's feeling up to it.

1195
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.340
TALIESIN: I'll give it a try,

1196
00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.993
but I don't promise anything.

1197
00:47:43.993 --> 00:47:45.786
I'm a little little burnt.

1198
00:47:45.786 --> 00:47:47.070
MATT: Have you spent you this time focusing

1199
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:48.480
on casting the healing spell by the way?

1200
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.130
TALIESIN: I thought I got interrupted by it.

1201
00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.130
I assumed that, that paralyze will power roll

1202
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:54.600
just completely blew that.
MATT: You succeeded.

1203
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.433
TALIESIN: Oh, did I succeed?

1204
00:47:55.433 --> 00:47:58.140
MATT: Yeah, you succeeded so you manage to continue it.

1205
00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:58.973
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

1206
00:47:58.973 --> 00:48:01.560
Extra 21 hit points, then to, you, you,

1207
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.810
you, and then anybody else one, two, three, four.

1208
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.230
And then two crew members.

1209
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:10.043
LIAM: I'm at full, if anyone needs some more healing.

1210
00:48:10.043 --> 00:48:11.120
LAURA: Orly could probably use it.

1211
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.680
TALIESIN: Yeah, Orly--
MATT: Orly will take that happily.

1212
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.170
TALIESIN: So that worked. I thought I'd blown that.

1213
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.450
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

1214
00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.450
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my my percentile dice

1215
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:22.720
to try and cast Commune if that makes sense.

1216
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.090
MATT: Oh, so you're using your Divine Intervention

1217
00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:25.590
to commune with the Wildmother?

1218
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:26.760
Okay, give it a shot.

1219
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.870
LAURA: I'm going to set up all my little

1220
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.188
statues that we've spent all this time making.

1221
00:48:31.188 --> 00:48:32.137
I'm going to have so many

1222
00:48:32.137 --> 00:48:33.839
little teeny Traveler dicks sitting around me.

1223
00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:35.810
MATT: Perfect.

1224
00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:38.665
LAURA: Ooh, Caleb! Will you cast pretty lights or something?

1225
00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:40.630
So that it makes it extra special pretty?

1226
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.372
TRAVIS: Yes, cast Widogast's Pretty Lights.

1227
00:48:44.372 --> 00:48:47.240
LIAM: I cast Widogast's Pretty Lights.

1228
00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.750
They are green, they are glowing a pale green

1229
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.840
and floating around Jester's head.

1230
00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.028
TRAVIS: That's really pretty.

1231
00:48:53.028 --> 00:48:55.213
MARISHA: Widogast's Hues.

1232
00:48:55.213 --> 00:48:57.609
MATT: (laughs)

1233
00:48:57.609 --> 00:48:59.410
LAURA: This is pretty great! Now that I know

1234
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.535
that you're not actually a goddy-god god,

1235
00:49:01.535 --> 00:49:03.040
I can just, like, talk you right now

1236
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.310
like I would normally talk to you.

1237
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:06.210
So hey, can you call me here really fast?

1238
00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.650
Because I've got some major questions

1239
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.210
I need to ask you and we need your help.

1240
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:16.210
MATT: The dried and rotted bits of vine and leaf

1241
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:19.930
that originally congealed around Fjord's wound begin

1242
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.196
to blow with the wind. (air whooshing)

1243
00:49:22.196 --> 00:49:25.720
As they blow, they seem to scatter wider and create more

1244
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.120
in their space. As the swirl passes your vision,

1245
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.830
it seems to wipe into the cloaked figure that's so familiar

1246
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.610
to you as Artagan steps forward and goes,

1247
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:36.990
"Hello my dear."
LAURA: Hi.

1248
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:38.020
MATT: "You have some questions?"

1249
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.790
LAURA: Oh my gosh, did you--

1250
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:41.000
I'm not going to ask you that.

1251
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.356
We just had a crazy fight.

1252
00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:45.770
MATT: "(laughter) You're learning. Proud of you.

1253
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:46.790
LAURA: So Fjord

1254
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.500
has a thing like, a ball, an orb, an eyeball stuck inside

1255
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.333
of his body.

1256
00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:52.407
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

1257
00:49:52.407 --> 00:49:54.820
LAURA: And these dudes are, like, coming after him for it.

1258
00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.360
They're like we really want to let Uk'otoa (Uk'otoa) out.

1259
00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.535
MATT: "No!"

1260
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.150
LAURA: And I was wondering--
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

1261
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:06.817
LAURA: If <i>you</i> know how to get the orb out of him?

1262
00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.964
MATT: The questions--

1263
00:50:13.964 --> 00:50:15.388
LAURA: (laughs) Okay, okay.
MATT: Hold on, hold on.

1264
00:50:15.388 --> 00:50:18.055
No, no, you asked your question. The answer is,

1265
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.980
"I believe I have an inkling, yes."

1266
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.819
LAURA: Aw! Come on, man!

1267
00:50:25.819 --> 00:50:27.263
MATT: "Not my rules."

1268
00:50:27.263 --> 00:50:28.346
SAM: Is that the only question you get?

1269
00:50:28.346 --> 00:50:30.250
LAURA: No, I get two more.
SAM: Okay.

1270
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.180
LAURA: Okay, okay.

1271
00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.039
I got to think of how I'm going to phrase this.

1272
00:50:33.039 --> 00:50:35.279
TRAVIS: Does it involve me dying?

1273
00:50:35.279 --> 00:50:37.037
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

1274
00:50:42.262 --> 00:50:46.262
LAURA: Do we have to, like, cut him open to get it out?

1275
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.930
MATT: "I... wouldn't recommend it."

1276
00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.787
LAURA: Okay, okay, that's good to know.

1277
00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.065
TRAVIS: I like him more.

1278
00:50:58.065 --> 00:51:01.148
MARISHA: (laughs)
LIAM: Let's not be hasty.

1279
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:07.810
LAURA: Is it something that's within my skill set, now?

1280
00:51:11.794 --> 00:51:15.052
MATT: "I think you are quite capable, Jester."

1281
00:51:17.706 --> 00:51:18.765
LAURA: Okay.

1282
00:51:18.765 --> 00:51:21.750
MATT: (whooshing) And vanishes into in to the air.

1283
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.083
MARISHA: Magic eight ball bullshit.

1284
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.680
LAURA: He's so, so smart.

1285
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.610
Okay, so something that I can do.

1286
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.880
LIAM: You have removed
types of curses before, have you not?

1287
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.480
LAURA: I mean, yeah, Greater Restoration,

1288
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.880
but does that remove a ball from somebody?

1289
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.780
SAM: You know a lot of spells.
MATT: I will say,

1290
00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.580
you guys

1291
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.604
expended a hell of a lot of Greater Restoration diamonds

1292
00:51:48.604 --> 00:51:51.010
when you were at the Clay family.

1293
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.510
More than you had technically

1294
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.410
had at the ready.

1295
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:55.243
TALIESIN: That's true.

1296
00:51:55.243 --> 00:51:57.450
MATT: So unless you guys have picked up specifically?

1297
00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.390
TALIESIN: No, I don't think so.
MATT: Beyond the diamonds

1298
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:59.233
that you just used on Revivify,

1299
00:51:59.233 --> 00:52:00.738
you do not have Greater Restoration--

1300
00:52:00.738 --> 00:52:01.758
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1301
00:52:01.758 --> 00:52:02.670
MATT: -- capabilities.
LIAM: What do you need for it?

1302
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.410
LAURA: I need diamond dust, at least 100 gold's worth.

1303
00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:06.998
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1304
00:52:06.998 --> 00:52:08.450
LAURA: I have a diamond--

1305
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.371
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we--
LAURA: -- but I shouldn't use it, no.

1306
00:52:11.371 --> 00:52:13.196
SAM: I have gold dust.

1307
00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:17.590
LAURA: I don't need that, I need diamond dust. Orly!

1308
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:19.700
MATT: You see him interfacing with the second of the ships

1309
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.760
that's now currently turning back

1310
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.270
and slowly making its way

1311
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.140
towards its position in the armada formation.

1312
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.422
Turns back, "Mm-hmm?"

1313
00:52:27.422 --> 00:52:30.373
LAURA: Orly, do you have any diamond dust on you

1314
00:52:30.373 --> 00:52:33.951
because I know you do your enchanted tattoos and stuff.

1315
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:35.026
Did anybody--
MATT: "Well,

1316
00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:37.968
"my skill set definitely allows

1317
00:52:37.968 --> 00:52:40.784
"m-m-me to work with it,

1318
00:52:40.784 --> 00:52:45.507
"but my customers have to provide

1319
00:52:45.507 --> 00:52:49.012
"the components.

1320
00:52:49.012 --> 00:52:49.845
"You understand?"

1321
00:52:49.845 --> 00:52:52.140
LAURA: Yeah, of course, of course, of course.

1322
00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:52.973
MATT: "Yeah."

1323
00:52:54.361 --> 00:52:56.086
TRAVIS: There's no way that being stabbed

1324
00:52:56.086 --> 00:52:58.530
by one of those swords is like

1325
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:03.530
a slowly growing disease, is it?

1326
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.120
SAM: Sure, I mean, everything is possible--
TRAVIS: I might slowly change into that?

1327
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.537
Is there any way to detect a disease or a poison or--

1328
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:14.179
LAURA: Detect Good and Evil, maybe, or detect,

1329
00:53:14.179 --> 00:53:15.590
do we have Detect Poison?

1330
00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:17.788
I don't have anything like that prepared--

1331
00:53:17.788 --> 00:53:18.829
TRAVIS: I just don't know if I need it.

1332
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:20.610
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Essek.

1333
00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.201
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Don't want Orly

1334
00:53:22.201 --> 00:53:24.640
turning into a fish person.

1335
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.473
LAURA: Hey Essek,

1336
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:29.040
do you have any diamonds on you

1337
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.800
that you'd be willing to give me

1338
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.590
like something worth, like, 100 gold or something?

1339
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.640
I promise I will pay you back

1340
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.530
or I could give you some gold now.

1341
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:41.445
I really need it.

1342
00:53:41.445 --> 00:53:43.783
Can you just come over here if you have it?

1343
00:53:43.783 --> 00:53:46.893
MATT: For the element of that message that he did receive.

1344
00:53:46.893 --> 00:53:47.976
He responds.

1345
00:53:49.274 --> 00:53:52.182
"Ah. (sniffs)

1346
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.337
"It is early, Jester."

1347
00:53:55.337 --> 00:53:58.170
LAURA: Oh shit, it's 2:30 in the morning.

1348
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:03.030
MATT: "Unfortunately, that is not the type of component

1349
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.097
"that I prepared for the journey."

1350
00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.210
That's it.

1351
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:13.970
SAM: I have this stuff that we got way back in,

1352
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:16.940
I don't know Zadash, Rexxentrum,

1353
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.300
have no idea where we got this,

1354
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.720
this bag of green glass dust stuff.

1355
00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.553
TALIESIN: I mean--

1356
00:54:23.553 --> 00:54:26.270
SAM: Does that do? Does that do something?

1357
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:27.940
LAURA: It's not diamond dust, though.

1358
00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.360
SAM: I know, but does it take the place of that?

1359
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.160
MATT: How much do you have?

1360
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.100
SAM: 800 gold worth of residuum.

1361
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.350
MATT: Residuum, by its nature,

1362
00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.065
can be used to replace any amount of

1363
00:54:39.065 --> 00:54:42.059
money's worth of a material component.

1364
00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:43.420
That's part of the reason why

1365
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:47.410
it's also so sought after and so rare.

1366
00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:49.970
TALIESIN: Can I get 100 gold?

1367
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.364
SAM: I mean, sure, yeah, I don't know.

1368
00:54:51.364 --> 00:54:52.578
TALIESIN: We can do this, if you like.

1369
00:54:52.578 --> 00:54:56.493
This is, let's give this a roll.

1370
00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:59.254
LAURA: Caduceus is going to do it.

1371
00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:00.512
SAM: You've done a lot tonight.

1372
00:55:00.512 --> 00:55:01.661
MARISHA: (laughs)

1373
00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:03.180
TALIESIN: I would recommend,

1374
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:06.800
I would recommend holding his hand, this may hurt.

1375
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.400
SAM: Or his abs.
TALIESIN: Or his abs.

1376
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.260
LAURA: Hold my hand, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Just a second.

1377
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:11.952
What are we doing?

1378
00:55:11.952 --> 00:55:12.820
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine--
LAURA: We're just going to

1379
00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.120
try something.

1380
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.020
SAM: Have you ever gotten a tooth pulled?

1381
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:19.080
TRAVIS: Yes.

1382
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.566
SAM: It's like that.

1383
00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:22.240
TRAVIS: That didn't feel very good.

1384
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.565
SAM: Well.
LAURA: Then hold my hand.

1385
00:55:24.565 --> 00:55:26.835
You can squeeze it as hard as you want.

1386
00:55:26.835 --> 00:55:29.950
ASHLEY: Do you want to bite down on something?

1387
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:31.030
MARISHA: You can use my bo staff.

1388
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.740
TRAVIS: This is making me feel--
MARISHA: You want to bite

1389
00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.573
on the bo staff?
TRAVIS: (groaning)

1390
00:55:33.573 --> 00:55:34.781
MARISHA: Oh, it's a little big,

1391
00:55:34.781 --> 00:55:38.072
that's really big.

1392
00:55:38.072 --> 00:55:40.188
SAM: Do you want me to tell you a joke to lighten the mood?

1393
00:55:40.188 --> 00:55:41.686
ASHLEY: Take a swig from the flask.

1394
00:55:41.686 --> 00:55:42.920
TRAVIS: I have a bo staff in my hand.

1395
00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.184
ASHLEY: Okay, you'll be fine.

1396
00:55:44.184 --> 00:55:45.580
TALIESIN: Just for added bonus,

1397
00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.299
I'm going to cast this at, like, 6th-level.

1398
00:55:47.299 --> 00:55:48.451
TRAVIS: Fuck you--

1399
00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:49.790
MATT: So you're casting Greater Restoration?

1400
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:50.723
TALIESIN: Yep.

1401
00:55:50.723 --> 00:55:53.343
SAM: I'm going to cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter on him.

1402
00:55:53.343 --> 00:55:55.109
LAURA: No!
MATT: On Fjord?

1403
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:57.730
SAM: Yeah, just so he's laughing while this happens.

1404
00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:59.105
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: (manic laughter)

1405
00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:00.905
MATT: Roll a wisdom saving throw, Fjord.

1406
00:56:00.905 --> 00:56:02.854
TRAVIS: (manic laughter)
LIAM: Love that Joker.

1407
00:56:02.854 --> 00:56:04.660
(laughter)

1408
00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.493
TRAVIS: 18.

1409
00:56:05.493 --> 00:56:06.932
SAM: He beat it.

1410
00:56:06.932 --> 00:56:08.628
Well, I'll still tell you the joke anyway.

1411
00:56:08.628 --> 00:56:12.888
Why did Captain Tusktooth
start smoking cigarettes at the dock?

1412
00:56:12.888 --> 00:56:13.890
TRAVIS: Why?

1413
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.598
SAM: <i>Pier</i> pressure.

1414
00:56:15.598 --> 00:56:18.950
ASHLEY: Oh, wow.

1415
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:22.336
MATT: Yeah, everyone takes psychic damage at that one.

1416
00:56:22.336 --> 00:56:25.451
SAM: Didn't work, he didn't laugh, everyone. Sorry.

1417
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:26.653
LAURA: Yeah.

1418
00:56:26.653 --> 00:56:31.650
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to take the residuum

1419
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.443
and I'm just going to pulse it through you

1420
00:56:33.443 --> 00:56:35.465
and see what happens and give it a--

1421
00:56:35.465 --> 00:56:38.401
MATT: Mark 100 gold's worth of residuum off of your list.

1422
00:56:38.401 --> 00:56:40.927
TALIESIN: That's my level six for the day.

1423
00:56:40.927 --> 00:56:42.800
MATT: As you concentrate, Caduceus,

1424
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.360
and reach out towards Fjord's chest,

1425
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:50.310
you find your vision darken

1426
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.940
and your instinct immediately is that

1427
00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.823
fight or flight, that fear impulse kick in.

1428
00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:01.460
But you find yourself surrounded in warmth,

1429
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.985
like you were dropped into a warm bath.

1430
00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.540
Caduceus, as you concentrate

1431
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.840
the same lichen that grows upon your armor

1432
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.510
begins to grow from your fingertips

1433
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.160
and find its way, gathering at the center

1434
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.450
of Fjord's chest, this bright pink plume of fungus

1435
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:23.990
begins to just grow and generate around the sternum.

1436
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.560
In you, in this moment with your eyes closed

1437
00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.113
that warmth, you feel this twinge of pain

1438
00:57:32.113 --> 00:57:36.304
right there that begins to grow and grow

1439
00:57:36.304 --> 00:57:39.830
and burn and sear.
LAURA: You can squeeze my hand.

1440
00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:43.170
MATT: And you feel him, his hand squeeze tightly.

1441
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:44.920
Nausea begins to kick in

1442
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.520
wave after wave as this horrible pain

1443
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.780
begins to just burn from the inside.

1444
00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.417
It is <i>awful</i>.

1445
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:56.898
It begins to come in such heavy waves

1446
00:57:56.898 --> 00:57:59.320
that you find yourself falling to your knees

1447
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.920
and that nausea is burning heavily

1448
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:06.940
within the depths of your chest and belly.

1449
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.130
Caduceus, as you hold tightly,

1450
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:10.120
you watch as Caduceus falls to his knees

1451
00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.870
and begins to just shutter.

1452
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.540
All of you begin to grow nervous

1453
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.140
with what is happening,

1454
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.994
especially with how now barely recovering

1455
00:58:18.994 --> 00:58:20.430
from the edge of death.

1456
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:24.754
He seems to be convulsing in the way that he is.

1457
00:58:24.754 --> 00:58:26.420
LAURA: You're hurting him.

1458
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.173
ASHLEY: I'm going to link my arm and his arm

1459
00:58:28.173 --> 00:58:31.770
just to keep them there and to keep them upright and safe.

1460
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:32.603
MATT: Okay.

1461
00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:38.065
The pain begins to entirely consume your perspective,

1462
00:58:38.065 --> 00:58:40.370
the warmth isn't there.

1463
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:43.540
The darkness is barely something you could concentrate on.

1464
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.580
It is just the pain

1465
00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.738
and it feels like a burning white hot poker

1466
00:58:47.738 --> 00:58:50.240
right in the center of your chest.

1467
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.932
Moving up towards your sternum, up to your clavicle.

1468
00:58:54.932 --> 00:58:56.980
As the nausea kicks in,

1469
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.046
you find yourself retching.

1470
00:59:00.046 --> 00:59:02.520
You watch as Fjord suddenly doubles over

1471
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.170
and vomits what seems to be gallons

1472
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.689
of frothy sea water onto the deck of the ship.

1473
00:59:08.689 --> 00:59:09.790
(groaning)

1474
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:14.748
This horrible, guttural, all muscles tensing vomit,

1475
00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.143
and as the seawater splashes onto it,

1476
00:59:18.143 --> 00:59:21.255
with a heavy (thudding),

1477
00:59:21.255 --> 00:59:23.370
you see a singular cloven crystal.

1478
00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:25.860
TALIESIN: Don't touch it.

1479
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.102
Somebody pick it up with an object

1480
00:59:27.102 --> 00:59:30.370
and let's put it in the bag as quickly as possible.

1481
00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:31.449
MARISHA: I--
MATT: Your vision returns.

1482
00:59:31.449 --> 00:59:35.000
MARISHA: -- take off my sash and scoop it up

1483
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.080
and tie it off.

1484
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.104
LAURA: I hold back his little teeny man bun.

1485
00:59:39.104 --> 00:59:40.526
SAM: You okay, Fjordy?

1486
00:59:40.526 --> 00:59:42.627
MARISHA: Holy shit!

1487
00:59:42.627 --> 00:59:44.210
TALIESIN: Put it in the bag as soon as possible.

1488
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:45.508
SAM: It's coming out of your nose.

1489
00:59:45.508 --> 00:59:47.810
LIAM: If I put it in this, it will gone.

1490
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:48.945
TALIESIN: Perfect.
LIAM: Gone.

1491
00:59:48.945 --> 00:59:50.500
SAM: What does that mean, "gone"?
TRAVIS: It's the, (groaning).

1492
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.050
TALIESIN: How gone?
TRAVIS: It's the amber stone--

1493
00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:54.070
LIAM: Well, no one can see me.

1494
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:55.120
TALIESIN: Perfect.

1495
00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:59.707
LAURA: Use my long sleeve to wipe up Fjord's face and mouth.

1496
00:59:59.707 --> 01:00:01.525
LIAM: Caleb starts placing out the pieces of

1497
01:00:01.525 --> 01:00:04.825
amber around it on the deck,

1498
01:00:04.825 --> 01:00:06.563
and as a ritual, casts

1499
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.265
the Vault of Amber and just goes (whooshing).

1500
01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:13.619
SAM: Widogast's Vault of Amber?
LIAM: No, just Vault of Amber,

1501
01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:15.540
you don't have to say the Widogast part

1502
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.610
every time. Most of the time will suffice,

1503
01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:19.270
but occasionally you can just dial it back

1504
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:20.588
to the actual function of the spell.

1505
01:00:20.588 --> 01:00:23.058
(laughter)

1506
01:00:23.058 --> 01:00:24.058
TALIESIN: It's WGBA.

1507
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:27.383
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1508
01:00:27.383 --> 01:00:28.860
LIAM: I'm going to take all those,

1509
01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.930
I collect them and I put,

1510
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:32.060
I keep the one piece of amber

1511
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.826
on a chain.

1512
01:00:35.826 --> 01:00:37.601
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Hang it next to the other.

1513
01:00:39.184 --> 01:00:41.184
ASHLEY: How do you feel, Fjord?

1514
01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.080
TRAVIS: A few gallons lighter.

1515
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:46.830
I mean, I feel,

1516
01:00:49.056 --> 01:00:51.206
I feel... fine?

1517
01:00:52.526 --> 01:00:54.650
MATT: I mean, given the circumstances,

1518
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:58.086
you don't sense any physical difference

1519
01:00:58.086 --> 01:01:01.030
before or after, beyond

1520
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.863
just a

1521
01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.760
sense of well being that washes over you

1522
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.010
knowing that that thing is out of you.

1523
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.700
TRAVIS: Can I make myself look like Jester?

1524
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.857
MATT: Certainly.

1525
01:01:17.857 --> 01:01:18.690
LAURA: Whoa.

1526
01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:19.970
TRAVIS: Does it work?

1527
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:22.650
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Whew. Okay.

1528
01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:24.200
LAURA: Whoa. What was that about?

1529
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.145
TRAVIS: I'm just making sure I could still,

1530
01:01:27.145 --> 01:01:27.978
you know,

1531
01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:30.600
do things.

1532
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.350
I hadn't realized that was there.

1533
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:37.610
LAURA: It's not the source of your power, Fjord.

1534
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:38.560
TALIESIN: Not anymore.

1535
01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.050
TRAVIS: That's good.

1536
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:42.074
What did it look like?

1537
01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.790
MARISHA: (groaning)
LAURA: Really slimy.

1538
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.720
MARISHA: Crazy.
LAURA: (retching)

1539
01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.080
LIAM: Strangely like an eyeball.

1540
01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.720
TRAVIS: Did it move?

1541
01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.749
LIAM: No, it just rolled and stopped.

1542
01:01:54.749 --> 01:01:55.950
TRAVIS: When you throw up that much,

1543
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.647
the eyes and the nose just go.

1544
01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:00.680
It's like being on a carwash; I couldn't see anything.

1545
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.630
MARISHA: Speaking of-- Marius!

1546
01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:06.059
MATT: (quick footsteps)

1547
01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:07.390
TRAVIS: How did he survive this?

1548
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.680
MATT: "Hey."

1549
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.470
MARISHA: Get a bucket and a mop. Clean up this puke, okay?

1550
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:13.350
SAM: I think you mean swab the deck.

1551
01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:15.570
MARISHA: Swab the deck, Marius.

1552
01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:17.110
LIAM: Stopped raining at the wrong time.

1553
01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:19.026
MATT: "Aye, aye."
TALIESIN: Actually.

1554
01:02:19.026 --> 01:02:20.886
MATT: It's still raining, but he's just--

1555
01:02:20.886 --> 01:02:22.480
MARISHA: Marius, did you kill a guy?

1556
01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.510
Did you kill that guy?

1557
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:26.980
MATT: "I grievously wounded him."

1558
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.708
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1559
01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:29.966
LAURA: Good job, Marius!

1560
01:02:29.966 --> 01:02:32.357
MATT: "Thank you."
TALIESIN: How bad is "grievous"?

1561
01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:33.576
LAURA: It's pretty bad.

1562
01:02:33.576 --> 01:02:34.890
TALIESIN: Okay, well done.

1563
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.417
LAURA: Yeah.

1564
01:02:36.417 --> 01:02:37.740
MARISHA: Good work.

1565
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:38.780
MATT: "I'll get the mop."

1566
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:43.117
TALIESIN: Might get rid of the
bodies of the three fish people.

1567
01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:44.880
Keep the--

1568
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.590
ASHLEY: Yeah, hopefully he's better at cleaning then he is

1569
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.423
at killing--

1570
01:02:47.423 --> 01:02:49.019
TALIESIN: Why do you want to help with that?

1571
01:02:49.019 --> 01:02:50.190
ASHLEY: No.
SAM: Do you think that maybe

1572
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:52.810
Caduceus should cast that spell on all of us

1573
01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.498
just in case we all have strange curses

1574
01:02:55.498 --> 01:02:57.410
or things inside of us?

1575
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:58.470
TALIESIN: That's--
LAURA: Did you go around

1576
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.197
swallowing weird balls, too?

1577
01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:01.381
SAM: I mean.

1578
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:03.430
(laughter)

1579
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:04.683
My teenage years.

1580
01:03:04.683 --> 01:03:06.968
(laughter)
TRAVIS: College was interesting.

1581
01:03:06.968 --> 01:03:09.450
TALIESIN: I think Yasha and I are going to go downstairs

1582
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:11.555
and start gathering up the fish people.

1583
01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:12.421
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast

1584
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:14.595
Decompose on them, too, just--

1585
01:03:14.595 --> 01:03:15.428
TRAVIS: Actually, if you wouldn't

1586
01:03:15.428 --> 01:03:19.133
mind bringing them up here first just to see them.

1587
01:03:19.133 --> 01:03:20.350
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1588
01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:23.010
TALIESIN: Yep.

1589
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.645
(wet plopping)

1590
01:03:24.645 --> 01:03:26.560
MATT: Yeah, they do make a weird (wet plopping)

1591
01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.590
sound as they hit the deck.

1592
01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:29.650
TALIESIN: Like Donald Duck hiccuping.

1593
01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:31.460
TRAVIS: It's like (wet flopping)

1594
01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.035
MARISHA: I know people did some

1595
01:03:33.035 --> 01:03:34.635
passes of them.
MATT: Bass physics.

1596
01:03:34.635 --> 01:03:37.439
(laughter)

1597
01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:40.543
Thanks, Oblivion.

1598
01:03:40.543 --> 01:03:44.200
(laughter)

1599
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.710
MARISHA: Can I strip them down

1600
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:46.543
and turn around

1601
01:03:46.543 --> 01:03:49.809
and, like, see if they have any tattoos, like

1602
01:03:49.809 --> 01:03:51.775
look at the back of their neck--
LAURA: These are the people, people?

1603
01:03:51.775 --> 01:03:52.690
TALIESIN: These are fish people.

1604
01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.180
We have all of them up here now.

1605
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.898
TRAVIS: Could be a bite, could be a stab wound, could be--

1606
01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:58.522
MARISHA: Yeah, I just want to look for
any markings on their body.

1607
01:03:58.522 --> 01:03:59.690
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1608
01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:03.465
MARISHA: Hell, yeah. That's what I do good

1609
01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.500
on my good days.
TRAVIS: Usually.

1610
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.500
MARISHA: Okay.

1611
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.940
19.

1612
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.190
MATT: 19, okay.

1613
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.070
On the the sea spawn creatures,

1614
01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.836
the ones that maintain their fish form.

1615
01:04:15.836 --> 01:04:18.960
You don't see any particular tattoos.

1616
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.050
You do notice they have heavy gills,

1617
01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:23.170
they are very physically altered

1618
01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:24.336
and there are mutations,

1619
01:04:24.336 --> 01:04:26.610
the ones that have, like, the heavy quills

1620
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:28.740
that project from the body.

1621
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.470
They are far from human,

1622
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.360
but no particular markings is beyond

1623
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.294
just their physical alterations.

1624
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.195
The tentacle arms are quite disgusting.

1625
01:04:38.195 --> 01:04:39.570
They have their own

1626
01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.040
like a shark skin

1627
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.280
where from one direction it's moving then the other,

1628
01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.407
and it pricks up into a very grating texture.

1629
01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.827
The humanoid bodies that have reverted from the three there.

1630
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.640
You do notice on the leader,

1631
01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.920
the lead one in the middle of the chest

1632
01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.370
there is a familiar single

1633
01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.815
yellow tattoo of an eye.

1634
01:05:04.271 --> 01:05:07.545
MARISHA: Was this is the one we cut into?

1635
01:05:07.545 --> 01:05:08.378
MATT: Yes.

1636
01:05:10.496 --> 01:05:11.450
So you would have already noticed it,

1637
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:12.600
but it didn't come up earlier.

1638
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.266
MARISHA: Right.
MATT: But yeah.

1639
01:05:14.266 --> 01:05:16.334
LIAM: Well, it's half, half of it's here--

1640
01:05:16.334 --> 01:05:17.458
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: -- and half of it over here.

1641
01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:19.693
MARISHA: Yeah, you'd have to put it back together.

1642
01:05:19.693 --> 01:05:21.180
TRAVIS: And these ones that have been brought up,

1643
01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.740
have they transformed back into their original states?

1644
01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.165
MATT: Yes. That's the elf and the Goliath.

1645
01:05:27.165 --> 01:05:28.160
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, sorry.

1646
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.243
There's no others, right?

1647
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.580
LAURA: Does it look like the Avantika's tattoo?

1648
01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.750
MATT: It's similar, but the design's different.

1649
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.978
It's a similar type of,

1650
01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:43.894
you know, a very much a

1651
01:05:43.894 --> 01:05:45.805
tattoo scarring experience

1652
01:05:45.805 --> 01:05:47.930
that is part of a worship

1653
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:50.570
or a symbolism for a familiar entity.

1654
01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:53.090
SAM: Did you have one of those tattoos?

1655
01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:55.350
TRAVIS: I did, but you don't want to see where it is.

1656
01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.288
MARISHA: Mm.
TRAVIS: It's very painful.

1657
01:05:57.288 --> 01:05:58.630
LAURA: Right on the taint.

1658
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:00.850
TRAVIS: Yep, right on the in-betweenus, just--

1659
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:01.808
SAM: Wow.

1660
01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:06.660
TRAVIS: Had to hold my ankles and ride the lightning.

1661
01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.396
Just (tapping).

1662
01:06:08.396 --> 01:06:11.463
SAM: Oh ho ho! That's right, there's no machines.

1663
01:06:11.463 --> 01:06:13.304
(laughter)

1664
01:06:13.304 --> 01:06:15.983
TRAVIS: Yeah. "(pained) Ah, ah, ah, ah!"

1665
01:06:15.983 --> 01:06:19.066
(laughter)

1666
01:06:20.882 --> 01:06:21.727
MARISHA: That's what they call an Uk'otoa.

1667
01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:23.850
TRAVIS: Just a couple of times that orb came up,

1668
01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:25.100
and swallowed back down.

1669
01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.382
LIAM: Five years, everybody!

1670
01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:29.245
(laughter)

1671
01:06:29.245 --> 01:06:30.964
TRAVIS: The art that's going to come out of that--

1672
01:06:30.964 --> 01:06:33.480
(laughter)
SAM: Oh no!

1673
01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.729
Hopefully a gif.
TRAVIS: (like Orly) Mm.

1674
01:06:35.729 --> 01:06:38.741
(laughter)

1675
01:06:38.741 --> 01:06:43.067
I don't know if we're counting.
(laughter)

1676
01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:45.356
LIAM: (like Orly) Mm, mm.

1677
01:06:45.356 --> 01:06:46.209
TALIESIN: Chiseled.

1678
01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:48.092
Chiseled, is as it was described.

1679
01:06:50.431 --> 01:06:51.512
TRAVIS: So it's--

1680
01:06:51.512 --> 01:06:54.856
MATT: (as Orly) "M-m--

1681
01:06:54.856 --> 01:06:56.917
"Might want to bite down on this--"

1682
01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:59.301
(laughter)

1683
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.840
LIAM: Boy, that was a two minute detour, guys.

1684
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.430
TALIESIN: Yeah, we needed it. We needed a good laugh.

1685
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:05.794
MATT: It is still raining, it is still freezing.

1686
01:07:05.794 --> 01:07:06.702
LAURA: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1687
01:07:06.702 --> 01:07:07.877
TRAVIS: A.M. hours?

1688
01:07:07.877 --> 01:07:09.693
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: It's still 2:45 now.

1689
01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:10.951
SAM: We should go to sleep. We got to go to sleep.

1690
01:07:10.951 --> 01:07:11.784
LAURA: We got to go to sleep.

1691
01:07:11.784 --> 01:07:13.609
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
SAM: Let's toss this bodies over.

1692
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:16.070
TALIESIN: Let's keep the humans and toss the fish.

1693
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:19.800
I'm going to Decompose the fish

1694
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.273
if we want to drop them.

1695
01:07:21.273 --> 01:07:22.560
MATT: They don't grow fungus,

1696
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.250
but you watch as the body begin

1697
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:25.480
to grow a little more translucent

1698
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.390
and bits of foam begin to gather at the joints,

1699
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:29.636
before you throw them overboard.

1700
01:07:29.636 --> 01:07:33.469
(splashing)

1701
01:07:34.804 --> 01:07:37.077
LAURA: I should really wash my arm off.

1702
01:07:37.077 --> 01:07:37.910
SAM: Yeah.

1703
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:39.671
LAURA: I'm going to wash my arm off.

1704
01:07:39.671 --> 01:07:41.730
MATT: Yeah, you're like halfway to the bicep.

1705
01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:42.940
SAM: Should we make a dome?

1706
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.090
TRAVIS: Would you like to come to the captain's quarters?

1707
01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:47.340
Or should I join you in the small room?

1708
01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.680
LAURA: I feel like it's safer if we're

1709
01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.140
in the captain's quarters
SAM: He doesn't want to be alone.

1710
01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:51.990
LAURA: Well, he shouldn't be.

1711
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.368
LIAM: Is there room for all of us in there?

1712
01:07:53.368 --> 01:07:54.940
TRAVIS: The last time I woke up there was a blade

1713
01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:55.950
sticking out of my chest.

1714
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:57.700
I don't know, is there enough room?

1715
01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.989
MATT: I mean.
TRAVIS: It's cozy.

1716
01:07:59.989 --> 01:08:01.139
MATT: It'll be super cozy

1717
01:08:01.139 --> 01:08:02.573
because you have a desk and a bed in that chamber.

1718
01:08:02.573 --> 01:08:05.040
TALIESIN: Is there a room for a dome? We can go downstairs

1719
01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.816
and there's room for the dome, I guess.

1720
01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.460
TRAVIS: We can always get rid of the desk and the bed.

1721
01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.897
No that's fine, we'll go below.

1722
01:08:09.897 --> 01:08:10.730
Below decks.

1723
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:12.540
LIAM: We should do the mid level, not the bottom.

1724
01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.582
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Yes.

1725
01:08:13.582 --> 01:08:15.630
MATT: Okay, so you guys head to the gun deck.

1726
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:17.305
There is a chamber that is

1727
01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:19.214
definitively large enough to fit all of you comfortably.

1728
01:08:19.214 --> 01:08:21.909
LAURA: I had a big bed in my--
MATT: Yeah, okay.

1729
01:08:21.909 --> 01:08:26.801
TRAVIS: And I did cast underwater breathing
at two in the morning.

1730
01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:28.380
Okay,

1731
01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.808
you guys ready yourselves for an evening's rest,

1732
01:08:30.808 --> 01:08:35.808
eventually going to complete the rest of your night's sleep.

1733
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:38.200
So go ahead and take your long rest.

1734
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.758
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1735
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:44.063
LIAM: I'm also-- Any time we do this,

1736
01:08:44.063 --> 01:08:46.730
Caleb will go down to the bottom level of the ship

1737
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:50.427
and use his silver wire to make an X

1738
01:08:50.427 --> 01:08:53.360
across the ceiling for where he believes

1739
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.250
we have stationed the dome

1740
01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:58.040
so that there is an alarm set beneath the dome.

1741
01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.260
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

1742
01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.110
LIAM: That will be part of the bedtime ritual.

1743
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:03.502
MATT: Okay, sleep doesn't come all that easy.

1744
01:09:03.502 --> 01:09:05.352
As there is the sound of Gallan.

1745
01:09:05.352 --> 01:09:07.150
(hammering)

1746
01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:10.110
LAURA: Wow, 2:30, good for him.
MATT: You told him to go fix stuff

1747
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:11.610
and it was their--

1748
01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:13.677
They're sleeping during the day
when you guys are running the ship.

1749
01:09:13.677 --> 01:09:15.050
So you guys are running odd hours,

1750
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:20.050
so there's always some crew manning it as you continue.

1751
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.440
But you manage it.

1752
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.421
The gun deck does have a bit of damage,

1753
01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:26.400
both from the fight, the scuffle

1754
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.303
and you can see about three of the cannons

1755
01:09:31.303 --> 01:09:33.080
have just hundreds and hundreds

1756
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.640
of tiny gash marks across the iron.

1757
01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.513
Not enough to damage them or make them non-functional,

1758
01:09:38.513 --> 01:09:40.870
but they definitely look textured and weathered.

1759
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:43.373
Some of the wood around them is splintered.

1760
01:09:43.373 --> 01:09:45.450
The wood in the ceiling has a couple of moments

1761
01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:47.019
or a couple locations that look a bit damaged.

1762
01:09:47.019 --> 01:09:48.746
That's what's Gallan's currently working on repairing

1763
01:09:48.746 --> 01:09:51.369
and getting some patching elements--

1764
01:09:51.369 --> 01:09:52.609
LAURA: Whoops.

1765
01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:54.997
TALIESIN: Look at all these
lovely spells I got back. That's so nice.

1766
01:09:54.997 --> 01:09:57.942
LAURA: (chuckles)

1767
01:09:57.942 --> 01:10:00.375
MATT: The next day comes to you

1768
01:10:01.214 --> 01:10:02.148
without issue.

1769
01:10:02.148 --> 01:10:04.506
LAURA: Without issue!

1770
01:10:04.506 --> 01:10:05.886
MATT: The rain does, however,

1771
01:10:05.886 --> 01:10:09.136
greet you in the morning as you awaken.

1772
01:10:13.232 --> 01:10:16.808
So at this point, you guys have a few more days to continue.

1773
01:10:16.808 --> 01:10:18.999
The next day progresses,

1774
01:10:18.999 --> 01:10:23.124
which I believe is the sixth day...?

1775
01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:25.470
LAURA: The fifth day, I think.

1776
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:26.678
MATT: Fifth day, okay.

1777
01:10:26.678 --> 01:10:28.840
TALIESIN: Want to interrogate the bodies?

1778
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.410
SAM and TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

1779
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.330
SAM: Do we eat breakfast first,

1780
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:33.980
or while we're interrogating?

1781
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.110
We should eat breakfast.
TALIESIN: Let's have breakfast first.

1782
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:38.371
TRAVIS: And Caleb, your magic is so impressive.

1783
01:10:38.371 --> 01:10:39.690
I sometimes take it for granted,

1784
01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:41.581
where does that go?

1785
01:10:41.581 --> 01:10:46.430
Just to another dimension or is it just hidden, or?

1786
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:50.510
LIAM: Yeah, well, it is with me, but it is not

1787
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:53.010
on this plane. It is anchored to a point

1788
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:58.010
within this one specific hunk of amber.

1789
01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:02.580
So anchored to that, and wherever I bring said anchor,

1790
01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.651
that pocket travels with.

1791
01:11:04.651 --> 01:11:07.714
TRAVIS: So if someone were to trace or try to locate it,

1792
01:11:07.714 --> 01:11:10.110
it wouldn't point to your hunk of amber?

1793
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:12.054
LIAM: Well, I also have this.

1794
01:11:12.054 --> 01:11:14.870
And I pull out the necklace I've had

1795
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.170
since the beginning of our story.

1796
01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:21.220
This keeps me and all my possessions hidden.

1797
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.970
Not you or any of the rest of you,

1798
01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:28.886
but your cat's eye marble is now

1799
01:11:30.894 --> 01:11:31.780
erased.

1800
01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.871
LAURA: Wow. That would've been really useful

1801
01:11:33.871 --> 01:11:35.330
when we had the beacon on us.

1802
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:36.452
TALIESIN: Your--

1803
01:11:36.452 --> 01:11:39.820
LIAM: I haven't figured out how to do it yet.

1804
01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.170
TRAVIS: I'd prefer that. I just didn't want

1805
01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:43.160
all of a sudden the attention of this thing

1806
01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.670
to be pointed at you.

1807
01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:46.890
TALIESIN: Probably know what you look like.

1808
01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:50.520
LIAM: I think attention is still probably pointed at you.

1809
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.345
You know, people have tried to find us

1810
01:11:52.345 --> 01:11:54.122
as we have tried to find other people

1811
01:11:54.122 --> 01:11:58.809
and you're still the last one who had it

1812
01:11:58.809 --> 01:12:00.900
so they would come with questions, perhaps.

1813
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.880
MARISHA: Unless they were tracking the ball directly.

1814
01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.120
SAM: And we just killed

1815
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.710
five or six of his men.

1816
01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:11.490
So maybe--
LAURA: Oh man, Uk'otoa

1817
01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:12.570
is so pissed at you.
SAM: (whispered) Uk'otoa.

1818
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:13.403
LAURA: (whispered) Uk'otoa.

1819
01:12:13.403 --> 01:12:17.050
MARISHA: I have a feeling
Uk'otoa's not the sentimental type.

1820
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:20.522
SAM: Yeah, but--
LAURA: He's a ragey type.

1821
01:12:20.522 --> 01:12:23.074
MARISHA: Feel like he can get more fish people.

1822
01:12:23.074 --> 01:12:24.830
SAM: There are more fish people in the sea.

1823
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:26.355
MARISHA: There are plenty of fish people.

1824
01:12:26.355 --> 01:12:28.068
TRAVIS: We should see if these are just devotees,

1825
01:12:28.068 --> 01:12:30.310
or if they were taken.

1826
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:33.124
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

1827
01:12:33.124 --> 01:12:35.802
MARISHA: What do we do with the ball now that we have it?

1828
01:12:35.802 --> 01:12:39.080
TRAVIS: What do you mean?
It's in his hidden dimension of nowhere.

1829
01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.238
LAURA: We just keep it forever, hidden away.

1830
01:12:41.238 --> 01:12:42.760
LIAM: Possibly find a way to destroy it.

1831
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.690
TALIESIN: I don't know if it can be destroyed.

1832
01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:46.120
At the very least we could take it

1833
01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.034
to the happy fun ball at some point.

1834
01:12:48.034 --> 01:12:49.270
SAM: Put a ball in the ball?

1835
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:51.547
TALIESIN: Put a ball in the ball.

1836
01:12:51.547 --> 01:12:52.723
MARISHA: Meta-ball!

1837
01:12:52.723 --> 01:12:55.360
LAURA: What if we actually put the ball into the lava.

1838
01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.768
LIAM: We are-- yeah. Going to volcano, I was about to say.

1839
01:12:57.768 --> 01:12:58.601
LAURA: Yeah.

1840
01:12:58.601 --> 01:13:00.379
SAM: Maybe it'll have some cool effect

1841
01:13:00.379 --> 01:13:02.935
that you can use to enthrall the guests.

1842
01:13:02.935 --> 01:13:04.260
LAURA: Ah, that's a good idea.

1843
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.720
Maybe we can turn all of the other people

1844
01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.820
that worship the Traveler into fish people.

1845
01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:08.653
SAM: Wow!

1846
01:13:08.653 --> 01:13:09.850
TRAVIS: You know, you throw those pine cones

1847
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:10.850
into the fire they burn like

1848
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:13.090
blue and green, but this one's like, yellow.

1849
01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:16.597
LAURA: Yeah. Like a crazy big eyeball.

1850
01:13:16.597 --> 01:13:17.625
SAM: Crazy fire colors.

1851
01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:19.194
MARISHA: Whoa!

1852
01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:21.576
TRAVIS: I'm still a little woozy.

1853
01:13:21.576 --> 01:13:23.780
LIAM: Maybe it would anger a titan at the bottom of the sea

1854
01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:26.198
and create a tidal wave, it's hard to predict--

1855
01:13:26.198 --> 01:13:28.270
LAURA: You never know.

1856
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.490
TRAVIS: Let's ask some questions.

1857
01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.090
TALIESIN: Think about what you want to know.

1858
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.923
TRAVIS: Oh, me?

1859
01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.690
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

1860
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:37.523
TRAVIS: Okay.

1861
01:13:38.423 --> 01:13:41.878
I haven't thought about it at all, let's do this.

1862
01:13:41.878 --> 01:13:43.132
TALIESIN: Which one do you want to start with?

1863
01:13:43.132 --> 01:13:43.965
SAM: The leader.

1864
01:13:43.965 --> 01:13:47.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, Tattoo McFuck Ribs.

1865
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.381
MARISHA: Mm, I love the McFuckRib.
TALIESIN: You don't want to work up to it?

1866
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:50.363
TRAVIS: We can ask all of them?

1867
01:13:50.363 --> 01:13:51.570
LAURA: It only comes every once

1868
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.699
in a while, but--
TALIESIN: I got a lot of these.

1869
01:13:53.699 --> 01:13:55.650
TRAVIS: It's true, let's ask the--

1870
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:57.983
TALIESIN: One at a time and only once.

1871
01:13:57.983 --> 01:14:00.247
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's start with the female elf, then.

1872
01:14:00.247 --> 01:14:02.480
TALIESIN: All right, that helps if they see a friendly face.

1873
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.150
So hold on.

1874
01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:07.790
I'm going to look like Avantika.

1875
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:09.798
SAM: Oh.
MATT: Okay.

1876
01:14:09.798 --> 01:14:11.003
TALIESIN: This is weird.

1877
01:14:11.003 --> 01:14:14.987
LIAM: Will she be able to see all of us or just you?

1878
01:14:14.987 --> 01:14:17.986
LAURA: Do you sound like Avantika or do you sound like--

1879
01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:20.256
TALIESIN: I sound like me, really.

1880
01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:21.300
LAURA: That's great.

1881
01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:23.383
TALIESIN: I can, I can try and--

1882
01:14:23.383 --> 01:14:25.900
LAURA: No, that's not very good.

1883
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.233
TALIESIN: But they're not really that smart, so.

1884
01:14:31.402 --> 01:14:32.485
I think that they only really

1885
01:14:32.485 --> 01:14:35.867
pay attention to the person who casts the spell.

1886
01:14:35.867 --> 01:14:38.560
I think everything else is just not there.

1887
01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.518
MARISHA: This is so weird right now.
TALIESIN: This is not life.

1888
01:14:42.518 --> 01:14:43.926
I'm really glad that I can't see

1889
01:14:43.926 --> 01:14:45.837
what this looks like right now.

1890
01:14:45.837 --> 01:14:49.510
It feel, whoa, but yeah.

1891
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:50.509
I'm also so short.
MARISHA: I feel like that's what

1892
01:14:50.509 --> 01:14:52.450
Avantika sounded like on Sunday mornings.

1893
01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:54.679
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

1894
01:14:54.679 --> 01:14:56.570
All right, I'm going to put one of them up.

1895
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:57.403
MATT: Which one?

1896
01:14:57.403 --> 01:14:59.107
TALIESIN: Which one do you want, the half orc or female.

1897
01:14:59.107 --> 01:15:00.897
SAM: The female.

1898
01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.230
LAURA: The female elf.

1899
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:04.546
TALIESIN: Let's put the elf.

1900
01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:05.379
MATT: Okay.

1901
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:10.120
TALIESIN: Start burning some of the fungus underneath,

1902
01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.260
getting the spores out

1903
01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.150
and I'm going to cast Speak with Dead.

1904
01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:15.520
MATT: Okay.

1905
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.250
The dull, lifeless look in the eyes

1906
01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:21.450
is maintained though the eyes do (slurping),

1907
01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.341
roll to look towards you.

1908
01:15:23.341 --> 01:15:24.258
TRAVIS: So great.

1909
01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.913
MATT: Just looking at you.

1910
01:15:29.668 --> 01:15:30.840
SAM: He's such a good sleeper.

1911
01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.520
TALIESIN: Who gave you your mission to

1912
01:15:34.128 --> 01:15:36.176
find the orb?

1913
01:15:36.176 --> 01:15:38.426
MATT: "(raspy breathing)

1914
01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.308
"Uk'otoa."

1915
01:15:41.308 --> 01:15:42.975
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

1916
01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:47.659
MATT: I got to finally do it back to you guys.

1917
01:15:47.659 --> 01:15:52.518
TRAVIS: I would ask, was she a willing follower

1918
01:15:52.518 --> 01:15:54.640
and the other one would be

1919
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.310
does she now has she came to take that previous shape?

1920
01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.810
TALIESIN: Were you willing follower of Uk'otoa?

1921
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:03.227
ALL: Uk'otoa.

1922
01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.293
MATT: "Always."

1923
01:16:09.926 --> 01:16:14.820
TRAVIS: And ask her how she took her previous shape.

1924
01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.890
TALIESIN: Did the power to take your previous shape

1925
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:19.557
come from you or something else?

1926
01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:26.623
MATT: "It was granted.

1927
01:16:26.623 --> 01:16:29.281
"Reward."

1928
01:16:33.253 --> 01:16:35.437
TALIESIN: It's probably the end of that.

1929
01:16:35.437 --> 01:16:36.270
MATT: You have two more questions.

1930
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:37.239
TALIESIN: I know that's three.
LAURA: You have five questions.

1931
01:16:37.239 --> 01:16:39.644
TALIESIN: I have five?
SAM: Five?

1932
01:16:39.644 --> 01:16:40.720
TRAVIS: Were they coming for the orb?

1933
01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.300
or were they coming for me?

1934
01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.633
TALIESIN: A reward for what?

1935
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.588
MATT: "Allegiance."

1936
01:16:52.888 --> 01:16:54.738
TALIESIN: Were you following the orb,

1937
01:16:54.738 --> 01:16:56.696
or the one who carried it?

1938
01:16:57.972 --> 01:16:59.801
MATT: "Yes."

1939
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:00.967
MARISHA: Fuck.

1940
01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.859
SAM: Dead people are the worst.

1941
01:17:05.859 --> 01:17:07.565
TALIESIN: Well, that's no help--
MATT: A bit of froth

1942
01:17:07.565 --> 01:17:09.732
stumbles out of the mouth.

1943
01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:12.440
TALIESIN: Decompose.

1944
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.957
ASHLEY: Decompose.
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out.

1945
01:17:16.062 --> 01:17:17.914
MATT: It's Caduceus's version of "talk to the hand"?

1946
01:17:17.914 --> 01:17:19.580
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1947
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.400
TALIESIN: I'll toss that one over in a minute.

1948
01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.327
LAURA: Do you think those fish people were, like, fiends?

1949
01:17:23.327 --> 01:17:26.170
Or do you think they were just like,

1950
01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:28.133
just regular old creatures?

1951
01:17:28.133 --> 01:17:29.499
TRAVIS: Should we ask them, like,

1952
01:17:29.499 --> 01:17:32.415
do they have a headquarters?

1953
01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:36.195
SAM: Where do they come from?
TRAVIS: Congregate? Yeah.

1954
01:17:36.195 --> 01:17:38.350
SAM: Where did they go to commune with--

1955
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:39.978
I'm not going to say the name.

1956
01:17:39.978 --> 01:17:43.190
TALIESIN: I'll find out also, I think will ask also if

1957
01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.107
they know who you were?

1958
01:17:47.561 --> 01:17:48.720
If that makes sense.

1959
01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.860
Or if they just--
TRAVIS: I would say yes,

1960
01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.810
because I had it, but maybe you can ask, like, if,

1961
01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:56.005
if he didn't have it anymore.

1962
01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:58.846
Were you still going to need him?

1963
01:17:58.846 --> 01:18:01.707
SAM: It's a little complicated.
TRAVIS: Well, they're dead.

1964
01:18:01.707 --> 01:18:04.110
(laughter)

1965
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:06.693
MATT: So the goliath and the human.

1966
01:18:09.302 --> 01:18:10.894
TALIESIN: Which one's the leader, is it the--?

1967
01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:12.102
MATT: The leader would be the human man.

1968
01:18:12.102 --> 01:18:14.190
TALIESIN: So let's start with the goliath, then.

1969
01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.281
MATT: All right.

1970
01:18:15.281 --> 01:18:20.074
The thin, but very tall,

1971
01:18:20.074 --> 01:18:22.830
half-giant figure's brought into the center,

1972
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:26.090
placed where you had previously set the ritual

1973
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:29.314
and sits there lifeless, jaw open.

1974
01:18:29.314 --> 01:18:33.486
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh no, not the open mouth.

1975
01:18:33.486 --> 01:18:36.405
MATT: (growling)

1976
01:18:36.405 --> 01:18:38.347
TALIESIN: I'm going to prop the head up in my hand.

1977
01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:40.047
TRAVIS: Terrible, terrible.

1978
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:44.078
MATT: Tongue lolls out a bit.

1979
01:18:45.978 --> 01:18:50.961
TALIESIN: Where do the disciples of Uk'otoa congregate?

1980
01:18:52.642 --> 01:18:56.942
MATT: "Wherever there's water."

1981
01:19:01.941 --> 01:19:06.660
TALIESIN: Do you know the name of the bearer of the orb?

1982
01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.623
MATT: "Maybe."

1983
01:19:09.623 --> 01:19:10.456
SAM: Maybe?

1984
01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:16.200
LAURA: They can lie to you.
TRAVIS: Oh.

1985
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.660
TALIESIN: Uk'otoa.
SAM and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

1986
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:20.290
TALIESIN: Demands honesty.

1987
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:25.448
Tell me the name of the orb bearer.

1988
01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:33.163
MATT: "I don't know your face,

1989
01:19:33.639 --> 01:19:37.814
"I say what

1990
01:19:37.814 --> 01:19:40.022
"I wish."

1991
01:19:41.058 --> 01:19:42.800
TRAVIS: Do you still look like Avantika?

1992
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.633
SAM: Yeah.

1993
01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.847
Ask what color the fire would be,

1994
01:19:46.847 --> 01:19:48.330
if we through the orb in the lava?

1995
01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:51.247
(laughter)

1996
01:19:52.557 --> 01:19:54.050
TALIESIN: How long have you been a follower

1997
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:55.883
of Uk'otoa?
SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

1998
01:19:59.009 --> 01:20:00.509
MATT: "Not long enough."

1999
01:20:02.891 --> 01:20:04.130
LAURA: This guy sucks,

2000
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:05.600
this guy sucks!
MARISHA: Asshole!

2001
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.433
SAM: He's the worst.

2002
01:20:06.433 --> 01:20:11.070
TRAVIS: What happens if Uk'otoa can't retrieve the orb?

2003
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:12.528
SAM: You'll find out.

2004
01:20:12.528 --> 01:20:16.074
(laughter)

2005
01:20:16.074 --> 01:20:18.930
TALIESIN: Has Uk'otoa been released?

2006
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:19.810
MATT: "Soon."

2007
01:20:21.730 --> 01:20:22.563
LAURA: He hasn't.

2008
01:20:23.843 --> 01:20:26.963
That guy sucked.
SAM: That guy was the worst.

2009
01:20:26.963 --> 01:20:28.315
LAURA: What a dick!

2010
01:20:28.315 --> 01:20:30.865
MARISHA: Like talking to Shelda, ugh.

2011
01:20:30.865 --> 01:20:31.730
SAM: Oh yeah.

2012
01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:33.420
MATT: "I'm right here."

2013
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:35.160
MARISHA: Oh, hey Shelda, sorry.

2014
01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.230
TALIESIN: Last one if you want it.

2015
01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:38.030
SAM: Wait, do you want to change your appearance

2016
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:40.687
to make yourself more imposing?

2017
01:20:40.687 --> 01:20:42.097
LAURA: Make yourself look like one of the fish people!

2018
01:20:42.097 --> 01:20:43.850
SAM: Make yourself look like Fjord.

2019
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:45.635
LAURA: Make yourself--
TALIESIN: It won't talk to Fjord.

2020
01:20:45.635 --> 01:20:48.260
LAURA: Look like one of them--
SAM: Fjord is a follower,

2021
01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.351
or was.
LAURA: The bad guys.

2022
01:20:49.351 --> 01:20:51.180
TRAVIS: You could try and make yourself look like Vandran.

2023
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.410
TALIESIN: I could, if I could do this more than once a day.

2024
01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:54.243
LAURA: I could do it.

2025
01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:00.223
TALIESIN: Yeah, sure.

2026
01:21:03.113 --> 01:21:05.104
LIAM, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: (fast tongue lolling)

2027
01:21:05.104 --> 01:21:08.144
TALIESIN: If someone wants to do that,
then I'm okay with that,

2028
01:21:08.144 --> 01:21:09.680
but I don't think I should look like you.

2029
01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.080
I think that would be a very bad idea.

2030
01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.326
LAURA: What if we just looked like--

2031
01:21:14.326 --> 01:21:16.010
LIAM: This elven woman?

2032
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:18.470
TRAVIS: You could.
I don't have any objections to looking like me.

2033
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:19.800
Why would that be bad?

2034
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.180
TALIESIN: If I were a follower of Uk'otoa,

2035
01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.650
why would I tell you anything?

2036
01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:24.280
SAM: Because you could lie to them

2037
01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.590
say, "It worked, you killed me.

2038
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.005
"I'm now a follower, also."

2039
01:21:29.005 --> 01:21:30.180
I don't know, you could just lie.

2040
01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:32.310
TALIESIN: If I said that to you,
would you believe any of it?

2041
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:33.420
SAM: You're very convincing.

2042
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:34.480
TALIESIN: I'm not that convincing.

2043
01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.280
TRAVIS: Can you roll a deception check against a dead?

2044
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.754
MATT: You can.

2045
01:21:38.754 --> 01:21:41.230
If there's grounds for deceiving, yeah.

2046
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:44.249
TALIESIN: Usually finding from a friendly face is the best--

2047
01:21:44.249 --> 01:21:45.867
TRAVIS: How's your deception modifier?

2048
01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.520
MATT: Unfortunately, that was not a face recognized

2049
01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.590
by the individuals.

2050
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:51.710
SAM: What about if you show them the orb?

2051
01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:53.737
TALIESIN: I think that would be a mind-bendingly bad idea.

2052
01:21:53.737 --> 01:21:54.820
SAM: That be like,

2053
01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.934
"I'll give this to you if you answer my question."

2054
01:21:56.934 --> 01:21:59.010
MARISHA: Well, you know, they ran with this crew.

2055
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.770
Why not just make yourself look like the other woman?

2056
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:04.100
LIAM: Yeah, the elven woman and brainstorm

2057
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.460
with this last one about what to do next.

2058
01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.934
TALIESIN: Well, if someone wants to do that--

2059
01:22:08.934 --> 01:22:11.010
MARISHA: Maybe you pretend to be him.

2060
01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:12.330
TALIESIN: If someone wants to do that,

2061
01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:14.640
that's fine I--
TRAVIS: Jester, you could do that.

2062
01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.940
LAURA: Sure.

2063
01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:19.670
LIAM: Is the elven woman who--
LAURA: I will make myself look like

2064
01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:22.135
the--
TALIESIN: Oh, you need to make me,

2065
01:22:22.135 --> 01:22:24.066
because they won't talk to you.

2066
01:22:24.066 --> 01:22:25.651
LAURA: Oh, I was going to Speak with Dead.

2067
01:22:25.651 --> 01:22:28.234
TALIESIN: Oh, then you do it, go ahead.

2068
01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:30.720
LIAM: I pull out the pearl

2069
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.560
and place it against Jester's forehead

2070
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.540
and spend a moment making geometric shapes,

2071
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.017
sprinkle around her head.

2072
01:22:38.017 --> 01:22:40.170
So, you know, for lying to the dead.

2073
01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:41.503
LAURA: Okay, okay.

2074
01:22:41.503 --> 01:22:43.506
What am I asking her?

2075
01:22:43.506 --> 01:22:44.380
SAM: Good question.

2076
01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:47.210
LIAM: Well, let's talk it out.

2077
01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:48.835
They came to get Fjord.

2078
01:22:48.835 --> 01:22:52.340
You're talking to, presumably, your leader?

2079
01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.298
LAURA: Yeah.

2080
01:22:53.298 --> 01:22:55.655
TALIESIN: We don't know if they
came to get Fjord or the orb.

2081
01:22:55.655 --> 01:22:57.430
If they who Fjord is.
LIAM: We need both.

2082
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:59.847
LIAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: We don't know.

2083
01:23:01.216 --> 01:23:03.330
MARISHA: We still haven't gotten the question answered,

2084
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:06.393
on if they needed Fjord alive.

2085
01:23:06.393 --> 01:23:07.373
LAURA: Okay.

2086
01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:09.760
SAM: Are more coming, maybe?

2087
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.926
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to be like,

2088
01:23:10.926 --> 01:23:13.872
"Oh man, everyone got killed,

2089
01:23:13.872 --> 01:23:15.705
"except for me."

2090
01:23:15.705 --> 01:23:16.780
LIAM: The target got away.

2091
01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.970
LAURA: The target got away.
LIAM: What should we do next?

2092
01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:20.630
LAURA: Do we have the reinforcements coming?

2093
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:21.838
Should I go after him,

2094
01:23:21.838 --> 01:23:23.180
or should they go after the orb?

2095
01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.680
They threw the orb away! Should they go after?

2096
01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.513
No, does that mean--

2097
01:23:26.513 --> 01:23:28.561
LIAM: What should we do next, fearless leader?

2098
01:23:28.561 --> 01:23:30.085
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: The dead

2099
01:23:30.085 --> 01:23:33.026
can't really-- they're not that bright either.

2100
01:23:33.026 --> 01:23:37.271
So they're-- making them think complex thoughts

2101
01:23:37.271 --> 01:23:41.038
doesn't often go very well.
LAURA: Okay, so I should just be like--

2102
01:23:41.038 --> 01:23:42.747
LIAM: I don't know what to do without you,

2103
01:23:42.747 --> 01:23:43.830
who should I go to?

2104
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:45.240
What is our next move?

2105
01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.973
LAURA: Yeah, they used to-- I can't remember anything.

2106
01:23:48.973 --> 01:23:51.900
Tell me where I'm supposed to go now?

2107
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.681
Okay, cool.

2108
01:23:53.681 --> 01:23:56.681
All right, I'm going to Disguise Self

2109
01:23:57.970 --> 01:23:59.800
as the elven woman.
MATT: Okay.

2110
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:02.340
LAURA: You know what makes me?

2111
01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.120
I wonder-- I'm already the elven woman.

2112
01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.978
I wonder if--

2113
01:24:06.978 --> 01:24:11.620
how long they were the creatures?

2114
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.540
Have they been like that for a long time?

2115
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:16.010
Or did they change at will?

2116
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:17.720
TALIESIN: That's a good question, I bet

2117
01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.689
they were like creatures--
LAURA: For along time?

2118
01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:21.764
TALIESIN: Probably for a long time.

2119
01:24:21.764 --> 01:24:24.468
LAURA: So I probably should've made my self look like.

2120
01:24:24.468 --> 01:24:26.693
TALIESIN: Yeah, you probably should've like
blah, blah, blah.

2121
01:24:26.693 --> 01:24:28.184
It's probably an easier voice.
LAURA: Did they speak?

2122
01:24:28.184 --> 01:24:29.759
Could they talk?
TRAVIS: Can you do the Mercer sound?

2123
01:24:29.759 --> 01:24:31.665
Can you do (staccato hissing)?
TALIESIN: They made a lot of--

2124
01:24:31.665 --> 01:24:32.956
LAURA: (staccato hissing)

2125
01:24:32.956 --> 01:24:35.140
MATT: There you go!

2126
01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:37.730
TALIESIN: Were they talking?

2127
01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.326
LAURA: I don't know. I'm just going to be the elven woman,

2128
01:24:39.326 --> 01:24:40.865
because fuck it, I already did it.

2129
01:24:40.865 --> 01:24:41.856
SAM: Great.

2130
01:24:41.856 --> 01:24:44.180
MARISHA: They were saying commands to each other,

2131
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.007
Weren't they?

2132
01:24:46.007 --> 01:24:47.880
Do I remember them saying commands to each other?

2133
01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.862
MATT: They were communicating.
LIAM: But they were doing

2134
01:24:49.862 --> 01:24:50.770
fish sounds.
MARISHA: Were they speaking in Common,

2135
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:52.402
or they were speaking the fish sounds, right?

2136
01:24:52.402 --> 01:24:54.216
LIAM: They were Predator talking.

2137
01:24:54.216 --> 01:24:55.940
LAURA: All right, I'm going to Speak with Dead

2138
01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:58.740
on the, what is it, the goliath guy?

2139
01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.573
SAM: On the leader?
TALIESIN: The human.

2140
01:24:59.573 --> 01:25:00.540
SAM: On the leader.
LIAM: No, the human.

2141
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:02.037
LAURA: That's the one that haven't talked to yet.

2142
01:25:02.037 --> 01:25:03.679
LIAM: The one that we chopped up.
LAURA: The one we chopped up?

2143
01:25:03.679 --> 01:25:04.512
LIAM: Yeah.

2144
01:25:04.512 --> 01:25:05.943
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2145
01:25:05.943 --> 01:25:09.140
Good thing I'm not looking like myself, okay.

2146
01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.890
Cast Speak with Dead.

2147
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.011
MATT: Okay, so the final,

2148
01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:19.431
the human man as you reach forward

2149
01:25:19.431 --> 01:25:21.741
and finished the completion of the spell on it

2150
01:25:21.741 --> 01:25:23.890
you can see one of the eyes,

2151
01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:25.640
because one of the eyes is damaged

2152
01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.618
and ruined from the battle.

2153
01:25:27.618 --> 01:25:30.001
The other one like (slurping).

2154
01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:31.530
LAURA: Fjord should definitely, like, be away from

2155
01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:32.363
(mumbling).

2156
01:25:32.363 --> 01:25:33.451
TRAVIS: What did you say, come over there?

2157
01:25:33.451 --> 01:25:34.680
LAURA: Don't, no, no.

2158
01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:38.813
MATT: Okay.

2159
01:25:38.813 --> 01:25:41.006
MARISHA: (giggling)

2160
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:43.223
LAURA: Oh my gosh,

2161
01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:46.167
they really fucked up your body!

2162
01:25:46.167 --> 01:25:48.642
(laughter)

2163
01:25:48.642 --> 01:25:49.475
Ooh!

2164
01:25:50.467 --> 01:25:53.134
MATT: The eye's just looking at you.

2165
01:25:54.194 --> 01:25:57.611
LAURA: Well, that battle did not go well, huh?

2166
01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:03.110
Looks like, we got defeated and they got away,

2167
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.326
but

2168
01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:08.518
what do we do now,

2169
01:26:09.885 --> 01:26:10.718
leader?

2170
01:26:11.662 --> 01:26:13.990
MATT: Roll a deception check.

2171
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:16.066
SAM: (imitating Laura) "Oh, what do we do now?"

2172
01:26:16.066 --> 01:26:17.445
(laughter)

2173
01:26:17.445 --> 01:26:19.304
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (imitating Laura) What?

2174
01:26:21.762 --> 01:26:23.062
TRAVIS: Look at your pretty star necklace.

2175
01:26:23.062 --> 01:26:24.270
LAURA: Guide me, guide me.

2176
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:26.110
TALIESIN: It's too late for that.
LAURA: No, it's not. Guide me!

2177
01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:27.360
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Shit!

2178
01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:29.643
Oh.

2179
01:26:31.074 --> 01:26:33.124
MATT: That was a very Stanley Spadowski reaction of you.

2180
01:26:33.124 --> 01:26:34.881
LAURA: That was really good!

2181
01:26:34.881 --> 01:26:37.229
That was 23.

2182
01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:39.597
MATT: 23.

2183
01:26:39.597 --> 01:26:40.430
TALIESIN: She found the marble in the oatmeal.

2184
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:43.597
MATT: She found the marble in the oatmeal.

2185
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:53.260
"Speak with him

2186
01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.660
"for guidance."

2187
01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:57.695
LAURA: That's a good idea,

2188
01:26:57.695 --> 01:27:01.278
I don't know why I didn't think that first.

2189
01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.855
So I got hit in the head pretty hard in that fight.

2190
01:27:06.855 --> 01:27:08.930
I can't remember if we're supposed to follow

2191
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:13.430
the orb now or I was supposed to follow the green guy?

2192
01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:16.593
MATT: "One and the same."

2193
01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.279
LAURA: But not if the orb can get out of the guy, huh?

2194
01:27:21.279 --> 01:27:23.196
which is what happened.

2195
01:27:25.513 --> 01:27:26.960
Where should I go?

2196
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.150
What should I do?

2197
01:27:28.150 --> 01:27:29.490
Should I keep going after the guy?

2198
01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:34.138
MATT: "Find the betrayer!"

2199
01:27:34.138 --> 01:27:36.408
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

2200
01:27:36.408 --> 01:27:37.761
LIAM: That's you, Tarv.

2201
01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.050
LAURA: Okay, good idea.

2202
01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.480
And then once I get him,

2203
01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:50.480
I'm going to take him back to the temple close by.

2204
01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.473
Maybe.

2205
01:27:51.473 --> 01:27:52.678
Is that where we should take him?

2206
01:27:52.678 --> 01:27:55.969
MATT: "(drawn out) Yes.

2207
01:27:55.969 --> 01:28:00.610
"The final seal."

2208
01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:03.443
MARISHA: The final seal.

2209
01:28:05.392 --> 01:28:07.155
LAURA: Should I ask him anything else?

2210
01:28:07.155 --> 01:28:10.036
SAM: I mean, you got one question, you might as well.

2211
01:28:10.036 --> 01:28:11.045
Are you pooping?

2212
01:28:11.045 --> 01:28:14.045
LAURA: I mean--
TRAVIS: What does Uk'otoa fear the most?

2213
01:28:15.315 --> 01:28:18.310
Maybe that's a shit question.

2214
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:19.143
LAURA: Yeah, so.

2215
01:28:20.608 --> 01:28:22.730
Our god, man.

2216
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:25.115
He's pretty scared of that green guy, huh.

2217
01:28:25.115 --> 01:28:26.937
Is he super scared of him?

2218
01:28:26.937 --> 01:28:28.634
What is he scared of the most?

2219
01:28:28.634 --> 01:28:31.520
(laughter)

2220
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.360
SAM: What are his weaknesses?

2221
01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.731
TALIESIN: Strongbad wants to know.

2222
01:28:36.731 --> 01:28:39.847
MATT: "I can't

2223
01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:44.455
"contemplate something

2224
01:28:44.455 --> 01:28:48.168
"far more than-- (groaning)"

2225
01:28:48.168 --> 01:28:50.750
(laughter)

2226
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:51.700
TALIESIN: And Decompose..

2227
01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.410
LAURA: I really wanted to show him that I

2228
01:28:53.410 --> 01:28:55.070
wasn't actually the elven chick at the end there.

2229
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:56.430
SAM: You were so good!

2230
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:58.240
LAURA: Oh my god, he totally bought it!

2231
01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.940
SAM: Yeah! So that's the trick, then,

2232
01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:01.530
we have to play dumb with dead people.

2233
01:29:01.530 --> 01:29:04.372
LAURA: I'm going to switch back to myself.
MATT: Okay.

2234
01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:06.759
TALIESIN: Okay, they're just not real.
SAM: Wow!

2235
01:29:06.759 --> 01:29:08.382
TALIESIN: And they're now fish food.
LAURA: They were going after you,

2236
01:29:08.382 --> 01:29:10.532
Fjord, they wanted you: the betrayer.

2237
01:29:10.532 --> 01:29:11.540
MATT: (splashing)

2238
01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.950
MARISHA: And they also want him to open up the last seal.

2239
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:16.783
SAM: Wow.

2240
01:29:17.887 --> 01:29:19.500
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression

2241
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:22.010
this is probably going to happen
every time we get on a boat.

2242
01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:23.610
TRAVIS: This was a success.

2243
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:25.760
I feel rejuvenated and enthused.

2244
01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.463
SAM: You got rid of the ball.

2245
01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:29.640
TRAVIS: Yep, no problem.

2246
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.010
SAM: We know that they're searching for you still

2247
01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:34.800
and we need to protect you at all costs.

2248
01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.113
TRAVIS: I feel like if we just tied a little flag

2249
01:29:37.113 --> 01:29:38.410
and a bell to the sphere,

2250
01:29:38.410 --> 01:29:39.960
just, like, throw it over the side of the boat

2251
01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.569
we could just fish with it.

2252
01:29:42.569 --> 01:29:44.540
Wouldn't really worry about me so much.

2253
01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.865
SAM: Maybe.
LAURA: Hmm.

2254
01:29:45.865 --> 01:29:47.089
TRAVIS: No?
LAURA: They'd come and get it

2255
01:29:47.089 --> 01:29:48.344
and then Uk'otoa would be released

2256
01:29:48.344 --> 01:29:50.806
and then we'd all have to fight the giant--
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression

2257
01:29:50.806 --> 01:29:53.600
that the Uk'otoa really wants to find you, too.

2258
01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.016
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

2259
01:29:55.016 --> 01:29:57.020
TALIESIN: Traitor's not a nickname you--
LAURA: We just need

2260
01:29:57.020 --> 01:30:00.396
to be prepared to have a fight
every single night before we go to sleep.

2261
01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:02.347
LIAM: Pretty much, yeah.
TRAVIS: No fucking way!

2262
01:30:02.347 --> 01:30:05.709
TALIESIN: Just have to string up the ship and--

2263
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:08.461
ASHLEY: Well, now would be prepared for it, you know?

2264
01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:10.742
TRAVIS: Should we try and ally ourselves

2265
01:30:10.742 --> 01:30:11.700
with one of the other ships?

2266
01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.134
Just work out what would we say?

2267
01:30:14.134 --> 01:30:14.967
LAURA: We should tell Essek.

2268
01:30:14.967 --> 01:30:15.800
TRAVIS: We're still going to be attacked,

2269
01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.460
every night, by a bunch of fish people.

2270
01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.280
SAM: We might not be attacked <i>every</i> night.

2271
01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.840
I mean they-- it's going to take-- we killed all of those,

2272
01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.940
so it'll take time for word to get back, right?
LIAM: How many days are we out from the--?

2273
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.008
MATT: This is the fifth day-- you guys.

2274
01:30:29.008 --> 01:30:30.640
Depending on how long the storm lasts,

2275
01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.450
it can be anywhere between another

2276
01:30:34.034 --> 01:30:37.107
four to six days.

2277
01:30:37.107 --> 01:30:38.457
You'll have to gauge it as the weather comes.

2278
01:30:38.457 --> 01:30:41.523
TALIESIN: I'm going to ask the Wildmother to end the storm.

2279
01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:43.653
LAURA: Ooh.
MATT: Are you going to try again?

2280
01:30:43.653 --> 01:30:44.869
TALIESIN: I mean it's a new day.

2281
01:30:44.869 --> 01:30:46.452
MATT: Okay.

2282
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:48.323
TALIESIN: 74.

2283
01:30:48.323 --> 01:30:49.370
No, I don't think that works.

2284
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:51.251
MATT: Ah, sorry.
TALIESIN: Nah, it's okay.

2285
01:30:51.251 --> 01:30:53.060
It's the Hail Mary.

2286
01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:56.100
SAM: Are the other ships going full steam ahead?

2287
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:56.933
Full mast?

2288
01:30:56.933 --> 01:30:59.370
MATT: They're all going as quickly as the slowest ship.

2289
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:01.244
So it's not extremely quickly.

2290
01:31:01.244 --> 01:31:02.340
Because they're all traveling,

2291
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.340
but they're also traveling in a formation

2292
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:06.350
to be ready for any sort of attack

2293
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:08.865
or assault that were to transpire on a mass scale,

2294
01:31:08.865 --> 01:31:11.270
towards the ships that are in the center of the armada,

2295
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:15.193
which are the Winds of Aeons and the Blue Heaven,

2296
01:31:15.193 --> 01:31:17.650
those that are transporting the artifact

2297
01:31:17.650 --> 01:31:21.892
and the prisoner for this negotiation.

2298
01:31:21.892 --> 01:31:23.330
So all of rest of the ships have encircled and

2299
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:25.452
they all travel at a continued pace.

2300
01:31:25.452 --> 01:31:27.667
You guys are on the outskirts in the back right.

2301
01:31:27.667 --> 01:31:29.858
TRAVIS: Did we ever [inaudible]?

2302
01:31:29.858 --> 01:31:31.190
SAM: No.

2303
01:31:31.190 --> 01:31:32.180
TRAVIS: We don't know who the prisoner is?

2304
01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.846
Is it prisoner? Or prisoners?

2305
01:31:33.846 --> 01:31:35.040
MATT: The prisoner is Vence.

2306
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.306
LAURA: Vence, yeah.
LIAM: Blondie.

2307
01:31:36.306 --> 01:31:38.821
TRAVIS: Sorry.
MARISHA: They're going to be trading.

2308
01:31:38.821 --> 01:31:40.871
TALIESIN: As long as the two of us look forward,

2309
01:31:40.871 --> 01:31:41.704
we should be--
MATT: Yeah.

2310
01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:44.048
Nah, I'm giving you a break.
TRAVIS: I'm re-uploading from the cloud.

2311
01:31:44.048 --> 01:31:46.014
MATT: That's okay.
(laughter)

2312
01:31:46.014 --> 01:31:47.297
TRAVIS: New phone, who dis?

2313
01:31:47.297 --> 01:31:48.910
MARISHA: Do not unplug your phone during this time.

2314
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:50.835
LIAM: Veth is correct;

2315
01:31:50.835 --> 01:31:52.980
we need to be ready every single night.

2316
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:54.166
It won't be every single night.

2317
01:31:54.166 --> 01:31:56.838
It might not be at all, but we need to be ready.

2318
01:31:56.838 --> 01:31:58.660
And I think it is likely,

2319
01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.580
that if they come back,

2320
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:04.323
It will be more than the first time.

2321
01:32:04.323 --> 01:32:05.573
TRAVIS: That's true.
LIAM: They will learn from their mistakes

2322
01:32:05.573 --> 01:32:09.219
and see that we were able to handle ourselves.

2323
01:32:09.219 --> 01:32:11.700
SAM: Well, that might be it for a while.

2324
01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:14.567
TRAVIS: Right. Maybe we should try
and moor next to the other ships.

2325
01:32:14.567 --> 01:32:17.585
LIAM: Hope for the best, expect the worst.

2326
01:32:17.585 --> 01:32:19.420
SAM: Well, we should continue repairs on the ship

2327
01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:22.424
and just keep plowing ahead as fast as we can.

2328
01:32:22.424 --> 01:32:25.080
MATT: Okay, all righty. (die roll)
TRAVIS: Agreed.

2329
01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.988
MARISHA: Caleb, are you going to take this

2330
01:32:27.988 --> 01:32:29.971
Vess DeRogna?
TRAVIS: Did you just roll dice?

2331
01:32:29.971 --> 01:32:31.146
MATT: Hmm?
TRAVIS: Did you just roll dice?

2332
01:32:31.146 --> 01:32:32.337
MATT: (negative) Mm-mm.

2333
01:32:32.337 --> 01:32:34.868
MARISHA: Are you going to take her
up on wanting to talk with her?

2334
01:32:34.868 --> 01:32:38.665
Is that something we're actually going to do right now?

2335
01:32:38.665 --> 01:32:42.860
LIAM: Well, she asked us if we wanted work in the north.

2336
01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:46.607
But we are far too busy at the moment to accept any work.

2337
01:32:46.607 --> 01:32:48.973
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: (giggling)

2338
01:32:48.973 --> 01:32:53.973
MARISHA: I mean, beyond us accepting
work out of being too busy,

2339
01:32:54.301 --> 01:32:58.017
wouldn't we want to avoid working for Vess DeRogna?

2340
01:32:58.017 --> 01:33:01.632
LIAM: We are not working for Vess DeRogna.

2341
01:33:01.632 --> 01:33:03.382
MARISHA: I know, I'm asking.

2342
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:07.660
LIAM: Yeah--
TRAVIS: Can I summon

2343
01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:10.170
the sword and cast See Invisibility?

2344
01:33:10.170 --> 01:33:12.725
MATT: Sure. Summon the sword.

2345
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:17.697
TRAVIS: Any orbs--
MATT: Roll a perception check.

2346
01:33:25.710 --> 01:33:27.050
TRAVIS: 12.
MATT: Okay.

2347
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:29.690
At the moment, you do not see any orbs

2348
01:33:29.690 --> 01:33:32.940
any sort of scrying beacons around you.

2349
01:33:35.068 --> 01:33:36.303
TALIESIN: I think it's not insane to at least tell

2350
01:33:36.303 --> 01:33:38.900
Vess DeRogna what we know now.

2351
01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:40.308
I mean, we know it.

2352
01:33:40.308 --> 01:33:42.022
I don't see what the harm of just letting

2353
01:33:42.022 --> 01:33:44.150
them know that we know what's up.

2354
01:33:44.150 --> 01:33:46.825
LIAM: That is complicated.
SAM: Super complicated.

2355
01:33:46.825 --> 01:33:48.070
MARISHA: Yeah, how do you mean know?

2356
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:49.750
Let them know what?

2357
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:53.550
TALIESIN: That it was a cult of a

2358
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.323
sea god that's got a--

2359
01:33:57.323 --> 01:33:58.756
SAM: A grudge against us.
TALIESIN: Grudge against one of our people.

2360
01:33:58.756 --> 01:34:00.550
SAM: What would that benefit us though?

2361
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:01.383
LAURA: Yeah.

2362
01:34:01.383 --> 01:34:02.290
SAM: They'll just be like,

2363
01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:04.070
"Oh great, well then don't follow

2364
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:07.880
"us any more in formation. You're making us unsafe."

2365
01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.190
TALIESIN: I mean, I can't imagine that half the people

2366
01:34:10.190 --> 01:34:12.560
in this group don't have weird stuff like that.

2367
01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.293
LAURA: Yeah, but they're not telling anyone else.

2368
01:34:14.293 --> 01:34:15.587
MARISHA: Exactly.

2369
01:34:15.587 --> 01:34:18.305
TALIESIN: I mean--
MARISHA: Everyone's got their shit.

2370
01:34:18.305 --> 01:34:20.971
And you keep it on lockdown, man.

2371
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:23.312
TALIESIN: Well.

2372
01:34:23.312 --> 01:34:25.930
You're not worried that no one's talking to anybody else?

2373
01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:29.660
LIAM: Well, I am worried, Caduceus,
but we are gambling a bit here.

2374
01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.390
If we let them know that there is

2375
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:35.669
an all-powerful monstrosity under the ocean that is going

2376
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:40.127
to stop at nothing to unleash itself by murdering us.

2377
01:34:40.127 --> 01:34:42.190
Probably the peace talks will be called off.

2378
01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:43.223
TALIESIN: That's fair.
LAURA: Man, you slowed

2379
01:34:43.223 --> 01:34:44.550
that guy for a while, dude, that's crazy.

2380
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:45.560
TALIESIN: I'm just going to find out,

2381
01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:48.030
they were they were surprisingly chill about

2382
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:49.793
the last time this happened.
TRAVIS: How many people are

2383
01:34:49.793 --> 01:34:52.010
actively repairing the boat?

2384
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.843
Just one?

2385
01:34:52.843 --> 01:34:54.090
TALIESIN: I'll go with what the group thinks.

2386
01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:57.541
MATT: Well, you have Gallan is the carpenter assigned.

2387
01:34:57.541 --> 01:34:59.299
The other carpenter is Jester, so currently

2388
01:34:59.299 --> 01:35:00.870
it's just Gallant
LAURA: I'll go, fine, I understand

2389
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:01.703
what you're saying.

2390
01:35:01.703 --> 01:35:03.550
LAURA: I'm going to go out (mumbling).
TRAVIS: Jester, take someone

2391
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:06.320
with you and also someone go help Gallan.

2392
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.184
I just had a horrible thought

2393
01:35:07.184 --> 01:35:08.691
that maybe since these humanoids

2394
01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:10.245
could turn into those things.

2395
01:35:10.245 --> 01:35:11.435
I just don't want to make sure

2396
01:35:11.435 --> 01:35:13.220
we have some Black Pearl thing happening

2397
01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.930
and some fucking ship comes up out of the ocean.

2398
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:16.313
SAM and TALIESIN: I don't know what that means.

2399
01:35:16.313 --> 01:35:17.146
TRAVIS: Like a black pearl,

2400
01:35:17.146 --> 01:35:18.839
you've never seen a black pearl before?

2401
01:35:18.839 --> 01:35:21.178
Comes up out of the ocean turns into a ship

2402
01:35:21.178 --> 01:35:25.076
and then we're fighting, like, an undead sea person ship.

2403
01:35:25.076 --> 01:35:26.309
TALIESIN: Is this a real thing?

2404
01:35:26.309 --> 01:35:28.884
TRAVIS: I don't know, I just vomited a ball,

2405
01:35:28.884 --> 01:35:29.984
what do you want from me?

2406
01:35:29.984 --> 01:35:31.775
MARISHA: It's true.

2407
01:35:31.775 --> 01:35:32.630
LAURA: I'm going to go.
SAM: You want us to go

2408
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:33.510
check out on Gallan?

2409
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:34.446
LAURA: Yeah.

2410
01:35:34.446 --> 01:35:35.680
TRAVIS: Just start working on the ship

2411
01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.729
just in case, we're all healed.

2412
01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:40.160
I don't know if ol' Balleater is.

2413
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.590
LAURA: We're going to fix the ship.

2414
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:42.510
MATT: All right.

2415
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:44.380
Gallan's done quite a bit. Gallan's currently sleeping,

2416
01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:46.820
because Gallan was up all night doing repairs.

2417
01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.310
LAURA: I'll start where he left off and keep going.

2418
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:50.143
MATT: So you continue going.

2419
01:35:50.143 --> 01:35:51.547
No worries.
SAM: I'll supervise.

2420
01:35:51.547 --> 01:35:52.580
LAURA: Don't supervise me.

2421
01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.930
SAM: I'm the cannon master.

2422
01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:56.630
LAURA: I'm an equal with you.

2423
01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:58.458
SAM: Yeah, but I'm in charge of the cannons.

2424
01:35:58.458 --> 01:36:01.270
LAURA: Then look at your cannons while I look at this wood.

2425
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:03.260
TALIESIN: Cannons are kind of scraped up, I might add.

2426
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:04.093
SAM: Yeah, I'll--

2427
01:36:04.093 --> 01:36:06.480
LAURA: Yeah, fix those cannons, somebody fucked them up.

2428
01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.210
SAM: I'll like--
TALIESIN: Polish your cannons?

2429
01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:11.507
SAM: Sand and polish the cannon metal. (chuckles)

2430
01:36:11.507 --> 01:36:15.053
SAM: Let me tell you, sanding iron:
it's a great use of your time.

2431
01:36:15.053 --> 01:36:17.599
(laughter)

2432
01:36:17.599 --> 01:36:19.212
SAM: Then I'll stop after five minutes

2433
01:36:19.212 --> 01:36:20.970
and start working on other stuff.

2434
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:23.050
MATT: You feel accomplished.

2435
01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:24.650
Sure, sure.
TRAVIS: (like Veth) My hand's tired.

2436
01:36:25.533 --> 01:36:26.999
MARISHA: Caleb.
MATT: Day-- Go.

2437
01:36:26.999 --> 01:36:28.960
MARISHA: My point was why would we even want to go

2438
01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.060
talk to Vess DeRogna?

2439
01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:33.440
Beyond us being too busy.

2440
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.930
She's, like, one of the prime

2441
01:36:36.930 --> 01:36:39.742
murderous candidates of the Cerberus Assembly

2442
01:36:39.742 --> 01:36:42.178
LIAM: Yeah, we are on the same page.

2443
01:36:42.178 --> 01:36:43.670
MARISHA: I was just asking if you're going to

2444
01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:44.770
take her up on her offer.

2445
01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:46.008
And you're like, "Well, we're really busy."

2446
01:36:46.008 --> 01:36:47.790
And I was like, "That's not the point, though."

2447
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:49.510
LIAM: Yeah, but Beauregard,

2448
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:53.687
we want to at least create the semblance of cooperation.

2449
01:36:53.687 --> 01:36:56.234
I mean, we don't trust them. They know that.

2450
01:36:56.234 --> 01:36:58.073
They don't trust us. We know that,

2451
01:36:58.073 --> 01:37:02.398
but if there is even a hair of doubt

2452
01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:06.420
in their minds that perhaps

2453
01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:11.338
their empire citizens feel the need

2454
01:37:11.338 --> 01:37:12.660
to cooperate or feel--
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2455
01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.230
LIAM: -- allegiance to country.

2456
01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:16.410
MARISHA: No, I'm with it, it hit.
LIAM: So keep it hazy.

2457
01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:21.402
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just checking in with you, man.

2458
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:25.210
Just want to know what the greater plan was

2459
01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:30.210
on how we were going to do this.

2460
01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:34.680
LIAM: How we're going to turn
these peace talks into actual peace?

2461
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.026
MARISHA: No, you know what? Never mind.

2462
01:37:39.026 --> 01:37:40.927
Think we're on the same page.

2463
01:37:40.927 --> 01:37:42.610
LIAM: Think so?
MARISHA: Yeah.

2464
01:37:44.226 --> 01:37:46.356
Do you want to go talk to Vess DeRogna today or no?

2465
01:37:46.356 --> 01:37:47.197
Because she was like,

2466
01:37:47.197 --> 01:37:49.450
"Oh, we're going to be here on this boat

2467
01:37:49.450 --> 01:37:51.166
"and we got time if you want to, like,

2468
01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:52.800
"come and talk to me.

2469
01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.633
"I'll be here."

2470
01:37:53.633 --> 01:37:56.320
So it was just wondering if that was a plan.

2471
01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.100
But if not, then, like, fuck her.

2472
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.434
LIAM: No, I think sometime in the next few days,

2473
01:38:02.434 --> 01:38:05.662
it would make sense to try to, again,

2474
01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:08.251
put out a show of good faith

2475
01:38:08.251 --> 01:38:10.510
that we are trying to coordinate

2476
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:14.510
and also not wait until the day and see what happens.

2477
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:16.776
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. So, what, tomorrow?
You want to do this shit tomorrow?

2478
01:38:16.776 --> 01:38:19.110
LIAM: Let's go tomorrow.
MARISHA: All right.

2479
01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:19.943
MATT: Okay.

2480
01:38:21.254 --> 01:38:23.212
LIAM: If you wanted

2481
01:38:23.212 --> 01:38:25.054
an escort over to the Cerberus ship

2482
01:38:25.054 --> 01:38:28.481
you could have just asked outright.

2483
01:38:28.481 --> 01:38:32.883
MARISHA: I was just looping you in on a potential plan, man.

2484
01:38:32.883 --> 01:38:35.233
LIAM: All right... man?

2485
01:38:35.233 --> 01:38:36.849
(chuckling)

2486
01:38:36.849 --> 01:38:38.400
And I walk away confused.

2487
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.233
MATT: Okay.

2488
01:38:41.598 --> 01:38:43.797
The rest of the day goes by without issue.

2489
01:38:43.797 --> 01:38:46.797
The storm still maintaining, though not as

2490
01:38:46.797 --> 01:38:48.788
thunderous as the night before.

2491
01:38:48.788 --> 01:38:51.954
The rain is not relenting.

2492
01:38:53.729 --> 01:38:58.256
The evening comes to and you guys are sleeping below deck

2493
01:38:58.256 --> 01:39:01.168
with the same arrangement, I assume.

2494
01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:03.168
LAURA: Ooh, we should put a

2495
01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:07.490
Fjord dummy in the captain's bed.

2496
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:08.323
TRAVIS: A what?

2497
01:39:08.323 --> 01:39:10.044
SAM: A Fjord dummy.

2498
01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:11.460
TRAVIS: Oh, like a decoy.

2499
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:13.250
LAURA: Yeah!
TALIESIN: A Fjord, dummy.

2500
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:15.500
LIAM: I will also send Frumpkin

2501
01:39:16.994 --> 01:39:19.700
the monkey to hang from the rigging

2502
01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.050
of the ship within 100 feet

2503
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:24.420
so that he can tell me if anything is climbing onto deck.

2504
01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:29.234
MATT: Okay, easy enough, pardon me, okay.

2505
01:39:29.234 --> 01:39:30.140
The rest of the day--

2506
01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.200
SAM: We'll take some shirts

2507
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.046
and pants and--
LAURA: Yeah, stuff them.

2508
01:39:33.046 --> 01:39:33.879
SAM: Stuff them with straw.

2509
01:39:33.879 --> 01:39:35.300
LAURA: Put them in the captain's bed.

2510
01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.168
I'm going to paint--
MATT: Massive amount of straw

2511
01:39:37.168 --> 01:39:41.020
that you guys keep below deck of your ship at sea.

2512
01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.457
LAURA: You know.

2513
01:39:42.457 --> 01:39:43.290
SAM: Rags.

2514
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:44.729
LAURA: Rags, some rags.

2515
01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:46.440
MATT: All right, you can find some rags.

2516
01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.420
LAURA: I'm going to-- just the head.

2517
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.130
MATT: Gallan is like, "I didn't need this bedsheets anyway,

2518
01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:51.621
"it's fine."
LIAM: Just put Marius inside.

2519
01:39:51.621 --> 01:39:52.944
(laughter)

2520
01:39:52.944 --> 01:39:56.399
TRAVIS: LePual, did you kill anyone?
Surrender your bedsheets!

2521
01:39:58.033 --> 01:40:01.250
LAURA: I'm going to use my paint--
SAM: Yeah, yep.

2522
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:02.280
LAURA: Thank you.

2523
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.780
To paint a Fjord head.

2524
01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:07.220
That looks like Fjord's head.

2525
01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:08.610
MATT: You're using your magical paints, right?

2526
01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:09.443
LAURA: Yeah.

2527
01:40:09.443 --> 01:40:10.752
SAM: It's going to become a Fjord head?

2528
01:40:10.752 --> 01:40:12.670
LAURA: Well it's not going to be--

2529
01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:13.690
it's not going to come alive,

2530
01:40:13.690 --> 01:40:15.340
but it's going to look like Fjord.

2531
01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.270
MATT: Okay, you finish it

2532
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:18.610
and it looks creepily realistic.

2533
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:20.623
TRAVIS: Wow.

2534
01:40:20.623 --> 01:40:21.456
MATT: It's just Fjord's face going--

2535
01:40:21.456 --> 01:40:23.664
LAURA: Oh, Eric, here.

2536
01:40:23.664 --> 01:40:24.915
(laughter)

2537
01:40:24.915 --> 01:40:26.306
TRAVIS: "Oh, Eric"?

2538
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:29.425
SAM: Are you going to practice making out with it?

2539
01:40:29.425 --> 01:40:30.840
LAURA: No, he's sleeping, it's weird.

2540
01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.650
SAM: All right.
LIAM: It's also just a head.

2541
01:40:32.650 --> 01:40:33.483
LAURA: Yeah.

2542
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:35.933
Well, I put it on the decoy body.

2543
01:40:35.933 --> 01:40:37.384
SAM: Yeah, it's good, it's good.

2544
01:40:37.384 --> 01:40:40.240
MATT: Mark the used paint on it.

2545
01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.001
MARISHA: She has this, just this face.

2546
01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:44.917
It's a little weird when you look back. Yeah.

2547
01:40:44.917 --> 01:40:45.750
MATT: Okay.

2548
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:49.685
LAURA: Fjord, (groaning) okay.

2549
01:40:49.685 --> 01:40:51.979
MATT: The decoy is set.

2550
01:40:51.979 --> 01:40:56.979
You guys complete the sixth evening rest.

2551
01:40:57.273 --> 01:40:58.810
LIAM: Actually, before everyone--

2552
01:40:58.810 --> 01:40:59.643
MATT: Yes.

2553
01:40:59.643 --> 01:41:00.980
LIAM: -- beds down,

2554
01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:05.240
Caleb finds a moment to wander off to Yasha

2555
01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.339
as she's just staring out at the ocean.

2556
01:41:07.339 --> 01:41:09.898
MATT: Two square feet with the back as well.

2557
01:41:10.835 --> 01:41:12.080
LIAM: Hey.
ASHLEY: Hey.

2558
01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.513
LIAM: You're awfully quiet the last day, are you all right?

2559
01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:19.803
ASHLEY: I think so.

2560
01:41:20.982 --> 01:41:22.565
LIAM: What's out there?

2561
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:27.867
ASHLEY: Just watching the storm, I guess.

2562
01:41:29.254 --> 01:41:32.395
Keeping tabs,

2563
01:41:32.395 --> 01:41:35.211
making sure nothing else climbs aboard.

2564
01:41:36.865 --> 01:41:40.080
LIAM: You'll come to bed in a bit, yeah?

2565
01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.247
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

2566
01:41:42.288 --> 01:41:43.455
ASHLEY: How are you?

2567
01:41:45.311 --> 01:41:46.644
LIAM: Oh, very good.

2568
01:41:50.922 --> 01:41:51.755
ASHLEY: I--

2569
01:41:53.625 --> 01:41:55.792
(sighing)

2570
01:41:58.221 --> 01:42:00.888
You know how Fjord said he had

2571
01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:05.610
a dream that he swallowed that ball

2572
01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:08.410
and then it was there?

2573
01:42:08.410 --> 01:42:09.243
LIAM: Yes.

2574
01:42:11.534 --> 01:42:14.034
ASHLEY: Does that make sense to you?

2575
01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.635
LIAM: That he dreamed and it became so?

2576
01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:23.533
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2577
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:33.415
LIAM: Well, that has never happened for me.

2578
01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:36.430
But there are a great many things in this world,

2579
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:37.263
are there not?

2580
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:41.760
ASHLEY: Yes, I seem to

2581
01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:44.890
find that to be true every day.

2582
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:51.950
LIAM: You're having colorful dreams lately?

2583
01:42:56.010 --> 01:42:59.810
ASHLEY: Yeah. Well,

2584
01:43:00.891 --> 01:43:04.641
they're usually, you know, not very colorful,

2585
01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:08.028
just strange, I guess.

2586
01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:13.613
Yeah.

2587
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:21.410
Well, I guess we should get some sleep.

2588
01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.627
LIAM: Yeah, dream again.

2589
01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:27.973
ASHLEY: I hope so.

2590
01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.173
LIAM: You,

2591
01:43:33.184 --> 01:43:34.120
for what it's worth.

2592
01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:38.703
You seem a little more steady.

2593
01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:44.310
ASHLEY: I feel a little more steady.

2594
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.740
Which is weird because we're on a boat.

2595
01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.506
Sorry, that was a bad joke.

2596
01:43:51.506 --> 01:43:53.010
(laughter)

2597
01:43:53.010 --> 01:43:54.593
LIAM: It's pretty good.

2598
01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.343
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel like

2599
01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:06.894
this group is pretty special.

2600
01:44:11.213 --> 01:44:13.490
I know you and I both have gone through some things

2601
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:15.407
and we carry a lot of

2602
01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:18.770
weight with us.

2603
01:44:23.234 --> 01:44:26.237
But boy, do I feel lucky to be with these people.

2604
01:44:27.670 --> 01:44:29.723
LIAM: It's all about

2605
01:44:29.723 --> 01:44:32.876
who you choose to surround yourself with, I think,

2606
01:44:32.876 --> 01:44:35.209
that makes all the difference.

2607
01:44:36.777 --> 01:44:38.277
ASHLEY: I think it does.

2608
01:44:42.657 --> 01:44:44.590
I feel safe with these people.

2609
01:44:46.261 --> 01:44:48.678
LIAM: We feel very safe with you.

2610
01:44:49.764 --> 01:44:51.089
ASHLEY: I hope so.

2611
01:44:53.336 --> 01:44:55.831
LIAM: Caleb pats her arm.

2612
01:44:55.831 --> 01:44:57.270
I'm going to go get

2613
01:44:58.610 --> 01:44:59.818
things ready down below.

2614
01:44:59.818 --> 01:45:02.010
Join us when you're ready.

2615
01:45:02.010 --> 01:45:02.843
ASHLEY: I will.

2616
01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.070
Continue to look out for a bit

2617
01:45:12.392 --> 01:45:14.280
and I'll head downstairs.

2618
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.113
MATT: Mmkay.

2619
01:45:18.150 --> 01:45:21.067
As you all find rest for the night.

2620
01:45:24.868 --> 01:45:26.857
TRAVIS: Don't look over here.

2621
01:45:26.857 --> 01:45:28.261
I don't want it.

2622
01:45:28.261 --> 01:45:30.319

(laughter)

2626
01:45:35.545 --> 01:45:37.628
MATT: The bold face that you've

2627
01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:39.657
grown to carry

2628
01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:44.380
gives way when consciousness does

2629
01:45:45.878 --> 01:45:47.130
as being captain of the ship

2630
01:45:47.130 --> 01:45:49.480
requires a certain amount of strength in face.

2631
01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:55.862
But in those solitary moments of sleep,

2632
01:45:57.111 --> 01:46:01.190
the memory of what it felt to give away to darkness,

2633
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:02.607
a finality of it,

2634
01:46:05.718 --> 01:46:10.652
the experience and memory of the life leaving you.

2635
01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:13.003
It's cold.

2636
01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:15.067
It's scary.

2637
01:46:17.359 --> 01:46:21.259
Especially knowing that thing was still inside you.

2638
01:46:24.624 --> 01:46:25.957
In that quiet,

2639
01:46:28.210 --> 01:46:29.043
cold,

2640
01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:33.880
isolating memory as you close
your eyes and give in to sleep,

2641
01:46:35.868 --> 01:46:39.002
and there is that bloom of green

2642
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:42.723
and warm blossom

2643
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:48.680
that helps wash away the anxiety.

2644
01:46:51.315 --> 01:46:54.439
And while you don't see the face,

2645
01:46:54.439 --> 01:46:57.906
you can feel her there with you, comforting.

2646
01:47:00.995 --> 01:47:02.245
What was once a

2647
01:47:03.690 --> 01:47:06.566
recurring nightmare of

2648
01:47:06.566 --> 01:47:10.282
dark, lightless, abyssal depths.

2649
01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:13.380
It's nice to have a,

2650
01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:16.563
a warm,

2651
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:21.545
motherly embrace to greet you on the other side.

2652
01:47:23.253 --> 01:47:24.963
And even in that

2653
01:47:24.963 --> 01:47:27.421
cold moment of loss

2654
01:47:29.770 --> 01:47:31.318
there's a part of you to believes

2655
01:47:31.318 --> 01:47:34.120
she would've caught you.

2656
01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.953
And that's comforting.

2657
01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.900
Day seven comes to you all in the morning.

2658
01:47:44.852 --> 01:47:48.185
As the storm subsides, the clouds break.

2659
01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:50.810
The rain halts.

2660
01:47:51.949 --> 01:47:54.730
And you all are getting closer and closer

2661
01:47:54.730 --> 01:47:56.397
to your destination.

2662
01:47:58.917 --> 01:48:00.575
Is there anything you want to accomplish today?

2663
01:48:00.575 --> 01:48:03.325
Or do we move on to the next day?

2664
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:06.770
You look like you maybe have,

2665
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:08.244
with the weather clearing up

2666
01:48:08.244 --> 01:48:10.650
all things going according to plan,

2667
01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:14.215
maybe two, two and a half days to your destination.

2668
01:48:14.215 --> 01:48:15.349
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

2669
01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.346
Can we see the Cerberus ship within view?

2670
01:48:19.346 --> 01:48:20.610
MATT: You can, yes.

2671
01:48:20.610 --> 01:48:22.584
It's cloistered in the center

2672
01:48:22.584 --> 01:48:25.810
next to the Blue Heaven.
LIAM: How far off is that about?

2673
01:48:25.810 --> 01:48:30.651
MATT: I'd say it's maybe about

2674
01:48:34.385 --> 01:48:37.070
350, 400 feet off approximately.

2675
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:38.650
LIAM: Okay.

2676
01:48:38.650 --> 01:48:40.630

2677

The Concord ships as part of this armada as well.

2693
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:19.010
It's a beautiful sight now

2694
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:20.810
with the sun bright in the sky,

2695
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:24.840
the clouds mostly broken the reveal blue above.

2696
01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.815
It's energetic and you coast your way

2697
01:49:28.815 --> 01:49:30.610
through and over the water

2698
01:49:30.610 --> 01:49:33.893
towards the maroon colored,

2699
01:49:33.893 --> 01:49:37.340
stylized ship that is the Wind of Aeons.

2700
01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:39.750
As you draw closer, you can see the

2701
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:42.658
crew on deck in the process of keeping eyes out

2702
01:49:42.658 --> 01:49:44.277
someone looks up in points

2703
01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:46.660
with a spyglass in your direction

2704
01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:49.490
and stepping behind them, you can see the Martinet

2705
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:50.653
kind of--

2706
01:49:50.653 --> 01:49:54.061
MARISHA: Knock knock, don't shoot us.

The arcane anti-air gun

2711
01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:02.277
swivels into place.

MATT: You guys touchdown

2719
01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:17.340
on the deck.
MARISHA: I do, like, air back flip

2720
01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.656
and then gracefully land,

2721
01:50:18.656 --> 01:50:20.523
kind of Silver Surfer shit.
MATT: Hell yeah.

2722
01:50:20.523 --> 01:50:21.670
LIAM: I just land normally.

2723
01:50:21.670 --> 01:50:23.090
MATT: Right, of course.

2724
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:24.715
As you guys land, the Martinet

2725
01:50:24.715 --> 01:50:26.881
stands there looking and goes.

2726
01:50:26.881 --> 01:50:29.131
(clapping)

2727
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:33.240
"So by what do we owe this pleasure of a visit?"

2728
01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:36.123
LIAM: I think we just want a bit of a check in

2729
01:50:36.123 --> 01:50:38.981
as we draw near to the hour at hand, yeah.

2730

MATT: "So far so well.

"upon your ship."

2735
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:53.867
LIAM: Yeah, we met Lady DeRogna the other evening.

2736
01:50:53.867 --> 01:50:56.110
Is she here traveling with you?

2737
01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:57.010
MATT: "She is."

2738
01:50:57.010 --> 01:50:59.010
He looks genuinely surprised to hear that you met with her,

2739
01:50:59.010 --> 01:51:00.150
he's like, "Huh."

2740
01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:03.510
MARISHA: She was very kind to
check in on us after the attack.

2741
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:06.394
MATT: "Indeed, she's quite kind."

2742
01:51:06.394 --> 01:51:07.360
MARISHA: Yeah.

2743
01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.873
MATT: "Would you like me to fetch her for you?"

2744
01:51:09.873 --> 01:51:11.299
LIAM: Well.
MARISHA: Please.

2745
01:51:11.299 --> 01:51:12.555
What?
(Travis laughs)

2746
01:51:12.555 --> 01:51:15.470
LIAM: No, I thought I heard something on the ship breaking,

2747
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:17.598
but I was mistaken.

2748
01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.293
LIAM: Yes, yes.

2749
01:51:20.293 --> 01:51:22.500
I think it'd be good if we all spoke together

2750
01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:27.088
including anyone who is here who would be involved

2751
01:51:27.088 --> 01:51:28.772
in deliberations.

2752
01:51:28.772 --> 01:51:29.605
MATT: "Hmm."

2753
01:51:31.222 --> 01:51:33.827
You see him do a familiar hand motion

2754
01:51:33.827 --> 01:51:38.586
as the one you've seen Jester produced many a time.

2755
01:51:38.586 --> 01:51:40.740
"Lady Vess, you are being requested

2756
01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:43.210
"to the deck, please, if you don't mind.

2757
01:51:43.210 --> 01:51:45.275
"We have guests."

2758
01:51:45.275 --> 01:51:47.175
MARISHA: You got, like, five more words.

2759
01:51:47.175 --> 01:51:48.008
Maybe 10.

2760
01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:51.840
No, he's succinct. I forget.

2761
01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.240
LIAM: Yes, pithy.

2762
01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.073
MARISHA: Yep.

2763
01:51:55.610 --> 01:51:58.360
MATT: She just apparates next to him.

2764
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:02.680
(as Vess) "Well, it's very nice to see you both,

2765
01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:06.320
"sooner than anticipated."

2766
01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.890
(as Ludinus) "Yes, they were just saying that you had

2767
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:11.240
"met and checked in on them.

2768
01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:16.450
"So what is it you would like to discuss with us?

2769
01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:19.080
"Is it something that requires privacy?"

2770
01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.592
MARISHA: In time, with the lady,

2771
01:52:21.592 --> 01:52:26.140
but until we get to that point, I think just a general

2772
01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:30.060
sync up on what we're going to be doing.

2773
01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:33.370
LIAM: I think the expositor wouldn't like to know

2774
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:37.654
what your plans are for the moment.

2775
01:52:39.284 --> 01:52:40.142
MARISHA: And how do you see

2776
01:52:40.142 --> 01:52:41.700
us functioning into these?

2777
01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:45.772
LIAM: Yes, the Bright Queen very specifically

2778
01:52:45.772 --> 01:52:47.570
requested that we be there to ensure

2779
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:50.580
that not no funny business--

2780
01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:51.869
MATT: (as Ludinus) "And you are, that is why

2781
01:52:51.869 --> 01:52:54.634
"you're part of this Armada.

2782
01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:56.680
"The discussion is to transpire between

2783
01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:59.637
"both our lead ship and theirs.

2784
01:52:59.637 --> 01:53:01.800
"They will be anchored together.

2785
01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.040
"And this deliberation is to be helmed

2786
01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:08.280
"by the emissary Lord Zeddan Graf himself,

2787
01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.980
"I will be present for this

2788
01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:13.900
"as well as a few designated

2789
01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:16.024
"Righteous Brand elite soldiers

2790
01:53:16.024 --> 01:53:18.330
"and they will have their dignitary

2791
01:53:18.330 --> 01:53:20.413
"as well as protectors as well.

2792
01:53:20.413 --> 01:53:23.870
LIAM: Will Master Ikithon and
any of his protégés be present?

2793
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:26.340
MATT: "No, he is not part of this discussion."

2794
01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:27.820
LIAM: Is he sailing with us?

2795
01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:28.653
MATT: "No.

2796
01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.113
"But

2797
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:36.000
"during that time,

2798
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.677
"Athesias Uludan may join as well.

2799
01:53:39.677 --> 01:53:40.780
"Which should be interesting

2800
01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:45.300
"having to keep him and Zeddan civil.

2801
01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:49.240
"He's already taken quite a bit of my attention.

2802
01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.073
"Lady Vess is here as a--

2803
01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:57.094
"I would say ancillary force,

2804
01:53:57.094 --> 01:53:58.707
"much like you are.

2805
01:53:58.707 --> 01:54:00.040
"She will not be part of the discussions,

2806
01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.380
but will be keeping an eye on the perimeter.

2807
01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:05.547
"As will you. That is your purpose here."

2808
01:54:06.977 --> 01:54:10.612
LIAM: Are you expecting any interference?

2809
01:54:10.612 --> 01:54:13.633
MATT: "I'm always expecting interference."

2810
01:54:13.633 --> 01:54:16.350
MARISHA: What have you done to prepare?

2811
01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:17.850
MATT: "I have my means.

2812
01:54:19.326 --> 01:54:22.680
"And the key to preparing for interference

2813
01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:25.140
"is not letting all of your plans known.

2814
01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:29.223
"But trust and be assured, I've taken precautions."

2815
01:54:31.230 --> 01:54:32.813
LIAM: Trust comes slow.

2816
01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:34.720
MATT: "If at all."

2817
01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:36.873
LIAM: Very true.

2818
01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:40.710
I think perhaps something that would assuage

2819
01:54:40.710 --> 01:54:45.700
our nerves in this endeavor is inspecting

2820
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:50.298
the beacon, as discussed.

2821
01:54:50.298 --> 01:54:52.829
MATT: Lady Vess speaks up and goes,

2822
01:54:52.829 --> 01:54:54.140
"That is of course--"

2823
01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:57.973
and Martinet put his hand up and says,

2824
01:54:57.973 --> 01:55:02.973
"And you would wish to inspect right now?"

2825
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:05.510
MARISHA: No time like the present.

2826
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:06.890
MATT: "Very well,"

2827
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:09.307
looks to Lady Vess, who goes,

2828
01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:11.813
"Come."

2829
01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:14.100
Turns around and the two of them

2830
01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:16.228
begin to walk towards the stairway

2831
01:55:16.228 --> 01:55:19.267
that leads beneath into the ship.

2832
01:55:19.267 --> 01:55:20.100
And you follow?

2833
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.090
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Yes.

2834
01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:22.848
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Are we alone

2835
01:55:22.848 --> 01:55:24.767
or are we being followed?

2836
01:55:24.767 --> 01:55:26.934
MATT: Make a perception check.

2837
01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.996
MARISHA: Okay, 20.
MATT: 20.

2838
01:55:31.996 --> 01:55:33.660
There are two Righteous Brand soldiers

2839
01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.640
that just keep perimeter on the deck.

2840
01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.680
They come together behind you guys

2841
01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:40.360
and step to the top of the stairs, following you

2842
01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:44.494
and then stopping at the top to just play vigil.

2843
01:55:44.494 --> 01:55:45.827
MARISHA: Okay.

2844
01:55:45.827 --> 01:55:47.220
MATT: You're led below to the center deck,

2845
01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:48.990
which is where the gun deck would be.

2846
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:51.240
And you've seen some of the weaponry before.

2847
01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:54.760
Ass opposed to cannons here, they have these--

2848
01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:55.990
they look like cannons,

2849
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:58.860
but there are a number of arcane runes

2850
01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.005
burned into the sides of them.

2851
01:56:00.005 --> 01:56:02.030
They're beautifully made,

2852
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:03.860
very elven in construct

2853
01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:06.966
and they have a brass coil

2854
01:56:06.966 --> 01:56:07.990
towards the edge of it.

2855
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:10.100
LIAM: School of evocation?

2856
01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:10.933
MATT: Yes.

2857
01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.898
Yes, you recognize those actually immediately

2858
01:56:13.898 --> 01:56:16.017
and there's four of them below two on each side.

2859
01:56:16.017 --> 01:56:17.225
MARISHA: It's the magic cannons.

2860
01:56:17.225 --> 01:56:18.892
LIAM: Magic cannons.
MARISHA: That's cool.

2861
01:56:20.141 --> 01:56:21.499
MATT: You passed down.
LIAM: Depends which side you're on.

2862
01:56:21.499 --> 01:56:24.730
MATT: Yeah, this is the deck where you

2863
01:56:24.730 --> 01:56:27.888
had previously seen the discussion

2864
01:56:27.888 --> 01:56:31.271
between the Martinet and Essek.

2865
01:56:31.271 --> 01:56:34.219
You head down to a lower deck which has

2866
01:56:34.219 --> 01:56:38.302
a very, very heavy, enclosed door with no handle.

2867
01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:40.270
As you approach to it,

2868
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:43.070
you can see the Martinet and Vess look at each other.

2869
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:47.365
They both mirror an incantation silently.

2870
01:56:47.365 --> 01:56:49.714
You cannot hear what they say.

2871
01:56:49.714 --> 01:56:52.580
And they face away from you
so as to not have have lips read,

2872
01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:55.100
but they both place their hands in the door simultaneously.

2873
01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:57.925
There's a brief flash of energy

2874
01:56:57.925 --> 01:57:01.258
and the door just disappears.

2875
01:57:01.258 --> 01:57:03.687
Like, flickers and then varnishes.

2876
01:57:03.687 --> 01:57:05.292
And there, inside a chamber,

2877
01:57:05.292 --> 01:57:06.840
you can see there are some tables,

2878
01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.720
there's a tea set on one of the tables in there.

2879
01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:09.770
It's beautifully decorated.

2880
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:11.150
The interior here doesn't feel like

2881
01:57:11.150 --> 01:57:12.490
it's the middle of a ship.

2882
01:57:12.490 --> 01:57:16.230
It feels like it's the center of a guest pavilion

2883
01:57:16.230 --> 01:57:19.030
or some sort of a, a meeting space

2884
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:21.410
for high end political figures.

2885
01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:24.320
A beautiful rug on the floor,

2886
01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:26.356
tapestries and paintings in the walls.

2887
01:57:26.356 --> 01:57:28.606
It seems very out of place.

2888
01:57:29.925 --> 01:57:33.240
But as he steps in, you see he lifts a finger

2889
01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:36.560
and tea is poured into a couple of cups.

2890
01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:37.393
"Are you thirsty?"

2891
01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:39.413
MARISHA: Sure, yeah.

2892
01:57:40.266 --> 01:57:41.940
Thank you.
MATT: "Lady Vess."

2893
01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:44.600
Lady Vess goes ahead and lifts up a secondary cup

2894
01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:46.510
and they both lift them over to you

2895
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:48.160
before pouring some of their own.

2896
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:52.930
MARISHA: This is truly a deck of many things.

2897
01:57:52.930 --> 01:57:55.341
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh, oh.
LAURA: (cackling)

2898
01:57:55.341 --> 01:57:57.107
SAM: (retching)
(laughter)

2899
01:57:57.107 --> 01:57:58.633
MARISHA: Sea water, sea water!

2900
01:57:58.633 --> 01:58:01.390
(laughter)

2901
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:02.969
MATT: Well played.

2902
01:58:02.969 --> 01:58:04.850
LIAM: Single sweat drop just starts to go down Caleb's--

2903
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:07.767
(laughter)

2904
01:58:09.210 --> 01:58:11.377
MARISHA: I'm just going to get like,

2905
01:58:12.330 --> 01:58:15.318
nudge Caleb, his drinking hand

2906
01:58:15.318 --> 01:58:17.260
and I take a sip first.

2907
01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:19.736
Do I taste anything off about the tea?

2908
01:58:19.736 --> 01:58:21.142
Anything weird?

2909
01:58:21.142 --> 01:58:22.100
Sense anything?

2910
01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:23.080
TRAVIS: Because you're immune to poison?

2911
01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:24.284
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: You piece of shit.

2912
01:58:24.284 --> 01:58:26.400
MATT: Okay. (chuckles)

2913
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.233
You taste it.

2914
01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:29.350
It is, it's quite delicious.

2915
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:33.430
It has a bit of a fruity, mango-esque flavor to it,

2916
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:35.373
but not overwhelming to the point where it,

2917
01:58:35.373 --> 01:58:37.045
it feels like it's a juice.

2918
01:58:37.045 --> 01:58:40.100
It's just enough to make it pleasant, but still light.

2919
01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:42.600
It's nice and does not seem to

2920
01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:48.490
carry any sort of toxin that you would recognize or discern.

2921
01:58:48.490 --> 01:58:49.323
MARISHA: Okay.

2922
01:58:49.323 --> 01:58:50.410
LIAM: It's a lich's phylactery.

2923
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:51.531
MARISHA: Yeah.

2924
01:58:51.531 --> 01:58:53.100
(chuckling)

2925
01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:55.183
MATT: Both campaigns, got you!

2926
01:58:56.492 --> 01:59:00.469
Eventually, they both sit down and Lady Vess

2927
01:59:00.469 --> 01:59:03.217
motions for you guys to take a seat.

2928
01:59:03.217 --> 01:59:04.810
LIAM: Thank you.

2929
01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:06.810
Do we see the beacon in this room with us already?

2930
01:59:06.810 --> 01:59:07.893
MATT: You do not.

2931
01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:15.840
LIAM: So how is it you will be

2932
01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.423
a help to the negotiations in a few days, Lady DeRogna?

2933
01:59:21.685 --> 01:59:24.820
MATT: "I had been brought here as a

2934
01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:26.830
"an associate to the Martinet

2935
01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:30.160
"to ensure the transition of this artifact

2936
01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:32.335
"continues without issue,

2937
01:59:32.335 --> 01:59:34.900
"to answer any questions that are brought up,

2938
01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:39.900
"and to assure and hopefully discuss possible future

2939
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:44.130
"alignment between the interests of

2940
01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:47.759
"various arcane projects

2941
01:59:47.759 --> 01:59:50.584
"between the Dynasty and the Empire.

2942
01:59:50.584 --> 01:59:54.870
"We are not confident,

2943
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:57.033
"but at the very least,

2944
01:59:57.033 --> 02:00:00.390
"every beginning conversation is challenging.

2945
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:02.630
"But it is the beginning of a conversation."

2946
02:00:02.630 --> 02:00:03.993
MARISHA: Is the Martinet here in the room with us?

2947
02:00:03.993 --> 02:00:05.880
MATT: Yes, the two of them are sitting
at the table next to you.

2948
02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:07.480
LIAM: They'll open that door for us.

2949
02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.722
MARISHA: Okay. Didn't know if he left or not.

2950
02:00:09.722 --> 02:00:13.330
LIAM: You have hopes, then, not just to end the war,

2951
02:00:13.330 --> 02:00:16.780
but to create agreement

2952
02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:19.570
and collaboration between the two nations.

2953
02:00:19.570 --> 02:00:23.071
MATT: "Well, it make for

2954
02:00:23.071 --> 02:00:26.802
"a much more effective series of programs

2955
02:00:26.802 --> 02:00:29.040
"to work together than against."

2956
02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:29.873
LIAM: I agree.

2957
02:00:32.210 --> 02:00:35.110
MARISHA: Is that have something to do with

2958
02:00:35.110 --> 02:00:37.095
the potential work offerings

2959
02:00:37.095 --> 02:00:39.567
that you mentioned to us before?

2960
02:00:39.567 --> 02:00:41.530
MATT: You see the Martinet gives her a look.

2961
02:00:41.530 --> 02:00:43.021
MARISHA: Yeah.

2962
02:00:44.190 --> 02:00:45.023
MATT: "Possibly,

2963
02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:50.030
"of course, which is why I was
saying after this negotiation,

2964
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:52.880
"that would greatly set the stage of what was possible.

2965
02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.344
"So if it is possible, and things go well,

2966
02:00:55.344 --> 02:00:57.570
"then maybe there is work for you to do

2967
02:00:57.570 --> 02:00:59.430
"at the behest of the Assembly.

2968
02:00:59.430 --> 02:01:02.575
LIAM: Well our calendar--
MATT: She looks back at Martinet.

2969
02:01:02.575 --> 02:01:05.700
LIAM: Our calendar is a little full in the short term.

2970
02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.366
MARISHA: Yeah.

2971
02:01:07.366 --> 02:01:08.449
Got a few stops to make.

2972
02:01:08.449 --> 02:01:10.866
Going to be on the sea for a little bit.

2973
02:01:10.866 --> 02:01:14.967
MATT: "There is no pressure at the moment, of course.

2974
02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:16.717
"There is always time."

2975
02:01:18.093 --> 02:01:20.330
LIAM: Miss Lionett and I are very curious

2976
02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:22.620
what your proclivities are?

2977
02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:26.245
What you are trying to achieve

2978
02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:29.511
or discover in the north?

2979
02:01:29.511 --> 02:01:33.417
MATT: "Well, those would be on a need to know basis."

2980
02:01:34.575 --> 02:01:37.770
MARISHA: I'm looking at the Martinet, is he pissed?

2981
02:01:37.770 --> 02:01:40.353
Is he intrigued?
MATT: Make an insight check.

2982
02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:43.610
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2983
02:01:43.610 --> 02:01:44.868
(cheering)

2984
02:01:44.868 --> 02:01:45.709
MATT: Be right over.

2985
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:48.626
SAM: Whispers!

2986
02:01:48.626 --> 02:01:51.780
TALIESIN: Who's bringing these whispers to us&lt; Sam?

2987
02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:53.530
SAM: There's no sponsor for the whispers

2988
02:01:53.530 --> 02:01:56.502
but I'll just say, nope, this isn't a page.

2989
02:01:56.502 --> 02:01:58.460
(laughter)

2990
02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:00.530
If this was a combat cam,

2991
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:02.100
it would be from Dwarven Forge,

2992
02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:03.520
but it's not, it's just a whisper.

2993
02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:04.670
So I'll just say

2994
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:06.676
that it's sponsored--
LAURA: Happy five years.

2995
02:02:06.676 --> 02:02:07.509
SAM: Sponsored by--
ASHLEY: Happy five years.

2996
02:02:07.509 --> 02:02:09.997
SAM: The fifth year anniversary of Critical Role.

2997
02:02:09.997 --> 02:02:10.830
Cheers.

2998
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:12.364
ASHLEY: Cheers.

2999
02:02:12.364 --> 02:02:14.614
LAURA: No more champagne for us.

3000
02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:23.248
MATT: Martinet says, "Oh, but nevertheless.

3001
02:02:23.248 --> 02:02:24.946
"you're here for a reason."

3002
02:02:24.946 --> 02:02:26.390
And he goes ahead and snap his fingers

3003
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:29.110
and on the floor next to him he watches

3004
02:02:29.110 --> 02:02:33.530
an iridescent chest

3005
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:36.110
(poofing) appears in the space there,

3006
02:02:36.110 --> 02:02:39.390
this slight drifting smoke around it.

3007
02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:40.223
LIAM: Chitty bang bang.

3008
02:02:40.223 --> 02:02:42.198
MATT: Yep. (car engine sputtering)

3009
02:02:42.198 --> 02:02:44.990
(laughter)

3010
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:47.335
As soon as it appears here (creaking)

3011
02:02:47.335 --> 02:02:48.600
and opens the lid

3012
02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.280
and there inside, with a faint,

3013
02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:54.440
familiar, undulating gray glow.

3014
02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.890
You see a beacon.

3015
02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:58.655
MARISHA: Can I tell from this distance if it's

3016
02:02:58.655 --> 02:03:02.685
the one that we saw at Pride's Call?

3017
02:03:02.685 --> 02:03:03.960
MATT: Make a perception check.

3018
02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:06.639
MARISHA: The one that we know is lost.

3019
02:03:06.639 --> 02:03:08.963
TRAVIS: It's bacon!
MARISHA: What is it did you say?

3020
02:03:08.963 --> 02:03:10.130
MATT: Perception.

3021
02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:12.950
MARISHA: Balls, titties and balls.

3022
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:14.210
Five.

3023
02:03:14.210 --> 02:03:15.140
MATT: A five total?

3024
02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:17.036
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled a two.

3025
02:03:17.036 --> 02:03:18.861
MATT: (inhalation)

3026
02:03:18.861 --> 02:03:19.942
TRAVIS: You die.

3027
02:03:19.942 --> 02:03:21.810
MATT: You can't tell.

3028
02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:23.343
LIAM: Do I recognize it?

3029
02:03:23.343 --> 02:03:24.493
I know it's not.
MATT: Make a perception check

3030
02:03:24.493 --> 02:03:26.948
as well, you guys can both roll.

3031
02:03:26.948 --> 02:03:28.951
LAURA: I would guide you, but you didn't take us.

3032
02:03:28.951 --> 02:03:31.540
LIAM: No, we didn't. Sometimes players just run off

3033
02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:32.485
and do shit on their own.

3034
02:03:32.485 --> 02:03:33.979
(laughter)

3035
02:03:33.979 --> 02:03:34.812
MATT: She wouldn't know about that.

3036
02:03:34.812 --> 02:03:35.645
LIAM: No.

3037
02:03:37.364 --> 02:03:39.110
Where'd she go? She's painting dicks in a church somewhere.

3038
02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:39.943
I don't know.

3039
02:03:39.943 --> 02:03:41.900
(laughter)

3040
02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.860
SAM: She's fixing your ship right now.

3041
02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:45.230
LAURA: Yep.
LIAM: 15, not my ship.

3042
02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:46.830
15.
MATT: 15.

3043
02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:48.400
Glancing over, it's not too far from you,

3044
02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.270
but giving it a once over

3045
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:51.103
and you guys have a moment

3046
02:03:51.103 --> 02:03:52.995
there is a pregnant pause at its reveal,

3047
02:03:52.995 --> 02:03:55.179
and they're allowing you to inspect

3048
02:03:55.179 --> 02:03:58.362
there isn't any sort of haste to break

3049
02:03:58.362 --> 02:04:01.623
the purpose that you're here for.

3050
02:04:01.623 --> 02:04:05.360
But its size is larger than the one you saw

3051
02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:08.200
at the Vergessen Sanatorium.

3052
02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:12.609
The handles and inlay match those of

3053
02:04:12.609 --> 02:04:14.160
the ones the Assembly had--

3054
02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.805
not the Assembly, the Dynasty had constructed.

3055
02:04:16.805 --> 02:04:19.530
This is not the one that was recovered from Pride's Call.

3056
02:04:19.530 --> 02:04:21.886
This appears indeed to be.
MARISHA: One of the stolen ones.

3057
02:04:21.886 --> 02:04:22.992
MATT: One of the stolen ones.

3058
02:04:22.992 --> 02:04:25.109
LIAM: Not the one that we toted it around for a while.

3059
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:27.516
MATT: No, that one you gave to the Bright Queen,

3060
02:04:27.516 --> 02:04:30.414
but this one is nearly identical to that one

3061
02:04:30.414 --> 02:04:33.590
in the structure around it.

3062
02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:34.423
LIAM: May I?

3063
02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:39.069
MATT: (as Vess) "Of course. Martinet?"

3064
02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.540
MARISHA: Do it.

3065
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.440
LIAM: Lift it up,

3066
02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:47.358
and set it down, there's little tables, tea tables?

3067
02:04:47.358 --> 02:04:49.240
MATT: There is a table, and as you look for a space,

3068
02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.127
that Martinet wipes his hand,

3069
02:04:51.127 --> 02:04:53.712
and you watch the tea set shift over

3070
02:04:53.712 --> 02:04:55.628
and--
TALIESIN: Crash, bang.

3071
02:04:55.628 --> 02:04:58.045
MATT: And float there in the air.

3072
02:04:59.849 --> 02:05:02.508
LIAM: Beauregard, will you have a look at this with me?

3073
02:05:02.508 --> 02:05:05.578
MARISHA: Same yeah, samesies, yeah.

3074
02:05:08.654 --> 02:05:12.104
LIAM: I would like to slowly take time to

3075
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:17.893
check it for anything hidden or

3076
02:05:19.410 --> 02:05:20.420
affixed to it.

3077
02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:21.578
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3078
02:05:21.578 --> 02:05:22.495
LIAM: Okay.

3079
02:05:27.490 --> 02:05:28.323
MARISHA: Balls.

3080
02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:34.961
Eater of balls.
LIAM: 15.

3081
02:05:34.961 --> 02:05:37.266
SAM: That's not terrible.

3082
02:05:37.266 --> 02:05:39.025
MATT: You take some time you inspect it,

3083
02:05:39.025 --> 02:05:41.711
look over look at the the casing,

3084
02:05:41.711 --> 02:05:45.692
looking at the handles, looking within it, it is unmarred.

3085
02:05:45.692 --> 02:05:48.588
There are no cracks or imperfections in the dodecahedron.

3086
02:05:48.588 --> 02:05:50.921
The beacon seems solid. The,

3087
02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:55.018
the golden materials

3088
02:05:55.018 --> 02:05:57.290
and the inlay that holds it there

3089
02:05:57.290 --> 02:06:01.201
and affixes the handles to it seemed pristine.

3090
02:06:01.201 --> 02:06:03.284
Doesn't appear to be altered in any way.

3091
02:06:03.284 --> 02:06:04.117
LIAM: Okay.

3092
02:06:04.117 --> 02:06:05.780
MATT: It's different than the one.

3093
02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:07.600
Yeah, it's different because it is a unique beacon,

3094
02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:10.540
but it is familiar to the one that you

3095
02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:13.337
had lugged around for quite some time.

3096
02:06:13.337 --> 02:06:15.889
LIAM: I'm going to inspect it further.

3097
02:06:15.889 --> 02:06:18.597
Don't mind me and begin to go through the process

3098
02:06:18.597 --> 02:06:21.070
of casting Detect Magic upon it.

3099
02:06:21.070 --> 02:06:21.903
MATT: Okay.

3100
02:06:21.903 --> 02:06:23.416
They do not flinch.

3101
02:06:23.416 --> 02:06:28.181
You cast the spell and a very, very strong,

3102
02:06:28.181 --> 02:06:30.860
magical aura emanates from it,

3103
02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:32.090
LIAM: And is it all dunamancy?

3104
02:06:32.090 --> 02:06:33.730
MATT: It's all very heavily dunamancy.

3105
02:06:33.730 --> 02:06:35.867
Like while all the schools of magic

3106
02:06:35.867 --> 02:06:37.822
are contained within dunamancy in a sense,

3107
02:06:37.822 --> 02:06:42.739
the dunamantic essence from it is so strong and so

3108
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:49.360
esoteric, and in much like when you had first inspected

3109
02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.560
the beacons upon arriving

3110
02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.010
it is almost overwhelming.

3111
02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:53.560
It's like looking into the sun.

3112
02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:58.190
LIAM: And finally, I will place both my hands on it

3113
02:06:58.190 --> 02:06:59.679
and stare into it.

3114
02:06:59.679 --> 02:07:00.906
MARISHA: I'm going to step in front

3115
02:07:00.906 --> 02:07:03.179
and just not take my eyes off

3116
02:07:03.179 --> 02:07:05.530
of the two of them while he takes a minute.

3117
02:07:05.530 --> 02:07:06.880
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Going to take a dive.

3118
02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:10.532
MATT: All right, you continue to focus and lean towards it.

3119
02:07:10.532 --> 02:07:14.870
As you do you feel your essence extend, and the

3120
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:16.837
interior of the chamber fades away

3121
02:07:16.837 --> 02:07:21.280
as you feel your consciousness drawn into a nexus of

3122
02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:24.480
possibility, infinite and endless around you.

3123
02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.001
Starscapes, stars, are they people?

3124
02:07:27.001 --> 02:07:29.522
Are they points in time? Historical moments?

3125
02:07:29.522 --> 02:07:30.730
Future moments to happen?

3126
02:07:30.730 --> 02:07:32.974
It is so much information at once.

3127
02:07:32.974 --> 02:07:35.740
And you feel a part of yourself pulled in

3128
02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:37.860
and a part of it comes into you.

3129
02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.459
And in that space of endless possibility.

3130
02:07:39.459 --> 02:07:41.171
You can see the threads of fate and

3131
02:07:41.171 --> 02:07:43.520
the bodies that walk in the world around you.

3132
02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:46.189
You feel like you have an outside look on Exandria

3133
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:47.960
and beyond the tapestry that creates it,

3134
02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:50.319
but yet so small in this one infinitesimal moment

3135
02:07:50.319 --> 02:07:52.360
and have both at the same time overlapping.

3136
02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:55.290
It's starting to pull at the edges of your sanity

3137
02:07:55.290 --> 02:07:56.660
for but a moment,

3138
02:07:56.660 --> 02:08:00.831
and you withdraw as the mote is carried with you,

3139
02:08:00.831 --> 02:08:04.020
and you have a fragment of possibility within yourself.

3140
02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:06.937
You keep an eye, they don't flinch.

3141
02:08:08.074 --> 02:08:10.540
They seem almost impatient. (chuckling)

3142
02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:14.490
MARISHA: I don't say anything, I just look at them

3143
02:08:14.490 --> 02:08:17.670
like those tough ass bodyguards.

3144
02:08:17.670 --> 02:08:19.031
See.

3145
02:08:19.031 --> 02:08:20.894
LIAM: Those tough ass Beauregards?
TRAVIS: What do they look like?

3146
02:08:20.894 --> 02:08:23.235
MARISHA: Yeah, those tough ass Beauregards.

3147
02:08:23.235 --> 02:08:26.128
Just this, just this.

3148
02:08:26.128 --> 02:08:26.961
Right now.

3149
02:08:26.961 --> 02:08:30.349
(laughter)

3150
02:08:30.349 --> 02:08:31.182
TRAVIS: Slay.

3151
02:08:32.727 --> 02:08:34.440
MATT: I've seen her get in a
dude's face before with that look,

3152
02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:36.190
it's not pretty.

3153
02:08:36.190 --> 02:08:38.530
MARISHA: Oh, that's a story for another time.

3154
02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:39.488
MATT: Oh yeah, I know.

3155
02:08:39.488 --> 02:08:40.904
SAM: No, let's stop the show and tell everyone.

3156
02:08:40.904 --> 02:08:43.688
(laughter)

3157
02:08:43.688 --> 02:08:45.577
TALIESIN: We're doing sand kings? Oh, never mind. Carry on.

3158
02:08:45.577 --> 02:08:47.269
(laughter)

3159
02:08:47.269 --> 02:08:48.335
MATT: So it's always great

3160
02:08:48.335 --> 02:08:50.675
when there's that instinct as a guy to,

3161
02:08:50.675 --> 02:08:53.080
you know, intervene when somebody else

3162
02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.580
is bothering your girlfriend or wife,

3163
02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:55.860
but I don't need to.

3164
02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:59.543
I just get to watch her destroy them every time.

3165
02:08:59.543 --> 02:09:01.470
Anyway, Caleb?

3166
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:02.303
LIAM: I

3167
02:09:04.170 --> 02:09:05.495
see why

3168
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:08.130
this is

3169
02:09:09.337 --> 02:09:10.170
of such value

3170
02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:12.830
and two nations are

3171
02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.090
at odds over it.

3172
02:09:17.090 --> 02:09:20.532
I commend you on letting go of it

3173
02:09:21.607 --> 02:09:26.607
MATT: (as Ludinus) "It is important
to keep things under control

3174
02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:28.053
"and

3175
02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.556
"hopefully without disrupting society."

3176
02:09:35.565 --> 02:09:37.190
LIAM: To Lady DeRogna:

3177
02:09:38.346 --> 02:09:40.904
So much to learn.

3178
02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.053
I am surprised you are able to let it go.

3179
02:09:47.959 --> 02:09:50.750
MATT: (as Vess) "Well, it is not easy

3180
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:53.634
"by any means, but

3181
02:09:57.967 --> 02:10:00.717
"it is just how things have to be."

3182
02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:05.255
LIAM: Seems like a missed opportunity for our home.

3183
02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:07.920
MATT: "Well, if these talks go well,

3184
02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:12.160
"maybe there will be opportunities to share

3185
02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.135
"without bloodshed."

3186
02:10:15.553 --> 02:10:17.599
LIAM: Does she seem bullshit?

3187
02:10:17.599 --> 02:10:19.640
MATT: Roll an insight check.

3188
02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:20.473
MARISHA: Come on.

3189
02:10:20.473 --> 02:10:23.624
SAM: Does she seem bullshit?

3190
02:10:23.624 --> 02:10:26.834
MATT: She is made of bullshit.

3191
02:10:26.834 --> 02:10:29.834
TALIESIN: 100% pure bull manure.

3192
02:10:31.354 --> 02:10:33.148
MATT: It's like the guy that turned to jelly in Airplane II.

3193
02:10:33.148 --> 02:10:36.390
LIAM: 10, 10 total. I just rolled a two. 10 total.

3194
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:38.242
SAM: Whispers.

3195
02:10:38.242 --> 02:10:41.382
MATT: I mean, she's generally
pretty guarded and hard to read.

3196
02:10:41.382 --> 02:10:42.680
You're not sure if she's telling the truth,

3197
02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:44.860
she's lying. She's putting a statement forward

3198
02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:46.860
and then sticking to it.

3199
02:10:47.793 --> 02:10:50.015
MARISHA: I hope you have a very understanding contact on

3200
02:10:50.015 --> 02:10:52.973
the side of the Dynasty.

3201
02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:57.051
MATT: "I hope so as well."

3202
02:10:57.051 --> 02:10:59.930
MARISHA: We'll be keeping our fingers crossed.

3203
02:10:59.930 --> 02:11:03.280
LIAM: Yes, this all seems to be in order.

3204
02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:06.778
I feel confident this will go very well.

3205
02:11:06.778 --> 02:11:10.753
MATT: (as Ludinus) "As do I.
We have all the pieces in place."

3206
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:14.514
MARISHA: We'll keep our ship very close by

3207
02:11:14.514 --> 02:11:16.443
on the day of the negotiations.

3208
02:11:16.443 --> 02:11:18.190
MATT: Lowers the beacon to the same chest

3209
02:11:18.190 --> 02:11:21.497
and it closes and vanishes.

3210
02:11:21.497 --> 02:11:25.830
MARISHA: We'll make sure we're stationed on the other side.

3211
02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:30.517
Where are the prisoners? Where are you keeping them?

3212
02:11:30.517 --> 02:11:32.310
MATT: "Those are being maintained

3213
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:36.960
"by the Lord Graf in the Blue Heaven.

3214
02:11:40.518 --> 02:11:42.887
LIAM: Well, I think we've done what we set out to do.

3215
02:11:42.887 --> 02:11:45.790
MARISHA: I have no further questions.

3216
02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:48.440
SAM: The prosecution rests.

3217
02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.050
MATT: "It was a pleasure to see you

3218
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:51.883
"and

3219
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:56.900
"to our victorious peace talks."

3220
02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:57.983
LIAM: Yes.

3221
02:11:57.983 --> 02:12:00.946
Thank you so much, both of you for your time.

3222
02:12:00.946 --> 02:12:03.020
MATT: They both stand up,

3223
02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:04.866
guide you back to the deck.

3224
02:12:04.866 --> 02:12:06.524
LIAM: <i>Bis später</i>.

3225
02:12:07.707 --> 02:12:09.957
MARISHA: Catch you later, DeRogna.

3226
02:12:11.007 --> 02:12:14.780
MATT: (as Vess) "Looking forward to it, Beauregard."

3227
02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:15.613
MARISHA: Yep.

3228
02:12:16.627 --> 02:12:18.240
LIAM: And I pull out the raven's feather again

3229
02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:19.954
and I cast Fly on the two of us.

3230
02:12:19.954 --> 02:12:21.740
MATT: Fly lasts for how long?

3231
02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:22.573
LIAM: 10 minutes
MATT: 10 minutes,

3232
02:12:22.573 --> 02:12:23.900
yeah, so it would've have faded, yeah.

3233
02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:25.578
LIAM: So we Mary Poppins away.

3234
02:12:25.578 --> 02:12:26.578
MATT: All right.

3235
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:31.990
As you guys glide your way back towards the ship

3236
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:33.915
we're going to go and take a break.

3237
02:12:33.915 --> 02:12:36.108
Because it is 9:15.

3238
02:12:36.108 --> 02:12:38.922
TRAVIS: A serpent comes up out of the water
and snatches both of you.

3239
02:12:38.922 --> 02:12:40.510
(laughter)

3240
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:41.638
LAURA: We never knew what happened

3241
02:12:41.638 --> 02:12:44.220
MATT: Don't spoil my return, man.

3242
02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.661
ASHLEY: Can you do the noise again?

3243
02:12:45.661 --> 02:12:46.647
MATT: Which one?
LAURA: The (poofing).

3244
02:12:46.647 --> 02:12:47.488
TRAVIS: You know the one.
MARISHA: The Chitty--

3245
02:12:47.488 --> 02:12:48.339
MATT: (poofing)

3246
02:12:48.339 --> 02:12:51.155
(laughter)

3247
02:12:51.155 --> 02:12:52.104
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

3248
02:12:52.104 --> 02:12:53.538
TALIESIN: You're making me feel so bad.

3249
02:12:53.538 --> 02:12:55.440
(chuckling)

3250
02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:57.590
MATT: That sound in particular reminds me

3251
02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:01.455
of the poor wolf coyote from Sword in the Stone

3252
02:13:01.455 --> 02:13:02.646
that can't catch up and at one moment,

3253
02:13:02.646 --> 02:13:03.643
where he is super tired, he's like,

3254
02:13:03.643 --> 02:13:06.351
(heavy panting).

3255
02:13:06.351 --> 02:13:08.394
I love it so much.

3256
02:13:08.394 --> 02:13:10.750
Anyway, we're taking a break,

3257
02:13:10.750 --> 02:13:11.980
we'll back here in a few minutes.

3258
02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:14.805
Before we get to that, we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway

3259
02:13:14.805 --> 02:13:16.140
of the night,

3260
02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:18.840
we have a fantastic black walnut table tray

3261
02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:22.180
with leather for one lucky winner in the chat.

3262
02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:26.430
Tonight's chat keyword is punish.

3263
02:13:26.430 --> 02:13:29.690
Punish. Enter it in once and only once. More than once,

3264
02:13:29.690 --> 02:13:32.595
you'll be disqualified. Once again for US and Canada only,

3265
02:13:32.595 --> 02:13:35.570
excluding Quebec, maybe only for a little while longer

3266
02:13:35.570 --> 02:13:36.890
because I saw the article that Quebec

3267
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:38.716
is trying to loosen their giveaway laws.

3268
02:13:38.716 --> 02:13:40.836
ALL: Wow!

3269
02:13:40.836 --> 02:13:42.990
MATT: So fingers crossed, because we would love to get

3270
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:45.807
some Quebec people into this.

3271
02:13:45.807 --> 02:13:48.833
TRAVIS: Chill, Quebec.
(laughter)

3272
02:13:48.833 --> 02:13:50.650
SAM: Hey, chill, Quebec.

3273
02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:52.774
MATT: Anyway, we'll be back here in just a little bit

3274
02:13:52.774 --> 02:13:54.390
with the second half of today's session.

3275
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:56.223
We'll see you shortly.

3276
02:13:57.764 --> 02:13:58.925

3300
02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:58.873
It was a pitch perfect performance.

3301
02:15:01.090 --> 02:15:03.150
MATT: Hello everyone,

3302
02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:04.470
Matt here. Just wanted to say

3303
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:07.870
happy five year anniversary to Critical Role.

3304
02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:10.139
This is, it's insane.

3305
02:15:10.139 --> 02:15:11.580
I have no other way to express it.

3306
02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:14.580
We're here on our fifth year of

3307
02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:15.980
telling these stories on the internet

3308
02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:19.160
and building the greatest community and fandom

3309
02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:22.890
around the property on the internet, in my opinion.

3310
02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:25.560
I'm just so thankful.

3311
02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.500
I'm thankful, I've no other word to describe it.

3312
02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:29.247
You've all been absolutely incredible.

3313
02:15:29.247 --> 02:15:30.994
Your support for the show and what we're doing,

3314
02:15:30.994 --> 02:15:33.170
your support for each other.

3315
02:15:33.170 --> 02:15:34.900
And we're just super excited to continue

3316
02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:36.140
to tell these stories with you

3317
02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:38.870
to make fun content with you

3318
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:40.308
and be silly on the internet

3319
02:15:40.308 --> 02:15:42.400
and hope you guys still continue to come along with us.

3320
02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.254
So happy five year anniversary.

3321
02:15:45.254 --> 02:15:46.710
I love you guys very much.

3322
02:15:46.710 --> 02:15:51.060
And I guess to the next five, I guess!

3323
02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:53.270
We'll see. (kiss)

3324
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:54.570
ASHLEY: Critters,

3325
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:57.330
happy five year anniversary!

3326
02:15:57.330 --> 02:15:58.240
Oh my gosh,

3327
02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:00.000
I can't believe it's been five years.

3328
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
And to all the OG critters that were with us from day one,

3329
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.260
to the critters who have joined us in campaign two,

3330
02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:12.311
we are so beyond grateful for all the love and support

3331
02:16:12.311 --> 02:16:13.830
that you've shown us

3332
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:16.690
and for coming along this journey with us.

3333
02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:20.938
You all have absolutely changed our lives,

3334
02:16:20.938 --> 02:16:23.973
and we can't thank you enough.

3335
02:16:23.973 --> 02:16:26.623
And for those times where I was in New York,

3336
02:16:26.623 --> 02:16:30.290
and I wasn't able to be there and all your love and wishes

3337
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:32.923
and your amazing character art--

3338
02:16:32.923 --> 02:16:34.131
That pulled me through a lot.

3339
02:16:34.131 --> 02:16:35.750
So thank you so much.

3340
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:38.310
And thank you for being there for us

3341
02:16:38.310 --> 02:16:41.410
and to another five years. (kiss)

3342
02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:42.580
Love you.

3343
02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:44.520
TRAVIS: Hey, you beautiful people.

3344
02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:46.130
I can't believe it's been five years

3345
02:16:46.130 --> 02:16:49.800
since we first started streaming our show, what?

3346
02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:52.600
I do distinctly remember early in that spring of 2015

3347
02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.808
Matt Mercer coming over to our game

3348
02:16:53.808 --> 02:16:55.513
and telling us that we were going to take a shot,

3349
02:16:55.513 --> 02:16:58.690
putting it on the internet, whatever that means,

3350
02:16:58.690 --> 02:17:01.050
and just not knowing how to feel about that.

3351
02:17:01.050 --> 02:17:03.178
I mean, it was ours and it was private

3352
02:17:03.178 --> 02:17:05.320
and who's going to want to watch a bunch of

3353
02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.733
voice actors play D&amp;D for a few hours every week?

3354
02:17:08.733 --> 02:17:11.000
Turns out the last five years have been

3355
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.560
just evidence to the contrary of that, shows what we know.

3356
02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:16.940
But we're so insanely grateful for you guys.

3357
02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:19.490
Thank you for sharing your hearts and your minds

3358
02:17:19.490 --> 02:17:23.050
and your energy and your art and your talent,

3359
02:17:23.050 --> 02:17:24.110
your compassion with us.

3360
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:26.470
It's been so insanely rewarding,

3361
02:17:26.470 --> 02:17:27.303
and we feel like we're

3362
02:17:27.303 --> 02:17:28.766
the luckiest group of people in the world.

3363
02:17:28.766 --> 02:17:30.160
And even though it's been five years,

3364
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:33.219
it really feels like it's just the beginning.

3365
02:17:33.219 --> 02:17:36.330
We have so much cool stuff to share with you guys coming up

3366
02:17:36.330 --> 02:17:38.079
and so many more adventures to go on

3367
02:17:38.079 --> 02:17:39.460
and we just can't wait for you to see it.

3368
02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.626
So here's to the next five years.

3369
02:17:41.626 --> 02:17:46.626
We love you guys and I really hope that I'm not dead.

3370
02:17:46.630 --> 02:17:47.463
LAURA: Hi.

3371
02:17:49.090 --> 02:17:50.848
So I just put Ronin to bed.

3372
02:17:52.088 --> 02:17:57.067
That's our son, that we've had, since doing this show.

3373
02:17:59.133 --> 02:18:00.240
Five years.

3374
02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:03.460
Five years!

3375
02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:06.670
You realize that's longer than most relationships.

3376
02:18:06.670 --> 02:18:10.755
I mean, longer than any relationship I had before Travis,

3377
02:18:10.755 --> 02:18:12.505
that's for damn sure.

3378
02:18:14.210 --> 02:18:15.260
Wow.

3379
02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:16.093
I mean.

3380
02:18:17.350 --> 02:18:19.237
I can't--

3381
02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:24.700
I can't believe how much we've all, you know, grown

3382
02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:29.000
and changed since we started doing the show.

3383
02:18:30.223 --> 02:18:32.360
And I feel like you guys have been there

3384
02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:34.310
with us every step of the way.

3385
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:36.962
I feel like you guys know us better than

3386
02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:40.010
some of our best friends

3387
02:18:40.010 --> 02:18:44.450
because you see us in our best moments,

3388
02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:48.770
in our worst moments, in our ups and our downs and--

3389
02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:53.714
I-- god.

3390
02:18:53.714 --> 02:18:55.600
I have so much love for you guys.

3391
02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:57.267
I have so much love.

3392
02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:00.633
Thank you for-- god--

3393
02:19:01.839 --> 02:19:03.500
I'm not going to cry.

3394
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:04.560
Thank you for

3395
02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:08.430
your continued support

3396
02:19:08.430 --> 02:19:10.990
and your excitement

3397
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:13.300
and your imagination,

3398
02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:14.280
your creativity,

3399
02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.030
and everything that you guys put--

3400
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:21.377
put forth to us.

3401
02:19:23.201 --> 02:19:24.501
Oh god.

3402
02:19:25.395 --> 02:19:27.395
I just love you so much.

3403
02:19:28.345 --> 02:19:31.412
I mean five years, it's nothing in the long run.

3404
02:19:31.412 --> 02:19:34.750
We're going to be doing this for at least another hundred.

3405
02:19:34.750 --> 02:19:38.734
I mean, Taliesin will, for sure.

3406
02:19:41.199 --> 02:19:44.324
I'll see you guys in another five.

3407
02:19:45.242 --> 02:19:46.830
I'm not going to cry then either,

3408
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:50.370
because I'm really tough, so.

3409
02:19:50.370 --> 02:19:52.960
LIAM: Dear critter community, the world around.

3410
02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:53.986
Thank you.

3411
02:19:53.986 --> 02:19:55.949
Thank you for journeying with us

3412
02:19:55.949 --> 02:19:58.320
for five years of this show.

3413
02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:00.241
I remember sitting down for the very first game,

3414
02:20:00.241 --> 02:20:02.280
on the very first episode,

3415
02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:04.645
and somehow it's five years later.

3416
02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:09.850
This has been an adventure born out of friendship and love.

3417
02:20:09.850 --> 02:20:10.750
And it still is.

3418
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:13.914
And even now, after everything that's happened, we--

3419
02:20:13.914 --> 02:20:16.277
none of us can fathom how far down this road

3420
02:20:16.277 --> 02:20:17.944
we've come together.

3421
02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:23.370
And I just feel like expressing some gratitude for it.

3422
02:20:23.370 --> 02:20:26.230
Really, thank you. Getting to tell stories together

3423
02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:29.320
the way we have for all this time, every week,

3424
02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:31.330
has been one of the greatest gifts in our lives,

3425
02:20:31.330 --> 02:20:33.162
certainly in mine,

3426
02:20:33.162 --> 02:20:36.909
and your support and enthusiasm has meant the world.

3427
02:20:36.909 --> 02:20:41.850
So how lucky we've been to have had all of you with us.

3428
02:20:41.850 --> 02:20:43.790
How lucky indeed.

3429
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:45.073
Thank you.

3430
02:20:45.935 --> 02:20:47.600
TALIESIN: Hey, everybody.

3431
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:51.791
It's been five-- been five years

3432
02:20:51.791 --> 02:20:54.290
of this strange show.

3433
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:58.840
And thank you so much for joining us every Thursday

3434
02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:01.620
for our ridiculousness.

3435
02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:04.538
And I cannot wait to show you all what

3436
02:21:04.538 --> 02:21:07.037
we've been working on for this year.

3437
02:21:07.037 --> 02:21:10.456
It's going to be pretty cool. (chuckles)

3438
02:21:10.456 --> 02:21:12.910
Thank you all so much.

3439
02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:17.011
And see you next Thursday, this Thursday,

3440
02:21:17.011 --> 02:21:20.132
as many Thursdays as we can manage.

3441
02:21:20.132 --> 02:21:20.965
Thank you.

3442
02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:25.760
MARISHA: Hello and happy five year anniversary,

3443
02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:28.550
all the critters all over the world.

3444
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:32.340
I can't believe it's already been five years

3445
02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:33.580
of doing this show.

3446
02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:36.976
I think if someone would have come to me five years ago

3447
02:21:36.976 --> 02:21:39.720
and told me that my D&amp;D game was going to be

3448
02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:43.150
a part of a global nerdy phenomenon,

3449
02:21:43.150 --> 02:21:45.660
I probably would have punched them in the face

3450
02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:50.350
and then asked to borrow five bucks for gas money.

3451
02:21:50.350 --> 02:21:54.692
So every day is just a wild ride,

3452
02:21:54.692 --> 02:21:57.550
and I think what I am most grateful for

3453
02:21:57.550 --> 02:22:01.163
is the way that this entire experience

3454
02:22:01.163 --> 02:22:06.163
has really given my faith back in humanity.

3455
02:22:06.827 --> 02:22:09.140
And that's because of you all.

3456
02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:11.931
Also, Dagon thanks you

3457
02:22:11.931 --> 02:22:15.370
for making her a bird-lebrity.

3458
02:22:15.370 --> 02:22:18.130
I don't think she could ever go back to the lifestyle

3459
02:22:18.130 --> 02:22:21.850
that she lived before being a famous bird.

3460
02:22:21.850 --> 02:22:24.040
So that's, that's on you all.

3461
02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:25.805
Thank you.

3462
02:22:25.805 --> 02:22:27.320
Happy anniversary.

3463
02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:29.203
Love you all so much.

3464
02:22:29.203 --> 02:22:31.453
I'll see you next Thursday.

3465
02:22:32.370 --> 02:22:34.810
SAM: Happy fifth anniversary, everybody.

3466
02:22:34.810 --> 02:22:37.900
Wow, I can't believe that we're really here five years

3467
02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:41.230
into this crazy experiment called Critical Role.

3468
02:22:41.230 --> 02:22:43.240
We're so grateful for you guys.

3469
02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:47.721
The critters who've been with us this entire wild ride.

3470
02:22:47.721 --> 02:22:49.560
I don't know what the future holds.

3471
02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.740
I don't know what our next adventure will be.

3472
02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:55.077
But I'm so excited to explore it with you guys

3473
02:22:55.077 --> 02:22:57.287
and to share it with you.

3474
02:22:57.287 --> 02:23:00.510
I'm looking forward to five more years of role playing

3475
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:03.720
and shows and adventures and excitement

3476
02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:06.311
and five more years...

3477
02:23:06.311 --> 02:23:07.336
of shirts.

3478
02:23:07.336 --> 02:23:09.130
Because, I mean, look at these guys.

3479
02:23:09.130 --> 02:23:10.460
There's so many.

3480
02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:11.600
And they've there's so--

3481
02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:15.030
they're ridiculous and I get to make them

3482
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:16.900
for maybe another five years.

3483
02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:20.561
So hey, watch out, Matt, because I'm coming for you.

3484
02:23:20.561 --> 02:23:21.894
I'm coming for you.

3485
02:23:21.894 --> 02:23:23.596
And the shirts won't stop.

3486
02:23:23.596 --> 02:23:28.080
(upbeat jazz music)

3487
02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:29.500
MARISHA: Hello everyone.

3488
02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.870
It's me, Marisha Ray,

3489
02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:34.680
Creative Director for Critical Role content.

3490
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:36.760
And I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

3491
02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:39.870
about how much we appreciate your support.

3492
02:23:39.870 --> 02:23:44.136
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

3493
02:23:44.136 --> 02:23:45.344
Over the past five years,

3494
02:23:45.344 --> 02:23:48.070
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

3495
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:51.461
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

3496
02:23:51.461 --> 02:23:55.030
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes,

3497
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:57.155
and putting our loyal employees

3498
02:23:57.155 --> 02:24:00.109
in slightly embarrassing situations eagerly hoping

3499
02:24:00.109 --> 02:24:02.560
that we've captured your attention.

3500
02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:06.090
Today, I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

3501
02:24:06.090 --> 02:24:08.442
written by Brian W. Foster.

3502
02:24:08.442 --> 02:24:11.297
Or dressing Sam as a celebrity to recreate

3503
02:24:11.297 --> 02:24:14.348
an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

3504
02:24:14.348 --> 02:24:17.520
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

3505
02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.971
requires you to re-subscribe each month.

3506
02:24:19.971 --> 02:24:23.680
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

3507
02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:25.740
or have to put Matt in cosplay

3508
02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:28.321
to tell you that you can easily give subscriptions

3509
02:24:28.321 --> 02:24:30.990
to fellow critters if you're feeling generous.

3510
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:34.619
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

3511
02:24:34.619 --> 02:24:38.340
shooting complicated parody promos featuring Taliesin Jaffe

3512
02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:42.240
as a vintage spooky boy in full monochromatic glory

3513
02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:47.220
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub.

3514
02:24:47.220 --> 02:24:49.370
But not today.

3515
02:24:49.370 --> 02:24:51.360
No weird graphics.

3516
02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:52.997
No puppet murder.

3517
02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:55.645
No Sam Riegel.

3518
02:24:59.050 --> 02:25:01.130
It's just me,

3519
02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:02.288
here to say:

3520
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:04.365
thank you.

3521
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:06.293
Love you all.

3522
02:25:07.710 --> 02:25:09.684
Good night. (kiss)

3523
02:25:09.684 --> 02:25:12.384
(upbeat jazz music)

3524
02:25:16.197 --> 02:25:19.731
(intense electronic metal music)

3525
02:25:51.218 --> 02:25:54.468
(upbeat electronic music)

3526
02:26:17.253 --> 02:26:19.600
LIAM: Cheers
SAM: Should we do another inhale-exhale?

3527
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:20.905
SATINE: Yeah.

3528
02:26:20.905 --> 02:26:25.905
SATINE, LIAM, and SAM: (inhale) (exhale)

3529
02:26:26.138 --> 02:26:29.138
(upbeat electronic music)

3530
02:26:40.064 --> 02:26:43.093
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

3531
02:26:43.093 --> 02:26:46.227
BRIAN: "Did Fjord have any trepidation
about being on the sea?

3532
02:26:46.227 --> 02:26:48.320
"Were you as a player expecting this

3533
02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:49.930
"or did Matt blindside you?"

3534
02:26:49.930 --> 02:26:52.291
TRAVIS: No, I'm a fucking moron.

3535
02:26:52.291 --> 02:26:53.499
BRIAN: I guess, yeah,

3536
02:26:53.499 --> 02:26:56.541
we kind of know the answer to that one.

3537
02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:59.281
TRAVIS: I didn't think about it at all!

3538
02:26:59.281 --> 02:27:02.029
(laughter)

3539
02:27:02.029 --> 02:27:03.368
TRAVIS: I'm sure people are like,

3540
02:27:03.368 --> 02:27:06.180
"How the fuck did you not think the first time

3541
02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:10.210
"you were back on the sea Uk'otoa's coming correct?!"

3542
02:27:10.210 --> 02:27:14.440
Well, I didn't! I'm sorry!

3543
02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:17.498
BRIAN: We went to Disneyland the next morning,

3544
02:27:17.498 --> 02:27:19.050
right? It was the next morning?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3545
02:27:19.050 --> 02:27:22.075
BRIAN: The next morning I was like, "Hey man..."

3546
02:27:22.075 --> 02:27:24.801
(as Travis) "Nope! Nope!"

3547
02:27:24.801 --> 02:27:26.560
I was like, "Oh no."

3548
02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:27.393
TRAVIS: I thought, like,

3549
02:27:27.393 --> 02:27:28.476
you know well,
ASHLEY: Funny.

3550
02:27:28.476 --> 02:27:30.560
TRAVIS: There'll be some RP, and we'll get out there,

3551
02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:32.730
and there'll be this deal that happens,

3552
02:27:32.730 --> 02:27:35.249
and I don't really know what's going to happen next,

3553
02:27:35.249 --> 02:27:38.053
maybe I'll have to check on some elements from my backstory

3554
02:27:38.053 --> 02:27:41.300
TRAVIS: You thought for sure you'd be able to see it coming?

3555
02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:44.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, I don't have anything that

3556
02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:47.820
the old snea snake wants any more.
BRIAN: Yes, you do.

3557
02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:49.050
Yes, you do.

3558
02:27:49.050 --> 02:27:50.516
TRAVIS: Well, I didn't know that!

3559
02:27:50.516 --> 02:27:52.611
BRIAN: Read your inventory.
TRAVIS: I didn't get an MRI,

3560
02:27:52.611 --> 02:27:55.244
I didn't know I had a grapefruit in my chest any more.

3561
02:27:55.244 --> 02:27:59.391
BRIAN: Does D&amp;D Beyond have an inner body inventory part?

3562
02:27:59.391 --> 02:28:00.337
They should add it.

3563
02:28:00.337 --> 02:28:01.678
Adam, if you're watching.

3564
02:28:01.678 --> 02:28:05.740
Ashley: "Yasha is continuing to play her harp more

3565
02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:08.430
"and prioritize it as a method of self care

3566
02:28:08.430 --> 02:28:10.400
"at the end of her day out.

3567
02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:11.460
"Can you share a little bit about

3568
02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:14.030
"how it feels for her to have this gentle and safe outlet

3569
02:28:14.030 --> 02:28:16.400
"for some of her pain and emotion?"

3570
02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.380
ASHLEY: I'm using the

3571
02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:23.570
harp as, yes, for self care for her,

3572
02:28:23.570 --> 02:28:27.900
but also I think music can be a form of therapy.

3573
02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:28.733
So,

3574
02:28:30.689 --> 02:28:32.680
you know, and there was a moment where I was like,

3575
02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:36.210
"Man, it'd be so fun to multi class as a bard."

3576
02:28:36.210 --> 02:28:40.035
But then I remembered my wisdom is so low.

3577
02:28:40.035 --> 02:28:42.090
BRIAN: That's right, yeah, that's right.

3578
02:28:42.090 --> 02:28:45.090
ASHLEY: So it just, I wouldn't be able to--

3579
02:28:46.396 --> 02:28:47.650
It wouldn't work.

3580
02:28:47.650 --> 02:28:49.450
And I actually I talked to Matt about it

3581
02:28:49.450 --> 02:28:52.125
and he's like, it, "Ah, it would just--"

3582
02:28:52.989 --> 02:28:55.750
There's more that I want to explore with that.

3583
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:57.490
And I don't quite know what it is yet,

3584
02:28:57.490 --> 02:28:59.610
but I think where it sits right now,

3585
02:28:59.610 --> 02:29:01.110
I think it's just--

3586
02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:05.910
it's a form of therapy for her.

3587
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:07.606
BRIAN: I would like to thank Travis.

3588
02:29:07.606 --> 02:29:09.489
I would like to thank

3589
02:29:09.489 --> 02:29:11.855
Claudia Schiffer from the film Love Actually.

3590
02:29:11.855 --> 02:29:14.183
(cheering)

3591
02:29:14.183 --> 02:29:15.655
TRAVIS: You saved it for the end

3592
02:29:15.655 --> 02:29:17.710
and it is definitely--
DANI: That was a pull.

3593
02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:19.283
TRAVIS: -- the winner!
DANI: That was a pull.

3594
02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:20.116
TRAVIS: Wow!

3595
02:29:20.116 --> 02:29:23.280
It it totally Claudia Schiffer with Liam Neeson.

3596
02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:25.080
Oh my god.

3597
02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:26.650
DANI: She's in one scene.

3598
02:29:28.364 --> 02:29:31.206
ASHLEY: How?! How do you think of these?!

3599
02:29:31.206 --> 02:29:33.282
DANI: It was three minutes on camera.

3600
02:29:33.282 --> 02:29:35.699
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: You saved it.

3601
02:29:37.707 --> 02:29:40.457
(dramatic orchestral music)

3602
02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:37.080
MATT: Welcome back everyone.

3603
02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:42.960
Let me see if I have the information on our winner tonight.

3604
02:42:43.693 --> 02:42:45.130
It hasn't come yet, strangely.

3605
02:42:45.130 --> 02:42:47.670
SAM: Oh, interesting.
LAURA: Ooh.

3606
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:49.128
SAM: It's suspenseful.

3607
02:42:49.128 --> 02:42:51.759
MATT: It is, but when it arrives I will announce it.

3608
02:42:51.759 --> 02:42:53.092
SAM: Ooh man.

3609
02:42:54.035 --> 02:42:56.507
MATT: But that's okay, until then,

3610
02:42:56.507 --> 02:43:00.028
let's go ahead and jump into this story.

3611
02:43:00.028 --> 02:43:01.980
Yeah, we'll jump now into the episode.

3612
02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:03.610
totally fine.

3613
02:43:03.610 --> 02:43:05.567
All righty, so.

3614
02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:09.812
You both return, flying through the air

3615
02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:12.730
landing back on your ship

3616
02:43:12.730 --> 02:43:16.047
where the rest of your crew awaits, on day seven.

3617
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:20.760
LIAM: Hello.

3618
02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:22.180
LAURA: Hey, where were you guys?

3619
02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:23.205
LIAM: You know--

3620
02:43:23.205 --> 02:43:24.360
SAM: Did you find out anything?

3621
02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:25.850
LIAM: Over there.

3622
02:43:25.850 --> 02:43:28.330
MARISHA: Yeah, it appears to be the beacon that was stolen

3623
02:43:28.330 --> 02:43:29.330
not the beacon we saw on Pride's Call.

3624
02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:30.163
LAURA: You went and looked

3625
02:43:30.163 --> 02:43:32.270
at the beacon?
MARISHA: Yeah, we checked it out.

3626
02:43:32.270 --> 02:43:35.187
SAM: It's the one that was stolen from--

3627
02:43:36.130 --> 02:43:39.940
in-- when we saw it be stolen, no, we recovered that one.

3628
02:43:39.940 --> 02:43:40.995
TRAVIS: Yep, gave that back.

3629
02:43:40.995 --> 02:43:42.230
MARISHA: There were two.

3630
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:45.230
SAM: This one was stolen from where?

3631
02:43:45.230 --> 02:43:46.580
MARISHA: At the Dynasty.

3632
02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:48.110
SAM: When, did we witness this?

3633
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:50.610
MARISHA: Around the same time.
SAM: Around the same time, okay.

3634
02:43:50.610 --> 02:43:54.360
MARISHA: The one in Pride's Call we saw was smaller.

3635
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:57.120
SAM: So they still have an extra one that,

3636
02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:59.709
they that no one's accounted for?

3637
02:43:59.709 --> 02:44:02.630
TALIESIN: That they found buried, I believe.

3638
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:03.797
LIAM: Correct.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3639
02:44:04.650 --> 02:44:07.855
SAM: That's good, right?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

3640
02:44:07.855 --> 02:44:08.872
TALIESIN: Good as it can be.
LIAM: It's complicated,

3641
02:44:08.872 --> 02:44:12.160
but they seem, as best

3642
02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:14.810
Beauregard and I can tell

3643
02:44:14.810 --> 02:44:19.450
to be-- we couldn't find anything wrong with it.

3644
02:44:19.450 --> 02:44:20.690
And--
SAM: Well good,

3645
02:44:20.690 --> 02:44:22.660
I mean, as long as they

3646
02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:25.430
didn't give you anything to drink, I think we'll be okay.

3647
02:44:25.430 --> 02:44:27.597
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, that'd be bad.

3648
02:44:30.707 --> 02:44:32.310
MARISHA: Yeah, it went great.

3649
02:44:32.310 --> 02:44:33.340
SAM: Cool.

3650
02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:34.173
MARISHA: Yeah.

3651
02:44:34.173 --> 02:44:35.610
TRAVIS: We were attacked while you were away.

3652
02:44:35.610 --> 02:44:36.920
SAM: Yeah, fish people.

3653
02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:38.140
LIAM: More fish people?
LAURA: Lots of fish people.

3654
02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:39.100
TRAVIS: More prepared this time.

3655
02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:40.830
LIAM: We were only gone for like

3656
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:42.319
40 minutes.
MARISHA: 15 minutes, it's crazy.

3657
02:44:42.319 --> 02:44:44.027
SAM: Fjord threw up four more balls.
LAURA: Battles happen in

3658
02:44:44.027 --> 02:44:45.240
less than a minute, you guys,

3659
02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:46.910
like, it's in and out.
MARISHA: Wow.

3660
02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:48.743
TRAVIS: I'm like a Skee-Ball machine over here.

3661
02:44:48.743 --> 02:44:51.596
(gagging)
(laughter)

3662
02:44:51.596 --> 02:44:52.700
SAM: Some of them weren't even balls,

3663
02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:53.688
they were, like, triangles.

3664
02:44:53.688 --> 02:44:56.829
LIAM: Today's lotto number is 22.

3665
02:44:56.829 --> 02:44:57.912
TRAVIS: Like a great white shark.

3666
02:44:57.912 --> 02:45:01.147
LIAM: 16! Two!

3667
02:45:01.147 --> 02:45:01.980
MATT: There you go.

3668
02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:06.010
SAM: I think they're eggs. I think he's laying eggs.

3669
02:45:06.010 --> 02:45:07.677
TRAVIS: You know too much.

3670
02:45:09.451 --> 02:45:11.960
MARISHA: Also, there were some
pretty interesting interactions

3671
02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:15.450
and glances between Vess DeRogna and the Martinet.

3672
02:45:15.450 --> 02:45:17.220
LAURA: Oh, are they boning?

3673
02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:19.350
MARISHA: I think he definitely hates her.

3674
02:45:19.350 --> 02:45:20.470
(laughter)

3675
02:45:20.470 --> 02:45:21.430
TRAVIS: So yes.

3676
02:45:21.430 --> 02:45:23.530
MARISHA: Yeah, they might be hate fucking.

3677
02:45:23.530 --> 02:45:26.060
I mean, it's a good time.

3678
02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:27.890
If I do say so-- but that's not the point.

3679
02:45:27.890 --> 02:45:29.580
My point is--
SAM: It's just good color.

3680
02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:30.413
MARISHA: It's-- yeah.

3681
02:45:31.700 --> 02:45:35.220
It seems like she's running her own show,

3682
02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:40.220
separate from Ludinus Da'let-- Ludinet? The Martinet.

3683
02:45:40.375 --> 02:45:41.810
LIAM: Ludinus Da'leth.

3684
02:45:41.810 --> 02:45:44.210
There is a friction amongst all of them,

3685
02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:45.043
it seems like.

3686
02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:49.350
They are all vying for power for the Assembly,

3687
02:45:49.350 --> 02:45:52.440
but then within the Assembly, they're all vying for power.

3688
02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:53.800
MARISHA: Kind of threw her under the bus

3689
02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:56.620
by mentioning the job offer

3690
02:45:56.620 --> 02:45:58.060
that she gave us the other night.

3691
02:45:58.060 --> 02:45:59.170
LAURA: Ooh.

3692
02:45:59.170 --> 02:46:02.400
MARISHA: And The Martinet did not look too stoked.

3693
02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:04.380
SAM: Oh, nice. Nice work.

3694
02:46:04.380 --> 02:46:06.461
MARISHA: Just sewing a little, you know,

3695
02:46:06.461 --> 02:46:08.245
in-party fighting.
TRAVIS: Seeds of discord.

3696
02:46:08.245 --> 02:46:09.158
MARISHA: Yeah.

3697
02:46:09.158 --> 02:46:09.991
LIAM: So if you look at it right, it was

3698
02:46:09.991 --> 02:46:12.350
a complete and total victory.

3699
02:46:12.350 --> 02:46:16.660
LAURA: Is it normal? I mean, didn't...

3700
02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:18.950
Who was it that said that-- was it Yussa

3701
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:21.550
that said wizards have a hard time working with each other

3702
02:46:21.550 --> 02:46:23.290
because they're very powerful?

3703
02:46:23.290 --> 02:46:25.722
Or was that Halas?

3704
02:46:25.722 --> 02:46:27.305
LIAM: No, it was Yussa.

3705
02:46:28.324 --> 02:46:33.191
And ego plays a great part in it as well.

3706
02:46:35.006 --> 02:46:37.040
LAURA: Do you think, as you get more and more powerful,

3707
02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:39.670
you'll become, like, egotistical Caleb

3708
02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:42.290
instead of nice like you are now?

3709
02:46:42.290 --> 02:46:46.540
SAM: No, no, he's getting more and more warm every day.

3710
02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:48.200
MARISHA: He's nice?

3711
02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:50.260
SAM: Of course he's nice.

3712
02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:51.739
TALIESIN: He's very nice.

3713
02:46:51.739 --> 02:46:54.572
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm just fucking with you.

3714
02:46:55.613 --> 02:46:56.863
LIAM: I don't know.

3715
02:46:58.390 --> 02:47:00.950
LAURA: I think you should stay like you are.

3716
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:03.070
SAM: But get incrementally more powerful

3717
02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:04.190
until you can achieve your goals.

3718
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:05.190
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3719
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:07.460
MARISHA: If we recruited, like, another wizard

3720
02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:10.043
would you guys butt heads?

3721
02:47:10.043 --> 02:47:13.997
LIAM: Well, you know, Essek and I get along fairly well.

3722
02:47:13.997 --> 02:47:16.138
I think.
LAURA: That's true.

3723
02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:19.970
LIAM: And wizards I've known in the past, we did not butt--

3724
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:22.333
MARISHA: Heads.

3725
02:47:23.390 --> 02:47:25.420
Butt heads.
LAURA: You butted other things?

3726
02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:28.560
TALIESIN: Are you saying butt heads or buttheads?

3727
02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:29.393
MARISHA: Yeah.

3728
02:47:29.393 --> 02:47:30.226
LAURA: Or bump--

3729
02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:34.370
SAM: Speaking of wizards, I would love your help.

3730
02:47:34.370 --> 02:47:36.760
I've been working on a new spell.

3731
02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:37.593
LIAM: Oh, yes?

3732
02:47:37.593 --> 02:47:39.982
SAM: Yes and I would love your help at some point.

3733
02:47:39.982 --> 02:47:42.490
LIAM: My alarm bell's going off, tell me more.

3734
02:47:42.490 --> 02:47:44.650
SAM: No, I just started tinkering with it.

3735
02:47:44.650 --> 02:47:47.594
So maybe when we have a quiet moment, we can work on it.

3736
02:47:47.594 --> 02:47:49.701
LIAM: I'm curious to hear and to see.

3737
02:47:49.701 --> 02:47:51.640
SAM: Mm-hmm.

3738
02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:52.920
LIAM: Well, that's all I want to talk about now.

3739
02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:55.253
SAM: I mean yeah, but everyone's here then.

3740
02:47:55.253 --> 02:47:59.003
We have work to do on the ship so let's that's tallyho.

3741
02:48:00.330 --> 02:48:01.163
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: What?

3742
02:48:01.163 --> 02:48:05.395
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to go keep working on the--

3743
02:48:05.395 --> 02:48:06.711
TALIESIN: I'm going to boatswain, I guess.

3744
02:48:06.711 --> 02:48:08.652
LAURA: I'm going to wander off and stop working

3745
02:48:08.652 --> 02:48:10.123
on the repairs because it's boring.

3746
02:48:10.123 --> 02:48:11.257
MATT: Okay, checks out.

3747
02:48:11.257 --> 02:48:13.732
(laughter)

3748
02:48:13.732 --> 02:48:16.350
LAURA: I'm going to wander up and sit up in the crow's nest.

3749
02:48:16.350 --> 02:48:17.183
MATT: Okay.

3750
02:48:17.183 --> 02:48:18.440
TALIESIN: There are still pillows
and possibly some blood up there.

3751
02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:19.273
LAURA: Ooh!

3752
02:48:20.304 --> 02:48:21.137
TRAVIS: Fair bet.

3753
02:48:21.137 --> 02:48:22.822
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah.
MATT: Yep, most likely.

3754
02:48:22.822 --> 02:48:24.138
TALIESIN: Blood-stained pillows.

3755
02:48:25.041 --> 02:48:27.399
MATT: Well, the rest of the day goes on.

3756
02:48:27.399 --> 02:48:28.811
LAURA: I'm going to send a message.

3757
02:48:28.811 --> 02:48:30.380
MATT: Okay, send a message, the rest of the day

3758
02:48:30.380 --> 02:48:32.362
continues with Jester.

3759
02:48:32.362 --> 02:48:34.820
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to the messenger

3760
02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:37.158
that I summoned,

3761
02:48:37.158 --> 02:48:39.249
that's bringing the cupcakes.

3762
02:48:39.249 --> 02:48:41.780
TRAVIS: Oh, the running fucking 90 miles an hour.

3763
02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:46.590
LAURA: Hey, it's Jester, did you deliver the cupcakes?

3764
02:48:46.590 --> 02:48:49.490
I'm just wondering because I haven't heard from you

3765
02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:51.420
and then I realized we're at the sea

3766
02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:53.632
so you probably can't find me.

3767
02:48:53.632 --> 02:48:57.170
MATT: Okay, the spell that you cast was--
LIAM: (high-pitched) I'm on another plane of existence!

3768
02:48:57.170 --> 02:48:58.611
SAM: Gotta go fast.

3769
02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:01.890
MATT: Planar Ally, right?

3770
02:49:01.890 --> 02:49:03.173
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Finally [inaudible].

3771
02:49:05.062 --> 02:49:06.181
SAM: [inaudible]

3772
02:49:06.181 --> 02:49:07.410
TALIESIN: Planar Ally's such a fascinating spell.

3773
02:49:07.410 --> 02:49:09.010
MATT: There is no response.

3774
02:49:09.010 --> 02:49:13.440
LAURA: Okay, so they're probably either dead or they did it.

3775
02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:16.140
I'm going to send the message to the hag.

3776
02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:17.360
MATT: Okay.

3777
02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:19.020
SAM: Sure, sure.

3778
02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:22.190
LAURA: Hey, it's Jester, I sent you some cupcakes.

3779
02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:23.023
Did you get them?

3780
02:49:23.023 --> 02:49:28.023
Oh my gosh, they are black moss just like I promised you!

3781
02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:30.008
Are you thinking about...

3782
02:49:30.008 --> 02:49:31.439
(giggling)

3783
02:49:31.439 --> 02:49:34.356
(laughter)

3784
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:40.381
MATT: A moment passes before you hear,

3785
02:49:40.381 --> 02:49:43.939
"I did,

3786
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:47.965
"they were

3787
02:49:49.198 --> 02:49:51.839
"tasty.

3788
02:49:52.726 --> 02:49:57.726
"(heavy breathing)"

3789
02:49:57.918 --> 02:50:00.835
(laughter)

3790
02:50:02.133 --> 02:50:04.410
LAURA: I feel like I could feel a breath on my neck

3791
02:50:04.410 --> 02:50:08.827
as she was sending me a message, that's really weird.

3792
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:12.162
TALIESIN: Could be very bad.

3793
02:50:12.162 --> 02:50:13.960
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Six more messages.

3794
02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:16.197
LAURA: Yeah, one last thing.

3795
02:50:16.197 --> 02:50:17.940
(laughter)

3796
02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:20.198
Okay, so

3797
02:50:22.913 --> 02:50:27.346
I want to scry

3798
02:50:28.921 --> 02:50:30.877
on The Traveler.

3799
02:50:30.877 --> 02:50:31.752
SAM: Ooh.

3800
02:50:31.752 --> 02:50:33.174
MARISHA: Oh shit.

3801
02:50:33.174 --> 02:50:34.007
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: What?!

3802
02:50:34.965 --> 02:50:36.240
SAM: (quick back and forth movements)

3803
02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:38.184
(laughter)

3804
02:50:39.651 --> 02:50:40.874
TALIESIN: Dude!

3805
02:50:40.874 --> 02:50:43.491
TRAVIS: Feverishly beating it.

3806
02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:49.412
In the Feywild, just wank in a bank.

3807
02:50:52.430 --> 02:50:53.263
MATT: As you

3808
02:50:54.250 --> 02:50:55.800
sit down and set up your ritual

3809
02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:58.033
and begin

3810
02:50:59.090 --> 02:51:00.423
concentrating on

3811
02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:04.860
the divine gifts--
LAURA: This is hard, because he

3812
02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:07.387
gives me power.
MATT: -- that are granted to you by The Traveler,

3813
02:51:07.387 --> 02:51:08.220
(laughter)

3814
02:51:08.220 --> 02:51:11.210
you beseech him to take your vision

3815
02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:13.190
to show you The Traveler.

3816
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:16.340
As you sit there and complete your incantation,

3817
02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:17.960
all you hear in your ear is,

3818
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:21.690
"Curious."

3819
02:51:21.690 --> 02:51:22.523
LAURA: Oh shit.

3820
02:51:24.180 --> 02:51:26.110
I wasn't really thinking about that one.

3821
02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:28.326
MATT: "No, you were not."

3822
02:51:28.326 --> 02:51:30.828
LAURA: Look, okay, here's the thing.
MATT: That's all you hear.

3823
02:51:30.828 --> 02:51:33.030
(laughter)

3824
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:35.363
MARISHA: He just hang up on your ass.

3825
02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:41.309
LAURA: I just lay down on the crow's nest and take a nap.

3826
02:51:41.309 --> 02:51:43.176
TRAVIS: On the bloody pillows?

3827
02:51:43.176 --> 02:51:45.343
LAURA: I'm going to flip them over,

3828
02:51:46.260 --> 02:51:47.500
the bloody side down.

3829
02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:49.115
MATT: There you go.
TALIESIN: Unlocked his phone and--

3830
02:51:49.115 --> 02:51:52.806
LIAM: Are you purple with the sunburn when you wake up?

3831
02:51:53.983 --> 02:51:58.240
MATT: All right, so the rest of the day progresses

3832
02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:00.420
uneventful to the night.

3833
02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:03.675
The same preparations are made to rest safely.

3834
02:52:03.675 --> 02:52:06.490
TALIESIN: I'm going to add one more to it, actually.

3835
02:52:06.490 --> 02:52:09.280
This is something that I have
seen before, but I've never tried,

3836
02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:12.760
but I thought it might help you sleep a little better.

3837
02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:17.200
I take my staff and concentrate for a second,

3838
02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:20.030
say a couple words, tap it on the ground,

3839
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:23.480
and cast Guardian of Faith,

3840
02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:26.130
which is the spectral suit of armor

3841
02:52:26.130 --> 02:52:29.860
with a shield with the emblem of the earth,

3842
02:52:29.860 --> 02:52:33.460
of the earth mother out here and then and a giant sword

3843
02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:35.740
and it just crystal for where the head should

3844
02:52:35.740 --> 02:52:40.391
be, just a big amethyst crystal-- appears right by your bed.

3845
02:52:40.391 --> 02:52:42.150
SAM: What does that do?

3846
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:43.530
TALIESIN: It'll stay there till the morning

3847
02:52:43.530 --> 02:52:46.160
and if anything comes within

3848
02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:48.040
its very impressive reach,

3849
02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:50.680
it'll just start dealing with it.

3850
02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:55.568
TALIESIN: That's very thoughtful.
Thank you, Caduceus, conducive.

3851
02:52:55.568 --> 02:52:56.783
(chuckles)

3852
02:52:56.783 --> 02:53:00.544
Sort of distracted by the jewel face.
TALIESIN: The Wildmother is-- yeah.

3853
02:53:00.544 --> 02:53:03.870
Yeah, I haven't seen this done in quite a while.

3854
02:53:03.870 --> 02:53:07.545
TRAVIS: That's cool, okay, thank you.

3855
02:53:09.090 --> 02:53:12.530
TALIESIN: Just for for now while we're on the boat.

3856
02:53:12.530 --> 02:53:15.327
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: You'll be able to sleep?

3857
02:53:15.327 --> 02:53:17.860
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that's fine, it'll just stay there.

3858
02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:18.693
TRAVIS: Strange.

3859
02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:21.749
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: So we got

3860
02:53:21.749 --> 02:53:23.674
dome, we got an alarm, we got a crystal head,

3861
02:53:23.674 --> 02:53:25.340
we got monkey in the rigging.

3862
02:53:25.340 --> 02:53:27.891
LIAM: Yeah. Come at us, fish men.
LAURA: With Jester up in the crow's nest

3863
02:53:27.891 --> 02:53:29.860
because I'm still asleep in the crow's nest.

3864
02:53:29.860 --> 02:53:32.736
MATT: Yeah, Jester was the only one who's unprotected.

3865
02:53:32.736 --> 02:53:35.210
MARISHA: I go outside.
LIAM: We would see that.

3866
02:53:35.210 --> 02:53:38.280
MARISHA: And just like, look up and look around check

3867
02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:40.350
see if I see her.

3868
02:53:40.350 --> 02:53:41.880
MATT: Yeah, I mean, eventually you discern

3869
02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:42.713
that if Jester's missing from

3870
02:53:42.713 --> 02:53:44.620
everywhere else in the ship.
TRAVIS: Just a tiefling tail hanging over the side.

3871
02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:47.600
MATT: Yep, just curling, uncurling.

3872
02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:48.433
Yeah.

3873
02:53:48.433 --> 02:53:50.850
MARISHA: Jes! Jessie, are you asleep?

3874
02:53:54.407 --> 02:53:55.240
LAURA: Wow.

3875
02:53:58.257 --> 02:54:00.880
MARISHA: Don't roll out of bed.

3876
02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:01.713
LAURA: How long was I?

3877
02:54:01.713 --> 02:54:03.060
What time is it?

3878
02:54:03.060 --> 02:54:07.510
MARISHA: Ah, Caleb would know. He's not here,

3879
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:08.730
but we're getting ready to go to bed.

3880
02:54:08.730 --> 02:54:09.770
Do you want to come to bed?

3881
02:54:09.770 --> 02:54:11.170
Are you going to stay up there?

3882
02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:13.920
LAURA: Well, I just was sleeping.

3883
02:54:15.018 --> 02:54:16.360
MARISHA: Are you super awake now?

3884
02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:17.430
LAURA: No, I'm still tired.

3885
02:54:17.430 --> 02:54:18.770
I'm going to come down and go to bed.

3886
02:54:18.770 --> 02:54:19.603
MARISHA: Okay.

3887
02:54:20.716 --> 02:54:22.070
Be careful, it's dark.

3888
02:54:22.070 --> 02:54:23.220
Don't trip on your tail.

3889
02:54:23.220 --> 02:54:24.280
LAURA: Oh, my skin hurts.

3890
02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:27.700
MARISHA: You have a sunburn?

3891
02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:31.620
Oh, wow, it's weird, you get, like, a little purple-ish

3892
02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:34.039
when you get a sunburn.

3893
02:54:34.039 --> 02:54:35.040
Oh, it's super cute.

3894
02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:36.640
I mean, it's deadly.

3895
02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:38.380
You could get sick from that.

3896
02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:39.520
LAURA: It's bad for you, right?

3897
02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:40.353
MARISHA: Yeah.

3898
02:54:40.353 --> 02:54:42.020
LAURA: You know most tieflings can't get sunburns

3899
02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:44.360
because we're resistant to fire.

3900
02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:45.590
MARISHA: Interesting.

3901
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:46.757
LAURA: But I'm not.

3902
02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:50.740
MARISHA: Because you're blue and not red?

3903
02:54:50.740 --> 02:54:53.640
LAURA: I think it's because my dad--

3904
02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:55.270
MARISHA: Water, sweaty.

3905
02:54:56.470 --> 02:54:57.303
Yeah.

3906
02:54:58.560 --> 02:54:59.870
Well, you look good with little purple.

3907
02:54:59.870 --> 02:55:00.703
It's nice,
LAURA: Thanks.

3908
02:55:00.703 --> 02:55:02.040
MARISHA: You look healthy.

3909
02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:02.960
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

3910
02:55:05.070 --> 02:55:05.910
MARISHA: Okay, we should go to bed.

3911
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:08.030
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3912
02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.863
MATT: Okay.

3913
02:55:10.610 --> 02:55:11.770
First off, I do have the winner.

3914
02:55:11.770 --> 02:55:13.851
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: Eyy!

3915
02:55:13.851 --> 02:55:15.980
MATT: A little delayed there.
TRAVIS: The winner is called-- sabotage!

3916
02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:17.330
TALIESIN: Meanwhile you dream of a winner.

3917
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:18.163
MATT: It's all me.

3918
02:55:18.163 --> 02:55:19.050
I had it on airplane mode

3919
02:55:19.050 --> 02:55:20.540
and figured the text would come through

3920
02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:23.720
via the internet WiFi and it did not.

3921
02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:27.150
But the winner is Lady Lucara, Lady Lucara,

3922
02:55:27.150 --> 02:55:28.393
congratulations.

3923
02:55:28.393 --> 02:55:31.226
We'll get that sent to you ASAP.

3924
02:55:32.804 --> 02:55:33.637
SAM: Congrats.

3925
02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:38.230
MATT: So coming into the eighth day of your journey,

3926
02:55:38.230 --> 02:55:40.700
you're not too far from your destination.

3927
02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:43.130
The wind is picking up, however, in the morning

3928
02:55:43.130 --> 02:55:45.470
it is colder, a bit of marine layer has curled in,

3929
02:55:45.470 --> 02:55:46.830
but the wind is blowing in your favor

3930
02:55:46.830 --> 02:55:47.850
which does help you catch

3931
02:55:47.850 --> 02:55:50.550
a little bit of ground throughout the day.

3932
02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:54.190
Unless there's anything else you would want to

3933
02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:57.920
attempt on this day, we will continue onto the next,

3934
02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:01.460
as not every day of this journey is eventful.

3935
02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:02.670
Very well.
TALIESIN: We're good.

3936
02:56:02.670 --> 02:56:05.253
MATT: Continue on to the ninth day.

3937
02:56:08.564 --> 02:56:12.073
And on the 10th day on the horizon, you begin to see

3938
02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:16.270
a number of small shadows appear.

3939
02:56:16.270 --> 02:56:18.910
As you grow closer, they are ships.

3940
02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:21.968
As you grow closer,

3941
02:56:22.950 --> 02:56:26.197
it's pretty easy to tell this here before you is,

3942
02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:31.230
The Kryn Dynasty armada,

3943
02:56:31.230 --> 02:56:33.470
about a dozen or so vessels out there,

3944
02:56:33.470 --> 02:56:37.140
nearly all made of familiar purple wood

3945
02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:39.620
with gold detailing hoisting gray sails

3946
02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:42.680
that carry the familiar symbol of the Dynasty.

3947
02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:44.720
Within a certain radius, you can see the sky

3948
02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:47.678
suddenly takes a midnight hue.

3949
02:56:47.678 --> 02:56:51.140
TRAVIS: Oh, we'll bring that shit with them.

3950
02:56:51.140 --> 02:56:53.630
MATT: As the armada you're with grows closer,

3951
02:56:53.630 --> 02:56:55.060
at a certain point

3952
02:56:55.060 --> 02:56:58.468
you fall under this veil and the sun vanishes.

3953
02:56:58.468 --> 02:57:00.580
Though it may be,

3954
02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:02.820
we'll say, two o'clock in the afternoon,

3955
02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:05.487
it becomes pure midnight where you sail.

3956
02:57:06.450 --> 02:57:07.283
LIAM: From--

3957
02:57:09.610 --> 02:57:10.490
on all sides of us

3958
02:57:10.490 --> 02:57:11.540
at this point?
MATT: On all sides of you.

3959
02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:13.504
You pass through and eventually

3960
02:57:13.504 --> 02:57:16.139
just the sky is enveloped.

3961
02:57:16.139 --> 02:57:20.240
You hear gasps and whispers throughout the crew.

3962
02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.010
You can see a mirrored formation of ships

3963
02:57:23.010 --> 02:57:26.730
on their end and it begins to break at the front

3964
02:57:26.730 --> 02:57:30.840
as the Blue Heaven comes to the front line of the armada.

3965
02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:32.480
On the opposing side, you can see

3966
02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:36.520
a main Kryn ship begin to approach as well.

3967
02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:39.410
What was once two oval like

3968
02:57:39.410 --> 02:57:41.890
armadas as far as formation goes,

3969
02:57:41.890 --> 02:57:44.680
break into two triangles, flat end to flat end,

3970
02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:48.730
as they tend to merge and meet each other in a

3971
02:57:48.730 --> 02:57:52.280
guarded stalemate of military positioning.

3972
02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:55.620
The two lead ships come into contact.

3973
02:57:55.620 --> 02:58:00.530
You then watch as the lead Kryn ship that has approached.

3974
02:58:00.530 --> 02:58:03.540
Which, let's see here, the passive perception here,

3975
02:58:03.540 --> 02:58:06.790
Caduceus would probably be the one to notice it.

3976
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:09.510
you do not know Undercommon, do you?

3977
02:58:09.510 --> 02:58:11.620
TALIESIN: I do not know Undercommon, no.

3978
02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:14.800
MATT: You recognize that the ship has script on it,

3979
02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:16.711
but you cannot read it.

3980
02:58:16.711 --> 02:58:18.350
TALIESIN: No idea.

3981
02:58:18.350 --> 02:58:20.080
MATT: But approaches the Blue Heaven, they both

3982
02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:24.690
drop anchor right against each other as they coast close.

3983
02:58:24.690 --> 02:58:26.690
Now with them side to side,

3984
02:58:26.690 --> 02:58:28.680
plank walkways are set up between the two of them

3985
02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:31.910
and the stage of the negotiation is being set.

3986
02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.390
SAM: How far away are we?

3987
02:58:34.390 --> 02:58:36.656
MATT: You guys are, at this point,

3988
02:58:36.656 --> 02:58:39.630
probably 800 or so feet back

3989
02:58:39.630 --> 02:58:40.463
TRAVIS: 800?

3990
02:58:40.463 --> 02:58:44.184
MATT: Mm-hmm, closing in as the formation begins to tighten.

3991
02:58:44.184 --> 02:58:45.510
MARISHA: I speak Undercommon?

3992
02:58:45.510 --> 02:58:46.610
MATT: You do.

3993
02:58:46.610 --> 02:58:47.740
MARISHA: But I don't see anything?

3994
02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:49.200
MATT: You're not quite close enough yet to see the ship.

3995
02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:50.150
MARISHA: Okay.

3996
02:58:50.150 --> 02:58:51.560
SAM: Captain Tusktooth,

3997
02:58:51.560 --> 02:58:54.820
cannons are loaded and aimed at the ships.

3998
02:58:54.820 --> 02:58:57.410
TRAVIS: Which ships, because
they're right next to each other?

3999
02:58:57.410 --> 02:58:58.243
SAM: Yeah, both.

4000
02:58:58.243 --> 02:59:00.570
TRAVIS: You're prepared to take out both vessels?

4001
02:59:00.570 --> 02:59:01.970
SAM: If need be, sir.

4002
02:59:01.970 --> 02:59:04.430
TRAVIS: You are excellent at your job.

4003
02:59:04.430 --> 02:59:07.930
Stand fast, stay ready.

4004
02:59:07.930 --> 02:59:08.980
SAM: Aye aye, captain.

4005
02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:11.460
TRAVIS: Oh god, we're going to get him killed, okay.

4006
02:59:11.460 --> 02:59:12.293
MATT: All right.

4007
02:59:13.249 --> 02:59:14.082
All right.

4008
02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:18.460
You can see now between these two ships,

4009
02:59:18.460 --> 02:59:20.710
Lord Zeddan Graf approaches

4010
02:59:24.050 --> 02:59:27.000
and begins to meet with Kryn dignitaries

4011
02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:28.580
and the opposing side,

4012
02:59:28.580 --> 02:59:31.910
led on there and by the Dusk Captain,

4013
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:33.070
who you've recognized previously

4014
02:59:33.070 --> 02:59:35.370
as the hand of the Bright Queen.

4015
02:59:35.370 --> 02:59:39.410
Elite soldiers lead both sides,

4016
02:59:39.410 --> 02:59:42.050
the Wind of Aeons approaches,

4017
02:59:42.050 --> 02:59:45.070
but it does not get immediately close,

4018
02:59:45.070 --> 02:59:46.678
it doesn't need to.

4019
02:59:48.260 --> 02:59:51.300
You can see the conversations begin to ensue.

4020
02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:53.600
And eventually, a flag goes up

4021
02:59:53.600 --> 02:59:57.372
on the mast of each ship signifying the beginning

4022
02:59:58.250 --> 03:00:00.330
of these negotiations.

4023
03:00:00.330 --> 03:00:02.060
LAURA: Do we have a looking glass on our ship?

4024
03:00:02.060 --> 03:00:03.720
MARISHA: I have a looking glass.

4025
03:00:03.720 --> 03:00:05.430
LAURA: Let's look at what they're doing.

4026
03:00:05.430 --> 03:00:06.540
MARISHA: I bust out the looking glass.

4027
03:00:06.540 --> 03:00:07.730
SAM: I have a magnifying glass,

4028
03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:09.221
I can make it even more powerful.

4029
03:00:09.221 --> 03:00:11.933
MARISHA: No, you'll burn your retinas. Don't do that.

4030
03:00:11.933 --> 03:00:14.780
TALIESIN: We've got an eclipse, you don't want to do that.

4031
03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:17.750
MARISHA: I pull it out and I pass it around to everybody

4032
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:20.720
do the binoculars at a stadium thing.

4033
03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:23.670
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Orly has one as well so I'll share his.

4034
03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:24.503
MATT: Okay.

4035
03:00:25.450 --> 03:00:26.780
With that and the proximity

4036
03:00:26.780 --> 03:00:29.930
as the armada tightens in, you do

4037
03:00:29.930 --> 03:00:31.060
recognize the name of the ship

4038
03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:34.345
that is affixed to the Blue Heaven,

4039
03:00:34.345 --> 03:00:36.928
is the Vin-Radethak,

4040
03:00:36.928 --> 03:00:39.470
which is Undercommon for The Everstorm.

4041
03:00:39.470 --> 03:00:41.100
MARISHA and SAM: The Everstorm?

4042
03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:42.120
LAURA: That's cool.

4043
03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:43.264
MARISHA: That's dope.

4044
03:00:43.264 --> 03:00:45.140
LIAM: Vin-Radethak.

4045
03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:46.720
MATT: At this point, you can see all the ships

4046
03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:48.030
the Righteous Brand soldiers

4047
03:00:48.030 --> 03:00:50.590
are now coming to the decks as a show of power.

4048
03:00:50.590 --> 03:00:54.020
On the opposite end, you can see Aurora Watch soldiers

4049
03:00:54.020 --> 03:00:55.505
are coming to the decks as well

4050
03:00:55.505 --> 03:00:59.710
and there's very much a just a display of--

4051
03:00:59.710 --> 03:01:02.790
TRAVIS: Might.
MATT: -- tense might on both sides

4052
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:05.730
holding the line as the two center ships

4053
03:01:05.730 --> 03:01:08.207
become the core of what is to transpire.

4054
03:01:08.207 --> 03:01:10.992
TRAVIS: Play nice, play nice.

4055
03:01:10.992 --> 03:01:13.470
MARISHA: How close are we in in terms of, like,

4056
03:01:13.470 --> 03:01:15.180
is there a rough feet?

4057
03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:16.780
MATT: When the ship comes to a stop,

4058
03:01:16.780 --> 03:01:19.013
you're about 500 feet from them.

4059
03:01:20.450 --> 03:01:22.900
MARISHA: And there's no way we can get closer?

4060
03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:25.490
MATT: You could if you want to tell Orly

4061
03:01:25.490 --> 03:01:26.610
or the captain wants to push ahead.

4062
03:01:26.610 --> 03:01:27.890
LIAM: Yeah, I think we do.

4063
03:01:27.890 --> 03:01:29.390
SAM: Captain.

4064
03:01:29.390 --> 03:01:31.367
MARISHA: What do you say?

4065
03:01:31.367 --> 03:01:32.784
Maybe get closer?

4066
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:37.350
TRAVIS: What are the other ships doing?
SAM: We just maybe circle?

4067
03:01:37.350 --> 03:01:38.650
TRAVIS: Is there, like, a--

4068
03:01:38.650 --> 03:01:39.762
MATT: There is a formation.

4069
03:01:39.762 --> 03:01:41.420
TRAVIS: A halo, like, a distance that--

4070
03:01:41.420 --> 03:01:43.700
MATT: Yeah, they're keeping their distance from the ship.

4071
03:01:43.700 --> 03:01:45.519
And there is a network.

4072
03:01:45.519 --> 03:01:49.800
They've all hit a formation around it,

4073
03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:51.730
which is what your ship is currently maintaining

4074
03:01:51.730 --> 03:01:53.780
is the following the formation of other ships around,

4075
03:01:53.780 --> 03:01:54.890
you can break it if you want to.

4076
03:01:54.890 --> 03:01:56.750
TRAVIS: And just for a visual idea

4077
03:01:56.750 --> 03:01:57.583
if they're in the middle,

4078
03:01:57.583 --> 03:02:02.070
are the ships maintaining a clockwork pattern around it?

4079
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:04.290
MATT: Partially. There are almost two sides.

4080
03:02:04.290 --> 03:02:05.130
If you're seeing,

4081
03:02:05.130 --> 03:02:10.090
it is a loop around the two ships in the center.

4082
03:02:10.090 --> 03:02:11.500
It's two halves of the circle

4083
03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:13.480
are where the two armadas came together.

4084
03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:15.290
TRAVIS: And they're stopping, it's not constant movement?

4085
03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:16.140
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4086
03:02:16.140 --> 03:02:16.973
MATT: They're all stopping

4087
03:02:16.973 --> 03:02:19.070
and currently holding their position.

4088
03:02:19.070 --> 03:02:19.903
TRAVIS: No.

4089
03:02:19.903 --> 03:02:21.870
LAURA: How far out are we from their ship?

4090
03:02:21.870 --> 03:02:23.690
MATT: About 500 feet.

4091
03:02:23.690 --> 03:02:26.640
TRAVIS: Our range, so you know, is about 480,

4092
03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:28.190
so we would have to pick up and move

4093
03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:29.580
if we wanted to fire from a distance,

4094
03:02:29.580 --> 03:02:32.390
but if we move, so will they.

4095
03:02:32.390 --> 03:02:33.590
We really shouldn't do anything

4096
03:02:33.590 --> 03:02:36.140
unless we have to.

4097
03:02:36.140 --> 03:02:37.900
SAM: Get me 20 feet closer.

4098
03:02:39.270 --> 03:02:40.470
TRAVIS: Veth, just so you know.

4099
03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:44.388
If shit goes down,

4100
03:02:44.388 --> 03:02:48.160
I want you to pack the good powder.

4101
03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:48.993
Are we clear?

4102
03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:50.953
SAM: Yes?

4103
03:02:51.912 --> 03:02:54.829
(laughter)

4104
03:02:56.804 --> 03:02:59.990
TRAVIS: That is a thing that
you can do as the master gunner.

4105
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:01.560
SAM: Pack in the good powder.

4106
03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:02.393
TRAVIS: Yep.

4107
03:03:02.393 --> 03:03:04.100
You remember what that means, right?

4108
03:03:04.100 --> 03:03:04.933
ASHLEY: I feel like I

4109
03:03:04.933 --> 03:03:07.292
know what it means.
SAM: Yep.

4110
03:03:07.292 --> 03:03:08.860
ASHLEY: I don't have a job on the ship yet,

4111
03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:10.330
but I feel like I know what it means.

4112
03:03:10.330 --> 03:03:11.770
TRAVIS: I feel like you should maybe

4113
03:03:11.770 --> 03:03:14.680
stick with Veth and just, you know, oversee--

4114
03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:15.540
ASHLEY: Pack the good powder?

4115
03:03:15.540 --> 03:03:16.930
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4116
03:03:16.930 --> 03:03:18.300
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll help you.

4117
03:03:18.300 --> 03:03:19.790
SAM: I'm the powder monkey, though.

4118
03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:21.360
So what's Yasha?

4119
03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:24.910
TRAVIS: You can teach Yasha what that means.

4120
03:03:24.910 --> 03:03:26.010
SAM: Co-monkeys?

4121
03:03:26.010 --> 03:03:27.150
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4122
03:03:27.150 --> 03:03:30.610
ASHLEY: Co-monkeys? Cool.
SAM: Yep. All right.

4123
03:03:30.610 --> 03:03:34.400
MARISHA: Is Frumpkin still a monkey?
Is there a trio of monkeys?

4124
03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:35.470
SAM: Yep.

4125
03:03:35.470 --> 03:03:37.020
TALIESIN: Can you actually teach a monkey

4126
03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:38.700
to be a powder monkey or is that?

4127
03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:40.117
SAM: We'll find out.
LIAM: Mine can.

4128
03:03:40.953 --> 03:03:42.352
ASHLEY: It's like co-jaegering--

4129
03:03:42.352 --> 03:03:44.681
LAURA: I'm watching through the looking glass

4130
03:03:44.681 --> 03:03:47.150
while everyone's talking.

4131
03:03:47.150 --> 03:03:47.983
MATT: All right.

4132
03:03:49.470 --> 03:03:51.330
As you watch, you can see

4133
03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:54.440
other figures that appear to be members

4134
03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:56.690
of higher noble station

4135
03:03:56.690 --> 03:04:00.050
joining in flanking the sides of the Dusk Captain.

4136
03:04:00.050 --> 03:04:04.740
You can see Ludinus is now joining the

4137
03:04:04.740 --> 03:04:06.906
right hand shoulder of Lord Zeddan Graf.

4138
03:04:06.906 --> 03:04:08.906
LAURA: Oh, Ludinus is there.

4139
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:11.820
I'm just letting everyone know.

4140
03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:12.653
MATT: You got it.

4141
03:04:12.653 --> 03:04:14.470
TRAVIS: With my spyglass,

4142
03:04:14.470 --> 03:04:16.000
of that circle--
TALIESIN: We have two?

4143
03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:17.060
TRAVIS: Knowing that they're in the middle--

4144
03:04:17.060 --> 03:04:18.560
SAM: Oh, pack the good powder, it's right here!

4145
03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:19.910
TRAVIS: Let's say it's a clock.

4146
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:22.170
Are we at three o'clock, six, nine o'clock?

4147
03:04:22.170 --> 03:04:25.190
Are we on the left or right of that meeting area?

4148
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:26.190
MATT: If you're looking,

4149
03:04:28.690 --> 03:04:30.500
if the division line between them

4150
03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:34.350
is the three o'clock to nine o'clock,

4151
03:04:34.350 --> 03:04:37.070
upper part is the Kryn dynasty, and we'll say

4152
03:04:37.070 --> 03:04:41.840
the bottom half is the Empire and the Clovis Concord.

4153
03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:44.660
You guys would be at the

4154
03:04:44.660 --> 03:04:45.770
five o'clock.

4155
03:04:45.770 --> 03:04:47.970
TRAVIS: We are fucking back there, aren't we?

4156
03:04:47.970 --> 03:04:48.803
Okay.

4157
03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:53.360
At the nine o'clock and three o'clock positions,

4158
03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:54.450
can I just check to see

4159
03:04:54.450 --> 03:04:57.610
what the Dynasty side ships look like they're doing?

4160
03:04:57.610 --> 03:05:01.030
Can I check their port holes, can I check their decks?

4161
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.940
Are they armed?

4162
03:05:01.940 --> 03:05:03.840
Are they more for show?

4163
03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:04.890
MATT: They're all armed.

4164
03:05:04.890 --> 03:05:06.720
You can see they all have, much like

4165
03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:08.100
all your ships, so weapons are on display

4166
03:05:08.100 --> 03:05:08.950
the gun holds are down.

4167
03:05:08.950 --> 03:05:11.480
There's definitely a, this is a peace talk,

4168
03:05:11.480 --> 03:05:14.280
but everyone's also making sure

4169
03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:16.400
that the other side knows that they're ready to defend

4170
03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:17.560
if anything goes poorly.

4171
03:05:17.560 --> 03:05:18.760
Very much this

4172
03:05:19.690 --> 03:05:22.510
tense, neutral ground with the outside threat

4173
03:05:22.510 --> 03:05:25.540
of any foul play, we'll attack.

4174
03:05:27.630 --> 03:05:29.480
TRAVIS: Last question, are there any ships,

4175
03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:31.930
in just a scan across, knowing that the vision is limited,

4176
03:05:31.930 --> 03:05:33.140
are there any ships that are

4177
03:05:33.140 --> 03:05:36.320
empty of crew on top of the deck?

4178
03:05:36.320 --> 03:05:37.710
MATT: Currently, no.

4179
03:05:37.710 --> 03:05:38.750
TRAVIS: Okay.

4180
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:39.583
MATT: They all have crew

4181
03:05:39.583 --> 03:05:43.230
or they have, almost every deck has soldiers on it

4182
03:05:43.230 --> 03:05:44.647
except for yours.

4183
03:05:45.740 --> 03:05:46.858
Everyone else is approved armada

4184
03:05:46.858 --> 03:05:48.360
and has a military presence on the deck

4185
03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:49.770
as well as crew members.

4186
03:05:49.770 --> 03:05:51.005
TRAVIS: Okay.

4187
03:05:51.005 --> 03:05:53.770
MATT: Everything's out for show right now.

4188
03:05:53.770 --> 03:05:55.180
Weirdly enough, a figure

4189
03:05:55.180 --> 03:05:57.460
steps up from below your deck.

4190
03:05:57.460 --> 03:05:58.440
You see a

4191
03:05:59.880 --> 03:06:02.570
what looks to be an elven figure with blond hair.

4192
03:06:02.570 --> 03:06:04.361
This is Lord Dezran.

4193
03:06:04.361 --> 03:06:08.260
This is Essek in his illusory form.

4194
03:06:08.260 --> 03:06:09.093
TRAVIS: Ah.

4195
03:06:09.093 --> 03:06:09.960
LAURA: Is he with us?

4196
03:06:09.960 --> 03:06:11.270
MATT: Yeah, steps up from below your deck.

4197
03:06:11.270 --> 03:06:13.640
TALIESIN: Hey.
LAURA: When did you get here?

4198
03:06:13.640 --> 03:06:15.740
MATT: "I arrived but a few moments ago."

4199
03:06:15.740 --> 03:06:17.740
MARISHA: Why do people keep bamfing onto our ship

4200
03:06:17.740 --> 03:06:18.573
without permission?

4201
03:06:18.573 --> 03:06:20.050
SAM: We do that a lot to other people.

4202
03:06:20.050 --> 03:06:21.340
MARISHA: You're not wrong, it's fair.

4203
03:06:21.340 --> 03:06:22.980
LAURA: It's good to see you.

4204
03:06:22.980 --> 03:06:23.920
MATT: "You as well.

4205
03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:28.450
"It is best that I am nowhere near these negotiations.

4206
03:06:28.450 --> 03:06:31.130
"The Martinet has the beacon's transference handled.

4207
03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:33.220
"I'm just here to

4208
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:35.980
"be watchful."

4209
03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:37.250
LAURA: Will they know it's you?

4210
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:40.170
Like will the people on the other side--

4211
03:06:40.170 --> 03:06:42.750
MATT: "There are many wards placed around

4212
03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:44.550
"the proximity of this negotiation,

4213
03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:47.330
"I'm certain, so I would not wish to put myself

4214
03:06:47.330 --> 03:06:49.580
"in a precarious situation.

4215
03:06:49.580 --> 03:06:53.570
"I figured this was the safest place to be.

4216
03:06:53.570 --> 03:06:54.710
"If you don't mind."

4217
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:56.776
TALIESIN: Borrow that spyglass for a little bit.

4218
03:06:56.776 --> 03:06:57.776
TRAVIS: Of course.

4219
03:06:58.894 --> 03:06:59.980
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep an eye.

4220
03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:02.580
I want to slowly pan through the other ships,

4221
03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:03.590
not the two main ones.

4222
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:06.830
I just want to look for anything unusual or anybody.

4223
03:07:06.830 --> 03:07:07.870
MATT: Okay.

4224
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:09.020
Roll a perception check for me.

4225
03:07:09.020 --> 03:07:10.520
TALIESIN: Just in general.

4226
03:07:13.860 --> 03:07:14.693
21.

4227
03:07:14.693 --> 03:07:16.460
MATT: 21, okay, looking around,

4228
03:07:16.460 --> 03:07:18.160
you can see there are all forms of

4229
03:07:19.090 --> 03:07:21.470
deck side ballista that are

4230
03:07:22.470 --> 03:07:26.000
armed, but not aimed yet.

4231
03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.780
You can see, at the front of some ships,

4232
03:07:28.780 --> 03:07:30.830
there are figures that appear to be,

4233
03:07:30.830 --> 03:07:34.755
at least, magic practitioners on display.

4234
03:07:35.650 --> 03:07:37.550
Everyone is fully armored

4235
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:39.540
and just at the ready.

4236
03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:40.373
TALIESIN: Right.

4237
03:07:40.373 --> 03:07:42.790
MATT: You do not see any sort of
funny business at the moment.

4238
03:07:42.790 --> 03:07:44.440
TALIESIN: No funny business, all right.

4239
03:07:45.350 --> 03:07:46.183
MATT: But

4240
03:07:47.140 --> 03:07:49.030
everyone's as tense as you'd expect,

4241
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:51.030
given the circumstances.

4242
03:07:52.410 --> 03:07:53.471
LIAM: May I?

4243
03:07:53.471 --> 03:07:54.680
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

4244
03:07:54.680 --> 03:07:57.930
LIAM: I want to see who is standing and representing

4245
03:07:57.930 --> 03:08:00.710
for the Empire on their ship.

4246
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:05.710
MATT: Okay, you see the
Dusk Captain is the primary conversant,

4247
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:07.740
the two figures to the right and left of her,

4248
03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:09.660
you do not recognize.

4249
03:08:09.660 --> 03:08:12.550
But they are they're both drow.

4250
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:15.490
And they're conversing back and forth.

4251
03:08:15.490 --> 03:08:17.010
You can now see, at this point,

4252
03:08:17.010 --> 03:08:20.370
soldiers are bringing up, from two opposite sides,

4253
03:08:21.680 --> 03:08:24.577
looks like large metallic boards

4254
03:08:25.488 --> 03:08:28.225
and then you realize they're mirrors.

4255
03:08:28.225 --> 03:08:30.660
A mirror placed on one ship

4256
03:08:30.660 --> 03:08:31.850
and a mirror on the other.

4257
03:08:31.850 --> 03:08:32.683
MARISHA: Yeah.

4258
03:08:33.570 --> 03:08:35.540
MATT: Upon this center space between the two

4259
03:08:35.540 --> 03:08:38.630
where this heavy gangplank has been assembled

4260
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:41.000
slowly over a period of an hour or so,

4261
03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.060
there is now an open walkway,

4262
03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:46.550
like a 20 by 20 foot portion of

4263
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:49.700
solid deck between these two ships

4264
03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:52.630
and mirrors are placed there along with the chairs

4265
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:54.770
and this is where the discussion is to happen.

4266
03:08:57.250 --> 03:08:59.590
SAM: Chairs.

4267
03:08:59.590 --> 03:09:02.049
TRAVIS: Caleb, what form is Frumpkin in right now?

4268
03:09:02.049 --> 03:09:03.540
LIAM: He's a monkey.

4269
03:09:04.900 --> 03:09:06.570
MATT: At this distance, you can begin to see now

4270
03:09:06.570 --> 03:09:08.020
the mirrors begin to shimmer.

4271
03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.090
And from the perspective that you have,

4272
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:12.710
you cannot quite see the

4273
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:14.180
one that's facing away from your ship,

4274
03:09:14.180 --> 03:09:16.090
but the one that's facing this direction,

4275
03:09:16.090 --> 03:09:17.580
you gather with a couple of glances

4276
03:09:17.580 --> 03:09:19.030
and the angle that you're at:

4277
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:20.790
You can see the Bright Queen,

4278
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:24.207
her visage appearing on the other mirror.

4279
03:09:26.709 --> 03:09:28.725
LIAM: I feel like we should be there.

4280
03:09:28.725 --> 03:09:29.558
MARISHA: I know.

4281
03:09:31.450 --> 03:09:33.430
Do a few of us need to get closer?

4282
03:09:33.430 --> 03:09:35.290
We've got Water Breathing.

4283
03:09:35.290 --> 03:09:37.350
TALIESIN: I don't know if we should.

4284
03:09:37.350 --> 03:09:40.440
LAURA: They've got a lot of wards, you know.

4285
03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:41.910
TALIESIN: Yeah and if we get,

4286
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:44.360
if we even rattle that, the whole thing falls apart.

4287
03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:46.560
Let's just see if it crows on its own.

4288
03:09:46.560 --> 03:09:48.060
MATT: "Do not think you are the only ship

4289
03:09:48.060 --> 03:09:49.868
"keeping a very close eye

4290
03:09:49.868 --> 03:09:52.858
"on every other ship on this armada."

4291
03:09:52.858 --> 03:09:55.330
TRAVIS: Plus, it's 500 feet. You'd be trapped in the middle

4292
03:09:55.330 --> 03:09:56.340
take you too long to get there

4293
03:09:56.340 --> 03:10:00.168
and if something happened, you'd be stuck.

4294
03:10:00.168 --> 03:10:02.298
MATT: "Do as you will, but--"

4295
03:10:03.273 --> 03:10:05.440
SAM: I can just walk over there.

4296
03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:07.340
LAURA: Yeah, that would go well.

4297
03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:08.510
SAM: I can be invisible.

4298
03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:09.960
TRAVIS: The only problem really not looking at--

4299
03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:10.793
LAURA: They have wards,

4300
03:10:10.793 --> 03:10:13.310
they would know that there was not really, you know,

4301
03:10:14.657 --> 03:10:15.760
they would be able to see you.

4302
03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:18.704
ASHLEY: They'd probably be able to see.

4303
03:10:18.704 --> 03:10:20.230
TRAVIS: I think the only thing that's not being watched

4304
03:10:20.230 --> 03:10:21.570
is beneath us.

4305
03:10:21.570 --> 03:10:22.403
That's it.

4306
03:10:25.657 --> 03:10:26.840
I don't know how to remedy that.

4307
03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:28.440
I think we're here for the show.

4308
03:10:32.430 --> 03:10:33.490
SAM: By the way, Captain,

4309
03:10:33.490 --> 03:10:35.950
Yasha reminded me what "pack the good powder" means.

4310
03:10:35.950 --> 03:10:37.830
I think we're all set.
TRAVIS: Oh, you reminded Yasha

4311
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:39.220
of what they--
SAM: No, Yasha reminded me.

4312
03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:40.690
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

4313
03:10:40.690 --> 03:10:41.523
SAM: So we're all good.

4314
03:10:41.523 --> 03:10:44.310
TRAVIS: Is the good powder packed, Master Gunner?

4315
03:10:44.310 --> 03:10:45.530
Did you--
ASHLEY: The powder is packed--

4316
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:49.050
SAM: Co-monkey, co-monkey reports a fine packing.

4317
03:10:49.050 --> 03:10:49.883
TRAVIS: Of the good powder?

4318
03:10:49.883 --> 03:10:50.870
SAM: Of the good powder.

4319
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:55.620
ASHLEY: And they have been--
each of the wads have been prepped.

4320
03:10:56.570 --> 03:10:57.650
MARISHA: Wow.

4321
03:10:57.650 --> 03:11:00.630
Yeah, what the fuck, Veth?

4322
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:01.560
SAM: She's a natural.

4323
03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:02.440
MARISHA: Yeah.

4324
03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:04.060
SAM: She's a killing machine over there.

4325
03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:08.340
TRAVIS: Yasha, do you have
extensive experience on the water?

4326
03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:10.295
ASHLEY: No.

4327
03:11:10.295 --> 03:11:13.212
(laughter)

4328
03:11:14.330 --> 03:11:16.483
I do not.

4329
03:11:16.483 --> 03:11:18.738
SAM: She didn't have harp experience, either.

4330
03:11:18.738 --> 03:11:20.130
LAURA: She's just good.
SAM: She's just good,

4331
03:11:20.130 --> 03:11:21.170
she's a fast learner.

4332
03:11:21.170 --> 03:11:22.670
LAURA: She picks things up, you know.

4333
03:11:22.670 --> 03:11:23.503
ASHLEY: I do it, yeah,

4334
03:11:23.503 --> 03:11:24.440
I have experienced packing.

4335
03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:26.730
TALIESIN: You do pack, you're very good at packing.

4336
03:11:26.730 --> 03:11:27.660
ASHLEY: Definitely packing, yeah.

4337
03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:28.600
SAM: She learned how to knit

4338
03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:31.274
while we've been sailing in the last three days.

4339
03:11:31.274 --> 03:11:33.380
TRAVIS: Any other languages?

4340
03:11:33.380 --> 03:11:35.458
ASHLEY: Not yet, but we'll see.

4341
03:11:35.458 --> 03:11:37.267
TRAVIS: Nein!

4342
03:11:37.267 --> 03:11:38.350
TALIESIN: Pig Common.

4343
03:11:39.282 --> 03:11:41.656
MARISHA: (laughs) Pig Common.

4344
03:11:42.579 --> 03:11:44.042
TRAVIS: About what time is it?

4345
03:11:44.042 --> 03:11:46.750
MATT: At this point, it's, well, it's hard to tell.

4346
03:11:46.750 --> 03:11:49.740
It's just perpetual midnight where you currently stand.

4347
03:11:49.740 --> 03:11:51.890
LIAM: But if remember every hour of the day

4348
03:11:51.890 --> 03:11:52.820
leading up to this moment?

4349
03:11:52.820 --> 03:11:55.130
MATT: Correct, you keeping tabs on it. At this point,

4350
03:11:55.130 --> 03:11:57.360
I'd say, as time progresses into the afternoon,

4351
03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:00.960
these negotiation talks go on for a few hours.

4352
03:12:00.960 --> 03:12:04.300
Lanterns are lit across the decks of the ships

4353
03:12:04.300 --> 03:12:09.300
to give this still slightly swaying with the waves

4354
03:12:09.410 --> 03:12:12.800
firefly light-type look across both armadas

4355
03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:14.510
as they meet on that edge.

4356
03:12:14.510 --> 03:12:17.070
TRAVIS: Just for color, if a sun was in the sky

4357
03:12:17.070 --> 03:12:19.850
and the Dynasty fleet came forward

4358
03:12:19.850 --> 03:12:22.380
does the sun appear in the night sky,

4359
03:12:22.380 --> 03:12:25.870
but just without light, or does it disappear?

4360
03:12:25.870 --> 03:12:27.550
MATT: Currently, looking up,

4361
03:12:27.550 --> 03:12:30.230
you can see the outline of where the sun would be.

4362
03:12:30.230 --> 03:12:34.498
But it appears to look like a very dull moon.

4363
03:12:34.498 --> 03:12:37.680
(laughter)
ASHLEY: That's so cool.

4364
03:12:37.680 --> 03:12:38.910
TALIESIN: I wish I had that.

4365
03:12:38.910 --> 03:12:41.093
LAURA: Hey, Essek. I mean, sorry.

4366
03:12:41.093 --> 03:12:42.951
Should did not call you that?

4367
03:12:42.951 --> 03:12:47.340
MATT: "In mixed company, it would
not be preferred. Yes, please."

4368
03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:48.965
LAURA: Hey.

4369
03:12:48.965 --> 03:12:50.240
(laughter)

4370
03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:51.990
Can you scry on them?

4371
03:12:53.220 --> 03:12:55.840
MATT: "I would probably say,

4372
03:12:55.840 --> 03:12:57.680
"I would prefer not to."

4373
03:12:57.680 --> 03:12:59.170
LAURA: Would they know that you're scrying?

4374
03:12:59.170 --> 03:13:01.590
MATT: "They would know they are being scryed upon

4375
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:03.330
"if they have the right wards,

4376
03:13:03.330 --> 03:13:07.540
"which I have to assume they have every sort of ward

4377
03:13:07.540 --> 03:13:10.190
"present on this for that reason."

4378
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:11.720
LAURA: How do we hear?

4379
03:13:11.720 --> 03:13:14.053
MATT: "We don't, we trust--"
LAURA: This is really boring,

4380
03:13:15.320 --> 03:13:17.990
without knowing what they're saying.

4381
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:19.165
MATT: "Jester."
LAURA: Huh?

4382
03:13:19.165 --> 03:13:20.430
MATT: "Welcome to politics."

4383
03:13:20.430 --> 03:13:22.530
LAURA: Oh, I hate politics.

4384
03:13:22.530 --> 03:13:25.790
TRAVIS: Jester, boring is good. Also,

4385
03:13:25.790 --> 03:13:28.740
not boring is, with this many people,

4386
03:13:28.740 --> 03:13:31.260
probably not.

4387
03:13:31.260 --> 03:13:34.507
LAURA: That's actually a really a point.

4388
03:13:34.507 --> 03:13:36.010
(heavy sighing)

4389
03:13:36.010 --> 03:13:37.750
MATT: The hours progress

4390
03:13:37.750 --> 03:13:41.060
until what would probably be early evening.

4391
03:13:41.060 --> 03:13:42.060
And then at a point,

4392
03:13:43.090 --> 03:13:44.810
people leave their chairs.

4393
03:13:44.810 --> 03:13:46.370
The mirrors are taken.

4394
03:13:46.370 --> 03:13:48.890
And it looks like the negotiations for the day have ended.

4395
03:13:48.890 --> 03:13:49.910
MARISHA: For the day.

4396
03:13:49.910 --> 03:13:51.970
MATT: There's no signs of completion.

4397
03:13:51.970 --> 03:13:53.170
There's no movement of any ships.

4398
03:13:53.170 --> 03:13:55.923
MARISHA: There's been no handoff of beacons or prisoners?

4399
03:13:55.923 --> 03:13:56.756
MATT: Not yet.

4400
03:13:56.756 --> 03:13:57.589
TRAVIS: No one said this is a

4401
03:13:57.589 --> 03:13:58.610
one day thing.

4402
03:13:58.610 --> 03:14:02.710
TALIESIN: There's only so much food--
LAURA: How long until Traveler Con?

4403
03:14:04.253 --> 03:14:08.753
MATT: You have somewhere from this point in time, I'd say,

4404
03:14:10.101 --> 03:14:12.101
looking through my details here.

4405
03:14:13.890 --> 03:14:15.130
Roughly two weeks.

4406
03:14:15.130 --> 03:14:16.845
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, we got time.

4407
03:14:16.845 --> 03:14:19.140
MARISHA: And how far away are we from Rumblecusp?

4408
03:14:19.140 --> 03:14:21.160
MATT: From your current meeting here,

4409
03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:23.140
you're about a six to nine day journey,

4410
03:14:23.140 --> 03:14:25.130
if you go above the Inkclaw Reef

4411
03:14:25.130 --> 03:14:26.930
or about an eight to 10 day journey

4412
03:14:26.930 --> 03:14:28.310
on the southern side of the Inkclaw Reef.

4413
03:14:28.310 --> 03:14:30.530
MARISHA: Okay, six to nine or eight to 10?

4414
03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:31.413
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: All right.

4415
03:14:31.413 --> 03:14:32.246
MARISHA: Okay.

4416
03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:35.320
All right.

4417
03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:36.900
MATT: So you've got over two weeks before it happens.

4418
03:14:36.900 --> 03:14:37.843
You have time.

4419
03:14:37.843 --> 03:14:39.768
TRAVIS: We've got about a week for this to conclude.

4420
03:14:39.768 --> 03:14:43.018
MATT: Until this runs into that time, yeah.

4421
03:14:44.838 --> 03:14:48.700
LIAM: How would you like to
send a message to the Bright Queen?

4422
03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:50.840
LAURA: Oh, my god, I was thinking about doing that.

4423
03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:52.323
SAM: But she's in the middle of a negotiation.

4424
03:14:52.323 --> 03:14:54.200
LAURA: No, she just finished, she's not talking.

4425
03:14:54.200 --> 03:14:55.960
What should I ask her?

4426
03:14:55.960 --> 03:14:57.070
Be like, "How's it going?"

4427
03:14:57.070 --> 03:14:59.860
LIAM: How's it going is the first thing to ask, yeah.

4428
03:14:59.860 --> 03:15:03.010
Does she feel it's going well? Does she trust that

4429
03:15:03.010 --> 03:15:06.557
it is going to reach completion smoothly?

4430
03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:08.940
Just an update.

4431
03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:10.140
LAURA: Yeah.

4432
03:15:10.140 --> 03:15:12.890
I'm sure she's, totally wants to talk to me.

4433
03:15:12.890 --> 03:15:13.900
LIAM: No, she does not, but I think

4434
03:15:13.900 --> 03:15:15.660
it's a good idea.
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to her.

4435
03:15:15.660 --> 03:15:16.493
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Sure.

4436
03:15:16.493 --> 03:15:19.280
(laughter)

4437
03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:21.320
LAURA: Oh, we took a long rest.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

4438
03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:22.710
MATT: You did the night before, yeah.

4439
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:24.030
LIAM: Oh, we took a long rest.

4440
03:15:24.030 --> 03:15:25.520
LAURA: Oh, we took a long rest.

4441
03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:26.660
MATT: You're right.

4442
03:15:26.660 --> 03:15:30.435
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to the Bright Queen.

4443
03:15:30.435 --> 03:15:32.450
Oh my gosh, I could see you in the mirror.

4444
03:15:32.450 --> 03:15:35.050
You looked so beautiful.

4445
03:15:35.050 --> 03:15:36.840
What

4446
03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:37.870
were you guys saying?

4447
03:15:37.870 --> 03:15:40.453
Did it go well? Are you happy?

4448
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:44.571
MATT: "I am in the middle of a discussion,

4449
03:15:44.571 --> 03:15:46.610
"but I will respond

4450
03:15:46.610 --> 03:15:49.830
"that things are progressing as expected.

4451
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:52.538
"Not poorly yet."

4452
03:15:54.180 --> 03:15:56.230
LAURA: She thinks they're going decent.

4453
03:15:56.230 --> 03:15:59.088
"Not poorly yet," she says.
LIAM: Okay.

4454
03:16:00.130 --> 03:16:03.983
LAURA: Don't, I do not think
she wants me to send another message.

4455
03:16:03.983 --> 03:16:07.018
TALIESIN: What does Orly have to do with this?

4456
03:16:07.018 --> 03:16:08.593
LAURA: Heh. I don't think

4457
03:16:08.593 --> 03:16:10.960
that she--
LIAM: We won't push it.

4458
03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:11.793
LAURA: Okay.

4459
03:16:11.793 --> 03:16:12.670
LIAM: Maybe one day at a time.

4460
03:16:12.670 --> 03:16:14.690
LAURA: Should I send a message to King Dwendal

4461
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:15.870
and find out what he thinks?

4462
03:16:15.870 --> 03:16:17.761
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

4463
03:16:18.800 --> 03:16:21.511
How did negotiations fall apart?

4464
03:16:21.511 --> 03:16:23.087
(laughter)

4465
03:16:23.087 --> 03:16:26.530
LIAM: We didn't have as good a relationship, I feel,

4466
03:16:26.530 --> 03:16:28.430
with King Dwendal.
LAURA: It's true.

4467
03:16:28.430 --> 03:16:30.007
LAURA: What about Martinet?

4468
03:16:30.007 --> 03:16:30.840
LIAM: Yeah.

4469
03:16:30.840 --> 03:16:32.704
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Martinet.

4470
03:16:32.704 --> 03:16:34.280
TALIESIN: Okay, there we go.

4471
03:16:34.280 --> 03:16:35.730
Yeah.

4472
03:16:35.730 --> 03:16:37.620
LAURA: Hey, so you were there!

4473
03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:39.130
Oh my gosh, what happened?

4474
03:16:39.130 --> 03:16:40.350
What did they say?

4475
03:16:40.350 --> 03:16:45.252
We're just so curious. I really want to know

4476
03:16:47.050 --> 03:16:48.179
how?

4477
03:16:48.179 --> 03:16:51.096
(laughter)

4478
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:55.820
MATT: "It seems,

4479
03:16:57.800 --> 03:16:59.570
"things are open to

4480
03:17:01.650 --> 03:17:05.390
"progression in the morrow.

4481
03:17:05.390 --> 03:17:08.060
"The ice has been broken.

4482
03:17:08.060 --> 03:17:09.860
"Nobody's killed each other.

4483
03:17:10.810 --> 03:17:12.502
"I call that a win."

4484
03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:16.240
LAURA: He used the good amount of words

4485
03:17:16.240 --> 03:17:17.130
in the response

4486
03:17:17.130 --> 03:17:20.696
and he says it was going really good.

4487
03:17:21.750 --> 03:17:26.140
MARISHA: Where's not-Essek? Is he still on the boat with us?

4488
03:17:26.140 --> 03:17:26.973
MATT: He's still with you guys.

4489
03:17:26.973 --> 03:17:28.866
He's nervously watching and checking for

4490
03:17:28.866 --> 03:17:31.003
your responses and stuff.
LAURA: Oh my gosh, not-Essek,

4491
03:17:31.003 --> 03:17:32.950
are you going to stay on the road with us tonight?

4492
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:35.642
Because you can't go any closer, huh?

4493
03:17:35.642 --> 03:17:36.475
Are you going to sleep here?

4494
03:17:36.475 --> 03:17:38.370
Or are you going to sleep on our boat?

4495
03:17:38.370 --> 03:17:42.120
MATT: "I can probably handle myself, do not worry."

4496
03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:45.110
LAURA: Where are you going to sleep?

4497
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:48.620
MATT: "I can return to my tower."

4498
03:17:48.620 --> 03:17:52.060
LAURA: Oh, and then just come here tomorrow?

4499
03:17:52.060 --> 03:17:52.893
MATT: "Yes."

4500
03:17:54.946 --> 03:17:56.270
LAURA: That's pretty cool.
TALIESIN: That is pretty cool.

4501
03:17:56.270 --> 03:17:57.110
Technically speaking,

4502
03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:59.610
nobody's sleeping in the captain's quarters.

4503
03:18:00.670 --> 03:18:02.410
LAURA: Well, we have our Fjord decoy.

4504
03:18:02.410 --> 03:18:04.400
TALIESIN: That's fair, there's a dummy in there.

4505
03:18:06.030 --> 03:18:06.863
Oh, yeah.

4506
03:18:06.863 --> 03:18:08.160
No, never mind.
MATT: "Very strange, but okay."

4507
03:18:08.160 --> 03:18:08.993
LAURA: Essek.

4508
03:18:10.335 --> 03:18:11.680
(whispered) Should I tell him?

4509
03:18:11.680 --> 03:18:13.460
SAM: What?
LAURA: Never mind, go

4510
03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:14.821
to your tower.
TALIESIN: He doesn't know about that yet.

4511
03:18:14.821 --> 03:18:17.488
It's one problem at a time.

4512
03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:20.960
LIAM: We have a lot of irons in the fire.

4513
03:18:20.960 --> 03:18:22.468
MATT: "I can only imagine."

4514
03:18:23.950 --> 03:18:26.330
LAURA: Hey, when you come here tomorrow,

4515
03:18:26.330 --> 03:18:28.490
will you bring some, like, pastries

4516
03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:31.520
because you'll be-- you'll, like-- something good?

4517
03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:33.520
Will you bring us a present?

4518
03:18:33.520 --> 03:18:35.573
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
TRAVIS: ♪ Something good-- ♪

4519
03:18:35.573 --> 03:18:37.906
(chuckling)

4520
03:18:40.792 --> 03:18:41.625
LAURA: Aw!

4521
03:18:41.625 --> 03:18:43.979
(laughter)

4522
03:18:43.979 --> 03:18:45.925
ASHLEY: and LAURA: It looked so good.

4523
03:18:45.925 --> 03:18:48.748
LAURA: Eight, but you like me, Essek, come on.

4524
03:18:48.748 --> 03:18:51.436
(laughter)

4525
03:18:51.436 --> 03:18:52.435
TRAVIS: Just top it off.

4526
03:18:52.435 --> 03:18:57.435
MATT: "Things are a bit tense for me to head to a bakery.

4527
03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:00.290
"But should all things go well,

4528
03:19:00.290 --> 03:19:01.873
"maybe another time.

4529
03:19:03.220 --> 03:19:08.050
"Nonetheless, I will take my leave for the night.

4530
03:19:08.050 --> 03:19:11.485
"Thank you for not throwing me into the water."

4531
03:19:11.485 --> 03:19:14.160
LIAM: And you're keeping it together?

4532
03:19:14.160 --> 03:19:16.248
MATT: "As well as expected."
LIAM: Okay.

4533
03:19:16.248 --> 03:19:19.810
MARISHA: You're going to bamf in tomorrow?

4534
03:19:19.810 --> 03:19:22.110
MATT: "I feel safer being closer to the information,

4535
03:19:23.350 --> 03:19:25.183
"just not close enough."

4536
03:19:26.140 --> 03:19:27.807
MARISHA: Yeah, that tracks.

4537
03:19:29.650 --> 03:19:32.475
MATT: "Anyway." (imitating whooshing)

4538
03:19:32.475 --> 03:19:33.883
And he's gone.
SAM: Counterspell.

4539
03:19:33.883 --> 03:19:36.716
(laughter)

4540
03:19:39.436 --> 03:19:41.200
TRAVIS: This usually works.

4541
03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:43.207
MATT: That'd be really funny.

4542
03:19:43.207 --> 03:19:45.338
But he is gone.

4543
03:19:45.338 --> 03:19:48.304
MARISHA: Huh.
LIAM: (repeated spellcasting whooshing)

4544
03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:52.800
But, yeah, evening's rest comes to you guys,

4545
03:19:52.800 --> 03:19:53.890
if there's anything you want to discuss, you can,

4546
03:19:53.890 --> 03:19:55.767
otherwise we will continue on for next morning.

4547
03:19:55.767 --> 03:19:56.725
TALIESIN: Going to bed early.

4548
03:19:56.725 --> 03:19:57.558
MATT: Okay.

4549
03:19:57.558 --> 03:19:59.150
SAM: All the protections, all the protections.

4550
03:19:59.150 --> 03:20:00.884
MATT: You got it. All the same setup,

4551
03:20:00.884 --> 03:20:04.321
guardians and such.

4552
03:20:04.321 --> 03:20:05.618
TALIESIN: Crystal heads.

4553
03:20:05.618 --> 03:20:07.710
LIAM: Crystal heads.

4554
03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:09.912
This boat has got everything.

4555
03:20:09.912 --> 03:20:11.350
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Essek.

4556
03:20:11.350 --> 03:20:12.530
SAM: Jesus.

4557
03:20:12.530 --> 03:20:13.769
MATT: Okay.

4558
03:20:13.769 --> 03:20:14.935
LAURA: You have, like, assistants!

4559
03:20:14.935 --> 03:20:17.026
Like, send one of your guys out

4560
03:20:17.026 --> 03:20:19.550
and then just have them come back

4561
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:21.650
and then you can have it in the morning for us.

4562
03:20:21.650 --> 03:20:24.463
LIAM: Ask him if he has any paper.
LAURA: What a good breakfast that would be.

4563
03:20:24.463 --> 03:20:26.032
LAURA: Bup, bup.

4564
03:20:26.032 --> 03:20:26.932
(laughter)

4565
03:20:26.932 --> 03:20:28.515
MARISHA: Bless you.
SAM: Excuse me.

4566
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:33.030
MATT: "I'm trying to sleep, Jester.

4567
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:36.980
"There is no bakery open at the moment.

4568
03:20:36.980 --> 03:20:39.290
"My sincerest apologies."

4569
03:20:43.290 --> 03:20:46.280
LAURA: Being on the water is lame.

4570
03:20:46.280 --> 03:20:47.800
MATT: Not a lot of seaside bakeries out there

4571
03:20:47.800 --> 03:20:49.807
floating, sorry.

4572
03:20:50.790 --> 03:20:52.390
MARISHA: He's a war criminal, you know.

4573
03:20:53.650 --> 03:20:55.410
What are you going to do with him?

4574
03:20:55.410 --> 03:20:58.750
SAM: After we fix the war, then we'll punish him.

4575
03:20:58.750 --> 03:21:00.060
MARISHA: I don't trust him.

4576
03:21:00.060 --> 03:21:04.485
SAM: Of course not, that's why we'll punish him.

4577
03:21:04.485 --> 03:21:08.500
TALIESIN: He could bring baked goods, I agree.

4578
03:21:08.500 --> 03:21:10.540
LAURA: Maybe if he brings some baked goods,

4579
03:21:10.540 --> 03:21:13.260
then we will punish him less.

4580
03:21:13.260 --> 03:21:14.920
SAM: One year off his sentence.

4581
03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:16.333
LAURA: Sure, for every pastry.

4582
03:21:16.333 --> 03:21:17.776
LIAM: There's plenty of people

4583
03:21:17.776 --> 03:21:20.776
in your own nation to be furious at?

4584
03:21:22.210 --> 03:21:25.293
SAM: Sure, yeah, we should get them, too.

4585
03:21:26.291 --> 03:21:28.584
MARISHA: What are you talking about?

4586
03:21:28.584 --> 03:21:29.821
What are you saying?

4587
03:21:29.821 --> 03:21:32.150
LIAM: I'm saying she has a lot of vitriol for Essek

4588
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:33.160
and that is understandable.

4589
03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:36.200
But there is just as much fault in our own country.

4590
03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:37.033
SAM: Oh, yes, no,

4591
03:21:37.033 --> 03:21:37.940
I think the order should be

4592
03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:40.410
punishing everyone in the Empire first.

4593
03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:43.090
Because we're going to become a team of ninjas

4594
03:21:43.090 --> 03:21:44.560
that just does that for a while.

4595
03:21:44.560 --> 03:21:46.860
MARISHA: Yeah, and it's not a pissing contest of evil

4596
03:21:46.860 --> 03:21:48.850
or who's the bigger war criminal.

4597
03:21:48.850 --> 03:21:51.640
SAM: And then after all of
the Empire folks have been punished

4598
03:21:51.640 --> 03:21:53.910
and killed by us, team of ninjas.

4599
03:21:53.910 --> 03:21:54.960
Then we will

4600
03:21:56.240 --> 03:21:57.240
punish Essek

4601
03:21:58.510 --> 03:22:00.000
or at least see that he

4602
03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:00.950
gets some sort of--

4603
03:22:02.811 --> 03:22:03.980
I don't know know.

4604
03:22:03.980 --> 03:22:07.480
He has to, there has to be some sort of...

4605
03:22:10.830 --> 03:22:12.970
We can't just let it go.

4606
03:22:12.970 --> 03:22:14.189
MARISHA: Justice.

4607
03:22:14.189 --> 03:22:15.022
SAM: Yeah.

4608
03:22:17.250 --> 03:22:20.200
LIAM: Add him to the list.

4609
03:22:20.200 --> 03:22:21.720
SAM: He can be at the end.

4610
03:22:21.720 --> 03:22:22.820
TALIESIN: We'll be at the end.

4611
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:29.516
TRAVIS: I'm going down--

4612
03:22:31.316 --> 03:22:32.732
LAURA: (chuckles)

4613
03:22:33.920 --> 03:22:35.750
TRAVIS: -- <i>below decks.</i>

4614
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:37.087
SAM: Sure, sure.

4615
03:22:39.370 --> 03:22:41.140
LIAM: Actually, I'll leave the deck late.

4616
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:45.588
On my own.

4617
03:22:45.588 --> 03:22:47.693
LAURA: I'll go to sleep.
MARISHA: Sleep.

4618
03:22:47.693 --> 03:22:50.135
MATT: All right, everyone's going to sleep.

4619
03:22:53.900 --> 03:22:56.060
The night goes on quietly

4620
03:22:59.407 --> 03:23:01.324
and the morning comes

4621
03:23:01.324 --> 03:23:02.500
as dark as it left you.

4622
03:23:04.310 --> 03:23:08.660
As you all come to consciousness, have your morning meal as

4623
03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:11.419
flavorful as it possibly can be, with Caduceus as--

4624
03:23:11.419 --> 03:23:12.850
TALIESIN: I'm going to trying and bake.

4625
03:23:12.850 --> 03:23:15.093
I'm trying to bake.
SAM: Wake and bake.

4626
03:23:15.093 --> 03:23:16.230
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

4627
03:23:16.230 --> 03:23:17.063
Try and bake.

4628
03:23:17.063 --> 03:23:17.896
LIAM: Wake and bake.

4629
03:23:17.896 --> 03:23:19.460
TRAVIS: On the ship?
TALIESIN: Yep.

4630
03:23:19.460 --> 03:23:20.293
There's a mess,

4631
03:23:20.293 --> 03:23:21.630
I'm going to do my best.

4632
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:23.140
MATT: Okay, go ahead.

4633
03:23:24.513 --> 03:23:25.880
Go ahead and roll intelligence check for me.

4634
03:23:25.880 --> 03:23:28.034
TALIESIN: Oh, awesome.

4635
03:23:28.034 --> 03:23:29.240
LAURA: Oh no.

4636
03:23:29.240 --> 03:23:33.210
TALIESIN: That's the best because I'm so intelligent.

4637
03:23:33.210 --> 03:23:34.320
That's a 14.

4638
03:23:34.320 --> 03:23:35.970
LAURA: Oh, that's not bad.
LIAM: Pretty good.

4639
03:23:35.970 --> 03:23:36.803
MATT: Not bad.

4640
03:23:38.180 --> 03:23:41.230
With the sort of spell craft you have at your disposal

4641
03:23:41.230 --> 03:23:43.880
the materials that you've already brought along with you.

4642
03:23:43.880 --> 03:23:48.350
You manage to pull out some, they're technically baked.

4643
03:23:48.350 --> 03:23:49.330
What are you making?

4644
03:23:49.330 --> 03:23:51.060
MARISHA: "Technically baked?"
TALIESIN: Well,

4645
03:23:51.060 --> 03:23:53.730
I'm attempting to make, like, a cake.

4646
03:23:53.730 --> 03:23:55.350
But a healthy cake.

4647
03:23:55.350 --> 03:23:57.950
I mean, with what, you know,

4648
03:23:57.950 --> 03:23:59.890
we're not crazy people.
LAURA: Like a mushroom cake?

4649
03:23:59.890 --> 03:24:01.990
TALIESIN: It's not a mushroom cake,

4650
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:04.040
it's more of attempting a truffle cake,

4651
03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:06.940
but, you know, we'll see what comes together.

4652
03:24:06.940 --> 03:24:08.633
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Truffles are mushrooms.

4653
03:24:08.633 --> 03:24:09.607
TALIESIN: I know.

4654
03:24:09.607 --> 03:24:11.565
(laughter)

4655
03:24:11.565 --> 03:24:13.779
I don't know much to know that.

4656
03:24:13.779 --> 03:24:14.870
I don't think I have chocolate,

4657
03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:18.920
so I'm finding what I can and throwing something together

4658
03:24:18.920 --> 03:24:19.753
it's going to be okay.

4659
03:24:19.753 --> 03:24:22.730
MATT: This is the-- you succeed in creating

4660
03:24:22.730 --> 03:24:23.940
what you set out to create

4661
03:24:23.940 --> 03:24:25.030
and as you all come to,

4662
03:24:25.030 --> 03:24:28.370
you are met with the curious smell of something baked

4663
03:24:28.370 --> 03:24:31.170
on the sea by Caduceus.

4664
03:24:31.170 --> 03:24:33.775
For Caduceus and the rest of you.

4665
03:24:33.775 --> 03:24:35.608
MARISHA: I try it.
LAURA: Caduceus!

4666
03:24:37.002 --> 03:24:38.085
MARISHA: Is it good?

4667
03:24:39.011 --> 03:24:40.920
TALIESIN: It's adequate.

4668
03:24:40.920 --> 03:24:42.420
MARISHA: Yeah, do I feel poisoned?

4669
03:24:42.420 --> 03:24:43.740
Do I feel?

4670
03:24:43.740 --> 03:24:45.810
MATT: You do not, you are immune to poison.

4671
03:24:45.810 --> 03:24:48.020
MARISHA: Well, can I recognize?

4672
03:24:48.020 --> 03:24:48.853
MATT: It's not poisonous.

4673
03:24:48.853 --> 03:24:51.372
MARISHA: It's not poisoned.
TALIESIN: To you.

4674
03:24:51.372 --> 03:24:52.566
(laughter)

4675
03:24:52.566 --> 03:24:54.569
TALIESIN: Remember the last of that psychotropic fruit

4676
03:24:54.569 --> 03:24:56.226
that I've just been holding onto.

4677
03:24:56.226 --> 03:24:57.809
LAURA: No.

4678
03:24:57.809 --> 03:24:58.892
LIAM: Instant diarrhea.

4679
03:24:58.892 --> 03:25:00.333
TALIESIN: We're all going to find our best selves.

4680
03:25:00.333 --> 03:25:01.808
It's going to be great.

4681
03:25:02.793 --> 03:25:06.260
MATT: It's a bit dry, it's a bit crumbly.

4682
03:25:06.260 --> 03:25:09.220
It's sweet enough

4683
03:25:09.220 --> 03:25:12.990
that, compared to a lot of the rest of the high seas,

4684
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:15.180
flavorless food you've gotten used to,

4685
03:25:15.180 --> 03:25:17.300
it has something to it that is different

4686
03:25:17.300 --> 03:25:18.770
and unique and a little sweet.

4687
03:25:18.770 --> 03:25:20.290
LAURA: Perfect.

4688
03:25:20.290 --> 03:25:21.480
Thank you, Caduceus.

4689
03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:23.146
TALIESIN: No problem. I'll get better at this.

4690
03:25:23.146 --> 03:25:24.210
LAURA: No, you don't need to--
TALIESIN: I'm excited.

4691
03:25:24.210 --> 03:25:26.270
LAURA: This is the best thing I've ever tasted.

4692
03:25:26.270 --> 03:25:28.450
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm excited to learn. This is good.

4693
03:25:28.450 --> 03:25:30.246
ASHLEY: It's very tasty.

4694
03:25:30.246 --> 03:25:32.067
MATT: Requires a lot of water to drink with it, though.

4695
03:25:32.067 --> 03:25:34.317
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's real dry.

4696
03:25:36.414 --> 03:25:39.250
MATT: The negotiations begin once more.

4697
03:25:39.250 --> 03:25:42.070
The deck is filled with all the figures.

4698
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:45.680
The ships are once again populated

4699
03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:47.340
with a show of power

4700
03:25:47.340 --> 03:25:49.340
as the two sides continue conversations.

4701
03:25:51.130 --> 03:25:54.390
Another hour and a half continues.

4702
03:25:54.390 --> 03:25:57.240
Essek, in his illusory self, appears once more on the deck.

4703
03:25:59.450 --> 03:26:01.720
"I hope I had not missed anything."

4704
03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:02.553
SAM: Literally

4705
03:26:02.553 --> 03:26:04.140
nothing has happened.
MATT: "Wonderful, wonderful."

4706
03:26:04.140 --> 03:26:06.710
LAURA: They've just been talking.

4707
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:08.610
MATT: A moment passes as you're having this conversation

4708
03:26:08.610 --> 03:26:10.310
where you see there's a mild flash

4709
03:26:12.100 --> 03:26:14.020
at the location of this discussion.

4710
03:26:14.020 --> 03:26:15.400
SAM: Oh.

4711
03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:18.594
LAURA: Looking glass, looking glass.

4712
03:26:18.594 --> 03:26:19.840
MATT: You look over and you can see a lot of the ships

4713
03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:21.530
suddenly grow tense and people begin doing the same

4714
03:26:21.530 --> 03:26:22.986
everyone is looking over

4715
03:26:22.986 --> 03:26:24.790
and you see Ludinus opening a chest.

4716
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:26.290
MARISHA: Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

4717
03:26:26.290 --> 03:26:27.123
SAM: That's good.

4718
03:26:27.123 --> 03:26:27.956
MARISHA: This is it, this is it.

4719
03:26:27.956 --> 03:26:30.210
MATT: You see the beacon is removed from it.

4720
03:26:30.210 --> 03:26:31.060
MARISHA: Okay.

4721
03:26:31.060 --> 03:26:35.245
MATT: Ludinus hands it over to
Lord Zeddan Graf, who takes it.

4722
03:26:35.245 --> 03:26:36.803
TRAVIS: I'm so nervous right now.
MARISHA: I know, me too.

4723
03:26:36.803 --> 03:26:40.953
MATT: Steps forward and presents it to the Dusk Captain.

4724
03:26:41.900 --> 03:26:43.630
She steps forward

4725
03:26:43.630 --> 03:26:45.190
and takes it, there's a moment where they both

4726
03:26:45.190 --> 03:26:46.410
hold the handles together

4727
03:26:46.410 --> 03:26:51.050
looking directly into each other's eyes wordlessly.

4728
03:26:51.050 --> 03:26:54.870
Lord Graf's expression is smiles,

4729
03:26:54.870 --> 03:26:57.553
confident, charismatic.

4730
03:26:57.553 --> 03:27:02.553
The Dusk Captain is cold and reading.

4731
03:27:02.820 --> 03:27:04.737
Eventually, he lets go.

4732
03:27:06.050 --> 03:27:09.565
She takes two steps back and hands it to one of the other

4733
03:27:09.565 --> 03:27:11.920
Kryn at her side and they begin to do a thorough

4734
03:27:11.920 --> 03:27:13.530
investigation of it.

4735
03:27:13.530 --> 03:27:18.463
While she does not break eyes with the Lord Graf.

4736
03:27:19.494 --> 03:27:20.660
SAM: Why me?

4737
03:27:20.660 --> 03:27:22.795
MATT: Because you're right there and it's in front of you.

4738
03:27:22.795 --> 03:27:25.089
SAM: (fake sobbing)

4739
03:27:25.089 --> 03:27:27.380
MATT: Tense moments continue

4740
03:27:27.380 --> 03:27:31.270
until eventually, it seems they finish their investigation

4741
03:27:31.270 --> 03:27:32.650
and they begin walking the beacon

4742
03:27:32.650 --> 03:27:35.347
below the deck of the Everstorm.

4743
03:27:37.020 --> 03:27:38.210
More conversations continue

4744
03:27:38.210 --> 03:27:39.540
as they sit back down in their chairs

4745
03:27:39.540 --> 03:27:42.270
in the mirrors are having this conversation.

4746
03:27:43.220 --> 03:27:45.020
Then you watch as two figures

4747
03:27:45.020 --> 03:27:46.916
are brought to the decks in chains.

4748
03:27:46.916 --> 03:27:49.761
LAURA: Those are the prisoners.

4749
03:27:49.761 --> 03:27:53.673
MATT: You see one of them, a familiar visage

4750
03:27:53.673 --> 03:27:56.360
of the Taskhand Adeen Tasithar.

4751
03:27:56.360 --> 03:27:57.201
MARISHA: Adeen Mazel.

4752
03:27:57.201 --> 03:27:58.651
LIAM and MATT: Yeah.

4753
03:27:58.651 --> 03:28:00.362
TRAVIS: Adele Dazeem.

4754
03:28:00.362 --> 03:28:03.747
LIAM: (coughing) Get it right.

4755
03:28:03.747 --> 03:28:05.630
ASHLEY: Get the wrong name right.

4756
03:28:05.630 --> 03:28:09.730
MATT: And coming up on the Blue Heaven in chains as well.

4757
03:28:09.730 --> 03:28:12.063
Vence Nuthaleus.

4758
03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:16.750
Two figures are brought to the center

4759
03:28:19.300 --> 03:28:24.120
and they're both traded off, the chains given to the other

4760
03:28:24.120 --> 03:28:25.550
and they are then brought to the

4761
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:28.602
opposing ships and brought below deck.

4762
03:28:29.780 --> 03:28:32.150
LAURA: Essek, did you ever talk to him?

4763
03:28:32.150 --> 03:28:33.950
Did you hang out with him?

4764
03:28:33.950 --> 03:28:36.700
MATT: "We once knew each other for a while.

4765
03:28:36.700 --> 03:28:37.533
LAURA: Does he suck?

4766
03:28:38.640 --> 03:28:40.040
MATT: "That is a word, yes."

4767
03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:43.110
LAURA: Okay, he looks like he sucks.

4768
03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:46.460
MARISHA: How does it feel seeing him in chains and not you?

4769
03:28:46.460 --> 03:28:47.876
MATT: "Honestly?

4770
03:28:49.218 --> 03:28:50.559
"Freeing."

4771
03:28:57.110 --> 03:29:00.820
SAM: Looks like things are going well.

4772
03:29:00.820 --> 03:29:03.842
MATT: You hear a horn go off.

4773
03:29:03.842 --> 03:29:06.029
LAURA: (pathetic horn imitation)

4774
03:29:06.029 --> 03:29:08.270
MATT: (low horn imitation)

4775
03:29:08.270 --> 03:29:09.662
It's everything.

4776
03:29:09.662 --> 03:29:10.920
TRAVIS: Is it?

4777
03:29:10.920 --> 03:29:11.753
MATT: Sure.

4778
03:29:11.753 --> 03:29:12.753
TRAVIS: It's all about growth, right?

4779
03:29:12.753 --> 03:29:14.341
MATT: It's low guttural. Yeah.

4780
03:29:14.341 --> 03:29:15.538
I hate you all so much.

4781
03:29:15.538 --> 03:29:17.006
(laughter)

4782
03:29:17.006 --> 03:29:19.157
(various pathetic horn imitations)

4783
03:29:19.157 --> 03:29:22.226
(laughter)

4784
03:29:22.226 --> 03:29:25.466
LIAM: It'll pass, Matt.
Just give us two minutes, it'll pass.

4785
03:29:25.466 --> 03:29:26.560
(laughter)

4786
03:29:26.560 --> 03:29:28.741
MARISHA: Anyway, that was a good one, though.

4787
03:29:28.741 --> 03:29:32.273
TRAVIS: Guys, I don't want to fight a fucking sea dragon.

4788
03:29:33.398 --> 03:29:35.415
LAURA: No, no, no, no.

4789
03:29:37.008 --> 03:29:38.069
MATT: Okay.

4790
03:29:38.069 --> 03:29:40.600
(laughter)

4791
03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:41.433
So

4792
03:29:43.440 --> 03:29:45.023
as the horn blares,

4793
03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:51.397
everyone stands to attention at the edge of the boat decks.

4794
03:29:53.850 --> 03:29:57.030
And you watch as the initial flags that were placed

4795
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:59.970
at the beginning of this negotiation that signified

4796
03:29:59.970 --> 03:30:01.953
its start, come down

4797
03:30:03.670 --> 03:30:04.870
and are replaced

4798
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:07.183
with new flags.

4799
03:30:09.120 --> 03:30:10.613
These, you can see,

4800
03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:14.810
hold a deep blue color

4801
03:30:15.730 --> 03:30:19.330
and on a political nautical standpoint,

4802
03:30:19.330 --> 03:30:23.271
you're told by Orly, as he looks over and turns back,

4803
03:30:23.271 --> 03:30:24.980
"Mm.

4804
03:30:24.980 --> 03:30:27.230
"Seems it's all's gone well.

4805
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:31.040
"It came to a close."

4806
03:30:31.040 --> 03:30:33.000
You can see as skiffs beginning to

4807
03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:36.020
make their way away from the Blue Heaven.

4808
03:30:36.020 --> 03:30:39.710
And people on those ships are shouting up

4809
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:40.960
to decks as they pass by.

4810
03:30:40.960 --> 03:30:43.800
You can see the mirrors being

4811
03:30:43.800 --> 03:30:45.350
brought away and below deck

4812
03:30:45.350 --> 03:30:47.550
and that platform between the two ships

4813
03:30:47.550 --> 03:30:49.710
is being deconstructed.

4814
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:50.650
As the skiff comes close,

4815
03:30:50.650 --> 03:30:52.550
you could hear the voice shouting out.

4816
03:30:53.790 --> 03:30:56.358
"Negotiations have completed

4817
03:30:56.358 --> 03:31:00.010
"and King Dwendal has declared the war come to a close.

4818
03:31:00.010 --> 03:31:02.750
"All armada ships return to Nicodranas.

4819
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:04.590
"Guest vessels are free to disembark

4820
03:31:04.590 --> 03:31:06.198
"and travel as they please."

4821
03:31:07.920 --> 03:31:08.920
SAM: Thank you.

4822
03:31:09.999 --> 03:31:12.975
Do we tip? I don't think we tip.

4823
03:31:12.975 --> 03:31:14.568
TALIESIN: We wait.

4824
03:31:14.568 --> 03:31:16.580
LIAM: Waiting and watching still.

4825
03:31:16.580 --> 03:31:19.750
MATT: Time passes as the remnants of that platform

4826
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:22.992
are finally disassembled.

4827
03:31:24.390 --> 03:31:26.950
The anchors are pulled up.

4828
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:29.340
And you can see the two tense groups

4829
03:31:29.340 --> 03:31:32.340
on each deck just looking towards each other.

4830
03:31:33.840 --> 03:31:35.257
Give a tense nod.

4831
03:31:36.920 --> 03:31:40.170
The horns blast once more.

4832
03:31:40.170 --> 03:31:45.087
And the armadas begin to break and separate to their sides.

4833
03:31:46.310 --> 03:31:49.602
The sails begin to unfurl once more and pick up the wind.

4834
03:31:52.170 --> 03:31:54.910
And it seems the negotiations are over.

4835
03:31:54.910 --> 03:31:56.600
LAURA: That's it, huh?

4836
03:31:56.600 --> 03:31:57.860
War's over?

4837
03:31:57.860 --> 03:31:58.693
TALIESIN: No.

4838
03:31:59.780 --> 03:32:01.430
SAM: Figured there'd be some sort of

4839
03:32:02.480 --> 03:32:06.900
fireworks or something to signify, but I guess that's it.

4840
03:32:06.900 --> 03:32:08.494
LAURA: Hey, guys, we did it.

4841
03:32:08.494 --> 03:32:10.440
SAM: We won.

4842
03:32:10.440 --> 03:32:11.273
LAURA: Yeah.

4843
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.983
Good job.

4844
03:32:15.250 --> 03:32:17.666
TRAVIS: Doesn't really feel that way though, does it?

4845
03:32:17.666 --> 03:32:20.110
LIAM: Really expected--

4846
03:32:20.110 --> 03:32:21.690
LAURA: Them to fight?

4847
03:32:21.690 --> 03:32:22.523
LIAM: Yeah.

4848
03:32:23.710 --> 03:32:27.099
TRAVIS: Something to go wrong
at the last minute, with our luck.

4849
03:32:27.099 --> 03:32:28.099
TALIESIN: Well.
LIAM: Yeah.

4850
03:32:30.020 --> 03:32:33.500
TALIESIN: Sometimes, no matter how hard everybody tries,

4851
03:32:35.270 --> 03:32:37.020
everything quiets down for a while.

4852
03:32:38.140 --> 03:32:39.340
MATT: (as Essek "Outwardly, at least."

4853
03:32:42.240 --> 03:32:45.700
TALIESIN: For a moment people won't get hurt.

4854
03:32:45.700 --> 03:32:47.910
LAURA: Do you think it'll really end?

4855
03:32:47.910 --> 03:32:51.447
TALIESIN: Nothing like this ends, it just calms down.

4856
03:32:52.470 --> 03:32:54.053
MATT: "I think this will

4857
03:32:55.810 --> 03:33:00.049

03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:27.640
MATT: "Well, I have to

4866
03:33:29.330 --> 03:33:31.210
"take care of a few loose ends

MARISHA: What are their names?

Insight check.

03:34:32.412 --> 03:34:34.937
Oh shit.
MARISHA: Pooper muffin.

4893
03:34:34.937 --> 03:34:36.560
18.

03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:37.670
MATT: 18?

4895
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:40.281
SAM: Oh! 18, whisper. It's, like, a half whisper.

Remember to cover your mouth if you sneeze.

TALIESIN: I've been so bad about that.

4904
03:34:57.970 --> 03:34:58.803

SAM: No fun.

4908
03:35:07.159 --> 03:35:09.550
If you have a wife or a loved one or a husband,

4909
03:35:09.550 --> 03:35:12.247
or don't kiss them or touch them in any way.

LIAM: Cut them out of your life.

thread or two yourself, Essek.

LAURA: Well, just <i>a</i> week.

4938
03:36:32.791 --> 03:36:34.290

LAURA: I've had them for, like, a week.

4940
03:36:36.438 --> 03:36:38.790
TRAVIS: Do they put preservatives in your cupcakes?

4941
03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:40.490
SAM: If you heat them up a little, they still taste good.

4942
03:36:40.490 --> 03:36:41.340
LAURA: Do they look good?

4943
03:36:41.340 --> 03:36:43.242
Do they look like they're not moldy yet?

4944
03:36:44.390 --> 03:36:46.261
TRAVIS: Week old, non preservative.
LAURA: They're a week old.

4945
03:36:46.261 --> 03:36:48.444
That's a week old in a bag of holding,

4946
03:36:48.444 --> 03:36:50.127
in a haversack.
TRAVIS: It's a fantasy world,

rules still apply.

4950
03:36:56.360 --> 03:36:58.810

4951
03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:01.567
white dust on the edges.

4957
03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:12.600
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to cut just around the dust and try--

4958
03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:16.510
MATT: Okay, it's very dry, very stale,
but functionally edible.

4959
03:37:16.510 --> 03:37:20.110
TALIESIN: I cast Decompose on the trunk with a dust.

4960
03:37:20.110 --> 03:37:22.831

4965
03:37:28.180 --> 03:37:30.305

LAURA: Wow.

4969
03:37:33.823 --> 03:37:36.790
That was, like, I didn't expect it to really happen.

4970
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:37.623
What do we do now?

4971
03:37:37.623 --> 03:37:38.456
like do we just go and--

4972
03:37:38.456 --> 03:37:41.215
SAM: Go to volcano and party until

4973
03:37:41.215 --> 03:37:42.720
we drink our faces off.

TRAVIS: Assign the landing area, prep.

4978
03:37:52.007 --> 03:37:55.010
TALIESIN: I mean, can we even see any of the ships any more?

4979
03:37:55.010 --> 03:37:57.840
LAURA: Yeah, they all left.

4980
03:37:57.840 --> 03:37:59.345
Yeah, they all sailing away are they,

4981
03:37:59.345 --> 03:38:03.643
are they gone out over the horizon or?

4982
03:38:03.643 --> 03:38:04.893
LIAM: What is the occasion?

4983
03:38:04.893 --> 03:38:05.726
MATT: They're leaving.

4984
03:38:05.726 --> 03:38:06.565
SAM: Okay.

4985
03:38:06.565 --> 03:38:10.410
MARISHA: I mean, I think we ended war amongst our people.

4986
03:38:10.410 --> 03:38:12.330
Maybe for time being.

4987
03:38:12.330 --> 03:38:13.163
LIAM: Maybe.

4988
03:38:14.270 --> 03:38:16.020
MARISHA: Do I need an occasion to hug you?

4989
03:38:16.938 --> 03:38:17.771
LIAM: No.

4990
03:38:19.290 --> 03:38:20.123
No.

4991
03:38:22.080 --> 03:38:23.860
LAURA: Oh you're going in again, do it again.

4992
03:38:23.860 --> 03:38:26.950
MARISHA: Yeah, well, with this one
I want him to, like, reciprocate, though.

4993
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:28.593
SAM: He's not a reciprocating hugger.

4994
03:38:28.593 --> 03:38:29.940
LAURA: Look at them he's doing, he's going to do it.

4995
03:38:29.940 --> 03:38:30.853
He's going to do it.

4996
03:38:30.853 --> 03:38:31.824
SAM: Ooh, it's awkward.

4997
03:38:31.824 --> 03:38:33.910
LAURA: Put that arm around her,

4998
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:35.759
give her a big hug.
TRAVIS: It's a Voldemort hug.

4999
03:38:35.759 --> 03:38:37.336
SAM: (howling)

5000
03:38:37.336 --> 03:38:39.512
It's sort of okay.

5001
03:38:39.512 --> 03:38:41.385
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: It's like when he dances.

5002
03:38:41.385 --> 03:38:43.386
LAURA: He doesn't look like he's frowning quite as much.

5003
03:38:43.386 --> 03:38:45.710
LIAM: I just hope it sticks.

5004
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:46.950
MARISHA: Yeah, me tot.

5005
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:48.650
LAURA: All the coronavirus that you just spread

5006
03:38:48.650 --> 03:38:49.700
between the two of you.

5007
03:38:49.700 --> 03:38:51.770
LIAM: We've been doing that for a week and a half.

5008
03:38:51.770 --> 03:38:54.190
ALL: Ugh!

5009
03:38:54.190 --> 03:38:56.125
SAM: Purell your faces!

5010
03:38:56.125 --> 03:38:59.210
MATT: I can hear the stubble grinding the flesh off of you.

5011
03:38:59.210 --> 03:39:02.660
MARISHA: My grandpa used to do that to me as a joke.

5012
03:39:02.660 --> 03:39:04.409
LIAM: Burn the Marisha off of me.

5013
03:39:04.409 --> 03:39:06.950
(laughter)

5014
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:11.270
MATT: Careful, fire top and (whooshing).

5015
03:39:11.270 --> 03:39:12.103
All righty.

5016
03:39:13.210 --> 03:39:16.920
SAM: Tusktooth, are we setting sail for the volcano?

5017
03:39:16.920 --> 03:39:17.753
TRAVIS: I believe so.

5018
03:39:17.753 --> 03:39:19.010
I mean, time is on our side.

5019
03:39:19.010 --> 03:39:20.930
We don't know what the weather will be,

5020
03:39:20.930 --> 03:39:22.063
Master Gunner,

5021
03:39:22.063 --> 03:39:26.954
I believe ♪ if we want to enjoy this voyage. ♪

5022
03:39:28.271 --> 03:39:30.005
LIAM: ♪ Agony! ♪

5023
03:39:30.005 --> 03:39:31.954
TRAVIS: I think north of the Inkclaw Reef

5024
03:39:31.954 --> 03:39:35.090
is probably the fastest way.

5025
03:39:35.090 --> 03:39:36.850
LAURA: Is it more dangerous to go that way or something?

5026
03:39:36.850 --> 03:39:38.150
TRAVIS: Orly, is there any advantage

5027
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:42.826
to go into the south side of the Urukayxl area?

5028
03:39:42.826 --> 03:39:45.284
MATT: "Hmm.

5029
03:39:45.284 --> 03:39:50.076
"As far as I understand, the only real benefit

5030
03:39:50.076 --> 03:39:53.192
"is avoiding

5031
03:39:53.192 --> 03:39:56.392
"main sailing lanes.

5032
03:39:56.392 --> 03:39:59.900
"M-m-maybe

5033
03:39:59.900 --> 03:40:04.900
"try to not stick so close to dangerous

5034
03:40:05.008 --> 03:40:06.990
"coastal denizens.

5035
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:10.540
"But we are armed."

5036
03:40:10.540 --> 03:40:13.440
TRAVIS: That's true,
and we do need a little bit of excitement

5037
03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:16.260
after that political soiree.

5038
03:40:16.260 --> 03:40:19.890
Take us south of Urukayxl and of the Inkclaw Reef.

5039
03:40:19.890 --> 03:40:22.570
Let's make our way towards Rumblecusp.

5040
03:40:22.570 --> 03:40:25.210
MARISHA: (yelling) Make our way towards Rumblecusp.

5041
03:40:25.210 --> 03:40:27.174
TALIESIN: Wow, wow right in my ears.

5042
03:40:27.174 --> 03:40:28.698
MARISHA: The captain has declared--
MATT: "Aye, aye, Captain."

5043
03:40:28.698 --> 03:40:31.185
MARISHA: We are going to south of--

5044
03:40:31.185 --> 03:40:32.018
TALIESIN: Wow.

5045
03:40:32.018 --> 03:40:33.795
SAM: Rumblecusp.

5046
03:40:33.795 --> 03:40:36.263
MARISHA: Hoist the anchors!

5047
03:40:36.263 --> 03:40:38.167
MATT: "Aye aye."

5048
03:40:38.167 --> 03:40:39.561
MARISHA: Drop the sails!

5049
03:40:39.561 --> 03:40:41.917
Captain Tusktooth has declared.

5050
03:40:41.917 --> 03:40:43.581
(laughter)

5051
03:40:43.581 --> 03:40:46.028
MATT: You see Marius LePual goes.

5052
03:40:46.028 --> 03:40:48.100
MARISHA: Fuck you, Marius.

5053
03:40:48.100 --> 03:40:49.678
MATT: "What, hmm?"

5054
03:40:49.678 --> 03:40:52.775
Pulling up the anchor.
LIAM: Ocelot, Big Dipper!

5055
03:40:52.775 --> 03:40:54.200
MATT: The sails pick up the wind

5056
03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:57.650
and you begin heading southward from the meeting location.

5057
03:40:57.650 --> 03:41:00.470
You watch as the midnight

5058
03:41:00.470 --> 03:41:04.526
begins to subside as it travels with the armada.

5059
03:41:04.526 --> 03:41:07.460
And the bright noonday sun blares down upon you.

5060
03:41:07.460 --> 03:41:10.700
It takes moment to adjust, but the warmth is welcome.

5061
03:41:10.700 --> 03:41:12.860
LAURA: Why wouldn't they just, you know,

5062
03:41:12.860 --> 03:41:14.850
I mean, do you think they just teleported

5063
03:41:14.850 --> 03:41:17.900
away with the beacon, went straight back home,

5064
03:41:17.900 --> 03:41:19.240
they wouldn't take it on the ship, right?

5065
03:41:19.240 --> 03:41:20.330
SAM: No, I don't think so.

5066
03:41:20.330 --> 03:41:21.163
LAURA: That'd be dumb.

5067
03:41:21.163 --> 03:41:23.055
LIAM: They would be risking it at sea.

5068
03:41:24.730 --> 03:41:29.253
MATT: As the armada, between the joined interests of the

5069
03:41:29.253 --> 03:41:31.530
Dwendalian Empire and the Menagerie Coast

5070
03:41:31.530 --> 03:41:33.140
make their way westward.

5071
03:41:33.140 --> 03:41:34.650
You break away from both factions

5072
03:41:34.650 --> 03:41:37.670
as you see them vanish on the horizon,

5073
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:42.345
along with the southern tip of the continent of Wildemount.

5074
03:41:42.345 --> 03:41:44.500
You can just barely see westward,

5075
03:41:44.500 --> 03:41:46.378
elements of the island of Urukayxl

5076
03:41:46.378 --> 03:41:49.020
is this distant little bump.

5077
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:52.550
And you continue southward

5078
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:53.550
for the day,

5079
03:41:54.800 --> 03:41:55.650
for a second day.

5080
03:41:57.860 --> 03:42:00.640
For a third day, making your way around

5081
03:42:00.640 --> 03:42:03.300
the southern edge of the Inkclaw Reef,

5082
03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:06.770
making sure, carefully, with the aid of Orly,

5083
03:42:06.770 --> 03:42:10.570
and the map that you have there to avoid any of the

5084
03:42:10.570 --> 03:42:12.930
dangerous elements of the reef's tops

5085
03:42:12.930 --> 03:42:14.380
and you can see there are areas

5086
03:42:14.380 --> 03:42:15.730
where it breaks the surface

5087
03:42:15.730 --> 03:42:17.120
and you use those to guide yourself

5088
03:42:17.120 --> 03:42:18.380
and not get too close to what would be

5089
03:42:18.380 --> 03:42:22.515
a very damaging experience across the razor-like reef.

5090
03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:26.480
It's about the fourth day or so

5091
03:42:27.610 --> 03:42:31.200
that-- who's keeping a watch on this one?

5092
03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:32.590
TALIESIN: I usually do.

5093
03:42:32.590 --> 03:42:34.850
MATT: Okay, make perception check for me.

5094
03:42:34.850 --> 03:42:35.850
TALIESIN: All right.

5095
03:42:37.610 --> 03:42:40.050
TRAVIS: Yeah,
TALIESIN: 21.

5096
03:42:40.050 --> 03:42:41.800
MATT: 21, okay.

5097
03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:44.793
It's a,

5098
03:42:44.793 --> 03:42:47.043
(laughter)

5099
03:42:49.470 --> 03:42:50.940
the fourth day or so--
TALIESIN: I'll remember that.

5100
03:42:50.940 --> 03:42:53.000
MATT: -- ff traveling here
as you're crossing around the reef

5101
03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.430
and starting to head upward in a northern swing

5102
03:42:55.430 --> 03:42:57.013
towards Rumblecusp.

5103
03:42:57.880 --> 03:42:59.950
That you, keeping a watch

5104
03:42:59.950 --> 03:43:01.440
towards where the back of the ship is.

5105
03:43:01.440 --> 03:43:03.940
You can see there's a small, like,

5106
03:43:03.940 --> 03:43:05.802
looks like a

5107
03:43:05.802 --> 03:43:07.620
piece of land that's

5108
03:43:07.620 --> 03:43:09.560
breaching the surface of the water.

5109
03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:13.190
Like a small part of the reef behind,

5110
03:43:13.190 --> 03:43:15.340
but it's keeping pace.

5111
03:43:15.340 --> 03:43:17.435
MARISHA: Oh, son of a bitch.

5112
03:43:17.435 --> 03:43:21.420
TALIESIN: Captain, we're being followed by a tiny island.

5113
03:43:21.420 --> 03:43:22.953
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. Could you say that again?

5114
03:43:22.953 --> 03:43:25.027
TALIESIN: Said we're being followed by a tiny island.

5115
03:43:26.170 --> 03:43:27.650
MARISHA: Would I have any recollection--

5116
03:43:27.650 --> 03:43:29.480
LAURA: I go back and look at it.

5117
03:43:29.480 --> 03:43:30.860
MATT: Okay, you can see it now

5118
03:43:30.860 --> 03:43:32.500
that Caduceus points it out.

5119
03:43:32.500 --> 03:43:33.840
TALIESIN: Tiny island.

5120
03:43:33.840 --> 03:43:34.673
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's moving.

5121
03:43:34.673 --> 03:43:37.350
MARISHA: I've heard stories about moving tiny islands.

5122
03:43:37.350 --> 03:43:38.560
TRAVIS: How--
MATT: Make.

5123
03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:41.170
TRAVIS: -- far away?

5124
03:43:41.170 --> 03:43:42.540
LIAM: Make a tiny island check.

5125
03:43:42.540 --> 03:43:43.910
MATT: Yes, exactly.

5126
03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:45.260
You're proficient in that, right?

5127
03:43:45.260 --> 03:43:46.350
I would say go ahead and

5128
03:43:46.350 --> 03:43:50.447
make a history check with disadvantage.

5129
03:43:50.447 --> 03:43:51.463
MARISHA: With disadvantage.

5130
03:43:51.463 --> 03:43:53.230
MATT: Fjord, you can make a history check.

5131
03:43:53.230 --> 03:43:54.063
TRAVIS: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay.

5132
03:43:54.063 --> 03:43:56.340
Two 20's.
LAURA: What the heck.

5133
03:43:56.340 --> 03:43:59.698
MARISHA: Five year anniversary luck.

5134
03:43:59.698 --> 03:44:01.364
LIAM and MARISHA: One is cocked.
LIAM: One's really good, though.

5135
03:44:01.364 --> 03:44:02.722
MARISHA: One's really good. Shit.

5136
03:44:02.722 --> 03:44:04.500
LIAM: It was the two and then you roll a two again.

5137
03:44:04.500 --> 03:44:05.540
MARISHA: Two and a 19.

5138
03:44:05.540 --> 03:44:06.373
TRAVIS: 19.

5139
03:44:07.472 --> 03:44:08.305
MATT: Both got 19.

5140
03:44:08.305 --> 03:44:10.305
MARISHA: Okay, well, mine was a disadvantage.

5141
03:44:10.305 --> 03:44:12.470
So 10 total for me.

5142
03:44:12.470 --> 03:44:13.860
MATT: Okay.

5143
03:44:13.860 --> 03:44:16.410
Nothing comes to mind and you both watch this,

5144
03:44:16.410 --> 03:44:20.570
tiny island is gaining and the water around it is starting

5145
03:44:20.570 --> 03:44:24.259
to rise as it cuts a swath through the waters.

5146
03:44:24.259 --> 03:44:26.380
As you look over when you're called to the edge

5147
03:44:26.380 --> 03:44:28.020
and you glance over and you can see it

5148
03:44:28.020 --> 03:44:32.780
and if you've heard, you've heard tales of certain entities

5149
03:44:32.780 --> 03:44:37.380
of various types that are spoken of in mythology

5150
03:44:37.380 --> 03:44:39.750
of people that traverse the waters

5151
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:41.881
of the Lucidian Ocean and seas beyond.

5152
03:44:41.881 --> 03:44:42.714
TRAVIS: Don't.

5153
03:44:45.540 --> 03:44:48.270
MATT: This looks, indeed, like an island.

5154
03:44:48.270 --> 03:44:51.860
But just below the surface, you can see limbs

5155
03:44:51.860 --> 03:44:53.900
pushing through the waves.

5156
03:44:53.900 --> 03:44:56.040
As it continues to grow closer and closer

5157
03:44:56.040 --> 03:45:00.110
and you meet these thoughts, these myths, these tales

5158
03:45:00.110 --> 03:45:03.096
that you've heard across the Lucidian Ocean,

5159
03:45:03.096 --> 03:45:04.470
and the Swavain Islands.

5160
03:45:04.470 --> 03:45:09.370
You see the snout rise, pointed, the nostrils flare.

5161
03:45:11.610 --> 03:45:13.427
As you realize

5162
03:45:13.427 --> 03:45:15.316
you are being chased

5163
03:45:15.316 --> 03:45:16.469
by a dragon turtle.

5164
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:18.975
TRAVIS: (yelling) No, no!

5165
03:45:18.975 --> 03:45:20.200
Have you seen what a--

5166
03:45:20.200 --> 03:45:21.574
MATT: And that's where we're going to finish the episode.

5167
03:45:21.574 --> 03:45:23.057
(screaming)

5168
03:45:23.057 --> 03:45:26.210
TRAVIS: I just told somebody in Chicago that it's

5169
03:45:26.210 --> 03:45:30.001
the monster I want to see and not see at all.

5170
03:45:30.001 --> 03:45:31.121
Oh no!

5171
03:45:31.121 --> 03:45:33.299
TALIESIN: This is going to go great.

5172
03:45:33.299 --> 03:45:34.927
ASHLEY: A dragon turtle?

5173
03:45:34.927 --> 03:45:36.110
SAM: What does that mean?
TRAVIS: Have you seen

5174
03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:37.699
a picture of a dragon turtle?

5175
03:45:37.699 --> 03:45:38.673
MATT: I'll show you.

5176
03:45:38.673 --> 03:45:42.302
MARISHA: It's, like, a giant dragon turtle.

5177
03:45:42.302 --> 03:45:43.510
LIAM: It's what it sounds like.

5178
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:45.367
SAM: Is it a dragon or is it a turtle?

5179
03:45:45.367 --> 03:45:46.948
LAURA, TALIESIN, LIAM, MARISHA: Yes.

5180
03:45:46.948 --> 03:45:49.730
TRAVIS: It is awful, we are fucked.

5181
03:45:49.730 --> 03:45:51.938
LIAM: It's big, they're big.

5182
03:45:51.938 --> 03:45:54.291
MATT: You guys are fine.
MARISHA: It can house people.

5183
03:45:54.291 --> 03:45:55.572
SAM: Inside of it?

5184
03:45:55.572 --> 03:45:57.014
MARISHA: On it.

5185
03:45:57.014 --> 03:45:58.251
SAM: Oh, it's like an island?

5186
03:45:58.251 --> 03:45:59.312
TALIESIN: It's an island.

5187
03:45:59.312 --> 03:46:01.968
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah if the island is the tip of the iceberg.

5188
03:46:01.968 --> 03:46:03.244
LIAM: Yep. There it is.

5189
03:46:03.244 --> 03:46:05.885
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ooh!

5190
03:46:05.885 --> 03:46:08.440
MATT: That's a fun one.

5191
03:46:08.440 --> 03:46:11.500
TRAVIS: I love you on the five year anniversary.

5192
03:46:11.500 --> 03:46:13.544
I feel like this was a gift.

5193
03:46:13.544 --> 03:46:14.377
MATT: (chuckling)

5194
03:46:14.377 --> 03:46:15.770
You say that now, wait till next week.

5195
03:46:15.770 --> 03:46:18.950
LAURA: If we would have not fucked around so much.

5196
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:22.023
We would have fought that today, potentially?

5197
03:46:22.023 --> 03:46:22.910
SAM: No, we didn't fuck around.

5198
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:24.260
MATT: You didn't fuck around at all.

5199
03:46:24.260 --> 03:46:25.093
SAM: We just watch.

5200
03:46:25.093 --> 03:46:25.926
MATT: This was a--
LAURA: I tried to scry

5201
03:46:25.926 --> 03:46:28.717
on my Traveler.
TRAVIS: If we went north of Urukayxl--

5202
03:46:28.717 --> 03:46:30.850
MATT: You wouldn't have come across this.

5203
03:46:30.850 --> 03:46:32.807
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah, that was a perfectly reasonable--

5204
03:46:32.807 --> 03:46:33.808
TRAVIS: No regerts.

5205
03:46:33.808 --> 03:46:34.641
MATT: No regerts.

5206
03:46:34.641 --> 03:46:36.250
ALL: No regerts.

5207
03:46:36.250 --> 03:46:38.886
MATT: We'll pick up from there next week.

5208
03:46:38.886 --> 03:46:41.790
(cheering)
(clapping)

5209
03:46:41.790 --> 03:46:44.572
But from there, happy five year anniversary.

5210
03:46:44.572 --> 03:46:47.795
(cheering)

5211
03:46:47.795 --> 03:46:50.405
LIAM: We love you all.
TRAVIS: My legs can't stop moving.

5212
03:46:50.405 --> 03:46:52.469
MARISHA: Empire kids!

5213
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:54.125
LIAM: Yeah!

5214
03:46:54.125 --> 03:46:55.438
Freeze frame.

5215
03:46:55.438 --> 03:46:57.610
MATT: Tenuous peace has been found and nobody fucked it up

5216
03:46:57.610 --> 03:46:59.589
and I'm really proud of you guys.

5217
03:46:59.589 --> 03:47:01.580
LAURA: Look at that.
SAM: We're the best.

5218
03:47:01.580 --> 03:47:03.791
MATT: You've set some right pieces in motion--

5219
03:47:03.791 --> 03:47:06.253
LIAM: I was waiting for boats to go like this.

5220
03:47:06.253 --> 03:47:07.414
Mushroom cloud.

5221
03:47:07.414 --> 03:47:08.345
MARISHA: Oh, 100%.

5222
03:47:08.345 --> 03:47:11.323
MATT: Of course. Of course. Of course.

5223
03:47:11.323 --> 03:47:13.240
TRAVIS: Both sides would be like. (groaning)

5224
03:47:13.240 --> 03:47:14.630
MATT: And based on a lot of decisions

5225
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:16.030
and things that had happened in the past

5226
03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:17.720
everything was coming to this moment

5227
03:47:17.720 --> 03:47:20.616
and it seemed to go okay.

5228
03:47:20.616 --> 03:47:22.050
LAURA: Wow.

5229
03:47:22.050 --> 03:47:22.883
MARISHA: Wow.

5230
03:47:22.883 --> 03:47:25.640
SAM: We are the best at D&amp;D.

5231
03:47:25.640 --> 03:47:27.240
LAURA: Go team!

5232
03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:31.870
MATT: So with that, we'll see you guys next week.

5233
03:47:31.870 --> 03:47:32.790
Thank you for coming with us

5234
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:35.480
for these crazy five years, super excited

5235
03:47:35.480 --> 03:47:39.130
to see where it goes from here.

5236
03:47:39.130 --> 03:47:42.310
Take care of yourselves, take care of each other, be safe.

5237
03:47:42.310 --> 03:47:45.790
Do your research, wash your hands, all this stuff you know.

5238
03:47:45.790 --> 03:47:47.540
ASHLEY: Wash your hands immediately.

5239
03:47:47.540 --> 03:47:49.631
MATT: We're going to get through this together, guys.

5240
03:47:49.631 --> 03:47:51.590
SAM: Wash your stubbly face.

5241
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:52.800
TRAVIS: Gross.

5242
03:47:52.800 --> 03:47:54.596
MATT: We love you very much and

5243
03:47:54.596 --> 03:47:56.340
is it Thursday yet?

5244
03:47:56.340 --> 03:47:57.307
Good night, guys.

5245
03:47:57.307 --> 03:47:58.265
(cheering)
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

5246
03:47:58.265 --> 03:48:01.015
(dramatic orchestral music)

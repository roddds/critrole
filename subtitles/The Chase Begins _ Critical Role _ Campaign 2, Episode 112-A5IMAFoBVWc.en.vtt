00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.230
MATT: Hello and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.490
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.175
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.460
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.745
MATT: That one.

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:11.269
It's been a few weeks. Happy to be back.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.530
Happy to see you guys.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.340
And before we hop into tonight's episode,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.110
we have a hefty chunk of announcements to get to

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.010
because of that little delay.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.160
Beginning with the first of three sponsors tonight:

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.280
Ravensburger. Sam.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.520
SAM: (lisping) Yeah, hello.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.875
This episode is sponsored by Ravensburger

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:30.083
and The Princess Bride Adventure game.

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:31.920
Worked together to control characters

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.201
and complete each chapter's challenges.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.660
Game includes-- it's me, Vizzini.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.910
Game includes seven paintable miniatures,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.100
of Buttercup, Westley,
Inigo Montoya, Fezzik and more!

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.770
Flip through game boards as you retell the epic tale

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.137
of The Princess Bride.

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:48.820
Available now at Target

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.540
and at bit.ly/CRPrincessBride.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.820
To celebrate, I would like to invite

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.505
my best friend in the world, Liam O'Brien,

00:00:57.505 --> 00:00:59.670
to share a toast with me.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.503
A toast.

00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:02.090
LIAM: No, no, no, why am I dressed like this?

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.238
Wait, Princess Bride, goblet of wine--

00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:05.480
are you trying to poison me?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.480
SAM: Why don't you sniff your glass and tell me?

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:12.044
LIAM: The best impressions are the ones

00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:14.732
where you have to say the name of
the character that you're doing.

00:01:14.732 --> 00:01:16.890
(laughter)

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.598
LIAM: I do not smell anything.

00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:19.473
SAM: Aha!

00:01:19.473 --> 00:01:20.640
What you do not smell

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600
is the residue from my gigantic flask.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.040
It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.650
and is among the most deadly poisons known to man.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.133
LIAM: The disgusting foul flask that you never wash?

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:32.966
SAM: Correct!

00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.110
One of our goblets is from a fresh bottle of wine.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.060
The other was poured directly from my cursed flask,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.430
but which is which?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.623
The battle of wits has begun.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.780
LIAM: I mean, you pour the poison on mine, right?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.483
SAM: Did I? Am I the sort of man who would pour poison

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:51.720
into his own goblet or his enemy?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.010
A clever man would put the poison in his own goblet

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.550
because he knows that only a great fool

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.900
would reach for what's given, but you are not a great fool.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.670
So clearly you should not choose the one in front of you.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.260
LIAM: Yeah, but we can't switch glasses.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.022
Got the whole social distancing thing.

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:07.760
SAM: Which a man like me would have taken into account!

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.310
So clearly you cannot trust the goblet in front of you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.210
because I know you won't trust the goblet,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.000
then clearly I can not trust the goblet in front of me.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.350
LIAM: This...

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.275
This bit is dumb.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.005
SAM: It gets dumber!

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.000
If the flask wine is in front of me

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.730
and we aren't allowed to trade places,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.690
then Ravensburger would be sponsoring me

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.590
to drink my own disgusting, sewage-flavored flask juice,

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.030
and Ravensburger doesn't want to sponsor that.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.182
No one does.

00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:35.980
LIAM: All right, you're just stalling now, okay?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.441
Mine is definitely the nasty one, obviously.

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:40.920
SAM: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.670
But your confidence doesn't convince me,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.900
then clearly the poison is in my goblet!

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.291
LIAM: You... don't you...

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:50.307
You don't remember which one you poured it in, do you?

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:52.590
SAM: That is conceivable!

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.430
LIAM: All right, fuck it.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.363
I'm just going to drink so we can play D&amp;D.

00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:57.840
SAM: You fool!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.340
You fell victim to the classic blunders.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.849
Never go against a man who never washes his flask.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.545
(unhinged cackling)

00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:09.907
(heavy thud)

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:11.370
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh shit.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100
That sounded pretty solid.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.166
LIAM: Well.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:16.710
LAURA: Are you okay?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.223
LIAM: It wasn't his best bit, but at least it was his last.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.660
Don't forget to enter for your chance to win a copy

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.500
of the game by heading over to @RavensburgerNA on Twitter,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.060
where they're giving away free copies of the game right now.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.524
Back to you, Matt, and we're so sorry.

00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:36.530
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: Thank you, Liam and...Sam?

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.090
TRAVIS: Dude, his table must be so wet from all that spit.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.710
MATT: Yeah, right?
LAURA: Oh god.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.593
MATT: And thank you, Ravensburger, for whatever that was.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.347
Our second sponsor tonight is ThinkFun.

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:51.930
ThinkFun has their spooky new game

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.740
called Escape from the Room: The Cursed Dollhouse.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.750
It is the most immersive escape room

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.990
game experience ever,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.560
and ThinkFun's most challenging one to date.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.360
In the game, players explore a mysterious

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.690
three-dimensional dollhouse solving puzzles

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.790
in search of a way to escape from it.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.312
Five rooms, each containing objects to investigate

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.853
and multiple puzzles to solve,

00:04:10.853 --> 00:04:14.040
will keep even the most skilled escape room players engaged

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.730
through two hours of game play.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.880
You can even use the game box itself

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.150
to build a three-story dollhouse,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.790
complete with 3D furniture, to escape.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.873
(laughs triumphantly)

00:04:21.873 --> 00:04:22.750
So there!

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.785
Go check out the game now for yourself at Bit.ly,

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:30.640
bit.ly/CRescapetheroom.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.340
TRAVIS: That sounds terrifying. Why would anyone do that?

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.922
SAM: Matt, you're supposed to thank the sponsor at the end.

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:37.660
MATT: Oh right, sorry.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.920
SAM: But you can use the new sponsorship doll

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.223
to do that for you.

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:47.433
TRAVIS: What?

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.188
SAM (V.O.): Thanks to ThinkFun for supporting our show.

00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:51.785
MATT: That does make it easier, I guess.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:52.908
Does it say other things in it?

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:56.530
SAM (V.O.): I'm a doll.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.188
MATT: That's effective.

00:04:58.188 --> 00:04:59.940
Let's see if there's more to cycle through.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.838
SAM (V.O.): It's Sam o'clock, baby.

00:05:01.838 --> 00:05:03.003
SAM: I didn't [inaudible] that one.

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:04.369
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Wow.

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:06.170
MATT: How many did you record for this one?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.312
SAM: Actually.
SCARY VOICE OVER: Must Kill Matthew Mercer!

00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:09.303
MATT: All right, we're going to put that away.

00:05:09.303 --> 00:05:10.136
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.337
MATT: All right, third sponsor,

00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:16.520
D&amp;D Beyond!

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.020
Our friends since the beginning of campaign two.
TRAVIS: (hollering) D&amp;D Beyond!

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.450
MATT: You can start your October adventures
with spooky ones,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.880
such as The Ghosts of Saltmarsh.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.780
Explore the waves, spooky waves.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.260
Explore the spooky waves above the depths below

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.640
these five seafaring spooky adventures

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.515
for your party to take on.

00:05:36.515 --> 00:05:37.348
Spoopy now?

00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:38.853
We going into spoopy.

00:05:38.853 --> 00:05:40.250
Get the spoopy stat blocks!

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.420
Rules and anything else you need

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.150
to captain your own spoopy ship.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.620
Battle 56 nautical monsters,

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.120
and use them in your D&amp;D Beyond encounter builder.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.134
Detailed maps and tables from mysterious new spoopy islands

00:05:53.134 --> 00:05:55.200
fishing villages, pirate coves, and more.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.034
So take your journey to the high seas today at

00:05:57.034 --> 00:06:01.221
dndbeyond.link/CRghosts.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.100
That wraps up our sponsorship for tonight

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.930
and for our announcements thereafter

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.100
let's go ahead and begin with you, Ashley.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.302
You got something to talk about.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:09.540
ASHLEY: Hey!

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.855
TRAVIS: Hey, friend!
ASHLEY: Hi, everyone!

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:14.800
So, guys

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.590
and everyone, thank you so much for your support

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.490
of Critical Role Foundation.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.960
So we have far surpassed our initial goal,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.429
but because we are pre-recording the show,

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:32.500
it's a little tough to convey real time fundraising updates,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.080
but just know it's more than a dollar

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.163
and probably less than a million.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:40.780
(laughter)

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.160
But for updates, be sure to check out

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.657
@CriticalRoleFDN

00:06:48.657 --> 00:06:52.850
on Facebook or Twitter for updates, or both.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.740
And for more information or to join us

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.930
in leaving the world better than we found it,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.586
please visit criticalrolefoundation.org.

00:07:01.586 --> 00:07:03.194
(cheering)

00:07:03.194 --> 00:07:05.915
TRAVIS: So happy. It always gets to have some applause.

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:07.223
MATT: Thank you, Ashley. And thank you, everyone,

00:07:07.223 --> 00:07:09.156
for supporting the initial launch

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:12.230
of this long-coming charitable endeavor.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.190
You've blown us all away

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.800
and you've made and continue to make

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.550
a lot of people very happy

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.010
who've been very much in need.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.498
So thank you.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.512
We also have The World of Critical Role book

00:07:22.512 --> 00:07:24.550
coming to the U.S. and Canada

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.260
on Tuesday, October 20th

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.300
and UK on Thursday, October 22nd.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.400
So if you haven't seen this delightful tome.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.290
We showed it off once before.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.130
U.S. and UK fans,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.510
you can still submit your pre-order receipts

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.320
at criticalrolebooks.com/preorder

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.680
to redeem free digital wallpapers and other cool perks.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.700
And for our German fans,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.210
there will also be a fully translated

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.000
German edition available in December of this year.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.850
I'll give you a couple of cool sneak peeks

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.621
of some of the inside of elements of the book here.

00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:55.681
These are some pages about the beginnings.

00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:58.939
We have some storytelling and some shots.

00:07:58.939 --> 00:07:59.772
Oh god, there we go.

00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:01.588
MARISHA: There we go. That's [inaudible].

00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:02.788
MATT: Lighting is in the book.

00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:04.029
LAURA: Those are our house pictures!

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:07.130
MATT: Yeah, so you get to see our janky old apartment.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.810
We've got some awesome chapter breaks

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.943
with some art in there, which is fun.

00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:12.234
TRAVIS: Yo.
MARISHA: Oh, look at us!

00:08:12.234 --> 00:08:13.842
MATT: This is purty.

00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:15.630
I think we got a-- oh yes,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.107
we've got a page about the Chroma Conclave.

00:08:19.107 --> 00:08:22.290
The great evils from campaign one.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.630
It looks gorgeous.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.230
It has a lot of fun stories, interviews,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.330
and historical elements about this weird experience

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.420
that we're still trying to figure out

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.120
how the hell that happened.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.460
And you can get it now, too.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.460
So for more information, head to criticalrolebooks.com.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.542
Laura, you're up next.

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:40.630
LAURA: (yelling)

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.460
Okay, so we've got a lot of stuff in our store right now,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.677
in case you missed it.

00:08:45.677 --> 00:08:47.590
I don't know why Jester just came out.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.780
But, okay.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.530
So number one, I'm just going to go down the list, you guys.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.290
So we've got a wallet.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.727
TRAVIS: Oh my goodness.

00:08:55.727 --> 00:08:58.770
LAURA: With our doodles by Wendy Sullivan.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.435
It's really cute. You want to see it?

00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:01.635
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: I can pass it to you

00:09:01.635 --> 00:09:03.243
because we're married.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.120
MARISHA: So cool.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.278
LAURA: I know.
TRAVIS: It's got a liner.

00:09:07.278 --> 00:09:09.555
LAURA: And there's, like, a little special something in it

00:09:09.555 --> 00:09:10.650
that I'm not going to talk about,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.470
but if you get it, you'll know. Ha!

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.136
Okay.
SAM: Is it money?

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:15.757
LAURA: It's not money.

00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:17.832
MARISHA: A $2 bill in every wallet.
LAURA: The other thing is--

00:09:17.832 --> 00:09:18.830
TRAVIS: Oh, it's this thing.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.090
LAURA: Don't pull it out.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.890
We have our Marquet Market tote bags

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.080
in this fabulous avocado green color.
MARISHA: I love that color.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.380
LAURA: I know. It's so pretty, right?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.213
MARISHA: Cute.
LAURA: So yeah,

00:09:30.213 --> 00:09:32.530
I'm super stoked about that. And then-- hold on.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.736
We've got our--

00:09:33.736 --> 00:09:36.540
Oh, have you seen this yet, Marisha?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.221
We've got our Swoleregard--
MARISHA: I've only seen it over Zoom.

00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:40.054
(cheering)

00:09:40.054 --> 00:09:41.520
LAURA: We have our Swoleregard tank.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.035
TRAVIS: Sun's out, guns out, baby.

00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:45.370
LAURA: This is designed by Grace Berríos.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.203
I love it.

00:09:46.203 --> 00:09:47.570
SAM: What does it say on the bottom?

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.890
LAURA: It says for Swoleregard's Gym, Wildemount, Exandria.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.383
ASHLEY: It's so good. Look at her.

00:09:54.383 --> 00:09:55.380
LIAM: Hitting the gym.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.880
LAURA: Sleeves are bullshit.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.960
Okay, so all three of those things are available

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.230
in the U.S., the UK, and the Australian stores,

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.500
while the--

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.333
Oh wait.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.850
I don't know what I'm saying.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.708
So two of those things are available in all the stores.

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:12.216
And then this thing is only available--

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:14.580
(laughter)

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.270
- in the U.S. store right now,

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.703
but it's coming to the UK and the Australian store soon.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.746
TRAVIS: Nice save, nice save. You're on it.

00:10:23.746 --> 00:10:24.770
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.320
Now we've got another thing to talk about,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.850
because-- this is, like, legit,

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.890
this is the thing

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.390
I think is my favorite thing we've ever made ever.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.990
And I'm going to have Liam show it.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.733
ASHLEY: This is.

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:37.240
MARISHA: Oh yes. Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.100
ASHLEY: I want this so bad.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.950
LAURA: This is our Vax'ildan hooded cloak.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.974
MARISHA: Oh yeah, with that thumb hole.

00:10:44.974 --> 00:10:47.320
LIAM: (hums tune)
MARISHA: Ooh!

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.102
LAURA: It's so sexy.

00:10:50.102 --> 00:10:51.870
Okay. So no, you have to turn around

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.703
because they didn't see the wings.

00:10:52.703 --> 00:10:53.700
ASHLEY: Wait, move your chair back.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.821
LAURA: You've got to show them the wings,

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.571
the Raven Queen wings in the back.

00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:58.561
TRAVIS: Little higher.

00:10:58.561 --> 00:10:59.860
It's got a hood.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.380
SAM: Down for the hood.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.830
LAURA: It's got thumb holes, and there's all these--

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.829
ASHLEY: Come on!

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.512
LAURA: There's all these amazing details.

00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:08.486
Yeah, you've got your--

00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:09.386
LIAM: Snow drops!

00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:11.690
LAURA: Your snow drop close to the heart,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.220
and then we've got a dagger, dagger, dagger detail,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.753
and then we've got, "Do not far from me."

00:11:16.753 --> 00:11:17.586
LIAM: Where is it?!

00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:19.970
LAURA: All sorts of stuff on there.
LIAM: There it is.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.140
LAURA: It's just, like, the most amazing thing.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.610
Anyway, it's in the stores right now.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.700
LIAM: I'll never forget:

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.020
In the before times, I came in,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.440
I didn't know this thing existed

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.880
and you just said, "You want to see something cool?"

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.980
It's like, "Yeah, what are you going to show me?"

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.110
And you showed me pictures of this thing.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.443
I couldn't fucking believe it.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.660
LAURA: (laughs) I'm so excited about it.
LIAM: I love it.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.493
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

00:11:36.493 --> 00:11:38.780
It looked really cool when the lapel was open

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.830
and you could just see the snowdrop.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.390
Kind of open the collar a bit like that.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.266
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:46.042
It's just so good.
LAURA: It's so comfy and cozy.

00:11:46.042 --> 00:11:47.920
I was wearing it today at home.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.261
MATT: It's a good arms dealer outfit.
LAURA: There's pockets!

00:11:50.261 --> 00:11:51.520
LIAM: There's pockets.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.920
SAM: You look like a cool Jedi.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.540
LAURA: Anyway, so there's that.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.100
It's in all three of those stores right now.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.410
So that is pretty cool.
ASHLEY: That is fashion.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.940
LAURA: It's so fashion.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.773
LIAM: Where'd I go?

00:12:00.773 --> 00:12:01.640
SAM: (laughs)

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.482
LAURA: Okay. And then there's two more things

00:12:03.482 --> 00:12:05.320
I'm just going to say, and I'm done. I swear.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.350
MATT: Okay.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.741
LAURA: So for the Australian store--

00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:09.850
SAM: Crikey.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.183
LAURA: We have this t-shirt.

00:12:12.183 --> 00:12:13.641
(cheering)

00:12:13.641 --> 00:12:16.216
(laughter)

00:12:16.216 --> 00:12:17.860
What what!

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.650
That's our Australian store exclusive.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.658
And then--
TRAVIS: Nobody said it?

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.508
LAURA: We have--
SAM and TRAVIS: Bidet, mate!

00:12:24.508 --> 00:12:26.141
LIAM and LAURA: (like Grog) Bidet.

00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:28.610
LAURA: And then we have this t-shirt,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.050
which you may recognize, the design

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.900
is on our tank tops that we released.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.090
SAM: Oh yeah!

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.406
LAURA: So in the Australian store, it's a t-shirt!

00:12:37.406 --> 00:12:38.810
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.536
LAURA: Okay, so that's everything that I've got.

00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:43.690
That's everything I've got.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.231
Thank you for sitting with me.
TRAVIS: Nice job, LB!

00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:47.064
Nice job!

00:12:47.064 --> 00:12:49.814
That's a lot of weeks off to catch up. Nice job.

00:12:49.814 --> 00:12:50.870
ASHLEY: Yeah!
LIAM: Oh!

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.961
LAURA: I know. That's--

00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:53.752
LIAM: I couldn't find them, but there they are.
LAURA: I just love it so much.

00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:55.919
LIAM: I'm so stealthy!
SAM: The other things are cool, too!

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:58.593
LAURA: Everything else is cool, too, but yes, I love that.

00:12:58.593 --> 00:12:59.659
Okay.
MATT: It's pretty cool.

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:01.958
I kind of want the Swoleregard shirt

00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.059
so I can look a little less ridiculous

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:05.466
when I'm doing Ring Fit.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.220
All right. I believe that is all the announcements.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.130
So let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.755

(flames whooshing)

00:14:54.698 --> 00:14:56.031
MATT: And welcome back.

00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:57.489
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:58.832
MATT: I know.

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.050
A little intro change.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.700
LAURA: We didn't even give you any like, things.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.023
We didn't say anything.

00:15:04.023 --> 00:15:05.550
MATT: No, it was just a lot of screaming, which was nice.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.050
It was a reprieve for once.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.106
Yeah. One good thing about the delay

00:15:10.106 --> 00:15:12.750
is it gave us time to do some changes to the intro,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.583
which was nice.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.189
So last we left off:

00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:23.189
The Mighty Nein, after an intense dinner

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.851
with Trent and some individuals from Caleb's past

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:29.230
with Trent and some individuals from Caleb's past

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.660
and making an arrangement with Vess DeRogna

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.990
of the Cerberus Assembly to

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.640
escort her northward towards the ruins

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.890
and the excavation of what seems to be the city of Aeor,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:45.053
a pre-Calamity mageocracy that has been long vanished.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.067
You made your way to Zadash, purchased some things,

00:15:50.067 --> 00:15:52.520
and began to inquire about the whereabouts

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.180
of this individual, Cree,

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.120
that may have had some information

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.430
about this Nonagon figure, Lucien,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.170
and this history that seemed

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.610
to have some weird connection

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.410
with the visions you had while on the island of Rumblecusp.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.940
Upon checking, Cree seemed a bit dodgy

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.870
and not wanting to respond, and then upon scrying,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.960
you found her pushing through a blizzard

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.883
some place far from here.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.930
Feeling a bit odd about these circumstances,

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.490
you went to see if you could glean some information

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.660
from the corpse of your friend, Mollymauk.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.730
You traveled to his resting site where you had buried him,

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.428
not too far from where he fell nearly a year ago.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.270
And upon inspecting the site,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.343
discovered the body was not there.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.800
In the midst of this, Jester,

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.430
you decided to scry upon where

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.628
the body of Mollymauk might be,

00:16:49.501 --> 00:16:54.501
and was given a vision similar to that of Cree.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.710
Another snow-covered, blizzard-battered space

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.081
where you saw, walking,

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:06.681
a familiar purple-skinned tiefling,

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.660
bundled in furs and leathers

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.343
pushing his way through the storm, determined and grinning.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.100
And that's where we left off.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.350
So as you all are scrambling around

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.350
the rainy space surrounding the grave site

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.080
of Mollymauk Tealeaf,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.003
Jester, you return from your vision.

00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:33.550
LAURA: (panting)

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.040
He--

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.733
he's with Cree.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.973
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

00:17:39.973 --> 00:17:41.590
LAURA: He was in the snow.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.640
He was walking.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.788
He was smiling.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.646
ASHLEY: He's alive?
SAM: Did he speak?

00:17:48.646 --> 00:17:52.910
LAURA: I mean, if he did, I didn't hear anything.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.033
He was smiling.

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:00.840
SAM: He wasn't being held captive.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.000
He was there on his own accord?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.300
TRAVIS: Alive, walking.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.795
He looked alive?

00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:08.670
LAURA: (laughs) He looked alive.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.510
TRAVIS: How is that possible?

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.883
MARISHA: Yeah, didn't you send him back to the earth?

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.489
TALIESIN: Well, mostly metaphorically, to be honest.

00:18:18.489 --> 00:18:19.322
MARISHA: What?

00:18:19.322 --> 00:18:21.630
TALIESIN: No, it was just--

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.080
it was just burial rites.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.083
That's not anything that sticks, necessarily.

00:18:30.825 --> 00:18:33.112
LAURA: I'm going to send him a message.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.732
TRAVIS: Whoa, what?
SAM: Why? What message? What?

00:18:35.732 --> 00:18:36.800
LAURA: I want to see what he's doing.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.860
LIAM: Do we maybe want to talk
about this a little bit further

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.940
before you stick your finger into that beehive?

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.640
LAURA: Why?
SAM: Yeah, if you send him a message,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.790
he may-- we'll ruin the element of surprise,

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.270
if that's something that we want to keep.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.860
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if he's trying to find us,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.990
to contact us and he doesn't know--

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.050
LIAM: He's looking in the wrong place.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.450
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: And we've never been there.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.503
MARISHA: He's with Cree.

00:19:02.352 --> 00:19:03.910
I mean, that's someone from his past,

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.960
which means maybe he has some sort of memory,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.723
unless Cree was responsible for helping to bring him back.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.350
SAM: Which could be, right?
TRAVIS: I think that's fairly likely.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.750
SAM: Wasn't she part of that group that did that before?

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.740
MARISHA: Tomb Takers.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.970
LAURA: And she did stuff with blood.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.453
I mean, maybe she knows how to bring people back.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.045
LIAM: He prepared us for this.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.543
MARISHA: We told Cree.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.293
SAM: What?

00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:40.726
MARISHA: We delivered the news that Molly died to Cree,

00:19:40.726 --> 00:19:42.234
didn't we?

00:19:44.842 --> 00:19:47.780
TRAVIS: I don't know. If only one of us took notes.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.330
TALIESIN: I recall that, I believe.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.897
MATT: You told The Gentleman.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.861
MARISHA: Told The Gentleman?

00:19:56.107 --> 00:19:58.340
But Cree was still around at that time.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.503
MATT: Cree was around and working under him at the time.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.269
LIAM: This is surprising,

00:20:06.269 --> 00:20:07.883
but I don't know that we should be--

00:20:07.883 --> 00:20:08.830
MARISHA: Is it that surprising?

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.880
LIAM: -- completely shocked.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.105
No, because he told us his origin story,

00:20:12.105 --> 00:20:15.888
No, because he told us his origin story,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.030
and now he is traveling with the very people

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.796
he was with before

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:26.350
his return from the earth

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.568
the first time, the second time, the ninth time?

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.110
TRAVIS: Just off of Jester's idea,

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.330
because the fucking chances

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.070
of Molly being alive or whoever he is

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.530
also being in the place that we're about to go to

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.880
is extraordinary.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.230
If you send him a message

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.230
and not-Molly doesn't recognize your voice,

00:20:48.613 --> 00:20:49.700
then--

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.260
LAURA: We'll know it's not him, for sure.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.428
TRAVIS: Right.

00:20:52.428 --> 00:20:54.110
LAURA: What if he remembers us?

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.110
TRAVIS: How does a message work?

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.460
If you don't go, "Hi, it's me, Jester,"

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.986
do they know it's you, or just a voice appears?

00:20:59.986 --> 00:21:01.936
LAURA: That's a really good question, Fjord.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.023
I think if they've met me, they know it's me.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.690
MARISHA: But has he met--

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.686
LAURA: Exactly.
MARISHA: -- you?

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:11.519
Okay.

00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:14.602
TALIESIN: I'll also, just to put it out there,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.583
we're not hard people to find.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.930
I mean, if your friend was going to leave word,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.560
he could have, which either means

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.970
that things are different

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:34.250
or that it's for some strange reason,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.470
it's too dangerous to contact you.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.645
MARISHA: We left him a note.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.943
LAURA: We did?
TALIESIN: Where?

00:21:39.943 --> 00:21:42.067
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. I put it in his coat.

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:42.900
LAURA: What did it say?

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.875
SAM: But we found his coat.

00:21:43.875 --> 00:21:45.749
ASHLEY: Wait, is-- let's check.
SAM: Oh, let's look in the coat.

00:21:45.749 --> 00:21:48.220
Is the note still in the coat?

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.312
MATT: No, it is not.

00:21:49.312 --> 00:21:51.610
LAURA: (gasps) They got the note!

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.560
TRAVIS: Did he leave a reply in the coat?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.610
SAM: I'm looking.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.110
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.658
SAM: One.

00:22:00.658 --> 00:22:01.910
MATT: Well, Reliable Talent.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.543
SAM: Sure, but it's still a natural one.

00:22:05.434 --> 00:22:06.742
MATT: Reliable Talent.

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:08.629
Do you want to take the one?
SAM: 23.

00:22:08.629 --> 00:22:11.546
(laughter)

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.340
MATT: A heavy inspection of the interior of the coat,

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.470
and there were a number of pockets sewn into it,

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.633
hidden spaces-- nothing.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.430
SAM: There's this cool flower detail

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.680
and there's this amazing dagger dagger dagger

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.295
thing on the outside, and it's got these fingerless gloves.

00:22:27.295 --> 00:22:28.930
It's really awesome.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.899
TALIESIN: I never noticed the wings on the back.
LAURA: It's really cool.

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:32.481
And it's comfortable, but also sexy.

00:22:32.481 --> 00:22:33.673
SAM: Yeah.

00:22:33.673 --> 00:22:35.923
(laughter)

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.290
ASHLEY: He's got to remember us, right?

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.560
MARISHA: He didn't remember anything
when he woke up before, though.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.410
What if it's just brand new every time,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.101
or maybe Molly was a

00:22:50.101 --> 00:22:52.701
failed version of the ritual,

00:22:52.701 --> 00:22:55.890
and maybe this time it wasn't.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.050
LAURA: But even if I contact him,

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.720
how would it be ruining the surprise?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.560
It's not like they know that we're going there.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.090
I could just be like, "Oh my god, you came back!

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.923
"How are you feeling?"

00:23:05.923 --> 00:23:06.756
SAM: Well, right now,

00:23:06.756 --> 00:23:09.830
I mean, right now you've contacted Cree twice.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.730
LAURA: But just to say like, "Hey, how's Molly?"

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.497
I didn't go like, "Hey Cree--"

00:23:13.497 --> 00:23:16.220
SAM: She doesn't know that you know where she is.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.390
LAURA: Exactly.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.540
SAM: But if you also contact

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.290
Anti-Mauk, what are we going to call it?

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.907
He's not Mollymauk any more.
TRAVIS: Nonagon.

00:23:26.907 --> 00:23:27.757
SAM: Nonagon?

00:23:27.757 --> 00:23:31.580
TALIESIN: Nonagon is right in the middle, I guess.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.710
MARISHA: I guess we could ask him.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.116
ASHLEY: Wait, did you say Mollygon?

00:23:35.074 --> 00:23:35.910
TRAVIS: (laughs) Mollygon.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.090
SAM: Anyway, if we contacted him,

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.280
even if he doesn't recognize you,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.850
he's going to turn to his good friend Cree and be like,

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.100
"Hey, I just heard a voice in my head,"

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.933
and she's going to be like,

00:23:43.933 --> 00:23:47.208
"Oh shit, they're coming for us!"

00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:49.020
TALIESIN: I have to agree.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.240
I think discretion.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.410
LIAM: Yes, I can't think of a reason why not to wait.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.450
We could certainly do it tomorrow or the day after.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.130
The whole point to come here

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.580
was to get inside information

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.710
about where we're going, quietly, and that's gone.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.040
So we don't want to stick a finger in ahead of time.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.960
Maybe we find something new in the next couple of days,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.053
but I agree.

00:24:13.053 --> 00:24:14.899
I think just wait.

00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:16.707
TRAVIS: It's like the sales call, like,

00:24:16.707 --> 00:24:19.550
are you interested in a new HVAC unit?

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.690
Press one to--

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.800
TALIESIN: Can you still talk to plants?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.601
LAURA: Well, yeah, you gave me the ability, after all.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.960
TALIESIN: There gotta be--

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.717
Are there things growing in the earth?

00:24:32.717 --> 00:24:37.707
MATT: Yeah, there are low bushes and some trees.

00:24:37.707 --> 00:24:39.820
TALIESIN: They would know when the earth got dug up.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.747
LAURA: Oh, they would!
TALIESIN: Maybe.

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:42.767
LAURA: Okay.

00:24:42.767 --> 00:24:44.150
TALIESIN: It'll give us a timeline.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.060
LAURA: I'm going to go and talk to a nearby shrub

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.490
or some grass in this area or something.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.022
MATT: Okay, there are elements of

00:24:54.022 --> 00:24:56.346
crabgrass clusters amongst the mud

00:24:56.346 --> 00:24:58.540
as well as some stunted bushes

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.150
and small trees that are scattered

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.527
throughout this plains area.

00:25:02.527 --> 00:25:03.960
LAURA: I'm going to kneel down on the ground

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.526
and get really low and talk to the crabgrass.

00:25:08.398 --> 00:25:09.231
MATT: Okay.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.271
LAURA: Oh, crabgrass.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.410
So just recently, a friend of ours was dug up from the earth

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.320
and came back to life.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.857
Did you feel a great disturbance in the ground lately?

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.453
I don't know.

00:25:26.453 --> 00:25:28.778
MATT: "Yeah, there was some movement."

00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:30.103
(laughter)

00:25:30.103 --> 00:25:31.631
ASHLEY: Oh, come on.
LAURA: There was?

00:25:31.631 --> 00:25:33.550
MATT: "Yeah, there was a guy under there

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.160
"and then some people came by

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.910
"and then they took him out."

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.490
LAURA: There were multiple people that took him out?

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.478
MATT: "Yeah, it was a small group or something."

00:25:41.478 --> 00:25:42.920
LAURA: Wow.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.727
Do you, I mean, I know it's hard to tell time,

00:25:45.727 --> 00:25:49.850
but do you have any idea how many, like, you know,

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.360
suns and moons there were, or hot and colds there were?

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.218
Or, I don't know,

00:25:55.218 --> 00:25:58.406
do you know how long ago it was?
MATT: "I don't follow. I don't--

00:25:58.406 --> 00:26:00.570
"Oh, you just mean, like, a cycle?"

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.060
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.493
MATT: "Like a day/night cycle?"

00:26:03.493 --> 00:26:07.161
LAURA: Oh. Yeah, like a day/night cycle, yeah.

00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:08.343
You're smart.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.773
MATT: "I've never had a conversation like this before!"

00:26:11.773 --> 00:26:13.940
(laughter)

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.410
MATT: "I'm kind of catching myself off guard

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.243
"with the things I know.

00:26:16.243 --> 00:26:17.742
"It's really wild!"

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:20.691
(laughter)

00:26:20.691 --> 00:26:24.867
MATT: "I'd put it at maybe 50 or so cycles back."

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:26.530
LAURA: Wow, that was a while!

00:26:28.032 --> 00:26:29.660
You have a good memory.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.528
MATT: "Well, you know, not all crabgrass is as cool as me."

00:26:32.528 --> 00:26:34.482
(laughter)

00:26:34.482 --> 00:26:35.730
"What's your name, by the way?"

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.600
LAURA: I'm Jester!

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.100
Do you have a name?

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.440
MATT: "I don't think so.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.354
"You wanna give me one?"

00:26:40.354 --> 00:26:41.525
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:43.275
Henry.

00:26:43.275 --> 00:26:45.185
MATT: "I'm Henry.

00:26:45.185 --> 00:26:47.060
"Henry Crabgrass."

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.092
LAURA: Henry Crabgrass, and I'll pet Henry.

00:26:51.092 --> 00:26:52.412
MATT: "Ah, consent, please."

00:26:52.412 --> 00:26:54.173
LAURA: Oh, may I pet you?

00:26:54.173 --> 00:26:55.564
MATT: "Yes, you may."
LAURA: Okay.

00:26:55.564 --> 00:26:57.383
MATT: "Thank you."

00:26:57.383 --> 00:26:58.970
LAURA: I really like this guy.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.250
He's so nice.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.140
SAM: Is Henry a single blade of crabgrass or is he--

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.190
LAURA: A cluster of crabgrass?

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.130
LIAM: A collective Henry, or?

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.910
MATT: You get the sense

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.660
they're not individual ones.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.580
It is a cluster of crabgrass roots

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.640
that encompass a hive crabgrass mind, if you will,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.101
that is now known as Henry.

00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:22.810
LAURA: Henry says it was like 50 days ago

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.783
that Molly came back to life,

00:27:24.783 --> 00:27:27.065
and there were multiple people.

00:27:27.065 --> 00:27:28.028
Did you feel how many people?

00:27:28.028 --> 00:27:30.150
Did you get an idea?

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.891
MATT: "Ah, it's kind of hard to
tell when, you know, you're grass."

00:27:32.891 --> 00:27:35.784
(laughter)

00:27:35.784 --> 00:27:38.409
"I remember feeling a bunch of footprints."

00:27:38.409 --> 00:27:39.360
LAURA: Okay.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.113
TALIESIN: Did Molly come up on his own or?

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.330
LAURA: Oh, when the body came out of the ground,

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.020
was he moving or did he start moving after he was out?

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.240
MATT: "I heard some digging and then I heard some chanting."

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.698
LAURA: (gasps)

00:27:57.698 --> 00:27:58.770
Chanting.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.800
Ooh, that's a good one to know.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.870
Did you hear what they were chanting?

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.015
Can you repeat any of it?

00:28:05.015 --> 00:28:06.420
You have a good memory, after all.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.128
MATT: "I mean, there are limitations
to a grass, apparently."

00:28:09.128 --> 00:28:11.378
(laughter)

00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:15.417
MATT: "I don't even know what language we're talking now."

00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:17.517
(laughter)

00:28:17.517 --> 00:28:20.203
MATT: "To be fair, I don't really know what language is!

00:28:20.203 --> 00:28:21.150
"It's really wild."

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.033
TRAVIS: It's all downhill for Henry from here.

00:28:23.033 --> 00:28:25.554
LAURA: Yeah, existential.

00:28:25.554 --> 00:28:28.109
Henry, is there anything you want?

00:28:28.109 --> 00:28:29.117
Is there anything you need?

00:28:29.117 --> 00:28:30.467
Can I do anything for you?
SAM: Water?

00:28:30.467 --> 00:28:31.433
MATT: "I mean, just stick around.

00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:33.060
"It's nice to have someone to talk to."

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.123
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:28:34.123 --> 00:28:34.956
(worried noise)

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.050
Tell you what, we'll stick around

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.267
for at least 10 more minutes.

00:28:40.267 --> 00:28:42.066
MATT: "I'll take it!"
LAURA: All right.

00:28:42.066 --> 00:28:44.395
(laughter)

00:28:44.395 --> 00:28:46.286
SAM: We can dig up Henry

00:28:46.286 --> 00:28:47.681
and take him with us in, like, a pot.

00:28:47.681 --> 00:28:48.514
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:28:48.514 --> 00:28:50.210
LAURA: Here's the thing. What if Henry is, like--

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.450
Henry seems a little bigger.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.908
What if I accidentally break parts of Henry off?

00:28:53.908 --> 00:28:55.728
LIAM: Yeah, let's not turn this into a horror story.
LAURA: And then we're torturing him?

00:28:55.728 --> 00:28:58.020
TALIESIN: Henry's just going to get eaten.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.720
LAURA: This is bringing up all
sorts of weird stuff, you guys,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.636
because when we step on grass,

00:29:05.636 --> 00:29:06.761
are we hurting it?

00:29:06.761 --> 00:29:08.567
TRAVIS: Oh, you know.

00:29:08.567 --> 00:29:09.462
ASHLEY: Could ask him.

00:29:09.462 --> 00:29:10.700
LAURA: Henry!

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.533
MATT: "Yeah?"

00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:13.272
LAURA: Does it hurt when I step on you?

00:29:13.272 --> 00:29:14.255
MATT: "Well, a little."

00:29:14.255 --> 00:29:15.655
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh no!

00:29:15.655 --> 00:29:17.460
LAURA: Oh god!

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.460
(laughter)

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.378
LAURA: Now I know why Essek flies everywhere:

00:29:22.378 --> 00:29:24.203
he's got a heart of gold.

00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:27.933
MATT: "It's not bad.

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:31.053
"It's just a little pressure tingle."

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.240
LAURA: Okay.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.322
MATT: "I'm used to it. It's kind of what grass does.

00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:37.390
"It gets stepped on."

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.060
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Jester, is the grass upsetting you?

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.213
LAURA: I mean, he's so nice.

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:43.254
TRAVIS: He's not saying terrible things to you?

00:29:43.254 --> 00:29:44.815
I'll summon the--

00:29:44.815 --> 00:29:47.520
LAURA: No, no, Fjord! No, no.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.810
I'm just going to for 10 minutes while we hang out.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.730
I'm just going to, if it's okay, Henry,

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.100
I'm just going to keep petting the grass.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.290
ASHLEY: Does he want any water or anything?

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.915
LAURA: I mean, it's been raining.
We don't want to waterlog him.

00:29:58.915 --> 00:29:59.748
LIAM: It makes you wonder.

00:29:59.748 --> 00:30:02.153
Maybe vegetarians are the real predators.

00:30:02.153 --> 00:30:03.820
(giggles)

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.286
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: Right here.

00:30:05.286 --> 00:30:06.997
(laughter)
LAURA: (gasps)

00:30:06.997 --> 00:30:08.960
Caduceus, you know could speak to plants

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.990
this the whole time.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.823
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:30:10.823 --> 00:30:12.020
LAURA: (gasps)

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.170
Whoa.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:16.870
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, yeah, you sit on a horse,

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.870
these things happen.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.101
ASHLEY: Is he enjoying the pets?

00:30:21.101 --> 00:30:23.843
LAURA: He seemed like he thought it was okay.

00:30:25.643 --> 00:30:26.485
ASHLEY: Scritchy scritchy.

00:30:26.485 --> 00:30:28.663
LAURA: My friend Yasha is petting you, too, now.

00:30:28.663 --> 00:30:30.670
MATT: "All right. Consent, please."

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.720
LAURA: You have to ask if it's okay.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.400
ASHLEY: May I give you scritches, Henry?

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.584
LAURA: She's asking if it's okay.
MATT: "Aw, it's okay."

00:30:37.584 --> 00:30:40.475
LAURA: He says it's okay.
MATT: "Okay. Okay."

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.190
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.390
We're petting crabgrass.

00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:46.610
LAURA: Okay, so what are we going to do?

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.970
If we're not going to call Molly, what are we going to do?

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:50.803
Where are we going?

00:30:50.803 --> 00:30:51.636
What are we doing?

00:30:51.636 --> 00:30:52.570
Because he's up there.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.479
He's alive, and he's walking through the snow.

00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:57.652
TRAVIS: Because you've scryed, does that give us a location

00:30:57.652 --> 00:31:00.960
that we could somehow bamf to, or it doesn't matter?

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.205
LAURA: It's just, no.

00:31:02.205 --> 00:31:03.820
TRAVIS: It's not any closer to his location?

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.877
Hasn't given us an advantage in trying to find him?

00:31:05.877 --> 00:31:09.970
LAURA: I didn't see anything around it other than snow.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.450
SAM: Well, if they're, if they're walking

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:15.780
and they started on this journey 50 days ago,

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.380
they're probably not going very quickly.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.880
I mean, it took them that long to get up there

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.910
and they can't get there any faster.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:23.830
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.510
They're already-- they have such a headstart.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.430
SAM: Yeah, but we can catch up in--

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.650
TALIESIN: They're not walking, are they?

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.230
SAM: -- six seconds.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.720
MARISHA: We don't know how deep
into the tundra that they are.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.210
LIAM: Yeah, and we've already been warned

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.480
that it's squirrelly there with magic.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.650
That delivery to that point might not be as reliable.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.760
SAM: So should we tear up the rest of our plans for the week

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.000
and just go now?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.130
LAURA: I don't think we can leave early.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.930
I think Vess has a set itinerary, right?

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.170
TALIESIN: I'll also say now that we know what's happening,

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.240
between the two of us,

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.240
we have deities and friends to call upon.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.850
We have Locate Creature.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.140
We have a lot of options for keeping tabs on.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.410
TRAVIS: And if we were able to look successfully once,

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:10.421
we could do it again, as long as we're not detected.

00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:11.630
LAURA: Right.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.440
They didn't seem to notice when I did it.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.870
LIAM: Yeah, I'd probably prefer to keep an eye on them,

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.371
but not alarm whoever they are.

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:21.204
TRAVIS: Right.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.950
ASHLEY: That's probably a good idea.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:24.793
TALIESIN: Keep it quiet.

00:32:26.173 --> 00:32:27.270
LAURA: Well, what do we do?

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.280
Where do we go?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.180
What are we doing?

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.580
TRAVIS: Kind of hard to focus after that.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.320
LIAM: Yeah, it's hard not to act.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.570
I understand, Jester, after learning so much.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.080
SAM: Yeah. I mean, I want to talk to Mollymauk,

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.443
but I don't want to blow it.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.630
So maybe we just continue and wait?

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:52.860
Oh god, that sounds awful.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.837
MARISHA: Maybe we can talk to Vess

00:32:54.837 --> 00:32:58.180
and see if she'd be willing to accelerate her plans.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.150
We're also waiting on commissions for some heavy clothing.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.983
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

00:33:02.983 --> 00:33:04.970
I have the best clothes coming, you guys.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.363
I can't wait to wear it.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.240
SAM: I'm a hundred percent with you,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.520
but wait, talk to Vess to accelerate her plans?

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.600
MARISHA: To leave sooner.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.673
SAM: What Fjord said earlier or whoever,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.470
it's very coincidental that Mollymauk and Cree

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.040
are going to the exact same spot we are.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.968
MARISHA: Yeah. It's not.

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.153
That's what I just said.
LIAM: That's literally what Beauregard

00:33:25.153 --> 00:33:26.343
said to us.

00:33:26.343 --> 00:33:27.900
MARISHA: Like an hour ago.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.550
SAM: But yeah, no, I'm definitely paying attention

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.620
but we can't-- should we not tell Vess that

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.745
we know that--

00:33:37.745 --> 00:33:39.860
TRAVIS: There's another interested party.
SAM: -- there's another entity there?

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.200
I mean, she might have sent them, right?

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.310
TALIESIN: Does she know about the Tomb Takers?

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.660
SAM: She has to.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.326
LIAM: Well, that's your thing.
MARISHA: I'd be willing to bet

00:33:47.326 --> 00:33:49.160
that she knows about the Tomb Takers.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.190
None of this is coincidental.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.722
Everything has been pointing to this.

00:33:52.722 --> 00:33:55.380
SAM: We can't ask her to accelerate her plans.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.860
Unless we come up with some excuse

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.850
that doesn't involve the Tomb Takers.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.763
TALIESIN: Unless knowing the truth would work.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.160
Would it?

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.243
LAURA: Didn't they steal her book or something?

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.420
MARISHA: They had a book.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.560
I don't-- we--

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.560
it's a little vague on whose book it was and

00:34:16.633 --> 00:34:21.200
who was running from whom, but she was chasing them down,

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.860
and I think she now has the book.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.101
What if we just loosely ask her--

00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:29.762
LAURA: I'll send her a message.

00:34:29.762 --> 00:34:32.637
And just be like, hey, were you part of the Tomb Takers?

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:34.200
Did they steal your book?

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.330
MARISHA: Either one of two things.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.380
She contracted the Tomb Takers

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.740
or the Tomb Takers contracted her.

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:40.573
TRAVIS: Do it.

00:34:40.573 --> 00:34:43.700
TALIESIN: I feel like this is a conversation for in person.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.070
LIAM: There's also the question, though,

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.560
if she hired the Tomb Takers and she hired us,

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.990
but she did not tell us that she

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:52.270
had any connection to the Tomb Takers.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:54.660
What are we stirring up with?

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.790
MARISHA: I don't think she hired Cree

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.750
and Molly and them this go around.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.093
I think it's an arms race.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.690
LAURA: She's going to want to know that they're out there.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.415
MARISHA: I think whatever they got into before either

00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:13.665
she got wise to whatever Molly and his crew were a part of

00:35:13.665 --> 00:35:14.850
or vice versa.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.120
One infected the other

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.340
and now I think it's a race to the finish line

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.240
because the Tomb Takers haven't been active in two years,

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.690
according to the records from the Cobalt Reserve.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.450
So I don't think she's hired the Tomb Takers.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.870
I think we're the people who are racing against them

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:34.600
for whatever endgame they're both chasing towards.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.360
TALIESIN: The Tomb Takers, Part Two.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.193
LAURA: Yeah.

00:35:37.193 --> 00:35:38.664
TALIESIN: The Two Tomb--
MARISHA: The Tomb--

00:35:38.664 --> 00:35:40.493
TALIESIN: The Tomb-- Tomb Taker--

00:35:40.493 --> 00:35:42.741
MARISHA: Taker's Revenge.
TALIESIN: The Take Twokers.

00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:43.880
LAURA: The Take Tombers!

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.650
No, that's stupid.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:49.130
TRAVIS: I do feel like this is an
opportunity to make up ground

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.355
and otherwise, oh boy.
SAM: An oppor-tomb-ity?

00:35:51.355 --> 00:35:53.270
(laughter)

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.320
LIAM: Mighty Nein did it better.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.150
TRAVIS: I think she'd be interested in going sooner

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.920
if we let her know that other people

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.570
are that far ahead of us.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.236
MARISHA: Right.
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:36:02.236 --> 00:36:04.290
We still need to get our stuff.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.123
LAURA: Yeah.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.096
SAM: Which we ordered ... today?

00:36:11.632 --> 00:36:12.967
LAURA: Today?

00:36:12.967 --> 00:36:14.190
TRAVIS: Yesterday.
LIAM: I think so.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.465
TALIESIN: You can always do a little--

00:36:15.465 --> 00:36:16.352
TRAVIS: ♪ Yesterday. ♪

00:36:16.352 --> 00:36:17.185
LAURA: Yeah.

00:36:18.257 --> 00:36:19.487
Did we order it--?

00:36:19.487 --> 00:36:22.410
TRAVIS: ♪ Love was -- (mumbled "Yesterday" lyrics) ♪

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:26.240
MATT: I believe you ordered them before the dinner.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.225
LAURA: Okay, so yesterday.

00:36:27.225 --> 00:36:28.583
MATT: So yesterday.

00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:29.699
TRAVIS: (quietly) ♪ Yesterday... ♪

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.869
MARISHA: We don't want to go against that estate.

00:36:32.869 --> 00:36:36.969
(laughter)

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.693
TALIESIN: Besides, we're not singing

00:36:38.693 --> 00:36:41.050
"I Talk to the Trees" for a good five minutes.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.020
MATT: Yeah, so you have--

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.010
there's some of the commissions

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.770
that are three more days before they were ready.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.195
MARISHA: Three more days.

00:36:47.195 --> 00:36:48.803
That's still sooner than...

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.268
What day is it?

00:36:52.268 --> 00:36:54.710
It's still sooner than--
TRAVIS: We had like six days left.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.820
MATT: So you still have-- you'd be two days early

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.407
if you were to wait for the commission.

00:36:58.407 --> 00:37:00.679
ASHLEY: Okay, that's something.

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:02.500
SAM: And we can scry once a day, at least.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.940
And if they seem to be getting closer to their goal,

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.040
we can say, all right, we got to go.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.010
TRAVIS: Yeah, or we could go drop more money on those people

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.972
and be like, "Work around the clock."
MARISHA: Work faster.

00:37:10.972 --> 00:37:12.390
I agree with Caduceus, though.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:13.780
I think this is a conversation to have

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.570
with Vess DeRogna in person.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.041
LAURA: Should I let her know we're coming to talk to her?

00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:20.874
TRAVIS: I think so.

00:37:20.874 --> 00:37:21.707
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:37:21.707 --> 00:37:22.633
SAM: Where are we?

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.363
MARISHA: We're--

00:37:24.363 --> 00:37:25.750
LAURA: At Molly's grave.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.870
MARISHA: Halfway between Shadycreek Run and--

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.003
TRAVIS: Your name is Veth.

00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:34.490
SAM: Got all this writing on my arm.
LAURA: Caleb can get us back.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:37.070
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I can take us back to the city.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.117
We need to impose on the same magic circle.
SAM: The city of Rexxentrum?

00:37:40.117 --> 00:37:41.580
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
SAM: Okay.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.448
LAURA: Oh. We're going back to Rexxentrum.

00:37:43.448 --> 00:37:44.639
LIAM: Well, wait.
LAURA: What?

00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:47.072
LIAM: Right. If we're going to see her--

00:37:47.072 --> 00:37:48.370
she was in Rexxentrum, right?

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:49.686
MARISHA: Correct.
MATT: She was in Rexxentrum, yes.

00:37:49.686 --> 00:37:51.118
You previously were in Zadash.

00:37:51.118 --> 00:37:52.451
LIAM: Zadash.
SAM: Where my family is.

00:37:52.451 --> 00:37:53.284
ASHLEY: Wait.
MATT: Where your family is.

00:37:53.284 --> 00:37:56.660
ASHLEY: Anything we were going to do in Shadycreek?

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.955
TRAVIS: We were going to do some research in Shadycreek.

00:37:58.955 --> 00:38:01.990
But I think we figured out everything we needed to, right?

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:04.098
ASHLEY: Yeah,
LAURA: I mean, they're probably all--

00:38:04.098 --> 00:38:06.800
We would just find out they're all up in the north, too.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.010
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.235
TALIESIN: With a night of sleep we could--
SAM: And Zadash is where--

00:38:10.235 --> 00:38:12.689
TALIESIN: -- start asking some questions.
SAM: -- Pumat is and all of our stuff is.

00:38:12.689 --> 00:38:15.600
We can go to Rexxentrum and then go back to Zadash.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.500
MARISHA: Right. We can go to Rexxentrum, talk to her,

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.620
go to Zadash, pick up our stuff and your family,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.188
and-- what are we going to do with your family?

00:38:21.188 --> 00:38:22.688
SAM: We'll figure that out later.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:38:22.688 --> 00:38:24.920
(laughter)

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.693
MARISHA: All right, all right.

00:38:27.693 --> 00:38:29.645
To Rexxentrum?

00:38:29.645 --> 00:38:30.772
SAM: To talk to Vess?

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.100
LIAM: We really could get your--

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.270
As long as we use circles,

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.078
we can go get your family in Zadash

00:38:38.078 --> 00:38:39.460
and then go to Rexxentrum,

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.260
because there's circles in both cities

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.402
and I'm still capable of traveling to both places today.

00:38:44.402 --> 00:38:45.235
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:47.540
So we go to Zadash,

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.863
we drop more money on these people,

00:38:48.863 --> 00:38:51.003
we'll be like, "Go faster with your commissions,"

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.340
pick up family, then to Rexxentrum,

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.157
then go back to Zadash, then go back to Rexxentrum,

00:38:57.157 --> 00:38:58.257
and then head out.

00:38:58.257 --> 00:39:00.450
TALIESIN: Or we just take a couple of days.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.930
SAM: Pick up my family.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.610
They can stay in Zadash for a couple of days.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:04.443
It's fine.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.210
TALIESIN: I also think a couple
more days figuring out what we know

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.010
might be-- like, are they actually going to the same place

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:14.509
that we're going? Let's confirm that.
LAURA: I can send them a message.

00:39:14.509 --> 00:39:15.683
TALIESIN: No, no, we can just--

00:39:16.808 --> 00:39:20.090
I just figured Commune might do it.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.320
LAURA: Oh, or you can ask your god, right.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.153
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:39:23.153 --> 00:39:24.569
SAM: Do it.
LAURA: Gods know a lot of things.

00:39:24.569 --> 00:39:27.960
TALIESIN: They do, and your friend seems to know some stuff.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.498
LAURA: Yeah, he knows a lot.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.548
SAM: Do it, Rockapella.

00:39:31.548 --> 00:39:34.129
TALIESIN: He's got a nice-- well, we have to wait a day.

00:39:34.129 --> 00:39:35.400
SAM: Oh.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.670
Don't do it, Rockapella.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.560
TRAVIS: Rock-a-doodle?

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.670
LAURA: I could do it.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.860
No, I don't know if I could.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.930
Hold on, let me look.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.240
I could do it today, but I already communed.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.899
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think it gets weird if you keep doing it,

00:39:46.899 --> 00:39:48.280
if I recall.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.340
LAURA: Let's go to Rexxentrum.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.173
SAM: Okay!

00:39:50.173 --> 00:39:51.630
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.610
I'm going to send a message to your dude.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.843
Who am I sending message to, to let them know we're coming?

00:39:56.843 --> 00:39:58.050
MARISHA: Yudala Fon.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.130
LAURA: I'm going to send the message to Yudala Fon.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.400
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.260
MATT: All right, what do you say?

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.060
LAURA: Ey-oh, we're coming through!

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.010
Get ready because it's happening right now.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.081
MARISHA: It's Beau with the Mighty Nein.

00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:13.822
LAURA: It's Beau with the Mighty Nein coming through

00:40:13.822 --> 00:40:17.072
any second now.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.285
MATT: Brief pause before they respond with a,

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:28.253
"A very curious notification,

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.122
"but of course, you are welcome."

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.343
That's all.
LAURA: Cool.

00:40:34.343 --> 00:40:36.750
LIAM: Is it still raining on us?

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:37.930
MATT: At the grave? Yes.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.560
LIAM: So "any second" really means about a half hour

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.450
because first I will ritually cast the dome

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.440
and then I'll pull out some rags and start wiping

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.468
down the stone that I have found to draw the circle on.

00:40:48.468 --> 00:40:50.601
MARISHA: Can't you draw it in the mud?

00:40:50.601 --> 00:40:52.180
LIAM: No, the chalk does not--

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.361
no, it cannot hold.

00:40:53.361 --> 00:40:55.790
LAURA: Can you just dig in the mud with your finger?
MARISHA: Yeah, with your finger?

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.970
LIAM: It's not mud drawing.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.923
It involves chalk.

00:40:59.923 --> 00:41:01.431
There are ingredients.

00:41:01.431 --> 00:41:02.265
There's ways that--

00:41:02.265 --> 00:41:03.098
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

00:41:03.098 --> 00:41:05.092
I think it is a pretty lax rules.
SAM: Put a bunch of stones in a circle?

00:41:05.092 --> 00:41:06.342
LIAM: Caleb stops talking to them.

00:41:06.342 --> 00:41:07.175
TRAVIS: Have you tried?

00:41:07.175 --> 00:41:09.733
(laughter)

00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:11.520
SAM: Just draw it on Henry.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.180
MATT: If you want to, you can search for a stone surface

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.630
that might function for this.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.510
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that's what I'm saying, it is out in this field

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.000
finding a large enough stone, putting up--

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.285
spending 10 minutes to ritually cast the dome,

00:41:23.285 --> 00:41:25.500
wiping that shit down for a couple of minutes.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.827
So 25 to 30-ish minutes later.

00:41:27.827 --> 00:41:28.660
LAURA: Henry.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.860
LIAM: Easy peasy.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.635
MATT: "Hey, yeah?"

00:41:31.635 --> 00:41:33.750
LAURA: Do you know of any big stones in the area?

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.010
Big enough for a bunch of people to stand on?

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:40.330
MATT: "There's maybe a couple of stones nearby.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:44.040
"A little bit that way and like right over there.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.873
"That's all I know."

00:41:44.873 --> 00:41:47.090
LAURA: Am I noticing any kind of shifts in the blades

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.880
as he says that way and that way?

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.370
MATT: No.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.753
You just hear it in the voice.

00:41:52.753 --> 00:41:55.277
LAURA: There's some over that way and some over that way.

00:41:55.277 --> 00:41:56.110
SAM: (laughs)

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.980
MATT: You look over and there's, like, some stones,

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.733
like, six inches, four inches.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.715
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: That's grass.

00:42:03.715 --> 00:42:05.090
(laughter)

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.440
MATT: Make a perception check if you want to

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.390
with disadvantage because of the heavy rain.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:09.223
LIAM: Sure.

00:42:09.223 --> 00:42:10.664
TRAVIS: How long does that spell stay up?

00:42:10.664 --> 00:42:12.490
LAURA: I don't know.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:13.637
LIAM: Investigation, you say?

00:42:13.637 --> 00:42:14.470
MATT: No, this is perception.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:15.695
LIAM: Perception, you say.

00:42:15.695 --> 00:42:16.648
That is a 21.

00:42:16.648 --> 00:42:17.560
TRAVIS: Woo!

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.640
MATT: Nice, with disadvantage? All right.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.790
Yeah, so within 15 minutes or so you find near the base,

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.480
the eastern side of the base of some of the rolling hills

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.850
that signify the area where that fight

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.800
where you lost Mollymauk happened,

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.380
there are some sections of heavy stone,

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.270
probably volcanic bombs from a long time ago

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:37.103
that were launched here.

00:42:37.103 --> 00:42:39.030
That's going to be more akin

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:44.030
to the mountainous rock that surrounds the valley.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:46.930
But you find a few sections there that are a little flatter.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.870
It's still not a perfect flat surface,

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:52.260
but it is large enough. If you push some of the mud away

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.810
and put the dome over and dry it off for a moment,

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.417
you could probably get it to work.

00:42:57.417 --> 00:43:00.487
LIAM: Okay, and this is the kill site for Molly, you say?

00:43:00.487 --> 00:43:01.875
MATT: Not far from it, yeah.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.560
LIAM: I'll take that time to do it.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.060
People can huddle in out of the rain, if they want.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.870
And I'm getting my Dynasty clothing

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.620
totally wrecked and muddy and disgusting.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.733
So it's good that what's old is new again,

00:43:20.739 --> 00:43:22.400
and good that we're getting new clothing

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.163
and I will finish it off.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.053
Everybody in.

00:43:27.178 --> 00:43:28.220
MATT: (rapid whooshing)

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.920
You all jump into the teleportation circle

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.240
and emerge in the base of the Rexxentrum archive.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.220
The familiar, warm interior is welcoming

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.560
due to the previously very cold and damp outside

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.540
of which you have been suffering

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.623
for the past 30, 40 minutes or so.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.220
Nobody seems to be bothered by your presence,

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.400
as you did announce yourself.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.600
And you make your way up to the streets

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.250
of Rexxentrum without issue.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.399
Whereabouts would you like to go?

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:57.680
LAURA: Should we go talk to Vess?

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.010
MARISHA: Yeah, should we check in with her?

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.073
Do you need to do another thing or?

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.070
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.762
I'll send a message to Vess DeRogna.

00:44:06.762 --> 00:44:07.595
MATT: Okay.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.940
LAURA: Hi!

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.360
We're coming to see you.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.320
It's super important.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.431
Are you at home?

00:44:16.431 --> 00:44:17.310
Where are you?

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.603
We need to talk.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.513
Any second now.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.196
TRAVIS: I'm out of practice. That shit's hard.

00:44:24.196 --> 00:44:27.600
MATT: She responds, "I am not home at the moment.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.600
"However, I can be there within the next four or so hours

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.218
"if you'll be around."

00:44:35.218 --> 00:44:38.320
LAURA: She says she'll be home in four or so hours.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.320
ASHLEY: We could try to hurry up our jackets.

00:44:43.465 --> 00:44:45.126
TRAVIS: She's with Molly.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:45.126 --> 00:44:47.040
LAURA: (gasps)

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.873
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes?

00:44:48.823 --> 00:44:49.656
SAM: No.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.313
Anything else we can do here?

00:44:52.313 --> 00:44:54.303
Should we just fast forward four hours?

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.018
LAURA: Yeah, we can just go to her house and wait,

00:44:58.018 --> 00:44:59.500
I suppose.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.780
Should I send that message?

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.800
MARISHA: Warm pretzel?

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.260
LAURA: Warm pretzel, definitely, and, like, some cocoa,

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.299
because it was pretty cold.

00:45:07.299 --> 00:45:08.328
TALIESIN: Oh, cocoa and pretzel.

00:45:08.328 --> 00:45:09.161
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:45:09.161 --> 00:45:10.745
Like sailing through a storm.

00:45:10.745 --> 00:45:14.756
MARISHA: We go get warm pretzels and cocoa and mulled wine.

00:45:14.756 --> 00:45:16.234
LAURA: Ooh!
MARISHA: That sounds so good.

00:45:16.234 --> 00:45:19.716
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you can totally acquire these things

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:20.980
with a short jaunt through a number

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.255
of the various shopping districts here in Rexxentrum.

00:45:23.255 --> 00:45:27.040
The city is diverse in its offerings.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.130
It doesn't take you too long to acquire what you're seeking.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.500
I'd say, if you're getting that for the group,

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.549
go ahead and mark off one and a half gold

00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:36.900
for the lot of it.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.530
MARISHA: It's on me, you guys.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:39.600
It's on me.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.040
TALIESIN: Is it like the German Christmas markets

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.800
where you get a discount if you return the cup,

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.720
but otherwise you get the commemorative cup?

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.870
MATT: Sure.
TRAVIS: Wow. Good call.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.650
TALIESIN: I want a stein, man.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.910
MATT: You can have a Rexxentrum stein, if you'd like.

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:54.767
TALIESIN: Every year it's a different-- you collect them.

00:45:54.767 --> 00:45:56.590
LIAM: Oh man.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:57.423
Now I want it.

00:45:57.423 --> 00:45:58.740
TALIESIN: I miss [inaudible].

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.656
MATT: If you want to pay a little extra, you can get

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:02.530
some Rexxentrum steins and add it to your inventory.

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:04.460
TALIESIN: I will gladly put that in for the group.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.626
MATT: Go for it. Two additional silver per stein.

00:46:06.626 --> 00:46:07.516
You're good to go.

00:46:07.516 --> 00:46:08.882
TALIESIN: Two, four, six.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.160
MATT: If you want them engraved with your name,

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.211
it's an extra silver.

00:46:12.211 --> 00:46:13.877
LAURA: (gasps)
TALIESIN: 17, 18, 19...

00:46:13.877 --> 00:46:14.777
(laughter)

00:46:14.777 --> 00:46:16.660
TALIESIN: I'm going to get some for the family.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.351
SAM: Sure, yeah. Get one for my child.

00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:20.202
TALIESIN: All right, I'm just going to--

00:46:20.202 --> 00:46:22.470
LAURA: I'm adding that to my other possessions.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.170
LIAM: Best part about them is you almost cannot lift them.

00:46:26.571 --> 00:46:28.537
TRAVIS: Yeah. Brutal.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.030
MATT: All righty.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.477
It is not raining here in Rexxentrum,

00:46:32.477 --> 00:46:34.666
but the sky is still cloudy and gray.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.940
It is, I'd say, at this point in the day,

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.720
starting to push towards later afternoon,

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.119
about the time that you've been doing this

00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:44.750
and you guys were also looking for-- to what else?

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.793
What else did you want to accomplish in the interim?

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.760
LAURA: Anybody want to see if they could

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.000
quickly hurry their commissions?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.670
SAM: Did we order these things here?

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.003
LAURA: No, no, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm stupid.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.543
SAM: I honestly don't remember.
MATT: The clothing,

00:47:00.543 --> 00:47:02.320
I believe, you ordered here,

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.253
and then the magical item that you ordered was--

00:47:05.253 --> 00:47:06.086
TALIESIN: Back there.

00:47:07.664 --> 00:47:09.372
MATT: Pumat, back in Zadash.

00:47:09.372 --> 00:47:11.376
SAM: Clothes here.
MARISHA: You're right.

00:47:11.376 --> 00:47:12.776
TRAVIS: Let me just check my notes.

00:47:12.776 --> 00:47:14.426
Yeah, Rexxentrum.

00:47:14.426 --> 00:47:16.242
MARISHA: Yep. (laughs)
TRAVIS: Right there.

00:47:16.242 --> 00:47:18.893
SAM: You're looking at a receipt from Bennigan's.

00:47:18.893 --> 00:47:21.320
(laughter)

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.170
TRAVIS: The Monte Cristo is really good.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.686
(laughter)

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.870
SAM: Let's speed up our clothes.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:33.531
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'll be fun.
LAURA: I don't know if I can.

00:47:33.531 --> 00:47:34.364
SAM: What do you mean?

00:47:34.364 --> 00:47:36.430
LAURA: They said that mine's complicated.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:37.263
SAM: Money.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.730
LAURA: I gave them a lot of money already.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.040
SAM: I have money.
TALIESIN: Do I have to say it again?

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.200
It's just always true.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.430
It's just nine women can't make a baby in a month.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.903
Money can only do so much.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.720
LAURA: They seemed kind of annoyed at me.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.670
TRAVIS: Maybe they could give you something in the interim,

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.920
like warm clothing until the really nice--

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.853
LAURA: <i>Fjord!</i>

00:47:57.853 --> 00:47:59.369
How am I going to get the really nice stuff

00:47:59.369 --> 00:48:00.444
if we're all the way up north?!

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:02.780
I want my pretty things that I ordered!

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.310
TRAVIS: You could come back for--

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.368
LAURA: <i>Fjord!</i>

00:48:06.727 --> 00:48:08.552
TRAVIS: I feel like I'm learning something new.

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.150
(laughter)

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.130
TALIESIN: I also don't have any armor on right now.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.570
That's kind of a problem.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.580
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.510
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.468
LIAM: Travis, I don't really think you are.

00:48:17.468 --> 00:48:19.551
(laughter)

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.106
TRAVIS: You are ridiculous.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.482
Ridiculous.

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.319
ASHLEY: I want to try to make a shot from here.

00:48:29.319 --> 00:48:30.661
TRAVIS: Is that Wingdings?

00:48:30.661 --> 00:48:32.863
(laughter)

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.813
LIAM: Serious storytelling.

00:48:35.813 --> 00:48:36.646
MATT: Yeah.

00:48:36.646 --> 00:48:38.530
TRAVIS: Do we want to stay-- yeah, let's go ask.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:39.596
MARISHA: Never hurts to ask, right?

00:48:39.596 --> 00:48:40.930
TRAVIS: Let's go ask.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:42.390
Maybe they were super inspired

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:43.670
and they were like, "Oh my god,

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.144
"I've been embroidering all night.

00:48:46.144 --> 00:48:47.670
"You unlocked my mind."

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.300
TRAVIS: The shopkeeper's got a bunch of family members

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.800
that are also very skilled.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.290
MARISHA: Yeah, no, it was a family project.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:54.827
Like making quilt.

00:48:54.827 --> 00:48:56.369
TALIESIN: It's going to fall apart halfway through.

00:48:56.369 --> 00:48:57.407
LIAM: Job of a lifetime.
TRAVIS: Let's try it.

00:48:57.407 --> 00:48:59.277
MATT: Most of your outfits will be ready

00:48:59.277 --> 00:49:01.563
by the end of this evening,

00:49:01.563 --> 00:49:05.158
if not the next morning, except for yours,

00:49:05.158 --> 00:49:09.200
which required some very specific elements there.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.304
Upon asking, for an additional 30 gold,

00:49:12.304 --> 00:49:15.883
they can get the extra hands to rush it.

00:49:17.301 --> 00:49:22.301
LAURA: Okay. Okay, sure, here's 30 more gold.

00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:25.960
MATT: "All right, thank you very much."
MARISHA: You look like you have reservations?

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.630
LAURA: I just don't have any money left

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:29.640
because I spent it all on these clothes.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.972
MARISHA: Well, let me. I cover Jester.

00:49:31.972 --> 00:49:33.346
I cover Jester.

00:49:33.346 --> 00:49:35.995
Yeah, I'm a monk.

00:49:35.995 --> 00:49:39.488
SAM: Can we pay a little extra
if they hire nine pregnant women?

00:49:39.488 --> 00:49:42.405
(laughter)

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.103
MARISHA: I cover Jester.

00:49:44.103 --> 00:49:45.769
Put money back.
TALIESIN: A good rule of life.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.210
MATT: So thus all the rest of the

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.190
currently outstanding outfits that have been commissioned,

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:54.220
will be ready by the next morning.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.880
SAM: Sweet.
LAURA: Wow!

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.900
MATT: Except for your armor piece in Zadash,

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.300
which will be two more days.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.727
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:50:01.727 --> 00:50:03.880
TRAVIS: Is that Pumat?
MATT: Two to three more days.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.000
Because it was four days for the piece to be complete.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.985
TRAVIS: He can make another Pumat.

00:50:07.985 --> 00:50:09.510
Let's go.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.756
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, we'll go.

00:50:11.756 --> 00:50:14.839
We'll rush him when we get to Zadash.
TALIESIN: That's a whole thing just getting there anyway.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.590
MATT: At this point, with the conversations being had,

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:21.970
hopping from location to location

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.550
to ensure things will be ready for you

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.090
in the time you wish to leave,

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.470
right now the sun is close to setting the sky.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:29.930
The clouded evening sky

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.443
begins to grow darker and more purple.

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.110
What would you like to do?

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:37.443
Roughly three, three and a half hours have passed.

00:50:37.443 --> 00:50:40.243
LAURA: Oh, we should head to her house.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.673
I'll send her a message,

00:50:44.673 --> 00:50:45.980
because I realized I never let her know

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.230
that that was indeed something we were doing.

00:50:49.736 --> 00:50:51.323
MATT: Okay.

00:50:51.323 --> 00:50:53.080
LAURA: Okay, okay, we're on our way to your place.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.450
Hopefully you'll be there soon

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:55.810
because we're on our way.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:59.270
TRAVIS: This is not Guitar Hero. Slow down.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:00.970
LAURA: It's Jester, by the way.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:03.583
Can't wait to see you.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.793
MATT: "Very well.

00:51:06.793 --> 00:51:08.610
"I will see you there soon enough.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.683
"I'm just finishing up some of my work.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.833
"If I'm not there when you arrive, just be patient."

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.165
LAURA: She said be patient.

00:51:20.165 --> 00:51:22.690
SAM: Patience is our middle name.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:23.857
TRAVIS: Molly, this armor--

00:51:23.857 --> 00:51:26.373
are you saying that we would go on this--

00:51:26.373 --> 00:51:28.658
MARISHA: Did you just call him Molly?
TRAVIS: Jesus fucking balls.

00:51:28.658 --> 00:51:30.460
(laughter)

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.010
LIAM: It's really not that surprising

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:35.261
with the events of the day, Fjord.

00:51:35.261 --> 00:51:37.090
TRAVIS: A little sediment on the ocean floor

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.464
just got kicked up like crazy. It'll settle.

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:43.907
Caduceus, the armor that you're waiting to get,

00:51:43.907 --> 00:51:45.545
are you saying we would leave

00:51:45.545 --> 00:51:47.780
and go without you getting this armor?

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.010
TALIESIN: Say we pick up the armor and leave immediately.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:51.651
TRAVIS: Okay. Get the armor first.

00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:54.898
TALIESIN: Get the armor and 10
minutes later we're on the way.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:57.823
SAM: Excellent thinking, Percival.

00:51:57.823 --> 00:52:01.400
(laughter)

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.900
LIAM: I mean, he is wearing purple.

00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:06.655
TRAVIS: I don't know what I've been thinking of

00:52:06.655 --> 00:52:07.850
over the past few weeks.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.413
MARISHA: How transparent are we going to be with Vess?

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.900
SAM: I mean, Caduceus is with us.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.940
So we'll tell the truth, I guess.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.250
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a good point.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.100
You should drop one little nugget of information

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.970
at a time and maybe have Caduceus see how she's reacting.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:28.170
TALIESIN: We can just start with letting her know

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:32.440
that the Tomb Takers might be heading to the same place

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.373
and see if she knows who that is.

00:52:35.373 --> 00:52:36.840
TRAVIS: The names?

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.310
TALIESIN: Well, and she might be able to fill in a bunch

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:40.260
that we don't know.

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:42.653
I mean...

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:47.526
Uh-oh, we activated--
MARISHA: The names, I just got to find

00:52:47.526 --> 00:52:49.830
the names of the rest of the Tomb Takers.

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.488
LIAM: The music even synced up to her grabbing it.

00:52:51.488 --> 00:52:52.573
TRAVIS: I know.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:52:52.573 --> 00:52:53.950
TRAVIS: If Marisha's eyes can turn white

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.723
and roll back in her head, they would.

00:52:55.723 --> 00:52:57.300
(laughter)

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:02.150
ASHLEY: Otis, Zorel, and...Tyforel?

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.230
MARISHA: Tyffial?

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.262
ASHLEY: No, Tyffial.

00:53:05.262 --> 00:53:06.511
SAM: And Cree.

00:53:06.511 --> 00:53:07.935
LAURA: And Cree.
MARISHA: And Cree.

00:53:07.935 --> 00:53:09.753
SAM: And--
SAM and LAURA: Nonagon.

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:10.586
SAM: Lucien.

00:53:12.718 --> 00:53:13.551
Okay.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.170
Do we have any gifts or anything for good old Vess?

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.087
TRAVIS: A bottle of wine?

00:53:20.087 --> 00:53:21.430
TALIESIN: I bought an extra stein.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:23.940
Bought a few.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.340
SAM: Cool.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.373
LAURA: Oh, and Zoran. Did you say Zoran?

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.493
TRAVIS: Who's Zoran?

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.630
LAURA: Zoran is one of the--

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:34.921
TRAVIS: Tomb Takers?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:37.080
LIAM: Maybe as a start we just mention

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.957
that we've heard another group is already

00:53:39.957 --> 00:53:41.320
ahead of us and give it a beat.

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.678
See how she takes it.

00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:44.020
See how she reacts.

00:53:46.482 --> 00:53:48.110
MARISHA: I got to find my page.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:49.460
SAM: I will knock on the door.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.550
MATT: As you arrive at the familiar exterior

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:54.870
of Vess DeRogna's tower,

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:55.840
you go to knock on the door,

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.661
and as your hand extends, the door

00:53:58.661 --> 00:54:00.590
(creaking)

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:01.656
opens.

00:54:01.656 --> 00:54:03.910
Hand passes into the air.

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:06.647
The interior furniture is completely different

00:54:06.647 --> 00:54:08.660
from last time you were here.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.400
The floor has a deep,

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.400
velvet green pattern carpet across.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.800
You can see the furniture has been arranged to be

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.400
like a tea table in the middle

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.440
with four chairs and a cross formation on it.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.620
You can see an iron chandelier hanging

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.620
from the center of the ceiling

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.523
with candles around it that are lit.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.840
There looks to be a really,

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.890
really nice painting on the wall,

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:34.590
across to the right of you

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.990
that depicts a lush jungle with different colors

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:42.140
that seemed to fade and change.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.380
And you see different shapes and designs emerge

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.290
then disappear into it.

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:49.650
It's a very trippy piece of enchanted art.

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.220
The same staircase curves upward,

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.510
but other than that, it is an unfamiliar interior

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:57.740
to when you were last here.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.870
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to the painting?

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:01.210
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.500
TRAVIS: Can I touch it?

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:03.333
MATT: You can.

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:04.191
LIAM: On brand.

00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:06.050
MATT: So as you reach out

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:07.710
and touch the exterior of this painting,

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:08.900
your hand presses against it,

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.260
and you watch the color ripples off of it,

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.580
like the pressure caused

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.963
the enchantment to react to the heat.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.860
TALIESIN: The oils on your hand are just going to make

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.249
that thing fall apart faster.

00:55:21.249 --> 00:55:23.537
We lose precious art every year that way.

00:55:23.537 --> 00:55:24.471
TRAVIS: I feel terrible now.

00:55:26.005 --> 00:55:27.510
Is anything moving in there?

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.050
Anything looking out from the painting?

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:31.350
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.870
TRAVIS: 14.

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:36.703
MATT: 14.

00:55:36.703 --> 00:55:38.770
You see occasionally in the shadow

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:41.070
what looks to be a set of glowing eyes

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:42.790
that occasionally blinks,

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:45.370
and then subsides into the shadow

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:47.960
and seems to appear elsewhere in the painting

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.815
and look out in your direction.

00:55:49.815 --> 00:55:51.265
LAURA: Can you smack the eyes?

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:54.210
I'm saying over your shoulder,

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:55.043
because I'm watching you do it.

00:55:55.043 --> 00:55:56.709
TRAVIS: Do you see them, too?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:55:56.709 --> 00:55:58.610
TRAVIS: I mean, I could try.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:00.230
What if it's a real thin membrane

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:02.530
and I just fall through it?

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:03.550
LAURA: Just smack it lightly.

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:06.203
TRAVIS: I'll smack it lightly on the eyes.

00:56:06.203 --> 00:56:08.030
MATT: Okay, as you smack the painting in the eyes,

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.860
you hear, "Ack!"

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.490
And suddenly in a rush of air,

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:14.873
something like a heavy bat

00:56:14.873 --> 00:56:16.260
flutters out past your face.

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.198
You end up instinctually pulling back

00:56:18.198 --> 00:56:19.770
and your arms go wild as you watch

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:22.108
something winged emerge from the side of this wall

00:56:22.108 --> 00:56:22.941
(fluttering)

00:56:22.941 --> 00:56:23.940
around the room in a circle,

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.160
before landing at the top of the room

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.330
at the top of the arch chamber,

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:29.130
you can see this little wooden ledge

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:31.780
that marks where the ceiling meets the wall,

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.760
and this tiny, humanoid, scrawny, gnarled creature

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.093
with leathery wings is going.

00:56:36.093 --> 00:56:37.093
"Ah!"

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:39.564
TRAVIS: I'm sorry! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I hit the--

00:56:39.564 --> 00:56:40.632
MATT: (snarls)

00:56:40.632 --> 00:56:42.050
TRAVIS: (screams)

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:43.490
MATT: Flies up the stairs.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:45.340
LIAM: I-- wait! Oh.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.173
TRAVIS: That was my fault?

00:56:46.173 --> 00:56:47.440
SAM: Was that an imp?

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.973
TRAVIS: I don't know. Did it look like an animal,

00:56:48.973 --> 00:56:49.970
or did it look like a--

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:52.440
MATT: It looked like a small fiendish
humanoid with leathery wings.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.563
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:56:55.563 --> 00:56:58.040
TRAVIS: I mean, I just figured--

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.200
I'm not sure what I figured.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.093
I didn't think it was going to come out.

00:57:00.093 --> 00:57:01.010
LAURA: I didn't think so either.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:03.320
I thought that it was just a magic picture.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.270
I didn't know.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:07.490
MARISHA: Please slap every painting you come across.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.023
TRAVIS: You can count on me.

00:57:09.023 --> 00:57:10.900
(laughter)

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.980
LIAM: Maybe don't go poking any more things

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.855
in these wizard towers.

00:57:14.855 --> 00:57:16.995
TRAVIS: Are there any sculptures in this room?

00:57:16.995 --> 00:57:18.742
MATT: (laughs)

00:57:18.742 --> 00:57:21.525
LAURA: She said to be patient if she's not here.

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:23.820
LIAM: Doing great.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:25.211
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:57:25.211 --> 00:57:27.070
TRAVIS: I'm sure she won't notice a thing.

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.430
MATT: The new hero's journey for Fjord.

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:32.682
One man's war against all forms of artistic expression.

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:34.021
TRAVIS: Stained glass, oil painting.

00:57:34.021 --> 00:57:36.271
(laughter)

00:57:39.035 --> 00:57:39.940
MATT: Do you guys have a seat,

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.770
or do you make your way up the stairs?

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:44.710
TRAVIS: Around the little tea set?

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:46.800
Is that a tea set on the table?

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.146
MATT: There is a small tea table.

00:57:48.146 --> 00:57:49.730
There's no tea set on it currently,

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:52.520
but it is small enough and compact enough

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.425
to not be a full spread.

00:57:55.425 --> 00:57:57.640
TRAVIS: Before any of you cause any more trouble,

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.683
I'm going to sit on my hands.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.950
SAM: I guess we'll sit and wait.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:04.130
LAURA: Yeah, I'm just going to take

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.290
a few steps up the staircase and look.

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:08.123
MATT: Okay.

00:58:08.123 --> 00:58:08.956
LAURA: Do I see anything?

00:58:08.956 --> 00:58:10.810
MATT: You slowly step up, and as you do,

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:13.398
the wood creaks slightly with the weight shift.

00:58:13.398 --> 00:58:16.850
(creaking)

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.860
As you glance around the side,

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.470
this very faint bit of torchlight

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.570
seems to be slightly flickering

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:24.770
and bouncing from the upward curved wall,

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:26.340
and you see a shadow begin to stretch

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.260
across that side of the wall heading in your direction,

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.186
and you hear footsteps.

00:58:30.186 --> 00:58:31.891
LAURA: Vess?

00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:33.370
MATT: "I'll be right there."

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:34.270
LAURA: Oh, you're here!

00:58:35.327 --> 00:58:37.260
MATT: And you see, stepping down the staircase,

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.700
meeting your position, Vess.

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:43.470
This time dressed in a comfortable deep blue

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:45.900
set of lounge robes.

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.520
The sleeves are very long

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.370
and dragging down to almost the knee.

00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:52.201
It splits around the waist

00:58:52.201 --> 00:58:56.491
and drags about five or six feet behind her along the stairs

00:58:56.491 --> 00:58:59.261
as it droops down with each progressive step.

00:59:01.021 --> 00:59:04.342
She's not wearing a lot of the jewelry that she had

00:59:04.342 --> 00:59:06.231
in a more presentational fashion last time you saw her.

00:59:06.231 --> 00:59:11.231
This is definitely more of a casual gathering.

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:14.341
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were working within the city,

00:59:14.341 --> 00:59:17.051
but I would say you're working somewhere else, huh?

00:59:17.051 --> 00:59:18.831
Were you on another plane of existence

00:59:18.831 --> 00:59:21.161
doing crazy magical things?

00:59:21.161 --> 00:59:22.579
MATT: "More or less.

00:59:23.531 --> 00:59:27.471
"So..." And she continues down the stairs,

00:59:27.471 --> 00:59:29.857
waiting for you to make way.

00:59:29.857 --> 00:59:32.253
LAURA: I'll lean against the banister so she can pass by me.

00:59:32.253 --> 00:59:35.361
MATT: She awkwardly squeezes past you

00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:38.469
with a tiny bit of space, (laughs).

00:59:38.469 --> 00:59:42.881
"Ahem." Makes her way down towards where the table is,

00:59:42.881 --> 00:59:47.021
and she, looking around at the center of the chamber,

00:59:47.021 --> 00:59:49.601
gives a bit of a shrug and whispered word under her breath.

00:59:49.601 --> 00:59:52.981
And you watch as the four chairs suddenly divide into eight

00:59:52.981 --> 00:59:55.174
and fill the space around.

00:59:55.174 --> 00:59:57.231
"My apologies, have a seat."

00:59:58.318 --> 01:00:01.971
TRAVIS: Just to let you know, I tapped your painting.

01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:03.081
MATT: "I'm very aware."

01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:06.041
TRAVIS: Oh, apologies, I had never seen

01:00:06.041 --> 01:00:08.152
an interactive piece of art before.

01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:09.374
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:11.811
MATT: "Well, I hope it was enlightening."

01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:14.103
TRAVIS: It was.
LIAM: (clears throat)

01:00:14.103 --> 01:00:15.201
LAURA: Is he okay?

01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:18.032
MATT: "He'll be fine. He's had far worse.

01:00:19.261 --> 01:00:21.844
"Anyway, so..."

01:00:21.844 --> 01:00:25.548
And you watch as she tilts her fingers a bit

01:00:25.548 --> 01:00:27.732
and one of the chairs (creak)

01:00:27.732 --> 01:00:29.441
grinds out from the table right behind her,

01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:31.801
and she sits in it, crosses one leg over the other

01:00:31.801 --> 01:00:34.651
and rests her arms at edge of her knee.

01:00:34.651 --> 01:00:37.891
"To what do I owe the pleasure of you coming by

01:00:37.891 --> 01:00:39.783
"earlier than our destined meeting?"

01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:46.501
MARISHA: Well, (clears throat)

01:00:46.501 --> 01:00:51.501
we think we should accelerate our plans to leave.

01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:54.819
MATT: "For what reason?"

01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:58.391
MARISHA: We have on pretty good authority

01:00:58.391 --> 01:01:01.404
that we're not the only group heading north.

01:01:02.431 --> 01:01:07.301
MATT: "Oh, that is very true. There
are many interests up there.

01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:08.601
"And there are others who are also seeking

01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:11.511
"the secrets of this excavation?

01:01:11.511 --> 01:01:14.081
"I believe I said as much last time we spoke?"

01:01:14.081 --> 01:01:17.814
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, but potentially a group--

01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:23.211
maybe a rival group.

01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:25.170
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm just going to--

01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:27.009
MARISHA: Yeah, go, go.
TALIESIN: -- say it.

01:01:27.009 --> 01:01:30.329
Does the name The Tomb Takers ring a bell?

01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:35.651
MATT: "Sounds somewhat familiar."

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:37.711
SAM: Insight check!
TRAVIS: Everybody!

01:01:37.711 --> 01:01:40.096
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check, yeah.

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.641
LAURA: Ah! We're all, like, staring at her.

01:01:41.641 --> 01:01:42.573
MATT: Well, yeah.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:44.116
LAURA: Leaning across the tea table.

01:01:44.116 --> 01:01:45.982
LIAM: Sure.
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it, because why not?

01:01:45.982 --> 01:01:47.648
(laughter)

01:01:47.648 --> 01:01:48.713
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:01:48.713 --> 01:01:49.896
SAM: 20.
TALIESIN: 20.

01:01:49.896 --> 01:01:51.658
MARISHA: 26.
SAM: Ooh.

01:01:51.658 --> 01:01:52.683
LIAM: 26.

01:01:52.683 --> 01:01:53.516
LAURA: Whoa!

01:01:53.516 --> 01:01:55.036
Low.

01:01:55.036 --> 01:01:56.111
TRAVIS: 19!

01:01:56.111 --> 01:01:57.101
MATT: Nice!

01:01:57.101 --> 01:01:58.411
ASHLEY: You should go ahead and give me a whisper

01:01:58.411 --> 01:01:59.810
because I rolled a 12.

01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:02.135
(laughter)

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.696
TRAVIS: That's as high as it gets.

01:02:05.371 --> 01:02:09.811
MATT: So for Caleb and Beauregard, I mean,

01:02:09.811 --> 01:02:14.278
you do see a hint of recognition in her eyes and

01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:20.841
you see her think for a minute. The eyes

01:02:20.841 --> 01:02:25.824
kind of dart back and forth slightly

01:02:25.824 --> 01:02:29.666
before her expression becomes more of a calm smile.

01:02:31.611 --> 01:02:34.919
She's processing information in an instant.

01:02:36.201 --> 01:02:41.201
"That is indeed familiar. It is one of many

01:02:41.913 --> 01:02:46.913
"groups I have hired in the past to aid in some of my work.

01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:49.614
"Is this a rival group of yours?"

01:02:50.513 --> 01:02:51.496
TALIESIN: Complicated.

01:02:52.461 --> 01:02:53.631
MARISHA: An acquaintance.

01:02:53.631 --> 01:02:56.001
LIAM: Yeah, little bit of path crossing.

01:02:56.001 --> 01:02:59.261
Do you remember what the work was that you hired them for?

01:02:59.261 --> 01:03:04.111
MATT: "Well, I hired them for a couple of specific things.

01:03:04.111 --> 01:03:09.111
"One of which was a slight trip to an exterior space

01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:12.394
"in Molaesmyr, where I met them in Shadycreek.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.921
"They were bodyguards of mine

01:03:17.921 --> 01:03:20.601
"as we went to dangerous spaces.

01:03:20.601 --> 01:03:24.131
"It is important to make sure that when you're traveling

01:03:24.131 --> 01:03:26.124
"to not travel alone in such places.

01:03:27.281 --> 01:03:29.911
"But mainly just that bit of work.

01:03:29.911 --> 01:03:34.911
"We've only done maybe two excursions."

01:03:36.081 --> 01:03:37.414
TRAVIS: No current employment?

01:03:38.531 --> 01:03:41.222
MATT: "Of them? No, I have not
seen them in a number of years.

01:03:41.222 --> 01:03:43.109
LAURA: Why'd you stop working together then?

01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:45.048
Just out of curiosity.

01:03:45.048 --> 01:03:47.031
SAM: Number of years, you said?

01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:48.221
MATT: "Yeah."

01:03:48.221 --> 01:03:50.225
SAM: Among them did they have

01:03:50.225 --> 01:03:54.664
a purple-skinned fellow with horns?

01:03:55.511 --> 01:03:58.221
MATT: "They had one member who was a tiefling

01:03:58.221 --> 01:04:00.951
"that matches the description you're giving, yes.

01:04:00.951 --> 01:04:03.231
"So you do know this these people?"

01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:06.144
MARISHA: Why did you stop working with them?
SAM: Just some.

01:04:06.144 --> 01:04:09.631
MATT: "When the contract is done,
you do not <i>have</i> to hire them

01:04:09.631 --> 01:04:12.541
"and when certain individuals after a couple of jobs

01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:13.802
"seem to be..."

01:04:15.371 --> 01:04:16.561
MARISHA: Problematic?

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:18.371
MATT: "Less than trustworthy,

01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:21.101
"difficult when it comes to staying focused on the job

01:04:21.101 --> 01:04:23.941
"in front of them, when they are hired help,

01:04:23.941 --> 01:04:25.021
"then you move on."

01:04:25.021 --> 01:04:27.294
LAURA: Did the purple guy have Irish accent?

01:04:28.744 --> 01:04:29.785
TRAVIS: What's that?
SAM: Or, like, a sort of

01:04:29.785 --> 01:04:33.810
a vague Irish accent, hard to place?

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:36.372
TRAVIS: Hit or miss, come and goes?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.883
TALIESIN: I thought we got this all out of our system

01:04:37.883 --> 01:04:39.083
before the camera was rolling.

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:40.333
(laughter)

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:43.734
I really felt like we had all just gotten everything out,

01:04:43.734 --> 01:04:46.061
before all this started.

01:04:46.061 --> 01:04:48.736
SAM: Like an American accent, but who had a relative--

01:04:48.736 --> 01:04:50.444
or who had spent some time in Ireland.

01:04:50.444 --> 01:04:51.407
LIAM: Hello, Taliesin.

01:04:51.407 --> 01:04:52.852
TRAVIS: Or had just drank a bunch of Guinness.

01:04:52.852 --> 01:04:54.531
LIAM: We're are your friends. We've met.

01:04:54.531 --> 01:04:56.561
(laughter)

01:04:56.561 --> 01:04:58.359
TALIESIN: I thought I'd given everyone an opportunity to

01:04:58.359 --> 01:05:00.951
really, really use all their best material.

01:05:00.951 --> 01:05:03.404
LIAM: No, I think we only got about 60% out.

01:05:03.404 --> 01:05:04.505
(laughter)

01:05:04.505 --> 01:05:05.613
MARISHA: Never ending well.

01:05:10.551 --> 01:05:12.721
TALIESIN: How much skin is she showing right now?

01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:15.788
If she if she had tattoos, would we be able to see them?

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:20.151
MATT: Mainly just the neck, the clavicle, and hands,

01:05:20.151 --> 01:05:21.311
and you can see a bit of the ankles,

01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:24.871
but most everything else is covered with casual robes.

01:05:24.871 --> 01:05:27.091
TALIESIN: Are there any tattoos?

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:27.924
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.722
TALIESIN: I'm making a perception check.

01:05:30.722 --> 01:05:31.871
SAM: As he perceives--

01:05:31.871 --> 01:05:34.004
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) 12.

01:05:34.004 --> 01:05:35.101
MATT: 12.

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:37.541
Not from any you could see. There aren't any markings

01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:42.541
or anything that signifies any sort of permanent markings

01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:45.869
in the body other than--

01:05:45.869 --> 01:05:48.761
I mean, her makeup is flawless.

01:05:53.221 --> 01:05:56.571
TALIESIN: Did this group-- they proved untrustworthy.

01:05:56.571 --> 01:05:58.734
Did they steal anything from you,

01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:02.631
take anything, try and steal anything from you?

01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:06.891
MATT: "They were a bit dodgy about the circumstances

01:06:06.891 --> 01:06:11.891
"of our agreement and when it came to a conclusion

01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:15.961
"of the work in which we had agreed to do,

01:06:15.961 --> 01:06:20.395
"I decided it was best to find individuals that weren't so--

01:06:20.395 --> 01:06:22.626
"heh, pardon the pun of where I found them:

01:06:22.626 --> 01:06:24.551
"shady.

01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:26.741
"There are there are individuals I've found

01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:31.741
"since that have more of loyalty
to the ideals of the Empire.

01:06:32.791 --> 01:06:36.251
"I found it is challenging to work with those--

01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:37.991
"you would think, at first, who have

01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:42.991
"no particular political aspirations or connection

01:06:43.151 --> 01:06:45.981
"that they could be driven-- agree to do things

01:06:45.981 --> 01:06:50.664
"that would be a bit uncouth, but

01:06:50.664 --> 01:06:51.755
"I don't know.

01:06:51.755 --> 01:06:54.721
"Ambition can be difficult when you are paying people

01:06:54.721 --> 01:06:58.941
"to be unambitious."

01:06:58.941 --> 01:07:00.316
TALIESIN: I get that.

01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:04.553
Did any of them have any tattoos

01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:10.831
or maybe the purple tiefling?

01:07:10.831 --> 01:07:13.371
SAM: The purple one, did you know his name?

01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:17.209
MATT: "I believe his name was Lucien."

01:07:20.368 --> 01:07:23.461
TALIESIN: Did he or any of the others
have tattoos at the time?

01:07:23.461 --> 01:07:26.206
MATT: "I mean, a few of them had a number of small bits

01:07:26.206 --> 01:07:27.997
"of ink on their bodies, yes."

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:32.041
LIAM: Sounds like water under the bridge for you, though?

01:07:32.041 --> 01:07:34.581
MATT: "For me, yes, I've not seen them in quite some time

01:07:34.581 --> 01:07:38.094
"and while it did not end well,

01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:42.311
"it wasn't with any sort of lingering malice.

01:07:42.311 --> 01:07:44.681
"I just didn't like the way they did their work."

01:07:44.681 --> 01:07:47.091
MARISHA: You mentioned them being distracted

01:07:47.091 --> 01:07:48.951
and having other ambitions.

01:07:48.951 --> 01:07:53.089
Do you know with what they were distracted?

01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:59.701
MATT: "It's hard to say. They were keen to raise prices

01:08:00.331 --> 01:08:03.834
"of their acquired skills mid-contract.

01:08:04.741 --> 01:08:09.571
"They were discovering and pocketing things on expeditions

01:08:09.571 --> 01:08:11.631
"without notifying me, when the contract stated

01:08:11.631 --> 01:08:14.821
"that I was to pass out whatever we found,

01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:19.261
"and I just got the sense that, were this relationship

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:23.781
"to continue over time, that they wished to shift

01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:27.971
"the dynamic of power

01:08:27.971 --> 01:08:31.331
"and that does not behoove my interests

01:08:31.331 --> 01:08:34.391
"so we went our separate ways."

01:08:34.391 --> 01:08:36.171
TRAVIS: Did you send them up to Eiselcross

01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:38.676
for any of your prior arrangements?

01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:43.711
MATT: "One of these excursions was to the north, yes."

01:08:43.711 --> 01:08:45.701
TRAVIS: And is there anything that they would be able

01:08:45.701 --> 01:08:49.174
to use from your former contracts?

01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:51.111
Any knowledge about what your pursuits might be

01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:53.131
that they would then want to leverage against you

01:08:53.131 --> 01:08:57.407
in some sort of way? Privileged information, perhaps?

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:03.666
MATT: "I do not think so, they are not-- hmm.

01:09:05.561 --> 01:09:07.947
"They're not as well-learned as I am.

01:09:08.901 --> 01:09:10.191
"And there is confidence in knowing

01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:13.461
"that perhaps some of the mysteries that we have come across

01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:16.426
"beforehand are a bit beyond their capabilities.

01:09:18.031 --> 01:09:19.801
"I have to ask, as you've--

01:09:19.801 --> 01:09:24.694
"This is a very curious line of conversation.

01:09:25.681 --> 01:09:27.391
"You know a lot about these individuals.

01:09:27.391 --> 01:09:28.971
"What is your history with them?

01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:32.461
"And your concern, if indeed this is the group

01:09:32.461 --> 01:09:34.594
"of which you say we are up against?"

01:09:37.751 --> 01:09:39.341
LIAM: We know they are going to be in the area.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.541
I wouldn't say that we're going to be

01:09:40.541 --> 01:09:42.261
up against them, per se.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:47.252
We have had some dealings with this Lucien in the past.

01:09:47.252 --> 01:09:49.068
We have had some dealings with this Lucien in the past.

01:09:52.011 --> 01:09:56.991
He was unreliable, strange

01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:01.791
and left many questions with us to ponder.

01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:05.351
So we were surprised to find out

01:10:05.351 --> 01:10:09.331
that they would be joining us in the north.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:12.601
SAM: And, forgive us, we've also been sent into situations

01:10:12.601 --> 01:10:15.141
before without all the the facts

01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:19.624
and sort of been sprung upon and surprised

01:10:19.624 --> 01:10:20.465
and sort of been sprung upon and surprised

01:10:20.465 --> 01:10:21.714
and so we just wanted to make sure

01:10:21.714 --> 01:10:24.927
that you weren't sending us into a situation

01:10:24.927 --> 01:10:26.861
without all of the facts.

01:10:26.861 --> 01:10:28.781
MATT: "Of course, and I'm appreciative of you

01:10:28.781 --> 01:10:30.194
"notifying me of this.

01:10:31.151 --> 01:10:34.651
"If indeed we are to be on similar paths,

01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:37.987
"it is good to be careful."

01:10:43.321 --> 01:10:45.761
SAM: But you're not worried about these other groups

01:10:45.761 --> 01:10:48.426
and parties that might be up there searching?

01:10:48.426 --> 01:10:52.391
If we told you that they're up there currently,

01:10:52.391 --> 01:10:55.151
where our destination is, wouldn't you want to pack up

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:58.151
and go right away, or they can't possibly find

01:10:58.151 --> 01:11:00.434
what you're going to find? Doesn't worry you?

01:11:04.831 --> 01:11:08.717
MATT: "In my experience with the Tomb Takers, they are--

01:11:08.717 --> 01:11:11.704
"they are skilled at a handful of things.

01:11:12.971 --> 01:11:16.861
"None of those skills seem to fall into understanding

01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:21.861
"the depth of the mysteries that wait for us up north."

01:11:22.971 --> 01:11:24.851
TALIESIN: What if they've changed?

01:11:24.851 --> 01:11:27.471
LAURA: What if they've gotten new knowledge?

01:11:27.471 --> 01:11:29.451
MATT: "Well, if they've allied themselves with individuals

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.813
"who perhaps could aid them in this,

01:11:31.813 --> 01:11:36.112
"then haste is something we should consider."

01:11:36.112 --> 01:11:39.226
MARISHA: I don't know if I would write off

01:11:39.226 --> 01:11:42.794
ignorance for blind ambition.

01:11:50.311 --> 01:11:54.664
MATT: "It's hard to put your mind at ease

01:11:54.664 --> 01:11:58.079
"until you see where it is we are going.

01:11:58.971 --> 01:12:01.581
"But even the time that I spent with them,

01:12:01.581 --> 01:12:04.571
"it is but the very tip of the iceberg."

01:12:06.661 --> 01:12:11.661
TRAVIS: Where we're going, is it trapped?

01:12:11.711 --> 01:12:16.653
Things that are laid out to deter unknowledgeable folks?

01:12:16.653 --> 01:12:18.153
Things that are laid out to deter unknowledgeable folks?

01:12:19.121 --> 01:12:20.779
MATT: "Trap, eh.

01:12:20.779 --> 01:12:25.037
"The word "trap" insinuates that they were placed

01:12:25.037 --> 01:12:30.031
"specifically to entice and destroy.

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:34.631
"There are no traps, if you will.

01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:39.631
"There are malfunctioning remnants."

01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:40.708
"There are malfunctioning remnants."

01:12:40.708 --> 01:12:42.479
TRAVIS: Perilous features?

01:12:42.479 --> 01:12:45.687
MATT: "Numerous,

01:12:45.687 --> 01:12:49.212
"but this is why I've chosen <i>you</i> to accompany me,

01:12:49.212 --> 01:12:52.521
"as I've had not as much luck with individuals in the past,

01:12:52.521 --> 01:12:54.264
"such as these Tomb Takers.

01:12:55.391 --> 01:12:57.611
"You've proven yourself very capable

01:12:57.611 --> 01:13:01.474
"and of aligned interests here in the Empire.

01:13:01.474 --> 01:13:02.888
"So.

01:13:02.888 --> 01:13:05.861
"Based on the recommendations that have been given to me,

01:13:05.861 --> 01:13:07.186
"and what you're capable of,

01:13:07.186 --> 01:13:11.983
"I feel very confident in our ability to

01:13:11.983 --> 01:13:16.221
"delve deeper than anyone else has before in my presence."

01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:20.701
MARISHA: What if we told you
that the Tomb Takers were working

01:13:20.701 --> 01:13:22.241
with the Dynasty?

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:26.177
MATT: "In what way?"

01:13:27.681 --> 01:13:29.431
MARISHA: In the same way that you hired us:

01:13:30.431 --> 01:13:34.541
to chase down whatever it is you're not telling us about.

01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:36.111
You think they can't do the same thing,

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:37.911
hire their own group of mercenaries?

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:42.864
MATT: "Well--"
MARISHA: You said so yourself:

01:13:42.864 --> 01:13:45.536
your biggest fear

01:13:45.536 --> 01:13:47.091
is that this knowledge and technology

01:13:47.091 --> 01:13:49.091
will fall into the hands of the Dynasty.

01:13:51.981 --> 01:13:54.884
MATT: "I mean, it is very much a concern,

01:13:54.884 --> 01:13:56.686
"but given my previous experience,

01:13:56.686 --> 01:14:01.321
"woe unto whatever poor soul decides to trust them again.

01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:05.471
"But, I agree, with the knowledge they themselves,

01:14:05.471 --> 01:14:07.361
"if indeed you are confident in this,

01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:09.721
"are heading towards a similar goal as us,

01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:12.636
"then perhaps we should leave much sooner."

01:14:13.631 --> 01:14:15.081
LIAM: Certainly couldn't hurt.

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.016
MATT: "How much time do you need?

01:14:18.016 --> 01:14:19.710
"I can be ready by tonight."

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:21.181
LAURA: Whoa.

01:14:21.181 --> 01:14:22.844
TRAVIS: Tomorrow, I think, would be fine.

01:14:22.844 --> 01:14:26.590
SAM: We need a couple more days for our armor and stuff.

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:30.102
TRAVIS: Tomorrow morning sounds good.
TALIESIN: I have to wait for equipment

01:14:30.102 --> 01:14:32.734
MARISHA: Yeah, we got to check in on--

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.962
LAURA: So, like, hurry it up and then wait a little bit.

01:14:34.962 --> 01:14:38.227
We'll let you now, maybe a couple more days.

01:14:38.227 --> 01:14:39.852
SAM: A couple days, a couple of days.

01:14:39.852 --> 01:14:42.189
TRAVIS: Be here at 6:00am, first shot up at 11:30.

01:14:42.189 --> 01:14:44.771
MATT: "So this knowledge of these Tomb Takers is worrisome,

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:46.483
"but, like, only somewhat worrisome?"

01:14:46.483 --> 01:14:47.666
SAM: No, no, no.

01:14:47.666 --> 01:14:50.381
MARISHA: We want to be prepared the best that we can be

01:14:50.381 --> 01:14:54.941
in order to serve you to the best of our abilities.

01:14:54.941 --> 01:14:57.981
And we are getting a lot of equipment upgraded,

01:14:57.981 --> 01:15:01.739
so I don't think you want us to go in weakend, right?

01:15:01.739 --> 01:15:02.797
LAURA: What if I send a message

01:15:02.797 --> 01:15:06.144
and just see how fast they can do the armor?

01:15:07.021 --> 01:15:10.941
Maybe we can leave tomorrow, depending. I'll send a message.

01:15:10.941 --> 01:15:13.116
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send a message.

01:15:13.116 --> 01:15:18.104
SAM: Also, Vess, you know much about magic and sorcery,

01:15:18.104 --> 01:15:19.728
SAM: Also, Vess, you know much about magic and sorcery,

01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:21.591
have you ever heard of a spell

01:15:21.591 --> 01:15:23.411
that could make nine women

01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:27.911
have one baby after just 30 day, 28 days or so.

01:15:27.911 --> 01:15:29.201
Have you ever heard of such a thing?

01:15:29.201 --> 01:15:30.951
LIAM: Well, that's a 9th-level spell.

01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:35.425
TALIESIN: 9th-level [inaudible].

01:15:35.425 --> 01:15:37.581
(laughter)

01:15:37.581 --> 01:15:38.471
MATT: "It's a curious question,

01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:39.859
"I don't have anything specifically,

01:15:39.859 --> 01:15:42.914
"but it is not beyond the realm of possibility."

01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:45.363
(laughter)

01:15:45.363 --> 01:15:48.054
SAM: I'll work on it.
TALIESIN: Magic doesn't count.

01:15:48.054 --> 01:15:51.244
LIAM: That's what the study
and laboratory is for in my tower.

01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:55.431
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Pumat.

01:15:55.431 --> 01:15:58.741
Hi, if we need to leave super fast,

01:15:58.741 --> 01:16:01.471
how quick could you get Caduceus' armor done?

01:16:01.471 --> 01:16:03.951
Like, a day?

01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:05.315
How much would it be?

01:16:05.315 --> 01:16:06.851
SAM: And my flask!

01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:08.576
LAURA: And flask.

01:16:08.576 --> 01:16:11.868
LIAM: I just smile awkwardly at DeRogna
while she talks to the air.

01:16:15.096 --> 01:16:17.001
MATT: (as Pumat) "That's a tall order there!

01:16:17.001 --> 01:16:20.782
"It's not like I can just rush it, you know.

01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:24.423
"Things take time, sorry."

01:16:24.423 --> 01:16:25.256
SAM: Jesus.

01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:28.509
LAURA: He's not being very helpful;
he says things take time.

01:16:28.509 --> 01:16:30.801
TALIESIN: I have a funny feeling this things are just--

01:16:30.801 --> 01:16:32.426
LAURA: They take time.

01:16:32.426 --> 01:16:34.121
SAM: Or we could just skip the armor and go.

01:16:34.121 --> 01:16:35.511
TRAVIS: We should threaten him.

01:16:35.511 --> 01:16:38.161
Threaten Pumat.
TALIESIN: Big difference in my reality.

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:39.827
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: You'll be fine.

01:16:39.827 --> 01:16:41.691
ASHLEY: The armor will be ready then, when?

01:16:41.691 --> 01:16:42.841
TALIESIN: 48 hours.

01:16:42.841 --> 01:16:44.331
ASHLEY: 48 hours.

01:16:44.331 --> 01:16:47.741
LIAM: (Pumat voice) You can't take
nine Pumats and make a breastplate.

01:16:47.741 --> 01:16:48.574
TALIESIN: Exactly.

01:16:50.422 --> 01:16:52.601
It is a five point drop in my AC, so.

01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:53.521
ASHLEY: I feel like we need.

01:16:53.521 --> 01:16:54.981
TRAVIS: It's a <i>five</i> point drop?

01:16:54.981 --> 01:16:56.071
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:16:56.071 --> 01:16:57.488
LAURA: Wow.

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:58.621
TRAVIS: <i>Oh.</i>

01:16:58.621 --> 01:17:01.666
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a reason I did this.

01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:03.101
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I was going to give you my armor,

01:17:03.101 --> 01:17:04.503
but that's not nearly five points.

01:17:04.503 --> 01:17:05.486
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

01:17:05.486 --> 01:17:08.643
LIAM: I think we should get the armor;
you're our only healer.

01:17:08.643 --> 01:17:12.044
SAM: (laughs) The salt!

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:15.201
LAURA: It's true, it's true, Caduceus.

01:17:15.201 --> 01:17:16.521
MARISHA: Well, maybe we can go down there

01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:19.894
and maybe a little bit of money will change his mind.

01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:24.381
MATT: "Is there a problem with this commission you made?"

01:17:25.531 --> 01:17:28.831
TALIESIN: Just going to take a couple days,
that's all, 48 hours.

01:17:28.831 --> 01:17:31.576
MARISHA: They're just a little bit slow,
you know what I mean?

01:17:31.576 --> 01:17:33.144
MATT: "Well, who have you commissioned for this?"

01:17:34.211 --> 01:17:39.211
MARISHA: Pumat Sol, from the Invulnerable Vagrant.

01:17:39.211 --> 01:17:41.461
LIAM: Yeah, she's familiar.

01:17:42.482 --> 01:17:44.298
LAURA: Have you worked with him?

01:17:44.298 --> 01:17:46.051
MATT: "On a couple of occasions, yes.

01:17:46.051 --> 01:17:51.044
"He does quite a bit of work for the Cerberus Assembly.

01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:56.173
"I will speak to him, see if I can expedite this process."

01:17:56.173 --> 01:17:58.744
TRAVIS: Yo, Pumat's dead.

01:17:58.744 --> 01:18:00.101
LAURA: Wait, be nice to him, though, okay,

01:18:00.101 --> 01:18:01.901
because he's been really nice to us.

01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:04.172
MATT: "Of course."

01:18:04.172 --> 01:18:05.172
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:08.744
TRAVIS: Uh oh.
MARISHA: So by tomorrow?

01:18:11.311 --> 01:18:13.341
MATT: "Well, based I do not quite know exactly

01:18:13.341 --> 01:18:15.911
"what it is he's working on for you, but if I inquire,

01:18:15.911 --> 01:18:17.481
"I will have some better information,

01:18:17.481 --> 01:18:19.694
"and perhaps a means of expediting this."

01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:22.412
TRAVIS: Excellent.
TALIESIN: All right.

01:18:22.412 --> 01:18:24.851
TRAVIS: Great news, good chat.

01:18:24.851 --> 01:18:27.591
Watch out for the bat thing that flew before.

01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:30.826
I don't really know where it went.

01:18:30.826 --> 01:18:32.109
MATT: "I will keep an eye out.

01:18:32.109 --> 01:18:34.261
"Let me know when you're ready to leave."

01:18:34.261 --> 01:18:36.099
LAURA: Yeah, we'll send you a message.

01:18:36.099 --> 01:18:38.041
MATT: "I will prepare my things."

01:18:38.041 --> 01:18:39.157
LAURA: Okay.

01:18:39.157 --> 01:18:40.601
MATT: "Farewell."
SAM: Bye!

01:18:40.601 --> 01:18:42.270
LAURA: What's wrong, Caduceus?

01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:43.311
TALIESIN: Oh, nothing, nothing.

01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:45.274
LAURA: You were making a face like something was very wrong.

01:18:45.274 --> 01:18:48.121
TALIESIN: I just hope we didn't get
Pumat in trouble, that's all.

01:18:48.121 --> 01:18:49.611
TRAVIS: We definitely did.

01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:52.169
TALIESIN: I'm going to feel a little guilty for a minute.

01:18:55.621 --> 01:18:58.588
MATT: The door opens and it allows you guys to

01:18:58.588 --> 01:19:00.751
leave the tower and go about the rest of your business

01:19:00.751 --> 01:19:04.444
in preparation for your expedited excursion to the north.

01:19:05.531 --> 01:19:07.476
MATT: So?
SAM: To Zadash?

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:08.421
MARISHA: Wow, okay.

01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:10.066
LAURA: Quickly.

01:19:10.066 --> 01:19:11.189
MARISHA: To Zadash.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.031
Yeah?
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:19:14.031 --> 01:19:15.273
There's nothing else to do here.

01:19:15.273 --> 01:19:16.705
LIAM: I lead us straight to an alleyway

01:19:16.705 --> 01:19:18.471
so I can stop drawing on the ground.

01:19:19.534 --> 01:19:20.434
TRAVIS: It's awesome.

01:19:20.434 --> 01:19:25.434
MARISHA: Can you do the thing, or you tapped?
LAURA: Oh man, I'm using all my spells today.

01:19:25.684 --> 01:19:29.611
Brrs-- yep. I'm going to send the message to who?

01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:31.046
MARISHA: Zeenoth should be fine.

01:19:31.046 --> 01:19:32.748
LAURA: Then I'm going to send a message to Zeenoth.

01:19:32.748 --> 01:19:34.371
MATT: All righty!

01:19:34.371 --> 01:19:36.851
LAURA: Guess what, we're traveling again!

01:19:36.851 --> 01:19:38.381
We're on our way to you now.

01:19:38.381 --> 01:19:40.751
So be prepared because we're coming through.

01:19:40.751 --> 01:19:43.715
By the way, this is Beau and the Mighty Nein.

01:19:43.715 --> 01:19:45.021
MARISHA: Yeah!
TRAVIS: This is Beau.

01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:46.449
LAURA: Hmm. Well.

01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:49.796
MATT: "Curious.

01:19:49.796 --> 01:19:52.404
"Well, I will make preparations for your arrival.

01:19:53.431 --> 01:19:56.381
"Coming through quite a bit recently!

01:19:56.381 --> 01:20:00.370
"It's nice. It's been a bit dull."

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:01.620
That's it.

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.438
LAURA: I think Zeenoth likes you.

01:20:04.438 --> 01:20:07.891
MARISHA: Oh, I thought-- Maybe he likes you.

01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:10.121
LAURA: Well, I haven't really talked to him.

01:20:10.121 --> 01:20:11.561
I let him know it was <i>you</i> coming through.

01:20:11.561 --> 01:20:14.931
SAM: Is there a love triangle going on?

01:20:14.931 --> 01:20:16.606
MARISHA: Zeenoth hates me.

01:20:16.606 --> 01:20:18.047
SAM: I don't know!
LAURA: I think maybe he likes you

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:20.597
more than you know.
SAM: Maybe it's, like, love-hate?

01:20:20.597 --> 01:20:23.361
MARISHA: Maybe it's love-hate, we do bring the party.

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:26.192
I mean, it's pretty great.

01:20:27.711 --> 01:20:30.448
MATT: All right, you find an alleyway.

01:20:30.448 --> 01:20:33.153
LIAM: ♪ Do the double dutch, do the double dutch ♪

01:20:35.511 --> 01:20:37.811
MATT: You all transport immediately to the basement

01:20:37.811 --> 01:20:41.591
beneath the archive of Zadash.

01:20:41.591 --> 01:20:43.141
As you make your way up, Zeenoth is there waiting

01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:46.564
with a couple of archivists as well.

01:20:48.191 --> 01:20:51.801
"Welcome again. I take it to you're not here

01:20:51.801 --> 01:20:56.368
"to do any more research or are you just using us as a means

01:20:56.368 --> 01:20:58.303

LIAM: Just passing through.

01:20:58.303 --> 01:21:01.751
MARISHA: Thanks, man! Bye!

01:21:01.751 --> 01:21:05.167
LAURA: I high five on the way up. Yeah!

01:21:05.167 --> 01:21:08.271
MATT: He instinctively responds and goes, "Mmm."

01:21:08.271 --> 01:21:10.588
MARISHA: I turn around and I go: You like it.

01:21:12.917 --> 01:21:15.151
MATT: And he just stares back.

01:21:17.274 --> 01:21:20.581
LAURA: ♪ Traci's back! Back again! ♪

MATT: At this point, you guys are--

01:21:25.889 --> 01:21:27.599
TRAVIS: You have no hair. It's all tied.

01:21:27.599 --> 01:21:29.049
MARISHA: Yeah, it's all slicked back.

01:21:31.031 --> 01:21:35.371
MATT: You guys are pretty on the level
when it comes to authority

01:21:35.371 --> 01:21:39.091
within the overall Cobalt Soul. So whereas previously

01:21:39.091 --> 01:21:41.351
he was very much your senior, now you're on

01:21:41.351 --> 01:21:43.214
an even playing field,

01:21:44.331 --> 01:21:46.609
and with that his demeanor has shifted slightly.

01:21:46.609 --> 01:21:47.871
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:51.134
MATT: But nevertheless, the city of Zadash is yours.

01:21:52.191 --> 01:21:56.671
At this point in time, it is evening.

01:21:56.671 --> 01:21:58.693
What would you like to do here in Zadash?

01:21:58.693 --> 01:22:01.461
LAURA: Ooh, we get to see the kitty cats again!

01:22:01.461 --> 01:22:03.601
LIAM: We do not get to see the kitty cats tonight.

01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:08.024
I have used my greatest to get us to Molly's

01:22:10.131 --> 01:22:11.421
LAURA: That's totally fine.

01:22:11.421 --> 01:22:14.271
LIAM: So we're going to have to stay in an inn.

01:22:14.271 --> 01:22:19.271
TRAVIS: Oh god, roughing it! I hate it, never go back.

01:22:19.395 --> 01:22:21.271
MARISHA: The mirror can wait.

01:22:21.271 --> 01:22:25.195
TALIESIN: Let's enjoy a warm place to sleep while we can.

01:22:25.195 --> 01:22:26.512

LIAM: Hub and son?

01:22:33.671 --> 01:22:38.666
SAM: Yeah, which I'm looking up what it's called right now.

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:43.554
LIAM: It's the Best Western, I think.

01:22:43.554 --> 01:22:46.061

SAM: They went to The Bottle and Cork, The Rusty Rudder,

01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:58.087
The Crass Sailor, they went to--

01:22:58.087 --> 01:22:59.963
TRAVIS: The Rusty Trombone.

01:22:59.963 --> 01:23:02.581
MARISHA: Are you just making up tavern names?
They're pretty good.

01:23:02.581 --> 01:23:04.643
Leaky Tap? No, that's--

01:23:04.643 --> 01:23:07.285
SAM: Those are two bars in Rehoboth Beach.

01:23:08.731 --> 01:23:12.906
MARISHA: Like this-- wasn't it the fancy one in the Spire?

01:23:12.906 --> 01:23:14.190
SAM: I can't even find my page that says Zadash on it.

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:16.151
MARISHA: I think they're at the fancy one, huh?

01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:17.041
TRAVIS: Pillow Trove?

01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:18.132
LAURA: Pillow Trove.

01:23:18.132 --> 01:23:21.265
MARISHA: No, it wasn't that fancy.
LIAM: This is what I chose Keen Mind for.

01:23:21.265 --> 01:23:23.181
Where did we stay, Matt?

01:23:23.181 --> 01:23:24.371
MATT: 30 days.

LIAM: 30 days?

01:23:25.279 --> 01:23:26.879
Didn't we just leave them here a few days ago?

01:23:26.879 --> 01:23:28.611
MATT: You did, you did.

01:23:28.611 --> 01:23:30.001
SAM: It was not the Pillow Tro--

01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:31.181
It might've been the Pillow Trove.

01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:32.719
MATT: Pillow Trove is more expensive place.

01:23:32.719 --> 01:23:35.381
MARISHA: I feel like it was a place where the hipsters

01:23:35.381 --> 01:23:36.261
would stay.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.801
SAM: Song and Supper?

01:23:37.801 --> 01:23:38.634
MARISHA: No.

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:40.572
LIAM: Fuddruckers.

01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:42.061
MARISHA: Didn't have a "son" in the name.

01:23:42.061 --> 01:23:44.934
TRAVIS: Love Fuddruckers. It had altered beasts.

01:23:46.552 --> 01:23:48.727
SAM: Gilded Willows. Nope.

01:23:48.727 --> 01:23:51.218
MARISHA: Where did we leave your family?

01:23:51.218 --> 01:23:53.031
Oh no!
MATT: It could've been the Lodge of the Eclipse.

01:23:53.031 --> 01:23:54.577
I don't remember which place you sent them at.

01:23:54.577 --> 01:23:56.549
SAM: Chastity's Nook. Nope.

01:23:56.549 --> 01:23:57.838
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait!

01:23:57.838 --> 01:23:59.281
(laughter)

01:23:59.281 --> 01:24:00.421
No, no.

01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:01.541
SAM: Steam's Respite.

01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:02.781
MARISHA: Nope, that's a bath house.

01:24:02.781 --> 01:24:03.941
SAM: Pillow Trove! Nope.

01:24:03.941 --> 01:24:04.774
LIAM: This is great.

01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:06.568
LAURA: It wasn't the Pillow Trove?

01:24:06.568 --> 01:24:08.531
I think you sent them to the Pillow Trove.

01:24:08.531 --> 01:24:09.971
SAM: King's Hail Board!

01:24:09.971 --> 01:24:11.413
LAURA: Because you sent them to the fancy one, right?

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:12.867
TRAVIS: Send a message.

01:24:12.867 --> 01:24:14.650
SAM: Lodge of the Eclipse! Lodge of the Eclipse!

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:16.924
It was the dinner theater.
MATT: Lodge of the Eclipse, that's right.

01:24:16.924 --> 01:24:18.357
All right.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:24:18.357 --> 01:24:19.940
MATT: That it was. Okay.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.898
All right, so you go ahead and make your way

01:24:23.898 --> 01:24:24.830
to the Lodge of the Eclipse.

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:26.927
SAM: But first we visit all the other places.

01:24:26.927 --> 01:24:30.022
MATT: Yeah, you just go on a full tour in the evening.

01:24:30.022 --> 01:24:31.344
No, when you--
LAURA: Where did we park?!

01:24:31.344 --> 01:24:32.500
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.483
MATT: When you left them at the Lodge of the Eclipse,

01:24:35.483 --> 01:24:39.861
it was like middayish at the time, not too busy.

01:24:39.861 --> 01:24:42.231
As you approach, you can already hear the music

01:24:42.231 --> 01:24:45.231
loudly in the streets here in Zadash.

01:24:45.231 --> 01:24:49.401
And as you-- not too far off. As you enter the interior,

01:24:49.401 --> 01:24:52.281
you can see it is loud, it is crowded,

01:24:52.281 --> 01:24:54.221
and there is a stage with

01:24:54.221 --> 01:24:57.913
a magnificent burlesque show being performed at the moment.

01:24:58.771 --> 01:24:59.996
SAM: Luc.

01:24:59.996 --> 01:25:02.246
(laughter)

01:25:04.573 --> 01:25:06.611
Tassles.

01:25:06.611 --> 01:25:08.605
MARISHA: This is the best!

01:25:08.605 --> 01:25:13.279
MATT: And within a short time of being within

01:25:13.279 --> 01:25:18.187
the interior of the lodge, I would say,

01:25:18.187 --> 01:25:20.591
Beauregard and Caduceus,

01:25:20.591 --> 01:25:23.761
you both see, throughout the crowd,

01:25:23.761 --> 01:25:27.519
a small person dodging and weaving between people.

01:25:27.519 --> 01:25:31.356
And within a quick moment of glancing over,
you can see it is Yeza--

01:25:31.356 --> 01:25:32.189
MARISHA: Oh, it's Yeza?

01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:36.671
MATT: Yeah, who is currently nervously searching

01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:38.504
through the crowd.

01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:42.184
MARISHA: Uh oh. I just reach out and grab him by the collar.

01:25:42.184 --> 01:25:43.017
MATT: "(surprised yelp)"

01:25:43.017 --> 01:25:44.092
MARISHA: It's just me, it's me, it's me.

01:25:44.092 --> 01:25:46.201
MATT: "Oh, you're back! Okay!"
MARISHA: Sorry, I didn't mean to be so aggressive.

01:25:46.201 --> 01:25:47.151
Are you looking for your kid?

01:25:47.151 --> 01:25:52.151
MATT: "Shh, yes, don't tell Veth. It'll be just a second."

01:25:52.161 --> 01:25:53.511
MARISHA: I think I know where he is.

01:25:53.511 --> 01:25:56.201
I start heading behind the stage.

01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:59.351
I go and start peeking behind curtains backstage.

01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:00.553
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

01:26:00.553 --> 01:26:01.553
MARISHA: All right.

01:26:03.671 --> 01:26:07.164
All right, it's okay, 23?

01:26:08.301 --> 01:26:11.641
MATT: Within a short time, you find Luc wrapped in a curtain

01:26:11.641 --> 01:26:13.431
currently peeking behind the stage.

01:26:13.431 --> 01:26:15.891
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly where I thought.

01:26:15.891 --> 01:26:17.721
MATT: So as soon as you-- you know where he is,

01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:18.801
you haven't disturbed him yet.

01:26:18.801 --> 01:26:22.795
MARISHA: I just go up and I put my head

01:26:22.795 --> 01:26:24.654
in the fold next to him.

01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:28.721
Look over at him.

01:26:30.037 --> 01:26:31.691
MATT: "(startled noise)"

01:26:31.691 --> 01:26:33.191
He runs off.

01:26:33.191 --> 01:26:34.181
MARISHA: I grab him real quick.

01:26:34.181 --> 01:26:35.671
MATT: Yeah, it's easy enough for you to grab him.

01:26:35.671 --> 01:26:37.421
MARISHA: And I drag them back over to dad.

01:26:37.421 --> 01:26:38.531
MATT: Okay.

01:26:38.531 --> 01:26:39.881
MARISHA: Found him.

01:26:39.881 --> 01:26:41.406
MATT: "Great.

01:26:41.406 --> 01:26:44.453
"Oh, hi, everyone!

01:26:44.453 --> 01:26:47.960
"I didn't know it was this kind of an establishment!"

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.251
He's trying to yell over the music and the chatter

01:26:51.251 --> 01:26:53.561
and then laughing and cheering.

01:26:53.561 --> 01:26:55.671
SAM: Have you enjoyed the show?

01:26:55.671 --> 01:26:57.261
MATT: "Sure."

01:26:57.261 --> 01:26:58.571
MARISHA: So with Luc.

01:26:58.571 --> 01:26:59.404
SAM: Oh, yeah?

01:26:59.404 --> 01:27:00.431
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

01:27:00.431 --> 01:27:04.581
MATT: "No, he's been good!"
He's holding his hand over his eyes.

01:27:04.581 --> 01:27:06.731
LAURA: There's nothing wrong with it, it's fine.

01:27:08.251 --> 01:27:09.851
MATT: "It's, he's just a little young."

01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:12.273
LAURA: Sure.

01:27:12.273 --> 01:27:14.523
(laughter)

01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:17.761
MATT: "Anyway, we're going to get back to our room.

01:27:17.761 --> 01:27:19.092
"Are you are you staying with us tonight?"

01:27:19.092 --> 01:27:22.774
SAM: Yeah, I think so. We should get a few more rooms, yeah,

01:27:22.774 --> 01:27:25.651
and then we'll we'll shack up.

01:27:25.651 --> 01:27:28.071
MARISHA: How much longer is the show going on?

01:27:28.071 --> 01:27:29.847
Is it just starting or just finishing?

01:27:29.847 --> 01:27:31.234
MATT: "I don't know."

01:27:31.234 --> 01:27:32.851
(laughter)

01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:34.444
"Come on, Luc," then he goes ahead and escorts him

01:27:34.444 --> 01:27:37.019
back up the stairs to the second floor of the inn.

01:27:39.001 --> 01:27:40.311
Yeah, you're not sure when it started,

01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:42.261
but the the energy is still carrying

01:27:42.261 --> 01:27:43.711
and it's a pretty decent show.

01:27:45.101 --> 01:27:46.461
MARISHA: I'll stay for the show.

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:47.294
MATT: You got it.

01:27:50.011 --> 01:27:51.871
So anybody else staying for the show?

01:27:51.871 --> 01:27:55.016
LIAM: No, I'm going to go do a ton of homework

01:27:55.016 --> 01:27:56.245
with some spells.

01:27:56.245 --> 01:27:57.521
MATT: Okay.

01:27:57.521 --> 01:28:01.051
LAURA: I'm going to go go back upstairs, yeah.

01:28:01.051 --> 01:28:01.884
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:28:01.884 --> 01:28:03.611
SAM: Go to sleep, maybe?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm!

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:05.831
MATT: Okay, so you're getting a couple more rooms,

01:28:05.831 --> 01:28:07.401
two, three more rooms?

01:28:07.401 --> 01:28:09.303
TALIESIN: Yeah, fit like three more rooms.

01:28:09.303 --> 01:28:11.111
MATT: Three more rooms, all right.

01:28:11.111 --> 01:28:13.621
For this establishment, then I'll put you at 100, sorry,

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:14.471
one and a half gold.

01:28:14.471 --> 01:28:15.661
TALIESIN: I got it.

01:28:15.661 --> 01:28:16.561
MATT: For the evening.

01:28:17.914 --> 01:28:19.341
But the show, the show is fun.

01:28:19.341 --> 01:28:23.311
I mean, this isn't the Pillow Trove by any means,

01:28:23.311 --> 01:28:25.201
but it is nicer than some of the other establishments

01:28:25.201 --> 01:28:26.791
here within Zadash.

01:28:26.791 --> 01:28:29.021
The central chamber of it is very much

01:28:29.021 --> 01:28:32.561
like a mess hall of a dining hall

01:28:32.561 --> 01:28:34.311
and then the stage towards the back of it

01:28:34.311 --> 01:28:37.531
is a little ramshackle with the area of space behind it,

01:28:37.531 --> 01:28:40.661
but the curtains are nice and some of the newer accoutrement

01:28:40.661 --> 01:28:43.404
in the inner space. There are some musicians off to the side

01:28:43.404 --> 01:28:46.195
playing mostly brass- and wood-based instruments,

01:28:46.195 --> 01:28:49.070
playing mostly brass- and wood-based instruments,

01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:50.961
and it gives us the body feel

01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:52.861
with some hand beat drums going,

01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:56.591
(drum rhythm).

01:28:56.591 --> 01:29:00.171
You see performances across the gender spectrum,

01:29:00.171 --> 01:29:01.661
beautiful colors and feathers,

01:29:01.661 --> 01:29:05.058
you see the equivalent of what would be a bubble dance,

01:29:05.058 --> 01:29:08.372
a classic style performance.

01:29:09.801 --> 01:29:13.591
It is tasteful artistic and just enough of a tease

01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:18.081
from set to set to keep the audience enthralled,

01:29:18.081 --> 01:29:20.107
but also right on the edge of

01:29:20.107 --> 01:29:22.981
getting a little overheated or overzealous.

01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:25.261
But you have another 40 or so minutes of the performance

01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:29.101
before it comes to a close and you feel very satisfied.

01:29:29.101 --> 01:29:31.534
MARISHA: I toss some silver pieces in the meantime.

01:29:33.555 --> 01:29:35.384
I wouldn't admit that I'm like...

01:29:36.991 --> 01:29:40.207
trying to ping them off people, but--

01:29:40.207 --> 01:29:42.133
MATT: You going to bounce a quarter off that ass?

01:29:42.133 --> 01:29:45.581
MARISHA: Maybe, maybe.
I'm not trying for it, but I'm trying for it.

01:29:45.581 --> 01:29:47.721
MATT: Fair enough.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:47.721 --> 01:29:49.584
MATT: Well, you succeed, you have
very good aim at throwing things.

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:50.717
MARISHA: I do.

01:29:50.717 --> 01:29:53.451
(laughter)

01:29:53.451 --> 01:29:54.861
LIAM: All those ball bearings.

01:29:54.861 --> 01:29:57.582
MATT: Yeah, well, except for ball bearings, maybe.

01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:03.111
All right, so anything else you'd like to accomplish

01:30:03.111 --> 01:30:04.951
before the evening comes to a close?

01:30:04.951 --> 01:30:08.232
LIAM: What time-ish did we arrive at this establishment?

01:30:09.130 --> 01:30:11.722
MATT: Um, by the time you were--

01:30:11.722 --> 01:30:14.121
By the time you had finished all your work in Rexxentrum

01:30:14.121 --> 01:30:17.401
and met with Vess, it was towards the evening.

01:30:17.401 --> 01:30:19.091
And so you got to the establishment,

01:30:19.091 --> 01:30:23.301
it's about 9:30 in the evening.

01:30:23.301 --> 01:30:26.101
LIAM: Okay, could I go till 1:30 in the morning

01:30:26.101 --> 01:30:27.811
without suffering exhaustion?

01:30:27.811 --> 01:30:29.093
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

01:30:29.093 --> 01:30:30.917
LAURA: Who's-- who's--

01:30:30.917 --> 01:30:33.067
How many rooms do we have, who's rooming with you?

01:30:33.067 --> 01:30:36.636
MATT: Four rooms total including the Brenatto family.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.233
LAURA: Okay.

01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:44.026
So I'm assuming I'm rooming with Yasha and Beau again?

01:30:45.001 --> 01:30:46.401
MATT: That's up to you.

01:30:46.401 --> 01:30:48.459
SAM: We could do two people per room.

01:30:49.884 --> 01:30:51.001
If you'd like.

01:30:52.591 --> 01:30:54.757
ASHLEY: We could do a...

01:30:55.724 --> 01:30:57.557
a ladies sleep over.

01:30:57.557 --> 01:30:59.461
LAURA: Were you staying down for the show as well

01:30:59.461 --> 01:31:01.451
or did you come upstairs?

01:31:01.451 --> 01:31:04.681
ASHLEY: I came upstairs, but I was thinking about it,

01:31:04.681 --> 01:31:07.712
but I'm little sleepy.

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:10.454
LAURA: Yeah. Okay, then--
TALIESIN: You used to be fun.

01:31:10.454 --> 01:31:11.687
MARISHA: We're old.
LAURA: Yasha--

01:31:11.687 --> 01:31:12.803
ASHLEY: Yeah?

01:31:15.458 --> 01:31:16.583
LAURA: How are you?

01:31:18.087 --> 01:31:20.494
ASHLEY: (sighs)

01:31:20.494 --> 01:31:23.291
I'm doing pretty good.

01:31:23.291 --> 01:31:24.124
LAURA: Yeah?

01:31:24.124 --> 01:31:25.757
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel-- I feel...

01:31:28.307 --> 01:31:31.240
a lot better than I have in a while.

01:31:33.681 --> 01:31:34.741
LAURA: That's good.

01:31:34.741 --> 01:31:39.641
ASHLEY: But I mean, the current events are kind of weird.

01:31:39.641 --> 01:31:40.691
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:42.558 --> 01:31:43.741
ASHLEY: So--

01:31:43.741 --> 01:31:46.001
LAURA: You know, we didn't get to say goodbye to him.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.534
I mean, nobody got to say goodbye to him, but--

01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:51.786
ASHLEY: I know.

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:55.171
LAURA: It's weird to know he's up and moving

01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:57.691
and we can't say anything, we can't talk to him.

01:32:00.851 --> 01:32:02.976
ASHLEY: It's also weird to me that he...

01:32:04.467 --> 01:32:06.375
he didn't take his coat,

01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:07.875
but I guess...

01:32:09.616 --> 01:32:12.251
I mean, that's not him.

01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:13.084
LAURA: Yeah.

01:32:15.471 --> 01:32:17.791
ASHLEY: And I guess that says it's not him

01:32:17.791 --> 01:32:20.261
more than anything because he never took that off.

01:32:20.261 --> 01:32:22.586
LAURA: He loved that coat.
ASHLEY: He loved that coat.

01:32:26.531 --> 01:32:28.572
This is going to be weird.

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:33.338
LAURA: I'm glad you're--

01:32:33.338 --> 01:32:35.011
I'm glad you're feeling better, though.

01:32:35.011 --> 01:32:36.244
ASHLEY: Thank you.

01:32:37.530 --> 01:32:38.688
(sighs)

01:32:38.688 --> 01:32:41.454
Yeah, it's been quite a journey,

01:32:41.454 --> 01:32:43.414
but yeah, I'm feeling better.

01:32:45.081 --> 01:32:47.464
LAURA: So, um...

01:32:47.464 --> 01:32:49.841
there's two beds in here.

01:32:49.841 --> 01:32:51.241
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:32:51.241 --> 01:32:53.391
LAURA: So, um...

01:32:54.557 --> 01:32:56.744
how should we do this?

01:32:56.744 --> 01:33:00.311
ASHLEY: Well, I'm very comfortable sleeping on the floor.

01:33:00.311 --> 01:33:03.051
I'm used to it, so I can I can sleep on the floor.

01:33:03.051 --> 01:33:04.257
No big deal.

01:33:04.257 --> 01:33:07.136
LAURA: Are you sure you don't
want to take one bed, and...

01:33:07.136 --> 01:33:10.719
I could take another bed and then...

01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:12.268
Beau could just...

01:33:14.677 --> 01:33:17.535
take a bed, just somebody's bed,

01:33:18.381 --> 01:33:21.561
maybe just a little shnuggle?

01:33:21.561 --> 01:33:25.928
ASHLEY: Are you implying that
she should get in the bed, uh,

01:33:25.928 --> 01:33:27.486
with me?

01:33:27.486 --> 01:33:31.200
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh)

01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:33.751
ASHLEY: Um...

01:33:36.094 --> 01:33:38.211
LAURA: That's weird, I could move rooms.

01:33:38.211 --> 01:33:41.581
ASHLEY: No, really, honestly, I can sleep on the floor

01:33:41.581 --> 01:33:43.611
and Beau can take the bed.

01:33:43.611 --> 01:33:44.936
I think, um...

01:33:46.527 --> 01:33:49.910
my voice is cracking just talking about that.

01:33:50.871 --> 01:33:55.354
Yes, I'll sleep on the floor and Beau can have the bed.

01:33:56.561 --> 01:33:57.711
LAURA: Okay.

01:33:57.711 --> 01:33:58.811
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:33:59.841 --> 01:34:03.981
LAURA: If you got cold though, you could probably shneak in

01:34:03.981 --> 01:34:06.382
and shnuggle with her too, though.

01:34:09.241 --> 01:34:11.132
ASHLEY: Probably--

01:34:11.132 --> 01:34:12.748
yeah, I don't think I will,

01:34:12.748 --> 01:34:16.521
but I could probably "shnuggle" with her if I wanted to.

01:34:16.521 --> 01:34:18.291
Maybe-- I don't know, I would have to ask her

01:34:18.291 --> 01:34:20.132
and see if that would be something that--

01:34:20.132 --> 01:34:21.998
if she would want to sn-- "shnuggle."

01:34:21.998 --> 01:34:23.939
MATT: (laughs)
ASHLEY: (overwhelmed sigh)

01:34:23.939 --> 01:34:25.113
LIAM: Oop.

01:34:27.705 --> 01:34:28.738
ASHLEY: I...

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:33.041
She makes me really nervous.

01:34:33.041 --> 01:34:37.371
LAURA: Yeah, you don't get nervous very easily, it seems.

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:40.991
So that says something if you get flustered around her.

01:34:43.521 --> 01:34:45.437
ASHLEY: Yeah, she kind of, um--

01:34:48.554 --> 01:34:50.945
she's taken me by surprise.

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:53.894
I-- I--

01:34:55.902 --> 01:34:58.868
I don't know, I don't know what it all means, but um--

01:34:58.868 --> 01:35:00.556
LAURA: She's a wonderful person.

01:35:00.556 --> 01:35:01.772
ASHLEY: She's wonderful.

01:35:01.772 --> 01:35:03.480
SAM: (quiet skeptical grunt)

01:35:07.841 --> 01:35:10.015
She is. I--

01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:15.101
I know she's tough on the outside, but--

01:35:15.101 --> 01:35:17.061
LAURA: She's all warm and gooey on the inside.

01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:19.291
ASHLEY: Yeah, she is.

01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:22.641
LAURA: Just like Yasha, just like you,

01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:24.953
you're just a couple of marshmallows.

01:35:24.953 --> 01:35:26.842
ASHLEY: (laughs)

01:35:26.842 --> 01:35:29.401
I'm like a charred one.
LAURA: I'm getting nervous for you.

01:35:29.401 --> 01:35:30.891
Maybe I should leave the room.

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:32.299
ASHLEY: No, no.

01:35:33.631 --> 01:35:35.151
LAURA: I'm going to leave the room.

01:35:35.151 --> 01:35:37.759
ASHLEY: Wait, I-- but I feel like I--

01:35:37.759 --> 01:35:39.367
I feel like--

01:35:39.367 --> 01:35:41.558
I feel like I'm not ready.

01:35:42.521 --> 01:35:45.076
LAURA: Okay, I'll stay in the room.

01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:50.009
ASHLEY: (sputtering)

01:35:50.009 --> 01:35:52.087
Shit, I don't know what to do.

01:35:52.087 --> 01:35:52.981
(laughter)

01:35:52.981 --> 01:35:54.381
Because, you know, what if--

01:35:56.988 --> 01:35:59.611
I haven't even talked to her or anything about it

01:35:59.611 --> 01:36:01.305
because I don't know-- I--

01:36:04.028 --> 01:36:07.261
LAURA: So wait, okay you really didn't kiss her or anything

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.891
when you were flying around and stuff?

01:36:08.891 --> 01:36:10.591
ASHLEY: No, no, I didn't.

01:36:10.591 --> 01:36:12.657
I didn't because, um...

01:36:13.624 --> 01:36:17.201
You know, I don't know how
she feels and I feel like I--

01:36:17.201 --> 01:36:18.456
LAURA: Well, oh, yeah yeah yeah,

01:36:18.456 --> 01:36:20.651
oh, maybe I shouldn't tell you.

01:36:20.651 --> 01:36:22.204
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

01:36:22.204 --> 01:36:26.879
LAURA: Well, like, you know, I
talked to her and she's like, you know.

01:36:26.879 --> 01:36:27.804
She likes you.

01:36:27.804 --> 01:36:31.156
ASHLEY: Oh, I don't know if I should
know this because it's not from her, you know?

01:36:31.156 --> 01:36:32.981
LAURA: (laughs)

01:36:32.981 --> 01:36:36.149
ASHLEY: It's like, what if she just said
something and then you misinterpreted it?

01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:37.859
LAURA: No, I didn't.

01:36:37.859 --> 01:36:38.959
ASHLEY: How do you know?

01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:41.131
LAURA: Because she was like, "Yasha's pretty great,

01:36:41.131 --> 01:36:44.537
"she's hot, but I need her to make the first move."

01:36:45.481 --> 01:36:47.541
ASHLEY: She did?
LAURA: Yeah, she said that.

01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:48.740
SAM: (laughs)

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.240
ASHLEY: (groans)

01:36:52.135 --> 01:36:55.379
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know.

01:36:55.379 --> 01:36:57.204
I just-- she-- she-- she--

01:36:57.204 --> 01:36:59.195
she makes me so nervous.

01:37:00.411 --> 01:37:03.951
And I don't know why, like, she makes me sweaty

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:08.481
and, like, warm and fuzzy at the same time,

01:37:08.481 --> 01:37:11.805
and then I see her do things and
then I'm just like, I want to--

01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:14.529
I want to kiss her so bad.

01:37:17.835 --> 01:37:21.221
And then that makes me feel kind of bad.

01:37:21.221 --> 01:37:22.271
LAURA: Yasha.

01:37:26.021 --> 01:37:28.412
You can't feel guilty for how you feel.

01:37:28.412 --> 01:37:33.021
If she makes you feel happy, that's a wonderful thing,

01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:34.422
that's so rare.

01:37:36.376 --> 01:37:37.842
ASHLEY: It is so rare.

01:37:42.841 --> 01:37:44.991
Okay, how about this then.
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:46.182 --> 01:37:48.240
ASHLEY: (sighs)

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.064
I feel like you've given me a lot of confidence,

01:37:52.415 --> 01:37:53.248
but...

01:37:54.448 --> 01:37:56.914
stay with us tonight so it's not super obvious,

01:37:56.914 --> 01:37:59.514
because I feel like if she walks in and I'll be like,

01:37:59.514 --> 01:38:02.631
"Hello." I'll feel weird.

01:38:02.631 --> 01:38:04.855
Because now that we've talked about it,
it feels like it's out there

01:38:04.855 --> 01:38:07.338
and I feel like I want to...

01:38:07.338 --> 01:38:10.989
Yeah, just stay tonight, I'll sleep on
the floor and then I'll figure it out.

01:38:10.989 --> 01:38:12.556
LAURA: Okay.

01:38:12.556 --> 01:38:15.101
ASHLEY: (sighs)
LAURA: Okay.

01:38:15.101 --> 01:38:16.344
ASHLEY: Don't say anything to her.

01:38:16.344 --> 01:38:17.861
LAURA: I'm not going to say anything, I'm not going to say--

01:38:17.861 --> 01:38:20.252
I probably, trust me, I--

01:38:22.019 --> 01:38:23.827
I won't say anything.

01:38:23.827 --> 01:38:25.356
ASHLEY: Because the thing is, like, she could just have

01:38:25.356 --> 01:38:27.651
like a simple crush and could be over it really quickly.

01:38:27.651 --> 01:38:29.803
So I just, I want to give her space--

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:33.201
LAURA: It's not the vibe I got, just letting you know.
ASHLEY: It's not-- okay, okay.

01:38:33.201 --> 01:38:36.251
LAURA: But, maybe you should talk to her,

01:38:36.251 --> 01:38:38.661
because she'd probably have more information for you.

01:38:38.661 --> 01:38:41.691
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think it's probably
best to go to the source.

01:38:41.691 --> 01:38:43.037
LAURA: Yeah, probably.

01:38:44.501 --> 01:38:47.261
ASHLEY: Okay, thank you, Jester. (sighs)

01:38:47.261 --> 01:38:48.427
LAURA: You're welcome.

01:38:48.427 --> 01:38:52.369
If you want we could write a poem
for her or something, just-- you know.

01:38:53.431 --> 01:38:55.218
ASHLEY: I mean, sure.

01:38:55.218 --> 01:38:58.331
LAURA: Something you could recite to her

01:38:58.331 --> 01:39:00.341
when you're confessing your feelings.

01:39:00.341 --> 01:39:03.861
ASHLEY: Okay, like how would you-- spitballing,

01:39:03.861 --> 01:39:06.110
how would you even start something like that?

01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:07.435
LAURA: Um...

01:39:10.231 --> 01:39:13.981
"Oh, Beau, Beau, Beau" is probably how it starts.

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.671
ASHLEY: Yeah, I like that start.

01:39:15.671 --> 01:39:17.621
"Oh, Beau, Beau, Beau."

01:39:18.718 --> 01:39:19.951
LIAM: That's a good anime.

01:39:22.821 --> 01:39:26.891
ASHLEY: "Eyes so blue and hair so shorn on the sides."

01:39:26.891 --> 01:39:28.896
LAURA: Yeah, that's good, that's good.

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:33.134
ASHLEY: Okay. Eyes so blue, hair shorn.

01:39:34.692 --> 01:39:36.357
LAURA: "Abs, so many."

01:39:36.357 --> 01:39:37.298
ASHLEY: Her abs are so--

01:39:37.298 --> 01:39:39.824
There's so many of them.
LAURA: So many.

01:39:39.824 --> 01:39:41.611
ASHLEY: "So many abs--"

01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:43.281
LAURA: "But frame so small."

01:39:43.281 --> 01:39:46.692
ASHLEY: Frame so small. Yeah, she's so small.

01:39:46.692 --> 01:39:49.421
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh, ooh, I got a good one.

01:39:49.421 --> 01:39:53.011
"How I wish to envelop you with my wings."

01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:54.419
ASHLEY: Oh! Okay.

01:39:54.419 --> 01:39:58.591
"How I wish to envelop you with my wings."

01:39:58.591 --> 01:39:59.981
LAURA: You're a really good writer.

01:39:59.981 --> 01:40:01.731
ASHLEY: I really think this is really good.

01:40:01.731 --> 01:40:04.741
Like, maybe we should just end up making a poetry book

01:40:04.741 --> 01:40:07.601
with love poems.

01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:09.711
LAURA: And then we could sell it at Chastity's Nook.

01:40:09.711 --> 01:40:10.866
ASHLEY: I love it.

01:40:10.866 --> 01:40:12.791
Okay, these are some good ideas,

01:40:12.791 --> 01:40:15.071
I'm going to think on it and really--

01:40:15.071 --> 01:40:16.031
LAURA: All right.

01:40:16.031 --> 01:40:18.001
I'm going to pretend to be asleep when she comes in,

01:40:18.001 --> 01:40:20.081
so if you guys want to have a conversation or anything,

01:40:20.081 --> 01:40:23.701
and then if anything happens, then I'll just leave.

01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:26.031
That's weird. I'm just going to lay down.

01:40:26.031 --> 01:40:28.021
ASHLEY: Just sleep. I probably won't do it tonight.

01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:29.180
LAURA: Yeah, that would be weird.

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:31.221
ASHLEY: I'll find a really nice moment for it.

01:40:31.221 --> 01:40:33.219
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

01:40:33.219 --> 01:40:35.351
LAURA: I'm rooting for you, Yasha.

01:40:35.351 --> 01:40:36.211
ASHLEY: Okay, thank you.

01:40:36.211 --> 01:40:37.044
LAURA: Okay.

01:40:38.351 --> 01:40:40.518
LAURA and ASHLEY: (exhale)

01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:46.438
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to leave it at that for now.

01:40:46.438 --> 01:40:48.414
TRAVIS: I want a drink so bad right now.

01:40:52.161 --> 01:40:52.994
MATT: All righty.

01:40:52.994 --> 01:40:55.436
Any other business anyone would like to work

01:40:55.436 --> 01:40:57.341
towards this evening before it comes to an end?

01:40:57.341 --> 01:41:00.282
LIAM: "The properties of transmutation can--"

01:41:00.282 --> 01:41:02.131
(laughter)

01:41:02.131 --> 01:41:03.539
LIAM: Oh, this is exciting.

01:41:05.661 --> 01:41:07.784
TALIESIN: There once was a sailor named Fjord,

01:41:09.051 --> 01:41:11.754
who went shopping and was always quite bored.

01:41:11.754 --> 01:41:12.587
(laughter)

01:41:12.587 --> 01:41:14.778
TALIESIN: I'll workshop, I'll workshop.

01:41:19.225 --> 01:41:21.412
SAM: Henry Crabtree says--

01:41:21.412 --> 01:41:23.291
(laughter)

01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:26.401
"Always ask consent before you shnuggle!"

01:41:26.401 --> 01:41:28.353
(laughter)

01:41:28.353 --> 01:41:32.178
TRAVIS: Friends? Friends? Oh god, loneliness!

01:41:33.385 --> 01:41:35.894
MARISHA: Wait, is Henry Crabtree
going to be the consent grass?

01:41:35.894 --> 01:41:37.572
SAM: Grass.
MARISHA: Crabgrass, yeah.

01:41:37.572 --> 01:41:41.186
SAM: Henry Crabgrass, the Consent Grass.

01:41:41.186 --> 01:41:43.301
MARISHA: The non-grabass crabgrass.

01:41:43.301 --> 01:41:44.553
Yeah.

01:41:44.553 --> 01:41:45.941
(laughter)

01:41:45.941 --> 01:41:47.124
SAM: I like it.
TALIESIN: I saw it coming,

01:41:47.124 --> 01:41:48.707
and yet it still hurt.

01:41:49.711 --> 01:41:52.141
MATT: All right, you all eventually find your ways

01:41:52.141 --> 01:41:53.931
to your respective chambers for the night.

01:41:53.931 --> 01:41:56.871
MARISHA: I stumble in a little tipsy,

01:41:56.871 --> 01:41:59.201
accidentally trip over Yasha a little.

01:41:59.201 --> 01:42:00.034
ASHLEY: Hello!

01:42:00.034 --> 01:42:01.241
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry.

01:42:01.241 --> 01:42:03.071
(laughter)

01:42:03.071 --> 01:42:05.281
ASHLEY: Oh, you just got back?

01:42:05.281 --> 01:42:07.581
MARISHA: I did not mean to step on you.

01:42:07.581 --> 01:42:09.551
ASHLEY: No, no, no, no, no, no no.

01:42:09.551 --> 01:42:11.712
MARISHA: You want the bed? I can sleep on the floor

01:42:11.712 --> 01:42:12.678
if you want the bed.

01:42:12.678 --> 01:42:14.111
ASHLEY: I'm so accustomed to it.

01:42:14.111 --> 01:42:15.644
MARISHA: I am, too.
ASHLEY: It's what I'm used to.

01:42:15.644 --> 01:42:18.371
MARISHA: It's what we did in the monastery

01:42:18.371 --> 01:42:21.215
so if you want me to sleep and you can take the bed,

01:42:21.215 --> 01:42:22.048
it's not a big deal.

01:42:22.048 --> 01:42:26.111
ASHLEY: I feel like-- I've already been napping down here

01:42:26.111 --> 01:42:27.523
waiting for you to come back.

01:42:27.523 --> 01:42:30.698
Not-- I wasn't waiting. I was just laying here.

01:42:30.698 --> 01:42:32.581
Pretty sure--

01:42:32.581 --> 01:42:34.165
MARISHA: Is Jester asleep?

01:42:34.165 --> 01:42:35.321
LAURA: (very fake snoring)

01:42:35.321 --> 01:42:36.600
ASHLEY: I think--

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.691
MARISHA: I don't think she's asleep.

01:42:37.691 --> 01:42:40.646
ASHLEY: I don't think she's asleep.

01:42:40.646 --> 01:42:45.171
But you can have the bed because I'm set up nice here

01:42:45.171 --> 01:42:47.141
on the floor.

01:42:47.141 --> 01:42:48.431
MARISHA: Okay.

01:42:48.431 --> 01:42:51.541
ASHLEY: Yeah. How was the show?

01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:52.722
MARISHA: It was great.

01:42:52.722 --> 01:42:53.605
Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah, they were--

01:42:53.605 --> 01:42:55.221
MARISHA: There was this one girl

01:42:55.221 --> 01:42:57.931
who, like, she just opened this jar

01:42:57.931 --> 01:43:01.041
of glitter and then she full front flip

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.711
with the open jar of glitter,

01:43:02.711 --> 01:43:04.571
ass glitter. like, flew through the air.

01:43:04.571 --> 01:43:06.345
It was bananas, it was great.

01:43:06.345 --> 01:43:08.251
ASHLEY: I see you have a piece.

01:43:08.251 --> 01:43:10.035
MARISHA: Glitter was everywhere, yeah.

01:43:10.035 --> 01:43:12.084
(chuckles) Yeah, yeah.

01:43:12.084 --> 01:43:13.917
ASHLEY: It adds-- it's cool.

01:43:16.711 --> 01:43:21.711
Well, I'm pretty... tired.

01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:23.811
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I didn't mean to wake you up.

01:43:23.811 --> 01:43:26.821
ASHLEY: No, no, no, you didn't, I just I wanted to make sure

01:43:26.821 --> 01:43:31.491
that you got back safely, so I'm glad you are safe.

01:43:31.491 --> 01:43:32.324
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:43:35.001 --> 01:43:36.321
Sure you don't want the bed?

01:43:36.321 --> 01:43:37.401
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:43:37.401 --> 01:43:38.351
ASHLEY: I'm good.

01:43:38.351 --> 01:43:39.225
MARISHA: I'm just going to--

01:43:39.225 --> 01:43:41.125
ASHLEY: Unless you want to shnuggle or something?

01:43:41.125 --> 01:43:41.958
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laughs)

01:43:41.958 --> 01:43:43.342
ASHLEY: I'm kidding. That was just something that--

01:43:43.342 --> 01:43:44.425
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

01:43:45.799 --> 01:43:48.711
I'm going to-- sorry to step over you.

01:43:48.711 --> 01:43:52.811
Just a little. It's a tight hotel room.

01:43:52.811 --> 01:43:56.261
Okay, good night.

01:43:56.261 --> 01:43:58.169
ASHLEY: Good night. I'm going to...

01:43:58.169 --> 01:44:00.615
sleep on the-- right here.

01:44:00.615 --> 01:44:01.448
MATT: Mmkay.

01:44:01.448 --> 01:44:02.479
MARISHA: Good night, Jester.

01:44:02.479 --> 01:44:03.937
LAURA: (strained) Night, guys.

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:08.670
(laughter)

01:44:12.642 --> 01:44:13.475
MATT: All right.

01:44:13.475 --> 01:44:14.898
ASHLEY: Seven charisma.

01:44:14.898 --> 01:44:19.290
(laughter)

01:44:21.202 --> 01:44:22.641
TALIESIN: Assume they all take a point of exhaustion

01:44:22.641 --> 01:44:25.534
because none of them sleep. Just lie there.

01:44:26.451 --> 01:44:28.218
MARISHA: Stiff as a board,

01:44:28.218 --> 01:44:32.009
just drenching our sheets in sweat, yeah.

01:44:32.009 --> 01:44:33.311
(laughter)

01:44:33.311 --> 01:44:34.173
MATT: Okay then.

01:44:34.173 --> 01:44:35.006
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:44:35.006 --> 01:44:38.364
MATT: After an evening of rest for most of you,

01:44:39.221 --> 01:44:43.731
the morning does come and with it a new day.

01:44:43.731 --> 01:44:46.780
So the family is awake.

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:49.394
You wake up with Yeza,

01:44:49.394 --> 01:44:50.951
and Luc's already ready for breakfast

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:53.291
and you can smell the meals being prepared

01:44:53.291 --> 01:44:55.891
for the mess hall-like like breakfast experience

01:44:55.891 --> 01:44:57.301
that the lodge presents

01:44:57.301 --> 01:45:01.511
to the various denizens, but the day is yours.

01:45:01.511 --> 01:45:03.351
After breakfast is had you all gather down

01:45:03.351 --> 01:45:04.984
within the lodge's main chambers.

01:45:05.991 --> 01:45:07.264
What would you like to do?

01:45:08.181 --> 01:45:13.071
SAM: We should visit Pumat, get our stuff, excuse my family,

01:45:13.071 --> 01:45:15.411
and then get up and get going, right?

01:45:15.411 --> 01:45:16.244
LAURA: Yeah.

01:45:17.517 --> 01:45:19.021
MARISHA: Are they going to go back to--?

01:45:19.021 --> 01:45:22.705
LIAM: Caleb got up super early and
spent two more hours doing homework.

01:45:22.705 --> 01:45:23.975
MATT: Okay.

01:45:23.975 --> 01:45:25.821
MARISHA: Going to send them back to Nicodranas?

01:45:25.821 --> 01:45:28.021
SAM: I think so. I mean, unless they--

01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:29.631
Yeza, do you want to stay here?

01:45:29.631 --> 01:45:31.417
Oh! Yeza!

01:45:31.417 --> 01:45:32.461
MATT: "Yeah?"

01:45:32.461 --> 01:45:33.791
SAM: I've been meaning to ask you.

01:45:33.791 --> 01:45:35.341
MATT: "Sure, honey, what do you need?"

01:45:37.021 --> 01:45:41.584
SAM: I Disguise Self and turn into Vess DeRogna.

01:45:42.861 --> 01:45:43.801
Do you know this person?

01:45:43.801 --> 01:45:47.411
MATT: "Ah. Yeah. Why?"

01:45:47.411 --> 01:45:51.064
SAM: What did she to to you? Is she good or bad?

01:45:53.345 --> 01:45:57.510
MATT: "She was the one that was overseeing the project

01:45:57.510 --> 01:46:01.353
"the Assembly put me under. She's the one that set up the--"

01:46:01.353 --> 01:46:02.734
SAM: I'll drop the disguise.

01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:06.881
MATT: You can see the sweat pouring on his face already

01:46:06.881 --> 01:46:07.714
and comes forward and goes--

01:46:07.714 --> 01:46:09.181
SAM: Sorry, I didn't realize--

01:46:09.181 --> 01:46:11.781
MATT: "No, no, no, I just wasn't expecting that so early.

01:46:13.481 --> 01:46:18.481
"Yeah, she was the one that was overseeing

01:46:18.711 --> 01:46:23.229
"the work I was doing in Felderwin in the basement."

01:46:23.229 --> 01:46:27.021
SAM: To refine that stuff?

01:46:27.021 --> 01:46:31.679
MATT: "Yeah, that weird glowing thing."
SAM: The juice?

01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:35.620
MATT: "We worked to distill

01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:37.451
"that strange ether

01:46:37.451 --> 01:46:39.051
"that it was presenting.

01:46:39.051 --> 01:46:40.560
"I didn't fully understand the logistics of it,

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.511
"I was just applying my alchemical knowledge

01:46:42.511 --> 01:46:44.161
"to the things that she brought along.

01:46:44.161 --> 01:46:48.521
"But she's very, very intense, very intense woman."

01:46:48.521 --> 01:46:49.731
LAURA: What did she do to you?

01:46:49.731 --> 01:46:52.541
LIAM: Yeah, you're having a visceral reaction.

01:46:52.541 --> 01:46:57.516
MATT: "She's just very domineering.

01:46:57.516 --> 01:46:59.291
MARISHA: She hurt you?

01:46:59.291 --> 01:47:01.724
MATT: "No, no, no, no, she never <i>hurt</i> me.

01:47:02.661 --> 01:47:04.186
SAM: Did she threaten to hurt you?

01:47:04.186 --> 01:47:06.061
MATT: (nervous noises) "She would-- there were--"

01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:07.769
SAM: Did she imply that she would do things?

01:47:07.769 --> 01:47:11.972
MATT: "There were-- She is a very--"

01:47:11.972 --> 01:47:15.931
He, looking around, "She's very forceful

01:47:15.931 --> 01:47:19.827
"and persuasive individual."

01:47:21.741 --> 01:47:24.011
SAM: Oh, well, I'll fucking kill her.

01:47:24.011 --> 01:47:27.214
I mean, when we're done with our job, can I kill her?

01:47:29.001 --> 01:47:31.821
MARISHA: I think that's part of a super big, large,

01:47:31.821 --> 01:47:35.201
larger picture thing that involves Caleb

01:47:35.201 --> 01:47:37.734
and that big picture stuff.
TRAVIS: She's dead. We'll kill her.

01:47:37.734 --> 01:47:39.381
MARISHA: We'll kill her, is what I'm saying.
MATT: "She's--

01:47:39.381 --> 01:47:40.854
"She's really powerful and she's really well-connected

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.141
"with the Assembly.

01:47:42.141 --> 01:47:44.501
"Please don't do anything that will put yourself in danger.

01:47:44.501 --> 01:47:46.319
"This isn't just a random person

01:47:46.319 --> 01:47:49.706
"that was a problem and don't just go killing people

01:47:49.706 --> 01:47:50.539
"because they were mean.

01:47:50.539 --> 01:47:54.035
"I mean, like, she was a terrible boss, yeah.

01:47:54.035 --> 01:47:55.384
"I'm glad I don't work with her anymore, but, like--"

01:47:55.384 --> 01:47:59.461
SAM: Were you enslaved to her or did she ask you

01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:02.564
for your expertise and contract you?

01:48:04.671 --> 01:48:08.511
MATT: "More that, but they had specific goals

01:48:08.511 --> 01:48:13.101
"they wanted to hit on a continuously tightening timeline

01:48:13.101 --> 01:48:16.621
"and it was challenging work and I have my limitations,

01:48:16.621 --> 01:48:18.436
"you know that, but that wasn't--"

01:48:18.436 --> 01:48:21.297
LIAM: Did you see her or her colleagues hurt others?

01:48:22.201 --> 01:48:24.071
MATT: "Not to my knowledge. I just know about them,

01:48:24.071 --> 01:48:28.051
"I know who they are, I know how connected they are

01:48:28.051 --> 01:48:32.941
"and I wanted to help as best I can,

01:48:32.941 --> 01:48:35.462
"when asked upon, when called upon."

01:48:35.462 --> 01:48:38.611
LAURA: What happened in the chair?

01:48:42.133 --> 01:48:44.611
The chair, Yeza.

01:48:44.611 --> 01:48:46.471
TRAVIS: We saw your workshop. There was--

01:48:46.471 --> 01:48:48.018
MATT: "Oh yeah, I had a chair."

01:48:48.018 --> 01:48:50.366
TRAVIS: No, the, <i>the</i> chair.

01:48:51.351 --> 01:48:52.851
MATT: "You're right, I had a singular chair."

01:48:52.851 --> 01:48:55.961
MARISHA: Yeah, singular, surrounded by nothing else

01:48:55.961 --> 01:48:59.421
in the center of the room, it was very disconcerting.

01:48:59.421 --> 01:49:02.136
TRAVIS: How many souls were put through that chair?

01:49:02.971 --> 01:49:05.457
MATT: "I-I don't know. How-- how many?"

01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:10.128
SAM: Please don't psychologically torture my husband.

01:49:10.128 --> 01:49:12.286
(laughter)

01:49:15.171 --> 01:49:17.801
SAM: So the chair was just a chair, right?

01:49:17.801 --> 01:49:20.091
MATT: "Yes, it was just my work chair."

01:49:20.091 --> 01:49:23.731
SAM: Did you bring it or did they give it to you?

01:49:23.731 --> 01:49:24.564
MATT: "Well, I mean--"

01:49:24.564 --> 01:49:25.397
TRAVIS: (laughs) You fucking--

01:49:26.743 --> 01:49:30.011
"It was an acquisition as part of what I required

01:49:30.011 --> 01:49:31.111
"to begin to do the work

01:49:31.111 --> 01:49:32.911
"on the level and scale they needed."
SAM: So they gave it to you?

01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:33.744
MATT: "They did."

01:49:33.744 --> 01:49:36.681
MARISHA: I think the corruption
runs deeper than we even thought.

01:49:36.681 --> 01:49:39.584
SAM: Good to know, we'll table that.

01:49:40.561 --> 01:49:45.094
And you worked also with

01:49:45.094 --> 01:49:47.835
Ludinus Da'leth, is that right?

01:49:48.761 --> 01:49:51.841
MATT: "I didn't work too much with him directly.

01:49:51.841 --> 01:49:55.841
"He did come by on occasion to check up and interact

01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:57.551
"and ask questions.

01:49:57.551 --> 01:50:01.211
"It seemed like he was putting a lot of pressure

01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:04.202
"on Ms. DeRogna, and--"

01:50:04.202 --> 01:50:06.568
SAM: He was putting pressure on her?

01:50:06.568 --> 01:50:08.031
MATT: "Things roll downhill."

01:50:08.031 --> 01:50:10.081
MARISHA: We saw them arguing

01:50:10.081 --> 01:50:12.401
that one day that we rolled into Felderwin.

01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:13.234
LAURA: I remember.

01:50:14.503 --> 01:50:16.131
MARISHA: It was a long time ago.

01:50:16.131 --> 01:50:19.561
MATT: "But-- I mean, it's weird point of pride to take,

01:50:19.561 --> 01:50:22.461
"but me and her did manage to complete

01:50:22.461 --> 01:50:26.081
"what was asked of us within the truncated timeline.

01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:29.251
"Took a lot out of me, I didn't sleep a lot,

01:50:29.251 --> 01:50:33.861
"but we got it done, as all important discoveries

01:50:33.861 --> 01:50:38.121
"sometimes require, and weirdly, I was looking forward

01:50:38.121 --> 01:50:39.471
"to taking a break from alchemy for a while.

01:50:39.471 --> 01:50:42.164
"And while the circumstances were not what I wanted,

01:50:43.151 --> 01:50:46.021
"when the Dynasty took me for a while,

01:50:46.021 --> 01:50:47.367
"I didn't have to do much work."

01:50:49.801 --> 01:50:51.461
LAURA: Do we know what kind of breakthrough they had?

01:50:51.461 --> 01:50:52.311
Did we already figure it--?

01:50:52.311 --> 01:50:53.181
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:50:53.181 --> 01:50:57.901
SAM: They got a little vial of some fate juice.

01:50:57.901 --> 01:51:00.621
LAURA: Okay, you guys made the potions?

01:51:00.621 --> 01:51:04.071
MATT: "Yes, yes, you're able to do it.

01:51:04.071 --> 01:51:05.537
"I don't fully understand it.

01:51:05.537 --> 01:51:06.912
"I was only given but a portion

01:51:06.912 --> 01:51:11.141
"of the equation, the alchemical side of things, to focus on

01:51:11.141 --> 01:51:16.141
"and replicate the interior patterns,

01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:19.981
"the mandala-type, strange alchemical structures

01:51:19.981 --> 01:51:22.711
"that it could potentially siphon

01:51:22.711 --> 01:51:24.331
"when placed within that tripod.

01:51:24.331 --> 01:51:27.901
"And so we utilized that as a means of trying to draw,

"distill, and copy the materials that it was emanating,

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:35.001
"and channel it through various catalysts

01:51:35.001 --> 01:51:36.701
"and see if we could find a material

01:51:36.701 --> 01:51:38.051
"that could encapsulate it.

01:51:38.051 --> 01:51:39.781
"I'm not sure if it's permanent,

01:51:39.781 --> 01:51:41.321
"I don't know if there's a time period

01:51:41.321 --> 01:51:43.771
"in which must be utilized before it begins

01:51:43.771 --> 01:51:45.281
"to lose its potency,

01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:47.541
"but that was not part of my contract.

01:51:47.541 --> 01:51:50.031
"And if they were to come back on that, I was at that point

01:51:50.031 --> 01:51:53.401
"already being dragged over into Xhorhas, so."

01:51:53.401 --> 01:51:56.161
LIAM: We were in possession of it for a time.

01:51:56.161 --> 01:51:58.981
MATT: "Oh, so you're you're aware of this, then?"

01:51:58.981 --> 01:52:03.981
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but we entrusted it to a friend.

01:52:04.167 --> 01:52:05.227
MATT: "Understood.

01:52:10.771 --> 01:52:14.061
"If you do encounter any of these individuals,

01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:17.351
"just be careful and don't mention me."

01:52:17.351 --> 01:52:19.931
SAM: Don't mention you, all right.
MATT: "Don't mention me."

01:52:19.931 --> 01:52:23.580
SAM: And definitely kill her in revenge.

01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:26.351
MATT: "I would really-- honey, please."

01:52:26.351 --> 01:52:28.414
SAM: If I did though you wouldn't be upset.

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:32.225
MATT: "Well, look,

01:52:33.884 --> 01:52:35.267
"she's not a great person,

01:52:35.267 --> 01:52:38.161
"but she hasn't done anything to me,

01:52:38.161 --> 01:52:39.631
"I think, to deserve death."

01:52:39.631 --> 01:52:43.424
SAM: Okay, you're a fair person.

01:52:47.211 --> 01:52:48.331
MATT: "Anyway."

01:52:48.331 --> 01:52:51.081
SAM: Thank you. Sorry. Sorry to make you relive that trauma,

01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:54.224
I didn't realize she was so awful to you.

01:52:56.651 --> 01:52:58.871
MATT: "It's okay, it's over now."

01:52:58.871 --> 01:53:00.014
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:05.221
Anyway, we might be going on another leg of our journey.

01:53:05.221 --> 01:53:07.508
I know it's only been a couple days here in Zadash

01:53:07.508 --> 01:53:11.181
but would you like to rather go back home to the coast?

01:53:11.181 --> 01:53:12.961
Well, I guess that's home now, right?

01:53:12.961 --> 01:53:16.414
Or would you rather stay here without us, or?

01:53:18.621 --> 01:53:20.906
MATT: He looks over to Luc and Luc is in the middle of

01:53:20.906 --> 01:53:22.351
stuffing the remnants of

01:53:22.351 --> 01:53:24.831
this bowl of sugared porridge into his mouth

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.801
which you can see, more sugar

01:53:26.801 --> 01:53:28.461
has been put into it at this point then porridge

01:53:28.461 --> 01:53:31.304
and it has that grain, scraping sound

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:33.185
when he gets into it and crunches it like sand

01:53:33.185 --> 01:53:34.733
between his teeth.

01:53:34.733 --> 01:53:36.091
LAURA: He's doing it right.

01:53:37.641 --> 01:53:39.012
MATT: "Luc, do you want to stay here

01:53:39.012 --> 01:53:40.404
"or you want to go back Nicodranas?"

01:53:40.404 --> 01:53:42.741
He goes, "I want to go to the beach!"

01:53:42.741 --> 01:53:45.724
"Well, I guess that answers that question."

01:53:45.724 --> 01:53:47.361
SAM: Okay.

01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:48.641
MATT: "To be fair, it's really nice there."

01:53:48.641 --> 01:53:50.561
SAM: Yeah, it's the best.

01:53:50.561 --> 01:53:52.046
LAURA: It is.
LIAM: You have a home.

01:53:52.046 --> 01:53:54.591
SAM: Yeah. All right, well, we'll figure out a way

01:53:54.591 --> 01:53:57.071
to send you back probably today.

01:53:57.071 --> 01:53:59.404
MATT: "Okay, how long do you think you guys will be gone?"

01:54:01.251 --> 01:54:03.551
SAM: I don't know, it's hard to say.

01:54:03.551 --> 01:54:04.501
TALIESIN: Very hard to say.

01:54:05.406 --> 01:54:07.472
TRAVIS: Perhaps a couple of weeks, maybe.

01:54:07.472 --> 01:54:09.238
LIAM: Weeks, that's our minimum.
MARISHA: At least.

01:54:09.238 --> 01:54:12.491
MATT: "Okay, you did say you're able to come

01:54:12.491 --> 01:54:14.991
"and visit quickly now, right?"

01:54:14.991 --> 01:54:19.749
SAM: Yeah, if we're at a place where it's safe to transport.

01:54:19.749 --> 01:54:20.940
SAM: Yeah, if we're at a place where it's safe to transport.

01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:23.563
LIAM: Yes, I believe we will be able to visit you

01:54:23.563 --> 01:54:26.671
for the initial leg of our journey.

01:54:26.671 --> 01:54:29.383
There might be some time where that becomes complicated.

01:54:29.383 --> 01:54:30.901
MATT: "Okay.

01:54:30.901 --> 01:54:32.161
"Well, you'll know where to find us,

01:54:32.161 --> 01:54:34.335
"just take care and be safe,"

01:54:34.335 --> 01:54:35.201
SAM: Always.

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:36.654
MATT: "Don't take any unnecessary risks,

01:54:36.654 --> 01:54:39.734
"don't try and kill any members of the Cerberus Assembly."

01:54:40.961 --> 01:54:42.071
LIAM: Good advice.

01:54:42.071 --> 01:54:44.754
MATT: "And where are you going?"

01:54:47.705 --> 01:54:51.981
SAM: The North Pole, right? Pretty far north

01:54:51.981 --> 01:54:53.901
where it's very, very--

01:54:53.901 --> 01:54:58.901
MARISHA: Eiselcross, to the island of Foren.

01:54:59.041 --> 01:55:01.881
MATT: "I know pretty much nothing about that,

01:55:01.881 --> 01:55:05.791
"but I hope it's not too dangerous

01:55:05.791 --> 01:55:08.378
"and if you just happen to see--"

01:55:08.378 --> 01:55:09.951
and he leans in a little bit, whispering,

01:55:09.951 --> 01:55:13.521
"If you happen to see like, fun little knickknacks

01:55:13.521 --> 01:55:15.104
"of the area that you can pick up for Luc

01:55:15.104 --> 01:55:16.611
"when you're out and about?"
SAM: Of course, yeah, yeah.

01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:17.831
MATT: "I think he'll really appreciate that."

01:55:17.831 --> 01:55:20.991
SAM: Yeah, of course we'll get airport gifts

01:55:20.991 --> 01:55:22.031
on the way back, yeah.

01:55:22.031 --> 01:55:23.301
TALIESIN: You've got the--

01:55:23.301 --> 01:55:24.761
MARISHA: Yeah, the stein.

01:55:24.761 --> 01:55:26.151
SAM: Oh, that's right! That's right.

01:55:26.151 --> 01:55:29.984
I already got these two steins.

01:55:29.984 --> 01:55:31.227
Yeah.

01:55:31.227 --> 01:55:35.958
MATT: Luc looks over and goes-- scrapes it over.

01:55:35.958 --> 01:55:38.141
It's half the size of his torso, almost.

01:55:38.141 --> 01:55:39.157
He has to get both his hands up

01:55:39.157 --> 01:55:41.253
to press on the top to get the lid to open.

01:55:41.253 --> 01:55:44.319
He's like, "Cool!"

01:55:44.319 --> 01:55:47.441
All the porridge just caked around his mouth.

01:55:47.441 --> 01:55:52.364
He's like, (as Yeza) "I don't know
how long he'll appreciate that,

01:55:52.364 --> 01:55:54.811
"but I've seen him get obsessed with things

01:55:54.811 --> 01:55:57.721
"with less utility, so anything to distract him

01:55:57.721 --> 01:55:59.419
"from the crossbow."

01:56:01.361 --> 01:56:06.354
SAM: Well, he should do his practices, his drills and stuff.

01:56:06.354 --> 01:56:07.451
MATT: "I'll do my best."

01:56:07.451 --> 01:56:09.241
SAM: So that he can protect you.

01:56:09.241 --> 01:56:12.104
MATT: "And remember not to fire unless Daddy's behind you."

01:56:13.033 --> 01:56:14.158
(laughter)

01:56:14.158 --> 01:56:18.611
Kind of nods. (as Luc) "I know, I know."
(as Yeza) "All right."

01:56:18.611 --> 01:56:20.341
SAM: I don't know if we're ready to send you back

01:56:20.341 --> 01:56:22.389
quite yet so we might have to--

01:56:22.389 --> 01:56:25.548
LIAM: Yeah, we're going to go pick up an item here

01:56:25.548 --> 01:56:28.931
and then we would jump to Nicodranas

01:56:28.931 --> 01:56:31.611
and then we would jump to Rexxentrum.

01:56:31.611 --> 01:56:33.701
We just need to parse that out.

01:56:33.701 --> 01:56:36.551
Why don't we swing by for you in a couple of hours?

01:56:36.551 --> 01:56:38.971
We're going to do a little bit of last minute shopping

01:56:38.971 --> 01:56:41.331
here in town.

01:56:41.331 --> 01:56:43.181
MATT: "All right, we'll finish breakfast here.

01:56:43.181 --> 01:56:44.421
"We might walk around the block a bit

01:56:44.421 --> 01:56:46.361
"and we'll stay nearby until you need us."

01:56:46.361 --> 01:56:47.451
SAM: Okay.

01:56:47.451 --> 01:56:48.911
LAURA: Do we need to go to Nicodranas

01:56:48.911 --> 01:56:50.561
or can we just send them through?

01:56:52.461 --> 01:56:55.355
LIAM: Well, we'd be sending them into Yussa's Tower.

01:56:55.355 --> 01:56:57.190
LAURA: We could let them know that they're coming.

01:56:58.065 --> 01:57:00.388
LIAM: Sure, I think he would be all right with that.

01:57:03.471 --> 01:57:04.661
SAM: To Pumat's?

01:57:04.661 --> 01:57:05.494
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:57:06.941 --> 01:57:08.161
MATT: All right.

01:57:08.161 --> 01:57:08.996
SAM: To Pumat's.

01:57:08.996 --> 01:57:11.296
LIAM: To Pu-mat's.
SAM: To Pu.

01:57:12.261 --> 01:57:16.451
MATT: You guys make your way to the Pentamarket,

01:57:16.451 --> 01:57:18.434
to the exterior of Pumat's shop.

01:57:19.649 --> 01:57:22.631
The door is currently closed

01:57:22.631 --> 01:57:25.841
and it does not appear to be the same open,

01:57:25.841 --> 01:57:30.211
welcome interior presentation the shop normally does.

01:57:30.211 --> 01:57:32.711
It looks like it is intentionally closed and shut.

01:57:34.111 --> 01:57:37.874
TRAVIS: Working very hard, I would assume, on our items?

01:57:40.403 --> 01:57:41.602
SAM: Do we knock?

01:57:41.602 --> 01:57:42.962
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

01:57:43.787 --> 01:57:45.287
LIAM: Yeah, let's start with that.

01:57:46.717 --> 01:57:48.017
MATT: Okay.

01:57:48.017 --> 01:57:50.107
You hear some shuffling

01:57:50.107 --> 01:57:51.668
and eventually a voice goes,

01:57:51.668 --> 01:57:54.469
(as Pumat) "Uh. Hello?"

01:57:54.469 --> 01:57:55.427
LAURA: Aw.

01:57:56.897 --> 01:57:59.497
LIAM: Yeah, Pumat, it is the Mighty Nein.

01:57:59.497 --> 01:58:00.457
Are you all right in there?
MATT: "Right, right.

01:58:00.457 --> 01:58:02.027
"Yeah, come on in."

01:58:02.027 --> 01:58:04.587
SAM: Oh no!
MATT: You hear, (clicks, squeaks)

01:58:04.587 --> 01:58:06.730
the door opens and Pumat's standing there,

01:58:07.957 --> 01:58:10.360
big dark circles under his eyes.

01:58:11.387 --> 01:58:12.610
"Huh, well,

01:58:14.072 --> 01:58:16.467
"could you give us just, like, 20 more minutes

01:58:16.467 --> 01:58:17.300
"if you don't mind?

01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.557
"We're real close."

01:58:18.557 --> 01:58:21.247
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Again, I'm so sorry,

01:58:21.247 --> 01:58:23.477
that entirely happened by accident.

01:58:23.477 --> 01:58:24.977
We just had the wrong conversation

01:58:24.977 --> 01:58:26.617
in front of the wrong people.

01:58:26.617 --> 01:58:28.797
And, oh god--
MATT: "Oh, don't apologize.

01:58:28.797 --> 01:58:30.507
"I had no idea that this was

01:58:30.507 --> 01:58:33.670
"under Assembly-specific intent.

01:58:34.848 --> 01:58:37.377
"Next time if the contract falls under

01:58:37.377 --> 01:58:40.277
"an Assembly member, please do not hesitate

01:58:40.277 --> 01:58:43.647
"to let me know. There is a different spectrum

01:58:43.647 --> 01:58:44.897
"of timelines under there,

01:58:44.897 --> 01:58:48.017
"and would save me a lot of trouble."

01:58:48.017 --> 01:58:49.537
TALIESIN: Definitely apologize for that.

01:58:49.537 --> 01:58:51.094
I'll pay attention to that next time.

01:58:51.094 --> 01:58:52.747
This is definitely on me.

01:58:52.747 --> 01:58:54.677
Good to know.
MATT: "Greatly appreciated.

01:58:54.677 --> 01:58:57.100
"All right, just 20 minutes, come on back."

01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:58.219
TALIESIN: All right.

01:58:58.219 --> 01:59:00.227
MATT: Closes the door again.

01:59:00.227 --> 01:59:02.027
SAM: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

01:59:03.067 --> 01:59:03.900
ASHLEY: Well, that's good to know.

01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.350
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's great.

01:59:07.195 --> 01:59:08.567
ASHLEY: (sighs)

01:59:08.567 --> 01:59:10.737
LIAM: Yeah, maybe not take advantage of that again

01:59:10.737 --> 01:59:11.697
in the future.

01:59:11.697 --> 01:59:12.677
SAM: No. No.

01:59:12.677 --> 01:59:15.647
MATT: About 20 minutes of wandering the Pentamarket,

01:59:15.647 --> 01:59:18.187
there are numerous baked goods,

01:59:18.187 --> 01:59:20.397
snacks, small trinkets that can be picked up.

01:59:20.397 --> 01:59:22.007
It is an open market.

01:59:22.007 --> 01:59:24.127
LAURA: Buy a lot of stuff and just put it in my bag,

01:59:24.127 --> 01:59:25.257
so I have it for the trip.

01:59:25.257 --> 01:59:27.767
MATT: Okay, what kind of stuff?
LAURA: Lots of baked happiness.

01:59:27.767 --> 01:59:28.787
MATT: Baked happiness, you got it.

01:59:28.787 --> 01:59:29.947
Plenty of baked happiness purchased.

01:59:29.947 --> 01:59:32.787
We'll say, put it about five gold of baked happiness,

01:59:32.787 --> 01:59:33.657
which is a lot.

01:59:33.657 --> 01:59:35.512
LAURA: That is a lot.

01:59:35.512 --> 01:59:38.957
MATT: Your little haversack is definitely

01:59:38.957 --> 01:59:39.987
plump full of happiness.

01:59:39.987 --> 01:59:40.820
LAURA: Okay.

01:59:41.887 --> 01:59:45.507
MATT: You come back. The door is now unlocked,

01:59:45.507 --> 01:59:46.807
though it is still closed.

01:59:47.897 --> 01:59:49.597
And as you enter the establishment

01:59:49.597 --> 01:59:52.187
you can see the interior lanterns are lit.

01:59:52.187 --> 01:59:54.177
Pumat Prime is sitting at the desk,

01:59:54.177 --> 01:59:57.367
he has a damp cloth pressed against his forehead

01:59:57.367 --> 01:59:59.877
and he's just wiping his brow.

01:59:59.877 --> 02:00:02.567
And the other Pumats are sitting in stools,

02:00:02.567 --> 02:00:04.387
just breathing heavily.

02:00:04.387 --> 02:00:08.317
And you see walking around the corner,

02:00:08.317 --> 02:00:09.576
Lady Vess DeRogna.

02:00:09.576 --> 02:00:10.900
SAM: (gasps)

02:00:11.917 --> 02:00:13.277
MATT: (as Vess) "Ah, I see you have arrived

02:00:13.277 --> 02:00:16.537
"to pick up your specific object.

02:00:16.537 --> 02:00:18.527
"Well, we have managed to complete it,

02:00:18.527 --> 02:00:20.970
"expedited, with a bit of aid."

02:00:21.827 --> 02:00:23.247
SAM: You helped?

02:00:23.247 --> 02:00:26.647
MATT: I did indeed. Otherwise it would not have gotten done.

02:00:26.647 --> 02:00:28.317
SAM: Wow!

02:00:28.317 --> 02:00:30.037
MATT: "Present it, Pumat."

02:00:30.037 --> 02:00:33.287
He's like, "Ah, yeah, of course, sorry.

02:00:34.757 --> 02:00:36.757
"Ready for you, I got your,

02:00:36.757 --> 02:00:38.662
"if you don't mind there, Pumat."

02:00:38.662 --> 02:00:41.137
He's like, "Yeah, yeah, I'll be right back."

02:00:42.075 --> 02:00:43.427
And he goes the corner and comes back

02:00:43.427 --> 02:00:48.257
and sets the finished breastplate onto the table.

02:00:48.257 --> 02:00:50.707
It looks beautiful and it even feels

02:00:50.707 --> 02:00:52.297
almost slightly lighter.

02:00:52.297 --> 02:00:53.797
The sheen and shimmer is there

02:00:53.797 --> 02:00:55.717
as your initial requested

02:00:56.657 --> 02:00:59.139
coloration was presented on it.

02:00:59.139 --> 02:01:00.667
You can see there are a number of

02:01:00.667 --> 02:01:03.767
additional new runes that are just faintly pressed

02:01:03.767 --> 02:01:06.107
into certain areas where the metal plates meet

02:01:06.107 --> 02:01:07.867
to even further reinforce

02:01:08.707 --> 02:01:11.677
the magical protection that it infers.

02:01:11.677 --> 02:01:14.707
So, whereas previously it was just a--

02:01:14.707 --> 02:01:15.540
TALIESIN: It was a nothing.

02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:16.597
MATT: It is now a breastplate plus one.

02:01:16.597 --> 02:01:18.047
TALIESIN: Homemade. (laughs)
MATT: Yeah.

02:01:20.287 --> 02:01:21.267
TALIESIN: It's now a--?

02:01:21.267 --> 02:01:23.517
MATT: Breastplate plus one.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:25.310
SAM: Amazing!

02:01:27.357 --> 02:01:30.517
TALIESIN: I really appreciate it, I really do.

02:01:30.517 --> 02:01:31.907
MATT: (as Pumat) "Respectfully, my pleasure,

02:01:31.907 --> 02:01:34.547
"happy to do whatever we can

02:01:34.547 --> 02:01:36.847
"to help the interests of the Empire

02:01:36.847 --> 02:01:39.107
"and the Cerberus Assembly."

02:01:39.107 --> 02:01:40.787
And Lady Vess goes, "Of course.

02:01:40.787 --> 02:01:45.427
"And your hard work, as always, will be remembered.

02:01:45.427 --> 02:01:47.888
"Thank you, Pumat Sol."

02:01:47.888 --> 02:01:50.497
(as Pumat) "Yeah, no, it's our pleasure.

02:01:50.497 --> 02:01:51.855
"Miss Lady.

02:01:53.037 --> 02:01:57.339
"And good luck wherever you're going in a hurry."

02:01:58.287 --> 02:01:59.388
LAURA: Thank you, Pumat.

02:01:59.388 --> 02:02:01.455
SAM: Thank you.
TALIESIN: Thank you, I owe you a favor.

02:02:01.455 --> 02:02:04.917
MARISHA: I put down 500 more gold onto the counter for him.

02:02:04.917 --> 02:02:06.727
MATT: "Well, you really don't have to do that.

02:02:06.727 --> 02:02:09.864
"Respectfully, you've already paid for the piece and--"

02:02:09.864 --> 02:02:11.767
MARISHA: Respectfully,

02:02:11.767 --> 02:02:14.097
we requested a rush order,

02:02:14.097 --> 02:02:15.987
not the original conditions.

02:02:15.987 --> 02:02:18.559
Please, it's our pleasure.

02:02:18.559 --> 02:02:21.817
MATT: "Well, it's very kind of you there, Ms. Beauregard.

02:02:21.817 --> 02:02:23.217
"I greatly appreciate it."

02:02:23.217 --> 02:02:25.947
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, hang on.

02:02:25.947 --> 02:02:27.350
Say that one more time.

02:02:28.787 --> 02:02:29.937
MATT: "It's greatly appreciated."

02:02:29.937 --> 02:02:31.417
MARISHA: Nope, the thing you said before that.

02:02:31.417 --> 02:02:32.377
MATT: "Ms. Beauregard."

02:02:32.377 --> 02:02:34.360
MARISHA: The thing you said before that?

02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:35.383
MATT: "I don't remember."

02:02:35.383 --> 02:02:36.570
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:02:36.570 --> 02:02:38.097
TALIESIN: The greatly appreciated?

02:02:38.097 --> 02:02:39.287
LAURA: It's very kind of you?

02:02:39.287 --> 02:02:40.675
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:02:40.675 --> 02:02:41.627
MATT: "Very kind!

02:02:41.627 --> 02:02:44.177
"It was very kind of you,

02:02:44.177 --> 02:02:47.345
"Ms. Beauregard, greatly appreciated."

02:02:47.345 --> 02:02:49.245
TALIESIN: It was very kind of you, it's greatly appreciated.

02:02:49.245 --> 02:02:50.761
TRAVIS: It's a big, big step for you, Beau.

02:02:50.761 --> 02:02:52.637
Perhaps you should take a nap now, Pumat.

02:02:52.637 --> 02:02:54.189
MATT: "I think that's a good plan.

02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:56.827
"If you don't mind."
(as Pumat II) "I got it, don't worry."

02:02:56.827 --> 02:02:57.977
One of the clones walks over--

02:02:57.977 --> 02:03:01.397
SAM: The rosé flask, you didn't happen to...

02:03:01.397 --> 02:03:04.170
Nevermind, no, we can go without it. It's fine.

02:03:04.170 --> 02:03:05.874
MATT: (as Pumat Prime) "Do we have to rush the flask, too?"

02:03:05.874 --> 02:03:08.055
SAM: No, no, that's less important, I think.

02:03:08.055 --> 02:03:09.737
MATT: "We can get that in about an hour."

02:03:09.737 --> 02:03:10.857
SAM: No, no, it's fine.

02:03:10.857 --> 02:03:11.690
MATT: "If you're helping."

02:03:11.690 --> 02:03:12.617
SAM: It's fine.

02:03:12.617 --> 02:03:14.837
MATT: (as Vess) "What is this enchantment
you're talking about?"

02:03:14.837 --> 02:03:17.937
(as Prime) "Well, they had ordered a flask

02:03:17.937 --> 02:03:21.230
"that essentially is bottomless alcoholic content."

02:03:23.977 --> 02:03:26.560
(as Vess) "And this is important for our endeavors?"

02:03:27.521 --> 02:03:28.637
SAM: I mean--

02:03:28.637 --> 02:03:29.470
MARISHA: Yes.

02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:30.337
SAM: It's nice.

02:03:30.337 --> 02:03:31.647
MARISHA: Yes.

02:03:31.647 --> 02:03:33.587
SAM: But we don't, you know-
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:03:33.587 --> 02:03:35.677
SAM: I don't want Pumat to do any more work.

02:03:35.677 --> 02:03:37.768
No Pumat work, no.

02:03:38.723 --> 02:03:40.757
TRAVIS: Well, we just dropped five hund-o.

02:03:40.757 --> 02:03:41.590
MARISHA: 16.

02:03:42.818 --> 02:03:46.284
MATT: Lady Vess goes, "They say it's important."

02:03:46.284 --> 02:03:48.492
SAM: Oh god.
MATT: He goes, "All righty.

02:03:49.927 --> 02:03:52.207
"Yeah, just let them out, and lock behind

02:03:52.207 --> 02:03:53.807
"and give us about an hour or so.

02:03:53.807 --> 02:03:54.747
"We can knock this out."

02:03:54.747 --> 02:03:55.917
SAM: I don't need it. We don't need it.

02:03:55.917 --> 02:03:57.867
I'm canceling the order.

02:03:57.867 --> 02:04:00.647
MATT: "You've already paid it. It's..."

02:04:00.647 --> 02:04:02.177
SAM: I'll get it-- I'll get it on lay away.

02:04:02.177 --> 02:04:04.517
I'll get it-- I'll come back in a month. It's fine.

02:04:04.517 --> 02:04:05.350
MATT: "You sure?"

02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:07.907
SAM: I'm positive. I don't want you to do any more work.

02:04:09.147 --> 02:04:12.137
MATT: "Okay, then. Well, we'll continue this one

02:04:12.137 --> 02:04:13.747
"on its usual schedule.

02:04:13.747 --> 02:04:16.067
"It should be ready within the next day or two."

02:04:16.067 --> 02:04:16.900
SAM: Great.

02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:18.507
MATT: "So just swing on by."

02:04:18.507 --> 02:04:19.427
SAM: Thank you.

02:04:19.427 --> 02:04:20.260
MATT: "All righty."

02:04:21.777 --> 02:04:24.127
And as you guys all begin to leave

02:04:24.127 --> 02:04:26.917
you hear a "(relieved sigh)"

02:04:26.917 --> 02:04:28.667
behind you as you leave.

02:04:28.667 --> 02:04:30.797
Lady Vess begins to exit with you as well.

02:04:30.797 --> 02:04:35.167
MARISHA: As we leave, I slip Nott back her original flask

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:36.927
that I've now been holding onto

02:04:36.927 --> 02:04:39.307
since it's passed through so many hands.

02:04:39.307 --> 02:04:41.557
It's still whiskey,

02:04:41.557 --> 02:04:43.077
I know that's not what you're into,

02:04:43.077 --> 02:04:45.757
but maybe it'll keep you warm.

02:04:45.757 --> 02:04:46.694
SAM: Thank you.

02:04:46.694 --> 02:04:47.907
MARISHA: All right.

02:04:47.907 --> 02:04:49.627
SAM: That was very kind of you.

02:04:49.627 --> 02:04:50.460
MARISHA: Yeah, well--

02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.030
TRAVIS: More than twice in one day.

02:04:54.037 --> 02:04:56.027
MARISHA: Kindest person in the realm.

02:04:56.027 --> 02:04:58.454
Beauregard, let it be heard!

02:04:58.454 --> 02:05:00.617
TRAVIS: Not that at all, nope. Not even close, no.

02:05:00.617 --> 02:05:01.750
MARISHA: All right.

02:05:03.567 --> 02:05:05.379
MATT: (as Vess) "Well then, how soon do you think

02:05:05.379 --> 02:05:07.127
"you'll be ready to leave?"

02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:11.265
TALIESIN: Pick up the stuff in Rexxentrum

02:05:11.265 --> 02:05:12.278
and then we're ready to go.

02:05:12.278 --> 02:05:14.370
SAM: We should stop off in Rexxentrum one more time.

02:05:14.370 --> 02:05:16.337
TALIESIN: And then we'll leave from there.

02:05:16.337 --> 02:05:18.517
MATT: "Very well. I will meet you then."

02:05:18.517 --> 02:05:20.247
And (whooshes) she vanishes.

02:05:20.247 --> 02:05:22.557
TRAVIS: I feel like she could have taken us with her.

02:05:22.557 --> 02:05:23.994
Little wasteful, but cool.

02:05:23.994 --> 02:05:26.411
(laughter)

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:28.720
LAURA: Okay.

02:05:29.577 --> 02:05:30.747
Let's do it, let's go--

02:05:30.747 --> 02:05:32.065
LIAM: We're going to go send your family on their way?

02:05:32.065 --> 02:05:33.298
SAM: Send them home.

02:05:34.437 --> 02:05:35.757
By circle?

02:05:36.727 --> 02:05:38.307
LIAM: Yeah, we will send them to Yussa.

02:05:38.307 --> 02:05:40.527
I really think we should prepare Yussa for that, though.

02:05:40.527 --> 02:05:43.277
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to send a message to,

02:05:43.277 --> 02:05:47.727
not Yussa, but to his butler.
LIAM: Butler?

02:05:47.727 --> 02:05:49.610
SAM: Wormwood, no.

02:05:49.610 --> 02:05:50.997
What's his name?

02:05:50.997 --> 02:05:52.035
MATT: It's Wensforth.

02:05:52.035 --> 02:05:53.152
LAURA: Wensforth.

02:05:53.152 --> 02:05:53.985
Yes.
SAM: Wensforth?

02:05:53.985 --> 02:05:55.553
MATT: Wensforth.
SAM: Wensforth.

02:05:56.827 --> 02:05:58.097
LAURA: Hey.

02:05:58.097 --> 02:06:00.625
So, we're not coming through, but

02:06:05.572 --> 02:06:10.367
Nott's-- Veth's husband and son are.

02:06:10.367 --> 02:06:14.917
So be ready for them to come.

02:06:14.917 --> 02:06:17.648
Really appreciate the help.

02:06:17.648 --> 02:06:18.481
Bye!

02:06:20.637 --> 02:06:23.807
MATT: Moment before the voice comes back, goes,

02:06:23.807 --> 02:06:25.032
(as Wensforth) "Hello. All right,

02:06:25.032 --> 02:06:26.798
"I'll go ahead and prepare for their coming.

02:06:26.798 --> 02:06:30.187
"I'll make sure the master doesn't see.

02:06:30.187 --> 02:06:34.033
"And I'll escort them into the streets."

02:06:35.027 --> 02:06:36.144
LAURA: Nice.

02:06:36.144 --> 02:06:36.977
SAM: That would be nice.

02:06:36.977 --> 02:06:39.107
LAURA: Wensforth's going to take care of it.

02:06:39.107 --> 02:06:41.531
SAM: I fucking hate that guy, but sure, yeah, let's do it.

02:06:41.531 --> 02:06:44.864
(laughter)

02:06:46.187 --> 02:06:47.617
LIAM: Well, I'll go up to my--

02:06:47.617 --> 02:06:50.537
we're at the inn where the show happened

02:06:50.537 --> 02:06:51.370
for Beauregard, right?

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:52.925
So I'll just run up to my room, still,

02:06:52.925 --> 02:06:54.274
which is pretty early.
LAURA: Just for Beauregard.

02:06:54.274 --> 02:06:55.858
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Just for me.

02:06:55.858 --> 02:06:56.891
Only for me.

02:06:56.891 --> 02:07:00.287
LIAM: And get it all ready and

02:07:00.287 --> 02:07:03.304
fetch everyone once it's 95% complete.

02:07:03.304 --> 02:07:04.170
And then we'll send them on their way.

02:07:04.170 --> 02:07:05.537
You want to say goodbye?

02:07:05.537 --> 02:07:09.437
SAM: Yes. You're going to be seeing a goblin

02:07:09.437 --> 02:07:11.290
when you land on the other side.

02:07:12.339 --> 02:07:14.007
MATT: (as Yeza) "Oh, okay."

02:07:14.007 --> 02:07:17.377
SAM: He's not going to try to kidnap you

02:07:17.377 --> 02:07:20.057
or ransom you or anything like that.

02:07:20.057 --> 02:07:24.357
He's one of the good ones.

02:07:24.357 --> 02:07:29.357
MATT: "Well, there were a few in
Rosohna that weren't so bad."

02:07:29.357 --> 02:07:30.587
SAM: Yeah.

02:07:30.587 --> 02:07:32.973
So, just don't be scared.

02:07:33.924 --> 02:07:36.237
MATT: "I think we've seen worse, right, Luc?"

02:07:36.237 --> 02:07:38.665
And Luc just goes, (gun cocking sound).

02:07:38.665 --> 02:07:39.606
(as Yeza) "No!

02:07:40.477 --> 02:07:41.310
"Friends."

02:07:42.857 --> 02:07:44.187
(as Luc) "Okay."

02:07:44.187 --> 02:07:45.417
SAM: We'll see you in a few weeks.

02:07:45.417 --> 02:07:46.990
We'll send messages.

02:07:47.866 --> 02:07:50.540
If you hear someone weird talking to you in your ear-

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:51.373
LAURA: It's me!

02:07:51.373 --> 02:07:52.287
SAM: It's Jester.

02:07:52.287 --> 02:07:53.910
MATT: "Okay, I'll look out for that."

02:07:54.827 --> 02:07:56.027
Luc walks up and tugs

02:07:56.027 --> 02:07:59.637
on the front of your shirt and is like, "Mommy,

02:07:59.637 --> 02:08:01.357
"if you're going to kill more cool things,

02:08:01.357 --> 02:08:02.607
"just make sure you write them down

02:08:02.607 --> 02:08:03.617
"so you can tell them when you come back."

02:08:03.617 --> 02:08:04.747
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:08:04.747 --> 02:08:07.247
Yeah, and maybe Jester can draw a picture of it.

02:08:07.247 --> 02:08:08.080
LAURA: I'll draw a picture

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:09.347
of everything that we kill.
MATT: (as Luc) "That'd be so cool!"

02:08:09.347 --> 02:08:10.180
SAM: Yeah.

02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:11.013
MATT: "Okay!"

02:08:11.013 --> 02:08:13.267
SAM: Yeah, we'll do it, promise.
MATT: "Okay."

02:08:13.267 --> 02:08:14.460
SAM: All right, be good.

02:08:15.757 --> 02:08:18.117
LIAM: I will kneel down and before I finish,

02:08:18.117 --> 02:08:19.617
I'll hold up the chalk and say,

02:08:19.617 --> 02:08:21.987
try not to worry too much about her.

02:08:21.987 --> 02:08:23.387
You know each of us on our own,

02:08:23.387 --> 02:08:25.897
we're pretty confident in our own right

02:08:25.897 --> 02:08:27.707
but the nine of us together,

02:08:27.707 --> 02:08:31.287
I give a little bump to Luc's chest, are mighty.

02:08:31.287 --> 02:08:32.453
See you soon.

02:08:32.453 --> 02:08:34.567
(chalk sounds, whoosh)

02:08:34.567 --> 02:08:36.397
MATT: They stand there for a second going, "Whoa,"

02:08:36.397 --> 02:08:37.817
looking at the circle.

02:08:37.817 --> 02:08:38.850
LAURA: Go, go, go, go, go!

02:08:38.850 --> 02:08:40.547
SAM: See you soon.
MATT: (as Yeza) "Oh, oh!

02:08:40.547 --> 02:08:43.446
"See you!" (boof) Luc goes, "That's so cool!"

02:08:43.446 --> 02:08:45.397
(boof) Gone.

02:08:45.397 --> 02:08:50.193
Moments of the runes (hums)

02:08:50.193 --> 02:08:51.144
(powering down)

02:08:51.144 --> 02:08:53.077
and all the chalk drawings that Caleb had left

02:08:53.077 --> 02:08:55.577
all began to burn off like incense ash.

02:08:55.577 --> 02:08:57.335
(rustling hiss)

02:08:57.335 --> 02:09:00.670
Leaving the floor clean, as if the symbol was never behind.

02:09:03.157 --> 02:09:07.287
SAM: Whelp, we forge off to another adventure.

02:09:07.287 --> 02:09:08.677
MARISHA: You all right?

02:09:08.677 --> 02:09:10.027
SAM: Yeah!

02:09:10.027 --> 02:09:12.277
No, this is a cool arrangement.

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:14.477
Get to check in with them and

02:09:14.477 --> 02:09:15.993
check in with you and

02:09:17.137 --> 02:09:18.587
it feels good.

02:09:18.587 --> 02:09:20.927
LIAM: Yeah, I don't think anything
more than a couple of weeks

02:09:20.927 --> 02:09:23.110
will go by at the most.

02:09:25.437 --> 02:09:28.247
Help the Empire, change the world,

02:09:28.247 --> 02:09:29.557
see your family.

02:09:29.557 --> 02:09:30.857
MARISHA: Help the Empire.

02:09:30.857 --> 02:09:32.097
SAM: It's a good balance.

02:09:32.097 --> 02:09:32.930
MARISHA: Wow.

02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:33.997
TALIESIN: That's a phrase.

02:09:33.997 --> 02:09:35.155
MARISHA: Yeah, it is.

02:09:36.337 --> 02:09:37.868
LIAM: Well.

02:09:37.868 --> 02:09:40.027
I need to draw another one of these, correct?

02:09:40.027 --> 02:09:41.341
We're going to Rexxentrum?

02:09:41.341 --> 02:09:42.327
LAURA: Yes.

02:09:42.327 --> 02:09:43.468
MARISHA: To the capital.

02:09:43.468 --> 02:09:45.094
LIAM: Okay.

02:09:45.094 --> 02:09:46.207
Spend the next 10 minutes

02:09:46.207 --> 02:09:47.847
drawing the different circle.

02:09:47.847 --> 02:09:48.680
MATT: All right.

02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:52.057
With that circle complete, you all rush through

02:09:52.057 --> 02:09:53.265
and return once more

02:09:53.265 --> 02:09:57.397
to the archive beneath Rexxentrum's Cobalt Soul.

02:09:57.397 --> 02:09:58.448
LAURA: Oops.

02:09:58.448 --> 02:09:59.281
(laughter)

02:09:59.281 --> 02:10:00.490
As soon as we pop through.

02:10:01.332 --> 02:10:02.674
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:10:02.674 --> 02:10:06.331
MATT: Bit of a spook on arrival, but not a huge issue.

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:07.711
MARISHA: We did it again!

02:10:07.711 --> 02:10:09.677
MATT: (laughs)

02:10:09.677 --> 02:10:11.917
It's a brief upset, but

02:10:11.917 --> 02:10:14.947
it seems to wash over without major issue.

02:10:14.947 --> 02:10:17.347
But you have returned to the center of the city.

02:10:18.317 --> 02:10:19.717
Is there anything else you wish to accomplish

02:10:19.717 --> 02:10:20.647
before you leave?

02:10:20.647 --> 02:10:21.480
SAM: Pick up clothes.

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.313
MATT: You can pick up all your clothes.

02:10:22.313 --> 02:10:26.917
You go and one by one, gather all of your various custom,

02:10:26.917 --> 02:10:31.587
requested pieces of northern attire.

02:10:31.587 --> 02:10:32.647
To your specifications,

02:10:32.647 --> 02:10:34.997
with the money that you dropped on these,

02:10:34.997 --> 02:10:37.197
the tips that you had given,

02:10:37.197 --> 02:10:40.667
nary a piece is not immaculate.

02:10:40.667 --> 02:10:43.520
And directly to the specifications required.

02:10:44.567 --> 02:10:46.157
Beautiful,

02:10:46.157 --> 02:10:47.137
in some cases rustic,

02:10:47.137 --> 02:10:50.233
in some cases, fucking goth as shit.

02:10:50.233 --> 02:10:51.567
(laughter)

02:10:51.567 --> 02:10:54.537
You acquire your gear,

02:10:54.537 --> 02:10:57.047
you put upon the various elements

02:10:57.047 --> 02:10:59.237
of your clothing that you've acquired,

02:10:59.237 --> 02:11:00.967
and make your way towards the tower

02:11:00.967 --> 02:11:03.977
where Vess DeRogna awaits your arrival.

02:11:03.977 --> 02:11:07.637
There you can see herself is wearing

02:11:07.637 --> 02:11:11.137
a deep, deep green,

02:11:11.137 --> 02:11:15.177
almost black colored robe with heavy brown

02:11:15.177 --> 02:11:17.107
and white fur edges and a hood

02:11:17.107 --> 02:11:18.927
that is up with a fur edge as well

02:11:18.927 --> 02:11:20.417
that droops down past the shoulders.

02:11:20.417 --> 02:11:24.217
You can see the clasp itself is jewel emblazoned

02:11:24.217 --> 02:11:25.987
with a heavy chain between.

02:11:25.987 --> 02:11:28.827
Beneath the robe you can see

02:11:28.827 --> 02:11:31.777
thick elements of padded cloth.

02:11:31.777 --> 02:11:33.837
Everything meant to keep her warm

02:11:33.837 --> 02:11:36.160
in the direction that you are all going.

02:11:37.207 --> 02:11:39.667
Thick leather gloves upon her hands.

02:11:39.667 --> 02:11:42.307
And as you enter the tower itself,

02:11:42.307 --> 02:11:44.107
the temperature inside is cold.

02:11:44.107 --> 02:11:45.647
You can see that since she's wearing the attire,

02:11:45.647 --> 02:11:46.857
she's already adjusted the temperature

02:11:46.857 --> 02:11:49.347
to be comfortable within her home.

02:11:49.347 --> 02:11:51.427
And as you all make your way within

02:11:51.427 --> 02:11:53.882
she looks about to the rest of you.

02:11:53.882 --> 02:11:56.328
"Well? Are you ready?"

02:11:57.757 --> 02:11:59.257
LIAM: Guess we'd better button up.

02:12:05.147 --> 02:12:05.980
LAURA: Okay.

02:12:10.397 --> 02:12:11.230
MATT: "Very well."

02:12:13.627 --> 02:12:15.607
She begins to do the same similar hand motions

02:12:15.607 --> 02:12:17.047
that you saw her do in Zadash.

02:12:17.047 --> 02:12:19.597
And you watch how she traces these symbols through,

02:12:20.937 --> 02:12:25.937
the cold weather suddenly rushes, even chillier.

02:12:26.257 --> 02:12:29.347
And with a brief moment of you all feeling your

02:12:30.437 --> 02:12:32.167
air almost pulled from your lungs

02:12:32.167 --> 02:12:33.207
for a second,

02:12:33.207 --> 02:12:35.847
the warm dark interior shifts

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:38.320
to a bright, almost snow blind sky.

02:12:39.267 --> 02:12:44.207
You can see a white and gray atmosphere above you.

02:12:44.207 --> 02:12:45.770
A gentle snowfall.

02:12:46.607 --> 02:12:49.877
Just drifting around you as your feet crunch

02:12:49.877 --> 02:12:51.550
on soft snow beneath your feet.

02:12:52.587 --> 02:12:55.357
As you glance around, you can see

02:12:56.507 --> 02:12:58.897
to the left of you, rolling hills

02:12:58.897 --> 02:13:02.067
and fields of glittering diamonds.

02:13:02.067 --> 02:13:04.380
A few miles off on that side.

02:13:05.477 --> 02:13:07.897
And to the right of you, you can see on the horizon,

02:13:07.897 --> 02:13:10.840
the cold, distant blue of ocean waters.

02:13:12.387 --> 02:13:17.382
And a cliff-side shoreline.

02:13:19.477 --> 02:13:22.967
There, built along this low cliff,

02:13:22.967 --> 02:13:25.720
this northern boundary of the Crystalsands Tundra,

02:13:26.707 --> 02:13:28.947
you can see the small fishing village

02:13:28.947 --> 02:13:31.777
of maybe a hundred or more scattered snow covered structures

02:13:31.777 --> 02:13:33.597
and four wooden watchtowers,

02:13:33.597 --> 02:13:36.490
mostly surrounded by a 10 foot vertical log barrier.

02:13:38.417 --> 02:13:41.060
This is Palebank Village.

02:13:41.967 --> 02:13:44.377
The northernmost part of civilization

02:13:44.377 --> 02:13:47.437
here on the main continent of Wildemount.

02:13:47.437 --> 02:13:51.957
And your destination to acquire passage northward

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:54.927
to the frozen continent of Eiselcross.

02:13:56.374 --> 02:13:57.207
That's where we're going to take a break.

02:13:57.207 --> 02:13:59.089
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

02:13:59.089 --> 02:13:59.922
SAM: Getting real.

02:13:59.922 --> 02:14:01.597
TRAVIS: Time to crack this map back out.
SAM: Here we go. Here we go.

02:14:01.597 --> 02:14:02.938
TRAVIS: ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪

02:14:02.938 --> 02:14:04.682
LIAM: New biome, who dis?

02:14:04.682 --> 02:14:06.459
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:14:06.459 --> 02:14:07.727
MATT: So--
LIAM: Eiselcross...

02:14:07.727 --> 02:14:09.907
MATT: -- we shall return here in just a moment,

02:14:09.907 --> 02:14:11.697
once we get through our break.

02:14:11.697 --> 02:14:14.447
See you all in a few minutes and we'll pick it up then.

02:14:15.170 --> 02:14:16.940
Now, experience the ultimate
(dramatic music)

02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:20.880
way to play, by sitting at a table with your friends,

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.860
with your face in a screen.

02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:24.170
Progress!

02:14:24.170 --> 02:14:26.150
D&amp;D Beyond.

02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:27.480
Log in to explore
(dramatic music)

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:30.100
strange worlds and fantastical cities,

02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:33.210
thanks to a company, based in a really boring one,

02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:34.930
that handles all the tedious math

02:14:34.930 --> 02:14:37.500
and reference stuff for you, so you can finally

02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:39.470
unleash the epic quest you've been crafting

02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:41.660
since middle school on your friends,

02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:44.520
or just do what most people use it for, cranking out

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.870
endless new characters while they're bored at work.

02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:47.703
I could finish
(rock music)

02:14:47.703 --> 02:14:51.251
these spreadsheets, but what if this paladin owned a horse?

02:14:51.251 --> 02:14:53.922
(heroic music)

02:14:53.922 --> 02:14:55.010
Perfect.

02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:56.340 line:20%
D&amp;D Beyond.

02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:58.443 line:20%
Play with advantage.

02:14:59.290 --> 02:15:01.260
There are key facets, we've noticed,

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:02.530
to a proper Narrative Telephone,

02:15:02.530 --> 02:15:05.350
that involve elements of alliteration.

02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:07.140
Were carting the cadaver of a cleric

02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:09.610
of Corellon, named Christophe Kazmar.

02:15:09.610 --> 02:15:11.830
Conversations and character changes.

02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:13.513
Who are you, Großmutter?

02:15:13.513 --> 02:15:15.720
And, what are you doing in these woods?

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:18.680
I am these woods, Kind.

02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:19.513
Proper nouns.

02:15:19.513 --> 02:15:22.740
I took a big swig of mycothistle extract.

02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:24.440
Changes to locations with extremely

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:26.820
detailed descriptions of the environment.

02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:29.440
And, from there, you have to go four days north.

02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:31.110
On dusk on the fourth day,

02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:33.760
you will come across a grove of trees.

02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:35.530
Backtracking through the narrative.

02:15:35.530 --> 02:15:36.570
That's a big one.

02:15:36.570 --> 02:15:38.653
I almost forgot to tell you the recipe!

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:42.414
Well, you can figure it out.

02:15:42.414 --> 02:15:43.800
Ta-ta for now.

02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:45.520
And now, a change of character.

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.494
But, first, oh, shit!

02:15:47.494 --> 02:15:49.582
Hey, get away from there, you little weasel,

02:15:49.582 --> 02:15:51.393
dingle bat, piece of shit!

02:15:51.393 --> 02:15:53.059
Oh, hi.
Like, there's so many things

02:15:53.059 --> 02:15:55.460
that we learned through this, guys. We have evolved.

02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:57.567
♪ There once was a-- ♪

02:15:57.567 --> 02:15:58.763
♪ There once was-- ♪

02:15:58.763 --> 02:15:59.840
(laughing)

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:03.130
To create, truly, something horrifying.

02:16:03.130 --> 02:16:04.740
I'm proud of all of us.
(laughing)

02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:06.140
I haven't evolved here, guys.

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:08.550
No, I've been left behind.
(laughing)

02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:09.813 line:20%
I stayed true!

02:16:09.813 --> 02:16:13.270 line:20%
(mysterious music)

02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:15.437
(popping)

02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:28.260
A lotta people are wanting to know

02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:29.740
your feelings on this, Marisha,

02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:33.440
since we haven't had you on a Talks episode in months,

02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:35.480
and I like to make them, it's about a big event

02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:37.350
that happened, since we were on hiatus,

02:16:37.350 --> 02:16:39.720
but I like to make them wait.

02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:42.610
Sometimes, we'll put a real banger question at the end.

02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:43.880
It's like the news.

02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:45.650
You know when the news will kinda tease you

02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:47.760
and say, coming up, at the, you know,

02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:48.700
they don't tell you it's gonna be

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:50.840
in the last 10 seconds of the episode.

02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:53.600
They're finally gonna show you the six-eyed walrus,

02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:56.220
the baby walrus that rescued the group of Bolivian,

02:16:56.220 --> 02:16:58.890
the soccer team that fell into the well,

02:16:58.890 --> 02:17:02.080
you know, when they were, they went on the sightseeing trip

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:03.710
and then you're like, show me the goddamn

02:17:03.710 --> 02:17:05.460
baby walrus rescuing the kids.

02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:08.210
I don't give a shit about that treadmill recall,

02:17:08.210 --> 02:17:09.918
even though I have two of them.

02:17:09.918 --> 02:17:10.751
(laughing)

02:17:10.751 --> 02:17:11.830
That's what this question is, Marisha.

02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:13.380
Why do you have two treadmills?

02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:14.806
With you, 100%.
And, why haven't you sent

02:17:14.806 --> 02:17:15.639
them back after recall?
I have one on the ceiling

02:17:15.639 --> 02:17:16.540
over here, I can't move my camera,

02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:18.127
I have one on the ceiling and I have one down here.

02:17:18.127 --> 02:17:19.960
So--
Just so you can, like,

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:20.820
do you do the backwards

02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:22.360
walk with the hands?
It's all about circulation?

02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:24.650
No, no, no, I'm not concerned with upper body strength.

02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:26.680
I need my thighs to be made

02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:27.903
of vibranium.
We've noticed.

02:17:27.903 --> 02:17:31.200
And, I care about nothing else in the world.

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.340
But, anyways.
(laughing)

02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:34.173
Marisha.
So, what was your question?

02:17:34.173 --> 02:17:35.430
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:17:35.430 --> 02:17:36.720
We don't have time.

02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:39.785
We ran out of time.
(laughing)

02:17:39.785 --> 02:17:42.535
(dramatic music)

02:17:43.396 --> 02:17:46.150
(wind blowing)
(pages rustling)

02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:47.803
Let me tell you a story.

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:53.570
A story about a group of nerdy-ass voice actors who decided

02:17:53.570 --> 02:17:57.243
to roll the dice and play a tabletop RPG together.

02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:01.250
As they triumphantly battled dragons,

02:18:01.250 --> 02:18:04.870
aberrations and even gods, little did they know

02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:07.373
just how far their stories would reach,

02:18:08.210 --> 02:18:12.650
for this game would grow into so much more.

02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:15.600
And so, the nerdy-ass voice actors vowed

02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:18.740
to spread the joy of their stories to all who reign--

02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:20.443
Okay, okay, okay.

02:18:20.443 --> 02:18:21.880
(record scratching)

02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:23.960
Matt, mind if I take it from here?

02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:25.500
Oh, sure.

02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:26.790
Thanks, buddy.

02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:29.680
So, our home game started just like any other,

02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:31.680
but once the show began to take off

02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:34.790
and we received so much support from the community,

02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:36.520
we knew we wanted to pay it forward

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:39.870
and use our platform to raise money for charity.

02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:42.490
Early on, we partnered with 826LA,

02:18:42.490 --> 02:18:44.830
because we felt like supporting creative writing

02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:47.880
and children fit with our love of storytelling.

02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:49.850
And, we've helped raise money for a number of

02:18:49.850 --> 02:18:53.800
other charities with causes close to our hearts, such as...

02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:55.160
Red Nose Day.

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.563
OutRight International.

02:18:56.563 --> 02:18:57.794
OSD.

02:18:57.794 --> 02:18:59.170
And, Pablove.

02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:01.170
Just to name a few.

02:19:01.170 --> 02:19:03.390
Over these past few years, Critical Role

02:19:03.390 --> 02:19:04.980
and the critter community has raised

02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:09.624
over $600,000 for charitable organizations.

02:19:09.624 --> 02:19:10.457
(laughing)

02:19:10.457 --> 02:19:13.390
These endeavors made us realize that our mission,

02:19:13.390 --> 02:19:14.500
not just as a company,
(crashing)

02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:16.750
but as a group of friends, is to leave--

02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:19.088
Leave this world better than we found it.

02:19:19.088 --> 02:19:20.938
(laughs) Thanks, Taliesin.

02:19:21.810 --> 02:19:25.073
And thus, we're proud to bring you

02:19:25.073 --> 02:19:27.290
(heroic music)

02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:30.170
the Critical Role Foundation,

02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:34.160
a nonprofit organization that's dedicated to that mission.

02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:35.870
Furthering our charitable efforts and building

02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:38.360
a deeper relationship with nonprofit organizations

02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.040
has been a dream of ours for a while.

02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:42.240
And now, that dream has come true.

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:45.270
This allows us to run specific fundraising campaigns

02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:48.430
for causes we and the critter community care about.

02:19:48.430 --> 02:19:51.230
And, given the state of the world these days,

02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:53.330
a percentage of every dollar raised

02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:56.070
will be allocated into an emergency fund

02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:59.040
to allow CRF to donate funds in the event

02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:02.040
of a natural disaster or other unforeseen events

02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:04.808
that require immediate humanitarian assistance.

02:20:04.808 --> 02:20:05.641 line:20%
(bell ringing)

02:20:05.641 --> 02:20:07.530 line:20%
And, since Critical Role Foundation

02:20:07.530 --> 02:20:10.370 line:20%
is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit,

02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:14.360
your donation is 100% tax deductible in the United States.

02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:16.520
Travis, read the room!

02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:19.690
It's a storybook, not a tax return.

02:20:19.690 --> 02:20:21.960
The cast and company are working hand-in-hand

02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:25.480
with this foundation, with Ashley here as its president.

02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:27.639
Thank you, Madam President.

02:20:27.639 --> 02:20:29.202
(applause)

02:20:29.202 --> 02:20:30.670
(laughing)

02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:32.730
For those who have donated in the past

02:20:32.730 --> 02:20:35.270
and for those who donate in the future,

02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:38.230
we thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.

02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:42.653 line:20%
You can learn more and donate at criticalrolefoundation.org.

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:46.120 line:20%
And thus, begins a whole new chapter

02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.743 line:20%
for this group of nerdy-ass voice actors.

02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:50.573
The end.

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:53.690
Well, not literally, of course,

02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:58.690
but that's the end of this storybook announcement.

02:20:58.767 --> 02:21:01.517
(cheerful music)

02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:14.553
Hey, critters!

02:21:14.553 --> 02:21:15.780
Laura Bailey here.
(upbeat music)

02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:18.272
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:21:18.272 --> 02:21:20.360
(coins falling)

02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:25.360
It's perfect for the home or the office or your bathroom.

02:21:25.647 --> 02:21:26.690
(chimes ringing)

02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:28.793
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:21:30.272 --> 02:21:31.500
(thumping)

02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:33.640
You're only, like, five clicks away from owning this.

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:36.170
Maybe more, if you have a lot of windows open

02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:38.731
on your browser, I don't know your life.

02:21:38.731 --> 02:21:39.830
(ravens croaking)

02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:41.560
Ooh, look at this.

02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:43.523
Look at the details, ooh.

02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:46.707
(didgeridoo)

02:21:46.707 --> 02:21:48.680
This is a lot of stuff, you guys.

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:51.313
We have, like, so many cool things right now.

02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:55.720
Darling, I recommend buying two.

02:21:55.720 --> 02:21:59.140
One for you and another for you.

02:21:59.140 --> 02:21:59.973
Let's be honest.

02:22:02.817 --> 02:22:03.758
(clicking)

02:22:03.758 --> 02:22:08.675
All this and more, now available in the Critical Role shop!

02:22:11.817 --> 02:22:14.340
(book slamming)
(dramatic music)

02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:16.540
Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:19.960
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:24.220
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:27.760
on the other side of the fourth wall.

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:30.160
And, what is this fourth wall,

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.800
separating the viewer from the creator?

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:35.650
A portal to an often-sought point of connection

02:22:35.650 --> 02:22:38.893
or the Twitch Subscription Zone?

02:22:39.930 --> 02:22:41.420
On the rare occasion that you miss

02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:44.930
the live bacchanal, boasted by the ragtag group of thespians

02:22:44.930 --> 02:22:48.730
on Thursday night, you may always view the show on demand,

02:22:48.730 --> 02:22:53.430 line:20%
in the shadowland known as the Twitch Subscription Zone.

02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:55.780
Picture, if you will, the necessary pieces

02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:58.750
to complete a jigsaw puzzle, but it's up to you

02:22:58.750 --> 02:23:01.280
to choose how it will be solved.

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:04.760 line:20%
You could, of course, subscribe with your debt rectangle,

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:07.890
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

02:23:07.890 --> 02:23:09.870
Perhaps, you've found yourself in possession

02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:14.190 line:20%
of an Amazon Prime account, you would then wake up

02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:17.160
to discover a free Twitch subscription each month,

02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:19.370
for a channel of your choosing.

02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:21.500
But, this artifact demands renewal,

02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:23.610 line:20%
for you must resubscribe each month

02:23:23.610 --> 02:23:25.653 line:20%
to quench its unyielding thirst.

02:23:26.610 --> 02:23:28.610
One need not walk alone.

02:23:28.610 --> 02:23:30.430
Those who have already found their way

02:23:30.430 --> 02:23:32.710
can illuminate the path for others,

02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:35.483 line:20%
via the Gift a Sub button on Twitch.

02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:39.650
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:41.180
and wishes to thank you from behind

02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:44.620
the thin veil of this fourth wall.

02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:48.250
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

02:23:48.250 --> 02:23:51.100
And so, ends another meandering digression,

02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:54.780
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway,

02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:58.803
to the region we call the Twitch Subscription Zone.

02:23:59.645 --> 02:24:02.228
(creepy music)

02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:08.673
You will subscribe.

02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:13.310
Twitch Prime, subscribe.

02:24:13.310 --> 02:24:15.133
Gift, subscribe.

02:24:16.871 --> 02:24:18.743
Subscribe.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.710
MATT: And welcome back.

02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:14.543
So,

02:37:15.490 --> 02:37:17.630
Mighty Nein, as you stand out

02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:20.370
in the midst of this soft snow fall

02:37:20.370 --> 02:37:23.260
on the northern cusp of the Greying Wildlands,

02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:24.290
you begin to make your way

02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:27.593
towards the coastal village of Palebank Village.

02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:31.420
As Vess DeRogna leads you this direction

02:37:32.740 --> 02:37:33.943
what would you like to do?

02:37:35.850 --> 02:37:36.800
TRAVIS: What time of day?

02:37:37.860 --> 02:37:38.933
MATT: At this point,

02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:41.830
you guys rested for the evening,

02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:43.143
came back to Zadash,

02:37:44.050 --> 02:37:47.040
I'd say it's like, little afternoon.

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.430
SAM: Are we so far north that, like, the sun never sets

02:37:50.430 --> 02:37:52.570
or it's always dark?
MATT: Not quite that far.

02:37:52.570 --> 02:37:53.560
SAM: Okay.
MATT: No.

02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:56.160
TRAVIS: These are the Greying Wildlands.
LIAM: But we're heading to the village,

02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:58.970
do we see the village yet in the distance or?

02:37:58.970 --> 02:38:01.640
MATT: You do see the village. You're not terribly far off.

02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:02.920
You're about maybe a 10 minute walk from it.

02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:04.140
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:38:04.140 --> 02:38:06.936
LIAM: And how big is it? It's a little place?

02:38:06.936 --> 02:38:08.310
MATT: It's not massive.

02:38:08.310 --> 02:38:13.010
You see roughly a hundred structures total for the village.

02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:15.063
That includes small hovels and

02:38:17.470 --> 02:38:20.330
sheds amongst a couple of larger buildings

02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:21.573
look almost like

02:38:24.490 --> 02:38:28.700
moots or large lodges, if anything,

02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:32.234
but it's a very small village.

02:38:32.234 --> 02:38:33.760
LAURA: And it's already snowy, snowy here?

02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:34.603
MATT: It is, yes.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000
MARISHA: I guess we go in and look for Dagen Underthorn?

02:38:41.045 --> 02:38:42.480
TRAVIS: Who?

02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:45.710
MARISHA: Our expedition guide that we're supposed to find.

02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:48.260
TRAVIS: Yup, I have that in my notes.

02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:50.810
MATT: (as Vess) "Actually, Dagen is waiting for us

02:38:50.810 --> 02:38:52.887
at Balenpost."
TRAVIS: Balenpost.

02:38:52.887 --> 02:38:55.360
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, my notes were wrong.

02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.193
TRAVIS: Okay, I got it.

02:38:56.193 --> 02:38:58.970
MATT: However, we are here to acquire a ship

02:38:58.970 --> 02:39:01.010
to take us to Balenpost.

02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:03.910
LAURA: Oh, you should have Fjord talk to them, then.

02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:08.260
MATT: "Are you a, uh... accomplished seaman?"

02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:11.030
TRAVIS: Yes, of course. Quite a bit.

02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:12.473
LAURA: He's a pirate captain.

02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:14.582
MATT: "Well, then."

02:39:14.582 --> 02:39:15.810
TRAVIS: Balenpost...

02:39:15.810 --> 02:39:19.378
SAM: We're all quite accomplished
on the high seas, actually.

02:39:19.378 --> 02:39:20.693
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a journey, y'all.

02:39:20.693 --> 02:39:22.653
MATT: "Very good then, very good."

02:39:24.250 --> 02:39:27.926
LAURA: As you can tell, he's quite
experienced with reading maps.

02:39:27.926 --> 02:39:29.500
SAM and MATT: (laugh)

02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:30.750
TRAVIS: Well, it seems like we'd have to go

02:39:30.750 --> 02:39:35.536
from the Palebank Village to Syrinlya?

02:39:35.536 --> 02:39:37.295
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, Balenpost, okay, yeah, yeah.

02:39:37.295 --> 02:39:39.710
MATT: "We would probably not want to stop there directly.

02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:42.210
"Balenpost is the

02:39:43.352 --> 02:39:48.352
Empire-helmed and held location.

02:39:48.727 --> 02:39:51.038
"Syrinlya belongs to Uthodurn,

02:39:51.038 --> 02:39:55.060
"and, while doable, is not perhaps

02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:57.180
"in the same sphere of influence as to make it easier

02:39:57.180 --> 02:39:59.853
"for us to find what we need and make our way."

02:40:00.752 --> 02:40:01.768
TRAVIS: I mean, it's fine with me,

02:40:01.768 --> 02:40:04.190
just seems the established trade routes

02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:07.020
according to these maps, like a touch point

02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:10.140
in between distances that are far apart.

02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:11.800
We'll have to go around the north edge

02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:14.673
of the Crystalsands Tundra?

02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:16.535
MATT: "Indeed."

02:40:16.535 --> 02:40:18.774
LAURA: (laughs)

02:40:18.774 --> 02:40:21.708
I'm sorry. What time should we leave in the morning, dad?

02:40:21.708 --> 02:40:24.404
Should we leave at 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m.

02:40:24.404 --> 02:40:26.661
to get to our location in time?

02:40:28.249 --> 02:40:29.183
TRAVIS: I don't know.

02:40:29.183 --> 02:40:30.570
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:40:30.570 --> 02:40:31.953
TRAVIS: Where's Orly?

02:40:33.930 --> 02:40:35.060
It's a long...

02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:36.850
Have you done this by ship before?

02:40:36.850 --> 02:40:37.800
MATT: "I have."

02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:39.320
TRAVIS: Oh, so you didn't stop before,

02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:40.870
you just went straight through?

02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:44.273
MATT: We did. Well, we stopped before, yes, but

02:40:46.410 --> 02:40:47.840
"due to the...

02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:50.643
"Uthodurnian neutrality,

02:40:51.490 --> 02:40:54.390
"it can prove challenging, should we encounter

02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:58.500
"Dynasty interests there as well."

02:40:59.540 --> 02:41:01.390
TRAVIS: Right.
MATT: "Balenpost,

02:41:01.390 --> 02:41:03.660
"the Assembly has influence there,

02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:06.000
"which means it is far easier for us

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.640
"to acquire what is needed

02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:11.110
"without issue, without impasse

02:41:11.110 --> 02:41:13.040
"and to avoid unnecessary violence

02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:15.700
"before we make our way northward."

02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:16.770
LAURA: Makes sense.

02:41:16.770 --> 02:41:18.503
Nobody wants to see violence.

02:41:19.570 --> 02:41:20.460
SAM: No.

02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:24.980
Do you have a person that you go to buy boats from,

02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:27.980
rent boats from, or just walk up, or do you have?

02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:29.900
MATT: "It has been some time since I've been here.

02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:31.890
"It is possible it is a different individual,

02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:33.660
"we will find out, and we will inquire

02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:36.220
"as to the best means of passage.

02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:39.306
"Usually just paying for passage upon a vessel

02:41:39.306 --> 02:41:41.300
"that is already making the trip."

02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:42.700
SAM: Okay.

02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:45.011
Well, let's head to the docks, then.

02:41:45.011 --> 02:41:46.810
MATT: "Very well."

02:41:46.810 --> 02:41:49.820
So, as you approach the nearest outer gate,

02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:53.950
the large log wall that greets you,

02:41:53.950 --> 02:41:55.980
you can see three figures in thick leathers

02:41:55.980 --> 02:41:57.660
and furs up above the top

02:41:57.660 --> 02:42:00.220
that all seem to be holding heavy crossbows

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:01.553
and glancing over the top.

02:42:03.887 --> 02:42:06.190
Some of them have arrows nocked in longbows

02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:10.293
and one of them shouts,
"Who arrives and with what business?"

02:42:11.310 --> 02:42:13.980
"Lady Vess DeRogna of the Cerberus Assembly,

02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:17.523
"my business is my own, and I come with my companions."

02:42:18.650 --> 02:42:19.750
Bit of a conversation.

02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:24.683
(as guard) "Right, just don't cause any trouble!

02:42:24.683 --> 02:42:26.550
"We got Glassblades all over the place.

02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:27.950
"We're keeping an eye on you."

02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:30.570
TALIESIN: Glassblades?

02:42:30.570 --> 02:42:32.214
MATT: The doors.

02:42:32.214 --> 02:42:33.824
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Glassblades?

02:42:33.824 --> 02:42:35.400
MATT: Glassblades, you've heard before,

02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:37.100
though you may not have.

02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:40.450
That is the name of the Uthodurnian guard.

02:42:40.450 --> 02:42:42.297
TALIESIN: Ah.
LAURA: Oh, yeah, remember?

02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:44.350
ASHLEY: What a cool name.

02:42:44.350 --> 02:42:46.350
MATT: As the gates slowly shift open,

02:42:46.350 --> 02:42:48.000
only but maybe three feet,

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.060
they're heavy enough that they only have to open

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:51.720
so wide to let you through.

02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:54.910
And as you push in, you're immediately greeted by

02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:58.430
these muddy streets of gray and brown slush

02:42:58.430 --> 02:43:00.480
with the snow packed off of to the sides

02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:02.580
and these heavy hills of white snow

02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:05.890
that push against the rickety, rustic wooden buildings

02:43:05.890 --> 02:43:09.630
that push against the narrow streets and alleys.

02:43:09.630 --> 02:43:11.320
You can see the dirt and sand,

02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:13.700
and a thick layer of snow

02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:15.980
that pushes into many of the untraveled paths.

02:43:15.980 --> 02:43:19.330
You can see footsteps and small walkways

02:43:19.330 --> 02:43:22.380
from between where the wall and the exterior buildings meet

02:43:22.380 --> 02:43:23.860
where individuals walk through.

02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:26.043
But the

02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:27.950
number of people that live here,

02:43:27.950 --> 02:43:29.620
the population is not so dense

02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:31.090
as to be anywhere near

02:43:31.090 --> 02:43:34.690
as continuously walked as such as Rexxentrum

02:43:34.690 --> 02:43:37.273
or Zadash, from where you previously hailed from.

02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:41.410
Most of the villagers appear to be Uthodurnian in origin.

02:43:41.410 --> 02:43:45.060
You see dwarf and elf alike,

02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:47.990
as well as a smattering of other people

02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:49.840
and of other backgrounds

02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:52.650
wandering the streets with warmer attire.

02:43:52.650 --> 02:43:56.510
You can see most everyone is armed and armored in some way.

02:43:56.510 --> 02:43:59.700
This rough and tumble location

02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:03.560
outside of any central center for civilization,

02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:06.250
especially in a place as challenging

02:44:06.250 --> 02:44:08.700
in both weather pattern

02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:11.550
and whatever else may exist in the wilds

02:44:11.550 --> 02:44:13.840
beyond these heavy walls,

02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:15.863
folks have to keep themselves protected.

02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:18.280
MARISHA: Does this feel like

02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:21.600
a town with families

02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:22.980
or is it just an

02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:25.700
in-between spot destination

02:44:25.700 --> 02:44:27.410
almost like a fort?
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:29.043
LIAM: Or is it Frozen Deadwood?

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:30.833
MARISHA: Exactly.

02:44:30.833 --> 02:44:32.920
It feels like Frozen Deadwood.

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:35.190
What did you say perception, or investigation?

02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:36.930
MATT: It would be perception.

02:44:36.930 --> 02:44:39.010
MARISHA: It's not good.

02:44:39.010 --> 02:44:40.021
15.

02:44:40.021 --> 02:44:42.023
MATT: 15?
MARISHA: No,

02:44:42.023 --> 02:44:43.750
13, even worse.

02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:45.900
MATT: Okay. Well, looking through the town

02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:47.040
as you make your way

02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:48.310
through the first couple of streets

02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:50.100
into the first what you can--

02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:51.450
if you would call it a thoroughfare.

02:44:51.450 --> 02:44:53.870
These thin roads open into one crossroads,

02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:55.110
it's a bit wider and you can see

02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:58.130
there's a couple of poles

02:44:58.130 --> 02:45:00.782
that rise up with hooks on them,

02:45:00.782 --> 02:45:03.410
with oil lanterns hanging from them,

02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:06.120
though they are not currently lit.

02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:09.081
And as you glance about, you can see

02:45:09.081 --> 02:45:13.260
a handful of children here,

02:45:13.260 --> 02:45:17.070
with accompaniment, parental or otherwise.

02:45:17.070 --> 02:45:20.710
And you get the sense that there probably are families here

02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:22.550
but most everyone you see around you

02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:25.650
appear to be going about their business of the day

02:45:25.650 --> 02:45:28.493
pulling carts of supplies from location to location.

02:45:29.731 --> 02:45:31.960
And you get the sense, based on the proximity

02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:34.480
of the coastline, that this is

02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:36.920
most likely a heavily fishing-based village

02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:39.310
as far as the sustenance that comes here.

02:45:39.310 --> 02:45:42.703
Anything else, as far as vegetation and

02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:46.130
alternative means of sustenance

02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:49.110
would probably make its way from Uthodurn

02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:51.298
and not be grown anywhere nearby.

02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:55.340
MARISHA: Frozen Deadwood.

02:45:55.340 --> 02:45:56.724
TALIESIN: Anchorage.

02:45:56.724 --> 02:45:58.490
MARISHA: Yeah, Anchorage.

02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:59.980
TRAVIS: Are the streets cared for here

02:45:59.980 --> 02:46:04.200
or is it like, shin-high, knee-high snow?

02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:06.280
MATT: The streets aren't cared for;

02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:08.400
there's no real cobblestone,

02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:10.540
it is just mud and dirt,

02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:12.630
with the snow becoming slush.

02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:14.770
And you can see there are pools and small puddles

02:46:14.770 --> 02:46:15.830
as you continue to push through it

02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:18.400
where your footfalls splatter and slide

02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:21.053
against the slick bottom of this walkway.

02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:24.930
You can see a lot of the snow is pushed to the sides,

02:46:24.930 --> 02:46:26.710
whether it be just through

02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:28.070
people naturally making their way through

02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:29.770
or folks come through in the morning

02:46:29.770 --> 02:46:30.820
and possibly shovel off

02:46:30.820 --> 02:46:32.973
to give it some sort of a walkway.

02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:36.630
Let's see.

02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:40.270
Actually, with your passive investigation,

02:46:40.270 --> 02:46:43.130
I'd say looking about at the various shapes on the ground

02:46:43.130 --> 02:46:44.150
and the patterns of snow,

02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:48.290
you can see it looks like the main roads are shoveled.

02:46:48.290 --> 02:46:50.170
There are grooves in both the mud

02:46:50.170 --> 02:46:53.350
and the gathering embankments of slush and snow

02:46:53.350 --> 02:46:54.200
that lead you to believe

02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:55.947
that people do care somewhat to it,

02:46:55.947 --> 02:46:58.015
at least let people pass through.

02:47:01.090 --> 02:47:02.122
TRAVIS: Straight down to the docks?

02:47:02.122 --> 02:47:03.540
LAURA: Let's go.
SAM: I think so.

02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:05.250
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:47:05.250 --> 02:47:09.530
Passing by the buildings, they're of

02:47:09.530 --> 02:47:11.210
patchwork make.

02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:14.320
You see some structures that have

02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:18.520
architecture that resembles the slapdash,

02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:20.850
wood-on-nail presentation

02:47:20.850 --> 02:47:23.350
that a lot of Shadycreek Run had.

02:47:23.350 --> 02:47:25.270
You see some buildings that have a semblance

02:47:25.270 --> 02:47:28.770
of elvish construction, but due to a lack of materials

02:47:28.770 --> 02:47:31.840
or a lack of time, it lacks the polish and pizazz

02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:35.048
that a lot of the structures within Uthodurn carried.

02:47:36.060 --> 02:47:38.060
You can see there are a couple of small,

02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:40.550
appear to be almost tavern,

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:45.190
or food acquisition locations within here.

02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:48.080
You see one large lodge in the center here,

02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:49.360
it looks like one of the larger buildings

02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:50.210
that you saw from a distance,

02:47:50.210 --> 02:47:53.380
this massive meeting hall-type lodge

02:47:53.380 --> 02:47:56.830
that has these gargantuan tusks or horns

02:47:56.830 --> 02:47:59.060
that adorn over the main doorway

02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:01.567
and a sign that says, Winter's Tit Lodge.

02:48:01.567 --> 02:48:04.360
(laughter)

02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:06.933
Continuing past, you go towards,

02:48:08.170 --> 02:48:09.723
what you assume at a glance,

02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:12.430
one of the Glassblades' quarters.

02:48:12.430 --> 02:48:14.490
You can see a number of Glassblade soldiers

02:48:14.490 --> 02:48:17.280
are training on the outside.

02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:19.400
There's an open area where the field

02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:20.790
has been cleared out of most snow

02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:23.010
and there are archery stations,

02:48:23.010 --> 02:48:24.620
there are practice dummies,

02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:28.030
there are racks for armor and weapons

02:48:28.030 --> 02:48:29.300
that are currently being distributed

02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:31.710
or currently worn by soldiers in training

02:48:31.710 --> 02:48:33.840
with the attire--

02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:37.370
The Glassblades have, not a direct uniform,

02:48:37.370 --> 02:48:41.380
but they have colors and some pins and patterns

02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:44.500
to signify their presence and membership

02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:46.730
of the Glassblades, but even they,

02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:49.140
as a body of people,

02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:52.843
have a very scattered semblance of uniform.

02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:57.570
And that is labeled as the Nowhere's Quarter.

02:48:57.570 --> 02:48:58.510
SAM: The training ground?

02:48:58.510 --> 02:48:59.343
MATT: Yes.

02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:02.073
Continuing on the southern, southeastern
side of this main street,

02:49:02.073 --> 02:49:05.698
Continuing on the southern, southeastern
side of this main street,

02:49:05.698 --> 02:49:08.040
this seems, as you start to walk further in,

02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.710
most of this village is built around one large circle

02:49:11.710 --> 02:49:14.310
of a main road, with a series of smaller alleyways

02:49:14.310 --> 02:49:15.840
and roads that break up the center.

02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:17.880
So the entire village is a big loop

02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:20.950
around this central road, that circles around it

02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:24.570
on the interior, matching the perimeter walls

02:49:24.570 --> 02:49:29.010
in a oval-type positioning.

02:49:29.010 --> 02:49:32.450
The back end of the wall does break away.

02:49:32.450 --> 02:49:34.770
And as you continue around the southeast side

02:49:34.770 --> 02:49:36.060
and heading more towards the north,

02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:37.960
you can see where the wall comes to an end,

02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:38.950
right at the edge of the cliff.

02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:42.430
And you can see there appears to be some signs

02:49:42.430 --> 02:49:44.740
of part of a wall that has broken off.

02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:46.960
Like some sort of erosion or impact

02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:48.540
has caused an element of the wall there

02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:50.130
to have toppled off the edge of the cliff

02:49:50.130 --> 02:49:51.680
and out of sight.

02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:53.320
You can see bits of metal bent

02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:54.940
and broken at the hinge

02:49:54.940 --> 02:49:57.140
to where that attachment once was.

02:49:57.140 --> 02:50:00.145
But you do, beyond that, see the ocean.

02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:06.330
As you get closer, you see some individuals coming

02:50:06.330 --> 02:50:09.690
with their heavy furred coats with

02:50:09.690 --> 02:50:12.160
heavy nets filled with all kinds of fish.

02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:13.537
A couple of individuals come by.

02:50:13.537 --> 02:50:16.988
You see this tall, elven, lanky elven gentlemen,

02:50:16.988 --> 02:50:20.440
carrying two wooden crates

02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:21.790
in each hand and as they come by,

02:50:21.790 --> 02:50:24.130
you can see these large crustaceans within

02:50:24.130 --> 02:50:25.480
that are currently clattering

02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:26.773
and moving about within.

02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:29.830
You see where they're coming from.

02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:34.320
There is a large switchback staircase

02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:36.690
that emerges from the edge of the seaside cliff,

02:50:36.690 --> 02:50:39.410
and then heads down along its length

02:50:39.410 --> 02:50:41.530
out of sight to an area below.

02:50:41.530 --> 02:50:42.610
And as you begin to approach that

02:50:42.610 --> 02:50:47.480
you can see a modest series of docks.

02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:50.920
About maybe 50, 60 feet from the edge of this cliff

02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:54.883
to where the shore actually meets the icy waters below.

02:50:57.160 --> 02:50:59.109
LAURA: Lead the way, Fjord.

02:51:00.517 --> 02:51:01.554
TRAVIS: This way.

02:51:01.554 --> 02:51:02.727
(laughter)

02:51:02.727 --> 02:51:04.540
MATT: "Very astute of you, Captain."

02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:06.602
SAM: He knows everything about the ocean!

02:51:06.602 --> 02:51:08.280
LAURA: He really does.

02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:10.630
MATT: Heading down towards the docks below.

02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:14.563
You can see the winding walkway

02:51:14.563 --> 02:51:18.140
eventually comes down to this sand/snow beach.

02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:21.140
And there upon that area where they meet

02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:24.930
where a number of large rocks emerge from the surf,

02:51:24.930 --> 02:51:29.640
these heavy wooden docks press out 20, 30,

02:51:29.640 --> 02:51:32.455
some even 60 feet out into the open water.

02:51:33.430 --> 02:51:35.750
Rickety at first glance, but functional,

02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:38.000
at least enough to still be here and working.

02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:41.980
You can see about six vessels of varying size

02:51:41.980 --> 02:51:45.100
that are currently docked at the moment.

02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:47.540
A handful of icy ocean fishing vessels,

02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:50.050
looks like two reinforced cargo ships,

02:51:50.050 --> 02:51:51.690
a singular large icebreaker ship

02:51:51.690 --> 02:51:53.110
that's fitted with armaments.

02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:57.310
And you can see a dock house

02:51:57.310 --> 02:52:01.330
that sits to the western side of the docks,

02:52:01.330 --> 02:52:04.240
that two individuals right now are in the process

02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:07.058
of a conversation or argument, you can't quite tell.

02:52:07.058 --> 02:52:09.370
TRAVIS: How many of the ships look like icebreaker ships?

02:52:09.370 --> 02:52:11.030
MATT: There's one icebreaker ship.

02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.863
TRAVIS: We want that one, right?

02:52:11.863 --> 02:52:13.000
MATT: An icebreaker's--

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.190
to signify, the other ships are--

02:52:16.190 --> 02:52:19.900
The cargo ships are built pretty heartily

02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:22.850
and have some similarities to the icebreaker ship

02:52:24.250 --> 02:52:27.840
in how the bow is a little wider

02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:30.120
and has pointed edges that are meant to hit

02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:35.000
and break through surface ice and thin glacial islands

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.490
that they may meet here in the icy waters.

02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:39.380
The fishing vessels are not fitted that way,

02:52:39.380 --> 02:52:41.220
and you gather probably don't travel too far

02:52:41.220 --> 02:52:44.423
from this bank and just fish in the nearby waters.

02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:47.820
The icebreaker is a massive ship

02:52:47.820 --> 02:52:51.510
and the exterior of it is reinforced with iron

02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:53.700
or some sort of a heavier, darker metal.

02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:57.220
And you can see it comes to a very pronounced point

02:52:57.220 --> 02:52:59.962
that is edged outward and disappears beneath the surface

02:52:59.962 --> 02:53:02.490
of the water in front of it, meant to wedge and break

02:53:02.490 --> 02:53:03.950
any heavy ice banks that hit it

02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:05.220
while it's on its way there.

02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:07.170
LAURA: Yeah, let's get that one, that's cool.

02:53:07.170 --> 02:53:08.913
SAM: Fjord, you sure you can handle

02:53:08.913 --> 02:53:10.460
a big piece of equipment like that?

02:53:10.460 --> 02:53:11.854
TRAVIS: No idea.

02:53:12.930 --> 02:53:14.478
Be fun to find out, though, won't it?

02:53:14.478 --> 02:53:15.327
SAM: All right.

02:53:15.327 --> 02:53:17.069
LIAM: We're a long way from Zadash.

02:53:19.350 --> 02:53:22.040
MATT: So, Vess goes,

02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:24.220
"Well, if we are to acquire passage,

02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:27.180
"I'll go ahead and speak with the dock master."

02:53:27.180 --> 02:53:29.320
She begins to make her way towards the dock house.

02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:31.240
You can wait here or you can go with.

02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:34.380
LAURA: I'm going to make a snowman while I wait.

02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:35.640
MATT: Okay.

02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:36.763
You have

02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:41.130
not a whole lot of time, but you work pretty quick.

02:53:41.130 --> 02:53:42.570
It would be a small snowman,

02:53:42.570 --> 02:53:44.743
but you make one nevertheless pretty easily.

02:53:46.570 --> 02:53:51.140
Before Vess returns with a rolled up piece of parchment

02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:53.690
and goes, "Very well.

02:53:53.690 --> 02:53:56.460
"Since you have requested the icebreaker,

02:53:56.460 --> 02:53:57.980
"it looks like we have bought passage

02:53:57.980 --> 02:54:00.068
"on top of the Midnight Hammer."

02:54:00.068 --> 02:54:01.960
ALL: Ooh.

02:54:01.960 --> 02:54:04.504
LAURA: The Midnight Hannah, that sounds fabulous.

02:54:04.504 --> 02:54:05.483
MATT: "No, Hammer."

02:54:05.483 --> 02:54:06.720
LIAM: Hammer.
TRAVIS: Hammer?

02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:09.003
LAURA: The Midnight Hammer sounds even better!

02:54:09.930 --> 02:54:11.440
I'm going to put a teeny little dick

02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.690
on my teeny little snowman.

02:54:15.570 --> 02:54:16.850
MATT: Heading towards the edge of the dock

02:54:16.850 --> 02:54:19.840
and onto the gangplank that puts

02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:21.250
onto the actual deck of the ship.

02:54:21.250 --> 02:54:22.230
As you begin to step, you can see

02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:24.100
one of the sailors on the ship,

02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:25.330
all heavily bundled up,

02:54:25.330 --> 02:54:28.860
this rough and tumble-looking,

02:54:28.860 --> 02:54:32.220
very dark-skinned dwarf with a deep red beard

02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:34.377
glances over beneath his cap with the fur flaps on the side,

02:54:34.377 --> 02:54:39.357
and he goes, "Hey, hey, what's your business here?"

02:54:39.357 --> 02:54:43.010
And Vess hands the materials over to him,

02:54:43.010 --> 02:54:46.066
he looks at, "Hey, Captain?

02:54:46.066 --> 02:54:47.432
"Captain?"

02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:52.700
Brief time passes before stepping up to alongside

02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:57.420
you see a male elf, tall, but portly,

02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:58.760
a heavier midsection

02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:03.363
with this red and graying chinstrap beard.

02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:07.930
You're not used to seeing elves with facial hair,

02:55:07.930 --> 02:55:10.550
Half-elves usually, but elves, normally,

02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:12.410
to grow a beard this thick is impressive.

02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:14.120
But with your time you spent at Uthodurn

02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:17.160
you do know that there are elves

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:18.840
with some hints of dwarvish blood

02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:20.140
and dwarves with elvish blood,

02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:23.610
and you can definitely see a pronounced dwarvish heritage

02:55:23.610 --> 02:55:26.250
displaying itself within this elf individual.

02:55:26.250 --> 02:55:29.530
His posture is a bit odd and off,

02:55:29.530 --> 02:55:31.090
how his shoulders slink forward

02:55:31.090 --> 02:55:35.420
and his tall self seems to sit in this S formation

02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:36.733
from a sideways angle.

02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:39.490
His hair on top is slicked back

02:55:39.490 --> 02:55:41.140
and has been wetted, and you can tell that

02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:42.350
because there are elements of ice

02:55:42.350 --> 02:55:43.810
that have gathered at certain edges

02:55:43.810 --> 02:55:46.240
where it seems to have frozen to the side of his head.

02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:49.010
He has a wooden carved pipe

02:55:49.010 --> 02:55:50.850
that rests out of one corner of his mouth,

02:55:50.850 --> 02:55:53.070
with a lazy drift of smoke.

02:55:53.070 --> 02:55:54.310
And he has these thick eyebrows

02:55:54.310 --> 02:55:56.470
that currently look furrowed as he steps forth

02:55:56.470 --> 02:55:58.783
and takes this sheet of paper and looks at it over and goes,

02:56:02.030 --> 02:56:04.840
"Ah, right. So you've bought your way here

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.686
"to ride on the Midnight Hammer. Is that right?"

02:56:07.686 --> 02:56:09.610
LAURA and TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:56:09.610 --> 02:56:12.283
MATT: "Okay, step on. We leave before nightfall."

02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:15.170
SAM: Who are you?

02:56:15.170 --> 02:56:17.972
MATT: "Me? Captain Kem Liard."

02:56:17.972 --> 02:56:18.805
LIAM: Kem Liard?

02:56:18.805 --> 02:56:19.638
SAM: Kem Liard.

02:56:19.638 --> 02:56:21.453
TRAVIS: Kem Liard?

02:56:21.453 --> 02:56:24.790
And, how would you spell your name, Captain?

02:56:24.790 --> 02:56:26.305
MATT: "K-E-M.

02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:29.563
"L-I-A-R-D."

02:56:30.700 --> 02:56:32.960
LAURA: Oh yeah, Kem Liard, obviously.

02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:33.910
TALIESIN: I was very close.

02:56:36.100 --> 02:56:39.415
SAM: Any rules we should know
about on your ship, Captain Kem?

02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:44.090
MATT: "Well, namely don't touch nothing that's not yours,

02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:45.593
"stay away from the edges,

02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:48.733
"and keeping warm is your own business.

02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:51.413
"Keeping fed is your own business.

02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:54.190
"Get your supplies before you leave.

02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:57.513
"That's about it."

02:56:57.513 --> 02:56:58.753
SAM: And have fun!

02:56:59.936 --> 02:57:01.683
MATT: "That's entirely up to you."

02:57:01.683 --> 02:57:02.516
SAM: Okay.

02:57:02.516 --> 02:57:06.226
TRAVIS: Captain, how long is the journey to Balenpost?

02:57:06.226 --> 02:57:07.973
MATT: "Well we're heading to--" and you see,

02:57:07.973 --> 02:57:10.123
Vess goes and points to the paper and goes,

02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:16.727
"Balenpost it is!

02:57:16.727 --> 02:57:18.053
"Balenpost it is.

02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:21.380
"That'll be, depending on the weather,

02:57:21.380 --> 02:57:23.393
"anywhere between seven to twelve days.

02:57:24.970 --> 02:57:26.610
"It's a roundabout journey,

02:57:26.610 --> 02:57:28.500
"but it's better than going

02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:31.263
"through the southern waters there, bit dangerous.

02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:36.496
"So, get supplies, for our trip is long!"

02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:38.740
LIAM: How big is your crew?

02:57:38.740 --> 02:57:40.620
MATT: "Our crew is 10. Tenfold."

02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:45.620
LIAM: 10 plus us, so that's nine of us plus Ms. DeRogna.

02:57:45.639 --> 02:57:47.390
TRAVIS: What would you say is the most common danger

02:57:47.390 --> 02:57:49.553
encountered on the seas this far north?

02:57:50.490 --> 02:57:53.663
MATT: "Terrible weather, thick ice sheets,

02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:57.810
"mysterious fogs, water beasts."

02:57:57.810 --> 02:57:59.382
TRAVIS: Water beasts?

02:57:59.382 --> 02:58:00.980
LAURA: Like dragon turtles?

02:58:00.980 --> 02:58:02.876
MATT: "Oh, I certainly hope we don't encounter one of those.

02:58:02.876 --> 02:58:04.726
"I haven't seen one about these parts."

02:58:06.438 --> 02:58:09.120
LAURA: What kind of water beasts, then?

02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:11.420
TRAVIS: Anything that makes it's way onto your ship?

02:58:13.010 --> 02:58:14.810
MATT: "Generally no, but we got those to take care of them,"

02:58:14.810 --> 02:58:15.643
and he points over you can see

02:58:15.643 --> 02:58:17.700
there's these heavy pieces of cloth,

02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:20.740
like tarps that are thrown over three elements

02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:23.080
on the dock itself.

02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:26.110
And he glances over, you can see one of the crew members

02:58:26.110 --> 02:58:28.330
is currently underneath and checking something.

02:58:28.330 --> 02:58:30.290
And they pull it off and as they do

02:58:30.290 --> 02:58:33.400
you can see this massive ballista

02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:35.820
that is affixed to the top of the deck.

02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:38.520
One of three, it looks like.

02:58:38.520 --> 02:58:41.306
The front of it, you can see it has

02:58:41.306 --> 02:58:44.580
a unique mixture of both elven and dwarven--

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:47.310
it has that thickness of dwarven build,

02:58:47.310 --> 02:58:49.883
but it has elegant runes and,

02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:53.290
you can gather some sort of enchantment

02:58:53.290 --> 02:58:54.873
built into the ballista.

02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:58.970
And you can see next to the ground next to it,

02:58:58.970 --> 02:59:01.330
there is a heavy metal case

02:59:01.330 --> 02:59:03.790
that contains, even at first glance,

02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:08.730
maybe two dozen of these four-foot long metal bolts

02:59:08.730 --> 02:59:12.120
that have these jagged arrow points at the front

02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:16.530
and a blunt base at the back

02:59:16.530 --> 02:59:19.750
for the ballista to catch and thrust forward with.

02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:21.050
LAURA: Wow.
ASHLEY: Cool.

02:59:21.050 --> 02:59:23.220
MATT: "So if any sort of beasts come on here,

02:59:23.220 --> 02:59:25.990
"we got a few here have had some experience,

02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:26.983
"nothing too crazy."

02:59:28.770 --> 02:59:31.170
TRAVIS: Well, we are at your disposal if you need anything.

02:59:31.170 --> 02:59:33.200
Some of us are quite experienced ourselves,

02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:35.170
but we will stay out of your way, Captain,

02:59:35.170 --> 02:59:36.423
unless you require us.

02:59:37.530 --> 02:59:40.700
MATT: "Well, if you hear me shouting, come and help,

02:59:40.700 --> 02:59:42.533
"just don't get in the way.

02:59:45.390 --> 02:59:46.223
"Okay?"

02:59:46.223 --> 02:59:49.180
TRAVIS: Do we need to gather food and supplies

02:59:49.180 --> 02:59:51.043
for our trip, or are you good?

02:59:52.930 --> 02:59:54.119
TALIESIN: Do we have enough?
LAURA: I have a lot of pastries

02:59:54.119 --> 02:59:54.952
for us.

02:59:56.120 --> 02:59:59.100
TALIESIN: Do we need to pick up any-- do we have food?

02:59:59.100 --> 03:00:01.255
TRAVIS: You can do the thing where you--
TALIESIN: Do we have some rations, or?

03:00:01.255 --> 03:00:03.600
MARISHA: I don't know, we're all looking at you.

03:00:03.600 --> 03:00:05.125
Do we have food? Do we have rations?

03:00:05.125 --> 03:00:06.667
TALIESIN: We have some. If you want something tasty,

03:00:06.667 --> 03:00:08.280
I'm sure we can pick up some meat

03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:09.810
and some pickles while we're here,

03:00:09.810 --> 03:00:12.360
I imagine they sell that thing.
LAURA: Yeah, maybe pickles would be smart idea.

03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:15.440
MATT: Yeah, even walking through, you spotted a few places

03:00:15.440 --> 03:00:20.150
that sold dried meats, fresh fish,

03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:24.350
all sorts of basic rations.

03:00:24.350 --> 03:00:28.210
You know, meal-based breads and heavy oats.

03:00:28.210 --> 03:00:31.040
TALIESIN: Get ourselves a couple of weeks worth of goodness.

03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:32.810
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:32.810 --> 03:00:33.820
MATT: It's a little pricier up here

03:00:33.820 --> 03:00:35.790
because of the remoteness of it,

03:00:35.790 --> 03:00:37.290
but if you're looking to buy yourself

03:00:37.290 --> 03:00:42.193
two weeks worth of serviceable rations for each of you.

03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:46.700
Let's see here, I'd put it at about...

03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:54.792
SAM: 15,000 gold.

03:00:54.792 --> 03:00:56.650
(laughter)

03:00:56.650 --> 03:00:57.840
MATT: About 10 gold a piece.

03:00:57.840 --> 03:00:59.220
LAURA: Wha?!
TALIESIN: 10 gold, for?

03:00:59.220 --> 03:01:00.861
MATT: For two weeks worth of

03:01:00.861 --> 03:01:03.411
serviceable, modest rations.
MARISHA: Import costs are no joke.

03:01:03.411 --> 03:01:04.720
TRAVIS: Let's do it duty free, baby.

03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:06.620
MARISHA: Yeah (laughs).

03:01:06.620 --> 03:01:10.368
SAM: I'll pay for you and you.

03:01:10.368 --> 03:01:11.201
LAURA: What?

03:01:11.201 --> 03:01:12.990
SAM: Aren't you-- don't you have nothing left?

03:01:12.990 --> 03:01:14.706
MATT: You can take half that cost if you want to,

03:01:14.706 --> 03:01:16.672
if you just take fish.

03:01:16.672 --> 03:01:18.200
MARISHA: Nah, nah, no.

03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:19.910
SAM: I want to live it up.

03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:22.012
MATT: Everything else is imported from Uthodurn to here

03:01:22.012 --> 03:01:23.310
so the prices are a lot higher.

03:01:23.310 --> 03:01:25.151
LIAM: I also have all these boba.

03:01:25.151 --> 03:01:26.450
And I hold up a glass jar

03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:27.480
of nourishments.
MATT: It's true, you do have that.

03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:30.130
TALIESIN: I have tea. Between the
two of us, we should be fine.

03:01:30.130 --> 03:01:31.241
MARISHA: It's like food on New Zealand.

03:01:31.241 --> 03:01:33.947
ASHLEY: I'll get the food.

03:01:33.947 --> 03:01:35.837
LAURA: What?
TRAVIS: Like, for everybody?

03:01:35.837 --> 03:01:36.670
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:01:36.670 --> 03:01:39.060
LAURA: It's 10 gold per person, Yasha.

03:01:39.060 --> 03:01:43.100
ASHLEY: Yeah, but, I mean, I have money.

03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:44.380
What else am I going to do with it?

03:01:44.380 --> 03:01:46.720
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
ASHLEY: We have to eat!

03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:49.980
LAURA: You guys, everyone is so generous and wonderful

03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:52.176
and I'm just so proud of us all.

03:01:53.450 --> 03:01:54.447
TALIESIN: I thought Beau was nice,

03:01:54.447 --> 03:01:56.730
but, like, you're really nice.
SAM: Yeah, that's nice check-in.

03:01:56.730 --> 03:01:57.700
That's nice.

03:01:57.700 --> 03:02:00.230
TALIESIN: Beau is nice, but that's super nice.

03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:02.863
ASHLEY: Well, it's all, it all works.

03:02:02.863 --> 03:02:04.570
SAM: It's true.
TALIESIN: I'm kidding ya, yeah.

03:02:04.570 --> 03:02:05.403
You're nice, too.

03:02:05.403 --> 03:02:07.230
SAM: It's true, if I had to pick the two nicest members

03:02:07.230 --> 03:02:09.130
of the Mighty Nein, it would be Yasha and Beau.

03:02:09.130 --> 03:02:10.414
TALIESIN: Right there.

03:02:10.414 --> 03:02:11.943
ASHLEY: I don't know if that's all true, but, I mean.

03:02:11.943 --> 03:02:13.560
MARISHA: I think that's pretty true.

03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:15.860
ASHLEY: Yeah?
MARISHA: That's very accurate, yeah.

03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:16.693
Thank you.

03:02:17.530 --> 03:02:18.363
Thank you.

03:02:18.363 --> 03:02:20.200
Thanks, Caduceus, thanks.
TALIESIN: Ah, you're welcome.

03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:21.224
LAURA: Thank you, Yasha.

03:02:21.224 --> 03:02:23.407
SAM: Thank you, guys. Thank you, Fjord.

03:02:23.407 --> 03:02:24.920
MARISHA: Thank you, Veth.

03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:26.080
Thank you, Caleb.

03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:27.120
LAURA: Thank you, Caduceus.

03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:28.290
ASHLEY: Are we doing a circle--
TALIESIN: Thank you, Jester.

03:02:28.290 --> 03:02:30.479
ASHLEY: -- where we say what we're thankful for?
LIAM: Good night, Ma.

03:02:30.479 --> 03:02:32.562
Is that what's happening?
LIAM: Good night, Pa.

03:02:33.793 --> 03:02:35.631
Ooh, that's weird, coming from me.

03:02:35.631 --> 03:02:38.180
(laughter)

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:39.980
LAURA: I'm going to make lots more snowmen

03:02:39.980 --> 03:02:41.853
while we're here waiting to leave.

03:02:42.750 --> 03:02:44.690
With little dicks on all of them.

03:02:44.690 --> 03:02:45.523
MATT: Okay, very well.

03:02:45.523 --> 03:02:47.473
LAURA: All around town, wherever we go.

03:02:47.473 --> 03:02:50.323
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Tiny snowman, big dick.

03:02:50.323 --> 03:02:51.770
Big snowman, little dick.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:51.770 --> 03:02:52.760
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:54.600
MATT: Just for variety's sake.

03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:56.118
TALIESIN: Three, five.

03:02:57.310 --> 03:03:00.630
MATT: You do begin to gather a small crowd of Glassblades

03:03:00.630 --> 03:03:02.930
that at first are just following out of suspicion

03:03:02.930 --> 03:03:05.840
and then eventually start just following out of amusement

03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:08.950
for all the varying artistic representations

03:03:08.950 --> 03:03:10.750
you're creating in the surrounding snow.

03:03:10.750 --> 03:03:11.930
LAURA: Nice.

03:03:11.930 --> 03:03:13.980
SAM: We can't get where we're going by magical means

03:03:13.980 --> 03:03:17.220
because it is somehow isolated or sealed off?

03:03:17.220 --> 03:03:18.303
TALIESIN: That's weird.

03:03:18.303 --> 03:03:21.250
MARISHA: I was about to ask, am I being impatient if...

03:03:22.150 --> 03:03:24.430
We figure out if we can--
TRAVIS: Icebreaker ship!

03:03:24.430 --> 03:03:26.450
MARISHA: But it's so slow!
TRAVIS: You shut up with your magic!

03:03:26.450 --> 03:03:28.338
LAURA: She said it's hard to bamf there.
She said it's dangerous.

03:03:28.338 --> 03:03:30.239
LIAM: Yes, the magic is screwy there.

03:03:30.239 --> 03:03:31.072
TALIESIN: Magic is weird.

03:03:31.072 --> 03:03:34.520
MATT: It's possible, but it's risky.

03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:35.800
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Also, icebreaker!

03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:37.400
LIAM: Merging with a glacier.

03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:38.910
SAM: All right, icebreaker ship. Let's go.

03:03:38.910 --> 03:03:41.470
TALIESIN: I'm here for icebreaker.
MARISHA: Icebreaker ship, all right.

03:03:41.470 --> 03:03:43.920
LIAM: Ice Road Truckers, let's do this!
MARISHA: Alaskan cruises.

03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:47.570
TRAVIS: Captain Liard, we should ask who your first mate is,

03:03:47.570 --> 03:03:50.750
in case we need to just follow your chain of command.

03:03:50.750 --> 03:03:53.118
MATT: "Oh well, that would be a Ruega."

03:03:53.118 --> 03:03:54.150
TRAVIS: Ruega?

03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:55.960
MATT: "Ruega Timbercall."

03:03:55.960 --> 03:03:57.978
LIAM: Ruega Timbercall.
TRAVIS: Ruega Timbercall,

03:03:57.978 --> 03:04:00.777
and what do they look like?

03:04:00.777 --> 03:04:02.672
MATT: "Well, let me introduce you.

03:04:02.672 --> 03:04:03.779
"Ruega?"

03:04:03.779 --> 03:04:05.880
And he looks over and you see this

03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:08.710
stout, burly,

03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:11.380
fucking tough as nails dwarf woman,

03:04:11.380 --> 03:04:14.320
with tattoos all up both arms.

03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:16.060
Sleeveless in the freezing cold,

03:04:16.060 --> 03:04:18.170
except for a couple of bracers

03:04:18.170 --> 03:04:22.763
on thick furred leather vest over the front of her torso.

03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:26.630
You can see her whitish hair

03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:29.630
is pulled into this really, really, really tight bun

03:04:29.630 --> 03:04:32.700
behind and it's shaved underneath, the sides.

03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:34.780
You can see there's a bit of these gray whiskers

03:04:34.780 --> 03:04:36.530
that are gathered to the front of her chin

03:04:36.530 --> 03:04:39.630
that come down into this twisted knot

03:04:39.630 --> 03:04:42.310
that seems to be gelled or glued

03:04:42.310 --> 03:04:46.150
with some sort of substance to an icicle point beneath.

03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:50.000
And she comes up and goes, "Hi.

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:50.900
"You called for me?"

03:04:51.930 --> 03:04:54.500
TRAVIS: Yes, we'll be passengers on your ship.

03:04:54.500 --> 03:04:55.333
We're just letting you know

03:04:55.333 --> 03:04:57.640
we'll make ourselves available to you if you need.

03:04:58.546 --> 03:04:59.796
MATT: "Good to know.

03:05:02.540 --> 03:05:03.490
"Can you tie a rope?"

03:05:04.780 --> 03:05:06.330
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, we can.

03:05:06.330 --> 03:05:08.630
TRAVIS: Yes, in fact, a few of us can.

03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:10.670
MATT: "Can you clean a deck?"

03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:12.750
TRAVIS: Almost all of us can do that.

03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:13.920
MATT: "Good.

03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:16.070
"Because I'm going to put you to work."

03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:17.095
TRAVIS: Sounds fair.

03:05:18.190 --> 03:05:19.390
I'm sure it's a lost sentiment,

03:05:19.390 --> 03:05:22.710
but wishing you calm seas ahead.

03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:24.660
MATT: "Calm seas indeed. (spits)"

03:05:24.660 --> 03:05:26.398
She spits and like, (crackles)

03:05:26.398 --> 03:05:27.920
and it flash freezes on the deck.

03:05:27.920 --> 03:05:29.850
LAURA: Oh wow.

03:05:29.850 --> 03:05:31.110
It's really cold here, you guys.

03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:34.776
LIAM: Yeah, I wrap my scarf
several more times around my head.

03:05:34.776 --> 03:05:35.990
I'm like this now.

03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:37.332
ASHLEY: I love it.

03:05:37.332 --> 03:05:38.632
LAURA: Yeah, it's nice.

03:05:38.632 --> 03:05:40.630
MATT: "Is that all you need, Captain?"

03:05:40.630 --> 03:05:41.580
(as Kem) "Aye-aye, don't worry.

03:05:41.580 --> 03:05:43.570
"We're just getting ready to leave here

03:05:43.570 --> 03:05:44.645
"in a few hours.

03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:49.160
"And be nice; these folks have paid quite a handsome sum

03:05:49.160 --> 03:05:50.223
"to travel with us."

03:05:52.255 --> 03:05:53.088
(as Ruega) "'Kay."

03:05:54.876 --> 03:05:56.437
And she just walks away.

03:05:56.437 --> 03:05:58.680
LAURA: Bye, Ruega.

03:05:58.680 --> 03:05:59.930
TRAVIS: Can I find Vess and just say:

03:05:59.930 --> 03:06:02.400
Just out of curiosity, how much did you drop

03:06:02.400 --> 03:06:04.393
on this particular voyage?

03:06:05.570 --> 03:06:08.086
MATT: "Well, the Assembly

03:06:08.086 --> 03:06:11.470
"has access to general coffers

03:06:11.470 --> 03:06:12.710
"for purposes such as this,

03:06:12.710 --> 03:06:15.790
"research and otherwise, interests internally.

03:06:15.790 --> 03:06:20.790
"I figured a 250 gold passage fee is more than sufficient

03:06:21.580 --> 03:06:23.880
"to get acquisition of the ship immediately

03:06:23.880 --> 03:06:26.653
"and to shift their intended destination."

03:06:27.633 --> 03:06:29.577
TRAVIS: Did they mention where they were headed?

03:06:29.577 --> 03:06:31.248
MATT: "I did not ask, I did not care."

03:06:31.248 --> 03:06:32.473
TRAVIS: Sounds very fair.

03:06:34.320 --> 03:06:37.260
MATT: "Nevertheless, I'm going to go choose my quarters."

03:06:37.260 --> 03:06:38.910
And she makes her way below deck.

03:06:39.870 --> 03:06:41.140
TRAVIS: Oh, right, our quarters.

03:06:41.140 --> 03:06:42.421
Do we want to choose our quarters?

03:06:42.421 --> 03:06:44.238
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Go choose our quarters.
TALIESIN: I'd love to put this down.

03:06:44.238 --> 03:06:45.214
Yeah.

03:06:45.214 --> 03:06:46.047
MATT: Okay.

03:06:47.770 --> 03:06:49.250
Interesting to note,

03:06:49.250 --> 03:06:50.980
the quarters below,

03:06:50.980 --> 03:06:55.130
with the 10 or so crew here.

03:06:55.130 --> 03:06:58.390
There are bunker chambers for them.

03:06:58.390 --> 03:07:02.600
Many of which contain four, five, makeshift beds

03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:05.690
in insulated chambers below the deck.

03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:07.090
There are three of them.

03:07:07.090 --> 03:07:09.500
As far as chambers for you all,

03:07:09.500 --> 03:07:11.417
it's mainly just cargo space. (chuckles)

03:07:11.417 --> 03:07:12.840
SAM: Oh no!
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:15.638
MATT: This is not a travel vessel.

03:07:15.638 --> 03:07:18.661
TRAVIS: What does the dome do against weather?

03:07:19.740 --> 03:07:21.760
LIAM: It's very comfortable inside the dome.

03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:22.940
TRAVIS: So it can be freezing outside--

03:07:22.940 --> 03:07:25.840
SAM: Wait, we have a mansion, we have a tower.

03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:27.530
MARISHA: Yeah, can we do the mansion over these days?

03:07:27.530 --> 03:07:29.400
LAURA: The ship is moving.

03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:30.957
Does the tower stay where it is?

03:07:30.957 --> 03:07:32.524
SAM: No, it comes with!

03:07:32.524 --> 03:07:33.770
Right? I don't know.

03:07:33.770 --> 03:07:35.576
LIAM: You tell me, Scan-man.

03:07:35.576 --> 03:07:36.409
TALIESIN: How long is the frame?

03:07:36.409 --> 03:07:39.230
SAM: From what I've read---

03:07:39.230 --> 03:07:41.900
MARISHA: Yeah, if the frame is rooted on the ship, right?

03:07:41.900 --> 03:07:43.512
SAM: That is a good question!

03:07:43.512 --> 03:07:46.960
MATT: I consider it relatively anchored

03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:49.650
to the location it is placed.

03:07:49.650 --> 03:07:52.560
Meaning, if you were to cast it on a moving vessel,

03:07:52.560 --> 03:07:55.270
it would stay anchored to the vessel that is moving.

03:07:55.270 --> 03:07:56.529
LIAM: Where I jam the wand?

03:07:56.529 --> 03:07:58.050
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

03:07:58.050 --> 03:07:59.980
TRAVIS: It goes without saying that at night,

03:07:59.980 --> 03:08:02.930
the hull of this ship, in saltwater below freezing

03:08:02.930 --> 03:08:06.290
is going to be very, very cold.

03:08:06.290 --> 03:08:08.760
SAM: But we're going to be wrapped up in cat blankets

03:08:08.760 --> 03:08:10.087
so we'll be fine.

03:08:10.087 --> 03:08:11.917
TRAVIS: (sneezes)

03:08:11.917 --> 03:08:13.090
MATT: As you do go below deck,

03:08:13.090 --> 03:08:14.240
it is warmer below the deck.

03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:16.140
The ship is insulated for that purpose.

03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:19.080
It's still chilly, it's not the most comfortable interior,

03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:23.690
but it is designed to keep the crew

03:08:23.690 --> 03:08:26.920
from freezing to death after many, many nights at sea.

03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:28.544
MARISHA: Mansion, mansion, mansion!

03:08:28.544 --> 03:08:30.730
LIAM: Well, there is the interesting hypothetical,

03:08:30.730 --> 03:08:34.013
if there is some sort of sea beast, as we were warned,

03:08:34.013 --> 03:08:38.333
and the ship goes under, and we step out of the door,

03:08:40.160 --> 03:08:42.531
a mile under the ocean, that would be bad.

03:08:42.531 --> 03:08:43.439
(laughter)

03:08:43.439 --> 03:08:45.035
LAURA: Fjord can cast Water Breathing.

03:08:45.035 --> 03:08:47.635
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can breathe underwater.

03:08:47.635 --> 03:08:49.950
However, I do think you'll expire

03:08:49.950 --> 03:08:51.270
in less than seven minutes.

03:08:51.270 --> 03:08:53.615
TALIESIN: Oh, also, I can cast the thing that makes you--

03:08:53.615 --> 03:08:55.280
you'll just shoot right up to the surface.

03:08:55.280 --> 03:08:56.802
I've got that spell.
TRAVIS: Sure, it's just

03:08:56.802 --> 03:08:58.242
you're still in the water at that point.

03:08:58.242 --> 03:09:00.380
MARISHA: It just sounds like a challenge to me.

03:09:00.380 --> 03:09:02.550
I'm here for it.
SAM: Feel like we could survive.

03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:04.980
MARISHA: Yeah, we could totally...
TALIESIN: I feel like there's a plan.

03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:09.500
LAURA: We have ways to bamf both of us to Nicodranas,

03:09:09.500 --> 03:09:12.675
worst case scenario, so we're fine.

03:09:12.675 --> 03:09:14.343
ASHLEY: Sounds like a win-win.
SAM: We're fine!

03:09:14.343 --> 03:09:16.918
TRAVIS: We got dry suits on this bitch, right? We're fine!

03:09:16.918 --> 03:09:18.730
It's no big deal.

03:09:18.730 --> 03:09:20.439
MARISHA: (laughs)
SAM: All right.

03:09:20.439 --> 03:09:21.272
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:27.160
SAM: Well, we'll pick some sort of quarters area

03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:29.040
to give it the appearance

03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:31.510
that we're going to be sleeping in the place.

03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:33.920
MATT: Now, because they're not bringing any heavy cargo,

03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:36.300
there's a lot of open space beneath the deck here.

03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:38.640
So it's very, very easy for you guys to carve out

03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:42.280
a section of the hold beneath for you

03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:44.220
with plenty of room.

03:09:44.220 --> 03:09:45.053
SAM: Cool.

03:09:45.053 --> 03:09:46.260
MATT: And you can even bring over some cots

03:09:46.260 --> 03:09:49.171
and various other benches and make a makeshift space

03:09:49.171 --> 03:09:53.050
to sit and like have a table and a living space

03:09:53.050 --> 03:09:54.540
if you wanted so below the deck.

03:09:54.540 --> 03:09:56.364
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to shimmy some--
TALIESIN: Set up some coat hangers.

03:09:56.364 --> 03:09:59.400
LAURA: -- crates around so that it like makes a little wall

03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:01.080
so we have some privacy.

03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:02.900
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

03:10:02.900 --> 03:10:03.850
LAURA: Yeah.

03:10:03.850 --> 03:10:04.683
MATT: All right.

03:10:05.710 --> 03:10:09.830
As the night grows darker and darker,

03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:13.830
pushing itself towards the oncoming dusk,

03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:17.310
the bells begin to go off around the ship.

03:10:17.310 --> 03:10:18.500
Ding, ding.

03:10:18.500 --> 03:10:19.620
Ding, ding.

03:10:19.620 --> 03:10:20.950
Ding, ding.

03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:24.370
As that happens, the gangplank is lifted up onto the ship,

03:10:24.370 --> 03:10:27.363
the anchors are pulled up.

03:10:28.230 --> 03:10:33.020
You didn't really see any sails on this.

03:10:33.020 --> 03:10:35.301
You saw a couple of poles up there,

03:10:35.301 --> 03:10:38.010
it looked like they had what would be sails almost,

03:10:38.010 --> 03:10:40.160
but there were no actual pieces of material

03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:41.490
hanging from them.

03:10:41.490 --> 03:10:44.903
The ship (booms) lurches forward suddenly.

03:10:44.903 --> 03:10:45.736
SAM: Ooh.

03:10:46.969 --> 03:10:48.990
LAURA: Ooh, can we run up and see what's going on?

03:10:48.990 --> 03:10:49.823
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:10:49.823 --> 03:10:51.370
MATT: You run up and look off to the sides

03:10:51.370 --> 03:10:52.930
and you can see water being displaced

03:10:52.930 --> 03:10:55.170
on either side of the ship.

03:10:55.170 --> 03:10:57.780
And to the back, you can see there's a heavy bit of water

03:10:57.780 --> 03:10:58.810
being kicked up.

03:10:58.810 --> 03:11:00.907
SAM: Are we being pulled by a team of dolphins?

03:11:00.907 --> 03:11:02.510
MATT: (laughs)

03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:04.460
Roll a perception check.

03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:06.302
If anybody would like to.

03:11:06.302 --> 03:11:07.246
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:07.246 --> 03:11:08.670
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:11:08.670 --> 03:11:09.587
SAM: 12 for me.

03:11:09.587 --> 03:11:10.925
TALIESIN: 30.

03:11:10.925 --> 03:11:11.758
ASHLEY: Oh!

03:11:12.890 --> 03:11:13.723
MATT: All righty.

03:11:13.723 --> 03:11:14.893
SAM: Ride, Flipper, ride!
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

03:11:14.893 --> 03:11:16.253
TALIESIN: With my new d20.

03:11:17.145 --> 03:11:19.660
MATT: You did hear this

03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:21.900
heavy whirring sound below the decks.

03:11:21.900 --> 03:11:25.340
This like (whirs) sound,

03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:26.770
and as you glance off to the side

03:11:26.770 --> 03:11:29.170
beneath the cold water,

03:11:29.170 --> 03:11:32.353
you can see some sort of a heavy metallic,

03:11:34.750 --> 03:11:37.240
a lengthy, spiraling platform

03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:41.570
beneath the water that's just, (whooshes)

03:11:41.570 --> 03:11:43.280
like massive propellers.

03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:47.830
Something, a clockwork construct

03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:51.667
that is pushing forward, with or without wind.

03:11:51.667 --> 03:11:52.500
LAURA: Wow!

03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:54.790
TRAVIS: Where is the engine, though?

03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:00.490
Can I find the captain?

03:12:00.490 --> 03:12:02.290
MATT: Yep, the captain is currently on top

03:12:02.290 --> 03:12:03.330
and is keeping an eye out there.

03:12:03.330 --> 03:12:05.930
Has a small table next to the wheel at the back

03:12:05.930 --> 03:12:08.537
and is setting a course off to the north.

03:12:08.537 --> 03:12:10.070
And as you step up to the side

03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:11.910
he's not quite paying attention to you at the moment.

03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:13.240
TRAVIS: I don't mean to disturb,

03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:15.000
I just noticed-
MATT: "Right, right?"

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:18.600
TRAVIS: Your ship has a bizarre mode of propulsion.

03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:20.730
How does it work?

03:12:20.730 --> 03:12:23.515
MATT: "Not entirely certain myself. Gnomish make."

03:12:23.515 --> 03:12:24.348
TRAVIS: Gnomish make?

03:12:24.348 --> 03:12:25.645
MATT: "Aye.

03:12:25.645 --> 03:12:28.140
"It was bequeathed to me by my father."

03:12:28.140 --> 03:12:30.440
TRAVIS: Does it require more moving parts

03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:32.900
underneath the vessel, or is it magical means?

03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:34.930
MATT: "Oh plenty, just don't go to the very, very bottom,

03:12:34.930 --> 03:12:36.730
"all sorts of danger in that space."

03:12:36.730 --> 03:12:38.330
TRAVIS: Very, very bottom of the ship?

03:12:38.330 --> 03:12:39.163
MATT: "Aye."

03:12:39.163 --> 03:12:41.830
TRAVIS: Like a compartment that we should entirely avoid?

03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:43.360
MATT: "Just if the noise getting's really loud,

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:44.920
"don't go further."

03:12:44.920 --> 03:12:46.320
TRAVIS: Right, I will make sure

03:12:46.320 --> 03:12:48.530
that everyone knows that part.

03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:50.140
Is there a door to go down there

03:12:50.140 --> 03:12:52.710
that we should know about near the bow or the stern?

03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:56.110
MATT: "If you see a door with
a sign that says Do Not Enter--"

03:12:56.110 --> 03:12:56.943
TRAVIS: That's the one?

03:12:56.943 --> 03:12:58.660
MATT: "Do not enter."
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

03:12:58.660 --> 03:13:01.770
MATT: "We've lost one curious crew member there before.

03:13:01.770 --> 03:13:02.910
"Real big mess."

03:13:02.910 --> 03:13:04.700
TRAVIS: I will head down and disperse

03:13:04.700 --> 03:13:07.300
that information to everyone.

03:13:07.300 --> 03:13:08.670
LAURA: I'll go look for the door.

03:13:08.670 --> 03:13:11.437
SAM: Do you want us to break in and find it?

03:13:11.437 --> 03:13:13.947
TRAVIS: I think that was--
TALIESIN: It does say do not enter.

03:13:13.947 --> 03:13:15.620
TRAVIS: -- the exact opposite of what the Captain said.

03:13:15.620 --> 03:13:16.970
SAM: Yeah, but I mean, come on.

03:13:16.970 --> 03:13:19.330
TRAVIS: He did say though, someone of your size

03:13:19.330 --> 03:13:21.420
is very welcome to rummage about,

03:13:21.420 --> 03:13:23.390
play, hang things up,

03:13:23.390 --> 03:13:26.340
do whatever they feel is necessary.

03:13:26.340 --> 03:13:27.953
SAM: We'll get to the bottom of this.

03:13:28.968 --> 03:13:30.140
LIAM: Middle of the ocean.

03:13:30.140 --> 03:13:32.210
TRAVIS: As we start to leave the docks,

03:13:32.210 --> 03:13:33.970
I'll head to the bow of the ship,

03:13:33.970 --> 03:13:36.990
just thinking about the last fucking time

03:13:36.990 --> 03:13:39.380
we were out on the sea and what happened.

03:13:39.380 --> 03:13:42.660
And I'll just try and clear my mind and meditate

03:13:42.660 --> 03:13:45.850
and say a silent prayer to the Wild Mother,

03:13:45.850 --> 03:13:50.840
hoping for calm seas and protection from certain eyes.

03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:51.673
MATT: Okay.

03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:56.320
There is something very comforting about the quiet

03:13:56.320 --> 03:13:57.573
this far north.

03:13:58.970 --> 03:14:02.850
It's odd at first because there is no heavy

03:14:02.850 --> 03:14:05.243
series of waves crashing against the shore.

03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:09.310
There is no sound of sea birds

03:14:09.310 --> 03:14:11.260
cawing in the sky above.

03:14:11.260 --> 03:14:13.613
The wind is relatively still and chilled.

03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:18.680
But, the quiet is peaceful.

03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:20.513
And as you close your eyes,

03:14:21.375 --> 03:14:22.740
the last thing you're seeing

03:14:22.740 --> 03:14:25.360
is that distant blue horizon.

03:14:25.360 --> 03:14:27.070
You remember the feeling

03:14:27.070 --> 03:14:29.910
of that ocean breeze on your skin

03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:32.880
and remembering all the times

03:14:32.880 --> 03:14:33.890
when you were younger,

03:14:33.890 --> 03:14:38.757
that moment when you emerge onto an open sea and the

03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:43.380
unbridled possibility that lies before you.

03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:45.380
And that feeling comes to you

03:14:45.380 --> 03:14:46.970
in this moment as well.

03:14:46.970 --> 03:14:47.803
It's comforting.

03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:53.160
As you consolidate these memories

03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:57.900
and give this prayer out to the Wild Mother,

03:14:57.900 --> 03:15:02.660
you feel that unexpected warmth of her presence come to you.

03:15:02.660 --> 03:15:04.280
The chill leaves your body

03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:07.170
and that warmth envelops

03:15:07.170 --> 03:15:09.823
the darkness behind your closed eyelids.

03:15:10.665 --> 03:15:15.040
And visions of warm horizons meet you again,

03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:18.293
of sunrises on seas you've never seen.

03:15:19.310 --> 03:15:21.623
Islands uncharted and unvisited.

03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:27.193
Ships in struggles and ocean depths below, mysteries hidden.

03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.363
And yet, it feels like home.

03:15:35.290 --> 03:15:39.443
And as her presence is there, though wordlessly,

03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:43.560
you can interpret the emotions

03:15:43.560 --> 03:15:45.973
coming from the Wild Mother here.

03:15:47.800 --> 03:15:50.103
And it feels like she's saying,

03:15:52.300 --> 03:15:55.433
"Is this the freedom you seek?"

03:15:58.520 --> 03:15:59.353
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:16:02.390 --> 03:16:05.770
MATT: "Like the waters you live upon,

03:16:05.770 --> 03:16:10.240
"and traverse, that shift and bend

03:16:12.850 --> 03:16:14.990
"and exist to move

03:16:14.990 --> 03:16:17.563
"around whatever blocks their path,

03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:20.920
"or hold stalwart against those that would wish

03:16:21.850 --> 03:16:22.733
"to defeat it.

03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:28.243
"Do you wish to be like this ocean?"

03:16:30.750 --> 03:16:31.740
TRAVIS: I can't...

03:16:32.884 --> 03:16:34.331
I can't think of a greater way

03:16:34.331 --> 03:16:37.232
to spend the rest of my days.

03:16:40.430 --> 03:16:43.483
MATT: "Do you trust the skies above?

03:16:44.700 --> 03:16:46.183
"The portents of nature?

03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:50.080
"That I may try best

03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:55.903
"to warn and keep you safe on these journeys?"

03:16:57.290 --> 03:16:58.123
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:17:01.207 --> 03:17:06.050
MATT: "And do you swear to follow this inspiration

03:17:07.140 --> 03:17:11.020
"to seek out the mysteries hidden beneath the waves

03:17:11.020 --> 03:17:13.063
"and beyond that eternal horizon?"

03:17:15.140 --> 03:17:17.763
TRAVIS: Fuck yes! (laughs)

03:17:21.350 --> 03:17:22.650
MATT: "Then your path is clear."

03:17:25.480 --> 03:17:27.780
So you take your Oath of the Open Sea.

03:17:27.780 --> 03:17:29.790
SAM: Oh! What?

03:17:29.790 --> 03:17:30.623
What's that?

03:17:30.623 --> 03:17:32.380
TRAVIS: Dope. Dope, dope, dope, dope.

03:17:32.380 --> 03:17:36.443
MATT: And that is your chosen Paladin Path.

03:17:37.453 --> 03:17:40.091
MARISHA: (chuckles)

03:17:40.091 --> 03:17:40.924
ASHLEY: Awesome!

03:17:41.972 --> 03:17:43.434
MARISHA: That was so cool!

03:17:43.434 --> 03:17:44.999
TRAVIS: That's in here?

03:17:44.999 --> 03:17:46.905
MATT: It should be.
ASHLEY: Oath of the Open Sea?

03:17:46.905 --> 03:17:47.963
SAM: What does that do?

03:17:47.963 --> 03:17:49.133
ASHLEY: That's awesome!

03:17:51.554 --> 03:17:54.670
LIAM: ♪ Yo ho, yo ho ♪

03:17:54.670 --> 03:17:55.860
MATT: So.

03:17:55.860 --> 03:17:57.890
The ship has set off.

03:17:57.890 --> 03:18:00.800
And the still waters, it's...

03:18:00.800 --> 03:18:04.210
Of all the times you've spent on the ocean,

03:18:04.210 --> 03:18:07.960
there's something weirdly eerie and peaceful

03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:10.990
about seeing just a still expanse

03:18:10.990 --> 03:18:13.423
of deep blue around you.

03:18:16.410 --> 03:18:17.430
For the first day of travel,

03:18:17.430 --> 03:18:19.613
what would you like to do, if anything at all?

03:18:22.600 --> 03:18:24.800
LIAM: I'll find four hours

03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:26.810
to kill the last of a bit of homework

03:18:26.810 --> 03:18:29.110
for a spell that I've been carrying around.

03:18:29.110 --> 03:18:31.283
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to do on this journey.

03:18:33.140 --> 03:18:34.560
SAM: I feel like you should send a message

03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:36.373
to the dragon turtle.

03:18:38.170 --> 03:18:41.150
And just be like, "Hey, we're in the ocean.

03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:42.906
"Come fucking find us."

03:18:42.906 --> 03:18:44.377
MATT: (chuckles)

03:18:44.377 --> 03:18:45.660
LAURA: That could be pretty awesome.

03:18:45.660 --> 03:18:47.723
SAM: There's no way he's going to get up here that fast.

03:18:47.723 --> 03:18:49.673
LAURA: I mean, I don't know how fast they travel.

03:18:53.010 --> 03:18:54.133
SAM: Or not, it's fine.

03:18:56.620 --> 03:18:59.090
LAURA: I'm going to wait and
I'm going to do that before bed.

03:18:59.090 --> 03:19:01.540
Just because I won't be able to keep myself from doing that.

03:19:01.540 --> 03:19:03.180
SAM: There's no way it can't get up here!

03:19:03.180 --> 03:19:06.350
It'll take weeks, months for him to get up here.

03:19:06.350 --> 03:19:07.590
ASHLEY: Should we--

03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:09.500
TRAVIS: No, not really.

03:19:09.500 --> 03:19:12.318
ASHLEY: Should we check in on Molly at some point?

03:19:12.318 --> 03:19:15.420
LAURA: I want to. I was going to Scry, if that's okay?

03:19:16.451 --> 03:19:18.600
MATT: Sure, if you'd like.
LAURA: I'd like to try to Scry on Molly again.

03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:19.580
MATT: Okay.

03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:20.700
So you find some of your space

03:19:20.700 --> 03:19:22.250
beneath the hull, in one of the private corners

03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:23.800
where nobody's really paying attention.

03:19:23.800 --> 03:19:25.550
LAURA: Behind a couple crates, you know.

03:19:31.140 --> 03:19:32.670
MATT: As you focus,

03:19:32.670 --> 03:19:36.430
your vision is pulled once more

03:19:36.430 --> 03:19:39.093
into the gray sky above.

03:19:40.970 --> 03:19:45.763
Carried through the expanse of white before you.

03:19:46.690 --> 03:19:50.783
Before your vision clarifies on the familiar,

03:19:52.760 --> 03:19:55.280
leather and fur-wrapped figure,

03:19:55.280 --> 03:19:57.860
currently sitting,

03:19:57.860 --> 03:20:00.723
in some sort of the mouth of a cavern.

03:20:02.456 --> 03:20:05.874
With a fire lit and is sitting,

03:20:05.874 --> 03:20:07.699
just staring into the flames,

03:20:07.699 --> 03:20:09.107
back against the stone wall on

03:20:09.107 --> 03:20:11.319
the inside of this little alcove,

03:20:12.466 --> 03:20:14.918
just kind of (chewing)

03:20:16.396 --> 03:20:20.396
chewing on some sort of dried jerky.

03:20:20.396 --> 03:20:21.661
LAURA: What's his posture like?

03:20:21.661 --> 03:20:23.939
Is it very different from Molly's?

03:20:24.826 --> 03:20:26.026
MATT: Make an insight check.

03:20:29.386 --> 03:20:30.839
LAURA: 15.
MATT: 15.

03:20:31.826 --> 03:20:35.689
It definitely seems more pensive and balled up.

03:20:36.636 --> 03:20:40.339
You know, you recall Molly was very out and open.

03:20:41.276 --> 03:20:44.639
This is much more huddled and contemplative.

03:20:47.568 --> 03:20:50.709
LAURA: I'm going to talk to the Traveler.

03:20:52.516 --> 03:20:54.079
He seems different, doesn't he?

03:20:55.876 --> 03:20:59.163
MATT: "From what I've seen and remember, yes, he does.

03:20:59.163 --> 03:21:02.156
"You know, death does change a person."

03:21:03.266 --> 03:21:04.099
LAURA: Yeah.

03:21:08.076 --> 03:21:10.126
I wonder if any of Molly's left in there.

03:21:12.326 --> 03:21:13.259
MATT: "Who's to say?

03:21:14.816 --> 03:21:15.874
"But, I mean,

03:21:17.226 --> 03:21:18.966
"I can't say I'm not curious, either."

03:21:18.966 --> 03:21:20.839
LAURA: I know, I really want to find out.

03:21:23.016 --> 03:21:25.507
MATT: "What's the best way to find out?"

03:21:25.507 --> 03:21:27.707
LAURA: I mean, we could just send him a message,

03:21:29.466 --> 03:21:31.519
or we just track him down, and

03:21:33.036 --> 03:21:34.539
I guess talk to him in person.

03:21:37.056 --> 03:21:40.719
MATT: "The choice is yours. Either way, I'll be watching."

03:21:43.516 --> 03:21:47.046
LAURA: Can I see any of his other compatriots around him?

03:21:47.046 --> 03:21:48.346
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:21:52.311 --> 03:21:54.011
LAURA: 15.
MATT: 15.

03:21:54.011 --> 03:21:54.996
Unfortunately, no.

03:21:54.996 --> 03:21:58.904
The focus of the scry

03:21:58.904 --> 03:22:00.795
is very localized to him

03:22:00.795 --> 03:22:03.796
and because of the proximity of the fire,

03:22:03.796 --> 03:22:05.996
you can see brightness to one side

03:22:05.996 --> 03:22:08.186
with the flicker of the flames

03:22:08.186 --> 03:22:10.216
and the rest beyond that is just shadow.

03:22:10.216 --> 03:22:11.049
LAURA: Okay.

03:22:14.066 --> 03:22:17.299
All right. I guess we can head back.

03:22:18.588 --> 03:22:21.866
MATT: Okay. Anybody else want to accomplish anything

03:22:21.866 --> 03:22:24.016
or do we go ahead and move on to--

03:22:24.016 --> 03:22:26.516
TALIESIN: I'd like to run Commune really quickly.

03:22:26.516 --> 03:22:27.349
MATT: All right.

03:22:29.086 --> 03:22:30.356
TALIESIN: Go out to the front of the ship.

03:22:30.356 --> 03:22:32.789
Set up a little space.

03:22:32.789 --> 03:22:33.755
TRAVIS: Tag!

03:22:33.755 --> 03:22:36.676
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:22:36.676 --> 03:22:37.886
My turn.

03:22:37.886 --> 03:22:38.719
MATT: All right.

03:22:39.676 --> 03:22:42.826
You see one of the other crew hands is just eyeing you oddly

03:22:42.826 --> 03:22:45.636
as you set up this small personal space,

03:22:45.636 --> 03:22:47.176
but doesn't engage, just like--

03:22:47.176 --> 03:22:48.879
TALIESIN: I turn my eyes completely white.

03:22:50.636 --> 03:22:52.915
MATT: Goes back to his work.
(laughter)

03:22:52.915 --> 03:22:55.082
TRAVIS: I think that'll do it.

03:23:01.926 --> 03:23:04.851
TALIESIN: Is Cree heading to the same destination we are?

03:23:06.556 --> 03:23:08.109
MATT: As you close your eyes,

03:23:09.646 --> 03:23:12.112
the cold breeze becomes

03:23:12.112 --> 03:23:16.212
not just like a gentle warmth,

03:23:16.212 --> 03:23:19.291
but like a hot coastal day.

03:23:20.376 --> 03:23:25.036
And any semblance of chill in the air

03:23:25.036 --> 03:23:28.951
is absent for a number of seconds.

03:23:32.716 --> 03:23:33.929
TALIESIN: Is he ahead of us?

03:23:36.366 --> 03:23:40.616
MATT: The warmth remains, but the breeze picks up,

03:23:40.616 --> 03:23:44.056
this time from behind you pushing forward,

03:23:44.056 --> 03:23:46.909
leading you to believe that, perhaps,

03:23:49.566 --> 03:23:51.934
the subject of this question is also ahead.

03:23:57.293 --> 03:24:01.476
TALIESIN: Does Vess know more about
the Tomb Takers than they let on?

03:24:04.506 --> 03:24:06.656
MATT: The breeze becomes chilled once more,

03:24:06.656 --> 03:24:10.522
MATT: The breeze becomes chilled once more,

03:24:11.606 --> 03:24:15.966
the space around you uncertain

03:24:15.966 --> 03:24:18.027
and non-committal.

03:24:20.105 --> 03:24:22.284
TALIESIN: That'll do. All right.

03:24:23.376 --> 03:24:25.326
Thank you.

03:24:25.326 --> 03:24:28.896
MATT: And as you finish your communion,

03:24:28.896 --> 03:24:32.816
you marvel as the snow that is gathered upon the deck,

03:24:32.816 --> 03:24:34.356
just that gentle snowfall

03:24:34.356 --> 03:24:38.066
that's begun to slightly drift down

03:24:38.066 --> 03:24:41.881
as the afternoon turns closer into evening

03:24:41.881 --> 03:24:43.666
for about a 10-foot radius around you,

03:24:43.666 --> 03:24:45.624
it is completely melted.

03:24:48.559 --> 03:24:51.686
TALIESIN: Yeah. Yeah, that's nice. All right.

03:24:51.686 --> 03:24:53.806
Put on my hat. Go back.

03:24:53.806 --> 03:24:54.639
MATT: All right.

03:24:55.786 --> 03:24:59.626
So for the first day's travel, who wants to roll a d10?

03:24:59.626 --> 03:25:00.459
SAM: Oh!

03:25:00.459 --> 03:25:01.292
TRAVIS: I do.

03:25:01.292 --> 03:25:02.696
SAM: You're the captain.

03:25:02.696 --> 03:25:05.029
TRAVIS: Well, not this time.

03:25:07.636 --> 03:25:09.186
Eight.

03:25:09.186 --> 03:25:11.968
MATT: Eight. Okay.

03:25:11.968 --> 03:25:13.518
SAM: What does that do?
LAURA: I don't know.

03:25:15.906 --> 03:25:19.029
MATT: Right as the sun begins to set,

03:25:21.446 --> 03:25:24.359
you hear a voice from the front of the deck of the ship go,

03:25:25.903 --> 03:25:26.736
"Captain."

03:25:27.606 --> 03:25:29.889
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: "Sighted below.

03:25:29.889 --> 03:25:31.080
"Wreckage below."

03:25:31.080 --> 03:25:32.216
SAM: Wreckage?

03:25:32.216 --> 03:25:33.366
MATT: Another bell begins to ring,

03:25:33.366 --> 03:25:35.166
just a singular one from the front.

03:25:35.166 --> 03:25:36.716
Some of the crew begins to shuffle forward

03:25:36.716 --> 03:25:39.199
and you guys all begin to hear this and scatter up.

03:25:40.386 --> 03:25:42.376
You can now see,

03:25:42.376 --> 03:25:45.806
whereas the open ocean that has met you this far

03:25:45.806 --> 03:25:49.726
into the journey has now become clustered patches

03:25:49.726 --> 03:25:52.846
of ice sheet, an ice shelf.

03:25:52.846 --> 03:25:54.196
Broken little islands

03:25:54.196 --> 03:25:58.362
and jagged clefts of frozen water

03:25:58.362 --> 03:26:00.246
that the ship is beginning to now push through

03:26:00.246 --> 03:26:01.256
and break through.

03:26:01.256 --> 03:26:03.116
And it's been doing this for about 30 or so minutes,

03:26:03.116 --> 03:26:04.966
and you can feel each impact

03:26:06.116 --> 03:26:09.036
grind through the ship with a faint vibration.

03:26:09.036 --> 03:26:11.316
But at this point, as you glance over, you can see

03:26:11.316 --> 03:26:13.406
as it's pushed through this one section

03:26:13.406 --> 03:26:15.626
of the frozen open water,

03:26:15.626 --> 03:26:18.009
there appears to be

03:26:18.009 --> 03:26:20.836
elements of wrecked ship

03:26:20.836 --> 03:26:25.276
that is pressed into one of these icy islands

03:26:25.276 --> 03:26:29.846
and floating bits of frost-covered, shattered wood

03:26:29.846 --> 03:26:31.096
in the waters around you.

03:26:32.316 --> 03:26:34.289
The captain glances over to the side and goes,

03:26:35.153 --> 03:26:39.433
"Right, right. Salvaging team, let's go ahead and gather.

03:26:39.433 --> 03:26:41.573
"See if there's any supplies or any survivors.

03:26:41.573 --> 03:26:43.573
"Don't know how long it's been,

03:26:43.573 --> 03:26:46.263
"as well as an investigation to
see how much time has passed,

03:26:46.263 --> 03:26:50.096
"since this had occurred. Any volunteers?"

03:26:50.096 --> 03:26:51.556
TRAVIS: Yes, I'll go.

03:26:51.556 --> 03:26:53.046
ASHLEY: I'll go.

03:26:53.046 --> 03:26:54.846
MATT: "Two volunteers for the mission. Anyone else?"

03:26:54.846 --> 03:26:55.679
LAURA: I'll go.

03:26:55.679 --> 03:26:57.806
SAM: Yeah, I mean, fuck yeah, let's do this.

03:26:57.806 --> 03:26:59.349
TALIESIN: I mean, if everybody else is going.
LAURA: You're going to go?

03:27:00.436 --> 03:27:03.371
SAM: Oh, <i>in</i> there? Oh, I'll just watch from the side.

03:27:03.371 --> 03:27:06.206
(laughter)

03:27:06.206 --> 03:27:07.243
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, let's--

03:27:07.243 --> 03:27:09.050
I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

03:27:09.050 --> 03:27:11.300
(laughter)

03:27:12.356 --> 03:27:13.206
MATT: All right.

03:27:13.206 --> 03:27:15.146
LIAM: What's DeRogna doing? She's hanging back?

03:27:15.146 --> 03:27:16.524
MATT: DeRogna's hanging back.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:27:17.946 --> 03:27:20.319
MATT: She's staying for the most part on her own. She's,

03:27:21.626 --> 03:27:24.826
in a not so unexpected way,

03:27:24.826 --> 03:27:26.296
her personal quarters looks like

03:27:26.296 --> 03:27:31.183
it was a storage region of this ship,

03:27:31.183 --> 03:27:32.456
but whenever she emerges,

03:27:32.456 --> 03:27:35.326
the interior of the storage chamber looks like

03:27:35.326 --> 03:27:38.296
a beautiful, much larger lush room.

03:27:38.296 --> 03:27:40.066
(laughter)

03:27:40.066 --> 03:27:40.909
Almost familiar.

03:27:42.522 --> 03:27:43.505
SAM: Are there cats all over it?

03:27:43.505 --> 03:27:45.463
LIAM: She's not worried about the boat going under.

03:27:45.463 --> 03:27:47.406
(laughter)

03:27:47.406 --> 03:27:49.336
MATT: At least not during the day.

03:27:49.336 --> 03:27:52.586
So you guys, what do you want to do to prepare to go

03:27:52.586 --> 03:27:53.896
and check into this salvage?

03:27:53.896 --> 03:27:56.264
LAURA: Are we going to jump into the water and, like--

03:27:56.264 --> 03:27:58.046
MATT: What are you going to do? It's up to you guys.

03:27:58.046 --> 03:28:00.406
LIAM: How far off is the wreckage
from the side of ice breaker?

03:28:00.406 --> 03:28:02.566
ASHLEY: Are we close enough to jump on from--

03:28:02.566 --> 03:28:05.656
TRAVIS: I guess we could ask Ruega Timbercall.

03:28:05.656 --> 03:28:07.166
Are we going to lower rope ladders?

03:28:07.166 --> 03:28:09.837
Are we making our way off the ship?

03:28:10.854 --> 03:28:12.666
MATT: "Planning to get a bit closer,

03:28:12.666 --> 03:28:13.931
"then we can drop some ladders,

03:28:13.931 --> 03:28:17.198
"but it's still mostly open icy sea, so--"

03:28:17.198 --> 03:28:20.046
TRAVIS: What's the thickness of the ice around these parts

03:28:20.046 --> 03:28:20.906
this time of year?

03:28:20.906 --> 03:28:22.036
MATT: She glances it over with their one,

03:28:22.036 --> 03:28:24.344
like squinky Popeye-like eye.

03:28:26.123 --> 03:28:28.456
"Hard to see in this sort of light.

03:28:28.456 --> 03:28:32.733
"Have assistance since it's close to nightfall itself.

03:28:32.733 --> 03:28:34.136
"But I'd say the sheets of ice can be anywhere

03:28:34.136 --> 03:28:35.957
"between 20, 30 feet deep."

03:28:35.957 --> 03:28:37.384
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: "If not more."

03:28:37.384 --> 03:28:39.176
TRAVIS: Better to send someone lighter to test it.

03:28:39.176 --> 03:28:42.336
Veth, are you open to go first and check the ice?

03:28:42.336 --> 03:28:44.219
SAM: The ice? I'll go to ice. Sure.

03:28:44.219 --> 03:28:46.351
TRAVIS: It's frozen water.

03:28:46.351 --> 03:28:48.559
SAM: Well, I mean, it's different.

03:28:48.559 --> 03:28:51.534
Like, steam is also water.
TRAVIS: I wanted to be clear,

03:28:51.534 --> 03:28:53.296
knowing that you have a thing with water.

03:28:53.296 --> 03:28:55.371
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm fine with steam.

03:28:55.371 --> 03:28:57.423
I'm fine with other forms of water,

03:28:57.423 --> 03:28:59.187
just not the liquid form.

03:29:00.776 --> 03:29:02.206
ASHLEY: Would you like me to hold your hand

03:29:02.206 --> 03:29:03.956
at the bottom of the ladder?

03:29:03.956 --> 03:29:07.273
So in case it breaks or--
SAM: Yes, sure.

03:29:07.273 --> 03:29:10.123
ASHLEY: You know, for safety?
SAM: Yes, please.

03:29:10.123 --> 03:29:11.148
ASHLEY: I'm sure you can hold on to the ladder,

03:29:11.148 --> 03:29:13.876
which is fine. Okay.
SAM: Please, hold my hand.

03:29:13.876 --> 03:29:16.041
Are you just going to lower me onto the ice? Is that--

03:29:16.041 --> 03:29:18.796
TRAVIS: We're all going to go.
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:29:18.796 --> 03:29:21.266
MATT: So we'll say for the purposes of this, you all decide,

03:29:21.266 --> 03:29:23.596
it's going to be a group investigation check,

03:29:23.596 --> 03:29:28.596
but you all decide what your particular focus is

03:29:28.836 --> 03:29:32.546
as part of this investigation/salvage venture towards

03:29:32.546 --> 03:29:34.386
the wreckage of the ship.

03:29:34.386 --> 03:29:35.743
LAURA: I'm going to--

03:29:37.016 --> 03:29:39.896
SAM: So it's frozen in the ice or it's under the ice?

03:29:39.896 --> 03:29:42.836
MATT: You can see elements of a ship
that looks like it crashed

03:29:42.836 --> 03:29:47.096
into and partially beached itself onto the ice.

03:29:47.096 --> 03:29:48.776
But then elements of it had broken away

03:29:48.776 --> 03:29:50.346
and sunken beneath the water.

03:29:50.346 --> 03:29:54.776
And you can see elements of shattered and floating wood

03:29:54.776 --> 03:29:56.093
that has since frosted over

03:29:56.093 --> 03:29:57.656
and adhered to the side of the ice.

03:29:57.656 --> 03:29:59.986
You only see maybe half of a ship here.

03:29:59.986 --> 03:30:02.276
The rest of it may have been pulled into the ocean below.

03:30:02.276 --> 03:30:04.406
TRAVIS: Once we get down there,
unless there are any objections,

03:30:04.406 --> 03:30:06.736
Caleb, Jester and Beau, if you'd like to investigate,

03:30:06.736 --> 03:30:09.476
I'd like Yasha to join me on security because we're on ice.

03:30:09.476 --> 03:30:11.806
I don't know what else lives out here or might be preying

03:30:11.806 --> 03:30:14.886
on things that cause vibrations on this ice shelf.

03:30:14.886 --> 03:30:19.441
And Caduceus, if you wouldn't mind keeping your keen ear?

03:30:19.441 --> 03:30:20.274
TALIESIN: Oh, of course.

03:30:20.274 --> 03:30:22.106
TRAVIS: We might be able to work most quickly that way.

03:30:22.106 --> 03:30:22.939
LAURA: Sure.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:30:22.939 --> 03:30:24.856
MARISHA: I can do that. Do you want to go under the ice

03:30:24.856 --> 03:30:27.596
or you want to stay in the half the ship that's above water?

03:30:27.596 --> 03:30:29.376
TRAVIS: Don't think we want to go under the ice ever.

03:30:29.376 --> 03:30:32.456
MARISHA: Yeah, feels real bad. Yeah. All right.

03:30:32.456 --> 03:30:34.756
TALIESIN: Does anybody want Water Walk? I can do that.

03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:37.726
LAURA: I think we're fine on the ice right now.

03:30:37.726 --> 03:30:39.176
TRAVIS: Famous last words, but sure.

03:30:40.246 --> 03:30:42.496
TALIESIN: That just means you
can't go under water if you want to.

03:30:42.496 --> 03:30:43.519
LAURA: Oh.

03:30:43.519 --> 03:30:44.927
TRAVIS: You know what? We're out on the ocean.

03:30:44.927 --> 03:30:47.539
Underwater Breathing. Everybody wins a prize!

03:30:47.539 --> 03:30:49.056
ALL: Hey!

03:30:49.056 --> 03:30:50.799
MATT: All right.
LAURA: I'm going to cast--

03:30:50.799 --> 03:30:51.826
TRAVIS: 4:20 every day.

03:30:51.826 --> 03:30:55.175
LAURA: -- Enhance Ability, Fox's Cunning

03:30:55.175 --> 03:30:58.006
on Beau

03:30:58.006 --> 03:31:01.468
to give her advantage on investigation.

03:31:01.468 --> 03:31:03.506
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: What? Advantage? What?

03:31:03.506 --> 03:31:05.686
LAURA: You get advantage on investigation checks.

03:31:05.686 --> 03:31:07.056
MATT: Intelligence checks in general.

03:31:07.056 --> 03:31:08.546
LAURA: Yes.

03:31:08.546 --> 03:31:09.620
MATT: All righty.

03:31:09.620 --> 03:31:13.186
So who all is actually going down to investigate?

03:31:13.186 --> 03:31:16.180
Fjord and Yasha

03:31:16.180 --> 03:31:19.886
and Caduceus, you're staying to keep watch?

03:31:19.886 --> 03:31:20.886
TALIESIN: We're going to be--

03:31:20.886 --> 03:31:22.436
LAURA: Security detail?
TRAVIS: Might come down there as well.

03:31:22.436 --> 03:31:23.726
MATT: Okay. Got you. All right. So--

03:31:23.726 --> 03:31:25.146
TRAVIS: You don't want to come?

03:31:25.146 --> 03:31:26.621
SAM: I'll come if we're not going in the water.

03:31:26.621 --> 03:31:27.896
Yeah, I'm in.

03:31:27.896 --> 03:31:29.026
MATT: Okay. So--

03:31:29.026 --> 03:31:31.126
MARISHA: Also me with the recent buff.

03:31:31.126 --> 03:31:31.997
MATT: Fair enough.

03:31:31.997 --> 03:31:35.156
So there is no rope ladder that leads below.

03:31:35.156 --> 03:31:37.346
It is a chain and iron ladder.

03:31:37.346 --> 03:31:39.116
There are just these two sets of chains

03:31:39.116 --> 03:31:40.516
with heavy metallic bits,

03:31:40.516 --> 03:31:42.626
but each of the rungs themselves are wrapped in leather

03:31:42.626 --> 03:31:44.916
so you don't have to like touch frozen metal

03:31:44.916 --> 03:31:46.216
as you make your way down.

03:31:47.566 --> 03:31:49.466
One by one, you climb down onto the ice shelf

03:31:49.466 --> 03:31:51.873
and it is slick and stopping by the edge where it is,

03:31:51.873 --> 03:31:53.626
it's crashing into the ship,

03:31:56.166 --> 03:31:58.786
it's pretty precarious to stay on the ice.

03:31:58.786 --> 03:32:02.146
Some of you do slip in a bit and fall into the water.

03:32:02.146 --> 03:32:04.709
I'd say anyone with a dex under 13

03:32:05.586 --> 03:32:07.206
who is making their way down

03:32:07.206 --> 03:32:09.264
ends up (splash) into the icy water,

03:32:09.264 --> 03:32:10.906
immediately chilling you,

03:32:10.906 --> 03:32:13.379
but the rest help you up and onto the ice.

03:32:14.476 --> 03:32:17.556
So whoever is engaging the investigation,

03:32:17.556 --> 03:32:19.605
go ahead and roll an investigation check for me, please.

03:32:19.605 --> 03:32:21.448
LAURA: Guidance.

03:32:21.448 --> 03:32:22.281
LIAM: Engaging?

03:32:22.281 --> 03:32:23.937
MARISHA: You said one, two, three? All right.

03:32:23.937 --> 03:32:25.162
LAURA: And you get advantage.
MARISHA: I get advantage.

03:32:25.162 --> 03:32:26.912
TRAVIS: You're perception, if that's cool.
TALIESIN: I'm perception.

03:32:29.039 --> 03:32:32.149
MATT: Hold off on perception. We'll get to that in a second.

03:32:34.755 --> 03:32:35.936
LAURA: (laughs)

03:32:35.936 --> 03:32:36.769
MARISHA: Okay.

03:32:39.316 --> 03:32:40.766
SAM: What'd you get there, Jessie?

03:32:41.800 --> 03:32:44.769
LAURA: Four! Did I find anything?

03:32:46.346 --> 03:32:47.179
MATT: No.

03:32:48.376 --> 03:32:50.226
SAM: 23.
MATT: 23.

03:32:50.226 --> 03:32:51.606
LIAM: 19.
MATT: 19.

03:32:51.606 --> 03:32:53.139
MARISHA: 27.
SAM: Hey!

03:32:54.126 --> 03:32:55.779
MATT: All right. So.

03:32:57.636 --> 03:33:00.906
because less people were involved, the DC was higher,

03:33:00.906 --> 03:33:02.836
but you all rolled pretty damn well,

03:33:02.836 --> 03:33:04.386
so that balanced it out.

03:33:04.386 --> 03:33:07.049
You discover amongst the wreckage there

03:33:08.856 --> 03:33:11.416
five frozen corpses.

03:33:11.416 --> 03:33:12.506
SAM: Ooh.

03:33:12.506 --> 03:33:14.496
MATT: Bodies that were frozen before they were able

03:33:14.496 --> 03:33:15.679
to bloat at sea.

03:33:17.028 --> 03:33:20.956
It looks like none of them died from any wounds.

03:33:20.956 --> 03:33:23.656
It looks like they all died from exposure

03:33:23.656 --> 03:33:26.386
and the temperature at sea.

03:33:26.386 --> 03:33:27.356
Some are floating in the water

03:33:27.356 --> 03:33:30.806
and their bodies are actually frozen against the wreckage.

03:33:30.806 --> 03:33:32.927
Very much like Jack on the door in--

03:33:32.927 --> 03:33:34.577
TRAVIS: I'll never let go, Rose.
MATT: Yep.

03:33:35.610 --> 03:33:37.366
TRAVIS: I can fit on the fucking square!

03:33:37.366 --> 03:33:39.391
MATT: And there's two of them that actually were on the ice

03:33:39.391 --> 03:33:41.956
and there it looks like they were trying to make a fire

03:33:41.956 --> 03:33:42.897
that they couldn't get to work

03:33:42.897 --> 03:33:45.996
and they just froze to death on the top there.

03:33:45.996 --> 03:33:50.276
Looking at their equipment on them,

03:33:50.276 --> 03:33:51.676
it's basic equipment,

03:33:51.676 --> 03:33:56.076
but two of them appear to wear symbology

03:33:56.076 --> 03:33:57.856
that leads you to believe that either are

03:33:57.856 --> 03:34:00.036
or were, at some point, Righteous Brand soldiers.

03:34:00.036 --> 03:34:01.689
So this looks to be an Empire

03:34:02.626 --> 03:34:04.286
excursion or at least members of the Empire

03:34:04.286 --> 03:34:06.253
who were on this ship.
MARISHA: Interesting.

03:34:07.656 --> 03:34:09.546
MATT: You also find numerous thick pelts

03:34:09.546 --> 03:34:11.976
that are frozen together, but, when thawed, could probably

03:34:11.976 --> 03:34:14.246
be serviceable and sellable

03:34:14.246 --> 03:34:16.966
for would be worth about 65 gold pieces altogether.

03:34:16.966 --> 03:34:18.328
So collection of pelts.

03:34:18.328 --> 03:34:19.161
TRAVIS: I'll take one of those.

03:34:20.426 --> 03:34:23.966
MATT: And perception checks, please, from both of you guys.

03:34:23.966 --> 03:34:24.799
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

03:34:27.017 --> 03:34:27.925
MATT: Yasha as well.

03:34:30.133 --> 03:34:31.992
SAM: Big rolls, Yasha.

03:34:31.992 --> 03:34:33.393
TALIESIN: 27.
ASHLEY: Ooh.

03:34:33.393 --> 03:34:34.416
MATT: 27.

03:34:34.416 --> 03:34:35.249
TRAVIS: 18.

03:34:36.676 --> 03:34:37.680
ASHLEY: 24.

03:34:37.680 --> 03:34:38.563
ALL: Ooh!

03:34:38.563 --> 03:34:40.229
MATT: Perception?
ASHLEY: My perception's pretty high,

03:34:40.229 --> 03:34:41.466
but I also rolled really high.

03:34:41.466 --> 03:34:43.106
MATT: Holy shit.
TRAVIS: All right.

03:34:43.106 --> 03:34:45.206
SAM: Best roll of the campaign.

03:34:45.206 --> 03:34:46.358
ASHLEY: Yeah, right?

03:34:46.358 --> 03:34:47.424
MATT: What you guys find,

03:34:47.424 --> 03:34:49.096
while they're going through the wreckage,

03:34:49.096 --> 03:34:52.351
floating a little ways off in the water,

03:34:52.351 --> 03:34:54.146
it looks like it's a small box,

03:34:54.146 --> 03:34:59.086
that's just like drifting in the water.

03:34:59.086 --> 03:35:00.548
MARISHA: Floating a little ways off.

03:35:00.548 --> 03:35:01.997
ASHLEY: You see that?

03:35:01.997 --> 03:35:02.830
TALIESIN: Huh.

03:35:04.526 --> 03:35:06.323
I'm going to use--

03:35:08.156 --> 03:35:10.846
MATT: It's about 25, 30 feet from the edge of the ice

03:35:10.846 --> 03:35:11.841
where you are.

03:35:11.841 --> 03:35:13.216
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Control Water--

03:35:13.216 --> 03:35:15.466
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: -- to bring right up towards us.

03:35:15.466 --> 03:35:18.226
MATT: You watch as from the somewhat shifting water

03:35:18.226 --> 03:35:20.256
from the presence of the ship,

03:35:20.256 --> 03:35:23.476
a bit of it seems to rise up like a pseudopod wave.

03:35:23.476 --> 03:35:27.236
It begins to roll and rush this box as it lifts it

03:35:27.236 --> 03:35:30.053
to the front and brings it right towards Caduceus

03:35:30.053 --> 03:35:31.642
and as it's about to crash upward,

03:35:31.642 --> 03:35:33.726
it dissipates, and the box

03:35:33.726 --> 03:35:36.073
gently lands right in your grasp.

03:35:36.073 --> 03:35:37.906
ASHLEY: Wow. That was cool.
TALIESIN: Detect magic.

03:35:38.866 --> 03:35:40.816
MATT: You sense a faint magic essence within the box.

03:35:40.816 --> 03:35:42.849
LAURA and ASHLEY: Ooh.
TALIESIN: It could be a trap.

03:35:43.854 --> 03:35:44.979
So we'll wait.

03:35:46.004 --> 03:35:48.320
ASHLEY: Okay,
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's fine.

03:35:48.320 --> 03:35:49.153
ASHLEY: Open it.

03:35:49.153 --> 03:35:51.901
LAURA: Why don't you just have Veth look at it?

03:35:52.813 --> 03:35:54.866
TALIESIN: Are you back already or?
SAM: I don't know.

03:35:54.866 --> 03:35:57.736
MATT: We'll say about 30 minutes or so of investigating

03:35:57.736 --> 03:35:58.856
this entire circumstance,

03:35:58.856 --> 03:36:01.476
you feel pretty confident that you found what you can find

03:36:01.476 --> 03:36:03.476
that is salvageable within the wreckage.

03:36:04.916 --> 03:36:07.876
You do all suffer a point of exhaustion

03:36:07.876 --> 03:36:12.011
from being out here for this long in the cold, unprotected--

03:36:12.011 --> 03:36:13.561
TRAVIS: Is it because we're also wet?
LAURA: What if I'm cold resistant?

03:36:13.561 --> 03:36:15.569
TRAVIS: Or just outside, in general?

03:36:15.569 --> 03:36:18.346
MATT: You would actually be the only one who does not suffer

03:36:18.346 --> 03:36:19.246
because you have cold resistance.

03:36:19.246 --> 03:36:20.959
You do not take a point of exhaustion.

03:36:24.466 --> 03:36:26.699
SAM: Do you need me to disarm this thing for you?

03:36:26.699 --> 03:36:29.716
TALIESIN: Yeah, just double check to make sure it's safe.

03:36:29.716 --> 03:36:32.916
SAM: All right. I will, with my Mage Hand--

03:36:32.916 --> 03:36:33.749
TALIESIN: Backing up.

03:36:33.749 --> 03:36:35.126
SAM: -- check it for traps.

03:36:35.126 --> 03:36:37.359
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll investigation.

03:36:38.456 --> 03:36:39.336
SAM: 23.

03:36:39.336 --> 03:36:41.786
MATT: 23. It is not trapped, but it is locked.

03:36:41.786 --> 03:36:44.779
SAM: I will try to unlock it.

03:36:46.896 --> 03:36:48.476
TRAVIS: 23.

03:36:48.476 --> 03:36:49.616
MATT: Thieves' tools plus dex.

03:36:49.616 --> 03:36:50.705
SAM: 35.

03:36:50.705 --> 03:36:52.037
ALL: (exclaiming)

03:36:52.037 --> 03:36:53.755
SAM: It was a natural 20.

03:36:53.755 --> 03:36:56.019
TALIESIN: Unlock my heart on that one.

03:36:56.019 --> 03:36:56.852
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

03:36:56.852 --> 03:36:59.796
MATT: You've seen some people do lock picks.

03:36:59.796 --> 03:37:02.106
It's a process of two hands at once with a tool

03:37:02.106 --> 03:37:03.696
jimmying it around and trying to find

03:37:03.696 --> 03:37:07.736
the right tumblers to click and shift in it. It's a process.

03:37:07.736 --> 03:37:09.796
You just watch the Mage's Hand go (click)

03:37:09.796 --> 03:37:11.449
like it's just a one movement.

03:37:13.241 --> 03:37:16.657
If a semi-transparent

03:37:16.657 --> 03:37:19.515
conjured arcane hand

03:37:19.515 --> 03:37:24.040
without personality could give a shrug, it did.

03:37:24.040 --> 03:37:26.601
But the box just opens up.

03:37:26.601 --> 03:37:27.606
LAURA: What is it?
MARISHA: Nice.

03:37:27.606 --> 03:37:28.576
LAURA: What's in it?

03:37:28.576 --> 03:37:30.276
MATT: Looking inside, you see a

03:37:30.276 --> 03:37:33.910
small wooden scroll case of some kind.

03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:35.660
LAURA: It's a scroll case.

03:37:37.326 --> 03:37:38.426
SAM: Magic man?

03:37:41.046 --> 03:37:43.616
LIAM: Is this trapped, the case itself?

03:37:43.616 --> 03:37:44.449
SAM: No.

03:37:44.449 --> 03:37:45.686
LIAM: Come on now.
SAM: All right. All right.

03:37:45.686 --> 03:37:47.027
I'll look at it.

03:37:48.116 --> 03:37:48.949
23.

03:37:48.949 --> 03:37:50.891
MATT: It is not trapped nor is it locked.

03:37:50.891 --> 03:37:52.974
LAURA: Open it up. Open it up.

03:37:54.427 --> 03:37:56.526
MATT: It's a fairly thick piece of parchment.

03:37:56.526 --> 03:37:58.179
It's a singular scroll.

03:37:59.266 --> 03:38:02.486
It has a very strong--

03:38:02.486 --> 03:38:03.756
some of the runes give you a sense

03:38:03.756 --> 03:38:05.496
of an abjuration-based enchantment,

03:38:05.496 --> 03:38:07.087
but you have to either spend some time with it

03:38:07.087 --> 03:38:09.349
or an Identify spell to figure
out specifically what it does.

03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:12.014
MARISHA: Is that high quality paper
or just basic bitch paper?

03:38:12.014 --> 03:38:13.686
LIAM: It is a miracle that it is dry.

03:38:13.686 --> 03:38:17.426
That it has survived floating at sea like this.

03:38:17.426 --> 03:38:18.799
Yeah, high quality.

03:38:21.248 --> 03:38:22.346
Well, let's get back on the ship.

03:38:22.346 --> 03:38:23.276
MATT: Okay.

03:38:23.276 --> 03:38:26.453
As you guys get back up onto the ship, the crew goes,

03:38:26.453 --> 03:38:27.903
"Hey, welcome back. Welcome back.

03:38:27.903 --> 03:38:29.136
"So did you find anything?"

03:38:29.136 --> 03:38:30.255
The captain's like,

03:38:30.255 --> 03:38:31.973
"What'd you manage to salvage?"

03:38:32.906 --> 03:38:36.756
LAURA: "This collection of frozen pelts!"

03:38:37.789 --> 03:38:39.363
MATT: "All right, that's money. Put it in the butt."

03:38:39.363 --> 03:38:43.136
And some of the people take it and take it down below deck.

03:38:43.136 --> 03:38:44.566
LAURA: Except Fjord took one of them.

03:38:44.566 --> 03:38:47.146
MATT: Right, so you have one pelt that's worth 15 gold.

03:38:47.146 --> 03:38:49.156
TRAVIS: I'm going to fix that over my shoulder.

03:38:49.156 --> 03:38:51.646
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: Make it a thing.

03:38:51.646 --> 03:38:53.636
TALIESIN: Did we bring back any of the dead people

03:38:53.636 --> 03:38:55.946
or did we not bring back any of them?

03:38:55.946 --> 03:38:59.304
SAM: Oh, we didn't.
LAURA: We've found these five dead people!

03:38:59.304 --> 03:39:01.958
(laughter)

03:39:03.106 --> 03:39:04.176
MATT: They look at them.

03:39:04.176 --> 03:39:06.076
TALIESIN: We could talk to them later,

03:39:06.076 --> 03:39:07.016
find out what happened,

03:39:07.016 --> 03:39:08.796
just in case it's something.

03:39:08.796 --> 03:39:10.976
MATT: They all look at each other.

03:39:10.976 --> 03:39:13.307
You watch as Ruega goes like,

03:39:14.174 --> 03:39:16.474
"I can probably gather what happened to them."

03:39:17.916 --> 03:39:19.766
And she goes and kicks one overboard.

03:39:20.641 --> 03:39:23.224
(laughter)

03:39:24.486 --> 03:39:25.319
TALIESIN: Decompose.

03:39:26.546 --> 03:39:30.176
MATT: One by one, the bodies are put back (splashing)

03:39:30.176 --> 03:39:31.056
into the water.

03:39:31.056 --> 03:39:32.456
The ship picks up once more.

03:39:33.866 --> 03:39:38.456
The ice channel does slow the progression and add a day to

03:39:38.456 --> 03:39:39.916
the journey.

03:39:39.916 --> 03:39:41.796
These rolls and the different events that can happen

03:39:41.796 --> 03:39:44.736
can add days, take days away and other events can happen.

03:39:44.736 --> 03:39:45.976
TRAVIS: And the point of exhaustion wasn't just

03:39:45.976 --> 03:39:48.146
because we got wet, when we fell down the ladder,

03:39:48.146 --> 03:39:49.886
it's just being outside in this--

03:39:49.886 --> 03:39:53.468
MATT: Just being out there, exerting yourself in

03:39:53.468 --> 03:39:57.183
this proximity of freezing water, freezing air,

03:39:57.183 --> 03:39:58.016
that kind of a deal.

03:39:58.016 --> 03:39:59.676
TRAVIS: How long were we out there about

03:39:59.676 --> 03:40:02.119
before the point of exhaustion hit, ish?

03:40:03.086 --> 03:40:04.876
MATT: I'd say--
TRAVIS: Few hours?

03:40:04.876 --> 03:40:06.946
MATT: No, but close to an hour.

03:40:06.946 --> 03:40:08.386
MARISHA: Oh, fuck you guys.
TALIESIN: Weird.

03:40:08.386 --> 03:40:09.344
Other weird question.

03:40:09.344 --> 03:40:11.196
Is this the sort of thing Protection

03:40:11.196 --> 03:40:12.976
from Energy would help with?

03:40:12.976 --> 03:40:14.706
MATT: If it's-- if you choose cold, yes.

03:40:14.706 --> 03:40:16.106
TALIESIN: Cool.

03:40:16.106 --> 03:40:17.126
Good to know.

03:40:17.126 --> 03:40:18.726
TRAVIS: Protection from Energy?

03:40:18.726 --> 03:40:21.156
TALIESIN: I can-- I have a spell that I can cast

03:40:21.156 --> 03:40:22.546
that will just make me--

03:40:22.546 --> 03:40:26.936
give me resistance to one type of damage for an hour.

03:40:26.936 --> 03:40:28.506
TRAVIS: Cool.

03:40:28.506 --> 03:40:29.896
TALIESIN: Or anybody else for that matter.

03:40:29.896 --> 03:40:32.879
MATT: So if it makes you feel better,

03:40:32.879 --> 03:40:34.471
it's less like a ticking,

03:40:34.471 --> 03:40:37.356
you take exhaustion every hour. It's not <i>that</i> cold.

03:40:37.356 --> 03:40:41.056
It's just, exertion in an inhospitable environment like this

03:40:41.056 --> 03:40:43.331
It's just, exertion in an inhospitable environment like this

03:40:43.331 --> 03:40:45.506
would give you a point of exhaustion for the day

03:40:45.506 --> 03:40:49.168
or for this specific endeavor of activity

03:40:49.168 --> 03:40:50.696
in an unprotected space.

03:40:50.696 --> 03:40:51.529
TRAVIS: Good clarification.

03:40:51.529 --> 03:40:53.556
LIAM: If you drink hot mulled wine on the deck of the ship

03:40:53.556 --> 03:40:55.172
and just sort of huddle together and relax,

03:40:55.172 --> 03:40:56.016
you'll be fine.
MATT: Then you're fine.

03:40:56.016 --> 03:40:56.849
LIAM: But if we go--

03:40:56.849 --> 03:40:57.682
MATT: Like, if you're on the ship--

03:40:57.682 --> 03:40:59.816
but spending a period of time off the ship,

03:40:59.816 --> 03:41:01.686
would be considered traversing.

03:41:01.686 --> 03:41:03.096
TRAVIS: On a glacier out in Antarctica.

03:41:03.096 --> 03:41:06.386
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. An unhappy terrain.

03:41:06.386 --> 03:41:08.286
And for extended periods of time,

03:41:08.286 --> 03:41:10.456
that would bleed into, you know,

03:41:10.456 --> 03:41:12.826
constitution checks and all sorts of things,

03:41:12.826 --> 03:41:14.216
depending on the environment you're in.

03:41:14.216 --> 03:41:16.666
But for the purposes of this, it was just one endeavor,

03:41:16.666 --> 03:41:17.826
one specific task.

03:41:17.826 --> 03:41:21.406
And you managed to only suffer one point of exhaustion

03:41:21.406 --> 03:41:22.410
because of it.

03:41:22.410 --> 03:41:23.718
LAURA: (shivering sound)

03:41:23.718 --> 03:41:26.559
MATT: So anyway, you're back on the ship.

03:41:26.559 --> 03:41:28.916
You've traveled the day,

03:41:28.916 --> 03:41:31.646
but you've also gained a day of travel.

03:41:31.646 --> 03:41:33.166
We move on to the second day.

03:41:33.166 --> 03:41:35.266
So if you'd like to roll again.

03:41:35.266 --> 03:41:36.949
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.
SAM: d10, d10.

03:41:36.949 --> 03:41:39.306
TRAVIS: Anybody else want to roll or is it just me?

03:41:39.306 --> 03:41:40.268
TALIESIN: Captain.
ASHLEY: Captain.

03:41:40.268 --> 03:41:41.101
SAM: Cap.

03:41:42.316 --> 03:41:43.946
TRAVIS: Nine.

03:41:43.946 --> 03:41:45.564
MATT: All right.
SAM: Suspicious.

03:41:47.356 --> 03:41:48.766
MATT: The next morning comes to you

03:41:48.766 --> 03:41:53.146
and you find heavy sea smoke, or what's called ice fog,

03:41:53.146 --> 03:41:55.513
begins to coat over the ocean ahead of you,

03:41:55.513 --> 03:41:58.446
making visibility very challenging for the day.

03:41:58.446 --> 03:42:01.812
You can hear the captain cursing and occasionally the ship,

03:42:01.812 --> 03:42:05.786
(scraping) hits and grinds against
some piece of heavy ice flow

03:42:05.786 --> 03:42:08.086
that was unseen before impacting

03:42:08.086 --> 03:42:09.676
with the front of the icebreaker.

03:42:09.676 --> 03:42:10.656
Thankfully, it's an ice breaker

03:42:10.656 --> 03:42:13.596
so it seems to be able to handle these things.

03:42:13.596 --> 03:42:16.151
Other ships might have not fared as well,

03:42:18.216 --> 03:42:21.852
but the heavy clouds and such does add a day to the journey.

03:42:22.918 --> 03:42:24.776
SAM: Jeez, we're not making a lot of progress.

03:42:24.776 --> 03:42:26.316
MATT: You're not.

03:42:26.316 --> 03:42:27.856
It's slow going at this point,

03:42:27.856 --> 03:42:30.306
but it's also some really unlucky rolls.

03:42:30.306 --> 03:42:32.416
TRAVIS: Are we seeing--
MARISHA: Unlucky rolls?

03:42:32.416 --> 03:42:34.068
TRAVIS: During the crawling through the ice,

03:42:34.068 --> 03:42:35.966
are we seeing anything out on the ice shelves?

03:42:35.966 --> 03:42:40.906
Any sort of animals or activity? Life, anything?

03:42:40.906 --> 03:42:42.473
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:42:45.056 --> 03:42:45.956
TRAVIS: Seven.

03:42:45.956 --> 03:42:48.306
MATT: Seven. Unfortunately, this particular day

03:42:48.306 --> 03:42:49.676
with this heavy ice fog,

03:42:49.676 --> 03:42:52.446
you're not able to see anything out there.

03:42:52.446 --> 03:42:55.056
Most of the sheets of ice that you can see,

03:42:55.056 --> 03:42:56.706
you notice after they've impacted

03:42:56.706 --> 03:42:58.736
or they're right below the ship.

03:42:58.736 --> 03:43:00.466
You can just barely see the surface of the water

03:43:00.466 --> 03:43:02.016
for about 10 feet out from the base of the boat

03:43:02.016 --> 03:43:04.174
and beyond that, it's just white fog.

03:43:05.536 --> 03:43:08.983
TRAVIS: Just out of curiosity, because we're crawling,

03:43:08.983 --> 03:43:13.032
at fifth level, I'll cast Create or Destroy Water.

03:43:13.032 --> 03:43:14.374
MATT: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: And that allows me

03:43:14.374 --> 03:43:18.923
to make a 50-foot cube of rain,

03:43:18.923 --> 03:43:22.498
which cancels out fog.

03:43:22.498 --> 03:43:23.548
MATT: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Freezing rain.

03:43:23.548 --> 03:43:26.036
So it should clear like a 50-foot cube out to one side.

03:43:26.036 --> 03:43:27.156
MATT: For how long?

03:43:27.156 --> 03:43:28.756
TRAVIS: It's instantaneous, so not very long.

03:43:28.756 --> 03:43:30.422
Just to see what's out there.
MATT: To see what's out there.

03:43:30.422 --> 03:43:31.255
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

03:43:31.255 --> 03:43:32.676
TRAVIS: Because I hate Stephen King novels.

03:43:32.676 --> 03:43:34.382
MATT: Fair enough.

03:43:34.382 --> 03:43:36.666
As you concentrate

03:43:36.666 --> 03:43:40.336
and put your hand out in front of you, you watch as this

03:43:42.056 --> 03:43:43.936
pattering sound begins to hit the water ahead,

03:43:43.936 --> 03:43:46.016
as this freezing rain aims to cut through this fog.

03:43:46.016 --> 03:43:48.486
And as you see, the water below begins to open up

03:43:48.486 --> 03:43:50.886
in this 50-foot area in front of the ship.

03:43:50.886 --> 03:43:55.886
And it is just numerous, small pieces of broken ice flow.

03:43:55.916 --> 03:43:59.737
And you do see, for a split second,

03:43:59.737 --> 03:44:02.636
two darker colored seals

03:44:02.636 --> 03:44:06.341
that dart beneath the icy water out of your visual range

03:44:06.341 --> 03:44:07.646
as soon as your ship begins to approach

03:44:07.646 --> 03:44:09.776
where they were resting. So there is life out here.

03:44:09.776 --> 03:44:11.404
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: Dire seals.

03:44:11.404 --> 03:44:13.677
(laughter)

03:44:13.677 --> 03:44:15.332
LIAM: (seal barking)

03:44:15.332 --> 03:44:17.004
TRAVIS: They're going (barks) (hissing).

03:44:17.004 --> 03:44:18.798
(laughter)

03:44:18.798 --> 03:44:20.089
LAURA: I'm going to, um--

03:44:20.089 --> 03:44:22.636
MATT: Elephant seals look nasty.
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck. Get back!

03:44:24.076 --> 03:44:25.067
MARISHA: Put it back.

03:44:25.067 --> 03:44:25.900
MATT: What's up, Jester?

03:44:25.900 --> 03:44:28.868
LAURA: I'm going to take out the Rod of Hand Warming.

03:44:28.868 --> 03:44:31.656
And then I'm going to get my pastries that I bought.

03:44:31.656 --> 03:44:34.726
I'm going to put them on the rod and warm them up

03:44:34.726 --> 03:44:36.507
and pass out some pastries.

03:44:36.507 --> 03:44:37.759
(laughter)

03:44:37.759 --> 03:44:40.309
MATT: That is a proper use of magical items. Yes.

03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:41.356
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: Yes.

03:44:41.356 --> 03:44:42.686
TRAVIS: It's just a stick of uranium.

03:44:42.686 --> 03:44:44.198
(laughter)

03:44:44.198 --> 03:44:45.031
TRAVIS: We are all going to die.

03:44:45.031 --> 03:44:47.233
MATT: This tastes great. Why are my teeth falling out?

03:44:48.076 --> 03:44:49.606
TALIESIN: Take a point of exhaustion every year.

03:44:49.606 --> 03:44:50.439
MATT: Yep.

03:44:50.439 --> 03:44:52.866
(laughter)

03:44:52.866 --> 03:44:53.699
MATT: All righty.

03:44:53.699 --> 03:44:54.665
LIAM: If we're jumping day by day,

03:44:54.665 --> 03:44:57.414
I would have checked out what that scroll was.

03:44:57.414 --> 03:44:59.216
MATT: All right. So with that--

03:44:59.216 --> 03:45:02.476
and you can go and add this to your collection there.

03:45:02.476 --> 03:45:04.416
It is a scroll of protection,

03:45:04.416 --> 03:45:07.144
specifically for aberrations.

03:45:07.144 --> 03:45:08.438
LIAM: Okay.

03:45:08.438 --> 03:45:11.006
MATT: You can look up in D&amp;D Beyond
specifically what that does.

03:45:11.006 --> 03:45:13.366
Just put scroll of protection, aberrations.

03:45:13.366 --> 03:45:14.199
LIAM: Okay.

03:45:15.836 --> 03:45:17.877
And I will use

03:45:19.544 --> 03:45:21.377
six hours on the previous day,

03:45:21.377 --> 03:45:24.116
and if this day is about to go up, another six hours

03:45:24.116 --> 03:45:27.029
to do studying, to absorb another spell.

03:45:28.126 --> 03:45:29.516
MATT: You got it. All right.
LIAM: Okay.

03:45:29.516 --> 03:45:30.776
LAURA: I'll sit down next to Caleb

03:45:30.776 --> 03:45:32.546
while he's poring over his books

03:45:32.546 --> 03:45:36.846
and I'm going to sketch for, like, 30 minutes,

03:45:36.846 --> 03:45:38.124
before I get bored.

03:45:38.124 --> 03:45:39.678
LIAM: What are you drawing?

03:45:39.678 --> 03:45:43.913
LAURA: I'm drawing a hot cup of cocoa.

03:45:43.913 --> 03:45:45.226
LIAM: Are there dicks in it?

03:45:45.226 --> 03:45:48.776
LAURA: No, there's two very lovely marshmallows.

03:45:48.776 --> 03:45:49.986
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:45:49.986 --> 03:45:53.743
LAURA: That are just cozying up,
shnuggling up next to each other.

03:45:53.743 --> 03:45:54.576
LIAM: Yeah.

03:45:54.576 --> 03:45:56.459
SAM: With consent.
LAURA: With consent.

03:45:59.278 --> 03:46:01.716
LIAM: But we're not talking about grass, are we?

03:46:01.716 --> 03:46:03.176
LAURA: No, I'm talking about marshmallows.

03:46:03.176 --> 03:46:04.166
LIAM: Marshmallows.

03:46:04.166 --> 03:46:05.876
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

03:46:05.876 --> 03:46:08.008
Felt like that was a hidden meaning for a moment.

03:46:08.008 --> 03:46:09.506
LAURA: No.
LIAM: Okay.

03:46:09.506 --> 03:46:11.296
LAURA: Just marshmallows.
LIAM: Okay.

03:46:11.296 --> 03:46:14.956
LAURA: Marshmallows with wings. Marshmallows with staffs.

03:46:14.956 --> 03:46:16.922
Marshmallows.

03:46:16.922 --> 03:46:18.272
MARISHA: There it is.

03:46:19.416 --> 03:46:20.636
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:46:20.636 --> 03:46:21.949
LIAM: I see.
MATT: All right.

03:46:23.146 --> 03:46:25.765
Third day at sea. Go ahead and roll a d10 for me.

03:46:25.765 --> 03:46:27.057
SAM: Come on, Fjord.

03:46:27.057 --> 03:46:30.186
ASHLEY: Marshmallows.
MARISHA: With wings and staffs.

03:46:30.186 --> 03:46:32.806
TRAVIS: Six.
MATT: Six.

03:46:32.806 --> 03:46:33.966
All righty.

03:46:33.966 --> 03:46:35.483
A fair day's travel.

03:46:35.483 --> 03:46:38.926
LAURA: Yay! We did it!

03:46:38.926 --> 03:46:42.286
MATT: So no major issues on this length of the journey.

03:46:42.286 --> 03:46:44.142
LIAM: Guys, we won the campaign.

03:46:44.142 --> 03:46:45.166
MATT: You did. Success.

03:46:45.166 --> 03:46:46.549
LAURA: We won D&amp;D!

03:46:48.026 --> 03:46:49.389
MATT: Clear skies ahead.

03:46:49.389 --> 03:46:51.436
The temperature almost seems slightly warmer this day.

03:46:51.436 --> 03:46:54.066
It's a comfortable day of passage and you can see just even

03:46:54.066 --> 03:46:57.076
the general atmosphere on the ship itself.

03:46:57.076 --> 03:46:59.024
The crew seems to be a little more jovial

03:46:59.024 --> 03:47:01.680
and a little more relaxed than the previous two days.

03:47:01.680 --> 03:47:03.126
TALIESIN: Arr.

03:47:03.126 --> 03:47:05.246
MATT: Fourth day journey.

03:47:05.246 --> 03:47:06.079
You want to roll again?

03:47:06.079 --> 03:47:06.912
TRAVIS: Sure.
MATT: All right.

03:47:09.446 --> 03:47:10.279
TRAVIS: Eight.

03:47:11.276 --> 03:47:12.109
MATT: Eight.
TALIESIN: Man.

03:47:13.236 --> 03:47:15.916
MATT: Another ice channel. There is no wreckage this time,

03:47:15.916 --> 03:47:19.206
but it does add a day to the journey.

03:47:19.206 --> 03:47:21.001
MARISHA: So how many days are we at now?

03:47:21.001 --> 03:47:24.856
SAM: This is our fourth day of travel,
but we've only moved one day.

03:47:24.856 --> 03:47:27.196
MARISHA: Oh no. Is that true?

03:47:27.196 --> 03:47:28.387
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Oh.

03:47:29.516 --> 03:47:30.666
MATT: You have about six more days of travel.

03:47:30.666 --> 03:47:33.308
TRAVIS: We're going to eat these people.

03:47:33.308 --> 03:47:34.716
MARISHA: Oh shit!

03:47:34.716 --> 03:47:37.225
MATT: It's a rough go.
MARISHA: Donner party of nine.

03:47:37.225 --> 03:47:38.466
LAURA: I'm going to roll the next one.

03:47:38.466 --> 03:47:39.572
TALIESIN: Going to turn them into bacon.

03:47:39.572 --> 03:47:42.139
SAM: I think that we've just passed that shipwreck

03:47:42.139 --> 03:47:43.631
that we investigated.

03:47:46.176 --> 03:47:47.126
MATT: Who's going to roll?

03:47:48.246 --> 03:47:50.386
LAURA: Fjord is going to roll.
TALIESIN: Then we'll start going around.

03:47:51.506 --> 03:47:53.726
TRAVIS: One.
SAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Yay.

03:47:53.726 --> 03:47:54.796
TRAVIS: That's probably not good either.

03:47:54.796 --> 03:47:55.656
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: And we sink.

03:47:55.656 --> 03:47:56.806
MARISHA: Is it the extremes?

03:47:56.806 --> 03:47:58.536
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Cool.

03:47:58.536 --> 03:48:00.428
MATT: So.
TRAVIS: Fuck will fuck up.

03:48:00.428 --> 03:48:01.779
ASHLEY: All right.

03:48:01.779 --> 03:48:04.086
MATT: That morning--
ASHLEY: Okay. We're going to die.

03:48:04.086 --> 03:48:07.716
MATT: The heavy clouds grow darker

03:48:08.566 --> 03:48:11.216
and the winds that were once still, begin to pick up.

03:48:14.476 --> 03:48:19.364
You feel the snowfall begin to turn into sleet,

03:48:19.364 --> 03:48:21.186
You feel the snowfall begin to turn into sleet,

03:48:21.186 --> 03:48:22.019
then hail

03:48:23.296 --> 03:48:27.786
and a heavy arctic storm begins to encompass

03:48:27.786 --> 03:48:29.309
the space around the ship.

03:48:30.686 --> 03:48:31.779
It slows travel.

03:48:33.434 --> 03:48:34.557
SAM: To negative one.

03:48:38.026 --> 03:48:40.416
MATT: If I could have Caduceus and Beauregard

03:48:40.416 --> 03:48:43.032
both roll perception checks with disadvantage.

03:48:43.032 --> 03:48:46.291
LAURA: Oh no.
MARISHA: No. Wait, what? No.

03:48:51.074 --> 03:48:54.797
TALIESIN: 15.
MARISHA: Oh, yikesy. Six.

03:48:55.776 --> 03:48:57.726
MATT: The crew is currently in the process of shouting

03:48:57.726 --> 03:49:00.117
at each other. They're starting to

03:49:00.117 --> 03:49:02.096
prepare themselves for the onslaught.

03:49:02.096 --> 03:49:03.939
They're beginning to head below deck.

03:49:03.939 --> 03:49:06.946
A lot of them are throwing protective sheets

03:49:06.946 --> 03:49:07.779
over the ballista.

03:49:07.779 --> 03:49:10.836
But you watch as the sleet is currently causing ice

03:49:10.836 --> 03:49:14.538
to build up around the weaponry on the deck.

03:49:14.538 --> 03:49:16.413
MARISHA: Caduceus, what is happening?

03:49:16.413 --> 03:49:20.007
MATT: You hear a strange clicking sound.

03:49:20.007 --> 03:49:21.066
MARISHA: Caduceus?

03:49:21.066 --> 03:49:23.916
TALIESIN: There's a-- I hear a sound. There's something,

03:49:23.916 --> 03:49:26.086
Is it coming from outside the ship?

03:49:26.086 --> 03:49:29.026
MATT: It's coming from somewhere beyond the deck.

03:49:29.026 --> 03:49:31.816
And there is now, between the sleet storm and the fog

03:49:31.816 --> 03:49:33.616
that's around and the heavy sound of

03:49:33.616 --> 03:49:38.099
the hitting of the deck of all these hundreds and thousands

03:49:38.099 --> 03:49:40.265
of pelts of ice. You hear this, like,

03:49:40.265 --> 03:49:42.773
(clicking).

03:49:42.773 --> 03:49:44.409
MARISHA: Fucking clickers.

03:49:44.409 --> 03:49:46.356
TALIESIN: I am-- Okay, really quick, out of curiosity--

03:49:46.356 --> 03:49:47.756
It's been seven days since the last time

03:49:47.756 --> 03:49:50.173
I tried Divine Intervention, hasn't it?

03:49:51.016 --> 03:49:54.556
MATT: Last time was on the island, right?

03:49:54.556 --> 03:49:55.508
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

03:49:55.508 --> 03:49:57.209
It's been more than seven days.

03:49:57.209 --> 03:49:59.056
TALIESIN: Let's see if we can get rid of the storm?

03:50:01.841 --> 03:50:03.025
No.

03:50:03.025 --> 03:50:05.406
(laughter)

03:50:05.406 --> 03:50:07.646
MATT: Unfortunately, in the center of this chaos,

03:50:07.646 --> 03:50:09.669
the Wild Mother can not hear your prayer.

03:50:11.476 --> 03:50:13.707
TALIESIN: Are there any crew members running around?

03:50:13.707 --> 03:50:15.506
MATT: There are what looks like four of them right now

03:50:15.506 --> 03:50:17.926
that are on the deck trying to clear off the--

03:50:17.926 --> 03:50:20.806
TALIESIN: What kind of thing
makes a clicking sound out there?

03:50:20.806 --> 03:50:22.866
MATT: "What do you mean clicking sound?"

03:50:22.866 --> 03:50:24.436
TALIESIN: (clicking)

03:50:24.436 --> 03:50:25.816
MATT: "No idea what you're talking about."

03:50:25.816 --> 03:50:28.016
TALIESIN: There's something out there.

03:50:28.016 --> 03:50:30.643
MARISHA: I pull out my bo

03:50:30.643 --> 03:50:33.624
and I just say: Mighty Nein!

03:50:33.624 --> 03:50:34.457
SAM: Ah!

03:50:34.457 --> 03:50:36.150
MARISHA: And shout for everybody.

03:50:36.150 --> 03:50:37.436
MATT: You guys here Beau shouting

03:50:37.436 --> 03:50:38.852
from the top of the deck.

03:50:38.852 --> 03:50:40.626
TRAVIS: (whoosh) Sword.
LAURA: Go running up.

03:50:40.626 --> 03:50:41.830
MATT: Sword is out, okay.

03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:44.636
LAURA: Invoke Duplicity and run up.

03:50:44.636 --> 03:50:46.976
MATT: Okay. You guys head up as the crew,

03:50:46.976 --> 03:50:49.636
in the process of getting these heavy tarps

03:50:49.636 --> 03:50:51.919
over the ballista, locking them down.

03:50:52.766 --> 03:50:55.446
One of the crew hands who was talking to you, Caduceus,

03:50:55.446 --> 03:50:59.316
runs over to the edge and looks over.

03:50:59.316 --> 03:51:00.149
"What the--!"

03:51:00.149 --> 03:51:02.266
and you see something grab

03:51:02.266 --> 03:51:05.056
and yank him over to the side. His legs just go,

03:51:05.056 --> 03:51:06.586
vanishing out of sight.
MARISHA: That's not good.

03:51:06.586 --> 03:51:08.246
LIAM: I'm casting Mirror Image on myself.

03:51:08.246 --> 03:51:10.306
TALIESIN: Casting Water Walk on everybody.

03:51:10.306 --> 03:51:11.139
MATT: Okay.

03:51:12.356 --> 03:51:15.686
You can feel grinding against the base of the ship.

03:51:15.686 --> 03:51:18.006
Bits of ice and such are slamming into the sides of it

03:51:18.006 --> 03:51:19.586
in the middle of the storm.

03:51:19.586 --> 03:51:21.686
And you watch as, rising up over the edge,

03:51:23.146 --> 03:51:26.156
these massive crustacean-like creatures,

03:51:26.156 --> 03:51:28.846
with a dull, grayish,

03:51:28.846 --> 03:51:32.246
almost tan coloration to them with these heavy jagged claws

03:51:32.246 --> 03:51:34.096
and multiple legs.

03:51:34.096 --> 03:51:37.786
You recall seeing something like this

03:51:37.786 --> 03:51:39.406
beneath the ocean once before.

03:51:39.406 --> 03:51:42.106
LAURA: Oh shit!
MATT: Tangled in the mass of--

03:51:42.106 --> 03:51:43.362
LIAM: In that Leaning Tower of Pisa.

03:51:43.362 --> 03:51:44.995
SAM: Oh, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:51:44.995 --> 03:51:46.645
MARISHA: Wait, when we were in Dashilla shit?
MATT: And you see one,

03:51:46.645 --> 03:51:49.072
two and a third one is now climbing up

03:51:49.072 --> 03:51:51.213
over the edge there.
LAURA: Oh no no no.

03:51:52.611 --> 03:51:53.444
SAM: Three?

03:51:54.865 --> 03:51:56.715
MATT: So let me go ahead and set up a map.

03:51:56.715 --> 03:52:01.715
(cheering)

03:52:01.869 --> 03:52:03.746
TRAVIS: My body is ready.

03:52:03.746 --> 03:52:04.579
SAM: Guys--
LAURA: So ready.

03:52:04.579 --> 03:52:07.616
SAM: This combat is sponsored by Dwarven Forge.

LIAM: He's corded. He's corded.

03:52:23.849 --> 03:52:25.541
MATT: The cord can come with me, actually.

03:52:27.482 --> 03:52:29.806

03:53:17.307 --> 03:53:18.315
There.

03:53:18.315 --> 03:53:20.376
LAURA: So we could jump out and land on the ice.

03:53:20.376 --> 03:53:22.886
SAM: Yeah, we could do some sort of weird hopscotch thing.

03:53:22.886 --> 03:53:24.327

03:53:27.426 --> 03:53:29.956
Just so you know, the creatures that you saw emerge

03:53:29.956 --> 03:53:32.151
came up over this edge here.

03:53:32.151 --> 03:53:34.286
MARISHA: Ah!

03:53:34.286 --> 03:53:36.869
MATT: Here. This is actually placed there.

03:53:38.106 --> 03:53:42.506
And this one is currently rising up, back over the edge,

03:53:42.506 --> 03:53:43.339
right there.

03:53:43.339 --> 03:53:46.356
LAURA: And if we came up from below deck, we would be--?

03:53:46.356 --> 03:53:47.706
MATT: Over in this space here.
LAURA: Okay.

03:53:47.706 --> 03:53:51.579
MATT: So Beauregard and Caduceus, you are up top,

03:53:51.579 --> 03:53:53.689
and closer to this edge here.

03:53:55.155 --> 03:53:57.213
Beauregard probably here shouting out to the group.

03:53:58.625 --> 03:53:59.636
Unless there's anywhere else you'd wish to be?

03:53:59.636 --> 03:54:03.006
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll be right here, rushing to that same area.

03:54:03.006 --> 03:54:03.879
MATT: Okay.

03:54:03.879 --> 03:54:07.176
LAURA: I'm going to send my duplicate up in the action

03:54:07.176 --> 03:54:09.656
and I'm going to actually have
Jester stand right around here.

03:54:09.656 --> 03:54:11.229
MATT: So Jester's going to stand right about there--

03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:12.996
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: -- on the steps?

03:54:12.996 --> 03:54:14.986
Okay. Let me go ahead and take--

03:54:14.986 --> 03:54:16.466
LAURA: Just to make life difficult for you.

03:54:16.466 --> 03:54:18.076
MATT: I know. It's good.

03:54:18.076 --> 03:54:21.486
That's what I got putty for.

03:54:21.486 --> 03:54:22.886
All right. And the duplicate is--?

03:54:22.886 --> 03:54:24.346
LAURA: Up, heading into the action.

03:54:24.346 --> 03:54:25.486
MATT: Up here?
LAURA: Sure.

03:54:25.486 --> 03:54:28.383
MATT: All right. We'll say up there next to Beauregard.

03:54:28.383 --> 03:54:29.425
Veth, Yasha?

03:54:31.063 --> 03:54:33.666
SAM: Probably just emerged from the downstairs.

03:54:33.666 --> 03:54:36.312
Maybe just put me near one of those staircases.

03:54:36.312 --> 03:54:38.910
MATT: All right. Put you there.

03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:39.743
And Yasha?

03:54:39.743 --> 03:54:41.336
ASHLEY: Yeah. Same.

03:54:41.336 --> 03:54:44.376
I'll hop on that other side by, I think where Caleb--

03:54:44.376 --> 03:54:45.706
is that Caleb?

03:54:45.706 --> 03:54:46.539
MATT: Caleb is right there.

03:54:46.539 --> 03:54:48.046
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'll go on the other side of Caleb.

03:54:48.046 --> 03:54:48.879
MATT: Right there?

03:54:48.879 --> 03:54:52.006
LIAM: I'll actually go on the steps opposite Jester.

03:54:52.006 --> 03:54:52.839
MATT: Okay.

03:54:53.994 --> 03:54:55.494
LIAM: The other set.

03:54:59.797 --> 03:55:00.630
MATT: Perfect.

03:55:01.672 --> 03:55:06.536
All right. And then the rest of the crew here

03:55:06.536 --> 03:55:07.649
is up on this edge.

03:55:10.916 --> 03:55:12.889
SAM: Where's Marius?

03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:15.336
LAURA: (laughs) Where's a good Marius when you need him?

03:55:15.336 --> 03:55:19.011
MARISHA: He's dead already. Drowning, useless.

03:55:19.011 --> 03:55:20.836
SAM: He's the big bad of the campaign.

03:55:22.566 --> 03:55:23.890
ASHLEY: That'd be awesome.

03:55:23.890 --> 03:55:25.221
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:55:25.221 --> 03:55:27.491
TRAVIS: You thought I didn't kill.
MARISHA: He's in a mech suit,

03:55:27.491 --> 03:55:30.727
coming out of the ocean.
TRAVIS: Well, I do.

03:55:30.727 --> 03:55:33.465
SAM: You've insulted me for the last time.

03:55:33.465 --> 03:55:35.506
MARISHA: Holy shit!
MATT: All right.

03:55:35.506 --> 03:55:38.197
So. Everyone please roll initiative.

03:55:38.197 --> 03:55:39.030
TRAVIS: Yes!

03:55:40.064 --> 03:55:40.897
Drought is over!

03:55:40.897 --> 03:55:42.496
LAURA: God, I feel like I forget how to do this.

03:55:42.496 --> 03:55:44.063
MATT: I know it's been a while.
ASHLEY: I get advantage.

03:55:44.063 --> 03:55:45.138
LAURA: ♪ It's been a while ♪

03:55:46.466 --> 03:55:48.549
TALIESIN: Oh no.
MARISHA: Adding my boots.

03:55:50.476 --> 03:55:54.084
Yeah. All right, all right, all right.
SAM: No good?

03:55:55.164 --> 03:55:56.464
Poor Ashley.

03:55:56.464 --> 03:55:58.146
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: I'm worse.

03:55:58.146 --> 03:55:59.759
MATT: 25 to 20.

03:56:00.746 --> 03:56:03.950
MARISHA: 20. Uh-oh, okay.

03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:05.918
LIAM: Uh-oh.
MARISHA: Yep.

03:56:05.918 --> 03:56:07.234
MATT: 20 to 15.

03:56:08.126 --> 03:56:09.486
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
SAM: Ooh.

03:56:09.486 --> 03:56:10.319
MATT: Okay.

03:56:11.316 --> 03:56:12.666
MARISHA: Oh boy.
MATT: 15 to 10?

03:56:12.666 --> 03:56:14.766
TRAVIS: 14.
ASHLEY: 12.

03:56:14.766 --> 03:56:16.259
LIAM: Oh my.
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

03:56:17.786 --> 03:56:19.433
MARISHA: Oh. We're still--

03:56:20.864 --> 03:56:21.697
MATT: 10 to five?

03:56:21.697 --> 03:56:22.880
LIAM: <i>Acht</i>.

03:56:22.880 --> 03:56:24.726
SAM: Nine.
LAURA: Seven.

03:56:24.726 --> 03:56:26.311
MATT: All right. We have-

03:56:26.311 --> 03:56:27.584
LIAM: Seven, eight, nine.

03:56:27.584 --> 03:56:32.299
MATT: Veth, Caleb, and Jester.

03:56:33.256 --> 03:56:35.676
All righty. And Caduceus?

03:56:35.676 --> 03:56:36.969
TALIESIN: Three.
MATT: Oh, buddy.

03:56:38.416 --> 03:56:39.676
TALIESIN: It's better for the healer to go last.

03:56:39.676 --> 03:56:40.701
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yes.

03:56:40.701 --> 03:56:43.695
TALIESIN: I can undo anything terrible that happens.
LAURA: The healers are last.

03:56:43.695 --> 03:56:45.070
The healers.

03:56:45.916 --> 03:56:47.716
MATT: Okay, then.
LIAM: Fall and then make a decision.

03:56:47.716 --> 03:56:48.832
LAURA: (quietly) I'm not going to do any healing.

03:56:48.832 --> 03:56:53.830
MATT: Perfect. Top of the round is Beauregard and the crew.

03:56:55.096 --> 03:56:57.826
The crew that actually would be probably over here.

03:56:57.826 --> 03:57:01.306
haven't noticed yet and are in the process of battening down

03:57:01.306 --> 03:57:03.669
the weaponry from the storm.

03:57:04.736 --> 03:57:06.297
So they're just staying put for now.

03:57:06.297 --> 03:57:07.542
Beauregard, what are you doing?

03:57:09.136 --> 03:57:10.451
MARISHA: Oh boy. Okay.

03:57:10.451 --> 03:57:12.876
I see how many dudes?

03:57:12.876 --> 03:57:15.226
MATT: You see three coming up over that side of the ship.

03:57:15.226 --> 03:57:16.401
MARISHA: Three dudes.

03:57:17.934 --> 03:57:20.417
"Plus to attack and damage rolls." Okay.

03:57:20.417 --> 03:57:22.379
Sorry, just making sure.

03:57:24.294 --> 03:57:25.477
Okay.

03:57:25.477 --> 03:57:27.175
SAM: Lobster's on the menu.

03:57:27.175 --> 03:57:28.175
MARISHA: All right.

03:57:30.156 --> 03:57:32.740
I head towards the lobsters.

03:57:32.740 --> 03:57:34.984
MATT: Okay. Which one? Where?

03:57:36.545 --> 03:57:37.724
TALIESIN: Block me.

03:57:37.724 --> 03:57:41.336
MARISHA: I guess the closest lobster.

03:57:41.336 --> 03:57:44.456
MATT: 45, 50? You can get right there amongst--
SAM: The most intelligent.

03:57:44.456 --> 03:57:45.586
MATT: You can get within two of them, if you want.

03:57:45.586 --> 03:57:47.506
MARISHA: Yeah, is there a leader-looking lobster?

03:57:47.506 --> 03:57:49.066
TALIESIN: There's a lobster wearing like a--

03:57:49.066 --> 03:57:51.588
SAM: A little hat?
MATT: They're all pretty even, it seems.

03:57:51.588 --> 03:57:53.356
You either get in. between there

03:57:53.356 --> 03:57:55.349
or you can head up the stairs
and just go after this one there.

03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:56.826
Which would you prefer?
LIAM: We're more of a collective.

03:57:56.826 --> 03:57:58.836
MARISHA: The one that's closest to being a threat.

03:57:58.836 --> 03:58:00.291
Yeah, this one over there.

03:58:00.291 --> 03:58:01.976
MATT: Okay, got it.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:58:01.976 --> 03:58:03.416
That feels right. That feels right.

03:58:03.416 --> 03:58:04.249
MATT: Okay.

03:58:04.249 --> 03:58:05.512
LIAM: That looks like a terrible place to be.

03:58:05.512 --> 03:58:08.046
MARISHA: I take out my Belabor, which I--

03:58:08.046 --> 03:58:10.086
this might be the first time that I'm using it--

03:58:10.086 --> 03:58:11.826
and I hit a little awesome button

03:58:11.826 --> 03:58:14.654
and it goes (clicking) and pop, pop.

03:58:14.654 --> 03:58:15.720
MATT: Go for it.

03:58:18.346 --> 03:58:20.129
MARISHA: Yeah, okay. One of those is bad.

03:58:20.129 --> 03:58:20.962
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

03:58:23.366 --> 03:58:25.522
MARISHA: 27.
MATT: 27 hits.

03:58:25.522 --> 03:58:27.931
MARISHA: And 17.
MATT: 17 hits.

03:58:27.931 --> 03:58:28.764
MARISHA: Okay.

03:58:29.956 --> 03:58:34.179
1d8 plus 10, which is good.

03:58:34.179 --> 03:58:36.696
15 damage and 16 damage.

03:58:36.696 --> 03:58:38.496
MATT: All right. Nice.

03:58:38.496 --> 03:58:40.806
MARISHA: And for that first one--
MATT: Crack, crack!

03:58:40.806 --> 03:58:43.076
You hit the outside of its physical shell

03:58:43.076 --> 03:58:45.356
and you can see elements of it scrape off and break,

03:58:45.356 --> 03:58:46.999
but it's heavily armored.

03:58:48.536 --> 03:58:49.777
MARISHA: Is stunning this thing going to--

03:58:49.777 --> 03:58:51.156
whatever, Stunning Strike.

03:58:51.156 --> 03:58:52.056
MATT: Stunning Strike.

03:58:53.916 --> 03:58:56.786
That is a seven. That is a failure.

03:58:56.786 --> 03:58:58.546
MARISHA: Yeah, definitely fail.

03:58:58.546 --> 03:59:01.036
MATT: So this guy here is stunned.

03:59:01.036 --> 03:59:03.019
MARISHA: I'm going to turn my attention--

03:59:03.019 --> 03:59:05.535
is the other one nearby?

03:59:06.446 --> 03:59:07.509
Am I able to hit it?

03:59:10.111 --> 03:59:11.919
MATT: You can if you move through here,

03:59:11.919 --> 03:59:14.066
you can get to this one.

03:59:14.066 --> 03:59:15.786
MARISHA: I have enough movement to do that?

03:59:15.786 --> 03:59:17.896
MATT: You do, 'cause you're a monk.

03:59:17.896 --> 03:59:22.014
MARISHA: Yeah. All right. Bonus action. Pop pop.

03:59:22.014 --> 03:59:22.966
MATT: Go for it.

03:59:24.216 --> 03:59:27.029
MARISHA: Yeah, both of those definitely hit with a

03:59:28.014 --> 03:59:31.916
30 to hit and 27 again.

03:59:31.916 --> 03:59:33.716
MATT: Hits, damn.

03:59:33.716 --> 03:59:36.224
MARISHA: And then these are just my fists.

03:59:36.224 --> 03:59:38.207
Oh, which are d8s now.

03:59:38.207 --> 03:59:39.711
Need to make sure I remember that.

03:59:42.126 --> 03:59:43.146
Okay.

03:59:43.146 --> 03:59:47.721
That is 10 damage and eight damage.

03:59:47.721 --> 03:59:49.086
And stunning strike.

03:59:49.086 --> 03:59:51.726
MATT: Stunning strike again for that guy.

03:59:51.726 --> 03:59:54.134
Natural 20. So that's 23.
MARISHA: Lame.

03:59:54.134 --> 03:59:56.293
But Extract Aspects.

03:59:56.293 --> 03:59:57.406
MATT: Extract aspects.

03:59:57.406 --> 04:00:02.406
They are immune to poison and being poisoned.

04:00:02.461 --> 04:00:03.756
MARISHA: Okay.

04:00:03.756 --> 04:00:04.923
So I just shout out to the team:

04:00:04.923 --> 04:00:09.310
Don't try and poison them. They're kind of nasty.

04:00:09.310 --> 04:00:11.156
MATT: Finishing Beau's go; Fjord, you're up.

04:00:12.006 --> 04:00:16.465
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. I'll see Beau run up to all three of them

04:00:16.465 --> 04:00:20.687
like it's a party and I will join her at the bow.

04:00:22.036 --> 04:00:24.096
I'll run up as well.

04:00:24.096 --> 04:00:27.543
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

04:00:27.543 --> 04:00:29.461
You can get right about there on the stairs.

04:00:29.461 --> 04:00:30.914
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:00:30.914 --> 04:00:33.833
Wow. I'm not even that close, never mind.

04:00:33.833 --> 04:00:35.739
MATT: You're not quite the monk speed, unfortunately.

04:00:35.739 --> 04:00:39.630
TRAVIS: Ba bip bow! Eldritch Blast

04:00:39.630 --> 04:00:41.616
at the one that is stunned.

04:00:41.616 --> 04:00:42.626
MATT: You got it.

04:00:42.626 --> 04:00:44.859
TRAVIS: I'll do three of those.

04:00:48.366 --> 04:00:50.169
That is 20 to hit.

04:00:51.396 --> 04:00:53.216
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits.

04:00:53.216 --> 04:00:54.581
Attack rolls against it have advantage, by the way,

04:00:54.581 --> 04:00:55.743
because it's stunned.
TRAVIS: Oh!

04:00:55.743 --> 04:00:58.496
Well, that one was-- second one and it was less.

04:00:58.496 --> 04:01:02.854
Second one is a 25 to hit.

04:01:02.854 --> 04:01:06.966
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: The third one is,

04:01:06.966 --> 04:01:08.516
22 to hit.

04:01:08.516 --> 04:01:10.257
MATT: All hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

04:01:12.712 --> 04:01:13.945
TRAVIS: 11.

04:01:15.706 --> 04:01:16.609
25.

04:01:17.812 --> 04:01:18.937
SAM: Lots of rolling.

04:01:20.396 --> 04:01:24.243
TRAVIS: 36 points of Eldritch Blast damage.

04:01:24.243 --> 04:01:25.186
MATT: Nice!

04:01:25.186 --> 04:01:26.244
As it's there on the ground,

04:01:26.244 --> 04:01:28.779
recovering from the slamming from Beauregard,

04:01:28.779 --> 04:01:30.866
(unhappy clicking and gurgling)

04:01:30.866 --> 04:01:32.456
you release all three Eldritch Blasts.

04:01:32.456 --> 04:01:35.456
They going to arc up and over the stairway slamming into

04:01:35.456 --> 04:01:36.376
in the face.

04:01:36.376 --> 04:01:38.566
You see these black impacts are left across

04:01:38.566 --> 04:01:41.136
its normally water-drenched face where ice crystals

04:01:41.136 --> 04:01:43.177
have gathered, once it hit the frozen air.

04:01:43.177 --> 04:01:45.066
And as it does, one of its eyes

04:01:45.066 --> 04:01:46.156
bursts on one side.

04:01:46.156 --> 04:01:48.716
It has multiple eyes, so it doesn't really deter it.

04:01:48.716 --> 04:01:51.137
But as it does, it recoils

04:01:51.137 --> 04:01:53.232
and brings its claws up defensively in front of it.

04:01:53.232 --> 04:01:56.709
It looks pretty shaken by that display.

04:01:56.709 --> 04:01:58.255
TRAVIS: Nice.
MATT: Finishes your go?

04:01:58.255 --> 04:01:59.988
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

04:01:59.988 --> 04:02:01.961
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

04:02:01.961 --> 04:02:05.061
I would like to run up to them as fast as I can.

04:02:05.061 --> 04:02:07.327
I would like to run up to them as fast as I can.

04:02:07.327 --> 04:02:10.216
MATT: 30, 35, 40. What's your movement?

04:02:10.216 --> 04:02:11.941
ASHLEY: 50.

04:02:11.941 --> 04:02:16.577
MATT: 50. You can get up to the stairs there. Oh god.

04:02:16.577 --> 04:02:17.847
LIAM: Dang.

04:02:17.847 --> 04:02:19.655
ASHLEY: Maybe I will, then--

04:02:21.920 --> 04:02:23.461
Bee bee bee bee.

04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:27.664
TALIESIN: Can you move faster raging or no?

04:02:28.822 --> 04:02:29.655
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:02:30.896 --> 04:02:32.496
SAM: This is eerie battle music.
ASHLEY: I will--

04:02:32.496 --> 04:02:33.329
LAURA: I know.

04:02:34.646 --> 04:02:36.993
ASHLEY: Okay. I would like to rage.

04:02:36.993 --> 04:02:38.484
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yes!

04:02:41.694 --> 04:02:44.286
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's as close as I can get, huh?

04:02:44.286 --> 04:02:45.773
Okay. So then--

04:02:46.636 --> 04:02:47.843
MATT: You have your action still.

04:02:47.843 --> 04:02:51.445
So you could use your action to get all the way up there,

04:02:51.445 --> 04:02:55.299
or you could just stay put if you want to. Your call.

04:02:55.299 --> 04:02:57.755
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to get
all the way up there. Come on.

04:02:57.755 --> 04:02:58.755
MATT: All right.

04:03:02.346 --> 04:03:04.449
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay.
MATT: You got it.

04:03:05.526 --> 04:03:07.306
ASHLEY: Ready.
MATT: Okay.

04:03:07.306 --> 04:03:10.035
Finishing Yasha's go; it is now these creatures' turn.

04:03:10.035 --> 04:03:11.999
One of them is stunned and can't do anything.

04:03:12.896 --> 04:03:15.226
The one that's currently right in front of Beau and Yasha

04:03:15.226 --> 04:03:17.922
is going to go ahead and make its attacks against her.

04:03:17.922 --> 04:03:18.997
MARISHA: Against who?

04:03:18.997 --> 04:03:19.913
MATT: Against-- sorry.

04:03:19.913 --> 04:03:21.924
Against you since you're the one who's right there.

04:03:21.924 --> 04:03:22.757
MARISHA: All right.

04:03:23.640 --> 04:03:25.831
MATT: So the first strike.

04:03:25.831 --> 04:03:27.428
It's going to be 24 to hit.

04:03:27.428 --> 04:03:28.669
MARISHA: A-yep.

04:03:28.669 --> 04:03:31.663
MATT: Second one is natural 20. Holy shit. Okay.

04:03:31.663 --> 04:03:33.130
TALIESIN: Am I within 30 feet?

04:03:33.130 --> 04:03:35.888
MATT: You are--

04:03:35.888 --> 04:03:36.976
LIAM: Looks like it.

04:03:36.976 --> 04:03:39.425
MATT: Just out of it.
TALIESIN: Fuck. Never mind.

04:03:39.425 --> 04:03:42.075
MATT: Sorry. So the first hit against you, Beauregard,

04:03:44.367 --> 04:03:48.322
is 14 points of bludgeoning damage.

04:03:48.322 --> 04:03:49.280
MARISHA: Okay.

04:03:49.280 --> 04:03:52.465
MATT: And you are grappled as it grabs you in the claw.

04:03:53.365 --> 04:03:55.446
So you are now currently being held

04:03:55.446 --> 04:03:57.989
by the creature in one of its giant pincers.

04:03:57.989 --> 04:03:59.762
MARISHA: All right.

04:03:59.762 --> 04:04:01.042
MATT: The other one

04:04:04.069 --> 04:04:07.408
is 18 points of bludgeoning damage.

04:04:07.408 --> 04:04:10.090
That's the crit. It did not roll great for the damage.

04:04:10.090 --> 04:04:12.474
So be thankful on that, but nevertheless.

04:04:15.116 --> 04:04:17.241
There we go. Grappled.
LAURA: Oh no!

04:04:18.446 --> 04:04:22.016
MATT: And the one behind on
this point is going to go ahead and move.

04:04:22.016 --> 04:04:25.751
Skitter over to the side to go after Yasha.

04:04:25.751 --> 04:04:27.159
LAURA: (skittering noises)

04:04:27.159 --> 04:04:28.850
ASHLEY and LAURA: (skittering and clicking)

04:04:30.286 --> 04:04:32.456
LAURA: I don't like these guys.

04:04:32.456 --> 04:04:34.116
SAM: Nope. They're big.

04:04:34.116 --> 04:04:35.658
MATT: Two attacks against you, Yasha.

04:04:35.658 --> 04:04:36.932
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:04:36.932 --> 04:04:39.017
MATT: That is 24.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:04:39.017 --> 04:04:40.558
MATT: Rolling really well.

04:04:40.558 --> 04:04:43.977
And a 17.
ASHLEY: No.

04:04:43.977 --> 04:04:46.306
MATT: One strike swings towards you and grabs you.

04:04:46.306 --> 04:04:48.629
You are grappled from the first strike.

04:04:48.629 --> 04:04:51.207
The second one misses you,

04:04:51.207 --> 04:04:54.781
but you are currently being held in its claws. You take--

04:04:56.682 --> 04:04:57.866
Oof.

04:04:57.866 --> 04:04:59.509
16 points of bludgeoning damage.

04:05:00.616 --> 04:05:03.086
Halved, because you are raging, to eight.

04:05:03.086 --> 04:05:04.007
But you are currently grappled

04:05:04.007 --> 04:05:06.306
and held within its large pincer.

04:05:06.306 --> 04:05:07.736
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:05:07.736 --> 04:05:09.196
MATT: All right. That finishes their go.

04:05:09.196 --> 04:05:10.963
Veth, you're up, with Caleb on deck.

04:05:11.987 --> 04:05:12.820
SAM: Huh.

04:05:13.916 --> 04:05:16.466
It seems like they grab anyone who comes close,

04:05:16.466 --> 04:05:18.586
so maybe not that.

04:05:18.586 --> 04:05:21.516
I'll just take a couple of steps to my left

04:05:21.516 --> 04:05:24.376
and I will take some buttons out of my pocket

04:05:24.376 --> 04:05:27.406
and throw them into the air and cast a spell,

04:05:28.690 --> 04:05:30.880
turning the buttons

04:05:30.880 --> 04:05:34.171
into swirling, glowing...

04:05:35.068 --> 04:05:36.171
buttons.

04:05:36.171 --> 04:05:39.826
(laughter)

04:05:39.826 --> 04:05:40.693
MATT: Okay.

04:05:41.576 --> 04:05:43.656
SAM: Swirling buttons.

04:05:43.656 --> 04:05:46.276
I will cast Hypnotic Pattern.

04:05:46.276 --> 04:05:47.624
MATT: Oh!

04:05:47.624 --> 04:05:49.826
On a spot right in the middle of them.

04:05:49.826 --> 04:05:54.496
I don't care if it hits Beau. I don't care if it hits Yasha.

04:05:54.496 --> 04:05:58.216
I especially don't care if it hits Fjord.

04:05:58.216 --> 04:06:01.666
MATT: 30-foot cube. You could hit all of them,

04:06:01.666 --> 04:06:02.996
and if you really want to push it,

04:06:02.996 --> 04:06:04.270
you could probably hit Fjord, too,

04:06:04.270 --> 04:06:05.953
if you really want to.
SAM: No, I'll keep him out of it.

04:06:05.953 --> 04:06:07.981
MATT: But you don't need to.

04:06:07.981 --> 04:06:09.246
TRAVIS: That's called character growth.

04:06:09.246 --> 04:06:10.126
MATT: Okay.

04:06:10.126 --> 04:06:13.964
So I need both Yasha and Beauregard to make

04:06:13.964 --> 04:06:15.713
a wisdom saving throw, please.

04:06:15.713 --> 04:06:16.629
TALIESIN: Oh no.

04:06:17.820 --> 04:06:19.476
ASHLEY: My specialty.
MARISHA: Yasha.

04:06:19.476 --> 04:06:20.609
SAM: I feel like you're raging

04:06:20.609 --> 04:06:22.756
and that you can't be charmed. Is that true?

04:06:22.756 --> 04:06:25.100
MATT: That doesn't work for her barbarian type,

04:06:25.100 --> 04:06:26.583
unfortunately.
MARISHA: Natural one.

04:06:26.583 --> 04:06:29.161
TRAVIS: Oh wow.
LIAM: Nice.

04:06:29.161 --> 04:06:30.742
ASHLEY: 18.

04:06:30.742 --> 04:06:31.864
TRAVIS: Let's go, fam!

04:06:31.864 --> 04:06:33.022
MARISHA: Role reversal!
MATT: So you succeed.

04:06:33.022 --> 04:06:35.823
Beauregard, you are charmed.

04:06:35.823 --> 04:06:38.203
MARISHA: Yeah, but I can

04:06:38.203 --> 04:06:39.231
use an action to end the charm.

04:06:39.231 --> 04:06:41.136
SAM: It's a monk thing; you can't be charmed.

04:06:41.136 --> 04:06:42.460
MARISHA: I can use an action.
SAM: It's got to be a monk thing.

04:06:42.460 --> 04:06:44.076
MARISHA: I can use an action to do it.

04:06:44.076 --> 04:06:47.496
MATT: However, you are incapacitated while charmed with

04:06:47.496 --> 04:06:49.976
a speed of zero so you do not get actions.

04:06:49.976 --> 04:06:52.886
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh no!

04:06:52.886 --> 04:06:55.053
MARISHA: Wait, how does that work then?

04:06:55.053 --> 04:06:57.144
LIAM: Just like that.

04:06:57.144 --> 04:06:59.336
MATT: Other charms, you still have your action,

04:06:59.336 --> 04:07:01.886
but this particular ability, this spell,

04:07:01.886 --> 04:07:03.996
does not give you actions while you're charmed.

04:07:03.996 --> 04:07:07.211
You're essentially standing there.
You're in its claw going--

04:07:07.211 --> 04:07:09.671
SAM: Literally everything that happens to you, you're like,

04:07:09.671 --> 04:07:12.693
"Monk, I can undo it." Except for this?!

04:07:12.693 --> 04:07:14.046
MARISHA: Buttons are pretty.

04:07:14.046 --> 04:07:15.476
MATT: Fail.

04:07:15.476 --> 04:07:16.792
This guy's no longer--

04:07:16.792 --> 04:07:18.766
or he's stunned until the end of your next turn, so.

04:07:18.766 --> 04:07:20.886
Other one, natural one, fail.

04:07:20.886 --> 04:07:22.286
LAURA: Okay.

04:07:22.286 --> 04:07:23.776
MATT: And that is a

04:07:25.186 --> 04:07:26.722
14. What's your spell DC?

04:07:26.722 --> 04:07:29.006
SAM: 16.
MATT: 16. They're all charmed.

04:07:29.006 --> 04:07:31.361
MARISHA: Okay. That's good.
MATT: And incapacitated.

04:07:32.446 --> 04:07:34.276
SAM: So they can't move?
TRAVIS: All three?

04:07:34.276 --> 04:07:36.126
MATT: They can't move. They can't take actions--

04:07:36.126 --> 04:07:38.656
TRAVIS: That's huge.
MATT: -- and for as long as it is--

04:07:38.656 --> 04:07:41.351
TRAVIS: She was fucked.
SAM: Yeah.

04:07:41.351 --> 04:07:43.466
Plus, we can go grab her body and just, like,

04:07:43.466 --> 04:07:44.479
slide it out.

04:07:45.606 --> 04:07:48.191
MATT: All righty. Finishes your turn, Veth.

04:07:49.066 --> 04:07:50.749
Right? You moved,

04:07:50.749 --> 04:07:52.486
you cast your spell.

04:07:52.486 --> 04:07:54.309
SAM: As a bonus action, I will just--

04:07:55.546 --> 04:07:57.896
I'll charge up my old

04:07:59.054 --> 04:08:02.487
Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.

04:08:02.487 --> 04:08:04.626
MATT: Can't cast two spells in
one round unless one's a cantrip.

04:08:04.626 --> 04:08:07.966
SAM: Well then, in that case, I will bonus action

04:08:07.966 --> 04:08:11.196
dash. No, I'll just, I'll patient defense.

04:08:11.196 --> 04:08:12.029
Can I do that?

04:08:12.029 --> 04:08:12.864
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: Nope.

04:08:12.864 --> 04:08:14.055
SAM: (laughs) Shit.

04:08:14.055 --> 04:08:15.886
(laughter)

04:08:15.886 --> 04:08:18.163
SAM: I'll hide behind the ballista.

04:08:18.163 --> 04:08:20.610
MATT: Hide behind this ballista here?

04:08:20.610 --> 04:08:23.667
LAURA: How are we this level and you have no idea?

04:08:23.667 --> 04:08:26.241
SAM: I just-- I don't know.
TRAVIS: It happens. It happens.

04:08:26.241 --> 04:08:27.074
TALIESIN: That's how long it takes you

04:08:27.074 --> 04:08:28.345
to regret everything.
MARISHA: He wants to be a monk so bad.

04:08:28.345 --> 04:08:29.520
SAM: They're so cool!

04:08:29.520 --> 04:08:31.373
MATT: So you're using the rest of your movement to go behind

04:08:31.373 --> 04:08:32.614
the ballista and you're attempting to hide?

04:08:32.614 --> 04:08:33.762
SAM: Yes.
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me.

04:08:33.762 --> 04:08:34.810
LAURA: Oh my god.

04:08:34.810 --> 04:08:36.218
MATT: Caleb, you're coming up.
TRAVIS: If only we had a software program

04:08:36.218 --> 04:08:38.218
SAM: A lot.
TRAVIS: -- that had bonus actions.

04:08:38.218 --> 04:08:39.051
SAM: 34.

04:08:39.051 --> 04:08:41.350
MATT: Okay. Caleb, you're up.

04:08:41.350 --> 04:08:43.929
LIAM: Man. That changed everything I wanted to do.

04:08:43.929 --> 04:08:45.606
Can I-- from where I am,

04:08:45.606 --> 04:08:49.396
can I see Beauregard looking like she got the whammy,

04:08:49.396 --> 04:08:50.986
or is that impossible to see?

04:08:50.986 --> 04:08:54.013
MATT: With your passive perception, I'd say,

04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:58.382
I'd say at 19, yeah. You can tell.

04:08:58.382 --> 04:08:59.718
You can see the entire group, like,

04:08:59.718 --> 04:09:02.146
there's this big flash of light and color,

04:09:02.146 --> 04:09:03.851
this weird pattern, like a bunch

04:09:03.851 --> 04:09:07.126
patterned lights start blinking in that space.

04:09:07.126 --> 04:09:10.296
And as it does, you watch Yasha duck out of the way,

04:09:10.296 --> 04:09:12.479
closing her eyes. All three of the creatures begin to like--

04:09:12.479 --> 04:09:13.712
(slow clicking)

04:09:13.712 --> 04:09:15.256
and stand there weirdly staring

04:09:15.256 --> 04:09:17.376
and Beauregard has gone from struggling

04:09:17.376 --> 04:09:19.536
to just limply staying within its grasp.

04:09:19.536 --> 04:09:21.604
LIAM: Okay. Then I will--

04:09:21.604 --> 04:09:24.246
All right, so peering through and seeing her looking

04:09:24.246 --> 04:09:26.186
like she took the whammy, instead of moving back,

04:09:26.186 --> 04:09:28.455
like I was going to do, I'm going to move forward

04:09:28.455 --> 04:09:32.226
and I'm going to cast Dispel Magic on her.

04:09:32.226 --> 04:09:33.231
MATT: On her? Okay.

04:09:33.231 --> 04:09:34.064
SAM: Ooh.

04:09:34.064 --> 04:09:35.152
MARISHA: Thanks, friend.

04:09:35.152 --> 04:09:38.616
MATT: As you do that, the effect drops from her.

04:09:38.616 --> 04:09:41.576
You are no longer charmed. You're still grappled.

04:09:41.576 --> 04:09:45.051
SAM: And all of your magic items are now destroyed.

04:09:45.051 --> 04:09:46.730
MATT: (laughs)

04:09:46.730 --> 04:09:48.566
MARISHA: What the fuck, dude?

04:09:48.566 --> 04:09:50.219
LIAM: I cast Disintegrate.

04:09:50.219 --> 04:09:54.066
(laughter)

04:09:54.066 --> 04:09:55.286
MATT: Perfect.

04:09:55.286 --> 04:09:56.649
Are you staying where you are?

04:09:57.596 --> 04:10:00.436
LIAM: I'll move-- yeah, I actually wanted to move first.

04:10:00.436 --> 04:10:02.196
I'll be on top of the

04:10:02.196 --> 04:10:04.286
grate in the center of the ship there.

04:10:04.286 --> 04:10:05.496
MATT: Here?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

04:10:05.496 --> 04:10:07.332
MATT: Okay. You got it.

04:10:07.332 --> 04:10:08.681
Finishing that go--
SAM: I'm right next to you, Caleb.

04:10:08.681 --> 04:10:10.955
MATT: Jester, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.
SAM: You can't see me, because I'm hiding.

04:10:12.414 --> 04:10:14.613
LAURA: We can't harm them. Right?

04:10:14.613 --> 04:10:15.563
SAM: If you do, they'll wake up.

04:10:15.563 --> 04:10:17.626
But you can certainly harm them.
LAURA: How long does it last?

04:10:17.626 --> 04:10:20.045
SAM: Until you harm them.
MATT: It lasts for up to one minute,

04:10:20.045 --> 04:10:22.299
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Until they're harmed.

04:10:22.299 --> 04:10:23.752
Or Veth drops concentration.

04:10:23.752 --> 04:10:26.906
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to send my duplicate

04:10:26.906 --> 04:10:29.346
to where she's up and in close proximity,

04:10:29.346 --> 04:10:31.987
like touchable to all three of them, or two.

04:10:31.987 --> 04:10:33.561
MATT: All three, you can't do, but two of them you can.

04:10:33.561 --> 04:10:34.976
LAURA: Then two of them at a time. Yeah, sure.

04:10:34.976 --> 04:10:36.046
However, I can be to--

04:10:36.046 --> 04:10:38.654
MATT: Drift about there is where you'd want to,

04:10:38.654 --> 04:10:40.566
catty-corner to where Beauregard is grappled.

04:10:40.566 --> 04:10:43.316
LAURA: Okay. And I'm going to cast

04:10:45.315 --> 04:10:47.246
Spiritual Weapon.

04:10:47.246 --> 04:10:48.079
MATT: Okay.

04:10:48.079 --> 04:10:48.912
LAURA: At...

04:10:51.695 --> 04:10:53.270
5th-level.

04:10:54.576 --> 04:10:55.409
MATT: All righty.

04:10:57.466 --> 04:10:58.516
Where do you want it?

04:11:00.446 --> 04:11:03.416
LAURA: Right above the one that's holding Beau.

04:11:03.416 --> 04:11:05.023
MATT: Okay. So we'll say about--

04:11:06.354 --> 04:11:08.062
SAM: Don't kill Beau.

04:11:10.656 --> 04:11:12.448
MATT: Okay. Is that your turn?

04:11:12.448 --> 04:11:14.889
LAURA: Oh, I guess that's a bonus.

04:11:17.786 --> 04:11:20.194
MATT: You have an action to do a cantrip

04:11:20.194 --> 04:11:21.927
or to just move.

04:11:21.927 --> 04:11:23.266
LAURA: Can I prep?

04:11:23.266 --> 04:11:24.276
Oh no. That's 'cause--

04:11:24.276 --> 04:11:28.351
I'll hold Toll the Dead

04:11:28.351 --> 04:11:30.134
until they start moving.

04:11:30.134 --> 04:11:33.124
If it happens before my turn.

04:11:33.124 --> 04:11:37.572
MATT: Okay. Towards who?

04:11:37.572 --> 04:11:38.601
LAURA: The one holding Beau.

04:11:38.601 --> 04:11:39.767
MATT: The one holding Beau. You got it.

04:11:39.767 --> 04:11:41.367
Jester's turn's done. Caduceus, you're up.

04:11:41.367 --> 04:11:44.333
TALIESIN: So if I cast an effect on them

04:11:44.333 --> 04:11:45.291
that doesn't cause damage,

04:11:45.291 --> 04:11:47.737
that shouldn't interrupt the spell, correct?

04:11:50.086 --> 04:11:52.218
MATT: If you cast a spell that does not do damage?

04:11:52.218 --> 04:11:53.752
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah. That wouldn't interrupt the spell.

04:11:53.752 --> 04:11:56.573
TALIESIN: Oh, then I'm going to walk up just close enough

04:11:56.573 --> 04:11:58.176
to cast Bane on all three of them.

04:11:58.176 --> 04:11:59.356
TRAVIS: Bless you.
SAM: Nice.

04:11:59.356 --> 04:12:01.046
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: That's a different spell.

04:12:01.046 --> 04:12:03.156
MATT: Do they get saves on that, right?

04:12:03.156 --> 04:12:05.746
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a charisma save.

04:12:05.746 --> 04:12:08.364
MATT: Charisma save. (cackles)

04:12:09.286 --> 04:12:10.119
TRAVIS: Super high.

04:12:10.119 --> 04:12:11.760
MATT: That's a fail.

04:12:13.606 --> 04:12:17.838
That's a fail. Negative one, zero, and--

04:12:19.523 --> 04:12:22.189
That's actually a high roll, but with their penalty, no.

04:12:22.189 --> 04:12:24.476
So they are all baned.
MARISHA: But they seem so charming.

04:12:24.476 --> 04:12:26.143
TALIESIN: They seem so charming.

04:12:26.143 --> 04:12:27.492
LIAM: You spooky motherfucker.

04:12:27.492 --> 04:12:30.576
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to back up as much as I can.

04:12:30.576 --> 04:12:32.563
I'm going to get that in there and then I'm going to back up

04:12:32.563 --> 04:12:34.085
and head towards the center of the boat, too,

04:12:34.085 --> 04:12:35.348
because I don't trust that more of these things

04:12:35.348 --> 04:12:36.278
aren't going to show up.

04:12:36.278 --> 04:12:38.886
TRAVIS: It is a crowded-ass bow of the ship.
LAURA: Yeah.

04:12:38.886 --> 04:12:39.719
MATT: 30, about there?

04:12:39.719 --> 04:12:42.035
LIAM: ♪ On the bow of the ship ♪

04:12:42.035 --> 04:12:44.346
TALIESIN: Not quite that far back, actually.

04:12:44.346 --> 04:12:46.261
MATT: Like there?
TALIESIN: Yeah. I want to be able to-- yeah.

04:12:46.261 --> 04:12:49.013
So I can grab onto the

04:12:49.013 --> 04:12:51.204
ballista if things go shitty.

04:12:51.204 --> 04:12:53.979
MATT: You've got it. Okay.

04:12:55.616 --> 04:12:58.032
So end of the round.

04:12:59.116 --> 04:13:00.582
Top of the next round.

04:13:02.150 --> 04:13:03.936
You hear some shouts from behind.

04:13:03.936 --> 04:13:06.499
"Ah!"
LIAM: Yes. Knew it.

04:13:06.499 --> 04:13:07.416
LAURA: That makes sense.
SAM: Round two.

04:13:07.416 --> 04:13:09.616
MATT: This crew's going to run down this way

04:13:09.616 --> 04:13:12.046
and the captain is going to back around

04:13:12.046 --> 04:13:15.462
the other side of the wheel, (panting),

04:13:17.004 --> 04:13:21.108
as a creature here begins to walk up--

04:13:21.108 --> 04:13:23.742
SAM: It's a different creature.
MATT: -- to the edge.

04:13:23.742 --> 04:13:25.042
LIAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Uh oh!

04:13:25.042 --> 04:13:29.855
MATT: You see a humanoid figure step up to the side,

04:13:29.855 --> 04:13:32.004
this grayish-blue,

04:13:32.004 --> 04:13:34.644
almost blubbery, smooth skin.

04:13:34.644 --> 04:13:38.637
You see these, their hair comes down
to these long tentacle-like tendrils

04:13:38.637 --> 04:13:42.114
and the mouth itself is partially open.

04:13:42.114 --> 04:13:44.262
A familiar creature you've encountered once before.

04:13:44.262 --> 04:13:45.885
LIAM: Same mini.

04:13:45.885 --> 04:13:47.676
LAURA: Oh no.

04:13:47.676 --> 04:13:48.621
TRAVIS: Don't look over at me.

04:13:48.621 --> 04:13:49.454
MATT: As it--

04:13:49.454 --> 04:13:51.229
(laughter)

04:13:51.229 --> 04:13:54.200
MATT: As you see it peering over and

04:13:54.200 --> 04:13:56.348
holding a small crystal in its hand, it goes--

04:13:58.540 --> 04:14:02.502
across the front of the boat and goes (chuckles).

04:14:03.896 --> 04:14:06.066
Puts a finger forward.
SAM: Oh no.

04:14:06.066 --> 04:14:08.306
MATT: The amber necklace you have around your body,

04:14:08.306 --> 04:14:11.874
just shatters, dispelled, and all the contents

04:14:11.874 --> 04:14:15.453
(thudding) onto the deck of the ship.
TRAVIS: <i>Oh fuck</i>!

04:14:15.453 --> 04:14:17.861
Oh shit.
MATT: Scattering and spilling

04:14:17.861 --> 04:14:20.943
out into the space of the wood and ice, all over.

04:14:20.943 --> 04:14:22.659
MARISHA: Wait, doesn't it have a lot of our shit?

04:14:22.659 --> 04:14:26.094
LIAM: It's got the fucking cloven crystal...

04:14:26.094 --> 04:14:28.494
and a shit ton of fireworks!

04:14:28.494 --> 04:14:30.252
(cheering)

04:14:30.252 --> 04:14:32.010
MARISHA: Oh-- oh.

04:14:32.010 --> 04:14:35.678
(laughter)

04:14:35.678 --> 04:14:37.306
TRAVIS: Can you point to where Caleb is, please?

04:14:37.306 --> 04:14:39.310
MATT: Yes, right there.
LIAM: Center of the ship. Center.

04:14:41.566 --> 04:14:43.342
MATT: As you're up on the staircase,

04:14:43.342 --> 04:14:45.746
you hear the shouts and look over and you see this creature

04:14:45.746 --> 04:14:49.186
out of the corner of your eye and the necklace shatter,

04:14:49.186 --> 04:14:51.126
and you watch, as amongst all the rummage

04:14:51.126 --> 04:14:52.506
that falls to the ground scattering,

04:14:52.506 --> 04:14:55.316
you see the one little yellow orb,

04:14:56.457 --> 04:14:59.357
roll off to this direction.

04:14:59.357 --> 04:15:00.688
SAM: Is the ship, like--

04:15:00.688 --> 04:15:02.656
MATT: And right as you're having this,

04:15:02.656 --> 04:15:05.398
you hear something go, "Psst," to your right side

04:15:05.398 --> 04:15:06.891
and you look over

04:15:06.891 --> 04:15:10.221
and just pulling up on the side of the boat,

04:15:10.221 --> 04:15:13.703
you see a humanoid figure with ice clusters gathered

04:15:13.703 --> 04:15:15.632
around its shoulders.

04:15:15.632 --> 04:15:17.912
You see this large brimmed hat--

04:15:17.912 --> 04:15:18.748
LIAM: It's her!

04:15:18.748 --> 04:15:20.858
MATT: -- and this plume of feathers,

04:15:20.858 --> 04:15:25.346
pale-ish skin with a twisted, broken semblance on the neck.

04:15:25.346 --> 04:15:27.954
The eyes glowing faintly blue--

04:15:27.954 --> 04:15:29.359
LIAM: Yes!
MARISHA: Oh my god!

04:15:29.359 --> 04:15:33.800
MATT: -- as you see the visage of Captain Avantika go--

04:15:33.800 --> 04:15:36.224
ALL: Oh!

04:15:36.224 --> 04:15:38.805
MATT: "Darling, we have business elsewhere."

04:15:38.805 --> 04:15:39.805
TRAVIS: No!

04:15:39.805 --> 04:15:41.513
MATT: And is going to grab towards you.

04:15:41.513 --> 04:15:42.721
LIAM: Crazy ex-girlfriend.

04:15:42.721 --> 04:15:43.996
MARISHA: Oh shit.

04:15:44.946 --> 04:15:46.320
MATT: Hold on a second.

04:15:46.320 --> 04:15:48.254
SAM: You fucked her.
ASHLEY: Holy mackerel.

04:15:49.169 --> 04:15:50.160
TRAVIS: Well, yeah!

04:15:51.347 --> 04:15:52.277
SAM: You shouldn't've!

04:15:52.277 --> 04:15:55.585
TRAVIS: I was trying to keep our enemies close!

04:15:55.585 --> 04:15:57.004
TALIESIN: I warned you.

04:15:57.004 --> 04:15:58.345
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

04:15:59.825 --> 04:16:01.350
Oh no.

04:16:01.350 --> 04:16:02.760
SAM: Was it worth it for that?

04:16:02.760 --> 04:16:03.954
LIAM: I encouraged you.

04:16:03.954 --> 04:16:05.679
TRAVIS: Most def.
LAURA: Oh no.

04:16:05.679 --> 04:16:06.512
ASHLEY: Oh no.

04:16:06.512 --> 04:16:08.963
MATT: All right. So this is going to be--

04:16:08.963 --> 04:16:10.269
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

04:16:11.366 --> 04:16:12.836
LIAM: Awesome.

04:16:12.836 --> 04:16:14.806
SAM: So wait, what fell out of your necklace?

04:16:14.806 --> 04:16:18.086
LIAM: His tummy stone and a ton of fireworks.

04:16:18.086 --> 04:16:19.819
SAM: It's just rolling around on the deck?!

04:16:19.819 --> 04:16:21.377
LIAM: Yes!
TRAVIS: "Tummy stone."

04:16:22.286 --> 04:16:24.411
MARISHA: And fucking fireworks. Use those.

04:16:24.411 --> 04:16:27.044
SAM: Tummy sticks, oh no.
LAURA: All of the fireworks.

04:16:27.044 --> 04:16:29.126
All of the fireworks.

04:16:29.126 --> 04:16:31.593
MATT: Make a strength check for me, Fjord.

04:16:31.593 --> 04:16:33.666
ASHLEY: Wait, was anything else in there, or that's it?

04:16:33.666 --> 04:16:34.991
LIAM: Right now, that's it.
TRAVIS: Strength check.

04:16:34.991 --> 04:16:36.824
MATT: Just roll a d20 and add your strength modifier.

04:16:36.824 --> 04:16:40.039
SAM: Fireworks and the most important relic of our past.

04:16:40.039 --> 04:16:41.326
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

04:16:41.326 --> 04:16:42.751
MATT: No shit!

04:16:44.006 --> 04:16:45.806
TRAVIS: Natural 20 for a 21.

04:16:45.806 --> 04:16:47.231
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laughing)

04:16:47.231 --> 04:16:48.672
MATT: You lucky fucker.

04:16:48.672 --> 04:16:50.363
TRAVIS: (laughs) Uh-huh!

04:16:50.363 --> 04:16:52.486
MATT: So--
TRAVIS: With the Fjord dice.

04:16:52.486 --> 04:16:54.044
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:16:54.044 --> 04:16:55.807
TRAVIS: Oh man.
LAURA: That's the Uk'otoa dice.

04:16:55.807 --> 04:16:57.676
TRAVIS: That is the Uk'otoa dice.

04:16:57.676 --> 04:16:58.933
LAURA and SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

04:16:58.933 --> 04:17:03.749
MATT: The currently undead form

04:17:03.749 --> 04:17:05.120
of Avantika.

04:17:05.120 --> 04:17:07.112
SAM: Undead Avantika.
TRAVIS: I'm dying.

04:17:07.112 --> 04:17:10.176
MATT: Sits on the edge, we'll say right there.
ASHLEY: Undeadika.

04:17:10.176 --> 04:17:11.255
MATT: I'll deal with that.

04:17:11.255 --> 04:17:12.886
MARISHA: Jeez, okay.

04:17:12.886 --> 04:17:14.229
MATT: Grabs your your arm and is attempting

04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:16.705
to throw you overboard,

04:17:16.705 --> 04:17:19.213
and you resist and pull your grasp away.

04:17:20.476 --> 04:17:23.451
And as you do, she goes, "Interesting."

04:17:25.050 --> 04:17:28.316
And pulls out two blades. You see in one hand,

04:17:28.316 --> 04:17:32.126
this blackened metal hooked dagger that comes to a point

04:17:32.126 --> 04:17:33.946
and then hooks back underneath.

04:17:33.946 --> 04:17:35.416
And in the other is this rapier,

04:17:35.416 --> 04:17:37.446
but the rapier itself has this weird,

04:17:37.446 --> 04:17:39.955
tentacle-like spiral up the center of the blade.

04:17:40.846 --> 04:17:42.321
where it comes and gathers around the base,

04:17:42.321 --> 04:17:46.188
you can see barnacles and jagged, crystal-like glass.

04:17:48.235 --> 04:17:49.234
"It's been a while."

04:17:49.234 --> 04:17:50.067
LAURA: Oh no.

04:17:51.289 --> 04:17:52.313
MATT: And that's where we're going to pick up next time.

04:17:52.313 --> 04:17:54.212
ALL: No!

04:17:54.212 --> 04:17:55.861
LIAM: Right in the middle of the fight?!

04:17:55.861 --> 04:17:56.902
MATT: I know, but it's--

04:17:56.902 --> 04:17:58.493
TRAVIS and MARISHA: It is late.

04:17:58.493 --> 04:18:00.093
MATT: It's pretty late.

04:18:00.093 --> 04:18:03.246
We'll pick up from the top of the combat round.

04:18:03.246 --> 04:18:05.174
MARISHA: With me? With me? Is it Beau?

04:18:05.174 --> 04:18:06.866
TRAVIS: It's the top.
MARISHA: Oh boy, oh boy.

04:18:06.866 --> 04:18:07.722
MATT: So you are next.

04:18:07.722 --> 04:18:09.080
MARISHA: Okay. Can you, before we close,

04:18:09.080 --> 04:18:10.663
can you just give me, like,

04:18:10.663 --> 04:18:13.478
I'm having a hard time seeing who's where.

04:18:13.478 --> 04:18:15.260
Can you do a little point out, call out thing?

04:18:15.260 --> 04:18:17.017
LIAM: Pile of lobsters.
MATT: No worries.

04:18:17.017 --> 04:18:18.575
MARISHA: I'm in a pile of lobsters.

04:18:18.575 --> 04:18:19.994
MATT: You are in a pile of lobsters.

04:18:19.994 --> 04:18:21.721
LIAM: I want to play so bad right now.

04:18:21.721 --> 04:18:22.554
TRAVIS: I'll appeal.

04:18:22.554 --> 04:18:24.695
I'll appeal to her feminine wiles.
LAURA: Sure.

04:18:24.695 --> 04:18:25.603
SAM: Just flirt with her.

04:18:25.603 --> 04:18:26.436
TRAVIS: Yeah!

04:18:26.436 --> 04:18:27.356
SAM: That'll catch her off guard.

04:18:27.356 --> 04:18:28.397
LIAM: You're the face.

04:18:28.397 --> 04:18:30.163
TRAVIS: I'll give her a kiss and it'll be like in the movies

04:18:30.163 --> 04:18:31.715
and all the ice will melt.

04:18:31.715 --> 04:18:34.298
SAM: (grunts) You'll run your blade

04:18:34.298 --> 04:18:35.757
through her during the kiss?
MATT: Beau's right there.

04:18:35.757 --> 04:18:37.004
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Yasha's there.

04:18:37.004 --> 04:18:38.378
LIAM: Goddamn it.
TRAVIS: That's a Game of Thrones--

04:18:38.378 --> 04:18:40.832
MATT: That's Jester's ability, Jester's form.

04:18:40.832 --> 04:18:42.027
LAURA: That's my duplicate.

04:18:42.027 --> 04:18:44.938
MATT: Duplicate. So Beau, Yasha, duplicate,

04:18:44.938 --> 04:18:46.543
creature, creature, creature.

04:18:46.543 --> 04:18:48.481
LAURA: Where's my spiritual weapon?

04:18:48.481 --> 04:18:50.047
MATT: Your spiritual weapon is towards the very back,

04:18:50.047 --> 04:18:50.934
near the front of the ship.

04:18:50.934 --> 04:18:53.075
SAM: Wait, we killed Avantika.

04:18:53.075 --> 04:18:54.236
MATT: You didn't kill Avantika.

04:18:54.236 --> 04:18:56.356
TRAVIS: The Plank King did.
MATT: The Plank King did.

04:18:56.356 --> 04:18:58.406
TRAVIS: Snapped her neck.
MARISHA: Snapped her neck.

04:18:58.406 --> 04:19:02.971
SAM: Like, is Uk'otoa here? Are we fighting Uk'otoa now?

04:19:02.971 --> 04:19:06.006
LAURA: She's definitely working for Uk'otoa now.

04:19:06.006 --> 04:19:08.233
TRAVIS: They only need this thing to let him out

04:19:08.233 --> 04:19:11.858
MATT: You carry the most important artifact

04:19:11.858 --> 04:19:13.360
in the entirety--
SAM: Not carrying it anymore.

04:19:13.360 --> 04:19:15.666
It's rolling around the deck.
MATT: Well, you were carrying.

04:19:15.666 --> 04:19:16.784
LAURA: Oh my god.

04:19:16.784 --> 04:19:19.435
TRAVIS: I thought that thing was unbreakable or something.

04:19:19.435 --> 04:19:23.301
LIAM: We've gone months without combat and we got one round.

04:19:23.301 --> 04:19:25.373
MARISHA: Wow. Wowsers.

04:19:25.373 --> 04:19:26.281
SAM: I need it.

04:19:26.281 --> 04:19:27.747
MATT: We'll pick up there next time.

04:19:27.747 --> 04:19:28.589
ASHLEY: Ugh.

04:19:28.589 --> 04:19:31.955
MATT: So on that note,

04:19:32.926 --> 04:19:35.896
thank you all so much. I'm going to sit down, actually.

04:19:35.896 --> 04:19:38.410
SAM: That game was a Sam dunk.

04:19:38.410 --> 04:19:39.496
MATT: Goddamn it, Sam.

04:19:39.496 --> 04:19:43.456
(laughter)

04:19:43.456 --> 04:19:45.016
MATT: Thank you all so much for joining us.

04:19:45.016 --> 04:19:48.666
We'll pick up with this insane combat next week,

04:19:48.666 --> 04:19:52.066
but we love you very much. And is it Thursday yet?

04:19:52.066 --> 04:19:52.899
Good night.

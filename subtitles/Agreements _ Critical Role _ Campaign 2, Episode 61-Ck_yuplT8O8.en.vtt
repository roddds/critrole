1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.150
MATT: Everyone and welcome

2
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.560
to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.070
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.323
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:10.788
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:14.070
MATT: All right. Before we get into tonight's game,

7
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.940
we have a few announcements to get through.

8
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.910
First and foremost, we have two sponsors

9
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.720
for the evening. Our first up

10
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.640
is our long time friend of campaign two,

11
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.460
our returning sponsors D&amp;D Beyond.

12
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.629
Sam, if you don't mind.

13
00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:29.190
SAM: The great thing about D&amp;D Beyond

14
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.420
everybody is it's all about accuracy, right?

15
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.460
They can handle the stats for you,

16
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.080
they can handle calculating damage,

17
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.880
adding bonuses, ability checks, all that stuff.

18
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.910
It's super duper accurate, something that I,

19
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.040
Sam Riegel, as a candidate for president,

20
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.920
am hyper-focused on, accuracy.

21
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.690
But a couple of weeks ago, my opponents,

22
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.770
O'Brien and Johnson, said some slanderous

23
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.830
things about me that were not accurate.

24
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.553
I wanted to set the record straight tonight.

25
00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:04.138
Ashley Johnson said that I had lily-white hands

26
00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:06.740
that had never worked a day in their lives.

27
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.440
Inaccurate.

28
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.270
It's at least not the whole picture.

29
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.420
The whole picture is my entire body is as

30
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.842
doughy as Val Kilmer in a funnel cake factory.

31
00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:20.960
(laughter)

32
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.790
She accused me of looking like a donkey

33
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.890
wearing a Jeff Goldblum mask, also inaccurate.

34
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130
My face is much more like a Steve Buscemi

35
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.818
Halloween mask that has melted in the back seat

36
00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:32.470
of your Kia.

37
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.610
Johnson said that my smile made you want to drown

38
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.210
yourself in hot goat piss, not accurate.

39
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.640
It's my voice that makes you want to drown

40
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.290
me out with a stereo mix of Limp Bizkit

41
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.285
and Michelle Wolf.

42
00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:48.637
TALIESIN: Wow!

43
00:01:48.637 --> 00:01:49.740
SAM: The members of the O'Brien-Johnson campaign

44
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.980
build themselves as honest, nice D&amp;D players,

45
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.090
but if we're being accurate, Liam isn't nice.

46
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.860
He's an authoritarian party pooper

47
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.650
whose characters are darker than

48
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.770
the last episode of Game of Thrones,

49
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.560
and sadder than a double feature

50
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.279
of Flight 93 and Requiem for a Dream.

51
00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:10.072
TRAVIS: Wow!

52
00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:11.940
SAM: His voice is so shrill it's like listening

53
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.710
to an ASMR video of someone sandblasting

54
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.751
a litter of puppies.

55
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.260
LIAM: Much more of a nasally drone, but go on.

56
00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:23.560
SAM: And Ashley, her character is,

57
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.510
I mean, does she even know?

58
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.510
She's missed so many games, it's more games

59
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.506
than Michael Vick and Tonya Harding combined.

60
00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:36.701
(groaning)

61
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:39.200
But hey, at least she missed them for a good reason.

62
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.620
Her "hit show" Blindspot is seen by literally

63
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.950
hundreds of people every week.

64
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.950
When does it air, by the way? Is it still

65
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.150
3:00am Wednesdays between infomercials

66
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.220
for eyebrow implants and a towel that absorbs solid waste?

67
00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:58.038
But I'm not here to roast Ashley.

68
00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:03.038
I mean, let's be honest, she is America's sweetheart.

69
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.180
How could anyone dislike someone who has

70
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.841
more OshKosh B'gosh overalls in her closet

71
00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:11.888
than Michael Jackson did?

72
00:03:11.888 --> 00:03:15.455
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

73
00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:17.740
TALIESIN: Wow! Wow!

74
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.940
SAM: Liam, on the other hand, is totally fair game.

75
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.620
His character choices are so emo,

76
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.220
Damien Rice called and said that they were too heavy.

77
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.590
His monologues are more emotionally depleting

78
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.190
than the discography of Dashboard Confessional.

79
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.360
Liam could have single-handedly funded

80
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.410
our Kickstarter if he didn't have so many traffic

81
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.770
tickets from searching himself on Tumblr

82
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.259
while driving.

83
00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.757
(groaning)

84
00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:46.223
LIAM: I only killed one kid.

85
00:03:46.223 --> 00:03:47.630
SAM: But as Dani Carr always advises me,

86
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.490
I don't need to go low in this election to win.

87
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.730
No, I'm going to win the way I won my Emmy,

88
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.440
by porking an executive of a trophy company.

89
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.590
And that is accurate.

90
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.560
Thank you, and god bless Sam-erica.

91
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.460
TALIESIN: Oh it hurts, oh it hurts.

92
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.390
MATT: So what about D&amp;D Beyond?

93
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.112
SAM: Oh yes, oh sorry.

94
00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:14.300
(laughter)

95
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.723
Also, D&amp;D Beyond wanted me to tell you--

96
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.310
this is an ad--

97
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.360
D&amp;D Beyond wanted me to tell you that they're going

98
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.590
to be hosting a great charity livestream

99
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.300
for Jasper's Game Day.

100
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.740
All proceeds are going to benefit

101
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.900
the American Association of Suicidology,

102
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.300
and you can tune in May 9th to

103
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.683
Twitch.TV/D&amp;DBeyond.

104
00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:40.730
There's going to be completely random

105
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.350
character gen and donation goals

106
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.710
to cause even more mayhem. Special guests

107
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.335
include DM Satine Phoenix, Patrick Rothfuss,

108
00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:51.480
et cetera!

109
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.146
Don't miss it May 9th. That's it.

110
00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:56.203
(cheering)

111
00:04:56.203 --> 00:04:58.036
TRAVIS: Et cetera's such a hit party.

112
00:04:58.036 --> 00:04:59.944
MARISHA: I love et cetera.

113
00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:01.730
MATT: And thank you D&amp;D Beyond.

114
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.060
Our second sponsor for the evening,

115
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.230
returning once more, our friends at Idle Champions.

116
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.630
If you guys aren't familiar with Idle Champions

117
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.240
of the Forgotten Realms, it is a strategy

118
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.610
video game where it brings together

119
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.220
a bunch iconic D&amp;D characters from the novels,

120
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.940
from the adventure books and modules,

121
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.530
from popular shows.

122
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.690
They actually added--the most recent champion

123
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.230
is Spurt from our campaign.

124
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.280
They added Spurt the Kobold as the most recent.

125
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.260
SAM: He was only alive for 20 minutes!

126
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.726
MATT: Yeah!

127
00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:31.884
And you can keep him alive for even longer, maybe!

128
00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:36.780
You can unlock him for the next 11 days

129
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.663
by playing the latest event called The Running.

130
00:05:40.663 --> 00:05:42.194
(laughter)

131
00:05:42.194 --> 00:05:43.476
TALIESIN: It's what he would've wanted.

132
00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.447
MATT: It's what he would've wanted.

133
00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:46.700
Each new champion adds complexity

134
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.160
and depths to the gameplay

135
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.396
as you quest through of hundreds of adventures

136
00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:52.860
based on existing D&amp;D books and adventures,

137
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.800
like Waterdeep Dragon Heist,

138
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.717
there's a whole adventure point there,

139
00:05:55.717 --> 00:05:57.350
Tomb of Annihilation, Curse of Strahd. All those classics

140
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.490
that have come out in the previous years,

141
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.540
all those things can be found

142
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.616
in element throughout the game.

143
00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:04.380
It's available for PC and Mac on Steam,

144
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.220
and on web as well as Xbox 1, PlayStation 4,

145
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.094
iPad and on all Android devices.

Thank you, guys.

149
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.870
All righty. Our good friends at 826LA,

150
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.320
who've been along with us for the entirety

151
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.190
pretty much of this journey we've had here,

152
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.930
they have one week left to go on their Kickstarter

153
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.350
campaign, perhaps you've a few of us tweet it out,

154
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.400
to create the Time Scouts handbook,

155
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.210
which is a time travel handbook created

156
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.570
to help you unlock your inner time hopper.

157
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.330
Make sure to check out and join their campaign

158
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.810
at TimeScouts.com/Kickstarter

159
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.330
Join us next Tuesday at 4:00pm Pacific

160
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.150
here for MAME Drop, featuring retro games

161
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.410
from our MAME Cabinet,

162
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.410
hosted by our classic Taliesin Jaffe.

163
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.284
SAM: Classic.

164
00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:56.231

MATT: Continuous.

167
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.223
TALIESIN: Crystal Taliesin,

168
00:07:01.223 --> 00:07:04.056
which was very popular in the 1980s.

169
00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:07.693
MARISHA: Was more a fan of new Taliesin.

170
00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:11.343
TALIESIN: Well, sucrose is weird. Yeah.

171
00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:16.155
MATT: Anyway. I believe that's the end of our announcements,

172
00:07:16.155 --> 00:07:18.116
so with that, let's go ahead and jump into

173
00:07:18.116 --> 00:07:21.033
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

MATT: And welcome back.

203
00:09:01.094 --> 00:09:04.087
(laughter)

204
00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:06.309
Last we left off:

205
00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:08.838
The Mighty Nein here in Xhorhas

206
00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:11.239
having allied themselves for the time being

207
00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:13.947
with the Bright Queen and the Kryn Dynasty.

208
00:09:13.947 --> 00:09:16.670
You took on a possible contract

209
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.111
under the Professor Waccoh,

210
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:22.300
a kooky half-orc professor

211
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.400
who works in the Marble Tomes Conservatory

212
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.160
within Rosohna, the capital city of the Dynasty,

213
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.510
to inspect the Steelworks

214
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.720
of the Deepriver Mine, which seem to have been

215
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.320
overtaken by some giants and had halted

216
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.768
production on a number of very important

217
00:09:36.768 --> 00:09:39.000
war machines that she had designed

218
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.270
that were to help with the war effort against the Empire.

219
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.050
Upon traveling there, you spoke with some of the figures,

220
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.890
you embarrassed the foreman at her request,

221
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.880
and then went on to meet these giants,

222
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.200
combat them briefly, make friends,

223
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.430
and then actually traveling with the Landspeaker--

224
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.300
who seems to be spiritual head of their troop--

225
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.343
head back to their home, the Braan,

226
00:10:02.343 --> 00:10:03.933
that existed within the mountains

227
00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:04.938
which seems to have been overtaken

228
00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.320
by some sort of strange demonic incursion.

229
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.520
Wandering through the halls, you began

230
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.370
to watch as some of the dead flesh

231
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.970
of her brethren that were left behind

232
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.800
began to be be borrowed by some of these demonic entities

233
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.451
and rising to fight you along with other

234
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:20.560
creatures that were tearing through familiar portals,

235
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.910
seemingly connected to distant Abyssal areas.

236
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.890
Upon traveling through, defeating these creatures,

237
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.333
a few of you nearly having your life siphoned a few times,

238
00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:33.330
managed to carve your way to the top,

239
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.230
seal the portals, discover the source

240
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.870
of these portals in a second device,

241
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.460
the second you've discovered.

242
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.000
That seems to be some sort of an Abyssal anchor

243
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.733
that creates or begins to loosen

244
00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:48.820
the veil between the realms the longer

245
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.510
it resides in those spaces.

246
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.760
You also burned a goblin.

247
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.580
(laughter)

248
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.413
You did.

249
00:10:55.413 --> 00:10:58.170
LIAM: Cleared the room.

250
00:10:59.053 --> 00:11:00.303
TRAVIS: Fuck your NPC!

251
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.510
MATT: After a hard-fought battle and freeing the Braan

252
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.510
of this terrible demonic presence,

253
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.220
the Landspeaker Soorna and the rest of you

254
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.970
took an evening's rest before journeying

255
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.030
back to complete this particular quest.

256
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.950
In that evening's rest, the storm had come in

257
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.378
that had been long been looming

258
00:11:23.378 --> 00:11:25.696
as the days of travel had guided you here,

259
00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:30.630
and in the rainy evening, Nott and Jester

260
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.490
waited out by the door as they watched

261
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.130
Yasha make her way into the storm,

262
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.630
in a series of attempts to connect

263
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.120
with the mysterious Stormlord

264
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.500
that seems to be occasionally wandering

265
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.860
into your dreams and speaking in riddles.

266
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.150
The entity that pulled you from a dark place long ago.

267
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.616
In your dreams that night,

268
00:11:48.616 --> 00:11:51.360
you seemed to make some connection,

269
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.360
and some imagery, some questions, some moments

270
00:11:56.643 --> 00:12:01.230
of reflection that you now get to unravel

271
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.880
as the morning comes to find you.

272
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.620
As you all slowly come to consciousnesses

273
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.780
in the morning, still raining outside,

274
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.200
the storm, while not as roaring as it was

275
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.370
the evening before, does seem to be

276
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.800
at least simmered down to a mild consistent rain.

277
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.770
Yasha, you're cold, freezing cold and soaked to the bone,

278
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.860
but you also grew up in these environments

279
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.830
and in some cases unable to locate

280
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.470
the warmest of fires and you're used to this

281
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.890
harsh lifestyle.

282
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.290
It doesn't bother you too much,

283
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.190
other than maybe you have a runny nose starting.

284
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.723
ASHLEY: (sniffs)

285
00:12:40.723 --> 00:12:42.620
MATT: The rest of you, coming to consciousness

286
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.470
within the Braan, shake your head awake,

287
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.306
most of you sore from the previous day's battle,

288
00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:52.268
gathering your supplies, and the morning is yours.

289
00:12:56.932 --> 00:12:58.606
MARISHA: You guys are soggy.

290
00:12:58.606 --> 00:12:59.514
SAM: We're soggy?

291
00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:01.540
TALIESIN: They went outside.

292
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.910
LAURA: Oh, no we're not. We're totally dry.

293
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.660
SAM: We went outside last night.

294
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.820
With Yasha.

295
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.853
MARISHA: Camping under the stars?

296
00:13:11.853 --> 00:13:15.900
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah. Just getting the lay of the land,

297
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.410
and seeing what was out there.

298
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.625
LAURA: Danced in the moonlight, and you know--

299
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.098
ASHLEY: Danced in the moonlight.

300
00:13:21.098 --> 00:13:23.547
LAURA: --screamed up at the sky 'cause it was fun and stuff.

301
00:13:23.547 --> 00:13:24.831
MARISHA: That's cool.

302
00:13:24.831 --> 00:13:25.817
ASHLEY: Yeah.

303
00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:27.160
MARISHA: Did you see the moonlight?

304
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.480
Felt like it was raining all night super cloudy.

305
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.230
ASHLEY: I saw a little bit of the moon,

306
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.230
but mostly just some thunder and just wanted to go outside

307
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.740
and see some things.

308
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.162
MARISHA: Hey Jester, can I talk to you for a second?

309
00:13:42.162 --> 00:13:42.995
LAURA: Yeah.

310
00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:44.405
MARISHA: Come here.

311
00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:45.270
Okay.

312
00:13:46.812 --> 00:13:47.753
LAURA: What is it?

313
00:13:47.753 --> 00:13:50.102
MARISHA: I was awake for like, half the night,

314
00:13:50.102 --> 00:13:52.037
just thinking about everything.

315
00:13:52.037 --> 00:13:53.470
LAURA: Wait. Oh, is this before

316
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.778
or after I gave you a massage?

317
00:13:54.778 --> 00:13:55.903
Were you up after that?

318
00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:57.427
MARISHA: Well, I fell asleep a little bit

319
00:13:57.427 --> 00:13:59.588
and then the thunder would wake me up a little bit,

320
00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:01.572
and then my brain kept going.

321
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.250
This fabric swatch?

322
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.180
LAURA: Mm-hmm, it's really pretty.

323
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.091
MARISHA: Right? I feel like I've read of a spell

324
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:13.930
that can help track down owners of items,

325
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.435
if you have things?

326
00:14:17.713 --> 00:14:18.796
LAURA: Oh.

327
00:14:20.223 --> 00:14:22.890
MARISHA: Skeining, skiing--uh--

328
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:25.662
LAURA: "Scrying" I think is what it's called.

329
00:14:25.662 --> 00:14:26.783
MARISHA: That's it!

330
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.616
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Traveler was

331
00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:29.850
telling me about it.

332
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.560
MARISHA: You know how to do that?

333
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.001
LAURA: Well, not exactly.

334
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:34.459
I would have to talk to him,

335
00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:37.303
you know, and then I would

336
00:14:37.303 --> 00:14:39.290
probably be able to figure it out.

337
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.004
MARISHA: I'll hold on to it until--

338
00:14:43.037 --> 00:14:45.047
you know, until we're ready.

339
00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:46.020
LAURA: Okay.

340
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.150
MARISHA: If that's okay?

341
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.040
LAURA: Sure. I'm just going to go talk to the Traveler

342
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.956
and see if I can figure it out, okay?

343
00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:51.998
Maybe he can give me some guidance.

344
00:14:51.998 --> 00:14:54.340
MARISHA: Do you want--you can take it.

345
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.340
LAURA: Okay, cool, thank you.

346
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.560
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:14:57.503 --> 00:14:59.593
LAURA: I just walk away rubbing it on my face.

348
00:14:59.593 --> 00:15:00.513
MATT: It's soft.

349
00:15:00.513 --> 00:15:02.777
LAURA: Then I sit down and take my spells,

350
00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:03.727
and choose Scrying.

351
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.628
Oh, Traveler, teach me how to scry.

352
00:15:08.628 --> 00:15:10.880
I really want to learn about this thingy.

353
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.478
MATT: (laughs)

354
00:15:13.478 --> 00:15:15.262
All right, so you pick your spells.

355
00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:17.438
Any one else need to prepare anything for the morning?

356
00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:20.980
TRAVIS: I feel so much better after that rest.

357
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.680
SAM: Oh yeah, you were rough yesterday.

358
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.881
TRAVIS: Yep. Half a man.

359
00:15:24.881 --> 00:15:26.570
SAM: Half a half a man.

360
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.559
TRAVIS: Half a--well yeah, that's true.

361
00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:30.360
LIAM: Are you able to make the trip back?

362
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.870
TRAVIS: Nah, I feel great.

363
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.877
Whatever it was abated in the night.

364
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.580
I'm ready to go.

365
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.779
SAM: Back up to full half power. That's great.

366
00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:45.446
TRAVIS: 100%. Full--yeah, half a--yeah.

367
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.510
SAM: That's great.

368
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.758
LIAM: Well, what's the plan?

369
00:15:49.758 --> 00:15:51.162
Do we want to get our animals?

370
00:15:51.162 --> 00:15:52.740
SAM: Yeah, we have to rustle up the animals

371
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.730
and go back to Waccoh right?

372
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.437
What do we get? What's our treasure, what's our prize?

373
00:15:57.437 --> 00:15:58.700
We did the thing right?

374
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.268
MARISHA: Well, we should probably escort

375
00:16:00.268 --> 00:16:01.910
Soorna back to the mines.

376
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.585
TALIESIN: Make sure that everything

377
00:16:03.585 --> 00:16:05.276
clears out appropriately.

378
00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:07.134
MARISHA: Make sure that they evacuate.

379
00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:10.030
TALIESIN: I'm sure just let the camp know

380
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.646
that we've taken care of it.

381
00:16:11.646 --> 00:16:14.140
TRAVIS: Didn't we have that shitbag's personal

382
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.510
what was it, letter? Picture?

383
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.569
MARISHA: Yeah, his little secret affair.

384
00:16:18.569 --> 00:16:19.653
LIAM: Moppet.

385
00:16:19.653 --> 00:16:22.970
SAM: Oh yeah, what was his name?

386
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.730
MARISHA: That was--

387
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:25.896
SAM: Darrell?

388
00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:29.486
TALIESIN: Looked like a Darrell.

389
00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:30.545
MARISHA: What the fuck was his name?

390
00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:31.520
TRAVIS: Durmand.

391
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.068
TALIESIN: Durmand. Also looked like a Durmand.

392
00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:33.950
MATT: Nope.

393
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.759
LIAM: Did you have the idea, Caduceus--

394
00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.308
TRAVIS: Does it start with D?

395
00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:38.341
MARISHA: Bodo.

396
00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:39.933
MATT: Foreman Bodo, correct.

397
00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:41.458
SAM: Bodo, Bodo.

398
00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:43.224
LIAM: --go back for the dead little one's skull?

399
00:16:43.224 --> 00:16:45.293
TALIESIN: I figured we'd do it by the end of the night,

400
00:16:45.293 --> 00:16:48.060
no sense starting the morning with bending

401
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.820
the laws of reality and nature.

402
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.130
Save that for the evening, just in case.

403
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.413
LAURA: Do you want me to do this

404
00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:58.070
before we leave or do you want me to do this later?

405
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:01.520
TRAVIS: How long does it take you?

406
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.790
LAURA: I don't know. Want me to try it?

407
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:06.623
SAM: Yeah.

408
00:17:07.503 --> 00:17:08.641
LAURA: I sit it down

409
00:17:08.641 --> 00:17:10.196
and I'm going to cast Scrying.

410
00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.679
MATT: Okay, you're going to cast Scrying.

411
00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:12.964
This is your first time scrying.

412
00:17:12.964 --> 00:17:13.798
LAURA: Yeah.

413
00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:15.649
MATT: It takes 10 minutes to prepare.

414
00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:17.922
Soorna at this point has come to consciousness

415
00:17:17.922 --> 00:17:20.180
and leans in as you're preparing the circle

416
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.513
and drawing out the space.

417
00:17:22.513 --> 00:17:25.082
Scoots in, and looks over towards you.

418
00:17:25.082 --> 00:17:27.990
"What is the blue one doing?"

419
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.950
TALIESIN: She's trying to ascertain

420
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.840
possibly the people who are--

421
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.650
the names and identities of the people possibly

422
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.640
responsible for this mess.

423
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.209
LAURA: Taking some pretty crystals

424
00:17:38.209 --> 00:17:41.601
I got from under ground, and putting it around it.

425
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:43.330
MATT: She reaches into a pouch

426
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.155
and pulls out these dried crushed leaves

427
00:17:45.155 --> 00:17:46.758
and sprinkles them over Jester,

428
00:17:46.758 --> 00:17:50.383
and goes, "To bring good luck."

429
00:17:50.383 --> 00:17:52.583
Which you hear as, (low-voiced Giant).

430
00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.108
TALIESIN: What she said.

431
00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.363
LAURA: What did she say?

432
00:17:56.363 --> 00:17:59.016
TALIESIN: Oh, she said, "For good luck."

433
00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:00.524
LAURA: Oh!

434
00:18:00.524 --> 00:18:02.601
Thank you. How do I say thank you?

435
00:18:02.601 --> 00:18:03.540
TALIESIN: Thank you.

436
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.123
Oh, oh. "Cluk (click)."

437
00:18:05.123 --> 00:18:07.251
(laughter)

438
00:18:07.251 --> 00:18:09.680
LAURA: "Cluk (click)."

439
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.423
MATT: "Cluk (click)."

440
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:14.614
(laughter)

441
00:18:14.614 --> 00:18:17.161
TALIESIN: Oh, don't try that again.

442
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:19.654
MATT: All right, so you're concentrating

443
00:18:19.654 --> 00:18:21.587
on the material.

444
00:18:21.587 --> 00:18:22.570
LAURA: Yeah.

445
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.786
MATT: You don't know who this belonged to.

446
00:18:25.786 --> 00:18:26.619
LAURA: Mm-mm.

447
00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:28.825
MATT: So whoever it is, they get a pretty--

448
00:18:28.825 --> 00:18:31.000
LAURA: But I got a possession or a garment.

449
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.150
MATT: You do, they get a bonus to their saving throw

450
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.489
and they get a penalty to their saving throw.

451
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:36.489
LAURA: Okay.

452
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.632
MATT: Yeah, nah, that's a fail.

453
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.822
Yeah. I rolled a six.

454
00:18:49.972 --> 00:18:50.830
So.

455
00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:54.890
(Wayne's World flashback noises)

456
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.631
LAURA: I'm going to use my scrunchy like it's the fabric.

457
00:18:57.889 --> 00:18:58.722
LIAM: Good prop work.

458
00:18:58.722 --> 00:18:59.580
LAURA: Thank you.

459
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.248
MATT: As you set the piece of blue fabric down

460
00:19:02.248 --> 00:19:04.871
in the center of the circle, and then both

461
00:19:04.871 --> 00:19:07.210
your hands grasp the symbol of the Traveler,

462
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.153
your eyes closed.

463
00:19:09.153 --> 00:19:10.686
You feel a warm sensation

464
00:19:10.686 --> 00:19:12.550
on the outside of your knuckles,

465
00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.680
where you feel like two additional hands

466
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.338
reach around and clasp your grip.

467
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.390
Then in a bit of your left ear

468
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.320
you hear the familiar voice of the Traveler say,

469
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.130
"Well, let's take a trip shall we?"

470
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.196
LAURA: Okay!

471
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.930
MATT: As you open your eyes, you're no longer

472
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.513
within the Braan.

473
00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:36.054
In fact, you don't know where you are.

474
00:19:36.054 --> 00:19:39.760
All you see is mist and cloud rushing past,

475
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.760
sourceless, movement at a speed you've never traveled with,

476
00:19:44.773 --> 00:19:49.749
whatever the space or location you might be is in the sky,

477
00:19:49.749 --> 00:19:51.390
in another plane, you have no sense

478
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.413
of up or down, left and right, just movement.

479
00:19:54.413 --> 00:19:56.010
LAURA: Is this how it's supposed to feel?

480
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.998
MATT: "Shh."

481
00:19:56.998 --> 00:19:57.906
LAURA: Okay.

482
00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.098
MATT: "Trust me."

483
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.075
Then the mists part.

484
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.660
Your eyes clear, revealing a dark lit den,

485
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.500
with a carpeted chamber decorated with fine furniture.

486
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.530
Standing by a cabinet that remains open to one side,

487
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.930
a figure wearing a long blue set of fine wool robes

488
00:20:19.249 --> 00:20:22.552
stares down at an object it is holding.

489
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.140
Masculine frame, you see golden blond hair,

490
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.000
and a soft curl combed back to the shoulder

491
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.950
behind the ears.

492
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.590
A stoic expression sits on his clean shaven face

493
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.932
as he speaks into a stone in his hand.

494
00:20:38.921 --> 00:20:41.857
(with Zemnian accent) "You have naught to worry about that.

495
00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:44.108
"She is paranoid enough in the widest sense,

496
00:20:44.108 --> 00:20:45.488
"but I know her blind spots.

497
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.050
"Yes, I have the emblem. Waiting for a window,

498
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.275
"but let's plot for next Grissen, shall we?"

499
00:20:54.275 --> 00:20:55.610
LAURA: Next Grissen?

500
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.801
"Six days. Ah, the week after that."

501
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:03.543
LAURA: (repeating in whispers)

502
00:21:03.543 --> 00:21:06.085
"That'll put 13 days.

503
00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:09.963
"At the Overcrow? Hm."

504
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.853
The figure stops and looks back and forth

505
00:21:13.853 --> 00:21:16.675
over the room. "Enough, I've dallied too long.

506
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.970
"Angel's eye, friend," and takes the stone

507
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:23.761
and places it in the cabinet, closes it.

508
00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:26.290
SAM: (whispers) So many terms.

509
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.090
The figure then looks about, checks the curtains.

510
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.010
Goes and checks the door, makes sure it's locked.

511
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.363
Sits down at the desk and pulls out

512
00:21:35.363 --> 00:21:37.471
a book from underneath.

513
00:21:37.471 --> 00:21:38.637
Opens it and begins

514
00:21:38.637 --> 00:21:40.930
taking notes and reading through.

515
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.930
Make a perception check.

516
00:21:45.903 --> 00:21:48.427
LAURA: That could've been so bad. 18.

517
00:21:48.427 --> 00:21:51.188
MATT: In the brief moment that the book is open--

518
00:21:51.188 --> 00:21:52.371
The text is too small

519
00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:54.440
on the inside for you to make out any of the contents,

520
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.980
but all you catch is the title of the book,

521
00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.590
it reads: <i>The King That Crawls</i>.

522
00:22:00.575 --> 00:22:02.730
LAURA: <i>The King That Crawls</i>.

523
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.730
MATT: For the remainder of your time,

524
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.440
of this scry, it's just this figure,

525
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.886
quietly going from page to page making notes

526
00:22:10.886 --> 00:22:12.119
and occasionally stopping and listening.

527
00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:14.460
LAURA: Are his ears pointy or humany?

528
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.840
MATT: They appear to be human.

529
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.673
LAURA: Okay.

530
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.993
MATT: 10 minutes continue.

531
00:22:20.993 --> 00:22:22.410
LAURA: Does he pick his nose at all,

532
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.670
is he composed, is he just writing?

533
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.690
MATT: He seems relatively composed,

534
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.070
does scratch and flick something out of his ear

535
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.940
at one point.

536
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.773
LAURA: Gross.

537
00:22:30.773 --> 00:22:32.093
MATT: That's the most amusing

538
00:22:32.093 --> 00:22:33.940
hygiene based gag you manage to uncover

539
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.070
during this--the important parts of a scry.

540
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.330
LAURA: Is the book old? Does the book look old?

541
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.240
MATT: The book appears to be pretty old.

542
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.970
It's not falling apart by any means

543
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.440
but you can see just from the pages

544
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.510
that appear to be stained and weathered,

545
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.660
the outer leather binding itself

546
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.170
appears to be frayed and rubbed at edges.

547
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.450
It's not a new tome by any means.

548
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.790
LAURA: Do I hear anything

549
00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.300
coming from outside of the room?

550
00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.890
Does it sound like outside noises,

551
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.213
like a city or blacksmith or anything I can hear?

552
00:23:04.264 --> 00:23:06.320
MATT: From this position you don't hear anything.

553
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.157
I'd say roll a perception check, why not.

554
00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:11.907
Why not, just in case.

555
00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:17.860
LAURA: 23.

556
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.140
MATT: 23. I'd say with the last few moments

557
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.640
of the scrying spell trying desperately

558
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.000
to focus, the ward that you've placed here

559
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.080
is very limited in what it can maintain.

560
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.410
All you do manage to catch

561
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.393
is the hint of a horse whinny.

562
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.390
Muffled from the exterior of this chamber.

563
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.700
Which does cause him to pause for a second,

564
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.130
get up and check the window,

565
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.990
then sit back down and go back into scrawling his notes.

566
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.280
LAURA: He's kind of skittish.

567
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.890
Did you say he was clean shaven?

568
00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.190
MATT: Clean shaven, yes.

569
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.230
Then your vision is pulled back,

570
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.920
the clouds continue.

571
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.967
You come back into your body.

572
00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:05.850
You're present once more, eyes still closed now,

573
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.320
you can smell the cold moist air from the rainfall

574
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.390
here in this stone fortress up on the Penumbra range.

575
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.910
The warmth from the grasp of the Traveler's

576
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.770
hands on yours begins to fade and you open your eyes

577
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.480
just in time to see the spectral

578
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.100
hands on yours pull back and then fade away.

579
00:24:27.414 --> 00:24:28.247
MARISHA: That was crazy.

580
00:24:28.247 --> 00:24:29.388
LAURA: Did you see him? Did you see him?

581
00:24:29.388 --> 00:24:30.447
Did you see him? Did you see him?

582
00:24:30.447 --> 00:24:32.372
MARISHA: No but your eyes went all like white.

583
00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:35.507
LIAM: Rapid eyeball movements.

584
00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:36.630
LAURA: Did you hear me talking 'cause I was talking.

585
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.510
MARISHA: You were kind of mumbling.

586
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.820
You're drooling a little.

587
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.730
LIAM: You snort-laughed a little bit as well.

588
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.139
TALIESIN: A lot of words.
LAURA: I thought I got it.

589
00:24:45.139 --> 00:24:45.972
TRAVIS: Other side.

590
00:24:45.972 --> 00:24:48.690
LAURA: Okay so--this is going to be hard to remember,

591
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.343
there's a dude and he had blond hair

592
00:24:50.343 --> 00:24:52.250
and it was curly and he looked like, you know--

593
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.600
but he was wearing the blue robes,

594
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.740
and he looked really fancy, and like he's rich

595
00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.180
and stuff, and he was at the cabinet

596
00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.570
and he was looking in this little ball

597
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.850
and he was talking to somebody

598
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.320
through this little ball.

599
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.340
I know, and he said "No, she's paranoid enough

600
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.352
already" or something and then something about

601
00:25:08.352 --> 00:25:11.880
"Gris" and six days and then 13 days,

602
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.150
and then he said "Angel's eye."

603
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.424
And then he said--

604
00:25:15.424 --> 00:25:16.257
SAM: Emblem.

605
00:25:16.257 --> 00:25:17.770
LAURA: Something about an emblem,

606
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.640
"we have the emblem" and then he went and sat

607
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.420
down at this book that said the <i>King That Crawls</i>,

608
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.100
and then he's--did I get that right?

609
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.933
SAM: Mm hm.

610
00:25:28.933 --> 00:25:31.366
LAURA: Then he was writing shit down

611
00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:33.020
for a while and then he dug something out of his ear

612
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.220
like earwax and he flicked it away. So awesome.

613
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.210
Then this horse whinnied and he went over

614
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.030
and was like, "Oh I don't know what's going on"

615
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.980
and he went back and he started writing again

616
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.470
and then I was gone.

617
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:46.750
TRAVIS: That's a lot.

618
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.811
LAURA: I think that's everything.

619
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:48.769
ASHLEY: That was a lot.

620
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:49.602
TRAVIS: Very impressive.

621
00:25:49.602 --> 00:25:50.436
MARISHA: That's incredible.

622
00:25:50.436 --> 00:25:52.176
SAM: What is the King that Crawls what is that?

623
00:25:52.176 --> 00:25:53.800
LAURA: Didn't somebody else talk

624
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.633
about something that crawls?

625
00:25:54.633 --> 00:25:55.570
MARISHA: Yeah, that sounds familiar.

626
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.900
MATT: If anybody would like to make a religion check.

627
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.706
LAURA: All of us? Anybody?

628
00:26:00.706 --> 00:26:02.722
MARISHA: I'm trained.

629
00:26:02.722 --> 00:26:04.300
ASHLEY: I'm just going to do it, just 'cause.

630
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.133
TALIESIN: 12?

631
00:26:05.133 --> 00:26:06.222
LAURA: Five?

632
00:26:06.222 --> 00:26:07.055
LIAM: 23.

633
00:26:07.055 --> 00:26:07.888
LAURA: Yeah.

634
00:26:07.888 --> 00:26:08.721
TRAVIS: 16?

635
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:09.794
MARISHA: 10.

636
00:26:09.794 --> 00:26:11.547
MATT: Okay I'll say the 16 and the 23 are both

637
00:26:11.547 --> 00:26:14.290
enough to go through on this one.

638
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.260
"The King That Crawls"; it's reminiscent of a secondary

639
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.720
title of one of the betrayer gods

640
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.070
known as the Crawling King,

641
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.922
Named primarily as Torog.

642
00:26:22.922 --> 00:26:23.825
TRAVIS: Torog?

643
00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:25.150
MATT: Torog.

644
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.900
Torog is the dark god of endless tunnels

645
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.560
and caverns beneath Exandria.

646
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.160
He's considered the patron of torturers and jailers,

647
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.752
and those that wish to rob others of freedom.

648
00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:39.819
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

649
00:26:39.819 --> 00:26:42.294
LAURA: I feel like we've heard of him before.

650
00:26:42.294 --> 00:26:43.660
MARISHA: Yeah me too.
LIAM: We have.

651
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.580
MATT: In passing.

652
00:26:48.484 --> 00:26:50.830
The Crawling King, the King that Crawls,

653
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.020
it seems pretty similar.

654
00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.490
TRAVIS: I've heard similar tale about one of the ancient

655
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.720
deities, right, but on the bad side,

656
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.610
like a dark individual.

657
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.500
Always represented with like endless tunnels.

658
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.400
LIAM: Massive hungering worm?

659
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.250
MATT: Actually the imagery as it's described--

660
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:18.450
and there aren't a lot of sketched representations.

661
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.120
In some cases it's considered a taboo to put into books,

662
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.450
a full representation, but they speak

663
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.967
of supposedly in the physical form

664
00:27:26.967 --> 00:27:28.470
of this betrayer god during the Calamity,

665
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.950
resembled a large bulbous worm-like creature

666
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.300
with a human face and multiple arms

667
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.020
just screaming as it tore through under the earth.

668
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.190
SAM: Was it one of the three, the worm?

669
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.720
MARISHA: I mean, yeah we've already encountered worm.

670
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.271
SAM: No but one of the three things on the--

671
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:46.800
LIAM: Titans, yeah.

672
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.190
LAURA: Oh my gosh, what if he's like best friends

673
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.070
with your deity thingy?

674
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.763
TALIESIN: Or in conflict with him.

675
00:27:52.763 --> 00:27:54.184
LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

676
00:27:54.184 --> 00:27:55.384
TRAVIS: He could be like a business partner,

677
00:27:55.384 --> 00:27:59.466
right? Just could be a casual acquaintance on the dark side.

678
00:27:59.466 --> 00:28:00.310
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

679
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:03.335
SAM: What were the three iconography?

680
00:28:03.335 --> 00:28:05.680
TRAVIS: Flying purple phoenix.

681
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.840
LIAM: His serpent, and a worm,

682
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.285
I don't know if it's the same one.

683
00:28:11.285 --> 00:28:12.312
LAURA: Probably is.

684
00:28:12.312 --> 00:28:13.830
MATT: You would say, from the imagery

685
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.030
that was carved in the cave,

686
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.201
it seemed to have a toothy mouth

687
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:22.040
that occurs at the front, scaled folds,

688
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.190
and then a tongue that curled out

689
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.800
that had three eyes at the tip.

690
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.830
LIAM: Right, which is different than a human-like face.

691
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.207
MATT: It's fairly different from the descriptor

692
00:28:31.207 --> 00:28:33.440
of Torog in the classic books.

693
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.465
SAM: Then we're fine.

694
00:28:36.572 --> 00:28:38.001
MATT: There's some similarities

695
00:28:38.001 --> 00:28:40.026
being large worm-like creatures, of course.

696
00:28:40.026 --> 00:28:40.940
TRAVIS: He's not fun. He's associated

697
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.390
with torture and misery, you know.

698
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.000
LAURA: Also, the guy said something about

699
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.980
the Overcrow or something.

700
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.960
TRAVIS: The Overcrow?
LIAM: What about it?

701
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.100
LAURA: I don't know. I just remember

702
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.062
he said the location was the Overcrow.

703
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.791
SAM: The Overcrow.

704
00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:02.926
TRAVIS: Any of us ever heard of a tavern or--

705
00:29:02.926 --> 00:29:06.850
LIAM: Cuckoo in 13 days. Meet at the Overcrow.

706
00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.942
MATT: You haven't.

707
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:13.180
SAM: That word she said, Christa, Grista,

708
00:29:14.038 --> 00:29:16.120
MATT: Grissen is a day of the week, yes.

709
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.292
Next Grissen.

710
00:29:17.292 --> 00:29:18.192
LAURA: Next Grissen.

711
00:29:18.192 --> 00:29:19.650
SAM: And that's six days from now.

712
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.050
MATT: It was six, but then turned to 13 the week after.

713
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.930
LIAM: 13 days later at the Overcrow on Grissen.

714
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.805
SAM: 13 days.

715
00:29:28.805 --> 00:29:30.970
TRAVIS: You said "angel's eye?"

716
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.111
LAURA: Something like angel's eye.

717
00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:33.502
It was a greeting or something.

718
00:29:33.502 --> 00:29:34.335
LIAM: That was like a little greeting or a saying.

719
00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:35.230
Under his eye.

720
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.673
TRAVIS: Okay.

721
00:29:36.673 --> 00:29:39.150
Now, did he see you in this?

722
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.910
LAURA: No, he didn't ever look towards me.

723
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.643
So I would think he didn't--

724
00:29:42.643 --> 00:29:44.215
I mean, I wasn't like there-there.

725
00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:46.236
TRAVIS: He was wearing the same colored robes?

726
00:29:46.236 --> 00:29:47.438
LAURA: You guys didn't see the Traveler

727
00:29:47.438 --> 00:29:49.530
and he was there with me, so then the guy

728
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:50.750
probably didn't see me.

729
00:29:52.478 --> 00:29:54.750
SAM: You just talked to the Traveler just now?

730
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.583
LAURA: Well, yeah.

731
00:29:55.583 --> 00:29:56.480
SAM: All the time?

732
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.193
LAURA: Well, yeah.

733
00:29:58.193 --> 00:29:59.430
SAM: That's very impressive.

734
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.820
LAURA: Yeah, well, he likes me a lot.

735
00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.240
SAM: I'd like to meet him someday.

736
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.504
LAURA: I would like you to meet him someday.

737
00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:10.198
LIAM: Does he ever talk about others like you?

738
00:30:10.198 --> 00:30:12.550
LAURA: Well, he says that, you know, that we're going

739
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.640
to have a gathering sometime.

740
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.235
Hey, you guys want to be his disciples?

741
00:30:20.132 --> 00:30:24.950
TRAVIS: Ooh, uh, mm, I don't know, no.

742
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.530
LAURA: Because here's the thing,

743
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.870
we're all going to go, you know, all of the people

744
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.330
that worship him and do the things for him.

745
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:35.230
We're all going to go and I bet if I came with all of you

746
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.470
and you all, like, I had converted you

747
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.530
then I would be like the coolest one there.

748
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:40.630
SAM: VIP everything.

749
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.190
LAURA: Like, totally. I don't think anybody

750
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.290
else would be as cool as me.

751
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.170
LIAM: Could it work in tiers, though, so that we

752
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.340
are your disciples and you are his disciple?

753
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.392
TRAVIS: Like a pyramid scheme?

754
00:30:49.392 --> 00:30:50.410
LIAM: So we are followers--

755
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.523
LAURA: Of me?

756
00:30:51.523 --> 00:30:53.700
TRAVIS: Is there bottle service at this get together?

757
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.666
LAURA: Maybe.

758
00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:56.941
MARISHA: Can you ascribe to more than one god?

759
00:30:56.941 --> 00:30:58.449
Does anyone know that? Can you be like,

760
00:30:58.449 --> 00:31:00.482
"Yeah, I like both gods?"

761
00:31:00.482 --> 00:31:01.315
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

762
00:31:01.315 --> 00:31:03.156
MARISHA: Because I already have the Knowing Mistress.

763
00:31:03.156 --> 00:31:05.270
LIAM: It might be a little jealous of each other,

764
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.370
depends on the gods.

765
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.770
LAURA: I don't know. I mean, the Traveler's

766
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:09.150
pretty friendly with everyone.

767
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.949
LIAM: We do have faith in you, so you have faith in him.

768
00:31:12.949 --> 00:31:14.924
LAURA: Yeah, you're a follower of the Traveler, too.

769
00:31:14.924 --> 00:31:16.474
MARISHA: 11.

770
00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:20.287
MATT: As best as you can make out,

771
00:31:20.287 --> 00:31:22.580
there are people that believe or at least

772
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.440
sometimes pray to different gods based on

773
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.703
what they need. Some farmers will pray

774
00:31:26.703 --> 00:31:29.545
to Avandra for a good journey,

775
00:31:29.545 --> 00:31:32.280
some people will pray to the Wildmother for a good crop,

776
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.480
some people will pray to the Stormlord or the Wildmother

777
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.525
again if they're making a journey across the ocean,

778
00:31:39.525 --> 00:31:43.780
but to truly become a proper disciple

779
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.710
and acolyte, that type of worship

780
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:52.400
tends to be pretty singular or jealousy can factor in.

781
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.470
That's as much you can ascertain about that nature.

782
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.000
LIAM: I would think it's in all of our interests

783
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.090
to know more about him because he helps you help us

784
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.220
and that is a good thing.

785
00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.830
LAURA: Right, he helps us a lot.

786
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.743
TRAVIS: Jester, you've been talking to him

787
00:32:04.743 --> 00:32:06.250
for as long as you can remember, right?

788
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.780
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, we hung out when I was little

789
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.180
he started.

790
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.630
I mean, remember before he came.

791
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.232
It was really lame.

792
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.535
Then he started showing up more

793
00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:20.250
and it was cooler. You know?

794
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.271
ASHLEY: Did you actually see him?

795
00:32:23.271 --> 00:32:24.565
LAURA: Yeah!

796
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.890
ASHLEY: What does he look like?

797
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.731
LAURA: Well, before, he was

798
00:32:31.731 --> 00:32:34.470
a little kid, you know?

799
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.880
SAM: When you were a little kid?

800
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.050
LAURA: Right. So he's my age.

801
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.580
ASHLEY: So he took the place of like a little kid

802
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.091
when you were little to be your friend?

803
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:45.390
LAURA: Well, I mean, he would just show

804
00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.250
up in my room, you know. He's a few years older than me,

805
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.010
but he was still a kid, too.

806
00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.030
MARISHA: But he's like a god though,

807
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.980
he's a god, right?

808
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.813
LAURA: Yeah.

809
00:32:54.813 --> 00:32:58.160
MARISHA: He probably just took that form

810
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.270
to be able to relate to you, maybe?

811
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.590
LIAM: Well, he's a god, but you've not met anyone

812
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.560
else who follows him yet.

813
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.770
LAURA: No, I have, I have.

814
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:07.730
Remember we met that gnoll guy?

815
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.940
LIAM: Ah yeah, one.

816
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.260
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

817
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.762
TRAVIS: Has he ever ask you to do anything

818
00:33:12.762 --> 00:33:15.553
bad, like hurt anybody?

819
00:33:15.553 --> 00:33:17.810
LAURA: Oh, like violent or something?

820
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.195
No, no, no.

821
00:33:20.195 --> 00:33:22.367
No, he mostly just is like, "Hey, go tie

822
00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:25.660
"that guy's shoes together and watch him trip."

823
00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.890
I did that a couple times, it was real good.

824
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.660
MARISHA: Does your god ask you--

825
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.036
LIAM: Is your friend a god?

826
00:33:31.036 --> 00:33:33.258
MARISHA: --to do bad things and hurt people?

827
00:33:33.258 --> 00:33:34.571
Is that why you're asking?

828
00:33:34.571 --> 00:33:39.050
TRAVIS: No, no. Take it easy; I'm just asking.

829
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.320
SAM: What about Yasha? Does your god

830
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.928
ask you to do anything bad or weird?

831
00:33:44.928 --> 00:33:46.056
ASHLEY: Not yet.

832
00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:48.614
LAURA: I remember on the ship, your god

833
00:33:48.614 --> 00:33:50.340
turned into some sort of lightning beast

834
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.277
and then you had to violently fight him.

835
00:33:52.277 --> 00:33:53.280
ASHLEY: I had to fight it,

836
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.800
but I don't know if that was him

837
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.934
or he sent something to fight.

838
00:33:57.934 --> 00:34:01.407
LAURA: So he's pretty--That seemed aggressive.

839
00:34:01.407 --> 00:34:04.491
ASHLEY: I have a feeling he might be pretty aggressive,

840
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:09.230
but I still have so much to learn.

841
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.230
LIAM: This world is chockablock with beings

842
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.440
far more powerful than any of us are.

843
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.970
TRAVIS: Have you talked to yours since

844
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:18.050
you were a kid, too?

845
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.860
ASHLEY: No, I only started,

846
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:25.350
I only started to really follow and know about him

847
00:34:26.684 --> 00:34:29.919
not that long ago.

848
00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:31.630
As a kid, you know, we didn't really have anything

849
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.638
like that in my tribe

850
00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:37.580
other than the matriarch of our tribe.

851
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.240
TRAVIS: Was there a particular reason

852
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.362
y'all started communicating?

853
00:34:43.362 --> 00:34:46.385
ASHLEY: Yeah, he found me.

854
00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.670
I guess I found him.

855
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.062
SAM: Were you lost? Were you wandering?

856
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:58.682
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, I was lost,

857
00:35:01.535 --> 00:35:02.883
I was lost.

858
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:07.660
LIAM: You were with people first, then you weren't?

859
00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.165
ASHLEY: Yeah.

860
00:35:09.165 --> 00:35:11.572
LIAM: Why did you leave?

861
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:20.243
ASHLEY: I left my tribe because...

862
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.530
LIAM: If it's a sore subject, we do not have to push it.

863
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.817
ASHLEY: No, it's--

864
00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:36.477
Some of them know and we've discussed, but I was--

865
00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.790
I was married at one point,

866
00:35:45.163 --> 00:35:48.298
and in our tribe, we are chosen a mate

867
00:35:48.298 --> 00:35:51.900
by the Sky Spear and I married.

868
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.593
LIAM: Sky Spear?

869
00:35:53.593 --> 00:35:57.154
ASHLEY: Yeah. She is the head of our tribe.

870
00:36:01.248 --> 00:36:04.463
Yeah, who I married was not

871
00:36:04.463 --> 00:36:09.421
who I was supposed to be with.

872
00:36:11.697 --> 00:36:13.380
And...

873
00:36:15.229 --> 00:36:18.052
we got in trouble and...

874
00:36:23.736 --> 00:36:25.127
Well...

875
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.235
if you disobey,

876
00:36:30.085 --> 00:36:32.435
your punishment is death.

877
00:36:33.687 --> 00:36:36.478
So I ran away.

878
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.020
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

879
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:46.020
SAM: And that's when your god, the Stormlord, found you?

880
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.990
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's some time that I'm missing.

881
00:36:53.224 --> 00:36:54.932
LIAM: You left your wife?

882
00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.670
ASHLEY: I did.

883
00:37:01.611 --> 00:37:05.419
They had captured her, and I--

884
00:37:06.619 --> 00:37:08.910
-I ran away.

885
00:37:09.903 --> 00:37:10.847
MARISHA: Oh.

886
00:37:10.847 --> 00:37:12.260
SAM: You're missing time, though, you said?

887
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.950
A gap in your memory?

888
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:16.630
ASHLEY: I am missing a gap in my memory.

889
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.263
SAM: How long?

890
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.618
ASHLEY: I don't exactly know, but

891
00:37:30.485 --> 00:37:31.751
weeks, months?
SAM: You have a gap

892
00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:33.130
in your memory, don't you?

893
00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.690
LAURA: Molly had one, too.

894
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.910
MARISHA: Don't you, too?

895
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.000
TRAVIS: I do as well.

896
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.217
MARISHA: Well, I remember everything.

897
00:37:39.217 --> 00:37:40.250
LAURA: I do, too.

898
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:41.416
TALIESIN: I don't really remember anything,

899
00:37:41.416 --> 00:37:43.478
but that's normal.

900
00:37:43.478 --> 00:37:45.929
(laughter)

901
00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:47.470
LAURA: Do you ever think, Yasha, about going

902
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.970
back and seeing what Zuala's doing?

903
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.028
If she's okay?

904
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.283
TALIESIN: Mm.

905
00:37:54.283 --> 00:37:56.166
ASHLEY: Um.

906
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.510
I don't think she's alive anymore,

907
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.952
because when I left...

908
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.690
they were executing her.

909
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.565
SAM: Did you see her die?

910
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:26.503
ASHLEY: No, but I know it was happening.

911
00:38:28.826 --> 00:38:29.926
And...

912
00:38:33.726 --> 00:38:38.726
I just ran because I was scared and I am a coward.

913
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.747
MARISHA: No, you're a survivor.

914
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.198
ASHLEY: That's one way to put it.

915
00:38:48.512 --> 00:38:50.510
LIAM: I am sorry for your loss.

916
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.387
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's terrible.

917
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:59.460
ASHLEY: Well, yeah. There you have it.

918
00:39:01.737 --> 00:39:03.403
But...

919
00:39:06.157 --> 00:39:08.765
Sometimes I think about going back and

920
00:39:10.508 --> 00:39:12.550
turning myself in, I guess,

921
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.780
but I guess there's also a part of me that is upset

922
00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.680
that I wasn't able to be with the person

923
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.622
that I wanted to be with.

924
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.063
TRAVIS: What about revenge?

925
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:29.260
ASHLEY: Well, I think about that every day.

926
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.473
LAURA: We could go with you. We could kill them all.

927
00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.777
ASHLEY: That sounds like a lot of fun.

928
00:39:43.266 --> 00:39:46.145
But that's not--I don't know.

929
00:39:46.145 --> 00:39:47.495
TRAVIS: What was that? What?

930
00:39:47.495 --> 00:39:49.738
ASHLEY: I don't know. I don't know,

931
00:39:49.738 --> 00:39:50.630
I think--

932
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:57.866
I don't know.

933
00:39:57.866 --> 00:39:59.370
SAM: Do you think your murderous revenge

934
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.410
could wait 13 days?

935
00:40:04.136 --> 00:40:05.658
ASHLEY: Yes.

936
00:40:05.658 --> 00:40:07.840
SAM: Because maybe we could follow this clue,

937
00:40:09.248 --> 00:40:13.205
and find out where the Overcrow is,

938
00:40:13.205 --> 00:40:17.970
and meet up and rendezvous with this person in blue.

939
00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.440
LAURA: Yeah.

940
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.223
SAM: And figure out what the fuck is going on.

941
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.333
LAURA: Yeah.

942
00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:27.223
TRAVIS: Have to figure out where the Overcrow is.

943
00:40:27.223 --> 00:40:29.131
SAM: I mean, can't be too many Overcrows, right?

944
00:40:29.131 --> 00:40:31.095
LIAM: Well, we will start by going back

945
00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:34.280
to collect on our bounty and ask around the city

946
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.370
and hopefully we will have curried

947
00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.010
favor after this somewhat.

948
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.598
SAM: Maybe you have a Yellow Parchments or something

949
00:40:40.598 --> 00:40:42.599
that we can just sort of flip through.

950
00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:44.070
TRAVIS: Yellow Parchments?

951
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.249
SAM: Yeah, you know.

952
00:40:45.249 --> 00:40:46.982
TRAVIS: I think only the bigger cities have those.

953
00:40:46.982 --> 00:40:48.318
SAM: Maybe you're right.

954
00:40:48.318 --> 00:40:49.976
MARISHA: They're starting to expand into rural areas.

955
00:40:49.976 --> 00:40:51.111
TRAVIS: People just throw them out, though.

956
00:40:51.111 --> 00:40:53.377
I don't even really understand the value of the work that

957
00:40:53.377 --> 00:40:54.219
goes into them.

958
00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:56.746
TALIESIN: I downloaded the cantrip. It's pretty easy.

959
00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:59.329
(laughter)

960
00:41:02.539 --> 00:41:03.670
LAURA: I wonder if I could scry

961
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.910
on that place or something and figure out where it is.

962
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.760
MARISHA: It's so cool that you can do that.

963
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.660
LAURA: I mean, I want to do it all the time.

964
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.260
MARISHA: It's pretty rad.

965
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.190
TRAVIS: You zoom in and you see the person

966
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.480
where they are and what they're doing?

967
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.680
SAM: You need a thing? You need an item?

968
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.220
LAURA: Or apparently if I know the person

969
00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.750
or if I know a lot of details,

970
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.960
I don't necessarily need something of theirs.

971
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.020
SAM: You can just creepily watch them?

972
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.251
LAURA: I could watch any of you any time.

973
00:41:31.251 --> 00:41:33.390
SAM: (gasps) You could be watching Caleb at night?

974
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.210
LIAM: The more you know about a person,

975
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.390
the easier it is. I have tried to study this,

976
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.670
but I have not yet cracked it.

977
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:40.890
LAURA: I know a lot about you, Caleb,

978
00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.380
so I could scry on you.

979
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.859
LIAM: Well, you know that I smell.

980
00:41:44.859 --> 00:41:46.222
You know that...

981
00:41:46.222 --> 00:41:49.670
LAURA: Oh! And the guy, he sounded like you, Caleb.

982
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:51.680
He kind of had a Zemnian accent.

983
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.550
LIAM: All right.

984
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.838
LAURA: At least I think he did.

985
00:41:56.838 --> 00:41:58.662
SAM: Do you know any--what did he look like?

986
00:41:58.662 --> 00:42:00.793
Blond, you said? Do you know any blonds?

987
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.163
LIAM: Some.

988
00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:08.360
LAURA: He was human and he had really beautiful

989
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.270
blond hair that came to about his shoulders

990
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.720
and then it had a little bit of a curl to it,

991
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.030
and it was like combed back, like he obviously

992
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.780
cared about the way he looked. He was very clean shaven.

993
00:42:18.649 --> 00:42:19.782
LIAM: The only thing that I could think

994
00:42:19.782 --> 00:42:21.098
that would be would be one of the paintings

995
00:42:21.098 --> 00:42:21.931
at the Academy.

996
00:42:23.673 --> 00:42:24.695
MATT: Maybe, but even--

997
00:42:24.695 --> 00:42:25.685
LAURA: Oh! You know what I'm going to do?

998
00:42:25.685 --> 00:42:27.218
I'm going to Disguise Self and I'm going

999
00:42:27.218 --> 00:42:28.051
to make myself look like the guy.

1000
00:42:28.051 --> 00:42:29.517
MATT: Okay, there you go.

1001
00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:31.859
SAM: But do what he's doing.

1002
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:35.018
LAURA: I'm going to sit and I'm going to start writing, and

1003
00:42:35.018 --> 00:42:36.802
I'm picking at my ear, and picking my nose.

1004
00:42:36.802 --> 00:42:39.670
MARISHA: Do his robes look familiar to any of us?

1005
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.220
MATT: No, the robes don't appear to be a uniform

1006
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:47.130
of any kind, and the individual does not

1007
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:50.899
appear to be familiar to any of you.

1008
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.476
Make a history check, Caleb and Beauregard,

1009
00:42:58.476 --> 00:42:59.355
if you don't mind.

1010
00:42:59.355 --> 00:43:00.864
LIAM: I'm not going with that one.

1011
00:43:00.864 --> 00:43:04.483
LAURA: I'm going to stand up and start dancing like this.

1012
00:43:04.483 --> 00:43:06.133
SAM: You doing a dance as this guy?

1013
00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:07.058
Was he dancing in your memory?

1014
00:43:07.058 --> 00:43:09.083
LAURA: No, but I'm going to make him dance around.

1015
00:43:09.083 --> 00:43:10.690
MARISHA: 20.

1016
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.523
LIAM: 14.

1017
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.830
MATT: Unfortunately, neither of you are able to pick

1018
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.690
out the individual. You don't think you've

1019
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.088
crossed paths with them or there aren't any discerning

1020
00:43:20.088 --> 00:43:24.352
elements. They're youngish, meaning for somebody

1021
00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:26.670
to be wearings such fine clothing

1022
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.465
in the way that you were describing

1023
00:43:28.465 --> 00:43:30.160
and the den that they were in,

1024
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.110
they probably look like late 20s or so.

1025
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.880
TALIESIN: We all know what they look like now,

1026
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.470
so if we run into this person we'll immediately know.

1027
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:43.470
MARISHA: He was speaking into a swirly, glass bowl?

1028
00:43:43.732 --> 00:43:46.252
MATT: No, it wasn't a glass bowl. It was a stone.

1029
00:43:46.252 --> 00:43:49.822
It was about that big around, smooth.

1030
00:43:49.822 --> 00:43:51.050
LIAM: Does it look like this one?

1031
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.820
MATT: It looks similar.

1032
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.571
SAM: What is that one? Did we find that one?

1033
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:58.445
Did we always have that? Did we find that?

1034
00:43:58.445 --> 00:43:59.278
MARISHA: It's his transmuter stone.

1035
00:43:59.278 --> 00:44:01.532
LIAM: I got this in Zadash. No, it's not.

1036
00:44:01.532 --> 00:44:03.550
SAM: Talk into it. Say something.

1037
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.100
LIAM: We got this in Zadash.

1038
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.650
LAURA: We don't know where its buddy is, right?

1039
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.620
LIAM: It's a talking stone.

1040
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.560
It's for communicating with one other person

1041
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.020
and whoever has it and I've just been carrying it.

1042
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.270
SAM: You haven't talked into it yet.

1043
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.240
LIAM: No, because we did not know who was on the other end.

1044
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.073
TRAVIS: (exclamation)

1045
00:44:20.073 --> 00:44:21.750
SAM: Do you want to try?

1046
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.610
Before we do that, was there anything Zadash-y

1047
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.190
about what you were looking at.

1048
00:44:27.275 --> 00:44:30.998
Anything that was like--the zip code was on the--

1049
00:44:30.998 --> 00:44:34.610
anything Zadash-y?

1050
00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.457
LAURA: There was a horse whinnying,

1051
00:44:36.457 --> 00:44:40.530
it sounded Zadash-y like a Zadash-y sort of accent

1052
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.363
on the horse.

1053
00:44:42.528 --> 00:44:44.261
Did the room look anything

1054
00:44:44.261 --> 00:44:45.490
like the Lavish Chateau or anything?

1055
00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:47.590
Was it that nice?

1056
00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:49.704
MATT: No, it looked like it was well--

1057
00:44:49.704 --> 00:44:51.487
LAURA: What was it called?

1058
00:44:51.487 --> 00:44:52.327
TRAVIS: Pillow Top?

1059
00:44:52.327 --> 00:44:53.160
LAURA: The Pillow Top.

1060
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.080
MATT: Oh the Pillow Trove, you mean?

1061
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.122
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah.

1062
00:44:55.122 --> 00:44:58.160
MATT: No, it didn't look like the Pillow Trove.

1063
00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.077
It did look like a nice den, with fine furniture

1064
00:45:02.077 --> 00:45:06.400
more than your standard, you know--merchant

1065
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.112
or noble level, at least.

1066
00:45:10.112 --> 00:45:11.845
LAURA: Okay. It looked like his house.

1067
00:45:11.845 --> 00:45:14.280
It didn't look a like a room he was renting?

1068
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.370
MATT: It seemed to be well-lived in?

1069
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.080
It resembled to be an abode, as opposed

1070
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.470
to a stay at an inn.

1071
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.790
TRAVIS: Well, let's go embarrass this fucker

1072
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.693
and go collect.

1073
00:45:26.693 --> 00:45:27.974
SAM: You're not going to talk into the stone?

1074
00:45:27.974 --> 00:45:29.092
LIAM: Well, here's the thing.

1075
00:45:29.092 --> 00:45:31.792
This belonged to that merchant,

1076
00:45:31.792 --> 00:45:34.674
and we fucked his life, don't you remember?

1077
00:45:34.674 --> 00:45:36.300
There was the judge and the wealthy merchant.

1078
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.717
MATT: Lord Suutan.

1079
00:45:37.717 --> 00:45:40.420
LIAM: Yeah, and we burned both their--

1080
00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.550
LAURA: And we took his stone.

1081
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.460
LIAM: Took the stone. But if we fucked his life up--

1082
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.400
LAURA: Beau, remember you almost died in that rug!

1083
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.036
That was so sad.

1084
00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:49.904
TALIESIN: There is something to be said about

1085
00:45:49.904 --> 00:45:52.670
not starting a fire in a closed cave.

1086
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.589
I think, perhaps, this isn't the place.

1087
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:56.485
TRAVIS: Well, we didn't start the fire.

1088
00:45:56.485 --> 00:45:57.398
SAM: Was it always burning?

1089
00:45:57.398 --> 00:45:58.985
MARISHA: Since the world's been turning.

1090
00:45:58.985 --> 00:46:00.195
LIAM: Get out. Get out.

1091
00:46:00.195 --> 00:46:01.806
TALIESIN: Never mind. Never mind.

1092
00:46:01.806 --> 00:46:04.499
(laughter)

1093
00:46:04.499 --> 00:46:07.057
MATT: The Landspeaker stands up and says, "You ready to go?"

1094
00:46:07.057 --> 00:46:08.807
(laughter)

1095
00:46:08.807 --> 00:46:10.435
SAM: All right, let's go back.

1096
00:46:10.435 --> 00:46:15.380
MARISHA: This is not a good look for the Empire.

1097
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.257
In terms of--if this is the person

1098
00:46:18.257 --> 00:46:20.198
planting stones.
LAURA: I turn myself back into me.

1099
00:46:20.198 --> 00:46:22.104
LIAM: The Empire has not looked good in a long time.

1100
00:46:22.104 --> 00:46:23.097
TALIESIN: That was a lot of hair.

1101
00:46:23.097 --> 00:46:25.538
LAURA: That was a lot of very blonde hair.

1102
00:46:25.538 --> 00:46:26.760
SAM: All right, let's go.

1103
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.152
LAURA: As we leave, I just give Yasha a hug on the way out.

1104
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:33.615
ASHLEY: I give her some pats on the back.

1105
00:46:33.615 --> 00:46:35.283
MATT: (patting)

1106
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.428
LIAM: First, we're going to the fort, right?

1107
00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.401
SAM: Oh yeah, to drop off the giant.

1108
00:46:40.401 --> 00:46:41.390
TALIESIN: Drop off the giant,

1109
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:43.990
make sure everybody clears out nice and orderly.

1110
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:48.370
MATT: You guys exit out into the stormy day,

1111
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.690
the dark clouded sky above you.

1112
00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.280
You put up your hoods and your cloaks

1113
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.720
and bundle up.

1114
00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.210
Now, you had taken the moorbounders...?

1115
00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.200
SAM: We did. We took them as far as we could go.

1116
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.719
MATT: As far as you could go,

1117
00:47:01.719 --> 00:47:03.860
up to the mountain pass and then left them outside.

1118
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.421
As you step out to where you left them,

1119
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:07.730
you don't see them.

1120
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.517
(groaning)

1121
00:47:10.517 --> 00:47:13.905
LAURA: Yarnball! Yarnball!

1122
00:47:13.905 --> 00:47:15.587
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

1123
00:47:15.587 --> 00:47:16.678
SAM: Jannik!

1124
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:20.623
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

1125
00:47:20.623 --> 00:47:23.130
LAURA: (groans)

1126
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.171
LIAM: Jannik!

1127
00:47:24.171 --> 00:47:26.277
ASHLEY: Can I try to give a really loud

1128
00:47:26.277 --> 00:47:28.518
battle whistle? To see if they come?

1129
00:47:28.518 --> 00:47:29.702
MATT: Sure. Make a performance check.

1130
00:47:29.702 --> 00:47:32.201
SAM: Performance check.
TRAVIS: --attack your ass.

1131
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:33.042
LIAM: 23.
ASHLEY: Oh no,

1132
00:47:33.042 --> 00:47:36.790
that's a negative two for performance.

1133
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:38.010
11.

1134
00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:39.318
MATT: Okay.

1135
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.930
Between you whistling very loudly, you calling

1136
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:43.982
for your moorbounder--

1137
00:47:43.982 --> 00:47:45.480
TRAVIS: (whistles)

1138
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.280
MATT: One by one, they begin to emerge

1139
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.530
from the base of the woods.

1140
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.510
They were pack hunting and, as they come up

1141
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.420
and emerge, you can see

1142
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.700
chunks of stringy spider flesh in their jaws.

1143
00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.094
TALIESIN: Good for you.

1144
00:47:59.094 --> 00:48:00.520
LAURA: Oh, Yarnball.

1145
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.170
MATT: They all come bounding up and leap,

1146
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.840
and skid to halt, stumbling,

1147
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.170
knocking Jester off onto the muddy floor

1148
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:08.440
and begins licking your face,

1149
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.470
these long streaks of spider blood

1150
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.130
left on the side of your cheek.

1151
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.365
LAURA: Careful, you're going to have the runs for days.

1152
00:48:15.365 --> 00:48:17.780
MATT: (snorting)

1153
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.320
LIAM: <i>Halt.</i>

1154
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.436
MATT: (growling)

1155
00:48:21.436 --> 00:48:23.277
LIAM: (scratching)

1156
00:48:23.277 --> 00:48:25.049
MATT: (growling diminishes)

1157
00:48:25.049 --> 00:48:26.912
TRAVIS: So weird.

1158
00:48:28.004 --> 00:48:30.018
LAURA: Yarnball, speak.

1159
00:48:30.018 --> 00:48:31.427
MATT: (retches)

1160
00:48:31.427 --> 00:48:33.302
(laughter)

1161
00:48:33.302 --> 00:48:34.370
LAURA: Nice.

1162
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.820
MATT: Grabbing your monstrous moorbounders,

1163
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.932
you all get back to your riding positions, I assume.

1164
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:45.700
The Landspeaker leads on

1165
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.620
and guides you back on the path,

1166
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.940
where you initially came.

1167
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.630
Heading down the mountainous journey

1168
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.046
alongside this part of the Penumbra Range,

1169
00:48:54.046 --> 00:48:56.560
trying to keep from getting too waterlogged,

1170
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.730
but the rain is pretty intense.

1171
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.410
Eventually, you come to the base

1172
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:02.360
of the Vermaloc Wildwood.

1173
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.450
Very plain to see the path, once again,

1174
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.410
that the giants took to rapidly escape

1175
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.330
from the incursion at the Braan.

1176
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:09.750
You can see the branches still broken

1177
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.160
and pushed in. There is a makeshift tunnel

1178
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.660
that is formed that you initially took here.

1179
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.720
You just--(burps) Pardon me--

1180
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.960
get back on your path--

1181
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.050
trying to hold that back, but it caught up to me.

1182
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.833
Apologies, everyone.

1183
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.530
Continue onward, making your way back towards

1184
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.772
the Deepriver Mines and the Icozrin Steelworks.

1185
00:49:30.772 --> 00:49:32.210
For the most part of the journey,

1186
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:33.400
you can still see the webs,

1187
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.940
they're still burned away from the first time

1188
00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.340
you came through, and the Landspeaker,

1189
00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.660
once again creating the same ball of flame,

1190
00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.920
which resists the rain. You actually watch

1191
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.820
as this coat of mist and steam

1192
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:49.150
continues to drift off of the rolling sphere of fire.

1193
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.110
The rain that seems to be coming through the canopy,

1194
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.150
splattering against it, causes this cloud

1195
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:57.061
to emerge and dissipate around it.

1196
00:49:57.061 --> 00:50:00.550
The rolling ball manages to keep most of the side

1197
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.063
spiders that you see still waiting up

1198
00:50:03.063 --> 00:50:05.580
in the boughs of the trees,

1199
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.535
skittering and pulling away.

1200
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.290
Not being much of an issue on this journey.

1201
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.740
Continuing onward, eventually you see the familiar

1202
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.960
and comfortable sight of the high exterior walls

1203
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.310
of the Deepriver Mine.

1204
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.310
You approach. The side gate is still closed,

1205
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:26.014
but Landspeaker, leading the cause,

1206
00:50:26.014 --> 00:50:29.473
comes up to the outside and shouts out in Giant,

1207
00:50:29.473 --> 00:50:32.830
"Open, we've arrived." Holds her staff up

1208
00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.170
over the edge and glances over the wall.

1209
00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.970
You hear a couple of heavy footsteps

1210
00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.540
(rumbling footsteps)

1211
00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.230
shifting of wood and creak as it pulls open.

1212
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:44.950
Two of the stone giants

1213
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.450
lift and pull both sides of the gate open

1214
00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.980
to the interior of the Deepriver Mine.

1215
00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.450
You all wade in, the mud clomping

1216
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:56.250
beneath your feet.

1217
00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.790
The temperature is cold enough to where you can see

1218
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:01.150
your breath a bit as you travel.

1219
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.840
Coming inside, all the giants are there,

1220
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.430
still armed, still with their patchwork metal armor

1221
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.180
they've borrowed from the vicinity.

1222
00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.300
Immediately, they begin to question

1223
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.620
and speak with the Landspeaker.

1224
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.450
While most of you hear a bunch of giant speech

1225
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:19.110
back and forth and calls and questions and responses,

1226
00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:20.700
the conversation seems to be them saying,

1227
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.700
"So what happened?" She explains what transpired

1228
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.700
and speaks on your behalf.

1229
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.241
They all look a bit surprised, nod.

1230
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:35.830
They say to her once more, "Do we need this anymore?"

1231
00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:37.224
She says no.

1232
00:51:37.224 --> 00:51:39.530
They all begin to tug on the rope

1233
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:40.961
that they had used to affix all this metal

1234
00:51:40.961 --> 00:51:42.806
plates to themselves as armor.

1235
00:51:42.806 --> 00:51:46.551
They clatter to the ground in these big piles of scrap,

1236
00:51:46.551 --> 00:51:50.090
going back to their more natural state.

1237
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.710
One by one, they all walk up to each of you,

1238
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.930
looming still. They're anywhere from between

1239
00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:57.820
20 feet tall or over, including the main champion,

1240
00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.280
the one that had guided you

1241
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.880
in the intense conversation around the bonfire

1242
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.880
the night that you went and partook of your spider meal.

1243
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:11.823
Gives a nod and, (in Giant) "Droonga,"

1244
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:18.000
and begins walking, which you know means "respect."

1245
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.530
One by one, the giants begin to grab their things.

1246
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.040
They grab a few things from the mine,

1247
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.810
just whatever they happened to find that was interesting,

1248
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.480
trinkets. Some of them have begun to make

1249
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.240
and weave from materials they've found

1250
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.109
to create small art pieces and dolls.

1251
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:38.060
There's a through line in the culture of the stone giants,

1252
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.800
in the time you've spent both with them

1253
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.630
and in their previous home, of craftsmanship.

1254
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.980
Particularly stone working, but they seem

1255
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.801
to be grabbing errant pieces of whatever's around

1256
00:52:47.801 --> 00:52:49.810
that might be useful to them and they've filled up

1257
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:54.700
small sacks and made their way back towards their home.

1258
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.590
Finally, it's just the Landspeaker left.

1259
00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:01.080
Looks over you all and gives a quiet nod,

1260
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.380
eyes closed.

1261
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.580
Turns back to you, Caduceus,

1262
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.440
and she kneels down to where, still all the way down

1263
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.982
and hunched forward, she's just now catching your eye level,

1264
00:53:13.982 --> 00:53:16.080
maybe a little bit above,

1265
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:21.048
and says, "You have a heart that pierces truth.

1266
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.525
"Never ignore your instincts.

1267
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:28.950
"Your companions are lucky to have you,

1268
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.230
"for most are lost in our crazy world of dreams

1269
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.330
"without someone to wake them."

1270
00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.730
TALIESIN: Thank you for your wisdom.

1271
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:39.640
Good luck out there.

1272
00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.833
MATT: "You as well.

1273
00:53:41.833 --> 00:53:45.052
"I hope you find your interests,"

1274
00:53:46.055 --> 00:53:49.271
and she stands up, grabs the staff.

1275
00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:52.362
LAURA and ASHLEY: (speaks gibberish)

1276
00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:54.350
TALIESIN: You know what they're trying to say.

1277
00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:56.566
MATT: She laughs.

1278
00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:58.284
TRAVIS: (imitates Giant)

1279
00:53:58.284 --> 00:53:59.730
MATT: (corrects his Giant pronunciation)

1280
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:01.088
LAURA: (attempts to imitate Matt)
MATT: There you go.

1281
00:54:02.421 --> 00:54:05.620
And with that, walks away, footfalls getting fainter

1282
00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.750
and fainter as you see the last of the stone giants

1283
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:09.630
making their way towards the west

1284
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:11.840
to the home that you helped free for them.

1285
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.760
Until, eventually, the mine and steelworks are yours,

1286
00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.170
open and empty. You've done it.

1287
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.359
LAURA: Let's steal everything and run!

1288
00:54:18.359 --> 00:54:19.446
SAM: We get to keep the whole mine?

1289
00:54:19.446 --> 00:54:23.300
TRAVIS: Well now, no. We're going to be giving it back.

1290
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.850
ASHLEY: We live here now?

1291
00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:26.069
LAURA: It's ours.

1292
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:27.244
SAM: I call this room!

1293
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.980
TALIESIN: Are there piles of armor on the ground now?

1294
00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.063
Is that just--they just sort of--?

1295
00:54:34.063 --> 00:54:36.200
MATT: It's scrap. It's scrap that was

1296
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.946
tied together to form a makeshift scale mail.

1297
00:54:39.946 --> 00:54:42.490
TALIESIN: You want to do a thing with me really quickly?

1298
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.810
LAURA: Yeah.

1299
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to start taking cantrip

1300
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.080
potshots at these things and banging them up real good.

1301
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.230
Make it look like there was a tussle.

1302
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.050
LAURA: Ooh yeah, me too.

1303
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.966
I'm going to use my axe and hit a couple.

1304
00:54:53.966 --> 00:54:55.900
SAM: What are you hitting?

1305
00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.198
LAURA: The armor.

1306
00:54:58.459 --> 00:55:00.010
LAURA and TALIESIN: Banging them up.

1307
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.370
TALIESIN: Leaving a couple burn marks around.

1308
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:03.203
MATT: Okay.

1309
00:55:03.203 --> 00:55:04.036
TALIESIN: Making the fight look a little

1310
00:55:04.036 --> 00:55:05.197
bigger than it was.

1311
00:55:05.197 --> 00:55:07.877
SAM: Should we break some windows and doors and things?

1312
00:55:07.877 --> 00:55:10.835
LAURA: Yeah, I run over and break a window.

1313
00:55:10.835 --> 00:55:15.053
MATT: Jester just runs and fucking destroys two windows.

1314
00:55:15.053 --> 00:55:16.739
LAURA: (screams)

1315
00:55:17.864 --> 00:55:19.855
TALIESIN: I let her, I guess, get it out of her system.

1316
00:55:19.855 --> 00:55:21.340
MATT: It's great. It's like watching

1317
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.980
somebody deface the outside of a condemned building.

1318
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.960
The whole place is just in complete disarray

1319
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.020
from the fight that took place originally

1320
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.870
when they arrived, so you have indeed added

1321
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.700
to the chaos.

1322
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.370
TALIESIN: I say we just head back

1323
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:41.193
and tell them how easy it was at this point.

1324
00:55:41.193 --> 00:55:42.500
SAM: Yeah, where are they all hiding out,

1325
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.410
all the human people?

1326
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.380
TALIESIN: Back that ways a spell.

1327
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.630
SAM: Okay.

1328
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:49.326
MATT: The makeshift tent city

1329
00:55:49.326 --> 00:55:50.826
on the outside of the Vermaloc.

1330
00:55:50.826 --> 00:55:54.570
TRAVIS: Anyone want to take that locket

1331
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:56.320
and do anything with it?

1332
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.970
MARISHA: Can we do a dramatic reading of his letter?

1333
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.996
TRAVIS: That is nice.

1334
00:56:01.996 --> 00:56:03.460
SAM: That's a good idea.

1335
00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.499
Maybe- do you have any magic that could make it--?

1336
00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:08.990
LAURA: I could Disguise Self as the girl

1337
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:10.512
in the locket.

1338
00:56:10.512 --> 00:56:12.662
SAM: I could turn myself as Bodo.

1339
00:56:13.882 --> 00:56:15.650
TALIESIN: This feels complicated.

1340
00:56:17.276 --> 00:56:18.723
LAURA: What if I make myself look like the girl

1341
00:56:18.723 --> 00:56:21.400
and you make yourself look like Bodo?

1342
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.233
SAM: Sure.

1343
00:56:22.233 --> 00:56:24.724
LAURA: And then we like just (grunts)

1344
00:56:24.724 --> 00:56:26.514
SAM: Yeah, yeah, just yeah.

1345
00:56:26.514 --> 00:56:27.741
MARISHA: Can you Thaumaturgy my voice

1346
00:56:27.741 --> 00:56:30.630
so it's super loud?

1347
00:56:32.137 --> 00:56:33.385
LIAM: I don't think I can do that.

1348
00:56:33.385 --> 00:56:34.218
MARISHA: Where's that dollar?

1349
00:56:36.337 --> 00:56:38.084
SAM: What?

1350
00:56:38.084 --> 00:56:39.817
LAURA: No, do it again! You almost just touched it again!

1351
00:56:39.817 --> 00:56:42.320
LIAM: Patted the surgery shoulder.

1352
00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.199
I'm good, we're good. We're good here, everything's good.

1353
00:56:46.199 --> 00:56:48.840
SAM: Your arm's on fire right now.

1354
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.890
LIAM: How are you?

1355
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.060
MARISHA: You can't do that?

1356
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.800
TALIESIN: I can do that.

1357
00:56:57.950 --> 00:57:00.194
MARISHA: You can do that?
TALIESIN: I can do that.

1358
00:57:00.194 --> 00:57:02.570
SAM: Fjord, do you do Disguise Self? I've forgotten.

1359
00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:03.600
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1360
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.730
SAM: You know, I think he's a better body type

1361
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:07.846
to be Bodo.

1362
00:57:07.846 --> 00:57:09.246
MATT: Thaumaturgy can affect your own voice

1363
00:57:09.246 --> 00:57:10.079
not somebody else's.

1364
00:57:10.079 --> 00:57:10.912
TALIESIN: Oh, I can't do that.

1365
00:57:10.912 --> 00:57:12.560
LAURA: You make yourself look like Bodo,

1366
00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.986
I'll be the--

1367
00:57:13.986 --> 00:57:17.350
SAM: You guys can simulate making out.

1368
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:18.700
TRAVIS: What are we doing?

1369
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.310
LAURA: Just in front of everyone.

1370
00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:22.650
SAM: Just simulation, just going to act out

1371
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:23.880
to go with our story.

1372
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.880
TALIESIN: Junior high school theater.

1373
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.910
MARISHA: And Beau's going to--

1374
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:27.482
ASHLEY: Like an interpretive letter?

1375
00:57:27.482 --> 00:57:30.850
LAURA: Yeah, we'll act out the letter.

1376
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:32.140
TRAVIS: All right, I don't know if I understand,

1377
00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.924
but I guess I'll just follow your lead.

1378
00:57:33.924 --> 00:57:35.180
SAM: Follow her lead.

1379
00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:38.050
LIAM: Save your spells because I can

1380
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.580
change the way everyone looks,

1381
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.860
so if we want to do a whole--

1382
00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:45.457
the director's not even paying attention--

1383
00:57:46.946 --> 00:57:48.929
Just say I'm back and then you're back.

1384
00:57:49.998 --> 00:57:52.190
I can make everyone look like anything you want,

1385
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:54.190
so if you want to have multiple people

1386
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:57.090
as part of your production.
LAURA: Well, yeah let's make

1387
00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.370
half of us look like the girl

1388
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:59.350
and half look like him.

1389
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:02.210
TRAVIS: Wow, that seems like taking it to a real--

1390
00:58:03.378 --> 00:58:06.002
LAURA: Oh! And the we could just do a dance

1391
00:58:06.002 --> 00:58:06.894
and have an orgy.

1392
00:58:06.894 --> 00:58:08.360
TRAVIS: It's getting a little Caligula in here.

1393
00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.970
I feel like we don't quite need that much.

1394
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:13.208
ASHLEY: If there are more players in the story,

1395
00:58:13.208 --> 00:58:16.800
as you read, maybe you can decide and bamf one of us

1396
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.081
into one of the new characters.

1397
00:58:18.081 --> 00:58:19.639
TRAVIS: You know, what we don't

1398
00:58:19.639 --> 00:58:22.280
need to talk about this. We should just do it.

1399
00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.280
MARISHA: Yasha, can I get up on your shoulders

1400
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.835
so we have a bit of a stage?
ASHLEY: Yes.

1401
00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:26.668
MARISHA: Thank you.

1402
00:58:26.668 --> 00:58:28.060
ASHLEY: Come on.

1403
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.240
MARISHA: Do you have the letter?

1404
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:31.700
MATT: No, we're making this up.

1405
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.950
You get to read the letter

1406
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:38.700
because I didn't think this would be a thing.

1407
00:58:39.932 --> 00:58:42.800
Great, guys. All right, so.

1408
00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:45.322
TRAVIS: Let's take it back to the tits.

1409
00:58:45.322 --> 00:58:46.240
MATT: Riding your moorbounders through

1410
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.330
the Vermaloc eastward through the beautiful

1411
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:53.130
red and deep burgundy leaves,

1412
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:56.250
the dark purple smooth barked trees,

1413
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.220
you find paths that led you initially

1414
00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.230
to the mining camp.

1415
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:01.900
As you exit the tree line,

1416
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:06.160
you can see, about maybe ten minutes due north

1417
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.620
of where you're currently standing,

1418
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.290
this same tent city that you originally

1419
00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:11.740
encountered upon your arrival.

1420
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.890
Making your way in that direction.

1421
00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:15.660
As you get closer and closer, you can see

1422
00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:17.996
some of the camp has just been

1423
00:59:17.996 --> 00:59:20.218
in a holding pattern and most people

1424
00:59:20.218 --> 00:59:22.398
are siting around on stumps

1425
00:59:22.398 --> 00:59:24.784
or on boxes and crates with card games

1426
00:59:24.784 --> 00:59:26.399
or whatever else they can do to pass the time.

1427
00:59:26.399 --> 00:59:30.018
Some of them are just taking naps midday.

1428
00:59:32.176 --> 00:59:33.509
Nevertheless, you approach the same tent

1429
00:59:33.509 --> 00:59:35.252
where the foreman had previously

1430
00:59:35.252 --> 00:59:39.144
come to greet you. Does not appear to be there immediately,

1431
00:59:39.144 --> 00:59:40.360
but as you approach, one of the guards,

1432
00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:44.788
one of the Aurora Guards comes up to you.

1433
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.357
Now, are you all just yourselves right now?

1434
00:59:48.357 --> 00:59:49.228
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

1435
00:59:49.228 --> 00:59:50.769
MATT: All right.

1436
00:59:50.769 --> 00:59:55.769
Approaches. "Right, do you need the foreman?"

1437
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:57.360
SAM: Yes, please.

1438
00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.120
LAURA: Very much so.

1439
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.338
MATT: "Be right back,"

1440
01:00:00.338 --> 01:00:01.628
and he turns around, tells the other guards

1441
01:00:01.628 --> 01:00:02.461
to scatter a bit,

1442
01:00:02.461 --> 01:00:03.987
him and one other are headed inside of the tent.

1443
01:00:05.073 --> 01:00:06.190
The foreman comes out, a pair of glasses

1444
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.964
at the end of his nose. He's currently

1445
01:00:07.964 --> 01:00:10.610
in the process of going through a piece of paper

1446
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.210
and scratching things out angrily,

1447
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:14.448
looks like he's in the middle of a meeting.

1448
01:00:14.448 --> 01:00:17.494
"What might I ask is this problem--

1449
01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:21.432
"Right, right so you've returned.

1450
01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:25.390
"Very well. How did it go?"

1451
01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.900
SAM: We're all here.

1452
01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.250
LIAM: Problem is solved.

1453
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:34.040
LAURA: Giants are kaput.

1454
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.980
TRAVIS: Really not that big of a deal, actually.

1455
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.300
MATT: "Well, that is very impressive.

1456
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.590
"I certainly hope you aren't pulling my leg."

1457
01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.140
TALIESIN: Oh no, we had time to sit around.

1458
01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.580
We actually took a nice long nap afterwards,

1459
01:00:47.526 --> 01:00:48.359
maybe even found some stuff.

1460
01:00:48.359 --> 01:00:49.890
LAURA: Yeah, we go to search around.

1461
01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:51.150
MATT: "Well, that's day of productivity

1462
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:53.050
"that we lost, then, if that is the case.

1463
01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.080
"Nevertheless let's go ahead and get everyone back to work!"

1464
01:00:58.353 --> 01:00:59.840
and he shouts out, "Everyone!"

1465
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.790
LAURA: Everyone!

1466
01:01:02.002 --> 01:01:03.670
MATT: Everyone starts gathering up and hearing this,

1467
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:06.330
LAURA: Gather round we have an announcement to make.

1468
01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:11.330
MATT: He's like, "Yes, everyone, please, I need your ears.

1469
01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.506
"So, it seems--"

1470
01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:16.964
LAURA: It seems.

1471
01:01:18.057 --> 01:01:19.049
MATT: "It seems--"

1472
01:01:19.049 --> 01:01:20.642
LAURA: (in the same way) It seems.

1473
01:01:20.642 --> 01:01:23.277
MARISHA: (giggles)

1474
01:01:23.277 --> 01:01:25.141
LIAM: And Caleb casts Seeming.

1475
01:01:25.141 --> 01:01:27.029
(laughter)

1476
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:30.540
LIAM: And Caduceus and Yasha and Jester

1477
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.300
look like the woman in the locket,

1478
01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.020
and Nott and Caleb and Fjord suddenly

1479
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.940
look like Bodo of different sizes.

1480
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:41.200
MATT: All right. Now he's currently not looking at this,

1481
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.290
he's looking out towards the group,

1482
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:46.151
and he goes, "It seems that these fair

1483
01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:51.151
"mercenaries have been able to remove the giant problem,

1484
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:54.790
"and, as such, it is time to return to work

1485
01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:56.890
"within the Steelworks immediately.

1486
01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.970
"Please grab your stuff--what are you laughing at?"

1487
01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.980
MARISHA: It appears removing problems

1488
01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.294
is a reoccurring theme from you.

1489
01:02:07.294 --> 01:02:09.177
MATT: He turns around. "(sputters)"

1490
01:02:09.177 --> 01:02:10.610
LAURA: Ooh!

1491
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:11.768
MATT: "What is this?"

1492
01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:13.172
TALIESIN: Oh, what happened? It looks like he's seen--

1493
01:02:13.172 --> 01:02:14.514
ASHLEY: I pick up Beau and I put her on--

1494
01:02:14.514 --> 01:02:16.365
TALIESIN: I would say a ghost, but I'm not sure.

1495
01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:19.107
MARISHA: Attention, workers of the mine,

1496
01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.460
we have a very important announcement

1497
01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.740
and news from the mining front.

1498
01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:26.705
It appears--

1499
01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:29.622
MATT: He's trying to hide you,

1500
01:02:29.622 --> 01:02:31.678
the three of you, but there's too many of you.

1501
01:02:31.678 --> 01:02:33.917
MARISHA: It appears your wonderful foreman, Bodo,

1502
01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.510
is quite the poet.

1503
01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.963
And has a mistress.

1504
01:02:40.749 --> 01:02:45.310
The poet, the bodo-et of the poet.

1505
01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:48.140
LAURA: We shall be reenacting such poem

1506
01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:53.140
for you all. I hope you enjoy this wonderful performance.

1507
01:02:54.383 --> 01:02:56.440
LIAM: We give you the Bodo Players!

1508
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.828
MARISHA: Everybody, everybody. (claps)

1509
01:02:57.828 --> 01:03:00.032
MATT: Everyone's like (claps). They're into it.

1510
01:03:00.032 --> 01:03:02.461
He's like, "(whimpers)"

1511
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:05.650
MARISHA: Bodo. Your art deserves to be shared.

1512
01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:06.724
Just let it happen.

1513
01:03:06.724 --> 01:03:08.793
MATT: I will give you gold to stop this.

1514
01:03:08.793 --> 01:03:12.151
MARISHA: (clears throat) My dearest Lorna.

1515
01:03:13.358 --> 01:03:16.090
LAURA: That's me. And her and her.

1516
01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:19.400
MARISHA: Just as your namesake suggests,

1517
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:23.540
you Lorna in my loins.

1518
01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.880
(groaning)

1519
01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:30.370
MARISHA: Night after night, as I lay underneath the stars

1520
01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:31.966
in this encampment.

1521
01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:34.310
MATT: He crumples to his knees.

1522
01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.790
MARISHA: The only encampment I can think of

1523
01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.860
is the warmth of your embrace.

1524
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.760
And the soft supple bosom that you have invited me into.

1525
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.970
LAURA: I grab Nott's little Bodo and push

1526
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:50.803
it against my bosom.

1527
01:03:50.803 --> 01:03:52.253
SAM: (motorboating)

1528
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.740
MARISHA: As I snuggle this lambskin,

1529
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.430
I think of your curly hair,

1530
01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.355
laying on the depths of

1531
01:04:04.355 --> 01:04:08.030
my stomach and loins.

1532
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:09.469
(groaning)

1533
01:04:09.469 --> 01:04:10.963
MATT: He's crawling towards you in the mud,

1534
01:04:10.963 --> 01:04:13.160
the rain just completely soaking him.

1535
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.700
"Please. Please stop."

1536
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.400
MARISHA: I think about the time

1537
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:21.645
that I confessed to you of my romance indigestion.

1538
01:04:21.645 --> 01:04:24.611
(laughter)

1539
01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.120
MARISHA: And the nervousness that you alight

1540
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.450
in the depth of my bowels.

1541
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:31.737
LAURA: Oh, that's lovely.

1542
01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:35.675
I Thaumaturgy fart noises. I Thaumaturgy fart noises!

1543
01:04:35.675 --> 01:04:38.000
MATT: "(whimpers)"

1544
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.290
MARISHA: But you held my face

1545
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:45.290
and told me, I love every scent that comes from you.

1546
01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:48.280
LAURA: I grab Fjord's face and I say,

1547
01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.555
"I love every scent that comes from you."

1548
01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:52.396
SAM: Kiss him. Kiss him.

1549
01:04:52.396 --> 01:04:55.058
LAURA: (kiss noises)

1550
01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:55.891
And I don't kiss him.

1551
01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:56.724
SAM: Aw.

1552
01:04:56.724 --> 01:04:57.685
MATT: He passes out.

1553
01:04:57.685 --> 01:05:00.466
(cheering)

1554
01:05:00.466 --> 01:05:02.543
MATT: Just (boof) into the mud.

1555
01:05:02.543 --> 01:05:04.160
MARISHA: It pretty much--it's not as fun

1556
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.077
when he isn't here to hear it.

1557
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:09.353
It pretty much just wraps up

1558
01:05:09.353 --> 01:05:12.240
and he talks about how he dreams of her

1559
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.740
and he gets a little flowery some more at the end.

1560
01:05:16.689 --> 01:05:18.840
But, yeah, that's the story of Lorna.

1561
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.097
LAURA: We bow.

1562
01:05:20.097 --> 01:05:21.416
LIAM: Beau-regardless.

1563
01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:23.250
SAM and MARISHA: Beau-regardless.

1564
01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.310
MATT: Some more clapping and cheers.

1565
01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:27.510
You see a lot of the folks seem to be particularly

1566
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:29.590
enjoying this entire display.

1567
01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.720
LAURA: That was good. I think we succeeded.

1568
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.090
SAM: You know, a stunning career.

1569
01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:37.300
LIAM: We're having this discussion all in disguise.

1570
01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.560
MATT: One of the second in command goes,

1571
01:05:40.675 --> 01:05:43.010
"Right, so anyway, gather your things. Back to work."

1572
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.730
And they all start gathering their supplies

1573
01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:45.920
and they start taking down the tents

1574
01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.920
and it seems the encampment is starting

1575
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.090
to make its way back towards where it originally belonged.

1576
01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.648
TRAVIS: I think that's pretty sufficient.

1577
01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:54.006
MARISHA: That works, right?

1578
01:05:54.006 --> 01:05:55.061
TRAVIS: Right, we hightail it out of here.

1579
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:56.240
You guys got it from here?

1580
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.909
MATT: The guards have lifted him up

1581
01:05:57.909 --> 01:05:59.330
and he's just like groggy.

1582
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:00.371
TALIESIN: That may have been the meanest thing

1583
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:01.891
I've done to someone I'm not related to.

1584
01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.108
LAURA: That was pretty mean.

1585
01:06:04.108 --> 01:06:06.025
MATT: They drag him off into the tent.

1586
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.760
SAM: All right, back to town?

1587
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.593
TRAVIS: Yep.

1588
01:06:09.593 --> 01:06:10.426
LAURA: Yeah.

1589
01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:11.259
SAM: Moorbounders!

1590
01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.332
LAURA: (snaps) I make myself look like me again.

1591
01:06:14.656 --> 01:06:17.268
LIAM: (cat yowling)

1592
01:06:17.268 --> 01:06:18.830
MATT: The moorbounders take off.

1593
01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:20.030
Begin heading southward.

1594
01:06:21.217 --> 01:06:24.967
LIAM: Just as embarrassing for us as for him.

1595
01:06:25.844 --> 01:06:26.913
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

1596
01:06:26.913 --> 01:06:28.690
I have no shame.

1597
01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.930
MATT: All righty so, heading southward

1598
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:35.720
you eventually find the original path

1599
01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.162
that had led you up to this area.

1600
01:06:39.112 --> 01:06:41.980
The day presses on,

1601
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:45.200
the sun begins to set just as you begin to see

1602
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.692
the shapes, the jagged outline of

1603
01:06:49.675 --> 01:06:52.441
the ruins of the Ghostlands ahead of you.

1604
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.690
Do you wish to camp for the evening

1605
01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:58.110
on the outskirts, or do you continue

1606
01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:59.700
and press on through the night?

1607
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.130
TRAVIS: We press on into the night.

1608
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:05.830
TALIESIN: How much longer of a ride is it?

1609
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:08.170
MATT: You're looking at another six hours or so.

1610
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:10.517
TALIESIN: That's fine, that's fine.

1611
01:07:10.517 --> 01:07:12.700
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

1612
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.078
MATT: Okay.

1613
01:07:14.078 --> 01:07:15.590
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah.

1614
01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:16.423
MATT: Okay.

1615
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:20.640
Yeah, making all your journey,

1616
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.336
the first day journeyed there

1617
01:07:22.336 --> 01:07:25.032
and then making way--yeah. For the sake of brevity,

1618
01:07:25.032 --> 01:07:26.810
you make your way back towards the roads

1619
01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:29.310
through the Ghostlands during the day.

1620
01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:31.010
Still a low mist that hangs

1621
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:33.231
through most of the broken stone

1622
01:07:33.231 --> 01:07:37.930
and barely recognizable shades

1623
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:39.920
of what were once structures and temples

1624
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.200
and buildings and domiciles and squares.

1625
01:07:44.233 --> 01:07:47.768
Using your imagination, imagine this place

1626
01:07:47.768 --> 01:07:51.243
a lively if violent locale

1627
01:07:51.243 --> 01:07:54.889
but a millennia before.

1628
01:07:54.889 --> 01:07:56.850
You see some shapes shift in the mist

1629
01:07:56.850 --> 01:08:01.850
and it seems the process of your first arrival

1630
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:04.260
and travel through the Ghostlands

1631
01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.430
you begin to think whatever haunts this space

1632
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:10.140
doesn't wait till night time.

1633
01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.690
Pushing on, you pass by a few of the Aurora Watch

1634
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:14.460
that are watching the road as well,

1635
01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.110
stay clear to the center,

1636
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:18.450
and making your way through. Eventually,

1637
01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:21.038
in the early, early morning hours,

1638
01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:25.480
I'd say around two, three in the morning,

1639
01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.890
you begin to breach the outer wall

1640
01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:33.815
and find yourself in the Corona of Rosohna.

1641
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.350
So.

1642
01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:40.980
The city is sparser at this time of night,

1643
01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.660
of course, but there are still various

1644
01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.180
people that live here that do most of their work

1645
01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.440
at night as well, especially when the day-night

1646
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.423
cycle is a little more fluid thanks to the enchantment

1647
01:08:52.423 --> 01:08:53.830
that's placed above this city

1648
01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:55.872
and the surrounding region.

1649
01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.240
Stepping through the muddy streets,

1650
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.097
the storm still raining upon you,

1651
01:09:02.097 --> 01:09:03.810
and you hear the first crack of thunder

1652
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.590
since the night before echo

1653
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:07.565
off the north side.

1654
01:09:11.074 --> 01:09:13.060
You continue onward until eventually

1655
01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:17.690
passing through the Gallimaufry and then making

1656
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:20.690
your way to the abode you had previously

1657
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.608
stayed, the Dim's Inn.

1658
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:31.360
It is practically empty, aside from

1659
01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Gaben, the person who runs the establishment.

1660
01:09:40.286 --> 01:09:43.290
Seems to be resting, eyes half-open

1661
01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:46.050
looking towards the front.

1662
01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:50.990
One patron, another drow elf,

1663
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:53.100
is passed out on a far table,

1664
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.880
tankard still clutched in the right hand.

1665
01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.310
As you step in from the rain,

1666
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:58.730
pushing through the interior,

1667
01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:03.730
dripping, holding the reins on your respective moorbounders,

1668
01:10:03.822 --> 01:10:07.996
Gaben shakes back to lucidity.

1669
01:10:09.621 --> 01:10:12.890
"Oh, welcome back. You've returned, how nice.

1670
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:16.833
"It is late, but do you require

1671
01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:19.494
"your animals taken care of?"

1672
01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:22.211
LIAM: Yes, please, the usual.

1673
01:10:22.211 --> 01:10:26.350
MATT: "All right. Could you help with that?"

1674
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:27.970
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1675
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:30.458
MATT: You see him nervous and uncomfortable

1676
01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:31.810
around the moorbounders. The moorbounders,

1677
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:33.010
sensing that nervous energy

1678
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:35.146
taking an immediate interest in him.

1679
01:10:35.146 --> 01:10:40.146
LAURA: Yarnball, don't eat him. No, no, no.

1680
01:10:40.345 --> 01:10:43.410
MATT: (huffs) He keeps a wide berth

1681
01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.390
and eventually you lead them to the back

1682
01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:47.740
of the establishment where there is a

1683
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.350
small storage area where he seems

1684
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.260
to be keeping them overnight.

1685
01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:53.030
He doesn't have a place to put these creatures,

1686
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:55.700
but has found a makeshift space for them.

1687
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.416
SAM: While they're doing that, I'm going to

1688
01:10:57.416 --> 01:11:00.350
run upstairs and see if Yeza's home.

1689
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:01.750
MATT: Okay, you come back to the door.

1690
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:03.441
Do you just throw it open?
SAM: Mm-hmm!

1691
01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:07.055
MATT: You look on the bed and suddenly

1692
01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:11.207
a figure leaps from the blanket.

1693
01:11:11.207 --> 01:11:12.832
(scared, surprised shouting)

1694
01:11:12.832 --> 01:11:16.425
SAM: Oh hi, no, it's me, it's me.

1695
01:11:16.425 --> 01:11:18.790
Your wife. Who's a goblin.

1696
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:21.640
MATT: "Right. I was wondering

1697
01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.840
"when you guys were going to come back."

1698
01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.040
SAM: I'm sorry it took so long.

1699
01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.660
MATT: "No, it's okay. You okay?"

1700
01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.220
SAM: Are you okay? Did anything happen?

1701
01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.095
Did you have to kill anyone?

1702
01:11:29.095 --> 01:11:30.730
MATT: "No, no."

1703
01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:31.563
SAM: Good.

1704
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.440
Did anyone visit? Did anyone knock?

1705
01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.000
MATT: "No, they pretty much--"

1706
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.343
SAM: Did they bring you food?

1707
01:11:38.343 --> 01:11:39.176
We arranged for them to bring.

1708
01:11:39.176 --> 01:11:44.100
MATT: "Yeah no, there was food, it was decent.

1709
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.683
"Heard footsteps back and forth.

1710
01:11:45.683 --> 01:11:47.749
"Whenever they did, I'd hide.

1711
01:11:47.749 --> 01:11:51.290
"Just trying to keep a low profile, like you said."

1712
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:53.050
SAM: Was it fun a little bit?

1713
01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.815
MATT: "It was for the first day or two."

1714
01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:56.674
SAM: Sorry.

1715
01:11:56.674 --> 01:11:58.690
MATT: "No, it's fine. I mean, it's far better

1716
01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.920
"than being down in the dungeon.

1717
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.565
"I'll take that (laughs). Hi,"

1718
01:12:04.565 --> 01:12:05.853
and he gets out of the bed

1719
01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:08.169
and comes over and gives you a hug

1720
01:12:09.485 --> 01:12:11.690
and pulls away. "Are we staying here much longer?"

1721
01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:14.210
SAM: I don't know, we have to figure out.

1722
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:15.633
My friends have...

1723
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.872
They're sort of

1724
01:12:19.872 --> 01:12:22.680
trying to figure out a mystery of sorts,

1725
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.550
figuring out what our next move is.

1726
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:27.360
They'll be up here any second now

1727
01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.760
and we need to get you to a safer place

1728
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.740
and we need to find Luc.

1729
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.128
MATT: "Yeah, I'd like that.

1730
01:12:34.128 --> 01:12:35.738
"I'm worried about our boy.

1731
01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:40.674
"Anyway, welcome back."

1732
01:12:40.674 --> 01:12:42.258
SAM: It's good to see you.

1733
01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:45.282
MATT: He wipes some of the crust from his eyes.

1734
01:12:46.282 --> 01:12:48.080
"Are you going to come to sleep?"

1735
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.160
SAM: I mean, yeah. Sure.

1736
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.093
MATT: "Whenever you're ready."
SAM: Sure.

1737
01:12:54.093 --> 01:12:56.320
MATT: "I'm going to go back to sleep."

1738
01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.680
SAM: Okay. I'll be in in a bit.

1739
01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.229
MATT: "Okay." He wanders back, still a little sleepy,

1740
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:05.490
and curls up in the bed and passes right back out.

1741
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:06.975
Eventually, the rest of you return back up

1742
01:13:06.975 --> 01:13:10.570
to the secondary floor of the Dim's Inn.

1743
01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:13.282
TALIESIN: I'm not going to go to sleep quite yet.

1744
01:13:13.282 --> 01:13:15.630
MATT: No worries. Well, you guys are gathered.

1745
01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:18.385
LAURA: The best reunion ever?

1746
01:13:18.385 --> 01:13:21.923
SAM: It was pretty nice, yes. It's good, yeah.

1747
01:13:21.923 --> 01:13:24.080
He only screamed a little bit.

1748
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.270
That's good, that's progress.

1749
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:28.008
LAURA: Yeah, totally.

1750
01:13:28.008 --> 01:13:32.180
SAM: Yeah. I don't know what's next.

1751
01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.780
You know, we have to do something--

1752
01:13:35.272 --> 01:13:36.690
we have to do something as a group,

1753
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:39.764
but then also, I have to figure out what I'm doing.

1754
01:13:41.581 --> 01:13:42.950
LAURA and ASHLEY: What do you mean?

1755
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:46.210
SAM: Well, I mean, he can't stay here forever.

1756
01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:48.050
LAURA: Are you going to stay here?

1757
01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.680
SAM: I don't know. Are we going to stay here?

1758
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.362
Are you going to stay here?

1759
01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:55.550
LAURA: By here, I mean with us.

1760
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:57.510
Are you going with him or are you going

1761
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:59.080
to hang out with us some more?

1762
01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.890
SAM: I don't know. I don't know.

1763
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:02.360
What are we doing?

1764
01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.050
LIAM: We have only been here

1765
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:08.960
for a few days and we haven't even been here for those days.

1766
01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.925
SAM: We have to go check in with Waccoh.

1767
01:14:12.925 --> 01:14:14.473
LIAM: We have a whole laundry list of things to do.

1768
01:14:14.473 --> 01:14:16.340
We need to collect on our bounty,

1769
01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:19.520
we need to make sure--I need to do some homework,

1770
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.840
I need some time to study so that we can get

1771
01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.340
Jester the ability to visit her home

1772
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.760
and so that we can get to your boy,

1773
01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.840
and I would like to visit the libraries here,

1774
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.600
and we want to continue to ally ourselves

1775
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.590
with these people and gain their trust.

1776
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:38.080
We're not going to stay here forever,

1777
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.630
but we have a purpose here,

1778
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:42.547
don't we?

1779
01:14:42.547 --> 01:14:43.557
TRAVIS: I agree.
LAURA: At least

1780
01:14:43.557 --> 01:14:44.590
for two weeks until

1781
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:47.140
we figure out what the deal is with the Overcrow.

1782
01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.630
TRAVIS: But I agree also with Nott,

1783
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:52.980
that your husband can't stay here.

1784
01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.440
It's too dangerous. We can't keep him locked

1785
01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.250
in a room. Are you thinking of sending

1786
01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:58.530
him to be with your son?

1787
01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:00.148
SAM: I can't send him.

1788
01:15:00.148 --> 01:15:02.541
LAURA: Well, if Caleb keeps doing some research

1789
01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:04.680
then, yeah, you can.

1790
01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.320
TALIESIN: Don't we have a way of possibly

1791
01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.137
moving people to that?

1792
01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.841
LIAM: I am close, I just need time.

1793
01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.380
We need sleep now, but I need time.

1794
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.476
I need about a day.

1795
01:15:16.476 --> 01:15:17.610
SAM: Oh, I'm sure he can wait a day.

1796
01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:19.810
LAURA: Also, the Bright Queen has a teleportation

1797
01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:21.520
thingy. Maybe if she likes us enough

1798
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.902
then she can use it and you can send him with that.

1799
01:15:24.902 --> 01:15:26.360
SAM: Mm-hmm. That would be good.

1800
01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.263
LIAM: Also, I'm curious: do you wish

1801
01:15:30.263 --> 01:15:33.120
to, at some point, get into contact

1802
01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.700
with your higher up?

1803
01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.500
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

1804
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.120
LIAM: We could use her. Everything

1805
01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.120
has changed since we spoke to her last.

1806
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.760
We have so much more leverage than we had before

1807
01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.626
and we could do something together.

1808
01:15:48.626 --> 01:15:51.279
We could do something together.

1809
01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:52.825
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: The lot of us.

1810
01:15:52.825 --> 01:15:53.658
SAM: Mm-hmm.

1811
01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:59.670
Well, but tonight we sleep, I suppose.

1812
01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:01.991
LIAM: Yeah, we have to think granule,

1813
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:03.715
bit by bit.

1814
01:16:03.715 --> 01:16:04.735
LAURA: Granul-arly?
LIAM: Gradularly.

1815
01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:06.101
ASHLEY: That's not right either, actually.

1816
01:16:06.101 --> 01:16:06.955
MARISHA: It's hard.

1817
01:16:06.955 --> 01:16:09.872
LIAM: It's hard with the accent. Granularly.

1818
01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:12.870
We should do one thing at a time.

1819
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:14.940
We should all go to bed probably

1820
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.870
and go collect and then we pick

1821
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:20.440
which of the things on our to-do list is next.

1822
01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:24.062
TALIESIN: I can borrow Ms. Beau for a moment outside,

1823
01:16:24.062 --> 01:16:26.190
just for me to finish up a quick thing,

1824
01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:27.180
if that'd be all right.

1825
01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.860
MARISHA: Yeah, whatever you need.

1826
01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.880
TALIESIN: Perfect. I'm going to hand you a shovel.

1827
01:16:31.856 --> 01:16:33.654
MARISHA: Okay.

1828
01:16:33.654 --> 01:16:34.920
TALIESIN: You'll like it.

1829
01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:41.014
I'm going to go out back and set up

1830
01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:46.829
the little goblin body on the back wall in the rain,

1831
01:16:46.829 --> 01:16:49.120
while you dig a little hole for me.

1832
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.992
MARISHA: Wait, is this the burnt crispy one?

1833
01:16:52.992 --> 01:16:56.170
You dragged a burnt crispy goblin body

1834
01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:58.000
eight hours across?

1835
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.950
TALIESIN: I carefully carried it.

1836
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:02.354
Goblin body for eight hours across.

1837
01:17:02.354 --> 01:17:04.046
MARISHA: I'm surprised it still has all of its limbs.

1838
01:17:04.046 --> 01:17:05.479
TALIESIN: I was very gentle.

1839
01:17:06.687 --> 01:17:10.371
MARISHA: I was wondering where that smell was--

1840
01:17:10.371 --> 01:17:12.982
anyway, let's do this.

1841
01:17:12.982 --> 01:17:14.559
TALIESIN: While she digs,

1842
01:17:14.559 --> 01:17:15.680
I'm going to set up everything I need

1843
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.540
and I'm going to cast Speak with Dead.

1844
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.966
MATT: Ah. Okay.

1845
01:17:19.966 --> 01:17:23.008
TRAVIS: Ooh good, good, good, yeah, yeah.

1846
01:17:24.392 --> 01:17:25.625
That's awesome.

1847
01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.093
MATT: The incense you have to cover

1848
01:17:28.093 --> 01:17:29.880
with your hand a bit because of the nature of the rain.

1849
01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.488
TALIESIN: I've got the cloak up.
MATT: You have the cloak up

1850
01:17:31.488 --> 01:17:32.321
and you have it there

1851
01:17:32.321 --> 01:17:35.240
as the incense fills your nose,

1852
01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.780
and burns your eyes a little bit. They tear up,

1853
01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.488
but it's not unpleasant necessarily.

1854
01:17:40.488 --> 01:17:41.990
As you're digging, you're just soaking

1855
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.570
in the rain. You look over and you can see

1856
01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:45.340
the glow of the embers of the incense

1857
01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.690
lighting up the bottom of Clay's face,

1858
01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:50.590
and for as sweet as a man as he is,

1859
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:54.200
it looks almost ominous in this one visual representation.

1860
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.806
TALIESIN: It's not really something

1861
01:17:55.806 --> 01:17:57.535
we're supposed to do very often.

1862
01:17:57.535 --> 01:17:59.340
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1863
01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.030
MATT: You complete the ritual,

1864
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:04.060
and as you do, the tiny charred goblin corpse

1865
01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:09.060
gently propped up against the side

1866
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:12.333
of the outside wall begins to (clicking).

1867
01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:15.150
The bones clack a bit,

1868
01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:16.930
one of the hands reaches up

1869
01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:19.990
towards its throat and you see the chest

1870
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:21.310
move as if it inhales.

1871
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:25.070
MARISHA: I take the spade and I hold it.

1872
01:18:26.567 --> 01:18:29.282
MATT: (clacking)

1873
01:18:29.282 --> 01:18:33.160
It just holds the breath in the chest and looks towards you.

1874
01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.850
TALIESIN: Hey, turned out real bad,

1875
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:36.490
but we're going to do right by you.

1876
01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:40.632
You're going to be given the most proper burial

1877
01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:42.836
we can, but in the meantime...

1878
01:18:42.836 --> 01:18:47.167
Would you mind telling us what were you doing in that cave?

1879
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:53.353
MATT: "I lived happily in the bone pit.

1880
01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:58.785
"Clan-less, the pit had scraps always.

1881
01:18:58.785 --> 01:19:01.460
"No predators."

1882
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:05.243
TALIESIN: There was a...

1883
01:19:06.903 --> 01:19:10.310
device with crystals and a globe in the bone pit.

1884
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.390
Did you see who put it there?

1885
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:14.770
MATT: "Something rushed through the bones

1886
01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:19.770
"one day in the dark. I stayed still, not seen.

1887
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:25.370
"Human it was, hid shiny thing down there.

1888
01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.940
"Tried to chew it, but broke teeth,

1889
01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.180
"so left it no bother."

1890
01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.348
TALIESIN: That was very, very smart.

1891
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:39.270
Human. You sure--could you describe the human

1892
01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.760
or anything you noticed about the human?

1893
01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.690
MATT: "Too dark, too covered in bones hiding.

1894
01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:51.690
"Did not want to be found, humans make goblins dead."

1895
01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.801
TALIESIN: Two more.

1896
01:19:55.843 --> 01:20:00.335
Did the human seem to move magically fast,

1897
01:20:00.335 --> 01:20:02.935
faster than a normal creature would?

1898
01:20:02.935 --> 01:20:05.862
MATT: "Did not see, too scared."

1899
01:20:07.528 --> 01:20:10.030
LAURA: Maybe ask how long ago it was?

1900
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:12.258
TRAVIS: Did it fall in love before it died?

1901
01:20:12.258 --> 01:20:13.347
TALIESIN: None of you get to,

1902
01:20:13.347 --> 01:20:14.891
only you because you're the only one there.

1903
01:20:14.891 --> 01:20:18.412
MARISHA: I don't know what you ask--okay.

1904
01:20:20.992 --> 01:20:25.370
Maybe ask him how long he was there,

1905
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:28.620
if he started dealing with the invasion.

1906
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:32.095
TALIESIN: How long ago did that happen, would you say?

1907
01:20:33.494 --> 01:20:34.885
MATT: "Hmm.

1908
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:39.650
"17 days, maybe."

1909
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:42.714
TALIESIN: Rest.

1910
01:20:42.714 --> 01:20:43.547
MATT: (exhale)

1911
01:20:44.637 --> 01:20:46.455
The head cracks down.

1912
01:20:46.455 --> 01:20:49.000
TALIESIN: Put in the hole, cover it up.

1913
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.230
And now we know it works quickly.

1914
01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:52.723
MARISHA: Yeah, it lines up with exactly

1915
01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:55.468
what the giants were saying.

1916
01:20:55.468 --> 01:20:56.569
All right.

1917
01:20:56.569 --> 01:20:58.821
TALIESIN: He wasn't in there, that was just--

1918
01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:04.318
It's just flesh, not a soul, not anymore.

1919
01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:08.471
TRAVIS: Kid slayer, NPC slayer.

1920
01:21:08.471 --> 01:21:09.754
TALIESIN: Just making me talk, man.

1921
01:21:10.607 --> 01:21:13.985
MATT: You inter the charred goblin corpse.

1922
01:21:13.985 --> 01:21:18.985
Pat the mud and dirt down. The rain hasn't let up

1923
01:21:18.985 --> 01:21:20.912
and it's getting colder and colder.

1924
01:21:20.912 --> 01:21:23.920
This early, early dark morning hour,

1925
01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.850
your breath with every exhale seems to emerge

1926
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:29.480
in this little space between buildings.

1927
01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.850
Eventually, you guys make your way back

1928
01:21:30.850 --> 01:21:32.870
up into the inn to your rooms

1929
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:35.298
to dry off a bit and shake off the weather.

1930
01:21:35.298 --> 01:21:37.380
MARISHA: As we're walking back up:

1931
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.046
Hey, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1932
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.547
MARISHA: How do you know if you're

1933
01:21:42.547 --> 01:21:44.338
special?

1934
01:21:45.764 --> 01:21:47.500
TALIESIN: I don't understand the question.

1935
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.360
MARISHA: Well, you all have gods

1936
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.100
who have taken an interest in you

1937
01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:55.075
or some weird phenomenon that's happened.

1938
01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.467
TALIESIN: I mean, I lived my whole life

1939
01:22:00.467 --> 01:22:05.217
in pretty much less than...

1940
01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.220
A small square of land. Everything's interesting

1941
01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:14.278
at this point. I don't really understand what you mean.

1942
01:22:14.278 --> 01:22:17.200
MARISHA: Well, <i>you're</i> interesting, you know that, right?

1943
01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.195
TALIESIN: Thank you, I didn't. That's interesting.

1944
01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.501
(laughter)

1945
01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:24.610
MARISHA: The things you can do, that's--
TALIESIN: Sure.

1946
01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:26.378
Plenty of people in my family

1947
01:22:26.378 --> 01:22:28.300
can do things like this or do this,

1948
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:32.205
have done this. I'm pretty typical.

1949
01:22:33.042 --> 01:22:33.875
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1950
01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:36.350
Can you follow a god if someone else tells you to?

1951
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:39.110
Or they say, "This is what we're doing now?"

1952
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:41.460
That's all the monks did to me.

1953
01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.050
TALIESIN: I think you can. I don't necessarily

1954
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:45.628
think that's the...

1955
01:22:48.437 --> 01:22:51.150
I don't think that is necessarily the best way

1956
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:54.430
to unfold one's destiny, if that's the sort of thing

1957
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.010
that one is looking for.

1958
01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:57.600
Feels like fighting against the tide,

1959
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.370
if you know what I mean.

1960
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:01.950
MARISHA: Seems like the gods all chose you.

1961
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:06.210
TALIESIN: I wasn't chosen.

1962
01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:07.670
MARISHA: But you believe in destiny.

1963
01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:11.317
TALIESIN: I do. Very much so.

1964
01:23:14.939 --> 01:23:17.180
But, my family came to this through...

1965
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:22.880
Through destiny. I was born into it through destiny,

1966
01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:26.213
and I continue to live through it through destiny.

1967
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.073
I mean, the question is: Where do you think you're going?

1968
01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:35.840
Where would you like to go?

1969
01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.880
MARISHA: I get to choose that on a day-to-day basis,

1970
01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.870
and that's what makes me happy.

1971
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:43.942
TALIESIN: Well, that's part of what makes destiny work.

1972
01:23:45.170 --> 01:23:47.240
There's a lot of free will involved.

1973
01:23:49.523 --> 01:23:53.600
MARISHA: I like that. Let's go to bed.

1974
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.810
LAURA: Before they come in the room--

1975
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:57.720
I'm alone, right?

1976
01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.690
MATT: If you choose to be.

1977
01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:02.030
LAURA: I mean, in our room. I was only rooming with Beau.

1978
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:03.621
MATT: That's true, yeah.

1979
01:24:03.621 --> 01:24:08.462
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending on

1980
01:24:08.462 --> 01:24:10.145
The Gentleman.

1981
01:24:11.445 --> 01:24:12.533
MATT: Okay.

1982
01:24:18.495 --> 01:24:21.073
LAURA: Hi Dad, it's Jester.

1983
01:24:24.289 --> 01:24:28.560
I know it's been a while since we were in Zadash,

1984
01:24:30.303 --> 01:24:34.055
but just thinking about you.

1985
01:24:36.714 --> 01:24:37.547
I miss you.

1986
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:46.615
You miss me?

1987
01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.977
MATT: There's a pause.

1988
01:24:58.090 --> 01:25:00.910
Then a somewhat tired voice responds.

1989
01:25:03.254 --> 01:25:05.671
TRAVIS: Three in the morning.
MATT: Yeah.

1990
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.960
"You're being ridiculous.

1991
01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.276
"I'm not your father, but

1992
01:25:12.276 --> 01:25:15.270
I'm glad you're all right,

1993
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:17.070
"wherever you are.

1994
01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.400
"Come back some time. I've got more work.

1995
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:23.460
"More money to be made."

1996
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.368
SAM: Love you, bye.

1997
01:25:29.368 --> 01:25:31.803
(laughter)

1998
01:25:31.803 --> 01:25:33.425
MATT: That's as much as he gets out.

1999
01:25:40.587 --> 01:25:43.370
LAURA: I send a message.
MATT: Okay.

2000
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:45.970
LAURA: To my mom.
MATT: Okay.

2001
01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:48.650
LAURA: Hi mom,

2002
01:25:50.626 --> 01:25:52.342
I'm really far away,

2003
01:25:53.184 --> 01:25:55.167
it's been crazy here,

2004
01:25:56.050 --> 01:26:00.130
I love you, I miss you.

2005
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:01.177
Do you miss me?

2006
01:26:01.177 --> 01:26:02.902
MARISHA: Aww!

2007
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:10.880
LAURA: We fought some dead giants. I talked to dad.

2008
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.135
TRAVIS: "I talked--"

2009
01:26:12.135 --> 01:26:14.718
(laughter)

2010
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.270
MATT: Another moment passes,

2011
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:22.351
and then another tired voice comes through

2012
01:26:22.351 --> 01:26:25.151
on the opposite side.

2013
01:26:25.151 --> 01:26:26.550
"Jester?

2014
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:29.490
"Oh my Jester, I'm so glad you're okay.

2015
01:26:29.490 --> 01:26:30.790
"How far away are you?

2016
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:34.310
"Are you coming back soon?

2017
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:37.068
"It's been very busy...

2018
01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:44.702
"Giants! That's impressive! I'm proud of you."

2019
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.855
LAURA: I send another one back.

2020
01:26:49.855 --> 01:26:52.030
Busy? Busy how? Yes, really far away.

2021
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:53.660
I'm in Xhorhas, but don't worry,

2022
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.017
everything's okay. I'm okay.

2023
01:26:56.017 --> 01:26:57.967
They think we're heroes, but don't worry I still--

2024
01:26:57.967 --> 01:26:58.800
TRAVIS: Shh!

2025
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.384
(laughter)

2026
01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:02.217
SAM: Shh!

2027
01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:07.720
MATT: "The Gold Chain Mercenary Company

2028
01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.320
"has come through recently to help with the war,

2029
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.753
"and a lot of

2030
01:27:12.753 --> 01:27:15.703
patrons means I'm busy.

2031
01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:20.777
"But I'm proud of you, my little sapphire."

2032
01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:22.660
LAURA: Ooh!

2033
01:27:24.855 --> 01:27:26.688
Okay, that was better.

2034
01:27:26.688 --> 01:27:28.570
All right, I'm going to go to sleep now.

2035
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:32.590
I'm going to hold my necklace as I fall asleep.

2036
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:35.040
TALIESIN: I'm going to if I can, well,

2037
01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:38.424
do I have--yeah. I'm going to cast

2038
01:27:38.424 --> 01:27:39.560
one last spell before I go to sleep.

2039
01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.570
MATT: What are you going to cast?

2040
01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:42.157
TALIESIN: Commune.

2041
01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:43.116
MATT: Okay.

2042
01:27:43.116 --> 01:27:44.215
TRAVIS: Ooh.

2043
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.482
LAURA: The Gold Chain Mercenaries.

2044
01:27:47.482 --> 01:27:51.410
MATT: All righty. Pulling out

2045
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:56.410
little more of your incense, bit of holy water,

2046
01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.330
it's water actually pulled from the pond.

2047
01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:03.790
You have quite a collection of it you took before you left,

2048
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:05.350
just to ensure.

2049
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:07.000
You take a bit of it and spritz it on the incense

2050
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.970
which causes the steam to rise

2051
01:28:08.970 --> 01:28:10.190
and the smell reaches your nose.

2052
01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:13.460
You concentrate and as the warmth

2053
01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.150
of the chamber fades, temperature

2054
01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:17.958
seems to have no impact

2055
01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:21.116
in this dark moment

2056
01:28:21.116 --> 01:28:23.912
before it looks like a sunrise

2057
01:28:23.912 --> 01:28:26.480
rises out of the darkness and that color

2058
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.070
and warmth embraces you.

2059
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:31.790
On that light, on that gold and reds

2060
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:35.220
and oranges begin to fade to a blue and green

2061
01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:39.672
spectrum of morning colors, you can see the light

2062
01:28:39.672 --> 01:28:43.190
gently topple down into strands

2063
01:28:43.190 --> 01:28:45.720
of hair that seem to lift and drift.

2064
01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.929
You can barely make out

2065
01:28:47.929 --> 01:28:50.220
the essence of a face, a matronly

2066
01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:53.240
woman's face, the eyes just opening

2067
01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.530
like two small stars towards you with a smile.

2068
01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:59.008
Lips not moving, but you hear the familiar

2069
01:28:59.008 --> 01:29:03.003
voice fill your soul.

2070
01:29:03.003 --> 01:29:04.453
"Hello."

2071
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:07.853
TALIESIN: Hello.

2072
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:12.422
Is the Overcrow within the city?

2073
01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.540
MATT: "It is nearby, yes."

2074
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:31.140
TALIESIN: Does this threaten the people of this city?

2075
01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:38.790
MATT: She seems unclear

2076
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:41.080
of the question being asked.

2077
01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.410
TALIESIN: Does the King That Crawls

2078
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:47.860
threaten the people of this city?

2079
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:55.820
MATT: "The King That Crawls is far beyond any of us.

2080
01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.707
"He is of no threat to the people of this city."

2081
01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:09.002
TALIESIN: This might be a lot

2082
01:30:09.002 --> 01:30:10.930
and I understand if it's vague.

2083
01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:16.070
Why did they stop expanding the city?

2084
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:18.028
Why build the wall?

2085
01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:27.662
MATT: "They expand. As needed.

2086
01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:33.359
"But they expand into lands treacherous,

2087
01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:36.650
"some mind is paid."

2088
01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:42.312
TALIESIN: I will continue to walk your path.

2089
01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.688
MATT: "Rest well, my Clay,"

2090
01:30:47.688 --> 01:30:48.990
and the sun sets.

2091
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:51.690
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome!

2092
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:54.593
LIAM: I had one minor bit of--
LAURA: So smart!

2093
01:30:54.593 --> 01:30:57.009
LIAM: Caleb stayed in the common area

2094
01:30:57.009 --> 01:31:00.221
just looking through notes and over the books

2095
01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:02.450
that he's collected. Once everyone

2096
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:06.500
has gone to bed, he travels up to the second floor,

2097
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:10.130
and looks at the different doors

2098
01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:12.600
that his companions are staying in

2099
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.000
and hangs for a moment.

2100
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.953
And pauses on the door that Yasha is sleeping in,

2101
01:31:19.353 --> 01:31:24.203
and then over to the one that Nott and Yeza are in.

2102
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.780
He's got his luck stone in his hand

2103
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.846
and he's just sort of twisting it

2104
01:31:30.846 --> 01:31:33.587
and not as long as before, but maybe for a minute,

2105
01:31:33.587 --> 01:31:35.353
just stares at that door.

2106
01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:42.220
Then goes to his room and takes out the silver

2107
01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:45.940
thread and methodically starts surrounding

2108
01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:48.110
the room while Frumpkin bothers Fjord

2109
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:49.730
and he gets ready for bed.

2110
01:31:49.730 --> 01:31:51.380
MATT: All right.

2111
01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.760
Everyone else just going to find an evening's rest?

2112
01:31:57.902 --> 01:31:59.970
SAM: I still got two rhino sex potions.

2113
01:32:01.086 --> 01:32:04.150
(laughter)

2114
01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:06.680
TALIESIN: Roll with advantage.

2115
01:32:09.614 --> 01:32:11.292
SAM: Probably pop those.

2116
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.320
One for each partner.

2117
01:32:15.581 --> 01:32:18.104
LIAM: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: We're going to have a post--

2118
01:32:18.104 --> 01:32:20.152
TRAVIS: We don't always have to have a love--

2119
01:32:20.152 --> 01:32:20.985
LAURA: Can we--

2120
01:32:20.985 --> 01:32:22.434
TALIESIN: We're not getting our deposit back.

2121
01:32:22.434 --> 01:32:24.149
MATT: Okay?
LAURA: Can we get some narration?

2122
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:26.487
LIAM: Didn't we establish these were placebo?

2123
01:32:26.487 --> 01:32:27.841
SAM: Placebo works.

2124
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:32.535
MATT: So wait, do you wake Yeza up?

2125
01:32:32.535 --> 01:32:34.180
SAM: You know what? I'll just cuddle

2126
01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.513
in next to him. If he--you can roll for it--

2127
01:32:36.513 --> 01:32:41.210
if he wakes up naturally, well, we'll see what happens.

2128
01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:43.725
If he seems like he's asleep, that's fine.

2129
01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:45.951
MATT: You're pretty stealthy. Are you trying to be stealthy?

2130
01:32:45.951 --> 01:32:49.157
SAM: No, I just plop down on the bed hard.

2131
01:32:50.853 --> 01:32:54.584
LIAM: Do you slip him the digit? (Matt shushes)

2132
01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.944
SAM: I did it with a razor sharp claw.

2133
01:32:58.944 --> 01:33:01.527
(groaning)

2134
01:33:02.397 --> 01:33:03.540
LAURA: I feel so uncomfortable.

2135
01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:05.590
This is a whole new level.

2136
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:07.950
MATT: He doesn't awaken, but he seems

2137
01:33:09.168 --> 01:33:12.680
to just rustle around a minute

2138
01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.280
and then pull the blanket close.

2139
01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.320
SAM: I'll just spoon him.

2140
01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.153
MATT: Okay.

2141
01:33:19.711 --> 01:33:21.066
(Matt laughs)

2142
01:33:21.066 --> 01:33:22.980
SAM: That's all.
MATT: All righty.

2143
01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:25.325
An evening's rest.

2144
01:33:26.217 --> 01:33:29.118
Fjord, you going to do something weird?

2145
01:33:29.118 --> 01:33:30.437
TALIESIN: That was weird.

2146
01:33:30.437 --> 01:33:31.270
TRAVIS: Just sleeping.

2147
01:33:32.592 --> 01:33:34.450
TRAVIS: Somebody's got to keep the standards--

2148
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:35.750
MATT: There you go.

2149
01:33:36.787 --> 01:33:38.870
All right, so each of you

2150
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:41.560
get to sleep. Some of you pretty quickly,

2151
01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.680
but by the time that Caleb gets to rest,

2152
01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.050
and probably you, Nott,

2153
01:33:46.050 --> 01:33:49.502
and actually probably you as well, Caduceus.

2154
01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:56.020
You begin to sense maybe it should be sunrise

2155
01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:57.560
right about now, but it's just weird

2156
01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.960
to be in that space where there is no sunrise.

2157
01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.456
Before you drift off to sleep.

2158
01:34:02.456 --> 01:34:03.747
TALIESIN: Like Anchorage weird.

2159
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.563
LIAM: Yeah, it's weird.

2160
01:34:07.563 --> 01:34:09.170
TALIESIN: I like it, but it's weird.

2161
01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:10.370
I really like it, though.

2162
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:12.303
MATT: Fjord.

2163
01:34:13.565 --> 01:34:16.035
(groaning)

2164
01:34:16.035 --> 01:34:19.599
TRAVIS: Shit, it's going to be weird.

2165
01:34:19.599 --> 01:34:21.708
LAURA: Fjord's getting a dream

2166
01:34:21.708 --> 01:34:23.454
while Nott's thinking about boning Yeza.

2167
01:34:23.454 --> 01:34:26.363
SAM: Am I in the wrong bed? This isn't Yeza.

2168
01:34:26.363 --> 01:34:30.513
TRAVIS: In my dream, I just heard (thudding).

2169
01:34:32.414 --> 01:34:34.434
MARISHA: Hotel rules.

2170
01:34:34.434 --> 01:34:36.480
MATT: The sound of the rain

2171
01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.250
gently lulls you to sleep.

2172
01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:41.760
You can hear the water colliding against the wood

2173
01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.310
on the outside of your chamber.

2174
01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:47.020
As you come to sleep,

2175
01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:50.483
you can feel the rain on your skin.

2176
01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:56.240
You feel the water rise above your ankles

2177
01:34:57.610 --> 01:34:58.960
to your knee,

2178
01:35:01.716 --> 01:35:03.070
to your torso and it is freezing cold.

2179
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:05.670
As soon as it hits the torso, your chest

2180
01:35:05.670 --> 01:35:07.780
seizes for a moment and you

2181
01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:09.080
have to catch your breath.

2182
01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:12.370
It rises higher and higher

2183
01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:14.550
until you're fighting to catch

2184
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:16.947
your last breath of oxygen and inhale,

2185
01:35:16.947 --> 01:35:21.947
before the water level escapes and continues up

2186
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:24.200
into the lightless darkness.

2187
01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.570
You swear you see something move in the water,

2188
01:35:30.570 --> 01:35:31.810
and you glance to try and catch it

2189
01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:33.230
and you don't see it.

2190
01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:35.110
Something shifts this way and you look

2191
01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:38.210
you try and swim but nothing's catching your eyes.

2192
01:35:46.288 --> 01:35:48.317
"Where?"

2193
01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.990
The eye opens up before you, the light

2194
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:55.800
golden and yellow just completely

2195
01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.180
enveloping your body, nude, swimming

2196
01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.480
through the dark water.

2197
01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:07.458
"Reward."

2198
01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.200
You feel this little heartbeat

2199
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.033
in your chest.

2200
01:36:12.033 --> 01:36:14.105
(heartbeat)

2201
01:36:14.105 --> 01:36:15.540
You look down and you can see,

2202
01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:19.650
against the dull gray skin of your chest,

2203
01:36:19.650 --> 01:36:21.820
there is a yellowish light source,

2204
01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:25.028
the same light as the eye before you, pulsing.

2205
01:36:25.028 --> 01:36:29.128
(heartbeat)

2206
01:36:33.235 --> 01:36:36.350
"Punish."

2207
01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.680
There's a searing pain which shoots

2208
01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.010
into your chest and you look down,

2209
01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:43.010
and the space where it's pulsing,

2210
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:44.820
the water just gets clouded with darkness,

2211
01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:46.230
blood beginning to pour through

2212
01:36:46.230 --> 01:36:47.920
and seep from your sternum.

2213
01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.050
You reach and clutch for it,

2214
01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:50.896
but it won't stop bleeding.

2215
01:36:50.896 --> 01:36:52.650
You start coughing and inhaling the water

2216
01:36:52.650 --> 01:36:54.317
and you feel yourself drowning and drowning

2217
01:36:54.317 --> 01:36:56.200
and coughing and coughing.

2218
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:01.670
"Punish."

2219
01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:04.500
In those throes of your body shaking,

2220
01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.820
the light begins to fade and numb

2221
01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.130
and drift as the darkness takes you.

2222
01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:13.510
You wake up coughing in your bed,

2223
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:16.120
seawater, in a familiar display,

2224
01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.700
sputtering out of your mouth onto the edge of your bed.

2225
01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:23.260
And you hear the clatter of metal. (clanging)

2226
01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:30.440
TRAVIS: I reach around in the dark for the sound.

2227
01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.250
MATT: Yeah, your falchion is on the floor.

2228
01:37:35.134 --> 01:37:35.967
LIAM: Are you okay?

2229
01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:40.326
TRAVIS: Yep, nope, sorry, I just uh--

2230
01:37:40.326 --> 01:37:43.208
(coughing)

2231
01:37:43.208 --> 01:37:48.138
- was--yes, sorry. Go back to sleep. Everything's fine.

2232
01:37:53.765 --> 01:37:56.972
MATT: You can still hear the rain outside.

2233
01:37:56.972 --> 01:37:57.820
You have no idea what time it is.

2234
01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.403
TRAVIS: Can I hear Caleb breathing?

2235
01:38:02.136 --> 01:38:04.636
MATT: Make a perception check.

2236
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:08.726
TRAVIS: Nine.

2237
01:38:08.726 --> 01:38:10.271
MATT: You can hear him breathing. It's fine.

2238
01:38:10.271 --> 01:38:12.096
I just wanted to make you roll for it.

2239
01:38:12.096 --> 01:38:13.987
TRAVIS: Does he sound like he's asleep?

2240
01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.360
LIAM: I did not go back to sleep.

2241
01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.400
MATT: He does not?

2242
01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.965
LIAM: No, and I rolled a 27 deception check.

2243
01:38:20.965 --> 01:38:23.710
MATT: He's asleep. Unless you make an insight check.

2244
01:38:23.710 --> 01:38:26.087
Make an insight check, actually.

2245
01:38:26.087 --> 01:38:28.302
LIAM: Beat a 27, my man.

2246
01:38:29.194 --> 01:38:30.027
TRAVIS: Ten.

2247
01:38:30.027 --> 01:38:31.160
MATT: Yeah. He's asleep.

2248
01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.460
TRAVIS: My falchion is not normally

2249
01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.413
just out.

2250
01:38:41.263 --> 01:38:43.843
Can I try and

2251
01:38:43.843 --> 01:38:45.093
bamf it away?

2252
01:38:46.396 --> 01:38:47.971
MATT: You focus on the falchion,

2253
01:38:47.971 --> 01:38:50.990
gripping the handle and close your eyes

2254
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:53.620
to will it away, but it remains.

2255
01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.332
(gasping)

2256
01:38:55.332 --> 01:38:56.665
LAURA: Oh no!

2257
01:39:03.653 --> 01:39:05.035
TRAVIS: Do I have any idea

2258
01:39:05.035 --> 01:39:08.430
what time it is, how long I've been asleep?

2259
01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.950
MATT: You have no idea.

2260
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:13.300
It's eternal nighttime here in Rosohna.

2261
01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.420
You have no idea.

2262
01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:21.465
Just sitting alone in your soaked bedsheets

2263
01:39:21.465 --> 01:39:24.860
clutching your sword, confused in the darkness.

2264
01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:28.295
TRAVIS: I will get up and gather

2265
01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:32.330
shoes and basic armaments and I will try

2266
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:35.430
to quietly exit the room.

2267
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:38.097
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

2268
01:39:39.825 --> 01:39:40.899
TRAVIS: Nine.

2269
01:39:40.899 --> 01:39:43.570
MATT: Okay. You grab your things

2270
01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:46.320
and shuffle and stumble into a chair,

2271
01:39:48.294 --> 01:39:52.619
grab your bag and, as you step,

2272
01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:55.842
does he set off your Alarm spell?

2273
01:39:55.842 --> 01:39:56.994
LIAM: No.

2274
01:39:56.994 --> 01:39:58.588
MATT: Because he was considered an ally, so.

2275
01:39:58.588 --> 01:39:59.847
LIAM: Frumpkin and I watch him go, though.

2276
01:39:59.847 --> 01:40:02.905
MATT: Okay, you watch as Fjord steps out of the chamber.

2277
01:40:02.905 --> 01:40:04.624
(door creaking)

2278
01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:07.080
You think it's closed and you push it and goes (thump)

2279
01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:07.936
like, "Shit!"

2280
01:40:07.936 --> 01:40:10.494
TRAVIS: Fuck! (clears throat)

2281
01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.950
Is there more light in the hallway?

2282
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:17.985
MATT: There is. There are three low-burning

2283
01:40:17.985 --> 01:40:20.450
oil lanterns that are fixed to the wall.

2284
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:22.770
TRAVIS: Can I walk over underneath one of the lanterns

2285
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:25.180
and look at the falchion? Does it look

2286
01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:27.340
the same, different? Is the eye still there?

2287
01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.270
MATT: It looks the same the eye's still there, yeah.

2288
01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:32.940
TRAVIS: Is there anyone in the hallway?

2289
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.170
MATT: Right now, no, not at this hour.

2290
01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:36.390
TRAVIS: Can I conjure up a ball

2291
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:40.185
of eldritch energy in my hand and see what the eye does?

2292
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:44.798
MATT: You look down at your palm.

2293
01:40:44.798 --> 01:40:46.291
Nothing emerges.

2294
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:48.791
(gasping)

2295
01:40:50.439 --> 01:40:53.680
You concentrate and focus and all you can see

2296
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.400
after a minute of trying is the sweat

2297
01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:58.408
beginning to form on your palm and your forehead.

2298
01:40:59.408 --> 01:41:01.450
Dripping off your nose.

2299
01:41:02.818 --> 01:41:05.880
TRAVIS: Uh. Uh. Uh.

2300
01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:10.880
I hustle down out of the Dim's Inn

2301
01:41:11.327 --> 01:41:13.818
and into the street.

2302
01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:16.543
Can I find a corner,

2303
01:41:16.543 --> 01:41:19.880
like an alley or just a closed space

2304
01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:20.713
where no one is?

2305
01:41:20.713 --> 01:41:21.729
MATT: Yeah, it takes you a moment

2306
01:41:21.729 --> 01:41:24.200
because you're in this half-fugue state;

2307
01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.910
not concentrating, more stuck internally

2308
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:28.190
in your thought process. You push out

2309
01:41:28.190 --> 01:41:30.600
into the cold rain without even feeling it on you.

2310
01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:32.670
You push off into the nearest alleyway

2311
01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:33.860
to the right, which is similar

2312
01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.630
to where the moorbounders are brought.

2313
01:41:35.630 --> 01:41:37.468
You find one little subsection there.

2314
01:41:37.468 --> 01:41:38.884
TRAVIS: Puddles. Are there puddles? Are there puddles?

2315
01:41:38.884 --> 01:41:39.717
MATT: There are puddles, yes.

2316
01:41:39.717 --> 01:41:41.000
TRAVIS: Can I find a puddle and look

2317
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.650
in the ground and I will use

2318
01:41:42.650 --> 01:41:47.266
Mask of Many Faces to make myself look like Caduceus.

2319
01:41:47.266 --> 01:41:48.674
MATT: Okay. You look down in the water

2320
01:41:48.674 --> 01:41:50.206
and all you see is your face.

2321
01:41:50.206 --> 01:41:51.784
(groaning)

2322
01:41:51.784 --> 01:41:52.617
LIAM: Shit!

2323
01:41:54.158 --> 01:41:55.960
SAM: He's just a guy.

2324
01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:02.380
TRAVIS: (British accent) (repeated) No, no, no.

2325
01:42:07.678 --> 01:42:11.411
Okay, uh, right right right.

2326
01:42:12.994 --> 01:42:15.744
(exhales)

2327
01:42:19.095 --> 01:42:22.370
(nervous humming)

2328
01:42:25.165 --> 01:42:28.540
(panicked breathing)

2329
01:42:30.574 --> 01:42:32.115
Fuck!

2330
01:42:37.706 --> 01:42:41.173
It's all right. It's fine. It's fine.

2331
01:42:47.690 --> 01:42:52.610
I will take the sword back inside

2332
01:42:55.343 --> 01:42:59.402
and walk back up to my room,

2333
01:43:02.299 --> 01:43:07.200
and try and quietly go back to sleep.

2334
01:43:08.076 --> 01:43:10.434
MATT: Okay. You hear Fjord step back in,

2335
01:43:10.434 --> 01:43:14.430
breathing heavily, crawl back into his bed,

2336
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:15.838
and lay down.

2337
01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:21.570
Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw for me.

2338
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:30.690
TRAVIS: 21.

2339
01:43:30.690 --> 01:43:32.950
MATT: Okay, amongst the adrenaline

2340
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:34.600
pouring through your veins,

2341
01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.750
the thoughts rushing through your mind,

2342
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.780
you force yourself to find a center

2343
01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:42.570
of peace on the inside of your consciousness

2344
01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:45.530
and do manage to find sleep once more

2345
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:47.770
after about 30 or so minutes of silently

2346
01:43:47.770 --> 01:43:50.345
panicking in your bed.

2347
01:43:52.630 --> 01:43:57.040
Eventually you all begin to rouse from your slumber,

2348
01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.645
and we'll return there after our break.

2349
01:44:00.645 --> 01:44:02.701
SAM: Oh, Matthew Mercer.

2350
01:44:02.701 --> 01:44:04.116
LAURA: Oh shit!

2351
01:44:04.116 --> 01:44:06.066
LIAM: That was dope as fuck.

2352
01:44:06.924 --> 01:44:09.890
LAURA: Oh no, Travis! You have no powers, oh no!

2353
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:12.315

2357
01:44:19.173 --> 01:44:21.465
TRAVIS: No! Squib!

01:44:21.465 --> 01:44:23.035
LAURA: Squib!
SAM: Oh no!

2359
01:44:23.035 --> 01:44:24.230
MATT: Before we go to our break,

2360
01:44:24.230 --> 01:44:26.273
we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway

2361
01:44:26.273 --> 01:44:27.110

2365
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:36.400
skin texture leather inside there.

2366
01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.166

[high-pitched note]
[thudding footsteps]

2395
01:45:52.050 --> 01:45:54.400
BINWIN: Hi I'm Binwin Bronzebottom, celebrity dwarf

2396
01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.680
and video game enthusiast and this is my sidekick,

2397
01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:57.700
Crowy.
CROWY: Hello!

2398
01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.630
BINWIN: We're here to tell you about Idle Champions

2399
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:01.606
of the Forgotten Realms, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons

2400
01:46:01.606 --> 01:46:04.473
based strategy management game from Codename Entertainment.

2401
01:46:04.473 --> 01:46:06.870
They're Canadian so you know it's good.

2402
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:08.050
CROWY: Let's talk about the game.

2403
01:46:08.050 --> 01:46:09.370
Did you ever play cookie clicker?

2404
01:46:09.370 --> 01:46:10.220
BINWIN: Of course not.

2405
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.890
CROWY: This game is a management game like that,

2406
01:46:11.890 --> 01:46:13.456
but with far more emphasis on strategy

2407
01:46:13.456 --> 01:46:15.390
and with a flavoring of D&amp;D's lore

2408
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:16.780
and legendary heroes you can unlock

2409
01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:18.820
your favorite champions like Drizzt Do'Urden

2410
01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.970
from R.A Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels,

2411
01:46:20.970 --> 01:46:23.560
Holly Conrad's Stryx from Dice Camera Action,

2412
01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.330
or as Chris Perkins' kobold, Spurt, from Critical Role.

2413
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:27.450
He died.

2414
01:46:27.450 --> 01:46:29.280
BINWIN: How do you like it, Perkins?

2415
01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:31.321
CROWY: Create the best adventuring party possible

2416
01:46:31.321 --> 01:46:32.730
based on the formation options,

2417
01:46:32.730 --> 01:46:34.620
your character's ability, and the obstacles

2418
01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:35.490
and enemies you face.

2419
01:46:35.490 --> 01:46:36.620
BINWIN: Or you just randomly click

2420
01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:38.520
on things like I do and hope for the best.

2421
01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:40.340
CROWY: You click on enemies to assist your champions,

2422
01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:41.760
or you can set them up and walk away

2423
01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.010
and let them do their thing, it's entirely up to you.

2424
01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:45.320
BINWIN: I'm playing on the toilet right now!

2425
01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.176
CROWY: Why wouldn't you be? Idle Champions

2426
01:46:47.176 --> 01:46:49.640
is available on all your favorite gaming platforms,

2427
01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.830
including tablets for the low, low price of free.

2428
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:53.780
So download it now!

2429
01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:54.700
BINWIN: End with joke!

2430
01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:55.533
CROWY: You're not supposed to read it.

2431
01:46:55.533 --> 01:46:56.366
BINWIN: It says end with joke.

2432
01:46:56.366 --> 01:46:57.730
CROWY: No, we're supposed to come up with a joke

2433
01:46:57.730 --> 01:46:59.690
to go with where it says end with joke.

2434
01:46:59.690 --> 01:47:01.580
BINWIN: I don't know, "end with joke" is pretty funny.

2435
01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:02.910
CROWY: Wait on three, ready?

2436
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:03.743
BINWIN: Yeah.

2437
01:47:03.743 --> 01:47:04.713
CROWY: One, two, three.

2438
01:47:04.713 --> 01:47:06.410
BINWIN and CROWY: End with joke!

2439
01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:10.780
BRIAN (VO): Last time on Talks Machina.

2440
01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.840
BRIAN: "Fjord seemed more frightened of the snapping

2441
01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.475
"turtle than the undead giant that had just spilled

2442
01:47:14.475 --> 01:47:16.920
"its guts in front of him.

2443
01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:20.060
"What horrible experience with a snapping turtle

2444
01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.210
"did Fjord have during his life as a sailor

2445
01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:24.074
"to create such a phobia?"

2446
01:47:24.074 --> 01:47:27.704

2447
01:47:27.704 --> 01:47:29.240
TRAVIS: Yeah, Fjord ate some moldy-ass bread

2448
01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.137
on a ship one day, fell into,

2449
01:47:32.137 --> 01:47:33.475
(groaning)

2450
01:47:33.475 --> 01:47:35.100
MATT: My wallet, have you seen my wallet anywhere?

2451
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:38.470
ASHLEY: Wait, no, Matt, we can't have any interruptions.

2452
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:40.740
MATT: I missed it. Is this the first part of the episode

2453
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:42.330
I'm trying to--hold on.

2454
01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:43.163
BRIAN: No interruptions.

2455
01:47:43.163 --> 01:47:44.354
MATT: In this area?

2456
01:47:44.354 --> 01:47:48.240
BRIAN: "What went through your mind when we revisited

2457
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.298
'Where do you find your strength?'"

2458
01:47:50.298 --> 01:47:51.900
TRAVIS: I was going to say, in campaign one,

2459
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:54.533
the temple of Kord, right, obviously.

2460
01:47:54.533 --> 01:47:56.970
Earthbreaker Groon was like, you know,

2461
01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:58.560
"Where do you find your strength?"

2462
01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.740
and then proceeded to beat Grog's ass

2463
01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.270
until he figured out what the answer was,

2464
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:04.020
which was great.

2465
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:07.560
In just watching all of that unfold

2466
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.760
and hearing that come out of the Stormlord.

2467
01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.160
DANI: Who is Kord!

2468
01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.230
ASHLEY: I completely forgot about that.

2469
01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:14.400
TRAVIS: Really?

2470
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.932
ASHLEY: Yes. Until after it was over, and I was like,

2471
01:48:16.932 --> 01:48:18.574
"Oh my god!"

2472
01:48:18.574 --> 01:48:19.958
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

2473
01:48:19.958 --> 01:48:24.958
ASHLEY: (brain explosion) Yeah. But I blanked.

2474
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:27.070
You know and then when the moment is done

2475
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:28.050
you're like, "What did I even say,

2476
01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:30.361
"what did I even say?"

2477
01:48:30.361 --> 01:48:32.745
TRAVIS: In the first campaign it was a monk,

2478
01:48:32.745 --> 01:48:34.470
you know, level 20 million badass monk

2479
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:35.740
with Quivering Palm or whatever

2480
01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.450
that asked the question. I mean, obviously

2481
01:48:37.450 --> 01:48:41.070
in the temple of Kord, but the Stormlord

2482
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:46.070
talked to you. Holy shit, what does that mean?!

2483
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:48.140
Who are you to him? What did you do?

2484
01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:49.636
BRIAN: What does it mean?

2485
01:48:49.636 --> 01:48:51.566
ASHLEY: I know! I don't know! What does it mean?

2486
01:48:51.566 --> 01:48:53.480
BRIAN: "How did the conversation with Wursh

2487
01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.460
"the blacksmith impact Fjord's perspective

2488
01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:58.160
"on himself and his self-confidence?"

2489
01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.955
TRAVIS: Fucking Matt's just too good.

2490
01:49:00.955 --> 01:49:02.442
ASHLEY: That was.

2491
01:49:02.442 --> 01:49:04.530
TRAVIS: I was not ready to have that kind

2492
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:06.381
of a conversation and he just kept like--

2493
01:49:07.431 --> 01:49:10.200
you know when you're pissed and you want

2494
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.650
the other person to, like, be pissed

2495
01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:13.570
or respond to you in the same sort

2496
01:49:13.570 --> 01:49:15.720
of heated way and they just respond calmly

2497
01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.770
and they're like, "This is agitating you, isn't it?"

2498
01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:20.399
like "No!"

2499
01:49:20.399 --> 01:49:21.982
ASHLEY: Yeah!

2500
01:49:21.982 --> 01:49:22.932
BRIAN: I'm fine!

2501
01:49:22.932 --> 01:49:24.162
TRAVIS: It was just like that.

2502
01:49:24.162 --> 01:49:26.024
I was like, "I don't want to talk about why I feel

2503
01:49:26.024 --> 01:49:27.670
"this way and yes, people treat me like shit

2504

"and yeah, it gets under my skin.

2505
01:49:29.698 --> 01:49:31.203
"I don't want to say any of that!"

2506
01:49:35.353 --> 01:49:37.710
BRIAN: That is a tough one to answer, isn't it?

2507
01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:41.725
ASHLEY: I think she--
BRIAN: Dude.

2508
01:49:41.725 --> 01:49:43.535
ASHLEY: I think she's kind of just weird.

2509
01:49:43.535 --> 01:49:47.530
There's and I think that's all I can say about that.

2510
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:49.250
BRIAN: Okay.

2511
01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:51.100
ASHLEY: She doesn't quite know what she is.

2512
01:49:52.368 --> 01:49:53.760
BRIAN: "While Pike and Grog were bestest buddies,

2513
01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:56.444

01:50:03.469 --> 01:50:05.440
Well, both of you have played Yasha, that's where.

2518
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:08.630
ASHLEY: That's the common ground, yes.

2519
01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:10.640
BRIAN: Both of you kill as playing Yasha.

2520
01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.010
TRAVIS: I am, just after the last episode,

2521
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:16.640
because Fjord is very interested

2522
01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:19.270
in Caduceus' relationship with the Wildmother

2523
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:22.310
and how the hell that works, Jester and the Traveler,

2524
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:23.810
How the hell that works.

2525
01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.109
I'm sure he'll want to ask

2526
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:28.690
about the thunderstorms that just always

2527
01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:32.513
seem to follow the group when Yasha is around,

2528
01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:35.400
and what that means.

2529
01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:38.950
Fjord's relationship with his thing

2530
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:42.610
is not so <i>bueno</i> and is not a two-way street,

2531
01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:46.640
and he's not super happy with it.

2532
01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.100
So I think he's looking just to connect

2533
01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:51.350
and say like, "Hey, I know we don't know

2534
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:53.780
"much, but I'll tell you some of my terrible

2535
01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:55.182
"stuff if you tell me yours."

2536
01:50:55.182 --> 01:50:56.015
BRIAN: Yeah.

2537
01:50:56.015 --> 01:50:59.360
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to it.

2538
01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:03.390
It's fun seeing what sort of relationships

2539
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:06.836
pop up or, you know,

2540
01:51:06.836 --> 01:51:08.720

2541
01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:10.720
we do not plan anything.

2542
01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.510
It's interesting seeing what pops

2543
01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:14.750
and you're like, "Oh I'm having a conversation

2544
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:17.105
with this person about this thing,"

2545
01:51:18.072 --> 01:51:20.834
Yeah, I'm curious to see what Yasha and Fjord's--

2546
01:51:20.834 --> 01:51:23.485
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Connection will be.

BRIAN: Oh dude, dude.

2620
01:55:40.553 --> 01:55:42.784
TRAVIS: Yeah, keep going, yeah, you got it.

2621
01:55:42.784 --> 01:55:44.290
BRIAN: There's some shiznits here, boom.

2622
01:55:44.290 --> 01:55:45.950
Okay, now where do I want to go, though?

2623
01:55:47.175 --> 01:55:48.730
Oh fuck, can I shoot it through this?

2624
01:55:48.730 --> 01:55:50.817
TRAVIS: Oh, you know what? So here, I'm going to lower

2625
01:55:50.817 --> 01:55:52.237
this back down and can you jump

2626
01:55:52.237 --> 01:55:53.595
back up on that crate?

2627
01:55:53.595 --> 01:55:54.665
BRIAN: Yep.

2628
01:55:54.665 --> 01:55:56.148
TRAVIS: Okay.

2629
01:55:57.273 --> 01:55:59.940
(Travis laughs)

2630
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:08.890
BRIAN: I expect it at some point,

2631
01:56:08.890 --> 01:56:10.000
but this early?

2632
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
TRAVIS and BRIAN: One, two, three.

2633
01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:15.550
TRAVIS: On fucking three, not--

2634
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:16.383
BRIAN: Do it again.

2635
01:56:16.383 --> 01:56:17.990
TRAVIS: On three.

2636
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:19.570
One, two, three.

2637
01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:23.317

01:56:27.826 --> 01:56:29.290
I panicked. I'm doing some gesture.

01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:39.038
Wait, okay, hold on. Hold on, I got an idea.

2644
01:56:39.038 --> 01:56:40.363

BRIAN: Yeah.

2645

BRIAN: Uh-huh.

TRAVIS: One, two, three.

BRIAN: Yes, yes, yes.

(laughter)

2649
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:50.510
TRAVIS: I don't know why I didn't just try

2650
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:51.790
to go through the portal.

2651
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:55.220
I mean, look at you. That is really interesting.

2652
01:56:56.638 --> 01:56:57.471
BRIAN: It's kind of fun.

2653
01:56:57.471 --> 01:56:58.420
TRAVIS: I wish if I'd just stopped,

2654
01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:02.510
I'm going to click this. Three, two, one.

2655
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:04.491
A-go get him.

01:57:04.491 --> 01:57:05.847

01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:12.636

BRIAN: Get in here, Jerry.

2661
01:57:19.634 --> 01:57:21.550
Guys, someone you should know at Critical Role Land

2662
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:25.140
is Jerry, one of our production assistants here.

2663
01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:26.950
TRAVIS: Right, so we're doing this thing.

2664
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:27.880
JERRY: You made one hole there,

2665
01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.090
you made one hole there,

2666
01:57:29.090 --> 01:57:31.530
now you make the hole on the other side.

2667
01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:33.570
One up there, and then one on the other side,

2668
01:57:33.570 --> 01:57:35.610
and then both of you go through it.

2669
01:57:35.610 --> 01:57:37.510
Then both of you jump through it,

2670
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:38.720
and then once you're on the other side

2671
01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:40.440
then you create your own little path.

2672
01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.400
Okay, so now you have to make one hole there.

2673
01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:44.300
BRIAN: One hole there?

2674
01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.560
JERRY: Then one hole in the bottom.

2675
01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.684
BRIAN: I dropped down. I'm at the finish line.

2676
01:57:48.684 --> 01:57:49.950
JERRY: Isn't that--can't you shoot--?

2677
01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:52.532
TRAVIS: No, look, I'll shoot it, you can't.

2678
01:57:53.461 --> 01:57:56.402
BRIAN: Jerry, are you fucking serious?
TRAVIS: Goddamn it, Jerry.

2680
01:57:57.593 --> 01:57:59.374

2681
01:57:59.374 --> 01:58:00.406
TRAVIS: Man!

2682
01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:01.990
OFF-CAMERA: Get out of there, Jerry!

2683

TRAVIS: Jesus.

2684
01:58:03.159 --> 01:58:04.317
BRIAN: I have seen some people

2685
01:58:04.317 --> 01:58:05.800
do some desperate shit to get on

2686

the spotlight from you before, Travis,

2692
01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:20.450
but never in my life in such a ballsy--

2693
01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:21.283
TRAVIS: You know who that was?

2694
01:58:21.283 --> 01:58:26.283
That was a double agent of Balthazar.

2695
01:58:26.604 --> 01:58:27.607
BRIAN: Bast'Alar.

So. What would you like to do?

2717
02:10:24.096 --> 02:10:25.710
LIAM: I think that we should just

2718
02:10:26.731 --> 02:10:29.030
take care of business, <i>ja.</i>

2719
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:30.730
MARISHA: Finish Whacko first.

2720
02:10:30.730 --> 02:10:32.812
Waccoh. We're not saying that right.

2721
02:10:32.812 --> 02:10:34.990
We should not call her Whacko to her face.

2722
02:10:37.273 --> 02:10:38.728
LAURA: Is it just going to be you guys

2723
02:10:38.728 --> 02:10:42.913
going again or are all of us going to see her?

2724
02:10:42.913 --> 02:10:45.619
LIAM: I think she just us. She was sort of

2725
02:10:45.619 --> 02:10:48.558
an odd duck and I don't know that she--

2726
02:10:49.450 --> 02:10:50.880
I think we should just keep it us,

2727
02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:52.470
just a gut instinct.

2728
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:53.940
MARISHA: If a few more would like to join,

2729
02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:55.340
if anyone wanted to talk to her.

2730
02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:56.460
LIAM: I feel like one or two more,

2731
02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:57.750
but not the entire group?

2732
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:59.260
MARISHA: I mean, she knows we're working.

2733
02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:01.450
SAM: She's a tinkerer, right,

2734
02:11:01.450 --> 02:11:03.862
she's not a magician or anything?

2735
02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:06.380
LIAM: No, she deals in the arcane,

2736
02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.049
but she is crafting it towards

2737
02:11:09.049 --> 02:11:11.340
their military and towards destruction.

2738
02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:14.705
MARISHA: It seems to be like a war scientist.

2739
02:11:14.705 --> 02:11:16.640
SAM: A scientist, so if anyone

2740
02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:18.000
has need of science?

2741
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.400
MARISHA: Seems somebody that Yeza

2742
02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:22.349
might actually be able to have like really great

2743
02:11:22.349 --> 02:11:24.060
boring conversation with.

2744
02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:25.280
SAM: Would you like to come meet

2745
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:28.603
a powerful scientist of the Dynasty?

2746
02:11:28.603 --> 02:11:30.943
MATT: "Uh, sure. Is it okay? Would that be all right?"

2747
02:11:30.943 --> 02:11:33.270
SAM: I mean, yes, but did any powerful

2748
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:36.440
Dynasty scientists torture you or anything?

2749
02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:38.398
MATT: "I don't know, it was very dark."

2750
02:11:38.398 --> 02:11:40.106
TALIESIN: It would also be worth

2751
02:11:40.106 --> 02:11:42.970
noting that perhaps one of the conversations

2752
02:11:42.970 --> 02:11:47.801
you're going to have when things turn to the future

2753
02:11:47.801 --> 02:11:50.190
is how dangerous it is to send people

2754
02:11:50.190 --> 02:11:52.650
back across the border. Either

2755
02:11:53.970 --> 02:11:56.060
there's an argument for being checked out

2756
02:11:56.060 --> 02:11:57.947
to be okay and there's an argument

2757
02:11:57.947 --> 02:12:00.070
for knowing too much to leave.

2758
02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.760
SAM: Doesn't sound like this Whacko person

2759
02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:04.970
can give us too many state secrets, right?

2760
02:12:05.950 --> 02:12:08.810
Or no? Well, let's just go.

2761
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:10.415
LIAM: This was the first test

2762
02:12:10.415 --> 02:12:12.098
that we had in this city.

2763
02:12:12.098 --> 02:12:15.460
LAURA: She was, what, she's an ogre or an orc?

2764
02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:17.160
MARISHA: She's a female orc.

2765
02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:19.350
She was pretty cool. She had, like, crazy

2766
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:21.230
wiry hair, glasses.

2767
02:12:21.230 --> 02:12:23.820
LAURA: How did she feel about, you know,

2768
02:12:25.068 --> 02:12:27.298
how did she feel about you guys as humans?

2769
02:12:27.298 --> 02:12:31.070
MARISHA: Well, she definitely gave us the look down.

2770
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:32.920
LAURA: You think coming in with two

2771
02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.860
humans and a halfling would be better

2772
02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:36.220
than going in with two humans

2773
02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:39.020
and maybe like a half-orc, like Fjord?

2774
02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:40.220
SAM: Maybe Fjord should come

2775
02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:41.950
because he's got that orc thing going

2776
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:43.350
he could speak her language.

2777
02:12:44.410 --> 02:12:46.280
MATT: Which Fjord, you guys have been having

2778
02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.360
this conversation while Fjord has slept in a little bit.

2779
02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.509
As Fjord did not get as much sleep as everyone else.

2780
02:12:50.509 --> 02:12:53.047
You come to consciousnesses, you are alone in the room.

TRAVIS: I'm alone in the room?
MATT: Yeah.

2782
02:12:55.890 --> 02:12:57.900
They've all seemed to congregated downstairs.

2783

2786
02:13:08.051 --> 02:13:11.100

02:13:11.933 --> 02:13:14.120
TRAVIS: Can I slide the sword under the mattress?

2789
02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:15.545
MATT: Sure.

2790
02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:18.272
Slip it under.

2791
02:13:18.272 --> 02:13:20.680
TRAVIS: Is there like a--can you see?

2792
02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.060
MATT: The mattress is fairly lumpy anyway,

2793
02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:26.230
it doesn't seem to be extremely noticeable.

2794
02:13:26.230 --> 02:13:28.790
TRAVIS: Solid frame to the mattress?

2795
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:33.360
MATT: No, it's a cushion mattress.

2796
02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:35.190
Not the most comfortable. There's a frame

2797
02:13:35.190 --> 02:13:38.422
to the bed, but it's not Tempurpedic.

2798
02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:42.400
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll exit the room,

2799
02:13:43.326 --> 02:13:45.090
and on the way down, before I see the group,

2800
02:13:45.090 --> 02:13:47.170
can I just see someone that works there

2801
02:13:47.170 --> 02:13:50.070
or the tavern keep or someone that works?

2802
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:51.400
MATT: Yeah, you see one of the various

2803
02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:53.330
inn hands come by some of the folks

2804
02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:56.426
that normally serves food.
TRAVIS: Hey!

2805
02:13:56.426 --> 02:13:59.260
Do not--do not service our room,

2806
02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:01.340
I don't want anybody fucking going in

2807
02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:03.430
where we stay, is that clear?

2808
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:05.350
MATT: "That's very clear."
TRAVIS: Repeat it back to me.

2809
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:07.520
MATT: "You do not want any fucking anyone

2810
02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:10.710
"to be in your fucking room to clean it, yes?"

2811
02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:12.720
TRAVIS: That's right, and I give him a silver.

2812
02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:14.130
MATT: "Thank you."

2813
02:14:14.130 --> 02:14:15.458
TRAVIS: Get out of here.

2814
02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:17.658
MATT: Darts off.

2815
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:21.775
TRAVIS: How do?

2816
02:14:21.775 --> 02:14:23.534
SAM: Fjord, we were just talking about going to see an orc.

2817
02:14:23.534 --> 02:14:24.631
TRAVIS: Oh good, sorry.

2818
02:14:24.631 --> 02:14:28.300
MARISHA: Hey, Sleeping Beauty, you look like shit.

2819
02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:31.550
Speaking of, who wrote dicks in this page of my journal?

2820
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:33.239
LAURA: Yeah.

2821
02:14:33.239 --> 02:14:34.456
MARISHA: Damn it.

2822
02:14:34.456 --> 02:14:36.672
TALIESIN: That a real question?

2823
02:14:36.672 --> 02:14:38.500
MARISHA: There are dicks in my journal

2824
02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:39.750
that I did not draw.

2825
02:14:41.584 --> 02:14:43.417
It is a genuine thing that happened

2826
02:14:43.417 --> 02:14:46.830
both in real life and in the game.

2827
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:50.207
TRAVIS: It's a question and yet not a question at all.

2828
02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:54.540
SAM: Why don't you two go to Waccoh,

2829
02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.610
we'll bring Fjord for the orc of it all,

2830
02:14:56.610 --> 02:14:58.810
we'll bring Yeza for the science of it all,

2831
02:14:58.810 --> 02:15:01.808
and then I'll come for the Yeza of it all.

2832
02:15:01.808 --> 02:15:03.360
MATT: "Okay, so am I staying in the room, then?"

2833
02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:04.302
SAM: No, no, come.

2834
02:15:04.302 --> 02:15:06.790
MATT: "Okay."
TRAVIS: I don't need to go.

2835
02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:08.950
LAURA: Yeah, you do, but here's the thing,

2836
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:11.470
yeah, like, I don't know I mean, no offense

2837
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:13.100
you guys you're really cool,

2838
02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:15.620
but I'm afraid that she might

2839
02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:17.810
look you know because it's two humans

2840
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:19.700
and a halfling like it'd probably

2841
02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:21.314
be better if somebody you know

2842
02:15:21.314 --> 02:15:23.700
that wasn't human or a halfling went.

2843
02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:24.940
SAM: We have a half-orc.

2844
02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:26.070
LAURA: Yeah that's what I'm saying.

2845
02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:27.569
SAM: And me!

2846
02:15:27.569 --> 02:15:29.488
LAURA: I know and you you're really--

2847
02:15:29.488 --> 02:15:31.130
MARISHA: I mean, she already gave us the job.

2848
02:15:31.130 --> 02:15:32.450
TRAVIS: Devil's advocate.

2849
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:34.360
LIAM: Continuing something that has already begun,

2850
02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:36.417
I feel like we made a good start of it.

2851
02:15:36.417 --> 02:15:37.967
MARISHA: Yeah I feel like we're pretty cool

2852
02:15:37.967 --> 02:15:39.320
and we killed the giants.

2853
02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:40.220
LIAM: We've done what was asked.

2854
02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:41.310
TRAVIS: Yeah I mean, no reason

2855
02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:43.820
to bring new partners into a transaction

2856
02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.470
that they clearly handled very well.

2857
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:46.730
LIAM: That is what I was saying.

2858
02:15:46.730 --> 02:15:48.350
SAM: You don't want to go.

2859
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:49.470
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm fine to go,

2860
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:50.880
I just I think they've got this.

2861
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.480
MARISHA: I was just offering if anyone

2862
02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:54.238
wanted to meet her 'cause I thought she was kind of cool.

2863
02:15:54.238 --> 02:15:55.480
SAM: I want to go.

2864
02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:00.037
MATT: Okay. Yeah all right, wherever--Nott--

2865
02:16:00.037 --> 02:16:01.403
should I call you Nott?

2866
02:16:01.403 --> 02:16:03.240
SAM: No. It seems weird coming from you.

2867
02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:04.215
They can call me Nott.

2868
02:16:04.215 --> 02:16:05.406
MATT: "I agree."

2869
02:16:05.406 --> 02:16:07.010
LIAM: Veth, Yeza, the four of us,

2870
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:09.074
I don't want it to be too big I don't want to--

2871
02:16:09.074 --> 02:16:10.644
LAURA: How many of those cookies do you have?

2872
02:16:10.644 --> 02:16:11.635
MARISHA: Do you want some?

2873
02:16:11.635 --> 02:16:12.706
LAURA: I want one.

2874
02:16:12.706 --> 02:16:13.989
SAM: He's RP'ing right now.

2875
02:16:13.989 --> 02:16:15.672
LIAM: No it's fine, share your cookies.

2876
02:16:15.672 --> 02:16:16.939
I just don't want to spook her

2877
02:16:16.939 --> 02:16:18.966
because I am trying to accomplish more than one thing.

2878
02:16:18.966 --> 02:16:20.060
We are going to collect,

2879
02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:21.980
we also need to decide, I think we're agreed,

2880
02:16:21.980 --> 02:16:25.450
we are not taking the coin--the jewels--

2881
02:16:25.450 --> 02:16:29.150
we are going for these items that she has.

2882
02:16:29.150 --> 02:16:31.680
MARISHA: That's right, it was either

2883
02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:35.510
8,600 GP worth of gems,

2884
02:16:35.510 --> 02:16:38.375
which could give us some dope tattoos

2885
02:16:38.375 --> 02:16:40.260
once we see Orly again, right?

2886
02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:44.793
LAURA: We need like 25 hundred dollars worth of gem dust.

2887
02:16:44.793 --> 02:16:45.785
LIAM: What is a dollar?

2888
02:16:45.785 --> 02:16:47.968
SAM: That would be three tattoos.

2889
02:16:47.968 --> 02:16:49.625
MARISHA: Yeah, we could get three tattoos.

2890
02:16:49.625 --> 02:16:53.363
LAURA: I think it was 25 hundred gold's worth of gem dust.

2891
02:16:53.363 --> 02:16:55.570
LIAM: Or she had a staff that maybe

2892
02:16:55.570 --> 02:16:57.563
could work for anyone but I think

2893
02:16:57.563 --> 02:16:59.813
is perfect for Caduceus, a staff of withering.

2894
02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:04.150
She had a cloak--what did that cloak do again?

2895
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:06.340
It was a robe right?

2896
02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:11.120
MATT: Yeah, there was a robe that when opened

2897
02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.270
it had the ability to apparently

2898
02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:17.720
possibly frighten and throw off an attacker.

2899
02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:19.490
LIAM: Okay, so a scary robe,

2900
02:17:19.490 --> 02:17:21.870
and then there is a ring of evasion,

2901
02:17:21.870 --> 02:17:24.070
which would be good for Yasha or myself

2902
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:26.788
because I could be knocked down by a rabbit.

2903
02:17:28.310 --> 02:17:31.361
LAURA: That would be good for anyone really.

2904
02:17:31.361 --> 02:17:34.450
MARISHA: I really feel like Caduceus

2905
02:17:34.450 --> 02:17:36.200
was our MVP this trip.

2906
02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:39.302
LIAM: That is true.

2907
02:17:39.302 --> 02:17:40.802
TALIESIN: That's nice.

2908
02:17:40.802 --> 02:17:42.792
MARISHA: I will say so I'll put my vote

2909
02:17:42.792 --> 02:17:44.790
if we want to go with one of the items,

2910
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:46.300
I think you did a good job, man.

2911
02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:47.780
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'll also say

2912
02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:50.510
I always think craftsmanship is worth more

2913
02:17:50.510 --> 02:17:52.800
in the end than just raw material.

2914
02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:53.840
Gems will come and go.

2915
02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:56.820
LIAM: We instantly thought of you when we met her.

2916
02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:59.250
TALIESIN: I think this might be--

2917
02:17:59.250 --> 02:18:01.880
Things are getting tougher so maybe it's time

2918
02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:03.200
to toughen up a bit.

2919
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.560
MARISHA: I'm also not against gems

2920
02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:05.880
I just want that to be known.

2921
02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.344
ASHLEY: Is the staff worth the same amount as the gems?

2922
02:18:08.344 --> 02:18:11.340
because maybe you can ask her for a couple

2923
02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:14.380
more things that would be equivalent to the price.

2924
02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:17.380
LAURA: I bet the staff is worth a lot of money.

2925
02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:19.267
LIAM: We could make this simple.

2926
02:18:19.267 --> 02:18:23.417
Show of hands, who wants the items over the coins?

2927
02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:27.425
LAURA: Wait, who wants the items or the gems?

2928
02:18:27.425 --> 02:18:29.700
SAM: Over the gems.

2929
02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:30.920
LIAM: Hands up for items.

2930
02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:33.400
LAURA: I want Caduceus to have a staff.

2931
02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:35.180
TALIESIN: Items are always better.

2932
02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:36.630
LIAM: All right, so we are agreed.

2933
02:18:36.630 --> 02:18:38.652
SAM: I like shiny gems.

2934
02:18:38.652 --> 02:18:40.100
MARISHA: Let's see if we can get some more gems though,

2935
02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:42.510
maybe we can get some gems as like a tip.

2936
02:18:42.510 --> 02:18:44.102
LAURA: Yeah bring somebody with you

2937
02:18:44.102 --> 02:18:45.627
who's really good at talking people into things.

2938
02:18:45.627 --> 02:18:47.660
LIAM: I mean, we really humiliated that person,

2939
02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:51.320
I'm pretty good at talking when I'm on my game.

2940
02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:55.352
MARISHA: Yeah, we weren't really on our game

2941
02:18:55.352 --> 02:18:56.862
last time, but we did okay.

2942
02:18:56.862 --> 02:18:58.129
SAM: Let's go.

2943
02:19:00.430 --> 02:19:05.163
MATT: All right, so. We have these three

2944
02:19:05.163 --> 02:19:10.163
and Yeza going to the Marble Tomes Conservatory,

2945
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:11.530
what are the rest of you doing?

2946
02:19:17.122 --> 02:19:18.962
ASHLEY: I wonder if I could, I mean, you guys

2947
02:19:18.962 --> 02:19:21.480
do not have to go but I would like to maybe see

2948
02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:25.660
if I can buy some bracers or something

2949
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:28.430
to make myself a little bit tougher on the outside.

2950
02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:30.070
LAURA: Yeah we can go see if we can find

2951
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:32.220
like a cool store or something.

2952
02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:33.380
ASHLEY: I don't love shopping

2953
02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:38.380
but I'm nervous to wait to see if I find something

2954
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:41.220
somewhere and maybe die in the process.

2955
02:19:45.133 --> 02:19:47.032
TALIESIN: Do you have anything
you need doing?

2956
02:19:47.032 --> 02:19:48.440
Otherwise I was just thinking

2957
02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:50.181
about maybe having a look around,

2958
02:19:50.181 --> 02:19:51.753
maybe figuring out a gentle way to see

2959
02:19:51.753 --> 02:19:54.088
if this--what was this,

2960
02:19:54.088 --> 02:19:59.088
Overcrow thing or not.

2961
02:19:59.336 --> 02:20:01.990
LAURA: Oh yeah, we should find the Overcrow.

2962
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:04.199
ASHLEY: We could look around for that.

2963
02:20:04.199 --> 02:20:05.502
TALIESIN: We could do both.

2964
02:20:05.502 --> 02:20:08.507
LAURA: Let's just roam around and see what we see.

2965
02:20:09.465 --> 02:20:12.180
ASHLEY: Let's sight see in where we are right now.

2966
02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:13.697
TRAVIS: Do you want to meet up

2967
02:20:13.697 --> 02:20:15.261
or do you want to take two different--?

2968
02:20:15.261 --> 02:20:17.381
ASHLEY: I would also like to see if we

2969
02:20:17.381 --> 02:20:20.640
could find the Overcrow.

2970
02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:21.957
LAURA: Yeah let's wander out

2971
02:20:21.957 --> 02:20:24.452
to find the Overcrow and look for stores on the way.

2972
02:20:24.452 --> 02:20:25.668
LIAM: You are going to go shopping?

2973
02:20:25.668 --> 02:20:27.376
TALIESIN: We'll meet back up for lunch.

2974
02:20:27.376 --> 02:20:28.986
LIAM: I write a little laundry list

2975
02:20:28.986 --> 02:20:30.470
out for Yasha specifically.

2976
02:20:31.442 --> 02:20:33.117
I'm going to write that now and text it to you.

2977
02:20:33.117 --> 02:20:34.157
ASHLEY: Okay.

2978
02:20:34.157 --> 02:20:34.990
MATT: Okay.

2979
02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:38.450
LAURA: Paper, paper, ink, paper.

2980
02:20:40.470 --> 02:20:41.873
MATT: The four of you, including Yeza--

2981
02:20:41.873 --> 02:20:45.081
LIAM: I went to text her and I went Y-A-S-H.

2982
02:20:45.081 --> 02:20:47.950
(laughter)

2983
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:49.906
I was like, why isn't it coming up?

2984
02:20:49.906 --> 02:20:52.700
MATT: That's pretty funny.

2985
02:20:52.700 --> 02:20:54.470
We've gone too deep guys.

2986
02:20:54.470 --> 02:20:56.470
We've made Mazes &amp; Monsters-ed this.

2987
02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:01.289
The three of you plus Yeza make your way

2988
02:21:01.289 --> 02:21:04.326
from the Gallimaufry to the Firmaments

2989
02:21:04.326 --> 02:21:07.450
to the Marble Tomes Conservatory.

2990
02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:10.877
Upon stepping in--and Nott and Yeza,

2991
02:21:10.877 --> 02:21:13.630
both are you and your husband are kind of

2992
02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:15.570
taken aback by the structure.

2993
02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:18.480
It's beautiful, it's elegant and ominous

2994
02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:19.570
at the same time.

2995
02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:26.410
It's still strange to have it still dark

2996
02:21:26.610 --> 02:21:28.590
even though it feels like it's morning.

2997
02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:30.920
The glowing green lantern light

2998
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:32.651
and the bits of flickering internal

2999
02:21:32.651 --> 02:21:35.940
firelight that shimmies through

3000
02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:40.490
some of the windows--it's a beautiful display.

3001
02:21:40.490 --> 02:21:42.620
They take point, and as you approach, the guards

3002
02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:45.150
walk forward--the Aurora watch that are guarding,

3003
02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:47.840
seem initially flustered by the arrival

3004
02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:49.550
of these strange humans but one of the guards

3005
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:51.250
puts up a hand to the others,

3006
02:21:51.250 --> 02:21:53.280
"I recognize them it's okay.

3007
02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:58.860
"Have you returned to talk to the professor?"

3008
02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:03.090
MARISHA: We have. We've returned quite victorious.

3009
02:22:03.090 --> 02:22:05.440
MATT: "And you bring with you--?"

3010
02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:07.600
MARISHA: Our compatriots

3011
02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:12.566
and aids in the bite--fight against the big biting giants.

3012
02:22:13.575 --> 02:22:16.640
LAURA: I thought you were--(cooing)

3013
02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:18.890
MATT: "And the halfling is part of this how?"

3014
02:22:18.890 --> 02:22:21.689
LIAM: He is an expert in things alchemical.

3015
02:22:21.689 --> 02:22:23.240
He's an associate.

3016
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.890
MATT: "Very well. This way,"

3017
02:22:28.648 --> 02:22:30.570
and the guard leads the four of you

3018
02:22:30.570 --> 02:22:33.380
into the main chambers up the staircase

3019
02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:35.570
to the second floor off to the side,

3020
02:22:35.570 --> 02:22:38.700
and to the familiar exterior of Professor Waccoh's study.

3021
02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:42.283
The door itself is closed and the guard approaches.

3022
02:22:42.283 --> 02:22:44.220
(guard knocks)

3023
02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:45.053
"Yeah?"

3024
02:22:45.936 --> 02:22:48.852
"Professor, you have guests."

3025
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:54.040
You hear things unlocking from behind it

3026
02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:56.240
and the door opens up for a second.

3027
02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:59.240
The metallic chains on the inside of the door

3028
02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:02.027
clang against it from the force

3029
02:23:02.027 --> 02:23:04.770
of it being opened and brought to an abrupt halt,

3030
02:23:04.770 --> 02:23:07.773
you see now Waccoh, her head poking out,

3031
02:23:07.773 --> 02:23:12.508
the same eyepiece protracted quite far, looking out.

3032
02:23:12.508 --> 02:23:15.177
The singular tooth poking into the cheek,

3033
02:23:15.177 --> 02:23:18.380
looking out at the midst of you and goes,

3034
02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:20.142
"Oh." (chuckles)

3035
02:23:22.722 --> 02:23:23.840
SAM: Hi.

3036
02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:26.840
MATT: "Was this one here? What's this business here?

3037
02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:30.360
"Oh. Oh. Oh look at you you're small and plump

3038
02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:31.898
"aren't you?"

3039
02:23:31.898 --> 02:23:34.940
SAM: No, he's not plump he's fine.

3040
02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:36.761
MATT: "No you're right actually,

3041
02:23:36.761 --> 02:23:37.594
"he's sallow for a halfling.

3042
02:23:37.594 --> 02:23:39.350
"Sorry didn't mean any offense.

3043
02:23:39.350 --> 02:23:41.840
"This is weird, I don't know you,

3044
02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:42.673
"are these friends of yours?"

3045
02:23:42.673 --> 02:23:44.165
LIAM: Yes they are clever minds

3046
02:23:44.165 --> 02:23:46.100
I thought they would be interested in meeting you

3047
02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:48.020
and you might be interested in meeting them.

3048
02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:50.290
MATT: "All right, well, I am professor Tuss Waccoh.

3049
02:23:50.290 --> 02:23:51.470
"What's your name?"

3050
02:23:51.470 --> 02:23:54.707
SAM: My name is complicated, but--

3051
02:23:54.707 --> 02:23:57.327
MATT: "Complicated, pleasure to meet you.

3052
02:23:57.327 --> 02:23:59.440
"All right, and this halfling here is?"

3053
02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:01.414
SAM: That's Yeza, he's a scientist.

3054
02:24:01.414 --> 02:24:03.814
MATT: "I'm Yeza."
You can see him, kind of taken aback.

3055
02:24:03.814 --> 02:24:06.950
"Oh, are you scared, boy, is that what's going on?

3056
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:08.972
"Don't be scared, I'm just a professor,"

3057
02:24:08.972 --> 02:24:12.380
and leans in real close the hair bouncing

3058
02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:13.847
a bit from her physical movement.

3059
02:24:13.847 --> 02:24:17.278
He leans back. "No, it's a pleasure to meet you."

3060
02:24:17.278 --> 02:24:19.470
Puts the hand out.

3061
02:24:19.470 --> 02:24:21.312
MARISHA: He does the alchemy shit.

3062
02:24:21.312 --> 02:24:24.758
LIAM: Like us he is a special guest of the dynasty.

3063
02:24:24.758 --> 02:24:26.450
MATT: Grabs his hand and pulls him in

3064
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:27.950
and inspects his hand and goes,

3065
02:24:30.264 --> 02:24:32.740
"Yeah, I see some chemical scars here,

3066
02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:34.500
"an alchemist indeed."

3067
02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:36.230
Sets it back to him.

3068
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:37.780
"Well, all right you're here I assume

3069
02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:39.268
"that means either you succeeded or you failed.

3070
02:24:39.268 --> 02:24:41.478
"Good news, bad news, come on in. Follow."

3071
02:24:41.478 --> 02:24:44.650
Opens the door and leads you guys inside.

3072
02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:46.248
You come in and the smell immediately

3073
02:24:46.248 --> 02:24:49.513
smells of like burnt turkey or something burned

3074
02:24:49.513 --> 02:24:53.460
in here and in fact on the far wall

3075
02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:56.220
where you saw one of the tall windows

3076
02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:57.810
that has all these panes in it,

3077
02:24:57.810 --> 02:25:01.860
the wood on that side that had been set in there,

3078
02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:05.340
is burned black and there is like a burn char

3079
02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:07.580
mark across that side of the stone.

3080
02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:10.701
The rest of room looks the same as it was left.

3081
02:25:10.701 --> 02:25:13.680
You see there's a set up on the far desk.

3082
02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:15.790
She immediately grabs a blanket and throws it over,

3083
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:18.030
hiding a bunch of the things that she is working on.

3084
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:19.840
MARISHA: What is she trying to hide?

3085
02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:21.660
MATT: Make a perception check.

3086
02:25:22.793 --> 02:25:26.269
LAURA: See something cool. See something cool.

3087
02:25:27.661 --> 02:25:29.870
(Travis groans)

3088
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:32.520
MARISHA: Why is this the story of my day?

3089
02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:36.550
And my weeks? Six.

3090
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:38.370
MATT: Six. Unfortunately you were focused

3091
02:25:38.370 --> 02:25:40.430
more on the char marks on the wall

3092
02:25:40.430 --> 02:25:41.910
before you realized the blanket being thrown

3093
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:43.385
and it's too late and it's already

3094
02:25:43.385 --> 02:25:44.601
covered whatever's there.

3095
02:25:44.601 --> 02:25:46.200
The shapes that it's covering

3096
02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:49.050
looks to be some sort of--it could be an alchemical

3097
02:25:49.050 --> 02:25:50.740
set, it could be a contraption of some kind,

3098
02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:52.780
whatever it is, whatever this work bench

3099
02:25:52.780 --> 02:25:56.360
desk on the far wall is, it's currently covered.

3100
02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.120
She turns around and goes like,

3101
02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:01.720
"So, what's your business? How'd it go?

3102
02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:03.100
"How'd it go? Did you get the giants?

3103
02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:04.520
"Did you do everything fine? Did you fail?

3104
02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:06.714
"Did you fuck up? Did you lose friends?

3105
02:26:06.714 --> 02:26:08.440
"What happened? Tell me."

3106
02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:11.060
LIAM: We have taken care of you and it has gone optimum.

3107
02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:15.450
Your rival utterly humiliated.

3108
02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:16.890
MATT: Tell me, I need all the details.

3109
02:26:16.890 --> 02:26:19.850
Please, this is--hold on, hold on.

3110
02:26:19.850 --> 02:26:21.340
She grabs a few chairs and scoots

3111
02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:23.150
them up to you goes around grabs her chair

3112
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:25.233
and scoots it up sits down.

3113
02:26:26.575 --> 02:26:28.559
(knuckles cracking)

3114
02:26:28.559 --> 02:26:30.210
"Now tell me please, I want to hear all of it."

3115
02:26:30.210 --> 02:26:31.890
MARISHA: Do you want it chronologically

3116
02:26:31.890 --> 02:26:33.150
or you want the highlights?

3117
02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:35.680
MATT: "No, no, every detail please."

3118
02:26:36.659 --> 02:26:38.156
LIAM: Well, bottom line is that there is no longer

3119
02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:39.200
a giant problem.

3120
02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:40.858
MATT: "Good, good."

3121
02:26:40.858 --> 02:26:41.979
LIAM: That is cleared, yeah?

3122
02:26:41.979 --> 02:26:43.410
MATT: "That is fantastic! We're back in business.

3123
02:26:43.410 --> 02:26:46.051
"Everything going back to Steelworks? We're good?"

3124
02:26:46.051 --> 02:26:47.110
SAM: We're fine.

3125
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:49.271
MATT: "Okay. I'll have to send some specific orders.

3126
02:26:49.271 --> 02:26:50.538
"I've got some new designs for them to start on.

3127
02:26:50.538 --> 02:26:52.596
"And the next wave is going to be almost ready.

3128
02:26:52.596 --> 02:26:55.396
"This is perfect! Your timing is fantastic!

3129
02:26:55.396 --> 02:26:57.783
"I'm really appreciative.

3130
02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:01.145
"And about the foreman, the foreman, the foreman."

3131
02:27:01.145 --> 02:27:02.395
LIAM: I'm not sure. Is it better to re-tell it

3132
02:27:02.395 --> 02:27:03.330
or to give him the letter?

3133
02:27:03.330 --> 02:27:05.520
MARISHA: Yeah, well, let's just say

3134
02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:07.930
that there was a dramatic reading,

3135
02:27:07.930 --> 02:27:10.150
there was a performance. A lot of thought

3136
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:13.450
went into it. I actually learned talents

3137
02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:17.443
from my partners that I didn't know exist. Of this.

3138
02:27:17.443 --> 02:27:19.040
Ah.

3139
02:27:22.450 --> 02:27:24.900
You willing to make a deal with us though?

3140
02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:26.430
MATT: "I already made a deal with you."

3141
02:27:26.430 --> 02:27:28.580
MARISHA: Would you be willing to talk?

3142
02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:30.400
MATT: "Talk about...?"

3143
02:27:31.297 --> 02:27:33.240
MARISHA: Further negotiations.

3144
02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:34.780
MATT: "We had a deal there missy.

3145
02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:37.370
"Don't come in here and try to renegotiate

3146
02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:39.521
"the deal we've already made, I don't work that way.

3147
02:27:39.521 --> 02:27:41.230
"The professor doesn't work that way, okay?"

3148
02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:42.420
MARISHA: I'm not trying to renegotiate

3149
02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:46.170
the deal we made, just express my interest

3150
02:27:46.170 --> 02:27:48.450
in future ones, perhaps?

3151
02:27:48.450 --> 02:27:51.126
MATT: "Oh, more work. My misunderstanding."

3152
02:27:51.126 --> 02:27:52.490
LIAM: We also just believe you'll

3153
02:27:52.490 --> 02:27:53.830
be thoroughly impressed because

3154
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:55.100
he wasn't slightly embarrassed,

3155
02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:56.610
he was utterly humiliated.

3156
02:27:58.736 --> 02:27:59.569
MATT: "That's what I wanted to hear."

3157
02:28:00.546 --> 02:28:02.620
MARISHA: And we accept tips.

3158
02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:03.620
MATT: "Great, tips."

3159
02:28:09.248 --> 02:28:13.939
"Oh hoh, oh no.

3160
02:28:16.264 --> 02:28:19.359
"Oh, his wife's going to love this."

3161
02:28:19.359 --> 02:28:20.878
LIAM: We left him passed out in the mud

3162
02:28:20.878 --> 02:28:22.270
in front of all his workers.

3163
02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:25.770
MATT: "Oh, do go on please."

3164
02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:29.500
MARISHA: Well, he passed out--

3165
02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:31.810
MATT: "From embarrassment?"

3166
02:28:31.810 --> 02:28:33.089
MARISHA: Yeah.

3167
02:28:33.089 --> 02:28:35.210
MATT: "I didn't know that was possible, that's amazing.

3168
02:28:35.210 --> 02:28:37.830
"In front of all the workers?"

3169
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:39.340
LIAM: There were two separate days.

3170
02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:41.396
Day number one, a friend of ours

3171
02:28:41.396 --> 02:28:43.370
who is not here very successfully dressed

3172
02:28:43.370 --> 02:28:44.610
him down in front of his men,

3173
02:28:44.610 --> 02:28:46.140
we thought that was probably enough.

3174
02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:48.575
It probably would've been. But on the way back,

3175
02:28:48.575 --> 02:28:50.710
after your giant problem was taken care of,

3176
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:52.800
there was a bit of dramatic reading,

3177
02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:54.330
a bit of a performance.

3178
02:28:55.330 --> 02:28:57.360
MARISHA: He's also really shitty at hiding letters.

3179
02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:00.367
It was like not even hidden it was just out on the desk.

3180
02:29:00.367 --> 02:29:03.060
He really brought it on himself.

3181
02:29:04.140 --> 02:29:07.760
MATT: "Well, I will say one of my favorite

3182
02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:09.730
"traits in another person I work with

3183
02:29:09.730 --> 02:29:14.260
"is overachievement, so I am very happy.

3184
02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:15.457
"May I keep this?"

3185
02:29:15.457 --> 02:29:17.130
MARISHA: You may.

3186
02:29:17.130 --> 02:29:19.506
MATT: "All right." Goes and tucks

3187
02:29:19.506 --> 02:29:20.339
it in this heavy robe and has to open

3188
02:29:20.339 --> 02:29:21.790
up to like a third pocket on the inside

3189
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:23.080
and stuff it in there.

3190
02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:25.038
MARISHA: That's our little gift

3191
02:29:25.038 --> 02:29:27.836
our little tip if you will.

3192
02:29:29.661 --> 02:29:31.015
Does she get what I'm saying?

3193
02:29:31.015 --> 02:29:32.650
I don't know if she gets what I'm saying.

3194
02:29:32.650 --> 02:29:35.161
SAM: I think she's picking up on it.

3195
02:29:35.161 --> 02:29:36.740
MATT: "If I recall we had some

3196
02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:38.591
"possibilities here. Gems, right? Gems."

3197
02:29:38.591 --> 02:29:40.750
She goes over and starts pulling out

3198
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:43.870
the materials and grabs the sack of gems

3199
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:47.590
and like hits them on some of them scatter out.

3200
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:49.617
"All right, so how much would you like?"

3201
02:29:49.617 --> 02:29:52.909
LIAM: We would be more interested in the items

3202
02:29:52.909 --> 02:29:54.008
that you had.

3203
02:29:54.008 --> 02:29:56.733
MATT: "Right! Right, you made your mind up on that one.

3204
02:29:56.733 --> 02:29:58.149
"All right, fine." takes the gems scoops them in.

3205
02:29:58.149 --> 02:29:59.370
SAM: Don't take them all away

3206
02:29:59.370 --> 02:30:00.760
maybe we could do a little--

3207
02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:03.070
MATT: "A little bit of column A, little bit of column B?"

3208
02:30:03.070 --> 02:30:05.220
SAM: Maybe, maybe, they're really nice.

3209
02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:06.868
MATT: "All right, all right, well

3210
02:30:06.868 --> 02:30:08.951
"I'll leave them here in plain sight.

3211
02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:12.768
"I'll go ahead and--" she reaches

3212
02:30:12.768 --> 02:30:13.986
over in the chest on the side

3213
02:30:13.986 --> 02:30:15.390
and begins pulling some of the items

3214
02:30:15.390 --> 02:30:16.860
and objects from the inside.

3215
02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:18.620
Procuring the robe, the staff, the ring,

3216
02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:20.820
amongst all the other pieces of brass

3217
02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:22.462
and things that she's like,

3218
02:30:22.462 --> 02:30:24.640
"No, they didn't want this, this no,"

3219
02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:26.660
basically scatters them out

3220
02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:28.100
onto the table to the right of her

3221
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:29.780
and goes, "So what you want, what you want?

3222
02:30:29.780 --> 02:30:31.138
You want some gems, you want some items,

3223
02:30:31.138 --> 02:30:32.931
you want all the items, all the gems, what you want?

3224
02:30:32.931 --> 02:30:34.814
LIAM: You know specifically that we want that staff

3225
02:30:34.814 --> 02:30:36.422
for an associate of ours.

3226
02:30:36.422 --> 02:30:39.319
MATT: "Here you go, staff, that's one.

3227
02:30:41.394 --> 02:30:43.700
"What else do you want?"

3228
02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:45.383
LIAM: I am particularly interested

3229
02:30:45.383 --> 02:30:48.210
in that ring, Beauregard, would you be all right with that?

3230
02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:51.670
MARISHA: Yes, I think I would approve of that ring.

3231
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:53.880
SAM: Is that the only other item we get?

3232
02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:56.430
MARISHA: Well, there's that flashy robe one.

3233
02:30:56.430 --> 02:30:59.101
SAM: I know but two items, that's the deal?

3234
02:30:59.101 --> 02:31:00.720
MATT: "Well, there was two items

3235
02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:02.562
"and then because you have so thoroughly

3236
02:31:02.562 --> 02:31:04.900
"done a fantastic job of embarrassing the foreman

3237
02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:06.700
"in front of, well, pretty much everybody

3238
02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:10.542
"he's ever cared about--especially once I deliver this note--

3239
02:31:10.542 --> 02:31:12.476
"that was a third item.

3240
02:31:12.476 --> 02:31:14.034
"So it's your choice--

3241
02:31:14.034 --> 02:31:17.180
"would you like the robe or some of the other pieces

3242
02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:18.773
"of pottery here?"

3243
02:31:18.773 --> 02:31:21.010
LIAM: There was a blade wasn't there?

3244
02:31:21.010 --> 02:31:23.320
MATT: "Right yeah. It's broken."

3245
02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:24.986
SAM: If we wanted to substitute

3246
02:31:24.986 --> 02:31:27.603
the third item for gems how many would that be?

3247
02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:32.233
MATT: You see her do some calculations in her head.

3248
02:31:32.233 --> 02:31:35.627
"Put like--let's call it three thousand

3249
02:31:35.627 --> 02:31:38.444
"gold worth of gems. Your call."

3250
02:31:38.444 --> 02:31:39.724
SAM: It's pretty good.

3251
02:31:39.724 --> 02:31:42.598
MARISHA: It's enough for a tattoo,

3252
02:31:42.598 --> 02:31:44.730
for the start of a tattoo.

3253
02:31:44.730 --> 02:31:47.374
MATT: "Or this broken blade, it's up to you."

3254
02:31:47.374 --> 02:31:48.800
SAM: What is the broken blade?

3255
02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:50.850
MATT: "It's some sort of a keepsake,

3256
02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:55.040
"still trying to ascertain what the basis

3257
02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:56.720
"of its enchantment was but--"

3258
02:31:56.720 --> 02:31:59.810
SAM: Caleb is very smart about these things.

3259
02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:02.000
MATT: "I'm also quite smart."

3260
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.510
MARISHA: Does it look anything close to the broken

3261
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:07.217
blade that we already have in our possession?

3262
02:32:07.217 --> 02:32:09.292
MATT: Make a perception check.

3263
02:32:11.502 --> 02:32:13.293
MARISHA: I've been rolling so terribly today.

3264
02:32:13.293 --> 02:32:14.268
LIAM: But not this time.

3265
02:32:14.268 --> 02:32:15.101
MARISHA: Ooh!

3266
02:32:16.643 --> 02:32:18.890
MARISHA: 19! Perception, I'm assuming.

3267
02:32:18.890 --> 02:32:21.213
MATT: Perception. From this point you look over

3268
02:32:21.213 --> 02:32:22.950
and you glance and you take in

3269
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:24.533
the break of the blade.

3270
02:32:24.533 --> 02:32:26.291
It's also part that I'll consider

3271
02:32:26.291 --> 02:32:28.120
recollection and tying the two together.

3272
02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:30.197
It looks pretty similar of make.

3273
02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:33.105
SAM: What are the odds.

3274
02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:38.116
MARISHA: It's not. There are no odds.

3275
02:32:38.116 --> 02:32:39.633
It's not a coincidence. It can't be.

3276
02:32:39.633 --> 02:32:41.603
LIAM: There will always be coin,

3277
02:32:41.603 --> 02:32:43.910
there will always be gems.

3278
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:46.476
MATT: She's holding the blade and looking at it, going--

3279
02:32:49.984 --> 02:32:53.270
LIAM: Would you be averse to me taking a moment?

3280
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:55.973
MATT: "Oh take your time, that's fine, no worries."

3281
02:32:55.973 --> 02:32:57.605
LIAM: All right, I'll just sit down

3282
02:32:57.605 --> 02:32:59.750
in the middle of her floor and plant it on the ground

3283
02:32:59.750 --> 02:33:02.979
and pull out my book and I'm going to cast

3284
02:33:02.979 --> 02:33:05.996
Identify as a ritual spell right in the middle of her room.

3285
02:33:05.996 --> 02:33:08.782
MATT: Okay. You complete the spell, take the blade.

3286
02:33:10.823 --> 02:33:12.260
Spell's not taking.

3287
02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:14.300
Something about the fractured aspect of it

3288
02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:16.844
is preventing any clarity.

3289
02:33:16.844 --> 02:33:18.200
SAM: A broken blade doesn't seem like a lot.

3290
02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:20.300
Maybe--I'm just throwing it out there--

3291
02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:24.900
broken blade plus 15 hundred of the gold of the gems.

3292
02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:26.682
It's a broken blade, what are you

3293
02:33:26.682 --> 02:33:28.114
going to do with a broken blade?

3294
02:33:29.231 --> 02:33:31.040
Kill half a person? Can't do that.

3295
02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:33.294
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3296
02:33:33.294 --> 02:33:34.436
SAM: Oh, I'm good at that.

3297
02:33:34.436 --> 02:33:35.445
TALIESIN: Yeah, you are.

3298
02:33:35.445 --> 02:33:36.434
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

3299
02:33:36.434 --> 02:33:37.368
SAM: Four.

3300
02:33:38.943 --> 02:33:39.812
Minus--

3301
02:33:39.812 --> 02:33:41.788
No, five. I got a plus one.

3302
02:33:41.788 --> 02:33:43.296
MATT: There you go.

3303
02:33:45.596 --> 02:33:47.729
"I will say, while it may be broken,

3304
02:33:47.729 --> 02:33:49.629
"there is some possible cultural significance here,

3305
02:33:49.629 --> 02:33:52.890
"maybe like in a museum or, if I can find a way

3306
02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:55.030
"to extract the basis of this enchantment

3307
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:58.104
"it can be translocated to another object,

3308
02:33:58.104 --> 02:34:00.204
"which is something I have done in the past.

3309
02:34:00.204 --> 02:34:02.237
"That could also be useful. So I'm going to say no,

3310
02:34:02.237 --> 02:34:05.324
"you choose the item or you take the gems. Your call."

3311
02:34:05.324 --> 02:34:06.790
LIAM: You are hanging on it, <i>ja</i>?

3312
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:07.640
MARISHA: Yeah.

3313
02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:09.190
You should trust your instinct.

3314
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:10.840
MARISHA: What, the sword?

3315
02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:11.673
LIAM: Yeah.

3316
02:34:11.673 --> 02:34:13.323
MARISHA: I mean, that's--

3317
02:34:14.573 --> 02:34:16.131
it's a sword right?

3318
02:34:16.131 --> 02:34:17.665
LIAM: Trust your instincts.

3319
02:34:17.665 --> 02:34:19.448
TALIESIN: I'm not making eye contact.

3320
02:34:19.448 --> 02:34:21.460
LAURA: Get the sword. [pigeon coos]

3321
02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:23.560
MARISHA: How about this.

3322
02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:27.807
We'll take the sword and you give us

3323
02:34:29.008 --> 02:34:32.183
90 minutes in your awesome library

3324
02:34:33.467 --> 02:34:36.241
in the special book section.

3325
02:34:36.241 --> 02:34:39.099
LIAM: I was going to ask for unlimited access, but okay.

3326
02:34:39.099 --> 02:34:43.478
(laughter)

3327
02:34:43.478 --> 02:34:45.251
MARISHA: Or. Unlimited access.

3328
02:34:45.251 --> 02:34:48.068
MATT: "Yeah, you see, that's the thing.

3329
02:34:48.068 --> 02:34:51.370
"The library here is only really open to members

3330
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:52.950
"of the conservatory and its staff,

3331
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:55.610
"so unlimited access is not viable."

3332
02:34:55.610 --> 02:34:57.939
MARISHA: But 90 minutes?

3333
02:34:57.939 --> 02:34:59.490
LIAM: How about a day?

3334
02:34:59.490 --> 02:35:02.280
And I'm holding up the medallion

3335
02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:03.962
given to me by the empress.

3336
02:35:03.962 --> 02:35:06.390
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage

3337
02:35:06.390 --> 02:35:08.657
because he's holding up the medallion.

3338
02:35:09.651 --> 02:35:12.226
MARISHA: Persuasion check. That's not great.

3339
02:35:12.226 --> 02:35:13.209
That one's cocked.

3340
02:35:13.209 --> 02:35:14.650
LIAM: Yes, it is cocked.

3341
02:35:14.650 --> 02:35:17.890
MARISHA: Oh, did you see that? Why does it always happen?

3342
02:35:17.890 --> 02:35:20.398
It's the same roll. Seven.

3343
02:35:20.398 --> 02:35:21.698
SAM: Wow!

3344
02:35:22.765 --> 02:35:24.747
Wow!

3345
02:35:24.747 --> 02:35:26.639
MATT: "I'm sorry, there's certain things

3346
02:35:26.639 --> 02:35:29.140
"that are off limits and there's a good reason for that.

3347
02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:31.740
"I mean no offense, and you've all been very very useful,

3348
02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:34.250
"but there are things that are best kept under

3349
02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:36.630
"lock and key for those who have <i>long-term</i> proven

3350
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:40.340
"their association and loyalty to the Bright Queen

3351
02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:42.494
"and all that we hope to achieve here

3352
02:35:42.494 --> 02:35:44.191
"at the Marble Tomes Conservatory."

3353
02:35:44.191 --> 02:35:45.541
SAM: Can I make one more offer?

3354
02:35:45.541 --> 02:35:47.170
MATT: "What is your offer?"

3355
02:35:47.170 --> 02:35:52.100
SAM: I am a lowly adventurer but my husband here

3356
02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:55.168
is a fantastic mind, and if you have any need

3357
02:35:55.168 --> 02:35:59.860
of any alchemical knowledge or expertise

3358
02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:01.610
I bet he could help you out.

3359
02:36:01.610 --> 02:36:02.830
MATT: "You talking apprenticeship?

3360
02:36:02.830 --> 02:36:04.581
"What, you want to apprentice here?"

3361
02:36:04.581 --> 02:36:05.735
SAM: No, no, not apprenticeship.

3362
02:36:05.735 --> 02:36:06.990
No, just one little piece of advice

3363
02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:08.598
if a puzzle you can't crack something,

3364
02:36:08.598 --> 02:36:10.698
something you've been working--

3365
02:36:10.698 --> 02:36:13.810
MARISHA: Nott, an apprenticeship could be awesome.

3366
02:36:13.810 --> 02:36:15.970
Especially if we're going to be here for some time.

3367
02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:20.288
SAM: What would it entail?

3368
02:36:21.854 --> 02:36:23.266
MATT: "Well, first off we'd have to get it cleared

3369
02:36:23.266 --> 02:36:25.390
"because we haven't really never had a halfling here.

3370
02:36:25.390 --> 02:36:27.459
"So there'd be a period of time in approving

3371
02:36:27.459 --> 02:36:29.700
"of his presence to ensure that there isn't

3372
02:36:29.700 --> 02:36:32.890
"any sort of, you know, Empire interests

3373
02:36:32.890 --> 02:36:34.870
"or muck behind the history there.

3374
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:37.430
"After which we'd have to go and get approvals

3375
02:36:37.430 --> 02:36:40.150
"from Den Thelyss, then we'd have to

3376
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:42.410
"ensure that he works under me

3377
02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:44.370
"for the period of the internship,

3378
02:36:44.370 --> 02:36:46.140
"which can mean--depending on what you're

3379
02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:47.900
"looking to learn and what we're looking to do--

3380
02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:50.372
"two three years. Up to you."

3381
02:36:51.389 --> 02:36:54.496
Yeza's just like, "What about our son?"

3382
02:36:54.496 --> 02:36:56.638
SAM: Yeah we're not going to do that, don't worry.

3383
02:36:56.638 --> 02:36:57.950
MATT: (as Waccoh) "Okay, well then no worries."

3384
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:59.689
SAM: But if there's a singular question

3385
02:36:59.689 --> 02:37:01.380
you have, or puzzle to solve

3386
02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:02.440
he might be able to aid you.

3387
02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:05.771
MATT: "Wonderful, and if I think about it I'll contact you."

3388
02:37:05.771 --> 02:37:07.171
LIAM: I do have a question for you.

3389
02:37:07.171 --> 02:37:09.658
We will take this sword fragment and the ring.

3390
02:37:09.658 --> 02:37:12.040
MATT: "There you go." Throws it down

3391
02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:14.430
haphazardly, it clings on the edge

3392
02:37:14.430 --> 02:37:15.950
of the table, and you have to catch it.

3393
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:17.540
LIAM: I have an honest question for you.

3394
02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:19.087
MATT: "What's your question?"

3395
02:37:19.087 --> 02:37:20.760
LIAM: As proclaimed heroes of the dynasty

3396
02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:22.760
by the Lady of Kryn herself,

3397
02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:24.376
what do we need to do to further establish

3398
02:37:24.376 --> 02:37:26.530
our trust with you, specifically,

3399
02:37:26.530 --> 02:37:29.921
and the Marble Tomes, because we are willing to do it.

3400
02:37:29.921 --> 02:37:33.460
MATT: "Well, for one thing I would say

3401
02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:36.490
"continue doing great little favors like this.

3402
02:37:36.490 --> 02:37:38.435
"Continue to help us with our war effort.

3403
02:37:38.435 --> 02:37:41.430
"Continue to prove through actions

3404
02:37:41.430 --> 02:37:43.990
"and not just words that you believe

3405
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:45.540
"in what we're trying to accomplish."

3406
02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:47.940
LIAM: We have supplied you with many actions

3407
02:37:47.940 --> 02:37:49.200
and a few words as well.

3408
02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.620
I understand your position and we are eager

3409
02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:54.620
to show our use to you, so I hope

3410
02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:56.979
you will continue to allow us to do that.

3411
02:37:56.979 --> 02:37:57.812
MATT: "Of course, and I will--

3412
02:37:57.812 --> 02:37:59.850
"based on the information you've given me today--

3413
02:37:59.850 --> 02:38:01.690
"I'll check it and see how well things

3414
02:38:01.690 --> 02:38:03.350
"are at the Steelworks going forward.

3415
02:38:03.350 --> 02:38:06.100
"If indeed things are moving as well as you say

3416
02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:08.150
"and that gives us maybe a few weeks

3417
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:09.930
"before the things that we were in the process

02:38:09.930 --> 02:38:11.210
"of creating should be ready, finished,

02:38:11.210 --> 02:38:12.920
"and shipping out to the west--

3420
02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:15.160
"in which case in the meantime I'll start

3421
02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:17.570
"looking for more jobs for you.

3422
02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:19.308
"Plenty of weird things happen around here

3423
02:38:19.308 --> 02:38:20.560
"so I'm sure we could use your help."

3424
02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:23.455
LIAM: If I may, check in with the royal line as well.

3425
02:38:23.455 --> 02:38:27.160
Ask about us. I think you might be illuminated by it.

3426
02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:29.050
MATT: "Okay. I also want to let you know

3427
02:38:29.050 --> 02:38:34.010
"that to show just how graciously they've

3428
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:37.440
"accepted you for whatever great thing you did

02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:39.520
"for them, you're both alive in the middle

"Let's just say that that's also

"part of the gift and favor you've been granted.

3434
02:38:48.866 --> 02:38:51.920
"Now we made a deal, I've paid you fairly

3435
02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:53.420
"and then some for what you've done.

3436
02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:54.600
"I don't mean this as an offense

02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:56.540
"but I mean, you come in here and start squeezing

"my balls on this, I just wanted to, you know,

3439
02:38:58.391 --> 02:39:00.401
"make it a fair above board transaction."

3440
02:39:00.401 --> 02:39:01.709
LIAM: We are grateful.

3441
02:39:01.709 --> 02:39:03.186
We know our worth

3442
02:39:03.186 --> 02:39:05.926
but we are very grateful thank you.

3443
02:39:05.926 --> 02:39:08.305
MATT: "Hey, I don't hold the Tomes, all right?

3444
02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:09.707
"I'm not going to put my neck out there

3445
02:39:09.707 --> 02:39:11.810
"to go ahead and get--no offense--a couple of humies

3447
02:39:13.690 --> 02:39:15.750
"I got to be careful and watch my own back.

02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:17.970
"Keep working, maybe we can pull some favors

02:39:17.970 --> 02:39:19.720
"in time and I'll see what I can do."

3450
02:39:20.921 --> 02:39:22.150
LIAM: <i>Verstehen</i>.

3451
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:23.888
MATT: "All right, we square?

3452
02:39:23.888 --> 02:39:25.818
"We square, little guy?"

3453
02:39:25.818 --> 02:39:27.580
Yeza's like--

3454
02:39:27.580 --> 02:39:29.667
"All right. Get out."

3455
02:39:30.875 --> 02:39:32.250
SAM: Bye.
MARISHA: Bye.

3456
02:39:32.250 --> 02:39:34.016
LIAM: (Vaudeville exit music)

3457
02:39:35.217 --> 02:39:37.860
SAM: She called you "humies."

3458
02:39:37.860 --> 02:39:38.940
LIAM: It's fine.

3459
02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:39.773
MARISHA: It's fair.

3460
02:39:39.773 --> 02:39:41.460
SAM: It's offensive.

3461
02:39:41.460 --> 02:39:42.370
LIAM: It's accurate.

3462
02:39:42.370 --> 02:39:43.975
MARISHA: We humies have also done a lot

3463
02:39:43.975 --> 02:39:45.377
of offensive things so--

3464
02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:48.450
SAM: Well, we go back to our friends.

3465
02:39:48.450 --> 02:39:50.581
MATT: You guys are escorted off the Marble Tomes.

3466
02:39:50.581 --> 02:39:51.681
SAM: But they're off doing something.

3467
02:39:51.681 --> 02:39:52.862
MATT: While you guys are doing that,

3468
02:39:52.862 --> 02:39:55.610
you guys are in the process of searching

3469
02:39:55.610 --> 02:39:58.465
for, what, the Overcrow, you said?

3470
02:39:58.465 --> 02:40:00.372
LAURA: Yeah!

3471
02:40:00.372 --> 02:40:02.401
TALIESIN: Gently, gently.

3472
02:40:02.401 --> 02:40:04.669
(Matt laughs)

3473
02:40:04.669 --> 02:40:08.132
MATT: All righty. Still trudging through

3474
02:40:08.132 --> 02:40:11.560
the day rain, you begin to ask around.

3475
02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:14.067
Who's helming this? Who's asking the questions

3476
02:40:14.067 --> 02:40:15.770
and trying to get a bead?

3477
02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:17.602
TALIESIN: I'll do it. If you guys

3478
02:40:17.602 --> 02:40:19.250
are looking for a shop, then I'll--

3479
02:40:19.250 --> 02:40:21.203
MATT: I'm saying one of you has to take point

3480
02:40:21.203 --> 02:40:22.332
in the attempt to--

3481
02:40:22.332 --> 02:40:24.169
TALIESIN: I'll take point if you guys want.

3482
02:40:24.169 --> 02:40:27.064
LAURA: Sure. I can not do that.

3483
02:40:27.064 --> 02:40:28.450
MATT: You can choose to do either

3484
02:40:28.450 --> 02:40:30.090
investigation or persuasion your choice.

3485
02:40:30.090 --> 02:40:31.673
TALIESIN: Definitely persuasion.

3486
02:40:31.673 --> 02:40:32.656
MATT: Okay.

3487
02:40:32.656 --> 02:40:34.386
TALIESIN: Not a good investigator.

3488
02:40:37.250 --> 02:40:38.347
14.

3489
02:40:38.347 --> 02:40:40.317
MATT: 14, okay.

3490
02:40:40.317 --> 02:40:42.730
TALIESIN: Oh, investigation or persuasion?

3491
02:40:42.730 --> 02:40:43.763
MATT: Yeah, your choice.

3492
02:40:43.763 --> 02:40:45.395
TALIESIN: Oh nevermind, that's much worse.

3493
02:40:45.395 --> 02:40:46.750
I'm sorry, I hit the wrong number.

3494
02:40:46.750 --> 02:40:48.120
LAURA: Oh, you're bad at both.

3495
02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:49.120
TALIESIN: Oh, I am.

3496
02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:50.700
That's eight.

3497
02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:52.580
MATT: All right.

3498
02:40:52.580 --> 02:40:53.617
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

3499
02:40:53.617 --> 02:40:54.958
LAURA: Guess I should've been doing that.

3500
02:40:54.958 --> 02:40:56.408
TALIESIN: Yeah, you should've been doing that.

3501
02:40:56.408 --> 02:40:59.210
MATT: For the first three hours

3502
02:40:59.210 --> 02:41:02.970
of your travel through the Gallimaufry,

3503
02:41:02.970 --> 02:41:07.180
you stumble upon heavy working ogres

3504
02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:09.540
and goblins and ornery bugbears

3505
02:41:09.540 --> 02:41:11.620
transporting goods and resources

3506
02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:12.890
from side of the city to the other.

3507
02:41:12.890 --> 02:41:17.300
You can see various beast folk

3508
02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:19.370
children and waste folk children

3509
02:41:19.370 --> 02:41:21.050
running through streets and screaming.

3510
02:41:21.050 --> 02:41:23.752
And every time you try to start a conversation,

3511
02:41:23.752 --> 02:41:27.858
people go, "I--eh," and ignore you.

3512
02:41:27.858 --> 02:41:29.057
TALIESIN: This is weird, I don't

3513
02:41:29.057 --> 02:41:31.286
know what to do with my hands.

3514
02:41:31.286 --> 02:41:33.680
Never had that happen. Do you always think about that?

3515
02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:36.059
Do you always think about where your hands--?

3516
02:41:36.059 --> 02:41:37.747
Because suddenly it's all I can think about,

3517
02:41:37.747 --> 02:41:40.000
it's like, oh are they supposed to be in your pockets?

3518
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.190
Or I mean, cause it's cold out.

3519
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:42.489
TRAVIS: Hey, Caduceus.

3520
02:41:42.489 --> 02:41:43.889
This is not really

3521
02:41:45.297 --> 02:41:46.663
getting us anywhere.

3522
02:41:47.647 --> 02:41:49.072
Maybe I could give it a try.

3523
02:41:49.072 --> 02:41:52.272
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, no, absolutely. You are--

3524
02:41:52.272 --> 02:41:54.067
TRAVIS: If you don't mind.

3525
02:41:54.067 --> 02:41:56.110
Okay, can I go up?

3526
02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:58.108
MATT: You can try it as well, yeah.

3527
02:41:58.108 --> 02:42:00.905
TRAVIS: Investigation check.

3528
02:42:00.905 --> 02:42:02.088
(groaning)

3529
02:42:02.088 --> 02:42:02.921
Damn it.

3530
02:42:02.921 --> 02:42:04.052
MATT: Or persuasion, your choice.

3531
02:42:05.327 --> 02:42:06.710
TRAVIS: 12.

3532
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:08.068
MATT: Okay, okay.

3533
02:42:08.970 --> 02:42:10.370
Takes you another 20 minutes or so,

3534
02:42:10.370 --> 02:42:12.390
but eventually--you're trying to find somebody

3535
02:42:12.390 --> 02:42:14.490
who looks both knowledgeable and not in the middle

3536
02:42:14.490 --> 02:42:16.050
of something that would be willing

3537
02:42:16.050 --> 02:42:17.450
to engage.

3538
02:42:17.450 --> 02:42:19.410
Especially with the downpour,

3539
02:42:19.410 --> 02:42:21.797
folks seem to be a little more shut off than usual.

3540
02:42:25.685 --> 02:42:26.817
TRAVIS: It's what?

3541
02:42:26.817 --> 02:42:27.870
TALIESIN: It's like your hands

3542
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:29.906
just know where to be, I don't know.

3543
02:42:32.989 --> 02:42:35.940
MATT: You are eventually told to make

3544
02:42:35.940 --> 02:42:37.110
your way towards the Coronas,

3545
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:39.753
which is the outermost edge of the city.

3546
02:42:39.753 --> 02:42:41.270
TRAVIS: Did we go through there to get to the--?

3547
02:42:41.270 --> 02:42:42.378
MATT: Correct.

3548
02:42:42.378 --> 02:42:44.170
You're sent to the Coronas,

3549
02:42:44.170 --> 02:42:48.137
towards more of the western side of the city.

3550
02:42:48.137 --> 02:42:51.120
Maybe a 15 minute walk along the south outer

3551
02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:53.240
edge from the western most road

3552
02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:55.850
that exits into the Ghostlands.

3553
02:42:55.850 --> 02:42:57.500
Walking past this neighborhood

3554
02:42:57.500 --> 02:43:00.349
there's all manner of

3555
02:43:01.816 --> 02:43:04.470
stacked shanty towns.

3556
02:43:04.470 --> 02:43:06.490
Especially more in the goblin

3557
02:43:06.490 --> 02:43:08.560
districts here, there are shacks and homes

3558
02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:10.810
that are pushed on each other.

3559
02:43:10.810 --> 02:43:12.220
Some of them look a little ramshackle

3560
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:13.720
and ready to slide or crumble

3561
02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:15.427
yet still seem to hold together.

3562
02:43:15.427 --> 02:43:17.520
Whether that be a quirk

3563
02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:21.090
of goblin architecture or just over time

3564
02:43:21.090 --> 02:43:22.640
just learning to find a proper balance

3565
02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:24.530
of things that are placed,

3566
02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:26.260
it's impressive, and also you kind of

3567
02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:27.921
keep to the center of the road

3568
02:43:27.921 --> 02:43:29.175
in case anything slides off.

3569
02:43:29.175 --> 02:43:30.373
It's a little precarious.

3570
02:43:30.373 --> 02:43:33.367
Eventually making your way through the crowds,

3571
02:43:33.367 --> 02:43:35.730
try not to call too much attention to yourselves

3572
02:43:35.730 --> 02:43:37.944
though there are a few eyes that stare at you, Yasha,

3573
02:43:37.944 --> 02:43:40.340
and a few at you as well.

3574
02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:42.151
You guys do catch a little bit of attention,

3575
02:43:42.151 --> 02:43:44.570
less on Jester and Fjord's route,

3576
02:43:44.570 --> 02:43:46.040
but you do have a color scheme

3577
02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:48.530
that is not common amongst the city.

3578
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:51.660
TALIESIN: No, we went shopping I'm blendy.

3579
02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:53.975
MATT: Oh, fair enough. You have your Xhorhasian clothing.

3580
02:43:55.592 --> 02:43:58.430
You do as well, but you are still a human.

3581
02:43:58.430 --> 02:44:00.240
But nobody seems to be following.

3582
02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:03.670
They're just gruff and snarl a bit,

3583
02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:05.800
seem to not want to engage.

3584
02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:08.650
Take a wide berth around you.

3585
02:44:08.650 --> 02:44:11.230
Eventually you come upon

3586
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:14.410
a narrow but tall two-story structure,

3587
02:44:14.410 --> 02:44:17.560
with mismatched roofing, lengths of chain

3588
02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:18.910
running along the edges of the roof,

3589
02:44:18.910 --> 02:44:22.180
where lanterns and knick-knacks hang from it.

3590
02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:23.930
You see a single wooden sign

3591
02:44:23.930 --> 02:44:25.810
that hangs over the top that says

3592
02:44:25.810 --> 02:44:27.876
The Overcrow Apothecary.

3593
02:44:27.876 --> 02:44:29.476
(gasping)

3594
02:44:29.476 --> 02:44:30.943
LAURA: It's an apothecary.

3595
02:44:30.943 --> 02:44:32.051
LIAM: Oh shit.

3596
02:44:32.051 --> 02:44:33.176
MARISHA: Interesting.

3597
02:44:33.176 --> 02:44:34.009
TRAVIS: Nice.

3598
02:44:34.009 --> 02:44:34.842
LAURA: Yeah.

3599
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:37.690
TRAVIS: As we've been making our way

3600
02:44:37.690 --> 02:44:39.320
within the ramshackle areas,

3601
02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:42.220
do we see other things like other markets

3602
02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:45.450
or stores or temples or anything like that

3603
02:44:45.450 --> 02:44:47.890
that stands out as a structure that's dedicated

3604
02:44:47.890 --> 02:44:50.690
to something specifically besides lodging, or--?

3605
02:44:50.690 --> 02:44:54.225
MATT: As you're heading from the Gallimaufry

3606
02:44:54.225 --> 02:44:58.770
to the Coronas, there are places of business

3607
02:44:58.770 --> 02:45:02.437
most of them seem to be general goods, food,

3608
02:45:05.310 --> 02:45:08.330
knick-knacks, handmade little carts on the side

3609
02:45:08.330 --> 02:45:10.420
that have handmade goods and jewelry.

3610
02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:14.270
Most of the shops here appear

3611
02:45:14.270 --> 02:45:17.160
to be not geared towards the more noble dens of the city,

3612
02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:21.110
tend to be more for functionality and general use.

3613
02:45:22.540 --> 02:45:24.530
No temples. Most of those seem to gathered

3614
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:26.559
towards the center of the city in the Firmament

3615
02:45:26.559 --> 02:45:28.710
and that area.

3616
02:45:29.890 --> 02:45:32.390
Are you looking for any particular shop?

3617
02:45:32.390 --> 02:45:34.090
TRAVIS: Just curious what we saw.

3618
02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:35.633
MATT: You do pass by the--

3619
02:45:35.633 --> 02:45:38.060
TRAVIS: There's no barracks or anything

3620
02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:40.880
there's a collection of guards or other things that would--?

3621
02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:43.250
MATT: Not that you've come across yet, no.

3622
02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:45.058
You could look for one if you'd like.

3623
02:45:45.058 --> 02:45:46.491
But you don't see that here.

3624
02:45:50.183 --> 02:45:51.841
You do pass by the Hammered Call,

3625
02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:55.800
which was the armory where you guys had been previously.

3626
02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:57.500
TRAVIS: Was that where Wursh--?

3627
02:45:57.500 --> 02:45:58.880
MATT: Wursh the Tapper was, yeah.

3628
02:45:59.950 --> 02:46:01.140
You pass by there, but beyond

3629
02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:02.970
that there's been no other places

3630
02:46:02.970 --> 02:46:04.760
unless you're specifically looking

3631
02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:07.550
for a particular type of business that catches your eye.

3632
02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:10.250
You're standing outside the apothecary in the rain.

3633
02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:12.699
LAURA: Should we go in?

3634
02:46:12.699 --> 02:46:16.266
TRAVIS: This was the location of--?

3635
02:46:17.316 --> 02:46:19.902
LAURA: That's where they said they were going to meet.

3636
02:46:19.902 --> 02:46:21.168
TRAVIS: They were going to meet,

3637
02:46:21.168 --> 02:46:23.146
they weren't going to place another thing here,

3638
02:46:23.146 --> 02:46:25.170
were they? Or we're not sure?

3639
02:46:25.170 --> 02:46:27.050
LAURA: They were meeting, I think.

3640
02:46:27.050 --> 02:46:28.400
TALIESIN: Let's just go inside

3641
02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:31.450
maybe try and buy some healing potions.

3642
02:46:31.450 --> 02:46:32.480
TRAVIS: Average patrons.

3643
02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:34.121
TALIESIN: Just nothing fancy.

3644
02:46:34.121 --> 02:46:35.830
Let's just get a lay of the territory.

3645
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:37.621
LAURA: Get the vibe.

3646
02:46:37.621 --> 02:46:38.980
TALIESIN: Before we go in I'm definitely

3647
02:46:38.980 --> 02:46:40.810
going to cast Detect Magic.

3648
02:46:40.810 --> 02:46:41.643
MATT: Okay.

3649
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:44.757
You cast Detect Magic.

3650
02:46:47.250 --> 02:46:51.050
You get a very faint magical essence

3651
02:46:51.050 --> 02:46:52.500
from the inside the building.

3652
02:46:53.430 --> 02:46:54.910
TALIESIN: Guys ready to go shopping?

3653
02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:56.710
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3654
02:46:57.556 --> 02:46:58.640
TRAVIS: Let's shop.

3655
02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:01.590
MATT: You guys enter the chamber

3656
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:04.000
and on the inside of the apothecary

3657
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:07.320
you--surprisingly sparse display

3658
02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:12.040
of herbs, ointments, oils, alchemical supplies.

3659
02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:13.690
For the interior space, like I said

3660
02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:15.232
it's thin but tall.

3661
02:47:15.232 --> 02:47:19.200
The shelves here seem to be a little more barren

3662
02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.740
in comparison to some of the more cluttered

3663
02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:22.850
herbalists that you've come across in your past.

3664
02:47:22.850 --> 02:47:24.640
They do have supplies on display.

3665
02:47:28.367 --> 02:47:30.890
You do see however a lot of oily blankets,

3666
02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:33.040
and piles of empty wooden crates scattered everywhere

3667
02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:35.140
in like a semi-hoarder atmosphere,

3668
02:47:35.140 --> 02:47:37.313
this entire room is a fire hazard.

3669
02:47:38.450 --> 02:47:40.680
Just the smell in it between the various herbs

3670
02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:44.000
there is definitely a heavy flammable

3671
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:47.023
oil scent in the air akin to someone

3672
02:47:47.023 --> 02:47:48.940
spilled gasoline in your car.

3673
02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:51.050
There's just that smell that's present,

3674
02:47:51.050 --> 02:47:53.180
it's soaked in to the area.

3675
02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:54.980
LIAM: Keep Caleb away.

3676
02:47:56.156 --> 02:47:57.595
MATT: You see a rickety spiral staircase

3677
02:47:57.595 --> 02:47:58.786
in the far right corner

3678
02:47:58.786 --> 02:48:00.050
that seems to go up to the second floor,

3679
02:48:00.050 --> 02:48:02.912
and across the room from you you see

3680
02:48:02.912 --> 02:48:05.279
clipping toenails with a small knife,

3681
02:48:05.279 --> 02:48:10.279
this young goblin with her legs

3682
02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:15.827
up on the edge of a desk table arrangement,

3683
02:48:15.827 --> 02:48:17.410
and you can see these long nails

3684
02:48:17.410 --> 02:48:19.770
curling forward that are darkened on the corners,

3685
02:48:19.770 --> 02:48:21.660
and she's just cutting it off

3686
02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:25.173
with a blade like you'd cut a pears outer edge

3687
02:48:25.173 --> 02:48:26.590
or skin an apple.

3688
02:48:29.425 --> 02:48:32.552
(high-pitched grating voice) "Yeah, come in, come in.

3689
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:35.035
"Can I help you?"

3690
02:48:35.997 --> 02:48:37.238
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3691
02:48:38.204 --> 02:48:40.241
TALIESIN: We're looking for possibly

3692
02:48:40.241 --> 02:48:42.300
just doing some comparison shopping, healing potions.

3693
02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:44.360
We're also looking for like ink and parchment

3694
02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:46.950
if you carry such things or otherwise.

3695
02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.966
MATT: "Ink's not really a specialty of mine.

3696
02:48:50.966 --> 02:48:53.303
"Parchment, I guess I can get you some?"

3697
02:48:53.303 --> 02:48:54.711
TALIESIN: What's your specialty?

3698
02:48:54.711 --> 02:48:56.554
MATT: As she leans forward you can see

3699
02:48:56.554 --> 02:49:01.187
there is a faint underbite, and a row

3700
02:49:01.187 --> 02:49:04.240
of sharp teeth hook forward

3701
02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:06.230
from under the upper lip.

3702
02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:09.630
The ears look chewed a bit on the sides,

3703
02:49:09.630 --> 02:49:11.720
this goblin's seen some tougher days.

3704
02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:14.710
But seems to be positive and smiling in your direction.

3705
02:49:14.710 --> 02:49:17.810
These very bright yellow eyes.

3706
02:49:19.410 --> 02:49:22.550
She leans forward and goes,

3707
02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:24.200
"Just parchment and ink? Want else want anything else?"

3708
02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:25.733
LAURA: What is your specialty?

3709
02:49:25.733 --> 02:49:27.174
TALIESIN: Yeah you mentioned specialties?

3710
02:49:27.174 --> 02:49:31.327
MATT: "Well. We got to oils,

3711
02:49:31.327 --> 02:49:34.100
"we got things to help with your cracked skin,

3712
02:49:34.100 --> 02:49:36.116
"if want to get out in the sun.

3713
02:49:36.116 --> 02:49:39.690
"We got things that'll make your cheeks nice and flush.

3714
02:49:39.690 --> 02:49:42.910
"We got to things that'll help with digestion,

3715
02:49:42.910 --> 02:49:45.230
"we got things that'll help you grow better hair

3716
02:49:45.230 --> 02:49:47.738
"like silky and shiny--

3717
02:49:47.738 --> 02:49:49.523
LAURA: That's cool.

3718
02:49:50.607 --> 02:49:52.224
TALIESIN: Am I getting a Detect Magic

3719
02:49:52.224 --> 02:49:53.351
off anything in the room?

3720
02:49:53.351 --> 02:49:54.600
MATT: There is in the back of the chamber

3721
02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:56.790
behind her there is a slight magical essence

3722
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:58.670
in the corner but you don't see anything there.

3723
02:49:58.670 --> 02:50:02.550
TRAVIS: This is a beautiful shop. Is it just--

3724
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:05.020
MATT: "Why thank you, I appreciate it.

3725
02:50:08.708 --> 02:50:10.124
"What's your name, handsome?"

3726
02:50:10.124 --> 02:50:12.290
TRAVIS: Fjord.

3727
02:50:12.290 --> 02:50:13.950
MATT: Fjord! (chuckles)

3728
02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:17.080
Leans forward a bit. "My name is Maruo."

3729
02:50:17.080 --> 02:50:19.730
TRAVIS: Maruo, it is a pleasure to meet you

3730
02:50:19.730 --> 02:50:23.300
and thank you for welcoming us into your shop, Maruo.

3731
02:50:24.536 --> 02:50:25.735
LAURA: Maruo, do you live here?

3732
02:50:25.735 --> 02:50:26.568
MATT: "I do."

3733
02:50:26.568 --> 02:50:27.580
LAURA: Is that your house upstairs?

3734
02:50:27.580 --> 02:50:28.610
MATT: "It is."

3735
02:50:28.610 --> 02:50:29.443
LAURA: Cool.

3736
02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:31.800
TRAVIS: Just you?

3737
02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:33.310
MATT: "Just me.

3738
02:50:33.310 --> 02:50:34.710
"All by my lonesome."

3739
02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:35.932
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

3740
02:50:35.932 --> 02:50:37.048
MATT: "For now."

3741
02:50:37.048 --> 02:50:37.890
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

3742
02:50:37.890 --> 02:50:40.028
(laughter)

3743
02:50:41.333 --> 02:50:42.641
TRAVIS: Well, we are certainly

3744
02:50:42.641 --> 02:50:45.280
in the market for some of that oil

3745
02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:46.900
that you mentioned that would protect

3746
02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:49.340
some of our friends' fair skin.

3747
02:50:51.138 --> 02:50:52.496
LAURA: How much is that, also

3748
02:50:52.496 --> 02:50:53.790
the one that grows pretty hair?

3749
02:50:54.994 --> 02:50:57.643
MATT: "Well, for the skin cream and oil

3750
02:50:57.643 --> 02:51:00.518
"you'll looking for a single bottle

3751
02:51:00.518 --> 02:51:03.440
"will last you probably about a month.

3752
02:51:05.555 --> 02:51:07.150
"That one will run you about five gold pieces

3753
02:51:07.150 --> 02:51:10.210
"but it'll last you for a long time.

3754
02:51:11.985 --> 02:51:13.320
"Now for the shiny hair one,"

3755
02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:16.050
pulls up a small vial, fumbles it,

3756
02:51:17.348 --> 02:51:20.210
"There," and it has this weirdly viscous

3757
02:51:20.210 --> 02:51:23.580
yellowish brown tint to it.

3758
02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:25.703
"Just put a couple of drops in your

3759
02:51:25.703 --> 02:51:28.036
"morning coffee or your tea.

3760
02:51:30.511 --> 02:51:32.811
"This baby'll take you--ten gold for the vial."

3761
02:51:32.811 --> 02:51:34.417
LAURA: Ten gold?!

3762
02:51:34.417 --> 02:51:35.901
MATT: "But that'll last you for like a

3763
02:51:35.901 --> 02:51:37.590
"long time, so you're good."

3764
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:38.781
LAURA: That's a lot.

3765
02:51:38.781 --> 02:51:40.268
LIAM: It's just a jar of pee.

3766
02:51:40.268 --> 02:51:41.762
LAURA: Can I open it and sniff it?

3767
02:51:41.762 --> 02:51:43.761
MATT: Yeah. Smells fucking awful.

3768
02:51:43.761 --> 02:51:46.100
LAURA: Ugh. Is this specific to goblin hair

3769
02:51:46.100 --> 02:51:48.117
or is it for all people hair?

3770
02:51:48.117 --> 02:51:50.125
MATT: I haven't heard any complaints yet.

3771
02:51:52.578 --> 02:51:53.943
LAURA: Okay I'll buy it, here.

3772
02:51:53.943 --> 02:51:55.446
MATT: You get both of them?

3773
02:51:55.446 --> 02:51:56.487
Or just the hair?

3774
02:51:56.487 --> 02:51:57.330
LAURA: Just the hair.

3775
02:51:57.330 --> 02:51:59.970
MATT: "All right, ten gold, thank you very much.

3776
02:51:59.970 --> 02:52:01.345
"I appreciate your patronage."

3777
02:52:01.345 --> 02:52:02.586
TRAVIS: Surely there's more where that came from.

3778
02:52:02.586 --> 02:52:03.827
Tell me you got more.

3779
02:52:03.827 --> 02:52:05.270
MATT: "Oh yeah, I got whole bundles,

3780
02:52:05.270 --> 02:52:07.854
"you want them?" Puts like three more of them.

3781
02:52:07.854 --> 02:52:09.695
"What, are you storing up for the holidays?"

3782
02:52:09.695 --> 02:52:11.240
TRAVIS: That is great I--

3783
02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:12.670
TALIESIN: I think what our friend

3784
02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:15.220
was also asking is if you have anything

3785
02:52:15.220 --> 02:52:17.037
particularly special to show off,

3786
02:52:17.037 --> 02:52:19.192
I mean, something rare something unusual.

3787
02:52:19.192 --> 02:52:21.180
MATT: "Maybe."

3788
02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:23.162
TRAVIS: I sure would like to see

3789
02:52:23.162 --> 02:52:25.878
whatever you consider your speciality.

3790
02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:31.291
MATT: "Well," and she goes--

3791
02:52:31.291 --> 02:52:33.066
TALIESIN: Never okay again.

3792
02:52:33.066 --> 02:52:35.110
MATT: --takes up this small glass jar. You can see

3793
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:36.710
there's burlap pushed over it

3794
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:39.020
with a piece of twine

3795
02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:40.604
wrapped and tied around it.

3796
02:52:40.604 --> 02:52:45.040
She opens it up. "This is my special

3797
02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:47.570
"healing anti-chafing balm.

3798
02:52:49.253 --> 02:52:50.960
"Put it on the edges of joints,

3799
02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:55.380
"your elbows, your knees, also backs

3800
02:52:55.380 --> 02:52:58.270
"up if as in-need lubrication,

3801
02:52:58.270 --> 02:53:01.538
"but it'll just get you nice and greasy."

3802
02:53:01.538 --> 02:53:02.738
SAM: Cocoa butter?

3803
02:53:02.738 --> 02:53:07.715
TRAVIS: That's the that is the special specialty?

3804
02:53:08.934 --> 02:53:10.390
MATT: "Why, you looking for something else?"

3805
02:53:10.390 --> 02:53:12.348
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, just we've heard

3806
02:53:12.348 --> 02:53:13.696
so much about your establishment.

3807
02:53:13.696 --> 02:53:15.337
MATT: "What have you heard?"

3808
02:53:15.337 --> 02:53:17.220
TRAVIS: That there were wonders to behold

3809
02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:19.900
and the only way to find out exactly

3810
02:53:19.900 --> 02:53:22.390
what they were was to come here in-person.

3811
02:53:22.390 --> 02:53:24.807
MATT: Make a deception check.

3812
02:53:27.901 --> 02:53:30.782
TRAVIS: I have no powers. That's a natural one.

3813
02:53:30.782 --> 02:53:33.365
(laughter)

3814
02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:35.700
MATT: She gives you like a weird

3815
02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:39.322
once-over look and the expression drops a bit.

3816
02:53:41.767 --> 02:53:43.825
"Sorry, that's all I got!"

3817
02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:48.170
TRAVIS: You know, I have forgotten my money pouch.

3818
02:53:48.170 --> 02:53:50.450
I think you guys should just collect

3819
02:53:50.450 --> 02:53:52.980
as much as you can. I'll lean over

3820
02:53:52.980 --> 02:53:55.290
to Jester and go like: I will be over

3821
02:53:55.290 --> 02:53:56.990
at Wursh's place. I need to ask him

3822
02:53:56.990 --> 02:53:58.600
a few questions. You guys got this.

3823
02:53:58.600 --> 02:53:59.433
LAURA: Are you sure?

3824
02:53:59.433 --> 02:54:02.533
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, it's fine. And I'll head out.

3825
02:54:03.448 --> 02:54:04.281
MATT: "Do come back."

3826
02:54:04.281 --> 02:54:05.810
TRAVIS: Thank you for your time.

3827
02:54:05.810 --> 02:54:07.200
TALIESIN: He's been off all day.

3828
02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:09.770
LAURA: Yeah, he seems a little off, right?

3829
02:54:09.770 --> 02:54:10.603
TALIESIN: Just a little off.

3830
02:54:10.603 --> 02:54:13.070
TRAVIS: I'll head back towards.
TALIESIN: That's weird.

3831
02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:15.280
ASHLEY: I'm going to go follow him.

3832
02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:19.270
LAURA: While I'm going to give Caduceus

3833
02:54:19.270 --> 02:54:22.210
a little eye--oh wait, I don't even know

3834
02:54:22.210 --> 02:54:27.210
that you saw anything in the back.

3835
02:54:27.240 --> 02:54:28.810
TALIESIN: Do you ever deal in healing potions

3836
02:54:28.810 --> 02:54:30.925
or anything like that as well?

3837
02:54:30.925 --> 02:54:33.934
MATT: "I got maybe a couple, let me check.

3838
02:54:33.934 --> 02:54:36.790
"It takes a lot of time to make them."

3839
02:54:36.790 --> 02:54:38.015
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what.

3840
02:54:38.015 --> 02:54:39.798
We'll probably come back in. We've got a lot

3841
02:54:39.798 --> 02:54:41.260
of shopping to do, but it's good to know

3842
02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:42.551
that this place is here and I think

3843
02:54:42.551 --> 02:54:43.560
you'll be seeing more of us.

3844
02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:45.141
LAURA: What do you have in all these

3845
02:54:45.141 --> 02:54:46.480
boxes and crates and stuff?

3846
02:54:47.967 --> 02:54:48.973
MATT: "You know, just for the shipments

3847
02:54:48.973 --> 02:54:51.727
"we get in for supplies and, you know,

3848
02:54:52.777 --> 02:54:55.270
"just in case. You never know when you need them."

3849
02:54:55.270 --> 02:54:56.610
LAURA: That's true, that's true.

3850
02:54:56.610 --> 02:54:57.610
MATT: "Right?"

3851
02:54:57.610 --> 02:54:58.760
LAURA: Okay, well.

3852
02:54:59.633 --> 02:55:00.466
TALIESIN: Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

3853
02:55:00.466 --> 02:55:01.694
LAURA: Thank you for my hair oil.

3854
02:55:01.694 --> 02:55:02.796
MATT: "What's your name?"

3855
02:55:02.796 --> 02:55:03.776
TALIESIN: Clay.

3856
02:55:03.776 --> 02:55:05.142
MATT: "Clay! What's your name?"

3857
02:55:05.142 --> 02:55:06.382
LAURA: Fanny.

3858
02:55:06.382 --> 02:55:08.740
MATT: "Fanny, pleasure to meet you guys.

3859
02:55:08.740 --> 02:55:11.950
"Come back anytime!"

3860
02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:15.370
Legs go (thudding) on the table. "Son of a--"

3861
02:55:15.370 --> 02:55:18.000
and is now going back into this ingrown toenail.

3862
02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.000
TALIESIN: Something in the back

3863
02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:20.966
couldn't really make it out.

3864
02:55:20.966 --> 02:55:22.232
LAURA: Oh, you should've told me

3865
02:55:22.232 --> 02:55:23.240
I could've tried to distract her

3866
02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:25.803
while you got a better look.
TALIESIN: There was no way

3867
02:55:25.803 --> 02:55:27.380
I was going to get a better look.

3868
02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:28.988
LAURA: All right. Maybe some other time.

3869
02:55:28.988 --> 02:55:30.388
TALIESIN: Maybe some other time.

3870
02:55:30.388 --> 02:55:31.900
LAURA: I did get this really cool hair oil,

3871
02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:33.410
though, I can't wait to start using it.

3872
02:55:33.410 --> 02:55:34.830
TALIESIN: I'm looking forward to trying it.

3873
02:55:36.129 --> 02:55:37.136
MATT: In the meantime, while you guys

3874
02:55:37.136 --> 02:55:38.486
are having this conversation, you've rushed

3875
02:55:38.486 --> 02:55:41.070
outside into the rain and a few

3876
02:55:41.070 --> 02:55:42.730
moments later, you hear the pacing of Yasha

3877
02:55:42.730 --> 02:55:44.860
following behind as you begin to beeline.

3878
02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:45.970
ASHLEY: Mostly trailing him.

3879
02:55:45.970 --> 02:55:47.760
MATT: Okay.

3880
02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:51.921
ASHLEY: Have I noticed that he's unarmed?

3881
02:55:51.921 --> 02:55:53.430
MATT: He's usually unarmed.

3882
02:55:53.430 --> 02:55:54.530
ASHLEY: You are usually unarmed?

3883
02:55:54.530 --> 02:55:55.730
SAM: He summons his sword.

3884
02:55:55.730 --> 02:55:58.772
MATT: The sword lives in a pocket space.

3885
02:55:58.772 --> 02:56:01.043
LAURA: His sword lives inside of him.

3886
02:56:01.043 --> 02:56:03.543
(Matt laughs)

3887
02:56:04.770 --> 02:56:06.076
MATT: You're following Fjord.

3888
02:56:06.076 --> 02:56:08.526
Are you just keeping a distance to watch?

3889
02:56:09.777 --> 02:56:10.610
Or do you approach?

3890
02:56:10.610 --> 02:56:11.497
ASHLEY: I'm going to approach.

3891
02:56:11.497 --> 02:56:13.986
MATT: Okay. You hear Yasha come up from behind.

3892
02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:17.740
ASHLEY: I have to go there too, I'm sorry.

3893
02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:19.670
But I'll give you some time if you need to.

3894
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:21.190
TRAVIS: To Wursh's?

3895
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:22.440
ASHLEY: Yeah, just I want to ask him

3896
02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:24.450
about making something for me.

3897
02:56:24.450 --> 02:56:25.510
TRAVIS: You mentioned bracers.

3898
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:26.420
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3899
02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:29.399
TRAVIS: Yeah he, looks like he makes good stuff.

3900
02:56:31.774 --> 02:56:34.030
We should go there.

3901
02:56:34.030 --> 02:56:37.791
ASHLEY: Okay. Let's go there.

3902
02:56:37.791 --> 02:56:38.825
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3903
02:56:38.825 --> 02:56:41.593
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay.

3904
02:56:41.593 --> 02:56:43.467
MATT: You guys exit and you can see

3905
02:56:43.467 --> 02:56:46.290
back where you came, Fjord and Yasha

3906
02:56:46.290 --> 02:56:48.250
are quite a ways up, but they're heading

3907
02:56:48.250 --> 02:56:49.920
in the direction of the Hammered Call.

3908
02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:52.050
TRAVIS: As we're walking, do we see

3909
02:56:52.050 --> 02:56:54.690
any kind of temples in particular?

3910
02:56:54.690 --> 02:56:57.699
MATT: Make a perception check.

3911
02:56:57.699 --> 02:56:59.850
SAM: One.
TRAVIS: 20.

3912
02:56:59.850 --> 02:57:02.040
MATT: 20. There are no temples

3913
02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:06.194
or any structures that seem to mark

3914
02:57:06.194 --> 02:57:10.177
any sort of denomination. You do see small shrines.

3915
02:57:10.177 --> 02:57:12.976
You see on the mantles and above houses

3916
02:57:12.976 --> 02:57:17.976
and left by rain collection barrels

3917
02:57:18.430 --> 02:57:22.244
there's little shrines that have makeshift dodecahedrons,

3918
02:57:23.277 --> 02:57:24.869
and then a few other have a few other

3919
02:57:24.869 --> 02:57:27.450
strange sculptures that you don't necessarily recognize.

3920
02:57:27.450 --> 02:57:29.283
Make a religion check.

3921
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:33.910
TRAVIS: 12.

3922
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:36.628
MATT: 12. You're not sure what the smaller

3923
02:57:36.628 --> 02:57:39.005
idols and clay, matted sculptures are.

3924
02:57:39.005 --> 02:57:41.065
Iconography. It all seems pretty crude.

3925
02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:43.110
But it seems to be held or at least

3926
02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:45.350
placed in the same reverence or not necessarily

3927
02:57:45.350 --> 02:57:47.755
next to or sharing space with but you see

3928
02:57:47.755 --> 02:57:50.770
a couple, though, largely in the goblin

3929
02:57:50.770 --> 02:57:52.940
cluster home establishments.

3930
02:57:55.007 --> 02:57:59.607
They are definitely placed in a religious way.

3931
02:57:59.607 --> 02:58:01.870
TRAVIS: Great. Great.

3932
02:58:01.870 --> 02:58:03.710
MATT: You approach the exterior of the Hammered Call,

3933
02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:05.140
and you stop you can hear

3934
02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:10.098
in the inside the ting ting ting.

3935
02:58:13.390 --> 02:58:16.248
(water quenching)

3936
02:58:16.248 --> 02:58:18.420
TRAVIS: After you and I'll hold

3937
02:58:18.420 --> 02:58:20.278
out my hand and I'll try and cast

3938
02:58:20.278 --> 02:58:24.100
Minor Illusion just to make a little bird in my hand.

3939
02:58:25.668 --> 02:58:27.920
MATT: You concentrate on your hand...

3940
02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:29.511
nothing.

3941
02:58:29.511 --> 02:58:31.069
A little bird.

3942
02:58:31.069 --> 02:58:32.343
MARISHA and LAURA: (gasp)

3943
02:58:32.343 --> 02:58:35.000
SAM: Oh! Wait!

3944
02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:35.887
ASHLEY: Well, that was nice.

3945
02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:42.460
TRAVIS: Wasn't it? It really was.

3946
02:58:42.460 --> 02:58:46.082
I am glad we are here. After you.

3947
02:58:48.910 --> 02:58:49.923
ASHLEY: Hello.

3948
02:58:49.923 --> 02:58:52.185
MATT: You enter. You can see

3949
02:58:52.185 --> 02:58:57.184
the heavy muscled shoulders and back

3950
02:58:57.184 --> 02:59:00.217
of Wursh as he's sitting there hammering.

3951
02:59:00.217 --> 02:59:01.978
He's taking the metal back and actually

3952
02:59:01.978 --> 02:59:03.041
he's not hammering now. He's holding

3953
02:59:03.041 --> 02:59:04.836
it in the forge and you can see the metal

3954
02:59:04.836 --> 02:59:07.667
lighting up brighter and brighter orange,

3955
02:59:07.667 --> 02:59:08.808
and with his other hand

3956
02:59:08.808 --> 02:59:09.870
he sets down the hammer for a second

3957
02:59:09.870 --> 02:59:11.814
rubs his chin. Looks over.

3958
02:59:11.814 --> 02:59:14.880
"Hey, what I can do to help you?"

3959
02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:18.916
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm wondering if I could have

3960
02:59:18.916 --> 02:59:21.955
you make something for me?

3961
02:59:21.955 --> 02:59:23.390
MATT: "Maybe."

3962
02:59:23.390 --> 02:59:27.675
ASHLEY: I'm looking for bracers of some sort

3963
02:59:27.675 --> 02:59:30.550
for--I'm looking to

3964
02:59:32.208 --> 02:59:35.816
up my armor a little bit.

3965
02:59:36.925 --> 02:59:38.770
MATT: "I mean, I got all kinds of armor

3966
02:59:38.770 --> 02:59:41.540
"I can sell to you and make you.

3967
02:59:41.540 --> 02:59:43.780
"Bracers won't do much to protect you alone."

3968
02:59:45.820 --> 02:59:47.130
ASHLEY: Okay.

3969
02:59:47.130 --> 02:59:48.180
MATT: "But if you're looking for armor,

3970
02:59:48.180 --> 02:59:52.296
"I got breastplates, I got splint mail,

3971
02:59:52.296 --> 02:59:54.830
"I got ring mail, I got chain mail,

3972
02:59:54.830 --> 02:59:56.390
"whatever you're asking for.

3973
02:59:56.390 --> 02:59:57.440
"You just let me know.

3974
02:59:58.390 --> 02:59:59.223
"Oh hey."

3975
03:00:00.379 --> 03:00:01.970
TRAVIS: Hey, Wursh.

3976
03:00:01.970 --> 03:00:03.450
MATT: "Fjord was it, right?"

3977
03:00:03.450 --> 03:00:04.390
TRAVIS: You got it.

3978
03:00:04.390 --> 03:00:06.150
MATT: "Good to see you again."

3979
03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:08.210
TRAVIS: You too. I wanted to thank you

3980
03:00:08.210 --> 03:00:13.210
for your words the last time we met. I, um--

3981
03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:16.080
MATT: He sets the metal aside, letting it cool.

3982
03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:19.527
TRAVIS: I confess, I have a bit of temper

3983
03:00:19.527 --> 03:00:23.800
when it comes to people talking about our kind.

3984
03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:25.830
MATT: "It's okay. Our kind has a temper."

3985
03:00:27.027 --> 03:00:28.190
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've fought against it

3986
03:00:28.190 --> 03:00:30.415
my whole life. You...

3987
03:00:31.606 --> 03:00:32.440
caught me on the spot.

3988
03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:35.830
I haven't ever sort of talked about

3989
03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:38.409
that sort of stuff nor have I been around

3990
03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:41.200
our kind that much.

3991
03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:44.250
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?

3992
03:00:44.250 --> 03:00:45.380
MATT: Looks over to Yasha, looks

3993
03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:46.760
to the rest of the empty room.

3994
03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:49.370
As soon as Jester and Caduceus step

3995
03:00:49.370 --> 03:00:53.440
into the doorway he goes, "Depending."

3996
03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:55.430
TRAVIS: Yeah, if it's a bad timing.

3997
03:00:56.320 --> 03:00:58.020
ASHLEY: I'm going to step outside.

3998
03:00:59.230 --> 03:01:00.633
TALIESIN: What are you--?
LAURA: What is going on?

3999
03:01:00.633 --> 03:01:02.916
ASHLEY: We just--I remembered

4000
03:01:02.916 --> 03:01:04.324
I want to show you guys something outside.

4001
03:01:04.324 --> 03:01:05.409
LAURA: Okay.

4002
03:01:05.409 --> 03:01:07.627
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.

4003
03:01:07.627 --> 03:01:08.700
MATT: The three of them leave

4004
03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:10.930
and it's just the two of you.

4005
03:01:10.930 --> 03:01:12.988
TRAVIS: Uh. I...

4006
03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:18.130
I grew up around humans and half-elves mostly.

4007
03:01:19.556 --> 03:01:22.240
You said you grew up with more of our race,

4008
03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:23.680
is that right?

4009
03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:25.130
MATT: "Yeah, I'm Boroftkrah."

4010
03:01:27.570 --> 03:01:30.841
TRAVIS: Were they accepting of you,

4011
03:01:32.558 --> 03:01:35.900
welcoming our kind?

4012
03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:37.950
MATT: "They had to be, when I got to a certain age,"

4013
03:01:37.950 --> 03:01:39.897
and he cracks his wrists.

4014
03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:43.130
"Even I wasn't as big as some.

4015
03:01:43.130 --> 03:01:45.820
"We were accepting. That's why I stayed in Boroftkrah.

4016
03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:49.520
"They were proud people and good people,

4017
03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:52.590
"but we weren't the only orc clan

4018
03:01:52.590 --> 03:01:55.850
"in the Wildlands and others tended

4019
03:01:55.850 --> 03:01:57.450
"to lean into their violent side."

4020
03:01:58.805 --> 03:02:00.810
TRAVIS: Yeah, I only heard stories

4021
03:02:00.810 --> 03:02:04.066
about that wild side. It was what most people

4022
03:02:04.066 --> 03:02:07.110
expected my reaction to be, one of anger

4023
03:02:07.110 --> 03:02:09.650
and rage and violence.

4024
03:02:09.650 --> 03:02:11.800
MATT: "I tell you what.

4025
03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:15.480
"I've been to a few Empire establishments

4026
03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:16.840
"on making my way south,

4027
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:20.700
"looking like the way I do.

4028
03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:23.930
"I've seen some orcs do some terrible things.

4029
03:02:23.930 --> 03:02:26.020
"I've seen them be violent and angry.

4030
03:02:26.930 --> 03:02:27.763
"Unfair.

4031
03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:32.900
"But hell if I haven't seen plenty of humans,

4032
03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:36.868
"dwarves, elves, half-elves be the exact same.

4033
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:42.817
"It's all perspective. It's all about the other."

4034
03:02:43.910 --> 03:02:47.620
TRAVIS: When they look at you in that way--

4035
03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:50.760
granted, you are a fucking ten-ton truck--

4036
03:02:51.968 --> 03:02:55.725
what do you do? Shake it off?

4037
03:02:55.725 --> 03:02:57.688
Give them a look?

4038
03:02:58.690 --> 03:02:59.990
MATT: "Both. (chuckles)

4039
03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:03.970
"You pick and choose your fights.

4040
03:03:03.970 --> 03:03:08.970
"Me? Best not give in to a man I can crush with one hand."

4041
03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:11.370
TRAVIS: Right.

4042
03:03:11.370 --> 03:03:13.720
MATT: "Besides, most of them are just bluster.

4043
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:17.460
"The ones that draw blades you can see,

4044
03:03:17.460 --> 03:03:19.600
"the ones that mean to cut and you just

4045
03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:21.600
"keep on moving."

4046
03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:23.163
TRAVIS: Are you happy here?

4047
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:25.566
MATT: "For now.

4048
03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:28.680
"Been here long enough to say at least

4049
03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:30.210
"it's comfortable. I like being where

4050
03:03:30.210 --> 03:03:32.674
"I can do my shopping and walk through the streets

4051
03:03:32.674 --> 03:03:34.930
"without too much of a hassle.

4052
03:03:36.097 --> 03:03:37.590
"Don't know if I take too kindly

4053
03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:42.587
"to this intensely religious atmosphere."

4054
03:03:44.055 --> 03:03:47.310
TRAVIS: What do you mean, around their thing?

4055
03:03:48.300 --> 03:03:49.900
MATT: "Yeah, just not my speed.

4056
03:03:50.970 --> 03:03:55.330
"They don't push it on you, but it's annoying."

4057
03:03:55.330 --> 03:03:56.690
TRAVIS: They talk about it all the time,

4058
03:03:56.690 --> 03:03:59.580
or just fervent worship, or?

4059
03:03:59.580 --> 03:04:02.490
MATT: "Yeah, just checking to see if you're

4060
03:04:02.490 --> 03:04:05.880
"interested in coming to one of their little gatherings."

4061
03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:10.505
TRAVIS: What kind of gatherings?

4062
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:13.776
MATT: "Firmaments by the various

4063
03:04:13.776 --> 03:04:16.590
"high glass temples and such."

4064
03:04:16.590 --> 03:04:19.330
TRAVIS: They hold regular meetings?

4065
03:04:20.250 --> 03:04:25.250
MATT: "Not regular. You know the shade above us?"

4066
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:26.580
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4067
03:04:26.580 --> 03:04:29.120
MATT: "They let that slip every now and then."

4068
03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:30.010
TRAVIS: They do?

4069
03:04:30.010 --> 03:04:31.920
MATT: "Let some sunlight in.

4070
03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:33.180
"Those are the holy days."

4071
03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:37.540
TRAVIS: What happens when the sun is let in?

4072
03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:39.136
MATT: "Everyone comes out and takes

4073
03:04:39.136 --> 03:04:44.020
"their time in the light and let me tell you,

4074
03:04:44.020 --> 03:04:45.950
"it's funny seeing the bunch of them

4075
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:47.840
"dark elves out there and force themselves

4076
03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:50.790
"in the sun for some whispers and worship.

4077
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:53.870
"All bleedy eyed and enduring it,

4078
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:57.760
"but it's part of how they do their prayer, I guess."

4079
03:04:57.760 --> 03:04:59.560
TRAVIS: Bet that's good for a laugh, yeah?

4080
03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:01.230
MATT: "It is, but it means something to them.

4081
03:05:01.230 --> 03:05:04.680
"That's fine. It's not for me."

4082
03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:07.410
TRAVIS: Do they do that every few days,

4083
03:05:07.410 --> 03:05:09.370
once a week, do you know?

4084
03:05:09.370 --> 03:05:10.910
MATT: "I don't pay too much attention.

4085
03:05:10.910 --> 03:05:14.900
"Weeks, months, depends on the clouds.

4086
03:05:15.850 --> 03:05:17.390
"Storm right now, probably won't happen

4087
03:05:17.390 --> 03:05:18.350
"any time soon."

4088
03:05:18.350 --> 03:05:22.103
TRAVIS: Sure. I appreciate you

4089
03:05:22.103 --> 03:05:24.770
extending a kind word. You didn't have to do that,

4090
03:05:24.770 --> 03:05:26.720
and it's been a while, so thank you.

4091
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:29.760
MATT: "Sorry for calling you runt."

4092
03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:34.760
TRAVIS: It's apt. Present company included.

4093
03:05:36.265 --> 03:05:39.060
Do me a favor: take care of my friend outside.

4094
03:05:39.060 --> 03:05:42.355
She is a gentle giant.

4095
03:05:44.780 --> 03:05:47.250
MATT: "Send her back in and I'll see what I can do."

4096
03:05:47.250 --> 03:05:48.950
TRAVIS: Will do. And I'll go out.

4097
03:05:50.017 --> 03:05:50.850
Hey, Yasha.

4098
03:05:51.684 --> 03:05:53.570
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Think he's got some

4099
03:05:53.570 --> 03:05:55.100
think he's got some good stuff.

4100
03:05:55.100 --> 03:05:55.933
ASHLEY: Okay.

4101
03:05:55.933 --> 03:05:57.700
TRAVIS: Thanks for giving me a second.

4102
03:05:57.700 --> 03:05:59.700
ASHLEY: Yeah, of course.

4103
03:05:59.700 --> 03:06:02.610
MATT: You guys all come in with Yasha?

4104
03:06:02.610 --> 03:06:03.443
LAURA: Yeah.

4105
03:06:03.443 --> 03:06:05.173
MATT: You come in as well or do you stay outside?

4106
03:06:05.173 --> 03:06:06.006
TRAVIS: No, I stay outside.

4107
03:06:07.044 --> 03:06:08.341
TALIESIN: I'll stay outside for a second as well.

4108
03:06:08.341 --> 03:06:10.000
MATT: Okay, so Jester and Yasha, you come in.

4109
03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:11.300
He looks over to you and goes,

4110
03:06:11.300 --> 03:06:12.880
"Like I said, I can make you bracers.

4111
03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:14.330
"They're not going to do much to protect you

4112
03:06:14.330 --> 03:06:16.750
"without some of them fiddling magic stuff,

4113
03:06:16.750 --> 03:06:19.849
"but at the very least, they'll be nice.

4114
03:06:19.849 --> 03:06:24.200
"They might suit your toughened wrists."

4115
03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:26.530
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm trying to think

4116
03:06:26.530 --> 03:06:27.860
if that's enough. I'm trying to think

4117
03:06:27.860 --> 03:06:31.279
of what I can wear?

4118
03:06:31.279 --> 03:06:32.752
LAURA: You know what could work?

4119
03:06:32.752 --> 03:06:35.350
I've heard of like rings that help

4120
03:06:35.350 --> 03:06:39.630
protect you. It's like a shield almost,

4121
03:06:39.630 --> 03:06:40.910
an enchanted ring.

4122
03:06:40.910 --> 03:06:41.743
ASHLEY: Yeah?

4123
03:06:41.743 --> 03:06:43.880
LAURA: Yeah, I've seen them before.

4124
03:06:43.880 --> 03:06:45.280
MATT: Bracers aren't considered armor.

4125
03:06:45.280 --> 03:06:47.304
They do not improve your armor class,

4126
03:06:48.354 --> 03:06:52.710
but they're there for show and just to have

4127
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:56.901
for flavor, but you can have them enchanted

4128
03:06:56.901 --> 03:06:59.130
to be more protective, should you find

4129
03:06:59.130 --> 03:07:02.713
somebody who can do that and you pay them to do so.

4130
03:07:08.660 --> 03:07:10.860
"Gold piece for the bracers?"

4131
03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:13.510
ASHLEY: I don't know if those are what I need, then.

4132
03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:15.170
LAURA: Well, you could always take the bracers

4133
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:16.890
and maybe we can find somebody?

4134
03:07:16.890 --> 03:07:19.440
ASHLEY: Yeah, how much do you charge for that?

4135
03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:21.290
MATT: "For the bracers, a gold piece."

4136
03:07:21.290 --> 03:07:23.140
ASHLEY: A gold piece?
MATT: "I just told you, yeah."

4137
03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:25.520
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, I'm so sorry.

4138
03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:27.430
Yeah, I will buy some of those

4139
03:07:28.707 --> 03:07:29.857
and maybe see if I can.

4140
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:32.910
MATT: "Let me go and take some measurements,"

4141
03:07:32.910 --> 03:07:34.700
and he comes over measures your wrist

4142
03:07:34.700 --> 03:07:39.119
and your forearm, "Pretty meaty for a human.

4143
03:07:39.119 --> 03:07:40.360
"All due respect."

4144
03:07:41.654 --> 03:07:44.421
ASHLEY: Well, I work out a lot.

4145
03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:50.651
MATT: "Come back--give me a couple hours."

4146
03:07:50.651 --> 03:07:51.757
ASHLEY: Okay.

4147
03:07:51.757 --> 03:07:53.430
MATT: "Should have something fashioned for you by then.

4148
03:07:53.430 --> 03:07:55.100
"This is just a piece of practice material

4149
03:07:55.100 --> 03:07:57.030
"I can fashion you something nice."

4150
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:58.801
ASHLEY: Thank you very much.

4151
03:07:58.801 --> 03:08:00.968
MATT: "No worries. You want anything?"

4152
03:08:00.968 --> 03:08:02.017
LAURA: No.

4153
03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:04.613
MATT: "Okay."

4154
03:08:06.300 --> 03:08:07.700
LAURA: What were you saying to our friend?

4155
03:08:07.700 --> 03:08:09.300
Were you being nice?

4156
03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:12.160
MATT: "We were having a frank conversation,

4157
03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:14.458
"passing by. Why?"

4158
03:08:14.458 --> 03:08:15.716
LAURA: I was just wondering.

4159
03:08:15.716 --> 03:08:20.010
He sometimes, I don't know, he hasn't

4160
03:08:20.010 --> 03:08:21.898
really been around a lot of people

4161
03:08:21.898 --> 03:08:26.260
that are like him, so I hope you're being nice.

4162
03:08:27.330 --> 03:08:28.580
MATT: "I'm being me; I don't

4163
03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:31.654
"know if that's nice or not. That's all I know."

4164
03:08:31.654 --> 03:08:33.770
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "He's got a good heart."

4165
03:08:33.770 --> 03:08:34.603
LAURA: I know.

4166
03:08:35.690 --> 03:08:38.620
MATT: "Careful. Good hearts don't do well

4167
03:08:38.620 --> 03:08:39.670
"in times of conflict."

4168
03:08:43.922 --> 03:08:44.760
He takes the metal prongs

4169
03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:46.770
and starts heating it in the forge once more.

4170
03:08:49.180 --> 03:08:50.840
LAURA: Okay, well, we'll come back then.

4171
03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:52.371
ASHLEY: We'll come back.

4172
03:08:52.371 --> 03:08:54.055
MATT: "A few hours and it'll be done, I promise."

4173
03:08:54.055 --> 03:08:55.650
ASHLEY: Okay, thank you, Wursh.

4174
03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:00.105
LAURA: Did you see his abs, though?

4175
03:09:00.105 --> 03:09:01.748
ASHLEY: He's massive.

4176
03:09:01.748 --> 03:09:03.259
LAURA: I mean.

4177
03:09:03.259 --> 03:09:06.167
ASHLEY: There were so many muscles.

4178
03:09:06.167 --> 03:09:07.737
A lot of them.

4179
03:09:07.737 --> 03:09:10.670
I have to go to one more place for

4180
03:09:11.720 --> 03:09:13.730
Caleb.

4181
03:09:13.730 --> 03:09:16.170
Would you guys mind? I need to go to a dress shop.

4182
03:09:16.170 --> 03:09:17.280
LAURA: He needs to buy a dress?

4183
03:09:17.280 --> 03:09:18.640
ASHLEY: No, just clothes, you know.

4184
03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:20.110
LAURA: I mean, it's cool if he does,

4185
03:09:20.110 --> 03:09:21.030
I just didn't know.

4186
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:22.640
ASHLEY: Is there a clothing shop nearby?

4187
03:09:22.640 --> 03:09:23.850
That I can run in very quickly.

4188
03:09:23.850 --> 03:09:25.820
MATT: Not immediately nearby,

4189
03:09:25.820 --> 03:09:28.600
but after a short 20 minute search,

4190
03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:32.100
you find a place that sells standard garments.

4191
03:09:32.100 --> 03:09:33.870
These aren't fine upper class garments,

4192
03:09:33.870 --> 03:09:37.850
but these are general clothing, pieces of attire.

4193
03:09:37.850 --> 03:09:38.950
LAURA: What does he want?

4194
03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:42.253
ASHLEY: Well, he gave me this list.

4195
03:09:42.253 --> 03:09:45.610
I show her the parchment.

4196
03:09:45.610 --> 03:09:46.590
LAURA: What does it say?

4197
03:09:48.217 --> 03:09:49.050
ASHLEY: Do you want me to read it?

4198
03:09:49.050 --> 03:09:49.883
LIAM: Sure.

4199
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:53.700
ASHLEY: Dark muted purple coat that's fur-lined.

4200
03:09:53.700 --> 03:09:54.533
LAURA: Whoa!

4201
03:09:56.368 --> 03:09:57.671
ASHLEY: New boots.

4202
03:09:57.671 --> 03:09:58.950
LAURA: New boots, he could use some.

4203
03:09:58.950 --> 03:10:00.690
ASHLEY: Dark charcoal gray

4204
03:10:00.690 --> 03:10:03.240
in the Kryn style breeches and shirt.

4205
03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:04.560
LAURA: Cool.

4206
03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:07.370
ASHLEY: And these are his exact measurements.

4207
03:10:07.370 --> 03:10:10.664
LAURA: Good to know.
ASHLEY: 36-24-36.

4208
03:10:10.664 --> 03:10:14.071
(laughter)

4209
03:10:14.071 --> 03:10:16.431
MATT: He's also 5'3"; it's crazy!

4210
03:10:16.431 --> 03:10:18.752
TRAVIS: Thank you!

4211
03:10:18.752 --> 03:10:19.585
One second.

4212
03:10:20.779 --> 03:10:23.722
Only if she's 5'3"

4213
03:10:23.722 --> 03:10:25.640
ASHLEY: For the sake of brevity.

4214
03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:28.988
MATT: Yeah, okay, so for those custom outfits,

4215
03:10:28.988 --> 03:10:30.450
it'll take a few days.

4216
03:10:30.450 --> 03:10:31.855
ASHLEY: Okay.

4217
03:10:31.855 --> 03:10:33.890
MATT: I'll say for the full ensemble there

4218
03:10:35.550 --> 03:10:38.290
it'll run you about ten gold pieces.

4219
03:10:38.290 --> 03:10:39.200
ASHLEY: Perfect.

4220
03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:41.023
Okay.

4221
03:10:42.696 --> 03:10:44.240
MATT: They'll be made with fine materials.

4222
03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:45.073
ASHLEY: Okay.

4223
03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:47.640
LAURA: I guess, yeah, that means

4224
03:10:47.640 --> 03:10:51.310
that we were going to buy some stuff.

4225
03:10:51.310 --> 03:10:52.143
LIAM: I thought you did?

4226
03:10:52.143 --> 03:10:54.140
LAURA: Yeah, but they were being custom

4227
03:10:54.140 --> 03:10:55.280
made, too, so they're probably only

4228
03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:56.990
getting ready about now.

4229
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:58.620
MATT: Yeah, been a few enough days.

4230
03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:01.006
LAURA: Sweet, so we'll pick up our stuff then.

4231
03:11:01.006 --> 03:11:04.010
MATT: Do you guys go and regather?

4232
03:11:04.010 --> 03:11:04.960
TALIESIN: I'm giving him the eye

4233
03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:06.064
the entire time, but yeah.

4234
03:11:06.064 --> 03:11:07.517
MATT: Okay.

4235
03:11:08.626 --> 03:11:09.696
TRAVIS: <i>Moi</i>?

4236
03:11:09.696 --> 03:11:11.051
MATT: All right, you guys make your way back

4237
03:11:11.051 --> 03:11:13.622
to gather at the Dim's Inn.

4238
03:11:13.622 --> 03:11:14.797
LAURA: Ooh! I'm wearing my new coat,

4239
03:11:14.797 --> 03:11:16.720
and my new dress. I'm spinning in circles

4240
03:11:16.720 --> 03:11:21.490
so everyone can see it.

4241
03:11:21.490 --> 03:11:23.010
MATT: As you guys meet up inside

4242
03:11:23.010 --> 03:11:25.806
and gather and discuss what happened,

4243
03:11:25.806 --> 03:11:29.080
a voice from the head of the inn goes,

4244
03:11:30.520 --> 03:11:32.990
"Well, word seems to be saying that you've

4245
03:11:32.990 --> 03:11:36.348
"done very well lately."

4246
03:11:36.348 --> 03:11:37.780
You turn and look and there you see

4247
03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:41.460
Shadowhand Essek Thelyss is there in the doorway.

4248
03:11:41.460 --> 03:11:45.150
Goes, "Well done! You have done quite

4249
03:11:46.504 --> 03:11:49.072
"a quite a nice thing.

4250
03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:53.360
"Well, I apologize for the intrusion,

4251
03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:56.286
"do you have a moment for your time, please?"

4252
03:11:56.286 --> 03:11:58.240
TRAVIS: Of course, Slow-Mo. What was on your mind?

4253
03:11:59.196 --> 03:12:01.696
(Matt laughs)

4254
03:12:03.431 --> 03:12:06.739
MATT: He says, "Well,

4255
03:12:07.831 --> 03:12:10.439
"let's just say that we've been very

4256
03:12:10.439 --> 03:12:12.455
"happy with what you guys

4257
03:12:12.455 --> 03:12:14.930
"have done for both the Bright Queen

4258
03:12:14.930 --> 03:12:19.710
"and the good professor. I hear that it fared well.

4259
03:12:19.710 --> 03:12:22.590
"Because of these deeds under of the light of the Luxon--

4260
03:12:23.730 --> 03:12:27.180
"and don't think that Den Thelyss has not noticed this--

4261
03:12:29.015 --> 03:12:31.200
"and we would not dare have you stay

4262
03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:35.090
"as friends of the Bright Queen

4263
03:12:35.090 --> 03:12:38.260
"in such a--" and he leans in away from the earshot

4264
03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:42.920
of Gaben, "such a lowly establishment.

4265
03:12:42.920 --> 03:12:46.531
"While you were gone, we have secured for you

4266
03:12:46.531 --> 03:12:48.632
"an abode within the Firmaments."

4267
03:12:48.632 --> 03:12:50.060
(Laura gasps)

4268
03:12:50.060 --> 03:12:51.620
"It's already furnished and ready.

4269
03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:55.290
"There's even a pen for your beasts."

4270
03:12:55.290 --> 03:12:56.382
LAURA: Really?

4271
03:12:56.382 --> 03:12:57.604
TALIESIN: That is very generous.

4272
03:12:57.604 --> 03:13:00.895
SAM: Is it like an Airbnb or something?

4273
03:13:00.895 --> 03:13:02.400
Like, do we have to pay for it?

4274
03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:04.200
MATT: "No, no, it is being provided."

4275
03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:07.920
LAURA: You guys are giving us a house?

4276
03:13:07.920 --> 03:13:09.925
MATT: "Well, you've given us hope

4277
03:13:09.925 --> 03:13:14.596
"and helped lessen the terrible impact

4278
03:13:14.596 --> 03:13:16.235
"of what the Empire has wrought

4279
03:13:16.235 --> 03:13:18.585
"on us, so it's the very least we could do."

4280
03:13:18.585 --> 03:13:20.650
TRAVIS: That is most welcome.

4281
03:13:20.650 --> 03:13:22.620
And very generous.

4282
03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:23.820
LAURA: Yes, thank you.

4283
03:13:25.130 --> 03:13:26.220
MATT: "Would you like to see it?"

4284
03:13:26.220 --> 03:13:27.380
LAURA and SAM: Yes!

4285
03:13:27.380 --> 03:13:28.540
LAURA: Let's just go upstairs

4286
03:13:28.540 --> 03:13:30.152
and we'll gather our things, okay?

4287
03:13:30.152 --> 03:13:31.977
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll just grab our stuff real quick.

4288
03:13:31.977 --> 03:13:33.230
MATT: "Of course. I will wait for you outside."

4289
03:13:33.230 --> 03:13:34.063
LAURA: Okay.

4290
03:13:35.486 --> 03:13:38.160
MATT: He drifts out of the inn.

4291
03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:41.070
LAURA: How does he do that?

4292
03:13:41.070 --> 03:13:42.960
SAM: Maybe he's wearing wheels.

4293
03:13:44.102 --> 03:13:45.952
MATT: He's got Wheelies.

4294
03:13:45.952 --> 03:13:47.854
SAM: He's got a Segway.

4295
03:13:48.789 --> 03:13:50.222
TRAVIS: Can I run up the stairs

4296
03:13:50.222 --> 03:13:52.330
to the room real fast and as soon as I get

4297
03:13:52.330 --> 03:13:56.037
in there, can I try and summon the sword?

4298
03:13:56.037 --> 03:13:58.804
MATT: (gust of wind) It appears in your grip.

4299
03:13:58.804 --> 03:13:59.637
TRAVIS: Can I make it go away?

4300
03:13:59.637 --> 03:14:00.470
MATT: Yep.

4301
03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:02.620
MARISHA: Oh, he's fucking with you.

4302
03:14:02.620 --> 03:14:04.310
LIAM: He's fucking with you.

4303
03:14:04.310 --> 03:14:05.260
MARISHA: Oh no.

4304
03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:07.090
LIAM: You know he can fuck with you.

4305
03:14:09.703 --> 03:14:11.645
TRAVIS: Ready to go.

4306
03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:17.320
MATT: Yeza's like, "We have a house here now?"

4307
03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:19.700
SAM: I mean, we're not going to stay for very long,

4308
03:14:19.700 --> 03:14:22.270
but for right now, I don't know

4309
03:14:22.270 --> 03:14:24.640
how to get us away from here.

4310
03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:25.770
MATT: "I know, I understand.

4311
03:14:25.770 --> 03:14:27.220
"It's just the--wow, it's a lot."

4312
03:14:28.210 --> 03:14:31.690
SAM: Yeah. Crazy things happen with these guys.

4313
03:14:31.690 --> 03:14:32.523
MATT: "Apparently."

4314
03:14:32.523 --> 03:14:33.590
SAM: All the time.

4315
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:37.140
MATT: "You've made some unique friends."

4316
03:14:37.140 --> 03:14:38.548
SAM: I sure have.

4317
03:14:38.548 --> 03:14:39.600
MATT: "I like them."

4318
03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:42.350
SAM: Yeah? Who's your favorite?

4319
03:14:42.350 --> 03:14:44.560
MATT: "Oh, I don't know, they're all pretty nice."

4320
03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:45.910
SAM: They're really not.

4321
03:14:47.460 --> 03:14:49.630
MATT: "I like the tall guy,"

4322
03:14:49.630 --> 03:14:51.110
and points over to Caduceus.

4323
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:55.030
SAM: He's mysterious. Yeah and wise.

4324
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:58.375
MATT: "His energy's more palatable."

4325
03:14:58.375 --> 03:14:59.208
SAM: Mm-hmm.

4326
03:15:00.380 --> 03:15:03.098
TALIESIN: (choking and coughing)

4327
03:15:03.098 --> 03:15:05.592
(laughter)

4328
03:15:05.592 --> 03:15:06.425
I'm okay. (coughing)

4329
03:15:07.890 --> 03:15:10.270
MATT: "He'd fit in right in Felderwin, he would."

4330
03:15:11.277 --> 03:15:13.105
SAM: Except for the tall thing.

4331
03:15:13.105 --> 03:15:15.450
MATT: "Well, you know that's fine."

4332
03:15:15.450 --> 03:15:16.710
SAM: Anyway, let's go check it out

4333
03:15:16.710 --> 03:15:18.770
and you know what? A safe place

4334
03:15:18.770 --> 03:15:21.070
to just sort of wait. Also, maybe tonight

4335
03:15:21.070 --> 03:15:23.280
before bed, we can ask Jester to check

4336
03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:24.570
in on the boy.

4337
03:15:24.570 --> 03:15:28.123
MATT: "I would love that. Can we do that? Okay.

4338
03:15:28.123 --> 03:15:30.270
"I'll grab what--I don't have anything,

4339
03:15:30.270 --> 03:15:31.990
"what am I saying. I'm good to go."

4340
03:15:33.679 --> 03:15:35.600
The rest of you guys gather your things.

4341
03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:38.586
LAURA: I give Beau her new clothes.

4342
03:15:38.586 --> 03:15:40.319
MARISHA: Ooh!
LAURA: Yeah.

4343
03:15:40.319 --> 03:15:43.100
MARISHA: It's one of Avantika's coats.

4344
03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:44.945
Got it fur-lined.

4345
03:15:47.286 --> 03:15:49.152
Does it look good? Does it look

4346
03:15:49.152 --> 03:15:49.985
like I killed a pirate?

4347
03:15:49.985 --> 03:15:50.940
LAURA: It looks pretty much the same

4348
03:15:50.940 --> 03:15:54.720
as her coat before, but now it's warm.

4349
03:15:54.720 --> 03:15:56.197
Pretty cool.

4350
03:15:56.197 --> 03:15:57.438
LIAM: Yeah, it's very dashing.

4351
03:15:57.438 --> 03:15:58.840
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you.

4352
03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:01.086
Still smells like her a little bit.

4353
03:16:01.086 --> 03:16:03.232
LAURA and TALIESIN: (groaning)
TALIESIN: That's weird.

4354
03:16:03.232 --> 03:16:04.862
MARISHA: That's nice.
TALIESIN: Is it?

4355
03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:08.500
MATT: As you guys are exiting the inn,

4356
03:16:08.500 --> 03:16:11.071
Gaben in the back goes, "So you're leaving us,

4357
03:16:11.071 --> 03:16:13.830
"if I am to hear correctly?"

4358
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:15.957
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: "Well, it's been fun."

4359
03:16:15.957 --> 03:16:17.090
LAURA: Yes, it's been great.

4360
03:16:17.090 --> 03:16:18.491
MATT: "Goodbye."

4361
03:16:18.491 --> 03:16:20.660
LIAM: Thank you, for being so gracious

4362
03:16:20.660 --> 03:16:23.090
with our animals and I place five gold

4363
03:16:23.090 --> 03:16:26.710
on the counter.

4364
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:29.210
MATT: "Well, I appreciate your patronage

4365
03:16:30.750 --> 03:16:33.750
"and paying me... for once."

4366
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:35.700
LIAM: Oh, are we behind? I'm sorry.

4367
03:16:36.706 --> 03:16:40.297
MATT: "No, it was being paid for by

4368
03:16:40.297 --> 03:16:42.980
"the Den Kryn,

4369
03:16:42.980 --> 03:16:46.328
"so it's fine. It was a favor."

4370
03:16:46.328 --> 03:16:48.563
LIAM: Let's make it ten.

4371
03:16:49.950 --> 03:16:51.323
MATT: "I won't argue."

4372
03:16:51.323 --> 03:16:52.308
LIAM: Appreciate, it thank you.

4373
03:16:52.308 --> 03:16:55.391
MATT: He scoops the ten gold, puts it away.

4374
03:16:55.391 --> 03:16:56.510
"Humans."

4375
03:16:56.510 --> 03:17:00.870
LAURA: Would you like a tattoo as payment

4376
03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:03.090
for my room?

4377
03:17:03.090 --> 03:17:04.760
MATT: "No, I'm fine, thank you."

4378
03:17:04.760 --> 03:17:06.000
LAURA: I'm sure the Bright Queen

4379
03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:09.320
would appreciate it if you would take my favor.

4380
03:17:09.320 --> 03:17:12.180
MATT: "I would think not, but I appreciate

4381
03:17:12.180 --> 03:17:16.670
"your being so generous."

4382
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:18.330
LAURA: All right, I'll let her know

4383
03:17:18.330 --> 03:17:20.670
you denied it.

4384
03:17:20.670 --> 03:17:23.170
(Matt laughs)

4385
03:17:25.820 --> 03:17:27.252
MATT: You guys exit out

4386
03:17:27.252 --> 03:17:29.727
and you retrieve your moorbounders,

4387
03:17:29.727 --> 03:17:31.860
and waiting for you standing there,

4388
03:17:31.860 --> 03:17:34.520
wide shoulder mantle cloak swaying.

4389
03:17:34.520 --> 03:17:37.830
The rain seems to like fall, but you never see

4390
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:41.420
it scatter across the shadowhand.

4391
03:17:41.420 --> 03:17:45.220
It seems to drift around.

4392
03:17:45.220 --> 03:17:47.320
He stays dry amongst the storm.

4393
03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:49.490
MARISHA: That's so goth.

4394
03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:51.040
TRAVIS: Is the water that's moving around

4395
03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:53.203
moving slowly or is it just

4396
03:17:53.203 --> 03:17:54.387
kind of moving around?

4397
03:17:54.387 --> 03:17:56.730
MATT: No, it's just drifting off.

4398
03:17:56.730 --> 03:17:59.400
LAURA: I put the collar that I bought

4399
03:17:59.400 --> 03:18:02.500
around Yarnball. I had the dressmaker

4400
03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:05.040
make a collar that matches my cloak.

4401
03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:06.320
MATT: There you go.

4402
03:18:06.320 --> 03:18:08.950
LIAM: Oh, also bring the staff over.

4403
03:18:08.950 --> 03:18:10.640
SAM: Oh yes, yes.

4404
03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:13.270
LIAM: Caduceus--and as we walk, I hand it to him.

4405
03:18:13.270 --> 03:18:14.780
SAM: What about the sword thing?

4406
03:18:14.780 --> 03:18:16.055
LIAM: We have that in the bag.

4407
03:18:16.055 --> 03:18:17.296
SAM: Hold it up to the sword!

4408
03:18:17.296 --> 03:18:18.930
LIAM: Let's get to where our new digs are

4409
03:18:18.930 --> 03:18:22.942
and I slide the ring on.

4410
03:18:22.942 --> 03:18:24.667
SAM: We got some stuff and among

4411
03:18:24.667 --> 03:18:26.890
the stuff, that was a sword thing.

4412
03:18:28.565 --> 03:18:31.807
MARISHA: Goddamn, I want that staff. It's good.

4413
03:18:31.807 --> 03:18:33.138
MATT: And the ring.

4414
03:18:33.138 --> 03:18:34.403
SAM: Are you taking the ring?

4415
03:18:34.403 --> 03:18:35.791
LAURA: Of course he's taking the ring.

4416
03:18:35.791 --> 03:18:37.011
LIAM: Certainly I'm taking the ring.

4417
03:18:37.011 --> 03:18:38.549
SAM: What about Yasha?
TALIESIN: Is it 1d6 halved?

4418
03:18:38.549 --> 03:18:39.382
MATT: As far as the--?

4419
03:18:39.382 --> 03:18:41.128
TALIESIN: Recharge-regain?
MATT: Yeah.

4420
03:18:42.670 --> 03:18:44.580
SAM: She's in the front of battle all the time!

4421
03:18:44.580 --> 03:18:46.420
LAURA: She also has a much lower AC than you.

4422
03:18:46.420 --> 03:18:47.778
SAM: But you know what--
LIAM: She doesn't.

4423
03:18:47.778 --> 03:18:49.412
LAURA: Yes, she does.
LIAM: That's incorrect.

4424
03:18:49.412 --> 03:18:51.020
SAM: Caleb is very, very important.

4425
03:18:51.020 --> 03:18:52.738
TALIESIN: Fuck, that's mean.

4426
03:18:52.738 --> 03:18:55.473
LIAM: You are misinformed.

4427
03:18:55.473 --> 03:18:57.191
TALIESIN: I can mount my crystal?
LIAM: What's your AC, Ash?

4428
03:18:57.191 --> 03:18:58.198
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: 14.

4429
03:18:58.198 --> 03:18:59.592
LIAM: 14. 11.

4430
03:18:59.592 --> 03:19:02.475
SAM: Ooh oh! He needs it.

4431
03:19:02.475 --> 03:19:05.227
He needs it, don't you take it away from my Caleb.

4432
03:19:05.227 --> 03:19:07.067
TRAVIS: He's a special boy!

4433
03:19:07.067 --> 03:19:09.160
LIAM: She has raging, which halves all damage.

4434
03:19:09.160 --> 03:19:12.375
Leave me alone. I am a wee bab on the battlefield.

4435
03:19:12.375 --> 03:19:13.905
TALIESIN: We're going to figure you out.

4436
03:19:13.905 --> 03:19:15.710
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4437
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:17.195
MARISHA: Can I have your flashlight thing?

4438
03:19:18.130 --> 03:19:20.070
LIAM: You have the goggles.

4439
03:19:20.070 --> 03:19:21.899
MARISHA: I want the flashlight thing.

4440
03:19:21.899 --> 03:19:23.611
(laughter)

4441
03:19:23.611 --> 03:19:25.119
LIAM: If you give me the goggles.

4442
03:19:25.119 --> 03:19:26.470
MARISHA: No, fuck you.

4443
03:19:26.470 --> 03:19:28.020
LIAM: Well, fuck you.

4444
03:19:28.020 --> 03:19:29.540
SAM: Hit him in the shoulder.

4445
03:19:30.398 --> 03:19:32.981
(laughter)

4446
03:19:40.552 --> 03:19:42.940
MARISHA: Let's go find our new fucking house.

4447
03:19:42.940 --> 03:19:45.230
TRAVIS: Lead on.

4448
03:19:45.230 --> 03:19:49.130
MATT: "This way," and he glides off to lead you.

4449
03:19:49.130 --> 03:19:51.430
LAURA: I'm looking low trying to get a look.

4450
03:19:51.430 --> 03:19:52.700
MATT: Make a perception check.

4451
03:19:52.700 --> 03:19:54.190
SAM: Is it like a centipede, like

4452
03:19:54.190 --> 03:19:55.700
there's 100 little legs?

4453
03:19:56.958 --> 03:20:00.470
LAURA: Perception, perception, perception. 18.

4454
03:20:00.470 --> 03:20:03.430
MATT: 18. Following below, it's hard to see

4455
03:20:03.430 --> 03:20:05.430
because the cloak almost meets the ground,

4456
03:20:05.430 --> 03:20:09.200
but looking below: his feet aren't touching the ground.

4457
03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:10.416
LAURA: Holy shit!

4458
03:20:11.532 --> 03:20:12.816
MATT: He's just drifting.

4459
03:20:12.816 --> 03:20:15.532
LAURA: By the light, that guy floats.

4460
03:20:15.532 --> 03:20:16.865
TRAVIS: "By the light."

4461
03:20:16.865 --> 03:20:20.056
LIAM: ♪ By the li-li-li-li-li ♪

4462
03:20:21.430 --> 03:20:23.070
MATT: So.

4463
03:20:23.070 --> 03:20:24.700
Leading you through the Gallimaufry,

4464
03:20:24.700 --> 03:20:27.470
back to the Firmaments, across the way

4465
03:20:27.470 --> 03:20:30.540
from where the Marble Tomes Conservatory is,

4466
03:20:30.540 --> 03:20:32.340
and hidden amongst the various other temples

4467
03:20:32.340 --> 03:20:35.120
and large structures of worship that reside

4468
03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:38.159
around the core vicinity of this city.

4469
03:20:38.159 --> 03:20:40.460
Eventually, you are brought to exterior

4470
03:20:40.460 --> 03:20:43.210
of a two-story mansion that is paneled

4471
03:20:43.210 --> 03:20:46.300
in Vermaloc wood painted a dark maroon color

4472
03:20:46.300 --> 03:20:49.430
with a lighter stone foundation.

4473
03:20:49.430 --> 03:20:51.300
The roofing is dark, near black

4474
03:20:51.300 --> 03:20:55.090
clay tiling with a single balcony on the second floor.

4475
03:20:55.090 --> 03:20:56.830
It appears to have a short tower

4476
03:20:56.830 --> 03:20:59.730
built into the back right corner of the home

4477
03:20:59.730 --> 03:21:01.970
that raises to a third story.

4478
03:21:01.970 --> 03:21:03.950
Two stained glass windows installed

4479
03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:05.190
towards the front are similar

4480
03:21:05.190 --> 03:21:07.203
to what you've seen in the Lucid Bastion.

4481
03:21:08.136 --> 03:21:09.750
As you approach and take a moment

4482
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:12.160
to look over it, Essek goes, "For as long

4483
03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:14.550
"as you have need, this home is yours

4484
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:17.760
"under the direction of Den Thelyss.

4485
03:21:18.760 --> 03:21:20.330
"Make of it as you will

4486
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:22.851
"and enjoy, friends of the Bright Queen.

4487
03:21:22.851 --> 03:21:25.053
"There will be more to be done soon enough,"

4488
03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:28.220
and he hands the keys over.

4489
03:21:28.220 --> 03:21:30.780
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question?

4490
03:21:30.780 --> 03:21:32.640
We ran into someone who mentioned

4491
03:21:32.640 --> 03:21:36.307
that they have gatherings over in these areas

4492
03:21:36.307 --> 03:21:39.120
of worship in the Firmament, regular

4493
03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:43.070
displays of letting the sun in a bit?

4494
03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:44.970
MATT: "Right, that is correct."

4495
03:21:44.970 --> 03:21:47.700
TRAVIS: Is such a display scheduled to happen

4496
03:21:47.700 --> 03:21:49.230
anytime soon?

4497
03:21:49.230 --> 03:21:51.922
MATT: "That is not up to me. I am not one

4498
03:21:51.922 --> 03:21:52.810
"of the priests of the Luxon.

4499
03:21:52.810 --> 03:21:54.800
"Usually when the weather is right

4500
03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:57.454
"and it's been time and when they decide,

4501
03:21:57.454 --> 03:21:59.713
"then yes."

4502
03:21:59.713 --> 03:22:03.469
TRAVIS: Do they send out like a communique

4503
03:22:03.469 --> 03:22:05.458
or a call or a horn?

4504
03:22:06.560 --> 03:22:10.503
MATT: "You'll know because the--"
TRAVIS: Sun.

4505
03:22:10.503 --> 03:22:13.900
MATT: "Sun will come out, which is rare in this town."

4506
03:22:13.900 --> 03:22:15.160
TRAVIS: Now that I'm saying it out loud,

4507
03:22:15.160 --> 03:22:16.200
I feel kind of stupid.

4508
03:22:17.310 --> 03:22:18.300
MATT: "It's all right.

4509
03:22:19.400 --> 03:22:22.570
"Anyway, enjoy your abode."

4510
03:22:22.570 --> 03:22:24.155
LAURA: Thank you.

4511
03:22:24.155 --> 03:22:25.250
MATT: "If you need anything else."

4512
03:22:25.250 --> 03:22:26.540
LAURA: Thank you.

4513
03:22:26.540 --> 03:22:28.457
MATT: "You're welcome."

4514
03:22:29.737 --> 03:22:32.424
TALIESIN: Power move. That's a power move.

4515
03:22:32.424 --> 03:22:33.656
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4516
03:22:33.656 --> 03:22:36.231
TALIESIN: That's such a power move! Wow!

4517
03:22:36.231 --> 03:22:37.843
TRAVIS: Get that hug!

4518
03:22:37.843 --> 03:22:40.769
LAURA: Oh yes! 24.

4519
03:22:42.190 --> 03:22:43.792
MATT: He goes like--

4520
03:22:46.861 --> 03:22:49.935
And then ever so slowly drifts.
TRAVIS: Hug my wife, bitch.

4521
03:22:51.187 --> 03:22:53.140
(laughter)

4522
03:22:53.140 --> 03:22:55.285
LAURA: I hug him like real good

4523
03:22:55.285 --> 03:22:57.485
and I hold it for an awkward amount of time.

4524
03:23:00.696 --> 03:23:02.622
LIAM: Give him the Molly Shannon.

4525
03:23:05.420 --> 03:23:07.956
MATT: "You're welcome."

4526
03:23:07.956 --> 03:23:09.929
LAURA: Thank you so much.

4527
03:23:09.929 --> 03:23:11.120
LIAM: Yep!

4528
03:23:14.506 --> 03:23:17.898
MATT: "Anyway. I'll take my leave." (zooms)

4529
03:23:17.898 --> 03:23:20.481
(laughter)

4530
03:23:21.520 --> 03:23:23.507
Well, there is your home.

4531
03:23:23.507 --> 03:23:24.489
MARISHA: There are blueprints!

4532
03:23:24.489 --> 03:23:25.657
TALIESIN: What!

4533
03:23:25.657 --> 03:23:27.347
LAURA: We have a house!

4534
03:23:27.347 --> 03:23:28.973
TALIESIN: Holy shit.

4535
03:23:28.973 --> 03:23:31.476
LAURA: Wow, this is so cool.
TRAVIS: That's big.

4536
03:23:31.476 --> 03:23:32.760
MATT: You guys get to decide

4537
03:23:32.760 --> 03:23:35.067
whose rooms are where and what you want

4538
03:23:35.067 --> 03:23:37.480
to outfit it with. Also,

4539
03:23:38.321 --> 03:23:40.210
essentially, depending on what you guys

4540
03:23:40.210 --> 03:23:42.730
want to do, you have a week or more of downtime.

4541
03:23:42.730 --> 03:23:44.890
Start thinking about what you want to do

4542
03:23:44.890 --> 03:23:47.110
in Rosohna with that time.

4543
03:23:47.110 --> 03:23:49.220
LIAM: Are we doing like a jump cut?

4544
03:23:49.220 --> 03:23:51.240
MATT: We're going to be--next session,

4545
03:23:51.240 --> 03:23:52.784
as we're about to finish up here,

4546
03:23:52.784 --> 03:23:54.875
because I have an early morning.

4547
03:23:54.875 --> 03:23:56.100
We're going to go ahead and start working

4548
03:23:56.100 --> 03:23:57.770
through the things you guys want to accomplish

4549
03:23:57.770 --> 03:23:59.710
and figure out what your next plan of action is.

4550
03:23:59.710 --> 03:24:00.840
This way, at least you'll have a week

4551
03:24:00.840 --> 03:24:02.300
to start planning that out, figuring out

4552
03:24:02.300 --> 03:24:03.848
what you want to do and what your next

4553
03:24:03.848 --> 03:24:06.590
direction may be.

4554
03:24:06.590 --> 03:24:08.030
LAURA: I'm taking a picture so that

4555
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:10.437
we can send this out and we can claim our bedrooms.

4556
03:24:10.437 --> 03:24:12.400
MATT: Okay.

4557
03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:15.200
MARISHA: We haven't done this since Greyskull.

4558
03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:17.680
LAURA: I know! Where's the tower?

4559
03:24:17.680 --> 03:24:19.850
TALIESIN: There's three towers, there's--yeah.

4560
03:24:19.850 --> 03:24:21.159
That's top of the tower.

4561
03:24:21.159 --> 03:24:23.269
LAURA: Oh, okay. There's the top of the tower.

4562
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:24.415
TRAVIS: You know who hasn't seen it all?

4563
03:24:24.415 --> 03:24:26.630
The people on this side of the table.

4564
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:28.090
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's weird it got sent over here, isn't it?

4565
03:24:28.090 --> 03:24:29.620
LAURA: Isn't that weird how it feels?

4566
03:24:29.620 --> 03:24:32.084
MATT: Not as colored, but here you have it.

4567
03:24:32.084 --> 03:24:34.834
ALL: Oh!

4568
03:24:36.290 --> 03:24:37.509
MATT: Anyway.

4569
03:24:37.509 --> 03:24:38.475
TRAVIS: (fake sneezes)

4570
03:24:38.475 --> 03:24:40.053
LIAM: Ew!

4571
03:24:40.053 --> 03:24:42.250
SAM: We also have to choose a name for the keep that is not

4572
03:24:42.250 --> 03:24:44.473
copyrighted like the last one.

4573
03:24:44.473 --> 03:24:48.009
(laughter)

4574
03:24:48.009 --> 03:24:50.762
TRAVIS: I was going to call it Winterfell.

4575
03:24:50.762 --> 03:24:52.348
SAM: The White House.

4576
03:24:52.348 --> 03:24:53.499
TRAVIS: Yeah, The White House.

4577
03:24:53.499 --> 03:24:55.241
MATT: As you take the keys and open the front

4578
03:24:55.241 --> 03:24:58.984
door and enter the dark but comparably

4579
03:24:58.984 --> 03:25:01.372
warm and dry interior of your new gifted

4580
03:25:01.372 --> 03:25:03.751
home courtesy of Den Thelyss.

4581
03:25:03.751 --> 03:25:07.110
SAM: I'm going to carry Yeza across the threshold.

4582
03:25:08.615 --> 03:25:10.910
MATT: Okay. As you step in,

4583
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:12.790
we're going to go ahead and end our session

4584
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:14.650
there tonight. We'll pick up there

4585
03:25:14.650 --> 03:25:16.858
next week on Thursday.

4586
03:25:16.858 --> 03:25:19.250
MARISHA: Can't believe about the sword situation.

4587
03:25:19.250 --> 03:25:21.390
SAM: Yeah, the fucking sword.

4588
03:25:21.390 --> 03:25:22.970
LIAM: We're doing an elapsed time,

4589
03:25:22.970 --> 03:25:25.050
like I want to do this this and this?

4590
03:25:25.050 --> 03:25:26.083
MATT: Yeah.

4591
03:25:26.083 --> 03:25:30.230
You know, we'll do whatever our quick elements.

4592
03:25:30.230 --> 03:25:32.280
If there is a role play or

4593
03:25:32.280 --> 03:25:34.030
a social encounter or any sort of challenge

4594
03:25:34.030 --> 03:25:35.400
involved with these, we'll go through

4595
03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:37.450
those as we have in past.

4596
03:25:37.450 --> 03:25:39.060
Yeah, you guys have a week to start figuring

4597
03:25:39.060 --> 03:25:41.590
out what you want to do for the time period

4598
03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:44.920
and what your next path is.

4599
03:25:44.920 --> 03:25:47.170
TRAVIS: Hey, hey, hey. Focus up.

4600
03:25:47.170 --> 03:25:48.014
LAURA: Sorry.

4601
03:25:48.014 --> 03:25:49.830
SAM: We're choosing our bedrooms!

4602
03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:51.993
TALIESIN: Trying to decorate here, what the hell.

4603
03:25:51.993 --> 03:25:53.897
MARISHA: Is there room for a training pit?

4604
03:25:53.897 --> 03:25:56.440
MATT: If you want to clear out one of the rooms, you can.

4605
03:25:56.440 --> 03:25:58.893
We'll talk about it in a minute.

4606
03:25:58.893 --> 03:26:02.194
SAM: You know, the Empire could have

4607
03:26:02.194 --> 03:26:05.544
had us on their side if they just gave us a house.

4608
03:26:06.720 --> 03:26:08.520
Just like a condo.

4609
03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:10.870
TALIESIN: It's a gilded cage, a gilded cage.

4610
03:26:12.272 --> 03:26:14.711
SAM: All right, go on, Matt.
MARISHA: Sorry.

4611
03:26:14.711 --> 03:26:15.930
MATT: No worries. We will be back here

4612
03:26:15.930 --> 03:26:18.510
in a week to pick up from where we left off.

4613
03:26:18.510 --> 03:26:21.827
We love you guys very much, and is it Thursday yet?

4614
03:26:21.827 --> 03:26:23.486
Good night.

4615
03:26:23.486 --> 03:26:26.236

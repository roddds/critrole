MATT: Hello everyone,

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.887
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.887 --> 00:00:04.212
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:06.026
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.937
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:11.370
LIAM: Play it.
MATT: Yep. (laughs)

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.367
Before we jump in to tonight's episode,

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.337
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:16.714
beginning with first of our two sponsors tonight,

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:17.997
Ghostfire Gaming.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.228
Sam.

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:20.587
SAM: Breaker one-nine!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.737
Breaker one-nine!

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:25.177
This is Promisin' Young Man hollering at you.

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:28.307
Going double nickel from Cow Town to Derby City.

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.754
My trailer's topped off with a wide load

00:00:30.754 --> 00:00:32.787
of super cool stuff from our friends

00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:35.427
at Ghostfire Gaming and their latest campaign,

00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:38.837
Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire.

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:41.207
Yep, I'm hauling copies of the latest supplement

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.177
that provides over 400 new dark fantasy themed monsters

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:48.007
for DMs to challenge players and enhance their games.

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:49.697
But this ain't no Suez Canal.

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:52.213
My cargo's too important to get waylaid.

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:53.857
(laughter)

00:00:53.857 --> 00:00:55.494
Not even by old Betty Sue,

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:57.882
that frisky server at the Flying Hook.

00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:01.219
So I got my eyeballs out for any county mounties

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.297
or kojacks with a Kodak who want to lollipop

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.562
this wiggle wagon.

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:06.415
(laughter)

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.737
Uh-oh, there will be sirens!

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.287
Oh no, sirens!

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:13.969
(laughter)
(hands clapping)

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.005
I promise after we're done.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.687
Shit and shine-ola, I ran right through a bear trap.

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:20.985
I got smokies on my six.
(laughter)

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:23.537
But, oh no, but each monster

00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:26.397
in this monster grimoire supplement provides mechanics

00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:29.787
for DMs to give existing creatures a surprising twist,

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:31.827
such as making them undead,

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:33.827
a fiend, or even a legendary creature.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.517
So I got to get it there on time.

00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:38.467
I'm going to flick the rocket sprocket

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:40.427
and throw down the hammer.

00:01:40.427 --> 00:01:41.633
See ya, piggies!

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:42.466
Woohoo!

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.360
I'm disregarding the law for ghost ride-- ghost--

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.668
Ghostfire Games!

00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:48.867
(laughter)

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:51.408
Oh no, another sound effect.

00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:54.449
(laughter)

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:55.672
My tire blew,

00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:57.316
as you can all hear.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:58.507
(laughter)

00:01:58.507 --> 00:01:59.987
I blew a rubber band.

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:03.297
My rig's going alligator all over the black top.

00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:06.071
I probably should pull over for safety, but the fans

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:09.277
are counting on this Monster Grimoire shipment.

00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:12.594
It details how characters can harvest monster parts

00:02:12.594 --> 00:02:14.917
to turn it into equipment or magic items.

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:15.750
Ah, fuck it!

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.927
I'm going to steer in gear at 17 wheels

00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:18.977
the rest of the way.

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:22.597
I'm a safety hazard for Ghostfire Games!

00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:25.249
Oh no, swerving, whoa!

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.712
(laughter)
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:30.407
SAM: Ah criminey almighty, I've struck someone.

00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:32.397
It doesn't appear to be human.

00:02:32.397 --> 00:02:34.672
Oh yep, it's one of them aliens.

00:02:34.672 --> 00:02:38.197
Probe ship landed in the middle of Route 66, gray skin,

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:41.087
blue blood, capable of near-light speed travel.

00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:44.467
Definitely the most advanced
extraterrestrial ever discovered,

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:47.797
and it seems they still have a pulse.

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:49.587
I should probably try to revive it.

00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:52.107
No, but Ghostfire Games is too important!

00:02:52.107 --> 00:02:53.507
Fuck it!

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.097
Nope, I'm shedding those Martian pounds

00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:57.637
like my old beer belly.

00:02:57.637 --> 00:02:59.847
Just so I can keep truckin' down to

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:04.437
bit.ly/GHMonsters to support their campaign.

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:06.267
Yep, we're not making contact

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:07.987
with intelligent life tonight

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:11.837
'cause Ghostfire Games is too important!

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:13.668
Back to you, Matt.

00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:16.687
(laughter)

00:03:16.687 --> 00:03:17.626
Over and out.

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:19.810
MATT: Thank you.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.118
ASHLEY: There's the wildest ride in the wilderness.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:22.951
(laughter)

00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:25.333
I sound like Thunder Mountain guy.
MATT: Yep, yep.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.957
MATT: I got a story for you later.
LAURA: Your face is so red.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.068
SAM: That took a lot of energy.

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:31.776
TRAVIS: I have so many questions about your writing process.

00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:32.859
TALIESIN: That's what Red Bull's for.

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.691
ASHLEY: Wait, what's Grim Holla?

00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:35.833
(laughter)

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:38.027
SAM: Didn't you understand the ad?!

00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:40.084
Grim Hollow is what I was advertising.

00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:41.527
ASHLEY: Grim Hollow.

00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:43.144
SAM: Oh, did I say "holla"?

00:03:43.144 --> 00:03:43.977
(laughing)

00:03:43.977 --> 00:03:46.788
I guess I should say the product name of the sponsors.

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:47.887
(laughter)

00:03:47.887 --> 00:03:49.260
Grim Hollow.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.130
MATT: There we go.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.867
Perfect. Thank you, Sam.

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:54.716
(mouthed) I'm so sorry.
(laughter)

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:55.776
SAM: Grim Holla!

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:57.267
MATT: Oh boy.
ASHLEY: Grim Holla!

00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:59.717
MATT: And thank you, Ghostfire Gaming.

00:03:59.717 --> 00:04:01.847
Our second sponsor for tonight,

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:03.527
Square Enix.

00:04:03.527 --> 00:04:05.407
Been fans of theirs for very long time.

00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:07.407
Pretty much most of my life gaming.

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:08.544
And this is really cool.

00:04:08.544 --> 00:04:10.107
This episode is sponsored specifically

00:04:10.107 --> 00:04:13.377
about the release of SaGa Frontier Remastered available now

00:04:13.377 --> 00:04:16.867
on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PS4, iOS, and Android.

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:19.237
I played the shit out of the SaGa Frontier

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:20.327
when it first came out for the PlayStation.

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.937
I love that game. I'm super excited
to play this remaster version.

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:26.317
It is the beloved 1998 RPG classic that is reborn

00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:28.087
with improved graphics, additional features,

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:31.574
and a new main character, which I'm super excited for.

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:33.390
Experience this role-playing game as one of eight heroes,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.666
each with their own goals, storylines, and endings.

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:36.987
It was one of the first games where you choose

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:38.757
at the beginning which person's story to follow

00:04:38.757 --> 00:04:41.237
and how they eventually merged into it.

00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:42.177
I was in high school at the time,

00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:44.055
back in those ancient days.

00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:47.782
But Akitoshi Kawazu,

00:04:47.782 --> 00:04:50.727
who is the creator of the SaGa series,

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:52.717
is actually a long time D&amp;D player.

00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:56.397
And that love has definitely can be seen coming throughout

00:04:56.397 --> 00:04:58.197
the SaGa Frontier, especially

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:01.327
in the instances of making your character's decisions

00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:03.317
and having them definitely affect the path of your journey

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:04.567
as you go, which is awesome.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:05.947
And to celebrate this release, they're free to

00:05:05.947 --> 00:05:09.587
play Romancing SaGa Re;univerSe.

00:05:09.587 --> 00:05:12.277
The "S" is capitalized; I assume that's intentional.

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:14.437
Mobile RPG experience for Android and iOS,

00:05:14.437 --> 00:05:15.607
has a ton of free rewards

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.547
and special in-game events going on right now.

00:05:18.547 --> 00:05:23.547
So go check it all out at bit.ly/CRSaGa,

00:05:24.087 --> 00:05:26.207
and thanks to Square Enix for supporting our show.

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:28.137
You guys are awesome.

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:30.394
And, of course, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:05:30.394 --> 00:05:32.127
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:34.697
MATT: Who've been with us for
the entire length of this campaign.

00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:37.477
It is a fantastic online digital toolset to keep all

00:05:37.477 --> 00:05:38.767
of your campaign information

00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:40.427
and all your character information.

00:05:40.427 --> 00:05:42.107
If you haven't had a chance to check it out, please do.

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:42.940
It's awesome.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.877
We use it here and it's extremely helpful.

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:48.560
And right now, you can have
the D&amp;D Beyond's Master tier subscription

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.065
that DMs can then share all the books that they own

00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:52.897
with the group within their campaign.

00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:54.227
And they have access to all their stuff in there,

00:05:54.227 --> 00:05:55.267
which is awesome.

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:59.377

There we go. My brain is shutting down.

00:06:14.264 --> 00:06:15.742
I've been talking too much.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.338
Ashley, you got some announcements.

00:06:17.338 --> 00:06:20.264
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, I have an announcement again.

00:06:20.264 --> 00:06:24.487
Hey, so thank you so much for your support

00:06:24.487 --> 00:06:27.797
of our Critical Role Foundation fundraising campaign

00:06:27.797 --> 00:06:29.414
with our friends at 826LA.

00:06:29.414 --> 00:06:31.157
(cheering)

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:34.147
So since we are pre-recording the show,

00:06:34.147 --> 00:06:38.977
the best way to catch real-time fundraising updates is

00:06:38.977 --> 00:06:43.977
by following us at @CriticalRoleFDN,

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:47.566
that's F as in fancy,

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:49.891
D as in dunamancy,

00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:51.782
N as in noodles.

00:06:51.782 --> 00:06:56.447
So, @CriticalRoleFDN on Facebook and Twitter.

00:06:56.447 --> 00:06:58.847
And to learn more about our campaign

00:06:58.847 --> 00:07:00.917

00:07:07.257 --> 00:07:08.090
I'm done.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.037
MATT: Fancy, dunamancy noodles, everybody.

00:07:11.037 --> 00:07:12.507
Thank you, Ashley.

00:07:12.507 --> 00:07:13.917
And Laura, you had announcements to make.

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:15.917
LAURA: Oh, I do?
MATT: Yep.

00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:19.917
LAURA: Okay, so today we are launching

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.407
just, like, a ton of stuff

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:24.057
and I'm going to show it all to you right now.

00:07:24.057 --> 00:07:26.480
Well, most of it, yeah.
SAM: Okay, let's do it.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.862
LAURA: So it's going to be--

00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:29.958
there's different variations, and they're all available

00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.367
in all of our stores: US, UK, Australia, and Canada.

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:35.758
Okay, first up

00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:39.091
is the Boulder, Parchment, Shears T-shirt!

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.449
SAM: No!
MARISHA: Yes!

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:41.765
LIAM: There it is!
SAM: Yes!

00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:43.740
MATT: Okay, that's rad.
ASHLEY: Yes!

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.627
LAURA: It's amazing.

00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:47.427
Play with your friends.

00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:49.552
See if you can get the same thing.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.410
SAM: Oh man.
MARISHA: So good.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.277
LAURA: Next up.

00:07:53.277 --> 00:07:54.991
Oh, next up I'm presenting this one!

00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:55.877
SAM: (whispering) I want it.

00:07:55.877 --> 00:07:57.785
LAURA: Hold on. I'm really excited about this, too.

00:07:57.785 --> 00:08:00.072
TRAVIS: The rules on the front
of the shirt are pretty hilarious.

00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:01.164
LAURA: You guys haven't seen this one either.

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:02.317
SAM: No!

00:08:02.317 --> 00:08:03.875
LAURA: This is our--
SAM: (whispering) Chaos Crew!

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:05.764
LAURA: (screaming) Chaos Crew T-shirt!

00:08:05.764 --> 00:08:07.406
MATT: Nice.
LAURA: Nice and simple,

00:08:07.406 --> 00:08:09.117
easy breezy on the front.

00:08:09.117 --> 00:08:10.357
And then you got our

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:13.251
punk rock wanted poster on the back.

00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:15.079
TRAVIS: Rad-looking tag on the front.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:17.180
LAURA: Yeah, it's super awesome.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.509
MARISHA: (whispering) That's so cool.

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:22.247
LAURA: I should say the Boulder, Parchment, Shears T-shirt

00:08:22.247 --> 00:08:24.017
was designed by Grace Berríos.

00:08:24.017 --> 00:08:25.517
The Chaos Crew T-shirt was designed

00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:27.840
by Jordyn Torrence, our very own.

00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:31.159
And then the next up

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:33.259
is our Caduceus T-shirt.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:34.639
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.430
MARISHA: I want to see!

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.096
LAURA: Dun dun dun!

00:08:38.096 --> 00:08:39.762
MARISHA: So pretty!
MATT: Gorgeous!

00:08:39.762 --> 00:08:42.912
LAURA: So this is line art by Hunter Bonyun,

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:46.017
colors by Stephan McGowan.

00:08:46.017 --> 00:08:46.850
Did I say that right?

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.958
TRAVIS: It's so good!

00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.049
SAM: Sure.

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:52.001
LAURA: And additional design by Jordyn Torrence.

00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:52.834
MATT: I love it.

00:08:52.834 --> 00:08:53.667
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.397
LAURA: It's so cool.

00:08:55.397 --> 00:08:57.827
It looks like a vintage tee company.

00:08:57.827 --> 00:08:59.137
I'm in love with it.

00:08:59.137 --> 00:09:00.728
TRAVIS: What a great color.
MATT: Yeah.

00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:01.969
MARISHA: It's so cute.
LAURA: And then--

00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:03.167
This is also really cool,

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:05.227
and you guys haven't seen this either!

00:09:05.227 --> 00:09:06.837
LIAM: What's that, what's that?

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:09.274
SAM: It's a box.
LAURA: This is our

00:09:09.274 --> 00:09:10.374
three pack--
ASHLEY: What?!

00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:11.698
LAURA: -- of socks!
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:09:11.698 --> 00:09:12.606
SAM: Socks?!
ASHLEY: Socks?!

00:09:12.606 --> 00:09:13.439
SAM: Socks Machina?

00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:14.480
LAURA: Yeah, Socks Machina!

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.797
ASHLEY: Socks Machina?!

00:09:15.797 --> 00:09:16.706
SAM: We did it!

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:20.247
LAURA: We got Mighty Nein socks.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:09:20.247 --> 00:09:21.710
TRAVIS: (laughs) Look at Ashley.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.485
ASHLEY: Guys, you know I love socks so much.

00:09:24.485 --> 00:09:27.957
I have been waiting for Socks Machina forever.
LAURA: We've got Critical Role socks.

00:09:27.957 --> 00:09:29.359
SAM: Those look thick and soft.

00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:31.167
LAURA: And they're thick. These are high--

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:32.949
These are good socks.

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:35.600
And these are our Vox Machina socks!

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.908
ASHLEY: I mean--!

00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:38.154
LAURA: Yeah, so they come in a three pack.

00:09:38.154 --> 00:09:39.534
SAM: Those are cute colors.

00:09:39.534 --> 00:09:40.967
LAURA: I know, they're really great.

00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:42.717
SAM: I will wear that.

00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:43.857
LAURA: So yeah, check 'em out.

00:09:43.857 --> 00:09:45.327
They're in our stores.

00:09:45.327 --> 00:09:47.107
And lastly, the Mighty Nein lightweight hoodie,

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:48.417
which I held up before

00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:49.657
so I don't have it tonight,

00:09:49.657 --> 00:09:52.177
featuring the classic designed by Bryan Weiss,

00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:54.427
is available in our UK store.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.260
So that's everything.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.205
TRAVIS: Yay!

00:09:56.205 --> 00:09:57.857
SAM: Wow, what a drop.

00:09:57.857 --> 00:09:59.248
LAURA: I know, right?
ASHLEY: What a drop.

00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:00.489
I want all of it.

00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:02.217
LAURA: The socks, though, y'all.

00:10:02.217 --> 00:10:03.167
MATT: It's pretty rad.

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:04.257
MARISHA: Are they, like, soft?

00:10:04.257 --> 00:10:06.657
LAURA: Yeah, no, they're really comfy.

00:10:06.657 --> 00:10:10.217
I am lucky to get to wear the samples at home.

00:10:10.217 --> 00:10:11.622
MATT: Dammit.
ASHLEY: Damn.

00:10:11.622 --> 00:10:12.813
MATT: Well, thank you, Laura. That's amazing.

00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:14.130
ASHLEY: I'm still waiting on my Vax cloak.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.487
LAURA: (laughs) I know.

00:10:15.487 --> 00:10:16.870
ASHLEY: Don't know if that's going to happen.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.176
(laughter)

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:20.772
TALIESIN: Pajamas, pajamas are--
LAURA: I think I've got one for you, Ashley.

00:10:20.772 --> 00:10:22.140
ASHLEY: I missed the pajamas.
SAM: What size?

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.417
LAURA: I know!
MARISHA: I've got those.

00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:24.250
SAM: Well, we'll talk later.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.217
LAURA: Yeah.

00:10:25.217 --> 00:10:27.057
MARISHA: I had the Nicodranas sweat pants

00:10:27.057 --> 00:10:29.496
and Omar ate a hole in the pockets.

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:30.377
LAURA: (gasps) No.

00:10:30.377 --> 00:10:32.497
LIAM: In the pocket?
MARISHA: I was like, "You don't--"

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:34.582
Because I kept treats in there and he was like,

00:10:34.582 --> 00:10:36.674
"There must be treats," and he was like--
TRAVIS: You were just askin' for that.

00:10:36.674 --> 00:10:37.832
SAM: That's user error.

00:10:37.832 --> 00:10:40.167
MARISHA: Well, he just still-- Yeah, yeah.

00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:42.017
LAURA: I never got the sweat pants.

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.008
I didn't get the joggers.
MARISHA: I was like,

00:10:43.008 --> 00:10:45.920
"You don't understand what you've eaten!"

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.040
LAURA: We got to get us some some stuff, yo.
SAM: I know.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.227
TALIESIN: You do get to say well played.
SAM: I don't have the pjs,

00:10:49.227 --> 00:10:51.293
I don't got nothing.

00:10:51.293 --> 00:10:52.577
MARISHA: I was so mad.

00:10:52.577 --> 00:10:55.467
TALIESIN: Well played. You win this round.

00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:57.887
MARISHA: These are so sold out.
You don't fucking get it.

00:10:57.887 --> 00:10:58.720
You piece of shit.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.607
ASHLEY: These are so sold out.

00:11:00.607 --> 00:11:02.158
MATT: I'd wear Sloss' pajamas.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:11:02.158 --> 00:11:05.107
MATT: Anyway, thank you so much.

00:11:05.107 --> 00:11:07.317
I think it's time for us to go ahead and

00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:10.618
jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:11:10.618 --> 00:11:13.280
(exclaiming)

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.463
(water bubbling)

00:11:15.463 --> 00:11:18.754
(thunder rumbling)

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:22.571

MATT: Welcome back.

00:12:50.087 --> 00:12:53.004
So last we left off:

00:12:53.004 --> 00:12:55.245
The Mighty Nein, after setting a trap

00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:57.797
for the Tomb Takers shortly into their descent

00:12:57.797 --> 00:13:00.062
into the ruins of Aeor.

00:13:00.062 --> 00:13:03.147
You waited and were rewarded, it seems,

00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:05.327
as they stumbled into your trap,

00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:08.227
immediately wiping out three of the five of them.

00:13:08.227 --> 00:13:10.747
As you attempted to close the distance

00:13:10.747 --> 00:13:14.183
on the two surviving members, Lucien and Cree,

00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:16.627
they managed to escape, beyond the tunnel where

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:18.717
you were going to travel and collapse it behind them.

00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:19.957
SAM: ♪ Escapin' their way! ♪

00:13:19.957 --> 00:13:20.790
MATT: Yep.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.647
TRAVIS: Ooh boy.
(laughter)

00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:25.777
MATT: You slowly crawled your way through, pulling some

00:13:25.777 --> 00:13:29.157
of the loose rubble aside enough to leave yourself a way in.

00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:31.877
You began to experience and wander

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:35.167
through the Praesidis Ward of Aeor.

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:38.417
Within, you discovered information about some

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:39.757
of the layout of the city.

00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:43.117
You decided not to investigate the interior

00:13:43.117 --> 00:13:44.877
of a necropolis.

00:13:44.877 --> 00:13:47.387
You went into an auditorium

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:52.067
and brought to consciousness an Aeormaton,

00:13:52.067 --> 00:13:55.617
some sort of synthetic being that was created

00:13:55.617 --> 00:13:59.367
during the era of Aeor, named him Charlie,

00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:04.040
and are carrying him via a 3PO backpack on Jester.

00:14:05.717 --> 00:14:09.410
You then began to follow the trail of bodies left behind

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.077
as the Tomb Takers, the two remaining members,

00:14:11.077 --> 00:14:14.668
are now fighting what's ahead of them before you,

00:14:14.668 --> 00:14:16.897
and found yourselves suddenly

00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:21.387
beset upon by strange creatures you've never seen before.

00:14:21.387 --> 00:14:24.987
You did battle with some of these Aeorian abominations.

00:14:24.987 --> 00:14:28.544
And after this extremely exhausting struggle,

00:14:28.544 --> 00:14:32.417
decided to bed down to rest your weary selves for the night.

00:14:32.417 --> 00:14:35.547
After a brief check-in, you were able to scry

00:14:35.547 --> 00:14:37.627
upon Cree and gather some information

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.927
that they themselves are also struggling a bit

00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:42.877
in their journey, but are still ahead of you in their trek.

00:14:44.077 --> 00:14:47.227
You all went to sleep comfortably within the dome.

00:14:47.227 --> 00:14:52.107
But Beauregard and Caleb seemed to be visited

00:14:52.107 --> 00:14:55.457
in their sleep by Lucien himself, as well as

00:14:55.457 --> 00:14:59.600
the sound of thousands and thousands of screams and laughs.

00:15:01.787 --> 00:15:02.620
So.

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:09.011
You all continue to rest, taking
your watches throughout the night,

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:13.397
but even the rest of you sleep not so soundly.

00:15:13.397 --> 00:15:15.187
Nightmarish imagery creeps

00:15:15.187 --> 00:15:17.887
at the outsides of whatever dreams may find you.

00:15:17.887 --> 00:15:19.437
Even pleasant memories brought

00:15:19.437 --> 00:15:22.897
to your subconscious begin to blur into shadow,

00:15:22.897 --> 00:15:24.670
begin to bend and twist.

00:15:26.697 --> 00:15:31.427
You feel uncomfortable, unwelcome in your own subconscious.

00:15:31.427 --> 00:15:33.747
And as much tossing and turning

00:15:33.747 --> 00:15:35.847
as may have occurred throughout the night,

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.246
you do manage to complete a long rest.

00:15:38.246 --> 00:15:40.747
(relieved sighing)

00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:43.876
SAM: I got back my one hit point.

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:46.037
MATT: (laughs)

00:15:46.037 --> 00:15:50.127
SAM: Hey, for the Heroes' Feast,

00:15:50.127 --> 00:15:52.887
I think we had two extra temporary hit points.

00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:54.177
MATT: You did.

00:15:54.177 --> 00:15:56.800
SAM: Do I heal back up to those or no?

00:15:57.645 --> 00:15:58.478
LAURA: No.

00:15:59.977 --> 00:16:00.937
MATT: It is your maximum hit points.

00:16:00.937 --> 00:16:03.697
You would heal up to your full, maximum hit points.

00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:04.530
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.107
Because we still-- when did we have the feast?

00:16:07.107 --> 00:16:07.940
How long ago was it?

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.237
It's a 24-hour spell?

00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:10.317
MATT: You had it before you slept.

00:16:10.317 --> 00:16:11.647
It was a 24-hour spell, I believe.

00:16:11.647 --> 00:16:12.907
LAURA: Yeah.

00:16:12.907 --> 00:16:15.767
MATT: It's pretty close to being done at this point.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:18.672
LIAM: We had it in the foyer of the tower before we--

00:16:18.672 --> 00:16:20.864
LAURA: Yes, and then we fought and then we chased him

00:16:20.864 --> 00:16:23.957
for like three hours and then we went to sleep.

00:16:23.957 --> 00:16:25.097
So...
TRAVIS: Eight, 16, so.

00:16:25.097 --> 00:16:28.625
LAURA: So we would have almost a full day left of it.

00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:30.357
SAM: Well, you guys slept for five hours?

00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:32.737
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

00:16:32.737 --> 00:16:33.797
MATT: So it's still going.

00:16:33.797 --> 00:16:37.197
But you have a handful of hours left on it.

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:40.427
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:16:40.427 --> 00:16:42.267
So we probably need to do it again?

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:44.417
I have one more chalice left.

00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:45.667
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:16:46.628 --> 00:16:50.327
MATT: But nevertheless, one by one,
you all begin to come to consciousness,

00:16:50.327 --> 00:16:54.377
just as the dome's magic begins to sparkle and fade.

00:16:56.477 --> 00:16:59.060
Caleb and Beau, the least rested of the troupe.

00:17:00.447 --> 00:17:02.545
LIAM: Catch your eye across the dome.

00:17:07.488 --> 00:17:09.847
MARISHA: Guess we should go through the checklist?

00:17:09.847 --> 00:17:10.850
LIAM: Inspection time.

00:17:13.487 --> 00:17:14.427
SAM: Oh boy.

00:17:14.427 --> 00:17:16.167
MATT: Immediately you can see right

00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:20.684
above the clavicle on Beauregard, a third red eye.

00:17:20.684 --> 00:17:22.054
TRAVIS: Whoa, wait where? Where, where where?

00:17:22.054 --> 00:17:24.027
The clavicle or the sternum?

00:17:24.027 --> 00:17:24.957
MATT: Well, sternum.

00:17:24.957 --> 00:17:25.790
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.623
MATT: Right up there.

00:17:26.623 --> 00:17:28.351
MARISHA: Like right here in the middle?

00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:29.477
TRAVIS: All about placement, you guys.

00:17:29.477 --> 00:17:30.966
MARISHA: Does it look cool?

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:32.647
LIAM: That is disconcerting.

00:17:32.647 --> 00:17:33.480
ASHLEY: Fuck.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.908
LAURA: Is it... Oh.

00:17:35.908 --> 00:17:37.524
TALIESIN: Mm.

00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:39.515
LAURA: It's so close to your heart, Beau!

00:17:39.515 --> 00:17:41.725
MARISHA: (gags)

00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:42.558
LAURA: Where's yours?

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:43.924
SAM: Are they all the same color?

00:17:43.924 --> 00:17:45.280
MATT: They are all red.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.337
SAM: And what about you?
ASHLEY: It's three now?

00:17:47.337 --> 00:17:48.277
LIAM: Strip, strip, strip.

00:17:48.277 --> 00:17:49.577
LAURA: Taint.

00:17:49.577 --> 00:17:52.587
MATT: You look around his torso as the coat's down.

00:17:52.587 --> 00:17:54.577
TRAVIS: Penie tip.
(laughter)

00:17:54.577 --> 00:17:57.077
MATT: You don't see any additional eyes on your torso.

00:17:58.287 --> 00:17:59.120
TRAVIS: You don't?

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.877
SAM: The legs, check the legs.

00:18:00.877 --> 00:18:02.445
LIAM: I pants myself, yeah.

00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:03.477
MATT: Nothing on the legs.

00:18:03.477 --> 00:18:04.527
SAM: Arms?

00:18:04.527 --> 00:18:05.427
LIAM: Whoa.

00:18:05.427 --> 00:18:08.250
MATT: Okay, you look at the left hand in the palm.

00:18:09.163 --> 00:18:10.497
LIAM: You'd think I'd see that first.

00:18:10.497 --> 00:18:14.563
(laughter)
TRAVIS: That was so unnecessary.

00:18:14.563 --> 00:18:16.977
MATT: It's always the place you look last.
LAURA: We were so worried about the ween.

00:18:16.977 --> 00:18:19.123
LIAM: Okay, I know it's somewhere.

00:18:19.123 --> 00:18:20.242
(laughter)

00:18:20.242 --> 00:18:21.685
Don't tell me where.

00:18:24.683 --> 00:18:27.057
It's on the tip of my... tongue.

00:18:27.057 --> 00:18:30.777
SAM: Wait, did you have another one on your hand before?

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.008
LIAM: It's here.
SAM: Oh yes.

00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:35.838
LIAM: It is back between my shoulder blades?

00:18:35.838 --> 00:18:37.577
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: And left hand or right hand?

00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:38.410
SAM: You had a hand.
MATT: Left hand.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.227
MARISHA: Here.

00:18:40.227 --> 00:18:42.627
Left hand. Wait, his is also on the left hand?

00:18:42.627 --> 00:18:43.460
MATT: Yeah, palm.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.905
MARISHA: So his is the front
and mine's the back of my left hand.

00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:45.917
LAURA: That's weird that they're not showing up

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.463
in the same places, you know?

00:18:47.463 --> 00:18:49.623
Like, they show up anywhere on the body?

00:18:49.623 --> 00:18:51.337
SAM: Wait, where's your third one?

00:18:51.337 --> 00:18:52.670
MARISHA: It was here.

00:18:53.577 --> 00:18:55.207
LAURA: Oh, and then it was right on the tattoo, wasn't it?

00:18:55.207 --> 00:18:57.215
MARISHA: That's right in the middle of

00:18:57.215 --> 00:18:58.537
back of my neck.
LAURA: So you have right on the front

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.216
and the back. It's like, (gags).

00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:01.597
Like straight through your neck?

00:19:01.597 --> 00:19:03.288
SAM: Oh man.

00:19:03.288 --> 00:19:04.969
LIAM: I'm here, here, here.

00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:06.349
LAURA: Do you think he can?

00:19:06.349 --> 00:19:09.510
I mean, do you think he can see through your eyes?

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.467
MARISHA: (sighs) I wouldn't put it past him. I don't know.

00:19:13.467 --> 00:19:15.957
LAURA: I wonder if our necklaces

00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:18.010
negate the effect of those.

00:19:19.934 --> 00:19:22.287
I hope so, I say directly to the eyeball.

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:27.127
LIAM: Well, we managed to fuck them up pretty hard

00:19:27.127 --> 00:19:29.835
at the entrance to these caverns.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.954
And we had two eyes at that point.

00:19:32.954 --> 00:19:36.557
So.
TRAVIS: You had crazy dreams again, yes?

00:19:36.557 --> 00:19:38.447
MARISHA: Yeah, but this time it was him.

00:19:38.447 --> 00:19:39.657
It was Lucien.

00:19:39.657 --> 00:19:41.488
TRAVIS: And you could hear him?

00:19:41.488 --> 00:19:42.617
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:19:42.617 --> 00:19:44.290
TRAVIS: Could you talk back?

00:19:45.277 --> 00:19:47.087
MARISHA: I didn't try.

00:19:47.087 --> 00:19:47.920
Did you?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.897
LIAM: Didn't really make sense.

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:50.917
Like dreams.

00:19:50.917 --> 00:19:52.067
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:53.937
TRAVIS: How did they end, the dreams?

00:19:53.937 --> 00:19:55.227
LIAM: Screaming.

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.180
MARISHA: More voices.

00:19:57.277 --> 00:19:58.717
ASHLEY: It was him?

00:19:58.717 --> 00:20:01.450
MARISHA: Him, that-- Yeah, for me it was him being like,

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.908
"Oh, welcome. Join the party,"

00:20:03.908 --> 00:20:06.850
and then it exploded into like a cacophony.

00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:10.957
TRAVIS: Hm, mm-hmm, strange dreams.

00:20:10.957 --> 00:20:13.477
LIAM: I rest the eye on my hand

00:20:13.477 --> 00:20:18.220
on top of Beau's hand on the eye, on the back of it.

00:20:21.707 --> 00:20:23.886
LAURA: Are you trying to activate them? What are you doing?

00:20:23.886 --> 00:20:25.717
TRAVIS: (whooshes)

00:20:25.717 --> 00:20:26.840
LIAM: Just commiserating.

00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:29.205
And I give it a little pat.

00:20:30.567 --> 00:20:32.447
Take it away.
MARISHA: They do line up pretty well.

00:20:32.447 --> 00:20:33.280
It's weird.

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:39.047
SAM: Well, we should probably spend a few

00:20:39.047 --> 00:20:43.887
spell slots trying to get them off because, you know.

00:20:43.887 --> 00:20:45.947
TRAVIS: The important question, how's my hair?

00:20:45.947 --> 00:20:46.780
SAM: Oh god.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.797
MARISHA: Oh yeah, great questions.

00:20:47.797 --> 00:20:48.737
MATT: Still bald.

00:20:48.737 --> 00:20:49.707
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:52.993
I wave my hand and all of my hair comes back perfect.

00:20:52.993 --> 00:20:54.097
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Perfect.

00:20:54.097 --> 00:20:56.187
SAM: Oh, is it an illusion?

00:20:56.187 --> 00:20:57.647
TALIESIN: Huh.
TRAVIS: What, no.

00:20:57.647 --> 00:20:59.293
I am a powerful practitioner of the--

00:20:59.293 --> 00:21:00.375
Don't touch it!

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:03.797
(laughter)
SAM: Mage Hand!

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:05.034
Mage Hand!
TRAVIS: It's there.

00:21:05.034 --> 00:21:05.976
It doesn't move.

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:07.359
It's not a problem.

00:21:08.764 --> 00:21:10.197
It moves in the wind.

00:21:10.197 --> 00:21:11.817
LIAM: Do the eyebrows look firmly in place

00:21:11.817 --> 00:21:12.987
or are they just like wiggling?

00:21:12.987 --> 00:21:14.603
TRAVIS: They're where they're supposed be.

00:21:14.603 --> 00:21:16.110
ASHLEY: Lift your eyebrows up.

00:21:17.487 --> 00:21:18.667
What happens?
(laughter)

00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:19.924
MATT: Yeah, he's pretty good.

00:21:19.924 --> 00:21:21.207
ASHLEY: Ah, okay. It came back.

00:21:21.207 --> 00:21:22.708
TRAVIS: See.
LAURA: Wow.

00:21:22.708 --> 00:21:24.935
LIAM: It's just like a half-second delay is all.

00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:26.357
(laughter)

00:21:26.357 --> 00:21:28.120
TRAVIS: Aeor got nothing on this.

00:21:29.117 --> 00:21:32.287
LAURA: Roll a d20 for casting that spell.

00:21:32.287 --> 00:21:33.567
Just kidding.

00:21:33.567 --> 00:21:37.240
SAM: Matt, can I cast Silent Image to make him look bald?

00:21:38.335 --> 00:21:40.887
(laughter)

00:21:40.887 --> 00:21:42.357
MATT: If you'd like to.

00:21:42.357 --> 00:21:43.467
SAM: Well, how would that work,

00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:45.937
if his illusion and my illusion are--

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:47.487
MATT: I will have you guys roll off.

00:21:47.487 --> 00:21:49.764
TRAVIS: I will counterspell you and burn all these slots.

00:21:49.764 --> 00:21:52.577
(laughter)

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:54.747
LIAM: It's probably just going to
look like a PlayStation character

00:21:54.747 --> 00:21:55.836
glitching into a wall.

00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:57.486
TRAVIS: Yeah. (glitching)

00:21:57.486 --> 00:21:58.677
SAM: Mine'll only last 10 minutes.

00:21:58.677 --> 00:22:00.857
TRAVIS: My characters can never keep their facial hair.

00:22:00.857 --> 00:22:02.684
MATT: Something all you see is just his eyes and his gums

00:22:02.684 --> 00:22:04.236
and everything else is gone.

00:22:04.236 --> 00:22:06.847
(laughter)

00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:07.997
SAM: All right, I cast it.

00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:10.583
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Let's just see.

00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:13.027
MATT: Go ahead and roll d20, add your intelligence modifier.

00:22:13.027 --> 00:22:15.077
Roll a d20 and at your charisma modifier.

00:22:15.077 --> 00:22:15.910
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.387
LAURA: Should we have a Heroes' Feast

00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:19.630
while we're doing all of this?

00:22:20.537 --> 00:22:21.537
TRAVIS: 19?

00:22:21.537 --> 00:22:22.699
TALIESIN: Maybe a little further in, I don't know.

00:22:22.699 --> 00:22:24.248
SAM: Six.

00:22:24.248 --> 00:22:25.970
MARISHA: On the next short rest, maybe.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.107
LAURA: Okay, okay.

00:22:28.107 --> 00:22:30.887
MATT: A nice attempt, but the illusion is too strong.

00:22:30.887 --> 00:22:32.540
SAM: Your magic is powerful.

00:22:33.527 --> 00:22:35.792
Old magic.

00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:37.743
TRAVIS: Worked hard for the-- old magic. (laughs)

00:22:37.743 --> 00:22:38.917
I worked hard for this.

00:22:38.917 --> 00:22:40.537
SAM: All right, fine.

00:22:40.537 --> 00:22:42.627
MATT: As the dome eventually vanishes,

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:43.987
Caleb, could you roll a d20 for me?

00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:45.513
SAM: I'll move my spell over to Beau.

00:22:45.513 --> 00:22:47.007
(laughter)

00:22:47.007 --> 00:22:48.715
LIAM: Ooh, I got a 17.

00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:49.637
LAURA: (gasps) Uh-oh.

00:22:49.637 --> 00:22:50.937
MATT: Roll percentile dice for me, please.

00:22:50.937 --> 00:22:51.770
LIAM: Yes, sir.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.004
LAURA: Oh no, it could be really bad.
SAM: On a 17?

00:22:54.004 --> 00:22:55.294
LAURA: It could be really bad, he said.

00:22:55.294 --> 00:22:56.697
LIAM: I know, here goes my hair.

00:22:56.697 --> 00:22:58.887
SAM: What spell where you casting?

00:22:58.887 --> 00:23:00.173
MATT: This is for the dome.
LIAM: The dome.

00:23:00.173 --> 00:23:02.577
SAM: Just for the dome?

00:23:02.577 --> 00:23:03.410
LIAM: 81.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.898
LAURA: (gasps)
MATT: 81.

00:23:04.898 --> 00:23:06.267
LAURA: That's so high.

00:23:06.267 --> 00:23:08.087
TALIESIN: It's so random.

00:23:08.087 --> 00:23:10.367
MATT: What do you, what is--

00:23:10.367 --> 00:23:11.577
SAM: What's your worst fear?

00:23:11.577 --> 00:23:13.247
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

00:23:13.247 --> 00:23:14.670
LAURA: Don't think about it.

00:23:15.737 --> 00:23:18.787
MATT: To Caleb's memory, throughout life,

00:23:18.787 --> 00:23:21.583
what is the smell that makes him the happiest?

00:23:21.583 --> 00:23:22.416
SAM: Aw.

00:23:24.087 --> 00:23:25.330
LIAM: Oh, uh.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.793
SAM: (whispering) KY Jelly.

00:23:26.793 --> 00:23:29.197
(quiet laughter)

00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:32.453
LIAM: What an improper time for such a statement.

00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:38.647
That is, in fact, what my mother
used to cook dessert with, so.

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:47.333
Apple tarts at home when I was still young.

00:23:48.647 --> 00:23:50.787
MATT: You pause as you're gathering your things

00:23:50.787 --> 00:23:55.170
because suddenly that aroma, so strong,

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.387
surrounds the space around you,

00:23:57.387 --> 00:23:58.895
and you can't help but glance around

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:00.027
as to what the source may be.

00:24:00.027 --> 00:24:01.285
But there is none.

00:24:02.807 --> 00:24:06.887
LIAM: Does your hand smells good to you, Beauregard?

00:24:06.887 --> 00:24:07.720
MATT: Now all of you can now begin--

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.937
MARISHA: Does my hand smell good?

00:24:09.937 --> 00:24:11.057
MATT: -- begin to smell the smell

00:24:11.057 --> 00:24:14.487
of freshly baked Zemnian apple tart.

00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:15.915
TRAVIS: What is that?

00:24:15.915 --> 00:24:17.737
LAURA: Smells really good.
SAM: Jester, is that you?

00:24:17.737 --> 00:24:18.887
ASHLEY: Delicious.
SAM: One of your--

00:24:18.887 --> 00:24:21.413
LAURA: No, but I'm getting really hungry.
SAM: -- danishes?

00:24:23.157 --> 00:24:25.917
LIAM: That is the smell of my mother baking.

00:24:25.917 --> 00:24:27.137
TALIESIN: So much butter.

00:24:27.137 --> 00:24:28.687
TRAVIS: Is this a mental attack?

00:24:28.687 --> 00:24:30.250
Are we being accosted?

00:24:33.247 --> 00:24:34.627
MARISHA: I look around.

00:24:34.627 --> 00:24:36.014
Do I see anything?
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:24:39.527 --> 00:24:41.847
MARISHA: Eight.
LIAM: Are there any desserts anywhere?

00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:43.225
MATT: It's pretty dark in here.

00:24:43.225 --> 00:24:44.233
SAM: I have some old--

00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:45.341
LAURA: I mean, there's some in my bag,

00:24:45.341 --> 00:24:46.892
but you don't want to see them.

00:24:46.892 --> 00:24:48.517
LIAM: I light up the globules

00:24:48.517 --> 00:24:49.647
and they just start floating around

00:24:49.647 --> 00:24:50.847
and I'm just looking to see

00:24:50.847 --> 00:24:53.164
if there's any-- You sure you don't have anything?

00:24:53.164 --> 00:24:54.364
LAURA: I mean, I can look.

00:24:54.364 --> 00:24:57.917
I look in my haversack.

00:24:57.917 --> 00:24:59.732
MATT: You have the treats that you brought with you.

00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:00.957
Stale as they may be, at this point.

00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:04.167
LAURA: There's one that's got a lot of mold on it.

00:25:04.167 --> 00:25:05.350
LIAM: That's not it.
LAURA: This one is

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.767
not moldy, but it's really hard.

00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:08.600
LIAM: No, thank you.

00:25:09.497 --> 00:25:11.407
LAURA: This one has crumbled into just

00:25:11.407 --> 00:25:13.610
like a few little pieces, also moldy.

00:25:14.707 --> 00:25:17.137
And this one is perfect. (laughs)

00:25:17.137 --> 00:25:18.839
It's absolutely perfect.

00:25:18.839 --> 00:25:20.137
But it's cherry though, not apple.

00:25:20.137 --> 00:25:21.577
So that's what's weird.

00:25:22.776 --> 00:25:24.109
LIAM: It's not that.

00:25:24.947 --> 00:25:26.297
MARISHA: It's got to be this place.

00:25:30.057 --> 00:25:31.807
LIAM: Well, maybe it's a passing thing.

00:25:32.687 --> 00:25:34.227
LAURA: Maybe.

00:25:34.227 --> 00:25:36.780
LIAM: Still need to go. (sniffs)

00:25:38.337 --> 00:25:39.469
Right, we still need to go?

00:25:39.469 --> 00:25:40.302
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:40.302 --> 00:25:42.657
TRAVIS: I mean, are we sure there are no apple tarts

00:25:42.657 --> 00:25:43.490
around to eat?

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.185
MARISHA: I know I am really snacky.
TRAVIS: No, you're right, we should go.

00:25:48.185 --> 00:25:49.307
LAURA: We've got to wait a few hours

00:25:49.307 --> 00:25:52.027
and then I'll give us another feast.

00:25:52.027 --> 00:25:53.707
MARISHA: We could have apple tarts.

00:25:53.707 --> 00:25:55.377
LAURA: Oh, we definitely will.
MARISHA: With the Heroes' Feast.

00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:56.437
LAURA: I know what they smell like now.

00:25:56.437 --> 00:25:58.417
So I'm pretty good at recreating.

00:25:58.417 --> 00:26:01.167
I'm like a savant when it comes to that.

00:26:01.167 --> 00:26:02.166
LIAM: Wow.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:03.224
TRAVIS: I know it's been eight hours,

00:26:03.224 --> 00:26:05.867
but down the hallway, there was a brass door

00:26:05.867 --> 00:26:07.267
that was slightly ajar?

00:26:07.267 --> 00:26:08.397
MATT: Correct.

00:26:08.397 --> 00:26:10.117
TRAVIS: Has it moved?
MATT: Off one hinge.

00:26:10.117 --> 00:26:11.557
Make a perception check.

00:26:11.557 --> 00:26:12.757
SAM: That the door that we came though?

00:26:12.757 --> 00:26:13.800
LIAM: No, it's where they left.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.054
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:26:16.746 --> 00:26:17.594
TRAVIS: 19.

00:26:17.594 --> 00:26:19.197
MATT: 19.

00:26:19.197 --> 00:26:22.217
It does not appear to have moved from its current position.

00:26:22.217 --> 00:26:23.337
You can only just see the very,

00:26:23.337 --> 00:26:26.397
very faintest bit of the green speck of light

00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:30.087
between the seams as it's slightly off to one side.

00:26:30.087 --> 00:26:32.467
And the light that you were creating, both of you

00:26:32.467 --> 00:26:35.387
your sword and your spell, reflecting a bit

00:26:35.387 --> 00:26:38.387
off of its metallic distance surface.

00:26:38.387 --> 00:26:39.777
TRAVIS: Want to give it a look?

00:26:39.777 --> 00:26:40.837
SAM: Sure.

00:26:40.837 --> 00:26:41.867
MARISHA: It's time to get moving.

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:42.700
TALIESIN: All right.

00:26:43.917 --> 00:26:46.077
SAM: All right, I'll creep out of the dome

00:26:46.077 --> 00:26:48.247
and go down to the door.

00:26:48.247 --> 00:26:49.137
TRAVIS: I'll go with you.

00:26:49.137 --> 00:26:50.900
SAM: Oh, good. I need some light.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.417
MATT: (as Essek) "If you have to be scouting ahead

00:26:52.417 --> 00:26:55.583
"for a portion of this, let me..."

00:26:55.583 --> 00:26:58.212
He reaches into his pouch and Essek pulls out the small,

00:26:58.212 --> 00:27:01.667
dark, spherical pearl and holds out in front,

00:27:01.667 --> 00:27:03.447
towards your forehead.

00:27:03.447 --> 00:27:05.847
And you feel this familiar (whooshes)

00:27:05.847 --> 00:27:10.047
a shunting of energy into your face that warms through you

00:27:10.047 --> 00:27:13.927
and you have a Mote of Possibility via Fortune's Favor.

00:27:13.927 --> 00:27:14.760
SAM: Oh.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.507
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
SAM: Thank you, Essek.

00:27:17.507 --> 00:27:19.877
TRAVIS: Lacking in originality, but okay.

00:27:19.877 --> 00:27:20.957
SAM: Thank you, all right.

00:27:20.957 --> 00:27:22.940
MATT: "I heard that, and I taught it to him."

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.995
TRAVIS: (laughs)
LIAM: He's technically the OG.

00:27:25.995 --> 00:27:27.417
MATT: He places it upon his forehead, too,

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:29.434
and takes it into himself.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.847
As you're gathering things,

00:27:32.847 --> 00:27:34.567
Charlie, over your shoulder.

00:27:34.567 --> 00:27:35.887
"Hello.

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:37.247
"Where are we going?"

00:27:37.247 --> 00:27:38.436
LAURA: Good morning, Charlie.

00:27:38.436 --> 00:27:40.445
MATT: "Good morning. Is it morning?"

00:27:40.445 --> 00:27:42.006
LAURA: I don't know.

00:27:42.006 --> 00:27:43.457
SAM: Caleb, is it morning?

00:27:43.457 --> 00:27:44.360
LIAM: Ah, yes it is.

00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:46.130
MATT: "Yes, it is."

00:27:47.317 --> 00:27:50.900
LAURA: Would you like a
really old cherry tart, Charlie?

00:27:51.438 --> 00:27:53.038
MATT: "I may try one."

00:27:56.121 --> 00:27:57.231
Puts it in his mouth and you watch it

00:27:57.231 --> 00:27:59.911
get gummed into the jaw for a bit.

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:00.744
Pieces are coming out.

00:28:00.744 --> 00:28:02.624
LAURA: What'd you think?
MATT: "Delicious."

00:28:02.624 --> 00:28:07.216
(laughter)

00:28:10.299 --> 00:28:12.193
LIAM: It's weird here in WandaVision.
TRAVIS: You just ruined our friend.

00:28:12.193 --> 00:28:15.111
(laughter)

00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:16.184
TALIESIN: Oh man.

00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:18.391
MARISHA: Okay.

00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:20.921
TALIESIN: This could either go really well or really poorly.

00:28:20.921 --> 00:28:21.754
TRAVIS: Give it a look.

00:28:21.754 --> 00:28:23.237
SAM: All right, me and Fjord are going to

00:28:23.237 --> 00:28:24.811
walk down the hallway.

00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:28.331
I'm going to cautiously inspect the door for traps.

00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:29.841
MATT: Okay, if you both are being quiet,

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:31.291
make a stealth check, please.

00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:34.004
SAM: Stealth.

00:28:34.891 --> 00:28:36.681
TRAVIS: 15.
SAM: 27.

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.225
MATT: Got it, all right.

00:28:38.225 --> 00:28:39.542
And make an investigation.

00:28:40.691 --> 00:28:42.941
SAM: 23.
MATT: 23.

00:28:42.941 --> 00:28:45.501
Does not appear to be trapped nor locked,

00:28:45.501 --> 00:28:47.931
though the door is fairly weighty

00:28:47.931 --> 00:28:51.414
and may require a little bit of physical exertion

00:28:51.414 --> 00:28:54.691
to pry it open enough for somebody to squeeze through.

00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:56.552
SAM: And there's a crack?
MATT: Yeah.

00:28:56.552 --> 00:28:57.801
SAM: Can I peer through the crack?

00:28:57.801 --> 00:28:58.634
MATT: Make a perception--

00:28:58.634 --> 00:29:00.511
SAM: Actually, Fjord, why don't you peer through the crack?

00:29:00.511 --> 00:29:01.721
I can't see shit.

00:29:01.721 --> 00:29:03.804
TRAVIS: Oh, right, that's true.

00:29:05.122 --> 00:29:07.561
17, 20-- 20.

00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:08.514
MATT: 20, not bad.

00:29:09.391 --> 00:29:11.161
Peering through, what you can see,

00:29:12.356 --> 00:29:14.231
faint sources of green light,

00:29:14.231 --> 00:29:16.891
similar illuminating orbs that you've seen

00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:18.451
scattered throughout the ruins.

00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:21.231
There are a handful ahead

00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:24.301
and the street seems to turn

00:29:24.301 --> 00:29:28.221
and then rise up significantly into a jagged top,

00:29:28.221 --> 00:29:29.811
and that's what you're able to see.

00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:30.952
TRAVIS: No movement, no creatures,

00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:32.601
any blood on the ground?

00:29:32.601 --> 00:29:33.811
MATT: From looking through this crack

00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:34.644
with the low light you have, you have

00:29:34.644 --> 00:29:37.128
no way of seeing any sort of blood.

00:29:37.128 --> 00:29:38.381
TRAVIS: Just looks like another hallway

00:29:38.381 --> 00:29:40.391
that turns and raises at the end.

00:29:40.391 --> 00:29:43.518
No bodies, no blood, no nothing.

00:29:43.518 --> 00:29:46.391
SAM: Do you think you and I can open this door?

00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:47.508
You've been working out.

00:29:47.508 --> 00:29:51.548
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, we are more than capable.

00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:52.381
SAM: Okay.

00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:53.614
TRAVIS: You want to give it a--?

00:29:53.614 --> 00:29:54.478
SAM: Let's give it a little--

00:29:54.478 --> 00:29:55.901
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah.

00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:58.153
TRAVIS: Fist bump. (crashes)

00:29:58.153 --> 00:29:59.244
Let's get it.

00:29:59.244 --> 00:30:00.461
MATT: All right, I'll have you guys both roll

00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:03.461
athletics checks for me, please.

00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:05.482
SAM: Ooh.
TRAVIS: Ugh.

00:30:07.081 --> 00:30:08.861
SAM: Wait, I am proficient in it,

00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:10.771
so I can just take a 10, right?

00:30:10.771 --> 00:30:12.611
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Okay, so 15.

00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:13.696
TRAVIS: 14.

00:30:15.676 --> 00:30:18.343
MATT: (creaking)

00:30:19.404 --> 00:30:22.321
It begins to grind open slightly

00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:26.761
and then locks into place.

00:30:26.761 --> 00:30:28.951
It's about three inches open.

00:30:28.951 --> 00:30:30.901
SAM: Well, the door is broken, is the problem.

00:30:30.901 --> 00:30:33.051
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't think it had anything to do with us.

00:30:33.051 --> 00:30:34.408
It's mechanical failure.

00:30:34.408 --> 00:30:37.961
SAM: Or some sort of-- those monsters trapped it

00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:39.998
or rigged it so that it couldn't open any further.

00:30:39.998 --> 00:30:40.897
TRAVIS: I think so.

00:30:40.897 --> 00:30:42.523
It's only been here for hundreds of years.

00:30:42.523 --> 00:30:44.881
SAM: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: I blame them.

00:30:44.881 --> 00:30:45.828
Should we get Yasha?

00:30:45.828 --> 00:30:47.281
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: And Jester.

00:30:47.281 --> 00:30:48.741
SAM: Anyone else but us, yes.

00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:51.420
(laughter)

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.781
MATT: All right.

00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:55.688
So the rest of you, are you following down this tunnel?

00:30:55.688 --> 00:30:57.181
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

00:30:57.181 --> 00:30:58.411
ASHLEY: Do you need assistance?

00:30:58.411 --> 00:30:59.345
SAM: Ladies?
ASHLEY: It looks like--

00:30:59.345 --> 00:31:01.121
SAM: If you wouldn't mind.

00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:02.391
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's go.
LAURA: Together?

00:31:02.391 --> 00:31:04.873
ASHLEY: Yep.
LAURA and ASHLEY: One, two, three.

00:31:04.873 --> 00:31:06.221
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Easy peasy.

00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:07.911
MATT: Athletics checks, both of you, please.

00:31:07.911 --> 00:31:10.244
SAM: She says as she rolls a one.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.697
ASHLEY: 19.
SAM: Okay.

00:31:13.697 --> 00:31:14.530
LAURA: Hold on, hold on.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.641
I need my Guidance, where's my d4s?

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:17.474
SAM: Oh no.

00:31:17.474 --> 00:31:18.899
LAURA: What did I do with them?

00:31:23.701 --> 00:31:25.011
A strength check?

00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:26.311
SAM and MATT: Athletics.

00:31:29.491 --> 00:31:31.881
LAURA: 22.

00:31:31.881 --> 00:31:33.201
MATT: As the both of you approach to it,

00:31:33.201 --> 00:31:35.041
you push and push and you see the hinge

00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:37.063
that got caught begins to

00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:38.658
(creaking)

00:31:38.658 --> 00:31:40.351
(ping) and just snaps.

00:31:40.351 --> 00:31:42.269
Some sort of screw goes flying backwards.

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:43.342
You hear it dangling against--
TRAVIS: Ah!

00:31:43.342 --> 00:31:45.811
(laughter)

00:31:45.811 --> 00:31:48.491
MATT: As the door shifts (heavy impact)

00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:51.921
and swings on the hinge in the corner it's on

00:31:51.921 --> 00:31:53.614
and actually slams into ground, causing

00:31:53.614 --> 00:31:55.341
dirt and dust to fly up around you.

00:31:55.341 --> 00:31:56.972
As it settles for a moment,

00:31:56.972 --> 00:31:58.501
it's a little odd.

00:31:58.501 --> 00:31:59.691
You might have to climb over it a bit,

00:31:59.691 --> 00:32:03.691
but you now have a view ahead of what lies beyond.

00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:05.267
MARISHA: Hell yeah.
LIAM: That was loud.

00:32:05.267 --> 00:32:06.368
MARISHA: That was amazing, babe.

00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:07.694
ASHLEY: Thank you, baby.
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a very

00:32:07.694 --> 00:32:10.941
slow spin to see if anything reacted to that.

00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:11.981
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:14.154
TRAVIS: What's that in the road?

00:32:14.154 --> 00:32:16.150
ASHLEY, SAM, and TRAVIS: A head.
TALIESIN: 27.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.441
MATT: What's that?
TALIESIN: 27.

00:32:17.441 --> 00:32:21.749
MATT: 27. Nothing behind you seems to be shifting, moving,

00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:24.051
or out of the ordinary.

00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:24.884
TALIESIN: All right.

00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:28.714
MATT: So pushing past these heavy brass doors,

00:32:30.121 --> 00:32:34.341
you reveal an area of surprisingly bright lighting ahead.

00:32:34.341 --> 00:32:36.351
The little pinhole space you could see,

00:32:36.351 --> 00:32:38.431
you had a bit of that light glow,

00:32:38.431 --> 00:32:39.571
but now that you step into it,

00:32:39.571 --> 00:32:42.371
this is similar to the Praesidis Ward,

00:32:42.371 --> 00:32:45.091
another open neighborhood.

00:32:45.091 --> 00:32:48.881
This is what looks to be thousands and thousands of feet

00:32:48.881 --> 00:32:51.871
of rolling broken neighborhood.

00:32:51.871 --> 00:32:55.391
Streets bind up into structures and buildings.

00:32:55.391 --> 00:32:59.029
But what's unique about this very--

00:32:59.029 --> 00:33:01.981
what would be an awe-inspiring industrious center

00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:03.181
of this ward of the city,

00:33:05.581 --> 00:33:10.191
is in the mass center of it,

00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:15.191
everything bends upward and then ends in a jagged point,

00:33:15.607 --> 00:33:18.631
almost like something detonated from beneath.

00:33:18.631 --> 00:33:23.631
And the exterior of the crater is twisted upward

00:33:23.891 --> 00:33:26.181
and left at an end point.

00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:27.361
MARISHA: Does it look natural?

00:33:27.361 --> 00:33:30.184
Does it look like it's frozen in time?

00:33:30.184 --> 00:33:31.841
MATT: You could probably get close to investigate it,

00:33:31.841 --> 00:33:35.811
but it looks like it's the aftermath

00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:39.991
of some sort of catastrophic explosion.

00:33:39.991 --> 00:33:42.871
TRAVIS: Buildings in the distance are rolling up?

00:33:42.871 --> 00:33:45.371
MATT: Like the floor itself they were built upon

00:33:45.371 --> 00:33:49.061
is rolling up and then ending as it got blown outward

00:33:49.061 --> 00:33:50.801
or destroyed from some point.

00:33:50.801 --> 00:33:53.031
But it looks like the ground itself is unnaturally forced

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.951
into this somewhat conical position

00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:57.023
before it is just ending.

00:33:57.023 --> 00:33:59.461
LAURA: So something exploded from underneath it.

00:33:59.461 --> 00:34:00.421
MATT: It's possible.

00:34:00.421 --> 00:34:02.247
From this distance, you can't quite make out anything.

00:34:02.247 --> 00:34:04.625
LIAM: It's in the center of this area that we're looking at?

00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:07.271
TRAVIS: Distance from us to the lip,

00:34:07.271 --> 00:34:08.611
if we had to ballpark it?

00:34:08.611 --> 00:34:10.181
MATT: About 150, 200 feet.

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:12.853
LIAM: You know, when you drop a stone into a pond

00:34:12.853 --> 00:34:15.001
and it goes in but then it goes bloop

00:34:15.001 --> 00:34:16.751
up in the middle and shoots upward.

00:34:18.248 --> 00:34:20.488
SAM: Charlie, is this the Genesis Ward?

00:34:22.021 --> 00:34:23.509
MATT: "I think so.

00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:27.821
"It looks a little different than I remember."

00:34:27.821 --> 00:34:29.671
TALIESIN: That's fair.
LIAM: What has changed?

00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:32.341
MATT: "All of it."

00:34:32.341 --> 00:34:35.411
And he points outward towards the destruction

00:34:35.411 --> 00:34:36.954
that lies frozen before you.

00:34:38.818 --> 00:34:39.726
TRAVIS: Charlie, do you remember

00:34:39.726 --> 00:34:41.561
any of your previous companions

00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:43.418
or masters or--?

00:34:45.978 --> 00:34:47.417
MATT: "Attempting to access--"

00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:48.917
(clicking, electricity sparking)

00:34:48.917 --> 00:34:53.025
"I-I-I--

00:34:54.518 --> 00:34:56.211
"Hello."

00:34:56.211 --> 00:34:57.571
TRAVIS: Hi, Charlie.

00:34:57.571 --> 00:34:58.631
Good to see you.

00:34:59.518 --> 00:35:02.764
MATT: "It appears I am a bit damaged.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.073
"Hello."

00:35:06.073 --> 00:35:08.608
TALIESIN: That's what we're here to deal with.

00:35:08.608 --> 00:35:10.478
MATT: "Thank you."
TALIESIN: Mm.

00:35:10.478 --> 00:35:14.311
SAM: Let's walk through and see what we can find.

00:35:14.311 --> 00:35:15.354
MARISHA: What is this room?

00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:18.611
You said it was streets.

00:35:19.478 --> 00:35:22.341
MATT: This is an extension of the actual city itself,

00:35:22.341 --> 00:35:25.461
but this particular space, it looks more industrious

00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:27.551
as opposed to the smaller homesteads and structures.

00:35:27.551 --> 00:35:28.684
This has larger,

00:35:32.278 --> 00:35:33.606
seemingly--

00:35:34.621 --> 00:35:36.064
TRAVIS: Manufacturing?
MATT: Kind of.

00:35:36.064 --> 00:35:37.951
It's hard to describe based on the experiences

00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:40.391
you've had in your life and past.

00:35:40.391 --> 00:35:42.671
They look like smaller fortresses.

00:35:42.671 --> 00:35:43.851
MARISHA: Right, okay.

00:35:43.851 --> 00:35:47.261
MATT: Defensible, to an extent, though not as detailed.

00:35:47.261 --> 00:35:49.371
There are some elements of integrated design in entryways,

00:35:49.371 --> 00:35:52.721
but a lot of it seems to be more for function than beauty.

00:35:52.721 --> 00:35:55.074
As opposed to the previous ward that you walked through.

00:35:55.982 --> 00:35:59.047
And that's just from what you can glean at this perspective.

00:35:59.047 --> 00:36:01.134
Once again, you do not have a lot of light

00:36:01.134 --> 00:36:03.911
aside from just this entryway and where the edge of this is.

00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:06.351
It's brighter than the previously pitch black spaces

00:36:06.351 --> 00:36:07.291
you've been in.

00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:09.574
TRAVIS: Can we see the cavern ceiling at all?

00:36:09.574 --> 00:36:11.491
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:14.874
TRAVIS: 11.

00:36:16.161 --> 00:36:17.054
MATT: Not really.

00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:18.931
TRAVIS: Pretty dark.

00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:20.297
MATT: Though you do see a few

00:36:20.297 --> 00:36:23.297
faint bits of green light fading

00:36:23.297 --> 00:36:25.711
or faded light up in the ceiling at a distance.

00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:26.861
You can't quite tell how far away,

00:36:26.861 --> 00:36:30.201
but it's not quite illuminating anything to catch your eye.

00:36:30.201 --> 00:36:33.321
LIAM: I'm going to lower the globules down in our path

00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:36.811
by our feet and try to see if there's any drops of blood

00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:40.151
or tracks or anything left behind by our friends.

00:36:40.151 --> 00:36:43.818
MATT: Make an investigation or perception check.

00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:46.801
LIAM: Oh, that's be a natural one.

00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:52.674
MATT: Hard to really find anything in this space.

00:36:53.661 --> 00:36:56.401
Partially because the chaos ahead of you

00:36:56.401 --> 00:36:59.061
has covered this area with a very fine layer

00:36:59.061 --> 00:37:00.476
of silt and rubble.

00:37:00.476 --> 00:37:03.059
LIAM: (sighs)

00:37:04.078 --> 00:37:05.391
TRAVIS: We press forward.

00:37:05.391 --> 00:37:08.218
We need to find some sort of a trail.

00:37:11.168 --> 00:37:12.321
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

00:37:12.321 --> 00:37:15.361
LIAM: They used to take a peek at us regularly.

00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:16.997
Is there any use in--

00:37:16.997 --> 00:37:18.301
LAURA: Doing the same?

00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:20.411
LIAM: Yeah, and get a sense of their surroundings,

00:37:20.411 --> 00:37:22.221
have changed or not.

00:37:22.221 --> 00:37:23.781
TRAVIS: Last time we looked they were surrounded

00:37:23.781 --> 00:37:25.851
by that yellowish light, right?

00:37:25.851 --> 00:37:26.691
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:37:26.691 --> 00:37:28.331
We haven't even gotten there yet.

00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:29.656
LAURA: I don't think it's worth

00:37:29.656 --> 00:37:32.251
wasting a spell that high just

00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:34.062
to potentially find out.

00:37:34.062 --> 00:37:36.091
LIAM: What if there are three ways out of this place?

00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:39.191
LAURA: Well, there are multiple things we could do.

00:37:39.191 --> 00:37:44.191
I mean, Caduceus, did you take Find the Path today?

00:37:44.338 --> 00:37:48.661
TALIESIN: I don't have the-- Did I take Find the Path?

00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:49.494
Meant to.

00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:53.761
LAURA: It's just--

00:37:56.466 --> 00:37:58.311
TALIESIN: I don't know if I remembered to.
LAURA: Oh.

00:37:58.311 --> 00:38:00.731
An object from the location you wish to find.

00:38:00.731 --> 00:38:02.131
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, then no.

00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:04.601
LAURA: But I mean, I guess the threshold crest, though,

00:38:04.601 --> 00:38:06.171
would be from--

00:38:06.171 --> 00:38:07.884
TALIESIN: Not necessarily.
LAURA: That's true.

00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:11.189
TRAVIS: Go back that way.

00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:12.741
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:38:12.741 --> 00:38:14.281
TALIESIN: Yeah, nothing I really see here.

00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:16.409
I actually didn't take it anyway.

00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:20.251
LIAM: Well, at a minimum, maybe we ease our way forward

00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:22.091
and see if anyone has better luck than I did.

00:38:22.091 --> 00:38:23.481
LAURA: I have Locate Object.

00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:26.001
So if we get within a thousand feet of them

00:38:26.001 --> 00:38:28.040
I'll know which direction to go.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:28.921
LIAM: Okay.

00:38:28.921 --> 00:38:30.571
MARISHA: Is it taboo if I attempt to see

00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:32.446
if I can find anything

00:38:32.446 --> 00:38:34.171
where Caleb failed?

00:38:34.171 --> 00:38:36.757
MATT: You could attempt the second backup since there

00:38:36.757 --> 00:38:40.809
weren't any additional attempts or assistance.

00:38:40.809 --> 00:38:41.775
MARISHA: Let's see what I got.

00:38:41.775 --> 00:38:44.041
LIAM: Still keeping my globules, though.
MARISHA: Investigation?

00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:44.881
TRAVIS: No fucking way.

00:38:44.881 --> 00:38:46.204
MARISHA: I rolled a two.

00:38:47.101 --> 00:38:47.934
MATT: For a total of?

00:38:47.934 --> 00:38:51.381
MARISHA: For a-- I mean, luckily, my investigation is good.

00:38:51.381 --> 00:38:52.831
For a total of 14.

00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:53.664
MATT: 14.

00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:56.981
No luck, no luck.

00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:00.781
This space has seen strangely

00:39:00.781 --> 00:39:03.861
even more destruction in the Praesidis Ward.

00:39:03.861 --> 00:39:08.771
And as such, the ground, the debris, the topography

00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:11.781
makes it hard to follow any sort of patterns or color.

00:39:11.781 --> 00:39:13.781
Especially with that dull green light matched

00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:17.241
with whatever the radiant light that you were creating.

00:39:17.241 --> 00:39:18.841
It's just an odd place to try and pick out

00:39:18.841 --> 00:39:20.251
something so minuscule.

00:39:20.251 --> 00:39:21.988
LIAM: Got to love that investigation bonus, though.

00:39:21.988 --> 00:39:24.413
TALIESIN: Charlie, if you see anything that looks familiar

00:39:24.413 --> 00:39:26.744
to you, please feel free to speak up.

00:39:28.111 --> 00:39:29.534
If anything you want to see

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:31.588
or just want to get a better idea of.

00:39:31.588 --> 00:39:34.378
MATT: "All right, I'll keep my eyes out."

00:39:34.378 --> 00:39:35.551
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:39:35.551 --> 00:39:40.051
MATT: He starts scanning over Jester as you guys walk.

00:39:40.051 --> 00:39:42.667
MARISHA: So you said there were--
TALIESIN: Any port in a storm.

00:39:42.667 --> 00:39:45.250
MARISHA: What's our options here?

00:39:46.846 --> 00:39:50.971
MATT: There is, where the jagged edges

00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:53.221
of this opening, you imagine.

00:39:53.221 --> 00:39:55.750
You can only just peer a little bit past elements

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:56.624
of it that are close by.

00:39:56.624 --> 00:39:59.331
And you can see distant similarly jagged points

00:39:59.331 --> 00:40:00.641
that come to an end.

00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:03.831
But you're uncertain if it's a pit, if it's a void,

00:40:03.831 --> 00:40:06.191
if it's a straight across or a small divot.

00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:07.431
You don't have the perspective yet.

00:40:07.431 --> 00:40:10.297
But you can go around it or you can--

00:40:10.297 --> 00:40:11.988
LAURA: Go up in it.
MATT: Go back, or--

00:40:11.988 --> 00:40:13.361
You can do that, too. Up to you.

00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:15.835
LIAM: I am curious. It could be the way they went.

00:40:15.835 --> 00:40:16.711
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:40:16.711 --> 00:40:18.371
LIAM: Not necessarily, but we should look.

00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:20.171
MARISHA: Are we trying to duck into any

00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:21.904
of these buildings and see

00:40:21.904 --> 00:40:23.211
if we can repair Charlie?

00:40:23.211 --> 00:40:24.044
Is that a thing?

00:40:24.044 --> 00:40:26.951
SAM: If Charlie recognizes a place, then yes.

00:40:26.951 --> 00:40:28.234
TALIESIN: We can also just poke our head into

00:40:28.234 --> 00:40:29.717
a couple of places as we walk.

00:40:29.717 --> 00:40:32.991
I mean, since we have nothing else to go on

00:40:32.991 --> 00:40:36.301
I figure they must've found this place by accident.

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:39.384
So just trying to be curious about something is

00:40:39.384 --> 00:40:42.508
probably going to be the best course of action.

00:40:42.508 --> 00:40:43.341
LIAM: And learn what we can.

00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:46.051
I'm not going to use Comprehend Languages now,

00:40:46.051 --> 00:40:50.595
but I'm keeping my eyes out for any words or language.

00:40:50.595 --> 00:40:51.799
MATT: Fair enough.

00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:57.001
So you're heading around? Towards? Whereabouts?

00:40:57.001 --> 00:40:59.346
MARISHA: Let's head towards the crater for now, yeah.

00:40:59.346 --> 00:41:02.071
TALIESIN: And if any of the houses look relatively intact

00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:03.981
just poking our heads in, if possible.

00:41:03.981 --> 00:41:07.681
MATT: Okay. Walking through, most of the buildings here

00:41:07.681 --> 00:41:11.721
have been reduced to elements of the base walls

00:41:11.721 --> 00:41:14.874
and just broken nothingness.

00:41:15.731 --> 00:41:17.914
This area definitely seems to be some of the

00:41:17.914 --> 00:41:22.271
heaviest hit of anything that you've seen so far,

00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:25.844
which, of what you've seen of Aeor to this point.

00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:32.044
Caduceus.

00:41:35.107 --> 00:41:37.974
About two or three minutes into walking,

00:41:40.859 --> 00:41:42.321
a sound catches your ear.

00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:43.154
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

00:41:46.831 --> 00:41:51.064
MATT: It's like a faint hissing sound?

00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:55.594
It's consistent with some variation.

00:41:56.771 --> 00:41:57.994
TALIESIN: Is it moving?

00:41:59.051 --> 00:42:00.661
MATT: No, it feels pretty stationary.

00:42:00.661 --> 00:42:01.974
It's ahead of you.

00:42:06.018 --> 00:42:10.897
TALIESIN: There's a snaky sound coming from over there.

00:42:10.897 --> 00:42:12.718
TRAVIS: Snaky sound?
TALIESIN: It's like a--

00:42:12.718 --> 00:42:13.638
LIAM: Gas leak?

00:42:13.638 --> 00:42:15.158
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I--
LIAM: Smell anything?

00:42:15.158 --> 00:42:17.188
LAURA: Or like a slithery sort of sound?

00:42:17.188 --> 00:42:19.680
TALIESIN: Slither-- like (hissing).

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.676
ASHLEY: Inside the crater?

00:42:21.676 --> 00:42:23.361
MATT: The general direction.

00:42:23.361 --> 00:42:24.818
ASHLEY: The general direction.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:42:24.818 --> 00:42:26.331
TALIESIN: It's not moving.

00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:29.621
LIAM: Slightly concerned about natural gases.

00:42:29.621 --> 00:42:31.438
TALIESIN: But worth noting.

00:42:33.511 --> 00:42:34.894
Don't smell anything, do I?

00:42:36.433 --> 00:42:39.641
MATT: No, nothing like a natural gas leak.

00:42:39.641 --> 00:42:40.864
TALIESIN: Okay and it doesn't--

00:42:41.881 --> 00:42:44.141
It's changing a little bit.

00:42:44.141 --> 00:42:47.821
Does it sound organic or mechanical, I suppose?

00:42:47.821 --> 00:42:49.200
MATT: It's hard to tell at this distance.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.071
You have to get closer.

00:42:50.071 --> 00:42:51.204
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:42:51.204 --> 00:42:52.387
SAM: Let's go close.

00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:57.870
MATT: You carefully begin to move forward as a group,

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.991
and as you do, some of you begin to pick up some elements

00:43:00.991 --> 00:43:02.364
of that same sound.

00:43:03.251 --> 00:43:04.084
Caduceus.

00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:07.931
What initially was this faint hissing becomes

00:43:09.254 --> 00:43:11.822
a faint trickle.

00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:17.994
Like gently rushing water.

00:43:19.981 --> 00:43:21.911
LAURA: (gasps)
MARISHA: They were by water.

00:43:21.911 --> 00:43:23.036
LAURA: They were by water.

00:43:23.036 --> 00:43:24.802
SAM: They were right here.

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:29.111
TALIESIN: I think I hear where we're supposed to go.

00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:32.271
There's a watery, drippy sound.

00:43:32.271 --> 00:43:33.731
Are we going up the hill

00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:35.541
or are we going down around it right now?

00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:37.791
LIAM: We're going to have to rule it out.

00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:40.134
MATT: Okay. So you're climbing as it begins to--

00:43:40.134 --> 00:43:41.794
LAURA: How high of a climb is it? I mean--

00:43:41.794 --> 00:43:43.836
MATT: I mean--
LIAM: Is it precarious?

00:43:43.836 --> 00:43:45.131
MATT: It's a little precarious

00:43:45.131 --> 00:43:49.731
as it is a shattered part of the ground.

00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:52.521
But as long as whoever's leading the charge on this

00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:55.006
can hopefully lead it safely.

00:43:55.006 --> 00:43:57.571
There are multiple checks you can do.
LAURA: Yeah, how about you do this, Beau?

00:43:57.571 --> 00:43:59.781
MARISHA: Yeah. I'll dart up to the side

00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:02.051
and I'll start looking for natural footholds

00:44:02.051 --> 00:44:05.281
as I start scaling it and seeing what makes sense.

00:44:05.281 --> 00:44:07.563
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics, your choice.

00:44:07.563 --> 00:44:10.705
MARISHA: I will do-- let's see.

00:44:10.705 --> 00:44:13.371
SAM: Matt, is it like a quarter pipe?

00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:16.858
Or does it stop before it gets like--

00:44:16.858 --> 00:44:19.261
MATT: Some elements do curve almost vertically.

00:44:19.261 --> 00:44:20.601
But some do not.

00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:23.361
It's a very-- It's an odd--

00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:26.261
For something that is so massive, the shape that it's taken

00:44:26.261 --> 00:44:29.701
in the sheer level of astronomical damage here

00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:31.191
is nothing you've ever witnessed.

00:44:31.191 --> 00:44:36.191
And elements of it make little sense

00:44:36.198 --> 00:44:38.554
in the way that it's held there.

00:44:38.554 --> 00:44:41.211
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Mm, 16.

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.401
Rough rolls today.

00:44:42.401 --> 00:44:44.411
MATT: 16, not too bad, though.
MARISHA: It's okay.

00:44:44.411 --> 00:44:46.553
MATT: A little precarious, but you manage to dart.

00:44:46.553 --> 00:44:48.118
Are you using acrobatics?

00:44:48.118 --> 00:44:48.951
MARISHA: They're the same.

00:44:48.951 --> 00:44:50.631
So I'll use acrobatics.

00:44:50.631 --> 00:44:52.151
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: It's more flourishy.

00:44:52.151 --> 00:44:52.984
MATT: There you go.

00:44:52.984 --> 00:44:56.873
Leaping from shelf to section to exposed pipe

00:44:56.873 --> 00:44:59.721
to metallic bar, you eventually go up towards an edge

00:44:59.721 --> 00:45:01.904
and grab and look down.

00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:05.422
Now, what you see before you.

00:45:05.422 --> 00:45:07.481
You maybe envisioned something like this,

00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:09.771
but it's different to look down and see it

00:45:11.161 --> 00:45:12.474
physically before you.

00:45:13.481 --> 00:45:17.471
There is a vacuous hole below

00:45:17.471 --> 00:45:21.424
that extends maybe a mile or so across.

00:45:22.571 --> 00:45:24.744
MARISHA: Across?
MATT: Across.

00:45:24.744 --> 00:45:25.681
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:29.323
MATT: It goes down, down, down,

00:45:29.323 --> 00:45:32.517
a deep, rounded crater.

00:45:32.517 --> 00:45:33.441
MARISHA: Does it fall off to black?

00:45:33.441 --> 00:45:34.861
Can I see the bottom?

00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:39.631
MATT: What you do see is there are numerous waterfalls

00:45:39.631 --> 00:45:42.631
from different points that are just trailing down

00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:44.011
and hitting floors.

00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:46.907
When I say floors, this isn't just rock.

00:45:46.907 --> 00:45:47.791
LIAM: It's buildings.

00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:50.161
MATT: You can see beneath the surface of this,

00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:54.001
there is floor after floor after floor of what were once

00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:57.331
subterranean levels of different structures

00:45:57.331 --> 00:46:01.361
of this ward that are now carved open and exposed.

00:46:01.361 --> 00:46:05.041
You can see bits of light glowing inside like a series

00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:07.341
of underground bases that were suddenly

00:46:07.341 --> 00:46:08.754
sheered and abandoned.

00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:12.684
You see probably a dozen or so floors immediately

00:46:12.684 --> 00:46:14.704
with space between.

00:46:14.704 --> 00:46:16.494
TRAVIS: That bunker buster.

00:46:16.494 --> 00:46:18.721
MATT: There are precarious ledges

00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:22.751
and bits of broken and dangerous-looking paths

00:46:22.751 --> 00:46:24.564
that could be treked downward.

00:46:25.571 --> 00:46:27.311
MARISHA: Can I see the bottom in the center of the crater?

00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:28.760
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.979
LIAM: It's like the forgotten city under Manhattan.

00:46:33.111 --> 00:46:34.694
MARISHA: Okay. 14.

00:46:36.921 --> 00:46:39.451
MATT: You cannot quite see what's at the bottom.

00:46:39.451 --> 00:46:42.201
Just disappears in the darkness below.

00:46:42.201 --> 00:46:43.391
MARISHA: Is it a lot of water?

00:46:43.391 --> 00:46:46.491
Like it's pretty astronomical amount of water

00:46:46.491 --> 00:46:48.331
that's heading down?

00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:50.611
MATT: No, it's not massive waterfalls.

00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:52.811
It's a very, very faint trickle.

00:46:52.811 --> 00:46:54.851
You're not quite sure what the source of this water would be

00:46:54.851 --> 00:46:57.481
for how long this ruin has been here

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.691
for it still to be a gentle, steady flow

00:46:59.691 --> 00:47:00.771
in these locations.

00:47:00.771 --> 00:47:02.970
TRAVIS: And it's so fucking cold.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.194
TALIESIN: Lots of ice means lots of water.

00:47:07.695 --> 00:47:08.528
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Which, to that point,

00:47:08.528 --> 00:47:09.769
the temperature is still chilly

00:47:09.769 --> 00:47:11.881
in here, but the temperature continues to fluctuate

00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:13.901
from location to location within here.

00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:16.001
It was so freezing in the exterior and

00:47:16.001 --> 00:47:18.521
in portions of the tunnel that you went before that fight.

00:47:18.521 --> 00:47:19.354
But even in here

00:47:19.354 --> 00:47:24.091
it's maybe the equivalent of like a gentle 40 degrees.

00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:25.789
LAURA: Wow.

00:47:25.789 --> 00:47:29.231
MATT: And that can change 200 feet from where you stand.

00:47:29.231 --> 00:47:30.941
You feel waves of warmth, waves of cold.

00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:32.431
It's unsettling.

00:47:33.631 --> 00:47:35.331
MARISHA: Being up here, can I tell if it looks

00:47:35.331 --> 00:47:38.551
like something cratered in, crashed in,

00:47:38.551 --> 00:47:40.814
or if something exploded up?

00:47:42.631 --> 00:47:43.854
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

00:47:43.854 --> 00:47:45.071
TALIESIN: Hmm!
MARISHA: Come on.

00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.873
Don't fuck me, Gil.

00:47:47.873 --> 00:47:49.290
Natural 20!

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.458
(laughter)

00:47:50.458 --> 00:47:51.533
Yes!

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.446
Uh, okay. Thanks, Gil.
TRAVIS: Thanks, Gil.

00:47:55.446 --> 00:47:57.343
ASHLEY: That was so--

00:47:57.343 --> 00:47:58.731
MARISHA: 32!

00:47:58.731 --> 00:48:00.374
MATT: Such a gentleman, that Gil.

00:48:00.374 --> 00:48:02.051
(laughter)

00:48:02.051 --> 00:48:02.884
MATT: 32.

00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:08.761
In your mind, you immediately begin to imagine

00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:12.001
the city solid, bustling like at once was.

00:48:12.001 --> 00:48:13.941
In your mind's eye you can envision

00:48:13.941 --> 00:48:15.751
this extremely advanced portion

00:48:15.751 --> 00:48:17.161
of this mageocracy of Aeor.

00:48:17.161 --> 00:48:19.211
You can see streets in these large buildings.

00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:21.764
You can see the people going about their business.

00:48:23.971 --> 00:48:28.721
And you can imagine the ground begin to rupture and tear.

00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:31.801
People flung and disintegrated in numerous directions.

00:48:31.801 --> 00:48:34.251
Instantaneously killed, hundreds in one blast.

00:48:34.251 --> 00:48:35.941
And it is a blast you envision.

00:48:35.941 --> 00:48:38.241
You can see this massive explosion

00:48:38.241 --> 00:48:41.441
that throws whole sections of the neighborhood

00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:43.851
into the sky, chunks of what was once underground

00:48:43.851 --> 00:48:46.141
probably thrown from where it was.

00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:47.891
You can see the vast destruction.

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:49.944
This was blown from the inside out.

00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:53.361
MARISHA: Wow. Okay.

00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:56.621
MATT: And with that roll, you can see

00:48:58.719 --> 00:49:01.501
on the southern edge,

00:49:01.501 --> 00:49:04.874
it isn't a continuous circle.

00:49:05.841 --> 00:49:08.311
On the southern edge there is one very different,

00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:10.341
unique groove.

00:49:10.341 --> 00:49:15.341
Like a smooth slide about a hundred feet across.

00:49:15.631 --> 00:49:18.351
Like something had borne with a giant augur

00:49:18.351 --> 00:49:22.381
at an angle inward directly to where the center

00:49:22.381 --> 00:49:26.011
of where this explosion would have initiated.

00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:28.634
MARISHA: Whoa.

00:49:33.001 --> 00:49:34.461
MATT: So whatever triggered this explosion

00:49:34.461 --> 00:49:37.821
you get the sense that something arrived.

00:49:37.821 --> 00:49:42.356
MARISHA: Bore into the ground and then detonated out.

00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:44.629
TALIESIN: Holy cow.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:47.121 --> 00:49:52.121
Okay, how far am I from my party now? From them?

00:49:52.486 --> 00:49:55.171
MATT: You're maybe about 60 feet away from them.

00:49:55.171 --> 00:49:57.551
As another note, too, as you're taking this in,

00:49:57.551 --> 00:50:01.571
imagining this, you glance up, and those bits of green light

00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:04.231
that were witnessed along the ceiling.

00:50:04.231 --> 00:50:06.201
They're moving slightly and you look up

00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:11.201
and you can see dozens and dozens of pieces of rock.

00:50:11.511 --> 00:50:16.511
Chunks of stone, parts of streets just floating

00:50:16.798 --> 00:50:20.164
and gently drifting, locked in place.

00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:24.366
TRAVIS: Gravity.
LAURA: That face, Marisha.

00:50:24.366 --> 00:50:27.518
(laughter)

00:50:27.518 --> 00:50:28.351
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:50:30.144 --> 00:50:30.977
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:35.111 --> 00:50:36.944
I turn around to everybody.

00:50:39.058 --> 00:50:41.550
(whispered) I think this is where we need to go.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:42.751
LIAM: Are you still up at the top?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:50:42.751 --> 00:50:44.151
LIAM: Or down at the bottom?

00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:45.063
(whispered) What?

00:50:45.063 --> 00:50:47.772
(laughter)

00:50:47.772 --> 00:50:50.899
MARISHA: (whispered) I think this is
where I think we got to go in.

00:50:50.899 --> 00:50:52.403
SAM: Go in, go down?

00:50:52.403 --> 00:50:53.858
LIAM: What's in there?

00:50:53.858 --> 00:50:55.198
SAM: Well, let's just go look.

00:50:55.198 --> 00:50:56.891
MARISHA: A city.

00:50:56.891 --> 00:50:59.288
TALIESIN: So why would we climb up if we're going to go--

00:50:59.288 --> 00:51:00.943
LAURA: Do you see any yellow?

00:51:00.943 --> 00:51:02.481
Do you see any yellow rooms?

00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:03.671
TRAVIS: Hundreds of feet up.

00:51:03.671 --> 00:51:04.651
MATT: It's hard for you to tell.

00:51:04.651 --> 00:51:06.051
Make a perception check on this.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:09.161
MARISHA: Do I see any yellow rooms?

00:51:09.161 --> 00:51:10.852
Oh, he's doing--
TRAVIS: 16.

00:51:10.852 --> 00:51:12.366
MATT: 16.

00:51:12.366 --> 00:51:13.281
There are some.

00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.891
The closest to you are probably 70, 80 feet away.

00:51:16.891 --> 00:51:20.201
TRAVIS: Can I just grab a piece of
rock or rubble on the ground?

00:51:20.201 --> 00:51:23.371
And I'm just going to try and wing it up into the air.

00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:26.371
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll a strength check for me,

00:51:26.371 --> 00:51:27.871
if you don't mind.

00:51:30.811 --> 00:51:31.761
TRAVIS: 16.

00:51:31.761 --> 00:51:33.233
MATT: All right.

00:51:33.233 --> 00:51:35.801
(quick whoosh, impact)

00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:37.371
You watch this one piece of rock

00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:38.951
that was just slowly turning

00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:43.111
begins turning slightly more in that direction.

00:51:43.111 --> 00:51:44.261
A slight shift.

00:51:44.261 --> 00:51:45.961
TRAVIS: But the rock that hit it falls?

00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:47.095
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:51:47.095 --> 00:51:49.178
LIAM: Leftover floating rock.

00:51:49.178 --> 00:51:51.698
TALIESIN: So are we going up or down?

00:51:51.698 --> 00:51:53.131
MARISHA: Well, you have to come up here

00:51:53.131 --> 00:51:55.031
and then we're going to go down.

00:51:55.031 --> 00:52:00.031
It's like this, something blew up this crater.

00:52:00.181 --> 00:52:01.862
TALIESIN: I can't hear you all the way upstairs.

00:52:01.862 --> 00:52:02.736
You can't hear me either.

00:52:02.736 --> 00:52:03.955
So I don't know why--

00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:07.878
LAURA: It's mostly water that we can-- I'll climb.

00:52:07.878 --> 00:52:10.766
MARISHA: Yeah. There's a pipe over there.

00:52:10.766 --> 00:52:12.373
And then it's like, if you jump over there--

00:52:12.373 --> 00:52:13.811
MATT: Following her lead, I'd like everybody

00:52:13.811 --> 00:52:15.521
to make an acrobatics check, please.

00:52:15.521 --> 00:52:17.191
LIAM: Before we leave, I'm going to actually

00:52:17.191 --> 00:52:18.311
pick up a rock as well.

00:52:18.311 --> 00:52:21.721
But I'm going to write on a piece of paper,

00:52:21.721 --> 00:52:24.921
wrap the stone and add it to my collection of way points.

00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:29.018
And then I'm going to use my keen memory to use

00:52:29.018 --> 00:52:30.671
the exact footholds and handholds

00:52:30.671 --> 00:52:33.451
that Beauregard took to get to the top.

00:52:33.451 --> 00:52:34.681
MATT: Okay. You know where they are?

00:52:34.681 --> 00:52:35.514
LIAM: Yeah.

00:52:35.514 --> 00:52:36.409
MATT: Still make an acrobatics.

00:52:36.409 --> 00:52:37.242
LIAM: You got it.

00:52:37.242 --> 00:52:39.460
(laughter)

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.914
MATT: If you're following her lead.

00:52:41.756 --> 00:52:44.109
TRAVIS: 11.
LAURA: 18.

00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:45.971
SAM: 20.
MATT: All right.

00:52:45.971 --> 00:52:47.491
ASHLEY: 21.

00:52:47.491 --> 00:52:48.324
TALIESIN: 23.

00:52:48.324 --> 00:52:49.411
TRAVIS: What?
SAM: Wow.

00:52:49.411 --> 00:52:51.591
TALIESIN: Right?
MARISHA: Wow.

00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:52.491
MATT: All right.

00:52:52.491 --> 00:52:54.243
MARISHA: Were you on the gymnastics team?

00:52:54.243 --> 00:52:55.526
TALIESIN: A 17 and then a four on the--

00:52:55.526 --> 00:52:57.001
MATT: A couple of wobbly steps here and there,

00:52:57.001 --> 00:52:59.291
but for the most part you all managed to work in conjunction

00:52:59.291 --> 00:53:00.351
to get to the top without issue.

00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:03.701
And as you all step up-- with I'm actually going to say--

00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:05.021
Not bad actually.

00:53:05.021 --> 00:53:07.781
Essek joins you without issue.

00:53:07.781 --> 00:53:10.271
As you all make your way to the edge and glance

00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:13.381
down to see precisely what Beauregard have been taking in.

00:53:13.381 --> 00:53:16.321
There's that pause as you all let the immensity

00:53:16.321 --> 00:53:19.328
of it wash over you, Essek breaks the silence going,

00:53:19.328 --> 00:53:20.161
"This.

00:53:21.624 --> 00:53:23.791
"I cannot fathom what would cause

00:53:23.791 --> 00:53:26.304
"this level of destruction."

00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:32.181
LIAM: Maybe the tip of a mountain punching up from below.

00:53:32.382 --> 00:53:35.958
Or the fist of a god punching up from below.

00:53:35.958 --> 00:53:39.401
MARISHA: Whatever it was, it wasn't down there.

00:53:39.401 --> 00:53:40.501
It was placed.

00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:44.201
And I point out the bore line from across the way.

00:53:44.201 --> 00:53:45.394
Point out the--

00:53:46.721 --> 00:53:47.554
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

00:53:48.611 --> 00:53:52.661
MATT: Too far to make out much
detail of what may have done it,

00:53:52.661 --> 00:53:56.969
but you can see the definitive smooth punch point

00:53:56.969 --> 00:53:58.441
on that side at an angle.

00:53:58.441 --> 00:53:59.274
LAURA: Wow.

00:54:02.328 --> 00:54:04.103
SAM: So should we go down in there?

00:54:04.103 --> 00:54:05.801
LAURA: Do I see any yellow rooms?

00:54:05.801 --> 00:54:07.968
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:54:09.065 --> 00:54:12.261
LAURA: I'm going to use my holy bomb for my Guidance.

00:54:12.261 --> 00:54:13.094
Ooh!

00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:16.491
A 23.

00:54:16.491 --> 00:54:17.324
MATT: 23.

00:54:18.741 --> 00:54:21.671
On all these levels you see throughout,
a lot of them are dark.

00:54:21.671 --> 00:54:23.591
A few of them have bits of that green light

00:54:23.591 --> 00:54:25.301
and there are different tiers

00:54:25.301 --> 00:54:27.924
that have a similar orange coloration to it.

00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:32.211
A little bit below and to the left of where you are

00:54:32.211 --> 00:54:34.611
about four floors down

00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:39.141
or it would be like three steps of you going

00:54:39.141 --> 00:54:41.131
what you're on, two, three, four.

00:54:41.131 --> 00:54:46.118
You can see there is a yellowish orange interior light.

00:54:46.118 --> 00:54:47.209
LAURA: That looks familiar.

00:54:47.209 --> 00:54:48.576
MARISHA: Yeah, it does.

00:54:48.576 --> 00:54:51.388
LAURA: Okay. How do we get down there?

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.801
SAM: Do we have any rope?

00:54:53.801 --> 00:54:55.141
LAURA: We always have-- wait,

00:54:55.141 --> 00:54:56.388
we didn't grab our-- Did we grab our?

00:54:56.388 --> 00:54:58.891
LIAM: It's buried, semi-buried.

00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:01.221
MATT: Yeah, the two sets of ropes that you previously used

00:55:01.221 --> 00:55:02.691
in the tunnel were left behind.

00:55:02.691 --> 00:55:04.561
So does anybody else have any rope?

00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:05.394
LIAM: I have a rope.

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:09.131
MARISHA: It was mine and Fjord's rope that I think we used.

00:55:09.131 --> 00:55:11.216
LIAM: I've never used mine before, ever.

00:55:11.216 --> 00:55:13.241
ASHLEY: I have rope too.
TRAVIS: Got some pitons.

00:55:13.241 --> 00:55:14.482
LAURA: I don't have any rope.

00:55:14.482 --> 00:55:15.982
(laughter)

00:55:15.982 --> 00:55:17.661
TALIESIN: Clerics don't get ropes.

00:55:17.661 --> 00:55:21.231
LAURA: Yeah. But I have a really beautiful flower crown.

00:55:21.231 --> 00:55:22.347
TALIESIN: I have a rope.

00:55:23.661 --> 00:55:25.961
ASHLEY: Wait, so break this down for me again.

00:55:25.961 --> 00:55:28.001
So the crater, and then the other side of it

00:55:28.001 --> 00:55:30.911
the southern side of it, you said it's like a--

00:55:30.911 --> 00:55:34.691
MATT: So yeah, there's this massive almost mile across

00:55:34.691 --> 00:55:37.334
gauging with-- you know distance in the low light--

00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:39.961
cavernous crater.

00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:43.001
And it is a deep drop into darkness.

00:55:43.001 --> 00:55:44.411
You cannot quite see the bottom.

00:55:45.428 --> 00:55:47.911
And there are multiple layers scattered throughout

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:51.084
at different levels that are all sheered off and exposed.

00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:55.561
On the southern edge it's not quite

00:55:55.561 --> 00:55:56.862
directly across from me, but a little bit

00:55:56.862 --> 00:55:59.511
to the right-hand side from your perspective,

00:55:59.511 --> 00:56:01.501
as opposed to a straight wall,

00:56:01.501 --> 00:56:05.561
you can see a sheared angle inward like a slide

00:56:05.561 --> 00:56:08.584
or something that would just directly drive into the shadow.

00:56:08.584 --> 00:56:10.096
ASHLEY: Okay, that's the part I missed.

00:56:09.987 --> 00:56:11.277
LIAM: I only know the stories

00:56:11.277 --> 00:56:14.480
of how this city came down. Use your imagination.

00:56:17.897 --> 00:56:19.867
SAM: So we got some rope, yeah?

00:56:19.867 --> 00:56:20.833
LAURA: Don't know if it's long enough

00:56:20.833 --> 00:56:22.507
for us to drop four floors, though.

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:25.847
SAM: How much rope do you have? 50 feet?

00:56:25.847 --> 00:56:29.330
ASHLEY: Probably the same length, yeah, 50 feet.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.522
MATT: (as Essek) "And we do have means of manipulating

00:56:31.522 --> 00:56:33.912
"things to distance. If we can affix the rope and

00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:35.717
"just go one floor at a time."

00:56:35.717 --> 00:56:36.601
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

00:56:36.601 --> 00:56:37.927
MATT: "And disable to just be go

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:41.590
"between our particular specialties."

00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:45.508
LIAM: And if, Beauregard,

00:56:45.508 --> 00:56:46.833
and I think you too as well, Essek,

00:56:46.833 --> 00:56:51.292
you didn't seem to have a problem
with that decline yesterday.

00:56:51.292 --> 00:56:54.387
Are the last one's down, you could follow us

00:56:54.387 --> 00:56:55.528
and bring the top of the rope,

00:56:55.528 --> 00:56:57.457
and we could just go bit by bit by bit, as you say.

00:56:57.457 --> 00:56:58.290
MATT: "Indeed."

00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:00.397
TRAVIS: I remember when we used to set traps

00:57:00.397 --> 00:57:02.789
and utilize gravity as part of the weapon

00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:05.050
and yet here we are.

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:07.883
MARISHA and LAURA: (chuckle)

00:57:09.712 --> 00:57:12.087
TALIESIN: Gravity, it'll turn on you.

00:57:12.087 --> 00:57:14.410
MATT: "Well, you just need to make friends."

00:57:15.677 --> 00:57:16.510
TALIESIN: I like that.

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:18.089
LIAM: There's a spell for that.

00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:19.197
LAURA: Let's do it.

00:57:19.197 --> 00:57:20.260
TALIESIN: Always a spell for that.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.797
SAM: All right, one floor at a time.

00:57:22.797 --> 00:57:25.367
I guess we'll rope it down.

00:57:25.367 --> 00:57:26.537
MATT: All right.

00:57:26.537 --> 00:57:27.370
So

00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:30.610
with one rope affixed, that'll-- about 50 feet, you said?

00:57:31.487 --> 00:57:34.417
All right, roughly 35 to 40 feet down

00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:37.297
to the first subterranean floor beneath you.

00:57:37.297 --> 00:57:38.567
Those that are descending

00:57:39.427 --> 00:57:40.507
through climbing means go ahead

00:57:40.507 --> 00:57:42.257
and make an athletics check, please.

00:57:44.747 --> 00:57:45.580
TRAVIS: Come on.

00:57:48.377 --> 00:57:49.210
TALIESIN: Hey!

00:57:50.287 --> 00:57:51.712
LIAM: 15.
LAURA: 15.

00:57:51.712 --> 00:57:52.851
SAM: 15.
TALIESIN: Athletics?

00:57:52.851 --> 00:57:54.317
ASHLEY: Whoa.

00:57:54.317 --> 00:57:55.150
12.

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:56.024
TALIESIN: 13.

00:57:56.024 --> 00:57:56.857
MARISHA: 20.

00:57:56.857 --> 00:57:57.690
TRAVIS: 13.

00:58:02.197 --> 00:58:04.217
MATT: There are some points where the rope

00:58:06.117 --> 00:58:07.447
begins to shift a bit

00:58:07.447 --> 00:58:08.560
and you catch yourself.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.687
(panting)

00:58:09.687 --> 00:58:11.537
Everyone checking in with each other.

00:58:12.387 --> 00:58:13.977
Essek shouts over the edge.

00:58:13.977 --> 00:58:14.827
"Is everyone okay?"

00:58:15.677 --> 00:58:17.357
SAM: Instinctively, I grab

00:58:17.357 --> 00:58:19.706
for Fjord's hair to try to hold onto something.

00:58:19.706 --> 00:58:22.248
(laughter)

00:58:22.248 --> 00:58:23.501
MATT: Glides through.

00:58:23.501 --> 00:58:25.109
SAM: (quiet struggling)

00:58:26.123 --> 00:58:27.447
LIAM: Veth just falls.

00:58:27.447 --> 00:58:29.245
TRAVIS: Stop! Stop, stop it.

00:58:29.245 --> 00:58:31.716
(laughter)

00:58:31.716 --> 00:58:33.142
You know it's not there!

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:35.472
(laughter)

00:58:35.472 --> 00:58:37.307
MATT: But as the adrenaline begins to subside,

00:58:37.307 --> 00:58:39.357
you slowly begin your descent once more

00:58:39.357 --> 00:58:42.817
and safely make your way to the first ledge

00:58:42.817 --> 00:58:46.097
into what would be considered the first basement floor

00:58:46.097 --> 00:58:49.950
of this climb into the Genesis Ward.

00:58:52.387 --> 00:58:53.837
First thing.
LAURA: Oh no.

00:58:53.837 --> 00:58:57.067
MATT: After Essek drifts down with the end of rope

00:58:57.067 --> 00:58:58.530
and hands it over to Yasha,

00:58:59.767 --> 00:59:01.827
you notice where this ledge is,

00:59:01.827 --> 00:59:05.910
it opens into an open hall.

00:59:07.617 --> 00:59:10.367
It looks like there is one faint, orange,

00:59:10.367 --> 00:59:12.987
glowing light source in here that is still functioning,

00:59:12.987 --> 00:59:16.160
and the rest of it is in heavy stages of shadow.

00:59:17.467 --> 00:59:20.227
But this was an open hall with desks and chairs

00:59:20.227 --> 00:59:23.027
and other bits of furniture that had been thrown around.

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:24.987
You can-- it's odd.

00:59:24.987 --> 00:59:27.667
You can see where the edge of this ledge would be.

00:59:27.667 --> 00:59:31.497
There are large installed bookcases

00:59:32.597 --> 00:59:35.347
that are just sheared off where the explosion happened.

00:59:36.287 --> 00:59:38.037
And it looks like there are remnants

00:59:38.037 --> 00:59:42.960
of tomes that have just been burned to cinders and ash.

00:59:43.797 --> 00:59:45.197
ASHLEY: Were you here before?

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:51.897
MATT: There are also dozens and dozens

00:59:51.897 --> 00:59:56.897
and dozens of bodies scattered all across the ground here.

00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:03.747
LIAM: Just ancient, semi-mummified.

01:00:03.747 --> 01:00:06.317
Yeah, I'm standing at the edge

01:00:06.317 --> 01:00:08.067
and looking out into the crater.

01:00:08.067 --> 01:00:10.917
We see a little bit of orange light here

01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:11.857
if we were to keep going in.

01:00:11.857 --> 01:00:14.627
But if we strain to look lower or at other parts

01:00:14.627 --> 01:00:17.517
of the crater, is there anything similar anywhere else?

01:00:17.517 --> 01:00:20.137
MATT: You can see the next one down appears to be--

01:00:20.137 --> 01:00:22.837
You can see there's additional ledge and another floor

01:00:22.837 --> 01:00:25.757
maybe about 20, 30 feet below where you are now,

01:00:25.757 --> 01:00:27.907
but there is no light source in that one.

01:00:27.907 --> 01:00:29.897
And there's a very small ledge.

01:00:29.897 --> 01:00:30.897
And then below that,

01:00:30.897 --> 01:00:34.820
the next one has a brighter orange-ish lit coloration to it.

01:00:36.647 --> 01:00:39.057
Within this room, beyond the bodies

01:00:39.057 --> 01:00:41.117
you can see there is a distant door

01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:43.410
that is currently closed and locked off.

01:00:44.827 --> 01:00:45.660
Pardon me.

01:00:47.348 --> 01:00:49.147
And what looks to be another open chamber

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:50.980
on the right hand side of this room.

01:00:53.287 --> 01:00:56.289
LAURA: Don't you just want to explore everything?

01:00:56.289 --> 01:00:57.167
SAM: Of course.

01:00:57.167 --> 01:00:59.517
TRAVIS: Check everybody for key cards and weapons.

01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:00.497
TALIESIN: You can still talk to people.

01:01:00.497 --> 01:01:01.330
TRAVIS: Currency.

01:01:02.687 --> 01:01:06.327
LIAM: No books left intact?

01:01:06.327 --> 01:01:08.767
MATT: Not on this side of the chamber, no.

01:01:08.767 --> 01:01:09.600
TALIESIN: This side.

01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:12.507
SAM: I'll just go peek through the door.

01:01:12.507 --> 01:01:15.007
LIAM: Well, we'll have to check it off the list.

01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:18.027
SAM: All right, I'll go to the open door, look for traps.

01:01:18.027 --> 01:01:18.860
MATT: Okay.

01:01:19.807 --> 01:01:22.417
As you stroll across the open chamber,

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:24.137
go ahead and roll in an investigation check.

01:01:24.137 --> 01:01:24.970
SAM: 23.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.890
MATT: 23.
SAM: Always 23.

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:28.264
MATT: And is this the closed door or the open one?

01:01:28.264 --> 01:01:29.097
SAM: The open one.

01:01:29.097 --> 01:01:29.930
MATT: Open one.

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.687
SAM: I'm not a crazy person.

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:34.197
MATT: Right, so you can see there was a door

01:01:34.197 --> 01:01:37.117
that was affixed here, and there is damage to where it was.

01:01:37.117 --> 01:01:39.087
It has been pushed inward and shattered.

01:01:39.087 --> 01:01:40.497
It looks like something was jettisoned

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:43.137
from whatever explosion happened and threw it

01:01:43.137 --> 01:01:45.467
into this door, breaking it into four or five pieces.

01:01:45.467 --> 01:01:48.147
And they're scattered in the ground on the inside.

01:01:48.147 --> 01:01:49.777
But the entryway that you're currently

01:01:49.777 --> 01:01:51.967
at does not appear to be trapped.

01:01:51.967 --> 01:01:54.820
SAM: Okay. I will go through it and look around.

01:01:55.787 --> 01:01:59.027
MATT: Glancing inside, this is a storage room.

01:01:59.027 --> 01:02:02.837
You can see there are all manner of stone boxes,

01:02:02.837 --> 01:02:07.357
metallic crates, or storage bins, shelves that are filled

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:11.107
with glass jars and small bags.

01:02:11.107 --> 01:02:15.357
This is a fairly well-intact storage room.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:16.335
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

01:02:17.927 --> 01:02:19.757
SAM: I better look inside some of the things.

01:02:19.757 --> 01:02:21.807
LAURA: Are there any potions or anything?

01:02:21.807 --> 01:02:23.887
MARISHA: Any robot legs?

01:02:23.887 --> 01:02:24.780
SAM: Storage?

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.434
TRAVIS: 1,000 year old potions.

01:02:28.434 --> 01:02:29.267
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:32.217
SAM: I will look around through some of these items.

01:02:32.217 --> 01:02:34.347
MATT: All right, so you guys see Veth disappear

01:02:34.347 --> 01:02:37.377
into the back storage chamber, and is gone.

01:02:37.377 --> 01:02:41.188
SAM: Storage chambers, it's like office supplies. 23.

01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:42.567
LIAM: I'm going to creep after her.

01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:45.767
MATT: Okay, and you see Veth is now rummaging

01:02:45.767 --> 01:02:47.787
through the contents of the room?

01:02:47.787 --> 01:02:49.497
LIAM: Are you being careful?

01:02:49.497 --> 01:02:51.470
SAM: I mean, it doesn't look like--

01:02:52.647 --> 01:02:53.817
Sure.

01:02:53.817 --> 01:02:56.337
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for anything

01:02:56.337 --> 01:03:01.257
moving or any sounds outside of Veth's shuffling and--

01:03:01.257 --> 01:03:02.557
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:03:04.537 --> 01:03:05.370
TALIESIN: I'll assist.

01:03:08.457 --> 01:03:09.577
SAM: Three dice?

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:11.603
LAURA: I was rolling my Guidance.

01:03:13.087 --> 01:03:14.287
TRAVIS: It's a huge Guidance.

01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:15.910
LAURA: I know, it's the holy bomb.

01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:19.517
SAM and TRAVIS: Holy bomb.

01:03:19.517 --> 01:03:21.017
LAURA: 19.

01:03:21.017 --> 01:03:22.427
MATT: 19, not too bad.

01:03:22.427 --> 01:03:25.487
You do not hear any other sounds in the vicinity

01:03:25.487 --> 01:03:28.670
beyond Veth currently rummaging through that chamber.

01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:33.777
A short glance through here, and looking about,

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.527
most of the materials in here are spell components.

01:03:36.527 --> 01:03:37.360
SAM: Spell components?

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.997
MATT: Yeah, you begin to recognize

01:03:38.997 --> 01:03:39.997
some of these jars and bits.

01:03:39.997 --> 01:03:42.677
This is baseline components.

01:03:42.677 --> 01:03:44.407
Nothing too expensive.

01:03:44.407 --> 01:03:49.407
But for any sort of simple non-consumed

01:03:49.597 --> 01:03:50.927
spell components required,

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:53.417
there are just rows and rows
of them in different containers.

01:03:53.417 --> 01:03:54.387
And they're labeled

01:03:54.387 --> 01:03:57.427
in a language that you do not understand.

01:03:57.427 --> 01:03:58.407
SAM: But I recognize the items.

01:03:58.407 --> 01:03:59.397
MATT: But you recognize the items.

01:03:59.397 --> 01:04:01.397
You can see mummified wings,

01:04:01.397 --> 01:04:03.417
you can see ground dusts.

01:04:03.417 --> 01:04:04.508
You can see pastes.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:08.847
You can see viscous liquids in capped bottles,

01:04:08.847 --> 01:04:11.887
all manner of strange material components just

01:04:11.887 --> 01:04:13.567
stored within this chamber.

01:04:13.567 --> 01:04:16.180
SAM: Okay. So it's like a magic office.

01:04:17.259 --> 01:04:18.417
LIAM: What did you find?

01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:21.487
SAM: It's all base level magic components, you know.

01:04:21.487 --> 01:04:23.887
Like basic-ass shit.

01:04:23.887 --> 01:04:27.157
Eye of newt, you know,

01:04:27.157 --> 01:04:28.707
oil of the poppy.

01:04:28.707 --> 01:04:29.907
LIAM: Seeing all the writing.

01:04:29.907 --> 01:04:33.137
I will wave a hand through the air and sprinkle salt

01:04:33.137 --> 01:04:35.567
in front of my vision and cast Comprehend Languages.

01:04:35.567 --> 01:04:37.387
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: So that I can read.

01:04:37.387 --> 01:04:38.220
MATT: Yeah, indeed.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.947
You connect to all these different components here

01:04:40.947 --> 01:04:42.047
and they're labeled appropriately.

01:04:42.047 --> 01:04:43.547
Although a lot of them have been damaged

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:47.887
from the impact to the city.

01:04:47.887 --> 01:04:49.917
Some of them are still intact and still resting on the shelf

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:54.107
in a very impressive display of placement,

01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:55.957
but some have fallen and cracked and shattered.

01:04:55.957 --> 01:05:00.247
And there's all sorts of odd dust and ash on the ground.

01:05:00.247 --> 01:05:01.517
TALIESIN: That earthquake buddy, man.

01:05:01.517 --> 01:05:02.350
MATT: Yeah.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.677
LIAM: I'm going to look more thoroughly

01:05:05.677 --> 01:05:07.907
and see if I can find anything very useful,

01:05:07.907 --> 01:05:10.137
like pearls or gold dust.

01:05:10.137 --> 01:05:12.454
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:13.687
(ice clinking against metal while in liquid
in ascending glissando)

01:05:13.687 --> 01:05:16.070
LAURA and SAM: (imitate ascending glissando)

01:05:17.312 --> 01:05:18.145
LIAM: 19.

01:05:18.145 --> 01:05:19.577
MATT: 19.

01:05:19.577 --> 01:05:24.577
You do find a pouch with seven white pearls in it.

01:05:24.582 --> 01:05:26.845
MARISHA: Ooh! Wow.

01:05:29.377 --> 01:05:30.210
LIAM: Yoink.

01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:32.620
MATT: But-- yeah.
TRAVIS: (heavy impact)

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:35.007
TALIESIN: (alarm blaring)

01:05:35.007 --> 01:05:36.582
MATT: A tiny crater inside Caleb.

01:05:38.347 --> 01:05:41.697
But that's the extent of what you find
that catches your eye as

01:05:41.697 --> 01:05:44.320
useful that you do not already have, or necessarily--

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.050
LIAM: I don't want to be here
a million years. That's amazing.

01:05:48.047 --> 01:05:49.137
I could stay here forever,

01:05:49.137 --> 01:05:50.937
but we should not stay here forever.

01:05:51.877 --> 01:05:54.627
SAM: Think we should check out the other room?

01:05:54.627 --> 01:05:55.460
LIAM: Yes.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.857
SAM: Okay. All right.

01:05:56.857 --> 01:05:59.507
Go back and tell the others what we found.

01:05:59.507 --> 01:06:00.427
TALIESIN: Interesting.

01:06:00.427 --> 01:06:02.997
LAURA: I'm tying off the rope so we can keep lowering down.

01:06:02.997 --> 01:06:03.830
SAM: Oh, good idea.

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:05.717
TALIESIN: Is there any writing

01:06:05.717 --> 01:06:06.997
in the main room where we're sitting?

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:08.220
Can we see anything on the wall

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.287
that looks like written language, or--?

01:06:10.287 --> 01:06:12.107
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:06:12.107 --> 01:06:14.807
SAM: I'll go check that other door for traps.

01:06:14.807 --> 01:06:15.827
TALIESIN: 25.

01:06:15.827 --> 01:06:17.687
MATT: 25, nice.

01:06:17.687 --> 01:06:20.989
From what you can tell, there isn't a lot

01:06:20.989 --> 01:06:25.187
of onset labeling anywhere, but you do see

01:06:25.187 --> 01:06:29.077
above the door that Veth was in, there is some text,

01:06:29.077 --> 01:06:32.177
and the other door has text above it as well.

01:06:32.177 --> 01:06:33.262
MATT: Charlie?

01:06:33.262 --> 01:06:34.911
VETH: Oh yeah.
MATT: "Yes?"

01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:36.677
TALIESIN: Can you read that in Common?

01:06:36.677 --> 01:06:39.047
Can you translate that into Common over there?

01:06:39.047 --> 01:06:43.267
MATT: "Oh, that is Component Keeping and Dry Storage.

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:46.864
"And this one is Records 104."

01:06:46.864 --> 01:06:47.972
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: (slap)

01:06:47.972 --> 01:06:49.317
(laughter)

01:06:49.317 --> 01:06:51.067
TALIESIN: I appreciate that.

01:06:51.067 --> 01:06:52.091
MATT: "Happy to help."

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:52.924
(electrical sparking)

01:06:52.924 --> 01:06:54.791
Sparks fly out of one half of his face.

01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:55.917
LAURA: Oh no!

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:57.790
TALIESIN: Can I get you anything? Are you all right?

01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:59.068
MATT: "I'm fine."
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

01:06:59.068 --> 01:07:01.297
MATT: "Hello."
TALIESIN: If you need anything, just ask.

01:07:01.297 --> 01:07:02.478
MATT: "Hello."
TALIESIN: Hello.

01:07:02.478 --> 01:07:03.311
MATT: "Hello."

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:05.154
TRAVIS: Oh no.
TALIESIN: Hi.

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:08.704
LIAM: I heard that, and I move closer to the

01:07:08.704 --> 01:07:11.537
rest of the group and keeping an eye

01:07:11.537 --> 01:07:14.037
on Caduceus and Charlie, actually go over to Essek.

01:07:15.017 --> 01:07:16.440
How are you on pearls?

01:07:18.347 --> 01:07:20.507
MATT: "I mean, I brought a number with myself,

01:07:20.507 --> 01:07:23.147
"but I will always accept more, why?"

01:07:23.147 --> 01:07:25.867
LIAM: I fish out three from the seven.

01:07:25.867 --> 01:07:27.097
Here, take these.

01:07:27.097 --> 01:07:27.930
MATT: "Thank you."

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:29.137
LIAM: They go fast.

01:07:29.137 --> 01:07:30.211
MATT: "True enough."

01:07:31.717 --> 01:07:32.647
LIAM: Records?

01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:35.777
TALIESIN: Records. Might be something.

01:07:35.777 --> 01:07:38.487
LAURA: Or should we keep chasing after, you know,

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:41.067
the guys that are about to blow us all up.

01:07:41.067 --> 01:07:42.447
LIAM: Is the door locked?

01:07:42.447 --> 01:07:44.284
SAM: The door's closed; I'm going to check it for traps.

01:07:44.284 --> 01:07:45.225
LIAM: Maybe they went through.

01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:46.757
MATT: Go ahead and check
SAM: Locks.

01:07:46.757 --> 01:07:48.173
LAURA: That's the room I saw!

01:07:48.173 --> 01:07:49.173
SAM: A million.

01:07:50.737 --> 01:07:51.747
MATT: The door is not trapped.

01:07:51.747 --> 01:07:52.947
SAM: 33. Yeah.

01:07:52.947 --> 01:07:54.707
MATT: It is not trapped.

01:07:54.707 --> 01:07:56.327
SAM: I'll open it.

01:07:56.327 --> 01:07:58.642
TALIESIN: Just taking a look inside. We're not going to--

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:00.109
TRAVIS: We'll leave the necropolis alone,

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.817
but the records.

01:08:01.817 --> 01:08:03.227
TALIESIN: Well, I mean--
MATT: (door creaking)

01:08:03.227 --> 01:08:04.368
SAM: A bunch of records?

01:08:04.368 --> 01:08:07.127
MATT: The door opens and it is a scattering

01:08:07.127 --> 01:08:12.127
of bound books and cases of paper.

01:08:13.597 --> 01:08:14.430
TRAVIS: Oh no.

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:18.530
MATT: All sorts of deep-glass vials of dark liquid.

01:08:19.697 --> 01:08:21.117
Stacks of blank papers.

01:08:21.117 --> 01:08:24.077
You immediately looking in here, this is

01:08:24.077 --> 01:08:28.987
a room that also keeps a bunch of blank vellum and ink.

01:08:28.987 --> 01:08:31.010
Everything you've ever searched for

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:33.457
in every shop you've ever been to.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:35.187
There is an--

01:08:35.187 --> 01:08:37.977
You can only fathom an unlimited supply in this large

01:08:37.977 --> 01:08:40.207
maybe 50 by 80 foot chamber.

01:08:40.207 --> 01:08:41.367
LIAM: Is there any rubble or anything

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.727
on the ground in this room as well?

01:08:43.727 --> 01:08:45.347
MATT: This room actually held pretty well.

01:08:45.347 --> 01:08:46.180
LIAM: Yeah?

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.670
MATT: There are a number of

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:52.957
tomes that are scattered about here,

01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:53.897
and you can see the push

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:55.997
of it that have texts and writing on them.

01:08:56.907 --> 01:09:01.327
LIAM: I-- I-- First thing I do, is bend down to--

01:09:01.327 --> 01:09:05.277
I find a blank piece of paper, and I tear a third

01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:09.067
of it away, and I write "records" on it,

01:09:09.067 --> 01:09:12.047
and I fold it up, and put it into my way point collection.

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:13.417
MATT: Okay.

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:15.737
TALIESIN: I would say let's just
get the Bag of Holding in there

01:09:15.737 --> 01:09:17.157
and just stuff some stuff

01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:18.527
and not look at what we're bringing.

01:09:18.527 --> 01:09:19.485
MARISHA: We don't have the bag.

01:09:19.485 --> 01:09:21.377
TALIESIN: We have like a tiny--
we don't have anything do we?

01:09:21.377 --> 01:09:24.545
LAURA: The haversack doesn't--
LIAM: I have the amber.

01:09:24.545 --> 01:09:28.607
Is there anything beyond? Is there any books of note?

01:09:28.607 --> 01:09:29.737
If I take five minutes?

01:09:29.737 --> 01:09:30.608
MATT: If you take five minutes,

01:09:30.608 --> 01:09:31.537
you want to make a quick investigation check,

01:09:31.537 --> 01:09:32.547
you can scan through.

01:09:32.547 --> 01:09:33.477
LIAM: Yes, I do.

01:09:33.477 --> 01:09:36.097
TALIESIN: Have a d4 on that.

01:09:36.097 --> 01:09:36.930
LIAM: Thank you.

01:09:39.027 --> 01:09:40.157
SAM: Book search!

01:09:41.007 --> 01:09:42.913
LIAM: An investigation?
MATT: Yep.

01:09:42.913 --> 01:09:44.007
LIAM: 28.

01:09:44.007 --> 01:09:46.657
MATT: Hoo.
TALIESIN: Worth it.

01:09:46.657 --> 01:09:51.497
MATT: You find a number of documents and pieces

01:09:51.497 --> 01:09:55.167
of paper that are written in the language of Aeor,

01:09:55.167 --> 01:09:57.027
but you cast--

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:58.157
LIAM: Comprehend Languages.

01:09:58.157 --> 01:09:59.947
MATT: So you have the ability to read them.

01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:01.097
To give you just a quick overview

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:02.297
in the five minutes of what you're

01:10:02.297 --> 01:10:03.687
just grab and peruse,

01:10:03.687 --> 01:10:05.597
because I'm not going to read a bunch of documents

01:10:05.597 --> 01:10:07.620
or make up a bunch of shit for you right now.

01:10:08.587 --> 01:10:12.267
There are some books that detail elements

01:10:12.267 --> 01:10:15.277
of the study of creation,

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.767
specifically creation of the Pantheon.

01:10:19.097 --> 01:10:22.927
Speaking of growing proof, from their perspective,

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:27.197
that mortal minds and imagination gave form to the gods,

01:10:27.197 --> 01:10:28.647
not the other way around.

01:10:30.707 --> 01:10:35.707
There is elements of research regarding that

01:10:35.957 --> 01:10:39.827
and debate and papers fighting for both perspectives

01:10:39.827 --> 01:10:41.710
throughout that one particular book.

01:10:43.417 --> 01:10:45.137
There is one note that catches your eye

01:10:45.137 --> 01:10:46.747
because the word, Somnovem,

01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:48.397
definitely is of interest to you.

01:10:49.517 --> 01:10:52.067
You find a report that speaks of the Somnovem

01:10:52.067 --> 01:10:55.607
having defied programs, breaking approved protocols

01:10:55.607 --> 01:10:57.257
and research and experimentation

01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:59.347
and hoarding their findings.

01:10:59.347 --> 01:11:02.277
And as such, studies have been
halted within the Cognouza Ward

01:11:02.277 --> 01:11:04.162
and members of the Somnovem collective

01:11:04.162 --> 01:11:06.217
are not to be allowed within the Genesis Ward,

01:11:06.217 --> 01:11:08.917
floors B-3 through B-6 until further notice.

01:11:08.917 --> 01:11:10.217
LIAM: B-3 and B-6.

01:11:10.217 --> 01:11:12.027
Through-- B-3 <i>through</i> B-6.

01:11:12.027 --> 01:11:13.487
MATT: Correct.

01:11:13.487 --> 01:11:17.037
You also see two more documents of note,

01:11:17.037 --> 01:11:19.187
and just quick, grab and read over.

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:20.027
LIAM: Yeah.

01:11:20.027 --> 01:11:23.031
MATT: One of them refers to the Factorum Malleus Project.

01:11:23.031 --> 01:11:24.222
LIAM: Factorum Mollis?

01:11:24.222 --> 01:11:26.307
MATT: Factorum Malleus Project,

01:11:26.307 --> 01:11:29.087
which translates loosely in the content to where

01:11:29.087 --> 01:11:31.159
you're interpreting as Hammer of Creation.

01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:32.460
LIAM and LAURA: Ooh!

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.797
MATT: It says that the project requires some time,

01:11:34.797 --> 01:11:37.357
but early results are satisfactory.

01:11:37.357 --> 01:11:38.757
And the last bit of note that you pick up.

01:11:38.757 --> 01:11:40.207
You went really high on this.

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:45.127
An individual named Athodan is referred to.

01:11:45.127 --> 01:11:47.467
Saying, "Athodan's work on rejuvenation

01:11:47.467 --> 01:11:49.270
"continues to show promise.

01:11:50.217 --> 01:11:52.707
"The relic is an inspiring find.

01:11:52.707 --> 01:11:54.735
"And the weaving of necromantic glyph work is

01:11:54.735 --> 01:11:57.427
"revealing unique arcane properties.

01:11:57.427 --> 01:11:59.617
"The magistri will be pleased this next round

01:11:59.617 --> 01:12:00.730
"of presentations."

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:03.026
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:12:04.384 --> 01:12:06.465
LIAM: Athodan, rejuvenation.

01:12:06.465 --> 01:12:08.090
(excited noises)

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:09.065
Oh, okay. I'm just

01:12:09.065 --> 01:12:10.267
going to gather all those up.

01:12:10.267 --> 01:12:11.100
MATT: Okay.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.857
LIAM: And I need 10 more minutes here.

01:12:13.857 --> 01:12:15.852
I know that we cannot stay and I sit down

01:12:15.852 --> 01:12:17.957
and I start making the circle of amber,

01:12:17.957 --> 01:12:20.440
so that I can take away a lot of paper.

01:12:22.467 --> 01:12:24.259
TALIESIN: What was the name of that? Of the?

01:12:24.259 --> 01:12:25.317
LAURA: 10 minutes, Caleb?

01:12:25.317 --> 01:12:26.150
LIAM: Yeah.

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:27.687
SAM: Maybe we can keep going.

01:12:27.687 --> 01:12:29.247
LAURA: Do you need the paper before we,

01:12:29.247 --> 01:12:31.027
you know, fight the world?

01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:31.883
LIAM: Why don't you--

01:12:31.883 --> 01:12:33.083
LAURA: Because you can always come back here.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:35.327
LIAM: Why don't you progress a little further?

01:12:35.327 --> 01:12:37.777
And I will just be-- I will just fly down to you?

01:12:39.097 --> 01:12:39.930
MARISHA: Brashaar.

01:12:41.637 --> 01:12:44.300
LIAM: No one has been here in thousands of years.

01:12:46.807 --> 01:12:48.237
10 minutes.

01:12:48.237 --> 01:12:49.500
LAURA: I know, but--.

01:12:50.997 --> 01:12:52.027
I'll lean over the side.

01:12:52.027 --> 01:12:55.120
Can I get a better look at the room that I had spotted?

01:12:56.377 --> 01:12:57.560
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:12:59.897 --> 01:13:01.937
LAURA: Can I get an assist? Ooh, Fjord.

01:13:01.937 --> 01:13:03.837
Yeah, can you like hold onto me,

01:13:03.837 --> 01:13:06.417
so I can look like lower down further?

01:13:06.417 --> 01:13:08.117
Hold on my ankles so I can drop.
TRAVIS: I have--

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:08.950
your ankles!?

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:12.158
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to hang off of the side by my ankles.

01:13:12.158 --> 01:13:14.408
So that I can get an advantage.
TRAVIS: I can totally do this.

01:13:14.408 --> 01:13:15.598
Beau, spot me!

01:13:15.598 --> 01:13:17.937
TALIESIN: That went from picturesque
to awkward very quickly.

01:13:17.937 --> 01:13:18.770
MATT: (laughs)

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.960
LAURA: Ooh yeah, oh, that's good, that's good.

01:13:22.417 --> 01:13:24.257
This is investigation or perception?

01:13:24.257 --> 01:13:25.090
MATT: Perception.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:26.857
LAURA: Okay, good.

01:13:26.857 --> 01:13:28.447
26!

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:29.360
MATT: Nice.

01:13:30.517 --> 01:13:34.347
Glancing down, from what you can see at the ledge below,

01:13:34.347 --> 01:13:36.847
there is just a faint bit of orange-ish, yellow light

01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:40.597
that is showing you the ragged edge

01:13:40.597 --> 01:13:43.657
that is visible from where the floor between kind

01:13:43.657 --> 01:13:45.207
of sheers off your perspective.

01:13:46.867 --> 01:13:50.457
But what you do see is the tile

01:13:50.457 --> 01:13:53.957
metallic-ish floor of it that is familiar, both

01:13:54.887 --> 01:13:58.537
the memory of what you Scryed upon

01:13:58.537 --> 01:14:02.140
as well as your previous experience in another Aeorian ruin.

01:14:03.317 --> 01:14:08.207
You also notice the beginning

01:14:08.207 --> 01:14:11.067
of what looks to be one of the numerous waterfalls

01:14:11.067 --> 01:14:14.217
about 15 feet to the right of it.

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:17.497
There is some sort of an aqueduct that has been sheered.

01:14:17.497 --> 01:14:20.007
And it's just giving out a trickle of water,

01:14:20.007 --> 01:14:22.610
a sound reminiscent to what you heard the night before.

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.855
LAURA: Help me up. Help me up!

01:14:25.855 --> 01:14:26.955
Fjord! Help me up!
TRAVIS: Huh? Oh.

01:14:26.955 --> 01:14:28.484
(grunt of exertion)

01:14:28.484 --> 01:14:30.120
LAURA: Okay, well, all right.

01:14:31.447 --> 01:14:33.064
That was it. It's the room. It's the room.

01:14:33.064 --> 01:14:35.687
It's definitely the room or at least it's the same floor.

01:14:35.687 --> 01:14:38.157
It's the same area that I saw them in.

01:14:38.157 --> 01:14:39.467
We need to go.

01:14:39.467 --> 01:14:42.143
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

01:14:43.257 --> 01:14:44.406
TRAVIS: We go.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:44.406 --> 01:14:45.389
SAM: Caleb, are you going to catch up?

01:14:45.389 --> 01:14:46.365
MARISHA: Are you going to catch up?

01:14:46.365 --> 01:14:49.027
LIAM: Yes. I'm going to.
ASHLEY: I can stay with Caleb.

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:49.917
SAM: Okay.

01:14:49.917 --> 01:14:51.167
TRAVIS: Why are you're staying with Caleb?

01:14:51.167 --> 01:14:52.227
ASHLEY: I don't want to leave him alone.

01:14:52.227 --> 01:14:53.460
TALIESIN: It's been a couple of minutes already.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.227
By the-- it'll take a few minutes for us to get down,

01:14:55.227 --> 01:14:57.002
and he'll just go last, I think it'll--.

01:14:57.002 --> 01:14:58.018
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:58.018 --> 01:15:00.377
TALIESIN: We can juggle this.

01:15:00.377 --> 01:15:04.447
MARISHA: Okay. Any good notebooks?

01:15:04.447 --> 01:15:05.280
Scoop them up.

01:15:06.287 --> 01:15:07.437
Paper and notebooks.

01:15:07.437 --> 01:15:08.287
LIAM: You know me.

01:15:08.287 --> 01:15:10.970
MARISHA: Okay. All right, let's go.

01:15:11.877 --> 01:15:14.020
LIAM: I wave with my eye.

01:15:15.997 --> 01:15:18.581
MARISHA: It's weird when I wave with the back of my hand.

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:20.070
LIAM: You don't have to do that, you could just do that.

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:21.427
TALIESIN: I don't like any of that.

01:15:21.427 --> 01:15:23.044
MATT: Essek, at which point, goes,

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:27.117
"You know, I'll stay as well, just to help keep watch."

01:15:27.117 --> 01:15:29.317
MARISHA: Okay. We are on a timetable, everybody.

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:32.307
I do want to, you know, timetable.

01:15:32.307 --> 01:15:33.177
ASHLEY: We'll go.

01:15:33.177 --> 01:15:34.010
TALIESIN: Let's go.

01:15:35.027 --> 01:15:36.677
TRAVIS: It's strange that these aqueducts are here.

01:15:36.677 --> 01:15:38.180
Was this area being cooled?

01:15:40.107 --> 01:15:42.289
They're not torn or natural.

01:15:42.289 --> 01:15:45.517
They looked like they were crafted.

01:15:45.517 --> 01:15:46.350
MATT: Okay.

01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:47.183
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:15:47.183 --> 01:15:50.270
TALIESIN: Maybe they were moving water to these rooms.

01:15:51.427 --> 01:15:52.397
TRAVIS: Okay, we go down.

01:15:52.397 --> 01:15:53.607
MATT: Everyone who is descending, go ahead

01:15:53.607 --> 01:15:57.157
and make an athletics check for me, please.

01:15:57.157 --> 01:15:58.907
TALIESIN: Boy.
MARISHA: Oh lord.

01:15:58.907 --> 01:16:00.442
SAM: (southern accent) Oh lord.

01:16:00.442 --> 01:16:01.617
MARISHA: Rolled a natural one.

01:16:01.617 --> 01:16:02.450
MATT: Oops.

01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:03.607
TRAVIS: Nine.

01:16:03.607 --> 01:16:04.857
LAURA: 21.

01:16:04.857 --> 01:16:06.477
SAM: 15.

01:16:06.477 --> 01:16:07.310
TALIESIN: 10.

01:16:08.216 --> 01:16:09.482
Athletics. 10.

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:10.465
MATT: Indeed.

01:16:13.047 --> 01:16:14.897
LAURA: I was at the bottom of the rope because I was first.

01:16:14.897 --> 01:16:16.217
MATT: Yes.

01:16:16.217 --> 01:16:18.767
The descent is a little more precarious this round.

01:16:20.167 --> 01:16:24.670
As you begin to make your way towards the next level,

01:16:26.197 --> 01:16:28.684
you can notice a faint bit of fraying beginning

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:31.387
to make itself known

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:32.857
towards the upper quarter

01:16:32.857 --> 01:16:34.807
of where the rope is currently affixed.

01:16:35.737 --> 01:16:37.287
As you make your way to the bottom of it,

01:16:37.287 --> 01:16:38.697
holding the rope, Jester,

01:16:38.697 --> 01:16:41.317
you glance up and see the rest of your friends descending,

01:16:41.317 --> 01:16:42.941
and you can hear that familiar.

01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:45.524
(creaking) (small snap)

01:16:47.053 --> 01:16:48.994
(creaking)

01:16:48.994 --> 01:16:50.148
LAURA: Climb faster.

01:16:52.947 --> 01:16:55.477
MATT: The rest of you make your way

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:58.357
to the platform where Jester is,

01:16:58.357 --> 01:17:00.290
but the rope is looking pretty rough.

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:03.397
LAURA: Is it-- That's our only rope?

01:17:03.397 --> 01:17:05.447
SAM: We have two ropes? Right?

01:17:05.447 --> 01:17:06.389
TALIESIN: I also got an idea.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:07.767
LAURA: Was that both ropes tied together?

01:17:07.767 --> 01:17:10.088
SAM: Should we mend it? Your Mending.
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can mend it.

01:17:10.088 --> 01:17:11.967
LAURA: I can mend it.
LIAM: You stayed? So you and Essek.

01:17:11.967 --> 01:17:13.744
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:15.294
LAURA: It just has to get down to me

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:17.287
because it's at the top.

01:17:18.137 --> 01:17:20.427
MATT: So you're now at the next ledge down,

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:22.637
about 30 feet below the place

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:26.242
where Yasha, Caleb, and Essek currently reside.

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:28.277
ASHLEY: I'll stand at the top where the other rope is

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.502
just waiting for Caleb and--

01:17:30.502 --> 01:17:31.602
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: -- Essek.

01:17:31.602 --> 01:17:33.837
MARISHA: And this is where they camped.

01:17:33.837 --> 01:17:35.717
LAURA: It's one more level down, potentially.

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:36.877
MARISHA: Oh, we don't know. Okay.

01:17:36.877 --> 01:17:38.347
MATT: But the level that you're at as you're standing there,

01:17:38.347 --> 01:17:40.767
you can see there is a floor

01:17:40.767 --> 01:17:42.287
across from you. You are--

01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:43.927
similar to the space above,

01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:46.737
there is another layer before you, but there is no light.

01:17:46.737 --> 01:17:48.319
TALIESIN: I'm going to light up my staff

01:17:48.319 --> 01:17:49.877
and take a look really quick.

01:17:51.037 --> 01:17:53.497
I'm going to take a look just peer down, though.

01:17:53.497 --> 01:17:54.330
I'm not going to walk in,

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:56.437
but light up the staff and peer down.

01:17:56.437 --> 01:17:57.777
MATT: Perception check.

01:17:57.777 --> 01:18:00.412
MARISHA: And it was like, they were banned from B-2 to B-6?

01:18:00.412 --> 01:18:02.417
TRAVIS and LAURA: B-3 to B-6.
TALIESIN: Ooh!

01:18:02.417 --> 01:18:03.250
27.

01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:04.083
LAURA: Ooh!

01:18:06.197 --> 01:18:08.077
MATT: Glancing through, the first thing that catches

01:18:08.077 --> 01:18:12.100
your eye is this area is destroyed.

01:18:13.337 --> 01:18:16.197
Similarly to the floor above, you can see furniture

01:18:16.197 --> 01:18:18.767
and installations and numerous, numerous bodies,

01:18:18.767 --> 01:18:23.247
but everything here is charred, blackened, and burned.

01:18:23.247 --> 01:18:24.607
Like something just tore

01:18:24.607 --> 01:18:27.950
through this floor and incinerated everything within.

01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:30.267
All the bodies are just blackened skeletons,

01:18:30.267 --> 01:18:33.397
their arms reaching out and then fallen in the ground

01:18:33.397 --> 01:18:36.797
charred to a pitch-onyx coloration,

01:18:36.797 --> 01:18:38.417
all the flesh just burned away

01:18:38.417 --> 01:18:41.347
to these flakes of ash and black.
SAM: ♪ Flakin' my way! ♪

01:18:41.347 --> 01:18:42.386
MARISHA: There it is.

01:18:42.386 --> 01:18:44.680
(laughter)

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.297
TALIESIN: Is there any visible words on anything and?

01:18:48.297 --> 01:18:50.517
MATT: Hard pressed with everything covered in soot.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:51.377
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:18:51.377 --> 01:18:53.047
MATT: You did roll a very high perception check.

01:18:53.047 --> 01:18:57.647
You do see a faint purple-ish glimmer

01:18:57.647 --> 01:18:59.575
a little deeper into the shadow

01:19:01.207 --> 01:19:02.320
near the ground.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.397
TALIESIN: I think I see something in there.

01:19:04.397 --> 01:19:06.225
SAM: Like a magic thing?
LAURA: Do you have darkvision?

01:19:06.225 --> 01:19:07.942
TALIESIN: I do not have darkvision. I have a light.

01:19:07.942 --> 01:19:10.357
LAURA: Can I see it better

01:19:10.357 --> 01:19:13.177
if he points at what he's looking at?

01:19:13.177 --> 01:19:16.197
MATT: It's probably about 40 or so feet in.

01:19:16.197 --> 01:19:17.947
So where you guys are standing, you can't quite--

01:19:17.947 --> 01:19:19.227
You're not quite sure what it is at this distance.

01:19:19.227 --> 01:19:21.837
The light helps fill the space around you,

01:19:21.837 --> 01:19:24.217
but the glimmer of purple that you see

01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:26.497
is just barely catching the light

01:19:26.497 --> 01:19:27.877
and is visible from here.

01:19:27.877 --> 01:19:29.327
LAURA: Can we hear anything on this level?

01:19:29.327 --> 01:19:30.528
Any movement, any--?

01:19:31.374 --> 01:19:33.541
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:19:35.183 --> 01:19:36.377
LAURA: Ow.

01:19:36.377 --> 01:19:39.237
They hurt me that time. The d4 attacked me.

01:19:39.237 --> 01:19:40.567
MATT: After all these years, they're finally learning

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:42.499
to rise up against you?
LAURA: I rolled really low, too.

01:19:44.077 --> 01:19:45.157
Nine.

01:19:45.157 --> 01:19:46.982
Nein!

01:19:48.527 --> 01:19:51.440
MATT: You don't hear anything moving. It's pretty still.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.262
It's just more the ominous appearance
of the space around you.

01:19:59.097 --> 01:20:00.964
TALIESIN: Who are we still missing? Caleb?

01:20:00.964 --> 01:20:02.482
LAURA and MARISHA: Essek and Yasha.

01:20:02.482 --> 01:20:03.917
TALIESIN: Essek and Yasha.

01:20:03.917 --> 01:20:06.087
MARISHA: I say we keep exploring what we want to explore

01:20:06.087 --> 01:20:07.517
so we can move.
SAM: What's this purple thing?

01:20:07.517 --> 01:20:08.862
MARISHA: Let's go.
TALIESIN: Do you mind?

01:20:08.862 --> 01:20:10.747
LAURA: Sneak over there, be careful.

01:20:10.747 --> 01:20:13.767
SAM: I will sneak and stealth over to the purple thing

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:14.937
that I can't see.

01:20:14.937 --> 01:20:16.822
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:20:16.822 --> 01:20:19.117
SAM: I have I have Caleb's thing still.

01:20:19.117 --> 01:20:20.617
I could use that.

01:20:20.617 --> 01:20:21.942
MARISHA: Yeah. Why not?

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:22.775
I don't know.

01:20:22.775 --> 01:20:23.766
SAM: <i>Tawhaj.</i>

01:20:24.697 --> 01:20:28.297
MATT: It gives off a dull, warm
glow in the space around you.

01:20:28.297 --> 01:20:29.337
SAM: Okay.

01:20:29.337 --> 01:20:31.187
I will sneak over and look.

01:20:31.187 --> 01:20:32.422
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.

01:20:32.422 --> 01:20:37.274
SAM: Stealth? Okay, stealth is 24.

01:20:37.274 --> 01:20:39.077
MATT: Okay, so you're making no noise

01:20:39.077 --> 01:20:40.077
as far as you're concerned.

01:20:40.077 --> 01:20:43.461
Though hard to hide when you're clutching a glowing orb.

01:20:43.461 --> 01:20:45.135
SAM: 26.
MATT: 26.

01:20:45.135 --> 01:20:46.777
TALIESIN: Throw a cloth over it.

01:20:46.777 --> 01:20:47.827
MATT: Well, that's up to him to say.

01:20:47.827 --> 01:20:49.827
SAM: Nope.
MATT: Or her. I'm sorry.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:52.677
TRAVIS: Got to get to the purple thing.

01:20:52.677 --> 01:20:53.997
MATT: But glancing around

01:20:53.997 --> 01:20:58.197
and utilizing Caduceus' pointing out.

01:20:58.197 --> 01:21:00.827
You find that one of the charred corpses.

01:21:00.827 --> 01:21:02.727
You see it on the ground on its back,

01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:06.157
arms out. There is an electrum bracelet

01:21:06.157 --> 01:21:08.597
around its wrist that is mostly covered in soot.

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:09.430
SAM: Electrum?

01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:13.077
MATT: Electrum, like a silver-ish metallic coloration.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.477
And in the center of the band,

01:21:14.477 --> 01:21:16.847
there is an amethyst-like gem.

01:21:16.847 --> 01:21:18.572
SAM: That's glowing.

01:21:18.572 --> 01:21:20.167
MATT: No, it just has a purplish color to it.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:22.322
SAM: Oh, it's like just a glimmer?
LAURA: Catching the light a little bit?

01:21:22.322 --> 01:21:23.504
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Oh, got it.

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:24.337
MARISHA: Get it!

01:21:24.337 --> 01:21:26.187
SAM: Yeah, of course, yeah.
LIAM: Nintendo Power Glove!

01:21:26.187 --> 01:21:28.267
SAM: I take the thing off of the body.

01:21:28.267 --> 01:21:31.597
MATT: The wrist just breaks into ash

01:21:31.597 --> 01:21:33.277
and it just falls apart around it.

01:21:33.277 --> 01:21:35.418
So you have the dirty wristband.

01:21:35.418 --> 01:21:36.918
TRAVIS and SAM: Sorry.

01:21:37.887 --> 01:21:39.637
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Any other doors?

01:21:39.637 --> 01:21:41.886
Anything else that's-- points of interest

01:21:41.886 --> 01:21:43.569
to investigate or are we--?

01:21:43.569 --> 01:21:47.410
MATT: There are multiple halls that exit from this floor.

01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:48.547
Three in particular:

01:21:48.547 --> 01:21:51.067
one across and then one to the right and left.

01:21:51.067 --> 01:21:52.667
LAURA: Are there any words on the walls?

01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:54.575
Anything like that?
MARISHA: Yeah. Charlie.

01:21:54.575 --> 01:21:56.647
LAURA: Charlie, can you read anything in here?

01:21:56.647 --> 01:21:59.347
MATT: "Everything here is fairly dirty."

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:01.267
LAURA: Yeah, but are there any words that you can read?

01:22:01.267 --> 01:22:04.707
MARISHA: I just run by all the hallway entrances

01:22:04.707 --> 01:22:07.351
and just dust them off really quick.

01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:09.747
LAURA: Quietly, very quietly.

01:22:09.747 --> 01:22:11.459
SAM: A quick, quiet dusting.

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:13.519
(laughter)

01:22:13.519 --> 01:22:14.695
LIAM: Monk shit.

01:22:14.695 --> 01:22:15.671
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:22:15.671 --> 01:22:17.446
50 feet.
TALIESIN: Grab the bracelet really quickly.

01:22:17.446 --> 01:22:18.757
(laughter)

01:22:18.757 --> 01:22:20.340
TALIESIN: Charlie, do you know what this is?

01:22:21.807 --> 01:22:23.698
MATT: "I...

01:22:23.698 --> 01:22:24.781
"don't."

01:22:26.347 --> 01:22:27.604
TALIESIN: Insight check.

01:22:27.604 --> 01:22:28.607
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:22:28.607 --> 01:22:29.748
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:22:34.237 --> 01:22:36.367
SAM: You're trying to read an expressionless robot?

01:22:36.367 --> 01:22:38.600
TALIESIN: That was a little weird. 28.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.497
MATT: (laughs)

01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:41.477
TALIESIN: There was something-- I don't know

01:22:41.477 --> 01:22:43.937
if I just saw something, like, actually running

01:22:43.937 --> 01:22:45.190
through there or not.

01:22:46.507 --> 01:22:51.507
MATT: You've not spent time reading synthetic creatures,

01:22:53.467 --> 01:22:55.957
but you still have a fairly good read

01:22:55.957 --> 01:22:59.960
on pauses and language and withholding information.

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:03.717
Charlie seems genuinely perplexed.

01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:04.742
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:23:05.933 --> 01:23:06.766
Okay.

01:23:08.537 --> 01:23:11.206
MARISHA: Did I find anything in my quick dusting?

01:23:11.206 --> 01:23:12.640
TALIESIN: We need to know what this is, I have--

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.581
MATT: Yes, you see there are bits of language

01:23:15.581 --> 01:23:17.247
in some of the hallways.

01:23:17.247 --> 01:23:18.972
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Though it is smudged.

01:23:18.972 --> 01:23:20.727
MARISHA: Charlie, Charlie.

01:23:20.727 --> 01:23:23.153
LAURA: I'll creep over so Charlie can read things.

01:23:23.153 --> 01:23:23.986
MARISHA: Charlie.

01:23:25.339 --> 01:23:26.931
LAURA: Like, use my shoulder as a flashlight?

01:23:26.931 --> 01:23:27.950
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:30.603
MARISHA: What's this?

01:23:30.603 --> 01:23:33.207
MATT: "Elemental Energy Funneling."

01:23:33.207 --> 01:23:35.817
MARISHA: Elemental Energy Funneling.

01:23:35.817 --> 01:23:36.787
TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: Okay.

01:23:36.787 --> 01:23:38.045
MARISHA: What's this one?

01:23:39.157 --> 01:23:40.717
MATT: "That's reads the same."

01:23:40.717 --> 01:23:41.550
LAURA: Oh.

01:23:43.747 --> 01:23:45.272
MARISHA: That could be your--

01:23:45.272 --> 01:23:46.938
and then this one?

01:23:48.187 --> 01:23:51.437
MATT: The other hallway does not have a label.

01:23:51.437 --> 01:23:53.291
MARISHA: Oh, okay.
SAM: It's a break room.

01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:54.249
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:23:54.249 --> 01:23:56.637
LAURA: I say we continue down.
MARISHA: I agree.

01:23:56.637 --> 01:23:58.127
TALIESIN: Let's collect our people.

01:23:58.127 --> 01:23:59.597
MARISHA: Caleb.

01:23:59.597 --> 01:24:02.207
SAM: I'll send a message upstairs.

01:24:02.207 --> 01:24:05.077
Caleb, any progress? You almost done?

01:24:05.077 --> 01:24:06.387
You can reply to this message.

01:24:06.387 --> 01:24:07.757
LIAM: That was a good chunk of time, right?

01:24:07.757 --> 01:24:09.500
I'm just wrapping up.

01:24:10.527 --> 01:24:12.009
MATT: So as you were in there

01:24:12.009 --> 01:24:14.027
collecting and preparing the spell,

01:24:14.027 --> 01:24:16.777
Essek's leaning against the wall, arms crossed.

01:24:20.734 --> 01:24:21.900
MATT: "So--"

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:22.733
SAM: Oh.

01:24:25.944 --> 01:24:28.992
MATT: "What is everyone's hope through this?"

01:24:29.894 --> 01:24:33.199
LIAM: Well-- As I'm putting down stacks of Dunder Mifflin

01:24:34.034 --> 01:24:35.094
like it's a pallet,

01:24:35.094 --> 01:24:38.324
and then also grabbing books that I did not even inspect

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:42.114
and plopping them down in for inspection later.

01:24:42.114 --> 01:24:42.964
What do you mean in this room,

01:24:42.964 --> 01:24:44.314
or do you mean down below?

01:24:45.184 --> 01:24:46.017
MATT: "Down below."

01:24:46.017 --> 01:24:49.142
LAURA: Six feet under the ground below.

01:24:51.804 --> 01:24:53.314
MATT: "I just have a general sense of unease.

01:24:53.314 --> 01:24:54.914
"I did not sleep well last night.

01:24:58.054 --> 01:24:59.784
"The more I begin to see

01:25:00.754 --> 01:25:02.564
"Beauregard, yourself

01:25:06.114 --> 01:25:08.847
"return with these markings--

01:25:12.824 --> 01:25:14.214
"I've only just recently learned to trust.

01:25:14.214 --> 01:25:16.774
"It's hard to begin to mistrust so quickly.

01:25:16.774 --> 01:25:19.284
"So I just need your assurance

01:25:20.419 --> 01:25:21.919
"that you will be forthright

01:25:21.919 --> 01:25:23.944
"should anything begin to change."

01:25:25.534 --> 01:25:27.594
LIAM: Well, here's the thing--

01:25:28.664 --> 01:25:29.989
stack, stack.

01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:33.476
I cannot guarantee you

01:25:37.244 --> 01:25:40.760
I know what these do,

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.937
or that I can handle what they might bring.

01:25:46.234 --> 01:25:47.429
But my friends down below

01:25:47.429 --> 01:25:51.400
will make sure that there is no harm come of it.

01:25:56.504 --> 01:25:58.167
I'm not going into this blind.

01:26:06.163 --> 01:26:08.067
Essek, it is worth the risk.

01:26:09.454 --> 01:26:11.284
If whatever is down there

01:26:13.644 --> 01:26:14.664
returns,

01:26:16.084 --> 01:26:17.414
your home, my home

01:26:20.314 --> 01:26:21.709
is in question, so.

01:26:23.401 --> 01:26:24.499
MATT: "Let me ask you this."

01:26:24.499 --> 01:26:25.332
LIAM: Hmm?

01:26:26.998 --> 01:26:29.864
MATT: "You carry this worry and weight

01:26:29.864 --> 01:26:33.187
"that Master Ikithon gives chase as well, yes?"

01:26:35.614 --> 01:26:37.154
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:26:37.154 --> 01:26:38.754
MATT: "Which is more important to you,

01:26:40.484 --> 01:26:42.227
"that chase or this one?"

01:26:44.084 --> 01:26:44.917
LIAM: This one.

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:47.617
MATT: "Good."

01:26:49.184 --> 01:26:50.284
LIAM: If we don't take care of this,

01:26:50.284 --> 01:26:51.634
we can't take care of that.

01:26:53.324 --> 01:26:54.264
I have

01:26:55.874 --> 01:26:59.554
a great many desires for my home.

01:27:02.354 --> 01:27:06.224
But they are on the back burner, as they say.

01:27:06.224 --> 01:27:08.234
MATT: "I understand.

01:27:08.234 --> 01:27:09.824
"I only ask because I've seen

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:12.614
"a great many prospective talents like yours

01:27:15.174 --> 01:27:16.974
"grow unfocused

01:27:16.974 --> 01:27:18.384
"in times of

01:27:19.424 --> 01:27:22.417
"necessity and decisive action."

01:27:30.064 --> 01:27:32.254
LIAM: You're not curious about what's around you right now?

01:27:32.254 --> 01:27:33.662
MATT: "I'm extremely curious.

01:27:33.662 --> 01:27:35.228
"I'm taking in everything I can.

01:27:35.228 --> 01:27:36.974
"But I also understand that

01:27:37.894 --> 01:27:40.024
"if one is to keep their nose in a tome,

01:27:40.024 --> 01:27:42.174
"somebody else needs to be paying attention.

01:27:44.064 --> 01:27:46.844
"I've also been around a lot longer than you have.

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:48.664
"I know how to curb these curiosities

01:27:48.664 --> 01:27:51.567
"for the sake of what's directly ahead.

01:27:53.224 --> 01:27:54.707
"I can sense a similar discomfort

01:27:54.707 --> 01:27:56.234
"in some of your compatriots."

01:27:56.234 --> 01:27:57.067
LIAM: Yes.

01:27:58.384 --> 01:27:59.534
MATT: "Some things can wait.

01:28:00.634 --> 01:28:02.754
"We've only touched the beginning of this,

01:28:02.754 --> 01:28:05.554
"I can only assume that there is going to be many more...

01:28:07.424 --> 01:28:09.484
"intriguing mysteries played before us,

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:13.587
"but they are not what our goal is.

01:28:14.514 --> 01:28:16.064
"If we survive all of this, then

01:28:17.234 --> 01:28:19.454
"we will return, make a trip of it.

01:28:19.454 --> 01:28:20.287
"But--

01:28:23.194 --> 01:28:24.027
"I just worry."

01:28:24.944 --> 01:28:25.777
ASHLEY: Psst.

01:28:26.694 --> 01:28:29.684
Hey, this place is creeping me the fuck out, too.

01:28:29.684 --> 01:28:30.724
I don't know if you remember

01:28:30.724 --> 01:28:31.994
that we split up with our party,

01:28:31.994 --> 01:28:33.664
but we should probably go.

01:28:33.664 --> 01:28:34.497
LIAM: Wrapping up.

01:28:34.497 --> 01:28:35.664
MATT: "You heard the woman.

01:28:40.092 --> 01:28:40.925
"Thank you, Yasha."

01:28:40.925 --> 01:28:42.024
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

01:28:42.024 --> 01:28:43.024
I'll hold the rope.

01:28:43.024 --> 01:28:44.894
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Please.

01:28:44.894 --> 01:28:46.744
TALIESIN: We should hold the rope from the other end, too,

01:28:46.744 --> 01:28:48.134
since this is the iffy rope.

01:28:48.134 --> 01:28:50.107
LAURA: Oh yeah. Yasha's got it, but

01:28:51.684 --> 01:28:55.234
yeah, I'll hold the other end just in casies.

01:28:55.234 --> 01:28:57.733
Also, Fjord, hold onto my waist.

01:28:57.733 --> 01:28:58.566
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:28:58.566 --> 01:28:59.632
LAURA: Plant your feet.

01:28:59.632 --> 01:29:01.564
If somebody goes flying down

01:29:01.564 --> 01:29:03.257
it's going to give us a lot of force.

01:29:03.257 --> 01:29:04.090
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:05.417
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: That's picturesque.

01:29:05.417 --> 01:29:07.127
LAURA: Hold a little tighter.

01:29:09.204 --> 01:29:11.056
MATT: As you hold the rope,

01:29:11.056 --> 01:29:13.214
Essek gingerly places a hand on it

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:15.147
and just Mary Poppins down.

01:29:15.147 --> 01:29:16.892
ASHLEY: Well, showoff.
TALIESIN: Aww.

01:29:16.892 --> 01:29:18.154
MATT: To the next bit.

01:29:18.154 --> 01:29:19.544
MARISHA: I'm Mary Poppins, y'all.

01:29:19.544 --> 01:29:21.260
MATT: Yep.
TALIESIN: I was thinking it.

01:29:22.594 --> 01:29:23.934
LIAM: And there was no warning or anything

01:29:23.934 --> 01:29:25.834
made about this fraying rope, right?

01:29:25.834 --> 01:29:26.950
MATT: No.
LAURA: Oh!

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:29.124
LIAM: I'll go down first, I start climbing down.

01:29:29.124 --> 01:29:31.177
MATT: All right, make an athletics check for me, please.

01:29:33.381 --> 01:29:34.389
LIAM: Five.

01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:38.204
MATT: You get about six feet down

01:29:38.204 --> 01:29:40.854
before the rope (tearing)

01:29:40.854 --> 01:29:42.784
You glance up and see it

01:29:42.784 --> 01:29:45.584
tearing its final thread before (snapping)

01:29:45.584 --> 01:29:48.027
it goes free and you go into free fall.

01:29:48.027 --> 01:29:49.454
LAURA: I've got the other end.

01:29:49.454 --> 01:29:50.737
MATT: You do.
LAURA: Does he go past us?

01:29:50.737 --> 01:29:52.253
MATT: Yasha, you--
TRAVIS: You smell really good-- whoa!

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:54.954
MATT: -- almost fall into your back as the rope goes free.

01:29:54.954 --> 01:29:58.104
You watch as Caleb tumbles down towards the group

01:29:58.104 --> 01:30:01.291
a little ways free of you and just goes off the edge.

01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:02.124
MARISHA: Oh, there he goes.

01:30:02.124 --> 01:30:03.754
LAURA: He's not holding onto the rope at all anymore?

01:30:03.754 --> 01:30:05.174
MATT: We're going to find out in a second.

01:30:05.174 --> 01:30:07.204
Make a strength saving throw for me, Caleb.

01:30:07.204 --> 01:30:08.647
LIAM: Holding onto the rope?
MATT: Correct.

01:30:08.647 --> 01:30:10.194
LIAM: Or I could turn into a sparrow.

01:30:10.194 --> 01:30:11.314
MATT: Also, that too.

01:30:11.314 --> 01:30:13.504
Well, there you go, never mind.

01:30:13.504 --> 01:30:15.354
As he darts and falls off the side,

01:30:15.354 --> 01:30:18.840
as you clutch onto the rope, (whoosh),

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.164
he turns into a bird and curves his way

01:30:21.164 --> 01:30:23.231
back towards the ledge.
MARISHA: Oh look, you've got a kite.

01:30:24.564 --> 01:30:26.394
LIAM: I lose the rope.

01:30:26.394 --> 01:30:27.804
I land on Jester's shoulder.

01:30:27.804 --> 01:30:29.944
I'm just going to peck, peck, peck.

01:30:29.944 --> 01:30:31.854
LAURA: Ow, ow, ow, I'm sorry!
LIAM: It's not hard.

01:30:31.854 --> 01:30:33.631
LAURA: I thought--
LIAM: It's not hard.

01:30:33.631 --> 01:30:35.184
TALIESIN: Yasha, do need help getting down?

01:30:35.184 --> 01:30:36.474
ASHLEY: No, you guys go on without me,

01:30:36.474 --> 01:30:38.094
I'm just going to stay.

01:30:38.094 --> 01:30:40.494
(laughter)

01:30:40.494 --> 01:30:42.634
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: She loves records!

01:30:42.634 --> 01:30:44.424
MARISHA: Jump, I'll catch you.

01:30:44.424 --> 01:30:45.264
TALIESIN: It's all vinyl.

01:30:45.264 --> 01:30:47.074
ASHLEY: Is it-- how far d--

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:49.154
It's far. I wouldn't be able to climb?

01:30:49.154 --> 01:30:50.304
MATT: It's about 30 feet down.

01:30:50.304 --> 01:30:52.344
You could try and climb down the rubble.

01:30:52.344 --> 01:30:54.184
It's a higher DC, but you can certainly try.

01:30:54.184 --> 01:30:55.524
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll try to climb down the rubble.

01:30:55.524 --> 01:30:56.357
MATT: Okay.

01:30:56.357 --> 01:30:57.190
ASHLEY: Because I have other things I can do.

01:30:57.190 --> 01:30:58.856
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check for me.

01:30:58.856 --> 01:31:00.399
SAM: I'm going to come over and watch.

01:31:00.399 --> 01:31:01.882
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:01.882 --> 01:31:04.638
ASHLEY: Oh, that is a natural one.

01:31:04.638 --> 01:31:06.392
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh no.

01:31:06.392 --> 01:31:08.711
ASHLEY: That's okay, that's okay, I have other options.

01:31:08.711 --> 01:31:10.607
MARISHA: That rock is loose, that rock is loose!

01:31:12.394 --> 01:31:14.534
MATT: You just begin to descend,

01:31:14.534 --> 01:31:15.944
and you're grabbing at some sections of it.

01:31:15.944 --> 01:31:17.369
You're like, "Okay, I can do this."

01:31:17.369 --> 01:31:18.569
ASHLEY: I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:31:18.569 --> 01:31:20.054
I got it, everybody.

01:31:20.054 --> 01:31:21.754
MATT: And as soon as you reach your foot down,

01:31:21.754 --> 01:31:23.509
you catch a ledge and you put your weight on it,

01:31:23.509 --> 01:31:24.664
and it just crumbles.

01:31:24.664 --> 01:31:25.814
And as it crumbles you hold on tightly,

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:28.857
and both of these come free and you're now in a free fall.

01:31:28.857 --> 01:31:29.891
MARISHA: Oh, there she goes.

01:31:29.891 --> 01:31:31.333
SAM: I'll take out my feather,

01:31:31.333 --> 01:31:34.384
but I'm waiting a second to see if you do anything.

01:31:34.384 --> 01:31:35.484
MATT: You are free falling

01:31:36.514 --> 01:31:38.934
20 feet. Ten feet.
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll use it. (whoosh)

01:31:38.934 --> 01:31:40.434
Bamf out wings.

01:31:40.434 --> 01:31:41.267
MATT: All right.

01:31:43.424 --> 01:31:44.599
Much cooler than the sparrow.

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:46.534
TRAVIS: (angelic vocalizing)
MATT: As cool as that was.

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:48.244
The angelic Yasha coasts.

01:31:48.244 --> 01:31:49.164
LIAM: I'm adorable.

01:31:49.164 --> 01:31:50.014
MATT: You are adorable.

01:31:50.014 --> 01:31:51.318
You are more adorable then her.

01:31:51.318 --> 01:31:52.359
ASHLEY: You are, that's true.

01:31:52.359 --> 01:31:55.174
LAURA: Yasha, can you fly all of us down to the next level?

01:31:55.174 --> 01:31:56.049
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:31:56.049 --> 01:31:57.884
TALIESIN: That'd be great.
SAM: How long does it last?

01:31:57.884 --> 01:31:58.717
MARISHA: One minute.

01:31:58.717 --> 01:32:00.254
SAM: Let's go, let's fucking go!

01:32:00.254 --> 01:32:01.134
One at a time.

01:32:01.134 --> 01:32:02.259
MARISHA: I just jump on her.

01:32:02.259 --> 01:32:03.158
ASHLEY: Come here, baby.

01:32:03.158 --> 01:32:04.551
Who else, who else?
LAURA: Ooh, ooh!

01:32:04.551 --> 01:32:05.634
ASHLEY: Come on, come on.

01:32:05.634 --> 01:32:07.348
TALIESIN: I'll wait.

01:32:07.348 --> 01:32:09.598
ASHLEY: I'll take two at a time.

01:32:09.598 --> 01:32:11.184
MATT: With the minute that you have,

01:32:11.184 --> 01:32:13.694
you quickly begin ferrying the group one-by-one

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:14.867
to the next floor.

01:32:15.924 --> 01:32:19.218
MATT: This would be B-3, I believe.

01:32:19.218 --> 01:32:21.061
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Bingo.

01:32:21.061 --> 01:32:22.474
TALIESIN: Off-limits.

01:32:22.474 --> 01:32:23.307
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:32:27.094 --> 01:32:28.307
LAURA: This is the orange room.

01:32:28.307 --> 01:32:31.064
TALIESIN: Before we go in, I have a question for Essek.

01:32:31.064 --> 01:32:31.897
MATT: "Yes?"

01:32:31.897 --> 01:32:32.954
TALIESIN: Can you Identify this?

01:32:32.954 --> 01:32:35.817
I have a funny feeling this might be important.

01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:40.034
At least as important as the robe.

01:32:40.034 --> 01:32:41.561
MATT: What are you handing him?

01:32:41.561 --> 01:32:42.394
ALL: The bracelet.

01:32:42.394 --> 01:32:44.524
MATT: Oh, the bracelet, got you.

01:32:44.524 --> 01:32:45.635
TRAVIS: "What are you handing him?" (laughs)

01:32:45.635 --> 01:32:48.224
TALIESIN: Don't you see miming holding a thing?

01:32:48.224 --> 01:32:49.991
SAM: Can't you see it, Matt?

01:32:49.991 --> 01:32:52.007
MATT: "I will take some bacon, thank you."

01:32:52.007 --> 01:32:53.040
TALIESIN: Bangarang.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.687
(laughter)

01:32:54.687 --> 01:32:56.067
TALIESIN: He's starting to believe.

01:32:58.564 --> 01:32:59.664
MATT: He takes it and you watch as

01:32:59.664 --> 01:33:01.604
his eyes flash over it for a second.

01:33:01.604 --> 01:33:05.854
He goes, "There's some sort of

01:33:05.854 --> 01:33:10.157
"faint magical aura to it. Evocation.

01:33:12.214 --> 01:33:14.631
"It seems to be utilized as some sort of a key."

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.974
SAM: We needed a key for something.

01:33:17.974 --> 01:33:18.807
TRAVIS: Yeah, the tower.

01:33:18.807 --> 01:33:20.693
TALIESIN: We're going to need keys.
TRAVIS: The lightning tower.

01:33:20.693 --> 01:33:21.978
SAM: Oh.

01:33:21.978 --> 01:33:23.164
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.504
MATT: He hands it back to you.

01:33:24.504 --> 01:33:26.578
LIAM: The sparrow lands on Fjord's bald head,

01:33:26.578 --> 01:33:30.419
and you feel the little tiny claws going (scritching)

01:33:30.419 --> 01:33:31.914
in your skin.

01:33:31.914 --> 01:33:33.874
TRAVIS: See, there's traction, you could have tried,

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:35.209
you could have held on.

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:37.034
SAM: I was reaching for the hair.

01:33:37.034 --> 01:33:39.027
TALIESIN: I'm going to wear this for now.

01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:40.774
MATT: "Very well."

01:33:40.774 --> 01:33:42.424
TALIESIN: Unless you would want to wear it.

01:33:44.114 --> 01:33:45.789
MATT: "You go ahead."

01:33:47.406 --> 01:33:49.001
LAURA: It goes with your outfit.
TALIESIN: It does, actually.

01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:50.151
LAURA: It has an amethyst.
TALIESIN: I feel like it really blends.

01:33:50.151 --> 01:33:50.984
LAURA: Yeah, I like it.

01:33:50.984 --> 01:33:52.464
MATT: "It's quite striking, you're not wrong."

01:33:52.464 --> 01:33:55.254
MARISHA: So we're on B-3 now?

01:33:56.174 --> 01:33:57.664
LAURA: In the room that we saw, that I saw?

01:33:57.664 --> 01:33:59.064
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Indeed.

01:33:59.064 --> 01:34:01.684
The first thing you notice is once you all land

01:34:01.684 --> 01:34:04.834
you can definitely hear the running of water.

01:34:04.834 --> 01:34:06.534
And about 15 feet off to the right

01:34:06.534 --> 01:34:08.674
you can see the trickle of water

01:34:08.674 --> 01:34:10.294
that is splashing down and

01:34:10.294 --> 01:34:12.114
vanishing into the shadow below.

01:34:12.114 --> 01:34:14.719
And the multitude of floors that will continue downward,

01:34:14.719 --> 01:34:16.715
deeper, deeper into this cavern.

01:34:17.894 --> 01:34:20.044
Now this floor, the space where you are,

01:34:20.044 --> 01:34:21.684
a little ways off you can see

01:34:21.684 --> 01:34:23.914
a darkened circle on the ground

01:34:23.914 --> 01:34:26.789
and the remnants of a slight fire.

01:34:26.789 --> 01:34:28.564
LAURA: This is where they were.

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:31.524
Now the aesthetic in this entire space

01:34:31.524 --> 01:34:33.584
as the hall continues backward,

01:34:33.584 --> 01:34:34.561
you can see this.

01:34:34.561 --> 01:34:36.214
You're at the edge of a hall, by the way.

01:34:36.214 --> 01:34:41.214
There was a tunnel, a ten, 15-foot wide hallway

01:34:41.674 --> 01:34:43.876
that you are currently standing at the edge of.

01:34:43.876 --> 01:34:45.364
And that has been bisected at this point.

01:34:45.364 --> 01:34:46.854
It continues inward.

01:34:46.854 --> 01:34:50.404
You can see gently flickering on and off

01:34:50.404 --> 01:34:52.674
in a randomized pattern, as if

01:34:52.674 --> 01:34:56.574
the arcane enchantment is slowly sputtering over time.

01:34:56.574 --> 01:34:58.724
The orangish-yellow source light

01:34:58.724 --> 01:35:00.064
that is in the nearby ceiling.

01:35:00.064 --> 01:35:02.997
And you can see numerous ones deeper within the hall.

01:35:04.054 --> 01:35:07.284
The aesthetic in here is

01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:10.994
a familiar design, that dark metallic

01:35:10.994 --> 01:35:14.593
that you previously had encountered in the laboratory in

01:35:14.593 --> 01:35:16.060
I believe it was A2.

01:35:17.826 --> 01:35:19.954
Consistent structure, design, layout

01:35:19.954 --> 01:35:21.174
as to that same space.

01:35:21.174 --> 01:35:23.787
You can see the archways are familiar.

01:35:23.787 --> 01:35:25.184
Also, the hall when you first arrived here,

01:35:25.184 --> 01:35:26.434
that's the upward.

01:35:26.434 --> 01:35:29.914
You can see fallen cables and areas of exposed wall

01:35:29.914 --> 01:35:33.734
that seem to have some sort of metallic inlay

01:35:33.734 --> 01:35:38.097
that has a sigilic design to it.

01:35:39.564 --> 01:35:42.324
There are channels for magic

01:35:42.324 --> 01:35:45.894
to be funneled from one location to the next.

01:35:45.894 --> 01:35:47.554
MARISHA: Okay, that makes sense.

01:35:47.554 --> 01:35:48.995
LAURA: You guys,

01:35:48.995 --> 01:35:50.928
there could be another creepy baby monster here.

01:35:50.928 --> 01:35:52.369
MARISHA: Absolutely, this feels like some sort of--

01:35:52.369 --> 01:35:55.174
TALIESIN: Feels very creepy baby monster.
MARISHA: -- weird factory,

01:35:55.174 --> 01:35:58.204
especially with the upstairs being the

01:35:59.134 --> 01:36:01.344
elemental energy funneling.

01:36:01.344 --> 01:36:03.644
And these aqueducts that you mention,

01:36:03.644 --> 01:36:05.944
it feels like it's all pumping into some sort of weird--

01:36:05.944 --> 01:36:07.324
SAM: Lucien just spent the night here,

01:36:07.324 --> 01:36:10.552
so it can't be that dangerous, right?

01:36:10.552 --> 01:36:13.471
MARISHA: I mean, this kind of
feels like his aesthetic, right?

01:36:13.471 --> 01:36:15.154
TRAVIS: Any blood on the floor, around the campfire,

01:36:15.154 --> 01:36:16.044
anything like that?

01:36:16.044 --> 01:36:18.461
MATT: Make an investigation check.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:36:19.872 --> 01:36:21.372
TRAVIS: Oh, 26.

01:36:22.431 --> 01:36:24.024
LAURA: Fingernail clippings.

01:36:24.024 --> 01:36:29.024
MATT: You actually see a gentle spray on the floor

01:36:29.034 --> 01:36:30.461
partway into the tunnel

01:36:32.244 --> 01:36:35.974
TRAVIS: Partway into the tunnel that's in the distance?

01:36:35.974 --> 01:36:37.647
MATT: You guys are at the mouth of the tunnel.

01:36:37.647 --> 01:36:39.424
After the ledge where you are is where there was a tunnel

01:36:39.424 --> 01:36:40.897
that was sheared off when the explosion hit.

01:36:40.897 --> 01:36:42.534
But the tunnel goes deeper into the wall,

01:36:42.534 --> 01:36:46.537
or deeper into the the main side of this giant cavern.

01:36:48.224 --> 01:36:49.057
TRAVIS: Just guessing,

01:36:49.057 --> 01:36:53.434
it looks like they've used some of the blood magic to--

01:36:53.434 --> 01:36:54.804
MATT: With that level of investigation,

01:36:54.804 --> 01:36:56.714
you very much can see this was intentional.

01:36:56.714 --> 01:36:58.394
It's not small enough to be anything life-threatening,

01:36:58.394 --> 01:37:00.124
and based on your experience with them in battle

01:37:00.124 --> 01:37:01.454
and Molly in the past,

01:37:01.454 --> 01:37:03.204
this appeared to be some sort of

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.447
ritualistic use of vitality, yes.

01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:08.280
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:37:09.451 --> 01:37:12.677
MARISHA: Any idea of what they were trying to investigate?

01:37:14.694 --> 01:37:15.764
SAM: Could have been a magic spell

01:37:15.764 --> 01:37:18.869
to communicate with you in your sleep, or something.

01:37:18.869 --> 01:37:19.702
MATT: Could have been.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

01:37:19.702 --> 01:37:21.314
TRAVIS: Could have been lighting up a sword for light.

01:37:21.314 --> 01:37:23.284
Is it real dark down here?

01:37:23.284 --> 01:37:25.324
MATT: It's not as dark as previous chambers.

01:37:25.324 --> 01:37:27.214
You do have occasional sources of light in here.

01:37:27.214 --> 01:37:28.614
Of a lot of the places you've been,

01:37:28.614 --> 01:37:31.344
this one is actually fairly well-lit in places.

01:37:31.344 --> 01:37:34.104
There are walks of this space where it gets darker,

01:37:34.104 --> 01:37:37.384
where there aren't functioning, or visible light sources.

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:40.234
But enough where you can see the tunnel continues on

01:37:40.234 --> 01:37:41.764
and maybe about--

01:37:42.624 --> 01:37:44.414
maybe 80 to 100 feet in

01:37:44.414 --> 01:37:47.814
you can see it leads into another chamber and splits.

01:37:47.814 --> 01:37:48.714
TRAVIS: Shall we?

01:37:48.714 --> 01:37:50.014
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:50.014 --> 01:37:51.994
Is it about that time,

01:37:51.994 --> 01:37:56.506
has it been a few hours since we left our sleep camp?

01:37:56.506 --> 01:37:58.181
SAM: Oh, yeah. Are we hungry?

01:37:58.181 --> 01:38:00.147
MATT: It's probably about two hours or so since.

01:38:00.147 --> 01:38:00.980
LAURA: Just two hours?

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.900
MATT: Two and a half hours, maybe.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:04.714
TRAVIS: So we might have two to four left of the Heroes'--?

01:38:04.714 --> 01:38:06.224
MATT: Yeah, you would know the duration of it.

01:38:06.224 --> 01:38:08.066
I'd say you have about an hour left.

01:38:08.066 --> 01:38:09.550
LAURA: (scoffs) Just an hour.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:12.058
MARISHA: And then, so, wait, it goes--

01:38:12.058 --> 01:38:15.017
The floors continue to go down as well, correct?

01:38:15.017 --> 01:38:15.954
We've got these tunnels,

01:38:15.954 --> 01:38:18.184
but then they continue to drop down?

01:38:18.184 --> 01:38:21.279
MATT: They do, though the distance shifts.

01:38:21.279 --> 01:38:23.884
It isn't a continuous floor after floor after floor.

01:38:23.884 --> 01:38:25.494
Sometimes they're off kilter,

01:38:25.494 --> 01:38:26.714
They're built at different angles,

01:38:26.714 --> 01:38:29.334
and this is just what's available at this cross-section.

01:38:29.334 --> 01:38:31.634
MARISHA: Any type of indication of what direction

01:38:31.634 --> 01:38:32.654
they might've gone?

01:38:32.654 --> 01:38:37.102
Shuffling of dust as they put out the campfire,

01:38:37.102 --> 01:38:38.254
or anything like that?

01:38:38.254 --> 01:38:40.704
MATT: The best gauge you have is that the spatter of blood

01:38:40.704 --> 01:38:43.394
is about ten feet into the hall

01:38:43.394 --> 01:38:44.434
from where they were staying.

01:38:44.434 --> 01:38:45.267
MARISHA: All right.

01:38:45.267 --> 01:38:47.024
TRAVIS: Let's get it.
MARISHA: Let's do it.

01:38:47.024 --> 01:38:50.694
LAURA: This Heroes' Feast takes an hour to consume,

01:38:50.694 --> 01:38:53.870
so you guys decide whether or not it's worth it.

01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:55.134
TRAVIS: Is that our last chalice?

01:38:55.134 --> 01:38:57.384
MARISHA: Yeah, next time we take a short rest, maybe?

01:38:58.384 --> 01:38:59.217
LAURA: Okay.

01:38:59.217 --> 01:39:00.144
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

01:39:00.144 --> 01:39:01.774
SAM: We're going into this hallway?

01:39:01.774 --> 01:39:02.607
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:39:02.607 --> 01:39:03.574
SAM: Okay.

01:39:03.574 --> 01:39:04.624
TRAVIS: I'll go, I have darkvision,

01:39:04.624 --> 01:39:06.967
I can be eyes for you.

01:39:06.967 --> 01:39:11.034
MARISHA: And this is the hallway that's not labeled

01:39:11.034 --> 01:39:12.359
energy elemental funneling?

01:39:12.359 --> 01:39:13.920
LAURA: This is the next one down.
MARISHA: This is unlabeled.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:14.886
LAURA: This is down.
MARISHA: Oh, oh.

01:39:14.886 --> 01:39:16.334
MATT: This one floor lower, you have no idea.

01:39:16.334 --> 01:39:17.174
LAURA: Is there any writing?

01:39:17.174 --> 01:39:18.314
MARISHA: Yes.

01:39:18.314 --> 01:39:20.295
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:39:20.295 --> 01:39:21.128
TALIESIN: I'll assist with that.

01:39:21.128 --> 01:39:23.211
LAURA: Also--
TRAVIS: It just says, "Get fucked."

01:39:24.724 --> 01:39:26.935
LAURA: Ooh, natural 20!

01:39:26.935 --> 01:39:30.422
Plus one, plus five is 26.

01:39:30.422 --> 01:39:32.074
MATT: Nice!
LAURA: Total, but natural 20.

01:39:32.074 --> 01:39:34.204
MATT: Nothing in particular in this hallway

01:39:34.204 --> 01:39:36.584
that you're walking down has any sort of writing on it,

01:39:36.584 --> 01:39:38.984
but I will gauge that roll as you progress.

01:39:38.984 --> 01:39:40.384
LAURA: Okay.

01:39:40.384 --> 01:39:42.908
MATT: So what's the marching order here?

01:39:42.908 --> 01:39:44.274
SAM: Fjord and Veth.

01:39:45.524 --> 01:39:47.702
LAURA: I'll follow.

01:39:47.702 --> 01:39:48.627
MATT: All right.
LAURA: So I can

01:39:48.627 --> 01:39:50.644
be up there for the perception roll.

01:39:50.644 --> 01:39:55.644
MATT: All right, and I will put next to you our friend.

01:39:56.334 --> 01:39:57.344
Here we go.

01:39:57.344 --> 01:39:58.944
All right, who's next to Jester?

01:40:00.434 --> 01:40:01.594
ASHLEY: I'll go.

01:40:01.594 --> 01:40:02.914
MATT: All right, Yasha.

01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:04.063
TALIESIN: I'll go behind them.
LAURA: Are you still a sparrow?

01:40:04.063 --> 01:40:05.304
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:40:05.304 --> 01:40:06.137
MATT: All right.

01:40:07.984 --> 01:40:09.014
MARISHA: I'll bring up the rear.

01:40:09.014 --> 01:40:11.231
MATT: All right, so then we'll put Essek in the center,

01:40:11.231 --> 01:40:13.270
and then Caleb and Beauregard at the rear.

01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:14.486
LIAM: Caleb is still a sparrow,

01:40:14.486 --> 01:40:19.424
and has landed on Charlie's head.

01:40:19.424 --> 01:40:20.257
MATT: Fair enough.

01:40:20.257 --> 01:40:23.395
LIAM: You will occasionally hear a little (tinging).

01:40:23.395 --> 01:40:24.636
SAM: So I'm picturing--

01:40:24.636 --> 01:40:28.073
MATT: I'll just use this tiny frog to be your sparrow.

01:40:28.073 --> 01:40:31.704
SAM: I'm picturing Jester holding Sprinkle,

01:40:31.704 --> 01:40:33.914
with Charlie on top of Sprinkle,

01:40:33.914 --> 01:40:35.809
and Caleb on top of Charlie.
LAURA: Yes.

01:40:35.809 --> 01:40:37.073
MATT: Correct.

01:40:37.073 --> 01:40:38.706
LAURA: I am a walking zoo.

01:40:39.834 --> 01:40:42.494
MATT: All right, continuing onward.

01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:46.181
LAURA: Like the hoarding lady in Labyrinth, you know?

01:40:46.181 --> 01:40:48.046
LIAM: Oh, you need this, you know.

01:40:48.046 --> 01:40:49.927
You need this, oh yeah.

01:40:49.927 --> 01:40:50.881
LAURA: Here you go, darling.

01:40:50.881 --> 01:40:52.632
MATT: What, you want your little pencil box?

01:40:52.632 --> 01:40:53.799
Yes, yes, yes.

01:40:56.934 --> 01:40:59.684
You continue on for about 80 or so feet,

01:40:59.684 --> 01:41:01.454
and the hall ends in an arch

01:41:01.454 --> 01:41:04.687
that continues into a square-like chamber.

01:41:06.014 --> 01:41:08.997
But a heavy portion of the central roof has fallen in,

01:41:08.997 --> 01:41:10.894
(crashing) and what was once probably

01:41:10.894 --> 01:41:15.894
a much larger room is now divided like a doughnut, in a way.

01:41:16.234 --> 01:41:18.274
There is just a large segment

01:41:18.274 --> 01:41:20.914
of rubble and broken ceiling that's caved inward.

01:41:20.914 --> 01:41:25.507
And there is a central pillar of rough, destroyed structure.

01:41:27.264 --> 01:41:28.694
You can see edges of the room

01:41:28.694 --> 01:41:31.234
have also similarly crumbled in a bit.

01:41:31.234 --> 01:41:32.814
There are, embedded to the right

01:41:32.814 --> 01:41:33.944
and a little further into the left,

01:41:33.944 --> 01:41:38.534
these foggy, filthy-looking glass columns.

01:41:38.534 --> 01:41:39.384
There are other columns

01:41:39.384 --> 01:41:42.234
in the chamber that have fallen and broken and left open.

01:41:43.454 --> 01:41:48.174
And you can see the next flashing source of orange light

01:41:48.174 --> 01:41:50.524
is not in sight, but you can see the source of it

01:41:50.524 --> 01:41:52.980
on the opposite side of this collapsed pillar.

01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.005
MARISHA: (gasps)

01:41:54.005 --> 01:41:55.727
LAURA: This is where the creatures come from.

01:41:55.727 --> 01:41:56.981
MARISHA: Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to be careful,

01:41:56.981 --> 01:41:59.741
and I shove Veth in.
SAM: (surprised noise)

01:41:59.741 --> 01:42:01.189
All right. well, I'll just keep going.

01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:02.414
MATT: You step into the room?

01:42:02.414 --> 01:42:03.394
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Be careful, Veth.

01:42:03.394 --> 01:42:04.474
MATT: Nothing happens.

01:42:04.474 --> 01:42:05.604
SAM: No problem.

01:42:05.604 --> 01:42:08.864
I'll go walk around the doughnut towards the light.

01:42:08.864 --> 01:42:10.094
MATT: Okay, stealthily?

01:42:10.094 --> 01:42:11.104
SAM: Stealthily.

01:42:11.104 --> 01:42:12.604
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me.

01:42:15.924 --> 01:42:17.154
SAM: 29.

01:42:17.154 --> 01:42:18.337
MATT: 29, nice.

01:42:19.664 --> 01:42:21.174
Carefully, you maneuver around,

01:42:21.174 --> 01:42:23.887
that light pulses and flickers a bit.

01:42:24.834 --> 01:42:26.964
And as you head around-- to the right or the left?

01:42:26.964 --> 01:42:27.797
SAM: To the right.

01:42:27.797 --> 01:42:29.014
MATT: To the right.

01:42:29.014 --> 01:42:32.024
Arcing around, you can see there is

01:42:32.024 --> 01:42:35.664
another hallway that leaves this area

01:42:35.664 --> 01:42:36.847
to the right-hand side.

01:42:37.755 --> 01:42:41.134
You can see there is a large metallic door

01:42:41.134 --> 01:42:44.074
that is on the opposite wall from where you guys entered

01:42:44.074 --> 01:42:45.526
on the far, far side.

01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:46.567
SAM: Near the orange light?

01:42:46.567 --> 01:42:48.624
MATT: Yeah, beyond the orange light.

01:42:48.624 --> 01:42:51.514
That is closed, that appears to be intact.

01:42:53.094 --> 01:42:55.204
You can see a raised platform

01:42:55.204 --> 01:42:58.107
on the left-hand side of the far corner

01:42:59.094 --> 01:43:01.474
where there's a raised pillar

01:43:01.474 --> 01:43:03.314
and some sort of a metallic contraption

01:43:03.314 --> 01:43:07.074
that is placed on top that you have never

01:43:07.074 --> 01:43:09.576
really necessarily seen anything like before.

01:43:09.576 --> 01:43:13.674
And then beyond that, another hall that exits this room.

01:43:13.674 --> 01:43:15.054
If you continue in the chamber

01:43:15.054 --> 01:43:16.341
there's two hallways to go out this way

01:43:16.341 --> 01:43:18.094
and a door on the opposite side.

01:43:18.094 --> 01:43:19.314
There's the center that is collapsed,

01:43:19.314 --> 01:43:21.346
and there was a raised pillar with a contraption on it.

01:43:21.346 --> 01:43:22.834
LAURA: Cool.
SAM: Ay yi yi.

01:43:22.834 --> 01:43:25.764
LAURA: Did my perception let me see any words in this room?

01:43:25.764 --> 01:43:27.384
MATT: Are you following?

01:43:27.384 --> 01:43:28.714
LAURA: Oh, I guess I'm third in line.

01:43:28.714 --> 01:43:30.414
SAM: Do I see any animals, or creatures,

01:43:30.414 --> 01:43:31.897
or monsters?
TRAVIS: The contraption is like,

01:43:31.897 --> 01:43:34.722
hand-held contraption size, or contraption?

01:43:34.722 --> 01:43:36.160
LAURA: Or like--

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.837
MATT: The pillar-
LAURA: -- football size?

01:43:38.884 --> 01:43:41.424
MATT: The pillar itself is about eight feet wide,

01:43:41.424 --> 01:43:44.003
and the contraption is about a similar width.

01:43:44.003 --> 01:43:45.154
SAM and LAURA: Oh.

01:43:45.154 --> 01:43:46.874
MATT: But you're uncertain as to what its function is.

01:43:46.874 --> 01:43:48.104
SAM: A super computer.

01:43:48.104 --> 01:43:48.937
It's Whopper.

01:43:48.937 --> 01:43:51.600
TRAVIS: It's Charlie's big brother.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.458
Charlie bit me.

01:43:52.458 --> 01:43:54.532
SAM: Did I see any animals, or creatures, or monsters?

01:43:54.532 --> 01:43:56.414
TALIESIN: Oh my.
MATT: No.

01:43:56.414 --> 01:43:57.544
SAM: It looks clear.

01:43:57.544 --> 01:44:01.344
Want to come see these platforms of weird robit stuff?

01:44:01.344 --> 01:44:05.506
MARISHA: I'm going to branch off to
the end and take the left route.

01:44:05.506 --> 01:44:06.574
MATT: Take the left route?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm,

01:44:06.574 --> 01:44:09.384
just as we all get to the other side.

01:44:09.384 --> 01:44:10.838
MATT: Okay.

01:44:10.838 --> 01:44:12.474
So you head to the left route off the opposite edge.

01:44:12.474 --> 01:44:15.674
You pass by the rubble, and the fog glass column,

01:44:15.674 --> 01:44:16.564
and the broken column there.

01:44:16.564 --> 01:44:18.874
You can see the pillar with the metallic thing

01:44:18.874 --> 01:44:21.514
sitting up right there in front of you, and the door.

01:44:21.514 --> 01:44:23.961
TRAVIS: I'll sweep right to the opposite.

01:44:23.961 --> 01:44:28.014
MARISHA: Anything in those tubes,

01:44:28.014 --> 01:44:29.847
the foggy glass tubes?
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:44:30.799 --> 01:44:32.049
TRAVIS: I'll assist.

01:44:33.134 --> 01:44:35.443
MARISHA: Natural 20 again!

01:44:35.443 --> 01:44:36.276
MATT: Nice!

01:44:37.253 --> 01:44:40.074
MARISHA: And a four, so I'll take that natural 20.

01:44:40.074 --> 01:44:41.996
Thanks, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

01:44:41.996 --> 01:44:43.662
MARISHA: What was it, perception? So it was 24.

01:44:43.662 --> 01:44:45.974
MATT: Yeah, glancing inside, it is filthy.

01:44:45.974 --> 01:44:47.434
When I say that it's fogged up,

01:44:47.434 --> 01:44:49.434
it's like the bottom of an aquarium

01:44:49.434 --> 01:44:52.704
that hasn't been cleaned out in 40 years.

01:44:52.704 --> 01:44:55.664
It is just this black, dark, brackish sediment

01:44:55.664 --> 01:44:57.974
that is largely clustered on the bottom of it.

01:44:57.974 --> 01:45:00.214
It looks like it may be hollow,

01:45:00.214 --> 01:45:01.754
or has contained something.

01:45:01.754 --> 01:45:03.594
But it is so dark, that it's very little to see there,

01:45:03.594 --> 01:45:05.487
but there is something within it.

01:45:07.592 --> 01:45:08.634
MARISHA: There is something in it?

01:45:08.634 --> 01:45:09.467
MATT: There's nothing moving,

01:45:09.467 --> 01:45:11.944
but you can see there's something being contained within it.

01:45:11.944 --> 01:45:13.544
MARISHA: Okay, can I tell what that is?

01:45:15.354 --> 01:45:17.334
MATT: Unfortunately, a little too-- And even with that roll

01:45:17.334 --> 01:45:19.424
you're able to see something
in there where normally wouldn't.

01:45:19.424 --> 01:45:22.624
But you're uncertain as to what the shape it would be.

01:45:22.624 --> 01:45:23.944
MARISHA: Okay.

01:45:23.944 --> 01:45:25.949
I'm going to keep going and connect with everybody.

01:45:25.949 --> 01:45:27.406
MATT: Okay.

01:45:27.406 --> 01:45:32.074
LAURA: Do I see any words with my natural 20 that I rolled?

01:45:32.074 --> 01:45:35.074
MATT: You do, you see above the sealed door

01:45:35.074 --> 01:45:37.894
there is Aeorian text there.

01:45:37.894 --> 01:45:40.964
The left room has text above it,

01:45:40.964 --> 01:45:43.254
and the right one has text above it as well.

01:45:43.254 --> 01:45:44.754
LAURA: Charlie, can you read those?

01:45:46.244 --> 01:45:47.551
MATT: "Oh, right,"

01:45:47.551 --> 01:45:49.774
and he looks above the sealed door,

01:45:49.774 --> 01:45:51.884
and that one reads, he says,

01:45:51.884 --> 01:45:55.493
"Rejuvenation Experimentation,
Team Athodan admittance only."

01:45:55.493 --> 01:45:58.217
SAM: Athodan.
MARISHA: Admittance.

01:45:59.524 --> 01:46:02.115
LAURA: Bracelet.
MATT: Looks at the left one and goes,

01:46:02.115 --> 01:46:03.341
"Repair terminal."

01:46:03.341 --> 01:46:06.451
SAM: (gasps) That's good for Charlie!
MARISHA: Hey!

01:46:06.451 --> 01:46:07.487
TRAVIS: Charlie's going to kill us.

01:46:07.487 --> 01:46:09.494
LAURA: What about to the right?

01:46:09.494 --> 01:46:10.327
MATT: "Maintenance."

01:46:11.244 --> 01:46:12.077
SAM: What was that?

01:46:12.077 --> 01:46:13.937
MATT: "Maintenance."
SAM: Oh, maintenance.

01:46:14.964 --> 01:46:17.264
These are great, two out of three are perfect.

01:46:17.264 --> 01:46:18.804
We need to fix Charlie,

01:46:18.804 --> 01:46:22.469
we need to go see this rejuvenation thing, right?

01:46:22.469 --> 01:46:26.264
LAURA: Should we peek into the repair room then?

01:46:26.264 --> 01:46:27.924
SAM: Fix up Charlie?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:46:27.924 --> 01:46:29.714
LIAM: Sparrow flutters down and lands on the ground

01:46:29.714 --> 01:46:32.889
next to Veth and I go back to human form.

01:46:32.889 --> 01:46:33.722
TALIESIN: (startled noise)

01:46:36.034 --> 01:46:37.172
MARISHA: Oh, you're in human form.

01:46:37.172 --> 01:46:38.956
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Oh.

01:46:38.956 --> 01:46:40.824
LIAM: This is a lot.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:46:40.824 --> 01:46:41.657
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:46:42.632 --> 01:46:45.414
LAURA: Hey Charlie, can you
stop listening to us for a second?

01:46:45.414 --> 01:46:46.247
MATT: "All right."

01:46:47.204 --> 01:46:50.124
LAURA: Do you think it's smart to repair Charlie?

01:46:50.124 --> 01:46:51.024
TRAVIS: No.

01:46:51.024 --> 01:46:52.964
SAM: Why would it not be smart to repair Charlie?

01:46:52.964 --> 01:46:54.974
He's a sweet boy.

01:46:54.974 --> 01:46:58.704
MARISHA: In case his brain comes back online

01:46:58.704 --> 01:47:00.124
and he's like a--

01:47:00.124 --> 01:47:01.504
LAURA: An evil destruction robot.

01:47:01.504 --> 01:47:02.337
MARISHA: He's like, "Yeah,

01:47:02.337 --> 01:47:05.636
"out for termination of any living creatures." Sure.

01:47:05.636 --> 01:47:08.714
SAM: Why would you assume any of that?

01:47:08.714 --> 01:47:11.064
He's like a helper. He's a helper-bot.
LAURA: Why has his

01:47:11.064 --> 01:47:13.724
memory been affected every time

01:47:13.724 --> 01:47:15.704
we bring up anything with the Somnovem,

01:47:15.704 --> 01:47:17.194
or the Cognouza Ward.

01:47:17.194 --> 01:47:19.544
SAM: That's not the only things that he's forgotten.

01:47:20.414 --> 01:47:23.514
MARISHA: Did you watch Raised By Wolves? Come on.

01:47:23.514 --> 01:47:24.924
TALIESIN: I'll also say, if there's a way

01:47:24.924 --> 01:47:27.387
to get his brain online before his feet.

01:47:28.654 --> 01:47:29.487
LAURA: That's true.

01:47:32.575 --> 01:47:33.754
Dink dink dink!

01:47:33.754 --> 01:47:35.004
MATT: "Hi."
LAURA: Hi.

01:47:35.004 --> 01:47:36.029
MATT: "Hello."
LAURA: Okay,

01:47:36.029 --> 01:47:38.904
should we go into the repair ward then?

01:47:38.904 --> 01:47:39.737
Yeah, okay.

01:47:42.094 --> 01:47:43.384
MATT: "Can I listen now?"

01:47:43.384 --> 01:47:44.313
LAURA: Yes, you may.

01:47:44.313 --> 01:47:46.294
MATT: You see this tiny (fizzles) little

01:47:46.294 --> 01:47:49.317
holes in the sides of his head, unshielded.

01:47:51.474 --> 01:47:55.194
So you continue on down the left hall, then?

01:47:55.194 --> 01:47:57.234
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Yeah.

01:47:57.234 --> 01:47:59.654
MATT: All right, following down for about 40 or so feet,

01:47:59.654 --> 01:48:02.844
it comes to a cylindrical chamber about 40 feet across.

01:48:02.844 --> 01:48:04.774
Part of it has fallen in,

01:48:04.774 --> 01:48:06.524
and the back wall is a bunch of

01:48:06.524 --> 01:48:08.604
rebar-like metal structures that point forward.

01:48:08.604 --> 01:48:10.944
In the center, you can see there was

01:48:10.944 --> 01:48:14.874
based in the floor, a ten-foot radius, dome-like structure

01:48:14.874 --> 01:48:16.834
that has been slightly pushed up and dislodged.

01:48:16.834 --> 01:48:20.694
And you can see there is a line where it may have opened,

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:23.587
but it is currently off to the side.

01:48:27.113 --> 01:48:28.254
SAM: Any--

01:48:28.254 --> 01:48:31.262
Just like a capsule that was holding something?

01:48:31.262 --> 01:48:32.274
MATT: That's kind of what it looks like.

01:48:32.274 --> 01:48:34.424
It looks like some sort of a spherical,

01:48:34.424 --> 01:48:36.574
you can see only the top half of it

01:48:36.574 --> 01:48:38.004
like it was embedded in the ground.

01:48:38.004 --> 01:48:41.671
And it has what looks like doors that can open on the sides,

01:48:41.671 --> 01:48:45.596
but it is currently slightly
pushed up and out of its housing.

01:48:48.232 --> 01:48:50.444
TRAVIS: Opaque sphere or transparent?

01:48:50.444 --> 01:48:51.684
MATT: No, opaque.

01:48:51.684 --> 01:48:54.385
Like a brass, goldish color.

01:48:54.385 --> 01:48:55.752
LAURA: Like a containment feel that's been--
TRAVIS: Yasha, help me

01:48:55.752 --> 01:48:57.254
see if we can shove this thing back in,

01:48:57.254 --> 01:48:59.807
and we'll also check the back of the room.

01:48:59.807 --> 01:49:00.649
ASHLEY: I'll come and help.

01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:02.661
TRAVIS: We'll go over and put
our hands on either side of it,

01:49:02.661 --> 01:49:04.655
and try and get it back.

01:49:04.655 --> 01:49:06.514
MATT: Have you both roll strength checks,

01:49:06.514 --> 01:49:07.994
or one with the advantage.

01:49:07.994 --> 01:49:09.574
TRAVIS: I'll give you an advantage.

01:49:09.574 --> 01:49:11.390
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:12.693
TRAVIS: You know.

01:49:12.693 --> 01:49:13.959
ASHLEY: Ooh.

01:49:13.959 --> 01:49:15.800
That would be--

01:49:17.654 --> 01:49:19.014
26.

01:49:19.014 --> 01:49:20.234
MATT: 26.

01:49:20.234 --> 01:49:23.397
You both at the same time shove, and as you do,

01:49:23.397 --> 01:49:26.574
(heavy sliding) it slides into place.

01:49:26.574 --> 01:49:28.751
As it does, some pieces of the metal rebars,

01:49:28.751 --> 01:49:30.894
(clanging) hits the ground.

01:49:30.894 --> 01:49:33.894
Loud, heavy metal clanging sounds echo through the hall.

01:49:33.894 --> 01:49:37.124
But as it sits into place, (whooshing)

01:49:37.124 --> 01:49:38.784
the doors open with a slight hissing sound,

01:49:38.784 --> 01:49:40.614
and on the inside, you can see

01:49:40.614 --> 01:49:42.834
there is a cushioned interior

01:49:42.834 --> 01:49:46.214
with a number of small, metallic objects

01:49:46.214 --> 01:49:48.714
and slight arcane flashing bits of energy,

01:49:48.714 --> 01:49:50.264
that are just waiting.

01:49:50.264 --> 01:49:54.462
Like a terrifying dentist arrangement of devices,

01:49:54.462 --> 01:49:55.914
that fill the interior.

01:49:55.914 --> 01:49:57.034
MARISHA: And there's nothing sitting

01:49:57.034 --> 01:49:58.414
on that little pillow, I'm assuming?

01:49:58.414 --> 01:50:00.409
MATT: No.
LAURA: We should put Charlie on the pillow,

01:50:00.409 --> 01:50:02.750
and step out.

01:50:03.844 --> 01:50:05.789
TALIESIN: So my feeling--
MARISHA: (giggles)

01:50:07.164 --> 01:50:09.139
TALIESIN: It's a risk.
LAURA: Uh-huh.

01:50:09.139 --> 01:50:11.374
TALIESIN: I think it's--

01:50:11.374 --> 01:50:13.724
I don't know, I think it's a risk worth taking.

01:50:15.044 --> 01:50:16.914
LIAM: When we found Charlie, was he

01:50:16.914 --> 01:50:20.494
just as filthy and an ancient-looking?

01:50:20.494 --> 01:50:21.524
He was, right?

01:50:21.524 --> 01:50:22.694
As all the rubble around him.

01:50:22.694 --> 01:50:24.114
MATT: Yeah.

01:50:24.114 --> 01:50:27.154
He looked like he was in a similar place

01:50:27.154 --> 01:50:30.044
of ancient disrepair and--

01:50:31.194 --> 01:50:32.944
Forgotten like the rest of Aeor.

01:50:32.944 --> 01:50:34.260
LIAM: Right, well,

01:50:35.324 --> 01:50:37.424
everything that I just skimmed upstairs,

01:50:37.424 --> 01:50:38.824
and it was only a few moments,

01:50:38.824 --> 01:50:42.594
but made it seem like the Somnovem were pariahs.

01:50:42.594 --> 01:50:43.444
MARISHA: Really?

01:50:43.444 --> 01:50:46.244
LIAM: Yes, like they had pushed the envelope too far

01:50:46.244 --> 01:50:48.344
on the things they were trying and were

01:50:50.074 --> 01:50:53.144
forbidden from entering areas of the rest of the city.

01:50:53.144 --> 01:50:56.984
So if Charlie was in the Praesidis Ward, right?

01:50:56.984 --> 01:50:58.642
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Praesidis Ward.

01:51:00.176 --> 01:51:02.164
I mean, there's no guarantees down here,

01:51:02.164 --> 01:51:05.219
but it seems like he would not be related to them.

01:51:07.224 --> 01:51:08.629
I don't know what he is.
TALIESIN: How did he look

01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:10.170
when we found--

01:51:11.334 --> 01:51:14.576
What position was he in
in relation to other people?

01:51:15.423 --> 01:51:17.856
Did people that die afraid of it?

01:51:17.856 --> 01:51:20.434
MATT: No, he was next to the dais,

01:51:20.434 --> 01:51:22.844
along with the other bodies, he was slumped forward

01:51:22.844 --> 01:51:26.454
with the damaged, partially open chest plate.

01:51:26.454 --> 01:51:27.660
He's well-decorated,

01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.474
there's a lot of intricate detail into him,

01:51:29.474 --> 01:51:32.091
more so than the first one that you had seen.

01:51:36.514 --> 01:51:38.376
TALIESIN: We'll ready ourselves if we have to do something,

01:51:38.376 --> 01:51:41.197
but I say we take a risk.

01:51:41.197 --> 01:51:42.097
LAURA: Let's give it a try.

01:51:42.097 --> 01:51:44.684
TALIESIN: I'm going to regret saying that so much.

01:51:44.684 --> 01:51:45.537
MARISHA: Plop him in.

01:51:46.504 --> 01:51:47.794
LAURA: I put him on the pillow.

01:51:47.794 --> 01:51:50.074
Charlie, do you know how to make this thing work?

01:51:50.074 --> 01:51:51.314
MATT: "I assume that it--"

01:51:51.314 --> 01:51:54.104
and at which point the doors start closing

01:51:54.104 --> 01:51:55.704
as you back away and pull.

01:51:55.704 --> 01:51:57.424
The doors (thump).

01:51:57.424 --> 01:52:00.237
You hear this muffled, "All right,

01:52:01.294 --> 01:52:02.731
"I think--"

01:52:02.731 --> 01:52:03.564
(high-pitched whirring)

01:52:03.564 --> 01:52:05.154
This high-pitched whirring sound.

01:52:05.154 --> 01:52:07.831
TALIESIN: I'm going to back behind it.
MATT: (whirring)

01:52:07.831 --> 01:52:12.831
(grinding and whirring)

01:52:12.874 --> 01:52:15.604
You watch as some of the other pieces of rubble

01:52:15.604 --> 01:52:17.374
that came to rest at the back

01:52:17.374 --> 01:52:18.817
after it was shifted into place.

01:52:18.817 --> 01:52:20.526
being vibrating off (clanks)

01:52:20.526 --> 01:52:21.724
and hitting ground around it.

01:52:21.724 --> 01:52:22.634
The room's shaking,

01:52:22.634 --> 01:52:25.300
like an imbalanced washing machine.

01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:28.054
LAURA: Uh-huh.
MARISHA: (nervous laugh)

01:52:28.054 --> 01:52:29.604
I'm just going to look behind me.

01:52:29.604 --> 01:52:31.094
LAURA: Yeah, keep an eye out.

01:52:31.094 --> 01:52:33.957
LAURA: Should really have cast Silence or something.

01:52:33.957 --> 01:52:37.284
MARISHA: Oh shit, that probably would've been smart.

01:52:37.284 --> 01:52:39.424
Well, we're just listening and watching now.

01:52:39.424 --> 01:52:41.154
What, why are you looking at that?

01:52:41.154 --> 01:52:44.707
MATT: A minute passes, two minutes pass.

01:52:46.074 --> 01:52:48.444
Five minutes pass as these whirring sounds,

01:52:48.444 --> 01:52:50.544
and heavy thuds, and metallic clangs

01:52:50.544 --> 01:52:52.954
and buzzing of energy seems to

01:52:52.954 --> 01:52:55.074
emanate from the interior of the strange orb.

01:52:55.074 --> 01:52:57.494
You occasionally see it shift in place.

01:52:57.494 --> 01:52:59.927
Until eventually all the sound stops.

01:53:02.845 --> 01:53:04.014
(air whooshing out)

01:53:04.014 --> 01:53:08.474
The doors open as a mist-like smoke emerges from the inside.

01:53:08.474 --> 01:53:10.424
MARISHA: He's super hot now.
LAURA: Vision walks out.

01:53:10.424 --> 01:53:11.257
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:53:11.257 --> 01:53:13.437
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Captain America comes out.

01:53:13.437 --> 01:53:14.616
MATT: And we're going to take a break!

01:53:14.616 --> 01:53:16.394
(yelling and laughter)

01:53:16.394 --> 01:53:17.534
Because we've been going for a little bit,

01:53:17.534 --> 01:53:19.707
and we'll pick up with the reveal after the break.

01:53:19.707 --> 01:53:22.722
LIAM: (like Vision) Can I make you all some coffee?

01:53:22.722 --> 01:53:23.619
(laughter)

01:53:23.619 --> 01:53:26.027
TALIESIN: I see Prince from the Batdance. Just.

01:53:26.027 --> 01:53:26.981
LAURA: Oh my goodness.

01:53:26.981 --> 01:53:28.910
MATT: Yes!
ASHLEY: T-1000.

01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:30.376
TALIESIN: ♪ Funk up! ♪

01:53:31.254 --> 01:53:32.087
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Save me,

01:53:32.087 --> 01:53:33.794
Paul Bettany, save me.

01:53:33.794 --> 01:53:36.154
(laughter)

01:53:36.154 --> 01:53:37.454
MATT: All right, we'll be back here in a few minutes,

01:53:37.454 --> 01:53:38.757
we'll see you guys shortly.

01:53:41.205 --> 01:53:44.738
So, you're the adventurers they've been talking about

01:53:45.557 --> 01:53:49.013
and you've come to seek my guidance.

01:53:49.014 --> 01:53:51.891
I've battled the most unspeakable horrors

01:53:51.892 --> 01:53:55.510
to crawl upon the face of this tainted land.

01:53:55.511 --> 01:53:59.181
Even faced evils that claw and gnash

01:53:59.182 --> 01:54:03.791
from twisted forms bent on destruction and slaughter.

01:54:04.856 --> 01:54:07.926
Though, it is the monsters inside us

01:54:07.927 --> 01:54:10.034
that take the greatest toll.

01:54:11.286 --> 01:54:13.868
Your tools will be your life.

01:54:13.869 --> 01:54:17.294
Every elixir, potion, and concoction,

01:54:17.295 --> 01:54:19.779
a powerful weapon on your hands.

01:54:20.742 --> 01:54:24.208
Each victory will bring you closer to your next,

01:54:24.209 --> 01:54:28.316
equipping you to face the darkness of this land.

01:54:28.317 --> 01:54:30.673
Failing is not an option,

01:54:30.674 --> 01:54:34.198
lest a fate far worse than death greet you.

01:54:34.855 --> 01:54:37.650
So tell me, strangers,

01:54:37.651 --> 01:54:42.435
do you tremble at night, haunted by visions of the dead?

01:54:42.436 --> 01:54:47.520
Does the sound of the infernal rattling their demonic chains

01:54:47.738 --> 01:54:49.226
chill your blood?

01:54:50.188 --> 01:54:54.631
Do you cower at the thought of losing all you love

01:54:54.632 --> 01:54:57.681
to the corruption of the beast?

01:54:57.682 --> 01:55:02.766
No? Well, perhaps you have what it takes.

01:55:03.488 --> 01:55:08.012
With this tome of knowledge, your training begins.

01:55:08.013 --> 01:55:10.497
Let's see how far you get.

01:55:12.186 --> 01:55:14.982
(dragon roaring)

01:55:19.359 --> 01:55:22.580
(heavy, brassy music)

01:55:24.188 --> 01:55:25.289
Dwarvenite.

01:55:26.809 --> 01:55:30.975
The most precious substance among Dwarven smiths.

01:55:30.976 --> 01:55:32.604
(metal clanging)

01:55:32.605 --> 01:55:36.954
Able to absorb the very spirit of the craftsman.

01:55:36.955 --> 01:55:39.751
(echoing static)

01:55:43.004 --> 01:55:47.013
Thus infused, it becomes nearly indestructible.

01:55:50.396 --> 01:55:54.476
Able to forge arrows that will last for generations.

01:55:55.614 --> 01:55:59.088
(music crests, crashing)

01:56:04.874 --> 01:56:06.229
Pure Dwarvenite.

01:56:07.581 --> 01:56:12.664
Now you can get your hands on this legendary substance

01:56:12.665 --> 01:56:15.400
with the new Dungeon of Doom

01:56:16.682 --> 01:56:20.687
available now at dwarvenforge.com

01:56:26.478 --> 01:56:29.152
That is also just the most perfect performance

01:56:29.153 --> 01:56:30.687
I've seen Travis do.

01:56:30.688 --> 01:56:32.810
In any arena, doing anything.

01:56:32.811 --> 01:56:34.332
(voices overlapping)

01:56:34.333 --> 01:56:36.883
Mr Willingham, you're accepted to Julliard.

01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:40.306
All it took was the Chutney monologue.

01:56:40.307 --> 01:56:42.965
Made popular here, on Narrative Telephone.

01:56:42.966 --> 01:56:46.559
Oh my god, how amazing would it be if, years from now,

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:50.839
we get word that someone was accepted into some institution

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.722
using the Chutney monologue.

01:56:52.723 --> 01:56:54.823
(all laughing)

01:56:54.886 --> 01:56:58.615
(pizzicato orchestra music)

01:57:12.676 --> 01:57:16.197
(light orchestral music)

01:57:16.198 --> 01:57:19.418
(typewriter clacking)

01:57:41.299 --> 01:57:43.277
Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:57:43.278 --> 01:57:46.163
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:57:46.164 --> 01:57:47.640
(spray can hissing)

01:57:47.641 --> 01:57:50.491
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

01:57:54.106 --> 01:57:56.890
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

01:57:59.751 --> 01:58:01.285
Roll an investigation if you want,

01:58:01.286 --> 01:58:03.709
it's basically perfect.

01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:08.476
(in British accent) Go ahead, darling, treat yourself.

01:58:11.485 --> 01:58:13.868
I mean, the Traveler always says impulse purchases

01:58:13.869 --> 01:58:15.122
are a good decision.

01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:20.230
So click on over to the critical role shop.

01:58:20.231 --> 01:58:22.287
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

01:58:22.288 --> 01:58:23.501
You've still got time.

01:58:28.227 --> 01:58:30.515
(grunting)

01:58:32.801 --> 01:58:33.980
Would you look at that?

01:58:33.981 --> 01:58:35.373
I think it worked.

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:37.468
You were right, Pumat number three.

01:58:37.469 --> 01:58:41.840
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

01:58:41.841 --> 01:58:42.962
Pumat number three?

01:58:45.397 --> 01:58:46.691
Oh boy.

01:58:46.692 --> 01:58:48.449
Well, hello there!

01:58:48.450 --> 01:58:49.944
I am Pumat Prime.

01:58:49.945 --> 01:58:53.415
It's good to finally join you here in the prime dimension.

01:58:53.416 --> 01:58:58.194
I see this is the Twitch Prime realm, I think?

01:58:59.238 --> 01:59:02.562
Oh! We're in the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

01:59:02.563 --> 01:59:03.965
Well, would you look at that.

01:59:03.966 --> 01:59:06.487
You got chat and everything. (chuckling)

01:59:06.488 --> 01:59:10.229
Respectfully, I was looking for the prime rib realm,

01:59:10.230 --> 01:59:12.944
but, this isn't too bad.

01:59:12.945 --> 01:59:15.232
You see, if you already have access

01:59:15.233 --> 01:59:18.353
to the Amazon Prime realm, you can get a free subscription

01:59:18.354 --> 01:59:20.449
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

01:59:20.519 --> 01:59:23.495
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship.

01:59:23.496 --> 01:59:25.918
after that peace treaty the prime minister signed

01:59:25.919 --> 01:59:27.544
a few years back.

01:59:27.545 --> 01:59:29.121
You just have to remember

01:59:29.122 --> 01:59:30.941
to renew your Twitch Prime subscription

01:59:30.942 --> 01:59:33.411
at the top of each month. Respectfully.

01:59:33.412 --> 01:59:36.167
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

01:59:36.168 --> 01:59:39.095
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

01:59:39.096 --> 01:59:40.956
using the Gift a Sub button.

01:59:40.957 --> 01:59:45.003
That is, assuming the empire hasn't sent the tax man

01:59:45.004 --> 01:59:46.959
to your shop here recently.

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:48.459
(nervous laughter)

01:59:48.562 --> 01:59:49.408
All right.

01:59:49.409 --> 01:59:52.292
Well, off to find that darn elusive prime rib realm.

01:59:52.293 --> 01:59:54.869
Who knew the prime dimension had so many pockets?

01:59:56.137 --> 01:59:56.984
Good luck.

01:59:59.430 --> 02:00:02.904
(distantly) Pumat three?

Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:56.590
MATT: And welcome back.

02:11:56.590 --> 02:11:58.950
So.
SAM: (quick exhale)

02:11:58.950 --> 02:12:00.900
MATT: As all of you await,

02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:03.960
the whirring and loud noises emanating

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.380
from this strange, spherical,

02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:10.150
engine-type sphere suddenly (air releasing).

02:12:10.150 --> 02:12:12.697
The doors open as a bit of mist and smoke apparates.

02:12:12.697 --> 02:12:14.365
SAM: -- covered in skin, I swear to god.

02:12:14.365 --> 02:12:15.420
MARISHA: I know!

02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:17.468
LIAM: Have you seen this boy?

02:12:17.468 --> 02:12:18.301
MARISHA: So weird!

02:12:19.323 --> 02:12:22.143
MATT: (impact) A hand emerges and grabs the side.

02:12:23.730 --> 02:12:27.090
Still metallic.
SAM: (sigh of relief)

02:12:27.090 --> 02:12:29.620
MATT: And standing up out of the sphere, tall,

02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:33.686
you see Charlie whole,

02:12:34.703 --> 02:12:37.886
cleaned, repaired,

02:12:37.886 --> 02:12:40.680
no visible damage or injury

02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.980
as to where you found him.

02:12:43.764 --> 02:12:45.014
He looks at all of you.

02:12:47.837 --> 02:12:49.270
"I am Devexian."

02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:53.370
SAM: Oh, oh, oh.
MARISHA: Oh, Devexian.

02:12:53.370 --> 02:12:56.560
SAM and LIAM: (laugh)

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:58.001
SAM: Oh boy.
TRAVIS: I'm here to here kill you all.

02:12:58.001 --> 02:13:01.440
MATT: "And I'm grateful for your aid in restoring myself."

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:02.737
MARISHA: Oh!

02:13:02.737 --> 02:13:07.737
MATT: "Might I ask, what has transpired here?"

02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:09.714
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:13:09.714 --> 02:13:11.330
MARISHA: Can we walk and talk?

02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:13.577
LAURA: Let's walk and talk.
MARISHA: Yeah, we're--

02:13:13.577 --> 02:13:14.843
(laughter)

02:13:14.843 --> 02:13:15.676
LAURA: Uh oh!
LIAM: That's a lot

02:13:15.676 --> 02:13:17.093
for a walk and talk.

02:13:18.482 --> 02:13:20.317
(laughter)

02:13:20.317 --> 02:13:21.340
MARISHA: Yeah, we're--
LAURA: Calm yourself, Veth,

02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:22.430
calm yourself.

02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:25.215
TRAVIS: Come on, it's not a minotaur, let's go.

02:13:25.215 --> 02:13:27.216
SAM: I don't know, that voice.

02:13:27.216 --> 02:13:29.150
(laughter)

02:13:29.150 --> 02:13:30.450
The confidence.

02:13:30.450 --> 02:13:34.216
(laughter)

02:13:35.727 --> 02:13:39.130
MATT: "Very well," and continues to begin striding back

02:13:39.130 --> 02:13:41.181
towards the central chamber, not waiting for you.

02:13:41.181 --> 02:13:43.260
LAURA: Okay Devexian, we have to be very quiet--

02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:47.260
what's the last thing you remember, Devexian, Vexian?

02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:50.760
MATT: He stops in the middle and
turns around, inspecting the space.

02:13:51.637 --> 02:13:53.450
"I was at a gathering."

02:13:53.450 --> 02:13:55.150
TALIESIN: What happened?
MATT: "My associate,

02:13:57.267 --> 02:13:59.973
"I genuinely do not remember.

02:14:01.327 --> 02:14:02.727
"That's why I'm asking you."

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:05.860
TALIESIN: We're going to try and--
MATT: "There was a--"

02:14:07.178 --> 02:14:09.550
and you see like introspection for a minute,

02:14:09.550 --> 02:14:12.350
the glow in the eyes dimming for a second

02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:14.183
like he's lost in thought.

02:14:16.370 --> 02:14:18.613
"Huh, huh.

02:14:21.187 --> 02:14:24.233
"I remember."
LAURA: (gasps)

02:14:25.987 --> 02:14:28.890
MATT: "I guess they found the experiment."

02:14:28.890 --> 02:14:30.520
MARISHA: I guess they found--

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:33.370
LAURA: You know about the Somnovem?

02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:37.340
SAM: Let's not pepper too many questions to Devexian.

02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:41.190
He's just been through an ordeal.

02:14:41.190 --> 02:14:42.347
Do you want to sit down,

02:14:42.347 --> 02:14:45.830
and maybe I could get you something to eat or?

02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:47.600
LIAM: I actually do think we should stop a moment

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:50.768
because this is a difficult conversation to have,

02:14:50.768 --> 02:14:52.010
and I wouldn't like for it to be

02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:54.500
inadvertently cut off by some other--

02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:55.450
TALIESIN: Fair.
LIAM: -- problem.

02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:59.255
Devexian,

02:15:01.038 --> 02:15:04.720
it is a very long, long time

02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:08.613
from the event you remember.

02:15:10.417 --> 02:15:12.967
MATT: "So it seems, based on the decay in this chamber.

02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:18.772
"(sighs) Well."

02:15:20.705 --> 02:15:21.873
TRAVIS: What was the experiment?

02:15:24.226 --> 02:15:27.029
(coughing and choking)

02:15:27.029 --> 02:15:27.980
LAURA: Did you swallow your tongue?

02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:29.692
MARISHA: He's stunned by your hotness.

02:15:29.692 --> 02:15:31.080
TRAVIS: (coughing)
MATT: (laughs)

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:31.913
MARISHA: You have to forgive him.

02:15:31.913 --> 02:15:33.010
TALIESIN: We're on an extraordinary mission.

02:15:33.010 --> 02:15:34.897
SAM: Oh yes, Devexian.

02:15:34.897 --> 02:15:37.623
Fjord is not a robot, despite his head.

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:41.843
That's just-- there was an unfortunate.

02:15:43.625 --> 02:15:46.547
TRAVIS: (coughing)

02:15:46.547 --> 02:15:50.690
MATT: "There were--"
(laughter)

02:15:50.690 --> 02:15:51.979
SAM: It's a rough scene.

02:15:51.979 --> 02:15:55.617
TALIESIN: Get it out of your system now.

02:15:55.617 --> 02:15:59.430
MATT: "There were means of protecting Aeor

02:16:01.497 --> 02:16:02.677
"from the divine destruction

02:16:02.677 --> 02:16:04.993
"that was raining upon and sundering Exandria.

02:16:07.607 --> 02:16:12.607
"One such experiment we assume was considered

02:16:12.757 --> 02:16:16.683
"too dangerous to be allowed,

02:16:18.647 --> 02:16:21.564
"and as such, the city was struck."

02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:24.770
LAURA: Wow!
MARISHA: Whoa, what

02:16:24.770 --> 02:16:25.900
was the experiment?

02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:29.220
It seems like you guys had a few kicking, so--

02:16:29.220 --> 02:16:30.367
TALIESIN: Not the regeneration.

02:16:30.367 --> 02:16:32.810
MATT: "Oh, there were a number of experiments."

02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:35.340
MARISHA: Right, so which one are we talking about?

02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:38.890
Is it this Hammer of Creation

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.640
that Caleb totally mentioned to me?

02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:43.150
LIAM: Yeah, I broke it down for you.

02:16:44.890 --> 02:16:48.443
MATT: He corrects the pronunciation, "The Factorum Malleus.

02:16:49.897 --> 02:16:53.927
"It's not the Hammer of Creation, it's the Creator Hammer."

02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:57.208
MARISHA: Oh, the Creator Hammer.

02:16:59.650 --> 02:17:04.650
Oh, like Godsmasher, like

02:17:06.630 --> 02:17:09.316
bonk, bonk, creators?

02:17:09.316 --> 02:17:11.767
MATT: "Well, the hammer was metaphorical."

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:16.293
MARISHA: Sure, I gathered.
MATT: "But as you can see,

02:17:19.027 --> 02:17:21.285
"such interests come with their own folly,

02:17:21.285 --> 02:17:26.077
"and it seems we were outdone."

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:33.170
LIAM: There is no one like you where we are from,

02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:35.773
or when we are from.

02:17:37.905 --> 02:17:39.573
Will you forgive me,

02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:43.533
made?

02:17:46.407 --> 02:17:49.197
MATT: "The process of creation is different between

02:17:49.197 --> 02:17:53.707
"purely organic creatures and those of artifice,

02:17:53.707 --> 02:17:58.707
"but much like two of you might create a child,

02:17:58.987 --> 02:18:03.873
"I was indeed created, but through intellect,

02:18:05.247 --> 02:18:07.530
"through power."
SAM: The same way

02:18:07.530 --> 02:18:09.657
someone creates a child?

02:18:09.657 --> 02:18:10.848
MATT: "The processes are different."

02:18:10.848 --> 02:18:11.924
SAM: Okay.

02:18:13.707 --> 02:18:18.673
LIAM: Well, as you can see here, Aeor's time has passed.

02:18:19.907 --> 02:18:20.740
MATT: "Indeed."

02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:24.193
LIAM: This is a new era,

02:18:26.250 --> 02:18:30.841
but not all of your fellow citizens are still asleep.

02:18:30.841 --> 02:18:34.099
but not all of your fellow citizens are still asleep.

02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:41.020
What can you tell us about the Somnovem?

02:18:43.837 --> 02:18:47.247
MATT: "They are a

02:18:47.247 --> 02:18:50.997
"cabal of

02:18:50.997 --> 02:18:54.760
"theorists and

02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:59.287
"odd, exploratory,

02:18:59.287 --> 02:19:01.927
"metaphysically-obsessed buffoons."

02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:04.990
LAURA: Have you heard of the Eyes of Nine?

02:19:06.017 --> 02:19:09.517
MATT: "I do not believe I have."
TALIESIN: The Nonagon?

02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:14.854
MATT: "Well, there were the nine of the Somnovem

02:19:14.854 --> 02:19:16.353
"if we're on the same track.

02:19:19.545 --> 02:19:20.870
"Nonagon, I do not."

02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:24.603
LIAM: We are a great many centuries past your time,

02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:30.110
and from the best that we can tell, your

02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:37.027
outsiders are about to turn their theory into a reality.

02:19:39.631 --> 02:19:44.013
Part of your city still exists, we believe, somewhere else

02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:48.872
and is on the verge of being returned.

02:19:52.847 --> 02:19:57.847
MATT: "Well, and this portion would be?"

02:19:59.010 --> 02:20:01.102
LIAM: The Cognouza District.

02:20:01.102 --> 02:20:03.913
MATT: "(laughs)"
LAURA: In the Astral Plane, the Astral Sea.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.913
LIAM: Is any of this familiar to you or does it make sense?

02:20:09.847 --> 02:20:10.757
MATT: "To be honest, no.

02:20:10.757 --> 02:20:14.405
"If Cognouza is what remains of Aeor,

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:17.877
"that in itself is a very cruel joke of history."

02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:24.000
MARISHA: Is it because they were outcasts?

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.610
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I would love to hear about it,

02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:27.250
but aren't we fucking chasing people?

02:20:27.250 --> 02:20:28.575
LAURA: Yeah, we're like seriously--

02:20:28.575 --> 02:20:31.327
MARISHA: I would love to walk and
talk, but he wanted to stop.

02:20:31.327 --> 02:20:33.329
LIAM: Is he okay? Are you okay?

02:20:33.329 --> 02:20:35.970
MARISHA: He looks great. He was just repaired.

02:20:35.970 --> 02:20:38.300
SAM: He's fine.
MATT: "Indeed."

02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:42.380
TALIESIN: Well, let's just put
this straight out there, then.

02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:44.300
Something terrible is going to happen,

02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:47.040
and everything that this city fought against

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:50.280
to save it is about to reignite,

02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:52.190
destroying everything that's been rebuilt

02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:54.540
over a very long time.

02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:56.320
We need help, and we need someone

02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:59.160
who used to know this place.

02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:00.690
MARISHA: Are you in?

02:21:00.690 --> 02:21:03.630
MATT: "I'm welcome to answer a few questions, but."

02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:06.700
MARISHA: Okay, can you answer them while we walk and talk?

02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.260
LAURA: We're seriously on a time crunch.

02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:10.280
I think they're trying to bring the Cognouza Ward

02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.630
back right now from the Astral Sea.

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.573
It's really bad.

02:21:14.573 --> 02:21:15.790
MARISHA: It's corrupt.
LAURA: Really, really bad.

02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:18.240
TRAVIS: Maybe you can help us
figure out where they're going.

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:19.840
They have two threshold crests.

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:22.450
They're going to somewhere deep within this area,

02:21:22.450 --> 02:21:24.110
and they're trying to, as they said,

02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:25.337
bring part of the city back.

02:21:25.337 --> 02:21:27.727
MATT: "Threshold crests deep within this area.

02:21:27.727 --> 02:21:32.727
"Astral Sea, you said?

02:21:34.077 --> 02:21:36.820
"B-9."
MARISHA: B-9?

02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:37.653
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

02:21:37.653 --> 02:21:39.385
MATT: "Is where the planar tethers are centered

02:21:39.385 --> 02:21:41.280
"around the Immensus Gate."

02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:43.133
LAURA: Great.
SAM: Immensus Gate?

02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:46.900
LAURA: Do you have a quick way of getting there,

02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:48.013
a shortcut, maybe?

02:21:49.277 --> 02:21:53.217
MATT: "I would say the (chuckles)

02:21:53.217 --> 02:21:54.830
"the brume elevator, but,"

02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:56.980
and he points out towards the expansive destruction

02:21:56.980 --> 02:22:00.697
and goes, "It seems

02:22:00.697 --> 02:22:02.350
"it no longer exists."

02:22:02.350 --> 02:22:04.670
TRAVIS: And this is a definitely a hands-on operation.

02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:07.780
Not to be too forward, but yes,

02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:10.680
do you have any offensive or defensive capabilities?

02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:13.803
TALIESIN: Or knowledge of where we can find anything?

02:22:15.167 --> 02:22:18.262
MATT: "Most of my knowledge of this place,

02:22:18.262 --> 02:22:22.907
"this city as you've said, is from long, long ago,

02:22:22.907 --> 02:22:27.653
"and the ruin and chaos here, I cannot offer any assurances.

02:22:29.177 --> 02:22:31.397
"I imagine there are things to scavenge.

02:22:31.397 --> 02:22:32.630
"You just need to find them."

02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:34.390
MARISHA: I guess we just mainly want to know

02:22:34.390 --> 02:22:35.980
if you're going to kill us along the way.

02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:38.337
Are you going to kill us, or can you just come with us?

02:22:38.337 --> 02:22:39.377
MATT: "I have no quarrel with you,

02:22:39.377 --> 02:22:42.467
"but I have no interest in following the same path, either.

02:22:42.467 --> 02:22:44.367
"I need to find my associates and see

02:22:44.367 --> 02:22:47.980
"if I can scavenge anymore of, well."

02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:49.550
TALIESIN: Well, you've got about 24 hours.

02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:52.417
If we fail, it's probably 24 hours before this place

02:22:52.417 --> 02:22:54.764
is a new crater, so.
MATT: "Well, good.

02:22:54.764 --> 02:22:57.490
"That'll give me time to put my affairs in order, then."

02:22:57.490 --> 02:22:59.660
TALIESIN: Do you know what this is, by the way?

02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:02.510
I'm miming a bracelet again just in case it wasn't clear.

02:23:04.147 --> 02:23:08.190
MATT: "That would be a security bracelet, yes."

02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:09.023
TALIESIN: Good to know.
TRAVIS: Do we need that

02:23:09.023 --> 02:23:11.807
on the way to B-9?
MATT: "It's possible.

02:23:11.807 --> 02:23:14.247
"It is utilized to bypass some of the various sensors

02:23:14.247 --> 02:23:17.707
"and-or bypass various locks and seals

02:23:17.707 --> 02:23:21.290
"within certain chambers."
TALIESIN: Things like that door?

02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:24.017
MATT: "Possibly. That door is heavily sealed.

02:23:24.017 --> 02:23:26.600
"If not itself, other things like it perhaps."

02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:28.217
TALIESIN: And you wouldn't know what's--

02:23:28.217 --> 02:23:29.547
MATT: "I can attempt to open it,

02:23:29.547 --> 02:23:33.090
"but it is more of a radial opening."

02:23:33.090 --> 02:23:35.380
LAURA: We should probably just go back to the thing

02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:36.835
and drop down to nine.

02:23:36.835 --> 02:23:38.471
TALIESIN: It's time to go.
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

02:23:38.471 --> 02:23:40.200
I don't think we need to fuck with whatever's

02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:41.630
behind this door.
LAURA: No.

02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:45.140
I don't know why the Tomb Takers would have gone this way,

02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:48.550
but if we know to drop down, maybe we know a faster route.

02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:49.850
We can find it before them.

02:23:49.850 --> 02:23:51.960
MARISHA: We've never seen Lucien fly.

02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:54.580
Even when we were flying above them--

02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:56.030
LAURA: That's true.
MARISHA: -- they could not,

02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:59.040
so it could be our one chance to really gain some ground.

02:23:59.040 --> 02:23:59.873
LAURA: Yeah.

02:23:59.873 --> 02:24:00.864
LIAM: And get the drop on them again.

02:24:00.864 --> 02:24:03.096
LAURA: What is it?

02:24:03.096 --> 02:24:04.682
TALIESIN: You're doing a hand thing.

02:24:04.682 --> 02:24:06.990
MATT: It brings its hand up for a second.

02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:11.180
It focuses, and there is a (energy whooshing)

02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:13.630
a burst of electrical energy,

02:24:13.630 --> 02:24:16.100
not unlike that staticky sensation that you felt

02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:17.780
in the previous chamber where you battled

02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:19.480
those strange abominations.

02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:20.570
The air seems to tingle,

02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:22.340
and some of your hair begins to drift.

02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:24.181
Those who have it, sorry.

02:24:24.181 --> 02:24:25.350
(laughter)

02:24:25.350 --> 02:24:29.460
MATT: Begins to temporarily float and drift in the space,

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:34.460
and as it washes over, you notice that the sealed door,

02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:37.900
there's a (air releasing) sound.

02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:39.150
TALIESIN: Well, since we're here.

02:24:40.217 --> 02:24:41.639
MATT: "Let that be a parting gift."

02:24:41.639 --> 02:24:42.472
SAM: A parting gift?

02:24:42.472 --> 02:24:45.304
MARISHA: You just unlocked something.
SAM: You're just going to leave?

02:24:45.304 --> 02:24:47.750
MATT: "I have interests elsewhere in these ruins."

02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:50.920
SAM: We've told you there's no people alive.

02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:53.680
There's none of your associates who've survived.

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:56.027
LIAM: Many of your fellow Aeorians--

02:24:56.027 --> 02:24:59.588
MATT: "If I recall, you found me not far from my associate."

02:24:59.588 --> 02:25:01.380
MARISHA: He wants to fix more people.

02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:03.719
LAURA: Are you with Brashaar?

02:25:03.719 --> 02:25:04.960
SAM: The one in the bubble?

02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:06.110
LIAM: Yes, there are people

02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:10.953
all over encased in some sort of blue spheres,

02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:13.548
freezing them in time or protecting them.

02:25:13.548 --> 02:25:16.697
We have not been able to ascertain the purpose.

02:25:16.697 --> 02:25:19.733
MATT: "Indeed, that calls to my curiosity as well.

02:25:20.577 --> 02:25:24.067
"I may not be of much help, but if I can manage to locate or

02:25:24.067 --> 02:25:28.135
"discover some means of freeing associates of mine,

02:25:28.135 --> 02:25:31.737
"maybe they can be of aid, if not in time, should you fail,

02:25:31.737 --> 02:25:34.585
"to be a second wave of defense against this."

02:25:34.585 --> 02:25:36.637
LIAM: But you're not familiar with this phenomenon?

02:25:36.637 --> 02:25:37.470
MATT: "I am not.

02:25:37.470 --> 02:25:39.903
"This is entirely beyond my understanding."

02:25:39.903 --> 02:25:42.400
LAURA: When we get to B-9, is there anything we should be

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:43.880
on the lookout for that will let us know

02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:45.800
we're on the right path?

02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:47.153
TRAVIS: Defenses, traps?

02:25:48.327 --> 02:25:49.687
MATT: "Defenses, most definitely.

02:25:49.687 --> 02:25:51.330
"There are a number of arcane--

02:25:54.107 --> 02:25:58.627
"Keep a keen eye out for any sort of deeply-set grooves,

02:25:58.627 --> 02:26:02.293
"any sort of strange language along the floors and doorways.

02:26:03.667 --> 02:26:07.063
"The gate itself has an intricate pattern for initiation.

02:26:07.927 --> 02:26:10.857
"If you intend to utilize this gate,

02:26:10.857 --> 02:26:15.094
"ensure that you have the most trained eyes upon it."

02:26:15.094 --> 02:26:16.761
MARISHA: Initiation.
LAURA: Okay.

02:26:19.596 --> 02:26:20.988
MARISHA: Trained eyes.

02:26:20.988 --> 02:26:23.170
TRAVIS: What was it called, the tethers?

02:26:23.170 --> 02:26:24.228
LAURA: Yeah, the tethers.

02:26:24.228 --> 02:26:25.450
MATT: "Planar tethers."
TRAVIS: Planar tethers, thank you.

02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:26.840
LAURA: And the immense gate?

02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:28.430
MATT and SAM: The Immensus Gate.

02:26:29.747 --> 02:26:32.507
MATT: "It's one of the larger waypoints between the planes,

02:26:32.507 --> 02:26:36.622
"rooted here in the city, if it still stands."

02:26:36.622 --> 02:26:38.416
TRAVIS: They're counting on it.

02:26:38.416 --> 02:26:39.249
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:41.430
TRAVIS: Well, I would wish you luck,

02:26:41.430 --> 02:26:44.603
but you seem to be quite the sharp mind.

02:26:45.727 --> 02:26:47.252
TALIESIN: Hope for our sakes that we see you again.

02:26:47.252 --> 02:26:48.240
MARISHA: Behind this door,

02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:49.840
you said was a gift?

02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:53.490
Nothing that's going to try and smash us to pieces?

02:26:53.490 --> 02:26:56.183
TRAVIS: I go inside the room.
MATT: "I have no idea.

02:26:57.137 --> 02:26:59.097
"You requested my assistance, and I sealed it.

02:26:59.097 --> 02:27:01.937
"It's up to you whether or not you wish to inspect it, but

02:27:04.117 --> 02:27:05.797
"I do thank you for your assistance.

02:27:05.797 --> 02:27:08.542
"Consider this a gesture of gratitude."

02:27:08.542 --> 02:27:12.543
SAM: Devexian-- I guess Vex for short--

02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:19.297
I know we only just met, but I won't ever forget you,

02:27:20.450 --> 02:27:24.213
and I know with confidence that you'll never forget me,

02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:26.843
and there's some comfort in that.

02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:29.801
LAURA: (whispering) She's horny.

02:27:31.497 --> 02:27:33.397
MATT: "I gathered.

02:27:33.397 --> 02:27:36.337
"Thank you, and good luck."
(laughter)

02:27:36.337 --> 02:27:40.538
MATT: "May you survive these trying times."

02:27:40.538 --> 02:27:43.650
(laughter)

02:27:43.650 --> 02:27:46.853
MATT: Turns with a confused cock of the head,

02:27:48.370 --> 02:27:51.420
and then just briskly begins to exit with confidence

02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:53.480
back towards the hallway that you entered from,

02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.183
very like an entity with a plan.

02:27:58.600 --> 02:27:59.758
Unexpected switch.

02:27:59.758 --> 02:28:00.680
LIAM: Super soldier.

02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:02.568
TRAVIS: In an uncomfortable way.
LAURA: You woke up Vision.

02:28:02.568 --> 02:28:03.650
TRAVIS: We go inside the room.

02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:04.950
MARISHA: Yeah, what's behind this door?

02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:07.810
TALIESIN: Very slowly, yeah, take a peek into the room.

02:28:07.810 --> 02:28:09.972
MARISHA: If it's rejuvenation, hopefully it's a--
TRAVIS: Slowly?

02:28:09.972 --> 02:28:11.730
TRAVIS: In!
TALIESIN: I'm--

02:28:11.730 --> 02:28:13.640
TRAVIS: Steve Rogers just opened up a door with his hand.

02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:14.548
I'm going in.

02:28:14.548 --> 02:28:15.381
MATT: Okay.

02:28:16.530 --> 02:28:18.100
Heading inside the chamber,

02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:21.540
you can see what looks to be a

02:28:22.770 --> 02:28:27.010
somewhat square, rectangular shape about 30 feet back

02:28:27.010 --> 02:28:29.110
and about 40 feet wide.

02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:33.080
There are two odd platforms in the center-back of it

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:35.980
that are encased in a cylindrical glass,

02:28:35.980 --> 02:28:37.700
not unlike the ones in the previous chambers,

02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:38.673
if a bit smaller.

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.410
They're about three feet wide with a thick casing around it.

02:28:43.410 --> 02:28:45.720
So while they were about five feet from side to side,

02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:48.920
it's almost a foot of glass entirely around

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:53.330
these solid cylinders that rise from the top

02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:55.970
of these platforms to about eight to nine feet up

02:28:55.970 --> 02:28:57.370
before joining with some sort of a

02:28:57.370 --> 02:28:59.273
stone interface in the ceiling.

02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:05.600
You can see one of them is heavily cracked in the glass,

02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:08.550
but it's still holding, but you can see like all number

02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:12.393
of heavy spiderweb-type cracks throughout it,

02:29:12.393 --> 02:29:15.201
climbing about six of the eight feet upward.

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:22.160
Throughout the room, there are four Aeorian corpses

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:26.863
along the floor, well-preserved in this sealed chamber.

02:29:28.470 --> 02:29:32.080
The positions in which they currently sit seem less

02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:33.480
that they were thrown about.

02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:37.720
Some of them seem to be clutching here

02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:40.460
or just sleeping in past,

02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:43.830
and based on the heavy element of security

02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:45.263
and sealing of this chamber,

02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.340
those with a high passive investigation

02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:51.730
which would be Beauregard, Caleb, and Veth,

02:29:51.730 --> 02:29:54.850
you gather this room may have been hermetically sealed.

02:29:54.850 --> 02:29:57.513
TRAVIS: Airtight.
MATT: And the contents suffocated.

02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:04.000
Three of the bodies are dressed in similar

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.930
uniform outfits you see with some variation

02:30:06.930 --> 02:30:08.760
amongst a lot of the corpses that you've encountered

02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:13.310
in these lower levels, one of which is dressed in more

02:30:13.310 --> 02:30:15.220
combat-ready attire.

02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:20.030
You can see a unique, sleek-looking chest plate

02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:25.030
that has some sort of soft sigils along some of the plates,

02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:27.290
some points towards the shoulders.

02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:31.470
It looks like a fairly well-made piece

02:30:31.470 --> 02:30:34.830
of defensive equipment and an odd weapon

02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:35.904
that sits at their side.

02:30:35.904 --> 02:30:37.307
LAURA: Ooh!

02:30:37.307 --> 02:30:38.140
MARISHA: Are we gathering--

02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:39.548
LAURA: Loot the bodies!

02:30:39.548 --> 02:30:40.439
MARISHA: Yeah, loot the bodies.

02:30:40.439 --> 02:30:43.945
Is this any indication that this is Athodan's?

02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:47.198
MATT: There is writing at the base

02:30:47.198 --> 02:30:50.186
of each of these glass tubes.

02:30:50.186 --> 02:30:52.310
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck, we just lost our translator.

02:30:52.310 --> 02:30:55.100
TALIESIN: I've got a secondary option.

02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:57.109
LIAM: I can read it.
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

02:30:57.109 --> 02:30:59.707
You cast Tongues not long ago.

02:30:59.707 --> 02:31:00.540
MATT: Okay, so you--?

02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:02.090
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I'll cast Comprehend Languages.

02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:03.930
MATT: Okay, it's a ritual, right?

02:31:03.930 --> 02:31:05.100
LIAM: No, I have it prepared.

02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:06.180
MATT: Oh.
LIAM: I'm just doing it.

02:31:06.180 --> 02:31:08.370
MATT: Okay, fair enough.
LIAM: We're in a rush.

02:31:08.370 --> 02:31:09.203
MATT: Fair enough.

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:14.968
The two glass cases,

02:31:14.968 --> 02:31:16.857
these texts beneath them reads:

02:31:16.857 --> 02:31:21.857
Terminal RE 01, Terminal RE 02,

02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:24.983
and there is a purple crystal affixed to the base of each.

02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:27.570
LIAM: Same color as the bracelet?

02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:30.710
MATT: Could be.
LIAM: Okay.

02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:32.309
MARISHA: A purple thing?

02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:34.660
MATT: Essek, as you are going through the chamber

02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:36.710
and preparing your spell, Essek's going,

02:31:39.105 --> 02:31:41.770
(sighs) "There's something odd about this room."

02:31:41.770 --> 02:31:42.603
LAURA: What is it?

02:31:46.302 --> 02:31:48.375
MATT: "It's hard to explain.

02:31:50.217 --> 02:31:54.187
"It's like a... like a flavor in the air

02:31:54.187 --> 02:31:57.063
"or a scent that's familiar."

02:31:57.063 --> 02:31:58.438
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave.

02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:01.560
MATT: You sense nothing.

02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:04.900
MARISHA: Which is the cracked one, terminal one?

02:32:04.900 --> 02:32:05.860
MATT: Terminal two is the cracked one.

02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:07.970
MARISHA: Terminal two is cracked.

02:32:07.970 --> 02:32:10.180
LIAM: Would--
TALIESIN: We can talk to any of these--

02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:12.820
LIAM: -- Caleb or Veth, with all
their experience with chemicals

02:32:12.820 --> 02:32:15.790
and components recognize the smell?

02:32:15.790 --> 02:32:18.570
MATT: It's not a smell, it's not a taste.

02:32:18.570 --> 02:32:21.390
Make a perception check, Caleb.

02:32:21.390 --> 02:32:23.870
LIAM: Ozone?

02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:25.370
Perception, you say?
MATT: Yes.

02:32:26.700 --> 02:32:29.508
LIAM: That is a 19.
MATT: A 19?

02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:35.120
You begin to catch some of it, too.

02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:37.810
It's something oddly familiar, so subtle,

02:32:37.810 --> 02:32:41.981
and as far as a sensory contact to it, it's--

02:32:43.125 --> 02:32:46.620
it's almost extra-sensory, and you can't quite place it

02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:49.177
until Essek makes eye contact with you and goes,

02:32:50.797 --> 02:32:52.471
"Dunamis.

02:32:56.427 --> 02:32:58.669
"This chamber has dunamis."

02:32:59.678 --> 02:33:02.840
LIAM: Well, that's interesting.
MATT: "Indeed."

02:33:10.370 --> 02:33:13.287
TALIESIN: I think it's worth having
a conversation with one of these

02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:16.291
people.

02:33:16.291 --> 02:33:17.760
MARISHA: Why?

02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:19.785
TALIESIN: You can find out what this is real quick,

02:33:21.726 --> 02:33:23.142
be on our way.

02:33:24.270 --> 02:33:26.486
MARISHA: Is there still fluid or something in the chambers,

02:33:26.486 --> 02:33:27.927
anything that looks leaked out?

02:33:27.927 --> 02:33:29.750
LAURA: Anything floating?
MARISHA: What's in the tubes?

02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:32.950
MATT: They look completely clear, empty.

02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:35.620
TRAVIS: When you two say "dunamis," <i>I</i> know what it means,

02:33:35.620 --> 02:33:38.595
but just so <i>Veth</i> is in the clear,

02:33:38.595 --> 02:33:40.828
you mean traces of dunamancy?
SAM: Wha--? What?

02:33:40.828 --> 02:33:43.050
MATT: "Yes."
LAURA: Like time magic,

02:33:43.050 --> 02:33:45.397
gravity magic?
MATT: "Possibly.

02:33:45.397 --> 02:33:48.377
"It is specific to the pursuit of dunamancy,

02:33:48.377 --> 02:33:52.477
"to the crafting of that sort of arcana,

02:33:52.477 --> 02:33:53.935
"and it is very specific to the Dynasty and their research."

02:33:53.935 --> 02:33:58.585
"and it is very specific to the Dynasty and their research."

02:33:58.585 --> 02:34:03.114
LAURA: Ooh, this could be where it originated from.

02:34:03.114 --> 02:34:04.597
MATT: "Heh.

02:34:04.597 --> 02:34:07.881
"That would be interesting and a dangerous thought

02:34:07.881 --> 02:34:11.210
"to the Dynasty as well."

02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:13.740
MARISHA: Is there anything that looks fucked up,

02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:16.198
like it could have been fucked up from, like,

02:34:16.198 --> 02:34:17.796
dunamancy magic?
LAURA: (Valley girl accent) Does anything look

02:34:17.796 --> 02:34:19.121
fucked up?
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:34:19.121 --> 02:34:20.179
(laughter)

02:34:20.179 --> 02:34:22.921
MATT: (Valley girl accent) I mean, this whole city
looks pretty fucked up, I don't know.

02:34:22.921 --> 02:34:25.249
MARISHA: This place is kind of busted, you guys.

02:34:25.249 --> 02:34:27.570
I don't know.

02:34:27.570 --> 02:34:30.390
TALIESIN: I'm kind of curious. I say we go for it.

02:34:30.390 --> 02:34:31.980
LAURA: Talk to the fancy ones.

02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:35.153
TALIESIN: The warrior, I'm going to Speak with Dead.

02:34:35.153 --> 02:34:37.100
LAURA: And then we're going to take all their stuff,

02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:38.408
but we'll do it after he talks to them

02:34:38.408 --> 02:34:42.387
so they don't think that we're, you know.

02:34:42.387 --> 02:34:43.650
MATT: So you go to the corpse.

02:34:43.650 --> 02:34:47.210
You can see it's--
LIAM: Hey, that's my plasma rifle.

02:34:47.210 --> 02:34:51.352
MATT: -- very dried into a leathery, mummified exterior.

02:34:51.352 --> 02:34:52.943
LAURA: Will he be able to understand?

02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:58.606
LIAM: Well, no.
TALIESIN: Oh, is that?

02:35:01.570 --> 02:35:03.400
Shit.
LIAM: Just burn another slot.

02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:05.026
Just burn one.

02:35:06.220 --> 02:35:07.480
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens before.

02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:08.780
MARISHA: We could also always do

02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:10.713
what we did before and take a head.

02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:13.530
TRAVIS: He just cast--
TALIESIN: I just cast it.

02:35:13.530 --> 02:35:15.350
LAURA: Yeah, he already did it.

02:35:15.350 --> 02:35:16.183
TALIESIN: Let's try it.
LIAM: I mean,

02:35:16.183 --> 02:35:17.380
I'll hear what he says.

02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:19.650
They speak audibly, right?

02:35:19.650 --> 02:35:22.230
SAM: Yeah, but he would--
MATT: I've interpreted it as such.

02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:26.630
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Right.

02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:31.160
TALIESIN: If you can answer in Common,

02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:33.923
who were you in this place?

02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:39.210
MATT: The head, which currently rests against the wall

02:35:39.210 --> 02:35:42.360
in the back of the armor, leans forward,

02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:46.370
and this horrible, dry, sucking sound catches its throat

02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:50.400
as its chest cavity pulls in air for the first time

02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:52.960
in over 1,000 years.

02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:55.420
The jaw, still open, unflapping.

02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:59.433
You just hear this hoarse whisper come out of it.

02:36:00.511 --> 02:36:05.511
"(whispers inaudibly)" You cannot understand it,

02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:09.773
but you, if you have Tongues available?

02:36:11.050 --> 02:36:14.190
LIAM: Oh, no, well, I have it
available, but I didn't cast it.

02:36:14.190 --> 02:36:15.900
MATT: Yeah, so then--
LIAM: It's already been spoken,

02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:16.850
so whatever he said, I've missed.

02:36:16.850 --> 02:36:17.690
MATT: Whatever he said, you missed.

02:36:17.690 --> 02:36:20.263
MARISHA: Can I quickly write because,

02:36:20.263 --> 02:36:23.173
like can I quickly just jot down the phonetics?

02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:25.131
MATT: You can.

02:36:25.131 --> 02:36:27.317
Wait, do you have a monk ability that lets you?

02:36:27.317 --> 02:36:29.210
MARISHA: I can, oh, you're right.

02:36:29.210 --> 02:36:33.373
I can understand spoken words.

02:36:33.373 --> 02:36:36.863
LAURA: Oh, great!
MARISHA: But I can't read them.

02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:42.128
But, yeah, Tongue of the Sun and Moon.

02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:45.490
MATT: So oddly, as you're in
the process of like jotting down

02:36:45.490 --> 02:36:47.550
in your notebook, you listen to it and go--

02:36:47.550 --> 02:36:49.040
LIAM: Pushups y'all, they work.

02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:51.600
MATT: Huh, you can understand this guy a little bit.

02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:53.640
You're following it strangely.

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:56.940
You miss the name, but this,

02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:58.840
you gather that this individual is saying

02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:02.960
that they were security personnel for the project.

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:04.533
MARISHA: Security for the project.

02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:06.943
TALIESIN: What did this machine do?

02:37:08.445 --> 02:37:12.511
MATT: "(hoarse whispering)"

02:37:12.511 --> 02:37:14.820
You pick up to mean

02:37:14.820 --> 02:37:19.040
it was an attempt

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:23.740
to condense

02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:26.163
near-instantaneous rejuvenation.

02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:30.890
MARISHA: They were trying to make rejuvenation juice

02:37:30.890 --> 02:37:32.253
near-instantaneous.

02:37:33.999 --> 02:37:35.700
LAURA: (gasps)
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:36.850
TALIESIN: Were they successful?

02:37:39.852 --> 02:37:41.752
MATT: "(hoarse whispering)"

02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:43.170
Mostly.

02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:46.100
MARISHA: Mostly.

02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:48.450
TALIESIN: Where did they keep the fruits of this labor?

02:37:49.902 --> 02:37:53.135
MATT: "(hoarse whispering)"

02:37:53.135 --> 02:37:54.743
You're looking at them.

02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:00.023
TALIESIN: How do you use it?

02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:04.961
MATT: ("hoarse whispering)"

02:38:04.961 --> 02:38:07.003
You require the proper clearance.

02:38:08.850 --> 02:38:12.020
At that point, the head's already just. (gasps)

02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:14.780
MARISHA: Let's hope that that person had clearance.

02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:18.333
If not, maybe there's something on this fancy body.

02:38:19.297 --> 02:38:20.250
SAM: Oh yeah, let's loot!

02:38:20.250 --> 02:38:21.500
TRAVIS: What's this weapon?

02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:23.500
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: What's it look like?

02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:25.916
MATT: If you look at it, it is a--

02:38:25.916 --> 02:38:27.360
it looks like a crossbow,

02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:29.160
and it has the same like bow front to it.

02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:30.910
It is made from a darkened,

02:38:30.910 --> 02:38:33.990
like a slate-steel, metal look to it

02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:37.490
with interesting runes that are put across the entire bow.

02:38:37.490 --> 02:38:40.480
There's no string, and the bow is not curved

02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:41.780
more than it is slightly angled,

02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:43.370
and you can see the runes across the bow

02:38:43.370 --> 02:38:45.090
that get wider and wider towards the base,

02:38:45.090 --> 02:38:47.130
and there are these two disks at the end.

02:38:47.130 --> 02:38:49.170
You can see the slot where a bolt goes into it,

02:38:49.170 --> 02:38:50.793
and it just looks very sleek.

02:38:51.744 --> 02:38:55.240
TRAVIS: I don't want to assume, but would you like to?

02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:57.230
SAM: Is it a large crossbow, or?

02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:59.001
MATT: It is a hand crossbow.

02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:01.153
SAM: All right.

02:39:02.293 --> 02:39:05.570
I'll take out one of my doo-hickeys

02:39:05.570 --> 02:39:07.700
and put it up there, one of my bolts,

02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:10.380
and there's no string?
MATT: There's no string.

02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:11.630
There's nowhere that you reach for.

02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:12.740
There's nowhere to cock it back,

02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:14.314
and you just place the bolt into it,

02:39:14.314 --> 02:39:16.998
and it seems like it's almost flimsy. It should fall out.

02:39:16.998 --> 02:39:17.831
SAM: Okay.

02:39:17.831 --> 02:39:22.030
I will aim it at that dead body we just talked to,

02:39:22.030 --> 02:39:24.500
and is there a trigger?

02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:27.616
MATT: There is a place where the finger gets pressed.

02:39:27.616 --> 02:39:29.460
SAM: Okay, I'll do that.

02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:30.470
MATT: Okay, you place it there,

02:39:30.470 --> 02:39:32.900
and you feel it warm up to your touch,

02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:36.250
and it's almost at the ready.

02:39:36.250 --> 02:39:38.120
You guys watch as the runes along the bow

02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:41.260
light up and give off this like

02:39:41.260 --> 02:39:43.040
soft, orange-ish red glow--

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:44.064
TRAVIS: I'm just going to back out of the room.

02:39:44.064 --> 02:39:45.008
I'm just going to back out of the room.

02:39:45.008 --> 02:39:47.085
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Hey wait!

02:39:47.085 --> 02:39:49.275
Don't shoot them before we loot the bodies!

02:39:49.275 --> 02:39:50.828
SAM: But it's not going to explode or--

02:39:50.828 --> 02:39:52.890
LAURA: You don't know that!

02:39:52.890 --> 02:39:54.530
SAM: Okay, loot.
MARISHA: Says the woman

02:39:54.530 --> 02:39:57.310
who killed Caduceus with an exploding arrow.

02:39:57.310 --> 02:39:58.260
LAURA: I take the stuff.

02:39:58.260 --> 02:40:00.900
I'm looking for keys or any kind of cards

02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:03.691
or any more bracelets

02:40:03.691 --> 02:40:06.266
to, like, be cards to open things.

02:40:06.266 --> 02:40:08.060
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:12.310
LAURA: I'm aiding Beau because
you said she was doing it, too.

02:40:12.310 --> 02:40:14.050
SAM: She did?
MARISHA: Sure, yep.

02:40:14.050 --> 02:40:15.270
LAURA: Didn't you, you said you were--

02:40:15.270 --> 02:40:18.270
MARISHA: I did say loot the bodies.
(laughter)

02:40:18.270 --> 02:40:20.181
MATT: Make an investigation check, Jester.
TRAVIS: She did?

02:40:20.181 --> 02:40:22.564
(laughter)
I didn't hear that!

02:40:22.564 --> 02:40:23.650
LAURA: Aw, come on!

02:40:23.650 --> 02:40:26.360
It went 19, three.

02:40:27.702 --> 02:40:28.597
Eight.

02:40:30.992 --> 02:40:33.470
MATT: I mean, the armor on the dude's pretty plain.

02:40:33.470 --> 02:40:35.580
That's definitely easy to scavenge.

02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:38.988
As you nervously pull it from the corpses,

02:40:38.988 --> 02:40:42.155
Veth is just holding this thing, (powering up)! (laughs)

02:40:42.155 --> 02:40:42.988
SAM: I'm going to shoot!

02:40:42.988 --> 02:40:44.360
TRAVIS: It's like that little handgun in Halo,

02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:47.127
when you hold it.
LAURA: Nobody has any keys,

02:40:47.127 --> 02:40:49.671
key cards, any fucking thing like that.

02:40:49.671 --> 02:40:52.871
MARISHA: Let's hope the body doesn't explode, look out!

02:40:52.871 --> 02:40:54.296
SAM: (bolt firing)
MATT: Okay.

02:40:54.296 --> 02:40:57.320
With your finger on that strange, little lever there

02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.030
as you press in, it, like a hair-trigger,

02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:02.990
just pulls in before shutting in,

02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:07.987
and all the rows of runes flash, and

02:41:09.210 --> 02:41:12.930
like a rail gun, gravity just pulls it forward,

02:41:12.930 --> 02:41:15.570
like it just gets yanked in a forward motion,

02:41:15.570 --> 02:41:19.226
and it impacts the corpse with a heavy (impact).

02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:22.600
MARISHA: Well, maybe that's your dunamancy.

02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:24.460
SAM: Cool!

02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:28.683
No string, no kickback, wow!

02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:31.415
Any explosion?

02:41:31.415 --> 02:41:33.160
MATT: No explosion.

02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:35.476
TALIESIN: It's pretty cool.
TRAVIS: Bee bee bee boo, (explosion)!

02:41:35.476 --> 02:41:37.790
(laughter)

02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:41.570
MATT: You do sense, where the finger trigger is,

02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:42.870
as you're looking at it over,

02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:46.572
there is a secondary lever on the handle.

02:41:46.572 --> 02:41:48.140
SAM: Ooh, a grenade launcher?

02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:51.240
MARISHA: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Maybe not in here though.

02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:53.700
MARISHA: Hang on, now let me pat down the body.

02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:54.533
SAM: Yeah, sure.

02:41:54.533 --> 02:41:56.190
MARISHA: Now, can I do an investigation check?

02:41:56.190 --> 02:41:57.065
MATT: Sure, this is--

02:41:57.065 --> 02:41:59.680
SAM: I'm going to retrieve my bolt.

02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:01.500
LAURA: And we're looking for something

02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:04.068
so we can get the rejuvenation liquid?

02:42:04.068 --> 02:42:06.590
MARISHA: Oh dude, I keep biffing these.

02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:09.380
This is bad, 17.

02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:10.900
TALIESIN: I gave you a d4, by the way.

02:42:10.900 --> 02:42:12.626
MARISHA: You did, you blessed me?
TALIESIN: I did bless you.

02:42:12.626 --> 02:42:13.550
MARISHA: All right, all right, Guidance.

02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:14.997
LAURA: He Guidanced you.

02:42:16.172 --> 02:42:17.950
MARISHA: Aw, 18.

02:42:17.950 --> 02:42:19.128
I rolled a five.
LAURA: Better than my--

02:42:19.128 --> 02:42:20.540
TRAVIS: Come on, Biff.
MARISHA: It's better, it's better.

02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:23.200
MATT: You go rummaging through the body as best you can.

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.111
You do find on one of them,

02:42:25.111 --> 02:42:28.053
there was another similar bracelet
that matches the one that Caduceus had found,

02:42:28.053 --> 02:42:30.211
but this one has a turquoise-colored gem.

02:42:30.211 --> 02:42:32.010
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Ooh!

02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:33.630
TRAVIS: Getting a collection going!

02:42:33.630 --> 02:42:34.463
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:42:34.463 --> 02:42:36.060
LAURA: Ooh, that one matches your outfit.

02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:37.160
You should wear the turquoise one.

02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:39.830
MARISHA: Hmm, it does! Look at that!
TALIESIN: All right, let's see if we can do this

02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:41.150
and head on our way.

02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:42.930
This seems like a good thing to have.

02:42:42.930 --> 02:42:45.470
MARISHA: Well, do we want to get some rejuvenation juice?

02:42:45.470 --> 02:42:48.141
TALIESIN: Let's see if this ID works.

02:42:48.141 --> 02:42:53.141
MARISHA: Is there any type of beep-beep, retina scan,

02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:54.987
key card access?

02:42:54.987 --> 02:42:58.129
MATT: At the base of each of these two devices, you do see

02:42:58.129 --> 02:43:03.129
what looks to be a small purple gem inlaid.

02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:05.328
TALIESIN: Oh, well maybe--
MARISHA: It feels like the purple!

02:43:05.328 --> 02:43:08.510
Yeah Rick, I think-- okay, okay.

02:43:08.510 --> 02:43:10.980
MATT: Which one do you place it in front of?

02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:13.080
LIAM: RE 01 or RE 02?

02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:15.877
MARISHA: Two is busted, so try.

02:43:15.877 --> 02:43:16.970
TALIESIN: RE 01?
MARISHA: Try one.

02:43:16.970 --> 02:43:18.610
TALIESIN: I will try one.
MATT: Okay.

02:43:18.610 --> 02:43:21.336
You pull it across, and you hear it (powering up)

02:43:21.336 --> 02:43:23.698
and the glass opens up.

02:43:26.090 --> 02:43:28.120
There's a, previously where you did not see,

02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:31.580
there is a slight line, and a glass door inverts,

02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:33.950
and then slides to the side, and the tube is open.

02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:35.810
TALIESIN: What's inside?
MATT: Nothing.

02:43:35.810 --> 02:43:36.800
It is--
LAURA: Ooh,

02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:39.981
I bet you have to step inside of it and Luke Skywalker it.

02:43:40.846 --> 02:43:43.050
TRAVIS: How big? Person size?
LAURA: Float in the juice.

02:43:43.050 --> 02:43:45.890
MATT: It's about three feet across on the interior.

02:43:45.890 --> 02:43:48.040
TRAVIS: Gimme my hair back.

02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:52.160
SAM: Oh no, Fjord, what if it turns you into something else?

02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:54.370
ASHLEY: Do it.
LIAM: Fills with acid.

02:43:54.370 --> 02:43:56.336
TALIESIN: I think--
MARISHA: Do we have to close from the outside?

02:43:56.336 --> 02:43:57.256
MATT: Did you step inside?

02:43:57.256 --> 02:43:58.171
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: He did.

02:43:58.171 --> 02:44:01.258
MATT: (whooshing) It closes.
SAM: Oh god!

02:44:01.258 --> 02:44:02.091
TALIESIN: What are you doing?

02:44:02.091 --> 02:44:04.350
MATT: The gem-- (energy flares)

02:44:04.350 --> 02:44:05.500
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:06.991
SAM: What if he steps out and he's like,

02:44:06.991 --> 02:44:08.969
(low-pitched) "My name is Devexian."

02:44:08.969 --> 02:44:10.294
TRAVIS: That would be bad.

02:44:10.294 --> 02:44:13.558
MATT: And as the gem is flashing, Essek goes,

02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:17.570
"Right there, there's-- I can sense it."

02:44:17.570 --> 02:44:19.302
TRAVIS: What are you pointing at?

02:44:19.302 --> 02:44:20.738
(muffled) What are you pointing at?

02:44:20.738 --> 02:44:21.571
MATT: You can't hear anything.

02:44:21.571 --> 02:44:24.024
He's just-- it is locked in silence.

02:44:24.024 --> 02:44:26.402
SAM: He's in one of those money tubes.
LAURA: Fjord!

02:44:26.402 --> 02:44:27.801
On the old game shows.
LAURA: I love you.

02:44:27.801 --> 02:44:28.634
TRAVIS: I know.

02:44:28.634 --> 02:44:31.202
MATT: Oh god, this is some Spock shit, no.

02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:34.260
Go ahead and roll a d100 for me, please.

02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:36.460
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm real good with those.

02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:39.670
SAM: Oh shit.
MARISHA: Butterflies.

02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:41.750
Butterflies!
LAURA: Butterflies, butterflies.

02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:44.670
SAM: Apple tarts.

02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:45.745
TRAVIS: 59.

02:44:45.745 --> 02:44:48.330
MATT: 59, okay.
ASHLEY: Your hair growing back.

02:44:48.330 --> 02:44:52.000
MATT: The little gem begins to glow immensely,

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.250
and you watch as the chamber begins to glow

02:44:54.250 --> 02:44:55.860
with the same purple energy.

02:44:55.860 --> 02:44:57.490
Where once you just saw Fjord standing

02:44:57.490 --> 02:45:00.770
in this translucent glass, suddenly the whole thing lights,

02:45:00.770 --> 02:45:02.490
like it's filled with neon purple light.

02:45:02.490 --> 02:45:05.040
And you just see for a brief moment

02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:08.060
the skeletal outline of Fjord's body,

02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:10.731
like it had just been irradiated to an extent.

02:45:10.731 --> 02:45:12.162
(laughter)

02:45:12.162 --> 02:45:14.020
TALIESIN: Well, the hair ain't coming back now.

02:45:15.355 --> 02:45:18.730
MATT: And (whooshing) the light's gone.

02:45:19.638 --> 02:45:22.223
(powering down) The light begins to diminish.

02:45:23.105 --> 02:45:26.380
TRAVIS: (explosion)
(laughter)

02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:27.530
TALIESIN: I have theories.

02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:30.404
TRAVIS: (screams)
SAM: Splats.

02:45:30.404 --> 02:45:32.596
MATT: It just mists on the inside.

02:45:32.596 --> 02:45:33.429
TRAVIS: Ugh!

02:45:34.662 --> 02:45:35.670
LAURA: No!

02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:37.752
SAM: It's a microwave!

02:45:37.752 --> 02:45:42.610
(laughter)

02:45:42.610 --> 02:45:44.050
MATT: Fjord seems fine.

02:45:44.050 --> 02:45:44.900
LAURA: Is his hair back?

02:45:44.900 --> 02:45:47.060
SAM: Is it closed?
Is it open?

02:45:47.060 --> 02:45:48.230
MATT: It didn't hurt.

02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:53.070
It's odd, you felt this weird warming sensation

02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:57.180
and then everything blurred for an instant.

02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:58.730
And then you're standing there,

02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:02.383
refreshed.

02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:05.743
The door opens.

02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:08.291
Hair's back.

02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:11.671
(relieved cheering)

02:46:11.671 --> 02:46:12.504
LAURA: What about your teeth?

02:46:12.504 --> 02:46:16.793
Are they fully tusks or are they filed still a little bit?

02:46:16.793 --> 02:46:18.196
MATT: They're where he left them previously.

02:46:18.196 --> 02:46:19.920
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:22.140
MATT: Should you have any interest or need, you can take--

02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:23.980
consider it a long rest.

02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:25.846
TALIESIN: Good to know.
LAURA: Oh cool!

02:46:25.846 --> 02:46:27.154
MARISHA: Interesting.

02:46:27.154 --> 02:46:30.175
LAURA: We could have gone in here
instead of taking a long rest.

02:46:30.175 --> 02:46:32.147
TALIESIN: We wouldn't have known that.
TRAVIS: No.

02:46:32.147 --> 02:46:36.160
TALIESIN: But we know this on
the way back, if things go haywire.

02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:38.870
TRAVIS: Also, they said it <i>mostly</i> worked.

02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:40.132
TALIESIN: Yes.
TRAVIS: So.

02:46:40.132 --> 02:46:42.120
SAM: I mean--
ASHLEY: That was the first chamber.

02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:43.853
SAM: You do have a tail now.

02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:46.010
ASHLEY: That was RE 01?

02:46:46.010 --> 02:46:47.531
SAM: And it's not where you think it is.

02:46:47.531 --> 02:46:50.467
TALIESIN: The only question left, is what's with the armor?

02:46:50.467 --> 02:46:52.820
MARISHA: Anything cool with the ar--? Oh.

02:46:52.820 --> 02:46:54.870
MATT: More so than even when Essek pointed it out,

02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:58.170
the space here after that display,

02:46:58.170 --> 02:47:00.670
you can strongly sense the expended dunamis

02:47:00.670 --> 02:47:03.410
in this space and you immediately begin to

02:47:03.410 --> 02:47:08.410
to tie the reasoning behind this effect

02:47:08.610 --> 02:47:12.128
and the acceleration of time, localized time.

02:47:13.638 --> 02:47:15.850
And Essek is kneeled down at the purple gem

02:47:15.850 --> 02:47:19.200
and is like, "How are they doing this?"

02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.583
TALIESIN: I've got a crazy idea.

02:47:21.630 --> 02:47:22.463
TRAVIS: Uh-huh?

02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.970
SAM: Oh, the eyes.

02:47:25.970 --> 02:47:27.889
TRAVIS: That would accelerate the eyes.

02:47:27.889 --> 02:47:30.310
LAURA: Oh yeah.
TRAVIS: It accelerates the rest.

02:47:30.310 --> 02:47:33.450
LAURA: It's a long rest, it's not like reset.

02:47:33.450 --> 02:47:34.410
TALIESIN: Darn.

02:47:34.410 --> 02:47:37.573
TRAVIS: Unless the green stone
makes it go a different direction.

02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:41.960
LIAM: I kneel down next to Essek at the gem.

02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:43.416
It is difficult.

02:47:44.570 --> 02:47:46.758
There is so much to learn here.

02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:51.570
Pray there's time, afterward.

02:47:51.570 --> 02:47:52.970
TALIESIN: If there's time afterward.

02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:55.650
TRAVIS: Is there another green stone

02:47:55.650 --> 02:47:56.760
or is it just the purple gem?

02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:59.470
TALIESIN: What's the gem on the second tank?

02:47:59.470 --> 02:48:00.303
MATT: They're both purple.

02:48:00.303 --> 02:48:01.601
TALIESIN: Okay.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:48:04.380 --> 02:48:06.213
SAM: Cool.

02:48:06.213 --> 02:48:07.971
TALIESIN: Keep an eye out for teal.

02:48:07.971 --> 02:48:09.470
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:48:09.470 --> 02:48:10.303
TALIESIN: Let's--

02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:14.634
LAURA: Oh yeah, did we take the armor? We took the armor.

02:48:14.634 --> 02:48:15.784
TALIESIN: We took the armor.
LAURA: What does it do?

02:48:15.784 --> 02:48:18.633
TALIESIN: We don't know.
We need to identify it.

02:48:18.633 --> 02:48:20.973
MARISHA: This armor, does it seem magical, do we know?

02:48:20.973 --> 02:48:21.806
MATT: You don't know.

02:48:21.806 --> 02:48:25.230
It has, you know, faint runes on edges of the plates.

02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:26.200
But that's all you know.

02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:28.200
MARISHA: Maybe we can identify it when we take that break.

02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:30.184
TALIESIN: All right.
LIAM: I mean, it's 10 minutes, so.

02:48:30.184 --> 02:48:31.350
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: You just decide

02:48:31.350 --> 02:48:33.050
now or later, it can be later.

02:48:33.050 --> 02:48:35.190
TRAVIS: I mean, do we need to take a break

02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:38.810
if we're standing next to the rejuvenation chamber?

02:48:38.810 --> 02:48:39.970
SAM: We're taking a break to do what?

02:48:39.970 --> 02:48:41.586
To identify some armor?

02:48:41.586 --> 02:48:42.680
LAURA: We're taking a break eventually,

02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:44.920
so that we can do the Heroes' Feast.

02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:46.080
TALIESIN: Let's go a little further, then.

02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:48.080
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's that.
TALIESIN: We'll go a little further.

02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:50.459
LAURA: Only if we want to do it.
TRAVIS: No, that's true.

02:48:50.459 --> 02:48:51.960
MARISHA: I mean, I think it's good to have.
LIAM: Well, wait.

02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:53.820
I'm going to do it.

02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:56.070
SAM: Do what?
LIAM: I'm going in that chamber.

02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:58.060
LAURA: Why?
SAM: Do you need to heal?

02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:01.270
LIAM: I'm curious to see if it restores--

02:49:01.270 --> 02:49:03.420
SAM: All your spell slots?
LIAM: Correct.

02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:06.997
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "If you want to try it."

02:49:06.997 --> 02:49:10.530
MARISHA: I guess this will answer that eyeballs question.

02:49:10.530 --> 02:49:11.730
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

02:49:11.730 --> 02:49:13.155
Maybe he'll get another one.

02:49:13.155 --> 02:49:14.228
MARISHA: Uh-huh?
TALIESIN: Ready?

02:49:14.228 --> 02:49:16.036
LIAM: I'll try RE 0-- Well.

02:49:16.036 --> 02:49:17.387
TRAVIS: Speedwagon?
LIAM: Yeah, I'll try RE 0--

02:49:17.387 --> 02:49:18.311
Always.

02:49:18.311 --> 02:49:20.060
LIAM: Two, yeah.
TALIESIN: Up to you.

02:49:20.060 --> 02:49:20.893
MATT: Okay.

02:49:20.893 --> 02:49:22.917
ASHLEY: Wait, but the second one is cracked.
LIAM: Is it?

02:49:22.917 --> 02:49:25.842
LAURA: Yeah, the second one's cracked.
Go in the first one, go in the first one.

02:49:25.842 --> 02:49:27.500
TRAVIS: No, no, no, go in second one.

02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:28.616
What's life without a little risk?

02:49:28.616 --> 02:49:31.070
LIAM: It's going to be good. Yep.
MATT: Up to you.

02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:32.260
LIAM: No, no, I'll go in the first one.

02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:34.820
I didn't remember it being described as cracked.

02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:35.653
MATT: Okay.

02:49:35.653 --> 02:49:38.697
Well, the first one is
currently closed, after Fjord exited it.

02:49:38.697 --> 02:49:40.810
MARISHA: Oh.
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and--

02:49:40.810 --> 02:49:42.910
MARISHA: So it has a cool down time?

02:49:42.910 --> 02:49:47.130
MATT: Okay, so you wave the purple again. (whooshing)

02:49:47.130 --> 02:49:48.097
It opens again.

02:49:48.097 --> 02:49:49.383
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Okay.

02:49:52.450 --> 02:49:54.340
TRAVIS: I farted it in there, I'm sorry, I was nervous.

02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:55.889
LIAM: (sniffs) Oh!

02:49:56.901 --> 02:49:58.542
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: It's pretty rank.

02:49:58.542 --> 02:50:00.242
LAURA and ASHLEY: (laugh)

02:50:00.242 --> 02:50:02.155
TRAVIS: Smell my dunamis!

02:50:02.155 --> 02:50:04.266
(laughter)

02:50:04.266 --> 02:50:06.040
SAM: Doo-doo-mancy?

02:50:08.061 --> 02:50:10.161
LIAM: Oh, I stepped in dunamis.

02:50:10.161 --> 02:50:11.494
TRAVIS: I can't hear you!

02:50:12.850 --> 02:50:14.910
MATT: It's coarse and it gets everywhere.

02:50:14.910 --> 02:50:17.860
TRAVIS: Oh god!
Oh, please.

02:50:17.860 --> 02:50:19.362
ASHLEY: Oh, that's what you're tasting?

02:50:19.362 --> 02:50:20.595
LAURA: Ew!
MATT: Yeah.

02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:26.100
MATT: You step inside, the door closes.

02:50:27.470 --> 02:50:32.340
The gem blinks twice

02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:33.927
and then goes dark.

02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:38.437
The door opens.

02:50:38.437 --> 02:50:41.298
TALIESIN: Have to try the other one, might be out of power.

02:50:41.298 --> 02:50:43.890
LIAM: That one looks a little damaged.

02:50:43.890 --> 02:50:45.220
TALIESIN: It might have to recharge.

02:50:45.220 --> 02:50:46.786
LIAM: Okay.

02:50:46.786 --> 02:50:47.919
Worth a try.

02:50:47.919 --> 02:50:49.200
TRAVIS: Does it have a fuel cell?

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.450
Like a pearl or something?

02:50:51.450 --> 02:50:53.251
I don't know, advanced technology,

02:50:53.251 --> 02:50:54.110
I was just thinking out loud.

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:56.038
MATT: "The gems seem to be some sort of...

02:50:58.290 --> 02:51:02.180
"whether it be a focus or
as the element of the rejuvenation,

02:51:02.180 --> 02:51:03.271
"I don't know.

02:51:04.943 --> 02:51:06.320
"It may take time for it to recharge.

02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:08.373
"It might require a specific input.

02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:10.640
"I don't know how much is the device

02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:15.640
"or just the basis of this gem."

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.590
TALIESIN: I mean, it would stand to reason that

02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:21.230
if it works with time,

02:51:21.230 --> 02:51:23.870
then the thing that would charge it would be time.

02:51:23.870 --> 02:51:26.589
So maybe it just collects time.

02:51:26.589 --> 02:51:29.113
LIAM: Yeah, maybe it's a slow recharge and a fast--

02:51:30.330 --> 02:51:31.931
LAURA: And then uses the time.

02:51:31.931 --> 02:51:33.056
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:51:33.056 --> 02:51:34.456
So it just will hold

02:51:34.456 --> 02:51:36.247
eight hours of time.
LAURA: You would think that over a thousand years,

02:51:36.247 --> 02:51:39.530
it would've charged a whole lot then.

02:51:39.530 --> 02:51:40.730
TALIESIN: Sometimes you fill a bottle

02:51:40.730 --> 02:51:42.332
only as far as you can fill the bottle.
TRAVIS: You know when you

02:51:42.332 --> 02:51:44.730
overcharge your phone, it's a bitch.

02:51:44.730 --> 02:51:49.020
TALIESIN: But yeah, like a water jug underneath a dripping--

02:51:49.020 --> 02:51:51.220
MATT: As you're having this conversation,

02:51:51.220 --> 02:51:54.303
you watch Essek drift over to the second damaged one.

02:51:58.100 --> 02:51:59.541
He gets down,

02:52:01.808 --> 02:52:04.049
looks closely at the purple gem.

02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:06.463
"Ah.

02:52:07.380 --> 02:52:08.213
"Caleb."

02:52:09.697 --> 02:52:11.100
Points at the gem.

02:52:13.730 --> 02:52:14.860
LAURA: I come peer over his shoulder--

02:52:14.860 --> 02:52:16.510
LIAM: Do I see what he's referring to?

02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:18.357
MATT: You glance over towards it

02:52:18.357 --> 02:52:19.823
and as he touches the back of your head

02:52:19.823 --> 02:52:21.697
and pushes your head close to it.

02:52:21.697 --> 02:52:23.720
And for a second, you resist.

02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:25.175
And as you glance in,

02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:29.473
the purple coloration begins to fade to the back.

02:52:30.490 --> 02:52:33.953
As instead you begin to see elements of space,

02:52:35.270 --> 02:52:37.340
drifting possibilities.

02:52:37.340 --> 02:52:41.753
It's almost like like a weaker,

02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:44.580
smaller replica--

02:52:44.580 --> 02:52:46.981
LIAM: Of a beacon.
MATT: Of a beacon.

02:52:46.981 --> 02:52:48.000
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.630
MATT: Embedded in the device right there.

02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:51.680
SAM: That's cool.

02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:53.350
TRAVIS: This will do a lot for their religion.

02:52:53.350 --> 02:52:55.700
LIAM: And this was not in the other,

02:52:55.700 --> 02:52:58.080
or it was and it's gone dark?

02:52:58.080 --> 02:52:59.910
MATT: A similar gem to that one, but that one's gone dark.

02:52:59.910 --> 02:53:00.743
LIAM: Yeah.

02:53:03.193 --> 02:53:06.664
What do you do with this knowledge?

02:53:07.838 --> 02:53:08.896
MATT: "I don't know."

02:53:08.896 --> 02:53:10.089
LAURA: Should you take it?

02:53:10.089 --> 02:53:11.622
TRAVIS: Yeah, you wanna--

02:53:11.622 --> 02:53:14.980
MARISHA: Yeah, can you swap-a-do?

02:53:14.980 --> 02:53:16.972
LIAM: Or we just take <i>it</i>?

02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:18.993
I'm not that badly.

02:53:18.993 --> 02:53:20.500
LAURA: Whatever we decide to do, we should do it quickly

02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:21.990
because--
LIAM: We should do that.

02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:24.675
I'm not that badly tapped.
MATT: "True enough."

02:53:24.675 --> 02:53:27.000
You stand up a bit, you see Essek puts his hand out

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:30.770
and begins to concentrate, his eyes narrowing.

02:53:30.770 --> 02:53:33.360
As he does, you watch as the smooth,

02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:35.560
relatively untouched stone base

02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:39.035
of this glass tube device

02:53:39.035 --> 02:53:40.993
(stone cracking)

02:53:40.993 --> 02:53:43.210
begin to crack and crumble.

02:53:43.210 --> 02:53:46.870
Before you see it get pulled away

02:53:46.870 --> 02:53:48.900
and dragged under the ground behind, scattering.

02:53:48.900 --> 02:53:51.630
The glass breaking, and as opposed to shattering around you,

02:53:51.630 --> 02:53:54.510
being shunted off to the backside of the wall,

02:53:54.510 --> 02:53:56.060
scattering on the ground.

02:53:56.060 --> 02:53:58.710
LIAM: He controlled the direction of it all smashing apart?

02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:59.630
MATT: Yeah.

02:53:59.630 --> 02:54:01.460
As it all scatters across the way,

02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:03.830
it's just the base now where it's cracked.

02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:06.040
And as it all falls away, he turns his hand up,

02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:07.710
and as he does, it's like

02:54:08.750 --> 02:54:11.280
an invisible hand digging into clay

02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:13.510
and lifting through as it sifts past the fingers.

02:54:13.510 --> 02:54:15.700
You see the rock lift and then crumble,

02:54:15.700 --> 02:54:16.533
and then there in the center,

02:54:16.533 --> 02:54:19.600
you see this diamond-shaped gem,

02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:23.863
of faint dark purple coloration, that was now released.

02:54:25.138 --> 02:54:28.038
He lifts it and drifts it over into your hand.

02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:32.690
LIAM: Don't you think you should hold on to this?

02:54:32.690 --> 02:54:34.040
MATT: "There's two, isn't there?"

02:54:35.240 --> 02:54:36.073
LIAM: True.

02:54:41.876 --> 02:54:43.700
I'm just struck by the enormity

02:54:43.700 --> 02:54:45.400
of what I'm holding in my fingers.

02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:50.587
LAURA: Are you going to take the other one, Essek?

02:54:50.587 --> 02:54:51.927
MATT: "If we have time."

02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:54.830
SAM: Won't that break the machine?

02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:55.663
TRAVIS: Yeah, that breaks the machine.

02:54:55.663 --> 02:54:57.757
SAM: Is that okay? I guess we're not--

02:54:57.757 --> 02:54:59.064
LAURA: We're leaving.
MARISHA: You don't want to take the machines?

02:54:59.064 --> 02:55:00.397
MATT: "We can keep the one machine and keep

02:55:00.397 --> 02:55:01.230
"that one as we go."

02:55:01.230 --> 02:55:02.788
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Yes, keep one intact.

02:55:02.788 --> 02:55:04.430
TRAVIS: B-3 to B-9.
MARISHA: We know that this is here, yeah.

02:55:04.430 --> 02:55:06.210
TALIESIN: We can come back.

02:55:06.210 --> 02:55:07.805
MARISHA: To B-9!
TALIESIN: Won't matter if we don't.

02:55:07.805 --> 02:55:08.638
LAURA: Okay.

02:55:08.638 --> 02:55:09.715
LIAM: Or to B-10.

02:55:09.715 --> 02:55:10.907
LAURA: We go.
TALIESIN: We go.

02:55:10.907 --> 02:55:11.740
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: B-9.

02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:13.040
LIAM: Or not to be.

02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:15.823
MARISHA: Yeah. Definitely not 2-B.

02:55:16.830 --> 02:55:18.080
MATT: Okay?
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:19.210
On the road again.

02:55:19.210 --> 02:55:20.410
MATT: You all exit the sealed chamber

02:55:20.410 --> 02:55:21.935
back into the main room.

02:55:25.380 --> 02:55:29.238
There is a horrid stench in this room.

02:55:29.238 --> 02:55:30.771
LAURA: Fjord!

02:55:31.888 --> 02:55:33.619
SAM: Haven't we been in this room before?

02:55:33.619 --> 02:55:34.504
MATT: You have.

02:55:34.504 --> 02:55:35.970
SAM: But it wasn't like this before?

02:55:35.970 --> 02:55:37.161
MATT: Not previously.
LIAM: It's the oxygen

02:55:37.161 --> 02:55:37.994
hitting the bodies.

02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:39.652
TALIESIN: What's changed?

02:55:39.652 --> 02:55:40.590
I'm looking around.

02:55:40.590 --> 02:55:42.240
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:44.173
TALIESIN: 26.
MATT: 26.

02:55:46.330 --> 02:55:48.170
The smell is strong and catches you all

02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:49.920
as you glance around a bit.

02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:56.060
There is also the matter of the two other glass tubes

02:55:56.060 --> 02:56:00.270
in this chamber that have now lifted up

02:56:00.270 --> 02:56:02.803
about five feet from their embedded positions.

02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:09.578
At that point you hear

02:56:09.578 --> 02:56:13.855
(heavy breathing, chittering).

02:56:13.855 --> 02:56:16.230
SAM: Oh, that's not a good sound.

02:56:16.230 --> 02:56:17.873
LIAM: It's not the bodies.

02:56:26.909 --> 02:56:29.167
MATT: (panting)

02:56:29.167 --> 02:56:31.510
A weird, odd series of gasps

02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:33.584
and chittering and

02:56:35.384 --> 02:56:38.892
slimy, lip-smacking sounds.

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.122
MARISHA: We could run.

02:56:42.122 --> 02:56:43.850
LAURA: We could run and just go for it.

02:56:43.850 --> 02:56:45.560
MARISHA: And just go down.

02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:46.523
TRAVIS: Or just leap off.

02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:50.717
ASHLEY: Let's go.

02:56:52.130 --> 02:56:54.100
SAM: Do we get a sense of which direction

02:56:54.100 --> 02:56:56.400
on the doughnut these sounds are coming from?

02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:59.075
MATT: You do. It's coming kind of from both sides.

02:56:59.075 --> 02:57:00.170
SAM: Oh, great.

02:57:00.170 --> 02:57:02.932
MATT: Which means you're uncertain. You don't see anything.

02:57:02.932 --> 02:57:05.970
This room is fairly well lit.

02:57:05.970 --> 02:57:06.878
LIAM: Share that thought?

02:57:06.878 --> 02:57:10.140
MARISHA: Yeah. Anything?
TRAVIS: You could just say it.

02:57:10.140 --> 02:57:10.973
SAM: We're going to run?

02:57:10.973 --> 02:57:14.370
TALIESIN: I'm pulling, I'm slowly pulling out a celebone.

02:57:14.370 --> 02:57:15.462
MARISHA: Oh, distraction.

02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:18.850
TALIESIN: On three.
TRAVIS: Go.

02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:21.030
TALIESIN: And I'm going to activate it

02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:23.573
and throw it into the other room.

02:57:24.690 --> 02:57:25.523
MATT: Which room?

02:57:25.523 --> 02:57:28.234
TRAVIS: You mean down into the hole?
SAM: The repair room?

02:57:28.234 --> 02:57:30.240
TALIESIN: I assume that the two hallways are here

02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:32.229
and we're in the middle of them?

02:57:32.229 --> 02:57:33.800
MATT: There's two hallways this way, and then

02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:34.700
there's the chamber.

02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:35.740
TALIESIN: And they're in the chamber.

02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:37.190
MATT: They're in the chamber, you assume.

02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:39.050
The sound is coming from both sides,

02:57:39.050 --> 02:57:40.160
around the center column.

02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:42.770
TALIESIN: I am turning on the celebone and throwing it

02:57:42.770 --> 02:57:45.150
into the repair room as far as I can.

02:57:45.150 --> 02:57:47.883
MATT: Okay. (whooshing, bouncing)

02:57:49.366 --> 02:57:51.282
(hissing)

02:57:52.179 --> 02:57:53.480
And you see a shape

02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:56.443
begin to step around the right side of the pillar.

02:57:57.570 --> 02:57:59.403
TALIESIN: Let's slowly walk around.

02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:02.990
The celebone should be making a bunch of--

02:58:02.990 --> 02:58:04.550
MATT: It is.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:06.116
MATT: It is quite a ways down that hall.

02:58:06.116 --> 02:58:07.830
It heard the impact.

02:58:07.830 --> 02:58:09.750
There is the light reflecting down

02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:11.070
and you're all standing right outside

02:58:11.070 --> 02:58:12.170
of the sealed doorway.

02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:15.344
MARISHA: Can we start scooching to the right?

02:58:15.344 --> 02:58:18.780
LAURA: I'm going to try to help out Caduceus.

02:58:18.780 --> 02:58:21.480
I'm going to take out one of the bags of chuckle dust

02:58:22.420 --> 02:58:25.920
as well, and chuck it in the same area.

02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:29.153
Which will let off laughter down the hallway.

02:58:33.347 --> 02:58:36.260
MATT: (cackling)

02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:39.770
At which point, the creature, whatever the shape is,

02:58:39.770 --> 02:58:41.700
begins to dart around the side

02:58:41.700 --> 02:58:44.270
where you're standing

02:58:44.270 --> 02:58:46.000
and where the hallway is to your right,

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.160
as it turns in the way.

02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:51.100
It stops, noticing your shapes as you're shifting.

02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:53.913
You see something oddly familiar.

02:58:55.510 --> 02:58:59.530
About a 11-, 12-foot tall humanoid creature

02:58:59.530 --> 02:59:02.180
with a brownish-yellow, leathery skin,

02:59:02.180 --> 02:59:05.200
elongated arms that almost drag across the ground

02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:07.110
that end in thin claws.

02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:10.600
You see a serpent-like head that arcs over its shoulders

02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:14.463
high up and then across its body, dozens of small mouths.

02:59:16.530 --> 02:59:18.000
You saw one of these in a tube

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.520
in one of the previous Aeor ruins.

02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:22.863
However, here one has been unleashed.

02:59:22.863 --> 02:59:24.704
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:59:24.704 --> 02:59:25.871
MATT: I need you all to roll initiative.

02:59:25.871 --> 02:59:27.360
(yelling)

02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:29.018
LAURA: Was it called an enforcer?

02:59:29.018 --> 02:59:30.753
Or a--
LIAM: Absorber?

02:59:30.753 --> 02:59:32.970
SAM: This combat is brought to you by Dwarven Forge,

02:59:32.970 --> 02:59:36.297
makers of premium hand-crafted gaming terrain.

02:59:36.297 --> 02:59:38.040
MARISHA: The eyeball thing was, yeah, the Absorber.

02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:41.640
SAM: Guys, are you DTF, Down To Forge?

02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:43.590
Then get your hands on some Dwarven Forge

02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:44.931
premium tabletop terrain

02:59:44.931 --> 02:59:46.530
and take your games to the next level.

02:59:46.530 --> 02:59:49.630
Check it out at bit.ly/critroleDF.

02:59:50.530 --> 02:59:52.620
Whoa.
LAURA: Awesome.

02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:55.495
ALL: Shots, shots, shots.

02:59:57.993 --> 03:00:00.030
SAM: Copyright.
MATT: Tell me where you are placed within,

03:00:00.030 --> 03:00:02.240
because this was the hallway
that you threw the celebone down.

03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:03.360
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:05.735
TALIESIN: I was starting to sneak around

03:00:05.735 --> 03:00:06.951
the other side.
TRAVIS: Where were we coming from, Matt?

03:00:06.951 --> 03:00:08.001
LAURA: We were coming from--

03:00:08.001 --> 03:00:10.043
MATT: You guys entered this way, came around.

03:00:10.043 --> 03:00:13.372
This was the room where the tubes were.

03:00:13.372 --> 03:00:14.372
You exited out this way,

03:00:14.372 --> 03:00:15.911
this is that central pillar on the raised place.

03:00:15.911 --> 03:00:18.030
This is the collapsed section in the middle here.

03:00:18.030 --> 03:00:20.040
And these are the two available tubes.

03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:23.150
This is where the celebone and chuckle dust got thrown.

03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:25.980
TALIESIN: Which way is the way out?

03:00:25.980 --> 03:00:27.638
MATT: This way.
LIAM: This whole battle's going to the sound

03:00:27.638 --> 03:00:29.371
of laughing and giggling.
TALIESIN: We would have been trying

03:00:29.371 --> 03:00:31.358
to make our way that direction.

03:00:31.358 --> 03:00:32.191
MATT: Correct.

03:00:33.376 --> 03:00:35.587
MARISHA: We still have Heroes' Feast, right?

03:00:35.587 --> 03:00:37.948
LAURA: I think so.
LIAM: Yeah, that's a battle.

03:00:39.588 --> 03:00:40.578
ASHLEY: Is Heroes' Feast--?

03:00:40.578 --> 03:00:41.411
MATT: Yasha?

03:00:41.411 --> 03:00:44.250
LAURA: 10 minutes.
MARISHA: I hope so.

03:00:44.250 --> 03:00:47.187
ASHLEY: Yes, yeah, around there.

03:00:47.187 --> 03:00:48.053
LIAM: If we all die--
MATT: Around here?

03:00:48.053 --> 03:00:51.222
ASHLEY: A little closer to-- where is he? Where's this dude?

03:00:51.222 --> 03:00:53.097
It doesn't matter.
I wouldn't know, okay.

03:00:53.097 --> 03:00:54.767
MATT: About there.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:00:54.767 --> 03:00:57.890
LIAM: Oh no.
SAM: Evil brute.

03:00:57.890 --> 03:00:59.670
LIAM: That's a thing, right there.

03:00:59.670 --> 03:01:01.215
MATT: All right, so about there, or elsewhere?

03:01:01.215 --> 03:01:02.990
LIAM: Technical term.

03:01:02.990 --> 03:01:04.889
ASHLEY: That's good.
MATT: Jester?

03:01:04.889 --> 03:01:06.133
LAURA: I'd probably--

03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:12.210
I'll say I'm right next to the contraption.

03:01:12.210 --> 03:01:13.770
MATT: Over here?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:13.770 --> 03:01:16.120
Because I would have had to been able to chuck the bag.

03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:18.353
MATT: All righty. Veth?

03:01:18.353 --> 03:01:20.590
SAM: Just around the doorway somewhere.

03:01:20.590 --> 03:01:21.423
MATT: Right here?

03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:23.760
Okay. Essek,

03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:26.130
I'll say is probably just starting to emerge out here.

03:01:26.130 --> 03:01:27.920
LIAM: I was going to say the wizards were probably lagging,

03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:29.401
so I'll be behind him.

03:01:29.401 --> 03:01:30.234
MATT: Okay.

03:01:31.378 --> 03:01:32.286
Beauregard?

03:01:32.286 --> 03:01:36.440
MARISHA: I'll be up near Caduceus, in his window.

03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:37.273
MATT: Over here.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:01:37.273 --> 03:01:39.252
TRAVIS: ♪ In your window ♪
MARISHA: Yeah. That's fine.

03:01:39.252 --> 03:01:41.330
ASHLEY: This a hole in the center of the room?

03:01:41.330 --> 03:01:42.370
LIAM: No.

03:01:42.370 --> 03:01:43.620
MATT: This is a collapsed pile.

03:01:43.620 --> 03:01:46.240
This is just where the roof has caved in.

03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:47.820
ASHLEY: Got it.

03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:50.643
LAURA: Oh god, that thing looks really--

03:01:50.643 --> 03:01:51.532
TRAVIS: Friendly?

03:01:51.532 --> 03:01:52.365
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:53.490 --> 03:01:56.400
LIAM: Oh man, look at the cracked cylinders, even.

03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:58.970
LAURA: Matt, can you spin him around so we can get another--

03:01:58.970 --> 03:02:01.583
I just want to see his little face.

03:02:02.947 --> 03:02:04.421
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:02:04.421 --> 03:02:05.313
SAM: Quick, let's run!

03:02:05.313 --> 03:02:06.473
He's not looking at us!

03:02:07.430 --> 03:02:10.683
LAURA: Ooh, look at all those mouths!

03:02:10.683 --> 03:02:13.297
MATT: Yep, on the chest and on the back.

03:02:13.297 --> 03:02:15.890
LAURA and MARISHA: Ugh!

03:02:15.890 --> 03:02:17.450
MATT: He's fun.

03:02:17.450 --> 03:02:19.576
ASHLEY: He's like the Laughing Hand with all those--

03:02:19.576 --> 03:02:20.879
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was just thinking that.

03:02:20.879 --> 03:02:23.570
LIAM: I'm wondering if there's any distant connection.

03:02:23.570 --> 03:02:26.753
MARISHA: Well, we had to--

03:02:26.753 --> 03:02:28.920
Because Obann stole the heart,

03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:33.340
and then we had to go into the Happy Fun Ball

03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:37.720
to kill the Permaheart, so we could kill the Laughing Hand,

03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:38.800
if you recall.

03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:42.255
So, yeah.
LAURA: Could potentially, yeah.

03:02:42.255 --> 03:02:43.105
MARISHA: It tracks.

03:02:43.105 --> 03:02:45.370
LIAM: Halas was a couple of centuries off of this city,

03:02:45.370 --> 03:02:46.850
but that's only a couple of centuries.

03:02:46.850 --> 03:02:48.158
MARISHA: Halas could have been fucking

03:02:48.158 --> 03:02:50.308
dumpster diving in Aeor,

03:02:50.308 --> 03:02:52.850
or he could have been the first Aeorian dumpster diver.

03:02:52.850 --> 03:02:53.683
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:53.683 --> 03:02:54.872
MATT: 25 to 20.

03:02:54.872 --> 03:02:56.419
LAURA: 22.
MATT: Nice.

03:02:56.419 --> 03:02:58.738
SAM: 22.
LAURA: Ooh.

03:02:58.738 --> 03:03:00.260
TRAVIS: Who goes first then, Veth?
LAURA: Nott.

03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:02.740
MATT: Veth.
LAURA: Veth, god!

03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:03.660
LIAM: Not bad.
MATT: It's all good.

03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:05.338
ASHLEY: 20.
MATT: 20, nice.

03:03:06.868 --> 03:03:08.001
Yasha.

03:03:09.278 --> 03:03:10.636
20 to 15?

03:03:10.636 --> 03:03:12.035
MARISHA: 15.
TALIESIN: 15.

03:03:12.035 --> 03:03:13.170
TRAVIS: 15.

03:03:13.170 --> 03:03:14.870
MATT: Wow.
MARISHA: Oh!

03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:16.635
TRAVIS: Beau, Caduceus, Fjord.

03:03:20.517 --> 03:03:21.513
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:03:22.610 --> 03:03:24.410
MATT: All right, and then Caleb?

03:03:24.410 --> 03:03:25.243
LIAM: Nine.

03:03:27.015 --> 03:03:28.131
SAM: This'll do.

03:03:31.140 --> 03:03:32.640
TRAVIS: Show me that fucking weapon.

03:03:36.633 --> 03:03:38.203
SAM: I don't know if I have to attune to it.

03:03:39.232 --> 03:03:41.448
TALIESIN: You seemed to be able to fire it just fine.

03:03:41.448 --> 03:03:44.023
MATT: Actually as this-- I will say,

03:03:44.023 --> 03:03:45.006
what probably would have happened,

03:03:45.006 --> 03:03:45.990
is you guys all were all prepping

03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:50.750
and doing this space, as this was happening,

03:03:50.750 --> 03:03:55.030
Essek, you see him begin to cast something

03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:57.380
and then condense it into his hand.

03:03:57.380 --> 03:03:59.613
And hand you this small bead,

03:03:59.613 --> 03:04:01.037
Veth.
SAM: Another one?

03:04:01.037 --> 03:04:02.860
MATT: This is like a marble.

03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:06.050
And just goes, "Follow my lead."

03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:07.000
SAM: Follow your what?

03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:10.770
TRAVIS: Lead.
MATT: "Aim it when you want."

03:04:10.770 --> 03:04:12.320
SAM: (stutters) Aim it?

03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:13.753
MARISHA: (laughs)
LIAM: Giving you a bullet.

03:04:13.753 --> 03:04:15.217
MATT: And he just hands it to you.

03:04:15.217 --> 03:04:17.460
LIAM: Giving you a dunamis bullet.

03:04:17.460 --> 03:04:19.243
SAM: To put in my thing?

03:04:20.375 --> 03:04:22.238
MARISHA: Just be cool.

03:04:22.238 --> 03:04:23.651
(laughter)

03:04:23.651 --> 03:04:26.101
MATT: (laughs) "Just be cool."

03:04:26.101 --> 03:04:28.413
MARISHA: Go with it!

03:04:28.413 --> 03:04:30.777
SAM: What am I supposed to do with it?!
TRAVIS: Take the drugs!

03:04:30.777 --> 03:04:32.433
Take it and swallow it!

03:04:32.433 --> 03:04:34.216
MATT: "Aim and focus."

03:04:34.216 --> 03:04:36.360
SAM: Aim what?!

03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:40.112
MATT: So top of the round. Veth, you're up first.

03:04:40.112 --> 03:04:41.281
SAM: (screams)

03:04:41.281 --> 03:04:45.699
(laughter)

03:04:45.699 --> 03:04:48.810
SAM: I'm going to strafe to my right.

03:04:48.810 --> 03:04:53.426
Run to my right and aim it.

03:04:53.426 --> 03:04:57.484
(laughter)

03:04:59.270 --> 03:05:01.243
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Yeah, hold it up.

03:05:03.400 --> 03:05:05.113
Has anything happened?

03:05:06.940 --> 03:05:08.630
MATT: You use your action to focus on it.

03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:09.483
SAM: Yeah.

03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:13.886
MATT: As you release,

03:05:13.886 --> 03:05:14.819
(electricity arcs)
SAM: (screams)

03:05:14.819 --> 03:05:17.120
MATT: A bolt of black lightning

03:05:17.120 --> 03:05:20.473
arcs out from it, across the way towards the creature.

03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:22.600
It's a level four Lightning Bolt.

03:05:22.600 --> 03:05:25.094
Go ahead and roll 9d6.

03:05:25.094 --> 03:05:27.211
TRAVIS: Whoa!
SAM: 9d6!

03:05:27.211 --> 03:05:29.167
TRAVIS: Whoa.

03:05:29.167 --> 03:05:32.858
ASHLEY: Holy mackerel.
MATT: It does not make its save.

03:05:36.384 --> 03:05:39.910
SAM: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:05:39.910 --> 03:05:43.310
LAURA: That's right, these guys were
immune to radiant and necrotic.

03:05:43.310 --> 03:05:44.962
SAM: 28.

03:05:44.962 --> 03:05:48.840
MATT: 28. 28 lightning damage.

03:05:48.840 --> 03:05:51.078
TALIESIN: 28 points.
MATT: Out of the gate.

03:05:51.078 --> 03:05:53.870
All right.
SAM: Wow. That was cool.

03:05:53.870 --> 03:05:55.650
MATT: So that's your action and your move.

03:05:55.650 --> 03:05:56.763
Are you going to stay put?

03:05:58.640 --> 03:05:59.473
SAM: Yeah. No.

03:05:59.473 --> 03:06:02.958
I'll tuck behind the big pedestal, I guess.

03:06:02.958 --> 03:06:03.945
Okay.

03:06:07.045 --> 03:06:08.490
Movement 30?
SAM: Mm-hmm.

03:06:08.490 --> 03:06:10.290
MATT: Yeah, that's about as far as you can get right there.

03:06:10.290 --> 03:06:11.991
You got it. All right, that finishes your go, Veth.

03:06:11.991 --> 03:06:14.305
Jester, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

03:06:14.305 --> 03:06:17.300
LAURA: I'm going to peek out from behind the thingy

03:06:19.170 --> 03:06:22.620
and I'm going to hold my hand out

03:06:22.620 --> 03:06:25.552
and hope and pray and cast Polymorph on it.

03:06:25.552 --> 03:06:27.603
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Good call.

03:06:29.780 --> 03:06:32.130
MATT: You go ahead and begin casting the spell.

03:06:32.130 --> 03:06:35.277
And one of the arms reaches up towards you, (hissing)

03:06:35.277 --> 03:06:38.433
as it does, the spell unravels.

03:06:38.433 --> 03:06:41.430
LIAM: Oh shit! Good to know.

03:06:41.430 --> 03:06:44.588
MATT: No effect.
TRAVIS: Sure. Made by wizards.

03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:48.061
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

03:06:48.061 --> 03:06:49.402
Oh boy!

03:06:49.402 --> 03:06:51.770
MATT: You still have 25 feet of movement.

03:06:51.770 --> 03:06:54.270
LAURA: I should move. I'm going to--

03:06:54.270 --> 03:06:56.290
MATT: And a bonus action.

03:06:56.290 --> 03:06:57.690
If you're going to use that.

03:06:59.934 --> 03:07:03.280
SAM: (sings exciting music)

03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:07.050
LAURA: I'm going to, oh god, run across

03:07:07.050 --> 03:07:09.380
and try to get into the other tunnel.

03:07:09.380 --> 03:07:10.279
MATT: Over here?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:07:10.279 --> 03:07:11.712
LIAM: Oh boy.

03:07:14.260 --> 03:07:15.820
MATT: 30, that's about as far as you can move right there.

03:07:15.820 --> 03:07:16.910
Rushing past Yasha.

03:07:16.910 --> 03:07:19.157
TRAVIS: Maybe that was its reaction.

03:07:19.157 --> 03:07:21.003
LAURA: Yeah, maybe. Probably.

03:07:22.500 --> 03:07:23.333
Okay.

03:07:23.333 --> 03:07:25.762
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Jester?

03:07:25.762 --> 03:07:28.063
Yasha, you're up.
TRAVIS: Fuck.

03:07:28.063 --> 03:07:30.886
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.
TRAVIS: (high-pitched gibberish)

03:07:30.886 --> 03:07:33.510
(laughter)

03:07:34.690 --> 03:07:37.390
ASHLEY: And I'm going to run on over to him.

03:07:37.390 --> 03:07:38.958
MATT: You've got it.
LAURA: Get him.

03:07:38.958 --> 03:07:40.001
ASHLEY: Take a swing.

03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:43.270
Do I have 50 feet to get on it?

03:07:43.270 --> 03:07:45.090
MATT: You need 50 feet to get there, yes.

03:07:45.090 --> 03:07:45.923
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:07:47.010 --> 03:07:47.843
Here we go.

03:07:53.196 --> 03:07:54.512
LAURA: So apparently you can do

03:07:54.512 --> 03:07:55.654
melee spells--
ASHLEY: 21.

03:07:55.654 --> 03:07:56.820
MATT: 21 does it.

03:07:56.820 --> 03:07:58.134
ASHLEY: (exhales) Okay.

03:07:58.134 --> 03:08:00.258
TRAVIS: Is this hallway right here collapsed?

03:08:00.258 --> 03:08:01.183
MATT: It's not collapsed,

03:08:01.183 --> 03:08:03.140
but it is considered difficult terrain.

03:08:03.140 --> 03:08:04.490
It does take 10 feet of movement

03:08:04.490 --> 03:08:06.640
to move past it, because of the barricades.

03:08:07.833 --> 03:08:10.650
ASHLEY: I'll do Savage Attacker because that wasn't great.

03:08:12.956 --> 03:08:14.629
That one was better. Okay.

03:08:15.652 --> 03:08:17.608
Here we fucking go.

03:08:17.608 --> 03:08:19.183
LIAM: (quietly) Out of initiative.

03:08:22.515 --> 03:08:24.307
ASHLEY: What was that again?

03:08:25.870 --> 03:08:29.950
That would be 33 for the-- 33
points of damage for the first--

03:08:29.950 --> 03:08:31.680
MATT: How much of that was radiant?

03:08:31.680 --> 03:08:33.013
ASHLEY: Seven points of damage.

03:08:33.013 --> 03:08:35.380
MATT: Okay, a little less damage than you expected.

03:08:35.380 --> 03:08:37.800
TRAVIS: Radiant's out.
ASHLEY: Radiant's out.

03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:39.633
Okay, second hit.

03:08:43.075 --> 03:08:44.149
16?

03:08:44.149 --> 03:08:46.347
MATT: 16 does not hit.
ASHLEY: (growls)

03:08:46.347 --> 03:08:47.180
MATT: Second shot goes wide.

03:08:47.180 --> 03:08:49.990
As you hit once across, you see one of the mouths

03:08:49.990 --> 03:08:51.248
splits open on the side,

03:08:51.248 --> 03:08:53.123
revealing some of its internal organs

03:08:53.970 --> 03:08:55.180
and then it tenses.

03:08:55.180 --> 03:08:56.580
And that wound closes a little bit

03:08:56.580 --> 03:08:58.050
just from the muscle tension.

03:08:58.050 --> 03:09:01.860
The other swing, you go towards it and its body bends

03:09:01.860 --> 03:09:05.520
and arcs out of the way and it flies wide, no impact.

03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:07.880
Does that finish your turn, Yasha?

03:09:07.880 --> 03:09:09.380
ASHLEY: That finishes my turn.

03:09:09.380 --> 03:09:12.125
MATT: Okay. Now it is its turn.

03:09:12.125 --> 03:09:14.870
MARISHA: No.
TRAVIS: After Yasha.

03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:15.703
ASHLEY: Hello.

03:09:16.890 --> 03:09:18.280
TRAVIS: Edward Scissorhands.

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:19.113
MATT: All right.

03:09:20.313 --> 03:09:23.631
It is going to shift around this way--

03:09:23.631 --> 03:09:25.339
TRAVIS: Avon calling!

03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:29.713
MATT: -- to about there.

03:09:30.610 --> 03:09:35.112
And stepping up onto the large pillar with its long legs

03:09:35.112 --> 03:09:37.062
spider climbing up the edge of it.

03:09:37.062 --> 03:09:39.950
As it turns around, it is going to slash into you.

03:09:39.950 --> 03:09:41.320
ASHLEY: Do I get a-- no, because--

03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:45.596
MATT: It's still in your range.
SAM: ♪ Won't you come slash into me ♪

03:09:46.812 --> 03:09:48.295
TRAVIS: Stop it!
LAURA: ♪ Into me! ♪

03:09:48.295 --> 03:09:49.149
TRAVIS: Wow!

03:09:49.149 --> 03:09:50.862
SAM: ♪ (Dave Mathews impression) ♪

03:09:50.862 --> 03:09:51.857
TRAVIS: (barfing sounds)

03:09:51.857 --> 03:09:53.361
TALIESIN: No.

03:09:53.361 --> 03:09:54.194
TRAVIS: (barfing sounds)

03:09:55.050 --> 03:09:56.682
MATT: Two claw attacks against you.

03:09:56.682 --> 03:09:59.000
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: '95 just barfed in my mouth.

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.070
MATT: That is going to be an 18 to hit.

03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:03.278
ASHLEY: Oh, just hits.

03:10:03.278 --> 03:10:05.510
MATT: And a 16 to hit.

03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:08.500
ASHLEY: Doesn't hit.
MATT: All right, the first one hits you.

03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:11.020
One claw just ends up being deflecting it with the sword.

03:10:11.020 --> 03:10:13.560
The second one strikes you across the side.

03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:15.843
You take--

03:10:15.843 --> 03:10:17.310
ASHLEY: This is slashing?

03:10:17.310 --> 03:10:18.143
MATT: Yes.

03:10:19.451 --> 03:10:23.059
14 points of slashing damage, reduced to seven.

03:10:23.980 --> 03:10:26.340
But it also deals on top of that,

03:10:26.340 --> 03:10:28.300
much like the similar other creatures that you saw,

03:10:28.300 --> 03:10:29.180
as it strikes you,

03:10:29.180 --> 03:10:32.230
there's an additional burst of force energy

03:10:32.230 --> 03:10:34.540
through its strike that punctures the wounds

03:10:34.540 --> 03:10:37.701
even deeper, and you take-- Oh shit!

03:10:38.770 --> 03:10:40.040
ASHLEY: That's never good.

03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:41.570
MATT: I rolled two tens, that is,

03:10:41.570 --> 03:10:42.920
take 20 points of force damage.

03:10:42.920 --> 03:10:44.125
TRAVIS: Whoa!
ASHLEY: That's for--

03:10:44.125 --> 03:10:46.390
That's-- I just take all that.

03:10:46.390 --> 03:10:48.370
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I just take it like a champ.

03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:52.773
MATT: And it's going to--
ASHLEY: 20 points of damage.

03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:56.143
Is that magical?

03:10:57.430 --> 03:10:58.810
Is that a magical effect?

03:10:58.810 --> 03:11:00.680
MATT: It is just force damage.

03:11:00.680 --> 03:11:02.477
ASHLEY: It's just a straight old-- okay.

03:11:02.477 --> 03:11:05.340
MATT: Yeah. You are also now grappled by it.

03:11:05.340 --> 03:11:06.710
TRAVIS: Because it's like you're--

03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:08.553
MATT: As it claws and pulls you in,

03:11:09.450 --> 03:11:10.840
and it's holding you there

03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:13.970
and as it does its giant serpent jaw unhinges

03:11:13.970 --> 03:11:15.610
and bites down over your head.

03:11:15.610 --> 03:11:17.660
TRAVIS: Oh man!
SAM: Oh jeez.

03:11:17.660 --> 03:11:20.562
MATT: That is going to be a 25 to hit.

03:11:20.562 --> 03:11:22.811
ASHLEY: That doesn't hit. Yeah, it hits. Of course it hits.

03:11:22.811 --> 03:11:24.306
TRAVIS: Oh, what the hell.

03:11:26.026 --> 03:11:26.859
MARISHA: God.

03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:31.248
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

03:11:31.248 --> 03:11:34.284
MATT: 24 points of piercing damage, reduced to 12.

03:11:34.284 --> 03:11:35.520
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:38.261
MATT: As well as

03:11:38.261 --> 03:11:40.244
16 points of force damage.

03:11:40.244 --> 03:11:41.372
ASHLEY: So that I take, okay.

03:11:41.372 --> 03:11:42.950
MATT: Yeah. As the teeth clamp down into you

03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:46.070
and as they bite in, you feel like there's an extension

03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:49.490
to the dagger-like teeth, carving deeper in,

03:11:49.490 --> 03:11:52.316
and for a brief second, you're afraid it might just

03:11:52.316 --> 03:11:54.670
take the top half of your body off with the bite

03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:56.690
Before you manage to shove out of its jaw

03:11:56.690 --> 03:11:58.020
and elbow it backward.

03:11:58.020 --> 03:12:00.780
It's still holding you in place, but it's (gnashing)

03:12:00.780 --> 03:12:04.960
and in that way you can hear the horrible gnashing

03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:08.610
and all the mouths around it are like (gnashing),

03:12:08.610 --> 03:12:12.509
creating this loud din around it. That finishes its turn.

03:12:12.509 --> 03:12:14.980
TRAVIS: That was 74 points of damage in one round.

03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:15.817
MATT: Beau, you're up.

03:12:15.817 --> 03:12:18.017
MARISHA: Holy shit!

03:12:19.058 --> 03:12:23.999
That both I and Beau say upon seeing this.

03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:27.510
I'm going to use my staff to pole vault

03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:31.800
over Caduceus and Jester and run up.

03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:33.517
And as I run by, I'm going to say:

03:12:33.517 --> 03:12:35.430
I still think we should get out of here.

03:12:35.430 --> 03:12:39.130
And do a big windmill of my staff over my head

03:12:39.130 --> 03:12:40.760
and come down with a pop, pop.

03:12:40.760 --> 03:12:42.310
MATT: Go for it, roll two attacks.

03:12:44.410 --> 03:12:47.669
MARISHA: Okay, that is a 21 and a 22 to hit.

03:12:47.669 --> 03:12:50.010
MARISHA: Okay, that is a 21 and a 22 to hit.

03:12:50.010 --> 03:12:51.076
MATT: Both hit.

03:12:53.508 --> 03:12:54.880
MARISHA: Okay, those are good.

03:12:54.880 --> 03:12:57.663
So 14 damage to the first one

03:13:00.054 --> 03:13:01.379
and Stunning Strike.

03:13:01.379 --> 03:13:02.750
Let me see if I can stun it.

03:13:04.088 --> 03:13:04.921
MATT: 21.

03:13:06.004 --> 03:13:06.962
MARISHA: Yikes.

03:13:08.500 --> 03:13:12.277
Okay, and that is 10 damage to the second one.

03:13:12.277 --> 03:13:14.136
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

03:13:16.501 --> 03:13:18.365
MATT: 20.
SAM: Ugh.

03:13:18.365 --> 03:13:20.883
MARISHA: All right, well,
I'm not fucking with that any more.

03:13:20.883 --> 03:13:22.024
Exactly.

03:13:24.688 --> 03:13:25.771
Fuck.

03:13:25.771 --> 03:13:27.552
TRAVIS: (whoop)
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

03:13:27.552 --> 03:13:28.552
MATT: Go for it.

03:13:32.067 --> 03:13:33.121
A-pop pop!

03:13:33.121 --> 03:13:36.305
Ooh, oh, not as good.

03:13:37.364 --> 03:13:38.538
17 and 18?

03:13:38.538 --> 03:13:39.371
MATT: Both hit.

03:13:39.371 --> 03:13:41.934
MARISHA: Oh, so 17 must be the threshold!

03:13:41.934 --> 03:13:43.059
TALIESIN: It's the threshold.

03:13:45.436 --> 03:13:46.894
MARISHA: Okay.

03:13:48.007 --> 03:13:49.715
That is

03:13:51.741 --> 03:13:54.755
14 and 13 damage.

03:13:54.755 --> 03:13:55.855
Right?

03:13:55.855 --> 03:13:56.688
Seven--

03:13:58.436 --> 03:14:01.975
No, sorry, sorry, 12 and 11.

03:14:01.975 --> 03:14:03.171
That's my bad.

03:14:03.171 --> 03:14:04.229
TRAVIS: It's a good hit.

03:14:05.145 --> 03:14:06.921
MATT: Still a good opening round.

03:14:06.921 --> 03:14:08.407
All right, finish your turn?

03:14:08.407 --> 03:14:10.439
MARISHA: And Extract Aspects, even though

03:14:10.439 --> 03:14:11.877
I think I know what I'm going to get.

03:14:11.877 --> 03:14:12.710
MATT: Indeed.

03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:15.374
It is immune to necrotic and radiant damage.

03:14:15.374 --> 03:14:18.124
MARISHA: Immune to necrotic and radiant.

03:14:19.479 --> 03:14:22.913
So I shout to the others: It's just like the others!

03:14:24.523 --> 03:14:25.831
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn?

03:14:25.831 --> 03:14:26.684
MARISHA: Yep.

03:14:27.717 --> 03:14:28.911
MATT: Caduceus.

03:14:28.911 --> 03:14:30.186
TALIESIN: I'm up?
MATT: You're up.

03:14:31.419 --> 03:14:32.252
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:14:33.719 --> 03:14:35.853
Let's put--

03:14:35.853 --> 03:14:37.361
just because I want to--

03:14:37.361 --> 03:14:39.239
don't want to burn everything quite yet--

03:14:39.239 --> 03:14:43.469
because we're not really fucked, I'm going to--

03:14:43.469 --> 03:14:46.422
How far away am I from Yasha?

03:14:46.422 --> 03:14:47.547
MATT: From Yasha?
TALIESIN: Can I get to, like,

03:14:47.547 --> 03:14:48.671
30 feet from Yasha?

03:14:48.671 --> 03:14:49.671
MATT: You could.

03:14:51.688 --> 03:14:52.938
TALIESIN: Just 30 feet.

03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:57.024
MATT: Would be about there-ish.

03:14:57.024 --> 03:14:59.505
TALIESIN: And will I still have room to move or no?

03:14:59.505 --> 03:15:02.105
MATT: That would be--

03:15:02.105 --> 03:15:03.852
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a run by.
MATT: -- here.

03:15:03.852 --> 03:15:06.020
You can get like 10 feet left if you stay here,

03:15:06.020 --> 03:15:09.202
but that's rough terrain anyway, so.

03:15:09.202 --> 03:15:10.035
TALIESIN: That'll do it--
MATT: There you can do it,

03:15:10.035 --> 03:15:12.403
and five feet left to move.

03:15:12.403 --> 03:15:13.236
TALIESIN: All right.

03:15:13.236 --> 03:15:17.627
I'm going to cast Bless on

03:15:17.627 --> 03:15:21.760
Yasha, Beau, and Veth.

03:15:24.947 --> 03:15:27.697
And I'm going to back up 10 feet.

03:15:28.677 --> 03:15:29.920
MATT: You got it, 10 feet?

03:15:29.920 --> 03:15:32.120
TALIESIN: As far as it'll let me.
SAM: Nice.

03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:33.137
MATT: There you go.

03:15:33.137 --> 03:15:34.449
All right, that finishes your go?

03:15:34.449 --> 03:15:36.338
TALIESIN: That's my go because--

03:15:36.338 --> 03:15:38.141
MATT: That guy's got Sentinel on both sides.

03:15:38.141 --> 03:15:39.860
He's not going anywhere.

03:15:39.860 --> 03:15:41.309
(laughs)

03:15:41.309 --> 03:15:43.222
MARISHA: ♪ Sentinel bitches ♪
ASHLEY: ♪ Sentinel bitches ♪

03:15:43.222 --> 03:15:45.079
MATT: Although technically--

03:15:45.079 --> 03:15:47.412
Hm, I have to look at that--
TALIESIN: It's a level one.

03:15:50.546 --> 03:15:53.429
I don't know if a first-- does a 1st-level spell--

03:15:53.429 --> 03:15:54.274
MATT: No.

03:15:54.274 --> 03:15:55.557
LAURA: Oh yeah, did I have to roll a d20

03:15:55.557 --> 03:15:57.646
even though it got fizzled?
MATT: Yes, you did.

03:15:58.680 --> 03:16:01.337
LAURA: 11.
MATT: 11? You're fine.

03:16:01.337 --> 03:16:04.395
Just double checking something
for my own edification on this.

03:16:04.395 --> 03:16:05.228
TALIESIN: All right.

03:16:05.228 --> 03:16:07.155
TRAVIS: Is it any and all magic?

03:16:07.155 --> 03:16:08.913
LAURA: Anything over level three, I think.

03:16:08.913 --> 03:16:09.746
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:16:17.928 --> 03:16:19.178
MATT: Got it, that's what it was.

03:16:19.178 --> 03:16:20.199
Okay.

03:16:20.199 --> 03:16:21.668
Sorry about that, thank you for waiting.

03:16:21.668 --> 03:16:23.393
All right, that finishes Caduceus' turn.

03:16:23.393 --> 03:16:26.333
Fjord, you're up, with Essek on deck.

03:16:26.333 --> 03:16:30.476
TRAVIS: Am I able to use
my movement to make my way through--

03:16:30.476 --> 03:16:31.867
ASHLEY: ♪ Makin' my way! ♪
TRAVIS: -- that little walkway

03:16:31.867 --> 03:16:33.075
and get into melee range?

03:16:33.075 --> 03:16:35.128
Or is it really congested there?

03:16:35.128 --> 03:16:36.798
MATT: Well, first, I would like you to make

03:16:36.798 --> 03:16:39.492
a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

03:16:39.492 --> 03:16:41.530
MARISHA: With advantage, because
I think we still have Heroes' Feast?

03:16:41.530 --> 03:16:43.913
MATT: You do.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:16:43.913 --> 03:16:45.556
Wisdom saving throw.

03:16:45.556 --> 03:16:46.389
Ooh.

03:16:47.348 --> 03:16:49.119
20, 20!

03:16:49.119 --> 03:16:50.146
MATT: 20.

03:16:50.146 --> 03:16:54.600
The sound of the gnashing
and biting, and-- (discordant noises)

03:16:54.600 --> 03:16:56.756
It like starts fucking with your head,

03:16:56.756 --> 03:16:59.128
but you, ugh, push it off.

03:16:59.128 --> 03:16:59.961
What do you want to do?

03:16:59.961 --> 03:17:01.053
TRAVIS: Oh, cool.
MATT: What was your question?

03:17:01.053 --> 03:17:05.601
TRAVIS: Can I make it up through by the stairs and by Beau?

03:17:05.601 --> 03:17:06.434
MATT: You could--

03:17:06.434 --> 03:17:08.293
Beau is right on the corner there,

03:17:08.293 --> 03:17:09.616
you could get into melee with it,

03:17:09.616 --> 03:17:11.829
but it will be considered having half-cover

03:17:11.829 --> 03:17:14.705
because of the platform is in the way.

03:17:14.705 --> 03:17:17.639
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. Oh, so I couldn't use my 30 feet to walk

03:17:17.639 --> 03:17:19.458
all the way up through and get over here?

03:17:19.458 --> 03:17:21.015
MATT: Up over, through here on this side?

03:17:21.015 --> 03:17:21.848
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:17:22.856 --> 03:17:23.689
TALIESIN: Dangerous.

03:17:23.689 --> 03:17:26.348
MATT: At 30, you could get on that side, if you want to.

03:17:26.348 --> 03:17:28.171
TRAVIS: ♪ That girl is dangerous ♪

03:17:28.171 --> 03:17:29.590
Actually, I'll stay back where I am,

03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:33.331
and I'll arc over here behind Jester

03:17:33.331 --> 03:17:35.122
just for this one to see how this pans out

03:17:35.122 --> 03:17:38.288
for a second and I'll send three Eldritch Blasts its way.

03:17:38.288 --> 03:17:39.524
MATT: Okay, so as you're walking through,

03:17:39.524 --> 03:17:41.342
you're just like-- (zapping)

03:17:41.342 --> 03:17:42.349
Go for it.

03:17:43.490 --> 03:17:47.623
TRAVIS: First one is a...

03:17:47.623 --> 03:17:49.040
17 to hit?
MATT: Hits.

03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:49.998
TRAVIS: Great.

03:17:51.181 --> 03:17:52.672
That's a 15.

03:17:52.672 --> 03:17:54.052
MATT: Misses.

03:17:54.052 --> 03:17:56.046
TRAVIS: And a 20.
MATT: Two hits.

03:17:56.046 --> 03:17:57.321
TRAVIS: Awesome.
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

03:18:00.363 --> 03:18:02.778
TRAVIS: That's 12 points of force damage.

03:18:02.778 --> 03:18:04.247
MATT: Nice.

03:18:05.924 --> 03:18:06.975
TRAVIS: Six, five--

03:18:06.975 --> 03:18:09.591
And 11 points of force damage.

03:18:09.591 --> 03:18:10.424
MATT: Great.

03:18:10.424 --> 03:18:11.509
TRAVIS: Don't need to roll a d20 for those, right,

03:18:11.509 --> 03:18:13.192
for Eldritch Blasts?

03:18:13.192 --> 03:18:15.118
MATT: No, you do not.

03:18:15.118 --> 03:18:17.676
It is a lower level magic and does not

03:18:17.676 --> 03:18:21.234
quite hit the strange magic level.

03:18:21.234 --> 03:18:22.176
TRAVIS: Amazing, okay.

03:18:22.176 --> 03:18:23.159
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn?

03:18:23.159 --> 03:18:25.300
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: All right, now it's Essek's turn.

03:18:25.300 --> 03:18:26.654
TRAVIS: Actually, I'll use my bonus action

03:18:26.654 --> 03:18:28.379
to cast Hexblade's Curse on it.

03:18:28.379 --> 03:18:30.170
MATT: Hexblade's Curse on it?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:18:30.170 --> 03:18:32.174
LAURA: Does this thing have eyes?

03:18:32.174 --> 03:18:33.281
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:18:33.281 --> 03:18:34.923
LAURA: It does?
MATT: Just on the head.

03:18:34.923 --> 03:18:36.005
The rest are just mouths.

03:18:36.005 --> 03:18:37.813
LAURA: Oh god.
SAM: Ew.

03:18:37.813 --> 03:18:40.937
MARISHA: We also had to do
wisdom saves on the Laughing Hand.

03:18:40.937 --> 03:18:42.128
LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:42.128 --> 03:18:43.748
It's the same sort of--
MARISHA: It's the same.

03:18:43.748 --> 03:18:46.222
LAURA: It's just not laughter, it's creepy sounds.

03:18:46.222 --> 03:18:47.161
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:18:47.161 --> 03:18:49.569
Hexblade's Curse on that creature, that finishes your turn.

03:18:49.569 --> 03:18:51.227
LIAM: Same family tree, maybe.
MATT: Essek's go.

03:18:52.428 --> 03:18:53.536
Essek...

03:18:55.050 --> 03:19:00.050
MARISHA: Like someone who
finds old schematics for something.

03:19:00.126 --> 03:19:01.672
MATT: Thank god for that Heroes' Feast.

03:19:01.672 --> 03:19:05.179
Essek resists the gnashing sounds and is like, "Ah!"

03:19:06.137 --> 03:19:08.336
He's going to go ahead and--

03:19:08.336 --> 03:19:10.578
everyone's clustered in there.

03:19:14.965 --> 03:19:17.715
(hands drumming)

03:19:19.585 --> 03:19:22.068
You know, everyone's in that space right there.

03:19:22.068 --> 03:19:23.401
He's going to--

03:19:24.761 --> 03:19:27.260
He's going to cast a Magic Missile at 3rd-level

03:19:27.260 --> 03:19:29.918
just because he doesn't want to hit anybody else with stuff.

03:19:31.742 --> 03:19:34.517
TALIESIN: (whooshing)

03:19:38.266 --> 03:19:39.791
TRAVIS: This thing's nasty.

03:19:41.867 --> 03:19:44.921
SAM: ♪ (sings with background music) ♪

03:19:44.921 --> 03:19:46.556
MATT: 16 points of force damage to it.

03:19:46.556 --> 03:19:48.660
Not great rolls, necessarily.

03:19:48.660 --> 03:19:50.618
And he's going to go ahead and step back

03:19:50.618 --> 03:19:53.878
this way to try and get out of that gnashing sound.

03:19:53.878 --> 03:19:55.456
That finishes his turn.

03:19:55.456 --> 03:20:00.148
That brings us to Caleb with Veth on deck.

03:20:00.148 --> 03:20:01.120
LIAM: I'm going to keep this simple

03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:03.944
because I do not want to blow all my reserves.

03:20:03.944 --> 03:20:06.968
I'm just going to throw a Fire Bolt at him.

03:20:06.968 --> 03:20:08.683
MATT: All right.

03:20:08.683 --> 03:20:10.034
He does-- from where you're standing right now,

03:20:10.034 --> 03:20:11.628
he does have half cover.

03:20:11.628 --> 03:20:15.640
LIAM: Well, I will step diagonally forward and to my left.

03:20:15.640 --> 03:20:16.861
That should clear that up.

03:20:16.861 --> 03:20:18.261
MATT: That does indeed right there.

03:20:18.261 --> 03:20:21.419
LIAM: Okay.
ASHLEY: Guys, what if that's a base jump?

03:20:21.419 --> 03:20:23.832
(laughter)

03:20:23.832 --> 03:20:25.949
TALIESIN: Wow.
ASHLEY: We'd just float down.

03:20:25.949 --> 03:20:27.736
LIAM: That's a 24 to hit.
TRAVIS: Check it out.

03:20:27.736 --> 03:20:28.569
MATT: 24 hits.

03:20:30.481 --> 03:20:31.747
LIAM: Four--
TRAVIS: That'd be great.

03:20:31.747 --> 03:20:32.922
MARISHA: Little campaign one callback.

03:20:32.922 --> 03:20:33.755
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:20:33.755 --> 03:20:36.309
LIAM: 13 points of fire damage.
MARISHA: Pre-stream.

03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:37.392
MATT: You got it.

03:20:39.320 --> 03:20:41.184
LIAM: I'm actually going to go back to where I started

03:20:41.184 --> 03:20:44.099
and even a little bit further into the doorway.

03:20:44.099 --> 03:20:45.226
MATT: Okay, about there?

03:20:45.226 --> 03:20:46.593
LIAM: Yep, that's good.

03:20:46.593 --> 03:20:49.016
MATT: You got it, finishing Caleb's go.
Veth, you're up, Jester you're on deck.

03:20:49.016 --> 03:20:50.499
SAM: Oh, again? All right.

03:20:50.499 --> 03:20:51.332
MATT: At the top of your turn, I need you to make

03:20:51.332 --> 03:20:53.682
a wisdom saving throw, as even while blocked from the path,

03:20:53.682 --> 03:20:57.131
you can still hear the sound of those mouths gnashing.
TALIESIN: You also have a d4 add to that.

03:20:57.131 --> 03:20:59.589
SAM: Don't need it. But do I just get it?

03:20:59.589 --> 03:21:00.880
TALIESIN: You get it.

03:21:00.880 --> 03:21:03.713
LIAM: Wait, can I actually put him
right back where he started?

03:21:03.713 --> 03:21:05.475
Not into the doorway?
MATT: If you want to.

03:21:05.475 --> 03:21:06.875
LIAM: Yes, please.

03:21:06.875 --> 03:21:08.466
SAM: 25...

03:21:09.449 --> 03:21:11.074
to save.

03:21:12.908 --> 03:21:17.079
I assume I make my save, so I will run around--

03:21:17.079 --> 03:21:17.912
MATT: You do.

03:21:17.912 --> 03:21:19.720
And actually, technically I need you to make

03:21:19.720 --> 03:21:22.709
a wisdom saving throw for me as well.

03:21:22.709 --> 03:21:25.877
Because you are just in that radius.

03:21:25.877 --> 03:21:27.194
Actually, no, you are fine, you are fine.

03:21:27.194 --> 03:21:30.427
LIAM: Okay, it was a 28.
MATT: No worries, you're good.

03:21:30.427 --> 03:21:32.927
SAM: I will run around the corner

03:21:34.464 --> 03:21:37.364
and take my brand new...

03:21:38.972 --> 03:21:43.355
Brenatto's Futuristic--

03:21:43.355 --> 03:21:44.909
TRAVIS: Stark bow?

03:21:44.909 --> 03:21:46.092
SAM: Yep, that.

03:21:46.092 --> 03:21:49.160
(laughs) And try to fire it.

03:21:49.160 --> 03:21:50.814
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll an attack.

03:21:50.814 --> 03:21:52.324
Add your dexterity modifier.

03:21:52.324 --> 03:21:53.799
LIAM: The Brenatt-Bow.

03:21:53.799 --> 03:21:54.907
TRAVIS: Let's go.
LAURA: Do it!

03:21:54.907 --> 03:21:57.136
MARISHA: The Brenatt-Bow!

03:21:57.136 --> 03:21:59.677
TALIESIN: You also add a d4 to that.
SAM: Oh, thank you.

03:22:00.676 --> 03:22:01.901
MARISHA: Got to clear 17.

03:22:01.901 --> 03:22:03.560
SAM: 16.
MARISHA: Aw.

03:22:03.560 --> 03:22:05.376
MATT: (whooshing) Just goes wide.

03:22:05.376 --> 03:22:07.375
It does (whooshing) and release it

03:22:07.375 --> 03:22:08.726
and it just shoots off

03:22:08.726 --> 03:22:11.152
and impacts into the far stone.

03:22:11.152 --> 03:22:16.152
SAM: Can I hot swap and shoot
the other one as a bonus action?

03:22:16.308 --> 03:22:17.434
MATT: I'll allow it, sure.

03:22:17.434 --> 03:22:19.578
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Hot swap.

03:22:19.578 --> 03:22:20.449
LIAM: Only because you used that word.

03:22:20.449 --> 03:22:23.524

TALIESIN: Add the d--

03:22:23.524 --> 03:22:25.158
SAM: Plus three!
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:22:25.158 --> 03:22:29.336
MATT: That hits. That hits.
(laughter)

03:22:29.336 --> 03:22:30.974
SAM: Ah, sneak attack!

03:22:30.974 --> 03:22:31.912
MATT: Yeah.

03:22:31.912 --> 03:22:35.260
SAM: This doesn't seem very sneaky, but sure.
MATT: In melee with Yasha and Beauregard.

03:22:35.260 --> 03:22:36.351
SAM: Okay.

03:22:38.387 --> 03:22:39.220
10,

MATT: 26 points of damage, heck yeah.

03:22:48.459 --> 03:22:49.292
All righty.

03:22:49.292 --> 03:22:51.771
SAM: And I'm going to keep running as far as I can

03:22:51.771 --> 03:22:54.406
towards Yasha and beyond, if I can.

03:22:54.406 --> 03:22:55.239
MATT: Okay.

03:22:56.886 --> 03:22:59.086
30 is your movement?
SAM: Uh-huh.

03:22:59.086 --> 03:23:00.035
MATT: That's as far as you can get right there.

03:23:00.035 --> 03:23:01.590
SAM: Oh no, okay.

03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:03.345

MATT: Jester, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

03:23:06.853 --> 03:23:10.157
LAURA: Okay, well, all of
my spells are radiant and necrotic,

03:23:10.157 --> 03:23:13.158
and anything that isn't that, he can cancel.

03:23:13.158 --> 03:23:16.144
So, (laughs) um.

03:23:16.144 --> 03:23:19.552
I'm going to take out my Wand of Smiles,

03:23:19.552 --> 03:23:21.606
and point it right at all his mouths,

03:23:21.606 --> 03:23:22.874
and I'm going to use it.

TALIESIN: I mean.
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:23:24.179 --> 03:23:27.202
MARISHA: Honestly, what if it
just does something crazy, though?

03:23:27.202 --> 03:23:28.727
TALIESIN: It's not--
TRAVIS: That's a shitload of mouths.

03:23:28.727 --> 03:23:29.910

LAURA: It's a 12.

03:23:52.589 --> 03:23:54.049
I know, I wanted it to fail,

03:23:54.049 --> 03:23:54.907
I wanted it to fail.

03:23:54.907 --> 03:23:56.974
ASHLEY: Ah, such a good idea.
MATT: I'll say it hits,

03:23:56.974 --> 03:23:58.441
and you watch as two of the mouths,

03:23:58.441 --> 03:24:01.016

LIAM: A bulette?

03:25:09.844 --> 03:25:10.752
because this doesn't exist.

between the plates of armor.

03:25:23.234 --> 03:25:24.546
Where its head would be,

03:25:24.546 --> 03:25:26.735
you just see a circular mouth filled with teeth

03:25:26.735 --> 03:25:29.156

03:25:33.860 --> 03:25:35.662
TRAVIS: God, what the fuck, man?

03:25:35.662 --> 03:25:37.907
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool, cool.

03:25:37.907 --> 03:25:39.931
MARISHA: The cinematic moment is very funny, though.

03:25:39.931 --> 03:25:40.914
Like--

03:25:45.035 --> 03:25:46.702
TRAVIS: Kill it with fire!

03:25:48.685 --> 03:25:51.542
MATT: There we go.
LAURA: Yep, yep, yep, yep.

03:25:51.542 --> 03:25:52.625
MATT: Now that--

03:25:54.155 --> 03:25:57.055
Okay, not the best--

03:25:58.035 --> 03:25:59.618
ASHLEY: Detective agency.

03:26:01.060 --> 03:26:01.893
MATT: Got it. All right.

03:26:01.893 --> 03:26:04.836
So that finishes your turn, Jester.

03:26:04.836 --> 03:26:05.802
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:26:05.802 --> 03:26:07.460
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

03:26:07.460 --> 03:26:09.034
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to try to break out

03:26:09.034 --> 03:26:13.333
of this grapple business.

03:26:13.333 --> 03:26:14.433
MATT: Okay.

03:26:14.433 --> 03:26:15.733
Just so you know, all grapple does is

03:26:15.733 --> 03:26:17.981
it prevents you from moving.

03:26:17.981 --> 03:26:19.949
ASHLEY: Copy. I'm just going to start swinging.

03:26:19.949 --> 03:26:20.782
MATT: Okay, well, first thing,

03:26:20.782 --> 03:26:21.729
make a wisdom saving throw for me.

03:26:21.729 --> 03:26:22.820
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: With advantage.

03:26:22.820 --> 03:26:24.361
TRAVIS: (gibbering)
TALIESIN: And a d4.

03:26:25.843 --> 03:26:26.842
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

03:26:26.842 --> 03:26:28.424
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:26:28.424 --> 03:26:29.407
SAM: Get it.

03:26:29.407 --> 03:26:31.693
TALIESIN: All your attacks have a d4 right now.

03:26:31.693 --> 03:26:33.877
ASHLEY: (exhales) Okay. Okay. Good to know.

03:26:33.877 --> 03:26:34.985
MATT: So you're good, you're good.

03:26:34.985 --> 03:26:35.818
ASHLEY: So--

03:26:35.818 --> 03:26:37.676
TRAVIS: And advantage because you're-- no, never mind.

03:26:37.676 --> 03:26:39.938
LIAM: Kill it.
TRAVIS: I'm going to shut up.

03:26:39.938 --> 03:26:40.896
ASHLEY: Reckless.

03:26:41.800 --> 03:26:42.825
TRAVIS: Mm!

03:26:42.825 --> 03:26:44.506
LIAM: Guys, I just saw the alien out here

03:26:44.506 --> 03:26:46.727
and it fucking terrified me!

03:26:46.727 --> 03:26:48.886
(laughter)

03:26:48.886 --> 03:26:50.168
ASHLEY: 27?

03:26:50.168 --> 03:26:53.648
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:26:53.648 --> 03:26:54.939
Let's go with these guys.

03:26:57.126 --> 03:26:57.959
Ooh!

03:27:01.009 --> 03:27:01.842
LAURA: Where'd the music go?

03:27:01.842 --> 03:27:02.941
MARISHA: Yeah, where'd it go?

03:27:02.941 --> 03:27:05.210
MATT: It should be playing.
SAM: ♪ (imitates battle music) ♪

03:27:05.210 --> 03:27:06.049
TRAVIS: The two laughing mouths.

03:27:06.049 --> 03:27:06.882
MATT: I think it's just--

03:27:06.882 --> 03:27:09.323
this is a low track.
MARISHA: This is the lead in.

03:27:09.323 --> 03:27:11.490
TALIESIN: Oh, there it is.
MARISHA: There it goes, there it goes.

03:27:12.773 --> 03:27:16.381
ASHLEY: 35 points of damage for the first hit.

03:27:16.381 --> 03:27:18.060
MATT: Take away the radiant, if you don't mind.

03:27:18.060 --> 03:27:20.591
ASHLEY: Seven. So yeah.

03:27:20.591 --> 03:27:22.273
MATT: Well, and the additional d6, too, don't forget.

03:27:22.273 --> 03:27:23.190
Because that's radiant as well.

03:27:23.190 --> 03:27:25.223
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, you're right. Okay.

03:27:28.940 --> 03:27:30.523
Should I just roll again?

03:27:31.886 --> 03:27:33.602
MATT: Well, it's just the additional d6

03:27:33.602 --> 03:27:34.960
that is the radiant on this.

03:27:34.960 --> 03:27:37.405
ASHLEY: Okay, so there was-- I should have--

03:27:37.405 --> 03:27:39.016
TRAVIS: 35 minus seven, 28.

03:27:39.016 --> 03:27:41.294
And then your d6 was--

03:27:41.294 --> 03:27:43.544
MATT: Well, you're not doing extra radiant damage

03:27:43.544 --> 03:27:45.310
beyond the extra d6, or is it--?

03:27:45.310 --> 03:27:47.046
You're rolling an additional-- sorry.
ASHLEY: The Divine Fury.

03:27:47.046 --> 03:27:48.847
MATT: The Divine Fury is an additional how much damage?

03:27:48.847 --> 03:27:50.493
on the first attack? It's extra 3d6?

03:27:50.493 --> 03:27:54.384
ASHLEY: It's an extra d6, one extra d6 on top.

03:27:54.384 --> 03:27:57.253
MATT: Correct. So that's all that doesn't go through.

03:27:57.253 --> 03:27:58.458
ASHLEY: That's all that doesn't go through.

03:27:58.458 --> 03:27:59.808
MATT: So that's the radiant bit.

03:27:59.808 --> 03:28:03.186
ASHLEY: So we'll just do six because I-- yeah.

03:28:03.186 --> 03:28:04.740
MATT: Okay. So--
ASHLEY: Just minus six.

03:28:04.740 --> 03:28:06.315
Yeah, because I rolled really well.

03:28:08.665 --> 03:28:10.258
Okay, second hit.

03:28:10.258 --> 03:28:11.748
MATT: Roll for an attack, still reckless.

03:28:11.748 --> 03:28:13.165
ASHLEY: Still reckless.

03:28:15.951 --> 03:28:17.017
Okay.

03:28:18.426 --> 03:28:19.683
22.

03:28:19.683 --> 03:28:21.351
MATT: 22 hits, yeah.

03:28:21.351 --> 03:28:22.184
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:28:25.214 --> 03:28:26.805
Nope, just two.

03:28:28.434 --> 03:28:30.216
Nice.

03:28:30.216 --> 03:28:33.407
SAM: (whistling)

03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:38.430
ASHLEY: 17.

03:28:38.430 --> 03:28:40.793
MATT: 17 damage, nice.
ASHLEY: 17 damage.

03:28:40.793 --> 03:28:42.425
MATT: It's looking pretty hurt.

03:28:42.425 --> 03:28:43.892
LAURA: That's good.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:28:46.108 --> 03:28:48.069
And as a bonus action--

03:28:48.069 --> 03:28:49.244
MATT: Yeah?

03:28:49.244 --> 03:28:51.493
ASHLEY: I would like to

03:28:53.185 --> 03:28:54.679
battle cry.

03:28:54.679 --> 03:28:55.512
MARISHA: Ooh.

03:28:55.512 --> 03:28:56.885
ASHLEY: Which gives everybody advantage

03:28:56.885 --> 03:28:58.437
on attack rolls and saving throws.

03:28:58.437 --> 03:29:00.613
MATT: For one round, all righty.

03:29:00.613 --> 03:29:02.291
TRAVIS: Nice. Good use.
MATT: You've got it.

03:29:02.291 --> 03:29:03.649
LAURA: Is it everybody who could see you?

03:29:03.649 --> 03:29:04.482
Everybody within--

03:29:04.482 --> 03:29:05.668
ASHLEY: Everybody--

03:29:05.668 --> 03:29:07.967
MATT: Who can hear you, I think.
ASHLEY: 10 other creatures

03:29:07.967 --> 03:29:10.033
of my choice within 60 feet,

03:29:10.033 --> 03:29:11.918
that can hear you, yes.

03:29:11.918 --> 03:29:13.630
MATT: Yep. So that would be you as well.

03:29:13.630 --> 03:29:14.496
TALIESIN: That's everybody.
MATT: That's all of them.

03:29:14.496 --> 03:29:15.582
TRAVIS: What's it sound like?

03:29:15.582 --> 03:29:17.511
ASHLEY: (roars)

03:29:17.511 --> 03:29:18.636
TRAVIS: (gargling yell)

03:29:18.636 --> 03:29:19.910
MATT: I dig it. (laughs)

03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:21.465
TALIESIN: Worth it. It's all worth it.

03:29:21.465 --> 03:29:22.909
MATT: All righty, that finishes Yasha's go.

03:29:22.909 --> 03:29:26.823
It is now the central creature's turn right there.

03:29:26.823 --> 03:29:29.309
Angrily, as it's starting to take the hits,

03:29:29.309 --> 03:29:32.116
it's going to attempt to just go all in on you, Yasha.

03:29:32.116 --> 03:29:34.489
You're the one who's drawn its attention.

03:29:34.489 --> 03:29:36.293
Plus, it has advantage on its attacks

03:29:36.293 --> 03:29:38.486
because you were reckless.

03:29:40.180 --> 03:29:42.368
Ooh, okay, that'll be a 27 hit?

03:29:42.368 --> 03:29:43.306
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:29:43.306 --> 03:29:44.364
MATT: The first claw--
TRAVIS: Wouldn't he

03:29:44.364 --> 03:29:45.854
reward being reckless?

03:29:45.854 --> 03:29:48.074
MATT: Second claw is 21 to hit.

03:29:48.074 --> 03:29:48.907
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:29:48.907 --> 03:29:50.170
MATT: And the bite...

03:29:52.379 --> 03:29:53.241
is a natural 20.

03:29:53.241 --> 03:29:55.263
LIAM: Oh no, no, no.
TALIESIN: Cancel.

03:29:55.263 --> 03:29:57.298
MARISHA: Oh yeah, cancel that shit, cancel that shit.

03:29:57.298 --> 03:29:58.461
LAURA: Oh no.

03:29:58.461 --> 03:30:00.340
MATT: Yeah, you're within 30 feet, there you go, boom.

03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:01.599
Canceled.

03:30:01.599 --> 03:30:03.424
Regular hit.
LAURA: Good to know.

03:30:03.424 --> 03:30:05.355
MATT: Yeah, about there.

03:30:05.355 --> 03:30:06.210
Well done.

03:30:06.210 --> 03:30:07.881
TALIESIN: Undo that shit.

03:30:07.881 --> 03:30:09.364
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh my god.
MARISHA: I can't get Sentinel

03:30:09.364 --> 03:30:10.994
because she has Sentinel.

03:30:10.994 --> 03:30:13.902
MATT: All right. The first claw against you, Yasha,

03:30:15.461 --> 03:30:18.053
is 10 points of slashing damage,

03:30:18.053 --> 03:30:18.993
reduced to five.

03:30:18.993 --> 03:30:20.529
TRAVIS: When you have Sentinel, if they hit somebody else,

03:30:20.529 --> 03:30:21.831
can't you hit them?

03:30:21.831 --> 03:30:25.556
MATT: Plus 11 points of force damage.
MARISHA: Unless the other person also has Sentinel.

03:30:25.556 --> 03:30:26.790
LIAM: Yeah.

03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:29.542
MARISHA: That's the only bitch of this.

03:30:29.542 --> 03:30:31.326
MATT: You lock them down, but you don't get to use that bit.

03:30:31.326 --> 03:30:32.159
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:30:32.159 --> 03:30:34.966
MATT: Second claw strike against you is

03:30:34.966 --> 03:30:37.270
nine points of slashing damage reduced to four.

03:30:37.270 --> 03:30:39.412
MARISHA: I know, we're too alike.

03:30:39.412 --> 03:30:41.687
MATT: Plus 10 points of force damage.

03:30:41.687 --> 03:30:45.046
MARISHA: She's too toxic, I just can't.

03:30:45.046 --> 03:30:49.539
MATT: And the bite strike is trying to pull

03:30:49.539 --> 03:30:52.014
a whole section of your throat and chest out.

03:30:52.014 --> 03:30:54.699
It sinks in and tries to tear back,

03:30:54.699 --> 03:30:57.474
pulling part of your rib cage with it,

03:30:57.474 --> 03:31:00.082
it's hoping.
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:31:00.082 --> 03:31:01.456
SAM: Joke's on that thing.

03:31:01.456 --> 03:31:03.199
TRAVIS: You got plenty of ribs.
SAM: She doesn't have a ribcage.

03:31:03.199 --> 03:31:04.760
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:06.479
There's a lot of them.

03:31:06.479 --> 03:31:07.679
Dolly Parton got rid of a few.

03:31:07.679 --> 03:31:08.570
SAM: She had them surgically removed--

03:31:08.570 --> 03:31:10.645
MATT: 16 points--
SAM: -- for her figure.

03:31:10.645 --> 03:31:13.527
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage reduced to eight.

03:31:13.527 --> 03:31:15.360
ASHLEY: Okay, just snatch that waist.

03:31:15.360 --> 03:31:16.437
LAURA: I'm so skinny.

03:31:16.437 --> 03:31:19.121
MATT: Ooh. 18 points of force damage.

03:31:19.121 --> 03:31:20.722
ASHLEY: Oh shit.
TALIESIN: How are you doing?

03:31:20.722 --> 03:31:22.440
ASHLEY: Well, let's see here.

03:31:22.440 --> 03:31:23.831
LAURA: A little rough?

03:31:23.831 --> 03:31:25.587
ASHLEY: I mean, not awful, but--

03:31:25.587 --> 03:31:27.590
SAM: She's a tank, she's fine.

03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:30.109
ASHLEY: You know, we're in the 40s.

03:31:30.109 --> 03:31:32.689
SAM: We got a rejuvenation machine like 10 feet away.

03:31:32.689 --> 03:31:33.880
She'll be fine.

03:31:33.880 --> 03:31:34.942
MATT: All right.

03:31:34.942 --> 03:31:36.683
That finishes its go.

03:31:36.683 --> 03:31:39.138
Now it is Beau's go with Caduceus on deck. What you got?

03:31:39.138 --> 03:31:42.647
MARISHA: All right, just enraged by hearing my girlfriend

03:31:42.647 --> 03:31:46.175
let out a blood-curdling scream--
SAM: Oh, it's official now?

03:31:46.175 --> 03:31:49.072
MARISHA: -- and watching-- Hell yeah, man, of course.

03:31:49.072 --> 03:31:52.738
We're doing PDA, it's like a thing.

03:31:52.738 --> 03:31:54.717
TALIESIN: It's advantage and a d4 right now?

03:31:54.717 --> 03:31:57.050
MARISHA: Advantage and an extra d4. So.

03:31:59.012 --> 03:32:00.095
Pop-pop.

03:32:01.345 --> 03:32:04.191
Just digging into this guy.

03:32:04.191 --> 03:32:05.556
ASHLEY: Probably shouldn't do reckless

03:32:05.556 --> 03:32:07.563
when you're standing in front of the creature.

03:32:07.563 --> 03:32:10.918
MARISHA: 24 plus a d4. 25 for the first hit?

03:32:10.918 --> 03:32:11.996
MATT: That hits.

03:32:11.996 --> 03:32:13.491
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and do the second hit.

03:32:13.491 --> 03:32:15.100
MATT: That's fine. Just make sure you hit him

03:32:15.100 --> 03:32:16.440
is the important part.

03:32:16.440 --> 03:32:17.924
MARISHA: And then 23--

03:32:17.924 --> 03:32:20.391
MATT: That hits.
MARISHA: Plus a d4

03:32:20.391 --> 03:32:21.982
for the second hit.

03:32:23.741 --> 03:32:28.241
Okay, for these two hits. Ooh, yucky.

03:32:28.241 --> 03:32:31.663
14 damage on the first one. Eight damage on the second one.

03:32:31.663 --> 03:32:32.796
MATT: Okay. Before we do that, could you

03:32:32.796 --> 03:32:34.360
roll a wisdom saving throw for me, please?

03:32:34.360 --> 03:32:35.689
MARISHA: Yes, I can.
MATT: With advantage.

03:32:35.689 --> 03:32:37.111
TALIESIN and MATT: And a d4.

03:32:37.111 --> 03:32:38.135
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:32:38.135 --> 03:32:39.611
MATT: There's very little chance you don't make this

03:32:39.611 --> 03:32:40.645
because of all these stacking--

03:32:40.645 --> 03:32:41.639
TRAVIS: Don't curse her like that!

03:32:41.639 --> 03:32:42.731
MARISHA: I know, right?

03:32:42.731 --> 03:32:46.590
That is a natural 19, though, for 28, plus--

03:32:47.535 --> 03:32:49.081
MATT: You're fine. Continue the rest of your turn.

03:32:49.081 --> 03:32:50.989
You have a bonus action.

03:32:50.989 --> 03:32:52.934
MARISHA: Bonus action, Flurry of Blows.

03:32:52.934 --> 03:32:54.444
MATT: Go for it. Two more strikes.

03:32:54.444 --> 03:32:57.699
MARISHA: First one is a natural 16, so that hits.

03:32:57.699 --> 03:32:58.745
MATT: Yep.

03:32:58.745 --> 03:33:01.765
MARISHA: Second one is a 10 for a 22, plus a d4.

03:33:01.765 --> 03:33:04.459
MATT: That hits. Damage two more times.

03:33:04.459 --> 03:33:06.017
MARISHA: So that is--

03:33:06.017 --> 03:33:06.850
MATT: Monks, man.

03:33:06.850 --> 03:33:10.015
MARISHA: Ooh, ooh, ooh, 14 damage and 15 damage.

03:33:10.015 --> 03:33:11.540
ASHLEY: Avenge me.

03:33:11.540 --> 03:33:13.908
MATT: Nice. He's getting real hurt.

03:33:13.908 --> 03:33:15.664
MARISHA: (groans)

03:33:15.664 --> 03:33:16.499
Okay.

03:33:16.499 --> 03:33:17.847
MATT: It's all good.

03:33:17.847 --> 03:33:19.340
That finishes your turn?

03:33:19.340 --> 03:33:23.509
MARISHA: Yeah, can I shuffle around towards the--

03:33:23.509 --> 03:33:24.343
LIAM: Buffalo?

03:33:24.343 --> 03:33:25.285
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:33:26.744 --> 03:33:31.263
(laughs) Towards where Yasha and Veth are

03:33:31.263 --> 03:33:32.943
and start making--
MATT: Yeah, this is rough terrain--

03:33:32.943 --> 03:33:34.177
MARISHA: ♪ Making my way ♪
MATT: But you have plenty of movement,

03:33:34.177 --> 03:33:36.357
so you can definitely do that without a major issue.

03:33:36.357 --> 03:33:37.319
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

03:33:37.319 --> 03:33:39.801
That finishes your go.
MARISHA: Yep.

03:33:39.801 --> 03:33:41.305
MATT: That brings us to Caduceus.

03:33:41.305 --> 03:33:42.138
Your turn.
MARISHA: Kill it!

03:33:42.138 --> 03:33:43.200
ASHLEY: Kill it.
MATT: Fjord, you're on deck.

03:33:43.200 --> 03:33:45.491
TRAVIS: Okay, and just making sure that the bulette creature

03:33:45.491 --> 03:33:48.918
gets a turn at-- not when Edward Scissorhands goes?

03:33:48.918 --> 03:33:49.814
MATT: It's in the initiative.

03:33:49.814 --> 03:33:50.677
LAURA: We only have radiant.
TRAVIS: Got it.

03:33:50.677 --> 03:33:52.023
MATT: But it did not roll high initiative.

03:33:52.023 --> 03:33:53.106
TRAVIS: Okay, copy.

03:33:54.765 --> 03:33:57.090
TALIESIN: Yeah. I honestly don't think--

03:33:57.090 --> 03:33:58.198
MATT: Essek is before it.
TALIESIN: I have anything that can

03:33:58.198 --> 03:33:59.322
actually hurt it.

03:34:01.489 --> 03:34:02.714
SAM: You have your axe.

03:34:02.714 --> 03:34:04.188
LIAM: Handaxe, yeah.

03:34:04.188 --> 03:34:05.590
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't have
anything to hurt this thing with.

03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:07.033
MARISHA: Maybe heal Yash.

03:34:07.033 --> 03:34:07.974
SAM: Under "Equipment."

03:34:07.974 --> 03:34:09.990
TALIESIN: (nervous noise)

03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.916
MARISHA: Or just, you know--

03:34:10.916 --> 03:34:13.225
TALIESIN: I've got another idea.
MARISHA: Or just chill.

03:34:13.225 --> 03:34:15.140
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
MARISHA: Save your shit.

03:34:15.140 --> 03:34:17.062
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek around the corner to see

03:34:17.062 --> 03:34:18.181
and back up against the wall

03:34:18.181 --> 03:34:20.170
to see what the hell Jester's dealing with?

03:34:20.170 --> 03:34:21.734
MATT: Over here, you mean?

03:34:21.734 --> 03:34:22.976
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:34:22.976 --> 03:34:24.705
MATT: Okay. As you go against
the wall, that's your movement.

03:34:24.705 --> 03:34:26.798
You turn around, you see Jester

03:34:26.798 --> 03:34:30.863
stepping back as this giant flesh-armored tongue creature

03:34:30.863 --> 03:34:34.699
is now (snarling) towards her.

03:34:34.699 --> 03:34:36.677
TALIESIN: Oh no. Banishment.

03:34:36.677 --> 03:34:38.785
SAM: Oh.
MATT: Banishment. Nice.

03:34:38.785 --> 03:34:40.026
All righty. The range on that is?

03:34:40.026 --> 03:34:40.976
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

03:34:40.976 --> 03:34:42.326
MATT: It's plenty there.

03:34:42.326 --> 03:34:43.342
All righty.

03:34:44.787 --> 03:34:47.487
It does have magic resistance, so it has advantage on.

03:34:47.487 --> 03:34:48.444
And that is a what save?

03:34:48.444 --> 03:34:49.456
TALIESIN: Charisma.

03:34:49.456 --> 03:34:51.773
MATT: Charisma. Okay.

03:34:51.773 --> 03:34:53.039
Not good for the first one.

03:34:54.947 --> 03:34:56.229
17?
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:58.680
MATT: (laughs)

03:34:58.680 --> 03:35:00.959
SAM: Gone.
MATT: (snarling)

03:35:00.959 --> 03:35:02.193
(whooshing)

03:35:02.193 --> 03:35:03.793
SAM: Nice!
LAURA: (startled noise)

03:35:04.634 --> 03:35:06.237
TALIESIN: I don't know how long I can hold this,

03:35:06.237 --> 03:35:08.864
so let's get out of here real soon.

03:35:08.864 --> 03:35:11.614
MATT: Yeah, it is banished.

03:35:12.652 --> 03:35:14.051
MARISHA: ♪ B-b-b-banished. ♪
LAURA: Thank you.

03:35:14.051 --> 03:35:16.687
LIAM: Hoo.
TALIESIN: We got a minute. (laughing)

03:35:16.687 --> 03:35:19.986
MARISHA: All right, let's kill this other thing.

03:35:19.986 --> 03:35:23.540
MATT: All righty. That finishes Caduceus' go.

03:35:23.540 --> 03:35:25.356
Fjord, you're up.

03:35:25.356 --> 03:35:27.355
TRAVIS: Well, now that the dangerous puppy dog is gone,

03:35:27.355 --> 03:35:30.463
I'll use Relentless Hex to teleport 30 feet

03:35:30.463 --> 03:35:33.987
to the target of my Hexblade's Curse,

03:35:33.987 --> 03:35:35.199
putting me right up on it.

03:35:35.199 --> 03:35:37.490
MATT: You're so lucky.

03:35:37.490 --> 03:35:38.620
SAM: Lucky?
LAURA: Whoosh, whoosh.

03:35:38.620 --> 03:35:39.873
MATT: You don't even know. Continue.

03:35:39.873 --> 03:35:40.740
MARISHA: What?
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:42.865
I need to make a wisdom thing, right?

03:35:42.865 --> 03:35:45.038
MATT: You-- no, it's if you're within a range

03:35:45.038 --> 03:35:47.640
at the start of your turn, so you teleport in, you're fine.

03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:52.248
TRAVIS: Nice. And I will see and swing away on this thing

03:35:52.248 --> 03:35:55.813
with two strikes from the Star Razor.

03:35:55.813 --> 03:35:57.321
MATT: Go for it.

03:35:59.091 --> 03:36:00.787
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage because it's being flanked

03:36:00.787 --> 03:36:01.620
by a bunch of--
MATT: You have advantage

03:36:01.620 --> 03:36:03.200
because of Yasha's yell.

03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:04.766
TRAVIS: Amazing.

03:36:06.181 --> 03:36:07.521
That's a 25 to hit.

03:36:07.521 --> 03:36:08.354
MATT: That definitely hits.

03:36:08.354 --> 03:36:10.337
TRAVIS: And the second one is...

03:36:12.620 --> 03:36:13.956
21 to hit.

03:36:13.956 --> 03:36:17.552
MATT: That also hits. Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.

03:36:17.552 --> 03:36:20.374
MARISHA: ♪ She cried more, more, more. ♪

03:36:20.374 --> 03:36:22.090
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that's 20.

03:36:22.090 --> 03:36:26.190
MATT: (snarling)

03:36:27.427 --> 03:36:29.355
SAM: Gross, Matt. Gross.
MATT: Thank you.

03:36:29.355 --> 03:36:30.922
Sorry, dinner's kind of--

03:36:30.922 --> 03:36:33.938
TRAVIS: 35, 45.

03:36:33.938 --> 03:36:36.597
45 points of slashing damage.

03:36:36.597 --> 03:36:37.826
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:36:37.826 --> 03:36:40.263
(cheering and clapping)
MARISHA: There it is!

03:36:40.263 --> 03:36:42.791
TRAVIS: I'll reach over and see
Yasha all fucked up on one hand,

03:36:42.791 --> 03:36:44.979
and I'll just cut it off at the wrist

03:36:44.979 --> 03:36:46.323
and then I'll flip the blade back

03:36:46.323 --> 03:36:47.428
so it's pointing towards my elbow

03:36:47.428 --> 03:36:48.682
and I'll stick it in its navel

03:36:48.682 --> 03:36:50.844
and then just ride it up the middle.

03:36:50.844 --> 03:36:51.956
MATT: (snarls)

03:36:51.956 --> 03:36:55.744
It just spreads its innards outward,

03:36:55.744 --> 03:36:57.279
Beau, you would be in the splash zone,

03:36:57.279 --> 03:36:59.277
but you're a crazy monk and just sidestep it

03:36:59.277 --> 03:37:03.168
(splashing) as it goes across the dirt, rock in bits

03:37:03.168 --> 03:37:05.487
before it (slurps) slumps onto the ground,

03:37:06.329 --> 03:37:07.881
sliding into the rocks,

03:37:07.881 --> 03:37:09.576
pushing them aside as its body comes to rest

03:37:09.576 --> 03:37:10.876
at the bottom of the platform.

03:37:10.876 --> 03:37:11.709
TRAVIS: Nice.

03:37:13.084 --> 03:37:15.525
I will use the rest of my movement

03:37:15.525 --> 03:37:20.077
to run around this way.

03:37:20.077 --> 03:37:21.913
SAM: Just run around in circles?

03:37:21.913 --> 03:37:23.802
TRAVIS: Yeah, just in case puppy dog comes back.

03:37:23.802 --> 03:37:27.164
MATT: We'll say 25 there, since there
was one block of rough terrain there.

03:37:27.164 --> 03:37:28.727
So that's about as far as you can get at the moment.

03:37:28.727 --> 03:37:31.542
You're rushing around, blade in hand. (panting)

03:37:31.542 --> 03:37:32.452
TRAVIS: That's a full turn.

03:37:32.452 --> 03:37:34.349
MATT: Indeed. Now--

03:37:34.349 --> 03:37:35.546
SAM: Are we going to go rejuvenate

03:37:35.546 --> 03:37:37.101
or are we going to get the fuck out of here?

03:37:37.101 --> 03:37:38.516
TALIESIN: Rejuvenate's out. We should go right now.

03:37:38.516 --> 03:37:40.219
I can't hold this very long.

03:37:40.219 --> 03:37:41.451
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

03:37:41.451 --> 03:37:43.274
ASHLEY: Wait, do you want to check that rug real quick?

03:37:43.274 --> 03:37:44.360
TALIESIN: I'm going.

03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:45.882
SAM: Caleb, check it!

03:37:45.882 --> 03:37:48.390
LAURA: It's not a magic rug.

03:37:48.390 --> 03:37:51.486
TRAVIS: It's on the map for a
reason! It's there for a reason!

03:37:51.486 --> 03:37:52.319
(laughter)

03:37:52.319 --> 03:37:53.152
LIAM: Up!

03:37:54.311 --> 03:37:55.769
LAURA: Jeez.
MATT: Yep.

03:37:55.769 --> 03:37:58.214
TRAVIS: We stand on it and do that.
MATT: It's just chilling there.

03:37:59.631 --> 03:38:02.067
TALIESIN: I-- we're going to have another creature unless--

03:38:02.067 --> 03:38:03.401
TRAVIS: Let's go, let's go.

03:38:03.401 --> 03:38:04.930
MARISHA: Let's go!

03:38:04.930 --> 03:38:06.370
SAM: Grab the rug.

03:38:06.370 --> 03:38:08.088
MARISHA: Grab the rug and go.

03:38:08.088 --> 03:38:09.649
TRAVIS: Essek, grab that bitch!

03:38:09.649 --> 03:38:10.800
Who is that all the way in the back?

03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:12.362
LAURA: That's Caleb.

03:38:12.362 --> 03:38:13.661
TRAVIS: Drag that rug.

03:38:13.661 --> 03:38:15.730
ASHLEY: Just throw it off the side and we'll see.

03:38:16.997 --> 03:38:19.958
MATT: All right, so. With that Banishment held, you all

03:38:19.958 --> 03:38:21.659
gather and begin to rush back into the hall

03:38:21.659 --> 03:38:23.045
where you first arrived?

03:38:23.045 --> 03:38:25.853
TALIESIN: Is there a way to shut this door or no?

03:38:25.853 --> 03:38:27.975
MATT: There does not appear to be any sort of door there;

03:38:27.975 --> 03:38:29.560
it's just an open hallway.

03:38:29.560 --> 03:38:31.201
LAURA: We just go.
ASHLEY: Just jump.

03:38:31.201 --> 03:38:32.268
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:38:32.268 --> 03:38:33.101
TRAVIS: Don't you have Feather--

03:38:33.101 --> 03:38:35.716
SAM: Is there a drop? Have we seen how far the drop is?

03:38:35.716 --> 03:38:37.088
MATT: To the next floor, you have not.

03:38:37.088 --> 03:38:38.305
LAURA: Six floors down.

03:38:38.305 --> 03:38:39.138
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: From where we--

03:38:39.138 --> 03:38:40.396
TRAVIS: We got to go to nine.
MARISHA: How many--

03:38:40.396 --> 03:38:42.227
How many can we Feather Fall

03:38:42.227 --> 03:38:43.413
and how many can we--
SAM: All of us.

03:38:43.413 --> 03:38:44.625
MARISHA: -- take with--
LAURA: Yeah, then let's--

03:38:44.625 --> 03:38:45.516
TRAVIS: Do it!
LAURA: Feather Fall

03:38:45.516 --> 03:38:46.557
close to the edge and just go.

03:38:46.557 --> 03:38:47.390
LIAM: You can do all that?

03:38:47.390 --> 03:38:48.589
TRAVIS: Everybody at the edge.
SAM: I can do half.

03:38:48.589 --> 03:38:49.963
LIAM: I don't have it prepared.

03:38:49.963 --> 03:38:51.630
SAM: (nervous laughter)

03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:55.061
Well, I can do five, I think.

03:38:55.061 --> 03:38:56.052
TRAVIS: I can fly.

03:38:56.052 --> 03:38:57.259
LIAM: I can fly.
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:38:57.259 --> 03:38:58.209
TALIESIN: One, two, three--

03:38:58.209 --> 03:38:59.298
TRAVIS: Your spell slots are more important

03:38:59.298 --> 03:39:00.199
than my spell slots.

03:39:00.199 --> 03:39:01.537
LAURA: And he can float, so we're good.

03:39:01.537 --> 03:39:02.707
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five. We're good.

03:39:02.707 --> 03:39:04.662
LAURA: That's right. Let's go.
TALIESIN: Go.

03:39:04.662 --> 03:39:06.453
SAM: I'm including myself. (screams)

03:39:06.453 --> 03:39:08.369
LAURA: Don't fly out far. It's straight down!

03:39:08.369 --> 03:39:09.642
MARISHA: Wait, what?!

03:39:09.642 --> 03:39:13.459
(laughter)

03:39:13.459 --> 03:39:14.976
LIAM: (yelling)

03:39:14.976 --> 03:39:16.046
LAURA: -- three, four, five.

03:39:16.046 --> 03:39:17.046
Yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good.

03:39:17.046 --> 03:39:18.698
MARISHA: I think we're good.

03:39:18.698 --> 03:39:19.614
SAM: Sprinkle!

03:39:19.614 --> 03:39:23.359
(laughter)

03:39:23.359 --> 03:39:25.962
MATT: As you all go leaping off the edge,

03:39:25.962 --> 03:39:27.445
going into the faith maneuver

03:39:27.445 --> 03:39:29.888
of jumping into the darkness, you look down,

03:39:29.888 --> 03:39:31.682
elements of the water splashing to the right of you.

03:39:31.682 --> 03:39:35.620
You can now see, in that odd moment of intensity,

03:39:35.620 --> 03:39:38.618
time seems to slow as you take in the immensity

03:39:38.618 --> 03:39:40.051
of the vacuous space around you

03:39:40.051 --> 03:39:42.441
and the darkness that you're plummeting towards.

03:39:42.441 --> 03:39:44.162
As your Feather Fall kicks in,

03:39:44.162 --> 03:39:47.156
the two of you begin to take off on your flight

03:39:47.156 --> 03:39:50.490
and watch as Essek begins to float down as well,

03:39:50.490 --> 03:39:52.673
keeping pace with those who are Feather Falling.

03:39:52.673 --> 03:39:54.659
You just begin to drift downward

03:39:54.659 --> 03:39:58.055
and you pass another floor and another floor.

03:39:58.055 --> 03:39:59.808
Now, mind you, as part of Feather Fall,

03:39:59.808 --> 03:40:01.946
you still fall at the angle that you're going.

03:40:01.946 --> 03:40:03.308
LAURA: Yeah. That's why I said don't leap.

03:40:03.308 --> 03:40:06.775
I just stepped off so that I would go down.

03:40:06.775 --> 03:40:08.127
MATT: Okay.

03:40:08.127 --> 03:40:12.031
The path just continues and there is a platform

03:40:12.031 --> 03:40:12.864
beneath you at--

03:40:12.864 --> 03:40:14.343
LAURA: Fjord, Fjord, grab my hands.

03:40:14.343 --> 03:40:15.976
MATT: -- floor six.

03:40:17.570 --> 03:40:19.094
You guys just go straight to nine?

03:40:19.094 --> 03:40:24.094
LIAM: I zip past Essek and just showboat just a little bit.

03:40:24.446 --> 03:40:26.322
LAURA: I think the flyers can probably pull people out.

03:40:26.322 --> 03:40:29.343
So they're falling all the way to nine.

03:40:29.343 --> 03:40:31.639
TRAVIS: I'll Australian Shepard, like--

03:40:31.639 --> 03:40:34.305
MATT: Essek casts Fly himself and
begins to showboat as well.

03:40:34.305 --> 03:40:36.240
LIAM: Oh!
SAM: Showboating.

03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:37.073
ASHLEY: Whoa.

03:40:38.464 --> 03:40:40.667
TRAVIS: I go over to Veth, and I'm like (whooshing).

03:40:40.667 --> 03:40:43.317
SAM: (screams)
(laughter)

03:40:44.436 --> 03:40:49.436
MATT: Like the electrons of an atom,

03:40:50.184 --> 03:40:51.864
you just have Caduc-- Sorry.

03:40:51.864 --> 03:40:53.892
Caleb, Fjord, and Essek,

03:40:53.892 --> 03:40:55.684
just (whooshing)

03:40:55.684 --> 03:40:59.421
flying around the slowly falling, uncontrolled mass

03:40:59.421 --> 03:41:00.838
of the rest of the Mighty Nein.

03:41:00.838 --> 03:41:02.946
LIAM: A little water ballet. Don't mind us.

03:41:02.946 --> 03:41:05.479
MATT: Descending down deeper and deeper

03:41:05.479 --> 03:41:09.443
into the darkness of the remains

03:41:09.443 --> 03:41:11.219
of the Genesis Ward.

03:41:11.219 --> 03:41:12.768
That's where we're going to end tonight's episode.

03:41:12.768 --> 03:41:14.900
MARISHA: What, we haven't even hit ground?

03:41:14.900 --> 03:41:15.899
MATT: Nope.
TRAVIS: Nah. We flyin'.

03:41:15.899 --> 03:41:17.124
(screaming)

03:41:17.124 --> 03:41:18.948
MATT: We're going to deal with
that at the beginning of next session.

03:41:18.948 --> 03:41:20.989
MARISHA: Ah, cool.
TALIESIN: Banishment worked!

03:41:20.989 --> 03:41:22.695
I'm so glad I loaded that shit.

03:41:22.695 --> 03:41:24.345
TRAVIS: Yes.
MARISHA: It did?

03:41:24.345 --> 03:41:25.660
TRAVIS: Lucky he didn't dispel that.

03:41:25.660 --> 03:41:27.090
LAURA: Well, it didn't dispel

03:41:27.090 --> 03:41:29.022
because it was a different type of creature.

03:41:29.022 --> 03:41:30.819
I think that the ones with the hand could--
TRAVIS: Oh, you did it to the doggy.

03:41:30.819 --> 03:41:32.102
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:41:32.102 --> 03:41:33.280
TRAVIS: To the doggy.

03:41:33.280 --> 03:41:35.052
MATT: Yeah. From its position where it was standing

03:41:35.052 --> 03:41:36.822
and the rubble blocking the path there,

03:41:36.822 --> 03:41:39.558
I was looking. I was like, It's dubious that--

03:41:39.558 --> 03:41:40.982
It's uncertain that it would even notice

03:41:40.982 --> 03:41:42.050
that you were casting something

03:41:42.050 --> 03:41:45.399
and it currently was focused on everything around you.

03:41:45.399 --> 03:41:46.596
So it did not count.

03:41:46.596 --> 03:41:50.061
TALIESIN: It also would've meant that
I had to drop Bane to do it, too.

03:41:50.061 --> 03:41:51.668
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Bless, I mean.

03:41:51.668 --> 03:41:53.366
LIAM: Can you tell us why Fjord was so lucky?

03:41:53.366 --> 03:41:54.759
TRAVIS: I was-- wow.

03:41:54.759 --> 03:41:55.592
TALIESIN: Off-camera?
LAURA: Oh yeah!

03:41:55.592 --> 03:41:56.775
TALIESIN: Can you tell us off-camera?

03:41:56.775 --> 03:41:58.483
MATT: Well, we'll just say that the creature

03:41:58.483 --> 03:42:00.537
that got Banished has an ability that

03:42:00.537 --> 03:42:04.648
if peop-- creatures within 60 feet of it can't teleport.

03:42:04.648 --> 03:42:06.560
LAURA: (gasps) And he was just out of 60 feet?

03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:09.822
MATT: And it just van-- no, it just vanished the Banishment.

03:42:09.822 --> 03:42:12.497
Like, it was a perfect chain of events

03:42:12.497 --> 03:42:14.678
to fuck that up, and I was like, "Ah!"

03:42:14.678 --> 03:42:16.544
LIAM: So was a it a teleport dampener, kind of?

03:42:16.544 --> 03:42:18.052
TALIESIN: I'd like to think that creature--
MATT: Dimensional Lock.

03:42:18.052 --> 03:42:19.959
TALIESIN: -- wherever it went, freaked the fuck out.

03:42:19.959 --> 03:42:22.374
I want it to be like, where the fuck is these people?

03:42:22.374 --> 03:42:23.299
Where the hell am I?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:23.299 --> 03:42:24.782
TALIESIN: Oh, everything's gross.

03:42:24.782 --> 03:42:25.689
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:25.689 --> 03:42:26.764
MATT: Anyway,

03:42:26.764 --> 03:42:29.988
we'll pick up there next time.

03:42:29.988 --> 03:42:32.505
TRAVIS: Oh! So cool.

03:42:32.505 --> 03:42:34.006
MARISHA: Man, this is getting juicy.

03:42:34.006 --> 03:42:35.501
MATT: I know.
ASHLEY: This is getting real juicy.

03:42:35.501 --> 03:42:37.105
MATT: Thank you all for joining us.

03:42:37.105 --> 03:42:39.208
We'll see you next week, but we love you very much

03:42:39.208 --> 03:42:40.981
and is it Thursday yet?

03:42:40.981 --> 03:42:41.856
Good night.

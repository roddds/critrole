MATT: Hello everyone, and
welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:04.290
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.462
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.462 --> 00:00:08.689
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
LIAM: (high-pitched noises)

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.190
MATT: Ooh! Got into the upper echelon of notes there.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.130
Before we jump into tonight's session,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.700
we do have some quick announcements to get through,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.960
beginning with our sponsor for the evening, Deck of Many.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.040
Sam.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.860
SAM: Our sponsor's are Deck of Many tonight,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.690
so tonight we've put together a deck of many characters.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.650
These cards are all the ingredients you need

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.370
to get a classic Sam Riegel advertisement.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.930
It's stuff like, "offensive accent,"

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
or "parody song that we can't have the rights to,"

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.246
or "dad joke,"

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:41.970
or "offensive,"

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.803
or

00:00:42.803 --> 00:00:43.903
"offensive."

00:00:43.903 --> 00:00:47.690
So I'm going to pick three things randomly in this deck,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.750
and we're going to make a character for tonight.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.019
Okay, number one!

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.530
Santa Claus.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.880
Number two, France.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.420
Number three, Doctor.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.070
All right, let's go to the props.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.968
Let's see what we got here.

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:01.660
TRAVIS: Oh good, they've labeled them.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.140
SAM: Okay, got a doctor thing,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.990
LAURA: Oh, how convenient!

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.793
SAM: Got a-- Oh god, yeah, got that.

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:09.640
A French thing.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.270
Let's see what's a French one.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.895
TRAVIS: The mustache?
SAM: Oh shit.

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:14.940
Wait, these aren't peeled, are they?

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.703
Let's just go with it, we'll go with it.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:21.840
Okay, so I now present Dr. Pierre Santa Claus.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.940
ASHLEY: Nope, that's not how you put on a shirt.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.185
SAM: Ho, ho, ho-jour!

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:30.270
It is I, Pierre Santa Claus!

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.890
Deck of Many just launched their <i>Vendredi Noir</i>,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.500
that's Black Friday,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.150
sales this year early.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.224
Goddamn it!

00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:40.540
(laughter)

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.580
TRAVIS: Get the mustache on there,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.310
get the mustache on there, hold for mustache!

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.780
SAM: If you use the code, "CR <i>vingt-vingt</i>",

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.339
that's "CR2020," or the link,

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:49.297
"dickofmany"

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:53.750

Of course, I, being Santa Claus,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.150
can deliver all over the world!

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.070
On Dasher! On Dancer! On Depardieu!

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.890
On Disneyland Paris!

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.780
Ooh la la!
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.110
SAM: You can grab the classics from them,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.820
like animated spell cards, or the awesome RPG, Humblewood.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.400
Oh, I forgot, I'm also a doctor!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.239
TRAVIS: With a joint?

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.540
SAM: Get me 20ccs of the brand new, Islands of Sina Una,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.357
and a hypodermic injection of

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:28.230
The Griffon's Saddlebags books.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.687
(sighs)
(laughter)

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.400
I'm French, too!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.180
I do not shower!

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.760

<i>Vive la revolution! Vive la medicine! Vive la</i> Christmas!

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.278
Back to you, Matt.

00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:57.236
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yay.
LIAM: Wow.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.016
MATT: Wow!

00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:02.130
(laughs)

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.766
That was...

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.574
I haven't watched a person melt down in a while.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.158
SAM: I didn't have a lot of time to write the bit this week.

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:11.817
(laughter)

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:14.300
TRAVIS: We got a shout-out for Gerard Depardieu in there.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.260
MATT: We did, we did.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.410
MATT: I am all for creating a Sam Deck of Many,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.210
and then we just have to force you to do this.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.540
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.585
MATT: But we get to cultivate the cards.

00:03:24.585 --> 00:03:26.060
TRAVIS: That is a fat cigarette,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.721
is that supposed to be a cigarette?

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:30.956
SAM: It is a... I believe Marisha calls it a "blunt."

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:33.039
TRAVIS: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.376
MATT: I do appreciate that it has its own mustache.

00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:38.857
Thank you, Sam.

00:03:38.857 --> 00:03:41.187
Thank you, Deck of Many. (whispered) I'm so sorry.

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:43.250
(laughter)

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.630
For our next, announcements are short today,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.032
Laura, you have something to talk about.

00:03:47.032 --> 00:03:50.656
LAURA: Oh, well, hello there!

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:52.528
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:03:52.528 --> 00:03:54.107
ASHLEY: What is this?

00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:55.839
LAURA: Hold on, hold on.

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.430
(exclamations)

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.580
I had to put it on, I just love it so much.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.420
So yeah, we decided to make our Jester hoodie

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.300
from the Mighty Vibes video.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.976
MARISHA: Yes!

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:08.965
SAM: Oh, it's from that?!

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:09.981
LAURA: Yeah!

00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:13.460
SAM: Oh, that makes way more sense!
LAURA: So you can wear it, you can, you know,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.703
just, like, doodle, or whatever.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.550
This was, of course, inspired by the hoodie

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.278
that was designed by Kami Areopagita.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.880
She's the wonderful artist

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.962
that does the Mighty Vibes stuff.

00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:28.960
MARISHA: Opening title sequence.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.723
LAURA: Yes, she's phenomenal.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.950
And so, the hoodie is available in both

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.400
adult and kid sizes.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.470
Pushed for that one.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.919
So yeah, they're available in the US, the UK,

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.750
and the Australian stores.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.250
Check 'em out!

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.566
MARISHA: They're so cute.

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:48.841
LAURA: It's so wonderful.
TRAVIS: Ronin just loves to try to

00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:50.100
pull that horn off of your head.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.950
MARISHA: Is it squishy? Is the horn squish?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.942
LAURA: It squish!

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:54.382
SAM: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Lethal. It's lethal.

00:04:54.382 --> 00:04:57.090
LAURA: It's not lethal, it's so wonderful.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.593
Yeah, I've had Ronin running around in his.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.849
SAM: Look so cute!
ASHLEY: So cute!

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.917
little ears.
TRAVIS: Pretty dumb cute.

00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:06.840
MATT: I love it.
LAURA: So yeah, that's what I got.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.400
MATT: Thank you, Laura.
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.690
MATT: All righty, well that's all we've got

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.020
as far as announcements go today.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.853
TRAVIS: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.780
MATT: So let's go ahead and bring us into tonight's episode

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.059
of Critical Role.

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:21.826

well done!
LAURA: Why am I always late?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.113
MATT: Welcome back.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:11.113
So the Mighty Nein have made their way to Eiselcross.

00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:13.245
After agreeing to be hired by

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:16.460
Lady Vess DeRogna of the Cerberus Assembly,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.084
you made your way across the Frozen Depths

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:21.759
on an icebreaker ship known as the Midnight Hammer,

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.267
did some battle,

00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:25.148
made your way to Balenpost,

00:07:25.148 --> 00:07:28.781
the Cerberus Assembly-handled outpost here for the Empire

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.700
on the south end of Foren,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.600
the largest landmass within the region of Eiselcross.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.290
There, you made some friends, gathered some supplies,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.840
and prepared yourself to journey northward with Vess

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.520
and your hired guide, Dagen Underthorn, the following day.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.600
During the evening, you scryed upon Mollymauk

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.900
and discovered that he was taking some sort of a tome,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.410
a weirdly front-back-less bound tome,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.460
from a comfortable room, and seemed to peer back at you,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.090
could see you, and converse towards you

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.773
in the middle of your scry.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.620
After this chilling exchange,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.960
you all bore down for the night, and the next day,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.110
begin to wonder why Vess hadn't come to meet you.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.000
When you went to inspect her area

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.690
on the third and upper floor of the fort of Balenpost,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.890
you discovered her room had an open window,

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.701
a thick layer of snow,

00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:29.650
and her body laid strewn upon across the bed,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.140
blood pouring from her head and various orifices.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.820
You inspected, gathered her body, set it within your amber,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.700
and wore it to keep it under wraps.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.010
Using illusion, you convinced the individuals,

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.890
who were curious about why there was some commotion

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.650
at Balenpost, that Vess DeRogna was still alive,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.590
and that they do not have to worry about anything.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.600
In these moments, you quickly gathered your things,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.660
met up with Dagen, and set out northward from Balenpost,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.772
with none the wiser, for the time being,

00:09:03.772 --> 00:09:04.790
of what has transpired.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.530
So, Mighty Nein, carrying your magically-sealed corpse

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.040
of Lady Vess DeRogna, member of the Cerberus Assembly,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.420
and your fantastic guide, Dagen Underthorn,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.010
you leave into the frozen expanse,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.843
the distant white, snowy horizon of Eiselcross, northward.

00:09:18.843 --> 00:09:23.801
the distant white, snowy horizon of Eiselcross, northward.

00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:30.422
As the cold, midday afternoon beings to set upon you,

00:09:30.422 --> 00:09:33.400
the temperature causing your cheeks,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.580
or most of you who aren't Jester,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.140
to begin to sting with adjusting to the new,

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.450
much more frigid out atmosphere.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.050
You crunch through the snow, foot after foot,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.950
heading northward.

00:09:49.303 --> 00:09:51.897
After you get a little ways away from Balenpost,

00:09:51.897 --> 00:09:56.211
and you think you have at least some comfort

00:09:56.211 --> 00:10:00.850
out of earshot, aside from your companion, your guide.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.890
If there's anything you'd like to do, discuss or anything,

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.340
or we will move into the journeying portion of this trek.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.510
SAM: Matt, I think your music stopped, by the way.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.510
MATT: Oh, it did, it crashed, like apps do.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.343
TRAVIS: Like they do.

00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:17.053
And just out of curiosity, so the snow is about how high?

00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:20.370
Mid-shin? Knee?

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.420
MATT: From where you are right now,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.503
it can range anywhere from

00:10:25.503 --> 00:10:27.769
about knee to waist.

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:32.100
TRAVIS: So are we going to be slowed in this thick powder?

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.100
MATT: You would, except you have, and brought with you,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.070
somebody who is extremely well-versed in these regions.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.020
SAM: Is it me?!

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.412
MATT: No.
SAM: Okay.

00:10:44.412 --> 00:10:45.760
MATT: Not at all you.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.110
LAURA: Yeah, should we have bought, like,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.998
snow shoes or something?

00:10:48.998 --> 00:10:51.510
I didn't even think about that.
SAM: I just want shaved ice when I see you, Sam.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.957
It makes me so hungry.

00:10:52.957 --> 00:10:56.540
(laughter)

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.950
SAM: I got three different flavors.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.665
ASHLEY: Bubblegum and grape.

00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:01.510
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.410
MATT: So as you begin to set out, you watch as Dagen,

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.693
who has affixed these

00:11:07.693 --> 00:11:10.442
metallic, shovel-like elements

00:11:10.442 --> 00:11:13.252
to the front of his chair, lowers them,

00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:15.979
and you watch as they press down and become like

00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:20.150
a sled/carving mechanism at the front.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.207
And he just looks back over and says,

00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:25.168
"Well, if you're going to follow, stay close."

00:11:25.168 --> 00:11:26.100
He begins to push forward.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.710
You can see the wheels he has it set to

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.540
are different than the ones that he had when he was in town.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.740
These have these, like, jagged, metal grips

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.400
across them so they can pick up upon the dirt and the rock.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.200
And he just pushes along, and as he does,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.446
it just grinds this path through the snow, he says,

00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:43.226
"We've got a few miles of this and we might hit some ice,

00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:46.650
"at least hopefully part of the land that's not quite

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.597
"as challenging for you folk."

00:11:49.597 --> 00:11:51.190
TRAVIS: Dagen, is there anything that we can help

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.230
keep an eye out for on our flanks?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.642
Anything that likes to ambush or---

00:11:55.642 --> 00:11:57.242
MATT: "Anything."

00:11:57.242 --> 00:11:59.442
TRAVIS: Anything. Any--

00:11:59.442 --> 00:12:02.233
Anything is what we're keeping an eye out for.

00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:03.458
ASHLEY: Copy you.

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:06.074
LIAM: There's nothing good to see out here, then, at all?

00:12:06.074 --> 00:12:09.987
No cute, winter furry animals or the like?

00:12:09.987 --> 00:12:11.827
MATT: "Oh, there are animals, yeah."

00:12:13.772 --> 00:12:14.730
TRAVIS: Like jackrabbits or---

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.470
LAURA: We talked about the all of the monsters---

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.770
TRAVIS: Baby seals, or---

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.450
LAURA: The last game.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.040
MATT: "I mean, you won't find seals as far into

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.780
"the landmass itself.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.750
"You can go back to the shore if you're looking for seals.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.160
"But you might see some snow rabbits,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.600
"you might see some wolves,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.350
"you might see some other north-area bison of some kind,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.718
"but the further north we go,

00:12:36.718 --> 00:12:38.860
"the less game you're going to find."

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.041
TRAVIS: And this map from Lady DeRogna, here.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.930
I know we're traveling from Balenpost up towards Aeor.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.550
Are we going to go along this shoreline,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.610
around this sort of plateau-elevated area?

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.447
Or are we going to go along this--

00:12:55.447 --> 00:12:58.120
MATT: "I'd recommend going on the eastern side.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.073
"The cliffs are a little precarious."

00:13:00.073 --> 00:13:01.370
TRAVIS: Lava area.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.197
LAURA: Right, the lava river.

00:13:03.197 --> 00:13:07.790
MATT: "We'll stay far enough away, no reason 'til necessary.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.620
"Anyway, follow suit."

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.450
Now he does have
Natural Explorer (Arctic) feature,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.808
which means difficult terrain doesn't slow his group down.

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:19.632
LAURA: Yes!
SAM: Oh, his group!

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.968
MATT: None of you can become lost unless by magic means.

00:13:23.968 --> 00:13:25.180
TRAVIS: Except for Veth.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.246
LIAM: He a Ranger?

00:13:27.465 --> 00:13:28.698
LAURA: I bet he's a Ranger.
LIAM: He's a Ranger.

00:13:28.698 --> 00:13:30.448
MATT: He's taken a little bit of Ranger, yeah,

00:13:30.448 --> 00:13:32.031
That's why he's a good guide in these spaces.

00:13:32.031 --> 00:13:32.864
LIAM: Yeah.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.900
MATT: So following his lead forward.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.213
SAM: Where's your damn music?

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.521
MATT: It's not coming through to us.

00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:44.990
ALL: (vocalizes)

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.733
MATT: There you go, we have our own set, perfect.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.418
LAURA: Yay!

00:13:50.418 --> 00:13:51.951
LIAM: Spooky.
TALIESIN: Ah, that's better.

00:13:53.003 --> 00:13:54.500
TRAVIS: Spoopy.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.250
MATT: Pushing onward, heading northward,

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.910
you keep yourselves bundled,

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.220
trying desperately not to inhale too deeply

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.850
with any given breath,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.300
as certain elements of the wind as it cuts through

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.180
can cause the temperatures to drop,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.180
far lower than you're expecting.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.230
And you catch yourself one point or another sputtering,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.190
as you can feel some of the moisture in your lungs

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.730
seem to crystallize and freeze,

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.230
having to cough them back out.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:23.660
This is going to be a tough trek, but nevertheless,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.220
as Dagen is leading ahead,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.360
who is helming the main visual range around you?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.140
Who is keeping watch for anything?

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.270
TALIESIN: I'll do that.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.791
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.

00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:38.300
MARISHA: Can I use assist Caduceus?

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.839
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to.

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:43.505
MARISHA: I hover in his--

00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:45.288
I'm drifting behind him,

00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:48.138
you know, just trying to look wherever he's--

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.450
TALIESIN: You rolling with me or am I taking it?

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.550
MARISHA: You take it with advantage.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.520
TALIESIN: All right.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.570
TRAVIS: Staying in the wind tunnel.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:53.950
MARISHA: Yes, yeah.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.111
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:14:55.111 --> 00:14:57.639
(cheering)

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:59.400
TRAVIS: Start it off right!

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.400
MATT: These last two sessions you guys
have just been 20-ing it.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.233
That's good.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:05.880
Keeping that in mind,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.723
advantage wasn't needed on that one.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.850
Dagen does shout over his shoulder

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.007
as he's pushing forward.

00:15:15.007 --> 00:15:18.660
"You said we were going to the

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.590
"excavation to the east of Allowak's, right?"

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.507
LAURA: Um, A5 is where--

00:15:27.507 --> 00:15:28.340
MATT: "Right."

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.800
LAURA: -- Lady DeRogna told us to meet her.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.840
MATT: "I know roughly whereabouts where it is.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.220
"I've passed through there and taken some folks

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.130
"to and from before, so just follow me."

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.200
LAURA: Okay.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.927
MATT: So trekking through, there are--

00:15:40.927 --> 00:15:43.220
LAURA: Plus, you know, I could maybe send her a message

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.990
and see if those plans have changed.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.338
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, perhaps--

00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:50.521
MARISHA: Maybe after a few hours in,

00:15:50.521 --> 00:15:52.408
we should do that, though.
LIAM: Yeah, we're just getting started.

00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:54.282
MARISHA: Smart idea. Yeah.

00:15:54.282 --> 00:15:56.031
LIAM: Get some distance.

00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:57.519
LAURA: Yeah.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.430
MATT: "Fair enough."

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.030
TRAVIS: Just a note, on this map,

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.060
there is an "A?"

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.080
that's way to the east, not in the direction we're going.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.363
We're okay ignoring that for now, right?

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.200
SAM: Feels like we should do the ones that, like,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.164
people have gone to before.

00:16:15.164 --> 00:16:17.120
TRAVIS: Yeah, but the video gamer in me wants to go to

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.551
the question mark.

00:16:18.551 --> 00:16:19.680
LAURA: I mean, I definitely want to see

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.748
what the question mark is, but you know--

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:24.924
I-I know--

00:16:26.149 --> 00:16:27.723
Lady Vess had said--
TRAVIS: It's a long detour.

00:16:27.723 --> 00:16:32.325
LAURA: -- you know, "2A and A, to alpha, and alpha,

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.577
this is where it'll end."

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:37.540
SAM: Dagen, if we hit every one of the A's,

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.680
how long would that--

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.820
LIAM: Share the map.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.928
SAM: -- take?
MATT: "Just on the map,

00:16:40.928 --> 00:16:42.761
"or all the ones that are known?"

00:16:42.761 --> 00:16:45.797
SAM: Wait, there's ones known not on the map?

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.790
MATT: "Well, yeah, there's excavation's
all around Eiselcross,

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.443
"across multiple islands and

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:52.940
"these are just the ones in the southern portion

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.527
"of Foren, here."

00:16:54.527 --> 00:16:55.468
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Wow.

00:16:55.468 --> 00:16:58.117
TALIESIN: I think we stick to the map for now.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:01.830
MATT: "I was only paid to go to the main excavation

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.390
"and some destinations in between, as you pointed out,

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.220
"but if you're wanting to go further than that,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.010
"it's going to cost you more,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.660
"and if you want to go across different islands, well,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.640
"you're going to have to book us passage, as well."

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.707
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

00:17:14.707 --> 00:17:16.890
MARISHA: What's the furthest north you've been?

00:17:18.524 --> 00:17:20.513
MATT: "(sighs) To the crater."

00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:21.818
SAM: What's the crater?

00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:26.110
MATT: "There's this odd kind of bowl crater.

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.136
"I've only been there once.

00:17:29.136 --> 00:17:32.530
"There some of the wild folks tell myths

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.170
"of a place that, sometimes,

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.930
"it's not what you remember it was.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.140
"Some people say it's a dreamscape of beautiful greenery

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.540
"in the middle of the icy expanse.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.240
"Others say it's a volcanic destitute nightmare.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.870
"Others say it's weird, desert landscape

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.990
"where flying beasts scream.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.060
"And none of that makes sense and sounds like folks just

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.530
"going a little bit crazy when they're lost

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.110
"out in the wilds of Eiselcross,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.420
"but I saw it with my eyes, looked over a mountain ridge

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.253
"and there it was.

00:18:02.253 --> 00:18:06.010
"A big old valley filled with all sorts of weird lush green.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:06.885
"Didn't belong."

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.875
TALIESIN: I think I speak for the group when I say

00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:11.375
I feel like we've seen weirder, so that seems--

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:12.482
MATT: "All right, well, there you go.

00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:13.670
"Doesn't affect y'all that much."

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.697
TRAVIS: And you said this was further north?

00:18:15.697 --> 00:18:17.080
MATT: "It's to the very, very north."

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.030
TRAVIS: Very north.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.390
MATT: So right now you're tempting us with something

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.587
that has nothing to do with our current mission.

00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:25.730
MATT: "I can tell ya--"
SAM: That's amazing.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.433
MATT: "-- there's a lot of amazing things in Exandria,

00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:32.000
"and I hope you get to see some of them before you die,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.430
"but I ain't taking you everywhere."

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.805
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.
TRAVIS: That's fair, that's fair.

00:18:34.805 --> 00:18:36.313
LAURA: What if all the way north,

00:18:36.313 --> 00:18:39.087
maybe that's "homeward bound," you know?

00:18:39.087 --> 00:18:39.970
SAM: Oh.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.480
LAURA: Maybe that's where we're trekking, eventually.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.900
MARISHA: If it's a giant crater, I
wonder if that's where the--

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.372
LAURA: The city used to be.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:18:47.372 --> 00:18:49.782
TRAVIS: Dagen, you don't happen to have a map,

00:18:49.782 --> 00:18:52.128
or know of any of these excavation sites that might be able

00:18:52.128 --> 00:18:56.277
to provide a map, north of Aeor's location, do you?

00:18:56.277 --> 00:18:58.557
MATT: "I keep all that up here."
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:18:58.557 --> 00:19:00.371
Are you very good at drawing?

00:19:01.317 --> 00:19:02.280
MATT: "Haven't tried."

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.140
TRAVIS: Okay, we'll check it later tonight.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.990
MATT: "I can sign my name in the
snow if that's what you mean, but..."

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.431
LAURA: (laughs)

00:19:09.855 --> 00:19:10.688
TRAVIS: We'll talk later.

00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:12.285
MATT: "All right, fair enough."

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.590
And he keeps pushing on.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.110
Well, for the first day of travel,

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.330
and to get to that specific location on foot,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.513
thankfully still keeping Dagen in your current group,

00:19:24.513 --> 00:19:28.260
thankfully still keeping Dagen in your current group,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.042
you'll get there in about five or so days.

00:19:30.042 --> 00:19:31.858
SAM: Damn.
MATT: That's five days of travel.

00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:33.424
MARISHA: Sucks.
LAURA: Okay.

00:19:33.424 --> 00:19:35.815
MATT: So for the first day, I would
like someone to roll a d20 for me.

00:19:35.815 --> 00:19:36.890
LIAM: I'll do it!

00:19:39.994 --> 00:19:41.302
<i>Zwolf.</i> 12.

00:19:41.302 --> 00:19:43.160
MATT: 12!

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.610
LAURA: Oh no.

00:19:45.908 --> 00:19:47.116
SAM: You would've said that for any number.

00:19:47.116 --> 00:19:47.949
LAURA: Yep!

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.600
TRAVIS: The extremes seem to be bad.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.433
LIAM: Ooh no.

00:19:52.433 --> 00:19:55.610
MATT: You move along a fairly quiet day.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.630
The weather is clear.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.757
The soft snow that was falling near Balenpost

00:19:58.757 --> 00:20:02.320
and the southern portion of the island begins to dissipate.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.830
The wind begins to fall to just a fair breeze.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:09.830
While it is cold, your journey goes unimpeded.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.770
So the first day's journey, relatively uneventful.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.753
TRAVIS: Not bad.
LAURA and SAM: Nice!

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.123
MATT: Is there anything you'd like
to do before the day is done?

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.380
SAM: Any scrying, any messaging?

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.700
TRAVIS: I will actually see if I can borrow a piece of paper

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.100
from Caleb, maybe just a scrap,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.096
and see if he has any good cartography skills.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.233
LIAM: Here's five or six complete pieces of paper,

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.155
get whatever you need.

00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:37.177
LAURA: Oh, well, I mean, is that expensive paper?

00:20:37.177 --> 00:20:38.960
You can use my sketchbook.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.860
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, yes, yes!

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.170
Please, keep your expensive paper.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.570
The sketchbook's far easier.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.000
I mean, he might totally screw this up.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.833
Thank you.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.003
Could you just--
TALIESIN: If we wanted to

00:20:49.003 --> 00:20:50.769
ask her any more questions--

00:20:52.494 --> 00:20:57.000
well, we can't do that now, but in nine days or so,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.090
10 days.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.383
LIAM: That's how long a wait it is?
TALIESIN: It's a long time.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.623
It takes a toll.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.463
LIAM: I definitely can come up with questions for her.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.190
TALIESIN: It'll be a while.

00:21:13.248 --> 00:21:17.920
TRAVIS: Dagen, I wanted to see how your map-drawing skills

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.753
actually were.

00:21:18.753 --> 00:21:21.640
Do you want to take a gander at giving a rough,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.978
just a rough sketch of what north of Aeor might look like

00:21:24.978 --> 00:21:27.397
to the best of your ability?

00:21:27.397 --> 00:21:30.988
MATT: (grunts) "Yeah, I figure weather's not too bad.

00:21:30.988 --> 00:21:32.913
"Pass it on over."

00:21:32.913 --> 00:21:34.730
Takes it, puts it over his lap

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.500
and begins to take this piece of rough charcoal,

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.883
and sketch out.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.903
(die roll)

00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:49.003
(laughter)

00:21:49.003 --> 00:21:50.191
TALIESIN: Well, that's no fun.

00:21:50.191 --> 00:21:51.608
MATT: That was a two.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.737
He hands it back to you and goes,

00:21:54.737 --> 00:21:57.277
"I mean, that's as about as good as I can recall."

00:21:59.696 --> 00:22:01.379
I mean, it's...

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:04.587
It's a Rorschach test with less ink.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.117
There's a point where he was like,

00:22:08.117 --> 00:22:10.575
"Ah, there's Balenpost, and that's where we're going,

00:22:10.575 --> 00:22:14.395
"is Aeor, and up there's where that crater was,

00:22:14.395 --> 00:22:15.670
"place I was telling you about.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.550
"It's about another, I don't know--"

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.713
TRAVIS: Is this an organ?

00:22:21.227 --> 00:22:24.840
MATT: "What? No. Did I drool on it? Hold on."

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.260
He wipes his little patch of spittle from it

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.000
where he got excited and like (spits).

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.823
TRAVIS: That improved it somehow.

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:35.810
Thank you, this is wonderful.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.690
I feel like you have an Etsy shop waiting in the wings.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.947
Okay, I put that in my pocket.

00:22:41.947 --> 00:22:43.522
MATT: "I appreciate the joking facetiousness.

00:22:43.522 --> 00:22:44.960
"I just am not an artist."

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.127
TRAVIS: Nope, neither am I.

00:22:47.127 --> 00:22:48.252
MATT: "Not one for cartography,

00:22:48.252 --> 00:22:51.257
"but I know where I'm going. All right."

00:22:51.257 --> 00:22:53.793
And he keeps pushing on for the rest of the day.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.420
LIAM: Actually, at a certain point when Dagen is ahead of us

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.570
leading the way, I'll wait 'til he's preoccupied.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.010
Something that occurs to me that I want you all to put

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.790
in the back of your head, is that our friend here

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.250
probably is in some amount of contact

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.173
with the other members of the Assembly, but not anymore.

00:23:21.107 --> 00:23:21.940
LAURA: (whispering) Oh no.

00:23:23.972 --> 00:23:28.900
LIAM: Ikithon, at least, has some idea who she is with,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.058
at the moment, so.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.170
SAM: We may be hunted?

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.030
LAURA: At least we have the benefit of knowing that

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.468
probably no one's going to teleport here for us.

00:23:38.468 --> 00:23:40.140
LIAM: Probably.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.250
MARISHA: They knew she was coming here.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.470
They knew she was going to be off the grid, so to speak,

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.040
for a little bit.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.295
TALIESIN: Possible communication can't reach this place--

00:23:48.295 --> 00:23:49.452
MARISHA: Exactly.
TALIESIN: -- very well.

00:23:49.452 --> 00:23:50.285
LIAM: Possibly.

00:23:50.285 --> 00:23:53.210
MARISHA: Plus, maybe we can use

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.976
to our advantage the fact that

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:58.880
Cerberus Assembly members don't really seem to give a fuck

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.993
about one another.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:06.960
LIAM: I don't know if I would go that far.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.223
I think they probably all loathe each other. Some of them.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.470
But I don't think they would take kindly, all of them,

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.380
to having their colleagues wiped out.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.952
LAURA: One by one.

00:24:20.952 --> 00:24:23.801
LIAM: Anyway, keep your head on a swivel.

00:24:25.068 --> 00:24:26.185
TALIESIN: Always.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.503
LIAM: That's all.
MARISHA: What is the plan?

00:24:30.503 --> 00:24:33.240
What is the plan? Because we came up with

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.963
a temporary plan that buys us a little bit of time.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.203
LIAM: Yeah.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.290
LAURA: I don't know.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.545
MARISHA: Yeah, me neither.
SAM: What do you mean?

00:24:41.545 --> 00:24:45.550
We're going to go search for stuff, find Mollymauk,

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.491
bring him back to his senses,

00:24:48.641 --> 00:24:49.974
get that book,

00:24:49.974 --> 00:24:51.450
go back to the Cerberus Assembly,

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.064
and use it to take down the whole thing.

00:24:54.064 --> 00:24:57.420
TRAVIS: But Lady DeRogna, what do we--?

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.120
LIAM: Well, in the short-term, we could probably play stupid

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.223
at our first stop.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.090
She's not here, we haven't heard from her.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.470
You could try to communicate with her,

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.480
and maybe not be able to reach her,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.840
or make up a response.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.810
TRAVIS: She's in your amber, right?

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.090
LIAM: Yes.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.790
TRAVIS: If someone tried to scry, like we did on Molly,

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.513
would they just see your necklace?

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.310
LIAM: Well--

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.140
SAM: She's dead, you can't scry on a dead thing.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.714
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Yes, you can.

00:25:29.714 --> 00:25:30.814
SAM: You can?

00:25:30.814 --> 00:25:32.180
MARISHA: We scryed on Molly.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.013
SAM: Oh, shit.

00:25:33.013 --> 00:25:34.920
TRAVIS: Should I maybe give you your--

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.950
LIAM: Molly wasn't dead.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:36.783
TRAVIS: -- pendant back?

00:25:36.783 --> 00:25:39.090
LAURA: I scryed on Molly's grave site.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.620
MATT: You can scry on a location
and you can scry on a creature.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.010
LAURA: Yeah, so you can't scry on a dead person.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.530
But if they tried to scry, it wouldn't work.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.180
But I thought all of them were protected

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.373
against scrying anyway?

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.213
SAM: That's fair.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.460
TRAVIS: Yeah, but she's dead,

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.593
and she didn't have anything on her, no items.

00:25:57.593 --> 00:25:59.180
LAURA: No, but they were taken.
LIAM: Picked clean.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.680
TALIESIN: So if somebody starts looking

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.500
for something that was on her that they knew was there,

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.333
they wouldn't--

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:04.683
LAURA: They wouldn't find us; they would find--
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:26:04.683 --> 00:26:07.063
MARISHA: They would find Molly &amp; Co.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.270
TALIESIN: Molly &amp; Co.
TRAVIS: Right.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.920
As long as no one can track the item inside your necklace,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.533
again, like for the crystal clove.

00:26:16.496 --> 00:26:18.037
Cloven crystal.
LIAM: That was a whole other thing entirely,

00:26:18.037 --> 00:26:18.940
I believe.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.987
MARISHA: I kind of like the crystal clove.

00:26:20.987 --> 00:26:22.403
SAM: We'll be fine, we'll be fine.

00:26:22.403 --> 00:26:23.953
MARISHA: (inhales) Ah, it's nice.
TRAVIS: Beat poetry.

00:26:25.728 --> 00:26:27.636
MARISHA: (giggles)

00:26:27.636 --> 00:26:28.469
TRAVIS: Daddy-o.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.930
LIAM: How's it going, Dagen?

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.600
MATT: As you guys are like, cresting up the nearby hill,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.460
you can see the light in the skies beginning to dim,

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.580
begin to get the sense that a colder night

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.217
is to arrive soon, and he goes,

00:26:44.217 --> 00:26:45.290
"I'm keeping an eye out.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.070
"I think I found a patch where we can go ahead

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.020
"and set up camp out here.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.040
"I'll show you all how to live nice and comfortable here

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.545
"in the snow overnight.

00:26:52.545 --> 00:26:55.900
"There's a trick to staying alive in this freezing cold.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.900
"Come, let me show you,"

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.817
and he lowers the metallic piece down, and you watch

00:26:59.817 --> 00:27:02.299
as he leans forward, and sleds out of view

00:27:02.299 --> 00:27:03.936
on the other side of the hill.
TRAVIS: Whoa!

00:27:03.936 --> 00:27:05.914
LAURA: Oh, man. That's--

00:27:05.914 --> 00:27:07.770
TRAVIS: Should we try to keep up?

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.700
SAM: Yep. Let's sled.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.700
Who's got something?

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.660
LAURA: Oh, I got a shield.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.480
TALIESIN: Last time I did this, it did not work out well,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.517
I'm going to sit on my shield.
LAURA: I'm going to put my shield

00:27:16.517 --> 00:27:17.630
on the ground and sled down.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, go.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.690
MATT: Both Jester and Caduceus rush up at the top,

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.339
and then jump on their shields, and

00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:23.610
(sliding)

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.410
much faster than you were expecting.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.493
TALIESIN: Always true.

00:27:27.493 --> 00:27:30.830
MATT: You watch as Dagen comes to the bottom of the hill,

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.560
and he's guiding himself left and right,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.130
leaving this zig-zag trail.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.380
He's done this a lot, and has very, very intense control

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.213
over it.

00:27:38.213 --> 00:27:40.800
Before skidding to a stop at the base of the hill,

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.270
and as he turns around, noticing you guys coming behind him,

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.160
both sides, he goes, "Shit!"

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.150
and quickly wheels backward.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.540
I need both of you guys to make dexterity saving throws

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.373
for me, please.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.540
TRAVIS: You're going to clock our guide.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.470
TALIESIN: Natural one.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.170
LAURA: Oh no!

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.710
Ooh, 19!

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.543
MATT: 19.

00:28:02.543 --> 00:28:06.280
So you manage to maintain control,

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.630
you go spinning and spinning and spinning,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.820
but you come to a rest without issue.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.910
As Dagen lunges backward out of the way,

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.330
you skid into the bank where he had ground his wheels

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.560
into the ground trying to get out of the way,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.360
and as it does, it hits the shield,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.592
goes head-first into this little dirt patch.

00:28:23.592 --> 00:28:25.822
(crashing) And you go flying.

00:28:25.822 --> 00:28:26.870
(whooshing)

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.700
You guys all get to the top of the hill and glance over

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.920
as you watch this impact, and Caduceus gets thrown about

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.319
25, 30 feet through the air, before

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:35.152
(crashing)

00:28:35.152 --> 00:28:39.350
like, his limbs all splayed out on an ice sheet,

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.703
as he just spins.

00:28:41.962 --> 00:28:44.120
LAURA: Caduceus!
MATT: Slowly coming to a stop,

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.900
face down, in the snowy,

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.600
icy ground.
LAURA: I get up and run after Caduceus.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.416
LIAM: That's something, seeing a seven-foot tall dude

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:50.249
go windmilling.

00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:51.219
(laughter)
MATT: Yep.

00:28:51.219 --> 00:28:52.810
You take three points of bludgeoning damage.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:53.670
TALIESIN: Ah, that's fair.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.077
TRAVIS: But what about his pride?

00:28:55.077 --> 00:28:57.130
MATT: Oh, that's far more damaged.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:57.963
TALIESIN: That's gone.

00:28:57.963 --> 00:28:59.270
ASHLEY: You okay?

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.353
TALIESIN: No!

00:29:00.353 --> 00:29:02.436
(laughter)

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.190
LAURA: I run over and grab his sun hat

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.233
and put it back on his head.

00:29:07.233 --> 00:29:09.598
TALIESIN: Am I on an ice sheet or something? Or am I--

00:29:09.598 --> 00:29:10.760
LAURA: Do you have a sun hat on?

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.793
You don't have a sun hat on.
TALIESIN: No.

00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:13.476
LAURA: What do you have on?
LIAM: A winter hat.

00:29:13.476 --> 00:29:15.900
TALIESIN: I don't have-- I have a hat,
but I wasn't wearing it.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.733
LAURA: You don't have a hat?

00:29:16.733 --> 00:29:18.080
TALIESIN: I do, I have a little thing, but I don't wear it

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.985
all the time.

00:29:18.985 --> 00:29:20.051
LAURA: It's very cold up here,

00:29:20.051 --> 00:29:21.809
you should probably put it on, Caduceus.

00:29:21.809 --> 00:29:23.500
TALIESIN: A little flag cap.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.100
LIAM: I'm going to fish out a bit of catmint

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.560
and bring up Cat's Ire and just have the giant cat's claw

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.360
sit upside down in the snow.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.193
Join me?

00:29:31.193 --> 00:29:32.026
SAM: Yes!

00:29:32.026 --> 00:29:34.300
LIAM: We sit down together and I basically just control

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.270
the upside down claw down to the snow like a sled.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.533
MATT: Okay, you both glide down.
MARISHA: Bye.

00:29:40.533 --> 00:29:42.387
MATT: To answer your question, Caduceus,

00:29:42.387 --> 00:29:44.520
and there are some regions of this,

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.650
especially in small valleys between hills,

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.910
or areas where the land tends to swoop down a bit.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.480
A lot of the snow eventually just congeals

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.313
into ice towards the bottom.

00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:54.510
TALIESIN: So it's a slick?

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.135
MATT: Yeah, it isn't like an open lake or anything,

00:29:56.135 --> 00:29:57.900
but you just managed to land in a slick patch

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.028
of solidified ice and just skid out from there.

00:30:00.028 --> 00:30:01.577
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl out of it.

00:30:01.577 --> 00:30:03.385
TRAVIS: I think it's the three of us.
TALIESIN: Grab my shield.

00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:06.474
TRAVIS: Have you ever tried to run downhill in snow before?

00:30:06.474 --> 00:30:07.307
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:08.490
ASHLEY: I want to try something.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.626
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:30:09.626 --> 00:30:12.080
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out my Skingorger and use it

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.096
like a snowboard.

00:30:13.096 --> 00:30:14.007
LAURA: (gasps)

00:30:14.007 --> 00:30:15.840
MARISHA: That's, like, the worst thing!

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.574
LIAM: A big rusty blade.
ASHLEY: I'm going to take it out.

00:30:17.574 --> 00:30:19.170
LIAM: What could go wrong?

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.003
ASHLEY: And then head down.

00:30:20.003 --> 00:30:23.700
MATT: All right, as you jump onto it, your first foot hits--

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.130
or your back foot leans against the back

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.263
as the blade (vibrating)

00:30:28.263 --> 00:30:31.440
spits up like you're stepping on the front of a rake.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.975
The blade comes up a bit.

00:30:32.975 --> 00:30:34.680
You put your other leg on the front,

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.207
and then just begin to lean, to let the weight hit

00:30:37.207 --> 00:30:39.938
as you hit the fulcrum point, and then

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:40.880
(swooshing)

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.010
Faster than you're expecting.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.600
Suddenly, you're being carried down at an extreme speed.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.967
Your hair (whooshing).

00:30:45.967 --> 00:30:50.270
You guys just watch Yasha become this blur of black

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.843
against a white snowscape beneath you.

00:30:52.843 --> 00:30:54.150
I need you to make a dexterity check, please.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.230
LAURA: On a very, very, very sharp weapon.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.910
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that's true.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.090
It's like a missile heading towards our friends.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.100
ASHLEY: Oh, I have advantage. I have advantage on dex.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.493
SAM: Hey, look, there's a sword coming towards us.

00:31:05.493 --> 00:31:07.889
LIAM: We'll just go to the side.
ASHLEY: 15.

00:31:07.889 --> 00:31:09.730
MATT: 15! 15.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.290
As you are gliding down, you see that one bit of dirt

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.550
that Caduceus' shield is still lodged in,

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.030
and you go, "Oh, shit!"

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.210
and you pull back a little bit against the back

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.950
of the blade, and as such, you actually catch the shield,

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.110
as opposed to just digging into the bank.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.422
What it does, though, is launch you--

00:31:26.422 --> 00:31:27.797
SAM: Yes!
MATT: -- a little bit,

00:31:27.797 --> 00:31:30.242
(whooshing) You get some air on Skingorger.

00:31:30.242 --> 00:31:32.648
ASHLEY: Yes, get some air!
SAM: Touch the board!

00:31:32.648 --> 00:31:35.290
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Toe grab?

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.690
ASHLEY: Yeah, toe grab!

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.665
Or heel grab, heel grab.
MATT: There you go.

00:31:39.665 --> 00:31:41.122
LIAM: Wicked games, brah.

00:31:41.122 --> 00:31:42.729
TRAVIS: (slicing sound) Ah!

00:31:42.729 --> 00:31:44.446
(laughter)

00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:48.415
MATT: And you, in a surprisingly
brilliant display of control,

00:31:48.415 --> 00:31:50.513
your first time bladeboarding--

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.025
LAURA: I just picture slow-motion, over my head. Whoa!

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.937
MATT: You eventually hit the same patch of ice

00:31:58.937 --> 00:32:02.410
a number of feet away from Caduceus, grinding into it,

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.360
before coming to a stop.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.820
You can see, as the back of the blade,

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.110
as you're holding it upward,

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.930
you're actually sending a bunch of ice shavings

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.550
into the air before eventually coming to a stop,

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.275
and there's this--
ASHLEY: I'll do one of those (scraping skid)

00:32:12.275 --> 00:32:15.790
and then get Caduceus all sprayed with ice.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.280
MATT: There you go.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.570
Whoosh! Caduceus, you are immediately coated

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.610
in a light layer of shorn ice.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:22.863
ASHLEY: Oh, hello!

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.110
LIAM: Yasha invented snowboarding! Canon.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.681
TALIESIN: Somebody's not getting shaved ice.

00:32:28.681 --> 00:32:30.923
I'm going to start collecting it.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.350
TRAVIS: We're just running down the hill.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.818
MARISHA: We're racing because we ain't got shit.

00:32:35.818 --> 00:32:37.940
LIAM: Oh, yeah, run down an icy hill.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:38.950
MATT: You don't have to roll for this.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.910
It's not an easy trek down.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.970
You're both eventually going in, like, waist-height snow,

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.801
like, having to grind through, but she's--

00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:46.967
TRAVIS: But it's competitive.

00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:49.170
MATT: It is. She's a monk, and she's much faster than you.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.210
TRAVIS: You don't know that.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.650
MATT: Yes, I do. It's on her character sheet.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.590
So you get about halfway down the hill before you look up

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.050
and notice that Beau's already at the bottom,

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.010
like Sonic the Hedgehog,

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.737
arms crossed, like, tapping her foot.

00:33:01.737 --> 00:33:03.747
ASHLEY: "Yes you do. It's on your character sheet."

00:33:03.747 --> 00:33:04.890
(laughter)

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.568
TRAVIS: I lost my shoe. I lost my shoe.

00:33:07.568 --> 00:33:08.867
MARISHA: Oh, how far back?

00:33:08.867 --> 00:33:11.323
TRAVIS: It took about-- you didn't
see how long I was sitting down?

00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:13.605
MARISHA: Oh, I think I see it at
the top of the hill. Oh no.

00:33:13.605 --> 00:33:14.931
TRAVIS: I'm wearing it now.

00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:17.014
(laughter)

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.760
TRAVIS: Good job, good one.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.120
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.660
If you want to resume your training at any point,

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.270
let me know.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:30.195
TRAVIS: Oh, I never stopped. It's
not like I've gotten any better.

00:33:31.427 --> 00:33:33.830
But yes, maybe we need to increase our reps.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.510
MARISHA: (laughing) Okay, yeah.

00:33:36.687 --> 00:33:38.590
MATT: "I think I found a place!"

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:42.460
You guys look over and this little bit of a valley area,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.080
some hills in the nearby space,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.660
you can see one of the hills comes to a brief cliff,

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.500
and there's a tiny alcove underneath it,

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.890
where icicles glide down,

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.780
these thick icicles, that some of them come five,

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.860
six feet long from the edge of the cliff to where they stop,

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.450
giving this weird, cage aesthetic to this maybe

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.963
12-foot tall little shaded alcove under this edge

00:34:02.963 --> 00:34:04.570
of the cliff face.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.720
There, you can see Dagen is putting one of his sacks

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.516
over onto the ground next to where he's situating,

00:34:10.516 --> 00:34:12.007
and he goes,

00:34:12.007 --> 00:34:14.160
"All right, this'll be a place to bed down for the night.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.430
"We'll go ahead and build a fire,

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:18.980
"and this'll be enough of an area to keep heat

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.650
"for at least a semi-comfortable night's rest,

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.380
"so we don't freeze in our sleep."

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.200
TRAVIS: Is the cliff face all ice, or stone and ice?

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.310
MATT: As you approach and look,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.706
it looks like there is stone and ice.

00:34:31.706 --> 00:34:32.900
There are elements of exposed stone,

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.460
but even they have some ice crystal on them.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.850
But you could probably melt back or carve back

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.750
a bit of the ice to eventually get to stone.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.728
TALIESIN: Do we--

00:34:39.728 --> 00:34:41.490
MARISHA: Are we camping here or are we glamping?

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:43.890
SAM: We'll probably wait 'til he goes to sleep,

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:45.550
and then we'll go into Caleb's--

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.260
MATT: Well, you've already used your mansion for the day.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.001
SAM: Oh, wait, what?
LIAM: Is this the same day?

00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:50.542
MATT: It's the same day.

00:34:50.542 --> 00:34:51.517
LIAM: Well, I was going to-- all right,

00:34:51.517 --> 00:34:52.507
I didn't think it was the same day,

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:53.660
but I was going to say,

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.260
I think we should learn something here,

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.190
because we could be without magic.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.170
We're going to be here a great while. Let's see--

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.420
MARISHA: That's true. What if you--

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.511
okay, if you summoned your mansion, though,

00:35:03.511 --> 00:35:05.933
is there a possibility that, like,

00:35:05.933 --> 00:35:08.730
you could summon it in the Abyss?

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.298
LAURA: Oh, right.
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:35:10.298 --> 00:35:12.210
LAURA: What if we went in and then we came to step out

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.899
and all of a sudden we were in another plane?

00:35:14.899 --> 00:35:17.040
SAM: Because magic is weird here?
MARISHA: Yeah. Because magic is weird here.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.701
SAM: Oh, we might want to do a night where we test it.

00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:23.800
LAURA: What if we went in and instead of cats, it was, like,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.173
turtles?

00:35:25.173 --> 00:35:27.390
Fjord, it would be a nightmare.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.450
SAM: You know what we could do, tomorrow night,

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:32.130
when you're able to cast it, you could cast it,

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.360
could send Frumpkin in, and then have him come back out,

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.353
and see, like, if he was--

00:35:37.353 --> 00:35:39.967
MARISHA: Is shredded?
SAM: -- mutated or something.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.520
LIAM: Yeah, he generally disapparates, you know,

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.831
in like a puff of fey cloud, but yeah, the idea is good.

00:35:47.831 --> 00:35:48.940
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: We can do that.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.320
But let's study everything that Dagen does

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.620
so that we, you know, if we are--

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.830
SAM: We're still doing the dome, though, right?

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:55.820
I mean, we're not crazy.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.890
LIAM: Not tonight. Not tonight.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.450
MARISHA: Full camping.
LIAM: Full camping.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.680
MARISHA: All right.
TALIESIN: Good call.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.846
LIAM: Study time.

00:36:01.846 --> 00:36:03.400
SAM: I don't like this.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.883
MARISHA: We've done this before.

00:36:04.883 --> 00:36:06.016
SAM: Yeah, I didn't like it then either.

00:36:06.016 --> 00:36:08.056
MARISHA: That's okay. That's fair, yeah.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.630
LIAM: But I will light my hand on fire and offer to help

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.520
start a fire for Dagen.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.129
Day-gen or <i>Dag</i>-en?
MATT: <i>Dag</i>-en.

00:36:15.129 --> 00:36:16.371
LIAM: Dagen.
SAM: Day-gone.

00:36:16.371 --> 00:36:17.749
LIAM: Day-gone, I assume.

00:36:17.749 --> 00:36:19.850
MATT: The pronunciation's been a little wild last episode,

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.198
but Dagen.
LIAM: Dagen.

00:36:22.198 --> 00:36:24.456
TALIESIN: Hard to pronounce without the eyebrows.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.970
MATT: So Dagen helps situate a space where you take some of

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.420
the snow that's in that area,

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.630
and create a slight exterior barrier.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:37.927
It's maybe about waist or so high.

00:36:37.927 --> 00:36:39.230
LAURA: Ooh, I'm going to help with that,

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.850
because I like to build with snow.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:41.683
MATT: Okay.

00:36:41.683 --> 00:36:43.792
Just a little ways out in case the wind does blow through,

00:36:43.792 --> 00:36:46.020
to help cut where it would come through,

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.200
in case it picks up throughout the night.

00:36:50.588 --> 00:36:55.300
With your help, you manage to dig a little pit in the ground

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.325
where it's just dirt, like wet, damp dirt,

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.610
and begin to set up what you normally would for a fire.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.746
You easily provide it, and he's like,

00:37:04.746 --> 00:37:08.535
"Ah, see, now that makes it a lot easier.
Appreciate the aid."

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.990
Once you get the fire going for a bit,

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.850
you can see it lights up and eventually water droplets

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.660
start falling from the icicles overhead

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.183
that are beginning to melt.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.890
But this is a semi-comfortable camping space,

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.940
in the sense that you will have to probably

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.050
get very close together, and even then,

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.040
you're half-exposed to the elements,

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.260
and by the time you finish setting the space up,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.950
it has gotten to the point where dusk is long past,

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.980
and there's just a faint, bluish-purple glow

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.980
to the clouds above, that then turns into absolute darkness,

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.640
beyond the faint bit of firelight

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.510
that's currently glowing the interior of this space.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.860
The temperature noticeably drops even further,

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.510
and you all instinctually begin to get closer

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.040
around the fire and to each other,

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.463
because it is fucking cold out there.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.284
But, as you all gather, Dagen reaches behind,

00:38:09.284 --> 00:38:10.990
and pull-- opens one of his...

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.165
And you look at this point now behind

00:38:12.165 --> 00:38:13.370
and you see that he has this cloak over,

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.760
this big, thick furred cloak that he throws over

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.750
the back of the chair, but he has all manner of bags.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.450
Like, this huge collection of saddlebags

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.060
that are affixed to the back of his chair,

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.660
and he pulls out this glass jug, this dark glass jug,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.060
and goes, "If the fire's not helping ya,

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.689
"I got other things to help."

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:35.647
ASHLEY: What is that?

00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:37.748
MATT: "It's good. Try it."

00:38:38.677 --> 00:38:39.735
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:38:41.749 --> 00:38:43.197
(gasps)

00:38:43.197 --> 00:38:44.740
MATT: Yeah, it is...

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.324
It's Everclear.

00:38:48.324 --> 00:38:51.500
It's just, like, pure grain alcohol,

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.710
but it's also weirdly grainy,

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.790
like you can feel something in your teeth

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.107
that grinds a bit.

00:38:59.107 --> 00:39:00.123
LAURA: Gross.

00:39:00.123 --> 00:39:03.700
MATT: Yeah, the texture is odd, but
it definitely does the job,

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.557
and as he sees your expression, he goes,

00:39:05.557 --> 00:39:07.170
"See, it's not meant to be enjoyable.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.824
It's meant to be functional."

00:39:08.824 --> 00:39:10.327
ASHLEY: Oh, I can tell.

00:39:10.327 --> 00:39:12.356
MATT: "Good, good. Anyone else?"

00:39:12.356 --> 00:39:13.815
LAURA: Warms you up?
ASHLEY: Very warm.

00:39:13.815 --> 00:39:14.881
MATT: "Yeah."

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.680
TALIESIN: I mean...

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.345
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: When in Eiselcross?

00:39:31.345 --> 00:39:32.970
TALIESIN: Exactly.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.138
TALIESIN: I take a good slug.

00:39:37.414 --> 00:39:39.265

SAM: Why don't you have some of mine?

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.990
I'll share my flask with Dagen.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.764
Try some of this stuff.

00:39:55.764 --> 00:39:57.375

"Not too bad."
SAM: Dainty stuff?

00:40:05.227 --> 00:40:06.617
MARISHA: Is that your rosé?

00:40:06.617 --> 00:40:08.360
SAM: No, that's not ready yet. We had to leave

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.556
before it was ready.
MARISHA: That's right.

00:40:09.556 --> 00:40:12.038
SAM: It was still whiskey.

00:40:12.038 --> 00:40:15.209
MARISHA: "Your whiskey is dainty stuff." That's pretty bold.

00:40:15.209 --> 00:40:17.286
LIAM: Yeah, I'll have that one, not the dainty.

00:40:17.286 --> 00:40:18.329
ASHLEY: It is warm.

00:40:18.329 --> 00:40:20.248
LAURA: Yeah, I feel it.
MATT: It does, it warms up

00:40:20.248 --> 00:40:21.169
the chest area.

00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:22.310
ASHLEY: Yes, I feel it.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.400
MARISHA: Yeah, I think I have heartburn issues from now on.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.437
Yeah, like, forever now.

MATT: "Yeah, well, welcome to Eiselcross!"

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.537
ASHLEY: I've never had a drink that's crunchy, you know?

00:40:33.537 --> 00:40:35.463
LAURA: It's, like, gritty, you know?

00:40:35.463 --> 00:40:37.980
Like a little bit of sand caught in your teeth.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.083

any group other than ourselves.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.717
the Kryn Dynasty folk?

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:09.023
TRAVIS: It's the same thing.

00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:12.720
MATT: "We're not going to keep it stoked,

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.930
"if that's what you're worried about.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:16.330
"But you're going to need the heat,

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.446
"I'd say a little more than

00:48:17.446 --> 00:48:19.510
"you're going to be worried about being seen.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.650
"That's why we're tucked in here.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:23.320
"For the most part, we'll be all right."

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.223
LIAM: I'm so sorry, this has been very entertaining,

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.010
sharing drink with you, and educational how you've built

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.070
this little lean-to, and the fire is great,

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.150
but this is a lot colder than I anticipated,

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:36.433
so I begin to start ritual casting the dome.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.303
And I will fill in--

00:48:39.303 --> 00:48:41.990
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, and I pull him to the side.

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:44.090
What happened to this being like a learning thing?

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:46.410
LIAM: Yeah, I learned, I saw what he did, I saw the setup.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:47.610
It's cold.
LAURA: Oh, here.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.490
And I pull out the Rod of Hand Warming.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:51.631
Are you so cold? You can use the Rod.
TRAVIS: This is like it's a book.

00:48:51.631 --> 00:48:54.423
LAURA: Just hug it to you. It keeps your chest warm.
TRAVIS: It's only the first few chapters.

00:48:54.423 --> 00:48:55.423
Got to finish the book.

00:48:55.423 --> 00:48:57.537
LIAM: There is no meat on my bones.

00:48:57.537 --> 00:48:59.790
LAURA: Here, use this. Hug it to your chest.

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:01.013
ASHLEY: Do you want my jacket?

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.990
LIAM: Okay.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.850
MARISHA: You can do this.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:06.683
LIAM: Okay.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.460
MATT: Much like the younger brother in A Christmas Story,

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.467
Caleb is now suffused in layers.

00:49:12.467 --> 00:49:14.754
LIAM: "Ooh, a zeppelin, that's mine!"

00:49:14.754 --> 00:49:17.560
(laughter)

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.030
MARISHA: Hey, this is going to suck, all right?

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.930
It's going to suck all night.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.954
TALIESIN: Anyone having a problem falling asleep,

00:49:22.954 --> 00:49:25.179
let me know, so I can help with that.

00:49:25.179 --> 00:49:28.110
TRAVIS: What, are you just going to choke us out, or what?

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:30.943
LIAM: Snap our necks?
ASHLEY: A little dream tea?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.180
TALIESIN: I can do about an hour of Protection from Energy

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.294
which will make the cold not hurt so much.
LAURA: Oh, same, same. Yeah.

00:49:37.294 --> 00:49:38.870
TALIESIN: So you can fall asleep properly.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:39.730
SAM: I'll take that.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:40.877
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:42.230
TALIESIN: I can only do one at a time.
MARISHA: Aww.

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:43.730
LAURA: I can do you, Beau.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:49:46.892 --> 00:49:50.080
SAM: Dagen, is there an unwritten code among you guys

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.953
that you're not allowed to fall for the people you guide?

00:49:52.953 --> 00:49:54.117
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ.

00:49:54.117 --> 00:49:55.500
SAM: Or, if you do,

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.976
that you're not allowed to
kiss on the mouth or anything like that?

00:49:58.976 --> 00:50:01.685
(chuckles)

00:50:01.685 --> 00:50:02.982
MATT: "Why ya asking?"

00:50:02.982 --> 00:50:06.300
SAM: I'm curious about you and your operation.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.080
LAURA: Oh my gosh, have you ever fallen in love

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.850
with anybody that you're guiding?

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.970
Have you ever had an affair

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:13.005
with anybody that you're guiding, like a secret love affair

00:50:13.005 --> 00:50:13.986
or anything?

00:50:13.986 --> 00:50:16.069
LIAM: With all just snuggling by the fire to keep warm.
MATT: "Why?"

00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:17.410
"No! Of course not!"

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.418
SAM: Aw!

00:50:18.418 --> 00:50:21.220
MATT: "Look around you, it's a fucking frozen hellscape!"

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.027
SAM: You might want to cuddle at night to keep warm!

00:50:24.027 --> 00:50:28.024
MATT: "I'll cuddle to keep warm, yeah,
but it's physical only."

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:29.340
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: Well, that's okay, too.

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.530
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Okay!

00:50:32.055 --> 00:50:33.644
MATT: "Look, you do what you do to survive.

00:50:33.644 --> 00:50:36.280
"If fringe benefits come with that, that's fine, too.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.605
"But emotion doesn't key into this."

00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:39.438
SAM: That's what I was saying,

00:50:39.438 --> 00:50:43.830
you guys have an unwritten code.
LAURA: It starts as just a physical thing,

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.670
but then slowly over the weeks that you're guiding them,

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.640
you just realize, "Oh, my gosh, I think I might have

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.990
"feelings for them, but I can't let them know, you know,

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.340
"because there's an unwritten code,"

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:58.170
and then it gets awkward, and then long glances, you know.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.467
SAM: But then at the end of
the trip, you settle up your wages,

00:51:01.467 --> 00:51:05.262
and put them on a ship back to wherever they came from.

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.593
LAURA: And it's so tragic.

00:51:06.593 --> 00:51:09.300
SAM: And they wipe a tear, and you wipe a tear,

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.760
and you don't know if you'll ever see each other again.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.540
LAURA: And then you have to pretend, you have to pretend

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:15.880
for the rest of your life that it didn't mean anything.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.260
SAM: Take that pocket of coins, and as you spend them,

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.600
it's just one more memory going away.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.800
LIAM: Hey, Dagen, are we the worst ones yet?

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.200
MATT: "Getting real close."

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.723
MARISHA: What was their name?

00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:31.770
MATT: He takes a big swig of the jug, puts it back, goes,

00:51:33.347 --> 00:51:34.750
"I'm going to get to sleep."

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:37.770
He goes ahead and unbuckles himself from the chair

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:40.653
and sets himself down in his little bundle of furs.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:44.510
MARISHA: I'm really invested in this story now.

00:51:45.604 --> 00:51:47.017
MATT: "There isn't a story!"

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:50.716
ASHLEY: He's hiding something.
MARISHA: He's got to be.

00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:52.340
MATT: "I'm not hiding anything, and I can hear you!

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.430
"We're real close!"

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.693
LAURA: You know who it was?

00:51:54.693 --> 00:51:55.567
MARISHA: (gasps) Who?

00:51:55.567 --> 00:51:56.700
LAURA: It was Sheila!

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.830
MARISHA: (exclaims of excitement)

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.031
MATT: He stays absolutely silent.

00:52:01.031 --> 00:52:03.700
(laughter)

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.460
SAM: We'll get to the bottom, we'll slowly break him down.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.600
Few more days.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.460
TRAVIS: I'll take the first watch,

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.290
and I will summon the Star Razor and I will cast

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:14.660
See Invisibility

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:18.910
to see if there are any wandering orbs,

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.300
or things that are following us

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.090
or keeping track of where we are.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.080
MATT: Okay.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.570
LIAM: I will have Frumpkin, I will not take the first watch,

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.560
but I will have Frumpkin keep Fjord company, and help look.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.610
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:33.583
MATT: All right.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.930
It's fucking cold, y'all.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.528
About two hours into your first watch,

00:52:41.528 --> 00:52:44.970
the temperature seems to keep dropping,

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.620
and it's hard to sleep.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.130
You are finding yourselves occasionally waking yourself up

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.140
with your body's muscles shaking

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.470
to maintain interior warmth.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:57.180
This is terrible, and this is the first night here.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:59.800
You've got going on two weeks of travel

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.870
before you get to the destination of

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:04.823
Aeor's central excavation.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:07.540
Make a perception check for me.

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:13.220
TRAVIS: 22.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.053
MATT: Okay.

00:53:16.656 --> 00:53:18.490
You keep watch for a bit, keep an eye out,

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.013
you go ahead and

00:53:21.766 --> 00:53:22.803
use your See Invisibility

00:53:22.803 --> 00:53:25.160
and look out into the darkness, and it's odd,

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:29.160
because, once again, you have the very faint embers of fire,

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.890
that everyone you watch slowly just

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:34.890
crawl closer to it as they need the heat, subconsciously,

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:39.310
until it's just this tangled fire pit of furs and people

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.790
trying to survive.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.670
And you're wedged in there, with your sword.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.250
It's got a faint glow off the runes as you look off

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:47.730
into the darkness.

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:49.460
And every now and then you see just faint bits of snow

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.973
that fall in and then melt before they hit the ground.

00:53:57.023 --> 00:53:57.856
(vibration)

00:53:57.856 --> 00:54:01.970
This faint, little arcane glow appears at

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:05.640
the periphery of your vision about 10 feet away

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.686
in the darkness.

00:54:08.972 --> 00:54:12.567
TRAVIS: I sort of look off, play it real cool.

00:54:18.316 --> 00:54:20.428
(whispers) Caleb.

00:54:20.428 --> 00:54:21.438
LIAM: (meows)

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.030
TRAVIS: Wake up.
LIAM: (meows)

00:54:26.336 --> 00:54:27.270
LIAM: What time is it?

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:30.110
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to wake you. Do you smell that?

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:31.750
LIAM: Do I smell it?

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.720
TRAVIS: Yeah, it just smells like rotting eyes.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:42.143
LIAM: I go blind and drop into Frumpkin,

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.830
and Frumpkin tipples up to the little snow wall

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:49.460
and starts to just wee a little bit.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.493
Do I see anything?

00:54:51.434 --> 00:54:52.267
MATT: No.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.193
LIAM: Okay.

00:54:55.193 --> 00:54:56.810
TRAVIS: Didn't really have a plan for what happened

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:57.695
if I noticed.

00:54:57.695 --> 00:55:00.595
SAM: (chuckles)

00:55:00.595 --> 00:55:01.953
LAURA: Do you have Dispel Magic?

00:55:01.953 --> 00:55:02.840
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.758
LIAM: So everything's quiet then, yeah?

00:55:09.547 --> 00:55:14.250
TRAVIS: Pretty good. I think we're
making good times towards the

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.840
most eastern

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.583
location that we're heading to.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:26.258
That one as far east on the map that we have.

00:55:26.258 --> 00:55:29.366
That one as far east on the map that we have.

00:55:29.366 --> 00:55:30.780
LIAM: Oh, well we could certainly go further.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.097
Do I see anything when I look in that direction?

00:55:33.097 --> 00:55:34.195
MATT: No.
LIAM: No.

00:55:35.328 --> 00:55:37.231
We could probably go farther.

00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:38.756
TRAVIS: Yep. Yep.

00:55:43.355 --> 00:55:44.730
Well, that's it.

00:55:46.044 --> 00:55:47.527
Don't really know what else to do.

00:55:47.527 --> 00:55:50.620
LIAM: I don't know that I can go to sleep now, Fjord.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.770
TRAVIS: Yes, yes.

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:55.310
I will actually...

00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.620
I'll walk out, slowly, casually,

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.274
in the direction of this sphere.

00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:05.302
MATT: Okay, it's only a couple feet off

00:56:05.302 --> 00:56:07.125
from where Jester's sleeping.

00:56:08.942 --> 00:56:11.342
TRAVIS: Hmm. I keep walking

00:56:12.462 --> 00:56:14.760
until I'm-- About what height is it in the air?

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.090
Like up in the air? Head height?

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:17.340
MATT: It's about head height.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.950
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll just do that thing where you're like,

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:22.900
just acting like you don't see it,

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.960
and I'll try to get as close to it as possible

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.610
and see if it moves.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.633
MATT: Okay. It doesn't move.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.683
It's been stationary the entire time since it appeared.

00:56:34.274 --> 00:56:35.577
TRAVIS: It's just a sphere, right?

00:56:35.577 --> 00:56:38.400
MATT: It's just this tiny, translucent,

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.040
gently pulsating arcane sphere,

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.350
that's made of immaterial energy,

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:49.150
and you can just barely see it,

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:51.430
and it's drifting about three feet out

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.740
from where Jester is sleeping,

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.560
and it's about five feet, a little over five feet,

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.393
off the ground.

00:56:55.393 --> 00:56:57.383
LAURA: Is it similar to the orbs that were in the house

00:56:57.383 --> 00:56:58.680
when he saw--

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:02.080
MATT: Yes, it's actually pretty dang close to the spheres

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.326
that you saw back in the Xhorhaus.

00:57:05.326 --> 00:57:10.172
TRAVIS: I'll lean in close to where it is,

00:57:10.172 --> 00:57:11.870
and I won't look at it, but I'll say--

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:14.300
LIAM: You're wearing the amulet, too, dude.

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.966
TRAVIS: What's that?
LIAM: You're wearing my amulet,

00:57:15.966 --> 00:57:18.303
which dispelled those things before.

00:57:18.303 --> 00:57:22.150
LAURA: That's true, he's wearing
the amulet that dispels scrying.

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:24.250
TRAVIS: I think it just hides me?

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.167
LAURA: You, if you get close to it.
LIAM: I know, but we had instances where it--

00:57:28.387 --> 00:57:30.430
TRAVIS: "You are hidden from divination magic.

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:32.770
"You cannot be targeted by such magic or perceived

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:34.010
"through magical scrying sensors."

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:35.710
Right, but it's not looking at me.

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.883
I'll lean close to it, and say:

00:57:42.297 --> 00:57:44.793
It seems like we're not the only ones watching.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.880
If you try to harm my friends, we will hunt you down

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.383
to the ends of the earth.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.433
Keep. Your. Distance.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:57.963
And I'll walk back.

00:57:57.963 --> 00:57:59.611
MATT: Okay. You're attuned to that necklace?

00:57:59.611 --> 00:58:01.244
TRAVIS: I am.
MATT: Okay.

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:02.910
TRAVIS: Yeah, I took off the...

00:58:04.885 --> 00:58:06.122
Ring of Fire Resistance.

00:58:06.122 --> 00:58:10.830
(laughter)

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.130
LIAM: Someday, someone will inherit that ring, though,

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:19.697
and it'll be really meaningful.

00:58:20.934 --> 00:58:22.914
TRAVIS: Look, we're a long way away from the lava, okay?

00:58:22.914 --> 00:58:23.836
There's still time.

00:58:23.836 --> 00:58:27.479
(laughter)

00:58:27.479 --> 00:58:28.312
MATT: Okay.

00:58:31.024 --> 00:58:32.797
You watch it as you sit back down,

00:58:35.664 --> 00:58:39.087
then eventually it just vanishes.

00:58:42.464 --> 00:58:44.884
TRAVIS: I'll go back over the Caleb and say:

00:58:44.884 --> 00:58:48.997
There was another scrying sphere eye.

00:58:50.343 --> 00:58:51.542
Someone is watching.

00:58:51.542 --> 00:58:55.737
LIAM: Oh, great, take your pick on who wants us dead.

00:58:57.034 --> 00:59:01.138
TRAVIS: The Empire, the Dynasty, Molly.

00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:01.971
LIAM: (scoffs)

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:06.465
My money is on the tiefling.

00:59:08.374 --> 00:59:10.189
TRAVIS: "Our scent," he said.

00:59:14.244 --> 00:59:17.052
LIAM: Scent. Our blood?

00:59:20.676 --> 00:59:21.934
TRAVIS: Our blood.
LIAM: Maybe.

00:59:24.464 --> 00:59:26.774
TRAVIS: Do you have any idea how to counteract that?

00:59:26.774 --> 00:59:28.634
Blood magic?

00:59:28.634 --> 00:59:30.477
LIAM: Well, if it's that, no, I do not.

00:59:32.711 --> 00:59:34.604
Gods, it's cold.

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:35.437
TRAVIS: It is.

00:59:38.534 --> 00:59:41.189
All right, I'll keep an eye out.

00:59:43.484 --> 00:59:46.424
MATT: Okay, the for the remainder of your watch

00:59:46.424 --> 00:59:48.224
nothing else catches your attention,

00:59:49.174 --> 00:59:50.674
second watch, who's taking it?

00:59:53.514 --> 00:59:56.514
Okay, both you guys roll perception.

00:59:59.309 --> 01:00:00.317
LAURA: Good.

01:00:01.621 --> 01:00:02.454
14.

01:00:02.454 --> 01:00:04.151
TALIESIN: 12.

01:00:04.151 --> 01:00:04.984
MATT: Okay.

01:00:07.194 --> 01:00:09.564
You guys catch the point in the evening

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:12.647
where the deepest cold hits.

01:00:14.004 --> 01:00:17.884
When your breath, even amongst the embers

01:00:17.884 --> 01:00:20.864
which have slowly diced to this faint source

01:00:20.864 --> 01:00:24.124
of orange, dull glow.

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:25.214
In this pitch black, though,

01:00:25.214 --> 01:00:28.284
it still is enough light that your eyes adjusted.

01:00:28.284 --> 01:00:30.484
You can make out the shape of your friends around it,

01:00:30.484 --> 01:00:32.114
and you can trick yourself into believing

01:00:32.114 --> 01:00:34.314
that the heat there is still useful.

01:00:34.314 --> 01:00:38.647
But your breath now becomes a perpetual fog in front of you.

01:00:40.354 --> 01:00:43.297
You can feel the edge of your nose go numb,

01:00:44.334 --> 01:00:47.454
and beyond this little alcove,

01:00:47.454 --> 01:00:49.244
the faint snow still falling,

01:00:49.244 --> 01:00:51.097
the wind picks up ever so slightly,

01:00:52.644 --> 01:00:55.330
but you don't notice anything else of danger.

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:57.674
Nothing else beyond just the weather

01:00:57.674 --> 01:00:59.074
and the terrible discomfort.

01:01:00.674 --> 01:01:04.694
LAURA: I crawl over and tuck under Caduceus' arm,

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.034
so we can shnuggle.

01:01:06.034 --> 01:01:07.830
TALIESIN: Got a cloak. We cloak.

01:01:09.104 --> 01:01:10.544
Brr.

01:01:10.544 --> 01:01:11.787
LAURA: This is awful.

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:17.414
TALIESIN: Someone once said pain is good for you.

01:01:17.414 --> 01:01:18.247
LAURA: Who said that?

01:01:18.247 --> 01:01:19.566
TALIESIN: I don't know. They're terrible people.

01:01:19.566 --> 01:01:21.766
LAURA: They're horrible.
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:01:21.766 --> 01:01:23.190
LAURA: We should make sure that

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:24.990
Caleb uses the dome from now on.

01:01:26.144 --> 01:01:27.814
TALIESIN: I respect the learning experience,

01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:29.594
and I feel like we've all learned a lot.

01:01:29.594 --> 01:01:31.400
LAURA: I feel more mature now.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.742
TALIESIN: You seem more mature.

01:01:32.742 --> 01:01:33.575
LAURA: Thank you.

01:01:35.034 --> 01:01:35.867
MATT: All right.

01:01:35.867 --> 01:01:38.404
We'll say for the purposes of the evening,

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:41.265
the rest of the morning light begins to come in.

01:01:41.265 --> 01:01:43.694
I would like everyone to make a constitution saving throw

01:01:43.694 --> 01:01:44.840
for me, please.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.807
TRAVIS: A saving throw?

01:01:45.807 --> 01:01:46.645
MATT: Yes.

01:01:48.781 --> 01:01:49.631
LAURA: Everyone?

01:01:49.631 --> 01:01:50.791
MATT: Everyone.

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:52.129
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:53.621
ASHLEY: Same!
TRAVIS: 25.

01:01:53.621 --> 01:01:55.808
MATT: Nice!

01:01:55.808 --> 01:01:56.641
TALIESIN: 16.

01:01:56.641 --> 01:01:57.513
MARISHA: 16.

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.385
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Nine.

01:01:59.385 --> 01:02:00.984
LIAM: 19.
LAURA: 18.

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:02.834
MATT: Damn, look at you guys rolling high.

01:02:02.834 --> 01:02:03.944
Except for you, Sam.

01:02:03.944 --> 01:02:05.074
You take a point of exhaustion.

01:02:05.074 --> 01:02:06.457
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:02:08.154 --> 01:02:09.377
SAM: Exhaustion one.

01:02:09.377 --> 01:02:10.727
LIAM: Love you, transmuter's stone.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.209
LAURA: Except he did, at the beginning of the night,

01:02:12.209 --> 01:02:13.684
have Protection from Energy.

01:02:13.684 --> 01:02:14.570
SAM: For one hour.

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:16.219
MATT: For one hour.

01:02:16.219 --> 01:02:18.264
TALIESIN: It won't undo the exhaustion

01:02:18.264 --> 01:02:20.496
if I'm casting it on her?

01:02:20.496 --> 01:02:21.329
MATT: Cast--?

01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:23.444
TALIESIN: Protection from Energy again?

01:02:23.444 --> 01:02:25.783
MATT: No, the exhaustion is there.

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:28.053
It's a whole night of very tenuous sleep

01:02:28.053 --> 01:02:30.807
in a very harsh environment that caused it.

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:35.403
But nevertheless, as you guys all come to consciousness,

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:38.344
you see that Dagen is already situated up in his chair,

01:02:38.344 --> 01:02:40.504
and has currently set the fire up a little bit,

01:02:40.504 --> 01:02:45.134
and is cooking up what smells like some decent meat.

01:02:45.134 --> 01:02:46.254
You look over and he has a little

01:02:46.254 --> 01:02:47.914
cast iron skillet out there

01:02:47.914 --> 01:02:49.494
and he's blowing on the flames

01:02:49.494 --> 01:02:50.514
as he's holding it over there,

01:02:50.514 --> 01:02:52.584
his thick, grizzled hand holding it

01:02:52.584 --> 01:02:54.744
and you can see the edges of it beginning to curl

01:02:54.744 --> 01:02:55.669
and burn.

01:02:57.334 --> 01:02:58.994
TRAVIS: I told Caleb this last night,

01:02:58.994 --> 01:03:00.954
but we had someone watching us.

01:03:00.954 --> 01:03:04.394
There was a scrying sphere in the air.

01:03:04.394 --> 01:03:06.234
MATT: "Well, that's some bullshit."

01:03:06.234 --> 01:03:07.214
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:03:07.214 --> 01:03:08.750
MATT: "Who'd be scrying on you?"

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:10.204
TRAVIS: Well, that's a great question.

01:03:10.204 --> 01:03:13.872
I'm not sure if it was an enemy or a friend.

01:03:13.872 --> 01:03:17.415
But Jester, it was located where you were.

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:20.300
Perhaps it's the Gentleman?

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.292
Or perhaps it's--

01:03:22.292 --> 01:03:24.114
LAURA: I don't think he can do it.

01:03:24.114 --> 01:03:26.307
SAM: Sounds like Lucien,

01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:30.471
because she scryed on him and he knows her now.

01:03:30.471 --> 01:03:32.968
LAURA: It could be anyone from the Assembly.

01:03:32.968 --> 01:03:35.292
TRAVIS: Does Lucien know her now, though,

01:03:35.292 --> 01:03:36.678
from the scrying spell?

01:03:36.678 --> 01:03:38.623
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Didn't he say to her,

01:03:38.623 --> 01:03:39.456
"Thank you for--"

01:03:39.456 --> 01:03:41.463
LAURA: Well, no, he wouldn't have seen me,

01:03:41.463 --> 01:03:43.844
he would've seen a little ball, you know?

01:03:43.844 --> 01:03:45.304
SAM: Yeah, but maybe he has some magic

01:03:45.304 --> 01:03:46.217
that can back trace it.

01:03:46.217 --> 01:03:50.219
I mean, he said, when you scryed on him last,

01:03:50.219 --> 01:03:51.728
"Thank you for leading me to you,"

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:52.928
or something like that.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:03:52.928 --> 01:03:55.224
He said he caught our scent.

01:03:55.224 --> 01:03:58.427
LIAM: He's also covered in eyes. It seems to be a motif.

01:03:59.634 --> 01:04:01.024
TALIESIN: Blood magic?

01:04:01.024 --> 01:04:02.407
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Probably.

01:04:03.725 --> 01:04:06.914
Well, if that happens again, just wake me up.

01:04:06.914 --> 01:04:08.462
I can dispel it.

01:04:08.462 --> 01:04:11.080
TALIESIN: I gave someone blood ages ago.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.751
SAM: Was that you?

01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:14.664
MARISHA: It was the Gentleman.

01:04:14.664 --> 01:04:16.022
TALIESIN: What happened to that blood?

01:04:16.022 --> 01:04:17.274
MARISHA: I think he still has it.

01:04:17.274 --> 01:04:19.651
LAURA: No, the Gentleman gave it to me. I have it!

01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:21.572
I have all of our blood, see?

01:04:22.452 --> 01:04:24.344
TALIESIN: Well, at least we know it's not that.

01:04:24.344 --> 01:04:29.334
TRAVIS: Wait, I thought-- didn't Cree--?

01:04:29.334 --> 01:04:32.454
SAM: Cree, yeah. She was the blood person.
TRAVIS: Cree. Didn't she draw blood out?

01:04:32.454 --> 01:04:35.634
LAURA: She drew our blood and gave the vials to my dad,

01:04:35.634 --> 01:04:37.454
and I took our vials from him.

01:04:37.454 --> 01:04:39.094
TRAVIS: What, she didn't keep any for herself?

01:04:39.094 --> 01:04:42.117
LAURA: She could have, but you know--

01:04:42.117 --> 01:04:44.834
MATT: Make an investigation check, Jester.

01:04:44.834 --> 01:04:45.734
SAM: All the vials are empty.

01:04:45.734 --> 01:04:47.023
You just never noticed it.

01:04:47.023 --> 01:04:49.295
TRAVIS: They're ketchup.
TALIESIN: It's cranberry juice!

01:04:49.295 --> 01:04:51.235
LIAM: While everyone's debating--
LAURA: Investigation?

01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:53.784
LIAM: -- Caleb holds his hand out and uses Control Flame,

01:04:53.784 --> 01:04:56.314
and I make the bonfire grow two feet

01:04:56.314 --> 01:04:57.722
and hotter.
TRAVIS: Awesome.

01:05:00.674 --> 01:05:02.998
MATT: Dagen goes, "Oh, shit!"

01:05:04.583 --> 01:05:05.894
He holds it up top.

01:05:05.894 --> 01:05:06.754
LAURA: 12.

01:05:06.754 --> 01:05:07.587
MATT: 12?

01:05:09.044 --> 01:05:11.254
I mean, it's hard to tell.

01:05:11.254 --> 01:05:13.914
The amount you have in the vials is not a lot,

01:05:13.914 --> 01:05:15.254
but you have a hard time really recalling

01:05:15.254 --> 01:05:16.507
how much was taken.

01:05:17.644 --> 01:05:19.619
Could be all of it, you don't know.

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:24.094
TRAVIS: I think they were almost full,

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:25.357
if I remember correctly.

01:05:27.894 --> 01:05:29.214
TALIESIN: Interesting.

01:05:29.214 --> 01:05:30.864
TRAVIS: Why, do you know anything about blood magic?

01:05:30.864 --> 01:05:32.791
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: Oh, good, yep.

01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:35.574
LAURA: Oh! Well, wait, no.

01:05:35.574 --> 01:05:36.407
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:05:37.914 --> 01:05:39.584
SAM: But if it was hovering near Jester

01:05:40.624 --> 01:05:42.967
that implies that it's someone who

01:05:42.967 --> 01:05:44.693
has recently been thinking about Jester.

01:05:44.693 --> 01:05:47.051
LAURA: When you do that,

01:05:47.051 --> 01:05:47.884
when you scry on someone,

01:05:47.884 --> 01:05:49.932
you can only see that person.

01:05:49.932 --> 01:05:53.301
You know, like you go in and you see them

01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:55.294
and you can see the things very close.

01:05:55.294 --> 01:05:56.564
Like, if I was reading a book,

01:05:56.564 --> 01:05:57.874
they would see that I was reading a book,

01:05:57.874 --> 01:05:59.024
but they would have to really focus

01:05:59.024 --> 01:06:01.611
to try to see what book I was reading, you know what I mean?

01:06:01.611 --> 01:06:05.844
So it has to be focused on me

01:06:05.844 --> 01:06:07.631
if the ball was near me.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:11.084
Unless I was lying close to anybody else,

01:06:11.084 --> 01:06:14.103
but I mean, still, if it was close to me.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.584
SAM: If this happens again,

01:06:15.584 --> 01:06:18.164
perhaps we should have some sort of code word

01:06:18.164 --> 01:06:20.944
where Fjord can say like--

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:22.334
TRAVIS: I'm terrible at my job.

01:06:22.334 --> 01:06:23.584
SAM: -- artichokes--
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:26.500
SAM: -- and you can then start spouting off

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.760
incorrect knowledge about our destination

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.934
or something like that.

01:06:29.934 --> 01:06:31.159
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:06:31.159 --> 01:06:32.314
LIAM: You also have to do a little test

01:06:32.314 --> 01:06:37.314
and see if anything happens in the mansion.

01:06:37.684 --> 01:06:40.778
I think that might be off limits, maybe?

01:06:40.778 --> 01:06:41.689
Maybe.

01:06:44.374 --> 01:06:46.304
Money is still on the tiefling, though,

01:06:46.304 --> 01:06:49.360
because if you were the focus,

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.484
it's possible anyone could've been looking at you,

01:06:51.484 --> 01:06:53.464
but who at the Assembly would focus on you?

01:06:53.464 --> 01:06:55.067
Who in the Dynasty would focus on you?

01:06:55.067 --> 01:06:57.044
SAM: Someone with very good taste in people.

01:06:57.044 --> 01:06:58.117
LAURA: Thank you very much.

01:06:58.117 --> 01:07:00.725
MARISHA: I mean, he looked back at you

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:02.741
last time that you scryed.
LAURA: Yeah, but

01:07:02.741 --> 01:07:03.998
all he could see was a ball,

01:07:03.998 --> 01:07:05.289
you know what I mean?

01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:07.183
Like, Fjord, you wouldn't--

01:07:07.183 --> 01:07:08.240
TALIESIN: You think.

01:07:10.384 --> 01:07:12.384
TRAVIS: I don't have nine eyes tattooed on me.

01:07:13.365 --> 01:07:14.674
LAURA: What would I look like

01:07:14.674 --> 01:07:16.204
if he could see me in a little ball?

01:07:16.204 --> 01:07:17.724
Do you think it would be like--

01:07:17.724 --> 01:07:19.641
MARISHA: Fisheye?
LAURA: Like a fisheye, yeah?

01:07:20.609 --> 01:07:22.664
Would he have seen my facial reactions

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:23.684
as he was talking to me?

01:07:23.684 --> 01:07:27.024
'Cause I didn't think anybody could see, you know.

01:07:27.024 --> 01:07:28.464
TRAVIS: You were sleeping with your mouth open,

01:07:28.464 --> 01:07:29.642
if it's any consolation.

01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:30.934
LAURA: Was I drooling?

01:07:30.934 --> 01:07:32.294
Oh, it's frozen.

01:07:32.294 --> 01:07:33.540
That's interesting.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:38.893
MATT: "Well, I don't know nothing about blood magic,

01:07:38.893 --> 01:07:40.014
"but whatever the fuck y'all

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.944
"are tied up in sounds real complicated.

01:07:41.944 --> 01:07:43.869
"But I got some bacon."

01:07:43.869 --> 01:07:44.874
MARISHA: Bacon!

01:07:44.874 --> 01:07:46.464
MATT: "It's not real bacon; it's wolf bacon,

01:07:46.464 --> 01:07:48.254
"but it's similar texture."

01:07:48.254 --> 01:07:49.464
TRAVIS: Wolf bacon.

01:07:50.679 --> 01:07:53.304
MATT: And it's actually a pretty solid slab here.

01:07:53.304 --> 01:07:54.824
He's like, "I figure this would be a nice way

01:07:54.824 --> 01:07:58.554
"to welcome you after your first night out on the plains.

01:07:58.554 --> 01:08:00.429
"Everyone sleep okay?"

01:08:00.429 --> 01:08:01.787
LIAM: (shivering)
MARISHA: We didn't.

01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:02.620
MATT: "(laughs)"

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.594
TALIESIN: Tomorrow night will be better.
LIAM: Like a frozen log.

01:08:04.594 --> 01:08:07.544
MATT: "It's not going to get better, so buck up."

01:08:07.544 --> 01:08:08.460
TRAVIS: We learned a lesson, yes?

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.814
Hard lesson learned. All the wiser for it?

01:08:10.814 --> 01:08:11.647
Seasoned travelers?

01:08:11.647 --> 01:08:14.011
LIAM: So much character built last night.
TRAVIS: So much.

01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:15.344
SAM: Barely slept.

01:08:15.344 --> 01:08:17.094
TRAVIS: Bushels of character.

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:18.864
MATT: "It's early, we should get moving."

01:08:18.864 --> 01:08:21.794
He goes ahead and pushes some dust over towards the flame,

01:08:21.794 --> 01:08:23.674
"If you don't mind lowering it a bit."

01:08:23.674 --> 01:08:24.914
LIAM: Do you want me to get rid of it,

01:08:24.914 --> 01:08:26.294
or just to bring it down?

01:08:26.294 --> 01:08:27.224
MATT: "Get rid of it."

01:08:27.224 --> 01:08:29.497
LIAM: I extinguish it completely with a wave of my hand.

01:08:29.497 --> 01:08:30.330
MATT: "That's easy."

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:32.464
He wipes the ash and his palm on him,

01:08:32.464 --> 01:08:35.432
and goes, "All right, get our stuff,"

01:08:35.432 --> 01:08:38.504
and he puts all the things in the back of his chair.

01:08:38.504 --> 01:08:40.094
"Ready to go?"

01:08:40.094 --> 01:08:41.275
LIAM: Yeah.

01:08:41.275 --> 01:08:42.108
LAURA: Yep.

01:08:42.108 --> 01:08:46.134
MATT: "All right, follow me. Come on, Sheila."

01:08:46.134 --> 01:08:48.564
He begins wheeling outside of the alcove

01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:52.224
and heading back into the plains. Now,

01:08:52.224 --> 01:08:54.418
I would like someone to roll another d20 for me, please.

01:08:54.418 --> 01:08:56.144
LAURA: Who rolled before?
LIAM: I did it last time.

01:08:56.144 --> 01:08:57.004
LAURA: Okay, you're up.

01:08:57.004 --> 01:08:58.614
SAM: I'm doing it.

01:08:58.614 --> 01:08:59.997
Don't fuck me, Gil.

01:09:00.974 --> 01:09:02.300
15.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.394
MATT: 15.

01:09:07.634 --> 01:09:12.634
You travel for about

01:09:12.884 --> 01:09:14.559
four or so hours

01:09:14.559 --> 01:09:16.444
into the cold expanse.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.924
The snow fall is still gentle,

01:09:18.924 --> 01:09:20.804
but the temperature is still freezing

01:09:20.804 --> 01:09:23.787
and now that your body has spent an evening in the elements,

01:09:23.787 --> 01:09:27.894
it seems to cut even deeper than it should.

01:09:27.894 --> 01:09:29.577
Uncomfortable as it is,

01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:34.448
Caduceus and Beauregard.

01:09:34.448 --> 01:09:36.007
MARISHA: Oh shit. Oh!

01:09:36.007 --> 01:09:39.354
MATT: You both keep an eye

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:42.154
a little ways to the northwest of where you are.

01:09:43.584 --> 01:09:48.127
And you see something protruding from the snow

01:09:48.127 --> 01:09:52.762
that has a texture unlike the surrounding rock.

01:09:56.754 --> 01:09:58.800
TALIESIN: Daygen, is that normal, that?

01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.633
LAURA: Dagen.

01:09:59.633 --> 01:10:01.066
TALIESIN: Dagen, Dagen.

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:02.589
MATT: "You can call me whatever you want, it's fine."

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.114
TALIESIN: Oh. Dagen.

01:10:04.114 --> 01:10:09.114
MATT: "I mean, it looks like a rock."

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.831
TALIESIN: Does it?
MARISHA: Does it look like

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:12.789
a landmark or like--

01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:16.144
TALIESIN: Is it moving at all?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:10:16.144 --> 01:10:17.304
MATT: "Pretty stationary to me.

01:10:17.304 --> 01:10:18.661
"Want me to go check?"

01:10:18.661 --> 01:10:20.184
TALIESIN: (uncertain noise)

01:10:20.184 --> 01:10:21.334
What does everybody think?

01:10:21.334 --> 01:10:22.442
MATT: Starts making his way over.

01:10:22.442 --> 01:10:23.958
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind.

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:29.038
Let's keep up. Don't separate the party.

01:10:29.038 --> 01:10:31.559
MATT: Okay, as you get closer,

01:10:31.559 --> 01:10:35.915
you see an ice-coated column

01:10:35.915 --> 01:10:38.465
that's protruding about six feet

01:10:38.465 --> 01:10:40.678
from the rest of the surrounding ground

01:10:40.678 --> 01:10:44.774
at an odd angle, like a weird--

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:45.614
MARISHA: Ruin?

01:10:45.614 --> 01:10:47.284
MATT: Monolithic ruin-like column

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:48.774
that's just sticking out.

01:10:48.774 --> 01:10:50.932
MARISHA: Okay, let's go over, yes, yes, yes.

01:10:50.932 --> 01:10:51.857
LAURA: Is this one charted?

01:10:51.857 --> 01:10:53.423
Is it on the map anywhere?

01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:54.411
Did we find a ruin?

01:10:54.411 --> 01:10:57.039
MARISHA: Is this an excavation site?

01:10:57.039 --> 01:10:57.905
TRAVIS: I don't think so,

01:10:57.905 --> 01:11:00.227
if we've been heading north from Balenpost.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.590
LIAM: There could be things
that are not on that map. Uncharted.

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:06.634
MATT: He's been tucking you guys
a little close to the mountain

01:11:06.634 --> 01:11:10.234
to try and keep from being way out open in the plain.

01:11:10.234 --> 01:11:14.266
He's like, "I'm sure I've passed this town again,

01:11:14.266 --> 01:11:17.719
"but generally don't poke too close."

01:11:17.719 --> 01:11:20.086
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:11:20.086 --> 01:11:22.677
MATT: Okay, casting Detect Magic.

01:11:23.674 --> 01:11:26.678
There is a faint magical aura

01:11:26.678 --> 01:11:30.804
about four feet beneath the snow's surface

01:11:30.804 --> 01:11:32.417
where it's poking out of.

01:11:34.579 --> 01:11:38.514
And it has a fairly strong necromantic aura to it.

01:11:39.404 --> 01:11:40.327
TALIESIN: Detect undead.

01:11:41.644 --> 01:11:43.047
MATT: No sense of undead.

01:11:44.304 --> 01:11:46.520
SAM: Detect everything else.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.348
MATT: Detect narrative plot point.

01:11:49.354 --> 01:11:50.694
TALIESIN: There's something weird

01:11:50.694 --> 01:11:54.327
with an undead necromantic vibe

01:11:54.327 --> 01:11:56.996
about four feet underneath this thing.

01:11:56.996 --> 01:11:59.547
MARISHA: How far away is it from us right now?
TALIESIN: Could be dangerous.

01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:01.554
MATT: From where Dagen stopped

01:12:01.554 --> 01:12:02.753
making his advance towards it,

01:12:02.753 --> 01:12:04.574
it's about 15 feet.

01:12:04.574 --> 01:12:05.644
MARISHA: Oh, 15 feet?

01:12:05.644 --> 01:12:07.414
MATT: 15, 20 feet from you.
MARISHA: That's not far.

01:12:07.414 --> 01:12:09.052
SAM: This is all snow, right, Matt?

01:12:09.052 --> 01:12:11.884
Is this dirt rock snow or just snow?

01:12:11.884 --> 01:12:14.014
MATT: It's just snow around you,

01:12:14.014 --> 01:12:16.146
especially after a night of snowfall.

01:12:16.146 --> 01:12:17.194
As you step through,

01:12:17.194 --> 01:12:20.114
your feet occasionally find frozen ground beneath

01:12:20.114 --> 01:12:24.684
and stone, where the ice and snow packed through eventually.

01:12:24.684 --> 01:12:26.244
TALIESIN: Do we want to maybe melt?

01:12:26.244 --> 01:12:28.334
LAURA: Yeah, with like Sacred Flame or something?

01:12:28.334 --> 01:12:30.414
TRAVIS: Before we do that, the column,

01:12:30.414 --> 01:12:31.634
what does the column look like?

01:12:31.634 --> 01:12:34.247
Does it have markings, is it just brick? Stone?

01:12:35.402 --> 01:12:36.861
SAM: Let's go, we go.

01:12:36.861 --> 01:12:37.694
TALIESIN: Keep some distance.

01:12:37.694 --> 01:12:38.664
MATT: You go ahead and you get closer

01:12:38.664 --> 01:12:40.014
and you see

01:12:41.581 --> 01:12:46.574
it has this faint scrolling across the surface.

01:12:46.574 --> 01:12:48.914
It just looks like a rough stone texture,

01:12:48.914 --> 01:12:52.587
but the closer you get, especially you three,

01:12:53.684 --> 01:12:57.544
you can see there's these geometric lines

01:12:57.544 --> 01:12:59.390
that connect around it.

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:02.698
And there are these little

01:13:02.698 --> 01:13:06.490
carved small spaces

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:07.725
on the stone.
MARISHA: On the pillar?

01:13:07.725 --> 01:13:08.870
MATT: On the pillar itself, yeah.

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:10.714
ASHLEY: The lines are on the pillar?

01:13:10.714 --> 01:13:14.289
MATT: Correct. They're carved in it.
LIAM: Necromantic, or just arcane in general?

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.604
MATT: You get the sense, with your experience,

01:13:16.604 --> 01:13:19.294
that these type of designs can be used

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:22.334
to connect elements of arcana.

01:13:22.334 --> 01:13:26.537
Or it could be just design work inspired by.

01:13:27.394 --> 01:13:30.064
TRAVIS: And do the spaces look like damage to the pillar

01:13:30.064 --> 01:13:33.001
or reliefs that an object might fit into?

01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:36.196
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

01:13:36.196 --> 01:13:38.733
TALIESIN: This thing is giving me the heebie jeebies.

01:13:38.733 --> 01:13:39.744
TRAVIS: 22.

01:13:39.744 --> 01:13:41.776
MATT: 22.

01:13:41.776 --> 01:13:43.414
You can tell, as you get a bit closer

01:13:43.414 --> 01:13:46.014
and look over it, that there were a number of settings

01:13:46.014 --> 01:13:48.472
in this that once held

01:13:48.472 --> 01:13:52.961
stones or something smooth and round.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.694
There are multiple places in these designs

01:13:54.694 --> 01:13:57.154
where these, of different sizes it seemed,

01:13:57.154 --> 01:14:00.874
though still roughly around the size of a gold piece,

01:14:00.874 --> 01:14:02.846
where these stones were inset.

01:14:02.846 --> 01:14:04.134
But now you look on the outside

01:14:04.134 --> 01:14:05.794
and you can see bits where the stone

01:14:05.794 --> 01:14:08.404
has been carved and chipped.

01:14:08.404 --> 01:14:11.648
Where somebody has probably pried them out.

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:13.894
LIAM: Anything left behind?

01:14:13.894 --> 01:14:14.754
MATT: Within that space?

01:14:14.754 --> 01:14:16.544
LIAM: In any of the spaces?

01:14:16.544 --> 01:14:18.364
MATT: Any of those spaces that are visible right now, no,

01:14:18.364 --> 01:14:19.877
they are all empty.
LAURA: Maybe beneath the snow.

01:14:19.877 --> 01:14:21.334
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:14:21.334 --> 01:14:22.944
TALIESIN: Let's start melting the snow around it.

01:14:22.944 --> 01:14:25.337
LIAM: Is it icy or snow?

01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:28.094
MATT: It's snow on top,

01:14:28.094 --> 01:14:32.204
but if you start getting close enough to dig underneath,

01:14:32.204 --> 01:14:35.183
about a foot of snow leads to just solid ice.

01:14:35.183 --> 01:14:36.194
LIAM: Okay.

01:14:36.194 --> 01:14:37.394
MARISHA: Before we dive into this,

01:14:37.394 --> 01:14:39.671
remember what Dagen told us--

01:14:41.547 --> 01:14:45.144
SAM: Sometimes savaging isn't worth it.
MARISHA: Isn't worth it, right.

01:14:45.144 --> 01:14:47.784
So before we start--

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:49.668
LAURA: This is not a body.

01:14:49.668 --> 01:14:50.882
MATT: "I did actually say that."

01:14:50.882 --> 01:14:52.607
MARISHA: You did say that, it very wi--

01:14:52.607 --> 01:14:55.250
you were very drunk, but it was very wise.

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:56.266
TALIESIN: It was.

01:14:56.266 --> 01:14:58.696
MATT: "Usually the two work well together."

01:14:58.696 --> 01:15:02.344
MARISHA: I agree. But I think, before we go into this,

01:15:02.344 --> 01:15:04.044
how long are we going to spend time on this

01:15:04.044 --> 01:15:06.724
before we decide to move on?
SAM: A couple days.

01:15:06.724 --> 01:15:07.557
MARISHA: No.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.872
TALIESIN: I'd be okay with no more than an hour.

01:15:11.872 --> 01:15:13.444
MARISHA: No more than an hour.

01:15:13.444 --> 01:15:15.434
LAURA: Maybe it's not, like, an entrance anywhere,

01:15:15.434 --> 01:15:16.824
maybe there's just, like, a pillar.

01:15:16.824 --> 01:15:18.224
It's just a marker or something.

01:15:18.224 --> 01:15:21.404
MARISHA: These things can be rabbit holes.

01:15:21.404 --> 01:15:23.184
They can keep going for forever.

01:15:23.184 --> 01:15:24.894
It depends on what's worth it.

01:15:24.894 --> 01:15:26.244
Why are we here?

01:15:26.244 --> 01:15:27.622
TALIESIN: There's something about four feet down

01:15:27.622 --> 01:15:29.430
and it's giving me a bit of a bad vibe.

01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:32.944
ASHLEY: It could be an extra stone just underneath.

01:15:32.944 --> 01:15:35.404
TRAVIS: Caleb, you couldn't read
any of these markings, right?

01:15:35.404 --> 01:15:36.854
That's not a language--

01:15:36.854 --> 01:15:39.674
LIAM: I assume I would've been able to if it's by sight.

01:15:39.674 --> 01:15:40.824
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:15:41.854 --> 01:15:42.924
LAURA: You don't have to cast anything anymore.

01:15:42.924 --> 01:15:45.468
You can just read things?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:15:45.468 --> 01:15:48.141
LIAM: Well, I mean, I have done a lot of stuff

01:15:48.141 --> 01:15:49.954
for a long time.

01:15:49.954 --> 01:15:51.654
LAURA: How many languages do you speak?

01:15:54.056 --> 01:15:55.159
LIAM: Four.

01:15:56.924 --> 01:15:58.015
SAM: Yeah, but one of them's Pig Latin,

01:15:58.015 --> 01:15:59.103
doesn't really count.
LIAM: 24.

01:15:59.103 --> 01:16:00.186
MATT: 24.

01:16:00.186 --> 01:16:01.467
MARISHA: I can speak five.

01:16:01.467 --> 01:16:02.926
I know more languages than you do.

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:06.616
LAURA: Beau, you're so smart.
TRAVIS: Okay, it's not a competition.

01:16:06.616 --> 01:16:08.399
TALIESIN: It's only not a competition if you win.

01:16:08.399 --> 01:16:09.617
MATT: Best you can assess,

01:16:11.103 --> 01:16:14.764
these designs are meant to connect

01:16:14.764 --> 01:16:17.667
different arcane power sources.

01:16:23.573 --> 01:16:25.148
What bits of

01:16:27.548 --> 01:16:29.181
equation work have been woven

01:16:29.181 --> 01:16:33.544
into the stonework is a little out of your specialty.

01:16:33.544 --> 01:16:36.774
The language is some variation of Draconic

01:16:36.774 --> 01:16:41.071
that you can get the essence of,

01:16:41.071 --> 01:16:43.879
but it's like somebody took

01:16:44.864 --> 01:16:45.994
the language you're familiar with

01:16:45.994 --> 01:16:50.921
and began making their own Pig Latin version of it.

01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:53.398
LIAM: Everybody, take a breather.

01:16:53.398 --> 01:16:54.441
Let me try something.

01:16:54.441 --> 01:16:55.979
I spend 10 minutes, and

01:16:59.671 --> 01:17:00.504
do some muttering

01:17:00.504 --> 01:17:02.994
and wave a bit of soot and salt in the air,

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:05.134
and cast Comprehend Languages,

01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:07.694
and take another look.
MATT: Okay.

01:17:07.694 --> 01:17:09.507
It helps a little bit.

01:17:09.507 --> 01:17:11.454
It's less of a written language

01:17:11.454 --> 01:17:15.336
and more of an arcane equation language,

01:17:15.336 --> 01:17:16.264
if that makes sense.

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.634
So it doesn't give you information

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.504
regarding any speech or ideas that have come across,

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:23.234
but what you are able to ascertain

01:17:23.234 --> 01:17:26.707
is this pillar was used,

01:17:28.114 --> 01:17:29.934
while it has a strong necromantic aura

01:17:29.934 --> 01:17:31.974
that he figured out,

01:17:31.974 --> 01:17:34.613
all of the geometry around it

01:17:34.613 --> 01:17:39.083
has a heavy abjuration feel to it.

01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:43.349
Some sort of defensive, protective magic,

01:17:43.349 --> 01:17:44.954
as of design.

01:17:44.954 --> 01:17:48.634
Though all the gems that are visible appear to be missing.

01:17:48.634 --> 01:17:49.984
MARISHA: We're standing on a tomb.

01:17:51.109 --> 01:17:51.942
TRAVIS: Could be.

01:17:51.942 --> 01:17:53.455
LAURA: What is abjuration stuff?

01:17:54.745 --> 01:17:57.044
What is abjuration stuff?
LIAM: Oh dear, that's

01:17:57.044 --> 01:17:58.144
protection magic.
SAM: You're a magic user.

01:17:58.144 --> 01:17:59.644
You know all about this stuff.

01:18:01.424 --> 01:18:02.684
LAURA: No, the Traveler doesn't tell me,

01:18:02.684 --> 01:18:04.204
like, what kind of magic I'm using.

01:18:04.204 --> 01:18:05.984
He's just like, "Here, here's the magic.

01:18:05.984 --> 01:18:08.400
"You can use it to change your appearance."

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.094
I don't know what it--

01:18:10.094 --> 01:18:11.435
SAM: That's fair.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:12.304 --> 01:18:13.254
MATT: (as Artagan) "That's very true."

01:18:14.374 --> 01:18:15.207
LAURA: Hi.

01:18:15.207 --> 01:18:16.415
TALIESIN: What do you think, Caleb?

01:18:16.415 --> 01:18:17.794
TRAVIS: (surprised noises)

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:21.494
LIAM: Well, it's to keep people out of something.

01:18:21.494 --> 01:18:23.535
I don't know if it's a door or a tomb

01:18:23.535 --> 01:18:24.876
or a gate.
TRAVIS: Oh, this sucks.

01:18:24.876 --> 01:18:27.540
I always want to see what they want to keep us out of.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.373
Let's go.

01:18:28.373 --> 01:18:31.840
ASHLEY: You want me to try to chip away some?

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.184
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, not that.

01:18:33.184 --> 01:18:34.526
LAURA: We could melt the ice.

01:18:34.526 --> 01:18:36.517
SAM: Yeah, what are we talking about?

01:18:36.517 --> 01:18:38.884
Of course we're going to melt the ice.
LIAM: We could melt it. We could dig the snow out.

01:18:38.884 --> 01:18:40.144
TRAVIS: Do it, melt it.

01:18:40.144 --> 01:18:41.064
Melt the ice at least.

01:18:41.064 --> 01:18:44.864
MARISHA: I dealt with a snow clearing brigade.

01:18:44.864 --> 01:18:45.897
TRAVIS: What, with your hand?

01:18:45.897 --> 01:18:49.724
MATT: Dagen goes, "All right, it's
all sorts of interesting,"

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.671
and then wheels his way a safe distance

01:18:51.671 --> 01:18:54.177
from what you guys are doing.

01:18:54.177 --> 01:18:57.572
LIAM: Yeah, like 50 feet back. Come with me.
LAURA: Back up, back up, back up.

01:18:57.572 --> 01:18:59.217
LIAM: So I take out catmint again

01:18:59.217 --> 01:19:02.814
and Frumpkin floats in front of me for a moment

01:19:02.814 --> 01:19:04.754
and then vanishes, and there's a gigantic cat claw,

01:19:04.754 --> 01:19:06.676
and the claw just goes (blows)

01:19:06.676 --> 01:19:08.142
and just starts digging

01:19:08.142 --> 01:19:10.033
huge heaps of snow.
MATT: All right, and you watch

01:19:10.033 --> 01:19:12.964
as the arcane cat claw begins to just carve into the ice,

01:19:12.964 --> 01:19:13.964
and pull it away in chunks

01:19:13.964 --> 01:19:16.934
as it breaks and cracks, and grinds into the sides,

01:19:16.934 --> 01:19:20.264
like a terrifying arcane...

01:19:20.264 --> 01:19:21.234
What are they called?

01:19:21.234 --> 01:19:22.067
TRAVIS: Cat?

01:19:22.067 --> 01:19:23.467
MATT: Sure, yeah.

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:26.864
I was going to say like the ice chisel machines.

01:19:26.864 --> 01:19:28.634
TRAVIS: Oh, snow cat.

01:19:28.634 --> 01:19:29.467
MATT: Goddammit.

01:19:29.467 --> 01:19:31.026
TALIESIN: Still a cat.

01:19:31.026 --> 01:19:32.666
Snow cat claw.

01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:34.664
MATT: There you go.

01:19:34.664 --> 01:19:36.934
A short time, you begin to pull away

01:19:36.934 --> 01:19:39.511
all the snow and ice to reveal more of the pillar.

01:19:39.511 --> 01:19:41.799
And about five or so feet down,

01:19:41.799 --> 01:19:44.294
you can see where a lot of these grooves

01:19:44.294 --> 01:19:49.289
all begin to come to a little larger than a fist-sized

01:19:49.289 --> 01:19:51.762
smooth emerald-like gem,

01:19:51.762 --> 01:19:53.994
that still remains affixed into this pillar.

01:19:54.894 --> 01:19:58.507
LIAM: Are you still getting a read on that from a distance?

01:19:58.507 --> 01:20:00.484
TALIESIN: It's 10 minutes, long gone.

01:20:00.484 --> 01:20:01.906
LIAM: Hold on.

01:20:01.906 --> 01:20:02.824
TALIESIN: But my guess is that--

01:20:02.824 --> 01:20:04.224
SAM: It's just in the ice?

01:20:04.224 --> 01:20:05.144
LAURA: No, it's in the pillar.

01:20:05.144 --> 01:20:07.599
MATT: It's in the pillar.
LAURA: It's one of the stones that didn't get taken out.

01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:10.634
TRAVIS: I think everyone that pulls a gem out just dies.

01:20:10.634 --> 01:20:13.574
LIAM: All right, I'm going to get within 30 feet of it

01:20:13.574 --> 01:20:15.444
and I will cast Detect Magic.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:16.784
MATT: Okay.

01:20:16.784 --> 01:20:20.944
Very strong necromantic energy emanating from this gem.

01:20:20.944 --> 01:20:21.777
LIAM: Oh, boy.

01:20:21.777 --> 01:20:22.869
TRAVIS: Totally take it.

01:20:23.758 --> 01:20:24.774
ASHLEY: I can go grab it,

01:20:24.774 --> 01:20:26.814
just with my bare hand, if we need to.

01:20:26.814 --> 01:20:27.783
TALIESIN: No, I wouldn't.

01:20:27.783 --> 01:20:29.922
SAM: We're going to have to chip it out.

01:20:29.922 --> 01:20:32.444
MATT: Yeah, it would not be easy to remove,

01:20:32.444 --> 01:20:35.138
and it would need to be worked to be removed.

01:20:35.138 --> 01:20:38.819
TRAVIS: This is literally the stupidest
thing we should be doing.

01:20:38.819 --> 01:20:40.104
We should just keep going, right?

01:20:40.104 --> 01:20:42.800
LIAM: This pivoted the entire campaign one,

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.151
what we are fucking with right now.

01:20:44.151 --> 01:20:46.075
TRAVIS: Yep. We should just go.

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:48.325
LIAM: The necromancy thing.
TRAVIS: Just keep going, right?

01:20:49.924 --> 01:20:51.524
MARISHA: How long have we been working?

01:20:53.177 --> 01:20:54.368
TRAVIS: 20, 30 minutes.

01:20:54.368 --> 01:20:56.376
MATT: At the pillar, I'd say about 20 minutes.

01:20:56.376 --> 01:20:59.194
SAM: Yeah, we got 40 minutes.

01:20:59.194 --> 01:21:01.084
TRAVIS: Is the juice worth the squeeze?

01:21:01.084 --> 01:21:03.106
We got like a Mage Hand, right?

01:21:03.106 --> 01:21:04.094
SAM: Sure, that's not going to be able

01:21:04.094 --> 01:21:06.494
to pry something out.

01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:07.867
TRAVIS: Could it take a dagger?

01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:10.443
Doesn't work like that?

01:21:10.443 --> 01:21:11.564
LIAM: I'm going to try another thing.

01:21:11.564 --> 01:21:12.704
Everyone back up again,

01:21:12.704 --> 01:21:14.766
come back 50 feet, 50 feet.

01:21:14.766 --> 01:21:15.675
TRAVIS: 50. Five zero.

01:21:15.675 --> 01:21:18.084
LIAM: Yeah, and I start waving my hands in the air,

01:21:18.084 --> 01:21:21.394
and I will reach out my hand and use Telekinesis

01:21:21.394 --> 01:21:24.974
to pull the gem out.

01:21:24.974 --> 01:21:28.400
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a--

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.344
TRAVIS: And there goes our wizard.

01:21:29.344 --> 01:21:31.508
MATT: It would be a strength check.

01:21:31.508 --> 01:21:33.264
If it gives you a strength value with Telekinesis

01:21:33.264 --> 01:21:34.320
or you would use your--

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.685
LIAM: I think it's my DC.

01:21:35.685 --> 01:21:37.614
"You can try to move an object

01:21:37.614 --> 01:21:39.504
"that weighs up to 1,000 pounds.

01:21:39.504 --> 01:21:40.684
"If it isn't being worn or carried,

01:21:40.684 --> 01:21:43.546
"you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction,

01:21:43.546 --> 01:21:45.501
"but not beyond the range of the spell.

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:47.654
"If the object is worn of carried by a creature,

01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:49.204
"you must make an ability check."

01:21:50.144 --> 01:21:50.977
MATT: Correct.

01:21:50.977 --> 01:21:52.684
LIAM: "Contested by the creature's strength check."

01:21:52.684 --> 01:21:57.684
MATT: Right, so go ahead and roll an intelligence check.

01:21:58.004 --> 01:22:01.071
So roll a d20 and then add your intelligence modifier.

01:22:03.261 --> 01:22:04.194
LIAM: 12.

01:22:04.194 --> 01:22:05.619
MATT: 12.

01:22:05.619 --> 01:22:09.024
As the Telekinesis pulls on it,

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.854
it does not come free.

01:22:11.854 --> 01:22:16.029
However, it begins to pulse slightly.

01:22:16.029 --> 01:22:18.874
MATT: (heartbeat, blast sound)

01:22:18.874 --> 01:22:21.144
There is this darkened shockwave

01:22:21.144 --> 01:22:25.984
that in a split second heads out for a 60 foot radius.

01:22:25.984 --> 01:22:29.009
SAM: No, we're 50 feet away!

01:22:29.009 --> 01:22:30.691
MARISHA: We're 50 feet back.

01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:32.044
MATT: Yep.

01:22:32.044 --> 01:22:33.817
I need everyone to make a constitution
saving throw with this.

01:22:33.817 --> 01:22:35.420
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.326
TRAVIS: Have we learned nothing in five fucking years?

01:22:40.326 --> 01:22:42.313
(laughter)

01:22:42.313 --> 01:22:43.334
LAURA: Did we all just die?

01:22:43.334 --> 01:22:44.685
Did this TPK?

01:22:44.685 --> 01:22:46.034
MARISHA: Nothing.

01:22:46.034 --> 01:22:47.454
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw.

01:22:47.454 --> 01:22:49.028
MATT: Yes, please.
TRAVIS: 22.

01:22:49.028 --> 01:22:51.271
MATT: 22.
LAURA: N-n-n-n-nineteen.

01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:52.104
MATT: Nice.

01:22:52.104 --> 01:22:53.124
LIAM: 14.

01:22:53.124 --> 01:22:54.459
SAM: 14.

01:22:54.459 --> 01:22:55.884
ASHLEY: 22.
MATT: All right.

01:22:55.884 --> 01:22:58.144
TALIESIN: 17.
MARISHA: 16.

01:22:58.144 --> 01:23:02.524
MATT: All right, so raise your hand

01:23:02.524 --> 01:23:05.490
if you got 18 or higher.

01:23:07.263 --> 01:23:08.521
LAURA: Uh oh.
MATT: All right.

01:23:09.357 --> 01:23:11.046
Let me roll the other half of this.

01:23:11.046 --> 01:23:12.676
TRAVIS: The other half of this.

01:23:12.676 --> 01:23:15.522
MARISHA: It's been a joy. It's been a pleasure.

01:23:15.522 --> 01:23:16.474
SAM: This was worth it.

01:23:16.474 --> 01:23:17.484
TRAVIS: It's nothing.

01:23:17.484 --> 01:23:20.432
It's nothing in the middle of nowhere.

01:23:20.432 --> 01:23:23.234
It's 15 out of 20 options.

01:23:23.234 --> 01:23:28.234
MATT: So Yasha, Jester, and Fjord,

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:31.937
you all take 26 points of necrotic damage.

01:23:32.789 --> 01:23:34.522
ASHLEY: I'm resistant, so...

01:23:34.522 --> 01:23:35.474
MATT: So you take half that.

01:23:35.474 --> 01:23:36.307
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:23:36.307 --> 01:23:37.628
LAURA: 26?

01:23:37.628 --> 01:23:40.119
MATT: 26, you take 13.
MARISHA: We're about take 52 points of damage.

01:23:40.119 --> 01:23:42.216
MATT: The rest of you take 52 points of necrotic damage.

01:23:42.216 --> 01:23:44.722
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:23:44.722 --> 01:23:46.968
LAURA: Okay, at least you're not dead.

01:23:46.968 --> 01:23:47.864
But we're all cursed.

01:23:47.864 --> 01:23:50.899
MATT: Daygen also takes that. (laughs)

01:23:54.231 --> 01:23:57.273
LAURA: Matt, it's Dagen. (laughs)

01:23:57.273 --> 01:23:58.106
MATT: Dagen.

01:23:58.106 --> 01:23:59.384
You guys are fucking me up.

01:23:59.384 --> 01:24:00.847
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

01:24:00.847 --> 01:24:02.656
Do you want us to die out here?

01:24:02.656 --> 01:24:04.194
(laughter)

01:24:04.194 --> 01:24:05.654
MATT: I don't even remember what I set it as now.

01:24:05.654 --> 01:24:07.414
Like, it's gone around so much now

01:24:07.414 --> 01:24:09.077
that it's just an amorphous name.

01:24:10.094 --> 01:24:11.539
TRAVIS: Pretty sure it's Dajin.

01:24:11.539 --> 01:24:14.404
LAURA: I remember it being not Dagon so it's Dagen.

01:24:14.404 --> 01:24:16.444
MATT: Right, I was trying to make it as far away from Dagon

01:24:16.444 --> 01:24:18.964
as possible and then I don't even remember what I set it as,

01:24:18.964 --> 01:24:20.344
and now it's just whatever.

01:24:20.344 --> 01:24:22.724
If it's loosely near the name, he'll answer to it

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:23.594
at this point.

01:24:23.594 --> 01:24:25.554
I'm sure he's heard all sorts of variations of it.

01:24:25.554 --> 01:24:26.793
ASHLEY: I'm going to call him Dagoon.

01:24:26.793 --> 01:24:28.144
LAURA: Dagoon?

01:24:28.144 --> 01:24:32.497
MATT: So you all hear this high-pitched, screaming whine

01:24:32.497 --> 01:24:34.654
as this shockwave of dark energy

01:24:34.654 --> 01:24:36.974
just emanates from around it. (boosh)

01:24:36.974 --> 01:24:39.218
And you feel it tear through your body,

01:24:39.218 --> 01:24:41.734
like someone just punched through your soul

01:24:41.734 --> 01:24:42.894
for a brief second.

01:24:42.894 --> 01:24:45.254
Your breath is knocked from you,

01:24:45.254 --> 01:24:47.344
your vision goes black for about a second,

01:24:47.344 --> 01:24:48.664
before suddenly, (gasps),

01:24:48.664 --> 01:24:50.094
you all inhale together as once,

01:24:50.094 --> 01:24:52.464
and fall to your knees coughing. (coughs)

01:24:52.464 --> 01:24:54.889
You see Dagen in his chair like, "(coughs)

01:24:55.901 --> 01:24:58.327
"All right, like I said, don't do that shit!"

01:24:58.327 --> 01:24:59.254
(laughter)

01:24:59.254 --> 01:25:00.828
"I warned you!

01:25:00.828 --> 01:25:02.209
"You even brought it up.

01:25:03.314 --> 01:25:05.234
"I'm getting way back next time."

01:25:06.164 --> 01:25:09.024
LIAM: Caleb says, not even loud enough for anyone to hear:

01:25:09.024 --> 01:25:11.112
(strained) Are we the worst?

01:25:11.112 --> 01:25:12.978
We're the worst, aren't we?
MATT: "Yeah!

01:25:12.978 --> 01:25:13.953
"Yeah, you are."

01:25:13.953 --> 01:25:16.045
SAM: Dagen's alive, though, right?
MATT: Yeah, he's alive.

01:25:16.045 --> 01:25:17.631
LIAM: Dagen's alive, but Daygen died.

01:25:17.631 --> 01:25:19.954
(laughter)

01:25:19.954 --> 01:25:21.134
LAURA: Oh no, Sprinkle!

01:25:21.134 --> 01:25:22.235
Okay, he's fine.

01:25:22.235 --> 01:25:24.734
SAM: (laughs) Sprinkle.

01:25:24.734 --> 01:25:26.742
MATT: Got a revivify diamond ready?

01:25:30.164 --> 01:25:32.354
You look back and the gem is just there,

01:25:32.354 --> 01:25:33.797
where it was before.

01:25:35.004 --> 01:25:36.264
SAM: Oh, it's still there?

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.264
MATT: Yeah.

01:25:37.264 --> 01:25:39.044
TRAVIS: Like, if you don't successfully remove it--

01:25:39.044 --> 01:25:40.424
MARISHA: We haven't done shit to it.

01:25:40.424 --> 01:25:42.179
SAM: Well, let's get it again.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.024
MARISHA: No!

01:25:43.024 --> 01:25:44.214
SAM: We'll just move farther back.

01:25:44.214 --> 01:25:48.684
LAURA: Yeah, we just get like, you know, further away.

01:25:48.684 --> 01:25:49.769
MARISHA: Why though?

01:25:49.769 --> 01:25:51.624
Can anybody tell me why?

01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:52.614
SAM: Because we can have it.

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:55.971
TRAVIS: I walk back 12 feet.

01:25:55.971 --> 01:25:57.095
I'm 62 feet back.

01:25:57.095 --> 01:25:59.578
MATT: 62 feet, okay.

01:25:59.578 --> 01:26:02.204
LAURA: I mean, yeah, I go back 70 feet, just to be safe.

01:26:02.204 --> 01:26:03.344
TALIESIN: I'm going to take 10 minutes,

01:26:03.344 --> 01:26:06.184
and I'm going to cast a healing spell for everyone.

01:26:06.184 --> 01:26:08.092
I can do six people.
TRAVIS: It's so stupid.

01:26:08.092 --> 01:26:10.794
We have crazy shit on a map north of us.

01:26:10.794 --> 01:26:12.264
We should just go.

01:26:12.264 --> 01:26:13.506
SAM: We should...
TALIESIN: We're doing this anyway,

01:26:13.506 --> 01:26:14.555
'cause everyone's hurt.

01:26:14.555 --> 01:26:16.444
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if we need this?

01:26:16.444 --> 01:26:17.657
TRAVIS: We don't.

01:26:17.657 --> 01:26:18.744
That's not going to do anything.

01:26:18.744 --> 01:26:20.144
MATT: Here's the thing.

01:26:20.144 --> 01:26:22.752
Your Telekinesis spell, it only lasts for 10 minutes.

01:26:22.752 --> 01:26:23.854
So if you're going to try this again,

01:26:23.854 --> 01:26:25.004
you either have to let it...

01:26:25.004 --> 01:26:27.857
You're going to wait for Caduceus to do this.

01:26:27.857 --> 01:26:30.414
What are you going to do? Are you going to try it again?

01:26:30.414 --> 01:26:31.296
MARISHA: We'll back up.
LIAM: I was making sure I wasn't dying.

01:26:31.296 --> 01:26:32.219
I wasn't even paying attention.

01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:34.126
LAURA: Try it again, I'll do a Cure...

01:26:34.126 --> 01:26:35.251
Oh, wait.

01:26:35.251 --> 01:26:36.867
TRAVIS: What's your range on your Telekinesis?

01:26:36.867 --> 01:26:37.700
What's the range?

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:38.762
LIAM: It's exactly 60 feet.

01:26:38.762 --> 01:26:39.664
TALIESIN: Oh, then no.

01:26:39.664 --> 01:26:40.597
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, just kind of like...

01:26:40.597 --> 01:26:42.622
LAURA: Yeah, no, but heal him.

01:26:42.622 --> 01:26:43.461
TRAVIS: No, no, no, he's fine.

01:26:43.461 --> 01:26:44.564
LAURA: So he's not going to die.

01:26:44.564 --> 01:26:45.914
LIAM: No, you need to heal me.

01:26:45.914 --> 01:26:48.381
TRAVIS: Turn into a T-Rex.
MARISHA: How does that work, though?

01:26:48.381 --> 01:26:49.931
If he's exactly 60 feet,

01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:51.339
will he still get hit?

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:52.354
MATT: There's one way to find out.

01:26:52.354 --> 01:26:53.454
LIAM: Yeah.

01:26:53.454 --> 01:26:56.134
LAURA: I don't have a Cure Wounds prepared. (laughs)

01:26:56.134 --> 01:26:58.151
So I can't give it to him.

01:26:58.151 --> 01:26:59.795
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:26:59.795 --> 01:27:02.828
(laughter)

01:27:02.828 --> 01:27:07.403
TRAVIS: I will, at 5th-level,

01:27:07.403 --> 01:27:08.913
cast Cure Wounds on Caleb.

01:27:08.913 --> 01:27:11.098
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, that's so sweet.

01:27:12.244 --> 01:27:13.474
TALIESIN: While this is all going on,

01:27:13.474 --> 01:27:16.024
I'm going to step back and just start casting

01:27:16.024 --> 01:27:17.094
Prayer of Healing.

01:27:17.094 --> 01:27:19.494
Raise your hand if you really need it.

01:27:19.494 --> 01:27:20.734
I can take five.
MATT: "I do."

01:27:20.734 --> 01:27:23.787
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four.

01:27:24.834 --> 01:27:26.204
SAM: And you.
LAURA: Use it yourself.

01:27:26.204 --> 01:27:28.475
TALIESIN: I'm the sixth, so...

01:27:29.484 --> 01:27:30.575
SAM: That's all of us.

01:27:30.575 --> 01:27:31.954
TRAVIS: 29 points of healing.

01:27:31.954 --> 01:27:32.909
LIAM: 29.

01:27:32.909 --> 01:27:33.784
LAURA: Do Yasha.

01:27:33.784 --> 01:27:37.007
TALIESIN: Okay, so everyone gets, in 10 minutes,

01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:42.578
If nothing goes terribly wrong and I've backed up.

01:27:42.578 --> 01:27:43.519
MATT: Are you trying it again?

01:27:43.519 --> 01:27:44.481
LIAM: I'm going to.

01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:46.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, everybody's back except Caleb, right?

01:27:46.674 --> 01:27:47.514
LIAM: Yeah, just me.

01:27:47.514 --> 01:27:49.425
I'm going to put a little English on this.

01:27:49.425 --> 01:27:50.594
MATT: Hold that, not yet.

01:27:50.594 --> 01:27:51.554
LAURA: Not yet.

01:27:51.554 --> 01:27:52.889
Okay, wait, I'm going to do--

01:27:52.889 --> 01:27:54.938
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: Okay.

01:27:54.938 --> 01:27:57.644
MARISHA: (laughs)
LIAM: Okay, so here's what I'm going to do.

01:27:57.644 --> 01:28:00.318
Everyone's like 70 or 80 or 90 feet back?

01:28:00.318 --> 01:28:02.043
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we're far enough away.
TRAVIS: I'm 61 feet away.

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:03.227
LAURA: I'm going 80 feet away.

01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:06.233
LIAM: So I'm going within 50 feet,

01:28:06.233 --> 01:28:08.371
and I look at it.

01:28:08.371 --> 01:28:10.924
And then I start running away from it,

01:28:10.924 --> 01:28:12.796
while looking at it.

01:28:12.796 --> 01:28:14.598
And then I cast it, and I jump.

01:28:14.598 --> 01:28:19.515
(laughter)

01:28:19.515 --> 01:28:21.394
TRAVIS: Inertia! Inertia!

01:28:22.452 --> 01:28:25.894
MATT: Okay, I need you to roll two things for me.

01:28:25.894 --> 01:28:29.684
I need you to roll an intelligence check,

01:28:29.684 --> 01:28:31.914
so roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

01:28:31.914 --> 01:28:33.674
LIAM: Oh, that's an eight.
LAURA: Oh no!

01:28:33.674 --> 01:28:37.140
MATT: Okay, the gem...

01:28:38.732 --> 01:28:40.007
doesn't go anywhere,

01:28:40.007 --> 01:28:42.964
and then (blows) another shockwave breaks apart.

01:28:42.964 --> 01:28:46.174
Roll a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage,

01:28:46.174 --> 01:28:47.547
because you're not watching where you're running.

01:28:47.547 --> 01:28:49.167
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: Oh, god.

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:54.911
LIAM: One was a 20 on that same die,
but a four on the other.

01:28:54.911 --> 01:28:55.919
MATT: A four.

01:28:55.919 --> 01:28:58.487
LIAM: Wait-wait-wait, plus two, it's a six.
MATT: Six.

01:28:58.487 --> 01:29:00.467
You turn-- it doesn't work!

01:29:00.467 --> 01:29:02.434
You go to jump and your foot just hits

01:29:02.434 --> 01:29:04.474
a big old chunk of ice

01:29:04.474 --> 01:29:06.108
and you just skid on the ground.

01:29:06.108 --> 01:29:09.149
And then the shockwave hits you a second time.
LIAM: Does it go over my head?

01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:10.197
MATT: No, no.

01:29:10.197 --> 01:29:12.054
(laughter)

01:29:12.054 --> 01:29:13.954
I need you to roll another constitution
saving throw for me, Caleb.

01:29:13.954 --> 01:29:16.394
LAURA: Oh no, what have we done?

01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:19.544
LIAM: It's better, oh, it's much better, much better.

01:29:19.544 --> 01:29:20.494
Yeah, that's going to clear it.

01:29:20.494 --> 01:29:23.904
That's 17, 21.

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:25.985
21.

01:29:27.474 --> 01:29:29.284
TRAVIS: We're going to try it one more time, right?

01:29:29.284 --> 01:29:30.417
SAM: We have to.

01:29:30.417 --> 01:29:31.864
(laughter)

01:29:31.864 --> 01:29:33.372
TRAVIS: We got to get this thing.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:29:33.372 --> 01:29:35.614
MATT: Okay, so you do succeed,

01:29:35.614 --> 01:29:37.936
which means that you only take 24 points

01:29:37.936 --> 01:29:40.004
of necrotic damage.

01:29:40.004 --> 01:29:40.837
LIAM: Okay.

01:29:41.894 --> 01:29:44.127
TALIESIN: And then a minute after that...

01:29:44.127 --> 01:29:45.812
MATT: As you get back up.

01:29:45.812 --> 01:29:47.467
MARISHA: It was 27.
TALIESIN: It was what?

01:29:47.467 --> 01:29:48.300
MARISHA: 27.

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:51.154
MATT: The inside of your whole body just vibrating

01:29:51.154 --> 01:29:53.864
and pulsing with this deep-set pain,

01:29:53.864 --> 01:29:56.004
like an aching bone bruise,

01:29:56.004 --> 01:29:58.072
but it's all over.

01:29:58.072 --> 01:29:59.244
Your eyes are bloodshot,

01:29:59.244 --> 01:30:01.919
and the vessels in your eyes have in some places burst,

01:30:01.919 --> 01:30:04.104
and now the whites of your eyes are a deep red.

01:30:04.104 --> 01:30:05.274
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:08.483
MATT: All the veins in your neck and like bulging right now,

01:30:08.483 --> 01:30:10.149
and you hear Dagen go,

01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:13.604
"What's wrong with you?"

01:30:13.604 --> 01:30:17.059
LIAM: Caleb gets up, and he takes his coat off in the cold,

01:30:17.059 --> 01:30:19.685
and he throws it down 70 feet away.

01:30:19.685 --> 01:30:20.554
TRAVIS: Now it's a point of pride.

01:30:20.554 --> 01:30:22.513
LIAM: He rolls up his sleeves.
TRAVIS: Let's go!

01:30:22.513 --> 01:30:24.741
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait!
TALIESIN: Take your 27.

01:30:24.741 --> 01:30:26.044
LIAM: No, I am far away from it.

01:30:26.044 --> 01:30:28.954
LAURA: No, I'm going to Enhance Ability.

01:30:30.168 --> 01:30:31.175
SAM: It won't work.

01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:32.350
It's a spell.
LIAM: No, no, no.

01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:35.557
(yelling) New does not mean better!

01:30:35.557 --> 01:30:39.314
And I pull catmint and I make Cat's Ire appear again,

01:30:39.314 --> 01:30:42.495
which goes 120 feet and is a lot stronger

01:30:42.495 --> 01:30:44.952
than Telekinesis contested.

01:30:44.952 --> 01:30:48.724
And the hand flies out and grabs it and pulls,

01:30:48.724 --> 01:30:50.945
from <i>very</i> far away.
MATT: Okay.

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:52.478
LIAM: 80 feet away.
MATT: Okay.

01:30:52.478 --> 01:30:53.786
LIAM: 90 feet.
MATT: Okay.

01:30:53.786 --> 01:30:56.396
100 feet away.
MATT: Okay, okay, okay!

01:30:56.396 --> 01:30:59.379
TRAVIS: Caleb's running backwards,
and we all just keep up with him.

01:30:59.379 --> 01:31:00.220
(laughter)

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.420
"What are you doing?!"
LAURA: I grab his coat, "Wait!"

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:04.224
LIAM: It has a strength of 26.

01:31:04.224 --> 01:31:07.780
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll a d20 and then add--

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:10.346
LIAM: Plus eight according to the spell.
MATT: Yeah, it'll be a plus eight modifier.

01:31:10.346 --> 01:31:12.100
MARISHA: I just pass the flask to Yasha as I watch.
LIAM: 26.

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:14.541
TRAVIS: Woo! 26.
MATT: 26.

01:31:16.674 --> 01:31:17.991
The gem does not come free.

01:31:17.991 --> 01:31:19.402
(sighing)
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:31:19.402 --> 01:31:23.422
MATT: And (boom) another energy pulse comes off it,

01:31:24.814 --> 01:31:27.737
catching, thankfully nobody in the radius.

01:31:29.044 --> 01:31:31.882
LIAM: He makes a snowball and throws it.

01:31:33.598 --> 01:31:36.217
It falls halfway there.

01:31:38.634 --> 01:31:40.270
MATT: Yeah, that's just not coming free

01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:42.874
through physical means.

01:31:42.874 --> 01:31:45.304
LIAM: I want a necromantic emerald.

01:31:45.304 --> 01:31:46.839
MARISHA: For what?

01:31:46.839 --> 01:31:50.024
SAM: I can put a bomb in it and blow it up.

01:31:50.024 --> 01:31:54.024
MARISHA: Okay. None of us knew
this thing existed 20 minutes ago.

01:31:54.024 --> 01:31:55.044
TALIESIN: I'm ready to walk away.

01:31:55.044 --> 01:31:56.883
TRAVIS: Yasha, can't you just walk up and dispel it?

01:31:56.883 --> 01:31:59.004
MATT: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:31:59.004 --> 01:32:01.010
MARISHA: I am not having Yasha walk up

01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:02.604
and hit it with her sword.

01:32:02.604 --> 01:32:05.319
MARISHA: As everyone's having this conversation,

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:07.854
and you're just looking around, and
you see through the ice and things

01:32:07.854 --> 01:32:09.354
that have been pulled back,

01:32:09.354 --> 01:32:10.757
there's bones.

01:32:11.874 --> 01:32:13.824
TALIESIN: Detect undead.

01:32:13.824 --> 01:32:15.228
MATT: No undead.
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:32:15.228 --> 01:32:16.453
TRAVIS: Just dead-dead.

01:32:16.453 --> 01:32:18.752
MARISHA: Just dead-dead. Just really dead.

01:32:18.752 --> 01:32:20.744
MATT: But you get the sense a lot of people

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:22.906
have gone through this exact process.

01:32:22.906 --> 01:32:25.212
LAURA: Oh, wow.
LIAM: The other idiots.

01:32:25.212 --> 01:32:27.203
TRAVIS: The other people that rolled 15.

01:32:27.203 --> 01:32:30.034
ASHLEY: But somebody got to some of the stones.

01:32:30.034 --> 01:32:32.634
LAURA: Yeah, but this is the big one.
TALIESIN: Those might not have been the same stones.

01:32:32.634 --> 01:32:34.564
LIAM: This is the papa.
TALIESIN: I think those are the people

01:32:34.564 --> 01:32:36.459
who were trying to get this stone.

01:32:36.459 --> 01:32:38.102
I think they had a bad day.

01:32:39.341 --> 01:32:41.266
I'm ready to walk away.
MARISHA: How long has it been?

01:32:41.266 --> 01:32:42.724
TRAVIS: We are terrible at this game.

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:44.774
MATT: At this point, about 45 minutes.

01:32:44.774 --> 01:32:46.969
MARISHA: You guys have 15 more minutes.

01:32:47.855 --> 01:32:49.744
LAURA: Can I look at some of the bones?

01:32:49.744 --> 01:32:51.998
Are there any stuff on the body?

01:32:51.998 --> 01:32:54.484
TRAVIS: You have to dispel it first, if you can.

01:32:54.484 --> 01:32:56.976
I don't even know how that shit works.
Just don't be point-blank.

01:32:56.976 --> 01:32:59.507
MATT: You look, and what bone shards are being exposed

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:04.448
look to be like arm bones. We're talking humeruses

01:33:06.282 --> 01:33:08.307
and femurs,

01:33:08.307 --> 01:33:10.854
and parts of ribs, that are all encased in ice

01:33:10.854 --> 01:33:13.094
that was then broken and pulled away by the cat's claw

01:33:13.094 --> 01:33:15.684
to reveal this pillar.

01:33:15.684 --> 01:33:17.320
This pillar's been here a while,

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:20.224
and it looks like some folks who have found it in the past,

01:33:20.224 --> 01:33:22.053
got greedy and went a little further

01:33:22.053 --> 01:33:23.424
towards the base of the pillar.

01:33:23.424 --> 01:33:26.456
And at first glance, looking around,

01:33:26.456 --> 01:33:28.561
make an investigation check for me.

01:33:30.032 --> 01:33:32.464
TRAVIS: Got greedy. (explosion)

01:33:32.464 --> 01:33:35.343
LAURA: (squeakily) Seven.
MARISHA: When Matt spells out everything.

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:39.334
MATT: You gather, based on the bone fragments here,

01:33:39.334 --> 01:33:41.854
there's at least four corpses.

01:33:41.854 --> 01:33:43.319
LAURA: Wow.
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:33:43.319 --> 01:33:47.597
MATT: Just in the cat's claw pulled aside debris.

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:52.424
You don't see anything of worth that isn't visible.

01:33:52.424 --> 01:33:54.890
The rest of it's under thick ice.

01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:56.748
TRAVIS: He's like, I don't know how else to tell you.

01:33:56.748 --> 01:33:59.484
MARISHA: I wrote "honey pot" on a sign,

01:33:59.484 --> 01:34:01.314
and I posted it 10 feet away.

01:34:01.314 --> 01:34:02.946
TRAVIS: You assholes did this three times.

01:34:02.946 --> 01:34:04.663
We leave, we go.
LAURA: We go.

01:34:04.663 --> 01:34:06.784
SAM: Wait, wait, but before we leave,

01:34:06.784 --> 01:34:10.219
Jester, paint on the pillar,

01:34:10.219 --> 01:34:14.712
"do not touch" or something like that.

01:34:14.712 --> 01:34:15.989
We'll at least pay it forward.

01:34:15.989 --> 01:34:18.327
TALIESIN: Don't touch that pillar.
MATT: That would've stopped you guys.

01:34:18.327 --> 01:34:20.494
TALIESIN: Don't touch the pillar.
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, true.

01:34:20.494 --> 01:34:22.734
TALIESIN: We don't know how much it
takes to set this thing off,

01:34:22.734 --> 01:34:24.714
just don't touch the pillar.

01:34:24.714 --> 01:34:25.734
LAURA: Okay.

01:34:25.734 --> 01:34:27.194
TALIESIN: That should just be a rule.

01:34:27.194 --> 01:34:28.884
LAURA: Then how will I warn anyone?

01:34:28.884 --> 01:34:30.117
TALIESIN: You won't.

01:34:30.117 --> 01:34:31.759
The bones will warn people.

01:34:31.759 --> 01:34:35.304
LAURA: Caduceus, you know, he's a really good guy,

01:34:35.304 --> 01:34:37.014
and if he says we shouldn't warn people--

01:34:37.014 --> 01:34:39.434
SAM: Why wouldn't we warn people?
TALIESIN: We can. We're warning people.

01:34:39.434 --> 01:34:40.267
There's dead people.

01:34:40.267 --> 01:34:41.809
SAM: All right, well, we'll pile up the bodies.

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.792
ASHLEY: We can set up the bones
and then put a sign on the bones,

01:34:44.792 --> 01:34:46.413
like, "This will happen to you."

01:34:46.413 --> 01:34:48.096
TALIESIN: This is exactly--

01:34:48.096 --> 01:34:50.912
I feel like this says it. I really--

01:34:50.912 --> 01:34:52.980
TRAVIS: "This could be you. Don't touch!"

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.254
ASHLEY: I sort of prop up some of the bodies,

01:34:55.254 --> 01:34:57.704
even though it's bones, they don't make sense.

01:34:57.704 --> 01:35:00.714
MATT: Yeah, it's just a mish-mash of splintered bones

01:35:00.714 --> 01:35:02.227
and frozen ice chunks.

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:06.214
It looks like the bottom of your
ice drawer in your freezer.

01:35:06.214 --> 01:35:08.083
It's just jammed in there.

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:09.130
TRAVIS: What the fuck does yours--

01:35:09.130 --> 01:35:10.338
LAURA: I feel like I could draw on the pillar.

01:35:10.338 --> 01:35:13.664
MATT: It's a mess.
SAM: Just leave. It's fine.

01:35:13.664 --> 01:35:18.174
TALIESIN: Let's get moving. We've lost some time.

01:35:18.174 --> 01:35:19.206
TRAVIS: An hour, we lost an hour.

01:35:19.206 --> 01:35:20.934
TALIESIN: We lost an hour against people who are moving.

01:35:20.934 --> 01:35:22.175
MARISHA: 15 minutes to be exact.

01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:25.524
LAURA: I'm going to take some paint and draw on the pillar.

01:35:25.524 --> 01:35:30.394
I'm just going to write, "Big emerald here."

01:35:30.394 --> 01:35:32.367
And I'm going to paint a little arrow pointing down.

01:35:32.367 --> 01:35:34.567
LIAM: Oh, that's murder.

01:35:35.883 --> 01:35:37.866
That's going to bring people right to that.

01:35:37.866 --> 01:35:40.580
LAURA: Well, they should be smarter than that, really.

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:45.094
TRAVIS: Jester, I don't know. That seems like a bit much.

01:35:45.094 --> 01:35:46.584
TALIESIN: I'll actually say if I had seen that,

01:35:46.584 --> 01:35:48.374
I wouldn't have touched it.
LAURA: Right?

01:35:48.374 --> 01:35:49.358
TRAVIS: I would've.

01:35:49.358 --> 01:35:50.399
LAURA: Really?
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:35:50.399 --> 01:35:51.314
LAURA: Really, Fjord?

01:35:51.314 --> 01:35:53.174
LIAM: That's like a cave that says free cupcakes.

01:35:53.174 --> 01:35:54.254
That's not a good idea.

01:35:54.254 --> 01:35:57.656
LAURA: Oh well, I guess when you say it like that.

01:35:57.656 --> 01:35:58.804
TRAVIS: It all depends.

01:35:58.804 --> 01:36:01.560
LIAM: You just have to attack it
from the right angle sometimes.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.738
MATT: (laughs)

01:36:03.738 --> 01:36:05.688
MARISHA: That might be one of the most

01:36:05.688 --> 01:36:07.754
morally ambiguous thing you've done.
LAURA: All right, right underneath there,

01:36:07.754 --> 01:36:09.763
I'll write, "j/k, blah!"

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:12.550
(laughter)

01:36:13.523 --> 01:36:17.198
MARISHA: That's somehow even more confusing.

01:36:17.198 --> 01:36:18.974
TRAVIS: Who's JK?

01:36:18.974 --> 01:36:21.087
Ancient wizard JK.

01:36:22.554 --> 01:36:24.084
MARISHA: What does it mean?

01:36:24.084 --> 01:36:25.354
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Moving on.

01:36:25.354 --> 01:36:27.504
TRAVIS: On the road.
MATT: Gathering yourselves,

01:36:27.504 --> 01:36:31.448
Dagen's like, "All right, second day."

01:36:31.448 --> 01:36:34.834
(laughter)

01:36:34.834 --> 01:36:36.659
"Let's get going."

01:36:36.659 --> 01:36:38.624
LIAM: Yeah, as everyone starts walking away

01:36:38.624 --> 01:36:41.492
Caleb whips around irked and casts Dispel Magic

01:36:41.492 --> 01:36:43.740
at sixth level at the emerald.

01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:45.173
MATT: At sixth level?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:36:46.904 --> 01:36:48.304
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20

01:36:48.304 --> 01:36:50.054
and add your intelligence modifier.

01:36:51.366 --> 01:36:53.416
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15.

01:36:54.314 --> 01:36:56.335
You cast Dispel Magic. It has no effect.

01:36:56.335 --> 01:36:57.368
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:36:57.368 --> 01:36:59.690
(laughter)

01:36:59.690 --> 01:37:01.434
SAM: We lost.
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay,

01:37:01.434 --> 01:37:02.959
we'll probably come back by this way.

01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:04.512
We'll get it another day.

01:37:04.512 --> 01:37:06.451
LAURA: We're going to come back and it'll be gone

01:37:06.451 --> 01:37:08.134
and we'll know somebody did it.

01:37:09.076 --> 01:37:11.139
TRAVIS: You got it loose for them.

01:37:11.139 --> 01:37:12.501
MATT: You swallow your pride a bit,

01:37:12.501 --> 01:37:15.397
and bruised, spiritually.

01:37:16.406 --> 01:37:17.954
MARISHA: I swear to fuck if Molly shows up

01:37:17.954 --> 01:37:20.728
holding a giant emerald, I'm going to be so pissed.

01:37:20.728 --> 01:37:24.803
(laughter)

01:37:24.803 --> 01:37:27.000
LIAM: I just look at it and say:

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.746
I killed Vokodo.

01:37:28.746 --> 01:37:30.218
(laughter)

01:37:30.218 --> 01:37:31.418
Not you.

01:37:33.785 --> 01:37:37.314
MATT: The pillar's the big bad, guys.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:37.314 --> 01:37:39.394
MATT: You continue the rest of your day trekking northward,

01:37:39.394 --> 01:37:40.627
with fair weather.

01:37:42.281 --> 01:37:45.096
Keeping your pride as best intact as you can,

01:37:45.096 --> 01:37:48.104
'til the day comes to a close and Dagen's like,

01:37:48.104 --> 01:37:50.345
"All right, time to start setting up camp again."

01:37:50.345 --> 01:37:53.129
TALIESIN: Actually, do we want to have
a conversation about setting up camp?

01:37:53.129 --> 01:37:53.962
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:53.962 --> 01:37:55.634
MARISHA: Did he just use his sixth level spell

01:37:55.634 --> 01:37:57.339
to try and get an emerald?

01:37:57.339 --> 01:37:58.472
LIAM: I don't need--

01:37:59.614 --> 01:38:00.955
We're good.

01:38:00.955 --> 01:38:03.478
(laughter)

01:38:03.478 --> 01:38:05.584
TALIESIN: Should we mention that we have options?

01:38:05.584 --> 01:38:07.129
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.962
LIAM: We can do whatever we need.

01:38:07.962 --> 01:38:09.734
Do you want the dome, do you want to go plush?

01:38:09.734 --> 01:38:10.567
TRAVIS: The dome's great.

01:38:10.567 --> 01:38:12.004
TALIESIN: Well, we can go plush though.

01:38:12.004 --> 01:38:15.840
LAURA: If we go plush, people probably can't scry on us.

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.404
TALIESIN: And we probably will feel better in the morning.

01:38:18.404 --> 01:38:19.544
MARISHA: If we go plush now,

01:38:19.544 --> 01:38:21.434
we might see how the magic reacts

01:38:21.434 --> 01:38:23.093
before shit gets hairy.

01:38:23.093 --> 01:38:25.014
TALIESIN: Yep.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

01:38:25.014 --> 01:38:28.088
TALIESIN: Yeah, we open it up, let the cat go in, close it,

01:38:28.088 --> 01:38:30.254
reopen it, see if the cat comes out okay.

01:38:30.254 --> 01:38:33.409
LAURA: Like an octopus.
TALIESIN: Or a magic box. Yeah.

01:38:33.409 --> 01:38:34.242
What?

01:38:35.754 --> 01:38:38.471
LIAM: Octopus is very slow.
MARISHA: Speaking of magic getting hairy.

01:38:39.354 --> 01:38:40.554
LAURA: Yeah, that's why I'm saying,

01:38:40.554 --> 01:38:43.404
maybe it's filled up with water, you don't know.

01:38:43.404 --> 01:38:45.134
LIAM: Super funny though, too.

01:38:45.134 --> 01:38:45.967
MATT: What was your question?

01:38:45.967 --> 01:38:47.827
MARISHA: The underwater level, such a bitch.

01:38:48.874 --> 01:38:51.084
Did we see anything weird

01:38:51.084 --> 01:38:54.234
with any of their magic that they just did at the emerald?

01:38:54.234 --> 01:38:56.013
MATT: Nothing caught your eye as out of the ordinary.

01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:59.004
LIAM: You mean like not working?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:38:59.004 --> 01:39:00.304
Okay.

01:39:00.304 --> 01:39:02.954
MATT: The spells seemed to have functioned as intended.

01:39:02.954 --> 01:39:06.604
There was no signs of any oddity.

01:39:06.604 --> 01:39:07.437
TALIESIN: All right.

01:39:10.503 --> 01:39:12.984
This one will be a little weird
though 'cause it is dimensional,

01:39:12.984 --> 01:39:15.048
so maybe things will get weird.

01:39:15.048 --> 01:39:15.881
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:39:15.881 --> 01:39:17.306
TALIESIN: But let's find out.

01:39:19.144 --> 01:39:20.749
TRAVIS: Cah-leb?

01:39:20.749 --> 01:39:22.774
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

01:39:22.774 --> 01:39:26.156
All right, so I will shove Calianna's wand into the snow

01:39:26.156 --> 01:39:28.884
and carefully, so they don't disappear into the snow,

01:39:28.884 --> 01:39:31.384
put all of the appropriate pieces

01:39:32.534 --> 01:39:35.036
and the door goes-- (whoosh)

01:39:36.315 --> 01:39:37.997
MATT: "Oh, son of a bitch.

01:39:39.344 --> 01:39:40.767
"You can make doors."

01:39:43.133 --> 01:39:44.574
TALIESIN: Maybe you can make the rest of a house,

01:39:44.574 --> 01:39:46.113
'cause that would be really convenient right now.

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:47.594
MATT: "That'd be really convenient,

01:39:47.594 --> 01:39:49.919
"but you know, mages are weird, I guess."

01:39:49.919 --> 01:39:52.134
LIAM: The thing is, we don't always know

01:39:52.134 --> 01:39:53.554
that I will be able to accommodate us,

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:55.604
so we wanted to go at least one night

01:39:55.604 --> 01:39:57.216
to learn from you.

01:39:57.216 --> 01:39:59.944
And we've learned from you, so much,

01:39:59.944 --> 01:40:01.634
especially today.

01:40:01.634 --> 01:40:04.314
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, I'd say so."

01:40:04.314 --> 01:40:09.265
LIAM: So as recompense for your trouble, so sorry,

01:40:09.265 --> 01:40:12.064
we'd love for you to come stay with us here.

01:40:12.064 --> 01:40:13.431
Let me just send my cat in,

01:40:13.431 --> 01:40:15.874
to make sure everything is all right.

01:40:15.874 --> 01:40:17.953
MATT: (hesitantly) "Okay."
LIAM: I summon Frumpkin.

01:40:17.953 --> 01:40:19.903
MATT: "Is he always this weird?"
ALL: Yes.

01:40:19.903 --> 01:40:21.751
MATT: "Okay."

01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:23.992
LIAM: I tell Frumpkin,

01:40:24.925 --> 01:40:27.554
go up to the top and down,

01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:30.044
and give it a look-see.

01:40:30.044 --> 01:40:32.516
And I send Frumpkin.
(tippy tap feet noises)

01:40:32.516 --> 01:40:34.111
TALIESIN: Close the door.

01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:37.478
MATT: Now can you see the interior
of the tower from the door that's open?

01:40:37.478 --> 01:40:39.724
LIAM: Well, I can see into the hallway, right?

01:40:39.724 --> 01:40:41.534
MATT: Right, yeah.

01:40:41.534 --> 01:40:42.367
Cool. All right,

01:40:42.367 --> 01:40:47.042
so you send Frumpkin into the inside of the tower.

01:40:48.336 --> 01:40:49.993
Seems fine.
TALIESIN: Close the door.

01:40:51.124 --> 01:40:53.374
LIAM: Is there a door? Is there a physical door?

01:40:54.534 --> 01:40:55.367
MATT: It's up to you.

01:40:55.367 --> 01:40:57.491
It's not so much a physical door more than it's

01:40:57.491 --> 01:41:00.625
a shimmering door-like arch

01:41:00.625 --> 01:41:02.482
with like a threshold.

01:41:02.482 --> 01:41:04.604
You can adjust the visual of it if you want to,

01:41:04.604 --> 01:41:06.654
or make it invisible if you'd like.
LIAM: When we go in, I can make it--

01:41:06.654 --> 01:41:08.095
MATT: You can make it vanish, yeah.

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:09.090
Correct.

01:41:09.090 --> 01:41:11.094
So I'm asking, are you having it visible

01:41:11.094 --> 01:41:12.204
or are you having it purely--

01:41:12.204 --> 01:41:14.843
LIAM: I will make it vanish for us all.

01:41:14.843 --> 01:41:16.351
MATT: Okay.

01:41:16.351 --> 01:41:18.726
Frumpkin goes and about...

01:41:20.292 --> 01:41:21.508
eight or so minutes later,

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:25.654
Frumpkin emerges from the inside of the tower. (meows)

01:41:25.654 --> 01:41:27.114
Seems to be positive.

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:29.604
TRAVIS: I'll summon the sword and I'll cast See Invisibility

01:41:29.604 --> 01:41:32.181
and do a 360 and see if we're being watched--

01:41:32.181 --> 01:41:33.530
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: -- as this is being summoned.

01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:36.964
MATT: The doorway gives a stronger glow,

01:41:36.964 --> 01:41:38.215
just in the proximity of it.

01:41:38.215 --> 01:41:41.217
It's almost like changing the filter with a candle nearby,

01:41:41.217 --> 01:41:43.284
all of a sudden it gets brighter.

01:41:43.284 --> 01:41:45.154
But looking around you, nothing else catches your attention.

01:41:45.154 --> 01:41:46.204
TRAVIS: No spheres?

01:41:46.204 --> 01:41:47.387
MATT: No spheres, no.

01:41:48.872 --> 01:41:51.639
TRAVIS: We seem to be unwatched for the moment.

01:41:53.714 --> 01:41:56.442
LIAM: All right, well, Dagen, join us for dinner?

01:41:57.504 --> 01:41:58.895
MATT: (skeptically) "Sure."

01:42:00.338 --> 01:42:02.398
LIAM: Start leading the way in.

01:42:02.398 --> 01:42:03.336
MATT: As you guys make your way in,

01:42:03.336 --> 01:42:08.068
Dagen, with a little bit of apprehension,

01:42:08.068 --> 01:42:10.717
passes through and as soon as he gets inside goes,

01:42:11.564 --> 01:42:13.337
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

01:42:13.337 --> 01:42:15.964
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:42:15.964 --> 01:42:18.597
MATT: "Why the fuck did we sleep in the ice last night?"

01:42:19.634 --> 01:42:21.094
TALIESIN: This is not every night.

01:42:21.094 --> 01:42:24.093
This is just in case.
LAURA: Learning. We were learning.

01:42:24.093 --> 01:42:25.834
LIAM: When in Eiselcross.

01:42:28.027 --> 01:42:29.134
MATT: "How did--?!"

01:42:29.134 --> 01:42:30.924
MARISHA: Think "up."

01:42:30.924 --> 01:42:32.034
MATT: "Where are the stairs?"

01:42:32.034 --> 01:42:33.547
ALL: Just think up.

01:42:34.634 --> 01:42:35.467
TALIESIN: Up.

01:42:36.834 --> 01:42:37.907
MATT: "Whoa."

01:42:37.907 --> 01:42:39.984
(laughter)

01:42:39.984 --> 01:42:41.514
He starts to glide.

01:42:41.514 --> 01:42:43.481
Him and the chair lifting without issue.

01:42:43.481 --> 01:42:44.489
TRAVIS: Awesome.
MATT: He's like,

01:42:44.489 --> 01:42:46.497
"Well, I guess I don't
need that feature for now."

01:42:46.497 --> 01:42:49.334
He sets one of the little

01:42:49.334 --> 01:42:53.053
glowing, orb-looking panels in the side of the chair

01:42:53.053 --> 01:42:55.576
and he starts continuing to float up with you.

01:42:55.576 --> 01:42:57.367
"This is all kinds of wild.

01:42:58.484 --> 01:43:00.243
"What's for dinner?"

01:43:00.243 --> 01:43:02.250
TALIESIN: We have guest rooms, right?

01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:03.674
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:43:03.674 --> 01:43:05.164
What is for dinner?

01:43:05.164 --> 01:43:07.524
LIAM: What would you like, Caduceus?

01:43:07.524 --> 01:43:08.357
Your call.

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.969
TALIESIN: A bit of everything.

01:43:13.969 --> 01:43:15.827
I think-- ooh.

01:43:15.827 --> 01:43:16.785
Mac and cheese.

01:43:16.785 --> 01:43:18.782
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh, that sounds good.

01:43:18.782 --> 01:43:19.804
MARISHA: That does sound really good.

01:43:19.804 --> 01:43:21.054
LAURA: I was thinking chili.

01:43:21.054 --> 01:43:23.277
Doesn't it sound like that would
be good on like a snowy--

01:43:23.277 --> 01:43:24.634
TALIESIN: We can do both together,

01:43:24.634 --> 01:43:26.271
I think that'd be really good for all.
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:43:26.271 --> 01:43:27.584
SAM: Some collards.

01:43:27.584 --> 01:43:31.407
MATT: "I'm so ready for this meal."

01:43:32.892 --> 01:43:36.274
LIAM: I hover in the salon, the library chamber

01:43:36.274 --> 01:43:39.114
with all of us, and I fall out of the central column

01:43:39.114 --> 01:43:41.094
and walk over and pull a rope pull

01:43:41.094 --> 01:43:42.594
by the main fireplace here,

01:43:42.594 --> 01:43:45.984
with the stained glass in the motif of Molly's coat.

01:43:45.984 --> 01:43:49.214
And a cat comes out of the little arch next to it,

01:43:49.214 --> 01:43:51.832
and I say: <i>Ach</i>, Rudy, good.

01:43:51.832 --> 01:43:53.944
We are going to have mac and cheese

01:43:53.944 --> 01:43:57.168
and then a lot of vegetables, and quinoa.

01:43:57.168 --> 01:43:59.304
As much as quinoa as we have at the moment.

01:43:59.304 --> 01:44:00.562
MARISHA: And chili.

01:44:00.562 --> 01:44:02.688
LIAM: And chili. Vegetarian chili tonight, though.

01:44:02.688 --> 01:44:04.206
MATT: (meows)

01:44:04.206 --> 01:44:05.884
ASHLEY: Well, also some pancakes.

01:44:05.884 --> 01:44:08.118
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:44:08.118 --> 01:44:09.686
TALIESIN: Only seems fair to get some bacon.
LAURA: And some waffles, Rudy.

01:44:09.686 --> 01:44:10.929
Waffles sound good, too.

01:44:10.929 --> 01:44:12.495
Cornbread waffles!

01:44:12.495 --> 01:44:15.779
Cornbread waffles, Rudy, to dip in the chili.
TRAVIS: Cornbread waffles! Cornbread waffles.

01:44:15.779 --> 01:44:17.564
LIAM: And also waffle cornbread.

01:44:17.564 --> 01:44:19.104
MARISHA: Does such thing exist?

01:44:19.104 --> 01:44:20.434
LAURA: Why not?

01:44:20.434 --> 01:44:21.309
MARISHA: In real life?

01:44:21.309 --> 01:44:22.765
I want that, though, now.
TRAVIS: If the cats can't make it,

01:44:22.765 --> 01:44:23.751
I mean, who can?

01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:24.954
MARISHA: I want it.

01:44:24.954 --> 01:44:26.463
LAURA: Sounds good, doesn't it?

01:44:26.463 --> 01:44:28.447
LIAM: Ah, also one plate--
MARISHA: So good.

01:44:28.447 --> 01:44:32.880
LIAM: --of bacon, real bacon for our guest.

01:44:34.066 --> 01:44:35.499
MATT: (meowing)

01:44:37.066 --> 01:44:38.051
(short meow)

01:44:38.051 --> 01:44:39.774
(laughter)

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:43.314
MATT: Turns around with a slight begrudging, like, "Okay."

01:44:43.314 --> 01:44:45.597
That type of feel beneath the meow.

01:44:45.597 --> 01:44:49.124
But the meal is now under preparation.

01:44:49.124 --> 01:44:52.225
You can see Dagen is jetting around

01:44:52.225 --> 01:44:54.667
and inspecting the interior of the tower.

01:44:56.983 --> 01:44:58.339
"Man, you weren't joking.

01:44:58.339 --> 01:45:01.074
"You <i>are</i> some Assembly folk,

01:45:01.074 --> 01:45:03.654
"or at least capable.

01:45:03.654 --> 01:45:07.097
"Though they aren't usually much for sharing."

01:45:09.254 --> 01:45:10.964
Glides back down.

01:45:10.964 --> 01:45:12.997
TALIESIN: We're independent contractors.

01:45:13.904 --> 01:45:15.384
MATT: "Well, I don't mind staying along

01:45:15.384 --> 01:45:18.204
"with contractors that provide a better place to sleep,

01:45:18.204 --> 01:45:19.402
"I'll tell you that."

01:45:20.328 --> 01:45:21.864
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm looking forward to the meal.

01:45:21.864 --> 01:45:23.944
LIAM: Let me show you your room.
MATT: "Yeah, please."

01:45:23.944 --> 01:45:25.394
LIAM: I will start to hover up

01:45:25.394 --> 01:45:27.784
to the first of the guest floors

01:45:27.784 --> 01:45:30.064
where Caduceus and Yasha's room are,

01:45:30.064 --> 01:45:32.448
but there's a third room there.

01:45:32.448 --> 01:45:35.581
And when we go in,

01:45:35.581 --> 01:45:38.934
it is stained glass with wolves

01:45:38.934 --> 01:45:40.204
over the fireplace.

01:45:40.204 --> 01:45:42.029
And bacon strips along the bottom.

01:45:42.029 --> 01:45:42.862
(laughter)

01:45:42.862 --> 01:45:44.734
LIAM: And all the same accoutrement

01:45:44.734 --> 01:45:46.154
that are in the other rooms,

01:45:46.154 --> 01:45:49.894
and then his central room has got axes all on the wall

01:45:49.894 --> 01:45:51.274
and a massive wet bar

01:45:51.274 --> 01:45:53.954
with every whiskey and bourbon imaginable,

01:45:53.954 --> 01:45:56.709
and a couple of jugs that just have "XXX" on them.

01:45:57.574 --> 01:46:02.216
And a fairly traditional and basic bedroom.

01:46:02.216 --> 01:46:05.944
MATT: He glides in and goes, "(chuckles)

01:46:05.944 --> 01:46:07.544
"A little kitschy, but I like it.

01:46:09.032 --> 01:46:10.664
"All right, this'll do, thank you.

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:12.087
"Thank you very much."

01:46:12.087 --> 01:46:14.864
LIAM: That tub is scalding hot when you first get in,

01:46:14.864 --> 01:46:16.634
so easy does it.

01:46:16.634 --> 01:46:18.407
MATT: "Fair enough."

01:46:18.407 --> 01:46:22.467
LIAM: All right, well, let's say dinner in about 30 minutes?

01:46:23.624 --> 01:46:25.274
TALIESIN: Dry off a bit.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:46:25.274 --> 01:46:26.764
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:46:26.764 --> 01:46:28.504
MATT: Eventually, the food is prepared,

01:46:28.504 --> 01:46:32.354
a fantastic spread of cat design

01:46:32.354 --> 01:46:33.994
to the specifications you required.

01:46:33.994 --> 01:46:36.094
Meals that are familiar to you

01:46:36.094 --> 01:46:39.047
and a handful that are new to anybody,

01:46:40.174 --> 01:46:43.954
as they've been created in the request stage.

01:46:43.954 --> 01:46:47.104
But nevertheless, a fine dinner spread

01:46:47.104 --> 01:46:48.417
is enjoyed by all.

01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:53.273
Some laughter, and imbibement,

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:56.139
and eventually, the evening comes to a close.

01:46:56.139 --> 01:46:57.544
Is there anything you would like to accomplish

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:59.421
before the night comes to a close,

01:46:59.421 --> 01:47:00.254
and we'll go to the next morning?

01:47:00.254 --> 01:47:02.174
TRAVIS: Actually, I'd like to find Dagen

01:47:02.174 --> 01:47:05.194
and just say: It's fair to keep you abreast

01:47:05.194 --> 01:47:07.894
of two individuals that we are keeping an eye out for.

01:47:08.846 --> 01:47:11.134
For any reason, if you should become separated from us,

01:47:11.134 --> 01:47:13.954
we are keeping a look out for this fellow,

01:47:13.954 --> 01:47:15.817
and I'll make myself look like Molly.

01:47:16.664 --> 01:47:17.854
MATT: "Gotcha."
TRAVIS: And this,

01:47:17.854 --> 01:47:20.483
I'll make myself look like Cree.

01:47:20.483 --> 01:47:23.283
These two seems to be on the trail

01:47:23.283 --> 01:47:28.033
for the same sort of items, things that we're looking for.

01:47:29.014 --> 01:47:29.847
Be wary.

01:47:30.721 --> 01:47:32.444
MATT: "All right, I'll keep an eye out.

01:47:32.444 --> 01:47:33.654
"Appreciate the heads up." (hiccup)

01:47:33.654 --> 01:47:36.591
TRAVIS: You haven't seen them at anytime, have you?

01:47:36.591 --> 01:47:38.344
MATT: "I haven't, no."

01:47:38.344 --> 01:47:39.232
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:47:39.232 --> 01:47:41.754
SAM: (quietly) Insight check.

01:47:41.754 --> 01:47:43.884
TRAVIS: (pigeon coos) Insight check. Do I believe him?

01:47:43.884 --> 01:47:45.778
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:47:45.778 --> 01:47:47.394
TALIESIN: Roll a four.

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:48.527
TRAVIS: Natural one.

01:47:48.527 --> 01:47:49.685
TALIESIN: Even better.

01:47:51.237 --> 01:47:53.124
MATT: I mean, he's a little tipsy.

01:47:53.124 --> 01:47:56.309
Seems to be forthcoming, best you can tell.

01:47:56.309 --> 01:47:57.467
TRAVIS: Good chap.

01:47:58.422 --> 01:47:59.641
Go to morning.

01:47:59.641 --> 01:48:01.209
MATT: All right.

01:48:01.209 --> 01:48:02.344
Anybody else?

01:48:02.344 --> 01:48:03.259
We good?

01:48:03.259 --> 01:48:04.092
MARISHA: I'll--

01:48:05.042 --> 01:48:06.800
a hot bath sounds really nice,

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:09.754
so after dinner, go back to my room,

01:48:09.754 --> 01:48:13.516
run a hot bath, talk to one of the cats,

01:48:13.516 --> 01:48:15.594
request some hot cocoa.

01:48:15.594 --> 01:48:16.744
MATT: (affirmative meow)

01:48:16.744 --> 01:48:19.852
Maybe some like chocolate dipped strawberries.

01:48:20.769 --> 01:48:21.877
MATT: (begrudging mrrp)

01:48:21.877 --> 01:48:24.843
MARISHA: You know, and chardonnay.

01:48:24.843 --> 01:48:26.169
MATT: (uncertain cat noise)

01:48:26.169 --> 01:48:27.450
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:48:27.450 --> 01:48:29.264
MATT: (meows)

01:48:29.264 --> 01:48:30.374
Darts into the wall.

01:48:30.374 --> 01:48:33.042
MARISHA: As the tub is filling up,

01:48:33.042 --> 01:48:34.900
I reach in my pocket,

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:37.458
pull out the poem from Yasha.
MATT: Oh, right, right!

01:48:37.458 --> 01:48:39.565
(cheering)
TRAVIS: The what?

01:48:39.565 --> 01:48:41.048
LAURA: The poem!
MARISHA: The poem.

01:48:41.048 --> 01:48:43.123
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

01:48:44.167 --> 01:48:45.767
MARISHA: Just stare at it for a moment.

01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:49.024
LAURA: "Oh, Beau, Beau, Beau."

01:48:50.641 --> 01:48:52.416
TALIESIN: Whoa.
MARISHA: Put it down.

01:48:52.416 --> 01:48:54.774
I stare at it for a little bit longer,

01:48:54.774 --> 01:48:56.734
wait for my chardonnay to show up,

01:48:56.734 --> 01:48:58.387
chug my chardonnay.

01:48:59.534 --> 01:49:01.858
Pick it up again.

01:49:01.858 --> 01:49:03.066
Open it.

01:49:05.043 --> 01:49:06.675
And I read the poem.

01:49:08.121 --> 01:49:08.954
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:49:11.059 --> 01:49:12.192
So, um.

01:49:13.484 --> 01:49:18.185
MARISHA: My brain swirls as I hear Yasha's voiceover--

01:49:18.185 --> 01:49:19.718
(laughter)

01:49:19.718 --> 01:49:21.095
ASHLEY: (warbling)

01:49:21.095 --> 01:49:23.195
MARISHA: -- in my head.

01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:26.430
ASHLEY: So it's--

01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:31.430
At the top of it, it's a whole paragraph

01:49:31.474 --> 01:49:35.147
that is crossed out and scraped

01:49:35.147 --> 01:49:39.071
and you see some words like "Beau"

01:49:39.071 --> 01:49:40.338
and "abs"--

01:49:40.338 --> 01:49:42.637
(laughter)
ASHLEY: -- and "shorn"--

01:49:42.637 --> 01:49:44.434
(laughter)

01:49:44.434 --> 01:49:46.314
ASHLEY: -- and "envelop," and things like that,

01:49:46.314 --> 01:49:47.907
and it's just crossed out.

01:49:49.994 --> 01:49:51.557
And underneath it:

01:49:54.934 --> 01:49:56.101
"Beau,

01:49:57.392 --> 01:49:59.308
"Yeah, this was a poem,

01:49:59.308 --> 01:50:02.147
"but then I realized it was a dumb poem

01:50:02.147 --> 01:50:03.737
"and I can't write poetry.

01:50:05.244 --> 01:50:08.504
"Sometimes, I have an easier time

01:50:08.504 --> 01:50:11.437
"when I put the pen to parchment, so here it goes.

01:50:13.284 --> 01:50:14.764
"I've watched you.

01:50:14.764 --> 01:50:18.157
"I don't mean that in a creepy way.

01:50:19.254 --> 01:50:20.954
"I mean, I am a little bit of a creep,

01:50:20.954 --> 01:50:24.974
"but I know that you know this by now;

01:50:24.974 --> 01:50:28.131
"it takes me a minute to open up.

01:50:28.131 --> 01:50:33.048
"So I watch, I observe,

01:50:33.048 --> 01:50:34.244
"I take it all in

01:50:34.244 --> 01:50:36.257
"as opposed to letting it all out.

01:50:37.404 --> 01:50:39.114
"I guess the only time I let it all out

01:50:39.114 --> 01:50:39.947
"is when I fight,

01:50:39.947 --> 01:50:43.959
"which I'm not sure is the healthiest thing in the world.

01:50:43.959 --> 01:50:46.644
"But here's some things that I've noticed about you.

01:50:48.004 --> 01:50:52.218
"You're strong, you're a leader,

01:50:52.218 --> 01:50:55.624
"you're really smart, you're really funny,

01:50:55.624 --> 01:50:57.757
"you're honest even if it hurts,

01:50:59.114 --> 01:51:01.344
"but the thing that really gets me about you,

01:51:01.344 --> 01:51:03.197
"is that you love so fiercely.

01:51:04.595 --> 01:51:07.004
"And I know you feel like an asshole most days,

01:51:07.004 --> 01:51:11.664
"but I kind of like that you're an asshole.

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.647
"You stick up for the people you love,

01:51:14.664 --> 01:51:16.337
"and you make me feel stronger.

01:51:18.354 --> 01:51:22.037
"I can hold my own. I know that you know that,

01:51:23.484 --> 01:51:25.077
"but you make me feel safe.

01:51:26.804 --> 01:51:28.944
"I don't even know if that makes sense.

01:51:28.944 --> 01:51:33.197
"But I know, no matter what,

01:51:33.197 --> 01:51:35.939
"you'll have my back, no questions asked.

01:51:35.939 --> 01:51:37.247
"Yasha."

01:51:46.286 --> 01:51:47.486
MARISHA: Guh.

01:51:48.828 --> 01:51:50.254
MATT: (meows)

01:51:50.254 --> 01:51:52.271
MARISHA: Fuck off, Fluffy.

01:51:52.271 --> 01:51:54.644
MATT: (meows) Leaves the cocoa behind. (offended meow)

01:51:54.644 --> 01:51:56.061
MARISHA: Thanks, Fluffy.

01:51:58.744 --> 01:52:02.381
Wipe away a few tears, as I see them hit the paper.

01:52:02.381 --> 01:52:03.614
(sniffles)

01:52:04.664 --> 01:52:08.068
And I just sink into the tub

01:52:08.068 --> 01:52:11.994
until I'm underneath and I just stay there

01:52:11.994 --> 01:52:13.834
until I think I can't hold my breath any longer

01:52:13.834 --> 01:52:16.107
and I stay, like, 20 seconds longer.

01:52:18.817 --> 01:52:20.067
Then I come up,

01:52:21.954 --> 01:52:24.354
and I do that back and forth for a little bit,

01:52:24.354 --> 01:52:26.714
until I eventually fall asleep.

01:52:26.714 --> 01:52:27.547
TRAVIS: In the tub?

01:52:27.547 --> 01:52:29.151
MARISHA: Not in the tub, you know.

01:52:30.632 --> 01:52:33.096
Not like in a super tragic way.
MATT: The dark campaign:

01:52:33.096 --> 01:52:34.275
no monster could keep her down,

01:52:34.275 --> 01:52:36.358
but the bathtub's what finally takes her out.

01:52:36.358 --> 01:52:38.182
MARISHA: Not in like a Jim Morrison way, no.

01:52:40.334 --> 01:52:41.167
MATT: All right.

01:52:43.844 --> 01:52:45.234
LAURA: Wait, one thing.

01:52:45.234 --> 01:52:49.636
Can I float up and knock on Caleb's door?

01:52:49.636 --> 01:52:50.684
MATT: Sure.

01:52:51.609 --> 01:52:53.145
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>?

01:52:53.145 --> 01:52:56.875
LAURA: Could you cast Tongues on me?

01:52:59.174 --> 01:53:00.564
I mean, you know, the spell

01:53:00.564 --> 01:53:03.134
where you can make me understand languages or whatever?

01:53:03.134 --> 01:53:05.056
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I could do that.

01:53:05.056 --> 01:53:07.234
LAURA: I just want to read the book, Caleb.

01:53:07.234 --> 01:53:08.654
LIAM: You want to read it yourself?

01:53:08.654 --> 01:53:10.631
LAURA: Well, I mean--

01:53:10.631 --> 01:53:13.314
LIAM: I could read it to you, if you want.

01:53:14.214 --> 01:53:16.497
LAURA: Okay, it could take a while.

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:22.537
LIAM: Are we talking about "<i>Prinzenkat</i>"?

01:53:22.537 --> 01:53:24.565
LAURA: Yeah, the cute cat with the hat.

01:53:24.565 --> 01:53:25.540
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:53:27.812 --> 01:53:32.812
So I walk us in and sit us down by my fireplace,

01:53:33.744 --> 01:53:35.584
which has no stained glass window.

01:53:35.584 --> 01:53:38.764
The furniture in here is pretty nondescript.

01:53:38.764 --> 01:53:40.774
LAURA: This is a boring room, Caleb.

01:53:40.774 --> 01:53:42.990
You really decked everyone else out.

01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:44.664
LIAM: Well, that took a lot of effort for you all,

01:53:44.664 --> 01:53:46.669
so no time for me.

01:53:49.914 --> 01:53:54.050
Okay, so this is meant for children.

01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.883
LAURA: Okay.

01:53:55.764 --> 01:53:59.522
LIAM: My mother read it to me when I was very little.

01:53:59.522 --> 01:54:02.676
It's called "The Cat Prince."

01:54:02.676 --> 01:54:04.547
LAURA: "The Cat Prince."
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:54:04.547 --> 01:54:05.380
LAURA: Okay.

01:54:06.624 --> 01:54:10.246
LIAM: Okay. Once upon a time in a little house,

01:54:10.246 --> 01:54:12.714
on the edge of a great white wood, lived a young boy

01:54:12.714 --> 01:54:14.821
with his mother.

01:54:14.821 --> 01:54:17.591
The poor boy was sick, and spent much of his days in bed,

01:54:17.591 --> 01:54:19.944
watching the days pass by

01:54:19.944 --> 01:54:21.594
from a little window in his room.

01:54:22.694 --> 01:54:24.624
The boy's mother loved him very much,

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:26.864
but as it was just the two of them

01:54:26.864 --> 01:54:28.274
and the boy was ill of health,

01:54:28.274 --> 01:54:30.344
and frail of form,

01:54:30.344 --> 01:54:32.674
every day she had to make the journey to town

01:54:32.674 --> 01:54:35.224
where she worked in the kitchens of the local lord.

01:54:36.544 --> 01:54:39.674
While she was gone, the boy would mind the house,

01:54:39.674 --> 01:54:41.724
read one of their precious few books,

01:54:41.724 --> 01:54:44.554
and observe the bees and the trees--

01:54:44.554 --> 01:54:47.554
oh, that rhymes when I translate it--
LAURA: (giggles)

01:54:47.554 --> 01:54:49.194
LIAM: -- and the birds in their flight,

01:54:49.194 --> 01:54:53.072
as he spent the greater part of his time resting in bed.

01:54:53.944 --> 01:54:56.254
The boy knew that his mother loved him

01:54:56.254 --> 01:54:58.844
and that her time away was all for his sake,

01:54:58.844 --> 01:55:02.149
and he was grateful to her, and loved her in return.

01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:03.924
But it was a lonely life,

01:55:03.924 --> 01:55:06.614
spending his life rereading some of the same books

01:55:06.614 --> 01:55:08.898
or talking to the air in their little home

01:55:08.898 --> 01:55:10.040
on the wood's edge.

01:55:11.144 --> 01:55:12.544
One day--

01:55:12.544 --> 01:55:15.104
and this is all illustrated as we go through.

01:55:15.104 --> 01:55:16.584
LAURA: I hope you're showing me the pictures.

01:55:16.584 --> 01:55:18.064
LIAM: <i>Ja, ja</i>, we're going page by page.

01:55:18.064 --> 01:55:19.504
We're sitting on the couch together.

01:55:19.504 --> 01:55:22.214
As the boy say in bed, looking out at the fields

01:55:22.214 --> 01:55:24.862
that lay between his home and the woods,

01:55:24.862 --> 01:55:26.654
he noticed a cat, making its way

01:55:26.654 --> 01:55:27.767
out of the forest.

01:55:29.674 --> 01:55:31.204
Been a long time since I read this.

01:55:31.204 --> 01:55:34.484
It was not long before the boy realized this cat,

01:55:34.484 --> 01:55:36.724
clearly making its way toward his home,

01:55:36.724 --> 01:55:38.706
was no ordinary cat,

01:55:38.706 --> 01:55:41.497
for upon his head, he wore a little top hat.

01:55:42.364 --> 01:55:44.394
And if that were not strange enough on its own,

01:55:44.394 --> 01:55:48.724
as the cat pattered up beneath the boy's window,

01:55:48.724 --> 01:55:51.574
he stood, doffed his cap, took a bow,

01:55:51.574 --> 01:55:53.321
and said, "Greetings, young master.

01:55:53.321 --> 01:55:56.028
"You look as if you could use a bit of dancing."

01:55:57.434 --> 01:56:02.314
The boy, stunned by these words from the dapper little cat

01:56:02.314 --> 01:56:04.691
could scarcely find his voice.

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:06.881
"Oh, no, sir," said the boy,

01:56:06.881 --> 01:56:08.151
"I don't know how to dance,

01:56:08.151 --> 01:56:10.141
"nor am I made for it."

01:56:10.141 --> 01:56:11.501
"Nonsense," said the cat.

01:56:11.501 --> 01:56:14.191
"Why, anyone can dance, if only they look to.

01:56:14.191 --> 01:56:16.984
"Come out of doors and let me show you."

01:56:16.984 --> 01:56:19.134
And as he spoke, the cat donned his hat

01:56:19.134 --> 01:56:22.285
and began to turn in circles and dance.

01:56:23.824 --> 01:56:25.754
And he's dancing on the page.

01:56:25.754 --> 01:56:28.151
The boy was curious, but said, "Good sir cat,

01:56:28.151 --> 01:56:30.861
"I am afraid I am ill, my lungs are too weak,

01:56:30.861 --> 01:56:32.871
"and my bones are too frail."

01:56:33.741 --> 01:56:36.391
"Maybe they are, and maybe they aren't," the cat replied.

01:56:36.391 --> 01:56:39.991
"But either way, you do not want to languish one more day

01:56:39.991 --> 01:56:43.599
"in bed, watching the world go by, do you?

01:56:43.599 --> 01:56:45.807
"Come, take a walk with me through the fields,

01:56:45.807 --> 01:56:47.135
"and I will show you how to dance."

01:56:48.797 --> 01:56:51.074
Overcoming his doubts, the boy managed to climb down

01:56:51.074 --> 01:56:53.804
from his window and walk a few steps closer.

01:56:53.804 --> 01:56:57.184
This was no ordinary cat and no ordinary day.

01:56:57.184 --> 01:57:00.434
And though he felt unsure, his heart did leap a little,

01:57:00.434 --> 01:57:02.334
and he began to follow the marvelous little cat

01:57:02.334 --> 01:57:05.184
through the grass, slowly at first, but with more vigor

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:06.954
as they crossed the fields.

01:57:06.954 --> 01:57:09.914
And eventually he found himself stepping under the shade

01:57:09.914 --> 01:57:13.794
of the woods for the first time in a great many years.

01:57:13.794 --> 01:57:15.754
All the while the cat frolicked and capered

01:57:15.754 --> 01:57:17.594
as they wound their way deeper into the wood,

01:57:17.594 --> 01:57:20.384
and eventually the boy found himself stepping

01:57:20.384 --> 01:57:22.584
into a ring of trees.

01:57:22.584 --> 01:57:25.094
The cat whirling about, his hat in hand,

01:57:25.094 --> 01:57:27.684
the furry little dancer twirled around the boy laughing

01:57:27.684 --> 01:57:31.534
and calling, while the boy watched, his mouth agape.

01:57:31.534 --> 01:57:33.934
And then quick as a flash, the cat brought his top hat

01:57:33.934 --> 01:57:36.649
down right atop the boy's head, who was very suddenly

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:39.062
plunged into darkness.

01:57:39.062 --> 01:57:40.634
LAURA: Is this going to be a sad story, Caleb?

01:57:40.634 --> 01:57:42.026
LIAM: Then I turn the page.

01:57:43.024 --> 01:57:46.424
But only a moment, because all
about him shining in the dark,

01:57:46.424 --> 01:57:50.984
he saw the glow of hundreds of eyes, feline eyes

01:57:50.984 --> 01:57:52.454
glimmering in the dark.

01:57:52.454 --> 01:57:54.614
Suddenly, about him lanterns flared to life

01:57:54.614 --> 01:57:57.114
and the boy saw he was no longer in a wood at all.

01:57:57.114 --> 01:58:01.414
Here he saw a grand ballroom festively decorated

01:58:01.414 --> 01:58:04.764
and filled to the brim with cats.

01:58:04.764 --> 01:58:08.044
Big cats, small ones, old cats, young ones,

01:58:08.044 --> 01:58:10.994
cats of every breed and color, and in the center

01:58:10.994 --> 01:58:13.434
of the great hall upon the stage stood the boy's

01:58:13.434 --> 01:58:17.814
feline guide, only now he was dressed in very fine robes,

01:58:17.814 --> 01:58:20.594
and upon his head sat a thin golden crown

01:58:20.594 --> 01:58:22.454
of wrought golden leaves.

01:58:22.454 --> 01:58:24.762
LAURA: (whispered) He's a prince.
LIAM: Which is illustrated right there.

01:58:24.762 --> 01:58:26.562
Beautiful little cat.

01:58:26.562 --> 01:58:28.554
Well-worn pages.

01:58:28.554 --> 01:58:31.274
The boy stood in wonder and amazement as the great host

01:58:31.274 --> 01:58:33.804
of cats bowed to their prince, and then in turn,

01:58:33.804 --> 01:58:35.531
bowed to him.

01:58:35.531 --> 01:58:38.114
"The world of men is heavy and hard,"

01:58:38.114 --> 01:58:40.636
the princely cat proclaimed.

01:58:40.636 --> 01:58:44.074
"But here across the veil we move with lighter step.

01:58:44.074 --> 01:58:47.886
"Dance with us, child, and forget
your troubles for a spell."

01:58:47.886 --> 01:58:51.003
All at once, scores of cats closed in around the boy

01:58:51.003 --> 01:58:54.824
purring and turning about his legs as thick as the sea,

01:58:54.824 --> 01:58:58.254
and as they moved, so too did the boy's feet.

01:58:58.254 --> 01:59:00.814
He swirled amongst them like a cork on the water,

01:59:00.814 --> 01:59:03.754
and before he knew it the boy was dancing,

01:59:03.754 --> 01:59:07.704
dancing and dancing as he never imagined he could,

01:59:07.704 --> 01:59:12.594
and his breath, much to his surprise, was hearty and hale.

01:59:12.594 --> 01:59:16.719
He found he no longer felt ill in the least.

01:59:16.719 --> 01:59:20.594
Hours passed and he and all the cats danced without end,

01:59:20.594 --> 01:59:22.844
and the prince of cats more than all of them.

01:59:24.504 --> 01:59:27.784
After a long while, the boy suddenly remembered his mother

01:59:27.784 --> 01:59:30.134
and immediately feared she would worry.

01:59:30.134 --> 01:59:31.734
He stopped in the middle of the great hall

01:59:31.734 --> 01:59:33.371
and called out to the prince of cats,

01:59:33.371 --> 01:59:36.254
"Forgive me, Sir Cat, but I can longer stay.

01:59:36.254 --> 01:59:37.414
"My mother will worry.

01:59:37.414 --> 01:59:39.956
"I have to return."

01:59:39.956 --> 01:59:41.740
All the cats parted before him

01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:44.074
and the prince approached the boy.

01:59:44.074 --> 01:59:45.834
"Are you sure, boy?

01:59:45.834 --> 01:59:48.364
"You could stay and dance with us for as long as you wish,

01:59:48.364 --> 01:59:50.676
"forever and ever and ever."

01:59:52.651 --> 01:59:53.961
"I cannot," the boy replied.

01:59:53.961 --> 01:59:57.194
"My mother has only me and I would not leave her alone.

01:59:57.194 --> 01:59:59.174
"Forgive me."

01:59:59.174 --> 02:00:01.064
The prince of cats looked upon the boy

02:00:01.064 --> 02:00:04.887
with a sympathetic eye, "Not at all, young one.

02:00:05.774 --> 02:00:07.564
"Fear not a whit.

02:00:07.564 --> 02:00:10.106
"You do your mother credit."

02:00:11.947 --> 02:00:14.861
And with that, the prince of cats stepped closer.

02:00:14.861 --> 02:00:16.534
"Do not look so crestfallen.

02:00:16.534 --> 02:00:19.164
"Take our cat's grace with you.

02:00:19.164 --> 02:00:22.644
"You can always dance if the will is there."

02:00:22.644 --> 02:00:25.874
And from behind his back he brought out his top hat again

02:00:25.874 --> 02:00:27.594
and pulled it over the boy's eyes,

02:00:27.594 --> 02:00:29.764
and once again, all was dark.

02:00:33.318 --> 02:00:37.144
Sometime later, the boy stirred and his eyes fluttered open.

02:00:37.144 --> 02:00:39.224
He looked about and discovered he had been asleep

02:00:39.224 --> 02:00:42.984
in the wood and the sun now dappled
his face through the trees.

02:00:42.984 --> 02:00:45.884
Next, he noticed a threadbare, patched top hat

02:00:45.884 --> 02:00:48.654
lying in the soft grass beside him.

02:00:48.654 --> 02:00:51.594
He gingerly picked it up and stood within the same circle

02:00:51.594 --> 02:00:54.964
of trees. As he did so, he took a deep breath

02:00:54.964 --> 02:00:59.704
and smelled the earth and the forest, and as he did,

02:00:59.704 --> 02:01:03.895
he realized his breath was strong and his legs hardy.

02:01:06.241 --> 02:01:08.314
"<i>Danke</i>," he said.

02:01:08.314 --> 02:01:10.414
As he looked down at the hat in his hands.

02:01:11.254 --> 02:01:16.254
And placing it upon his head, he smiled, picked up his heels

02:01:16.384 --> 02:01:21.372
and quietly started to dance his way all the way back home.

02:01:22.823 --> 02:01:23.656
The end.

02:01:23.656 --> 02:01:25.372
LAURA: That was a happy story, Caleb!

02:01:25.372 --> 02:01:28.184
LIAM: Mm-hmm! That's why my mother read it to me.

02:01:28.184 --> 02:01:29.784
LAURA: I really thought that, like, the cat prince

02:01:29.784 --> 02:01:31.484
was going to trap him in there forever,

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:33.154
and then he wouldn't be able to go see his mother.

02:01:33.154 --> 02:01:35.784
LIAM: Well, a lot of Zemnian stories do end that way,

02:01:35.784 --> 02:01:36.992
it is true.

02:01:39.217 --> 02:01:42.027
LAURA: The Cat Prince kind of reminds me of The Traveler.

02:01:43.637 --> 02:01:45.329
LIAM: It's true, isn't it?

02:01:45.329 --> 02:01:46.162
LAURA: Yeah.

02:01:48.415 --> 02:01:49.248
Wow.

02:01:49.248 --> 02:01:50.993
LIAM: A little dicey, but very likable.

02:01:50.993 --> 02:01:55.549
LAURA: (giggles) Good in the end, you know?

02:01:55.549 --> 02:01:57.391
That was a really good story.

02:01:59.204 --> 02:02:01.476
LIAM: I'm happy that I could share it with you.

02:02:01.476 --> 02:02:03.034
LAURA: Thank you.

02:02:05.104 --> 02:02:06.315
Can I have it back?

02:02:06.315 --> 02:02:08.014
LIAM: Oh yeah, it is your copy.

02:02:08.014 --> 02:02:10.907
It will vanish when you leave here, though, but it is yours.

02:02:14.304 --> 02:02:15.560
LAURA: Thank you.

02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:18.143
(gentle music)

02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:22.963
All right, good night, Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah, goodnight.

02:02:22.963 --> 02:02:25.028
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

02:02:26.561 --> 02:02:28.662
LAURA: You wrote that whole fucking book?

02:02:30.532 --> 02:02:32.943
LIAM: Uh, some Zemnian wrote it.
LAURA: (scoffs)

02:02:32.943 --> 02:02:35.355
(laughter)

02:02:35.355 --> 02:02:38.751
LAURA: All right, good night (laughs).

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:41.164
SAM: Now you have to tell the story to Fjord,

02:02:41.164 --> 02:02:42.464
and then he has to tell it--

02:02:42.464 --> 02:02:45.056
(laughter)

02:02:45.056 --> 02:02:46.031
LIAM: When I tell it to Fjord,

02:02:46.031 --> 02:02:49.064
the prince of cats murders the boy and all the cats.

02:02:49.898 --> 02:02:52.299
MARISHA: He went to, like, some cat rave.
LAURA: Nom, nom, nom, nom.

02:02:52.299 --> 02:02:54.020
TRAVIS: Is that a real story?

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:55.939
LAURA: I know, right?

02:02:55.939 --> 02:02:59.714
LIAM: Nobody asked me to read them
a transmutation book. Nobody.

02:02:59.714 --> 02:03:01.444
TRAVIS: Is that a real story, or did you write that?

02:03:01.444 --> 02:03:05.286
LAURA: Did you really write that?
LIAM: I wrote it. Today.

02:03:05.286 --> 02:03:07.370
MARISHA: You did not write it today.
LAURA: How did you even know--

02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:08.825
LIAM: I wrote it today.

02:03:08.825 --> 02:03:12.022
She asked me to-- she wanted to read it a few days ago,

02:03:12.022 --> 02:03:13.246
so I wrote it today.

02:03:13.246 --> 02:03:14.338
LAURA: Wow.
SAM: Nice.

02:03:14.338 --> 02:03:15.668
MARISHA: That's very well done.

02:03:15.668 --> 02:03:17.558
TALIESIN: Who are you?
MATT: That's very sweet.

02:03:17.558 --> 02:03:18.474
LAURA: So impressive.

02:03:18.474 --> 02:03:19.641
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:03:21.164 --> 02:03:25.664
MATT: As the evening draws to a close, a night's rest

02:03:25.664 --> 02:03:28.484
much more comfortable than the previous.

02:03:28.484 --> 02:03:30.984
Some with dreams of

02:03:33.217 --> 02:03:36.417
unique motion and playful anxiety,

02:03:36.417 --> 02:03:39.197
others with dreams of dancing cats.

02:03:40.854 --> 02:03:42.595
Others with

02:03:44.287 --> 02:03:47.387
loose threads still left uncut.

02:03:49.614 --> 02:03:53.672
Some of vengeance found unintentionally.

02:03:53.672 --> 02:03:56.680
Some of vengeance found unintentionally.

02:03:58.124 --> 02:04:02.985
Some of vengeance still to be acquired.

02:04:05.134 --> 02:04:09.851
Some to discover the depths

02:04:09.851 --> 02:04:11.851
of the mysteries that taught

02:04:11.851 --> 02:04:13.547
those you care about.

02:04:16.504 --> 02:04:21.504
And some dreams of accepting

02:04:21.784 --> 02:04:23.954
whatever this new chapter means.

02:04:26.944 --> 02:04:31.294
Some just drink until they slept in their guest room.

02:04:31.294 --> 02:04:35.634
But with the morning, you gather your things

02:04:35.634 --> 02:04:38.625
after a hearty morning cat-prepared breakfast,

02:04:39.894 --> 02:04:42.604
prepare yourselves to see the warm interior

02:04:42.604 --> 02:04:45.584
one last time before setting out into the third day

02:04:45.584 --> 02:04:48.294
of travel northward into the snowy fields of Eiselcross.

02:04:48.294 --> 02:04:49.314
I would like somebody to go ahead

02:04:49.314 --> 02:04:51.304
and roll another d20 for me, please.

02:04:51.304 --> 02:04:52.724
LAURA: I think Ashley is up.

02:04:52.724 --> 02:04:54.457
ASHLEY: Me?
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yeah.

02:04:54.457 --> 02:04:56.375
ASHLEY: (exhales) Okay.

02:04:56.375 --> 02:04:58.064
TRAVIS: Come on, come on, come on.

02:04:58.064 --> 02:04:59.461
ASHLEY: What do I add?

02:04:59.461 --> 02:05:01.854
MATT: Just roll a d20.

02:05:01.854 --> 02:05:04.287
ASHLEY: Ooh, three.

02:05:04.287 --> 02:05:06.532
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yes!

02:05:06.532 --> 02:05:08.936
TALIESIN: That could mean anything.

02:05:08.936 --> 02:05:10.443
TRAVIS: It'll be fine.
LAURA: He marked...

02:05:11.368 --> 02:05:13.330
LIAM: You find Santa's workshop.

02:05:14.714 --> 02:05:16.814
MATT: Could you roll a d8 for me?

02:05:16.814 --> 02:05:17.856
LAURA: Oh no.

02:05:17.856 --> 02:05:19.539
SAM: A follow-up roll.
MARISHA: Shit.

02:05:19.539 --> 02:05:22.554
LAURA: Not good. This is not good.

02:05:22.554 --> 02:05:24.794
SAM: Which kind of dragon will attack?

02:05:24.794 --> 02:05:27.754
TRAVIS: No, I think it's how many.

02:05:27.754 --> 02:05:28.834
ASHLEY: Five.

02:05:28.834 --> 02:05:30.304
LAURA: Five dragons will attack.

02:05:30.304 --> 02:05:32.724
MATT: Five, okay.

02:05:32.724 --> 02:05:34.235
ASHLEY: Leave it to me.

02:05:36.357 --> 02:05:37.190
MATT: That's cocked.

02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:39.473
Okay.

02:05:42.254 --> 02:05:46.354
Hours pass as you press into a harsher day upon

02:05:46.354 --> 02:05:48.784
the snowy plains of Eiselcross.

02:05:48.784 --> 02:05:51.004
The winds have picked up a bit, the snowfall

02:05:51.004 --> 02:05:54.775
has come a bit thick, and elements of distant ice fog

02:05:54.775 --> 02:05:59.775
block the horizon from the crisp previous day's journey.

02:06:00.514 --> 02:06:05.514
You trust in Dagen's directional sense and pushing forward

02:06:05.744 --> 02:06:07.644
because at certain moments, you look around you

02:06:07.644 --> 02:06:11.644
and have no idea which way is north.

02:06:11.644 --> 02:06:14.867
You have as good a sense as anybody, and even then,

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:16.174
it takes a moment to ground yourself

02:06:16.174 --> 02:06:20.624
because this landscape at times feels

02:06:20.624 --> 02:06:23.499
alien and repetitive

02:06:23.499 --> 02:06:25.807
in a very odd way.

02:06:27.664 --> 02:06:31.977
Pressing on about early afternoon-ish,

02:06:32.944 --> 02:06:35.044
the clouds grow darker

02:06:35.044 --> 02:06:38.535
and it seems like a bit of a storm

02:06:38.535 --> 02:06:42.757
of some kind is making its way in your path.

02:06:44.224 --> 02:06:46.864
As you feel the temperatures drop and the wind

02:06:46.864 --> 02:06:50.622
grow ever stronger, you can hear the distant howling sound

02:06:50.622 --> 02:06:55.564
of cold wind beginning to blow through the mountain range

02:06:55.564 --> 02:07:00.562
that sits to your immediate west, causing this haunting

02:07:01.683 --> 02:07:06.424
multi-tiered, terrifying whistling

02:07:07.541 --> 02:07:09.691
choir of voices.

02:07:12.634 --> 02:07:17.460
Caduceus and Beauregard, as you're pushing through

02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:21.460
this steadily shaded space,

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:25.093
as you crest some hills

02:07:25.093 --> 02:07:29.384
and head into some valley portions, you swear you see

02:07:29.384 --> 02:07:32.551
something-- like something in the snow move for a moment.

02:07:33.664 --> 02:07:35.614
TALIESIN: We've got company.

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:36.714
MARISHA: Underneath the snow?

02:07:37.554 --> 02:07:38.917
Like it's growing?

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:41.584
MATT: Like the snow above the hill to your right

02:07:41.584 --> 02:07:43.644
seems to move slightly.

02:07:43.644 --> 02:07:46.134
TALIESIN: There's something underneath
the snow right over there.

02:07:46.134 --> 02:07:49.984
MARISHA: I just track it, look for any other signs.

02:07:49.984 --> 02:07:52.924
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

02:07:52.924 --> 02:07:54.090
Both of you.

02:07:58.304 --> 02:07:59.514
TALIESIN: 22.

02:07:59.514 --> 02:08:00.444
MARISHA: 20.

02:08:00.444 --> 02:08:01.277
MATT: Okay.

02:08:02.504 --> 02:08:06.147
As you all stop for a second, Dagen halts and goes,

02:08:06.147 --> 02:08:08.405
"What's that you're saying?"

02:08:08.405 --> 02:08:10.755
TALIESIN: Something beneath the snow is moving.

02:08:12.724 --> 02:08:14.334
MATT: He starts looking around the space and

02:08:14.334 --> 02:08:18.039
reaches back and just puts the hand on the handle of Sheila.

02:08:19.534 --> 02:08:21.994
You both glance over in that direction and you catch

02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:24.404
a little bit of movement on the hill to your left as well.

02:08:24.404 --> 02:08:25.844
MARISHA: Behind us, separate?

02:08:25.844 --> 02:08:27.474
MATT: Separate on the other side.

02:08:27.474 --> 02:08:29.014
TALIESIN: Both sides.

02:08:29.014 --> 02:08:30.614
MARISHA: They're flanking us.

02:08:31.637 --> 02:08:33.354
Back to back, let's circle up.

02:08:33.354 --> 02:08:37.201
TRAVIS: Yeah, I summon the sword and say the word galas-var

02:08:37.201 --> 02:08:39.174
and it glows in a 20-foot radius.

02:08:39.174 --> 02:08:41.924
MATT: Okay, and as soon as the sword appears

02:08:41.924 --> 02:08:44.224
and (whooshing sound effect) as the actual Elven

02:08:44.224 --> 02:08:47.900
words are said, the runes ignite, and the light begins

02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.694
to emanate off the blade, you hear this faint shimmering,

02:08:50.694 --> 02:08:53.564
ringing (whirring sound) emanate

02:08:53.564 --> 02:08:56.194
from the blade itself as it is invoked.

02:08:56.194 --> 02:08:58.591
And at that moment, there's a sound.

02:08:58.591 --> 02:08:59.904
(whooshing)

02:08:59.904 --> 02:09:02.614
And you glance over in the direction of where you first saw,

02:09:02.614 --> 02:09:05.944
and you see a movement, a large arcing movement,

02:09:05.944 --> 02:09:09.228
something white move, and then a shape begin to suddenly

02:09:09.228 --> 02:09:12.581
spread out over in your direction as a large net

02:09:12.581 --> 02:09:14.407
begins to descend in the direction.

02:09:14.407 --> 02:09:15.784
I need everybody to make a dexterity check.

02:09:15.784 --> 02:09:17.317
You both have advantage because

02:09:17.317 --> 02:09:18.727
TRAVIS: A net!
MATT: -- you saw them.

02:09:18.727 --> 02:09:20.976
LAURA: What?
MARISHA: Advantage, and then also--

02:09:20.976 --> 02:09:22.051
LIAM: Is it a check or a save?

02:09:22.051 --> 02:09:23.184
MATT: A saving throw.

02:09:24.774 --> 02:09:26.166
Dexterity saving throw.

02:09:27.084 --> 02:09:28.425
TRAVIS: Six.

02:09:28.425 --> 02:09:30.765
MARISHA: Natural 20.
LAURA: Seven.

02:09:30.765 --> 02:09:32.164
MATT: Seven.

02:09:32.164 --> 02:09:34.424
LIAM: One, but I'll use the Ring of Evasion to succeed.

02:09:34.424 --> 02:09:35.257
MATT: Okay.

02:09:35.257 --> 02:09:36.204
SAM: 23.

02:09:36.204 --> 02:09:37.284
ASHLEY: 19.

02:09:37.284 --> 02:09:38.504
TALIESIN: 18.

02:09:38.504 --> 02:09:39.684
MARISHA: 30 total.

02:09:39.684 --> 02:09:43.876
MATT: All right, so, as the net descends,

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:46.264
Caduceus and Beauregard, you reach out and grab

02:09:46.264 --> 02:09:48.014
whoever's nearest to you.

02:09:48.014 --> 02:09:52.094
You manage to pull Yasha aside as you dodge out of the way.

02:09:52.094 --> 02:09:56.864
Caleb, there's a sudden burst of arcane inspiration

02:09:56.864 --> 02:09:59.584
within you and your body shifts faster

02:09:59.584 --> 02:10:02.334
than it normally does, and you pull out of the way.

02:10:02.334 --> 02:10:03.274
You rolled a...?

02:10:03.274 --> 02:10:04.107
SAM: 23.

02:10:04.107 --> 02:10:08.490
MATT: 23, you go ahead and just roll out of the way.

02:10:11.456 --> 02:10:12.514
MARISHA: Question.

02:10:13.384 --> 02:10:14.781
MATT: What's your question?

02:10:14.781 --> 02:10:16.481
MARISHA: Is this considered a missile?

02:10:18.384 --> 02:10:20.074
MATT: Not in that way, no.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:10:20.074 --> 02:10:21.000
TALIESIN: Good call.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.494
MATT: Good call, though.

02:10:22.494 --> 02:10:24.794
This is a wide net.

02:10:24.794 --> 02:10:27.234
This is about 40 feet from end to end.

02:10:27.234 --> 02:10:28.244
MARISHA: Okay.

02:10:28.244 --> 02:10:31.454
MATT: However, the two of you, in trying to rush out,

02:10:31.454 --> 02:10:34.914
don't quite get far enough before it descends on you.

02:10:34.914 --> 02:10:39.824
Heavy, thick, coarse rope about that big around falls,

02:10:39.824 --> 02:10:42.044
only patches about that wide between each,

02:10:42.044 --> 02:10:44.564
and it's weighted at certain points where it feels heavy

02:10:44.564 --> 02:10:46.614
when it falls on you.

02:10:46.614 --> 02:10:51.614
As soon as it hits you hear (moaning roars).

02:10:52.008 --> 02:10:52.841
LIAM and MARISHA: Giant.

02:10:52.841 --> 02:10:57.584
MATT: And you see rising from both sides about 10 to 12 feet

02:10:57.584 --> 02:11:00.584
to the shoulder, these squat humanoid forms

02:11:00.584 --> 02:11:04.904
with thick, white, coarse hair across their bodies.

02:11:04.904 --> 02:11:08.284
Dull gray, almost blue patches of
skin beneath where their face

02:11:08.284 --> 02:11:11.464
and hands are. You can see bandoliers of leather.

02:11:11.464 --> 02:11:12.894
You've encountered creatures like this before.

02:11:12.894 --> 02:11:14.742
These are yetis.
MARISHA: Yetis!

02:11:14.742 --> 02:11:17.034
MATT: And you see them stand up, weapons at the hand,

02:11:17.034 --> 02:11:19.504
shouting (roaring) as they crest the edge,

02:11:19.504 --> 02:11:22.434
and you see one stand up larger than all the rest.

02:11:22.434 --> 02:11:27.434
One hulking behemoth of a yeti as it crests the top

02:11:27.664 --> 02:11:31.644
of the hill holding this giant, jagged-looking hook spear

02:11:31.644 --> 02:11:35.636
at the end, just goes, "(roaring yeti language)"

02:11:35.636 --> 02:11:37.978
and begins charging inward,

02:11:37.978 --> 02:11:42.434
and that's where we're going to take a break.
(groaning, applause)

02:11:42.434 --> 02:11:44.084
We'll be back here in just a moment.

02:11:44.084 --> 02:11:45.726
We'll see you guys here shortly.

02:11:45.726 --> 02:11:48.643
(laughter)
(applause)

02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:50.600
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:53.513
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role Shop.

02:11:53.513 --> 02:11:55.070
(upbeat music)

02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:55.903
The cuteness,

02:11:55.903 --> 02:11:57.640
it's (unicorn neighs) overpowering!

02:11:58.805 --> 02:12:01.670
(upbeat music)

02:12:01.670 --> 02:12:03.793
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:12:04.735 --> 02:12:06.570
(upbeat music)

02:12:06.570 --> 02:12:08.520
This is a lot of stuff you guys,

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:11.113
we have like so many cool things right now.

02:12:13.046 --> 02:12:14.250
(bell dings)

02:12:14.250 --> 02:12:16.693
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:21.600
Ooh, look at this!

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.400
Look at the details, ooh.

02:12:25.684 --> 02:12:26.517
(click)

02:12:26.517 --> 02:12:28.583
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:31.587
Don't worry there is a few more minutes in the break.

02:12:31.587 --> 02:12:33.565
You've still got time.

02:12:33.565 --> 02:12:36.148
(upbeat music)

02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:41.660
(birds chirping)

02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:46.700
I'm a fan of hot air ballon rides

02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:48.663
above the Venetian countryside.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.283
I'm a fan of Momlan, she's always got my back.

02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:57.513
I'm a fan of wine, older than Taliesin.

02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:02.083
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:07.403
I'm a fan of emotes by Arsequeef, they're neat.

02:13:08.371 --> 02:13:09.204
(static sound)

02:13:09.204 --> 02:13:11.350
I'm a fan of a wife so cool,

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:12.778
people forget I exist.

02:13:12.778 --> 02:13:15.267
(ominous echo)

02:13:15.267 --> 02:13:16.733
(crow caws)

02:13:16.733 --> 02:13:19.221
(elephant trumpets)

02:13:19.221 --> 02:13:20.804
(explosion)

02:13:20.804 --> 02:13:21.987
(mechanical noise)

02:13:21.987 --> 02:13:24.169
(maggots squirm)

02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:26.211
(child crying)

02:13:26.211 --> 02:13:28.878
(heart beating)

02:13:31.449 --> 02:13:34.740
(child crying)

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:37.740
(accordion playing)

02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:40.453
I'm a fan of

02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.298
wearing your skin as a mask.

02:13:44.298 --> 02:13:47.624
(heart beating)

02:13:47.624 --> 02:13:51.541
(classical music)

02:26:21.929 --> 02:26:23.009
MATT: And welcome back.

02:26:23.009 --> 02:26:26.269
So where we left off, you all were being ambushed

02:26:26.269 --> 02:26:29.689
by a group of yeti in the middle of the Eiselcross Plains.

02:26:29.689 --> 02:26:33.109
So I just placed the minis on here in the middle.

02:26:33.109 --> 02:26:35.899
Unfortunately, the mini I ordered for Dagen

02:26:35.899 --> 02:26:37.613
didn't arrive in time, so I--
MARISHA: Don't you apologize.

02:26:37.613 --> 02:26:40.888
MATT: -- I customized one quickly.
MARISHA: Don't you apologize!

02:26:40.888 --> 02:26:42.041
LAURA: So cool, Matt.

02:26:42.041 --> 02:26:44.709
LIAM: You amazing DIY motherfucker.

02:26:44.709 --> 02:26:46.665
MATT: You guys are in there.
LAURA: Oh jeez.

02:26:46.665 --> 02:26:50.849
Okay, wait, so the net is over us, but then is it, like,

02:26:50.849 --> 02:26:52.206
are they holding the net?

02:26:52.206 --> 02:26:53.663
SAM: It's weighted.
MATT: No, it's weighted down.

02:26:53.663 --> 02:26:57.915
There are, like, heavy stones that is woven through,

02:26:57.915 --> 02:26:59.032
keeping it on the ground there.

02:27:00.009 --> 02:27:01.979
You all can tell me where you want to be placed

02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:03.714
within five feet of the net.

02:27:05.149 --> 02:27:08.398
TALIESIN: I want to be near Caleb.

02:27:08.398 --> 02:27:10.884
TRAVIS: ♪ I like to be-- ♪
TALIESIN: ♪ Under the sea. ♪

02:27:10.884 --> 02:27:12.103
MATT: So you'll be near Caleb?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:27:12.103 --> 02:27:14.619
MARISHA: What was the direction?
MATT: Caleb, you want to be there?

02:27:14.619 --> 02:27:15.779
LIAM: Yeah, that's good where I am.

02:27:15.779 --> 02:27:16.612
That's fine.

02:27:16.612 --> 02:27:18.595
MARISHA: What were the two directions that we,

02:27:18.595 --> 02:27:20.253
that Caduceus and I?
MATT: Here and here.

02:27:20.253 --> 02:27:21.403
MARISHA: All right, then I'm good.

02:27:21.403 --> 02:27:24.289
I'll turn around and look at that direction,

02:27:24.289 --> 02:27:25.787
the direction behind me, yeah.

02:27:25.787 --> 02:27:27.528
MATT: Okay. Yasha?
LIAM: I'm going to say the run

02:27:27.528 --> 02:27:29.928
shunted him and he didn't have total control of where--

02:27:29.928 --> 02:27:31.449
MATT: Okay.

02:27:31.449 --> 02:27:35.299
ASHLEY: I will be-- yeah, a little
bit next to Nott but on the other--

02:27:35.299 --> 02:27:37.715
in between Caleb and Nott.

02:27:37.715 --> 02:27:39.723
MATT: Nott, where do you want to be?
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's good.

02:27:39.723 --> 02:27:41.689
SAM: If you want to make your game table

02:27:41.689 --> 02:27:42.529
look like what you see

02:27:42.529 --> 02:27:45.059
here with Dwarven Forge modular gaming frame,

02:27:45.059 --> 02:27:46.989
go check it out at dwarvenforge.com.

02:27:46.989 --> 02:27:51.553
But, I want to be right where I am.

MARISHA: Woo!
MATT: Okay.

02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:54.677
So about there.

02:27:54.677 --> 02:27:57.539
ASHLEY: Actually, put me on the
other side because I know Caleb

02:27:57.539 --> 02:28:01.399
and Beau pulled me back from the nets.

02:28:01.399 --> 02:28:03.384
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:28:03.384 --> 02:28:06.442
MATT: And then, that'll put us at...

02:28:06.442 --> 02:28:08.684

LIAM: Oh right.

02:28:12.509 --> 02:28:14.319
We've got to have initiative!

02:30:12.463 --> 02:30:14.001
SAM: Yeah, can I run and slide--
MATT: -- creature.

02:30:14.001 --> 02:30:15.409
SAM: -- and try to kick someone?

02:30:15.409 --> 02:30:17.009
(laughter)

02:30:17.009 --> 02:30:20.159
MATT: I'll say because there is
high snow here, and your size,

02:30:20.159 --> 02:30:22.020
you would be able to attempt to hide in the snow.

02:30:22.020 --> 02:30:23.934
SAM: Okay.

02:30:23.934 --> 02:30:25.789
MATT: But if you wish to move from your spot,

02:30:25.789 --> 02:30:27.239
it's all considered difficult terrain.

02:30:27.239 --> 02:30:30.699
SAM: Sure, I'm just going to sit and hide for a second.

02:30:30.699 --> 02:30:34.129
LAURA: Oh my god, you are so close to those dudes.

02:30:34.129 --> 02:30:39.029
SAM: Okay, I rolled-- for stealth, I rolled a--

02:30:39.029 --> 02:30:39.979
oh, wow.

02:30:41.329 --> 02:30:43.012
TRAVIS: "Oh, wow."
SAM: A 34.

02:30:43.012 --> 02:30:46.839
MATT: Okay, so you are hidden in the snow.

02:30:46.839 --> 02:30:47.749
SAM: I will whip out--

02:30:47.749 --> 02:30:51.119
MATT: Just so you know, if you hide in a space

02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:53.959
and they know where you're hiding,

02:30:53.959 --> 02:30:55.429
you're not technically hiding.

02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:56.262
SAM: Dammit!

02:30:57.119 --> 02:30:59.589
MATT: You know, if there's a table in a room

02:30:59.589 --> 02:31:00.549
and you get under the table,

02:31:00.549 --> 02:31:02.469
they still know you're under the table.

02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:05.062
(laughter)

02:31:05.062 --> 02:31:07.349
LIAM: And if you burrow?

02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:10.329
MATT: So if you want to move out of that space,

02:31:10.329 --> 02:31:12.699
that will help you if you're trying to do something

02:31:12.699 --> 02:31:14.339
from a stealthy position.

02:31:14.339 --> 02:31:17.969
But as of right now, they watched you vanish in the snow,

02:31:17.969 --> 02:31:20.037
and they think you're probably where you are.

02:31:20.037 --> 02:31:22.125
LIAM: You got to try to Bugs Bunny it.

02:31:22.125 --> 02:31:23.207
(laughter)

02:31:23.207 --> 02:31:24.669
LIAM: Without making a little ridge.

02:31:24.669 --> 02:31:26.224
MATT: That's kind of what you have to do, yeah.

02:31:26.224 --> 02:31:28.198
ASHLEY: Making eye contact as you're digging.

02:31:28.198 --> 02:31:30.181
(laughter)

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:31.297
MATT: You'll never find me!

02:31:31.297 --> 02:31:33.394
(laughter)

02:31:33.394 --> 02:31:35.444
LIAM: (high-pitched) Oh, where am I?

02:31:37.029 --> 02:31:40.319
SAM: So if I attack on this turn,

02:31:40.319 --> 02:31:43.259
it would not be a sneak attack?

02:31:43.259 --> 02:31:45.229
MATT: Well, you've stealthed, and you didn't spend

02:31:45.229 --> 02:31:47.409
any movement to try and stealth.

02:31:47.409 --> 02:31:50.559
You can move with difficult terrain and remain stealthy

02:31:50.559 --> 02:31:52.675
in the snow, if you like.
SAM: Okay, okay,

02:31:52.675 --> 02:31:55.025
I'll move in the snow to try to get--

02:31:55.025 --> 02:31:55.967
MATT: Which direction?

02:31:57.159 --> 02:31:58.512
SAM: Towards the big yeti.

02:31:59.739 --> 02:32:02.539
LIAM: That was some Vax shit, because quite a few times

02:32:02.539 --> 02:32:05.047
in campaign one, it was like, I hide right in front of them.

02:32:05.047 --> 02:32:06.880
TALIESIN: I didn't prepare that spell. Oh fuck.

02:32:09.279 --> 02:32:12.629
SAM: So you're saying if I pop up now, maybe they'll--

02:32:12.629 --> 02:32:14.171
(laughing) they won't know where I am?

02:32:14.171 --> 02:32:15.399
MATT: It's possible!

02:32:15.399 --> 02:32:16.599
SAM: Okay.

02:32:16.599 --> 02:32:18.106
I'll try to do it.

02:32:18.106 --> 02:32:19.406
MATT: Okay.

02:32:19.406 --> 02:32:21.664
SAM: I'm going to just pop my arm out

02:32:21.664 --> 02:32:23.997
and, uh-- wait a sec...

02:32:23.997 --> 02:32:25.985
(laughter)

02:32:25.985 --> 02:32:28.716
LIAM: Shooting blind? Are you shooting blind?

02:32:28.716 --> 02:32:29.796
SAM: And one eye.

02:32:29.796 --> 02:32:32.329
(laughter)

02:32:32.329 --> 02:32:35.368
SAM: Um... and...

02:32:35.368 --> 02:32:37.259
MARISHA: You moved, like, 10 feet.

02:32:38.493 --> 02:32:40.390
Surprise, motherfuckers!

02:32:40.390 --> 02:32:42.769
SAM: And I'm going to Vax this shit.

02:32:42.769 --> 02:32:44.918
I'm going to throw a dagger.

02:32:44.918 --> 02:32:46.097
LAURA: What?
MATT: Oh, okay.

02:32:46.097 --> 02:32:47.989
SAM: Throwing the Corecut Dagger.

02:32:47.989 --> 02:32:49.819
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: You got it, okay.

02:32:49.819 --> 02:32:51.852
SAM: Dagger! Dagger, dagger!

02:32:51.852 --> 02:32:53.369
MATT: Did you attune to the dagger?

02:32:53.369 --> 02:32:54.269
SAM: Yes, I did!

02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:55.604
MATT: You did attune to the dagger?
SAM: I did.

02:32:55.604 --> 02:32:57.922
MATT: Okay.
SAM: And sharpshooter.

02:32:57.922 --> 02:32:59.379
LAURA: Ooh!

02:32:59.379 --> 02:33:01.549
LIAM: Putting some sting on it.

02:33:01.549 --> 02:33:03.209
SAM: All or nothing.

02:33:03.209 --> 02:33:08.209
MATT: As a quick head's up, just so you know-- where is it?

02:33:10.341 --> 02:33:12.719
ASHLEY: ♪ Duh duh duh, duh duh. ♪

02:33:12.719 --> 02:33:14.219
MATT: Oh, I need to find it again.

02:33:18.499 --> 02:33:19.959
There it is, okay.

02:33:19.959 --> 02:33:24.639
So you would have realized at the time, maybe,

02:33:24.639 --> 02:33:26.719
but we'll say now because I just realized you attuned,

02:33:26.719 --> 02:33:28.019
it is a cursed dagger.

02:33:28.019 --> 02:33:31.101
SAM: Uh huh. Sure, sure.

02:33:31.101 --> 02:33:32.196
MATT: So yeah. Just--

02:33:32.196 --> 02:33:34.855
all you know is the blade, it's bound to you

02:33:35.691 --> 02:33:38.729
and you really want to keep it bound to you for now.

02:33:38.729 --> 02:33:40.009
SAM: Does that mean I can't throw it?

02:33:40.009 --> 02:33:41.230
MATT: You can throw it.
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:43.379
I'm throwing it.
MATT: But you've got to retrieve it afterward.

02:33:43.379 --> 02:33:44.929
SAM: Of course, it's fucking cool.

02:33:44.929 --> 02:33:47.469
TRAVIS: Oh, you've got to retrieve it afterward.

02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:49.509
MARISHA: Needle in a haystack.

02:33:49.509 --> 02:33:50.749
MATT: Yeah, but it's fine.

02:33:50.749 --> 02:33:52.909
The curse doesn't mean you can't let it go.

02:33:52.909 --> 02:33:56.326
So nevertheless, you Bugs Bunny your way through the snow,

02:33:56.326 --> 02:33:59.279
(grinding sound) and chuck this dagger.

02:33:59.279 --> 02:34:00.329
Go ahead and roll for an attack.

02:34:00.329 --> 02:34:02.813
So a ranged attack.
SAM: Work, goddammit, work!

02:34:03.919 --> 02:34:07.939
Yes, 26 minus five.

02:34:07.939 --> 02:34:09.965
MATT: Correct, so 21.
SAM: So 21.

02:34:09.965 --> 02:34:10.798
MATT: That does hit.

02:34:10.798 --> 02:34:11.913
SAM: Yes!
LAURA: Yeah!

02:34:11.913 --> 02:34:13.139
MATT: Hits the big one, correct?

02:34:13.139 --> 02:34:13.999
SAM: Uh, yeah.

02:34:13.999 --> 02:34:15.469
And so is this sneak attack damage?

02:34:15.469 --> 02:34:16.399
MATT: It would be.

02:34:16.399 --> 02:34:18.199
(cheering)

02:34:19.209 --> 02:34:24.209
MATT: The snow works in your favor, being a halfling rogue.

02:34:24.379 --> 02:34:28.279
SAM: Okay, this is straight up Vax roll here.

02:34:28.279 --> 02:34:29.969
Oh, these are all terrible!

02:34:29.969 --> 02:34:30.802
It's fine.

02:34:32.292 --> 02:34:37.067
12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

02:34:39.167 --> 02:34:42.717
plus six is 28, plus 10 is 38,

02:34:42.717 --> 02:34:45.779
plus three more d6.
LIAM: That's necromancy.

02:34:45.779 --> 02:34:47.689
SAM: Oh, these are all terrible!

02:34:47.689 --> 02:34:48.829
42.

02:34:48.829 --> 02:34:51.081
MATT: 42 points damage to it.

02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:53.159
And you used the effect?

02:34:53.159 --> 02:34:55.509
SAM: I did, so some of that is necrotic.

02:34:55.509 --> 02:34:57.319
MATT: Right, but mark off a hit dice first.

02:34:57.319 --> 02:34:59.871
SAM: Yes, yes.
MATT: All right, got it.

02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:03.854
So right as they're shouting out to run.

02:35:03.854 --> 02:35:08.796
Veth just (whooshing noises, grunt)

02:35:08.796 --> 02:35:10.899
and as the dagger is inside, it's still stuck in its chest.

02:35:10.899 --> 02:35:13.319
It's just there in its sternum.

02:35:13.319 --> 02:35:15.349
It looks angrily in your direction,

02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:18.097
and its eyes flash angry blue.

02:35:18.097 --> 02:35:19.882
SAM: I go back under the snow.

02:35:19.882 --> 02:35:22.182
MATT: Okay, all right. That finishes Veth's turn.

02:35:22.182 --> 02:35:24.132
Yasha, you're up.

02:35:24.132 --> 02:35:25.908
ASHLEY: Okay, I can't get to it.

02:35:25.908 --> 02:35:27.279
I would like to rage!

02:35:27.279 --> 02:35:28.446
SAM: Yeah!
MARISHA: Rage.

02:35:28.446 --> 02:35:32.017
ASHLEY: (roaring)
TRAVIS: (snarling gibberish)

02:35:34.024 --> 02:35:37.349
TRAVIS: I almost choked on my coffee.
LAURA: (laughs, coughs)

02:35:38.255 --> 02:35:41.721
SAM: Is there a place to track hit dice? Where is this?

02:35:41.721 --> 02:35:43.237
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: I've never used hit dice.

02:35:43.237 --> 02:35:44.809
LAURA: It's in the--

02:35:44.809 --> 02:35:47.111
LIAM: You could just know it, too.

02:35:47.111 --> 02:35:48.719
SAM: I'll just mark one off somewhere.

02:35:50.688 --> 02:35:52.592
ASHLEY: I will...

02:35:56.199 --> 02:35:57.849
LAURA: In your short rest?

02:35:57.849 --> 02:35:59.424
SAM: Oh, there it is, thank you.

02:35:59.424 --> 02:36:00.507
I knew it.

02:36:02.439 --> 02:36:04.047
ASHLEY: I'm going to start--

02:36:04.047 --> 02:36:07.213
I'm going to actually try to lift up

02:36:07.213 --> 02:36:09.766
the rope to try to get them out.

02:36:09.766 --> 02:36:11.082
MATT: Okay.

02:36:11.082 --> 02:36:13.729
So you move up. Go ahead and make a strength check.

02:36:13.729 --> 02:36:16.197
Because you are raging, you do have advantage on that.

02:36:16.197 --> 02:36:17.030
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:36:18.644 --> 02:36:20.277
(groans)

02:36:20.277 --> 02:36:21.979
That's better.

02:36:21.979 --> 02:36:23.442
That would be 22.

02:36:24.276 --> 02:36:26.382
MATT: 22, okay.

02:36:26.382 --> 02:36:29.459
That will lift up the rope enough to get Jester free

02:36:29.459 --> 02:36:30.869
on this side.

02:36:30.869 --> 02:36:31.859
LAURA: Thanks, Yasha!

02:36:31.859 --> 02:36:34.719
MATT: And any other attempts to get free from the rope

02:36:34.719 --> 02:36:36.319
if they spend their action on their turn,

02:36:36.319 --> 02:36:37.659
will have advantage as well.

02:36:37.659 --> 02:36:40.175
ASHLEY: Great.
MATT: But Jester is currently now

02:36:40.175 --> 02:36:42.925
free of the net.

02:36:42.925 --> 02:36:44.389
LAURA: Woohoo!

02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:45.989
MATT: So that's your action.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:36:45.989 --> 02:36:47.976
LAURA: Did you hear that?
TRAVIS: What?

02:36:47.976 --> 02:36:49.418
LAURA: I got free of the net.

02:36:49.418 --> 02:36:50.881
TRAVIS: Okay. How'd you do it?

02:36:50.881 --> 02:36:52.200
LAURA: Yasha.

02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:54.349
ASHLEY: Just tried to help you guys out. That's my turn.

02:36:54.349 --> 02:36:55.572
MATT: That's your turn, staying there put?

02:36:55.572 --> 02:37:00.505
All right. It is now the big yeti's turn.

02:37:01.829 --> 02:37:03.796
The yeti goes-- after taking the blow from the dagger,

02:37:03.796 --> 02:37:08.045
he was like (roars), "Sneaky one".

02:37:08.045 --> 02:37:10.279
SAM: Oh shit.

02:37:10.279 --> 02:37:14.412
MATT: And he's going to go ahead and leap.

02:37:14.412 --> 02:37:16.229
SAM: I'm snow!

02:37:16.229 --> 02:37:19.271
MATT: (explosion sound)
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:37:19.271 --> 02:37:21.197
SAM: I'm just the snow!

02:37:22.999 --> 02:37:25.239
MATT: As it lands on the ground next to you,

02:37:25.239 --> 02:37:30.239
eyes now glowing with light blue rage, (roars)

02:37:30.649 --> 02:37:33.259
and starts swinging its giant, hooked spear

02:37:33.259 --> 02:37:34.694
out in front of it.

02:37:35.909 --> 02:37:39.559
These are going to be attack against both Beauregard

02:37:39.559 --> 02:37:42.369
and Veth who are both in that sweeping range there.

02:37:42.369 --> 02:37:43.409
MARISHA: All right.

02:37:43.409 --> 02:37:48.402
MATT: So that is 19 to hit against you, Veth.

02:37:48.402 --> 02:37:49.638
SAM: Yes.
MARISHA: Miss.

02:37:49.638 --> 02:37:51.121
MATT: And then Beauregard.

02:37:51.121 --> 02:37:52.754
That is a 20 to hit.

02:37:52.754 --> 02:37:53.587
MARISHA: Miss?
MATT: Misses.

02:37:53.587 --> 02:37:57.082
So Beauregard swings out of the way.

02:37:57.082 --> 02:37:58.319
TRAVIS: Is that a 15-foot reach?

02:37:58.319 --> 02:37:59.599
10-foot reach?

02:37:59.599 --> 02:38:01.366
MATT: It's a 10-foot reach, but they're both within--

02:38:01.366 --> 02:38:02.940
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: -- that space there.

02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:03.773
TRAVIS: Big boy.

02:38:03.773 --> 02:38:08.097
MATT: Veth, you take 15 points of slashing damage.

02:38:08.097 --> 02:38:09.689
TRAVIS: Who's a big boy?!
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:38:10.784 --> 02:38:14.369
MATT: And then he's going to go and swing again in an arc.

02:38:14.369 --> 02:38:17.635
That is going to be 22 against you.

02:38:17.635 --> 02:38:18.985
SAM: Yeah.

02:38:18.985 --> 02:38:20.619
MATT: And 26 against you.

02:38:20.619 --> 02:38:21.452
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:38:22.881 --> 02:38:25.359
LAURA: He looks like--
TRAVIS: Those are big hits.

02:38:25.359 --> 02:38:28.179
LAURA: -- he's landing, but also like he could be pooping.

02:38:28.179 --> 02:38:30.119
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage.

02:38:30.119 --> 02:38:30.952
MARISHA: 17?

02:38:30.952 --> 02:38:32.359
MATT: Yep. (whooshing sounds)

02:38:32.359 --> 02:38:36.329
SAM: I'm assuming because I am in snow

02:38:36.329 --> 02:38:39.445
that I can't Uncanny Dodge this.

02:38:41.809 --> 02:38:43.559
MATT: No, as a reaction you could.

02:38:43.559 --> 02:38:44.700
For one of them, yeah.

02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:46.111
SAM: Okay, I'll do that for that one.

02:38:46.111 --> 02:38:47.398
MATT: Okay.

02:38:47.398 --> 02:38:49.740
SAM: So that was 17, so it becomes eight?

02:38:51.029 --> 02:38:53.660
MATT: I forgot the order of this, but that's fine.

02:38:54.959 --> 02:38:56.592
I will then...

02:38:58.776 --> 02:39:01.134
yeah, I will then use his Chilling
Gaze, which I should have done

02:39:01.134 --> 02:39:03.214
beforehand, but that's fine.

02:39:03.214 --> 02:39:04.869
Or you know what?

02:39:04.869 --> 02:39:07.070
SAM: You can go back. You're the DM.

02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:08.278
MATT: I let you guys do it all the time.

02:39:08.278 --> 02:39:09.453
I'll go back on this one.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39:09.453 --> 02:39:10.869
SAM: Of course. You're the DM.

02:39:11.877 --> 02:39:16.555
MATT: The predecessor to this attack, angrily,

02:39:16.555 --> 02:39:18.280
because you're the source of its anger,

02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:19.613
it's going to go ahead and look at you.

02:39:19.613 --> 02:39:21.329
I need you to make a constitution saving throw, Veth.

02:39:21.329 --> 02:39:22.162
SAM: Don't worry.

02:39:22.162 --> 02:39:24.459
MATT: As suddenly you feel its piercing angry blue eyes

02:39:24.459 --> 02:39:27.314
just pierce the inside of your psyche.

02:39:29.439 --> 02:39:30.272
SAM: 20.

02:39:30.272 --> 02:39:32.399
MATT: 20. And you shrug it off.

02:39:32.399 --> 02:39:34.257
SAM: What was it?

02:39:34.257 --> 02:39:35.729
LAURA: You don't know.
SAM: Was it fright?

02:39:35.729 --> 02:39:37.137
MATT: You shrug it off.

02:39:38.509 --> 02:39:41.911
All right, that finishes its turn.

02:39:41.911 --> 02:39:44.759
And then it's going to come to
Beauregard. Fjord, you're on deck.

02:39:44.759 --> 02:39:47.875
MARISHA: Okay, so we still took
that damage, the sweep damage?

02:39:47.875 --> 02:39:49.177
MATT: You did.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:39:50.919 --> 02:39:51.949
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

02:39:51.949 --> 02:39:55.299
Well, it's right beside me, so that's convenient.

02:39:55.299 --> 02:39:57.259
Can I flank Veth?

02:39:57.259 --> 02:39:59.329
Can I move around and flank?

02:39:59.329 --> 02:40:02.504
I don't know if that's helpful but--
SAM: You could if you could see me. Ha ha ha!

02:40:03.979 --> 02:40:07.450
MARISHA: I'm going to go over here (laughs).

02:40:07.450 --> 02:40:09.845
I'm making eye contact with you.
TRAVIS: I'm fucking going over here.

02:40:09.845 --> 02:40:12.062
SAM: I'm snow!
TALIESIN: You are red snow.

02:40:12.062 --> 02:40:14.005
You are red snow.

02:40:14.005 --> 02:40:18.088
(laughter)

02:40:19.853 --> 02:40:20.690
MATT: Okay.

02:40:22.723 --> 02:40:23.773
MARISHA: Okay.

02:40:25.649 --> 02:40:29.889
I'm going to try and leap off of an icy snow bank

02:40:29.889 --> 02:40:32.509
and pop it in the head a couple of times.

02:40:32.509 --> 02:40:33.689
Pop pop!

02:40:33.689 --> 02:40:35.022
TRAVIS: Pop pop!

02:40:36.329 --> 02:40:38.249
MARISHA: 25 for that first one.

02:40:38.249 --> 02:40:40.489
MATT: 25 hits.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

02:40:40.489 --> 02:40:41.856
MATT: Stunning Strike.

02:40:44.739 --> 02:40:46.782
That is 18.

02:40:48.699 --> 02:40:51.398
MARISHA: Why? Okay, yeah.

02:40:51.398 --> 02:40:53.071
MATT: So damage on that one?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:40:53.071 --> 02:40:56.246
Uh, right, right, right, right.

02:40:58.789 --> 02:41:00.789
13, that was a terrible roll.

02:41:00.789 --> 02:41:01.697
MATT: All right.

02:41:03.459 --> 02:41:04.859
MARISHA: Okay, next one.

02:41:04.859 --> 02:41:06.209
MATT: Go for it.

02:41:06.209 --> 02:41:09.209
MARISHA: That's even better, 28.

02:41:09.209 --> 02:41:10.192
MATT: That hits.

02:41:11.373 --> 02:41:12.206
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

02:41:12.206 --> 02:41:14.199
MATT: Roll damage first, and then we'll Stunning Strike.

02:41:14.199 --> 02:41:15.109
MARISHA: Okay.

02:41:15.109 --> 02:41:16.584
MATT: I know you're excited.

02:41:19.029 --> 02:41:20.971
MARISHA: 13.

02:41:20.971 --> 02:41:22.571
No, sorry, 16, 16.

02:41:22.571 --> 02:41:24.006
MATT: 16. All righty.

02:41:24.006 --> 02:41:25.222
TRAVIS: I can't [inaudible].

02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:27.912
MATT: That is--
MARISHA: Damage, yeah.

02:41:28.959 --> 02:41:30.579
MATT: 17.

02:41:30.579 --> 02:41:31.429
MARISHA: To save from it?

02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:33.931
MATT: To save. What's the DC?

02:41:33.931 --> 02:41:36.114
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. It's 16. 16.

02:41:36.114 --> 02:41:37.700
MATT: Makes the save.

02:41:37.700 --> 02:41:40.889
MATT: How smart is this-- Okay, all right, all right.

02:41:40.889 --> 02:41:43.227
That's fine. It's constitution.

02:41:43.227 --> 02:41:47.566
MATT: Yeah. If you wanted to gauge its intelligence,

02:41:47.566 --> 02:41:49.590
you'd have to take a little moment to inspect it.

02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:50.598
MARISHA: No.

02:41:50.598 --> 02:41:53.270
SAM: Give it a quick ACT test.

02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:55.959
MATT: It's got a hefty physicality to it.

02:41:55.959 --> 02:41:57.662
MARISHA: Going for the state level.

02:41:59.039 --> 02:42:00.605
Okay.

02:42:02.114 --> 02:42:03.579
Flurry of Blows, pop pop.

02:42:03.579 --> 02:42:04.755
MATT: Go for it.

02:42:07.313 --> 02:42:11.713
MARISHA: Okay, that first one's going to be 27.

02:42:11.713 --> 02:42:12.603
MATT: That hits.

02:42:13.781 --> 02:42:14.621
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:42:16.096 --> 02:42:17.859
Stunning Strike.

02:42:17.859 --> 02:42:19.099
MATT: So damage.

02:42:19.099 --> 02:42:19.932
MARISHA: Okay.

02:42:21.369 --> 02:42:22.682
Doing it all at once.

02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:27.379
1d8 plus six is 11 damage.

02:42:27.379 --> 02:42:28.212
MATT: All right.

02:42:29.699 --> 02:42:32.143
That is 15.

02:42:32.143 --> 02:42:36.001
MARISHA: Ah ha ha! Ha ha!

02:42:36.001 --> 02:42:37.321
He is stunned!

02:42:37.321 --> 02:42:39.459
(laughter)

02:42:39.459 --> 02:42:40.834
Fuck you!

02:42:42.649 --> 02:42:44.659
Three ki points down.

02:42:44.659 --> 02:42:45.917
No, wait.

02:42:45.917 --> 02:42:48.480
Stunning Strike, Stunning Strike, and my pop pop.

02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:51.580
Four Stunning Strike-- I'm sorry, ki points.

02:42:52.719 --> 02:42:55.339
But he is done! He is stunned, okay.

02:42:55.339 --> 02:42:58.705
And last pop pop.

02:42:58.705 --> 02:43:03.305
17? Nope, sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:43:03.305 --> 02:43:04.148
21.

02:43:04.148 --> 02:43:06.246
MATT: 21 hits, roll damage.

02:43:06.246 --> 02:43:07.779
Want to Stunning Strike him again?

02:43:07.779 --> 02:43:09.089
MARISHA: No.

02:43:09.089 --> 02:43:13.209
I rolled a one, which sucks, so seven damage.

02:43:13.209 --> 02:43:14.419
MATT: Seven damage, you got it.

02:43:14.419 --> 02:43:18.049
So as you swish behind, begin pummeling the back

02:43:18.049 --> 02:43:20.459
of its leg, you find the base of its spine

02:43:20.459 --> 02:43:22.559
where you imagine where it would be, and just start

02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:24.409
hitting towards the nerve center.

02:43:24.409 --> 02:43:28.219
And it's just hitting hard muscular meat,

02:43:28.219 --> 02:43:30.049
guarded by this thick layer of fur.

02:43:30.049 --> 02:43:32.330
And you're hitting it and you're hurting it,

02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:34.979
and it's looking over, trying to swat back at you.

02:43:34.979 --> 02:43:37.229
And then you get one good hit that you assume

02:43:37.229 --> 02:43:39.379
is right in the base of its spine, and as you do it,

02:43:39.379 --> 02:43:43.259
yells and, like, locks up, and you see it start to, like,

02:43:43.259 --> 02:43:44.919
fold to one knee almost.

02:43:44.919 --> 02:43:46.344
MARISHA: Right in that sciatic nerve.

02:43:46.344 --> 02:43:48.934
MATT: Yeah, which sucks. I know from experience.

02:43:48.934 --> 02:43:51.689
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Extract Aspects.

02:43:51.689 --> 02:43:52.522
MATT: All right.

02:43:52.522 --> 02:43:56.149
You sense it is immune to cold damage,

02:43:56.149 --> 02:43:58.569
and that is the extent of its elements.

02:43:58.569 --> 02:43:59.402
LAURA: Not surprising.

02:43:59.402 --> 02:44:02.179
MARISHA: Yeah, there's nothing.
I feel like we all knew that.

02:44:02.179 --> 02:44:04.119
MATT: Well, now you know.

02:44:04.119 --> 02:44:05.518
MARISHA: It's immune to cold.

02:44:05.518 --> 02:44:06.549
SAM: Is it smart?

02:44:06.549 --> 02:44:09.248
MARISHA: No!
ASHLEY: Good to know!

02:44:09.248 --> 02:44:11.529
MARISHA: I think its constitution is beefy, though.

02:44:11.529 --> 02:44:13.804
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had plans--
TRAVIS: Beefy!

02:44:13.804 --> 02:44:17.587
MARISHA: But four ki points in, he is stunned.

02:44:19.305 --> 02:44:20.259
TRAVIS: Nice.
MATT: All right.

02:44:20.259 --> 02:44:23.072
As it's howling in pain, it is now Fjord's go.

02:44:24.418 --> 02:44:27.759
TRAVIS: Can you count the squares for me to the big yeti?

02:44:27.759 --> 02:44:30.709
Am I within 30 feet of him, or just outside of it

02:44:30.709 --> 02:44:31.869
where I am outside of it where I am under the net?

02:44:31.869 --> 02:44:33.060
I can't quite see.
MATT: Under the net,

02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:36.164
you are roughly 25 to 20 feet from him.

02:44:37.219 --> 02:44:42.219
TRAVIS: Okay, I will take, well, I'll take two--

02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:44.294
because if I try to shoot out from under this net,

02:44:44.294 --> 02:44:46.367
it would probably be a disadvantage, right?

02:44:49.375 --> 02:44:52.379
MATT: Probably. I'll say yes, just because it's

02:44:52.379 --> 02:44:54.379
instilling that challenge from below.

02:44:54.379 --> 02:44:56.709
TRAVIS: I will try and I'll take two swipes at the net

02:44:56.709 --> 02:45:00.819
to try and clear the net from Dag and myself.

02:45:00.819 --> 02:45:02.769
TALIESIN: I was just going to say you can, yeah, go ahead.

02:45:02.769 --> 02:45:03.969
MATT: Yeah, Yasha does give you an advantage

02:45:03.969 --> 02:45:05.909
if you just want to make an athletics check as your--

02:45:05.909 --> 02:45:07.627
TRAVIS: Oh!
LAURA: Oh, because she's holding it up.

02:45:07.627 --> 02:45:09.429
MATT: She's helping hold the thing up, if you want to.

02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:10.262
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:45:10.262 --> 02:45:11.489
MATT: So as opposed to having to cut through,

02:45:11.489 --> 02:45:12.709
you just actually muscle it off.

02:45:12.709 --> 02:45:13.542
TRAVIS: With advantage?

02:45:13.542 --> 02:45:14.679
MATT: With advantage on an athletics check.

02:45:14.679 --> 02:45:15.957
TRAVIS: That'd be great, okay.

02:45:16.916 --> 02:45:19.919
15 and 18.

02:45:19.919 --> 02:45:21.087
MATT: Yeah, no worries.

02:45:21.969 --> 02:45:24.405
You get the net free, it falls down into the snow.

02:45:24.405 --> 02:45:25.682
(whooshing)

02:45:25.682 --> 02:45:30.165
TRAVIS: Amazing. With my bonus action,

02:45:30.165 --> 02:45:33.715
I'd like to Channel Divinity,

02:45:33.715 --> 02:45:37.589
and I'm going to activate my Fury of the Tides.

02:45:37.589 --> 02:45:39.439
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: What the fuck?

02:45:39.439 --> 02:45:42.599
MATT: As you lift and shove the net off with your hand,

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:44.816
you hold the blade there, and as you

02:45:44.816 --> 02:45:47.376
hold it in front of you, looking around the space,

02:45:47.376 --> 02:45:49.099
you watch as some of the ice on the ground

02:45:49.099 --> 02:45:52.469
begins to suddenly melt in the proximity of the snow.

02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:55.919
As it melts, the water seems to reverse-drip

02:45:55.919 --> 02:45:57.779
upward onto the blade, and the blade itself

02:45:57.779 --> 02:46:02.579
seems to have this weird, liquid,
shimmering water across its surface.

02:46:02.579 --> 02:46:04.919
TRAVIS: Riptide, motherfuckers.

02:46:04.919 --> 02:46:05.759
MATT: All righty.

02:46:05.759 --> 02:46:07.029
You still have your movement because you broke free

02:46:07.029 --> 02:46:09.140
of the net, so you can move.
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:12.299
I will-- I have a pointer here.

02:46:12.299 --> 02:46:17.299
I will head 30 feet in this direction out this way.

02:46:18.189 --> 02:46:19.251
MATT: All righty.

02:46:19.251 --> 02:46:20.449
TALIESIN: Good call.

02:46:21.464 --> 02:46:22.969
TRAVIS: Great.

02:46:22.969 --> 02:46:24.826
MATT: You got it. That finishes Fjord's go.

02:46:24.826 --> 02:46:27.249
All right, Jester, you're up.

02:46:27.249 --> 02:46:28.911
LAURA: Can I get to the big yeti?

02:46:28.911 --> 02:46:29.977
MATT: You can.

02:46:29.977 --> 02:46:33.031
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to step up behind the big yeti.

02:46:33.031 --> 02:46:35.030
LIAM: The bagetti.
LAURA: The bagetti.

02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:36.499
TRAVIS: Spaghetti.

02:46:36.499 --> 02:46:37.774
LAURA: And I'm going to cast--

02:46:37.774 --> 02:46:39.689
MARISHA: ♪ Mom's big yeti ♪

02:46:39.689 --> 02:46:42.129
LAURA: Inflict Wounds at 5th-level.
ASHLEY: Knees weak!

02:46:42.129 --> 02:46:43.259
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:46:43.259 --> 02:46:44.749
LAURA: Do I get advantage because he's stunned?

02:46:44.749 --> 02:46:45.849
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:46:47.735 --> 02:46:49.829
LIAM: Mom's big yeti.

02:46:49.829 --> 02:46:52.977
LAURA: (excited noises)

02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:58.028
I rolled an 18.

02:46:59.709 --> 02:47:01.509
A melee spell attack.

02:47:01.509 --> 02:47:02.342
Hold on.

02:47:02.342 --> 02:47:03.484
LIAM: Snow like white confetti!

02:47:03.484 --> 02:47:06.809
LAURA: So that adds plus 10,

02:47:06.809 --> 02:47:08.069
so 28.
MARISHA: Claws sweaty!

02:47:08.069 --> 02:47:10.049
MATT: 28? All right, that'll definitely hit.

02:47:10.049 --> 02:47:12.059
Go ahead and roll damage.

02:47:12.059 --> 02:47:13.568
LAURA: 7d10.

02:47:13.568 --> 02:47:15.532
SAM: Ooh!
TALIESIN: Ow.

02:47:15.532 --> 02:47:17.682
LIAM: 70 10s?!
TRAVIS: 7d10?!

02:47:17.682 --> 02:47:18.873
LAURA: Yeah!

02:47:18.873 --> 02:47:21.227
TALIESIN: Are any of these guys holding weapons?

02:47:21.227 --> 02:47:23.556
MATT: The big one is holding this polearm

02:47:23.556 --> 02:47:24.881
with a hooked spear on the end of it.

02:47:24.881 --> 02:47:27.037
And the other ones appear to just have claws

02:47:27.037 --> 02:47:29.040
and, like, some tools and bandoliers around them.

02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:30.773
TALIESIN: So they're physical claws,

02:47:30.773 --> 02:47:33.599
they're not, like, weapon claws?

02:47:33.599 --> 02:47:35.659
MATT: No, they're just, they're physical claws.

02:47:35.659 --> 02:47:36.784
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

02:47:36.784 --> 02:47:39.549
MATT: You've not seen yetis with tools and attire before.

02:47:39.549 --> 02:47:40.974
Most of the ones you've encountered,

02:47:40.974 --> 02:47:43.281
and the one time you encountered them were a little more

02:47:43.281 --> 02:47:44.361
just feral.

02:47:44.361 --> 02:47:45.252
TRAVIS: What is it?

02:47:45.252 --> 02:47:48.277
LAURA: 41 points of damage!

02:47:48.277 --> 02:47:51.849
TRAVIS: Whoa!
TALIESIN: Whoa! Beast.

02:47:51.849 --> 02:47:55.149
MATT: As it's tensed up after being jabbed with a dagger,

02:47:55.149 --> 02:47:57.789
pummeled, and then having its spine cracked,

02:47:57.789 --> 02:48:00.549
you rush forward and as you reach your hand outward

02:48:00.549 --> 02:48:03.429
and touch an element of its knee, there's this surge

02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:05.699
down your arm of black necrotic energy

02:48:05.699 --> 02:48:08.296
similar to what you guys recently suffered by the gem.

02:48:08.296 --> 02:48:11.519
(activating poofs) And as it impacts around the body

02:48:11.519 --> 02:48:14.029
you watch as the fur, around where your hand touched,

02:48:14.029 --> 02:48:17.349
turns dark gray and then eventually black in that space,

02:48:17.349 --> 02:48:18.369
all up the thigh.

02:48:18.369 --> 02:48:21.209
And it goes (roars) and falls down.

02:48:21.209 --> 02:48:23.389
Now, it's on both knees on the ground.

02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:24.606
It's <i>hurt</i>.

02:48:24.606 --> 02:48:26.339
LAURA: Do I have any movement left?

02:48:26.339 --> 02:48:27.551
MATT: You would have 10 feet left.

02:48:27.551 --> 02:48:29.029
LAURA: Can I back up 10 feet?

02:48:29.029 --> 02:48:30.199
MATT: Sure, yeah.

02:48:30.199 --> 02:48:31.204
LIAM: Jester's complicated.
MATT: It's stunned,

02:48:31.204 --> 02:48:34.180
so it can't do an attack of opportunity on you.

02:48:35.119 --> 02:48:37.289
All righty, that finishes your turn.

02:48:37.289 --> 02:48:38.122
LAURA: Yeah.

02:48:38.122 --> 02:48:38.955
MATT: All right.

02:48:38.955 --> 02:48:42.609
With that, it is now the yetis' turn, the other yetis.

02:48:42.609 --> 02:48:47.367
This one over here goes, "Gestaf!" and ends up running.

02:48:47.367 --> 02:48:48.620
SAM: It's his mother.

02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:52.145
MATT: He's going to attempt to

02:48:52.145 --> 02:48:54.536
grab and throw you back, Veth.

02:48:54.536 --> 02:48:55.632
SAM: Good luck!

02:48:56.540 --> 02:48:57.580
(laughter)

02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:00.132
I'm in-- I'm snow, you can't throw snow!

02:49:00.132 --> 02:49:02.099
Oh wait, you can.

02:49:02.099 --> 02:49:03.740
MATT: You're also not hidden any more

02:49:03.740 --> 02:49:04.598
because you revealed your--

02:49:04.598 --> 02:49:05.469
SAM: I'm snow!

02:49:07.535 --> 02:49:09.508
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:49:09.508 --> 02:49:11.033
TRAVIS: Here we go.
LIAM: 20.

02:49:11.033 --> 02:49:11.866
SAM: Ooh!

02:49:13.116 --> 02:49:14.059
13.

02:49:14.059 --> 02:49:16.749
MATT: It says, "No, you're not!"

02:49:16.749 --> 02:49:18.190
In very clear Common.

02:49:18.190 --> 02:49:19.890
LAURA: Oh no.
SAM: Shit.

02:49:19.890 --> 02:49:21.679
LIAM: Oh no.

02:49:21.679 --> 02:49:23.987
MATT: I need you to make an acrobatics check for me.

02:49:23.987 --> 02:49:26.339
SAM: Acro!
TRAVIS: Maybe they're not yetis.

02:49:26.339 --> 02:49:28.319
SAM: Natural 20.
TRAVIS: Cursed.

02:49:28.319 --> 02:49:31.532
MATT: You weave out of its grasp as it tries to grab you.

02:49:32.429 --> 02:49:35.797
It does put its arms out to protect the larger yeti.

02:49:35.797 --> 02:49:36.710
SAM and LAURA: Oh no!

02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:40.630
TRAVIS: Are these, like, cursed people?
Can yetis make a net?

02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:42.724
LAURA: Yeah, they can make nets.

02:49:42.724 --> 02:49:43.874
SAM: Maybe they stole that

02:49:43.874 --> 02:49:45.831
off someone they killed.
LIAM: Speaks two languages

02:49:45.831 --> 02:49:47.299
and they ambushed us.
LAURA: ♪ They speak ♪

02:49:47.299 --> 02:49:50.207
MATT: You can only get so close.

02:49:50.207 --> 02:49:52.576
You see the one behind there goes, like, "No!"

02:49:52.576 --> 02:49:55.129
and goes running, and it looks over towards you, Yasha,

02:49:55.129 --> 02:49:57.021
because you're the one who it can only get to,

02:49:57.021 --> 02:49:58.639
and as it glares in your direction,

02:49:58.639 --> 02:50:00.449
you look over your shoulder as you go for your blade,

02:50:00.449 --> 02:50:02.159
and you watch his eyes flash blue.

02:50:02.159 --> 02:50:04.459
I need you to make a constitution saving throw for me.

02:50:04.459 --> 02:50:05.609
ASHLEY: Okie doke.

02:50:05.609 --> 02:50:07.947
MATT: Which you're good with.

02:50:09.464 --> 02:50:10.559
ASHLEY: 15.

02:50:10.559 --> 02:50:13.119
MATT: 15 does succeed.

02:50:13.119 --> 02:50:15.562
You shrug off whatever sort of

02:50:15.562 --> 02:50:18.826
piercing, chilled effect it was putting upon your mind.

02:50:18.826 --> 02:50:19.834
ASHLEY: Ah!

02:50:19.834 --> 02:50:21.449
MATT: It's going to go ahead and try and lay into you

02:50:21.449 --> 02:50:23.739
with two claw strikes.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:50:23.739 --> 02:50:26.279
MATT: That is going to be, ooh, not too bad.

02:50:26.279 --> 02:50:27.483
That's going to be a 24 to hit.

02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:28.391
ASHLEY: <i>Ja</i>.

02:50:28.391 --> 02:50:31.138
MATT: And a 19 to hit.
ASHLEY: Yar.

02:50:31.138 --> 02:50:32.988
MATT: All right, you take

02:50:34.563 --> 02:50:36.930
nine points of slashing damage,

02:50:36.930 --> 02:50:40.589
plus three points of cold, so it'll be five,

02:50:40.589 --> 02:50:43.899
and then-- No, it'll be four and then three.

02:50:43.899 --> 02:50:45.724
So you take seven points.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:50:46.653 --> 02:50:48.556
MATT: The other one's going to be
six points of slashing damage,

02:50:48.556 --> 02:50:51.735
reduced to three, and then six points of cold damage.

02:50:51.735 --> 02:50:52.993
That goes straight through.

02:50:54.599 --> 02:50:56.489
That finishes that one's turn.

02:50:56.489 --> 02:50:57.939
This one's going to rush around.

02:50:58.884 --> 02:51:01.629
(running footsteps)

02:51:01.629 --> 02:51:03.959
And come into range with both of you,

02:51:03.959 --> 02:51:06.139
and it's looking frantically between you

02:51:06.139 --> 02:51:08.041
in the direction of the big one,

02:51:08.041 --> 02:51:10.999
and then as it goes, "(gasp)."

02:51:10.999 --> 02:51:13.682
It just looks vengefully pissed in its face

02:51:13.682 --> 02:51:16.997
before it gives this horrible growl, its eyes piercing blue.

02:51:16.997 --> 02:51:17.830
TALIESIN: (whistles)

02:51:17.830 --> 02:51:20.989
I'm actually going to whistle. (whistles)

02:51:20.989 --> 02:51:22.472
MATT: All right. Make a constitution saving throw for me.

02:51:22.472 --> 02:51:24.305
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:51:24.305 --> 02:51:26.324
TRAVIS: With advantage because of the cured whistle?

02:51:26.324 --> 02:51:27.365
MATT: No.

02:51:28.558 --> 02:51:29.666
TALIESIN: Ugh. Nine.

02:51:29.666 --> 02:51:30.557
MATT: Nine.
TALIESIN: Damn it.

02:51:30.557 --> 02:51:33.059
MATT: You whistle, it looks back at you,
its eyes flash blue,

02:51:33.059 --> 02:51:36.562
and suddenly you feel the inner aspect

02:51:36.562 --> 02:51:39.269
of your body freeze solid.

02:51:39.269 --> 02:51:41.830
You are paralyzed for one minute.

02:51:41.830 --> 02:51:43.711
LAURA: Whoa.
TRAVIS: Whoa, that's not--

02:51:43.711 --> 02:51:47.345
LAURA: Oh. These things are meaner than I thought they were.

02:51:47.345 --> 02:51:48.628
MATT: It's going to make two attacks on you

02:51:48.628 --> 02:51:50.239
with advantage because you are now paralyzed.

02:51:50.239 --> 02:51:51.699
LAURA: Oh no.

02:51:51.699 --> 02:51:53.356
TALIESIN: Better me than you.

02:51:53.356 --> 02:51:55.167
MATT: Oh, you also take--

02:51:55.167 --> 02:51:58.486
LIAM: How did they do that? It breathed, it used the eyes?

02:51:58.486 --> 02:52:01.903
TRAVIS: Icy gaze or something. Stare? Icy stare.

02:52:01.903 --> 02:52:03.322
SAM: Did you just make that up?
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:52:03.322 --> 02:52:06.580
MATT: 17 points of whole damage to you,
Caduceus, from that gaze.

02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:07.695
TRAVIS: I don't think so?

02:52:07.695 --> 02:52:08.894
SAM: Frosty specs.

02:52:10.211 --> 02:52:11.344
TRAVIS: Frosted flakes.

02:52:11.344 --> 02:52:12.644
TALIESIN: Took one for the team.

02:52:13.668 --> 02:52:16.159
LAURA: Oh, that was so nice of you, Caduceus.

02:52:16.159 --> 02:52:17.719
TALIESIN: Rather have the wizard up.

02:52:17.719 --> 02:52:19.889
Did you take healing today?

02:52:19.889 --> 02:52:20.988
LAURA: I did!
TALIESIN: Yay.

02:52:20.988 --> 02:52:22.727
MATT: 25 to hit for the first strike.

02:52:22.727 --> 02:52:23.560
TALIESIN: That hits.

02:52:24.485 --> 02:52:25.593
MATT: Natural 20 on the second,

02:52:25.593 --> 02:52:27.901
but it doesn't matter: they're auto-crit
because you're paralyzed.

02:52:27.901 --> 02:52:28.976
LAURA: They're crits?!

02:52:28.976 --> 02:52:31.441
MATT: When you're paralyzed, melee attacks are auto-crits.

02:52:32.559 --> 02:52:34.673
So the first strike against you.

02:52:34.673 --> 02:52:36.339
TALIESIN: I don't suppose my Shield of Retribution works?

02:52:36.339 --> 02:52:37.172
Never mind.
MATT: Nope,

02:52:37.172 --> 02:52:39.809
you can't use your reaction because you're paralyzed.

02:52:39.809 --> 02:52:42.636
So the first strike is going to be

02:52:42.636 --> 02:52:44.001
15 points of slashing damage.

02:52:44.001 --> 02:52:44.849
TALIESIN: Ow.

02:52:46.283 --> 02:52:48.682
MATT: Plus six points of cold damage.

02:52:48.682 --> 02:52:50.029
TALIESIN: Ow.

02:52:50.029 --> 02:52:52.195
MATT: Second one is going to be-- ooh.

02:52:52.195 --> 02:52:55.278
That's going to be 17 points of slashing damage.

02:52:55.278 --> 02:52:57.359
TALIESIN: Did you roll to hit?

02:52:57.359 --> 02:52:59.229
MATT: Yeah, the natural 20 was the second attack.

02:52:59.229 --> 02:53:00.259
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:53:00.259 --> 02:53:02.482
MATT: But they're both critical because--
TALIESIN: Yeah, so it doesn't matter.

02:53:02.482 --> 02:53:03.904
Sorry.
MATT: It's okay.

02:53:03.904 --> 02:53:05.669
And then 10 points of cold damage.

02:53:05.669 --> 02:53:07.449
TALIESIN: So 27 on the second hit?

02:53:07.449 --> 02:53:08.739
MATT: Yes.

02:53:08.739 --> 02:53:09.572
TALIESIN: Ow.

02:53:10.589 --> 02:53:13.061
MATT: And is frantically trying to maneuver through

02:53:13.061 --> 02:53:15.117
and take out whatever it can in the process.

02:53:15.117 --> 02:53:16.359
That finishes its turn.

02:53:16.359 --> 02:53:18.919
Caleb, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

02:53:18.919 --> 02:53:20.172
For your saving throw.

02:53:21.166 --> 02:53:25.159
LIAM: So I just watched Caduceus get laid waste to,

02:53:25.159 --> 02:53:27.829
and all the plans I had just went out of my head,

02:53:27.829 --> 02:53:31.402
and I reach up my hand and put it on my tall friend's

02:53:31.402 --> 02:53:33.987
shoulder and I turn him into a mammoth.

02:53:35.229 --> 02:53:36.062
MATT: Okay.

02:53:38.336 --> 02:53:41.330
TRAVIS: I have no idea what that does in this situation.

02:53:41.330 --> 02:53:42.796
LAURA: Is he a paralyzed mammoth?

02:53:42.796 --> 02:53:44.519
LIAM: Well, he has lots of hit points, though.

02:53:44.519 --> 02:53:46.179
TRAVIS: Yeah, smart.

02:53:46.179 --> 02:53:50.169
LIAM: And I will use my movement to circle around the yeti

02:53:50.169 --> 02:53:52.887
to get him to f-f-flanking position?

02:53:52.887 --> 02:53:53.928
MATT: (laughs) Right there?

02:53:53.928 --> 02:53:55.931
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:53:55.931 --> 02:53:58.452
TRAVIS: Please punch that fucking mammoth.
TALIESIN: How many hit points do I have?

02:53:58.452 --> 02:53:59.921
LIAM: Oh, I'll tell you. One second.

02:53:59.921 --> 02:54:02.019
TALIESIN: As much-- Or I can look up mammoth.

02:54:02.019 --> 02:54:04.359
MATT: After it pulls back with its bloody claws,

02:54:04.359 --> 02:54:07.662
growling angrily, you spin around and it still keeps

02:54:07.662 --> 02:54:09.559
(panicked grunt) looking over towards the rest of the fight

02:54:09.559 --> 02:54:12.189
across the way, and then as it spins around towards you

02:54:12.189 --> 02:54:15.539
it hears the grinding sound of something getting heavier.

02:54:15.539 --> 02:54:18.122
It whips around and (growls),

02:54:18.122 --> 02:54:19.738
looks up at the mammoth growing

02:54:19.738 --> 02:54:23.196
where the "small" firbolg once was, and just goes--

02:54:23.196 --> 02:54:26.569
LIAM: (elephant trumpeting)

02:54:26.569 --> 02:54:30.109
MATT: You see it audibly go, (curse in Yeti).

02:54:30.109 --> 02:54:32.392
You don't know what language it speaks, but it's a curse.

02:54:32.392 --> 02:54:36.639
It is loudly cursing its luck.

02:54:36.639 --> 02:54:37.599
LIAM: Did you find it, Tal?

02:54:37.599 --> 02:54:40.110
TALIESIN: No, not yet, but I'm looking it up.
LIAM: 126 hit points, 126.

02:54:40.110 --> 02:54:41.485
TALIESIN: 126 is good.

02:54:42.869 --> 02:54:43.919
Yeah, I found it.

02:54:43.919 --> 02:54:45.219
MATT: All right.

02:54:45.219 --> 02:54:48.609
Caduceus, you are a mammoth, but you're also paralyzed.

02:54:48.609 --> 02:54:50.097
Make another constitution saving throw for me, please.

02:54:50.097 --> 02:54:52.237
TALIESIN: Do I use the mammoth constitution?

02:54:52.237 --> 02:54:54.009
MATT: Yes, you do.
TALIESIN: I don't have advantage, though.

02:54:54.009 --> 02:54:55.267
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:54:55.267 --> 02:54:57.426
LIAM: He is a pink and green mammoth.

02:54:57.426 --> 02:54:59.989
TALIESIN: Oh, that's 14.

02:54:59.989 --> 02:55:01.421
MATT: 14 will do it. You are--

02:55:01.421 --> 02:55:02.389
At the end of your turn--

02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:04.007
TALIESIN: A much better constitution than I have.

02:55:04.007 --> 02:55:05.269
TRAVIS: Hey, nice.

02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:07.201
LIAM: He is a mammoth at Burning Man.

02:55:07.201 --> 02:55:08.417
TALIESIN: (heavy impact)

02:55:09.784 --> 02:55:11.769
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: This is fun.

02:55:11.769 --> 02:55:13.120
MATT: That finishes your go, Caduceus.

02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:15.395
Top of the round. Veth, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

02:55:15.395 --> 02:55:17.089
SAM: Oh, I'm up!

02:55:17.089 --> 02:55:20.112
Can I see that blade in its chest?

02:55:20.949 --> 02:55:23.149
MATT: Yes, it's a little ways up, but you can probably

02:55:23.149 --> 02:55:26.107
scramble and grab it, if you want to.
SAM: I'm going to scramble up,

02:55:26.107 --> 02:55:29.823
grab the blade, and try to (whooshing) pull it down

02:55:29.823 --> 02:55:31.299
in the chest.
LIAM: Nasty.

02:55:31.299 --> 02:55:32.524
MATT: Go for it.

02:55:32.524 --> 02:55:33.679
LIAM: ♪ Nasty ♪

02:55:33.679 --> 02:55:35.369
MARISHA: You've got advantage.
MATT: Yep.

02:55:35.369 --> 02:55:36.478
SAM: Oh, advantage.

02:55:36.478 --> 02:55:37.819
MATT: Yeah, because he's stunned from Beauregard.

02:55:37.819 --> 02:55:38.989
SAM: Wow, I don't even know--

02:55:38.989 --> 02:55:42.059
Is this-- I just use the dagger's attack.

02:55:42.059 --> 02:55:45.019
So yeah, lots, 29 to hit.

02:55:45.019 --> 02:55:46.412
MATT: 29 definitely hits.

02:55:47.719 --> 02:55:49.814
SAM: And it's sneak attack because he's engaged?

02:55:49.814 --> 02:55:52.279
MATT: Yeah. Well, he's stunned, yeah.

02:55:52.279 --> 02:55:55.927
Any attack that has advantage, you get sneak attack on.

02:55:55.927 --> 02:55:58.236
SAM: Oh god, oh god.

02:55:58.236 --> 02:55:59.702
LIAM: It's not looking good for your big friend here.

02:55:59.702 --> 02:56:01.654
SAM: No, it's not.
MATT: No, not at all.

02:56:01.654 --> 02:56:05.928
SAM: One, two, four, six,

02:56:05.928 --> 02:56:08.794
12, 16,

02:56:11.386 --> 02:56:14.977
21 plus six is 27,

02:56:14.977 --> 02:56:18.171
plus I'll do another one of those (zapping).

02:56:21.262 --> 02:56:23.619
Plus eight is 35.

02:56:23.619 --> 02:56:25.669
MATT: 35, nice.

02:56:25.669 --> 02:56:27.949
TRAVIS: That's nice, that sucks.

02:56:27.949 --> 02:56:29.059
MATT: Yeah, it's looking <i>hurt</i>.

02:56:29.059 --> 02:56:31.069
As you carve the blade down and pull it free

02:56:31.069 --> 02:56:33.729
from its chest, there's this giant gaping wound now

02:56:33.729 --> 02:56:36.169
in its sternum which is starting to just drip

02:56:36.169 --> 02:56:37.919
dark crimson onto the snow around it.

02:56:37.919 --> 02:56:41.363
It's like, (wet grunts).

02:56:41.363 --> 02:56:44.332
LAURA: Aw, I feel bad for it.
MATT: That finishes your turn?

02:56:44.332 --> 02:56:46.347
SAM: Uh, no?

02:56:46.347 --> 02:56:48.029
MATT: What else are you doing?

02:56:48.029 --> 02:56:50.582
SAM: Well, that used some movement, I assume.

02:56:50.582 --> 02:56:53.233
ASHLEY: Can we talk to it?
MATT: I'll say five feet.

02:56:53.233 --> 02:56:56.196
TALIESIN: We're going to wear festive party hats.

02:56:56.196 --> 02:56:57.029
MATT: Sure.

02:56:57.029 --> 02:56:59.669
SAM: No, I'll stay.

02:56:59.669 --> 02:57:02.549
I guess, yeah, I'll stay.

02:57:02.549 --> 02:57:04.539
I'll bonus action...

02:57:06.409 --> 02:57:09.859
I could run away

02:57:09.859 --> 02:57:12.142
but I think you can use flanking

02:57:12.142 --> 02:57:15.059
and shit if I'm on it, so I'll just stay where I am.

02:57:15.059 --> 02:57:16.339
MARISHA: Flanking doesn't matter to me.

02:57:16.339 --> 02:57:19.529
I was just doing it if it mattered to anybody else.

02:57:19.529 --> 02:57:21.734
SAM: All right, well, then, I'll disengage and run away.

02:57:21.734 --> 02:57:22.788
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: That's true.

02:57:22.788 --> 02:57:24.425
MATT: Where you running?

02:57:25.342 --> 02:57:26.630
SAM: Just straight backwards.

02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:28.014
MATT: Straight backward?

02:57:30.028 --> 02:57:32.020
There you go.

02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:34.758
All right, that finishes your go.
MARISHA: Is flanking a deal for any of us here?

02:57:34.758 --> 02:57:36.124
MATT: Yasha, it's your turn.

02:57:36.124 --> 02:57:40.941
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to let out a battle cry

02:57:42.358 --> 02:57:45.589
for Zealous Presence, so everybody within 60 feet

02:57:45.589 --> 02:57:48.149
gains advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

02:57:48.149 --> 02:57:49.899
(cheering)

02:57:49.899 --> 02:57:51.359
ASHLEY: Until my next turn.

02:57:51.359 --> 02:57:56.359
And as I'm screaming out my battle cry,

02:57:56.609 --> 02:58:00.764
I take out Magician's Judge.

02:58:00.764 --> 02:58:02.162
SAM: (slurred) Magician's Judge.

02:58:02.162 --> 02:58:06.329
ASHLEY: And... attack.

02:58:06.329 --> 02:58:08.020
MATT: You've got it. I actually--
ASHLEY: That's a big boy.

02:58:08.020 --> 02:58:11.109
MATT: -- forgot to track Dagen's initiative,
so I'll do that after your turn.

02:58:11.109 --> 02:58:12.249
ASHLEY: Oh, do you want to do it?

02:58:12.249 --> 02:58:13.225
MATT: I'll do it after your turn.

02:58:13.225 --> 02:58:14.879
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:58:14.879 --> 02:58:16.258
So let's see.

02:58:16.258 --> 02:58:19.089
MATT: The net blocked him from my view, weirdly.

02:58:19.089 --> 02:58:20.899
All right, so go for it.

02:58:20.899 --> 02:58:22.069
You're attacking the one right in front of you, right?

02:58:22.069 --> 02:58:27.069
ASHLEY: Yes. Okay, so that would be 24?

02:58:27.249 --> 02:58:28.699
MATT: 24 hits.

02:58:28.699 --> 02:58:30.190
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:58:33.279 --> 02:58:35.462
ASHLEY: I'm going to try Savage Attacker.

02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:38.707
That's better.

02:58:41.449 --> 02:58:45.759
29 points of damage for the first hit.

02:58:45.759 --> 02:58:48.184
MATT: Damn, nice.
SAM: The first tit.

02:58:48.184 --> 02:58:49.819
ASHLEY: Okay, roll that.

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:52.289
LIAM: Aye, the left pap.

02:58:52.289 --> 02:58:55.630
ASHLEY: Okay, so the second hit

02:58:55.630 --> 02:58:58.969
is 23.

02:58:58.969 --> 02:59:00.619
MATT: 23 hits.
ASHLEY: Yep.

02:59:03.585 --> 02:59:05.399
TRAVIS: Going much better lately.

02:59:05.399 --> 02:59:10.106
ASHLEY: Whoa! Well, we had--

02:59:10.106 --> 02:59:11.789
we found some discrepancies.

02:59:11.789 --> 02:59:14.466
I realized I was doing something wrong.

02:59:17.386 --> 02:59:19.345
20 points of damage.
SAM: Yeah!

02:59:19.345 --> 02:59:20.789
MATT: Hell, yeah, well done.

02:59:20.789 --> 02:59:22.189
TRAVIS: I was wondering.

02:59:22.189 --> 02:59:23.563
ASHLEY: Yeah, me, too.

02:59:23.563 --> 02:59:25.579
I was like, what am I doing--?

02:59:25.579 --> 02:59:27.102
MATT: Two heavy cuts, you cut through twice

02:59:27.102 --> 02:59:28.769
(whooshing), the second swipe

02:59:28.769 --> 02:59:30.419
(whooshing) sends a scattering of blood

02:59:30.419 --> 02:59:34.365
across the snow, and the yeti (pained grunt, roar).

02:59:35.421 --> 02:59:37.074
All right, that finishes your turn?

02:59:37.074 --> 02:59:38.641
ASHLEY: (guiltily) Yeah.

02:59:38.641 --> 02:59:40.052
TALIESIN: It's okay.

02:59:41.249 --> 02:59:43.299
It is now the large yeti's turn--

02:59:43.299 --> 02:59:44.940
TRAVIS: You're ready to camp in this thing.
MATT: -- who is stunned.

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:49.748
He's on his knees right now, (growls).

02:59:49.748 --> 02:59:52.105
"Stop!"

02:59:52.105 --> 02:59:53.729
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, he said stop!

02:59:53.729 --> 02:59:56.949
MATT: He falls to one arm on the ground (grunting)

02:59:56.949 --> 02:59:58.899
just bleeding out of the wound in its chest.

02:59:58.899 --> 02:59:59.819
That finishes its turn.

02:59:59.819 --> 03:00:00.652
It's still stunned.

03:00:00.652 --> 03:00:03.933
Beau, you're up. Fjord, you're on deck.
MARISHA: Oh, I hate it when this happens!

03:00:03.933 --> 03:00:06.940
I knew this-- now I have to make the choice!

03:00:06.940 --> 03:00:08.977
TRAVIS: What are you going to do?

03:00:08.977 --> 03:00:10.682
What are you going to do? You heard him.

03:00:10.682 --> 03:00:12.463
You heard him.
MARISHA: Son of a dick.

03:00:12.463 --> 03:00:14.569
MATT: Actually, before your turn, it is Daygen's turn.

03:00:14.569 --> 03:00:17.100
Daygen-- sorry, Daygen should have--

03:00:17.100 --> 03:00:18.354
SAM, LIAM, and MARISHA: Dagen.
MATT: Dagen.

03:00:18.354 --> 03:00:20.015
Fuck it. I have a bird named Dagon!

03:00:20.015 --> 03:00:21.763
I did this to myself!

03:00:21.763 --> 03:00:24.098
TRAVIS: Call him Dagen.
MATT: I did this to myself.

03:00:24.098 --> 03:00:25.056
LIAM: It's Vax, Matt.

03:00:25.056 --> 03:00:28.276
MATT: Dagger Dagen. Dagen Dagen Dagen.

03:00:28.276 --> 03:00:29.579
ASHLEY: Call him Da.

03:00:29.579 --> 03:00:30.412
MATT: It's my own fault.

03:00:30.412 --> 03:00:31.562
SAM: Dageen! How about Dageen?

03:00:31.562 --> 03:00:34.156
MATT: He gets it all the time in school. It's a problem.

03:00:34.156 --> 03:00:36.630
All right, Dagen's turn.

03:00:36.630 --> 03:00:38.619
That's-- why was I even rolling that?

03:00:38.619 --> 03:00:40.419
He's spending his turn. Actually, that's why,

03:00:40.419 --> 03:00:41.494
because he was trying to get out,

03:00:41.494 --> 03:00:43.052
which he has advantage on.

03:00:43.052 --> 03:00:45.048
Which is easy enough to do.

03:00:45.048 --> 03:00:46.321
TRAVIS: "Why am I even rolling?"

03:00:46.321 --> 03:00:47.807
MATT: I did, sorry.

03:00:47.807 --> 03:00:52.740
He goes like, (grunts),

03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:54.398
looks around, surveys the territory

03:00:54.398 --> 03:00:57.693
and goes, "Are we stomping some yetis?"

03:00:57.693 --> 03:01:00.129
And he's going to go ahead and rush over here,

03:01:00.129 --> 03:01:03.649
with Sheila removed, towards the one that's currently

03:01:03.649 --> 03:01:08.649
harrying both Caduceus, and he goes, "That's crazy."

03:01:08.729 --> 03:01:10.511
Wheels up fast and then he's going to go ahead

03:01:10.511 --> 03:01:14.269
and use-- because he can go-- I'd say he moves 10 feet

03:01:14.269 --> 03:01:15.235
in a straight-ish line to it.

03:01:15.235 --> 03:01:17.319
He's going to go ahead and ram with the front of the wheel,

03:01:17.319 --> 03:01:19.044
which has the--
TRAVIS: Hell, yes.

03:01:19.044 --> 03:01:22.354
MATT: -- the pincer at the front to
make an attack against that yeti.

03:01:22.354 --> 03:01:24.289
Oh yeah, that is...

03:01:27.622 --> 03:01:29.096
That's nine-- yeah, that definitely hits.

03:01:29.096 --> 03:01:30.909
SAM: Mercy.

03:01:30.909 --> 03:01:32.379
TALIESIN: Remember what happened with the ghosts.

03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:34.894
MATT: That'll be...

03:01:35.894 --> 03:01:40.894
11 points of bludgeoning damage to that yeti.

03:01:40.996 --> 03:01:44.210
As he just slams into it because he used his action surge

03:01:44.210 --> 03:01:47.825
to get his other action back.
SAM: Action surge. Wait, what is that?

03:01:47.825 --> 03:01:49.299
TRAVIS: He's a fighter.
LAURA: He's a fighter ranger.

03:01:49.299 --> 03:01:50.691
MATT: He's multiclassed.

03:01:51.661 --> 03:01:54.519
And so he rams with the first strike and then brings Sheila

03:01:54.519 --> 03:01:58.085
and goes, "Come on, girl" and does an overhead swing

03:01:58.085 --> 03:02:00.239
with his ax on the second strike.

03:02:00.239 --> 03:02:01.780
That also hits.
MARISHA: He's still stunned

03:02:01.780 --> 03:02:03.055
so I don't know if--

03:02:03.055 --> 03:02:04.779
MATT: Nice-- oh, the guy up there isn't stunned.

03:02:04.779 --> 03:02:06.199
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh.

03:02:06.199 --> 03:02:10.572
MATT: And with Sheila, both hands on this one,

03:02:11.459 --> 03:02:15.879
that's going to be 13 points of slashing damage.

03:02:15.879 --> 03:02:18.499
TRAVIS: Yes, 24 points of damage total.

03:02:18.499 --> 03:02:20.207
That's great.
LIAM: Oh Sheila.

03:02:21.372 --> 03:02:23.969
SAM and LIAM: (Australian accents) Sheila.

03:02:23.969 --> 03:02:25.609
MATT: All right, that's going to end his turn.

03:02:25.609 --> 03:02:28.604
Now, sorry, back to Beau. Fjord, you're on deck.

03:02:29.662 --> 03:02:32.879
TRAVIS: (laughs) You heard him.

03:02:32.879 --> 03:02:33.712
SAM: Tears.

03:02:33.712 --> 03:02:34.958
TRAVIS: You're right there.

03:02:34.958 --> 03:02:36.618
SAM: Tears are mixing with blood.

03:02:36.618 --> 03:02:39.379
MATT: (laughing) There's no tears.

03:02:39.379 --> 03:02:44.379
SAM: You see in his back pocket a letter to his loved ones.

03:02:44.380 --> 03:02:45.746
LIAM: So this is what it sounds--
LAURA: He actually doesn't have a pocket so--

03:02:45.746 --> 03:02:48.104
LIAM: -- like when doves cry.
LAURA: -- it's actually a letter coming out of his butt, but

03:02:48.104 --> 03:02:49.452
it's a letter regardless.

03:02:49.452 --> 03:02:50.810
TRAVIS: ♪ Doves cry. ♪

03:02:51.777 --> 03:02:54.138
TALIESIN: It's a cookbook. I'm sorry.

03:02:54.138 --> 03:02:55.779
MATT: What you doing, Beau?

03:02:55.779 --> 03:02:59.612
MARISHA: I am-- shut up, shut up-- I'm going-- shut up.

03:02:59.612 --> 03:03:03.737
I'm going to vault

03:03:03.737 --> 03:03:07.729
off of his leg, like off of his crouched thigh,

03:03:07.729 --> 03:03:11.149
and get up to his shoulders and I'm going to

03:03:11.149 --> 03:03:12.589
put him in a headlock.

03:03:12.589 --> 03:03:15.138
MATT: Okay, you're attempting to grapple him.

03:03:15.138 --> 03:03:17.554
ASHLEY: Go to sleep, go to sleep.

03:03:17.554 --> 03:03:18.512
MATT: Or are you just holding him?

03:03:18.512 --> 03:03:19.779
MARISHA: I'm just going to hold onto him.

03:03:19.779 --> 03:03:22.099
MATT: Okay, yeah, because he's too big to grapple for you.

03:03:22.099 --> 03:03:22.932
MARISHA: Yes.

03:03:22.932 --> 03:03:24.539
MATT: But, nevertheless, easy--

03:03:24.539 --> 03:03:29.481
MARISHA: I've got, like, a you know, Milla Jovovich thighs

03:03:29.481 --> 03:03:33.652
that I am just like crunching his neck with, you know?

03:03:33.652 --> 03:03:34.959
MATT: All right, there you go.

03:03:34.959 --> 03:03:38.267
So Beauregard is now holding on

03:03:38.267 --> 03:03:41.275
to the sides of a neck that are--

03:03:41.275 --> 03:03:43.819
the neck itself is five times as wide as you are,

03:03:43.819 --> 03:03:45.279
but you have a grip.

03:03:45.279 --> 03:03:46.249
MARISHA: All right.

03:03:46.249 --> 03:03:47.899
And can get in his ear.

03:03:47.899 --> 03:03:50.734
TRAVIS: Hunched on the back of the windshield (laughs).

03:03:50.734 --> 03:03:52.639
(laughter)

03:03:52.639 --> 03:03:53.472
TRAVIS: Relax.

03:03:54.749 --> 03:03:59.082
MARISHA: I'm going to get in his ear and be like,

03:03:59.932 --> 03:04:01.257
"Did you ask to stop?

03:04:01.257 --> 03:04:02.662
Did you ask us to stop?"

03:04:04.229 --> 03:04:07.237
MATT: His response is (pained gasping grunts).

03:04:08.303 --> 03:04:09.136
It took all of the strength

03:04:09.136 --> 03:04:11.349
to get that out because he's dying.
SAM: I'm paralyzed.

03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:14.249
MARISHA: What are you going to do for us if we let you go?

03:04:15.218 --> 03:04:17.209
MATT: He can speak only falteringly as part of the stunned

03:04:17.209 --> 03:04:20.979
condition, so what was your question?

03:04:20.979 --> 03:04:23.654
MARISHA: What are you going to do for us if we let you go?

03:04:24.759 --> 03:04:27.209
MATT: Okay, that is a six-second round.

03:04:27.209 --> 03:04:30.564
MARISHA: Uh huh, my stun is over.

03:04:30.564 --> 03:04:33.053
That was the end of my turn.
MATT: Indeed.

03:04:36.411 --> 03:04:39.019
MARISHA: Does he get to answer me?
TRAVIS: Time will tell. Time will tell.

03:04:39.019 --> 03:04:40.729
LIAM: (low-pitched) Uncle.

03:04:40.729 --> 03:04:43.109
MATT: So this is happening, transpiring
while the rest of the round

03:04:43.109 --> 03:04:45.138
is happening, because you climbed up, grabbed him,

03:04:45.138 --> 03:04:46.815
and began speaking and it's been a little back and forth,

03:04:46.815 --> 03:04:48.231
the stun fades.

03:04:48.231 --> 03:04:50.964
Now, we go to Fjord's turn.

03:04:50.964 --> 03:04:51.922
TRAVIS: I didn't hear any of that shit.

03:04:51.922 --> 03:04:55.469
I'm going to walk up to this-- to the one that Caleb

03:04:55.469 --> 03:04:58.509
and Dagger talked about, yep.

03:04:58.509 --> 03:05:02.179
And I'm going to take two swipes with the Star Razor.

03:05:02.179 --> 03:05:03.095
MATT: Go for it.

03:05:05.359 --> 03:05:08.179
TRAVIS: That's a 21 to hit.

03:05:08.179 --> 03:05:09.510
MATT: 21 hits.

03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:14.309
TRAVIS: And the second one is a... that's better,

03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:16.359
that's a 28 to hit.

03:05:16.359 --> 03:05:18.809
MATT: 28 does indeed hit as well. Roll damage for both.

03:05:18.809 --> 03:05:20.168
TRAVIS: No, wait. 15 plus...

03:05:21.468 --> 03:05:23.047
Yes, 28, that's right.

03:05:26.279 --> 03:05:28.539
I love how it got all quiet because now I'm attacking

03:05:28.539 --> 03:05:30.206
the kids of whatever this thing is.

03:05:30.206 --> 03:05:32.189
(laughter)

03:05:32.189 --> 03:05:34.257
SAM: Not kids, grandkids.

03:05:34.257 --> 03:05:36.422
TRAVIS: That's right. That is...

03:05:36.422 --> 03:05:41.129
11-- yeah, 11 points of slashing damage.

03:05:41.129 --> 03:05:42.179
MATT: 11 points slashing damage.

03:05:42.179 --> 03:05:45.009
TRAVIS: And it shoves him 10 feet away.

03:05:45.009 --> 03:05:47.413
MATT: Colliding with that, which
does an additional five points of

03:05:47.413 --> 03:05:49.486
bludgeoning damage to him.

03:05:49.486 --> 03:05:51.851
So a total of 16 points of damage on that first strike.

03:05:51.851 --> 03:05:53.249
TRAVIS: Do I have to close the distance?

03:05:53.249 --> 03:05:55.489
Use the rest of my speed to meet him again?

03:05:55.489 --> 03:05:57.859
MATT: You would, yes, but you have--

03:05:57.859 --> 03:06:00.026
TRAVIS: I think I only have about 15 feet.
MATT: Yeah, you're good there.

03:06:00.026 --> 03:06:01.482
You move in next to him.

03:06:01.482 --> 03:06:03.209
After he slams into the back of the rock

03:06:03.209 --> 03:06:05.109
and you just rush in, blade ready.

03:06:05.109 --> 03:06:08.592
TRAVIS: Amazing. And that is 16 points of slashing damage

03:06:08.592 --> 03:06:10.604
that shoves him against the rocks again.

03:06:10.604 --> 03:06:11.879
MATT: Only one time for that.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right,

03:06:11.879 --> 03:06:12.829
that's only one time per round, that's right.

03:06:12.829 --> 03:06:13.939
MATT: It's all good.

03:06:13.939 --> 03:06:15.789
So up against him right there, and now he's, like,

03:06:15.789 --> 03:06:18.019
pinned against the rock, taken a few slash wounds

03:06:18.019 --> 03:06:19.749
to the torso, he's looking pretty hurt.

03:06:19.749 --> 03:06:23.386
He's breathing heavy, arms against the rock (panting).

03:06:23.386 --> 03:06:24.669
Looking down at you, looking at the mammoth,

03:06:24.669 --> 03:06:26.186
looking at the mage.

03:06:26.186 --> 03:06:28.252
That finishes Fjord's go. Jester, you're up.

03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:33.239
LAURA: I'm going to assume that I
heard what was going on with Beau,

03:06:33.239 --> 03:06:34.799
since I was standing right in front.

03:06:34.799 --> 03:06:36.699
MATT: You were pretty close, yeah.
You would have picked up on that.

03:06:36.699 --> 03:06:38.774
LAURA: So I'm just going to...

03:06:42.540 --> 03:06:44.341
hold a Guiding Bolt.

03:06:44.341 --> 03:06:45.174
MATT: Okay.

03:06:46.189 --> 03:06:48.539
LAURA: At 2nd-level

03:06:51.955 --> 03:06:56.921
in case Big Mumba-Jumba doesn't

03:06:56.921 --> 03:06:58.199
back off.

03:06:58.199 --> 03:06:59.032
MATT: Okay.

03:06:59.032 --> 03:07:01.329
LAURA: If he acts aggressive, I'm going to hit him.

03:07:01.329 --> 03:07:02.162
MATT: Got it, okay.

03:07:02.162 --> 03:07:02.995
So you're holding that.

03:07:02.995 --> 03:07:04.317
That's your turn?
LAURA: Mm hmm.

03:07:04.317 --> 03:07:06.559
MATT: All right, now the other yetis go.

03:07:06.559 --> 03:07:11.559
This one here turns to the front and is just

03:07:11.779 --> 03:07:13.059
trying to figure out what to do.

03:07:13.059 --> 03:07:14.389
It's looking at you, Beauregard,

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:18.023
and it looks like it's just-- it's in like a stand-off.

03:07:18.023 --> 03:07:19.156
MARISHA: The tinier one?

03:07:19.156 --> 03:07:20.076
MATT: The tiny one right there.
MARISHA: Okay.

03:07:20.076 --> 03:07:22.449
MATT: It's glaring up at you, its eyes sparkling,

03:07:22.449 --> 03:07:27.109
and it's just full on, just stalemate at the moment,

03:07:27.109 --> 03:07:28.811
waiting for the next person to make a move.

03:07:28.811 --> 03:07:30.049
MARISHA: Okay.

03:07:30.049 --> 03:07:31.789
MATT: This one here that was attacking Yasha

03:07:31.789 --> 03:07:33.954
is still going in against Yasha.

03:07:35.019 --> 03:07:37.114
It's now going...

03:07:38.159 --> 03:07:40.159
Actually, you know what? This one...

03:07:42.709 --> 03:07:44.029
Actually, no, that's all it can do.

03:07:44.029 --> 03:07:45.289
It's going to use its Chilling Gaze

03:07:45.289 --> 03:07:46.739
against you once more.

03:07:46.739 --> 03:07:47.779
So go ahead and make another constitution

03:07:47.779 --> 03:07:50.387
saving throw for me.
ASHLEY: Okay, come on.

03:07:55.386 --> 03:07:56.829
MATT: You saved from it previously, right?

03:07:56.829 --> 03:07:57.662
ASHLEY: Say again?

03:07:57.662 --> 03:07:59.087
MATT: You saved from the thing previously?

03:07:59.087 --> 03:08:00.095
ASHLEY: I did.

03:08:00.095 --> 03:08:00.928
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think so.

03:08:00.928 --> 03:08:03.729
MATT: Then you are immune to it.
ASHLEY: To that one?

03:08:03.729 --> 03:08:05.899
MATT: Yeah, so it has no effect on you, never mind.

03:08:05.899 --> 03:08:08.519
So it tries it again, shake it off.

03:08:08.519 --> 03:08:11.539
Angrily, it just goes and tears on you twice with its claws.

03:08:11.539 --> 03:08:14.747
Oh man, that's a 25 to hit.

03:08:14.747 --> 03:08:18.168
ASHLEY: No-- yes, it is.
MATT: And that is going to be a 12 to hit.

03:08:18.168 --> 03:08:19.719
ASHLEY: Okay, halved?

03:08:19.719 --> 03:08:22.999
MATT: So the first one is 11 reduced to five.

03:08:22.999 --> 03:08:23.999
So five slashing damage.

03:08:23.999 --> 03:08:26.282
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh. I see, I see.

03:08:26.282 --> 03:08:27.539
MATT: Those are both tackles, sorry.

03:08:27.539 --> 03:08:29.822
And you take two points of cold damage.

03:08:31.019 --> 03:08:32.059
That's its turn.

03:08:32.059 --> 03:08:34.669
The one over here that's against the wall with you,

03:08:34.669 --> 03:08:36.689
like, surrounded with you, it just

03:08:36.689 --> 03:08:39.869
keeps its hands up and looks over now past the shoulders

03:08:39.869 --> 03:08:41.889
and sees the larger one, and just

03:08:41.889 --> 03:08:43.959
looking for a sign, looking for something.

03:08:43.959 --> 03:08:45.287
It's just waiting.

03:08:45.287 --> 03:08:46.679
So it's holding its action.

03:08:47.919 --> 03:08:51.409
That brings us to Caleb. Caduceus, you're on deck,

03:08:51.409 --> 03:08:52.586
as a mammoth.

03:08:54.851 --> 03:08:56.979
TRAVIS: It used its whole turn to just do that?

03:08:56.979 --> 03:08:58.279
MATT: It's holding its action.

03:08:59.569 --> 03:09:02.159
LIAM: Okay, I can sense a little bit of deescalation here,

03:09:02.159 --> 03:09:07.159
so I'm going to hold Chromatic Orb

03:09:07.250 --> 03:09:09.784
and attack anyone who attacks one of the Mighty Nein.

03:09:09.784 --> 03:09:10.792
MATT: You got it.

03:09:10.792 --> 03:09:12.916
Okay, that finishes your go?
LIAM: Yeah.

03:09:12.916 --> 03:09:14.939
MATT: What's up, mammoth?

03:09:14.939 --> 03:09:16.012
TALIESIN: How smart am I?

03:09:17.279 --> 03:09:20.219
Oh boy, I'm not that smart.

03:09:20.219 --> 03:09:22.356
MATT: What's the intelligence of a mammoth?

03:09:22.356 --> 03:09:24.186
TALIESIN: Three.
MATT: Three, yeah.

03:09:24.186 --> 03:09:26.843
It's not quite a fly.

03:09:26.843 --> 03:09:28.827
TRAVIS: You're half a Grog.
LAURA: A moth.

03:09:28.827 --> 03:09:30.616
MATT: Sorry.
MARISHA: Half a Grog.

03:09:30.616 --> 03:09:33.949
TALIESIN: Wisdom is 11, so would I get the sense

03:09:33.949 --> 03:09:36.349
that this is deescalating, or would I not?

03:09:37.409 --> 03:09:39.029
Watching everyone--

03:09:39.029 --> 03:09:41.149
MATT: I will let you interpret that how you wish.

03:09:41.149 --> 03:09:43.080
I trust you, Taliesin.

03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:43.913
TALIESIN: No,

03:09:46.063 --> 03:09:48.088
so I'm going to just take a standard--

03:09:48.088 --> 03:09:49.329
I'm just going to take a gore attack.

03:09:49.329 --> 03:09:50.162
MATT: Go for it.

03:09:50.162 --> 03:09:51.229
TALIESIN: Since no one's telling me to stop.

03:09:51.229 --> 03:09:52.209
MATT: Okay.

03:09:52.209 --> 03:09:53.042
LIAM: Lock box.

03:09:53.959 --> 03:09:54.996
TALIESIN: And that hits.

03:09:54.996 --> 03:09:56.896
SAM: I invented the internet.

03:09:57.846 --> 03:10:00.086
TALIESIN: That's-- Oh god, that's bad.

03:10:00.086 --> 03:10:00.919
MATT: Okay.

03:10:02.186 --> 03:10:03.566
TALIESIN: That's--

03:10:03.566 --> 03:10:05.966
Where's all the dice I need for this. There's--

03:10:05.966 --> 03:10:07.886
MATT: Oh my god, too many dice.

03:10:07.886 --> 03:10:08.756
What'd you roll to hit?

03:10:08.756 --> 03:10:09.926
TALIESIN: 28.

03:10:09.926 --> 03:10:11.608
MATT: Yeah, you definitely hit. (laughs)

03:10:11.608 --> 03:10:12.574
Just wanted to double check.

03:10:12.574 --> 03:10:13.792
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four.

03:10:13.792 --> 03:10:15.606
Is this right? Yep, so this is--

03:10:15.606 --> 03:10:16.956
Oh no.

03:10:19.086 --> 03:10:20.761
10.
LAURA: He's not saying he has too many.

03:10:20.761 --> 03:10:22.494
TALIESIN: Wait, let me see. Seven.
LAURA: Too many to roll.

03:10:22.494 --> 03:10:24.609
TALIESIN: 10, 15, 21 points of damage.

03:10:24.609 --> 03:10:26.662
MATT: 21 points of damage. Oh!

03:10:26.662 --> 03:10:27.679
TALIESIN: That's what I got.

03:10:28.766 --> 03:10:30.269
SAM: How do you want to do this?

03:10:32.586 --> 03:10:33.454
MATT: Yeah, he falls.

03:10:33.454 --> 03:10:36.056
(gasping)
LAURA: Oh, buddy.

03:10:36.056 --> 03:10:39.342
TALIESIN: I was a mammoth.

03:10:39.342 --> 03:10:42.106
MATT: He is-- as you just gore him with the horns,

03:10:42.106 --> 03:10:43.126
he's like waiting

03:10:43.126 --> 03:10:46.598
and as soon as he turns to try and defend himself,

03:10:46.598 --> 03:10:47.431
(groaning)

03:10:47.431 --> 03:10:49.916
you gore him with the horns and lift him up off the ground.

03:10:49.916 --> 03:10:53.088
As they pull out, he falls to the ground unconscious.

03:10:53.088 --> 03:10:55.516
TRAVIS: We're getting [inaudible].

03:10:55.516 --> 03:10:56.349
MATT: The other

03:10:58.106 --> 03:10:58.939
back there

03:10:59.806 --> 03:11:01.526
he'll be coming up in a bit,

03:11:01.526 --> 03:11:05.516
but you sense the tension suddenly escalate immensely

03:11:05.516 --> 03:11:08.646
in the middle of this battlefield.

03:11:08.646 --> 03:11:09.726
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:11:09.726 --> 03:11:11.959
That brings us-- and then

03:11:13.456 --> 03:11:14.586
Dagen, who sees this

03:11:14.586 --> 03:11:17.966
and is currently after this whole circumstance goes like,

03:11:19.329 --> 03:11:20.493
"That's not too bad."

03:11:21.672 --> 03:11:23.068
"It might be."

03:11:23.068 --> 03:11:25.613
He looks over his shoulder at the rest and goes like,

03:11:25.613 --> 03:11:28.423
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,"

03:11:28.423 --> 03:11:31.805
and he spins and rolls up here

03:11:31.805 --> 03:11:33.163
and goes,

03:11:33.163 --> 03:11:34.941
"I sense we have

03:11:34.941 --> 03:11:37.459
"Allowak folk,

03:11:37.459 --> 03:11:38.292
"right?"

03:11:39.721 --> 03:11:41.271
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

03:11:41.271 --> 03:11:43.213
MATT: "Can anybody," and he looks over at you,

03:11:43.213 --> 03:11:44.966
"Anybody,"

03:11:44.966 --> 03:11:46.774
and points over to the one that's now lying,

03:11:46.774 --> 03:11:48.425
bleeding out in the snow.

03:11:48.425 --> 03:11:49.302
SAM: Heal.

03:11:50.316 --> 03:11:51.186
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:51.186 --> 03:11:53.546
MATT: That brings us to Veth's go.

03:11:53.546 --> 03:11:55.426
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: You can heal, right?

03:11:55.426 --> 03:11:58.578
SAM: I've got a potion.

03:11:58.578 --> 03:11:59.411
ASHLEY: I can heal.

03:11:59.411 --> 03:12:01.759
SAM: I will, I'll just pass.

03:12:02.654 --> 03:12:03.487
TRAVIS: Hold your holding.

03:12:03.487 --> 03:12:06.666
SAM: I'll hold a-- yeah, a crossbow attack

03:12:06.666 --> 03:12:08.953
if things go south.
MATT: Okay.

03:12:08.953 --> 03:12:10.116
Yasha, it's your turn.

03:12:10.116 --> 03:12:13.746
You can see now as the yeti, stabbed, fallen,

03:12:13.746 --> 03:12:16.266
bleeding out. All the other yetis are turning

03:12:16.266 --> 03:12:18.236
and looking. Even the big one, that is currently

03:12:18.236 --> 03:12:21.916
taking a moment of calm with Beau on the back,

03:12:21.916 --> 03:12:24.276
eyes just flick up at its fallen comrade

03:12:24.276 --> 03:12:26.426
and you can see rage building in its face.

03:12:26.426 --> 03:12:27.566
What are you doing?

03:12:27.566 --> 03:12:31.875
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to walk over
to the one that has fallen.

03:12:31.875 --> 03:12:33.609
MATT: Okay.

03:12:33.609 --> 03:12:35.256
SAM: To the one that has fallen.

03:12:35.256 --> 03:12:37.916
ASHLEY: To the one has fallen.

03:12:37.916 --> 03:12:39.486
And then,

03:12:39.486 --> 03:12:42.196
I'm going to take my hands and

03:12:43.296 --> 03:12:46.496
shove them into the chest of the fur,

03:12:46.496 --> 03:12:48.856
stand them up and then heal him for a

03:12:49.896 --> 03:12:50.941
Healing Hands.

03:12:50.941 --> 03:12:52.881
TRAVIS: I thought that was going every way.
LAURA: I know.

03:12:52.881 --> 03:12:55.064
Rip him in half.
MATT: Just Mortal Kombat it?

03:12:55.064 --> 03:12:57.056
(roaring)
LAURA: (heart beat)

03:12:57.056 --> 03:12:58.011
TRAVIS: Tastes like bugs.

03:12:58.011 --> 03:13:00.497
ASHLEY: And then I'm going to scream out:

03:13:00.497 --> 03:13:02.556
Are we fucking done?

03:13:02.556 --> 03:13:04.189
MATT: All right, how much do you heal him for?

03:13:07.165 --> 03:13:08.798
SAM: One point.

03:13:08.798 --> 03:13:09.956
TRAVIS: 13.

03:13:09.956 --> 03:13:12.020
LIAM: ♪ One. ♪
ASHLEY: That is 13 hit points.

03:13:12.020 --> 03:13:12.853
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:13:12.853 --> 03:13:14.696
LIAM: ♪ Is the loneliest number ♪

03:13:14.696 --> 03:13:17.459
MATT: As you lift him up-- This is a massive creature.

03:13:17.459 --> 03:13:18.869
It weighs

03:13:20.076 --> 03:13:22.166
close to a thousand pounds.

03:13:22.166 --> 03:13:25.216
But you are raging and you are furious

03:13:25.216 --> 03:13:27.826
and you have the wall to use to lean it up.

03:13:27.826 --> 03:13:32.826
So as you angrily lift and slam it up and heal it,

03:13:32.876 --> 03:13:36.956
its limp knees lock into place, his eyes roll back open.

03:13:36.956 --> 03:13:37.985
TRAVIS: Dead lift.

03:13:37.985 --> 03:13:39.644
MATT: "(gasping)"

03:13:39.644 --> 03:13:40.744
ASHLEY: Then I'm going to keep him standing

03:13:40.744 --> 03:13:43.666
with my hand up against the wall.
MATT: Just holding him there.

03:13:43.666 --> 03:13:45.166
Okay, that finishes your turn.

03:13:46.576 --> 03:13:47.409
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:13:47.409 --> 03:13:48.409
MATT: All right.

03:13:48.409 --> 03:13:52.696
It is now the large yeti who the rage in the face

03:13:52.696 --> 03:13:55.859
sits there, still tense. It gets back up on one leg,

03:13:57.966 --> 03:13:59.916
throws it spear to the ground and goes,

03:14:01.005 --> 03:14:04.338
"Hold!

03:14:04.338 --> 03:14:06.803
"(defeated grunting)

03:14:06.803 --> 03:14:08.196
"This is done.

03:14:10.403 --> 03:14:13.446
"(defeated grunting)."

03:14:13.446 --> 03:14:14.919
And unless anyone has any other actions,

03:14:14.919 --> 03:14:16.415
the combat comes to a close.

03:14:17.654 --> 03:14:20.376
(groaning)

03:14:22.166 --> 03:14:24.216
TALIESIN: I can do a cool thing I didn't get to do.

03:14:25.136 --> 03:14:26.066
SAM: As the mammoth?

03:14:26.066 --> 03:14:27.666
TALIESIN: Mammoth can do a trample charge,

03:14:27.666 --> 03:14:29.113
where I can run up to somebody

03:14:29.113 --> 03:14:31.066
and gore them and then stomp on them.

03:14:31.066 --> 03:14:31.926
LAURA: It's awesome.
SAM: Do it.

03:14:31.926 --> 03:14:33.636
TALIESIN: It's really cool. No.

03:14:33.636 --> 03:14:35.144
TRAVIS: Another day.
TALIESIN: I'm good.

03:14:35.144 --> 03:14:38.636
LAURA: Being a mammoth is super cool.

03:14:38.636 --> 03:14:40.616
MATT: So the tension's still high.

03:14:40.616 --> 03:14:44.516
The massive yeti gets up on its other foot

03:14:44.516 --> 03:14:46.446
and glances over its shoulder at you

03:14:46.446 --> 03:14:49.413
and goes, "You can release me."

03:14:51.246 --> 03:14:53.966
MARISHA: I loosen my grasp,

03:14:53.966 --> 03:14:55.456
but I don't go anywhere yet.

03:14:55.456 --> 03:14:56.576
MATT: You're still clutching his back?

03:14:56.576 --> 03:14:57.409
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:14:57.409 --> 03:14:59.295
TRAVIS: Still just hanging on the back.
MARISHA: Hanging on.

03:14:59.295 --> 03:15:00.626
On his shoulder.

03:15:00.626 --> 03:15:01.709
MATT: He goes, "(deep sigh)"

03:15:01.709 --> 03:15:03.989
MARISHA: Fucked up Jiminy Cricket.

03:15:05.156 --> 03:15:08.876
MATT: Stumbles towards the center of where the net was

03:15:08.876 --> 03:15:11.276
and looks down towards Dagen and goes,

03:15:12.693 --> 03:15:14.776
"You're correct."

03:15:14.776 --> 03:15:18.946
Looks at the other yeti calls them over.

03:15:18.946 --> 03:15:20.319
Do you let them approach?

03:15:21.266 --> 03:15:22.116
TRAVIS: Sure.

03:15:27.246 --> 03:15:28.571
MATT: The bigger one goes,

03:15:34.053 --> 03:15:36.003
"Often,

03:15:36.003 --> 03:15:38.459
"people who come from your end are...

03:15:41.063 --> 03:15:42.613
"poachers.

03:15:44.343 --> 03:15:47.115
"Not much for conversation.

03:15:49.861 --> 03:15:51.913
"And we've a lost few,

03:15:51.913 --> 03:15:55.893
"so to take the first swipe made the most sense.

03:15:58.693 --> 03:15:59.526
"But

03:16:01.333 --> 03:16:02.491
"I ask you,

03:16:03.613 --> 03:16:05.753
"What would you do with us now?"

03:16:08.585 --> 03:16:10.126
LIAM: We are just going to

03:16:11.866 --> 03:16:12.906
walk on through,

03:16:14.436 --> 03:16:15.494
but, um--

03:16:16.966 --> 03:16:19.956
and I'm just going to share some food,

03:16:19.956 --> 03:16:21.856
please no sudden movements.

03:16:21.856 --> 03:16:25.326
And I pull out the jar of boba

03:16:25.326 --> 03:16:26.419
and a cloth.

03:16:27.636 --> 03:16:30.146
Please don't attack, please.

03:16:30.146 --> 03:16:32.136
Please. Put the cloth down,

03:16:32.136 --> 03:16:35.366
and I take the lid off the jar and I pour like

03:16:36.386 --> 03:16:39.346
50 boba out of the jar and into the cloth.

03:16:39.346 --> 03:16:40.936
MARISHA: Freezes instantly.

03:16:40.936 --> 03:16:42.986
LIAM: Don't eat more than one of those a day

03:16:42.986 --> 03:16:45.446
or you will get incontinent, but

03:16:46.466 --> 03:16:48.356
one a day will do you.

03:16:48.356 --> 03:16:50.523
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:16:55.356 --> 03:16:57.339
LIAM: That is 14.

03:16:57.339 --> 03:16:59.686
LAURA: It's not terrible.
MATT: 14. That's not too bad.

03:16:59.686 --> 03:17:02.596
You watch as they all stare at you.

03:17:02.596 --> 03:17:03.626
Kind of glare a bit.

03:17:03.626 --> 03:17:07.076
And the one that's holding on,
barely brought back to life

03:17:07.076 --> 03:17:09.046
by you, limps forward towards it.

03:17:09.046 --> 03:17:13.262
It looks at you and reaches over
and takes like four in his hand, and goes--

03:17:13.262 --> 03:17:15.963
LIAM: You are going to have the shits.

03:17:15.963 --> 03:17:17.201
MATT: "I'm bigger."

03:17:23.181 --> 03:17:25.431
(growling)

03:17:27.563 --> 03:17:28.773
"Nice and filling."

03:17:30.461 --> 03:17:31.629
And the big one goes,

03:17:33.663 --> 03:17:34.993
"You let us live?"

03:17:36.446 --> 03:17:38.263
MARISHA: You're not our quarry.

03:17:38.263 --> 03:17:39.900
MATT: "What is your quarry?"

03:17:42.026 --> 03:17:43.491
LIAM: Other people like us.

03:17:44.556 --> 03:17:45.746
MARISHA: Happen to see a...

03:17:47.976 --> 03:17:49.616
purple tiefling?

03:17:49.616 --> 03:17:51.906
Looks like her running around,

03:17:51.906 --> 03:17:55.063
but purple?
TRAVIS: Lavender.

03:17:55.063 --> 03:17:56.265
MATT: "About a day ago.

03:17:56.265 --> 03:17:57.198
LAURA and TRAVIS: (gasp)

03:17:57.198 --> 03:18:00.835
MATT: "Passing through the same path,
direction you're headed.

03:18:02.043 --> 03:18:04.173
"We decided not to engage.

03:18:04.173 --> 03:18:07.326
"They had strange magic about them."

03:18:07.326 --> 03:18:09.146
MARISHA: How do you mean?

03:18:09.146 --> 03:18:12.213
How could you tell that they had strange magic?

03:18:12.213 --> 03:18:14.583
MATT: "Because they saw us and

03:18:14.583 --> 03:18:17.349
"beckoned us stay at bay and not get involved.

03:18:18.779 --> 03:18:22.796
"And then showed some really, really strange magic."

03:18:22.796 --> 03:18:24.539
MARISHA: How many were with them?
SAM: Yeah.

03:18:24.539 --> 03:18:27.297
MATT: "Five total."
LAURA: Five.

03:18:27.297 --> 03:18:28.813
SAM: So hi, snow here,

03:18:28.813 --> 03:18:32.433
can you tell me what the other ones looked like?

03:18:32.433 --> 03:18:34.403
MATT: "I didn't get that good of a look.

03:18:34.403 --> 03:18:36.089
"A lot of them wearing similar

03:18:37.103 --> 03:18:38.983
"bundles as you,

03:18:38.983 --> 03:18:41.007
"though not as fancy.

03:18:43.353 --> 03:18:45.423
"But anyway,

03:18:45.423 --> 03:18:46.753
"will you let us live?"

03:18:49.740 --> 03:18:51.576
LAURA: Well, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:18:51.576 --> 03:18:53.376
Like I said, we're not here for you.

03:18:53.376 --> 03:18:55.649
SAM: Are these smaller ones your family?

03:18:56.659 --> 03:18:58.919
MATT: "No, they're just other members of the...

03:19:01.143 --> 03:19:02.476
"community."

03:19:04.526 --> 03:19:06.996
MARISHA: What did Dagen say? You said you're a part of a--

03:19:06.996 --> 03:19:08.466
LIAM: You are.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:19:08.466 --> 03:19:09.674
MARISHA: You're what folk?

03:19:09.674 --> 03:19:11.336
MATT: Dagen pipes in and goes,

03:19:11.336 --> 03:19:13.073
"Yeah, you see there's a--

03:19:14.390 --> 03:19:19.369
"It's kind of a small community of yetis around the corner

03:19:20.543 --> 03:19:22.463
"called the Sanctuary.

03:19:22.463 --> 03:19:24.267
"Allowak Sanctuary."

03:19:24.267 --> 03:19:25.703
MARISHA: Allowak?

03:19:25.703 --> 03:19:27.400
MATT: "Yeah. Only--

03:19:29.007 --> 03:19:31.189
"only a few folks really pay much mind to it,

03:19:31.189 --> 03:19:32.743
"since it's a bunch of these folks.

03:19:32.743 --> 03:19:36.293
"It's both dangerous to pass by unwarranted and,

03:19:36.293 --> 03:19:37.126
"well, as you noticed,

03:19:37.126 --> 03:19:40.143
"they seemed to have a keener intellect than

03:19:40.143 --> 03:19:42.083
"standard beasts we're used to.

03:19:44.153 --> 03:19:44.986
"But."

03:19:44.986 --> 03:19:46.851
TRAVIS: Oh, it's on the map, yes, of course.

03:19:46.851 --> 03:19:49.926
Yeah, no, it says
"Allowak's Sanctuary," right...

03:19:51.426 --> 03:19:52.537
right here.

03:19:52.537 --> 03:19:54.686
MATT: The large one goes over and looks over your shoulder

03:19:54.686 --> 03:19:57.846
and goes, "How many know about it?"

03:19:57.846 --> 03:20:01.988
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I believe this is
the only copy, so just-- just us.

03:20:08.156 --> 03:20:10.294
MARISHA: Are there any sort of other settlements of you all

03:20:10.294 --> 03:20:12.739
that we should keep an eye out for as we move forward?

03:20:14.456 --> 03:20:16.356
MATT: Sits down now that it realizes

03:20:16.356 --> 03:20:19.456
the tension's passed, the larger one goes-- (crash)

03:20:19.456 --> 03:20:21.106
and almost has this weird

03:20:21.106 --> 03:20:22.876
unexpected teddy bear-like qualities as he's

03:20:22.876 --> 03:20:26.459
now in the sitting position tending to his wounds a bit.

03:20:28.803 --> 03:20:32.286
"It's hard to explain, but we're not like other yeti."

03:20:32.286 --> 03:20:34.206
MARISHA: No, we gathered that

03:20:34.206 --> 03:20:36.856
as soon as you started speaking Common towards us.

03:20:38.459 --> 03:20:39.729
MATT: "But there are yeti out there

03:20:39.729 --> 03:20:41.113
"that aren't like us either.

03:20:41.113 --> 03:20:42.709
"So I can't assure that

03:20:44.703 --> 03:20:46.753
"all of the kind of ours you might encounter

03:20:46.753 --> 03:20:48.223
"are as cordial.

03:20:50.203 --> 03:20:52.913
"But we like to keep to ourselves

03:20:52.913 --> 03:20:53.943
"unless pressured.

03:20:54.783 --> 03:20:56.653
"We hunt to survive.

03:20:57.623 --> 03:21:01.989
"If you can promise not cause any trouble or to share

03:21:03.353 --> 03:21:05.923
"this map and knowledge of the Sanctuary,

03:21:08.413 --> 03:21:09.246
"we can...

03:21:11.463 --> 03:21:13.563
"we can carry along with you for the day

03:21:13.563 --> 03:21:15.353
"and keep an eye out.

03:21:16.813 --> 03:21:19.296
"Watch your backs as you watch ours."

03:21:19.296 --> 03:21:22.596
LAURA: We're going to be best friends with a bunch of yeti?!

03:21:22.596 --> 03:21:25.492
MARISHA: Greatly appreciated, as you can tell

03:21:25.492 --> 03:21:28.636
my blue friend is very excited.

03:21:28.636 --> 03:21:29.875
LAURA: Do you need healing?

03:21:29.875 --> 03:21:31.691
I'm a healer.

03:21:31.691 --> 03:21:32.746
MATT: "Please."

03:21:32.746 --> 03:21:33.996
LAURA: Okay.

03:21:33.996 --> 03:21:36.496
I use a 3rd-level Cure Wounds.

03:21:36.496 --> 03:21:37.667
MARISHA: Wow.
MATT: Okay.

03:21:37.667 --> 03:21:40.616
MARISHA: What's-- ever used for us.

03:21:40.616 --> 03:21:42.227
TALIESIN: Wow, we see where we stand.

03:21:42.227 --> 03:21:43.060
(laughter)

03:21:43.060 --> 03:21:47.267
LIAM: I look at it and I go, "Eh,"
and I release Caduceus from--

03:21:47.267 --> 03:21:48.726
(laughter)

03:21:48.726 --> 03:21:50.323
TALIESIN: I remember everything.

03:21:50.323 --> 03:21:53.986
(laughter)

03:21:53.986 --> 03:21:56.823
TALIESIN: I'm just going to sit and do a quick 10-minute--

03:21:56.823 --> 03:21:57.656
MATT: Okay.

03:21:57.656 --> 03:22:02.007
TALIESIN: And anybody who needs-- yeti included.
Anybody who needs the--

03:22:02.007 --> 03:22:04.674
MATT: The normal yeti, the smaller ones.

03:22:04.674 --> 03:22:06.932
There's still a bit of tension, but they eventually calm,

03:22:06.932 --> 03:22:08.536
especially as healing is being passed out

03:22:08.536 --> 03:22:12.496
and eventually one of them pulls out a small

03:22:12.496 --> 03:22:14.626
notebook of some kind and starts writing in it.

03:22:14.626 --> 03:22:16.176
SAM: Aww.

03:22:16.176 --> 03:22:18.656
MATT: Some of the other start bandaging a little bit

03:22:18.656 --> 03:22:21.556
and getting their supplies, start recollecting the net.

03:22:21.556 --> 03:22:23.476
And they're not much for immediate conversation,

03:22:23.476 --> 03:22:26.536
but there's not any sort of aggression at this point.

03:22:26.536 --> 03:22:29.966
Seems the largest one is the most diplomatic.

03:22:29.966 --> 03:22:32.653
TALIESIN: 26 healing points to whoever really needs them.

03:22:32.653 --> 03:22:34.906
LAURA: And 18 points to the big one.

03:22:34.906 --> 03:22:36.996
MATT: Yeah, awesome. The yeti are going to take that.

03:22:36.996 --> 03:22:39.325
TALIESIN: I've had the best roll I've ever had for healing.

03:22:39.325 --> 03:22:42.576
MARISHA: The one that's writing in the notebook.

03:22:42.576 --> 03:22:43.742
MATT: Yeah?

03:22:43.742 --> 03:22:45.066
MARISHA: Which one is that?

03:22:46.146 --> 03:22:49.379
MATT: That would be the one that was trying to--

03:22:49.379 --> 03:22:51.120
that was on the other side of the large one.

03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:53.273
The one that rushed in and was trying to

03:22:53.273 --> 03:22:55.323
LAURA: There's a little one writing in a notebook?!

03:22:55.323 --> 03:22:56.416
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

03:22:56.416 --> 03:23:00.106
MARISHA: Can I-- can I scooch up to
the one that's writing in the note book?

03:23:00.106 --> 03:23:02.416
MATT: Yeah, as you do, he looks at you
and pulls the notebook away.

03:23:02.416 --> 03:23:04.636
TALIESIN: Two of us and I'm not--

03:23:04.636 --> 03:23:06.636
MARISHA: I do call over Jester.

03:23:08.442 --> 03:23:09.958
It's okay. I--

03:23:11.406 --> 03:23:12.936
Take notes, too.

03:23:12.936 --> 03:23:16.366
She draws pictures, it's like her version.

03:23:16.366 --> 03:23:17.766
MATT: "Okay."

03:23:17.766 --> 03:23:20.623
LAURA: What'd you do? Do you draw or do you write or--?

03:23:20.623 --> 03:23:21.986
MATT: "It's my diary."

03:23:21.986 --> 03:23:23.157
SAM: Oh.

03:23:23.157 --> 03:23:24.486
ASHLEY: Oh!

03:23:24.486 --> 03:23:26.689
SAM: We were going to kill him.

03:23:26.689 --> 03:23:30.116
TRAVIS: It's one word. It says "Sad."
MARISHA: This is kind of like my diary.

03:23:30.116 --> 03:23:30.949
I'll--

03:23:32.776 --> 03:23:34.886
I'll let you read my last entry,

03:23:34.886 --> 03:23:36.509
if you let me read yours.

03:23:38.336 --> 03:23:41.636
MATT: "I don't really know you that well."

03:23:41.636 --> 03:23:43.146
MARISHA: Who-- what do you have to lose?

03:23:43.146 --> 03:23:46.199
I'm an unbiased third party.

03:23:46.199 --> 03:23:47.691
MATT: "My privacy."

03:23:47.691 --> 03:23:50.116
(laughter)

03:23:50.116 --> 03:23:52.506
MARISHA: You know, sometimes if you open up to a stranger,

03:23:52.506 --> 03:23:53.734
it can actually make you feel

03:23:53.734 --> 03:23:55.136
a little bit better.
TRAVIS: Are you pushing a yeti?

03:23:55.136 --> 03:23:56.163
MARISHA: Yeah, a little bit.

03:23:56.163 --> 03:23:58.205
SAM: Show me your diary.
MATT: Make a--

03:23:58.205 --> 03:23:59.916
MARISHA: Let me read your diary, bro.

03:23:59.916 --> 03:24:03.199
MATT: You may make a persuasion or
intimidation check, your call.

03:24:03.199 --> 03:24:04.032
MARISHA: What!

03:24:04.032 --> 03:24:05.994
TRAVIS: Maybe one is better
than the other in this situation.

03:24:05.994 --> 03:24:08.431
MARISHA: But it's better for me.

03:24:08.431 --> 03:24:09.982
SAM: Henry.
MARISHA: They're the same.

03:24:09.982 --> 03:24:11.648
LIAM: (as Henry Crabgrass) Consent, please.
MATT: Then your choice.

03:24:11.648 --> 03:24:13.903
MARISHA: Persuasion because I'm not trying to be mean.

03:24:13.903 --> 03:24:16.954
MATT: I know, but there are
different ways to interpret this.

03:24:16.954 --> 03:24:20.156
MARISHA: Oh yikes, I rolled a two.

03:24:20.156 --> 03:24:21.281
MATT: For a total of--?

03:24:21.281 --> 03:24:22.516
MARISHA: Three.

03:24:22.516 --> 03:24:23.919
TRAVIS: Listen to the dice.

03:24:23.919 --> 03:24:25.402
SAM: (as Henry Crabgrass) No means no.

03:24:25.402 --> 03:24:29.216
(laughter)

03:24:29.216 --> 03:24:31.383
MATT: The yeti goes,

03:24:31.383 --> 03:24:34.286
"Oh, no."

03:24:34.286 --> 03:24:35.363
Puts it away.

03:24:35.363 --> 03:24:39.375
"It's just very personal, I hope you understand."

03:24:39.375 --> 03:24:40.723
MARISHA: I do.

03:24:40.723 --> 03:24:43.231
MATT: "Okay."
MARISHA: I deeply do.

03:24:44.336 --> 03:24:45.169
Yeah.

03:24:45.169 --> 03:24:46.626
MATT: "I'm going to get up now."

03:24:46.626 --> 03:24:47.459
MARISHA: Okay.

03:24:47.459 --> 03:24:50.233
TRAVIS: And I'll walk over to the larger yeti and I'll say:

03:24:50.233 --> 03:24:52.423
I'm sorry to harp on this, but

03:24:52.423 --> 03:24:55.716
that purple tiefling you mentioned.

03:24:55.716 --> 03:24:56.926
What time of day is it, anyway?

03:24:56.926 --> 03:24:57.878
It's, like, midday?

03:24:57.878 --> 03:25:01.118
MATT: At this point, I'd say it's a little bit past noon.

03:25:01.118 --> 03:25:02.356
You guys left pretty early.

03:25:02.356 --> 03:25:05.413
TRAVIS: You saw them the day prior, yes?

03:25:05.413 --> 03:25:06.556
MATT: "Roughly, yeah."

03:25:06.556 --> 03:25:08.654
Was it in the morning, in the evening?

03:25:08.654 --> 03:25:10.815
We're trying to figure out how far behind--

03:25:10.815 --> 03:25:12.373
MARISHA: Yeah. Time, time.

03:25:12.373 --> 03:25:15.066
MATT: "It was maybe late morning."

03:25:15.066 --> 03:25:16.591
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: About a day.

03:25:16.591 --> 03:25:19.166
MARISHA: So they're like one full day ahead of us, okay.

03:25:19.166 --> 03:25:20.391
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:25:21.548 --> 03:25:22.776
MARISHA: All right.

03:25:22.776 --> 03:25:25.566
TALIESIN: I'm just going to go up to the one I killed.

03:25:25.566 --> 03:25:26.399
MATT: Yeah.

03:25:26.399 --> 03:25:28.596
TALIESIN: I really-- I was an elephant at the time.

03:25:28.596 --> 03:25:30.476
I feel really bad about that.

03:25:30.476 --> 03:25:33.523
I didn't really get that we were backing off.

03:25:33.523 --> 03:25:34.665
MATT: "I'm going to be honest.

03:25:34.665 --> 03:25:36.723
"I always assumed it'd be a mammoth that took me out.

03:25:36.723 --> 03:25:39.573
"I just didn't figure it would be like, not a real one,

03:25:39.573 --> 03:25:41.896
"which is kind of blowing my mind right now.

03:25:41.896 --> 03:25:44.796
TALIESIN: Would you be willing to accept a gift to help me

03:25:46.036 --> 03:25:48.153
lift my conscience a little bit?

03:25:49.053 --> 03:25:50.126
MATT: "Sure."

03:25:50.126 --> 03:25:51.999
TALIESIN: I give him a celebone.

03:25:52.884 --> 03:25:55.467
LAURA: (gasps)
TALIESIN: And show how to use it.

03:25:56.839 --> 03:25:58.210
LAURA: (club music noises)

03:25:58.210 --> 03:26:00.456
MARISHA: Oh, that right, one of those!
SAM: What does it do?

03:26:00.456 --> 03:26:03.416
MATT: He takes it and it starts glowing.

03:26:03.416 --> 03:26:04.866
He starts swinging it.
MARISHA: Glow sticks.

03:26:04.866 --> 03:26:06.517
MATT: And the other yetis go--

03:26:06.517 --> 03:26:08.286
"What? That's not fair!"

03:26:08.286 --> 03:26:09.569
They start running for it, he's like,

03:26:09.569 --> 03:26:12.576
"No, he gave it to me, I'm the one who died!"

03:26:12.576 --> 03:26:14.867
They're like-- (huffs)
TRAVIS: "That's not fair!"

03:26:14.867 --> 03:26:17.528
TALIESIN: It'll go for about an hour
or you can just turn it off.

03:26:17.528 --> 03:26:20.900
Like an hour a day or you can
just turn it off when you want.

03:26:20.900 --> 03:26:23.078
LIAM: ♪ Books and cats and books and cats ♪
But it's yours, but you can share it.

03:26:23.078 --> 03:26:24.806
I'd recommend-- you know, let people--

03:26:24.806 --> 03:26:27.266
MATT: He reaches out and palms the top of your head

03:26:27.266 --> 03:26:29.641
and like messes with your hair and goes,

03:26:29.641 --> 03:26:30.716
"Thank you."

03:26:30.716 --> 03:26:33.833
TALIESIN: Thank you for not murdering
me when I was tiny, it's okay.

03:26:33.833 --> 03:26:35.513
MATT: "Well...

03:26:35.513 --> 03:26:36.589
"thank you for...

03:26:37.743 --> 03:26:39.332
"this."

03:26:39.332 --> 03:26:40.988
TALIESIN: Yeah, there we are.

03:26:40.988 --> 03:26:45.286
MATT: Yeah, it's-- his one hand
goes around both of your arms.

03:26:45.286 --> 03:26:46.626
TALIESIN: I feel good about that.

03:26:46.626 --> 03:26:48.106
TRAVIS: We should keep going, though,

03:26:48.106 --> 03:26:50.347
especially if they have a lead on us.

03:26:50.347 --> 03:26:52.164
MATT: "Right." The big one stands up.

03:26:52.164 --> 03:26:54.216
SAM: I'm going to just find some snow,

03:26:54.216 --> 03:26:57.007
just sort of clean this blade

03:26:57.007 --> 03:26:59.257
so it's nice and shiny again.

03:26:59.257 --> 03:27:01.816
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Power move.

03:27:01.816 --> 03:27:04.299
TALIESIN: You're going to go full Gollum on us.
MATT: Which as a-- yeah.

03:27:04.299 --> 03:27:07.549
I'll send you the details of the curse in a little bit.

03:27:07.549 --> 03:27:08.418
TRAVIS: "The curse."

03:27:08.418 --> 03:27:10.156
LAURA: Can you guys make us, like,

03:27:10.156 --> 03:27:12.536
travel even faster through the snow?

03:27:12.536 --> 03:27:13.626
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:27:13.626 --> 03:27:15.277
TALIESIN: Like a shortcut?

03:27:15.277 --> 03:27:17.068
MATT: "There's not much in the way of shortcuts here,

03:27:17.068 --> 03:27:20.575
"but we have very keen eyes at what might be coming up on

03:27:20.575 --> 03:27:23.673
"the horizon before they get to your level.

03:27:23.673 --> 03:27:25.773
"And we know a few hiding spots

03:27:25.773 --> 03:27:27.596
"when things get a little hairy."

03:27:27.596 --> 03:27:30.451
TALIESIN: Thank you.
SAM: Little hairy? I see what you did there.

03:27:30.451 --> 03:27:33.660
MATT: (laughs) "Good one, snow."

03:27:33.660 --> 03:27:34.693
"All right."

03:27:34.693 --> 03:27:37.053
(laughter)

03:27:37.053 --> 03:27:39.603
"Well, come on, gather your things, we're going to go."

03:27:40.495 --> 03:27:41.653
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Yay!

03:27:41.653 --> 03:27:44.176
MATT: Dagen looks over and goes,

03:27:44.176 --> 03:27:46.006
"This is real weird."

03:27:46.006 --> 03:27:47.376
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:27:47.376 --> 03:27:50.318
MATT: "I mean, usually we just pass
and put a hand up and don't talk.

03:27:50.318 --> 03:27:52.343
"I haven't had a lot of interaction with

03:27:53.304 --> 03:27:55.154
"the yeti directly, this is...

03:27:56.646 --> 03:27:58.119
"you're weird folk."

03:27:58.119 --> 03:27:59.744
LAURA: Thank you.
MARISHA: Well, maybe this will be

03:27:59.744 --> 03:28:03.969
the start of a bright future between the two of you.

03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:06.193
MATT: "Probably not."

03:28:06.193 --> 03:28:07.896
MARISHA: Nah, probably not.
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:28:07.896 --> 03:28:10.226
MATT: "That's too weird for me."
MARISHA: Yeah, I agree.

03:28:10.226 --> 03:28:12.006
MATT: Continues on.

03:28:12.006 --> 03:28:15.618
You guys progress on for the rest of the day.

03:28:17.446 --> 03:28:20.246
And with the yetis' help,

03:28:20.246 --> 03:28:21.219
we will say,

03:28:22.176 --> 03:28:23.366
for the next day of travel,

03:28:23.366 --> 03:28:25.216
going through a day and night cycle,

03:28:25.216 --> 03:28:28.976
they stay camped outside of the tower-- of your doorway.

03:28:28.976 --> 03:28:31.291
LIAM: I was going to invite them to dinner, actually.

03:28:31.291 --> 03:28:33.371
MARISHA: (gasps)
MATT: And you would-- can you?

03:28:33.371 --> 03:28:36.286
LIAM: I don't think there is a limit of number of people.

03:28:36.286 --> 03:28:39.261
LAURA: Oh no, because I remember
Scanlan fed almost an entire army.

03:28:39.261 --> 03:28:41.458
SAM: Yeah, but can they get in?
TRAVIS: Yeah, but the size.

03:28:41.458 --> 03:28:43.016
MATT: Right.
LIAM: Well, I was going to

03:28:43.016 --> 03:28:45.626
rearrange the stained glass of
the components a little differently

03:28:45.626 --> 03:28:47.676
to make the door just a little bit wider.

03:28:48.806 --> 03:28:50.647
LIAM: If I have to I will--
MATT: I was checking to see if

03:28:50.647 --> 03:28:53.746
there was any size difference or requirements,

03:28:53.746 --> 03:28:56.038
but no, it's any creature you designate.

03:28:56.038 --> 03:28:59.446
So the entryway can shift and adjust.

03:28:59.446 --> 03:29:00.414
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: So, yeah.

03:29:00.414 --> 03:29:03.927
LIAM: The stained glass that I took from the temple,

03:29:03.927 --> 03:29:08.276
I will just widen out the perimeter of the array

03:29:08.276 --> 03:29:10.349
and the door is a little bit bigger.

03:29:10.349 --> 03:29:11.949
Big enough for the big man.

03:29:14.206 --> 03:29:18.226
I am going to invite you into our home.

03:29:18.226 --> 03:29:23.026
And there are certain parts of our home that are off limits.

03:29:23.026 --> 03:29:25.184
But we have lots of food

03:29:25.184 --> 03:29:26.992
and beds for you.

03:29:28.876 --> 03:29:31.276
Would you like to come in?

03:29:31.276 --> 03:29:32.699
MATT: They all look at each other.

03:29:34.583 --> 03:29:35.766
"Certainly."

03:29:36.606 --> 03:29:38.124
LAURA: Oh wait, wait.

03:29:39.606 --> 03:29:40.616
Don't eat the cats.

03:29:40.616 --> 03:29:42.454
TALIESIN: Are you allergic to cats, too?

03:29:42.454 --> 03:29:45.608
SAM: Don't know if they know what a cat is.
LIAM: Do you have cats?

03:29:45.608 --> 03:29:47.563
MATT: "I don't think I have

03:29:47.563 --> 03:29:49.704
"any idea what a cat is."

03:29:49.704 --> 03:29:51.936
LIAM: Okay, well, just follow our lead and

03:29:51.936 --> 03:29:54.697
you know, don't break anything.

03:29:54.697 --> 03:29:56.309
MATT: "All right." Dagen's like,

03:29:56.309 --> 03:29:58.623
"If you see something small and furry,
they're here to help,"

03:29:58.623 --> 03:30:00.443
"not for feeding, got it?"

03:30:00.443 --> 03:30:03.073
(as Gestaf) "Gotcha, all right.

03:30:03.073 --> 03:30:04.669
"This is very weird."

03:30:04.669 --> 03:30:06.063
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:30:06.063 --> 03:30:08.206
MATT: "And I'm a yeti."
TRAVIS: We're fucking--

03:30:08.206 --> 03:30:09.355
we are out there.

03:30:09.355 --> 03:30:13.506
LIAM: Carefully lead them into the tower and--

03:30:15.446 --> 03:30:18.096
Just think "up," and Caleb starts to float.

03:30:18.096 --> 03:30:20.826
MATT: They step in and at first it's like, "Whoa."

03:30:20.826 --> 03:30:22.526
TALIESIN: It's a lot.
MATT: It's a big tower,

03:30:22.526 --> 03:30:24.969
but with all of them in, it's not as big. It's pretty--

03:30:24.969 --> 03:30:27.006
they're still squished in a little bit

03:30:27.006 --> 03:30:28.646
and when they think "up,"

03:30:28.646 --> 03:30:30.454
it takes them a moment to gather what you really mean

03:30:30.454 --> 03:30:31.954
and then when he does, one of them just looks and goes--

03:30:31.954 --> 03:30:33.476
(groaning)

03:30:33.476 --> 03:30:35.686
Just tries doing like the uncontrolled space spin

03:30:35.686 --> 03:30:38.635
and is just losing himself like, "Oh, god!"

03:30:38.635 --> 03:30:41.068
MATT: They grab their friend and try
and pull them back down like a balloon

03:30:41.068 --> 03:30:43.470
and all of a sudden they start going-- (screaming)

03:30:43.470 --> 03:30:46.116
It's just this massive uncontrolled yeti floating.

03:30:46.116 --> 03:30:48.841
LIAM: Everybody come up so they feel at home.

03:30:48.841 --> 03:30:51.316
MATT: Like early fizzy lifting anxiety

03:30:51.316 --> 03:30:52.906
and then eventually they start righting themselves

03:30:52.906 --> 03:30:55.559
and they're going, "Ooh, this is so cool."

03:30:55.559 --> 03:30:57.686
They start pushing off walls.

03:30:57.686 --> 03:30:59.856
TALIESIN: "Weapon of Choice."

03:30:59.856 --> 03:31:01.956
MATT: There's scratch marks on the walls as they're doing it

03:31:01.956 --> 03:31:02.789
but you know, it'll be fine.

03:31:02.789 --> 03:31:04.916
LIAM: That's fine they will just recreate.

03:31:04.916 --> 03:31:09.386
But I'm not taking them past the
second floor or the great hall.

03:31:09.386 --> 03:31:11.326
So there are more floors above,

03:31:11.326 --> 03:31:13.447
but they're not really built out to your specifications,

03:31:13.447 --> 03:31:15.936
so let's just take a rest here.

03:31:15.936 --> 03:31:18.646
And once the rest of the Nein are in, I go to

03:31:18.646 --> 03:31:21.246
the iris that leads to the second floor and say,

03:31:22.613 --> 03:31:24.604
"<i>zu,</i>" and the iris goes (shutting)

03:31:25.656 --> 03:31:28.489
and I do the same up-- no, I leave that open for now.

03:31:28.489 --> 03:31:31.756
And I start going to different
double doors and opening them.

03:31:31.756 --> 03:31:34.496
And there are very large tables on rollers

03:31:34.496 --> 03:31:36.726
and I just start pulling them out into the room

03:31:36.726 --> 03:31:40.946
until there are tables bigger than us

03:31:40.946 --> 03:31:42.506
and tables our size.

03:31:42.506 --> 03:31:45.696
And then I go and I pull a rope

03:31:45.696 --> 03:31:47.626
and a cat comes running down

03:31:47.626 --> 03:31:50.459
one of the little aqueduct tracks and I say:

03:31:50.459 --> 03:31:52.625
Mitzi, we have guests, big guests.

03:31:52.625 --> 03:31:55.313
So I need you to make a very robust meal.

03:31:55.313 --> 03:31:57.693
We probably need-- yesterday was vegetarian.

03:31:57.693 --> 03:32:00.153
We are going to need a lot of meat, so I would like ribs,

03:32:00.153 --> 03:32:02.933
big ribs, like mammoth-size ribs, okay?

03:32:02.933 --> 03:32:05.478
Barbecue sauce, all of that.

03:32:05.478 --> 03:32:07.813
But we'll also have the mac and cheese from yesterday,

03:32:07.813 --> 03:32:09.726
as well as the waffles and the pancakes.

03:32:09.726 --> 03:32:11.360
MARISHA: It was good. Yeah.
TALIESIN: They may want ale.

03:32:11.360 --> 03:32:14.030
LIAM: Double amounts and some ale, yeah. Good call.

03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:15.946
MATT: (grumpy meowing)

03:32:15.946 --> 03:32:17.038
LAURA: Travis.

03:32:17.038 --> 03:32:18.706
(laughter)

03:32:18.706 --> 03:32:21.176
TALIESIN: We broke him. Yay!

03:32:21.176 --> 03:32:22.446
It's all I want in life.

03:32:22.446 --> 03:32:24.992
TRAVIS: The necrotic stone, we can't leave it alone.

03:32:24.992 --> 03:32:27.312
The yetis, we invite them to fucking dinner.

03:32:27.312 --> 03:32:29.430
(laughter)

03:32:29.430 --> 03:32:30.801
MATT: Prime--
MARISHA: It's going to take us--

03:32:30.801 --> 03:32:33.068
MATT: D&amp;D right here.
MARISHA: 10 episodes

03:32:33.068 --> 03:32:35.219
to get to the first excavation site.

03:32:35.219 --> 03:32:36.379
(laughter)

03:32:36.379 --> 03:32:38.926
TALIESIN: Is that the episode, "My Dinner With Yeti"?

03:32:38.926 --> 03:32:43.926
MATT: A fantastical yeti feast, transpires in the tower.

03:32:44.716 --> 03:32:48.056
Strange elements of merriment

03:32:48.056 --> 03:32:52.366
for, just, these creatures adjusting to the

03:32:52.366 --> 03:32:54.656
odd magical space that they've been brought into.

03:32:54.656 --> 03:32:56.466
The meals seems to fill their bellies

03:32:56.466 --> 03:32:57.766
in a very comfortable way.

03:32:59.398 --> 03:33:00.231
Yes?

03:33:00.231 --> 03:33:03.134
LAURA: What's-- can I ask what the big yeti--

03:33:03.134 --> 03:33:06.309
I'll ask all of them, what their names are.

03:33:07.388 --> 03:33:10.583
MATT: The big one goes, "I'm Gestaf."

03:33:10.583 --> 03:33:12.025
MARISHA: Gestaf.

03:33:15.436 --> 03:33:16.660
MATT: And the other is--
LIAM: By the time

03:33:16.660 --> 03:33:17.802
dinner is done, too,

03:33:17.802 --> 03:33:21.496
there are amber spectral cats hanging off of all of them

03:33:21.496 --> 03:33:24.256
doing kitty biscuits on their arms, their shoulders,

03:33:24.256 --> 03:33:25.986
just nestled in.

03:33:25.986 --> 03:33:27.536
MATT: They just freeze when that happens.

03:33:27.536 --> 03:33:29.478
They're just like, "(stammering) Oh."

03:33:30.326 --> 03:33:31.666
MARISHA: Where do you normally sleep?

03:33:31.666 --> 03:33:34.738
Like, what's an average night for you?

03:33:34.738 --> 03:33:39.738
MATT: "Well, we have a bunch of large tents and

03:33:40.443 --> 03:33:45.336
"stretched living spaces made of stone and hides."

03:33:45.336 --> 03:33:46.183
MARISHA: Yeah?

03:33:46.183 --> 03:33:47.016
MATT: "Yeah."

03:33:49.216 --> 03:33:51.499
They all look over to Gestaf who goes like,

03:33:52.586 --> 03:33:56.773
"If you ever find yourselves around or near the Sanctuary,

03:33:56.773 --> 03:33:59.013
"when we're done walking with you,"

03:34:00.497 --> 03:34:03.217
"just say you're a friend of Gestaf's."

03:34:04.923 --> 03:34:07.716
TALIESIN: Appreciate it.
MATT: "And you say it with weapons away."

03:34:07.716 --> 03:34:09.183
SAM: Sure, sure.

03:34:09.183 --> 03:34:10.999
MATT: "Your hospitality is,

03:34:12.033 --> 03:34:15.943
"well, majestic, and I only hope that we can maybe

03:34:15.943 --> 03:34:17.893
"offer the same at some point."

03:34:19.336 --> 03:34:20.169
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:34:21.143 --> 03:34:25.539
Excited to experience your way of life.

03:34:26.640 --> 03:34:28.923
MATT: "A little more rough and tumble, but

03:34:30.043 --> 03:34:31.406
"it gets by."

03:34:31.406 --> 03:34:32.692
MARISHA: Honestly, we're kind of--

03:34:32.692 --> 03:34:35.219
we're new money, you know?

03:34:35.219 --> 03:34:38.539
We're kind of new to this lifestyle.

03:34:39.793 --> 03:34:41.043
TRAVIS: Look at that fucking mini.

03:34:41.043 --> 03:34:42.200
You're standing on its head

03:34:42.200 --> 03:34:44.033
as this conversation is happening.

03:34:44.033 --> 03:34:45.110
(laughter)

03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:46.393
TRAVIS: Look at that fucking face!

03:34:46.393 --> 03:34:49.167
(laughter)

03:34:49.167 --> 03:34:53.283
LIAM: Veth took a necrotic dagger into his heart

03:34:53.283 --> 03:34:54.731
three hours ago.

03:34:54.731 --> 03:34:56.083
MATT: Yep.

03:34:56.083 --> 03:34:57.474
MARISHA: You know--

03:34:57.474 --> 03:34:58.307
TALIESIN: I love this game.

03:34:58.307 --> 03:35:01.054
MATT: Weirdest things happen.
MARISHA: This is humanity.

03:35:01.054 --> 03:35:02.345
This is life, man.

03:35:02.345 --> 03:35:03.523
MATT: (laughs)

03:35:03.523 --> 03:35:05.548
LIAM: While they're talking and the cats

03:35:05.548 --> 03:35:07.461
are pulling the tables

03:35:07.461 --> 03:35:08.436
back to their place,

03:35:08.436 --> 03:35:10.516
Caleb goes over to another set of double doors,

03:35:10.516 --> 03:35:12.846
walks in, and using Telekinesis,

03:35:12.846 --> 03:35:14.636
pulls a cable or a rope out

03:35:14.636 --> 03:35:16.926
and walks all the way across the hallway

03:35:16.926 --> 03:35:20.456
and opens another double doors and connects it in there.

03:35:20.456 --> 03:35:22.146
And then he opens another set of double doors

03:35:22.146 --> 03:35:25.726
and giant white silk tarps are taken out

03:35:25.726 --> 03:35:29.896
and he uses Telekinesis to pull those tarps up over the rope

03:35:29.896 --> 03:35:31.516
and make white--

03:35:31.516 --> 03:35:33.166
beautiful white tents

03:35:34.136 --> 03:35:35.396
on this floor.

03:35:35.396 --> 03:35:39.919
And cats drag out sort of like sleeping bed rolls

03:35:39.919 --> 03:35:41.936
because I don't want to be too different

03:35:41.936 --> 03:35:42.944
than what they're used to.

03:35:42.944 --> 03:35:45.896
To be pulled under the tent for them to sleep in.

03:35:45.896 --> 03:35:46.729
They have a bedroom.

03:35:46.729 --> 03:35:49.046
MATT: That's awesome. That's arranged in the open space.

03:35:49.046 --> 03:35:50.737
They all quickly pick out their spaces

03:35:50.737 --> 03:35:53.076
and lay claim to it.
TALIESIN: Pillow fort!

03:35:53.076 --> 03:35:55.367
MATT: As soon as you finish, Gestaf goes,

03:35:57.717 --> 03:35:59.393
"I thank you for--

03:35:59.393 --> 03:36:03.953
"well, on all our behalfs, for both listening to reason

03:36:03.953 --> 03:36:07.729
"in a moment of tension, and for being kinder than

03:36:08.593 --> 03:36:11.189
"most folks who wander through here are, so

03:36:12.143 --> 03:36:13.206
"thank you."

03:36:13.206 --> 03:36:14.316
LIAM: It's a rough world,

03:36:14.316 --> 03:36:17.483
but when you can find moments of commonality...

03:36:17.483 --> 03:36:19.068
MATT: "Indeed."

03:36:19.068 --> 03:36:20.982
Wipes a large chunk of meat from the side of his mouth,

03:36:20.982 --> 03:36:22.186
that's been there for 20 minutes

03:36:22.186 --> 03:36:24.086
but you haven't been able to point it out, goes (slamming)

03:36:24.086 --> 03:36:24.936
on the ground.

03:36:24.936 --> 03:36:27.606
It weighs about a half of your body weight, Caleb,

03:36:27.606 --> 03:36:29.573
and you step back as it impacts.

03:36:29.573 --> 03:36:30.563
"Oh, sorry."

03:36:31.904 --> 03:36:34.734
LIAM: Quite all right. (nervous chuckle)

03:36:34.734 --> 03:36:35.953
MATT: "Anyway,"

03:36:35.953 --> 03:36:37.773
"let's pick up our journey tomorrow."

03:36:37.773 --> 03:36:40.646
"See how far we get before we have to diverge."

03:36:40.646 --> 03:36:44.295
SAM: If you need it, Caleb can read you a bedtime story.

03:36:44.295 --> 03:36:46.474
(laughter)

03:36:46.474 --> 03:36:47.756
MATT: The one,

03:36:47.756 --> 03:36:49.716
and it's really the smallest of the yeti,

03:36:49.716 --> 03:36:52.994
the one that had the notebook, goes, "Really?"

03:36:52.994 --> 03:36:55.244
(laughter)

03:36:56.556 --> 03:37:00.106
LIAM: Yeah, I have a copy of <i>Der Zauberlehrling</i>.

03:37:00.106 --> 03:37:01.446
It is all in Zemnian,

03:37:03.014 --> 03:37:04.488
but it is very old Zemnian

03:37:04.488 --> 03:37:06.496
and it's hard to translate. So--

03:37:06.496 --> 03:37:09.096
and he just starts reading it in its Zemnian.

03:37:09.096 --> 03:37:12.296
MATT: Within five minutes they're asleep,

03:37:12.296 --> 03:37:14.666
soundly and comfortably,

03:37:14.666 --> 03:37:18.536
and the inner halls of Caleb's arcane tower

03:37:18.536 --> 03:37:23.536
now reverberate with a chorus of discordant snores

03:37:24.026 --> 03:37:27.026
that just vibrate the air.

03:37:27.026 --> 03:37:28.626
The actual glass of the windows

03:37:28.626 --> 03:37:31.516
sometimes seems to resonate with it at time.

03:37:31.516 --> 03:37:32.786
It's a very unique sound.

03:37:32.786 --> 03:37:34.126
It's weirdly

03:37:35.026 --> 03:37:38.066
beautiful in its primal music,

03:37:38.066 --> 03:37:39.716
but

03:37:39.716 --> 03:37:42.126
in your chambers, thankfully, the noise is blocked.

03:37:42.126 --> 03:37:45.380
But you all have a restful evening in the tower

03:37:45.380 --> 03:37:47.692
unless there's anything else?
LAURA: Drowned out by kitty purrs anyway.

03:37:47.692 --> 03:37:48.756
MATT: There you go.

03:37:48.756 --> 03:37:50.211
Unless there's anything else you wish to accomplish

03:37:50.211 --> 03:37:51.176
before the night is over,

03:37:51.176 --> 03:37:52.859
you all rest well on the tower.

03:37:53.926 --> 03:37:56.456
MATT: In the morning, you set out for your--

03:37:56.456 --> 03:37:57.964
this would be

03:37:59.166 --> 03:37:59.999
third?

03:37:59.999 --> 03:38:02.736
This will be your fourth day of journey,

03:38:02.736 --> 03:38:04.546
which you do not have to roll on the table

03:38:04.546 --> 03:38:06.716
because you are being escorted by the yetis.

03:38:06.716 --> 03:38:07.936
LAURA: Oh, tight!

03:38:07.936 --> 03:38:12.716
MATT: So it is an auto clear, non-problematic day,

03:38:12.716 --> 03:38:14.516
and you guys make your way

03:38:14.516 --> 03:38:17.816
around the bend of the mountain range

03:38:17.816 --> 03:38:19.116
on the northern side.

03:38:19.116 --> 03:38:20.716
MARISHA: (vocalizing)

03:38:20.716 --> 03:38:22.636
MATT: As you get towards the end of the day,

03:38:22.636 --> 03:38:24.006
you guys have to continue heading

03:38:24.006 --> 03:38:26.726
in a curved southwestern direction

03:38:26.726 --> 03:38:28.926
while the yeti return towards their sanctuary

03:38:28.926 --> 03:38:29.759
to the northwest.

03:38:29.759 --> 03:38:32.136
So there is a moment where you part

03:38:32.136 --> 03:38:33.826
and you see as they gather their things,

03:38:33.826 --> 03:38:36.653
the yeti look over and Gestaf goes,

03:38:36.653 --> 03:38:39.823
"Thank you again, Mighty...

03:38:39.823 --> 03:38:40.996
"Nein?"

03:38:40.996 --> 03:38:42.287
TALIESIN: We know.
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

03:38:42.287 --> 03:38:43.495
MATT: "Right.

03:38:43.495 --> 03:38:47.844
"Thank you and stay safe."

03:38:47.844 --> 03:38:49.896
SAM: (laughs)

03:38:49.896 --> 03:38:53.106
MATT: Steps forward and you hug his shin.

03:38:53.106 --> 03:38:53.964
Pats your back.

03:38:53.964 --> 03:38:55.405
MATT: "Aww.

03:38:57.823 --> 03:38:59.993
"All right, come on.

03:39:01.313 --> 03:39:04.356
"Hopefully, we'll get back in time for dinner."

03:39:04.356 --> 03:39:05.816
And they all begin to trek their way

03:39:05.816 --> 03:39:07.966
and as you make your way southward,

03:39:09.826 --> 03:39:11.356
the cold gray sky

03:39:11.356 --> 03:39:15.906
getting slightly more dense with the coming light snow.

03:39:15.906 --> 03:39:19.096
You watch as the yeti step off, slowly vanishing over

03:39:19.096 --> 03:39:21.716
the horizon in the direction of the Sanctuary.

03:39:21.716 --> 03:39:24.083
LIAM: They might be too far away,
but Caleb remembers and says:

03:39:24.083 --> 03:39:25.753
Remember,

03:39:25.753 --> 03:39:29.306
only one boba a day!

03:39:32.376 --> 03:39:33.874
MATT: Yeah, they are. They didn't hear that.

03:39:33.874 --> 03:39:34.956
LAURA: (laughs)

03:39:34.956 --> 03:39:35.959
MATT: Not from that distance.

03:39:35.959 --> 03:39:37.225
SAM: Oh well.

03:39:37.225 --> 03:39:38.946
They'll all die.

03:39:38.946 --> 03:39:42.436
MATT: But another night journeyed.

03:39:42.436 --> 03:39:44.639
Let's roll one more time for your final day.

03:39:44.639 --> 03:39:46.707
SAM: It's Taliesin's turn.
LIAM: Tally-ally-ally-al.

03:39:46.707 --> 03:39:48.620
LAURA: Taliesin!
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I've been doing great.

03:39:48.620 --> 03:39:49.495
LIAM: Nat one.

03:39:50.376 --> 03:39:51.443
TALIESIN: Number 18.

03:39:51.443 --> 03:39:52.746
LAURA: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Lucky number 18.

03:39:52.746 --> 03:39:54.800
MATT: 18. All righty.
SAM: Seems good.

03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:55.986
TALIESIN: Who knows.

03:39:55.986 --> 03:39:57.376
MATT: The weather is clear.

03:39:57.376 --> 03:40:00.359
And despite the wind and the snowfall,

03:40:01.656 --> 03:40:03.657
you are allowed safe passage through.

03:40:03.657 --> 03:40:04.840
ALL: Yes.

03:40:04.840 --> 03:40:05.673
TRAVIS: Nice.

03:40:05.673 --> 03:40:10.139
MATT: And as you press on towards
this final day of the journey,

03:40:11.036 --> 03:40:14.629
you begin to approach the location
marked on your map as A-5.

03:40:16.146 --> 03:40:20.196
The terrain begins to shift from the hilly white horizon

03:40:20.196 --> 03:40:22.656
to a more snow-covered rocky region

03:40:22.656 --> 03:40:25.676
that marks the approach of the nearby mountain range

03:40:25.676 --> 03:40:29.389
and the broken ground that surrounds this section.

03:40:30.526 --> 03:40:33.226
Odd broken monoliths of stone jut from the ice,

03:40:33.226 --> 03:40:36.749
like something angry punched from beneath the ground.

03:40:39.516 --> 03:40:40.449
At this point,

03:40:42.006 --> 03:40:44.534
a voice creeps into your mind, Jester.

03:40:46.906 --> 03:40:48.646
It's odd and at first you don't recognize it

03:40:48.646 --> 03:40:50.909
because it sounds like two voices at once.

03:40:52.026 --> 03:40:53.166
(as Cree) One of them

03:40:53.166 --> 03:40:54.957
has this sort of sound

03:40:55.899 --> 03:40:57.474
and you recognize it as

03:40:57.474 --> 03:40:59.146
Cree's.
MARISHA: Cree.

03:40:59.146 --> 03:41:01.986
MATT: (Irish accent) Then over that
is another familiar voice

03:41:01.986 --> 03:41:03.524
speaking in unison

03:41:05.146 --> 03:41:06.415
saying,

03:41:06.415 --> 03:41:09.543
"Oh, I'm so glad you decided to come."

03:41:10.493 --> 03:41:13.153
"We were somewhat worried I'd scared you off."

03:41:13.153 --> 03:41:15.593
"It would seem curiosity always wins."

03:41:17.526 --> 03:41:19.097
And that's all you hear.

03:41:19.983 --> 03:41:21.726
You can respond if you'd like.

03:41:24.656 --> 03:41:26.631
LAURA: (terrified whisper) Are you pooping?

03:41:28.082 --> 03:41:30.326
No, that's not-- (laughs)

03:41:30.326 --> 03:41:32.839
MATT: It was the drama behind it that made it.

03:41:33.906 --> 03:41:34.836
LIAM: Sold it, you sold it.

03:41:34.836 --> 03:41:36.926
MARISHA: I would really so here for it.

03:41:36.926 --> 03:41:38.301
MATT: (laughs)

03:41:40.106 --> 03:41:41.946
LAURA: Fuck it, that is what I say.

03:41:41.946 --> 03:41:42.779
MARISHA: Do it.

03:41:42.779 --> 03:41:44.516
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Own it.

03:41:44.516 --> 03:41:46.282
There is no further response.

03:41:49.283 --> 03:41:51.866
LAURA: (panting breaths)

03:41:51.866 --> 03:41:53.684
Molly just talked to me.

03:41:53.684 --> 03:41:54.868
MARISHA: What?
TALIESIN: What do you mean?

03:41:54.868 --> 03:41:56.926
LAURA: Molly just talked to me.

03:41:56.926 --> 03:41:58.276
LIAM: And said?

03:41:59.186 --> 03:42:00.672
LAURA: They're waiting for us.

03:42:01.581 --> 03:42:03.206
SAM: Did they say where?

03:42:03.206 --> 03:42:04.926
LAURA: I think they're here.

03:42:04.926 --> 03:42:05.936
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: But,

03:42:05.936 --> 03:42:07.106
it wasn't just him.

03:42:07.106 --> 03:42:09.279
It was Cree, too, I think.

03:42:10.536 --> 03:42:11.986
LIAM: And three more?

03:42:11.986 --> 03:42:14.216
LAURA: I just heard two voices.

03:42:14.216 --> 03:42:15.096
LIAM: Well.

03:42:15.096 --> 03:42:17.286
SAM: And Cree talked to you as well?

03:42:17.286 --> 03:42:20.226
LAURA: Yeah, at the same time. What does that mean?

03:42:20.226 --> 03:42:23.476
SAM: They've got special powers, maybe?

03:42:23.476 --> 03:42:25.289
LAURA: Are they all one person?

03:42:25.289 --> 03:42:28.122
SAM: (gasps) Ooh.
MARISHA: Hive mind?

03:42:30.116 --> 03:42:32.096
LIAM: Interesting.

03:42:32.096 --> 03:42:33.696
SAM: Interesting.

03:42:33.696 --> 03:42:35.536
MARISHA: Or they're just

03:42:35.536 --> 03:42:37.286
operating on a

03:42:37.286 --> 03:42:40.436
much weirder and larger level than we've even considered.

03:42:40.436 --> 03:42:42.126
SAM: Do we have an orb near us right now?

03:42:42.126 --> 03:42:43.806
How do they know we're here?

03:42:43.806 --> 03:42:48.146
TRAVIS: I'll cast See Invisibility
again with the sword summoned.

03:42:48.146 --> 03:42:49.326
MATT: Okay.

03:42:49.326 --> 03:42:52.616
You glance and, roughly about a foot above Jester's head,

03:42:52.616 --> 03:42:57.466
you see a slightly faint shimmering beacon of arcane--

03:42:57.466 --> 03:42:59.216
TRAVIS: Oh yes,

03:42:59.216 --> 03:43:03.076
they seem to be locked on you again.

03:43:03.076 --> 03:43:04.059
LAURA: Dispel.

03:43:05.216 --> 03:43:06.049
MATT: Okay.

03:43:07.866 --> 03:43:12.089
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

03:43:13.426 --> 03:43:14.259
SAM: Two.

03:43:15.838 --> 03:43:18.056
LAURA: I've got a good wisdom, bitch.

03:43:18.976 --> 03:43:22.166
I've got a plus five to my wisdom, thank you very much.

03:43:22.166 --> 03:43:23.372
LIAM: (funny voice) I'm a cleric.

03:43:23.372 --> 03:43:25.337
LAURA: (funny voice) I'm a cleric.

03:43:25.337 --> 03:43:26.973
That's, um...

03:43:26.973 --> 03:43:28.565
13.

03:43:28.565 --> 03:43:29.398
MATT: 13.

03:43:29.398 --> 03:43:31.056
LAURA: I rolled super good.

03:43:31.056 --> 03:43:32.346
MATT: Sorry.

03:43:32.346 --> 03:43:34.896
Unfortunately, it does not vanish.

03:43:34.896 --> 03:43:35.729
LAURA: (frustrated grunt)

03:43:35.729 --> 03:43:38.116
SAM: Say some false information.

03:43:38.116 --> 03:43:39.856
LAURA: Oh, I guess I wouldn't know that it's not vanished.

03:43:39.856 --> 03:43:41.716
Is it gone?

03:43:41.716 --> 03:43:43.446
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:43:43.446 --> 03:43:44.378
LAURA: Oh, good.
TRAVIS: You got it.

03:43:44.378 --> 03:43:46.869
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I'm so good at this!

03:43:50.196 --> 03:43:51.029
Anyway.

03:43:51.886 --> 03:43:53.236
Yeah, they know we're here.

03:43:54.156 --> 03:43:55.186
MARISHA: Assholes.

03:43:59.416 --> 03:44:02.089
SAM: Where are we? I mean it's nighttime, daytime?

03:44:02.943 --> 03:44:06.076
MATT: It's-- this final day's travel before you reach here.

03:44:06.076 --> 03:44:07.866
You'd get here late afternoon.

03:44:07.866 --> 03:44:09.976
You have about an hour and a half until dusk

03:44:09.976 --> 03:44:12.816
and you're still not entirely-- you just see like

03:44:12.816 --> 03:44:14.416
for the somewhat hilly snowy landscape

03:44:14.416 --> 03:44:15.476
you've been traveling with,

03:44:15.476 --> 03:44:17.996
you know, variations in height.

03:44:17.996 --> 03:44:20.756
It's been mostly, fairly easy to traverse.

03:44:20.756 --> 03:44:22.966
Just skirting around the heavy mountain range

03:44:22.966 --> 03:44:24.316
and as you went around to this side,

03:44:24.316 --> 03:44:26.996
to this pocket-- this portion of the valley where

03:44:26.996 --> 03:44:30.036
this is marked on the map, the ground is much more broken

03:44:30.036 --> 03:44:32.496
and there are pieces of jagged stone that seem

03:44:32.496 --> 03:44:34.166
to punch through from the ground beneath.

03:44:34.166 --> 03:44:36.291
There are heavy valleys at some points,

03:44:36.291 --> 03:44:38.957
sometimes wide, sometimes very small,

03:44:38.957 --> 03:44:40.646
but it is a very broken landscape

03:44:40.646 --> 03:44:42.690
in comparison to where you've been.

03:44:42.690 --> 03:44:43.998
SAM: How do we find,

03:44:45.136 --> 03:44:49.536
like, a way in or down or through?

03:44:49.536 --> 03:44:51.589
Dagen, have you been here?

03:44:52.573 --> 03:44:53.443
MATT: "I've--

03:44:54.793 --> 03:44:58.218
"I've helped folks find their way around here, I just--

03:45:00.293 --> 03:45:02.143
"Finding a space always takes a little bit.

03:45:02.143 --> 03:45:04.686
"Hold on. Follow me."

03:45:04.686 --> 03:45:05.856
And he begins to

03:45:05.856 --> 03:45:08.986
carry you guys through the broken spaces here.

03:45:08.986 --> 03:45:12.986
You can see it's-- areas are almost like pits,

03:45:12.986 --> 03:45:14.427
where parts of the ground almost had

03:45:14.427 --> 03:45:16.766
small localized sinkholes and

03:45:16.766 --> 03:45:20.096
where the snow is built up. There's a sense of, like,

03:45:20.096 --> 03:45:22.296
you're not sure if that's going to be actually solid ground

03:45:22.296 --> 03:45:25.306
or just a pit that's filled in with snow temporarily.

03:45:25.306 --> 03:45:28.176
And you precariously follow in Dagen's tracks

03:45:28.176 --> 03:45:29.935
as he's--
TRAVIS: Just a moment.

03:45:29.935 --> 03:45:32.766
Just so we don't do the work for them again.

03:45:32.766 --> 03:45:34.299
Is that sphere gone yet?

03:45:36.028 --> 03:45:39.189
MATT: Yeah, it does not last the entire
length of your See Invisibility.

03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:42.606
TRAVIS: Just making sure we're not showing them the way in.

03:45:42.606 --> 03:45:44.498
MARISHA: Yeah, like we did with Obann?

03:45:46.346 --> 03:45:48.586
LAURA: They could be watching us right now.

03:45:48.586 --> 03:45:50.786
Not through a scry.

03:45:50.786 --> 03:45:53.626
SAM: Or like it's just from a--

03:45:53.626 --> 03:45:55.606
from a rock somewhere?

03:45:55.606 --> 03:45:58.016
TRAVIS: Anyone see anything, want to sweep the horizons,

03:45:58.016 --> 03:46:00.116
do a perception check?

03:46:00.116 --> 03:46:03.851
Any ledges or embankments or anything?

03:46:04.686 --> 03:46:06.816
MARISHA: I can do a scan.

03:46:08.409 --> 03:46:10.008
I'll try one.

03:46:13.073 --> 03:46:14.436
LAURA: 16.

03:46:14.436 --> 03:46:15.796
TALIESIN: What'd you roll?

03:46:15.796 --> 03:46:17.067
MARISHA: Seven.

03:46:17.067 --> 03:46:20.744
TALIESIN: I rolled a natural one,
which brings it to 11, but...

03:46:20.744 --> 03:46:21.993
MATT: Yeah, but it's still natural one.

03:46:21.993 --> 03:46:23.517
LAURA: 16.
MATT: 16? Okay.

03:46:23.517 --> 03:46:27.082
Glancing around the vicinity. Nothing catches your eye.

03:46:28.966 --> 03:46:31.286
You just see a bunch of ice gathered in areas where

03:46:31.286 --> 03:46:32.526
the rock seems to

03:46:32.526 --> 03:46:34.186
come off at an odd angle.

03:46:34.186 --> 03:46:38.566
You can see the lengthy icicles and bits of jagged ice

03:46:38.566 --> 03:46:41.466
that has gathered around some of the embankments and bases.

03:46:42.511 --> 03:46:46.671
And it's an oddly alien landscape within an alien landscape.

03:46:49.316 --> 03:46:51.206
ASHLEY: Is it at all like the

03:46:51.206 --> 03:46:53.176
Barbed Fields type of thing?

03:46:53.176 --> 03:46:54.286
MATT: Nowhere near that tall

03:46:54.286 --> 03:46:57.396
and it's more just like very varied in broken ground.

03:46:57.396 --> 03:46:59.876
The Barbed Fields was these massive spires--

03:46:59.876 --> 03:47:03.956
these weird angled, sometimes hooked spires that

03:47:03.956 --> 03:47:05.159
defied logic.

03:47:06.806 --> 03:47:08.896
But as Dagen leads you through,

03:47:08.896 --> 03:47:10.751
it takes about an hour or so and the light in

03:47:10.751 --> 03:47:13.496
the sky begins to get somewhat darker before eventually,

03:47:13.496 --> 03:47:14.913
he goes,

03:47:14.913 --> 03:47:16.323
"All right,

03:47:16.323 --> 03:47:18.223
"this is all looking mighty familiar.

03:47:19.383 --> 03:47:21.049
"It's got to be

03:47:22.313 --> 03:47:23.608
"there."

03:47:23.608 --> 03:47:24.599
And he points over.

03:47:25.856 --> 03:47:26.826
And you can see

03:47:27.676 --> 03:47:29.066
a jagged ice shelf

03:47:29.066 --> 03:47:32.376
that arches over the mouth of a lightless cavern

03:47:32.376 --> 03:47:35.453
that descends into darkness below.

03:47:35.453 --> 03:47:39.069
It would be easy to look past this and not even notice it,

03:47:39.069 --> 03:47:41.686
but once Dagen points it out, it's hard to not see it

03:47:41.686 --> 03:47:43.776
amongst all the

03:47:43.776 --> 03:47:45.156
somewhat

03:47:45.156 --> 03:47:46.706
rough and jagged terrain.

03:47:46.706 --> 03:47:49.446
There is definitively a cave mouth there

03:47:49.446 --> 03:47:51.629
and once you-- once you're noticing it,

03:47:52.996 --> 03:47:56.462
the presence, for some reason, shakes you a bit.

03:47:57.866 --> 03:47:59.096
This is--

03:47:59.096 --> 03:48:02.071
this is the excavation site that you've been seeking.

03:48:02.976 --> 03:48:04.949
TALIESIN: Are there footprints leading into it?

03:48:04.949 --> 03:48:06.282
Just like people have already--

03:48:06.282 --> 03:48:08.553
MATT: Who wants to make an investigation
check to look, you can.

03:48:10.436 --> 03:48:13.629
TALIESIN: (raspberry) I mean, it's investigation.
I don't know why I bother.

03:48:14.826 --> 03:48:17.206
That's a three minus one, so that's a two.

03:48:17.206 --> 03:48:18.394
MATT: Okay.

03:48:18.394 --> 03:48:19.227
LIAM: I'm going to--
MARISHA: Yeah, any--

03:48:19.227 --> 03:48:20.227
TALIESIN: Snow
MARISHA: -- any sign

03:48:20.227 --> 03:48:24.445
of camping, campfires, anything?

03:48:24.445 --> 03:48:25.616
MATT: I'd say

03:48:25.616 --> 03:48:27.046
investigation or survival,

03:48:27.046 --> 03:48:28.916
either way, if you want to check.

03:48:28.916 --> 03:48:30.616
What would have been your survival roll on that?

03:48:30.616 --> 03:48:32.446
TALIESIN: Oh way higher, that would have been eight with--

03:48:32.446 --> 03:48:33.279
MATT: Still not enough.

03:48:33.279 --> 03:48:34.686
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:48:34.686 --> 03:48:36.352
I rolled real bad.
MARISHA: 28.

03:48:36.352 --> 03:48:37.784
MATT: 28? Okay.

03:48:39.516 --> 03:48:40.619
What you do find--

03:48:41.746 --> 03:48:44.336
there are numerous frozen corpses

03:48:44.336 --> 03:48:47.036
dragged from the excavation site

03:48:47.036 --> 03:48:48.106
that have been

03:48:48.106 --> 03:48:52.146
thrown down into certain areas of the surrounding ravine

03:48:52.146 --> 03:48:56.051
that are just currently covered in frost and ice.

03:48:58.476 --> 03:49:00.376
Glancing down at the spaces.

03:49:00.376 --> 03:49:01.736
There's enough snow on them

03:49:01.736 --> 03:49:04.296
where it looks like they've been there for a while.

03:49:04.296 --> 03:49:05.286
MARISHA: Not yesterday?

03:49:05.286 --> 03:49:06.866
MATT: Not yesterday.

03:49:06.866 --> 03:49:08.009
You do find

03:49:09.066 --> 03:49:12.616
fresher footprints leading towards the entryway.

03:49:12.616 --> 03:49:15.449
I mean, there are numerous signs of footprints.

03:49:16.846 --> 03:49:19.076
Some appear to be much older

03:49:19.076 --> 03:49:22.809
and you only catch elements of them that are left under

03:49:22.809 --> 03:49:24.416
overhangs as you make your way around

03:49:24.416 --> 03:49:26.586
where a majority of the harsher weather

03:49:26.586 --> 03:49:29.026
didn't quite cover their presence.

03:49:29.026 --> 03:49:31.546
But you do see fresher sets of footprints,

03:49:31.546 --> 03:49:33.586
a number of them that

03:49:33.586 --> 03:49:35.836
have made their way to that opening

03:49:35.836 --> 03:49:38.576
probably in the past 24 hours or so.

03:49:38.576 --> 03:49:40.709
LIAM: These bodies, do they look like

03:49:40.709 --> 03:49:42.533
the rough and tumble dangerous type

03:49:42.533 --> 03:49:44.413
or workers?

03:49:44.413 --> 03:49:46.038
MATT: Well, a little bit of both.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:49:46.038 --> 03:49:47.843
MATT: Some, it's hard to tell--

03:49:47.843 --> 03:49:50.456
you gather and you-- I'd say you find, with that roll,

03:49:50.456 --> 03:49:51.696
five different bodies

03:49:51.696 --> 03:49:52.636
just looking around.

03:49:52.636 --> 03:49:53.846
Some that are mostly buried

03:49:53.846 --> 03:49:56.266
and you wipe off the area and find them.

03:49:56.266 --> 03:49:58.146
You see one that's most of a person.

03:49:58.146 --> 03:50:00.194
They all appear to have been

03:50:01.116 --> 03:50:02.236
cut.

03:50:02.236 --> 03:50:04.528
Like they've all been gashed to death.

03:50:04.528 --> 03:50:05.759
Some sort of

03:50:07.096 --> 03:50:10.168
battle or assault ended their life.

03:50:11.132 --> 03:50:12.058
MARISHA: Gashed.

03:50:12.058 --> 03:50:13.182
MATT: You see

03:50:13.182 --> 03:50:15.358
one of them appears to be

03:50:15.358 --> 03:50:16.845
a goblin.

03:50:19.186 --> 03:50:22.926
You see two that are standard humans.

03:50:22.926 --> 03:50:24.996
One of them looks relatively--

03:50:24.996 --> 03:50:26.696
what you'd expect from somebody

03:50:26.696 --> 03:50:28.046
who works out of Balenpost.

03:50:31.116 --> 03:50:32.666
You see one looks a little more

03:50:36.236 --> 03:50:38.046
almost

03:50:38.046 --> 03:50:40.476
merchant in the way their clothing is presented,

03:50:40.476 --> 03:50:42.466
though they're wearing a heavy cloak over it,

03:50:42.466 --> 03:50:44.556
but their whole front of their torso is just stained red

03:50:44.556 --> 03:50:48.376
and they are frozen in a layer of thick ice and snow.

03:50:48.376 --> 03:50:51.216
TRAVIS: Any items on these people, magical items, weapons,

03:50:51.216 --> 03:50:52.846
anything like that?

03:50:52.846 --> 03:50:54.626
MATT: You can check.

03:50:54.626 --> 03:50:56.092
Make an investigation.
LIAM: I'll cast Detect Magic,

03:50:56.092 --> 03:50:57.613
hearing Fjord say that.

03:50:57.613 --> 03:50:58.446
MATT: Okay.

03:51:01.026 --> 03:51:02.709
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17, good call.

03:51:04.316 --> 03:51:05.906
A lot of these bodies, you'd have--

03:51:05.906 --> 03:51:08.376
or I'd say some of them you'd have to warm up a bit

03:51:08.376 --> 03:51:09.906
to try and get through the ice that has gathered upon them

03:51:09.906 --> 03:51:12.306
over time. They've been here for quite a while.

03:51:12.306 --> 03:51:13.926
Nothing magical catches your attention,

03:51:13.926 --> 03:51:15.436
and looking at most of the bodies,

03:51:15.436 --> 03:51:17.536
aside from what they're wearing

03:51:17.536 --> 03:51:21.366
and some simple, basic daggers, shortswords,

03:51:21.366 --> 03:51:23.999
one of them has like a short bow over their back,

03:51:24.836 --> 03:51:27.226
all their money, all their belongings have been taken.

03:51:27.226 --> 03:51:29.036
Two of them don't even have boots.

03:51:29.036 --> 03:51:30.996
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: Looks like whoever killed them,

03:51:30.996 --> 03:51:32.648
robbed whatever seemed to be of worth.

03:51:32.648 --> 03:51:34.514
TRAVIS: Who the fuck takes boots?

03:51:34.514 --> 03:51:37.206
SAM: And this opening down into below,

03:51:37.206 --> 03:51:38.326
is it big?

03:51:38.326 --> 03:51:40.841
Is it like a little mineshaft? What are we talking?

03:51:40.841 --> 03:51:44.416
MATT: It's about, maybe,
12 feet across from side to side

03:51:44.416 --> 03:51:46.556
and no taller than eight feet.

03:51:46.556 --> 03:51:47.731
SAM: I'll check it for traps.

03:51:47.731 --> 03:51:49.331
TRAVIS: Three people wide.
MATT: Go for it.

03:51:49.331 --> 03:51:50.883
MARISHA: Do I see any markings?

03:51:50.883 --> 03:51:51.856
Any signs?

03:51:51.856 --> 03:51:54.772
Any language,

03:51:54.772 --> 03:51:56.406
carvings on the wall that looks like

03:51:56.406 --> 03:51:58.256
it's signifying anything?

03:51:58.256 --> 03:51:59.672
MATT: No.
LIAM: There's just nature at this point.

03:51:59.672 --> 03:52:01.246
MATT: It's just nature.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:52:01.246 --> 03:52:02.706
SAM: 27.

03:52:02.706 --> 03:52:03.539
MATT: 27?

03:52:04.636 --> 03:52:05.940
No traps.
SAM: Great.

03:52:05.940 --> 03:52:08.046
MATT: But as you get closer and falling behind

03:52:08.046 --> 03:52:10.286
Nott as Nott signifies that it's not trapped,

03:52:10.286 --> 03:52:11.646
you do notice that at the edges

03:52:11.646 --> 03:52:13.366
of the stone of the entrance,

03:52:13.366 --> 03:52:15.686
where some of the ice itself

03:52:15.686 --> 03:52:18.866
comes in and seems to be facing in the direction

03:52:18.866 --> 03:52:19.786
of the opening,

03:52:19.786 --> 03:52:22.796
you can see elements of the stone are

03:52:22.796 --> 03:52:24.636
carved or at least have

03:52:24.636 --> 03:52:27.316
markings like they've been chiseled and broken.

03:52:27.316 --> 03:52:29.696
And the ice itself at this place,

03:52:29.696 --> 03:52:32.446
while there are fresher icicles that fall from it,

03:52:32.446 --> 03:52:34.879
you see the signs that this has been worked.

03:52:34.879 --> 03:52:35.712
This has been--

03:52:38.756 --> 03:52:41.459
You gather because what you do as an investigator,

03:52:42.776 --> 03:52:45.099
that this cavern has been uncovered.

03:52:46.156 --> 03:52:49.226
MARISHA: Not natural necessarily, but--

03:52:49.226 --> 03:52:50.826
MATT: Right. I mean, it was,

03:52:50.826 --> 03:52:53.736
the cave itself was natural in its formation

03:52:53.736 --> 03:52:56.676
but it was uncovered by digging and

03:52:56.676 --> 03:52:58.376
removal of ice forcefully

03:52:58.376 --> 03:52:59.209
and

03:53:01.509 --> 03:53:03.246
that's the most you get out of that one.

03:53:03.246 --> 03:53:05.449
LIAM: Well, this is the pits.

03:53:06.776 --> 03:53:08.956
Our adversaries absolutely know we are coming.

03:53:08.956 --> 03:53:10.726
They are absolutely waiting for us.

03:53:10.726 --> 03:53:13.186
They seem to have the ability to look at us

03:53:13.186 --> 03:53:14.296
at any time they want.

03:53:14.296 --> 03:53:16.996
We have no element of surprise.

03:53:16.996 --> 03:53:18.179
This is the pits.

03:53:19.186 --> 03:53:20.019
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:53:22.016 --> 03:53:22.849
Yeah.

03:53:26.106 --> 03:53:28.046
LIAM: The best I can think of is to send my cat in

03:53:28.046 --> 03:53:30.396
and see how long it takes for them to kill him.

03:53:32.066 --> 03:53:35.256
MARISHA: We don't know how far down they are.

03:53:35.256 --> 03:53:36.236
LIAM: Correct.

03:53:36.236 --> 03:53:38.356
TRAVIS: We don't know if they're in there at all.

03:53:38.356 --> 03:53:39.606
MARISHA: They've got to be.

03:53:39.606 --> 03:53:40.876
TALIESIN: Pretty sure they are.

03:53:40.876 --> 03:53:42.346
TRAVIS: Well, remember it was

03:53:42.346 --> 03:53:45.246
to alpha and alpha, which is far further north from here.

03:53:45.246 --> 03:53:48.686
They may have been here yesterday and moved on already.

03:53:48.686 --> 03:53:50.686
MARISHA: Do I see any footprints that look like

03:53:50.686 --> 03:53:53.189
they are leading away from here further north?

03:53:54.546 --> 03:53:56.796
Like they've been here and then they're gone?

03:53:58.646 --> 03:54:00.346
MATT: None of the fresher ones.

03:54:00.346 --> 03:54:02.088
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: None of the fresher ones.

03:54:02.088 --> 03:54:02.962
ASHLEY: Hmm.

03:54:04.004 --> 03:54:05.896
MARISHA: None of the fresher ones
look like they've moved away?

03:54:05.896 --> 03:54:07.266
LIAM: Meaning there's lot's of old stale ones

03:54:07.266 --> 03:54:08.356
going in every direction.

03:54:08.356 --> 03:54:10.081
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: The freshest ones are--

03:54:10.081 --> 03:54:10.914
MARISHA: Inward.

03:54:10.914 --> 03:54:13.283
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Okay.

03:54:13.283 --> 03:54:14.391
I don't know.

03:54:14.391 --> 03:54:15.886
Feels like they're still here.

03:54:17.856 --> 03:54:19.939
So this is an ambush.

03:54:23.266 --> 03:54:25.146
This is an ambush. What are we doing?

03:54:25.146 --> 03:54:25.999
TRAVIS: Five on seven?

03:54:27.106 --> 03:54:28.926
Could be worse.
LAURA: Yeah but

03:54:28.926 --> 03:54:31.984
they're five that killed a really strong--

03:54:31.984 --> 03:54:32.817
MARISHA: (clicks tongue)

03:54:33.686 --> 03:54:35.196
Snuck into her room.

03:54:35.196 --> 03:54:36.754
SAM: We're eight now.
MARISHA: I noticed.

03:54:36.754 --> 03:54:39.026
SAM: Got Dagen with us.

03:54:39.026 --> 03:54:39.859
TRAVIS: Five on eight.

03:54:39.859 --> 03:54:41.304
MATT: "Uh, and I don't mean to--"

03:54:41.304 --> 03:54:42.137
MARISHA: (sneezes)

03:54:42.137 --> 03:54:43.366
MATT: Gesundheit.
LIAM: <i>Gesund</i>.

03:54:43.366 --> 03:54:44.906
MARISHA: Sorry, it snuck up on me.

03:54:44.906 --> 03:54:47.656
MATT: "I just want to be clear. I'm a guide.

03:54:47.656 --> 03:54:49.296
"I get you <i>to</i> the location."

03:54:49.296 --> 03:54:50.329
MARISHA: So eight on seven.

03:54:50.329 --> 03:54:52.256
MATT: "I'm not going down there."

03:54:52.256 --> 03:54:53.236
SAM: Aww.

03:54:53.236 --> 03:54:54.146
LIAM: Makes sense.

03:54:54.146 --> 03:54:55.496
SAM: He's such a cool fighter.
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Five.

03:54:56.456 --> 03:54:57.686
SAM: Well, we'll just be careful.

03:54:57.686 --> 03:54:58.786
We'll send in the cat.

03:55:00.306 --> 03:55:02.236
I'll go invisible and scout ahead.

03:55:02.236 --> 03:55:03.286
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:55:03.286 --> 03:55:04.976
SAM: We'll check our six.

03:55:04.976 --> 03:55:06.666
That's a thing that people do.

03:55:06.666 --> 03:55:08.516
TRAVIS: Actually, your invisible won't work.

03:55:09.776 --> 03:55:10.609
SAM: Why?

03:55:10.609 --> 03:55:11.908
TRAVIS: Well--
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:55:11.908 --> 03:55:14.086
TRAVIS: Molly noticed the scrying orb,

03:55:14.086 --> 03:55:17.021
which I can do only when I See Invisibility.

03:55:18.926 --> 03:55:20.536
They'll see you.

03:55:20.536 --> 03:55:22.016
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: I can still sneak.

03:55:22.016 --> 03:55:22.983
TRAVIS: You can.

03:55:22.983 --> 03:55:25.083
LAURA: Should I try to send a message to Molly?

03:55:26.096 --> 03:55:27.946
SAM: How about you say, "Where are you?"

03:55:29.706 --> 03:55:31.256
or

03:55:31.256 --> 03:55:32.989
"Clap three times."

03:55:34.286 --> 03:55:35.226
LAURA: Yeah.

03:55:35.226 --> 03:55:37.276
I'm going to try to send a message.

03:55:37.276 --> 03:55:38.109
LAURA: Okay.

03:55:48.256 --> 03:55:50.173
Why are you doing this?

03:55:52.887 --> 03:55:56.170
What do you even want from us?

03:55:59.986 --> 03:56:01.806
We just miss you.

03:56:01.806 --> 03:56:04.306
I thought you were our friend.

03:56:11.746 --> 03:56:13.519
Anyway, we're here.

03:56:20.246 --> 03:56:22.056
MATT: The voice returns

03:56:22.056 --> 03:56:24.419
rather rapidly from your statement and says,

03:56:25.343 --> 03:56:26.823
"I don't mean you any harm.

03:56:29.473 --> 03:56:31.003
"I'm just

03:56:31.003 --> 03:56:32.679
"pursuing my interests,

03:56:34.163 --> 03:56:36.213
"and if you have similar interests, well,

03:56:37.643 --> 03:56:40.310
"I'm inviting you to come along.

03:56:43.817 --> 03:56:44.859
"You don't have to."

03:56:50.576 --> 03:56:53.146
LAURA: Does it sound like he's lying? (laughs)

03:56:53.146 --> 03:56:55.156
MATT: (laughs)

03:56:55.156 --> 03:56:56.286
Make an insight check.

03:56:56.286 --> 03:56:57.747
LIAM: Shifty.

03:56:59.267 --> 03:57:01.458
LAURA: Ooh, good. (blows raspberry).

03:57:01.458 --> 03:57:03.134
(laughter)

03:57:03.134 --> 03:57:04.946
LAURA: I rolled a two, so

03:57:04.946 --> 03:57:06.326
seven.

03:57:06.326 --> 03:57:10.126
MATT: Hard to gauge through a message spell, necessarily.

03:57:10.126 --> 03:57:13.036
And you're still a little shook by the interaction.

03:57:13.036 --> 03:57:14.536
Hearing that voice again after so long

03:57:14.536 --> 03:57:16.621
it still rattles you.

03:57:18.666 --> 03:57:21.316
TRAVIS: You never asked him what his name is.

03:57:23.060 --> 03:57:24.886
MARISHA: What if we join him?

03:57:24.886 --> 03:57:26.849
What if we take him up on his offer

03:57:28.296 --> 03:57:30.136
and join him?

03:57:30.136 --> 03:57:33.436
TALIESIN: I don't think deceit's
going to work on this one, but--

03:57:33.436 --> 03:57:35.853
MARISHA: I'm not being deceitful at all.

03:57:37.476 --> 03:57:40.666
TRAVIS: You don't even know what you're joining, though.

03:57:40.666 --> 03:57:41.846
MARISHA: No.

03:57:41.846 --> 03:57:42.679
I don't.

03:57:43.866 --> 03:57:45.926
I didn't know what I was joining though when I got thrust

03:57:45.926 --> 03:57:47.676
into the Cobalt Soul either, though.

03:57:48.786 --> 03:57:49.759
Made it work.

03:57:51.149 --> 03:57:53.096
SAM: What if they're doing evil shit?

03:57:53.096 --> 03:57:53.929
MARISHA: They are.

03:57:53.929 --> 03:57:55.546
SAM: Well, then I don't want to join them.

03:57:55.546 --> 03:57:56.696
MARISHA: Well--

03:57:58.716 --> 03:58:02.396
You join to see what happens and then

03:58:02.396 --> 03:58:05.479
at least we're there when shit goes awry,

03:58:06.659 --> 03:58:08.826
right?
LIAM: This is the pits.

03:58:08.826 --> 03:58:09.659
TALIESIN: Let's be cautious.

03:58:09.659 --> 03:58:13.366
MARISHA: Either we walk in and we get ambushed--

03:58:13.366 --> 03:58:14.516
SAM: We won't get ambushed.

03:58:14.516 --> 03:58:16.046
MARISHA: We will get amb--

03:58:16.046 --> 03:58:16.986
SAM: We won't.

03:58:16.986 --> 03:58:18.286
MARISHA: Why wouldn't we get ambushed?

03:58:18.286 --> 03:58:19.436
SAM: Because we're smarter.

03:58:19.436 --> 03:58:21.435
LAURA: Because we're expecting it.
MARISHA: I don't think that's true.

03:58:21.435 --> 03:58:24.526
LAURA: An ambush means that they take you by surprise.

03:58:24.526 --> 03:58:27.136
MARISHA: They know so much more.

03:58:27.136 --> 03:58:29.876
We don't even know realistically why we're here.

03:58:29.876 --> 03:58:31.729
We're chasing a ghost.

03:58:33.726 --> 03:58:36.746
They've got the entire upper hand right now.

03:58:36.746 --> 03:58:38.696
LIAM: You're not really selling your point.

03:58:39.686 --> 03:58:41.256
MARISHA: How am I not?

03:58:41.256 --> 03:58:42.089
They've got--

03:58:42.089 --> 03:58:45.296
LIAM: Saying "let's go in."
MARISHA: They're holding all of the cards.

03:58:45.296 --> 03:58:47.416
Why would we fight that?

03:58:47.416 --> 03:58:50.516
You can't go up against the house when it's like that,

03:58:50.516 --> 03:58:51.349
so.

03:58:53.176 --> 03:58:55.426
TRAVIS: Beau has a small point.

03:58:55.426 --> 03:58:57.903
We don't even know what it is they want,

03:58:57.903 --> 03:58:59.969
what they're trying to do or accomplish.

03:59:01.416 --> 03:59:04.829
It seems like something that we should stop. It feels evil,

03:59:05.716 --> 03:59:08.159
but Vess DeRogna was no saint.

03:59:09.746 --> 03:59:11.646
MARISHA: Whatever that they're doing

03:59:11.646 --> 03:59:12.479
that's evil,

03:59:12.479 --> 03:59:14.966
whatever ritual that they're trying to accomplish,

03:59:14.966 --> 03:59:17.819
they're not going to accomplish it tonight.

03:59:17.819 --> 03:59:19.896
TRAVIS: We think.
MARISHA: They're trying to-- they can't.

03:59:19.896 --> 03:59:21.446
They're going somewhere.

03:59:21.446 --> 03:59:22.836
They're trying to gather something.

03:59:22.836 --> 03:59:25.307
They've got this book back from Vess DeRogna,

03:59:25.307 --> 03:59:26.526
from the source,

03:59:26.526 --> 03:59:29.046
super mad at myself that I didn't think, like,

03:59:29.046 --> 03:59:31.246
that he was speaking very literally,

03:59:31.246 --> 03:59:34.026
that he was taking it from her directly.

03:59:34.026 --> 03:59:36.049
So he has that piece of the puzzle.

03:59:37.516 --> 03:59:39.206
Beyond that, we don't know,

03:59:39.206 --> 03:59:41.536
other than we know that he's here gathering shit

03:59:41.536 --> 03:59:42.815
for some reason.

03:59:42.815 --> 03:59:44.481
LIAM: I just talk to the air.
MARISHA: And we're--

03:59:44.481 --> 03:59:45.716
LIAM: Are you getting all this?

03:59:45.716 --> 03:59:47.516
MARISHA: I'm sure he is. We still being watched?

03:59:47.516 --> 03:59:49.374
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm-- it's up, lasts for an hour,

03:59:49.374 --> 03:59:50.556
so I can look.

03:59:50.556 --> 03:59:52.246
MATT: Yeah, no sign of anything around you.

03:59:52.246 --> 03:59:53.079
TRAVIS: No, we're good.

03:59:53.079 --> 03:59:53.912
TALIESIN: I say,

03:59:55.406 --> 03:59:57.706
you're not wrong, they're going to tell us what's going on.

03:59:57.706 --> 04:00:00.706
I don't think that this necessarily,

04:00:02.352 --> 04:00:03.866
this doesn't feel like an ambush

04:00:03.866 --> 04:00:06.696
because they wouldn't be setting us up for this

04:00:07.646 --> 04:00:10.296
and let us walk in, I guess?

04:00:10.296 --> 04:00:11.426
MARISHA: Yeah, he thinks he's here

04:00:11.426 --> 04:00:13.786
because we're competing against him,

04:00:13.786 --> 04:00:14.619
or

04:00:16.656 --> 04:00:19.056
he knows we have no clue what's going on and

04:00:19.056 --> 04:00:22.616
we're simply chasing him and he is leading us into a trap.

04:00:22.616 --> 04:00:24.656
TALIESIN: It's also entirely possible that he doesn't know

04:00:24.656 --> 04:00:26.019
why we're chasing him.

04:00:28.666 --> 04:00:30.066
MARISHA: He knows enough.

04:00:30.066 --> 04:00:31.676
TRAVIS: We're going in, right?

04:00:31.676 --> 04:00:33.184
TALIESIN: We are.
TRAVIS: We always decided on--

04:00:33.184 --> 04:00:36.946
TALIESIN: I also may have a Locate Creature spell, so

04:00:38.296 --> 04:00:40.851
we can lock in on Cree.

04:00:41.736 --> 04:00:43.719
MARISHA: Even five against seven.

04:00:46.406 --> 04:00:50.346
He snuck into a member of the Cerberus Assembly's room

04:00:50.346 --> 04:00:51.499
and murdered her.

04:00:52.776 --> 04:00:53.609
No problem.

04:00:55.363 --> 04:00:58.576
Someone that we repeatedly said, time and time again,

04:00:58.576 --> 04:01:00.576
even after she died,

04:01:00.576 --> 04:01:02.526
that she's a member of the Cerberus Assembly,

04:01:02.526 --> 04:01:05.356
no one should be worried about her, she can protect herself.

04:01:05.356 --> 04:01:07.596
We said that after she died.

04:01:07.596 --> 04:01:08.429
So

04:01:10.466 --> 04:01:13.066
whatever we're working with, we don't know what it is.

04:01:13.066 --> 04:01:15.036
We are following them in blindly.

04:01:15.036 --> 04:01:16.966
We've done that before, we did it with Obann

04:01:16.966 --> 04:01:18.986
and it worked okay in our favor,

04:01:18.986 --> 04:01:21.153
but we were chasing Yasha.

04:01:23.266 --> 04:01:25.506
We don't know what we're chasing right now.

04:01:25.506 --> 04:01:26.706
SAM: There is--

04:01:26.706 --> 04:01:28.096
These are great points.

04:01:28.096 --> 04:01:31.666
We have nothing that we can do to solve them, though.

04:01:31.666 --> 04:01:33.456
MARISHA: But join them.

04:01:33.456 --> 04:01:34.316
SAM: How?

04:01:34.316 --> 04:01:36.486
MARISHA: Follow where they're going.

04:01:36.486 --> 04:01:38.350
Just go along for the ride.
SAM: How is that different

04:01:38.350 --> 04:01:39.441
from what we're about to do?

04:01:39.441 --> 04:01:40.734
We're going down there anyway.

04:01:40.734 --> 04:01:41.567
MARISHA: We're not going to--

04:01:41.567 --> 04:01:43.350
It's the difference between saying,

04:01:43.350 --> 04:01:46.546
"Hey, what's up," and fighting them right now.

04:01:46.546 --> 04:01:48.037
TALIESIN: That's a fair point.

04:01:48.037 --> 04:01:50.259
SAM: We don't have to fight them.
MARISHA: We either go down--

04:01:50.259 --> 04:01:52.478
So that's the conversation, then?

04:01:52.478 --> 04:01:54.426
TALIESIN: We try and talk before anything.

04:01:54.426 --> 04:01:57.516
LIAM: I don't think there's any
question that we're going in.

04:01:57.516 --> 04:01:58.386
MARISHA: No.

04:01:58.386 --> 04:02:00.446
I'm not debating that.

04:02:00.446 --> 04:02:03.106
I'm debating what do we do when we find them?

04:02:03.106 --> 04:02:05.606
TRAVIS: I have no problem listening.

04:02:08.505 --> 04:02:10.896
TALIESIN: Do our best to defend ourselves

04:02:10.896 --> 04:02:11.987
and have a conversation.

04:02:11.987 --> 04:02:13.953
TRAVIS: We just had dinner with fucking yetis

04:02:13.953 --> 04:02:16.978
for christ's sake. I'm fine listening.

04:02:18.436 --> 04:02:19.269
MARISHA: All right.

04:02:20.536 --> 04:02:23.029
He's going to watch us as we go down.

04:02:23.029 --> 04:02:25.446
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: I think the more amicable we've seen,

04:02:28.486 --> 04:02:31.469
it means we are not resurrecting someone tomorrow.

04:02:32.976 --> 04:02:35.809
LIAM: Yeah, we'll see how it goes.

04:02:37.606 --> 04:02:39.917
MARISHA: Not saying we're joining him--
LIAM: There's no choice but to go in.

04:02:39.917 --> 04:02:42.803
We've no choice but to go in.

04:02:42.803 --> 04:02:47.066
He murdered a high-powered government official.

04:02:47.066 --> 04:02:49.206
Looks like we did, of course we're going in.

04:02:49.206 --> 04:02:50.149
We have no plan.

04:02:51.326 --> 04:02:53.540
I am not joining something I don't know what it is.

04:02:53.540 --> 04:02:55.141
It doesn't change what we're going to do.

04:02:55.141 --> 04:02:57.434
We are going to go in at a disadvantage

04:02:57.434 --> 04:02:58.534
to find out--
MARISHA: There's a difference between--

04:02:58.534 --> 04:02:59.367
joining and--

04:02:59.367 --> 04:03:02.506
LIAM: This is semantics, Beauregard, we're going in!

04:03:02.506 --> 04:03:03.339
I'm not going to agree--
MARISHA: I'm not debating

04:03:03.339 --> 04:03:07.076
that we're not going in.
LIAM: -- to join the Eyes of Nine in advance.

04:03:07.076 --> 04:03:10.136
MARISHA: I'm not suggesting that we join the Eyes of Nine

04:03:10.136 --> 04:03:13.886
and slit our wrists and do some sort of ritualistic magic.

04:03:13.886 --> 04:03:16.139
That's not what I am suggesting.

04:03:17.146 --> 04:03:18.996
And I know we're going in.

04:03:18.996 --> 04:03:22.346
I'm only presenting a plan for when we encounter them.

04:03:22.346 --> 04:03:25.639
SAM: And the plan is that we'll talk first.

04:03:27.076 --> 04:03:28.366
Fine. Let's go.

04:03:28.366 --> 04:03:30.476
MARISHA: You can get in the car with someone

04:03:30.476 --> 04:03:33.726
and see where they're headed without--

04:03:33.726 --> 04:03:35.003
TALIESIN: Let's take it one step at a time.

04:03:35.003 --> 04:03:36.857
LIAM: I like your optimism.

04:03:36.857 --> 04:03:39.536
TALIESIN: If the road looks like
it's opening up in that direction.

04:03:39.536 --> 04:03:40.369
MARISHA: I'm not opt--

04:03:40.369 --> 04:03:43.406
don't mistake any of this for optimism like I have hope

04:03:43.406 --> 04:03:45.694
TRAVIS: I'll start walking towards the entrance.

04:03:45.694 --> 04:03:47.361
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm into that.

04:03:49.163 --> 04:03:51.806
MARISHA: I just don't want anything to be misconstrued

04:03:51.806 --> 04:03:54.406
that I am joining in some sort of evil force,

04:03:54.406 --> 04:03:56.036
but

04:03:56.036 --> 04:03:57.179
fighting it head on doesn't seem like

04:03:57.179 --> 04:03:58.656
the point.
LIAM: I'm already walking

04:03:58.656 --> 04:03:59.489
after Fjord.

04:03:59.489 --> 04:04:01.639
MARISHA: All right, cool.
TALIESIN: We get it. We get it.

04:04:01.639 --> 04:04:03.197
TRAVIS: We're on the same page.

04:04:04.236 --> 04:04:05.069
MATT: Okay.

04:04:05.069 --> 04:04:06.346
Fjord and Caleb enter the cavern.

04:04:06.346 --> 04:04:07.587
TALIESIN: We're gonna turn and kill you the second

04:04:07.587 --> 04:04:08.450
you say yes.

04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:11.268
(laughter)

04:04:12.176 --> 04:04:13.556
MATT: Anybody else follow after them?

04:04:13.556 --> 04:04:14.389
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

04:04:15.226 --> 04:04:17.626
SAM: Are we sending Frumpkin ahead? Are we doing anything?

04:04:17.626 --> 04:04:19.673
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's actually fair.

04:04:19.673 --> 04:04:21.106
TALIESIN: Frumpkin's a good idea.

04:04:22.259 --> 04:04:23.542
LAURA: I feel like me and Yasha are standing

04:04:23.542 --> 04:04:25.539
outside of the cave for a minute.

04:04:26.486 --> 04:04:27.434
ASHLEY: I mean,

04:04:30.356 --> 04:04:31.756
they could've killed us, too.

04:04:32.786 --> 04:04:33.686
LAURA: Sure.

04:04:33.686 --> 04:04:36.499
ASHLEY: You know, they didn't come after us.

04:04:37.681 --> 04:04:38.514
LAURA: Yeah.

04:04:38.514 --> 04:04:40.549
ASHLEY: Not that that means much, but--

04:04:45.543 --> 04:04:47.276
LAURA: We don't really have a choice.

04:04:48.156 --> 04:04:48.989
ASHLEY: Let's go.

04:04:51.334 --> 04:04:52.454
LIAM: This is stupid.

04:04:52.454 --> 04:04:55.126
I place my hand on Fjord's shoulder.

04:04:55.126 --> 04:04:56.743
MATT: Well, one by one,

04:04:57.826 --> 04:05:02.099
you all step into the beginning entrance of the cavern.

04:05:03.176 --> 04:05:04.686
As the shadow begins to take you

04:05:04.686 --> 04:05:07.616
and you prepare the next length of your journey

04:05:07.616 --> 04:05:09.679
into the subterranean unknown,

04:05:10.776 --> 04:05:14.175
on the heels of Mollymauk,

04:05:14.175 --> 04:05:16.767
or whatever he calls himself now,

04:05:18.226 --> 04:05:20.829
and old friends he carries with him.

04:05:22.176 --> 04:05:23.569
We'll pick up there next week.

04:05:25.152 --> 04:05:26.368
SAM: (groans)
TRAVIS: (drumbeats)

04:05:26.368 --> 04:05:27.877
ASHLEY: Dungeon crawl.

04:05:27.877 --> 04:05:30.651
MARISHA: Deeper and deeper we go.

04:05:30.651 --> 04:05:31.826
LIAM: ♪ Making my way ♪
ASHLEY: I don't know what to think about this.

04:05:31.826 --> 04:05:33.157
TRAVIS: Always dumb.

04:05:33.157 --> 04:05:34.474
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: (laughs)

04:05:34.474 --> 04:05:36.916
MATT: Got a little time to think on this.

04:05:36.916 --> 04:05:41.206
and we'll pick up there as you delve into

04:05:41.206 --> 04:05:42.732
your first

04:05:43.596 --> 04:05:45.899
excavation, outer excavation of Aeor.

04:05:45.899 --> 04:05:47.486
LAURA: (high pitched squeak)

04:05:47.486 --> 04:05:48.426
MATT: I'm excited, you guys.

04:05:48.426 --> 04:05:50.444
LIAM: Just five more hours, Dad.

04:05:50.444 --> 04:05:52.515
TRAVIS: I exploded my stress ball.

04:05:52.515 --> 04:05:53.715
MATT: You did it!

04:05:53.715 --> 04:05:55.458
ASHLEY: Just let us in!
TRAVIS: It went everywhere.

04:05:55.458 --> 04:05:56.915
MARISHA and SAM: Wait.

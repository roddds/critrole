00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.725
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:03.910
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.692
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:08.740
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.920
MATT: Yes.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.630
Before we get into tonight's episode,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.980
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.296
beginning with the first of two sponsors,

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:17.180
NordVPN.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.630
Sam?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.850
SAM: Matt, you rat bastard, don't even try it,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.580
or should I use your evil haxor username, Ultra Kodex?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.960
LAURA: You data fragged Travis.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.170
My husband is frozen in stasis.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.003
ASHLEY: Oh no!

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.161
LAURA: Travis, can you hear me?

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:35.702
Baby?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.540
SAM: (sighs)

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.970
And you wreaked havoc on one of our favorite sponsors,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.110
NordVPN, providers of highest quality data encryption

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.350
for your internet traffic and it hides your IP

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.040
and physical location!

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.240
LAURA: And it's NordVPN's birthday.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.620
What are your demands, you motherboard monster?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.280
MATT: Don't you see?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.870
It's these ridiculous NordVPN ads.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.790
Three minutes of endless Sam and Laura, Sam and Laura!

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.680
I can't take it!

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.550
SAM: Wait, wait, you just want us

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.020
leet code monkeys to stop doing ads for NordVPN?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.228
MATT: No!

00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:13.170
I want to do them myself.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.640
The power of the Nordverse

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.350
shouldn't be in your noob keystrokes,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.600
it should lie within the Ultra Kodex.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.480
SAM: What? No, our sponsor would never hire

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.930
such an unhinged spokesman.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.140
MATT: Well, they hired you, didn't they?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.630
SAM: Oh, ice cold.
MATT: Fine.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.463
SAM: Ice cold.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.288
MATT: If I can't control the Nordaverse,

00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:33.880
then I shall defrag all of NordVPN. (laughs)

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.150
LAURA: You'll have to brute force
through us, Johnny Mnemonic.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.160
MATT: Are you challenging me to a hack off?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.930
But there's two of you and only one of me.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.590
You don't stand a chance.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.310
SAM: Oh, we'll see about that, you root-kit rat.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.560
Cryptonic Override.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.890
Time to--

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.443
Wait, nope, that's not it. Where is it?

00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:54.543
Jack in!

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:55.960
(laughter)

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.901
LAURA: Okay.

00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:59.250
(laughter)
(keyboard clacking)

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.930
Affirmation, BlackWillow69.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.340
Firewall up, he's going down.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.860
MATT: You know what you have in common with pizza and bread?

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.209
You're much better sliced.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.252
(gasping)

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:13.761
The hack off is on.

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.250
SAM: Ah.
MATT: I need to get this--

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.140
SAM: What's he doing? Where's he going?

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.206
MATT: There it is.
SAM: What is that?

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:20.350
MATT: Ha!
SAM: What is that thing?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.522
LIAM: The helmet.
LAURA: Oh no.

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:24.970
BlackWillow, he's drowning me in spectral basal code,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.510
I'm going monochromatic.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.836
SAM: What? No, try techno-lusting his universal soldier.

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.200
LAURA: I did, but he just bandersnatched

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.580
my Jumping Jack flash drive.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.930
MATT: What's wrong?

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.870
Can't handle a simple eenie meenie Bieber rhythm attack?

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.182
SAM: Stay with me, Cryptonic!

00:02:43.182 --> 00:02:47.867
LAURA: I can't, there's just too many of them.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:51.166
He's slicing me!

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:55.540
SAM: No! Negatoid! You fragged my partner,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.300
the only woman I've ever loved.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.133
MATT: Wait, what?

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.480
SAM: Oh, nothing, nothing.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.800
Travis, you're still frozen, right?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.810
Cool, cool.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.200
Anyway, back to the hack.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.140
MATT: It's over, BlackWillow, or should I say whack pillow?

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.973
SAM: Terrible.

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:15.050
MATT: I've pwned your friends,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.780
and I'm about to gleam your cube as well.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.650
SAM: Okay.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.730
MATT: After all I already know your master password.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.870
SAM: No, no, not--

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.078
MATT: Swordfish.

00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:26.911
SAM: Damn it!

00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:29.360
MATT: It's always swordfish.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.620
SAM: Goddamn, I should have known.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.950
MATT: One crypto kick, and you'll drop faster

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.890
than GameStop stock.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.730
Any last words?

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.030
SAM: Yes.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.963
I have last words.

00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:41.554
For NordVPN's birthday,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.840
every purchase of a two-year plan will get you

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.760
one additional month free and a surprise gift.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.343
Go to https-- seriously-- slash-slash

00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:53.360
nordvpn.com/criticalrole

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.840
and use code criticalrole.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.580
Protect yourself from cyber attacks,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.260
and avoid bandwidth issues with NordVPN.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.790
And thanks for continuing their support of our show.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.130
Matt, we'll continue this next time, hack to you.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.434
MATT: It had to be this terrible helmet.

00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:11.120
MARISHA: It's the best helmet.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.953
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:13.540
MARISHA: It just takes away--
MATT: Thank you, NordVPN.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.043
SAM: I heard none of that.

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:16.484
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Just no neck.

00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:17.331
ASHLEY: No movement.

00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:18.164
MARISHA: Yeah, just--

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.484
Old Michael Keaton Batman.

00:04:21.484 --> 00:04:22.317
MATT: Yep, yep.

00:04:22.317 --> 00:04:24.000
ASHLEY: One eyeball coming through.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.980
LIAM: I liked how you, to see, had to turn the entire axis

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.170
of the helmet.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.651
SAM: The character choices are really interesting.
LAURA: Don't watch me undress, camera!

00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:36.240
Why every time?!
TRAVIS: Not the way I wrote it. Interesting.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.073
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.136
And big thank you to our friends at D&amp;D Beyond--

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:43.490
SAM: Oh, the other thing that you guys don't know,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.310
they're going to do special effects in post

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.310
that'll make it look like-- Well, I won't-- I can spoil it.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.930
It's going to make it look like she turns black and white.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.090
LAURA: Really?
SAM: Yeah.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.960
MARISHA: Kyle, is that true?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.145
SAM: I think so.
KYLE: (from backstage) Yeah.

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:56.093
MARISHA: All right.

00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:57.370
LAURA: Whoa!

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.412
TRAVIS: Which means it already happened

00:04:58.412 --> 00:04:59.930
and now we're just talking about it after the fact.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.024
SAM: Yeah, we didn't know!

00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:03.015
TALIESIN: Everybody else already knows

00:05:03.015 --> 00:05:04.806
we're the last to know, literally.

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:08.551
ASHLEY: I also love that it's turning into a love story.

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:09.680
(laughter)

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.347
SAM: Well.
ASHLEY: This just goes deep.

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:12.880
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: It needed something.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.970
ASHLEY: Yeah, it needed a little--

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.260
MARISHA: Every blockbuster has to have that love story.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.357
MATT: Well, we're all knee-deep in that Nord lore.

00:05:19.357 --> 00:05:20.939
(laughter)

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:22.530
TRAVIS: "Nord lore."

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.860

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.960
ASHLEY: Just knee-deep in that Nord lore.

MATT: Yeah.
SAM: (disgusted noises)

00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:35.157
MATT: I'm a Nord lore whore, guys.

00:05:35.157 --> 00:05:36.679
MARISHA: Rolled Nord Lore.

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:38.240

They're spotlighting awesome folks

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.930
and projects in the tabletop community.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.680
And the new episode airs this Tuesday,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.010
February 23rd at 4:00pm Pacific on Twitch.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.280
And then, of course, the VOD on February 25th

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.840
because that's how our VODs have always worked.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.931
And then, in case you missed it,

00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:38.139
our second episode of Crit Recap Animated

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:40.122
is now on YouTube.

00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:41.841
(cheering)

00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:44.820
Yeah. Dives into the first story arc
of the Mighty Nein campaign.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.303
It's super cute.
Go watch it if you haven't.

00:07:47.303 --> 00:07:50.260
With narration by our Lore Keeper Dani Carr,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.060
animation by Offworld Studios,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.558
and writing by Dani, Kyle, and me.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.190
(cheering)

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.110
Check it out, it's great.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.443
Go watch it. Get a refresher.

00:08:01.443 --> 00:08:03.359
LIAM: Now it's moving into aggressive.

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:06.872
MATT: Yeah. She's good at that.
MARISHA: Fucking watch it.

00:08:06.872 --> 00:08:09.790
MATT: Okay. Quickly, we're also going over to Laura

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.950
for the last bit of our announcements.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.090
LAURA: Oh, hi.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.029
I am telling you about this.
SAM: Hey!

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.279
(cheering)

00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:20.315
TRAVIS: Long-sleeve hooded shirt.

00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:22.860
SAM: -- sleeve hooded?
LAURA: Yes, and-- wait.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.931
And also, you have the other shirt.

00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:27.750
♪ Da da dum. Bah da dum! ♪

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.200
Both of these shirts are designed by Bryan Weiss.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.420
You may recognize the designs,
but now they're on new things.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.646
And they're in our US store right now.

00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:39.037
Coming soon to other stores, dotah!

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.823
In addition to that, we have--

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.830
ASHLEY: What is it?

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.420
LAURA: A brand new Scanlan dice set.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.180
I just showed them to Sam--
MARISHA: Purple baggies.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.013
SAM: They're really cool--

00:08:52.013 --> 00:08:53.340
LAURA: Oh yeah, they're purple baggies,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.221
and then the inside has the hot pink.
I don't know if you knew that.

00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:57.579
SAM: I didn't know that!
LAURA: Yeah, because Scanlan.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:58.630
SAM: And they're so shiny.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.360
LAURA: They are so shiny and
kind of troll-y at the same time.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.193
LIAM: Magic.

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.249
ASHLEY: Are they sparkly?
SAM: Yeah.

00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:08.960
LAURA: Oh, and these are everywhere right now

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.877
in all our stores, including our new Canadian store.

00:09:11.877 --> 00:09:12.710
SAM: Ooh!

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.283
LAURA: Go Canada.

00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:16.108
MATT: (laughs) Awesome.

00:09:16.108 --> 00:09:17.232
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:20.375
LAURA: Oh, I should say that's canada.critrole.com.

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:23.670
SAM: Wait, canada.critrole.com?

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.290
LAURA: That's what it says on this page, Sam.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.123
SAM: Okay.

00:09:27.123 --> 00:09:30.177
MATT: I trust, I trust.

00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:32.040
Well, I believe--
MARISHA: Canada before Crit Role.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.363
MATT: Exactly.

00:09:33.363 --> 00:09:35.840
That brings us to the end of our announcements, and as such,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.340
let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of--

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.700
LIAM: Oh boy.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.700
MATT: -- Critical Role.

00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:44.306

MATT: Welcome back.

00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:20.743
That was terrible, you guys--

00:11:20.743 --> 00:11:21.790
LIAM: That was too much.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.944
MATT: -- stopped giving a shit
over the time we've doing this.

00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:26.790
(laughter)

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.460
Last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.640
after making their way across Eiselcross

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.530
encountering and fleeing from the Tomb Takers,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.512
meeting up with their old "companion"-- in quotes-- Essek

00:11:41.512 --> 00:11:43.750
and discussing the possibility of delving

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.890
into Aeor's ruins specifically.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.520
After deciding to take some time

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.260
with the brief respite you have

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.380
after sending the Tomb Takers seeking another alternative

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.800
to the threshold crest that they had lost,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.000
you made your way towards Yussa.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.070
You went ahead and looked

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.070
into some possibilities of how to prepare for this.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.750
Acquired some friends to help you, to provide some options,

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.758
some items.

00:12:10.758 --> 00:12:13.630
Spoke with Halas, shunted Halas.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.920
Went and visited Kima and Allura over in Emon, and

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.770
let them know what you were going to be attempting.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.760
In doing so, you were also provided with some aid

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.578
from their end,

00:12:23.578 --> 00:12:26.269
as well as some items loaned.

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:29.252
One was offered, one was...

00:12:29.252 --> 00:12:31.685
surprisingly convinced

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:35.753
to temporarily lend a very powerful item.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.860
If only we could find a way to use it.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.280
But you returned to Rexxentrum.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.930
And after hearing a little bit

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.180
of the current murmurs politically between the Cobalt Soul

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.983
and other aspects of the Empire, realized that

00:12:51.983 --> 00:12:54.210
beyond just the tension building in Eiselcross,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.286
things are a bit tense here at home,

00:12:56.286 --> 00:13:01.286
even in the aftermath of the peace treaty that was signed.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.360
After gathering yourselves for an evening's rest

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.142
after a very long day of hopping

00:13:06.142 --> 00:13:07.853
literally around Exandria,

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.223
you went after

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.010
acquiring a chamber

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.060
within the Rexxentrum archive to rest, lay down.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.360
And a few of you were visited by curious dreams.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.251
Caduceus, with an odd vision regarding

00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:27.951
something similar to the Grove where he grew up.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.970
Yasha, with a unique encounter with the Storm Lord

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.860
of which it had been some time.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.156
And Caleb and Beauregard,

00:13:40.156 --> 00:13:44.060
who had a second evening encounter

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.930
with some leering red eyes,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.713
welcoming you to whatever odd, dream state connection

00:13:52.713 --> 00:13:54.060
you currently harbor with them.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.700
TRAVIS: You fucking dicks.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.433
MATT: And so with that,

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.910
a day of rest is completed. A morning greets you.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.920
You are absolved

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.150
of whatever remaining lingering exhaustion points

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.330
you may have carried. You are healed.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.038
But for some of you,

00:14:14.038 --> 00:14:18.884
not the most restful evening of sleep.

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:20.833
As you all begin to gather your things,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.273
what would you like to do?

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.826
LIAM: Well, I think after a night like that,

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:31.276
the first thing I want to do is

00:14:31.276 --> 00:14:32.500
strip naked in front of a mirror.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.650
MARISHA: Yeah, I find Caleb and do the same thing.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:40.093
I start subtly, like, pulling up sleeves.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.223
LIAM: Is there anything on my backside?

00:14:44.223 --> 00:14:45.760
MARISHA: Uh.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.768
Lift up his shirt like I'm looking for ticks. Anything?

00:14:48.768 --> 00:14:50.960
TRAVIS: Are y'all alone, or are we
in the back eating popcorn for this?

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.079
LAURA: Because we're like-- Yeah.

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:53.687
TRAVIS: I would totally be here for it.
LAURA: We're all in the same room.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:56.142
MARISHA: I think we only got
two rooms between the two of us.

00:14:56.142 --> 00:14:57.957
So probably in front of people.

00:14:57.957 --> 00:14:59.050
MATT: A few of you are seeing this.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.720
It isn't like--
LIAM: So we're in the corner?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.444
MARISHA: In the corner being weird.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:03.720
MATT: Frantically searching each other for ticks.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.190
It's a thing.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.720
MATT: With a brief investigation of Caleb,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.720
you see a second red eye has apparated

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.053
in the center of the shoulder blades in the back.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.563
MARISHA: I just tap on it. (clicking)

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.100
LIAM: Turn around, let me see your neck.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.000
MATT: You look where the tattoo that she acquired

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.800
from Orly is, and right square

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.294
in the center of the tattoo with a previous eye was,

00:15:35.294 --> 00:15:38.553
you see a glowing red eye has appeared.

00:15:38.553 --> 00:15:39.511
LAURA: Oh no!

00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:43.380
TRAVIS: Separate locations for them, right,

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.550
not like in between his scapula shoulder blades--

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.887
MATT: Yeah. Different locations.

00:15:47.887 --> 00:15:49.780
LIAM: Yeah, just like the first were in different places.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.390
TRAVIS: Shoulder for you, in between your shoulder blades,

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.509
back of your neck, and where?

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:55.300
LAURA: Hand.
MARISHA: And my hand.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.080
ASHLEY: So you each have two now?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.290
LAURA: Yeah.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.619
SAM: Are there pupils? Are they colored?

00:16:02.619 --> 00:16:04.121
MATT: Just a solid red.

00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:05.310
SAM: All of them are the same color--

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.330
MATT: All of them are the same color.
SAM: -- not shades of red, okay.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.150
MARISHA: How does it go with the green, with the emerald?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.865
SAM: I mean, it's kind of nice.
MARISHA: Yeah?

00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:12.898
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Festive.

00:16:12.898 --> 00:16:15.831
MARISHA: Yeah. Complementary colors?
SAM: Reminds me of Winter's Crest. Yeah.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.763
LIAM: Do we feel any different?

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.880
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.200
LIAM: Find me, Google Docs.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.270
Nope. Nope.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.850
SAM: You can't say Google.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.222
Oh shit, I said it!

00:16:32.222 --> 00:16:36.470
(laughter)

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.403
LIAM: 16.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.513
TRAVIS: Same as it ever was.
We ain't learned shit.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.250
MATT: In the midst of all this chaos and tension,

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.230
you take a moment to just check

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.120
in with yourself and quietly breathe and feel

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.203
and gauge where you sit physically, emotionally.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.150
You don't sense any different.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.690
Nothing seems to be shifted, elevated,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.550
diminished, beyond just the trail of adrenaline

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.850
that's still pumping through your system

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.760
post-discovery this morning.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.175
LIAM: A lot of screaming.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.658
MARISHA: Yeah, more talk of dreams

00:17:19.658 --> 00:17:21.560
and what we can craft from them.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.751
Did you get that?

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.720
LIAM: Shit.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.553
MARISHA: Fuck.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.060
LIAM: It's not every night.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.401
MARISHA: No.
LIAM: But...

00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:38.782
ticking clock.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.685
MARISHA: Do you think this is they're counting it based on

00:17:43.685 --> 00:17:46.900
the individual, or like we're--

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.390
they're counting it between us?

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.633
Are we growing exponentially here?

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.660
That's probably not right.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.150
SAM: Growing--?

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.600
LIAM: In ability, in power, or--

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.640
MARISHA: In the amount of eyes.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.613
LIAM: Amount of eyes.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.160
I mean, it's all conjecture at this point.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.681
The only thing I'm feeling is that we need to--

00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:11.280
whatever plan we are going to cobble together,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.050
we need to do it fairly quickly and act on it.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.658
Good morning, everyone.

00:18:15.658 --> 00:18:17.066
MARISHA: Morning.
ASHLEY: Good morning.

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:17.899
TALIESIN: Hey.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.270
TRAVIS: Can you reach out

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.920
to Lucien or any of the other Tomb Takers?

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.553
Have you tried to connect your mind?

00:18:28.493 --> 00:18:30.970
MARISHA: It's crossed my mind, but I haven't tried.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.270
I'm willing to try, though.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.663
LIAM: Hey, asshole.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.550
LAURA: I don't know, how would we know?

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.725
I could try scrying on him and see. Ugh.

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:50.493
I hate it. I feel icky when I try to do it, but I could.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.510
MARISHA: Think he can see through these?

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.041
LAURA: I don't know.

00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:57.730
LIAM: It doesn't seem like he needs to see through these.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:58.800
He can see, anyway.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.160
TRAVIS: I think with his magic, though, he knows exactly

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.083
where you are.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.100
LIAM: So what are we going to do today?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.950
We could get some shopping done.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.440
This is as good as it gets for supplies

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.220
and anything you need.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.478
SAM: Wait, where are we again?

00:19:16.478 --> 00:19:17.403
LIAM: Rexxentrum.

00:19:17.403 --> 00:19:18.688
SAM: Thank you.

00:19:18.688 --> 00:19:19.521
TALIESIN: Get around.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.926
MARISHA: Heading to Nicodranas soon.

00:19:22.926 --> 00:19:25.170
TALIESIN: One of the last two stops, as far as I know.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.180
LIAM: Yeah, is Nicodranas sort of our jumping

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.030
off point for when we're ready to go?

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.985
TALIESIN: Actually, I need to go home before we--

00:19:31.985 --> 00:19:32.947
LAURA: You need to go home?

00:19:32.947 --> 00:19:34.200
TALIESIN: I do.
LIAM: Okay.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.033
SAM: Why?

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.100
TALIESIN: It was a piece of the puzzle.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.866
I don't know. I had a dream.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:44.843
MARISHA: A dream.

00:19:44.843 --> 00:19:46.920
LAURA: Do you have eye-- do you have an eye?

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.260
TALIESIN: I have two.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.176
LAURA: No! You know what I mean, Caduceus!

00:19:50.176 --> 00:19:51.360
LIAM: I look in his armpit.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.580
MARISHA: I lift up his armpit.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.520
TALIESIN: It's just a birthmark.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.990
It's not shaped like an eye or anything.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.140
If anything, it should probably be looked at.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.130
LIAM: Smells like sandalwood.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.030
MARISHA: Yeah, it does.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.863
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:20:00.863 --> 00:20:01.780
MARISHA: A little eucalyptus.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.506
TALIESIN: I wear a little, well--

00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:05.497
(laughter)

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.701
It's been a day.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.730
I had a dream that made me

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.160
think that there's some connection.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.065
That there's something I should see.

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:16.956
I don't know.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.360
I wasn't planning on going home,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.570
but I think I have to.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.633
MARISHA: A connection

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.720
to the Astral Sea, to Lucien?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.473
TALIESIN: To what we're fighting. I don't know.

00:20:28.473 --> 00:20:31.345
LAURA: Was it connected to the forest we saw?

00:20:31.345 --> 00:20:32.762
TALIESIN: I think it was.

00:20:33.963 --> 00:20:35.363
TRAVIS: The one we burned?

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.310
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.560
LAURA: Is it bad that I burned it?

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.940
You think I made it worse?

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.540
TALIESIN: No, I genuinely think we did the right thing.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.373
LAURA: Okay.

00:20:45.373 --> 00:20:46.306
TALIESIN: But...

00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:53.727
I don't know. I didn't want to go home,
but I think I have to.

00:20:53.727 --> 00:20:58.000
LAURA: Do we need to go there before Nicodranas, or--?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.900
TALIESIN: That's up to you.

00:21:00.465 --> 00:21:04.480
LIAM: Well, I think we should just agree on our musts.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.930
The things that we need done.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.730
I think that Jester's idea to approach my old friends

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.360
and see if they would be willing to

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.283
procure more medallions for us,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.253
that might be possible.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:24.023
LAURA: It'd be wonderful if we could hide from them.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.430
LIAM: And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.483
And we just plunge ahead.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:31.860
I think there's enough

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:38.020
history between them and I that they would agree to meet.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.810
MARISHA: Just remember, let's try and find a quiet,

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.300
secretive place to meet with them,

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.830
since they are being investigated.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.470
LAURA: Maybe you can have them come to the tower.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.483
That seems like a nice secret place.

00:21:53.749 --> 00:21:54.729
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.660
LAURA: You don't have to show them the floor that has--

00:22:02.622 --> 00:22:04.222
You can keep it a secret.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.335
TALIESIN: Do we have any other friends in town?

00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:09.720
TRAVIS: Or could we upgrade the tower with some more,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.710
I don't know, like a bell chime?

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.820
People choose to come or go, or restrict their--

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.093
LIAM: I can already do that.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.450
Sorry, I'm just re-configuring my ideas for the day.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.013
We could do that.

00:22:24.013 --> 00:22:26.680
MARISHA: And we do have friends in town.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.200
TALIESIN: We could get a message to them without being seen.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.777
LAURA: I could also send a message
to them without being seen.

00:22:31.777 --> 00:22:33.227
TRAVIS: (laughs)
LIAM: That's a bingo.

00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:36.830
LAURA: You know, it's what I do.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.097
TALIESIN: It is what you do, that's fair.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.676
LIAM: So little bit of shopping, school friends.

00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:45.050
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.205
LIAM: Does anyone else have
anything to do here in this town?

00:22:48.205 --> 00:22:52.270
TRAVIS: I have a question for you, actually,

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.403
being the big arcane brain.

00:22:55.403 --> 00:22:57.900
In your time at the Cerberus Assembly,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.620
did you study any of what Lucien and the Tomb Takers do?

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.743
It's what Molly did, the blood magic.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.253
LIAM: I don't think so.

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:11.420
You mean specifically whether or not

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.531
I've come across knowledge in wider--

00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:15.720
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.270
LAURA: Well, we learned that they were

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.411
of the order of the Clarets.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.990
LIAM: 27.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.103
MATT: Damn.
ASHLEY: Wow.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.633
MATT: You've come across in your studies at school

00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:32.720
bits and pieces of what's called hemocraft.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.667
Hemocraft is a form of arcana

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:38.608
that is considered largely

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.516
necromancy-adjacent,

00:23:41.516 --> 00:23:43.350
and not formally taught.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.100
Largely because it uses blood

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.840
as a focus and as a tool for all sorts of spells.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:56.530
Which both from a divine worship standpoint,

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:57.955
and just from a societal standpoint,

00:23:57.955 --> 00:23:59.713
is largely misunderstood.

00:23:59.713 --> 00:24:01.738
Or embraced by people

00:24:01.738 --> 00:24:05.950
of less than moral persuasions.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.930
There are historical elements of blood mages

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.870
and people that have used and harnessed blood

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.880
as a power source and to do so you need a lot of blood.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.740
It usually involves a lot of bodies.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.422
So yeah, hemocraft historically is

00:24:19.422 --> 00:24:23.570
heavily frowned upon by most society and civilization.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.890
Those who practice it, there are different pursuits,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.550
but the orders are self-proclaimed

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.290
keepers of the secrets of hemocraft

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.300
and you've heard tales here and there

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.900
about some of them doing good things,

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.330
some of them doing bad things.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.890
They largely wander outside

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.130
in the outskirts of civilization for that reason,

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:47.640
for whatever their purposes may be.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.280
But that is what you would understand

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.140
from your studying in the realm

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.010
of what the Tomb Takers seem to be trained with.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.110
LIAM: Okay, so I would say I probably

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.221
dithered about a bunch of that.

00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:00.310
Was there something specific?

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.730
TRAVIS: Yeah, they mentioned they were,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.020
as Jester said, a part of the Claret Order.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.460
I just assumed that was a thing,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.930
like a temple or a religion or something.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.030
But does that mean there are more of them and if so,

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.340
is it a small group, a big group?

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.704
Is it someone that we should check in with to see if,

00:25:20.704 --> 00:25:23.880
I don't know, are the branches of the Claret Order

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.080
that are doing the same shit?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.540
Or would they be unhappy that these five are talking

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.790
to each other through a bunch of red, glowing eyeballs?

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.018
LIAM: It seems like that would've been a history.

00:25:34.018 --> 00:25:34.943
MATT: That would be history.

00:25:34.943 --> 00:25:36.810
MARISHA: I was going to say, would Beau have heard of this?

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.110
MATT: Both could roll a history check.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.097
LIAM: 27 again.

00:25:41.097 --> 00:25:42.437
MARISHA: Wow.

00:25:42.437 --> 00:25:44.640
Probably not as good.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.252
Well-- well. What's 14 plus 16?

00:25:48.252 --> 00:25:49.320
LIAM: A lot.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.129
MARISHA: 30?
MATT: 30.

00:25:51.129 --> 00:25:51.962
MARISHA: 30.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.480
TRAVIS: All right, Empire kids.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.190
(laughter)

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.260
LAURA: It's the eyes, the eyes give them special powers.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.520
ASHLEY: It's true.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.637
MATT: You know of the orders,

00:26:02.637 --> 00:26:05.786
but any location of theirs

00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:09.800
or any specifics is pretty well-kept on their guard because

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.610
if not, they would probably be hunted or at least subject

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.913
to all sorts of manhunts.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.680
But what you both would know is that

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.810
they're a little nomadic.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.330
There is no central location that they stick to.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.917
The few that did exist have been burned and toppled.

00:26:27.917 --> 00:26:29.228
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:26:29.228 --> 00:26:31.052
MATT: Probably once they were discovered by members

00:26:31.052 --> 00:26:34.800
of the Empire or even the Julous Dominion,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.880
the very, very beginning for those who were practicing

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.563
hemocraft, even before the orders really took place.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.624
LIAM: So it's a little bit like
trying to find the Court of the Owls.

00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:46.650
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.610
TRAVIS: Good ref.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.610
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.300
MATT: You would notice with your passive perception, Caleb,

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.650
as you're having this conversation

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:56.570
and maybe it's the conversation about hemocraft,

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.574
maybe it's just the rude awakening that led you

00:27:00.574 --> 00:27:02.103
to being a little more focused in the morning,

00:27:02.103 --> 00:27:03.970
but as everyone's getting their materials together

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.190
donning their armor to start the day, you notice,

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.332
beneath Fjord's undershirt,

00:27:09.332 --> 00:27:13.030
this faint red glow

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.410
that just ever so carefully catches your eye

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.190
at this proximity.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.960
Right across where the sternum is poking

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.250
outside of the shirt.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.200
TRAVIS: So I can see where you were looking.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.810
When we were--

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.340
in the quick hurry to get away, Lucien,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.550
while keeping his eyes on you,

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.650
sort of did a back swipe with his scimitar

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.670
and when he did, this arcane circle appeared

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.120
on my chest and it burned real bad.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.610
And I only thought of it this morning

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.500
because you guys have two more of those eyes.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.575
And so I just didn't know if

00:27:43.575 --> 00:27:45.442
you might know anything about that.

00:27:45.442 --> 00:27:47.210
LAURA: Well, take your shirt off, I want to see it.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.164
MARISHA: Wait, what?

00:27:49.164 --> 00:27:50.283
TRAVIS: (ripping)

00:27:50.283 --> 00:27:51.475
MARISHA: Ooh!
MATT: (laughs)

00:27:51.475 --> 00:27:53.600
ASHLEY: Whoa!
MARISHA: Ah!

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.433
ASHLEY: The beauty!

00:27:54.433 --> 00:27:55.837
MARISHA: Oh, it's blinding.

00:27:55.837 --> 00:27:57.011
TALIESIN: I'm rolling a d4 force damage.

00:27:57.011 --> 00:27:58.820
SAM: It's so skinny!

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.117
TRAVIS: Not anymore, bitch!

00:28:00.117 --> 00:28:01.674
SAM: So skinny.
TRAVIS: I've been lifting!

00:28:01.674 --> 00:28:02.882
SAM: It's like--
MARISHA: It's true!

00:28:02.882 --> 00:28:04.148
SAM: It's inverted.
TRAVIS: No!

00:28:04.148 --> 00:28:06.540
MARISHA: We've pumped up our reps!

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.831
LIAM: Everybody, this is fine.
TRAVIS: (bouncing)

00:28:09.831 --> 00:28:10.664
LIAM: This is fine.

00:28:10.664 --> 00:28:11.980
LAURA: What is it?

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.920
Do you recognize the symbol?

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.850
MATT: With the arcana check earlier.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.640
You do see it's very faint

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.360
and just barely visible on the skin.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.830
It looks almost like scars

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.650
in a circle pattern and it forms a glyph

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.580
with a series of symbols carved within it.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.130
And there's a very, very faint

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.053
deep reddish-purple glow.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.453
It is old hemocraft.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.233
It is a brand of some kind.

00:28:38.233 --> 00:28:41.000
You're uncertain necessarily of exactly what it does,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.853
but it remains on his chest.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.340
Well, you rolled a 27 on arcana.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.750
It is a brand.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.560
The best you can tell is it has some semblance

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.800
of divination attached to it.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.583
It bears some similar marks.

00:28:57.583 --> 00:28:58.416
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:28:58.416 --> 00:28:59.291
LIAM: Yeah.

00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:01.890
LAURA: Do you think it can be dispelled?

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.723
MARISHA: Maybe.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.393
LIAM: Dispel Magic.

00:29:05.247 --> 00:29:06.613
MATT: Dispel Magic?

00:29:06.613 --> 00:29:10.063
Okay. Let me check one thing real fast.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.000
Just to check in on my own shit.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.883
SAM: Wow.

00:29:15.883 --> 00:29:18.335
TRAVIS: You'd think I would have
noticed this while changing clothes,

00:29:18.335 --> 00:29:20.100
but fairly unaware.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.521
Apparently my passive perception sucks!

00:29:22.521 --> 00:29:23.480
MARISHA: Is it like a sunburn?

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.795
SAM: How often do you gaze at your own chest?
MARISHA: It gets redder?

00:29:25.795 --> 00:29:28.147
TRAVIS: I don't know about you, but every day, friend.

00:29:28.147 --> 00:29:29.400
MATT: If you could go ahead

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.525
and roll a d20

00:29:30.525 --> 00:29:33.410
and then add your intelligence modifier for me.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.243
LIAM: Low roll.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.495
Intelligence modifier?
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:37.495 --> 00:29:39.205
LIAM: Low roll. 12.

00:29:39.205 --> 00:29:41.320
MATT: 12. You go to dispel,

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.370
and there's a shimmer and it glows brighter for a second

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.740
and you swear for a brief moment

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.810
you feel like it's getting hotter--
TRAVIS: (yell of pain)

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.800
MATT: -- and then it just subsides, remains, unchanged.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.925
It reacted to the dispel,

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:57.270
but it did not scatter or vanish.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.120
ASHLEY: Did you say that it has scars and things?

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.811
MATT: It looks like a scar, almost,

00:30:02.811 --> 00:30:03.770
that wasn't there before,

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.070
but almost like it was branded into his chest.

00:30:07.054 --> 00:30:08.297
LIAM: I yell, "Don't move!"

00:30:08.297 --> 00:30:10.314
And I slap him really hard on the tit.

00:30:10.314 --> 00:30:12.186
TRAVIS: (yelping in pain)
(laughter)

00:30:12.186 --> 00:30:13.874
TRAVIS: Oh no, my nipple's hard, ow.

00:30:13.874 --> 00:30:15.844
SAM: What if Yasha used her--

00:30:15.844 --> 00:30:17.493
Oh, wait, do you have that sword anymore?

00:30:17.493 --> 00:30:19.394
ASHLEY: I gave it-- I-- no.

00:30:19.394 --> 00:30:20.681
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:23.034
ASHLEY: Kima and I did a switcheroo.

00:30:23.034 --> 00:30:25.924
TRAVIS: Well, I guess it's just the three of us.

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:29.404
Lucien disciples. We'll have to stick together, eh?

00:30:29.404 --> 00:30:33.284
SAM: Wait, can you three speak together in unison?

00:30:33.284 --> 00:30:34.117
LIAM: Splinter group, yeah?

00:30:34.117 --> 00:30:36.213
TRAVIS: At the same time. One, two, three.

00:30:36.213 --> 00:30:37.046
Maximum.
MARISHA: Tits.

00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:40.596
LIAM: (delayed) Maximum tits in alley.
MARISHA: Maximum tits.

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:44.035
It's maximum tits alley.

00:30:44.035 --> 00:30:48.306
SAM: The Somnovem is so hard to understand, their ways.

00:30:48.306 --> 00:30:50.374
TRAVIS: Takes a lot of training.

00:30:50.374 --> 00:30:52.164
SAM: Maximum tits?
TRAVIS: Yup.

00:30:52.164 --> 00:30:53.157
LIAM: Maximum tits alley.

00:30:53.157 --> 00:30:55.244
(laughter)

00:30:55.244 --> 00:30:56.564
MARISHA: My favorite alley.
TRAVIS: If you play it backwards,

00:30:56.564 --> 00:30:58.674
it'll all make sense. (laughs)

00:30:58.674 --> 00:31:00.206
LIAM: History of the slums of Rexxentrum.

00:31:00.206 --> 00:31:03.054
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs)

00:31:03.054 --> 00:31:05.207
LIAM: (gruff, cockney) Cor, you want
to go out with the maximum tits?

00:31:05.207 --> 00:31:06.198
Yeah!

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:08.674
(laughter)

00:31:08.674 --> 00:31:09.976
TRAVIS: Cool. Cool.

00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:11.687
LAURA: How do we get that-- what does it even do?

00:31:11.687 --> 00:31:14.804
How do we get that thing off of you?

00:31:14.804 --> 00:31:15.687
TRAVIS: Divination.

00:31:16.804 --> 00:31:19.934
They can follow.

00:31:19.934 --> 00:31:22.287
LIAM: So it's the same plan for more reasons.

00:31:23.734 --> 00:31:25.944
TALIESIN: Oh man, we need to get rid of that, or else--

00:31:25.944 --> 00:31:27.554
Well, no.
LIAM: Well, we keep trying.

00:31:27.554 --> 00:31:28.387
Maybe...

00:31:29.694 --> 00:31:30.537
Are you able to?

00:31:31.694 --> 00:31:33.066
LAURA: I can Dispel Magic.

00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:34.254
SAM: Want to give it a shot?

00:31:34.254 --> 00:31:36.124
You might have to touch Fjord's chest, though.

00:31:36.124 --> 00:31:37.446
LIAM: Slap him really hard in the tit.

00:31:37.446 --> 00:31:39.921
LAURA: Oh no, what am I going to do?

00:31:39.921 --> 00:31:42.304
SAM: Yasha, maybe spread your wings,

00:31:42.304 --> 00:31:44.474
give them a little privacy?

00:31:44.474 --> 00:31:45.332
ASHLEY: No!

00:31:45.332 --> 00:31:47.145
(laughter)

00:31:47.145 --> 00:31:48.943
SAM: Like a changing curtain.

00:31:48.943 --> 00:31:52.307
ASHLEY: I'll open my jacket because I'm big,

00:31:52.307 --> 00:31:53.794
and I'll just cover them.

00:31:53.794 --> 00:31:54.627
SAM: That's nice.

00:31:54.627 --> 00:31:55.821
ASHLEY: I want to save them.
TRAVIS: I don't think we need that.

00:31:55.821 --> 00:31:57.384
I'm already no shirt on.

00:31:57.384 --> 00:31:58.750
Just standing here.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.344
SAM: She's going to be up there doing things.

00:32:00.344 --> 00:32:05.344
LAURA: I'm going to cast it at 4th-level.

00:32:05.348 --> 00:32:06.414
MATT: 4th-level? Okay.
LAURA: Should I do it

00:32:06.414 --> 00:32:08.244
higher than that?

00:32:08.244 --> 00:32:09.077
SAM: Why waste it on Fjord?

00:32:09.077 --> 00:32:10.827
TRAVIS: It's just a burned sigil into my chest.

00:32:10.827 --> 00:32:12.512
I mean, don't worry too much about it.

00:32:12.512 --> 00:32:14.762
LAURA: I don't know how these things work. I'm just asking.

00:32:14.762 --> 00:32:16.644
LIAM: Well, we don't know how strong

00:32:16.644 --> 00:32:18.804
the forces are we're dealing with.

00:32:18.804 --> 00:32:19.985
I slap him in the tit again.

00:32:19.985 --> 00:32:21.625
MATT: (laughs)
TRAVIS: (yelps)

00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:23.005
SAM: Magical tit!

00:32:23.005 --> 00:32:24.743
(laughter)

00:32:24.743 --> 00:32:26.664
TRAVIS: Gah! My hands are cold.

00:32:26.664 --> 00:32:27.944
LIAM: Okay, I loosened him up for you.

00:32:27.944 --> 00:32:29.144
Give it a shot.
LAURA: Okay.

00:32:30.203 --> 00:32:32.184
LIAM: Get the blood flowing.

00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:33.494
LAURA: Both tits.

00:32:33.494 --> 00:32:34.327
TRAVIS: Slap or place?

00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:36.824
LAURA: No, just place.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:32:36.824 --> 00:32:38.062
MATT: At 4th-level, you said?

00:32:38.062 --> 00:32:39.611
LAURA: Huh? At 4th-level.

00:32:39.611 --> 00:32:42.194
MATT: Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier, please.

00:32:44.914 --> 00:32:47.527
TALIESIN: I see you doing this, I'm
going to be done with this shit.

00:32:49.586 --> 00:32:51.416
LAURA: Oh, come on!

00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:52.954
Why?!

00:32:52.954 --> 00:32:53.789
TALIESIN: Really?

00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:55.098
LAURA: It's a one.

00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:56.689
MATT: Aw!

00:32:57.994 --> 00:33:00.447
SAM: Minimum tit.
LIAM: Minimum.

00:33:00.447 --> 00:33:01.984
MARISHA: Minimum tits.

00:33:01.984 --> 00:33:04.424
LAURA: As she places her hands on your chest,

00:33:04.424 --> 00:33:05.344
even as she tried to warm them up,

00:33:05.344 --> 00:33:06.317
they're still pretty cold.

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:07.624
TRAVIS: Pecs! My pecs!

00:33:07.624 --> 00:33:10.595
My rock hard fucking pecs!

00:33:10.595 --> 00:33:12.564
LIAM: Minimum tit lane.

00:33:12.564 --> 00:33:13.977
MATT: On your chest.
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:33:15.844 --> 00:33:18.934
MATT: You feel that that sigil begin to warm and warm

00:33:18.934 --> 00:33:21.884
and then burn hot, hot!

00:33:21.884 --> 00:33:23.684
Oh, that actually hurts a lot.

00:33:23.684 --> 00:33:25.004
TRAVIS: Ah!

00:33:25.004 --> 00:33:27.774
MATT: And you pull away for a moment

00:33:27.774 --> 00:33:30.114
and you see it glowing brightly.

00:33:30.114 --> 00:33:34.241
And then it returns untouched.

00:33:34.241 --> 00:33:35.717
LAURA: I'm sorry.

00:33:35.717 --> 00:33:36.944
TRAVIS: Did you get it?

00:33:36.944 --> 00:33:38.864
LAURA: No, it's still there.

00:33:38.864 --> 00:33:41.154
I guess Dispel Magic just doesn't work.

00:33:41.154 --> 00:33:43.274
SAM: That would be the conclusion that we would arrive to

00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:45.154
at this point, yes.

00:33:45.154 --> 00:33:46.594
TRAVIS: Feel like this is what the tattoos were like

00:33:46.594 --> 00:33:48.127
without any of the payoff.

00:33:49.844 --> 00:33:51.454
LIAM: One thing that I learned in my youth

00:33:51.454 --> 00:33:54.062
is that after a great deal of pain--

00:33:54.062 --> 00:33:56.293
Whack!
TRAVIS: (yelps)

00:33:56.293 --> 00:33:58.284
LIAM: Feels really good right afterwards.
TRAVIS: There's an outline now.

00:33:58.284 --> 00:33:59.524
MARISHA: It's just the endorphins.

00:33:59.524 --> 00:34:00.806
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Should sign that.

00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:03.844
ASHLEY: I could try to rub it out.

00:34:03.844 --> 00:34:06.204
Well, that didn't work with Beau, so...

00:34:06.204 --> 00:34:07.547
TRAVIS: How many hands do you need for that?

00:34:07.547 --> 00:34:08.604
TALIESIN: (wheezes)

00:34:08.604 --> 00:34:09.750
ASHLEY: I don't even need my hands.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.725
(laughter)

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.251
LIAM: This is a serious show.

00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:20.463
LAURA: Yeah, sorry.

00:34:20.463 --> 00:34:22.778
TRAVIS: Why don't I have Dispel Magic?

00:34:22.778 --> 00:34:24.124
TALIESIN: I didn't have the Dispel Magic up,

00:34:24.124 --> 00:34:27.763
but I hadn't finished selecting my spells, so I'm torn.

00:34:27.763 --> 00:34:29.726
TRAVIS: What if that spell doesn't even work? (laughs)

00:34:29.726 --> 00:34:32.624
LAURA: I mean, I feel like we would believe

00:34:32.624 --> 00:34:36.012
that it doesn't at this point with two of us trying it.

00:34:36.012 --> 00:34:37.044
LIAM: Let's go find that pillar

00:34:37.044 --> 00:34:37.894
in Eiselcross again.
TALIESIN: Did you look like

00:34:37.894 --> 00:34:39.407
you sucked at it, though, is the question.

00:34:39.407 --> 00:34:40.587
LAURA: Did I look like I sucked at it,

00:34:40.587 --> 00:34:42.707
or if I was really focusing?

00:34:42.707 --> 00:34:45.604
MARISHA: Is this a dispel thing or a restoration thing?

00:34:45.604 --> 00:34:46.794
TRAVIS: It's fine.

00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:49.484
If it's so he can see me, he's already going to be

00:34:49.484 --> 00:34:51.024
looking at us anyway through scrying.

00:34:51.024 --> 00:34:52.654
Maybe it just lets him know--

00:34:53.544 --> 00:34:55.944
TALIESIN: Exactly where we are.
TRAVIS: Yeah, or something.

00:34:55.944 --> 00:34:57.884
LAURA: Well, do you have Greater Restoration?

00:34:57.884 --> 00:35:00.191
Because, you know, we could try that.

00:35:00.191 --> 00:35:01.853
It does help with curses!

00:35:01.853 --> 00:35:03.809
Maybe it's like your curse.
TRAVIS: We're not wasting

00:35:03.809 --> 00:35:06.067
a Greater Restoration on this!

00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:08.894
SAM: On you? You're one of our teammates!

00:35:08.894 --> 00:35:09.727
Of course we're going to--

00:35:09.727 --> 00:35:10.891
TRAVIS: Well, I mean we're far away.

00:35:10.891 --> 00:35:13.724
LAURA: That was very kind of you, Veth.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.599
MARISHA: Oh god.

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:18.849
(giggling)

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.950
TRAVIS: So involved.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.033
(laughter)

00:35:24.414 --> 00:35:25.740
TRAVIS: We should go. We have things we have to do.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.694
LAURA: Yes, we have to buy things.

00:35:26.694 --> 00:35:28.614
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't think it would help with this.

00:35:28.614 --> 00:35:30.104
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: We got distracted

00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:31.614
by his rock hard pecs.

00:35:31.614 --> 00:35:33.486
TRAVIS: Thank you, Caleb!

00:35:33.486 --> 00:35:34.364
Pecs!

00:35:34.364 --> 00:35:35.374
LIAM: It was ironic.

00:35:35.374 --> 00:35:36.577
TALIESIN: His chest was a lot.

00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:38.664
I suppose.

00:35:38.664 --> 00:35:39.497
LIAM: Sure was.

00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:42.334
So we're going shopping.

00:35:42.334 --> 00:35:45.124
We're going to find my old school chums.

00:35:45.124 --> 00:35:47.487
Then we are going to travel to see your folks.

00:35:51.714 --> 00:35:53.124
TALIESIN: Feels important.

00:35:53.124 --> 00:35:54.724
SAM: Shopping for what?

00:35:54.724 --> 00:35:55.814
MARISHA: I'll talk to you later.

00:35:55.814 --> 00:35:59.134
TRAVIS: Just out of curiosity, I'm down to go.

00:35:59.134 --> 00:36:01.754
Could you give us any hint as to what you saw?

00:36:01.754 --> 00:36:05.224
Like, are we going to fight beasts or plants or...

00:36:06.154 --> 00:36:07.364
TALIESIN: I didn't see anything to fight.

00:36:07.364 --> 00:36:10.934
I just saw that perhaps--

00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:14.436
Saw that perhaps the corruption is more related

00:36:14.436 --> 00:36:16.670
than I thought it was and that I was hoping it wouldn't be,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:21.604
and that maybe that there is a reason to go.

00:36:21.604 --> 00:36:23.897
LAURA: What precisely did you see?

00:36:26.224 --> 00:36:28.627
TALIESIN: A forest in pain, a forest dying.

00:36:31.334 --> 00:36:32.734
It's been a while to be honest.

00:36:32.734 --> 00:36:33.567
Hours.

00:36:33.567 --> 00:36:35.974
TRAVIS: ♪ It's been a while! ♪
MATT: (laughs)

00:36:35.974 --> 00:36:39.624
MARISHA: Does it feel worse than how you left The Grove?

00:36:39.624 --> 00:36:42.374
TALIESIN: Feels more acute.

00:36:42.374 --> 00:36:43.704
It feels very specific.

00:36:43.704 --> 00:36:45.997
It feels like what we saw.

00:36:45.997 --> 00:36:47.127
LAURA: This seems dire.

00:36:48.544 --> 00:36:52.564
ASHLEY: Do you feel like it's a result of what we did?

00:36:52.564 --> 00:36:53.854
TALIESIN: I don't-- I don't know.

00:36:53.854 --> 00:36:55.794
I don't think so, but

00:36:58.114 --> 00:37:00.194
I'm choosing to be hopeful about it

00:37:00.194 --> 00:37:04.234
and think that if somehow the Grove has combated

00:37:04.234 --> 00:37:07.564
this effect for so long, even if it has been

00:37:07.564 --> 00:37:11.467
slowly losing that battle until recently, that maybe,

00:37:13.614 --> 00:37:15.344
I don't know, there's maybe something to be gained

00:37:15.344 --> 00:37:18.734
by seeing this battlefield.

00:37:18.734 --> 00:37:20.444
MATT: Make an insight check for me.

00:37:20.444 --> 00:37:24.142
This is a general insight into the dream itself and the--

00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:25.534
SAM: Self insight?

00:37:26.634 --> 00:37:27.694
MATT: The imagery.

00:37:27.694 --> 00:37:29.574
TALIESIN: 24.

00:37:29.574 --> 00:37:30.407
MATT: Not bad.

00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:35.147
You know not of the status of The Grove.

00:37:39.184 --> 00:37:40.254
There were threads

00:37:40.254 --> 00:37:45.254
that seemed to connect elements of the Savalirwood

00:37:47.094 --> 00:37:50.067
to things that you saw in the ruins in Eiselcross.

00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:54.574
The imagery, the transformation of the landscape

00:37:54.574 --> 00:37:56.264
mimic the transformation to that

00:37:56.264 --> 00:38:00.674
of the hungry floating city of Cognouza itself.

00:38:00.674 --> 00:38:03.554
The ground turning into teeth and tongues.

00:38:03.554 --> 00:38:05.834
The trees becoming limbs.

00:38:05.834 --> 00:38:09.134
And buildings, architecture, and flesh

00:38:09.134 --> 00:38:12.227
merging, swirling, twisting, consuming.

00:38:14.704 --> 00:38:18.117
If that were happening now, that would be awful.

00:38:19.704 --> 00:38:21.437
Maybe it was a premonition.

00:38:22.514 --> 00:38:27.514
Maybe it was the importance of what path you're on

00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:30.527
or what's at stake should you fail.

00:38:31.484 --> 00:38:33.212
It's hard to tell.

00:38:33.212 --> 00:38:34.662
TALIESIN: Just-- just a--

00:38:35.794 --> 00:38:37.544
Wow, this is what two weeks does.

00:38:40.444 --> 00:38:41.464
Would it be possible

00:38:41.464 --> 00:38:45.814
just to check in really quickly to see?

00:38:45.814 --> 00:38:49.254
I know that messages are thin.

00:38:49.254 --> 00:38:51.314
LAURA: Oh sure, I can Scry on your sister.

00:38:51.314 --> 00:38:52.804
TALIESIN: Or just a...

00:38:52.804 --> 00:38:54.964
LAURA: I've never been there, so I can't--

00:38:54.964 --> 00:38:57.406
TALIESIN: Talk or--?
LAURA: I've never been to your home.

00:38:57.406 --> 00:38:58.409
Oh, send a message to them!

00:38:58.409 --> 00:39:00.052
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a message.

00:39:00.052 --> 00:39:01.774
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah, I can send a message.

00:39:01.774 --> 00:39:02.607
Of course.

00:39:03.794 --> 00:39:05.644
TALIESIN: Do you have a favorite or should I?

00:39:06.794 --> 00:39:08.944
LAURA: You just tell me who you want to talk to.

00:39:12.084 --> 00:39:13.127
TALIESIN: Let's talk to Cornelius.

00:39:13.127 --> 00:39:15.096
Let's talk to Dad.

00:39:15.096 --> 00:39:16.814
LAURA: Have I met Cornelius?

00:39:16.814 --> 00:39:18.164
TALIESIN: You've met them all.

00:39:18.164 --> 00:39:20.114
LAURA: I did meet Cornelius? Okay.

00:39:20.114 --> 00:39:22.274
MATT: You met the whole Clay family.

00:39:22.274 --> 00:39:23.154
MARISHA: There was like five of them.

00:39:23.154 --> 00:39:24.724
TALIESIN: I got a lot of them. Yeah.

00:39:24.724 --> 00:39:26.285
TRAVIS: Shocker.
MATT: At the lagoon

00:39:26.285 --> 00:39:28.625
after all the statues were found around...

00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:30.384
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:39:30.384 --> 00:39:32.574
All right, I'm going to send a message to Cornelius.

00:39:32.574 --> 00:39:34.224
What would you like me to say?

00:39:34.224 --> 00:39:35.144
TALIESIN: Just...

00:39:38.104 --> 00:39:40.044
I'm coming home. We're coming home.

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:43.844
Things have been strange,

00:39:43.844 --> 00:39:45.964
and is everything all right?

00:39:45.964 --> 00:39:48.264
Has there been any change?

00:39:48.264 --> 00:39:49.487
Are things holding?

00:39:50.324 --> 00:39:51.834
LAURA: Okay.

00:39:51.834 --> 00:39:54.744
Okay. I'm going to send a message to Cornelius.

00:39:54.744 --> 00:39:57.364
TRAVIS: That was 22 words.

00:39:57.364 --> 00:40:00.404
LAURA: Wow. I'll give it some flair.

00:40:00.404 --> 00:40:03.131
(laughter)

00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:05.163
ASHLEY: Take that, I'll make it better.
SAM: Hey!

00:40:05.163 --> 00:40:07.746
MATT: Put a little stank on it.
MARISHA: Can't remember three words.

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:11.815
LAURA: I already forgot what you wanted to say.

00:40:11.815 --> 00:40:13.104
(laughter)

00:40:13.104 --> 00:40:15.324
Don't! That doesn't count!
I haven't sent the message yet.

00:40:15.324 --> 00:40:16.904
Stop it!

00:40:16.904 --> 00:40:18.975
I'm sending the message now.

00:40:20.124 --> 00:40:21.527
Cornelius.

00:40:24.134 --> 00:40:25.397
Caduceus here.

00:40:27.084 --> 00:40:30.497
We've been doing things, creepy shit.

00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:32.736
(laughter)

00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:33.569
TALIESIN: Is everything--

00:40:33.569 --> 00:40:35.675
SAM: Where's the punctuation in that sentence?

00:40:35.675 --> 00:40:37.812
ASHLEY: "Doing things creepy shit."

00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:39.721
(laughter)

00:40:39.721 --> 00:40:40.555
MARISHA: Where are we?

00:40:40.555 --> 00:40:42.213
(laughter)

00:40:42.213 --> 00:40:43.200
ASHLEY: Stop clubbing baby seals.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.809
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh man.

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:46.381
(laughter)

00:40:46.381 --> 00:40:48.023
MATT: Sounds like you're trying to tell his parents

00:40:48.023 --> 00:40:51.370
you're getting involved with their son there.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.327
(laughter)

00:40:53.327 --> 00:40:55.264
LAURA: Heading back.

00:40:55.264 --> 00:40:57.094
How are things there?

00:40:57.094 --> 00:40:58.375
Creepy shit, too?

00:40:59.364 --> 00:41:01.597
How's the woods?

00:41:05.084 --> 00:41:06.942
Let me know, please.

00:41:06.942 --> 00:41:08.874
(laughter)

00:41:08.874 --> 00:41:10.561
LIAM: A lot of umlauts in that message.

00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:11.600
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.440
Yeah, a lot! (laughs)

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.440
(laughter)

00:41:18.524 --> 00:41:20.474
ASHLEY: That's amazing.

00:41:20.474 --> 00:41:22.067
LIAM: (strangely) How are the woods?

00:41:22.067 --> 00:41:25.601
(laughter)

00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:26.497
SAM: Heading back?

00:41:28.284 --> 00:41:30.064
What does that even mean?

00:41:30.064 --> 00:41:32.041
LAURA: I should've just gone with what he said.

00:41:32.041 --> 00:41:34.261
MARISHA: "We've been doing creepy shit, too"?

00:41:34.261 --> 00:41:36.511
(laughter)

00:41:37.764 --> 00:41:40.497
MATT: (as Cornelius) "Well, hello!

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:42.488
"And good morning!

00:41:44.574 --> 00:41:48.877
"Not a lot of <i>new</i> creepy stuff.

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:52.197
"Woods are fine.

00:41:54.204 --> 00:41:55.479
"Dreams have been weird."

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.520
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: Oh.

00:41:58.863 --> 00:42:00.457
MATT: "Wild Mother, watch us."

00:42:05.084 --> 00:42:07.214
LAURA: He was really concise with his words.

00:42:07.214 --> 00:42:08.804
I'm impressed.

00:42:08.804 --> 00:42:10.264
Yeah.
TALIESIN: Why I picked him.

00:42:10.264 --> 00:42:12.894
LAURA: I let you know what he said.

00:42:12.894 --> 00:42:14.434
Dreams, huh?

00:42:14.434 --> 00:42:16.006
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:42:16.006 --> 00:42:20.024
TRAVIS: Have you guys tried to
make anything with your minds yet?

00:42:20.024 --> 00:42:21.714
Or to make anything while you're dreaming?

00:42:21.714 --> 00:42:23.197
MARISHA: I've thought about it.

00:42:24.634 --> 00:42:28.034
I just don't, I feel like we need to talk about that.

00:42:28.034 --> 00:42:30.364
TALIESIN: Isn't technically just using your hands

00:42:30.364 --> 00:42:31.794
making things with your mind?

00:42:31.794 --> 00:42:34.269
MARISHA: Well, I mentioned last night that maybe

00:42:36.244 --> 00:42:39.244
there is a power here that we can harness.

00:42:39.244 --> 00:42:41.474
LIAM: I'm trying to actualize or manifest a hat

00:42:41.474 --> 00:42:42.524
on Beauregard's head.

00:42:43.464 --> 00:42:44.424
MARISHA: What kind of hat?

00:42:44.424 --> 00:42:45.304
LIAM: Like a Napoleon hat.

00:42:45.304 --> 00:42:46.723
MARISHA: Make it good.

00:42:46.723 --> 00:42:47.556
LIAM: Big feather.

00:42:47.556 --> 00:42:48.435
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:42:48.435 --> 00:42:50.715
TALIESIN: Are you just trying to
stare really hard 'til it hurts?

00:42:50.715 --> 00:42:52.965
LIAM: (groans)
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:42:54.024 --> 00:42:56.874
LAURA: I'm going to take out my paints
and draw a Napoleon hat.

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:58.721
LIAM: Damn it.
MARISHA: I help Caleb--

00:42:58.721 --> 00:42:59.694
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

00:42:59.694 --> 00:43:00.604
LAURA: Okay.

00:43:00.604 --> 00:43:03.784
MARISHA: -- really think about the Napoleon hat.

00:43:03.784 --> 00:43:06.385
LIAM: I'm staring right at her while I do this.

00:43:06.385 --> 00:43:07.834
LAURA: 15.

00:43:07.834 --> 00:43:09.207
MARISHA: We will manifest a hat.

00:43:10.634 --> 00:43:12.584
We will manifest a hat.

00:43:12.584 --> 00:43:13.494
TRAVIS: Chant it together.

00:43:13.494 --> 00:43:14.399
MATT: You watch as very--

00:43:14.399 --> 00:43:15.232
LAURA: Close your eyes!

00:43:15.232 --> 00:43:17.034
Close your eyes. Think a bit harder.

00:43:17.034 --> 00:43:19.184
LIAM: But I feel like if I use my eyes.

00:43:19.184 --> 00:43:20.017
SAM: Mage Hand!

00:43:20.964 --> 00:43:22.244
MARISHA: Manifest a hat.

00:43:22.244 --> 00:43:23.634
LIAM: I'm thinking of Easter Sunday.

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:26.504
MATT: You watch as gingerly, out of nowhere, it seems,

00:43:26.504 --> 00:43:29.454
this cartoony Napoleon hat,

00:43:29.454 --> 00:43:31.945
you know, the great Steve Napoleon of Wildemount--

00:43:31.945 --> 00:43:33.898
(laughter)

00:43:33.898 --> 00:43:38.284
MATT: -- just drifts down out of frame of your vision

00:43:38.284 --> 00:43:41.094
and gently comes to rest at an awkward cocked angle

00:43:41.094 --> 00:43:41.927
onto Beau's head.

00:43:41.927 --> 00:43:44.134
LIAM: Well, we have done it.

00:43:44.134 --> 00:43:47.377
The power of the Somnovem knows no bounds.

00:43:48.654 --> 00:43:49.654
Congratulations,

00:43:49.654 --> 00:43:52.734
and welcome to the Eyes of Nine, Beauregard Lionett.

00:43:52.734 --> 00:43:54.244
MARISHA: It's made of paper.

00:43:54.244 --> 00:43:56.971
LAURA: No, it's not! It's made of actual hat stuff!

00:43:56.971 --> 00:43:59.304
(laughter)

00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:00.137
SAM: Magical paint.

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:02.284
LAURA: Yeah, I made it out of my magic paints.

00:44:02.284 --> 00:44:03.274
I mean, I didn't make it.

00:44:03.274 --> 00:44:05.284
I'm saying he made it out of magical--

00:44:05.284 --> 00:44:06.537
It's real hat stuff.

00:44:06.537 --> 00:44:08.507
TALIESIN: The stuff that hats are made of.

00:44:08.507 --> 00:44:10.107
TRAVIS: Fuck your D&amp;D characters' names.

00:44:10.107 --> 00:44:11.938
Steve Napoleon in this bitch.

00:44:11.938 --> 00:44:13.802
(laughter)

00:44:13.802 --> 00:44:16.775
MARISHA: If someone's not Steve Napoleon in campaign three.

00:44:16.775 --> 00:44:18.484
(laughter)

00:44:18.484 --> 00:44:22.833
LIAM: I feel like we should move forward with our plans.

00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:25.974
TRAVIS: (laughs) At some point this morning. (laughs)

00:44:25.974 --> 00:44:26.807
LAURA: Yeah.

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:30.494
ASHLEY: You have an eye on your neck? Where--?

00:44:30.494 --> 00:44:31.564
LIAM: No, it's back here.

00:44:31.564 --> 00:44:34.344
SAM: Oh yeah, with your angel blood maybe you could...

00:44:34.344 --> 00:44:36.524
ASHLEY: I want to just flick it.

00:44:36.524 --> 00:44:37.515
SAM: Oh, flick it.

00:44:37.515 --> 00:44:41.329
ASHLEY: And just see if it gets mad.

00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:42.714
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: It's a stupid thing to do,

00:44:42.714 --> 00:44:46.274
but just to see if there's any response to...

00:44:46.274 --> 00:44:47.585
TALIESIN: I'd be mad if you flicked me in the eye.

00:44:47.585 --> 00:44:50.022
ASHLEY: Agitating it.
LIAM: Are you flicking it?

00:44:50.022 --> 00:44:51.881
ASHLEY: Do you want--?
LIAM: I'm subtracting one hit point.

00:44:51.881 --> 00:44:53.744
(laughter)

00:44:53.744 --> 00:44:55.420
SAM: She's raging.
ASHLEY: If I just tap on it.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.253
MATT: Whack!

00:44:57.964 --> 00:44:58.797
A steady hit.

00:44:59.684 --> 00:45:01.834
Likely a small welt will rise in time,

00:45:01.834 --> 00:45:02.844
but it doesn't seem to react.

00:45:02.844 --> 00:45:04.769
It's odd, and much like with Mollymauk

00:45:04.769 --> 00:45:05.624
in the time that you knew him,

00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:08.364
these tattoos, they look like tattoos.

00:45:08.364 --> 00:45:10.594
At a glance, it looks like ink, it bends with the skin.

00:45:10.594 --> 00:45:11.932
It's just an image.

00:45:13.267 --> 00:45:16.457
So it doesn't have any difference in physicality or texture,

00:45:16.457 --> 00:45:20.358
other than the fact that in a close look, it is smooth.

00:45:20.358 --> 00:45:22.174
There's no pores.

00:45:22.174 --> 00:45:25.460
Just where the eye is,
it's just a smooth surface.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.885
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Can I--

00:45:26.885 --> 00:45:30.374
Give me one of your not-creepy daggers,
just a regular dagger.

00:45:30.374 --> 00:45:33.304
SAM: They were all stolen,
but I'll give you a crossbow bolt.

00:45:33.304 --> 00:45:34.314
LAURA: Okay.

00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:35.374
I'm going to take a crossbow bolt

00:45:35.374 --> 00:45:37.674
and poke my finger until it bleeds.

00:45:37.674 --> 00:45:38.507
MATT: Okay.

00:45:38.507 --> 00:45:40.694
LAURA: Then I go over to the eye and smudge it on the eye.

00:45:41.984 --> 00:45:43.464
MATT: It smudges onto it.

00:45:43.464 --> 00:45:44.615
LAURA: Oh.

00:45:44.615 --> 00:45:46.164
MARISHA: That was a good idea.
LAURA: Well, sorry.

00:45:46.164 --> 00:45:47.644
That's gross now.

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:48.477
I thought it would do something.

00:45:48.477 --> 00:45:50.633
TRAVIS: Do you feel more powerful?

00:45:50.633 --> 00:45:52.294
TALIESIN: Or do you feel sticky? I don't know.

00:45:52.294 --> 00:45:54.949
LIAM: (sighs) I still just feel awkward.

00:45:55.944 --> 00:45:56.777
LAURA: Yeah.

00:45:56.777 --> 00:45:58.294
LIAM: So that plan.

00:45:58.294 --> 00:45:59.127
MARISHA: Okay.

00:45:59.127 --> 00:46:02.101
So we know we're going to talk to your--

00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:03.138
(clears throat)

00:46:03.138 --> 00:46:05.114
(laughter)

00:46:05.114 --> 00:46:07.091
LIAM: She's changing!
TRAVIS: Kill her!

00:46:07.091 --> 00:46:08.034
Kill her!

00:46:08.034 --> 00:46:08.867
MARISHA: Roll initiative!

00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:11.094
(laughter)

00:46:11.964 --> 00:46:13.593
ASHLEY: No!

00:46:13.593 --> 00:46:16.976
MARISHA: Our date! So close!

00:46:16.976 --> 00:46:19.274
SAM: We've mentioned shopping a few times.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:19.274 --> 00:46:20.334
SAM: What are we shopping for?

00:46:20.334 --> 00:46:21.684
LAURA: Well, you need more crossbow bolts.

00:46:21.684 --> 00:46:23.304
SAM: Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure.

00:46:23.304 --> 00:46:24.137
LIAM: I need some supplies.

00:46:24.137 --> 00:46:26.534
LAURA: I want to get a jeweled chalice,

00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:31.064
so in case we have to cast Heroes' Feast, then we can.

00:46:31.064 --> 00:46:33.734
SAM: Do you have what you need to revive people and stuff?

00:46:33.734 --> 00:46:35.101
LAURA: I got lots of diamonds.

00:46:35.101 --> 00:46:36.386
SAM: Okay.

00:46:36.386 --> 00:46:39.421
MARISHA: How many healing potions did we get from--

00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:40.654
TALIESIN: Powdered.
MARISHA: Huh?

00:46:40.654 --> 00:46:42.104
LIAM: We got two from Yussa.

00:46:42.104 --> 00:46:44.704
SAM: Where are the new healing potions?

00:46:44.704 --> 00:46:46.934
TRAVIS: Don't look at me. I'm not holding any shit anymore.

00:46:46.934 --> 00:46:49.494
LAURA: I would like one, because I had to down one.

00:46:49.494 --> 00:46:51.874
SAM: I would like one as well because I had to drink one.

00:46:51.874 --> 00:46:53.651
LAURA: Okay, yeah. You both can have a healing potion.

00:46:53.651 --> 00:46:55.544
SAM: Are they greater, regular or--

00:46:55.544 --> 00:46:56.984
LAURA: They were just regular, right?

00:46:56.984 --> 00:46:58.424
TALIESIN: Diet.

00:46:58.424 --> 00:47:01.404
TRAVIS: No, they were superior.
MARISHA: Superior, right?

00:47:01.404 --> 00:47:02.884
SAM: Is that this?

00:47:02.884 --> 00:47:04.737
MATT: No, superior is in the other box.

00:47:04.737 --> 00:47:06.564
SAM: Ooh, the huge ones?

00:47:06.564 --> 00:47:07.397
MATT: A little bit larger, yeah.

00:47:07.397 --> 00:47:08.474
TRAVIS: Big honkin' turds of things.

00:47:08.474 --> 00:47:11.419
MARISHA: So what is that? 5d4?

00:47:12.341 --> 00:47:14.014
MATT: That's 4d4 plus four.

00:47:14.014 --> 00:47:14.847
MARISHA: But those are five.

00:47:14.847 --> 00:47:16.704
MATT: Those are 8d4 plus eight.

00:47:16.704 --> 00:47:17.984
SAM: Ooh!

00:47:17.984 --> 00:47:19.411
TALIESIN: That's a pick me up.

00:47:19.411 --> 00:47:20.309
You need that.

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:21.972
TRAVIS: Damn, really?

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:23.964
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:47:23.964 --> 00:47:25.874
SAM: While we're talking equipment:

00:47:25.874 --> 00:47:28.364
(stilted) Does anyone have any studded leather armor

00:47:28.364 --> 00:47:29.564
they want to give me?

00:47:29.564 --> 00:47:30.694
TRAVIS: (stilted) Oh yes, I do!

00:47:30.694 --> 00:47:31.527
SAM: (stilted) Oh great!

00:47:31.527 --> 00:47:33.164
TRAVIS: (stilted) I actually have a spare that's over here.

00:47:33.164 --> 00:47:33.997
Take this and enjoy.

00:47:33.997 --> 00:47:34.830
SAM: Oh, thank you!

00:47:36.264 --> 00:47:37.164
LIAM: Talking logistics.

00:47:37.164 --> 00:47:39.874
So we're going to go to your family 100% tonight.

00:47:39.874 --> 00:47:44.377
To do that, that is the most difficult thing that I do.

00:47:45.614 --> 00:47:49.014
TALIESIN: Is there a Cobalt library that we can use instead

00:47:49.014 --> 00:47:51.494
if we can use a circle, someone to teleport us to them.

00:47:51.494 --> 00:47:54.034
LIAM: Is there a circle at your destination?

00:47:54.034 --> 00:47:54.867
TALIESIN: No.

00:47:54.867 --> 00:47:57.154
But wait, it is, well...

00:47:57.154 --> 00:47:59.034
MARISHA: How far away is it from here?

00:47:59.034 --> 00:48:00.264
TALIESIN: Far.
LAURA: It's far?

00:48:00.264 --> 00:48:01.607
TRAVIS: Far.

00:48:01.607 --> 00:48:02.724
MATT: As far as The Grove?

00:48:02.724 --> 00:48:04.685
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Rexxentrum? It's south of Rexxentrum.

00:48:04.685 --> 00:48:06.174
LAURA: It's in Xhorhas.

00:48:06.174 --> 00:48:07.404
I mean, it's in...

00:48:07.404 --> 00:48:08.724
MATT: It's north of Shadycreek Runs.

00:48:08.724 --> 00:48:12.894
So it's a few days' travel on foot or by horse.

00:48:12.894 --> 00:48:14.604
LAURA: Way in a different place than I thought it was.

00:48:14.604 --> 00:48:16.144
(laughs)

00:48:16.144 --> 00:48:18.667
MARISHA: And we have no quick means of bamfing?

00:48:19.564 --> 00:48:21.834
LIAM: Quick is with circles.

00:48:21.834 --> 00:48:24.307
And without a circle, it's my utmost,

00:48:25.524 --> 00:48:26.854
which we have to do.

00:48:26.854 --> 00:48:29.384
TALIESIN: There's no easy access to that,
other than the fact--

00:48:29.384 --> 00:48:32.569
It's technically a shrine, so I have to designate--

00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:34.894
MATT: You have to designate it.

00:48:34.894 --> 00:48:36.144
You have to designate it.

00:48:37.264 --> 00:48:39.054
Yeah, otherwise travel is going to be on foot

00:48:39.054 --> 00:48:40.624
or through magical means.

00:48:40.624 --> 00:48:43.254
LIAM: But that means that to talk to my friends

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:45.634
we are not meeting inside my home,

00:48:45.634 --> 00:48:47.994
we have to find a physical location here in town today.

00:48:47.994 --> 00:48:49.517
LAURA: Oh wait, hold on!

00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.494
Let me see, let me see,

00:48:51.494 --> 00:48:53.619
because I have a spell I could do

00:48:55.702 --> 00:48:56.596
that might--

00:48:56.596 --> 00:48:58.637
I got to see how long it takes to cast.

00:49:01.944 --> 00:49:03.869
It takes me an hour to cast it.

00:49:03.869 --> 00:49:04.784
SAM: That's okay.

00:49:04.784 --> 00:49:05.991
TALIESIN and LIAM: That's fine.
LAURA: But...

00:49:07.974 --> 00:49:10.127
I can create a temple.

00:49:11.124 --> 00:49:12.294
MARISHA: Whoa, what?
SAM: Excuse me?

00:49:12.294 --> 00:49:14.464
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's a thing.

00:49:14.464 --> 00:49:15.344
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:15.344 --> 00:49:16.294
LIAM: What do you mean?

00:49:17.234 --> 00:49:19.984
LAURA: Also, it's not quite as amazing as your tower,

00:49:19.984 --> 00:49:24.814
but it's a temple that is for the Traveler

00:49:24.814 --> 00:49:29.634
and it creates basically a world, also another door.

00:49:29.634 --> 00:49:30.504
LIAM: Similarly hidden?

00:49:30.504 --> 00:49:32.324
LAURA: Similarly, well...

00:49:33.434 --> 00:49:35.209
I think so. Let me see.

00:49:35.209 --> 00:49:36.557
MATT: The creation of this temple,

00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:40.514
as opposed to being a door that leads to a pocket dimension,

00:49:40.514 --> 00:49:42.714
you need the space to create the temple.

00:49:42.714 --> 00:49:43.730
LAURA: I need 120 feet.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.404
MATT: You need 120 feet because you create

00:49:45.404 --> 00:49:48.784
an actual physical temple for 24 hours.

00:49:48.784 --> 00:49:49.954
LAURA: I thought it was like a tower--

00:49:49.954 --> 00:49:51.620
Oh, never mind. That's totally different.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.945
LIAM: That's amazing.

00:49:52.945 --> 00:49:54.587
MARISHA: I mean, that's really cool.

00:49:57.114 --> 00:49:58.847
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: You have to show us some time.

00:49:58.847 --> 00:50:00.292
LAURA: Yeah, I've never done it.

00:50:00.292 --> 00:50:01.444
I would have to--

00:50:01.444 --> 00:50:03.524
I mean, I have to think about what I would want

00:50:03.524 --> 00:50:06.409
the way that you did the tower probably, huh?

00:50:07.484 --> 00:50:08.344
LIAM: Yes, please.

00:50:08.344 --> 00:50:10.837
LAURA: I'm going to start drawing schematics.

00:50:12.474 --> 00:50:17.474
TALIESIN: You also need a idol of the god that you're--

00:50:19.044 --> 00:50:22.157
LAURA: I've got enough idols of him, okay?

00:50:22.157 --> 00:50:23.154
Don't worry.

00:50:23.154 --> 00:50:25.284
LIAM: That's just a dick.
MARISHA: She has so many dicks.

00:50:25.284 --> 00:50:27.574
TALIESIN: Just needs to be a five-gold dick.

00:50:27.574 --> 00:50:29.733
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah.
SAM: Maximum dick.

00:50:29.733 --> 00:50:32.234
LAURA: I've got a 20-gold dick.

00:50:32.234 --> 00:50:33.414
I've got a 30-gold dick.

00:50:33.414 --> 00:50:34.668
I've got so many gold dicks.

00:50:34.668 --> 00:50:37.054
(laughter)

00:50:37.054 --> 00:50:40.534
MARISHA: A 30-gold dick and 30 gold dicks.

00:50:40.534 --> 00:50:42.484
SAM: All right, so where are we going to schedule

00:50:42.484 --> 00:50:43.794
this meeting with your friends?

00:50:43.794 --> 00:50:45.424
LAURA: We got to just figure that out on the fly.

00:50:45.424 --> 00:50:46.257
Let's get going.

00:50:46.257 --> 00:50:47.154
We got to start shopping.

00:50:47.154 --> 00:50:48.245
LIAM: Well, maybe talk to--

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:50.204
Maybe we should send them a message first.

00:50:50.204 --> 00:50:52.344
If they need to rearrange their plans.

00:50:52.344 --> 00:50:54.364
SAM: Anything to prevent us from leaving would be good.

00:50:54.364 --> 00:50:55.204
So yes.

00:50:55.204 --> 00:50:56.084
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.
LIAM: No, no, no.

00:50:56.084 --> 00:50:57.492
They-- it's-- (sighs)

00:50:57.492 --> 00:50:59.452
LAURA: Which one should I send it to?

00:50:59.452 --> 00:51:00.964
Eadwulf or to Astrid?

00:51:00.964 --> 00:51:02.614
SAM: Astrid 100%.

00:51:02.614 --> 00:51:05.124
LIAM: Astrid would be more likely, I think,

00:51:05.124 --> 00:51:07.011
to keep it on the down low.

00:51:08.392 --> 00:51:10.284
If she's going to.

00:51:10.284 --> 00:51:12.774
Wulf, I don't know.

00:51:12.774 --> 00:51:14.264
SAM: Say no more. He's a big brute.

00:51:14.264 --> 00:51:15.894
We hate him.
MARISHA: Is that a risk?

00:51:15.894 --> 00:51:16.914
If you're saying that,

00:51:16.914 --> 00:51:18.924
is there a risk in between now and then

00:51:18.924 --> 00:51:21.017
of them spilling their beans?

00:51:22.214 --> 00:51:25.356
Should we just try and grab them?

00:51:25.356 --> 00:51:26.347
TRAVIS: Yeah, is a heads-up better,

00:51:26.347 --> 00:51:28.114
or is it like, "Meet us in five minutes"?

00:51:28.114 --> 00:51:30.014
LIAM: Well, they're not going to have a...

00:51:30.874 --> 00:51:32.294
MARISHA: Maybe it's a, "Meet us in five minutes,"

00:51:32.294 --> 00:51:34.304
or "Are you available to chat?"

00:51:34.304 --> 00:51:36.434
SAM: Or, "We're outside. Come down and see us."

00:51:36.434 --> 00:51:37.704
MARISHA: Yeah, I like that.

00:51:37.704 --> 00:51:39.506
LIAM: "Outside and come down in five minutes"

00:51:39.506 --> 00:51:41.613
is in Trent's backyard.

00:51:43.043 --> 00:51:44.315
TRAVIS: It's all right; he can die, too.

00:51:45.364 --> 00:51:48.334
LAURA: Oh! No, that's a different city.

00:51:48.334 --> 00:51:49.511
SAM: Just send her a message and just say,

00:51:49.511 --> 00:51:51.614
"Hey, old friend in town here.

00:51:51.614 --> 00:51:53.174
"Why don't you meet us at the...

00:51:55.464 --> 00:51:57.184
"Grim Shelf Tavern."

00:51:57.184 --> 00:51:59.576
TRAVIS: Love it when Sam uses his notes.

00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:02.454
LAURA: The Grim Shelf Tavern.
SAM: Or the Stone Coffin Fighting Pit,

00:52:02.454 --> 00:52:05.177
because that would just be fun to go visit.

00:52:06.794 --> 00:52:07.627
LIAM: No.

00:52:09.855 --> 00:52:11.464
We meet them at the dance hall.

00:52:11.464 --> 00:52:12.664
LAURA: The dance hall?

00:52:12.664 --> 00:52:13.644
The dance hall?

00:52:13.644 --> 00:52:15.067
MAIRSHA: <i>The</i> dance hall?

00:52:15.954 --> 00:52:17.744
LAURA: The oops-stone dance hall.

00:52:17.744 --> 00:52:18.926
I'm going to send the message to Astrid.

00:52:18.926 --> 00:52:20.637
When should I tell her to meet us?

00:52:23.004 --> 00:52:23.837
SAM: Dusk.

00:52:25.364 --> 00:52:26.547
LIAM: Sure.
LAURA: Dusk.

00:52:29.174 --> 00:52:30.007
Hi.

00:52:34.274 --> 00:52:36.574
Caleb wants to talk to you.

00:52:36.574 --> 00:52:38.427
It's <i>important.</i>

00:52:39.594 --> 00:52:41.704
<i>Important.</i>

00:52:42.574 --> 00:52:46.657
Meet us at the dance hall at dusk.

00:52:47.924 --> 00:52:49.964
Tell nobody.

00:52:51.724 --> 00:52:56.360
Keep it secret from you-know-who.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.610
(giggling)

00:53:00.334 --> 00:53:01.560
LIAM: Well done.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.710
MATT: A brief moment before you get a response.

00:53:05.414 --> 00:53:06.247
"<i>Danke.</i>

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.473
"I'll be there.

00:53:09.524 --> 00:53:14.074
"Please tell Caleb, 'Thank you.'"

00:53:16.184 --> 00:53:17.017
That's all.

00:53:18.041 --> 00:53:21.504
She said <i>Danke</i>, she'll be there.

00:53:21.504 --> 00:53:23.371
And also to tell you, "Thank you."

00:53:24.214 --> 00:53:25.594
TALIESIN: Well, that's nice.

00:53:25.594 --> 00:53:27.474
ASHLEY: She's thanking you for the dance hall?

00:53:27.474 --> 00:53:28.724
What am I missing here?

00:53:28.724 --> 00:53:30.114
LAURA: What is she saying thank you for?

00:53:30.114 --> 00:53:31.914
Is she saying thank you because--

00:53:31.914 --> 00:53:33.454
SAM: She might've been saying thank you to you

00:53:33.454 --> 00:53:34.680
for passing along--
LAURA: No, no, no.

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.244
She said, "Tell Caleb 'thank you.'"

00:53:37.244 --> 00:53:38.644
MARISHA: Giving him another chance?

00:53:39.934 --> 00:53:41.364
LAURA: Maybe?

00:53:41.364 --> 00:53:42.495
MARISHA: No?

00:53:42.495 --> 00:53:43.364
LIAM: I don't know.

00:53:43.364 --> 00:53:45.104
LAURA: What if she's saying thank you

00:53:45.104 --> 00:53:46.234
because as soon as she sees us,

00:53:46.234 --> 00:53:47.334
they're going to be able to bring us in

00:53:47.334 --> 00:53:48.724
and it's going to give her

00:53:48.724 --> 00:53:51.514
the ability to rise up to the top?

00:53:51.514 --> 00:53:54.844
LIAM: Well, then perhaps you will all remain hidden

00:53:54.844 --> 00:53:55.677
and I will talk to her.

00:53:55.677 --> 00:53:56.714
SAM: Yes.

00:53:56.714 --> 00:53:57.804
LAURA: Okay.

00:53:57.804 --> 00:53:59.484
SAM: We'll form a perimeter.

00:53:59.484 --> 00:54:00.484
We'll stay in the shadows.

00:54:00.484 --> 00:54:02.004
Some of us will turn invisible.

00:54:02.004 --> 00:54:02.924
We'll watch.

00:54:02.924 --> 00:54:03.757
LAURA: Good idea.

00:54:05.594 --> 00:54:08.194
LIAM: Maybe one more of you in the hall.

00:54:08.194 --> 00:54:10.414
You know, since I have 87 hit points.

00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:11.853
MARISHA: Yeah, I think that's fine.

00:54:11.853 --> 00:54:12.864
LIAM: In disguise.

00:54:12.864 --> 00:54:14.964
TALIESIN: We can all be in disguise if we have to.

00:54:14.964 --> 00:54:16.786
SAM: Fuck it. It doesn't even really have to be you.

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:20.534
Can't you project a hologram of him or something?

00:54:20.534 --> 00:54:22.252
LAURA: I can project a hologram of me.

00:54:22.252 --> 00:54:23.169
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:54:24.274 --> 00:54:26.097
LIAM: You can't dance with hologram.

00:54:26.097 --> 00:54:29.313
LAURA: Ooh, I could disguise myself
and then project a holograph!

00:54:29.313 --> 00:54:30.874
Well, no.

00:54:30.874 --> 00:54:32.734
TALIESIN: I think just maybe spreading ourselves out

00:54:32.734 --> 00:54:33.567
amongst the hall.

00:54:33.567 --> 00:54:37.454
It's not they don't already know that you contacted.

00:54:37.454 --> 00:54:38.664
LAURA: Oh, right.

00:54:38.664 --> 00:54:40.304
TALIESIN: There wasn't a request to come alone.

00:54:40.304 --> 00:54:42.944
TRAVIS: We had Vess DeRogna show up, remember?

00:54:42.944 --> 00:54:44.214
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: She wasn't there.

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:45.904
SAM: So shopping then?

00:54:45.904 --> 00:54:47.554
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Shopping then dancing.

00:54:49.254 --> 00:54:50.724
MATT: All righty.

00:54:50.724 --> 00:54:52.874
So for the day in Rexxentrum, what are you shopping for?

00:54:52.874 --> 00:54:55.284
Who's looking for what?

00:54:55.284 --> 00:54:57.274
LIAM: Well, I need to find a place that sells gems

00:54:57.274 --> 00:54:59.814
and crystals and amber, specifically.

00:54:59.814 --> 00:55:00.714
MATT: Those are all fairly easy

00:55:00.714 --> 00:55:02.524
to procure here in Rexxentrum.
LAURA: -- for me.

00:55:02.524 --> 00:55:03.404
LIAM: Yeah?

00:55:03.404 --> 00:55:05.284
I have very little money.

00:55:05.284 --> 00:55:06.117
TRAVIS: You know what you could do?

00:55:06.117 --> 00:55:10.004
You could sell that ring I have. (laughs)

00:55:10.004 --> 00:55:11.501
LAURA: I'm not selling it, Fjord.

00:55:11.501 --> 00:55:14.904
TRAVIS: It's 5,000 gold pieces!

00:55:14.904 --> 00:55:15.737
LIAM: Not anymore.

00:55:17.054 --> 00:55:19.974
SAM: When they got away with all of our belongings,

00:55:19.974 --> 00:55:22.054
did they get our gold?

00:55:22.054 --> 00:55:27.054
Am I just carrying around thousands of pieces of gold on me?

00:55:27.324 --> 00:55:29.214
MARISHA: I split mine up into individual packages.

00:55:29.214 --> 00:55:31.934
MATT: You guys should keep
whatever gold is on you on yourself.

00:55:31.934 --> 00:55:34.224
Anything else would be in the bag of holding.

00:55:34.224 --> 00:55:35.057
TALIESIN: I keep all mine.

00:55:35.057 --> 00:55:37.366
MARISHA: We learned this lesson after Hupperdook.

00:55:37.366 --> 00:55:38.199
TRAVIS: I didn't keep anybody's gold.

00:55:38.199 --> 00:55:41.742
LIAM: I never have gold for
longer than 20 minutes, so I'm fine.

00:55:41.742 --> 00:55:42.994
MARISHA: That's true.
SAM: Oh, that's right.

00:55:43.944 --> 00:55:45.814
TALIESIN: Also, just in case we can find

00:55:45.814 --> 00:55:47.464
anything else magical that might help,

00:55:47.464 --> 00:55:51.104
it's always worth sweeping a magic shop.

00:55:51.104 --> 00:55:53.664
TRAVIS: Like a Ring of Ice Resistance.

00:55:53.664 --> 00:55:55.087
TALIESIN: That would be amazing.

00:55:55.087 --> 00:55:58.194
LIAM: Watch, we go straight to Hell once we buy that ring.

00:55:58.194 --> 00:55:59.644
MATT: I will say, for the purposes

00:55:59.644 --> 00:56:01.557
of the shopping trip narrative,

00:56:03.584 --> 00:56:05.004
similar to your last time here,

00:56:05.004 --> 00:56:08.754
most of the magical items have not yet returned

00:56:08.754 --> 00:56:11.315
since their wartime inscription.

00:56:12.274 --> 00:56:14.754
And the last time you did go to a magic shop here,

00:56:14.754 --> 00:56:15.587
you cleared them out of

00:56:15.587 --> 00:56:17.944
a lot of their lower end magical items as well.

00:56:17.944 --> 00:56:22.911
Many a celebone still remains within some of you.

00:56:22.911 --> 00:56:23.744
Many a celebone still remains within some of you.

00:56:24.664 --> 00:56:25.564
TALIESIN: Don't regret nothing.

00:56:25.564 --> 00:56:27.584
MATT: But yeah, gems are easy enough to procure

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:28.564
here in Rexxentrum specifically.

00:56:28.564 --> 00:56:31.464
It is the capital, and there are sections of the city

00:56:31.464 --> 00:56:32.904
that are filled to the brim

00:56:32.904 --> 00:56:37.454
with all manner of textile warehouses,

00:56:37.454 --> 00:56:40.912
and craft sales fronts, and carts,

00:56:40.912 --> 00:56:43.774
and stores of all kinds.

00:56:43.774 --> 00:56:46.234
So, I guess, say what you're looking for

00:56:46.234 --> 00:56:47.191
and I'll tell you if it's available

00:56:47.191 --> 00:56:48.644
and for what price you require.

00:56:48.644 --> 00:56:49.924
LIAM: Well, I'm looking for...

00:56:49.924 --> 00:56:52.804
Yussa gave me two or three pieces of amber.

00:56:52.804 --> 00:56:53.914
I'm struggling to remember.

00:56:53.914 --> 00:56:56.094
I think it was two.

00:56:56.094 --> 00:56:57.994
So I need five total.

00:56:57.994 --> 00:57:00.061
TALIESIN: I would like a forked to metal rod.

00:57:00.061 --> 00:57:02.154
250 gold forked metal rod

00:57:02.154 --> 00:57:06.454
attuned to this plane of existence would be smokin'.

00:57:06.454 --> 00:57:09.109
I say as Taliesin in Clay's voice.

00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:10.524
MATT: (laughs)

00:57:10.524 --> 00:57:12.424
TALIESIN: He would never say "smokin'"
and it came out of my mouth.

00:57:12.424 --> 00:57:13.913
(laughter)

00:57:13.913 --> 00:57:15.224
I want that stricken from the record.

00:57:15.224 --> 00:57:17.141
MATT: Fair enough. We can edit it out.

00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:18.632
TALIESIN: It's been a day.

00:57:19.824 --> 00:57:21.454
LIAM: So three pieces of amber for me.

00:57:21.454 --> 00:57:23.121
MATT: Okay. Yeah. You can definitely do that.

00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:24.694
Just reduce the cost.

00:57:24.694 --> 00:57:25.974
The amber's easy to find,

00:57:25.974 --> 00:57:27.834
comparison to some of the locations.

00:57:27.834 --> 00:57:30.876
It's not easy. It isn't like
they're available at every corner,

00:57:30.876 --> 00:57:32.814
but after an hour or so

00:57:32.814 --> 00:57:34.114
of traveling around and asking questions,

00:57:34.114 --> 00:57:35.514
you find a place that does have pieces

00:57:35.514 --> 00:57:36.654
that will work for your purposes.

00:57:36.654 --> 00:57:38.504
LIAM: Do you know how much it would cost?

00:57:39.784 --> 00:57:41.414
MATT: Well, for the pieces of amber that require for it,

00:57:41.414 --> 00:57:44.854
I'd say each chunk would be about 20 gold.

00:57:44.854 --> 00:57:46.254
So for the three of them it would be 60.

00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:47.087
LIAM: Okay.

00:57:48.644 --> 00:57:50.225
MATT: For the purity and size that you need.

00:57:50.225 --> 00:57:51.058
LIAM: Okay.

00:57:52.394 --> 00:57:54.857
MATT: Your rod that is attuned can also be found.

00:57:56.294 --> 00:57:58.804
Though the attunement process of it

00:57:58.804 --> 00:58:01.184
is going to be partially a combination

00:58:01.184 --> 00:58:04.444
of you working with Caleb to do so.

00:58:04.444 --> 00:58:06.594
The rod, the actual requisite materials

00:58:06.594 --> 00:58:08.674
and construction is very specific.

00:58:08.674 --> 00:58:10.834
It doesn't come pre-attuned.

00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:12.034
But both of you working together

00:58:12.034 --> 00:58:13.444
would be able to attune it to this plane,

00:58:13.444 --> 00:58:15.864
since it's the one you're most familiar with.

00:58:15.864 --> 00:58:17.080
TALIESIN: The only other thing is

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.138
I'd like a little more saffron

00:58:19.138 --> 00:58:22.292
for my True Sight,

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.930
if I could get some.

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:26.347
TRAVIS: Saffron's good.

00:58:27.894 --> 00:58:31.194
TALIESIN: Where'd it go? I've opened too many things.

00:58:34.534 --> 00:58:37.674
Let's get three of them, so that's another 75gp.

00:58:37.674 --> 00:58:38.744
MATT: Okay.

00:58:38.744 --> 00:58:40.102
Go ahead and mark that off and

00:58:40.102 --> 00:58:41.574
make sure you mark that in your inventory.

00:58:41.574 --> 00:58:45.144
LAURA: Can I get incense worth 250 gold

00:58:45.144 --> 00:58:49.050
and four ivory strips worth 50 gold.

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:51.933
Each! Holy shit.

00:58:51.933 --> 00:58:52.774
TALIESIN: Do you have enough diamonds

00:58:52.774 --> 00:58:54.664
and diamond powder and everything?

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:55.497
LAURA: So that's...

00:58:56.664 --> 00:58:58.846
LAURA: 450 gold.
MARISHA: I'm also pretty--

00:58:58.846 --> 00:59:00.662
TRAVIS: Caleb.
MARISHA: -- flush in cash

00:59:00.662 --> 00:59:02.584
if I need to help fund the clerics.

00:59:02.584 --> 00:59:04.384
LAURA: I think it might be good to--

00:59:04.384 --> 00:59:05.314
MARISHA: Fund the clerics.
LAURA: Because I don't have

00:59:05.314 --> 00:59:07.891
enough money to buy a jeweled chalice,

00:59:07.891 --> 00:59:09.734
worth at least 1000 gold, though.

00:59:09.734 --> 00:59:11.524
MARISHA: Girl, I got you.

00:59:11.524 --> 00:59:12.654
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: I'm going to buy Jester

00:59:12.654 --> 00:59:14.544
that jeweled chalice.

00:59:14.544 --> 00:59:15.417
MATT: Okay.

00:59:15.417 --> 00:59:16.634
LIAM: And, I forgot--

00:59:16.634 --> 00:59:17.644
MARISHA: Sugar mama.

00:59:17.644 --> 00:59:19.944
LIAM: I wanted to get a couple of pearls

00:59:19.944 --> 00:59:22.394
worth 100 gold each, if possible.

00:59:22.394 --> 00:59:23.714
MATT: Yeah, those can be found as well.

00:59:23.714 --> 00:59:24.794
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:29.364
You are in the center of the Empire's influence

00:59:29.364 --> 00:59:31.444
and there are many, many different avenues of trade

00:59:31.444 --> 00:59:33.764
in and out of the city, so of all places

00:59:33.764 --> 00:59:35.734
where you're looking for more specific objects,

00:59:35.734 --> 00:59:37.004
here'd be some of the easiest

00:59:37.004 --> 00:59:37.844
to find, so.
LIAM: Okay.

00:59:37.844 --> 00:59:40.194
MARISHA: Caduceus, do you need me to buy you anything?

00:59:41.619 --> 00:59:44.474
TALIESIN: Do you got either a-- what do we use,

00:59:44.474 --> 00:59:48.924
300 or 500gp diamonds? Is that our--

00:59:48.924 --> 00:59:51.484
Emergency diamonds are 300 or 500?

00:59:51.484 --> 00:59:54.034
LAURA: 300 for Revivify.

00:59:54.034 --> 00:59:56.444
I think 500 for something else that I can't remember.

00:59:56.444 --> 00:59:59.022
So I have one 300-gold diamond,

00:59:59.022 --> 01:00:03.574
one 500-gold diamond, one 1000-gold diamond.

01:00:03.574 --> 01:00:05.187
TALIESIN: That's an emergency.

01:00:07.494 --> 01:00:09.594
That's for the crazy, crazy restoration

01:00:09.594 --> 01:00:11.964
that's, you know, no time limit.

01:00:11.964 --> 01:00:13.884
LAURA: Right, oh, and I have one more 300, so I have

01:00:13.884 --> 01:00:16.430
two 300-gold diamonds.
TALIESIN: 100 years or something.

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:20.944
TRAVIS: And, remember you got
the 500 gold of residuum for Allura.

01:00:20.944 --> 01:00:24.128
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm actually pretty good.

01:00:24.128 --> 01:00:27.694
I've got enough to-- other than powdered diamond.

01:00:27.694 --> 01:00:31.555
LAURA: I have 400 gold worth of diamond dust.

01:00:31.555 --> 01:00:34.074
TALIESIN: Okay, that'll do. Then I think we're fine.

01:00:34.074 --> 01:00:34.907
MATT: All righty.

01:00:36.374 --> 01:00:39.314
ASHLEY: I would like to buy something.

01:00:39.314 --> 01:00:40.897
MATT: What would you like to buy?

01:00:42.524 --> 01:00:43.591
ASHLEY: I think...

01:00:46.808 --> 01:00:51.808
I'm looking for something that can make you invisible,

01:00:52.544 --> 01:00:54.064
like a potion of invisibility,

01:00:54.064 --> 01:00:56.064
or even a necklace or something.

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:00.848
TALIESIN: Jesus. (mutters)

01:01:01.997 --> 01:01:03.704
ASHLEY: (sighs)
MATT: Go ahead,

01:01:03.704 --> 01:01:07.354
roll either an investigation check or a persuasion check.

01:01:07.354 --> 01:01:08.394
Your choice.

01:01:11.154 --> 01:01:12.404
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:15.417
19?

01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:17.254
MATT: 19.

01:01:17.254 --> 01:01:20.334
It takes you the better part of a day,

01:01:20.334 --> 01:01:22.644
you know, early afternoon or so,

01:01:22.644 --> 01:01:25.144
and eventually after asking some questions,

01:01:25.144 --> 01:01:30.104
you get sent to this small alleyway purveyor

01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:35.104
of odd knickknacks and mashed materials,

01:01:35.574 --> 01:01:40.574
given as various healing pastes and balms.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:42.284
You can see him arranged in the edge

01:01:42.284 --> 01:01:45.234
of this cart that's wedged into the shadows.

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:48.484
The gentleman there has this large red-orange tuft

01:01:48.484 --> 01:01:49.904
of a beard at the end of his chin,

01:01:49.904 --> 01:01:52.504
he's scrawny and leaning forward with long arms

01:01:52.504 --> 01:01:54.674
that rest at the edge of the cart.

01:01:54.674 --> 01:01:56.044
He pulls himself forward out of the shadow

01:01:56.044 --> 01:01:57.514
and looks towards you with this paper hat

01:01:57.514 --> 01:01:59.117
and goes, "Can I help you?

01:01:59.117 --> 01:02:01.384
"Are you looking for something?"

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.964
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:02:02.964 --> 01:02:03.797
Hello.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.988
I'm looking for something, um...

01:02:09.297 --> 01:02:11.349
that could...

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:13.494
(sighs) I don't know if it's maybe a potion

01:02:13.494 --> 01:02:18.494
or maybe a necklace of some sort, but...

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:21.585
where someone couldn't see you.

01:02:21.585 --> 01:02:23.151
Is that a--?

01:02:23.151 --> 01:02:25.785
MATT: "Now, there are many types of not being seen.

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:28.166
"Are you trying to avoid the sight

01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:31.824
"of things from all over or from far away?

01:02:31.824 --> 01:02:33.607
"Immediate or distant?"

01:02:35.864 --> 01:02:36.697
ASHLEY: Well.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.497
Distant?

01:02:41.134 --> 01:02:45.378
MATT: "So avoiding the wandering eyes of divination?"

01:02:46.674 --> 01:02:47.782
ASHLEY: Correct.

01:02:49.654 --> 01:02:51.124
MATT: "Well."

01:02:51.124 --> 01:02:55.494
And he pulls out this small balm vial,

01:02:55.494 --> 01:02:57.474
roughly about the size of a hockey puck or so,

01:02:57.474 --> 01:02:59.374
and opens it up a bit and goes,

01:02:59.374 --> 01:03:02.004
"If this is placed upon your person,

01:03:02.004 --> 01:03:04.904
"smeared into the skin and soaks within,

01:03:04.904 --> 01:03:07.864
"for the next hour, you will be avoiding

01:03:07.864 --> 01:03:11.194
"any sort of prying, magical eyes from a distance,

01:03:11.194 --> 01:03:14.257
"immune to being scryed upon." (laughs)

01:03:15.524 --> 01:03:16.704
ASHLEY: How much is that?

01:03:16.704 --> 01:03:17.537
MATT: "This?

01:03:17.537 --> 01:03:18.934
"Oh, 1500 gold."

01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:20.025
SAM: Oh, jesus.

01:03:21.324 --> 01:03:23.727
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: It seems grossly expensive.

01:03:25.024 --> 01:03:26.891
ASHLEY: That feels grossly expensive.

01:03:26.891 --> 01:03:28.434
(laughter)

01:03:28.434 --> 01:03:31.297
MATT: "Well, it's a particular purpose."

01:03:35.844 --> 01:03:37.464
ASHLEY: Do you have two?

01:03:37.464 --> 01:03:39.414
Is this for one person or is this--

01:03:39.414 --> 01:03:41.644
MATT: "This is for one person."

01:03:41.644 --> 01:03:42.769
TRAVIS: Single use?

01:03:44.134 --> 01:03:45.404
ASHLEY: Hmm?
TRAVIS: Is it single use,

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:49.644
or is it like can-o-disappearing gel.

01:03:50.714 --> 01:03:54.704
MATT: Looking at it, it probably only has a handful of uses

01:03:54.704 --> 01:03:56.054
and only lasts for an hour.

01:03:58.124 --> 01:04:00.494
Even though you aren't the most practiced bargainer,

01:04:00.494 --> 01:04:02.734
even this seems a bit high.

01:04:02.734 --> 01:04:05.524
And, as far as scrying goes, and your experience

01:04:05.524 --> 01:04:07.361
with Jester, it may not be exactly

01:04:07.361 --> 01:04:10.254
what you're looking for, as far as invisibility.

01:04:10.254 --> 01:04:11.814
LIAM: It just says BENGAY on it.

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.033
ASHLEY: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:04:13.033 --> 01:04:15.054
TRAVIS: It's old timer Tiger Balm.

01:04:15.054 --> 01:04:19.150
ASHLEY: I think this is not exactly what I'm looking for.

01:04:19.994 --> 01:04:23.484
It's also a little high in price,

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:25.194
so I think I'm going to--
MATT: "Well,

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:29.501
"prices are relative to who wants it."

01:04:29.501 --> 01:04:30.334
And he goes and tucks it away,

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.884
back underneath the edge of the cart.

01:04:35.554 --> 01:04:36.944
ASHLEY: What about 1000 gold?

01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:38.724
SAM: Ooh, here we go.

01:04:38.724 --> 01:04:39.557
Here we go.

01:04:42.694 --> 01:04:43.674
MATT: "Deal."

01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:44.924
SAM: Oh no.
LAURA: (groaning)

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:46.574
TRAVIS: Or do you want to be invisible?

01:04:49.077 --> 01:04:49.910
SAM: It's done.

01:04:51.745 --> 01:04:53.912
ASHLEY: (sighing)

01:04:57.842 --> 01:05:00.094
I'm trying to think how this could work, actually.

01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:01.321
TRAVIS: You do you, don't let me--

01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:02.224
ASHLEY: No, no, I know.

01:05:02.224 --> 01:05:03.865
I'm just--
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

01:05:03.865 --> 01:05:05.126
TRAVIS: (pigeon cooing)

01:05:05.126 --> 01:05:07.918
SAM: (coos) You're getting ripped off. (coos)

01:05:07.918 --> 01:05:09.773
ASHLEY: I know, I feel like I'm getting--

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:10.722
TRAVIS: Learn from my mistakes!
ASHLEY: This is not exactly what

01:05:10.722 --> 01:05:11.790
I'm looking for anyway.
TRAVIS: (pigeon cooing)

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:13.624
SAM: But, it's okay, it could be cool. (coos)

01:05:13.624 --> 01:05:15.380
TRAVIS: You hear Victor somewhere screaming,

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.390
"Learn from my mistakes!" (laughs)

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:19.014
LIAM: (coos) It's a game. (coos)

01:05:19.014 --> 01:05:20.580
ASHLEY: 1000 gold.
(laughter)

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.204
SAM: (coos) Yeah.
ASHLEY: I'll buy it.

01:05:22.204 --> 01:05:23.574
MATT: Yeah.
MATT: He scoots it forward to you,

01:05:23.574 --> 01:05:28.534
happily grins with a mouth filled with darkened gums.

01:05:28.534 --> 01:05:29.504
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
MATT: And teeth where

01:05:29.504 --> 01:05:30.584
they've receded from a bit,

01:05:30.584 --> 01:05:32.914
so the mouth just seems extra wide.

01:05:32.914 --> 01:05:34.254
LIAM: Scrubbing them too hard.
MATT: His eyes peer

01:05:34.254 --> 01:05:37.057
through from underneath his long paper hat and,

01:05:39.174 --> 01:05:41.287
"Appreciate your patronage."

01:05:42.294 --> 01:05:43.717
Scoops the gold over.

01:05:45.684 --> 01:05:48.704
"Anything else Theodore can do for you?"

01:05:48.704 --> 01:05:52.087
ASHLEY: No, but if this doesn't work,

01:05:54.524 --> 01:05:56.004
I expect to get my money back.

01:05:56.004 --> 01:05:56.844
And, if not--

01:05:56.844 --> 01:05:59.434
MATT: "All sales are final." (simpering laugh)

01:05:59.434 --> 01:06:00.761
ASHLEY: We'll see about that.

01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:02.644
(laughter)

01:06:02.644 --> 01:06:03.477
Goodbye.

01:06:04.578 --> 01:06:06.264
(laughter)

01:06:06.264 --> 01:06:07.595
MATT: "Goodbye!"

01:06:07.595 --> 01:06:08.864
LAURA: Oh no.

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:11.864
MATT: As you walk away, you hear
the sound of a cart shuttering.

01:06:15.474 --> 01:06:16.884
ASHLEY: I hear the sound of a cart shuttering?

01:06:16.884 --> 01:06:19.424
MATT: Meaning, you hear him behind, closing shop.

01:06:19.424 --> 01:06:20.257
TRAVIS: He's getting lost.
MATT: His cart's like...

01:06:20.257 --> 01:06:21.444
(mimicking doors locking)

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.813
ASHLEY: He's like, cool, I'm set for...

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.203
Okay.

01:06:25.203 --> 01:06:26.354
TALIESIN: He's moving.
TRAVIS: 1000 G?

01:06:26.354 --> 01:06:27.872
LIAM: No refunds.

01:06:27.872 --> 01:06:29.865
(mimicking wheels squeaking)
ASHLEY: It's okay.

01:06:29.865 --> 01:06:31.794
SAM: Matt, I would like to buy some things.

01:06:31.794 --> 01:06:32.944
MATT: All right, what would you like?

01:06:32.944 --> 01:06:36.004
SAM: I would like 40 crossbow bolts.

01:06:36.004 --> 01:06:38.924
MATT: That's easy enough to acquire, no major issue there.

01:06:38.924 --> 01:06:40.154
SAM: I would like--

01:06:40.154 --> 01:06:41.536
MATT: Cost on that would be--

01:06:41.536 --> 01:06:44.374
SAM: Oh, sorry. There's cost?

01:06:44.374 --> 01:06:45.284
MATT: Yes, there's...

01:06:47.331 --> 01:06:49.684
LAURA: I have to pay money?

01:06:49.684 --> 01:06:50.704
MARISHA: Give a bolt, take a bolt.

01:06:50.704 --> 01:06:53.204
MATT: I mean, imaginary money. (laughs)

01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:57.214
Acquiring them becomes a hilarious circumstance eventually.

01:06:59.389 --> 01:07:02.354
All right, all right, where's the page?

01:07:02.354 --> 01:07:03.187
There it is.

01:07:07.135 --> 01:07:08.544
(growling)

01:07:08.544 --> 01:07:10.014
I thought it was--
SAM: You could tell me

01:07:10.014 --> 01:07:13.124
literally any amount of money and I would just say, "Fine."

01:07:13.124 --> 01:07:15.384
600 gold pieces.
SAM: You could say 200.

01:07:15.384 --> 01:07:17.469
Fine, done, I don't care. It's all fake money.

01:07:17.469 --> 01:07:18.302
MATT: (laughs)

01:07:18.302 --> 01:07:19.724
TRAVIS: "It's all fake."

01:07:19.724 --> 01:07:23.309
MATT: No, okay, so that would be two gold,

01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:24.419
you're fine.
SAM: Great.

01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:27.124
I would like--

01:07:27.124 --> 01:07:30.074
I'm wearing these little earmuffs

01:07:30.074 --> 01:07:32.794
that have little horns built in onto them.

01:07:32.794 --> 01:07:37.364
I'd like to get, if I can find some sort of shop,

01:07:37.364 --> 01:07:41.277
curio-type shop, a littler pair of horns.

01:07:43.704 --> 01:07:45.904
Antler-y things.
MATT: Okay.

01:07:45.904 --> 01:07:49.624
You do eventually find one of a number of odd haberdasheries

01:07:49.624 --> 01:07:52.184
that are scattered throughout Rexxentrum.

01:07:52.184 --> 01:07:54.744
Going inside, it seems to be more for,

01:07:54.744 --> 01:07:57.544
at least the one that you find for your purposes,

01:07:57.544 --> 01:07:59.314
is a little more meant for silly occasions.

01:07:59.314 --> 01:08:00.894
It's meant for celebrations.

01:08:00.894 --> 01:08:02.294
It's not so much just a classic

01:08:02.294 --> 01:08:04.094
nice-looking hat haberdashery,

01:08:04.094 --> 01:08:08.177
more of a place that presents for events and holidays.

01:08:09.384 --> 01:08:11.304
And, as you inquire within, they do not have

01:08:11.304 --> 01:08:13.554
a hat specifically with antlers on it,

01:08:13.554 --> 01:08:17.394
but they can cobble one together for you,

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.114
ready by the next morning, if you'd like?

01:08:19.114 --> 01:08:20.324
SAM: I'll take it.

01:08:20.324 --> 01:08:21.334
MATT: All right.

01:08:21.334 --> 01:08:23.444
The whole thing together will cost you 20 gold.

01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:24.894
SAM: Amazing.

01:08:24.894 --> 01:08:26.935
Next-- (laughs)

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:31.560
I'd like to buy a lovely flower.

01:08:32.644 --> 01:08:34.724
Like a silver flower.

01:08:34.724 --> 01:08:36.572
MATT: A <i>silver</i> flower?

01:08:36.572 --> 01:08:38.334
SAM: Or white or anything.

01:08:38.334 --> 01:08:39.909
MATT: White's easier.
SAM: Sure.

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:44.364
MATT: (laughs) A silver flower
could be done if it's painted.

01:08:44.364 --> 01:08:47.814
But yeah, white flower, you find for two copper.

01:08:47.814 --> 01:08:49.644
Easy.
SAM: And then lastly,

01:08:49.644 --> 01:08:52.525
the components to make a new Fluffernutter.

01:08:52.525 --> 01:08:54.775
(laughter)

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:58.524
TRAVIS: The real loss. (chuckles)

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:00.334
MATT: Yeah, you can find-- and you would know where to find

01:09:00.334 --> 01:09:03.317
those materials with the right questions being asked.

01:09:04.424 --> 01:09:06.624
Just a singular Fluffernutter?

01:09:06.624 --> 01:09:07.457
SAM: Oh.

01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:08.764
Maybe I should get enough for two,

01:09:08.764 --> 01:09:10.911
in case I fuck one up when I make it.

01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:12.011
LIAM: A double Fluffernutter?
TALIESIN: You fuck one up

01:09:12.011 --> 01:09:12.846
when you make it, you won't be around

01:09:12.846 --> 01:09:15.038
to make a second.
SAM: A double fluffer?

01:09:15.038 --> 01:09:15.871
MATT: All righty.

01:09:15.871 --> 01:09:17.414
We'll say, with the knowledge and experience,

01:09:17.414 --> 01:09:19.373
how powerful do you want this Fluffernutter to be?

01:09:19.373 --> 01:09:20.524
LIAM: (laughs)

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:23.278
SAM: As powerful as the last one, and then some?

01:09:23.278 --> 01:09:24.111
MATT: Okay.

01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:26.317
(laughter)

01:09:26.317 --> 01:09:28.142
SAM: Double the power.

01:09:28.142 --> 01:09:29.473
MATT: Double the nutter, if you will?

01:09:29.473 --> 01:09:31.097
SAM: Yes, double nutter.
MATT: Okay.

01:09:31.097 --> 01:09:32.914
LIAM: Oh.
MATT: (laughs)

01:09:32.914 --> 01:09:34.507
Just asking you, it effects the DC of the check.

01:09:34.507 --> 01:09:36.127
SAM: Sure.
ASHLEY: Double the nutter.

01:09:39.794 --> 01:09:43.634
MATT: We'll say, for the materials to make two fairly

01:09:43.634 --> 01:09:45.782
comparatively powerful Fluffernutters--

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:47.876
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:09:48.834 --> 01:09:50.554
MATT: -- put you back about 120 gold.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:52.204
SAM: Worth it.
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:09:52.204 --> 01:09:53.074
SAM: Boop!

01:09:53.074 --> 01:09:54.487
Thank you, I'm done.
LAURA: That's not bad.

01:09:55.735 --> 01:09:57.131
TRAVIS: Gotta make us some more Fluffernutters.

01:09:57.131 --> 01:09:59.249
MARISHA: (giggles)
TRAVIS: (mimicking explosions)

01:09:59.249 --> 01:10:00.840
MATT: Well, we have to see if he's
successful in making them now.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.546
TRAVIS: Oh, sure.
LAURA: Oh. Uh-oh.

01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:04.834
MATT: Materials can be a waste or worse.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:07.069
TALIESIN: Don't do that in my house, please.

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:08.234
(laughter)

01:10:08.234 --> 01:10:10.643
TALIESIN: I'm restocking on chocolate and cocoa, too.

01:10:10.643 --> 01:10:11.484
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Just, I know it's--

01:10:11.484 --> 01:10:13.824
MATT: As much gold or silver as you'd like to spend on it,

01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:15.698
you can mark it down.
TALIESIN: Stupid amounts.

01:10:15.698 --> 01:10:18.334
MATT: Easy to find in these areas.

01:10:18.334 --> 01:10:23.334
MARISHA: I was wandering the market and sort of bump

01:10:23.424 --> 01:10:28.172
into Veth while looking for flowers as well.

01:10:28.172 --> 01:10:30.100
SAM: Oh, what are you doing here?

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.734
MARISHA: What the fuck are you doing here?

01:10:31.734 --> 01:10:33.075
SAM: Oh, I just bought a flower.

01:10:33.075 --> 01:10:34.519
It's really nice and pretty.

01:10:34.519 --> 01:10:37.204
MARISHA: Very-- that's gorgeous, what kind of flower's that?

01:10:37.204 --> 01:10:39.654
SAM: I didn't ask.

01:10:39.654 --> 01:10:41.164
MARISHA: Huh.

01:10:41.164 --> 01:10:42.934
SAM: I'm not very good with this stuff.

01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:44.504
MARISHA: What do you think of these other flowers?

01:10:44.504 --> 01:10:46.044
SAM: Oh.

01:10:46.044 --> 01:10:47.304
I mean, they're all nice.

01:10:47.304 --> 01:10:48.794
I got this one for you, though.

01:10:48.794 --> 01:10:49.884
MARISHA: Wait, what?

01:10:49.884 --> 01:10:50.814
Why?

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:53.044
SAM: Well, I thought you could give it to Yasha.

01:10:53.044 --> 01:10:53.877
MARISHA: Really?

01:10:53.877 --> 01:10:54.710
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:10:55.864 --> 01:10:58.570
MARISHA: I was here looking for flowers for Yasha.

01:11:01.094 --> 01:11:02.238
SAM: Are you okay?

01:11:02.238 --> 01:11:04.319
MARISHA: I'm okay, I just love you so much!

01:11:04.319 --> 01:11:05.389
I give Veth a hug.
(laughter)

01:11:05.389 --> 01:11:07.102
SAM: Oh, I'm in your belly button now.

01:11:07.102 --> 01:11:08.139
MARISHA: You are.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:09.826
(laughter)

01:11:09.826 --> 01:11:12.944
MARISHA: (sighs) It's a beautiful flower.

01:11:12.944 --> 01:11:14.154
SAM: It's big.

01:11:14.154 --> 01:11:15.204
MARISHA: I know.
SAM: I thought, maybe you could

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.494
talk to Jester and she could make it

01:11:16.494 --> 01:11:20.384
into some sort of corsagey thing, or I don't know.

01:11:20.384 --> 01:11:21.999
I don't know what girls like.

01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:24.924
MARISHA: What do you think of this bow tie

01:11:24.924 --> 01:11:26.917
over here at this other kiosk?

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:28.964
SAM: Bow tie?

01:11:28.964 --> 01:11:31.314
MARISHA: Yeah, this guy over here is-- here, just--

01:11:31.314 --> 01:11:32.691
it's like a houndstooth situ--

01:11:32.691 --> 01:11:34.344
SAM: Oh, I'll take a look.

01:11:34.344 --> 01:11:35.622
MARISHA: What do you think?

01:11:36.604 --> 01:11:38.557
It's blue.

01:11:38.557 --> 01:11:39.862
I ju-- is it--

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:40.704
SAM: For you?

01:11:40.704 --> 01:11:42.773
MARISHA: Houndstooth is a lot, isn't it?

01:11:42.773 --> 01:11:44.304
SAM: For you?

01:11:44.304 --> 01:11:45.761
To dress up?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:46.594
SAM: Oh!

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.444
Oh, I thought like a gift, it's a weird thing

01:11:48.444 --> 01:11:49.754
to <i>give</i> a bow tie.

01:11:49.754 --> 01:11:51.154
MARISHA: No.

01:11:51.154 --> 01:11:52.324
No, it's for me.

01:11:52.324 --> 01:11:54.344
SAM: Oh, then I think it's excellent.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.374
MARISHA: Yeah?
SAM: You can see if they have it

01:11:55.374 --> 01:11:57.154
in turquoise or something.

01:11:57.154 --> 01:11:57.987
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:11:57.987 --> 01:11:59.674
The navy probably clashes a bit.

01:11:59.674 --> 01:12:00.507
SAM: No, I don't know.

01:12:00.507 --> 01:12:02.034
No, I think it looks good.

01:12:02.034 --> 01:12:02.984
Let me see it on.
MARISHA: Do you have it in--

01:12:02.984 --> 01:12:05.035
does he have it in turquoise?

01:12:05.035 --> 01:12:05.868
MATT: Um--

01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:10.264
(laughter)

01:12:10.264 --> 01:12:11.097
LIAM: (coughing)

01:12:11.097 --> 01:12:12.254
MATT: It can be acquired.

01:12:12.254 --> 01:12:13.315
TRAVIS: Let me check.
LIAM: Priceless.

01:12:13.315 --> 01:12:14.826
MARISHA: (sighs) I don't want to wait for a commission.

01:12:14.826 --> 01:12:15.659
SAM: Just do the blue!

01:12:15.659 --> 01:12:16.634
MARISHA: This navy's good.
SAM: Do the blue.

01:12:16.634 --> 01:12:17.866
MATT: "You don't have to wait for a commission."

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:18.945
MARISHA: It's fine.
MATT: "I just have to check

01:12:18.945 --> 01:12:21.231
"down the street, I got friends who have--"

01:12:21.231 --> 01:12:23.104
MARISHA: Oh, you got-- no, no.

01:12:23.104 --> 01:12:24.174
SAM: It's really nice.
MATT: "Never mind.

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:26.432
"Get out of my place then, jeez."

01:12:26.432 --> 01:12:28.224
LAURA: (laughs)

01:12:28.224 --> 01:12:29.501
LIAM: That guy's going to die.

01:12:29.501 --> 01:12:32.514
(laughter)

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.254
MARISHA: Thought the customer was always right,

01:12:34.254 --> 01:12:35.594
but whatever.
SAM: I think it looks

01:12:35.594 --> 01:12:36.844
very distinguished.

01:12:36.844 --> 01:12:37.677
MARISHA: Okay.

01:12:37.677 --> 01:12:39.374
SAM: And smart.

01:12:39.374 --> 01:12:41.054
And not trying too hard.

01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:42.634
It's just like a little.

01:12:42.634 --> 01:12:43.467
MARISHA: Okay.

01:12:45.264 --> 01:12:46.544
I'll take it.

01:12:46.544 --> 01:12:47.737
SAM: I'll pay.

01:12:49.373 --> 01:12:50.644
MARISHA: (childish noise)

01:12:50.644 --> 01:12:51.653
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:12:51.653 --> 01:12:52.626
(laughter)

01:12:52.626 --> 01:12:53.945
Way to come out on top.

01:12:53.945 --> 01:12:55.924
(laughter)

01:12:55.924 --> 01:12:57.761
MATT: "That'll be eight silver."

01:12:57.761 --> 01:12:58.614
SAM: Oh.
(laughter)

01:12:58.614 --> 01:13:01.080
Oh, that's just his speaking voice.

01:13:01.964 --> 01:13:03.204
Sure, here you go.

01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:05.294
10.
MATT: "Thank you."

01:13:05.294 --> 01:13:06.127
SAM: Take 10.

01:13:07.614 --> 01:13:10.134
MARISHA: I sort of asked Yasha out on a date.

01:13:12.664 --> 01:13:13.497
SAM: So did I.

01:13:14.612 --> 01:13:15.524
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:16.974
SAM: I kind of knew.

01:13:16.974 --> 01:13:18.530
I'm sneaky that way.

01:13:19.654 --> 01:13:20.894
And, I'm excited for you!

01:13:20.894 --> 01:13:24.115
Do you think you're going to finally, you know, do it?

01:13:25.524 --> 01:13:27.947
Not <i>it</i>, but go on a date!

01:13:28.874 --> 01:13:30.154
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:13:30.154 --> 01:13:31.044
That's the plan.

01:13:31.044 --> 01:13:32.264
Yeah.

01:13:32.264 --> 01:13:33.764
SAM: Do you think you're going to do it?

01:13:33.764 --> 01:13:35.522
MARISHA: What?
(laughter)

01:13:35.522 --> 01:13:39.664
(laughter)

01:13:41.244 --> 01:13:43.644
MARISHA: I am going into this with no expectations

01:13:43.644 --> 01:13:47.114
and on Yasha's terms and her timeline.

01:13:47.114 --> 01:13:49.864
SAM: I mean, absolutely, it's all about

01:13:49.864 --> 01:13:51.394
what Henry Crabgrass says,

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:52.227
right?
MARISHA: 100%.

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:55.664
Consent.
SAM: Totally, just let her guide.

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:56.784
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Guide you.

01:13:56.784 --> 01:13:58.704
But if you had your druthers?

01:13:58.704 --> 01:13:59.774
MARISHA: I mean.

01:13:59.774 --> 01:14:01.574
SAM: Yeah?
MARISHA: I mean.

01:14:01.574 --> 01:14:03.854
SAM: Yeah?
MARISHA: But we'll see.

01:14:03.854 --> 01:14:04.944
SAM: No expectations.

01:14:04.944 --> 01:14:06.194
MARISHA: I need a shower.

01:14:07.144 --> 01:14:07.994
SAM: Yeah, sure.

01:14:07.994 --> 01:14:10.244
Well, I don't know, maybe not.

01:14:10.244 --> 01:14:12.694
She's, you know...

01:14:12.694 --> 01:14:14.080
Xhorhasian.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:19.014
(laughter)

01:14:19.014 --> 01:14:19.884
I don't know.

01:14:19.884 --> 01:14:21.924
You know, I don't think Xhorhasian ladies

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.742
shave their pits or anything, you know?

01:14:23.742 --> 01:14:27.524
TRAVIS: (tightly) Mm-hm.
(laughter)

01:14:27.524 --> 01:14:28.987
TALIESIN: (muttering) The ladies here.

01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:32.847
MARISHA: Okay.

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:38.288
(laughter)

01:14:38.288 --> 01:14:39.984
SAM: I think you're going to be fine.

01:14:39.984 --> 01:14:41.161
MARISHA: You think so?

01:14:41.161 --> 01:14:42.884
I'm so nervous, dude.
SAM: Yeah!

01:14:42.884 --> 01:14:43.984
You've got a flower.

01:14:43.984 --> 01:14:45.851
You've got a bow tie.
MARISHA: I do.

01:14:47.196 --> 01:14:48.037
Okay.

01:14:48.037 --> 01:14:50.084
SAM: And you've got an open heart.

01:14:50.084 --> 01:14:51.147
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:14:51.147 --> 01:14:52.874
SAM: Whatever happens happens.

01:14:52.874 --> 01:14:55.504
If you just talk, that's a win.

01:14:55.504 --> 01:14:56.664
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:56.664 --> 01:14:58.864
What else-- do I need chocolates or something?

01:14:58.864 --> 01:15:01.234
I got the flower, I got the bow tie, is that...

01:15:02.241 --> 01:15:03.174
That's dumb.
SAM: I mean, I don't think she's

01:15:03.174 --> 01:15:05.964
into chocolates unless they're chocolate-covered

01:15:05.964 --> 01:15:07.848
grasshoppers or something.

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:09.239
But I think,

01:15:10.374 --> 01:15:11.609
maybe just

01:15:14.404 --> 01:15:15.777
plan a moment.

01:15:17.294 --> 01:15:20.784
Just have a moment ready, where you can say something

01:15:20.784 --> 01:15:23.884
or do something that shows how you feel.

01:15:23.884 --> 01:15:25.444
I'm trying to channel Caduceus here,

01:15:25.444 --> 01:15:28.324
but I feel like if you open yourself

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:32.794
and just are honest and open and vulnerable.

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.627
MARISHA: Okay.

01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:36.144
SAM: You could be...

01:15:36.144 --> 01:15:37.631
likable.

01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:41.165
(laughter)

01:15:41.165 --> 01:15:42.755
MARISHA: I could be likable.

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:48.382
Yeah.

01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:50.274
(laughter)

01:15:50.274 --> 01:15:51.107
I could.

01:15:53.614 --> 01:15:56.064
I've planned several moments.

01:15:56.064 --> 01:15:56.904
SAM: You have?

01:15:56.904 --> 01:15:58.724
MARISHA: Uh-huh, I've written them down.

01:15:58.724 --> 01:15:59.687
SAM: No way.

01:16:01.814 --> 01:16:03.344
MARISHA: We'll see, though.

01:16:03.344 --> 01:16:04.634
SAM: Oh, you're not going to tell me any.

01:16:04.634 --> 01:16:07.794
MARISHA: Thank you for your advice, Veth.

01:16:07.794 --> 01:16:09.164
I've got to go find Caleb.

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:12.201
SAM: Okay, bye.
MARISHA: And I just push her aside.

01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:13.034
(laughter)

01:16:13.034 --> 01:16:14.904
LIAM: Caleb is looking for a children's bookstore

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:16.474
at this moment.

01:16:16.474 --> 01:16:18.273
MATT: You know exactly the store to find.

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:20.040
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: It's been there for 60 years

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.284
and still one of the preliminary children

01:16:24.284 --> 01:16:26.674
to young adult bookstores in Rexxentrum.

01:16:26.674 --> 01:16:28.644
LIAM: Excellent, I would like to--

01:16:28.644 --> 01:16:30.384
I am looking for a pair of books

01:16:30.384 --> 01:16:32.257
that I had when I was a child.

01:16:33.524 --> 01:16:36.097
One is a collection of Zemnian fairytales.

01:16:37.264 --> 01:16:41.087
Preferably one that contains a specific one.

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.937
And then also, I'm looking for a--

01:16:44.914 --> 01:16:46.474
I don't even know if it's in print anymore,

01:16:46.474 --> 01:16:50.057
but a primer on transmutation.

01:16:51.444 --> 01:16:52.984
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And magic in general

01:16:52.984 --> 01:16:54.192
for children.

01:16:57.134 --> 01:16:58.664
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:16:58.664 --> 01:16:59.794
That one's a little hard to find.

01:16:59.794 --> 01:17:00.835
LIAM: Yeah.

01:17:05.394 --> 01:17:07.405
22.

01:17:08.734 --> 01:17:10.784
MATT: It's hard to find, but not for you.

01:17:10.784 --> 01:17:13.044
Especially given that you know this so well,

01:17:13.044 --> 01:17:14.494
like the color of the binder,

01:17:15.624 --> 01:17:18.624
the pattern on the spine.

01:17:18.624 --> 01:17:19.844
You know this so well-- (snaps)

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:23.254
that even in a wall of various scattered books, you know

01:17:23.254 --> 01:17:24.512
exactly what to look for. (snaps)

01:17:24.512 --> 01:17:27.654
And the minute you pass by your third

01:17:27.654 --> 01:17:30.137
specific book repository seeking this--

01:17:30.137 --> 01:17:31.078
(snaps)

01:17:31.078 --> 01:17:33.044
you catch it in the lower-right, and there it is.

01:17:33.044 --> 01:17:33.877
One copy.

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:38.994
LIAM: Oh, the illustrations, I remember them very well.

01:17:38.994 --> 01:17:40.914
MATT: "I'm sure you do, you going to buy it?"

01:17:40.914 --> 01:17:43.009
LIAM: Yeah, how much do I owe you for the two?

01:17:43.009 --> 01:17:44.534
MATT: "Let me see that one there.

01:17:46.824 --> 01:17:49.554
"Four silver pieces for the two of them."

01:17:49.554 --> 01:17:51.107
LIAM: Of course.

01:17:51.107 --> 01:17:51.940
I pull that out.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.584
Actually, I just give him a gold.

01:17:53.584 --> 01:17:55.609
MATT: "Wow, oh, wow, wow.

01:17:55.609 --> 01:17:57.209
"Thank you, thank you, um--

01:17:58.714 --> 01:18:01.677
"Well, here, take a copy of our zine."

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:02.855
I don't know.

01:18:02.855 --> 01:18:03.732
(laughter)

01:18:03.732 --> 01:18:08.109
He's just, he's excited. (laughs)

01:18:08.109 --> 01:18:08.942
ASHLEY: Zine?
LIAM: Oh, wow.

01:18:08.942 --> 01:18:12.034
Zemnian punk rock, I am into it.

01:18:12.034 --> 01:18:13.644
Cool, cool, cool.

01:18:13.644 --> 01:18:15.804
Not that long ago, I could not have afforded to do that,

01:18:15.804 --> 01:18:18.494
so enjoy, have a good year.

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:20.014
MATT: "You too."

01:18:20.014 --> 01:18:21.564
LIAM: Okay, and I just stuff it away

01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:22.974
and head out into the street.

01:18:22.974 --> 01:18:23.807
MATT: All right.

01:18:26.054 --> 01:18:27.074
LIAM: I've found everything I need to find.

01:18:27.074 --> 01:18:30.074
MATT: Okay, everybody done their successful shopping?

01:18:30.074 --> 01:18:33.134
MARISHA: I find Caleb coming out of the store!

01:18:33.134 --> 01:18:34.074
LIAM: Oh!

01:18:34.074 --> 01:18:36.024
MARISHA: Hey.

01:18:36.024 --> 01:18:37.599
I wrote down all my ideas.

01:18:39.354 --> 01:18:40.762
LIAM: Oh, yes. Yes?

01:18:40.762 --> 01:18:42.601
MARISHA: Yeah, you wanted me to write them down.

01:18:42.601 --> 01:18:44.190
LIAM: Let me see.
MARISHA: Here.

01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:45.984
I hand him a thing.
I hand him a piece of paper.

01:18:45.984 --> 01:18:48.394
LIAM: All right, I just give it a quick look.

01:18:48.394 --> 01:18:49.511
MARISHA: Mm-hm.
LIAM: Yeah, that's good.

01:18:49.511 --> 01:18:50.669
That's good. Tha--

01:18:53.074 --> 01:18:53.907
MARISHA: What?

01:18:54.924 --> 01:18:56.007
LIAM: Why?

01:18:57.974 --> 01:18:58.982
MARISHA: Because.

01:19:00.534 --> 01:19:02.585
You fucking know why.

01:19:02.585 --> 01:19:07.585
(laughter)
TALIESIN: (coughing)

01:19:08.134 --> 01:19:10.067
LAURA: What? (laughs)

01:19:10.067 --> 01:19:11.142
ASHLEY: Hoh boy.

01:19:13.004 --> 01:19:14.137
MARISHA: They're magic.
LIAM: I will--

01:19:14.137 --> 01:19:16.044
MARISHA: They're not going to last,
it's not going to be forever.

01:19:16.044 --> 01:19:17.855
LIAM: I will-- I will do it.

01:19:18.834 --> 01:19:20.274
MARISHA: Okay.

01:19:20.274 --> 01:19:22.164
LIAM: But that's a lot, Beauregard.

01:19:22.164 --> 01:19:23.324
That's a lot.

01:19:23.324 --> 01:19:26.504
MARISHA: How, out of all the
things on that list, is that a lot?

01:19:26.504 --> 01:19:27.434
LIAM: You wouldn't understand.

01:19:27.434 --> 01:19:28.496
I walk away.

01:19:28.496 --> 01:19:30.180
(laughter)

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.632
TRAVIS: What were y'all even talking about?

01:19:31.632 --> 01:19:35.732
(laughter)

01:19:35.732 --> 01:19:37.140
ASHLEY: (laughing) Oh man.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.377
(laughter)

01:19:39.377 --> 01:19:41.294
I am so nervous.

01:19:41.294 --> 01:19:44.103
(laughter)

01:19:44.103 --> 01:19:45.195
But excited!

01:19:45.195 --> 01:19:47.866
(laughter)

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:50.384
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs)

01:19:51.584 --> 01:19:52.417
LIAM: Oh boy.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:54.747
MATT: All right, unless there's anymore shopping to be done.

01:19:54.747 --> 01:19:57.754
TRAVIS: We could get the ring just appraised if you wanted.

01:19:57.754 --> 01:19:59.854
LAURA: Yes, Fjord, we'll go to get--

01:19:59.854 --> 01:20:01.894
We're going to stop, we're going to get some pastries,

01:20:01.894 --> 01:20:04.744
a lot of extra pastries to go into the haversack

01:20:04.744 --> 01:20:06.724
because it's always good to have pastries.

01:20:06.724 --> 01:20:10.443
And then, yes, Fjord, I will go with you to a jewelry store.

01:20:10.443 --> 01:20:11.786
(giggling)

01:20:11.786 --> 01:20:13.079
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:20:13.079 --> 01:20:14.674
(laughter)

01:20:14.674 --> 01:20:16.264
LAURA: Let's go get this ring appraised.

01:20:16.264 --> 01:20:19.301
TRAVIS: I just want to see if it's kept its value, you know.

01:20:21.101 --> 01:20:22.154
You can hold onto it.

01:20:22.154 --> 01:20:24.007
LAURA: Okay.

01:20:24.007 --> 01:20:26.584
MATT: You gather all the pastries you'd like.

01:20:26.584 --> 01:20:28.574
There are quite a number of locations,

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:30.464
at least in the part of the city
that even you're familiar with,

01:20:30.464 --> 01:20:32.604
which is only a small portion of it,

01:20:32.604 --> 01:20:34.314
where there are a number of bakeries

01:20:34.314 --> 01:20:37.164
and smells and scents that are easy to follow.

01:20:37.164 --> 01:20:40.144
LAURA: We just-- it's like, you know, a bar hop.

01:20:40.144 --> 01:20:41.227
MATT: Right.
LAURA: But,

01:20:42.214 --> 01:20:43.174
a bakery hop.

01:20:43.174 --> 01:20:44.602
MATT: I dig it.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:44.602 --> 01:20:46.814
MATT: God, that'd be delicious. One day again.

01:20:46.814 --> 01:20:48.224
TRAVIS: Right?

01:20:48.224 --> 01:20:49.604
Damn it.

01:20:49.604 --> 01:20:51.374
MATT: And then, yeah, if you would like to,

01:20:51.374 --> 01:20:53.564
you find a prominent jeweler.

01:20:53.564 --> 01:20:57.148
Fancy exterior, a dark blue, painted wood structure

01:20:57.148 --> 01:20:59.031
Fancy exterior, a dark blue, painted wood structure

01:20:59.031 --> 01:21:03.371
with crystal chandeliers that are lit by magical globes

01:21:03.371 --> 01:21:04.874
on the inside of the front way

01:21:04.874 --> 01:21:06.786
and you're like, this would be a decent jeweler.

01:21:06.786 --> 01:21:09.834
TRAVIS: Do you-- I need you-- I need you to do it.

01:21:09.834 --> 01:21:12.484
LAURA: You want me to do it?

01:21:12.484 --> 01:21:14.778
TRAVIS: If it's shit, I'm going to lose my mind.

01:21:14.778 --> 01:21:15.994
(laughter)

01:21:15.994 --> 01:21:18.034
I need you to find out.

01:21:18.034 --> 01:21:20.521
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to put the ring on.

01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:21.354
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:21:23.502 --> 01:21:25.510
LAURA: And I'm going to...

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:28.968
hold myself up as fancily as I can

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:33.079
and I'm going to dramatically walk into the store.

01:21:33.079 --> 01:21:34.629
MATT: (bell ringing)

01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:36.467
LAURA: (loudly) Hello!

01:21:36.467 --> 01:21:38.758
I need a-- I need help!

01:21:39.775 --> 01:21:42.134
MATT: (laughs) The place is fairly empty

01:21:42.134 --> 01:21:44.329
beyond two individuals that work there.

01:21:44.329 --> 01:21:46.564
One, you see a half-elven girl who sits up,

01:21:46.564 --> 01:21:49.339
very short, dark hair,

01:21:49.339 --> 01:21:52.147
a very small pair of spectacles

01:21:52.147 --> 01:21:54.781
that are so small to the point of being ornamental,

01:21:54.781 --> 01:21:56.344
pressed against the cheeks below the eyes.

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:59.814
She looks up at you, this nice button-over blouse.

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:01.444
"Hello, may I help you?"

01:22:01.444 --> 01:22:03.731
LAURA: Yes, I need your help.

01:22:03.731 --> 01:22:04.865
(sighs dramatically)

01:22:07.624 --> 01:22:09.254
It's lovely, isn't it?

01:22:09.254 --> 01:22:10.599
MATT: "Are you betrothed?"

01:22:10.599 --> 01:22:13.124
LAURA: (sighs) I was.

01:22:13.124 --> 01:22:15.377
MATT: "Oh, I am so sorry.

01:22:16.354 --> 01:22:18.914
"I myself was once left at the altar.

01:22:18.914 --> 01:22:20.444
"I understand the heartbreak."

01:22:20.444 --> 01:22:22.074
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

01:22:22.074 --> 01:22:24.450
Anyway, how much could I get for it?

01:22:25.354 --> 01:22:26.204
MATT: "Hmm.

01:22:26.204 --> 01:22:28.244
"Well, if I might?"

01:22:28.244 --> 01:22:29.154
LAURA: Yes.

01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:32.294
MATT: She lays down this soft piece of material.

01:22:32.294 --> 01:22:33.127
Almost like a...

01:22:34.938 --> 01:22:37.767
a velvet or a colorful,

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:41.294
I forget the word I'm looking for.

01:22:41.294 --> 01:22:43.005
But anyway, we'll move on from that,

01:22:43.005 --> 01:22:45.704
as my brain short-circuits.

01:22:45.704 --> 01:22:49.304
Pulls out a jeweler's kit and a long eyepiece.

01:22:49.304 --> 01:22:50.874
LAURA: He was a very wealthy merchant

01:22:50.874 --> 01:22:54.624
and he left me on the high seas.

01:22:54.624 --> 01:22:57.887
I think he might have been taken by pirates.

01:22:58.934 --> 01:23:00.594
MATT: "Hmm.

01:23:00.594 --> 01:23:03.094
"Well, it is a very nice make.

01:23:03.094 --> 01:23:06.277
"The band itself is platinum."

01:23:06.277 --> 01:23:07.477
LAURA: Ooh.
MATT: "And, the ruby,

01:23:07.477 --> 01:23:11.084
"while not magnificent in size, is very well-cut.

01:23:11.084 --> 01:23:14.154
"I'd put this ring-- are you looking to sell it?"

01:23:14.154 --> 01:23:16.119
LAURA: Well, it is enchanted.

01:23:17.644 --> 01:23:18.936
MATT: "Oh.

01:23:21.124 --> 01:23:23.704
"Well, such enchantments, I believe,

01:23:23.704 --> 01:23:25.865
"are a bit beyond our specialty."

01:23:25.865 --> 01:23:26.698
LAURA: Oh.

01:23:28.054 --> 01:23:28.944
Right.

01:23:28.944 --> 01:23:31.834
How much would it be if it wasn't enchanted?

01:23:31.834 --> 01:23:34.004
MATT: "Just standard ring would be,

01:23:34.004 --> 01:23:37.519
"I could take this off your hands
for about 400 gold pieces."

01:23:37.519 --> 01:23:39.394
LAURA: (laughs)

01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:44.014
No, no, no, no, no, that's terrible, here. (mumbles)

01:23:44.014 --> 01:23:46.094
I'll go find an enchanted place.

01:23:46.094 --> 01:23:47.684
Where would that be?

01:23:47.684 --> 01:23:49.904
MATT: "I have a cousin who would be able

01:23:49.904 --> 01:23:51.104
"to take a look at that, if you'd like."

01:23:51.104 --> 01:23:52.824
LAURA: Okay, yeah, sure.

01:23:52.824 --> 01:23:54.891
MATT: "Let me just go ahead and,
if you don't mind waiting here

01:23:54.891 --> 01:23:58.328
"for a bit, he may be on his lunch break soon."

01:23:58.328 --> 01:24:00.054
LAURA: Okay!

01:24:00.054 --> 01:24:01.624
MATT: She darts off and the other person in the back,

01:24:01.624 --> 01:24:03.534
who's deep in a book just looks up,

01:24:03.534 --> 01:24:05.684
you see this older human woman

01:24:05.684 --> 01:24:08.504
with graying hair up in this top bun

01:24:08.504 --> 01:24:11.266
with these frazzled curls coming off of it.

01:24:11.266 --> 01:24:12.299
And she goes,

01:24:12.299 --> 01:24:13.250
"Hey."

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.497
SAM: (laughs)

01:24:14.497 --> 01:24:16.024
MATT: And just goes back to reading.

01:24:16.024 --> 01:24:18.694
You wait there for a good 15, 20 minutes or so

01:24:18.694 --> 01:24:23.094
before the woman comes back with another man,

01:24:23.094 --> 01:24:25.694
looks to be a bit younger than her, also half-elven,

01:24:27.034 --> 01:24:29.637
hair buzzed very close to the head,

01:24:30.554 --> 01:24:32.834
who comes in a bit scattered.

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:33.667
"Oh,

01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:36.156
"I'm still learning.

01:24:36.156 --> 01:24:38.351
"I cannot guarantee that I..."

01:24:39.384 --> 01:24:41.905
She's like, "This is my brother, he'll be able to help you."

01:24:41.905 --> 01:24:43.437
LAURA: I thought it was your cousin.

01:24:47.494 --> 01:24:48.327
MATT: "Brother-cousin."

01:24:48.327 --> 01:24:50.901
LAURA: Oh, I understand.

01:24:50.901 --> 01:24:52.675
(laughter)

01:24:52.675 --> 01:24:54.611
LIAM: The grift is on.
MARISHA: Some Kentucky shit.

01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:56.179
(laughter)

01:24:56.179 --> 01:24:57.179
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:24:58.922 --> 01:25:00.914
MATT: "So if you would have him take a look at this?"

01:25:00.914 --> 01:25:01.747
LAURA: Sure.

01:25:05.044 --> 01:25:06.984
MATT: (as brother-cousin) "Hmm."

01:25:06.984 --> 01:25:10.544
LAURA: It was given to me by my merchant fiancé

01:25:10.544 --> 01:25:13.702
who was stolen by pirates.

01:25:13.702 --> 01:25:14.593
MATT: "Wow."

01:25:14.593 --> 01:25:16.579
LAURA: I know, it was tragic.

01:25:16.579 --> 01:25:18.274
It means a lot to me.

01:25:18.274 --> 01:25:20.844
MATT: (as jeweler) "So, if
you would be so kind as to make sure

01:25:20.844 --> 01:25:25.314
"this deeply pained woman would know

01:25:25.314 --> 01:25:27.234
"the extent of the love that left her."

01:25:27.234 --> 01:25:28.644
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: "Huh?"

01:25:28.644 --> 01:25:31.040
MATT: He goes, "Right, um--

01:25:37.578 --> 01:25:39.204
"(mystical chanting)"

01:25:39.204 --> 01:25:40.786
SAM: Oh boy.

01:25:40.786 --> 01:25:43.019
MATT: "(mystical chanting)

01:25:45.094 --> 01:25:46.614
"Hmm.

01:25:46.614 --> 01:25:47.454
"This ring."

01:25:47.454 --> 01:25:48.984
LAURA: Yes?

01:25:48.984 --> 01:25:52.014
MATT: "This ring does carry some magic to it."

01:25:52.014 --> 01:25:52.847
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:25:54.134 --> 01:25:59.134
MATT: "Namely, is meant for a minor protection."

01:25:59.218 --> 01:26:01.644
LAURA: Oh, a little one?

01:26:01.644 --> 01:26:03.794
MATT: "Yes, I'm afraid that the man who left you

01:26:04.764 --> 01:26:08.994
"was a bit, what's the word that they say?

01:26:08.994 --> 01:26:10.089
"Cheap."

01:26:10.089 --> 01:26:13.694
LAURA: (gasps) No, don't tell me these things!

01:26:13.694 --> 01:26:15.487
My broken heart!

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.064
MATT: "I'm so sorry."

01:26:18.064 --> 01:26:20.534
LAURA: It's not worth anything?

01:26:20.534 --> 01:26:22.794
MATT: "Well, it's worth something, but you know,

01:26:22.794 --> 01:26:24.961
"she would be the person to ask about that."

01:26:24.961 --> 01:26:26.504
LAURA: Oh, I understand.

01:26:26.504 --> 01:26:27.514
MATT: "Mm."

01:26:27.514 --> 01:26:31.938
LAURA: Oh, my poor, cheap, dead fiancé.

01:26:31.938 --> 01:26:34.567
(laughter)

01:26:34.567 --> 01:26:36.354
What will I ever do?

01:26:36.354 --> 01:26:39.394
MATT: (as jeweler) "Well, we
could find it onto the hand

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:42.854
"of somebody who appreciates it, for but a small fee.

01:26:42.854 --> 01:26:45.034
"We'll take it off your hands."
LAURA: (giggling)

01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:47.904
You know what? My heart, it is breaking too much.

01:26:47.904 --> 01:26:51.704
I think I'm just going to take it and wear it forever.

01:26:51.704 --> 01:26:54.147
It will remind me of him.

01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:56.784
(laughter)

01:26:56.784 --> 01:26:58.804
Because you're full of shit.

01:26:58.804 --> 01:27:00.924
This is actually a very expensive ring.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:01.757
Okay?

01:27:02.868 --> 01:27:03.718
MATT: "(scoffing)"

01:27:04.726 --> 01:27:06.374
MARISHA: (gasps)

01:27:06.374 --> 01:27:08.384
MATT: "Well, then good day."

01:27:08.384 --> 01:27:10.154
LAURA: But I really appreciate everything you tried.

01:27:10.154 --> 01:27:12.002
That was a really good performance.

01:27:12.002 --> 01:27:13.984
(laughter)

01:27:13.984 --> 01:27:15.444
MATT: They both look at each other very confused

01:27:15.444 --> 01:27:17.914
and you hear across the room, this: (elderly laughing)

01:27:17.914 --> 01:27:19.371
TRAVIS: (laughs) Good, yeah.

01:27:21.738 --> 01:27:22.571
LAURA: Bye.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.402
MATT: Looks at the other two like, "What'd you expect?"

01:27:24.402 --> 01:27:26.244
LAURA: (giggles)

01:27:26.244 --> 01:27:27.077
MATT: "Good day."

01:27:28.154 --> 01:27:30.693
LAURA: Keep-- keep track of what relative you say.

01:27:30.693 --> 01:27:33.554
It's-- it's import-- okay.

01:27:33.554 --> 01:27:34.674
(laughter)

01:27:34.674 --> 01:27:36.481
MATT: As you're leaving the door, you hear,

01:27:36.481 --> 01:27:37.334
(as brother-cousin) "So are you still paying me?"

01:27:37.334 --> 01:27:38.167
(as jeweler) "No!" (door slamming)

01:27:38.167 --> 01:27:39.785
The door closes.

01:27:39.785 --> 01:27:41.451
LAURA: (gasps) Guess what, Fjord?

01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:42.330
TRAVIS: It's so expensive.

01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:44.944
LAURA: It is so expensive, I got 500 gold for it!

01:27:46.153 --> 01:27:47.603
TRAVIS: What?
LAURA: 500 gold!

01:27:47.603 --> 01:27:49.464
Can you believe it?

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:51.384
TRAVIS: You mean 5,000 gold?

01:27:51.384 --> 01:27:52.674
LAURA: Well, no, 500 gold.

01:27:52.674 --> 01:27:54.304
That's how much you said it was, right?

01:27:54.304 --> 01:27:55.774
TRAVIS: Jester, no!

01:27:55.774 --> 01:27:57.947
No, no, it was 5,000!
LAURA: Oh no!

01:27:57.947 --> 01:27:58.994
What am I going to do?

01:27:58.994 --> 01:28:02.110
My poor, dead pirate fiancé.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.343
(laughter)

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.353
TRAVIS: That was very mean.

01:28:06.353 --> 01:28:08.004
LAURA: I know.

01:28:08.004 --> 01:28:09.364
TRAVIS: You can keep it.

01:28:09.364 --> 01:28:11.064
LAURA: Well, but we should get some money for it, right?

01:28:11.064 --> 01:28:14.164
I'll just wear it until we find somewhere to sell it.

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:16.894
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.
LAURA: It's so sparkly.

01:28:16.894 --> 01:28:18.917
Even if it's not protecting me.

01:28:20.304 --> 01:28:21.736
TRAVIS: You're not going to attune to it?

01:28:21.736 --> 01:28:22.684
You're just wearing it?

01:28:22.684 --> 01:28:24.834
LAURA: Well, Fjord, I can't attune to this

01:28:24.834 --> 01:28:28.037
and also this pink stone that's floating around my head!

01:28:28.037 --> 01:28:29.504
LIAM: (pulsing)
TRAVIS: (sighing)

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.844
When we start to get around the Tomb Takers again,

01:28:31.844 --> 01:28:33.444
one of us should attune to it.

01:28:33.444 --> 01:28:34.644
LAURA: You're right.

01:28:34.644 --> 01:28:36.364
Do you want to put it back on?

01:28:36.364 --> 01:28:37.814
TRAVIS: No, you can keep it for now.

01:28:37.814 --> 01:28:39.324
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:39.324 --> 01:28:42.044
Don't let me get my finger chopped off and lose it.

01:28:42.044 --> 01:28:43.014
TRAVIS: Yeah, that would be bad.

01:28:43.014 --> 01:28:44.139
LAURA: Yeah.

01:28:45.997 --> 01:28:47.444
TRAVIS: All right, we try to find the others.

01:28:47.444 --> 01:28:49.454
(laughter)

01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:51.394
MATT: All right, so that ends your journey

01:28:51.394 --> 01:28:52.227
on that?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:28:52.227 --> 01:28:53.060
MATT: All righty!

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:54.474
LAURA: Success!
MATT: (laughs)

01:28:54.474 --> 01:28:55.757
Well done.
SAM: Worth it.

01:28:57.446 --> 01:28:58.537
TRAVIS: (whispers) Fuck.

01:28:58.537 --> 01:28:59.512
Fuck!

01:28:59.512 --> 01:29:04.024
MATT: As the day slowly clambers on into a dusk shade

01:29:04.024 --> 01:29:06.917
of dark reds, oranges and purples,

01:29:08.444 --> 01:29:11.894
the various magical lanterns of Rexxentrum begin to alight,

01:29:11.894 --> 01:29:15.554
the people begin to shift from their daily chaos

01:29:15.554 --> 01:29:19.728
and hustle and bustle into some elements of...

01:29:19.728 --> 01:29:21.269
celebration,

01:29:21.269 --> 01:29:23.454
some elements of drinking away the pains

01:29:23.454 --> 01:29:26.447
of the day, general rabble-rousing,

01:29:27.674 --> 01:29:31.674
but the life and the energy does shift

01:29:31.674 --> 01:29:34.407
into the night of the capital city.

01:29:35.284 --> 01:29:36.467
What would you like to do?

01:29:38.031 --> 01:29:38.981
SAM: Dance it up.

01:29:38.981 --> 01:29:41.788
LIAM: Yeah, it's just we have a lot to do.

01:29:41.788 --> 01:29:44.138
LAURA: Should we disguise ourselves before we go in?

01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:47.004
LIAM: Yeah, maybe.

01:29:47.004 --> 01:29:48.951
Maybe I stay the way I am

01:29:48.951 --> 01:29:53.051
and you all find a place to sit or dance or...

01:29:53.926 --> 01:29:54.759
LAURA: Okay.

01:29:55.731 --> 01:29:57.496
I can disguise myself.

01:29:57.496 --> 01:29:59.311
TALIESIN: How fancy is everybody looking here?

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:00.847
LIAM: I can do-- oh, no I can't.

01:30:00.847 --> 01:30:03.532
SAM: This is just like a bar, right?

01:30:04.981 --> 01:30:06.921
LIAM: It's more of a beer hall, dance hall.

01:30:06.921 --> 01:30:09.571
So, it's not very fancy, no.

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.731
MATT: It's not like a dive bar by any means,

01:30:11.731 --> 01:30:13.801
but nobody here is coming dressed to the nines.

01:30:13.801 --> 01:30:15.711
It's moderate.

01:30:15.711 --> 01:30:18.354
LIAM: It's like a cultural landmark.

01:30:19.281 --> 01:30:20.921
This is the Empire.

01:30:20.921 --> 01:30:21.754
MATT: Yep.
SAM: Cool.

01:30:22.671 --> 01:30:25.601
TRAVIS: We should be outside as well as inside, yes?

01:30:25.601 --> 01:30:27.151
Who will be outside?

01:30:27.151 --> 01:30:30.896
SAM: I'm no good at seeing things from a distance,

01:30:30.896 --> 01:30:32.271
so maybe I could be close up

01:30:32.271 --> 01:30:35.021
and either invisible or disguised.

01:30:35.021 --> 01:30:35.854
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:30:35.854 --> 01:30:37.934
TRAVIS: I will stay outside the door.

01:30:38.771 --> 01:30:39.981
Are there a ton of...

01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:44.791
Yes, I will look like someone

01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:46.441
who has taken their drink outside

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:50.661
and is just posted up, back against the establishment,

01:30:50.661 --> 01:30:52.551
perhaps too far into my cups.

01:30:52.551 --> 01:30:54.471
MATT: Got it, so you're posted out front

01:30:54.471 --> 01:30:58.237
playing the part of an early evening drunkard.

01:30:58.237 --> 01:31:02.231
TRAVIS: (drunk mumbling)

01:31:02.231 --> 01:31:03.561
MATT: Fair enough. Who else?

01:31:03.561 --> 01:31:07.821
TALIESIN: I'm going to go red-headed, bearded human male.

01:31:07.821 --> 01:31:12.271
Build my atypical-- my Ford Prefect.

01:31:12.271 --> 01:31:13.571
MATT: Okay.

01:31:13.571 --> 01:31:14.851
TALIESIN: And dressed all right,

01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:16.031
I'm going to sit in the corner of the bar

01:31:16.031 --> 01:31:17.981
trying to get the full lay of the place

01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:22.962
and just nurse some fruit juice.

01:31:22.962 --> 01:31:23.862
LAURA: (giggles)

01:31:23.862 --> 01:31:24.695
MATT: Fair enough.

01:31:24.695 --> 01:31:26.901
LIAM: Okay, so you're red-headed and inside?

01:31:26.901 --> 01:31:27.951
You're inside the place?

01:31:27.951 --> 01:31:29.621
TALIESIN: I'm inside the place.
LIAM: With red hair.

01:31:29.621 --> 01:31:30.651
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:31.871
LAURA: I'll be inside as well.

01:31:31.871 --> 01:31:34.611
TRAVIS: Outside, human looking, a little busted up.

01:31:34.611 --> 01:31:35.444
LIAM: Okay.

01:31:35.444 --> 01:31:36.864
TRAVIS: But not near the front door,

01:31:36.864 --> 01:31:38.801
probably 50, 60 feet away from the door.

01:31:38.801 --> 01:31:40.041
MATT: Okay, you've got it.

01:31:40.041 --> 01:31:42.061
LAURA: I'll be inside as well.

01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:44.727
A human woman,

01:31:46.053 --> 01:31:49.511
long black hair, tight fitting dress.

01:31:49.511 --> 01:31:52.036
long black hair, tight fitting dress.

01:31:53.951 --> 01:31:55.991
Bombshell hanging out at the dance floor,

01:31:55.991 --> 01:31:59.151
waiting for some young stud to sweep me on my feet.

01:31:59.151 --> 01:32:00.414
MATT: Okay, you've got it.

01:32:02.766 --> 01:32:06.836
ASHLEY: I'll post up in a corner in a booth,

01:32:06.836 --> 01:32:09.181
real quiet, just making sure--

01:32:09.181 --> 01:32:10.638
TALIESIN: All the different vantage points.
ASHLEY: Nothing behind me.

01:32:10.638 --> 01:32:12.015
SAM: You can't disguise yourself, can you?

01:32:12.015 --> 01:32:15.278
MARISHA: Uh uh. Trying to figure out what's best for me.

01:32:15.278 --> 01:32:17.324
SAM: I can make you invisible for an hour.

01:32:19.591 --> 01:32:21.461
MARISHA: Whatever you feeling.

01:32:21.461 --> 01:32:23.061
Are you also going to be invisible?

01:32:25.881 --> 01:32:28.591
SAM: I could be, yeah. We could be the invisible ones.

01:32:28.591 --> 01:32:31.914
I think I can do that if I do it at a higher level?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.261
Yeah, I can do that.

01:32:34.261 --> 01:32:36.031
I can make us both invisible.

01:32:36.031 --> 01:32:39.535
MARISHA: Okay, I'll be with Nott. We're invisible.

01:32:39.535 --> 01:32:42.081
TALIESIN: I have an image of you just
hanging from the chandelier doing this.

01:32:42.081 --> 01:32:42.914
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:32:44.221 --> 01:32:45.241
Full "Minority Report".

01:32:45.241 --> 01:32:46.711
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Yep.

01:32:46.711 --> 01:32:48.981
All right, so, you both vanish.

01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:53.301
LIAM: I wanted to ask, you have my old medallion yeah?

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:54.548
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: May I borrow it?

01:32:54.548 --> 01:32:56.471
LAURA: Of course, of course.
LIAM: Just for this.

01:32:56.471 --> 01:32:57.304
Okay.

01:32:57.304 --> 01:32:59.488
LAURA: I mean, (mid-atlantic accent) of course, of course.

01:32:59.488 --> 01:33:01.641
(laughter)

01:33:01.641 --> 01:33:03.545
Whatever you need, stud.

01:33:03.545 --> 01:33:05.312
SAM: You're going to get hit on so much tonight.

01:33:05.312 --> 01:33:06.911
(laughter)

01:33:06.911 --> 01:33:09.431
LIAM: That's a lot of confusing. Okay.

01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:12.161
I will go sit at a table

01:33:12.161 --> 01:33:13.891
on the edge of the dance floor and wait.

01:33:13.891 --> 01:33:15.821
MATT: Right, the usual table?

01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:17.316
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

01:33:20.184 --> 01:33:21.964
10, 15 minutes or so go by,

01:33:23.041 --> 01:33:25.009
keeping an eye on the crowd in here.

01:33:25.009 --> 01:33:28.431
The odd hustle and bustle, the mixture of languages,

01:33:28.431 --> 01:33:30.591
laughter, the occasional argument.

01:33:30.591 --> 01:33:32.591
Mostly the energy here is fairly jovial.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:34.961
Drinks and food being brought about.

01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:38.381
It is as pleasant as you recall.

01:33:38.381 --> 01:33:39.671
And one of the more pleasant locations

01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:41.231
you've been to in Rexxentrum.

01:33:42.571 --> 01:33:44.221
LIAM: Before you dig in deeper,

01:33:44.221 --> 01:33:46.541
one last thing I wanted to do before this moment,

01:33:46.541 --> 01:33:48.771
I would have run off to the loo

01:33:48.771 --> 01:33:50.821
to cast Fortune's Favor on myself.

01:33:50.821 --> 01:33:51.810
SAM: To rub one out.

01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:53.471
(laughter)
LIAM: To rub one out.

01:33:53.471 --> 01:33:54.891
SAM: You got to prep before the date.

01:33:54.891 --> 01:33:58.226
LIAM: You can cast Fortune's Favor anywhere on your person.

01:33:59.907 --> 01:34:02.907
(laughter)

01:34:03.891 --> 01:34:05.451
SAM: You don't want to go in loaded.

01:34:05.451 --> 01:34:06.284
TRAVIS: Heroism.

01:34:07.731 --> 01:34:08.720
LIAM: Geometric shapes.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.701
(laughter)

01:34:11.701 --> 01:34:13.257
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Matt's red.

01:34:13.257 --> 01:34:15.300
(laughter)

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.514
MATT: I just envision just holding
the little black pearl and going--

01:34:20.837 --> 01:34:25.837
(laughter)

01:34:27.351 --> 01:34:29.431
LIAM: Not the black one. I need
that one to go to Rumblecusp.

01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:30.511
One of ones I bought today.

01:34:30.511 --> 01:34:33.881
Anyway, back to the table, back to your excellent narration.

01:34:33.881 --> 01:34:37.644
MATT: As you return from your favoring fortune,

01:34:39.141 --> 01:34:40.884
you've been hit on numerous times,

01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:44.761
usually by-- let's say one of them

01:34:44.761 --> 01:34:47.128
was just a very shy gentleman who was like,

01:34:47.128 --> 01:34:49.268
"Would you care for a dance, maybe?"

01:34:50.271 --> 01:34:51.322
LAURA: Sure.

01:34:51.322 --> 01:34:53.621
(laughter)

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:55.287
MATT: He didn't know what to do.
He's like, (nervous stammering)

01:34:55.287 --> 01:34:57.731
and you just scared him off briefly.

01:34:57.731 --> 01:34:59.541
Another one's a total douche bro

01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:02.221
who just came up to you, sleeves rolled up,

01:35:02.221 --> 01:35:03.561
hair wet back

01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:05.669
and he's got his big, heavy tankard in his hand

01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:09.481
and he's just like, "Would you like to dance, eh?"

01:35:09.481 --> 01:35:10.738
LAURA: Fuck off, kid.

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:14.754
(laughter)

01:35:14.754 --> 01:35:15.587
MARISHA: Yep.

01:35:15.587 --> 01:35:18.082
(laughter)

01:35:18.082 --> 01:35:19.886
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:35:19.886 --> 01:35:23.441
MATT: In the midst of the sound and chuckles

01:35:23.441 --> 01:35:26.324
and shouts and music and drums,

01:35:27.251 --> 01:35:29.351
everything gets a bit quiet.

01:35:29.351 --> 01:35:34.041
Caleb is glancing across the chamber into the entry way.

01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:35.391
You see stepping in

01:35:36.561 --> 01:35:41.561
a female figure, wearing a casual, dark gray,

01:35:42.581 --> 01:35:45.781
looks like a short robe

01:35:45.781 --> 01:35:48.301
with a mantle over top and a hood.

01:35:48.301 --> 01:35:50.061
She pulls it back just a little bit

01:35:50.061 --> 01:35:51.561
and glances about.

01:35:51.561 --> 01:35:56.561
You can see the familiar lightish hair past the eyes

01:35:57.731 --> 01:35:58.854
as they meet yours.

01:36:01.341 --> 01:36:03.824
And she beelines across the chamber.

01:36:04.901 --> 01:36:06.301
TRAVIS: Did I see her come in?

01:36:06.301 --> 01:36:08.421
MATT: You did.
TRAVIS: Was she alone?

01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:09.921
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:36:13.321 --> 01:36:14.941
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16.

01:36:14.941 --> 01:36:16.311
TRAVIS; And rooftops on the street.

01:36:16.311 --> 01:36:18.801
MATT: Yeah. Glancing about, she appears to be alone.

01:36:18.801 --> 01:36:22.621
SAM: After she comes in, I'm going to start wandering around

01:36:22.621 --> 01:36:25.521
without bumping into anybody if I can,

01:36:25.521 --> 01:36:27.921
using my Blindsense

01:36:27.921 --> 01:36:30.901
to see if I can see any other invisible people around.

01:36:30.901 --> 01:36:32.361
MATT: Interesting, make an acrobatics check.

01:36:32.361 --> 01:36:33.194
SAM: Okay.

01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:38.309
Wow, that landed on top of another die.

01:36:38.309 --> 01:36:39.284
MATT: I saw that.

01:36:40.121 --> 01:36:40.954
SAM: Should I take it?

01:36:40.954 --> 01:36:41.787
MATT: Yeah!

01:36:41.787 --> 01:36:44.964
SAM: It's 19 plus 10, 29.

01:36:44.964 --> 01:36:46.181
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:36:46.181 --> 01:36:47.691
MATT: You're not just dodging through the crowd,

01:36:47.691 --> 01:36:49.701
you are pirouette-ing and leaping

01:36:49.701 --> 01:36:52.481
and corkscrewing and yeah, it is--

01:36:52.481 --> 01:36:53.631
TRAVIS: Catherine Zeta-Jones.

01:36:54.465 --> 01:36:56.391
MATT: (laughs)

01:36:56.391 --> 01:36:57.811
If anyone could see you, it would look like

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.661
the coolest display of Capoeira.

01:36:59.661 --> 01:37:02.921
You're just leaping and spinning through the crowd

01:37:02.921 --> 01:37:05.581
and between people, but keeping it to the beat of the music.

01:37:05.581 --> 01:37:07.381
It's awesome, but nobody can see it.

01:37:08.224 --> 01:37:09.341
LIAM: Otis ain't shit.

01:37:10.481 --> 01:37:14.401
MATT: You do not sense anyone mysteriously invisible

01:37:14.401 --> 01:37:17.494
in the chamber around you, aside from Beauregard.

01:37:17.494 --> 01:37:19.161
SAM: Oh, there you are.

01:37:20.261 --> 01:37:23.439
MARISHA: Are there exposed beams in this place?

01:37:23.439 --> 01:37:24.741
MATT: On this? Yes, there are.

01:37:24.741 --> 01:37:26.721
It is a higher ceiling here on the base floor.

01:37:26.721 --> 01:37:28.031
MARISHA: I'm going to do some dope monk shit

01:37:28.031 --> 01:37:29.351
and I'm going to get up in the beams,

01:37:29.351 --> 01:37:30.904
so I can patrol from the top.

01:37:31.921 --> 01:37:33.871
MATT: Make an acrobatics check, super easy.

01:37:34.991 --> 01:37:36.261
MARISHA: It'll be hilarious if I fail.

01:37:36.261 --> 01:37:38.031
MATT: That's why I had her roll, just in case.

01:37:38.031 --> 01:37:41.881
MARISHA: It's fine, 23.

01:37:41.881 --> 01:37:44.851
MATT: Easily done. There are easy footholds

01:37:44.851 --> 01:37:46.231
on the various planks in the wall

01:37:46.231 --> 01:37:48.271
and you just (effortless grunting)

01:37:48.271 --> 01:37:49.751
and you're up there with nary a sound.

01:37:49.751 --> 01:37:53.031
Any sort of slight impact or noise

01:37:53.031 --> 01:37:55.084
is drowned out by the surrounding din.

01:37:56.281 --> 01:37:57.181
No worries.

01:37:57.181 --> 01:37:58.851
MARISHA: I'm just going to patrol from above.

01:37:58.851 --> 01:37:59.684
MATT: You've got it.

01:38:01.611 --> 01:38:03.661
You watch as she comes and joins across

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:07.101
your sitting arrangement.

01:38:07.101 --> 01:38:09.971
Pulls the hood back over her shoulders.

01:38:09.971 --> 01:38:11.771
Smiles a bit before leaning forward.

01:38:14.091 --> 01:38:15.701
(as Astrid) "It is good to see you, Bren."

01:38:16.611 --> 01:38:18.411
LIAM: It's good to see you. Have a seat.

01:38:23.501 --> 01:38:27.944
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice.

01:38:30.231 --> 01:38:33.564
I don't know, I'm very nervous here.

01:38:34.501 --> 01:38:38.174
More than I have been on our past meetings.

01:38:42.921 --> 01:38:45.011
I've sort of been trying to rehearse all day

01:38:45.011 --> 01:38:46.864
what I would talk to you about here.

01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:50.627
And none of it seems...

01:38:54.010 --> 01:38:55.151
appropriate.

01:38:58.901 --> 01:39:02.831
Things okay here after our dinner?

01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:07.821
MATT: She glances about the room.

01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:18.165
"They've been interesting.

01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:31.858
"You and your friends traveled to Eiselcross

01:39:31.858 --> 01:39:34.758
"You and your friends traveled to Eiselcross

01:39:35.611 --> 01:39:37.619
"at the behest of Vess DeRogna?"

01:39:41.551 --> 01:39:44.484
LIAM: We did. Come on, let's dance.

01:39:46.511 --> 01:39:48.331
And I take her by the hand and lead her

01:39:48.331 --> 01:39:50.121
onto the middle of the floor.

01:39:50.121 --> 01:39:51.704
MATT: She goes along willing.

01:39:53.151 --> 01:39:55.011
And as you both begin to dance

01:39:55.011 --> 01:39:58.931
and the tune here is a little more of a rhythmic sway.

01:39:58.931 --> 01:40:03.151
So, it's easy enough to engage, but interesting,

01:40:03.151 --> 01:40:08.151
it's been a while since you've been in a position

01:40:08.541 --> 01:40:12.241
to try and lead, but your partner is also

01:40:12.241 --> 01:40:13.971
often switching and taking the lead.

01:40:13.971 --> 01:40:18.411
There's almost a duel within the duet of a dance

01:40:18.411 --> 01:40:20.551
as she comes by and brushes past your ear

01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:23.341
and whispers, keeping it covert

01:40:23.341 --> 01:40:24.991
while looking over your shoulder.

01:40:27.041 --> 01:40:28.977
"Ludinus has been keeping an eye.

01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:34.491
"Never one to trust Vess.

01:40:36.011 --> 01:40:40.653
"So he requested you be tracked

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.010
"by Volstrucker.

01:40:46.961 --> 01:40:48.369
"So we followed you."

01:40:50.353 --> 01:40:51.453
LIAM: How far did you get?

01:40:52.691 --> 01:40:54.661
MATT: "Well, quite a bit until you

01:40:54.661 --> 01:40:57.801
"came to a base of a mountain range and turned into birds.

01:40:57.801 --> 01:41:00.624
"It's hard for us to follow those who polymorph,

01:41:02.831 --> 01:41:06.664
"but you need to be careful.

01:41:09.491 --> 01:41:14.241
"Ludinus is very well aware of what has become of Vess.

01:41:15.757 --> 01:41:17.240
"He knows of your proximity.

01:41:20.751 --> 01:41:21.674
"Just be careful."

01:41:23.221 --> 01:41:26.954
LIAM: What does Ludinus know of her condition?

01:41:28.042 --> 01:41:29.831
MATT: "I do not know.

01:41:29.831 --> 01:41:33.786
"I just know that no one has heard from her

01:41:33.786 --> 01:41:35.652
"in the Assembly for weeks.

01:41:37.145 --> 01:41:38.945
"And you were the last to leave with her."

01:41:47.241 --> 01:41:49.266
LIAM: I struggle with...

01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:58.223
trust and I want very much to trust you.

01:42:03.631 --> 01:42:06.414
I think we both know that's not entirely possible.

01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:10.031
MATT: "Not if we're both to stay alive."

01:42:14.031 --> 01:42:16.201
LIAM: What I wanted for the Empire as a child is different

01:42:16.201 --> 01:42:18.101
than what I want for the Empire today.

01:42:21.071 --> 01:42:22.691
And I would hazard a guess

01:42:22.691 --> 01:42:24.331
that what you and I want for the Empire

01:42:24.331 --> 01:42:29.331
is similar in some ways, but different than many others.

01:42:33.441 --> 01:42:35.114
I turn around and scan the room.

01:42:36.541 --> 01:42:37.374
MATT: For?

01:42:38.688 --> 01:42:39.771
LIAM: Where everyone is.

01:42:40.711 --> 01:42:42.741
MATT: You can make out everybody except for--

01:42:42.741 --> 01:42:44.484
I'll let you make a perception check.

01:42:48.921 --> 01:42:50.571
LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18.

01:42:50.571 --> 01:42:52.171
You see Yasha in the corner.

01:42:52.171 --> 01:42:54.801
You see dancing not far from you,

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:58.331
Jester in her illusory form.

01:42:58.331 --> 01:43:00.321
You see Caduceus having a seat

01:43:00.321 --> 01:43:02.651
and sipping from a drink

01:43:02.651 --> 01:43:05.031
and that's all you can see within the chamber.

01:43:05.031 --> 01:43:06.951
But all eyes are in your direction

01:43:06.951 --> 01:43:08.651
and they're keeping a close watch.

01:43:14.201 --> 01:43:17.393
LIAM: I care very much for the friendship that we once had,

01:43:19.521 --> 01:43:21.271
but I don't trust you entirely,

01:43:21.271 --> 01:43:22.964
and I'm sure you do not trust me.

01:43:24.621 --> 01:43:29.064
And yet I have come here today to ask you a favor.

01:43:33.211 --> 01:43:37.291
A few weeks ago, the number one thing on my mind

01:43:37.291 --> 01:43:40.919
was trying to sort out the pieces after that peace treaty

01:43:40.919 --> 01:43:45.286
and how to improve things here at home

01:43:46.961 --> 01:43:49.152
and all that is gone.

01:43:50.871 --> 01:43:52.846
My friends and I,

01:43:55.445 --> 01:43:57.886
we are getting wrapped up in something.

01:43:59.551 --> 01:44:04.551
A danger, a very real danger

01:44:05.538 --> 01:44:10.294
that includes the survival of the Empire,

01:44:12.381 --> 01:44:17.366
the Kryn, all of us.

01:44:22.081 --> 01:44:26.716
There is something terrible coming out of the north.

01:44:28.901 --> 01:44:31.434
Something that has no preference for nation.

01:44:34.851 --> 01:44:38.392
And this is going to be so hard to swallow and overlook,

01:44:38.392 --> 01:44:42.061
And this is going to be so hard to swallow and overlook,

01:44:42.061 --> 01:44:44.941
but I need your help.

01:44:44.941 --> 01:44:48.251
We are in a race with a ticking clock

01:44:48.251 --> 01:44:51.950
to stop a very real threat from being unleashed.

01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:55.091
to stop a very real threat from being unleashed.

01:44:58.061 --> 01:44:58.894
And we're being tracked,

01:44:58.894 --> 01:45:02.101
in fact, I may be watched at this very moment,

01:45:02.101 --> 01:45:04.434
which means you may be.

01:45:05.971 --> 01:45:07.521
Do you still wear one of these?

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:11.361
MATT: Her eyes still pass by yours

01:45:11.361 --> 01:45:13.908
and she grabs your hand and begins leading you

01:45:13.908 --> 01:45:17.321
and the dynamic of the dance has shifted.

01:45:17.321 --> 01:45:20.381
And as she brings your hand up across the shoulder.

01:45:20.381 --> 01:45:22.151
You see it brush past a cord on her neck

01:45:22.151 --> 01:45:26.171
where a similar medallion briefly drifts out

01:45:26.171 --> 01:45:28.564
before it slides back beneath the shawl.

01:45:29.811 --> 01:45:32.781
She spins you around and pulls you in

01:45:32.781 --> 01:45:35.854
and switching into Zemnian, she says,

01:45:39.101 --> 01:45:41.231
(American accent) "These are odd times indeed.

01:45:43.831 --> 01:45:46.492
"But this confusion is advantageous."

01:45:50.981 --> 01:45:53.684
LIAM: (American accent) If there
is any love left between us,

01:45:57.641 --> 01:45:59.832
I need more of these.

01:46:03.294 --> 01:46:06.441
And I just lay my head against her head

01:46:06.441 --> 01:46:08.066
and dance for a moment.

01:46:10.951 --> 01:46:15.951
Not forever, not for anything against the Empire or you.

01:46:20.081 --> 01:46:24.724
My differences with you, we'll save them for a later day.

01:46:29.121 --> 01:46:31.171
But I need enough of these for my friends

01:46:33.641 --> 01:46:35.024
for a few weeks maybe,

01:46:36.721 --> 01:46:38.864
so that we can go unnoticed.

01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:45.798
And I promise you,

01:46:49.006 --> 01:46:51.731
as the boy that I once was

01:46:54.234 --> 01:46:56.351
and the love that the three of us shared.

01:46:58.821 --> 01:47:02.646
I mean no harm against the Empire, or you, now.

01:47:02.646 --> 01:47:05.221
I mean no harm against the Empire, or you, now.

01:47:06.719 --> 01:47:08.069
And I will bring them back.

01:47:12.381 --> 01:47:14.087
I'm begging, Astrid.

01:47:16.331 --> 01:47:17.998
MATT: As you leaned into her,

01:47:21.281 --> 01:47:22.251
there's a brief moment where

01:47:22.251 --> 01:47:23.361
even though you're still dancing,

01:47:23.361 --> 01:47:25.241
her body seizes briefly.

01:47:25.241 --> 01:47:27.841
That limber sway

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:31.201
to the beat clams up ever so slightly

01:47:32.155 --> 01:47:35.811
and you feel her hand touch your back and shoulder

01:47:36.697 --> 01:47:39.681
and she falls back into lockstep with you

01:47:39.681 --> 01:47:41.786
and listens. There's that pause

01:47:47.181 --> 01:47:48.691
and she just leans into your ear.

01:47:48.691 --> 01:47:50.141
You're just cheek to cheek,

01:47:50.141 --> 01:47:51.691
not even looking at each other.

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:56.126
(American accent) "I'll see what I can do.

01:47:59.971 --> 01:48:01.521
"Just know there are eyes on you,

01:48:07.351 --> 01:48:12.351
"which means either we're walking into their trap,

01:48:15.731 --> 01:48:17.481
"or you beat them at their own game."

01:48:21.141 --> 01:48:22.551
LIAM: As she says those things

01:48:23.948 --> 01:48:25.021
and we're dancing around the room,

01:48:25.021 --> 01:48:27.701
I spot Jester on watch,

01:48:32.321 --> 01:48:37.114
tracking her insane dance moves until we spin away.

01:48:41.811 --> 01:48:43.161
And then I pull back a bit.

01:48:44.421 --> 01:48:46.456
MATT: As you pull back, she pulls back a bit, too,

01:48:46.456 --> 01:48:51.456
and you can see her right herself and smile,

01:48:51.641 --> 01:48:53.131
putting on that formal mask,

01:48:53.131 --> 01:48:55.634
that veneer that you've seen before.

01:48:57.141 --> 01:48:59.121
It drops again briefly, she looks at you once more

01:48:59.121 --> 01:49:03.252
in Zemnian and says, "They know you're here.

01:49:09.481 --> 01:49:10.781
"It could be an opportunity,

01:49:14.501 --> 01:49:15.644
"if you strike first.

01:49:20.321 --> 01:49:22.599
(German accent) "Well, it was good to see you.

01:49:23.701 --> 01:49:25.671
"Enjoy the rest of your evening

01:49:25.671 --> 01:49:30.671
"and, well, maybe we'll catch up some other time."

01:49:31.006 --> 01:49:32.850
LIAM: <i>Fraulein</i>.

01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:34.251
MATT: "<i>Tschüss</i>, Bren."

01:49:34.251 --> 01:49:39.014
She puts her hood up and goes to exit the location.

01:49:41.411 --> 01:49:43.681
You watch your exit and head out.

01:49:43.681 --> 01:49:45.064
MARISHA: I follow.

01:49:46.621 --> 01:49:50.351
I (footsteps) across the beams,

01:49:50.351 --> 01:49:53.024
slink down one of the walls,

01:49:54.101 --> 01:49:56.501
trail her out the front entrance a little bit.

01:49:56.501 --> 01:49:57.334
MATT: Okay.

01:49:57.334 --> 01:49:59.531
TRAVIS: As I see Beau leave, I'm like (coughs).

01:49:59.531 --> 01:50:00.421
LAURA: No, she's invisible.

01:50:00.421 --> 01:50:01.281
TRAVIS: Oh. No, didn't see.

01:50:01.281 --> 01:50:03.017
MARISHA: I will--

01:50:03.017 --> 01:50:05.375
(laughter)

01:50:06.311 --> 01:50:07.401
MATT: You accidentally inhale some of that spit.

01:50:07.401 --> 01:50:09.484
You're like (coughs).

01:50:09.484 --> 01:50:14.352
MARISHA: I'll give Fjord a little
pop pop on the shoulder, though.

01:50:14.352 --> 01:50:16.021
TRAVIS: (scared stammering)

01:50:16.021 --> 01:50:18.121
MARISHA: Be cool, be fucking--

01:50:18.121 --> 01:50:18.954
Jeez.

01:50:19.901 --> 01:50:21.572
SAM: Ghosts!

01:50:21.572 --> 01:50:23.080
Like sneaking up on a cat. (yowls)

01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:25.001
Right in the tit.

01:50:28.551 --> 01:50:29.711
MARISHA: I track just for a little bit.

01:50:29.711 --> 01:50:31.911
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check with advantage.

01:50:34.001 --> 01:50:35.568
TRAVIS: Putting a cucumber behind me.

01:50:36.831 --> 01:50:38.501
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

01:50:38.501 --> 01:50:42.478
Natural 20, Gil! ♪ It's been a while! ♪

01:50:42.478 --> 01:50:43.894
And 30 total.

01:50:45.221 --> 01:50:46.054
MATT: All righty.

01:50:47.761 --> 01:50:51.821
You follow her for about seven or eight minutes

01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:55.391
before you see her veer off the road a bit

01:50:55.391 --> 01:51:00.071
and head into just a small, not even an alley,

01:51:00.071 --> 01:51:02.421
but a little pocket between two buildings

01:51:02.421 --> 01:51:05.501
MARISHA: Alley, pocket, okay, got it.
SAM: You're writing down "alley"?

01:51:05.501 --> 01:51:08.432
MARISHA: Dude, I might need to find this again.

01:51:09.881 --> 01:51:10.961
Go, go, go
MATT: Okay.

01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:13.981
As you catch around the side

01:51:13.981 --> 01:51:15.634
about three, four feet.

01:51:16.711 --> 01:51:17.678
MARISHA: Three, four feet.

01:51:17.678 --> 01:51:20.501
(laughter)

01:51:20.501 --> 01:51:24.279
MATT: Within this side pocket you see her now

01:51:24.279 --> 01:51:25.301
back against the wall,

01:51:25.301 --> 01:51:28.631
sitting on the ground, knees close to the chest

01:51:28.631 --> 01:51:31.181
and she's just curled up in a ball.

01:51:38.824 --> 01:51:42.161
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:51:42.161 --> 01:51:44.003
How long does she sit there?

01:51:45.991 --> 01:51:47.691
MATT: About five or six minutes or so.

01:51:47.691 --> 01:51:50.851
MARISHA: Does she seem deeply conflicted, clearly?

01:51:50.851 --> 01:51:52.351
Or what was her--

01:51:52.351 --> 01:51:53.204
TRAVIS: Good.

01:51:53.204 --> 01:51:54.579
(laughter)

01:51:54.579 --> 01:51:56.337
MATT: "Deeply conflicted"?

01:51:56.337 --> 01:51:57.561
I don't know!

01:51:57.561 --> 01:52:00.011
MARISHA: Not to be projecting on her or anything.
TRAVIS: Or is that even her?

01:52:00.011 --> 01:52:00.844
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:52:00.844 --> 01:52:02.031
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:52:03.061 --> 01:52:05.646
TALIESIN: It seem like she has a big date tonight?

01:52:05.646 --> 01:52:06.604
TRAVIS: I mean, if you touch somebody

01:52:06.604 --> 01:52:07.701
and they're under an illusionary spell,

01:52:07.701 --> 01:52:09.417
you can tell that it's not them.

01:52:09.417 --> 01:52:10.250
LAURA: Yeah.

01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:11.629
MARISHA: Okay, it's fine.

01:52:13.711 --> 01:52:16.291
15. 16.

01:52:16.291 --> 01:52:17.399
SAM: Pretty good
MARISHA: It's okay.

01:52:17.399 --> 01:52:20.611
MATT: In the low light at this point in the day,

01:52:20.611 --> 01:52:23.111
it's a little challenging to pick up

01:52:23.111 --> 01:52:25.911
most of the details of her expressions, the physicality.

01:52:27.541 --> 01:52:29.521
It's hard to tell, but she spends

01:52:29.521 --> 01:52:31.721
a good five, six minutes or so sitting there.

01:52:31.721 --> 01:52:32.671
She just--
MARISHA: Is she crying?

01:52:32.671 --> 01:52:33.971
She's crying, isn't she?

01:52:33.971 --> 01:52:35.671
She's crying, you guys.

01:52:35.671 --> 01:52:37.351
Okay.
MATT: It's hard to tell,

01:52:37.351 --> 01:52:41.031
but you're caught off-guard as she abruptly sits up, stands,

01:52:41.031 --> 01:52:42.633
brushes herself off.

01:52:42.633 --> 01:52:45.466
(breathes deeply)

01:52:46.771 --> 01:52:49.801
And then beelines in your direction

01:52:49.801 --> 01:52:51.351
MARISHA: I hug the wall.

01:52:51.351 --> 01:52:54.421
MATT: She continues by and--

01:52:54.421 --> 01:52:55.311
MARISHA: Peek around the corner,

01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:57.041
she heading for the towers?

01:52:57.041 --> 01:53:00.851
MATT: She's heading towards the deeper exterior

01:53:00.851 --> 01:53:03.804
of where the Candles are, yeah.

01:53:05.221 --> 01:53:06.371
MARISHA: I head back.
MATT: Okay.

01:53:10.691 --> 01:53:12.761
SAM: After pickpocketing a few baubles,

01:53:12.761 --> 01:53:15.731
I'll uninvisible and then sit down

01:53:15.731 --> 01:53:18.694
if he's back sitting again, I'll rejoin Caleb.

01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:21.651
LAURA: Yeah, I'll head over, too.

01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:22.484
MATT: Okay.

01:53:22.484 --> 01:53:25.662
MARISHA: I'll meet up with Fjord in the front.

01:53:25.662 --> 01:53:28.371
SAM: Anything interesting?

01:53:28.371 --> 01:53:30.821
LIAM: Yeah, sure. A few things that were interesting.

01:53:31.881 --> 01:53:35.671
I think she will look into our request.

01:53:35.671 --> 01:53:39.003
We're probably going to need to reach out to her again.

01:53:39.003 --> 01:53:40.952
LAURA: Should I do it now?
LIAM: No.

01:53:40.952 --> 01:53:42.544
LAURA: (mid-atlantic accent) Should I do it now?

01:53:42.544 --> 01:53:45.794
(laughter)

01:53:45.794 --> 01:53:47.667
LIAM: Why, Miss Lavorre, whatever do you mean?

01:53:48.671 --> 01:53:50.761
Probably wait till tomorrow.

01:53:50.761 --> 01:53:52.611
Give her a chance to figure that out.

01:53:54.751 --> 01:53:55.674
It's not like there are--

01:53:55.674 --> 01:53:56.634
Oh, here.

01:53:56.634 --> 01:53:59.416
It's not like there are 20 of these on a wall somewhere.

01:53:59.416 --> 01:54:01.066
LAURA: You--

01:54:01.066 --> 01:54:02.921
We're all in the same boat now.

01:54:02.921 --> 01:54:04.719
If you want to keep it on, it's special to you, Caleb.

01:54:04.719 --> 01:54:06.441
LIAM: Are you using it?

01:54:06.441 --> 01:54:08.471
LAURA: I mean, all of us are.

01:54:08.471 --> 01:54:09.884
LIAM: But are you using it now?

01:54:12.171 --> 01:54:14.171
LAURA: Now I'm holding it.

01:54:14.171 --> 01:54:16.721
LIAM: Yeah, but he's peeking at you.

01:54:16.721 --> 01:54:18.441
LAURA: Well, he's peeking at all of us.

01:54:18.441 --> 01:54:19.651
Probably peeking at-- (gasps)

01:54:19.651 --> 01:54:21.471
Fjord! Should we make him wear it again

01:54:21.471 --> 01:54:22.911
'cause he's got the brand on him.

01:54:22.911 --> 01:54:24.411
SAM: I'll send a message to Fjord saying:

01:54:24.411 --> 01:54:26.365
Hey, we're just having drinks now, come back up.

01:54:26.365 --> 01:54:27.651
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Oh!

01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:28.839
Puke and rally.

01:54:30.749 --> 01:54:31.811
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over.

01:54:31.811 --> 01:54:33.661
LIAM: It's a bit like Whac-A-Mole, right?

01:54:36.065 --> 01:54:40.311
ASHLEY: Caleb, you are a very good dancer.

01:54:40.311 --> 01:54:41.771
SAM: Ooh, yes.

01:54:41.771 --> 01:54:42.604
MARISHA: Yeah, you are.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:54:42.604 --> 01:54:44.621
MARISHA: (cups clanking) Oh shit.
LAURA: You guys were pretty cozy.

01:54:44.621 --> 01:54:46.131
MARISHA: Sorry, the invisibility.

01:54:46.131 --> 01:54:48.311
Coming out of it gets wonky.

01:54:48.311 --> 01:54:49.686
SAM: Yeah, that's crazy.
LIAM: Love it. That's how that's how you come out

01:54:49.686 --> 01:54:52.352
of invisibility. Drinks go all over the table.

01:54:53.661 --> 01:54:56.411
SAM: Caleb, your hips don't lie.

01:54:56.411 --> 01:54:58.591
LIAM: Oh, she was doing most of the leading.

01:54:58.591 --> 01:55:01.142
LAURA: Yeah, we were watching.

01:55:01.142 --> 01:55:03.434
LIAM: I, ah--

01:55:03.434 --> 01:55:06.304
Town I grew up in. Everybody could dance like that.

01:55:06.304 --> 01:55:08.004
TRAVIS: What did she say? How did it go?

01:55:10.961 --> 01:55:13.521
TALIESIN: We want to maybe--? well, you know.

01:55:13.521 --> 01:55:15.416
LAURA: They had sex on the dance floor.

01:55:15.416 --> 01:55:17.611
TRAVIS: I don't believe you. No, they didn't.
LAURA: Literally.

01:55:17.611 --> 01:55:19.264
LIAM: Metaphorically, more like.

01:55:20.251 --> 01:55:23.417
They followed us?

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.571
North.

01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:27.404
LAURA: What?

01:55:28.601 --> 01:55:30.141
SAM: And do you think that meant

01:55:30.141 --> 01:55:35.141
they sent people to follow us or she herself followed us?

01:55:35.217 --> 01:55:38.445
TALIESIN: Oh! Oh.

01:55:38.445 --> 01:55:40.431
LIAM: Volstrucker.

01:55:40.431 --> 01:55:41.289
SAM: She is one, isn't she?

01:55:41.289 --> 01:55:44.172
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but she could have been delegating.

01:55:45.729 --> 01:55:47.921
I was a little distracted.

01:55:47.921 --> 01:55:50.801
TALIESIN: So all those times it may not have always been--

01:55:52.371 --> 01:55:53.861
It could have been-- oh, wow.

01:55:53.861 --> 01:55:55.412
We were being very spied on.

01:55:55.412 --> 01:55:57.725
LAURA: We're being scryed on by lots of people, huh?

01:55:57.725 --> 01:56:00.431
TRAVIS: Oh, so, some of those spheres,

01:56:00.431 --> 01:56:02.371
those eyes weren't necessarily Lucien.

01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:03.612
They could have also been--
LAURA: No wonder it feels like

01:56:03.612 --> 01:56:04.862
all the damn time.

01:56:04.862 --> 01:56:07.741
LIAM: But it also wasn't just scrying.

01:56:07.741 --> 01:56:09.611
I think that they were on the ground there.

01:56:09.611 --> 01:56:10.444
TRAVIS: Present?

01:56:10.444 --> 01:56:13.381
LIAM: Yes, they said they lost track of us

01:56:13.381 --> 01:56:15.091
once we took to the air.

01:56:15.091 --> 01:56:17.399
TRAVIS: Oh shit, they were with us for a while.

01:56:19.101 --> 01:56:21.151
LIAM: She said into the mountains, too, right?

01:56:22.371 --> 01:56:23.906
MATT: The first time you took flight

01:56:23.906 --> 01:56:27.021
was shortly after you went to your first ruin

01:56:27.021 --> 01:56:29.751
and you were choosing between the yeti village

01:56:29.751 --> 01:56:32.571
or going right over the mountain.

01:56:32.571 --> 01:56:33.431
That was the first time

01:56:33.431 --> 01:56:36.091
you transformed into birds and went over a mountain.

01:56:36.091 --> 01:56:38.361
LIAM: So it would have been then.

01:56:38.361 --> 01:56:40.517
TRAVIS: Does she know about--?

01:56:42.541 --> 01:56:45.001
LAURA: The vagina. The vagini.

01:56:45.001 --> 01:56:48.004
LIAM: Lady D is off the map for them.

01:56:49.511 --> 01:56:50.961
They do not seem to know why.

01:56:52.746 --> 01:56:55.596
And I did not get a sense they know about our old friend.

01:56:57.951 --> 01:56:58.907
MARISHA: Does she think we had a part in--

01:56:58.907 --> 01:57:01.531
LAURA: I'm going to call my vagina Lady D from now on.

01:57:01.531 --> 01:57:02.963
MARISHA: Lady D's a good word.

01:57:02.963 --> 01:57:05.171
TRAVIS: You telling just me that, or the table?

01:57:05.171 --> 01:57:06.890
LAURA: Well, I look to you and say it, but--

01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:09.051
LIAM: What is the D short for?

01:57:09.051 --> 01:57:09.884
SAM: Dick?

01:57:09.884 --> 01:57:10.717
LAURA: (laughs)

01:57:10.717 --> 01:57:11.811
MARISHA: Ready for.

01:57:11.811 --> 01:57:12.644
TALIESIN: Richard.

01:57:13.865 --> 01:57:14.965
LAURA: It's a good name.

01:57:14.965 --> 01:57:16.064
LIAM: Okay.

01:57:20.073 --> 01:57:20.906
TRAVIS: Anything else?

01:57:20.906 --> 01:57:23.881
LIAM: Blue screen, blue screen, blue screen.

01:57:23.881 --> 01:57:26.331
MARISHA: Did they report us? We being investigated?

01:57:26.331 --> 01:57:28.411
Do they think we're responsible?

01:57:28.411 --> 01:57:29.301
Or does she not know?

01:57:29.301 --> 01:57:31.364
LIAM: I mean, we are on the list, I'm sure.

01:57:33.026 --> 01:57:36.731
One of the most powerful people in the country is gone

01:57:36.731 --> 01:57:38.264
and was last seen with us.

01:57:40.718 --> 01:57:43.708
Which is partially why I wanted to loop them in

01:57:43.708 --> 01:57:45.241
at the beginning to nip that in the bud,

01:57:45.241 --> 01:57:47.474
but we do not have any good options.

01:57:50.839 --> 01:57:52.851
TALIESIN: Have they been following us since we got back?

01:57:52.851 --> 01:57:55.254
Do they know we're here? Do they know where we're going?

01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:59.225
LIAM: I do not believe so, but--

01:58:00.337 --> 01:58:01.557
LAURA: I think she said that

01:58:01.557 --> 01:58:03.157
they knew we were here.
ASHLEY: They knew we were here.

01:58:03.157 --> 01:58:04.785
LIAM: That we were here in town?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:58:04.785 --> 01:58:06.347
MATT: She did mention that.
LIAM: Thank you.

01:58:06.347 --> 01:58:07.575
You said something super quiet, and I was like,

01:58:07.575 --> 01:58:08.927
"What did he say?"

01:58:08.927 --> 01:58:10.486
MATT: Sorry, I just need--
LIAM: That's okay.

01:58:10.486 --> 01:58:11.319
MATT: (softly, close to mic) They know that you're here.

01:58:11.319 --> 01:58:13.148
TRAVIS: Caught the important part at the end.
MATT: Should've ASMRed it for you.

01:58:13.148 --> 01:58:14.848
LIAM: Yeah, I got that. I got that.

01:58:14.848 --> 01:58:16.262
TALIESIN: (whispering) Is that sandalwood?

01:58:16.262 --> 01:58:17.517
ASHLEY: (whispering) We know you're here.
TALIESIN: Carry on.

01:58:17.517 --> 01:58:19.875
LIAM: (whispering) Just a little bit of wrapping paper.

01:58:22.016 --> 01:58:22.849
SAM: Well.

01:58:24.008 --> 01:58:25.399
LAURA: Well, fuck.

01:58:26.557 --> 01:58:28.907
Are they watching us now? Are they here?

01:58:28.907 --> 01:58:30.417
SAM: We've had eyes on this whole place

01:58:30.417 --> 01:58:32.017
every moment we've been here.

01:58:32.017 --> 01:58:32.947
No one's here.

01:58:32.947 --> 01:58:34.430
LIAM: Maybe not physically on location.

01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:36.847
LAURA: Orbs. We've got to get those necklaces.

01:58:36.847 --> 01:58:38.338
LIAM: Well, we still need to--

01:58:38.338 --> 01:58:39.642
we have to do what we have to do.

01:58:39.642 --> 01:58:40.855
TALIESIN: We have to do what we have to do.

01:58:40.855 --> 01:58:42.267
LIAM: Go see your family.

01:58:42.267 --> 01:58:45.807
ASHLEY: Why are they watching us?

01:58:45.807 --> 01:58:47.807
Is there like--?

01:58:47.807 --> 01:58:52.032
LIAM: Well, Lady DeRogna <i>is</i> the Empire,

01:58:52.032 --> 01:58:53.123
or was the Empire.

01:58:53.123 --> 01:58:55.617
She was one of the nine Cerberus Assembly members.

01:58:56.507 --> 01:58:57.977
She is gone.

01:58:57.977 --> 01:59:01.717
SAM: Are you concealing the last thing that she told you,

01:59:01.717 --> 01:59:03.110
or have you told us that?

01:59:04.327 --> 01:59:05.517
LIAM: I hadn't gotten to it yet.

01:59:05.517 --> 01:59:06.350
SAM: Cool.

01:59:08.959 --> 01:59:10.466
LAURA: What else did she say?

01:59:10.466 --> 01:59:13.974
(laughter)

01:59:13.974 --> 01:59:16.422
SAM: How'd you leave things?

01:59:16.422 --> 01:59:19.007
MARISHA: What were her last words to you?

01:59:19.007 --> 01:59:20.060
LIAM: She said bye.

01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:22.292
SAM: All right.
LIAM: She said,

01:59:22.292 --> 01:59:23.849
"I need to go find an alley."
SAM: So off to Caduceus'

01:59:23.849 --> 01:59:24.737
place, then?

01:59:24.737 --> 01:59:25.570
LIAM: No, no, no.

01:59:29.017 --> 01:59:30.160
Let's just leave here.

01:59:31.326 --> 01:59:32.800
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: There's more, but let's leave here.

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:33.646
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: Okay.

01:59:34.837 --> 01:59:37.487
TRAVIS: I'll leave first and scan the streets.

01:59:37.487 --> 01:59:38.787
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:59:40.587 --> 01:59:41.807
TRAVIS: Yeah, bitch.

01:59:42.678 --> 01:59:43.715
18.

01:59:43.715 --> 01:59:45.267
MATT: 18? Not bad.

01:59:46.207 --> 01:59:49.307
Looks like the expected scattering

01:59:49.307 --> 01:59:52.577
of late night event hoppers

01:59:52.577 --> 01:59:55.357
and people finishing closing up work and business

01:59:55.357 --> 01:59:56.637
for the night.

01:59:56.637 --> 01:59:58.249
Nothing strange catches your eye.

01:59:58.249 --> 02:00:00.499
TRAVIS: It's clear.
TALIESIN: Do we want to get a room?

02:00:02.473 --> 02:00:04.426
LIAM: (inhales) Yep.

02:00:04.426 --> 02:00:05.401
TALIESIN: That's the way to do it.

02:00:05.401 --> 02:00:06.592
Let's not even leave the building.

02:00:06.592 --> 02:00:08.397
LIAM: It's a cheap room.

02:00:08.397 --> 02:00:10.067
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's smart.

02:00:10.067 --> 02:00:11.377
SAM: They rent rooms here?

02:00:11.377 --> 02:00:12.607
TALIESIN: I mean, I assume they do.

02:00:12.607 --> 02:00:15.053
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Right?

02:00:15.053 --> 02:00:17.792
SAM: I mean, not every restaurant has rooms.

02:00:18.779 --> 02:00:20.627
LIAM: Inn with a tavern?

02:00:20.627 --> 02:00:22.817
MATT: I don't believe you've had a room here before.

02:00:22.817 --> 02:00:24.677
TRAVIS: I would change location.
MATT: This is more of a social space.

02:00:24.677 --> 02:00:26.457
There is a place that you've rented here before

02:00:26.457 --> 02:00:30.050
that's towards the Mudtop Ward.

02:00:31.387 --> 02:00:32.517
LIAM: Yeah, let's do that.

02:00:32.517 --> 02:00:34.427
MARISHA: We could also go get rooms back at the Soul,

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:36.719
but it might be good to separate our location.

02:00:36.719 --> 02:00:38.011
LIAM: I think right now, yeah.

02:00:38.011 --> 02:00:38.844
MARISHA: I think so.

02:00:38.844 --> 02:00:41.332
LIAM: Just go off the grid as much as we are able to.

02:00:41.332 --> 02:00:42.290
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:44.865
LAURA: I'll just drop an oops-stone

02:00:44.865 --> 02:00:46.476
in the hall before we leave.

02:00:46.476 --> 02:00:48.597
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes. Yes.

02:00:48.597 --> 02:00:49.680
TALIESIN: We're paying for a room.

02:00:50.649 --> 02:00:52.340
LAURA: (mid-Atlantic accent) Excuse me.

02:00:53.889 --> 02:00:56.457
MARISHA: (mid-Atlantic accent)
Fiona Fancypants had some burritos.

02:00:56.457 --> 02:01:01.247
MATT: You see these two gentlemen who were eyeing you

02:01:01.247 --> 02:01:03.577
for a lot of the dancing, who've been hovering,

02:01:03.577 --> 02:01:04.977
sort of that dance hovering, looking for a way

02:01:04.977 --> 02:01:05.810
to get in there,

02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:08.607
as soon as you turn around and drop the stone,

02:01:08.607 --> 02:01:09.707
stop and go--

02:01:12.947 --> 02:01:14.481
LAURA: I wink at them. (laughs)

02:01:14.481 --> 02:01:15.869
(laughter)

02:01:15.869 --> 02:01:17.896
MATT: They're just left there, confused and like--

02:01:19.192 --> 02:01:20.617
LIAM: ♪ What is love? ♪

02:01:21.908 --> 02:01:23.592
LAURA: Oh god.
TRAVIS: I can taste it.

02:01:25.497 --> 02:01:27.407
MATT: Are you going to the previous place you rented,

02:01:27.407 --> 02:01:30.627
or are you looking for another new establishment, or?

02:01:30.627 --> 02:01:32.397
LIAM: Let's just find one in this area.

02:01:32.397 --> 02:01:35.655
LAURA: The one we rented before is close by.

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:36.655
LIAM: Is here, close by?

02:01:36.655 --> 02:01:38.217
LAURA: Right? Yeah?

02:01:38.217 --> 02:01:39.142
MATT: You guys went to find some place

02:01:39.142 --> 02:01:41.087
that was a little bit cheaper and off the path

02:01:41.087 --> 02:01:42.757
in the Mudtop Ward last time.

02:01:42.757 --> 02:01:44.247
LIAM: Let's do that.

02:01:44.247 --> 02:01:45.551
LAURA: Yeah, we'll go to the same place.

02:01:45.551 --> 02:01:47.951
TRAVIS: Veth, what does your sight do,

02:01:47.951 --> 02:01:49.887
and how long does it last?

02:01:49.887 --> 02:01:52.447
SAM: It's forever and always.
TRAVIS: Oh?

02:01:52.447 --> 02:01:54.817
SAM: I can see things that are invisible.

02:01:54.817 --> 02:01:57.027
I can see-- well, I'll check.

02:01:57.027 --> 02:01:59.467
Creatures, I believe.

02:02:01.677 --> 02:02:06.097
If I can hear, I can hear the location

02:02:06.097 --> 02:02:10.117
of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of me.

02:02:10.117 --> 02:02:12.777
So I've got to go around listening for breath, basically.

02:02:12.777 --> 02:02:14.499
TRAVIS: Got it.
LAURA: Okay, but you don't see.

02:02:14.499 --> 02:02:16.307
SAM: I don't see, I just can hear

02:02:16.307 --> 02:02:19.377
if there's some living thing near me.
LIAM: She's Daredevil.

02:02:19.377 --> 02:02:22.317
TRAVIS: As we're moving, I'll slip into an alley,

02:02:22.317 --> 02:02:23.577
summon the sword very quickly,

02:02:23.577 --> 02:02:25.987
and cast See Invisibility for the next hour,

02:02:25.987 --> 02:02:29.467
just in case we're being tailed physically.

02:02:29.467 --> 02:02:30.300
MATT: You've got it.

02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.157
Easy enough to do.

02:02:32.267 --> 02:02:34.277
MARISHA: I wanted to say earlier, as everyone's leaving,

02:02:34.277 --> 02:02:36.027
I will be the last person out,

02:02:36.027 --> 02:02:38.940
to see if any eyes trailed

02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:41.977
after Caleb or Vess as they left.

02:02:41.977 --> 02:02:42.927
MATT: Perception check.

02:02:45.817 --> 02:02:49.452
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. I think I know my-- 15.

02:02:49.452 --> 02:02:50.843
MATT: 15?
MARISHA: That's fine.

02:02:50.843 --> 02:02:55.777
MATT: Nothing piques your radar of intrigue or worry.

02:02:55.777 --> 02:02:57.377
MARISHA: Okay.

02:02:57.377 --> 02:02:59.551
MATT: A short time, you find
your way back to the Mudtop Ward.

02:02:59.551 --> 02:03:01.544
You find a small hole in the place.

02:03:01.544 --> 02:03:04.237
It's less of a major inn,

02:03:04.237 --> 02:03:08.220
and more like partially attached to stables,

02:03:09.507 --> 02:03:12.127
three table eating room,

02:03:12.127 --> 02:03:14.437
and a total of four rooms available,

02:03:14.437 --> 02:03:16.057
of which one is currently occupied.

02:03:16.057 --> 02:03:17.087
The others are available.

02:03:17.087 --> 02:03:22.027
It smells largely of hay and slop,

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:25.917
and like dried grain,

02:03:25.917 --> 02:03:27.367
that's gotten a little moldy.

02:03:28.227 --> 02:03:29.537
Not the worst,

02:03:29.537 --> 02:03:33.257
but definitely has more of an earthy atmosphere to it.

02:03:33.257 --> 02:03:34.597
But dirt cheap,

02:03:34.597 --> 02:03:35.953
each room is--

02:03:35.953 --> 02:03:36.786
LIAM: Perfect.

02:03:39.987 --> 02:03:42.480
MATT: It's one silver piece a night per room.

02:03:44.169 --> 02:03:45.002
LIAM: Okay.

02:03:45.002 --> 02:03:46.531
ASHLEY: I'll take care of this.
SAM: Want to negotiate?

02:03:46.531 --> 02:03:49.217
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, I'll take care of it, guys.

02:03:49.217 --> 02:03:52.600
TRAVIS: Before we head in the structure.

02:03:53.517 --> 02:03:56.527
Orbs, rooftop, streets,

02:03:56.527 --> 02:04:00.247
any invisible forms, spheres, anything like that?

02:04:00.247 --> 02:04:01.220
MATT: Okay.

02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.200
Make a perception check.

02:04:06.279 --> 02:04:07.112
TRAVIS: 14.

02:04:07.112 --> 02:04:08.053
MATT: 14.

02:04:09.177 --> 02:04:10.717
Nothing catching your attention.

02:04:10.717 --> 02:04:12.617
You feel pretty solid,

02:04:12.617 --> 02:04:15.150
you're not seeing anything of that sort.

02:04:16.627 --> 02:04:17.460
Okay.

02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:18.293
TRAVIS: In we go.

02:04:19.397 --> 02:04:20.747
MATT: Do you just get one room?

02:04:23.439 --> 02:04:24.839
LAURA: Yeah!

02:04:24.839 --> 02:04:26.108
LIAM: Just the one room.

02:04:26.108 --> 02:04:27.817
You heard the lady.

02:04:27.817 --> 02:04:29.140
One room, please!

02:04:30.467 --> 02:04:31.937
MATT: Easy enough done.

02:04:31.937 --> 02:04:33.547
One silver for the night.

02:04:33.547 --> 02:04:34.687
Chambers prepared.

02:04:34.687 --> 02:04:36.197
SAM: I'll take care of the payment.

02:04:36.197 --> 02:04:39.587
MATT: It's small but functional for your purposes.

02:04:39.587 --> 02:04:40.747
LIAM: Okay.

02:04:40.747 --> 02:04:44.857
All right, so once we're in, let's not even waste any time.

02:04:44.857 --> 02:04:46.107
You're ready to go?

02:04:46.107 --> 02:04:48.267
TALIESIN: No, but let's do it.

02:04:48.267 --> 02:04:52.767
LIAM: Do you have any kind of keepsake from home?

02:04:52.767 --> 02:04:53.657
SAM: We're just going to leave?

02:04:53.657 --> 02:04:55.472
Don't we have things to pick up? Shopping?

02:04:55.472 --> 02:04:57.299
Don't you want to talk to her again tomorrow?

02:04:57.299 --> 02:04:59.417
Or just go?
MARISHA: Yeah, is she going to give us stuff?

02:04:59.417 --> 02:05:00.967
LIAM: We don't know.

02:05:00.967 --> 02:05:02.457
MARISHA: So we're going to go and come back?

02:05:02.457 --> 02:05:05.760
LIAM: Well, we don't have a lot of time.

02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:08.203
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:05:08.203 --> 02:05:09.370
LIAM: So the question is,

02:05:10.487 --> 02:05:12.967
do we wait a day here in town?

02:05:12.967 --> 02:05:14.437
We could.

02:05:14.437 --> 02:05:16.907
SAM: At least to see what she says in the morning?

02:05:16.907 --> 02:05:18.037
TRAVIS: I think it might be worth it.

02:05:18.037 --> 02:05:18.967
LIAM: We could go--

02:05:18.967 --> 02:05:19.800
That's true.

02:05:21.597 --> 02:05:23.257
TALIESIN: Your call.

02:05:23.257 --> 02:05:25.507
I feel confident that home is home right now.

02:05:26.687 --> 02:05:28.377
SAM: I mean, I'm okay going and coming back,

02:05:28.377 --> 02:05:30.877
but we have no idea how long that's going to take.

02:05:31.747 --> 02:05:34.387
LIAM: Well, okay.

02:05:34.387 --> 02:05:36.547
Okay. Boy, so many things.

02:05:36.547 --> 02:05:37.570
So many things.

02:05:38.627 --> 02:05:42.490
MARISHA: Well, hang on a minute, because we left in a hurry.

02:05:44.417 --> 02:05:47.077
Where do we stand?

02:05:47.077 --> 02:05:48.410
TRAVIS: How were you feeling?

02:05:49.727 --> 02:05:51.677
MARISHA: Because I tracked her to an alley.

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:53.371
She seems real sad.

02:05:54.517 --> 02:05:55.492
TRAVIS: Sad?

02:05:55.492 --> 02:05:58.187
MARISHA: Yeah, I think she had a little breakdown,

02:05:58.187 --> 02:05:59.597
a little cry sesh.

02:05:59.597 --> 02:06:00.430
SAM: Well, wouldn't you,

02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:04.687
if you wanted to be with this amazing young man,

02:06:04.687 --> 02:06:08.097
and couldn't be because of circumstances tearing you apart?

02:06:08.097 --> 02:06:10.407
MARISHA: Absolutely, I think that could be

02:06:10.407 --> 02:06:12.900
potentially one of a dozen reasons.

02:06:14.347 --> 02:06:15.340
Feel for her, man.

02:06:17.977 --> 02:06:20.577
LIAM: She's skirted the issue of taking the old man out.

02:06:22.322 --> 02:06:23.155
MARISHA: Wait, what?

02:06:23.155 --> 02:06:24.030
SAM and MARISHA: You mean Trent?

02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:25.272
SAM: Or Ludinus?

02:06:26.997 --> 02:06:28.277
Or both?

02:06:28.277 --> 02:06:32.067
LIAM: She didn't say, but I assume she meant Trent.

02:06:32.067 --> 02:06:34.867
TRAVIS: Holy shit, Caleb.

02:06:34.867 --> 02:06:37.707
SAM: As in, she would help, or she--

02:06:37.707 --> 02:06:39.825
MARISHA: -- is suggesting it? Yeah.

02:06:39.825 --> 02:06:41.155
LIAM: She was encouraging.

02:06:42.634 --> 02:06:44.477
SAM: Then fucking let's do it.

02:06:44.477 --> 02:06:45.947
ASHLEY: Yeah, that guy's the worst.

02:06:45.947 --> 02:06:48.057
TRAVIS: What did she say?

02:06:48.057 --> 02:06:49.157
How did she phrase it?

02:06:53.261 --> 02:06:55.834
LIAM: She said that she thought this was the time,

02:06:58.067 --> 02:06:59.330
if we struck first.

02:07:05.537 --> 02:07:07.977
ASHLEY: How do you feel about that?
LAURA: Could be a trap?

02:07:07.977 --> 02:07:10.187
LIAM: Yes, it could be a trap.

02:07:10.187 --> 02:07:11.397
He could have sent her.

02:07:11.397 --> 02:07:12.407
LAURA: Yeah.

02:07:12.407 --> 02:07:15.407
If they know we are around,

02:07:15.407 --> 02:07:17.007
they think that we killed Vess,

02:07:17.007 --> 02:07:19.650
and then she sends us after Trent, too?

02:07:21.015 --> 02:07:23.187
Two Assembly members?
LIAM: You still got your stuff up?

02:07:23.187 --> 02:07:24.020
TRAVIS: I do.

02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:25.597
For an hour.

02:07:25.597 --> 02:07:27.966
How's the room that we're in?

02:07:27.966 --> 02:07:29.133
MATT: Looking around.

02:07:30.318 --> 02:07:32.507
Don't see anything that catches your worry.

02:07:32.507 --> 02:07:33.875
TALIESIN: How's the scar?

02:07:35.932 --> 02:07:37.304
TRAVIS: Ah.

02:07:37.304 --> 02:07:38.137
TALIESIN: I mean, is it glowing?

02:07:38.137 --> 02:07:39.370
TRAVIS: It's not really the scar so much

02:07:39.370 --> 02:07:41.477
as my rock-hard pecs

02:07:41.477 --> 02:07:43.497
that are still-- ah! -- throbbing.
LIAM: (slap)

02:07:43.497 --> 02:07:44.872
TALIESIN: Don't say pecs.

02:07:46.137 --> 02:07:47.856
Show the scar.

02:07:47.856 --> 02:07:50.157
LAURA: The necklace--
TRAVIS: (ripping)

02:07:50.157 --> 02:07:51.890
TALIESIN: How it keeps reforming is beyond me,

02:07:51.890 --> 02:07:53.056
but that's cool.

02:07:53.056 --> 02:07:53.930
LAURA: You think it matters?

02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:57.077
MARISHA: Just so many rippable shirts.

02:07:57.077 --> 02:07:59.237
LIAM: I feel like they could just be switching between us.

02:07:59.237 --> 02:08:00.090
It couldn't hurt.

02:08:02.395 --> 02:08:04.067
ASHLEY: I mean, what if she was--

02:08:04.067 --> 02:08:06.327
LIAM: Caleb just sort of slumps to the ground,

02:08:06.327 --> 02:08:07.267
head between his legs

02:08:07.267 --> 02:08:09.217
and sticks his own head into his hands.

02:08:10.352 --> 02:08:11.707
LAURA: It's okay, Caleb.

02:08:11.707 --> 02:08:12.837
We'll figure this out.

02:08:12.837 --> 02:08:14.897
TRAVIS: Can I just ask you straight out?

02:08:14.897 --> 02:08:17.470
I've been wanting to for forever.

02:08:18.747 --> 02:08:23.747
If you had Trent Ikithon tied to a chair,

02:08:24.037 --> 02:08:25.416
and he was powerless,

02:08:25.416 --> 02:08:28.290
and it was up to you whether he lived or died,

02:08:29.987 --> 02:08:30.987
what would you want?

02:08:34.774 --> 02:08:35.607
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:08:38.022 --> 02:08:39.122
MARISHA: Yeah?

02:08:43.046 --> 02:08:47.137
LIAM: He's everything wrong with this place.

02:08:50.817 --> 02:08:52.910
But we have so much to do right now,

02:08:54.006 --> 02:08:57.585
and I don't know what she's playing at.

02:09:00.527 --> 02:09:04.430
So, if the time was right,

02:09:06.387 --> 02:09:08.100
and circumstance would allow.

02:09:09.447 --> 02:09:12.054
Although, part of me questions

02:09:12.054 --> 02:09:15.216
if that is some part of the game

02:09:15.216 --> 02:09:17.007
that he is playing in and of itself.

02:09:20.527 --> 02:09:22.610
He's spoiled a lot of

02:09:24.210 --> 02:09:26.585
young people from this country.

02:09:28.099 --> 02:09:29.949
And he shouldn't be doing it anymore.

02:09:32.557 --> 02:09:34.087
I do have some hesitation,

02:09:34.087 --> 02:09:38.587
because I don't know what fills that vacuum.

02:09:38.587 --> 02:09:39.987
I don't know.

02:09:39.987 --> 02:09:40.820
LAURA: Astrid?

02:09:41.981 --> 02:09:43.447
TRAVIS: Eadwulf?

02:09:43.447 --> 02:09:44.280
LAURA: You?

02:09:48.837 --> 02:09:50.317
SAM: You.

02:09:50.317 --> 02:09:52.727
TRAVIS: Would you consider filling that void?

02:09:53.917 --> 02:09:54.750
LIAM: And what?

02:09:56.497 --> 02:09:57.580
Contradict the king?

02:09:59.717 --> 02:10:01.950
MARISHA: Seems like they have no problem doing it.

02:10:04.471 --> 02:10:05.787
TRAVIS: I mean, you could, in theory,

02:10:05.787 --> 02:10:08.417
affect change from the inside.

02:10:08.417 --> 02:10:10.467
This is all conceptual, of course, but...

02:10:13.667 --> 02:10:16.487
LAURA: I mean, it's possible that all this

02:10:16.487 --> 02:10:18.777
will get taken care of for us.

02:10:18.777 --> 02:10:20.078
Didn't you say, Beau, that

02:10:21.777 --> 02:10:26.540
the king was opposed to the Assembly members right now?

02:10:27.417 --> 02:10:29.117
There's infighting going in, right?

02:10:29.117 --> 02:10:30.247
MARISHA: There's a lot of infighting

02:10:30.247 --> 02:10:34.187
and a lot of incongruent information being tossed around.

02:10:34.187 --> 02:10:37.107
SAM: I don't know.
When have you ever found

02:10:37.107 --> 02:10:40.087
that the wheels of justice sort of just turn

02:10:40.087 --> 02:10:41.828
in the right direction?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:10:41.828 --> 02:10:44.917
LIAM: And the infighting has ebbed and flowed for centuries,

02:10:44.917 --> 02:10:47.647
as long as Ludinus has been in power and before.

02:10:47.647 --> 02:10:50.807
MARISHA: We're not necessarily immune to it, either.

02:10:50.807 --> 02:10:52.417
We were with Vess when she died.

02:10:52.417 --> 02:10:54.657
TRAVIS: Yeah, but Vess got picked off easy,

02:10:54.657 --> 02:10:56.787
and if Trent is out of favor,

02:10:56.787 --> 02:10:58.187
it would be quite opportune.

02:10:58.187 --> 02:11:00.977
It just also looks like an amazing way to get us

02:11:00.977 --> 02:11:03.752
to be tied to the deaths of two huge

02:11:03.752 --> 02:11:06.367
Cerberus Assembly members.
MARISHA: Absolutely.

02:11:06.367 --> 02:11:07.617
So the question is,

02:11:10.225 --> 02:11:13.108
was Astrid slumped in an alleyway crying

02:11:13.108 --> 02:11:14.622
because she misses you?

02:11:16.493 --> 02:11:19.574
Or was she slumped in an alleyway crying because

02:11:21.767 --> 02:11:23.117
she's trying to set you up?

02:11:27.357 --> 02:11:30.735
And she knows that's fucking shitty.

02:11:30.735 --> 02:11:32.027
LAURA: Should I ask her?

02:11:34.057 --> 02:11:35.307
TALIESIN: I've got a better idea.

02:11:35.307 --> 02:11:36.140
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm?

02:11:38.241 --> 02:11:42.217
TALIESIN: If we get a hold of her, she comes through,

02:11:42.217 --> 02:11:44.625
we're going to have to have one more conversation.

02:11:46.142 --> 02:11:49.512
It's the perfect opportunity for Zone of Truth.

02:11:50.597 --> 02:11:53.725
Make a room where we have to lay our cards on the table.

02:11:59.477 --> 02:12:01.947
LIAM: You got any feelings from that god of yours?

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:02.780
TALIESIN: Hmm?

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:04.830
LIAM: Got any feelings from that god of yours?

02:12:06.537 --> 02:12:10.277
LAURA: Oh, I can ask Artie.

02:12:10.277 --> 02:12:13.550
He's real good at telling when people are lying and stuff.

02:12:14.597 --> 02:12:16.072
TALIESIN: I could ask, but it's not really

02:12:16.072 --> 02:12:18.247
where we come from. It would probably--

02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:21.650
Jester's really maybe a little more inclined.

02:12:23.317 --> 02:12:26.407
LAURA: Yeah, I'll take a few minutes and cast Commune.

02:12:26.407 --> 02:12:27.240
MATT: All righty.

02:12:29.347 --> 02:12:31.165
As you all settle into this chamber,

02:12:31.165 --> 02:12:35.956
the senses grow steadily more

02:12:35.956 --> 02:12:38.839
perturbed by the aromas

02:12:38.839 --> 02:12:41.327
that seem to permeate the inside of this chamber.

02:12:41.327 --> 02:12:43.837
The stains across the wooden floor,

02:12:43.837 --> 02:12:48.837
and the furniture that tell a number of stories

02:12:49.247 --> 02:12:51.767
in parts that leave the imagination to consider

02:12:51.767 --> 02:12:53.867
where the rest of the story may have gone.

02:12:54.857 --> 02:12:57.697
But you complete the ritual, and you watch

02:12:57.697 --> 02:13:02.417
as within the central circle that you're sitting,

02:13:02.417 --> 02:13:06.717
you glance up into the ceiling of the room you are in,

02:13:06.717 --> 02:13:09.397
and Artie is up on the roof looking down at you,

02:13:09.397 --> 02:13:11.824
as his hood falls back and he goes,

02:13:11.824 --> 02:13:13.919
"Hello, dear. What is it you wanted?"

02:13:13.919 --> 02:13:16.937
And he just drifts onto the ground next to you,

02:13:16.937 --> 02:13:19.647
the cloak (whooshes), like a Batman landing.

02:13:19.647 --> 02:13:21.322
TRAVIS: We see, or just she sees?

02:13:21.322 --> 02:13:22.855
MATT: Just she sees.

02:13:22.855 --> 02:13:24.938
LAURA: Oh, just me today? Fun!

02:13:26.347 --> 02:13:27.180
Okay.

02:13:28.027 --> 02:13:31.182
So you know how Caleb was just talking to Astrid,

02:13:31.182 --> 02:13:34.297
and she was saying all these contradicting things,

02:13:34.297 --> 02:13:36.137
and saying they know that we're here.

02:13:36.137 --> 02:13:38.028
Is she setting us up for a trap?

02:13:44.187 --> 02:13:45.745
MATT: "It's challenging when individuals are

02:13:45.745 --> 02:13:47.467
"duplicitous by nature,

02:13:47.467 --> 02:13:50.847
"at least by the teachings they've undergone.

02:13:50.847 --> 02:13:55.177
"I can't straight-up tell you what a person's feeling,

02:13:55.177 --> 02:13:58.143
"but I can gather she's certainly

02:13:59.435 --> 02:14:01.099
"an opportunist."

02:14:01.099 --> 02:14:04.127
LAURA: Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:14:05.117 --> 02:14:08.112
Okay.

02:14:12.748 --> 02:14:14.173
MARISHA: That's an opportunist.

02:14:14.173 --> 02:14:15.225
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:14:15.225 --> 02:14:16.517
LAURA: I really should have thought about the things

02:14:16.517 --> 02:14:18.304
I was going to ask you before.

02:14:19.215 --> 02:14:21.907
MATT: "That's all right. You could ask me
about how my day was."

02:14:21.907 --> 02:14:23.090
LAURA: Well, hang on a second,

02:14:23.090 --> 02:14:25.073
I only get a few of these things.

02:14:25.073 --> 02:14:26.887
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:14:26.887 --> 02:14:28.147
LAURA: Hmm.

02:14:28.147 --> 02:14:29.847
Anything you guys want to ask him?

02:14:33.017 --> 02:14:34.020
MATT: Smacks your tit.

02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:36.707
TRAVIS: (howls)
(laughter)

02:14:36.707 --> 02:14:38.227
MATT: Now you all can see Artagan.

02:14:38.227 --> 02:14:39.638
(laughter)

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:41.829
TRAVIS: Fucking archfey!

02:14:42.704 --> 02:14:43.537
God!

02:14:44.770 --> 02:14:46.495
SAM: Your nipples are so raw.
MATT: "What? All the cool kids were doing it.

02:14:46.495 --> 02:14:47.328
"I'm sorry."

02:14:49.475 --> 02:14:50.591
LAURA: Oh man.

02:14:53.747 --> 02:14:54.905
SAM: Did you say, is the Grove safe?

02:14:54.905 --> 02:14:55.987
TALIESIN: Is the Grove safe for now?

02:14:55.987 --> 02:14:57.337
LAURA: Oh, is the Grove safe for now?

02:14:57.337 --> 02:14:59.469
Caduceus' home!

02:14:59.469 --> 02:15:01.914
MATT: He looks up for a second, closes his eyes.

02:15:01.914 --> 02:15:06.077
"Hmm, same musty smell it always seems to carry.

02:15:06.077 --> 02:15:09.797
"I don't think it's in any immediate danger."

02:15:09.797 --> 02:15:11.062
LAURA: That's good to know.
TALIESIN: Good to know.

02:15:11.062 --> 02:15:13.327
SAM: How about is Trent Ikithon home,

02:15:13.327 --> 02:15:15.667
or is Trent Ikithon watching us?

02:15:15.667 --> 02:15:17.074
TRAVIS: Or is he--

02:15:18.807 --> 02:15:21.587
LAURA: Is Trent-- I should say "or Ludinus,"

02:15:21.587 --> 02:15:23.340
because we need to know.

02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.813
SAM: You don't get two questions, but sure.

02:15:24.813 --> 02:15:26.505
LAURA: Well, it's one question.

02:15:26.505 --> 02:15:27.338
SAM: Yeah, sure.

02:15:27.338 --> 02:15:29.514
LAURA: You don't have to specify who, that's the problem.

02:15:29.514 --> 02:15:30.881
SAM: Is someone watching us--

02:15:30.881 --> 02:15:32.911
LAURA: No, that's a dumb question.
SAM: -- is not a good question.

02:15:32.911 --> 02:15:34.316
LAURA: I want to know if--
SAM: Everyone's watching us.

02:15:34.316 --> 02:15:35.149
SAM: Trent.

02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:37.516
TRAVIS: Would attacking Trent right now be in our favor?

02:15:37.516 --> 02:15:38.975
LAURA: Ooh, that's a good one.

02:15:38.975 --> 02:15:40.872
What he said.
SAM: He's not gonna be answering that.

02:15:40.872 --> 02:15:43.397
TRAVIS: He could be sick, he could be out of favor.

02:15:43.397 --> 02:15:47.438
LAURA: Would attacking Trent Ikithon,

02:15:47.438 --> 02:15:51.327
right now, be in our favor?

02:15:51.327 --> 02:15:53.092
MATT: "This very moment?

02:15:53.092 --> 02:15:55.592
"Likely not." (laughs)

02:15:55.592 --> 02:15:57.357
LAURA: So no.
MARISHA: Bitch.

02:15:57.357 --> 02:15:59.330
LAURA: Yes, she definitely is setting us up.

02:16:01.487 --> 02:16:02.570
How was your day?

02:16:04.147 --> 02:16:05.347
MATT: "My day was fine.

02:16:05.347 --> 02:16:08.167
"I'm just glad you decided to check in.

02:16:08.167 --> 02:16:12.687
"I'm a little bit wary of your choice in decor.

02:16:12.687 --> 02:16:15.507
"I think you're worth a lot more than this chamber.

02:16:15.507 --> 02:16:17.937
"I mean, it's a bit of a step down."

02:16:17.937 --> 02:16:19.347
LAURA: I know it's stinky in here,

02:16:19.347 --> 02:16:21.437
but we were trying to be secret.

02:16:21.437 --> 02:16:22.978
MATT: "Well, you're doing it well.

02:16:22.978 --> 02:16:24.377
"And I certainly can't be seen here.

02:16:24.377 --> 02:16:26.001
"Bye!" (whooshes)

02:16:26.001 --> 02:16:30.041
(laughter)

02:16:31.893 --> 02:16:33.309
LAURA: He's so fun, you guys.

02:16:34.957 --> 02:16:39.377
MATT: Yeah, you gather the final answer was inconclusive,

02:16:39.377 --> 02:16:40.797
taking what you're saying literally

02:16:40.797 --> 02:16:44.207
and being, "Right now this very moment, right now? No."

02:16:44.207 --> 02:16:48.107
But it's a hard question to answer.

02:16:48.107 --> 02:16:51.165
TRAVIS: I think she sees Caleb as a--

02:16:51.165 --> 02:16:51.998
LIAM: Pawn.

02:16:51.998 --> 02:16:53.182
SAM: I don't.

02:16:53.182 --> 02:16:54.517
I genuinely don't.

02:16:54.517 --> 02:16:56.417
LAURA: I think she's conflicted. I think she loves you.

02:16:56.417 --> 02:16:58.735
I think she loves you, Caleb.

02:16:58.735 --> 02:17:00.975
LIAM: I don't think she loves me, Jester.

02:17:00.975 --> 02:17:04.239
It has been a very long time since--

02:17:04.239 --> 02:17:05.420
LAURA: Do you love her?

02:17:06.747 --> 02:17:09.417
LIAM: I care for her, but

02:17:09.417 --> 02:17:11.487
that doesn't matter.

02:17:11.487 --> 02:17:12.857
LAURA: If it came down to it,

02:17:12.857 --> 02:17:17.647
and Astrid asked you to do something

02:17:17.647 --> 02:17:20.057
that went against everything you stood for now,

02:17:20.057 --> 02:17:22.029
because it would help her, would you do it?

02:17:22.029 --> 02:17:22.862
LIAM: No.

02:17:23.997 --> 02:17:26.130
LAURA: Well then, we can't trust her to do the same.

02:17:27.857 --> 02:17:29.697
TRAVIS: I think she sees Caleb as an opportunity

02:17:29.697 --> 02:17:31.127
to better her situation.

02:17:31.127 --> 02:17:33.877
Not in an evil way.

02:17:33.877 --> 02:17:37.837
I think she sees you as someone who is capable of doing

02:17:37.837 --> 02:17:38.887
what she is afraid to.

02:17:38.887 --> 02:17:39.720
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:17:40.711 --> 02:17:41.812
LIAM: It had occurred to me.

02:17:41.812 --> 02:17:45.889
Maybe we can just keep the pretense up

02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:47.673
long enough to get the favor.

02:17:48.644 --> 02:17:49.477
SAM: I--

02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:54.135
I will say that I don't like making decisions

02:17:54.135 --> 02:17:57.047
based on what we think other people are feeling,

02:17:57.047 --> 02:18:00.697
because we have no idea what's in her mind.

02:18:00.697 --> 02:18:04.217
We just got fed a bunch of bullshit by your fake god.

02:18:04.217 --> 02:18:08.300
We should make decisions based on what <i>we</i> want to do,

02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:10.687
and what we think is right.

02:18:10.687 --> 02:18:12.027
LIAM: I'm not making decisions

02:18:12.027 --> 02:18:16.097
based off of what the fey gentleman said,

02:18:16.097 --> 02:18:20.167
I'm going off of what I read on her in the moment.

02:18:20.167 --> 02:18:22.400
SAM: Which was that she can't be trusted?

02:18:24.267 --> 02:18:25.790
LIAM: She's ambitious.

02:18:29.697 --> 02:18:34.667
And I would not be shocked, if Trent were removed,

02:18:34.667 --> 02:18:37.787
if she were to fill that place,

02:18:37.787 --> 02:18:41.930
and I don't get the sense that things would improve much.

02:18:44.557 --> 02:18:48.107
SAM: I don't really care about her or what she does,

02:18:48.107 --> 02:18:51.065
or this place, or these people.

02:18:51.065 --> 02:18:52.997
All I care about is what you do,

02:18:52.997 --> 02:18:55.857
and how you control your destiny.

02:18:55.857 --> 02:18:58.297
I've heard you say that you don't want to forget

02:18:58.297 --> 02:19:02.287
about your past, and that's admirable.

02:19:02.287 --> 02:19:03.967
I've heard you say that you want to go back

02:19:03.967 --> 02:19:06.710
and fix your past, which is--

02:19:06.710 --> 02:19:07.586
LIAM: A fairytale.

02:19:07.586 --> 02:19:08.602
SAM: -- interesting.

02:19:09.597 --> 02:19:13.062
But I think the most concrete thing that you can do

02:19:13.062 --> 02:19:16.307
is seize control of your past.

02:19:17.797 --> 02:19:19.867
Go make of it what you wish.

02:19:19.867 --> 02:19:23.377
If this man wronged you, fix it.

02:19:23.377 --> 02:19:25.090
Fix him, get rid of him.

02:19:26.107 --> 02:19:29.037
Put it behind you, get closure.

02:19:29.037 --> 02:19:30.800
Burn your past.

02:19:32.587 --> 02:19:34.480
That's what you have to do for you.

02:19:36.547 --> 02:19:38.570
Not for her.

02:19:41.670 --> 02:19:43.403
LIAM: I've weighed that very thing

02:19:43.403 --> 02:19:45.369
for many, many years, Veth.

02:19:47.087 --> 02:19:49.447
And in the past, I was not strong enough to do it,

02:19:49.447 --> 02:19:51.000
or brave enough to do it.

02:19:54.218 --> 02:19:58.137
It didn't even seem like a possibility until recent time,

02:19:58.137 --> 02:20:00.950
but now we have a lot to do,

02:20:01.844 --> 02:20:03.387
that is more important than--

02:20:06.437 --> 02:20:08.247
SAM: Nothing is more important that you.

02:20:08.247 --> 02:20:12.600
LIAM: If that thing comes through a hole in the ice,

02:20:13.697 --> 02:20:16.497
there could be no more Empire, no more Dynasty, nothing.

02:20:19.237 --> 02:20:21.790
And I don't know what's happening with this, or that.

02:20:25.665 --> 02:20:28.517
I don't want to waste our time,

02:20:28.517 --> 02:20:31.230
to have us fall, on the top of the world.

02:20:32.967 --> 02:20:34.555
Yeah, I want him dead.

02:20:36.437 --> 02:20:38.803
He ruined my life.

02:20:38.803 --> 02:20:41.503
He took my life away from me.

02:20:42.521 --> 02:20:45.002
And I <i>fucking helped</i>.

02:20:53.547 --> 02:20:56.057
But I'm not going to risk all of you right now.

02:20:56.057 --> 02:20:58.537
We need to get ready, and we need to go north,

02:20:58.537 --> 02:20:59.900
and finish what we started.

02:21:03.187 --> 02:21:07.770
SAM: Is that your fear making that decision?

02:21:12.627 --> 02:21:15.569
LIAM: There are things way bigger than my

02:21:18.001 --> 02:21:19.767
personal grievances.

02:21:21.179 --> 02:21:22.637
As painful as they are.

02:21:24.847 --> 02:21:27.447
Save it for a rainy day, is all I can say right now.

02:21:29.697 --> 02:21:30.820
SAM: Every day is rainy.

02:21:33.487 --> 02:21:35.504
LAURA: When we save the world,

02:21:35.504 --> 02:21:37.287
we'll come back and kill Trent.

02:21:39.647 --> 02:21:41.573
TALIESIN: And if we don't, he'll probably die anyway.

02:21:41.573 --> 02:21:42.632
LAURA: Yeah.

02:21:42.632 --> 02:21:43.890
Silver linings!

02:21:44.827 --> 02:21:47.603
LIAM: I don't have to be the one.

02:21:49.973 --> 02:21:50.814
TALIESIN: No.

02:21:50.814 --> 02:21:52.897
LIAM: We just need something better, Caduceus.

02:21:54.235 --> 02:21:55.907
TALIESIN: I think you're making the right choice.

02:21:58.621 --> 02:22:02.654
I think there may come a time, and a place, but.

02:22:10.107 --> 02:22:10.940
LIAM: Thank you.

02:22:17.297 --> 02:22:21.097
Your concern is appreciated, truly.

02:22:21.097 --> 02:22:21.930
Thank you.

02:22:24.487 --> 02:22:28.657
For now, if you are all all right with this,

02:22:28.657 --> 02:22:30.867
we stay here tonight, like you said.

02:22:32.627 --> 02:22:35.097
We reach out for her again tomorrow,

02:22:35.097 --> 02:22:36.660
see if anything can be gleaned,

02:22:40.457 --> 02:22:41.987
and maybe some of us can have

02:22:43.257 --> 02:22:45.357
some little bit of pleasure for one night.

02:22:49.277 --> 02:22:51.017
Give me one second,

02:22:51.017 --> 02:22:52.410
says Caleb, not Liam.

02:23:04.907 --> 02:23:06.067
Okay.

02:23:06.067 --> 02:23:09.787
He pulls out Calianna's wand and sits on the ground,

02:23:09.787 --> 02:23:12.677
and starts to begin the process for creating the tower

02:23:12.677 --> 02:23:15.550
here in this shitty sheep's quarters.

02:23:16.704 --> 02:23:17.537
MATT: All right.

02:23:17.537 --> 02:23:18.370
TRAVIS: As he does that,

02:23:18.370 --> 02:23:20.212
I'll use the rest of the See invisibility

02:23:20.212 --> 02:23:23.207
to make sure nobody's watching him do that in this room.

02:23:23.207 --> 02:23:24.157
MATT: Perception check.

02:23:25.702 --> 02:23:27.307
LAURA: Guidance.

02:23:27.307 --> 02:23:28.797
TRAVIS: What does Guidance give me?

02:23:28.797 --> 02:23:29.648
MATT: An additional d4.

02:23:29.648 --> 02:23:30.981
LAURA: Additional d4.

02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:35.222
TRAVIS: Eight.

02:23:35.222 --> 02:23:36.437
SAM: Oh god.

02:23:36.437 --> 02:23:38.337
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: Thank god.

02:23:38.337 --> 02:23:40.706
MATT: Feeling pretty solid you got this place on lockdown.

02:23:40.706 --> 02:23:41.669
(laughter)

02:23:41.669 --> 02:23:43.777
TRAVIS: We airtight, fam.

02:23:43.777 --> 02:23:44.877
TALIESIN: (sighs)

02:23:49.907 --> 02:23:52.857
MATT: And with the completion of the casting,

02:23:52.857 --> 02:23:55.977
the familiar door reveals itself,

02:23:55.977 --> 02:23:59.110
the tower interior awaiting your entry.

02:23:59.967 --> 02:24:04.725
LIAM: Now, I regret to inform the majority of you,

02:24:04.725 --> 02:24:06.057
and myself,

02:24:06.057 --> 02:24:08.760
that we will in fact be sleeping in this shithole.

02:24:10.847 --> 02:24:14.150
Beauregard, Yasha, the tower is yours.

02:24:15.887 --> 02:24:18.070
MARISHA: Oh, we're doing this tonight?

02:24:19.533 --> 02:24:20.997
LIAM: We are doing this tonight.

02:24:20.997 --> 02:24:21.830
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

02:24:22.857 --> 02:24:25.017
ASHLEY: W-w-what are we doing tonight?

02:24:25.017 --> 02:24:26.577
LIAM: I push Yasha into the door.

02:24:26.577 --> 02:24:29.310
MARISHA: I pull out my fl-- Yash-- she's gone.

02:24:32.669 --> 02:24:34.094
TALIESIN: And it shuts.
LAURA: You can do this!

02:24:34.094 --> 02:24:35.057
TRAVIS: Is that a flower?

02:24:35.057 --> 02:24:36.667
TALIESIN: Gently guiding you to the door.

02:24:36.667 --> 02:24:38.968
MARISHA: I'm going to go on a date, bye!

02:24:38.968 --> 02:24:42.464
MATT: (laughs) And the door closes behind

02:24:42.464 --> 02:24:43.927
as the rest of you stand there

02:24:43.927 --> 02:24:48.485
in the rather cramped, unpleasant,

02:24:48.485 --> 02:24:50.285
but functional quarters,

02:24:50.285 --> 02:24:52.954
for your night's rest, at the behest of Caleb.

02:24:52.954 --> 02:24:54.637
LIAM: Okay.

02:24:54.637 --> 02:24:57.270
Let me put the Alarm spell on the shitty door.

02:24:57.270 --> 02:24:59.243
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, please, yeah. (laughs)

02:24:59.243 --> 02:25:01.604
MARISHA: I thought we were going to do this tomorrow night.

02:25:01.604 --> 02:25:02.679
LIAM: Yeah, I don't care.

02:25:02.679 --> 02:25:04.898
MATT: And we're going to take a break.
MARISHA: What the fuck!

02:25:04.898 --> 02:25:07.423
Because we're past break time.
MARISHA: I thought I had 45 minutes!

02:25:07.423 --> 02:25:09.924
That went on a little long, my apologies.

02:25:09.924 --> 02:25:12.504
MARISHA: 45 more minutes to think about things. Fuck.

02:25:12.504 --> 02:25:13.977
MATT: We'll come back here in a few minutes

02:25:13.977 --> 02:25:18.286
to see what the evening in the tower holds in store

02:25:18.286 --> 02:25:22.857
for these two members of the Mighty Nein.

02:25:22.857 --> 02:25:24.017
We'll see you guys in a few minutes.

02:25:24.017 --> 02:25:25.118
LIAM: Too much attention on me!

02:25:25.157 --> 02:25:28.134
Critter hug is that lighthouse, that beacon

02:25:28.135 --> 02:25:30.384
of just warm, good, fuzzy feelings

02:25:30.385 --> 02:25:33.544
that even when every Wednesday is an historical event,

02:25:32.016 --> 02:25:32.879
(lively music ends)

02:25:33.545 --> 02:25:37.334
we still have this awesome platform and space

02:25:37.335 --> 02:25:40.495
to just dedicate to pure, wholesome, good love,

02:25:40.496 --> 02:25:43.245
and send out those vibes to people who really deserve it.

02:25:43.246 --> 02:25:47.425
And I feel like that's my purpose on this planet,

02:25:47.426 --> 02:25:50.510
is to just make sure that people who need love get love.

02:25:51.463 --> 02:25:54.163
I like that, yeah.
Thank you, thank you.

02:25:54.164 --> 02:25:55.956
I'm happy to be right beside ya,

02:25:55.957 --> 02:25:58.099
getting on your coattails.

02:25:58.100 --> 02:25:59.650
I'm on your, sir.

02:26:00.937 --> 02:26:03.297
We're on to co-coattails.
There you go.

02:26:03.298 --> 02:26:04.168
Co-coattails?

02:26:04.169 --> 02:26:06.107
I want coco-coattails.

02:26:06.108 --> 02:26:07.088
Coco-coattails.
Delicious, yeah.

02:26:07.089 --> 02:26:09.257
Yeah, it's like I'm wearing half of a sleeve

02:26:09.258 --> 02:26:10.567
and then sitting on your coattail.

02:26:10.568 --> 02:26:12.477
And then you're wearing the other half of the sleeve,

02:26:12.478 --> 02:26:14.138
and then sitting on my coattail.

02:26:14.139 --> 02:26:14.972
There ya go.
We're probably gonna

02:26:14.972 --> 02:26:15.879
trip and fall a lot.

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:18.202
It's a coat ouroboros, just kind of?

02:26:20.209 --> 02:26:22.088
I was thinking coat human centipede.

02:26:22.089 --> 02:26:22.949
But that's where my mind was going.

02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:24.980
What?
I know, I'm sorry.

02:26:24.981 --> 02:26:25.814
Wow!

02:26:25.815 --> 02:26:28.647
(whimsical music)

02:26:45.664 --> 02:26:47.930
LAURA: Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:26:47.931 --> 02:26:50.588
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role's shop.

02:26:50.589 --> 02:26:52.318
(upbeat music)

02:26:52.319 --> 02:26:53.931
Ooh, look at this.

02:26:53.932 --> 02:26:55.755
Look at the details, ooh.

02:26:57.842 --> 02:27:01.526
Roll an investigation if you want, it's basically perfect.

02:27:03.653 --> 02:27:06.162
I mean the traveler always says impulse purchases

02:27:06.163 --> 02:27:07.416
are a good decision.

02:27:09.513 --> 02:27:10.912
Go ahead, darling.

02:27:10.913 --> 02:27:11.747
Treat yourself.

02:27:14.848 --> 02:27:17.515
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

02:27:20.964 --> 02:27:23.262
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:27:25.085 --> 02:27:27.368
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:27:28.265 --> 02:27:30.174
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:27:30.175 --> 02:27:31.255
You still got time.

02:27:31.256 --> 02:27:34.673
(upbeat music continues)

02:27:42.626 --> 02:27:44.785
I'm a fan of hot air balloon rides

02:27:44.786 --> 02:27:46.750
above the Venetian countryside.

02:27:48.277 --> 02:27:51.620
I'm a fan of Momlan, she's always got my back.

02:27:52.767 --> 02:27:55.160
I'm a fan of wine older than Taliesin.

02:27:58.127 --> 02:28:00.161
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

02:28:02.328 --> 02:28:04.897
I'm a fan of emotes by ArseQueef.

02:28:04.898 --> 02:28:05.731
They're neat.

02:28:07.188 --> 02:28:08.918
I'm a fan of a wife so cool.

02:28:08.919 --> 02:28:09.752
(sound distorting)

02:28:09.752 --> 02:28:10.586
People forget I exist.

02:28:10.587 --> 02:28:12.360
Exist, exist, exist.

02:28:12.361 --> 02:28:13.718
(heart beating)

02:28:13.719 --> 02:28:16.802
(cacophony of sound)

02:28:37.650 --> 02:28:38.650
I'm a fan of

02:28:40.241 --> 02:28:41.641
wearing your skin as a mask.

02:28:46.228 --> 02:28:49.061
(classical music)

02:41:23.634 --> 02:41:25.164
MATT: And welcome back.

02:41:25.164 --> 02:41:28.207
So, as we left off,

02:41:29.924 --> 02:41:33.274
the door slams shut behind Beauregard

02:41:33.274 --> 02:41:36.594
as the both of you stand in the bottom

02:41:38.704 --> 02:41:42.644
of Caleb's nein-sided tower, freshly renovated.

02:41:42.644 --> 02:41:44.094
Caleb, take it away.

02:41:44.094 --> 02:41:45.814
LIAM: Yeah, so this is Caleb's tower,

02:41:45.814 --> 02:41:49.039
so the narration will sound a little like Caleb.

02:41:49.039 --> 02:41:50.754
SAM: But with Barry White music playing in the background.

02:41:50.754 --> 02:41:51.587
LIAM: That's right.

02:41:53.744 --> 02:41:55.534
Welcome, Mighty Nein.

02:41:55.534 --> 02:41:57.614
So you are in the entryway

02:41:57.614 --> 02:41:58.994
where you have been several times.

02:41:58.994 --> 02:42:01.231
It is a very tall, nein-sided chamber.

02:42:01.231 --> 02:42:02.527
ASHLEY: Wait, is this narrated?

02:42:03.379 --> 02:42:06.472
(laughter)

02:42:06.472 --> 02:42:08.974
LIAM: Yes, from over here.

02:42:08.974 --> 02:42:09.984
No, no, it's not.
MARISHA: I sort of

02:42:09.984 --> 02:42:12.054
put in some requests to Caleb.

02:42:12.054 --> 02:42:15.524
I don't know how any of this is going to turn out.

02:42:15.524 --> 02:42:18.284
Art is subjective to interpretation, right?

02:42:18.284 --> 02:42:20.144
ASHLEY: I love art, so.

02:42:20.144 --> 02:42:21.584
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: This is perfect.

02:42:21.584 --> 02:42:23.654
MARISHA: This'll be like a weird gallery

02:42:23.654 --> 02:42:28.154
of what I wanted and what we got.

02:42:28.154 --> 02:42:29.634
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:42:29.634 --> 02:42:31.444
ASHLEY: I'm in.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:42:31.444 --> 02:42:33.954
Do you, will you go on a date with me?

02:42:33.954 --> 02:42:36.074
I thought this was going to happen earlier.

02:42:36.074 --> 02:42:38.534
I'm kind of fast-tracking things now.

02:42:38.534 --> 02:42:41.544
ASHLEY: I-- yes, I would love to go on a date with you.

02:42:41.544 --> 02:42:44.364
I was thinking this was going to happen later as well,

02:42:44.364 --> 02:42:45.664
so I'm not as prepared.

02:42:45.664 --> 02:42:47.184
MARISHA: Me neither.
ASHLEY: I didn't take a shower.

02:42:47.184 --> 02:42:48.874
MARISHA: I have really bad BO.

02:42:48.874 --> 02:42:51.464
ASHLEY: I like BO. It's great.

02:42:51.464 --> 02:42:52.927
So, I'm Xhorhasian.

02:42:53.924 --> 02:42:54.982
I can't smell.

02:42:54.982 --> 02:42:56.223
LAURA: (laughs)

02:42:57.766 --> 02:42:58.934
ASHLEY: I'm in.

02:42:58.934 --> 02:43:00.657
MARISHA: Okay!
ASHLEY: I-- wow.

02:43:00.657 --> 02:43:03.294
This feels weird that they're all sleeping out there

02:43:03.294 --> 02:43:05.534
and we're having a great time, but fuck it.

02:43:05.534 --> 02:43:06.874
MARISHA: I kind of thought this was going to happen

02:43:06.874 --> 02:43:09.944
in Nicodranas, when Veth was going to be

02:43:09.944 --> 02:43:13.152
with her husband, and Jester and Fjord

02:43:13.152 --> 02:43:14.694
would go bone somewhere, I don't know.

02:43:14.694 --> 02:43:17.714
I just-- I thought it wouldn't be, like, a thing.

02:43:17.714 --> 02:43:19.944
ASHLEY: Here you go, you're in, and everybody's outside.

02:43:19.944 --> 02:43:22.847
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
ASHLEY: But listen.

02:43:25.104 --> 02:43:29.264
I feel like-- it feels like the world

02:43:29.264 --> 02:43:31.124
is ending all the time,

02:43:31.124 --> 02:43:33.637
so we might as well.

02:43:34.814 --> 02:43:35.647
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:37.554 --> 02:43:38.944
Cheers to that.

02:43:38.944 --> 02:43:40.184
I'd love to just--
ASHLEY: Cheers.

02:43:40.184 --> 02:43:43.244
MARISHA: Get ready real quick.

02:43:43.244 --> 02:43:45.124
And I put on my bow tie.

02:43:45.124 --> 02:43:46.042
MATT: Okay.

02:43:46.042 --> 02:43:47.679
ASHLEY: I just do a quick comb

02:43:47.679 --> 02:43:49.161
with my fingers

02:43:50.661 --> 02:43:53.864
LIAM: And you hear a bell go (jingling).

02:43:53.864 --> 02:43:56.714
And right down at your feet is Frumpkin, the cat.

02:43:56.714 --> 02:43:59.374
And he has a little silver bell

02:43:59.374 --> 02:44:02.794
that you've seen Caleb use with his spellcasting before,

02:44:02.794 --> 02:44:04.894
tied with a ribbon to his tail.

02:44:04.894 --> 02:44:06.934
And he just looks up at you

02:44:06.934 --> 02:44:09.034
and turns and begins to go up the spiral stairs,

02:44:09.034 --> 02:44:13.024
up to the platform that you depart from

02:44:13.024 --> 02:44:15.407
to reach the upper regions of the tower.

02:44:16.841 --> 02:44:19.794
MARISHA: I think we should follow the hospitality staff.

02:44:19.794 --> 02:44:22.743
ASHLEY: Oh, yes. Sir, lead the way.

02:44:22.743 --> 02:44:25.441
MARISHA: Please, good Frumpkin.

02:44:25.441 --> 02:44:28.034
LIAM: When you crest the top, there is an easel

02:44:28.034 --> 02:44:30.184
with just a little note on it that says: <i>Willkommen</i>.

02:44:30.184 --> 02:44:31.551
And there are--

02:44:31.551 --> 02:44:32.714
MARISHA: There's an easel?

02:44:32.714 --> 02:44:33.644
So Airbnb.

02:44:33.644 --> 02:44:37.814
LIAM: -- sparse, not many, but black and blue flower petals,

02:44:37.814 --> 02:44:41.524
just sort of floating, rotating slowly in the column

02:44:41.524 --> 02:44:44.684
in the center of this chamber that is used

02:44:44.684 --> 02:44:47.934
for floating up to higher regions.

02:44:47.934 --> 02:44:50.311
MARISHA: I can't tell if I'm hot or cold, hang on.

02:44:50.311 --> 02:44:52.663
LIAM: Frumpkin actually starts floating up in front of you.

02:44:52.663 --> 02:44:54.634
The bell going (jingling).

02:44:54.634 --> 02:44:55.634
ASHLEY: I'm cold, but I'm sweating.

02:44:55.634 --> 02:44:56.784
MARISHA: Yeah, me, too.

02:44:56.784 --> 02:44:59.894
LIAM: And as he rises above you, the iris opens

02:44:59.894 --> 02:45:02.864
and a-- slightly different than what you've seen before,

02:45:02.864 --> 02:45:05.094
the chamber above is completely dark

02:45:05.094 --> 02:45:06.731
and Frumpkin disappears into it.

02:45:06.731 --> 02:45:08.148
(jingling)

02:45:09.647 --> 02:45:10.613
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:45:15.924 --> 02:45:17.242
MARISHA: Shall we?

02:45:17.242 --> 02:45:19.171
ASHLEY: Sorry, I thought you were giving me something.

02:45:19.171 --> 02:45:20.074
You wanted my hand.

02:45:20.074 --> 02:45:21.104
I-- it's been a minute.

02:45:21.104 --> 02:45:25.294
(laughter)

02:45:25.294 --> 02:45:30.294
ASHLEY: Wait. I grab the petals, a couple of the petals,

02:45:30.494 --> 02:45:34.397
and I put them in my book really quickly.

02:45:35.424 --> 02:45:36.987
I just wanted to save these.

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:40.941
Okay, here's my hand.

02:45:40.941 --> 02:45:42.105
MARISHA: Okay.

02:45:42.105 --> 02:45:44.772
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laughing)

02:45:46.745 --> 02:45:47.578
TRAVIS: Up!

02:45:49.648 --> 02:45:53.284
LIAM: Okay, so as the two of you slowly, hand-in-hand,

02:45:53.284 --> 02:45:55.014
float up through the open iris

02:45:55.014 --> 02:46:00.014
into the great hall above, you ascend into darkness.

02:46:00.554 --> 02:46:04.724
And you see the iris, the brass iris close beneath you.

02:46:04.724 --> 02:46:07.114
So you're in total darkness, and you feel your feet

02:46:07.114 --> 02:46:10.684
very gently just land back down on the floor,

02:46:10.684 --> 02:46:12.104
on this iris.

02:46:12.104 --> 02:46:14.264
And you're alone together, feeling each other's hands

02:46:14.264 --> 02:46:15.534
in the dark.

02:46:15.534 --> 02:46:18.494
And you see, after a brief moment,

02:46:18.494 --> 02:46:23.102
a runway of amber-colored, miniature,

02:46:23.102 --> 02:46:24.235
long-haired dachshunds

02:46:24.235 --> 02:46:26.784
come aglow in the dark,

02:46:26.784 --> 02:46:31.144
like a runway leading towards, in a path towards,

02:46:31.144 --> 02:46:34.994
one wall in this nein-sided chamber.

02:46:34.994 --> 02:46:37.394
And Frumpkin you see in this dim light

02:46:37.394 --> 02:46:38.324
just walking forward

02:46:38.324 --> 02:46:41.629
and the tail going (jingling).

02:46:41.629 --> 02:46:43.962
ASHLEY: What are these most glorious creatures?

02:46:45.534 --> 02:46:47.187
MARISHA: These are wiener dogs.

02:46:48.274 --> 02:46:50.814
I think this is a wiener red carpet.

02:46:50.814 --> 02:46:55.224
I'm trying to interpret what Caleb meant.

02:46:55.224 --> 02:46:56.704
ASHLEY: Holy shit.

02:46:56.704 --> 02:46:58.662
MARISHA: Yes.

02:46:58.662 --> 02:46:59.970
Aren't they cute?

02:46:59.970 --> 02:47:03.252
ASHLEY: I reach down and I give some scritches.

02:47:03.252 --> 02:47:05.405
And I just keep scritching as we walk.

02:47:07.022 --> 02:47:10.756
ASHLEY: And I'm gonna pick one up and hold it.
MARISHA: This is exactly what I was hoping for.

02:47:10.756 --> 02:47:12.414
LIAM: As you make your way down

02:47:12.414 --> 02:47:14.847
between these two rows of dachshunds,

02:47:15.794 --> 02:47:20.324
you see two of Caleb's globules slowly fade up in warm light

02:47:20.324 --> 02:47:21.684
when you draw close to one of the doors.

02:47:21.684 --> 02:47:24.254
And Frumpkin turns around and there is a little note

02:47:24.254 --> 02:47:26.504
hanging around his neck, and it says, "<i>Eins</i>."

02:47:29.074 --> 02:47:31.484
And you see two little amber dachsies

02:47:31.484 --> 02:47:34.714
pulling blue velvet sashes that are attached

02:47:34.714 --> 02:47:37.684
to the handles of double doors, 'cause remember there are

02:47:37.684 --> 02:47:40.654
nine sets of double doors in this chamber,

02:47:40.654 --> 02:47:43.744
and the dachsies on the ground pull apart the doors.

02:47:43.744 --> 02:47:46.644
And as they do, you see what looks almost like

02:47:46.644 --> 02:47:50.134
a rolling stage of sorts coming gently,

02:47:50.134 --> 02:47:51.894
sliding out of the closet space,

02:47:51.894 --> 02:47:55.174
but it has sections that are folded up and collapsed

02:47:55.174 --> 02:47:56.444
in weird, strange ways.

02:47:56.444 --> 02:47:58.474
And as it expands out of the closet,

02:47:58.474 --> 02:48:03.474
it begins to open up almost like a clockwork construction,

02:48:03.494 --> 02:48:05.384
or even a pop-up book.

02:48:05.384 --> 02:48:09.124
Tables and chairs fold out and lock into place

02:48:10.114 --> 02:48:11.204
in various ways.

02:48:11.204 --> 02:48:16.204
And you now are looking at a trio of tavern tables.

02:48:16.354 --> 02:48:18.224
The last thing to slide into place

02:48:18.224 --> 02:48:21.497
are a familiar-looking bar which brings in the rear.

02:48:23.274 --> 02:48:27.794
And a hanging sign that slides out, extending over, drops.

02:48:27.794 --> 02:48:31.674
And you see a sign similar to the one you remember long ago

02:48:31.674 --> 02:48:33.982
that read, "The Nestled Nook."

02:48:33.982 --> 02:48:35.307
ASHLEY: (gasps)

02:48:35.307 --> 02:48:37.914
LIAM: Now I should point out the
colors of this wooden recreation

02:48:37.914 --> 02:48:41.124
are just a little more vibrant, little more colorful

02:48:41.124 --> 02:48:43.634
than you remember, but it is unmistakably

02:48:43.634 --> 02:48:46.967
a magical fold-out recreation of the Nook.

02:48:48.014 --> 02:48:51.534
One of Caleb's globules now glow intimately

02:48:51.534 --> 02:48:53.467
over each of the three tables.

02:48:54.634 --> 02:48:58.164
You notice three bottles of Lionett vintage--

02:48:58.164 --> 02:48:59.444
MARISHA: Perfect.
LIAM: -- sitting on the bar

02:48:59.444 --> 02:49:00.574
alongside some glasses.

02:49:00.574 --> 02:49:04.248
But also you hear the turn of wheels

02:49:04.248 --> 02:49:05.940
as a little amber dachsie

02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:09.614
pulls what looks like a small sleigh on rollers,

02:49:09.614 --> 02:49:12.484
out of a hole in the back of the closet,

02:49:12.484 --> 02:49:15.654
along a track that is extended out

02:49:15.654 --> 02:49:17.694
from that hole to the bar.

02:49:17.694 --> 02:49:19.169
And the dachsie, like a little Santa,

02:49:19.169 --> 02:49:21.081
pulls a little sled out.

02:49:21.081 --> 02:49:23.744
And there are two crystal glasses on it,

02:49:23.744 --> 02:49:26.534
full of a dark, amber liquid.

02:49:26.534 --> 02:49:29.294
And there's a little folded note in front of the cocktails

02:49:29.294 --> 02:49:34.294
in Widogast's script that says, "Dark and Stormy."

02:49:34.434 --> 02:49:37.850
A nod to our goth barbarian, you surmise.

02:49:41.923 --> 02:49:42.764
ASHLEY: Oh, thank you.

02:49:42.764 --> 02:49:44.687
MARISHA: Cheers.
ASHLEY: Cheers.

02:49:46.187 --> 02:49:47.562
MARISHA: I--
ASHLEY: This is--

02:49:48.654 --> 02:49:49.584
MARISHA: No, you go first.
ASHLEY: You go.

02:49:49.584 --> 02:49:51.124
MARISHA: No, you.
ASHLEY: Shit.

02:49:51.124 --> 02:49:51.957
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:49:52.999 --> 02:49:54.441
ASHLEY: This is lovely.

02:49:56.783 --> 02:49:58.849
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (laughing)

02:49:58.849 --> 02:50:01.814
MARISHA: He really outdid himself.

02:50:01.814 --> 02:50:03.207
This is just stop one.

02:50:04.334 --> 02:50:05.807
ASHLEY: This is just stop one?

02:50:07.364 --> 02:50:09.034
MARISHA: I told Caleb,

02:50:13.054 --> 02:50:15.527
since I wanted to start over,

02:50:17.744 --> 02:50:20.017
I wanted to start <i>over</i>.

02:50:21.924 --> 02:50:25.904
So my request was a little bit of a walkthrough

02:50:27.334 --> 02:50:28.850
of where we've been,

02:50:29.975 --> 02:50:34.333
and some of our favorite hiding spots.

02:50:37.214 --> 02:50:39.164
And felt it was only appropriate to start

02:50:39.164 --> 02:50:41.007
at the Nestled Nook Inn.

02:50:44.594 --> 02:50:49.454
So these are just a little bit of, you know,

02:50:49.454 --> 02:50:52.507
pre-gaming cocktails, so don't go too crazy.

02:50:55.194 --> 02:50:56.390
ASHLEY: I chug.

02:50:56.390 --> 02:50:58.294
(laughter)

02:50:58.294 --> 02:51:00.494
LIAM: The large chamber is shrouded in darkness.

02:51:00.494 --> 02:51:04.244
The only thing lit up is this little tavern corner.

02:51:04.244 --> 02:51:05.707
All on its own, in the void.

02:51:09.184 --> 02:51:10.017
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:51:10.942 --> 02:51:12.606
ASHLEY: I like your bow tie.

02:51:12.606 --> 02:51:15.637
MARISHA: Thank you. Veth helped me pick it out.

02:51:18.274 --> 02:51:22.749
ASHLEY: Boy, I--

02:51:24.157 --> 02:51:25.690
I got something

02:51:26.764 --> 02:51:31.037
today to use for this moment, but--

02:51:32.804 --> 02:51:34.674
MARISHA: It's not that divination cream, is it?

02:51:34.674 --> 02:51:36.754
'Cause that might be toxic.

02:51:36.754 --> 02:51:39.036
ASHLEY: It is.
MARISHA: Oh!

02:51:39.036 --> 02:51:41.602
ASHLEY: But I think...

02:51:43.310 --> 02:51:44.818
it smells weird?

02:51:45.834 --> 02:51:48.187
And I think I-- (stammering)

02:51:51.504 --> 02:51:53.470
I-- (sighs).

02:51:56.854 --> 02:52:01.324
I've been trying to keep my distance from you

02:52:03.034 --> 02:52:05.764
when I found out that he was listening

02:52:05.764 --> 02:52:07.264
and they were watching.

02:52:07.264 --> 02:52:11.589
But I just--

02:52:11.589 --> 02:52:13.247
I've had a lot of people in my head,

02:52:13.247 --> 02:52:14.999
and I don't want to give them you.

02:52:16.214 --> 02:52:17.047
So.

02:52:20.824 --> 02:52:22.267
MARISHA: Are you talking about Lucien?

02:52:23.414 --> 02:52:27.747
ASHLEY: Yeah, and I just--

02:52:27.747 --> 02:52:30.172
I don't want them to see that I--

02:52:32.784 --> 02:52:35.134
That I-- fuck.

02:52:36.959 --> 02:52:37.792
MARISHA: I mean.

02:52:39.274 --> 02:52:41.784
ASHLEY: That's not what I-- that sounded weird.

02:52:41.784 --> 02:52:44.637
I don't want them to know that I care about you.

02:52:46.234 --> 02:52:50.484
Because I don't know if they're going to use that

02:52:50.484 --> 02:52:52.017
in some way, you know?

02:52:53.864 --> 02:52:54.697
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:52:56.963 --> 02:52:57.796
ASHLEY: But--

02:53:00.597 --> 02:53:01.980
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (exhale)

02:53:03.834 --> 02:53:05.694
ASHLEY: Fuck it, I guess, you know?

02:53:07.454 --> 02:53:08.754
MARISHA: I really hope you don't--

02:53:12.194 --> 02:53:16.994
I mean, clearly you do, but you shouldn't harbor any guilt

02:53:17.984 --> 02:53:22.424
about any of our previous encounters,

02:53:22.424 --> 02:53:24.597
in which you clearly weren't yourself.

02:53:30.554 --> 02:53:33.404
It's not that I'm trying to compare.

02:53:33.404 --> 02:53:35.424
And I know you've been through a lot.

02:53:35.424 --> 02:53:36.890
But...

02:53:40.432 --> 02:53:42.273
I hope you know I trust you.

02:53:46.064 --> 02:53:50.405
And I don't feel like

02:53:50.405 --> 02:53:51.634
I have any right to say

02:53:51.634 --> 02:53:53.684
that what we're going into is any different,

02:53:53.684 --> 02:53:56.064
because I don't know.

02:53:56.064 --> 02:54:01.064
I don't know Lucien's capabilities separate from

02:54:01.334 --> 02:54:03.387
Obann, or anybody else.

02:54:09.026 --> 02:54:12.144
But that, that wasn't you. And you shouldn't judge yourself

02:54:12.144 --> 02:54:13.187
as if it was.

02:54:17.104 --> 02:54:18.077
ASHLEY: I try not to.

02:54:18.974 --> 02:54:19.967
I think it's--

02:54:22.694 --> 02:54:24.707
it's getting easier.

02:54:26.394 --> 02:54:31.185
But I still

02:54:32.935 --> 02:54:37.227
am haunted every night

02:54:38.364 --> 02:54:40.384
with the look on your face when I

02:54:43.034 --> 02:54:44.127
almost killed you.

02:54:47.469 --> 02:54:48.302
But.

02:54:48.302 --> 02:54:49.427
MARISHA: I still think of

02:54:51.456 --> 02:54:53.294
the look on your face when I

02:54:55.294 --> 02:54:57.194
bruised the fuck out of your eye,

02:54:57.194 --> 02:54:58.644
punching the shit out of you.

02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:02.832
Trying to get you to snap out of it.

02:55:03.994 --> 02:55:06.788
They're not pleasant memories, Yasha.

02:55:10.794 --> 02:55:12.186
ASHLEY: It's funny, we don't have

02:55:14.474 --> 02:55:18.787
a lot of pleasant memories, it seems.

02:55:20.514 --> 02:55:24.694
But we've all come together

02:55:24.694 --> 02:55:26.557
and tried to make some.

02:55:30.884 --> 02:55:32.734
MARISHA: Here's to making some more tonight.

02:55:34.166 --> 02:55:35.257
ASHLEY: Absolutely.

02:55:40.454 --> 02:55:44.447
MARISHA: Last time we were here, in the Nestled Nook,

02:55:45.697 --> 02:55:47.267
Lucien was still Molly.

02:55:52.274 --> 02:55:54.047
ASHLEY: God, I miss him so bad.

02:56:00.184 --> 02:56:01.984
MARISHA: I don't think I ever got the story

02:56:03.224 --> 02:56:05.304
of how the two of you met.

02:56:05.304 --> 02:56:09.947
But let's save that for location number two.

02:56:11.039 --> 02:56:11.872
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:56:12.974 --> 02:56:15.318
LIAM: (bell jingling)

02:56:15.318 --> 02:56:16.684
MARISHA: Frumpkin!

02:56:16.684 --> 02:56:19.434
LIAM: There's a little note hanging under his chin

02:56:19.434 --> 02:56:20.721
and it says, "<i>Zwei</i>."

02:56:21.994 --> 02:56:23.434
And-
MARISHA: Time for number two.

02:56:23.434 --> 02:56:24.484
ASHLEY: What? Oh, that's two?

02:56:24.484 --> 02:56:26.204
Okay, <i>zwei</i>.
LIAM: The entire room

02:56:26.204 --> 02:56:29.854
goes dark again, and you sit in darkness for a moment.

02:56:29.854 --> 02:56:33.095
And little amber dachsies

02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:37.464
lead away from the tavern

02:56:37.464 --> 02:56:38.454
where you are.

02:56:38.454 --> 02:56:40.894
You surmise back towards the center of the room,

02:56:40.894 --> 02:56:44.527
and Frumpkin just strolls along, inviting you behind him.

02:56:48.454 --> 02:56:51.804
As you make your way behind the cat, you start to hear

02:56:51.804 --> 02:56:53.974
the sound of little rollers again

02:56:53.974 --> 02:56:58.974
and globules floating closer to the ceiling start to,

02:56:59.504 --> 02:57:00.984
still dim, but light up.

02:57:00.984 --> 02:57:04.864
And you see those tracks like aqueducts

02:57:04.864 --> 02:57:07.094
that run all around the walls that they--

02:57:07.094 --> 02:57:12.094
normally cats travel through-- have the dachsies

02:57:12.704 --> 02:57:13.934
running all along them.

02:57:13.934 --> 02:57:17.004
And you see a curtain or drape being pulled

02:57:17.004 --> 02:57:19.677
all around the entire room.

02:57:20.534 --> 02:57:23.384
Different pieces being stretched out until you see

02:57:24.874 --> 02:57:28.374
black and blue wildflowers painted on this backdrop

02:57:28.374 --> 02:57:31.844
surrounding you all around the room.

02:57:31.844 --> 02:57:34.644
And the curtain undulates gently,

02:57:34.644 --> 02:57:38.444
giving the effect of flowers blowing in the wind.

02:57:38.444 --> 02:57:40.574
And as you reach the center of the room,

02:57:40.574 --> 02:57:43.094
and you hear just a little more tinkle of the bell,

02:57:43.094 --> 02:57:46.584
you see a picnic blanket sitting in the center

02:57:46.584 --> 02:57:49.054
and there is a little basket

02:57:49.054 --> 02:57:51.654
with a black and blue checkered cloth in it.

02:57:51.654 --> 02:57:53.554
And there are tacos

02:57:53.554 --> 02:57:57.194
with fish and insects.

02:57:57.194 --> 02:57:58.494
Some of them still moving.

02:57:59.448 --> 02:58:00.889
ASHLEY: Oh, it's my favorite.

02:58:00.889 --> 02:58:02.074
LIAM: There is another basket

02:58:02.074 --> 02:58:04.447
with several more bottles of Lionett wine.

02:58:06.174 --> 02:58:08.214
And as you reach the picnic blanket

02:58:08.214 --> 02:58:12.344
and sit down, you see a few dachsies running

02:58:12.344 --> 02:58:13.844
in different directions across the room.

02:58:13.844 --> 02:58:18.214
And long, green silks get pulled across the entire floor.

02:58:18.214 --> 02:58:20.134
And those undulate as well.

02:58:20.134 --> 02:58:22.384
And as you sit there,

02:58:22.384 --> 02:58:25.464
it's art and pageantry, but it does create

02:58:25.464 --> 02:58:29.134
the effect of sitting in a field of wildflowers.

02:58:29.134 --> 02:58:31.504
And the globules of light are dim,

02:58:31.504 --> 02:58:32.894
and it feels like

02:58:35.154 --> 02:58:36.567
the early part of evening.

02:58:40.688 --> 02:58:41.821
ASHLEY: Wow.

02:58:47.444 --> 02:58:49.644
This is so beautiful.

02:58:49.644 --> 02:58:51.294
MARISHA: It's like living in a painting.

02:58:52.396 --> 02:58:53.506
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:58:54.503 --> 02:58:55.836
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:58:58.484 --> 02:58:59.317
Tacos?

02:59:01.934 --> 02:59:05.584
ASHLEY: My favorite. (laughs) Yes.

02:59:05.584 --> 02:59:08.824
MARISHA: I furl out the blanket.

02:59:08.824 --> 02:59:10.814
Lay it down.

02:59:10.814 --> 02:59:12.599
Crack open a bottle of wine.

02:59:12.599 --> 02:59:14.874
ASHLEY: Oh, yes, I'm very excited to try.

02:59:14.874 --> 02:59:15.954
MARISHA: This is a good year.

02:59:15.954 --> 02:59:20.774
My father, oof, he had a rough time this year.

02:59:20.774 --> 02:59:23.724
A lot of barrels wasted due to a giant flood

02:59:23.724 --> 02:59:25.094
that came into the vineyard.

02:59:25.094 --> 02:59:28.604
So only the ones that were on the topmost shelf

02:59:28.604 --> 02:59:31.044
were the ones that were able to survive, so.

02:59:31.044 --> 02:59:32.144
ASHLEY: So it's limited.

02:59:32.144 --> 02:59:33.202
MARISHA: Very few bottles of this.

02:59:33.202 --> 02:59:37.007
I mean, it seems like a magical creation.

02:59:38.035 --> 02:59:39.594
We'll see how it does.

02:59:39.594 --> 02:59:41.114
ASHLEY: I'm in.

02:59:41.114 --> 02:59:42.297
MARISHA: Pour two glasses.

02:59:44.504 --> 02:59:47.647
So how did you and Molly meet?

02:59:49.914 --> 02:59:51.139
ASHLEY: Well,

02:59:52.572 --> 02:59:55.646
when I was

02:59:58.180 --> 03:00:00.680
going through the

03:00:02.547 --> 03:00:04.129
wastes of Xhorhas,

03:00:04.129 --> 03:00:08.984
when I was not quite myself

03:00:08.984 --> 03:00:13.409
for weeks or maybe a month,

03:00:13.409 --> 03:00:15.154
however long it was, I don't know.

03:00:21.574 --> 03:00:24.477
When I finally came to,

03:00:29.334 --> 03:00:31.907
he was the first person that I saw.

03:00:38.654 --> 03:00:39.879
And...

03:00:43.188 --> 03:00:45.679
he was so beautiful.

03:00:49.924 --> 03:00:51.377
I had been in--

03:00:53.594 --> 03:00:56.814
just-- there was no color, there was no life.

03:00:56.814 --> 03:00:57.856
There was no

03:01:02.884 --> 03:01:06.564
anything out there in the wastes in Xhorhas.

03:01:06.564 --> 03:01:08.097
And then when I saw him,

03:01:13.874 --> 03:01:15.487
he was a kindred spirit.

03:01:18.564 --> 03:01:23.564
And he introduced me to everybody in the circus.

03:01:24.604 --> 03:01:29.237
And they took me in.

03:01:30.264 --> 03:01:32.704
And him and I were the best of friends.

03:01:32.704 --> 03:01:37.644
And I was weird and he was weird.

03:01:37.644 --> 03:01:39.047
We all were weird.

03:01:41.714 --> 03:01:44.644
And he just completely accepted me for who I was.

03:01:44.644 --> 03:01:49.557
And he didn't ask any questions.

03:01:55.304 --> 03:01:58.479
But he changed my life in a very big way.

03:02:02.424 --> 03:02:03.524
But that's how we met.

03:02:05.592 --> 03:02:08.342
He was the first person I saw in, I don't know,

03:02:09.354 --> 03:02:10.887
however long I was--

03:02:12.644 --> 03:02:15.994
I mean, obviously not including Obann and

03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:21.386
whatever happened with that during that time.

03:02:21.386 --> 03:02:22.219
But

03:02:24.336 --> 03:02:26.819
(sighs)

03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:29.713
that's how we met.

03:02:32.154 --> 03:02:35.497
MARISHA: I hope you feel like we've been your new circus.

03:02:36.424 --> 03:02:37.454
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:02:37.454 --> 03:02:39.247
MARISHA: Accepted by all of us weirdos.

03:02:45.524 --> 03:02:47.757
ASHLEY: Yeah, I--

03:02:48.884 --> 03:02:49.934
MARISHA: Is it not the same?

03:02:54.304 --> 03:02:57.974
ASHLEY: It is... better.

03:02:59.364 --> 03:03:00.197
MARISHA: In what way?

03:03:05.284 --> 03:03:08.547
ASHLEY: There's a closeness that we all have

03:03:08.547 --> 03:03:13.064
that I haven't experienced with a group of people

03:03:13.064 --> 03:03:14.205
like this before.

03:03:18.234 --> 03:03:20.117
I care about everyone so deeply.

03:03:21.034 --> 03:03:26.034
And I feel that love back.

03:03:28.257 --> 03:03:29.590
And

03:03:31.657 --> 03:03:34.724
I loved everyone in the circus.

03:03:34.724 --> 03:03:38.347
They were all so full of life and-- you know.

03:03:41.704 --> 03:03:44.824
But everyone in our group is family,

03:03:44.824 --> 03:03:49.174
and that's something

03:03:49.174 --> 03:03:51.087
I didn't ever quite have.

03:03:54.694 --> 03:03:56.760
MARISHA: I'll never forget

03:03:59.410 --> 03:04:01.543
seeing you for the first time

03:04:02.727 --> 03:04:04.777
at the circus, and the crazy--

03:04:05.644 --> 03:04:07.104
ASHLEY: I think I carried you?

03:04:07.104 --> 03:04:09.525
MARISHA: You did.

03:04:11.704 --> 03:04:14.074
I--
ASHLEY: Why, why did I carry you?

03:04:14.074 --> 03:04:16.115
MARISHA: Because you were trying

03:04:16.115 --> 03:04:18.894
to confiscate everyone's weapons,

03:04:18.894 --> 03:04:20.604
and I didn't want you to take my staff.

03:04:20.604 --> 03:04:24.521
So I pretended that I was injured and Jester was like,

03:04:24.521 --> 03:04:27.914
"Oh yeah, she's got a hurt leg,"

03:04:27.914 --> 03:04:29.564
ASHLEY: Oh, so I was trying to help you in.

03:04:29.564 --> 03:04:31.159
MARISHA: It was super dumb.
ASHLEY: And I, yeah, that's right.

03:04:31.159 --> 03:04:33.384
MARISHA: You saw through my bullshit real quick.

03:04:33.384 --> 03:04:37.384
ASHLEY: I-- I didn't, I thought you were hurt, I think.

03:04:37.384 --> 03:04:39.854
MARISHA: You did not.
ASHLEY: Didn't?

03:04:39.854 --> 03:04:41.994
MARISHA: There was no way.

03:04:41.994 --> 03:04:44.174
I mean, if you want to, like,

03:04:45.074 --> 03:04:48.857
make me feel good now, I'll take it.

03:04:51.164 --> 03:04:54.367
ASHLEY: I may have been distracted with things, but I--

03:04:56.294 --> 03:04:58.607
I remember when I saw all of you, it was--

03:05:01.634 --> 03:05:03.684
Boy, that day changed everything.

03:05:03.684 --> 03:05:05.484
MARISHA: It's interesting you talking about

03:05:07.394 --> 03:05:11.774
Molly being this burst of color in your monochromatic life,

03:05:11.774 --> 03:05:16.774
because part of the reason you stood out

03:05:17.221 --> 03:05:21.154
like a sore thumb is because you were this

03:05:21.154 --> 03:05:24.414
black and white and gray monochromatic vision

03:05:24.414 --> 03:05:29.147
amongst this fairytale

03:05:29.147 --> 03:05:31.174
of color.

03:05:31.174 --> 03:05:33.249
LIAM: You hear a squeaky wheel in the distance.

03:05:33.249 --> 03:05:35.365
(squeaking)

03:05:35.365 --> 03:05:37.834
And out of the darkness, one single little dachsie

03:05:37.834 --> 03:05:40.504
comes with one of those little sleds behind him.

03:05:40.504 --> 03:05:44.694
And there is a little stack of black moss cupcakes on it.

03:05:44.694 --> 03:05:46.819
And he just stops in front of Yasha, and just looks up.

03:05:46.819 --> 03:05:48.339
(panting)

03:05:48.339 --> 03:05:50.277
MARISHA: There they are, yes!

03:05:51.154 --> 03:05:52.694
Black moss cupcakes.

03:05:52.694 --> 03:05:53.964
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:05:53.964 --> 03:05:55.304
ASHLEY: This is just the greatest hits.

03:05:55.304 --> 03:05:57.184
MARISHA: Had to, you know, all the greatest hits.

03:05:57.184 --> 03:05:58.017
ASHLEY: Scritchies.

03:05:58.017 --> 03:05:59.544
MARISHA: Aren't they the best?

03:05:59.544 --> 03:06:00.945
ASHLEY: Oh, I just love them.

03:06:00.945 --> 03:06:03.464
MARISHA: Oh, these buddies!
ASHLEY: So much floof!

03:06:03.464 --> 03:06:04.716
MARISHA: I know you like dogs.

03:06:04.716 --> 03:06:05.824
ASHLEY: Aw, just love 'em.

03:06:05.824 --> 03:06:08.524
I just can't get enough, I just--

03:06:08.524 --> 03:06:10.624
MARISHA: Caleb got a little bugged out about me

03:06:10.624 --> 03:06:12.514
turning the cats into dogs.

03:06:12.514 --> 03:06:13.994
ASHLEY: Really?
MARISHA: I know.

03:06:13.994 --> 03:06:14.827
ASHLEY: Well.

03:06:14.827 --> 03:06:16.519
MARISHA: I mean, it kind of makes sense.
ASHLEY: I wish he would add them

03:06:16.519 --> 03:06:17.474
to the mix.

03:06:17.474 --> 03:06:18.824
I love cats, but dogs--

03:06:18.824 --> 03:06:20.924
I just love 'em.
MARISHA: (gasps) Like cats and dogs

03:06:20.924 --> 03:06:22.184
living together in harmony?

03:06:22.184 --> 03:06:23.197
ASHLEY: Yes.
MARISHA: That's--

03:06:24.367 --> 03:06:25.200
LIAM: Traitor.

03:06:25.200 --> 03:06:26.033
MARISHA: We should pitch that to him.

03:06:26.033 --> 03:06:27.627
LIAM: Traitors, both of you.
ASHLEY: I think so.

03:06:32.186 --> 03:06:36.811
LIAM: (wheels squeaking)

03:06:36.811 --> 03:06:40.837
MARISHA: Cheers to Black Moss cupcakes, I guess.

03:06:45.404 --> 03:06:46.554
ASHLEY: So how are you doing?

03:06:47.531 --> 03:06:50.924
(laughs) I know that's kind of a loaded question, but

03:06:53.704 --> 03:06:55.364
are you okay?
MARISHA: I'm okay.

03:06:55.364 --> 03:06:56.197
I'm okay.

03:06:57.954 --> 03:06:58.787
Yeah.

03:07:03.054 --> 03:07:05.829
Hearing the news from Yudala

03:07:07.721 --> 03:07:09.229
yesterday about

03:07:12.514 --> 03:07:17.130
how they're prosecuting the

03:07:18.980 --> 03:07:21.096
Cobalt Soul members that were responsible

03:07:21.096 --> 03:07:24.207
for my being there,

03:07:28.654 --> 03:07:29.784
I don't know.

03:07:29.784 --> 03:07:32.164
It gave me a resolve and a sense

03:07:32.164 --> 03:07:34.664
of purpose and assurance

03:07:37.184 --> 03:07:39.034
that I didn't know I was looking for.

03:07:43.364 --> 03:07:44.674
Felt like I kind of cleared away

03:07:44.674 --> 03:07:48.269
any final reservations I had with the Reserve and

03:07:51.440 --> 03:07:56.028
I mean, I'm still my regular, skeptic self, but

03:08:00.244 --> 03:08:03.644
it was good to hear that not all of bureaucracy

03:08:03.644 --> 03:08:05.494
will stand for that type of bullshit.

03:08:06.684 --> 03:08:07.517
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:08:12.917 --> 03:08:14.100
MARISHA: Hey.

03:08:20.304 --> 03:08:23.064
I just want you to know,

03:08:23.064 --> 03:08:24.867
just before we continue this,

03:08:26.474 --> 03:08:27.624
whatever this night is,

03:08:28.984 --> 03:08:31.837
that I have no expectations, and

03:08:34.984 --> 03:08:38.964
at the end of all of this, if it just--

03:08:40.864 --> 03:08:42.464
You have the reassurance of knowing

03:08:42.464 --> 03:08:44.887
that I'm somebody that you can come and talk to,

03:08:46.464 --> 03:08:49.324
if you need to and that's--

03:08:51.614 --> 03:08:52.664
That's enough for me.

03:08:56.184 --> 03:08:57.964
ASHLEY: Thank you for saying that.

03:08:57.964 --> 03:09:00.264
I--

03:09:01.394 --> 03:09:02.607
I feel the same way.

03:09:06.784 --> 03:09:08.129
But at the same time,

03:09:12.244 --> 03:09:14.744
(sighs) I--

03:09:17.444 --> 03:09:19.964
Things really changed for me

03:09:19.964 --> 03:09:21.680
when we went to Kamordah.

03:09:24.074 --> 03:09:24.907
And

03:09:28.474 --> 03:09:30.844
I saw you with your family.

03:09:30.844 --> 03:09:33.954
And I got a glimpse into

03:09:39.074 --> 03:09:41.854
how your world was when you were growing up.

03:09:41.854 --> 03:09:43.254
And I--

03:09:46.929 --> 03:09:47.762
(sighs)

03:09:50.394 --> 03:09:52.194
I fell in love with you in Kamordah.

03:09:56.184 --> 03:09:59.974
MARISHA: I look at the dachshunds behind me.

03:09:59.974 --> 03:10:02.934
ASHLEY: I just-- that just came out so fast.

03:10:02.934 --> 03:10:05.777
And I didn't know that was going to come out right then.

03:10:11.154 --> 03:10:15.594
I say that. I don't-- ooh.

03:10:17.844 --> 03:10:19.914
I don't have expectations either.

03:10:19.914 --> 03:10:24.204
But I really care about you, and

03:10:26.904 --> 03:10:29.914
I just hope, if anything, that you know

03:10:32.721 --> 03:10:35.501
I'm so proud of the person that you've become.

03:10:36.814 --> 03:10:39.657
Just seeing where you started and where you are now,

03:10:41.244 --> 03:10:43.447
you have completely done that on your own.

03:10:45.904 --> 03:10:47.404
And I just, I'm--

03:10:49.654 --> 03:10:51.067
You blow me away.

03:10:58.168 --> 03:11:00.144
MARISHA: Feeling's mutual.

03:11:05.474 --> 03:11:07.707
You could have left at any time.

03:11:11.144 --> 03:11:13.907
You kept coming back to this group.

03:11:19.184 --> 03:11:20.017
Why?

03:11:21.944 --> 03:11:22.777
ASHLEY: (sighs)

03:11:25.169 --> 03:11:27.577
You guys are the only family that I have.

03:11:29.894 --> 03:11:30.852
And I think...

03:11:35.414 --> 03:11:39.237
I am so scared.

03:11:42.954 --> 03:11:44.387
MARISHA: When I was in Kamordah,

03:11:47.534 --> 03:11:49.537
that fear of losing this family,

03:11:52.593 --> 03:11:54.251
I almost sabotaged it

03:11:56.254 --> 03:11:57.724
just so that I wouldn't have to deal

03:11:57.724 --> 03:11:59.894
with the angst and the anguish

03:12:00.874 --> 03:12:02.814
of wondering if and when

03:12:02.814 --> 03:12:05.257
and how this family will fall apart,

03:12:06.304 --> 03:12:09.017
like ripping off a bandaid that was never there,

03:12:11.844 --> 03:12:14.377
I guess over a wound that was never there.

03:12:18.154 --> 03:12:19.994
Just tried to rip it off for the pain,

03:12:19.994 --> 03:12:21.094
and nothing else.

03:12:23.194 --> 03:12:24.326
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:12:26.984 --> 03:12:28.840
That's relatable.

03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:29.673
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:31.894 --> 03:12:32.727
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:12:37.244 --> 03:12:38.837
I'm so scared to lose everyone.

03:12:40.504 --> 03:12:42.824
I think that's why I kept showing up,

03:12:42.824 --> 03:12:44.084
also trying to kill everybody,

03:12:44.084 --> 03:12:45.984
so that doesn't really make any sense.

03:12:46.984 --> 03:12:49.575
But (scoffs)

03:12:51.683 --> 03:12:55.644
I don't want to lose anyone

03:12:55.644 --> 03:12:59.637
'cause I don't know if I could survive that again.

03:13:02.294 --> 03:13:07.294
But I feel like people keep asking me,

03:13:07.381 --> 03:13:09.094
"What's your purpose?"

03:13:09.094 --> 03:13:12.181
Lucien asked me that, and I'm like, "I don't know."

03:13:13.614 --> 03:13:14.914
I feel like it's just

03:13:17.734 --> 03:13:18.717
to protect,

03:13:21.184 --> 03:13:23.197
to try to keep everybody safe and alive.

03:13:26.414 --> 03:13:28.747
MARISHA: That's why you're my favorite.

03:13:28.747 --> 03:13:32.247
ASHLEY: (laughs) Who, me?

03:13:39.268 --> 03:13:40.768
(sighs)

03:13:40.768 --> 03:13:41.909
I want to kiss you so bad.

03:13:41.909 --> 03:13:42.864
MARISHA: I want to kiss you so bad.

03:13:42.864 --> 03:13:44.544
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: I was about to ask you.

03:13:44.544 --> 03:13:46.333
ASHLEY: I jump all over her.
MARISHA: I kiss her!

03:13:46.333 --> 03:13:50.291
(cheering)

03:13:50.291 --> 03:13:53.489
(laughter)

03:13:53.489 --> 03:13:54.322
TRAVIS: There it is.

03:13:54.322 --> 03:13:58.659
MARISHA: Just like, cupcakes are on the side of the wall.

03:13:58.659 --> 03:14:01.354
ASHLEY: (laughs) Making a mess.

03:14:01.354 --> 03:14:04.674
LAURA: Seven areas left untouched.

03:14:04.674 --> 03:14:05.507
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm--

03:14:05.507 --> 03:14:08.440
No, Floofs, Floofs, get away.

03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:10.454
ASHLEY: Okay, go, go, shoo, scram.

03:14:10.454 --> 03:14:11.754
MARISHA: No, no, get, get, get...

03:14:11.754 --> 03:14:15.644
Oh, the dogs, I forgot the dogs get in your face.

03:14:15.644 --> 03:14:18.404
LIAM: But Yasha, as you guys entangle yourselves

03:14:18.404 --> 03:14:19.434
and roll all over the place,

03:14:19.434 --> 03:14:20.661
you hear a little jingle and look over,

03:14:20.661 --> 03:14:22.164
and Frumpkin is there, staring at you,

03:14:22.164 --> 03:14:24.706
with a very blank stare on his face.

03:14:24.706 --> 03:14:26.424
LAURA: I smack Caleb on the back of his head.

03:14:26.424 --> 03:14:28.090
LIAM: You're not here. I'm not controlling this!

03:14:28.090 --> 03:14:29.223
This was set going.

03:14:29.223 --> 03:14:30.304
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:14:30.304 --> 03:14:33.024
LIAM: You see another little placard hanging under

03:14:33.024 --> 03:14:34.754
Frumpkin's face, and it says "Drei",

03:14:34.754 --> 03:14:36.994
which you know very well by now from hanging out with Caleb

03:14:36.994 --> 03:14:38.964
is the Zemnian word for three.

03:14:38.964 --> 03:14:40.734
But then the card falls away,

03:14:40.734 --> 03:14:43.812
and it says the common word "die"!

03:14:43.812 --> 03:14:47.494
And all the globules of light blaze as bright as they can,

03:14:47.494 --> 03:14:50.344
and the flowery curtain all around the room

03:14:50.344 --> 03:14:52.264
drops and spills down to the floor.

03:14:52.264 --> 03:14:54.904
And all of the nine double doors in this entire room

03:14:54.904 --> 03:14:56.754
are opened and filled

03:14:56.754 --> 03:15:01.754
with what look like amber, leather-clad, humanoid figures

03:15:01.884 --> 03:15:03.734
with doberman pinscher heads!

03:15:03.734 --> 03:15:04.634
Yes, Beauregard!
ASHLEY: What!

03:15:04.634 --> 03:15:06.324
LIAM: These are the ninjas you requested!

03:15:06.324 --> 03:15:08.715
MARISHA: Yes!

03:15:08.715 --> 03:15:10.093
MATT: I need you to both roll initiative.
ASHLEY: Best date ever!

03:15:10.093 --> 03:15:12.836
(cheering)

03:15:12.836 --> 03:15:13.927
ASHLEY: Holy shit, this is the best.

03:15:13.927 --> 03:15:16.084
LIAM: It was on the list, motherfucker!

03:15:16.084 --> 03:15:18.514
ASHLEY: Shit, it's so bad, such a bad roll.
MARISHA: Okay, okay!

03:15:18.514 --> 03:15:20.224
ASHLEY: Oh, I get advantage.

03:15:20.224 --> 03:15:22.204
It's the fucking same.

03:15:22.204 --> 03:15:24.834
I rolled two nines, which is appropriate.

03:15:24.834 --> 03:15:27.174
So plus three, it's 12.

03:15:27.174 --> 03:15:28.104
MATT: 12.
MARISHA: 16.

03:15:28.104 --> 03:15:30.034
MATT: 16, all righty.

03:15:30.034 --> 03:15:32.804
So we have Beau is up first,

03:15:32.804 --> 03:15:36.814
then the dobermans, then Yasha.

03:15:36.814 --> 03:15:37.989
Beau, what are you going to do?

03:15:37.989 --> 03:15:40.457
All nine of them are now rushing in

03:15:40.457 --> 03:15:41.784
from all sides.

03:15:41.784 --> 03:15:43.884
MARISHA: So I'm kind of on top of Yasha, right?

03:15:43.884 --> 03:15:46.914
Because we were in the middle of this heated makeout.

03:15:46.914 --> 03:15:49.074
So as I'm kind of straddling her,

03:15:49.074 --> 03:15:51.107
I'm like: Sorry, babe.

03:15:52.511 --> 03:15:54.053
Gotta handle these ninjas.

03:15:54.053 --> 03:15:58.644
(laughter)

03:15:58.644 --> 03:16:02.017
MARISHA: And without really moving much,

03:16:02.017 --> 03:16:04.314
I just cartwheel off of her

03:16:04.314 --> 03:16:06.074
into a standing position.

03:16:06.074 --> 03:16:07.454
And I take out my staff,

03:16:07.454 --> 03:16:12.454
and I do a really extra flourish for no real reason,

03:16:12.474 --> 03:16:14.254
and then I go after the ninjas--

03:16:14.254 --> 03:16:15.548
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: With my staff.

03:16:15.548 --> 03:16:16.955
MATT: Go for it. You're attacking them.

03:16:16.955 --> 03:16:20.071
MARISHA: But it's really Jedi-like.

03:16:20.071 --> 03:16:21.154
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

03:16:21.154 --> 03:16:22.924
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Episode III flourish.

03:16:22.924 --> 03:16:24.749
MARISHA: Yeah, putting on--

03:16:24.749 --> 03:16:27.474
TRAVIS: (rapid lightsaber humming)

03:16:27.474 --> 03:16:29.042
MATT: Nonsensically, yeah.

03:16:29.042 --> 03:16:31.854
MARISHA: Full-on Episode III flourish, nonsensical.

03:16:31.854 --> 03:16:33.120
None of this would hit.

03:16:33.120 --> 03:16:34.170
MATT: Go for it.

03:16:34.170 --> 03:16:37.113
First one's coming at you right now. (barking)

03:16:37.113 --> 03:16:38.534
MARISHA: Oh my god, oh my god.

03:16:38.534 --> 03:16:39.829
ASHLEY: Oh, so scary.

03:16:39.829 --> 03:16:42.056
MARISHA: Oh god, that is a--

03:16:42.056 --> 03:16:45.354
And I rolled like shit for me, which is funny.

03:16:45.354 --> 03:16:46.187
17.

03:16:46.187 --> 03:16:48.454
MATT: 17 still hits.
MARISHA: All right.

03:16:48.454 --> 03:16:50.354
TRAVIS: For the doberman pinschers.
MARISHA: Next one,

03:16:50.354 --> 03:16:54.344
that's a natural 17 for a total of 29.

03:16:54.344 --> 03:16:55.604
MATT: All right, go ahead.

03:16:55.604 --> 03:16:58.448
Don't even worry about damage. (laughs)

03:16:58.448 --> 03:16:59.389
MARISHA: Pop pop.

03:16:59.389 --> 03:17:00.964
MATT: The first one rushes you, whack.

03:17:00.964 --> 03:17:02.194
You hit the first one that comes at you.

03:17:02.194 --> 03:17:03.519
As you hit it, poof.

03:17:03.519 --> 03:17:06.635
It explodes in a spray of-- would be, uh--

03:17:06.635 --> 03:17:07.468
MARISHA: Uh-huh!

03:17:07.468 --> 03:17:10.159
MATT: Black and blue glittering illusory dust.

03:17:10.159 --> 03:17:11.992
(whoosh) Off that side.

03:17:11.992 --> 03:17:12.914
MARISHA: And I just--
MATT: Second one--

03:17:12.914 --> 03:17:16.024
MARISHA: -- turn my hair in the glitter.

03:17:16.024 --> 03:17:17.584
As I look at Yasha.

03:17:17.584 --> 03:17:18.575
And I go for the second one.

03:17:18.575 --> 03:17:20.274
MATT: Whoosh!
ASHLEY: I do a fake faint.

03:17:20.274 --> 03:17:22.161
Oh my god.
(laughter)

03:17:22.161 --> 03:17:23.872
MATT: The staff goes through the
second one without even looking.

03:17:23.872 --> 03:17:25.334
That one just gets bisected.

03:17:25.334 --> 03:17:27.994
You watch as it scatters

03:17:27.994 --> 03:17:29.263
into more glitter dust around you.

03:17:29.263 --> 03:17:30.604
ASHLEY: Wow!

03:17:30.604 --> 03:17:31.934
MARISHA: I take some of the glitter dust,

03:17:31.934 --> 03:17:34.263
and I just smear it across my face.

03:17:34.263 --> 03:17:35.096
MATT: (laughs)

03:17:35.096 --> 03:17:36.744
LAURA: That's going to be there for years.

03:17:36.744 --> 03:17:39.154
(laughter)

03:17:39.154 --> 03:17:41.454
ASHLEY: Yeah, herpes of the craft world.

03:17:41.454 --> 03:17:44.280
MARISHA: Oh no, oh no, oh no!

03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:45.113
Oh, it's in my...

03:17:45.113 --> 03:17:47.104
MATT: The remaining seven come rushing in.

03:17:48.444 --> 03:17:49.754
MARISHA: A pop, pop!

03:17:49.754 --> 03:17:51.424
Flurry of Blows.

03:17:51.424 --> 03:17:53.544
MATT: Go for it.

03:17:53.544 --> 03:17:54.814
Before their turn comes.

03:17:54.814 --> 03:17:56.164
TRAVIS: Burn those ki points, go.

03:17:56.164 --> 03:17:57.520
MARISHA: All the ki points.
LIAM: Burn 'em all.

03:17:57.520 --> 03:17:59.334
You're going to bed. In theory?

03:17:59.334 --> 03:18:01.534
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs)

03:18:01.534 --> 03:18:04.254
That is a--

03:18:04.254 --> 03:18:05.395
Sorry, 20 total.

03:18:05.395 --> 03:18:06.661
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

03:18:06.661 --> 03:18:09.078
MARISHA: And a 15 total.
MATT: 15 also hits.

03:18:09.078 --> 03:18:14.078
MARISHA: Okay, so I am going to take my staff,

03:18:15.064 --> 03:18:18.144
and I do a spin, and I toss it in the air.

03:18:18.144 --> 03:18:19.958
And I go a-pop, pop!

03:18:19.958 --> 03:18:21.408
And I catch it.

03:18:21.408 --> 03:18:24.437
MATT: (impact sounds) They both
just explode into glitter dust.

03:18:25.582 --> 03:18:26.764
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:18:26.764 --> 03:18:28.264
MATT: You catch the staff mid-air.

03:18:30.884 --> 03:18:31.934
With that--
MARISHA: Babe,

03:18:31.934 --> 03:18:33.992
I might need help with these ninjas.

03:18:33.992 --> 03:18:37.247
(laughter)

03:18:37.247 --> 03:18:39.438
TALIESIN: Babe.
ASHLEY: Babe.

03:18:39.438 --> 03:18:43.332
MARISHA: Babe, babe, I got a ninja problem.

03:18:43.332 --> 03:18:45.404
ASHLEY: Let me help you exterminate.

03:18:45.404 --> 03:18:47.234
MATT: As you begin to stand up to join her,

03:18:47.234 --> 03:18:49.534
the other five come rushing in.

03:18:49.534 --> 03:18:50.984
ASHLEY: Oh, no!
MATT: Two against you.

03:18:52.891 --> 03:18:54.781
Does a 14 hit?

03:18:54.781 --> 03:18:56.254
MARISHA: It misses.

03:18:56.254 --> 03:18:57.714
MATT: Whoosh, over her head.

03:18:57.714 --> 03:18:58.913
MARISHA: Oh no!
ASHLEY: She's so strong!

03:18:58.913 --> 03:19:00.600
She's too strong!

03:19:00.600 --> 03:19:03.424
MATT: A 23, does that hit?
MARISHA: That does hit.

03:19:03.424 --> 03:19:05.741
ASHLEY: Oh no, babe!
MATT: You take one point

03:19:05.741 --> 03:19:09.084
of bludgeoning damage as one leaps, a flying kick,

03:19:09.084 --> 03:19:11.534
that hits you and just pushes your head a little bit

03:19:11.534 --> 03:19:15.321
before it kicks off. (yips and snarls)

03:19:15.321 --> 03:19:17.064
TRAVIS: Yes, it barks, yes.

03:19:17.064 --> 03:19:18.871
LIAM: They're barely unseen servants.

03:19:18.871 --> 03:19:22.412
MATT: Yeah, they are vaguely there.

03:19:22.412 --> 03:19:24.244
(laughter)

03:19:24.244 --> 03:19:25.614
MATT: The other three rush towards you.

03:19:25.614 --> 03:19:29.054
One goes to try and grapple you from behind to hold you.

03:19:29.054 --> 03:19:31.152
Make an athletics check for me.

03:19:31.152 --> 03:19:32.893
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:19:32.893 --> 03:19:34.234
That, oh.

03:19:34.234 --> 03:19:37.144
That's a 19 plus nine, so 28.

03:19:37.144 --> 03:19:40.214
MATT: It's like being held by a warm breeze.

03:19:40.214 --> 03:19:42.744
It's holding like (growls)

03:19:42.744 --> 03:19:45.284
And you're just like, it's immaterial.

03:19:45.284 --> 03:19:46.614
The other two come towards you

03:19:46.614 --> 03:19:49.707
to just unload on you with a series of blows.

03:19:50.914 --> 03:19:52.134
15?

03:19:52.134 --> 03:19:52.984
ASHLEY: It doesn't hit!

03:19:54.709 --> 03:19:55.560
MATT: 12.

03:19:55.560 --> 03:19:57.804
ASHLEY: No, it doesn't hit!

03:19:57.804 --> 03:20:00.680
MATT: Natural one!
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:20:00.680 --> 03:20:03.964
MATT: And the last one will be a 14.

03:20:03.964 --> 03:20:05.154
They are coming at you,

03:20:05.154 --> 03:20:06.694
but you are just too powerful,

03:20:06.694 --> 03:20:09.271
as these hits just tissue-paper off of you.

03:20:09.271 --> 03:20:11.504
And they're just barking and growling.

03:20:11.504 --> 03:20:12.337
You feel awesome.

03:20:12.337 --> 03:20:13.274
You feel unstoppable.

03:20:13.274 --> 03:20:14.715
It's your turn. What are you doing?
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:20:14.715 --> 03:20:16.130
LIAM: Guys, this is what little kids do.

03:20:16.130 --> 03:20:18.514
(laughter)
ASHLEY: I know.

03:20:18.514 --> 03:20:20.095
Okay, so if they're still--
SAM: Going to make out

03:20:20.095 --> 03:20:21.788
and kill some ninjas.

03:20:21.788 --> 03:20:23.417
ASHLEY: If they're grappling around me--

03:20:23.417 --> 03:20:24.544
MATT: There's one grabbing you,

03:20:24.544 --> 03:20:26.444
and there's two to the front and sides of you.

03:20:26.444 --> 03:20:28.084
ASHLEY: Okay, so what I'm going to do--

03:20:28.084 --> 03:20:30.684
MATT: Not actually grappling you, just holding onto you.

03:20:31.544 --> 03:20:33.624
ASHLEY: I am going to go into a rage.

03:20:33.624 --> 03:20:35.134
LAURA: Yes!
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:20:35.134 --> 03:20:37.374
ASHLEY: And in that rage,

03:20:37.374 --> 03:20:40.304
I'm going to look over at-- (imitates horn)

03:20:40.304 --> 03:20:42.667
I'm going to look over at Beau.

03:20:44.690 --> 03:20:46.054
Imma bamf out the wings.

03:20:46.054 --> 03:20:47.824
SAM: Yes! That's hot.
TRAVIS: Get it, get it.

03:20:47.824 --> 03:20:52.417
ASHLEY: Then I'm going to take my new sword.

03:20:52.417 --> 03:20:55.120
SAM: Oh yeah, your sword.
ASHLEY: And I'm going to just

03:20:55.120 --> 03:20:57.954
start flying around and then swinging.

03:20:57.954 --> 03:21:01.337
MATT: Go for it. Since it is not attuned to you,

03:21:01.337 --> 03:21:02.880
yeah, you're just swinging a basic sword.

03:21:02.880 --> 03:21:03.731
ASHLEY: Swinging a basic sword.

03:21:03.731 --> 03:21:05.004
MATT: But go ahead and roll for an attack, yeah.

03:21:05.004 --> 03:21:06.504
ASHLEY: Okay, am I adding anything?

03:21:06.504 --> 03:21:07.824
MATT: You're adding your strength modifier to it.

03:21:07.824 --> 03:21:09.584
ASHLEY: Strength modifier, okay.

03:21:09.584 --> 03:21:11.134
MATT: And your proficiency modifier

03:21:11.134 --> 03:21:12.594
because you are still proficient with a greatsword.

03:21:12.594 --> 03:21:14.314
So it would be proficiency plus strength.

03:21:14.314 --> 03:21:15.944
ASHLEY: Okay, so that would be, oh, wow,

03:21:15.944 --> 03:21:19.104
okay, so 26.

03:21:19.104 --> 03:21:20.744
MATT: That definitely hits.
ASHLEY: Yeah!

03:21:20.744 --> 03:21:23.934
MATT: So as you pull the wings outward,

03:21:23.934 --> 03:21:26.044
feathers scatter out

03:21:26.044 --> 03:21:27.254
and mix with the glitter

03:21:27.254 --> 03:21:29.384
that's still in the air and drifting past.

03:21:29.384 --> 03:21:31.474
You take the sword and, whoosh.

03:21:31.474 --> 03:21:34.169
As you strike through, it just passes through,

03:21:34.169 --> 03:21:35.792
and it stands there.

03:21:35.792 --> 03:21:37.342
(yelps, explosion)

03:21:37.342 --> 03:21:39.384
And just explodes into glitter.

03:21:39.384 --> 03:21:40.684
As you spin around for the second strike,

03:21:40.684 --> 03:21:41.850
go ahead and roll.

03:21:41.850 --> 03:21:43.197
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

03:21:44.994 --> 03:21:46.104
Oh, wow, okay.

03:21:46.104 --> 03:21:47.947
Why am I rolling so well right now?

03:21:49.254 --> 03:21:51.904
Okay, so--
LAURA: 'Cause you're getting laid!

03:21:51.904 --> 03:21:53.557
MARISHA: That's true.
ASHLEY: 30 total.

03:21:54.554 --> 03:21:56.845
MATT: The other one sees the blade coming and goes

03:21:56.845 --> 03:21:57.795
(snarls)

03:21:57.795 --> 03:21:59.524
And jumps in the air to try to kick towards your head.

03:21:59.524 --> 03:22:01.384
And as you do, you sweep the blade upward.

03:22:01.384 --> 03:22:04.163
And you watch it go (whimpering, explosion)

03:22:04.163 --> 03:22:07.364
into another shower of black and blue dust

03:22:07.364 --> 03:22:08.634
sparkling in the air.

03:22:08.634 --> 03:22:12.394
There is currently two left

03:22:12.394 --> 03:22:14.824
that are engaged with Beauregard.

03:22:14.824 --> 03:22:19.824
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to go over there and--

03:22:20.049 --> 03:22:21.045
(background music horn)

03:22:21.045 --> 03:22:23.346
ALL: (imitating horn)

03:22:23.346 --> 03:22:24.684
ASHLEY: I'm going to fly over to her.

03:22:24.684 --> 03:22:27.437
I'm going to grab her and pull her in.

03:22:28.284 --> 03:22:31.042
And kiss her.

03:22:31.042 --> 03:22:32.484
MARISHA: Ooh.
SAM: Yes.

03:22:32.484 --> 03:22:35.217
ASHLEY: And then flick the other two.

03:22:36.324 --> 03:22:37.984
MATT: Awesome, I'll give you a free action

03:22:37.984 --> 03:22:39.488
on that one, hell yeah.

03:22:39.488 --> 03:22:42.064
(laughter)

03:22:42.064 --> 03:22:44.134
MATT: So as they're just assailing,

03:22:44.134 --> 03:22:45.174
we'll say, for the purposes of this,

03:22:45.174 --> 03:22:46.304
you're just giving in to this?

03:22:46.304 --> 03:22:48.434
We'll say you're letting this happen?

03:22:48.434 --> 03:22:50.750
MARISHA: (scoffs) Uh, yeah.
MATT: Yeah, that's your turn.

03:22:50.750 --> 03:22:51.687
SAM: Sentinel!

03:22:51.687 --> 03:22:53.334
MATT: As you're holding her in there,

03:22:53.334 --> 03:22:54.644
they're both battering at you

03:22:54.644 --> 03:22:57.854
and having no impact as you, poof, poof.

03:22:57.854 --> 03:22:59.962
They both just detonate,

03:22:59.962 --> 03:23:03.109
(soft whooshing) as the glitter passes,

03:23:03.109 --> 03:23:04.754
and you're left there standing, holding her.

03:23:04.754 --> 03:23:06.544
As you pull back--

03:23:09.674 --> 03:23:11.260
MARISHA: We make a pretty good team.

03:23:11.260 --> 03:23:12.995
ASHLEY: Yeah, we fucking do.

03:23:12.995 --> 03:23:15.034
(laughter)

03:23:15.034 --> 03:23:15.867
ASHLEY: Do we...

03:23:17.204 --> 03:23:19.317
Do we have more stops?

03:23:20.264 --> 03:23:21.430
LIAM: (bell jingling)

03:23:21.430 --> 03:23:22.734
TRAVIS: Oh god.
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:23:22.734 --> 03:23:26.334
(laughter)

03:23:26.334 --> 03:23:28.644
MARISHA: We'll--
LIAM: The cat is there.

03:23:28.644 --> 03:23:29.764
There is a little placard.

03:23:29.764 --> 03:23:31.957
It says "<i>Vier</i>" on it.

03:23:32.994 --> 03:23:33.827
MARISHA: I look at it.

03:23:37.194 --> 03:23:41.334
LIAM: Three adjacent closets are opened by more dachshunds.

03:23:41.334 --> 03:23:44.324
And a billowing cloud of steam spills out

03:23:44.324 --> 03:23:46.384
of the center door of these three,

03:23:46.384 --> 03:23:49.644
bringing with it the scent of herbs and soap.

03:23:49.644 --> 03:23:52.124
These three new stages begin to slide out and unfold

03:23:52.124 --> 03:23:53.524
similarly to the tavern.

03:23:53.524 --> 03:23:55.054
Across the hall from you,

03:23:55.054 --> 03:23:56.484
the center stage unfolds

03:23:56.484 --> 03:24:00.244
and reveals a fairly large polished stone tub,

03:24:00.244 --> 03:24:03.644
filled with water that is steaming hot,

03:24:03.644 --> 03:24:04.754
just like this date.

03:24:04.754 --> 03:24:07.104
A few benches surround it--
ASHLEY: Ooh.

03:24:07.104 --> 03:24:08.794
LIAM: -- as well as an array of greenery

03:24:08.794 --> 03:24:11.784
displayed in planters about the water.

03:24:11.784 --> 03:24:13.944
There's a sign hanging off the lip of the stage,

03:24:13.944 --> 03:24:17.334
and it bears the familiar words "Steam's Respite."

03:24:17.334 --> 03:24:20.414
And it does in fact look like a stylized version

03:24:20.414 --> 03:24:22.784
of the bath house you visited in Zadash.

03:24:22.784 --> 03:24:25.414
The stages on the left and right

03:24:25.414 --> 03:24:26.924
are a touch more elaborate,

03:24:26.924 --> 03:24:28.894
and you hear gears clanking and turning

03:24:28.894 --> 03:24:31.824
inside the folded contraptions,

03:24:31.824 --> 03:24:34.644
extending up and broadening out.

03:24:34.644 --> 03:24:36.264
And you watch as two platforms begin

03:24:36.264 --> 03:24:39.454
to erect themselves before your eyes.

03:24:39.454 --> 03:24:40.544
Ladders fall down,

03:24:40.544 --> 03:24:43.984
and lengths of highly polished brass metal

03:24:43.984 --> 03:24:46.904
begin to extend out in segments

03:24:46.904 --> 03:24:51.224
until you see two slightly varied brass water slides

03:24:52.099 --> 03:24:54.984
that lead to the stone pool of water before you.

03:24:54.984 --> 03:24:59.344
One slide comes down in a curve to the edge of the tub.

03:24:59.344 --> 03:25:02.374
The other one is just a short little dip into space,

03:25:02.374 --> 03:25:05.614
which leads for a 10-foot drop into the water.

03:25:05.614 --> 03:25:06.604
They're a little bit different.

03:25:06.604 --> 03:25:10.824
Finally, underneath each of these two platforms--

03:25:10.824 --> 03:25:12.757
SAM: -- are parrot samurais.

03:25:12.757 --> 03:25:15.584
(laughter)

03:25:15.584 --> 03:25:17.204
LIAM: Surrounded by more greenery

03:25:17.204 --> 03:25:19.464
that is sliding into place as I speak,

03:25:19.464 --> 03:25:24.144
there are two large, apex predator <i>cats</i>.

03:25:25.100 --> 03:25:27.124
Bear with me here.

03:25:27.124 --> 03:25:31.584
A pair of massive amber lionesses

03:25:33.134 --> 03:25:35.834
sit proudly among fragrant eucalyptus leaves.

03:25:35.834 --> 03:25:37.454
And beside each of them,

03:25:37.454 --> 03:25:39.694
a straw mat rests.

03:25:39.694 --> 03:25:41.864
On one platform, there is also another easel

03:25:41.864 --> 03:25:43.497
from Caleb with a short note.

03:25:44.894 --> 03:25:46.704
Dear Beauregard,

03:25:46.704 --> 03:25:51.264
please forgive my deviating from your explicit instructions.

03:25:51.264 --> 03:25:53.004
But as a fan of rule breaking,

03:25:53.004 --> 03:25:55.587
I think you will likely permit the transgression.

03:25:56.734 --> 03:26:00.744
Besides, what better gift could I offer the Lionett?

03:26:00.744 --> 03:26:03.647
Please enjoy your massage and soak.

03:26:04.824 --> 03:26:06.324
See you tomorrow at breakfast.

03:26:07.244 --> 03:26:08.077
C. W.

03:26:11.305 --> 03:26:14.377
ASHLEY: What happens in here?

03:26:14.377 --> 03:26:15.547
Do we fight?

03:26:17.224 --> 03:26:18.437
MARISHA: We don't fight.

03:26:19.314 --> 03:26:20.471
They rub.

03:26:21.392 --> 03:26:23.334
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yes.

03:26:23.334 --> 03:26:24.207
MARISHA: Our backs.

03:26:25.124 --> 03:26:26.494
For a massage, it's a massage.

03:26:26.494 --> 03:26:29.344
He got us a massage, yes.

03:26:29.344 --> 03:26:32.784
ASHLEY: I've missed massages so much. (laughs)

03:26:32.784 --> 03:26:33.617
MARISHA: Me, too.

03:26:35.384 --> 03:26:36.217
Well,

03:26:39.554 --> 03:26:40.497
tower's ours.

03:26:43.034 --> 03:26:45.174
Claim the rest of the night with me?

03:26:45.174 --> 03:26:47.504
ASHLEY: Absolutely.

03:26:47.504 --> 03:26:50.024
MARISHA: I strip naked,

03:26:50.024 --> 03:26:52.507
go up to one of the water slides,

03:26:53.514 --> 03:26:55.314
go down into the hot tub.

03:26:56.244 --> 03:26:57.077
LIAM: It's hot.

03:26:57.077 --> 03:26:57.910
MARISHA: Ah!

03:26:59.434 --> 03:27:02.109
ASHLEY: I strip naked.

03:27:02.109 --> 03:27:04.214
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:27:04.214 --> 03:27:06.909
ASHLEY: Fly up to the top of the water slide.

03:27:06.909 --> 03:27:09.793
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Let's go, let's go.

03:27:09.793 --> 03:27:11.185
Come on.

03:27:11.185 --> 03:27:12.584
LIAM: Campaign tradition.
ASHLEY: Put 'em back in.

03:27:12.584 --> 03:27:15.084
I know I can't take them out twice.

03:27:15.084 --> 03:27:16.034
MATT: They haven't faded yet.

03:27:16.034 --> 03:27:17.665
ASHLEY: They haven't faded, okay, good.

03:27:17.665 --> 03:27:19.754
MATT: Time gets weird here for the time being,

03:27:19.754 --> 03:27:21.164
because why the fuck not?

03:27:21.164 --> 03:27:22.894
ASHLEY: And then I--

03:27:24.385 --> 03:27:29.174
I'll go down the slide sideways like this.

03:27:29.174 --> 03:27:31.544
(laughter)

03:27:31.544 --> 03:27:33.283
MARISHA: Flying through the air?
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:27:33.283 --> 03:27:36.244
(laughter)

03:27:36.244 --> 03:27:37.354
MARISHA: And then I

03:27:38.564 --> 03:27:40.684
just cuddle up into her,

03:27:40.684 --> 03:27:42.844
wrap my arms around her,

03:27:42.844 --> 03:27:44.144
give her another big kiss.

03:27:45.734 --> 03:27:47.194
LIAM: The whole room darkens

03:27:47.194 --> 03:27:50.554
as the few globules that are here dim, dim, dim, dim,

03:27:50.554 --> 03:27:53.084
and once again you're in a little, small, intimate pocket

03:27:53.084 --> 03:27:54.897
of light in this giant chamber.

03:27:55.794 --> 03:28:00.584
And then you start to see illusory fireworks

03:28:00.584 --> 03:28:02.097
in the dark above you.
ASHLEY: Oh, come on.

03:28:03.024 --> 03:28:06.224
And as you look at each other's faces in this hot tub,

03:28:06.224 --> 03:28:08.454
you see those lights reflected

03:28:08.454 --> 03:28:10.474
on each other's beautiful faces,

03:28:10.474 --> 03:28:12.987
reds and blues and greens.

03:28:14.294 --> 03:28:15.127
MARISHA: Hey.

03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:17.417
ASHLEY: Hey.

03:28:18.651 --> 03:28:19.834
MARISHA: I love you, too.

03:28:25.594 --> 03:28:27.594
ASHLEY: That's the best thing I've ever heard.

03:28:29.704 --> 03:28:33.177
MARISHA: Just lay my head on her shoulder, enjoy the show.

03:28:39.021 --> 03:28:42.447
ASHLEY: Oh, but at some point,

03:28:45.364 --> 03:28:48.055
I'm very curious about--

03:28:48.055 --> 03:28:49.754
MARISHA: The mirror?
ASHLEY: -- something in your bedroom.

03:28:49.754 --> 03:28:50.714
MARISHA: The mirror.
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes,

03:28:50.714 --> 03:28:52.154
the mirror in your bedroom.

03:28:52.154 --> 03:28:55.734
MARISHA: Bed is made whenever you're ready.

03:28:55.734 --> 03:28:57.044
ASHLEY: We'll enjoy the show first.

03:28:57.044 --> 03:28:57.877
MARISHA: Okay.

03:29:01.674 --> 03:29:02.774
We enjoy the show.

03:29:02.774 --> 03:29:04.299
MATT: All right.

03:29:04.299 --> 03:29:05.854
TRAVIS: That's a dope date night.

03:29:05.854 --> 03:29:09.124
ASHLEY: That's the best date ever.
SAM: Steam fills the camera.

03:29:09.124 --> 03:29:10.754
MARISHA: Yeah, steam, steam, steam.

03:29:10.754 --> 03:29:12.364
MATT: Steam fills the camera

03:29:14.154 --> 03:29:18.547
as the fireworks (explosions) fade off.

03:29:20.284 --> 03:29:22.367
Then we'll go ahead and finish tonight's episode there.

03:29:22.367 --> 03:29:24.842
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Aww!

03:29:24.842 --> 03:29:27.234
LAURA: As the rest of the group sits outside:

03:29:27.234 --> 03:29:28.901
It smells like farts out here.

03:29:28.901 --> 03:29:30.954
(laughter)

03:29:30.954 --> 03:29:33.014
SAM: I just, as we fall asleep,

03:29:33.014 --> 03:29:36.098
I just slap Fjord on the tit.

03:29:36.098 --> 03:29:38.431
(laughter)

03:29:39.644 --> 03:29:41.320
TRAVIS: I start to cry just a little.

03:29:43.209 --> 03:29:45.284
It's so sensitive now.

03:29:45.284 --> 03:29:47.564
LIAM: I will just throw in one last little detail

03:29:47.564 --> 03:29:49.994
because there was a chance you
were going to go to your rooms.

03:29:49.994 --> 03:29:51.424
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: And eventually you will.

03:29:51.424 --> 03:29:53.581
And eventually, you're going to ♪ fuck ♪.

03:29:53.581 --> 03:29:55.004
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I want to know everything.

03:29:55.004 --> 03:29:57.844
LIAM: But when you enter into the sitting room,

03:29:57.844 --> 03:29:59.374
not you, Yasha, but you, Beauregard,

03:29:59.374 --> 03:30:01.374
with your passive perception,

03:30:01.374 --> 03:30:04.694
notice a very slight change to the stained glass window

03:30:04.694 --> 03:30:05.554
above the fireplace,

03:30:05.554 --> 03:30:07.614
which is a picture of the Mighty Nein,

03:30:07.614 --> 03:30:10.414
their backs, staring out at a field

03:30:10.414 --> 03:30:12.177
in the Empire.

03:30:12.177 --> 03:30:14.884
And the only change, it's very minimal,

03:30:14.884 --> 03:30:17.699
is that Yasha and Beau's hands are--

03:30:17.699 --> 03:30:19.823
LAURA: Oh my god.
LIAM: -- linked together.

03:30:19.823 --> 03:30:21.114
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:30:23.474 --> 03:30:25.511
LIAM: Scene.
MARISHA and ASHLEY: (sobbing)

03:30:25.511 --> 03:30:28.178
ASHLEY: My girlfriend.
MARISHA: My girlfriend!

03:30:29.567 --> 03:30:31.264
MATT: An evening to take a moment

03:30:31.264 --> 03:30:34.474
to appreciate the reason you fight

03:30:34.474 --> 03:30:36.054
and the things worth protecting

03:30:36.054 --> 03:30:37.204
with the dangers ahead.

03:30:38.192 --> 03:30:43.192
But take a moment of respite, well earned,

03:30:43.784 --> 03:30:45.787
of connection well needed,

03:30:48.292 --> 03:30:50.637
and to take stock in what's important.

03:30:54.624 --> 03:30:56.834
Thank you all for joining us.

03:30:56.834 --> 03:30:58.094
We'll see you next week.

03:30:58.094 --> 03:30:59.624
We love you very much.

03:30:59.624 --> 03:31:02.314
And is it Thursday yet?

03:31:02.314 --> 03:31:03.147
Good night.

03:31:03.147 --> 03:31:04.499
TRAVIS: Yay, y'all hooked up!

03:31:04.499 --> 03:31:06.832
(cheering)

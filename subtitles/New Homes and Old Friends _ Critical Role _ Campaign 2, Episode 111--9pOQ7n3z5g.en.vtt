MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:01.883 --> 00:00:04.017
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:05.747
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:09.235
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:10.525
MATT: Like that.

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:11.827
Before we get into tonight's episode,

00:00:11.827 --> 00:00:12.797
we do have some quick announcements

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:14.102
to get through, beginning with our first

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:16.275
of two sponsors tonight, Skillshare.

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.192
Sam, if you don't mind.

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:22.384
TRAVIS: What?

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:23.551
LIAM: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.640
I guess he wants me to read.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.940
Oh, I have papers.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.862
This episode is sponsored by Skillshare,

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:34.920
an online learning community with thousands

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.843
of inspiring classes for curious people.

00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:40.431
TRAVIS: No?
TALIESIN: No.

00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:41.264
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:46.377
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.
TRAVIS: I guess I'm supposed to

00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:48.725
read in a French accent?

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.512
Okay.
MATT: This is awful.

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:54.204
TRAVIS: (exaggerated French accent)
Skillshare offers amazing classes

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:58.512
designed for real life, including graphic design,

00:00:58.512 --> 00:00:59.796
photography

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.276
and music.

00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:04.629
(normal voice) Oh god.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.549
(laughter)

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.153
TRAVIS: (French accent) Sadly,
the one class Sam could not find

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:10.544
on this site was miming,

00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:12.406
(normal voice) which is why he's terrible at it.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:17.131
Go on, Sam, why don't you mime juggling chainsaws?

00:01:21.627 --> 00:01:22.867
(laughs)

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:26.200
What about driving in rush hour traffic?

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.565
(laughter)

00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:30.398
TALIESIN: 10 and two.

00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:32.378
TRAVIS: (French accent) Yeah, that's truly terrible,

00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:34.086
but don't let that dissuade you.

00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:36.469
With memberships as low as $10 a month,

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.182
with annual subscription.
LAURA: (laughs)

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.015
TRAVIS: Boy.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:42.739
Skillshare is a great way to learn

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.720
and unlock your creativity.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.078
LAURA: (French accent) Be our guest!

00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:47.550
TRAVIS: Sam,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.383
why don't you try needing to poop with no toilet in sight?

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:57.014
(laughter)

00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:59.835
TRAVIS: Or how about being birthed by a rhino?

00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:01.488
(laughter)

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.228
TRAVIS: Being birthed by a rhino.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:05.327
LIAM: What?

00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:06.599
ASHLEY: Burped.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.889
TRAVIS: Get through, make it through.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.139
(laughter)

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.599
TRAVIS: Well done, <i>monsieur</i>.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.799
Go check out Skillshare for yourself now

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.527
at skl.sh/criticalrole4,

00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:24.314
and thanks for their continued support.

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:25.980
LAURA: Woo!

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.873
That was amazing.

00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:28.164
LIAM: Fucking nightmare fuel.

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:30.577
TRAVIS: Bravo, bravo, <i>monsieur</i>.

00:02:30.577 --> 00:02:32.860
LAURA: Why don't you ever get
cast for your French accent, baby?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.097
That was amazing.
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

00:02:35.097 --> 00:02:37.548
LAURA: Wow.
TRAVIS: That was just awful.

00:02:37.548 --> 00:02:38.945
MATT: I don't know why, but certain expressions,

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:40.817
I went straight to Devil's Rejects.

00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:41.811
(laughter)

00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.508
MATT: With that makeup, it's--

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:46.137
I am not going to sleep well tonight, thank you, Sam.

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:48.526
And I'm sorry, Skillshare.

00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:50.678
Our second sponsor, our returning friends,

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:52.446
every episode from the beginning of the campaign,

00:02:52.446 --> 00:02:53.607
D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.062
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:02:55.062 --> 00:02:57.438
MATT: Of which, now you can add a whole unique selection

00:02:57.438 --> 00:02:59.740
of digital dice to your D&amp;D Beyond account,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.878
which is awesome.

00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:04.290
It says here, roll using the finest 64-bit metals,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.500
with the blacksmith pack, or unleash the power of Medusa

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.854
on every natural 20, using the mythic dice set.

00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:12.750
Each dice set is unique and integrated

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.953
with the D&amp;D Beyond character sheet,

00:03:13.953 --> 00:03:16.278
so you can roll them with a simple click of any stat,

00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:17.677
which is actually pretty cool.

00:03:17.677 --> 00:03:20.425
I prefer the physicality of the dice, personally,

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:21.637
but then I saw the actual digital stuff,

00:03:21.637 --> 00:03:22.878
was like, yeah, that's actually pretty bad ass,

00:03:22.878 --> 00:03:24.022
especially for online stuff.
LAURA: Yeah, the digital stuff

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:25.400
is really awesome.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.246
MATT: So check out these digital dice sets now

00:03:27.246 --> 00:03:32.246
and more at dndbeyond.link/crdice.

00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:36.264
Okay, Marisha, you have some announcements, I believe.

00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:38.022
MARISHA: I do?

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.094
Do I now?

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:42.016
(laughter)

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:42.849
TRAVIS: Keep it going.

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.834
LIAM: Oh boy, another Sam bit. I love these.
MARISHA: Wow, that's not right.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:46.945
MATT: Hey!

00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:50.108
MARISHA: I'm assuming my announcement is--

00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:52.434
MATT: (whispering) Talks on September 29th, 7:00pm Pacific.

00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:54.408
MARISHA: What? Talks?

00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:57.510
Yeah, Talks, that's the 29th? At 7:00pm?

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.343
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:00.640
MARISHA: On Tuesday, you know?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.807
When Talks is.

00:04:03.207 --> 00:04:04.609
And it's happening again!

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.743
MATT: Episode 111.

00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:08.519
MARISHA: It's covering episode 111.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.008
MATT: Be available on YouTube Thursday.

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:14.076
MARISHA: And it will totally be
available on YouTube on Thursday.

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:14.909
MATT: And the Critical Role Podcast Network.

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:15.928
MARISHA: And the Critical Role

00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:19.578
Podcast Network, of course, you know, 36 hours--

00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:20.703
TRAVIS: Do it in a French accent.

00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:23.568
MARISHA: ("French" accent) In 36 hours!

00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:25.451
MATT: Oh yeah!
LIAM: Wow.

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:27.474
TRAVIS: Arguably better than mine.

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:29.062
Arguably better.

00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:30.212
MATT: (laughs)

00:04:30.212 --> 00:04:32.681
MARISHA: Yeah, Talks, it's back still.

00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:33.914
LAURA: Woo!

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:35.656
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Marisha, well done.

00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:36.654
MARISHA: Thank you!

00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:40.014
LIAM: We got mime and ventriloquism.

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:41.126
MATT: That's what we're here for.

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:44.347
ASHLEY: Why didn't you ask me to do the French accent?

00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:47.540
With how amazing I am at-- oh, okay.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.160
LAURA: The whole game tonight.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.826
LIAM: Now, you got to.

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:51.739
MATT: All righty.

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:54.783
And we do have one final announcement,

00:04:54.783 --> 00:04:56.725
a pretty sizable announcement.

00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:58.352
Ashley, if you wouldn't mind taking it away.

00:04:58.352 --> 00:05:00.944
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:05:00.944 --> 00:05:05.114
So, since we started Critical Role,

00:05:05.114 --> 00:05:08.704
we all have been absolutely blown away

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:10.954
by this community's support,

00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:14.531
and especially when it comes to charity campaigns.

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:19.531
So today, we are excited to announce the launch

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:21.868
of Critical Role Foundation!

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:25.298
(cheering)
(clapping)

00:05:25.298 --> 00:05:29.033
So it's a nonprofit organization with a mission statement

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:31.749
that I'm sure some of you will recognize,

00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:35.007
to leave the world better than we found it.

00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:35.840
TRAVIS: Hell yeah.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.840
ASHLEY: So am very excited to serve as the President of CRF,

00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:44.664
with Matt as our board member.

00:05:46.006 --> 00:05:47.361
MATT: One of a number, but the one here.

00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:49.917
ASHLEY: Yes, the one here, present.

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:50.750
Yes.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.681
Okay, so for our first campaign,

00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:55.852
we have partnered with one of my favorite organizations,

00:05:55.852 --> 00:05:58.452
First Nations Development Institute,

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:01.364
to fund their
Native Youth and Culture Fund.

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:02.892
I'm sure some of you know that,

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:07.332
because of COVID-19, there's been a significant impact

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:12.165
on Native communities, and right now, only about 50%,

00:06:14.452 --> 00:06:17.448
I'm sorry, 15% of applicants

00:06:17.448 --> 00:06:20.620
to the Native Youth and Culture Fund receive support.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.391
And if we reach our goal of $50,000,

00:06:24.391 --> 00:06:27.010
Critical Role Foundation will be able to fund

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.740
two nonprofits located at Zuni Pueblo

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.901
and Cochiti Pueblo for an entire year.

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:34.734
MARISHA: Woo!

00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:37.170
ASHLEY: This fund supports grassroots projects

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.927
that strengthen and renew cultural and spiritual practices,

00:06:40.927 --> 00:06:44.589
beliefs and values, and helps preserve traditional

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:47.859
Native culture to the young people in these tribes.

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:49.884
So I'm very excited.

00:06:49.884 --> 00:06:52.970
To donate and to learn more about CRF

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.959

MARISHA: So exciting.

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:03.567
MATT: Thank you so much, Ashley.

00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:05.434
TRAVIS: A long time. A long time coming.

00:07:05.434 --> 00:07:06.739
MATT: A long time.
ASHLEY: Long time coming.

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:09.257
MATT: I know, like, two plus years in the making,

00:07:09.257 --> 00:07:11.945
working on this thing.
ASHLEY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:13.203
MATT: But yeah, thank you so much, Ashley,

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:15.373
thank all of you for all the generosity and support

00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:16.206
that you've shown through the years,

00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:19.765
that have helped us even be further inspired

00:07:19.765 --> 00:07:22.382
to take this next step in doing good in the world,

00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:23.565
together with you.

00:07:23.565 --> 00:07:26.783
So yeah, go check out that stuff.

00:07:26.783 --> 00:07:28.294
And I think...

00:07:28.294 --> 00:07:31.833
I think we're ready to jump into tonight's episode of...

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.141
TRAVIS: Gonna be in the closet!

00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.058
MATT: ...Critical Role!

00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:36.724
Hey everybody!

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:39.594
Matthew Mercer and Omar here.

00:07:39.594 --> 00:07:40.614
Wanted to let you know that,

00:07:40.614 --> 00:07:42.487
there you go buddy.

00:07:43.424 --> 00:07:44.574
Let you know that we will not be

00:07:44.574 --> 00:07:47.094
having an episode next week on October first.

00:07:47.094 --> 00:07:49.104
We had some unexpected adulting to do.

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.684
However, do not worry.

00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:53.494
Everyone is healthy, happy, and safe,

00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:57.230
but for all programming updates please do check out

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.724

00:09:46.613 --> 00:09:48.135
MATT: Welcome back.

00:09:48.135 --> 00:09:51.295
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:09:51.295 --> 00:09:54.135
after heading their way towards the capital of Rexxentrum

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:59.135
to meet up with Lady Vess DeRogna of the Cerberus Assembly,

00:09:59.378 --> 00:10:02.669
you discovered that there was interest to the north,

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.291
the region known as Eiselcross,

00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:07.159
within the perspective of Vess,

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:09.928
and she wished to hire you as both bodyguards

00:10:09.928 --> 00:10:13.759
and co-delvers within these apparently lost ruins

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:17.309
of an ancient pre-Calamity mage city known as Aeor,

00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:20.487
to the Frozen Wastes in that way.

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:23.119
You agreed to this and upon exiting her tower,

00:10:23.119 --> 00:10:24.650
it seemed that another member of the Assembly

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.147
was aware of your presence, as a letter was sent to Bren,

00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:29.446
inviting him and his friends to dinner

00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:31.912
at the abode...

00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:33.978
of Trent Ikithon.

00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:36.406
So you went, gathered some supplies,

00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:38.926
dressed to the nines and showed up to his tower,

00:10:38.926 --> 00:10:41.885
where you had a very tense dinner

00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:45.437
with Trent and the two childhood trainees

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:50.356
alongside Caleb as he grew up, Eadwulf and Astrid.

00:10:50.356 --> 00:10:53.669
This tension-laden dinner, while the food was delicious,

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:56.352
led to many conversations, some...

00:10:57.635 --> 00:11:00.010
darker reveals,

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.996
and some harsh truth from a Caduceus (laughs) to cap it off.

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:06.602
and some harsh truth from a Caduceus (laughs) to cap it off.

00:11:06.602 --> 00:11:08.031
LAURA: So good.

00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:10.490
MATT: But upon exiting, drinks were had,

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.042
escaping to a nearby inn, and you were all brought

00:11:14.042 --> 00:11:17.721
to your chambers, specifically going into one chamber

00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:20.935
that was rented by Caleb, who was assuring that there was

00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:22.831
a place to stay that would be comfortable.

00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:27.348
After paying to have a piece of furniture,

00:11:27.348 --> 00:11:30.150
much like a closet of some kind,

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.102
brought to the room, you prepared a spell

00:11:33.102 --> 00:11:35.641
and, briskly, you watched as the space

00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:38.182
within this cupboard-like closet

00:11:38.182 --> 00:11:41.932
began to shimmy and then reveal the interior.

00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:45.942
As you all step through, invited by Caleb

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:49.321
into this space, tell them what they see.

00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:52.460
LIAM: (excitedly) Yeah, well, you know,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.488
we're all very familiar with the limitations

00:11:55.488 --> 00:11:59.011
of our world, but we've been to places

00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:03.689
where those limitations become more malleable.

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:07.280
And I have been working on something for all of you.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.197
So please,

00:12:09.622 --> 00:12:11.342
come in, welcome home.

00:12:11.342 --> 00:12:15.123
As we walk in, you look up and see

00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:19.831
that we are standing at the bottom of a tall,

00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:24.636
almost cylindrical, towering room.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.144
And all the walls, all nine of them

00:12:30.144 --> 00:12:33.977
are vast stained glass windows

00:12:33.977 --> 00:12:35.860
with ornate designs.

00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:41.112
These are the nine schools of magic.

00:12:42.622 --> 00:12:45.530
There, that's dunamancy.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.680
You can see the dodecahedron at the center of that design.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.670
That one there, with Frumpkin in his various forms,

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.017
that is conjuration.

00:12:56.017 --> 00:12:59.217
This one up here, with the scales,

00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:02.350
that is transmutation.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.530
And so on and so forth.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.646
I walk us forward about 10 or 15 feet

00:13:07.646 --> 00:13:11.792
to a winding brass staircase that takes us up

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:14.835
onto a tower, about 10 feet in the air,

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:17.216
with a brass railing around it.

00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:18.908
And...

00:13:18.908 --> 00:13:22.458
we are now standing at the same height

00:13:22.458 --> 00:13:26.686
as the bottom of the windows, and looking up,

00:13:26.686 --> 00:13:29.667
you can see to the top of the tower,

00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:33.920
and 40 feet above us, there is another hole,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.720
also nine-sided, and you can see through that,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.630
beyond to more space, and way past that,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.334
you see another hole, nine-sided, and beyond that,

00:13:43.334 --> 00:13:46.302
it starts to get dimmer, but you can still see

00:13:46.302 --> 00:13:48.632
another hole and another hole.
(laughter)

00:13:48.632 --> 00:13:50.877
There are nine floors.

00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:52.002
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:13:53.315 --> 00:13:54.206
LIAM: Follow me, please.

00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:56.963
And Caleb steps forward into the center

00:13:56.963 --> 00:13:59.546
of this platform and begins to--

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:02.089
Just think "up."

00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:06.260
Just begins to slowly rise up
through the center of the room.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.627
TRAVIS: He's levitating?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:14:07.627 --> 00:14:08.963
TRAVIS: (laughs) (clapping)

00:14:08.963 --> 00:14:11.585
LIAM: Come on, come on, don't be shy.
There's much to see.

00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:13.261
TRAVIS: It's like Hogwarts with the broomsticks.

00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:14.486
LAURA: I think I can.

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.234
ASHLEY: I think I can, I think I can.

00:14:16.234 --> 00:14:17.429
SAM: Can we all do that?

00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:18.262
TALIESIN: This is weird.

00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:23.111
LIAM: You just think it and it is so, at least in here.

00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:27.344
LAURA: Like, think anything or just
the directions that we can move?

00:14:27.344 --> 00:14:30.719
LIAM: Generally, up or down are the
only ones that work, but try anything.

00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:33.072
TRAVIS: I'll try and go up and spin as I'm going.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.619
ASHLEY: Any happy, little thought?

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:36.859
MATT: You watch, as you slowly begin to corkscrew upward.

00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:40.009
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's happening!
It's happening, it's fuckin' happening!

00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:44.079
LAURA: I'm going to act like I'm swimming,
like in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:46.743
TALIESIN: I'm going to start trying to do a tuck and roll.

00:14:46.743 --> 00:14:49.439
MATT: Just don't bump into the ceiling,
it will have to be washed.

00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:51.058
LIAM: You're moving at about the same rate

00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:54.207
you are familiar with when Feather Fall is cast on you.

00:14:54.207 --> 00:14:55.423
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:59.848
LIAM: As you pass by all of these windows

00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:03.463
and reach this hole, you see just the barest

00:15:03.463 --> 00:15:05.735
bit of brass inside the lining of that hole,

00:15:05.735 --> 00:15:07.921
but pass through it.

00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:11.873
As the last of you come in, it's Caduceus,

00:15:11.873 --> 00:15:16.873
I say, "<i>zu</i>" and a brass metal iris

00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:20.140
closes around where we came from, shutting it,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.809
but we continue to float up a little bit.

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:23.980
And now we're in another large chamber,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.867
not as tall as the first, but the same nine sides.

00:15:26.867 --> 00:15:28.267
And you see...

00:15:29.743 --> 00:15:33.771
well, there are globules everywhere, lighting up the room.

00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:36.641
Floating maybe five feet off the floor,

00:15:36.641 --> 00:15:39.049
all around the chamber.

00:15:39.049 --> 00:15:41.372
This is a very large room, it's empty.

00:15:41.372 --> 00:15:43.868
There is another ring of globules at the top.

00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:46.844
You see on every wall, all nine sides,

00:15:46.844 --> 00:15:50.703
there are beautiful, wooden,

00:15:50.703 --> 00:15:52.244
Zemnian design,

00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:54.372
sliding doors, all closed.

00:15:55.218 --> 00:15:59.076
And, in each of the corners, at the floor level,

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:04.076
are little wooden holes or portcullises.

00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:08.203
Above those sliding doors are little,

00:16:08.203 --> 00:16:11.975
almost like a wooden aqueduct built into the walls.

00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:15.946
Little tracks, moving around the room.

00:16:15.946 --> 00:16:17.784
Some diagonal, some straight.

00:16:17.784 --> 00:16:18.701
SAM: With water?

00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:22.022
LIAM: No, no, no, just <i>like</i> an aqueduct.

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:22.855
We can--

00:16:22.855 --> 00:16:24.476
LAURA: Can we roll, like, marbles down them?

00:16:24.476 --> 00:16:26.476
What is this for, Caleb?

00:16:27.338 --> 00:16:30.090
LIAM: We'll get to that, but you can roll marbles

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.780
down them, if you can reach them.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.348
MARISHA: I pull out a ball bearing.
LAURA: I think "up"!

00:16:33.348 --> 00:16:34.338
TRAVIS: Goddamn it.

00:16:34.338 --> 00:16:36.227
MARISHA: And I will myself over.

00:16:36.227 --> 00:16:38.303
LAURA: Up, up, up!
LIAM: You cannot--

00:16:38.303 --> 00:16:39.136
LAURA: Up!

00:16:40.212 --> 00:16:41.272
MARISHA: Ball bearing.

00:16:41.272 --> 00:16:42.500
(laughter)

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.340
LIAM: The room is much wider than the hole

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.170
that we floated out of, so everyone is generally floating

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.742
in an undefined, invisible column

00:16:51.742 --> 00:16:54.303
in the center of this much wider space.

00:16:54.303 --> 00:16:55.551
This is a large hole.

00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:57.233
TALIESIN: Are you going to try and toss a ball bearing?

00:16:57.233 --> 00:16:58.303
Here, Bless.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.091
TRAVIS: You're going to break the tower.

00:17:01.091 --> 00:17:02.560
MARISHA: (grunting)

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.445
LAURA: (mimicking crashing)

00:17:04.445 --> 00:17:06.902
MARISHA: I'm trying to toss a ball bearing in the aqueduct.

00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:08.429
Definitely made for blood.

00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:11.695
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a d20 roll.
TALIESIN: With a d4.

00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:12.753
LAURA: Caleb!
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>?

00:17:12.753 --> 00:17:16.872
MATT: Add a d4 and add your dexterity modifier.
LAURA: You made a happy fun ball.

00:17:16.872 --> 00:17:19.344
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh boy.
LIAM: It's a different shape, but.

00:17:19.344 --> 00:17:20.944
MARISHA: 15.

00:17:20.944 --> 00:17:21.777
MATT: 15?

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.525
It makes it, roughly.

00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:26.804
LIAM: Okay, so what would happen is that ball bearing

00:17:26.804 --> 00:17:30.322
would hit the aqueduct and we'd just hear that little,

00:17:30.322 --> 00:17:32.205
(creaking)

00:17:32.205 --> 00:17:35.187
slides down and goes down around,

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.538
hitting corners as it goes, maybe to three corners,

00:17:37.538 --> 00:17:39.099
and disappears into a hole.

00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:40.629
MARISHA: Oh.

00:17:40.629 --> 00:17:42.709
LIAM: And then it comes out a hole on the floor level

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:45.349
on the other side, and rolls off into the center

00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:47.099
of the room, hitting the brass,

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.909
closed brass iris at the center of this floor.

00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:53.229
And we float up through, and we are now

00:17:53.229 --> 00:17:57.818
in a massive three-story library.

00:17:57.818 --> 00:17:58.943
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasp)

00:17:58.943 --> 00:17:59.812
LIAM: This is the salon.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:03.744
This is where we will spend a lot of time together.

00:18:03.744 --> 00:18:07.133
It's three levels of libraries, with steps,

00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:09.723
wooden, spiraling steps, going up in different places.

00:18:09.723 --> 00:18:11.493
It is not symmetrical.

00:18:11.493 --> 00:18:14.696
There are different areas on the floor level in here,

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:16.547
not in the center, because there is a hole.

00:18:16.547 --> 00:18:18.857
You would not put furniture in a hole.

00:18:18.857 --> 00:18:22.360
There are chaise lounges and fainting couches

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.480
and comfy chairs and a beautiful fireplace,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.720
with a fire crackling in it already.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.970
Above the fireplace is a stained glass window,

00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:36.413
the length of the fireplace, and the glass

00:18:36.413 --> 00:18:40.403
is in a pattern and color and design that

00:18:40.403 --> 00:18:43.679
immediately brings to mind Mollymauk's coat.

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:45.871
MARISHA: Oh!
LAURA: Wow.

00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:49.003
LIAM: All around the room, you see, on different levels,

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:53.024
other little reading nooks and cozy corners.

00:18:53.024 --> 00:18:56.653
On the second floor, on one side, you see maps

00:18:56.653 --> 00:18:59.024
hanging from the wall and a large wooden table

00:18:59.024 --> 00:19:02.691
in the shape of the continent of Wildemount.

00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:07.763
There are globules floating around.

00:19:07.763 --> 00:19:10.901
Hidden amongst the lining of the library shelves

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:12.731
are more of these wooden tracks,

00:19:12.731 --> 00:19:15.881
there are holes on the bottom level, the second level,

00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:17.815
the third level.
LAURA: What's it for, Caleb?

00:19:17.815 --> 00:19:19.120
What's it for?

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.419
MARISHA: Wait--
TRAVIS: Urine, urine.

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.095
LAURA: Also, do the books actually have anything in them?

00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:24.627
Are they blank books, are they real books?

00:19:24.627 --> 00:19:25.776
LIAM: They are real books.

00:19:25.776 --> 00:19:27.894
They're all books that I have read.

00:19:27.894 --> 00:19:29.779
LAURA: Wow, you've read a lot of books.

00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:33.325
TRAVIS: In your mind?
Books you've read in your keen mind?

00:19:33.325 --> 00:19:35.115
Like, they're just there?

00:19:35.115 --> 00:19:36.776
LIAM: There may be some duplicates, it's a lot of books.

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:39.184
TRAVIS: Oh fuck!
MATT: (laughs)

00:19:39.184 --> 00:19:40.675
LIAM: But not many.

00:19:40.675 --> 00:19:42.723
LAURA: Think of all the dicks I can draw.

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.613
TALIESIN: (laughs)

00:19:45.613 --> 00:19:48.354
TRAVIS: Caleb, this is stunning.

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:51.915
How long have you been working on this?

00:19:51.915 --> 00:19:53.267
LIAM: Who, me or Liam?

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:55.219
TRAVIS: Oh!
(laughter)

00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:56.918
TALIESIN: Both, actually.
TRAVIS: Both, yeah.

00:19:56.918 --> 00:19:58.347
LIAM: Liam, for over a year.

00:19:58.347 --> 00:19:59.613
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:20:03.147 --> 00:20:05.030
LIAM: Well, since...

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.032
since I was not able to stop the three of you

00:20:08.032 --> 00:20:12.432
from being taken from us, I have been working it out.

00:20:12.432 --> 00:20:15.152
One step at a time, you know.

00:20:15.152 --> 00:20:17.443
The dome is-- I love the dome.

00:20:17.443 --> 00:20:19.589
We will still use the dome; I cannot always do this.

00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:24.172
This takes a lot of time and attention and focus,

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.067
but I wanted to do better.

00:20:28.067 --> 00:20:31.034
SAM: Is it always here? I mean, with you?

00:20:31.034 --> 00:20:32.988
Like, does it disappear when we leave?

00:20:32.988 --> 00:20:34.770
LAURA: Yeah, is it like your little amber?

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.718
TALIESIN: Do we have to steal this wardrobe?

00:20:36.718 --> 00:20:37.696
TRAVIS: Yeah, do we need a closet?

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.403
LIAM: No.

00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:42.035
The doorway to this, right now,

00:20:42.035 --> 00:20:46.618
we are about one centimeter off of our current reality.

00:20:47.484 --> 00:20:49.374
We're very...

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.747
it's funny, we're actually very small right now.

00:20:51.747 --> 00:20:54.005
It doesn't feel that way, but we are.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.667
The doorway, as soon as I closed it behind us,

00:20:57.667 --> 00:21:01.917
is invisible to the proprietors of the inn.

00:21:01.917 --> 00:21:04.238
If we are ever somewhere on the side of a mountain

00:21:04.238 --> 00:21:06.686
or at the beach and I open the doorway there,

00:21:06.686 --> 00:21:09.296
it will remain there, usable only by us,

00:21:09.296 --> 00:21:12.895
and if I close the door, no one else will see it.

00:21:12.895 --> 00:21:17.642
So we have a tiny little place to hide.

00:21:17.642 --> 00:21:21.194
TRAVIS: Usable only by us, no one
could stumble upon it, into it?

00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:23.465
LIAM: Well.
TRAVIS: By accident.

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:25.437
LIAM: It's hard to, it would be difficult.

00:21:25.437 --> 00:21:26.611
It's not impossible.

00:21:26.611 --> 00:21:29.142
ASHLEY: Can they be invited in?

00:21:29.142 --> 00:21:31.478
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah, they could be invited in.

00:21:31.478 --> 00:21:35.072
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
LAURA: So we have bedrooms?

00:21:35.072 --> 00:21:36.222
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, you do have bedrooms.

00:21:36.222 --> 00:21:38.388
SAM: Oh, what floor is that on?
TRAVIS: Was that on the second floor,

00:21:38.388 --> 00:21:39.896
with the doors?

00:21:39.896 --> 00:21:42.387
SAM: We're already on the third floor.
LIAM: Fifth floor.

00:21:42.387 --> 00:21:43.835
SAM: Oh, yeah.

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:45.696
LIAM: We can come back here later, it's very late,

00:21:45.696 --> 00:21:49.296
but this has been bouncing around the
inside of my skull for such a long time.

00:21:49.296 --> 00:21:50.557
Come, come on.
SAM: Okay.

00:21:50.557 --> 00:21:51.819
LIAM: (swooshing)

00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:53.720
TRAVIS: Up!
(laughter)

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.950
LIAM: Floating up through--

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.177
MATT: I love the idea of Fjord, every time he goes,

00:21:58.177 --> 00:22:00.448
just says it, "Up?" Like bat!

00:22:00.448 --> 00:22:02.807
TRAVIS: I say "Eldritch Blast," let's go.

00:22:02.807 --> 00:22:04.138
All right?
(laughter)

00:22:04.138 --> 00:22:05.800
MATT: I love it.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.880
ASHLEY: Eldritch Blast.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.713
TRAVIS: Bat!

00:22:07.713 --> 00:22:09.593
MATT: (wings flapping)

00:22:09.593 --> 00:22:10.704
MARISHA: So good.

00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:11.786
Human form.

00:22:11.786 --> 00:22:12.985
TRAVIS: I love it so much.

00:22:12.985 --> 00:22:17.751
LIAM: All right, so as the group levitates

00:22:17.751 --> 00:22:19.975
up out of the salon

00:22:19.975 --> 00:22:24.415
into what is the fifth floor, the lower bed chambers,

00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:27.582
we're in a very small nine-sided room.

00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:32.345
This says N-E-I-N everywhere, it says Nein.

00:22:32.345 --> 00:22:33.178
For what it's worth.

00:22:33.178 --> 00:22:34.594
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:34.594 --> 00:22:38.163
LIAM: We're in a small wooden chamber, nine sides,

00:22:38.163 --> 00:22:43.046
and split evenly amongst those nine sides,

00:22:43.046 --> 00:22:45.122
there are three doors.

00:22:45.122 --> 00:22:48.067
Don't pay this one any mind, this is a guest bedroom.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:49.936
LAURA: Insight check.

00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:52.996
(laughter)

00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:54.679
MATT: Go for it.
LIAM: Roll some dice.

00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:56.550
TRAVIS: I think it's, "Do I believe him?"

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.156
Is the question.
LAURA: Do I believe him?

00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:01.407
20.
SAM: (gasps)

00:23:01.407 --> 00:23:03.893
LIAM: (sighs) You don't know.

00:23:03.893 --> 00:23:06.211
He opens the door and inside, you see

00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:10.245
a very nondescript fireplace, cozy.

00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:15.823
Zemnian, wooden furniture and architecture.

00:23:15.823 --> 00:23:20.415
Again, there is a small side table next to the fireplace,

00:23:20.415 --> 00:23:23.165
with a stack of five books on it.

00:23:24.335 --> 00:23:28.310
Several cozy chairs, some water in a pitcher.

00:23:30.007 --> 00:23:32.682
And then, a door, leading into another section.

00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:35.325
You could inspect the entire guest chambers if you wish.

00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:37.300
LAURA: No, that's okay, I'll just inspect my room.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.395
LIAM: Good, that's where the bodies are.

00:23:38.395 --> 00:23:39.315
(door closing)

00:23:40.757 --> 00:23:42.943
Caduceus, this one with the scarab beetle

00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:47.138
on the door is your room, please come in.

00:23:47.138 --> 00:23:48.506
TALIESIN: It's a very tall door.

00:23:48.506 --> 00:23:49.735
(clearing throat)
(laughter)

00:23:49.735 --> 00:23:51.964
LIAM: It's not that tall a door.
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:23:51.964 --> 00:23:54.975
LIAM: But the furniture is quite large in the next room.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:58.141
It is more accommodating to your size than you're used to,

00:23:58.141 --> 00:24:00.637
traveling with us, for the most part.

00:24:00.637 --> 00:24:04.146
In this room is another fireplace,

00:24:04.146 --> 00:24:06.893
with a fire burning, and a stained glass window.

00:24:06.893 --> 00:24:10.535
This one, depicting the story of Clay, Stone, and Dust.

00:24:10.535 --> 00:24:12.855
On the left, beasts of the wild,

00:24:12.855 --> 00:24:14.757
within a cavern of red and gold.

00:24:14.757 --> 00:24:16.058
At the center is a pool of water,

00:24:16.058 --> 00:24:18.007
surrounded by caverns of crystal

00:24:18.007 --> 00:24:21.046
and plants and flowers growing about it, all in glass.

00:24:21.046 --> 00:24:23.878
At the right, a pool of fiery magma

00:24:23.878 --> 00:24:25.846
within a cavern of obsidian.

00:24:25.846 --> 00:24:27.294
TRAVIS: Yeah, but give us the details.

00:24:27.294 --> 00:24:30.619
(laughter)

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:34.224
LIAM: Furniture is simple, wooden, firbolg-sized.

00:24:34.224 --> 00:24:38.066
It is reminiscent, the furniture
in this room, of your graveyard home,

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:40.534
from the brief glimpse we had inside.

00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:43.117
There is a tea station in the corner,

00:24:43.117 --> 00:24:46.997
and that pot is endless boiling water.

00:24:46.997 --> 00:24:48.705
TRAVIS: Fuck.
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

00:24:48.705 --> 00:24:52.571
I want to go back and re-describe my
outfit that I was wearing last game.

00:24:52.571 --> 00:24:54.789
(laughter)

00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:59.948
LIAM: I push open an inner door and we find another room.

00:24:59.948 --> 00:25:02.369
This room doesn't seem like a room,

00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:04.289
it is filled with an eclectic assortment

00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:07.700
of fungi, crystal formations, ferns,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.359
and other plants.
LAURA: So many fun guys in here!

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:11.571
LIAM: There is--
MARISHA: It's a frat party!

00:25:11.571 --> 00:25:14.521
LIAM: A potted plant that is home to a small colony

00:25:14.521 --> 00:25:18.188
of bioluminescent beetles that
are crawling around on it now.

00:25:18.188 --> 00:25:19.799
LAURA: What?!
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:24.492
LIAM: I push through and within is a very large

00:25:24.492 --> 00:25:27.964
four-post bed that is firbolg-sized.

00:25:27.964 --> 00:25:30.793
There is a brass bathtub in here,

00:25:30.793 --> 00:25:34.531
and you can see steam rising off of hot water in it.

00:25:34.531 --> 00:25:35.852
TALIESIN: Oh, oh no.

00:25:35.852 --> 00:25:37.433
MARISHA: Can I have Caduceus' room?

00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:39.345
TALIESIN: Nope.
(laughter)

00:25:39.345 --> 00:25:41.228
LIAM: Just you wait.
MARISHA: All right.

00:25:41.228 --> 00:25:42.997
LIAM: Next, next, come, come.

00:25:44.634 --> 00:25:46.881
Happy birthday, everyone.

00:25:48.923 --> 00:25:52.142
Caleb leads everybody back into the central chamber.

00:25:52.142 --> 00:25:53.142
Oh jeez, don't fall.

00:25:53.142 --> 00:25:55.680
<i>Zu</i>, and the iris goes (swooshing) and shuts.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.129
TRAVIS: <i>Zu</i>.
LAURA: (mimics sneezing)

00:25:57.129 --> 00:26:00.346
SAM: Is this like Star Wars Land, where
some of the attractions aren't open yet?

00:26:00.346 --> 00:26:04.452
(laughter)

00:26:04.452 --> 00:26:05.732
LIAM: Come back in 2021.

00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:07.940
(laughter)

00:26:09.393 --> 00:26:13.624
There is lilacs on a door here and that is yours, Yasha.

00:26:13.624 --> 00:26:15.107
Please, come in.

00:26:16.806 --> 00:26:18.583
This is your room.

00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:20.196
Also, a fireplace.

00:26:20.196 --> 00:26:22.105
Notice the theme.

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:23.985
The stained glass above the fireplace

00:26:23.985 --> 00:26:25.803
depicts the symbol of the Storm Lord

00:26:25.803 --> 00:26:28.435
against a clouded background with gray

00:26:28.435 --> 00:26:31.335
and lavender flowers along the bottom edge,

00:26:31.335 --> 00:26:34.767
hints of lightning, of course, always hidden in the clouds.

00:26:34.767 --> 00:26:37.776
This room is exploding with flowers.

00:26:37.776 --> 00:26:40.095
There are pressed flowers hanging on the walls,

00:26:40.095 --> 00:26:43.905
there are vases of flowers, there are potted plants.

00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:46.572
Everywhere, you cannot see the walls in here,

00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:50.895
you can only see a single door, which leads in here.

00:26:50.895 --> 00:26:53.313
This room is far emptier.

00:26:53.313 --> 00:26:56.783
There is a simple straw mat upon the floor,

00:26:56.783 --> 00:26:59.004
and the wall wrapping all around it,

00:26:59.004 --> 00:27:01.703
is a very familiar sight to you and you,

00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:05.886
it is the mural that you painted for Yasha,

00:27:06.932 --> 00:27:08.999
but as we all sort of crowd in at the doorway

00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:13.953
and look at it, the flowers shift in the breeze.

00:27:13.953 --> 00:27:14.786
SAM: Ooh!

00:27:14.786 --> 00:27:17.660
LIAM: Just a little bit, just ever so slightly breathe.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.769
ASHLEY: Come on. Come on.

00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:21.931
LIAM: Here's your bedroom over here,

00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:24.763
more pressed flowers surrounding the room.

00:27:24.763 --> 00:27:27.854
The bedding is reminiscent of Xhorhasian design.

00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:30.353
There is, in addition to the same brass tub

00:27:30.353 --> 00:27:32.982
of steaming water and the four-post bed,

00:27:32.982 --> 00:27:37.233
there is a terrarium full of insects,

00:27:37.233 --> 00:27:39.683
which are either for viewing or possibly snacks,

00:27:39.683 --> 00:27:42.008
depending on what you're in the mood for.

00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:43.498
ASHLEY: I'm just going to, real quick-- can I?

00:27:43.498 --> 00:27:46.891
LIAM: They're yours for the taking.

00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:47.753
ASHLEY: Oh!

00:27:47.753 --> 00:27:48.806
(laughter)

00:27:48.806 --> 00:27:52.097
Sweet and a little spicy, a little,

00:27:52.097 --> 00:27:55.495
you know, peppery kick at the end.

00:27:55.495 --> 00:27:56.622
SAM: It's a dung beetle.

00:27:56.622 --> 00:27:59.033
(laughter)

00:27:59.033 --> 00:28:00.593
TRAVIS: Oh, a little cream-filled one.

00:28:00.593 --> 00:28:02.283
(laughter)

00:28:02.283 --> 00:28:04.287
LIAM: Come, come, come with me.

00:28:04.287 --> 00:28:07.047
I lead us all back out into the center

00:28:07.047 --> 00:28:10.561
of the lower bed chambers, and I just leave you all,

00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:14.255
I just start hovering up into the next floor.

00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:17.335
Up here, are three doorways.

00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:20.964
On them is a small gate, an anchor

00:28:20.964 --> 00:28:24.524
and the symbol of the Cobalt Soul.

00:28:24.524 --> 00:28:25.755
TRAVIS: (grunts in joy)

00:28:25.755 --> 00:28:27.094
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:28:27.094 --> 00:28:31.115
LIAM: I push open the doorway to Fjord's bedroom.

00:28:31.115 --> 00:28:32.675
The stained glass above the fireplace

00:28:32.675 --> 00:28:35.323
warmly depicts a sailing vessel at sea.

00:28:35.323 --> 00:28:36.854
The walls of all three rooms are designed

00:28:36.854 --> 00:28:38.563
to look like the insides of a ship.

00:28:38.563 --> 00:28:41.411
There are porthole windows spaced out

00:28:41.411 --> 00:28:43.081
all throughout the quarters, but the glass

00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:46.771
is thick and opaque, you can't really see through them.

00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:49.361
Oh, I should mention, down below,

00:28:49.361 --> 00:28:52.481
maybe another time, we're moving too quickly.

00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:54.502
TRAVIS: We don't have to be, really.

00:28:54.502 --> 00:28:56.185
TALIESIN: I'll take the whole game for this.

00:28:56.185 --> 00:28:57.485
I'm really into it.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:28:57.485 --> 00:29:00.323
LIAM: All of these rooms, these sitting rooms

00:29:00.323 --> 00:29:02.061
that you've seen in all these rooms,

00:29:02.061 --> 00:29:04.541
have the same little rounded table

00:29:04.541 --> 00:29:07.621
with a stack of five books on them.

00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:09.081
They are all the same five books.

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:12.333
But Fjord, if you're paying attention,

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:15.603
if you see your side table with the five books,

00:29:15.603 --> 00:29:18.647
you see, peeking out from under it,

00:29:18.647 --> 00:29:23.647
the same design from the altar top of Dashilla's

00:29:24.022 --> 00:29:25.572
briny lair.

00:29:26.813 --> 00:29:28.396
Just as a reminder.

00:29:29.232 --> 00:29:30.832
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:32.341
Thank you for that.

00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:35.515
LIAM: Next, right, pushing open the inner doorway--

00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:36.916
MATT: Dietetics?

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:39.541
(laughter)

00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:41.760
LIAM: These rooms all-- we enter into a sitting room,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.050
and then there's a door to the right,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:48.050
which leads into a unique room and then another door past.

00:29:48.491 --> 00:29:51.507
The quarters sort of curve around

00:29:51.507 --> 00:29:54.349
this nine-sided donut until it hits an end.

00:29:54.349 --> 00:29:58.582
Your center room is very sparse.

00:29:58.582 --> 00:30:01.411
It is a meditation room for you.

00:30:01.411 --> 00:30:03.472
There is a mat laid out here as well.

00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:05.129
On the wall there is hanging

00:30:05.129 --> 00:30:06.899
an old, yellowed map of the waters

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:10.597
and islands of the Menagerie Coast.

00:30:10.597 --> 00:30:11.968
Standing before the opposite wall

00:30:11.968 --> 00:30:14.549
is a stone statue of the Wild Mother,

00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:19.549
who is draped with curling ivy and vine around her, growing.

00:30:19.957 --> 00:30:22.664
Through here is your bedroom.

00:30:22.664 --> 00:30:25.624
There is a similar four-post bed.

00:30:25.624 --> 00:30:29.481
The steaming tub of brass, but there is also

00:30:29.481 --> 00:30:33.125
a hammock bolted into the ceiling here,

00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:35.016
like you're accustomed to sleeping in,

00:30:35.016 --> 00:30:36.922
in your sailing days.
TRAVIS: The ship, yes.

00:30:36.922 --> 00:30:39.584
SAM: Look, Fjord, there's a stack of two-pound weights

00:30:39.584 --> 00:30:41.481
for you to do your exercises with.

00:30:41.481 --> 00:30:43.588
(laughter)

00:30:43.588 --> 00:30:44.716
TRAVIS: Thankfully.

00:30:44.716 --> 00:30:49.108
(laughter)

00:30:53.727 --> 00:30:56.200
LIAM: You can get jacked later, Captain.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.298
Beauregard, let me show you your room.

00:30:58.298 --> 00:31:00.020
MATT: You press the button on the side to...

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.344
TRAVIS: (machine buzzing)

00:31:02.344 --> 00:31:05.275
LIAM: I push into the doorway with the symbol

00:31:05.275 --> 00:31:09.414
of the Cobalt Soul on it, and we see another fireplace

00:31:09.414 --> 00:31:12.689
and the stained glass above it is a picture of

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.905
the Mighty Nein, standing with their backs to the viewer,

00:31:17.905 --> 00:31:22.227
looking off into the hills and fields of the Empire.

00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:28.586
The same five books on a side table,

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:30.336
comfortable furniture.

00:31:31.425 --> 00:31:34.758
I push into the middle room and you see,

00:31:35.731 --> 00:31:39.601
mostly empty, but there is sashes in Cobalt blue,

00:31:39.601 --> 00:31:42.942
draped around the room, there are three bo staffs,

00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:46.873
hanging decoratively on one wall.

00:31:46.873 --> 00:31:51.873
There is a polished wooden fighting post in one corner,

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:55.742
with blue bands wrapped around it.

00:31:55.742 --> 00:31:57.747
There is a writing desk and quills

00:31:57.747 --> 00:32:00.639
and a stack of blank paper for you.

00:32:00.639 --> 00:32:02.081
It's not--
MARISHA: Perfect.

00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:04.891
LIAM: The quality is just okay.

00:32:04.891 --> 00:32:06.511
MARISHA: It's just--
LIAM: But it's serviceable.

00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:09.379
MARISHA: I've been through so many
notebooks, it's appreciated.

00:32:09.379 --> 00:32:10.836
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:32:10.836 --> 00:32:12.857
LIAM: Here is your bedroom.

00:32:12.857 --> 00:32:17.607
Four-post bed, all done in blue, of course, same bathtub.

00:32:18.486 --> 00:32:19.653
Do me a favor.

00:32:20.503 --> 00:32:22.170
Lie down on the bed.

00:32:23.635 --> 00:32:26.498
We're all at the doorway, go lie on the bed.

00:32:26.498 --> 00:32:27.655
TRAVIS: Go lie on the bed!

00:32:27.655 --> 00:32:28.988
Be a good sport.

00:32:31.344 --> 00:32:35.603
LIAM: Okay, there is a blue, like, sash or rope

00:32:35.603 --> 00:32:39.790
hanging just above your shoulder there, pull it down.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.265
LAURA: Pull the rope!

00:32:41.265 --> 00:32:43.682
LIAM: It actually slides forward.

00:32:44.575 --> 00:32:47.685
You are immediately looking at yourself in a mirror,

00:32:47.685 --> 00:32:50.385
built into the roof of the four-post bed.

00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:52.001
SAM: Hot.

00:32:52.001 --> 00:32:53.185
Super hot.

00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:55.859
(laughter)

00:32:55.859 --> 00:32:58.455
TRAVIS: What?!
SAM: Super hot.

00:32:58.455 --> 00:32:59.727
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:02.474
Whoa!
LAURA: That is amazing.

00:33:02.474 --> 00:33:04.837
TRAVIS: Whoa! (laughs)

00:33:04.837 --> 00:33:05.670
Look at her!

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.134
LIAM: We are friends, you and I.

00:33:07.134 --> 00:33:09.374
(laughter)

00:33:09.374 --> 00:33:12.283
ASHLEY: I go peek under the canopy.

00:33:12.283 --> 00:33:13.830
That's going to be useful.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.621
SAM: Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:16.454
TRAVIS: (alarm whoop)

00:33:16.454 --> 00:33:18.150
(laughter)

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.713
LIAM: Meet us outside in a minute.

00:33:19.713 --> 00:33:20.611
MARISHA: (sighing)

00:33:20.611 --> 00:33:22.198
LIAM: And I push everyone out.

00:33:22.198 --> 00:33:23.031
LAURA: (squealing)

00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:24.890
(laughter)

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.723
MARISHA: You're my best friend, Caleb.

00:33:26.723 --> 00:33:28.890
LIAM: (ascending tone) Ooop!

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.214
TRAVIS: Are we out and up a floor?
LIAM: Oh shoot!

00:33:31.214 --> 00:33:32.265
I was so excited.

00:33:32.265 --> 00:33:33.657
LIAM: (descending tone) Ooop.

00:33:33.657 --> 00:33:35.323
LAURA: What about the gate?
TRAVIS: Down!

00:33:35.323 --> 00:33:36.284
LIAM: That's you.

00:33:36.284 --> 00:33:37.117
LAURA: I'm the gate?

00:33:37.117 --> 00:33:39.752
LIAM: You are the gate, that is the arch.

00:33:39.752 --> 00:33:41.540
LAURA: Oh, it's an arch!

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.901
I thought it was, like, a gate-gate.

00:33:42.901 --> 00:33:46.043
LIAM: No, it's the symbol hanging on your chain.
LAURA: Awesome!

00:33:46.043 --> 00:33:49.139
LIAM: Okay, anyway, opening the door.

00:33:49.139 --> 00:33:54.107
The doorway, by the way, and the one that leads further in

00:33:54.107 --> 00:33:59.107
have little gemstones sort of built into the sides of it,

00:33:59.134 --> 00:34:03.009
subtly reminiscent of the Traveler's gate.

00:34:06.648 --> 00:34:08.176
It's too much, too much, too much.

00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:10.814
Okay, so here we are, we're inside.

00:34:10.814 --> 00:34:14.645
Fireplace crackling, the stained glass above your fire

00:34:14.645 --> 00:34:17.485
depicts the coastal cityscape of Nicodranas.

00:34:17.485 --> 00:34:20.896
The Chateau visible and a small, red figure on the balcony,

00:34:20.896 --> 00:34:22.907
arm outstretched towards the water.

00:34:22.907 --> 00:34:23.907
LAURA: Mama!

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.893
LIAM: The decor and furniture in this room is not Zemnian,

00:34:29.893 --> 00:34:34.011
it is recreating the decor and design of the Lavish Chateau.

00:34:34.011 --> 00:34:36.178
LAURA: (gasps)

00:34:37.648 --> 00:34:39.048
LIAM: Same five books.

00:34:39.048 --> 00:34:41.540
LAURA: What are the books? I start looking at the books!
TRAVIS: Ask the question!

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.377
LAURA: Of course I'm going to ask,
I'm looking at my own now!

00:34:44.377 --> 00:34:45.377
MARISHA: Tusk Love.
LAURA: What is this book, what is this book?

00:34:46.579 --> 00:34:48.726
LIAM: One of them is Tusk Love, that is correct.

00:34:48.726 --> 00:34:51.022
(laughter)

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.757
Oh dear, where'd they go? Where'd they go?
TRAVIS: What are my books this semester?

00:34:53.757 --> 00:34:55.917
MARISHA: What are all the ones that we've had?

00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:58.669
LAURA: The Daring Trials and Tribulations--

00:34:58.669 --> 00:34:59.675
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Tusk Love.

00:34:59.675 --> 00:35:01.633
You read The Courting of the Crick.

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:02.955
MARISHA: Oh yes!

00:35:02.955 --> 00:35:06.445
LIAM: You find something called <i>Der Katzenprinz.</i>

00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:07.947
It looks to be some sort of illustrated

00:35:07.947 --> 00:35:10.096
Zemnian children's story.

00:35:10.096 --> 00:35:13.535
Change and the Potentials of Transmutability.

00:35:13.535 --> 00:35:16.215
MARISHA: Everyone's interests.
LIAM: And something that says,

00:35:16.215 --> 00:35:20.080
<i>Die Waldhexe und andere Zemnische Volksmärchen.</i>

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.236
That's children's fairytales.

00:35:23.236 --> 00:35:27.012
TRAVIS: The vortex?
MARISHA: Oh, it's the vortex!

00:35:27.012 --> 00:35:28.145
Hell yes!

00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:32.271
LIAM: Okay, so--

00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:34.408
SAM: Zemnian fairytales, by the way, are dark.

00:35:34.408 --> 00:35:36.297
LAURA: They're dark.
LIAM: They're very dark.

00:35:36.297 --> 00:35:38.339
SAM: Kids get their thumbs chopped off and stuff.

00:35:38.339 --> 00:35:39.679
ASHLEY: Om nom nom nom nom.
TALIESIN: Bless you.

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:40.829
LIAM: Only the lucky ones.

00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:42.144
TRAVIS: Om nom nom nom nom!

00:35:42.144 --> 00:35:43.844
(laughter)

00:35:43.844 --> 00:35:45.032
TALIESIN: That's all I wanted, Sam, thank you.

00:35:45.032 --> 00:35:47.062
MATT: Yeah, the green, long-legged clipper man?

00:35:47.062 --> 00:35:48.939
(laughter)

00:35:48.939 --> 00:35:51.322
TALIESIN: Those shears.
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

00:35:51.322 --> 00:35:53.999
LIAM: Caleb pushes open the next doorway, and inside,

00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:57.068
everybody sees a very well-stocked art studio.

00:35:57.068 --> 00:35:58.295
There are--
LAURA: (gasps)

00:35:58.295 --> 00:36:02.584
LIAM: -- paints and chalks and ink and lots of paper,

00:36:02.584 --> 00:36:04.665
still subpar, but serviceable.

00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:06.982
There are painting easels and canvases

00:36:06.982 --> 00:36:08.345
that sit, waiting for creation.

00:36:08.345 --> 00:36:10.494
The walls in here are all blank.

00:36:10.494 --> 00:36:12.436
In fact, the room is pure white and ready

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:15.375
to be whatever you choose to make it.

00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:17.057
LAURA: I love it, Caleb, thank you.

00:36:17.057 --> 00:36:19.992
If I put the paintings in here,
they'll stay when we leave?

00:36:19.992 --> 00:36:22.267
LIAM: If you wish.
LAURA: Okay.

00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:25.322
There is also a small, lovely side table in this room,

00:36:25.322 --> 00:36:29.846
full of pastries and a bowl of blueberries in the corner.

00:36:29.846 --> 00:36:33.967
LAURA: I will never get hungry while I'm painting!

00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:36.959
LIAM: And then in here is your bedroom.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.460
As you walk in, you see almost a recreation

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.850
of the bedroom that you just showed to all of us

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.330
the night before, but it is more of an homage,

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.490
it is more of an updated version of your room.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.128
It has all the same elements,

00:36:53.128 --> 00:36:54.811
but this is...

00:36:55.928 --> 00:36:58.611
equal parts whimsy and elegance.

00:36:58.611 --> 00:37:02.189
There are all the same shelves of books here.

00:37:02.189 --> 00:37:04.810
The colors of the spines of the books

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.810
look exactly as you remember.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.640
The windows in this room match the windows in your old room,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.109
but since we are not in Nicodranas,

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:15.138
they are actually all stained glass, recreating those views

00:37:15.138 --> 00:37:17.248
that you saw from your room.
LAURA: Oh, wow.

00:37:17.248 --> 00:37:20.858
LIAM: There are a small selection of framed art pieces

00:37:20.858 --> 00:37:25.268
on the walls, mirroring a few of those bits

00:37:25.268 --> 00:37:29.888
of art on your wall, so there is one of a very early sketch

00:37:29.888 --> 00:37:32.157
that you did, framed in a wooden portrait,

00:37:32.157 --> 00:37:34.717
and then one of the most detailed is there.

00:37:34.717 --> 00:37:39.717
There is also a portrait of your mother on the wall.

00:37:39.854 --> 00:37:44.818
Three lanterns hang about the room, illuminating it.

00:37:44.818 --> 00:37:46.829
(singing)

00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:50.087
You too also have to look at--

00:37:50.087 --> 00:37:52.787
you see your canopy bed.

00:37:52.787 --> 00:37:54.309
And it is just as frilly, but again,

00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:57.809
it is a little more sumptuous and refined.

00:37:59.228 --> 00:38:01.657
But I want you to, just like Beauregard,

00:38:01.657 --> 00:38:04.624
it's not a mirror, lie down and look at the top.

00:38:04.624 --> 00:38:06.093
LAURA: Hop, hop, hop.

00:38:06.093 --> 00:38:07.448
SAM: It's a picture of Beauregard.

00:38:07.448 --> 00:38:09.826
(laughter)

00:38:09.826 --> 00:38:11.640
LIAM: It's just an endless Beauregard looking

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.654
at Beauregard looking at Beauregard looking
at Beauregard looking at Beauregard.

00:38:14.654 --> 00:38:17.561
MATT: Wait a second, is this
an actual live feed of Beauregard? Oh no.

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:20.614
(laughter)

00:38:20.614 --> 00:38:23.444
LIAM: It is the same painting that you did

00:38:23.444 --> 00:38:25.993
of Nicodranas, the lighthouse and the sea,

00:38:25.993 --> 00:38:30.993
but like in Yasha's room, the painting is undulating

00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:34.852
ever so imperceptibly, and as you stare at it for a moment,

00:38:34.852 --> 00:38:37.761
you start to quietly hear sounds of the city

00:38:37.761 --> 00:38:39.612
and of the ocean.
SAM: Ooh.

00:38:39.612 --> 00:38:41.172
MARISHA: Hmm.

00:38:41.172 --> 00:38:43.492
LIAM: A simple illusion.

00:38:43.492 --> 00:38:45.825
LAURA: It's wonderful, thank you.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.532
LIAM: One room left.

00:38:49.532 --> 00:38:51.250
SAM: Oh, yes!

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.091
I can't wait.
LIAM: Yeah, come.

00:38:53.091 --> 00:38:54.532
SAM: But it's not on this floor though.

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:57.142
LIAM: No--
SAM: I get my own floor?

00:38:57.142 --> 00:38:59.950
LIAM: Almost, you have to split it
with me, if that's okay.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.191
(laughter)

00:39:01.191 --> 00:39:03.031
LIAM: And I lead them out and start to hover up.

00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:04.051
SAM: Up!

00:39:04.051 --> 00:39:04.950
TRAVIS: Up.
LAURA: Up!

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.111
(laughter)

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:10.736
LIAM: There are three doors here.

00:39:10.736 --> 00:39:13.848
One is just a simple wooden door.

00:39:13.848 --> 00:39:15.040
And then, the other two,

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.440
one, the wood is stained, just a hint, green,

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.978
and the other one is stained, just a hint,

00:39:20.978 --> 00:39:25.820
there's veins of amber running through the wood.

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:30.229
I push open the ever-so-slightly green door

00:39:30.229 --> 00:39:34.260
and we see another room, where the furniture,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.360
most of it, is halfling-sized, much smaller.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.370
And there are one or two chairs for people

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.413
that are as tall as Caduceus or Yasha, say.

00:39:45.413 --> 00:39:49.825
The fireplace's stained glass depicts three halflings,

00:39:49.825 --> 00:39:53.437
walking up a country road among wildflowers.

00:39:53.437 --> 00:39:56.026
It is very clearly you and your family.

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:57.045
SAM: Love it.

00:39:57.045 --> 00:39:58.965
LIAM: The furniture, as I said, all smaller.

00:39:58.965 --> 00:40:00.896
By the fire, there is the table with the books,

00:40:00.896 --> 00:40:03.125
but there is also an earthen container,

00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:05.236
holding a variety of walking sticks.

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:07.586
All around the room are glass bowls

00:40:07.586 --> 00:40:09.586
and little open jewelry boxes, filled with

00:40:09.586 --> 00:40:13.475
either colorful gemstones, but primarily buttons.

00:40:13.475 --> 00:40:14.525
SAM: Ooh!

00:40:14.525 --> 00:40:16.372
So many trinkets.

00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:18.154
LIAM: There is in the same direction,

00:40:18.154 --> 00:40:20.803
a door that leads to your bedroom over there,

00:40:20.803 --> 00:40:22.761
but there is another door on the other side.
SAM: Oh!

00:40:22.761 --> 00:40:24.504
LIAM: We'll get to that in a moment.
SAM: Okay.

00:40:24.504 --> 00:40:27.076
LIAM: I push through and you see a child's room.

00:40:27.076 --> 00:40:29.517
SAM: (gasps)
LIAM: Full of toys,

00:40:29.517 --> 00:40:31.812
hobby horses, stuffed dolls

00:40:31.812 --> 00:40:35.845
in various forms that Frumpkin can take.

00:40:35.845 --> 00:40:37.885
Game boards, playing cards, lots of things

00:40:37.885 --> 00:40:42.385
that you can shoot, because the boy's building a habit.

00:40:42.385 --> 00:40:46.544
LAURA: And Luc's standing there going,
"Help, Mom, I don't know where I am!"

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.362
SAM: He's been here for months!

00:40:48.362 --> 00:40:49.529
(laughter)

00:40:49.529 --> 00:40:52.472
LIAM: There is a proper painting, oil painting

00:40:52.472 --> 00:40:55.604
of the Brenatto family, hanging on the wall.

00:40:55.604 --> 00:40:58.023
As I push through into your bedroom,

00:40:58.023 --> 00:41:01.644
another four-post bed that is smaller than the rest.

00:41:01.644 --> 00:41:04.793
Same tub, but Caleb runs over to the side of the bed

00:41:04.793 --> 00:41:09.112
and I pull out a sliding bed from under the first.

00:41:09.112 --> 00:41:09.945
SAM: Ooh!

00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:11.320
LIAM: So, you know.
SAM: Like a trundle.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.865
LIAM: Yes, so if Luc is ever, you know, frightened

00:41:13.865 --> 00:41:16.063
and wants to be at your side, he can be here.
SAM: That's great!

00:41:16.063 --> 00:41:19.044
LIAM: But if you and Yeza ever need some quiet time,

00:41:19.044 --> 00:41:21.804
well, he can sleep with all of his archery equipment.
SAM: Amazing!

00:41:21.804 --> 00:41:24.247
LAURA: Could you add, like, a sex swing
in here, and a whole bunch of toys?

00:41:24.247 --> 00:41:28.484
Because I have a feeling Nott-- Veth--
LIAM: Fjord, you could lend her your sex swing.

00:41:28.484 --> 00:41:31.950
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's going to be possible.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.147
(laughter)

00:41:33.147 --> 00:41:36.897
Unless, you know, everything just
cleans itself every time we leave.

00:41:36.897 --> 00:41:37.913
LIAM: It actually does.

00:41:37.913 --> 00:41:40.522
TRAVIS: Oh, any time!

00:41:40.522 --> 00:41:42.272
You just let me know.

00:41:43.777 --> 00:41:46.447
LIAM: Caleb, in a burst of energy,
pushes back through the group and says,

00:41:46.447 --> 00:41:49.420
now this is for you and me, and I push through

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.729
the door on the other side of your sitting room

00:41:51.729 --> 00:41:55.588
and enter a large laboratory and study.

00:41:55.588 --> 00:41:58.186
There is a giant slate on the wall,

00:41:58.186 --> 00:41:59.737
with chalk markings already on it,

00:41:59.737 --> 00:42:03.057
and there is a slate on the ground and there are tables

00:42:03.057 --> 00:42:07.327
with alchemical equipment and paper everywhere.

00:42:07.327 --> 00:42:11.562
Unfortunately, subpar with the quality again, but--

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:13.062
Good. It's good paper.

00:42:14.947 --> 00:42:19.947
This is for myself and for you and for Yeza,

00:42:20.211 --> 00:42:22.128
if he wants to do any work here.

00:42:22.128 --> 00:42:24.120
SAM: This is incredible. What if I make a mistake, though,

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.920
and create a bit of a blaze. Won't that affect

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.640
all of your papers and your books and things?

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.560
LIAM: Well, the beauty about this place

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.143
is that it is not exactly real.

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:39.101
So if you paint a dick on the wall and you're not

00:42:39.101 --> 00:42:43.312
that happy with it, or if you burn down your bed,

00:42:43.312 --> 00:42:47.229
when we come back again, they will all be here.

00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:50.923
And if you would rather have a
sex swing instead of your bed,

00:42:50.923 --> 00:42:53.007
you will have a sex swing.
(fingers clicking)

00:42:53.007 --> 00:42:54.691
(laughter)

00:42:54.691 --> 00:42:56.141
SAM: It's all a girl wants.
LAURA: But if we want to keep it here,

00:42:56.141 --> 00:42:58.016
we can keep it here.

00:42:58.016 --> 00:42:59.434
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Visual-wise.

00:42:59.434 --> 00:43:02.289
LIAM: Mm-hmm. If you want anything different,

00:43:02.289 --> 00:43:06.530
if I have missed anything, if I have guessed incorrectly

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:11.530
at your, you know, your passions or your tastes,

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.688
then please let me know.
SAM: You guessed perfectly.

00:43:13.688 --> 00:43:15.337
I mean, it seems--
MARISHA: Perfect.

00:43:15.337 --> 00:43:17.823
TALIESIN: This is very impressive.
SAM: Amazingly suited for us.

00:43:17.823 --> 00:43:18.656
ASHLEY: It's perfect.

00:43:18.656 --> 00:43:20.869
MARISHA: Where do we eat together?

00:43:20.869 --> 00:43:22.797
LIAM: Oh!

00:43:22.797 --> 00:43:25.722
TRAVIS: Up!
LIAM: We skipped a room, I was in such a hurry,

00:43:25.722 --> 00:43:27.972
and we zoomed right past it.

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:32.163
I start to lower down and I believe I left a couple

00:43:32.163 --> 00:43:36.127
of those irises closed, so as
we're going down I say, <i>auf</i>.

00:43:36.127 --> 00:43:41.127
<i>Auf</i>, and before the bed chambers--
Sorry, Liam is so nervous--

00:43:41.167 --> 00:43:44.800
there is another small, wooden--

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.433
nona<i>gon</i>al?

00:43:46.433 --> 00:43:47.428
Would it be "nona<i>gon</i>al"?

00:43:47.428 --> 00:43:49.877
SAM: No<i>na</i>gonal?
LIAM: No<i>na</i>gonol.

00:43:49.877 --> 00:43:51.659
MARISHA: Nine-sided.
LIAM: Another nine-sided room.

00:43:51.659 --> 00:43:55.149
There is a single door in here and I push it open

00:43:55.149 --> 00:43:57.598
and we are looking into a large,

00:43:57.598 --> 00:44:01.998
almost pie-wedged room shape,

00:44:01.998 --> 00:44:04.756
where it just spreads out to the sides,

00:44:04.756 --> 00:44:06.672
and there is a large dining table

00:44:06.672 --> 00:44:10.027
in front of a very large, crackling fire.

00:44:10.027 --> 00:44:11.166
No stained glass here.

00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:14.004
There are buffet tables, side tables,

00:44:14.004 --> 00:44:17.146
piled high with food already.

00:44:19.678 --> 00:44:21.974
There are doors, large swinging doors,

00:44:21.974 --> 00:44:24.856
on each side of this pie-shaped room.

00:44:24.856 --> 00:44:27.147
But don't--

00:44:27.147 --> 00:44:31.609
don't go in there too much, it's busy back in there.

00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:34.107
LAURA: I go in there.
(laughter)

00:44:34.107 --> 00:44:34.940
TALIESIN: I follow.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.505
LIAM: Do you go left or right?

00:44:36.505 --> 00:44:37.912
To the door on the left or to the right?

00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:39.464
LAURA: The right.
TRAVIS: Astral Dreadnought.

00:44:39.464 --> 00:44:41.782
LAURA: The right, yeah. (laughs)
TALIESIN: I'll go to the left.

00:44:41.782 --> 00:44:43.068
LIAM: Okay, so--

00:44:43.068 --> 00:44:44.516
TRAVIS: "Don't go back there."
LIAM: You walk into

00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:47.582
a large kitchen that smells instantly

00:44:47.582 --> 00:44:49.830
of baking and pastries and cakes

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.150
and cupcakes and puddings and sugars.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.329
And there are cats everywhere.

00:44:54.329 --> 00:44:55.659
TRAVIS: What?
LIAM: There are cats

00:44:55.659 --> 00:45:00.159
the size of tigers, that are just large, spectral,

00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:03.046
amber cats, and one cat walks right past you.

00:45:03.046 --> 00:45:05.982
And on top of its tail is a tray of muffins.

00:45:05.982 --> 00:45:07.285
And it just walks right by.

00:45:07.285 --> 00:45:09.393
ASHLEY: Come on!
LIAM: And little cats go running

00:45:09.393 --> 00:45:11.854
and you see one cat go running up

00:45:11.854 --> 00:45:13.664
one of these wooden aqueduct slides

00:45:13.664 --> 00:45:15.135
and then disappears into a hole

00:45:15.135 --> 00:45:16.235
in the wall.
ALL: Oh!

00:45:16.235 --> 00:45:19.222
ASHLEY: That's how they get around!
LIAM: You walk into a kitchen

00:45:19.222 --> 00:45:22.405
yourself, but in here, there are roaring fires

00:45:22.405 --> 00:45:25.197
and large pots with the smells of vegetables

00:45:25.197 --> 00:45:27.170
and meats cooking in this room.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.389
Both of you, as you are taking

00:45:29.389 --> 00:45:30.989
in the sight of many, many cats

00:45:30.989 --> 00:45:32.248
and all of this food--
LAURA: Are they cats with hands?

00:45:32.248 --> 00:45:35.010
Because, how do they actually cook?

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.283
Do all the cats have people hands?
TRAVIS: (mimicking sneezing)

00:45:37.283 --> 00:45:38.483
LIAM: You see another cat--
SAM: Another question:

00:45:38.483 --> 00:45:40.066
Do they have buttholes?

00:45:40.066 --> 00:45:41.485
(laughter)

00:45:41.485 --> 00:45:43.088
LIAM: We will put it to the test.

00:45:43.088 --> 00:45:46.399
You see one of the larger cats, the tail wrap around a stove

00:45:46.399 --> 00:45:48.216
and just go (swooshing) and open it up.

00:45:48.216 --> 00:45:50.106
SAM: With their tails?
LIAM: Another cat's tail

00:45:50.106 --> 00:45:53.974
pushes, like, a large wooden pizza oven tray

00:45:53.974 --> 00:45:56.635
and pulls out loaves of bread and then

00:45:56.635 --> 00:45:59.006
just maneuvers and carries it in and

00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:00.520
rests it down on the table.
LAURA: With their tails?

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.467
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness.
TRAVIS: Do these cats shed?

00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:06.365
SAM: Yeah, I don't think a health
inspector would like this very much.

00:46:06.365 --> 00:46:09.154
TALIESIN: I'm just going to close the door.

00:46:09.154 --> 00:46:11.813
MATT: On the wall, there's a large blue "C."

00:46:11.813 --> 00:46:14.802
TRAVIS: If I could get some Benadryl
in my room, that'd be great.

00:46:14.802 --> 00:46:15.836
TALIESIN: I don't know what I expected.

00:46:15.836 --> 00:46:20.303
LAURA: Caleb, is this above or below our bedrooms?

00:46:20.303 --> 00:46:21.136
LIAM: Below.

00:46:21.136 --> 00:46:22.267
LAURA: Below.
LIAM: Below.

00:46:22.267 --> 00:46:24.874
LAURA: Okay, could I have installed in my room,

00:46:24.874 --> 00:46:27.645
like, a little dummy elevator that can

00:46:27.645 --> 00:46:30.437
just send food directly up to my room

00:46:30.437 --> 00:46:32.117
if ever I'm hungry in the middle of the night?

00:46:32.117 --> 00:46:33.867
LIAM: It's already there.

00:46:36.447 --> 00:46:40.084
When you return to your rooms this evening to retire,

00:46:40.084 --> 00:46:43.908
next to the fireplace, there is a red rope pull.

00:46:43.908 --> 00:46:46.465
If you pull that, it will summon

00:46:46.465 --> 00:46:50.535
one of the smaller cats, but you have to let them in.

00:46:50.535 --> 00:46:53.455
There is a little metal brass doorway

00:46:53.455 --> 00:46:55.065
on the floor, and there's just a little latch,

00:46:55.065 --> 00:46:56.948
so you just open the latch--
LAURA: That's what the little doors are for?

00:46:56.948 --> 00:47:00.156
LIAM: Pull open the door and the
cat will bring you whatever that you ask it.

00:47:00.156 --> 00:47:01.737
LAURA: Amazing.
ASHLEY: Oh, it's a little door.

00:47:01.737 --> 00:47:03.020
LAURA: I love it.
SAM: Wow.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:06.479
LAURA: This is the best happy fun ball I've ever been in.

00:47:06.479 --> 00:47:09.975
LIAM: Well, I learned a lot from
that place and this is probably

00:47:09.975 --> 00:47:14.975
1000th of the size of that, but, you know, live and learn.

00:47:16.058 --> 00:47:17.901
SAM: Can we open these irises or do you have

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:20.484
to show us around all the time?

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:24.794
LIAM: Come back to the central chamber.

00:47:24.794 --> 00:47:28.330
Okay, so if you want to close it, you have to say <i>zu</i>.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:29.163
SAM: <i>Zu</i>.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:47:29.163 --> 00:47:30.927
SAM: And then, <i>auf</i>?
LIAM: It just went (mimics swooshing).

00:47:30.927 --> 00:47:32.955
Yeah, <i>auf</i> is to open it.
SAM: <i>Auf</i> and <i>zu</i>.

00:47:32.955 --> 00:47:33.788
LAURA: Auf.
MARISHA: Auf.

00:47:33.788 --> 00:47:34.846
TALIESIN: <i>Zu</i>.
MARISHA: Shoe.

00:47:34.846 --> 00:47:35.679
TALIESIN: Auf.

00:47:35.679 --> 00:47:38.516
LIAM: So, for instance, here, come with me.

00:47:38.516 --> 00:47:40.846
And Caleb just plummets down through the holes

00:47:40.846 --> 00:47:44.134
and I lead us down to the second floor,

00:47:44.134 --> 00:47:45.734
which is the large empty room.

00:47:45.734 --> 00:47:49.023
So this room-- and I start speaking presentationally

00:47:49.023 --> 00:47:51.057
and walking away from the center of the room--

00:47:51.057 --> 00:47:54.217
is very large and you can do a great many things in here.

00:47:54.217 --> 00:47:56.456
For instance, if you want to have an archery contest,

00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.457
and I slide open two of the wooden doors

00:47:59.457 --> 00:48:01.908
and you see what looks like a walk-in closet,

00:48:01.908 --> 00:48:06.017
but there are targets lined up

00:48:06.017 --> 00:48:08.497
and arrows hanging on the walls and bows.

00:48:08.497 --> 00:48:10.468
Or, forget that, and I shut the door.

00:48:10.468 --> 00:48:11.889
Maybe you want to have a party.

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.367
Maybe we are going to have some people over

00:48:13.367 --> 00:48:14.537
and we want to show them a good time.

00:48:14.537 --> 00:48:16.598
I open it up and you see stacked glasses

00:48:16.598 --> 00:48:19.531
of champagne in the same space.

00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:22.817
So none of this stuff can come with us out of here,

00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:26.838
because it's not real, but it's real here.

00:48:26.838 --> 00:48:28.258
(swooshing)

00:48:28.258 --> 00:48:30.751
SAM: We should've brought Trent here.
TALIESIN: If we leave real things

00:48:30.751 --> 00:48:33.501
in here, do they vanish or do they...?

00:48:33.501 --> 00:48:34.731
LIAM: (sighing)

00:48:34.731 --> 00:48:36.822
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out, I suppose?

00:48:36.822 --> 00:48:38.742
LIAM: Well, I've never been in here before.

00:48:38.742 --> 00:48:40.030
TALIESIN: Me neither.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.548
(laughter)

00:48:41.548 --> 00:48:43.532
LIAM: I have only thought about it a great deal.

00:48:43.532 --> 00:48:46.007
So I don't know, it would be an experiment.

00:48:46.007 --> 00:48:47.073
TALIESIN: We'll find out.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:47.073 --> 00:48:51.098
SAM: Let's just leave one small thing that that's not alive.

00:48:51.098 --> 00:48:55.039
Ooh! We'll leave your pet in here.

00:48:55.039 --> 00:48:58.305
LAURA: No!
SAM: And that way, if it's ejected at the end,

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:00.620
it won't matter.
TRAVIS: You said my room had

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.399
three portholes, but I can't see anything past the glass.

00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:06.108
And then, you said there's
something down below, but never mind.

00:49:06.108 --> 00:49:07.807
What were you talking about?

00:49:07.807 --> 00:49:08.640
LIAM: When?

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.409
TRAVIS: When we were in my room.

00:49:10.409 --> 00:49:12.147
About me.

00:49:12.147 --> 00:49:13.298
LIAM: "Something down below."

00:49:13.298 --> 00:49:15.579
TRAVIS: Yeah, and you mentioned there was
a porthole and there was nothing--

00:49:15.579 --> 00:49:17.896
LIAM: Oh, just--

00:49:17.896 --> 00:49:19.562
TRAVIS: Just Uk'otoa.
LIAM: Just the view

00:49:19.562 --> 00:49:21.570
in the entry hall.
SAM: (whispers) Uk'otoa.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.713
TRAVIS: Gotcha.
LIAM: That's all.

00:49:22.713 --> 00:49:27.379
This whole place is very slowly turning.

00:49:28.673 --> 00:49:30.348
TRAVIS: All the time?
LIAM: All of the time.

00:49:30.348 --> 00:49:32.072
It's very slow though.

00:49:32.072 --> 00:49:34.347
TRAVIS: You said we're very, very small,

00:49:34.347 --> 00:49:36.363
about a centimeter from where we are in reality.

00:49:36.363 --> 00:49:37.196
LIAM: Yeah.

00:49:37.196 --> 00:49:40.733
TRAVIS: That doesn't mean that we
can be influenced from the outside, can we?

00:49:40.733 --> 00:49:41.566
LIAM: No.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:49:41.566 --> 00:49:44.600
LIAM: No, we are apart from reality
until we walk through the door.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.552
LAURA: Why are we tiny?

00:49:46.552 --> 00:49:49.403
LIAM: Well, that's just part of the magic of it, Jester.

00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:52.109
SAM: Does this place have a name?

00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:56.061
LIAM: This is Widogast's Nascent Nein-Sided Tower.

00:49:56.061 --> 00:49:57.150
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:58.183
ASHLEY: Awesome!
(clapping)

00:49:58.183 --> 00:49:59.927
(laughter)

00:49:59.927 --> 00:50:01.530
TRAVIS: Spell "nascent," bitch.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.296
(laughter)

00:50:03.296 --> 00:50:05.054
LIAM: I'll have to read it, because I can't remember.

00:50:05.054 --> 00:50:09.224
SAM: It would have more of an alliteration
if it were Nott's Nascent Nine-Sided Tower.

00:50:09.224 --> 00:50:10.488
I'm just saying.
LIAM: Ah, but then you would

00:50:10.488 --> 00:50:12.111
have to create it, wouldn't you?

00:50:12.111 --> 00:50:13.592
SAM: You can teach me.

00:50:13.592 --> 00:50:17.353
LIAM: N-A-S-C-E-N-T.

00:50:17.353 --> 00:50:19.095
LAURA: I'm not writing that down.

00:50:19.095 --> 00:50:20.225
LIAM: That's fine.

00:50:20.225 --> 00:50:23.116
TRAVIS: Widowgast's Nascent Nine-Sided Tower.

00:50:23.116 --> 00:50:25.857
SAM: The only drawback is there's only one bathroom.

00:50:25.857 --> 00:50:28.607
Sorry.
(laughter)

00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:31.882
TALIESIN: One bathroom, one sink.

00:50:31.882 --> 00:50:33.199
SAM: (laughs) Yep.

00:50:33.199 --> 00:50:34.687
LAURA: Anytime we have to pee, we just have to think

00:50:34.687 --> 00:50:37.887
about there being a toilet and there will be one, right?

00:50:37.887 --> 00:50:39.977
LIAM: Well, there is a chamberpot in your room,

00:50:39.977 --> 00:50:41.916
but if you want to come down here

00:50:41.916 --> 00:50:44.986
and open one of these closets, yeah, you could.

00:50:44.986 --> 00:50:46.169
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:48.085
LIAM: If you wanted to pee in a tuba--
LAURA: So if you need to take a massive-- (laughs)

00:50:48.085 --> 00:50:50.504
LIAM: -- you'd just hope for a tuba.
TRAVIS: In a tuba?

00:50:50.504 --> 00:50:51.337
LIAM: Yeah.

00:50:51.337 --> 00:50:53.664
SAM: Pee in tubas.

00:50:53.664 --> 00:50:54.662
LIAM: Well.

00:50:54.662 --> 00:50:55.742
SAM: This is incredible.

00:50:55.742 --> 00:50:56.575
LIAM: Anyway.

00:50:57.411 --> 00:50:58.244
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:58.244 --> 00:51:01.561
LAURA: This is amazing, Caleb.
MARISHA: This is amazing.

00:51:01.561 --> 00:51:06.161
LIAM: Well, you are all amazing.

00:51:06.161 --> 00:51:09.411
And it wasn't that long ago

00:51:11.008 --> 00:51:13.398
that I would have trouble admitting that,

00:51:13.398 --> 00:51:17.939
but I would not be here without you people.

00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:21.292
And I value you.

00:51:22.899 --> 00:51:24.310
And there's not much I can do.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:26.328
I cannot do a pushup like this one does.

00:51:26.328 --> 00:51:30.126
I do not know anything about horticulture.

00:51:30.126 --> 00:51:32.518
I couldn't find my way around the ocean.

00:51:32.518 --> 00:51:37.278
I don't have an ounce of your flair and creativity.

00:51:37.278 --> 00:51:41.086
LAURA: Obviously, yes you do, because you just made this.

00:51:41.086 --> 00:51:42.886
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:42.886 --> 00:51:44.467
LAURA: So come up with something else that I do

00:51:44.467 --> 00:51:47.184
that's cool, because you just took mine.

00:51:47.184 --> 00:51:49.176
LIAM: You're hilarious.
LAURA: Okay.

00:51:55.883 --> 00:51:59.647
LIAM: I could not scare the ever living shit

00:51:59.647 --> 00:52:02.685
out of people the way you do.

00:52:02.685 --> 00:52:04.493
ASHLEY: Thank you.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:52:04.493 --> 00:52:05.590
TRAVIS: Crunch.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.058
(laughter)

00:52:07.058 --> 00:52:08.719
LAURA: You just have the bugs in your pocket.

00:52:08.719 --> 00:52:10.969
(laughter)

00:52:11.857 --> 00:52:14.690
LIAM: And you are my best friend, so.

00:52:15.888 --> 00:52:18.329
SAM: It's going to be so fun to romp around

00:52:18.329 --> 00:52:22.169
this place with all of you.

00:52:22.169 --> 00:52:24.660
MARISHA: Are the walls...

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:25.843
thick? Can you--

00:52:25.843 --> 00:52:28.174
Can you hear through walls?
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:52:28.174 --> 00:52:31.006
MARISHA: It's a valid question.
TRAVIS: Just calm down a little bit.

00:52:31.006 --> 00:52:32.586
We just got here.
MARISHA: I just want to make sure.

00:52:32.586 --> 00:52:34.457
LIAM: Well, the outer walls--

00:52:34.457 --> 00:52:36.133
SAM: Are you a loud masturbator?
LIAM: There is nothing

00:52:36.133 --> 00:52:38.694
outside of them except for a pocket dimension,

00:52:38.694 --> 00:52:40.635
but if you're speaking about your bedroom,

00:52:40.635 --> 00:52:42.052
I believe they will suffice.

00:52:42.052 --> 00:52:44.075
And if you would like, the next time I create this,

00:52:44.075 --> 00:52:46.207
I can line your walls with lead or

00:52:46.207 --> 00:52:48.871
cotton or, you know.
(laughter)

00:52:48.871 --> 00:52:50.088
SAM: Or that soundproofing stuff?
MARISHA: Excellent.

00:52:50.088 --> 00:52:51.622
LIAM: Mm-hmm, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, good to know.

00:52:51.622 --> 00:52:53.645
LIAM: Some of that egg crate-y stuff

00:52:53.645 --> 00:52:55.150
that they had at the V.O. community.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:57.081
MARISHA: Oh, right.
SAM: Yes, they did.

00:52:57.081 --> 00:52:58.883
(laughter)

00:52:58.883 --> 00:53:01.893
TRAVIS: You said this costs you
a great deal, it requires focus.

00:53:01.893 --> 00:53:03.309
LIAM: Well, it's--

00:53:05.235 --> 00:53:08.336
I can either whisk us from one side of the planet

00:53:08.336 --> 00:53:12.365
to the other, or I can bring this into existence.

00:53:12.365 --> 00:53:14.785
SAM: Oh, it costs magic, but you don't have

00:53:14.785 --> 00:53:18.344
to spend 1000 gold every time we come home or anything.

00:53:18.344 --> 00:53:22.024
LIAM: No, just the man hours it took me conceiving of it.

00:53:22.024 --> 00:53:23.310
But no.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:26.919
SAM: It was worth it, it's so excellent.

00:53:26.919 --> 00:53:28.563
Wow.
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is incredible.

00:53:28.563 --> 00:53:30.563
SAM: Well, should we have a

00:53:31.422 --> 00:53:34.064
cat dinner and retire for the evening?

00:53:34.064 --> 00:53:36.395
LIAM: Well, it would be second dinners,

00:53:36.395 --> 00:53:37.842
but we could have a drink.

00:53:37.842 --> 00:53:39.204
SAM: Oh, did we already eat?

00:53:39.204 --> 00:53:40.893
LIAM: With, yeah.

00:53:40.893 --> 00:53:42.767
SAM: Oh, that's right. That was today.

00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:44.724
LIAM: Yeah.

00:53:44.724 --> 00:53:47.024
Let's go to the salon.
LAURA: We didn't really eat.

00:53:47.024 --> 00:53:50.397
Most of us didn't eat there.
TRAVIS: Up!

00:53:50.397 --> 00:53:52.330
ASHLEY: I didn't eat.
LIAM: Anything that you would like.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.236
Yeah, oh, all right, well,

00:53:54.236 --> 00:53:56.101
let's pass the salon, we'll go to dinner.

00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:58.098
LAURA: And I didn't get dessert, you know?

00:53:58.098 --> 00:54:00.879
We had steak, but what is steak without some cake after it?

00:54:00.879 --> 00:54:03.231
MARISHA: I almost asked him about dessert, but I felt like,

00:54:03.231 --> 00:54:05.701
you know, I didn't want to stay any longer.
LAURA: We overstayed our welcome.

00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:07.859
TALIESIN: Oh, dessert in a doggy bag would've been a great--

00:54:07.859 --> 00:54:11.482
MARISHA: I know.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:54:11.482 --> 00:54:12.462
TALIESIN: That would have been amazing.

00:54:12.462 --> 00:54:14.920
MARISHA: Brilliant wizard, didn't think about a doggy bag.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.213
(laughter)

00:54:17.213 --> 00:54:19.931
ASHLEY: I'm really mad I didn't try that steak.
TALIESIN: Not so smart.

00:54:19.931 --> 00:54:21.805
LAURA: It's okay, I bet you can try it here.
SAM and ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:54:21.805 --> 00:54:24.088
LAURA: Maybe we can think about
exactly the flavors that it was.

00:54:24.088 --> 00:54:27.721
MARISHA: And we can recreate it.
SAM: Tell the cats to make you up a steak.

00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:29.638
I'm sure they're great cooks.

00:54:31.837 --> 00:54:32.920
MATT: Okay.

00:54:34.149 --> 00:54:37.141
LIAM: All right, so we all sit at that table then,

00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:39.392
the large table on the dining level,

00:54:39.392 --> 00:54:41.140
which is in the giant pie-shaped--

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:46.080
it's one piece of the nine-sided shape of the tower.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.488
And I pick up a little bell.

00:54:48.488 --> 00:54:49.321
And...

00:54:50.741 --> 00:54:54.145
streams of amber cats come running into the room.

00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:55.603
TRAVIS: (mimicking sneezing)
(laughter)

00:54:55.603 --> 00:54:56.765
LIAM: No, they are--

00:54:56.765 --> 00:54:57.787
TRAVIS: Hypoallergenic?

00:54:57.787 --> 00:55:00.755
LIAM: They are fey.
TRAVIS: Brilliant.

00:55:00.755 --> 00:55:03.780
LIAM: And the table on both sides has

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.069
little corgi ramps up the side.

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:08.151
So the cats just pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip.

00:55:08.151 --> 00:55:09.662
And--
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:55:09.662 --> 00:55:12.440
LIAM: -- amongst the plates and the
beautiful goblets around us,

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.431
there are little orange tails just walking around.

00:55:15.431 --> 00:55:17.224
TALIESIN: Are the cats in formal wear?
ASHLEY: (mimicking cat)

00:55:17.224 --> 00:55:18.578
TALIESIN: Their little bow ties.

00:55:18.578 --> 00:55:20.275
LIAM: No, they are not dressed.
TRAVIS: Next time.

00:55:20.275 --> 00:55:22.355
LIAM: That would be ridiculous, Caduceus.

00:55:22.355 --> 00:55:26.159
(laughter)
(clapping)

00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:28.992
LAURA: Do any of them play instruments?

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.540
LIAM: Methuselah!

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.589
TRAVIS: "Methuselah"!
(laughter)

00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:35.818
TALIESIN: I'm dying.

00:55:35.818 --> 00:55:37.321
TRAVIS: Do they have buttholes?

00:55:37.321 --> 00:55:38.715
(laughter)

00:55:38.715 --> 00:55:40.132
TALIESIN: How else can they play the tuba?

00:55:40.132 --> 00:55:41.769
Be serious.
(laughter)

00:55:41.769 --> 00:55:42.788
TRAVIS: True.
LIAM: Methuselah,

00:55:42.788 --> 00:55:46.238
bring your violin and your butthole.

00:55:46.238 --> 00:55:48.238
ASHLEY: Where's Mr. Mistoffelees?

00:55:48.238 --> 00:55:49.967
LAURA and ASHLEY: Aww.

00:55:49.967 --> 00:55:54.077
LIAM: (sighs) He's further back in.

00:55:54.077 --> 00:55:55.679
ASHLEY: That's a Cats character, right?

00:55:55.679 --> 00:55:57.228
MARISHA: Yes. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees.

00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:59.002
TRAVIS: We still haven't watched it, we need to watch that.

00:55:59.002 --> 00:56:01.452
LAURA: Wait, wait, I'm trying to think

00:56:01.452 --> 00:56:03.932
the name of the one, Rum Tum.

00:56:03.932 --> 00:56:06.892
MARISHA: Rum Tum Tugger.
MATT: Rum Tum Tugger.

00:56:06.892 --> 00:56:08.204
Nah.
TALIESIN: (laughs)

00:56:08.204 --> 00:56:10.539
ASHLEY: That's quite a name.

00:56:10.539 --> 00:56:12.469
MATT: Yeah, that's a lot of the Cats experience.

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:13.860
"That's quite a name."

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.416
(laughter)

00:56:15.416 --> 00:56:16.249
TRAVIS: (sighing)

00:56:16.249 --> 00:56:18.007
MARISHA: Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat.

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:21.613
LIAM: So a larger--

00:56:21.613 --> 00:56:24.002
a larger amber cat, that is the size of a tiger,

00:56:24.002 --> 00:56:26.162
and a smaller one come walking in together.

00:56:26.162 --> 00:56:30.042
The larger cat's tail is carrying a violin

00:56:30.042 --> 00:56:33.280
and the smaller cat is carrying the bow.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.010
They stand next to Yasha.

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:37.189
The larger cat's tail extends out

00:56:37.189 --> 00:56:40.038
and holds the violin and the smaller one's tail goes up

00:56:40.038 --> 00:56:44.197
and starts playing the violin that the other is holding.

00:56:44.197 --> 00:56:49.040
And you can see a small fairy butthole

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.229
on the smaller cat as it plays.

00:56:51.229 --> 00:56:52.949
SAM: Yes, it's flexing every time.

00:56:52.949 --> 00:56:54.720
ASHLEY: I have a feeling they play much better than I do.

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.650
(laughter)

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:59.109
With my low...

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:03.210
TRAVIS: I bet they'll follow your lead.

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:05.025
LAURA: That's true, if you want to join them.

00:57:05.025 --> 00:57:05.858
TRAVIS: Throw in some harmony.

00:57:05.858 --> 00:57:07.783
LIAM: Shanks, I believe we want--
TALIESIN: Now, you have a band.

00:57:07.783 --> 00:57:09.643
(laughter)

00:57:09.643 --> 00:57:11.426
SAM: Fucking weird.

00:57:12.268 --> 00:57:14.215
TRAVIS: He's been in prison.

00:57:14.215 --> 00:57:17.282
LIAM: I believe we would like dessert.
TRAVIS: A super dangerous cat.

00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:24.001
ASHLEY: Could I-- ever since I had them on the boat,

00:57:24.089 --> 00:57:27.322
could I just get some pancakes?

00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:29.501
Just, like, a stack of them?

00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:31.071
Oh.

00:57:31.071 --> 00:57:32.087
SAM: Oh wow.
(laughter)

00:57:32.087 --> 00:57:35.087
MARISHA: We got braids, we got pancakes, oh man!

00:57:35.087 --> 00:57:36.577
ASHLEY: We are in the groove.

00:57:36.577 --> 00:57:39.310
ASHLEY: Yasha, as you say that to Caleb,

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:40.841
there is a cat right in front of you

00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:42.207
and you hear it go (purring)

00:57:42.207 --> 00:57:44.201
and it just runs off the table

00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:47.310
and disappears into a hole in the wall.

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:50.030
And, 30 seconds later, the double doors open up

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:52.029
and that cat and three others behind it

00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:54.494
come out with little plates of pancakes,

00:57:54.494 --> 00:57:56.880
held impossibly on a curved tail.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.888
They walk up the little corgi ramp onto the table

00:58:00.888 --> 00:58:02.619
and set them down in front of you.

00:58:02.619 --> 00:58:03.969
And they had a feeling about you,

00:58:03.969 --> 00:58:05.813
so there are pancakes in front of you as well.

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.675
MARISHA: Kitty cats--

00:58:09.675 --> 00:58:11.741
Do I talk to you when I address the cats?

00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:13.531
Kitty cats, who do I talk to?
LIAM: It's up to you.

00:58:13.531 --> 00:58:15.323
Whatever you're comfortable with, Beauregard.

00:58:15.323 --> 00:58:19.078
MARISHA: I request to the cats, some of

00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:20.910
some Lionett Wine.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:21.843
LIAM: Some Lionett wine?

00:58:21.843 --> 00:58:24.669
MARISHA: Can they do that?
Here, I hand them a little sample.

00:58:24.669 --> 00:58:26.940
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: Re-create that!

00:58:28.548 --> 00:58:29.918
I want to see what they can do.

00:58:29.918 --> 00:58:34.268
LIAM: The cat tail again, like an octopus' tentacle,

00:58:34.268 --> 00:58:36.418
just this cat tail wraps around it

00:58:36.418 --> 00:58:39.001
and it's lifted, and that cat-- (mrrp)--

00:58:39.001 --> 00:58:41.126
runs off the table and disappears.

00:58:41.126 --> 00:58:44.834
And then a little, almost like a triangle

00:58:44.834 --> 00:58:49.218
pyramid of bowling pins, 10 cats come in with wine bottles

00:58:49.218 --> 00:58:53.148
and then another 10 come in with wine glasses,

00:58:53.148 --> 00:58:56.488
because this is for cocktails.

00:58:56.488 --> 00:58:59.478
So wine starts to be poured from cats

00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:02.308
in front of everyone.
MARISHA: How'd they get so many varieties

00:59:02.308 --> 00:59:04.868
from that one sample?

00:59:04.868 --> 00:59:06.768
Oh wow.
SAM: Complicated flavor.

00:59:06.768 --> 00:59:09.848
LIAM: None of it will be here in the morning.

00:59:09.848 --> 00:59:14.568
Also, you'll notice the clocks on the walls in here--

00:59:14.568 --> 00:59:16.098
and you're seeing them for the first time--

00:59:16.098 --> 00:59:18.638
those are on every floor and in your chambers,

00:59:18.638 --> 00:59:21.546
they are beautiful, a little sort of...

00:59:23.348 --> 00:59:24.831
whimsical clockwork,

00:59:25.978 --> 00:59:30.178
clocks, where there is a sun and a moon and it is the--

00:59:30.178 --> 00:59:31.538
it shows the time

00:59:32.888 --> 00:59:35.051
in the location where we left.

00:59:36.208 --> 00:59:39.638
So if we came here on the dead of night, as you can see,

00:59:39.638 --> 00:59:43.028
the moon is on high on that clock and we will be able

00:59:43.028 --> 00:59:45.353
to easily keep track. I mean, for me,

00:59:45.353 --> 00:59:47.277
I don't need it, but for you,

00:59:47.277 --> 00:59:50.267
you can remember how long we've been in here.

00:59:50.267 --> 00:59:52.198
TALIESIN: I was going to ask, does time move

00:59:52.198 --> 00:59:55.491
the same way in here, is time relative?

00:59:56.608 --> 01:00:01.508
LIAM: I believe it is relative, but the clocks are locked

01:00:01.508 --> 01:00:05.108
to the Material Plane we are familiar with.

01:00:05.108 --> 01:00:10.108
TALIESIN: So if things-- if we are here,
the time should move at the same time?

01:00:10.308 --> 01:00:12.983
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

01:00:12.983 --> 01:00:14.468
TRAVIS: Not like the Happy Fun Ball.

01:00:15.628 --> 01:00:18.218
LIAM: No, I mean that is--

01:00:18.218 --> 01:00:21.928
I might pore over books my entire life

01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:23.468
and not achieve that.

01:00:23.468 --> 01:00:26.237
TALIESIN: Oh, is there a time limit, too?

01:00:26.237 --> 01:00:27.605
LIAM: Ah yeah, 24 hours.

01:00:27.605 --> 01:00:29.428
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fine.

01:00:29.428 --> 01:00:30.978
LAURA: That's a good amount of time.

01:00:32.778 --> 01:00:35.248
ASHLEY: I take some bugs out of my pocket.

01:00:35.248 --> 01:00:37.668
Start pulling off legs and things,

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:40.346
and sprinkling it on top of the pancakes.

01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:42.018
(laughter)

01:00:42.018 --> 01:00:44.543
MARISHA: Can I have one of those?
LAURA: Ooh!

01:00:44.543 --> 01:00:47.055
MARISHA: Yasha, can I have one of those bugs?

01:00:47.055 --> 01:00:49.067
I don't know if I've ever tried one.

01:00:49.067 --> 01:00:52.378
ASHLEY: You're going to love it,
it's like putting bacon on something.

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:53.211
MARISHA: Oh, really?

01:00:53.211 --> 01:00:55.878
ASHLEY: Salty, and a little kick.
MARISHA: Makes everything better.

01:00:55.878 --> 01:00:58.511
LIAM: Napoleon, give me your wasps!

01:00:58.511 --> 01:01:00.814
ASHLEY: Tina, come get some ham.

01:01:00.814 --> 01:01:03.203
(laughter)

01:01:03.203 --> 01:01:04.996
ASHLEY: Like it?

01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:07.498
MARISHA: It's pretty fucking great.
ASHLEY: Yeah, right?

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:10.443
MARISHA: I didn't know it was going to have a creamy center.

01:01:10.443 --> 01:01:11.684
LAURA: (vomiting)

01:01:11.684 --> 01:01:13.618
(laughter)

01:01:13.618 --> 01:01:15.998
ASHLEY: With something sweet.
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:01:15.998 --> 01:01:18.268
ASHLEY: It's a good combo.

01:01:18.268 --> 01:01:20.828
MARISHA: It gets a little in your teeth.
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

01:01:20.828 --> 01:01:23.768
ASHLEY: It does, but--
MARISHA: It's not bad, though.

01:01:23.768 --> 01:01:25.518
ASHLEY: It's not bad, it's not bad.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:28.480
TRAVIS: Slimy yet--
MATT: -- satisfying.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.287
MARISHA: (laughs) Aww.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:32.875
TALIESIN: Only if you don't cook it right.
LIAM: Hey, may I try one?

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:33.718
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:01:33.718 --> 01:01:36.878
LIAM: A cat just scoops it out of your hand with its tail

01:01:36.878 --> 01:01:38.478
and runs it over to me.

01:01:43.488 --> 01:01:45.278
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Mmm!

01:01:45.278 --> 01:01:47.978
ASHLEY: It takes a while to get used to,
but it's very high in protein.

01:01:47.978 --> 01:01:50.678
LIAM: It did not stop moving.
LAURA: (vomiting)

01:01:50.678 --> 01:01:52.708
MARISHA: Yeah, sometimes the legs

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.270
they'll try and fight you.

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:57.009
LIAM: Maybe I should have de-legged it first, yeah.

01:01:57.009 --> 01:01:57.842
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:02:01.528 --> 01:02:03.153
MARISHA: Pretty good, though.
ASHLEY: Thanks.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:04.878
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I think it's pretty good, too.

01:02:06.006 --> 01:02:07.715
LAURA: This is amazing.
ASHLEY: This is amazing.

01:02:07.715 --> 01:02:09.328
MARISHA: This is amazing, Caleb.

01:02:09.328 --> 01:02:11.008
LIAM: You get a good night's sleep in here.

01:02:11.008 --> 01:02:11.841
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:02:11.841 --> 01:02:15.758
LIAM: And, you know, obviously it will not work always,

01:02:15.758 --> 01:02:20.138
but I designed it so that you could bring your family

01:02:21.148 --> 01:02:22.133
when it makes sense.

01:02:22.133 --> 01:02:26.588
SAM: I gathered that, and as long
as they won't be, you know,

01:02:26.588 --> 01:02:28.888
kicked out of it when we leave, it's perfect.

01:02:28.888 --> 01:02:30.988
I can have them close at hand.

01:02:30.988 --> 01:02:33.405
LIAM: Well, they cannot, no--

01:02:33.405 --> 01:02:34.238
I mean--

01:02:35.408 --> 01:02:40.408
I am not sure if they can stay in here when <i>we</i> leave it.

01:02:40.698 --> 01:02:45.378
It would just be for when it is safe to use

01:02:45.378 --> 01:02:47.398
but all the time that we are here in Rexxentrum

01:02:47.398 --> 01:02:50.438
and renting the room, I thought that maybe

01:02:50.438 --> 01:02:51.738
they could stay with us for the week.

01:02:51.738 --> 01:02:53.971
SAM: Absolutely! Long stretches like this are perfect.

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.902
LIAM: Yeah, and Zadash, we can take them and this to Zadash.

01:02:56.902 --> 01:03:00.958
SAM: Perfect, yes, it's awesome, we should gather them soon.

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:02.943
Wait, are we going to Zadash?

01:03:04.137 --> 01:03:06.168
MARISHA: We talked about it.

01:03:06.168 --> 01:03:07.951
SAM: Like, tomorrow?

01:03:09.034 --> 01:03:11.538
TRAVIS: I thought so, we were going
to visit The Gentleman, yes?

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:12.629
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:03:12.629 --> 01:03:17.445
And maybe do a little Pumat drive through?

01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:20.240
TALIESIN: I have something I'd like to get, possibly.

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:22.198
LIAM: What was that?

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:25.028
TALIESIN: I'd like to visit Pumat's, and

01:03:25.028 --> 01:03:28.898
see if we can get a lead on Eyes of Nine.

01:03:28.898 --> 01:03:30.481
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah.

01:03:31.339 --> 01:03:32.598
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:32.598 --> 01:03:35.984
SAM: Well then, let's get some sleep and head out.

01:03:35.984 --> 01:03:37.059
LAURA: Up!

01:03:38.168 --> 01:03:41.451
LIAM: Oh, you have to be in the center of the tower, Jester.

01:03:42.858 --> 01:03:45.631
SAM: She was just saying what
she wants to watch on TV tonight.

01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:47.108
(laughter)

01:03:47.108 --> 01:03:49.248
It's a voice control remote.

01:03:49.248 --> 01:03:52.461
LAURA: Can I ride the dummy waiter in my room?

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.688
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:03:54.688 --> 01:03:57.538
SAM: I love that you call them "dummy waiter,"
not just "dumbwaiter".

01:03:57.538 --> 01:03:59.458
LIAM: You might be able to--
LAURA: Oh. (laughs)

01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:01.478
(laughter)

01:04:01.478 --> 01:04:04.708
LIAM: -- on a different night, if I shrink you.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:05.866
TRAVIS: Whoops.

01:04:05.866 --> 01:04:07.208
LAURA: Ohh.

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:09.928
LIAM: Or you could wait, and I suppose I could--
LAURA: I'd have to be the size of a cat.

01:04:09.928 --> 01:04:11.978
SAM: You can Polymorph into a cat.

01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:13.161
LIAM: That's true.

01:04:13.161 --> 01:04:16.168
SAM: Ooh, you could Polymorph into a cat
and run around all those cool ramps!

01:04:16.168 --> 01:04:18.042
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
ASHLEY: (gasps)

01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:19.475
LAURA: I do that.

01:04:19.475 --> 01:04:21.138
Make sure I have the spell.

01:04:21.138 --> 01:04:22.971
MATT: Right now?
LAURA: Yes!

01:04:22.971 --> 01:04:27.166
MATT: Jester just (poofing) this tiny little cat.

01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:28.141
LAURA: I'm blue.

01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:30.951
LIAM: All the other cats go wild-- (meows)

01:04:34.353 --> 01:04:36.988
Like a school of fish,

01:04:36.988 --> 01:04:38.918
there are amber cats

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.261
all around the blue cat.

01:04:41.123 --> 01:04:43.065
LAURA: (cat chirping)

01:04:43.065 --> 01:04:45.353
LIAM: Are you making a beeline for one of those holes?

01:04:45.353 --> 01:04:46.203
LAURA: Yes.

01:04:46.203 --> 01:04:50.929
LIAM: Okay, they are dimly lit from the inside,

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:55.928
and you enter one and it takes you up an incline,

01:04:55.928 --> 01:05:00.928
and we see this blue cat running close to the ceiling

01:05:00.948 --> 01:05:02.968
in this room up, disappears into a hole,

01:05:02.968 --> 01:05:05.448
comes out another one goes down a ramp and disappears.

01:05:05.448 --> 01:05:08.228
You find yourself in the other kitchen,

01:05:08.228 --> 01:05:12.828
now with more savory foods and vegetables and meats cooking,

01:05:12.828 --> 01:05:16.838
and you go past into another hole, and enter a chamber

01:05:16.838 --> 01:05:19.858
that you have not seen before, and in here

01:05:19.858 --> 01:05:23.774
the aqueduct-like structure

01:05:23.774 --> 01:05:26.665
is very complex and <i>everywhere</i>.

01:05:26.665 --> 01:05:30.301
And there are ribbons hanging all over the room

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:32.716
with bells hanging from them.

01:05:32.716 --> 01:05:34.278
And there are little cats that--

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:36.858
you are in the CPU of my home.

01:05:36.858 --> 01:05:39.928
And there are cats moving in all directions,

01:05:39.928 --> 01:05:42.298
going up, going down, going left, going right.

01:05:42.298 --> 01:05:45.231
You pop out, go through a hole on the other side,

01:05:45.231 --> 01:05:47.238
and you find yourself in the bakery,

01:05:47.238 --> 01:05:48.428
again, on the other side.

01:05:48.428 --> 01:05:51.738
TRAVIS: Downton Abbey, there's drama happening back there.

01:05:51.738 --> 01:05:52.571
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:56.704
LIAM: You follow a ramp down and find yourself running along

01:05:56.704 --> 01:06:00.328
the top track inside the large empty chamber

01:06:00.328 --> 01:06:01.521
that is below here.

01:06:02.608 --> 01:06:06.998
If you continue to go, you can reach every place in here

01:06:06.998 --> 01:06:08.898
except for the bedrooms,

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:12.428
because you need to be admitted by the occupant.

01:06:12.428 --> 01:06:15.184
LAURA: Okay, what about the guest room?

01:06:17.788 --> 01:06:19.138
LIAM: I mean, you can go check.

01:06:22.508 --> 01:06:25.028
I don't know if you've ever been there
or if you know how to get there.

01:06:25.028 --> 01:06:27.419
LAURA: Nope, I'm just going to get completely lost

01:06:27.419 --> 01:06:29.578
for the next hour that I am a cat.

01:06:29.578 --> 01:06:31.239
MATT: And you do, you get extremely lost.

01:06:31.239 --> 01:06:33.628
(laughter)

01:06:33.628 --> 01:06:34.736
LAURA: Cool.

01:06:34.736 --> 01:06:37.269
Wherever I end up at the end of the hour,

01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:39.348
I guess I'll just bamf back to me and wander--

01:06:39.348 --> 01:06:42.648
LIAM: An hour later, you are
running along a track and go boom,

01:06:42.648 --> 01:06:46.088
and find yourself hanging between the windows

01:06:46.088 --> 01:06:49.208
for dunamancy and abjuration,

01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:52.458
20 feet above the floor of the entry hall.

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:54.062
TALIESIN: Metaphor.

01:06:54.062 --> 01:06:55.845
LAURA: Up?

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.872
LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't work on the wall.

01:06:57.872 --> 01:06:58.855
LAURA: Up!

01:06:58.855 --> 01:07:00.098
(laughter)

01:07:00.098 --> 01:07:02.025
TRAVIS: You're in trouble.

01:07:02.025 --> 01:07:04.322
LAURA: Oh no!
TRAVIS: Take the damage, you dumb cat.

01:07:04.322 --> 01:07:05.390
(laughter)

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:06.498
LAURA: Oh no!

01:07:09.713 --> 01:07:11.151
Um-- (laughs nervously)

01:07:11.151 --> 01:07:12.838
TALIESIN: Call for help.

01:07:12.838 --> 01:07:14.012
MARISHA: Just stay there all night.

01:07:14.012 --> 01:07:16.526
LAURA: Help!

01:07:16.526 --> 01:07:18.888
MATT: Everyone else is like super full and tired,

01:07:18.888 --> 01:07:20.768
and going off to their respective rooms

01:07:20.768 --> 01:07:21.888
to sleep for the night.

01:07:21.888 --> 01:07:23.496
LAURA: Help, it's Jester!

01:07:24.435 --> 01:07:25.271
Help me!

01:07:25.271 --> 01:07:27.368
LIAM: You notice after a minute of this,

01:07:27.368 --> 01:07:30.178
that about 100 amber cats have joined

01:07:30.178 --> 01:07:34.244
in a massive clump underneath you, 20 feet down.

01:07:34.244 --> 01:07:35.235
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: And they are

01:07:35.235 --> 01:07:39.984
piling on top of each other,
World War Z-style beneath you.

01:07:39.984 --> 01:07:42.301
LAURA: Thank you, cats. I'm going to let go now.

01:07:42.301 --> 01:07:43.811
TRAVIS: You're going to kill them.

01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:46.468
LAURA: Did I smush them?

01:07:46.468 --> 01:07:48.722
Several of them go-- (popping, exploding noises)

01:07:48.722 --> 01:07:51.404
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh, no!
(laughter)

01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:53.748
LIAM: But it does break your fall.

01:07:53.748 --> 01:07:54.981
(laughter)

01:07:54.981 --> 01:07:56.380
TRAVIS: No!

01:07:57.424 --> 01:08:00.765
You killed cats in your first day.
LAURA: Oh no!

01:08:00.765 --> 01:08:04.283
ASHLEY: Yeah, they'll regenerate.
TRAVIS: The first day!

01:08:04.283 --> 01:08:06.951
LAURA: I'm sorry, cats!

01:08:06.951 --> 01:08:08.363
SAM: They got nine lives.
ASHLEY: (poof)

01:08:08.363 --> 01:08:09.196
TALIESIN: They're like Meeseeks,

01:08:09.196 --> 01:08:11.885
nonexistence is torture.
LAURA: You're all very kind.

01:08:11.885 --> 01:08:15.626
I'll go to the center of the room and say: Up.

01:08:15.626 --> 01:08:18.423
LAURA: <i>Auf, auf</i>!
MATT: Fishing king crab,

01:08:18.423 --> 01:08:20.043
being an amber cat in this magic tower.

01:08:20.043 --> 01:08:21.748
LAURA: Yeah, I'm trying to get up to my room. (laughs)

01:08:21.748 --> 01:08:23.082
MATT: Hard life.

01:08:24.118 --> 01:08:26.730
Well, that's the easiest hour
I've ever had to dungeon master.

01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:27.745
SAM: Hey!

01:08:28.579 --> 01:08:30.078
LAURA: An hour!

01:08:30.078 --> 01:08:31.028
MATT: That was awesome.

01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:33.876
ASHLEY: Beautiful.
LIAM: Is everyone going to bed?

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:34.801
Is that what happened?
SAM: I think so.

01:08:34.801 --> 01:08:37.118
TALIESIN: Oh.
SAM: Yeah, we have stuff to do.

01:08:37.118 --> 01:08:39.968
LIAM: Okay, well the last thing, then,

01:08:39.968 --> 01:08:42.818
and Caleb would have gone and maybe hung out in the salon

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:45.218
for a while, waiting till everyone went to bed.

01:08:45.218 --> 01:08:48.038
And when he heard the cats explode down below,

01:08:48.038 --> 01:08:50.418
he knew that Jester was on her way to bed,

01:08:50.418 --> 01:08:53.948
and he would have waited another hour beyond that,

01:08:53.948 --> 01:08:55.778
just leafing through a book.

01:08:55.778 --> 01:08:58.321
And once the tower was still,

01:08:59.338 --> 01:09:01.518
he would walk into the center of the tower

01:09:01.518 --> 01:09:03.008
and start to levitate up

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:07.618
past the dining level,

01:09:07.618 --> 01:09:10.808
past the lower bedrooms,

01:09:10.808 --> 01:09:12.508
the middle bedrooms,

01:09:12.508 --> 01:09:13.791
the upper bedrooms,

01:09:14.982 --> 01:09:16.848
and once he's in the small chamber

01:09:17.688 --> 01:09:22.688
where Veth and Caleb's rooms are, he looks up and says:

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.971
<i>Fort, doch nicht vergessen.</i>

01:09:27.971 --> 01:09:31.208
And a brass iris opens

01:09:31.208 --> 01:09:34.233
and he floats up in there and says:

01:09:34.233 --> 01:09:36.308
<i>Zu.</i>

01:09:36.308 --> 01:09:38.921
And looks around the small--

01:09:40.618 --> 01:09:42.008
well, medium sized wooden room

01:09:42.008 --> 01:09:45.278
that he's in with the nine doors in it, and counts

01:09:45.278 --> 01:09:50.278
and says: <i>Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs.</i>

01:09:50.768 --> 01:09:55.211
And he opens it and walks into

01:09:55.211 --> 01:09:57.360
a large,

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.735
surprisingly large stone room,

01:10:00.735 --> 01:10:03.598
shabby-looking, and there are three

01:10:05.338 --> 01:10:07.618
wooden chairs spread out

01:10:07.618 --> 01:10:11.098
with leather straps hanging off of them

01:10:11.098 --> 01:10:16.098
and there is an old crusted over metal rolling tray

01:10:16.548 --> 01:10:21.545
with some tools sitting on it and green, gritty dust on it

01:10:22.687 --> 01:10:26.571
and matted disgusting hay in one corner.

01:10:29.278 --> 01:10:31.768
He walks forward and sits down

01:10:31.768 --> 01:10:33.676
in the middle wooden chair.

01:10:33.676 --> 01:10:37.826
There are torches hanging on the wall,
illuminating it in here.

01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:58.331
He thinks about the dinner,

01:11:00.238 --> 01:11:01.848
and just sits there for a long time,

01:11:01.848 --> 01:11:03.521
and eventually falls asleep.

01:11:04.988 --> 01:11:05.821
MATT: Okay.

01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:11.018
One of the best nights of rest you've all gotten

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:13.281
in quite some time, and eventually--

01:11:13.281 --> 01:11:15.558
MARISHA: Beau was up pretty late as well in her room

01:11:15.558 --> 01:11:17.648
just poring through notes.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.343
And meditating on past conversations.
MATT: Okay.

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:22.880
MARISHA: Borderline obsessively.
MATT: Okay.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.878
MARISHA: Before passing out.

01:11:24.878 --> 01:11:25.738
MATT: Book still open.

01:11:25.738 --> 01:11:27.071
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Yeah.

01:11:28.248 --> 01:11:30.658
LAURA: Jester calls a bunch of the cats to her room

01:11:30.658 --> 01:11:33.789
so she can snuggle in a bed full of cats

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:36.518
as she goes to sleep.

01:11:36.518 --> 01:11:38.381
MATT: There's no argument there.

01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:41.988
LAURA and LIAM: (cat chittering)

01:11:41.988 --> 01:11:42.821
MATT: All righty.

01:11:44.148 --> 01:11:45.792
So.

01:11:45.792 --> 01:11:47.498
One by one, you all come to consciousness

01:11:47.498 --> 01:11:49.118
the following morning and make your way down

01:11:49.118 --> 01:11:51.838
for what you assume breakfast

01:11:52.778 --> 01:11:54.808
will be prepared.

01:11:54.808 --> 01:11:58.438
Probably the latest to join would be Beauregard and Caleb.

01:11:58.438 --> 01:12:00.728
But eventually you all do,

01:12:00.728 --> 01:12:04.148
have your meals prepared by a plethora

01:12:04.148 --> 01:12:07.151
of magical fey cats of all sizes.

01:12:08.329 --> 01:12:12.091
It is the greatest of Monster Hunter dreams here.

01:12:14.198 --> 01:12:16.105
What would you like to do?

01:12:17.508 --> 01:12:21.148
TRAVIS: Could I give a small request, critique?

01:12:21.148 --> 01:12:22.939
The hammock was amazing.

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:27.214
Could you make it sway as if I was in a boat?

01:12:27.214 --> 01:12:29.218
It was the only thing that was missing.

01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:30.478
LIAM: Yeah, easy.

01:12:30.478 --> 01:12:35.241
TRAVIS: Thank you. Otherwise, brilliant, brilliant.

01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:40.181
LIAM: So what's step one today?

01:12:42.138 --> 01:12:44.108
Are we bringing your family with us to Zadash?

01:12:44.108 --> 01:12:46.118
SAM: If you have the magic to do it.

01:12:46.118 --> 01:12:47.288
LIAM: I do.

01:12:47.288 --> 01:12:50.128
SAM: Then yes, but I don't want to hold everyone up.

01:12:50.128 --> 01:12:53.528
Maybe-- Do we have to go back to Nicodranas first,

01:12:53.528 --> 01:12:55.731
and then to Zadash, is that how that works?

01:12:57.768 --> 01:13:01.508
LIAM: Oh, they're in Nicodranas still, right?

01:13:01.508 --> 01:13:02.968
SAM: Yes.

01:13:02.968 --> 01:13:06.248
LIAM: Yeah, that's true, so either we need to rely

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:09.171
on the hospitality of Yussa, to use his circle

01:13:09.171 --> 01:13:10.687
and then we can go straight away to Zadash,

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:11.908
because I can take us there,

01:13:11.908 --> 01:13:15.168
or if I take us to your mother's

01:13:15.168 --> 01:13:17.718
or to your house, then we would have to wait a day

01:13:17.718 --> 01:13:19.318
before we could go.

01:13:19.318 --> 01:13:22.591
SAM: Let's go through Yussa and start our journey.

01:13:23.698 --> 01:13:24.618
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's get it.

01:13:24.618 --> 01:13:25.451
LIAM: Keep it quick.

01:13:25.451 --> 01:13:26.528
SAM: Yeah.

01:13:26.528 --> 01:13:29.395
LIAM: Okay. I feel like with the Reserve,

01:13:29.395 --> 01:13:32.568
you can swing your bo staff around,

01:13:32.568 --> 01:13:34.551
but maybe for Yussa, we should--

01:13:34.551 --> 01:13:36.584
Jester, let them know that we're coming.

01:13:37.775 --> 01:13:39.275
LAURA: Oh, yes, I'm going to.

01:13:39.275 --> 01:13:42.138
Sorry, I was looking at my spells.

01:13:42.138 --> 01:13:44.281
Yes, I'm sending a message to Yussa.

01:13:45.978 --> 01:13:48.498
We were just there. Coming back through.

01:13:48.498 --> 01:13:52.728
Don't worry, passing through. Be right out of your hair.

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.248
Okay.

01:13:54.248 --> 01:13:57.758
Also, I've missed you dearly,

01:13:57.758 --> 01:13:59.428
and

01:13:59.428 --> 01:14:03.699
I'm okay with you not--

01:14:03.699 --> 01:14:07.621
(laughter)

01:14:09.068 --> 01:14:13.018
MATT: "Very well, but I would appreciate

01:14:14.378 --> 01:14:17.388
"not turning my living space into

01:14:18.308 --> 01:14:20.833
"a travel nexus."
SAM: We absolutely will.

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:22.507
(laughter)

01:14:22.507 --> 01:14:23.808
MARISHA: Totally.

01:14:23.808 --> 01:14:25.128
SAM: It's happening.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.858
LAURA: He doesn't want us to make his house a travel nexus,

01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:29.148
but the thing that I'm thinking is

01:14:29.148 --> 01:14:31.349
we gave him a Happy Fun Ball, which he's obsessed with.

01:14:31.349 --> 01:14:32.371
MARISHA: Exactly.

01:14:32.371 --> 01:14:34.248
LAURA: I think it's an even trade-off.

01:14:34.248 --> 01:14:38.628
TALIESIN: Have we talked to him about
our current predicament with--

01:14:38.628 --> 01:14:41.908
LAURA: We have mentioned the Eyes of Nine to him, yeah.

01:14:41.908 --> 01:14:42.890
SAM: He didn't have much to say.

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:44.906
TALIESIN: He didn't have much to say yet, okay.

01:14:44.906 --> 01:14:45.976
MATT: He said he'd look into it.

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:52.201
LIAM: Well, maybe he has news less than 24 hours later.

01:14:53.691 --> 01:14:54.591
LAURA: Here we go.

01:14:55.648 --> 01:14:57.358
Oh wait, do we have to leave your house?

01:14:57.358 --> 01:14:59.308
LIAM: We do, we need to go back to our hotel.

01:14:59.308 --> 01:15:00.898
LAURA: Okay, wait, I'm going to--
TRAVIS: Down!

01:15:00.898 --> 01:15:03.508
LAURA: -- pick up one of the little statues

01:15:03.508 --> 01:15:05.788
of the Traveler that I had left,

01:15:05.788 --> 01:15:07.868
and I'm going to sit it in the middle of the floor

01:15:07.868 --> 01:15:11.217
before we leave, just to see if it'll stay.

01:15:11.217 --> 01:15:13.428
ASHLEY: Good idea.
LIAM: Okay. All right, so it's--

01:15:13.428 --> 01:15:16.858
Oh, Mittens, don't clean that up.

01:15:16.858 --> 01:15:20.713
Tell the others we would like it to remain for our return.

01:15:20.713 --> 01:15:23.158
MATT: (meowing)

01:15:23.158 --> 01:15:24.268
LIAM: He is a good boy.

01:15:24.268 --> 01:15:26.141
LAURA: I know; he slept with me last night.

01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:26.974
TRAVIS: A nightmare.

01:15:26.974 --> 01:15:29.218
LAURA: Love you, Mittens.

01:15:29.218 --> 01:15:30.518
TRAVIS: Making my eyes itch.

01:15:30.518 --> 01:15:31.351
MATT: All righty.

01:15:32.578 --> 01:15:34.111
So you all exit the cupboard?

01:15:34.111 --> 01:15:36.038
LIAM: Yes, we will have to descend through the tower,

01:15:36.038 --> 01:15:37.821
down to the entry hole.

01:15:37.821 --> 01:15:39.210
ASHLEY: I feel like you're like actually,

01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.465
just talking about it,
TRAVIS: No, I am.

01:15:40.465 --> 01:15:41.740
LAURA: Just talking about them. (laughs)

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.859
TRAVIS: I'm so allergic to cats.
LIAM: Oh, wow.

01:15:43.859 --> 01:15:45.848
(laughter)

01:15:45.848 --> 01:15:48.978
Don't worry, just going to sleep here every night.

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:50.288
LAURA: No, don't do that.

01:15:50.288 --> 01:15:52.041
SAM: They crawl all over your food.

01:15:53.818 --> 01:15:54.818
ASHLEY: Sleep on your pillow.

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:56.186
MARISHA: One's on your face when you wake up.

01:15:56.186 --> 01:15:57.373
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:15:57.373 --> 01:15:59.407
TRAVIS: That happened. Went to the hospital.

01:15:59.407 --> 01:16:00.248
(wheezing)

01:16:00.248 --> 01:16:02.798
LIAM: When you shave and you reach for a towel, it's a cat.

01:16:04.376 --> 01:16:06.701
SAM: Same with toilet paper.

01:16:06.701 --> 01:16:09.028
TALIESIN: It's not a loofah? Oh!

01:16:09.028 --> 01:16:10.851
MARISHA: "It's not a loofah!" (laughs)

01:16:11.878 --> 01:16:14.148
TRAVIS: (unhappy yowling)

01:16:14.148 --> 01:16:16.538
LIAM: Okay, so if we descend through the tower,

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:19.888
down to the platform, land on that platform, descend down

01:16:19.888 --> 01:16:23.678
the curving brass stairs and then walk to the door.

01:16:23.678 --> 01:16:28.678
Once I open it, we see this small dingy little room.

01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:32.108
LAURA: It actually smells worse than this closet now

01:16:32.108 --> 01:16:33.633
than it did last night.

01:16:35.378 --> 01:16:38.328
LIAM: All right, everybody be good boys!
And I walk out the door.

01:16:39.718 --> 01:16:41.028
MATT: Okay.
SAM: We join.

01:16:41.028 --> 01:16:43.686
MATT: One by one, you all step back into the

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:47.086
extremely meager inn chamber

01:16:47.086 --> 01:16:48.398
that you had rented for the night,

01:16:48.398 --> 01:16:49.231
one of many.

01:16:50.948 --> 01:16:52.222
LIAM: I think on the way out,

01:16:52.222 --> 01:16:54.238
I will pay in advance for the week

01:16:54.238 --> 01:16:57.951
for all nine of the rooms, if they're available.

01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:00.951
MATT: There's no argument there at all.

01:17:00.951 --> 01:17:04.883
She's like, "Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you'd like!

01:17:04.883 --> 01:17:08.976
"That'll be for a week, bulk, up front,

01:17:11.548 --> 01:17:14.996
"we'll say, put it at 10 gold solid."

01:17:14.996 --> 01:17:17.712
LIAM: Easily.
TRAVIS: Don't forget the wardrobe rental fee.

01:17:18.872 --> 01:17:19.705
MATT: "Oh.

01:17:21.418 --> 01:17:23.008
"11 gold."

01:17:23.008 --> 01:17:24.528
LIAM: All right.

01:17:24.528 --> 01:17:26.981
MATT: "I was going to throw it in, but thank you."

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:34.368
LIAM: I meet everybody back upstairs in the room

01:17:34.368 --> 01:17:36.460
and then I start to draw the circle.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:37.805
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.

01:17:37.805 --> 01:17:39.738
LIAM: Aren't we going?
LAURA: Yeah, but where's the dick?

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:43.041
Did it stay in the thing or did it get bamfed out?

01:17:43.918 --> 01:17:44.878
MATT: Have you canceled?

01:17:44.878 --> 01:17:46.058
LIAM: No, I have not done it yet.

01:17:46.058 --> 01:17:47.558
MATT: So nothing yet.

01:17:47.558 --> 01:17:49.338
LIAM: Okay. Well, are we all ready to go?

01:17:49.338 --> 01:17:51.278
Does anyone need to go inside and use the chamber pot,

01:17:51.278 --> 01:17:53.738
or take a bath, or make some tea?

01:17:53.738 --> 01:17:55.038
Okay.

01:17:55.038 --> 01:17:57.128
All right, I drop the spell.

01:17:57.128 --> 01:17:59.048
MATT: All right, as you drop the spell,

01:17:59.048 --> 01:18:03.428
that shimmering vanishes, and you hear (thump),

01:18:03.428 --> 01:18:05.628
and you look, and your statuette

01:18:05.628 --> 01:18:07.908
has been ejected from the space.

01:18:07.908 --> 01:18:09.968
LAURA: We can't leave things there.

01:18:09.968 --> 01:18:12.638
TALIESIN: Well, they don't like implode or anything

01:18:12.638 --> 01:18:13.471
so that's a good sign.

01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:15.348
If you accidentally forget someone in there

01:18:15.348 --> 01:18:16.375
or something like that.

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:19.027
LIAM: It's good that we did not start with Luc,

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:21.260
and see what happens.
SAM: Yes.

01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:24.676
TRAVIS: Ah!
LIAM: He's inside out!

01:18:24.676 --> 01:18:27.299
MATT: Yeah, just like The Fly.

01:18:27.299 --> 01:18:29.383
LAURA: Then it exploded.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.708
LIAM: Okay, so I do start to draw this circle to get us

01:18:34.708 --> 01:18:38.998
to Yussa's tower. Speak now or forever hold your peace.

01:18:38.998 --> 01:18:40.898
TRAVIS: Do it.
LAURA: Let's go.

01:18:40.898 --> 01:18:42.068
MATT: You complete the ritual.

01:18:42.068 --> 01:18:44.168
You watch as the circle of glyphs alights.

01:18:44.168 --> 01:18:46.338
You all rush in one after another and reappear

01:18:46.338 --> 01:18:48.448
in the darkened interior stone chamber

01:18:48.448 --> 01:18:50.108
in the center of Tide Peak Tower.

01:18:50.108 --> 01:18:52.818
There, the door is already open and you see Wensforth,

01:18:52.818 --> 01:18:56.818
the goblin servant of Yussa who's already there waiting,

01:18:56.818 --> 01:18:59.958
and goes, "Ah," and just gestures to the stairs

01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:01.108
that lead further down.

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.248
LIAM: I don't know if this is gauche or not,

01:19:04.248 --> 01:19:07.848
but please accept this. And I hand him two platinum.

01:19:07.848 --> 01:19:12.716
MATT: He takes it. "Not gauche at all!"

01:19:12.716 --> 01:19:13.591
Puts it in his pocket.

01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:15.785
LIAM: Sorry for the consistent trouble.

01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:17.161
MATT: "It doesn't bother me."

01:19:20.318 --> 01:19:21.508
Leads you back to the base area of

01:19:21.508 --> 01:19:22.848
the tower between the furniture

01:19:22.848 --> 01:19:25.318
and the central seating arrangement

01:19:25.318 --> 01:19:28.548
and out into the warm, mid--

01:19:28.548 --> 01:19:31.897
it'd be late morning air, actually--

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:34.228
of the Nicodranas streets.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.698
So the city is yours, what would you like to do?

01:19:36.698 --> 01:19:40.318
SAM: I think, for me, I'm just going to rush back,

01:19:40.318 --> 01:19:43.408
tell Luc and Yeza to pack a quick bag,

01:19:43.408 --> 01:19:45.423
and just get ready to go.

01:19:45.423 --> 01:19:46.802
LAURA: Yeah, we just head on out.

01:19:46.802 --> 01:19:49.015
MATT: Yeah, Yeza is like, "Oh, we're going to--?"

01:19:49.015 --> 01:19:50.565
SAM: Just a quick trip.

01:19:50.565 --> 01:19:52.823
Remember I told you this was a possibility?
MATT: "Right, right."

01:19:52.823 --> 01:19:53.656
SAM: Well, it's happening.

01:19:53.656 --> 01:19:55.986
MATT: "Okay! To Zadash, you said?"

01:19:55.986 --> 01:19:58.678
SAM: To Zadash and points unknown.

01:19:58.678 --> 01:20:01.038
MATT: "Oh wow. Oh, I'm so excited to travel with you

01:20:01.038 --> 01:20:03.028
"and see all this firsthand."

01:20:03.028 --> 01:20:03.936
SAM: Yeah.

01:20:03.936 --> 01:20:05.139
MATT: "Will Luc be okay to come with you?"

01:20:05.139 --> 01:20:06.788
SAM: Yeah, we're not going to do anything dangerous.

01:20:06.788 --> 01:20:08.058
You'll always be safe.

01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:10.478
MATT: "Okay." And Luc goes, "Aww."

01:20:10.478 --> 01:20:13.788
SAM: Well, it's always a little
dangerous whenever you travel.

01:20:13.788 --> 01:20:17.521
MATT: "Okay." Yeza's like, "Hmm."

01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:20.179
(laughter)

01:20:20.179 --> 01:20:21.395
MATT: And starts packing his bag.

01:20:21.395 --> 01:20:22.886
They get their stuff together.

01:20:24.814 --> 01:20:27.165
Yeza gets his bag, and is like, "All right, ready!

01:20:27.165 --> 01:20:29.882
"Luc?" Luc goes-- (cocks crossbow)

01:20:29.882 --> 01:20:31.113
(laughter)

01:20:31.113 --> 01:20:32.838
Yeza's like, "Put that back!"

01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:36.366
MARISHA: Not TSA approved.

01:20:36.366 --> 01:20:37.974
Can't through the portal with that.

01:20:37.974 --> 01:20:38.941
TRAVIS: That'll get you on the list.

01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:41.182
(laughter)

01:20:41.182 --> 01:20:42.640
TRAVIS: (clicks tongue)
SAM: Taliesin.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:43.473
MATT: I know.

01:20:43.473 --> 01:20:45.062
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

01:20:45.062 --> 01:20:47.263
(laughter)

01:20:47.263 --> 01:20:49.512
TRAVIS: Need to confiscate that. Love the show, though.

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:51.848
(laughter)

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:52.926
MATT: That will never not be funny.

01:20:52.926 --> 01:20:54.159
TALIESIN: No, no.

01:20:55.405 --> 01:20:56.317
Never.

01:20:56.317 --> 01:20:57.888
(laughter)

01:20:57.888 --> 01:21:00.178
MATT: You're almost off the list now, right?

01:21:00.178 --> 01:21:01.028
TALIESIN: No.

01:21:01.028 --> 01:21:02.118
MATT: No? Oh, buddy.

01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:03.834
TALIESIN: Another year or two.
MATT: Another year or two? Okay.

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:06.450
(laughter)

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:09.738
MATT: Anyway, you regather yourselves,

01:21:09.738 --> 01:21:12.148
and you are ready for the next leg of your journey.

01:21:12.148 --> 01:21:16.558
LIAM: Okay, so in the courtyard of Veth's home,

01:21:16.558 --> 01:21:18.658
I kneel down. Gather round, gather round,

01:21:18.658 --> 01:21:21.118
I kneel down in front of Luc, and I place my hand

01:21:21.118 --> 01:21:22.675
on his shoulder and I say:

01:21:22.675 --> 01:21:25.875
Luc, what is the fastest you've ever traveled?

01:21:30.178 --> 01:21:33.118
MATT: "We were on a cart once. It went really fast."

01:21:33.118 --> 01:21:33.951
LIAM: Okay.

01:21:33.951 --> 01:21:35.567
MATT: "It got stung in the butt."

01:21:36.788 --> 01:21:38.888
LIAM: That must have smarted.

01:21:38.888 --> 01:21:39.721
MATT: "Maybe."

01:21:40.738 --> 01:21:43.451
LIAM: Do me a favor, and keep your eye on your house.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.852
And I mutter three words and we're gone.

01:21:49.667 --> 01:21:52.328
MATT: As you all emerge

01:21:53.258 --> 01:21:56.968
in the base of the Zadash archive

01:21:56.968 --> 01:22:00.485
of the Cobalt Soul, Luc goes,

01:22:00.485 --> 01:22:01.318
"Whoa!

01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:05.881
"Did we die?"

01:22:05.881 --> 01:22:07.631
(laughter)

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:09.022
SAM: No, no, no.

01:22:09.022 --> 01:22:10.878
No, no, no.

01:22:10.878 --> 01:22:13.218
No, Caleb just magically transported us

01:22:13.218 --> 01:22:14.588
across the continent.

01:22:14.588 --> 01:22:16.967
MATT: "That's so cool!"

01:22:16.967 --> 01:22:19.148
Yeza's like, (groans)

01:22:19.148 --> 01:22:20.211
"Okay, well.

01:22:21.288 --> 01:22:23.847
"Wow. And where are we?"

01:22:23.847 --> 01:22:25.689
MARISHA: Zadash, in the Cobalt Soul.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:29.897
MATT: "That's really well done, I'm impressed."

01:22:29.897 --> 01:22:31.668
SAM: Do they have a children's section here?

01:22:31.668 --> 01:22:33.378
MARISHA: Yeah, of course they do.

01:22:33.378 --> 01:22:36.848
You should see some of the Zemnian fairytales;

01:22:36.848 --> 01:22:37.797
they're bananas.

01:22:37.797 --> 01:22:39.438
(laughter)

01:22:39.438 --> 01:22:42.168
SAM: Check out a few books on the way out.

01:22:42.168 --> 01:22:44.088
LIAM: That'll put some hair on the boy's chin.

01:22:44.088 --> 01:22:44.921
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:22:46.398 --> 01:22:48.598
MATT: There's a brief bit of confusion

01:22:48.598 --> 01:22:51.603
as there was no forewarning necessarily of the arrival.

01:22:51.603 --> 01:22:54.115
MARISHA: Ah, shit. Sorry, guys.

01:22:54.115 --> 01:22:57.758
MATT: And you envision there's somewhere in the file

01:22:57.758 --> 01:23:00.968
about Beauregard Lionett, there's this long series

01:23:00.968 --> 01:23:04.568
of write-ups for each time this happens.

01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:07.971
They're minor, but they add up over time, but you're fine.

01:23:09.228 --> 01:23:11.078
MARISHA: Wait, where is that infraction list?

01:23:11.078 --> 01:23:13.129
MATT: Oh, you imagine it's somewhere.
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

01:23:13.129 --> 01:23:14.355
MATT: You don't see it, they don't have, like,

01:23:14.355 --> 01:23:15.768
"Hey, look at your infraction list!"

01:23:15.768 --> 01:23:18.238
MARISHA: On the board, yeah. (laughs)

01:23:18.238 --> 01:23:20.129
TRAVIS: A bunch of names, and one long-ass line.

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:23.271
MATT: Yeah. It's been 10-- zero days since

01:23:23.271 --> 01:23:25.087
Beauregard arrived unannounced.

01:23:25.087 --> 01:23:27.712
(laughter)

01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:31.728
LIAM: Another Lionett surprise inspection.

01:23:31.728 --> 01:23:35.268
MATT: Exactly, but you do emerge back in the familiar,

01:23:35.268 --> 01:23:39.282
somewhat gray Zemnian skies over Zadash.

01:23:39.282 --> 01:23:42.182
A city that you haven't really been to in
quite a bit of time.

01:23:43.408 --> 01:23:46.388
It is a village that is familiar to both Luc and Yeza,

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:47.833
though they haven't traveled here in quite some time,

01:23:47.833 --> 01:23:49.067
they spent some time in Felderwin,

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:51.271
but it's close enough to home where there is

01:23:52.478 --> 01:23:53.448
a bit of a smile.

01:23:53.448 --> 01:23:54.706
As much as they've enjoyed Nicodranas,

01:23:54.706 --> 01:23:55.918
you get the air that it is nice to have

01:23:55.918 --> 01:23:58.071
some semblance of home for a bit.

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:01.078
But you arrive here in Zadash.

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:02.371
Where are you off to?

01:24:05.341 --> 01:24:07.560
LAURA: Should we go to Pumat's?

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.118
SAM: We should go Pumat's.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:24:09.118 --> 01:24:11.648
LAURA: Oh, I bet Luc would love Pumat's place!

01:24:11.648 --> 01:24:12.718
SAM: Sure.

01:24:12.718 --> 01:24:13.688
MARISHA: You guys go ahead,

01:24:13.688 --> 01:24:16.361
I'm going to stay here and ask a few more questions.

01:24:18.694 --> 01:24:19.527
What?

01:24:19.527 --> 01:24:22.008
LAURA: (whispering) About the Eyes of Nine?

01:24:22.008 --> 01:24:25.788
MARISHA: Yeah, I think I've been
using the wrong words.

01:24:25.788 --> 01:24:29.168
I think I know what to ask about.

01:24:29.168 --> 01:24:33.158
So. I'll fill you in in a second.

01:24:33.158 --> 01:24:35.108
Let me ask some questions to make sure I'm sure.

01:24:35.108 --> 01:24:39.331
SAM: If they don't have anything, my theory stands.

01:24:40.358 --> 01:24:44.981
Just find out who has access to the inventory.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:47.481
MARISHA: Well, I asked about that.

01:24:48.528 --> 01:24:49.861
You're talking about the--

01:24:49.861 --> 01:24:51.344
SAM: Well, if someone scrubbed

01:24:51.344 --> 01:24:52.848
the library of these books.

01:24:52.848 --> 01:24:54.478
MARISHA: I have some thoughts.
SAM: Okay, okay.

01:24:54.478 --> 01:24:55.331
MARISHA: I'll follow up.

01:24:57.398 --> 01:24:59.113
TRAVIS: I have some thoughts.

01:24:59.113 --> 01:25:00.196
MARISHA: Some thoughts, yeah. (laughter)

01:25:00.196 --> 01:25:02.188
LIAM: May I assist you?

01:25:02.188 --> 01:25:05.148
MARISHA: Sure. Yasha, You want to stay here, or

01:25:05.148 --> 01:25:06.648
you want to check in on Pumat?

01:25:07.548 --> 01:25:08.581
ASHLEY: Kind of want to stay.

01:25:09.428 --> 01:25:11.798
MARISHA: I kind of want to compare notes.

01:25:11.798 --> 01:25:12.631
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:12.631 --> 01:25:15.275
MARISHA: You knew Molly better than anybody, and I think--

01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:19.073
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'd like to help.
MARISHA: I think he was wrapped up in some shit.

01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:20.308
ASHLEY: I would love to help.

01:25:20.308 --> 01:25:21.528
LIAM: Jester, would you do me a favor?

01:25:21.528 --> 01:25:24.985
If there was anything interesting at Pumat's

01:25:24.985 --> 01:25:26.398
that you think is up my alley,

01:25:26.398 --> 01:25:27.733
would you let me know about it?

01:25:27.733 --> 01:25:29.698
LAURA: Of course. I can send you a message.

01:25:29.698 --> 01:25:30.968
Do you want to just give me some money

01:25:30.968 --> 01:25:32.316
so I can buy it for you?

01:25:32.316 --> 01:25:34.174
LIAM: I give Jester all my money.

01:25:35.368 --> 01:25:36.659
SAM: It's like 50 gold.

01:25:36.659 --> 01:25:38.250
LIAM: It's more than 50 gold.

01:25:39.409 --> 01:25:41.388
TALIESIN: 50 gold, 10 silver.

01:25:41.388 --> 01:25:43.081
LIAM: It is 183 platinum.

01:25:46.328 --> 01:25:48.308
You don't have to spend it, but, you know,

01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:49.758
if the right--

01:25:49.758 --> 01:25:52.951
LAURA: If I see any really cool paper?
LIAM: -- thing comes along

01:25:52.951 --> 01:25:55.748
LIAM: I'm good with paper for now.

01:25:55.748 --> 01:25:57.768
I mean something unique.

01:25:57.768 --> 01:25:58.838
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Okay.

01:26:01.234 --> 01:26:02.067
MATT: Okay.

01:26:03.048 --> 01:26:05.803
So you both are staying.

01:26:05.803 --> 01:26:07.358
Yasha, you're staying as well, or are you going?

01:26:07.358 --> 01:26:08.191
MARISHA: Us three.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:26:08.191 --> 01:26:10.268
MATT: The three of you are staying, all right.

01:26:10.268 --> 01:26:13.008
After the rest of the group leaves out and you begin

01:26:13.008 --> 01:26:15.758
asking around, getting some questions.

01:26:15.758 --> 01:26:18.686
You hear a familiar voice go,

01:26:18.686 --> 01:26:19.986
"(throat clear)"

01:26:20.878 --> 01:26:22.888
MARISHA: Is it Dairon? Or is it Zeenoth?

01:26:22.888 --> 01:26:24.267
MATT: No, it's Zeenoth.

01:26:24.267 --> 01:26:25.898
MARISHA: Ah.

01:26:25.898 --> 01:26:26.983
Zeenoth.

01:26:28.008 --> 01:26:31.704
MATT: "Expositor Beauregard. It has been some time."

01:26:31.704 --> 01:26:32.798
MARISHA: It has.

01:26:32.798 --> 01:26:34.183
MATT: "I've heard you arrived unannounced

01:26:34.183 --> 01:26:35.318
"but a short time ago.

01:26:35.318 --> 01:26:37.268
"Well, happy to have you again."

01:26:37.268 --> 01:26:39.921
MARISHA: Yep. Like always, unannounced.

01:26:40.968 --> 01:26:44.468
MATT: "Well, do you need anything?"

01:26:44.468 --> 01:26:47.615
MARISHA: I do. A lot of stuff.

01:26:47.615 --> 01:26:49.258
MATT: "All right."

01:26:49.258 --> 01:26:51.198
MARISHA: I start opening up all my notebooks,

01:26:51.198 --> 01:26:52.198
MATT: "Oh! Ah..."

01:26:52.198 --> 01:26:54.314
MARISHA: -- slamming them down.

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:57.671
MATT: He's like, "Ah, right.

01:26:59.698 --> 01:27:02.098
"So our resources are yours. Of course."

01:27:02.098 --> 01:27:03.403
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: "Expositor."

01:27:03.403 --> 01:27:06.708
MARISHA: I need you to find anything about the Eyes of Nine,

01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:08.638
but you're probably not going to find anything about that.

01:27:08.638 --> 01:27:13.398
So I need you to research a surname of Nonagon,

01:27:13.398 --> 01:27:15.488
and maybe a cult wrapped around that.

01:27:15.488 --> 01:27:18.948
Maybe it's a cult named Nonagon.

01:27:18.948 --> 01:27:20.956
And then also if we have any records of a group

01:27:20.956 --> 01:27:22.955
named the Tomb Takers?

01:27:22.955 --> 01:27:24.448
MATT: "All right, well--"

01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:27.351
MARISHA: -- and you might come across someone's name,

01:27:28.218 --> 01:27:30.685
Lucien Nonagon.

01:27:30.685 --> 01:27:32.599
Any records.--
MATT: "All right."

01:27:32.599 --> 01:27:34.052
MARISHA: -- we have around Lucien, but I think

01:27:34.052 --> 01:27:36.818
you just should start with the Nonagon thing.

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:40.168
MATT: "Okay, well, there was--

01:27:40.168 --> 01:27:42.426
"the Herald Yudala Fon did put in a request

01:27:42.426 --> 01:27:45.248
"but a day ago to look into this Eyes of Nine

01:27:45.248 --> 01:27:47.558
"across all of the archives.

01:27:47.558 --> 01:27:49.395
"So, that has been--

01:27:49.395 --> 01:27:51.658
"it was in the process of research."

01:27:51.658 --> 01:27:52.728
MARISHA: Anything?

01:27:52.728 --> 01:27:55.229
MATT: "Nothing yet that I know of."
MARISHA: (sighs) You're useless, Zeenoth.

01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:57.795
(laughter)

01:27:57.795 --> 01:27:59.228
MARISHA: All right, what else?

01:27:59.228 --> 01:28:01.738
MATT: "We'll look into the other items for the moment."

01:28:01.738 --> 01:28:02.571
MARISHA: Okay.

01:28:04.508 --> 01:28:05.648
MATT: "Anything else you require?"

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:07.408
MARISHA: Do you need help with that?

01:28:07.408 --> 01:28:09.768
MATT: "You're welcome to research if you'd like,

01:28:09.768 --> 01:28:12.178
"but you seemed like you were giving orders,

01:28:12.178 --> 01:28:16.018
"as opposed to asking for aid."

01:28:16.018 --> 01:28:17.128
MARISHA: Pull some books.

01:28:17.128 --> 01:28:19.391
We're going to take an hour or so.

01:28:20.258 --> 01:28:21.685
MATT: "All right. Well--"

01:28:21.685 --> 01:28:23.591
MARISHA: We'll meet you in the main study.

01:28:24.568 --> 01:28:26.276
MATT: "We'll make some space."
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:28:26.276 --> 01:28:27.518
MATT: "Of course."

01:28:27.518 --> 01:28:28.488
MARISHA: Good seeing you.

01:28:28.488 --> 01:28:29.638
MATT: "Good seeing you, too,"

01:28:30.668 --> 01:28:34.328
and he wanders off to gather a few other archivists

01:28:34.328 --> 01:28:37.378
to begin pulling tomes and books that seem to--

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:40.178
that could possibly correlate to what you're requesting.

01:28:41.048 --> 01:28:41.881
All right.

01:28:41.881 --> 01:28:43.608
So the three of you are doing some research

01:28:43.608 --> 01:28:45.949
while you're here.

01:28:45.949 --> 01:28:47.924
Who is helming to research what,

01:28:47.924 --> 01:28:50.038
or who wants to begin their research?

01:28:50.038 --> 01:28:51.808
LIAM: You are the detective. I will assist you.

01:28:51.808 --> 01:28:54.185
MATT: So what specifically are you looking into, Beauregard?

01:28:54.185 --> 01:28:57.201
MARISHA: I want to see if there's any records of a cult,

01:28:58.578 --> 01:29:02.128
or some sort of order that's related to Nonagon.

01:29:02.128 --> 01:29:04.167
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check for me.

01:29:04.167 --> 01:29:05.000
MARISHA: All right.

01:29:06.988 --> 01:29:10.572
With a little assisties?

01:29:10.572 --> 01:29:11.468
MATT: If you'd like to.

01:29:11.468 --> 01:29:12.408
LIAM: Yes.

01:29:12.408 --> 01:29:13.930
MARISHA: Okay. You said investigation, Matt?

01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:14.763
MATT: Yes.

01:29:16.548 --> 01:29:17.381
MARISHA: Okay.

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:19.878
25.
MATT: 25.

01:29:19.878 --> 01:29:21.368
Okay.

01:29:21.368 --> 01:29:22.455
MARISHA: Not too bad.

01:29:22.455 --> 01:29:24.934
MATT: I mean the term "nonagon" is a

01:29:26.648 --> 01:29:30.368
reference to some sort of a nine-sided shape.

01:29:30.368 --> 01:29:34.381
Whether it be walls or geometric design. You find that,

01:29:35.968 --> 01:29:38.608
but there's nothing in particular

01:29:39.508 --> 01:29:44.258
about any individual or a historical record

01:29:44.258 --> 01:29:47.008
of anything beyond that particular usage that you find.

01:29:48.458 --> 01:29:50.688
MARISHA: Anything about the Tomb Takers?

01:29:50.688 --> 01:29:52.238
MATT: Do you want to check on that as well?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:29:52.238 --> 01:29:54.328
MATT: Go ahead and make a roll there.

01:29:54.328 --> 01:29:55.161
MARISHA: Same.

01:29:57.758 --> 01:29:58.918
LIAM: We're just bringing you books

01:29:58.918 --> 01:30:00.684
and finding passages that are relevant.

01:30:00.684 --> 01:30:02.016
MARISHA: My god, thank god you're assisting me:

01:30:02.016 --> 01:30:04.278
one of those was a natural one.

01:30:04.278 --> 01:30:05.269
19.

01:30:05.269 --> 01:30:06.358
MATT: 19.

01:30:06.358 --> 01:30:09.663
There is a vague reference to a Tomb Takers,

01:30:09.663 --> 01:30:13.038
or a group that has a title similar to that

01:30:14.238 --> 01:30:16.278
out of Shadycreek Run.

01:30:16.278 --> 01:30:17.111
MARISHA: Okay.

01:30:18.847 --> 01:30:22.148
MATT: Seemed to be active for roughly four to five years,

01:30:22.148 --> 01:30:24.488
MARISHA: Four to five years? Okay.

01:30:24.488 --> 01:30:27.239
MATT: But hasn't been active for--

01:30:27.239 --> 01:30:29.614
MARISHA: Two years?
MATT: About two years. So.

01:30:33.118 --> 01:30:34.978
Of all the notes that you find that compiling on it,

01:30:34.978 --> 01:30:35.811
it's loose notes.

01:30:35.811 --> 01:30:37.868
It's more individuals have just kept note of it,

01:30:37.868 --> 01:30:40.328
they haven't done anything of significance to really catch

01:30:40.328 --> 01:30:42.524
any detailed archivist's interest

01:30:42.524 --> 01:30:45.206
to keep cataloging anything beyond

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:48.398
that they existed, the kind of work they did,

01:30:48.398 --> 01:30:50.808
and the general demeanor seemed to be--

01:30:50.808 --> 01:30:52.918
MARISHA: What kind of work did they do?

01:30:52.918 --> 01:30:55.145
MATT: Mercenary work of whatever was necessary.

01:30:57.401 --> 01:31:01.847
A lot of it was just acquisitions of things

01:31:01.847 --> 01:31:06.818
needed unlawfully, some thieving, some bodyguarding.

01:31:08.428 --> 01:31:12.648
They were hired a number of expeditions into the ruins

01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:16.075
of Molaesmyr, into some other--

01:31:18.508 --> 01:31:20.318
MARISHA: Any records of who they worked for,

01:31:20.318 --> 01:31:22.018
of who contracted them?

01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:25.262
MATT: No, the only people who would
keep records of that would be them.

01:31:25.262 --> 01:31:26.908
And most of what's recorded here is recorded

01:31:26.908 --> 01:31:29.388
through hearsay, or through inquiring

01:31:29.388 --> 01:31:31.788
and paying individuals for information they had.

01:31:32.778 --> 01:31:35.168
But since they worked largely out of Shadycreek Run,

01:31:35.168 --> 01:31:40.168
and the archive has absolutely no power there,

01:31:40.398 --> 01:31:43.381
what information they do have here is pretty scattershot.

01:31:49.751 --> 01:31:52.584
MARISHA: I think Vess DeRogna hired them.

01:31:56.078 --> 01:31:58.828
I just know they did.

01:31:58.828 --> 01:32:01.358
LIAM: She fits the description.

01:32:01.358 --> 01:32:03.008
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:32:03.008 --> 01:32:07.158
I think he got wrapped up in whatever she wants,

01:32:07.158 --> 01:32:10.199
whatever her goals are. And I think Molly--

01:32:11.082 --> 01:32:12.598
I don't know.

01:32:12.598 --> 01:32:14.947
I think he got looped into something weird.

01:32:14.947 --> 01:32:17.838
LIAM: Yeah. Maybe the question is,

01:32:17.838 --> 01:32:22.098
is she solely in this arms race, as it were,

01:32:22.098 --> 01:32:23.953
with the Dynasty to see what

01:32:26.378 --> 01:32:28.888
power or artifacts are hidden there,

01:32:28.888 --> 01:32:31.963
or does she have some sort of longer term goal

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:33.678
that she is not discussing with us?

01:32:34.598 --> 01:32:35.431
MARISHA: Yes.

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:37.484
I think both.

01:32:40.748 --> 01:32:42.828
LIAM: How do we broach it? Straight on?

01:32:42.828 --> 01:32:45.385
Or do we try to suss it out?

01:32:52.728 --> 01:32:56.141
ASHLEY: Thinking of something that-- (sighs)

01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:59.818
I don't know if I'm crazy,

01:32:59.818 --> 01:33:01.546
or if this was a thing, but

01:33:02.662 --> 01:33:04.534
remember when we saw--

01:33:07.768 --> 01:33:09.668
I think we were talking to Cree

01:33:09.668 --> 01:33:11.511
because my notes are kind of weird.

01:33:16.829 --> 01:33:20.078
Something with that ritual. I feel like she said,

01:33:20.078 --> 01:33:24.958
or somebody said that he was trying to reach the city?

01:33:24.958 --> 01:33:26.678
MARISHA: Yes, yes!

01:33:26.678 --> 01:33:29.388
So, and then what I have in my notes,

01:33:29.388 --> 01:33:32.888
and I start frantically pointing at my notes-- Yasha,

01:33:32.888 --> 01:33:36.878
that the ritual, it went wrong.

01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:39.368
It went really bad

01:33:39.368 --> 01:33:42.218
and Lucien instructed them

01:33:42.218 --> 01:33:44.211
to scatter if anything went wrong.

01:33:45.718 --> 01:33:49.158
And then I remember her mentioning

01:33:50.118 --> 01:33:51.661
something about,

01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:57.071
(laughs) Hang on!

01:34:00.225 --> 01:34:02.948
(laughter)

01:34:02.948 --> 01:34:04.218
LAURA: Keep going, keep going. It's good.

01:34:04.218 --> 01:34:05.383
LIAM: You're doing great.

01:34:06.678 --> 01:34:07.811
MARISHA: Shit, shit.

01:34:08.778 --> 01:34:10.411
I lost my train of thought. Oh.

01:34:11.428 --> 01:34:13.768
LIAM: Everyone was going to scatter if things went wrong,

01:34:13.768 --> 01:34:14.938
things went wrong.

01:34:14.938 --> 01:34:16.078
MARISHA: Things went bad,

01:34:16.078 --> 01:34:20.801
and that they were running from a spellslinger from--

01:34:23.477 --> 01:34:25.575
hang on-- from the capital--
SAM: Ooh.

01:34:27.278 --> 01:34:29.136
MARISHA: -- who wanted the book.

01:34:29.136 --> 01:34:30.328
SAM: What book?

01:34:30.328 --> 01:34:32.836
MARISHA: They had a book, some sort of ritual.

01:34:32.836 --> 01:34:34.247
Right, you're not there.

01:34:34.247 --> 01:34:36.738
ASHLEY: That was probably what they used for the ritual?

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:37.688
MARISHA: The ritual. Yes.

01:34:37.688 --> 01:34:39.221
Whatever ritual book,

01:34:40.428 --> 01:34:41.864
it went wrong.

01:34:41.864 --> 01:34:44.006
TRAVIS: These two motherfuckers right here.

01:34:45.944 --> 01:34:48.138
MARISHA: And she was coming after them,

01:34:48.138 --> 01:34:51.398
Then they ran from it, whatever it was,

01:34:51.398 --> 01:34:53.048
they were talking about running from a book.

01:34:53.048 --> 01:34:56.301
And then Molly said something about,

01:34:57.905 --> 01:34:59.851
"You don't want to mess with that book.

01:35:01.865 --> 01:35:03.688
"It only brought me trouble."

01:35:03.688 --> 01:35:07.208
And he was trying to dissuade Cree from reaching out

01:35:07.208 --> 01:35:09.641
to all of their former contacts,

01:35:11.008 --> 01:35:12.455
because Cree was also like,

01:35:12.455 --> 01:35:14.998
"Oh, we can reach out to all of our old buddies."

01:35:14.998 --> 01:35:16.368
And Molly was like, "Nah."

01:35:16.368 --> 01:35:17.528
because Molly didn't want anything to do

01:35:17.528 --> 01:35:18.628
with any of that shit.

01:35:20.358 --> 01:35:23.588
LIAM: DM, last game, did Jester try to

01:35:23.588 --> 01:35:25.398
contact Cree and got no answer, am I remembering?

01:35:25.398 --> 01:35:26.798
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Oh, I got an answer.

01:35:26.798 --> 01:35:29.918
MATT: Well, no. You tried to contact The Gentlemen.

01:35:29.918 --> 01:35:31.238
LIAM: The Gentleman?
MARISHA: We contacted Cree.

01:35:31.238 --> 01:35:32.394
MATT: Oh no, you did. you contacted Cree,

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:33.469
and there was no response.

01:35:33.469 --> 01:35:37.258
LAURA: Cree responded saying, "Fuck off," basically.

01:35:37.258 --> 01:35:38.358
MATT: Right.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:35:40.558 --> 01:35:44.598
So it took me a while to figure out what my notes were,

01:35:44.598 --> 01:35:46.508
because I had to really think about it.

01:35:46.508 --> 01:35:51.258
But Cree also mentioned someone named Tyffial in Nogvurot.

01:35:51.258 --> 01:35:52.761
who was a part of their order.

01:35:54.998 --> 01:35:56.518
I don't think

01:35:57.658 --> 01:36:00.441
Molly, if we try to talk to Molly,

01:36:01.428 --> 01:36:04.888
a dead shadow of our fucking friend,

01:36:04.888 --> 01:36:07.028
I don't think we're going to get much more from him

01:36:07.028 --> 01:36:09.458
than what he didn't already tell us when he was alive.

01:36:09.458 --> 01:36:11.848
I still think we try and track down

01:36:11.848 --> 01:36:13.108
some of these Tomb Takers.

01:36:13.108 --> 01:36:16.081
LIAM: Well, that's an interesting question,

01:36:17.588 --> 01:36:19.198
asking Molly what he knows,

01:36:19.198 --> 01:36:22.901
because, according to Molly, he was dead more than once,

01:36:24.108 --> 01:36:28.638
so who knows who inhabits the home of a dead man's skull

01:36:28.638 --> 01:36:31.298
when there have been several personalities in there.

01:36:31.298 --> 01:36:33.568
It might not be pointless,

01:36:33.568 --> 01:36:37.182
but I-- that's a question for Caduceus, maybe.

01:36:37.182 --> 01:36:38.910
Or Taliesin.

01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:40.611
ASHLEY: You know, you know--

01:36:41.748 --> 01:36:43.178
sorry, I'm piecing things together,

01:36:43.178 --> 01:36:44.436
and it's--

01:36:44.436 --> 01:36:46.585
MARISHA: It comes back to you

01:36:46.585 --> 01:36:48.648
but in waves,

01:36:48.648 --> 01:36:49.598
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's coming in waves.

01:36:49.598 --> 01:36:53.188
I think two things that I'm thinking of.

01:36:53.188 --> 01:36:56.001
I don't know if this has anything to do with anything, but

01:37:00.887 --> 01:37:03.304
I remember when--

01:37:06.638 --> 01:37:08.498
I mean, I wasn't there when Molly showed up

01:37:08.498 --> 01:37:10.821
to the circus because he was there before me,

01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:16.668
but the reason he came to the group,

01:37:16.668 --> 01:37:18.058
and he kept--

01:37:18.058 --> 01:37:20.451
apparently kept saying he felt empty,

01:37:21.728 --> 01:37:23.955
empty, empty, empty,

01:37:23.955 --> 01:37:27.701
and then "MT" turned into his name:

01:37:29.038 --> 01:37:29.871
Mollymauk

01:37:32.108 --> 01:37:32.941
Tealeaf.

01:37:37.162 --> 01:37:38.479
I feel like,

01:37:40.018 --> 01:37:40.851
what if

01:37:42.933 --> 01:37:44.008
Gustav,

01:37:44.008 --> 01:37:46.831
who was the head of the circus,

01:37:47.677 --> 01:37:50.918
I think he's from Shadycreek Run.

01:37:50.918 --> 01:37:54.048
So maybe he's somebody else we could try to talk to?

01:37:54.048 --> 01:37:59.048
I don't know, that maybe has-- he knew Molly before I did.

01:38:01.338 --> 01:38:03.728
So maybe that could be a connection of something?

01:38:03.728 --> 01:38:04.781
MARISHA: He owes us.

01:38:09.728 --> 01:38:11.770
LIAM: No doubt Molly was involved with

01:38:12.927 --> 01:38:15.869
a very complicated patchwork of people.

01:38:16.758 --> 01:38:17.968
There are threads you're pulling at.

01:38:17.968 --> 01:38:20.948
How that connects to what we are researching now

01:38:20.948 --> 01:38:21.781
is hard to tell.

01:38:21.781 --> 01:38:22.828
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

01:38:22.828 --> 01:38:24.588
So do you want me to go into this now?

01:38:24.588 --> 01:38:25.828
Or should I gather the others?

01:38:25.828 --> 01:38:26.988
LIAM: You should gather the others.

01:38:26.988 --> 01:38:27.938
MARISHA: Let's gather the others.

01:38:27.938 --> 01:38:28.828
ASHLEY: They might have some information.

01:38:28.828 --> 01:38:29.928
LIAM: The last thing you want to do

01:38:29.928 --> 01:38:32.518
is tell a very intricate, important story--

01:38:32.518 --> 01:38:36.128
MARISHA: And then have to retell it, I know, I know.

01:38:36.128 --> 01:38:38.968
I rip out the page documenting the Tomb Takers.

01:38:38.968 --> 01:38:39.968
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:38:39.968 --> 01:38:40.858
MARISHA: I shove it in my bag.

01:38:40.858 --> 01:38:42.978
LIAM: I could have memorized that poor book.

01:38:42.978 --> 01:38:43.861
MARISHA: No time!

01:38:43.861 --> 01:38:45.278
(laughter)

01:38:45.278 --> 01:38:46.528
ASHLEY: She's allowed to do it.

01:38:47.728 --> 01:38:51.098
LIAM: Caleb just goes thousand-yard stare
for a full 30 seconds,

01:38:51.098 --> 01:38:52.895
TRAVIS: You massacred a book!

01:38:55.168 --> 01:38:56.559
MATT: Like a slight twitch in the left eye.

01:38:56.559 --> 01:38:58.079
TRAVIS: ♪ Who can say ♪

01:38:58.079 --> 01:39:00.095
MARISHA: Zeenoth.
MATT: "Yes?"

01:39:00.095 --> 01:39:04.138
MARISHA: You let me know if you find anything, okay?

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:06.614
MATT: "Don't worry, we'll let you know as soon as possible.

01:39:06.614 --> 01:39:08.161
"It did come from upon high."

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:09.901
MARISHA: Let's go.

01:39:11.648 --> 01:39:13.918
MATT: All right. You guys head off
to meet up with the others.

01:39:13.918 --> 01:39:15.298
You've been there for quite a while.

01:39:15.298 --> 01:39:17.306
This has taken a few hours to research.

01:39:17.306 --> 01:39:19.386
LIAM: Bringing Beauregard stacks of books,

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:21.448
scanning ahead for her, showing her passages

01:39:21.448 --> 01:39:24.058
along what she was looking for.

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:25.258
MATT: Exactly.

01:39:25.258 --> 01:39:30.214
Meanwhile, the rest of you make your way to the Pentamarket.

01:39:30.214 --> 01:39:33.568
The familiar sounds and smells of all the various

01:39:33.568 --> 01:39:38.198
street side shops and carts and bits of music and barkers.

01:39:38.198 --> 01:39:40.289
And it's just as lively as you remember here.

01:39:40.289 --> 01:39:42.128
In a post-wartime scenario,

01:39:42.128 --> 01:39:46.028
it seems that everyone's actively leaping into

01:39:46.028 --> 01:39:50.293
the positive energy of the peace that has come upon,

01:39:50.293 --> 01:39:52.368
seemingly for the time being at least,

01:39:52.368 --> 01:39:53.618
the Dwendalian Empire.

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:57.918
You see the familiar sight of the dark green and gold

01:39:57.918 --> 01:40:02.108
painted abode that is The Invulnerable Vagrant.

01:40:02.108 --> 01:40:05.598
As you approach and open the door, you see it's not busy.

01:40:05.598 --> 01:40:07.463
There's no other customers in there.

01:40:07.463 --> 01:40:09.179
It looks

01:40:10.698 --> 01:40:12.892
maybe a little less empty than it did

01:40:12.892 --> 01:40:14.708
the last time you visited. It's, you know,

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:16.788
a lot of the materials, magical items have been

01:40:16.788 --> 01:40:21.398
conscripted for the army's use by the Cerberus Assembly,

01:40:21.398 --> 01:40:23.888
it looks like he's slowly either re-acquiring,

01:40:23.888 --> 01:40:27.208
or has been creating in the interim.

01:40:27.208 --> 01:40:31.298
But as you enter and look about and see the few elements of

01:40:31.298 --> 01:40:34.798
restocking that is slowly making its way back to the

01:40:34.798 --> 01:40:36.178
brilliance of the previous

01:40:37.378 --> 01:40:39.818
Invulnerable Vagrant's presentation,

01:40:39.818 --> 01:40:41.985
you hear that familiar voice go,

01:40:41.985 --> 01:40:44.408
"All right, welcome to The Invulnerable Vagrant.

01:40:44.408 --> 01:40:47.418
"I just-- Oh my goodness! Look at--

01:40:47.418 --> 01:40:49.418
"There's a fine bunch of friends

01:40:49.418 --> 01:40:51.711
"who are coming in to hello.

01:40:53.215 --> 01:40:56.308
"Respectfully, I am just completely elated

01:40:56.308 --> 01:40:58.738
"to see your faces."

01:40:58.738 --> 01:40:59.868
LAURA: How are you, Pumat?

01:40:59.868 --> 01:41:02.768
MATT: "Well, much better now looking upon

01:41:02.768 --> 01:41:06.068
"your fantastic blue visage."

01:41:06.068 --> 01:41:08.630
(laughter)

01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:09.917
LAURA: We've missed you!

01:41:09.917 --> 01:41:12.397
MATT: "Well, golly, you're just going to

01:41:12.397 --> 01:41:15.118
"make me turn bright purple."

01:41:15.118 --> 01:41:17.188
TALIESIN: It's good to see a friendly face again.

01:41:17.188 --> 01:41:19.228
MATT: "You as well, pal!"

01:41:19.228 --> 01:41:21.248
TALIESIN: How's peacetime treating you?

01:41:21.248 --> 01:41:22.926
MATT: "Well, much better now!

01:41:22.926 --> 01:41:25.968
"Putting together a few ideas of my own.

01:41:25.968 --> 01:41:28.158
"I've been trying to, you know,

01:41:28.158 --> 01:41:31.198
"piecemeal some more enchantments.

01:41:31.198 --> 01:41:33.531
"Because it's kind of what I do."

01:41:35.608 --> 01:41:36.838
LAURA: Let's see what it is!

01:41:36.838 --> 01:41:38.666
SAM: Yeah, what you're working on?

01:41:38.666 --> 01:41:41.748
We are flush with cash and ready to spend.

01:41:41.748 --> 01:41:44.018
In addition to spend time with you.

01:41:44.018 --> 01:41:48.129
I regret to inform you, we don't have any basilisk oil yet,

01:41:48.129 --> 01:41:50.401
as we haven't encountered any basilisks.

01:41:50.401 --> 01:41:53.458
MATT: "And that's completely fine. By the way, I'm sorry,

01:41:53.458 --> 01:41:55.958
"I don't think we've made our acquaintances yet.

01:41:55.958 --> 01:41:58.318
"My name's Pumat Sol."

01:41:58.318 --> 01:42:01.301
SAM: Oh, hi. You do know me.

01:42:03.681 --> 01:42:05.438
I was Nott,

01:42:05.438 --> 01:42:08.923
but now I am Veth.

01:42:08.923 --> 01:42:10.538
I was Nott, but now I'm Veth.

01:42:10.538 --> 01:42:13.384
TRAVIS: This face. And I make Nott's face. (yells)

01:42:13.384 --> 01:42:14.617
MATT: "(yells)"

01:42:14.617 --> 01:42:15.984
(laughter)

01:42:15.984 --> 01:42:20.276
MATT: "Oh, well, Veth, it's an absolute pleasure

01:42:21.331 --> 01:42:22.478
"to re-meet you,

01:42:22.478 --> 01:42:25.208
"and the right version."

01:42:25.208 --> 01:42:26.418
SAM: Yeah, exactly.

01:42:26.418 --> 01:42:28.298
And this is, well,

01:42:28.298 --> 01:42:30.808
this is my, this is Caleb.

01:42:30.808 --> 01:42:33.018
Caleb has turned into this man,

01:42:33.018 --> 01:42:35.631
and this little one over here, used to be Yasha.

01:42:36.728 --> 01:42:38.975
No, I'm I'm just fucking with you.

01:42:38.975 --> 01:42:42.908
MATT: "I was about to say,
I missed out on a lot of information.

01:42:42.908 --> 01:42:45.598
SAM: This is my husband Yeza and my son, Luc.

01:42:45.598 --> 01:42:47.727
And this is his first time here.

01:42:47.727 --> 01:42:51.495
MATT: Luc is already up on the counter, like, "Whoa!

01:42:51.495 --> 01:42:52.928
"There's four of him!"

01:42:52.928 --> 01:42:54.282
You can see the other ones are

01:42:54.282 --> 01:42:55.315
peeking around the corner.

01:42:55.315 --> 01:42:56.148
"Hey!"

01:42:57.125 --> 01:42:58.357
"Hey."

01:42:58.357 --> 01:43:01.566
Around the corner. (footsteps) "Oh! Hey!"

01:43:03.688 --> 01:43:04.768
LAURA: I'm just going to pick up Luc

01:43:04.768 --> 01:43:06.958
and hold him so that he can see everything.

01:43:06.958 --> 01:43:08.615
MATT: He's like, (as Luc) "Whoa!"

01:43:09.668 --> 01:43:11.315
Yeza goes "It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:43:11.315 --> 01:43:13.958
"I've heard quite a few things. Ah, you know,

01:43:13.958 --> 01:43:17.678
"being a practitioner of a certain sort of

01:43:19.311 --> 01:43:20.891
"challenging craft myself."

01:43:20.891 --> 01:43:25.885
(as Pumat) "Really?" Well, what's your chosen skill set,

01:43:25.885 --> 01:43:29.408
"if I might ask? Wait, wait, don't tell me!

01:43:29.408 --> 01:43:32.218
"By the studious look in your eyes,

01:43:32.218 --> 01:43:34.718
"but the somewhat calloused fingertips there,

01:43:34.718 --> 01:43:36.611
"I'd say you delve in some form of,

01:43:38.058 --> 01:43:39.728
"perhaps alchemy?"

01:43:39.728 --> 01:43:42.038
SAM: That's exactly right! He's a chemist,

01:43:42.038 --> 01:43:43.545
and a damn fine one.

01:43:43.545 --> 01:43:46.928
And if you have anything you need to have him,

01:43:46.928 --> 01:43:50.958
you know, chemistry up, feel free to ask.

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:53.288
MATT: (as Yeza) "Please. I haven't been
able to practice in a while,

01:43:53.288 --> 01:43:55.318
"so I'm excited at that prospect."

01:43:55.318 --> 01:43:56.428
(as Pumat) "Well, yeah, totally.

01:43:56.428 --> 01:43:58.448
"I mean, let's be fair.

01:43:58.448 --> 01:44:01.568
"Most of my suppliers have baseline potions that I use for

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:05.158
"some of my personal creations
tend to (tongue clicking) upcharge me a bit.

01:44:05.158 --> 01:44:06.198
"So it would be nice to have

01:44:06.198 --> 01:44:09.405
"a little more of a direct wholesale relationship."

01:44:09.405 --> 01:44:12.189
(laughter)

01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:13.022
LAURA: Awesome.

01:44:13.022 --> 01:44:16.578
MATT: "So anyway, whatcha looking for?"

01:44:16.578 --> 01:44:17.628
TRAVIS: It depends on what you have.

01:44:17.628 --> 01:44:20.503
You always have such interesting items. What are your--

01:44:20.503 --> 01:44:23.422
What are your featured items currently?

01:44:23.422 --> 01:44:24.958
MATT: "I'm still sort of getting myself

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:27.051
"back up in the swing of things.

01:44:28.158 --> 01:44:31.118
"Got a couple of fairly decent potions

01:44:31.118 --> 01:44:34.958
"returned back unused from the front lines of battle."

01:44:34.958 --> 01:44:37.788
And he pulls out one vial.

01:44:37.788 --> 01:44:38.621
You can see the crystal,

01:44:38.621 --> 01:44:39.595
but the leather's wrapped tightly around it.

01:44:39.595 --> 01:44:40.998
You just can't really see the contents.

01:44:40.998 --> 01:44:42.678
And it has a little loop,

01:44:42.678 --> 01:44:44.858
so it can be thrown over a shoulder and worn there.

01:44:44.858 --> 01:44:48.178
It's a big vial. It's got a fair amount of liquid in it.

01:44:48.178 --> 01:44:50.128
He goes ahead and unsnaps the sides,

01:44:50.128 --> 01:44:51.498
and pulls it up, so you can see the liquid.

01:44:51.498 --> 01:44:55.398
It's this viscous,

01:44:55.398 --> 01:44:57.798
bourbon-looking brown liquid

01:44:57.798 --> 01:45:00.208
with an object floating in the bottom that, as he swirls it,

01:45:00.208 --> 01:45:02.338
it swirls quick and then slows down.

01:45:02.338 --> 01:45:04.408
It looks like a crescent.

01:45:04.408 --> 01:45:06.338
It's about that big, and it just floats

01:45:06.338 --> 01:45:08.786
around the bottom, like a crescent moon.

01:45:08.786 --> 01:45:10.219
LAURA: What is that?

01:45:10.219 --> 01:45:13.680
MATT: "This here? This is a fingernail."

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.418
LAURA: Gross.
MATT: "Stone giant."

01:45:15.418 --> 01:45:17.328
TRAVIS: From a stone giant?
MATT: "Yeah.

01:45:17.328 --> 01:45:20.648
"But don't ask me how I got it, I just had to pay some guy."

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:22.848
SAM: Does it give you the stone giant's strength?

01:45:22.848 --> 01:45:24.828
MATT: "For a short time, that indeed it does,

01:45:24.828 --> 01:45:26.863
"my astute halfling friend."

01:45:26.863 --> 01:45:27.929
SAM: Wow.

01:45:27.929 --> 01:45:28.968
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

01:45:28.968 --> 01:45:32.018
MATT: "So got that one there for you.

01:45:32.018 --> 01:45:34.811
"That one'll run you about, we'll say,"

01:45:35.958 --> 01:45:37.308
He looks at his books here.

01:45:38.798 --> 01:45:41.898
"Put that at about 1500 gold pieces,

01:45:41.898 --> 01:45:44.218
"but it puts you up at a mighty,

01:45:44.218 --> 01:45:46.278
"mighty amount of strength for about an hour."

01:45:46.278 --> 01:45:48.628
SAM: Okay.
LAURA and TALIESIN: Wow.

01:45:48.628 --> 01:45:51.215
MATT: "I got another one of these. Same batch, not used,"

01:45:51.215 --> 01:45:53.978
and he pulls up a similar type arrangement,

01:45:53.978 --> 01:45:55.838
same leather strap. These are all meant

01:45:55.838 --> 01:45:58.998
to be carried into battle and quickly drinken,

01:45:58.998 --> 01:46:00.171
and easy to access.

01:46:01.228 --> 01:46:04.698
"This one here is a special enhancement

01:46:04.698 --> 01:46:08.408
"to one's physical quickness and capabilities

01:46:08.408 --> 01:46:10.668
"for a short time, a very short time,

01:46:10.668 --> 01:46:12.578
"much shorter than the strength-based one.

01:46:12.578 --> 01:46:15.858
"But it's referred to as a Potion of Haste."

01:46:15.858 --> 01:46:19.150
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
ASHLEY: Potion of Haste!

01:46:19.150 --> 01:46:22.452
SAM: How much is that? <i>¿Cuánto cuesta?</i>

01:46:22.452 --> 01:46:24.955
MATT: "That one'll run you about, we'll say,

01:46:27.028 --> 01:46:28.898
"we'll say, about 1100."

01:46:28.898 --> 01:46:29.791
SAM: Okay. Okay.

01:46:33.458 --> 01:46:35.468
MATT: "Next, and this is something I was dabbling with,

01:46:35.468 --> 01:46:37.868
"I hope you have some fun time with this,

01:46:37.868 --> 01:46:39.378
"I think even the little one there

01:46:39.378 --> 01:46:40.928
"would kind of have fun!"

01:46:40.928 --> 01:46:42.311
And he goes into this back room,

01:46:42.311 --> 01:46:43.703
and starts looking for a second.

01:46:43.703 --> 01:46:46.597
And goes like, "Hey, Pumat III.

01:46:46.597 --> 01:46:49.288
"Looking for the, you know, the--"

01:46:49.288 --> 01:46:50.778
And he's like, "Oh, don't worry, boss,

01:46:50.778 --> 01:46:52.318
"I'll get it right for you."

01:46:52.318 --> 01:46:53.308
He goes back to the backroom,

01:46:53.308 --> 01:46:57.861
comes back, and there is this really beautiful-looking

01:46:57.861 --> 01:47:01.578
crushed velvet, blue cape,

01:47:01.578 --> 01:47:05.058
And like a cape-shawl combo,

01:47:05.058 --> 01:47:08.731
very, like, Victorian London-looking,

01:47:09.728 --> 01:47:12.378
with a deep red interior.

01:47:12.378 --> 01:47:14.578
He goes ahead, and hands it over to Pumat Prime.

01:47:14.578 --> 01:47:16.308
He takes it, and puts it around his shoulders,

01:47:16.308 --> 01:47:18.764
clasps it on and goes,

01:47:18.764 --> 01:47:20.548
"They call this..."

01:47:20.548 --> 01:47:21.818
And he poses,

01:47:21.818 --> 01:47:26.534
and the cape (whooshing) flutters behind him,

01:47:26.534 --> 01:47:28.358
and just looks epic.

01:47:28.358 --> 01:47:31.062
"Call this here a Cloak of Billowing"

01:47:31.062 --> 01:47:32.448
TRAVIS and SAM: Of Billowing?

01:47:32.448 --> 01:47:34.048
MATT: "Yeah."

01:47:34.048 --> 01:47:37.061
TRAVIS: Does it allow you to strike dramatic poses?

01:47:38.308 --> 01:47:41.521
MATT: "My friend, that's <i>exactly</i> what it does."

01:47:42.842 --> 01:47:43.900
TRAVIS: You're-- you're--

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.168
MATT: "Yeah, watch!" It does it again.

01:47:46.168 --> 01:47:47.388
Does it again.

01:47:47.388 --> 01:47:48.221
"Whenever you want!"

01:47:48.221 --> 01:47:49.620
MARISHA: It just gives you the Batman pose?

01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:51.476
MATT: "Yeah."
SAM: Does it help your charismatic abilities?

01:47:51.476 --> 01:47:52.888
ASHLEY: That's amazing.

01:47:52.888 --> 01:47:54.428
MATT: "I mean, in a sense that people

01:47:54.428 --> 01:47:55.868
"can't take their eyes off you when

01:47:55.868 --> 01:47:57.407
"you're just looking that amazing."

01:47:57.407 --> 01:48:00.475
TRAVIS: Charismatic bump or something. Charisma bump.

01:48:00.475 --> 01:48:01.625
(laughs)

01:48:01.625 --> 01:48:03.450
TRAVIS: They can't take their eyes off you?

01:48:03.450 --> 01:48:06.191
MATT: "I mean, if they're a lame individual, maybe.

01:48:06.191 --> 01:48:08.968
"It's not a fan of very cool looking people, but--"

01:48:08.968 --> 01:48:10.878
SAM: So it's just cool looking.

01:48:10.878 --> 01:48:12.828
How much is it?

01:48:12.828 --> 01:48:15.400
MATT: "That one 'll run you about 75 gold pieces."

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:17.660
MARISHA: Oh! We got to buy it!

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:19.397
TRAVIS: We're taking it.

01:48:19.397 --> 01:48:21.175
(laughter)

01:48:21.175 --> 01:48:22.700
MATT: That's literally all it does.

01:48:23.575 --> 01:48:24.968
It just looks cool.
ASHLEY: Amazing.

01:48:24.968 --> 01:48:27.528
MARISHA: That's amazing.
TRAVIS: Cloak of Billowing.

01:48:27.528 --> 01:48:28.638
MATT: It takes a bonus action to do it,

01:48:28.638 --> 01:48:31.027
but you can do it as many times as you want.

01:48:31.027 --> 01:48:33.221
ASHLEY: There's no, it's literally just--
MATT: Yeah.

01:48:33.221 --> 01:48:34.508
ASHLEY: -- just to look cool?

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:36.108
I love it so much.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:48:36.108 --> 01:48:38.141
ASHLEY: That's amazing.
TRAVIS: We got it.

01:48:38.141 --> 01:48:39.974
It's in our inventory.

01:48:42.822 --> 01:48:44.168
TALIESIN: I was also curious,

01:48:44.168 --> 01:48:47.868
how long does it take to enchant an item, in general?

01:48:47.868 --> 01:48:50.708
MATT: Oh, it depends on the extent of the enchantment.

01:48:50.708 --> 01:48:53.728
"Because simple things can be done in a few days,

01:48:53.728 --> 01:48:55.368
"maybe under a week.

01:48:55.368 --> 01:48:59.151
"More extensive ones, oh, they take a lot longer.

01:48:59.151 --> 01:49:00.848
"Unless you pay more, in which case, you know,

01:49:00.848 --> 01:49:02.298
"we can get all the Pumats in on it,

01:49:02.298 --> 01:49:03.908
"enchantments can be done a little quicker,

01:49:03.908 --> 01:49:06.248
"but once again, still limited by this scope

01:49:06.248 --> 01:49:08.048
"of what you're trying to accomplish."

01:49:09.648 --> 01:49:11.818
TALIESIN: Well, I was looking at my armor,

01:49:11.818 --> 01:49:14.908
and I've been wearing this for a while,

01:49:14.908 --> 01:49:17.468
and I thought maybe given it a bit of a,

01:49:17.468 --> 01:49:19.098
I don't know, a pick-me-up,

01:49:19.098 --> 01:49:19.938
MATT: "A pick-me-up?"

01:49:19.938 --> 01:49:23.388
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you had any ideas of just something to do

01:49:23.388 --> 01:49:25.788
to this thing, other than just maybe enchant it.

01:49:26.758 --> 01:49:29.358
The one thing is that we are leaving town in a week.

01:49:30.848 --> 01:49:32.861
MATT: "All right! Well, where are you heading off to,

01:49:32.861 --> 01:49:34.428
"if I could ask?"

01:49:34.428 --> 01:49:36.198
SAM: Cold, cold climate place.

01:49:36.198 --> 01:49:38.018
So if you have anything specifically

01:49:38.018 --> 01:49:43.018
for the cold environs, that would be of great assistance.

01:49:43.368 --> 01:49:44.708
MATT: "Well, yeah, there's there scopes there.

01:49:44.708 --> 01:49:46.098
"I could do a real simple enchantment.

01:49:46.098 --> 01:49:47.848
"That'll just help keep it comfortable

01:49:47.848 --> 01:49:49.568
"in all sorts of cold environments.

01:49:49.568 --> 01:49:51.358
"Make sure you don't have to deal

01:49:51.358 --> 01:49:55.558
"with any of that frozen landscapes sort of problems there.

01:49:55.558 --> 01:49:57.768
"That will be easy hundred gold enchantment,

01:49:57.768 --> 01:49:59.838
"and I can do that in, probably a day and a half

01:49:59.838 --> 01:50:01.598
"with these guys' help."

01:50:01.598 --> 01:50:03.430
TALIESIN: Anything fancier you think, or is that--

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:04.868
MATT: "Fancier?"
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:50:04.868 --> 01:50:07.458
MATT: "In the same vein?"
TALIESIN: Possibly the same vein.

01:50:07.458 --> 01:50:12.098
MATT: "I can give it a much more
involved enchantment, there.

01:50:12.098 --> 01:50:15.586
"Kind of make it a, actually--"
LAURA: Involves a fist up the butt.

01:50:16.678 --> 01:50:18.928
MATT: "Oh no, that was just more for emphasis,

01:50:18.928 --> 01:50:20.918
"I wasn't actually making--"
TRAVIS: It wasn't literal.

01:50:20.918 --> 01:50:23.571
MATT: "Yeah. That wasn't--"
LAURA: I misunderstood.

01:50:24.535 --> 01:50:26.580
MATT: That would have to be a very consensual thing.

01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:27.598
(laughter)

01:50:27.598 --> 01:50:28.868
SAM: Caduceus, were you looking for something

01:50:28.868 --> 01:50:30.368
for more protection as well?

01:50:30.368 --> 01:50:31.928
TALIESIN: Oh, possibly more protection,

01:50:31.928 --> 01:50:33.469
possibly--
MATT: "From cold?"

01:50:33.469 --> 01:50:35.358
TALIESIN: Hm?
MATT: "From cold?

01:50:35.358 --> 01:50:37.338
"Or just protection from everything?"

01:50:37.338 --> 01:50:38.738
TALIESIN: Actually, from anything in general.

01:50:38.738 --> 01:50:40.263
We don't really know what we're going to--

01:50:40.263 --> 01:50:41.170
other than, like--

01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:43.086
we're going to be seeing some crazy magic.

01:50:43.086 --> 01:50:45.318
We're going to be seeing some cold.

01:50:45.318 --> 01:50:48.138
MATT: "Okay, okay, well, let me see here then,

01:50:48.138 --> 01:50:49.688
"if that's what you're looking for,

01:50:49.688 --> 01:50:52.138
"I can just give yourself a basic enchantment,

01:50:52.138 --> 01:50:54.998
"Just a, we'll say, give it a little more

01:50:54.998 --> 01:50:56.688
"of a defensive capability,

01:50:56.688 --> 01:50:59.078
"help deflect physical blows

01:50:59.078 --> 01:51:00.258
"that come towards you."

01:51:00.258 --> 01:51:01.856
TALIESIN: That'd be amazing.

01:51:01.856 --> 01:51:04.051
MATT: Equivalent of a plus one enchantment.

01:51:05.088 --> 01:51:06.608
"All right, we'll say

01:51:09.458 --> 01:51:12.738
"that would all cost you about 2000 gold pieces

01:51:12.738 --> 01:51:13.978
"for the full enchantment.

01:51:13.978 --> 01:51:16.048
"And if I get off four--

01:51:16.048 --> 01:51:18.568
"If we're trying to get on a faster enchantment cycle.

01:51:18.568 --> 01:51:19.788
"It'll be a little more expensive,

01:51:19.788 --> 01:51:22.858
"I'll put it at about 2,600 gold,

01:51:22.858 --> 01:51:24.758
"but we can get that done in four days.

01:51:25.938 --> 01:51:28.308
"That's going to be all Pumats in on that one.

01:51:28.308 --> 01:51:29.318
"You guys all right with that?"

01:51:29.318 --> 01:51:30.358
They're like, "Yeah, we got you."

01:51:30.358 --> 01:51:32.348
"Yeah! Let me get my fingers loose.

01:51:32.348 --> 01:51:33.928
"How about you?"

01:51:33.928 --> 01:51:36.028
"Yeah, I'm not busy."

01:51:36.028 --> 01:51:37.768
"All right, four days."
TALIESIN: 2600 gold?

01:51:37.768 --> 01:51:40.178
MATT: "2600 gold for four days,

01:51:40.178 --> 01:51:44.088
"and we can get that to a nice little defensive capability."

01:51:44.088 --> 01:51:45.008
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

01:51:45.008 --> 01:51:46.739
MATT: "All righty."

01:51:46.739 --> 01:51:49.198
TALIESIN: And here's actually, if you can do something

01:51:49.198 --> 01:51:51.570
about the sheen. Here, I'll just give some papers

01:51:51.570 --> 01:51:53.539
with what I want to do to it.

01:51:53.539 --> 01:51:56.298
MATT: Takes his goggle over eye.

01:51:56.298 --> 01:51:57.131
"Okay. Yeah.

01:51:57.131 --> 01:51:59.638
"I can talk to somebody, and get some cosmetic changes

01:51:59.638 --> 01:52:03.443
"on there for you. No problem. Lickity splickity.

01:52:03.443 --> 01:52:05.865
"All right."
(laughter)

01:52:05.865 --> 01:52:08.041
TALIESIN: 2600?
MATT: "2600 gold."

01:52:09.328 --> 01:52:10.891
So in four days you'll have that,

01:52:10.891 --> 01:52:13.318
your armor will now be a plus one,

01:52:13.318 --> 01:52:14.551
which is a bonus to AC.

01:52:18.008 --> 01:52:19.388
TRAVIS: And do you happen to have anything,

01:52:19.388 --> 01:52:21.098
only because I'm always curious,

01:52:21.098 --> 01:52:24.865
of the offensive variety weapons, or any sort of--

01:52:27.508 --> 01:52:29.548
MATT: "Unfortunately, those haven't really come back.

01:52:29.548 --> 01:52:33.414
"The weapons were keenly plucked from my clutches,

01:52:33.414 --> 01:52:35.981
"for the interests of combat.

01:52:37.948 --> 01:52:39.098
"It's not really a weapon,

01:52:39.098 --> 01:52:41.998
"but I do got something pretty cool here.

01:52:41.998 --> 01:52:43.211
"Mind closing the door?"

01:52:44.304 --> 01:52:45.254
SAM: Oh yes, yes, yes.

01:52:47.578 --> 01:52:52.571
MATT: "So, this was actually commissioned and sent off

01:52:52.571 --> 01:52:56.604
"to a member of the Assembly who did not pick it up.

01:52:57.788 --> 01:52:58.621
"So,

01:53:00.748 --> 01:53:03.250
"you know, these things get lost in the mail all the time."

01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:06.548
TRAVIS: Pumat!
(laughter)

01:53:06.548 --> 01:53:09.561
TRAVIS: I like this side of you.

01:53:09.561 --> 01:53:10.606
MATT: He gives a (short whistle)

01:53:10.606 --> 01:53:13.058
and the other Pumats close the shades

01:53:13.058 --> 01:53:15.728
a little bit on the windows in the front.

01:53:15.728 --> 01:53:16.668
And he goes to his backroom room,

01:53:16.668 --> 01:53:19.068
comes back with this tiny, little

01:53:19.928 --> 01:53:22.628
polished redwood box.

01:53:22.628 --> 01:53:25.748
It glistens and gleans from the little bit of lantern light

01:53:25.748 --> 01:53:28.698
he has on the counter, and sets it down, opens it up.

01:53:28.698 --> 01:53:30.688
And it has this soft little pillow bed,

01:53:30.688 --> 01:53:32.518
and as you look on the inside,

01:53:32.518 --> 01:53:36.648
there is this tiny little pink gem,

01:53:36.648 --> 01:53:38.658
like a rhombus in its shape,

01:53:38.658 --> 01:53:40.408
and it's just placed on the pillow.

01:53:41.688 --> 01:53:44.488
"I know it doesn't look like much, but

01:53:45.958 --> 01:53:46.791
"these

01:53:48.338 --> 01:53:50.248
"are crafted

01:53:50.248 --> 01:53:51.586
"not by me,

01:53:55.718 --> 01:53:59.521
"but by certain enchanters who follow the Knowing Mistress.

01:54:02.258 --> 01:54:06.348
"This was a piece that had come into my personal holding

01:54:06.348 --> 01:54:08.058
"right before all this went down,

01:54:08.058 --> 01:54:08.891
"and then was

01:54:10.748 --> 01:54:14.441
"taken, as part of the agreement with the Assembly.

01:54:15.308 --> 01:54:17.611
"So it's referred to as an Ioun stone.

01:54:19.978 --> 01:54:21.169
"Watch this," and he it takes it,

01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:23.019
and just lets it go in the air,

01:54:23.019 --> 01:54:24.460
and you watch as it just

01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:26.951
slowly begins to orbit his head.

01:54:28.467 --> 01:54:30.537
LAURA: What does it do?

01:54:30.537 --> 01:54:32.717
MATT: "Oh, this one in particular

01:54:32.717 --> 01:54:34.780
"is an Ioun Stone of Fortitude.

01:54:36.017 --> 01:54:39.967
"Makes you hardier, makes you more able to

01:54:39.967 --> 01:54:43.707
"resist the more physically strenuous elements

01:54:43.707 --> 01:54:47.107
"on the body, both exterior and interior."

01:54:47.107 --> 01:54:49.360
LAURA: Wow, how much does it cost?

01:54:50.957 --> 01:54:54.490
MATT: "Well, cost me a pretty penny when I got ahold of it.

01:54:56.657 --> 01:54:57.757
"I'll put this at about--

01:54:58.887 --> 01:55:00.437
"friends discount--

01:55:01.779 --> 01:55:03.729
"5,500 gold."

01:55:07.737 --> 01:55:09.587
TRAVIS: We'll take it.

01:55:09.587 --> 01:55:10.819
MATT: "Well then."

01:55:10.819 --> 01:55:12.807
Puts it in the box, closes it and slides it forward.

01:55:12.807 --> 01:55:15.335
LAURA: How do you have that much gold?

01:55:15.335 --> 01:55:18.440
TRAVIS: I don't actually spend a ton of money.

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:22.754
SAM: Didn't you just spent 4,000 gold?
LAURA: You just spent 5,000 gold on a ring.

01:55:22.754 --> 01:55:25.107
MARISHA: He didn't spend anything else, though.

01:55:25.107 --> 01:55:26.957
LIAM: Been saving it for a rainy day.

01:55:26.957 --> 01:55:29.357
TRAVIS: I think I know at least one of us that

01:55:29.357 --> 01:55:30.887
could probably use that.

01:55:30.887 --> 01:55:32.777
LAURA: I think you're very, very right.

01:55:32.777 --> 01:55:34.152
SAM: Yeah, me!

01:55:35.410 --> 01:55:37.085
MATT: There's actually quite a few of you that could use it.

01:55:37.085 --> 01:55:38.890
(laughter)
LIAM: Pretty good thing.

01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:41.297
TRAVIS: 5,500 with my thanks.

01:55:41.297 --> 01:55:43.237
MATT: "All right. Well, that makes me very happy to know

01:55:43.237 --> 01:55:46.904
"that this is going to somebody
who will put it to proper use."

01:55:46.904 --> 01:55:48.404
"Always better to, you know,

01:55:48.404 --> 01:55:49.507
"sell the more...

01:55:50.557 --> 01:55:53.307
"powerful items to individuals that I know will,

01:55:54.867 --> 01:55:55.700
"you know,

01:55:57.529 --> 01:55:59.937
"not spill too much unnecessary blood with it."

01:56:00.907 --> 01:56:01.740
TRAVIS: No.

01:56:03.667 --> 01:56:06.093
I guess there goes my tattoo.

01:56:08.052 --> 01:56:08.943
LAURA: What?

01:56:08.943 --> 01:56:10.037
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I just, I just--

01:56:10.037 --> 01:56:12.207
So many people have gotten tattoos and other things

01:56:12.207 --> 01:56:13.557
and I've just sort of been...

01:56:15.167 --> 01:56:16.847
hoarding my money.

01:56:16.847 --> 01:56:18.007
SAM: That's great.

01:56:18.007 --> 01:56:21.500
LAURA: I've been spending mine on diamonds
to help save people's lives.

01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.797
(laughter)

01:56:24.797 --> 01:56:28.207
MATT: "You are incredibly selfless and I am just blown away

01:56:28.207 --> 01:56:30.644
"by how sweet and wonderful you are."

01:56:30.644 --> 01:56:32.086
LAURA: Thank you.
TALIESIN: So true.

01:56:32.086 --> 01:56:33.276
SAM: It's not just sweet and wonderful.

01:56:33.276 --> 01:56:37.307
She's used those diamonds to save many of our lives already.

01:56:37.307 --> 01:56:39.255
LAURA: That's true.
TALIESIN: Several times.

01:56:39.255 --> 01:56:40.371
LAURA: Yeah.

01:56:42.276 --> 01:56:44.447
SAM: Pumat?
MATT: "Yep?"

01:56:44.447 --> 01:56:48.237
SAM: If-- I had just a question or two.

01:56:48.237 --> 01:56:49.070
If I--

01:56:49.907 --> 01:56:52.067
if I wanted another one of those flasks--

01:56:52.067 --> 01:56:53.620
Did I get my flask from Pumat?

01:56:54.527 --> 01:56:55.597
MATT: You had it enchanted by Pumat.

01:56:55.597 --> 01:56:58.540
SAM: Yeah, if I had another one of those flasks made,

01:56:59.437 --> 01:57:01.397
is that something you could-- could handle?

01:57:01.397 --> 01:57:03.847
It's just the hard liquor now,

01:57:03.847 --> 01:57:05.777
I don't-- it doesn't-- the taste.

01:57:05.777 --> 01:57:07.737
I don't like it anymore,

01:57:07.737 --> 01:57:10.357
but something like a nice cherry brandy

01:57:10.357 --> 01:57:13.217
or a peach schnapps I could get down with.

01:57:13.217 --> 01:57:15.729
Just something like a little bit of a,

01:57:15.729 --> 01:57:17.627
you know, creme de menthe or something.

01:57:17.627 --> 01:57:20.695
Is there-- is there something that we--
LAURA: Maybe like a rosé or something?

01:57:20.695 --> 01:57:23.687
SAM: Ooh, a nice cold rosé, just always--

01:57:23.687 --> 01:57:26.585
always with me, maybe a little sparkle would be nice.

01:57:26.585 --> 01:57:28.327
LIAM: That'll be good in the tundra.

01:57:28.327 --> 01:57:30.117
MATT: "I could probably pull something like that together.

01:57:30.117 --> 01:57:33.769
"That'll be ah, I mean, all in--

01:57:33.769 --> 01:57:35.792
"all Pumats in-- once I finish what I'm doing with you,

01:57:35.792 --> 01:57:38.966
"which is going to consume a lot of
my time for the next four days.

01:57:38.966 --> 01:57:40.447
"Put me about a day and a half, two days.

01:57:40.447 --> 01:57:42.867
"I can get that done for ya."
SAM: Great, for how much--

01:57:42.867 --> 01:57:45.408
MATT: "But with all in, I can get it under a day.

01:57:45.408 --> 01:57:49.517
"And we'll say we'll put that at about

01:57:49.517 --> 01:57:51.685
"150 with the expedited pricing on it."

01:57:51.685 --> 01:57:52.910
SAM: Oh, that's cheap.

01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:54.215
I'll take it.

01:57:54.215 --> 01:57:57.177
MATT: "Well, it's not an extreme enchantment.

01:57:57.177 --> 01:57:59.657
"Are you providing the particular flask you're looking for?

01:57:59.657 --> 01:58:01.047
"Or do you need me to find that as well?"

01:58:01.047 --> 01:58:03.727
SAM: I have a really old shitty one,

01:58:03.727 --> 01:58:06.144
but I'll go get a new one

01:58:06.144 --> 01:58:08.727
and I'll bring it back to you before day's end.

01:58:08.727 --> 01:58:10.667
MATT: "All righty, we'll be here waitin'."

01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:11.912
SAM: And then also,

01:58:13.687 --> 01:58:16.937
in addition to anything you have
suited for cold environments,

01:58:18.107 --> 01:58:20.334
frequently, I find myself--

01:58:20.334 --> 01:58:24.397
I'm very good in one-on-one situations
or against one combatant,

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:28.257
but I don't have anything that really can

01:58:28.257 --> 01:58:30.907
knock a bunch of people away from me or--

01:58:30.907 --> 01:58:34.257
or get me out of a group or a pile on,

01:58:34.257 --> 01:58:36.957
a melee sort of a chaotic situation.

01:58:36.957 --> 01:58:39.717
Do you have anything, any scrolls, any potions,

01:58:39.717 --> 01:58:42.097
any enchantments that could either get me away

01:58:42.097 --> 01:58:43.950
or just knock everybody back?

01:58:46.817 --> 01:58:49.277
MATT: "Not to that degree at that moment, unfortunately.

01:58:49.277 --> 01:58:50.547
"I can keep an eye out, though."

01:58:50.547 --> 01:58:52.107
SAM: Okay! That's good.

01:58:52.107 --> 01:58:53.577
MATT: "Yeah, still limited, unfortunately,

01:58:53.577 --> 01:58:55.067
with what we got here in the shop,

01:58:55.067 --> 01:58:57.425
but if anything comes in, I'll let you know.

01:58:57.425 --> 01:58:59.137
SAM: All right, all right, good to know.

01:58:59.137 --> 01:59:00.847
MATT: "No worries. Yeah, bring that flask on by

01:59:00.847 --> 01:59:01.967
"and I'll go ahead and get that done

01:59:01.967 --> 01:59:04.463
"at the tail end of getting your commission finished."

01:59:04.463 --> 01:59:07.115
SAM: And then do you have anything for children?

01:59:07.115 --> 01:59:08.854
Do you have a children's section here?

01:59:09.987 --> 01:59:11.303
MATT: "Well, ah..."

01:59:13.137 --> 01:59:14.477
"What's your name, little guy?"

01:59:14.477 --> 01:59:16.457
LAURA: Oh, I'm still holding him.

01:59:16.457 --> 01:59:18.490
MATT: He says, "Luc."

01:59:19.587 --> 01:59:21.557
LAURA: I've got him, you know, in a comfortable hold now

01:59:21.557 --> 01:59:24.424
so he's not completely uncomfortable.

01:59:25.535 --> 01:59:28.410
MATT: (as Pumat) "Well, here, Luc,
let's see what we got here,"

01:59:28.410 --> 01:59:30.260
and then he walks into the back room with a wink.

01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:31.230
LAURA: I'm supporting his weight.
SAM: Oh.

01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:32.779
MATT: You hear him rummaging around a little bit.

01:59:32.779 --> 01:59:34.930
You hear something shift and a chest close.

01:59:36.487 --> 01:59:37.937
And he comes out with a smile

01:59:38.847 --> 01:59:41.320
and he sets a little ring on the table.

01:59:42.807 --> 01:59:45.227
"Let's see if that fits on your finger right there."

01:59:45.227 --> 01:59:48.512
And Luc's like, "Can I-- can I put it on?"

01:59:49.762 --> 01:59:52.460
LAURA: Can he put it on?
SAM: Yeah, of course, yes, yes.

01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:54.651
MATT: (Luc struggle grunts)

01:59:58.007 --> 01:59:58.840
"Cool."

02:00:00.807 --> 02:00:03.237
(as Pumat) "So go ahead and flick your finger."

02:00:05.627 --> 02:00:07.221
And you watch this little-- (poof)

02:00:07.221 --> 02:00:10.617
and a little top spills out onto the table.

02:00:10.617 --> 02:00:11.690
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:00:14.336 --> 02:00:15.436
SAM: Do it again.

02:00:16.479 --> 02:00:18.652
MATT: Flicks it, another top spills out on the table.

02:00:20.797 --> 02:00:23.164
And all these tops start-- (poofing)

02:00:23.164 --> 02:00:25.002
into a pile and Pumat's like,

02:00:25.002 --> 02:00:26.934
"Oh hey, don't get a little too hasty there.

02:00:26.934 --> 02:00:29.387
"They only last a short time, but no matter where you are,

02:00:29.387 --> 02:00:31.847
"if you're looking to go ahead and spin something,

02:00:31.847 --> 02:00:33.927
"right there for you."

02:00:33.927 --> 02:00:35.285
LAURA: How much is that ring?

02:00:35.285 --> 02:00:37.504
MATT: "I'll put you about 25 gold."

02:00:37.504 --> 02:00:38.885
LAURA: Do you have any more of them?

02:00:38.885 --> 02:00:40.749
MATT: "No, that's just the one I got.

02:00:40.749 --> 02:00:43.089
"Weirdly enough, not a lot of
people want to buy a ring

02:00:43.089 --> 02:00:44.821
"that just makes tops."

02:00:44.821 --> 02:00:45.904
SAM: It's a fidget spinner.

02:00:47.057 --> 02:00:49.610
MATT: "More or less."
TALIESIN: People are crazy if they don't want that.

02:00:49.610 --> 02:00:51.741
MATT: "Thank you, I appreciate the support."

02:00:53.197 --> 02:00:54.397
SAM: I love it. Yes, we'll take it.

02:00:54.397 --> 02:00:55.707
How much would that run?

02:00:55.707 --> 02:00:57.800
MATT: "25 gold pieces."
SAM: Oh, great, great, great.

02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.207
MATT: "Real simple enchantment."

02:01:00.698 --> 02:01:02.827
SAM: Thank you, Pumat, that's amazing!

02:01:02.827 --> 02:01:04.467
Luc, enjoy.

02:01:04.467 --> 02:01:05.906
MATT: Luc's over there going--

02:01:05.906 --> 02:01:08.391
and there's like-- (poofing)

02:01:08.391 --> 02:01:09.366
there's just a small pile growing

02:01:09.366 --> 02:01:10.724
and he's like, "This is the coolest thing!"

02:01:10.724 --> 02:01:12.997
SAM: Yeah, yeah, it is.

02:01:12.997 --> 02:01:16.847
LAURA: Luc, and you could probably
sell these tops for extra money!

02:01:16.847 --> 02:01:19.576
MATT: "Yeah, well, the tops, unfortunately, are temporary."

02:01:19.576 --> 02:01:20.905
LAURA: Oh, right.

02:01:20.905 --> 02:01:23.417
People won't know that until they walk away.

02:01:23.417 --> 02:01:25.014
SAM: Sell it fast, get out.

02:01:25.987 --> 02:01:29.469
MATT: "I am not engaging in that sort of...

02:01:30.474 --> 02:01:34.005
"<i>charlantanery</i>? What would you call it? Anyway.

02:01:34.005 --> 02:01:34.896
TALIESIN: Charcuterie, maybe.

02:01:34.896 --> 02:01:37.162
MATT: "There we are, <i>charcruterie</i>."

02:01:37.162 --> 02:01:38.497
(laughter)

02:01:38.497 --> 02:01:40.263
TALIESIN: Double checking it's just the

02:01:40.263 --> 02:01:43.857
base enchantment on there, not the cold protection?

02:01:43.857 --> 02:01:44.690
MATT: Correct.

02:01:45.867 --> 02:01:47.277
TALIESIN: I might shift just to cold protection

02:01:47.277 --> 02:01:48.377
but that's like-- yeah.

02:01:49.306 --> 02:01:51.859
I'll go straight cold production without the--

02:01:51.859 --> 02:01:53.142
SAM: What, you don't want the AC?

02:01:53.142 --> 02:01:54.735
TALIESIN: Plus one is good, but I have a funny feeling

02:01:54.735 --> 02:01:57.314
that the cold protection will
work out better in the long run.

02:01:57.314 --> 02:01:58.147
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: Really?

02:01:58.147 --> 02:01:59.377
TALIESIN: Or at least for now.

02:01:59.377 --> 02:02:01.137
SAM: Is it protection against cold damage

02:02:01.137 --> 02:02:02.827
or just against cold condition?

02:02:02.827 --> 02:02:04.957
TALIESIN: That's actually a good question.

02:02:04.957 --> 02:02:05.797
MATT: It would be-- they'd be

02:02:05.797 --> 02:02:07.017
comparable enchantments, I'll say.

02:02:07.017 --> 02:02:08.657
So you can choose one or the other.

02:02:08.657 --> 02:02:11.407
One gives you a plus one bonus to your armor class, period.

02:02:11.407 --> 02:02:13.407
The other one gives you cold resistance.

02:02:16.677 --> 02:02:18.777
TALIESIN: I'll take the armor class, fuck it, all right.

02:02:18.777 --> 02:02:22.045
MATT: All right, then we'll go as intended originally.

02:02:23.954 --> 02:02:25.220
MATT: I'm sure it won't come back to bite you in the ass.

02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:26.887
TALIESIN: Shopping paralysis.

02:02:26.887 --> 02:02:28.489
SAM: Oh, and then before we leave,

02:02:28.489 --> 02:02:31.487
did we want to Nonagon it up with Pumat?

02:02:31.487 --> 02:02:33.747
TALIESIN: That's actually a good question.

02:02:33.747 --> 02:02:35.404
LAURA: Sure.
SAM: Just in case?

02:02:35.404 --> 02:02:37.547
LAURA: Pumat, have you ever heard of anything called

02:02:37.547 --> 02:02:39.120
the Eyes of Nine?

02:02:41.737 --> 02:02:42.976
MATT: "Not particularly.

02:02:42.976 --> 02:02:44.697
"Is there, like, a creature with nine eyes

02:02:44.697 --> 02:02:45.869
"that I need to look out for?"

02:02:45.869 --> 02:02:48.847
LAURA: Well, no, not that we know of.

02:02:48.847 --> 02:02:51.007
We came across this creature

02:02:51.007 --> 02:02:53.987
that gave us a vision of a floating, creepy city

02:02:53.987 --> 02:02:55.705
that felt like it was alive.

02:02:56.707 --> 02:02:57.707
MATT: "That's awful."

02:02:57.707 --> 02:02:59.025
LAURA: Yeah, it was awful.

02:02:59.025 --> 02:03:00.804
TALIESIN: It was really, really quite a lot.

02:03:00.804 --> 02:03:03.667
LAURA: And it also made us think of the words

02:03:03.667 --> 02:03:05.047
Eyes of Nine, right?

02:03:05.047 --> 02:03:08.317
SAM: Yes, or Nonagon or Lucien or

02:03:09.247 --> 02:03:11.594
what was it, the Task Takers or something. What was it?

02:03:11.594 --> 02:03:13.162
LAURA: The Tomb Takers.

02:03:15.807 --> 02:03:18.477
MATT: "Not really jogging anything
in my noggin, unfortunately."

02:03:18.477 --> 02:03:20.143
LAURA: That's all right.
MATT: "Sorry."

02:03:20.143 --> 02:03:22.327
LAURA: No, no, no. Hey, do you know anything

02:03:22.327 --> 02:03:24.538
about the city of Aeor?

02:03:24.538 --> 02:03:25.521
MATT: "No."

02:03:25.521 --> 02:03:26.754
LAURA: Cool, just wondering.

02:03:28.747 --> 02:03:29.580
MATT: "Where's Aeor?"

02:03:30.647 --> 02:03:32.472
LAURA: I don't know.
SAM: It's way north.

02:03:32.472 --> 02:03:33.937
MATT: "Oh, I haven't been that far north.

02:03:33.937 --> 02:03:37.137
"I've just spend most of my time here in the Empire, so."

02:03:37.137 --> 02:03:37.970
TRAVIS: No, neither have we.

02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:39.357
We have no plans of going there, either.

02:03:39.357 --> 02:03:41.387
We've just heard people tell tales,

02:03:41.387 --> 02:03:43.277
of crazy weather up north.

02:03:43.277 --> 02:03:44.617
MATT: "Yeah, I hear it's pretty chilly."

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:45.647
TRAVIS: It is.

02:03:45.647 --> 02:03:47.977
No intention of going there.

02:03:47.977 --> 02:03:48.897
SAM: Why would we go there?

02:03:48.897 --> 02:03:49.987
MATT: "Yeah, me too.

02:03:49.987 --> 02:03:51.067
"These get all clammy.

02:03:51.067 --> 02:03:52.456
"I know it's got the little layer of fur

02:03:52.456 --> 02:03:54.461
"supposed to keep you warm, but (laughs)

02:03:54.461 --> 02:03:57.577
"I'm already cold out here on
this side of the Marrow Valley.

02:03:57.577 --> 02:03:59.975
"Can't imagine getting all snowed up, you know?"

02:03:59.975 --> 02:04:00.808
TRAVIS: Ridiculous.

02:04:02.697 --> 02:04:04.573
MATT: "Well, is there anything else I can help you with?"

02:04:04.573 --> 02:04:05.697
LAURA: Um!

02:04:05.697 --> 02:04:09.157
SAM: Oh, we should buy that stone giant potion.

02:04:09.157 --> 02:04:10.297
LAURA: I mean.

02:04:10.297 --> 02:04:11.560
SAM: Or I'll buy it, if--

02:04:12.497 --> 02:04:15.287
LAURA: I don't know. Do you think Caleb would like that?

02:04:15.287 --> 02:04:16.177
SAM: Someone could use it.

02:04:16.177 --> 02:04:18.215
LAURA: Caleb would probably like that potion of haste.

02:04:18.215 --> 02:04:20.117
TRAVIS: Yasha could use it, it's a plus two, right?

02:04:20.117 --> 02:04:22.223
SAM: Doesn't he have it?

02:04:22.223 --> 02:04:23.056
LIAM: He does.

02:04:24.727 --> 02:04:26.567
TRAVIS: That's the Ioun stone of fortitude, right?

02:04:26.567 --> 02:04:27.400
MATT: Correct.

02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:28.368
TRAVIS: Holy fuck.

02:04:28.368 --> 02:04:30.742
MATT: Yeah, it's a plus two to their constitution.

02:04:30.742 --> 02:04:32.942
TRAVIS: And an AC of 24.

02:04:33.787 --> 02:04:36.351
LAURA: Yeah, I don't know.
TRAVIS: When you're using it.

02:04:36.351 --> 02:04:38.417
LAURA: A potion is such a short use.

02:04:38.417 --> 02:04:40.487
And we have strong people in the party already.

02:04:40.487 --> 02:04:42.807
SAM: Yeah, but if you, for instance,

02:04:42.807 --> 02:04:45.627
one of our not strong people had it,

02:04:45.627 --> 02:04:47.632
it could maybe get them out of a jam or something.

02:04:47.632 --> 02:04:49.737
LAURA: It's true.

02:04:49.737 --> 02:04:51.027
SAM: Plus we got money to burn.

02:04:51.027 --> 02:04:52.334
LAURA: I don't have any money left.

02:04:52.334 --> 02:04:54.537
SAM: I got money to burn.

02:04:54.537 --> 02:04:57.067
LAURA: Unless you have anything worth 500 gold or less

02:04:57.067 --> 02:04:58.397
that's really cool.

02:04:58.397 --> 02:04:59.688
Do you, Pumat?

02:05:01.157 --> 02:05:03.160
MATT: Well, here, the <i>stone</i> has an AC of 24.

02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:04.695
SAM: I'll give you money.

02:05:04.695 --> 02:05:05.878
LAURA: No.
SAM: Because I have money.

02:05:05.878 --> 02:05:07.847
If you want something just--

02:05:07.847 --> 02:05:09.822
LAURA: No.
SAM: Okay.

02:05:09.822 --> 02:05:10.847
MATT: "Sorry, what was your question?"

02:05:10.847 --> 02:05:14.356
LAURA: Do you have anything cool worth 500 gold or less?

02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.823
MATT: "Um."

02:05:21.377 --> 02:05:22.730
SAM: Gift certificate, maybe?

02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:26.437
MATT: "I mean, you kind of--

02:05:26.437 --> 02:05:27.737
"if you're buying those potions as well,

02:05:27.737 --> 02:05:29.237
"you're clearing me out at the moment."

02:05:29.237 --> 02:05:31.380
LAURA: Okay, yeah, that's what I figured.

02:05:32.537 --> 02:05:33.370
MATT: "Sorry."

02:05:33.370 --> 02:05:35.503
LAURA: No, it's fine!
MATT: "Hey, I do have some feelers out

02:05:35.503 --> 02:05:37.424
"for some things that may return by the end of the week

02:05:37.424 --> 02:05:39.547
"with everything that's coming back from the front line.

02:05:39.547 --> 02:05:41.509
"So maybe I'll have something before you're leaving?"

02:05:41.509 --> 02:05:43.957
LAURA: Oh yeah, we'll check back in
when we pick up our stuff.

02:05:43.957 --> 02:05:45.857
TALIESIN: The flask and the armor, yep.

02:05:45.857 --> 02:05:46.805
MATT: "I'll keep an eye out for anything

02:05:46.805 --> 02:05:49.027
"that's in that range you're looking for."

02:05:49.027 --> 02:05:50.137
LAURA: Sounds good.

02:05:50.137 --> 02:05:52.445
MATT: "All righty."
SAM: I'll take that stone giant potion.

02:05:52.445 --> 02:05:54.569
MATT: "All righty, here you go.

02:05:54.569 --> 02:05:56.675
"Here's how the snaps work and you just hold it,"

02:05:56.675 --> 02:05:57.757
and he gives you a whole overview

02:05:57.757 --> 02:05:59.525
of the really simple apparatus

02:05:59.525 --> 02:06:01.142
that does not need an explanation.

02:06:02.397 --> 02:06:03.467
But he's thorough.

02:06:03.467 --> 02:06:04.300
SAM: Great.

02:06:06.567 --> 02:06:08.247
All right, let's get out of here.

02:06:08.247 --> 02:06:10.207
MATT: "Pleasure to see your lovely faces.

02:06:10.207 --> 02:06:12.577
"Say bye, Pumats," and they're like, "Bye!" "Bye!"

02:06:12.577 --> 02:06:13.881
"Good to see you!"

02:06:13.881 --> 02:06:16.213
TALIESIN: Bye, Pumat. Bye. Bye, Pumat.

02:06:16.213 --> 02:06:17.288
MATT: "Bye."
TALIESIN: Bye.

02:06:17.288 --> 02:06:18.121
MATT: "Bye!"

02:06:18.121 --> 02:06:20.477
TALIESIN: Good seeing you.
MATT: "Good seeing you, too.

02:06:20.477 --> 02:06:21.607
"It's good to see him, isn't it?"

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:22.827
"Yeah, you're telling me."

02:06:22.827 --> 02:06:24.187
"All right, well, have a good day."

02:06:24.187 --> 02:06:25.020
TALIESIN: You, too.

02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.887
Yeah, you too, also.

02:06:26.887 --> 02:06:27.867
MATT: "Thank you, buddy."

02:06:27.867 --> 02:06:31.285
"Aw, look at him he's so nice!" "I know, right?"

02:06:31.285 --> 02:06:33.677
LIAM: Doctor? Doctor.
TRAVIS: Doctor.

02:06:35.428 --> 02:06:38.715
MATT: As you guys exit and eventually find yourselves

02:06:38.715 --> 02:06:40.197
meeting up with the rest of the group

02:06:40.197 --> 02:06:42.987
here in Zadash after their burst of research

02:06:42.987 --> 02:06:44.657
at the library's concluded,

02:06:44.657 --> 02:06:45.877
we're going to go ahead and take a break.

02:06:45.877 --> 02:06:47.907
We've been on a ring here for a little while

02:06:47.907 --> 02:06:49.237
and I realized, "Oh shit, we haven't taken a break yet."

02:06:49.237 --> 02:06:50.607
So we're going to do that right now.

02:06:50.607 --> 02:06:52.197
So yeah, we'll be back here in a few minutes

02:06:52.197 --> 02:06:54.427
to pick up for the latter half of today's adventure.

02:06:54.427 --> 02:06:55.440
We'll see you then.

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:56.273
(cheering)

02:06:56.469 --> 02:06:59.189
Now experience the ultimate way to play

02:06:59.189 --> 02:07:02.179
by sitting at a table with your friends,

02:07:02.179 --> 02:07:04.159
with your face in a screen.

02:07:04.159 --> 02:07:05.469
Progress!

02:07:05.469 --> 02:07:07.449
D&amp;D Beyond.

02:07:07.449 --> 02:07:11.399
Log in to explore strange worlds and fantastical cities

02:07:11.399 --> 02:07:14.509
thanks to a company based in a really boring one

02:07:14.509 --> 02:07:15.909
that handles all the tedious

02:07:15.909 --> 02:07:17.679
math and reference stuff for you

02:07:17.679 --> 02:07:19.219
so you can finally unleash

02:07:19.219 --> 02:07:20.769
the Epic quest you've been crafting

02:07:20.769 --> 02:07:22.959
since middle school on your friends.

02:07:22.959 --> 02:07:25.219
Or just do what most people use it for

02:07:25.219 --> 02:07:26.839
cranking out endless new characters

02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:28.169
while they're bored at work.

02:07:28.169 --> 02:07:29.859
I could finish these spreadsheets,

02:07:29.859 --> 02:07:32.682
but what if this Paladin owned a horse?

02:07:32.682 --> 02:07:35.149
(uplifting music)

02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:36.309
Perfect.

02:07:36.309 --> 02:07:40.370
D&amp;D Beyond, play with advantage.

02:07:40.805 --> 02:07:43.554
(wind howling)
(pages rustling)

02:07:43.554 --> 02:07:45.745
Let me tell you a story,

02:07:45.745 --> 02:07:49.595
a story about a group of nerdy-ass voice actors

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:52.214
who decided to roll the dice

02:07:52.214 --> 02:07:54.627
and play a tabletop RPG together.

02:07:56.214 --> 02:07:58.784
As they triumphantly battled dragons,

02:07:58.784 --> 02:08:01.364
aberrations and even gods,

02:08:01.364 --> 02:08:04.704
little did they know just how far their stories would reach

02:08:05.604 --> 02:08:10.054
for this game would grow into so much more.

02:08:10.054 --> 02:08:13.004
And so the nerdy-ass voice actors vowed

02:08:13.004 --> 02:08:15.114
to spread the joy of their stories

02:08:15.114 --> 02:08:16.664
to all who reigned.

02:08:16.664 --> 02:08:18.840
Okay, okay, okay. (record scratch)

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.374
Matt, mind if I take it from here?

02:08:21.374 --> 02:08:22.904
Oh, sure.

02:08:22.904 --> 02:08:24.184
Thanks, buddy.

02:08:24.184 --> 02:08:27.074
So our home game started just like any other

02:08:27.074 --> 02:08:29.084
but once the show began to take off,

02:08:29.084 --> 02:08:32.184
and we received so much support from the community,

02:08:32.184 --> 02:08:33.934
we knew we wanted to pay it forward

02:08:33.934 --> 02:08:37.274
and use our platform to raise money for charity.

02:08:37.274 --> 02:08:39.874
Early on, we partnered with 826LA

02:08:39.874 --> 02:08:42.234
because we felt like supporting creative writing

02:08:42.234 --> 02:08:45.284
in children fit with our love of storytelling.

02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:46.484
And we've helped raise money

02:08:46.484 --> 02:08:48.034
for a number of other charities

02:08:48.034 --> 02:08:51.194
with causes close to our hearts, such as.

02:08:51.194 --> 02:08:52.554
Red Nose Day.

02:08:52.554 --> 02:08:53.856
OutRight International.

02:08:53.856 --> 02:08:55.316
OSD.

02:08:55.316 --> 02:08:56.574
And Pablove.

02:08:56.574 --> 02:08:58.260
Just to name a few.

02:08:58.260 --> 02:08:59.994
Over these past few years,

02:08:59.994 --> 02:09:01.824
Critical Role and the Critter community

02:09:01.824 --> 02:09:06.207
has raised over $600,000 for charitable organizations.

02:09:07.114 --> 02:09:07.947
(mischievous laughter)

02:09:07.947 --> 02:09:09.534
These endeavors made us realize

02:09:09.534 --> 02:09:10.764
that our mission, (crashing)

02:09:10.764 --> 02:09:11.904
not just as a company,

02:09:11.904 --> 02:09:14.164
but as a group of friends is to leave-

02:09:14.164 --> 02:09:16.366
Leave this world better than we found it.

02:09:16.366 --> 02:09:17.594
(chuckling)

02:09:17.594 --> 02:09:18.474
Thanks, Taliesin.

02:09:18.474 --> 02:09:23.474
And thus, we're proud to bring you (dramatic music)

02:09:24.674 --> 02:09:27.574
the Critical Role Foundation,

02:09:27.574 --> 02:09:29.244
a nonprofit organization

02:09:29.244 --> 02:09:31.564
that's dedicated to that mission.

02:09:31.564 --> 02:09:32.924
Furthering our charitable efforts

02:09:32.924 --> 02:09:34.364
and building a deeper relationship

02:09:34.364 --> 02:09:35.754
with nonprofit organizations

02:09:35.754 --> 02:09:37.444
has been a dream of ours for a while.

02:09:37.444 --> 02:09:39.654
And now that dream has come true.

02:09:39.654 --> 02:09:42.674
This allows us to run specific fundraising campaigns

02:09:42.674 --> 02:09:45.854
for causes we and the Critter community care about.

02:09:45.854 --> 02:09:48.644
And given the state of the world these days,

02:09:48.644 --> 02:09:50.734
a percentage of every dollar raised

02:09:50.734 --> 02:09:52.953
will be allocated into an emergency fund

02:09:52.953 --> 02:09:55.724
to allow CRF to donate funds

02:09:55.724 --> 02:09:57.954
in the event of a natural disaster

02:09:57.954 --> 02:09:59.454
or other unforeseen events

02:09:59.454 --> 02:10:01.983
that require immediate humanitarian assistance.

02:10:01.983 --> 02:10:03.354
(dinging)

02:10:03.354 --> 02:10:04.954
And since Critical Role Foundation

02:10:04.954 --> 02:10:07.764
is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit,

02:10:07.764 --> 02:10:11.764
your donation is 100% tax deductible in the United States.

02:10:11.764 --> 02:10:13.673
Travis, read the room.

02:10:13.673 --> 02:10:17.114
It's a storybook, not a tax return.

02:10:17.114 --> 02:10:19.374
The cast and company are working hand in hand

02:10:19.374 --> 02:10:20.424
with this foundation

02:10:20.424 --> 02:10:22.894
with Ashley here as its president.

02:10:22.894 --> 02:10:24.624
Thank you, Madam President.

02:10:24.624 --> 02:10:28.074
(cheering)
(chuckling)

02:10:28.074 --> 02:10:29.684
For those who've donated in the past

02:10:29.684 --> 02:10:32.241
and for those who donate in the future,

02:10:32.241 --> 02:10:35.644
we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

02:10:35.644 --> 02:10:36.959
You can learn more and donate

02:10:36.959 --> 02:10:40.077
at criticalrolefoundation.org.

02:10:41.014 --> 02:10:43.534
And thus begins a whole new chapter

02:10:43.534 --> 02:10:46.550
for this group of nerdy-ass voice actors.

02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:48.007
The end.

02:10:49.114 --> 02:10:51.094
Well, not literally, of course,

02:10:51.094 --> 02:10:55.881
but that's the end of this storybook announcement.

02:10:56.895 --> 02:10:59.478
(lively music)

02:11:11.015 --> 02:11:13.454
Hey, critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:11:13.454 --> 02:11:16.662
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:11:16.662 --> 02:11:17.974
(jazzy music)

02:11:17.974 --> 02:11:22.090
ooh, look at this, look at the details, ooh.

02:11:22.090 --> 02:11:24.374
(jazzy music)

02:11:24.374 --> 02:11:26.467
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:11:28.954 --> 02:11:31.304
You're only like five clicks away from owning this,

02:11:31.304 --> 02:11:33.564
maybe more if you have a lot of windows

02:11:33.564 --> 02:11:35.814
open on your browser, I don't know your life.

02:11:37.774 --> 02:11:39.984
Darling, I'd recommend buying two.

02:11:39.984 --> 02:11:44.397
One for you and another for you, let's be honest.

02:11:46.844 --> 02:11:48.784
This is, this is a lot of stuff, you guys,

02:11:48.784 --> 02:11:51.491
we have like so many cool things right now.

02:11:54.345 --> 02:11:57.077
All this and more now available in the Critirole shop.

02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:02.513
Subscribe,

02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:06.123
or don't subscribe,

02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:10.103
(man sighs) that's not a question.

02:12:12.410 --> 02:12:15.700
Well that is noble in the mind to ponder the pros

02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:18.973
and more pros of Twitch or Twitch prime.

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.520
Or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters

02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:25.403
who find they can't afford them.

02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:28.313
To play,

02:12:31.210 --> 02:12:32.043
to sleep,

02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:35.143
no more.

02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:40.200
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew of Critical Role

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.900
might find their naps around the hectic schedule

02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:45.670
of a live broadcast that we have brought

02:12:45.670 --> 02:12:49.703
for your consumption, both Critter and fan alike.

02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:53.433
To play,

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.443
or sleep?

02:12:57.077 --> 02:12:58.800
(man scoffs)

02:12:58.800 --> 02:12:59.793
No sleep,

02:13:00.810 --> 02:13:02.663
but just to stream.

02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:06.023
All right there's the rub.

02:13:07.150 --> 02:13:12.143
For, with your subscription, what screens may come.

02:13:15.670 --> 02:13:18.390
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tagline.

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:19.313
Did we got that?

02:13:20.252 --> 02:13:22.593
Oh, that is Twitch poetry.

02:13:23.991 --> 02:13:25.370
(man grunting)

02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:29.380
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:31.450
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe,

02:13:31.450 --> 02:13:32.960
gift some subscriptions.

02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.653
You, you got it.

02:13:38.890 --> 02:13:43.692
Wrong slogan for the skull, but that's been good.

02:13:43.692 --> 02:13:46.359
(upbeat music)

02:26:45.267 --> 02:26:46.307
MATT: Welcome back.

02:26:46.307 --> 02:26:49.747
So, Mighty Nein, as you all gather in the middle

02:26:49.747 --> 02:26:52.247
of the streets of the Pentamarket here in Zadash.

02:26:52.247 --> 02:26:56.030
You reconvene, and what would you like to do?

02:26:57.377 --> 02:26:58.210
MARISHA: Oh.

02:26:59.135 --> 02:27:00.537
LAURA: Beau, we need to go somewhere.

02:27:00.537 --> 02:27:02.519
MARISHA: We've met up.

02:27:02.519 --> 02:27:03.637
MATT: Yes, you're now meeting up.

02:27:03.637 --> 02:27:04.860
TRAVIS: We've all reconvened.

02:27:05.897 --> 02:27:06.730
ASHLEY: Hello?

02:27:06.730 --> 02:27:08.547
TRAVIS: We got some shit in Pumat's.

02:27:08.547 --> 02:27:09.556
TALIESIN: We did very well.

02:27:09.556 --> 02:27:11.427
TRAVIS: We stocked up a bit.
LAURA: Here's your money. I didn't spend it.

02:27:11.427 --> 02:27:13.095
LIAM: Oh, that's okay, I trust you to--

02:27:13.095 --> 02:27:16.273
TRAVIS: He had really, really good stuff.

02:27:16.273 --> 02:27:18.217
I believe we got a potion,

02:27:18.217 --> 02:27:20.667
we got some stuff for your son.

02:27:20.667 --> 02:27:23.247
SAM: Yeah, we got an amazing ring.

02:27:23.247 --> 02:27:24.927
MARISHA: What did Luc get?

02:27:24.927 --> 02:27:27.485
SAM: He got a ring of dreidels,

02:27:27.485 --> 02:27:29.151
little dreidel ring.
MATT: "Watch!" And he does this

02:27:29.151 --> 02:27:31.805
and a little top goes (small thud).

02:27:32.764 --> 02:27:33.807
MARISHA and LIAM: Whoa!

02:27:33.807 --> 02:27:34.657
MARISHA: I want one.

02:27:34.657 --> 02:27:36.067
LAURA: I know, I do, too.

02:27:36.067 --> 02:27:38.517
How cool would it be? You could use it for caltrops.

02:27:38.517 --> 02:27:39.835
(caltrops flinging)

02:27:39.835 --> 02:27:42.040
MARISHA: Or ball bearings, once again.

02:27:43.430 --> 02:27:46.087
TRAVIS: Endless uses, but we did actually grab this---

02:27:46.087 --> 02:27:47.600
MATT: Luc hides the ring.

02:27:49.047 --> 02:27:49.880
MARISHA: Jealous.

02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:52.077
TRAVIS: We got this stone. It's an Ioun stone.

02:27:52.077 --> 02:27:55.017
They're very, very rare.

02:27:55.017 --> 02:27:55.957
LIAM: Oh, yes.

02:27:55.957 --> 02:27:59.284
TRAVIS: I thought either you could use it or you, Yasha,

02:27:59.284 --> 02:28:02.987
but I know that you are particularly susceptible to damage

02:28:02.987 --> 02:28:05.178
and if I'm right,

02:28:05.178 --> 02:28:08.295
this should help with that quite a bit.

02:28:08.295 --> 02:28:10.860
LIAM: That would have been awfully costly.

02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:11.927
LAURA: It was.
TRAVIS: It was.

02:28:11.927 --> 02:28:13.191
LAURA: He spent so much money on you.

02:28:13.191 --> 02:28:14.755
LIAM: How much was it?

02:28:16.047 --> 02:28:18.807
TRAVIS: About 5,000 gold pieces.

02:28:18.807 --> 02:28:21.247
Again, very rare.
LAURA: It cost more than dresses for horses

02:28:21.247 --> 02:28:23.340
I'll tell you that much.

02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:24.240
LIAM: My goodness.

02:28:28.587 --> 02:28:31.717
I don't know how I would repay.

02:28:31.717 --> 02:28:34.164
I don't have that much money, Fjord.

02:28:34.164 --> 02:28:36.943
MARISHA: I mean, you built us a pretty awesome tower.

02:28:36.943 --> 02:28:37.926
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:28:37.926 --> 02:28:39.925
LIAM: Yeah, but it's gone now.

02:28:39.925 --> 02:28:43.167
TRAVIS: I know-- oh no! And I just toss it to Caleb.

02:28:43.167 --> 02:28:45.052
LIAM: Do I catch it? I hope so.

02:28:45.052 --> 02:28:47.014
SAM: Nope it broke.
MATT: (shattering)

02:28:47.014 --> 02:28:49.156
TRAVIS: Fuck!
(laughter)

02:28:49.156 --> 02:28:51.156
MATT: That would be amazing.

02:28:52.410 --> 02:28:54.256
MATT: It's outside Pumat's. "What happened?

02:28:54.256 --> 02:28:55.553
"Everything okay?"

02:28:55.553 --> 02:28:56.386
"Nothing!"

02:28:56.386 --> 02:28:59.617
TRAVIS: Up! Up! Up!

02:28:59.617 --> 02:29:04.284
LIAM: Vess DeRogna here, I've come to collect my Ioun stone.

02:29:06.432 --> 02:29:08.470
MATT: You do catch it after a couple fumbles.

02:29:09.415 --> 02:29:12.207
LAURA: Ooh! I run back in to Pumat's.

02:29:12.207 --> 02:29:13.377
If we're outside of Pumat's.

02:29:13.377 --> 02:29:14.218
MATT: Yes.

02:29:14.218 --> 02:29:16.001
LAURA: Hey! Pumat?
MATT: "Yeah?"

02:29:16.001 --> 02:29:17.395
LAURA: Can I ask you a question?

02:29:17.395 --> 02:29:20.367
Who was the member of the Assembly that

02:29:20.367 --> 02:29:21.590
that stone was for?

02:29:22.447 --> 02:29:24.163
MATT: "That one was for--"

02:29:24.163 --> 02:29:27.271
He goes and opens up his ledger here.

02:29:29.687 --> 02:29:32.110
"That was commissioned by--"

02:29:35.662 --> 02:29:37.941
Actually, who would it be commissioned by?

02:29:37.941 --> 02:29:39.220
Let me double check.

02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:41.407
SAM: Good old Zivan Margolin.

02:29:41.407 --> 02:29:42.450
MATT: No, not Zivan Margolin.

02:29:42.450 --> 02:29:45.000
MARISHA: Yeah, good old...

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.091
Athesius Uludan.

02:29:47.091 --> 02:29:50.048
SAM: Good old Jenna...Eraser?
LIAM: Iresor.

02:29:50.048 --> 02:29:51.781
MATT: Jenna Iresor. It would be, yeah.

02:29:51.781 --> 02:29:52.781
ALL: Oh.

02:29:55.067 --> 02:29:57.227
LAURA: Do you know what Jenna looked like?

02:29:58.718 --> 02:30:01.114
MATT: "Yeah. Why do you ask?"

02:30:02.487 --> 02:30:04.470
LAURA: Just so that, you know,

02:30:04.470 --> 02:30:05.982
if we happen to run into them,

02:30:05.982 --> 02:30:09.404
then we don't, you know, have it.

02:30:09.404 --> 02:30:11.187
In our possession.

02:30:11.187 --> 02:30:15.287
MATT: "Fair enough, Jenna, last I saw her, at least,

02:30:15.287 --> 02:30:19.027
"she had this long,

02:30:19.027 --> 02:30:22.217
"blondish hair that went about mid-back or so.

02:30:22.217 --> 02:30:26.197
"Usually tied pretty tightly back through,

02:30:26.197 --> 02:30:27.970
"segmented braids.

02:30:29.407 --> 02:30:31.230
"Very serious expression."

02:30:32.117 --> 02:30:32.950
LAURA: Okay.

02:30:34.727 --> 02:30:36.307
MATT: "Outfits change from time to time.

02:30:36.307 --> 02:30:38.937
"We didn't cross paths too often, but--"

02:30:38.937 --> 02:30:40.467
LAURA: Okay.

02:30:40.467 --> 02:30:41.877
Thank you.

02:30:41.877 --> 02:30:43.060
MATT: "Welcome!"

02:30:44.857 --> 02:30:46.387
LAURA: Have a good day.

02:30:46.387 --> 02:30:47.761
MATT: "You too."

02:30:48.667 --> 02:30:51.360
LAURA: It was for Jenna-- it starts with an I.

02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:52.601
SAM: Eraser.
LIAM: Iresor.

02:30:52.601 --> 02:30:55.388
LAURA: Iresor, yes, it was for Jenna Iresor.

02:30:56.817 --> 02:30:58.697
LIAM: That is sensitive information.

02:30:58.697 --> 02:31:01.738
TRAVIS: I think we should generally
hide it around Assembly members.

02:31:01.738 --> 02:31:05.397
LAURA: Probably. I was just making sure it wasn't for Vess.

02:31:05.397 --> 02:31:06.299
TRAVIS: Right.
LAURA: Because that would--

02:31:06.299 --> 02:31:07.408
SAM: Or Trent.

02:31:07.408 --> 02:31:08.241
LAURA: Ugh.

02:31:09.387 --> 02:31:10.287
If it was for Trent--

02:31:10.287 --> 02:31:11.482
LIAM: Well, that'd be a power move.

02:31:11.482 --> 02:31:13.107
LAURA: Yeah.

02:31:13.107 --> 02:31:14.577
That would be amazing.

02:31:14.577 --> 02:31:15.667
TRAVIS: But yes, use it.

02:31:15.667 --> 02:31:16.810
It'll serve you well.

02:31:17.997 --> 02:31:20.947
That is about the extent of my funds, though.

02:31:20.947 --> 02:31:23.317
LIAM: Well, know I cannot repay you in full,

02:31:23.317 --> 02:31:24.370
but please, here, take--

02:31:25.637 --> 02:31:28.707
I pull out three platinum and put them in my pocket

02:31:28.707 --> 02:31:31.616
and I hand over a sack with 180 platinum.

02:31:31.616 --> 02:31:32.627
TRAVIS: Woo.

02:31:32.627 --> 02:31:35.957
LIAM: Don't "woo" me; you just spent more than twice that.

02:31:35.957 --> 02:31:37.476
TRAVIS: Oh, that's very true, thank you.

02:31:37.476 --> 02:31:39.707
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: (chuckles)

02:31:39.707 --> 02:31:40.978
LAURA: That's the one I just gave back to you?

02:31:40.978 --> 02:31:43.107
LIAM: That is correct.

02:31:43.107 --> 02:31:45.711
TRAVIS: See, I buy things that aren't just for me!

02:31:45.711 --> 02:31:48.570
LAURA: Good for you, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Thank you very much.

02:31:51.217 --> 02:31:54.277
SAM: So we go to see The Gentleman now?

02:31:54.277 --> 02:31:55.997
MARISHA: Should we head to the Evening Nook?

02:31:55.997 --> 02:31:57.777
SAM and LAURA: Nip?
MARISHA: Nip.

02:31:57.777 --> 02:32:00.572
LAURA: I mean, sure.

02:32:01.907 --> 02:32:02.802
SAM: What are we doing there?

02:32:02.802 --> 02:32:04.557
Why are we going there?

02:32:04.557 --> 02:32:05.780
ASHLEY: The Gentleman?

02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:08.453
SAM: We're going to talk about Nonagon again?

02:32:08.453 --> 02:32:11.337
LIAM: Little family reunion and maybe--

02:32:11.337 --> 02:32:12.427
TRAVIS: Talk with them?
MARISHA: A little check-in.

02:32:12.427 --> 02:32:13.857
LAURA: We're going to hook The Gentleman up

02:32:13.857 --> 02:32:15.487
with my mom again, obviously.

02:32:15.487 --> 02:32:17.557
SAM: Should we forge a letter

02:32:17.557 --> 02:32:19.227
real quick from your mom?

02:32:19.227 --> 02:32:20.827
LAURA: We don't need to.

02:32:20.827 --> 02:32:21.937
MARISHA: Back to the parent trap?

02:32:21.937 --> 02:32:22.770
SAM: Yeah.

02:32:22.770 --> 02:32:24.907
MARISHA: Don't need to? Wait, what, what, why?

02:32:24.907 --> 02:32:25.857
Why wouldn't we need to?

02:32:25.857 --> 02:32:28.754
LAURA: Because my mom told me I could talk to him about her.

02:32:28.754 --> 02:32:32.484
SAM: Yeah, but it's more fun if they don't know about it.

02:32:32.484 --> 02:32:33.726
LAURA: But she knows about it.

02:32:33.726 --> 02:32:35.893
SAM: Yeah, but he doesn't.

02:32:37.277 --> 02:32:38.430
LAURA: No, I don't like it.

02:32:39.461 --> 02:32:40.294
SAM: I'm going to do it.

02:32:40.294 --> 02:32:41.460
LAURA: No.

02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:43.159
SAM: I'm going to meddle in your mom and dad's affairs.

02:32:43.159 --> 02:32:44.250
LAURA: No, don't do it.

02:32:44.250 --> 02:32:46.979
(laughter)

02:32:50.635 --> 02:32:52.127
TRAVIS: Leave it to little Veth.

02:32:53.395 --> 02:32:55.177
MARISHA: We head to the Evening Nip?

02:32:55.177 --> 02:32:56.287
MATT: All righty.

02:32:56.287 --> 02:32:58.737
So you guys arrive at the dive bar

02:32:58.737 --> 02:33:00.867
that it's been quite some time since you arrived.

02:33:00.867 --> 02:33:01.826
Make your way in, and there

02:33:01.826 --> 02:33:04.537
Clive Binz is waiting, the older crusty dwarf

02:33:04.537 --> 02:33:07.547
who has to lean in a bit and look a bit intently at you

02:33:07.547 --> 02:33:09.863
before going, "I remember.

02:33:10.967 --> 02:33:12.177
"Password?"

02:33:12.177 --> 02:33:13.847
SAM and MARISHA: We bring many gifts.

02:33:13.847 --> 02:33:16.250
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, make your way in."

02:33:17.747 --> 02:33:19.027
You guys head back down

02:33:19.027 --> 02:33:22.444
the curved staircase into the subterranean stone chamber--

02:33:22.444 --> 02:33:24.271
SAM: He should really change the password, like, every year.

02:33:24.271 --> 02:33:27.247
MARISHA: Yeah, absolutely. That's got to spread over time.

02:33:27.247 --> 02:33:28.080
SAM: Totally.

02:33:32.587 --> 02:33:36.327
MATT: Entering the familiar interior of the den,

02:33:36.327 --> 02:33:38.047
at least the central area, you can see

02:33:38.047 --> 02:33:40.037
there are a handful of people that are in the process

02:33:40.037 --> 02:33:43.617
of marking out something on paper, on a table.

02:33:43.617 --> 02:33:44.867
They're all leaning in closely.

02:33:44.867 --> 02:33:46.664
And they all look and notice you enter

02:33:46.664 --> 02:33:48.727
and they just fold it up and put it away.

02:33:48.727 --> 02:33:50.367
LAURA: Is The Gentleman with them?

02:33:50.367 --> 02:33:53.476
MATT: No, but The Gentleman--

02:33:53.476 --> 02:33:55.095
You do look up

02:33:55.095 --> 02:33:57.267
and you can see him currently reading something

02:33:57.267 --> 02:34:00.177
on the balcony to his upper chambers,

02:34:00.177 --> 02:34:03.237
and as you all step down and that hush hits the room

02:34:03.237 --> 02:34:04.857
he leans forward.

02:34:04.857 --> 02:34:05.690
"Aha!

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:10.529
"Wasn't expecting you quite so soon."

02:34:12.107 --> 02:34:12.940
LAURA: We're here!

02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:16.297
MATT: "Welcome welcome, what business do you have?"

02:34:16.297 --> 02:34:17.130
LAURA: Well,

02:34:19.214 --> 02:34:20.887
can we come up there?

02:34:20.887 --> 02:34:22.297
MATT: "Better I come down there.

02:34:22.297 --> 02:34:24.187
"Give me just a few moments."

02:34:24.187 --> 02:34:27.277
SAM: Now Luc, this is a bar, so--

02:34:27.277 --> 02:34:28.337
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:34:28.337 --> 02:34:29.387
MARISHA: He's been in bars.

02:34:29.387 --> 02:34:30.507
MATT: Oh, that's right.

02:34:30.507 --> 02:34:33.168
TRAVIS: No milk. The milk was...

02:34:34.637 --> 02:34:36.557
SAM: Or they can wait outside.

02:34:36.557 --> 02:34:38.287
MATT: It's your call.

02:34:38.287 --> 02:34:39.997
SAM: I'm fine them coming down.

02:34:39.997 --> 02:34:41.807
But maybe I'll put them in a--

02:34:41.807 --> 02:34:42.689
MATT: Okay, well, we'll say,

02:34:42.689 --> 02:34:45.447
as you guys are descending the stairs into the interior,

02:34:45.447 --> 02:34:48.297
Yeza goes, "Um, honey, I--

02:34:48.297 --> 02:34:50.924
"I don't know if this is the best place for me and Luc."

02:34:50.924 --> 02:34:53.040
SAM: Do you want to just stay in the upstairs area?

02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:55.627
MATT: "Even that's kind of not a great place.

02:34:55.627 --> 02:34:56.937
"You know, we're just going to take

02:34:56.937 --> 02:34:58.745
"a little walk around the block.

02:35:00.337 --> 02:35:02.737
"Just give a holler when you're done."

02:35:02.737 --> 02:35:04.527
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:35:04.527 --> 02:35:06.477
I'll send a magical message when we're done.

02:35:06.477 --> 02:35:07.913
MATT: "I appreciate it. Luc, Luc!"

02:35:07.913 --> 02:35:09.955
And you can see Luc is already running down the stairs and

02:35:09.955 --> 02:35:11.447
Yeza grabs his arm and pulls him back

02:35:11.447 --> 02:35:14.357
and is like, "We'll see you all in a little bit.

02:35:14.357 --> 02:35:16.417
"Come on, you little sucker."

02:35:16.417 --> 02:35:18.384
And they make their way up and out.

02:35:19.257 --> 02:35:21.829
But nevertheless, after waiting for a moment,

02:35:21.829 --> 02:35:23.627
The Gentleman comes down.

02:35:23.627 --> 02:35:25.997
He's exchanged his lounge robe

02:35:25.997 --> 02:35:27.947
with somewhat nice presentory attire.

02:35:27.947 --> 02:35:30.555
He's got a little bit of a cravat

02:35:30.555 --> 02:35:32.929
showing over his fine waistcoat,

02:35:32.929 --> 02:35:34.567
except for it's a little loose and tumbled out.

02:35:34.567 --> 02:35:36.737
So it looks a little thrown together.

02:35:36.737 --> 02:35:38.267
It may have been, or it's intentional.

02:35:38.267 --> 02:35:39.777
It's like a air he likes to put off.

02:35:39.777 --> 02:35:41.247
But nevertheless, he goes,

02:35:41.247 --> 02:35:44.167
"It is so good to see all of you. Welcome back.

02:35:44.167 --> 02:35:45.000
"Drinks, please.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.417
"A round for the Mighty... Nein? I got it right?

02:35:47.417 --> 02:35:48.300
"Was that correct?"

02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:49.777
TRAVIS: Yes, yes.

02:35:49.777 --> 02:35:51.267
MATT: "All right, well.

02:35:51.267 --> 02:35:54.930
"What, Jester and friends, do I have the pleasure?"

02:35:56.837 --> 02:36:00.737
LAURA: Oh, well, first of all,

02:36:00.737 --> 02:36:03.297
Mama said to say hi,

02:36:03.297 --> 02:36:05.908
but she doesn't miss you too much.

02:36:08.107 --> 02:36:09.750
But she looked really pretty.

02:36:11.787 --> 02:36:16.022
And you could go say hi if you ever wanted to, she said.

02:36:17.287 --> 02:36:18.653
MATT: "Very good to know."

02:36:20.675 --> 02:36:23.767
SAM: Was it more of an invitation than that?

02:36:23.767 --> 02:36:25.077
Don't you think?

02:36:25.077 --> 02:36:27.337
LAURA: Just nonchalantly.

02:36:27.337 --> 02:36:31.569
She was like, he could come if he wanted to.

02:36:31.569 --> 02:36:33.986
(whispers) But she wants-- you know what I mean.

02:36:35.347 --> 02:36:36.377
MATT: "Fair enough."

02:36:36.377 --> 02:36:40.017
LAURA: Anyway, we're also here to talk about...

02:36:40.017 --> 02:36:41.155
SAM: Before we do, though,

02:36:41.155 --> 02:36:42.221
do you think we should tell her

02:36:42.221 --> 02:36:44.804
a specific date he'll be coming?

02:36:44.804 --> 02:36:45.847
LAURA: Yes, do you--

02:36:45.847 --> 02:36:47.553
do you want me to give a message in return?

02:36:47.553 --> 02:36:49.487
'Cause you know, I see her so often now

02:36:49.487 --> 02:36:51.567
and she's going to wonder about it and--

02:36:51.567 --> 02:36:52.717
MATT: "Drinks. (snaps)"

02:36:54.247 --> 02:36:56.154
And at this point the drinks come in and

02:36:56.154 --> 02:36:57.767
"Ah," and pass it around.

02:36:57.767 --> 02:36:59.727
"I am a very busy man.

02:36:59.727 --> 02:37:00.957
"When I find a moment,

02:37:00.957 --> 02:37:04.027
"I will happily take a journey to Nicodranas.

02:37:05.787 --> 02:37:06.917
"Trust me."

02:37:10.084 --> 02:37:10.917
SAM: Okay.

02:37:14.297 --> 02:37:16.769
TRAVIS: We actually were here on other business.

02:37:16.769 --> 02:37:17.747
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:37:17.747 --> 02:37:21.060
MATT: "Other business. Yes, what is this other business?"

02:37:21.977 --> 02:37:25.205
MARISHA: Well, we've reached out to Cree.

02:37:26.084 --> 02:37:28.387
MATT: "That's right, you asked about them."

02:37:28.387 --> 02:37:31.217
MARISHA: They seemed a little distracted or busy.

02:37:33.327 --> 02:37:35.685
I know that they could help us but

02:37:37.267 --> 02:37:40.207
beyond that, do you know any other members

02:37:40.207 --> 02:37:41.840
from the Tomb Takers?

02:37:42.839 --> 02:37:44.392
MATT: "Tomb Takers?

02:37:44.392 --> 02:37:45.257
"Not particularly.

02:37:45.257 --> 02:37:47.817
"I know Cree's spoken about them a handful of times

02:37:47.817 --> 02:37:50.257
"and when we first took her onto our crew,

02:37:50.257 --> 02:37:53.437
"that was one of the kind of

02:37:53.437 --> 02:37:56.127
"background elements that intrigued me, having

02:37:56.127 --> 02:37:58.417
"someone of a cutthroat heritage in Shadycreek Run,

02:37:58.417 --> 02:38:01.117
"who delves in a skillset like

02:38:01.117 --> 02:38:05.797
"being a divine blood crafter is a very rare thing.

02:38:05.797 --> 02:38:07.437
"So it was very useful.

02:38:07.437 --> 02:38:09.577
"I was actually honestly very sad that she left.

02:38:09.577 --> 02:38:11.207
"I was-- I liked--"
MARISHA: She left?

02:38:11.207 --> 02:38:13.957
She doesn't work for you anymore, period?

02:38:13.957 --> 02:38:15.637
She's not just on a mission somewhere?

02:38:15.637 --> 02:38:18.202
MATT: "No, no, she, she absconded but

02:38:19.049 --> 02:38:20.290
"a month and a half, two months ago."

02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:22.417
LAURA: Oh, I didn't understand that when you said it,

02:38:22.417 --> 02:38:25.167
I thought that she was off on a mission or something.

02:38:25.167 --> 02:38:26.000
MATT: "No, no.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.737
"She packed her things and left.

02:38:27.737 --> 02:38:32.107
"Said she was done with her business with me.

02:38:32.107 --> 02:38:34.340
"Not in an angry way, but in a very--

02:38:36.587 --> 02:38:38.580
"maybe she grew bored, I don't know."

02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:41.087
LAURA: Was there something that triggered her leaving?
MARISHA: Did she give any other indications? Yes.

02:38:41.087 --> 02:38:42.437
MATT: "No, it was rather sudden."

02:38:43.497 --> 02:38:46.037
LIAM: She didn't mention where she was headed off to?

02:38:46.037 --> 02:38:48.807
MATT: "No, we don't usually share that information.

02:38:48.807 --> 02:38:51.567
"Kind of a business preference of keeping things

02:38:51.567 --> 02:38:53.460
"vague and plausibly deniable."

02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:55.717
MARISHA: Did she leave any belongings behind,

02:38:55.717 --> 02:38:59.107
a room that's not been taken over yet

02:38:59.107 --> 02:39:00.582
that we can take a look at?

02:39:00.582 --> 02:39:02.087
TALIESIN: It really is important.

02:39:02.087 --> 02:39:03.999
MATT: "The room has already been taken over.

02:39:03.999 --> 02:39:05.142
"You can inspect it, if you want.

02:39:05.142 --> 02:39:08.030
"The only thing she left behind from me in particular was--"

02:39:09.722 --> 02:39:13.067
And he goes back into his chamber

02:39:13.067 --> 02:39:15.137
and then comes back with a small case

02:39:15.137 --> 02:39:18.127
with about two dozen blood vials in it

02:39:18.127 --> 02:39:19.208
that are all capped and goes,

02:39:19.208 --> 02:39:22.037
"I mean, I have all these various blood contracts,

02:39:22.037 --> 02:39:27.037
"but without my blood keeper, I have no use for them so."

02:39:27.092 --> 02:39:28.597
TRAVIS: Are we in that box?

02:39:28.597 --> 02:39:29.430
MATT: "Yes."

02:39:30.797 --> 02:39:32.617
TRAVIS: Who else is so unlucky to have found their way

02:39:32.617 --> 02:39:33.820
into your box?

02:39:39.047 --> 02:39:40.167
It was worth a try.

02:39:40.167 --> 02:39:43.409
LAURA: Are you sure that's everybody's blood?

02:39:43.409 --> 02:39:45.959
Are you sure Cree didn't take it with her?

02:39:47.837 --> 02:39:49.117
MATT: "In what way?"

02:39:49.117 --> 02:39:51.150
LAURA: Well, like, what if she left you

02:39:51.150 --> 02:39:52.827
with just vials of red liquid

02:39:52.827 --> 02:39:55.330
and she actually took the blood?

02:39:55.330 --> 02:39:56.487
MATT: "Well, then good. I'm glad at least someone

02:39:56.487 --> 02:39:57.545
"can make use of it."

02:39:57.545 --> 02:39:59.917
LAURA: No, that's our blood!

02:40:01.345 --> 02:40:03.467
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:40:03.467 --> 02:40:06.184
I like your dad.
LAURA: What if she could kill us from afar!?

02:40:06.184 --> 02:40:08.487
MATT: "I don't think she could kill you from afar.

02:40:08.487 --> 02:40:11.997
"Cree was useful, but Cree wasn't dangerous."

02:40:11.997 --> 02:40:14.795
LAURA: Oh, really?
TALIESIN: It's everybody's blood?

02:40:14.795 --> 02:40:16.107
SAM: Oh, maybe not yours.
ASHLEY: Are they labeled?

02:40:16.107 --> 02:40:17.667
TALIESIN: No, I did it later.

02:40:17.667 --> 02:40:19.417
I just didn't think that...

02:40:21.487 --> 02:40:22.697
TRAVIS: It was all of us.

02:40:22.697 --> 02:40:24.977
LAURA: Can we have our blood back, then?

02:40:24.977 --> 02:40:25.815
TALIESIN: Does that mean that there's--

02:40:25.815 --> 02:40:27.857
SAM: Are there labels?
TALIESIN: -- Molly's blood in there?

02:40:27.857 --> 02:40:29.415
MATT: Yes, there are labels.

02:40:29.415 --> 02:40:30.697
SAM: Also Matt, before we got in here,

02:40:30.697 --> 02:40:33.307
Beau gave me her wind fan

02:40:33.307 --> 02:40:35.657
and I've been slowly fanning myself

02:40:35.657 --> 02:40:38.967
and slowly actually trying to fan The Gentleman.

02:40:38.967 --> 02:40:40.169
To try to get some of that moisture--

02:40:40.169 --> 02:40:43.405
MARISHA: Oh yeah, where you turn the fan outward

02:40:43.405 --> 02:40:44.550
a little bit in your direction.

02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:46.133
LIAM: Oscillating.

02:40:46.133 --> 02:40:47.167
ASHLEY: Are the--

02:40:47.167 --> 02:40:48.027
MATT: "If you'd like yours back,

02:40:48.027 --> 02:40:50.028
"we're no longer under contract."

02:40:50.028 --> 02:40:52.408
LAURA: I'll just get it myself, if you want.

02:40:52.408 --> 02:40:54.841
MATT: "Well, here." And he helps you begin--

02:40:54.841 --> 02:40:56.267
LAURA: Yeah, as I'm doing that I'm going to just

02:40:56.267 --> 02:40:59.867
try to get a peek at some of the other names on the vials.

02:40:59.867 --> 02:41:01.675
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

02:41:04.227 --> 02:41:05.897
TRAVIS: Which one will you choose?

02:41:05.897 --> 02:41:08.087
Will it serve you or will it betray you?

02:41:08.087 --> 02:41:11.827
Because there are thousands others just like it.

02:41:11.827 --> 02:41:14.465
TALIESIN: Is Cree in there as well or no?

02:41:14.465 --> 02:41:15.298
MATT: "No, no, no,

02:41:15.298 --> 02:41:17.448
Cree didn't take her own blood."
LAURA: (silly laugh)

02:41:17.448 --> 02:41:19.329
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:41:19.329 --> 02:41:21.504
(singing Southern accent) And it's my CR dice!

02:41:21.504 --> 02:41:24.109
(laughter)
SAM: Ding!

02:41:24.109 --> 02:41:26.590
MATT: And then that is the end
of the commercial right there.

02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:31.924
These are all single first names.

02:41:31.924 --> 02:41:34.207
And the labels are scratched in a handwriting

02:41:34.207 --> 02:41:35.677
that's hard to read.

02:41:35.677 --> 02:41:38.747
You see your names, at least the names that were given

02:41:38.747 --> 02:41:41.507
when the blood was originally taken,

02:41:41.507 --> 02:41:45.038
which, if I recall, most of them were honest.

02:41:46.037 --> 02:41:49.559
You see names like Milos

02:41:49.559 --> 02:41:51.967
and Miladen.

02:41:51.967 --> 02:41:54.520
You also see a Lech.

02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:55.445
LAURA: Lech?
MATT: Lech.

02:41:55.445 --> 02:41:56.678
L-E-C-H.

02:41:57.917 --> 02:41:59.242
You see a--

02:41:59.242 --> 02:42:00.983
TRAVIS: Shut your fucking face.

02:42:00.983 --> 02:42:02.365
MATT: -- Jazna.

02:42:02.365 --> 02:42:03.837
LAURA: Jazna?

02:42:03.837 --> 02:42:05.207
MATT: And those are the ones that you--

02:42:05.207 --> 02:42:06.697
that are just immediately facing you

02:42:06.697 --> 02:42:08.417
that you can see.

02:42:08.417 --> 02:42:11.897
And altogether there's about maybe 20 or so vials in here.

02:42:13.187 --> 02:42:15.247
LAURA: 20 or so?
MATT: Yeah.

02:42:15.247 --> 02:42:16.080
At a first glance.

02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:17.447
And after he helps you get to the vials,

02:42:17.447 --> 02:42:18.684
he closes it up again.

02:42:18.684 --> 02:42:23.077
LAURA: The 20 or so left or 20 or so including ours?

02:42:23.077 --> 02:42:25.524
MATT: Sorry, left on top of yours.

02:42:25.524 --> 02:42:26.357
TALIESIN: Did we get the--?

02:42:26.357 --> 02:42:28.477
MARISHA: Should we get the Molly?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:42:28.477 --> 02:42:30.992
MARISHA: Can we trade you

02:42:32.445 --> 02:42:35.525
for nothing for one of those vials?

02:42:36.643 --> 02:42:38.957
MATT: "I'm sorry, I don't quite follow."

02:42:38.957 --> 02:42:41.999
MARISHA: We want that one that's labeled Mollymauk.

02:42:41.999 --> 02:42:42.832
LAURA: (gasps)

02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:44.698
MATT: "Oh.

02:42:46.187 --> 02:42:48.672
"It is technically somebody who is no longer

02:42:48.672 --> 02:42:50.160
"under contract with me.

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:51.593
"If I recall, they met a--"

02:42:51.593 --> 02:42:52.637
MARISHA: Yeah, he's definitely dead.

02:42:52.637 --> 02:42:54.064
TRAVIS: Some smart person take this, here.

02:42:54.064 --> 02:42:56.457
MARISHA: Oh, okay, I'll keep--

02:42:56.457 --> 02:42:59.147
MATT: "I will ask as a favor, though.

02:42:59.147 --> 02:43:01.817
"And because I'm showing such gracious

02:43:01.817 --> 02:43:03.507
"trust in your side, too.

02:43:03.507 --> 02:43:08.137
"If anyone were to ask, these are still very binding."

02:43:08.137 --> 02:43:09.525
LAURA: Of course, of course.

02:43:10.857 --> 02:43:12.347
We would never let on.

02:43:12.347 --> 02:43:15.977
Cree didn't leave any of her blood here, did she?

02:43:15.977 --> 02:43:18.607
MATT: "I'm afraid not. This was her purview."

02:43:18.607 --> 02:43:20.902
TALIESIN: No idea where she would have gone?

02:43:20.902 --> 02:43:24.865
Where she was from? Even if she'd gone back home or--

02:43:24.865 --> 02:43:26.227
MATT: "All I knew was that she had done some work

02:43:26.227 --> 02:43:27.737
"in Shadycreek and beyond,

02:43:27.737 --> 02:43:30.037
"and a few other places in the empire.

02:43:30.037 --> 02:43:31.217
"I mean, there's a lot of ne'er do wells.

02:43:31.217 --> 02:43:32.794
"We get people in here from Yrrosa.

02:43:32.794 --> 02:43:34.267
"We have ex Myriad members.

02:43:34.267 --> 02:43:36.587
"We have individuals that come from northward.

02:43:36.587 --> 02:43:38.517
"We have folks that come from the Menagerie Coast

02:43:38.517 --> 02:43:39.917
"and we don't ask too many questions.

02:43:39.917 --> 02:43:42.047
"We just want to see what they can do

02:43:42.047 --> 02:43:44.467
"and make sure that they don't wander too far

02:43:44.467 --> 02:43:47.347
"from our little specification."

02:43:47.347 --> 02:43:50.097
TALIESIN: The Eyes of Nine doesn't
mean anything to you either?

02:43:51.687 --> 02:43:53.972
MATT: "No, not particularly."

02:43:53.972 --> 02:43:55.688
ASHLEY: Nonagon?
MATT: "Should it?

02:43:56.568 --> 02:43:59.635
"Nonagon. Cree mentioned that once or twice, I think.

02:44:06.267 --> 02:44:07.827
"I think that's about it.

02:44:07.827 --> 02:44:09.402
"At least from what I can recall."

02:44:10.711 --> 02:44:12.850
TALIESIN: Going to have to find Cree.

02:44:12.850 --> 02:44:14.158
TRAVIS: Might have to--
LAURA: I could scry.

02:44:14.158 --> 02:44:15.987
TRAVIS: -- check in on them.

02:44:15.987 --> 02:44:16.820
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:18.409 --> 02:44:19.250
MARISHA: All right.

02:44:19.250 --> 02:44:20.133
LAURA: Should I do that?

02:44:21.267 --> 02:44:22.547
MARISHA: Yeah, can you?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:44:22.547 --> 02:44:23.747
LAURA: Yeah, of course I can.

02:44:26.097 --> 02:44:26.997
TRAVIS: We don't want to take up too much

02:44:26.997 --> 02:44:28.655
of your father's busy time.

02:44:28.655 --> 02:44:31.088
LAURA: Why?
MARISHA: Is there anything else we need from him?

02:44:33.297 --> 02:44:34.897
LAURA: I mean--

02:44:34.897 --> 02:44:37.970
I mean, I guess we don't <i>need</i> anything else.

02:44:39.647 --> 02:44:41.467
Just, you know,

02:44:41.467 --> 02:44:42.300
a hug

02:44:43.614 --> 02:44:45.679
for your favorite daughter.

02:44:49.387 --> 02:44:51.017
MATT: He looks around the room

02:44:51.017 --> 02:44:53.004
and there are a few individuals that are like--

02:44:55.264 --> 02:44:56.317
There's a few individuals that are

02:44:56.317 --> 02:44:57.617
leaning into the conversation,

02:44:57.617 --> 02:45:00.350
just keeping clean ears and he goes, "Ahem,"

02:45:00.350 --> 02:45:01.687
and they get back to the table.

02:45:01.687 --> 02:45:03.507
They gather their things, the paper they have folded up,

02:45:03.507 --> 02:45:05.507
and they go ahead and move over to a further table over

02:45:05.507 --> 02:45:06.957
and while they're moving he comes over

02:45:06.957 --> 02:45:09.290
and gives a little side hug.

02:45:11.422 --> 02:45:16.046
(laughter)

02:45:16.046 --> 02:45:18.584
TRAVIS: That's you as a little kid, wasn't it?

02:45:18.584 --> 02:45:19.584
Pulling the strings.

02:45:21.817 --> 02:45:23.484
MATT: "Well, anyway,

02:45:23.484 --> 02:45:26.682
"I was in the middle of a very engrossing tome

02:45:26.682 --> 02:45:30.337
"before getting to my evening clients

02:45:30.337 --> 02:45:31.768
"I have to speak with a bit later today."

02:45:31.768 --> 02:45:33.464
LAURA: What were you reading?

02:45:33.464 --> 02:45:35.640
MATT: "You are so curious."

02:45:36.887 --> 02:45:39.187
LAURA: I just want to know what your interests are.

02:45:40.182 --> 02:45:41.332
MATT: "I have many interests.

02:45:41.332 --> 02:45:43.097
"Don't be afraid to ask about that."

02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:47.137
And he goes in steps up to his room

02:45:47.137 --> 02:45:49.887
and comes back with a book.

02:45:49.887 --> 02:45:52.067
The cover's very plain, red leather cover.

02:45:52.067 --> 02:45:54.177
It looks a little worn at the edges, corner's a little bent.

02:45:54.177 --> 02:45:57.892
He goes, "This is more of a historical tome.

02:45:59.957 --> 02:46:01.467
"It might not be of interest to you.

02:46:01.467 --> 02:46:04.230
"You seem to be more of a fictional-based."

02:46:05.167 --> 02:46:06.167
LAURA: You don't know.

02:46:06.167 --> 02:46:09.937
MATT: "Well, this recounts the founding of the Myriad

02:46:09.937 --> 02:46:14.300
"in Yrrosa and was actually taken.

02:46:18.657 --> 02:46:23.337
"This used to belong to a lawmaster in Rexxentrum

02:46:23.337 --> 02:46:28.337
"and was a collection of figures of interest at the time.

02:46:28.377 --> 02:46:33.377
"I just like to be in the know in case certain folks

02:46:33.507 --> 02:46:35.927
"of a less than reputable background try and come

02:46:35.927 --> 02:46:37.390
"in under my employ.

02:46:38.237 --> 02:46:39.504
"I want to know who to--

02:46:42.247 --> 02:46:44.412
"who to intimidate properly."

02:46:44.412 --> 02:46:46.948
LAURA: Wow. That's cool.

02:46:49.897 --> 02:46:51.898
MATT: "Not as shiny, I'm sorry."

02:46:51.898 --> 02:46:52.731
LAURA: That's cool.

02:46:52.731 --> 02:46:55.287
TRAVIS: Have you had any experience
in Eiselcross by the way?

02:46:55.287 --> 02:46:57.257
Far, far north?

02:46:57.257 --> 02:46:58.567
MATT: "Not personally no,

02:46:58.567 --> 02:46:59.777
"but I know there's been

02:47:01.061 --> 02:47:04.787
"a slow trickle of a trade coming down

02:47:04.787 --> 02:47:07.277
"through the Greying Wildlands, yes."

02:47:07.277 --> 02:47:09.234
TRAVIS: Of what? What sort of item?

02:47:10.677 --> 02:47:12.447
MATT: "Historical relics that have interest

02:47:12.447 --> 02:47:15.247
"to various keepers of

02:47:15.247 --> 02:47:18.857
"ancient objects and enchantments.

02:47:18.857 --> 02:47:20.507
"There've been relics and such.

02:47:20.507 --> 02:47:22.937
"They haven't come directly through us in Zadash,

02:47:22.937 --> 02:47:25.793
"but there's been word passing through of individuals

02:47:25.793 --> 02:47:29.667
"intercepting and interest growing in that space.

02:47:29.667 --> 02:47:31.077
"Actually, there's quite a bit of money being made

02:47:31.077 --> 02:47:34.567
"to sell equipment up northward for a pretty penny.

02:47:34.567 --> 02:47:36.017
"The Empire does not sell up that way.

02:47:36.017 --> 02:47:37.947
"They keep everything internally.

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:41.957
"So outside interests who want equipment,

02:47:41.957 --> 02:47:44.537
"and very specific and specialized equipment,

02:47:44.537 --> 02:47:48.637
"well, they have to go through more underground means."

02:47:48.637 --> 02:47:51.260
TRAVIS: Excavation equipment, digging, mining equipment,

02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:53.057
that sort of thing, or?

02:47:53.057 --> 02:47:54.472
MATT: "Sometimes."

02:47:54.472 --> 02:47:56.135
LAURA: What other kinds of equipment?

02:47:56.135 --> 02:47:57.932
MATT: "Other kinds of equipment.

02:47:57.932 --> 02:47:59.632
"Don't worry yourself with it."

02:48:04.899 --> 02:48:06.757
TRAVIS: This drink is delicious.

02:48:06.757 --> 02:48:07.690
MARISHA: So good.

02:48:09.107 --> 02:48:12.287
MATT: "Well, let me get back to my reading.

02:48:12.287 --> 02:48:13.924
"You're welcome to stay as long as you'd like.

02:48:13.924 --> 02:48:15.827
"And by that, I mean a few more hours

02:48:15.827 --> 02:48:17.377
"before we have some more clients arrive.

02:48:17.377 --> 02:48:21.027
"I prefer to perhaps not have family and friends

02:48:21.027 --> 02:48:22.260
"around at the time.

02:48:23.877 --> 02:48:25.177
"But it is good to see you."

02:48:26.427 --> 02:48:27.840
LAURA: I may never see you again.

02:48:29.117 --> 02:48:31.860
But it's been good while it lasted.

02:48:32.977 --> 02:48:34.427
I'm glad we found each other.

02:48:36.367 --> 02:48:37.483
I love you, Dad.

02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:44.537
MATT: Are you playing up the bottom lip and drama of it?

02:48:44.537 --> 02:48:45.767
Make a deception check.

02:48:45.767 --> 02:48:46.664
TRAVIS: The bottom lip.

02:48:47.697 --> 02:48:49.055
How appropriate.

02:48:53.217 --> 02:48:54.237
LAURA: 14.

02:48:54.237 --> 02:48:56.552
MATT: Okay, he gives you, like, a--

02:48:59.425 --> 02:49:01.689
"(chuckles)"

02:49:01.689 --> 02:49:05.139
And he rustles your hair a little bit.

02:49:07.137 --> 02:49:08.868
"Until the next time."

02:49:08.868 --> 02:49:09.701
LAURA: Okay.

02:49:13.157 --> 02:49:14.357
TRAVIS: Was a pleasure.

02:49:14.357 --> 02:49:15.190
MATT: "Indeed.

02:49:16.927 --> 02:49:18.947
"If she comes back with but a scratch,

02:49:18.947 --> 02:49:20.627
"I will destroy you all."

02:49:20.627 --> 02:49:21.687
TALIESIN: Fair.

02:49:21.687 --> 02:49:23.867
ASHLEY: We will destroy anyone who gives her a scratch.

02:49:23.867 --> 02:49:24.917
MATT: "Good."

02:49:24.917 --> 02:49:25.787
ASHLEY: One step ahead.

02:49:25.787 --> 02:49:26.937
MATT: "Your drinks are free."

02:49:29.682 --> 02:49:31.807
SAM: Thank you, Gentleman.

02:49:31.807 --> 02:49:33.537
Thank you, <i>The</i> Gentleman.

02:49:36.037 --> 02:49:37.187
MATT: Doesn't even respond.

02:49:39.994 --> 02:49:41.697
He side glances every time the wind hits him.

02:49:41.697 --> 02:49:43.697
He's mid-talking, he's like, "Well, I--

02:49:44.667 --> 02:49:46.117
"I'm reading a book--"

02:49:47.517 --> 02:49:48.767
LIAM: Did it have any effect?

02:49:49.827 --> 02:49:51.035
MATT: No.
LIAM: No.

02:49:51.035 --> 02:49:51.868
SAM: Damn it.

02:49:53.034 --> 02:49:54.607
MATT: Have to actually trigger
the effect, probably, to do that.

02:49:54.607 --> 02:49:55.565
That'll blow him back.

02:49:56.477 --> 02:49:59.577
Anyway, he goes back up to his balcony to read.

02:49:59.577 --> 02:50:01.157
SAM: Well, we've accomplished all of our business

02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:01.990
in Zadash.

02:50:02.935 --> 02:50:04.432
LAURA: At least we got our blood back. That's good.

02:50:04.432 --> 02:50:06.947
TRAVIS: Yeah. Some good items.
LAURA and MARISHA: And Molly's!

02:50:06.947 --> 02:50:09.687
ASHLEY: Is there any way we can tell if it's--

02:50:09.687 --> 02:50:11.362
TRAVIS: Well, we're going to scry on--

02:50:11.362 --> 02:50:13.187
LAURA: Yeah, which I can do.

02:50:13.187 --> 02:50:15.900
I mean, if we want to hide at a table before we leave

02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:17.405
I could scry on--
SAM: We should.

02:50:17.405 --> 02:50:19.297
There was one other thing that I wrote down

02:50:19.297 --> 02:50:22.387
in my mind that we needed to do in Zadash,

02:50:22.387 --> 02:50:24.127
or that we could do in Zadash.

02:50:24.127 --> 02:50:28.287
I just wrote down "investigate Sutan in Zadash,

02:50:28.287 --> 02:50:30.574
"some ring of fire"? I don't know what that is.

02:50:30.574 --> 02:50:32.989
Is that where you got your ring?

02:50:32.989 --> 02:50:34.247
TRAVIS: The ring of fire was

02:50:35.174 --> 02:50:36.938
it was part of Molly--

02:50:38.817 --> 02:50:39.840
MARISHA: Lord Sutan?

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:42.107
LAURA: What is Sutan?

02:50:42.107 --> 02:50:42.940
SAM: Sutan was--

02:50:42.940 --> 02:50:44.792
MARISHA: Lord Sutan was a dude.

02:50:44.792 --> 02:50:46.167
MATT: That was the house that you broke into.

02:50:46.167 --> 02:50:47.697
LIAM: Yeah, the guy who's life we wrecked.

02:50:47.697 --> 02:50:49.557
TRAVIS: Smothering rug and the--

02:50:49.557 --> 02:50:53.268
MARISHA: Lord Sutan was who you--

02:50:53.268 --> 02:50:56.507
he originally commissioned the ring that you had.

02:50:56.507 --> 02:50:58.757
TRAVIS: The ring of fire resistance.
MATT: He never picked it up, weirdly.

02:50:58.757 --> 02:51:01.660
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Because he's dead.

02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:02.671
MATT: Because he's in prison.

02:51:02.671 --> 02:51:04.262
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Oh. Because of us.

02:51:04.262 --> 02:51:05.520
So we don't have to investigate.

02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:06.854
We know what happened.
MARISHA: Yes.

02:51:06.854 --> 02:51:08.516
SAM: Okay, good. Crossing it off.
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:51:08.516 --> 02:51:10.017
LAURA: Because we killed him.

02:51:10.017 --> 02:51:11.637
Because he's in jail.

02:51:11.637 --> 02:51:12.987
ASHLEY: But I was going to say,

02:51:12.987 --> 02:51:15.832
I wonder if there's any way that we can check

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:19.737
Molly's blood vial and see if it's actually his,

02:51:19.737 --> 02:51:23.817
or if it's actually blood or anything like that, you know?

02:51:23.817 --> 02:51:26.979
SAM: If it came from it an undead person or?

02:51:26.979 --> 02:51:27.857
ASHLEY: I don't know.

02:51:27.857 --> 02:51:29.867
TRAVIS: Would your husband know anything about that?

02:51:29.867 --> 02:51:31.417
SAM: Yes, we could look at it and

02:51:31.417 --> 02:51:32.477
if he could examine it,

02:51:32.477 --> 02:51:34.899
he might be able to see if there's any, you know.

02:51:34.899 --> 02:51:35.732
ASHLEY: Anything special about it?

02:51:35.732 --> 02:51:37.627
LAURA: Do you think it would be dumb

02:51:37.627 --> 02:51:41.867
to scry on Molly's grave?

02:51:41.867 --> 02:51:43.047
MARISHA: To see if he's still there?

02:51:43.047 --> 02:51:47.080
LIAM: I was going to suggest possibly visiting.

02:51:48.317 --> 02:51:51.187
To see if, Caduceus, if you could

02:51:51.187 --> 02:51:53.217
maybe have a conversation.

02:51:53.217 --> 02:51:55.677
MARISHA: It was on the road.

02:51:55.677 --> 02:52:00.357
On the Amber roads.

02:52:00.357 --> 02:52:03.637
TALIESIN: It would be a little rough, but doable.

02:52:03.637 --> 02:52:05.707
LIAM: Do you have a scrap of his coat?

02:52:05.707 --> 02:52:07.617
A piece of his coat, do I remember that correctly?

02:52:07.617 --> 02:52:09.667
MARISHA: And his tarot cards.

02:52:09.667 --> 02:52:11.407
LIAM: Well, if--

02:52:11.407 --> 02:52:13.257
MARISHA: Well, Jester has his tarot cards now.

02:52:13.257 --> 02:52:14.577
LAURA: I can also--

02:52:14.577 --> 02:52:16.468
LIAM: If you have his belongings

02:52:16.468 --> 02:52:19.993
and he is still there,

02:52:19.993 --> 02:52:22.010
I think I could teleport us there.

02:52:24.997 --> 02:52:26.767
But he'd have to be there.

02:52:26.767 --> 02:52:30.407
MARISHA: So what would we want to do with this, though?

02:52:30.407 --> 02:52:31.945
What's the point?

02:52:31.945 --> 02:52:35.697
LIAM: Well, we were very hot to trot to find Cree,

02:52:35.697 --> 02:52:38.397
to ask Cree about all of these connections

02:52:38.397 --> 02:52:40.228
that Molly was wrapped up in.

02:52:40.228 --> 02:52:42.207
LAURA: I don't think I could scry on Molly.

02:52:42.207 --> 02:52:45.277
LIAM: Molly might know, because Molly is dead

02:52:45.277 --> 02:52:48.580
for the second or third or fourth or fifth time.

02:52:50.517 --> 02:52:52.377
SAM: Yup, yup, yup.

02:52:52.377 --> 02:52:54.907
LIAM: Who's to say what's inside that skull?

02:52:54.907 --> 02:52:56.837
SAM: And if Caduceus does the asking,

02:52:56.837 --> 02:52:57.867
maybe we could

02:52:58.877 --> 02:53:01.940
step back if it's too painful for us to, you know,

02:53:03.251 --> 02:53:05.872
to witness or anything, you know?

02:53:05.872 --> 02:53:08.707
Caduceus could just have a one on one conversation

02:53:08.707 --> 02:53:10.457
with Mollymauk.

02:53:10.457 --> 02:53:12.577
TRAVIS: It's viable, but we should probably

02:53:12.577 --> 02:53:16.877
go after Cree first and then Molly's grave, yeah?

02:53:16.877 --> 02:53:18.240
MARISHA: I just-- he didn't--

02:53:19.208 --> 02:53:21.527
Caduceus, you know about this?

02:53:21.527 --> 02:53:24.027
When you speak with the dead, they can really only

02:53:25.278 --> 02:53:27.114
speak what they know in time?

02:53:27.114 --> 02:53:28.739
TALIESIN: Yeah, they're not there or anything.

02:53:28.739 --> 02:53:30.454
They're gone.

02:53:30.454 --> 02:53:32.705
TRAVIS: And they can choose to
not tell you the truth, right?

02:53:32.705 --> 02:53:35.317
MARISHA: Right.
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

02:53:35.317 --> 02:53:37.737
It's complicated.

02:53:37.737 --> 02:53:39.477
It's not even that they can choose

02:53:39.477 --> 02:53:40.617
not to tell you the truth.

02:53:40.617 --> 02:53:42.590
It's more of would they have.

02:53:43.857 --> 02:53:45.620
That choice is gone.

02:53:47.027 --> 02:53:51.967
You can baffle what's there, but it's not--

02:53:51.967 --> 02:53:53.897
it's not a person.

02:53:53.897 --> 02:53:56.764
LIAM: I have a foolish question, perhaps,

02:53:56.764 --> 02:53:59.013
but for both of you.

02:53:59.013 --> 02:54:01.317
Jester, you only just asked me about

02:54:03.247 --> 02:54:07.117
potentially bringing my mother and father back.

02:54:07.117 --> 02:54:10.412
While not possible because we have no--

02:54:11.537 --> 02:54:13.517
Well, it's not possible.

02:54:13.517 --> 02:54:16.380
But if he still lies at rest where we left him,

02:54:18.319 --> 02:54:19.847
is it possible?

02:54:19.847 --> 02:54:21.097
LAURA: I could bring him back.

02:54:28.224 --> 02:54:31.057
LIAM: Who wants to go visit Mollymauk?

02:54:32.247 --> 02:54:34.967
LAURA: Should I scry on Cree first?

02:54:34.967 --> 02:54:35.877
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:54:35.877 --> 02:54:37.385
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: Sure.

02:54:37.385 --> 02:54:38.460
MARISHA: One hundred percent.

02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:39.807
SAM: Is that your only scry for the day?

02:54:39.807 --> 02:54:41.117
Because we all might also want to look

02:54:41.117 --> 02:54:41.994
at Mollymauk's grave before we go.

02:54:41.994 --> 02:54:44.507
LAURA: I can't scry on Molly's grave, I was wrong.

02:54:44.507 --> 02:54:46.207
I can't scry on a location.

02:54:46.207 --> 02:54:48.777
It has to be a living creature.

02:54:48.777 --> 02:54:51.296
MATT: Well, actually that's not true.

02:54:51.296 --> 02:54:52.629
LAURA: No?

02:54:52.629 --> 02:54:53.462
MATT: I don't think so.

02:54:53.462 --> 02:54:54.627
LIAM: What's that, Gentleman?

02:54:56.947 --> 02:55:00.295
(as The Gentleman) "Before you leave,
I couldn't help but overhear--"

02:55:00.295 --> 02:55:02.279
(laughter)

02:55:02.279 --> 02:55:03.820
TALIESIN: (as The Gentleman) "Excuse me,
I couldn't help but overhear

02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:05.407
"you talking about scrying."

02:55:05.407 --> 02:55:07.609
TRAVIS: Oh, your real blood vials are rattling.

02:55:07.609 --> 02:55:09.627
LAURA: I always forget that last little paragraph.

02:55:09.627 --> 02:55:10.977
MATT: Yeah, (reading) "instead of targeting a creature,

02:55:10.977 --> 02:55:12.837
"you can choose a location you've seen before

02:55:12.837 --> 02:55:14.314
"as the target of the spell."

02:55:14.314 --> 02:55:15.560
LAURA: Okay, so I could.

02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:17.817
But no, I can do it multiple times a day.

02:55:17.817 --> 02:55:20.887
I just can't do it on the same person multiple times a day.

02:55:20.887 --> 02:55:21.720
MATT: Correct.

02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:23.639
SAM: So I guess Cree?

02:55:23.639 --> 02:55:26.467
LAURA: Cree first.
MARISHA: (chanting) Cree first, Cree first.

02:55:26.467 --> 02:55:31.280
LAURA: Okay, so I've met Cree, so it should be easier to do.

02:55:32.407 --> 02:55:33.937
MATT: In theory.

02:55:33.937 --> 02:55:34.960
LAURA: Firsthand.

02:55:37.007 --> 02:55:38.520
I have met the target.

02:55:39.937 --> 02:55:40.770
MATT: Indeed.

02:55:43.870 --> 02:55:44.987
What's the spell DC?

02:55:47.137 --> 02:55:48.660
LAURA: 18.
MATT: 18.

02:55:52.762 --> 02:55:56.399
Give me just a second. I have to go
look up an NPC character sheet.

02:55:56.399 --> 02:55:58.052
TRAVIS: Oh god, yeah. No doubt.

02:55:58.052 --> 02:55:59.049
TALIESIN: So terrified.

02:55:59.049 --> 02:56:00.374
TRAVIS: From way back.

02:56:01.718 --> 02:56:02.613
A year plus.

02:56:02.613 --> 02:56:04.180
MATT: Just a moment.

02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:05.937
MARISHA: What are you-- Oh, looking up her character sheet?

02:56:05.937 --> 02:56:08.507
MATT: Yeah, looking for the wisdom save.

02:56:08.507 --> 02:56:12.422
TRAVIS: Are we really entertaining bringing back Molly?

02:56:12.422 --> 02:56:13.716
SAM: I fucking love it.

02:56:16.078 --> 02:56:17.642
TRAVIS: Is that what we're talking about?

02:56:17.642 --> 02:56:19.361
SAM: I fucking love it.

02:56:19.361 --> 02:56:21.627
ASHLEY: Man, oh man, oh man.

02:56:21.627 --> 02:56:22.837
SAM: Danger.

02:56:22.837 --> 02:56:24.501
TALIESIN: I know all the ways that can get weird.

02:56:24.501 --> 02:56:25.384
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:56:26.615 --> 02:56:27.448
MATT: As you

02:56:30.207 --> 02:56:31.697
sit there.

02:56:31.697 --> 02:56:33.587
Are you doing this in the middle of--

02:56:33.587 --> 02:56:35.227
LAURA: No, I'm going to find a little,

02:56:35.227 --> 02:56:38.137
little table off to the side in the shadows.

02:56:38.137 --> 02:56:41.062
MATT: Okay, all right.
So you focus and concentrate.

02:56:41.062 --> 02:56:42.527
As you put your hands down--

02:56:42.527 --> 02:56:46.357
LAURA: I'll draw dicks in the gross smudges on the tables.

02:56:46.357 --> 02:56:49.230
MATT: The dicks alight with divine energy.

02:56:50.157 --> 02:56:53.187
And as you close your eyes,

02:56:53.187 --> 02:56:54.727
you feel a pair of hands

02:56:54.727 --> 02:56:56.537
just gently touch your chin

02:56:56.537 --> 02:57:00.067
and move it upward towards the sky and the voice says,

02:57:00.067 --> 02:57:02.717
"Well, let's see if we can find your quarry."

02:57:04.076 --> 02:57:06.686
As you close your eyes, you feel your vision

02:57:06.686 --> 02:57:09.347
push through the ground through the stone, up into the sky,

02:57:09.347 --> 02:57:13.677
the clouds, the thick clouds into rainstorms,

02:57:13.677 --> 02:57:17.447
into heavy, heavier clouds and to just moving through

02:57:17.447 --> 02:57:20.147
thick weather and sky.

02:57:20.147 --> 02:57:21.267
And then you come down

02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:25.116
and there is

02:57:25.116 --> 02:57:26.965
heavy snow.

02:57:26.965 --> 02:57:28.645
<i>Heavy</i>, heavy snow.

02:57:30.847 --> 02:57:32.170
There is, like, a,

02:57:33.247 --> 02:57:36.067
it's just white around you.

02:57:36.067 --> 02:57:39.697
It's hard to

02:57:39.697 --> 02:57:42.144
make out more detail beyond you than just this bluster.

02:57:42.144 --> 02:57:45.747
And you see Cree heavily bundled up with a fur hood

02:57:45.747 --> 02:57:48.817
and a coat with thick leathers and hides

02:57:48.817 --> 02:57:50.625
with a bundle and a pack on the back just

02:57:50.625 --> 02:57:54.013
(heavy breathing).

02:57:54.013 --> 02:57:56.929
Looks like she's trudging through some heavy weather.

02:57:56.929 --> 02:57:59.117
LAURA: Does it seem like Cree is with anyone else

02:57:59.117 --> 02:58:00.797
that I can see through the snow flurry?

02:58:00.797 --> 02:58:01.767
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:58:01.767 --> 02:58:05.447
You are in a very, you're in a very--

02:58:05.447 --> 02:58:06.465
TRAVIS: Blizzard?

02:58:06.465 --> 02:58:09.233
MATT: Well, it's a heavy blizzard and it's a tight scry.

02:58:09.233 --> 02:58:10.757
You can only really can see the individual.

02:58:10.757 --> 02:58:14.247
And you can barely make out very basic details.

02:58:14.247 --> 02:58:15.377
It'd be be pretty close for you to get anything,

02:58:15.377 --> 02:58:17.547
but roll super high and we'll see,.

02:58:17.547 --> 02:58:18.414
SAM: I bless you.

02:58:19.464 --> 02:58:20.381
MATT: Too late.

02:58:21.614 --> 02:58:23.223
LAURA: And I can't guide myself when I'm doing it.

02:58:23.223 --> 02:58:24.056
MATT: Nope.

02:58:25.474 --> 02:58:27.937
LAURA: Perception, 14.

02:58:27.937 --> 02:58:30.337
MATT: 14, too much heavy weather

02:58:30.337 --> 02:58:32.464
and the confines of the spell.

02:58:32.464 --> 02:58:35.897
But you see Cree trudging through.

02:58:35.897 --> 02:58:39.257
You see the black tabaxi fur and the breath

02:58:41.027 --> 02:58:43.780
escaping with each exhale and just kind of, you know,

02:58:45.077 --> 02:58:47.944
physical exertion going through a harsh environment.

02:58:47.944 --> 02:58:50.387
LAURA: With that perception could I see what the pack

02:58:50.387 --> 02:58:51.580
on the back is?

02:58:52.527 --> 02:58:55.277
MATT: You can see there is a thick leather pack,

02:58:55.277 --> 02:58:56.637
but you don't see anything in it.

02:58:56.637 --> 02:58:58.134
LAURA: Like anything in it.

02:58:58.134 --> 02:59:00.480
SAM: Is that a coincidence?
LAURA: No way.

02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:02.012
TRAVIS: No, could be anywhere.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:59:02.012 --> 02:59:04.711
SAM: Episode title: Good Kitties and Bad Cats.

02:59:04.711 --> 02:59:07.528
(laughter)

02:59:10.320 --> 02:59:12.828
MATT: And then after a moment of watching,

02:59:12.828 --> 02:59:14.307
you pull yourself back

02:59:14.307 --> 02:59:17.887
and you feel a bit colder, even just being in that vision,

02:59:17.887 --> 02:59:19.507
but cold doesn't have a huge effect on you, anyway.

02:59:19.507 --> 02:59:20.927
So you shrug it off.

02:59:20.927 --> 02:59:23.487
And you all watch as Jester goes from her

02:59:23.487 --> 02:59:26.107
upturned focus, the eyes somewhat glazed over

02:59:26.107 --> 02:59:28.417
and milky storm white.

02:59:28.417 --> 02:59:31.140
And then she comes back into herself.

02:59:32.787 --> 02:59:34.383
LAURA: Cree's in the snow.

02:59:34.383 --> 02:59:37.512
SAM: But any distinguishing details or just white?

02:59:37.512 --> 02:59:39.165
Like, any mountain tops?

02:59:39.165 --> 02:59:43.677
LAURA: Super duper thick, white snow everywhere.

02:59:43.677 --> 02:59:45.310
Major winter storm.

02:59:45.310 --> 02:59:46.477
MATT: Not unlike the

02:59:47.555 --> 02:59:50.189
the snow you encountered around Uthodurn.

02:59:50.189 --> 02:59:52.869
LAURA: Not unlike the snow we encountered around Uthodurn.

02:59:52.869 --> 02:59:53.794
SAM: Okay.

02:59:55.497 --> 02:59:57.813
So maybe Greying Wildlands or something?

02:59:57.813 --> 03:00:00.714
MARISHA: No, she's heading north. She's got to be heading

03:00:00.714 --> 03:00:02.757
to Aeor.
TRAVIS: There's no way.

03:00:02.757 --> 03:00:05.437
SAM: How would that have any connection?

03:00:05.437 --> 03:00:07.225
LAURA: Oh, I run in and ask my dad before we leave.

03:00:07.225 --> 03:00:08.058
MATT: Yeah.

03:00:08.058 --> 03:00:09.717
LAURA: So you said there's been

03:00:09.717 --> 03:00:14.717
a bunch of artifacts coming down from the north, right?

03:00:14.837 --> 03:00:17.012
MATT: "Yes, they usually come through Shadycreek

03:00:17.012 --> 03:00:18.587
"and some of the contacts there.

03:00:18.587 --> 03:00:20.527
"You met Ophelia, actually."

03:00:20.527 --> 03:00:21.600
LAURA: Oh, right.

03:00:22.497 --> 03:00:24.946
I didn't meet Ophelia, did I?

03:00:24.946 --> 03:00:25.839
SAM: Oh, you didn't.
LAURA: I didn't.

03:00:25.839 --> 03:00:27.880
MATT: On the way back. You guys traveled back with Ophelia

03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:29.782
to bring her to The Gentleman. That was part of the return.

03:00:29.782 --> 03:00:31.977
MARISHA: We erased Ophelia. Is Ophelia here?

03:00:31.977 --> 03:00:34.005
MATT: "No, no she returned to Shadycreek."

03:00:34.005 --> 03:00:35.130
LAURA: That bitch.

03:00:37.717 --> 03:00:40.942
I didn't like her, I didn't like her. Anyway.

03:00:40.942 --> 03:00:42.827
MATT: "You have reasons. I have reasons not to like her,

03:00:42.827 --> 03:00:45.642
"but she is a good business contact."

03:00:45.642 --> 03:00:46.917
LAURA: Sure.

03:00:46.917 --> 03:00:48.852
Anyway, so you said all those artifacts

03:00:48.852 --> 03:00:50.469
were coming down from the north.

03:00:50.469 --> 03:00:51.647
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

03:00:51.647 --> 03:00:53.647
LAURA: How long ago did they start coming down?

03:00:56.347 --> 03:00:58.307
MATT: "I mean, the first whispers were

03:01:00.067 --> 03:01:02.217
"seven, eight years ago.

03:01:02.217 --> 03:01:05.807
"And just been steadily growing since."

03:01:05.807 --> 03:01:06.907
LAURA: Did anything major come through

03:01:06.907 --> 03:01:08.857
like three months ago before Cree left?

03:01:09.797 --> 03:01:11.797
Anything that you can think of?

03:01:14.297 --> 03:01:17.434
MATT: "Not specifically to Zadash, no."

03:01:17.434 --> 03:01:18.497
LAURA: Mmkay.

03:01:20.355 --> 03:01:21.601
All right, thank you.

03:01:21.601 --> 03:01:22.784
MATT: "No worries."

03:01:25.834 --> 03:01:27.359
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: I can't concentrate.

03:01:27.359 --> 03:01:28.886
Are we really-- are we talking about this?

03:01:28.886 --> 03:01:30.874
Are we going to visit Molly's grave?

03:01:30.874 --> 03:01:31.873
MARISHA: Well, scry--
LAURA: I know, that's--

03:01:31.873 --> 03:01:34.377
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Scry first.

03:01:34.377 --> 03:01:36.317
MARISHA: If if he's still-- If it's undisturbed,

03:01:36.317 --> 03:01:37.267
I don't know.

03:01:37.267 --> 03:01:38.797
I don't know what we could get out of it,

03:01:38.797 --> 03:01:40.537
to be totally honest.

03:01:40.537 --> 03:01:42.849
LAURA: I know it feels, wrong.
LIAM: If he's still--

03:01:42.849 --> 03:01:45.246
SAM: Jack Nicholson nod.

03:01:45.246 --> 03:01:48.757
(laughter)

03:01:48.757 --> 03:01:50.857
LIAM: You don't know what we could get out of it?

03:01:50.857 --> 03:01:52.697
We are grasping at straws

03:01:52.697 --> 03:01:55.645
trying to understand connections we cannot fully see.

03:01:55.645 --> 03:01:58.320
LAURA: Did you find anything else from the library?

03:02:00.137 --> 03:02:01.743
MARISHA: Kind of.

03:02:01.743 --> 03:02:03.624
Just further confirmation.

03:02:03.624 --> 03:02:06.147
LIAM: Just reason to visit Mollymauk.

03:02:06.147 --> 03:02:08.700
MARISHA: But Mollymauk didn't know anything.

03:02:09.657 --> 03:02:11.117
<i>Cree</i> knew things.

03:02:11.117 --> 03:02:14.577
What we need to do is find other people from the order

03:02:14.577 --> 03:02:16.045
that Mollymauk belonged to.

03:02:16.045 --> 03:02:19.497
LIAM: Mollymauk didn't know anything,
but <i>Nonagon</i> might have.

03:02:19.497 --> 03:02:20.987
LIAM: And it's the same person.

03:02:20.987 --> 03:02:23.387
MARISHA: But how does that work once they're dead?

03:02:23.387 --> 03:02:26.777
LIAM: We don't know unless we try, Beauregard.

03:02:26.777 --> 03:02:30.516
TRAVIS: You might get user one,
user two, or the admin profile.

03:02:30.516 --> 03:02:33.847
MARISHA: But do we have to dig out our friend?

03:02:33.847 --> 03:02:36.014
(laughter)

03:02:38.637 --> 03:02:39.687
LIAM: Fuck, that was good.

03:02:43.207 --> 03:02:44.407
SAM: Where'd my desktop go?

03:02:45.297 --> 03:02:46.547
Oh, it's the wrong guy.

03:02:48.077 --> 03:02:51.337
LIAM: I don't know, but I could
have us there in under a minute.

03:02:51.337 --> 03:02:52.891
MARISHA: Well, let's scry on his grave first.

03:02:52.891 --> 03:02:55.507
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

03:02:55.507 --> 03:02:56.340
All right.

03:02:57.937 --> 03:03:02.630
I'm going to add a couple archways to the dicks.

03:03:03.979 --> 03:03:05.507
And then I'm going to do it again.

03:03:05.507 --> 03:03:06.340
MATT: Okay.

03:03:07.577 --> 03:03:09.547
Once again, the little dicks flair

03:03:10.679 --> 03:03:12.187
at the corners of the table.

03:03:13.937 --> 03:03:15.213
LIAM: Getting ready, Taliesin?

03:03:15.213 --> 03:03:17.737
MATT: You close your eyes and your head

03:03:17.737 --> 03:03:18.577
tips upward once more.

03:03:18.577 --> 03:03:20.077
And you feel yourself being lifted as if

03:03:20.077 --> 03:03:21.987
the Traveler's arms come under your arms,

03:03:21.987 --> 03:03:23.697
much like you were holding up Luc

03:03:23.697 --> 03:03:26.647
in The Invulnerable Vagrant, and then feel your essence

03:03:26.647 --> 03:03:28.337
pulled out into the sky.

03:03:28.337 --> 03:03:31.067
Once again, hitting clouds and weather.

03:03:31.067 --> 03:03:33.277
And then you come down upon an edge of the road,

03:03:33.277 --> 03:03:36.847
not far from the Crispvale Roadway.

03:03:36.847 --> 03:03:40.317
And you see a patch not far from a number of hills

03:03:40.317 --> 03:03:41.427
that are unfamiliar to you

03:03:41.427 --> 03:03:43.077
beyond the journey back home.

03:03:43.077 --> 03:03:45.937
And the stop you briefly had at the grave site.

03:03:45.937 --> 03:03:47.467
It is pouring rain.

03:03:47.467 --> 03:03:50.167
The ground is just mud

03:03:50.167 --> 03:03:52.777
and you can glance down and you can see

03:03:53.719 --> 03:03:58.719
the stick that marked his grave tilted to the side.

03:04:00.227 --> 03:04:02.377
No sign of the coat at the moment,

03:04:02.377 --> 03:04:04.967
but it's been left to the, you know,

03:04:04.967 --> 03:04:07.597
the elements of nature for weeks and weeks and weeks

03:04:07.597 --> 03:04:09.197
and weeks and months and months.

03:04:10.047 --> 03:04:14.277
But it's just a muddy portion of ground with,

03:04:14.277 --> 03:04:17.607
you know, nothing real distinguishing in sight.

03:04:17.607 --> 03:04:19.397
LAURA: The stick is still there?

03:04:19.397 --> 03:04:20.727
MATT: It's there, it's just at an angle.

03:04:20.727 --> 03:04:22.650
TRAVIS: No hole?
LIAM: No tunnels out of the earth?

03:04:22.650 --> 03:04:24.437
MARISHA: No disturbed ground?

03:04:24.437 --> 03:04:25.737
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:04:26.877 --> 03:04:29.422
LAURA: One of these days, Laura.

03:04:29.422 --> 03:04:31.364
LIAM: One of these days, Alice.

03:04:32.917 --> 03:04:35.157
LAURA: 15.
MATT: 15?

03:04:35.157 --> 03:04:37.427
It's hard to tell. I mean,

03:04:37.427 --> 03:04:40.257
any grave site that's been here for months at a time

03:04:40.257 --> 03:04:42.777
through the weather that comes through the Empire,

03:04:42.777 --> 03:04:44.417
especially the northern side of it.

03:04:44.417 --> 03:04:46.407
There's erosion and--

03:04:46.407 --> 03:04:48.297
or not necessarily erosion, it was more like

03:04:48.297 --> 03:04:50.707
there's constantly mixing mud and dirt

03:04:50.707 --> 03:04:53.357
and snowfall that then comes and melts

03:04:53.357 --> 03:04:55.157
and changes the landscape a bit.

03:04:55.157 --> 03:04:57.817
You can't tell if it's been disturbed or not.

03:04:57.817 --> 03:04:59.757
All you see is that it is the same location.

03:04:59.757 --> 03:05:03.570
You don't see an open hole, anything like that.

03:05:04.927 --> 03:05:05.760
LAURA: Okay.

03:05:07.247 --> 03:05:08.497
TALIESIN: #LeaveNoTrace.

03:05:10.168 --> 03:05:12.080
TRAVIS: Nice, nice.
TALIESIN: That was for you.

03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:12.913
TRAVIS: Appropriate.

03:05:14.219 --> 03:05:15.821
MARISHA: All right.

03:05:15.821 --> 03:05:17.020
SAM: Let's go.

03:05:17.020 --> 03:05:18.357
MARISHA: Here's what I think.

03:05:18.357 --> 03:05:19.497
LIAM: Even if he's not there,

03:05:19.497 --> 03:05:22.357
it's worth it to try to see if he is there.

03:05:22.357 --> 03:05:25.757
And with his tarot cards, I can get us there.

03:05:25.757 --> 03:05:27.877
LAURA: With his tarot cards would you get us there,

03:05:27.877 --> 03:05:30.207
or would you get us to his body?

03:05:30.207 --> 03:05:32.807
LIAM: Well, that's interesting.

03:05:32.807 --> 03:05:36.660
Because if he's in the ground that will get us there.

03:05:37.827 --> 03:05:39.407
It could get a little hinky

03:05:39.407 --> 03:05:41.707
if I tried to go to that location.

03:05:41.707 --> 03:05:45.377
I'm trying to go to that location, not his body, per se,

03:05:45.377 --> 03:05:47.287
but the cards would help.

03:05:47.287 --> 03:05:48.717
So it's a little bit of an X factor.

03:05:48.717 --> 03:05:50.137
MATT: It's a destination you select.

03:05:50.137 --> 03:05:51.240
So it is a location.

03:05:52.467 --> 03:05:56.127
SAM: So we don't necessarily need
to land on his body, right?

03:05:56.127 --> 03:05:59.467
Like, right, we can go near it or?

03:05:59.467 --> 03:06:01.287
MATT: Well, no, meaning when you choose to teleport,

03:06:01.287 --> 03:06:04.287
you don't teleport to a person,
you teleport to a location.

03:06:04.287 --> 03:06:06.257
LIAM: Yeah, yeah I was just trying to focus on having

03:06:06.257 --> 03:06:07.937
an object from location because that makes it

03:06:07.937 --> 03:06:10.807
a hundred percent success. There's no risk to it.

03:06:10.807 --> 03:06:13.898
MATT: Correct, so the coat element there

03:06:13.898 --> 03:06:16.589
technically was retrieved at that location.

03:06:16.589 --> 03:06:19.357
So the piece that she has would make it

03:06:19.357 --> 03:06:20.227
a near perfect--

03:06:20.227 --> 03:06:21.767
SAM: Oh, great.
LIAM: Okay, great.

03:06:21.767 --> 03:06:24.048
MARISHA: Here's what I think.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:06:24.048 --> 03:06:27.647
MARISHA: Deal with me for a moment, conspiracy theory-style.

03:06:27.647 --> 03:06:29.160
All right, here's what we know.

03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:33.017
TRAVIS: Insert voiceover.

03:06:33.017 --> 03:06:36.723
MARISHA: Yes, cue montage. Yes.

03:06:36.723 --> 03:06:38.981
SAM: (peppy montage music)

03:06:40.517 --> 03:06:41.353
MARISHA: Okay.

03:06:41.353 --> 03:06:44.129
TRAVIS: (peppy montage music)

03:06:44.129 --> 03:06:45.544
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

03:06:45.544 --> 03:06:47.570
From what we've heard--
TRAVIS: Commit.

03:06:48.687 --> 03:06:50.067
MARISHA: Goddamn it. Okay, I'm going to try--

03:06:50.067 --> 03:06:51.747
I'm trying to piece everything together here.

03:06:51.747 --> 03:06:54.467
Okay, okay, okay. So.
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

03:06:54.467 --> 03:06:55.550
MARISHA: Vess DeRogna.

03:06:58.882 --> 03:07:01.017
Vess DeRogna is sending us off to Aeor.

03:07:01.017 --> 03:07:04.937
We know that she is in search of these divine artifacts.

03:07:04.937 --> 03:07:07.917
When I researched at the Cobalt Reserve,

03:07:07.917 --> 03:07:11.950
if they had any artifacts from Aeor,

03:07:11.950 --> 03:07:15.847
they said no, that they had none in possession,

03:07:15.847 --> 03:07:18.597
that they all belonged to the Cerberus Assembly.

03:07:18.597 --> 03:07:19.807
They had all of them.

03:07:19.807 --> 03:07:22.847
They also confirmed that there has been trades

03:07:22.847 --> 03:07:27.847
of these artifacts coming from the north in recent times.

03:07:28.267 --> 03:07:33.040
So we have Mollymauk, who is a part of the Tomb Takers.

03:07:35.107 --> 03:07:38.877
And from what we know of the Tomb Takers,

03:07:38.877 --> 03:07:42.097
and what I just researched from the Cobalt Reserve

03:07:42.097 --> 03:07:45.527
is that they were also doing things like

03:07:45.527 --> 03:07:49.487
thieving, body guard missions, excavating

03:07:49.487 --> 03:07:54.317
exactly what Vess DeRogna just hired us to do for her.

03:07:54.317 --> 03:07:57.257
And that they were being sent to places

03:07:57.257 --> 03:07:59.817
like Molaesmyr and Shattengrod

03:07:59.817 --> 03:08:04.802
all pre-Calamity cities with pre-Calamity artifacts.

03:08:04.802 --> 03:08:06.077
all pre-Calamity cities with pre-Calamity artifacts.

03:08:06.077 --> 03:08:11.057
We then learned that Cree confirmed that Lucien

03:08:11.057 --> 03:08:15.677
and the Tomb Takers were running from a spell slinger

03:08:15.677 --> 03:08:19.657
from the capital chasing after this book.

03:08:19.657 --> 03:08:23.777
So there was some sort of book involved in this--

03:08:23.777 --> 03:08:25.085
what is-- what is happening?

03:08:25.085 --> 03:08:27.985
MATT: It's a picture of Charlie Day
with his conspiracy board.

03:08:29.038 --> 03:08:31.871
TALIESIN: We were all thinking it.
MARISHA: I know!

03:08:32.922 --> 03:08:34.272
I have all of my books out.

03:08:36.577 --> 03:08:38.733
Okay.
LAURA: So the Tomb Takers, wait,

03:08:38.733 --> 03:08:41.277
the Tomb Takers took the book from Vess?

03:08:41.277 --> 03:08:43.927
MARISHA: Yes, so I think that the spell slinger

03:08:43.927 --> 03:08:45.307
from the capital that they were running from

03:08:45.307 --> 03:08:48.147
was definitely Vess DeRogna who had something to do

03:08:48.147 --> 03:08:50.877
with this book and this ritual.

03:08:50.877 --> 03:08:54.077
So Molly was also a part of some sort of order

03:08:54.077 --> 03:08:57.707
before the Tomb Takers and Molly was like

03:08:57.707 --> 03:08:59.117
the leader, right?

03:08:59.117 --> 03:09:00.307
And branched off and was like,

03:09:00.307 --> 03:09:02.490
fuck this other unnamed order.

03:09:03.527 --> 03:09:05.887
Let's go and be the Tomb Takers.

03:09:05.887 --> 03:09:08.387
And then when we saw Cree and Cree was rambling

03:09:08.387 --> 03:09:09.787
about the ritual Cree was like,

03:09:09.787 --> 03:09:11.777
"Oh we didn't, you were doing all these things

03:09:11.777 --> 03:09:14.047
"and you were so great." Remember Cree was like

03:09:14.047 --> 03:09:17.067
"Oh, Molly, oh," like he was a fucking cult leader

03:09:17.067 --> 03:09:19.667
because he was definitely a cult leader and

03:09:21.527 --> 03:09:24.427
mentioned that when he volunteered for the ritual

03:09:24.427 --> 03:09:27.857
and things went haywire

03:09:27.857 --> 03:09:29.651
that they were instructed to run.

03:09:29.651 --> 03:09:32.343
So I think

03:09:33.287 --> 03:09:36.237
the Tomb Takers, who worked out of Shadycreek Run,

03:09:36.237 --> 03:09:39.137
who isn't, which isn't far from Shattengrod,

03:09:39.137 --> 03:09:40.245
Shattengrod?

03:09:40.245 --> 03:09:43.487
Shattengrod.
MATT: It's a bit, yeah.

03:09:43.487 --> 03:09:45.393
LIAM: Just think <i>schadenfreude</i>.

03:09:45.393 --> 03:09:46.307
MARISHA: Not far.
LIAM: Shattengrod.

03:09:46.307 --> 03:09:48.667
MARISHA: I think they were a previous mercenary group

03:09:48.667 --> 03:09:51.807
hired by Vess DeRogna to do some sort of

03:09:51.807 --> 03:09:56.667
excavation mission either in Molaesmyr or Shattengrod.

03:09:56.667 --> 03:10:00.402
They got looped into whatever crazy shit

03:10:00.402 --> 03:10:01.947
that Vess DeRogna wants to figure out

03:10:01.947 --> 03:10:05.570
with this pre-Calamity weaponry that destroys divinity.

03:10:06.487 --> 03:10:10.427
And he was the person for the ritual.

03:10:10.427 --> 03:10:12.320
What I think the ritual was for.

03:10:13.457 --> 03:10:14.619
Bear with me for a second.

03:10:14.619 --> 03:10:16.747
TRAVIS: This is so Clue movie.

03:10:16.747 --> 03:10:18.413
MATT: Oh yeah.
LIAM: One plus one plus two plus one.

03:10:18.413 --> 03:10:21.367
TALIESIN: I want to see Gene Wilder do this so badly.

03:10:21.367 --> 03:10:22.691
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: Who are you, Perry Mason?

03:10:22.691 --> 03:10:24.341
TRAVIS: She ran in here.

03:10:24.341 --> 03:10:26.582
MARISHA: Because, hang on wait, wait.

03:10:26.582 --> 03:10:28.230
Where's my, this is--

03:10:28.230 --> 03:10:29.211
TRAVIS: Turned off the lights.

03:10:29.211 --> 03:10:30.413
MARISHA: Let me get this out of the way.

03:10:31.133 --> 03:10:33.193
MARISHA: So they stole the book. They were running from a--

03:10:34.701 --> 03:10:35.909
They thought he was going to come back.

03:10:35.909 --> 03:10:38.217
So what if

03:10:39.561 --> 03:10:44.521
they thought they were teleporting Molly to Aeor?

03:10:44.521 --> 03:10:46.971
And they were assuming that Aeor

03:10:46.971 --> 03:10:49.507
was still in this dimension,

03:10:50.381 --> 03:10:52.741
but what if Aeor isn't in this dimension?

03:10:52.741 --> 03:10:53.574
TRAVIS: Whoa.

03:10:53.574 --> 03:10:55.014
MARISHA: Like we talked about before,

03:10:56.831 --> 03:10:59.631
because the Cobalt Soul

03:10:59.631 --> 03:11:01.641
said that

03:11:01.641 --> 03:11:05.601
there are no reported survivors from Aeor.

03:11:05.601 --> 03:11:08.871
Also, in all of the language that Vess DeRogna

03:11:08.871 --> 03:11:11.591
and the Cobalt Soul used,

03:11:11.591 --> 03:11:14.501
they mentioned that we were heading to an excavation site

03:11:14.501 --> 03:11:17.894
that they <i>believe</i> Aeor is located,

03:11:19.031 --> 03:11:21.811
but no confirmation that there is Aeor there.

03:11:21.811 --> 03:11:23.351
So what if it's not there?

03:11:23.351 --> 03:11:25.901
And also there were no reported survivors.

03:11:25.901 --> 03:11:28.811
So they think that Aeor is here,

03:11:28.811 --> 03:11:30.441
but also no reported survivors,

03:11:30.441 --> 03:11:33.191
so what if it's not here anymore?

03:11:33.191 --> 03:11:34.561
And it's the city

03:11:35.484 --> 03:11:36.436
in the Abyss?

03:11:36.436 --> 03:11:38.311
LAURA: What if the city is the weapon?

03:11:38.311 --> 03:11:40.760
The city devours divinity.

03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:42.231
MARISHA: That could be it.

03:11:42.231 --> 03:11:43.643
And what if--
LIAM: Question.

03:11:43.643 --> 03:11:45.471
MARISHA: Hang on! I'm almost done.
LIAM: Question.

03:11:45.471 --> 03:11:47.503
MARISHA: What if Molly was,

03:11:47.503 --> 03:11:51.034
instead of teleported to Aeor, was telepated--

03:11:51.034 --> 03:11:53.609
teleported-- to this insane--
LAURA: Twitterpated.

03:11:53.609 --> 03:11:55.036
MARISHA: -- was twitterpated

03:11:55.036 --> 03:11:57.811
to the city in the Abyss?

03:11:57.811 --> 03:12:00.271
And then because when he came out of the grave,

03:12:00.271 --> 03:12:03.361
he had nine tattoo eyes, nine eyes,

03:12:03.361 --> 03:12:06.912
nine tattoos of eyes,
LIAM: On his body. Right.

03:12:06.912 --> 03:12:08.062
MARISHA: On his body.

03:12:09.851 --> 03:12:11.201
And then he didn't remember anything.

03:12:11.201 --> 03:12:13.081
And then everything went shitty, and then he didn't want to

03:12:13.081 --> 03:12:14.086
know anything about his past life.

03:12:14.086 --> 03:12:15.649
LAURA: And he was empty.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:15.649 --> 03:12:17.431
LIAM: I definitely think you've got it surrounded.

03:12:17.431 --> 03:12:18.936
Question.
MARISHA: Yes.

03:12:18.936 --> 03:12:20.416
LIAM: You've talked about--
MARISHA: I'm sweaty now.

03:12:20.416 --> 03:12:22.044
LIAM: You're like The Gentleman.

03:12:22.044 --> 03:12:23.581
MARISHA: Both Beau and Marisha.

03:12:23.581 --> 03:12:24.614
LIAM: You are like The Gentleman.

03:12:24.614 --> 03:12:25.839
MARISHA: Yes.

03:12:25.839 --> 03:12:27.591
(laughter)

03:12:27.591 --> 03:12:29.231
LIAM: We also know for six or seven years, though,

03:12:29.231 --> 03:12:32.531
that artifacts from pre-Calamity times have been coming

03:12:32.531 --> 03:12:36.872
south and into the possession of the Assembly.

03:12:36.872 --> 03:12:37.714
MARISHA: Okay!

03:12:37.714 --> 03:12:40.880
LIAM: Those would have come from Aeor.

03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:41.771
MARISHA: Not necessarily,

03:12:41.771 --> 03:12:44.746
because there's also Shattengrod and--

03:12:44.746 --> 03:12:46.425
LIAM: They were coming down from the north.

03:12:46.425 --> 03:12:48.431
TALIESIN: What if--
MARISHA: And Molaesmyr.

03:12:48.431 --> 03:12:52.051
But there's lots of other pre-Calamity city sites

03:12:52.051 --> 03:12:53.829
that it could have potentially come from.

03:12:53.829 --> 03:12:56.421
MATT: Some aren't pre-Calamity, like Molaesmyr,

03:12:56.421 --> 03:12:58.386
which is the elven city that

03:12:59.816 --> 03:13:02.458
essentially corrupted the entire Savalirwood

03:13:02.458 --> 03:13:03.471
with its destruction,

03:13:03.471 --> 03:13:06.531
and a lot of the Shadycreek Run does its business,

03:13:06.531 --> 03:13:07.494
just to clarify,

03:13:08.651 --> 03:13:10.551
pulling relics, and selling relics

03:13:10.551 --> 03:13:12.949
from the ruins of Molaesmyr.

03:13:14.153 --> 03:13:16.951
There were many locations pre-Calamity all around

03:13:16.951 --> 03:13:20.411
Wildemount and the world beyond that are excavated from.

03:13:20.411 --> 03:13:21.901
LIAM: Yeah.

03:13:21.901 --> 03:13:24.967
MARISHA: Well, but I also learned in the Cobalt Soul--

03:13:24.967 --> 03:13:26.109
TRAVIS: She's going hypoxic.
LIAM: Breathe!

03:13:26.109 --> 03:13:27.484
MARISHA: Hang on.
TRAVIS: Big breath!

03:13:27.484 --> 03:13:30.331
LIAM: We are here for it, we are here for it, breathe!

03:13:30.331 --> 03:13:32.831
MARISHA: -- is that the Tomb Takers existed for roughly

03:13:32.831 --> 03:13:34.294
four to five years.

03:13:35.141 --> 03:13:39.721
And this whole ritual incident happened two years ago.

03:13:39.721 --> 03:13:44.431
Roughly. That puts us right at that seven-to-eight-year mark

03:13:44.431 --> 03:13:47.061
of when all of this excavation shit

03:13:47.061 --> 03:13:48.964
started fucking happening.

03:13:50.691 --> 03:13:52.541
And people started digging things up.

03:13:53.641 --> 03:13:54.791
SAM: Four to five years,

03:13:54.791 --> 03:13:57.341
four plus five is nine, but two years

03:13:57.341 --> 03:13:59.821
minus two is the seven members of our group.

03:13:59.821 --> 03:14:02.644
LAURA: Whoa!
MARISHA: We do have eyes. They're the nine.

03:14:02.644 --> 03:14:04.610
SAM: We are Aeor!

03:14:04.610 --> 03:14:05.818
(laughter)

03:14:05.818 --> 03:14:07.604
TRAVIS: (explosions)

03:14:07.604 --> 03:14:10.394
MATT: Aeor <i>was</i> the friends we made along the way.

03:14:10.394 --> 03:14:12.578
TRAVIS: (deep roaring)

03:14:12.578 --> 03:14:14.379
SAM: I like it.
ASHLEY: That's huge.

03:14:14.379 --> 03:14:15.351
SAM: It's a breakthrough.

03:14:15.351 --> 03:14:16.221
ASHLEY: That's a breakthrough.

03:14:16.221 --> 03:14:17.301
TALIESIN: So what happened next?

03:14:17.301 --> 03:14:19.226
SAM: We should go talk to a monk.
MARISHA: Well, I think

03:14:19.226 --> 03:14:20.921
Vess DeRogna--
LIAM: We try to confirm it.

03:14:20.921 --> 03:14:22.954
MARISHA: I think the people who know the most

03:14:22.954 --> 03:14:24.551
about all of this

03:14:24.551 --> 03:14:25.901
is Vess DeRogna.

03:14:25.901 --> 03:14:29.451
I think she has been throwing mercenaries at these

03:14:29.451 --> 03:14:33.364
excavation sites for years. Like a fucking meat mill.

03:14:33.364 --> 03:14:34.531
TRAVIS: And we're next.

03:14:34.531 --> 03:14:35.583
MARISHA: And we're next.

03:14:35.583 --> 03:14:37.581
TRAVIS: I'm so excited.

03:14:37.581 --> 03:14:39.772
LIAM: Rather than walk in and

03:14:39.772 --> 03:14:41.738
be the next group of adventures

03:14:41.738 --> 03:14:43.771
that she used to throw spaghetti at the wall--

03:14:43.771 --> 03:14:44.651
MARISHA: 100%. Yeah.

03:14:44.651 --> 03:14:46.869
LIAM: Why don't we go ask Mollymauk,

03:14:46.869 --> 03:14:51.354
or Nonagon, or Lucien or whoever the hell he is,

03:14:51.354 --> 03:14:54.021
what we're walking into before we walk into it.

03:14:54.021 --> 03:14:57.354
LAURA: Because what if when Molly was--

03:14:57.354 --> 03:15:00.628
what if when Lucien was doing the ritual

03:15:00.628 --> 03:15:03.578
and his soul was taken by the city,

03:15:03.578 --> 03:15:04.901
the soul is gone now,

03:15:04.901 --> 03:15:06.371
and then Molly took his place.

03:15:06.371 --> 03:15:08.221
So if we brought him back from the dead,

03:15:08.221 --> 03:15:09.641
we wouldn't be getting Lucien,

03:15:09.641 --> 03:15:11.541
we would be getting Molly, who didn't know anything.

03:15:11.541 --> 03:15:14.371
LIAM: Maybe it won't work, but maybe it will.

03:15:14.371 --> 03:15:16.521
MARISHA: We don't know which Molly we're going to get it.

03:15:16.521 --> 03:15:18.802
SAM: Let's go as him, and then we'll know real quick.

03:15:18.802 --> 03:15:20.010
TRAVIS: Admin!

03:15:20.010 --> 03:15:21.811
(laughter)

03:15:21.811 --> 03:15:23.731
ASHLEY: Do you think that Aeor is that city

03:15:23.731 --> 03:15:26.491
that we saw in the vision?

03:15:26.491 --> 03:15:27.681
MARISHA: I--
LIAM: It's possible.

03:15:27.681 --> 03:15:30.221
MARISHA: I don't know, but it feels--
LAURA: What if they did something?

03:15:30.221 --> 03:15:33.731
What if Aeor succeeded in creating it,

03:15:33.731 --> 03:15:37.481
and parts of Aeor split and became this

03:15:37.481 --> 03:15:39.971
demented being--
MARISHA: Right!

03:15:39.971 --> 03:15:41.401
LAURA: -- demented city--
MARISHA: Right!

03:15:41.401 --> 03:15:43.976
LAURA: -- and the city in this world

03:15:43.976 --> 03:15:46.200
crumbled and fell to ruin?

03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:50.031
MARISHA: Yeah, because we know that Aeor was a mageocracy

03:15:50.031 --> 03:15:52.071
so it had a bunch of fancypants

03:15:52.071 --> 03:15:54.201
mage people who could have totally maybe

03:15:54.201 --> 03:15:55.171
teleported it somewhere.

03:15:55.171 --> 03:15:57.261
Maybe it was a defense mechanism that went wrong.

03:15:57.261 --> 03:15:59.429
LIAM: There are entire cities in this world

03:15:59.429 --> 03:16:01.054
that are able to do that.

03:16:01.054 --> 03:16:04.004
MARISHA: Right! And then maybe they went to the Abyss

03:16:04.004 --> 03:16:06.501
and now it's this crazy, insane living city

03:16:06.501 --> 03:16:08.981
from being in the Abyss for thousands of years.

03:16:08.981 --> 03:16:10.681
TALIESIN: We have Cree. We have Lucien.

03:16:10.681 --> 03:16:12.711
Do we have any other members of the Tomb Takers

03:16:12.711 --> 03:16:15.541
that we can talk to?
MARISHA: So I remember, hang on.

03:16:15.541 --> 03:16:16.594
I remember...

03:16:17.749 --> 03:16:19.324
Cree--
SAM: On this post-it note.

03:16:19.324 --> 03:16:20.796
I've got a post-it over here.

03:16:20.796 --> 03:16:22.181
MARISHA: Talked about-- (laughs)

03:16:22.181 --> 03:16:25.731
ASHLEY: We could also up possibly talk to Gustav.

03:16:25.731 --> 03:16:27.561
MARISHA: So we could totally talk to Gustav,

03:16:27.561 --> 03:16:29.281
because he's from Shadycreek Run.

03:16:29.281 --> 03:16:32.558
This was Yasha's idea, just totally brilliant.

03:16:32.558 --> 03:16:34.794
ASHLEY: It's fine, it's not like
how you're doing, but thanks.

03:16:34.794 --> 03:16:36.034
MARISHA: No, no,

03:16:36.034 --> 03:16:37.771
I just have to give credit where credit's due,

03:16:37.771 --> 03:16:42.471
but the tabaxi, Cree, also rambled off

03:16:42.471 --> 03:16:45.921
Tyffial, and was like, "We should totally go

03:16:45.921 --> 03:16:47.789
"and talk to Tyffial."

03:16:47.789 --> 03:16:49.221
SAM: Is that a person?
MARISHA: Yes.

03:16:49.221 --> 03:16:51.441
ASHLEY: There's another name, I feel like.

03:16:51.441 --> 03:16:53.641
MARISHA: The only other one that I caught was Zora?

03:16:53.641 --> 03:16:56.176
ASHLEY: Jurrel, Zorel, Tyffial...

03:16:56.176 --> 03:16:57.501
MARISHA: Yes. Yes. That's them.

03:16:57.501 --> 03:16:59.621
That's them! That's the group of people

03:16:59.621 --> 03:17:01.943
that Cree mentioned and as like,

03:17:01.943 --> 03:17:04.679
"Oh, the Tomb Takers, we can get back together, man."

03:17:04.679 --> 03:17:06.393
ASHLEY: I didn't know what that
was, but I got it written down.

03:17:06.393 --> 03:17:07.226
MARISHA: Yeah, same!

03:17:07.226 --> 03:17:09.336
MATT: Zoran. Zoran is one.

03:17:09.336 --> 03:17:10.719
Otis was another,

03:17:10.719 --> 03:17:12.361
MARISHA: Zoran. Otis?

03:17:12.361 --> 03:17:13.943
MATT: Otis and Tyffial.

03:17:13.943 --> 03:17:15.371
MARISHA: And Tyffial! Okay.

03:17:15.371 --> 03:17:19.911
There was a Jurrel, but Jurrel was executed for--

03:17:19.911 --> 03:17:22.009
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why I was like--

03:17:22.009 --> 03:17:24.301
MATT: Run-in with the law.
ASHLEY: He's in a separate circle.

03:17:24.301 --> 03:17:25.134
MATT: Yeah.

03:17:25.134 --> 03:17:26.942
ASHLEY: I have, like--
LAURA: Wow!

03:17:26.942 --> 03:17:28.251
ASHLEY: Well, I just have things circled.

03:17:28.251 --> 03:17:32.201
LIAM: With absolute sincerity,

03:17:32.201 --> 03:17:33.641
we are impressed.

03:17:34.891 --> 03:17:37.551
With sincerity, but we are trying to find out

03:17:37.551 --> 03:17:40.431
about the Eyes of Nine, so let us go to the man

03:17:40.431 --> 03:17:42.961
with nine eyes on his body--
MARISHA: All right.

03:17:42.961 --> 03:17:44.768
LIAM: -- and ask him some questions.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:17:44.768 --> 03:17:46.861
TRAVIS: Can you wipe your-- right here, there's--

03:17:46.861 --> 03:17:47.703
MARISHA: Oh, am I drooling a little?

03:17:47.703 --> 03:17:48.871
TRAVIS: There's a bit of blood, yeah.

03:17:48.871 --> 03:17:49.704
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

03:17:52.331 --> 03:17:54.251
Sometimes the ki, it gets a little intense.

03:17:54.251 --> 03:17:57.024
LIAM: Careful, Tetsuo, don't push too hard.

03:17:57.024 --> 03:17:59.531
SAM: This will help us frame our questions

03:17:59.531 --> 03:18:00.921
and know what to ask.

03:18:00.921 --> 03:18:02.421
For sure.
MARISHA: Hopefully.

03:18:02.421 --> 03:18:04.411
By the way, all theories,

03:18:04.411 --> 03:18:08.451
I don't know if Aeor has been bamfed to the Astral Sea.

03:18:08.451 --> 03:18:10.914
SAM: We understand that these are not proven things.

03:18:10.914 --> 03:18:11.841
MARISHA: None of this is proven.

03:18:11.841 --> 03:18:14.594
It's just all that I have written down.

03:18:14.594 --> 03:18:17.321
LAURA: We could also go to Shadycreek Run

03:18:17.321 --> 03:18:19.841
and ask around for the Tomb Takers.

03:18:19.841 --> 03:18:21.691
Maybe throw around some of those names

03:18:21.691 --> 03:18:24.932
like we know them, and see where it leads?

03:18:24.932 --> 03:18:27.281
TALIESIN: That seems like a good idea.

03:18:27.281 --> 03:18:28.531
SAM: Let's go talk to Molly.

03:18:29.521 --> 03:18:30.861
TALIESIN: Haven't done this in a while.

03:18:30.861 --> 03:18:33.983
MARISHA: I have next to Tyffial: "Nogvurot."

03:18:33.983 --> 03:18:36.136
So I think-- Ty-fyell?

03:18:36.136 --> 03:18:38.161
Tyffiell--
MATT: Tyffial.

03:18:38.161 --> 03:18:39.611
MARISHA: -- was last in Nogvurot,

03:18:39.611 --> 03:18:42.721
but that was also when I wrote this down months ago,

03:18:42.721 --> 03:18:44.101
and he could have totally moved on.

03:18:44.101 --> 03:18:45.701
LIAM: You have a piece of that coat?

03:18:48.701 --> 03:18:50.131
Gather 'round.

03:18:50.131 --> 03:18:51.909
SAM: Let me just go and get my son and husband.

03:18:51.909 --> 03:18:52.751
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

03:18:52.751 --> 03:18:53.917
(laughter)

03:18:53.917 --> 03:18:54.833
LIAM: We're leaving!

03:18:54.833 --> 03:18:58.241
(laughter)

03:18:58.241 --> 03:19:01.801
TRAVIS: Get them quickly before Beau
suffers from the adrenaline dump.

03:19:01.801 --> 03:19:04.521
SAM: I guess we're doing this in the bar?

03:19:04.521 --> 03:19:05.354
LIAM: No, no.

03:19:05.354 --> 03:19:07.449
We're going to go find a more private place.
SAM: Oh, then let's go! Okay, good.

03:19:07.449 --> 03:19:10.461
LIAM: We could also leave your family at a tavern,

03:19:10.461 --> 03:19:13.001
or an inn or a park.
SAM: Sure.

03:19:13.001 --> 03:19:15.992
I'll tell them to go to the-- what is it?

03:19:15.992 --> 03:19:18.771
What's the nice one? Not Song and Supper.

03:19:18.771 --> 03:19:23.033
Lodge of the Eclipse? No. Evening Nip is not a good place.

03:19:23.033 --> 03:19:25.649
Oh! The Tri-Spires. They can go to the Tri-Spires.

03:19:25.649 --> 03:19:26.902
LAURA: If they're allowed in.

03:19:28.067 --> 03:19:30.131
SAM: Well, they're nice.

03:19:30.131 --> 03:19:31.781
TRAVIS: You got to be rich.

03:19:31.781 --> 03:19:33.945
SAM: They're rich.

03:19:33.945 --> 03:19:35.981
MATT: The Lodge of the Eclipse is the large tavern

03:19:35.981 --> 03:19:38.501
in the Pentamarket. It's not amazing,

03:19:38.501 --> 03:19:39.551
but it's not bad either.

03:19:39.551 --> 03:19:43.309
It's more of a busier place.
SAM: Lodge of the Eclipse?

03:19:43.309 --> 03:19:45.313
That was a night pub and theater.

03:19:45.313 --> 03:19:46.341
MATT: It was indeed.

03:19:46.341 --> 03:19:48.651
SAM: All right.
ASHLEY: They could go watch a show!

03:19:48.651 --> 03:19:49.961
SAM: I'll tell him to go and

03:19:49.961 --> 03:19:52.261
watch the dinner theater production of Oliver!.

03:19:53.478 --> 03:19:54.986
TRAVIS: Oliver!

03:19:54.986 --> 03:19:56.019
TALIESIN: Sure.
MATT: Perfect.

03:19:56.019 --> 03:19:57.169
LAURA: They're going to be like, "Great!

03:19:57.169 --> 03:19:58.859
"So glad you brought us here!"

03:19:58.859 --> 03:19:59.942
(laughter)

03:19:59.942 --> 03:20:01.425
LAURA: "This has been fun!"

03:20:03.108 --> 03:20:04.681
MATT: Are you leaving them here at the inn

03:20:04.681 --> 03:20:06.001
to stay for the night?

03:20:06.001 --> 03:20:06.834
SAM: I guess so.

03:20:06.834 --> 03:20:08.731
LIAM: Well, I would have to take us back

03:20:08.731 --> 03:20:11.911
into the Cobalt Soul to return,

03:20:11.911 --> 03:20:13.441
which we could do.

03:20:13.441 --> 03:20:14.274
SAM: Just have them wait here.

03:20:14.274 --> 03:20:15.861
We can always catch up with them later tonight.

03:20:15.861 --> 03:20:18.041
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. We can get a room, and then that way

03:20:18.041 --> 03:20:20.081
we can bamf out in privacy.

03:20:20.081 --> 03:20:21.681
SAM: I'll leave them a hundred gold.

03:20:23.631 --> 03:20:25.631
MATT: "All right. Well, I will make sure that--"

03:20:25.631 --> 03:20:27.351
SAM: A couple hours, a few hours, we'll be back real quick.

03:20:27.351 --> 03:20:29.294
Just going to go talk to a dead person.

03:20:30.251 --> 03:20:31.935
MATT: "Right. Okay. "
SAM: He's a dead friend.

03:20:31.935 --> 03:20:35.171
MATT: "Our lives have gotten very
interesting in the recent year.

03:20:35.171 --> 03:20:37.001
"I'll take care of Luc. Maybe I'll make--

03:20:37.001 --> 03:20:39.313
"I'll take him to see a show."
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:20:39.313 --> 03:20:41.517
MATT: "You ready for that, Luc? "
(whining, as Luc) "No."

03:20:41.517 --> 03:20:43.214
"Trust me. It'll be fun."

03:20:43.214 --> 03:20:46.738
LAURA: Before we leave, I'm just going to pull Caleb aside.

03:20:46.738 --> 03:20:48.251
LIAM: Avenue Z?

03:20:48.251 --> 03:20:49.851
LAURA: Caleb?
LIAM: Yeah?

03:20:49.851 --> 03:20:54.071
LAURA: I think-- I think one of the reasons

03:20:54.071 --> 03:20:56.395
that some of us are a little hesitant

03:20:56.395 --> 03:20:59.286
to go talk to Molly is, you know,

03:20:59.286 --> 03:21:02.814
because it is a little painful to do that.

03:21:03.911 --> 03:21:05.545
So,

03:21:05.545 --> 03:21:08.751
that's maybe why Beau is...

03:21:08.751 --> 03:21:10.400
is holding back on that.

03:21:10.400 --> 03:21:11.441
I think.

03:21:13.025 --> 03:21:14.465
Just so you know.

03:21:14.465 --> 03:21:15.393
LIAM: I gather.

03:21:15.393 --> 03:21:16.226
LAURA: Okay.

03:21:17.844 --> 03:21:19.761
But it's important.

03:21:19.761 --> 03:21:21.187
LIAM: I think so.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:21:22.045 --> 03:21:22.878
LIAM: Okay.

03:21:26.273 --> 03:21:29.251
MATT: So Yeza and Luc have set themselves up in the room

03:21:29.251 --> 03:21:30.301
and they're going to watch some

03:21:30.301 --> 03:21:32.461
of the local theatrical productions that might run

03:21:32.461 --> 03:21:33.701
in the next few hours or so.

03:21:33.701 --> 03:21:35.675
And they seem to be taken care of.

03:21:35.675 --> 03:21:37.308
What would you like to do?

03:21:41.481 --> 03:21:44.121
SAM: We're going, right?
MARISHA: I'm ready whenever you are.

03:21:44.121 --> 03:21:45.641
LIAM: Okay.

03:21:45.641 --> 03:21:47.801
MARISHA: You said it was raining there?

03:21:47.801 --> 03:21:48.914
MATT: It was, quite a bit.

03:21:50.164 --> 03:21:51.514
MARISHA: Put your hoods up.

03:21:53.491 --> 03:21:56.171
TRAVIS: Don't have a hood. Do you mean, like, figuratively?

03:21:56.171 --> 03:21:57.481
I'll just make myself look like somebody else.

03:21:57.481 --> 03:21:59.409
MARISHA: You can control water, you're fine.

03:21:59.409 --> 03:22:02.048
LIAM: You like the water.
SAM: I'll just start fanning you.

03:22:02.048 --> 03:22:04.501
(laughter)

03:22:04.501 --> 03:22:07.451
LIAM: Okay, I wrapped that bit of fabric around my hand

03:22:07.451 --> 03:22:10.721
and mutter the words and away we go.

03:22:10.721 --> 03:22:11.554
MATT: All right.

03:22:13.451 --> 03:22:16.191
You all take a breath, and the spell catches you

03:22:16.191 --> 03:22:17.511
before you can take the full breath.

03:22:17.511 --> 03:22:20.261
And so the wind that you're taking in,

03:22:20.261 --> 03:22:24.841
it goes from warm to immediately cold, mid-inhale.

03:22:24.841 --> 03:22:27.124
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm looking forward to a coat.

03:22:27.124 --> 03:22:29.931
MATT: As you all arrive-- (splashing)

03:22:29.931 --> 03:22:32.981
your feet hit the muddy ground around you.

03:22:32.981 --> 03:22:34.739
The gray sky above, you hear--

03:22:34.739 --> 03:22:36.447
(thunder crashing)

03:22:36.447 --> 03:22:39.001
the rumble of thunder off in the distance.

03:22:39.001 --> 03:22:42.631
It invigorates you for a moment and that

03:22:42.631 --> 03:22:44.031
energy hits you.

03:22:44.031 --> 03:22:48.301
And then also fades as quick as you really take in the space

03:22:48.301 --> 03:22:49.451
that you've arrived at.

03:22:50.491 --> 03:22:53.414
You can see the Crispvale Thicket on the horizon.

03:22:55.121 --> 03:22:56.831
Far off that direction, and ahead,

03:22:56.831 --> 03:22:59.711
you can see a few rolling hills,

03:22:59.711 --> 03:23:01.911
and you stand on the road that continues up.

03:23:02.771 --> 03:23:04.644
And much like Jester described it,

03:23:05.794 --> 03:23:07.645
a little ways off the road,

03:23:07.645 --> 03:23:09.141
to the northeast of where you're standing,

03:23:09.141 --> 03:23:14.141
you can see the off-kilter stick,

03:23:14.141 --> 03:23:15.041
where it was left.

03:23:18.871 --> 03:23:21.369
MARISHA: I just reach out and grab Yasha's hand.

03:23:22.317 --> 03:23:23.858
ASHLEY: I squeeze it back.

03:23:27.091 --> 03:23:30.984
TALIESIN: Just as a side note,
I'm going to say that generally,

03:23:32.251 --> 03:23:35.524
we don't recommend doing this in my profession.

03:23:37.311 --> 03:23:38.144
So,

03:23:41.221 --> 03:23:42.571
just letting everyone know.

03:23:45.051 --> 03:23:46.242
SAM: Thank you.

03:23:47.721 --> 03:23:50.245
We'll take the utmost care.

03:23:50.245 --> 03:23:53.641
And who knows, he might not be there anymore.

03:23:53.641 --> 03:23:55.032
TALIESIN: Who knows?

03:23:56.231 --> 03:23:58.471
SAM: Do you want me to just run over and see if it's--

03:23:58.471 --> 03:24:00.464
LAURA: Yeah. I'll walk over with you.

03:24:01.725 --> 03:24:03.345
TRAVIS: I think we all will.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:24:03.345 --> 03:24:04.676
TALIESIN: Let's not split up.

03:24:06.651 --> 03:24:07.692
MATT: Okay.

03:24:09.011 --> 03:24:10.971
Who's helming this?

03:24:10.971 --> 03:24:12.632
SAM: Helming...

03:24:12.632 --> 03:24:14.471
the digging?

03:24:14.471 --> 03:24:16.654
LIAM: We have two options...

03:24:17.561 --> 03:24:18.954
here as well.

03:24:20.875 --> 03:24:23.762
It could be a conversation or a reunion.

03:24:27.261 --> 03:24:31.401
TALIESIN: I'd say I've got a conversation in me,

03:24:31.401 --> 03:24:34.309
I don't-- reunion is a lot.

03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:35.142
LIAM: Okay.

03:24:37.011 --> 03:24:41.161
TALIESIN: And again, let's know what we're dealing with.

03:24:41.161 --> 03:24:45.069
LIAM: Well, conversation is a good first step

03:24:45.069 --> 03:24:46.835
and maybe a final step.

03:24:46.835 --> 03:24:49.464
LAURA: And remember, if he is here,

03:24:50.455 --> 03:24:51.538
Caduceus,

03:24:53.431 --> 03:24:55.584
didn't you set things in motion?

03:24:57.301 --> 03:24:58.773
Will his body still be...

03:25:00.961 --> 03:25:02.184
recognizable?

03:25:03.311 --> 03:25:04.624
TALIESIN: No matter what I did...

03:25:06.221 --> 03:25:08.529
you're not going to see anything that...

03:25:10.711 --> 03:25:13.547
No matter what I did, it doesn't really matter.

03:25:13.547 --> 03:25:14.380
LAURA: Okay.

03:25:20.581 --> 03:25:23.851
SAM: Are we investigating first or just digging?

03:25:23.851 --> 03:25:25.126
MATT: You can make an investigation, if you'd like.

03:25:25.126 --> 03:25:26.501
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Baby steps.

03:25:26.501 --> 03:25:28.026
SAM: I'll check it out.

03:25:28.026 --> 03:25:29.261
MATT: Go for it.

03:25:29.261 --> 03:25:31.144
LIAM: I'll go up with you and watch.

03:25:31.144 --> 03:25:33.802
LAURA: Ooh, while that's going on

03:25:33.802 --> 03:25:35.791
I'm going to cast Commune.

03:25:35.791 --> 03:25:37.141
I'm going to spend 10 minutes.

03:25:38.409 --> 03:25:39.721
MATT: Okay, while they're doing this?

03:25:39.721 --> 03:25:42.360
Okay. So it'll take you 10 minutes to do that.

03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:44.241
SAM: I'm going to very gently,

03:25:44.241 --> 03:25:47.381
not probing with any sort of sharp objects or anything,

03:25:47.381 --> 03:25:51.193
but mostly hands just dig down. And I rolled a 28.

03:25:51.193 --> 03:25:53.349
MATT: 28. Okay.

03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:55.021
(clears throat)

03:25:55.021 --> 03:25:58.321
So. Much of this area, which is mainly just like, you know,

03:25:58.321 --> 03:26:01.446
So. Much of this area, which is mainly just like, you know,

03:26:01.446 --> 03:26:04.591
grass and dirt with elements of rock and these hills and

03:26:04.591 --> 03:26:08.281
these fields here, the rain definitely slicks over

03:26:08.281 --> 03:26:11.389
most any signs of the grave you guys had made,

03:26:11.389 --> 03:26:15.964
aside from the marker stick and
the coat that once held to it.

03:26:16.941 --> 03:26:20.699
After two minutes of sifting through,

03:26:21.949 --> 03:26:25.011
the ground layers become a little bit looser

03:26:25.011 --> 03:26:26.694
than you were expecting to find.

03:26:30.181 --> 03:26:32.511
SAM: I'll keep going down.

03:26:32.511 --> 03:26:34.121
MATT: You keep digging and pulling aside,

03:26:34.121 --> 03:26:37.199
and the rain and mud is starting to pour in a bit.

03:26:37.199 --> 03:26:40.431
And it's a bit of a tough fight going against the weather,

03:26:40.431 --> 03:26:43.194
but you get about two,

03:26:44.261 --> 03:26:46.291
two and a half feet down,

03:26:46.291 --> 03:26:48.521
and there's still not much of a sign.

03:26:48.521 --> 03:26:51.097
LIAM: I drop down too, say: I'm going to hell anyway.

03:26:51.097 --> 03:26:54.681
And then start to pull at the mud with you.

03:26:54.681 --> 03:26:58.971
MATT: Fervently, you both begin
to pull, and pull, and pull away.

03:26:58.971 --> 03:27:03.081
Dirt and mud is now slapping up onto the sides as this,

03:27:03.081 --> 03:27:07.054
what was once just straight land turns into a pit

03:27:10.811 --> 03:27:13.781
and still no sign of Mollymauk Tealeaf.

03:27:13.781 --> 03:27:15.964
SAM: Jester, can you locate object?

03:27:18.001 --> 03:27:20.761
Maybe, maybe we dug down in the wrong spot.

03:27:20.761 --> 03:27:22.841
LAURA: I mean, I can scry on hi--

03:27:22.841 --> 03:27:25.321
SAM: Isn't there like a locate object spell or something?

03:27:25.321 --> 03:27:27.101
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't, I don't--

03:27:27.101 --> 03:27:29.770
SAM: For his skull.
TRAVIS: Or his swords or, yeah anything.

03:27:29.770 --> 03:27:31.771
ASHLEY: Will his blood do anything?
MARISHA: Yeah, we have his blood.

03:27:31.771 --> 03:27:32.962
LAURA: Yeah.

03:27:34.761 --> 03:27:37.971
LAURA: I don't have Locate Object
prepared, I can't do it now,

03:27:37.971 --> 03:27:42.331
but I could try to scry on him with a higher level,

03:27:42.331 --> 03:27:45.441
see if I could find--
SAM: I'm going to, just in case,

03:27:45.441 --> 03:27:47.734
investigate around to see if there's any...

03:27:49.341 --> 03:27:53.941
I mean, the mud is not recently covered, right?

03:27:53.941 --> 03:27:56.701
I'm just going to look around to see if there's any,

03:27:56.701 --> 03:27:59.841
I don't know, shovel heads or-- or just any--

03:27:59.841 --> 03:28:01.732
any sign of any one who--

03:28:01.732 --> 03:28:03.210
TRAVIS: Digging tools.
MARISHA: Digging him up?

03:28:03.210 --> 03:28:04.710
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:28:05.861 --> 03:28:08.611
LIAM: If I help, will she get it at advantage?

03:28:08.611 --> 03:28:09.836
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Okay.

03:28:11.333 --> 03:28:12.166
SAM: Terrible.

03:28:12.166 --> 03:28:13.431
LAURA: Are you still communing?

03:28:13.431 --> 03:28:15.161
LAURA: I'm going to cancel that, and I'm going to go

03:28:15.161 --> 03:28:17.421
straight to scrying instead.

03:28:17.421 --> 03:28:18.254
MATT: Okay.

03:28:18.254 --> 03:28:19.502
SAM: 23.

03:28:19.502 --> 03:28:20.561
MATT: 23.

03:28:21.721 --> 03:28:25.171
It's tough to look for anything like that in this vicinity.

03:28:26.471 --> 03:28:28.061
It is...

03:28:28.061 --> 03:28:29.821
very muddy.

03:28:29.821 --> 03:28:31.991
You do find a...

03:28:32.891 --> 03:28:34.691
dirt-stained coat.

03:28:36.021 --> 03:28:37.411
SAM: Is it his coat?

03:28:37.411 --> 03:28:39.016
MATT: You find Mollymauk's coat.
MARISHA: No way.

03:28:39.016 --> 03:28:40.424
SAM: Where was it? Was it like--

03:28:40.424 --> 03:28:42.281
MATT: It was about 20 or so feet off.

03:28:42.281 --> 03:28:46.251
It may have been blown off of the grave site by the wind

03:28:46.251 --> 03:28:48.221
and then just left to the elements.

03:28:48.221 --> 03:28:50.369
TRAVIS: You fucking take that shit.
MARISHA: Yeah, you grab

03:28:50.369 --> 03:28:52.911
that fucking coat.
SAM: Of course! Of course!

03:28:52.911 --> 03:28:57.541
MATT: But you don't find any
implements or tools or anything.

03:28:57.541 --> 03:29:00.531
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- I notice
they're having difficulty with the--

03:29:00.531 --> 03:29:02.651
with the digging. I'm going to go in and also try.

03:29:02.651 --> 03:29:04.609
And I've done this before.

03:29:04.609 --> 03:29:08.418
Was I there when you buried him? I'm trying to remember.

03:29:08.418 --> 03:29:11.203
LAURA: You weren't. You were there
when we revisited the grave.

03:29:11.203 --> 03:29:13.754
MATT: Yeah. You've been here for the grave,
but not for the actual burial.

03:29:13.754 --> 03:29:16.244
TALIESIN: So they're in the right place.

03:29:17.271 --> 03:29:18.961
MATT: I mean, as far as the marker was set,

03:29:18.961 --> 03:29:22.071
like, they went to where you remember them focusing on.

03:29:22.071 --> 03:29:24.271
TALIESIN: This it looks right.
MATT: They might be off.

03:29:25.881 --> 03:29:28.321
TALIESIN: I'm going to just-- I know what this looks like.

03:29:28.321 --> 03:29:30.951
I'm going to try and help. I've got a shovel, too.

03:29:30.951 --> 03:29:32.491
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

03:29:32.491 --> 03:29:34.406
TALIESIN: Never perception. Okay.

03:29:34.406 --> 03:29:36.671
(laughter)

03:29:36.671 --> 03:29:38.951
MATT: I mean, you can look at the ground, and it's muddy.

03:29:38.951 --> 03:29:42.643
This is more of a feeling through
the dirt and looking for signs of--

03:29:42.643 --> 03:29:44.131
TALIESIN: Investigation roll. I got a seven.

03:29:44.131 --> 03:29:44.981
MATT: Seven.

03:29:44.981 --> 03:29:47.031
It's just hard, and the rain is making it very difficult

03:29:47.031 --> 03:29:50.471
to make any sort of finite details of the surrounding earth.

03:29:50.471 --> 03:29:53.028
TALIESIN: Can we get some cover?

03:29:53.028 --> 03:29:54.091
I don't know how.

03:29:54.091 --> 03:29:56.061
LIAM: I could throw up the dome.

03:29:57.531 --> 03:30:00.419
Or are you thinking of something else?

03:30:00.419 --> 03:30:01.810
TALIESIN: This is just filling with water.

03:30:01.810 --> 03:30:02.941
LIAM: Yeah.

03:30:02.941 --> 03:30:05.681
TRAVIS: I can use Control Water and empty the--

03:30:05.681 --> 03:30:08.311
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: You can throw it out of the dome.

03:30:08.311 --> 03:30:11.219
TALIESIN: See if we can find cloth.

03:30:11.219 --> 03:30:12.451
LIAM: I'll start working on it,

03:30:12.451 --> 03:30:15.868
focused on where the stick was in the ground.

03:30:15.868 --> 03:30:16.961
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to scry.

03:30:16.961 --> 03:30:19.429
MATT: Okay, and that takes one minute?

03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:20.845
LAURA: It's not a--

03:30:22.137 --> 03:30:24.831
MATT: Casting time on that is--?

03:30:24.831 --> 03:30:27.071
LAURA: 10 minutes again, so it's...

03:30:27.071 --> 03:30:28.111
MATT: So, so yeah.

03:30:28.111 --> 03:30:29.731
So you'd begun that a while back,

03:30:29.731 --> 03:30:32.351
they've been searching and searching.

03:30:32.351 --> 03:30:33.184
Okay.

03:30:33.184 --> 03:30:37.535
LAURA: I'm going to say: Artie, I need your help again.

03:30:37.535 --> 03:30:41.421
MATT: In the cold, soaked through,

03:30:41.421 --> 03:30:43.971
you sit there, hearing the heavy rain

03:30:43.971 --> 03:30:45.261
splashing around you in the mud.

03:30:45.261 --> 03:30:48.295
And as you concentrate and put out your prayer to the

03:30:48.295 --> 03:30:51.461
Traveler, you can feel the...

03:30:51.461 --> 03:30:53.961
the rain began to subside.

03:30:54.986 --> 03:30:56.577
Anyone's keeping a keen eye,

03:30:56.577 --> 03:30:57.961
which would probably be you just on the side,

03:30:57.961 --> 03:30:59.881
you can see that Jester, for a brief moment,

03:30:59.881 --> 03:31:04.218
there's a shimmering, invisible
cloak around her for a moment.

03:31:04.218 --> 03:31:06.803
The rain seems to be splashing about an inch off of her.

03:31:09.061 --> 03:31:10.271
As you close your eyes,

03:31:10.271 --> 03:31:12.761
you feel your consciousness pulled out of you and a voice

03:31:12.761 --> 03:31:13.894
goes in your ear,

03:31:14.838 --> 03:31:16.115
(as the Traveler) "Intriguing."

03:31:17.191 --> 03:31:19.801
You see clouds and weather,

03:31:19.801 --> 03:31:21.661
darkened storms,

03:31:21.661 --> 03:31:23.111
and as you're pulled through,

03:31:24.001 --> 03:31:25.954
the heavy, thick,

03:31:26.921 --> 03:31:27.970
blizzarding snow--

03:31:27.970 --> 03:31:29.702
LAURA: I knew it!
LIAM: Knew it.

03:31:29.702 --> 03:31:31.504
LAURA: I fucking knew it!
MARISHA: They're together.

03:31:31.504 --> 03:31:35.901
MATT: You see trudging through a familiar blizzard,

03:31:35.901 --> 03:31:38.218
a purple-skinned tiefling--

03:31:38.218 --> 03:31:39.321
SAM and ASHLEY: (gasp)

03:31:39.321 --> 03:31:41.466
MATT: -- in heavy coat and hood,

03:31:41.466 --> 03:31:42.799
LIAM: Fucking wicked!

03:31:42.799 --> 03:31:44.557
MATT: -- walking

03:31:44.557 --> 03:31:46.781
with a grin, and an intensity

03:31:48.041 --> 03:31:50.177
of confidence and purpose.

03:31:50.177 --> 03:31:51.010
SAM: Oh!

03:31:51.010 --> 03:31:52.809
TRAVIS: I have goosebumps!
MARISHA: No! No, no, don't do it--

03:31:52.809 --> 03:31:54.627
MATT: And that's where we're going to end tonight's episode.

03:31:54.627 --> 03:31:55.659
(shouting)

03:31:55.659 --> 03:31:58.382
TRAVIS: You can't!
MATT: Yes, I can!

03:31:58.382 --> 03:31:59.670
I can, and I did.

03:31:59.670 --> 03:32:02.462
(yelling and protesting)
LIAM: That was the ending!

03:32:02.462 --> 03:32:05.193
TRAVIS: You are kidding me!

03:32:05.193 --> 03:32:07.010
LIAM: Perfect! (laughs)

03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:08.785
SAM: (tortured yell)
MATT: So!

03:32:08.785 --> 03:32:10.525
We'll pick up on there next week.

03:32:10.525 --> 03:32:12.658
LIAM: Yeah!
ASHLEY: I want to do it now!

03:32:12.658 --> 03:32:13.911
(laughter)

03:32:13.911 --> 03:32:15.961
LIAM: So fucking metal. I love it.
LAURA: Did you know he was going to be there?

03:32:15.961 --> 03:32:17.092
Did you already know?

03:32:18.451 --> 03:32:19.921
TALIESIN: No, I'm not going to talk--

03:32:19.921 --> 03:32:20.900
I'm not saying shit.
TRAVIS: No!

03:32:20.900 --> 03:32:23.988
TALIESIN: I'm not saying shit.
SAM: Oh, so wait--

03:32:23.988 --> 03:32:24.996
TRAVIS: No!

03:32:24.996 --> 03:32:28.469
SAM: Wait, does scrying-- scrying-- we just scryed.

03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:30.935
LAURA: I just scryed!
SAM: You have to know the creature.

03:32:30.935 --> 03:32:31.931
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:32:31.931 --> 03:32:35.153
SAM: So that means... the <i>body</i> of the creature?

03:32:35.153 --> 03:32:36.494
LAURA: The body of the creature--

03:32:36.494 --> 03:32:39.281
MATT: The body of the creature, and the blood as a focus.

03:32:39.281 --> 03:32:41.941
SAM: But we don't know if that's "Mollymauk."

03:32:41.941 --> 03:32:43.469
MATT: You have no idea.
LIAM: No idea!

03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:45.512
SAM: That body--
MARISHA: He's going to have another name--

03:32:45.512 --> 03:32:47.154
ASHLEY: There's no way.
MARISHA: Absolutely.

03:32:47.154 --> 03:32:48.003
MATT: You have no idea.

03:32:48.003 --> 03:32:49.986
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
ASHLEY: He died again.

03:32:49.986 --> 03:32:52.201
MARISHA: He died again and he came back something else.

03:32:52.201 --> 03:32:53.961
TALIESIN: Or, you know--
ASHLEY: Maybe he's got nine lives.

03:32:53.961 --> 03:32:56.931
TALIESIN: Risen as undead, restored, could have been

03:32:56.931 --> 03:32:58.571
a dozen different things.

03:32:58.571 --> 03:33:00.811
ASHLEY: He's not going to know us.
MARISHA: Mm-mm.

03:33:00.811 --> 03:33:02.771
SAM: Or maybe he knows everything.
TRAVIS: Fuck me!

03:33:02.771 --> 03:33:06.711
LAURA: I wonder if all of the
rest of them, Tyffial, Zoran, Otis,

03:33:06.711 --> 03:33:09.101
they're all fucking there, too.
ASHLEY: They got to be.

03:33:09.101 --> 03:33:10.601
MARISHA: Because if they were part of some sort of

03:33:10.601 --> 03:33:12.791
fucking order and some sort of cult in their--

03:33:12.791 --> 03:33:14.662
LAURA: They all gathered back up!

03:33:14.662 --> 03:33:16.636
TRAVIS: You gotta be shitting me, man!
MARISHA: Because Cree was like,

03:33:16.636 --> 03:33:19.209
"I can get the gang back together right now!"

03:33:19.209 --> 03:33:21.851
ASHLEY: Yep.
MARISHA: So what if Cree did?

03:33:21.851 --> 03:33:23.081
LIAM: I just want to throw out, too,

03:33:23.081 --> 03:33:26.571
like, how fucking crazy is it that

03:33:26.571 --> 03:33:29.851
so long ago, before any of this stuff was fleshed out.

03:33:29.851 --> 03:33:32.861
We called this group the fucking Mighty Nein.

03:33:32.861 --> 03:33:35.650
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, that's pretty fucked.

03:33:35.650 --> 03:33:37.025
LIAM: Aliens!

03:33:37.025 --> 03:33:41.031
(laughter)

03:33:41.031 --> 03:33:43.473
TALIESIN: Nine eye tattoos was pretty fucking random, too.

03:33:43.473 --> 03:33:46.834
I mean, like, I don't know how the fuck that happened.

03:33:46.834 --> 03:33:49.404
TRAVIS: Oh, that's how the fuck that happened.

03:33:49.404 --> 03:33:52.733
TALIESIN: But like just the interconnectedness of things.

03:33:52.733 --> 03:33:54.657
TRAVIS: Right! You designed that before we started.

03:33:54.657 --> 03:33:55.915
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. That was all--

03:33:55.915 --> 03:33:57.781
that was all before any of this shit started.

03:33:57.781 --> 03:33:59.357
MATT: Shit gets weird.

03:34:00.251 --> 03:34:04.600
LIAM: Cats, nine lives, Mighty Nein, Eyes of Nine.

03:34:04.600 --> 03:34:06.351
MATT: It's crazy.
TRAVIS: We got to wait a week.

03:34:06.351 --> 03:34:07.851
MATT: It's really wild.

03:34:07.851 --> 03:34:11.151
All righty. Well, we'll pick this up next week.

03:34:11.151 --> 03:34:14.280
Enjoy your weekend. We love
you guys very much. And...

03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:16.121
Is it Thursday yet? Good night.

03:34:16.121 --> 03:34:17.060
TRAVIS: Oh my go--

03:34:17.996 --> 03:34:20.747
MATT: Ok!  So, sorry about
the cliffhanger there folks!

03:34:20.747 --> 03:34:25.749
So just a reminder, we will not be
having an episode next week, October 1st

03:34:25.749 --> 03:34:28.005
due to things we have to take care of
(Omar barks)

03:34:28.005 --> 03:34:30.258
MATT: Omar agrees.

03:34:30.258 --> 03:34:34.008
Everyone is happy and fine but we
will not have an episode next week.

03:34:34.008 --> 03:34:38.513

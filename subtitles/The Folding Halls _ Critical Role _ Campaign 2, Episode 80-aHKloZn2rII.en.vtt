00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.284
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome

2
00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:03.162
to tonight's episode of Critical Role

3
00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:04.507
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:05.878
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:08.214
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:09.896
MATT: Before we get into tonight's-- wow.

7
00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:11.612
Before we get into tonight's episode,

8
00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:12.893
we have some quick announcements to get through,

9
00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:15.136
beginning with our sponsors for this evening,

10
00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:16.148
Sam, if you would do the honors

11
00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.061
of our first sponsor tonight.

12
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:21.098
SAM: Our sponsor today is Skybound Games,

13
00:00:21.098 --> 00:00:23.433
and their release of enhanced versions

14
00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.167
of classic D&amp;D video games

15
00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:27.746
to consoles this fall and winter.

16
00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:30.151
I thought it would be fun to get a temporary tattoo

17
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.005
of the word "Skybound" across my face.

18
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:37.235
But I did not realize I'm extremely allergic to henna.

19
00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.736
So my face is a little bit swollen right now.

20
00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:44.986
Despite my advertising injury, the show must go on.

21
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.018
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

22
00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:49.631
Help him, help him.

23
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:53.220
SAM: Skybound is releasing classic D&amp;D video games

24
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.660
like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment,

25
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.913
Icewind Dale,

26
00:00:59.913 --> 00:01:01.239
and Neverwinter Nights,

27
00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.219
all coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One

28
00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.736
for the first time-- oh, yeah.

29
00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:09.313
So I got a prednisone shot

30
00:01:09.313 --> 00:01:11.205
to take down some of the swelling,

31
00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.291
but it turns out I'm also allergic to prednisone.

32
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:17.438
My hands are twice their normal size,

33
00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:20.679
which means I can give an even bigger thumbs up

34
00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.853
to Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale

35
00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:26.805
which will be launching on October 15th.

36
00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:29.051
Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,

37
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:32.309
which includes Baldur's Gate One and Two

38
00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:37.309
and Siege of Dragonspear also launches on October 15th.

39
00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.184
TRAVIS: Is the bandage in his eye?

40
00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:42.359
SAM: And Neverwinter Nights launches on December 3rd.

41
00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:46.375
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Nope.

42
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.480
SAM: When they told me, I pumped my fist with excitement,

43
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.063
and I broke my arm.

44
00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:57.991
I'm in a lot of pain, but you know what won't feel bad?

45
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.374
Buying these enhanced editions!

46
00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:03.428

(laughter)

51
00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:15.086
I think I need to go to the hospital.

52
00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:17.137
(laughter)
Back to you, Matt!

53
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.876
MATT: Thank you, Sam. (laughs)

54
00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:24.006
Legitimately actually really excited for these releases.

55
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.129
What are you--
LAURA: Can you breathe, Sam?

56
00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.082
LIAM: I will always see this when

57
00:02:28.082 --> 00:02:29.440
I play Baldur's Gate now.

58
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.318
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

59
00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.662
Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Skybound.

60
00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:37.529

so I'm excited for you guys to check it out.

96
00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:00.548
TALIESIN: Such facial hair.

97
00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:01.968
LAURA: <i>Such</i> facial hair.
TRAVIS: Much wow.

98
00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:04.115
LIAM: Too sexy. That

99
00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:05.197
trailer was too sexy.
MATT: I was going to shave my beard

100
00:04:05.197 --> 00:04:08.563
much earlier, but then I said, yeah.
LAURA: I did like that priest look, baby.

101
00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:09.808
MATT: Oh yeah, you looked good.

102
00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:11.336
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah, I'll forgive your sins.

103
00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:14.080
(laughter)

104
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.679
MATT: Yeah, it was worth holding on to the facial hair

105
00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:17.814
for a little longer.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was good!

106
00:04:17.814 --> 00:04:19.514
MATT: And today, if you haven't seen it yet,

107
00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:21.161
we shared a special, unannounced reward

108
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.190
for our recent Kickstarter--

109
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.223
meaning unofficially announced as part of the Kickstarter,

110
00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:26.010
but we had talked about it,

111
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.252
because Sam offered it up spontaneously--

112
00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:32.454
for our Kickstarter campaign earlier this year

113
00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:34.476
for The Legend of Vox Machina

114
00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:37.116
and we took Travis through the

115
00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:40.577
Fear Gate haunted house in Simi Valley

116
00:04:40.577 --> 00:04:43.979
and filmed it for our and your pleasure.

117
00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.224
LAURA: Mostly our, let's be honest.

118
00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:46.965
MATT: Mostly ours, yeah.

119
00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:48.928
If you missed the video, stick around for the break

120
00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:51.834
or check it out on YouTube at our YouTube channel.

121
00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:52.996
Once again, huge thanks to all of our

122
00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:55.525
fantastic Kickstarter supporters for allowing

123
00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:56.703
this crazy series to come together

124
00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:59.465
and for this man to be punished for all of our enjoyment.

125
00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.190
TRAVIS: It's okay, you don't need to see it.

126
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.205
TALIESIN: That's a good warning there, is during the break

127
00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:04.386
there will be scary clowns,

128
00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:07.647
so if you have a problem with some scary clowns,

129
00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:09.496
probably walk away for about ten minutes.

130
00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:11.563
MATT: Fair enough, good call on that, Taliesin.

131
00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.871
TRAVIS: Why couldn't I get that warning?

132
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:15.508
MARISHA: The funny outweighs the scary.

133
00:05:15.508 --> 00:05:17.051
MATT: Generally.

134
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.163
Laura, you had some announcements?

135
00:05:18.163 --> 00:05:20.104
LAURA: Oh, why yes I do.

136
00:05:21.013 --> 00:05:22.933
Check out this!

137
00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:25.229
TALIESIN: What is happening?

138
00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.723
LAURA: No, I did this other day, I told him to move cameras.

139
00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:29.272
Look at these pins, you guys!

140
00:05:29.272 --> 00:05:30.668
ALL: Oh!

141
00:05:30.668 --> 00:05:33.135
LAURA: So we've got these amazing

142
00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:36.921
chibi pins, part of our amazing series

143
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:38.662
that we're doing of chibi pins

144
00:05:38.662 --> 00:05:41.277
and those are designed by the wonderful Jenny Park.

145
00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:43.248
And then on the other side, you can see

146
00:05:43.248 --> 00:05:46.912
our Mighty Nein crest and our Vox Machina crest.

147
00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:49.095
And the Mighty Nein crest as seen behind Matt Mercer

148
00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:52.348
was designed by Crystal Sharp, who is phenomenal,

149
00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:55.977
and you can check them out in our store right now.

150
00:05:55.977 --> 00:05:57.437
TRAVIS: So awesome.
MARISHA: So cute!

151
00:05:57.437 --> 00:05:58.635
TRAVIS: We saw so many Critters in New York

152
00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:00.078
and they were rocking these pins,

153
00:06:00.078 --> 00:06:01.530
and we immediately grabbed them

154
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.429
and smothered them with love.

155
00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.404
LAURA: I am very excited about the chibi line,

156
00:06:05.404 --> 00:06:06.637
I'm very excited.

157
00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:09.167
MATT: Fantastic, yeah. I'm really excited about

158
00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:10.367

(fire whooshes)

197
00:07:52.854 --> 00:07:54.236
MATT: And welcome back.

198
00:07:54.236 --> 00:07:57.859
So, last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

199
00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:00.510
having long lost one of their compatriots,

200
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.112
Yasha, to the will of some entity or cult

201
00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:07.148
under the name the Angel of Irons.

202
00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:09.380
You've been seeking out the individual, Obann,

203
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.463
who seems to be gathering figures of Exandria's past,

204
00:08:13.463 --> 00:08:15.910
champions of the Betrayers.

205
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.669
Having collected one called the Laughing Hand,

206
00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:20.929
unintentionally with your aid,

207
00:08:20.929 --> 00:08:23.364
you began to hunt down the next venture

208
00:08:23.364 --> 00:08:26.597
after an attack on the Cobalt Soul's archive in Zadash,

209
00:08:26.597 --> 00:08:31.597
discovering the intent of Obann to raise another champion,

210
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:34.825
apparently one known as the--

211
00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:35.725
LAURA: The Inevitable End.

212
00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:39.205
MATT: The Inevitable End, there you go.

213
00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.911
Yes, the Caedogeist.

214
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:45.451
You transported through the aid of your ally,

215
00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:50.086
Shadowhand Essek, to the center of the Lotusden Greenwood,

216
00:08:50.086 --> 00:08:53.123
where you managed to work your way

217
00:08:53.123 --> 00:08:56.724
pretty much at the same pace or overtake

218
00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:58.728
their trudging towards the Wraithroot Tree,

219
00:08:58.728 --> 00:09:01.422
which you had discovered held the last portion

220
00:09:01.422 --> 00:09:05.830
of the long-sealed entity, this Caedogeist.

221
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.656
Unfortunately, crashing through the trees was enough to

222
00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:11.557
alert them of your presence and a

223
00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:14.541
pre-dawn chase took place thereafter

224
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:16.092
upon which you had managed to

225
00:09:16.092 --> 00:09:17.849
temporarily charm the Laughing Hand

226
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.909
and sent him off the scent.

227
00:09:20.909 --> 00:09:23.416
Chasing down Yasha and Obann to the Wraithroot Tree,

228
00:09:23.416 --> 00:09:26.041
Obann, through a very lucky roll,

229
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:27.751
managed to draw the heart from

230
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:30.167
the center of the tree that he required

231
00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:35.167
and a failed attempt to pick the skull from his side

232
00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:39.426
meant that he had acquired both artifacts he required.

233
00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:42.114
Reaching down, grabbing Yasha

234
00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:45.031
in all of her fallen aasimar glory,

235
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:48.241
they both vanished.

236
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:52.699
Leaving you to deal with the Wraithroot Tree.

237
00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:55.686
Fleeing from the center of this darkened,

238
00:09:55.686 --> 00:09:59.421
pre-sunrise battlefield, you

239
00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:02.815
teleported yourselves towards the capital

240
00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:07.537
Dynasty city of Rosohna, where you, The Mighty Nein,

241
00:10:07.537 --> 00:10:11.625
have to figure out the next step in your journey.

242
00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:13.786
Returning to the center of

243
00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:17.301
the dark elf city here in Xhorhas.

244
00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:20.909
Quietly trudging your way past the guards

245
00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:22.097
who have become familiar with your

246
00:10:22.097 --> 00:10:24.445
comings and goings by this time,

247
00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:26.763
you make your way quietly back

248
00:10:26.763 --> 00:10:28.344
in the wee hours of the morning

249
00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:30.919
to your home in the Firmaments.

250
00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:35.222
Entering your abode, the Xhorhaus,

251
00:10:35.222 --> 00:10:37.669
you close the door behind,

252
00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:38.976
and exhale for what seems like

253
00:10:38.976 --> 00:10:41.809
the first time since your arrival.

254
00:10:44.153 --> 00:10:46.885
MARISHA: Well, that fucking sucked.

255
00:10:46.885 --> 00:10:51.213
SAM: I mean, to be fair, we got very, very close.

256
00:10:51.213 --> 00:10:54.726
LAURA: And then we got our asses handed to us.

257
00:10:54.726 --> 00:10:58.440
MARISHA: I'm really fucking tired of
shit running away from us.

258
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.165
That's happened a lot.
SAM: I'm tired of losing.

259
00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:01.998
MARISHA: Yeah.

260
00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:05.716
LAURA: Is it us, you guys?

261
00:11:05.716 --> 00:11:06.549
SAM: Maybe.

262
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.471
TRAVIS: What do you mean?
MARISHA: I kind of think so.

263
00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:11.295
LAURA: Maybe, we thought we were badass

264
00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:13.318
and maybe we're not badass.

265
00:11:13.318 --> 00:11:17.289
MARISHA: Oh, I was kind of thinking that people hate us.

266
00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:18.936
LAURA: Oh, well.

267
00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:22.080
MARISHA: But that might also be part of it.

268
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.649
LAURA: I guess people, yeah, they don't like us.

269
00:11:25.649 --> 00:11:27.053
TALIESIN: Well...

270
00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:30.554
TRAVIS: We also don't really belong anywhere.

271
00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:32.588
Keep moving so much.

272
00:11:32.588 --> 00:11:35.826
I don't know if we're not badass, we're just

273
00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:37.076
not very lucky.

274
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:40.642
SAM: Well, it's not like we

275
00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:43.394
we set out to do any of this, right?

276
00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:48.394
We were thrust into this, and have been finding our way

277
00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:50.500
as we've been going, but

278
00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:54.665
the only real consistency is that

279
00:11:54.665 --> 00:11:57.832
we've been doing this together, but...

280
00:11:59.187 --> 00:12:00.514
LIAM: I think we have spent a long time

281
00:12:00.514 --> 00:12:04.228
just learning how to trust each other somewhat.

282
00:12:04.228 --> 00:12:05.478
Maybe it's time

283
00:12:07.239 --> 00:12:11.865
we trust someone else.

284
00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.584
SAM: Who?
TALIESIN: Exactly my thought.

285
00:12:14.584 --> 00:12:15.767
We've been

286
00:12:17.355 --> 00:12:18.907
managing our own problems

287
00:12:18.907 --> 00:12:21.672
and our own expectations, and

288
00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:24.922
just asking people

289
00:12:26.194 --> 00:12:27.784
to let us wander in and out

290
00:12:27.784 --> 00:12:31.942
of what they need with no real commitment,

291
00:12:31.942 --> 00:12:33.317
no humility.

292
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.926
SAM: So you're saying we align with Obann

293
00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:40.817
and destroy the world?

294
00:12:40.817 --> 00:12:42.149
LAURA: I mean, he's really powerful.

295
00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:43.379
SAM: He's very powerful.
LAURA: If you're going to do it,

296
00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:44.654
he's the person to do it with.

297
00:12:44.654 --> 00:12:46.605
SAM: Seems like he's winning.
LAURA: He's got Yasha on his side.

298
00:12:46.605 --> 00:12:48.044
SAM: I always bet on the winner.

299
00:12:48.044 --> 00:12:52.237
TRAVIS: Not what I think what
Caduceus or Caleb was talking about.

300
00:12:52.237 --> 00:12:55.483
MARISHA: I mean, it could be a free trip
to the plane of the Abyss.

301
00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.644
We could travel, you know?

302
00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.926
SAM: What were you thinking, gentlemen?

303
00:13:00.926 --> 00:13:02.759
TALIESIN: There's a...

304
00:13:06.193 --> 00:13:09.133
There's a tiny bird.

305
00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:10.071
LAURA: A hummingbird!

306
00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:12.232
TALIESIN: Well, it's even--
LAURA: A sparrow!

307
00:13:12.232 --> 00:13:13.857
TALIESIN: There's a tiny bird--
LAURA: A canary?

308
00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:15.393
TALIESIN: -- that live on the back--
LAURA: A finch?

309
00:13:15.393 --> 00:13:18.360
TALIESIN: -- of larger animals and eat the bugs that live

310
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.007
on the specific larger animals.

311
00:13:21.007 --> 00:13:22.959
There's rhinoceroses and otherwise.

312
00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:24.975
And the birds require the insects that live

313
00:13:24.975 --> 00:13:27.281
on this specific animal and the insects require

314
00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:29.614
the animal that they sit on.

315
00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:34.872
I think we need an ecosystem, I think we need somewhere

316
00:13:34.872 --> 00:13:38.260
that feeds us and supports us and I think we need allies.

317
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.666
Real allies, people that we've invested in,

318
00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:41.766
other than ourselves.

319
00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:43.274
LAURA: We need a rhinoceros.

320
00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:44.841
TALIESIN: We need a rhinoceros.

321
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:47.765
LIAM: We are fairly capable people, but

322
00:13:47.765 --> 00:13:51.048
the forces in play are larger than us.

323
00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:56.238
Two separate nations, and whatever this goose chase is

324
00:13:56.238 --> 00:14:00.546
that we have been hunting down across the continent,

325
00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:02.046
for weeks, months,

326
00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:06.368
I can't keep up with Obann.

327
00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:08.701
LAURA: None of us can, obviously!

328
00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:14.352
TALIESIN: I don't know if either of these two groups

329
00:14:14.352 --> 00:14:16.358
are going to be able to turn away from their own interests

330
00:14:16.358 --> 00:14:18.770
long enough to see the bigger picture, I don't know.

331
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.074
But we need to invest in somebody

332
00:14:21.074 --> 00:14:23.235
and hope that they invest in what we see.

333
00:14:23.235 --> 00:14:24.305
LAURA: We need to find somebody

334
00:14:24.305 --> 00:14:27.305
that doesn't have that-- what?

335
00:14:28.257 --> 00:14:29.986
TRAVIS: You're talking about a third party?

336
00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:33.170
Someone outside of the Dynasty or the Empire?

337
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.067
TALIESIN: Someone like us.

338
00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:36.406
MARISHA: I mean, we've tried to talk to the Dynasty

339
00:14:36.406 --> 00:14:39.689
and they brush it off and say we're at a war.

340
00:14:39.689 --> 00:14:43.330
Talk to the Empire, and they've done the same thing.

341
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.330
I mean, the Cobalt Soul, who I thought was supposed to

342
00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:51.328
listen to me, they didn't offer any help.

343
00:14:51.328 --> 00:14:52.984
LAURA: They don't like us.
SAM: They fucking hate us.

344
00:14:52.984 --> 00:14:55.052
LAURA: Well, I mean, to be fair, we kind of

345
00:14:55.052 --> 00:14:57.804
screwed with them just a little.

346
00:14:57.804 --> 00:15:01.302
SAM: That is fair, I think you don't even have to

347
00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:03.698
remind us of that, we have pissed off everybody.

348
00:15:03.698 --> 00:15:05.419
LAURA: I've still got holes in both of my--

349
00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:07.871
TALIESIN: I think it's important to
remind us, actually, yeah.

350
00:15:07.871 --> 00:15:09.067
You're, oh god.

351
00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:12.861
LAURA: Yeah, I'll get this dress cleaned eventually.

352
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:15.194
LIAM: There is maybe some use in

353
00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:19.098
dancing with the one we brought

354
00:15:19.098 --> 00:15:23.717
and talk to Essek or the Queen herself, probably Essek.

355
00:15:23.717 --> 00:15:26.717
And see if we are done being vetted.

356
00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.549
If we can get some assistance in the way that

357
00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:34.330
we think would be useful, or to get them to pay attention.

358
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.219
To what we seem to be the only ones

359
00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:38.206
who are paying attention to.

360
00:15:38.206 --> 00:15:41.880
TALIESIN: Be honest, what's the worst that could happen?

361
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.880
Either we die alone or we die as a part of something.

362
00:15:46.888 --> 00:15:48.252
TRAVIS: I feel like we've produced nothing,

363
00:15:48.252 --> 00:15:50.584
I feel like we're going to continue to be ignored.

364
00:15:50.584 --> 00:15:54.341
We should tell Essek and we have an enormous debt to pay,

365
00:15:54.341 --> 00:15:56.061
as he likes to remind us, but

366
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:58.640
who would this third party be

367
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.165
if we were going to find someone

368
00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:02.903
outside of the Empire, outside of the Dynasty?

369
00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:04.963
TALIESIN: Other than your mom, I suppose.

370
00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:06.444
LIAM: We go to Nicodranas.

371
00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:08.227
LAURA: The wizard?

372
00:16:08.227 --> 00:16:10.301
LIAM: Yussa.
LAURA: Yussa!

373
00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:11.886
TRAVIS: Who?
LIAM: Yussa.

374
00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:14.753
LAURA: That guy in Nicodranas, he has the big tower.

375
00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:16.406
MARISHA: That we gave the Happy Fun Ball to.

376
00:16:16.406 --> 00:16:18.634
TALIESIN: You were really good in there.

377
00:16:18.634 --> 00:16:20.847
LAURA: You were!
MARISHA: Thanks.

378
00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:24.741
LAURA: Oh, you were, and you were, both of you were.

379
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:26.405
TRAVIS: In where?

380
00:16:26.405 --> 00:16:27.965
MARISHA: In the Happy Fun Ball?

381
00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:29.310
TALIESIN: I meant in the tower.

382
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.330
MARISHA: Oh that's right, we talked to him, yeah.

383
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.568
TRAVIS: I totally remember that.

384
00:16:34.568 --> 00:16:36.059
TALIESIN: You did the one thing we haven't done since,

385
00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:39.204
which is actually practice a little humility and honesty.

386
00:16:39.204 --> 00:16:42.062
MARISHA: Yeah, that was the last time we did that.

387
00:16:42.062 --> 00:16:45.691
LAURA: Hey, maybe that's why he didn't hate us immediately.

388
00:16:45.691 --> 00:16:47.772
SAM: We also gave him a shiny present.

389
00:16:47.772 --> 00:16:49.022
LAURA: That is true.

390
00:16:51.252 --> 00:16:54.076
TRAVIS: What shiny present?
MARISHA: The Happy Fun Ball!

391
00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:56.230
TRAVIS: Yes, no, I'm tracking all of this.

392
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.369
SAM: Do you have a concussion?

393
00:16:57.369 --> 00:17:00.196
MARISHA: Did you lose your memory with your class?

394
00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:03.231
TRAVIS: I got dropped through those branches
real fucking hard.

395
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.045
LAURA: Sorry about that, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Got a little bit of a

396
00:17:05.045 --> 00:17:07.974
stuffy sound in here and little bit of a dark spot.

397
00:17:07.974 --> 00:17:09.107
(laughter)

398
00:17:09.107 --> 00:17:12.274
LAURA: I saw one big branch smack you right upside the head

399
00:17:12.274 --> 00:17:13.933
and I wasn't going to say anything.

400
00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:14.766
TRAVIS: A big nap!

401
00:17:14.766 --> 00:17:17.046
SAM: Do you have a last name and you just can't remember it?

402
00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:17.979
Is that what it is?

403
00:17:17.979 --> 00:17:20.421
TRAVIS: (burbling)

404
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:21.562
LAURA: (laughs)

405
00:17:23.305 --> 00:17:24.434
SAM: All right, so.

406
00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:26.182
LIAM: Any of these parties are a gamble.

407
00:17:26.182 --> 00:17:29.728
The question is which is the least risky?

408
00:17:29.728 --> 00:17:31.684
TALIESIN: And can we commit to it?

409
00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:34.959
LAURA: I think we should

410
00:17:34.959 --> 00:17:37.659
commit to something.

411
00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:40.792
Honestly, this back and forth,

412
00:17:43.032 --> 00:17:45.174
this playing secrets--

413
00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:50.725
MARISHA: The jet lag is really starting to catch up to me.

414
00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:52.225
LIAM: That's too real.

415
00:17:55.052 --> 00:17:58.611
SAM: So, to lay out a plan of action.

416
00:17:58.611 --> 00:18:00.444
Are we going to report in with Essek?

417
00:18:00.444 --> 00:18:05.082
Or are we just going to jump to the wizard?

418
00:18:05.082 --> 00:18:08.207
LAURA: I think we should tell Essek at least about

419
00:18:08.207 --> 00:18:12.247
I mean, it's in their world now, right?

420
00:18:12.247 --> 00:18:13.714
TRAVIS: The last known sighting was, yes.

421
00:18:13.714 --> 00:18:15.193
I think we should at least--

422
00:18:15.193 --> 00:18:16.499
MARISHA: Tell him that we fucked up?

423
00:18:16.499 --> 00:18:19.812
TRAVIS: Lay it at his feet and see what he does with it.

424
00:18:19.812 --> 00:18:22.575
MARISHA: Yeah, it could be his last chance

425
00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:23.866
to pay any type of mind to it.

426
00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:26.104
If he shrugs us off after we say they got away--

427
00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:27.021
TRAVIS: Fuck him!

428
00:18:29.473 --> 00:18:32.573
LIAM: And maybe

429
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.866
he will surprise us, maybe--

430
00:18:34.866 --> 00:18:36.186
SAM: Can you heal him?

431
00:18:36.186 --> 00:18:38.183
(laughter)

432
00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:41.129
TALIESIN: I don't know if there's any fixing that.

433
00:18:41.129 --> 00:18:45.120
SAM: Oh no, he's got blood coming out of his ears!

434
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.370
(laughter)

435
00:18:48.681 --> 00:18:51.490
LAURA: His intelligence goes down to six.

436
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.489
TRAVIS: (laughing slows down)

437
00:18:54.489 --> 00:18:59.227
TALIESIN: We know also that there's people working against

438
00:18:59.227 --> 00:19:02.144
the Empire within the Empire.

439
00:19:02.144 --> 00:19:05.031
We know that trust is going to be hard in here,

440
00:19:05.031 --> 00:19:07.814
but we've got to tell somebody something.

441
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.595
LAURA: Do we tell him now or do we tell him in the morning?

442
00:19:10.595 --> 00:19:12.353
TALIESIN: I say we tell him in the morning.

443
00:19:12.353 --> 00:19:15.126
TRAVIS: I would second that.

444
00:19:15.126 --> 00:19:16.770
MARISHA: Actually gives me a chance to check in

445
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.807
and see what Dairon's been up to for the past three weeks.

446
00:19:20.807 --> 00:19:22.688
TRAVIS: Yeah, two and a half, three?

447
00:19:22.688 --> 00:19:24.214
SAM: If they're here.

448
00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.803
MARISHA: Yeah.

449
00:19:25.803 --> 00:19:27.451
SAM: Hello?

450
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:28.370
Anybody home?

451
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.738
LAURA: Dairon could be listening
MARISHA: We're walking and talking.

452
00:19:30.738 --> 00:19:32.813
(knocking)

453
00:19:32.813 --> 00:19:35.516
MATT: A brief moment passes before eventually

454
00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:38.183
you hear no footsteps, but see a shadow appear

455
00:19:38.183 --> 00:19:40.381
at the top of steps before Dairon

456
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:43.903
in full dark elf visual regalia

457
00:19:43.903 --> 00:19:45.977
descends the stairs.

458
00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:48.660
"Ah, you return.

459
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.783
"What news is there of your goings about?"

460
00:19:51.783 --> 00:19:52.616
TALIESIN: Oof.

461
00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:55.374
SAM: We can skip that, pretty much.

462
00:19:55.374 --> 00:19:57.766
MATT: "Fair enough, not a problem."

463
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.192
SAM: What's been going on here?

464
00:20:01.192 --> 00:20:04.192
MATT: "I have been doing my research, and

465
00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:10.517
"well, my suspicions have been at least loosely confirmed.

466
00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:14.471
"I believe I have found traces that

467
00:20:14.471 --> 00:20:18.146
"the beacon that started this war was not

468
00:20:18.146 --> 00:20:19.528
"taken by the Empire,

469
00:20:19.528 --> 00:20:24.403
"but was indeed given by an agent within--"

470
00:20:24.403 --> 00:20:27.070
SAM: Oh! Oh.
MATT: "-- the Dynasty."

471
00:20:28.868 --> 00:20:30.095
LAURA: Do you know who?

472
00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:31.927
TRAVIS: Or to what end?
MATT: "I do not."

473
00:20:31.927 --> 00:20:33.435
SAM: And not with the permission of

474
00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:35.049
the Bright Queen herself.

475
00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:38.203
It was was secreted away.

476
00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:41.815
MATT: "I would assume as such and would not confirm,

477
00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:44.584
"as to ask such questions would raise

478
00:20:44.584 --> 00:20:47.159
"too much suspicion on myself.

479
00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:49.168
"And I'm already riding the line."

480
00:20:49.168 --> 00:20:52.270
MARISHA: Unless they were looking for
an excuse to start a war.

481
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.603
TRAVIS: Did you get the impression this was recent or old?

482
00:20:57.975 --> 00:21:02.118
MATT: "This would have had to have happened

483
00:21:02.118 --> 00:21:03.368
"a year or more."

484
00:21:05.127 --> 00:21:09.144
LAURA: Who was it? I wonder it's somebody we met! (gasps)

485
00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:11.594
SAM: It has to be. The people who have access to that

486
00:21:11.594 --> 00:21:14.240
rare an artifact could only be the Bright Queen

487
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.381
and those in her inner circle.

488
00:21:16.381 --> 00:21:19.176
The heads of the dens?
LAURA: It was the old lady!

489
00:21:19.176 --> 00:21:20.642
SAM: The den mothers!
LAURA: I know it was!

490
00:21:20.642 --> 00:21:21.604
It was the old one.

491
00:21:21.604 --> 00:21:22.668
SAM: The old one, the goblin one?

492
00:21:22.668 --> 00:21:23.685
LAURA: Yeah, that's the one!

493
00:21:23.685 --> 00:21:26.573
SAM: I fucking hate goblins!
LAURA: I knew it was her!

494
00:21:26.573 --> 00:21:29.812
I said, is she good or bad? I don't understand

495
00:21:29.812 --> 00:21:32.823
who's the good person, who's the bad person?

496
00:21:32.823 --> 00:21:34.411
SAM: Just in general?

497
00:21:34.411 --> 00:21:36.932
LAURA: Kind of.
SAM: Like in life?

498
00:21:36.932 --> 00:21:38.394
LAURA: Well, like if she took it from the Dynasty

499
00:21:38.394 --> 00:21:40.344
and gave it to the Empire, is that bad?

500
00:21:40.344 --> 00:21:41.637
Or did she do it because she's good?

501
00:21:41.637 --> 00:21:42.956
SAM: No, I think it's bad, I think it's bad.

502
00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:45.547
LAURA: Oh, I knew it.
SAM: Yeah!

503
00:21:45.547 --> 00:21:46.872
LIAM: It's bad.

504
00:21:48.942 --> 00:21:50.948
(laughter)

505
00:21:50.948 --> 00:21:54.302
MATT: "The other aspect of this,

506
00:21:54.302 --> 00:21:58.352
"and part of the reason why I am still awake

507
00:21:59.362 --> 00:22:01.362
"is in finding this information,

508
00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:04.829
"I was nearly found and apprehended.

509
00:22:06.055 --> 00:22:07.916
"And I am hoping that I have not lead a trace

510
00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:08.999
"back to this house."

511
00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:10.949
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh!

512
00:22:12.323 --> 00:22:14.941
MARISHA: Why would you-- what? Why would you come back here

513
00:22:14.941 --> 00:22:16.805
if you thought you were being followed?

514
00:22:16.805 --> 00:22:18.256
MATT: "I wasn't here. I was on another roof,

515
00:22:18.256 --> 00:22:21.756
"but I saw you enter and begin to call out."

516
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.495
MARISHA: I'm going to go peek the windows,
I'm going to start--

517
00:22:26.495 --> 00:22:28.114
TRAVIS: I'll head up to the rooftop.

518
00:22:28.114 --> 00:22:28.947
MARISHA: I'm closing curtains.

519
00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:31.083
LAURA: Should we just pretend everything's normal?

520
00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:31.916
Should we just pretend like

521
00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:34.326
we're having a party or something?

522
00:22:34.326 --> 00:22:35.681
SAM: I'm going to knock over a chair!

523
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:37.075
(laughter)

524
00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:39.006
LAURA: I'm going to start dancing, I don't know.

525
00:22:39.006 --> 00:22:42.502
I'm just dancing in the living room.

526
00:22:42.502 --> 00:22:45.815
MARISHA: Ahhh, what do I see when I look out the window?

527
00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:46.770
MATT: Make a perception check!

528
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.603
MARISHA: Okay!

529
00:22:47.603 --> 00:22:49.786
SAM: Dancing in the living room, I imagine like

530
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.047
in "Home Alone," where it's like two

531
00:22:52.047 --> 00:22:53.894
two mannequins that are just...

532
00:22:53.894 --> 00:22:55.576
TRAVIS: Can I make a rooftop check?

533
00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:57.189
MATT: Yes, you may.
MARISHA: 15.

534
00:22:57.189 --> 00:23:00.856
MATT: All right, and perception for you as well.

535
00:23:02.142 --> 00:23:03.581
TRAVIS: 17.

536
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:04.999
LAURA: Would you like a performance check?

537
00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:07.559
MATT: Sure, please.
LAURA: Okay.

538
00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:08.392
Oh good.

539
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.796
TALIESIN: Get that out of your system now.
LAURA: Three!

540
00:23:11.796 --> 00:23:13.488
MATT: With disadvantage, because there's no music.

541
00:23:13.488 --> 00:23:14.919
(laughter)

542
00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:19.169
LAURA: Still three, still three.
MATT: There you go. (laughs)

543
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:23.667
Much like the wonderful

544
00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:25.696
Lorde song "Liability,"

545
00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.813
you stand there dancing with yourself

546
00:23:27.813 --> 00:23:31.237
in quiet desperation.
TALIESIN: Don't pop and lock.

547
00:23:31.237 --> 00:23:33.879
(laughter)

548
00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:36.192
TALIESIN: It's the dad joke of dancing.

549
00:23:36.192 --> 00:23:38.908
LAURA: I rolled a three, I have to pop and lock!

550
00:23:38.908 --> 00:23:41.268
TRAVIS: I must pop and lock!

551
00:23:41.268 --> 00:23:42.721
SAM: And a poop and a look.

552
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.526
LIAM: I'm seeing a Molly Ringwald Breakfast Club

553
00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:46.430
kind of dance.
LAURA: No, that's too good.

554
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.579
For a three, that's too good for a three.

555
00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:53.758
MATT: Keeping an eye out for a quiet ten or minutes

556
00:23:53.758 --> 00:23:58.425
among the streets, you can see there are wandering guards

557
00:23:59.711 --> 00:24:02.826
of Rosohna doing their usual path,

558
00:24:02.826 --> 00:24:05.865
but you do not see any strange foot traffic

559
00:24:05.865 --> 00:24:07.360
or anything moving in your direction

560
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.498
that would spike your alarm.

561
00:24:10.498 --> 00:24:11.447
MARISHA: Do we have a cellar?

562
00:24:11.447 --> 00:24:12.974
We've got a dung- right?

563
00:24:12.974 --> 00:24:13.807
We got a basement?

564
00:24:13.807 --> 00:24:15.042
LAURA: We've got a jacuzzi.

565
00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:16.474
TALIESIN: We could empty it.

566
00:24:16.474 --> 00:24:17.679
LAURA: Or we could go sit in it.

567
00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:20.526
I mean, we all could use--
TALIESIN: Actually use the jacuzzi.

568
00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:22.358
I'm going to go set that up right now.

569
00:24:22.358 --> 00:24:24.953
TRAVIS: Can I summon the Star Razor in my hand?

570
00:24:24.953 --> 00:24:26.090
MATT: Yep.

571
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.824
TRAVIS: Can I use one of its abilities, See Invisibility?

572
00:24:29.824 --> 00:24:31.736
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: Yes, you may.

573
00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.212
LAURA: You have an ability to do that?

574
00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:36.344
TRAVIS: And can I scan?
MARISHA: I know, that's new!

575
00:24:36.344 --> 00:24:38.395
MATT: Looking around, you do not see

576
00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:40.490
anything invisible within the radius

577
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.338
of what you're able to see.

578
00:24:42.338 --> 00:24:44.641
So you feel a little more confident and a little more

579
00:24:44.641 --> 00:24:49.641
assured that at least there is no unseen peering near you.

580
00:24:49.932 --> 00:24:51.145
TRAVIS: Okay.

581
00:24:51.145 --> 00:24:52.803
It lasts for...

582
00:24:53.885 --> 00:24:56.914
one hour, shit, okay, so I'll just walk around

583
00:24:56.914 --> 00:24:58.196
the inside of the house as well,

584
00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:00.671
and make sure no one snuck in after Dairon.

585
00:25:00.671 --> 00:25:02.149
MARISHA: I'm going to do a patrol as well.

586
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:04.266
I'm going to just do a patrol for a little bit.

587
00:25:04.266 --> 00:25:06.677
TALIESIN: Getting a really nice hot tub time coming up.

588
00:25:06.677 --> 00:25:08.639
TRAVIS: Big fuck-off sword at my side.

589
00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:10.366
SAM: Just dance?

590
00:25:10.366 --> 00:25:14.582
LIAM: I will tell Frumpkin to mirror Beau a few--

591
00:25:14.582 --> 00:25:16.416
are you outside?

592
00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:18.240
MARISHA: I'm inside, doing a patrol.

593
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.629
LIAM: Frumpkin will sit in the tree,

594
00:25:20.629 --> 00:25:23.296
and slowly walk around the tree

595
00:25:23.296 --> 00:25:25.256
and look for anybody fucking with the house.

596
00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:27.202
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Or anybody fucking.

597
00:25:27.202 --> 00:25:28.893
MATT: (laughs)

598
00:25:28.893 --> 00:25:30.526
LAURA: He can see a lot from that tree.

599
00:25:30.526 --> 00:25:33.457
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: Fair enough.

600
00:25:33.457 --> 00:25:36.076
SAM: Is there anything else, Dairon, that we should know?

601
00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:38.962
Any details of where or how you learned this information?

602
00:25:38.962 --> 00:25:41.780
Where did you learn this information?

603
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.356
MATT: "I've been following and asking questions

604
00:25:43.356 --> 00:25:46.351
"about individuals who have been traveling

605
00:25:46.351 --> 00:25:48.360
"for extended periods of time,

606
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.866
"moving or adjusting the placement of these beacons.

607
00:25:51.866 --> 00:25:55.159
"I've had to masquerade as a few different individuals

608
00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:57.575
"to make my way into some of these avenues."

609
00:25:57.575 --> 00:25:59.280
LAURA: That's scary!

610
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.682
MATT: "You don't know the half of it.

611
00:26:00.682 --> 00:26:04.349
"But this is the job that we are trained for."

612
00:26:05.246 --> 00:26:06.829
SAM: So much training.

613
00:26:07.782 --> 00:26:10.302
MATT: "I've come to understand that the last time

614
00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:14.852
"the beacon was under the watch of anyone

615
00:26:14.852 --> 00:26:18.808
"before it was said to have gone missing,

616
00:26:18.808 --> 00:26:22.633
"all of the paperwork and records of its movement

617
00:26:22.633 --> 00:26:25.766
"have been destroyed internally.

618
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:31.431
"Someone is covering a trail of this."

619
00:26:33.732 --> 00:26:34.565
SAM: Okay.

620
00:26:36.164 --> 00:26:39.119
MATT: "However, the longer I am here,

621
00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:43.224
"the more I put all of you and what you are doing in danger.

622
00:26:43.224 --> 00:26:46.119
"So I think I may be heading back

623
00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:48.031
"to the Cobalt Soul myself."

624
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:48.864
LAURA: Oh wow.

625
00:26:50.268 --> 00:26:52.487
MARISHA: If you're going there,

626
00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:54.320
could you like

627
00:26:55.396 --> 00:26:58.376
tell them I'm cool and an expositor?

628
00:26:58.376 --> 00:27:00.601
And um...

629
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:03.835
if they could lift the ban on us?

630
00:27:03.835 --> 00:27:04.668
MATT: "Excuse me?"

631
00:27:04.668 --> 00:27:05.831
LAURA: Rexxentrum and Port Damali both.

632
00:27:05.831 --> 00:27:07.553
MARISHA: Yeah, Port Damali.

633
00:27:07.553 --> 00:27:09.650
If you could, like, do that?

634
00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:14.009
MATT: "What-- I'm not even going to ask."

635
00:27:14.009 --> 00:27:15.842
LAURA: But you can do that, you can get the bans

636
00:27:15.842 --> 00:27:18.296
lifted probably, though?

637
00:27:18.296 --> 00:27:20.204
TALIESIN: I would do that after you've given them the

638
00:27:20.204 --> 00:27:22.187
good news of all the information that you have here.

639
00:27:22.187 --> 00:27:23.965
MATT: "I think you are very wise

640
00:27:23.965 --> 00:27:26.361
"to have this mindset.

641
00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:30.303
"I'll see what I can do, as I know you are prone to

642
00:27:30.303 --> 00:27:34.845
"very curious means of reaching the ends of your quest."

643
00:27:34.845 --> 00:27:36.431
LAURA: All a huge misunderstanding.

644
00:27:36.431 --> 00:27:38.431
MATT: "I'm sure it is.

645
00:27:39.397 --> 00:27:41.280
"I will do my best.

646
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.067
"I will inform of your particular advancement,

647
00:27:45.067 --> 00:27:48.955
"as I have been intending to and that should help."

648
00:27:48.955 --> 00:27:51.173
TRAVIS: Would it be too much to ask how or who

649
00:27:51.173 --> 00:27:53.706
you were speaking with or overheard

650
00:27:53.706 --> 00:27:56.136
discussing this information with?

651
00:27:56.136 --> 00:27:59.131
SAM: Just so we can rule them out.

652
00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:00.536
MATT: "To who I'm speaking?"

653
00:28:00.536 --> 00:28:04.775
TRAVIS: Yeah, from whom did you learn that this transpired?

654
00:28:04.775 --> 00:28:06.772
Or was it just in research and then--

655
00:28:06.772 --> 00:28:09.245
MATT: "This was in research. This was in getting--

656
00:28:09.245 --> 00:28:13.337
"bypassing the various guardians of the interior

657
00:28:13.337 --> 00:28:17.320
"chamber, note-taking, and record-keeping."

658
00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:20.931
At this point in time,

659
00:28:20.931 --> 00:28:22.630
you in particular, Travis,

660
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.262
glancing up to the top of the stairs,

661
00:28:25.262 --> 00:28:27.343
just from watching about, there's this faint little

662
00:28:27.343 --> 00:28:31.212
glowing orb that's been coasting along the ceiling,

663
00:28:31.212 --> 00:28:33.738
gently floats down.
TRAVIS: Is it invisible?

664
00:28:33.738 --> 00:28:36.335
LAURA: Oh, it's an invisible orb, everybody stop talking.

665
00:28:36.335 --> 00:28:38.209
(quiet dithering)

666
00:28:38.209 --> 00:28:43.174
TRAVIS: (sighs) Perhaps it would be wise for us to not say

667
00:28:43.174 --> 00:28:45.880
any more about this this evening.

668
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.866
Would anyone care to join me up on the roof

669
00:28:47.866 --> 00:28:49.742
for perhaps a beverage.

670
00:28:49.742 --> 00:28:51.361
Now.

671
00:28:51.361 --> 00:28:52.816
TALIESIN: I would have headed up there anyway.

672
00:28:52.816 --> 00:28:56.973
TRAVIS: Just insist if you could all,
perhaps, join me immediately.

673
00:28:56.973 --> 00:28:58.248
Upstairs.

674
00:28:58.248 --> 00:28:59.467
MARISHA: I join immediately.
TALIESIN: I'm already walking.

675
00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:00.823
SAM: Sure, let's go.
LAURA: Yeah, lets,

676
00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:03.597
I dance up the stairs. Let's do it. It's a party

677
00:29:03.597 --> 00:29:05.787
after all, here, in this house.

678
00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:08.999
SAM: See you, Dairon.
LAURA: Just having a party.

679
00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.336
TRAVIS: So, we'll start heading up the stairs.

680
00:29:11.336 --> 00:29:13.550
MARISHA: Don't use names!

681
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.918
(laughter)

682
00:29:15.918 --> 00:29:18.263
SAM: I'm sorry, Sally.
TRAVIS: Is it at the top of the

683
00:29:18.263 --> 00:29:20.295
the first landing?
MATT: Yeah.

684
00:29:20.295 --> 00:29:21.481
When you first enter the building,

685
00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:24.767
where there's the main gathering area, the foyer,

686
00:29:24.767 --> 00:29:25.973
before you head up the stairs,

687
00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:28.249
it begins to coast its way down

688
00:29:28.249 --> 00:29:31.507
about a foot below the ceiling.

689
00:29:31.507 --> 00:29:34.423
It's just very slowly moving in the direction

690
00:29:34.423 --> 00:29:37.378
of where you all are, seemingly following the sound.

691
00:29:37.378 --> 00:29:42.369
TRAVIS: Once we get to a level that is
closer to it in distance,

692
00:29:43.693 --> 00:29:48.519
I'll reach out and I'll fire two Eldritch Blasts at it.

693
00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:49.827
MATT: Okay.

694
00:29:50.823 --> 00:29:53.791
Go ahead and roll two attack rolls for me.

695
00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:54.724
MARISHA: You know those videos of people

696
00:29:54.724 --> 00:29:57.733
shooting drones out of the sky?

697
00:29:57.733 --> 00:30:00.093
TALIESIN: Love the ren faire one where someone hits it with,

698
00:30:00.093 --> 00:30:01.819
they throw a lance--
LAURA: Do you think

699
00:30:01.819 --> 00:30:04.366
it'd be smart to just pretend just boring in here?

700
00:30:04.366 --> 00:30:05.808
SAM: Too late.

701
00:30:05.808 --> 00:30:08.844
TRAVIS: That's a 24.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

702
00:30:08.844 --> 00:30:09.761
TRAVIS: And a 15.

703
00:30:11.347 --> 00:30:13.455
MATT: 15, you fire two

704
00:30:13.455 --> 00:30:16.709
Eldritch Blasts as they both slam into the side of the wall,

705
00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:20.751
moving through this strange orb.

706
00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.681
You watch as the back portion of the wall behind it

707
00:30:25.681 --> 00:30:28.234
has two holes now blown into it

708
00:30:28.234 --> 00:30:31.815
from the force damage of the attack.

709
00:30:31.815 --> 00:30:34.032
LAURA: Oh, I saw that spider up there, too!

710
00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.314
Don't worry, I think you got it.

711
00:30:36.314 --> 00:30:38.683
TRAVIS: I say, I know that seemed odd.

712
00:30:38.683 --> 00:30:41.512
Maybe on the double if you could join me on the roof.

713
00:30:41.512 --> 00:30:42.958
SAM: Yeah, we were going to the roof anyway.

714
00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:44.701
TRAVIS: Yes, let's go.
TALIESIN: That was weird.

715
00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:47.227
MATT: It's changed direction and is now heading towards

716
00:30:47.227 --> 00:30:50.376
slowly the path you guys are taking.

717
00:30:50.376 --> 00:30:52.033
LAURA: Following us?
MATT: Yeah.

718
00:30:52.033 --> 00:30:54.263
TRAVIS: Jesus, I'm so nerv-- I'm like running!

719
00:30:54.263 --> 00:30:56.409
Come on, come on, fucking follow me!

720
00:30:56.409 --> 00:30:57.242
SAM: What are we running from?

721
00:30:57.242 --> 00:30:58.680
What's going on?
TRAVIS: Just running, running!

722
00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.598
Up on the roof!
SAM: (yells)

723
00:30:59.598 --> 00:31:01.928
TRAVIS: Come behind me, come behind me, come behind me!

724
00:31:01.928 --> 00:31:03.426
LIAM: We all run like idiots.

725
00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:04.944
MATT: You all catch up--

726
00:31:04.944 --> 00:31:06.558
TRAVIS: As we come up the stairs, do we see it?

727
00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:07.554
MATT: It's a ways behind you.

728
00:31:07.554 --> 00:31:09.118
TRAVIS: (whisper) I can see something
that's invisible.

729
00:31:09.118 --> 00:31:11.625
There's a glowing orb that's been
following us. I don't know.

730
00:31:11.625 --> 00:31:12.600
I tried to shoot it
LAURA: Is it like a scrying ball?

731
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.709
TRAVIS: I didn't hit it!

732
00:31:13.709 --> 00:31:14.542
SAM: A glowing orb?

733
00:31:14.542 --> 00:31:16.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like a glowing sphere,

734
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.673
but I tried to shoot it and it went right through it.

735
00:31:17.673 --> 00:31:19.063
LAURA: I bet it's spying on us.

736
00:31:19.063 --> 00:31:19.960
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

737
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.872
MATT: You do know from the times you've been scrying

738
00:31:21.872 --> 00:31:23.564
that the projection of your consciousness

739
00:31:23.564 --> 00:31:27.855
does appear as an invisible beacon, essentially.

740
00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:29.375
LAURA: Yeah, it's a scrying ball.
SAM: How would you know that?

741
00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:30.208
TRAVIS: I don't know!

742
00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:31.833
LAURA: That's okay, if it's going to follow us,

743
00:31:31.833 --> 00:31:33.569
let's all pretend like we're having a party up here

744
00:31:33.569 --> 00:31:35.021
it'll be so confused!
SAM: No, no, no.

745
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:37.321
Not just a party, let's talk about our

746
00:31:37.321 --> 00:31:40.421
(louder) upcoming trip to Rexxentrum!
TRAVIS: Yes!

747
00:31:41.328 --> 00:31:44.699
SAM: Or somewhere else that you guys want to visit.

748
00:31:44.699 --> 00:31:46.488
TALIESIN: Are we going to Rexxentrum?
MARISHA: Who wants a cocktail?

749
00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:48.071
TRAVIS: Hot on the lead--

750
00:31:49.455 --> 00:31:50.697
LIAM: (quietly) Where is it?

751
00:31:50.697 --> 00:31:52.609
TRAVIS: (quietly) It was coming up the stairs.

752
00:31:52.609 --> 00:31:53.832
LIAM: I walk towards the stairs.

753
00:31:53.832 --> 00:31:56.573
SAM: Before you dispel it, we can do things with it.

754
00:31:56.573 --> 00:31:59.537
LAURA: Oh, man!
SAM: Give it false information!

755
00:31:59.537 --> 00:32:00.928
MATT: You walk over to the edge of the stairs,

756
00:32:00.928 --> 00:32:02.255
you guys are all in the little

757
00:32:02.255 --> 00:32:03.526
garden around the tree right now,

758
00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:04.682
is that where you guys have gone?

759
00:32:04.682 --> 00:32:05.890
TALIESIN: I'm going to start making dinner.

760
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.829
SAM: Give it false information first. Don't dispel it yet!

761
00:32:07.829 --> 00:32:10.497
LAURA: I like that you're just shaking a cocktail.

762
00:32:10.497 --> 00:32:12.017
LIAM: Just a slow, ongoing...

763
00:32:12.017 --> 00:32:14.793
SAM: Those fools in Rexxentrum don't know

764
00:32:14.793 --> 00:32:16.450
that we're coming for them.

765
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.580
SAM: We're going to go to Rexxentrum
all right. Right, Caleb?

766
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.767
To Rexxentrum!

767
00:32:20.767 --> 00:32:24.195
MARISHA: And we will find that beacon, just...

768
00:32:24.195 --> 00:32:27.929
TRAVIS: No, that device of great machination.

769
00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:30.630
MARISHA: We need it!
TRAVIS: --that will be a boon--

770
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.635
MARISHA: For the Dynasty!
TRAVIS: For the Empire!

771
00:32:32.635 --> 00:32:34.317
(laughter)

772
00:32:34.317 --> 00:32:35.197
LIAM: Just guesstimating--

773
00:32:35.197 --> 00:32:38.780
MATT: Both of you make deception rolls, please.

774
00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:41.600
Or one of you can make it with advantage,

775
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.668
since you're doing this together.

776
00:32:42.668 --> 00:32:45.414
SAM: Both of you should do it.
LAURA: Yeah, separate.

777
00:32:45.414 --> 00:32:49.198
Because that was horrendous.
LIAM: Guesstimating--

778
00:32:49.198 --> 00:32:52.499
Guesstimating its location--
MARISHA: One, two, three.

779
00:32:52.499 --> 00:32:54.161
LIAM: --to move this into its vicinity.

780
00:32:54.161 --> 00:32:55.636
TRAVIS: 22.
MARISHA: 15.

781
00:32:56.521 --> 00:33:00.521
MATT: Okay, you feel confident that to some folks

782
00:33:00.521 --> 00:33:02.800
you may have been believable in your strange

783
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.617
display of boisterous planning.

784
00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:09.534
TRAVIS: Complete opposite.
(laughter)

785
00:33:11.639 --> 00:33:12.934
LIAM: One of us always lies,

786
00:33:12.934 --> 00:33:14.673
and one of us always tells the truth.

787
00:33:14.673 --> 00:33:16.978
(laughter)

788
00:33:16.978 --> 00:33:18.478
LIAM: Ooh, that's a lie!

789
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.904
MATT: As you finish your statement, you look over

790
00:33:21.904 --> 00:33:23.359
and there's Caleb standing at the front

791
00:33:23.359 --> 00:33:25.309
and you see the orb slowly begin to rise

792
00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:26.899
up to the top of the stairs,

793
00:33:26.899 --> 00:33:30.232
and when it gets within a foot of Caleb,

794
00:33:31.105 --> 00:33:33.337
Caleb holds up a necklace and you watch

795
00:33:33.337 --> 00:33:36.886
(whoosh) blink out.

796
00:33:36.886 --> 00:33:38.426
LIAM: Is is there?

797
00:33:38.426 --> 00:33:41.104
TRAVIS: I don't see it. What are you holding?

798
00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:42.063
LIAM: Is it coming?

799
00:33:42.063 --> 00:33:44.654
TRAVIS: No, it's gone.

800
00:33:44.654 --> 00:33:46.403
What is in your hand?

801
00:33:47.272 --> 00:33:49.494
SAM: He always has that on.

802
00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:51.648
TRAVIS: Perhaps I just wasn't paying attention earlier.

803
00:33:51.648 --> 00:33:52.483
It's gone now.

804
00:33:52.483 --> 00:33:55.355
LAURA: It's so people can't find him.

805
00:33:55.355 --> 00:34:00.024
TRAVIS: Oh, right, you have-- you said!

806
00:34:00.024 --> 00:34:02.674
People cannot look in on you from afar.

807
00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:04.821
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> but it's limited, so.

808
00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:06.417
MARISHA: He's coming back from his amnesia.

809
00:34:06.417 --> 00:34:08.060
TRAVIS: It worked.

810
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.372
TALIESIN: That's impressive.

811
00:34:09.372 --> 00:34:11.898
SAM: It's a slow recovery.
TRAVIS: It worked!

812
00:34:11.898 --> 00:34:14.319
SAM: Oh no!
TRAVIS: I'm so glad for you, Caleb.

813
00:34:14.319 --> 00:34:16.159
Thank god!
LIAM: Punch him in the face!

814
00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.191
LAURA: Cure Wounds at level one on Fjord.

815
00:34:18.191 --> 00:34:20.031
MARISHA: We need a Greater Restoration.

816
00:34:20.031 --> 00:34:22.356
LAURA: Yeah, it's going to take more than a Cure Wounds.

817
00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:24.939
I'm going to aim it right at his brain, though.

818
00:34:24.939 --> 00:34:26.505
Cure Wounds on the inside.

819
00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:28.062
LIAM: You have to reach through and heal Travis.

820
00:34:28.062 --> 00:34:31.079
(laughter)

821
00:34:34.193 --> 00:34:35.611
TRAVIS: I don't see it anymore.

822
00:34:35.611 --> 00:34:37.861
(laughter)

823
00:34:40.242 --> 00:34:41.947
SAM: So someone's watching us.

824
00:34:41.947 --> 00:34:43.323
We can't tell who, though, right?

825
00:34:43.323 --> 00:34:45.449
That's not how scrying works. You can't tell.

826
00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:46.924
LAURA: I mean, no.

827
00:34:48.438 --> 00:34:49.405
MARISHA: Could you--

828
00:34:49.405 --> 00:34:51.878
LAURA: I could scry on somebody and see--

829
00:34:51.878 --> 00:34:55.132
oh no, I can't scry on anybody, I'm out of power.

830
00:34:55.132 --> 00:34:57.639
MARISHA: Is that something your god could tell us?

831
00:34:57.639 --> 00:34:58.655
TALIESIN: Maybe?

832
00:34:58.655 --> 00:35:01.371
LIAM: Do you think there is an above average chance

833
00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:04.087
that it's someone here who knows that we've returned?

834
00:35:04.087 --> 00:35:05.420
LAURA: Hey, Traveler!

835
00:35:06.383 --> 00:35:09.935
Did you see who was looking at us?

836
00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:13.025
Traveler, did you see that funny ball?

837
00:35:13.025 --> 00:35:14.998
TRAVIS: Don't you need to be alone for that, Jester?

838
00:35:14.998 --> 00:35:16.650
LAURA: What? He's always around.

839
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:19.455
TALIESIN: I could find out something about
them if we really wanted.

840
00:35:19.455 --> 00:35:20.762
LAURA: Are you in the tree?

841
00:35:20.762 --> 00:35:23.506
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: How so?

842
00:35:23.506 --> 00:35:28.506
TALIESIN: I could Commune, see if just some general idea.

843
00:35:28.919 --> 00:35:31.433
LAURA: Are you sleeping? You went to bed or something?

844
00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:33.379
MARISHA: I mean, we knew when we got this house

845
00:35:33.379 --> 00:35:37.318
that we were probably being watched the whole time.

846
00:35:37.318 --> 00:35:39.273
TRAVIS: Yes, we did.

847
00:35:39.273 --> 00:35:40.969
TALIESIN: What do we want to bet on? Who do we think it is?

848
00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:43.893
LAURA: Oh man, I wonder how many times they've done that?

849
00:35:43.893 --> 00:35:45.303
TALIESIN: Probably a lot.

850
00:35:45.303 --> 00:35:46.988
MARISHA: And I hope we weren't saying

851
00:35:46.988 --> 00:35:48.756
anything stupid when they did that.

852
00:35:48.756 --> 00:35:53.465
TRAVIS: Us? No! Tight lipped, not a problem.

853
00:35:53.465 --> 00:35:55.823
TALIESIN: When you spend all your time trying

854
00:35:55.823 --> 00:35:58.334
to parse what information to put out,

855
00:35:58.334 --> 00:35:59.981
you're always going to be a little--

856
00:35:59.981 --> 00:36:03.350
LAURA: I wonder who they were scrying on specifically.

857
00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:04.265
SAM: You have to target an individual?

858
00:36:04.265 --> 00:36:06.110
LAURA: You have to target somebody, yes.

859
00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.787
SAM: I like to think it was me.

860
00:36:07.787 --> 00:36:10.377
LAURA: It probably was, Nott.

861
00:36:10.377 --> 00:36:11.341
TALIESIN: Probably was not?

862
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:12.915
MATT: Individual or a location.

863
00:36:12.915 --> 00:36:15.848
LAURA: Or a location.
TALIESIN: Probably it was not Nott.

864
00:36:15.848 --> 00:36:18.343
LAURA: So it could have been our house in general.

865
00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:19.790
TRAVIS: It did seem like it was following us,

866
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.197
and if Caleb is able to prevent that

867
00:36:22.197 --> 00:36:24.197
then that rules him out.

868
00:36:25.176 --> 00:36:28.426
LIAM: I think we need to assume, though, that

869
00:36:29.398 --> 00:36:31.849
it has heard Yussa's name,

870
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:33.940
whoever was looking.

871
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.798
TRAVIS: Yes.
LIAM: And heard us choosing--

872
00:36:35.798 --> 00:36:37.607
LAURA: I mean, maybe, but--

873
00:36:37.607 --> 00:36:40.419
MATT: You do also know, from your experience with Scry,

874
00:36:40.419 --> 00:36:43.008
that it only really picks up information

875
00:36:43.008 --> 00:36:44.625
in the vicinity--

876
00:36:44.625 --> 00:36:46.280
LAURA: In the immediate vicinity of it.

877
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.585
SAM: And it wasn't there when--

878
00:36:47.585 --> 00:36:49.210
LAURA: And you were looking for it, right?

879
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.124
TRAVIS: It appeared later. I think we're safe with Yussa.

880
00:36:52.124 --> 00:36:53.708
MARISHA: After we mentioned Yussa.
TRAVIS: We're okay there.

881
00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:54.956
LAURA: Yeah, so it's fine.

882
00:36:54.956 --> 00:36:58.350
LIAM: Well, that's when you used the ability.

883
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.462
LAURA: No, but he'd been using it for like an hour.

884
00:37:00.462 --> 00:37:02.357
TRAVIS: But I ran upstairs
MARISHA: Yes, he used it upstairs.

885
00:37:02.357 --> 00:37:04.276
LIAM: It was running upstairs?
MARISHA: Yes.

886
00:37:04.276 --> 00:37:06.069
LAURA: Yeah, so it wasn't with us for a while.

887
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:07.802
LIAM: Stupid invisible set.

888
00:37:07.802 --> 00:37:10.580
TRAVIS: All right, so let's pretend someone was watching,

889
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.427
we should--
SAM: Does that change anything?

890
00:37:12.427 --> 00:37:15.452
Are we still going to report to Essek in the morning?

891
00:37:15.452 --> 00:37:18.051
TRAVIS: We should.
LAURA: Yeah, I think we should.

892
00:37:18.051 --> 00:37:20.321
LIAM: Are you able to do your suggestion, Caduceus?

893
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:23.136
TALIESIN: I would ask what three questions?

894
00:37:23.136 --> 00:37:26.730
LIAM: You would ask, is it from someone here?

895
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:29.834
If that is yes, we start naming names.

896
00:37:29.834 --> 00:37:31.530
TALIESIN: Someone in the Dynasty.

897
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.176
MARISHA: Someone we know.
LIAM: Dynasty.

898
00:37:33.176 --> 00:37:34.359
And then two names.

899
00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:35.736
TALIESIN: All right, what are our two names?

900
00:37:35.736 --> 00:37:36.791
SAM and LAURA: Essek!

901
00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:38.446
TRAVIS and MARISHA: The Bright Queen!

902
00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:41.507
TRAVIS: Or is it the--
LAURA: The old lady goblin!

903
00:37:41.507 --> 00:37:42.424
TRAVIS: What's her name?

904
00:37:42.424 --> 00:37:44.592
SAM: I will look it up in my memory.

905
00:37:44.592 --> 00:37:47.017
TRAVIS: Yeah, go ahead.
TALIESIN: Give me a piece of paper.

906
00:37:47.017 --> 00:37:48.899
TRAVIS: Kevin Spacey Se7en notes.

907
00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:50.176
LAURA: I'm going to look in my notes, too.

908
00:37:50.176 --> 00:37:51.374
I bet I can find it faster!

909
00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:54.291
TALIESIN: In the meantime, I need some tea.

910
00:37:55.357 --> 00:37:58.591
SAM: Leylas Kryn, Mirimm, Kryn, Thelyss.

911
00:37:58.591 --> 00:38:00.122
LAURA: Miriam?

912
00:38:00.122 --> 00:38:05.122
SAM: Skysybil Abrianna, the female goblin, Den Mirimm.

913
00:38:05.574 --> 00:38:07.406
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: I love all of this.

914
00:38:07.406 --> 00:38:09.596
So Essek and the Bright Queen are immediate.

915
00:38:09.596 --> 00:38:12.201
LAURA: Hey, Skysybil, old lady goblin!

916
00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:14.851
SAM: Yeah!
LAURA: Den Miriam.

917
00:38:14.851 --> 00:38:15.979
I wrote it down.

918
00:38:15.979 --> 00:38:17.605
MATT: You did, I'm proud of you.

919
00:38:17.605 --> 00:38:20.272
TALIESIN: Essek, Skysybil, Bright Queen?

920
00:38:22.431 --> 00:38:26.114
So, is it someone in the Dynasty?

921
00:38:27.381 --> 00:38:29.247
LAURA: Hey, wait!

922
00:38:29.247 --> 00:38:31.467
Whatever happened to Lythir VaSuun?

923
00:38:31.467 --> 00:38:34.254
The guy we fought that turned us in.

924
00:38:34.254 --> 00:38:36.709
Did we ever look him up again?

925
00:38:36.709 --> 00:38:37.592
SAM: Oh, that's right.

926
00:38:37.592 --> 00:38:39.171
LAURA: He knew what we were and we

927
00:38:39.171 --> 00:38:41.856
talked him out of believing it, right?

928
00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:44.138
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down
LAURA: I wonder if he hates us.

929
00:38:44.138 --> 00:38:46.348
TALIESIN: Start burning a little incense, drinking my tea

930
00:38:46.348 --> 00:38:48.765
incense and getting together.

931
00:38:51.542 --> 00:38:55.131
MATT: You're aware of this at this point.

932
00:38:55.131 --> 00:38:57.255
Though the sun doesn't necessarily rise or fall here

933
00:38:57.255 --> 00:39:01.614
in the center of Rosohna, it is about dawn.

934
00:39:01.614 --> 00:39:03.484
LIAM: Oh, so we are exhausted.

935
00:39:03.484 --> 00:39:05.114
MATT: You're pretty tired, just as a heads up.

936
00:39:05.114 --> 00:39:06.286
LAURA: We need to go to sleep.

937
00:39:06.286 --> 00:39:09.607
LIAM: Well, this is good to do now before we crash.

938
00:39:09.607 --> 00:39:10.880
TALIESIN: This is the end of me.

939
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.655
MATT: So while you guys are looking at the space

940
00:39:13.655 --> 00:39:17.961
and Dairon returns from gathering what small supplies

941
00:39:17.961 --> 00:39:20.696
that she has packed up in a satchel,

942
00:39:20.696 --> 00:39:23.449
you finish completing your ritual

943
00:39:23.449 --> 00:39:27.139
in the center of the tower-top of the Xhorhouse,

944
00:39:27.139 --> 00:39:29.155
underneath the tree that you built

945
00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:31.800
in the Wildmother's honor.

946
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.240
After the incense burns and you inhale it into your

947
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:39.749
nose and it tingles and sears the inside,

948
00:39:39.749 --> 00:39:43.383
your eyes water slightly, and with your eyes closed

949
00:39:43.383 --> 00:39:46.188
you can feel that warm breeze pass through your mind

950
00:39:46.188 --> 00:39:49.605
and over your arms and shoulders as well.

951
00:39:52.413 --> 00:39:54.830
TALIESIN: We were just being watched.

952
00:39:56.497 --> 00:40:01.322
Was it by someone who is a member of the Dynasty?

953
00:40:02.787 --> 00:40:06.654
MATT: The breeze comes by once more,

954
00:40:06.654 --> 00:40:09.112
this time warm and affirming.

955
00:40:09.112 --> 00:40:12.001
(wind whooshes)

956
00:40:12.001 --> 00:40:13.553
You also feel the breeze, too.

957
00:40:13.553 --> 00:40:16.236
(gasps)
LAURA: Ooh!

958
00:40:16.236 --> 00:40:18.448
You guys are so in sync.

959
00:40:18.448 --> 00:40:21.932
MATT: You actually watch as both Caduceus' and

960
00:40:21.932 --> 00:40:24.616
Fjord's hair slightly shift to an invisible wind

961
00:40:24.616 --> 00:40:28.095
that doesn't exist.
LAURA: Ooh, an invisible tusk.

962
00:40:28.095 --> 00:40:29.903
TALIESIN: Was it Essek?

963
00:40:32.676 --> 00:40:35.909
MATT: The wind grows cold.

964
00:40:39.286 --> 00:40:41.251
TALIESIN: That's good.

965
00:40:41.251 --> 00:40:43.193
MARISHA: Is Essek part of Den Thelyss?

966
00:40:43.193 --> 00:40:45.484
SAM: Wait, did we already ask-- was it the Dynasty?

967
00:40:45.484 --> 00:40:46.343
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

968
00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:47.623
LAURA: So we're asking about people in the Dynasty.

969
00:40:47.623 --> 00:40:50.121
TALIESIN: I actually am going to
try something slightly different,

970
00:40:50.121 --> 00:40:53.881
because I think it's just too hit and miss.

971
00:40:53.881 --> 00:40:56.131
Does the Bright Queen know?

972
00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:06.355
MATT: You get the sense
you may need to clarify your question.

973
00:41:06.355 --> 00:41:08.838
TALIESIN: Does the Bright Queen--

974
00:41:08.838 --> 00:41:10.354
Does the Bright Queen--

975
00:41:10.354 --> 00:41:12.003
LAURA: (gasps)

976
00:41:12.003 --> 00:41:16.145
TALIESIN: Has she asked that we be watched?
Is this by her command?

977
00:41:16.145 --> 00:41:19.745
MATT: The breeze once more becomes warm.

978
00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:21.544
LAURA: She doesn't trust us.

979
00:41:21.544 --> 00:41:24.188
SAM: I wouldn't either.
TRAVIS: We're from out of town.

980
00:41:24.188 --> 00:41:26.438
LAURA: Yeah, I know.
TALIESIN: I wouldn't trust us.

981
00:41:26.438 --> 00:41:28.021
Thank you.
TRAVIS: Our visas are limited.

982
00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:30.487
LAURA: That's it, that's all we get?

983
00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:31.758
TALIESIN: That's all we get.

984
00:41:31.758 --> 00:41:32.628
LAURA: Man, if she was like the Traveler,

985
00:41:32.628 --> 00:41:35.444
you could sit down and have a whole conversation
with her right now.

986
00:41:35.444 --> 00:41:37.565
SAM: Let's not compare gods, all right?

987
00:41:37.565 --> 00:41:39.298
TRAVIS: That's amazing, Caduceus, every time.

988
00:41:39.298 --> 00:41:41.056
It's very impressive.

989
00:41:41.056 --> 00:41:42.651
TALIESIN: You were there, too.
TRAVIS: I was.

990
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:44.562
SAM: The Traveler sounds pretty cool.

991
00:41:44.562 --> 00:41:45.828
TALIESIN: We should have a talk about that at some point.

992
00:41:45.828 --> 00:41:47.811
SAM: I mean, a breeze, come on.

993
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:50.781
LAURA: Like, he'd be like, "Dude, yeah, it's the Dynasty."

994
00:41:50.781 --> 00:41:52.562
SAM: "Oh, I'm talking in wind!"

995
00:41:52.562 --> 00:41:54.906
LIAM: We are really spinning our wheels here,

996
00:41:54.906 --> 00:41:58.080
I think we maybe we should--
TRAVIS: Crash, yeah.

997
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.324
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a hot tub and then go to sleep.

998
00:42:01.324 --> 00:42:05.299
MATT: Dairon goes, "Just out of curiosity,

999
00:42:06.295 --> 00:42:10.128
"where are you going and can you bring another?"

1000
00:42:11.077 --> 00:42:12.577
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1001
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.664
We're talking about--
SAM: Is it okay to say out loud?

1002
00:42:15.664 --> 00:42:19.540
MARISHA: I don't say it out loud, I write it down in my book

1003
00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.290
and I show it to her.

1004
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:22.609
MATT: Which is--? What'd you write down?

1005
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:23.786
MARISHA: Nicodranas.

1006
00:42:23.786 --> 00:42:26.277
MATT: Okay, and she nods.

1007
00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:28.492
"Close enough, it's better

1008
00:42:28.492 --> 00:42:32.409
"than taking the long way by foot, so thank you."

1009
00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:37.132
LIAM: I'm going to start putting up the dome

1010
00:42:37.132 --> 00:42:40.380
in our study-laboratory.
LAURA: Oh, that's smart.

1011
00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.997
Yeah, let's sleep in there tonight.

1012
00:42:42.997 --> 00:42:47.625
MARISHA: I pull Dairon aside for a second.

1013
00:42:47.625 --> 00:42:50.000
MATT: Okay. As you guys are getting that

1014
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.846
all set up for the evening's rest,

1015
00:42:51.846 --> 00:42:55.627
Dairon meets with you off to the side.

1016
00:42:55.627 --> 00:42:57.759
MARISHA: Can I have my seal back?

1017
00:42:58.817 --> 00:43:01.766
MATT: "Yes, you may, It has come in very handy

1018
00:43:01.766 --> 00:43:04.155
"getting me to the places I needed to go."

1019
00:43:04.155 --> 00:43:06.300
MARISHA: Remember.
MATT: "There you are."

1020
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.387
MARISHA: That stays between us.

1021
00:43:08.387 --> 00:43:10.096
MATT: "Of course.

1022
00:43:10.096 --> 00:43:11.546
"Beauregard..."

1023
00:43:14.214 --> 00:43:15.530
MARISHA: What?

1024
00:43:17.738 --> 00:43:19.655
MATT: And she turns around.

1025
00:43:20.683 --> 00:43:22.185
MARISHA: Where's she going?

1026
00:43:22.185 --> 00:43:24.725
(laughter)

1027
00:43:24.725 --> 00:43:26.806
MATT: She's leaving.

1028
00:43:26.806 --> 00:43:29.494
You know that look because she's given you that look

1029
00:43:29.494 --> 00:43:31.277
every time you guys parted

1030
00:43:31.277 --> 00:43:32.903
but didn't feel the need to say the words--

1031
00:43:32.903 --> 00:43:34.467
MATT and MARISHA: "Don't die."

1032
00:43:34.467 --> 00:43:35.300
MARISHA: Okay.

1033
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.705
Any more pieces of training,

1034
00:43:39.705 --> 00:43:43.455
since you know, we trained for all this shit?

1035
00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:52.634
MATT: "Some way to keep it quiet..."

1036
00:43:53.642 --> 00:43:57.001
And she calls you down to the cellar, the basement area.

1037
00:43:57.001 --> 00:44:00.001
(footsteps tapping)

1038
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.697
MATT: Puts fingers to the front, saying--

1039
00:44:06.098 --> 00:44:11.098
Begins to quietly work you through a series of forms.

1040
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:17.138
The beginning process of showing you how to react

1041
00:44:17.138 --> 00:44:20.426
to an assault or to react to a movement

1042
00:44:20.426 --> 00:44:23.255
and then briefly pulse the adrenaline

1043
00:44:23.255 --> 00:44:26.397
in your body through the expense of ki

1044
00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:29.049
to have twice the reaction or even more

1045
00:44:29.049 --> 00:44:31.299
depending on the situation.

1046
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.619
It's an exhausting bit, especially after

1047
00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:37.127
an exhausting day, and as such, the training is incomplete.

1048
00:44:37.127 --> 00:44:39.993
But the beginnings of your next stage

1049
00:44:39.993 --> 00:44:43.160
as a Cobalt Soul Expositor have begun.

1050
00:44:44.508 --> 00:44:46.330
MARISHA: Cool, I go to bed.

1051
00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:47.185
TRAVIS: Dope.

1052
00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:50.129
LAURA: I'm going to go into Yasha's room.

1053
00:44:50.129 --> 00:44:51.645
MATT: Okay.

1054
00:44:51.645 --> 00:44:53.395
SAM: She's there.
LAURA: Yeah!

1055
00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:56.451
I'm going to look at the mural,

1056
00:44:56.451 --> 00:45:00.401
and I'm going to sit down on Yasha's bed and

1057
00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.699
I'm just going to say,

1058
00:45:06.863 --> 00:45:08.188
Oh, Traveler.

1059
00:45:10.145 --> 00:45:15.061
Probably saw that we kind of shit the bed a little bit.

1060
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.001
And I know you have a lot going on with TravelerCon

1061
00:45:22.001 --> 00:45:25.232
coming up, I know that you're probably pretty busy,

1062
00:45:25.232 --> 00:45:30.207
but our friend Yasha's in a bit of a pickle right now,

1063
00:45:30.207 --> 00:45:33.415
and she's having a hard time

1064
00:45:34.285 --> 00:45:36.397
and she's working with some really bad people

1065
00:45:36.397 --> 00:45:38.684
but I know it's not by choice, okay,

1066
00:45:38.684 --> 00:45:42.321
because I scryed on her with your help and you saw too,

1067
00:45:42.321 --> 00:45:45.223
she's trying to fight it.

1068
00:45:45.223 --> 00:45:49.994
And I know that she works with the Stormlord and stuff, but

1069
00:45:49.994 --> 00:45:53.535
if you can just try to

1070
00:45:53.535 --> 00:45:56.410
keep an eye out on her as well

1071
00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:58.790
and maybe help her fight it a little bit,

1072
00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.636
because I'm having a hard time knowing that

1073
00:46:00.636 --> 00:46:02.728
we abandoned her, okay?

1074
00:46:04.596 --> 00:46:07.096
(heavy sighs)

1075
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.513
MATT: In the silence, as you sit there and

1076
00:46:14.036 --> 00:46:16.732
quietly mourn the frustrating circumstances

1077
00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:19.534
surrounding your friend,

1078
00:46:19.534 --> 00:46:23.234
you look up at the flower wall that you painted her,

1079
00:46:24.775 --> 00:46:27.937
and you swear, right there in the middle of the flowers,

1080
00:46:27.937 --> 00:46:29.517
the beautiful shapes and curls,

1081
00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:32.684
you see what looks like a hidden dick.

1082
00:46:34.943 --> 00:46:37.110
LAURA: I didn't paint that one.

1083
00:46:41.642 --> 00:46:42.475
Okay.

1084
00:46:44.382 --> 00:46:46.448
I'm going to go get in the study,

1085
00:46:46.448 --> 00:46:48.254
after I wipe my face off.

1086
00:46:48.254 --> 00:46:49.087
MATT: Okay.

1087
00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:55.314
The rest of you gather around Caleb and his hut,

1088
00:46:55.314 --> 00:46:59.635
bed down, even within the comfort of your own house,

1089
00:46:59.635 --> 00:47:03.385
carefully and defensively for a night's rest.

1090
00:47:04.347 --> 00:47:05.915
You all can take your long rest.

1091
00:47:05.915 --> 00:47:07.900
(cheering)

1092
00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:12.900
TRAVIS: Touch that button, boom, yes, confirm!

1093
00:47:13.699 --> 00:47:15.694
Holy shit.
SAM: Confirm!

1094
00:47:15.694 --> 00:47:18.512
LAURA: Now we choose the spells, spells, spells!

1095
00:47:18.512 --> 00:47:21.764
TALIESIN: Oh, they're all back!
LAURA: Pick your spells!

1096
00:47:21.764 --> 00:47:23.417
SAM: Pick your spells for travel, pick your spells

1097
00:47:23.417 --> 00:47:26.334
for talking to Essek. Come on, guys.

1098
00:47:27.308 --> 00:47:30.162
No controlling water, guys, come on.

1099
00:47:30.162 --> 00:47:33.037
TRAVIS: But, it's innate, it's innate.

1100
00:47:33.897 --> 00:47:35.757
TALIESIN: I wanted to use Meld Into Stone.

1101
00:47:35.757 --> 00:47:37.511
(laughter)

1102
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:39.022
TRAVIS: Melt into Stone?

1103
00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:41.359
TALIESIN: Meld Into Stone.

1104
00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:43.308
MARISHA: Meld.
SAM: That's a thing?

1105
00:47:43.308 --> 00:47:45.749
TRAVIS: "It's bad, run!"

1106
00:47:45.749 --> 00:47:47.749
No, "We're running, it's bad!"

1107
00:47:47.749 --> 00:47:50.599
TALIESIN: It's pretty cool.

1108
00:47:50.599 --> 00:47:55.141
MATT: So you wake up rested,

1109
00:47:55.141 --> 00:47:57.090
safe within the final moments

1110
00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.524
of the hut fading (whooshing)

1111
00:47:59.524 --> 00:48:02.034
before the cover vanishes and you all find yourselves

1112
00:48:02.034 --> 00:48:05.044
standing in the center of the arcane study

1113
00:48:05.044 --> 00:48:08.534
with the day, past noon at this point,

1114
00:48:08.534 --> 00:48:11.351
a few hours into the afternoon, at your disposal.

1115
00:48:11.351 --> 00:48:13.179
What would you like to do?

1116
00:48:13.179 --> 00:48:15.184
SAM: Let's call Essek in, I suppose?

1117
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:17.651
Also, by the way, just rewinding a bit

1118
00:48:17.651 --> 00:48:20.361
to our fight with Obann and stuff,

1119
00:48:20.361 --> 00:48:22.170
next time we fight Obann,

1120
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.443
let's have one of the Counterspell people closer,

1121
00:48:25.443 --> 00:48:28.201
so that he can't get away,

1122
00:48:28.201 --> 00:48:30.835
and also maybe the whip? The whip?

1123
00:48:30.835 --> 00:48:32.519
We could hold him there with the whip?

1124
00:48:32.519 --> 00:48:33.842
That's a thing, right?

1125
00:48:33.842 --> 00:48:36.606
TRAVIS: I think he could still teleport away--

1126
00:48:36.606 --> 00:48:38.103
SAM: I guess you're right.

1127
00:48:38.103 --> 00:48:39.347
TRAVIS: I don't know what would happen after that,

1128
00:48:39.347 --> 00:48:41.997
take half the whip, take me, I don't know.

1129
00:48:41.997 --> 00:48:43.327
SAM: Either way, we win!

1130
00:48:43.327 --> 00:48:45.701
TRAVIS: All right.
(laughter)

1131
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:47.467
LIAM: I will also need to do a little bit of shopping

1132
00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:49.931
if we hope to go to Nicodranas today.

1133
00:48:49.931 --> 00:48:52.323
SAM: Oh, you need some chalk or something?

1134
00:48:52.323 --> 00:48:53.573
LIAM: I could just run out quickly now.

1135
00:48:53.573 --> 00:48:55.560
TRAVIS: Sure.
LIAM: While we wait.

1136
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.656
Send word to Essek.
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

1137
00:48:57.656 --> 00:48:59.466
LIAM: I will go to--
MARISHA: What are we saying to Essek?

1138
00:48:59.466 --> 00:49:00.515
Sorry, go ahead.

1139
00:49:00.515 --> 00:49:03.439
TALIESIN: We may have to go to Essek, if we have to.

1140
00:49:03.439 --> 00:49:05.443
LIAM: I don't think we know where he lives, still.

1141
00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:07.111
TALIESIN: True.
LAURA: He's never told us.

1142
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:08.586
LIAM: Before the day gets on, I will just run off

1143
00:49:08.586 --> 00:49:10.851
to the same place that I've been to before

1144
00:49:10.851 --> 00:49:14.940
and spend-- how much money do I have?

1145
00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.449
TRAVIS: Two, three...
TALIESIN: Need to borrow a little?

1146
00:49:16.449 --> 00:49:17.574
LIAM: No, no, I'm all right.

1147
00:49:17.574 --> 00:49:20.823
SAM: And me and Fjord will also send--

1148
00:49:20.823 --> 00:49:23.056
TRAVIS: <i>Fjord and I</i>!

1149
00:49:23.056 --> 00:49:26.001
SAM: Will also send some requests.

1150
00:49:26.001 --> 00:49:29.812
I would like a drop of bitumen and a spider.

1151
00:49:29.812 --> 00:49:32.515
I would also like a bit of fleece,

1152
00:49:32.515 --> 00:49:35.532
get me an eyelash encased in gum arabic,

1153
00:49:35.532 --> 00:49:38.107
I'd like some tiny tarts and a feather.

1154
00:49:38.107 --> 00:49:39.147
LIAM: Oh, well role-played.

1155
00:49:39.147 --> 00:49:41.175
SAM: And another bit of fleece,

1156
00:49:41.175 --> 00:49:44.983
lot of fucking fleece spells.
LAURA: You don't have like a--

1157
00:49:44.983 --> 00:49:47.611
Maybe just get a components bag.

1158
00:49:47.611 --> 00:49:49.404
SAM: Yeah, whatever, I don't want to do--

1159
00:49:49.404 --> 00:49:51.765
I don't want to be what Fjord did last time.

1160
00:49:51.765 --> 00:49:54.021
Get me all the components for everything!

1161
00:49:54.021 --> 00:49:55.476
MATT: Which as a note, too, clarifying on that

1162
00:49:55.476 --> 00:49:57.490
because I looked it up extensively afterward,

1163
00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.790
you do not need the blood to

1164
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:02.721
summon the demon. You need the blood if you want to

1165
00:50:02.721 --> 00:50:05.934
draw the circle that's the second half of the spell.

1166
00:50:05.934 --> 00:50:07.833
TRAVIS: Got it.
MATT: Another circumstance of

1167
00:50:07.833 --> 00:50:10.049
the internet yelling at me
for doing rules incorrectly,

1168
00:50:10.049 --> 00:50:11.041
getting confused by the rules,

1169
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:13.610
and then realizing I did it right accidentally,

1170
00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:16.067
and the internet was the internet.

1171
00:50:16.067 --> 00:50:18.893
But thank you for all the clarification after the fact, too.

1172
00:50:18.893 --> 00:50:20.223
SAM: Guys, we love the internet.

1173
00:50:20.223 --> 00:50:22.569
MATT: We love it.
(laughter)

1174
00:50:22.569 --> 00:50:24.866
MATT: Yeah, shopping can-- oh, sorry.

1175
00:50:24.866 --> 00:50:26.195
LIAM: Give me some money.

1176
00:50:26.195 --> 00:50:27.575
SAM: Sure, how much do you need?

1177
00:50:27.575 --> 00:50:29.204
LIAM: Well, I am good for the chalks

1178
00:50:29.204 --> 00:50:30.629
that I will need for us to travel,

1179
00:50:30.629 --> 00:50:33.108
but if you want to get some stuff, give me--

1180
00:50:33.108 --> 00:50:35.492
I don't know, give me 50 gold and I'll give you the change.

1181
00:50:35.492 --> 00:50:39.276
SAM: I'll give you 75, you handsome young wizard.

1182
00:50:39.276 --> 00:50:40.184
TRAVIS: Jesus.

1183
00:50:40.184 --> 00:50:44.243
(laughter)

1184
00:50:44.243 --> 00:50:45.709
SAM: Keep the change.

1185
00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:48.502
TRAVIS: Are you blushing?
LIAM: Wow.

1186
00:50:48.502 --> 00:50:49.335
Yes.

1187
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.427
All right, I go shopping.

1188
00:50:52.427 --> 00:50:53.260
MATT: Okay.

1189
00:50:54.571 --> 00:50:55.681
Prices are a bit high,

1190
00:50:55.681 --> 00:50:57.308
and things are a little scarce right now.

1191
00:50:57.308 --> 00:50:59.336
The war effort has been placing a lot of supplies

1192
00:50:59.336 --> 00:51:03.242
out of Rosohna and closer to Asarius and

1193
00:51:03.242 --> 00:51:05.847
the Western front of Xhorhas, so as such,

1194
00:51:05.847 --> 00:51:07.148
the component pouch, which would normally cost

1195
00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:10.285
about 25 gold goes for 40 to get all the supplies

1196
00:51:10.285 --> 00:51:12.363
that are needed and requested by Nott.

1197
00:51:12.363 --> 00:51:13.693
LIAM: Is the chalk pricier as well?

1198
00:51:13.693 --> 00:51:16.020
MATT: The chalk is an additional 20 gold
beyond its normal price.

1199
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.604
MARISHA: Dang!
TRAVIS: Fuck.

1200
00:51:17.604 --> 00:51:20.989
LIAM: You gave me 75, all right, I have enough for that.

1201
00:51:20.989 --> 00:51:22.930
How much higher than regular?

1202
00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:24.819
MATT: Sorry, how much chalk are you purchasing?

1203
00:51:24.819 --> 00:51:27.171
LIAM: Three doses, so that's 150 gold's worth,

1204
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:28.950
as written in the spell.
MATT: Correct.

1205
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.281
An additional 20 on top of that, so 170.

1206
00:51:31.281 --> 00:51:32.114
LIAM: Overall.
MATT: Yes.

1207
00:51:32.114 --> 00:51:33.269
LIAM: Okay, okay.

1208
00:51:33.269 --> 00:51:34.419
MARISHA: Where are we, in Manhattan?

1209
00:51:34.419 --> 00:51:36.815
LIAM: Yeah, I have it, okay.

1210
00:51:36.815 --> 00:51:39.208
TRAVIS: For a bottle of water at a Hilton, what is this?

1211
00:51:39.208 --> 00:51:41.458
(laughter)

1212
00:51:44.737 --> 00:51:47.312
MARISHA: Is this a Coke on a Eurostar, what is this?

1213
00:51:47.312 --> 00:51:49.562
(laughter)

1214
00:51:53.212 --> 00:51:54.412
LIAM: Okay.

1215
00:51:56.298 --> 00:51:59.184
All right, I hustle back, once I have

1216
00:51:59.184 --> 00:52:01.968
a tote full of potpourri and other bits,

1217
00:52:01.968 --> 00:52:04.026
I hand it over to Nott.
SAM: Thank you

1218
00:52:04.026 --> 00:52:05.486
for these bits and pieces.

1219
00:52:05.486 --> 00:52:08.070
Did we already summon Essek and how do we do so?

1220
00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:10.458
LAURA: Oh yes, while they were gone,
I sent a message to Essek.

1221
00:52:10.458 --> 00:52:11.913
SAM: Great.
MATT: Okay.

1222
00:52:11.913 --> 00:52:14.131
LAURA: Hold on, I got to make sure I have that prepared.

1223
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:15.818
SAM: Just say a message.

1224
00:52:15.818 --> 00:52:18.394
LAURA: Essek, we're back, but we really need to talk to you

1225
00:52:18.394 --> 00:52:20.144
if you have the time.

1226
00:52:21.078 --> 00:52:23.495
Because it's super important.

1227
00:52:24.427 --> 00:52:26.312
Also--
SAM: Uh-oh.

1228
00:52:26.312 --> 00:52:30.595
LAURA: You're super cool, we miss you, <i>and</i>

1229
00:52:32.676 --> 00:52:34.843
♪ you float really good! ♪

1230
00:52:34.843 --> 00:52:38.060
(laughter)

1231
00:52:41.682 --> 00:52:44.584
MATT: As a reminder, you don't <i>have</i> to say all the words,

1232
00:52:44.584 --> 00:52:46.450
but I appreciate the effort.

1233
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:48.695
(laughter)

1234
00:52:48.695 --> 00:52:51.149
MATT: I respect that.
SAM: You want to use it all up!

1235
00:52:51.149 --> 00:52:53.988
LAURA: Exactly.
LIAM: Those words wasted!

1236
00:52:53.988 --> 00:52:56.858
MATT: Every piece of the buffalo, I respect that.

1237
00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:01.497
MATT: Essek responds, "Ah, this is good to hear.

1238
00:53:01.497 --> 00:53:04.761
"I'm glad you returned, I assume safely.

1239
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:08.037
"I will go ahead and pass on by within the hour."

1240
00:53:09.237 --> 00:53:10.519
LAURA: He's coming by.

1241
00:53:10.519 --> 00:53:12.102
SAM: Excellent.
LAURA: Yeah.

1242
00:53:14.159 --> 00:53:17.942
TRAVIS: While I'm waiting for Caleb to return,

1243
00:53:17.942 --> 00:53:21.300
can I go ahead and ju-u-ust use

1244
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.516
that same feature

1245
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:29.236
I used last night and cast See Invisibility

1246
00:53:29.236 --> 00:53:31.533
for another hour?
MATT: Okay.

1247
00:53:31.533 --> 00:53:33.638
And you just...?

1248
00:53:33.638 --> 00:53:35.551
TRAVIS: Just in the room, I'll try and stay around

1249
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:39.267
everyone else just to see if there are any more spheres.

1250
00:53:39.267 --> 00:53:40.100
MATT: Okay.

1251
00:53:42.117 --> 00:53:46.783
About half an hour into waiting for Essek's arrival,

1252
00:53:48.075 --> 00:53:51.792
same type of little sentry orb

1253
00:53:51.792 --> 00:53:54.099
just floats back down the stairs.

1254
00:53:54.099 --> 00:53:55.531
LAURA: Just hanging out this whole damn time.

1255
00:53:55.531 --> 00:53:57.694
MARISHA: It totally fucking has.

1256
00:53:57.694 --> 00:53:59.844
TRAVIS: You know, I really didn't think that the Dynasty

1257
00:53:59.844 --> 00:54:01.995
would have such a bug problem,

1258
00:54:01.995 --> 00:54:05.420
but it is really prevalent right now.

1259
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.993
MARISHA: Hmm.
SAM: All right.

1260
00:54:06.993 --> 00:54:09.184
LAURA: What kind of bugs?

1261
00:54:09.184 --> 00:54:12.628
TRAVIS: Like, you know, ones with--
SAM: Big eyes.

1262
00:54:12.628 --> 00:54:15.737
TRAVIS: Yes, many, many eyes.

1263
00:54:15.737 --> 00:54:17.475
LAURA: Ooh, like spiders?

1264
00:54:17.475 --> 00:54:20.890
TRAVIS: (squeaks) Sure, they have lots of eyes. Very--

1265
00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:21.856
LAURA: Or flies have lot of--

1266
00:54:21.856 --> 00:54:23.814
well, they've got big eyes at least.

1267
00:54:23.814 --> 00:54:24.872
TRAVIS: Right, perhaps, like

1268
00:54:24.872 --> 00:54:27.181
one big eye on the--
MATT: (knocking)

1269
00:54:27.181 --> 00:54:28.464
SAM: Front door!

1270
00:54:28.464 --> 00:54:29.848
LAURA: I'll go--

1271
00:54:29.848 --> 00:54:31.380
SAM: Let someone else get the door.

1272
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.627
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Hey!

1273
00:54:32.627 --> 00:54:35.088
How does scrying work, can they see and hear?

1274
00:54:35.088 --> 00:54:36.001
LAURA: Yeah.

1275
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:37.954
MATT: You go to-- the door opens slightly,

1276
00:54:37.954 --> 00:54:40.858
the chimes ding ding a little bit.

1277
00:54:40.858 --> 00:54:45.678
On the other side, you see Essek with two of the guards

1278
00:54:45.678 --> 00:54:47.805
of the Rosohna guard at his side.

1279
00:54:47.805 --> 00:54:49.664
"Hello--"

1280
00:54:49.664 --> 00:54:51.099
MARISHA: Wait, he's got two guards?
MATT: Yes.

1281
00:54:51.099 --> 00:54:52.415
MARISHA: Why's he got two guards?

1282
00:54:52.415 --> 00:54:54.915
Wait, what? Sorry, keep going.

1283
00:54:55.874 --> 00:54:58.662
MATT: "I apologize for the

1284
00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:03.288
"companions, there was apparently a break-in last night

1285
00:55:03.288 --> 00:55:06.796
"into some records and as such,

1286
00:55:06.796 --> 00:55:08.737
"we're just being more careful."

1287
00:55:08.737 --> 00:55:12.110
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
MATT: "So, anyway.

1288
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:15.002
"Wait outside, if you don't mind."
The two guards stay exterior--

1289
00:55:15.002 --> 00:55:16.968
MARISHA: Dairon's not in the room with us, right?

1290
00:55:16.968 --> 00:55:19.004
MATT: Dairon is nowhere to be seen currently.
MARISHA: Okay.

1291
00:55:19.004 --> 00:55:20.897
LIAM: We haven't seen them all morning?

1292
00:55:20.897 --> 00:55:21.730
MATT: No.
LIAM: Okay.

1293
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.036
MARISHA: I would have told them that we were doing this

1294
00:55:24.036 --> 00:55:26.701
and to not come and, like, hide.

1295
00:55:26.701 --> 00:55:28.629
MATT: Dairon, you have not seen at all this morning.

1296
00:55:28.629 --> 00:55:29.962
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: At all.

1297
00:55:31.827 --> 00:55:33.423
Essek enters the chamber--

1298
00:55:33.423 --> 00:55:37.343
SAM: She's not going to come out of the shower or something?

1299
00:55:37.343 --> 00:55:40.705
MATT: "So, I see you have all arrived safely.

1300
00:55:40.705 --> 00:55:42.771
"How did the venture go?"

1301
00:55:42.771 --> 00:55:43.759
TALIESIN: Not well.

1302
00:55:43.759 --> 00:55:46.934
LAURA: It went real, real bad, Essek.

1303
00:55:46.934 --> 00:55:48.885
MATT: "I am sorry to hear that."

1304
00:55:48.885 --> 00:55:50.227
LAURA: So are we.

1305
00:55:50.227 --> 00:55:53.520
TRAVIS: Unsuccessful again, we seem to be in a

1306
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.183
never-ending chase after that which

1307
00:55:55.183 --> 00:55:57.558
we are trying to prevent.

1308
00:55:57.558 --> 00:56:01.059
MARISHA: Which means Obann is one step closer
to his overall goal

1309
00:56:01.059 --> 00:56:05.259
and potentially not on this plane with us anymore.

1310
00:56:05.259 --> 00:56:09.576
MATT: "I think, given the circumstances, and how--

1311
00:56:09.576 --> 00:56:11.334
"how dire this growth seems to be

1312
00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:14.228
"of this individual you've been after,

1313
00:56:14.228 --> 00:56:18.811
"perhaps we put our specific endeavor

1314
00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:22.621
"on hold while you pursue this one, yes?"

1315
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:25.449
SAM: Pursue... Obann?

1316
00:56:25.449 --> 00:56:26.628
LAURA: Here's the thing, I think

1317
00:56:26.628 --> 00:56:29.764
we're a little bit out of our depth.

1318
00:56:29.764 --> 00:56:33.866
He's pretty powerful and he just woke up somebody else.

1319
00:56:33.866 --> 00:56:36.416
The Inevitable End.

1320
00:56:39.264 --> 00:56:41.952
MATT: "All right, I will put some research into this.

1321
00:56:41.952 --> 00:56:44.706
"I already have a few operatives

1322
00:56:44.706 --> 00:56:48.205
"looking to infiltrate-- to locate and infiltrate

1323
00:56:48.205 --> 00:56:51.472
"the Cult of the Angel of Irons, you said it was,

1324
00:56:51.472 --> 00:56:53.069
"in hopes of gathering more information."

1325
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:54.279
LAURA: You have?

1326
00:56:54.279 --> 00:56:56.504
MATT: "Yes, since you gave me
this information a while back."

1327
00:56:56.504 --> 00:56:57.337
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1328
00:56:57.337 --> 00:56:59.728
LAURA: I just didn't know if you were
really listening to us or not.

1329
00:56:59.728 --> 00:57:03.096
MATT: "I'm, to be fair--" and he steeples his fingers

1330
00:57:03.096 --> 00:57:05.284
from underneath his cloak-- "I have a lot of plates

1331
00:57:05.284 --> 00:57:07.739
"I'm spinning at any given point in time.

1332
00:57:07.739 --> 00:57:12.328
"This is one, and I'm now giving it
a bit more prominence, so...

1333
00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:15.289
"I apologize to have misled you to think otherwise.

1334
00:57:15.289 --> 00:57:17.593
"And I also apologize for my

1335
00:57:17.593 --> 00:57:22.336
"attitude yesterday. I have been under some pressure."

1336
00:57:22.336 --> 00:57:27.144
LIAM: Not at all, we are trying to be of use here.

1337
00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:29.627
Can we be of use?

1338
00:57:37.139 --> 00:57:40.966
MATT: He looks back over at the door.

1339
00:57:40.966 --> 00:57:43.541
"Your usefulness currently,

1340
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:45.063
"by the mind of the Bright Queen,

1341
00:57:45.063 --> 00:57:48.039
"is in offering a tactical advantage

1342
00:57:48.039 --> 00:57:49.384
"or any information you've gleaned

1343
00:57:49.384 --> 00:57:51.877
"from the Empire's military movements.

1344
00:57:51.877 --> 00:57:55.321
"You've been a great aid in that once already,

1345
00:57:55.321 --> 00:57:57.203
"and so they are very interested

1346
00:57:57.203 --> 00:58:00.847
"in anything else you've heard.

1347
00:58:00.847 --> 00:58:04.036
"Locally, I don't know what much you can do,

1348
00:58:04.036 --> 00:58:09.036
"but just speaking of the interests above me,

1349
00:58:09.102 --> 00:58:11.552
"if there's any information you can find, glean,

1350
00:58:11.552 --> 00:58:15.528
"or have heard of any sort of military movements

1351
00:58:15.528 --> 00:58:19.212
"of the Empire that could put us in a

1352
00:58:19.212 --> 00:58:22.115
"continuous advantageous position,

1353
00:58:22.115 --> 00:58:24.260
"she'll be extremely grateful."

1354
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:28.677
TALIESIN: There is, I think,
one thing that we could say that--

1355
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:32.595
There's something that if it were considered

1356
00:58:32.595 --> 00:58:35.298
could be advantageous, although,

1357
00:58:35.298 --> 00:58:40.265
to an uncreative mind it may not seem useful.

1358
00:58:44.296 --> 00:58:47.809
There are more than two parties at work

1359
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:50.226
in this conflict of yours,

1360
00:58:51.481 --> 00:58:53.128
and I think this dual thinking

1361
00:58:53.128 --> 00:58:56.523
is going to be the end of you if you're not careful.

1362
00:58:57.989 --> 00:59:00.548
And I would say that

1363
00:59:02.065 --> 00:59:05.982
we feel pretty confident that there are people within

1364
00:59:05.982 --> 00:59:09.381
the Empire working against the Empire,

1365
00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:10.853
and there are people in the Dynasty

1366
00:59:10.853 --> 00:59:12.927
working against the Dynasty.

1367
00:59:12.927 --> 00:59:15.844
And perhaps these people are working together.

1368
00:59:17.752 --> 00:59:20.062
And if you are one of those people,

1369
00:59:20.062 --> 00:59:21.263
and we're hoping you're not,

1370
00:59:21.263 --> 00:59:24.534
then this information will never go any further than this

1371
00:59:24.534 --> 00:59:26.931
and that's the end of that.

1372
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:29.673
But if you're not, maybe it will

1373
00:59:29.673 --> 00:59:32.382
make its way higher up.

1374
00:59:32.382 --> 00:59:36.499
LIAM: We feel more firmly than ever that this war is a game.

1375
00:59:37.661 --> 00:59:39.629
That these two nations are being thrust into

1376
00:59:39.629 --> 00:59:41.962
for someone's else purposes.

1377
00:59:45.678 --> 00:59:47.928
MATT: "I appreciate your candor.

1378
00:59:51.539 --> 00:59:56.539
"I will take this information to the right, trusted few,

1379
00:59:58.951 --> 01:00:00.780
"and only after very careful

1380
01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.176
"vetting on my end as well.

1381
01:00:02.176 --> 01:00:05.336
"If what you say is true, then that is...

1382
01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:07.237
"very much disconcerting."

1383
01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:11.670
TRAVIS: Can I raise my eyes slightly
and see if the sphere is still there?

1384
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.312
TALIESIN: Insight check that.

1385
01:00:13.312 --> 01:00:15.428
MARISHA: Insight check? Yeah, same.

1386
01:00:15.428 --> 01:00:16.589
MATT: Insight check?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1387
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:19.330
MATT: Go for it. Insight check, and you're looking to see--

1388
01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:20.906
TRAVIS: I just want to see if the sphere is still up there.

1389
01:00:20.906 --> 01:00:23.685
MATT: Yeah, it's still-- it's coasted and it's now moved

1390
01:00:23.685 --> 01:00:25.884
center of the chamber and is hovering

1391
01:00:25.884 --> 01:00:27.285
above of all you.

1392
01:00:28.413 --> 01:00:29.684
LIAM: 19.

1393
01:00:29.684 --> 01:00:31.600
MATT: 19?
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1394
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.838
MATT: On the insight check?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1395
01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:36.091
SAM: Double whispers, double whispers!

1396
01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:41.091
Guys, pins, pins, chibi Yasha.
MATT: What's the total on insight?

1397
01:00:41.462 --> 01:00:44.847
TALIESIN: Because I gave myself a little--

1398
01:00:44.847 --> 01:00:46.852
Couldn't have given myself a thing, dammit, never mind.

1399
01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:48.085
SAM: Chibi Laura Bailey.

1400
01:00:48.085 --> 01:00:50.688
Ooh, I would buy that pin.
TALIESIN: 29.

1401
01:00:50.688 --> 01:00:53.491
TRAVIS: 29 total insight check?

1402
01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:54.648
TALIESIN: It's hard to lie to me.

1403
01:00:54.648 --> 01:00:56.098
TRAVIS: You know more about them than they do.

1404
01:00:56.098 --> 01:00:57.456
TALIESIN: I know more about you than you do.

1405
01:00:57.456 --> 01:00:59.321
TRAVIS: That's probably true.

1406
01:01:00.404 --> 01:01:04.527
I keep asking you tell me and you just won't!

1407
01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.444
SAM: Skybound!

1408
01:01:07.666 --> 01:01:10.066
Dwarven Forge.
TRAVIS: Don't hurt yourself.

1409
01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:13.170
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, these are all fabulous,

1410
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.992
fabulous supporters of Critical Role.

1411
01:01:16.959 --> 01:01:19.626
TRAVIS: Can we comment on how miraculous your healing--

1412
01:01:19.626 --> 01:01:21.259
LAURA: Yeah, you look really good!

1413
01:01:21.259 --> 01:01:23.725
SAM: I got an adrenaline shot right before--

1414
01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:26.048
(laughter)
TRAVIS: B12.

1415
01:01:28.412 --> 01:01:30.162
TALIESIN: We appreciate that.

1416
01:01:31.362 --> 01:01:33.824
MATT: "Well."
TALIESIN: Good luck.

1417
01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:35.733
MATT: "You as well.

1418
01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:37.983
"Should any more concrete--

1419
01:01:39.312 --> 01:01:43.573
"anything I can bring to the Bright Queen about this

1420
01:01:43.573 --> 01:01:47.628
"threat that you're after, this Obann, this Angel of Irons,

1421
01:01:47.628 --> 01:01:49.857
"whether I find it first or you do, but anything that

1422
01:01:49.857 --> 01:01:53.657
"you think could draw her attention
away from this conflict and perhaps

1423
01:01:53.657 --> 01:01:55.810
"focus on this thing--"
LAURA: They said that

1424
01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:59.233
Caedogeist was a servant of who?

1425
01:01:59.233 --> 01:02:00.066
MARISHA and LIAM: Lolth.

1426
01:02:01.773 --> 01:02:04.901
MATT: "That is certainly of interest to the Queen.

1427
01:02:04.901 --> 01:02:07.734
MARISHA: He had a contract with Asmodeus.

1428
01:02:10.931 --> 01:02:13.369
MATT: "That is a strange union.

1429
01:02:13.369 --> 01:02:15.388
"I'm not brushed up on my history but--"

1430
01:02:15.388 --> 01:02:18.500
LIAM: Referred to as an assassin for Lolth.

1431
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.517
MATT: "I will look into this."

1432
01:02:20.517 --> 01:02:23.040
TALIESIN: We will share whatever information we can

1433
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.339
without compromising our very complicated position.
LAURA: I'll keep in touch with you.

1434
01:02:26.339 --> 01:02:29.198
MATT: "I am certain you will, your timing is impeccable."

1435
01:02:29.198 --> 01:02:31.623
LAURA: Best friends all the time, just think of it.

1436
01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:33.112
Is there a certain time of day

1437
01:02:33.112 --> 01:02:35.965
that's, like, better for me to contact you,

1438
01:02:35.965 --> 01:02:38.007
so that maybe I'm not interrupting anything?

1439
01:02:38.007 --> 01:02:43.007
MATT: "Preferably no later than midnight, Xhorhas time."

1440
01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:45.323
LAURA: Okay, I'll ask you, you'll remember, Caleb,

1441
01:02:45.323 --> 01:02:47.512
what time it is here all the time, <i>ja</i>?

1442
01:02:47.512 --> 01:02:48.552
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

1443
01:02:48.552 --> 01:02:52.671
LAURA: And would like a breakfast message, if possible?

1444
01:02:52.671 --> 01:02:55.408
Do you like dinner messages? When do you check your emails?

1445
01:02:55.408 --> 01:02:58.644
TALIESIN: Quote of the day, maybe,
it's like Quote of the Day.

1446
01:02:58.644 --> 01:03:00.081
MATT: "I don't think it would make a difference,

1447
01:03:00.081 --> 01:03:02.341
"so whatever suits your fancy."

1448
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:03.582
LAURA: Okay.

1449
01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.289
MATT: "Good luck."

1450
01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:10.343
TRAVIS: Same to you.
MATT: "Thank you."

1451
01:03:10.343 --> 01:03:12.454
SAM: Don't trust anyone.

1452
01:03:12.454 --> 01:03:14.523
Not even us.

1453
01:03:14.523 --> 01:03:16.696
TRAVIS: Nott, we want him to trust us.

1454
01:03:16.696 --> 01:03:18.665
SAM: Don't even trust us.

1455
01:03:18.665 --> 01:03:21.665
LAURA: Stop, she's just fucking with you.

1456
01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:30.215
MATT: "Right, anyway, keep in touch,"

1457
01:03:30.215 --> 01:03:32.598
and he turns around and glides his way towards the door.

1458
01:03:32.598 --> 01:03:34.938
(dingly chimes)

1459
01:03:34.938 --> 01:03:39.678
Opens once more, the guards awaiting him, and they exit.

1460
01:03:39.678 --> 01:03:42.011
LAURA: Is the ball still there?
MARISHA: Does the ball fly, yeah?

1461
01:03:42.011 --> 01:03:43.947
LAURA: Because that thing's lasting for a long time.

1462
01:03:43.947 --> 01:03:47.906
TRAVIS: Is there a tennis ball on the ceiling?

1463
01:03:47.906 --> 01:03:51.961
SAM: Because it's time to go to Rexxentrum soon.

1464
01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.650
Which is where we're going!

1465
01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:55.678
MARISHA: Gotta get more information!

1466
01:03:55.678 --> 01:03:59.584
MATT: About ten or so minute mark since it first arrived,

1467
01:03:59.584 --> 01:04:02.041
it (whooshes) dissipates.

1468
01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:03.722
MARISHA: Ten minutes?
SAM: All right, we're clear?

1469
01:04:03.722 --> 01:04:05.973
TRAVIS: It's gone.
LAURA: That's a good amount of scry.

1470
01:04:05.973 --> 01:04:08.323
SAM: Let's go to Rexxentrum!

1471
01:04:09.784 --> 01:04:11.654
TRAVIS: We're not actually going.

1472
01:04:11.654 --> 01:04:15.416
MARISHA: We didn't get shit from Obann, right?

1473
01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:16.699
SAM: Like items? No.

1474
01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:18.211
MARISHA: I mean, Essek, sorry.

1475
01:04:18.211 --> 01:04:21.266
LAURA: No, but he is putting in words and--

1476
01:04:21.266 --> 01:04:23.478
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's encouraging that he's working on it.

1477
01:04:23.478 --> 01:04:24.311
LAURA: Yeah.

1478
01:04:25.251 --> 01:04:28.393
TALIESIN: And now-- I mean, in theory,

1479
01:04:29.725 --> 01:04:32.432
it's possible that the Bright Queen heard all of that.

1480
01:04:32.432 --> 01:04:34.444
TRAVIS: Yeah, we didn't say anything to incriminate him.

1481
01:04:34.444 --> 01:04:38.203
He certainly said anything against
the Empire we can provide--

1482
01:04:38.203 --> 01:04:42.362
SAM: Also, he let us know our place in things over here.

1483
01:04:42.362 --> 01:04:45.472
We are still being kept at a distance.

1484
01:04:45.472 --> 01:04:47.510
LIAM: Seemed a little on edge to me.

1485
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.987
LAURA: Maybe he's been under watch.

1486
01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:52.102
Because of the things that we've been doing.

1487
01:04:52.102 --> 01:04:55.052
TALIESIN: To be fair, now she'll know if
he's not telling her

1488
01:04:55.052 --> 01:04:56.318
any of the stuff that we tell him.

1489
01:04:56.318 --> 01:04:57.289
LAURA: That is true.

1490
01:04:57.289 --> 01:05:00.866
SAM: It just makes our path forward even more clear.

1491
01:05:00.866 --> 01:05:03.852
We go where there is no Dynasty and Empire.

1492
01:05:03.852 --> 01:05:08.114
We go and we find the wizard and we figure out

1493
01:05:08.114 --> 01:05:10.627
what our next step is.

1494
01:05:10.627 --> 01:05:14.818
LIAM: Unfortunately, I feel that the jury
is still out on Essek.

1495
01:05:14.818 --> 01:05:16.506
TRAVIS: I just realized, I should have at least

1496
01:05:16.506 --> 01:05:19.200
left the room for a moment,

1497
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.006
tried to isolate who or what it's--

1498
01:05:22.006 --> 01:05:25.579
I mean, if it's just on the Xhorhouse--

1499
01:05:25.579 --> 01:05:27.582
well sure, but what if it's not?

1500
01:05:27.582 --> 01:05:29.286
TALIESIN: In the long run, it means--

1501
01:05:29.286 --> 01:05:30.606
TRAVIS: It did follow us upstairs.

1502
01:05:30.606 --> 01:05:32.362
TALIESIN: At the very least means that
someone else knows about

1503
01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:35.401
that conversation, which is in the end,

1504
01:05:35.401 --> 01:05:37.777
whether or not he's telling the truth or not

1505
01:05:37.777 --> 01:05:40.796
it has now possibly put him in the position

1506
01:05:40.796 --> 01:05:43.792
where he's going to have to defend it if he isn't.

1507
01:05:44.734 --> 01:05:46.681
It just seemed to be the thing to do is

1508
01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:49.176
tell the truth in front of two people and see who

1509
01:05:49.176 --> 01:05:50.298
commits to it.
TRAVIS: It was the right call.

1510
01:05:50.298 --> 01:05:52.714
LIAM: We certainly want to keep up appearances, regardless.

1511
01:05:52.714 --> 01:05:55.469
SAM: Well, let's get going before that ball comes back.

1512
01:05:55.469 --> 01:05:57.841
LIAM: Right, to "Rexxentrum."
MARISHA: I'm also very

1513
01:05:57.841 --> 01:06:00.909
curious to see if that ball follows us.

1514
01:06:00.909 --> 01:06:02.344
TALIESIN: That'll be interesting.
TRAVIS: Got an hour!

1515
01:06:02.344 --> 01:06:04.019
MARISHA: That'll be interesting.

1516
01:06:04.019 --> 01:06:06.025
TALIESIN: Hadn't even thought of that.

1517
01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:07.416
MARISHA: Like, outside this house.

1518
01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:10.174
TRAVIS: I can only do it for one hour a day, so.

1519
01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:12.293
LAURA: Hope you pick a good time, then!

1520
01:06:12.293 --> 01:06:14.705
Maybe we can constantly just Dispel!

1521
01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:18.033
LIAM: Catch it in its ten minute period.

1522
01:06:18.033 --> 01:06:20.229
SAM: You know what, though, if we go talk to the wizard,

1523
01:06:20.229 --> 01:06:22.375
something tells me that he will be able to sense--

1524
01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:25.266
ALL: ♪ When we meet the wizard ♪

1525
01:06:25.266 --> 01:06:27.711
LAURA: ♪ Once we prove our worth ♪

1526
01:06:27.711 --> 01:06:30.376
SAM: I think I'm already drunk.

1527
01:06:30.376 --> 01:06:32.910
It sounds like everyone's singing.

1528
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:34.726
TRAVIS: ♪ What I've waited for since ♪

1529
01:06:34.726 --> 01:06:36.430
SAM: Why don't we just, when we get to Yussa,

1530
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:39.489
we'll tell him people may be scrying so

1531
01:06:39.489 --> 01:06:41.733
maybe he can do a little something something.

1532
01:06:41.733 --> 01:06:44.344
TALIESIN: Let's maybe have that conversation once we've--

1533
01:06:44.344 --> 01:06:45.432
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

1534
01:06:45.432 --> 01:06:49.686
TALIESIN: Ixnayed the outway of the scryway,

1535
01:06:49.686 --> 01:06:50.519
I don't know what I was saying.

1536
01:06:50.519 --> 01:06:52.886
TRAVIS: Caleb, Bob Ross us a circle.

1537
01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:56.400
LAURA: ♪ Let's do it, where's your friend? ♪

1538
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.582
♪ We should make sure they are here. ♪

1539
01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:00.465
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, Dairon!

1540
01:07:00.465 --> 01:07:02.170
MATT: At which point--
LIAM: I'll start it,

1541
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:03.769
I'll start it, I won't finish it, though.

1542
01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:08.066
MATT: There's a small alcove underneath the stairs

1543
01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:09.636
that descend from the second floor,

1544
01:07:09.636 --> 01:07:14.291
and Dairon swiftly, feet kick out and land on--

1545
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.474
ready to go.

1546
01:07:15.474 --> 01:07:17.965
MARISHA: Has that alcove been there the whole time?

1547
01:07:17.965 --> 01:07:19.359
TRAVIS: Fuck.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1548
01:07:19.359 --> 01:07:24.160
MATT: "It was hidden by furniture, but I've made use of it."

1549
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.251
SAM: I throw the chair down again.

1550
01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:28.048
LAURA: Wonder if other people have ever been in there

1551
01:07:28.048 --> 01:07:29.540
spying on us when we're in the house?

1552
01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.702
MARISHA: That's awesome.

1553
01:07:30.702 --> 01:07:32.058
LAURA: I wonder if they saw us getting naked

1554
01:07:32.058 --> 01:07:34.874
when we were going down to the jacuzzi.

1555
01:07:34.874 --> 01:07:37.103
TRAVIS: You were naked in the jacuzzi?

1556
01:07:37.103 --> 01:07:37.936
SAM: Sure.

1557
01:07:37.936 --> 01:07:41.017
LAURA: That's how you're supposed to be.
TALIESIN: That's usually how you do a jacuzzi.

1558
01:07:41.017 --> 01:07:43.038
TRAVIS: Sure, I knew that.

1559
01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:44.791
(laughter)

1560
01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:46.781
MATT: You complete the creation
of your teleportation circle.

1561
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:50.154
(whooshes) It flashes, the sparkling light

1562
01:07:50.154 --> 01:07:52.580
of the arcane sigil begins to rise up off of it

1563
01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:55.159
for the brief moment that it's available.
Do you guys all rush in?

1564
01:07:55.159 --> 01:07:56.583
(various agreements and rallying cries)

1565
01:07:56.583 --> 01:07:58.564
LIAM: Just a happy little sigil.

1566
01:07:58.564 --> 01:08:00.867
(laughter)

1567
01:08:00.867 --> 01:08:03.784
TALIESIN: Hey, everybody, I got the--

1568
01:08:05.904 --> 01:08:07.332
MATT: As Caduceus rushes through,

1569
01:08:07.332 --> 01:08:10.756
holding a now spilling plate of tea.

1570
01:08:10.756 --> 01:08:12.058
TALIESIN: My tea cake's gone!

1571
01:08:12.058 --> 01:08:13.978
LIAM: Kevin, we forgot Kevin!

1572
01:08:13.978 --> 01:08:15.367
(laughter)

1573
01:08:15.367 --> 01:08:17.234
MATT: I just envision you rushing through like the

1574
01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:19.901
old butler in Tomb Raider. (rattling)

1575
01:08:21.842 --> 01:08:25.330
You all immediately step down into a darkened

1576
01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:29.434
stone interior space, one you recall previously

1577
01:08:29.434 --> 01:08:33.027
as the reception chamber for teleportation

1578
01:08:33.027 --> 01:08:35.508
within Tide Peak Tower.

1579
01:08:35.508 --> 01:08:36.799
LAURA: Tide Peak Tower!

1580
01:08:36.799 --> 01:08:38.433
LIAM: And this was up top, right?
MARISHA: Aw shit.

1581
01:08:38.433 --> 01:08:40.202
MATT: It was partway up.
LAURA: What?

1582
01:08:40.202 --> 01:08:42.037
LIAM: Not ground floor.
TRAVIS: We didn't announce ourselves.

1583
01:08:42.037 --> 01:08:44.028
MARISHA: Yes, we did it again!

1584
01:08:44.028 --> 01:08:45.398
LIAM: We said we would tell him.

1585
01:08:45.398 --> 01:08:48.663
SAM: Wait, last time we did this,
we called him from this room.

1586
01:08:48.663 --> 01:08:50.807
Do it again!
MARISHA: We cannot do that again!

1587
01:08:50.807 --> 01:08:52.724
LAURA: Okay, I'll do Sending.

1588
01:08:52.724 --> 01:08:56.649
Oh, hey, guess what? We're going to

1589
01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:58.540
come here in a little bit.

1590
01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.428
We're going to be here in this tower in a little bit--

1591
01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:03.168
SAM: Here? <i>Here</i> in this tower?

1592
01:09:03.168 --> 01:09:05.740
LAURA: Um--
SAM: You mean "there"!

1593
01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:09.490
LAURA: Just let us know when it's good to come in!

1594
01:09:10.456 --> 01:09:12.232
MATT: Roll a percentage dice for me, if you don't mind.

1595
01:09:12.232 --> 01:09:13.916
LAURA: Me?
SAM: A percentage dice?

1596
01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:14.749
MATT: Percentile dice.

1597
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:16.526
LAURA: I roll two--
MATT: Two tens.

1598
01:09:16.526 --> 01:09:19.154
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.
TALIESIN: And pick one of them as the 10.

1599
01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:23.001
LAURA: The pink one is the 10, 32%.

1600
01:09:23.001 --> 01:09:24.209
MATT: Okay.

1601
01:09:28.495 --> 01:09:31.778
The message is received, but there's no response.

1602
01:09:32.637 --> 01:09:37.301
LAURA: Well, I know he heard me, I could tell he heard me.

1603
01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:40.560
MARISHA: Should we just all wait a little bit

1604
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.631
and then jump at the same time, like we just arrived?

1605
01:09:43.631 --> 01:09:45.916
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1606
01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.842
SAM: Three, two, one!

1607
01:09:47.842 --> 01:09:49.783
(inhaling)
(grunting)

1608
01:09:49.783 --> 01:09:51.529
TRAVIS: Aww, fuck.

1609
01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:53.241
SAM: We're here!
LAURA: Every time.

1610
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:55.200
MATT: Another minute passes and you hear the faint sound

1611
01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.540
of footsteps down the stairs, quickly.

1612
01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.691
(quick footsteps)

1613
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:00.732
(door creaks)

1614
01:10:00.732 --> 01:10:02.139
The door opens up.

1615
01:10:02.139 --> 01:10:03.973
From the dark, lightless interior,

1616
01:10:03.973 --> 01:10:07.570
suddenly you can see framed the small figure of a goblin.

1617
01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:11.209
There you see Wensforth, still well-dressed.

1618
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:15.592
Somewhat portly in the torso, glasses on the face.

1619
01:10:15.592 --> 01:10:19.894
Opens the door, "Um, hello?"

1620
01:10:19.894 --> 01:10:20.856
LAURA: Hi!

1621
01:10:20.856 --> 01:10:23.515
TALIESIN: We apologize--
LAURA: We sent a message

1622
01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:26.071
a little bit ago and said we were going to pop in.

1623
01:10:26.071 --> 01:10:27.644
I know that he heard us, but

1624
01:10:27.644 --> 01:10:29.553
he didn't respond, I'm assuming it's because--

1625
01:10:29.553 --> 01:10:31.318
SAM: Where's the master?

1626
01:10:31.318 --> 01:10:33.504
MATT: "(stammering)

1627
01:10:33.504 --> 01:10:35.494
"Come-- come with me, if you don't mind,

1628
01:10:35.494 --> 01:10:37.269
"just-- just follow me for a moment--

1629
01:10:37.269 --> 01:10:38.832
LIAM: Are we good?
MATT: "-- this way."

1630
01:10:38.832 --> 01:10:40.315
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, more or less."

1631
01:10:40.315 --> 01:10:41.865
MARISHA: Does he look okay?

1632
01:10:41.865 --> 01:10:43.571
MATT: Make an insight check.

1633
01:10:43.571 --> 01:10:45.783
SAM: What's his name again?
LIAM: He doesn't really look okay.

1634
01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.643
MARISHA: Wensworth?
MATT: Wensforth.

1635
01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.318
MARISHA: Fucking fuck.

1636
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.480
11.

1637
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.746
MATT: 11, eh, he looks like a goblin.

1638
01:10:54.746 --> 01:10:56.059
That's well dressed.

1639
01:10:56.059 --> 01:10:58.618
Dairon at this point goes, "Well--"

1640
01:10:58.618 --> 01:11:01.508
Drops the guise of the dark elf.

1641
01:11:01.508 --> 01:11:05.432
"I will make my way quickly back to Zadash."

1642
01:11:05.432 --> 01:11:07.904
LIAM: This is a very interesting building,
I would be very careful if you think

1643
01:11:07.904 --> 01:11:11.125
you're going to run out of here.

1644
01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:12.358
MATT: "What sort of interesting?"

1645
01:11:12.358 --> 01:11:15.337
Wensforth goes, "Oh, don't worry, just head down

1646
01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:17.020
"to the foyer area, and the door,

1647
01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.009
"push it open from the inside."

1648
01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:23.665
Dairon goes, "Very well, let me know if you need anything."

1649
01:11:23.665 --> 01:11:24.877
LIAM: Easy does it.
TALIESIN: Good luck.

1650
01:11:24.877 --> 01:11:26.512
MATT: And she rushes off.
TRAVIS: Are you high fiving?

1651
01:11:26.512 --> 01:11:28.697
LAURA: High five on the way out, high five?

1652
01:11:28.697 --> 01:11:30.735
(clapping)
MARISHA: We'll be in contact.

1653
01:11:30.735 --> 01:11:32.894
MATT: Very callused palms, like surprisingly so.

1654
01:11:32.894 --> 01:11:35.674
MARISHA: Let me know about those parking tickets!

1655
01:11:35.674 --> 01:11:36.891
(chuckles)

1656
01:11:36.891 --> 01:11:38.042
MATT: There's a moment as Dairon stops and

1657
01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:41.983
looks back at you, goes--
and then darts down.

1658
01:11:41.983 --> 01:11:43.849
TALIESIN: Cool stuff you guys
were doing last night.

1659
01:11:43.849 --> 01:11:45.965
TRAVIS: Change my grades in the computer.
MARISHA: You were watching?

1660
01:11:45.965 --> 01:11:48.256
TALIESIN: I was in the hot tub, I was just
very quiet the whole time.

1661
01:11:48.256 --> 01:11:50.681
I was just trying not to--
MARISHA: Oh, I kind of forgot you were there.

1662
01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.478
TALIESIN: I'm aware, I just sitting right there,

1663
01:11:52.478 --> 01:11:54.292
trying really to be quiet.
TRAVIS: Gross.

1664
01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:58.151
MATT: Wensforth at this point goes, "All right, um--

1665
01:11:58.151 --> 01:12:01.152
"(laughs awkwardly) follow me."
TRAVIS: Lead the way, please, yeah.

1666
01:12:01.152 --> 01:12:02.637
MATT: "This way,"

1667
01:12:02.637 --> 01:12:05.907
and leads you up the spiral staircase to the next landing,

1668
01:12:05.907 --> 01:12:07.920
and there on that landing you can see there

1669
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.897
it seems wider than the previous level of the tower was.

1670
01:12:11.897 --> 01:12:15.928
It seems to bow outward, and there are three doors.

1671
01:12:15.928 --> 01:12:18.760
One of the doors is ajar,

1672
01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.720
and he steps inside to the chamber.

1673
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.457
LAURA: (laughs)

1674
01:12:23.457 --> 01:12:25.465
MATT: Just confusing you on both fronts
in that phrase, sorry.

1675
01:12:25.465 --> 01:12:27.206
TALIESIN: Carry on, carry on.

1676
01:12:27.206 --> 01:12:31.048
MATT: Into a wide chamber of patterned wallpaper

1677
01:12:31.048 --> 01:12:35.298
surrounded by bookshelves and cases and tapestries.

1678
01:12:37.834 --> 01:12:39.472
Wensforth turns around and goes,

1679
01:12:39.472 --> 01:12:43.621
"Um, heh. Can I ask some advice from you folks?"

1680
01:12:43.621 --> 01:12:44.820
TRAVIS: Of course.
SAM: Yes.

1681
01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.917
TALIESIN: I don't think anyone's ever done that before.

1682
01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:52.345
MATT: "So..." and he points to the center of the chamber,

1683
01:12:52.345 --> 01:12:54.753
and you can see surrounded by plush leather furniture,

1684
01:12:54.753 --> 01:12:57.400
there's a worktable that's lit by a hanging glass globe

1685
01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.668
emitting a bright light over a metallic sphere--

1686
01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:04.289
SAM and LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: --on the table.

1687
01:13:04.289 --> 01:13:05.779
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.
MARISHA: He went in!

1688
01:13:05.779 --> 01:13:08.212
MATT: All manner of instruments and devices, tools

1689
01:13:08.212 --> 01:13:09.963
are scattered across the outside of it,

1690
01:13:09.963 --> 01:13:12.686
it's a set of goggles with multiple lenses open.

1691
01:13:12.686 --> 01:13:13.602
He goes,

1692
01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:16.278
"The master's

1693
01:13:16.278 --> 01:13:20.287
"been delving into that object that you gave him.

1694
01:13:20.287 --> 01:13:22.929
"Spends days, sometimes weeks

1695
01:13:22.929 --> 01:13:24.571
"at a time within the sphere."

1696
01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:26.720
LIAM: How long has he been gone this time?

1697
01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.979
MATT: "This time, three weeks, I'm a bit worried.

1698
01:13:29.979 --> 01:13:33.207
"I've not heard from him.
He gave me the ability

1699
01:13:33.207 --> 01:13:37.941
"to contact an ally to get his aid if it gets worrying.

1700
01:13:37.941 --> 01:13:39.708
"I'm uncertain if it's been enough time

1701
01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:43.141
"and I know he'd be unhappy if I leapt too early, so.

1702
01:13:43.141 --> 01:13:46.749
"I'm just asking you, as the ones who gave him the ball,

1703
01:13:46.749 --> 01:13:47.891
"do you think it's okay for me to do that,

1704
01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:49.691
"is it too early, should I wait?"

1705
01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:52.126
SAM: What ally would you contact?

1706
01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:54.948
MATT: "I don't know the name,
he just gave me a Sending stone."

1707
01:13:54.948 --> 01:13:56.681
TRAVIS: Caleb, how long were we gone,

1708
01:13:56.681 --> 01:13:58.048
do you remember, when we came out?

1709
01:13:58.048 --> 01:13:59.273
LAURA: We were gone seven days.

1710
01:13:59.273 --> 01:14:01.874
TRAVIS: A week.
MATT: Five days, I think.

1711
01:14:01.874 --> 01:14:03.671
SAM: But we made a vow, that if any us

1712
01:14:03.671 --> 01:14:05.546
were gone for seven days, we would assume

1713
01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:07.822
they were dead and have a funeral.

1714
01:14:07.822 --> 01:14:10.584
TALIESIN: Did we?
SAM: Yes. That was a--

1715
01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:12.125
MATT: You see Wensforth's face just

1716
01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.783
drop and go pale.
TRAVIS: That's an unusual thing

1717
01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:17.259
to remember at this moment when his master is missing.

1718
01:14:17.259 --> 01:14:20.233
MARISHA: Well, look, time gets weird in the Happy Fun Ball,

1719
01:14:20.233 --> 01:14:23.930
right? That's why we didn't know that it was seven days.

1720
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:26.655
LAURA: It only felt like an hour to us.

1721
01:14:26.655 --> 01:14:28.431
TRAVIS: And no instructions on who to contact?

1722
01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:30.815
SAM: No, he said he has a Sending stone.

1723
01:14:30.815 --> 01:14:35.247
MATT: "It's--" and he points over off an end table

1724
01:14:35.247 --> 01:14:36.706
off to the side of the chamber underneath

1725
01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:38.377
one of the tapestries, you can see

1726
01:14:38.377 --> 01:14:42.201
a smooth, polished, looks like a river stone,

1727
01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:44.700
but it's a light blue tint.

1728
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.622
"I'm supposed to get that

1729
01:14:46.622 --> 01:14:49.261
"to ask them for help, but only if it's necessary.

1730
01:14:49.261 --> 01:14:51.494
"I don't want to have to do this favor

1731
01:14:51.494 --> 01:14:54.017
"if the master said I'm supposed to wait longer.

1732
01:14:54.017 --> 01:14:56.267
"But, I just-- (stutters and stumbles)

1733
01:14:56.267 --> 01:14:57.283
What do you think?"

1734
01:14:57.283 --> 01:15:00.462
LIAM: How much does that stone
look like the stone in my bag?

1735
01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:03.805
MATT: It's a similar design, though different color.

1736
01:15:03.805 --> 01:15:06.730
TRAVIS: Do you know where that goes?
LAURA: No, he doesn't know.

1737
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:07.612
SAM: So our options are--

1738
01:15:07.612 --> 01:15:09.524
TALIESIN: How long are you
supposed to wait, out of curiosity?

1739
01:15:09.524 --> 01:15:11.635
MATT: "He didn't say, he said when it felt right."

1740
01:15:11.635 --> 01:15:13.253
LAURA: When it felt right.
TRAVIS: We're going in.

1741
01:15:13.253 --> 01:15:16.654
SAM: So we either go in, or we use the Sending Stone

1742
01:15:16.654 --> 01:15:18.799
to call in someone.
TALIESIN: Or both.

1743
01:15:18.799 --> 01:15:22.372
MARISHA: Can you like <i>69</i> this? Can you reverse see

1744
01:15:22.372 --> 01:15:25.469
who's on the other side of the Sending stone,

1745
01:15:25.469 --> 01:15:26.711
is that something you could tell?

1746
01:15:26.711 --> 01:15:28.432
LIAM: I was not able to before.
TRAVIS: (phone tones)

1747
01:15:28.432 --> 01:15:30.358
"We're sorry, the number you dialed..."

1748
01:15:30.358 --> 01:15:33.078
LAURA: What if we do it, and then whoever is the ally,

1749
01:15:33.078 --> 01:15:34.761
we go in with them?

1750
01:15:34.761 --> 01:15:37.677
SAM: What if they're not an ally of us?

1751
01:15:37.677 --> 01:15:39.665
LAURA: We don't have any allies.

1752
01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:42.290
MATT: "They're an ally of the master's, so

1753
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:43.902
"I think they're trustworthy?"

1754
01:15:43.902 --> 01:15:44.784
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: "I think."

1755
01:15:44.784 --> 01:15:45.617
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

1756
01:15:45.617 --> 01:15:47.708
MARISHA: Do we have any active enemies that we can think of,

1757
01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:50.716
other than, like, Obann and the Horsemen?

1758
01:15:50.716 --> 01:15:52.749
TALIESIN: (laughs) Sorry, sorry.

1759
01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:53.756
TRAVIS: Question, question, question.

1760
01:15:53.756 --> 01:15:56.396
The stone brings them to us or us to them?

1761
01:15:56.396 --> 01:15:58.653
SAM: Just talks.
MATT: "The stone just talks."

1762
01:15:58.653 --> 01:16:00.516
LAURA: Oh, let's just talk to them.

1763
01:16:00.516 --> 01:16:02.570
I'm really good at Sending.

1764
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:04.398
MATT: "Okay, so yes?

1765
01:16:04.398 --> 01:16:07.196
"You're giving me permission to use the stone?"

1766
01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:09.900
TRAVIS: Yes, you can say we forced you--

1767
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.277
LAURA: No, no!
MATT: "Oh, perfect!"

1768
01:16:12.277 --> 01:16:14.077
Runs over and grabs the stone and takes it

1769
01:16:14.077 --> 01:16:16.504
and rubs the front and goes like, (exhales)

1770
01:16:16.504 --> 01:16:18.046
LAURA: You hold it up, are you supposed to hold it up--

1771
01:16:18.046 --> 01:16:19.604
MATT: "Hello?"

1772
01:16:19.604 --> 01:16:22.072
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh, hi!

1773
01:16:22.072 --> 01:16:24.735
MATT: "Sorry to bother you, this is Wensforth,

1774
01:16:24.735 --> 01:16:28.220
"I'm the assistant to the esteemed Archmage Yussa Errenis.

1775
01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.500
"Um-- I was given your stone in case of emergency,

1776
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.124
"which I believe has transpired."

1777
01:16:33.124 --> 01:16:34.774
LAURA: Who is it?
MATT: "Hold on.

1778
01:16:34.774 --> 01:16:38.200
"I am with friends, might we have a word with you?"

1779
01:16:39.184 --> 01:16:41.233
MARISHA: Yo, can you put him on speaker?

1780
01:16:41.233 --> 01:16:43.522
(laughter)

1781
01:16:43.522 --> 01:16:45.038
MATT: "No, at the tower."

1782
01:16:45.038 --> 01:16:46.682
LAURA: Who is it?
MATT: "Okay, thank you."

1783
01:16:46.682 --> 01:16:48.669
LAURA: Did you ask who it was?
MATT: "No, I forgot."

1784
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:50.592
(laughter)
TRAVIS: The fuck?

1785
01:16:50.592 --> 01:16:52.541
MATT: "I'm nervous, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"

1786
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.362
LAURA: I was saying "who is it" the whole time!

1787
01:16:55.362 --> 01:16:56.679
MATT: "I don't know who it is!"

1788
01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.535
LAURA: That's why you ask!
MATT: "I forgot!"

1789
01:16:58.535 --> 01:17:00.713
TRAVIS: What did they--
SAM: Just have a drink, all right?

1790
01:17:00.713 --> 01:17:02.845
You need to calm your nerves; it works for me every time.

1791
01:17:02.845 --> 01:17:05.978
MATT: (whoosh) You hear a faint arrival sound,

1792
01:17:05.978 --> 01:17:08.384
a familiar sound to you, as well,

1793
01:17:08.384 --> 01:17:11.356
similar to the shunting sound of when you arrive
in a Teleportation chamber.

1794
01:17:11.356 --> 01:17:14.752
LAURA: Is that how it always sounds in here
when somebody shows up?

1795
01:17:14.752 --> 01:17:15.814
MATT: "Usually, yeah."

1796
01:17:15.814 --> 01:17:17.083
LAURA: Then what does it sound like when

1797
01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:19.951
everybody jumps a few minutes later?

1798
01:17:19.951 --> 01:17:22.783
MATT: "It's like duller, I was just sort of creeping along

1799
01:17:22.783 --> 01:17:27.514
"and the noise made me nervous, so I ran down."

1800
01:17:27.514 --> 01:17:31.095
"Anyway--" And you hear the (knocking)

1801
01:17:31.095 --> 01:17:33.555
the footfalls making their way up towards the landing.

1802
01:17:33.555 --> 01:17:34.709
SAM: I'm going to go hide somewhere.

1803
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:37.269
Behind a book.
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

1804
01:17:37.269 --> 01:17:39.825
What are you guys doing?
MARISHA: Behind a book!

1805
01:17:39.825 --> 01:17:41.629
TALIESIN: I'm just going to stand here.

1806
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:44.546
TRAVIS: I'm making myself look like Ussa.

1807
01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.677
SAM: 32.
MATT: 32.

1808
01:17:48.677 --> 01:17:50.721
MARISHA: You're making yourself look like Yussa?
TRAVIS: No, I'm not.

1809
01:17:50.721 --> 01:17:52.791
LAURA: I'm just going to stand here
with a big smile on my face.

1810
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:55.847
TALIESIN: Trying something new.
MATT: Okay.

1811
01:17:55.847 --> 01:17:58.328
From the shaded interior of the landing,

1812
01:17:58.328 --> 01:18:00.167
with a faint bit of sconce light that's coming through,

1813
01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:01.615
there's only one open window in this chamber

1814
01:18:01.615 --> 01:18:03.160
where light's coming in from the far end

1815
01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.009
and the one white orb that's hanging

1816
01:18:05.009 --> 01:18:08.497
that's lighting up the tool arrangement over the

1817
01:18:08.497 --> 01:18:12.368
brass sphere that you have deemed the "Happy Fun Ball."

1818
01:18:12.368 --> 01:18:13.674
(giggling)

1819
01:18:13.674 --> 01:18:18.646
MATT: You watch the figure enter in a bit of a huff.

1820
01:18:18.646 --> 01:18:22.364
You see what looks to be a human woman,

1821
01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.978
pale skin, light graying blond hair

1822
01:18:25.978 --> 01:18:28.212
that's braided back behind her with gems

1823
01:18:28.212 --> 01:18:29.910
tied throughout each braid.

1824
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:32.109
SAM: Who dat?
LAURA: What if it's Allura?

1825
01:18:32.109 --> 01:18:33.789
MATT: An intricate satchel over one shoulder

1826
01:18:33.789 --> 01:18:35.190
and a long dark blue dress.

1827
01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:36.897
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

1828
01:18:36.897 --> 01:18:38.210
SAM: Wait, wait.

1829
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:39.967
MATT: (familiar female voice) "All right, what has that

1830
01:18:39.967 --> 01:18:42.009
godforsaken fool gotten himself into?"

1831
01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:44.882
(gleeful screaming)
MARISHA: No way, is it really?!

1832
01:18:44.882 --> 01:18:47.335
She just looks 20 years older now?

1833
01:18:47.335 --> 01:18:50.022
(gleeful screams)

1834
01:18:50.022 --> 01:18:51.674
All wizards know each other!

1835
01:18:51.674 --> 01:18:53.704
TRAVIS: Graying blonde hair?

1836
01:18:53.704 --> 01:18:56.006
MARISHA: (screams)
TRAVIS: Maybe it's not her.

1837
01:18:56.006 --> 01:18:57.004
MARISHA: Maybe it's not, is it her?

1838
01:18:57.004 --> 01:18:59.358
MATT: The woman looks to be about in her mid-50s or so.

1839
01:18:59.358 --> 01:19:00.691
MARISHA: It checks out!

1840
01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:04.031
TRAVIS: That's it, it's definitely her!

1841
01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:05.497
Blue's a popular color,

1842
01:19:05.497 --> 01:19:08.328
it might not be her.
LIAM: That's an automatic background check on Yussa!

1843
01:19:08.328 --> 01:19:10.488
TRAVIS: It might not be her.
LIAM: (cooing)

1844
01:19:10.488 --> 01:19:12.079
SAM: I spring from the shadows!

1845
01:19:12.079 --> 01:19:13.791
(laughter)

1846
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:15.577
MATT: Do you?
(laughter)

1847
01:19:15.577 --> 01:19:18.491
TALIESIN: Take three shots, surprise attack!

1848
01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:19.900
MATT: I mean, what--

1849
01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.637
SAM: I'm just going to watch, suss her out,

1850
01:19:22.637 --> 01:19:23.572
see if she's on the up and up.

1851
01:19:23.572 --> 01:19:25.302
MATT: "Hello."

1852
01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:26.368
TALIESIN: Hey.
LAURA: Hi.

1853
01:19:26.368 --> 01:19:28.222
MATT: "And you are?"

1854
01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:29.516
LIAM: We are--

1855
01:19:29.516 --> 01:19:31.844
MATT: One hand is up nervously.

1856
01:19:31.844 --> 01:19:34.133
LAURA: We're friendly!
MARISHA: We're the Mighty Nein!

1857
01:19:34.133 --> 01:19:35.267
LIAM: The Mighty Nein.
TALIESIN: Pleasure.

1858
01:19:35.267 --> 01:19:36.318
MATT: "All right."

1859
01:19:36.318 --> 01:19:39.340
LIAM: We are friends to Yussa, I am somewhere between

1860
01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:43.915
a apprentice and protege to Master Yussa.

1861
01:19:45.462 --> 01:19:48.347
We've been here for a while,

1862
01:19:48.347 --> 01:19:51.146
and apparently, you're--

1863
01:19:51.146 --> 01:19:53.312
I'm sorry, what is your name?

1864
01:19:53.312 --> 01:19:55.053
MATT: "Well...

1865
01:19:55.053 --> 01:19:57.128
"I'm Arcanist Allura Vysoren."

1866
01:19:57.128 --> 01:19:59.275
(screams of joy)

1867
01:19:59.275 --> 01:20:00.759
TRAVIS: Give it to me!

1868
01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:02.150
(laughter)

1869
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:03.684
TALIESIN: Getting it out of our system now.

1870
01:20:03.684 --> 01:20:05.137
TRAVIS: Make it rain!

1871
01:20:06.365 --> 01:20:08.314
MARISHA: I'm going to cry.
MATT: "Master of Arcana

1872
01:20:08.314 --> 01:20:10.464
"on the Council of Tal'Dorei.

1873
01:20:10.464 --> 01:20:13.005
"And I would like to be notified

1874
01:20:13.005 --> 01:20:14.271
"as to why I have been summoned.

1875
01:20:14.271 --> 01:20:16.718
"I take it you're Wensforth," and points to the goblin.

1876
01:20:16.718 --> 01:20:18.739
Goblin goes, "Yeah, I am Wensforth,

1877
01:20:18.739 --> 01:20:20.871
"you're the ally, I suppose?"

1878
01:20:20.871 --> 01:20:23.708
(as Allura) "I am, in some ways, yes."

1879
01:20:23.708 --> 01:20:27.730
TALIESIN: Well, it's concerning
actually something that we gave him

1880
01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:28.998
that's a bit of a conundrum.

1881
01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:31.478
LAURA: That he really wanted.

1882
01:20:31.478 --> 01:20:33.663
LIAM: Perhaps the explanation should

1883
01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:35.823
precede introductions, I'm so sorry.

1884
01:20:35.823 --> 01:20:39.029
This device here, this sphere--

1885
01:20:39.029 --> 01:20:41.316
LAURA: It's called the Happy Fun Ball.

1886
01:20:41.316 --> 01:20:44.102
LIAM: That's a nickname, we don't exactly

1887
01:20:44.102 --> 01:20:46.539
know what it's called, but

1888
01:20:46.539 --> 01:20:49.539
your friend, I assume, is within it.

1889
01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.477
It is in another plane,

1890
01:20:53.534 --> 01:20:58.534
and plays with the passage of time and is expansive.

1891
01:20:58.924 --> 01:21:00.718
TALIESIN: Once had a dragon.
LIAM: It is very old.

1892
01:21:00.718 --> 01:21:03.367
LAURA: Yes, it's got a library and lots of things.

1893
01:21:03.367 --> 01:21:04.524
SAM: And a dragon!

1894
01:21:04.524 --> 01:21:05.822
LAURA: There was a dragon, we killed it.

1895
01:21:05.822 --> 01:21:07.351
SAM: Oh, hi!

1896
01:21:07.351 --> 01:21:08.868
Sorry.

1897
01:21:08.868 --> 01:21:09.701
MATT: "Hello."

1898
01:21:09.701 --> 01:21:12.255
LAURA: That's Nott.
MATT: "Nott."

1899
01:21:12.255 --> 01:21:13.892
LAURA: I'm Jester.

1900
01:21:13.892 --> 01:21:15.875
TALIESIN: Caduceus, hi.

1901
01:21:15.875 --> 01:21:18.114
LIAM: My name is Caleb Widogast.

1902
01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:19.864
MARISHA: Beauregard.
TRAVIS: Fjord.

1903
01:21:20.912 --> 01:21:24.638
MATT: "There we go, now we're on a first name basis.

1904
01:21:24.638 --> 01:21:27.191
"So, this is the device you speak of?"

1905
01:21:27.191 --> 01:21:28.750
She leans forward on the table

1906
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.909
and moves some of the things aside, inspects it.

1907
01:21:30.909 --> 01:21:32.612
Reaches into the satchel off the side of the dress,

1908
01:21:32.612 --> 01:21:34.578
opens it, pulls out a component pouch,

1909
01:21:34.578 --> 01:21:36.409
begins to take a few elements out of it

1910
01:21:36.409 --> 01:21:38.897
scatter it around.

1911
01:21:38.897 --> 01:21:42.432
You can see what looks like a diamond dust-type

1912
01:21:42.432 --> 01:21:45.325
glitter beneath the overhead light of the orb

1913
01:21:45.325 --> 01:21:47.302
and she begins to swirl her hand around it.

1914
01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.332
The dust kicks up in this invisible wind.

1915
01:21:49.332 --> 01:21:51.870
and begins to cycle around the orb.

1916
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:55.140
As it does, her eyes glow a bright blue color.

1917
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.534
And then all at once, they (whooshes) drop to the ground,

1918
01:21:57.534 --> 01:22:00.100
and she goes, "(clears throat)

1919
01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.827
"The Heirloom Sphere."

1920
01:22:01.827 --> 01:22:02.946
LAURA: What?

1921
01:22:02.946 --> 01:22:04.901
MATT: That is the--"
SAM: No, the Happy Fun Ball.

1922
01:22:04.901 --> 01:22:08.728
MATT: "The official name of the object: The Heirloom Sphere.

1923
01:22:08.728 --> 01:22:11.240
"It is the key to the Folding Halls of Halas.

1924
01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.713
"It is also known as the Archmage Bane.

1925
01:22:13.713 --> 01:22:17.130
"It's in the damned name, Yussa, you fool.

1926
01:22:18.372 --> 01:22:21.711
"Well, notes, notes! There should be

1927
01:22:21.711 --> 01:22:23.028
"notes around here, I assume."

1928
01:22:23.028 --> 01:22:24.427
She starts looking through papers.

1929
01:22:24.427 --> 01:22:25.574
LAURA: I go looking through papers, too!

1930
01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:26.972
SAM: I'm going to look through papers!

1931
01:22:26.972 --> 01:22:29.297
MATT: All right, make an investigation check, you two.

1932
01:22:29.297 --> 01:22:30.567
TRAVIS: Can we tell you,

1933
01:22:30.567 --> 01:22:32.184
we've been inside this device.

1934
01:22:32.184 --> 01:22:35.737
LAURA: Oh, I held good Guidance-- too late.

1935
01:22:35.737 --> 01:22:36.622
MATT: Too late.

1936
01:22:36.622 --> 01:22:37.635
SAM: 15.

1937
01:22:37.635 --> 01:22:38.468
LAURA: Six!

1938
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:41.807
MATT: "Well, you've already been within

1939
01:22:41.807 --> 01:22:43.314
"the device and returned?"

1940
01:22:43.314 --> 01:22:46.029
TRAVIS: Yes, we were gone for about five days out here,

1941
01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:47.818
but in there it was much shorter.

1942
01:22:47.818 --> 01:22:49.086
LAURA: Like an hour or two.

1943
01:22:49.086 --> 01:22:52.447
TRAVIS: There was a chamber and then a library.

1944
01:22:52.447 --> 01:22:53.619
LAURA: And then you touched the thing

1945
01:22:53.619 --> 01:22:54.739
and we got sucked into

1946
01:22:54.739 --> 01:22:56.087
a dragon thing, and

1947
01:22:56.087 --> 01:22:57.728
then we almost got killed.
SAM: Small dragon.

1948
01:22:57.728 --> 01:22:59.038
MATT: "Small dragon?"

1949
01:22:59.038 --> 01:23:01.281
LAURA: A blue one.
MATT: "And you survived this?"

1950
01:23:01.281 --> 01:23:02.945
TRAVIS: We did.

1951
01:23:02.945 --> 01:23:04.871
I believe it was vanquished, but we also only saw--

1952
01:23:04.871 --> 01:23:07.136
LAURA: Almost kind of super close.

1953
01:23:07.136 --> 01:23:09.132
TRAVIS: -- a portion of this device.

1954
01:23:09.132 --> 01:23:11.243
LIAM: We got the sense that the creator of this thing

1955
01:23:11.243 --> 01:23:15.481
is, was, is/was somewhat paranoid.

1956
01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:18.657
MATT: "You could say that, yes. A very, very powerful

1957
01:23:18.657 --> 01:23:19.790
"archmage of old."

1958
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:22.170
MARISHA: Is Hamas the name of the guy who made it?

1959
01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:23.255
MATT: Halas.

1960
01:23:23.255 --> 01:23:25.588
MARISHA: Halas, the guy that, yeah.

1961
01:23:30.483 --> 01:23:32.701
MATT: "You see, the dangers of such pursuits

1962
01:23:32.701 --> 01:23:35.626
"as this device is that they require solitary efforts.

1963
01:23:35.626 --> 01:23:39.266
"Archmages do not usually work with others,

1964
01:23:39.266 --> 01:23:41.590
"as the result of covetous interest in such a device

1965
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:43.673
"and the secrets it holds.

01:23:44.548 --> 01:23:46.518

"would kill for this key?"

1968
01:23:48.299 --> 01:23:49.132
TRAVIS: No.

1969
01:23:49.132 --> 01:23:50.809
LAURA: I don't even know how many there are.

1970
01:23:50.809 --> 01:23:52.216
MATT: "There are quite a few."

1971
01:23:52.216 --> 01:23:53.818
LAURA: Are you an archmage?

1972
01:23:53.818 --> 01:23:55.715
MATT: "More or less, yes.

1973
01:23:55.715 --> 01:23:59.215
"I belong to a circle of mages known as the

1974

"Arcana Pansophical, we look to keep order in things.

01:24:11.825 --> 01:24:14.391
"moral interests."

1977
01:24:14.391 --> 01:24:17.329
LIAM: Have I heard about or read about the Pansophical?

1978
01:24:17.329 --> 01:24:18.976
MATT: Make a history check.

1979
01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:19.882
TALIESIN: I have something I've always

1980
01:24:19.882 --> 01:24:22.799
wanted to ask, if that's all right.

1981
01:24:23.713 --> 01:24:26.708
Are you a good archmage or a bad archmage?

1982
01:24:26.708 --> 01:24:28.791
MATT: (laughs)

1983
01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:31.855
"That's a very deep question.

1984
01:24:31.855 --> 01:24:33.767
"I would like to think a good archmage."

1985
01:24:33.767 --> 01:24:35.277
TALIESIN: Insight check just for that.

1986
01:24:35.277 --> 01:24:36.559
MATT: Make an insight check.

1987
01:24:36.559 --> 01:24:38.279
TRAVIS: Yeah, you insight check Allura.

1988
01:24:38.279 --> 01:24:39.258
TALIESIN: 21.

1989
01:24:39.258 --> 01:24:41.744
(chair scraping the floor)
(laughter)

1990
01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:43.619
TALIESIN: I mean, I don't need it.
I just really wanted to do it.

1991
01:24:43.619 --> 01:24:47.143
TRAVIS: He's whispering,
"Don't insight check Allura, motherfucker."

1992
01:24:47.143 --> 01:24:49.860
SAM: Turns out Allura was evil this whole time

1993
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.956
and has been playing the long game.
LIAM: She cuts off Caduceus' hand and says,

1994
01:24:51.956 --> 01:24:54.093
"It's just business." (explosion)

1995
01:24:54.093 --> 01:24:57.210
(laughter)

1996
01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:00.595
TALIESIN: Thank you, good insight check, thank you.

1997
01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:01.595
MATT: Of course.

1998
01:25:03.675 --> 01:25:04.508
TALIESIN: Oh man.

1999
01:25:07.132 --> 01:25:11.941
MATT: "Well, if anything, the knowledge that he entrusted me

2000
01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:15.171
"as the ally for his excursion and apparently you

2001
01:25:15.171 --> 01:25:18.254
"is comforting in some way, I suppose."

2002
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:23.959
TALIESIN: Now is as good a time as any to

2003
01:25:23.959 --> 01:25:26.868
practice a little bit of radical honesty.

2004
01:25:26.868 --> 01:25:27.958
He was not aware

2005
01:25:27.958 --> 01:25:29.934
that we were coming, but we've--

2006
01:25:29.934 --> 01:25:31.539
LAURA: We did give him the ball, though.

2007
01:25:31.539 --> 01:25:33.428
TALIESIN: And we did entrust him with it, so.

2008
01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:35.624
MATT: "That's good."
TALIESIN: We're here to help.

2009
01:25:35.624 --> 01:25:37.435
MATT: "Of all the multitude of individuals

2010

"you could have entrusted it to,

"you have made one of the better choices."

TALIESIN: (relieved sigh)

2013
01:25:42.368 --> 01:25:43.499
SAM: Can you extract him from this ball,

2014
01:25:43.499 --> 01:25:45.369
or do we need to go in and fetch?

2015
01:25:45.369 --> 01:25:47.922
MATT: "I-- give me a moment."

2016
01:25:47.922 --> 01:25:49.671
And she pores through some of the--

2017
01:25:49.671 --> 01:25:50.691
What did you roll for a history check?

2018
01:25:50.691 --> 01:25:54.242
LIAM: So low, I rolled a three, a 13.

2019
01:25:54.242 --> 01:25:58.118
MATT: You've maybe had passing mention in your reading,

2020
01:25:58.118 --> 01:25:59.756
but you don't remember or recall

2021
01:25:59.756 --> 01:26:02.560
any specific information about it.

2022
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.062
And what did you roll for your investigation checks?

2023
01:26:04.062 --> 01:26:06.173
SAM: 15.
MATT: 15, and...?

2024
01:26:06.173 --> 01:26:08.172
SAM: She rolled like six or something.

2025
01:26:08.172 --> 01:26:09.582
LAURA: I rolled six.

2026
01:26:09.582 --> 01:26:10.749
MATT: That's fine.

2027
01:26:15.157 --> 01:26:17.377
"I understand that, so you gave him this object.

01:26:19.572 --> 01:26:20.836
"What is your purpose in coming here, then?"

2030
01:26:20.836 --> 01:26:22.406
SAM: We work for ourselves.

2031
01:26:22.406 --> 01:26:24.477
TRAVIS: Loose allies, yes.

2032
01:26:24.477 --> 01:26:27.502
TALIESIN: We were actually here to hope to expand

2033
01:26:27.502 --> 01:26:30.362
that relationship, it's been a rough

2034
01:26:30.362 --> 01:26:32.678
it's been a rough couple...

2035
01:26:32.678 --> 01:26:34.493
MARISHA: We don't have many friends.

2036
01:26:34.493 --> 01:26:39.162
LIAM: To be honest, I think he saw, if I may be so bold,

2037
01:26:39.162 --> 01:26:41.079
a bit of promise in us.

2038
01:26:45.183 --> 01:26:48.182
MATT: "That is an extension of that comforting thought,

2039
01:26:48.182 --> 01:26:49.515
"isn't that, then?

2040
01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.969
"Now you've already been to this place once."

2041
01:26:52.969 --> 01:26:53.802
LAURA: Yeah.

2042
01:26:54.735 --> 01:26:56.459
SAM: We could guide you through it.

2043
01:26:56.459 --> 01:26:57.642
LAURA: Ish.

2044
01:26:57.642 --> 01:26:59.075
MATT: "You see, the thing, it's called

2045
01:26:59.075 --> 01:27:00.697
"the Archmage Bane for a reason."

2046
01:27:00.697 --> 01:27:01.530
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2047
01:27:02.743 --> 01:27:05.146
MATT: "The entities that would be covetous of such a device

2048
01:27:05.146 --> 01:27:07.105
"and the secrets that it holds would be those of

2049
01:27:07.105 --> 01:27:09.673
"my particular skill set.

2050
01:27:09.673 --> 01:27:12.623
"Assuredly, there are many defenses within

2051
01:27:12.623 --> 01:27:15.709
"that are designed specifically to keep

2052
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:18.826
"individuals like me and Yussa from reaching these secrets.

2053
01:27:18.826 --> 01:27:22.727
"Which I assume is what has befallen him,

2054
01:27:22.727 --> 01:27:25.580
"and hopefully not to a serious degree.

2055
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.540
"I think I would be less of a boon

2056
01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.681
"and more of a burden if I were to accompany you."

2057
01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:34.686
LIAM: Was he reckless to go in, then?

2058
01:27:34.686 --> 01:27:36.262
If you are so wary.

2059
01:27:36.262 --> 01:27:39.753
MATT: "Yes, I would say so." (chuckles nervously)

2060
01:27:39.753 --> 01:27:44.620
"But you know, some folks can't help themselves when

2061
01:27:46.476 --> 01:27:48.255
"the shiny red button is before them."

2062
01:27:48.255 --> 01:27:49.956
LAURA: Shiny red button! That's what you pushed.

2063
01:27:49.956 --> 01:27:52.017
TRAVIS: I pushed a shiny red button.

2064
01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:53.945
MATT: "Don't do that again, please."
TRAVIS: I won't.

2065
01:27:53.945 --> 01:27:54.997
We're more than happy to go in

2066
01:27:54.997 --> 01:27:56.580
and try and retrieve your friend,

2067
01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:58.461
if you'll put in a good word for us.
MATT: "I have--"

2068
01:27:58.461 --> 01:28:01.431
She reaches into the satchel and pulls out

2069
01:28:01.431 --> 01:28:04.055
a hand mirror of some kind.

2070
01:28:04.055 --> 01:28:06.387
It looks too wide to have fit into this satchel.

2071
01:28:06.387 --> 01:28:10.606
She pulls it out. It's silver outside.

2072
01:28:10.606 --> 01:28:12.845
"Here, take this with you.

2073
01:28:12.845 --> 01:28:15.254
"It should allow us some brief

2074
01:28:15.254 --> 01:28:18.141
"communication across the planes.

2075
01:28:18.141 --> 01:28:19.539
"Only a few times a day for about ten minutes,

2076
01:28:19.539 --> 01:28:21.954
"so be mindful of it."

2077
01:28:21.954 --> 01:28:23.440
LAURA: I didn't realize my hair looked like this,

2078
01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.305
we've been through some shit.

2079
01:28:25.305 --> 01:28:26.305
TALIESIN: I like it.

2080
01:28:27.533 --> 01:28:29.078
MATT: As you're looking through, Nott, you do find

2081
01:28:29.078 --> 01:28:29.911
amongst the notes, this.

2082
01:28:29.911 --> 01:28:32.170
ALL: Ooh!

2083
01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:34.074
SAM: I think I found something over here!

2084
01:28:34.074 --> 01:28:35.644
TRAVIS: Do you need instructions on the mirror?

2085
01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.230
SAM: Oh, he's been doing some mapping

2086
01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.735
of the Happy Fun Ball realm.

2087
01:28:40.735 --> 01:28:43.300
LAURA: Wow, look at all this things!

2088
01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.989
SAM: A little disjointed, but there are definitely

2089
01:28:45.989 --> 01:28:48.107
chambers and connections between them.

2090
01:28:48.107 --> 01:28:49.954
LAURA: Wait, where did we go?

2091
01:28:49.954 --> 01:28:50.972
We went to the library.

2092
01:28:50.972 --> 01:28:52.838
TRAVIS: Can we give it to the Xerox machine over here?

2093
01:28:52.838 --> 01:28:54.813
SAM: Sure, sure, but we're going to keep it with us.

2094
01:28:54.813 --> 01:28:56.830
LAURA: There's a study, that's
where we popped into originally.

2095
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:58.908
That's why there's so many lines coming out of it.

2096
01:28:58.908 --> 01:29:01.326
SAM: From the study, there's the dragon guard exit.

2097
01:29:01.326 --> 01:29:02.318
LAURA: That's where we were.

2098
01:29:02.318 --> 01:29:04.160
SAM: So those are the places we've been.

2099
01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.625
LAURA: How do we know-- Allura?
SAM: Tapestry entrance.

2100
01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:08.101
Is that where we went in?

2101
01:29:08.101 --> 01:29:09.562
MATT: When you first arrived, there was a chamber

2102
01:29:09.562 --> 01:29:11.995
with four tapestries.
TRAVIS: Put that bitch on the table!

2103
01:29:11.995 --> 01:29:15.089
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.
SAM: Sorry, sorry.

2104
01:29:15.089 --> 01:29:17.587
LAURA: Wait, let's take a picture of it so that we can--

2105
01:29:17.587 --> 01:29:19.504
TRAVIS: Aww fuck.

2106
01:29:20.632 --> 01:29:22.022
MATT: You want to move it this way.

2107
01:29:22.022 --> 01:29:26.434
SAM and LAURA: (yelling)

2108
01:29:26.434 --> 01:29:27.915
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2109
01:29:27.915 --> 01:29:30.698
SAM: There's something called the Fleshmend Facility.

2110
01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:32.354
TRAVIS: Yussa's got a little bit of an artist in him!

2111
01:29:32.354 --> 01:29:34.097
MATT: Now, interesting point of order,

2112
01:29:34.097 --> 01:29:36.910
while this map is centered here, the paper,

2113
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:40.027
it seems a lot of this is unfinished

2114
01:29:40.027 --> 01:29:42.908
and even looking at this and looking at the notes,

2115
01:29:42.908 --> 01:29:46.989
Allura glances and she goes, "It's quite a few rooms,

2116
01:29:46.989 --> 01:29:51.322
"but that what I could glean from my arcane readings,

2117
01:29:52.827 --> 01:29:56.096
"this is maybe 20-25% of the entirety of the

2118
01:29:56.096 --> 01:29:57.868
"Folding Halls of Halas."

2119
01:29:57.868 --> 01:29:59.624
TRAVIS: These names are terrible.

2120
01:29:59.624 --> 01:30:00.997
SAM: I know, read some out, Travis.

2121
01:30:00.997 --> 01:30:04.156
TRAVIS: The Dreadnought, the Prison of Soot,

2122
01:30:04.156 --> 01:30:07.044
the Crystal Mines, the Diamond Entrance.

2123
01:30:07.044 --> 01:30:09.453
SAM: They're not all bad, there's the Guest Quarters.

2124
01:30:09.453 --> 01:30:10.566
LIAM: The Carving Farm.

2125
01:30:10.566 --> 01:30:11.848
SAM: Okay, that's not good.

2126
01:30:11.848 --> 01:30:14.390
MARISHA: The Experiment Chambers?

2127
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:17.761
SAM and LAURA: (squealing)

2128
01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:22.019
MARISHA: Well, if he's already mapped these places out--

2129
01:30:22.019 --> 01:30:25.427
LAURA: The Fleshmound Facility sounds pretty kinky.

2130
01:30:25.427 --> 01:30:26.610
MARISHA: If his goal is--

2131
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:28.966
SAM: There's one that's just called the Fuck Room.

2132
01:30:28.966 --> 01:30:32.086
(laughter)

2133
01:30:32.086 --> 01:30:36.475
SAM: It's crazy.
TRAVIS: Those ley lines, man.

2134
01:30:36.475 --> 01:30:38.910
Are there any instructions we need to know about the mirror

2135
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.048
when using it three times a day?

2136
01:30:41.048 --> 01:30:42.998
MATT: "Just go ahead and rub the surface of it

2137
01:30:42.998 --> 01:30:44.572
"and call out my name."

2138
01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:46.412
LAURA: So I shouldn't do that right now?

2139
01:30:46.412 --> 01:30:47.494
MATT: "I would not recommend it."

2140
01:30:47.494 --> 01:30:50.583
LIAM: Point of order, group, for every minute

2141
01:30:50.583 --> 01:30:52.453
that we spend debating what to do,

2142
01:30:52.453 --> 01:30:55.589
a vastly greater amount of time is passing.

2143
01:30:55.589 --> 01:30:57.218
TRAVIS: Very true.
LIAM: Anything we need to do here

2144
01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:58.884
now we need to decide and then go.

2145
01:30:58.884 --> 01:31:01.089
LAURA: Do we need anything for the inside?

2146
01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:03.203
MATT: "I don't know, I mean..."

2147
01:31:03.203 --> 01:31:05.496
TRAVIS: You don't happen to
have any health potions on you, right?

2148
01:31:05.496 --> 01:31:07.062
It did fuck us up just a fair bit.

2149
01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:09.938
MATT: "I keep one on me, and since I am staying here."

2150
01:31:09.938 --> 01:31:14.138
LIAM: Is there anything obvious on the walls?

2151
01:31:14.138 --> 01:31:15.815
TRAVIS: Yeah, item-wise.

2152
01:31:15.815 --> 01:31:17.947
LAURA: Or that says like where he would have

2153
01:31:17.947 --> 01:31:21.113
been going to next, where he's trying to get to.

2154
01:31:21.113 --> 01:31:22.018
MARISHA: I actually wouldn't mind doing

2155
01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:23.360
an investigation check, as well.

2156
01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.800
MATT: Make an investigation check against the notes.

2157
01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:27.300
LAURA: I'm going to Guide you!

2158
01:31:28.365 --> 01:31:30.632
LIAM: I'm going to search for useful or magic shit!

2159
01:31:30.632 --> 01:31:32.080
TALIESIN: I'll also put Guidance on you

2160
01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.680
if you're doing an investigation check.

2161
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.293
MARISHA: Roll good, roll good.
LIAM: Damn it!

2162
01:31:37.293 --> 01:31:39.574
MARISHA: Oh, is that a, that's a natural 20, right?

2163
01:31:39.574 --> 01:31:40.551
LIAM: Yep.

2164
01:31:43.042 --> 01:31:44.788
TRAVIS: Confirmed, natural 20.

2165
01:31:44.788 --> 01:31:46.152
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2166
01:31:46.152 --> 01:31:47.001
MATT: On that investigation check?

2167
01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:49.130
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm looking for secrets.

2168
01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:49.963
TRAVIS: Fucking wizard shit.

2169
01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:51.418
MATT: Allura produces these two potions.

2170
01:31:51.418 --> 01:31:54.264
(cheering)
SAM: Whoa, what the fuck is that?

2171
01:31:54.264 --> 01:31:55.514
Look at that!

2172
01:31:56.698 --> 01:31:59.204
TRAVIS: (glugging)

2173
01:31:59.204 --> 01:32:01.664
MATT: "Very thirsty half-orc.

2174
01:32:01.664 --> 01:32:02.664
"Very well."

2175
01:32:06.129 --> 01:32:09.174
LAURA: Whoa, that's beautiful, Matt.

2176
01:32:09.174 --> 01:32:12.477
TALIESIN: (vocalizing)

2177
01:32:12.477 --> 01:32:13.515
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we just haven't had one of those yet.

2178
01:32:13.515 --> 01:32:15.153
LIAM: Where's my basic potion?

2179
01:32:15.153 --> 01:32:17.276
LAURA: Oh, maybe this is it.
MARISHA: Secrets!

2180
01:32:17.276 --> 01:32:18.425
MATT: So you rolled a natural 20,

2181
01:32:18.425 --> 01:32:20.414
plus your investigation equals what?

2182
01:32:20.414 --> 01:32:24.131
MARISHA: Plus my investigation, plus the Guidance.

2183
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:26.779
31.

2184
01:32:26.779 --> 01:32:29.375
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Do that fucking shit.

2185
01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:31.184
MARISHA: Finally, my class!

2186
01:32:33.608 --> 01:32:36.358
MATT: Looking at the map, specifically,

2187
01:32:36.358 --> 01:32:39.181
a lot of the notes look like there's no ink on them.

2188
01:32:39.181 --> 01:32:41.900
You can see writings in the paper but

2189
01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.086
they're designed not to be followed by anyone else's eyes.

2190
01:32:45.086 --> 01:32:47.811
You see Allura's frustration going through them like,

2191
01:32:47.811 --> 01:32:51.952
"Well, he's being smart about it.

2192
01:32:51.952 --> 01:32:53.863
"Unfortunately, not leaving much of a paper trail."

2193
01:32:53.863 --> 01:32:55.924
You, looking over the map as you guys are poring over it

2194
01:32:55.924 --> 01:32:57.529
can see--
MARISHA: I'm really into paper trails.

2195
01:32:57.529 --> 01:33:00.019
MATT: There are areas in the map that the drawing,

2196
01:33:00.019 --> 01:33:02.242
and there's a lot of tapping around specific locations

2197
01:33:02.242 --> 01:33:05.931
where it looks like a lot of intent and thought,

2198
01:33:05.931 --> 01:33:08.726
you begin to see in your mind, like visualize him

2199
01:33:08.726 --> 01:33:10.756
thinking and making a lot of notes around

2200
01:33:10.756 --> 01:33:12.897
and focusing on certain areas of the map

2201
01:33:12.897 --> 01:33:14.386
and looking at the various quill marks

2202
01:33:14.386 --> 01:33:16.147
and the pressure put into the paper,

2203
01:33:16.147 --> 01:33:18.642
the ones that gain the most attention are

2204
01:33:18.642 --> 01:33:21.164
the Study,

2205
01:33:21.164 --> 01:33:22.972
the Arcane Armory,

2206
01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:25.419
and the Permaheart Chamber.

2207
01:33:25.419 --> 01:33:28.493
SAM: Study, Arcane what?

2208
01:33:28.493 --> 01:33:29.939
LAURA: The study...
TALIESIN: Arcane Armory.

2209
01:33:29.939 --> 01:33:32.585
LAURA: Arcane Armory and the Permaheart.

2210
01:33:32.585 --> 01:33:34.949
MATT: And because you rolled so high an investigation check,

2211
01:33:34.949 --> 01:33:36.222
MARISHA: Yes?

2212
01:33:36.222 --> 01:33:38.671
MATT: Your brain goes, Permaheart, Permaheart...

2213
01:33:38.671 --> 01:33:40.839
LAURA: Oh, there it is, it's the triangle up at the top.

2214
01:33:40.839 --> 01:33:42.645
MATT: Permaheart, Permaheart...

2215
01:33:42.645 --> 01:33:46.228
TALIESIN: Fastest way is from the tapestry.
SAM: But?

2216
01:33:47.944 --> 01:33:50.583
MATT: Something about the Laughing Hand.

2217
01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:53.108
LAURA: (gasps)

2218
01:33:53.108 --> 01:33:54.648
The heart!

2219
01:33:54.648 --> 01:33:56.348
TRAVIS: On another plane.
LAURA: I told you!

2220
01:33:56.348 --> 01:33:57.714
I fucking told you!

2221
01:33:57.714 --> 01:34:01.458
TRAVIS: You did, you said it all fucking weekend, I know.

2222
01:34:01.458 --> 01:34:02.745
MATT: That's what a natural 20 gets you.

2223
01:34:02.745 --> 01:34:04.018
TRAVIS: (screaming)

2224
01:34:04.018 --> 01:34:06.963
Fucking detective!
SAM: Break Marisha's bones!

2225
01:34:06.963 --> 01:34:08.596
MARISHA: Ah!

2226
01:34:08.596 --> 01:34:10.470
What if there's a heart on another--

2227
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:12.755
LAURA: Remember, the heart is on another fucking plane,

2228
01:34:12.755 --> 01:34:14.294
and I said what if it's in the Happy Fun Ball?

2229
01:34:14.294 --> 01:34:17.053
I said that a long time ago!

2230
01:34:17.053 --> 01:34:20.404
SAM: She is the best detective.
LAURA: I'm such a good detective!

2231
01:34:20.404 --> 01:34:21.474
SAM: Good job, Jester!

2232
01:34:21.474 --> 01:34:23.724
(laughter)

2233
01:34:25.589 --> 01:34:26.869
LAURA: (gasps)

2234
01:34:26.869 --> 01:34:29.018
MARISHA: Okay, okay.
LAURA: Oh my god.

2235
01:34:29.018 --> 01:34:30.760
TRAVIS: We might not be fucked. We might still have a chance

2236
01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.057
to get ahead of this.

2237
01:34:34.057 --> 01:34:37.480
SAM: I will say this, also:
there's only a few of these rooms

2238
01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.730
that don't connect to another room,

2239
01:34:39.730 --> 01:34:41.228
and the Permaheart is one of them.

2240
01:34:41.228 --> 01:34:42.136
TRAVIS: Just because it's on the map

2241
01:34:42.136 --> 01:34:43.653
doesn't mean it's going to work that way.

2242
01:34:43.653 --> 01:34:44.820
LAURA: That's true, that's true.

2243
01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:47.244
MARISHA: So the Permaheart is a room
and not a physical thing?

2244
01:34:47.244 --> 01:34:49.495
LAURA: If we get rid of the heart,

2245
01:34:49.495 --> 01:34:51.437
then that means he can be killed.

2246
01:34:51.437 --> 01:34:52.585
MATT: You can guys can look over the map closely,

2247
01:34:52.585 --> 01:34:54.829
if you want to now.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

2248
01:34:54.829 --> 01:34:57.289
LAURA: I'm looking at my picture.

2249
01:34:57.289 --> 01:34:59.103
LIAM: I rolled 13 looking for magic bullshit.

2250
01:34:59.103 --> 01:34:59.936
MATT: For which one?

2251
01:34:59.936 --> 01:35:02.447
LIAM: 15, oh looking for magic anything, items.

2252
01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:04.989
MARISHA: The Experiment Chambers...

2253
01:35:04.989 --> 01:35:08.809
TALIESIN: Diamond, the Garden,
Tower Machine, the Golem Workshop.

2254
01:35:08.809 --> 01:35:10.025
MARISHA: So we came in--

2255
01:35:10.025 --> 01:35:11.390
MATT: This is just an arcana check you're doing?

2256
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:13.167
LIAM: I wanted to see if he had wands,

2257
01:35:13.167 --> 01:35:16.120
spells, anything that would be useful.

2258
01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.140
MARISHA: The Tapestry Entrance is where we came last time.
LIAM: I'll take his shit to save him.

2259
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:18.973
MATT: I understand.

2260
01:35:18.973 --> 01:35:21.011
LAURA: I'm sending you guys a picture of the map.

2261
01:35:21.011 --> 01:35:22.649
MATT: Looking through this chamber,

2262
01:35:22.649 --> 01:35:27.092
with a 15, you do see behind one of the glass

2263
01:35:27.092 --> 01:35:28.679
elements of the case there,

2264
01:35:28.679 --> 01:35:33.179
there is a vial of liquid that catches your attention.

2265
01:35:34.177 --> 01:35:36.576
Amongst a bunch of other empty glass vials,

2266
01:35:36.576 --> 01:35:38.619
but one of them is still full.

2267
01:35:38.619 --> 01:35:40.427
And--
LAURA: Oh my god.

2268
01:35:40.427 --> 01:35:42.826
TRAVIS: That doesn't mean that's where he is, though.

2269
01:35:42.826 --> 01:35:44.459
SAM: Yeah, that's true.
TALIESIN: But if he were--

2270
01:35:44.459 --> 01:35:45.892
LAURA: What if he's like, oh my god.

2271
01:35:45.892 --> 01:35:47.219
MARISHA: What if he's a part of this?!

2272
01:35:47.219 --> 01:35:49.266
What if he is a part of this?

2273
01:35:49.266 --> 01:35:50.634
MATT: And that's it.

2274
01:35:50.634 --> 01:35:52.324
LAURA: What if Hala is a part of it?

2275
01:35:52.324 --> 01:35:54.888
What if he, because it's his place to begin with?

2276
01:35:54.888 --> 01:35:56.144
SAM: Halas?

2277
01:35:56.144 --> 01:35:57.327
LAURA: Yeah, not holla.

2278
01:35:57.327 --> 01:35:58.536
Holla!

2279
01:35:58.536 --> 01:36:00.998
LIAM: Matt, is it "Halás" or "Hálas"? I can't remember.

2280
01:36:00.998 --> 01:36:03.663
MATT: Halás is how I have...
LIAM: Halás.

2281
01:36:03.663 --> 01:36:05.468
SAM: Is there a room on the map that says

2282
01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:07.068
Vox Machina crossover room?

2283
01:36:07.068 --> 01:36:09.318
(laughter)

2284
01:36:10.241 --> 01:36:12.270
TRAVIS: No.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, though.

2285
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:13.103
Okay.

2286
01:36:14.711 --> 01:36:17.300
Can I do another room sweep

2287
01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:20.340
and see if I see anything about the Angel of Irons,

2288
01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.757
does it look like

2289
01:36:22.947 --> 01:36:26.277
Yussa's getting into some cult shit?

2290
01:36:26.277 --> 01:36:28.357
SAM: We can ask him when we find him!

2291
01:36:28.357 --> 01:36:29.656
LAURA: Time is passing!

2292
01:36:29.656 --> 01:36:30.893
He's trapped in there.

2293
01:36:30.893 --> 01:36:31.989
LIAM: Four days have already gone by

2294
01:36:31.989 --> 01:36:33.406
since I said we have to leave.

2295
01:36:33.406 --> 01:36:34.812
We should go.
TALIESIN: Let's go, let's go in.

2296
01:36:34.812 --> 01:36:36.508
SAM: He's not going to spend all of those four days

2297
01:36:36.508 --> 01:36:38.869
in the Fuck Room, either.

2298
01:36:38.869 --> 01:36:40.509
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, we have to figure out

2299
01:36:40.509 --> 01:36:42.316
where we're going, we don't want to just

2300
01:36:42.316 --> 01:36:44.228
dive in without a plan.

2301
01:36:44.228 --> 01:36:45.538
TRAVIS: It depends on where we go in.

2302
01:36:45.538 --> 01:36:47.985
I would also note that place is bad.

2303
01:36:47.985 --> 01:36:50.443
LAURA: Isn't that the reverse, Caleb?

2304
01:36:50.443 --> 01:36:52.728
Wouldn't it be only like a little bit of time

2305
01:36:52.728 --> 01:36:54.259
has passed in there?

2306
01:36:54.259 --> 01:36:55.314
TALIESIN: No, a lot of--

2307
01:36:55.314 --> 01:36:56.890
LAURA: Because seven days had passed out here,

2308
01:36:56.890 --> 01:36:57.844
five days had passed out here

2309
01:36:57.844 --> 01:36:59.182
and only like two hours in there.

2310
01:36:59.182 --> 01:37:00.732
LIAM: No, we were not in there that long

2311
01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:02.590
and people on the outside were like, "where are they?

2312
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:03.665
"They're gone."
MATT: Correct,

2313
01:37:03.665 --> 01:37:05.589
but you're not in the Fun Ball for the time being.

2314
01:37:05.589 --> 01:37:06.880
LAURA: I understand, okay, okay.

2315
01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.420
MATT: So actually, Jester is correct.

2316
01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:10.773
LIAM: The quick is inside, the slow is outside, isn't it?

2317
01:37:10.773 --> 01:37:13.034
MATT: Correct, so right now, you guys taking an hour here

2318
01:37:13.034 --> 01:37:15.579
would take a few minutes there, maybe.

2319
01:37:15.579 --> 01:37:18.091
You don't have the exact exchange rate of time,

2320
01:37:18.091 --> 01:37:19.739
and you don't even know if it's constant.

2321
01:37:19.739 --> 01:37:21.307
TALIESIN: There's a couple different options.

2322
01:37:21.307 --> 01:37:23.530
But we can either go to the dining hall or the study.

2323
01:37:23.530 --> 01:37:25.102
We've been to the study, but the dining hall

2324
01:37:25.102 --> 01:37:27.331
then leads to guest quarters--

2325
01:37:27.331 --> 01:37:28.700
LAURA: But we have to pop in to the study

2326
01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:29.977
to get to anything else.

2327
01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:31.114
SAM: We don't know where we'll pop in,

2328
01:37:31.114 --> 01:37:32.653
press that fucking button!

2329
01:37:32.653 --> 01:37:35.062
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't have control.

2330
01:37:35.062 --> 01:37:37.514
TRAVIS: Let's go. I mean, I'm good at a few things,

2331
01:37:37.514 --> 01:37:41.755
pushing shit that gets us in trouble is one of them.

2332
01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.557
MATT: As you guys are scattering around,

2333
01:37:43.557 --> 01:37:45.612
Allura's looking at the orb and inspecting it,

2334
01:37:45.612 --> 01:37:48.557
you can see beads of sweat, she's like,

2335
01:37:48.557 --> 01:37:50.245
(sighs)

2336
01:37:50.245 --> 01:37:51.886
"It's rare that you look right into the face

2337
01:37:51.886 --> 01:37:55.415
"of something designed to destroy you.

2338
01:37:55.415 --> 01:37:57.691
"He's braver than I. You're braver than I."

2339
01:37:57.691 --> 01:37:59.982
LAURA: Oh no.
TALIESIN: Oh no, definitely not.

2340
01:37:59.982 --> 01:38:01.855
TRAVIS: Blissfully ignorant.
LAURA: We're just stupid.

2341
01:38:01.855 --> 01:38:04.966
MATT: "Stupid's fine, I've been there myself."

2342
01:38:04.966 --> 01:38:07.024
SAM: They call me brave.

2343
01:38:07.024 --> 01:38:09.504
MATT: "I'm sure you are."

2344
01:38:09.504 --> 01:38:11.739
MARISHA: Okay, well.

2345
01:38:11.739 --> 01:38:15.128
For quick context, there's a big demon

2346
01:38:15.128 --> 01:38:17.572
that's been unleashed called the Laughing Hand,

2347
01:38:17.572 --> 01:38:20.437
this monster by this demon named Obann

2348
01:38:20.437 --> 01:38:23.690
on all part of this cult called the Angel of Irons,

2349
01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:25.886
and somehow we think that this might loop into it,

2350
01:38:25.886 --> 01:38:29.658
but we're not totally sure, so we're going to go now.

2351
01:38:29.658 --> 01:38:32.366
You have a look of recognition in your face?

2352
01:38:32.366 --> 01:38:35.199
MATT: "No, I don't know what that is.

2353
01:38:36.125 --> 01:38:37.715
"We'll talk when you return."

2354
01:38:37.715 --> 01:38:39.787
LAURA: But what if we don't return?

2355
01:38:39.787 --> 01:38:42.651
Let people know, okay?
MATT: "Then I will pass that on."

2356
01:38:42.651 --> 01:38:44.606
SAM: We're dealing with otherworldly threats.

2357
01:38:44.606 --> 01:38:46.787
TRAVIS: (beeping)

2358
01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:47.687
SAM: Okay, bye.
LIAM: It's not a button,

2359
01:38:47.687 --> 01:38:48.789
it's like a Rubik's Cube

2360
01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:50.841
that needs to be--
TRAVIS: I still touch it.

2361
01:38:50.841 --> 01:38:53.294
MATT: Who wants to attempt to try and figure out--

2362
01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:55.181
MARISHA: You did it last time, right?

2363
01:38:55.181 --> 01:38:58.060
MATT: You go up and walk to it and you remember.

2364
01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:00.328
Looking at the device and remember what it looked like

2365
01:39:00.328 --> 01:39:02.552
and glancing at it now, its arrangement

2366
01:39:02.552 --> 01:39:05.512
from last time you saw it is entirely different.

2367
01:39:05.512 --> 01:39:08.566
It seems to continuously reconfigure its outer shell

2368
01:39:08.566 --> 01:39:11.342
with each successful entry.

2369
01:39:11.342 --> 01:39:14.735
LAURA: Maybe, Allura, would you know, okay, maybe Caleb.

2370
01:39:14.735 --> 01:39:15.967
SAM: We can do this.

2371
01:39:15.967 --> 01:39:18.121
Caleb's the smartest.
SAM: You're pretty smart.

2372
01:39:18.121 --> 01:39:21.079
LIAM: I'm good with mechanical devices and

2373
01:39:21.079 --> 01:39:23.313
mathematics and such.

2374
01:39:23.313 --> 01:39:25.043
But a little assist would be.
TALIESIN: You got it.

2375
01:39:25.043 --> 01:39:28.724
LAURA: Oh yeah, here's some Guidance, just for you.

2376
01:39:28.724 --> 01:39:32.117
MATT: Allura holds onto the hand mirror off the side

2377
01:39:32.117 --> 01:39:35.063
and steps back towards the entrance of the chamber.

2378
01:39:35.063 --> 01:39:39.396
"I'll watch from over here, just being careful."

2379
01:39:39.396 --> 01:39:41.043
She steps back onto the landing

2380
01:39:41.043 --> 01:39:44.809
and is still watching through the doorway, but just like--

2381
01:39:44.809 --> 01:39:46.400
Make an investigation check.

2382
01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.862
LIAM: Okay, so I sit down in front of it and

2383
01:39:47.862 --> 01:39:50.417
send Caleb to sit on Allura's feet.

2384
01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.753
MATT: Send Caleb?
LIAM: Yes, Caleb, exactly.

2385
01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:54.908
Frumpkin, I'm stressed out by the ball!

2386
01:39:54.908 --> 01:39:56.433
I send Frumpkin over to sit--

2387
01:39:56.433 --> 01:39:58.194
but it'd be cool if Caleb sat on her feet, though.

2388
01:39:58.194 --> 01:39:59.891
(laughter)

2389
01:39:59.891 --> 01:40:02.455
MATT: "Strange."

2390
01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:04.725
LIAM: (purrs)

2391
01:40:04.725 --> 01:40:07.998
Okay, so with Guidance, come on.

2392
01:40:07.998 --> 01:40:09.068
All right, that's good.

2393
01:40:09.068 --> 01:40:11.290
And the Guidance.
TRAVIS: Here we go.

2394
01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:12.570
Here we go!

2395
01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:13.403
LIAM: 26.

2396
01:40:14.512 --> 01:40:15.570
MATT: 26.

2397
01:40:16.793 --> 01:40:19.252
Yeah, okay.

2398
01:40:19.252 --> 01:40:22.085
You find one of the central bands,

2399
01:40:23.327 --> 01:40:25.538
there's a false band that actually splits.

2400
01:40:25.538 --> 01:40:27.963
You go to rotate it and instead it splits partway open.

2401
01:40:27.963 --> 01:40:31.560
At that point, there's a small little section

2402
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.081
where a button press, you click with your finger.

2403
01:40:34.081 --> 01:40:36.562
As you do it, whirs open slightly,

2404
01:40:36.562 --> 01:40:38.673
almost going to an ovoid shape.

2405
01:40:38.673 --> 01:40:39.985
The whole thing reconfigures

2406
01:40:39.985 --> 01:40:41.094
and you're like, "That's strange."

2407
01:40:41.094 --> 01:40:42.635
Looking on the opposite end, you can see

2408
01:40:42.635 --> 01:40:46.023
there's a slight bit of exposed greenish crystal now.

2409
01:40:46.023 --> 01:40:47.640
As you take that and begin to turn it,

2410
01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.546
(clicking)

2411
01:40:49.546 --> 01:40:51.823
(whooshes) The whole thing adjusts and as it does,

2412
01:40:51.823 --> 01:40:54.095
bright blue light begins to (whirring)

2413
01:40:54.095 --> 01:40:57.514
appear from within all the various nooks and crannies.

2414
01:40:57.514 --> 01:41:01.564
It fills the chamber with a flash.

2415
01:41:01.564 --> 01:41:02.841
And that's where we're going to take a break.

2416
01:41:02.841 --> 01:41:06.525
(yelling)

2417
01:41:06.525 --> 01:41:08.652
MARISHA: Okay, wait, wait, okay.

2418
01:41:08.652 --> 01:41:09.985
TRAVIS: She's back!

2419
01:41:11.036 --> 01:41:12.546
LIAM: My heart is so full!

2420
01:41:12.546 --> 01:41:15.493
LAURA: I'm so happy!
(clapping)

2421
01:41:15.493 --> 01:41:16.576
MARISHA: Thank fuck.

2422
01:41:17.545 --> 01:41:19.171
TRAVIS: Sorry!

2423
01:41:19.171 --> 01:41:21.489
LIAM: I know it's meta, but that is such a point of favor

2424
01:41:21.489 --> 01:41:23.551
for Yussa that he is friends with her.

2425
01:41:23.551 --> 01:41:24.551
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

2426
01:41:26.285 --> 01:41:30.832
MATT: As a note, this is your
Mirror of Infinite Transpondence.

2427
01:41:30.832 --> 01:41:33.121
Granted by her.
TRAVIS: It can break, right?

2428
01:41:33.121 --> 01:41:35.529
MATT: It possibly can break, and it seems like it's only

2429
01:41:35.529 --> 01:41:39.007
three uses within a period of a day cycle.

2430
01:41:39.007 --> 01:41:41.116
TALIESIN: God only knows what a day means in this other--

2431
01:41:41.116 --> 01:41:42.714
LAURA: That's amazing!
TRAVIS: Ten minutes of usage?

2432
01:41:42.714 --> 01:41:43.633
MATT: Yeah, per use.

2433
01:41:43.633 --> 01:41:46.862
LAURA: We can do it three times a day?

2434
01:41:46.862 --> 01:41:48.271
SAM: Wow!
LAURA: That's amazing.

2435
01:41:48.271 --> 01:41:49.529
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Going on a break.

2436
01:41:49.529 --> 01:41:51.062
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, break.

2437
01:41:51.062 --> 01:41:51.895
Is there a contest?

2438
01:41:51.895 --> 01:41:53.096
MATT: We're going to go to break.
We'll be back here shortly.

2439
01:41:53.096 --> 01:41:57.754
We do have our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway!

2440
01:41:58.706 --> 01:42:00.315
So we have the new Hero Vault

2441
01:42:00.315 --> 01:42:01.396
from our friends at Wyrmwood.

2442
01:42:01.396 --> 01:42:02.798
The Kickstarter has ended but they are now

2443
01:42:02.798 --> 01:42:04.690
available for pre-order on Backer Kit

2444
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:06.186
if you didn't have the opportunity to do so.

2445
01:42:06.186 --> 01:42:08.687
Fantastic art on the cover from friend of the show

2446
01:42:08.687 --> 01:42:10.813
Deven Rue, it's amazing.

2447
01:42:10.813 --> 01:42:12.445
This one goes to a lucky winner

2448
01:42:12.445 --> 01:42:15.375
who gets chosen during the break.

2449
01:42:15.375 --> 01:42:17.302
The keyword tonight is "PATHS"

2450
01:42:17.302 --> 01:42:19.399
plural, P-A-T-H-S.

2451
01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:20.673
Put it in once, more than once and

2452
01:42:20.673 --> 01:42:21.723
you'll be disqualified and once again

2453
01:42:21.723 --> 01:42:22.935
only people in the US and Canada

2454
01:42:22.935 --> 01:42:24.905
excluding Quebec because of stupid laws.

2455
01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:26.836
We'll have a winner when we come back

2456
01:42:26.836 --> 01:42:28.190
from the break here shortly.

2457
01:42:28.190 --> 01:42:30.591
MARISHA: And enjoy Travis's Spooktacular!

2458
01:42:30.591 --> 01:42:32.398
MATT: Yes, enjoy!

2459
01:42:32.398 --> 01:42:34.215
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2460
01:42:34.215 --> 01:42:36.820
MARISHA: Yes, clowns.
TRAVIS: Yeah, scary clowns.

2461
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.302
MARISHA: Go ahead.
TRAVIS: Bye!

TRAVIS (V.O.): (as Reverend Mason) Our father,

2486
01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:35.002
we gather here

2487
01:43:35.002 --> 01:43:36.827
as strangers

2488
01:43:36.827 --> 01:43:39.083
brought together by gold

2489
01:43:39.083 --> 01:43:41.366
now bound by fate and fear.

2490
01:43:42.496 --> 01:43:46.001
We remain steadfast in our bodies

2491
01:43:46.001 --> 01:43:49.584
and in our minds, but this evil we face now

2492
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:52.303
meets us ill-prepared.

2493
01:43:54.176 --> 01:43:57.015
For guidance, we ask you now.

2494
01:43:57.015 --> 01:43:59.682 line:15%
For... protection,

01:44:00.524 --> 01:44:02.357 line:15%

2496

2505

01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:18.923
(screaming)

2507
01:45:18.923 --> 01:45:21.072
TRAVIS: What the fuck, what the fuck?!

2508
01:45:21.072 --> 01:45:25.270
TALIESIN: Welcome to Yee-Haw Spooky Ranch!

2509
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:26.886
BRIAN: Yee-Haw Spooky Ranch?

2510
01:45:26.886 --> 01:45:30.340
There's no way; we were just in Jungle Ranch.

2511
01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.852
TALIESIN: A friend of yours left a message, where is it?

2512
01:45:33.852 --> 01:45:37.640
Ah, yes (struggling grunts).

2513
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.172
BRIAN: Looks like a message.

2514
01:45:39.172 --> 01:45:40.952
TRAVIS: The dexterity on this fucking thing.

2515
01:45:40.952 --> 01:45:44.115
TALIESIN: "Dear Cardboard Face and Chosen One,"

2516
01:45:44.115 --> 01:45:45.305
BRIAN: Ah.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2517
01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:47.677
TALIESIN: "If you are receiving this message, it means

2518
01:45:47.677 --> 01:45:51.228
"that the Tome of Realm-portation was successful!" Mm!

2519
01:45:51.228 --> 01:45:53.290
BRIAN: Wait, you don't think it's,

2520
01:45:53.290 --> 01:45:55.282
you don't think it's Bast'Alar, do you?

2521
01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.529
You think he knows him?

2522
01:45:56.529 --> 01:45:58.367
TALIESIN: Did you say Bast'Alar?

2523
01:45:58.367 --> 01:45:59.449
TRAVIS: Well--

2524
01:45:59.449 --> 01:46:03.035
TALIESIN: Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

2525
01:46:03.035 --> 01:46:04.662
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!
BRIAN: What?!

2526
01:46:04.662 --> 01:46:05.775
You know Bast'Alar?

2527
01:46:05.775 --> 01:46:08.619
TALIESIN: Hah! Know him, well, not by that

2528
01:46:08.619 --> 01:46:11.453
stupid moniker he uses now.

2529
01:46:11.453 --> 01:46:14.998
I knew him ages ago, a simpler time.

2530
01:46:14.998 --> 01:46:18.378
When he was known as Mitten McFluffyFloof.

2531
01:46:18.378 --> 01:46:20.068
BRIAN: You're telling me that creature's name

2532
01:46:20.068 --> 01:46:23.193
was once Mittens McFluffyFloof?

2533
01:46:23.193 --> 01:46:24.706
TALIESIN: Are you really surprised?

2534
01:46:24.706 --> 01:46:28.793
He hasn't always been the Ascended One, or whatever.

2535
01:46:28.793 --> 01:46:30.175
BRIAN: Ascended One, how do you know him?

2536
01:46:30.175 --> 01:46:33.451
TALIESIN: A long time ago, before he rose to power--

2537
01:46:33.451 --> 01:46:34.342
TRAVIS: He's monologuing.

2538
01:46:34.342 --> 01:46:36.508
TALIESIN: We were just stray kittens

2539
01:46:36.508 --> 01:46:38.795
living on the streets of Neo-Gameland.

2540
01:46:38.795 --> 01:46:40.721
TRAVIS: Fucking where?
TALIESIN: When you live on the streets

2541
01:46:40.721 --> 01:46:43.505
in a place like that, you learn quickly

2542
01:46:43.505 --> 01:46:46.033
that you need companionship to survive.

2543
01:46:46.033 --> 01:46:48.021
TRAVIS: Oh, they were lovers.
TALIESIN: We hunted together,

2544
01:46:48.021 --> 01:46:51.599
ate together, and kept each other warm on cold nights.

2545
01:46:51.599 --> 01:46:52.724
TRAVIS: They're fucking.
BRIAN: -- warm.

2546
01:46:52.724 --> 01:46:56.459
TALIESIN: I always accepted my fate
of being abandoned on the streets,

2547
01:46:56.459 --> 01:46:59.177
but he could never come to terms with it.

2548
01:46:59.177 --> 01:47:03.004
That's a story for another time, Swamp Cooler Breath.

2549
01:47:03.004 --> 01:47:05.725
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2550
01:47:05.725 --> 01:47:08.862
TALIESIN: Now, it is time for you to charge our

2551
01:47:08.862 --> 01:47:12.244
Game Soul with your laughs and your screams!

2552
01:47:12.244 --> 01:47:15.231
(evil laughing)

2553
01:47:15.231 --> 01:47:18.878
(coughing)
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2554
01:47:18.878 --> 01:47:20.702
TALIESIN: Excuse me. (hacking)

2555
01:47:20.702 --> 01:47:22.397
BRIAN: Are you vaping, sir?

2556
01:47:22.397 --> 01:47:23.687
Is he gone?

2557
01:47:23.687 --> 01:47:25.312 line:15%
TRAVIS: Somebody wants to hit him with something long.

2558
01:47:25.312 --> 01:47:26.392 line:15%
BRIAN: Where is he?

2559
01:47:26.392 --> 01:47:28.551 line:15%
TRAVIS: There he is. That guy.
BRIAN: Oh, he just exploded

2560
01:47:28.551 --> 01:47:30.198 line:15%
all over my face.
TRAVIS: Yep, that one.

2561
01:47:30.198 --> 01:47:31.709 line:15%
Well, I don't think that's, again,

2562
01:47:31.709 --> 01:47:34.320 line:15%
the way we want to phrase it.
BRIAN: That's what happened.

2563
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.694 line:15%
Oh, what is this, is that cigarettes?

2564
01:47:36.694 --> 01:47:38.097 line:15%
TRAVIS: Don't open the door again!

2565
01:47:38.097 --> 01:47:40.808 line:15%
There, you got him.
BRIAN: Oh, it's ammo.

2566
01:47:40.808 --> 01:47:41.641 line:15%
Wow.

2567
01:47:42.563 --> 01:47:44.492 line:15%
Oh my god.
TRAVIS: Dude, the Spookyverse

2568
01:47:44.492 --> 01:47:47.592 line:15%
rains candy!
BRIAN: Dude, this place is amazing!

2569
01:47:47.592 --> 01:47:49.429
TRAVIS: This is the best thing ever!

2570
01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:50.839 line:15%
Big sound, ow.

2571
01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:52.501 line:15%
Big bear, big bear chase me!

2572
01:47:52.501 --> 01:47:54.198 line:15%
Big bear chase me.
BRIAN: I got him.

2573
01:47:54.198 --> 01:47:56.232 line:15%
(machine gun fires)

2574
01:47:56.232 --> 01:47:57.801 line:15%
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you're in trouble,

2575
01:47:57.801 --> 01:47:59.304 line:15%
here, I'm going to get over to you and--

2576
01:47:59.304 --> 01:48:00.630 line:15%
BRIAN: Where is he?
TRAVIS: I'm going to help you out.

2577
01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:02.072 line:15%
BRIAN: Let me at him!
TRAVIS: Help you up.

2578
01:48:02.072 --> 01:48:03.547 line:15%
(Brian yells)

2579
01:48:03.547 --> 01:48:05.106 line:15%
You're walking around with a doll!

2580
01:48:05.106 --> 01:48:06.719 line:15%
Do you know how fucked that is?

2581
01:48:06.719 --> 01:48:08.644 line:15%
BRIAN: I mean...
TRAVIS: If somebody sees us,

2582
01:48:08.644 --> 01:48:09.706 line:15%
they're going to shoot us.
BRIAN: It's not that far off

2583
01:48:09.706 --> 01:48:11.145 line:15%
from real life, but.
TRAVIS: Two people with

2584
01:48:11.145 --> 01:48:13.968 line:15%
white jumpsuits walking around with dolls?

2585
01:48:13.968 --> 01:48:15.422 line:15%
BRIAN: Creepy ain't a crime.

2586
01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.755 line:15%
(screaming)

2587
01:48:18.885 --> 01:48:20.663 line:15%
Was that mine or yours? You still have yours,

2588
01:48:20.663 --> 01:48:22.412 line:15%
do I still have mine?

2589
01:48:22.412 --> 01:48:23.953 line:15%
Whose was it?

2590
01:48:25.535 --> 01:48:26.831 line:15%
Can we go in there?

2591
01:48:26.831 --> 01:48:28.821 line:15%
I don't want to go in there, but can we?

2592
01:48:28.821 --> 01:48:30.618 line:15%
(Brian yells)
TRAVIS: I don't want to play anymore.

2593
01:48:30.618 --> 01:48:32.166 line:15%
Come here, you piece of shit!

2594
01:48:32.166 --> 01:48:37.166 line:15%
(screaming) I'm going to get you (more screaming)

2595
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:38.249 line:15%
BRIAN: Did you get it?

2596
01:48:38.249 --> 01:48:39.632 line:15%
TRAVIS: I got it.
BRIAN: How did you do it?

2597
01:48:39.632 --> 01:48:41.836 line:15%
TRAVIS: I ran.
BRIAN: You ran over it?

2598
01:48:41.836 --> 01:48:45.169 line:15%
(Brian whimpers loudly)

2599
01:48:48.517 --> 01:48:49.962 line:15%
We're good.

2600
01:48:49.962 --> 01:48:51.494 line:15%
TRAVIS: Are we supposed to be--
BRIAN: We're good, we're good

2601
01:48:51.494 --> 01:48:53.057 line:15%
we're good, ah, key (screams)!

2602
01:48:53.057 --> 01:48:54.571 line:15%
Fuck!
TRAVIS: Whoa, what the fuck is that?

2603
01:48:54.571 --> 01:48:57.755 line:15%
BRIAN: Fuck!
TRAVIS: No no no no no no no!

2604
01:48:57.755 --> 01:49:00.465 line:15%
BRIAN: I threw the doll at her and she took it!

2605
01:49:00.465 --> 01:49:01.382 line:15%
Fuck, shit!

2606
01:49:03.159 --> 01:49:05.159 line:15%
Oh fuck, dude dude dude.

2607
01:49:06.074 --> 01:49:07.593 line:15%
Is she dancing?

2608
01:49:07.593 --> 01:49:09.643 line:15%
TRAVIS: Stop looking at her, dude, stop looking at her.

2609
01:49:09.643 --> 01:49:12.948 line:15%
(roaring)
(screaming)

2610
01:49:12.948 --> 01:49:15.986 line:15%
BRIAN: Can I kill her with the pen, oh god, oh god.

2611
01:49:15.986 --> 01:49:17.328 line:15%
How do I run?

2612
01:49:17.328 --> 01:49:19.775 line:15%
Oh fuck me, dude, get me out of here.

2613
01:49:19.775 --> 01:49:20.817 line:15%
Get me out of here.

2614
01:49:20.817 --> 01:49:22.969 line:15%
Get me out of here, get me out of here, man.

2615
01:49:22.969 --> 01:49:25.302 line:15%
(screaming)

2616
01:49:26.854 --> 01:49:28.607 line:15%
TRAVIS: Nope, I'm not looking over there.

2617
01:49:28.607 --> 01:49:30.169 line:15%
Not looking over there.
BRIAN: Look, look, look!

2618
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:31.477 line:15%
TRAVIS: Nope, not doing it.

2619
01:49:31.477 --> 01:49:32.489 line:15%
(Brian screams)

2620
01:49:32.489 --> 01:49:34.049 line:15%
TRAVIS: I'm alive.

2621
01:49:34.049 --> 01:49:36.482 line:15%
BRIAN and TRAVIS: You are a doll?

2622
01:49:36.482 --> 01:49:38.493 line:15%
BRIAN: I'm a little doll now!

2623
01:49:38.493 --> 01:49:40.326 line:15%
TRAVIS: What is that?
BRIAN: Dude.

2624
01:49:42.924 --> 01:49:45.095 line:15%
TRAVIS: Is that you?
BRIAN: It's me!

2625
01:49:45.095 --> 01:49:46.062 line:15%
TRAVIS: Come here, can I pick you up,

2626
01:49:46.062 --> 01:49:48.057 line:15%
you little piece of shit?
(Brian yells gleefully)

2627
01:49:48.057 --> 01:49:50.834 line:15%
Little Toy Story motherfucker, come here!

2628
01:49:50.834 --> 01:49:53.888 line:15%
Come here, Woody!
BRIAN: You can't get me!

2629
01:49:53.888 --> 01:49:55.262 line:15%
I have wood!

2630
01:49:55.262 --> 01:49:57.636 line:15%
How do I use my wood, Jerry?

2631
01:49:57.636 --> 01:49:59.197 line:15%
TRAVIS: Can I take this rapier?
BRIAN: Whoa!

2632
01:49:59.197 --> 01:50:03.070 line:15%
Dude, watch, watch, look, I can jump super high.

2633
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:04.636 line:15%
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
BRIAN: Later!

2634
01:50:04.636 --> 01:50:05.591 line:15%
(laughter)

2635
01:50:05.591 --> 01:50:06.968 line:15%
TRAVIS: Oh!

2636
01:50:06.968 --> 01:50:08.218 line:15%
Oh no, oh no!

2637
01:50:09.318 --> 01:50:11.460 line:15%
Why am I walking so slow?

2638
01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.491 line:15%
Oh, please fucking run.

2639
01:50:13.491 --> 01:50:15.038 line:15%
Is that her?

2640
01:50:15.038 --> 01:50:16.158 line:15%
(creepy growling)

2641
01:50:16.158 --> 01:50:17.334 line:15%
(screaming)

2642
01:50:17.334 --> 01:50:18.751 line:15%
Oh shit, oh fuck!

2643
01:50:21.291 --> 01:50:25.304 line:15%
BRIAN: Whoa, that looks cool, look, look, look!

2644
01:50:25.304 --> 01:50:30.304 line:15%
You're stuck, look, but you're still alive (screams).

2645
01:50:31.442 --> 01:50:34.206
Look, look at me, dude, yeah!

2646
01:50:34.206 --> 01:50:37.956 line:15%
(dramatic orchestral music)

2647
02:03:57.272 --> 02:03:59.972
MATT: Welcome back! Before we get into the game,

2648
02:03:59.972 --> 02:04:04.193
we do have our winner of the Wyrmwood Hero Vault.

2649
02:04:04.193 --> 02:04:06.610
The winner is BeerBaronessWA,

2650
02:04:07.659 --> 02:04:10.305
which I assume is Washington, but BeerBaronessWA,

2651
02:04:10.305 --> 02:04:11.197
congratulations, we'll get this

2652
02:04:11.197 --> 02:04:14.305
sent to you A-S-A-P, well done.

2653
02:04:14.305 --> 02:04:16.151
Alrighty.

2654
02:04:16.151 --> 02:04:18.023
LAURA: We're in it, we're in it!

2655
02:04:18.023 --> 02:04:21.530
SAM: We're in the Happy Fun Ball.

2656
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:22.583
LAURA: My back hurts.

2657
02:04:22.583 --> 02:04:23.918
SAM: I'm sorry.
LAURA: It's okay.

2658
02:04:23.918 --> 02:04:25.615
SAM: Need lumbar support.

2659
02:04:25.615 --> 02:04:26.448
TALIESIN: Lumbar.

2660
02:04:27.755 --> 02:04:32.755
MATT: The green light recedes, the temperature adjusts.

2661
02:04:33.256 --> 02:04:36.931
Colder than the warm, Nicodranas

2662
02:04:36.931 --> 02:04:41.931
humid interior, that is moisture-less, chilly.

2663
02:04:42.269 --> 02:04:45.149
Glancing around to yourself, you see your party

2664
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:47.786
standing in a diamond shaped chamber

2665
02:04:47.786 --> 02:04:51.261
with a corner on each side of you.

2666
02:04:51.261 --> 02:04:52.750
The room appears to be made of--

2667
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:55.431
MARISHA: There's a few. There's also the Diamond Entrance.

2668
02:04:55.431 --> 02:04:56.730
Probably the Diamond Entrance.

2669
02:04:56.730 --> 02:04:57.739
TRAVIS: (shushing)

2670
02:04:57.739 --> 02:05:00.087
MATT: It looks to be a turquoise-colored marble

2671
02:05:00.087 --> 02:05:04.773
that surrounds you entirely within the chamber.

2672
02:05:04.773 --> 02:05:07.156
Right in front of you, there is a doorway

2673
02:05:07.156 --> 02:05:08.608
and then behind you in the far corner

2674
02:05:08.608 --> 02:05:10.604
opposite of it is another doorway.

2675
02:05:10.604 --> 02:05:15.282
One looks to be of silver trim, the other gold.

2676
02:05:15.282 --> 02:05:16.709
MARISHA: We need to make it to the garden.

2677
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:19.308
TALIESIN: Let's all take a second and breathe,
take a look around.

2678
02:05:19.308 --> 02:05:21.255
Let's just say out loud anything you see and

2679
02:05:21.255 --> 02:05:23.522
don't necessarily touch anything.

2680
02:05:23.522 --> 02:05:24.858
LAURA: Don't touch anything!

2681
02:05:24.858 --> 02:05:26.724
LIAM: And we're going to alert each other--

2682
02:05:26.724 --> 02:05:28.532
MATT: You look up on the ceiling.
LIAM: --of anything we do.

2683
02:05:28.532 --> 02:05:32.011
MATT: Caduceus, you see embedded in the ceiling--

2684
02:05:32.011 --> 02:05:35.994
it's a sculpture of a tower,

2685
02:05:35.994 --> 02:05:38.577
but it's curving.

2686
02:05:38.577 --> 02:05:40.719
It's curving around, almost but not quite

2687
02:05:40.719 --> 02:05:43.188
looping in on itself, like a giant C shape.

2688
02:05:43.188 --> 02:05:47.264
You can see it almost resembling a twisted tree

2689
02:05:47.264 --> 02:05:49.895
that's been bent forcefully into a U

2690
02:05:49.895 --> 02:05:52.755
with a series of smaller branches shooting off of it.

2691
02:05:52.755 --> 02:05:56.350
But you can see within the design windows

2692
02:05:56.350 --> 02:06:00.653
and little doorways and even small gears and

2693
02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:03.038
pieces of it that appear to be constructed.

2694
02:06:03.038 --> 02:06:05.334
TALIESIN: That's a lot.
LAURA: Whoa.

2695
02:06:05.334 --> 02:06:08.698
MATT: It looks like almost odd leaves on a near-barren tree,

2696
02:06:08.698 --> 02:06:11.485
seeing all the little details and dots around this

2697
02:06:11.485 --> 02:06:14.560
curved tower that's thick in places and thin in others.

2698
02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:17.104
It seems to defy physics or logic of any tower

2699
02:06:17.104 --> 02:06:19.437
you've seen.
TALIESIN: Oh, same that way.

2700
02:06:20.319 --> 02:06:22.088
MATT: In the center of the loop, sits a large, thick

2701
02:06:22.088 --> 02:06:23.953
humanoid-like relief without a face.

2702
02:06:23.953 --> 02:06:28.480
Its arms and legs sprawled like an anatomy study.

2703
02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:31.639
It catches your attention. It's pretty, pretty odd.

2704
02:06:31.639 --> 02:06:33.146
SAM: It's just a picture?

2705
02:06:33.146 --> 02:06:35.553
MATT: It's a stone sculpture, like a relief.

2706
02:06:35.553 --> 02:06:37.217
LAURA: But is it moving?

2707
02:06:37.217 --> 02:06:38.737
MATT: Make a perception check.

2708
02:06:38.737 --> 02:06:40.338
TALIESIN: I will definitely get in on that.

2709
02:06:40.338 --> 02:06:41.797
LAURA: Guide me!

2710
02:06:43.928 --> 02:06:46.268
Did that count, because he bounced off his arm?

2711
02:06:46.268 --> 02:06:47.464
TALIESIN: I did catch it with my elbow.

2712
02:06:47.464 --> 02:06:50.365
MATT: You did. You would have taken it
if it was good, though.

2713
02:06:50.365 --> 02:06:51.579
LAURA: Would I have, though?

2714
02:06:51.579 --> 02:06:53.007
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Don't think I would have.

2715
02:06:53.007 --> 02:06:54.376
MATT: I'll let you roll again, then.

2716
02:06:54.376 --> 02:06:55.802
Go for it.
TALIESIN: 20.

2717
02:06:55.802 --> 02:06:57.385
LAURA: I'll roll the same one.

2718
02:06:57.385 --> 02:06:58.663
Same number!

2719
02:06:58.663 --> 02:07:02.547
MATT: Look at that, (laughs), it was meant to be.

2720
02:07:02.547 --> 02:07:03.901
TALIESIN: I rolled 20 perception.

2721
02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:05.609
LAURA: I rolled a 10.
MATT: 10.

2722
02:07:05.609 --> 02:07:08.937
Okay, it is not moving.

2723
02:07:08.937 --> 02:07:10.925
The whole relief appears still.

2724
02:07:10.925 --> 02:07:12.766
TALIESIN: Anything odd about it? Is it giving off any

2725
02:07:12.766 --> 02:07:16.507
kind of-- the gears aren't moving, it just seems to be--

2726
02:07:16.507 --> 02:07:18.513
LIAM: Are they moveable?
MATT: It's just stationary.

2727
02:07:18.513 --> 02:07:20.173
TALIESIN: Are there grooves cut in it or does it all

2728
02:07:20.173 --> 02:07:22.762
seem like one piece of stone?

2729
02:07:22.762 --> 02:07:24.146
It's so far away--

2730
02:07:24.146 --> 02:07:26.242
MATT: It's about 20 feet above you.

2731
02:07:26.242 --> 02:07:29.964
TALIESIN: Oh, that ain't bad.
MATT: At this distance,

2732
02:07:29.964 --> 02:07:33.045
it looks like a carved design.

2733
02:07:33.045 --> 02:07:33.878
What was your question?

2734
02:07:33.878 --> 02:07:36.389
LIAM: Does anything look moveable?

2735
02:07:36.389 --> 02:07:38.724
MATT: Make an investigation check, or you'd probably

2736
02:07:38.724 --> 02:07:39.940
have to get closer to check that.

2737
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:41.824
LAURA: You guys, maybe we shouldn't touch anything

2738
02:07:41.824 --> 02:07:43.860
that we don't have a path for already,

2739
02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:47.874
because, you know, it leads to dragons.

2740
02:07:47.874 --> 02:07:49.332
TALIESIN: We should take a look at it at very least,

2741
02:07:49.332 --> 02:07:51.327
just not touch.
MARISHA: We can figure this out.

2742
02:07:51.327 --> 02:07:53.851
Can I look for any markings on the wall

2743
02:07:53.851 --> 02:07:55.684
or any type of script?

2744
02:07:56.562 --> 02:07:57.873
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

2745
02:07:57.873 --> 02:07:59.912
MARISHA: Any form of indicators?

2746
02:07:59.912 --> 02:08:02.070
TALIESIN: D4.
LAURA: I'm going to look at the doors

2747
02:08:02.070 --> 02:08:03.041
TALIESIN: You've got a d4 on that.
LAURA: See if I can see any

2748
02:08:03.041 --> 02:08:05.367
identifying features on the doors.

2749
02:08:05.367 --> 02:08:06.695
TALIESIN: Yeah, go do your work.
LAURA: So that we know

2750
02:08:06.695 --> 02:08:08.372
which one leads to which.
MARISHA: Thank you.

2751
02:08:08.372 --> 02:08:12.639
Come on, come on, this is what you do.

2752
02:08:12.639 --> 02:08:14.984
Okay, well, it could be worse.

2753
02:08:14.984 --> 02:08:16.341
TRAVIS: That's normally what you do.

2754
02:08:16.341 --> 02:08:17.990
MARISHA: (sighs)

2755
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:20.584
Investigation, you said?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2756
02:08:20.584 --> 02:08:25.584
MARISHA: 20 total-- no, sorry, six plus 12 is 18.

2757
02:08:26.224 --> 02:08:27.807
MATT: Okay.

2758
02:08:27.807 --> 02:08:30.578
Looking along the walls, you don't see any script,

2759
02:08:30.578 --> 02:08:33.556
but as you come across the archways,

2760
02:08:33.556 --> 02:08:38.247
you and Jester both approach and the gold archway,

2761
02:08:38.247 --> 02:08:42.330
there is no door there, it is just a black space.

2762
02:08:43.991 --> 02:08:47.424
You pick up specifically a smell.

2763
02:08:47.424 --> 02:08:50.691
Under the gold

2764
02:08:50.691 --> 02:08:52.185
archway

2765
02:08:52.185 --> 02:08:56.381
of kind of an earthy smell.

2766
02:08:56.381 --> 02:09:00.314
Something that reminds you of open fields and

2767
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.578
greenery.
MARISHA: Okay.

2768
02:09:03.578 --> 02:09:05.345
MATT: You head back towards the silver one

2769
02:09:05.345 --> 02:09:07.448
and there is no discernible scent.

2770
02:09:07.448 --> 02:09:09.101
SAM: Is there a door on that side?

2771
02:09:09.101 --> 02:09:11.997
MATT: No, both arches are just open arches to darkness.

2772
02:09:11.997 --> 02:09:13.572
LAURA: Oh.

2773
02:09:16.663 --> 02:09:20.521
SAM: Is anyone standing underneath that faceless face?

2774
02:09:20.521 --> 02:09:21.882
The featureless face?

2775
02:09:21.882 --> 02:09:23.628
MATT: It's in the center of the chamber

2776
02:09:23.628 --> 02:09:26.018
upward about 20 feet or so and the roof itself

2777
02:09:26.018 --> 02:09:28.236
seems like a curved

2778
02:09:28.236 --> 02:09:30.445
like a stretched dome almost.

2779
02:09:30.445 --> 02:09:32.771
SAM: Has anyone moved directly under that?

2780
02:09:32.771 --> 02:09:33.711
MATT: You guys arrived directly under it.

2781
02:09:33.711 --> 02:09:34.817
SAM: Okay, got it.

2782
02:09:34.817 --> 02:09:36.380
TRAVIS: Is there any sort of dust or dirt

2783
02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:38.231
that's been disturbed on the floor below us,

2784
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:41.036
like prints from someone that might have come before?

2785
02:09:41.036 --> 02:09:42.967
MATT: Make a perception check.

2786
02:09:42.967 --> 02:09:44.442
LAURA: It looks like if we're trying to get

2787
02:09:44.442 --> 02:09:45.983
to the Permaheart--
MATT: Actually, this would be tracks,

2788
02:09:45.983 --> 02:09:47.017
so make a survival,

2789
02:09:47.017 --> 02:09:48.208
that's what this would be.

2790
02:09:48.208 --> 02:09:49.163
LAURA: We need to go to the garden.

2791
02:09:49.163 --> 02:09:51.044
TRAVIS: Reroll, it's a different modifier.

2792
02:09:51.044 --> 02:09:52.818
LAURA: There's two ways to go.

2793
02:09:52.818 --> 02:09:53.651
TRAVIS: 14.

2794
02:09:53.651 --> 02:09:57.401
MATT: 14, there's not a lot of dust in this room.

2795
02:09:58.476 --> 02:09:59.747
For there to be dust in this chamber,

2796
02:09:59.747 --> 02:10:01.811
there would have to be a lot of

2797
02:10:01.811 --> 02:10:05.383
foot traffic or existing of things that give off

2798
02:10:05.383 --> 02:10:08.865
skin flakes. Not a lot of dust in this chamber.

2799
02:10:08.865 --> 02:10:10.139
TRAVIS: Skin flakes, I mean you're right but ugh.

2800
02:10:10.139 --> 02:10:12.356
TALIESIN: Hey, Beau?
MARISHA: Yeah.

2801
02:10:12.356 --> 02:10:14.852
TALIESIN: I think we're going to need a bit of you.
I got an idea.

2802
02:10:14.852 --> 02:10:15.794
MARISHA: What do you mean, need a bit--

2803
02:10:15.794 --> 02:10:17.251
TALIESIN: Lemme give you something.

2804
02:10:17.251 --> 02:10:19.401
And I touch you and cast Enhance Ability

2805
02:10:19.401 --> 02:10:21.776
and give you Fox's Cunning. You have advantage

2806
02:10:21.776 --> 02:10:24.391
on all intelligence checks for the next hour.

2807
02:10:24.391 --> 02:10:26.324
MARISHA: Dope!
MATT: Slick.

2808
02:10:31.154 --> 02:10:32.982
TRAVIS: Caleb?
LIAM: Yeah?

2809
02:10:32.982 --> 02:10:35.343
TRAVIS: A penny for your wizardy thoughts.

2810
02:10:35.343 --> 02:10:36.811
TALIESIN: Remember, you can't do the d4--

2811
02:10:36.811 --> 02:10:40.184
LIAM: Well, the thing I'm thinking about is--

2812
02:10:40.184 --> 02:10:41.996
LAURA: I can.
TALIESIN: You're right.

2813
02:10:41.996 --> 02:10:45.325
LIAM: This place is probably full of magical death

2814
02:10:45.325 --> 02:10:48.788
and I could certainly take my time room by room

2815
02:10:48.788 --> 02:10:52.955
to reveal things to us, but each room,

2816
02:10:52.955 --> 02:10:57.955
whether expediency or clarity is of greater use is--

2817
02:10:58.416 --> 02:11:01.184
TALIESIN: I feel like if I were building a thing like this,

2818
02:11:01.184 --> 02:11:04.047
I would put the worse stuff further in.

2819
02:11:04.047 --> 02:11:06.744
I feel like we're just on the

2820
02:11:06.744 --> 02:11:09.398
I feel like this the lobby. It's not necessarily

2821
02:11:09.398 --> 02:11:11.400
worth going over it unless we can see some signs

2822
02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.890
of people who have been here.

2823
02:11:13.890 --> 02:11:14.840
If that makes sense.

2824
02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:15.891
MARISHA: We have a direction.

2825
02:11:15.891 --> 02:11:17.479
We know we should go to the garden.

2826
02:11:17.479 --> 02:11:19.393
LAURA: Me and Nott have been doing our

2827
02:11:19.393 --> 02:11:21.712
detective due diligence.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2828
02:11:21.712 --> 02:11:23.487
LAURA: And we have found two pathways.

2829
02:11:23.487 --> 02:11:25.569
SAM: (like Jester) Two.
LAURA: That are the shortest way

2830
02:11:25.569 --> 02:11:27.926
to get to the heart.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2831
02:11:27.926 --> 02:11:29.221
LAURA: One of them will take us--

2832
02:11:29.221 --> 02:11:31.362
they'll both take us through the garden, yes.

2833
02:11:31.362 --> 02:11:34.598
One of us will take us to the Crystal Mines,

2834
02:11:34.598 --> 02:11:37.559
to the Dreadnought, to the...

2835
02:11:37.559 --> 02:11:40.291
SAM and LAURA: Experiment Chambers.

2836
02:11:40.291 --> 02:11:42.870
LAURA: And then to the Heart Study,

2837
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:45.766
and then to the heart, potentially.

2838
02:11:45.766 --> 02:11:47.262
SAM: Or B.

2839
02:11:47.262 --> 02:11:49.321
To the garden,

2840
02:11:49.321 --> 02:11:53.140
the Tower Machine, the Golem Workshop,

2841
02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:55.465
SAM and LAURA: Experiment Chambers, Heart Study--

2842
02:11:55.465 --> 02:11:56.778
LAURA: Heart.
SAM: So basically, we're deciding

2843
02:11:56.778 --> 02:12:01.399
between Dreadnought or Golem Workshop.

2844
02:12:01.399 --> 02:12:02.732
TALIESIN: I feel like...

2845
02:12:03.596 --> 02:12:05.450
MARISHA: Dreadnought sounds fucking terrifying.
TRAVIS: Are you certain there's just

2846
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:09.350
no undiscovered route from, I don't know,

2847
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:11.875
the Tapestry Entrance to the Heart Study?

2848
02:12:11.875 --> 02:12:13.028
TALIESIN: I don't know if

2849
02:12:13.028 --> 02:12:16.069
we're trailblazing here, necessarily.

2850
02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:18.838
TRAVIS: I'm just putting it out there, of course,

2851
02:12:18.838 --> 02:12:21.338
because who are we, the guest quarters

2852
02:12:21.338 --> 02:12:23.908
to the dining hall to the Tapestry Entrance

2853
02:12:23.908 --> 02:12:27.089
all have words in them that don't suck mortal death!

2854
02:12:27.089 --> 02:12:28.330
(laughter)

2855
02:12:28.330 --> 02:12:30.244
LAURA: True, but they might not suck mortal death

2856
02:12:30.244 --> 02:12:32.629
because they're not guarding the heart.

2857
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:34.276
TRAVIS: Maybe.
LAURA: Both of these pathways--

2858
02:12:34.276 --> 02:12:36.095
TRAVIS: He's a talented artist, and there seem to be

2859
02:12:36.095 --> 02:12:38.185
one, two, three, four little sections

2860
02:12:38.185 --> 02:12:41.404
on the Tapestry Entrance and only one, two

2861
02:12:41.404 --> 02:12:43.729
routes out of the map so far.

2862
02:12:43.729 --> 02:12:46.355
If we could find the one that went Boop!

2863
02:12:46.355 --> 02:12:47.521
MARISHA: Also, just pointing it out,

2864
02:12:47.521 --> 02:12:52.471
not trying to throw another thing to think about,

2865
02:12:52.471 --> 02:12:57.253
but in my investigation check,

2866
02:12:58.331 --> 02:13:01.388
the Arcane Armory and the study were both

2867
02:13:01.388 --> 02:13:05.751
heavily poured over. Do we feel like there's any need

2868
02:13:05.751 --> 02:13:08.031
to go to there, or--

2869
02:13:08.031 --> 02:13:13.031
LAURA: Probably because they lead to a lot of other things?

2870
02:13:13.208 --> 02:13:14.617
MARISHA: Maybe.

2871
02:13:14.617 --> 02:13:16.535
SAM: Well, why don't we take the first step.

2872
02:13:16.535 --> 02:13:18.963
We know we have to go through the garden to get anywhere.

2873
02:13:18.963 --> 02:13:20.279
So let's go there and maybe we call--

2874
02:13:20.279 --> 02:13:22.232
LAURA: Fjord, how would we even get
to the Tapestry Entrance?

2875
02:13:22.232 --> 02:13:23.818
We're at the Diamond Entrance.

2876
02:13:23.818 --> 02:13:25.347
MATT: As a note, too, the Tapestry Entrance,

2877
02:13:25.347 --> 02:13:30.204
you guys checked not all but I think three of the tapestries

2878
02:13:30.204 --> 02:13:31.649
one of which was the exit,

2879
02:13:31.649 --> 02:13:34.534
one of which electrocuted a bunch of you,

2880
02:13:34.534 --> 02:13:38.928
and another one that seemed to have, if I recall,

2881
02:13:38.928 --> 02:13:41.352
I have to look it up, but another form of--

2882
02:13:41.352 --> 02:13:43.143
MARISHA: Pain?
MATT: Pain.

2883
02:13:43.143 --> 02:13:44.575
TRAVIS: That's right.

2884
02:13:44.575 --> 02:13:46.592
And it goes bing, boom, boom.

2885
02:13:46.592 --> 02:13:47.669
LIAM: We spent very little time--

2886
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:49.552
MATT: There is a tapestry you haven't checked out.

2887
02:13:49.552 --> 02:13:52.126
LIAM: Very little time in the study before Fjord

2888
02:13:52.126 --> 02:13:53.959
sent us to the dragon.

2889
02:13:55.170 --> 02:13:57.232
TALIESIN: I'm excited about the garden.
I feel like the garden is--

2890
02:13:57.232 --> 02:13:58.951
SAM: Let's go to the garden. Then we can call--

2891
02:13:58.951 --> 02:14:00.583
we can always call with the mirror--

2892
02:14:00.583 --> 02:14:04.666
we can call Lady Alina, Alena, Elena?

2893
02:14:04.666 --> 02:14:05.854
Something like that.

2894
02:14:05.854 --> 02:14:07.179
LAURA: Allura.

2895
02:14:07.179 --> 02:14:09.012
SAM: I like Elena better.

2896
02:14:10.278 --> 02:14:11.861
TRAVIS: The garden it is.

2897
02:14:13.006 --> 02:14:15.012
TALIESIN: What's the difference between these two doors?

2898
02:14:15.012 --> 02:14:16.674
TRAVIS: Gold and silver.
LAURA: One is gold, one is silver.

2899
02:14:16.674 --> 02:14:17.642
SAM: One leads to the garden.

2900
02:14:17.642 --> 02:14:20.495
MARISHA: This one's to the garden, the gold one.

2901
02:14:20.495 --> 02:14:22.504
G for garden.
LAURA: Let's fucking do it!

2902
02:14:22.504 --> 02:14:24.553
Let's do it, let's be proactive.

2903
02:14:24.553 --> 02:14:25.972
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm in touch with nature.

2904
02:14:25.972 --> 02:14:27.604
SAM: She smelled stuff on it.

2905
02:14:27.604 --> 02:14:29.031
She knows where we're going.

2906
02:14:29.031 --> 02:14:31.426
MARISHA: Are you impressed or judging me?

2907
02:14:31.426 --> 02:14:32.480
TALIESIN: It can be both.

2908
02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:35.329
(laughter)

2909
02:14:35.329 --> 02:14:36.654
SAM: To the garden!

2910
02:14:36.654 --> 02:14:38.274
MARISHA: To the garden!

2911
02:14:38.274 --> 02:14:40.319
MATT: All right, you step to the precipice of the

2912
02:14:40.319 --> 02:14:44.760
golden archway. Who steps through first?

2913
02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:46.150
MARISHA: I'm there.

2914
02:14:46.150 --> 02:14:48.434
LAURA: I'll follow.
MARISHA: Zoom!

2915
02:14:48.434 --> 02:14:49.587
MATT: Beau leaps through.

2916
02:14:49.587 --> 02:14:51.796
LAURA: I go right after.
TRAVIS: I'll go third.

2917
02:14:51.796 --> 02:14:52.997
MATT: Fjord jumps through.
TALIESIN: I'll go fourth.

2918
02:14:52.997 --> 02:14:54.339
MATT: Caduceus jumps through.

2919
02:14:54.339 --> 02:14:55.519
SAM: I'll go.

2920
02:14:55.519 --> 02:14:58.309
MATT: Nott goes through, Caleb?

2921
02:14:58.309 --> 02:14:59.223
LIAM: (whooshes)

2922
02:14:59.223 --> 02:15:00.806
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: All right.

2923
02:15:02.051 --> 02:15:03.956
You step through the archway and

2924
02:15:03.956 --> 02:15:05.966
the moment you step into it you see this

2925
02:15:05.966 --> 02:15:08.647
tiny little point of light.

2926
02:15:08.647 --> 02:15:11.452
Like faint greenish blue tint.

2927
02:15:11.452 --> 02:15:14.271
It (whooshes) opens up rapidly

2928
02:15:14.271 --> 02:15:16.202
and for a split second you can see the shape

2929
02:15:16.202 --> 02:15:18.136
of what looks to be some sort of a

2930
02:15:18.136 --> 02:15:22.755
lush, jungle-type location awaiting you,

2931
02:15:22.755 --> 02:15:25.220
but it's climbing at you at a rapid speed.

2932
02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:27.391
For a moment, trying to figure out

2933
02:15:27.391 --> 02:15:28.807
what's up, what's down, you feel like

2934
02:15:28.807 --> 02:15:32.135
you're plummeting at full speed from a great height.

2935
02:15:32.135 --> 02:15:34.363
You catch your breath in your lungs, but there's no air.

2936
02:15:34.363 --> 02:15:35.931
And then suddenly (thud),

2937
02:15:35.931 --> 02:15:40.313
you stumble out with a very, very extreme amount of force

2938
02:15:40.313 --> 02:15:44.793
tumbling across a grassy, thick jungle floor.

2939
02:15:44.793 --> 02:15:46.573
Make an acrobatics check for me.

2940
02:15:46.573 --> 02:15:50.937
All of you need to make an acrobatics check.

2941
02:15:50.937 --> 02:15:54.239
LIAM: That's what you roll high on, really, acrobatics?

2942
02:15:54.239 --> 02:15:55.907
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
SAM: Ooh!

2943
02:15:55.907 --> 02:15:57.440
MARISHA: 18.
LIAM: 20.

2944
02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:58.306
SAM: 20.

2945
02:15:58.306 --> 02:15:59.522
LAURA: 13.
TALIESIN: One.

2946
02:15:59.522 --> 02:16:01.508
(laughter)

2947
02:16:01.508 --> 02:16:02.907
TRAVIS: Get down with that nature, yo.

2948
02:16:02.907 --> 02:16:05.090
MATT: So all of you take a shoulder tumble into

2949
02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:08.283
the momentum that carries you through this opening,

2950
02:16:08.283 --> 02:16:12.175
skidding, missing a few sharp rocks.

2951
02:16:12.175 --> 02:16:15.281
Caduceus comes in ass over tea kettle,

2952
02:16:15.281 --> 02:16:18.504
(scraping sound) skidding into the dirt.

2953
02:16:18.504 --> 02:16:20.477
LIAM: That's a big tea kettle.
MATT: Yeah.

2954
02:16:20.477 --> 02:16:23.196
And you do suffer

2955
02:16:23.196 --> 02:16:24.893
four points of bludgeoning damage.

2956
02:16:24.893 --> 02:16:28.806
TALIESIN: Do I have to make a Concentration check?

2957
02:16:28.806 --> 02:16:30.539
MATT: You do.
LAURA: Aww!

2958
02:16:30.539 --> 02:16:32.061
TALIESIN: Okay, four points of bludgeoning damage.

2959
02:16:32.061 --> 02:16:33.263
MATT: So just roll a constitution saving throw.

2960
02:16:33.263 --> 02:16:34.620
TRAVIS: What do you have up?

2961
02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:36.120
LAURA: Enhance Ability.

2962
02:16:37.299 --> 02:16:39.906
TALIESIN: Yeah, thankfully I have advantage, so

2963
02:16:39.906 --> 02:16:42.361
yeah, that's 19.
MATT: 19, you're fine.

2964
02:16:42.361 --> 02:16:44.582
TALIESIN: And I did roll another natural one,
but I get to ignore it.

2965
02:16:44.582 --> 02:16:46.764
MATT: You do, fair enough.

2966
02:16:46.764 --> 02:16:47.597
All right.

2967
02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:52.257
So as you all adjust your bearings,

2968
02:16:53.761 --> 02:16:56.920
you now stand within this incredibly tall room.

2969
02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:59.229
You actually cannot see the ceiling from where you stand.

2970
02:16:59.229 --> 02:17:03.814
Instead, you're in the center of a lush jungle.

2971
02:17:03.814 --> 02:17:06.433
With thick, vine-covered tropical trees

2972
02:17:06.433 --> 02:17:08.769
stretching up multiple stories towards a

2973
02:17:08.769 --> 02:17:12.027
sourceless, unchanging sunset.
LAURA: Wow.

2974
02:17:12.937 --> 02:17:16.236
MATT: Soft orange and red glow appearing through

2975
02:17:16.236 --> 02:17:20.052
a somewhat muggy, humid sky above.

2976
02:17:21.415 --> 02:17:23.845
Or it's a room, you have to consciously remind

2977
02:17:23.845 --> 02:17:27.923
yourself that or if you've stumbled into some other plane.

2978
02:17:27.923 --> 02:17:31.927
It should be a room, but it feels like a jungle.

2979
02:17:31.927 --> 02:17:33.517
SAM: Is this where the wild things are?

2980
02:17:33.517 --> 02:17:35.209
(laughter)

2981
02:17:36.349 --> 02:17:40.530
LAURA: When it said garden, I thought like roses.

2982
02:17:40.530 --> 02:17:42.733
MATT: You can see amongst the dozens and dozens

2983
02:17:42.733 --> 02:17:45.576
of immediately visible thick jungle trees,

2984
02:17:45.576 --> 02:17:50.576
knotted and vine-covered roots and trunk.

2985
02:17:50.615 --> 02:17:54.269
You can see the various bits of fauna and ferns

2986
02:17:54.269 --> 02:17:57.859
that are heavily overgrown the base and the floor,

2987
02:17:57.859 --> 02:17:59.542
the vicinity around you.

2988
02:17:59.542 --> 02:18:01.349
You can see past the trees to the front

2989
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:02.857
and left of where you landed

2990
02:18:02.857 --> 02:18:05.824
what looks to be a massive mountainside cliff

2991
02:18:05.824 --> 02:18:09.834
of rock that rises up past visual sight

2992
02:18:09.834 --> 02:18:12.512
and you can hear the faint sound of rushing water,

2993
02:18:12.512 --> 02:18:15.157
like a waterfall just out of sight.

2994
02:18:15.157 --> 02:18:16.871
LIAM: He has sketched that in on his map.

2995
02:18:16.871 --> 02:18:18.860
It's possibly of significance.

2996
02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:22.033
LAURA: What if all this is just a big illusion or something?

2997
02:18:22.033 --> 02:18:23.485
MARISHA: It could be.
SAM: Go touch some--

2998
02:18:23.485 --> 02:18:25.610
go draw a dick on a tree.

2999
02:18:25.610 --> 02:18:27.971
LAURA: I feel like we shouldn't touch anything.

3000
02:18:27.971 --> 02:18:30.538
SAM: But look at all these surfaces.

3001
02:18:30.538 --> 02:18:32.918
MATT: As you look around, you begin to see now these

3002
02:18:32.918 --> 02:18:36.328
soft little motes of dancing light,

3003
02:18:36.328 --> 02:18:38.406
faintly orange like little fireflies

3004
02:18:38.406 --> 02:18:41.272
that just glide through the air around you.

3005
02:18:41.272 --> 02:18:43.037
MARISHA: Does this look recognizable to anything

3006
02:18:43.037 --> 02:18:44.668
I might have studied?

3007
02:18:44.668 --> 02:18:46.727
MATT: Make an arcana check.

3008
02:18:46.727 --> 02:18:47.998
TRAVIS: The motes aren't connected to anything,

3009
02:18:47.998 --> 02:18:49.058
they're free floating?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3010
02:18:49.058 --> 02:18:51.319
TALIESIN: With advantage.

3011
02:18:51.319 --> 02:18:53.902
MARISHA: Oh yeah, it is intellect.

3012
02:18:54.927 --> 02:18:57.707
I'm going to leave that one there.

3013
02:18:57.707 --> 02:19:00.336
Mm-hmm, 19.

3014
02:19:00.336 --> 02:19:02.336
MATT: 19.
MARISHA: Thanks, Caduceus.

3015
02:19:03.335 --> 02:19:08.335
MATT: These you've heard about, they're referred to as

3016
02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:09.806
Scribe Mites.

3017
02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:15.609
They just freely float, but around the presence of

3018
02:19:15.609 --> 02:19:19.688
magical spellcraft or incantations or any sort of

3019
02:19:19.688 --> 02:19:24.688
strong magical presence, they gravitate towards it to eat.

3020
02:19:24.935 --> 02:19:27.762
LAURA: (groans) (gasps)

3021
02:19:27.762 --> 02:19:30.581
No wonder, if Allura had been here,

3022
02:19:30.581 --> 02:19:31.883
they would have all come to her and tried

3023
02:19:31.883 --> 02:19:33.925
to devour her.
MARISHA: Eat her.

3024
02:19:33.925 --> 02:19:37.747
MARISHA: They're like lighting bugs,
but piranha lighting bugs.

3025
02:19:37.747 --> 02:19:39.221
TRAVIS: We have an Allura, yeah.

3026
02:19:39.221 --> 02:19:41.957
LIAM: Caleb, why aren't they trying to eat you?

3027
02:19:41.957 --> 02:19:43.262
Are you not powerful enough?

3028
02:19:43.262 --> 02:19:46.022
SAM: Of course he's powerful enough.
He can do whatever he wants.

3029
02:19:46.022 --> 02:19:47.188
MARISHA: I'd just be careful, maybe not--

3030
02:19:47.188 --> 02:19:48.565
LIAM: Time will tell.

3031
02:19:48.565 --> 02:19:50.273
MARISHA: --cast anything.

3032
02:19:51.943 --> 02:19:53.056
Sorry.

3033
02:19:53.056 --> 02:19:55.921
TRAVIS: The ground beneath our feet, grass, moving?

3034
02:19:55.921 --> 02:19:59.776
Anything adapting to our presence here?

3035
02:19:59.776 --> 02:20:01.354
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3036
02:20:01.354 --> 02:20:04.283
Investigation or perception, your choice.

3037
02:20:04.283 --> 02:20:07.572
TRAVIS: 17 investigation.

3038
02:20:07.572 --> 02:20:08.905
MATT: 17?
LAURA: Crystal Mines.

3039
02:20:09.742 --> 02:20:11.464
MATT: Nothing appears to be shifting or moving

3040
02:20:11.464 --> 02:20:13.824
out of the ordinary. It appears to be

3041
02:20:13.824 --> 02:20:17.025
just standing in the middle of a natural space.

3042
02:20:17.025 --> 02:20:18.702
LAURA: We have to find entrances,

3043
02:20:18.702 --> 02:20:20.607
something that will lead us to another--

3044
02:20:20.607 --> 02:20:23.593
SAM: Would you like to go to the mountains or to the water?

3045
02:20:23.593 --> 02:20:26.096
TRAVIS: Caleb did say the waterfall was on the map.

3046
02:20:26.096 --> 02:20:28.022
Perhaps we should--
LIAM: He sketched it there.

3047
02:20:28.022 --> 02:20:29.430
It's probably no accident.
LAURA: It looks like the line

3048
02:20:29.430 --> 02:20:34.072
leading to the Crystal Mines is at the top of the garden?

3049
02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:36.979
Maybe that is useful.

3050
02:20:36.979 --> 02:20:38.198
TRAVIS: Maybe we climb up.

3051
02:20:38.198 --> 02:20:41.045
LIAM: Well, the best lead we have is his map.

3052
02:20:41.045 --> 02:20:43.649
Otherwise, we are just picking a random direction, <i>ja</i>?

3053
02:20:43.649 --> 02:20:45.133
TALIESIN: Do we want to make our presence known

3054
02:20:45.133 --> 02:20:46.858
or do we want to try and keep it quiet?

3055
02:20:46.858 --> 02:20:48.625
LAURA: Let's try and keep it quiet here.

3056
02:20:48.625 --> 02:20:49.458
TALIESIN: Okay.

3057
02:20:49.458 --> 02:20:51.640
MARISHA: There's Scribe Mites that'll tear his flesh off.

3058
02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.259
TALIESIN: That's fair.

3059
02:20:53.259 --> 02:20:55.820
TRAVIS: We'll head down towards the water.

3060
02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:57.255
SAM: Sure.

3061
02:20:57.255 --> 02:20:59.371
TRAVIS: In the direction of the waterfall.

3062
02:20:59.371 --> 02:21:01.681
Looking for a path.
TALIESIN: Avoiding the little--

3063
02:21:01.681 --> 02:21:02.878
MATT: Can I have a marching order, please?

3064
02:21:02.878 --> 02:21:06.010
(gasps and oohs)

3065
02:21:06.010 --> 02:21:07.843
LIAM: Caleb in the middle.

3066
02:21:09.334 --> 02:21:13.260
TRAVIS: Do we want the nature boys to walk up front?

3067
02:21:13.260 --> 02:21:15.209
TALIESIN: I'll keep-- we can have perception in the front

3068
02:21:15.209 --> 02:21:16.999
or perception in the back, if you want.

3069
02:21:16.999 --> 02:21:18.950
MARISHA: I'll be up front with Caduceus since

3070
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:21.962
I've got his blessing right now.

3071
02:21:21.962 --> 02:21:23.335
MATT: Is Caduceus in the front or is Fjord in the front?

3072
02:21:23.335 --> 02:21:25.003
TRAVIS: Caduceus and Beau in the front.

3073
02:21:25.003 --> 02:21:26.310
MATT: You got it.

3074
02:21:26.310 --> 02:21:27.457
And the Fjord, where are you?

3075
02:21:27.457 --> 02:21:30.018
TRAVIS: I will be behind them.
MATT: All righty, and then?

3076
02:21:30.018 --> 02:21:32.398
Caleb after that.
LAURA: And then I'll follow Caleb.

3077
02:21:32.398 --> 02:21:33.731
LIAM: Oh man, it's a mullet,

3078
02:21:33.731 --> 02:21:35.853
business in the front, party in the back.

3079
02:21:35.853 --> 02:21:38.118
SAM: I'll follow Jester, and that's it.

3080
02:21:38.118 --> 02:21:40.680
LAURA: ♪ I will follow him ♪

3081
02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.558
SAM: ♪ Follow him ♪

3082
02:21:42.558 --> 02:21:43.891
MATT: All right.

3083
02:21:44.824 --> 02:21:49.468
Stepping through the thick jungle underbrush,

3084
02:21:49.468 --> 02:21:52.915
pushing past any strange colorful ferns or

3085
02:21:52.915 --> 02:21:56.122
brightly colored fruit, of which there are a few

3086
02:21:56.122 --> 02:22:00.371
plants that seem to produce some vibrant looking delicacies.

3087
02:22:00.371 --> 02:22:02.198
TALIESIN: Oh man.
LIAM: Nah.

3088
02:22:02.198 --> 02:22:04.578
LAURA: It's so tempting.
MARISHA: We've done that before.

3089
02:22:04.578 --> 02:22:07.688
MATT: The soft motes of the Scribe Mites

3090
02:22:07.688 --> 02:22:10.493
just gently floating through, not a cluster of them,

3091
02:22:10.493 --> 02:22:13.623
but every ten feet, there'll be like two or three

3092
02:22:13.623 --> 02:22:17.256
that drift by, not acknowledging your presence.

3093
02:22:19.515 --> 02:22:21.669
You go past a few trees and as Caduceus and Beau

3094
02:22:21.669 --> 02:22:23.173
make their way around one edge,

3095
02:22:23.173 --> 02:22:27.182
you come upon the waterfall

3096
02:22:27.182 --> 02:22:30.600
that's cascading over rocks at the base of this mountain.

3097
02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:32.433
You're unable to really see the source.

3098
02:22:32.433 --> 02:22:35.309
It gets hazy further and further up,

3099
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:38.288
blocking any sight of the actual source of this river

3100
02:22:38.288 --> 02:22:41.282
or fall, but you see as it breaks over the rocks below

3101
02:22:41.282 --> 02:22:43.842
it empties into a beautiful pool,

3102
02:22:43.842 --> 02:22:46.425
maybe about 40, 50 feet across.

3103
02:22:47.330 --> 02:22:49.110
LAURA: It's really pretty.

3104
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:50.984
TALIESIN: Is it possible that there are things hidden

3105
02:22:50.984 --> 02:22:52.810
behind the waterfall?
LAURA: Yeah, in a lot of the books

3106
02:22:52.810 --> 02:22:55.021
that I read that's where the lovers go

3107
02:22:55.021 --> 02:22:56.722
and there's always like a little--

3108
02:22:56.722 --> 02:22:59.423
MARISHA: We have to check behind
LAURA: Secret cove and they--

3109
02:22:59.423 --> 02:23:00.773
SAM: Why don't you and Fjord check it out?

3110
02:23:00.773 --> 02:23:03.166
LAURA: --take off their clothes behind the waterfall.

3111
02:23:03.166 --> 02:23:04.906
SAM: Maybe you and Fjord should go?

3112
02:23:04.906 --> 02:23:06.682
TALIESIN: Or maybe we should all stick together

3113
02:23:06.682 --> 02:23:09.932
and just be, I mean, clever about this.

3114
02:23:10.767 --> 02:23:14.490
Oh, am I mis-- never mind, I don't want that.

3115
02:23:15.415 --> 02:23:16.935
MARISHA: Towards the waterfall--

3116
02:23:16.935 --> 02:23:19.309
TALIESIN: Is the water-- other than the
pressure from the waterfall,

3117
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:21.004
there's no weird movements in there.

3118
02:23:21.004 --> 02:23:23.751
Can you see the bottom of it? Is it crystal clear?

3119
02:23:23.751 --> 02:23:25.434
MATT: You can make a perception check as
you guys approach it.

3120
02:23:25.434 --> 02:23:27.494
TALIESIN: I'll make a perception check.
LAURA: Guide you. I'm guiding you.

3121
02:23:27.494 --> 02:23:29.698
TALIESIN: Thank you. Uh... (sound of hesitation)

3122
02:23:29.698 --> 02:23:31.568
LAURA: What?

3123
02:23:31.568 --> 02:23:33.053
I can guide you.

3124
02:23:33.053 --> 02:23:36.778
TALIESIN: It's, uh-- do we want to cast magic around here

3125
02:23:36.778 --> 02:23:38.421
or do we not want to cast magic around here?

3126
02:23:38.421 --> 02:23:39.964
SAM: Do it, happening.
LAURA: I already said it.

3127
02:23:39.964 --> 02:23:41.905
MARISHA: I would try to avoid it.

3128
02:23:41.905 --> 02:23:43.860
LAURA: I already said I was doing it. I'm sorry.

3129
02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:46.379
MATT: Okay, so you cast Guidance

3130
02:23:46.379 --> 02:23:50.479
and touch Caduceus, you may take your Guidance roll.

3131
02:23:50.479 --> 02:23:53.303
TALIESIN: I mean, it helped, too, but 17.

3132
02:23:53.303 --> 02:23:55.653
MATT: 17, okay.

3133
02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:00.346
As you cast the spell and pull your hand back,

3134
02:24:00.346 --> 02:24:02.582
there's that brief spark as you utter the phrase

3135
02:24:02.582 --> 02:24:05.426
beneath your breath in support and you remember, "Shit."

3136
02:24:05.426 --> 02:24:07.830
All of you glance upward and the nearby mites

3137
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:12.087
suddenly go (whooshes) and all stop about a foot away from

3138
02:24:12.087 --> 02:24:14.391
Jester and then keep floating.

3139
02:24:14.391 --> 02:24:18.913
It wasn't enough of a pull to keep a source going

3140
02:24:18.913 --> 02:24:21.506
for the cantrip that she cast.

3141
02:24:21.506 --> 02:24:22.975
TRAVIS and MARISHA: The cantrip.

3142
02:24:22.975 --> 02:24:25.700
SAM: It has to be a lot bigger than a cantrip.

3143
02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:28.031
TALIESIN: Let's not test that.

3144
02:24:28.031 --> 02:24:29.992
LAURA: I wouldn't want to do like another cantrip right now,

3145
02:24:29.992 --> 02:24:31.460
you know what I mean?
TALIESIN: No.

3146
02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:34.374
MATT: So you rolled a 17?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3147
02:24:34.374 --> 02:24:35.976
MATT: Looking at the edge of the water,

3148
02:24:35.976 --> 02:24:39.924
it's murky and you can see thick algae

3149
02:24:39.924 --> 02:24:42.313
banks, but there is what looks like the algae

3150
02:24:42.313 --> 02:24:45.052
almost seems to turn into a vortex

3151
02:24:45.052 --> 02:24:48.290
or some sort of opening that continues down

3152
02:24:48.290 --> 02:24:50.142
into darkness at the base of this pond

3153
02:24:50.142 --> 02:24:53.084
about 30, 40 feet down.

3154
02:24:54.296 --> 02:24:57.404
You also do see just beyond the edge of the waterfall,

3155
02:24:57.404 --> 02:24:59.386
there's an area of the rocks where it looks like

3156
02:24:59.386 --> 02:25:03.313
there's a slight opening that could possibly be walked

3157
02:25:03.313 --> 02:25:05.044
beyond the water, but you're not sure

3158
02:25:05.044 --> 02:25:07.624
if it's a cavern or just a gap.

3159
02:25:07.624 --> 02:25:09.884
TALIESIN: Let's check-- I have a funny feeling that there's

3160
02:25:09.884 --> 02:25:11.109
several different exits, maybe.

3161
02:25:11.109 --> 02:25:12.801
Let's try the one behind the waterfall.

3162
02:25:12.801 --> 02:25:14.102
LAURA: It could take us...

3163
02:25:14.102 --> 02:25:16.036
at least, you know--

3164
02:25:16.036 --> 02:25:17.261
MATT: (frog croak)

3165
02:25:17.261 --> 02:25:18.890
LAURA: --we might have a--
SAM: What was that?

3166
02:25:18.890 --> 02:25:21.087
MATT: You hear this, you hear this, you hear this.

3167
02:25:21.087 --> 02:25:23.739
You hear this little-- (frog croak)

3168
02:25:23.739 --> 02:25:25.373
SAM: That's just a frog.
LAURA: Is there a frog?

3169
02:25:25.373 --> 02:25:27.428
MARISHA: I'm looking at the bank.
MATT: Okay.

3170
02:25:27.428 --> 02:25:30.000
You see a tiny frog there on the edge.

3171
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.361
TALIESIN: Hey, Mr. Frog.
MATT: (croaking)

3172
02:25:32.361 --> 02:25:34.992
From other sources and you glance up toward the rocks

3173
02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:36.849
on the edge of the waterfall and you think you see

3174
02:25:36.849 --> 02:25:40.086
something duck down behind a rock.

3175
02:25:40.086 --> 02:25:41.018
MARISHA: Be on alert.

3176
02:25:41.018 --> 02:25:43.359
TALIESIN: No chance we can just keep this cool, is there?

3177
02:25:44.347 --> 02:25:46.177
MATT: (various croaks)

3178
02:25:46.177 --> 02:25:48.059
LAURA: Oh no.

3179
02:25:48.059 --> 02:25:49.057
TRAVIS: We should start moving.

3180
02:25:49.057 --> 02:25:51.864
LAURA: Let's move, let's move. Where are we going?

3181
02:25:51.864 --> 02:25:53.345
TALIESIN: Towards behind the waterfall.

3182
02:25:53.345 --> 02:25:54.754
SAM: Can we get close to the waterfall

3183
02:25:54.754 --> 02:25:58.323
without going along the water
or do we have to swim through?

3184
02:25:58.323 --> 02:26:00.892
MATT: You could attempt to climb up on the side if you like.

3185
02:26:00.892 --> 02:26:03.636
MARISHA: How big are these frogs?
LAURA: They're little?

3186
02:26:03.636 --> 02:26:04.918
MATT: You saw a handful of small frogs,

3187
02:26:04.918 --> 02:26:07.490
but the sounds you're hearing aren't coming
from the frogs on the bank.

3188
02:26:07.490 --> 02:26:09.837
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, good, cool, sweet, let's keep going.

3189
02:26:09.837 --> 02:26:11.672
MARISHA: Yeah, move, move, move, move, move.

3190
02:26:11.672 --> 02:26:14.511
SAM: I'm going to dash across the water.

3191
02:26:14.511 --> 02:26:15.736
TALIESIN: W-what?

3192
02:26:15.736 --> 02:26:17.328
LAURA: Oh, you can walk on water.

3193
02:26:17.328 --> 02:26:19.148
MATT: So you (stepping sounds) dart across

3194
02:26:19.148 --> 02:26:20.758
and as you're-- make a perception check.

3195
02:26:20.758 --> 02:26:22.210
TRAVIS: (roars)

3196
02:26:22.210 --> 02:26:24.084
(laughter)

3197
02:26:24.084 --> 02:26:25.237
SAM: Five-- six.

3198
02:26:25.237 --> 02:26:27.658
MATT: Six, you go running across the way.

3199
02:26:27.658 --> 02:26:29.008
You guys see Nott
(stepping sounds)

3200
02:26:29.008 --> 02:26:31.374
TALIESIN: Nott, what are you--
I wouldn't just go.

3201
02:26:31.374 --> 02:26:33.031
MATT: (roars)
No joke.

3202
02:26:33.031 --> 02:26:35.322
The water begins to break from underneath

3203
02:26:35.322 --> 02:26:38.359
as some large hulking shape rises up

3204
02:26:38.359 --> 02:26:42.442
from beneath the pond.
(laughter)

3205
02:26:43.378 --> 02:26:45.345
SAM: Oh god, oh god.

3206
02:26:45.345 --> 02:26:47.447
LIAM: We said we were going to call out

3207
02:26:47.447 --> 02:26:49.512
our actions before we did them.

3208
02:26:49.512 --> 02:26:51.628
LAURA: Why would you do that in the Happy Fun Ball?!

3209
02:26:51.628 --> 02:26:53.563
SAM: I thought that they were things on the land.

3210
02:26:53.563 --> 02:26:54.431
MATT: 24!

3211
02:26:54.431 --> 02:26:55.859
SAM: To hit?
MATT: Yes.

3212
02:26:55.859 --> 02:26:58.737
SAM: Yes, it hits!
MATT: All right!

3213
02:26:58.737 --> 02:27:00.758
MARISHA: We're about to watch Nott get eaten.

3214
02:27:00.758 --> 02:27:02.890
TRAVIS: We wanted to go fly fishing
while we were here, right?

3215
02:27:02.890 --> 02:27:04.795
Let's use the goblin as bait, sure.

3216
02:27:04.795 --> 02:27:06.777
LAURA: Use your whip!

3217
02:27:06.777 --> 02:27:08.503
Use your whip, quick!

3218
02:27:08.503 --> 02:27:09.730
Try to catch Nott!

3219
02:27:09.730 --> 02:27:11.030
LIAM: I think this is happening.

3220
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:14.260
MATT: This is happening, this is a surprise against Nott.

3221
02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:16.168
So you suffer...

3222
02:27:17.395 --> 02:27:20.140
18 points of piercing damage.

3223
02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:21.908
SAM: Uncanny Dodge.

3224
02:27:21.908 --> 02:27:24.442
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: The reach is ten feet.

3225
02:27:24.442 --> 02:27:27.470
MATT: And Nott is no longer visible,

3226
02:27:27.470 --> 02:27:31.167
as a giant green creature's toothy maw--

3227
02:27:31.167 --> 02:27:35.224
I got to use it again-- collapses around

3228
02:27:35.224 --> 02:27:39.080
Nott's form and then comes to rest a bit in the water.

3229
02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.271
TRAVIS: Fucking dildo.
MATT: Green tendrils (slurps)

3230
02:27:41.271 --> 02:27:44.332
begin to wrap around. I need you guys to roll initiative.

3231
02:27:44.332 --> 02:27:46.241
MARISHA: I'm sorry, but that's too funny!

3232
02:27:46.241 --> 02:27:48.791
SAM: But I thought that the things were on land!

3233
02:27:48.791 --> 02:27:50.882
TRAVIS: No, you didn't, you fucking knew!

3234
02:27:50.882 --> 02:27:54.588
SAM: He said frogs!
TRAVIS: You ran across the water!

3235
02:27:54.588 --> 02:27:56.904
MARISHA: He said it was pristine and beautiful.

3236
02:27:56.904 --> 02:27:58.945
You never trust beauty in D&amp;D!

3237
02:27:58.945 --> 02:28:02.288
SAM: This combat is powered by Dwarven Forge, Marisha!

3238
02:28:02.288 --> 02:28:03.855
LIAM: You don't have to be a troll every time!

3239
02:28:03.855 --> 02:28:07.288
SAM: I'm not being a troll, I thought
that the thing was on land!

3242
02:28:10.982 --> 02:28:13.283
TRAVIS: Look at this waterfall!
LAURA: It's really beautiful.

3243
02:28:13.283 --> 02:28:16.562
MATT: You guys are moving around the side
of the waterfall here.

3244
02:28:16.562 --> 02:28:18.623
TRAVIS: Look how small the pool was, you--

3245
02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:20.190
MARISHA: It's so good!

3246
02:28:22.081 --> 02:28:23.724
MATT: Actually, order of things, you guys

3247
02:28:23.724 --> 02:28:25.751
marching order would have been here.

3248
02:28:25.751 --> 02:28:29.572
TALIESIN: Try and keep our magic to a minimum.

3249
02:28:29.572 --> 02:28:30.904
TRAVIS: (burps)

3250
02:28:30.904 --> 02:28:33.584
LIAM: Great, so I will be clapping and cheering
for this battle.

3251
02:28:33.584 --> 02:28:34.867
TALIESIN: Mm-hm.
LAURA: Yep.

3252
02:28:35.817 --> 02:28:37.887
All of us, really.

3253
02:28:37.887 --> 02:28:39.764
TRAVIS: I could hand you a weapon.

3254
02:28:39.764 --> 02:28:41.739
SAM: Oh my god!

3255
02:28:41.739 --> 02:28:43.711
LAURA: It is huge!
MATT: Nott is not--

3256
02:28:43.711 --> 02:28:45.819
LAURA: It is huge!
MATT: --visible anymore.

3257
02:28:45.819 --> 02:28:47.611
TRAVIS: What is that?

3258
02:28:48.544 --> 02:28:52.201
What is that?!
(laughter)

3259
02:28:52.201 --> 02:28:55.443
LAURA: Whoa, god!
MATT: 25 to 20.

3260
02:28:55.443 --> 02:28:58.748
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't even roll initiative.
I'm still in shock.

3261
02:28:58.748 --> 02:29:00.169
MARISHA: 24.

3262
02:29:00.169 --> 02:29:01.422
LIAM: 20.

3263
02:29:01.422 --> 02:29:03.473
MATT: All right.

3264
02:29:03.473 --> 02:29:04.681
TALIESIN: Fudge.

3265
02:29:05.986 --> 02:29:07.505
MATT: 20 to 15?

3266
02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:09.087
LAURA: 15.
TRAVIS: 16.

3267
02:29:09.087 --> 02:29:10.087
MATT: All right.

3268
02:29:10.976 --> 02:29:13.280
LAURA: Oh my god.

3269
02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:15.872
MATT: 15 was Jester?
LAURA: Yeah.

3270
02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:20.583
SAM: 12.

3271
02:29:22.745 --> 02:29:24.370
TALIESIN: 12.

3272
02:29:26.607 --> 02:29:27.920
MATT: And Caduceus...

3273
02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:31.420
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
SAM: What the fuck is that thing?

3274
02:29:32.739 --> 02:29:36.372
MATT: Alrighty, Caduceus, you

3275
02:29:36.372 --> 02:29:38.513
with your passive perception...

3276
02:29:39.678 --> 02:29:41.261
LIAM: I would just prefer to take it off my papers.

3277
02:29:41.261 --> 02:29:42.236
TRAVIS: Do you want it?
LIAM: No.

3278
02:29:42.236 --> 02:29:44.025
TRAVIS: You want the whip? You want the dagger?

3279
02:29:44.025 --> 02:29:45.468
LIAM: I don't know.

3280
02:29:45.468 --> 02:29:49.783
I want to use magic.
SAM: (laughs)

3281
02:29:49.783 --> 02:29:53.141
LIAM: I want to use my vast array of spells.

3282
02:29:53.141 --> 02:29:56.058
TRAVIS: Did you crush the pretzel inside?

3283
02:29:57.543 --> 02:29:59.629
MATT: All right, so, top of the round.

3284
02:29:59.629 --> 02:30:01.297
Beauregard, as you watch the

3285
02:30:01.297 --> 02:30:04.247
splash and it rests itself in the water there.

3286
02:30:04.247 --> 02:30:07.379
Itself, its form taking up a large portion of the pond.

3287
02:30:07.379 --> 02:30:11.272
In fact, it may very well have been the base of this pond,

3288
02:30:11.272 --> 02:30:13.617
consume Nott in one bite.

3289
02:30:13.617 --> 02:30:16.450
Nott, you are currently considered

3290
02:30:17.425 --> 02:30:20.258
blind and restrained.
SAM: Sure, sure.

3291
02:30:21.802 --> 02:30:23.694
MATT: What are you doing, Beau?

3292
02:30:23.694 --> 02:30:27.586
(laughter)

3293
02:30:28.801 --> 02:30:32.195
MARISHA: Ah! He ate Nott, and then I'm going to

3294
02:30:32.195 --> 02:30:35.687
flip forward and I am also going to

3295
02:30:36.646 --> 02:30:39.908
skip off of the water and I'm going to come down

3296
02:30:39.908 --> 02:30:44.721
and I'm going to do a front flippy kicky thingy to his face.

3297
02:30:44.721 --> 02:30:46.111
MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check

3298
02:30:46.111 --> 02:30:48.552
trying to avoid the water.
LIAM: That's Krav Maga.

3299
02:30:48.552 --> 02:30:49.442
Kicky thing.

3300
02:30:49.442 --> 02:30:52.717
SAM: (sings with the background music)

3301
02:30:52.717 --> 02:30:54.880
MARISHA: 22.
TALIESIN: Hey!

3302
02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:56.673
MATT: Using your movement to move over, you flip

3303
02:30:56.673 --> 02:30:58.427
and then land right in front of its face,

3304
02:30:58.427 --> 02:30:59.933
which is where you're doing the impact there.

3305
02:30:59.933 --> 02:31:01.141
So go ahead and roll the attacks.
MARISHA: I come down with a

3306
02:31:01.141 --> 02:31:02.672
MARISHA: big slap.

3307
02:31:02.672 --> 02:31:03.772
Pop pop!

3308
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:06.769
Two attacks is

3309
02:31:07.852 --> 02:31:11.311
okay, 23 for the first and 21 for the second.

3310
02:31:11.311 --> 02:31:12.844
MATT: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage.

3311
02:31:12.844 --> 02:31:16.435
MARISHA: I'm going to use my fists here.

3312
02:31:16.435 --> 02:31:18.615
SAM: (sings with background music)

3313
02:31:18.615 --> 02:31:20.042
MARISHA: Okay.

3314
02:31:20.042 --> 02:31:23.999
First attack is 11 damage, Stunning Strike.

3315
02:31:23.999 --> 02:31:25.499
MATT: Stunning Strike!

3316
02:31:27.074 --> 02:31:29.577
That is a 21, unfortunately.

3317
02:31:29.577 --> 02:31:33.044
MARISHA: Jesus, yeah okay, second is

3318
02:31:35.593 --> 02:31:37.239
nine damage.

3319
02:31:37.239 --> 02:31:40.337
MATT: Nine damage, all righty.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

3320
02:31:41.861 --> 02:31:43.844
MATT: That is 18.

3321
02:31:43.844 --> 02:31:46.255
MARISHA: Fuck, his constitution is high.

3322
02:31:46.255 --> 02:31:48.665
MATT: It's a pretty beefy creature.

3323
02:31:48.665 --> 02:31:50.228
Bonus action still.

3324
02:31:50.228 --> 02:31:53.170
MARISHA: And then bonus attaction, bonus attaction!

3325
02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:55.290
MATT: (chuckles)

3326
02:31:55.290 --> 02:31:57.650
MARISHA: I'm going to attack.

3327
02:31:57.650 --> 02:31:58.957
MATT: Regular attack?
MARISHA: Just a regular attack.

3328
02:31:58.957 --> 02:32:00.058
MATT: Go for it, make a third strike.

3329
02:32:00.058 --> 02:32:01.908
MARISHA: Actually, no.

3330
02:32:02.815 --> 02:32:04.541
LAURA: Did you already damage it?

3331
02:32:04.541 --> 02:32:05.707
MARISHA: I did.
LAURA: Okay.

3332
02:32:05.707 --> 02:32:07.148
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

3333
02:32:07.148 --> 02:32:08.973
MATT: Patient Defense, you got it.

3334
02:32:08.973 --> 02:32:11.412
So, (exhales) you go into a defensive stance

3335
02:32:11.412 --> 02:32:13.889
across from this massive creature, which now you see

3336
02:32:13.889 --> 02:32:15.386
as it emerges from the water,

3337
02:32:15.386 --> 02:32:18.518
it's glistening green, leathery slick hide

3338
02:32:18.518 --> 02:32:21.671
almost slimy as the water pours off of it.

3339
02:32:21.671 --> 02:32:24.099
You can see this massive jaw from corner to corner

3340
02:32:24.099 --> 02:32:26.931
is about six feet and at the top of its head

3341
02:32:26.931 --> 02:32:29.406
this rising arm-like protrusion

3342
02:32:29.406 --> 02:32:31.866
ends in three eyestalks that all blink

3343
02:32:31.866 --> 02:32:34.826
with these ghastly looking yellow eyes.

3344
02:32:34.826 --> 02:32:37.078
You see multiple tendrils off of its body

3345
02:32:37.078 --> 02:32:38.876
as its large tongue (slurps)

3346
02:32:38.876 --> 02:32:40.199
thrashes around the outside of its mouth,

3347
02:32:40.199 --> 02:32:42.096
Nott nowhere to be seen within its jaws.

3348
02:32:42.096 --> 02:32:44.208
MARISHA: Can I get an Extract Aspects from that?

3349
02:32:44.208 --> 02:32:45.225
MATT: You did not use your--

3350
02:32:45.225 --> 02:32:46.181
MARISHA: I didn't use it, okay.

3351
02:32:46.181 --> 02:32:47.855
MATT: You used your bonus action to
use your Patient Defense.

3352
02:32:47.855 --> 02:32:49.598
MARISHA: Okay, okay, sorry.

3353
02:32:49.598 --> 02:32:50.687
MATT: Caleb, you're up next.

3354
02:32:50.687 --> 02:32:53.905
LIAM: Caleb is going to back away maybe 20 feet

3355
02:32:53.905 --> 02:32:56.015
sizing up the situation, looking at the beast,

3356
02:32:56.015 --> 02:32:58.161
looking at the little bug motes.

3357
02:32:58.161 --> 02:33:00.571
MATT: Okay, as you move out of its combat range--

3358
02:33:00.571 --> 02:33:02.267
LIAM: Oh.
MATT: --one of its tentacles

3359
02:33:02.267 --> 02:33:05.079
(whooshes) whips towards you as a reaction.

3360
02:33:05.079 --> 02:33:06.649
LIAM: I thought I was far enough away.
TRAVIS: Figuring it out for us.

3361
02:33:06.649 --> 02:33:08.430
MATT: You thought you were, but you're not.

3362
02:33:08.430 --> 02:33:09.605
LAURA: (laughs) But you're not!

3363
02:33:09.605 --> 02:33:12.181
MATT: That's a 15 to hit?

3364
02:33:12.181 --> 02:33:13.063
LIAM: Shield!

3365
02:33:13.063 --> 02:33:15.679
LAURA: Caleb, is that a cantrip?
MATT: All right.

3366
02:33:15.679 --> 02:33:17.446
LIAM: I'm doing it.

3367
02:33:17.446 --> 02:33:19.593
MATT: That deflects the attack.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

3368
02:33:19.593 --> 02:33:22.358
MATT: All the local mites all of a sudden flash and glow,

3369
02:33:22.358 --> 02:33:23.894
nothing yet on that point, but--

3370
02:33:23.894 --> 02:33:26.829
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm looking at the insects as I back up

3371
02:33:26.829 --> 02:33:29.061
and no time to find out like the present

3372
02:33:29.061 --> 02:33:32.334
and I slap bat guano and sulfur together

3373
02:33:32.334 --> 02:33:36.091
(rumbling whooshing) and a massive ball of flame

3374
02:33:36.091 --> 02:33:38.095
appears in my hands and I chuck a Fireball

3375
02:33:38.095 --> 02:33:43.070
through the air and set it off 15 feet up and behind

3376
02:33:44.538 --> 02:33:45.828
Froggy.

3377
02:33:45.828 --> 02:33:46.808
MATT: 15 feet up and behind?

3378
02:33:46.808 --> 02:33:48.466
LIAM: Yeah, so it just hits his backside,

3379
02:33:48.466 --> 02:33:49.733
burns his ass.
MATT: Right there, you mean?

3380
02:33:49.733 --> 02:33:51.162
LIAM: Close enough to him to burn his ass,

3381
02:33:51.162 --> 02:33:52.202
but away from the group.

3382
02:33:52.202 --> 02:33:55.033
MATT: Gotcha, no worries. You release the sphere

3383
02:33:55.033 --> 02:33:58.858
(whooshes, explodes) detonates on the side of the mountain.

3384
02:33:58.858 --> 02:34:01.342
You can see rocks go flying, an area of the tree

3385
02:34:01.342 --> 02:34:02.844
over here suddenly ignites and the tree's

3386
02:34:02.844 --> 02:34:04.518
starting to burn and crumple inward.

3387
02:34:04.518 --> 02:34:08.623
You hear a handful of shrieks (various shrieks)

3388
02:34:08.623 --> 02:34:10.302
as a couple of figures that were apparently

3389
02:34:10.302 --> 02:34:13.630
lurking on this side are going to take some damage.

3390
02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:16.801
So go ahead and roll damage on that.

3391
02:34:16.801 --> 02:34:20.739
Saving throw for him, is a 14, does not make it.

3392
02:34:20.739 --> 02:34:25.731
LIAM: No, 18 fire damage, and here come the bugs.

3393
02:34:29.034 --> 02:34:33.439
MATT: Okay, all right, you see one burning body

3394
02:34:33.439 --> 02:34:35.750
tumble off and hit the ground over here.

3395
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:38.569
A somewhat humanoid, shorter than a normal human,

3396
02:34:38.569 --> 02:34:42.366
but rotund looking frog-like creature.

3397
02:34:42.366 --> 02:34:43.458
LIAM: (croaks)

3398
02:34:43.458 --> 02:34:47.266
MATT: Also, the flames manage to impact

3399
02:34:47.266 --> 02:34:49.789
the large, hulking creature

3400
02:34:49.789 --> 02:34:51.343
and it didn't even attempt to move,

3401
02:34:51.343 --> 02:34:54.317
but it didn't seem to have the impact you were hoping.

3402
02:34:54.317 --> 02:34:56.933
LIAM: Hmm.
LAURA: Okay.

3403
02:34:56.933 --> 02:34:57.992
SAM: Resistant to fire.

3404
02:34:57.992 --> 02:35:00.028
LIAM: That's different than no impact, right?

3405
02:35:00.028 --> 02:35:02.111
MATT: No, it did some damage.

3406
02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:05.526
That's your turn?
LIAM: Yeah, that's my turn.

3407
02:35:05.526 --> 02:35:10.207
MATT: Now, various glowing Scribe Mites in the vicinity

3408
02:35:10.207 --> 02:35:12.703
(whooshes) descend upon Caleb.

3409
02:35:12.703 --> 02:35:15.668
Caleb, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

3410
02:35:15.668 --> 02:35:17.152
TRAVIS: What is <i>this</i> going to do?

3411
02:35:17.152 --> 02:35:18.529
MARISHA: I know!
TRAVIS: Oh god.

3412
02:35:18.529 --> 02:35:19.447
LIAM: Constitution, you say?

3413
02:35:19.447 --> 02:35:20.846
MATT: Correct.

3414
02:35:20.846 --> 02:35:21.687
LIAM: 20.

3415
02:35:21.687 --> 02:35:25.133
MATT: 20, okay, you manage to shrug off

3416
02:35:25.133 --> 02:35:28.993
the majority of the impact, only taking six points

3417
02:35:28.993 --> 02:35:30.564
of lightning damage, but you watch

3418
02:35:30.564 --> 02:35:32.959
as a cloud of 12 of them adhere to him

3419
02:35:32.959 --> 02:35:34.875
and then spark and in doing so

3420
02:35:34.875 --> 02:35:37.367
send a surge of energy through Caleb's body

3421
02:35:37.367 --> 02:35:39.540
past the Shield that he had up,

3422
02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:41.179
and you watch as he shudders for a second

3423
02:35:41.179 --> 02:35:45.121
before they detach and they fade away, seemingly sated.

3424
02:35:45.121 --> 02:35:46.741
More seem to be slowly filling

3425
02:35:46.741 --> 02:35:48.066
the clouded area around you,

3426
02:35:48.066 --> 02:35:52.464
drawn toward the expenditure of arcane spellcraft.

3427
02:35:52.464 --> 02:35:54.287
That finishes their go. Fjord, you're up.

3428
02:35:54.287 --> 02:35:57.816
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will-- oh shit. I'll run forward

3429
02:35:57.816 --> 02:35:59.616
and summon the Star Razor.

3430
02:35:59.616 --> 02:36:00.840
MATT: (whoosh)

3431
02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:04.014
TRAVIS: And I will take two arcing, upward swings

3432
02:36:04.014 --> 02:36:08.006
into the mutant frog fuck.
MATT: All right, you got it.

3433
02:36:08.006 --> 02:36:11.098
Moving up, blade gleaming blue silver

3434
02:36:11.098 --> 02:36:14.431
across its front end, make your strikes.

3435
02:36:15.545 --> 02:36:18.127
TRAVIS: That is a 23 to hit.

3436
02:36:18.127 --> 02:36:20.971
MATT: That definitely hits.
TRAVIS: And the second one is a

3437
02:36:20.971 --> 02:36:23.082
14 to hit.
MATT: That does hit.

3438
02:36:23.082 --> 02:36:24.394
Actually, no, 14 just misses.

3439
02:36:24.394 --> 02:36:26.857
Sorry, just misses.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3440
02:36:30.156 --> 02:36:33.948
That's 13 points of slashing damage,

3441
02:36:33.948 --> 02:36:35.962
sorry, 15 points of slashing damage.

3442
02:36:35.962 --> 02:36:37.975
MATT: 15 points of slashing damage, you got it.

3443
02:36:37.975 --> 02:36:39.725
TRAVIS: And that's it.

3444
02:36:41.445 --> 02:36:43.753
And that is my turn. I'll stay there.

3445
02:36:43.753 --> 02:36:46.070
Oh no, no no no (scats).

3446
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:48.828
(group scats along)

3447
02:36:48.828 --> 02:36:50.407
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I will say

3448
02:36:50.407 --> 02:36:53.730
the command word Gallas Var and cause it to

3449
02:36:53.730 --> 02:36:56.704
ignite in that blue light.

3450
02:36:56.704 --> 02:37:00.313
MATT: Alrighty, so now you watch the blade suddenly

3451
02:37:00.313 --> 02:37:03.772
burst into vibrant blue-white radiant energy,

3452
02:37:03.772 --> 02:37:05.449
the runes along its blade lighting up

3453
02:37:05.449 --> 02:37:07.037
(skittering sound) along its edge

3454
02:37:07.037 --> 02:37:08.768
until the tip seems to gleam,

3455
02:37:08.768 --> 02:37:11.432
releasing the faint bit of energy it released

3456
02:37:11.432 --> 02:37:13.846
as it was summoned and invoked.

3457
02:37:13.846 --> 02:37:15.825
The area around Fjord is now lit up.

3458
02:37:15.825 --> 02:37:18.247
There's this radial, faint glow,

3459
02:37:18.247 --> 02:37:21.184
like a blue torchlight around him.

3460
02:37:21.184 --> 02:37:23.737
That finishes Fjord's turn. Jester, you're up.

3461
02:37:23.737 --> 02:37:28.045
LAURA: Okay, as an action, I'm going to

3462
02:37:28.045 --> 02:37:31.152
Channel Divinity that I hope is not like magic,

3463
02:37:31.152 --> 02:37:35.369
and I'm going to cast Invoke Duplicity.

3464
02:37:35.369 --> 02:37:36.998
MATT: Okay.

3465
02:37:36.998 --> 02:37:39.374
TRAVIS: Gonna find out!
MATT: Where you want to place...?

3466
02:37:39.374 --> 02:37:43.196
LAURA: I'm going to send her around
to the backside of-- oops.

3467
02:37:43.196 --> 02:37:44.928
MATT: It's okay.
LAURA: Of the frog.

3468
02:37:44.928 --> 02:37:46.035
Like around there.

3469
02:37:46.035 --> 02:37:47.714
MATT: Like dancing on the surface of the water?

3470
02:37:47.714 --> 02:37:50.120
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

3471
02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:52.620
LAURA: And then as my bonus action,

3472
02:37:55.348 --> 02:37:57.191
after seeing what happened to Caleb,

3473
02:37:57.191 --> 02:38:00.229
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon at second level.

3474
02:38:00.229 --> 02:38:02.062
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Second level!

3475
02:38:03.922 --> 02:38:05.712
LAURA: And I'm going to cast it right next to him

3476
02:38:05.712 --> 02:38:06.991
and he's going to slam the--

3477
02:38:06.991 --> 02:38:08.915
MATT: Which side of him do you want it to be?

3478
02:38:08.915 --> 02:38:11.772
LAURA: On the outside, yeah, yeah.
MATT: Right there?

3479
02:38:11.772 --> 02:38:14.746
LAURA: It's going to try to smack him upside the eyeballs

3480
02:38:14.746 --> 02:38:16.755
on top of his head.
MATT: You got it.

3481
02:38:16.755 --> 02:38:18.938
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Oh boy, oh boy.

3482
02:38:21.161 --> 02:38:24.385
MATT: The mites are gathering in your direction.

3483
02:38:24.385 --> 02:38:26.262
We'll come to that later.
LAURA: Okay.

3484
02:38:26.262 --> 02:38:28.222
That would be a 20 to hit.

3485
02:38:28.222 --> 02:38:31.222
MATT: 20 hits, go ahead and roll damage.
LAURA: Okay.

3486
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:40.671
LAURA: 11 points of damage.
MATT: 11 points of damage, nice.

3487
02:38:40.671 --> 02:38:42.539
LIAM: Hey, remember when you were outside the monster?

3488
02:38:42.539 --> 02:38:44.956
SAM: Nope.
MATT: (laughs)

3489
02:38:44.956 --> 02:38:46.347
So

3490
02:38:47.439 --> 02:38:49.351
after the

3491
02:38:49.351 --> 02:38:51.821
duplicate of Jester appears on the opposite side,

3492
02:38:51.821 --> 02:38:53.414
you see one of the eyestalks (slurps)

3493
02:38:53.414 --> 02:38:55.348
curl over and glance in her direction,

3494
02:38:55.348 --> 02:38:56.565
the other two still facing forward

3495
02:38:56.565 --> 02:38:57.836
towards the rest of the group.

3496
02:38:57.836 --> 02:39:00.723
As she lands, the swirl of divine energy

3497
02:39:00.723 --> 02:39:02.999
summons the lollipop in the air

3498
02:39:02.999 --> 02:39:05.180
as it, whack, slams into its blubbery side.

3499
02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:06.906
(thud of impact) (croak)

3500
02:39:06.906 --> 02:39:09.523
LAURA: And I can make it with my duplicate

3501
02:39:09.523 --> 02:39:13.005
like any of my spells are coming from her.

3502
02:39:13.005 --> 02:39:15.034
MATT: That's why it's eye is turned toward it.

3503
02:39:15.034 --> 02:39:18.180
LAURA: So I'm hoping that the casting of the spell

3504
02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:21.156
is centered on her instead of me. That's the goal.

3505
02:39:21.156 --> 02:39:23.324
MATT: That's the goal. All right,
that finishes Jester's turn.

3506
02:39:23.324 --> 02:39:25.807
It's now the creature's turn.

3507
02:39:25.807 --> 02:39:27.323
TRAVIS: What the fuck is this thing?
TALIESIN: That's cool.

3508
02:39:27.323 --> 02:39:29.259
LIAM: (croaks)

3509
02:39:29.259 --> 02:39:33.592
MATT: It's going to make two tentacle strikes.

3510
02:39:36.266 --> 02:39:40.186
One of its tentacles is going to reach out and slap

3511
02:39:40.186 --> 02:39:41.818
actually, one of them's going to go forward

3512
02:39:41.818 --> 02:39:43.307
towards you, Fjord, and the other one's

3513
02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:45.890
going to go against Beauregard.

3514
02:39:48.546 --> 02:39:52.340
Against Fjord, that is a 25 to hit.

3515
02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:55.275
TRAVIS: Whoa. That hits.
MATT: Beauregard's a 21.

3516
02:39:55.275 --> 02:39:57.001
MARISHA: Disadvantage?

3517
02:39:57.001 --> 02:39:59.776
MATT: Oh that's right, because you have...

3518
02:39:59.776 --> 02:40:01.872
That was a 25, so yeah, it still hit, 21.

3519
02:40:01.872 --> 02:40:03.290
Does that hit?
MARISHA: Fuck, yes.

3520
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:04.632
MATT: All right, so two of the tentacles

3521
02:40:04.632 --> 02:40:08.265
(whooshing) whip each of you.

3522
02:40:09.548 --> 02:40:12.073
That'll put it at...

3523
02:40:15.242 --> 02:40:16.450
MATT: Oh!

3524
02:40:17.475 --> 02:40:18.899
LAURA: He made a "oh" sound.

3525
02:40:18.899 --> 02:40:22.636
MATT: 24 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Fjord.

3526
02:40:22.636 --> 02:40:24.842
LAURA: Halved because you're raging.

3527
02:40:24.842 --> 02:40:27.092
(laughter)

3528
02:40:28.355 --> 02:40:30.369
MATT: 26 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Beauregard.

3529
02:40:30.369 --> 02:40:31.468
SAM: Damn!

3530
02:40:31.468 --> 02:40:33.318
TRAVIS: Um, Matt...
MATT: Two tentacles!

3531
02:40:33.318 --> 02:40:36.732
TRAVIS: When he hits me, the sword will pulse blue

3532
02:40:36.732 --> 02:40:40.299
and he will take three points of radiant damage.

3533
02:40:41.364 --> 02:40:43.305
LAURA: Nice.
SAM: Eat it.

3534
02:40:44.582 --> 02:40:46.300
MATT: As the tentacle slaps on the side of you,

3535
02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:48.403
you see this blue flash of light,

3536
02:40:48.403 --> 02:40:50.941
and it retracts with this burn scorching mark

3537
02:40:50.941 --> 02:40:53.482
across the side of the tip.

3538
02:40:53.482 --> 02:40:55.968
It adjusts within the pool.

3539
02:40:55.968 --> 02:40:57.927
You're only seeing the upper half of its body.

3540
02:40:57.927 --> 02:41:01.714
(slurps) Moves a bit, its legs kicking the water,

3541
02:41:01.714 --> 02:41:03.810
splashing around it as it shifts,

3542
02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:08.533
and it sees Caduceus and Caleb over there rushing away.

3543
02:41:08.533 --> 02:41:10.495
It's going to open its mouth (growls)

3544
02:41:10.495 --> 02:41:11.806
and the tongue (whoosh)

3545
02:41:11.806 --> 02:41:15.389
is going to whip out towards you, Caduceus.

3546
02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:19.041
Oh actually, you have to make a strength saving throw.

3547
02:41:19.041 --> 02:41:20.161
TALIESIN: I have to make a strength saving throw?

3548
02:41:20.161 --> 02:41:23.601
LAURA: What, is he going to grab you with his tongue?

3549
02:41:23.601 --> 02:41:26.293
TRAVIS: That seems unfair.
SAM: Come on in!

3550
02:41:26.293 --> 02:41:28.324
TALIESIN: Nope!

3551
02:41:28.324 --> 02:41:31.333
MATT: Slaps into you and it doesn't hurt so much

3552
02:41:31.333 --> 02:41:33.513
as just catches you off guard,

3553
02:41:33.513 --> 02:41:35.624
but the tongue is adhered to your chest armor

3554
02:41:35.624 --> 02:41:38.641
and it (whooshes) yanks you (whooshes)

3555
02:41:38.641 --> 02:41:40.725
into the water, sploosh, next to it

3556
02:41:40.725 --> 02:41:41.673
and in towards its mouth.

3557
02:41:41.673 --> 02:41:43.290
It gets a free bite attack against you.

3558
02:41:43.290 --> 02:41:45.372
TALIESIN: That's fine.
MATT: As a bonus action.

3559
02:41:45.372 --> 02:41:48.603
LAURA: This guy's hard.
MATT: That's a 28 to hit.

3560
02:41:48.603 --> 02:41:52.699
TALIESIN: A 28 to hit!? Somehow that misses--
just kidding, that hits.

3561
02:41:52.699 --> 02:41:55.750
MATT: Rolled really high.
TALIESIN: My god, man.

3562
02:41:55.750 --> 02:42:00.273
TRAVIS: Look at that waterfall!
LAURA: Yeah, but look at that waterfall.

3563
02:42:00.273 --> 02:42:04.267
MATT: 25 points of piercing damage, and Caduceus

3564
02:42:04.267 --> 02:42:07.525
(gulps) is swallowed.

3565
02:42:07.525 --> 02:42:10.085
LAURA: Oh god, Caduceus is swallowed, too?!

3566
02:42:10.085 --> 02:42:11.767
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Yes.

3567
02:42:11.767 --> 02:42:14.597
SAM: Matt, did you add the cotton to the waterfall?

3568
02:42:14.597 --> 02:42:16.179
MATT: No, it comes with that.

3569
02:42:17.279 --> 02:42:19.756
TRAVIS: It's fucking gorgeous.

3570
02:42:19.756 --> 02:42:21.215
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

3571
02:42:21.215 --> 02:42:24.779
MATT: Also, Nott, you are in a dark, enclosed space

3572
02:42:24.779 --> 02:42:27.289
and suffer only four points of acid damage,

3573
02:42:27.289 --> 02:42:29.370
as you are being digested within its belly.

3574
02:42:29.370 --> 02:42:31.242
SAM: It's safer in here than out there.

3575
02:42:31.242 --> 02:42:34.128
(laughter)

3576
02:42:34.128 --> 02:42:35.917
MARISHA: That's true!

3577
02:42:35.917 --> 02:42:37.781
MATT: And right as the acid burns into you,

3578
02:42:37.781 --> 02:42:39.346
and you're starting to get yourself ready,

3579
02:42:39.346 --> 02:42:41.143
(slamming sound) something heavy lands on you.

3580
02:42:41.143 --> 02:42:43.783
TALIESIN: Sorry!
(laughter)

3581
02:42:43.783 --> 02:42:45.826
SAM: (screams)

3582
02:42:45.826 --> 02:42:46.898
MATT: It's now both of your guys turn!

3583
02:42:46.898 --> 02:42:51.227
(laughter)
TALIESIN: You first, please.

3584
02:42:51.227 --> 02:42:53.280
SAM: I'm going to trust that you'll get us out of here.

3585
02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:55.665
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's adorable.
SAM: I assume I'm too restrained

3586
02:42:55.665 --> 02:42:58.817
to get a weapon out or anything.

3587
02:42:58.817 --> 02:43:00.452
MATT: You can get a weapon out if you want to.

3588
02:43:00.452 --> 02:43:01.994
You can't move, your speed is zero--

3589
02:43:01.994 --> 02:43:02.827
SAM: Like a crossbow?

3590
02:43:02.827 --> 02:43:03.660
MATT: Yeah!
TRAVIS: Come on, you've been

3591
02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:07.345
in an anus before.
MATT: You can pull an object out,

3592
02:43:07.345 --> 02:43:09.600
but any attacks or ability checks are at disadvantage

3593
02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:11.666
and your speed is zero.

3594
02:43:11.666 --> 02:43:15.317
SAM: Okay, I will jimmy the crossbow out

3595
02:43:15.317 --> 02:43:18.001
and just shoot straight down.

3596
02:43:18.001 --> 02:43:20.079
MATT: Okay, you're just hoping to aim for somewhere

3597
02:43:20.079 --> 02:43:21.959
sensitive in its anatomy.
SAM: Yeah!

3598
02:43:21.959 --> 02:43:23.361
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack roll with disadvantage.

3599
02:43:23.361 --> 02:43:24.935
SAM: Disadvants.
MATT: Yes.

3600
02:43:27.072 --> 02:43:31.169
SAM: 11 and a 12, both plus, this is the crossbow, right,

3601
02:43:31.169 --> 02:43:33.031
so plus 10, so 21.

3602
02:43:33.031 --> 02:43:34.948
MATT: That does hit.
SAM: Nice!

3603
02:43:37.176 --> 02:43:38.616
SAM: This is tricky.
MATT: Well, no,

3604
02:43:38.616 --> 02:43:42.169
it's either with advantage or if you have a friend

3605
02:43:42.169 --> 02:43:45.938
who's adjacent to it and so it is technically distracted.

3606
02:43:45.938 --> 02:43:47.229
SAM: Sneak attack damage?!

3607
02:43:47.229 --> 02:43:50.638
MATT: Honestly, I'd say yes

3608
02:43:50.638 --> 02:43:52.457
because there's no armor protecting its hide.

3609
02:43:52.457 --> 02:43:54.191
You are shooting it from the inside of its body,

3610
02:43:54.191 --> 02:43:55.841
so yeah.
SAM: Okay.

3611
02:43:57.085 --> 02:44:00.245
Then I will hit it with six, seven, eight,

3612
02:44:00.245 --> 02:44:01.445
oh my god,

3613
02:44:04.276 --> 02:44:07.176
26 points of piercing damage.

3614
02:44:08.169 --> 02:44:12.560
Plus I'll add the extra plus 10 of Fury of the Small,

3615
02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:15.085
36 damage.
MATT: 36 points of damage.

3616
02:44:15.085 --> 02:44:16.598
As you reach down and (whooshes)

3617
02:44:16.598 --> 02:44:19.287
and you hear the crossbow (pings)

3618
02:44:19.287 --> 02:44:21.901
release, (thuds) of impact and suddenly

3619
02:44:21.901 --> 02:44:25.032
(growling) it begins to quake from the inside.

3620
02:44:25.032 --> 02:44:26.463
TRAVIS: Why don't we just all get swallowed?

3621
02:44:26.463 --> 02:44:27.724
(laughter)

3622
02:44:27.724 --> 02:44:29.259
TRAVIS: I'm next, take me!

3623
02:44:29.259 --> 02:44:30.749
MARISHA: Fight this thing from the inside out.

3624
02:44:30.749 --> 02:44:33.164
LIAM: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!

3625
02:44:33.164 --> 02:44:35.325
MATT: It does manage to keep you down though.

3626
02:44:35.325 --> 02:44:36.816
SAM: Damn.
LAURA: Aww!

3627
02:44:37.991 --> 02:44:41.415
MATT: Just barely, like on the dot (laughs).

3628
02:44:41.415 --> 02:44:43.846
So you guys are both still kept inside,

3629
02:44:43.846 --> 02:44:46.719
its muscles are crushing and restraining you both.

3630
02:44:46.719 --> 02:44:48.696
The acid's beginning to burn and

3631
02:44:48.696 --> 02:44:51.136
tear away at the flesh and skin.

3632
02:44:51.136 --> 02:44:52.540
Rest of your turn?

3633
02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:56.610
SAM: I mean, I'm going to assume I cannot reload

3634
02:44:56.610 --> 02:44:58.821
the thing in here.

3635
02:44:58.821 --> 02:45:02.824
SAM: It's all quick motion. You're not like--

3636
02:45:02.824 --> 02:45:04.229
you're not tied,
LAURA: You're in a stomach.

3637
02:45:04.229 --> 02:45:06.029
MATT: You're just pressed in.
LAURA: You're not like you were in the dragon.

3638
02:45:06.029 --> 02:45:09.302
SAM: I can reload? All right, bonus action shoot again!

3639
02:45:11.436 --> 02:45:12.597
MATT: Still disadvantage on the strike, though.

3640
02:45:12.597 --> 02:45:14.864
SAM: Yes, oh, one and a two.

3641
02:45:14.864 --> 02:45:16.613
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Miss.

3642
02:45:16.613 --> 02:45:19.348
MATT: So roll again, because on a 1, with disadvantage.

3643
02:45:19.348 --> 02:45:22.209
SAM: Oh, you're right.
MATT: It attacks you.

3644
02:45:22.209 --> 02:45:24.724
So in trying to get it situated on the inside,

3645
02:45:24.724 --> 02:45:27.934
unknowingly you set the crossbow backwards and fire.

3646
02:45:27.934 --> 02:45:31.731
Make an attack roll against yourself.

3647
02:45:31.731 --> 02:45:34.240
Attack rolls against you have advantage, technically,

3648
02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:35.860
but you have disadvantage, so no, it's just a straight roll.

3649
02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:38.875
SAM: Well, it was a one, so I get one point of damage.

3650
02:45:38.875 --> 02:45:41.699
LAURA: Oh that's good, it was a little, teeny.

3651
02:45:41.699 --> 02:45:45.610
MATT: Yeah, it grazes you off the shoulder, like, ah shit.

3652
02:45:45.610 --> 02:45:47.365
SAM: Maybe I hit Caduceus.

3653
02:45:47.365 --> 02:45:49.198
MATT: Caduceus, your turn.

3654
02:45:50.475 --> 02:45:52.058
TALIESIN: Well, this sucks.

3655
02:45:53.176 --> 02:45:55.018
LAURA: I bet if you do magic from the inside--

3656
02:45:55.018 --> 02:45:56.445
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!
TALIESIN: I know.

3657
02:45:56.445 --> 02:45:57.753
LAURA: They can't attack you.

3658
02:45:57.753 --> 02:45:59.711
TRAVIS: Or attack the frog!

3659
02:46:01.501 --> 02:46:05.543
TALIESIN: Just for fun, since I'm stuck in here,
can I cast a spell?

3660
02:46:05.543 --> 02:46:08.918
Actually, there's no movement. This is verbal and somatic.

3661
02:46:08.918 --> 02:46:10.997
There is no actual movement to this spell, so this is--

3662
02:46:10.997 --> 02:46:12.405
MATT: There's still motion, you can still move

3663
02:46:12.405 --> 02:46:13.793
on the inside.

3664
02:46:13.793 --> 02:46:15.703
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Ray of Enfeeblement.

3665
02:46:15.703 --> 02:46:18.580
LIAM: What does the frog say?
SAM: (singing "What Does the Fox Say")

3666
02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:20.206
MATT: You begin muttering your incantation

3667
02:46:20.206 --> 02:46:22.102
from underneath, the spell release,

3668
02:46:22.102 --> 02:46:23.483
what's it have to roll?

3669
02:46:23.483 --> 02:46:25.394
TALIESIN: It's a constitution save.

3670
02:46:25.394 --> 02:46:27.099
MATT: All right.

3671
02:46:27.099 --> 02:46:31.106
Natural one.
(cheering)

3672
02:46:31.106 --> 02:46:33.994
MATT: Even with it's high constitution,
natural one, so it fails.

3673
02:46:33.994 --> 02:46:37.207
It is enfeebled.
TALIESIN: Yep.

3674
02:46:37.207 --> 02:46:38.573
SAM: Ribbit, ribbit, motherfucker!

3675
02:46:38.573 --> 02:46:40.203
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to drop the spell.

3676
02:46:40.203 --> 02:46:41.282
It stays up even after I drop it

3677
02:46:41.282 --> 02:46:43.799
because it's an effect, right?

3678
02:46:43.799 --> 02:46:44.860
No, no, no I have to hold it.

3679
02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:45.693
MATT: No, it says concentration.

3680
02:46:45.693 --> 02:46:47.045
TALIESIN: So I have to hold it.

3681
02:46:47.045 --> 02:46:49.868
MATT: You do lose your advantage on your--

3682
02:46:49.868 --> 02:46:52.059
TALIESIN: Intelligence checks, big deal.

3683
02:46:52.059 --> 02:46:53.368
MATT: It's a frog.

3684
02:46:55.127 --> 02:46:56.424
TALIESIN: And then I have a bonus action,

3685
02:46:56.424 --> 02:47:01.007
there's not much I can do with my bonus action, really.

3686
02:47:03.258 --> 02:47:06.187
I don't really have anything to do with a bonus action, so.

3687
02:47:06.187 --> 02:47:07.220
MATT: All right, that ends your turn.

3688
02:47:07.220 --> 02:47:09.004
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: Okay.

3689
02:47:09.004 --> 02:47:10.496
You watch as a series of the mites

3690
02:47:10.496 --> 02:47:13.169
begin to suddenly shift and gravitate towards the creature.

3691
02:47:13.169 --> 02:47:16.010
TRAVIS: No fucking way.

3692
02:47:16.010 --> 02:47:18.538
MARISHA: What happens if you get electrocuted on the inside?

3693
02:47:18.538 --> 02:47:21.779
MATT: Now, (croaking)

3694
02:47:21.779 --> 02:47:25.279
a bunch of similarly sized

3695
02:47:25.279 --> 02:47:27.851
frog-like humanoids with spears and shields and clubs

3696
02:47:27.851 --> 02:47:30.663
start rushing out of the nearby trees and bushes.

3697
02:47:30.663 --> 02:47:33.016
Apparently drawn by the croaks of this

3698
02:47:33.016 --> 02:47:36.499
larger beast and slowly hunting you

3699
02:47:36.499 --> 02:47:39.362
from the distant sides of this jungle.

3700
02:47:39.362 --> 02:47:40.670
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3701
02:47:43.378 --> 02:47:45.353
MATT: Oh god!

3702
02:47:45.353 --> 02:47:48.024
TRAVIS: Can we tell how deep that pool of water is?

3703
02:47:48.024 --> 02:47:50.283
It's shallow-ish, right?

3704
02:47:50.283 --> 02:47:53.799
MATT: Elements of it are about 10-15 at the very edge,

3705
02:47:53.799 --> 02:47:57.132
and then it dips down to 30 or 40 below.

3706
02:47:59.408 --> 02:48:01.106
SAM: What is that?

3707
02:48:01.106 --> 02:48:03.054
LAURA: Oh god, there are so many of them.

3708
02:48:03.054 --> 02:48:05.139
SAM: How do we get out of here?

3709
02:48:07.522 --> 02:48:08.833
TRAVIS: Come at me!

3710
02:48:08.833 --> 02:48:11.035
TALIESIN: I got two more and then we're done.

3711
02:48:11.035 --> 02:48:13.071
MATT: Bunch of them died over here from the Fireball,

3712
02:48:13.071 --> 02:48:14.836
before they even had a chance.

3713
02:48:14.836 --> 02:48:16.747
SAM: Those are ugly motherfuckers.

3714
02:48:16.747 --> 02:48:18.872
MATT: This is going to rush around, 10, 15, 20

3715
02:48:18.872 --> 02:48:23.872
to Caleb there, oh god, the trees, the trees keep falling.

3716
02:48:25.515 --> 02:48:30.503
SAM: ♪ The trees keep falling down, down, down ♪

3717
02:48:31.345 --> 02:48:35.055
MATT: (counting) into a standing leap and

3718
02:48:35.055 --> 02:48:37.862
(croaks) jumps without having to lose any movement

3719
02:48:37.862 --> 02:48:39.750
and lands right next to Fjord

3720
02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:42.710
while this one here is going to

3721
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:46.280
throw a spear towards you, Fjord.

3722
02:48:47.188 --> 02:48:49.240
The spear...

3723
02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:51.733
That's a 12.
TRAVIS: Misses.

3724
02:48:51.733 --> 02:48:53.246
MATT: Just (whooshes), no issue.

3725
02:48:53.246 --> 02:48:54.580
The one that rushed up towards you

3726
02:48:54.580 --> 02:48:57.538
is going to attempt to make two melee attacks,

3727
02:48:57.538 --> 02:48:59.932
one with its spear, one with its bite.

3728
02:48:59.932 --> 02:49:01.878
Spear attack against you,

3729
02:49:01.878 --> 02:49:03.494
15.

3730
02:49:03.494 --> 02:49:04.327
TRAVIS: Misses!

3731
02:49:04.327 --> 02:49:06.392
MATT: The spear glances off and now it's

3732
02:49:06.392 --> 02:49:08.689
up in your face and you can see the giant mouth

3733
02:49:08.689 --> 02:49:10.927
the bullfroggy mouth open with sharp, jagged teeth,

3734
02:49:10.927 --> 02:49:12.775
as it's going to attempt to bite you.

3735
02:49:12.775 --> 02:49:16.450
That is going to be a 21.
TRAVIS: Does hit.

3736
02:49:16.450 --> 02:49:18.735
Use your words!

3737
02:49:18.735 --> 02:49:20.599
MATT: You suffer, ooh, seven points of piercing damage

3738
02:49:20.599 --> 02:49:24.276
as it bites on to your face.
TRAVIS: He will take...

3739
02:49:24.276 --> 02:49:26.687
one point of radiant damage.

3740
02:49:26.687 --> 02:49:28.341
MATT: There you go.

3741
02:49:28.341 --> 02:49:30.230
That would have been five points of damage.

3742
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:31.313
TRAVIS: You got it.

3743
02:49:32.371 --> 02:49:34.516
MATT: The two against you, Caleb,

3744
02:49:34.516 --> 02:49:36.747
both making a spear strike against you.

3745
02:49:36.747 --> 02:49:38.738
You still have your high AC.

3746
02:49:38.738 --> 02:49:39.677
LIAM: Because it's the same round.

3747
02:49:39.677 --> 02:49:41.889
MATT: Shield lasts until the next round.

3748
02:49:41.889 --> 02:49:44.356
They got 21 and a 20.

3749
02:49:44.356 --> 02:49:45.574
LIAM: Both hit.
MATT: Both hit?

3750
02:49:45.574 --> 02:49:47.423
Oh wow, even with the--

3751
02:49:47.423 --> 02:49:49.683
LIAM: Yeah, only to 19 with Shield.

3752
02:49:49.683 --> 02:49:51.409
MATT: Fair enough.
SAM: N-n-n-n-nineteen.

3753
02:49:51.409 --> 02:49:53.551
MATT: So you suffer...

3754
02:49:58.055 --> 02:50:00.075
16 points of piercing damage from both strikes

3755
02:50:00.075 --> 02:50:02.792
as you get speared from both sides.

3756
02:50:02.792 --> 02:50:04.816
And they're both going to attempt
to make a bite attack on you.

3757
02:50:04.816 --> 02:50:06.306
LIAM: Oh, <i>Gott</i>.

3758
02:50:06.306 --> 02:50:08.114
MATT: That's going to be a

3759
02:50:08.114 --> 02:50:11.679
12 and a 14, so those both miss you.

3760
02:50:11.679 --> 02:50:13.847
The spears stab, stab at you from each side

3761
02:50:13.847 --> 02:50:14.941
and as they both push it in

3762
02:50:14.941 --> 02:50:18.219
you manage to shove them over off to the side

3763
02:50:18.219 --> 02:50:22.109
and they can't find purchase with their teeth.

3764
02:50:22.109 --> 02:50:24.920
There is the one now that's going to be on this side,

3765
02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:27.750
throwing a spear at the illusionary Jester.

3766
02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:30.281
LAURA: (evil laugh)
MATT: Disappears into the waterfall.

3767
02:50:30.281 --> 02:50:32.636
LAURA: Eat shit, frog person.

3768
02:50:32.636 --> 02:50:35.016
MATT: The one back there is going to
attempt to throw a spear at

3769
02:50:35.016 --> 02:50:38.901
main Jester. That's a 22 to hit.

3770
02:50:38.901 --> 02:50:39.734
LAURA: Ow.

3771
02:50:42.172 --> 02:50:44.897
MATT: And with that, you suffer

3772
02:50:44.897 --> 02:50:46.980
four points of piercing damage.

3773
02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:48.955
LAURA: Okay, do I need to roll a constitution--

3774
02:50:48.955 --> 02:50:50.139
MATT: You do.

3775
02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:51.602
Well no, for Spiritual Weapon you do not.

3776
02:50:51.602 --> 02:50:55.574
LAURA: Yeah, it's not concentration,
but the Invoke Duplicity is.

3777
02:50:55.574 --> 02:50:56.784
MATT: Technically, it's concentrated, so yeah,

3778
02:50:56.784 --> 02:50:58.476
roll a constitution saving throw

3779
02:50:58.476 --> 02:50:59.726
to maintain it.

3780
02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:03.338
LAURA: Five, oh, and I took four,

3781
02:51:03.338 --> 02:51:05.000
no, how much did I take?
SAM: Four damage.

3782
02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:05.961
MATT: What's your total with your

3783
02:51:05.961 --> 02:51:08.209
constitution saving throw?

3784
02:51:08.209 --> 02:51:10.870
LAURA: No, it's five with my consti--

3785
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:14.401
MATT: It's a 10 DC base or half the
damage, whichever's higher.

3786
02:51:14.401 --> 02:51:17.066
The duplicity vanishes.

3787
02:51:17.066 --> 02:51:19.320
The one that threw the spear and missed it

3788
02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:21.265
just starts celebrating (happy croaks).

3789
02:51:21.265 --> 02:51:23.889
Thinking he killed it, he's so excited.

3790
02:51:23.889 --> 02:51:25.412
The eyestalk that was behind (slurps)

3791
02:51:25.412 --> 02:51:27.478
wrenches back forward in your direction.

3792
02:51:27.478 --> 02:51:28.653
That brings us to the top of the round.

3793
02:51:28.653 --> 02:51:29.867
Beauregard, you are up.

3794
02:51:29.867 --> 02:51:33.617
MARISHA: I'm going to keep whaling on this froggy frog!

3795
02:51:34.472 --> 02:51:37.742
I'm going to go whack, whack right in his gut

3796
02:51:37.742 --> 02:51:40.246
and be like, "Puke, dammit!"

3797
02:51:40.246 --> 02:51:44.057
MATT: (laughs) Alrighty.

3798
02:51:44.057 --> 02:51:46.147
MARISHA: Two attacks back to back here.

3799
02:51:46.147 --> 02:51:49.939
Okay, yeah, 25 and 23.
MATT: Both hit.

3800
02:51:52.515 --> 02:51:57.334
MARISHA: 10 damage and 11 damage, so 21 damage total.

3801
02:51:57.334 --> 02:51:59.402
MATT: (impacts) Both fists.

3802
02:51:59.402 --> 02:52:02.072
It's like hitting the side of a giant whale.

3803
02:52:02.072 --> 02:52:05.207
Every impact, there is give, but there's so much

3804
02:52:05.207 --> 02:52:07.183
weight and heft behind its blubbery mass

3805
02:52:07.183 --> 02:52:09.388
that it almost hurts your hand with each impact.

3806
02:52:09.388 --> 02:52:10.821
But it's doing damage, and you can see it

3807
02:52:10.821 --> 02:52:13.185
(croaking)
(slurping)

3808
02:52:13.185 --> 02:52:16.307
reacting to each hit.
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows?

3809
02:52:16.307 --> 02:52:18.022
MATT: Go for it, two more strikes.

3810
02:52:18.022 --> 02:52:19.514
MARISHA: Pop, pop!

3811
02:52:20.446 --> 02:52:23.390
Beau, that's bullshit.
TRAVIS: Did you say your own name?

3812
02:52:23.390 --> 02:52:26.601
Beau?
LIAM: Fo' sho.

3813
02:52:26.601 --> 02:52:28.451
MARISHA: 15 and 12.

3814
02:52:29.466 --> 02:52:32.533
MATT: 15 hits, 12 does not.
MARISHA: Okay, perfect.

3815
02:52:33.995 --> 02:52:38.995
God, seven damage and (snaps) gimme that,

3816
02:52:40.393 --> 02:52:41.522
gimme them deets.

3817
02:52:41.522 --> 02:52:42.749
MATT: Stunning Strike?
MARISHA: Extract Aspects.

3818
02:52:42.749 --> 02:52:44.207
MATT: Oh, Extract Aspects?
MARISHA: Yes.

3819
02:52:44.207 --> 02:52:47.716
MATT: Alrighty. As you draw--

3820
02:52:47.716 --> 02:52:49.090
MATT: After the impacts of its body

3821
02:52:49.090 --> 02:52:52.163
begin to align your ki with the structure of its body

3822
02:52:52.163 --> 02:52:54.147
and as you pull your way back for that final hit

3823
02:52:54.147 --> 02:52:57.433
and impact it, you watch the ray of the

3824
02:52:57.433 --> 02:52:59.558
force of the impact blubber off of it

3825
02:52:59.558 --> 02:53:03.624
like a ripple effect of water, Jurassic Park style.

3826
02:53:03.624 --> 02:53:06.474
As you pull back, you realize it is resistant

3827
02:53:06.474 --> 02:53:08.620
to fire and lightning.

3828
02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:10.515
MARISHA: Fire and lightning.

3829
02:53:10.515 --> 02:53:13.479
Okay, I shout that out to the group.

3830
02:53:13.479 --> 02:53:15.520
Avoid fire and lightning! Sorry, Caleb.

3831
02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:17.463
TRAVIS: We should avoid fire and lightning?

3832
02:53:17.463 --> 02:53:20.266
MARISHA: Yeah, he's immune, or resistant
to fire and lightning.

3833
02:53:20.266 --> 02:53:22.766
TRAVIS: He's got fire and lightning!

3834
02:53:24.392 --> 02:53:26.713
MATT: Okay, that ends Beau's turn. Caleb, you're up.

3835
02:53:26.713 --> 02:53:29.829
LIAM: I hear Beauregard shout not to use fire,

3836
02:53:29.829 --> 02:53:32.490
and to myself I mutter panickedly: Oh, tough titty.

3837
02:53:32.490 --> 02:53:35.100
And I reach my hands into my bag,

3838
02:53:35.100 --> 02:53:37.363
fingers going into a cat's cradle

3839
02:53:37.363 --> 02:53:41.154
crusted over in phosphorus, which I
slam down onto the ground

3840
02:53:41.154 --> 02:53:44.063
and cast Widogast's Web of Fire.

3841
02:53:44.063 --> 02:53:46.668
A ring of flames goes (violently whooshes)

3842
02:53:46.668 --> 02:53:51.473
around Caleb and five chains of fire streak out

3843
02:53:51.473 --> 02:53:53.158
at different enemies on the ground,

3844
02:53:53.158 --> 02:53:55.484
the two frogmen next to me,

3845
02:53:55.484 --> 02:53:57.501
the one in the distance over there,

3846
02:53:57.501 --> 02:54:01.204
two come around this way, one to hit frogman there

3847
02:54:01.204 --> 02:54:03.299
and one to hit the big.
MATT: Alrighty.

3848
02:54:03.299 --> 02:54:04.882
SAM: Whoa!
LAURA: Holy shit.

3849
02:54:05.776 --> 02:54:08.457
MATT: It's a dexterity saving throw on that one?
LIAM: Yeah.

3850
02:54:09.382 --> 02:54:10.771
MATT: Roll damage first.
TRAVIS: Those fireflies are coming.

3851
02:54:10.771 --> 02:54:15.188
MARISHA: Gonna be pissed!
TRAVIS: Or they're like, "woo!"

3852
02:54:16.456 --> 02:54:17.289
Damn.

3853
02:54:19.144 --> 02:54:20.376
Come on, Gina.

3854
02:54:20.376 --> 02:54:22.209
SAM: (exaggerated German accent) Widogast's Web of--

3855
02:54:23.058 --> 02:54:24.643
LIAM: 32.

3856
02:54:24.643 --> 02:54:27.155
MATT: 32, all right, this fellow

3857
02:54:27.155 --> 02:54:29.129
fails! (whooshing flame)

3858
02:54:29.129 --> 02:54:32.015
These streaks of fire,

3859
02:54:32.015 --> 02:54:33.975
imagine an extremely volatile fuse

3860
02:54:33.975 --> 02:54:36.107
burning across the ground

3861
02:54:36.107 --> 02:54:37.848
snaking like they have a mind of their own,

3862
02:54:37.848 --> 02:54:40.446
homing in on the target and then once they arrive,

3863
02:54:40.446 --> 02:54:42.993
a column of flame (violently whooshes)

3864
02:54:42.993 --> 02:54:45.793
bursts out of the ground like a contained pillar

3865
02:54:45.793 --> 02:54:47.662
of pure fire and death.

3866
02:54:47.662 --> 02:54:50.407
You watch as it explodes under each of these creatures,

3867
02:54:50.407 --> 02:54:52.855
burning, their shrieks ringing out.

3868
02:54:52.855 --> 02:54:54.707
That one's destroyed, the two next to you, you said?

3869
02:54:54.707 --> 02:54:57.041
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: Failure.

3870
02:54:58.308 --> 02:54:59.649
And

3871
02:54:59.649 --> 02:55:01.552
failure.

3872
02:55:01.552 --> 02:55:02.635
MARISHA: Yes!

3873
02:55:04.663 --> 02:55:06.580
MATT: The one next to Fjord

3874
02:55:07.622 --> 02:55:10.133
succeeds with an 18, I believe?

3875
02:55:10.133 --> 02:55:11.416
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

3876
02:55:11.416 --> 02:55:12.826
MATT: And what was the damage total on that one?

3877
02:55:12.826 --> 02:55:13.908
LIAM: 32 total.

3878
02:55:13.908 --> 02:55:18.101
MATT: Yeah, so 16. He's looking real rough.

3879
02:55:18.101 --> 02:55:20.478
TALIESIN: He also took damage from you previously

3880
02:55:20.478 --> 02:55:22.459
from attacking you as well.
TRAVIS: One point.

3881
02:55:22.459 --> 02:55:25.893
MATT: Yeah, he's looking really rough.
TALIESIN: Well done.

3882
02:55:25.893 --> 02:55:28.010
MATT: The one off that way you said?

3883
02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:30.064
No, it was one, two, three, four, and then the big guy.

3884
02:55:30.064 --> 02:55:33.051
LIAM: Big frog.
MATT: He...

3885
02:55:33.051 --> 02:55:36.935
20, takes half damage, correct? Which would be 16.

3886
02:55:36.935 --> 02:55:38.666
LIAM: Quartered for him.
MATT: Yeah.

3887
02:55:38.666 --> 02:55:42.024
So eight points of fire damage (explosion)

3888
02:55:42.024 --> 02:55:44.068
it bursts and one of the two eyestalks looks down real fast

3889
02:55:44.068 --> 02:55:45.984
at where it's now burned and charred on one end

3890
02:55:45.984 --> 02:55:48.096
(burbles) look over in your direction.

3891
02:55:48.096 --> 02:55:50.116
LIAM: And for his movement, he starts

3892
02:55:50.116 --> 02:55:52.188
running this way, going like--

3893
02:55:52.188 --> 02:55:53.021
MATT: Which way?

3894
02:55:53.021 --> 02:55:55.467
LIAM: This-- in a curve around,

3895
02:55:55.467 --> 02:55:57.558
but not close to big frog.

3896
02:55:57.558 --> 02:55:59.628
Midway between these two.

3897
02:55:59.628 --> 02:56:00.706
MATT: 25, 30, right there?

3898
02:56:00.706 --> 02:56:02.039
LIAM: Yeah sure, that's good.
MATT: You got it.

3899
02:56:02.039 --> 02:56:06.005
Okay, it's now the mites turn.

3900
02:56:06.005 --> 02:56:08.362
Swarming on Jester, swarming on the creature,

3901
02:56:08.362 --> 02:56:11.984
and swarming on you now, Caleb.

3902
02:56:11.984 --> 02:56:16.294
That is 10 points of lightning damage to each of you.

3903
02:56:16.294 --> 02:56:18.093
LIAM: Do we do con saves for this?

3904
02:56:18.093 --> 02:56:19.568
MATT: No, this just happens

3905
02:56:19.568 --> 02:56:20.844
from casting the spell.

3906
02:56:20.844 --> 02:56:22.394
10 points of lightning damage to both of you.

3907
02:56:22.394 --> 02:56:24.106
LAURA: So you get the same amount of damage

3908
02:56:24.106 --> 02:56:27.464
if you do a level one or a level five?

3909
02:56:27.464 --> 02:56:30.547
TRAVIS: It appears that way.
LAURA: Good to know.

3910
02:56:32.777 --> 02:56:34.431
MATT: You've learned possibly something here.

3911
02:56:34.431 --> 02:56:36.763
TRAVIS: Learning the fight.

3912
02:56:36.763 --> 02:56:40.714
MATT: There is the shocking impact
on the creature right there.

3913
02:56:40.714 --> 02:56:43.550
You watch it flash and it takes a little bit of damage,

3914
02:56:43.550 --> 02:56:45.033
but it seems to thrash around.

3915
02:56:45.033 --> 02:56:47.891
(croaks unhappily)

3916
02:56:47.891 --> 02:56:49.857
Even though it didn't take a lot of damage,

3917
02:56:49.857 --> 02:56:54.066
it looks like its body is spasming from the effect

3918
02:56:54.066 --> 02:56:58.697
of the lightning strike on its body from the mites.

3919
02:56:58.697 --> 02:57:00.914
TRAVIS: It's resistant to the lightning.

3920
02:57:01.914 --> 02:57:05.197
MARISHA: Resistant but not immune.
LAURA: But the mites...?

3921
02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:08.929
MATT: That brings us to Fjord's turn.

3922
02:57:08.929 --> 02:57:09.762
TRAVIS: Yes,

3923
02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:11.920
right,

3924
02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:15.226
well, cool beans.

3925
02:57:15.226 --> 02:57:19.309
I will take two more strikes with the Star Razor.

3926
02:57:20.143 --> 02:57:24.143
Against Frog McGee. That's 13, that sucks balls.

3927
02:57:25.073 --> 02:57:28.844
Wow, 16, 17, 18, oh actually the first one's a 14

3928
02:57:28.844 --> 02:57:30.641
because it's plus two when its glowing,

3929
02:57:30.641 --> 02:57:33.296
14 still misses, right?

3930
02:57:33.296 --> 02:57:37.310
MATT: Actually, they both hit, because of reasons.

3931
02:57:37.310 --> 02:57:38.455
SAM: Okay.

3932
02:57:38.455 --> 02:57:40.717
TRAVIS: All right, I am a fan of reasons.

3933
02:57:40.717 --> 02:57:43.041
MATT: It seems sluggish in its attempts to resist your

3934
02:57:43.041 --> 02:57:46.391
attacks from the previous mite assault that it took.

3935
02:57:46.391 --> 02:57:49.011
SAM and LAURA: The mites can slow it down.

3936
02:57:49.011 --> 02:57:51.199
TRAVIS: Reasons all day, erryday.

3937
02:57:52.157 --> 02:57:55.427
SAM: Lightning doesn't cause damage, but it does slow it?

3938
02:57:55.427 --> 02:57:58.592
LAURA: Or do the mites do extra damage?

3939
02:57:58.592 --> 02:58:00.182
SAM: But the mites didn't do that to you guys.

3940
02:58:00.182 --> 02:58:02.080
LAURA and MARISHA: No.

3941
02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:04.362
TRAVIS: 30, no,

3942
02:58:04.362 --> 02:58:05.445
16 plus 17.

3943
02:58:07.228 --> 02:58:08.716
MATT: That's 35.
TRAVIS: Yes.

3944
02:58:08.716 --> 02:58:10.720
MATT: 33, sorry.

3945
02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:13.018
TRAVIS: Total, slashing.

3946
02:58:13.018 --> 02:58:16.805
MATT: It is looking hurt, as you now, seeing it shock

3947
02:58:16.805 --> 02:58:19.315
and trying to pull back into the water.

3948
02:58:19.315 --> 02:58:22.191
It looks like it's trying to pull back to retract.

3949
02:58:22.191 --> 02:58:24.849
You slice in its belly once, you see a bunch of this

3950
02:58:24.849 --> 02:58:27.446
dark purple ichor spill out and darken part of the water

3951
02:58:27.446 --> 02:58:29.556
to its side, a second slash goes upward

3952
02:58:29.556 --> 02:58:31.153
and you actually cut into part of its lip.

3953
02:58:31.153 --> 02:58:32.536
It's splitting down the middle and you can see

3954
02:58:32.536 --> 02:58:34.418
the gums all bloody and it's now leaking onto

3955
02:58:34.418 --> 02:58:37.043
the side of its belly (croaking roars).

3956
02:58:37.043 --> 02:58:40.508
TRAVIS: Is there a foot sticking up
out of the back of that maw?

3957
02:58:40.508 --> 02:58:42.242
MATT: Unfortunately, no, pretty deep in its stomach

3958
02:58:42.242 --> 02:58:44.023
and it's a big creature.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3959
02:58:44.023 --> 02:58:46.102
MATT: Just for comparison here, you're only seeing

3960
02:58:46.102 --> 02:58:48.078
the upper half of its belly right now,

3961
02:58:48.078 --> 02:58:50.467
and even that's about twelve feet out of the water.

3962
02:58:50.467 --> 02:58:52.384
So it's a big creature.

3963
02:58:54.833 --> 02:58:57.328
There we go, that finishes Fjord's turn,

3964
02:58:57.328 --> 02:58:58.406
unless you want to move or anything else.

3965
02:58:58.406 --> 02:59:00.069
TRAVIS: No, I'm good, thank you.
MATT: Jester, you're up.

3966
02:59:00.069 --> 02:59:03.097
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to hit it with the Spiritual Weapon.

3967
02:59:03.097 --> 02:59:04.970
MATT: Go for it.
LAURA: At the same time,

3968
02:59:04.970 --> 02:59:09.196
I'm going to run underneath and between Fjord's legs,

3969
02:59:09.196 --> 02:59:11.124
I'm going to reach up with my hand and cast

3970
02:59:11.124 --> 02:59:13.654
Inflict Wounds on it at the same time.

3971
02:59:13.654 --> 02:59:15.492
TRAVIS: Ooh, get that shit!
SAM: Right on the spot

3972
02:59:15.492 --> 02:59:17.067
that he was slashing.
MATT: All right,

3973
02:59:17.067 --> 02:59:18.650
roll for an attack.

3974
02:59:21.036 --> 02:59:22.742
LAURA: Is this my Spiritual--?
SAM: That's cocked!

3975
02:59:22.742 --> 02:59:24.116
MATT: Spiritual Weapon is what this is.

3976
02:59:24.116 --> 02:59:25.152
LAURA: That's cocked? it didn't look like--

3977
02:59:25.152 --> 02:59:26.668
TALIESIN: It was lifted.

3978
02:59:26.668 --> 02:59:29.979
LAURA: Okay, well, that's better, that's a 21.

3979
02:59:29.979 --> 02:59:30.812
MATT: 21 with the Spiritual Weapon?

3980
02:59:30.812 --> 02:59:31.645
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: That definitely hits.

3981
02:59:31.645 --> 02:59:33.252
Roll damage.

3982
02:59:34.302 --> 02:59:36.758
LAURA: Six.
MATT: Six points of damage.

3983
02:59:36.758 --> 02:59:38.528
And then you rush forward.

3984
02:59:38.528 --> 02:59:40.042
You end up wading a bit into the water

3985
02:59:40.042 --> 02:59:42.287
when you get past Fjord

3986
02:59:42.287 --> 02:59:45.117
to push your way towards the creature

3987
02:59:45.117 --> 02:59:47.226
(splashing), and reach outward.

3988
02:59:47.226 --> 02:59:49.006
Roll for your attack with your Inflict Wounds.

3989
02:59:49.006 --> 02:59:50.190
Casting it at first level?

3990
02:59:50.190 --> 02:59:53.136
LAURA: No, at second level.
MATT: Second level, got it.

3991
02:59:53.136 --> 02:59:55.769
LAURA: Ooh, that definitely hits, that's 27.

3992
02:59:55.769 --> 02:59:58.247
MATT: 27, yes, that does hit.

3993
02:59:58.247 --> 03:00:01.180
LAURA: So that's 4d6.

3994
03:00:01.180 --> 03:00:02.149
MATT: 4d10.

3995
03:00:02.149 --> 03:00:04.106
LAURA: 4d10!

3996
03:00:04.106 --> 03:00:05.956
TRAVIS: 4d10?!

3997
03:00:05.956 --> 03:00:06.964
MATT: Inflict Wounds!

3998
03:00:06.964 --> 03:00:08.329
You got to get right up in there to do it;

3999
03:00:08.329 --> 03:00:09.926
it's a touch spell, but man, it hurts.

4000
03:00:09.926 --> 03:00:11.107
LAURA: That's why I had my duplicate up,

4001
03:00:11.107 --> 03:00:14.436
I was going to do it with her, but.

4002
03:00:14.436 --> 03:00:16.519
LAURA: 16, 20,

4003
03:00:17.469 --> 03:00:18.537
20 points.

4004
03:00:18.537 --> 03:00:20.497
MATT: 20 points of damage.

4005
03:00:20.497 --> 03:00:24.150
LAURA: Of necromantic.
MATT: Necrotic damage, you got it.

4006
03:00:24.150 --> 03:00:24.983
How do you want to do this?

4007
03:00:24.983 --> 03:00:27.991
(cheering)

4008
03:00:31.449 --> 03:00:34.386
LAURA: I want to get my hand up into the cut

4009
03:00:34.386 --> 03:00:36.490
and grab onto it as I cast it

4010
03:00:36.490 --> 03:00:38.648
and then yank down at the same time.
SAM: Frog legs!

4011
03:00:38.648 --> 03:00:39.869
MATT: As your fingers find their

4012
03:00:39.869 --> 03:00:43.679
way into the strangely, grossly warm flesh

4013
03:00:43.679 --> 03:00:44.756
exposed from the wound--

4014
03:00:44.756 --> 03:00:46.945
LAURA: And my Traveler symbol is dangling from my wrist

4015
03:00:46.945 --> 03:00:48.759
and is like yeah.
MATT: As you reach in,

4016
03:00:48.759 --> 03:00:50.646
the Traveler symbol that's danging actually

4017
03:00:50.646 --> 03:00:52.951
magnetically goes (slicing) and plunges itself

4018
03:00:52.951 --> 03:00:56.145
in there beneath your grip and then burns

4019
03:00:56.145 --> 03:00:58.904
dark black as necrotic energy pulses through its body.

4020
03:00:58.904 --> 03:01:00.971
You see dozens of veins suddenly go black

4021
03:01:00.971 --> 03:01:02.493
around its torso and as it pulls back

4022
03:01:02.493 --> 03:01:05.452
(croaky screams) screaming you see the black veins

4023
03:01:05.452 --> 03:01:07.526
curling further and further up along its body

4024
03:01:07.526 --> 03:01:09.796
before its eyes go milky white,

4025
03:01:09.796 --> 03:01:13.636
its skin goes pale, and it (thumps) falls over

4026
03:01:13.636 --> 03:01:16.672
into the pool, its tentacles off to the side,

4027
03:01:16.672 --> 03:01:19.232
itself half dangling and half sunken into the water.

4028
03:01:19.232 --> 03:01:22.056
LAURA: Quick, quick, get them out, get them out!

4029
03:01:22.056 --> 03:01:24.153
SAM: Is it sinking or is it stable?

4030
03:01:24.153 --> 03:01:26.422
MATT: Well, does that finish your turn?

4031
03:01:26.422 --> 03:01:29.617
LAURA: I guess, I mean.
TRAVIS: There's still one frog fuck.

4032
03:01:29.617 --> 03:01:30.734
Two frog fucks.

4033
03:01:30.734 --> 03:01:32.690
LAURA: I already used my bonus action and my attack.

4034
03:01:32.690 --> 03:01:34.444
MATT: You have a little bit of movement left.

4035
03:01:34.444 --> 03:01:36.468
Actually, with going into the water for that,

4036
03:01:36.468 --> 03:01:39.463
I'd say you have five feet.
LAURA: I'm pretty much done.

4037
03:01:39.463 --> 03:01:41.603
MATT: You got it, finishing your turn, the creature--

4038
03:01:41.603 --> 03:01:43.168
you both, even though it's dead,

4039
03:01:43.168 --> 03:01:44.437
you still take acid damage in its belly.

4040
03:01:44.437 --> 03:01:46.794
TALIESIN: That's fine.

4041
03:01:46.794 --> 03:01:49.227
MATT: That is nine points of acid damage to both of you.

4042
03:01:49.227 --> 03:01:50.676
TALIESIN: Ew.
SAM: Ouch.

4043
03:01:50.676 --> 03:01:53.691
MATT: And the body is slowly (wet sliding)

4044
03:01:53.691 --> 03:01:56.038
slinking in towards

4045
03:01:56.038 --> 03:01:58.932
the center of the pond.
TALIESIN: And I lose my concentration.

4046
03:01:58.932 --> 03:02:01.123
Oh no, wait wait, not that it matters anymore.

4047
03:02:01.123 --> 03:02:02.690
Oh, he's dead, my concentration on the spell

4048
03:02:02.690 --> 03:02:05.236
is broken anyway.
MATT: Correct.

4049
03:02:05.236 --> 03:02:06.502
TALIESIN: I know he's dead then.

4050
03:02:06.502 --> 03:02:08.131
MATT: You do.

4051
03:02:08.131 --> 03:02:10.166
SAM: I'm going to start climbing out, if it's our turn.

4052
03:02:10.166 --> 03:02:14.133
MATT: Yes, you guys can both, on your turn,
climb out of its body.

4053
03:02:14.133 --> 03:02:15.141
You're no longer restrained

4054
03:02:15.141 --> 03:02:16.668
and you escape it using 10 feet of movement,

4055
03:02:16.668 --> 03:02:18.535
exiting prone, so both of you,

4056
03:02:18.535 --> 03:02:21.285
as it's slipping in towards the water,

4057
03:02:21.285 --> 03:02:24.638
you both leap out of its mouth (thudding),

4058
03:02:24.638 --> 03:02:26.020
losing 10 feet of movement and stepping

4059
03:02:26.020 --> 03:02:28.780
onto the ground before it sinks below the waves.

4060
03:02:28.780 --> 03:02:30.698
TALIESIN: That was unpleasant.
TRAVIS: Check its pockets!

4061
03:02:30.698 --> 03:02:32.748
(laughter)

4062
03:02:33.922 --> 03:02:36.726
MATT: You guys both, you're prone and you've lost

4063
03:02:36.726 --> 03:02:39.073
10 feet of movement. You still have your actions

4064
03:02:39.073 --> 03:02:41.025
and everything you want to this turn, if anything.

4065
03:02:41.025 --> 03:02:43.999
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up, brush myself off,

4066
03:02:43.999 --> 03:02:47.199
and look at all of these things.

4067
03:02:47.199 --> 03:02:48.861
MATT: There's three of them currently.

4068
03:02:48.861 --> 03:02:51.416
TALIESIN: There are frog people attacking.

4069
03:02:51.416 --> 03:02:53.439
That's what I was going to say, before.

4070
03:02:53.439 --> 03:02:54.858
MATT: Their eyes are bugging on the sides of their head

4071
03:02:54.858 --> 03:02:57.939
and they're holding spears and shields.

4072
03:02:57.939 --> 03:03:01.309
TALIESIN: I'm putting up my shield and just egging them on.

4073
03:03:01.309 --> 03:03:03.668
LAURA: Do they still look as ready to fight

4074
03:03:03.668 --> 03:03:05.729
now that their giant frog is--

4075
03:03:05.729 --> 03:03:07.212
MATT: We'll find out.

4076
03:03:07.212 --> 03:03:10.444
SAM: I guess I'll fire at somebody, whoever's closest.

4077
03:03:10.444 --> 03:03:13.032
MATT: Closest to you right here,
you're on the ground, prone.

4078
03:03:13.032 --> 03:03:15.258
SAM: I'll stand up.

4079
03:03:15.258 --> 03:03:18.508
That's another 15 feet of movement or something like that?

4080
03:03:18.508 --> 03:03:19.791
MATT: 15 feet.

4081
03:03:19.791 --> 03:03:21.696
SAM: Fire at one of them.

4082
03:03:21.696 --> 03:03:22.529
MATT: Which one? There's three of them.

4083
03:03:22.529 --> 03:03:24.029
There's one next to Fjord and Jester,

4084
03:03:24.029 --> 03:03:25.218
one back here closer to Caleb.

4085
03:03:25.218 --> 03:03:27.310
SAM: The one next to Fjord and Jester, please.

4086
03:03:27.310 --> 03:03:28.393
MATT: You got it.

4087
03:03:29.671 --> 03:03:32.391
SAM: 19 to hit?
MATT: That definitely hits.

4088
03:03:34.099 --> 03:03:37.722
SAM: A million. Million points of--
MATT: It had one hit point left.

4089
03:03:37.722 --> 03:03:40.835
You get up, and we're talking Blackthorne-style

4090
03:03:40.835 --> 03:03:43.394
shooting over the shoulder, barely even looking.

4091
03:03:43.394 --> 03:03:45.911
Firing and you watch as it looks its bug eyes

4092
03:03:45.911 --> 03:03:47.957
in two different directions, it goes to turn, and then

4093
03:03:47.957 --> 03:03:50.843
slumps into the water, rolls,

4094
03:03:50.843 --> 03:03:53.361
and then itself sinks back under the waves.

4095
03:03:53.361 --> 03:03:55.018
It's floating and sinking next to you, Jester.

4096
03:03:55.018 --> 03:03:57.817
You watch it (wet sinking).

4097
03:03:57.817 --> 03:04:00.137
SAM: And then I'll use my bonus action to dash

4098
03:04:00.137 --> 03:04:03.749
across the water back to that waterfall.

4099
03:04:03.749 --> 03:04:06.101
TRAVIS: (roars)
SAM: No!

4100
03:04:06.101 --> 03:04:08.192
That was the baby!

4101
03:04:08.192 --> 03:04:10.025
(laughter)

4102
03:04:10.025 --> 03:04:12.274
MATT: Heavy waterfall now (splashing)

4103
03:04:12.274 --> 03:04:14.856
It's a big impact on you, right now, you--

4104
03:04:14.856 --> 03:04:16.591
SAM: I'll just get up to the edge of the mist.

4105
03:04:16.591 --> 03:04:18.250
MATT: It's splashing you. You're getting wet.

4106
03:04:18.250 --> 03:04:20.625
All right, that finishes your guys' turns.

4107
03:04:20.625 --> 03:04:23.893
These creatures turn and fucking run.

4108
03:04:23.893 --> 03:04:25.719
TALIESIN: That's right.
MATT: Double dash,

4109
03:04:25.719 --> 03:04:30.417
off the board, running out of sight.

4110
03:04:30.417 --> 03:04:32.334
LAURA: What about the mites?

4111
03:04:33.422 --> 03:04:37.378
MATT: Well, you're currently no longer in battle.

4112
03:04:37.378 --> 03:04:39.495
SAM: Do they still like magic?

4113
03:04:39.495 --> 03:04:42.467
MATT: (whooshes) They do.

4114
03:04:42.467 --> 03:04:45.884
And they return to both Caleb and Jester.

4115
03:04:46.808 --> 03:04:49.227
LAURA: Well, we did the last--

4116
03:04:49.227 --> 03:04:50.574
MATT: 12 points of lightning damage to each of you.

4117
03:04:50.574 --> 03:04:51.915
SAM and TRAVIS: Oof!

4118
03:04:54.421 --> 03:04:56.421
LAURA: Gets worse every time!

4119
03:04:57.371 --> 03:04:58.614
SAM: No more magic!

4120
03:04:58.614 --> 03:05:03.076
TALIESIN: Let's take a second--
TRAVIS: More magic?

4121
03:05:03.076 --> 03:05:05.193
TALIESIN: Well, with that,

4122
03:05:06.808 --> 03:05:07.641
I think I'm going to

4123
03:05:07.641 --> 03:05:09.857
look behind this waterfall.
MARISHA: Yes!

4124
03:05:09.857 --> 03:05:14.485
TALIESIN: And I'm going to walk around,
climb up, and peer behind

4125
03:05:14.485 --> 03:05:16.535
the first, up this little--

4126
03:05:16.535 --> 03:05:18.717
MATT: Okay, you look behind and now

4127
03:05:18.717 --> 03:05:20.505
having viewed this little gap,

4128
03:05:20.505 --> 03:05:21.439
you're looking from underneath it,

4129
03:05:21.439 --> 03:05:24.207
the two of you triangulate there is a bit of space

4130
03:05:24.207 --> 03:05:26.953
behind the immediate waterfall. There is no path to it,

4131
03:05:26.953 --> 03:05:28.243
you'd have to move through the water,

4132
03:05:28.243 --> 03:05:29.870
but there is apparently a gap.

4133
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:33.544
SAM: I will cast Shape Water.

4134
03:05:33.544 --> 03:05:37.069
(laughter)

4135
03:05:38.115 --> 03:05:41.322
SAM: And I will angle the waterfall around

4136
03:05:41.322 --> 03:05:43.664
making a nice little pathway for us to get in.

4137
03:05:43.664 --> 03:05:45.180
MATT: Okay, you carve it to the side,

4138
03:05:45.180 --> 03:05:46.678
you watch the waterfall spread open,

4139
03:05:46.678 --> 03:05:49.694
leaving a path to a cavern behind it.

4140
03:05:49.694 --> 03:05:52.627
LAURA: Wow!
MATT: You also take

4141
03:05:52.627 --> 03:05:54.758
six points of lightning damage as the motes--

4142
03:05:54.758 --> 03:05:57.562
or the mites shift and gravitate toward you,

4143
03:05:57.562 --> 03:05:58.865
shocking your body

4144
03:05:58.865 --> 03:06:00.835
and then drifting away, sustained by

4145
03:06:00.835 --> 03:06:04.062
whatever sort of nutrients they drew from the attack.

4146
03:06:04.062 --> 03:06:05.853
LAURA: Should we all go there?

4147
03:06:05.853 --> 03:06:08.353
MATT: Is it a concentration spell?

4148
03:06:09.211 --> 03:06:13.651
SAM: It is...n't?

4149
03:06:13.651 --> 03:06:16.240
It says instantaneous. It doesn't say--

4150
03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:19.509
LAURA: There's nothing about concentration.
MATT: How long does it last?

4151
03:06:19.509 --> 03:06:21.111
SAM: It's also a cantrip.

4152
03:06:21.111 --> 03:06:22.159
MATT: Oh, it's a cantrip?

4153
03:06:22.159 --> 03:06:23.266
Oh, then you're fine.

4154
03:06:23.266 --> 03:06:26.308
SAM: This is Shape Water, sorry, not Control Water,

4155
03:06:26.308 --> 03:06:29.983
Shape Water.
MATT: Correct, got you.

4156
03:06:32.209 --> 03:06:34.290
Shape Water, where is that?

4157
03:06:34.290 --> 03:06:36.670
SAM: I can make a five foot cube of--

4158
03:06:36.670 --> 03:06:38.837
MATT: Ah, there it is.

4159
03:06:39.974 --> 03:06:41.557
TALIESIN: All right.

4160
03:06:43.001 --> 03:06:45.827
MATT: Yeah, there's no concentration worry about it.

4161
03:06:45.827 --> 03:06:50.319
For the next hour, the opening is available.

4162
03:06:50.319 --> 03:06:52.027
LAURA: Let's go!
SAM: Our plan worked,

4163
03:06:52.027 --> 03:06:55.471
let's go in.
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, hang on.

4164
03:06:55.471 --> 03:06:58.615
Can I check the door, see any markings,

4165
03:06:58.615 --> 03:07:01.706
once again any scents coming from it like before?

4166
03:07:01.706 --> 03:07:02.997
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4167
03:07:02.997 --> 03:07:04.040
TALIESIN: Without advantage.

4168
03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:07.979
TRAVIS: Remember, there are five entrances or exits

4169
03:07:07.979 --> 03:07:11.095
out of this, so there could be--

4170
03:07:11.095 --> 03:07:13.666
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,

4171
03:07:13.666 --> 03:07:14.902
21.

4172
03:07:15.860 --> 03:07:20.000
MATT: The door itself is a soft, dark burgundy red color.

4173
03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.122
The wood itself is moist from the moisture

4174
03:07:22.122 --> 03:07:24.452
that's pushed in here via the waterfall.

4175
03:07:24.452 --> 03:07:26.633
There's a brass doorknob on it.

4176
03:07:26.633 --> 03:07:28.400
It seems out of place against this rock wall

4177
03:07:28.400 --> 03:07:30.760
and the actual cavern behind this waterfall

4178
03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:32.681
only goes back about six or seven feet deep

4179
03:07:32.681 --> 03:07:35.456
before you find this doorway.

4180
03:07:35.456 --> 03:07:38.284
The door itself smells of fresh wood

4181
03:07:38.284 --> 03:07:39.674
and looking across the front of it,

4182
03:07:39.674 --> 03:07:42.182
there's slight carvings,

4183
03:07:42.182 --> 03:07:46.165
looks like the shape of hexagons.

4184
03:07:46.165 --> 03:07:49.025
Like six-sided hexagons.
LIAM: It's the study.

4185
03:07:49.025 --> 03:07:51.404
SAM: Or the Tower Machine.

4186
03:07:51.404 --> 03:07:55.314
MARISHA: Would I, from our previous time in the study,

4187
03:07:55.314 --> 03:07:59.473
recognize this wood? Does it look familiar to the doors

4188
03:07:59.473 --> 03:08:00.530
that we saw in the study?

4189
03:08:00.530 --> 03:08:02.703
MATT: It definitely seems in the color scheme

4190
03:08:02.703 --> 03:08:06.146
that Halas likes to dress in. Red with gold trim,

4191
03:08:06.146 --> 03:08:08.200
generally was what you guys found on the outfits

4192
03:08:08.200 --> 03:08:11.444
that dropped out of the sphere when you first

4193
03:08:11.444 --> 03:08:13.091
encountered it, as well as the portrait

4194
03:08:13.091 --> 03:08:15.174
you saw within the study.

4195
03:08:16.162 --> 03:08:18.690
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl higher
and look into the next one.

4196
03:08:18.690 --> 03:08:20.203
TRAVIS: While they're studying, I'll tell

4197
03:08:20.203 --> 03:08:23.226
Caleb and Beau and just generally and say

4198
03:08:23.226 --> 03:08:25.226
I want to check the pool and I'm going to dive

4199
03:08:25.226 --> 03:08:27.412
into the pool where the creature fell into

4200
03:08:27.412 --> 03:08:29.729
and scan the floor, make sure that there's--

4201
03:08:29.729 --> 03:08:31.176
MATT: Make a perception check.
LAURA: Just putting out there,

4202
03:08:31.176 --> 03:08:32.806
that if this does go to the study--

4203
03:08:32.806 --> 03:08:35.236
SAM: That's the wrong way.
LAURA: It's the wrong way, but

4204
03:08:35.236 --> 03:08:37.580
from the study, I thought it said "Flesh Mound"

4205
03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:41.188
because obviously, but it actually says "Flesh Mend."

4206
03:08:41.188 --> 03:08:44.683
So it might be a place that heals.

4207
03:08:44.683 --> 03:08:45.850
SAM: Interesting.

4208
03:08:47.179 --> 03:08:49.134
LAURA: Just letting you guys know.
TRAVIS: 17.

4209
03:08:49.134 --> 03:08:52.806
MATT: You dive down. There's this thick algae blanket

4210
03:08:52.806 --> 03:08:57.018
and you pull through and the further down you get,

4211
03:08:57.018 --> 03:09:00.724
you can see the funneling hole.

4212
03:09:00.724 --> 03:09:03.713
You don't see the body of the creature you had just slain,

4213
03:09:03.713 --> 03:09:05.822
nor that other smaller frog creature

4214
03:09:05.822 --> 03:09:09.031
that sunk down below it, just a dark path

4215
03:09:09.031 --> 03:09:10.271
that leads deeper and deeper below.

4216
03:09:10.271 --> 03:09:11.732
LAURA: Another doorway!

4217
03:09:11.732 --> 03:09:13.090
MATT: The water is slightly pulling you

4218
03:09:13.090 --> 03:09:14.130
in that direction as well.

4219
03:09:14.130 --> 03:09:16.312
TRAVIS: I start swimming back up.
MATT: Make a strength saving throw for me.

4220
03:09:16.312 --> 03:09:19.971
LAURA: Oh god, Fjord, again?

4221
03:09:19.971 --> 03:09:21.429
SAM: Oh no.

4222
03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:24.710
MATT: What'd you get?
LAURA: A one, did you roll a one?

4223
03:09:25.574 --> 03:09:27.411
Did we see him go into the water this time?

4224
03:09:27.411 --> 03:09:28.954
MATT: You watched him.

4225
03:09:28.954 --> 03:09:32.053
You did, you watched him dive into the water.

4226
03:09:32.053 --> 03:09:34.657
And you look down and you can see the darkness below

4227
03:09:34.657 --> 03:09:36.574
and you're like, "okay." (whooshes)

4228
03:09:36.574 --> 03:09:37.587
TALIESIN: Do you have bonuses in water by the way?

4229
03:09:37.587 --> 03:09:38.495
MATT: "Shit, shit!"

4230
03:09:38.495 --> 03:09:41.815
TRAVIS: Can I cast quickly Control Water and reverse

4231
03:09:41.815 --> 03:09:44.898
the flow of water, shooting me up out of the pool?

4232
03:09:44.898 --> 03:09:46.657
If I'm getting close enough to that--

4233
03:09:46.657 --> 03:09:48.707
MATT: I'll allow it, yeah. That is an ability of yours.

4234
03:09:48.707 --> 03:09:49.859
And you do maintain it through the connection

4235
03:09:49.859 --> 03:09:50.965
to the Wildmother, you didn't lose it

4236
03:09:50.965 --> 03:09:53.755
because of the pact you made with her.

4237
03:09:53.755 --> 03:09:56.164
At the moment you begin to pull yourself

4238
03:09:56.164 --> 03:09:58.949
drawn down towards the base of the water,

4239
03:09:58.949 --> 03:10:00.929
you immediately concentrate, cast the spell,

4240
03:10:00.929 --> 03:10:02.246
and reverse the flow and suddenly you guys

4241
03:10:02.246 --> 03:10:06.055
watch as Fjord disappears beneath the surface.

4242
03:10:06.055 --> 03:10:07.453
(explosive splash)

4243
03:10:07.453 --> 03:10:08.305
TRAVIS: (screams)
MATT: It jettisons him

4244
03:10:08.305 --> 03:10:10.572
about 15 feet in the air before he comes landing

4245
03:10:10.572 --> 03:10:13.532
(splash) into the water once more.

4246
03:10:13.532 --> 03:10:15.280
It's bubbling up, almost like a

4247
03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:19.070
soft geyser. It got an immediate push

4248
03:10:19.070 --> 03:10:20.953
and as is now burbling from the center.

4249
03:10:20.953 --> 03:10:22.328
LAURA: Did you find something?

4250
03:10:22.328 --> 03:10:25.179
TRAVIS: Are the fucking fireflies coming?

4251
03:10:25.179 --> 03:10:27.154
MATT: Right now, they would be.

4252
03:10:27.154 --> 03:10:28.228
TRAVIS: I'll duck my head back under

4253
03:10:28.228 --> 03:10:30.711
the water and just hold under.

4254
03:10:30.711 --> 03:10:33.095
MATT: You guys watch all the mites
swarm to the top of the water

4255
03:10:33.095 --> 03:10:35.704
and stay about an inch off the surface

4256
03:10:35.704 --> 03:10:38.465
and stay there for a second before--

4257
03:10:38.465 --> 03:10:40.620
ALL: Oh!

4258
03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:43.732
LAURA: I guess we all could have done that.

4259
03:10:43.732 --> 03:10:45.845
TALIESIN: Fjord, you can come out now.

4260
03:10:45.845 --> 03:10:47.158
Fjord, you can-- he's not listening.

4261
03:10:47.158 --> 03:10:48.579
LAURA: I hit the water.

4262
03:10:48.579 --> 03:10:50.242
TRAVIS: (panting)

4263
03:10:50.242 --> 03:10:52.114
TALIESIN: You're good.
LAURA: What'd you find?

4264
03:10:52.114 --> 03:10:55.502
TRAVIS: There's a (coughs) another tunnel,

4265
03:10:55.502 --> 03:10:58.707
a dark tunnel that just goes, the body is not down there.

4266
03:10:58.707 --> 03:11:01.192
MARISHA: I bet it's the Nest.

4267
03:11:01.192 --> 03:11:05.257
Which means, okay, based on the direction

4268
03:11:05.257 --> 03:11:07.593
that we came in from the Diamond Entrance

4269
03:11:07.593 --> 03:11:10.699
and the direction that we moved to the water,

4270
03:11:10.699 --> 03:11:14.097
would I have gathered that it seems that these

4271
03:11:14.097 --> 03:11:18.167
doorways are a little bit accurate to where he's put them?

4272
03:11:18.167 --> 03:11:19.229
On the map?

4273
03:11:20.273 --> 03:11:21.716
MATT: You're not entirely certain.

4274
03:11:21.716 --> 03:11:25.450
It could be, but in some cases, they also seem to be

4275
03:11:25.450 --> 03:11:27.518
arranged for space in the map, as well.

4276
03:11:27.518 --> 03:11:28.571
So you're not certain.

4277
03:11:28.571 --> 03:11:31.140
TALIESIN: I'm hopping up to the next
level to see what's there.

4278
03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:34.077
TRAVIS: I don't think it would hurt to maybe check

4279
03:11:34.077 --> 03:11:37.899
maybe some outcroppings and maybe some tree trunks

4280
03:11:37.899 --> 03:11:40.557
for some Jack Skellington door type shit.

4281
03:11:40.557 --> 03:11:44.965
MATT: It is pretty sheer on this end.
Make a perception check.

4282
03:11:44.965 --> 03:11:46.537
LAURA: Maybe all the entrances are around the waterfall.

4283
03:11:46.537 --> 03:11:47.834
TALIESIN: Ah, 19!

4284
03:11:47.834 --> 03:11:50.427
MATT: The cliff gets pretty sheer

4285
03:11:50.427 --> 03:11:53.473
and about 60-65 feet up you can see what looks to be

4286
03:11:53.473 --> 03:11:57.350
a slight outcropping of stone and a small cave up there.

4287
03:11:57.350 --> 03:12:00.983
TALIESIN: I think I found something.
TRAVIS: That's three.

4288
03:12:00.983 --> 03:12:03.913
TALIESIN: But I'm going to want a rope.

4289
03:12:03.913 --> 03:12:05.994
Maybe two ropes.

4290
03:12:05.994 --> 03:12:07.457
I'm real tired.

4291
03:12:07.457 --> 03:12:08.707
That was a lot.

4292
03:12:10.357 --> 03:12:12.631
TRAVIS: Can I make my way over to

4293
03:12:12.631 --> 03:12:15.457
this outcropping and investigate this area

4294
03:12:15.457 --> 03:12:17.048
and these trees and see if there's anything

4295
03:12:17.048 --> 03:12:19.383
that looks like a hidden door?

4296
03:12:19.383 --> 03:12:20.446
MATT: Sure. You're just doing that yourself?

4297
03:12:20.446 --> 03:12:22.328
TRAVIS: What?
SAM: Just don't.

4298
03:12:22.328 --> 03:12:25.175
LAURA: Get sucked into something else, Fjord?

4299
03:12:25.175 --> 03:12:26.116
Since you every time--

4300
03:12:26.116 --> 03:12:27.520
TRAVIS: Well, by all mean, come with me.

4301
03:12:27.520 --> 03:12:29.239
TALIESIN: Take a buddy. Wherever you're going, take a buddy.

4302
03:12:29.239 --> 03:12:30.632
MARISHA: I'll go with you.

4303
03:12:30.632 --> 03:12:32.134
MATT: Okay, so Fjord and Beau, you're doing a general

4304
03:12:32.134 --> 03:12:35.440
inspection of the nearby trees, floor, what?

4305
03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:38.413
TRAVIS: Yeah, looking for any passages

4306
03:12:38.413 --> 03:12:39.856
anything that might have been hidden

4307
03:12:39.856 --> 03:12:41.444
from plain view.
MATT: Okay.

4308
03:12:41.444 --> 03:12:43.244
Either both make investigation checks

4309
03:12:43.244 --> 03:12:45.451
or one can aid the other for advantage, your choice.

4310
03:12:45.451 --> 03:12:47.965
TRAVIS: Let's do it.
MARISHA: All right.

4311
03:12:50.803 --> 03:12:52.794
TRAVIS: 21.
MARISHA: 25.

4312
03:12:52.794 --> 03:12:55.332
MATT: Fjord, you spend a while--

4313
03:12:55.332 --> 03:12:56.823
MARISHA: 24, 24.

4314
03:12:56.823 --> 03:12:59.640
MATT: 24?
MARISHA: Sorry, yes. Math.

4315
03:12:59.640 --> 03:13:02.612
MATT: You spend a while looking around,

4316
03:13:03.731 --> 03:13:04.775
Beauregard helping you out,

4317
03:13:04.775 --> 03:13:06.709
you begin to fan out on this side.

4318
03:13:06.709 --> 03:13:08.500
You go about five or six trees away,

4319
03:13:08.500 --> 03:13:09.853
starting to get a little nervous of the distance

4320
03:13:09.853 --> 03:13:11.535
of the party. You can still hear the waterfall

4321
03:13:11.535 --> 03:13:12.803
and you can still hear your friends

4322
03:13:12.803 --> 03:13:14.928
or the motes still drifting around.

4323
03:13:14.928 --> 03:13:16.856
But other than, it's quiet.

4324
03:13:16.856 --> 03:13:19.395
Strangely no bird sounds, which is weird

4325
03:13:19.395 --> 03:13:20.404
to be in an enclosed space like this

4326
03:13:20.404 --> 03:13:21.637
that feels like jungle to not have

4327
03:13:21.637 --> 03:13:24.634
the sounds of nature prevalent around you.

4328
03:13:25.892 --> 03:13:29.331
And you both, looking about, both of your eyes

4329
03:13:29.331 --> 03:13:31.569
fall on one singular tree where it looks like

4330
03:13:31.569 --> 03:13:35.778
there's a heavy knot arch on the side,

4331
03:13:36.655 --> 03:13:39.691
like a knot hole of some kind.

4332
03:13:39.691 --> 03:13:41.225
And you get a bit closer and you can look

4333
03:13:41.225 --> 03:13:42.690
and it looks natural from the outside.

4334
03:13:42.690 --> 03:13:46.252
It's maybe about a foot wide and about four feet tall.

4335
03:13:46.252 --> 03:13:47.471
It would be difficult, but a person

4336
03:13:47.471 --> 03:13:49.052
could probably squeeze through.

4337
03:13:49.052 --> 03:13:51.592
It does appear to enter into the tree.

4338
03:13:51.592 --> 03:13:53.542
TRAVIS: Goodness gracious, what is this?

4339
03:13:53.542 --> 03:13:56.333
MARISHA: I'm going to once again go over and investigate it.

4340
03:13:56.333 --> 03:14:00.386
Any markings, anything that would clue me in?

4341
03:14:00.386 --> 03:14:01.295
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4342
03:14:01.295 --> 03:14:03.115
MARISHA: This is probably the Tower, right?

4343
03:14:03.115 --> 03:14:06.837
TRAVIS: I will get the whip out, just in case.

4344
03:14:06.837 --> 03:14:09.662
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to do that you're walking

4345
03:14:09.662 --> 03:14:11.538
up to the edge of a cliff thing.

4346
03:14:11.538 --> 03:14:12.371
TRAVIS: Don't you have any ball bearings

4347
03:14:12.371 --> 03:14:13.850
you could just toss in that bitch?

4348
03:14:13.850 --> 03:14:16.588
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's a door. I could.

4349
03:14:16.588 --> 03:14:20.203
Lemme just check, let me look at it, I'm looking at it.

4350
03:14:20.203 --> 03:14:22.195
Okay, 17.

4351
03:14:23.147 --> 03:14:25.036
MATT: Is this investigation or perception?

4352
03:14:25.036 --> 03:14:26.128
MARISHA: This is investigation.

4353
03:14:26.128 --> 03:14:28.133
MATT: Okay, looking around the outside of the knot hole

4354
03:14:28.133 --> 03:14:30.435
you don't see any signs or symbols or any carvings

4355
03:14:30.435 --> 03:14:34.270
that give you any sense of what's within.

4356
03:14:34.270 --> 03:14:35.460
From what little bit of light's coming in there,

4357
03:14:35.460 --> 03:14:38.106
you can see the small space enters a few inches

4358
03:14:38.106 --> 03:14:40.824
and the curves just out of sight into darkness

4359
03:14:40.824 --> 03:14:43.019
from this perspective. You'd have to step in a little bit

4360
03:14:43.019 --> 03:14:44.548
and look around to see where it goes

4361
03:14:44.548 --> 03:14:46.129
or where it continues further in.

4362
03:14:46.129 --> 03:14:47.356
MARISHA: Do I step in?

4363
03:14:47.356 --> 03:14:49.989
TRAVIS: No.
MARISHA: Okay.

4364
03:14:49.989 --> 03:14:51.539
TRAVIS: That's my job. I push her aside and--

4365
03:14:51.539 --> 03:14:55.986
MARISHA: (screams)
(laughter)

4366
03:14:55.986 --> 03:14:57.552
MARISHA: I don't know what happened!

4367
03:14:57.552 --> 03:14:58.852
TALIESIN: All of you are a heart attack.

4368
03:14:58.852 --> 03:15:01.272
LAURA: Well look, if we think that that what goes under

4369
03:15:01.272 --> 03:15:04.680
the water goes to the Nest, then this is either

4370
03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:06.222
the Crystal Mines or the Tower Machine

4371
03:15:06.222 --> 03:15:08.118
and both of these are going to lead us to the heart.

4372
03:15:08.118 --> 03:15:09.473
SAM: I'm going to start climbing up that cliff

4373
03:15:09.473 --> 03:15:12.081
to check out the cave.

4374
03:15:12.081 --> 03:15:13.608
TALIESIN: All right, I'm watching to make sure

4375
03:15:13.608 --> 03:15:14.557
you don't get sucked in.

4376
03:15:14.557 --> 03:15:16.953
MATT: Make an athletics check for me.

4377
03:15:16.953 --> 03:15:18.197
LAURA: I'm going to guide her.

4378
03:15:18.197 --> 03:15:19.280
MATT: Okay.

4379
03:15:20.240 --> 03:15:24.806
MARISHA: Let's each take a door, see who gets there first.

4380
03:15:24.806 --> 03:15:27.685
SAM: 15, thanks to Guidance.

4381
03:15:27.685 --> 03:15:30.895
MATT: Not bad. The first 20 feet or so,

4382
03:15:30.895 --> 03:15:32.091
you manage to make your way up.

4383
03:15:32.091 --> 03:15:34.667
There a few rock handholds, but it is difficult.

4384
03:15:34.667 --> 03:15:36.912
The higher up you get, the more sheer and sparse

4385
03:15:36.912 --> 03:15:38.441
the actual handholds are and you find yourself

4386
03:15:38.441 --> 03:15:41.204
about 40 feet below that ridge

4387
03:15:41.204 --> 03:15:44.542
and starving for the next venture.

4388
03:15:44.542 --> 03:15:46.049
You can attempt again.

4389
03:15:46.049 --> 03:15:50.303
SAM: Reach into my chalk bag, get my hands all--

4390
03:15:50.303 --> 03:15:55.303
going to keep going, oh yeah, yeah, more,

4391
03:15:55.814 --> 03:15:57.872
23.

4392
03:15:57.872 --> 03:16:00.632
MATT: The next 20 feet or so, while you're missing

4393
03:16:00.632 --> 03:16:03.565
the actual handholds you need in immediate proximity,

4394
03:16:03.565 --> 03:16:06.315
you do see one small gap (exhales).

4395
03:16:06.315 --> 03:16:09.445
You take a breath, leap, and catch on the edge of it,

4396
03:16:09.445 --> 03:16:12.322
dangle a bit and then pull yourself up slightly

4397
03:16:12.322 --> 03:16:14.600
holding onto it, another leap, (grunts)

4398
03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:16.926
you catch two handholds and get yourself

4399
03:16:16.926 --> 03:16:19.271
about 40 feet above, you have one more length of 20 feet.

4400
03:16:19.271 --> 03:16:21.063
LAURA: Nott, you're doing really good!

4401
03:16:21.063 --> 03:16:23.072
TALIESIN: Really good.
SAM: (panting)

4402
03:16:23.072 --> 03:16:24.363
LAURA: Just don't fall.

4403
03:16:24.363 --> 03:16:26.868
SAM: Can you Guide me from down there?

4404
03:16:26.868 --> 03:16:28.915
TALIESIN: Nope. We could probably revive you if you fall.

4405
03:16:28.915 --> 03:16:30.588
Well, if you don't fall in the water.

4406
03:16:30.588 --> 03:16:32.899
LAURA: Just remember, you can't use your spells to catch you

4407
03:16:32.899 --> 03:16:34.486
because then you'll be electrocuted

4408
03:16:34.486 --> 03:16:36.522
by a bunch of little fireflies.

4409
03:16:36.522 --> 03:16:38.076
SAM: I forgot!

4410
03:16:38.076 --> 03:16:39.756
MATT: At that point, you look around you

4411
03:16:39.756 --> 03:16:41.657
and there are like six motes just drifting

4412
03:16:41.657 --> 03:16:45.762
in the vicinity.
TRAVIS: We're cheering you on.

4413
03:16:45.762 --> 03:16:49.512
SAM: Get the last, the Hillary step, here we go.

4414
03:16:51.642 --> 03:16:53.022
14?

4415
03:16:53.022 --> 03:16:53.855
MATT: 14?

4416
03:16:54.914 --> 03:16:56.497
You get partway up,

4417
03:16:57.694 --> 03:16:58.999
and your foot slips

4418
03:16:58.999 --> 03:17:01.315
and you catch yourself, your grip's starting to go.

4419
03:17:01.315 --> 03:17:02.661
LAURA: You can do it!
MATT: Make one more check

4420
03:17:02.661 --> 03:17:03.754
with disadvantage to see if you can

4421
03:17:03.754 --> 03:17:06.947
maintain and scramble up.

4422
03:17:06.947 --> 03:17:08.113
SAM: Ooh!

4423
03:17:08.113 --> 03:17:10.157
TRAVIS: Say it.
SAM: 18 and a one!

4424
03:17:10.157 --> 03:17:12.339
(yelling)

4425
03:17:12.339 --> 03:17:14.349
MATT: You get toward the very edge,

4426
03:17:14.349 --> 03:17:16.935
and the handhold you have

4427
03:17:16.935 --> 03:17:19.726
breaks off and you plummet back.

4428
03:17:19.726 --> 03:17:21.658
Falling 60 feet downward--

4429
03:17:21.658 --> 03:17:23.016
SAM: I'll throw that feather out and,

4430
03:17:23.016 --> 03:17:24.266
even though it'll hurt me,

4431
03:17:24.266 --> 03:17:26.777
I'll cast Feather Fall.

4432
03:17:26.777 --> 03:17:28.375
MATT: You drift down. You watch upwards

4433
03:17:28.375 --> 03:17:32.944
as Nott's body goes into free trust fall position.

4434
03:17:32.944 --> 03:17:35.020
TALIESIN: That's going to hurt.
MATT: And it's beautiful.

4435
03:17:35.020 --> 03:17:36.847
And the mites drifting around, it's a beautiful visage.

4436
03:17:36.847 --> 03:17:41.301
All the mites (whooshes)--
SAM: (screams)

4437
03:17:41.301 --> 03:17:44.242
MATT: You take five points of lightning damage

4438
03:17:44.242 --> 03:17:46.410
and then drift, slightly fried, down to safety.

4439
03:17:46.410 --> 03:17:48.851
LAURA: Is it concentration, Feather Fall?

4440
03:17:48.851 --> 03:17:52.498
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

4441
03:17:52.498 --> 03:17:55.096
LAURA: No.
SAM: It lasts a minute.

4442
03:17:55.096 --> 03:17:57.065
MATT: It's not concentration.

4443
03:17:57.065 --> 03:17:59.997
(laughter)

4444
03:17:59.997 --> 03:18:01.920
TALIESIN: I don't suppose if it's up, if you climb--

4445
03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:04.416
no, because once you land, it's over, never mind.

4446
03:18:04.416 --> 03:18:06.692
LIAM: While all that happened, Caleb reached that

4447
03:18:06.692 --> 03:18:10.481
red-themed door and inspected it to see

4448
03:18:10.481 --> 03:18:12.342
if there is any arcane writing or

4449
03:18:12.342 --> 03:18:16.746
anything that looks nefarious or dangerous to touch.

4450
03:18:16.746 --> 03:18:18.037
MATT: You're inspecting it for traps and dangers.

4451
03:18:18.037 --> 03:18:19.501
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: Okay, what'd you roll?

4452
03:18:19.501 --> 03:18:21.668
LIAM: I didn't.
MATT: Oh, roll now.

4453
03:18:23.506 --> 03:18:24.339
LIAM: That is

4454
03:18:25.264 --> 03:18:26.206
25.

4455
03:18:26.206 --> 03:18:28.092
MATT: 25, good roll.

4456
03:18:28.092 --> 03:18:30.149
Looking at it, does not appear to be locked,

4457
03:18:30.149 --> 03:18:33.815
does not appear to have any traps about the doorway.

4458
03:18:33.815 --> 03:18:36.545
LIAM: (quickly exhaling)

4459
03:18:36.545 --> 03:18:39.753
Barely audible: I'm checking the door.

4460
03:18:39.753 --> 03:18:40.586
LAURA: Uh-uh!

4461
03:18:42.011 --> 03:18:43.372
LIAM: Try to pull it.

4462
03:18:43.372 --> 03:18:47.569
MATT: (clicking, creaks) It opens up.

4463
03:18:47.569 --> 03:18:49.283
LIAM: Frumpkin's next to me.

4464
03:18:49.283 --> 03:18:52.430
Go in, tell me what you see.

4465
03:18:52.430 --> 03:18:55.883
MATT: Frumpkin steps past you into the doorway

4466
03:18:55.883 --> 03:18:59.184
and you watch Frumpkin enter this shadow space

4467
03:18:59.184 --> 03:19:03.058
then vanish.

4468
03:19:03.058 --> 03:19:06.641
LIAM: I will wait until everyone pulls me away.

4469
03:19:07.726 --> 03:19:08.866
Hopefully he'll come back.

4470
03:19:08.866 --> 03:19:12.164
MATT: You don't sense anything about Frumpkin at all.

4471
03:19:12.164 --> 03:19:13.223
LAURA: Should we gather up?

4472
03:19:13.223 --> 03:19:14.525
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl back down
and start gathering everybody

4473
03:19:14.525 --> 03:19:16.542
because I think we need Beau to get up to this one.

4474
03:19:16.542 --> 03:19:19.127
MARISHA: Fjord and Beau come over.

4475
03:19:19.127 --> 03:19:20.771
LAURA: What do you guys think, where should we go?

4476
03:19:20.771 --> 03:19:22.900
TRAVIS: Well, if it leads to the study,

4477
03:19:22.900 --> 03:19:24.442
that's not where we're trying to go.

4478
03:19:24.442 --> 03:19:27.031
SAM: We need to find this thing up here.

4479
03:19:27.031 --> 03:19:29.932
TALIESIN: I think the Crystal Cave is above us.

4480
03:19:29.932 --> 03:19:32.516
SAM: There's no way you can climb it. It's impossible.

4481
03:19:32.516 --> 03:19:33.349
I tried.

4482
03:19:34.525 --> 03:19:37.312
MARISHA: You know this shit will work on me, don't you?

4483
03:19:37.312 --> 03:19:40.172
SAM: No, it's impossible, I wouldn't want you to fall.

4484
03:19:40.172 --> 03:19:41.662
Please don't fall.

4485
03:19:41.662 --> 03:19:45.983
LAURA: The Traveler thinks you're really cool.

4486
03:19:45.983 --> 03:19:48.236
SAM: Or you know, you could just Polymorph and carry us up.

4487
03:19:48.236 --> 03:19:50.703
MARISHA: Validation! And I go.

4488
03:19:50.703 --> 03:19:52.884
MATT: Okay, athletics check.

4489
03:19:52.884 --> 03:19:55.642
TRAVIS: My god, I want to go every single place.

4490
03:19:55.642 --> 03:19:57.194
TALIESIN: Caleb, we're doing a thing.

4491
03:19:57.194 --> 03:19:59.260
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, we are?
MARISHA: Which one, which one?

4492
03:19:59.260 --> 03:20:01.622
TALIESIN: Yeah, you should-- just in case.

4493
03:20:01.622 --> 03:20:03.483
MARISHA: You said athletics?
MATT: Yes.

4494
03:20:03.483 --> 03:20:04.516
MARISHA: 20.

4495
03:20:04.516 --> 03:20:07.540
MATT: You manage to make it halfway with a roll of 20.

4496
03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:10.623
MARISHA: I also, you know, Unarmored Movement.

4497
03:20:10.623 --> 03:20:14.324
My movement up walls is, like, awesome.

4498
03:20:14.324 --> 03:20:16.239
SAM: Oh fuck!
MATT: Oh, that's right.

4499
03:20:16.239 --> 03:20:19.298
TRAVIS: You have the same thing?
SAM: I have Spider Climb.

4500
03:20:19.298 --> 03:20:23.790
(laughter)

4501
03:20:23.790 --> 03:20:25.006
TALIESIN: You know, I'm just going to say,

4502
03:20:25.006 --> 03:20:29.500
we're going to get so much cool stuff when you finally go.

4503
03:20:29.500 --> 03:20:31.437
SAM: I forgot how to use spells!

4504
03:20:31.437 --> 03:20:34.196
TALIESIN: We're going to have no idea
what you have on your body.

4505
03:20:34.196 --> 03:20:35.696
TRAVIS: Fucking amazing!

4506
03:20:37.091 --> 03:20:38.635
MATT: Yeah, I'll say with a roll of 20

4507
03:20:38.635 --> 03:20:41.798
and your Unarmored Movement, and following

4508
03:20:41.798 --> 03:20:45.130
the path that Nott had skittered up,

4509
03:20:45.130 --> 03:20:47.361
you make it up to the ledge without issue.

4510
03:20:47.361 --> 03:20:49.442
MARISHA: I see where you broke off here.

4511
03:20:49.442 --> 03:20:52.933
That's pretty good, yeah, it's like a little cavern.

4512
03:20:52.933 --> 03:20:55.081
Anyway, I made it!

4513
03:20:55.081 --> 03:20:56.786
LAURA: Can you lower a rope?

4514
03:20:56.786 --> 03:20:58.867
TALIESIN: And what's it look like?
MARISHA: What's it look like?

4515
03:20:58.867 --> 03:21:00.331
First one to check it out.

4516
03:21:00.331 --> 03:21:02.082
MATT: Okay, you're standing at the edge of the cavern.

4517
03:21:02.082 --> 03:21:04.865
You can see the tunnel continues inward

4518
03:21:04.865 --> 03:21:08.258
about 10 or so feet before darkness takes it.

4519
03:21:08.258 --> 03:21:09.978
It winds down to a singular,

4520
03:21:09.978 --> 03:21:13.656
it's about 15 feet wide and about eight feet tall

4521
03:21:13.656 --> 03:21:15.844
and about 10 feet or so in it all of a sudden

4522
03:21:15.844 --> 03:21:17.431
shrinks down like a funnel

4523
03:21:17.431 --> 03:21:20.523
to a five-foot tall, two foot wide space that

4524
03:21:20.523 --> 03:21:22.491
you'd have to uncomfortably, or at least most people here

4525
03:21:22.491 --> 03:21:25.314
would have to uncomfortably slump into to continue forward.

4526
03:21:25.314 --> 03:21:27.795
MARISHA: Anything around it that indicates

4527
03:21:27.795 --> 03:21:32.393
it's crystal-y or mine-y, like a crystal-y mine?

4528
03:21:32.393 --> 03:21:35.311
MATT: Make a perception check.
LIAM: Mine crystals, crys-mines?

4529
03:21:35.311 --> 03:21:36.685
TALIESIN: Any crystals flying.

4530
03:21:36.685 --> 03:21:39.401
MATT: Count of Monte Mine Crystals?

4531
03:21:39.401 --> 03:21:40.463
LIAM: Nice.

4532
03:21:40.463 --> 03:21:41.997
MARISHA: Nine.

4533
03:21:41.997 --> 03:21:46.164
MATT: No, it looks like raw rock and mystery ahead.

4534
03:21:47.400 --> 03:21:48.971
MARISHA: Okay, I lean over. Yeah, it definitely feels like

4535
03:21:48.971 --> 03:21:51.980
a door to another thing.

4536
03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:56.313
LAURA: You think maybe I should call Allura or something?

4537
03:21:57.759 --> 03:21:58.592
TALIESIN: I think we're

4538
03:21:58.592 --> 03:21:59.979
jumping the gun yet.
SAM: We don't know what we're

4539
03:21:59.979 --> 03:22:02.668
doing yet. We need to figure out what's in that door.

4540
03:22:02.668 --> 03:22:04.950
TALIESIN: Can you lower a rope or something?

4541
03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:08.650
MARISHA: Yeah. Fjord and I also, you know, found,

4542
03:22:08.650 --> 03:22:09.708
yeah, hang on,

4543
03:22:09.708 --> 03:22:13.799
let me get out my rope, we found a hole in a knot

4544
03:22:13.799 --> 03:22:18.446
also probably a door to another place.

4545
03:22:18.446 --> 03:22:20.235
LAURA: Hey, don't you think,

4546
03:22:20.235 --> 03:22:24.476
what if like the Tower entrance would be up high

4547
03:22:24.476 --> 03:22:27.009
because it's a tower?

4548
03:22:27.009 --> 03:22:29.863
TRAVIS: Perhaps.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

4549
03:22:29.863 --> 03:22:32.253
and I try and fashion--

4550
03:22:32.253 --> 03:22:35.123
do I see like a rock or something I can loop?

4551
03:22:35.123 --> 03:22:36.945
MATT: No, it's a smooth cavern.

4552
03:22:36.945 --> 03:22:38.192
You'd have to hold it.
TRAVIS: I'm sure either way

4553
03:22:38.192 --> 03:22:39.524
we can get there.

4554
03:22:39.524 --> 03:22:41.582
MATT: You have a grappling hook?
TRAVIS: What is a dreadnought?

4555
03:22:41.582 --> 03:22:42.973
MARISHA: I have that.

4556
03:22:42.973 --> 03:22:45.446
LAURA: (unsure sounds)

4557
03:22:45.446 --> 03:22:46.729
SAM: How long is your rope?
MARISHA: Would any of us know what a

4558
03:22:46.729 --> 03:22:47.562
dreadnought is?

4559
03:22:47.562 --> 03:22:49.579
50 feet, basic.
MATT: Make an arcana check.

4560
03:22:50.457 --> 03:22:52.738
Both of you can make an arcana check.

4561
03:22:52.738 --> 03:22:53.914
LIAM: I'm not paying attention to any of that.

4562
03:22:53.914 --> 03:22:55.306
MATT: That's right, you are down--

4563
03:22:55.306 --> 03:22:57.658
LIAM: Staring at the darkness of this door.

4564
03:22:57.658 --> 03:23:00.857
MARISHA: 12!
MATT: Doesn't ring a bell.

4565
03:23:00.857 --> 03:23:04.219
SAM: I'm going to jump up
and try to climb the rope up there.

4566
03:23:04.219 --> 03:23:05.688
MATT: Easily enough with Beau's help.

4567
03:23:05.688 --> 03:23:08.055
Yeah, that's easy, you don't have to roll for that.

4568
03:23:08.055 --> 03:23:10.631
She's just helping you up at this point.

4569
03:23:10.631 --> 03:23:11.464
MARISHA: What do we do?

4570
03:23:11.464 --> 03:23:12.841
SAM: I do have a grappling hook.

4571
03:23:12.841 --> 03:23:14.337
LAURA: Help me up.

4572
03:23:14.337 --> 03:23:17.097
SAM: I'll tie a grappling hook and set it.

4573
03:23:17.097 --> 03:23:18.909
MATT: With that, it's easy enough for the rest of you guys

4574
03:23:18.909 --> 03:23:20.512
to use the rope to climb, it takes a little bit of time,

4575
03:23:20.512 --> 03:23:22.539
but you get up there.
LAURA: See any crystals up here

4576
03:23:22.539 --> 03:23:23.902
or anything?
MARISHA: No, I checked.

4577
03:23:23.902 --> 03:23:26.005
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at this thing.

4578
03:23:26.005 --> 03:23:28.207
Take a smell, see what's coming out of there.

4579
03:23:28.207 --> 03:23:29.142
MATT: Make a perception check.

4580
03:23:29.142 --> 03:23:31.334
MARISHA: You might have better luck, though.

4581
03:23:31.334 --> 03:23:32.775
SAM: Can I go investigate the door,

4582
03:23:32.775 --> 03:23:34.483
or that's what he's doing?

4583
03:23:34.483 --> 03:23:36.590
TALIESIN: 17.
MATT: No door currently, it's just a tunnel.

4584
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:37.548
17?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4585
03:23:37.548 --> 03:23:39.811
Going to get way up to it.

4586
03:23:39.811 --> 03:23:41.228
MATT: There's no door.

4587
03:23:41.228 --> 03:23:43.174
TALIESIN: I know.
MATT: Right to where it pincers?

4588
03:23:43.174 --> 03:23:45.207
TALIESIN: A little bit in there, yeah.

4589
03:23:45.207 --> 03:23:49.630
MATT: Okay, take a smell. Smells metallic.

4590
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:51.094
LAURA: Ooh, I bet it's the Tower, you guys.

4591
03:23:51.094 --> 03:23:53.303
TALIESIN: My feeling is the Tower, I'm feeling Tower here.

4592
03:23:53.303 --> 03:23:54.373
LAURA: I bet it's the Tower.

4593
03:23:54.373 --> 03:23:56.055
SAM: That's one of the right ways.

4594
03:23:56.055 --> 03:23:57.429
MARISHA: Okay.

4595
03:23:57.429 --> 03:23:59.537
TRAVIS: That would be my preferred way.

4596
03:23:59.537 --> 03:24:02.005
MARISHA: If we think the other one is the study,

4597
03:24:02.005 --> 03:24:04.098
then the one in the knot in the tree must be

4598
03:24:04.098 --> 03:24:05.795
TRAVIS and MARISHA: The Crystal Mines?

4599
03:24:05.795 --> 03:24:07.077
TRAVIS: Or this is the Crystal Mines

4600
03:24:07.077 --> 03:24:08.389
and the one in the tree leads--

4601
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:09.633
LAURA: No, I bet this is the Tower,

4602
03:24:09.633 --> 03:24:11.584
it's up high, towers are high.

4603
03:24:11.584 --> 03:24:15.140
TALIESIN: Half the tower's high, the other half is low.

4604
03:24:15.140 --> 03:24:18.041
MARISHA: The mines could also smell metallic.

4605
03:24:18.041 --> 03:24:20.995
Maybe Crystal Mines is just a name, but it's still

4606
03:24:20.995 --> 03:24:21.828
a mine. I don't know.

4607
03:24:21.828 --> 03:24:23.285
TALIESIN: Let me see this other door.

4608
03:24:23.285 --> 03:24:26.502
TRAVIS: You mine metals out of the earth.

4609
03:24:26.502 --> 03:24:30.539
MARISHA: But maybe you mine crystals
out of the Crystal Mine!

4610
03:24:30.539 --> 03:24:33.991
LAURA: Yeah, you probably mine crystals.

4611
03:24:33.991 --> 03:24:37.908
I bet it's like amethyst and like quartz, opal.

4612
03:24:39.223 --> 03:24:40.951
MARISHA: Fjord, you're still down there, right?

4613
03:24:40.951 --> 03:24:42.400
Did you climb up yet?

4614
03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:43.585
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading down.

4615
03:24:43.585 --> 03:24:47.706
MARISHA: Fjord will show you, where the, yeah.

4616
03:24:47.706 --> 03:24:49.630
TRAVIS: I'll lead you over to the Jack Skellington tree.

4617
03:24:49.630 --> 03:24:51.196
TALIESIN: Before we go down, I'm going to

4618
03:24:51.196 --> 03:24:53.196
pop my head in on Caleb.

4619
03:24:54.062 --> 03:24:54.979
Caleb?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>?

4620
03:24:56.437 --> 03:24:58.847
TALIESIN: You know, he's already been in there,

4621
03:24:58.847 --> 03:25:00.864
if that's where I think you're thinking about,

4622
03:25:00.864 --> 03:25:01.863
which means he's probably already gotten

4623
03:25:01.863 --> 03:25:03.439
all the good stuff out of there.

4624
03:25:03.439 --> 03:25:04.683
LIAM: Maybe.

4625
03:25:04.683 --> 03:25:06.399
TALIESIN: You can ask him when we find him.

4626
03:25:06.399 --> 03:25:07.232
LIAM: Maybe.

4627
03:25:08.374 --> 03:25:10.927
TALIESIN: Don't do anything foolish?

4628
03:25:10.927 --> 03:25:12.404
LIAM: What are we doing?

4629
03:25:12.404 --> 03:25:14.262
TALIESIN: We're checking the final door to see

4630
03:25:14.262 --> 03:25:15.462
where it goes.

4631
03:25:15.462 --> 03:25:19.255
LIAM: Yeah, let's check it.
TALIESIN: Okay.

4632
03:25:19.255 --> 03:25:21.246
TRAVIS: Does he want to join us?

4633
03:25:21.246 --> 03:25:23.837
TALIESIN: He's thinking about stuff.

4634
03:25:23.837 --> 03:25:26.145
LAURA: Ask him if he knows what a Dreadnought is!

4635
03:25:26.145 --> 03:25:27.486
TALIESIN: You know what a dreadnought is?

4636
03:25:27.486 --> 03:25:29.347
LIAM: Do I know what a dreadnought is?

4637
03:25:29.347 --> 03:25:31.180
MATT: Huh?
LIAM: Do I know what a dreadnought is?

4638
03:25:31.180 --> 03:25:33.176
MATT: Make an arcana check.

4639
03:25:33.176 --> 03:25:35.294
LIAM: Nope.

4640
03:25:35.294 --> 03:25:36.258
It's a 13.

4641
03:25:36.258 --> 03:25:37.425
MATT: 13, no idea.

4642
03:25:38.558 --> 03:25:41.081
You know what the word means, but you don't know what--

4643
03:25:41.081 --> 03:25:42.039
LAURA: What does the word mean?

4644
03:25:42.039 --> 03:25:44.597
I don't even know that.
TRAVIS: I don't either.

4645
03:25:45.526 --> 03:25:48.793
MATT: Best you can ascertain, something that is

4646
03:25:48.793 --> 03:25:52.123
dangerous, unstoppable.
TRAVIS: Oh, good, sure.

4647
03:25:52.123 --> 03:25:54.279
LAURA: Let's do the Tower, I think.

4648
03:25:54.279 --> 03:25:57.849
LIAM: Dreadnoughts are bad guys in G.I. Joe.

4649
03:25:57.849 --> 03:26:00.688
LAURA: Let's do the Tower.
LIAM: Zartan, you know.

4650
03:26:00.688 --> 03:26:04.921
TRAVIS: If it goes to the Tower.
LAURA: I think it does.

4651
03:26:04.921 --> 03:26:06.681
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take a look at that last door

4652
03:26:06.681 --> 03:26:10.284
that you got and give it good look once over.

4653
03:26:10.284 --> 03:26:11.132
MATT: The one that Fjord leads you to?

4654
03:26:11.132 --> 03:26:11.965
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4655
03:26:11.965 --> 03:26:13.620
You climb back down, head over to the side,

4656
03:26:13.620 --> 03:26:15.732
you see the same knot, and for you it's very small.

4657
03:26:15.732 --> 03:26:18.269
In order to even step inside, you'd have to get real low

4658
03:26:18.269 --> 03:26:19.706
and squeeze around the corner.

4659
03:26:19.706 --> 03:26:21.607
TALIESIN: Get in there a bit, take a whiff.

4660
03:26:21.607 --> 03:26:23.507
MATT: Make a perception check.

4661
03:26:23.507 --> 03:26:25.509
TALIESIN: Ooh, 23!

4662
03:26:29.376 --> 03:26:32.181
MATT: It smells earthy, similar to the space around you,

4663
03:26:32.181 --> 03:26:34.176
with a slight bit of dampness

4664
03:26:34.176 --> 03:26:37.286
that's dissimilar to the moisture and

4665
03:26:37.286 --> 03:26:39.953
humid atmosphere of this jungle.

4666
03:26:42.750 --> 03:26:45.667
TALIESIN: I feel like I can make an
educated guess there, all right.

4667
03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:50.699
Let's get together and maybe

4668
03:26:50.699 --> 03:26:52.875
does anyone want a short rest or something and we can--

4669
03:26:52.875 --> 03:26:55.331
LAURA: I feel that's what we've been doing.

4670
03:26:55.331 --> 03:26:56.747
MATT: Well, you've been investigating.

4671
03:26:56.747 --> 03:26:59.467
A short rest would be stop and rest.

4672
03:26:59.467 --> 03:27:01.472
MARISHA: So are we going to do the tower or the mines?

4673
03:27:01.472 --> 03:27:04.026
LIAM: I think we should take a short rest right here.

4674
03:27:04.026 --> 03:27:04.937
TALIESIN: And then we pick the door.

4675
03:27:04.937 --> 03:27:06.877
TRAVIS: Last question.
LAURA: Caleb, stop being weird!

4676
03:27:06.877 --> 03:27:09.402
TRAVIS: Last question, I know what we're going after,

4677
03:27:09.402 --> 03:27:12.482
I guess out of game. There's a bedroom on here.

4678
03:27:12.482 --> 03:27:14.265
Are we looking for him, are we just hoping

4679
03:27:14.265 --> 03:27:15.947
to find him along the way?

4680
03:27:15.947 --> 03:27:17.609
LAURA: We're not looking for--

4681
03:27:17.609 --> 03:27:19.215
TRAVIS: Ussa?
LAURA: No, we are.

4682
03:27:19.215 --> 03:27:21.157
But Ussa's not in the bedroom probably.

4683
03:27:21.157 --> 03:27:23.826
Ussa's probably going to the heart thing.

4684
03:27:23.826 --> 03:27:25.949
MARISHA: Deeper and deeper.

4685
03:27:25.949 --> 03:27:27.186
LIAM: He could be trapped,

4686
03:27:27.186 --> 03:27:30.244
he could be anything, and it's Yussa with a Y.

4687
03:27:30.244 --> 03:27:32.911
LAURA: Yussa.
TRAVIS: Fleshmend Facility...

4688
03:27:33.814 --> 03:27:34.647
SAM: Topaz...

4689
03:27:36.423 --> 03:27:37.661
LAURA and MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4690
03:27:37.661 --> 03:27:40.000
MARISHA: Tiger's Eye.
LIAM: Lapis lazuli.

4691
03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:42.097
LAURA: Is Tiger's Eye a crystal?

4692
03:27:42.097 --> 03:27:45.091
MARISHA: I guess it's more of a mineral.

4693
03:27:45.091 --> 03:27:46.410
MATT: You guys taking a short rest, then?

4694
03:27:46.410 --> 03:27:48.650
SAM: I guess?
TALIESIN: I think it's a good idea.

4695
03:27:48.650 --> 03:27:50.126
MATT: You can use your hit dice to

4696
03:27:50.126 --> 03:27:52.862
heal up a bit if you'd like.

4697
03:27:52.862 --> 03:27:55.040
MARISHA: Hey Caleb, you still staring at a door?

4698
03:27:55.040 --> 03:27:58.531
LIAM: My cat has wandered off.

4699
03:27:58.531 --> 03:27:59.630
Just waiting.

4700
03:27:59.630 --> 03:28:02.105
MARISHA: Cat's wandered off?
LIAM: Yeah.

4701
03:28:05.579 --> 03:28:08.162
MATT: There's no response, no return from Frumpkin.

4702
03:28:08.162 --> 03:28:09.813
After like 40 minutes.

4703
03:28:09.813 --> 03:28:12.787
LIAM: 40 minutes, that's how long? After a half hour,

4704
03:28:12.787 --> 03:28:14.977
I would go (snap).

4705
03:28:14.977 --> 03:28:18.469
MATT: Okay, Frumpkin returns.

4706
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:20.972
LIAM: Well, what did you see?

4707
03:28:20.972 --> 03:28:23.518
MATT: (meowing)

4708
03:28:23.518 --> 03:28:27.038
LIAM: I have a telepathic link.
MATT: I know, I know.

4709
03:28:27.038 --> 03:28:30.742
You see familiar images of the study

4710
03:28:30.742 --> 03:28:32.467
you had previously stumbled into

4711
03:28:32.467 --> 03:28:34.450
when you first came through the sphere.

4712
03:28:34.450 --> 03:28:38.810
The large stained glass window that contained

4713
03:28:40.368 --> 03:28:44.704
an imprint of various planes connected,

4714
03:28:44.704 --> 03:28:46.454
shelves and the desk,

4715
03:28:48.298 --> 03:28:50.474
almost no light but what little bit

4716
03:28:50.474 --> 03:28:51.586
of light there is in there

4717
03:28:51.586 --> 03:28:52.946
it looks like things have been tousled a bit,

4718
03:28:52.946 --> 03:28:57.029
like the chair of the desk has been knocked over.

4719
03:28:57.881 --> 03:28:59.321
LIAM: While resting, I ask Frumpkin:

4720
03:28:59.321 --> 03:29:03.064
Did you see a vanity that looks like

4721
03:29:03.064 --> 03:29:04.095
it had been hacked to pieces?

4722
03:29:04.095 --> 03:29:06.097
Because that's where we were attacked, right?

4723
03:29:06.097 --> 03:29:07.587
MATT: Yes.

4724
03:29:07.587 --> 03:29:11.027
LIAM: The guts of that, and I ask Frumpkin if he saw

4725
03:29:11.027 --> 03:29:13.442
the book that was so tempting to me

4726
03:29:13.442 --> 03:29:16.467
before we dove in after Fjord.

4727
03:29:16.467 --> 03:29:17.300
MATT: Right.

4728
03:29:18.554 --> 03:29:20.665
It looked like, because all the books

4729
03:29:20.665 --> 03:29:22.927
were locked in these large metal bars that were chained in.

4730
03:29:22.927 --> 03:29:26.273
The bars are open and the shelves are clear.

4731
03:29:26.273 --> 03:29:27.698
LIAM: Completely clear?

4732
03:29:29.342 --> 03:29:31.342
MATT: And the innards of the

4733
03:29:34.021 --> 03:29:36.094
the cabinet mimic that you had battled

4734
03:29:36.094 --> 03:29:40.193
still remained on the floor where it was left previously.

4735
03:29:40.193 --> 03:29:42.892
LIAM: So it looks like, best Frumpkin could tell,

4736
03:29:42.892 --> 03:29:44.450
it's been rolled.

4737
03:29:44.450 --> 03:29:46.640
MATT: To whatever extent, whatever came through.

4738
03:29:46.640 --> 03:29:48.336
TRAVIS: I feel so guilty.

4739
03:29:48.336 --> 03:29:53.126
SAM: You know, as we sit here resting, it occurs to me

4740
03:29:53.126 --> 03:29:55.293
as we sit around here that

4741
03:29:57.128 --> 03:30:00.501
Miss Elaina out there has been waiting for days

4742
03:30:00.501 --> 03:30:01.751
for us to return now.

4743
03:30:01.751 --> 03:30:03.142
LAURA: Oh jeez, you're right.
TRAVIS: Who?

4744
03:30:04.297 --> 03:30:05.251
SAM: Alanna?
LAURA and LIAM: Allura.

4745
03:30:05.251 --> 03:30:06.993
SAM: Alanna, it was Alanna.

4746
03:30:06.993 --> 03:30:08.317
LAURA: I should send her a message.

4747
03:30:08.317 --> 03:30:10.349
SAM: We should definitely send her a message.

4748
03:30:10.349 --> 03:30:11.182
LAURA: Should I send her a message, or

4749
03:30:11.182 --> 03:30:12.560
should I use this amazing mirror that she gave me?

4750
03:30:12.560 --> 03:30:14.664
SAM: The mirror!

4751
03:30:14.664 --> 03:30:16.348
LAURA: Communication lasts for up to 10 minutes,

4752
03:30:16.348 --> 03:30:18.464
I can use it three times a whole day.

4753
03:30:18.464 --> 03:30:19.657
SAM: Yeah.

4754
03:30:19.657 --> 03:30:21.824
TALIESIN: We should probably maintain contact

4755
03:30:21.824 --> 03:30:24.899
when we go through so we can describe what we see, maybe?

4756
03:30:26.093 --> 03:30:29.130
SAM: Oh, so cast it, talk to her, go through the thing

4757
03:30:29.130 --> 03:30:31.105
and keep talking?
LAURA: So right when we decide.

4758
03:30:31.105 --> 03:30:34.110
MARISHA: So you get two birds, one stone?

4759
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:35.704
SAM: Smart, Mr. Clay.

4760
03:30:35.704 --> 03:30:38.391
LAURA: Yeah, we'll cast it, talk to her for five minutes

4761
03:30:38.391 --> 03:30:42.545
and then go through. Okay, okay, okay, I like it.

4762
03:30:42.545 --> 03:30:44.996
Are we ready to go through?

4763
03:30:44.996 --> 03:30:48.176
TRAVIS: Well, no, Caduceus, Fjord, and Caleb

4764
03:30:48.176 --> 03:30:50.359
are still on the ground.

4765
03:30:50.359 --> 03:30:52.555
SAM: Well, climb up!
LAURA: We're been waiting for an hour.

4766
03:30:52.555 --> 03:30:54.280
The rope is down, we're on a short rest.

4767
03:30:54.280 --> 03:30:55.280
TRAVIS: I know, I'm just saying, that's where we are.

4768
03:30:55.280 --> 03:30:57.111
TALIESIN: Let's get up.

4769
03:30:57.111 --> 03:31:00.444
SAM: What are you guys doing down there?

4770
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:04.912
MATT: You guys complete a short rest.

4771
03:31:04.912 --> 03:31:06.628
Those of you who require short rest to restore

4772
03:31:06.628 --> 03:31:07.895
themselves in certain capabilities

4773
03:31:07.895 --> 03:31:09.633
or spells and abilities, those are restored.

4774
03:31:09.633 --> 03:31:11.835
You've used your hit dice to heal up.

4775
03:31:11.835 --> 03:31:14.373
What would you like to do?
SAM: Drink.

4776
03:31:14.373 --> 03:31:16.019
TALIESIN: Into the Machine, is that the conversation

4777
03:31:16.019 --> 03:31:17.680
we're all having, not the Crystal Cave?

4778
03:31:17.680 --> 03:31:18.954
LAURA: Right, the Tower.

4779
03:31:18.954 --> 03:31:21.047
TALIESIN: I will admit I'm a little disappointed, but I'm--

4780
03:31:21.047 --> 03:31:22.183
LAURA: Yeah, I know.

4781
03:31:22.183 --> 03:31:24.420
TALIESIN: It's a cave made of crystal. That can't hurt you.

4782
03:31:24.420 --> 03:31:26.445
LAURA: You remember when we saw a cave of crystals before

4783
03:31:26.445 --> 03:31:28.078
and they were so beautiful?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4784
03:31:28.078 --> 03:31:29.589
LAURA: It was so wonderful.
TALIESIN: It was great.

4785
03:31:29.589 --> 03:31:30.860
LAURA: I would love to see something like that again.

4786
03:31:30.860 --> 03:31:32.329
TALIESIN: Me too.

4787
03:31:32.329 --> 03:31:35.159
SAM: Is there anything in the information that we gleaned

4788
03:31:35.159 --> 03:31:38.434
from the libraries that would indicate that

4789
03:31:38.434 --> 03:31:41.017
a crystal cave is useful to us,

4790
03:31:42.205 --> 03:31:43.754
a connection to another plane of existence?

4791
03:31:43.754 --> 03:31:44.901
LAURA: Maybe we can ask Allura.

4792
03:31:44.901 --> 03:31:47.069
You know, she's been there for a week,

4793
03:31:47.069 --> 03:31:48.631
I bet she's done a lot of research in the time

4794
03:31:48.631 --> 03:31:50.421
that we've been gone, so maybe she'll know more

4795
03:31:50.421 --> 03:31:51.926
about each of the rooms!

4796
03:31:51.926 --> 03:31:53.126
MARISHA: That's true.

4797
03:31:53.126 --> 03:31:54.912
TALIESIN: Let's start it, we'll get up here,

4798
03:31:54.912 --> 03:31:57.319
we'll start it and then we'll tell her where we're going.

4799
03:31:57.319 --> 03:31:58.943
MARISHA: It is quicker to get down than get up.

4800
03:31:58.943 --> 03:32:00.855
LAURA: That's true, all right.

4801
03:32:00.855 --> 03:32:03.093
LIAM: DM, I also used Arcane Recovery on that short rest.

4802
03:32:03.093 --> 03:32:03.985
MATT: Right, so you got your spells.

4803
03:32:03.985 --> 03:32:06.060
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to do it, okay?

4804
03:32:06.060 --> 03:32:07.157
MARISHA: All right.

4805
03:32:07.157 --> 03:32:09.740
LAURA: I'm going to pull up the mirror.

4806
03:32:09.740 --> 03:32:12.164
MARISHA: Let's talk to Alyssa.
TRAVIS: That's a lollipop.

4807
03:32:12.164 --> 03:32:13.691
LAURA: Pretend it's a mirror.

4808
03:32:13.691 --> 03:32:17.669
TALIESIN: Alyssa explains it all.

4809
03:32:17.669 --> 03:32:22.669
LAURA: Allura, Allura, are you there?

4810
03:32:23.161 --> 03:32:25.940
SAM: Talk to a Jester quite so fair!

4811
03:32:25.940 --> 03:32:27.713
(laughter)

4812
03:32:27.713 --> 03:32:29.649
MATT: The reflection of your face goes cloudy

4813
03:32:29.649 --> 03:32:31.870
for a moment and swirls and then begins to reform

4814
03:32:31.870 --> 03:32:34.339
into the face of Allura Vysoren.

4815
03:32:34.339 --> 03:32:36.904
LAURA: How much time has passed?

4816
03:32:36.904 --> 03:32:39.046
MATT: "It's been nearly three days on this end."

4817
03:32:39.046 --> 03:32:41.432
LAURA: Whoa!
TALIESIN: That's crazy.

4818
03:32:41.432 --> 03:32:43.911
MATT: "I've been doing my best to research elements here.

4819
03:32:43.911 --> 03:32:45.226
"It seems that most of Yussa's notes

4820
03:32:45.226 --> 03:32:47.503
"were designed to not be pursued,

4821
03:32:47.503 --> 03:32:52.369
"so not much help about the actual interior, research-wise.

4822
03:32:52.369 --> 03:32:54.614
"I have done a bit of research on this

4823
03:32:54.614 --> 03:32:58.422
"Angel of Irons you've been speaking about."

4824
03:32:58.422 --> 03:33:00.939
"Not a whole lot to find here, though I do think

4825
03:33:00.939 --> 03:33:04.939
"I may have a divination spell that might

4826
03:33:04.939 --> 03:33:08.065
"hopefully pierce any sort of guise or

4827
03:33:08.065 --> 03:33:09.943
"veil of secrecy that it's keeping,

4828
03:33:09.943 --> 03:33:12.378
"but I will require you to be here

4829
03:33:12.378 --> 03:33:16.939
"and if you have any effects of a member of the cult at all,

4830
03:33:16.939 --> 03:33:19.122
"that might be helpful in gleaning information."

4831
03:33:19.122 --> 03:33:21.994
LAURA: Oh yeah, we've got stuff.

4832
03:33:21.994 --> 03:33:24.376
MATT: "Anyway, how goes it there? Please tell me."

4833
03:33:24.376 --> 03:33:26.359
LAURA: Okay, so we're in the Garden.

4834
03:33:26.359 --> 03:33:27.325
MATT: "Right."

4835
03:33:27.325 --> 03:33:29.267
LAURA: We fought a giant frog thing.

4836
03:33:29.267 --> 03:33:30.401
TRAVIS: It's only been a couple hours.

4837
03:33:30.401 --> 03:33:32.734
LAURA: It's only been a couple hours here.

4838
03:33:32.734 --> 03:33:34.708
We fought and we succeeded and we're all

4839
03:33:34.708 --> 03:33:36.877
healed up, we're good, we're good.

4840
03:33:36.877 --> 03:33:38.508
So now we're deciding where to go next.

4841
03:33:38.508 --> 03:33:42.959
We can go between the Tower or the Crystal Mines.

4842
03:33:42.959 --> 03:33:45.364
So what do you think is more dangerous?

4843
03:33:45.364 --> 03:33:48.114
A golem place or the dreadnought?

4844
03:33:52.993 --> 03:33:55.493
MATT: "Both seem capable of danger.

4845
03:33:58.453 --> 03:34:01.242
"I don't know necessarily what are in these places,

4846
03:34:01.242 --> 03:34:02.645
"I would hate to give an uninformed decision

4847
03:34:02.645 --> 03:34:05.398
"and send you to your doom.

4848
03:34:05.398 --> 03:34:08.202
"Is there anything else you can give me to help with this?"

4849
03:34:08.202 --> 03:34:11.018
TRAVIS: Tell her, on the map, the Tower Machine looks like

4850
03:34:11.018 --> 03:34:13.819
it has gears and some sort of machinery

4851
03:34:13.819 --> 03:34:16.449
and the Crystal Mine, the art does look

4852
03:34:16.449 --> 03:34:18.425
a bit like a toothy maw.

4853
03:34:18.425 --> 03:34:20.462
LAURA: Oh, it kind of does, yeah.

4854
03:34:20.462 --> 03:34:23.856
SAM: That could just be artistic expression, though.

4855
03:34:23.856 --> 03:34:27.114
LIAM: The eye sees what it wants to see.

4856
03:34:27.114 --> 03:34:30.283
SAM: Allura, did you find anything while sitting there

4857
03:34:30.283 --> 03:34:32.398
for three days that would indicate anything about

4858
03:34:32.398 --> 03:34:35.124
these Crystal Mines?

4859
03:34:35.124 --> 03:34:36.874
Any further research?

4860
03:34:37.746 --> 03:34:42.711
MATT: "Best that I can tell, many of the chambers in this

4861
03:34:42.711 --> 03:34:47.378
"this portion of the Folding Halls were designed

4862
03:34:47.378 --> 03:34:49.461
"specifically for Halas to

4863
03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:57.029
"reap and recover things for his research and maintenance.

4864
03:34:57.029 --> 03:34:59.589
"Looking at the spread here, it looks like there are things

03:35:02.758 --> 03:35:04.983
"for spellcraft and magical item creation,

03:35:04.983 --> 03:35:08.241
"enchantments, artifact design and development.

4868
03:35:08.241 --> 03:35:10.345
"There's a Golem Workshop; perhaps there

4869
03:35:10.345 --> 03:35:14.095
"is a space where he creates various servants.

4870
03:35:15.403 --> 03:35:19.403
"I don't know if you've recently come upon anyone

4871
03:35:20.836 --> 03:35:24.387
"or any creatures of golem construction."

4872
03:35:24.387 --> 03:35:26.118
MARISHA: We did previously.
TALIESIN: There were a bunch of frogs.

4873
03:35:26.118 --> 03:35:28.508
Oh yeah, that was that last time, I forgot about that.

4874
03:35:28.508 --> 03:35:31.877
LIAM: Before your time, Caduceus, we were visiting

4875
03:35:31.877 --> 03:35:35.189
a town called Hupperdook and we

4876
03:35:35.189 --> 03:35:37.044
tangled with a bit of clockwork.

4877
03:35:37.044 --> 03:35:39.012
TALIESIN: I was thinking of the magic cabinet.

4878
03:35:39.012 --> 03:35:40.879
MATT: "I mean within the premises there.

4879
03:35:40.879 --> 03:35:43.185
"If there is a Golem Workshop, there's probably

4880
03:35:43.185 --> 03:35:47.456
"golems somewhere, maybe not just in the workshop,

4881
03:35:47.456 --> 03:35:48.726
"so be on the lookout."

4882
03:35:48.726 --> 03:35:50.479
LAURA: I bet they'll be in the Tower Machine.

4883
03:35:50.479 --> 03:35:52.146
TRAVIS: And a dreadnought?

4884
03:35:53.054 --> 03:35:57.371
MATT: "Dreadnought? There is--"

4885
03:35:57.371 --> 03:35:59.954
SAM: She's making a history check?

4886
03:36:01.369 --> 03:36:03.673
MATT: "There are many things that can be a dreadnought.

4887
03:36:03.673 --> 03:36:05.756
"It is a descriptive term.

4888
03:36:08.065 --> 03:36:09.907
"I can begin to research

4889
03:36:09.907 --> 03:36:12.216
"if you'd like. It might take a little bit of time."

4890
03:36:12.216 --> 03:36:13.769
SAM: Sure, we'll call you in 10 minutes,

4891
03:36:13.769 --> 03:36:17.093
which will be two days later for you.

4892
03:36:17.093 --> 03:36:18.655
MATT: "Judging by the time passage there,

4893
03:36:18.655 --> 03:36:20.580
"you said it had been two to three hours?

4894
03:36:20.580 --> 03:36:22.734
"Looks to be about an hour per day transition,

4895
03:36:22.734 --> 03:36:23.846
"so keep that in mind."

4896
03:36:23.846 --> 03:36:25.312
LAURA: Oh, well.

4897
03:36:25.312 --> 03:36:26.636
MATT: "So far."

4898
03:36:26.636 --> 03:36:29.930
"Who knows if all the chambers are consistent."

4899
03:36:29.930 --> 03:36:31.179
SAM: I think we go into the Tower.

4900
03:36:31.179 --> 03:36:33.106
TALIESIN: I think we should regardless probably

4901
03:36:33.106 --> 03:36:35.814
make a decision and move.

4902
03:36:35.814 --> 03:36:37.080
That way, at least,

4903
03:36:37.080 --> 03:36:38.680
we'll have a path forward.
LAURA: The Tower Machine

4904
03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:41.196
also leads to the Arcane Armory

4905
03:36:41.196 --> 03:36:43.842
and he has a lot of markings by the Arcane Armory.

4906
03:36:43.842 --> 03:36:45.539
So maybe it's an important room.

4907
03:36:45.539 --> 03:36:48.744
SAM: Or maybe there's some
cool weapons and protections there.

4908
03:36:48.744 --> 03:36:51.100
MATT: (distant thudding)
LAURA: I think we should do the tower.

4909
03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:52.525
MATT: (louder thudding)
SAM: Uh-oh!

4910
03:36:52.525 --> 03:36:53.592
LAURA: What is that?

4911
03:36:53.592 --> 03:36:57.974
MATT: You hear the crunching of natural sounds,

4912
03:36:57.974 --> 03:37:01.724
wood and rock being pushed or plowed through.

4913
03:37:02.914 --> 03:37:04.695
You are all up on the ledge, looking in towards

4914
03:37:04.695 --> 03:37:08.361
the dark cavern above on the mountainside, correct?

4915
03:37:08.361 --> 03:37:11.692
Looking down amongst the brush below,

4916
03:37:11.692 --> 03:37:15.865
you see a 10-15 foot tall

4917
03:37:15.865 --> 03:37:17.819
humanoid being made of polished,

4918
03:37:17.819 --> 03:37:20.652
smooth stone with metallic joints.

4919
03:37:21.928 --> 03:37:22.953
The faceless

4920
03:37:24.235 --> 03:37:26.106
and reminiscent of the creature

4921
03:37:26.106 --> 03:37:28.095
or shape you saw embedded in the ceiling

4922
03:37:28.095 --> 03:37:33.075
of the chamber you arrived in, now emblazoned with runes

4923
03:37:33.075 --> 03:37:35.982
and where one of its hands is

4924
03:37:35.982 --> 03:37:39.383
you can see some sort of a claw, an open, C-like claw.

4925
03:37:39.383 --> 03:37:41.045
LAURA: Oh, if you hang out in the room too long,

4926
03:37:41.045 --> 03:37:42.315
the golems come after you.

4927
03:37:42.315 --> 03:37:44.342
MARISHA: Or it follows you from room to room.

4928
03:37:44.342 --> 03:37:45.175
LAURA: Let's get out of here.

4929
03:37:45.175 --> 03:37:46.544
MATT: As you look down at it,

4930
03:37:46.544 --> 03:37:48.028
you see its face (whirs) look up

4931
03:37:48.028 --> 03:37:49.389
and there's just a single glowing sigil

4932
03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:53.059
where its face would be that seems focused on all of you.

4933
03:37:53.059 --> 03:37:55.438
TALIESIN: Let's go!
MARISHA: (yells)

4934
03:37:55.438 --> 03:37:56.936
Jumping into the cavern.

4935
03:37:56.936 --> 03:37:58.298
MATT: You all jump through the cavern, all right.

4936
03:37:58.298 --> 03:38:00.742
One by one, you leap through into the darkness.

4937
03:38:00.742 --> 03:38:02.984
The tunnel seems to pull you forward like a vacuum.

4938
03:38:02.984 --> 03:38:05.155
In that moment where your feet

4939
03:38:05.155 --> 03:38:08.014
leave the ground, the suction being so strong,

4940
03:38:08.014 --> 03:38:09.935
the darkness all of a sudden is lifted

4941
03:38:09.935 --> 03:38:11.713
like you've been thrust through a curtain of some kind,

4942
03:38:11.713 --> 03:38:14.008
and your feet find a stone floor.

4943
03:38:14.008 --> 03:38:16.673
Looking up around you, you stand on a ledge

4944
03:38:16.673 --> 03:38:19.088
made of stone and metal.

4945
03:38:19.088 --> 03:38:21.599
You look over what looks like a curving expanse,

4946
03:38:21.599 --> 03:38:25.816
a maelstrom of black and purple clouds and swirling energy.

4947
03:38:25.816 --> 03:38:27.828
On all sides before you,

4948
03:38:27.828 --> 03:38:30.450
an endless expanse of nothingness with little hints

4949
03:38:30.450 --> 03:38:34.639
of distance rock just slowing drifting through the space.

4950
03:38:34.639 --> 03:38:36.376
Looking around behind you, you can see--

4951
03:38:36.376 --> 03:38:38.479
LAURA: I flip the mirror around so Allura can see

4952
03:38:38.479 --> 03:38:40.626
everything that we're seeing.
MATT: Immense in size

4953
03:38:40.626 --> 03:38:43.186
and nearly infinite,

4954
03:38:43.186 --> 03:38:46.625
a pillar or a tower or a construct

4955
03:38:46.625 --> 03:38:48.979
of strange shape and design.

4956
03:38:48.979 --> 03:38:51.895
Parts of metal and offshoot chambers

4957
03:38:51.895 --> 03:38:54.597
and bits of heavy gears grinding and shifting.

4958
03:38:54.597 --> 03:38:57.108
Bits of brass and platinum

4959
03:38:57.108 --> 03:38:59.224
bent around adamantine pistons

4960
03:38:59.224 --> 03:39:03.403
and it curves slightly for miles and miles from end to end.

4961
03:39:03.403 --> 03:39:05.841
Looking up on one side to the other,

4962
03:39:05.841 --> 03:39:08.010
the immensity of it gives you instantaneous vertigo

4963
03:39:08.010 --> 03:39:09.242
and you find yourself instinctively

4964
03:39:09.242 --> 03:39:11.418
getting low to the ground, holding onto this ledge.

4965
03:39:11.418 --> 03:39:13.193
A flash of purple lightning

4966
03:39:13.193 --> 03:39:16.259
lights up the vicinity around you.

4967
03:39:16.259 --> 03:39:17.765
And you look back to the map,

4968
03:39:17.765 --> 03:39:20.274
and you suddenly see that shape drawn through

4969
03:39:20.274 --> 03:39:22.736
the center of its design.

4970
03:39:22.736 --> 03:39:25.554
You stand somewhere along

4971
03:39:25.554 --> 03:39:27.970
whatever this device may be.

4972
03:39:27.970 --> 03:39:30.601
The wind blowing and tousling your hair,

4973
03:39:30.601 --> 03:39:32.698
the sound causing you to speak at a volume

4974
03:39:32.698 --> 03:39:34.088
to where you can actually reach

4975
03:39:34.088 --> 03:39:37.288
other's ears from a distance.

4976
03:39:37.288 --> 03:39:38.780
And that's where we'll leave

4977
03:39:38.780 --> 03:39:41.091
for next week.
ALL: Oh!

4978
03:39:41.091 --> 03:39:42.401
SAM: Fuck you.

4979
03:39:42.401 --> 03:39:45.151
TRAVIS: Yes!
(clapping)

4980
03:39:46.184 --> 03:39:48.959
SAM: Oh man.
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (moaning)

4981
03:39:48.959 --> 03:39:50.684
LAURA: Oh god!

4982
03:39:50.684 --> 03:39:53.382
TRAVIS: I love it, I love it!

4983
03:39:53.382 --> 03:39:55.429
SAM: We've got golems, we got Allura,

4984
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:59.046
we got a dungeon crawl, we got a map.

4985
03:39:59.046 --> 03:40:01.241
TRAVIS: We got to find those two doors.
LAURA: This is the best!

4986
03:40:01.241 --> 03:40:04.019
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Oh man, oh man.

4987
03:40:04.019 --> 03:40:06.823
LIAM: (like Kermit the Frog) ♪ Why are there are so many ♪

4988
03:40:06.823 --> 03:40:10.016
♪ Songs about Halas ♪

4989
03:40:10.016 --> 03:40:13.715
♪ And what's on other side ♪

4990
03:40:13.715 --> 03:40:15.733
SAM: We killed Kermit in this game.

4991
03:40:15.733 --> 03:40:18.267
LAURA: There's a secondary map we have to figure out.

4992
03:40:18.267 --> 03:40:19.919
Down here.

4993
03:40:19.919 --> 03:40:22.049
TRAVIS: It is just a portion of a tower.

4994
03:40:22.049 --> 03:40:23.998
MARISHA: We're in the engine of the Happy Fun Ball.

4995
03:40:23.998 --> 03:40:27.498
MATT: That is as much as Yussa has mapped out.

4996
03:40:28.909 --> 03:40:30.740
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4997
03:40:30.740 --> 03:40:32.318
Cool, cool cool cool.

4998
03:40:32.318 --> 03:40:35.735
MATT: From what you previously heard and Allura confirmed,

4999
03:40:35.735 --> 03:40:38.389
100 or more chambers within the Folding Halls.

5000
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:40.871
LAURA: Jesus Christ.

5001
03:40:40.871 --> 03:40:41.997
TALIESIN: We cool, we cool.

5002
03:40:41.997 --> 03:40:45.838
MATT: We'll pick up there next week and see where this--

5003
03:40:45.838 --> 03:40:46.822
SAM: We'll post this picture somewhere.

5004
03:40:46.822 --> 03:40:49.123
MATT: Yeah, if you want, you can put it online.

5005
03:40:49.123 --> 03:40:50.972
Thank you guys so much for joining us.

5006
03:40:50.972 --> 03:40:52.785
Thank you to our fantastic sponsors.

5007
03:40:52.785 --> 03:40:54.390
We love you very much and

5008
03:40:54.390 --> 03:40:55.714
is it Thursday yet?

5009
03:40:55.714 --> 03:40:57.914
Good night!

5010
03:40:57.914 --> 03:41:02.847
(dramatic orchestral music)

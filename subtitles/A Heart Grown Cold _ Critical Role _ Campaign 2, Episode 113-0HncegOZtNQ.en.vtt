00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.581
MATT: Hello everybody, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:03.790
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.446
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:08.363
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
(all clamoring)

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.380
MATT: Happy to have you back.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.570
Before we get into tonight's episode,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.770
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.553
beginning with the first of our
two sponsors for the evening.

00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:19.545
The first up, which is Ravensburger. Sam.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.300
SAM: (scoffing)
No, Matt, please,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.980
do not use my secret identity,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.580
for the world only knows me as the notorious Boomerang.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.040
No?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.231
Boomerang?

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:33.290
LIAM: Oh.
SAM: Boomerang, the orbital outlaw?

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.560
The Sinister Stick, the Aerodynamic Desperado?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.735
No? Boomerang?

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:39.642
Not ringing a bell?
TRAVIS: Terrible name.

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:40.900
SAM: Cool, cool, anyway,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.850
this episode is sponsored by Marvel Villainous,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.460
from our friends at Ravensburger.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.300
The next chapter of the villainous game system

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.910
allows players to take on the role of a Marvel villain

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.776
of their choice and face off
against Earth's mightiest heroes

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:55.749
to achieve their dastardly objectives.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.972
Players can choose from Thanos, Hela, Killmonger,

00:00:58.972 --> 00:01:02.520
Ultron, Taskmaster from the upcoming Black Widow film,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.713
and of course...

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.114
Boomerang isn't an option.

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:08.960
LAURA: (laughs)

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.420
SAM: No Boomerang?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.840
Boomerang, the spinniest supervillain of them all?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.673
No?

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:14.506
MARISHA: "Spinniest"?

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:16.500
SAM: Goddamn it, I'm going to kill my agent.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.920
She said this was in the bag!

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.757
I even wrote some new catch phrases, ready?

00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:22.492
MATT: Oh, no.
SAM: "Okay, boomer!"

00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:23.758
Eh? No?

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:25.180
ALL: (groaning)

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.693
SAM: How about, "You rang?"

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.121
No?
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.238
MARISHA: Okay, okay.
LIAM: Fuck you.

00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:33.511
It's so quiet in here.

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.475
MATT: (laughs)

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:36.766
SAM: "Ya!"

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.640
Of course, in real life it would come back,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.340
I know how to use a boomerang.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
SAM: Anyway.

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:46.222
The game is available now in the U.S. and U.K. at

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:49.173
bit.ly/critrolemarvelvillainous,

00:01:49.173 --> 00:01:51.030
and, as always with Ravensburger,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850
enter for a chance to win a copy of the game

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.880
by heading over to Ravensburger NA-- sorry,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.470
@RavensburgerNA on Twitter,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.570
where they're giving away copies of the game right now.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.545
And remember Boomerang will always...

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:05.790
"see you around."

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.710
TRAVIS: Woof.
LAURA: Oh, wow.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.620
SAM: Boomerang!

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.140
TRAVIS: Did that boomerang have bullet holes in it?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.079
SAM: I don't know.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.320
(laughter)

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.550
I was supposed to bring my boomerang from home,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.080
but I didn't,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.977
and then Max had to make one.

00:02:19.977 --> 00:02:23.151
(laughter)

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:25.800
He made it out of cardboard for Boomerang!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.550
I think he used a piece of cardboard

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.939
that had been used to do painting on before.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.678
TRAVIS: That looked super street tough.

00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:34.511
LAURA: Yeah.

00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:36.040
TRAVIS: It leant it cred.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.350
MATT: Yeah.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.825
LIAM: And hang onto that costume, though,

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.120
cause we'll use it later.
SAM: Boomerang!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.570
MATT: I'm not going to lie, it is
making me miss the Tick show, though.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.095
MARISHA: Oh yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:47.097
MARISHA: Just shouting your name,

00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:49.572
is your catchphrase?

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:52.222
MATT: The special--
SAM: Thanos, Boomerang!

00:02:54.487 --> 00:02:58.650
MATT: Special power to just induce
endless cringe on their enemies.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.191
Avengers are like, "Oh!

00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.867
"(inhales sharply) Mm!"

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:04.998
LAURA: "I feel guilty fighting him.
He's just so pathetic."

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:06.322
MATT: All right. Thank you, Sam.

00:03:06.322 --> 00:03:08.930
And thank you, Ravensburger. (laughing)

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.020
Our second sponsor tonight,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.203
our friends since beginning of campaign two, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:14.685
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:17.585
MATT: So you can become a D&amp;D Beyond
subscriber if you'd like to.

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:20.652
You can unlock new features and get
most out of your D&amp;D Beyond account

00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:23.683
through this, without having to purchase
everything at one big go.

00:03:23.683 --> 00:03:26.490
You get early to access to tools and the features,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.654
like the combat tracker,

00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:29.760
and create unlimited characters on your account,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.977
which is useful, because I have a bunch on there

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:34.340
that I never get to play, because I'm the DM.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.610
Plus you can share access of all your unlocked content

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.090
with your party, who are part of your
campaigns on there as well,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.923
which is awesome.

As for our announcements.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.563
Reminding you guys

00:03:54.563 --> 00:03:56.786
<i>The World of Critical Role</i> book is now available.

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:57.840
(cheering)

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.980
MATT: It's now ready for purchase.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.210
It is a behind the scenes nonfiction guide

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.010
to all of this insanity that we've been stumbling through

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.410
over the years with you all.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.530
It's written by the amazing Liz Marsham,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.150
and interviews from all of us are scattered throughout,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.860
from the beginning experiences

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.480
all the way up to current day.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.849
There's a bunch of great pictures

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.820
and odd elements of our history,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.770
even our home game, as well as behind the scenes looks

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.500
that you don't see anywhere else.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.170
It includes introduction by Felicia Day,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.520
friend of the show and friend of ours.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.650
It features brand new illustrations by Oliver Barrett,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.047
and photography by Ray Kachatorian.

00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:36.680
And the audio book is read

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.523
by our very own Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:40.410
(cheering)

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.650
MATT: And the foreword of the book
is read by Felicia Day herself,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.154
wrote it, so, fantastic.

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:48.064
So if you were in the U.S., Canada, or the U.K.,
you can pick up your copy right now,

00:04:48.064 --> 00:04:50.039
wherever books are sold,
including Amazon, Barnes and Noble,

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.000
or at your local independent bookstore.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.060
The book is also available in a hard cover, like this,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.750
as well as eBook, audio book formats,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.444
and actually there-- I got to show
a couple more things in here.

00:05:00.444 --> 00:05:02.126
TRAVIS: You get to show more?
MATT: Yeah.

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:03.935
Here's--
LAURA: Oh cool, yes!

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:05.545
MATT: Interior collection.

00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:08.635
TRAVIS: Tilt it down, aw yeah.
MARISHA: Aww!

00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:09.921
MATT: This is the inner page there,

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:12.263
a bunch of names, maybe you'll find yourself in there.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.640
We also have some awesome interior art.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.210
SAM: Ooh, cool.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.979
MATT: Character moments there.

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:20.812
MARISHA: Get it.

00:05:20.812 --> 00:05:22.420
LIAM: It'll put you right back in the campaign.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.400
MATT: And here's a moment that some people

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.800
are familiar with this campaign will recognize.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.333
LIAM: Oh yeah, hello.
TRAVIS: Just a little bit.

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:30.760
ASHLEY: Put your fate in your hands--
LAURA: Roll the dice!

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.360
MATT: I'm going to randomly pick a page here,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.760
because I can.
SAM: You can?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.426
MATT: Oh yeah, this is cool--
LAURA: You can pick any page?

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:38.517
TRAVIS: He can do whatever he wants.
MATT: I can do whatever I want, it's out.

00:05:38.517 --> 00:05:41.010
And they have some artistic reinterpretations

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.193
of some of the original maps
when we first started streaming.

00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:45.030
(cheering)
LIAM: That's our first battle, right?

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.585
MATT: The very first battle we streamed, out in Kraghammer.

00:05:47.585 --> 00:05:50.321
LAURA: That's awesome!
TRAVIS: The little baby.

00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.700
LAURA: Wait, was that the--
then the serpent thingy come out?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.366
MATT: Yeah, it was--
LIAM: The naga?

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:56.199
MATT: Yeah, the--
SAM: Don't say it,

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.590
they'll have to get the book to find out.
LAURA: Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.740
TRAVIS: Then you found that hidden door,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.320
and I knew we were in the wrong, we were outclassed.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.830
MATT: Yeah, that's okay, but for more information,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.810
check out criticalrolebooks.com.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.117
Laura, you got some things to talk about.

00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:10.750
LAURA: Oh, I do.

00:06:12.283 --> 00:06:14.626
I have to show you guys this,

00:06:14.626 --> 00:06:16.967
doo doo doo doo, I don't know if you can see it.

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:18.273
TRAVIS: There you go, look, it's great.

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:21.750
LAURA: Look at that, it's our very own Caduceus Clay,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.290
made by our buddies at Steamforged.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.170
(cheering)

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.530
Yeah-- oh, that's it.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.948
He goes with the rest of the Mighty Nein set,

00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:31.256
it was specifically made for that.
(laughter)

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:32.997
I got it right.

00:06:32.997 --> 00:06:36.731
And this is available along with the Mighty Nein entire set

00:06:36.731 --> 00:06:39.207
in the U.S. and the U.K. stores right now.

00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:40.040
SAM: Nice.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.857
TALIESIN: Caddy.
MATT: Brilliance.

00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:43.400
All right, I believe--

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.100
LAURA: It's really good, Tal;
I don't know if you've seen it.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.070
TALIESIN: I've got one right here.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.400
I'm just thinking maybe I should make some more minis.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.687
Sorry. (laughing)

00:06:51.687 --> 00:06:53.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know where you're going with that.

00:06:53.232 --> 00:06:55.180
LAURA: Don't you even.
TRAVIS: Molly comes creeping back,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.380
and all of a sudden he's a power.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.926
LIAM: Why is Caduceus throwing himself
off the side of the ship?

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:01.307
(laughter)

00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:03.004
TRAVIS: Yep.
TALIESIN: No, really.

00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:05.266

MATT: No.

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:06.722
LAURA: Are you going to--
MATT: No.

00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:08.740
LAURA: Please stay in that the entire episode.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.023
SAM: I will not stay in this!

00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:12.131
Boomerang!

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.940
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus!

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.270
MATT: On that note, our announcements are complete,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.750
so let's jump into

MATT: And welcome back.
(laughter)

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.834
MATT: So last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

00:09:04.834 --> 00:09:08.380
upon realizing that an old friend of theirs

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.690
seemed to be trudging his way northward

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.053
in a similar direction,

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.930
you gathered your materials,

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.440
you finished up your business as quickly as you could,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.440
hastened your plans underneath Lady Vess DeRogna

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.480
and made your journey to the northern tip

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.720
of the Greying Wildlands, to the
village of-- Palebank Village,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.000
acquired passage on the Midnight Hammer, an icebreaker ship,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.840
heading to Eiselcross and began to work your way

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.700
across the dangerous Frozen Depths

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.393
that lay between there and your target location.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.510
A few days at sea had been a little rough at first go.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.010
Some unlucky rolls and some unfortunate challenges

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.140
found their way your direction,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.050
including here on what I believe

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.823
is the fifth day of your journey.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.440
A massive crackling ice storm

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.083
began to blow its way into your path.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.840
As people on the ship began to batten down

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.680
and prepare for it,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.020
Caduceus, you picked up some sort of strange clicking sound

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.320
that seemed to be sourceless

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.880
from the outside of the boat.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.840
There, you watched as these massive

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.780
crustacean-like creatures began to claw

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.821
back onto the top of the ship,

00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:27.683
similar to creatures that you all have seen in the past.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.710
After having a brief skirmish with them,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.639
seemingly getting the better hand,

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:35.900
or the upper hand of this,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.900
a familiar humanoid creature

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.900
with a split jaw and somewhat aquatic appearance

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.490
clambered up the opposite side of the ship,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.950
reached out, and shattered the amber necklace

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:53.270
that Caleb keeps carefully on his person.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.490
In doing so, the contents of it

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.654
spilling out of its solidified dimensional space,

00:10:58.654 --> 00:11:01.370
including the cloven crystal,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.870
the last key to Uk'otoa's unleashing.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.150
In the middle of this chaos,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.490
Fjord, you glance over to notice

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.423
that rising over the edge of the ship is none other

00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:15.814
than Captain Avantika.

00:11:15.814 --> 00:11:17.700
Paler than you recall,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.620
her chest and torso currently encased in jagged ice,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.950
her breath giving off this mist.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.880
As she looks to you with cold, faintly, glowing eyes,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.368
and a wicked grin, her neck somewhat off kilter,

00:11:31.368 --> 00:11:33.326
and seems to be inviting this...

00:11:34.234 --> 00:11:35.475
reunion.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.370
And that's where we left off,

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.116
in the middle of this struggle and fight.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.192
LIAM: So excited.

00:11:41.192 --> 00:11:43.360
MATT: From the top of this--
LAURA: Hoo-kay!

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.056
MATT: -- combat round, we come to Beauregard.

00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:48.892
MARISHA: O-o-o-h.

00:11:48.892 --> 00:11:49.725
LAURA: Kick us off.

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:52.150
MATT: You had just found yourself charmed briefly,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.610
and then come back to, wiping the influence from your eyes.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.120
However, you are still grappled in the claws

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.940
of a charmed creature, who is now currently incapacitated

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.637
and just clutching you in this tightened grip.

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:03.325
TRAVIS: Totally strategized for this.

00:12:03.325 --> 00:12:07.667
MARISHA: Does disengage-- can I
disengage from grapple if I--

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:10.813
MATT: No, you have-- it's an action to break free,

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.290
and you have to roll versus its strength.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.600
It has disadvantage, though.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.233
I will say-- yeah.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.220
MARISHA: It has disadvantage on strength?

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.510
MATT: Because it's incapacitated at the moment,

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.730
I'll say, circumstantially, right now,
because it can't take actions.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.250
It's just currently standing there dazzled

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.800
by the hypnotic pattern that held it there.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.630
It's not as strong as it once was

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.600
in the moment, because it is distracted.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.303
MARISHA: Okay, okay, yeah, I'll try that.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.670
So, wait, it's contested strength roll?

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.345
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Saving throw, or--

00:12:41.345 --> 00:12:43.023
MATT: No, just a strength check.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.842
LIAM: Straight roll.
MARISHA: No.

00:12:45.842 --> 00:12:47.683
LIAM: In strength.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.419
LAURA: You can do it.

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:51.219
MARISHA: Aah!

00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:52.520
TALIESIN: Cocked.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.134
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: (laughs)

00:12:54.134 --> 00:12:55.400
MARISHA: Four.
SAM: Ooh.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.340
MATT: You are unable to break free from its grasp.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.090
As you try and pull your way out,

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.680
it's just too tightly wrapped around your torso.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.666
You feel the jagged edges of the claw

00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:08.250
grind into the flesh and hurt just a bit,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.060
You're not going to get out.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.180
SAM: So incapacitated doesn't mean

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.755
they let go of everything and--

00:13:13.755 --> 00:13:16.220
MATT: No, it depends on-- incapacitated technically means

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.730
they do not have actions or bonus actions,

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.060
they can't do anything, they're not asleep.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.430
They're just currently dazed by the spell.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.689
SAM: In whatever state they were in.
TALIESIN: That wasn't a save throw, was it?

00:13:25.689 --> 00:13:26.563
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: No.

00:13:26.563 --> 00:13:28.740
SAM: I'd like to think they do lose
control of their bowels, though.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.650
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Sure, yeah, we'll go with that.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.483
LIAM: Scat all over--

00:13:31.483 --> 00:13:33.638
MATT: A terrifying smell of crustacean shit

00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:36.180
now completely fills the side of the boat.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.230
LAURA: How do crustaceans poop?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.424
Is it like long strings like fish, or is it--

00:13:39.424 --> 00:13:41.600
LIAM: It's pretty liquid, it's pretty liquid, yeah.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.810
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.230
MATT: Yeah. ♪ The more you know! ♪

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.858
Beauregard, what you doing?

00:13:46.858 --> 00:13:48.430
MARISHA: I guess I'm stuck here,

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.240
I might as well punch it in the face.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.527
MATT: Well, you used your action to break through.

00:13:52.527 --> 00:13:55.168
MARISHA: (forlornly) But I can do
bonus action Flurry of Blows.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:58.001
MATT: You can't do Flurry of Blows,
because I believe you have to use your action

00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:00.634
as part of an attack action, but you can get--

00:14:00.634 --> 00:14:03.340
MARISHA: But I can do an extra attack?
Can I do an extra attack?

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.376
TRAVIS: Keep pushing with the lower lip.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.753
MATT: I'll allow it, go for it. You can make one attack.

00:14:08.753 --> 00:14:10.327
LIAM: (sadly) "I'm a monk of the Cobalt Soul."

00:14:10.327 --> 00:14:11.690
MARISHA: So does it have to be a standard attack,

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.179
or can I do--

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:15.754
can I do my--

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.220
TRAVIS: Thought for sure she'd get out of that.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.479
MARISHA: -- my Belabor?
MATT: That's an action, that's an action.

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:22.080
MARISHA: That's an action.
LIAM: She's as weak as a wizard.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.010
MATT: This-- believe it or not, there are some circumstances

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.670
where a monk can't do everything.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.563
SAM: Wow.

00:14:26.563 --> 00:14:29.580
MATT: They're rare. I found it!
LAURA: We found it!

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.750
MARISHA: So wait, are you saying I can just attack?

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.630
MATT: You get one punch.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.815
MARISHA: (sadly) I punch it.

00:14:33.815 --> 00:14:37.120
SAM: One punch, Beau.
MARISHA: One Punch Beau.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.610
SAM: Whoa, that was a weird roll.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.320
MARISHA: Yeah, it was, but it was a 17,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.220
so I take it for 27.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.410
MATT: 27 hits.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.362
SAM: Saddest hit ever.

00:14:47.362 --> 00:14:50.652
MARISHA: Cocked, I had such a-- aw, man.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.950
Seven.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.780
MATT: Seven points of damage.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.216
MARISHA: Stunning Strike!
MATT: Whack!

00:14:56.216 --> 00:14:57.954
All right.

00:14:57.954 --> 00:14:58.787
MARISHA: I can do that!

00:14:58.787 --> 00:15:00.430
SAM: She's happy again.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.270
MATT: That is 17?

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.570
TALIESIN: Take your d4.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.760
MARISHA: Damn it-- wait, what?
TALIESIN: Take your d4.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.240
MATT: Oh, minus d4, because it--

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.412
LAURA: Oh, he's baned, baby.
MATT: There you go, 15.

00:15:09.412 --> 00:15:10.730
MARISHA: Stunned!
MATT: Stunned.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.630
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Fucker.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.750
MATT: So.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.987
TALIESIN: Not you, it.
MATT: Stunned, fucker!

00:15:14.987 --> 00:15:16.211
(laughter)

00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:20.090
LAURA: Can I say, in that moment before he was stunned,

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.670
as she punched him did he move at all?

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.833
MATT: No.
LAURA: Damn it.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.780
MATT: So he's no longer charmed,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.680
as you punched the charm out of him, so--

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.590
(gurgly growling)

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.372
and now it's-- the impact,

00:15:34.372 --> 00:15:36.770
this delayed reaction as you slam it

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.890
right in the area where the metal plates hit,

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.950
or the hard crustacean plates hit,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.180
and it seems to have

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.180
sent a shock through his nervous system,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.640
and he's currently trying to recalibrate.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.810
MARISHA: Does that cancel his grapple?

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.833
MATT: No, he's still holding onto you.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.970
LIAM: It's just, the tendons are all locked up.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.003
MATT: Yeah, incapacitated.

00:15:57.003 --> 00:15:58.230
TALIESIN: It's okay.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.220
MATT: Can't take actions or reactions

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.960
is technically what it means.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.600
But you still have to break free.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.420
TRAVIS: Veth, where are you on the ship?

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.550
SAM: I'm towards the bow-- the stern.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.480
MATT: That finishes Beau's turn?
MARISHA: Yep.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.700
MATT: All right, Fjord, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.970
TRAVIS: Shit, fuck, balls, anus.
MARISHA: Didn't go as well-- sorry.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.803
TRAVIS: Okay. Uh...

00:16:16.803 --> 00:16:19.453
(gibberish, operatic singing)

00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:23.310
I will respond by seeing my ex-- dead ex

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.080
just pop up on the ship.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.067
She is on the ship!

00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:28.120
Is she on the railing,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.095
or did she hop over in both feet are on the deck?

00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:32.330
MATT: She's like up on the edge of the railing,

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.680
and attempted to try and chuck you off the side,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.440
and then when you resisted, she just stays there.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.570
Starts stepping over the edge

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.730
and is drawing both the rapier and the dagger
that she's holding out to the edges--

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.201
TRAVIS: God, I really just want to
Spartan and kick her off the boat.

00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:45.835
LAURA: Do it.

00:16:45.835 --> 00:16:46.960
MATT: If you want to.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.430
TRAVIS: That's an action, though.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.105
SAM: And if you miss you'll look real dumb.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:55.472
TRAVIS: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:58.490
♪ And my strength ain't the best ♪

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.215
LIAM: That sounds win-win to me. I'd go for it.

00:17:01.215 --> 00:17:03.850
SAM: This is Spart-- whoa!

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.370
LAURA: Don't you have the Eldritch Blast

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.371
that blasts people back or something?

00:17:08.371 --> 00:17:09.270
No?

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.378
TRAVIS: Nope, I didn't take that.

00:17:12.783 --> 00:17:14.010
With my bonus action,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.980
I'm going to cast a Hexblade's Curse at Avantika.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.956
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:17:18.956 --> 00:17:20.806
SAM: Hex.
TALIESIN: Nice.

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.223
LAURA: Aw, hex.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.276
SAM: -- blade's curse.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.280
MATT: We'll say she is currently cursed by you.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.270
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.970
I am going to move directly over the cloven crystal.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.333
I'll use my 30 feet to run to where it lies on the deck.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.760
MATT: Okay, you're going to run this way?

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.340
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
MATT: All right.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.195
She gets an attack of opportunity against you.

00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:49.461
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Which she will take...

00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:54.351
with her rapier.

00:17:56.047 --> 00:17:57.810
TALIESIN: Hangin' on the side of the boat.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.660
MATT: It's a 21 to hit.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.410
TRAVIS: Hits. Is there any bane on her?

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.243
There's not.
TALIESIN: No.

00:18:02.243 --> 00:18:04.335
MATT: Bane doesn't help the attack roll.

00:18:04.335 --> 00:18:05.363
TALIESIN: Actually--

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.380
MATT: It's saving--
TALIESIN: Not that she's baned.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.210
MATT: Right, I believe bane is saving throws.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.070
TALIESIN: And attack rolls.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.820
MATT: And attack rolls as well, you're right.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.840
TALIESIN: But she's not baned.
MATT: But she's not, you're right.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.230
TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry.
MATT: That's okay.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.460
However, that is...

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.520
16 points of piercing damage.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.640
TRAVIS: Hold on.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.114
I'm going to roll a d6,

00:18:24.114 --> 00:18:26.510
because she's been hexblade cursed.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.800
And with my Armor of Hexes,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.893
if I roll a four or higher,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.860
she misses.
MATT: Yes, she does.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.700
TRAVIS: Which she does, I got a five.
LAURA and MARISHA: Ooh!

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.643
MATT: So swings with the rapier

00:18:37.643 --> 00:18:41.320
and the dark shadows

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.240
that currently swirl around her torso

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.530
reach out and grab her arm

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.050
and pull it just wide out of the way,

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.508
and it swings past your body as you rush over.

00:18:48.508 --> 00:18:49.580
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.980
LAURA: That's titties.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.390
TRAVIS: Standing over the cloven crystal,

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.427
with it between my feet, I'm going to use my--

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:58.313
LAURA: Just sit down.

00:18:58.313 --> 00:18:59.588
TRAVIS: I'm going to put it in my butt.

00:18:59.588 --> 00:19:00.624
(laughter)

00:19:00.624 --> 00:19:03.190
Get back in me, cloven crystal!

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.040
MATT: What you doing?

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.750
TRAVIS: One flap, a trap, or in the other.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.532
I am going to--
LIAM: Old habits die hard.

00:19:08.532 --> 00:19:13.532
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my action
to use my channel divinity.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.713
I'm going to Create Marine Layer.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.513
MATT: Okay.

00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:19.840
TRAVIS: I'm going to channel the sea

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.610
to create a thick cloud of fog that surrounds you

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.700
and heavily obscures the area for 20 feet

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.920
in all directions, follows me as I move.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.172
You and any other creatures you
choose within five feet of you

00:19:30.172 --> 00:19:33.031
can see through the fog and suffer
no penalties from being within it.

00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:34.860
This fog lasts for 10 minutes,

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.690
spreads around corners and cannot be dispersed.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.842
SAM: Sorry, did you can just say

00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:40.372
that you and your allies can see through the fog?

00:19:40.372 --> 00:19:41.205
TRAVIS: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yep.

00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:43.643
MATT: If they're right next to him.
SAM: Ah.

00:19:43.643 --> 00:19:45.216
LAURA: Oh, so if we wander into it

00:19:45.216 --> 00:19:46.720
we won't be able to see it until we get next to Fjord?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.690
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Okay, okay.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.770
MATT: So all of you who are looking in that direction,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.003
you watch as Fjord rushes over,
down to where the crystal is,

00:19:53.003 --> 00:19:54.020
grabs the sword,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.420
and then suddenly apparating from around him,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.270
this heavy fog just fills the center of the ship,

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.600
and you have no idea--

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.135
You can't see across the ship,
you can't see where Fjord is.

00:20:04.135 --> 00:20:06.210
You just lost a visibility on half the ship.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.020
TRAVIS: I just go--
(foghorn)

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.160
MATT: There you go.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.602
That's his battle cry, whenever he uses that feature.

00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:13.712
TRAVIS: (high horn)

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.203
MATT: No, that's <i>my</i> battle cry.

00:20:15.203 --> 00:20:16.957
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.
MATT: Don't step.

00:20:16.957 --> 00:20:18.377
TRAVIS: That's the end of that.

00:20:18.377 --> 00:20:19.643
MATT: Okay, that's the end of Fjord's turn.

00:20:19.643 --> 00:20:20.960
Got it. Yasha, you're up.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.250
ASHLEY: Okay, so,

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.000
since I see that Beau is grappled,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.390
I'm going to try and cut off the

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.175
pincer from the lobstrosity.

00:20:33.175 --> 00:20:34.420
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: So, just going to turn

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.091
and try to start hacking away.
MARISHA: "Lobstrosity"!

00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:38.210
MATT: Start hacking at the one that's
currently holding on to Beauregard?

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.804
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to try to hack away at that arm.

00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:41.842
MATT: All right, so you got your two attacks on that.

00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:43.123
ASHLEY: So...

00:20:44.496 --> 00:20:46.150
17?
MATT: 17 hits.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.023
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

00:20:49.157 --> 00:20:51.040
Let me get some dice.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.473
SAM: Rock lobster.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.410
ASHLEY: I'm going to do Savage Attacker,

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.513
because that was kind of low.

00:21:03.838 --> 00:21:05.113
Much better.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.070
32.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.540
SAM: Whoa!
MATT: 32 points of damage.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.920
TRAVIS: Yo, let's go!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.905
MATT: All righty, first strike, as
you swing wide with a blade,

00:21:19.905 --> 00:21:22.120
carve through the heavy chunk of its body,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.340
you watch as part of the armor

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.120
that blocks the part of the face

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.623
is now carved in two,

00:21:26.623 --> 00:21:28.980
and this dark purple viscera

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.350
is now hanging out and bleeding

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.000
as its clicking sound has now become

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.060
this warbling--
(grunting)

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.590
it's in pain.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.860
ASHLEY: All right, let's see if we can do a little more.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.460
MARISHA: Are you rolling with advantage?

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.014
ASHLEY: No.
MARISHA: Stunned.

00:21:41.014 --> 00:21:43.130
ASHLEY: (grunts)
MATT: Yes.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.600
MATT: Yeah, okay, that would be a 23.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.429
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: That hits, second strike.

00:21:48.429 --> 00:21:49.262
ASHLEY: So...

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.680
25 for the second hit.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.866
MATT: 25 points of damage?
ASHLEY: 25 points of damage.

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:58.545
MATT: Nice!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:21:58.545 --> 00:22:00.573
TRAVIS: Well done, let's go.

00:22:02.658 --> 00:22:04.309
MATT: So, two times through,

00:22:04.309 --> 00:22:06.420
this creature's looking pretty dang hurt.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.690
It's still currently standing upright,

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.360
though it is stunned from your strike.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.735
It's not long for this world if this were to continue,

00:22:13.735 --> 00:22:16.810
but it is still holding onto Beauregard best it can.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.620
ASHLEY: Okay, so then as my bonus action,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.710
I would like to use Zealous Presence

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.900
and let out a battle cry.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.950
MATT: Okay.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.480
ASHLEY: Which gives 10 other creatures in 60 feet

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.562
advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

00:22:32.562 --> 00:22:33.502
SAM: Ooh.
TRAVIS: Ooh shit!

00:22:33.502 --> 00:22:34.569
MATT: Okay.

00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:36.319
TRAVIS: What?
SAM: Wait, what?

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.490
ASHLEY: Attacks and saving throws?
MARISHA: Attacks and saving throws.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.307
LIAM: Name this feature again--
ASHLEY: 'Til my next turn.

00:22:41.307 --> 00:22:43.647
LIAM: -- so we can fall in love with it.
MATT: Everybody except for Jester.

00:22:43.647 --> 00:22:45.755
MATT: Jester, you're just outside her range.
ASHLEY: Zealous Presence.

00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:47.607
MARISHA: She's done it once or twice before.

00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:50.150
LAURA: Oh no, it's okay, it's my fault,

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.033
I should've been closer to you.

00:22:52.033 --> 00:22:52.866
ASHLEY: No, no, no.

00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:54.250
Wait, no, aren't you up on the--

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.960
LAURA: My duplicate is next to you.
MATT: Duplicate's next to you.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.071
LAURA: My duplicate feels really invigorated.

00:22:59.071 --> 00:23:00.414
MATT: That's true, that's true.
ASHLEY: 60 feet.

00:23:00.414 --> 00:23:01.600
TRAVIS: That's huge.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.080
SAM: Who else is within 60 feet?

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.210
TRAVIS: Everybody except Jester.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.193
SAM: Me, too?
TRAVIS: Yup.

00:23:05.193 --> 00:23:07.330
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Cool.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.444
TRAVIS: That's huge.
TALIESIN: That's magical.

00:23:09.444 --> 00:23:11.925
ASHLEY: I feel like I've used it before.
MATT: You've used it before, yeah.

00:23:11.925 --> 00:23:13.740
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.660
MATT: So it's for one round, until Yasha's next turn.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.160
ASHLEY: Til my next turn, so.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.411
MATT: All right, so that finishes your go Yasha?

00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:20.652
ASHLEY: That finishes my go.

00:23:20.652 --> 00:23:22.050
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Everybody, punch somebody.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:22.883
MATT: You got it.

00:23:22.883 --> 00:23:23.716
TRAVIS: Even the wizard.

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:24.853
MATT: It is now Avantika's turn.

00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:27.198
TRAVIS: After Yasha?

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:28.700
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.070
LAURA: Oh, she goes with the creatures?

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.132
MATT: Well she's going before them, actually.

00:23:33.132 --> 00:23:34.940
TRAVIS and LAURA: Okay.
MATT: In her initiative order.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.963
So after watching Fjord rush off,

00:23:38.347 --> 00:23:40.230
she watches the fog emerge

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.513
and cocks her head a little bit.

00:23:42.513 --> 00:23:43.829
"Very interesting."

00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:47.173
And is going to dart into the fog,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.163
is going to rush past you,

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.850
and is going to make an investigation
check with disadvantage

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.142
because of the fog that's in this space.

00:24:00.142 --> 00:24:02.551
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Did you pick it up or did you just--

00:24:02.551 --> 00:24:03.384
TRAVIS: No, I just--

00:24:03.384 --> 00:24:05.484
SAM: You fogged it.
TRAVIS: -- stood over it, yeah.

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.038
LIAM: Six things--

00:24:09.038 --> 00:24:10.893
MATT: She actually rolled pretty well, okay.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.010
Oh, and you can see this.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.430
She passes by you

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.900
and vaguely sees your shadow,

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.130
even though you're heavily obscured at that point,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.106
and she just darts to the ground

00:24:23.106 --> 00:24:24.800
and starts rummaging through

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.510
the elements of loose fireworks.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.890
But since the ball rolled this far,

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.480
it's almost solitary there on the center of the ground,

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.100
and it gives off its own faint, soft yellow glow,

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.190
almost in the proximity of Avantika.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.556
And she reaches down and grabs it with one hand,

00:24:39.556 --> 00:24:41.440
putting the dagger away.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.490
And with the rapier in her other hand, she stands up--

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.430
No, that's all of her movement.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.104
LAURA: (squeals)

00:24:50.104 --> 00:24:52.011
MATT: But she currently has the crystal

00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.607
in her possession and learns--

00:24:54.607 --> 00:24:55.873
SAM: She's in fog, so we did not see her pick it up.

00:24:55.873 --> 00:24:57.690
LIAM: So everyone outside the fog can't see her,

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.750
only Fjord sees her.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.070
MATT: All you saw was her vanish into the fog after Fjord.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.696
LIAM: Caduceus sees her, though, yeah?

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:04.820
MATT: No, Caduceus can't see anything.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.738
Caduceus, right now, suddenly, you have no visibility.

00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:08.270
You are lost in fog

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.000
and everything around you just went fucking--

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.157
TALIESIN: The last thing I saw was Fjord do a thing.

00:25:12.157 --> 00:25:13.210
MATT: Yeah.

00:25:14.852 --> 00:25:17.290
It's a problem. It doesn't feel oppressive.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.230
It just feels problem.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.480
LIAM: And I have a question, DM.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.905
Everyone on this side of the ship, once this fog's up,

00:25:23.905 --> 00:25:26.504
wouldn't have been able to see her

00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:27.890
enter into it either, right?

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:28.723
Like isn't it--
MATT: Correct,

00:25:28.723 --> 00:25:30.415
everyone on this side has no idea

00:25:30.415 --> 00:25:32.910
what's transpired at this point.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.270
Only probably Yasha and Beau would have any idea--

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.147
MARISHA: Where she went.

00:25:37.147 --> 00:25:38.862
MATT: But you guys are also a little distracted.

00:25:38.862 --> 00:25:41.830
At most you would have just seen her
just dart into the fog and that's it.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.663
LAURA: I have a question.

00:25:42.663 --> 00:25:45.590
Can I see above the fog since I was up on the stairs?

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.515
MATT: The fog is 20 feet in a full radius.

00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:50.348
LAURA: Okay.

00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:52.833
MATT: So no, you cannot see the other side of the ship.

00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:55.500
That finishes Avantika's turn.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.420
Crawling up onto this side of the ship, of her,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.880
you see this weird almost toad-like demon creature--

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.627
LAURA: Jesus.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.610
MATT: It has this faint pulsing glow to it,

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.409
like it has runes on its chest.

00:26:10.409 --> 00:26:13.400
Some sort of-- you can make an arcana check.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.475
LIAM: Hell yeah.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.490
That's high, that is...

00:26:19.864 --> 00:26:21.188
26.

00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:22.740
MATT: 26.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.933
MATT: You acknowledge this here as a--

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.430
you acknowledge this as--

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.930
usually the effects that are given off

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.260
by a creature that has been summoned.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.370
It is being held here for a time by some sort of magic.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.390
LIAM: Okay.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.850
MATT: But it comes into the side here

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.530
and darts over to you.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.350
Right as you recognize this,

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.650
it goes in your direction

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.415
with these large extended claws
out on both sides of its hands.

00:26:49.415 --> 00:26:52.262
It's going to come over to you for one strike here.

00:26:52.262 --> 00:26:54.420
TRAVIS: Fuck.
LAURA: Oh my God.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.414
MATT: That is a 22 to hit.

00:26:57.414 --> 00:27:00.338
LIAM: Yeah, hits. Hits.
MATT: Hits, all right.

00:27:01.178 --> 00:27:02.778
You take...

00:27:02.778 --> 00:27:04.511
11 points of slashing damage.

00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:08.144
It's going to attack again.

00:27:08.144 --> 00:27:09.977
22 again.
LIAM: Yeah, hits.

00:27:11.838 --> 00:27:15.098
MATT: Shitty rolls. 10 points of slashing damage.

00:27:15.098 --> 00:27:18.243
And then one more time, it's going to--

00:27:18.243 --> 00:27:19.724
that's cocked, actually.

00:27:19.724 --> 00:27:22.360
TRAVIS: And you've got your stone, right?

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.860
MATT: That's 17 points, 17 to hit.

00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:27.989
LIAM: Hits.

00:27:27.989 --> 00:27:29.710
MATT: Hits, okay.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:30.901
You then take...

00:27:32.835 --> 00:27:34.226
okay, there it is--

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.753
okay, 15 points of slashing damage.

00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:42.833
And then after it's like--
(hissing)

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.390
It vanishes.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.540
SAM and LIAM: Oh--
MARISHA: What?

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.200
SAM: It's like a blink monster?

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.820
MATT: It's going to appear

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.185
right behind Jester on the staircase.

00:27:53.185 --> 00:27:54.330
LAURA: Mother--

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.190
MATT: And you feel these feet hit the wood behind you

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.521
as you glance over,

00:27:58.521 --> 00:28:00.480
and the thing that you just saw assault Caleb

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.530
is now behind you--
(grunting)

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:03.750
its tongue dangling out

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.044
over this jagged row of teeth on the bottom jaw.

00:28:06.044 --> 00:28:07.538
SAM: I'm staring to think those lobsters

00:28:07.538 --> 00:28:09.536
were not our biggest foe.

00:28:09.536 --> 00:28:11.780
(laughter)

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.331
MATT: That finishes its go.
MARISHA: Just a pain in the ass.

00:28:14.331 --> 00:28:15.248
MATT: And then--

00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:18.800
SAM: Oh no, more things.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.633
TALIESIN: Jesus.

00:28:19.633 --> 00:28:21.680
MATT: Another one of these crustacean creatures

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.632
crawls up on the opposite end.

00:28:23.632 --> 00:28:25.561
LIAM: That's why he didn't want
to go long the other-- last game.

00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:26.861
SAM: Oh boy.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.195
MATT: Jumps down the center of the ship.

00:28:30.195 --> 00:28:31.765
MARISHA: It's really big!

00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:34.689
Wait, is it bigger, or is it
just the angle of the camera?

00:28:34.689 --> 00:28:37.571
MATT: The angle looks bigger. It's the same as the others.

00:28:37.571 --> 00:28:39.730
LAURA: Oh my God, you're huge!

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.755
MATT: Does it have Kosher salt all over it?

00:28:41.755 --> 00:28:44.147
(laughter)

00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:47.540
MATT: I like to make sure my minis are properly treated.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.007
MARISHA: When a spider crawls in front of your Nest cam.

00:28:50.007 --> 00:28:51.965
You're like-- (yelling)

00:28:51.965 --> 00:28:55.153
It's this big.
(chuckling)

00:28:55.153 --> 00:28:56.568
MATT: It's going to make--

00:28:56.568 --> 00:29:00.007
SAM: That would be sea salt. That makes much more sense.

00:29:00.007 --> 00:29:02.257
ASHLEY: Yeah, that looks massive.
MARISHA: It looks huge.

00:29:03.668 --> 00:29:05.360
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.090
MATT: Oh, because I forgot Yasha,

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.070
make a constitution saving throw for me, please.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.033
ASHLEY: Ooh, okay.

00:29:11.033 --> 00:29:12.193
SAM: Veth is like,

00:29:12.193 --> 00:29:14.205
"Hi, it's right behind me, isn't it?"

00:29:14.205 --> 00:29:15.487
(laughter)

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:16.779
"It's right behind me."

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.880
MARISHA: You can feel the breath.
SAM: Yeah, oh god.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.075
ASHLEY: 17? Oh wait, I can roll again.

00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:24.613
MATT: You're fine.
ASHLEY: It doesn't matter, okay.

00:29:24.613 --> 00:29:26.896
MATT: Something I forgot last time,
since we were at the end of the game,

00:29:26.896 --> 00:29:29.940
but the narrative is maintained.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.773
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:29:30.773 --> 00:29:33.882
MATT: Veth, you hear the-- (crash)
and as you look over your shoulder,

00:29:33.882 --> 00:29:35.900
you see the creature right there bearing down on you,

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.828
and it begins swiping at you both with its pincers.

00:29:37.828 --> 00:29:38.746
SAM: Yikes.

00:29:38.746 --> 00:29:40.090
MATT: The first one is...

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.598
19 to hit.
SAM: Hits.

00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:45.360
MATT: All right.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.810
You take--

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.535
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.
TRAVIS: I had two ideas.

00:29:48.535 --> 00:29:49.800
That was the wrong one.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.990
MATT: 15 points of bludgeoning damage,

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.861
and you are grappled.

00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:56.053
SAM: I'll Uncanny Dodge, I guess,

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.700
to reduce it to seven, eight points?

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.620
MATT: Okay.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.570
SAM: Eight points? Eight points.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.451
MATT: And it's going to use its
tentacles for its second attack.

00:30:09.554 --> 00:30:10.700
Well, actually it can do both,

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.667
because you are grappled by it now.

00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:15.340
The second strike has come at you.
That is going to be in 23 to hit.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.830
SAM: Sure.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.200
MATT: That one deals-- ooh!

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.770
16 points of bludgeoning damage.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.800
SAM: Sure.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.860
MATT: And what you notice,
as it grabs you with the claw,

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.910
and you're currently grappled in its grip

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.313
by it,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.260
you're pulled in, and underneath its armor,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.316
you watch as dozens of these tiny little tentacles

00:30:35.316 --> 00:30:36.697
(growling)
unroll out

00:30:36.697 --> 00:30:41.697
and begin to wrap and stick to you like tiny little leeches.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.460
And as it does, it begins to pump poison into your body.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.330
Make a constitution saving throw for me, please.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.080
SAM: My constitution is not very high.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.660
17.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.158
MATT: 17, you manage to resist the poison. You are fine.

00:30:55.158 --> 00:30:56.383
LIAM: Hey, DM?
MATT: Yes?

00:30:56.383 --> 00:30:58.800
LIAM: You and I both forgot, even though
I called it out at the top of the game,

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.842
I have Mirror Image up.

00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:02.770
So I have to roll three times for each of those attacks

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:03.974
to see if they hit.
MATT: That's true.

00:31:03.974 --> 00:31:07.573
LIAM: And if it's six or higher-- the first one,

00:31:08.475 --> 00:31:12.300
first one's a natural 20, so it hits a dupe.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.770
MATT: Okay, so that's one dupe down.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.880
LIAM: Second one is a four, so it hits me.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.450
MATT: Okay, so the first hit did not go through.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.682
LIAM: Right, second one did.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:31:20.682 --> 00:31:23.850
LIAM: And the third one,

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.880
it must be an eight or higher, it was a nine.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.853
MATT: All right, so only the middle attack--
LIAM: The middle attack hit.

00:31:28.853 --> 00:31:31.444
MATT: So mark off your damage on the
first and third, which I did not recall.

00:31:31.444 --> 00:31:32.620
LIAM: Right.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.620
I'll put two thirds back.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.820
MATT: Sure, we'll go with that.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.445
LIAM: Yep.
MATT: But you have one duplicate left.

00:31:37.445 --> 00:31:38.671
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
MATT: You got it.

00:31:38.671 --> 00:31:40.730
All right, that finishes their turn.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.300
Veth, you're up. Caleb you're on deck.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.420
SAM: I am grappled?

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.440
MATT: You are grappled currently.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.117
SAM: Does that mean I cannot complete--

00:31:48.117 --> 00:31:49.688
MATT: You can't move, but you can--

00:31:49.688 --> 00:31:52.490
SAM: -- the somatic portions of a spell or the--

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.470
what's the VSM?

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.650
I always fucking forget.
MATT: No, you can, you can.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.783
All that grappled means is your speed is zero

00:31:56.783 --> 00:31:58.799
until you break out of the grapple.

00:31:58.799 --> 00:31:59.774
MARISHA: But you can still do actions.

00:31:59.774 --> 00:32:01.410
MATT: You can still do spells and actions and attacks and stuff.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.390
SAM: Oh, so I can shoot,

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.551
I can shoot this fucker if I wanted to.

00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:05.800
MATT: Correct.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.200
SAM: I don't want to.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.793
Even though I'm grappled,

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.036
I'm going to hold my action until I see Avantika.

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.003
MATT: Okay.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.673
SAM: I think I will hold Phantasmal Force.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:25.563
MATT: Okay.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.720
You got it, all right.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.930
So you will hold onto that, cool.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.510
That brings us to Caleb. Jester, you're on deck.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.800
LIAM: Okay, I've never done this before,

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.640
but as part of my movement

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.480
I'm going to use the Stormrider Boots,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.110
and use 90 feet of movement

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:46.820
to fly on an angle curving around the lobster.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.920
I'm going to strafe the mage fishman up at the top

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.850
and then curve back.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.879
MATT: Back over here, you mean?

00:32:53.879 --> 00:32:56.650
LIAM: I'm going to go in a big curve,

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.390
so I want to zap the lobster and I want to zap the mage,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.740
but then double back around

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.040
and float over the top of the fog

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.160
by about like 30 or 40 feet.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.140
MATT: Okay, so you wanted to zoom up here

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.673
and buzz all three of them?

00:33:11.777 --> 00:33:12.610
LIAM: No.
MATT: Or this way?

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.200
You have 90 feet of movement, so you can go like--

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.649
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: And then this way, you mean?

00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:16.482
LIAM: That's right.

00:33:16.482 --> 00:33:17.850
So I'm going to get two of them, not three of them.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.625
Lobster man, dude at the top, and then float on top,

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:24.170
and then as my action, I'm going to cast Fly.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.160
MATT: Okay, good call.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.690
LIAM: 30 feet up--
MATT: But before we get to that,

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.230
there are two attacks opportunity on you.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.730
LIAM: That's right, at disadvantage.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.663
MATT: At disadvantage, exactly.

00:33:30.663 --> 00:33:32.790
LIAM: And they take damage regardless.
MATT: Yes, so roll damage for them.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.663
Just roll once and they'll both take it.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.310
MARISHA: Bonus action dash.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:42.090
LIAM: They take nine points of lightning damage each.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.980
MATT: Nice, so as you activate the boots,

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.470
there's this giant spark of energy

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.094
right beneath where your knees are.

00:33:47.094 --> 00:33:49.598
As you take off, like an Ironman suit,

00:33:49.598 --> 00:33:51.079
you watch as the blast back,

00:33:51.079 --> 00:33:52.420
shocks the crustacean.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.153
You spin around and arc off beyond

00:33:55.153 --> 00:33:58.353
the fishman mage up top,

00:33:58.353 --> 00:34:00.740
who gets hit and is going to try and swing for you, too.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.330
Crustacean, two strikes against you is...

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:05.900
14 to hit, which I think misses.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.733
LIAM: Misses.

00:34:06.733 --> 00:34:10.730
MATT: And the other guy

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.223
is going to swing with his sword.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.473
No, that's a 10.

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:22.440
Sorry, that's a 14. That still misses you.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.350
All right, and so you arc over and you cast Fly,

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.610
so you are now flying up in the air

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.590
over where this fog is, essentially.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.714
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:29.714 --> 00:34:33.083
MATT: We'll say up in this space.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.068
All righty, so you are now flying, you are concentrating.

00:34:38.068 --> 00:34:38.901
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:40.124 --> 00:34:40.957
MATT: Here ya go.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.393
Finishing Caleb's turn. Jester, you're up,
Caduceus, you're on deck.

00:34:46.464 --> 00:34:48.418
TRAVIS: Mage?

00:34:48.418 --> 00:34:49.912
MATT: No, Jester's up.

00:34:49.912 --> 00:34:52.100
TRAVIS: I thought the mage went after Caduceus.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.892
LAURA: Everything's messed up. Everything's messed up!

00:34:56.029 --> 00:34:58.054
(yells)

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.710
Everything's concentration that I have! I'm freaking out!

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.549
MATT: It's challenging.

00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:07.349
LAURA: (whispers) Okay.
LIAM: Spell casters.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.190
LAURA: Okay, I know right away for my bonus action,

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.660
I'm just going to use my Spiritual Weapon that I have up.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.493
ASHLEY: No.

00:35:16.493 --> 00:35:20.498
LAURA: And I'm going to hit the
stunned one that's holding Beau.

00:35:20.498 --> 00:35:22.490
MATT: Roll damage on that.
LAURA: Okay.

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.730
MATT: Well, roll attack on that and then damage.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.910
MARISHA: (quietly) Is that my husband?

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.730
With magic sequins?
SAM: Yeah.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.129
MARISHA: That's beautiful.
MATT: Ah, Jesus.

00:35:29.129 --> 00:35:31.454
(laughter)

00:35:31.454 --> 00:35:32.745
ASHLEY: Ah jeez.

00:35:32.745 --> 00:35:33.980
TALIESIN: Suddenly another crab--

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.440
SAM: It's hard to tell, but I think it's you as a doctor?

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.704
MATT: Yeah, that's one of my old shitty head shots.

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:41.433
People are like, "You need to make character head shots"

00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:45.215
and I'm like, "All right."
(laughter)

00:35:45.215 --> 00:35:46.599
LAURA: Okay, okay, roll an attack.

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:48.720
MARISHA: It was either that or a BTS shirt--
LAURA: With advantage.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.562
MARISHA: -- I couldn't tell from here.
MATT: Yes, because it is stunned.

00:35:51.562 --> 00:35:53.898
LIAM: Unstoppable, this bit.
LAURA: 19?

00:35:53.898 --> 00:35:55.775
MATT: 19, that definitely hits.
LAURA: Does that hit?

00:35:55.775 --> 00:35:57.150
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.290
2d8.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.123
I have all these dice,

00:36:00.123 --> 00:36:02.809
and I don't know which ones are which. I'm freaking out!

00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:04.150
(panicked grunting)

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.990
Where's my eight?

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.990
There they are, okay.

00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:10.567
LIAM: This is so cool.

00:36:10.567 --> 00:36:11.983
SAM: She's going to jump over the fucking edge.

00:36:11.983 --> 00:36:13.793
LAURA: Five, 13 plus five is 18--

00:36:13.793 --> 00:36:15.401
SAM: Of course, I don't know that.
LAURA: -- points of damage.

00:36:15.401 --> 00:36:16.360
MATT: How much is it?

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.733
LAURA: 18 points of damage with my serrated lollipop.

00:36:18.733 --> 00:36:20.699
LIAM: We had other ideas. I just threw them out.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.791
MATT: Great.
MARISHA: I feel responsible.

00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:25.358
TRAVIS: So do I.
MARISHA: For fucking up the--

00:36:25.358 --> 00:36:28.170
MATT: All right, that guy is hurt real bad.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.437
He's barely hanging on and is like-- (grunting)

00:36:31.437 --> 00:36:33.493
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Is this the stunned guy?

00:36:33.493 --> 00:36:36.258
MATT: Yes, but the other guy's no longer stunned.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.640
LAURA: Jester-- me, that's me,

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.687
for <i>my</i> thing, I'm going to do--

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.217
SAM: You're Jester?
LAURA: I'm Jester.

00:36:45.217 --> 00:36:46.090
(laughter)

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.813
LAURA: I'm going to cast...

00:36:47.813 --> 00:36:50.080
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: Yes?

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.258
You are going to cast...?

00:36:52.258 --> 00:36:54.963
LAURA: I don't know how to say it.

00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:56.620
Hold on, hold on.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.627
This is everybody. It doesn't save against my own people.

00:37:00.627 --> 00:37:01.870
I don't like that.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.840
Okay, so, am I surrounded?

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.673
Can I move?

00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:07.120
MATT: You are currently--

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.860
you have a giant crustacean to the right of you,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.310
you have this other weird demon creature to the back of you,

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.360
and you have Veth currently grappled to the front of you,

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.196
as well as one of the crewmen who is trying to arm

00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:22.572
and put a bolt up into one of these ballista,.

00:37:22.572 --> 00:37:23.960
and is just freaking out.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.990
Like, "Ah, ah!"

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.419
TRAVIS: We're running, it's bad.

00:37:29.419 --> 00:37:31.995
SAM: ♪ Stuck in the middle with you ♪
MARISHA: ♪ with y--♪ I--

00:37:31.995 --> 00:37:33.530
LAURA: I'm going to cast...

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.190
MATT: Yeah?

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.530
LAURA: I'm going to cast..

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:41.690
Insect Plague at fifth level.
MATT: Okay.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.590
TRAVIS: What about Wreck Undead Girlfriends?

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:48.406
LAURA: So that's a 20 foot sphere around me.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.860
MATT: Okay.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.230
LIAM: Maybe just mend those fences, Fjord.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.103
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, just patch it up.
(chuckling)

00:37:56.103 --> 00:37:57.675
Nothing a silver tongue can't cure.

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.320
LIAM: Right there, switch to persuasion.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.640
TRAVIS: "I've thought about your every day

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.920
since you got your head turned around 180 degrees."

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.898
MATT: All right.

00:38:05.898 --> 00:38:08.647
LAURA: Nope, no, I'm going to-- mm.

00:38:08.647 --> 00:38:10.381
(frantic humming)

00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:12.064
MATT: Laura?
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry,

00:38:12.064 --> 00:38:13.430
I'm sorry, Matthew!
MATT: It's okay, it's okay.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.688
It's okay, it's okay.
LAURA: I'm freaking out!

00:38:14.688 --> 00:38:16.280
Okay, I take it back, I take it back,

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.110
I'm going to cast Dawn instead.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.520
SAM: Dawn.
LAURA: Dawn.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.103
Which is basically the same thing,
but it's a different type of damage.

00:38:24.103 --> 00:38:25.730
So I'm going to cast Dawn,

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.060
which is a 30 foot radius,

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.320
40 foot high cylinder of bright light.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.170
MATT: That's even bigger.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:37.270
I don't have a template for that.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.740
LAURA: Each creature in it must
make a constitution saving throw.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.326
SAM: "Consti-tyew-tion."

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.690
MATT: 30 foot radius, so yeah, that'll be--

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.560
SAM: Each <i>enemy</i> creature, or each creature?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.273
MATT: Each creature.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.770
LAURA: Each creature, but I choose the location.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.461
MATT: Correct, where are you putting it,
within 60 feet of you?

00:38:55.461 --> 00:38:56.593
LIAM: It's a pretty crowded deck.

00:38:56.593 --> 00:38:58.730
LAURA: It is a pretty crowded deck.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.680
SAM: Deck of many things, really.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.210
LAURA: Is this a bad move, you guys?

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.360
TRAVIS: We're all back--
MATT: Just so you know,

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.788
you can only let it hit anything over here,

00:39:07.788 --> 00:39:10.277
because you have no visibility
to see across the ship right now.

00:39:10.277 --> 00:39:11.893
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: So where do you want it to land?

00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:13.739
TRAVIS: That's my fault, so.

00:39:13.739 --> 00:39:15.444
We're all in this together.
LAURA: In front of--

00:39:15.444 --> 00:39:17.615
MARISHA: You're having a Keyleth moment.
I'm so proud of you.

00:39:17.615 --> 00:39:19.953
SAM: (laughs)

00:39:19.953 --> 00:39:23.010
LAURA: In front of the--
MARISHA: Thanks, Fjord.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.713
LAURA: The door, in front of the door?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.670
(squeaking) Is it going to hit me?

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.040
MATT: Where are you casting, then?

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.203
(laughter)

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.803
LIAM: I cast haste on Laura.

00:39:33.803 --> 00:39:36.552
LAURA: No.
(laughter)

00:39:36.552 --> 00:39:38.694
(muffled) Okay, I changed my mind again!

00:39:38.694 --> 00:39:40.010
(laughing)
Spiritual Guardians,

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.591
and then I swear Matt, this is the last thing,
I'm going to do Spiritual Guardians.

00:39:42.591 --> 00:39:43.840
MATT: Spiritual Guardians, okay.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.543
LAURA: But I'm going to cast it at fifth level.

00:39:48.451 --> 00:39:49.284
MATT: Okay.

00:39:49.284 --> 00:39:51.545
SAM: So many different props.
MATT: I know.

00:39:51.545 --> 00:39:53.528
TRAVIS: Jester just scrolls through her spells, like--

00:39:53.528 --> 00:39:56.910
(scrolling sounds)

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.923
MATT: So 15 feet?

00:39:57.923 --> 00:39:59.364
MARISHA: No, shit, not that-- no!

00:39:59.364 --> 00:40:02.655
LAURA: Okay, so this is a 15 feet radius around me.

00:40:04.722 --> 00:40:07.140
I'm just trying to see how many circles you have.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.130
MATT: Apparently, we're going through it-- there we go.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.810
LAURA: Okay, so these only attack creatures that I choose?

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.643
MATT: Correct.

00:40:13.643 --> 00:40:15.020
LAURA: That are within 15 feet of me.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.807
SAM: But I'm going to choose everybody!

00:40:16.807 --> 00:40:20.700
LAURA: I'm going to choose every motherfucker on this boat!

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.020
Okay, so that is a 5d8 radiant damage.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.787
MATT: For those who fail their wisdom save, right?

00:40:26.787 --> 00:40:29.470
LAURA: It's a wisdom save, but it's a concentration,

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.800
which means I lose my duplicate.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.400
MATT: You do.
LAURA: On the other side.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.670
SAM: Also Matt, I think as soon as
I started to hold a spell,

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.580
do I lose concentration on the other spell?

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.413
MATT: You do, yes.

00:40:39.413 --> 00:40:43.730
SAM: So they're no longer encumbered, the lobster people.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.154
MATT: Oh, that's right, they're no longer charmed.
SAM: Charmed.

00:40:46.154 --> 00:40:47.115
LAURA: Oh.

00:40:48.563 --> 00:40:51.247
MATT: They are still baned,

00:40:51.247 --> 00:40:54.247
but they're no longer charmed, okay.

00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:58.355
You got it.

00:40:58.355 --> 00:40:59.420
So--

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.350
LAURA: Affected creatures are halved in the area.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.440
MATT: Right, their speed is halved.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.950
LAURA: And when they start their turn there,

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.722
they have to make a save.

00:41:06.722 --> 00:41:08.772
MATT: Gotcha.
TALIESIN: Or when they end it.

00:41:08.772 --> 00:41:10.309
LAURA: Yes.

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:12.390
TALIESIN: Which technically, when you cast it,
is that entering the area?

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.210
MATT: No, entering is when they're actually

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.933
stepping into the space,
or at the start of their turn.

00:41:15.933 --> 00:41:16.766
TALIESIN: Start of their turn.

00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:18.551
MATT: Pardon me, all right, does that finish your turn?

00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:21.210
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Okay, finishes Jester's go.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.050
Caduceus, you're up.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.465
TALIESIN: It was a good plan.
MATT: It was.

00:41:23.465 --> 00:41:25.887
TALIESIN: Laura, that was a good move,
we're going to celebrate it.

00:41:25.887 --> 00:41:27.617
TRAVIS: We're shitting our pants right now.

00:41:27.617 --> 00:41:29.710
Everybody's shitting.
MARISHA: Plan's out the window.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.460
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast
Spiritual Guardian at fourth level.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.470
MATT: Okay.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.620
TALIESIN: That was what I was--
TRAVIS: How many circles you got, Matt?

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.660
TALIESIN: Got another circle?
TRAVIS: How many you got?

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.493
MATT: Yeah.

00:41:40.493 --> 00:41:43.058
SAM: Thing's going to look like the fucking Olympics soon.

00:41:43.058 --> 00:41:46.025
MATT: All right, Caduceus--
LIAM: We all thought this was a randomly--

00:41:46.025 --> 00:41:48.838
TALIESIN: That also means Bane is gone.
TRAVIS: (singing Olympics theme)

00:41:48.838 --> 00:41:52.090
TALIESIN: And I'm going to walk towards where I saw Fjord,

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.240
because my whole plan was to give
him some coverage with a big--

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.560
LAURA: Caduceus, yours looks like it's glowing.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.393
TALIESIN: It is.

00:41:58.393 --> 00:42:00.270
SAM: Remember when the Olympics existed?

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.275
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM and TALIESIN: Nope.

00:42:03.486 --> 00:42:05.700
TALIESIN: So I was going to walk, not even run,

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.530
I was just going to take my gentle time

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.520
making my way to where I thought Fjord was--

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.186
MATT: To where you think Fjord is?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:42:11.186 --> 00:42:13.660
LAURA: ♪ Makin' my way to Fjord ♪
MARISHA: Old concept.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.126
LAURA: ♪ Walkin' slow ♪
MARISHA: Or yeah yeah yeah, old magic.

00:42:16.126 --> 00:42:17.718
ASHLEY: ♪ Makin' my way to Fjord ♪

00:42:17.718 --> 00:42:18.990
MATT: So you walk up into this space there,

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.800
and now you can see Fjord and you can see Avantika.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.983
TALIESIN: Hey! Oh, God.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.740
LAURA: And they both see lots of beetles.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.573
MATT: Yes.

00:42:27.573 --> 00:42:29.570
Now, within the fog, there's just,

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.880
just this swirling cloud of celestial beetles

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.426
that are just gathering around Caduceus.

00:42:35.426 --> 00:42:37.040
MARISHA: Wait, what do the beetles mean?

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.705
What happens if we walk into the beetles?

00:42:38.705 --> 00:42:39.950
TALIESIN: Nothing, you're fine.

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.065
LIAM: We thought this was a randomly rolled--

00:42:41.065 --> 00:42:43.070
LAURA: It's only enemies that get hurt by the beetles

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.407
and by the dick unicorns.

00:42:44.407 --> 00:42:46.700
LIAM: Thought this was off a table,
one of you are just like,

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.417
"Wait, he rolled a two so that means I've got this"--

00:42:49.417 --> 00:42:51.868
MATT: There was a one-in-10 chance
this encounter was going to happen.

00:42:51.868 --> 00:42:52.928
LIAM: One in 10?!

00:42:52.928 --> 00:42:55.048
LAURA: You rolled the one!

00:42:55.048 --> 00:42:56.756
TALIESIN: Oh wow.
ASHLEY: Tuh-ravis!

00:42:56.756 --> 00:42:57.789
LIAM: Woo!

00:42:57.789 --> 00:43:00.490
SAM: He knew. Travis knew, he wanted this.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.911
TRAVIS: Deep down, yeah.
(laughter)

00:43:03.911 --> 00:43:05.710
MATT: Okay, so, Caduceus, you've used your action,

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.850
you moved in there, you bump into Fjord,

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.125
and Fjord, you can see, all of a sudden,
the beetles are scattering in the space.

00:43:10.125 --> 00:43:12.250
They're not hurting you,
and right as Avantika stands up,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:16.142
the crystal in one hand, beginning
to tuck it into her side pouch.

00:43:16.142 --> 00:43:18.242
Caduceus approaches, too,
and the beetles swarm around her.

00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:21.767
She's like (growls) looking around,
eyes glowing through the fog a little bit.

00:43:21.767 --> 00:43:23.267
MARISHA: So you have eyes on her.

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:24.100
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.498
MATT: You do now.
TALIESIN: I do now, oh boy.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.383
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn?

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.504
TALIESIN: Yeah, I mean, yeah.
MATT: All right, that crew guy over there,

00:43:34.504 --> 00:43:37.641
who's currently trying to arm that ballista

00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:39.649
can't see what he's doing now,
because the fog has filled the space,

00:43:39.649 --> 00:43:42.356
so he's going to take another turn
to try and fiddle with it.

00:43:42.356 --> 00:43:44.120
This guy over here, who's been freaking out,

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.728
is going to finish loading the ballista with a heavy bolt,

00:43:47.728 --> 00:43:50.185
but that's his action to do so.

00:43:50.185 --> 00:43:53.463
That finishes the crew's go. Now it comes to the other mage.

00:43:54.368 --> 00:43:55.450
SAM: The other mage?

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.530
LIAM: Yeah, the guy on the back--
TRAVIS: The guy on the captain's wheel.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.930
SAM: Oh God, I totally forgot about them.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.546
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is rough.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:06.964 --> 00:44:08.128
SAM: I hate the water.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.960
TALIESIN: Everyone has an advantage on
a saving throw by the way.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.873
I should keep reminding people of that.

00:44:13.873 --> 00:44:16.390
LAURA: Everybody?
TALIESIN: Except for you.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:19.130
MARISHA: Because of Yasha's battle cry, and attacks--

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.910
TALIESIN: Attacks and saves.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:22.500
SAM: Attacks and saves.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.607
LAURA: That's important.

00:44:27.413 --> 00:44:29.180
MARISHA: Where's the mage?

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.722
LIAM: On the back.
LAURA: Up by the-- it's by the wheel.

00:44:31.722 --> 00:44:32.700
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay okay okay.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.491
SAM: Say "mage" again?

00:44:34.491 --> 00:44:36.066
MARISHA: (with soft "g" sound) <i>Mayzhe</i>?

00:44:38.438 --> 00:44:42.910
MATT: Similar type of physicality,
but a different individual.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:44.280
LIAM: This guy has a mustache.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.405

00:44:45.405 --> 00:44:46.892
MATT: Big, old--
MARISHA: <i>Mayzhe</i>, <i>mayzhe</i>?

00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:48.525
SAM: <i>Mayzhe</i>.

00:44:48.525 --> 00:44:50.117
MARISHA: A <i>may-jois</i>!

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.713
MATT: He is going to go ahead and--

00:44:52.713 --> 00:44:55.170
SAM: It's very European.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.441
I'm cultured.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.542
SAM: I would like to <i>rayzhe</i>.

TRAVIS: One in 10.

MATT: I know, I know.
TRAVIS: ♪ One in 10 ♪

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.646
A monkey wrench. Where's Chris Lockey when you need him?

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.144
MATT: My apologies here, as I'm figuring out--

00:45:19.144 --> 00:45:21.478
TRAVIS: No, our apologies, why are you apologizing?

00:45:21.478 --> 00:45:22.790
LAURA: Are you kidding me, Matt?

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.950
I took 20 minutes on my turn.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.030
SAM: Your <i>turns</i>. You did four of them.

LAURA: Why are you British, Ronin?

00:45:37.802 --> 00:45:39.273
ASHLEY: We should give Matt the heat.

00:45:39.273 --> 00:45:41.018
What are you doing, Matt?

00:45:41.018 --> 00:45:42.035
I'm just kidding.

00:45:42.035 --> 00:45:43.628
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: That'll work well.

00:45:43.628 --> 00:45:46.240
It's going to cast Witch Bolt at you,

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.830
because everyone else is currently surrounded and clustered,

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.617
and you just ran up

00:45:50.617 --> 00:45:54.360
and you're floating in the middle of
the air, over the space, looking down.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.602
Like recognizes like,

00:45:55.602 --> 00:45:58.770
and it's going to cast Witch Bolt at fifth level.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.125
SAM: Game recognizes game--
LIAM: That's an attack roll, right?

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:01.958
MATT: It is.

00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:03.646
LIAM: Okay, so it's got to hit me.

00:46:03.646 --> 00:46:05.520
LIAM: It does, yes.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.229
LIAM: Oh, that's a one.
ASHLEY: You have advan--

00:46:07.229 --> 00:46:10.483
LIAM: Hits, not for this, not for that spell.

00:46:10.483 --> 00:46:11.874
MATT: What'd you roll over there?

00:46:11.874 --> 00:46:13.723
LIAM: A one for hitting--

00:46:13.723 --> 00:46:15.706
oh, you didn't even roll to hit.

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.511
MATT: Well, right, but that'll be
the roll when it gets there.

00:46:17.511 --> 00:46:19.460
LIAM: That'll be the roll.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.293
MATT: Natural 20.

00:46:20.293 --> 00:46:21.968
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: I'm not even joking.

00:46:21.968 --> 00:46:23.530
LIAM: I'll take it.
TRAVIS: One and 20.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.743
MATT: That's fucked on Witch Bolt, because it's one of the--

00:46:25.743 --> 00:46:27.903
with attack rolls on spells, you crit.

00:46:27.903 --> 00:46:29.012
LIAM: Bring it.

00:46:29.012 --> 00:46:31.400
MATT: That's 5d12.
LIAM: (shocked whoop)

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.375
MATT: Doubled.

00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:33.975

MARISHA: Doubled.

00:46:33.975 --> 00:46:36.410
LIAM: Look out, y'all. I'm coming.
LAURA: Witch Bolt is a d12?

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.243
MARISHA: We're about to watch

00:46:37.243 --> 00:46:38.784
Caleb plummet from the sky.
MATT: It's a d12,

00:46:38.784 --> 00:46:39.742
and then it's fifth level,

00:46:39.742 --> 00:46:41.526
so it's one d12 every level after.

00:46:41.526 --> 00:46:43.460
SAM: That should be around 60 points, you'll be okay.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.780
TALIESIN: You better be ready on
that fucking heal spell, because--

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.450
MARISHA: How high up are you?

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.920
ASHLEY: That's doubled.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.540
LIAM: I said 30 feet up.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.856
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

00:46:54.042 --> 00:46:55.435
LIAM: I have Counterspell, but I was like,

00:46:55.435 --> 00:46:57.979
"I know this guy can do worse. I'm going to save it."

00:46:57.979 --> 00:47:00.418
LAURA: You can't cancel that crit?

00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:02.501
TALIESIN: Oh, oh, wait wait wait!
LAURA: You can see through the fog!

00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:04.137

00:47:04.137 --> 00:47:04.970
MATT: No.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.660
LAURA: Yeah, he can. You can see
through the fog because he's next to Fjord.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.102
MATT: Actually you can see, yeah.
MARISHA: Oh!

00:47:11.406 --> 00:47:12.810
TALIESIN: Am I close enough?

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.493
I feel like--
MATT: What's the range on it?

00:47:15.697 --> 00:47:19.160
LIAM: I'm 30 feet above deck, which is what I asked for.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.880
TALIESIN: I believe the sp-- it's--

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.232
LAURA: You have to be within 30 feet.

00:47:23.232 --> 00:47:24.500
TALIESIN: I believe it's 30 feet.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.200
MATT: Yeah, so you would not.
TALIESIN: Fuck.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.360
MATT: That is 64 points of--

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.410
LIAM: Isn't his hand eight feet above deck?

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:35.578
I'll take it, great. How much was it?

00:47:35.578 --> 00:47:37.017

MATT: All right, so 64 points of...

00:47:43.502 --> 00:47:45.500
this would be lightning damage.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.333

MATT: Roll a concentration check.

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:53.306
Anything less of a 20 on your advantage

00:47:53.306 --> 00:47:55.911
will cause you to lose concentration on Fly.

00:47:55.911 --> 00:47:57.441
LIAM: Anything less of a 20?
MATT: Correct.

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:59.520

MATT: Yeah, because it's half damage,

00:48:15.474 --> 00:48:16.940

LIAM: I'll cast Feather Fall, though, as I'm falling.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:30.950
MATT: Okay, as a reaction, which you can totally do.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:32.376
So you do not take fall damage.

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:36.150
You drift down into the fog, and now have no visibility.

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.080
You land safely and don't take any additional fall damage,

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.244
but as you touch down,

00:48:39.244 --> 00:48:42.950
you are surrounded in thick white sea fog,

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.590
and have no idea where other folks are.

LIAM: Oh, man.

SAM: Wait, no, I thought that Yasha cut off his hand?

00:49:24.782 --> 00:49:27.740
MATT: He's almost dead. He's just not quite--

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.555

ASHLEY: I think I--

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:32.980
I think I added an extra seven

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.340
by accident on the second hit.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.275
MATT: Oh yeah, the first hit's the one-- got it.

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.280
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.113
Mistake.

00:49:40.113 --> 00:49:41.200
LAURA: So we got extra seven points.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.299
MARISHA: But I still have an advantage on attack rolls.

00:49:43.299 --> 00:49:46.019
MATT: You do. He's still stunned until the end of your turn.

00:49:46.019 --> 00:49:47.960
MARISHA: And he's still stunned until the end of my turn.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.168
MATT: Correct.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.660
LAURA: Is he still stunned until the end of her turn?

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.586
MATT: He's actually still tunned.

00:49:54.586 --> 00:49:56.222
Still tunned.
SAM: Still tunned.

00:49:56.222 --> 00:49:58.243

00:49:59.543 --> 00:50:00.560
Okay, okay.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.256

I'm doing next. I know it's going to change--

00:50:03.256 --> 00:50:07.070

I had all these things planned,

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.520
and it is all--

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.735
MARISHA: I'm just going to try and--

00:50:09.735 --> 00:50:12.510
I'm going to beat this guy's face

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.703
and try and kill him so I can go away.

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.080
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Go for it.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.373
MARISHA: Pop pop.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.173
Oh my god.

00:50:22.173 --> 00:50:23.006
MATT: You have an advantage on these hits,

00:50:23.006 --> 00:50:24.770
because he's stunned, don't forget.

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.753
MARISHA: Okay, okay, right, right, right.

00:50:26.753 --> 00:50:28.085
MATT: Well, that first roll will be the first attack.

00:50:28.085 --> 00:50:30.618
MARISHA: Right, right, and then

00:50:30.618 --> 00:50:32.990
just do them all at once.
ASHLEY: You also have advantage on attack rolls.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.265
LIAM: This is the best.
MARISHA: Right.

00:50:34.265 --> 00:50:37.383
TALIESIN: Advantage on attack rolls.
MARISHA: These are all rough,

00:50:38.492 --> 00:50:39.590
14 for the first one?

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:40.865
MATT: 14 misses.

00:50:40.865 --> 00:50:41.964
MARISHA: 16 for the second one.

00:50:41.964 --> 00:50:43.087
MATT: Just barely hits.

00:50:43.087 --> 00:50:44.410
MARISHA: That's with advantage on both of them.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:45.243
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Wow.

00:50:45.243 --> 00:50:46.296
TRAVIS: Shit. Come on.

00:50:46.296 --> 00:50:47.670
MATT: The first strike, as you're just like--

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.049
MARISHA: I rolled two fours--
MATT: -- smacking.

00:50:49.049 --> 00:50:49.882
MARISHA: -- on the first attack

00:50:49.882 --> 00:50:52.528
and a two and a six on the second one.
MATT: That sucks.

00:50:52.528 --> 00:50:55.310
Impacting against its outer shell. It's still resisting,

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:56.797
but you do manage to push through with the next strike.

00:50:56.797 --> 00:50:59.843
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. With my Belabor,

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:05.350
14, that's actually-- sorry, I was adding plus 10.

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:08.180
It's actually a 16 on the first attack

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.660
and a 18 on the second one.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.571
MATT: Then both would hit.

00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:13.422
MARISHA: Because it's a plus 12 with the Belabor.

00:51:13.422 --> 00:51:14.360
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: That's my bad,

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.193
I am really sorry.

00:51:15.193 --> 00:51:16.026
MATT: That's okay,

00:51:16.026 --> 00:51:17.070
They both hit, then.

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:18.930
MARISHA: Thank you.
MATT: No worries.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.533
SAM: Why are you so good at Dungeons &amp; Dragons?

00:51:20.533 --> 00:51:23.529
(laughter)

00:51:23.529 --> 00:51:24.412
MATT: So the first hit?

00:51:24.412 --> 00:51:28.504
MARISHA: Okay, the first hit is 13 damage.

00:51:28.504 --> 00:51:30.303
MATT: 13 damage, all righty.

00:51:31.966 --> 00:51:33.280
MARISHA: (whispering) Let's get this motherfucker.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.030
MATT: All right, you have a second hit.

00:51:38.082 --> 00:51:40.557
MARISHA: Yes, and then the second hit is 12 damage.

00:51:40.557 --> 00:51:42.400
MATT: 12 damage.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.960
The first strike, as you punk it in the middle of the face,

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.700
you watch it (gurgling).

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.520
It pulls back and begins to gurgle a little bit.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.671
You see where the armor that normally protects

00:51:50.671 --> 00:51:53.330
the part of the head is now caved in and exposed,

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.044
and with the second strike you take the staff

00:51:55.044 --> 00:51:57.010
and jam it in like a utensil,

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:59.330
like you're carving the flesh out of a lobster claw.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.479
And as you put it inside,

00:52:00.479 --> 00:52:03.300
it immediately drops, releasing you.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.133
TRAVIS: Let's go.

00:52:04.133 --> 00:52:05.622
MARISHA: Thank god, okay.

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.790
LAURA: You guys, we're winning this fight.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:08.623
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:52:08.623 --> 00:52:10.090
LIAM: (laughs)

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:11.455
LAURA: It's all turning around.

00:52:11.455 --> 00:52:13.793
SAM: One of the enemies down.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.313
MARISHA: Fuck.

00:52:16.313 --> 00:52:18.672
LAURA: We killed a pawn, you guys!

00:52:18.672 --> 00:52:19.660
MATT: You did it.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.588
TALIESIN: How many player characters?
TRAVIS: We need your help! (pigeon cooing)

00:52:21.588 --> 00:52:22.421
MARISHA: Okay.

00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:23.254
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Help me!

00:52:23.254 --> 00:52:25.040
MARISHA: Step of the wind,

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.470
step of the wind--
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.153
MARISHA: -- so I can disengage.
TRAVIS: I fucked up! (pigeon cooing)

00:52:29.153 --> 00:52:31.970
SAM: I'm in a soup of my own making! (cooing)
MARISHA: And I'm going to go into the fog

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:34.430
where I know that Fjord and Avantika are,

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.777
and that's as far as I know.

00:52:36.777 --> 00:52:37.850
MATT: Okay, you rush in,

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.520
and the first thing you've bump into is Avantika.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.353
MARISHA: (grunts)

00:52:41.353 --> 00:52:42.544
MATT: Because you're not quite sure where anybody is,

00:52:42.544 --> 00:52:44.571
and the direction that you're traveling from,

00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:48.183
the staircase, you run into her.

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.630
MARISHA: Cinematically, that's super cool.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.503
In reality, ho shit.

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.373
Okay.

00:52:57.796 --> 00:52:59.573
That was my bonus action.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.850
Action, bonus action.

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:04.590
MATT: You're good.

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.500
MARISHA: I moved and that's it.
SAM: It's an awkward meet?

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.783
TRAVIS: That's good.
MATT: You have more movement,

00:53:07.783 --> 00:53:08.760
if you want to try and--

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.244
TRAVIS: If she tries to leave,
and you can hit her, she stays.

00:53:11.244 --> 00:53:13.463
LAURA: Oh, that's true, that's true.
LIAM: Keep her rooted to the spot, yeah.

00:53:13.463 --> 00:53:14.579
TRAVIS: That's what I needed.

00:53:14.579 --> 00:53:15.907
MARISHA: That's all I got, that's all I got.

00:53:15.907 --> 00:53:17.860
TRAVIS: Nobody can see in.
LIAM: No, that's gold.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.810
MARISHA: So I'm just going to look at her and go:

00:53:21.313 --> 00:53:22.423
'Sup?

00:53:22.423 --> 00:53:24.090
And then that's it.

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:24.923
MATT: Okay.

00:53:26.602 --> 00:53:30.230
That finished your go. Fjord, you're up.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.902
TRAVIS: Well, nothing like following one bad decision

00:53:32.902 --> 00:53:34.140
with another one, right?

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:34.973
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: Do it.

00:53:34.973 --> 00:53:38.640
TRAVIS: I am going to

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.097
cast Command at 5th-level,

00:53:42.097 --> 00:53:46.736
and say the word "drop."

00:53:46.736 --> 00:53:48.219
MATT: Okay.

00:53:49.968 --> 00:53:52.460
TRAVIS: Because the target drops whatever it is holding

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.063
and then ends its turn.

00:53:55.945 --> 00:53:57.450
LIAM: Oh, that's a great move.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.183
TRAVIS: With a wisdom save of 18.

00:54:00.183 --> 00:54:02.500
MATT: Yeah, at 5th-level you can target other creatures,

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.960
technically, within 60 feet.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.730
TRAVIS: 60 feet?
MATT: Yes.

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.260
Because a higher level doesn't make it harder for them;

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.560
it just has more targets.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.956
TRAVIS: Is that mage within 60 feet?
LIAM: The lobster holding Veth?

00:54:11.956 --> 00:54:13.994
MATT: The mage is not, but the lobster that's holding onto--

00:54:13.994 --> 00:54:15.140
LIAM: Lobster's holding Veth!

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.504
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one, that one, yeah,

00:54:16.504 --> 00:54:17.820
lobster holding Veth.
MATT: Okay.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.670
So roll for the lobster first.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:21.960
SAM: Do they need to understand or anything,

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.328
or does it just work?

00:54:23.328 --> 00:54:26.057
MATT: It magically-- the command goes through to their mind.

00:54:26.057 --> 00:54:28.116
That is a 16. What's the spell DC?

00:54:28.116 --> 00:54:29.173
TRAVIS: For Avantika?

00:54:29.173 --> 00:54:30.470
MATT: No, for the lobster.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:31.380
TRAVIS: It's 18 wisdom.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.940
MATT: Oh yeah, so totally, he drops you.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.965
You are no longer grappled.

00:54:33.965 --> 00:54:35.386
LAURA: Yay!

00:54:35.386 --> 00:54:38.245
LAURA and MARISHA: (mumbling) What about Avantika?

00:54:38.245 --> 00:54:41.810
LAURA: Her wisdom's higher, I think, than the lobster.

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:42.793
MATT: All righty.

00:54:42.793 --> 00:54:44.160
TRAVIS: I'm dying, I'm dying inside.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:44.993
MATT: Avantika,

00:54:47.542 --> 00:54:49.723
with the wisdom bonus,

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:52.558
is a 16.

00:54:52.558 --> 00:54:54.243
ALL: (exclaiming)

00:54:54.243 --> 00:54:57.550
MATT: So as she's putting the orb into her pocket,

00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:00.750
turns and looks over at Beauregard being bumped into,

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.705
and then hears you just shout at her, "Drop it."

00:55:03.705 --> 00:55:06.357
And as she does, the eyes glaze over for a second

00:55:06.357 --> 00:55:08.501
and the orb just,

00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:11.340
(thudding, rolling)

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.100
begins to roll from her feet.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.755
LAURA: Is it rolling under Beau's feet?

00:55:14.755 --> 00:55:17.570
MATT: It's just right in front of her.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.807
So technically it's in the same space as her.

00:55:19.807 --> 00:55:21.679
TALIESIN: You still have enough to grab it.

00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:23.330
MATT: Well, that's your action is casting the spell.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:24.783
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Bonus action?

00:55:26.647 --> 00:55:28.138
TRAVIS: I want to stay--

00:55:28.988 --> 00:55:31.330
It's like right under her feet, right?
MATT: Yeah.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:32.520
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'm right there,

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.353
and Beau's right on the other side.

00:55:33.353 --> 00:55:35.850
We're making a Avantika sandwich.

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:36.970
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Right?

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.130
Is that where we currently are?

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:39.750
If that's not the case, I would like to make sure--

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:40.629
MATT: You're not at the moment.

00:55:40.629 --> 00:55:42.280
If you want to try and squeeze past,

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.740
you can to be full flanking.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.440
TRAVIS: Yeah, that thing.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.243
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:55:50.068 --> 00:55:52.009
TRAVIS: I almost pulled my thumb out of socket.

00:55:52.009 --> 00:55:53.509
MATT: Don't do that.

00:55:53.509 --> 00:55:55.360
TRAVIS: It's all right, it usually goes back in.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.510
MATT: There you go. The fog does move with you.

00:56:00.729 --> 00:56:02.037
There we go.

00:56:03.911 --> 00:56:05.094
All right, that finishes your turn?

00:56:05.094 --> 00:56:06.502
TRAVIS: I think so, I think I chewed on the--

00:56:06.502 --> 00:56:08.084
TALIESIN: Do you have to use an action to pick that up?

00:56:08.084 --> 00:56:09.834
Or is it a bonus action to pick that up?
TRAVIS: I don't have--

00:56:09.834 --> 00:56:11.007
LAURA: Can you grab it with a bonus action?

00:56:11.007 --> 00:56:12.618
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so.

00:56:12.618 --> 00:56:14.903
LAURA: He investigated and he was able to grab it.

00:56:14.903 --> 00:56:17.030
TRAVIS: That was her action.
MATT: That was her action to do that.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.500
LAURA: But she investigated. Isn't investigating an action?

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.510
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was her action.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.278
MATT: She used her action to look for it.

00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:23.170
LAURA: And then she grabbed it.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.003
MATT: Yes, she did.

00:56:24.003 --> 00:56:25.764
TALIESIN: But she's blind and he's not.
LAURA: So you used your action to cast a spell,

00:56:25.764 --> 00:56:27.654
so then you could grab it with your bonus action?

00:56:27.654 --> 00:56:29.390
LIAM: That was scrabbling-- well.

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:30.977
MATT: Her action was looking for it,

00:56:30.977 --> 00:56:32.540
and when she succeeded, so she found it.

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.790
TALIESIN: So the difference is whether or not

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.830
it's because she's blind versus you, who are not,

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.263
whether or not it's a--

00:56:38.263 --> 00:56:40.140
MATT: Correct. I would say--

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.198
TALIESIN: Interesting differential because, yeah.

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:43.578
Oh my god.
MATT: There is--

00:56:43.578 --> 00:56:45.513
TALIESIN: Yeah, she spends her action to pick it up again.

00:56:45.513 --> 00:56:47.400
TRAVIS: We can see, she can't.
MATT: Use object, pick up stuff.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.947
TRAVIS: Now it just goes (impacts) and it's just cloud.

00:56:49.947 --> 00:56:50.780
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.740
TRAVIS: I just needed sentry.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.530
MATT: Yeah. So picking up a weapon, picking up an object

00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.270
can be considered part of an action, generally,

00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:00.350
if it's on the ground.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:04.530
Because you do not have a challenge to see this,

00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:05.890
as part of the action,

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:07.761
I will allow you to pick it up if you want.
TRAVIS: Oh, really?!

00:57:07.761 --> 00:57:09.227
I will pick it up.

00:57:09.227 --> 00:57:10.590
MATT: Because it would be the equivalent of

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:11.850
picking up a dropped weapon that's in your space,

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.804
which you can do as part of an attack action,

00:57:13.804 --> 00:57:14.860
or another action.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.050
Because you are not encumbered by the sight within the fog,

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:18.883
you can do that.

00:57:18.883 --> 00:57:22.924
TRAVIS: Ah! (grunting)

00:57:22.924 --> 00:57:24.073
MATT: What?!

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.331
TRAVIS: I'll just pick it up.
MATT: <i>That's</i> an action.

00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:27.347
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:57:27.347 --> 00:57:28.890
TALIESIN: Lick it.

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:29.822
MATT: All right.

00:57:31.845 --> 00:57:34.860
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, okay.
MATT: Okay.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.730
So you now have the cloven crystal in your grasp.

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:38.898
That ends your turn, Fjord. Yasha, you're up.

00:57:39.782 --> 00:57:41.520
ASHLEY: Oh god, I don't know if I would jump in,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.481
since you guys left.

00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:45.443
If I would stay here.

00:57:45.443 --> 00:57:47.458
Okay, I'll keep fighting these things,

00:57:47.458 --> 00:57:48.558
because we're going to have to fight them

00:57:48.558 --> 00:57:50.277
at some point or another.

00:57:50.277 --> 00:57:51.134
Okay.

00:57:53.516 --> 00:57:55.572
I'm going to take an attack on

00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.827
lobster number one

00:57:58.827 --> 00:58:00.270
MATT: Right there?
ASHLEY: Yup.

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.190
MATT: Okay, go for it. He's the
one who still has you grappled.

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:04.783
So he's the one that's right in front of you.
ASHLEY: Right.

00:58:08.948 --> 00:58:10.614
ASHLEY: That would be...

00:58:12.648 --> 00:58:13.481
15.

00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.910
That doesn't hit, right?
MATT: 15 does not hit.

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:19.789
LAURA: Did you take-- is it--

00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:21.168
MATT: You still have advantage on your attacks.

00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:22.758
ASHLEY: Even though it's on-- it ends--

00:58:22.758 --> 00:58:24.238
MATT: It ends at the end of your next turn.

00:58:24.238 --> 00:58:26.008
So you're still affected by your ability.

00:58:26.008 --> 00:58:27.433
ASHLEY: That's worse! Okay.

00:58:27.433 --> 00:58:29.231
So, uh, second attack.

00:58:32.328 --> 00:58:34.868
Goddamn it. That is 14.

00:58:34.868 --> 00:58:36.308
MATT: You still have advantage.

00:58:36.308 --> 00:58:37.438
ASHLEY: Oh shit, shit, shit.

00:58:37.438 --> 00:58:40.433
Okay, oh yeah, that hits, that hits, okay.

00:58:40.433 --> 00:58:42.676
That's 27.
MATT: 27 does hit. There you go.

00:58:42.676 --> 00:58:44.109
TRAVIS: There's a lot happening.
There's a lot happening.

00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:45.728
MATT: Yeah, it's all good.

00:58:45.728 --> 00:58:48.581
ASHLEY: I'm going to roll again,
Savage Attacker, because that was shit.

00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:50.713
Much better, much better.

00:58:50.713 --> 00:58:52.768
Okay, so that would be...

00:58:55.248 --> 00:58:56.081
30.

00:58:56.081 --> 00:58:58.748
No, sorry. 20.

00:58:58.748 --> 00:59:00.355
Sheesh louise.

00:59:00.355 --> 00:59:01.430
TALIESIN: Pressure's high.
MATT: 20 damage?

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:02.846
Well, this is still your first hit,

00:59:02.846 --> 00:59:05.168
so you get all the damage that you normally would.

00:59:05.168 --> 00:59:08.078
ASHLEY: No, that was my-- because the first hit--

00:59:08.078 --> 00:59:10.662
MATT: The first time you hit, you get
all the bonuses of your subclass.

00:59:10.662 --> 00:59:12.068
So even if you miss the first strike,

00:59:12.068 --> 00:59:13.815
all that carries on to the next attack--

00:59:13.815 --> 00:59:14.864
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:59:14.864 --> 00:59:16.538
Let me roll another one, another--

00:59:16.538 --> 00:59:19.565
MATT: So 20 plus seven plus whatever that is.

00:59:19.565 --> 00:59:22.523
ASHLEY: So that would be...

00:59:24.906 --> 00:59:26.397
25 total.

00:59:26.397 --> 00:59:28.853
MATT: 25-- did you roll a five there?
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:59:28.853 --> 00:59:30.688
MATT: Then plus seven from your--

00:59:30.688 --> 00:59:32.155
ASHLEY: From the radiant-- oh my god.

00:59:32.155 --> 00:59:34.348
MATT: So it's 32 points of damage.

00:59:34.348 --> 00:59:36.117
TRAVIS: Dude.
MATT: There you go.

00:59:36.117 --> 00:59:37.118
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:59:37.118 --> 00:59:38.685
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: Let's go.

00:59:38.685 --> 00:59:39.938
MATT: So with one swipe,

00:59:39.938 --> 00:59:41.688
the first one skids off of its armor.

00:59:41.688 --> 00:59:44.238
As it's holding you, you bring your blade down and jam it

00:59:44.238 --> 00:59:46.747
into its back, and it carves in about a foot and a half

00:59:46.747 --> 00:59:51.348
and you wedge in pull it out with
an arc spray of purple viscera.

00:59:51.348 --> 00:59:55.335
It took a hefty chunk of it in one hit.

00:59:55.335 --> 00:59:56.168
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:59:56.168 --> 00:59:57.634
MATT: That was pretty nice.

00:59:57.634 --> 01:00:00.300
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
MATT: You're still grappled, however.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.741
ASHLEY: Okay, um--

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:05.994
That's all I can do.

01:00:05.994 --> 01:00:07.331
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn, Yasha.

01:00:07.331 --> 01:00:08.738
ASHLEY: Yeah, that finishes my turn.

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.528
MATT: All right, it is now Avantika's turn.

01:00:10.528 --> 01:00:11.488
TRAVIS: Oh god.

01:00:11.488 --> 01:00:12.321
LAURA: But she's commanded--

01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:13.166
MATT: At the front of her turn--

01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:14.270
the fart? At the start of her turn--

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:15.368
(laughter)

01:00:15.368 --> 01:00:17.488
MATT: She farts at the start of her turn.

01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:20.171
She does have to make a saving throw against your--

01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:21.268
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:00:21.268 --> 01:00:22.961
MATT: Which she rolls a--

01:00:26.658 --> 01:00:27.491
21,

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:29.099
so she succeeds, so she takes half damage.

01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:29.990
So go ahead and roll.

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:33.208
TALIESIN: So after half, that's six radiant damage.

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:34.438
MATT: Six radiant damage to Avantika.

01:00:34.438 --> 01:00:37.168
TALIESIN: Does it seem like it's hurting her?

01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:38.398
MATT: She's taking damage, yeah.

01:00:38.398 --> 01:00:40.108
TALIESIN: But she doesn't look like--

01:00:40.108 --> 01:00:43.435
is she undead taking radiant damage kind of damage, or?

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.118
MATT: It doesn't seem to be effecting her any more

01:00:45.118 --> 01:00:46.218
than you would expect.

01:00:47.928 --> 01:00:49.168
TALIESIN: Expect her to be undead,

01:00:49.168 --> 01:00:50.001
all right.

01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:51.801
MATT: Not all undead are vulnerable to radiant.

01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:54.758
TALIESIN: Boo. All right, and she's slowed

01:00:54.758 --> 01:00:56.178
so she moves at half speed right now.

01:00:56.178 --> 01:00:57.978
MATT: Half speed, you got it.

01:00:57.978 --> 01:01:01.038
So she, as she realizes what happened, goes,

01:01:01.038 --> 01:01:02.488
"Oh, you've gotten very tricky

01:01:02.488 --> 01:01:03.999
"since last we met, honey."

01:01:05.118 --> 01:01:06.268
Before she goes for the rapier,

01:01:06.268 --> 01:01:07.468
which is now hanging at the edge of her belt,

01:01:07.468 --> 01:01:09.598
she glances over at you, Beauregard,

01:01:09.598 --> 01:01:11.268
and then even slowed, is going to try

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:12.388
and dodge around the side.

01:01:12.388 --> 01:01:14.958
You do get an attack on her, if you want to.

01:01:14.958 --> 01:01:15.791
MARISHA: Sentinel.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:16.778
MATT: Sentinel. Go for it.

01:01:16.778 --> 01:01:18.298
TRAVIS: I thought in the description of Command,

01:01:18.298 --> 01:01:20.308
it says the target drops whatever it is holding

01:01:20.308 --> 01:01:22.169
and then ends its turn.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:28.928
MATT: "Must succeed a wisdom save or follow the command

01:01:28.928 --> 01:01:31.417
"on its next turn."

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:33.018
That's an interesting point of order.

01:01:33.018 --> 01:01:35.588
So technically it wouldn't have dropped the orb

01:01:35.588 --> 01:01:37.086
until this turn.

01:01:37.086 --> 01:01:38.238
TRAVIS: Got it, okay.

01:01:38.238 --> 01:01:40.178
SAM: So you don't have it?

01:01:40.178 --> 01:01:41.011
TRAVIS: It's on the ground.

01:01:41.011 --> 01:01:42.201
MATT: Correct. So now it's on the ground.

01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:43.808
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:01:43.808 --> 01:01:45.248
SAM: But she doesn't get an action.

01:01:45.248 --> 01:01:46.428
MATT: She doesn't get an action.

01:01:46.428 --> 01:01:47.261
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:01:48.947 --> 01:01:50.738
MATT: Been a while since we've done the Command spell.

01:01:50.738 --> 01:01:51.571
TRAVIS: Totally.

01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:53.334
MARISHA: So.

01:01:54.237 --> 01:01:55.403
TRAVIS: It's kind of good and kind of bad.

01:01:55.403 --> 01:01:57.858
MATT: So she uses her action to drop

01:01:57.858 --> 01:02:00.183
the orb and it's there on the ground.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.942
MARISHA: Is she still trying to bolt?

01:02:02.942 --> 01:02:04.549
Now what is she doing?

01:02:06.428 --> 01:02:08.094
MATT: Right now?

01:02:08.094 --> 01:02:09.938
No, she's going to stay put. It's right at her feet

01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:12.395
and she's just at a "come at me" type positioning.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.228
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:02:13.228 --> 01:02:15.340
MATT: She's gauging everyone.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.438
She can vaguely see shapes

01:02:16.438 --> 01:02:19.513
to the right and left and in front of her,

01:02:20.398 --> 01:02:21.808
so she's going to hold her position

01:02:21.808 --> 01:02:22.908
and put her feet

01:02:22.908 --> 01:02:25.048
over where the orb currently is,

01:02:25.048 --> 01:02:28.965
and is preparing to go for it next chance she gets. So.

01:02:28.965 --> 01:02:29.798
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:02:29.798 --> 01:02:31.248
MATT: Does kind of waste her turn.

01:02:33.408 --> 01:02:34.748
MARISHA: Okay.

01:02:34.748 --> 01:02:36.258
SAM: She knows where it is, too.

01:02:36.258 --> 01:02:37.546
MATT: So that's her turn.

01:02:37.546 --> 01:02:39.212
She just ends it there.
TRAVIS: It's right between her feet, right?

01:02:39.212 --> 01:02:40.998
Like, she just dropped it.

01:02:40.998 --> 01:02:41.938
MATT: On the ground.

01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:42.848
It's rolled a little bit.

01:02:42.848 --> 01:02:43.918
TRAVIS: That's fine.

01:02:43.918 --> 01:02:47.288
MATT: That ends-- fuck, that fucks up her turn.

01:02:47.288 --> 01:02:48.868
Top of its turn, the other creature is going to

01:02:48.868 --> 01:02:50.918
and go ahead and make a save against you.

01:02:51.918 --> 01:02:53.368
Which-- it rolls a natural 20,

01:02:53.368 --> 01:02:54.626
so it makes it save. But go ahead and--

01:02:54.626 --> 01:02:57.284
so it takes half damage to your Spiritual Guardians.

01:02:57.284 --> 01:02:59.238
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:59.238 --> 01:03:01.268
One, two, three, four.

01:03:01.268 --> 01:03:03.298
One, two, three, four.

01:03:03.298 --> 01:03:04.489
Where's my other?

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.322
Okay.

01:03:06.622 --> 01:03:07.780
Ooh!

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:13.928
28 points of radiant damage on that.

01:03:13.928 --> 01:03:14.761
MATT: Nice.

01:03:14.761 --> 01:03:17.931
So it takes 14 points of radiant damage.

01:03:19.758 --> 01:03:22.091
Oh, that's the wrong one. There we go.

01:03:22.935 --> 01:03:24.980
14. (unhappy gurgling)

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.518
It's going to go ahead and immediately lash

01:03:26.518 --> 01:03:29.328
into you out of anger and frustration at the damage.

01:03:29.328 --> 01:03:30.318
LAURA: The little froggy guy?

01:03:30.318 --> 01:03:31.155
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Okay.

01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:32.572
MATT: Because he's right there next to you.

01:03:32.572 --> 01:03:34.180
First strike is going to be...

01:03:36.468 --> 01:03:37.663
21 to hit.

01:03:37.663 --> 01:03:39.768
LAURA: Okay.

01:03:39.768 --> 01:03:42.101
MATT: All right, so you take

01:03:42.101 --> 01:03:44.458
14 points of slashing damage.

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:45.291
LAURA: Okay.

01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:47.365
MATT: Second strike is going to be

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:48.818
26 to hit.

01:03:48.818 --> 01:03:50.358
LAURA: Wow, okay.

01:03:50.358 --> 01:03:53.292
MATT: That's going to be 13 points of slashing damage.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.168
LAURA: Cool.
MATT: And constitution--

01:03:55.168 --> 01:03:56.978
Constitution checks on each of these.

01:03:56.978 --> 01:03:58.128
You just have to beat a 10.

01:04:00.111 --> 01:04:01.818
With advantage.

01:04:01.818 --> 01:04:02.651
LAURA: Okay, that works.

01:04:02.651 --> 01:04:04.358
MATT: There are constitution saving throws.

01:04:04.358 --> 01:04:05.258
LAURA: Both of them save.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.591
MATT: Okay, third one.

01:04:07.828 --> 01:04:08.978
That's cocked, actually.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.554
That's going to be another 21.

01:04:12.554 --> 01:04:13.589
LAURA: Okay.

01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:15.714
MATT: That one you take

01:04:15.714 --> 01:04:17.605
17 points of slashing damage.

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:20.361
Go ahead and make another attack with the advantage--

01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:21.919
or another constitution saving throw

01:04:21.919 --> 01:04:23.459
with advantage .
TRAVIS: This is all from that big fucker?

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.059
LAURA: The little frog!
MATT: The little frog thing.

01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:26.328
TRAVIS: Goddamn, that thing's a monster.

01:04:26.328 --> 01:04:30.598
MATT: Mind you, it's still nine feet and wide as fuck.

01:04:30.598 --> 01:04:31.958
LAURA: He's not a little frog,

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:33.780
he's a big scary frog.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.535
That's-- I save.

01:04:35.535 --> 01:04:37.668
MATT: And as soon as it finishes that,

01:04:37.668 --> 01:04:39.528
it vanishes from behind you.

01:04:39.528 --> 01:04:42.453
LAURA: Wait, before-- during that,

01:04:42.453 --> 01:04:45.609
could I have use reaction on him before he did?
MATT: You can use a reaction in the middle of it, yeah.

01:04:45.609 --> 01:04:47.370
LAURA: Can I say I did my Hellish Rebuke on him?

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:49.620
MATT: Yeah, you can. Yes, you can indeed.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.886
So he has to make a constitution saving throw against you,

01:04:51.886 --> 01:04:52.719
or reflex?

01:04:52.719 --> 01:04:54.901
LAURA: I don't know?! Hold on, let me--!

01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:57.147
Where's my Hellish Rebuke?!

01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:58.868
Where's the spell?

01:04:58.868 --> 01:05:00.216
Oh, there it is. Okay.

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:02.274
It's a dexterity.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:03.798
MATT: Dexterity. 16.

01:05:03.798 --> 01:05:05.206
LAURA: He saves.

01:05:05.206 --> 01:05:06.039
MATT: So he takes half damage.

01:05:06.039 --> 01:05:07.811
LAURA: Half damage, 3d10.

01:05:09.288 --> 01:05:11.471
MATT: And is going to (poofing)

01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:13.637
right back over next to Caleb,

01:05:13.637 --> 01:05:18.478
who has just faintly landed on the outskirts the fog.

01:05:18.478 --> 01:05:20.611
LAURA: So he took eight points, so it was a 16.

01:05:20.611 --> 01:05:21.527
MATT: You got it.

01:05:23.288 --> 01:05:25.013
All right, that finishes its go.

01:05:25.013 --> 01:05:28.718
Now, the rest of the crab creatures're going to go.

01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:30.078
The one that's still in front of you

01:05:30.078 --> 01:05:32.678
is going to go ahead and take a wisdom save.

01:05:32.678 --> 01:05:33.511
And it's going to fail,

01:05:33.511 --> 01:05:34.826
so roll damage for the--

01:05:34.826 --> 01:05:36.738
LAURA: I roll again or he just takes the same damage

01:05:36.738 --> 01:05:37.804
that I rolled before?

01:05:37.804 --> 01:05:39.828
MATT: We can do either. I mean, like.

01:05:39.828 --> 01:05:42.958
I will say, because it's a different initiative turn,

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:43.862
go ahead and roll damage.

01:05:43.862 --> 01:05:46.445
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:05:47.738 --> 01:05:49.358
LIAM: My mind's going in, like, seven directions.

01:05:49.358 --> 01:05:50.191
If this happens, then this.

01:05:50.191 --> 01:05:51.858
If this happens, then this.

01:05:51.858 --> 01:05:53.118
TRAVIS: Branching narrative going on here.
LAURA: 22.

01:05:53.118 --> 01:05:54.201
MATT: 22, nice.

01:05:56.588 --> 01:06:00.488
It gets sparked from the floating around massive swarm

01:06:00.488 --> 01:06:02.794
of celestial unicorn hamsters,

01:06:03.798 --> 01:06:07.361
and then shifts its way across the ship here

01:06:08.738 --> 01:06:12.218
to try and shore up its positioning against Veth

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:15.078
and is going to attack Veth twice.

01:06:15.078 --> 01:06:17.348
First strike, it's cocked.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.068
Oh, that's a real bad one.

01:06:19.068 --> 01:06:20.860
That's 11.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.536
SAM: Hey, that misses.

01:06:22.536 --> 01:06:23.698
TRAVIS: Real bad.

01:06:23.698 --> 01:06:26.245
MATT: Yep, and that's going to be a 17 to hit.

01:06:26.245 --> 01:06:27.568
SAM: Misses!

01:06:27.568 --> 01:06:29.068
MATT: Both giant pincers swings.

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:31.488
You duck out of the way and then tumble roll

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.078
and catch yourself on the ground,

01:06:33.078 --> 01:06:35.211
no impact on you.

01:06:35.211 --> 01:06:37.168
That finishes its go.

01:06:37.168 --> 01:06:38.648
This one, it has you grappled,

01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:41.413
Yasha, it's going to go ahead and strike at you twice.

01:06:41.413 --> 01:06:43.468
The first one is a natural 20.

01:06:43.468 --> 01:06:45.445
ASHLEY: That definitely hits.

01:06:45.445 --> 01:06:46.861
TALIESIN: I am not within range. Nope.

01:06:46.861 --> 01:06:48.053
MATT: Unfortunately.

01:06:48.053 --> 01:06:49.078
TALIESIN: Am I?

01:06:49.078 --> 01:06:50.611
MATT: Within 30 feet? You are not.

01:06:50.611 --> 01:06:51.668
ASHLEY: I'm also raging, so.

01:06:51.668 --> 01:06:52.928
MATT: You are, so you'll just take half damage,

01:06:52.928 --> 01:06:54.558
which is good.

01:06:54.558 --> 01:06:56.801
So you take on that one...

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:04.568
18 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half, so nine.

01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:10.178
And the second attack is going to be a nine.

01:07:10.178 --> 01:07:11.538
So yeah.

01:07:11.538 --> 01:07:12.558
SAM: Oh great.

01:07:12.558 --> 01:07:15.798
MATT: The first, its other pincer goes to grab

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:16.788
towards you and you duck

01:07:16.788 --> 01:07:18.638
out of the way as it closes its other one,

01:07:18.638 --> 01:07:20.188
that's still holding it even tighter around you

01:07:20.188 --> 01:07:22.018
and squeezes and fills you with pain

01:07:22.018 --> 01:07:24.228
as it does tentacles unfurl

01:07:24.228 --> 01:07:25.061
from under its armor

01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:26.088
and making the latch up your body.

01:07:26.088 --> 01:07:27.804
Make constitution saving throw for me, please.

01:07:27.804 --> 01:07:30.087
ASHLEY: Ooh, okay.

01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:33.912
Natural 20.

01:07:33.912 --> 01:07:35.338
TRAVIS: Oh, come on!

01:07:35.338 --> 01:07:37.104
MATT: No effect from the poison.

01:07:37.104 --> 01:07:38.758
MARISHA: Woo!

01:07:38.758 --> 01:07:40.878
MATT: This guy here is going to--

01:07:40.878 --> 01:07:42.181
ASHLEY: I haven't rolled one of those...

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:47.418
MATT: Chitter down into the fog

01:07:48.728 --> 01:07:51.878
and begin to push its way towards Caduceus,

01:07:51.878 --> 01:07:53.526
whatever it runs into in this space

01:07:53.526 --> 01:07:54.998
and the first thing that comes into is Caduceus.

01:07:54.998 --> 01:07:57.128
TALIESIN: So immediately upon entering the field,

01:07:57.128 --> 01:07:57.961
it takes damage.

01:07:57.961 --> 01:07:59.102
MATT: It does.

01:07:59.102 --> 01:08:00.468
TALIESIN: Before it even gets anywhere near me

01:08:00.468 --> 01:08:03.268
and then it also gets its movement halved for 15 feet.

01:08:03.268 --> 01:08:04.491
MATT: Correct, so at--

01:08:07.608 --> 01:08:08.441
it can't quite get to you.

01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:09.368
TALIESIN: Nope, can't.

01:08:09.368 --> 01:08:10.676
So let's take some damage.

01:08:10.676 --> 01:08:11.509
MATT: Yeah.

01:08:12.448 --> 01:08:14.248
TALIESIN: Do a save, I guess.

01:08:14.248 --> 01:08:16.341
MATT: It's just out of the range to get

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.821
to actually attack you.

01:08:18.748 --> 01:08:19.968
Oh, but it has a reach of 10

01:08:19.968 --> 01:08:21.688
with its pincers, so, no, it is in range.

01:08:21.688 --> 01:08:23.298
TALIESIN: Well, first to take some damage, anyway.

01:08:23.298 --> 01:08:24.131
MATT: Indeed.

01:08:24.131 --> 01:08:25.978
So it's a natural one on its save.

01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:27.198
So it takes full damage.

01:08:27.198 --> 01:08:28.906
TALIESIN: That's,

01:08:28.906 --> 01:08:33.906
six, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14.

01:08:34.028 --> 01:08:36.518
LAURA: Do your beetles do more damage than my hamsters?

01:08:36.518 --> 01:08:37.351
TRAVIS: Go Bears.

01:08:38.618 --> 01:08:39.451
SAM: Maybe it's just as bad.

01:08:39.451 --> 01:08:40.598
LIAM: Puppy Bowl.

01:08:40.598 --> 01:08:42.488
TALIESIN: One, hold on one second, sorry, sorry,

01:08:42.488 --> 01:08:44.578
just doing math.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:45.421
MARISHA: So cute.

01:08:48.938 --> 01:08:52.168
SAM: Use D&amp;D Beyond's rolling feature!

01:08:52.168 --> 01:08:54.868
TALIESIN: Fuck off.
(laughter)

01:08:56.188 --> 01:08:57.728
TALIESIN: 21 points of radiant damage.

01:08:57.728 --> 01:08:59.008
MATT: Okay, nice.

01:08:59.008 --> 01:09:00.418
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.

01:09:00.418 --> 01:09:02.221
LAURA: Just barely.

01:09:04.818 --> 01:09:06.198
But he did cast it at a 4th-level.

01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:07.548
MATT: So is that blasts across,

01:09:07.548 --> 01:09:09.088
and this one's looking pretty dang hurt

01:09:09.088 --> 01:09:10.780
at this point. It's like (gurgling).

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.998
It's going ahead and swing twice

01:09:11.998 --> 01:09:12.878
at you with its pincers.

01:09:12.878 --> 01:09:14.388
The first one. They have disadvantage

01:09:14.388 --> 01:09:15.768
on each because they're in the fog

01:09:15.768 --> 01:09:16.741
and you are technically partially obscured.

01:09:16.741 --> 01:09:18.791
It's just swinging at a shape in the fog.

01:09:20.382 --> 01:09:21.215
Natural one.

01:09:21.215 --> 01:09:24.038
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case, it misses me with an attack,

01:09:24.038 --> 01:09:26.273
so I'm going to use my reaction

01:09:26.273 --> 01:09:28.498
to blast them with arcane force.

01:09:28.498 --> 01:09:29.331
MATT: Okay.

01:09:31.856 --> 01:09:35.064
TALIESIN: That's-- let's see.

01:09:38.647 --> 01:09:39.480
10.

01:09:40.998 --> 01:09:43.041
20 points of force damage.

01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:44.468
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Whoa.

01:09:44.468 --> 01:09:46.618
MATT: Here. Because right now--

01:09:46.618 --> 01:09:47.884
Fjord moved away from next to you,

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:50.538
so your visibility has faded in the fog.

01:09:50.538 --> 01:09:53.368
You felt something swing towards you,

01:09:53.368 --> 01:09:55.358
go ahead and--

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.038
TALIESIN: The shield just has a reaction, so.

01:09:57.038 --> 01:09:59.288
MATT: No, I understand. This is me trying

01:09:59.288 --> 01:10:01.068
to see if you're able to actually aim it

01:10:01.068 --> 01:10:02.318
in the right direction from something,

01:10:02.318 --> 01:10:04.278
without knowing something's there.

01:10:04.278 --> 01:10:05.768
So just roll a perception check for me.

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.668
You're super easy at that.

01:10:07.668 --> 01:10:09.268
TALIESIN: I don't have any advantage on that, do I?

01:10:09.268 --> 01:10:10.101
MATT: You have disadvantage on it,

01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:12.118
because you're in heavy-- you're obscured fog,

01:10:12.118 --> 01:10:14.650
but you don't have to roll super high.

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.908
SAM: Fucking fog.

01:10:16.908 --> 01:10:17.910
TALIESIN: Thank god, because I--

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:19.488
No, never mind. That's good. 25.

01:10:19.488 --> 01:10:21.497
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. So go ahead.
That's 20 damage, you said?

01:10:21.497 --> 01:10:24.243
TALIESIN: 20 damage and then make a
strength saving throw, if you're still alive.

01:10:24.243 --> 01:10:25.484
MATT: It doesn't need to.

01:10:25.484 --> 01:10:26.317
As you turn this way,

01:10:26.317 --> 01:10:29.895
the shield blasts off this burst of arcane force damage,

01:10:29.895 --> 01:10:34.895
and you watch as faint shadows of something just disappears.

01:10:34.958 --> 01:10:37.228
The rest of you see, firing out of the fog,

01:10:37.228 --> 01:10:39.065
a rain of calamari chunks.

01:10:39.065 --> 01:10:39.898
(laughter)

01:10:39.898 --> 01:10:42.482
Just scatters on the side of the ship.

01:10:42.482 --> 01:10:44.755
MARISHA: We're going to eat good tonight.

01:10:44.755 --> 01:10:46.124
TALIESIN: Yasha, was that you?

01:10:46.124 --> 01:10:48.541
Oh, sorry!
(laughter)

01:10:50.318 --> 01:10:52.595
MATT: Well done.
TRAVIS: I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

01:10:52.595 --> 01:10:54.588
MATT: All right, that's going to finish their go.

01:10:54.588 --> 01:10:57.088
Veth, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

01:10:57.088 --> 01:10:59.018
SAM: Good gravy.

01:10:59.018 --> 01:11:01.526
I've got two giant lobsters behind me, right?

01:11:01.526 --> 01:11:04.798
And there's a big cloud fog thing.

01:11:04.798 --> 01:11:06.918
Still have advantage on my attack from Yasha, right?

01:11:06.918 --> 01:11:07.798
TALIESIN: No.

01:11:07.798 --> 01:11:08.770
ASHLEY: No.

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:10.445
SAM: What?!
ASHLEY: Ends at my turn.

01:11:10.445 --> 01:11:13.466
SAM: You poopy head.

01:11:13.466 --> 01:11:16.484
ASHLEY: Well, you know, I do what I can.

01:11:16.484 --> 01:11:18.370
SAM: How do I?

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.298
TRAVIS: ♪ How do I ♪
LAURA: You're not grappled anymore.

01:11:20.298 --> 01:11:22.658
SAM: I know, but I can't do sneak attack

01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:24.128
unless the one that's engaged

01:11:24.128 --> 01:11:26.526
with me is engaged with somebody else.

01:11:26.526 --> 01:11:27.661
Are they? No.

01:11:29.141 --> 01:11:30.758
LAURA: Can't you run away from it?

01:11:30.758 --> 01:11:32.357
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Run away from it.

01:11:32.357 --> 01:11:34.165
SAM: Into the fog.
LAURA: Stop talking.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.741
SAM: Then I can't see anyone.

01:11:37.178 --> 01:11:38.928
MARISHA: Yeah, you can if you stand by Fjord.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:40.728
SAM: I don't know where Fjord is.

01:11:40.728 --> 01:11:42.551
MARISHA: Run into the fog and find out.

01:11:42.551 --> 01:11:44.792
TRAVIS: (pigeon coo) Help me!

01:11:46.034 --> 01:11:47.167
(pigeon coo) All the regrets!

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:48.000
SAM: What?

01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:51.937
Oh shit.

01:11:57.598 --> 01:12:00.168
So no lobsters near me are engaged.

01:12:00.168 --> 01:12:03.309
And is anyone I can see engaged with somebody else?

01:12:04.818 --> 01:12:06.250
MATT: At the moment,

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:10.368
there is the weird, toad demon creature

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:14.299
that is harrying the shape of a person in the fog, yes.

01:12:14.299 --> 01:12:15.607
Oh, by the way, Beauregard, I forgot to mention

01:12:15.607 --> 01:12:17.095
because you did get one attack on Avantika,

01:12:17.095 --> 01:12:19.157
you do take 25 points of cold damage.

01:12:19.157 --> 01:12:21.058
MARISHA: Wait, what, why, what?

01:12:21.058 --> 01:12:21.891
TRAVIS: 25 points of cold damage?

01:12:21.891 --> 01:12:23.633
LAURA: Because she's got the fucking armor.

01:12:23.633 --> 01:12:25.678
MATT: That icy--

01:12:25.678 --> 01:12:26.511
TRAVIS: Agathys.

01:12:26.511 --> 01:12:29.478
MATT: Armor of Agathys that is currently protecting her.

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:31.328
So just--
MARISHA: 25 points of cold?

01:12:31.328 --> 01:12:32.528
MATT: Yeah, so mark that down.

01:12:33.442 --> 01:12:35.268
MARISHA: Okay, I take back what I just told you.

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:36.641
Now it's different.

01:12:38.028 --> 01:12:40.728
SAM: All right, if I see that thing is engaged with someone,

01:12:40.728 --> 01:12:42.074
I will attack it.

01:12:42.074 --> 01:12:43.448
TRAVIS: That was the max.

01:12:43.448 --> 01:12:44.281
MATT: I'll say, yeah.

01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:45.680
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.
SAM: Yeah?

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.368
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

01:12:47.368 --> 01:12:51.941
I will, bonus action, charge up my Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.

01:12:51.941 --> 01:12:52.774
MATT: You got it.

01:12:52.774 --> 01:12:54.008
SAM: And then I will--

01:12:54.008 --> 01:12:57.035
Wait, that's my 3rd-level spell. That's okay.

01:12:57.035 --> 01:13:01.618
And then I will shoot aiming...

01:13:01.618 --> 01:13:03.597
True.

01:13:03.597 --> 01:13:05.730
No!
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:09.697
Rogue natural ability or whatever!

01:13:09.697 --> 01:13:11.234
SAM: 15?
LIAM: Doesn't affect attack rolls.

01:13:11.234 --> 01:13:12.293
MATT: 15 does not hit.

01:13:12.293 --> 01:13:13.851
SAM: Argh!
ASHLEY: No!

01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:17.576
MATT: (sizzling) (firing) (air whooshing)

01:13:17.576 --> 01:13:18.708
Off into the ocean.

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:21.118
You watch as this distant flare of a spark just disappears

01:13:21.118 --> 01:13:23.191
into the storm in the distance.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.538
SAM: And then I will use my movement to run into the fog.

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:32.178
You, Matthew Mercer, get to pick where you think I would go,

01:13:32.178 --> 01:13:35.476
because I haven't seen anyone in there for a while.

01:13:35.476 --> 01:13:37.716
I'm just trying to find action.

01:13:37.716 --> 01:13:41.037
LAURA: Would you've Fjord yell, "Drop it"?
MATT: Roll a d4.

01:13:41.037 --> 01:13:44.128
MARISHA: ♪ Into the unknown! ♪
MATT: One, two, three, four.

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:45.628
That's the arc spread them on there.

01:13:45.628 --> 01:13:46.998
SAM: Two.
MATT: Two.

01:13:46.998 --> 01:13:50.318
All right, you run into the fog,

01:13:50.318 --> 01:13:51.848
charging around the side

01:13:51.848 --> 01:13:55.098
and head, bumping right

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:57.008
in between Fjord and Caduceus.

01:13:57.008 --> 01:13:58.728
SAM: Oh, so I can see them?

01:13:58.728 --> 01:13:59.753
MATT: You can see them, yes.

01:13:59.753 --> 01:14:01.108
And you can see Avantika.

01:14:01.108 --> 01:14:01.941
SAM: Cool.

01:14:01.941 --> 01:14:03.599
MARISHA: Wait, can he see Beau, too?

01:14:03.599 --> 01:14:04.515
MATT: No.
MARISHA: Oh.

01:14:04.515 --> 01:14:06.201
TALIESIN: Oh wait. Isn't she--
MARISHA: I heard Nott.

01:14:06.201 --> 01:14:08.001
TALIESIN: -- sharing an edge with Fjord?

01:14:08.982 --> 01:14:10.988
MATT: Actually, yeah, because
you see through the fog entirely.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:12.363
So yeah. So you can see Beauregard.

01:14:13.518 --> 01:14:15.134
However, there's an attack of opportunity

01:14:15.134 --> 01:14:17.876
against you from the creature,

01:14:17.876 --> 01:14:19.175
and if it does hit, that'll change this

01:14:19.175 --> 01:14:20.297
because it will grapple you.

01:14:20.297 --> 01:14:21.897
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: Oh no.

01:14:21.897 --> 01:14:24.630
TRAVIS: Doesn't it roll with-- Oh, no.

01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:27.638
MATT: It does roll a 12 to hit,

01:14:27.638 --> 01:14:29.855
so you duck out of the way,

01:14:29.855 --> 01:14:31.600
dart past into the fog.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.328
You are snow blind for a second

01:14:33.328 --> 01:14:35.138
and then all of a sudden everything clarifies

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:37.718
and it's just a faint layer of gray around everything.

01:14:37.718 --> 01:14:41.188
You can clearly see everything in the cloud around you,

01:14:41.188 --> 01:14:42.998
including Avantika standing between the group

01:14:42.998 --> 01:14:45.638
of you with the orb on the ground right there.

01:14:45.638 --> 01:14:46.471
Does that finish your turn?

01:14:46.471 --> 01:14:47.607
SAM: Yep, that's it.
TALIESIN: Have you taken damage?

01:14:47.607 --> 01:14:49.432
MATT: All right. Caleb, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.

01:14:49.432 --> 01:14:52.178
LIAM: Oh, I am in the kill box and low on HP

01:14:52.178 --> 01:14:54.648
and I don't want anyone to have to worry about healing me,

01:14:54.648 --> 01:14:55.923
so from out of the fog

01:14:55.923 --> 01:14:57.764
a T-rex lumbers up--

01:14:57.764 --> 01:15:02.347
TRAVIS: Yes! Let it go, baby!
LIAM: -- out of the fog!

01:15:02.347 --> 01:15:03.180
TRAVIS: Let's go!

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.697
LAURA: Yes, and he has a T-rex!

01:15:04.697 --> 01:15:06.255
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:07.605
(laughter)

01:15:07.605 --> 01:15:08.946
MARISHA: What is this?

01:15:08.946 --> 01:15:11.988
LAURA: T-rex fight on a boat!

01:15:11.988 --> 01:15:15.139
LIAM: Turn me around, Matt. Face me the other way.

01:15:15.139 --> 01:15:16.998
TRAVIS: Fuck your D&amp;D game!

01:15:16.998 --> 01:15:19.472
LIAM: Swivel me around the other way, sir.

01:15:19.472 --> 01:15:21.355
MATT: The other way?
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:23.188
(laughter)

01:15:23.188 --> 01:15:25.563
LAURA: This fight is everything!

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:26.654
MATT: There you go.

01:15:26.654 --> 01:15:29.495
LIAM: (like Stefon from SNL) This boat has everything.

01:15:29.495 --> 01:15:32.608
(laughter)

01:15:32.608 --> 01:15:35.178
LIAM: And with my move, because that's my action.

01:15:35.178 --> 01:15:36.808
So with my-- because I can't attack, right?

01:15:36.808 --> 01:15:38.548
Because casting Polymorph just gets me there.

01:15:38.548 --> 01:15:39.818
So with my movement,

01:15:39.818 --> 01:15:44.528
I am going to lumber and squeeze. Use my 50 feet of movement

01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:47.718
to bully my way towards the center

01:15:47.718 --> 01:15:49.468
so I can get my face right

01:15:49.468 --> 01:15:52.733
into the fish mage's face, if possible,

01:15:52.733 --> 01:15:54.168
between the stairs.

01:15:54.168 --> 01:15:56.159
MATT: So you're going to attempt to step over.

01:15:56.159 --> 01:16:00.244
Unfortunately, this guy is blocking your movement.

01:16:00.244 --> 01:16:01.798
LIAM: Which guy, lobster guy?

01:16:01.798 --> 01:16:02.648
MATT: The lobster guy, yeah.

01:16:02.648 --> 01:16:05.128
LIAM: That doesn't become just difficult terrain

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:07.208
for my massive miniature?

01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:08.908
MATT: If it's a mini--

01:16:08.908 --> 01:16:10.528
if it was a medium-sized creature,

01:16:10.528 --> 01:16:11.361
I'd say yes.

01:16:11.361 --> 01:16:13.278
He's large enough to be an issue.

01:16:13.278 --> 01:16:15.718
LIAM: What if I absolutely destroyed the ballista

01:16:15.718 --> 01:16:17.468
behind me to get there?

01:16:19.628 --> 01:16:21.528
SAM: You'd have to use an attack to--

01:16:21.528 --> 01:16:22.561
LIAM: I'll stomp on it.

01:16:24.218 --> 01:16:25.051
MATT: You know what?

01:16:25.051 --> 01:16:27.111
Go ahead and make a strength check.

01:16:28.488 --> 01:16:30.857
MARISHA: This is officially an Asylum film.

01:16:30.857 --> 01:16:34.465
(laughter)

01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:35.631
ASHLEY: Yes!

01:16:37.538 --> 01:16:38.758
LIAM: That's a 20.

01:16:38.758 --> 01:16:40.398
MATT: 20, that beats an 18.

01:16:40.398 --> 01:16:42.814
So yeah, I'll say you do manage to step on it

01:16:42.814 --> 01:16:46.115
and push over to get to where you're wanting to go.

01:16:46.115 --> 01:16:49.258
LIAM: (yells)

01:16:49.258 --> 01:16:52.438
MARISHA: Arctic-Rex 24!

01:16:52.438 --> 01:16:53.518
MATT: You stomp over and--

01:16:53.518 --> 01:16:54.351
LIAM: And if you'll allow,

01:16:54.351 --> 01:16:57.628
the whole point is to get my big toothy maw,

01:16:57.628 --> 01:17:00.278
breathing hot air in the mage's face.

01:17:00.278 --> 01:17:01.111
MATT: Certainly.

01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:04.019
LIAM: (low growling breaths)

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:07.465
TRAVIS: So good, dude. So! Good!

01:17:07.465 --> 01:17:09.078
MATT: Sure, there we go.

01:17:09.078 --> 01:17:11.383
There we go. D&amp;D.

01:17:11.383 --> 01:17:12.774
LIAM: Yeah!

01:17:12.774 --> 01:17:13.682
ASHLEY: ♪ It's D&amp;D! ♪
SAM: That looks like

01:17:13.682 --> 01:17:16.153
a bunch of toys from my son's toy drawer.

01:17:16.153 --> 01:17:16.986
MATT: Yeah.

01:17:16.986 --> 01:17:19.211
(laughter)
TRAVIS: This is amazing.

01:17:19.211 --> 01:17:20.088
MATT: All right.

01:17:20.088 --> 01:17:21.631
MARISHA: (like a movie trailer) The killer lobster--

01:17:21.631 --> 01:17:24.048
MATT: So as all of you are there in the middle of the fog,

01:17:24.048 --> 01:17:27.198
all staring at Avantika in this

01:17:27.198 --> 01:17:29.028
standoff moment, looking at each other,

01:17:29.028 --> 01:17:32.348
you suddenly hear (roars).

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.388
You all glance over into the corner of the fog:

01:17:34.388 --> 01:17:36.688
there's a T-rex on your boat,

01:17:36.688 --> 01:17:39.848
in the middle of the arctic ocean, the Frigid Depths.

01:17:39.848 --> 01:17:43.160
As he just walks away (stomping footsteps).

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.068
You do get an attack of opportunity

01:17:44.068 --> 01:17:47.167
from the crustacean as you move past.

01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:50.125
That is a...

01:17:52.716 --> 01:17:54.488
15 to hit?
LIAM: It hits.

01:17:54.488 --> 01:17:56.538
MATT: All right. That does, however,

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:59.523
hold you back because you are grappled by it from the--

01:17:59.523 --> 01:18:00.528
LIAM: Doesn't he have Veth in it?

01:18:00.528 --> 01:18:02.218
Oh, no, he missed her, right?

01:18:02.218 --> 01:18:03.051
SAM: I scrambled away.

01:18:03.051 --> 01:18:05.138
MATT: You do take 14 points of bludgeoning damage,

01:18:05.138 --> 01:18:07.628
and you're not quite to your quarry

01:18:07.628 --> 01:18:10.858
because you're being held back by a giant piece of calamari.

01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:12.233
LIAM: Am I 10 feet away?

01:18:12.233 --> 01:18:13.538
MATT: You are.

01:18:13.538 --> 01:18:15.808
So yes, you are in range.
LIAM: Okay.

01:18:15.808 --> 01:18:18.568
LAURA: That T-rex is coming down.
TRAVIS: That is so Jurassic Park 2.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:20.166
MATT: Oh, it'll be fine, what are you talking about?

01:18:20.166 --> 01:18:21.191
It's going to be great.

01:18:21.191 --> 01:18:23.045
It's going to last forever, you guys.

01:18:23.045 --> 01:18:24.278
(laughter)

01:18:24.278 --> 01:18:26.494
SAM: I want Jester to polymorph--
LAURA: T-rex is going to take out the whole map.

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:27.927
MATT: This is a great--
ASHLEY: Oh! Oh!

01:18:27.927 --> 01:18:31.121
SAM: I want you to polymorph into a Lego guy--
TRAVIS: It's moving!

01:18:31.121 --> 01:18:32.671
SAM: -- or, like, a matchbox car

01:18:32.671 --> 01:18:36.004
just so we can make this map even weirder.
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh no!

01:18:37.638 --> 01:18:40.008
LIAM: Hold me up, barbarian dude.

01:18:40.008 --> 01:18:41.508
MATT: Let's go ahead and close that door there.

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:43.449
ASHLEY: He was trying so hard to hold on.
TRAVIS: We've got an open door.

01:18:43.449 --> 01:18:45.406
This ship is awesome.

01:18:45.406 --> 01:18:47.072
LAURA: Oh my god.
MATT: There we go.

01:18:47.072 --> 01:18:48.368
Sure.
LAURA: Ah!

01:18:48.368 --> 01:18:50.048
MATT: Fuck all y'all, it's fine.

01:18:50.048 --> 01:18:50.881
LAURA: It's going to work.

01:18:50.881 --> 01:18:53.798
MATT: Thanks for making a T-rex on a boat, Liam! Goddamn it.

01:18:53.798 --> 01:18:55.315
SAM: Oh no!

01:18:55.315 --> 01:18:57.745
LIAM: Hey, man, you Witch Bolted me so hard.

01:18:57.745 --> 01:19:01.869
MATT: I did, I did. Not my fault; enemies did it.

01:19:02.966 --> 01:19:05.508
All right. Sure, sure. It's fine.
(cheering)

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:07.408
LIAM: Another circle for the Olympics.

01:19:07.408 --> 01:19:08.638
MATT: We'll leave it how it went.

01:19:08.638 --> 01:19:10.228
You're in range, you're a T-rex,

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:12.129
you can hit him, it's fine.
SAM: One more circle, guys.

01:19:12.129 --> 01:19:13.203
We can do this.

01:19:13.203 --> 01:19:14.850
LIAM: Someone put down in the area of effect spell.

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.847
ASHLEY: Oh no, it's falling again.

01:19:16.847 --> 01:19:18.996
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh no!

01:19:18.996 --> 01:19:20.171
ASHLEY: I love how he was like--

01:19:20.171 --> 01:19:22.468
MATT: I'm just going to chuck you in the ocean, man.

01:19:22.468 --> 01:19:25.426
All right, that finish your turn, Caleb?!

01:19:25.426 --> 01:19:27.588
LIAM: (laughing) Yes.
MATT: Okay.

01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:29.621
Jester, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

01:19:30.468 --> 01:19:33.568
LAURA: I'm going to--
TRAVIS: I love it. Such a good session.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:34.635
LAURA: Oh god.

01:19:34.635 --> 01:19:37.378
(laughter)
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:19:37.378 --> 01:19:38.994
LAURA: I'm going to run down.

01:19:38.994 --> 01:19:41.948
(laughter)

01:19:41.948 --> 01:19:42.781
MATT: I love this game.

01:19:42.781 --> 01:19:43.614
TRAVIS: I know!

01:19:46.168 --> 01:19:48.718
LAURA: There's still another lobster up by Yasha.

01:19:48.718 --> 01:19:50.768
MATT: Correct. There are two on the deck.

01:19:50.768 --> 01:19:54.618
LAURA: I'm going to use my
spiritual weapon to attack the lobster.

01:19:54.618 --> 01:19:55.858
MATT: Go for it.

01:19:55.858 --> 01:20:00.318
It moves over and is easily within range.

01:20:00.318 --> 01:20:02.068
LAURA: That's a natural one.

01:20:02.068 --> 01:20:03.259
MATT: That misses.

01:20:03.259 --> 01:20:04.658
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Big whiff.

01:20:04.658 --> 01:20:08.931
LAURA: I'm going to run into the fog.

01:20:09.998 --> 01:20:11.306
MATT: Okay.

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.881
SAM: ♪ Into the unknown ♪

01:20:13.881 --> 01:20:15.130
MATT: Roll a d4 for me.

01:20:15.130 --> 01:20:17.396
MARISHA: ♪ Into the unknown ♪

01:20:19.588 --> 01:20:20.958
LAURA: Three?

01:20:20.958 --> 01:20:23.182
MATT: Okay. You run into Caduceus.

01:20:23.182 --> 01:20:24.938
LAURA: Oh! Okay.
TALIESIN: Ah, again, everybody.

01:20:24.938 --> 01:20:26.248
MATT: You are still blinded.

01:20:26.248 --> 01:20:29.148
You do not see anything in the space.

01:20:29.148 --> 01:20:32.945
SAM: Does she see Caduceus or smell his musk?

01:20:32.945 --> 01:20:35.471
MATT: At your passive perception?

01:20:35.471 --> 01:20:36.304
Not quite.

01:20:38.478 --> 01:20:39.922
LAURA: And that's as far as I can get?

01:20:39.922 --> 01:20:40.755
MATT: That's far as you can get.

01:20:40.755 --> 01:20:42.951
You are blocked between the ballista and your friends.

01:20:42.951 --> 01:20:44.788
You can try and push through your friends if you want to,

01:20:44.788 --> 01:20:46.218
but you're moving--

01:20:46.218 --> 01:20:48.138
Oh, I guess. Well, what do you want to do?

01:20:48.138 --> 01:20:51.246
LAURA: If I can shout

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:53.971
and try to walk as far as I can.

01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:55.143
MATT: Actually, no, that's as far as you can get

01:20:55.143 --> 01:20:56.509
because you can only move five more feet

01:20:56.509 --> 01:20:59.318
and those two spaces next to you are occupied by friends.

01:20:59.318 --> 01:21:00.998
So you either move to the left or right,

01:21:00.998 --> 01:21:02.478
but you can't move forward any more.

01:21:02.478 --> 01:21:03.728
LAURA: Okay.

01:21:05.678 --> 01:21:07.635
Then--
ASHLEY: How close do you have to be

01:21:07.635 --> 01:21:08.502
to be able to see in the fog?

01:21:08.502 --> 01:21:09.835
LAURA: I can't really--
SAM: Right next to.

01:21:09.835 --> 01:21:11.868
LAURA: Is my spiritual guardians,

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:14.038
are they at least protecting?

01:21:14.038 --> 01:21:16.778
Do they still count as protecting everything

01:21:16.778 --> 01:21:19.028
within 15 feet of me, if I can't see the things?

01:21:19.028 --> 01:21:20.169
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Yes?

01:21:20.169 --> 01:21:21.528
MATT: Yeah. They're still hitting things around you.

01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:23.168
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: You're just not focusing on them.

01:21:23.168 --> 01:21:25.636
SAM: Audience can't see any of these minis either.

01:21:25.636 --> 01:21:26.469
MATT: Yep.

01:21:26.469 --> 01:21:27.904
(laughter)

01:21:27.904 --> 01:21:29.141
MATT: Hey.

01:21:29.141 --> 01:21:30.268
You guys are throwing shit

01:21:30.268 --> 01:21:31.438
down to obscure the battlefield,

01:21:31.438 --> 01:21:32.988
not my fault.

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:34.598
Sorry.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.006
LAURA: Dang it, I had wanted to heal,

01:21:37.306 --> 01:21:38.831
for the first time ever.

01:21:41.288 --> 01:21:42.368
SAM: But you forgot?

01:21:42.368 --> 01:21:44.668
LAURA: No, I just can't see anybody.
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:21:44.668 --> 01:21:45.776
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's my fault.

01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:47.992
LIAM: Really, it's just like (inaudible) at the Olympics.

01:21:47.992 --> 01:21:48.880
SAM: That's right.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.888
TRAVIS: Went a lot differently in my head.

01:21:50.888 --> 01:21:51.721
LIAM: Oh yeah.

01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:54.603
TALIESIN: Did you think that any of your
friends could see in there no matter what?

01:21:54.603 --> 01:21:57.718
TRAVIS: No, I just thought I would meet somebody over there.

01:21:57.718 --> 01:21:59.578
LIAM: Oh man, I was like, going
to be back to back with Fjord,

01:21:59.578 --> 01:22:01.228
knocking spells out of the air. Here we go.

01:22:01.228 --> 01:22:02.558
TALIESIN: I mean, I kind of got there.

01:22:02.558 --> 01:22:04.824
LAURA: I'm going to hold an attack

01:22:04.824 --> 01:22:07.558
until I can see something,

01:22:07.558 --> 01:22:10.361
I'm going to hold a spell until I can see an enemy.

01:22:11.878 --> 01:22:14.408
Do I have to clarify which enemy?

01:22:14.408 --> 01:22:16.308
MATT: You have to clarify what spell you're casting,

01:22:16.308 --> 01:22:18.688
and you're just saying until you see an enemy?

01:22:18.688 --> 01:22:20.296
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

01:22:20.296 --> 01:22:22.971
LAURA: I'm going to hold Guiding Bolt

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:24.329
until I can see an enemy.

01:22:24.329 --> 01:22:26.286
MATT: You got it.
MARISHA: Until you can sea anemone.

01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:28.798
(laughter)

01:22:28.798 --> 01:22:29.631
MATT: Well done.

01:22:30.888 --> 01:22:32.528
LIAM: Crawl up the side of the deck.

01:22:32.528 --> 01:22:34.778
MATT: Does that finish your turn? Okay.

01:22:34.778 --> 01:22:35.619
MARISHA: Here it comes!
LAURA: I'm worthless.

01:22:35.619 --> 01:22:37.610
MATT: Jester hits at the end. Caduceus, you're up.
MARISHA: I swear it's coming.

01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:39.408
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl my way

01:22:39.408 --> 01:22:42.088
over to where I saw Fjord move, very slowly,

01:22:42.088 --> 01:22:44.851
so I can tap him for some view, so I can see shit.

01:22:46.638 --> 01:22:49.638
MATT: You would have to move into range.

01:22:49.638 --> 01:22:51.568
You could move in and square in.

01:22:51.568 --> 01:22:53.759
TALIESIN: Yeah, try to get behind him.
MATT: Or are you going to scoot off to the side?

01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:54.592
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:22:55.668 --> 01:22:57.601
MATT: So you can move around over here

01:22:57.601 --> 01:22:59.198
to get to get within five feet of him to see the space.

01:22:59.198 --> 01:23:00.031
TALIESIN: That's perfect.

01:23:00.031 --> 01:23:01.208
MATT: There you go.

01:23:01.208 --> 01:23:03.358
TALIESIN: All right. Now I'm--

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:05.124
MATT: My god. You fuckers with all of your--

01:23:08.318 --> 01:23:10.258
TALIESIN: And she's still within my 15 feet, right?

01:23:10.258 --> 01:23:11.618
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:23:11.618 --> 01:23:15.176
Then I'm going to cast-- where did it go?

01:23:15.176 --> 01:23:16.543
LAURA: Is she within my 15 feet?

01:23:16.543 --> 01:23:18.144
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Yes.

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:22.712
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast--
MATT: Your overlapping guardians. (fluttering)

01:23:23.628 --> 01:23:25.128
LAURA: I like to imagine that a couple

01:23:25.128 --> 01:23:26.208
of the beetles have climbed

01:23:26.208 --> 01:23:29.316
on top of some of my flying unicorns, are holding onto them.

01:23:29.316 --> 01:23:30.745
MARISHA: Riding them?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:30.745 --> 01:23:32.503
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds

01:23:32.503 --> 01:23:34.736
to try and get everybody who needs it

01:23:34.736 --> 01:23:37.644
into the 30-foot circle.

01:23:37.644 --> 01:23:38.477
MARISHA: Oh.

01:23:39.358 --> 01:23:41.218
TALIESIN: So you can use my current 30-foot circle.

01:23:41.218 --> 01:23:42.858
I'm going to try and get Beau,

01:23:42.858 --> 01:23:44.178
I don't know if I can get Jester,

01:23:44.178 --> 01:23:45.368
I'm going to try.

01:23:45.368 --> 01:23:47.728
MATT: Which spell are you doing?
TALIESIN: Mass Cure Wounds.

01:23:47.728 --> 01:23:49.028
LAURA: I'm right next you.

01:23:49.028 --> 01:23:51.386
TALIESIN: Yeah, but I drop a point

01:23:51.386 --> 01:23:53.978
to make a 30-foot radius thing.
LAURA: Oh, I see.

01:23:53.978 --> 01:23:55.961
MATT: So this will drop your spiritual guardians, then?

01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:59.368
TALIESIN: No, it's not concentration.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.789
MATT: Wait, Mass Cure Wounds is instantaneous.

01:24:01.789 --> 01:24:03.418
I was making sure it wasn't a concentration thing.

01:24:03.418 --> 01:24:04.934
TALIESIN: No, no, no.
MATT: Okay, cool.

01:24:04.934 --> 01:24:07.198
That's what I thought.
TALIESIN: So it's a 30-foot.

01:24:07.198 --> 01:24:08.188
Yeah.

01:24:08.188 --> 01:24:10.828
Up to six creatures and 30-foot radius sphere centered on

01:24:10.828 --> 01:24:12.048
any point within 60 feet.

01:24:12.048 --> 01:24:15.429
So I'm going to try and get Beau and Jester

01:24:15.429 --> 01:24:17.081
and see if I can get--

01:24:17.081 --> 01:24:19.298
MATT: You can get everybody in this space here

01:24:19.298 --> 01:24:20.439
without a problem.
TALIESIN: All right.

01:24:20.439 --> 01:24:22.755
So that's 5th-level.

01:24:22.755 --> 01:24:24.678
MATT: That's everybody except for Yasha.

01:24:24.678 --> 01:24:25.867
SAM: Yeah, but he can't see where anyone is.

01:24:25.867 --> 01:24:28.971
MATT: Everybody except Yasha and Caleb's T-rex.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.018
I was like, "Where's Caleb's mini? Oh, right."
LIAM: C-Rex!

01:24:33.018 --> 01:24:36.051
TALIESIN: Everybody gets-- that's okay.

01:24:37.978 --> 01:24:40.415
20 points, everybody gets 20 points.

01:24:40.415 --> 01:24:41.338
MARISHA: That's great.
MATT: Nice.

01:24:41.338 --> 01:24:42.171
LAURA: That's great.

01:24:44.278 --> 01:24:47.843
TALIESIN: And then-- yeah.

01:24:47.843 --> 01:24:51.178
And I'm good.

01:24:51.178 --> 01:24:52.011
That's my--

01:24:52.011 --> 01:24:54.278
I don't really have a bonus action or anything to--

01:24:55.795 --> 01:24:57.128
I don't think I have any bonus actions

01:24:57.128 --> 01:24:59.004
that are really that interesting.

01:24:59.004 --> 01:24:59.903
No.
MATT: Okay.

01:24:59.903 --> 01:25:01.328
TALIESIN: No, that's what's I got.
MATT: That finishes your turn?

01:25:01.328 --> 01:25:02.994
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

01:25:02.994 --> 01:25:03.827
All right.

01:25:03.827 --> 01:25:05.478
TALIESIN: So you got 20. You got 20.

01:25:05.478 --> 01:25:07.488
MATT: This crew here is now going
to try and turn the ballista

01:25:07.488 --> 01:25:12.246
to fire upon this crab creature,

01:25:12.246 --> 01:25:13.713
rotating around. There's too much there.

01:25:13.713 --> 01:25:15.830
I'm just going to say it's facing them. It's fine.

01:25:18.788 --> 01:25:23.413
No, that is a 12. That shoots past.

01:25:23.413 --> 01:25:26.120
This bolt, as it's about to fire, the runes in the front go,

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.468
(magical whooshing)

01:25:27.468 --> 01:25:29.888
and you watch as energy begins

01:25:29.888 --> 01:25:31.658
to arc through this large metal

01:25:31.658 --> 01:25:32.858
arrow-like bolt.

01:25:32.858 --> 01:25:34.608
And as he releases it,

01:25:34.608 --> 01:25:37.980
it bolts fast with an impossible amount of force and speed

01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:39.408
and it's just a little bit too wide,

01:25:39.408 --> 01:25:42.458
but it seems to go straight for an extended distance.

01:25:42.458 --> 01:25:44.593
These are some powerful ballista.

01:25:44.593 --> 01:25:45.893
LAURA: Good to know.

01:25:45.893 --> 01:25:47.751
MATT: So.
TRAVIS: How did you miss?

01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:48.717
No, I'm just kidding.

01:25:48.717 --> 01:25:50.108
MATT: Because the creature was grabbing onto the front of it

01:25:50.108 --> 01:25:51.983
and wrestling with it. He's like (screaming).

01:25:51.983 --> 01:25:54.488
TALIESIN: You might have three creatures in your--

01:25:54.488 --> 01:25:55.928
by the way.
MATT: All righty.

01:25:55.928 --> 01:25:57.788
That's going to finish their go. That one over there,

01:25:57.788 --> 01:26:00.118
can't see where to aim and is currently holding on

01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:01.358
looking for something to aim towards,

01:26:01.358 --> 01:26:04.018
but is currently stuck in the fog cloud.

01:26:04.018 --> 01:26:06.805
That brings us to the mage up here who's next to you.

01:26:06.805 --> 01:26:07.638
LIAM: Yeah.

01:26:07.638 --> 01:26:08.863
SAM: That's maj.

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.511
MATT: The T-rex is a problem.

01:26:12.511 --> 01:26:17.268
(laughter)

01:26:17.268 --> 01:26:18.118
TRAVIS: That's a meme.

01:26:18.118 --> 01:26:19.348
MATT: But--

01:26:19.348 --> 01:26:20.648
MARISHA: The T-rex is a problem.

01:26:20.648 --> 01:26:22.257
TRAVIS: T-rex is a problem.

01:26:22.257 --> 01:26:24.188
MATT: But it does have priorities

01:26:24.188 --> 01:26:25.838
and it is an intelligent creature.

01:26:25.838 --> 01:26:28.858
So it's going to still stay within your range

01:26:28.858 --> 01:26:30.328
and move over to this side

01:26:30.328 --> 01:26:33.591
and is going to cast Dispel Magic on the fog cloud,

01:26:34.768 --> 01:26:36.738
which vanishes.

01:26:36.738 --> 01:26:37.571
SAM: Thank god.

01:26:37.571 --> 01:26:39.488
TRAVIS: I didn't think it could be the dispelled.

01:26:39.488 --> 01:26:40.888
MATT: Any magical effect

01:26:40.888 --> 01:26:42.978
can be dispelled if it's targeted directly

01:26:42.978 --> 01:26:45.052
and unless it states otherwise.

01:26:45.052 --> 01:26:47.548
TALIESIN: Weren't you holding an attack?

01:26:47.548 --> 01:26:49.388
MATT: Now you can see things.
LAURA: I was until I could see!

01:26:49.388 --> 01:26:51.255
MATT: You can see. Who are you going after?

01:26:51.255 --> 01:26:52.308
LAURA: Avantika!

01:26:52.308 --> 01:26:53.868
MATT: Go for it, roll an attack.

01:26:53.868 --> 01:26:55.500
LAURA: Okay.

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.486
TRAVIS: "Cannot be dispersed." That's fine.

01:26:58.486 --> 01:27:00.964
LAURA: Okay. So that's an attack roll.

01:27:03.108 --> 01:27:06.328
TRAVIS: Dispersed. I'm not going to argue with him!

01:27:06.328 --> 01:27:07.648
I think dispersed by natural means.

01:27:07.648 --> 01:27:08.628
LAURA: 20.

01:27:08.628 --> 01:27:09.461
MATT: 20 misses.

01:27:09.461 --> 01:27:11.144
SAM: Like wind.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:27:11.144 --> 01:27:12.548
MATT: As you're holding the bolt and

01:27:12.548 --> 01:27:15.188
you unleash it, Avantika-- you let it go,

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:16.168
and you're sure it would hit,

01:27:16.168 --> 01:27:18.398
and as soon as your vision clarifies,

01:27:18.398 --> 01:27:20.946
she's already dodged to the side and it just moves by.

01:27:20.946 --> 01:27:23.027
LAURA: She's really hard to hit.

01:27:24.378 --> 01:27:25.447
SAM: She wasn't for Fjord.

01:27:25.447 --> 01:27:28.613
ALL: Oh!

01:27:28.613 --> 01:27:29.446
LAURA: Wait.

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:31.812
Oh.

01:27:34.138 --> 01:27:34.971
MATT: All right.

01:27:34.971 --> 01:27:36.907
MARISHA: Wait, what'd you roll?

01:27:36.907 --> 01:27:38.343
LAURA: 20.

01:27:38.343 --> 01:27:39.919
MARISHA: And you missed?

01:27:39.919 --> 01:27:41.558
MATT: And is just going to stay within your combat range.

01:27:41.558 --> 01:27:43.308
It's going to finish his movement over here,

01:27:43.308 --> 01:27:45.428
still within your 10-foot

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:47.148
reach of your maw.

01:27:47.148 --> 01:27:49.138
But it's now maneuvering between you

01:27:49.138 --> 01:27:50.278
and the battlefield below

01:27:50.278 --> 01:27:52.908
and is trying to keep concentrated in two spaces.

01:27:52.908 --> 01:27:56.378
That's going to mark that spell there.

01:27:56.378 --> 01:27:57.211
All righty.

01:27:57.211 --> 01:27:59.652
Now it is Beauregard's turn. Fjord, you're on deck.

01:27:59.652 --> 01:28:02.502
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:28:02.502 --> 01:28:04.088
Okay.

01:28:04.088 --> 01:28:06.458
Where's the crystal?

01:28:06.458 --> 01:28:08.172
MATT: It's in Avantika's space.

01:28:08.172 --> 01:28:10.221
TRAVIS: Between her feet.
MATT: Yes.

01:28:12.168 --> 01:28:13.058
SAM: It's like--

01:28:13.058 --> 01:28:13.891
TRAVIS: Right next to you.

01:28:13.891 --> 01:28:15.774
SAM: Right on it.

01:28:15.774 --> 01:28:16.615
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:28:16.615 --> 01:28:21.359
No, I'm just trying to think of what's the right move here.

01:28:24.578 --> 01:28:25.438
If I go for it,

01:28:25.438 --> 01:28:27.931
is it going to be a contested dex roll or something?

01:28:27.931 --> 01:28:29.858
MATT: It would be. She's protecting it.

01:28:29.858 --> 01:28:30.778
It's not in your space.

01:28:30.778 --> 01:28:32.138
If an object is in your space,

01:28:32.138 --> 01:28:35.098
you can pick it up with a movement,
but because the drop spell

01:28:35.098 --> 01:28:36.608
dropped it in her space,

01:28:36.608 --> 01:28:37.441
she's defending it.

01:28:37.441 --> 01:28:39.638
It would be a contested element here.
LIAM: Oh, let's go, ninja.

01:28:39.638 --> 01:28:42.508
SAM: If you're reaching between her legs,

01:28:42.508 --> 01:28:44.764
Henry Crabgrass would like a word with you--

01:28:44.764 --> 01:28:46.955
(laughter)

01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:47.797
SAM: -- about consent.

01:28:47.797 --> 01:28:49.474
MARISHA: The consent grass, yeah.

01:28:49.474 --> 01:28:50.891
MATT: (as Henry) "Just make sure
you check in with her first."

01:28:50.891 --> 01:28:52.691
(laughter)

01:28:52.691 --> 01:28:53.524
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:28:55.338 --> 01:28:57.608
I'm not going to waste any actions or doing--

01:28:57.608 --> 01:28:59.058
I'm going to just go for it,

01:28:59.058 --> 01:29:00.705
I'm going for it.

01:29:00.705 --> 01:29:01.538
LIAM: Get that football.

01:29:01.538 --> 01:29:03.578
MATT: Going for--?
MARISHA: The crystal.

01:29:03.578 --> 01:29:05.028
MATT: Okay. So you're using your action

01:29:05.028 --> 01:29:07.218
to attempt to grab the crystal. All right.

01:29:07.218 --> 01:29:08.821
So this would be a contested...

01:29:11.538 --> 01:29:15.204
We'll say a contested athletics or acrobatics.

01:29:15.204 --> 01:29:16.612
LIAM: Oh yeah.

01:29:16.612 --> 01:29:17.520
MARISHA: All right.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.353
LIAM: Come on, jock.

01:29:19.188 --> 01:29:20.531
MARISHA: Do I have any advantage?

01:29:20.531 --> 01:29:21.629
TRAVIS: Which one you taken?

01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:22.829
MATT: There is no advantage.

01:29:22.829 --> 01:29:24.468
MARISHA: Both are the same.

01:29:24.468 --> 01:29:25.301
Both are the same,

01:29:25.301 --> 01:29:27.988
so I'm going to say acrobatics,

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:29.598
as I try to.

01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:31.318
MATT: This is you both trying to maneuver

01:29:31.318 --> 01:29:32.151
through and her to try

01:29:32.151 --> 01:29:33.638
and deflect you and go for it herself.

01:29:33.638 --> 01:29:35.768
LIAM: Hacky sack it into your hands, dude.

01:29:35.768 --> 01:29:37.178
MARISHA: Lucky jade, lucky jade dice.

01:29:37.178 --> 01:29:38.011
TRAVIS: He already rolled.

01:29:38.011 --> 01:29:39.119
LIAM: Come on, come on.

01:29:39.119 --> 01:29:40.310
MARISHA: He already rolled?

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:42.078
LIAM: Come on, come on.

01:29:42.078 --> 01:29:43.128
MARISHA: 20 total.

01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:44.006
MATT: 28.

01:29:44.006 --> 01:29:45.006
ALL: Oh!

01:29:46.098 --> 01:29:48.107
MATT: Rolled a natural 16. She's real quick.

01:29:48.107 --> 01:29:48.940
LIAM: Ooh!

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.038
MARISHA: So what does that mean?

01:29:50.038 --> 01:29:51.868
MATT: It means you try and reach for it,

01:29:51.868 --> 01:29:53.688
and she kicks it out of your grasp and you try

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:54.658
and go for it again,

01:29:54.658 --> 01:29:56.388
and she blocks the way and knocks you

01:29:56.388 --> 01:29:57.221
off to the side

01:29:57.221 --> 01:30:00.808
and kicks it back like a soccer player--

01:30:00.808 --> 01:30:03.156
or football for our non-US friends--

01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:05.681
player keeping the ball and guarding it through its legs.

01:30:05.681 --> 01:30:07.597
LIAM: <i>Allez, allez, allez, allez.</i>

01:30:07.597 --> 01:30:08.668
TRAVIS: With all of that dribbling,

01:30:08.668 --> 01:30:10.283
does she manage to keep it within her space?

01:30:10.283 --> 01:30:13.078
MATT: She keeps within her
own space, but it is a failed grasp.

01:30:13.078 --> 01:30:14.811
You still have your bonus action and your move.

01:30:14.811 --> 01:30:17.228
LIAM: I was sure you had that. Goddamn.

01:30:17.228 --> 01:30:19.303
MARISHA: Fuck.
TALIESIN: I mean.

01:30:19.303 --> 01:30:20.242
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

01:30:20.242 --> 01:30:23.476
TRAVIS: Can you put your finger
right above where Avantika is?

01:30:23.476 --> 01:30:24.442
MATT: See that purple thing?

01:30:24.442 --> 01:30:25.526
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: That's her.

01:30:25.526 --> 01:30:26.851
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:28.109
MATT: Yeah.

01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.982
SAM: (as Henry) You should've asked.

01:30:28.982 --> 01:30:32.148
MARISHA: All right. Well. Well. All right.

01:30:32.148 --> 01:30:34.289
MATT: It was like damn good try. The dice weren't with it,

01:30:34.289 --> 01:30:35.232
but that was a good try.

01:30:35.232 --> 01:30:37.688
MARISHA: I didn't roll great. Okay.

01:30:37.688 --> 01:30:42.688
I might as well Flurry of Blows her
and see if I can stun her.

01:30:42.861 --> 01:30:45.548
MATT: You can only Flurry of Blows
if use your attack action.

01:30:45.548 --> 01:30:46.381
But you can do it--

01:30:46.381 --> 01:30:47.428
MARISHA: Patient Defense!

01:30:47.428 --> 01:30:48.889
MATT: Okay, Patient Defense, you got it.

01:30:48.889 --> 01:30:50.697
(laughter)

01:30:50.697 --> 01:30:53.125
MARISHA: Damn it!
LIAM: Grandma Patient Defense.

01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:55.418
MATT: (like an old woman) Come at me!

01:30:55.418 --> 01:30:56.408
All right, that finishes Beau's go.

01:30:56.408 --> 01:30:57.848
Fjord, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

01:30:57.848 --> 01:30:58.681
LIAM: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

01:31:00.338 --> 01:31:04.978
TRAVIS: So is she effectively against the side of the ship?

01:31:04.978 --> 01:31:06.878
MATT: Yeah, you're all up against the edge of the ship

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:09.298
and you and Beauregard are on one side

01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:11.338
and the rest of your friends are off to the edge.

01:31:11.338 --> 01:31:14.478
TRAVIS: So if I stayed in her
melee range and rotated around,

01:31:14.478 --> 01:31:15.878
could I get on--

01:31:15.878 --> 01:31:19.698
could I put myself in front of her with the side of the ship

01:31:19.698 --> 01:31:20.881
and the ocean beyond it?

01:31:21.758 --> 01:31:22.658
MATT: You could, yeah.

01:31:23.738 --> 01:31:25.396
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and do that.

01:31:25.396 --> 01:31:26.229
MATT: Okay.

01:31:27.368 --> 01:31:29.558
So you're going to maneuver through Veth

01:31:29.558 --> 01:31:31.066
to get on that end?
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

01:31:31.066 --> 01:31:31.899
MATT: Okay.

01:31:34.008 --> 01:31:35.098
TRAVIS: I'm just going to double check this.

01:31:35.098 --> 01:31:38.758
My dexterity is balls.

01:31:38.758 --> 01:31:40.018
It just sucks.
TALIESIN: Athletics

01:31:40.018 --> 01:31:42.288
if you want to try a different stat--

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:43.578
TRAVIS: Athletics for a different--

01:31:43.578 --> 01:31:45.628
TALIESIN: Strength contest versus dex.

01:31:45.628 --> 01:31:47.378
MATT: Depends on what you're trying to do, buddy.

01:31:51.938 --> 01:31:55.878
TRAVIS: If I wanted to shove her
off of the ship, off the side,

01:31:55.878 --> 01:31:57.678
would that be strength or athletics?

01:31:58.838 --> 01:32:02.371
MATT: That would be your,

01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:06.990
I'd say for this, it would be your athletics.

01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:10.028
TRAVIS: All right. I'm going to try
and shove her off of the ship.

01:32:10.028 --> 01:32:11.519
MATT: You got it. Okay.

01:32:11.519 --> 01:32:13.868
TRAVIS: Because either way, it's the
same as trying to grab it.

01:32:13.868 --> 01:32:16.498
MATT: Go ahead and make your athletics check.

01:32:16.498 --> 01:32:17.834
TRAVIS: I don't have advantage on this, right?

01:32:17.834 --> 01:32:19.737
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: No.

01:32:19.737 --> 01:32:21.003
Just thought I'd check.

01:32:21.895 --> 01:32:23.228
LAURA: No!

01:32:23.228 --> 01:32:24.411
TRAVIS: 11.

01:32:24.411 --> 01:32:25.476
MATT: 11.

01:32:25.476 --> 01:32:26.771
This would be 22.

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:30.486
So as you attempted to shove into her with your shoulder to

01:32:30.486 --> 01:32:31.778
push her off the side,

01:32:31.778 --> 01:32:35.008
she, like, puts her hand on the side and judo spins

01:32:35.008 --> 01:32:36.038
you out of the way.

01:32:36.038 --> 01:32:38.428
And you find yourself almost about to topple off the ship

01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:39.568
yourself with the momentum.

01:32:39.568 --> 01:32:41.348
And she's preparing to go ahead and kick

01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:43.383
the back of your chest and put you over,

01:32:43.383 --> 01:32:46.058
and you catch it and maneuver back into space you were,

01:32:46.058 --> 01:32:47.568
and you both are back in this standoff.

01:32:47.568 --> 01:32:52.068
TRAVIS: Wow, wow, wow, wow. That was terrible.

01:32:52.068 --> 01:32:53.328
MATT: Once again, it's a game of chance.

01:32:53.328 --> 01:32:55.088
With a good roll, that would've really fucked her up.

01:32:55.088 --> 01:32:56.855
TRAVIS: You're totally right.

01:32:56.855 --> 01:32:58.298
MATT: I love it, I love the risk.

01:32:58.298 --> 01:33:00.208
TRAVIS: Bonus action, bonus action, bonus action.

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:01.821
There's just not much to do.

01:33:04.890 --> 01:33:07.873
I think that's the rest of my--

01:33:09.035 --> 01:33:09.873
I'll--

01:33:09.873 --> 01:33:11.668
I will use the rest of my movement to put myself back

01:33:11.668 --> 01:33:14.358
in a flanking position with Beau
on the opposite side of her.

01:33:14.358 --> 01:33:16.778
Nope. I'm going to stay there.
MATT: You're going to stay there?

01:33:16.778 --> 01:33:18.591
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay there. Yeah.

01:33:18.591 --> 01:33:21.998
Just in case she tries to fucking pull me into the sea.

01:33:21.998 --> 01:33:24.039
MATT: All right, Yasha, you're up.

01:33:24.039 --> 01:33:25.328
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:33:25.328 --> 01:33:28.428
I'm still fighting this thing.

01:33:28.428 --> 01:33:32.969
So is Jester's spiritual weapon still there?

01:33:32.969 --> 01:33:34.231
LAURA: It is.
ASHLEY: Or that's--

01:33:34.231 --> 01:33:36.439
Yeah? Okay, so.

01:33:39.658 --> 01:33:42.158
Is there some way I can try to take a shot,

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:44.761
but also pull them into her spiritual weapon?

01:33:47.165 --> 01:33:49.768
MATT: You mean. I would allow you to,

01:33:49.768 --> 01:33:52.518
if you wanted to, attempt to pull it into spiritual weapon

01:33:52.518 --> 01:33:54.148
instead of your attack,

01:33:54.148 --> 01:33:55.893
it would take the spiritual weapon damage.

01:33:55.893 --> 01:33:57.018
ASHLEY: What's your spiritual weapon damage?

01:33:57.018 --> 01:33:58.326
LAURA: It's probably not as good as your attack.

01:33:58.326 --> 01:34:01.473
It's 2d8 plus five.

01:34:01.473 --> 01:34:03.473
ASHLEY: That's pretty good. Okay.

01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:05.848
I'll take a first hit.

01:34:05.848 --> 01:34:06.718
MATT: Go for it.

01:34:06.718 --> 01:34:07.617
First swing on it.

01:34:07.617 --> 01:34:10.418
MARISHA: Take it, take it.
SAM: ♪ Take that first tip. ♪

01:34:10.418 --> 01:34:11.638
ASHLEY: 23.

01:34:11.638 --> 01:34:13.138
MATT: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:34:17.138 --> 01:34:18.959
ASHLEY: Savage Attacker.

01:34:18.959 --> 01:34:22.384
Plus eight. Much better.

01:34:22.384 --> 01:34:25.498
TRAVIS: I didn't take any swings on her.

01:34:25.498 --> 01:34:27.018
SAM: Has anyone attacked Avantika?

01:34:27.018 --> 01:34:27.928
TRAVIS: Beau did.

01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:30.558
ASHLEY: 31 points of damage for the first hit.

01:34:30.558 --> 01:34:34.458
MATT: 31. Nice! Second strike carves through.

01:34:34.458 --> 01:34:38.021
You watch now as you chop one of its giant pincer arms off

01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:40.698
and it hits the ground is bleeding out on that side.

01:34:40.698 --> 01:34:41.738
It's looking pretty hurt.

01:34:41.738 --> 01:34:44.148
It's still clutching with its other claw and its tentacles.

01:34:44.148 --> 01:34:47.188
whipping against it and trying to clutter

01:34:47.188 --> 01:34:48.558
past your armor to get to your flesh

01:34:48.558 --> 01:34:49.635
and it's really gross.

01:34:49.635 --> 01:34:52.484
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to take another hit.

01:34:52.484 --> 01:34:53.865
MARISHA: Fjord.

01:34:53.865 --> 01:34:54.698
ASHLEY: 20.

01:34:54.698 --> 01:34:55.531
MATT: 20 hits.

01:34:57.519 --> 01:35:02.098
MARISHA: What if we do a little, like,
shake and bake top of next turn?

01:35:02.098 --> 01:35:05.588
Like, either I give you advantage
or vice versa by assisting.

01:35:05.588 --> 01:35:07.953
ASHLEY: 12 damage points of damage.

01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:09.319
MATT: 12 points of damage?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:35:09.319 --> 01:35:10.968
MATT: Okay.

01:35:10.968 --> 01:35:12.928
MARISHA: She's going to get a turn before then.

01:35:12.928 --> 01:35:14.498
MATT: You carve a second slash into it.

01:35:14.498 --> 01:35:16.168
One of its legs collapses underneath.

01:35:16.168 --> 01:35:18.508
It is limping. It is barely holding on.

01:35:18.508 --> 01:35:19.808
It is on the cusp of death,

01:35:19.808 --> 01:35:22.428
but it's holding on with whatever strength it has left.

01:35:22.428 --> 01:35:26.538
Some sort of unworldly influence has brought these here

01:35:26.538 --> 01:35:28.428
and have given it a stronger will

01:35:28.428 --> 01:35:30.051
than the need to survive.

01:35:31.054 --> 01:35:34.478
ASHLEY: Okay. So then with my bonus action,

01:35:34.478 --> 01:35:36.578
and since I haven't moved,

01:35:36.578 --> 01:35:38.848
can I try to drag him into the spiritual weapon?

01:35:38.848 --> 01:35:39.892
MATT: It would be an action to do that, unfortunately--

01:35:39.892 --> 01:35:41.751
ASHLEY: It will be an action to do that. Okay.

01:35:42.788 --> 01:35:44.788
MATT: But you've done a shitton of damage to this creature,

01:35:44.788 --> 01:35:45.718
you have a single handedly

01:35:45.718 --> 01:35:48.228
brought it from a fairly hefty sack of hit points

01:35:48.228 --> 01:35:51.278
to almost none in a round and a half.

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:52.858
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:35:52.858 --> 01:35:54.981
TRAVIS: That's a big pain in the ass.
ASHLEY: That's all I can do.

01:35:54.981 --> 01:35:55.847
That's all I can do!

01:35:55.847 --> 01:35:57.347
MATT: All right. It's Avantika's turn.

01:35:57.347 --> 01:36:00.248
She starts her round in both of your ranges.

01:36:00.248 --> 01:36:02.078
TALIESIN: Yep, let's roll our damage.

01:36:02.078 --> 01:36:05.698
MATT: Against you, Jester, that is a 20.

01:36:05.698 --> 01:36:08.678
So succeeds and against-- Same roll. 20 from both of you.

01:36:08.678 --> 01:36:11.328
So half damage from both of your spiritual guardians.

01:36:12.508 --> 01:36:14.681
MARISHA: How is she dead and awesome?

01:36:16.068 --> 01:36:18.706
LAURA: 28, so 14 damage from me.
LIAM: She's French.

01:36:20.668 --> 01:36:23.518
TALIESIN: 19.
MATT: Halved to nine.

01:36:23.518 --> 01:36:27.934
TRAVIS: We don't know if she's undead or resurrected.

01:36:27.934 --> 01:36:30.646
LIAM: Is she dead, or is she Jamedi Cosko dead?

01:36:30.646 --> 01:36:31.968
SAM: What if she was always dead?

01:36:31.968 --> 01:36:34.968
MATT: The cold energy that's on her torso,

01:36:34.968 --> 01:36:36.900
shatters and evaporates.

01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:39.058
She's taken enough damage to now

01:36:39.058 --> 01:36:42.205
disengage the Armor of Agathys that protects her.

01:36:42.205 --> 01:36:43.538
LAURA: Great.

01:36:43.538 --> 01:36:48.429
MATT: After she weathers the blows of celestial anger and

01:36:48.429 --> 01:36:51.988
destruction from both of your sources of divinity,

01:36:51.988 --> 01:36:54.361
whether real or illusion.

01:36:55.578 --> 01:36:56.728
LIAM: Helium balloons.

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:58.711
LAURA: Mine are real, okay?

01:36:58.711 --> 01:37:01.819
Mine are super fucking real.
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and--

01:37:02.970 --> 01:37:04.211
It is in her space,

01:37:04.211 --> 01:37:06.808
which means for free, she can grab it.

01:37:06.808 --> 01:37:10.421
So she grabs the orb and puts it in her pocket,

01:37:11.298 --> 01:37:12.588
like in a little side pouch right there.

01:37:12.588 --> 01:37:13.421
She has it.

01:37:14.298 --> 01:37:16.608
And she's looking at you on this moment

01:37:16.608 --> 01:37:19.768
where it seems like the time slows as she's calculating

01:37:19.768 --> 01:37:21.343
in her brain.

01:37:21.343 --> 01:37:22.178
LIAM: Beauregard.

01:37:22.178 --> 01:37:25.369
MATT: And she's going to go ahead and sidestep around Fjord.

01:37:26.619 --> 01:37:28.245
MARISHA: I'm watching her.

01:37:28.245 --> 01:37:30.588
MATT: Over here and back over here.

01:37:30.588 --> 01:37:34.308
MARISHA: She's not leaving my range.
TALIESIN: Two attacks of opportunity.

01:37:34.308 --> 01:37:35.633
SAM: No.
MARISHA: Has she left my range?

01:37:35.633 --> 01:37:36.936
SAM: She hasn't left his range.

01:37:36.936 --> 01:37:38.281
TRAVIS: She left Beau's.

01:37:38.281 --> 01:37:41.071
MATT: From both Veth--

01:37:41.978 --> 01:37:44.098
which, actually, she can, as a bonus action, disengage.

01:37:44.098 --> 01:37:47.491
So she will, which ignores your attack of opportunity.

01:37:48.341 --> 01:37:49.898
MARISHA: But me.

01:37:49.898 --> 01:37:50.918
LIAM: Sentinel does not--

01:37:50.918 --> 01:37:52.478
MATT: But Sentinel, I believe--

01:37:52.478 --> 01:37:54.068
MARISHA: Ignores disengage.

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:54.901
MATT: I believe so.

01:37:56.848 --> 01:37:58.295
So go for it. Make a strike.

01:37:58.295 --> 01:37:59.328
LAURA: C'mon, Beau!

01:37:59.328 --> 01:38:01.028
LIAM: Punch her in the skull.

01:38:01.028 --> 01:38:03.936
MARISHA: Oh jeez louise!

01:38:03.936 --> 01:38:07.035
Oh my god!
TRAVIS: ♪ Let the sun shine! ♪

01:38:07.035 --> 01:38:09.130
LIAM: I believe.
TRAVIS: ♪ Let ♪

01:38:09.130 --> 01:38:11.303
MARISHA: Ooh, it's not good! 15.

01:38:11.303 --> 01:38:12.136
MATT: 15 misses.

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:13.594
(groaning)

01:38:13.594 --> 01:38:16.278
MARISHA: I rolled real bad.

01:38:16.278 --> 01:38:17.618
MATT: So in a blur,

01:38:17.618 --> 01:38:20.788
you swing with the staff and meet nothing but cold air.

01:38:20.788 --> 01:38:23.438
And then you see this dart as shadow shifts

01:38:23.438 --> 01:38:25.028
around and within an instant,

01:38:25.028 --> 01:38:27.278
you feel the presence of Avantika behind you.

01:38:27.278 --> 01:38:29.778
Now she's there, her eyes flash with a yellowish,

01:38:29.778 --> 01:38:32.118
a familiar yellowish power.
LIAM: Oh shit.

01:38:32.118 --> 01:38:35.885
She goes, "It's a pleasure to see you all again.

01:38:35.885 --> 01:38:37.838
"It's a shame it has to end so soon."

01:38:37.838 --> 01:38:39.218
As she stomps her foot on the ground,

01:38:39.218 --> 01:38:41.128
she's going to cast Thunderwave at level five.

01:38:41.128 --> 01:38:42.438
MARISHA: Wait, what who?

01:38:42.438 --> 01:38:43.388
LIAM: Thunderwaving you.

01:38:44.578 --> 01:38:45.798
Whoa.

01:38:45.798 --> 01:38:48.525
TALIESIN: How much of her movement did she just use

01:38:48.525 --> 01:38:50.278
in being in rough terrain, by the way?

01:38:50.278 --> 01:38:51.487
MATT: 10.

01:38:51.487 --> 01:38:53.712
SAM: Oh boy. She's going to knock us all overboard.

01:38:53.712 --> 01:38:54.970
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Counterspell.

01:38:54.970 --> 01:38:56.312
MARISHA: Yeah, do--
SAM: Oh!

01:38:56.312 --> 01:38:57.318
LIAM: I'm a dinosaur.

01:38:57.318 --> 01:38:59.068
Oh, you are not a dinosaur!
TRAVIS: I'm not.

01:38:59.068 --> 01:39:00.285
LIAM: Yes!

01:39:00.285 --> 01:39:02.328
TRAVIS: It's my last 5th-level.

01:39:02.328 --> 01:39:04.408
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20

01:39:04.408 --> 01:39:06.838
and add your spellcasting modifier to it.

01:39:06.838 --> 01:39:08.528
LIAM: At 5th-level. He's still got to roll?

01:39:08.528 --> 01:39:10.348
She wasn't fucking around.

01:39:10.348 --> 01:39:12.651
TRAVIS: Where's my spell casting modifier? Is that my--?

01:39:13.712 --> 01:39:15.040
MATT: It's your charisma.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:15.918
TRAVIS: That's was my charisma, that's okay,

01:39:15.918 --> 01:39:17.118
so just plus five.

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:19.398
LIAM: I don't know how warlocks work.

01:39:19.398 --> 01:39:20.868
LAURA: No!

01:39:20.868 --> 01:39:22.703
MATT: Natural one.

01:39:22.703 --> 01:39:25.735
ALL: No!

01:39:25.735 --> 01:39:28.426
LAURA: Why do the dice hate us tonight?!
LIAM: That was Sentinel punch

01:39:28.426 --> 01:39:29.709
and the Counterspell!

01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:31.481
MARISHA: I rolled a three.

01:39:32.618 --> 01:39:34.485
LAURA: The dice really like Avantika.

01:39:34.485 --> 01:39:36.117
LIAM: Yeah.

01:39:36.117 --> 01:39:37.596
Wah wah wah wah wah.

01:39:37.596 --> 01:39:39.646
MATT: Okay. I need--

01:39:41.038 --> 01:39:42.058
LIAM: Oh man.

01:39:42.058 --> 01:39:44.408
MATT: I need Beauregard, Fjord, and Veth

01:39:44.408 --> 01:39:47.441
to all make constitution saving throw us for me, please.

01:39:48.868 --> 01:39:51.268
LIAM: This is the best.

01:39:51.268 --> 01:39:52.228
I'm so glad you rolled a one.

01:39:52.228 --> 01:39:55.481
MARISHA: All right. Well, I wish
that would have happened sooner.

01:39:56.426 --> 01:39:57.559
TRAVIS: New dice.

01:39:57.559 --> 01:39:59.300
No, I'm going to give you a chance for redemption.

01:40:03.694 --> 01:40:04.698
18.

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:05.838
SAM: Ooh.

01:40:05.838 --> 01:40:06.898
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw?

01:40:06.898 --> 01:40:08.014
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: 18.

01:40:08.014 --> 01:40:08.964
MATT: 18.

01:40:08.964 --> 01:40:10.448
MARISHA: 21.
SAM: Oh!

01:40:10.448 --> 01:40:13.158
I also rolled well. 16.

01:40:13.158 --> 01:40:14.061
MATT: 16...

01:40:16.518 --> 01:40:18.094
16 does not succeed.
SAM: Damn!

01:40:19.478 --> 01:40:22.365
I'm going to go over.
MATT: But the other ones do.

01:40:35.488 --> 01:40:37.413
32 points of thunder damage to you.

01:40:37.413 --> 01:40:38.308
SAM: Sure.

01:40:38.308 --> 01:40:40.942
MATT: Both of you take 16 points of thunder damage.

01:40:40.942 --> 01:40:42.800
Veth is thrown overboard.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.238
LIAM: Whoa.
SAM: Area.

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:45.183
Wait. Can I take--?

01:40:45.183 --> 01:40:46.444
TALIESIN: You have Water Walk.
LAURA: Yeah!

01:40:46.444 --> 01:40:49.967
SAM: Can I take-- not Uncanny Dodge, what was the other one?

01:40:49.967 --> 01:40:51.267
Evasion?

01:40:51.267 --> 01:40:52.958
MATT: You didn't succeed on your save, though.

01:40:53.828 --> 01:40:54.661
SAM: Totally right.

01:40:54.661 --> 01:40:56.638
MATT: And it wasn't a dexterity.

01:40:56.638 --> 01:40:57.471
MARISHA: I did, though.

01:40:57.471 --> 01:40:58.608
LIAM: Evasion is just dex.

01:40:58.608 --> 01:41:01.321
MARISHA: Evasion, I always forget I have that as a monk.

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:03.008
MATT: It's not a dex save, though.

01:41:03.008 --> 01:41:04.548
MARISHA: It's not a dex save.

01:41:04.548 --> 01:41:06.265
I'll take that damage happily.

01:41:06.265 --> 01:41:07.868
MATT: There you go.

01:41:07.868 --> 01:41:10.078
You plummet off and begin to fall.

01:41:10.078 --> 01:41:12.258
You do have your ring of water walking.

01:41:12.258 --> 01:41:15.016
TALIESIN: Everyone still has Water Walk cast on them.
MATT: So you fall 20 feet

01:41:15.016 --> 01:41:18.108
and impact hard on the water below.

01:41:18.108 --> 01:41:20.358
To take nine points of bludgeoning damage,

01:41:20.358 --> 01:41:23.583
hitting the icy surface of the ocean below.

01:41:23.583 --> 01:41:25.580
LIAM: Bellyflop damage.

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.680
TALIESIN: Ow.
SAM: Am I prone or on my feet?

01:41:29.058 --> 01:41:31.638
TRAVIS: There was no reason we
should have had temporary hit points, right?

01:41:31.638 --> 01:41:33.048
MARISHA: We did have temporary hit points

01:41:33.048 --> 01:41:35.938
from having tea with Vess DeRogna, I believe.

01:41:35.938 --> 01:41:36.771
SAM: That was days ago.

01:41:36.771 --> 01:41:37.818
MATT: That was a long time ago.

01:41:37.818 --> 01:41:39.259
MARISHA: But don't they stay until you use them?

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:40.492
MATT: Until your next long rest.

01:41:40.492 --> 01:41:43.708
SAM: Matthew, am I prone or standing?

01:41:43.708 --> 01:41:45.718
MATT: You are standing.

01:41:45.718 --> 01:41:47.611
I'll say. 20 feet you land.

01:41:48.518 --> 01:41:49.351
You know what?

01:41:49.351 --> 01:41:50.389
Make an acrobatics check for me to see

01:41:50.389 --> 01:41:52.589
if you can land on your feet.

01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:54.497
SAM: Check?
MATT: Yeah. Acrobatics.

01:41:54.497 --> 01:41:56.838
SAM: Oh, I get Reliable Talent.

01:41:56.838 --> 01:41:57.828
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine.
SAM: 20.

01:41:57.828 --> 01:41:59.662
MATT: Yeah. You're on your feet. You're fine.

01:42:01.044 --> 01:42:04.552
That'll be a Avantika's action on that.

01:42:04.552 --> 01:42:06.783
Cast that spell there.

01:42:06.783 --> 01:42:09.938
TRAVIS: Does Thunderwave count as an attack roll?

01:42:09.938 --> 01:42:11.438
It doesn't, right?

01:42:11.438 --> 01:42:12.478
SAM: Sure.

01:42:12.478 --> 01:42:14.469
MATT: It does-- Thunderwave? No, it is not an attack roll.

01:42:14.469 --> 01:42:15.323
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:42:15.323 --> 01:42:18.388
MATT: Okay. So that finishes Avantika's turn.

01:42:18.388 --> 01:42:22.768
Now this creature here is going to appear behind--

01:42:22.768 --> 01:42:25.101
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, real quick, where did Avantika go?

01:42:25.101 --> 01:42:26.948
MATT: She's behind you. Right there.

01:42:26.948 --> 01:42:28.218
LIAM: She's between you and the ballista.

01:42:28.218 --> 01:42:30.078
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: Correct.

01:42:30.078 --> 01:42:31.858
TALIESIN: That creature has entered both of our--

01:42:31.858 --> 01:42:34.568
had started its turn in
both of our fields and has half speed.

01:42:34.568 --> 01:42:38.478
MATT: Indeed. It barely moved, but it does take

01:42:38.478 --> 01:42:39.358
two saves from both of you.

01:42:39.358 --> 01:42:41.568
So go ahead and roll damage.

01:42:41.568 --> 01:42:43.158
LAURA: Roll damage?

01:42:43.158 --> 01:42:44.825
MATT: Fail on both. So full damage from both of you

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:45.833
for your spiritual guardians.

01:42:45.833 --> 01:42:46.666
LAURA: Oh!

01:42:51.298 --> 01:42:52.131
TALIESIN: 22.

01:42:53.387 --> 01:42:56.115
LAURA: 26.
MATT: That fell.

01:42:56.115 --> 01:42:57.688
22?
TALIESIN: 22 radiant.

01:42:57.688 --> 01:42:59.662
MARISHA: So she's still base to base with you, Fjord?

01:42:59.662 --> 01:43:00.548
LAURA: 26.

01:43:00.548 --> 01:43:02.792
MATT: 26, oof!

01:43:02.792 --> 01:43:05.226
That thing's looking hurt!

01:43:05.226 --> 01:43:07.442
It rushes in and gets blasted

01:43:07.442 --> 01:43:11.025
with both of these waves of energy and is like (gurgling).

01:43:11.025 --> 01:43:11.858
Angry.

01:43:11.858 --> 01:43:16.204
It's going to go ahead and take two swipes at you, Jester,

01:43:16.204 --> 01:43:18.279
and then one at you, Caduceus.

01:43:19.208 --> 01:43:20.724
That is 17.

01:43:20.724 --> 01:43:21.590
LAURA: Ooh, it misses!

01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:23.415
MATT: Misses!

01:43:23.415 --> 01:43:24.363
19.

01:43:24.363 --> 01:43:25.891
LAURA: 19.

01:43:26.832 --> 01:43:30.438
MATT: You suffer 14 points of slashing damage,

01:43:30.438 --> 01:43:31.865
and then go ahead and make a constitution saving throw

01:43:31.865 --> 01:43:33.764
to maintain concentration.

01:43:33.764 --> 01:43:35.321
And then a strike against you.

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.305
That is going to be 20.

01:43:38.305 --> 01:43:39.138
TALIESIN: Hits.

01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:41.284
MATT: You take-- Ooh.

01:43:41.284 --> 01:43:44.017
That is going to be 16 points
of slashing damage against you,

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:45.333
and also make constitution saving throw.

01:43:45.333 --> 01:43:46.518
LAURA: 14 constitution save?

01:43:46.518 --> 01:43:47.908
MATT: You're fine.
LAURA: Okay.

01:43:47.908 --> 01:43:49.308
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw?
MATT: Yep.

01:43:50.898 --> 01:43:53.578
TALIESIN: Oof. Nope, that's a five.

01:43:53.578 --> 01:43:55.851
MATT: Five? You lose concentration--

01:43:55.851 --> 01:43:58.108
TALIESIN: Oh, wait! I have advantage on those rolls!

01:43:58.108 --> 01:43:59.068
MATT: You do you if you have War Caster.

01:43:59.068 --> 01:44:00.493
TALIESIN: I do.
MATT: So roll again.

01:44:01.376 --> 01:44:02.209
TALIESIN: Aha!

01:44:03.438 --> 01:44:04.298
17!

01:44:04.298 --> 01:44:06.008
MATT: 17, that succeeds.
TALIESIN: Yay! Never mind.

01:44:06.008 --> 01:44:08.868
MATT: And then it teleports beyond the range,

01:44:08.868 --> 01:44:10.568
back to where it started over here.

01:44:11.508 --> 01:44:12.938
Freaking out that one crew member over there

01:44:12.938 --> 01:44:14.550
who was back to the wall. (yells)

01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:16.153
LAURA: I have War Caster!
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:44:16.153 --> 01:44:18.744
MATT: Yeah, that's how you have
advantage on these each time.

01:44:18.744 --> 01:44:20.848
LAURA: Oh. I haven't been rolling with advantage.

01:44:20.848 --> 01:44:22.477
MATT: Well, you should be doing that from now on.

01:44:22.477 --> 01:44:26.101
MARISHA: Best part of War Caster, dude. Hell yeah.

01:44:26.101 --> 01:44:27.298
MATT: That finishes its go,

01:44:27.298 --> 01:44:28.694
and now the two creatures are going to go.

01:44:28.694 --> 01:44:30.514
The one that's barely limping along is going to go ahead

01:44:30.514 --> 01:44:33.908
and attempt to crush you, Yasha, within its claws.

01:44:33.908 --> 01:44:36.393
Natural one, no issue.

01:44:37.518 --> 01:44:39.648
That is a 16 to hit.

01:44:39.648 --> 01:44:41.089
ASHLEY: It does not hit.
MATT: It does not hit.

01:44:41.089 --> 01:44:42.147
It is trying to crush you,

01:44:42.147 --> 01:44:43.908
but it just has no strength left in its body.

01:44:43.908 --> 01:44:45.498
It's so close to death's door

01:44:45.498 --> 01:44:46.828
as it's squeezing and squeezing you,

01:44:46.828 --> 01:44:48.228
you're just shaking your head

01:44:48.228 --> 01:44:49.828
how pitiful this creature is.

01:44:49.828 --> 01:44:50.935
This guy over here,

01:44:50.935 --> 01:44:52.558
he's going to go ahead and take the same damage

01:44:52.558 --> 01:44:55.433
that you guys just dealt, which would be...

01:44:57.199 --> 01:44:58.440
22 and 26.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.831
LAURA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:44:59.831 --> 01:45:02.364
MATT: Succeeds, so this guy--

01:45:02.364 --> 01:45:03.414
LAURA: Is 13.

01:45:03.414 --> 01:45:06.589
MATT: Is 13. And...

01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:09.418
Fails. 26.

01:45:09.418 --> 01:45:12.868
LAURA: Wait, does that mean I can use my reaction

01:45:12.868 --> 01:45:14.518
against the frog guy?

01:45:14.518 --> 01:45:16.058
Did he already die?

01:45:16.058 --> 01:45:17.900
MATT: No, he's not died, he teleported away.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.190
LAURA: Oh. Could I have used my reaction when he hit me?

01:45:20.190 --> 01:45:22.338
MATT: To?
LAURA: To attack him,

01:45:22.338 --> 01:45:25.305
since I-- with a spell, since that's War Caster.

01:45:26.778 --> 01:45:28.828
MATT: He didn't move out of your range, he teleported,

01:45:28.828 --> 01:45:30.745
which is different from moving out of your range.

01:45:30.745 --> 01:45:32.145
LAURA: But it's not if somebody moves

01:45:32.145 --> 01:45:34.678
out of my range, it's if somebody attacks me.

01:45:34.678 --> 01:45:35.648
MATT: Oh, for War Caster?

01:45:35.648 --> 01:45:36.915
LAURA: Isn't it?
MATT: I thought was--

01:45:36.915 --> 01:45:39.415
LAURA: No, it's to use a reaction to spell them--

01:45:39.415 --> 01:45:41.038
MATT: Yeah. For War Caster, it's if somebody is moving

01:45:41.038 --> 01:45:41.998
out of your melee range,

01:45:41.998 --> 01:45:43.318
where normally you'd get an attack of opportunity,

01:45:43.318 --> 01:45:46.738
you can cast a spell as a reaction to them.

01:45:46.738 --> 01:45:48.338
LAURA: I understand. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:45:48.338 --> 01:45:50.228
MATT: No worries, but this guy
just teleports as part of his.

01:45:50.228 --> 01:45:51.906
LAURA: An opportunity attack.
LIAM: It's great because it lets you cast

01:45:51.906 --> 01:45:54.158
an entirely additional spell in a around.

01:45:54.158 --> 01:45:55.218
MATT: Exactly.

01:45:55.218 --> 01:45:56.176
LAURA: That's killer.
MATT: Really good.

01:45:56.176 --> 01:45:57.421
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:45:57.421 --> 01:45:58.263
MATT: All right.

01:45:58.263 --> 01:45:59.679
So this guy, after taking a lot of damage,

01:45:59.679 --> 01:46:02.158
is going to go ahead and shift into range here,

01:46:02.158 --> 01:46:04.528
angry and furious that he's just being hurt.

01:46:04.528 --> 01:46:05.628
TALIESIN: Half-speed as well.

01:46:05.628 --> 01:46:07.274
MATT: I know. He only had to move 10 feet.

01:46:07.274 --> 01:46:08.358
No, it's all good, man.

01:46:08.358 --> 01:46:10.198
I need my Clippy. It's good.

01:46:10.198 --> 01:46:11.348
I got too much concentrate on as a DM.

01:46:11.348 --> 01:46:12.727
You guys got to remind me what your spells do.

01:46:12.727 --> 01:46:15.908
LIAM: Was that crab creature within 10 feet of my ass?

01:46:15.908 --> 01:46:17.578
Now, I'm not where I am on the map.

01:46:17.578 --> 01:46:18.988
I was between the steps.

01:46:18.988 --> 01:46:20.628
MATT: For this, at this point, no,

01:46:20.628 --> 01:46:23.521
because he moved past him and went up to where you were.

01:46:25.793 --> 01:46:28.258
MARISHA: I love the sentences that D&amp;D breeds.

01:46:28.258 --> 01:46:29.158
TALIESIN: It's so amazing.

01:46:29.158 --> 01:46:29.991
No one has ever said that before.

01:46:29.991 --> 01:46:32.982
LIAM: I had asked to get between the stairs to look down.

01:46:32.982 --> 01:46:34.808
You put me up there just because of the balance.

01:46:34.808 --> 01:46:36.252
MATT: You know what? I would say, yes. It's within range.

01:46:36.252 --> 01:46:37.566
LIAM: Then I'm going to tail that motherfucker--

01:46:37.566 --> 01:46:38.749
MATT: Go for it.

01:46:38.749 --> 01:46:39.582
TALIESIN: Bless you.

01:46:40.518 --> 01:46:42.218
LIAM: That is a 29 to hit.

01:46:42.218 --> 01:46:43.688
MATT: That's definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage

01:46:43.688 --> 01:46:45.163
with your tyrannosaurus tail.

01:46:45.163 --> 01:46:47.463
LIAM: (gurgling)

01:46:47.463 --> 01:46:49.513
17 points of bludgeoning damage for him.

01:46:49.513 --> 01:46:51.071
MATT: 17 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:46:52.498 --> 01:46:54.598
Ooh, he's looking rough.

01:46:54.598 --> 01:46:57.678
He's angrily going to go in there and strike at both,

01:46:57.678 --> 01:46:59.470
his two claw strikes one against each of you

01:46:59.470 --> 01:47:01.948
as he's trying to grab both of you who are holding onto

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:06.168
these blasting, horribly painful radiuses

01:47:06.168 --> 01:47:07.208
of celestial anger.

01:47:07.208 --> 01:47:08.366
They're just bearing down on it

01:47:08.366 --> 01:47:09.758
and everything in the vicinity.

01:47:09.758 --> 01:47:12.083
Against Caduceus, that is going to be a 22 to hit.

01:47:12.083 --> 01:47:12.916
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

01:47:12.916 --> 01:47:15.607
MATT: And against Jester, that is going to be 21 to hit.

01:47:15.607 --> 01:47:16.840
LAURA: (scoffs unhappily)

01:47:18.018 --> 01:47:18.851
MATT: So.

01:47:19.776 --> 01:47:21.308
Ooh, max damage on that one.

01:47:21.308 --> 01:47:25.082
That is 16 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Caduceus.

01:47:26.024 --> 01:47:28.593
And 14 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Jester,

01:47:28.593 --> 01:47:30.136
and you are both grappled.

01:47:30.136 --> 01:47:31.528
TALIESIN: Cool.
LAURA: Nice.

01:47:31.528 --> 01:47:34.298
MATT: And we will say the tentacles begin to

01:47:34.298 --> 01:47:36.160
wrap out of it.

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.010
Caduceus, go ahead and make
a constitution saving for me, please.

01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:38.843
LIAM: Uh oh.

01:47:40.713 --> 01:47:43.189
TALIESIN: It's better than last time.

01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:44.268
SAM: Hey, it's the Olympics again!

01:47:44.268 --> 01:47:45.498
TALIESIN: 11.

01:47:45.498 --> 01:47:48.941
MATT: 11, you are poisoned and paralyzed.

01:47:50.908 --> 01:47:52.191
SAM: Who's poisoned and paralyzed?

01:47:52.191 --> 01:47:53.407
LAURA: Caduceus!

01:47:53.407 --> 01:47:55.478
SAM: Oh no, he's going to get a new one,

01:47:55.478 --> 01:47:57.908
a new player character. Oh god!

01:47:57.908 --> 01:47:59.518
MATT: So you feel the tentacles begin

01:47:59.518 --> 01:48:01.228
to affix to elements of your armor

01:48:01.228 --> 01:48:02.838
and squeeze past. As it hits you,

01:48:02.838 --> 01:48:06.103
your entire musculature begins to pulse and tighten.

01:48:06.103 --> 01:48:07.788
Your eyeballs begin to bulge

01:48:07.788 --> 01:48:08.621
and you feel like they're about to

01:48:08.621 --> 01:48:10.738
pop out of your head and you're locked up.

01:48:10.738 --> 01:48:13.052
Your entire body is locked in place.

01:48:13.052 --> 01:48:16.388
And all you can hear now is that (pulsing)

01:48:16.388 --> 01:48:18.078
throughout your entire body.

01:48:18.078 --> 01:48:19.820
That finishes its turn.

01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:21.248
Veth, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

01:48:21.248 --> 01:48:25.603
LIAM: Yeah, Travis, could your origin story leave us alone?

01:48:25.603 --> 01:48:27.228
SAM: I will use my movement

01:48:27.228 --> 01:48:29.641
to try to climb back up onto the ship.

01:48:31.348 --> 01:48:32.518
MATT: It is a 20-foot climb

01:48:32.518 --> 01:48:35.591
to get to the top because it is a large icebreaker ship.

01:48:37.570 --> 01:48:39.398
I'll say 15 feet, actually.

01:48:39.398 --> 01:48:41.008
You're at half movement to climb.

01:48:41.008 --> 01:48:42.218
Go ahead and roll an athletics check,

01:48:42.218 --> 01:48:43.911
because it is icy and it is slick.

01:48:44.908 --> 01:48:45.778
SAM: Athletics?

01:48:45.778 --> 01:48:47.328
MATT: Yes.

01:48:47.328 --> 01:48:49.388
SAM: 15.
MATT: 15, that'll do it.

01:48:49.388 --> 01:48:51.318
So with half of your movement, which would be 15 feet,

01:48:51.318 --> 01:48:53.348
that'll get you just up onto the deck,

01:48:53.348 --> 01:48:55.814
but that's the end of your movement there.

01:48:55.814 --> 01:48:57.238
SAM: Okay.

01:48:57.238 --> 01:49:02.101
Actually, can I pause before I

01:49:02.101 --> 01:49:05.317
get to the lip of the--

01:49:06.276 --> 01:49:08.317
of the whatever it's called.
MATT: Sure.

01:49:08.317 --> 01:49:09.767
SAM: The edge? The deck?

01:49:09.767 --> 01:49:11.138
MATT: Yeah.

01:49:11.138 --> 01:49:14.688
SAM: And I would-- So I'm just peeking over the deck.

01:49:14.688 --> 01:49:15.628
MATT: You're peeking over.

01:49:15.628 --> 01:49:20.496
SAM: Peeking over the deck. I mean, she doesn't see me--

01:49:20.496 --> 01:49:21.928
MATT: Correct.
SAM: -- but do I need--

01:49:21.928 --> 01:49:23.928
I should try to hide.

01:49:23.928 --> 01:49:24.928
MATT: I would say yes.

01:49:24.928 --> 01:49:27.328
SAM: I will, bonus action, attempt to hide.

01:49:27.328 --> 01:49:28.161
MATT: Go for it.

01:49:32.588 --> 01:49:33.578
SAM: 29.

01:49:33.578 --> 01:49:36.248
MATT: 29, that definitely feels pretty stealthy.

01:49:36.248 --> 01:49:39.088
SAM: And then who has the football right now?

01:49:39.088 --> 01:49:40.878
LAURA: She's got it on her side, hip pocket.

01:49:40.878 --> 01:49:42.091
SAM: It's in her pocket.

01:49:42.938 --> 01:49:45.194
MATT: It seems to be the moment, yeah.

01:49:45.194 --> 01:49:47.448
Is Fjord holding his falchion?

01:49:47.448 --> 01:49:48.289
No.

01:49:48.289 --> 01:49:49.548
TRAVIS: Star Razor, yes.

01:49:49.548 --> 01:49:51.889
MATT: It's not the falchion.
Star Razor is in his hand, yeah.

01:49:51.889 --> 01:49:52.722
SAM: Okay.

01:49:56.388 --> 01:49:58.538
I will, from my hiding position,

01:49:58.538 --> 01:50:03.538
I'll cast Phantasmal whatever on her.

01:50:04.088 --> 01:50:05.165
MATT: Phantasmal whatever?

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:06.418
SAM: Phantasmal Force.

01:50:06.418 --> 01:50:07.818
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

01:50:07.818 --> 01:50:11.378
SAM: It is just a DC intelligence 16,

01:50:11.378 --> 01:50:14.518
but at disadvantage because I'm hidden.

01:50:14.518 --> 01:50:15.859
MATT: Intelligence.

01:50:18.001 --> 01:50:19.367
She rolled really well on that first one,

01:50:19.367 --> 01:50:20.511
but it's at disadvantage.

01:50:21.938 --> 01:50:24.996
That is a 17 total.
SAM: Damn it!

01:50:24.996 --> 01:50:26.721
MATT: Rolled a 19 and a 16.

01:50:26.721 --> 01:50:28.497
I'm sorry. She only has a plus one on it.

01:50:28.497 --> 01:50:30.088
SAM: Damn it.

01:50:30.088 --> 01:50:30.958
MATT: That's a good try, though.

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:32.878
LAURA: What is that? A charisma or?

01:50:32.878 --> 01:50:35.003
SAM: It's intelligence 16.

01:50:35.003 --> 01:50:36.036
Damn it.

01:50:36.036 --> 01:50:38.577
MATT: It was a good choice, but no effect, unfortunately.

01:50:38.577 --> 01:50:39.410
SAM: Okay.

01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:40.828
MATT: That finish your turn? All right.

01:50:40.828 --> 01:50:42.528
Caleb, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.

01:50:44.243 --> 01:50:47.743
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to say that I use

01:50:47.743 --> 01:50:49.028
all of or a lot of my movement

01:50:49.028 --> 01:50:51.398
to get actually where the miniature is,

01:50:51.398 --> 01:50:52.608
because he was between the steps,

01:50:52.608 --> 01:50:56.038
but I'm just going to, like, crush stairs and heave myself

01:50:56.038 --> 01:50:57.704
up there--
MATT: To get to where? Up on--

01:50:57.704 --> 01:50:59.601
LIAM: To where he is, you don't even have to move him

01:50:59.601 --> 01:51:00.718
because where he actually is,

01:51:00.718 --> 01:51:03.578
is between the stairs on the lower deck

01:51:03.578 --> 01:51:05.203
We just put him there for balance,

01:51:05.203 --> 01:51:07.468
but now he is right where he is.

01:51:07.468 --> 01:51:08.890
I climbed up.

01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:11.199
Actually, let's circle him a bit.

01:51:11.199 --> 01:51:12.498
Make your life easier.

01:51:12.498 --> 01:51:13.331
Yeah, right there.

01:51:13.331 --> 01:51:14.468
MATT: There you go, look at that,

01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:15.301
look at that.

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:16.448
LIAM: Then I'm going to eat him for a snack.

01:51:16.448 --> 01:51:18.898
MATT: Go for it. (laughs)

01:51:18.898 --> 01:51:20.846
LIAM: That is an 18 to hit.

01:51:20.846 --> 01:51:22.838
MATT: That indeed does hit!

01:51:23.888 --> 01:51:25.608
LIAM: He is grappled in my mouth.

01:51:25.608 --> 01:51:28.961
MATT: Oh god, that's terrifying.
LIAM: He takes.

01:51:30.218 --> 01:51:32.128
MATT: Imagine how terrifying it would be to be a creature

01:51:32.128 --> 01:51:36.548
of the sea to suddenly to, One: Learn what a T-rex is,

01:51:36.548 --> 01:51:39.313
and then have it bite you and hold you in its mouth.

01:51:39.313 --> 01:51:41.528
LIAM: 28 points of piercing damage

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:42.556
and he is grappled grappled in my mouth.

01:51:42.556 --> 01:51:43.872
MATT: He is grappled. He cannot move,

01:51:43.872 --> 01:51:46.728
and he is stuck there in your jaws.

01:51:46.728 --> 01:51:49.068
We'll say, for the purposes of this,

01:51:49.068 --> 01:51:50.968
I have another one here and just go.

01:51:50.968 --> 01:51:52.534
LIAM: Ahh!
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:51:52.534 --> 01:51:55.692
MATT: (yelling)

01:51:55.692 --> 01:51:56.867
(yells)

01:51:57.753 --> 01:51:58.586
Perfect.
TALIESIN: This is both

01:51:58.586 --> 01:52:01.014
threatening and unbelievably silly at the same time.

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:02.131
MATT: It's the best kind.
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

01:52:02.131 --> 01:52:03.658
LIAM: I would like to think that the entire ship has

01:52:03.658 --> 01:52:05.827
went (creaking) in the water.

01:52:05.827 --> 01:52:07.111
MATT: It's a pretty big ship.

01:52:07.111 --> 01:52:10.610
It's pretty big ship, I'll say it's a slight tilt.

01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:11.997
Okay, that finishes your go?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:52:11.997 --> 01:52:14.316
MATT: All right. Jester, you're up.
Caduceus, you're on deck.

01:52:14.316 --> 01:52:17.516
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action to

01:52:17.516 --> 01:52:20.874
attack the lobster that's fighting Yasha.

01:52:20.874 --> 01:52:22.719
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Get it.

01:52:25.557 --> 01:52:26.938
LAURA: 26!

01:52:26.938 --> 01:52:29.651
MATT: 26, that definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:52:33.028 --> 01:52:34.268
LAURA: 16 points.

01:52:34.268 --> 01:52:36.226
MATT: 16 points.
LAURA: Of serrated lollipop damage!

01:52:36.226 --> 01:52:40.210
MATT: As the lollipop swings over in a wide buzzsaw arc,

01:52:40.210 --> 01:52:42.408
hits the-- You see sparks flying off

01:52:42.408 --> 01:52:43.838
as it hits the outside of the shell.

01:52:43.838 --> 01:52:47.189
Then, like cutting through chain,

01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:50.538
it goes through and its body just folds in two halves.

01:52:50.538 --> 01:52:52.630
In this wet smack sound.
LIAM: That was candy chips.

01:52:52.630 --> 01:52:55.098
MATT: You watch as the gore splatters

01:52:55.098 --> 01:52:57.468
and immediately begins to crystallize into ice.

01:52:57.468 --> 01:53:00.134
It is destroyed and Yasha is no longer grappled.

01:53:00.134 --> 01:53:01.501
LAURA, SAM, and ASHLEY: Yay.

01:53:03.768 --> 01:53:05.035
SAM: Freedom.

01:53:05.035 --> 01:53:06.184
MATT: All righty.

01:53:06.184 --> 01:53:07.850
LAURA: Can I move?
MATT: That's your bonus action.

01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:08.698
LAURA: Yes, can I use the

01:53:08.698 --> 01:53:11.408
rest of the spiritual weapon movement to move it?

01:53:11.408 --> 01:53:12.478
Or does it have to--?

01:53:12.478 --> 01:53:14.488
MATT: It's usually move 20 feet and then attack.

01:53:14.488 --> 01:53:15.504
I'll let you move it. Sure, why not.

01:53:15.504 --> 01:53:17.508
LAURA: Move 20 feet towards us.

01:53:17.508 --> 01:53:20.571
MARISHA: She's in between Fjord and the ballista.

01:53:22.908 --> 01:53:25.178
LAURA: It's basically a T-rex. It just won't hold still.

01:53:25.178 --> 01:53:26.953
MATT: It just won't hold still. That's fine.

01:53:28.025 --> 01:53:30.508
LAURA: And then I'm going to go super--

01:53:30.508 --> 01:53:31.798
This is probably not going to work,

01:53:31.798 --> 01:53:33.348
but I'm going to give it a try.

01:53:34.328 --> 01:53:35.645
MATT: What you doing?

01:53:35.645 --> 01:53:40.288
LAURA: I'm going to try to...

01:53:40.288 --> 01:53:41.128
SAM: Commune.

01:53:42.948 --> 01:53:45.892
LAURA: Dominate Person.

01:53:45.892 --> 01:53:47.458
MATT: To?
LAURA: Avantika.

01:53:47.458 --> 01:53:48.466
MATT: Avantika...

01:53:48.466 --> 01:53:51.207
is going to cast Counterspell.

01:53:51.207 --> 01:53:52.207
LAURA: Okay.

01:53:53.898 --> 01:53:55.218
I cast it at 6th-level.

01:53:55.218 --> 01:53:56.508
MATT: You have to say before.

01:53:56.508 --> 01:53:58.548
LAURA: I only-- it's a 5th-level spell.
I'm out of 5th-levels.

01:53:58.548 --> 01:54:00.448
So I only could cast it at 6th-level.

01:54:02.467 --> 01:54:05.193
I didn't know that, you know what I mean?

01:54:05.193 --> 01:54:07.038
MATT: That's fine. She casts everything at 5th-level.

01:54:07.038 --> 01:54:08.638
So she does still have to roll for it.

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:13.051
Natural 18 plus four.

01:54:13.978 --> 01:54:15.848
Unfortunately. It was a good shot, but

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:16.858
unfortunately she does.

01:54:16.858 --> 01:54:18.128
LAURA: I knew it was a high risk,

01:54:18.128 --> 01:54:20.028
but I thought it could be cool if it worked.

01:54:20.028 --> 01:54:21.977
SAM: Yes, it would've been very cool.

01:54:21.977 --> 01:54:23.777
ASHLEY: It was a cool idea.
SAM: It would also be very cool

01:54:23.777 --> 01:54:25.988
if any of my shit worked all night.

01:54:25.988 --> 01:54:27.568
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Any of us!

01:54:27.568 --> 01:54:30.430
MATT: Yeah. Yeah. It's been a little tough.
MARISHA: Bad rolls, bad rolls.

01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:32.748
LAURA: I'm still grappled. Cool.
MATT: Yeah.

01:54:33.523 --> 01:54:34.713
MATT: Okay, does that finish your go?

01:54:34.713 --> 01:54:35.546
LAURA: Yeah, that's all I got.

01:54:35.546 --> 01:54:38.142
MATT: Sorry. All right, Caduceus, you're up.

01:54:38.142 --> 01:54:41.887
TALIESIN: I am paralyzed, so I'm just...

01:54:41.887 --> 01:54:43.889
I can't really do anything, can I?

01:54:43.889 --> 01:54:45.064
I have no roll against this?

01:54:45.064 --> 01:54:45.997
MATT: No, at the end of your turn,

01:54:45.997 --> 01:54:47.631
you can make another constitution saving throw.

01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:49.314
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, well, I'll make another

01:54:49.314 --> 01:54:51.096
constitution saving throw.
MATT: Indeed.

01:54:51.096 --> 01:54:52.723
SAM: You can go to your mind palace.

01:54:54.773 --> 01:54:55.606
TALIESIN: Come on.

01:54:55.606 --> 01:54:56.894
Oh!

01:54:56.894 --> 01:54:57.727
20.

01:54:57.727 --> 01:55:00.318
MATT: 20, you are no longer poisoned and paralyzed.

01:55:00.318 --> 01:55:01.593
SAM: Oh, whoa.

01:55:01.593 --> 01:55:02.830
MATT: But you are still grappled.

01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:03.913
LIAM: Clean living.

01:55:03.913 --> 01:55:05.146
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:55:05.146 --> 01:55:07.559
MATT: What you did there was prevent auto-crits against you

01:55:07.559 --> 01:55:09.188
from the creature.
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:55:09.188 --> 01:55:11.094
And my ring is still up, so that's nice.

01:55:11.094 --> 01:55:11.927
MATT: Yep.

01:55:16.244 --> 01:55:18.781
Actually, interesting point of order.

01:55:18.781 --> 01:55:19.739
Let me see here.

01:55:19.739 --> 01:55:21.107
TALIESIN: It doesn't break concentration.

01:55:21.107 --> 01:55:22.233
MATT: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

01:55:22.233 --> 01:55:23.491
TALIESIN: It doesn't. I looked it up.

01:55:23.491 --> 01:55:25.335
MATT: You did? All right, then, I trust you.
LIAM: I remember at the end of the last game, I was like:

01:55:25.335 --> 01:55:27.894
Come on, why aren't we doing this now?

01:55:27.894 --> 01:55:29.235
TALIESIN: I'm going to check. Now you're freaking me out.

01:55:29.235 --> 01:55:30.901
LIAM: Four hours.
MATT: Yeah.

01:55:30.901 --> 01:55:32.668
Battle at this level with this many players,

01:55:32.668 --> 01:55:33.934
it's going to take a chunk of time.

01:55:33.934 --> 01:55:36.392
Especially any worthwhile battle.

01:55:36.392 --> 01:55:38.098
All right, so that finishes your go, Caduceus.

01:55:38.098 --> 01:55:38.947
TALIESIN: Yep. No, I'm good.

01:55:38.947 --> 01:55:40.723
MATT: This person's going to go ahead and attempt to

01:55:40.723 --> 01:55:43.575
situate this ballista with their action.

01:55:43.575 --> 01:55:45.957
This guy over here is going to-- now that one is--

01:55:45.957 --> 01:55:47.218
now that he can see and the fog is gone,

01:55:47.218 --> 01:55:49.484
he's going to go ahead and rotate it,

01:55:49.484 --> 01:55:54.468
and attempt to point blank fire at the creature right here.

01:55:56.367 --> 01:55:57.545
So he's actually probably going to move along

01:55:57.545 --> 01:55:59.211
with the back of it. He's going to swing over the edge,

01:55:59.211 --> 01:56:00.503
grab the edge of the ballista

01:56:00.503 --> 01:56:03.023
and kick off, and off the edge of the ship,

01:56:03.023 --> 01:56:05.974
to turn the opposite side and then as the aims it up,

01:56:05.974 --> 01:56:07.946
fire towards the creature that has

01:56:07.946 --> 01:56:09.543
both of our clerics grappled.

01:56:09.543 --> 01:56:11.495
LIAM: Good job, Ted.

01:56:11.495 --> 01:56:13.112
MATT: That is going to be a...

01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:15.496
It just hits with a 16.

01:56:15.496 --> 01:56:16.815
LAURA: Yes!

01:56:16.815 --> 01:56:18.647
Save us, Ted!

01:56:18.647 --> 01:56:21.993
MATT: With that, this does...

01:56:21.993 --> 01:56:25.834
All right, so that is 4d10 piercing damage.

01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.125
18 points of piercing damage against it.

01:56:39.965 --> 01:56:42.725
Plus 8d6 lightning damage.

01:56:42.725 --> 01:56:46.308
TRAVIS: Ooh, those fucking ballistas are no joke.

01:56:47.636 --> 01:56:49.853
MATT: I'm just not going to roll.

01:56:49.853 --> 01:56:51.665
As he fires in an upward angle,

01:56:51.665 --> 01:56:53.651
it shoots into its torso, and the creature gets

01:56:53.651 --> 01:56:56.621
lifted at almost the exact same speed,

01:56:56.621 --> 01:57:00.068
thrust upward off the deck and almost beans you in the face.

01:57:00.068 --> 01:57:03.545
As it swings past, an arc of energy trailing behind it,

01:57:03.545 --> 01:57:07.826
as it vanishes into the storm, no longer able to be stable.

01:57:07.826 --> 01:57:09.440
Both of you are un-grappled.

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:11.685
(cheering)

01:57:11.685 --> 01:57:14.187
LAURA: I'm glad it let go of us as it was going away.

01:57:14.187 --> 01:57:15.779
TALIESIN: Before it flew.

01:57:17.042 --> 01:57:18.834
MATT: All righty. That finishes...

01:57:21.912 --> 01:57:23.426
the crew's go.

01:57:23.426 --> 01:57:26.426
It is now the mage's turn, who is...

01:57:27.719 --> 01:57:29.762
is not doing well in the mouth of that.

01:57:29.762 --> 01:57:32.196
It's going to go ahead and...

01:57:33.144 --> 01:57:35.474
It's going to emit a psychic screech--

01:57:35.474 --> 01:57:38.266
LIAM: Oh dear.
MATT: -- as its action and (screeching),

01:57:38.266 --> 01:57:40.709
just gives this high pitched, horrible sound

01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:42.313
that billows in a 30-foot radius,

01:57:42.313 --> 01:57:45.201
which will only affect you and the captain.

01:57:45.201 --> 01:57:47.231
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

01:57:47.231 --> 01:57:48.064
LIAM: That should go well.

01:57:48.064 --> 01:57:49.322
Nope.

01:57:49.322 --> 01:57:50.263
That's a five.

01:57:50.263 --> 01:57:52.107
MATT: Yeah, and the captain fails, too.

01:57:52.107 --> 01:57:53.777
He falls to his knees, clutching his head.

01:57:53.777 --> 01:57:55.197
You are both stunned.

01:57:55.197 --> 01:57:57.837
LIAM: (groaning)
Is he still in my mouth?

01:57:57.837 --> 01:57:59.830
MATT: I will say--
LIAM: He didn't try to get out.

01:57:59.830 --> 01:58:01.022
MATT: He didn't try to get out yet.

01:58:01.022 --> 01:58:02.338
LIAM: It's just like the crab people.

01:58:02.338 --> 01:58:03.171
They were--
MARISHA: Yes, exactly.

01:58:03.171 --> 01:58:05.583
They kept me held on.

01:58:05.583 --> 01:58:06.884
LAURA: "Is it still in my mouth?" (laughing)

01:58:06.884 --> 01:58:10.197
MATT: So until the end of its next turn, you are stunned.

01:58:10.197 --> 01:58:11.563
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: Which means it'll make it easier

01:58:11.563 --> 01:58:13.410
for it to escape next turn.
LAURA: I was thinking about--

01:58:13.410 --> 01:58:15.362
MATT: So, that finishes its go.
LAURA: -- the T-Rex trying to cover his ears

01:58:15.362 --> 01:58:17.471
with his teeny T-rex arms.
MATT: Beauregard.

01:58:17.471 --> 01:58:18.362
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:58:18.362 --> 01:58:19.242
MATT: Beauregard.

01:58:19.242 --> 01:58:20.562
You're up.

01:58:20.562 --> 01:58:23.476
MARISHA: Okay, I was being a T-Rex.

01:58:23.476 --> 01:58:25.209
I'm sorry.

01:58:25.209 --> 01:58:26.042
TALIESIN: Haven't we all.

01:58:26.042 --> 01:58:28.380
MARISHA: Where am I? Here I am.
MATT: You're right there.

01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:30.478
MARISHA: Where's Avantika?
MATT: Right there.

01:58:30.478 --> 01:58:33.168
MARISHA: She's holding a thing.

01:58:33.168 --> 01:58:34.524
She's still holding it, yeah?

01:58:34.524 --> 01:58:36.814
MATT: She put into her a little side pouch pocket.

01:58:36.814 --> 01:58:40.608
MARISHA: She put it into her pocket.

01:58:40.608 --> 01:58:44.156
And I'm going to just go over
and beat her ass, at this point.

01:58:44.156 --> 01:58:45.489
MATT: All right, go for it.
ASHLEY: Beat her ass!

01:58:45.489 --> 01:58:47.404
LAURA: Yes, finally.

01:58:47.404 --> 01:58:49.788
MATT: So you dart over to close off

01:58:49.788 --> 01:58:51.348
that side of the ship deck.

01:58:51.348 --> 01:58:53.106
MARISHA: I just look at her and I'm like: No.

01:58:53.106 --> 01:58:55.336
And then I punch her.

01:58:55.336 --> 01:58:57.178
MATT: (laughs) "No."
MARISHA: Twice, no.

01:58:57.178 --> 01:58:58.605
MATT: Go for it.

01:58:58.605 --> 01:58:59.992
MARISHA: Oh, jeez.

01:58:59.992 --> 01:59:01.499
All right, all right.

01:59:01.499 --> 01:59:02.936
Okay.

01:59:02.936 --> 01:59:05.175
That one is 28 to hit.

01:59:05.175 --> 01:59:06.038
MATT: 28 hits.

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:08.113
MARISHA: And that one is...

01:59:10.483 --> 01:59:11.957
Hang on, wait.

01:59:11.957 --> 01:59:16.687
20-- yeah, that was 28, and that is 19?

01:59:16.687 --> 01:59:17.951
MATT: 19 misses.

01:59:17.951 --> 01:59:20.726
MARISHA: 19 misses, which sucks.

01:59:20.726 --> 01:59:23.013
But I hit her with that first one.

01:59:23.013 --> 01:59:25.104
LIAM: Good.
TRAVIS: 19 misses.

01:59:25.104 --> 01:59:26.594
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: 20 misses.

01:59:26.594 --> 01:59:29.683
MARISHA: That's an eight. That's good.

01:59:29.683 --> 01:59:30.958
Okay, okay.

01:59:33.054 --> 01:59:35.918
18 damage, Stunning Strike.

01:59:35.918 --> 01:59:38.335
MATT: 18 damage, Stunning Strike?

01:59:40.079 --> 01:59:41.752
LIAM: <i>Super, fantastique.</i>

01:59:41.752 --> 01:59:44.152
MATT: That is going to be a 18.

01:59:45.006 --> 01:59:46.793
MARISHA: Yeah, she saves.

01:59:46.793 --> 01:59:47.793
MATT: All right.

01:59:50.431 --> 01:59:51.569
MARISHA: Okay.

01:59:51.569 --> 01:59:54.602
Okay, what else can I do, what else can I do?

01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:58.883
Flurry of Blows.

01:59:58.883 --> 02:00:00.687
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:00:00.687 --> 02:00:03.750
MARISHA: I wish there was something more I could do.

02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:05.026
Yikes.

02:00:05.026 --> 02:00:06.541
Definitely one of those misses,

02:00:06.541 --> 02:00:10.583
but the other one is a 19 for 31?

02:00:10.583 --> 02:00:11.632
MATT: That definitely hits.

02:00:12.716 --> 02:00:13.883
LAURA: Jeez louise.

02:00:15.033 --> 02:00:17.895
MARISHA: And that's 17 damage.

02:00:17.895 --> 02:00:19.422
MATT: 17 damage, awesome.

02:00:19.422 --> 02:00:21.327
SAM: Come on, Yasha, batter up.

02:00:21.327 --> 02:00:22.428
Aren't you like--
MATT: Extract Aspects?

02:00:22.428 --> 02:00:24.023
SAM: 90 feet away from the action?

02:00:24.023 --> 02:00:25.273
MATT: Right?
MARISHA: Oh.

02:00:25.273 --> 02:00:27.014
Yeah, Extract Aspects.

02:00:27.014 --> 02:00:28.650
I forgot.
MATT: Your subclass.

02:00:28.650 --> 02:00:30.482
One of the...
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:00:30.482 --> 02:00:31.902
Well, I did it on the lobsters.

02:00:31.902 --> 02:00:33.401
MATT: That's true.
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it on Avantika.

02:00:33.401 --> 02:00:35.088
LIAM: It's busy deck.
MATT: It's a busy deck.

02:00:35.088 --> 02:00:37.409
So as you go in and swing a few times,

02:00:37.409 --> 02:00:39.248
get a couple of hits in, with that final blow,

02:00:39.248 --> 02:00:42.190
you manage to concentrate on the energetic flow

02:00:42.190 --> 02:00:44.611
that keeps Avantika standing, the essence of her body,

02:00:44.611 --> 02:00:47.472
and as you take a moment to get in tune with that,

02:00:47.472 --> 02:00:49.963
you sense that she is

02:00:49.963 --> 02:00:51.711
resistant to necrotic damage.

02:00:51.711 --> 02:00:52.702
MARISHA: Sure.

02:00:52.702 --> 02:00:56.076
MATT: She is immune to being charmed, frightened,

02:00:56.076 --> 02:00:57.901
poisoned, and stunned.

02:00:57.901 --> 02:00:59.514
SAM: Ooh.
LIAM: Oh.

02:00:59.514 --> 02:01:01.515
She's your nemesis.

02:01:01.515 --> 02:01:03.114
MARISHA: Bitch.

02:01:03.114 --> 02:01:05.467
TRAVIS: She can't be charmed, frightened, or stunned, and--

02:01:05.467 --> 02:01:06.500
MATT: And poisoned.

02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:07.683
LAURA: She can't be charmed?

02:01:07.683 --> 02:01:08.941
MATT: She can't be charmed.

02:01:08.941 --> 02:01:11.728
LAURA: So that Dominate Person wouldn't have worked anyway?

02:01:11.728 --> 02:01:12.654
MATT: Probably not, yeah.
MARISHA: Charmed,

02:01:12.654 --> 02:01:15.863
frightened, stunned, poisoned.

02:01:15.863 --> 02:01:18.096
TRAVIS: Wow.
LIAM: Because she's a dead person.

02:01:18.096 --> 02:01:19.705
MARISHA: Because she's dead, okay.

02:01:19.705 --> 02:01:21.899
TRAVIS: Hell hath no fury.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:01:21.899 --> 02:01:24.260
TALIESIN: And immune to necrotic.

02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.259
MARISHA: And immune to necrotic.

02:01:25.259 --> 02:01:26.734
ASHLEY: Immune to necrotic. Okay.

02:01:28.813 --> 02:01:30.579
MARISHA: Okay.

02:01:30.579 --> 02:01:33.890
SAM: But she's not immune to one thing.

02:01:33.890 --> 02:01:35.071
Boomerang!

02:01:35.071 --> 02:01:36.146
(laughter)

02:01:36.146 --> 02:01:37.458
MATT: Nobody is, Sam.

02:01:37.458 --> 02:01:38.449
Nobody.

02:01:38.449 --> 02:01:40.131
TALIESIN: I like the way you brought that back around.

02:01:40.131 --> 02:01:41.484
MATT: So Beau, that finishes your turn?

02:01:41.484 --> 02:01:44.045
MARISHA: Yeah, and I shout everything out to the group.

02:01:44.045 --> 02:01:45.660
MATT: Okay, so as Beauregard is pulling back

02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:48.152
and giving this instruction, we go to Fjord's turn,

02:01:48.152 --> 02:01:49.518
with Yasha on deck.

02:01:50.547 --> 02:01:51.380
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:52.217
LIAM: Charge.

02:01:52.217 --> 02:01:53.050
MARISHA: Okay.

02:01:54.166 --> 02:01:57.138
TRAVIS: For my bonus action, I'm going to cast

02:01:57.138 --> 02:01:59.671
Searing Smite at 1st-level,

02:02:01.154 --> 02:02:06.154
and I'm going to take two swings
with the Star Razor at Avantika.

02:02:06.161 --> 02:02:07.921
MATT: Go for it.

02:02:07.921 --> 02:02:09.088
TRAVIS: Oof oof oof.

02:02:12.225 --> 02:02:13.066
Motherfucker.

02:02:13.066 --> 02:02:15.159
That is a 19.

02:02:15.159 --> 02:02:16.634
MATT: 19 misses.

02:02:17.779 --> 02:02:20.115
TRAVIS: Second one.

02:02:20.115 --> 02:02:20.948
Nope.

02:02:21.962 --> 02:02:24.818
MATT: You try and swing, and she deflects and parries

02:02:24.818 --> 02:02:26.842
with her offhand dagger, this horrible,

02:02:26.842 --> 02:02:29.163
hooked black metal dagger, the rapier's just at the ready,

02:02:29.163 --> 02:02:31.546
preparing for her next round. Just (metal clanging).

02:02:31.546 --> 02:02:33.404
TRAVIS: Yep, yep, yep, yep-yep, yep, yep.

02:02:33.404 --> 02:02:35.911
MATT: All right. Fjord, staying put,
or are you going to move?

02:02:35.911 --> 02:02:37.494
TRAVIS: Staying put.
MATT: All right, finishes Fjord's go.

02:02:37.494 --> 02:02:38.327
Yasha, you're up.

02:02:38.327 --> 02:02:39.785
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay.

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:44.461
So these, these, these, these bal--

02:02:44.461 --> 02:02:46.512
these things, these weapons, ballistas.

02:02:46.512 --> 02:02:48.100
MATT: Yes.

02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:49.803
ASHLEY: Can anybody use them?

02:02:49.803 --> 02:02:50.819
MATT: Yeah. It takes an--

02:02:50.819 --> 02:02:53.611
You gather it takes an action to load it

02:02:53.611 --> 02:02:55.130
and then an action to fire.

02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:57.955
So it does a lot of damage, but it takes

02:02:57.955 --> 02:03:00.143
either a two-person team to do it every round,

02:03:00.143 --> 02:03:02.030
or one person once every two rounds.

02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:03.246
ASHLEY: That feels like a lot of work.

02:03:03.246 --> 02:03:04.783
Okay.

02:03:04.783 --> 02:03:06.924
I'm going to start making my way down--

02:03:06.924 --> 02:03:08.933
SAM and MARISHA:
♪ (opening notes of "A Thousand Miles") ♪

02:03:08.933 --> 02:03:11.483
ASHLEY: -- to Miss Avantika.

02:03:13.110 --> 02:03:14.720
MATT: 40'll get you right there.

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:16.070
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: I love us.

02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:18.711
(laughter)

02:03:19.714 --> 02:03:21.941
MARISHA: Just made of inside jokes.

02:03:21.941 --> 02:03:24.001
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to take an attack.

02:03:24.001 --> 02:03:26.811
SAM: The same three inside jokes over and over again.

02:03:26.811 --> 02:03:29.438
MATT: Go for it. You got your strikes on this.

02:03:29.438 --> 02:03:31.947
LIAM: It's 10% gravitas and 90% bullshit.

02:03:33.855 --> 02:03:34.781
ASHLEY: Goddamn it.

02:03:34.781 --> 02:03:37.315
18 for the first hit.

02:03:37.315 --> 02:03:38.335
So that obviously doesn't hit.

02:03:38.335 --> 02:03:40.343
TALIESIN: Oh, wait are you--
MATT: 18 does not hit.

02:03:40.343 --> 02:03:41.260
TALIESIN: Is she...

02:03:42.307 --> 02:03:44.080
You're a... Buh dih buh dah.

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:44.913
LAURA: What?

02:03:44.913 --> 02:03:46.120
TALIESIN: When someone's on the other side of you.

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:46.953
LAURA: Flanked?
TALIESIN: Flanked.

02:03:46.953 --> 02:03:48.705
MATT: She is not flanking, because in order to get

02:03:48.705 --> 02:03:50.177
into melee with Avantika, she's coming

02:03:50.177 --> 02:03:51.177
at catty-corner position.

02:03:51.177 --> 02:03:52.272
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:03:52.272 --> 02:03:53.105
Darn.

02:03:53.105 --> 02:03:54.847
ASHLEY: Okay, let's do it again.

02:03:56.458 --> 02:03:57.883
Oh, oh.

02:03:57.883 --> 02:03:59.126
28.
MATT: That hits.

02:03:59.126 --> 02:04:00.230
Go ahead and roll damage.

02:04:00.230 --> 02:04:02.068
This is full damage because
it's your first time hitting in the round.

02:04:02.068 --> 02:04:05.441
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

02:04:05.441 --> 02:04:06.274
Okay.

02:04:07.339 --> 02:04:08.672
Savage Attacker.

02:04:09.837 --> 02:04:10.837
Much better.

02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.625
30 points of damage.

02:04:18.625 --> 02:04:19.941
MATT: Ooh!

02:04:21.777 --> 02:04:23.579
The first, as you rush down the stairs,

02:04:23.579 --> 02:04:25.429
getting your blade in this one upward arc,

02:04:25.429 --> 02:04:27.229
it's a bit telegraphed, and as you rush down,

02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:28.687
Avantika sidesteps to the side

02:04:28.687 --> 02:04:30.548
and it slams into the ground.

02:04:30.548 --> 02:04:33.340
In that moment, you use that to pull upward at an angle.

02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:36.755
As you do, you strike her right in the side. She (grimaces).

02:04:36.755 --> 02:04:38.110
ASHLEY: I have a question.

02:04:38.110 --> 02:04:38.943
MATT: Yes?

02:04:41.308 --> 02:04:43.033
ASHLEY: Because I'm using Magician's Judge,

02:04:43.033 --> 02:04:44.914
because I attuned to it--

02:04:44.914 --> 02:04:45.747
MATT: Correct.

02:04:46.826 --> 02:04:49.733
ASHLEY: It says if I hit a creature with this weapon,

02:04:49.733 --> 02:04:52.220
you can choose to cast Dispel Magic.

02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:53.344
MATT: Correct.

02:04:53.344 --> 02:04:57.869
ASHLEY: Can I try to Dispel Magic

02:04:57.869 --> 02:04:59.727
on the Cloven Crystal?

02:05:00.792 --> 02:05:03.245
MATT: Unfortunately, Dispel Magic
is to stop magical effects,

02:05:03.245 --> 02:05:06.063
like spells or, you know, things that are lasting attacks.

02:05:06.063 --> 02:05:08.828
You cannot dispel a magical item necessarily.
ASHLEY: Copy.

02:05:08.828 --> 02:05:09.661
Okay.

02:05:09.661 --> 02:05:10.737
MATT: And since you're attacking her, it would

02:05:10.737 --> 02:05:11.927
have to be an effect that's affecting her.

02:05:11.927 --> 02:05:14.042
ASHLEY: Copy, okay.
MATT: But good looking out, good looking out.

02:05:14.042 --> 02:05:15.875
That finish your turn?

02:05:17.824 --> 02:05:19.052
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

02:05:19.052 --> 02:05:20.702
It is now Avantika's turn.

02:05:20.702 --> 02:05:23.308
Avantika is in both of your radiuses.
LIAM: Get ready to sentinel.

02:05:23.308 --> 02:05:26.027
Fucking dual clerics, man, I swear to god.

02:05:26.027 --> 02:05:28.185
Natural one on yours.

02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:32.640
And hold on, even with the bonus?

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:34.753
Fail on both, full damage on both.

02:05:34.753 --> 02:05:36.970
That's some shitty rolls.

02:05:38.014 --> 02:05:38.847
LAURA: 21.

02:05:38.847 --> 02:05:40.348
MATT: 21 damage? All right.

02:05:40.348 --> 02:05:41.269
TALIESIN: 22.

02:05:41.269 --> 02:05:42.436
MATT: Damn!
SAM: Whoa.

02:05:43.330 --> 02:05:44.239
TALIESIN: Burn.

02:05:44.239 --> 02:05:45.364
Burn!

02:05:45.364 --> 02:05:46.681
LAURA: 40!

02:05:46.681 --> 02:05:51.182
MATT: After she takes the blow from Yasha's attack

02:05:51.182 --> 02:05:54.896
and the blade pulls away, a bit of dark gray liquid

02:05:54.896 --> 02:05:56.619
that was once blood that no longer flows

02:05:56.619 --> 02:05:59.208
and pumps through her body naturally.

02:05:59.208 --> 02:06:01.261
As she prepares herself,

02:06:01.261 --> 02:06:04.819
all the surrounding, swirling, celestial insects

02:06:04.819 --> 02:06:07.027
and hamster unicorns are blasting into her

02:06:07.027 --> 02:06:08.970
and you can see the skin burning away at certain points

02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:10.650
of her jaw and face.

02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:14.625
(snarling, panting)

02:06:16.558 --> 02:06:18.336
"I got what I came for."

02:06:18.336 --> 02:06:21.543
And she's going to use her last slot to cast Dimension Door.

02:06:21.543 --> 02:06:23.506
LIAM: Oh!
LAURA: Oh no.

02:06:23.506 --> 02:06:24.407
MATT: And you are T-Rex.

02:06:24.407 --> 02:06:26.391
LIAM: I'm a T-Rex, I'm eating.

02:06:26.391 --> 02:06:27.661
SAM: Damn it!

02:06:27.661 --> 02:06:30.765
MARISHA: Wait, does that give an opportunity attack?

02:06:30.765 --> 02:06:31.598
LAURA: No.
LIAM and MATT: Nope.

02:06:31.598 --> 02:06:32.506
LAURA: You don't get an attack.

02:06:32.506 --> 02:06:35.598
MATT: Unless anyone has the Mage Slayer feat.

02:06:35.598 --> 02:06:37.519
SAM: Nope.
MATT: Then no.

02:06:37.519 --> 02:06:40.136
LIAM: Well, Fjord, what are you doing?

02:06:40.136 --> 02:06:40.969
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

02:06:40.969 --> 02:06:42.835
TALIESIN: Do you not have a--
SAM: He already burned it.

02:06:42.835 --> 02:06:44.725
TALIESIN: You burned your Counterspell?
LAURA: He already used his Counterspell.

02:06:44.725 --> 02:06:47.060
TRAVIS: I only have, like, two spell slots.

02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:48.702
ASHLEY: There's got to be something I can do!

02:06:48.702 --> 02:06:51.202
We can't grab her or anything?

02:06:51.202 --> 02:06:54.321
MATT: You just see her look over
the edge of the boat this way,

02:06:54.321 --> 02:06:56.888
and then bring her blade up to her face,

02:06:56.888 --> 02:06:58.440
and give a half bow to all of you,

02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:01.812
and then vanish in purple smoke.

02:07:01.812 --> 02:07:02.645
LIAM: I love it.

02:07:02.645 --> 02:07:04.279
ASHLEY: Can I try to throw one of those

02:07:04.279 --> 02:07:06.591
alchemical fire grenades in there?

02:07:06.591 --> 02:07:07.933
MATT: Sure.

02:07:07.933 --> 02:07:09.430
You throw it overboard in her direction

02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:12.072
and it vanishes into the fog.

02:07:12.072 --> 02:07:15.258
But in that brief moment that you realize

02:07:15.258 --> 02:07:17.199
that she is gone,

02:07:18.324 --> 02:07:21.168
with the Cloven Crystal,

02:07:21.168 --> 02:07:22.007
we're going to take a break.

02:07:22.007 --> 02:07:24.016
MARISHA: No!

02:07:24.016 --> 02:07:26.147
MATT: For the purposes of the narrative here,

02:07:26.147 --> 02:07:29.301
this guy has not a whole lot of hit points left.

02:07:29.301 --> 02:07:30.771
He's not a big chunk.

02:07:30.771 --> 02:07:32.246
The T-Rex can eat him next round.

02:07:32.246 --> 02:07:33.463
LIAM: I eat him.
SAM: Wait!

02:07:33.463 --> 02:07:35.784
We're keeping someone alive?

02:07:35.784 --> 02:07:38.488
MARISHA: Yeah, let's interrogate the lobster.
LAURA: They don't even speak, remember?

02:07:38.488 --> 02:07:39.409
SAM: Oh, he's a lobster?

02:07:39.409 --> 02:07:40.509
Oh yeah.

02:07:40.509 --> 02:07:41.642
MATT: Well yeah, this is the mage guy.

02:07:41.642 --> 02:07:43.316
But you are a T-Rex who is hungry.

02:07:43.316 --> 02:07:44.858
LIAM: Yeah, I'm eating him, and you can't stop me

02:07:44.858 --> 02:07:45.816
from eating him. I'm eating him.

02:07:45.816 --> 02:07:48.399
MATT: In the moment you hear the screams and crunching

02:07:48.399 --> 02:07:50.439
on the upper part of the deck, you all take a moment

02:07:50.439 --> 02:07:52.270
to realize what just happened,

02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:53.555
and you have a break to decide

02:07:53.555 --> 02:07:56.732
what you want to do as a reaction.

02:07:56.732 --> 02:07:58.632
We'll be back here in just a minute.

02:07:58.632 --> 02:08:01.299
We'll see you guys here shortly.

02:08:00.771 --> 02:08:03.491
Announcer: Now experienced the ultimate way to play

02:08:03.491 --> 02:08:06.481
by sitting at a table with your friends

02:08:06.481 --> 02:08:08.461
with your face in a screen.

02:08:08.461 --> 02:08:09.771
Progress!

02:08:09.771 --> 02:08:11.751
D&amp;D Beyond.

02:08:11.751 --> 02:08:15.701
Log in to explore strange worlds and fantastical cities,

02:08:15.701 --> 02:08:18.811
thanks to a company based in a really boring one

02:08:18.811 --> 02:08:21.371
that handles all the tedious math and reference stuff

02:08:21.371 --> 02:08:24.371
for you, so you can finally unleash the epic quest

02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:27.261
you've been crafting since middle school on your friends

02:08:27.261 --> 02:08:29.521
or just do what most people use it for,

02:08:29.521 --> 02:08:31.141
cranking out endless new characters

02:08:31.141 --> 02:08:32.388
while they're bored at work.

02:08:32.388 --> 02:08:34.161
"I could finish these spreadsheets

02:08:34.161 --> 02:08:37.388
but what if this Paladin owned a horse?"

02:08:37.388 --> 02:08:39.489
(angelic music)

02:08:39.489 --> 02:08:40.611
Perfect.

02:08:40.611 --> 02:08:44.891
D&amp;D Beyond. Play with advantage.

02:08:44.891 --> 02:08:46.821
I think we need to reincorporate ice giants

02:08:46.821 --> 02:08:49.781
and frost giants into the lore of the North Pole.

02:08:49.781 --> 02:08:50.881
I think it's just-

02:08:50.881 --> 02:08:52.961
Everyone knows that the North Pole

02:08:52.961 --> 02:08:55.881
is guarded by a family of frost giants,

02:08:55.881 --> 02:08:57.801
and originally before reindeer,

02:08:57.801 --> 02:09:00.251
Santa Claus' sled was pulled by yetis.

02:09:00.251 --> 02:09:02.021
Does not everybody know that?

02:09:02.021 --> 02:09:03.764
See, I want, I want that movie.

02:09:03.764 --> 02:09:05.411
I want to see like,

02:09:05.411 --> 02:09:06.991
they were like, "Oh, Santa and his elves,

02:09:06.991 --> 02:09:08.431
every single gift in the world.

02:09:08.431 --> 02:09:09.961
Think of all the eBay money we can make!

02:09:09.961 --> 02:09:10.971
We're just going to go ahead and do it.

02:09:10.971 --> 02:09:13.221
The greatest heist of Old St. Nick,"

02:09:13.221 --> 02:09:15.211
and they get there and there's just this giant

02:09:15.211 --> 02:09:16.948
sitting there armored up going,

02:09:16.948 --> 02:09:19.174
"Mr. Claus didn't invite you."

02:09:19.174 --> 02:09:20.844
(imitates smashing)

02:09:20.844 --> 02:09:23.427 line:20%
(upbeat music)

02:09:40.445 --> 02:09:42.862
(soft music)

02:10:10.791 --> 02:10:12.931
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:10:12.931 --> 02:10:15.314
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role Shop.

02:10:17.216 --> 02:10:19.681
The Traveler always says impulse purchases

02:10:19.681 --> 02:10:21.154
are a good decision.

02:10:23.767 --> 02:10:26.434
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

02:10:29.407 --> 02:10:30.851
Roll an investigation, if you want.

02:10:30.851 --> 02:10:33.194
It's basically perfect.

02:10:36.061 --> 02:10:38.814
Go ahead, darling. Treat yourself.

02:10:41.921 --> 02:10:43.651
Can you put donuts in this?

02:10:43.651 --> 02:10:46.638
I don't know, only one way to find out.

02:10:47.771 --> 02:10:50.034
So click on over to the Critical Role Shop.

02:10:50.931 --> 02:10:52.881
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:10:52.881 --> 02:10:53.981
You've still got time.

02:10:57.907 --> 02:10:59.431
(dramatic music)

02:10:59.431 --> 02:11:01.961
I started with my kid gloves with our first story,

02:11:01.961 --> 02:11:04.081
and now that I know that we've all felt the true pain.

02:11:04.081 --> 02:11:05.001
Pretty hard.

02:11:05.001 --> 02:11:08.321
Matt going full throttle though, terrifies me.

02:11:08.321 --> 02:11:09.154
It should.

02:11:11.491 --> 02:11:13.591
That was tough, my god.

02:11:13.591 --> 02:11:15.191
Maybe the next person should be

02:11:15.191 --> 02:11:17.501
like super easy or something like that.

02:11:17.501 --> 02:11:21.168
No.
Yeah.

02:11:21.168 --> 02:11:24.082
I hate this, I'm so glad we're done with this.

02:11:24.082 --> 02:11:25.451
(all laughing)

02:11:25.451 --> 02:11:26.284
We're not.

02:11:26.284 --> 02:11:28.352
I feel that, I feel that.
We're coming back, Ashley.

02:11:28.352 --> 02:11:29.704
No! No!

02:11:31.061 --> 02:11:33.721
And guys, I've learned so much

02:11:34.631 --> 02:11:36.466
from all of you.

02:11:36.466 --> 02:11:38.186
No, Matthew!

02:11:38.186 --> 02:11:39.677
What does that mean?

02:11:39.677 --> 02:11:42.260
(upbeat music)

02:11:56.906 --> 02:11:59.323
(jazz music)

02:12:00.861 --> 02:12:02.271
Hello, everyone.

02:12:02.271 --> 02:12:05.501 line:20%
It's me, Marisha Ray, creative director

02:12:05.501 --> 02:12:08.491 line:20%
for Critical Role content, and I want to take a moment

02:12:08.491 --> 02:12:10.411 line:20%
to speak from the heart about how much

02:12:10.411 --> 02:12:12.621 line:20%
we appreciate your support.

02:12:12.621 --> 02:12:17.031
No frills, no crazy gags. Just honesty.

02:12:17.031 --> 02:12:19.261
Over the past five years, we've made a lot

02:12:19.261 --> 02:12:22.001
of ridiculous promos in an attempt to earn

02:12:22.001 --> 02:12:24.301
your subscription here on Twitch.

02:12:24.301 --> 02:12:26.841
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor,

02:12:26.841 --> 02:12:30.331
cheap costumes, and putting our loyal employees

02:12:30.331 --> 02:12:32.191
in slightly embarrassing situations,

02:12:32.191 --> 02:12:35.351
eagerly hoping that we've captured your attention.

02:12:35.351 --> 02:12:38.861
Today, I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

02:12:38.861 --> 02:12:41.411
written by Brian W. Foster

02:12:41.411 --> 02:12:44.321
or dressing Sam as a celebrity to recreate

02:12:44.321 --> 02:12:47.331
an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

02:12:47.331 --> 02:12:48.871
to remind you that subscribing

02:12:48.871 --> 02:12:51.051
with a Twitch Prime account requires you

02:12:51.051 --> 02:12:52.901
to resubscribe each month.

02:12:52.901 --> 02:12:56.501
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

02:12:56.501 --> 02:12:59.041
or have to put Matt in cosplay to tell you

02:12:59.041 --> 02:13:01.281
that you can easily give subscriptions

02:13:01.281 --> 02:13:03.761
to fellow Critters if you're feeling generous.

02:13:03.761 --> 02:13:07.631
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

02:13:07.631 --> 02:13:09.671
shooting complicated parody promos

02:13:09.671 --> 02:13:12.656
featuring Taliesin Jaffe is a vintage spooky boy

02:13:12.656 --> 02:13:16.121
in full monochromatic glory, all in the hope

02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:21.121
that your smile may turn into a sub, but not today.

02:13:22.171 --> 02:13:25.394 line:20%
No weird graphics, no puppet murder.

02:13:26.861 --> 02:13:27.934
No Sam Reigel.

02:13:31.881 --> 02:13:32.854
It's just me,

02:13:33.941 --> 02:13:36.534
here to say thank you.

02:13:38.011 --> 02:13:41.625
Love you all. Good night.

02:13:41.625 --> 02:13:44.042
(jazz music)

02:27:34.434 --> 02:27:36.105
MATT: And welcome back.

02:27:36.105 --> 02:27:40.974
So, where we left off, in the middle of this

02:27:40.974 --> 02:27:43.819
unexpected, chaotic battle on the top

02:27:43.819 --> 02:27:46.101
of the Midnight Hammer icebreaker ship

02:27:46.101 --> 02:27:49.980
in the Frigid Depths, north of the Greying Wildlands,

02:27:49.980 --> 02:27:52.267
you were all unexpectedly ambushed

02:27:52.267 --> 02:27:56.208
by Captain Avantika, back from the grave.

02:27:56.208 --> 02:27:58.511
Now currently even further empowered

02:27:58.511 --> 02:28:02.848
and focused by her patron, Uk'otoa,

02:28:02.848 --> 02:28:05.883
long abandoned by Fjord Stone,

02:28:05.883 --> 02:28:09.807
and seeking the final orb that would unlock, unseal,

02:28:09.807 --> 02:28:12.807
and release Uk'otoa from his prison.

02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:15.788
In the middle of this battle, you tore through

02:28:15.788 --> 02:28:18.549
the various crawling chuul creatures

02:28:18.549 --> 02:28:20.154
that were coming your way from the ocean below,

02:28:20.154 --> 02:28:21.441
the crustaceans.

02:28:21.441 --> 02:28:25.303
You turned into a T-Rex and swallowed

02:28:25.303 --> 02:28:28.085
the the mage companion to Avantika,

02:28:28.085 --> 02:28:31.150
the demonic creature, the strange frog individual

02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:33.029
that was tethered in some way to Avantika,

02:28:33.029 --> 02:28:35.864
called through, seems to have vanished

02:28:35.864 --> 02:28:39.475
with some of the damage that she had taken recently,

02:28:39.475 --> 02:28:43.925
no longer held in this domain by her concentration.

02:28:45.174 --> 02:28:48.710
But she did manage to grab the orb,

02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:52.465
and with a small bow, vanished from sight,

02:28:52.465 --> 02:28:55.818
facing in a somewhat west, southwest direction

02:28:55.818 --> 02:28:59.614
from where the ship is currently heading.

02:28:59.614 --> 02:29:00.745
What would you like to do?

02:29:00.745 --> 02:29:01.706
SAM: Oh my god.

02:29:01.706 --> 02:29:02.947
LAURA: What do we do? What do we do?

02:29:02.947 --> 02:29:04.214
SAM: What happened?

02:29:04.214 --> 02:29:06.332
TALIESIN: Going for it.
SAM: This is crazy.

02:29:06.332 --> 02:29:07.751
TALIESIN: Don't let her get away.

02:29:07.751 --> 02:29:08.691
SAM: What do we do?

02:29:08.691 --> 02:29:10.306
MATT: What are you doing?
MARISHA: We very much lost.

02:29:10.306 --> 02:29:12.608
TALIESIN: I am throwing Divine Intervention.

02:29:12.608 --> 02:29:14.670
SAM: Does anyone need healing or anything?

02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:15.503
MATT: Okay.

02:29:15.503 --> 02:29:16.519
MARISHA: In pain.
TALIESIN: I did not succeed.

02:29:16.519 --> 02:29:18.094
LAURA: I'm going to Divine Intervention, too.

02:29:18.094 --> 02:29:18.927
MATT: Okay.

02:29:19.836 --> 02:29:20.669
TRAVIS: Yeah, man.

02:29:20.669 --> 02:29:23.481
We only got two of these. They're worth a shot.
SAM: I'm also going to Divine Intervention.

02:29:23.481 --> 02:29:24.822
LAURA: Two-- okay.

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.267
SAM: I found Jesus.

02:29:26.267 --> 02:29:28.349
LAURA: What am I trying to roll? Below my--

02:29:28.349 --> 02:29:30.418
MATT: Your level or below, so 13 or under.

02:29:30.418 --> 02:29:33.066
So declare one is as the digit, the tens.

02:29:33.066 --> 02:29:35.157
LAURA: I've got the doubles and the single
MATT: You got it.

02:29:35.157 --> 02:29:36.281
Go for it.

02:29:36.281 --> 02:29:37.114
LIAM: Come on.

02:29:39.057 --> 02:29:40.749
LAURA: No.
MATT: No.

02:29:40.749 --> 02:29:43.645
Unfortunately, your entities cannot reach you

02:29:43.645 --> 02:29:45.852
in the midst of this chaos.

02:29:45.852 --> 02:29:46.707
TRAVIS: Neither worked.
MARISHA: No?

02:29:46.707 --> 02:29:47.813
LAURA: Are we going after her?

02:29:47.813 --> 02:29:49.592
MATT: The force and influence of Uk'otoa--

02:29:49.592 --> 02:29:51.386
TRAVIS: Can anyone make us dolphins or something?

02:29:51.386 --> 02:29:53.167
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly heal everybody,

02:29:53.167 --> 02:29:54.528
just with a quick action.

02:29:54.528 --> 02:29:55.628
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm going to, yeah,

02:29:55.628 --> 02:29:58.080
hit everyone with a Mass Cure Wounds.

02:29:58.080 --> 02:29:59.626
LAURA: Who's going after her?

02:29:59.626 --> 02:30:01.505
MARISHA: Maybe--
TRAVIS: I would like to go.

02:30:01.505 --> 02:30:03.483
MARISHA: I would like to go, but maybe I can run along

02:30:03.483 --> 02:30:05.759
the surface and chase you guys.
TALIESIN: 15.

02:30:05.759 --> 02:30:07.971
SAM: Hey, that's great.
LAURA: Okay.

02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:09.221
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Yasha?

02:30:11.947 --> 02:30:13.205
ASHLEY: Yeah, I could do it.

02:30:13.205 --> 02:30:14.707
I could also try to run?

02:30:14.707 --> 02:30:16.556
I don't have cold damage.

02:30:16.556 --> 02:30:19.109
I mean, I don't have cold resistance. Does that matter?

02:30:19.109 --> 02:30:20.223
LAURA: I don't know.

02:30:20.223 --> 02:30:23.733
MATT: Well, does anyone here have Water Walk?

02:30:23.733 --> 02:30:26.114
TALIESIN, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: We all do.

02:30:26.114 --> 02:30:26.947
MATT: Okay, that's right.

02:30:26.947 --> 02:30:28.935
How long does that last?

02:30:30.189 --> 02:30:32.199
LAURA: It lasts for an hour, doesn't it?

02:30:32.199 --> 02:30:34.590
TALIESIN: Longer, I think, hold on.

02:30:34.590 --> 02:30:35.702
MATT: Just double-check.

02:30:35.702 --> 02:30:36.759
SAM: When did you cast it?

02:30:36.759 --> 02:30:38.293
LAURA: At the beginning of the fight.
MARISHA: Top of the fight.

02:30:38.293 --> 02:30:39.880
LIAM: Oh, you're all water skiing.

02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:41.560
MARISHA: Yes.
TALIESIN: One hour, you're right,

02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:42.552
LIAM: Rogues water skiing.
MATT: Okay.

02:30:42.552 --> 02:30:45.665
MARISHA: I'm down to water ski a killer whale.

02:30:45.665 --> 02:30:47.582
TALIESIN: We've got Water Walk.

02:30:49.166 --> 02:30:50.900
LAURA: Can you drop it on some people?

02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:52.083
TALIESIN: Everyone's got it.

02:30:52.083 --> 02:30:53.376
I cast it at the beginning of this-

02:30:53.376 --> 02:30:57.544
LAURA: No, I mean, if we polymorph into sea creatures,

02:30:57.544 --> 02:31:00.527
will we just be sea creatures stuck on top of the water?

02:31:00.527 --> 02:31:01.727
MATT: (thumping)

02:31:01.727 --> 02:31:03.210
TALIESIN: I think you can just disengage it at will.

02:31:03.210 --> 02:31:05.471
MARISHA: Just jet skiing off a killer whale?

02:31:05.471 --> 02:31:07.872
LAURA: If you disengage some
people does it disengage everybody?

02:31:07.872 --> 02:31:09.480
TALIESIN: Yeah, because it's not a concentration spell.

02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:11.523
I think you can just decide that it's over.

02:31:11.523 --> 02:31:12.878
MATT: I will say you can decide to end it

02:31:12.878 --> 02:31:15.130
on a person who it's currently on, on an individual basis.

02:31:15.130 --> 02:31:16.595
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Hexblade's Curse doesn't provide

02:31:16.595 --> 02:31:18.261
a Hunter's Mark capability.

02:31:18.261 --> 02:31:19.761
MATT: No, it does not.

02:31:20.718 --> 02:31:22.172
TRAVIS: Not like that.
LAURA: All right.

02:31:22.172 --> 02:31:25.154
I'm going to Polymorph a couple people.
LIAM: So are we going different directions?

02:31:25.154 --> 02:31:27.142
We're going the way she left?

02:31:27.142 --> 02:31:28.355
I was a dinosaur, what happened?

02:31:28.355 --> 02:31:30.772
LAURA: I think we just--

02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:33.870
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should--
LAURA: Jesus. 100 feet.

02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:35.726
TRAVIS: I'm with you, if she was pointing one direction,

02:31:35.726 --> 02:31:38.104
we should all three take that direction,

02:31:38.104 --> 02:31:40.306
make a variance of, like, 15 to 20 degrees

02:31:40.306 --> 02:31:42.227
off of that center line and just go like that.

02:31:42.227 --> 02:31:43.060
MARISHA: And then go that way. Yes.
LAURA: All right, let's go.

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:45.440
LIAM: Okay, so who are the killer whales?

02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:46.290
You and me?

02:31:46.290 --> 02:31:48.227
LAURA: I'm not being a whale; I'm going to ride a whale.

02:31:48.227 --> 02:31:49.227
TRAVIS: I'll be one.

02:31:49.227 --> 02:31:51.019
LAURA: Whale.
LIAM: Whale.

02:31:51.019 --> 02:31:53.003
ASHLEY: I'll be a whale, I'll be a whale, I'll be a whale!

02:31:53.003 --> 02:31:57.399
LAURA: All right, I'm going to
use my Ring of Spell Splitting,

02:31:57.399 --> 02:32:00.939
and I'm going to cast Polymorph on both Yasha and Fjord,

02:32:00.939 --> 02:32:03.254
and turn them both into killer whales.

02:32:03.254 --> 02:32:05.795
As we leap off the ship.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'd like to jump off.

02:32:05.795 --> 02:32:07.749
MATT: Both you and Fjord look at each other,

02:32:07.749 --> 02:32:09.974
nod, and then go into a sprint and then

02:32:09.974 --> 02:32:13.093
dive off the edge of the ship.
LAURA: And as they dive, I'm going to cast it out.

02:32:13.093 --> 02:32:15.659
MATT: In mid-arc, they both balloon out

02:32:15.659 --> 02:32:19.965
into massive, black and white orcas

02:32:19.965 --> 02:32:23.576
before crashing into the icy waters below,

02:32:23.576 --> 02:32:25.438
of which orcas are quite familiar with.

02:32:25.438 --> 02:32:26.896
You aren't affected by the cold temperatures

02:32:26.896 --> 02:32:28.699
of the ocean below you.

02:32:28.699 --> 02:32:30.700
LIAM: I grab a rope and shove it in my mouth

02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:33.309
and I run to the side and turn into an orange and white

02:32:33.309 --> 02:32:36.178
killer whale, like a Fanta mascot, and go (splashes).

02:32:36.178 --> 02:32:37.909
LAURA: I'm going to grab one of the ropes as he jumps

02:32:37.909 --> 02:32:39.384
and I'm going to jump in after him.

02:32:39.384 --> 02:32:40.217
MATT: Okay.

02:32:40.217 --> 02:32:42.471
MARISHA: I run and I grab one of the ropes from the rigging

02:32:42.471 --> 02:32:46.149
and I throw it around Yasha as she transforms.

02:32:46.149 --> 02:32:47.521
TALIESIN: I guess we're doing this.

02:32:47.521 --> 02:32:48.354
MATT: Okay.

02:32:48.354 --> 02:32:49.687
TALIESIN: We're going after her!

02:32:49.687 --> 02:32:50.856
Yep.

02:32:50.856 --> 02:32:52.347
MATT: Okay, so who's--
SAM: Where are we going?

02:32:52.347 --> 02:32:53.180
LIAM: Three directions.

02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:56.654
MATT: So we have two of the killer whales currently have

02:32:56.654 --> 02:32:58.510
ropes in their mouth.

02:32:58.510 --> 02:33:00.514
Who is affixed to which killer whale?

02:33:00.514 --> 02:33:02.882
LAURA: I said I was affixed to the Caleb whale.

02:33:02.882 --> 02:33:04.638
MARISHA: I'm affixed to the Yasha whale.

02:33:04.638 --> 02:33:07.905
TALIESIN: I'll be affixed to-- who else is a whale?

02:33:07.905 --> 02:33:10.049
You're a whale? Fjord, I'm with you.

02:33:10.049 --> 02:33:11.216
MARISHA: Veth?

02:33:11.216 --> 02:33:14.558
SAM: I mean, just gaming this out here.

02:33:14.558 --> 02:33:17.741
If you're attached to, like, a 30-foot rope or something.

02:33:17.741 --> 02:33:18.574
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:33:18.574 --> 02:33:21.279
SAM: What if the whale needs to dive?

02:33:21.279 --> 02:33:22.944
MARISHA: We'll figure that out.
LIAM: Figure that out when we get to it.

02:33:22.944 --> 02:33:25.031
SAM: Let go and hope we can get back?
LAURA: We can all breathe water.

02:33:25.031 --> 02:33:27.506
LAURA: Drop it.
TRAVIS: We can all breathe underwater.

02:33:27.506 --> 02:33:28.339
LIAM: Yeah.

02:33:28.339 --> 02:33:29.935
MARISHA: Veth, get on my back.

02:33:29.935 --> 02:33:31.616
SAM: I don't want to go out there!

02:33:31.616 --> 02:33:34.341
MARISHA: I grab Veth as I fly over the edge.
SAM: (shouting)

02:33:34.341 --> 02:33:35.857
(laughter)

02:33:35.857 --> 02:33:37.546
MATT: Okay, so Veth is going with Beauregard,

02:33:37.546 --> 02:33:39.504
who is currently holding onto the Yasha.
SAM: But it's cold!

02:33:39.504 --> 02:33:41.118
SAM: I don't want to go!

02:33:41.118 --> 02:33:43.164
MATT: Jester, you're going with?

02:33:43.164 --> 02:33:44.550
LAURA: I grabbed the Caleb rope.

02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:46.225
MATT: The Caleb rope. All right.

02:33:46.225 --> 02:33:48.591
And Caduceus, who are you going with?
TALIESIN: I'm on the Fjord rope.

02:33:48.591 --> 02:33:50.913
MATT: Fjord didn't have a rope.

02:33:50.913 --> 02:33:52.128
LAURA: No, he did not grab a rope.

02:33:52.128 --> 02:33:53.277
MATT: He did not grab a rope.

02:33:53.277 --> 02:33:55.335
SAM: Go back and get a rope!

02:33:55.335 --> 02:33:57.131
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing on with Jester, then.

02:33:57.131 --> 02:33:59.565
MATT: All right, Jester and Caduceus,

02:33:59.565 --> 02:34:01.417
you leap off the edge of the ship

02:34:01.417 --> 02:34:05.153
and are pulled down by the weight of an orca

02:34:05.153 --> 02:34:08.419
onto the hard surface of the ocean,

02:34:08.419 --> 02:34:10.475
in which you are water walking.

02:34:10.475 --> 02:34:11.450
So.

02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:14.997
Oh, I was picturing it, like, leaping, trying to be cool.

02:34:14.997 --> 02:34:16.455
MARISHA: Same.
MATT: It is cool.

02:34:16.455 --> 02:34:17.294
It is cool.

02:34:17.294 --> 02:34:19.662
SAM: Down by 2000--
MATT: But you're still being pulled down by 2000 pounds

02:34:19.662 --> 02:34:22.542
into the surface of the ocean in which you are--

02:34:22.542 --> 02:34:23.758
LAURA: I didn't want to water walk,

02:34:23.758 --> 02:34:26.062
I wanted to dive into the water, but--

02:34:26.062 --> 02:34:27.805
SAM: Water Walking is on us. We have to--

02:34:27.805 --> 02:34:29.024
MATT: Unless you wanted to cancel it.

02:34:29.024 --> 02:34:30.789
LAURA: I wanted to cancel, because we can all

02:34:30.789 --> 02:34:32.555
breathe under water too, and I'm cold resistant,

02:34:32.555 --> 02:34:34.802
so I was planning on holding onto the rope and just going.

02:34:34.802 --> 02:34:37.777
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Just imagine it like New Jersey's Action Park.

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:40.701
It's cool.
MATT: Not entirely wrong.

02:34:40.701 --> 02:34:42.524
You're not entirely wrong.

02:34:42.524 --> 02:34:44.361
LIAM: I went there five times as a child.

02:34:44.361 --> 02:34:45.419
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: You did not!

02:34:45.419 --> 02:34:46.924
LIAM: I'm from Jersey, man.
ASHLEY: We need to talk about this later.

02:34:46.924 --> 02:34:48.707
TRAVIS: I have questions.

02:34:48.707 --> 02:34:49.782
LIAM: Yeah, I hurt myself.

02:34:49.782 --> 02:34:51.923
SAM: I'm not cold resistant.

02:34:51.923 --> 02:34:52.975
What are we doing?

02:34:52.975 --> 02:34:54.647
LAURA: I'm just jumping in. I'm cold resistant.

02:34:54.647 --> 02:34:56.722
I don't know if it's smart for everybody to do it.
SAM: I'm not cold resistant. I'm not going in the water.

02:34:56.722 --> 02:34:57.555
TALIESIN: Don't go in the water.

02:34:57.555 --> 02:34:58.988
LIAM: You're on Beauregard's back.
MARISHA: We're skiing.

02:34:58.988 --> 02:35:00.364
SAM: Okay, let's ski on the surface.

02:35:00.364 --> 02:35:01.837
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

02:35:01.837 --> 02:35:03.990
MATT: All right, so you both are keeping Water Walking on.

02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:05.556
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: You're keeping Water Walking on?

02:35:05.556 --> 02:35:06.804
LIAM: This is ridiculous.
MATT: All right.

02:35:06.804 --> 02:35:09.025
You all take six points of bludgeoning damage

02:35:09.025 --> 02:35:12.286
as you impact into the surface and just holding on,

02:35:12.286 --> 02:35:14.156
your feet or skidding across the surface,

02:35:14.156 --> 02:35:15.800
which is slick like ice

02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:17.943
based on both the temperature and the magical effect

02:35:17.943 --> 02:35:18.851
that you're under.

02:35:18.851 --> 02:35:20.451
But with that case, you are being pulled along

02:35:20.451 --> 02:35:21.550
at an immense speed.

02:35:21.550 --> 02:35:22.611
What is the speed of the orca?

02:35:22.611 --> 02:35:23.744
LIAM: 60 feet per round.

02:35:23.744 --> 02:35:27.205
MATT: Which means, at a dash, you
are moving 120 feet per round.

02:35:27.205 --> 02:35:28.372
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:35:30.164 --> 02:35:31.916
MATT: I'm keeping track of the race here now.

02:35:31.916 --> 02:35:33.683
This is interesting.

02:35:33.683 --> 02:35:38.092
TRAVIS: Expeditious Retreat doesn't amp that up, does it?

02:35:38.092 --> 02:35:39.009
MATT: It would.

02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:40.979
TRAVIS: I have that.

02:35:40.979 --> 02:35:41.812
LAURA: But you can't cast it.

02:35:41.812 --> 02:35:43.532
MATT: Can't cast it because you're a whale.

02:35:43.532 --> 02:35:44.852
TRAVIS: Yeah, makes sense.
LIAM: Yes.

02:35:44.852 --> 02:35:46.685
All the spells go away.
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:35:46.685 --> 02:35:48.513
This is uncharted territory for me.

02:35:48.513 --> 02:35:51.813
LIAM: Believe me, if I could be a casting T-Rex, I would be.

02:35:51.813 --> 02:35:52.646
TRAVIS: Yeah, that makes sense.

02:35:52.646 --> 02:35:55.645
MATT: And that would be terrifying.

02:35:55.645 --> 02:35:57.528
I would throw that at you every game.

02:35:57.528 --> 02:35:59.167
MARISHA: Play a druid.

02:35:59.167 --> 02:36:00.316
MATT: All right. So.

02:36:00.316 --> 02:36:03.850
MARISHA: Get to level 20 and play a druid.

02:36:03.850 --> 02:36:06.919
MATT: As you guys are all making your way through the water,

02:36:06.919 --> 02:36:08.859
the dark, freezing depths below,

02:36:08.859 --> 02:36:10.905
your feet now immediately numb

02:36:10.905 --> 02:36:12.550
within the first 30 seconds or so

02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:15.533
of skidding across the surface.

02:36:15.533 --> 02:36:16.639
SAM: Oh no!

02:36:16.639 --> 02:36:20.316
Is that a small iceberg in front of us, Beau,

02:36:20.316 --> 02:36:22.406
shaped like a ramp?!

02:36:22.406 --> 02:36:23.823
(laughter)

02:36:23.823 --> 02:36:25.764
MARISHA: Oh no, I think it is.

02:36:25.764 --> 02:36:27.674
Hold on tight.

02:36:27.674 --> 02:36:28.799
Whoa!

02:36:28.799 --> 02:36:31.602
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me.
MARISHA: And then we do a barrel roll. Okay.

02:36:31.602 --> 02:36:33.051
TRAVIS: Do a barrel roll.

02:36:33.051 --> 02:36:34.444
MARISHA: Do a barrel roll!

02:36:34.444 --> 02:36:37.333
ASHLEY: I make sure to swim a little bit to like--

02:36:37.333 --> 02:36:39.922
MATT: Help give a little rush to it? You got it, you got it.

02:36:39.922 --> 02:36:40.755
MARISHA: 20.

02:36:40.755 --> 02:36:41.588
MATT: 20.

02:36:41.588 --> 02:36:45.370
As you skid off of this side, the water spraying up a bit,

02:36:45.370 --> 02:36:47.578
you manage to just find the incline

02:36:47.578 --> 02:36:49.906
of this one slightly akimbo ice shelf

02:36:49.906 --> 02:36:53.131
and you go leaping at a full angle and land,

02:36:53.131 --> 02:36:55.992
doing a complete barrel roll off the edge of the ice

02:36:55.992 --> 02:36:58.116
and catch it there, still holding onto Veth.

02:36:58.116 --> 02:36:59.386
MARISHA: Radical.
LIAM: Officially--

02:36:59.386 --> 02:37:01.100
SAM: Totally tubular!

02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:02.281
(laughter)

02:37:02.281 --> 02:37:04.864
LIAM: Officially jumping the shark, Critical Role is.

02:37:05.851 --> 02:37:09.603
ASHLEY: I shout a whale (barking), or whatever they do.

02:37:09.603 --> 02:37:10.436
TRAVIS: What was that?

02:37:10.436 --> 02:37:15.325
TRAVIS: What does your killer whale sound like?! (yodeling)

02:37:15.325 --> 02:37:16.158
Oh no!

02:37:16.158 --> 02:37:18.353
MATT: Is that a baby grizzly?
LIAM: Was that foley? (wheezy barking)

02:37:18.353 --> 02:37:22.661
MATT: All right, so you did give a few rounds to this.

02:37:23.884 --> 02:37:26.741
So keeping tabs, the first round is 120 feet.

02:37:26.741 --> 02:37:28.976
So I would like to have the orcas

02:37:28.976 --> 02:37:30.042
to make a perception check.

02:37:30.042 --> 02:37:32.194
LIAM: And we've split, right? Like a Y.

02:37:32.194 --> 02:37:35.947
MATT: Yes, you guys have gone into this trio,

02:37:35.947 --> 02:37:37.331
this trident formation

02:37:37.331 --> 02:37:38.822
to cover the most ground.

02:37:38.822 --> 02:37:40.255
LIAM: Advantage perception.

02:37:40.255 --> 02:37:43.523
LAURA: Can I look, too, since I'm underwater?

02:37:43.523 --> 02:37:44.766
MATT: You can with disadvantage.

02:37:44.766 --> 02:37:45.599
LAURA: Okay.

02:37:46.762 --> 02:37:47.595
TRAVIS: 13.

02:37:50.194 --> 02:37:51.508
ASHLEY: 15.

02:37:51.508 --> 02:37:52.466
LIAM: 12.

02:37:52.466 --> 02:37:53.899
MATT: 12.

02:37:53.899 --> 02:37:55.611
Nothing yet.
TRAVIS: We don't have advantage, right?

02:37:55.611 --> 02:37:58.256
Not as orcas. Orcas don't get advantage, right, just you?

02:37:58.256 --> 02:38:01.698
MATT: You are having no luck seeing any sign or trace

02:38:01.698 --> 02:38:04.479
of an entity or your quarry.

02:38:04.479 --> 02:38:06.042
You do rush past and see a couple of shapes for a moment,

02:38:06.042 --> 02:38:07.807
but you see it's just a small cluster of seals

02:38:07.807 --> 02:38:09.999
that just dart away from you as fast as they can

02:38:09.999 --> 02:38:11.739
at your arrival.

02:38:11.739 --> 02:38:14.038
SAM: The seal sound, Ashley?

02:38:14.038 --> 02:38:15.154
ASHLEY: Wait, what do seals--?

02:38:15.154 --> 02:38:17.129
SAM: (laughs)

02:38:17.129 --> 02:38:18.329
ASHLEY: (weak scream)

02:38:18.329 --> 02:38:19.162
I don't know.

02:38:19.162 --> 02:38:20.190
(laughter)

02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:21.482
MATT: There you go.
ASHLEY: Trying to find it.

02:38:21.482 --> 02:38:22.406
I don't know.

02:38:22.406 --> 02:38:27.370
(laughter)

02:38:27.370 --> 02:38:31.578
TRAVIS: That was a space ship taking off
with all four rocket boosters imploding.

02:38:31.578 --> 02:38:32.477
ASHLEY: (seal barking)

02:38:32.477 --> 02:38:33.446
ALL: 'Ey!

02:38:33.446 --> 02:38:35.133
ASHLEY: There it is.

02:38:35.133 --> 02:38:37.382
MATT: Continuing onward,

02:38:37.382 --> 02:38:39.596
you are staying close to the surface,

02:38:39.596 --> 02:38:43.159
currently, to keep these people here, right?

02:38:43.159 --> 02:38:46.654
So, moving to the 240 foot mark.

02:38:46.654 --> 02:38:48.054
TRAVIS: 240 foot.
MATT: Right.

02:38:48.054 --> 02:38:50.622
LAURA: But you can dive down, you don't have anybody on you.

02:38:50.622 --> 02:38:51.455
TRAVIS: No.

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:53.995
SAM: I'm going to make my way to the top of Beau.

02:38:53.995 --> 02:38:54.828
MATT: Okay.

02:38:54.828 --> 02:38:58.864
SAM: Onto her shoulders standing, and just like--

02:38:58.864 --> 02:39:00.854
LAURA: Caduceus, can we dive under?

02:39:00.854 --> 02:39:03.597
TALIESIN: Oh god, I don't want to, but-- ugh.

02:39:03.597 --> 02:39:05.327
MATT: She can't talk. You can't...

02:39:05.327 --> 02:39:06.204
SAM: I'll put my leg up.

02:39:06.204 --> 02:39:07.229
MATT: Oh wait, wait, no, you can, you're holding on,

02:39:07.229 --> 02:39:08.420
you're holding on, sorry.

02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:09.422
MARISHA: Yes. Yes.

02:39:09.422 --> 02:39:11.355
LIAM: Wait, Caduceus is on which whale?

02:39:11.355 --> 02:39:13.070
MATT: On you.
LIAM: On with us?

02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:14.320
Okay.

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:16.710
Yeah, the creamsicle whale dives.

02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:17.935
MATT: Okay.

02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:20.505
You watch as Caduceus and Jester--

02:39:20.505 --> 02:39:21.546
(zwoop)
LAURA: Ahh!

02:39:21.546 --> 02:39:23.021
MATT: -- beneath the water.

02:39:24.872 --> 02:39:26.105
All righty.

02:39:26.105 --> 02:39:29.398
I'd like a perception check from all three whales, please.

02:39:29.398 --> 02:39:31.588
And then for both of you, perception checks

02:39:31.588 --> 02:39:32.421
with disadvantage.

02:39:32.421 --> 02:39:33.929
LIAM: New dice.
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

02:39:33.929 --> 02:39:35.445
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:39:35.445 --> 02:39:36.932
MATT: With disadvantage?
LAURA: Oh, fuck me.

02:39:36.932 --> 02:39:38.299
LIAM: Natural 20!

02:39:38.299 --> 02:39:39.538
(cheering)

02:39:39.538 --> 02:39:40.538
MATT: Nice.
TALIESIN: 28.

02:39:41.473 --> 02:39:43.686
LIAM: I rolled a 19 and a 20 with advantage.

02:39:43.686 --> 02:39:44.805
MATT: With disadvantage for you?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:39:44.805 --> 02:39:46.478
MATT: That's great.
TALIESIN: 28 with disadvantage.

02:39:46.478 --> 02:39:47.606
TRAVIS: 11.
MATT: 11.

02:39:47.606 --> 02:39:49.226
LAURA: 21 with disadvantage.

02:39:49.226 --> 02:39:50.059
LIAM: It's so pretty.

02:39:50.059 --> 02:39:51.190
TALIESIN: 26 with disadvantage, I'm sorry.

02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:53.271
SAM: I'm going to roll, too, for the surface.

02:39:53.271 --> 02:39:54.270
Maybe we'll see something on the surface.

02:39:54.270 --> 02:39:55.539
MARISHA: Yeah, same.

02:39:55.539 --> 02:39:57.414
SAM: I got a four.
MARISHA: I got...

02:39:58.505 --> 02:39:59.338
a three.

02:39:59.338 --> 02:40:00.744
(laughter)

02:40:00.744 --> 02:40:02.960
But we look amazing.

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:06.128
MATT: In fact, that's what you
guys are focused on right now.

02:40:06.128 --> 02:40:07.916
The adrenaline's still pumping from that landing.

02:40:07.916 --> 02:40:08.987
It's pretty slick.

02:40:08.987 --> 02:40:13.323
MARISHA: I just prop my-- and then do a full lift.

02:40:13.323 --> 02:40:15.348
SAM: And I'll transfer so my hands are on her head.

02:40:15.348 --> 02:40:16.998
MARISHA: Okay, perfect. Yeah.

02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:19.406
MARISHA: And one-handed.

02:40:19.406 --> 02:40:20.290
SAM: Oh, one hand?

02:40:20.290 --> 02:40:22.260
MARISHA: Yeah, man.

02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:23.885
And nailed it.

02:40:23.885 --> 02:40:25.018
MATT: Nice.

02:40:25.018 --> 02:40:26.364
Okay.

02:40:26.364 --> 02:40:30.152
So, you don't see a sign of anything yet.

02:40:30.152 --> 02:40:31.168
(groaning)

02:40:31.168 --> 02:40:32.285
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

02:40:33.432 --> 02:40:35.116
MATT: Even with the natural 20, there's nothing

02:40:35.116 --> 02:40:39.022
within your visual range here that catches your attention.

02:40:39.022 --> 02:40:41.439
We move on to the next round.

02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:44.332
LAURA: She's 500 feet.
MARISHA: That's it.

02:40:44.332 --> 02:40:45.895
LAURA: 500 feet.
MARISHA: How do you beat that?

02:40:45.895 --> 02:40:48.225
LAURA: She can't swim as fast as we can.

02:40:48.225 --> 02:40:49.552
MATT: Just because you roll really high

02:40:49.552 --> 02:40:51.520
doesn't mean that you can see miles away

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:53.192
or anything at this distance.

02:40:53.192 --> 02:40:56.214
It's a higher roll and proximity and location.

02:40:56.214 --> 02:40:58.288
So I'm keeping track of a lot, all like a matrix here.

02:40:58.288 --> 02:41:01.615
LIAM: I could have gotten the 19
and 20 in the wrong direction.

02:41:01.615 --> 02:41:05.103
SAM: Yes, we also could be swimming in the wrong direction.

02:41:05.103 --> 02:41:06.190
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: No idea.

02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:07.546
MATT: Also depends on, you know, surface and depth.

02:41:07.546 --> 02:41:09.843
There's a lot of factors here.

02:41:09.843 --> 02:41:11.434
And trio...

02:41:11.434 --> 02:41:12.855
ASHLEY: Polymorph is an hour?
LIAM: An hour.

02:41:12.855 --> 02:41:13.946
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
MATT: All right.

02:41:13.946 --> 02:41:14.779
So, yeah.

02:41:14.779 --> 02:41:16.926
So now with you guys diving beneath the surface

02:41:16.926 --> 02:41:19.291
and you, are you diving as well or are you staying--

02:41:19.291 --> 02:41:20.283
TRAVIS: 60 feet under the surface.

02:41:20.283 --> 02:41:21.307
MATT: 60 feet under the surface?

02:41:21.307 --> 02:41:23.864
How deep are you, Caleb?

02:41:23.864 --> 02:41:24.834
LIAM: How deep is my love?

02:41:24.834 --> 02:41:25.991
Like 100 feet down.

02:41:25.991 --> 02:41:27.230
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: 100 feet?

02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:29.216
TRAVIS: You'll lose visibility-
LAURA: That's terrible.

02:41:29.216 --> 02:41:30.141
LIAM: Why?

02:41:30.141 --> 02:41:32.093
LAURA: Because it's very dark down there,

02:41:32.093 --> 02:41:33.452
speaking from a scuba diver.

02:41:33.452 --> 02:41:35.402
LIAM: I'm using hearing.

02:41:35.402 --> 02:41:37.060
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:39.597
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Protection From Energy on myself

02:41:39.597 --> 02:41:41.040
while we're rolling.

02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:41.999
MATT: Good call.

02:41:41.999 --> 02:41:43.514
On cold, I imagine?
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:41:43.514 --> 02:41:45.133
MATT: The icy depths do not affect you negatively.

02:41:45.133 --> 02:41:45.966
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:41:45.966 --> 02:41:48.023
MATT: They were about to, but you're good.

02:41:48.023 --> 02:41:49.048
Okay.

02:41:50.535 --> 02:41:52.423
You watch, as you guys are holding on,

02:41:52.423 --> 02:41:54.954
Caduceus pulls one hand up and does

02:41:54.954 --> 02:41:57.578
like a slight undulating motion with his wrist,

02:41:57.578 --> 02:41:59.552
brings it back to his chest and there's this burst

02:41:59.552 --> 02:42:01.847
of cold energy around his torso that drifts off

02:42:01.847 --> 02:42:04.677
and you now see, as icy water seems

02:42:04.677 --> 02:42:06.743
to almost drift away from him in a forward impact,

02:42:06.743 --> 02:42:07.910
which is nice.

02:42:09.073 --> 02:42:11.932
All right, perception checks from all of you

02:42:11.932 --> 02:42:13.599
beneath the surface.

02:42:14.863 --> 02:42:16.253
You guys can make checks if you want.

02:42:16.253 --> 02:42:18.461
MARISHA: Yeah, why not?
TALIESIN: 16.

02:42:18.461 --> 02:42:19.378
MATT: 16, okay.

02:42:20.662 --> 02:42:21.919
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:42:21.919 --> 02:42:23.418
MATT: Again?
TALIESIN: Whoa.

02:42:23.418 --> 02:42:25.219
LIAM: A one and a 20 this time.

02:42:25.219 --> 02:42:27.320
TRAVIS: Nice.
MARISHA: A natural one.

02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:28.487
SAM: I got a six.

02:42:29.389 --> 02:42:30.222
TRAVIS: Five.
ASHLEY: 12.

02:42:30.222 --> 02:42:32.342
SAM: We're talking about costumes now.

02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:33.175
MATT: Five?
LAURA: 15.

02:42:33.175 --> 02:42:34.383
MATT: 15, got it.

02:42:34.383 --> 02:42:35.550
MARISHA: Like flames?

02:42:36.767 --> 02:42:38.956
I'm in ice and you are in flames.

02:42:38.956 --> 02:42:39.948
SAM: Fire and ice?

02:42:39.948 --> 02:42:41.580
Perfect.
MARISHA: It's great.

02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:43.383
MATT: Okay.

02:42:43.383 --> 02:42:44.216
Caleb.

02:42:45.207 --> 02:42:49.907
You hear thrashing, faintly in the water,

02:42:51.330 --> 02:42:53.744
loosely in the direction you are traveling,

02:42:53.744 --> 02:42:56.215
though you can't pinpoint it, but you do get the essence

02:42:56.215 --> 02:43:01.142
that there is something also swimming a ways ahead of you.

02:43:01.142 --> 02:43:02.428
LIAM: Okay.

02:43:02.428 --> 02:43:07.428
I go (whale call) and replicate
what I learned from Star Trek.

02:43:07.476 --> 02:43:09.060
That old Star Trek movie.
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:12.237
LIAM: Yep. (whale calls)

02:43:12.237 --> 02:43:13.391
TRAVIS: San Francisco Bay, man.

02:43:13.391 --> 02:43:14.797
TALIESIN: The Search for See-Through Aluminum.

02:43:14.797 --> 02:43:16.580
LIAM: And call the other whales.

02:43:16.580 --> 02:43:18.510
TRAVIS: (whale call)

02:43:18.510 --> 02:43:19.968
LIAM: Move over, cows.

02:43:21.183 --> 02:43:23.064
TALIESIN: Whales are the new cows.
TRAVIS: Sea cows.

02:43:23.064 --> 02:43:24.955
MATT: The direction that you hear it from

02:43:24.955 --> 02:43:28.342
is a little bit upward, and it crosses

02:43:28.342 --> 02:43:32.709
with the path that Fjord is currently pursuing.

02:43:33.810 --> 02:43:35.726
LIAM: I'll try to course correct as I continue

02:43:35.726 --> 02:43:36.627
to stream forward.

02:43:36.627 --> 02:43:37.667
MATT: All right.

02:43:37.667 --> 02:43:38.966
So moving on to the next--

02:43:38.966 --> 02:43:41.499
LIAM: And I moo that out.

02:43:41.499 --> 02:43:42.499
(whale call)

02:43:46.494 --> 02:43:49.511
MATT: Continuing to push forward.

02:43:49.511 --> 02:43:50.702
Everyone make another perception check.

02:43:50.702 --> 02:43:52.653
LIAM: Come on, universe. Give me another one.

02:43:55.948 --> 02:43:57.467
TALIESIN: Double one!
LIAM: Average.

02:43:57.467 --> 02:43:58.870
LAURA: Two and three.

02:43:58.870 --> 02:44:01.628
MATT: Nice, clerics bringing up the rear.

02:44:01.628 --> 02:44:03.323
SAM: I got a 19.

02:44:03.323 --> 02:44:04.925
MARISHA: I got a four.

02:44:04.925 --> 02:44:06.144
TALIESIN: My eyes were closed.

02:44:06.144 --> 02:44:07.915
ASHLEY: 17.
LIAM: 14.

02:44:07.915 --> 02:44:08.748
MATT: 17.

02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:12.430
TRAVIS: Five.
MATT: Okay.

02:44:12.430 --> 02:44:14.247
LIAM: (whale calls)

02:44:14.247 --> 02:44:17.964
MATT: You you heard what Caleb had disseminated

02:44:17.964 --> 02:44:20.918
throughout the water, though you do not understand.

02:44:20.918 --> 02:44:21.751
Well, no, you are one of the whales,

02:44:21.751 --> 02:44:24.683
so you pick up on what he's saying,

02:44:24.683 --> 02:44:26.785
but you're all still losing it.

02:44:26.785 --> 02:44:28.835
Like it's becoming hard to follow.

02:44:28.835 --> 02:44:31.523
You're still at quite a distance from whatever this is,

02:44:31.523 --> 02:44:34.923
and you're starting to lose the trail a bit.

02:44:34.923 --> 02:44:36.669
But you recall the direction you were traveling,

02:44:36.669 --> 02:44:38.740
and you continue push that way in hopes that

02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:41.355
you haven't been noticed or you can alter your path.

02:44:41.355 --> 02:44:42.475
What would you like to do?

02:44:42.475 --> 02:44:44.110
LIAM: I will stop mooing in the water,

02:44:44.110 --> 02:44:45.787
but go in the same direction.

02:44:45.787 --> 02:44:46.620
MATT: Okay.

02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:48.078
LIAM: Dragging the clerics as I go.

02:44:48.078 --> 02:44:50.465
MATT: Same?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:44:50.465 --> 02:44:51.810
MATT: Are you continuing to fan out,

02:44:51.810 --> 02:44:53.716
or are you beginning to converge with Fjord and Caleb?

02:44:53.716 --> 02:44:55.542
ASHLEY: So you've been communicating.

02:44:55.542 --> 02:44:59.924
LIAM: I just now mooed out this way.

02:44:59.924 --> 02:45:01.683
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: "Follow me,"

02:45:01.683 --> 02:45:03.192
and then I stopped talking.

02:45:03.192 --> 02:45:05.158
ASHLEY: I'm going to start making my way--

02:45:05.158 --> 02:45:07.499
♪ Making my way to Caleb. ♪

02:45:08.703 --> 02:45:10.306
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Swimming over.

02:45:10.306 --> 02:45:12.568
Also putting the tail out, making it look pretty

02:45:12.568 --> 02:45:14.768
to add to the show.

02:45:14.768 --> 02:45:16.593
MATT: You got it, all right.
MARISHA: We got a fountain going.

02:45:16.593 --> 02:45:17.601
SAM: Nice.
MARISHA: It's great.

02:45:17.601 --> 02:45:19.537
MATT: Are you joining with this?

02:45:19.537 --> 02:45:20.655
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:45:20.655 --> 02:45:22.457
So you guys are beginning to slowly

02:45:22.457 --> 02:45:25.127
bring your fanning pattern back together,

02:45:25.127 --> 02:45:28.160
moving on for another batch here.

02:45:30.306 --> 02:45:32.365
This is interesting, okay.

02:45:32.365 --> 02:45:34.564
Continuing to push forward, keeping down

02:45:34.564 --> 02:45:37.724
in this darker, 70 or so foot depth.

02:45:37.724 --> 02:45:39.724
What little bit of light is coming through the clouds

02:45:39.724 --> 02:45:41.720
and the storm above is helping give a little bit

02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:44.119
of visibility to those of you who are relying on sight.

02:45:44.119 --> 02:45:45.643
However, the rest of you, the hearing,

02:45:45.643 --> 02:45:47.924
it's very unique being underwater.

02:45:47.924 --> 02:45:50.409
It's an odd sense of having awareness

02:45:50.409 --> 02:45:52.110
of much more space than what you're used to

02:45:52.110 --> 02:45:54.723
and picking up just shifting movement and sound

02:45:54.723 --> 02:45:57.447
and elements, and being able to understand

02:45:57.447 --> 02:46:02.081
a vague idea of the vicinity.

02:46:02.081 --> 02:46:03.729
It's unique.

02:46:03.729 --> 02:46:05.497
And hopefully it will be enough.

02:46:05.497 --> 02:46:07.881
So I would need everyone here to go ahead

02:46:07.881 --> 02:46:09.411
and roll perception again. Once again,

02:46:09.411 --> 02:46:12.510
disadvantage for those of you who are not whales.

02:46:12.510 --> 02:46:14.950
LAURA: I'm going to guide you, Caleb.

02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:16.961
LIAM: Okay. Said it.
TALIESIN: 20.

02:46:16.961 --> 02:46:18.142
LIAM: And that's a d4?
TALIESIN: 14.

02:46:18.142 --> 02:46:18.975
MATT: 14.

02:46:20.678 --> 02:46:23.270
MARISHA: It's actually okay this time.
SAM: 19 on the surface again.

02:46:23.270 --> 02:46:26.118
MARISHA: 20 on the surface this time.

02:46:26.118 --> 02:46:28.060
MATT: Though your visibility is shitty,

02:46:28.060 --> 02:46:30.572
and since you're convening to join them,

02:46:30.572 --> 02:46:33.369
you guys are keeping out, and you see in the distance,

02:46:33.369 --> 02:46:35.013
more heavier ice floes.

02:46:35.013 --> 02:46:37.155
In fact, the path you're heading right now

02:46:37.155 --> 02:46:38.926
looks to be a very clustered path

02:46:38.926 --> 02:46:40.207
of jagged, broken ice shelves.

02:46:40.207 --> 02:46:41.156
SAM: Oh god.

02:46:41.156 --> 02:46:42.631
MATT: And right as you realize this--

02:46:42.631 --> 02:46:43.464
SAM: Oh god.

02:46:43.464 --> 02:46:46.388
MATT: The rope pulls you underwater.

02:46:46.388 --> 02:46:47.221
MARISHA: Hold your breath!

02:46:47.221 --> 02:46:51.537
SAM: Well, we can't, we've got Water Walk on.

02:46:51.537 --> 02:46:53.595
LIAM: You can drop it if you choose.

02:46:53.595 --> 02:46:55.374
MATT: You can choose to drop it if you want to.

02:46:55.374 --> 02:46:56.292
TALIESIN: No, you can just drop it.

02:46:56.292 --> 02:46:57.811
LAURA: You've got a ring on, though.

02:46:57.811 --> 02:47:01.179
SAM: He has to-- it's his.
LIAM: Matt said that the person with it on--

02:47:01.179 --> 02:47:04.052
MARISHA: Does it force you from going underwater?

02:47:04.052 --> 02:47:05.733
Is it more like a life vest?

02:47:05.733 --> 02:47:06.864
TALIESIN: No, it makes you buoyant.

02:47:06.864 --> 02:47:08.606
MATT: It makes you buoyant.

02:47:08.606 --> 02:47:10.997
It's less about the, you cannot break the surface.

02:47:10.997 --> 02:47:12.818
It's just you're resisting it.

02:47:12.818 --> 02:47:15.521
Which would be tough if you're being dragged

02:47:15.521 --> 02:47:18.118
through the water by an orca. It would slow her down.

02:47:18.118 --> 02:47:21.126
MARISHA: Can I grab Veth and try and, like,

02:47:21.126 --> 02:47:24.943
MARISHA: Can I grab Veth and try and, like,

02:47:24.943 --> 02:47:27.880
do some monk shit and maneuver around it

02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:30.873
and like pop pop pop pop pop over top of it?

02:47:30.873 --> 02:47:33.212
MATT: How long is the rope you have?

02:47:33.212 --> 02:47:34.789
MARISHA: 30 feet-ish, I guess-

02:47:34.789 --> 02:47:38.290
MATT: She is now going 60 feet underwater.

02:47:38.290 --> 02:47:39.812
So either you have to hold onto the rope

02:47:39.812 --> 02:47:42.148
and go under the water with her or let go

02:47:42.148 --> 02:47:44.236
and try and run across the surface and the ice above.

02:47:44.236 --> 02:47:45.486
It's your call.

02:47:48.043 --> 02:47:52.042
SAM: What if we let go, run across,

02:47:52.042 --> 02:47:53.326
and then on the other side,

02:47:53.326 --> 02:47:55.314
we'll rejoin with her.

02:47:55.314 --> 02:47:56.147
No.

02:47:57.605 --> 02:48:01.973
MARISHA: Because I can, if it's a 30-foot rope,

02:48:01.973 --> 02:48:04.988
we're not necessarily at the end of the rope.

02:48:04.988 --> 02:48:07.155
My dash speed is 100 feet.

02:48:08.277 --> 02:48:10.776
Unless you want to hold your breath.

02:48:10.776 --> 02:48:12.251
SAM: Can I even go under the water?

02:48:12.251 --> 02:48:13.400
I'm wearing a ring of water walking.

02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:14.906
ASHLEY: You have underwater breathing.

02:48:14.906 --> 02:48:16.401
MATT: In the same regard, if you wanted to will it

02:48:16.401 --> 02:48:19.422
to go under there, you could let the effect subside.

02:48:19.422 --> 02:48:21.087
LAURA: Just go under-fucking-water.

02:48:21.087 --> 02:48:22.694
Everybody can breathe.
SAM: Go underwater.

02:48:22.694 --> 02:48:26.830
MARISHA: Okay, I clutch onto Veth for added protection.

02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:27.958
MATT: All right, and in that moment,

02:48:27.958 --> 02:48:30.694
that moment of choose top or, you know,

02:48:30.694 --> 02:48:34.750
to go top route or underneath, you make the choice,

02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:36.528
and instinctually take a deep breath,

02:48:36.528 --> 02:48:39.038
though it will not matter before you both plunge

02:48:39.038 --> 02:48:39.871
beneath the surface.

02:48:39.871 --> 02:48:41.015
MARISHA: All right, good to know.

02:48:41.015 --> 02:48:42.197
MATT: All right.

02:48:42.197 --> 02:48:43.593
perception checks?

02:48:43.593 --> 02:48:45.723
LAURA: Oh yeah, we all rolled.
MATT: Yes.

02:48:45.723 --> 02:48:46.981
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:48:46.981 --> 02:48:48.622
19.
LAURA: 19.

02:48:48.622 --> 02:48:49.539
LIAM: Dirty 20.

02:48:50.823 --> 02:48:53.084
SAM: Mine was 19 on the surface.
MATT: Right.

02:48:53.084 --> 02:48:54.546
ASHLEY: Seven.

02:48:54.546 --> 02:48:55.379
TALIESIN: 14.

02:48:55.379 --> 02:48:56.379
MARISHA: 20.
MATT: All right.

02:48:58.172 --> 02:48:59.876
And now for you guys, perception checks with disadvantage,

02:48:59.876 --> 02:49:02.276
as a note, now that you're under the water.

02:49:02.276 --> 02:49:05.407
You're picking up that sound of thrashing again.

02:49:05.407 --> 02:49:08.337
You still can't quite pinpoint the specific direction,

02:49:08.337 --> 02:49:11.368
but you know it's loosely in front of you.

02:49:11.368 --> 02:49:14.067
You feel like you're on the tail of it, to a degree.

02:49:14.067 --> 02:49:16.836
If you can maintain some semblance of the same rolls,

02:49:16.836 --> 02:49:18.538
you'll continue to hone in on it.

02:49:18.538 --> 02:49:21.178
If you don't, you'll begin to lose it.

02:49:21.178 --> 02:49:23.178
So that brings us to...

02:49:27.831 --> 02:49:31.338
You are slowly gaining at the moment.

02:49:31.338 --> 02:49:32.229
Both...

02:49:34.547 --> 02:49:36.522
Veth and Beauregard.

02:49:37.422 --> 02:49:39.542
Both take six points of cold damage

02:49:39.542 --> 02:49:41.360
from the impact of the icy waters

02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:44.908
that you've been dragged underneath.

02:49:44.908 --> 02:49:48.313
The rest of you, make your perception checks.

02:49:48.313 --> 02:49:49.832
Well, you guys as well, make your perception checks

02:49:49.832 --> 02:49:52.182
but with disadvantage if you're not a whale.

02:49:55.279 --> 02:49:56.556
SAM: One.
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:49:56.556 --> 02:49:58.811
TALIESIN: Another natural 20 that I get to burn, 16.

02:49:58.811 --> 02:49:59.937
MARISHA: Natural one.

02:49:59.937 --> 02:50:00.953
SAM: Oh boy.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:50:00.953 --> 02:50:01.786
ASHLEY: 21.

02:50:01.786 --> 02:50:03.291
MATT: 21. Nice.

02:50:03.291 --> 02:50:04.932
SAM: It's darker under here.
LIAM: 16.

02:50:04.932 --> 02:50:05.790
MATT: 16.

02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:06.907
LAURA: Fail.
MARISHA: So fucking cold.

02:50:06.907 --> 02:50:07.915
TRAVIS: 19.

02:50:07.915 --> 02:50:08.748
MATT: 19.

02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:13.007
All of you begin to lose the thrashing sound

02:50:13.007 --> 02:50:15.078
except for Yasha.

02:50:15.078 --> 02:50:16.529
Yasha, you can pick up on it,

02:50:16.529 --> 02:50:18.028
and as you're honing in on it,

02:50:18.028 --> 02:50:20.466
you begin to see the intent and the drive

02:50:20.466 --> 02:50:23.220
from Yasha swimming and pulling you guys along

02:50:23.220 --> 02:50:24.869
into the water beneath.

02:50:24.869 --> 02:50:27.837
It's beginning to dive a bit, and you watch Yasha

02:50:27.837 --> 02:50:31.189
beginning to go into a deeper trajectory,

02:50:31.189 --> 02:50:33.266
and you all can adjust with her, if you'd like.

02:50:33.266 --> 02:50:35.149
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: I call out, too.

02:50:35.149 --> 02:50:38.198
(whale call)
TRAVIS: (whale call)

02:50:39.131 --> 02:50:40.078
MATT: I live for this.

02:50:40.078 --> 02:50:42.518
LIAM: (creaking)
MATT: Okay.

02:50:42.518 --> 02:50:43.693
LIAM: (creaking)

02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:47.571
TRAVIS: Well, they do make those clicking sounds and stuff.

02:50:47.571 --> 02:50:48.504
MATT: All right.

02:50:48.504 --> 02:50:50.387
You're feeling like you're getting closer.

02:50:50.387 --> 02:50:52.475
You're beginning to push more and more in that direction,

02:50:52.475 --> 02:50:55.148
as it gets deeper and deeper, the light begins to subside,

02:50:55.148 --> 02:50:59.227
and the two of you, you can barely see anything.

02:50:59.227 --> 02:51:01.434
You can hear things better than you can see them almost,

02:51:01.434 --> 02:51:04.051
and the depths are freezing cold.

02:51:04.051 --> 02:51:06.781
You both take four points of cold damage.

02:51:07.889 --> 02:51:09.715
TALIESIN: You did take your 15 positive

02:51:09.715 --> 02:51:11.599
before we left the boat, right?

02:51:11.599 --> 02:51:12.532
MARISHA: No, I did not.

02:51:12.532 --> 02:51:13.603
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: I did.

02:51:13.603 --> 02:51:15.042
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:51:15.042 --> 02:51:16.743
MARISHA: Before we left the boat?

02:51:16.743 --> 02:51:17.903
MATT: He did a Mass Cure Wounds.

02:51:17.903 --> 02:51:19.943
Everybody did heal 15 before you left.

02:51:19.943 --> 02:51:20.785
MARISHA: That helps.

02:51:20.785 --> 02:51:21.618
LIAM: How long have we been swimming for,

02:51:21.618 --> 02:51:23.373
like 10, 15, 20 minutes or something?

02:51:23.373 --> 02:51:24.713
30 minutes?

02:51:24.713 --> 02:51:26.740
MATT: At this point, it would be about, no, no,

02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:27.885
I'm going round by round by round here.

02:51:27.885 --> 02:51:28.923
LIAM: Round by round, got it.

02:51:28.923 --> 02:51:31.521
MATT: Because this is a distance travel,

02:51:31.521 --> 02:51:34.603
this is a you either win quickly or you lose quickly.

02:51:34.603 --> 02:51:35.436
LIAM: Okay.

02:51:36.463 --> 02:51:39.008
MATT: So you are now in round seven.

02:51:39.008 --> 02:51:40.602
SAM: Are we still rolling?

02:51:40.602 --> 02:51:43.073
We're still going at 120 feet per second?

02:51:43.073 --> 02:51:43.906
MATT: Exactly.

02:51:43.906 --> 02:51:45.640
SAM: Because we're using...

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:46.807
LAURA: Double double.

02:51:46.807 --> 02:51:47.640
LIAM: Whale speed, dash.

02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:49.057
MATT: Yeah, whale speed with a dash.

02:51:49.057 --> 02:51:50.582
SAM: Doesn't that take an action?

02:51:50.582 --> 02:51:52.726
MATT: It does.
LIAM: Yeah. Nobody's attacking.

02:51:52.726 --> 02:51:54.947
SAM: But I mean, we're also rolling perception?

02:51:54.947 --> 02:51:57.305
MATT: For this, it's just keeping an eye out and hearing.

02:51:57.305 --> 02:51:59.769
This is more of just as you're swimming hard,

02:51:59.769 --> 02:52:01.241
you're just listening out for it.

02:52:01.241 --> 02:52:03.745
LIAM: Yeah, it's different than investigation.

02:52:03.745 --> 02:52:05.602
MATT: So perception checks for the whales,

02:52:05.602 --> 02:52:06.718
and perception checks for those who are underwater.

02:52:06.718 --> 02:52:08.663
SAM: ♪ Perception checks for the whales ♪

02:52:11.371 --> 02:52:13.160
TRAVIS: Ooh.
LIAM: Dirty 20.

02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:14.514
MATT: Dirty 20?

02:52:14.514 --> 02:52:15.638
TRAVIS: 20.
MATT: 20.

02:52:15.638 --> 02:52:16.846
LAURA: Did you take it?
ASHLEY: 22.

02:52:16.846 --> 02:52:17.898
LIAM: Did you give it to me?

02:52:17.898 --> 02:52:18.801
LAURA: I didn't.
LIAM: No, I didn't.

02:52:18.801 --> 02:52:20.309
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: 23.

02:52:21.152 --> 02:52:22.127
MARISHA: 21.

02:52:22.127 --> 02:52:23.539
SAM: Ooh.

02:52:23.539 --> 02:52:24.956
MATT: That's a good round.

02:52:24.956 --> 02:52:26.912
MARISHA: With disadvantage.

02:52:26.912 --> 02:52:27.778
LAURA: 19.

02:52:27.778 --> 02:52:28.943
MATT: That's a very good round.

02:52:28.943 --> 02:52:30.065
SAM: 11.

02:52:30.065 --> 02:52:31.790
MATT: All of you begin to pick up the sound

02:52:31.790 --> 02:52:33.957
of swimming and thrashing.

02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:39.473
It is from a smaller source than the whales,

02:52:39.473 --> 02:52:43.807
and it begins to shift, like it's reacting

02:52:44.721 --> 02:52:47.746
to your presence,

02:52:48.609 --> 02:52:53.601
and is thrashing faster and with more intent.

02:52:55.304 --> 02:52:58.050
Let's go ahead and move to the next round.

02:52:58.050 --> 02:52:59.883
SAM: This is a thing.

02:53:07.885 --> 02:53:09.434
TRAVIS: How much time has transpired, roughly?

02:53:09.434 --> 02:53:10.471
LIAM: Forming an emotional bond.

02:53:10.471 --> 02:53:12.954
MATT: You're under a minute.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:53:12.954 --> 02:53:14.260
LIAM: Did really well.

02:53:14.260 --> 02:53:16.892
MARISHA: Another round of perception?
MATT: Another round of perception, yeah.

02:53:16.892 --> 02:53:18.053
LAURA: Ooh!

02:53:18.053 --> 02:53:19.127
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:53:19.127 --> 02:53:19.960
LAURA: 25.

02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:21.005
TRAVIS: No fucking way.
MATT: Damn!

02:53:21.005 --> 02:53:22.063
TRAVIS: Three of them? Wow!

02:53:22.063 --> 02:53:23.358
MATT: You have rolled some 20s tonight.

02:53:23.358 --> 02:53:26.181
LIAM: These are my dice. I'm never giving them up!

02:53:26.181 --> 02:53:27.428
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:53:27.428 --> 02:53:28.994
LIAM: Oh shit!

02:53:31.009 --> 02:53:31.842
MATT: Okay.

02:53:31.842 --> 02:53:32.727
ASHLEY: 13.

02:53:32.727 --> 02:53:34.279
MATT: 13.

02:53:34.279 --> 02:53:35.178
MARISHA: 11.

02:53:35.178 --> 02:53:36.697
SAM: Nine.
TALIESIN: 25.

02:53:36.697 --> 02:53:37.701
MATT: Okay.

02:53:37.701 --> 02:53:40.422
That's more than half over 20.

02:53:41.389 --> 02:53:44.184
You begin to make out from the source,

02:53:44.184 --> 02:53:49.058
and it is now diving deeper into the lightless depths below.

02:53:49.058 --> 02:53:54.058
But you see a humanoid figure, currently swimming its way

02:53:54.155 --> 02:53:55.907
beneath the waters.

02:53:55.907 --> 02:53:57.472
LAURA: How far away?

02:53:57.472 --> 02:54:01.272
MATT: At the moment, it is 80 feet away from you.

02:54:02.485 --> 02:54:03.996
SAM: Just a single human figure?

02:54:03.996 --> 02:54:05.125
MATT: Single humanoid figure.

02:54:05.125 --> 02:54:06.432
SAM: Whoa.

02:54:06.432 --> 02:54:09.345
LAURA: I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt.

02:54:09.345 --> 02:54:11.218
At 3rd-level.

02:54:11.218 --> 02:54:12.674
MATT: Right now? Okay.

02:54:12.674 --> 02:54:16.688
Go ahead, roll for attack with disadvantage.

02:54:16.688 --> 02:54:17.588
LAURA: Is that okay?
MARISHA: Do it.

02:54:17.588 --> 02:54:18.666
Yeah, highlights her.

02:54:18.666 --> 02:54:20.333
LIAM: Yeah, love it.

02:54:20.333 --> 02:54:21.519
Come on, cowgirl, get it.

02:54:21.519 --> 02:54:23.443
LAURA: Damn it. Damn it.

02:54:23.443 --> 02:54:24.951
No, that's 12.

02:54:24.951 --> 02:54:27.069
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately.

02:54:27.069 --> 02:54:28.701
It streaks by, but you all watch

02:54:28.701 --> 02:54:32.549
as this bead of bright light, like a firing flare

02:54:32.549 --> 02:54:34.811
of divine energy, just streaks into the depths below,

02:54:34.811 --> 02:54:36.287
and as it does, for a split second,

02:54:36.287 --> 02:54:39.203
you see the darkened, shadowed outline

02:54:39.203 --> 02:54:41.460
of what you assume is Avantika,

02:54:41.460 --> 02:54:43.782
ducking out, dodging out of the way,

02:54:43.782 --> 02:54:48.782
looking over and seeing this rapidly gaining

02:54:48.990 --> 02:54:50.765
pod of whales

02:54:50.765 --> 02:54:55.084
and the hitchhikers that currently clutch to the ropes

02:54:55.084 --> 02:54:57.710
making their way, bearing down upon her.

02:54:57.710 --> 02:54:59.511
LIAM: You miss, but that's a fucking great visual.

02:54:59.511 --> 02:55:00.905
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, it really is.

02:55:00.905 --> 02:55:03.373
MATT: So, going into the next round.

02:55:03.373 --> 02:55:04.348
ASHLEY: Some light.

02:55:08.959 --> 02:55:10.160
MARISHA: This is crazy.

02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:13.188
SAM: Matty, do we take another set of cold damage?

02:55:13.188 --> 02:55:14.021
MATT: You do.

02:55:15.085 --> 02:55:16.252
Take three cold damage.

02:55:16.252 --> 02:55:17.399
SAM: Yay.

02:55:17.399 --> 02:55:19.944
TALIESIN: How you guys holding up?

02:55:19.944 --> 02:55:21.792
MARISHA: Fine.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:55:21.792 --> 02:55:22.625
MARISHA: About half for me.

02:55:22.625 --> 02:55:23.724
SAM: Me, too.

02:55:23.724 --> 02:55:26.321
MATT: You are 20 feet from her.

02:55:26.321 --> 02:55:28.844
LAURA: (gasps) 20 feet from her.

02:55:28.844 --> 02:55:30.054
SAM: We can eat her.

02:55:30.054 --> 02:55:32.106
TRAVIS: I can.
LIAM: Feeding frenzy.

02:55:32.106 --> 02:55:33.585
TRAVIS: Can I use--

02:55:33.585 --> 02:55:34.418
MARISHA: Do it.

02:55:34.418 --> 02:55:36.604
TRAVIS: Can use my Relentless Hex as a bonus action

02:55:36.604 --> 02:55:39.947
to magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space

02:55:39.947 --> 02:55:41.988
you can see within five feet of the target

02:55:41.988 --> 02:55:43.679
cursed by your Hex spell?
LIAM: You have to drop your whale.

02:55:43.679 --> 02:55:45.645
MATT: I will say, for the purposes of this

02:55:45.645 --> 02:55:47.975
and how the Hex is attuned to you,

02:55:47.975 --> 02:55:51.225
you would have to drop your whale form.

02:55:53.948 --> 02:55:55.763
MARISHA and LAURA: You don't have any hitchhikers.

02:55:55.763 --> 02:55:57.066
LIAM: Yeah, you're an underwater dude.

02:55:57.066 --> 02:55:59.416
It's kind of cool.

02:55:59.416 --> 02:56:00.721
TRAVIS: I'll drop it.

02:56:00.721 --> 02:56:01.554
MATT: Okay.

02:56:01.554 --> 02:56:04.878
You watch as one of the whale forms

02:56:04.878 --> 02:56:07.697
vanishes, and a secondary dark shadow

02:56:07.697 --> 02:56:11.579
of the captain, Fjord Stone, dives forth.

02:56:11.579 --> 02:56:15.079
And then in a flash, you see just a few bubbles

02:56:15.079 --> 02:56:17.123
left behind and he's gone. As Avantika

02:56:17.123 --> 02:56:20.540
is diving down, suddenly in front of her,

02:56:21.479 --> 02:56:24.031
you appear, the blade glowing like this

02:56:24.031 --> 02:56:25.428
underwater torchlight

02:56:25.428 --> 02:56:26.395
TRAVIS: Can I take two swings?

02:56:26.395 --> 02:56:27.244
MATT: You can.

02:56:27.244 --> 02:56:29.140
LAURA: Oh shit!
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:30.223
LAURA: Get her!

02:56:31.703 --> 02:56:33.870
ASHLEY: I love this game.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:56:36.027 --> 02:56:38.463
TRAVIS: That's 21 to hit.

02:56:38.463 --> 02:56:39.704
MATT: 21 misses.

02:56:39.704 --> 02:56:40.559
(groaning)

02:56:40.559 --> 02:56:42.001
LIAM: She's badass!

02:56:42.001 --> 02:56:42.834
TRAVIS: She is.

02:56:46.215 --> 02:56:48.555
That's 17 plus 12 is--

02:56:48.555 --> 02:56:49.388
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: Oh.

02:56:49.388 --> 02:56:50.881
TRAVIS: 29.
MATT: That hits.

02:56:50.881 --> 02:56:52.655
Go ahead and roll damage on her.

02:56:52.655 --> 02:56:53.813
ASHLEY: Come on.

02:56:58.196 --> 02:56:59.481
TRAVIS: 10--

02:56:59.481 --> 02:57:01.884
(counting)

02:57:01.884 --> 02:57:05.617
24 points of force damage.

02:57:07.359 --> 02:57:08.258
MATT: From?

02:57:08.258 --> 02:57:09.446
TRAVIS: One slash.

02:57:09.446 --> 02:57:10.946
MATT: One slash, nice.

02:57:12.515 --> 02:57:13.348
All right.

02:57:15.066 --> 02:57:17.720
So she gets struck in the side.

02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:19.714
As her mouth opens, no bubbles emerge.

02:57:19.714 --> 02:57:21.898
She doesn't breathe air at the moment.

02:57:21.898 --> 02:57:22.731
TRAVIS: Shocker.

02:57:24.671 --> 02:57:27.109
MATT: She's going to use her reaction to do Hungry Swipe.

02:57:27.109 --> 02:57:30.695
She's going to strike at you out with the dagger.

02:57:30.695 --> 02:57:34.328
And that dagger is going to be a

02:57:34.328 --> 02:57:35.752
21 to hit.

02:57:35.752 --> 02:57:36.856
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:57:36.856 --> 02:57:39.414
I will roll with my Armor of Hexes.

02:57:39.414 --> 02:57:41.273
MATT: Your armor-- oh no, that's still lasting.

02:57:41.273 --> 02:57:42.911
TRAVIS: And it's a four, so it misses.

02:57:42.911 --> 02:57:43.744
MATT: Let's see here.

02:57:43.744 --> 02:57:47.128
Well, this is the ninth round, and you cast the Hex-

02:57:47.128 --> 02:57:49.863
TRAVIS: Oh, that does last a
certain amount of time, doesn't it?

02:57:49.863 --> 02:57:51.608
MATT: It lasts for 10 rounds, so it would not,

02:57:51.608 --> 02:57:54.167
so we'll say for the purposes of this,

02:57:54.167 --> 02:57:55.385
this is the last round it'll happen.

02:57:55.385 --> 02:57:57.128
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: We'll say it's the last round that you have a Hex.

02:57:57.128 --> 02:57:57.961
TRAVIS: Okay

02:57:58.866 --> 02:57:59.699
(exhales)

02:57:59.699 --> 02:58:00.571
MATT: So it misses.

02:58:00.571 --> 02:58:02.778
The dagger swings wide,

02:58:02.778 --> 02:58:05.531
and at that point, the shadows dissipate from her body.

02:58:05.531 --> 02:58:07.172
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
MATT: The hex is no longer there.

02:58:07.172 --> 02:58:08.345
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:58:08.345 --> 02:58:10.496
MATT: But you are both swimming in tandem now

02:58:10.496 --> 02:58:12.185
while you're both striking at each other

02:58:12.185 --> 02:58:15.037
as she's still trying to push away.

02:58:15.037 --> 02:58:19.075
So, the next round, the whales will catch up.

02:58:19.075 --> 02:58:22.618
Because she does not swim as fast as orcas.

02:58:22.618 --> 02:58:23.668
So.
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame?

02:58:23.668 --> 02:58:24.701
Yeah, we'll wait till--

02:58:24.701 --> 02:58:26.936
MATT: For the purposes of this, let's go ahead and roll,

02:58:26.936 --> 02:58:27.936
we don't need a battlefield here,

02:58:27.936 --> 02:58:29.003
but we can roll initiative to see

02:58:29.003 --> 02:58:30.771
what order people are going in.

02:58:30.771 --> 02:58:32.147
MARISHA: A brand new initiative?

02:58:32.147 --> 02:58:33.335
MATT: Brand new initiative.

02:58:33.335 --> 02:58:34.767
TALIESIN: Hmm.

02:58:34.767 --> 02:58:35.961
LAURA: Hmm.

02:58:35.961 --> 02:58:37.700
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:39.127
Natural 20.

02:58:39.127 --> 02:58:40.449
MATT: Okay.

02:58:40.449 --> 02:58:43.057
MARISHA: So 25 total for Beau.

02:58:43.057 --> 02:58:44.057
MATT: All right.

02:58:45.441 --> 02:58:46.692
LAURA: Natural one.

02:58:46.692 --> 02:58:47.545
SAM: Yeah.

02:58:47.545 --> 02:58:50.415
LAURA: So five total for Jester.

02:58:50.415 --> 02:58:51.248
MATT: There you go.

02:58:51.248 --> 02:58:53.332
MARISHA: That natural 20 on literally

02:58:53.332 --> 02:58:56.163
any other thing this game.

02:58:56.163 --> 02:58:59.413
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20, we got Beau.

02:59:01.441 --> 02:59:02.675
20 to 15?

02:59:02.675 --> 02:59:04.042
LIAM: 17.
TALIESIN: 17.

02:59:04.042 --> 02:59:05.031
ASHLEY: 18.

02:59:05.031 --> 02:59:05.864
LAURA: Ooh.

02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:14.130
MATT: All right, then we have Caduceus and Caleb.

02:59:15.756 --> 02:59:17.214
15 to 10?

02:59:17.214 --> 02:59:18.047
SAM: 14.

02:59:21.114 --> 02:59:22.197
MATT: 10 to five?

02:59:23.689 --> 02:59:24.966
LAURA: Five.

02:59:24.966 --> 02:59:26.594
Did you roll, Fjord?
TRAVIS: I did.

02:59:26.594 --> 02:59:27.427
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Ooh.

02:59:27.427 --> 02:59:28.388
MATT: What'd you get?

02:59:28.388 --> 02:59:29.626
TRAVIS: Four.
SAM: Ooh.

02:59:29.626 --> 02:59:30.739
TRAVIS: No, two.

02:59:30.739 --> 02:59:31.993
SAM: Ooh!

02:59:31.993 --> 02:59:33.634
MATT: There you go.

02:59:33.634 --> 02:59:35.971
All right, Beau, you're up first.

02:59:36.912 --> 02:59:39.728
MARISHA: Okay.

02:59:43.676 --> 02:59:47.844
I guess I'm going to yank on the rope

02:59:47.844 --> 02:59:52.235
and run along the back of Yasha whale,

02:59:53.367 --> 02:59:58.367
and then I'm going to kick off of Yasha whale's nose,

02:59:58.794 --> 03:00:02.888
do a forward flip, and then get to her, 50 feet of movement.

03:00:02.888 --> 03:00:04.512
MATT: 50 feet of movement halved, because you're underwater,

03:00:04.512 --> 03:00:05.570
so it's 25.

03:00:05.570 --> 03:00:08.911
You were 20 feet from her, so you can get there.

03:00:08.911 --> 03:00:09.744
MARISHA: So I can get there.

03:00:09.744 --> 03:00:11.068
MATT: Because you're following them, so you can get there.

03:00:11.068 --> 03:00:12.950
MARISHA: Okay, and I use a little bit of the current

03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:14.248
from Yasha whale as she-

03:00:14.248 --> 03:00:16.132
MATT: You torpedo Beau towards--

03:00:16.132 --> 03:00:16.965
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Go for it.

03:00:16.965 --> 03:00:17.882
TALIESIN: Headbutt.

03:00:18.898 --> 03:00:19.956
MARISHA: That sounds fun.

03:00:19.956 --> 03:00:22.871
I'm going to torpedo Beau headbutt.

03:00:22.871 --> 03:00:26.255
TRAVIS: Do you slow down as you get there and like (thunk)?

03:00:26.255 --> 03:00:28.858
MATT: I just envision Robin Williams in the Popeye movie

03:00:28.858 --> 03:00:32.770
when he torpedo-Popeyes into the octopus at the end.

03:00:32.770 --> 03:00:34.070
There you go.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:00:35.358 --> 03:00:38.260
MARISHA: I bonk her her a little bit, but then I do

03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:40.866
the five-inch punch, and then--

03:00:40.866 --> 03:00:42.545
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: I think it's a one-inch punch.

03:00:42.545 --> 03:00:43.745
MATT: Roll your attacks. Your attacks all have--

03:00:43.745 --> 03:00:45.570
MARISHA: One-inch punch, whatever.
SAM: It's five times as good.

03:00:45.570 --> 03:00:48.331
MATT: Your attacks are all disadvantage

03:00:48.331 --> 03:00:49.419
because you are underwater.

03:00:49.419 --> 03:00:50.712
MARISHA: Disadvantage.

03:00:50.712 --> 03:00:52.962
All right, so first attack.

03:00:54.317 --> 03:00:55.327
22?

03:00:55.327 --> 03:00:56.443
MATT: 22 misses.

03:00:56.443 --> 03:00:58.976
MARISHA: 22 misses.

03:00:58.976 --> 03:01:00.840
Second attack.

03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:02.101
Misses.

03:01:02.101 --> 03:01:02.934
TALIESIN: 22.

03:01:02.934 --> 03:01:05.465
MATT: You go in, about to touch, and you one-inch punch,

03:01:05.465 --> 03:01:07.261
and she just darts out of the way.

03:01:07.261 --> 03:01:08.836
She's pretty comfortable under the water.

03:01:08.836 --> 03:01:09.902
And you go for a second strike,

03:01:09.902 --> 03:01:12.411
and she moves out of the way again.

03:01:12.411 --> 03:01:13.368
You get your bonus.

03:01:13.368 --> 03:01:16.077
MARISHA: Fucking irritated.

03:01:16.939 --> 03:01:18.207
Flurry of Blows.

03:01:18.207 --> 03:01:20.102
MATT: You're not the only dodge tank in the world.

03:01:20.102 --> 03:01:21.598
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:01:21.598 --> 03:01:26.478
I'm just going to resort to bar brawl 18-year old Beau

03:01:26.478 --> 03:01:30.315
and start clawing and try and grab at her coat.

03:01:30.315 --> 03:01:31.718
MATT: You got it.

03:01:31.718 --> 03:01:35.671
MARISHA: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Ah!

03:01:35.671 --> 03:01:37.446
Oh, oh, yay, okay.

03:01:39.656 --> 03:01:40.489
27?

03:01:40.489 --> 03:01:41.322
MATT: 27 hits.

03:01:42.679 --> 03:01:44.912
MARISHA: Yeah, I grab her hoops.

03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:51.139
15?

03:01:51.139 --> 03:01:52.504
MATT: 15 damage, or to hit?

03:01:52.504 --> 03:01:54.091
MARISHA: 15 damage.
MATT: Okay, continue.

03:01:54.091 --> 03:01:55.664
MARISHA: On that first one.
MATT: You got it.

03:01:55.664 --> 03:01:56.497
All right.

03:01:57.948 --> 03:02:00.203
MARISHA: Next one, disadvantage.

03:02:00.203 --> 03:02:01.794
No, that's a one and a six.

03:02:01.794 --> 03:02:03.468
MATT: Okay, you do get one hit off.

03:02:03.468 --> 03:02:04.782
You hit her off in the temple.

03:02:04.782 --> 03:02:05.912
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

03:02:05.912 --> 03:02:07.462
MATT: You know she's immune to stunning.

03:02:07.462 --> 03:02:10.130
MARISHA: She's immune to stunning,
I know she's immune to stunning.

03:02:10.130 --> 03:02:12.182
MATT: I will allow you to not spend that point

03:02:12.182 --> 03:02:13.369
because you would know.

03:02:13.369 --> 03:02:15.695
MARISHA: I know that already.

03:02:15.695 --> 03:02:19.025
I pull her hair, feels like all I got.

03:02:19.025 --> 03:02:20.616
MATT: Sure, it comes free.

03:02:20.616 --> 03:02:21.906
ALL: (groaning)

03:02:21.906 --> 03:02:23.614
MATT: With relative ease.

03:02:23.614 --> 03:02:25.201
ALL: Ew!

03:02:25.201 --> 03:02:26.809
MATT: Her hat is gone and there is now

03:02:26.809 --> 03:02:29.484
a chunk of exposed skull where you tugged at it.

03:02:29.484 --> 03:02:33.189
MARISHA: A little bit of a flesh and bone attached to it?
MATT: Yeah.

03:02:33.189 --> 03:02:34.594
MARISHA: That's cool.

03:02:34.594 --> 03:02:36.661
MATT: All righty. That finishes Beau's go, Yasha,

03:02:36.661 --> 03:02:39.866
you are going simultaneously with Avantika.

03:02:39.866 --> 03:02:41.699
What's your dexterity?

03:02:43.150 --> 03:02:43.983
ASHLEY: 16.

03:02:43.983 --> 03:02:46.294
MATT: I will say Avantika actually
goes a little bit before you.

03:02:46.294 --> 03:02:47.643
ASHLEY: That's fine.

03:02:47.643 --> 03:02:49.093
MATT: So.
ASHLEY: Ladies first.

03:02:50.608 --> 03:02:55.317
MATT: In proximity with Beau and Fjord,

03:02:56.602 --> 03:02:58.926
Fjord's going to be the source of her frustration.

03:02:58.926 --> 03:03:00.075
Even though you just pulled her hair out.

03:03:00.075 --> 03:03:01.673
She's like, "Whatever."

03:03:01.673 --> 03:03:04.721
You're the one that she has some history to deal with.

03:03:04.721 --> 03:03:05.698
TRAVIS: Just a little bit.

03:03:05.698 --> 03:03:07.118
MATT: So after the hair tugs off a bit,

03:03:07.118 --> 03:03:10.189
her head snaps in your direction

03:03:10.189 --> 03:03:13.350
with a horrible whipping and clicking into position.

03:03:13.350 --> 03:03:16.340
The head still tilted to one side, the eyes still glowing

03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:18.675
with that odd yellow, the pupil isn't even visible now.

03:03:18.675 --> 03:03:20.026
You just see these yellow glow,

03:03:20.026 --> 03:03:22.674
the same glow you recall from any dreams you had

03:03:22.674 --> 03:03:24.824
with Uk'otoa over the past year.

03:03:24.824 --> 03:03:26.009
SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

03:03:26.009 --> 03:03:30.033
MATT: The rapier comes out to
strike at you with the first strike.

03:03:30.033 --> 03:03:32.680
That is going to an 18 to hit?

03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:35.192
TRAVIS: It hits.
MATT: It hits.

03:03:35.192 --> 03:03:40.192
With that, the rapier does 14 points

03:03:40.192 --> 03:03:41.516
of piercing damage to you.

03:03:41.516 --> 03:03:43.614
TRAVIS: Okay, 14.

03:03:43.614 --> 03:03:46.232
As it strikes you, the blood (pfff) out there,

03:03:46.232 --> 03:03:48.739
and you feel this cold sensation in the wound,

03:03:48.739 --> 03:03:52.348
and you watch this dull glow down the rapier,

03:03:52.348 --> 03:03:54.738
like it pulled energy out of you.

03:03:54.738 --> 03:03:55.821
TALIESIN: Ah, fucker.

03:03:57.325 --> 03:03:59.464
MATT: The glow goes into her

03:03:59.464 --> 03:04:02.343
and she's pulsing within her torso ever so gently.

03:04:02.343 --> 03:04:04.467
She's going to now strike with the dagger as her offhand

03:04:04.467 --> 03:04:06.698
before she goes in for the secondary rapier attack.

03:04:06.698 --> 03:04:09.847
So the dagger strike is going to be 20 to hit.

03:04:09.847 --> 03:04:10.888
TRAVIS: Hits.

03:04:11.867 --> 03:04:15.317
MATT: You take 10 points of piercing damage.

03:04:17.335 --> 03:04:20.335
And as the dagger cuts through your midsection,

03:04:20.335 --> 03:04:22.444
necrotic energy suddenly pierces into the wound

03:04:22.444 --> 03:04:26.176
that it leaves behind, dealing in additional 11 points

03:04:26.176 --> 03:04:28.336
of necrotic damage to you.

03:04:28.336 --> 03:04:29.720
And she pulls back with the rapier

03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:31.173
for now her third and final strike,

03:04:31.173 --> 03:04:35.273
and goes to pierce you a third time.

03:04:35.273 --> 03:04:38.179
Oh, that is a 30 to hit.

03:04:38.179 --> 03:04:39.985
TRAVIS: I think it hits.
TALIESIN: Jesus.

03:04:39.985 --> 03:04:41.184
TRAVIS: Think it hit.

03:04:41.184 --> 03:04:44.600
MATT: You take 16 points of piercing damage.

03:04:45.773 --> 03:04:49.397
And as the blade sticks into you,

03:04:49.397 --> 03:04:51.420
that glow that she pulled out of you

03:04:51.420 --> 03:04:53.834
charges through the arm, through the rapier,

03:04:53.834 --> 03:04:57.893
and into the wound, and then bursts on the inside.

03:04:57.893 --> 03:05:00.053
You feel this horrible burning sensation,

03:05:00.053 --> 03:05:03.651
like a portion of your soul is being charred on the inside,

03:05:03.651 --> 03:05:07.082
as she uses her Soul Burn ability.

03:05:07.082 --> 03:05:08.290
TRAVIS: Soul Burn.

03:05:09.209 --> 03:05:10.937
MATT: She seems to be able to draw out elements

03:05:10.937 --> 03:05:14.661
of somebody's soul and then redirect it.

03:05:14.661 --> 03:05:17.166
So you take from that...

03:05:17.166 --> 03:05:20.198
TRAVIS: It's me, soul, don't hurt me.

03:05:20.198 --> 03:05:21.865
LAURA: You know me, soul.

03:05:23.869 --> 03:05:25.077
TRAVIS: Soul knows the way.

03:05:25.077 --> 03:05:26.600
MATT: 28 points in necrotic damage.

03:05:26.600 --> 03:05:28.355
TRAVIS: Wow!

03:05:28.355 --> 03:05:30.272
TALIESIN: How you doing, buddy?

03:05:32.720 --> 03:05:33.888
MATT: And she's going to continue--

03:05:33.888 --> 03:05:36.059
she's going to stay put, because she's currently now

03:05:36.059 --> 03:05:39.669
in a defensive position between the two of you,

03:05:39.669 --> 03:05:42.272
and it starting to feel a little confident on

03:05:42.272 --> 03:05:44.708
now that she's brought you into her favored terrain,

03:05:44.708 --> 03:05:45.636
if you will.

03:05:45.636 --> 03:05:47.308
All right, that's going to finish Avantika's go.

03:05:47.308 --> 03:05:48.141
Yasha, you're up.

03:05:48.141 --> 03:05:49.808
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: As a whale.

03:05:52.743 --> 03:05:56.670
ASHLEY: Can I just try to go chomp on her?

03:05:56.670 --> 03:05:58.582
MATT: Yeah, go for it!
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:05:58.582 --> 03:06:01.053
Do I just-- it's a--
LIAM: Attack roll.

03:06:01.053 --> 03:06:02.361
You could either try to damage her

03:06:02.361 --> 03:06:04.953
or choose instead to grapple her.

03:06:04.953 --> 03:06:06.620
ASHLEY: Yeah, I want to...

03:06:09.581 --> 03:06:10.822
MATT: Your call.

03:06:12.113 --> 03:06:14.980
ASHLEY: I mean, I want to do damage and grapple.

03:06:18.315 --> 03:06:20.438
But it's just one attack because it's a whale?

03:06:20.438 --> 03:06:21.271
MATT: Yeah.

03:06:21.271 --> 03:06:22.532
You get one attack. It's a bite.

03:06:22.532 --> 03:06:23.365
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:06:23.365 --> 03:06:25.191
So I'm just going to bite and hold her down.

03:06:25.191 --> 03:06:26.068
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and roll an attack

03:06:26.068 --> 03:06:29.090
and six to the attack roll.

03:06:29.090 --> 03:06:30.665
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: Wait.

03:06:32.581 --> 03:06:35.664
Yeah, go ahead. No, I'm sorry, sorry.
I'm doing math in my head.

03:06:37.723 --> 03:06:39.549
ASHLEY: 20 total.
MATT: 20 total.

03:06:39.549 --> 03:06:40.719
Unfortunately, as you swing by,

03:06:40.719 --> 03:06:43.293
she just ducks beneath and skids across the blubber

03:06:43.293 --> 03:06:45.362
as you dive and curl around,

03:06:45.362 --> 03:06:48.399
unable to find purchase with your teeth.

03:06:48.399 --> 03:06:49.901
TRAVIS: 17 or higher.

03:06:49.901 --> 03:06:52.181
TALIESIN: Well, 22 misses on her.

03:06:52.181 --> 03:06:53.897
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:06:53.897 --> 03:06:55.682
TALIESIN: Killer whales aren't going to do shit.

03:06:55.682 --> 03:06:56.686
MATT: Unless you roll really high. I don't know.

03:06:56.686 --> 03:06:57.552
TALIESIN: Unless we roll really high.

03:06:57.552 --> 03:06:58.660
MATT: All right, that finishes Yasha's go.

03:06:58.660 --> 03:07:00.237
Caduceus and Caleb, you're up.

03:07:00.237 --> 03:07:02.737
TRAVIS: Natural dice roll of 17 or higher. Maybe.

03:07:03.841 --> 03:07:04.674
TALIESIN: You can go first.

03:07:04.674 --> 03:07:06.565
LIAM: I'm just going to try to bite her and hurt her.

03:07:06.565 --> 03:07:08.271
Long shot.

03:07:08.271 --> 03:07:09.754
23

03:07:09.754 --> 03:07:11.539
MATT: 23 does hit.

03:07:11.539 --> 03:07:13.465
Roll damage on that.

03:07:13.465 --> 03:07:15.512
That just hits.

03:07:15.512 --> 03:07:17.638
MARISHA: Wow. Okay.

03:07:17.638 --> 03:07:19.160
LIAM: 24 points of piercing damage.

03:07:19.160 --> 03:07:20.153
SAM: Whoa.

03:07:20.153 --> 03:07:21.115
MATT: Nice.

03:07:21.115 --> 03:07:23.424
So, as she ducks out of the way of Yasha

03:07:23.424 --> 03:07:26.075
swishing by, she prepares herself to focus

03:07:26.075 --> 03:07:27.576
between the dueling stance

03:07:27.576 --> 03:07:31.040
of between Beauregard and Fjord.

03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:32.859
And without realizing, she looks down just in time

03:07:32.859 --> 03:07:36.490
to see this giant angry orca maw come up from beneath

03:07:36.490 --> 03:07:38.128
and close on her leg.

03:07:38.128 --> 03:07:40.203
She pushes off and kicks out of your mouth.

03:07:40.203 --> 03:07:41.894
But she does, there's a stream of dark

03:07:41.894 --> 03:07:44.611
liquid, long coagulated blood now released

03:07:44.611 --> 03:07:46.765
into the water around her, leaving a dark cloud

03:07:46.765 --> 03:07:48.332
around the outside of her torso

03:07:48.332 --> 03:07:50.903
LIAM: ♪ Fanta, Fanta, don't you want a ♪

03:07:50.903 --> 03:07:51.869
MATT: All righty.

03:07:51.869 --> 03:07:53.987
That finishes Caleb's go.

03:07:53.987 --> 03:07:55.309
Caduceus?

03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:56.767
TALIESIN: I'm keeping a little bit of distance.

03:07:56.767 --> 03:07:58.241
Just like, not a ton of distance,

03:07:58.241 --> 03:08:02.015
but I'm going to Sacred Flame at this point.

03:08:02.015 --> 03:08:03.598
MATT: Okay, you got it.

03:08:04.495 --> 03:08:05.328
What's the same on that?

03:08:05.328 --> 03:08:06.263
TALIESIN: It's a dex save.

03:08:06.263 --> 03:08:08.773
MATT: Dex save. She's good at those.

03:08:08.773 --> 03:08:10.639
That is a 27.
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

03:08:10.639 --> 03:08:11.472
Okay, good to know.

03:08:11.472 --> 03:08:12.906
MATT: All right, so as you release Sacred Flame,

03:08:12.906 --> 03:08:16.917
it flares, but where it flares, she's suddenly not there.

03:08:16.917 --> 03:08:19.083
It seems like the spell itself--

03:08:19.083 --> 03:08:21.266
she almost seems to deflect the spell

03:08:21.266 --> 03:08:24.378
and use that deflection energy to vanish

03:08:24.378 --> 03:08:27.845
from her spot and teleport 30 feet towards you.

03:08:27.845 --> 03:08:29.157
TALIESIN: Did that actually work?

03:08:29.157 --> 03:08:31.073
MATT: It did.
TALIESIN: So she's no longer grappled?

03:08:31.073 --> 03:08:32.054
MATT: She's no longer grappled.

03:08:32.054 --> 03:08:32.887
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:08:32.887 --> 03:08:34.343
MATT: Well, I don't think she was grappled previously.

03:08:34.343 --> 03:08:35.176
TALIESIN: Oh, she was just bit.

03:08:35.176 --> 03:08:36.009
MATT: She was just bit.

03:08:36.009 --> 03:08:37.967
TALIESIN: Oh.
MATT: But suddenly, she vanishes.

03:08:37.967 --> 03:08:39.711
TALIESIN: Still 30 feet away from me.

03:08:39.711 --> 03:08:41.672
MATT: Seems that directed spells, she has

03:08:41.672 --> 03:08:42.863
another trick up her sleeve.

03:08:42.863 --> 03:08:44.236
TALIESIN: Cool to know.

03:08:44.236 --> 03:08:46.295
MATT: So now she's pretty close to you.

03:08:46.295 --> 03:08:48.266
Within a short distance, she can get to you.

03:08:48.266 --> 03:08:50.619
All right, that finishes your go, Caduceus.

03:08:50.619 --> 03:08:53.169
Veth, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.

03:08:53.169 --> 03:08:54.506
LAURA: Wait, what did she just do?

03:08:54.506 --> 03:08:55.825
SAM: So where she--

03:08:55.825 --> 03:08:57.726
TALIESIN: She teleported 30 feet towards me

03:08:57.726 --> 03:08:59.270
because I did a direct spell.

03:08:59.270 --> 03:09:01.103
MATT: He did a spell towards her, the flame burst.

03:09:01.103 --> 03:09:03.843
And as it did is she almost seemed to push it to the side

03:09:03.843 --> 03:09:06.930
and then vanish and then appear 30 feet closer to Caduceus.

03:09:06.930 --> 03:09:08.088
LAURA: Oh wow.

03:09:08.984 --> 03:09:11.595
SAM: So how far is she from <i>moi</i>?

03:09:11.595 --> 03:09:13.283
MATT: From you?

03:09:13.283 --> 03:09:17.562
Since you were riding by, holding on to Beauregard

03:09:17.562 --> 03:09:19.736
and dropped behind. If you were holding onto the rope still.

03:09:19.736 --> 03:09:23.456
You could have let go and be within 50 feet of her.

03:09:23.456 --> 03:09:24.289
SAM: Okay.

03:09:25.565 --> 03:09:26.482
Boy oh boy.

03:09:27.702 --> 03:09:29.682
SAM: This is so confusing.

03:09:29.682 --> 03:09:33.192
MATT: Also, Beauregard and Veth,

03:09:33.192 --> 03:09:34.479
you both take six points of cold damage.

03:09:34.479 --> 03:09:36.775
SAM: Okay, great, great, great.

03:09:40.602 --> 03:09:41.962
Not so much I can do.

03:09:41.962 --> 03:09:43.692
Is she engaged with anyone?

03:09:43.692 --> 03:09:45.074
MATT: At the moment, no, she teleported away.

03:09:45.074 --> 03:09:46.224
SAM: Damn it.

03:09:48.903 --> 03:09:51.452
And it's pointless to shoot a crossbow at her.

03:09:51.452 --> 03:09:52.672
I mean, it's not pointless.

03:09:52.672 --> 03:09:54.809
LIAM: She's not up at Caddy right now?

03:09:54.809 --> 03:09:58.075
LAURA: She's 30 feet away from him.
LIAM: 30 feet from Caddy, got it.

03:09:58.075 --> 03:10:00.506
MATT: And 30 feet away from you.
SAM: I've got nowhere to hide.

03:10:00.506 --> 03:10:02.402
I'll do the same fucking thing again.

03:10:02.402 --> 03:10:05.212
I will cast Phantasmal Force at her.

03:10:05.212 --> 03:10:06.862
MATT: Okay, and it is intelligence, right?

03:10:06.862 --> 03:10:07.695
SAM: Yes.

03:10:09.142 --> 03:10:10.202
MATT: That is a natural one.

03:10:10.202 --> 03:10:11.649
LAURA: Ah, thank you!

03:10:11.649 --> 03:10:12.482
SAM: Okay.

03:10:12.482 --> 03:10:13.890
Uh.

03:10:13.890 --> 03:10:15.082
Mm-hmm.

03:10:15.082 --> 03:10:16.923
I didn't expect that to work.

03:10:16.923 --> 03:10:18.582
(laughter)

03:10:18.582 --> 03:10:21.115
Fjord's holding his sword, right?

03:10:21.115 --> 03:10:21.948
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:10:21.948 --> 03:10:25.664
SAM: Okay, I will, through force of...

03:10:26.539 --> 03:10:27.872
my charisma-- no,

03:10:27.872 --> 03:10:32.765
I will make her believe that Fjord's sword is the orb.

03:10:35.152 --> 03:10:35.985
MATT: Okay.

03:10:35.985 --> 03:10:38.521
LAURA: Ooh, like he stole it away
from her when they were fighting?

03:10:38.521 --> 03:10:41.490
MATT: Okay, so as she darts towards Caduceus

03:10:41.490 --> 03:10:44.152
and takes stock of the vicinity

03:10:44.152 --> 03:10:47.312
she glances back towards you and her face goes (gasps) wide.

03:10:47.312 --> 03:10:50.262
Suddenly she glances towards her belt and back towards you.

03:10:52.002 --> 03:10:53.243
Okay, that's your turn.

03:10:53.243 --> 03:10:54.925
SAM: That's it, that's all I got.
MATT: You got it.

03:10:54.925 --> 03:10:57.182
All right, that brings us to Jester.

03:10:57.182 --> 03:10:58.772
Fjord, you're on deck.

03:10:58.772 --> 03:11:00.972
LAURA: What does what does Phantasmal Force do?

03:11:00.972 --> 03:11:03.592
SAM: It makes her believe something.

03:11:03.592 --> 03:11:05.445
LAURA: It's not like a charm spell, where if I attack her

03:11:05.445 --> 03:11:08.022
it's going to to break the illusion?
SAM: No.

03:11:08.022 --> 03:11:09.230
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:11:10.872 --> 03:11:11.962
SAM: Huh?

03:11:11.962 --> 03:11:14.342
TALIESIN: Paying attention to some shit.
All right, making plan, sorry.

03:11:14.342 --> 03:11:17.402
LIAM: She just sicced Avantika back on Fjord essentially.

03:11:17.402 --> 03:11:18.915
LAURA: Right.
MATT: Yeah.

03:11:18.915 --> 03:11:22.662
LAURA: And how far away am I from everybody?

03:11:22.662 --> 03:11:25.052
I guess I was holding onto Caleb, so I'm up with--

03:11:25.052 --> 03:11:26.627
MATT: You're holding onto Caleb.

03:11:26.627 --> 03:11:28.969
You're, right now, I'd say, about 40 feet from Avantika

03:11:28.969 --> 03:11:30.262
and you guys are all pretty clustered

03:11:30.262 --> 03:11:32.122
in this little orb that was around her

03:11:32.122 --> 03:11:34.132
before she teleported out.

03:11:34.132 --> 03:11:36.505
LAURA: Okay, so I can't get to <i>her</i>.

03:11:39.072 --> 03:11:40.347
How's everybody doing?

03:11:42.322 --> 03:11:45.228
SAM: (underwater noises) It's cold down here.

03:11:52.012 --> 03:11:54.320
LAURA: I'm going to-- (squeals)

03:11:56.683 --> 03:11:59.516
(exhales)

03:12:00.942 --> 03:12:02.742
SAM: Is this how hard it is for you to heal someone?

03:12:02.742 --> 03:12:03.875
LAURA: Yeah.

03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:09.022
(exhaling)

03:12:09.022 --> 03:12:12.232
LAURA: I am going to...
SAM: You will cast Healing Word.

03:12:13.072 --> 03:12:15.716
TRAVIS: Each new opportunity is a chance to not fuck up.

03:12:15.716 --> 03:12:17.192
And it sucks for you, too.

03:12:19.712 --> 03:12:20.818
I've been doing it all day.

03:12:20.818 --> 03:12:24.613
LAURA: I can't, I can't use my--
it's my 7th-level spell!

03:12:26.252 --> 03:12:29.332
Are we that low on health?

03:12:29.332 --> 03:12:30.402
TRAVIS: No, not yet.

03:12:30.402 --> 03:12:32.072
LAURA: Okay, then I'm not going to do it.

03:12:32.072 --> 03:12:33.020
LIAM: Orca power.

03:12:33.020 --> 03:12:35.305
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to just 3rd-level...

03:12:37.542 --> 03:12:40.284
3rd-level, I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt her again.

03:12:41.802 --> 03:12:44.232
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

03:12:44.232 --> 03:12:45.272
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:12:45.272 --> 03:12:47.552
MATT: Because you're close, you do not
have disadvantage on the attack.

03:12:47.552 --> 03:12:49.512
ASHLEY: Kill 'er!

03:12:49.512 --> 03:12:50.635
TRAVIS: Whale!

03:12:50.635 --> 03:12:52.243
LAURA: (grumbles)

03:12:52.243 --> 03:12:53.520
(blows raspberry)

03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:54.780
LAURA: Oh!

03:12:54.780 --> 03:12:55.802
28!

03:12:55.802 --> 03:12:56.706
MATT: That definitely hits.

03:12:56.706 --> 03:12:59.023
(cheering)

03:12:59.023 --> 03:13:01.369
That's 6d6, okay.

03:13:01.369 --> 03:13:03.222
MATT: And the next attack against her has advantage.

03:13:03.222 --> 03:13:04.055
LAURA: Yeah!

03:13:04.055 --> 03:13:05.322
MATT: She is a bright, shiny beacon

03:13:05.322 --> 03:13:07.375
to be piñata-ed here beneath the ocean.

03:13:08.805 --> 03:13:10.643
LAURA: (grumbles) Five, six.

03:13:15.835 --> 03:13:18.468
11, 15,

03:13:18.468 --> 03:13:19.626
19 points.

03:13:19.626 --> 03:13:21.185
MATT: 19 points of damage, nice.

03:13:22.222 --> 03:13:24.102
So as you release this blast,

03:13:24.102 --> 03:13:25.702
it shoots through, once again,

03:13:25.702 --> 03:13:27.962
like a divine torpedo blasting her in the side.

03:13:27.962 --> 03:13:30.520
And as it does, you watch as it burns up the side,

03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:32.702
almost ignoring the fact that you're underwater

03:13:32.702 --> 03:13:35.702
for a brief moment and you see flames,

03:13:35.702 --> 03:13:36.972
their own divine nature

03:13:36.972 --> 03:13:40.312
just pushing through the water like it's just air

03:13:40.312 --> 03:13:41.652
and singeing up the side of her body.

03:13:41.652 --> 03:13:44.889
As it burns there, you all have this bright open view

03:13:44.889 --> 03:13:49.272
of Avantika giving off this
radius of bright light around her.

03:13:49.272 --> 03:13:50.812
That finish your turn?

03:13:50.812 --> 03:13:52.782
LAURA: Um, y-y-yes.

03:13:52.782 --> 03:13:54.448
MATT: Okay. Fjord, you're up.

03:13:55.802 --> 03:13:57.142
TRAVIS: I'll take two swings.

03:13:57.142 --> 03:13:58.374
MARISHA: Do it.
MATT: Okay.

03:13:58.374 --> 03:14:00.862
You have to move 30 feet to swim up to her, though.

03:14:00.862 --> 03:14:02.535
TRAVIS: She moved away, right?
MATT: Correct.

03:14:02.535 --> 03:14:04.022
Does your armor allow you to swim?
TRAVIS: Mariner's Breastplate.

03:14:04.022 --> 03:14:06.232
MATT: Yeah, you still have the breastplate,
so yeah, you can catch up to her 30 feet.

03:14:06.232 --> 03:14:08.874
You can totally do that.
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

03:14:08.874 --> 03:14:10.582
Poetry in motion.

03:14:10.582 --> 03:14:12.740
TRAVIS: There's got to be one in the day right?

03:14:16.052 --> 03:14:17.172
That's 29.

03:14:17.172 --> 03:14:19.076
SAM: Yes!
MATT: That definitely hits.

03:14:19.076 --> 03:14:20.109
TRAVIS: 'Kay.

03:14:20.109 --> 03:14:21.167
MARISHA: (quietly) Come on.

03:14:27.012 --> 03:14:28.952
TRAVIS: That's 13 points.

03:14:28.952 --> 03:14:30.532
MATT: 13 points of damage.

03:14:30.532 --> 03:14:31.702
TRAVIS: Second one.

03:14:31.702 --> 03:14:33.017
MATT: Second strike.

03:14:34.872 --> 03:14:37.142
TRAVIS: This is just regular, right?

03:14:37.142 --> 03:14:38.255
LAURA: Yes.

03:14:38.255 --> 03:14:39.615
MATT: Yeah, that is regular strike.

03:14:41.902 --> 03:14:43.049
TRAVIS: It's 28.

03:14:43.049 --> 03:14:44.302
MATT: 28 hits again.

03:14:44.302 --> 03:14:46.272
TRAVIS: I'm going to pump a Divine Smite into this.

03:14:46.272 --> 03:14:47.256
MARISHA: Yes, you will.

03:14:47.256 --> 03:14:49.535
MATT: That's right, because you
still have paladin spell levels.

03:14:50.619 --> 03:14:51.752
MARISHA: Do it.

03:14:51.752 --> 03:14:54.935
TRAVIS: Five, 12,

03:14:54.935 --> 03:14:57.868
14 plus 2d8.

03:14:57.868 --> 03:14:59.682
MATT: 3d8, because she is undead.

03:14:59.682 --> 03:15:01.782
TRAVIS: She <i>is</i> undead.

03:15:01.782 --> 03:15:03.262
Fuck.

03:15:03.262 --> 03:15:04.590
What did I say, 14?

03:15:04.590 --> 03:15:06.116
What was the first one, 14 points?

03:15:06.116 --> 03:15:06.949
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:15:09.964 --> 03:15:10.797
TRAVIS: That's eight,

03:15:11.638 --> 03:15:12.471
16,

03:15:13.921 --> 03:15:15.017
20.

03:15:15.017 --> 03:15:17.342
34 points of damage.

03:15:17.342 --> 03:15:18.845
MATT: 34 points of damage.

03:15:20.975 --> 03:15:22.024
How do you want to do this?

03:15:22.024 --> 03:15:24.533
(cheering)

03:15:25.872 --> 03:15:26.905
TRAVIS: Oh man.

03:15:26.905 --> 03:15:27.738
MARISHA: Yes!

03:15:29.299 --> 03:15:30.132
LAURA: Oh my god!

03:15:30.132 --> 03:15:31.232
TRAVIS: Shit.

03:15:32.382 --> 03:15:36.982
I'll swim up to her, and on the first strike it turns her,

03:15:36.982 --> 03:15:39.782
and on the second one, as I bring the sword back around,

03:15:40.922 --> 03:15:43.232
you see yellow energy shimmer

03:15:43.232 --> 03:15:44.634
from the water around Fjord

03:15:44.634 --> 03:15:46.842
and it collects and runs up through him

03:15:46.842 --> 03:15:49.662
and the runes pulse on the Star Razor.

03:15:49.662 --> 03:15:53.122
MATT: You all watch as the runes pulse upon the Star Razor,

03:15:53.122 --> 03:15:55.282
the blade itself seems to almost extend

03:15:55.282 --> 03:15:57.252
an additional inch and a half.

03:15:57.252 --> 03:15:58.742
You watch as additional runes

03:15:58.742 --> 03:16:00.422
that previously were not visible on the blade

03:16:00.422 --> 03:16:03.610
begin to appear on the outer edge of the base of the blade.

03:16:03.610 --> 03:16:04.669
TRAVIS: What?!

03:16:04.669 --> 03:16:06.774
I was just making that shit up!
MATT: Continue.

03:16:06.774 --> 03:16:10.742
TRAVIS: They pulse. Fjord's yellow eyes flash,

03:16:10.742 --> 03:16:12.585
because fuck Uk'otoa.

03:16:12.585 --> 03:16:13.962
(explosion)

03:16:13.962 --> 03:16:15.152
And just bisect her.

03:16:15.152 --> 03:16:18.152
MATT: As the blade impacts and cuts through the body,

03:16:18.152 --> 03:16:19.442
you just see the swing.

03:16:19.442 --> 03:16:21.722
All the energy streaks through,

03:16:21.722 --> 03:16:23.292
and there's a moment where it's just

03:16:23.292 --> 03:16:25.462
calm and still in the darkness below.

03:16:25.462 --> 03:16:26.852
Avantika doesn't react.

03:16:26.852 --> 03:16:28.655
The blade itself now goes dark.

03:16:30.372 --> 03:16:34.172
And you watch as the center of the chest,

03:16:34.172 --> 03:16:38.152
a thin line of white light appears.

03:16:38.152 --> 03:16:40.185
Her head lolls down towards it.

03:16:41.072 --> 03:16:42.522
And looks back up towards you.

03:16:43.662 --> 03:16:44.922
And as she opens her mouth,

03:16:44.922 --> 03:16:47.722
the inside of her mouth is glowing with that same light.

03:16:49.172 --> 03:16:50.032
(explosion)

03:16:50.032 --> 03:16:52.842
As it bursts, completely sending the upper part

03:16:52.842 --> 03:16:54.472
of her torso and lower half of her body

03:16:54.472 --> 03:16:57.752
scattering from each other as in the middle of this space.

03:16:57.752 --> 03:16:59.696
It's like when you see a depth charge explode.

03:16:59.696 --> 03:17:01.154
There's a-- (explosion) under the water.

03:17:01.154 --> 03:17:02.545
Before it--

03:17:02.545 --> 03:17:03.861
vanishes there.

03:17:03.861 --> 03:17:06.842
Leaving the two parts of her just setting adrift,

03:17:06.842 --> 03:17:09.992
lifeless and un-lifeless, in the dark depths.

03:17:09.992 --> 03:17:12.025
LAURA: Go get the orb, go get the orb.

03:17:12.025 --> 03:17:13.762
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I swim.

03:17:13.762 --> 03:17:15.392
I swim down to her lower half.

03:17:15.392 --> 03:17:17.112
Find whatever knapsack or pocket

03:17:17.112 --> 03:17:20.315
she was putting it in and search for it.

03:17:20.315 --> 03:17:21.952
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

03:17:21.952 --> 03:17:23.862
TRAVIS: Oh god, please have it.

03:17:23.862 --> 03:17:26.272
LAURA: Otherwise we just have to take her whole body.

03:17:26.272 --> 03:17:27.105
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:17:27.105 --> 03:17:30.212
MATT: Her body has taken quite
a beating in the past few rounds.

03:17:30.212 --> 03:17:31.382
TRAVIS: 24.

03:17:31.382 --> 03:17:32.752
MATT: 24.

03:17:32.752 --> 03:17:35.262
As you rush up towards the body,

03:17:35.262 --> 03:17:37.014
you glance over and watch,

03:17:37.014 --> 03:17:40.374
the jostling of the impact has torn free the orb.

03:17:40.374 --> 03:17:41.415
LAURA: (quietly) Oh my god.

03:17:41.415 --> 03:17:44.458
MATT: But as it begins to plummet, you catch it.

03:17:49.082 --> 03:17:51.435
TRAVIS: I just hold it for a second.

03:17:54.112 --> 03:17:56.742
I look over at everyone.

03:17:56.742 --> 03:17:58.934
Including a shitload of whales.

03:17:58.934 --> 03:18:00.852
LIAM: (whale call)

03:18:00.852 --> 03:18:02.892
TRAVIS: I look at Caleb's giant albino

03:18:02.892 --> 03:18:06.525
and cream colored killer whale.

03:18:06.525 --> 03:18:07.890
SAM: Like an Orange Julius.

03:18:07.890 --> 03:18:10.052
TRAVIS: I'm going to hold onto this

03:18:11.202 --> 03:18:13.352
for a little bit, if you don't mind,

03:18:13.352 --> 03:18:15.935
and I will put it in the Bag of Holding.

03:18:19.132 --> 03:18:21.812
Are there any other reinforcements

03:18:21.812 --> 03:18:23.712
of hers that were coming?

03:18:23.712 --> 03:18:24.662
MATT: Perception check.

03:18:26.422 --> 03:18:29.095
TRAVIS: We've been chasing, I'm pretty sure.

03:18:30.282 --> 03:18:31.862
That's a two.

03:18:31.862 --> 03:18:33.770
TALIESIN: We should run.
MATT: You look pretty alone.

03:18:33.770 --> 03:18:37.905
And by the way, Fjord and Nott--
Veth take two points of cold damage.

03:18:39.212 --> 03:18:40.217
MARISHA: Did you mean Beau?

03:18:40.217 --> 03:18:41.737
MATT: Beau, I mean, sorry.

03:18:41.737 --> 03:18:42.872
TRAVIS: And me too, now.

03:18:42.872 --> 03:18:44.392
LAURA: Oh yeah, we should get back.

03:18:44.392 --> 03:18:45.942
MATT: Yeah, and you as well
because you're no longer an orca.

03:18:45.942 --> 03:18:49.167
TALIESIN: Really quick, I'm going to do
a Mass Cure Wounds for everybody.

03:18:50.912 --> 03:18:52.372
Who needs it?

03:18:52.372 --> 03:18:54.252
Not the whales, I suppose--
MARISHA: I'll take it.

03:18:54.252 --> 03:18:57.272
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five.

03:18:57.272 --> 03:18:58.571
Everyone else is fine.

03:18:58.571 --> 03:18:59.605
LIAM: (whale noises)

03:18:59.605 --> 03:19:01.008
TALIESIN: Are any whales hurt?

03:19:01.008 --> 03:19:02.058
LIAM: (whale noises)

03:19:02.058 --> 03:19:03.589
SAM: No whales were hurt in this--

03:19:03.589 --> 03:19:04.693
(laughter)

03:19:04.693 --> 03:19:06.678
ASHLEY: No whales were hurt in this film.
TALIESIN: Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

03:19:06.678 --> 03:19:08.972
10, 11, that sucked sucked, six.

03:19:08.972 --> 03:19:09.805
SAM: What?

03:19:10.742 --> 03:19:13.252
TALIESIN: 16 healing to everyone.

03:19:13.252 --> 03:19:14.085
LAURA: That's great.

03:19:15.018 --> 03:19:16.228
MATT: All right.

03:19:17.662 --> 03:19:19.892
The cold is taking its toll

03:19:19.892 --> 03:19:23.172
on those who are not protected from the elements.

03:19:23.172 --> 03:19:24.782
As you are healed by Caduceus,

03:19:24.782 --> 03:19:27.092
the whales begin to to gather the party

03:19:27.092 --> 03:19:29.172
that needs some assistance to swim.

03:19:29.172 --> 03:19:31.895
And you hear new sounds in the water around you.

03:19:32.974 --> 03:19:35.812
(whale calls)

03:19:35.812 --> 03:19:39.632
Other orcas seem to have called upon

03:19:39.632 --> 03:19:43.742
the sounds you have been making and the call to join.

03:19:43.742 --> 03:19:45.802
And as you begin to make your way up

03:19:45.802 --> 03:19:47.429
back to the surface of the water,

03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:51.875
you watch as they tear into the remains of Avantika.

03:19:53.002 --> 03:19:55.645
A very easy, scavenged meal.

03:19:56.892 --> 03:20:00.612
TRAVIS: And her sword and dagger have fallen right?

03:20:00.612 --> 03:20:01.842
MATT: They have begun to sink,

03:20:01.842 --> 03:20:03.362
unless one of you wants to try and catch them

03:20:03.362 --> 03:20:04.722
before they reach the bottom of the ocean.

03:20:04.722 --> 03:20:05.953
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind trying.

03:20:05.953 --> 03:20:07.119
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

03:20:07.119 --> 03:20:08.461
TRAVIS: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:20:08.461 --> 03:20:09.605
TRAVIS: I'll do a dash.

03:20:09.605 --> 03:20:11.742
So 60 feet or whatever, yeah.

03:20:11.742 --> 03:20:15.792
MATT: I will say, this is going to be a perception check.

03:20:15.792 --> 03:20:17.535
You have darkvision?
TRAVIS: I do.

03:20:17.535 --> 03:20:20.382
MATT: That'll help. So just make a perception check.

03:20:20.382 --> 03:20:22.706
TRAVIS: Okay. That's...

03:20:22.706 --> 03:20:23.847
18.

03:20:23.847 --> 03:20:25.452
MATT: 18, okay.

03:20:25.452 --> 03:20:27.035
You grab the dagger.

03:20:28.692 --> 03:20:30.082
Go ahead and roll for the other weapon.

03:20:30.082 --> 03:20:31.840
TRAVIS: Perception for this?
MATT: Yes.

03:20:31.840 --> 03:20:34.518
LAURA: Can I cast Enhance Abil-- oh, it's touch.

03:20:34.518 --> 03:20:35.668
TRAVIS: 19.

03:20:35.668 --> 03:20:36.501
MATT: 19.

03:20:36.501 --> 03:20:38.652
You also grab the rapier.

03:20:38.652 --> 03:20:40.402
You have them both.

03:20:40.402 --> 03:20:43.072
Yeah, those are really good perception checks.

03:20:43.072 --> 03:20:44.112
So you have both the weapons.

03:20:44.112 --> 03:20:45.322
You can put them in your Bag of Holding

03:20:45.322 --> 03:20:47.602
and begin to catch up with the rest of them.

03:20:47.602 --> 03:20:48.982
MATT: I'll probably take another--

03:20:48.982 --> 03:20:50.740
MATT: Oh, you do. Everyone takes--

03:20:52.691 --> 03:20:55.232
Actually, that was way too many dice,
I don't know why I did that.

03:20:55.232 --> 03:20:57.027
Three points of cold damage

03:20:57.027 --> 03:20:58.679
to the lot of you. But you will--

03:20:59.542 --> 03:21:00.662
If you guys are waiting for Fjord?

03:21:00.662 --> 03:21:01.782
Or are you heading up to the surface?

03:21:01.782 --> 03:21:03.222
LAURA: We'll wait for Fjord.

03:21:03.222 --> 03:21:05.545
MARISHA: I grab-- I'm going to go up.

03:21:06.752 --> 03:21:08.452
ASHLEY: I'm going to wait for Fjord.
TALIESIN: I'll wait.

03:21:08.452 --> 03:21:10.992
MARISHA: I'll grab Veth and we like,

03:21:10.992 --> 03:21:13.655
go for the water walking buoyancy, try and get up.

03:21:13.655 --> 03:21:15.330
MATT: You both take three more points of cold damage

03:21:15.330 --> 03:21:17.692
before you reach the surface.

03:21:17.692 --> 03:21:20.125
Fjord returns with the weapons and takes another five.

03:21:21.722 --> 03:21:24.322
And the rest of you begin to make your way

03:21:24.322 --> 03:21:27.225
to the icy crest of the ocean.

03:21:29.192 --> 03:21:30.942
A little ways away from the ship,

03:21:30.942 --> 03:21:32.702
but you still have two orcas

03:21:32.702 --> 03:21:34.022
that can pull the rest of the crew.

03:21:34.022 --> 03:21:36.112
And you're only a little over a thousand feet

03:21:36.112 --> 03:21:39.032
away from the Midnight Hammer.

03:21:39.032 --> 03:21:42.956
So you manage to drag the rest of the party

03:21:42.956 --> 03:21:44.292
to the outskirts of the boat

03:21:44.292 --> 03:21:46.932
to where you see the crew remaining,

03:21:46.932 --> 03:21:49.952
including Captain Kem,

03:21:49.952 --> 03:21:53.102
whose ears are dripping a little bit
of blood from the scream earlier,

03:21:53.102 --> 03:21:54.915
glances over the side and goes,

03:21:55.979 --> 03:21:57.852
"All right, so you made some friends,

03:21:57.852 --> 03:21:59.376
"where's the rest of you?"

03:21:59.376 --> 03:22:00.625
MARISHA: They're coming.

03:22:00.625 --> 03:22:03.362
SAM: This <i>is</i> the rest of-- I mean, yeah.

03:22:03.362 --> 03:22:06.295
MARISHA: They're whales.
MATT: "Throw the ladder over."

03:22:06.295 --> 03:22:08.432
And they throw two of the metallic chain ladders

03:22:08.432 --> 03:22:09.922
over the side that clink down

03:22:09.922 --> 03:22:11.772
and then splash into the water below.

03:22:13.042 --> 03:22:15.132
Those who wish to could drop their orca form,

03:22:15.132 --> 03:22:16.552
but eventually you all climb your way

03:22:16.552 --> 03:22:18.232
back onto the deck of the ship.

03:22:18.232 --> 03:22:21.612
LIAM: Not net yet, first killer whale

03:22:21.612 --> 03:22:24.501
bumps Jester a little too hard.

03:22:24.501 --> 03:22:25.417
(whale call)

03:22:25.417 --> 03:22:29.512
And if you've ever seen a killer whale,
like a giant aquatic creature,

03:22:29.512 --> 03:22:31.678
like, do a big toothy smile?

03:22:31.678 --> 03:22:34.099
(whale call)

03:22:34.099 --> 03:22:37.032
LAURA: Oh, I do that thing where
they reach in and they pet the tongue.

03:22:37.032 --> 03:22:38.873
(laughter)

03:22:38.873 --> 03:22:39.854
SAM: You gotta do a--

03:22:39.854 --> 03:22:41.010
LIAM: (blowing forcefully)

03:22:41.010 --> 03:22:43.932
MATT: There it is.
ASHLEY: There you go.

03:22:43.932 --> 03:22:45.077
Big boy.

03:22:45.077 --> 03:22:46.968
LIAM: (whoosh) Oh.
LAURA: Okay, okay.

03:22:46.968 --> 03:22:49.826
LIAM: <i>Scheiße</i>, the water is cold.
TRAVIS: Y'all are special.

03:22:49.826 --> 03:22:52.940
MARISHA: Caduceus, can you start boiling some water for tea?

03:22:52.940 --> 03:22:53.912
Like, right now?

03:22:53.912 --> 03:22:56.932
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm going to take this stuff off,

03:22:56.932 --> 03:22:59.892
and put on something dry and then start the kettle.

03:22:59.892 --> 03:23:01.857
LAURA: Take the rod of hand-warming.

03:23:01.857 --> 03:23:03.472
MARISHA: Oh yes, thank you!

03:23:03.472 --> 03:23:06.182
LAURA: Everybody huddle around the rod of hand-warming.

03:23:07.262 --> 03:23:10.842
TRAVIS: That mage was swallowed, right?

03:23:10.842 --> 03:23:12.102
Eaten whole?

03:23:12.102 --> 03:23:13.442
LAURA: Yeah, Caleb ate him.

03:23:13.442 --> 03:23:15.537
LIAM: I ate him, he'll come out later.

03:23:15.537 --> 03:23:17.012
SAM: Oh god.
LIAM: I think.

03:23:17.012 --> 03:23:18.037
SAM: How does that work?

03:23:18.037 --> 03:23:19.358
LIAM: I'm not entirely sure.

03:23:19.358 --> 03:23:21.294
(laughter)

03:23:21.294 --> 03:23:24.811
TRAVIS: If the crystal that he had happens to
make its way out that would be useful.

03:23:24.811 --> 03:23:29.292
MATT: So if we are going specifically into the details

03:23:29.292 --> 03:23:31.217
of what happens when somebody
eats something and then polymorphs back.

03:23:31.217 --> 03:23:32.590
LIAM: Yes, yes we are Matt.

03:23:32.590 --> 03:23:34.413
MATT: I didn't detail at the time

03:23:34.413 --> 03:23:36.304
because we were in the middle of the rush for the narrative,

03:23:36.304 --> 03:23:39.095
but when you transformed, in
the process of transforming back,

03:23:39.095 --> 03:23:40.996
you regurgitate the remains of what you had devoured.

03:23:40.996 --> 03:23:41.882
LAURA: Ew!

03:23:41.882 --> 03:23:43.672
LIAM: (retches)

03:23:43.672 --> 03:23:47.582
MATT: So there is a pulverized corpse

03:23:47.582 --> 03:23:51.582
of whatever that strange fish humanoid creature was

03:23:51.582 --> 03:23:54.703
sitting frozen on the upper deck of the ship.

03:23:54.703 --> 03:23:57.422
LAURA: Oh good.
TALIESIN: Do we want to interrogate it later or no?

03:23:57.422 --> 03:23:59.814
TRAVIS: I'm going to go look for the, um--

03:23:59.814 --> 03:24:01.372
try and investigate and find that crystal

03:24:01.372 --> 03:24:05.372
that he used to search for the Cloven Crystal.

03:24:05.372 --> 03:24:07.142
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

03:24:07.142 --> 03:24:08.402
LAURA: I'm going to run up to Fjord

03:24:08.402 --> 03:24:10.352
and enhance his abilities to do so.

03:24:10.352 --> 03:24:13.365
MATT: Okay, so advantage on your investigation check.

03:24:15.081 --> 03:24:17.630
TRAVIS: 21.

03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:18.463
MATT: 21.

03:24:18.463 --> 03:24:21.822
Sifting through the thoroughly trashed

03:24:21.822 --> 03:24:23.062
remains of this creature.

03:24:23.062 --> 03:24:26.215
It is just a pile of chum.

03:24:27.852 --> 03:24:31.192
But you find within one of its torn satchels

03:24:33.362 --> 03:24:36.145
a small orange-ish crystal.

03:24:37.122 --> 03:24:38.592
It looks cloudy towards the base

03:24:38.592 --> 03:24:40.392
and then comes to more of a glassy finish

03:24:40.392 --> 03:24:43.072
at one of its a jagged natural points.

03:24:43.072 --> 03:24:45.762
But that is what you recall

03:24:45.762 --> 03:24:47.292
him pulling out when he arrived.

03:24:47.292 --> 03:24:49.882
TRAVIS: I'll scoop some like, sleety snow

03:24:49.882 --> 03:24:51.182
off of the railing of the ship.

03:24:51.182 --> 03:24:56.182
Kind of wash it off and hold it up and show Caleb.

03:24:56.352 --> 03:24:58.872
This is what they used.

03:24:58.872 --> 03:25:00.702
I don't know if you can divine anything

03:25:00.702 --> 03:25:03.019
from it to use it, but.
LIAM: Probably so, yeah.

03:25:04.369 --> 03:25:06.752
TALIESIN: Got a lot of things for you to look at.

03:25:06.752 --> 03:25:08.882
LIAM: You picked up some toys down below as well?

03:25:08.882 --> 03:25:10.275
Can I take a look at those?

03:25:10.275 --> 03:25:12.102
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take out the rapier and the dagger

03:25:12.102 --> 03:25:14.185
and lay them on the deck.

03:25:15.382 --> 03:25:16.442
MATT: Interesting point.

03:25:16.442 --> 03:25:18.492
When you pulled the rapier forth,

03:25:18.492 --> 03:25:21.402
you recall when Avantika was wielding it and striking you

03:25:21.402 --> 03:25:23.352
it had that twisted,

03:25:23.352 --> 03:25:25.932
tentacle-like design along the central blade,

03:25:25.932 --> 03:25:28.932
and there was a really intricate,
barnacle-encrusted handle to it.

03:25:28.932 --> 03:25:32.392
When you pull it from the the bag,

03:25:32.392 --> 03:25:34.072
it's just a plain rapier.

03:25:36.162 --> 03:25:38.600
TRAVIS: This looks different than it did before.

03:25:38.600 --> 03:25:40.042
LIAM: King's blessing.

03:25:41.062 --> 03:25:43.352
TRAVIS: Maybe there's a way to activate it or unlock it,

03:25:43.352 --> 03:25:47.042
or maybe it's bereft of all the power.

03:25:47.042 --> 03:25:49.345
TRAVIS: I think the power was inside her all along.

03:25:49.345 --> 03:25:52.252
(laughter)

03:25:52.252 --> 03:25:54.622
TRAVIS: That's very positive of you, Caduceus.

03:25:54.622 --> 03:25:56.972
LIAM: Probably the blessing of your former master.

03:25:56.972 --> 03:25:57.979
TALIESIN: Mm.

03:25:57.979 --> 03:25:59.145
LIAM: Rotten down into it.

03:26:00.742 --> 03:26:04.932
TRAVIS: I'm assuming that because,

03:26:04.932 --> 03:26:06.472
while it was hidden in your necklace,

03:26:06.472 --> 03:26:11.002
it wasn't necessarily off or out of this plane,

03:26:11.002 --> 03:26:12.402
they were able to locate it.

03:26:12.402 --> 03:26:14.892
The Bag of Holding is another plane,

03:26:14.892 --> 03:26:16.152
a pocket dimension, right?

03:26:16.152 --> 03:26:18.642
LIAM: Yeah, we should probably think of a more--

03:26:19.542 --> 03:26:21.772
that's the short term solution, yeah?

03:26:21.772 --> 03:26:23.302
But we should think of a long-term,

03:26:23.302 --> 03:26:26.492
like perhaps visiting Yussa when we have free time.

03:26:26.492 --> 03:26:27.982
When do we have free time?

03:26:27.982 --> 03:26:32.982
And perhaps deposit within the Heirloom Sphere.

03:26:33.182 --> 03:26:34.765
TRAVIS: There's another idea.

03:26:38.223 --> 03:26:39.301
Yasha?

03:26:39.301 --> 03:26:40.376
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:26:41.594 --> 03:26:44.012
TRAVIS: Would you take a swing at this

03:26:44.012 --> 03:26:47.502
fucking orb and see what happens?

03:26:47.502 --> 03:26:49.012
ASHLEY: It would be my pleasure.

03:26:49.012 --> 03:26:52.502
TALIESIN: Do you have the power to do that right now?

03:26:52.502 --> 03:26:56.261
MARISHA: She was able to smash that bowl back in the day.

03:26:56.261 --> 03:26:59.012
LIAM: Everybody back up a few steps.
SAM: Magician's Judge.

03:26:59.012 --> 03:27:00.282
TRAVIS: I had wanted to hold onto this

03:27:00.282 --> 03:27:02.812
because it's always better to hold the last key

03:27:02.812 --> 03:27:06.692
than to open up the possibilities of it being

03:27:06.692 --> 03:27:10.062
reformed or remade and then out of our control.

03:27:10.062 --> 03:27:13.054
But this is the second time that

03:27:13.054 --> 03:27:15.479
you all have been put in danger

03:27:16.852 --> 03:27:18.302
and we don't seem to be on a--

03:27:20.482 --> 03:27:22.073
I don't know, it just seems like a

03:27:22.073 --> 03:27:23.929
better equation if it's out of it.

03:27:26.162 --> 03:27:27.979
SAM: Sure.

03:27:27.979 --> 03:27:30.854
TALIESIN: I'm going to Bless you before you do this.
LIAM: See what happens, if it's possible.

03:27:30.854 --> 03:27:31.837
What it means.

03:27:31.837 --> 03:27:33.962
ASHLEY: Okay, that's an extra d4.

03:27:33.962 --> 03:27:35.392
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:27:35.392 --> 03:27:36.583
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:27:37.684 --> 03:27:39.317
Which one do I do?

03:27:40.352 --> 03:27:44.712
MATT: So are you striking the Cloven Crystal?

03:27:44.712 --> 03:27:45.795
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: With...?

03:27:47.992 --> 03:27:49.872
ASHLEY: With Magician's Judge.

03:27:49.872 --> 03:27:51.692
MATT: All right, do you set it in the center of the deck

03:27:51.692 --> 03:27:53.932
here on the top of the ship or you could do it below decks?

03:27:53.932 --> 03:27:54.765
What do you do?

03:27:54.765 --> 03:27:56.732
LAURA: We should do it below deck, probably.

03:27:56.732 --> 03:27:59.782
So it doesn't bounce away and fall into the water.

03:27:59.782 --> 03:28:02.202
TRAVIS: Actually, are there any of those

03:28:02.202 --> 03:28:04.215
floating glaciers outside of the ship?

03:28:05.582 --> 03:28:06.902
MATT: The ship has been slowly moving.

03:28:06.902 --> 03:28:09.292
You glance over, it's a little sporadic

03:28:09.292 --> 03:28:11.440
but there are a handful of floating ice sheets.

03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:13.418
TALIESIN: It may get away if it's on the ocean.

03:28:15.192 --> 03:28:19.362
TRAVIS: I just don't want it to explode and ruin the ship.

03:28:19.362 --> 03:28:20.362
TALIESIN: I think maybe we wait.

03:28:20.362 --> 03:28:22.882
LIAM: I have to remind us of one very important detail, too.

03:28:22.882 --> 03:28:25.782
MARISHA: I walk around and I start
picking up all the fireworks.

03:28:25.782 --> 03:28:27.690
LIAM: That's it, the deck is covered in--

03:28:27.690 --> 03:28:28.940
(laughter)

03:28:28.940 --> 03:28:32.748
two shopping carts worth of fireworks.

03:28:32.748 --> 03:28:34.922
MATT: I was waiting for one errant Fireball.

03:28:34.922 --> 03:28:37.750
LIAM: Oh, I was aware the whole time.

03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:38.700
Well aware the entire time.

03:28:38.700 --> 03:28:40.257
TRAVIS: All I could think of were horcruxes

03:28:40.257 --> 03:28:42.345
and those things never go quietly.

03:28:42.345 --> 03:28:44.569
MARISHA: You just see Beau passing in the background

03:28:44.569 --> 03:28:48.462
just with a tender's amount of--

03:28:48.462 --> 03:28:50.382
LIAM: If things had really gone south

03:28:50.382 --> 03:28:52.442
I was just going to use a fire cantrip

03:28:52.442 --> 03:28:54.209
and be like-- (whooshes)

03:28:55.111 --> 03:28:57.634
(fireworks noises)

03:28:57.634 --> 03:28:59.522
ASHLEY: You know, I've remembered why.

03:28:59.522 --> 03:29:01.212
I think we used Dispel Magic

03:29:01.212 --> 03:29:03.615
with Magician's Judge with that bowl.

03:29:04.492 --> 03:29:05.802
LAURA: You did.

03:29:05.802 --> 03:29:07.159
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:29:07.159 --> 03:29:09.242
LAURA: Let's try it again.

03:29:09.242 --> 03:29:11.502
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's try it again.

03:29:11.502 --> 03:29:12.985
LIAM: Wait, hold on one moment.

03:29:12.985 --> 03:29:14.742
MATT: Yeah?

03:29:14.742 --> 03:29:17.122
LIAM: Everybody except for Yasha gather around me.

03:29:17.122 --> 03:29:21.052
And I'm going to pull out a small glass bead

03:29:21.052 --> 03:29:24.812
and roll it in my hand three or four, five times,

03:29:24.812 --> 03:29:25.882
and then pull my hands apart

03:29:25.882 --> 03:29:29.502
and the bead floats between my hands and then shatters

03:29:29.502 --> 03:29:33.672
and a seemingly glass shimmering sphere forms

03:29:33.672 --> 03:29:36.762
that goes in 10 feet in every direction around me.

03:29:36.762 --> 03:29:37.612
MATT: And this is...?

03:29:37.612 --> 03:29:40.202
LIAM: This is Globe of Invulnerability.

03:29:40.202 --> 03:29:42.315
MATT: Globe of Invulnerability?
LIAM: Yeah.

03:29:42.315 --> 03:29:44.192
So just, I don't know if this is anything,

03:29:44.192 --> 03:29:47.302
but come closer, please. As you were, Yasha.

03:29:47.302 --> 03:29:50.702
MARISHA: Stick my foot out and
scoop another firework into it.

03:29:52.060 --> 03:29:53.885
There we go, we're good.

03:29:54.982 --> 03:29:55.815
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:29:55.815 --> 03:29:56.648
LIAM: Explorers.

03:29:56.648 --> 03:29:58.407
ASHLEY: Here we go, big money.

03:30:01.282 --> 03:30:02.740
TALIESIN: Plus the d4.

03:30:05.023 --> 03:30:06.498
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

03:30:07.602 --> 03:30:11.002
ASHLEY: That would be 23.

03:30:11.002 --> 03:30:12.772
MATT: 23, okay.

03:30:12.772 --> 03:30:16.742
As you all watch, Yasha takes a breath,

03:30:16.742 --> 03:30:18.342
holds the blade in front of her,

03:30:22.412 --> 03:30:26.454
and with expected, but still

03:30:26.454 --> 03:30:28.779
incredible speed and might

03:30:28.779 --> 03:30:32.762
she arcs down with a giant scream and as it hits,

03:30:32.762 --> 03:30:34.822
there is a flash and spark.

03:30:37.082 --> 03:30:41.752
And there the blade sits atop an untouched orb

03:30:41.752 --> 03:30:45.492
that has been pushed about a half an inch into the wood.

03:30:45.492 --> 03:30:46.459
LAURA: Wow.

03:30:46.459 --> 03:30:49.582
MATT: And as she pulls the blade back,
it appears to be unscathed.

03:30:49.582 --> 03:30:50.415
TRAVIS: Whoa.

03:30:51.672 --> 03:30:53.772
TALIESIN: Some things just can't be undone.

03:30:53.772 --> 03:30:54.605
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:30:54.605 --> 03:30:56.962
LAURA: We have to find a way to destroy it though.

03:30:56.962 --> 03:30:58.212
There's got to be a way.

03:30:58.212 --> 03:31:00.372
TRAVIS: Or lock it away as Caleb suggested.

03:31:00.372 --> 03:31:01.862
I mean, we can always try and hit it harder,

03:31:01.862 --> 03:31:04.542
but you hit it pretty fucking hard.

03:31:04.542 --> 03:31:09.372
TALIESIN: I think the ball is the-- it's the right plan.

03:31:09.372 --> 03:31:13.052
SAM: We also have Vess DeRogna to seal it away

03:31:13.052 --> 03:31:14.779
or hide it or something.

03:31:14.779 --> 03:31:16.804
TRAVIS: I don't really trust her with something this--

03:31:16.804 --> 03:31:19.062
LIAM: No.
SAM: All right, all right.

03:31:19.062 --> 03:31:20.670
TALIESIN: Keep it in the bag for now.

03:31:20.670 --> 03:31:24.275
TRAVIS: I'll put it back in the
Bag of Holding. Thank you, Yasha.

03:31:24.275 --> 03:31:25.675
ASHLEY: I gave it a good try.

03:31:28.302 --> 03:31:30.832
TALIESIN: Put it in the ball when it's time,

03:31:30.832 --> 03:31:32.372
throw it into the Astral Sea.

03:31:32.372 --> 03:31:35.264
TRAVIS: I'm sorry this is the second time this has happened.

03:31:38.362 --> 03:31:41.634
I need to close the chapter on a few things

03:31:41.634 --> 03:31:43.475
before it endangers us a third time.

03:31:45.252 --> 03:31:47.775
Not sure how or when, but I'll try.

03:31:49.997 --> 03:31:52.697
MARISHA: I have a feeling an
opportunity will present itself.

03:31:54.942 --> 03:31:55.775
LIAM: Yeah, now we know.

03:31:55.775 --> 03:31:58.015
For now, put it in that bag.

03:31:59.032 --> 03:32:00.365
That should do for now.

03:32:02.642 --> 03:32:03.892
Short term, short term.

03:32:03.892 --> 03:32:06.602
TRAVIS: In the beginning, when she came over the deck

03:32:08.362 --> 03:32:11.882
she wasn't even focused on the Cloven Crystal.

03:32:11.882 --> 03:32:13.499
She was trying to pull <i>me</i>.

03:32:14.382 --> 03:32:16.802
I would love to think that was
just the personal side of her

03:32:16.802 --> 03:32:19.720
trying to get vengeance or payback.

03:32:21.772 --> 03:32:23.972
I just can't put <i>myself</i> in a Bag of Holding.

03:32:27.112 --> 03:32:29.995
LAURA: Do you think Uk'otoa will come after <i>you</i>?

03:32:34.053 --> 03:32:35.705
TRAVIS: It certainly feels that way.

03:32:40.372 --> 03:32:42.592
We'll think about it another time.

03:32:42.592 --> 03:32:43.702
We have things we need to do.

03:32:43.702 --> 03:32:46.852
And perhaps <i>that</i> we can
make Vess DeRogna aware of,

03:32:46.852 --> 03:32:48.682
just that there are outside parties looking

03:32:48.682 --> 03:32:51.952
and we'll try to be more careful.

03:32:57.412 --> 03:32:59.962
SAM: Odds are good that Uk'otoa

03:32:59.962 --> 03:33:02.855
won't come, like, today, probably.

03:33:05.063 --> 03:33:07.281
LAURA: He's still sealed away.

03:33:07.281 --> 03:33:09.282
He has to have people doing things for him

03:33:09.282 --> 03:33:11.965
and you killed his, like, top henchman.

03:33:13.002 --> 03:33:14.692
TRAVIS: We've done it once before.

03:33:14.692 --> 03:33:17.272
There was not a second attempt the first time.

03:33:17.272 --> 03:33:20.225
So I would assume we have some time.

03:33:22.032 --> 03:33:26.135
LIAM: In the meantime, if you want, you can have this.

03:33:28.062 --> 03:33:31.442
Caleb holds up the medallion that he wore for so long.

03:33:31.442 --> 03:33:32.641
LAURA: Oh!

03:33:32.641 --> 03:33:34.852
TRAVIS: Oh, is that the no-scrying--?

03:33:34.852 --> 03:33:36.535
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Correct.

03:33:38.282 --> 03:33:40.212
TRAVIS: N-- no. You--

03:33:40.212 --> 03:33:42.112
LIAM: I haven't been wearing it for weeks.

03:33:44.462 --> 03:33:45.295
TRAVIS: Why?

03:33:47.252 --> 03:33:49.052
MARISHA: We're traveling with Vess DeRogna.

03:33:49.052 --> 03:33:51.139
LAURA: The Assembly knows where he is.
LIAM: It's time to put it away.

03:33:51.139 --> 03:33:55.432
It's been extraneous for a very long time.

03:33:55.432 --> 03:33:58.307
If they wanted to kill me, they
could have looked for one of you.

03:34:00.622 --> 03:34:04.182
The moment that I decided to hitch my wagon

03:34:04.182 --> 03:34:06.952
to the Mighty Nein, this became obsolete.

03:34:08.602 --> 03:34:10.927
But, not so for

03:34:12.285 --> 03:34:16.168
your scaly friend, perhaps.

03:34:17.522 --> 03:34:18.538
MARISHA: He's right.

03:34:19.539 --> 03:34:20.789
TALIESIN: It's a good idea.

03:34:23.012 --> 03:34:24.762
LIAM: Think about it.
And I throw it.

03:34:25.882 --> 03:34:27.632
TRAVIS: I catch it.

03:34:27.632 --> 03:34:28.465
I'll take it.

03:34:29.572 --> 03:34:31.302
SAM: He misses, it falls over the deck.

03:34:31.302 --> 03:34:32.518
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

03:34:33.682 --> 03:34:35.199
LIAM: I turn into a squid.

03:34:37.612 --> 03:34:39.412
TRAVIS: I know how much this meant to you.

03:34:40.902 --> 03:34:42.744
It was basically a part of you.

03:34:44.342 --> 03:34:48.723
Feels strange to have changed places with you

03:34:48.723 --> 03:34:50.882
in some small way.

03:34:50.882 --> 03:34:52.913
LIAM: I resented it as well.

03:34:54.172 --> 03:34:56.232
So be careful.

03:34:57.422 --> 03:34:58.552
TRAVIS: I'll put it on.

03:34:58.552 --> 03:35:00.361
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Do I need to attune to it?

03:35:00.361 --> 03:35:01.391
LIAM: Yeah.

03:35:01.391 --> 03:35:03.732
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

03:35:03.732 --> 03:35:05.270
LIAM: That's the thing.

03:35:06.452 --> 03:35:10.303
TALIESIN: Oh that, oh yep, water on, hold on.

03:35:10.303 --> 03:35:11.649
I'm going to run and go get the kettle.
SAM: Oh, the tea.

03:35:11.649 --> 03:35:12.857
LAURA: The tea.

03:35:12.857 --> 03:35:15.092
MATT: Okay, as you head down to bring in to prepare tea

03:35:15.092 --> 03:35:18.105
you can see us sitting at a table beneath the decks,

03:35:19.042 --> 03:35:20.832
currently enjoying a cup of tea

03:35:20.832 --> 03:35:24.742
already prepared for herself is Lady Vess DeRogna.

03:35:24.742 --> 03:35:25.682
TALIESIN: I had special stuff,

03:35:25.682 --> 03:35:28.692
but I'm glad you got into that already.

03:35:28.692 --> 03:35:30.242
MATT: "Oh, my apologies.

03:35:31.292 --> 03:35:34.632
"Am I to hear that you've already had quite an adventure?"

03:35:34.632 --> 03:35:37.502
TALIESIN: That is a long conversation, but yeah.

03:35:37.502 --> 03:35:39.402
It seems to have turned out all right.

03:35:40.287 --> 03:35:42.229
MATT: "That is why I hired you."

03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:44.202
TALIESIN: We come with some baggage on occasion.

03:35:44.202 --> 03:35:45.518
MATT: "Don't we all?"

03:35:45.518 --> 03:35:46.561
TALIESIN: We handled it.

03:35:46.561 --> 03:35:48.222
MATT: "Don't we all?"

03:35:48.222 --> 03:35:50.752
And she gets up and takes the tea cup for herself

03:35:50.752 --> 03:35:53.162
and gives a nod and walks back to her chambers.

03:35:53.162 --> 03:35:54.932
TALIESIN: You see what we're drinking
later and you want some,

03:35:54.932 --> 03:35:57.902
just let-- oh, you're fine, okay.

03:35:57.902 --> 03:36:00.402
I'm going to run up and give everyone hot water cups.

03:36:01.372 --> 03:36:02.662
I was going to save this for later,

03:36:02.662 --> 03:36:06.502
I have more, but I figured we're celebrating.

03:36:06.502 --> 03:36:09.582
This was a good day, technically.

03:36:09.582 --> 03:36:14.582
I pull out these little dark brown,

03:36:14.582 --> 03:36:19.245
muddied-looking stones that are speckled with color.

03:36:20.372 --> 03:36:25.372
And I pop one in everybody's hot water cup

03:36:25.732 --> 03:36:27.792
and they begin to dissolve

03:36:27.792 --> 03:36:29.432
and tiny little marshmallows pop out.

03:36:29.432 --> 03:36:30.265
(gasping)

03:36:30.265 --> 03:36:31.098
It's hot chocolate.

03:36:31.098 --> 03:36:32.042
When we went to get some,

03:36:32.042 --> 03:36:33.652
I just had to buy it.

03:36:33.652 --> 03:36:34.794
TRAVIS: Hot chocolate bombs?

03:36:34.794 --> 03:36:35.871
TALIESIN: I've got a bunch of them.

03:36:35.871 --> 03:36:38.092
I spent a gold on this stuff.

03:36:38.092 --> 03:36:39.566
I got some tea, too, but I was like.

03:36:39.566 --> 03:36:41.362
LAURA: Caduceus, this is the most

03:36:41.362 --> 03:36:42.902
amazing thing you've ever done.

03:36:42.902 --> 03:36:45.419
TALIESIN: Only when we do really good stuff, okay?

03:36:46.887 --> 03:36:48.552
ASHLEY: It changes, it keeps going

03:36:48.552 --> 03:36:50.372
and then all the marshmallows came.

03:36:50.372 --> 03:36:52.152
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a bunch of different flavors.

03:36:52.152 --> 03:36:55.158
I got a variety pack.

03:36:55.158 --> 03:36:57.108
ASHLEY: It's delicious!
LAURA: Let's fight Avantika every day!

03:36:57.108 --> 03:36:59.082
(laughter)

03:36:59.082 --> 03:37:00.585
TALIESIN: Oh, let's not, but yeah.

03:37:01.552 --> 03:37:04.052
MARISHA: Because I have too many incenses,

03:37:04.052 --> 03:37:05.942
it's a celebration.

03:37:05.942 --> 03:37:09.069
I go to the bow of the ship and pop up a few.

03:37:09.069 --> 03:37:11.986
(laughter)

03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:15.076
MATT: (small explosions)

03:37:15.076 --> 03:37:16.612
MARISHA: And I light them.

03:37:16.612 --> 03:37:19.332
Just have a little cruise ship and hot chocolate.

03:37:19.332 --> 03:37:20.582
MATT: As you guys look over--

03:37:20.582 --> 03:37:25.582
and because while the storm itself has somewhat lessened,

03:37:25.752 --> 03:37:27.482
it's less majestic fireworks,

03:37:27.482 --> 03:37:30.582
more like muffled bursts and flashes of color

03:37:30.582 --> 03:37:32.782
in the above clouds and fog.

03:37:32.782 --> 03:37:34.815
But it is still very beautiful.

03:37:34.815 --> 03:37:37.181
LAURA: I just focus steam up.

03:37:37.181 --> 03:37:39.302
LIAM: While you're shooting them off, too,

03:37:39.302 --> 03:37:41.902
Caleb's got his hot chocolate just on one finger.

03:37:41.902 --> 03:37:44.552
And he's just reliving his C-Rex moment going like--

03:37:45.819 --> 03:37:48.819
(laughter)

03:37:51.882 --> 03:37:53.112
MATT: Enjoying your day of celebration.

03:37:53.112 --> 03:37:57.020
You continue for the rest of the day's travel without issue.

03:37:57.020 --> 03:37:59.892
Let's see how we can do for the rest of this journey.

03:37:59.892 --> 03:38:01.289
Are you still rolling a d10?

03:38:01.289 --> 03:38:03.022
TRAVIS: I'm not rolling those anymore.

03:38:03.022 --> 03:38:03.929
LIAM: Come on, Cap'n.

03:38:05.202 --> 03:38:07.692
Yeah, you are, we're on the open sea.

03:38:07.692 --> 03:38:10.090
TRAVIS: Can't roll a one again, right?

03:38:10.090 --> 03:38:12.072
LAURA: If you roll a one again, does that mean

03:38:12.072 --> 03:38:12.905
we have to fight Avantika again?

03:38:12.905 --> 03:38:14.192
MATT: You'll find out what happens

03:38:14.192 --> 03:38:15.517
if you roll the same number.

03:38:15.517 --> 03:38:17.235
LIAM: Now one is Dashilla.

03:38:19.365 --> 03:38:20.198
TRAVIS: (laughing) Dashilla.

03:38:20.198 --> 03:38:23.562
MATT: It's just the ocean rogues gallery, just coming back.

03:38:26.942 --> 03:38:28.992
TRAVIS: Listen, motherfucker.

03:38:31.072 --> 03:38:36.050
If you want to be the only d10 in this tray, don't fuck me.

03:38:37.982 --> 03:38:38.815
Seven.

03:38:39.865 --> 03:38:41.352
LIAM: Lucky seven.

03:38:41.352 --> 03:38:43.022
MATT: The next day is a fair day's travel.

03:38:43.022 --> 03:38:47.772
Without issue, you progress onward un-attacked

03:38:47.772 --> 03:38:51.689
by terrifying entities from beneath the waves.

03:38:53.857 --> 03:38:55.592
With only five days left of your journey,

03:38:55.592 --> 03:38:56.919
go ahead and roll for the next day.

03:38:56.919 --> 03:38:58.640
MARISHA: Five days left.

03:39:01.512 --> 03:39:03.155
TRAVIS: Three.

03:39:03.155 --> 03:39:04.740
LIAM: A three hour tour.

03:39:04.740 --> 03:39:06.392
MATT: Three, clear weather and exuberant crew

03:39:06.392 --> 03:39:09.262
make for rapid time minus one day to your journey.

03:39:09.262 --> 03:39:11.380
So you actually make two days of travel on that journey.

03:39:11.380 --> 03:39:12.895
MARISHA: Make up some time.

03:39:12.895 --> 03:39:13.728
MATT: Make up a little bit of time.

03:39:13.728 --> 03:39:15.128
TRAVIS: Nice.
LAURA: Great.

03:39:15.128 --> 03:39:15.961
MATT: Okay.

03:39:15.961 --> 03:39:17.831
TRAVIS: I'll attune to the amulet

03:39:17.831 --> 03:39:20.289
and I'll take off the...

03:39:22.772 --> 03:39:23.997
ring of fire resistance.

03:39:23.997 --> 03:39:27.203
LIAM: Oh!
SAM: That you just bought?

03:39:28.342 --> 03:39:29.660
TRAVIS: Yeah, priorities.
TALIESIN: I'm proud of you.

03:39:29.660 --> 03:39:32.822
SAM: Well, we'll switch them up when we get to land.

03:39:32.822 --> 03:39:35.532
MATT: Does your Mariner's armor require attunement?

03:39:35.532 --> 03:39:36.365
TRAVIS: It does not.

03:39:36.365 --> 03:39:37.662
I have a cloak of protection,

03:39:37.662 --> 03:39:39.255
the ring of fire resistance,

03:39:39.255 --> 03:39:40.088
and the Star Razor.

03:39:40.088 --> 03:39:42.012
MATT: Fair enough. Yeah, that does it.

03:39:42.012 --> 03:39:43.902
So three more days of travel.

03:39:43.902 --> 03:39:45.962
If anyone else wants to accomplish anything before--

03:39:45.962 --> 03:39:47.122
SAM: I'm going to try to sweet talk some

03:39:47.122 --> 03:39:48.442
of the crew into giving me--

03:39:48.442 --> 03:39:49.912
are there cannons on the ship

03:39:49.912 --> 03:39:51.303
or is it just the ballista?
MATT: It's just the ballista.

03:39:51.303 --> 03:39:53.053
There are no cannons.
SAM: Damn. Forget it.

03:39:54.262 --> 03:39:55.095
MATT: Fair enough.

03:39:55.095 --> 03:39:58.615
LAURA: I'm going to spend one of
those days scrying on Molly again.

03:39:59.522 --> 03:40:00.355
MATT: Okay.

03:40:01.202 --> 03:40:03.612
LIAM: Oh, I'm finishing out any--

03:40:03.612 --> 03:40:04.902
I can't remember if I did or not--

03:40:04.902 --> 03:40:07.742
all my spell scroll homework.

03:40:07.742 --> 03:40:10.904
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: So absorbed two spells in this.

03:40:10.904 --> 03:40:13.203
MATT: You have enough time to do that without issue, yeah.

03:40:13.203 --> 03:40:15.194
LAURA: (laughs) Oh my god.

03:40:16.552 --> 03:40:18.110
MATT: As you attempt--
LAURA: I just remembered

03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:20.510
Sprinkle was in my hood the whole time.

03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:24.453
(laughter)

03:40:26.192 --> 03:40:29.298
TALIESIN: I feel like Sprinkle was
back in the boat the whole time.

03:40:29.298 --> 03:40:31.952
LAURA: Can we say he was on the boat?

03:40:31.952 --> 03:40:33.919
TALIESIN: I think so.
LIAM: Maybe at the last second,

03:40:33.919 --> 03:40:36.155
you just hucked him back on deck.

03:40:38.137 --> 03:40:40.702
MARISHA: That water is two degrees celsius.

03:40:40.702 --> 03:40:42.702
TRAVIS: To be fair, Underwater Breathing

03:40:42.702 --> 03:40:44.672
can be on up to 10 people, so.

03:40:44.672 --> 03:40:46.735
LAURA: No, he would die from the cold.

03:40:46.735 --> 03:40:48.602
LIAM: I mean, Otter Pops are really good.

03:40:48.602 --> 03:40:50.627
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:40:50.627 --> 03:40:52.843
TRAVIS: (high-pitched Sprinkle voice) Let it be now.

03:40:52.843 --> 03:40:54.952
MATT: Let's say for the purposes of the narrative,

03:40:54.952 --> 03:40:57.422
Sprinkle, not being a fan of the cold ocean,

03:40:57.422 --> 03:41:00.262
leapt from your shoulders before you leapt overboard.

03:41:00.262 --> 03:41:01.095
LAURA: I like it.

03:41:01.095 --> 03:41:02.322
MATT: Okay.

03:41:02.322 --> 03:41:03.822
TRAVIS: (Sprinkle voice) Never return.

03:41:03.822 --> 03:41:05.581
(laughter)
MATT: In concentrating,

03:41:05.581 --> 03:41:07.762
in sitting below decks,

03:41:07.762 --> 03:41:09.552
setting up your ritual to reach out

03:41:09.552 --> 03:41:11.813
to the whereabouts of Mollymauk

03:41:11.813 --> 03:41:16.763
and focusing, the Traveler comes,

03:41:16.763 --> 03:41:18.696
Artagan, taking your hands.
LAURA: Sprinkle sitting in the corner,

03:41:18.696 --> 03:41:19.804
going, "Fuck you."

03:41:19.804 --> 03:41:22.653
(laughter)

03:41:22.653 --> 03:41:24.453
MATT: You're just like, "Uh."

03:41:26.942 --> 03:41:30.632
You focus for a moment and the path is cloudy.

03:41:30.632 --> 03:41:34.762
After a few seconds further pushing there is resistance

03:41:34.762 --> 03:41:37.079
and the Traveler whispers in your ear,

03:41:37.079 --> 03:41:38.132
"Terribly sorry, dear.

03:41:38.132 --> 03:41:40.939
"It seems that he's a bit slippery today."

03:41:42.302 --> 03:41:43.327
LAURA: Oh no.

03:41:43.327 --> 03:41:44.627
Do you think he's onto us?

03:41:45.649 --> 03:41:47.227
MATT: "I couldn't tell you that,

03:41:47.227 --> 03:41:50.832
"but do know the divination does not always succeed.

03:41:50.832 --> 03:41:54.982
"Magic is imperfect at distances, but perhaps another day."

03:41:54.982 --> 03:41:55.982
LAURA: All right.

03:41:57.632 --> 03:41:58.465
MATT: Okay.

03:41:58.465 --> 03:42:03.372
So, roll for the next day, Captain,

03:42:03.372 --> 03:42:05.578
or somebody else, if you'd like to.

03:42:05.578 --> 03:42:07.215
LAURA: Always Captain. Do it, Captain.

03:42:07.215 --> 03:42:09.316
TALIESIN: Captain always.

03:42:09.316 --> 03:42:11.127
SAM: Tusktooth.
TRAVIS: You fucker.

03:42:11.977 --> 03:42:13.435
Six.

03:42:13.435 --> 03:42:14.268
MATT: Six.

03:42:17.882 --> 03:42:20.352
As you guys continue on in this day,

03:42:20.352 --> 03:42:23.422
one of the individuals off the

03:42:23.422 --> 03:42:25.022
side of the ship begins to call,

03:42:25.989 --> 03:42:29.936
"Oh Cap'n! Cap'n, there's something in the water!"

03:42:31.079 --> 03:42:33.169
And they all look over.

03:42:33.169 --> 03:42:37.432
"All right, man the ballista. Something's following."

03:42:37.432 --> 03:42:39.152
SAM: Ah, shit.

03:42:39.152 --> 03:42:40.172
TRAVIS: Something's following?

03:42:40.172 --> 03:42:41.005
MATT: Yeah.

03:42:42.032 --> 03:42:44.712
TRAVIS: I'll run up to the stern of the ship.

03:42:44.712 --> 03:42:46.162
MATT: You glance over and you can see they're pointing

03:42:46.162 --> 03:42:48.832
off to the side. Maybe about 60 or so feet in the water,

03:42:48.832 --> 03:42:50.752
there is something large,

03:42:50.752 --> 03:42:52.472
about 10 feet below the surface

03:42:52.472 --> 03:42:54.252
that is just swimming alongside.

03:42:54.252 --> 03:42:57.716
It's causing a slight bow in the water surface,

03:42:57.716 --> 03:43:00.012
and there is a bit of a trail behind it, left in its wake.

03:43:00.012 --> 03:43:01.162
TRAVIS: Couldn't be.

03:43:04.082 --> 03:43:05.115
Caduceus!

03:43:05.115 --> 03:43:06.122
TALIESIN: Yeah?

03:43:06.122 --> 03:43:07.472
TRAVIS: Come take a look, please.

03:43:08.452 --> 03:43:10.050
TALIESIN: Well, that's weird.

03:43:10.050 --> 03:43:11.419
TRAVIS: What do you think that is?

03:43:11.419 --> 03:43:13.622
TALIESIN: Some sort of weird rise in the water.

03:43:13.622 --> 03:43:15.532
MATT: Yes, no, I gathered as much.

03:43:15.532 --> 03:43:17.707
What do you think is causing it?

03:43:17.707 --> 03:43:18.890
TALIESIN: ("I don't know" sound)

03:43:18.890 --> 03:43:20.940
(laughter)

03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:22.039
MATT: Do you want to roll a perception check?

03:43:22.039 --> 03:43:22.872
TALIESIN: Sure.

03:43:25.462 --> 03:43:28.272
Give myself advantage because, you know, I can.

03:43:28.272 --> 03:43:30.280
I'm taking my time.

03:43:30.280 --> 03:43:32.012
TRAVIS: (chuckles) "Taking my time."

03:43:32.012 --> 03:43:33.640
TALIESIN: That's terrible. 18.

03:43:34.572 --> 03:43:35.405
MATT: 18?

03:43:35.405 --> 03:43:37.742
TALIESIN: 18's terrible for me.
MATT: It's not hiding itself.

03:43:37.742 --> 03:43:39.412
You can't make out all the details of it,

03:43:39.412 --> 03:43:43.252
but you can see a dull gray mass

03:43:43.252 --> 03:43:46.867
that is swimming in pace with the ship.

03:43:48.062 --> 03:43:49.222
You can make out some of the shape.

03:43:49.222 --> 03:43:50.384
Make a nature check for me.

03:43:50.384 --> 03:43:52.242
TALIESIN: Ooh, this'll go poorly.

03:43:54.242 --> 03:43:55.162
14.

03:43:55.162 --> 03:43:58.515
MATT: 14. You have no idea what the hell this thing is.

03:44:01.132 --> 03:44:03.652
TALIESIN: It's just pacing us? It doesn't seem to be--

03:44:03.652 --> 03:44:04.752
MATT: At the moment, yeah.

03:44:05.852 --> 03:44:08.992
TALIESIN: All right, just keep an eye on it, I guess.

03:44:08.992 --> 03:44:10.522
MATT: You can see they're shifting the ballista

03:44:10.522 --> 03:44:12.212
over to that side of the ship

03:44:12.212 --> 03:44:13.203
and they're starting to get it

03:44:13.203 --> 03:44:15.444
mounted up and ready to fire.
TRAVIS: Captain, if I could ask,

03:44:15.444 --> 03:44:18.522
is it your intention to fire while being unprovoked?

03:44:18.522 --> 03:44:21.002
Or only if it attacks?

03:44:21.002 --> 03:44:22.462
MATT: "Rightly so, we're going to go ahead

03:44:22.462 --> 03:44:24.212
"and make sure it does not make

03:44:24.212 --> 03:44:26.692
"any aggressive actions without retaliation.

03:44:26.692 --> 03:44:28.659
"We're just keeping an eye."

03:44:28.659 --> 03:44:31.293
TRAVIS: Fair enough.
LAURA: How big of a-- is it?

03:44:32.132 --> 03:44:32.965
MATT: From what you can tell,

03:44:32.965 --> 03:44:36.972
it's probably about 15 to 20 feet from side to side

03:44:36.972 --> 03:44:39.852
and close to 50 to 60 feet front to back.

03:44:39.852 --> 03:44:42.476
TRAVIS: Oh my god, what is that?

03:44:42.476 --> 03:44:45.082
LAURA: Can I call out to it?
LIAM: Whale.

03:44:45.082 --> 03:44:47.714
MATT: Sure, what do you say?

03:44:47.714 --> 03:44:51.265
LAURA: Oy! Why are you following us?

03:44:52.362 --> 03:44:54.292
TALIESIN: I can do it. It'll actually--

03:44:54.292 --> 03:44:55.722
Hey, do you need anything?

03:44:55.722 --> 03:44:57.312
Are you all right?

03:44:57.312 --> 03:45:00.022
It can understand me, so I figured--

03:45:00.022 --> 03:45:04.028
MATT: As you shout, make a persuasion check.

03:45:04.028 --> 03:45:05.736
TRAVIS: (rapid impacts) (groans)

03:45:09.092 --> 03:45:10.315
TALIESIN: 13.

03:45:10.315 --> 03:45:12.332
MATT: 13, okay.

03:45:12.332 --> 03:45:14.282
It begins to breach the surface.

03:45:14.282 --> 03:45:17.582
And as you see the upper part of its body,

03:45:17.582 --> 03:45:21.572
the dull gray coloration is actually a thick scaled hide

03:45:21.572 --> 03:45:24.182
over a humped shoulder

03:45:24.182 --> 03:45:26.492
that you can see these heavy flippers

03:45:26.492 --> 03:45:28.534
that push through. In fact, there are multiple sets:

03:45:28.534 --> 03:45:31.222
three sets, six total, large flippers

03:45:31.222 --> 03:45:32.892
that start large at the back

03:45:32.892 --> 03:45:36.902
and slowly descend in size to the base.

03:45:36.902 --> 03:45:40.772
This almost Plesiosaur-type neck and head

03:45:40.772 --> 03:45:43.132
begins to emerge from the top.

03:45:43.132 --> 03:45:45.352
You have not seen a creature like this before.

03:45:45.352 --> 03:45:46.555
You can roll a nature check, if you'd like.

03:45:46.555 --> 03:45:47.388
LAURA: Okay!

03:45:50.315 --> 03:45:53.127
Ooh, a 19.

03:45:53.127 --> 03:45:55.592
I've seen something like this in my storybooks.

03:45:55.592 --> 03:45:57.240
MATT: This is a cetus.

03:45:57.240 --> 03:45:58.490
LAURA: It's a cetus!

03:45:59.712 --> 03:46:03.222
MATT: They are an extremely rare sea creature

03:46:03.222 --> 03:46:06.602
that-- it's rare to the point where

03:46:06.602 --> 03:46:10.912
it's largely used as a myth to scare sailors,

03:46:10.912 --> 03:46:14.882
to warn people of territorial beasts

03:46:14.882 --> 03:46:17.955
that live in the furthest-off parts of the ocean.

03:46:19.172 --> 03:46:20.882
They are territorial,

03:46:20.882 --> 03:46:22.192
and this one appears to have

03:46:22.192 --> 03:46:24.782
some sort of an albino coloration to it,

03:46:24.782 --> 03:46:26.845
as its eyes are a bright pink red,

03:46:27.682 --> 03:46:29.272
and as its head emerges

03:46:29.272 --> 03:46:30.312
and looks up in your direction,

03:46:30.312 --> 03:46:33.062
you can see it glances up at you

03:46:33.062 --> 03:46:34.542
with a hint of intelligence,

03:46:34.542 --> 03:46:36.442
though you're uncertain of its intent.

03:46:38.052 --> 03:46:40.412
TALIESIN: Do we have anybody who can talk?

03:46:40.412 --> 03:46:42.232
We're going to see if you need anything.

03:46:42.232 --> 03:46:43.292
We're going to try and figure out

03:46:43.292 --> 03:46:46.462
if we can understand you, give us a second.

03:46:46.462 --> 03:46:48.862
LAURA: Do I remember in my storybooks

03:46:48.862 --> 03:46:51.672
what it likes to eat or anything?

03:46:52.562 --> 03:46:54.165
MATT: You're not terribly certain.

03:46:55.960 --> 03:46:57.012
Unfortunately, with that roll,

03:46:57.012 --> 03:47:00.842
you're not able to to pick up the specific details

03:47:00.842 --> 03:47:02.522
of a creature like this' lifestyle.

03:47:02.522 --> 03:47:04.189
You just know what it is.

03:47:04.189 --> 03:47:05.614
It's rare enough to the point where

03:47:05.614 --> 03:47:07.104
you'd have to roll higher to learn that information.

03:47:07.104 --> 03:47:10.382
LIAM: Caleb is going to pull out his raven's feather

03:47:10.382 --> 03:47:13.292
and cast Fly and fly out maybe

03:47:13.292 --> 03:47:15.082
40 or 50 feet above the water.

03:47:15.082 --> 03:47:17.969
MATT: Okay. The head traces you as you get close.

03:47:17.969 --> 03:47:21.492
You hear this dull rumbling gurgle

03:47:21.492 --> 03:47:23.342
that sounds like a growl.

03:47:23.342 --> 03:47:25.158
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to--

03:47:25.158 --> 03:47:26.299
MATT: (growls)

03:47:26.299 --> 03:47:28.690
LIAM: -- Polymorph myself into it.

03:47:30.902 --> 03:47:31.735
MATT: Okay.

03:47:34.992 --> 03:47:37.122
Okay, above it?

03:47:37.122 --> 03:47:38.842
LIAM: No. No, no, no.

03:47:38.842 --> 03:47:41.322
Space so that I could swan dive

03:47:41.322 --> 03:47:44.282
maybe 50 feet away from it.

03:47:44.282 --> 03:47:47.815
I'm not trying to body slam it.
MATT: So you Polymorph into it.

03:47:48.922 --> 03:47:51.272
Much like the whales in "Hitchhiker's Guide,"

03:47:51.272 --> 03:47:53.290
you just plummet from the air for a second before

03:47:53.290 --> 03:47:54.123
(splashing)

03:47:54.123 --> 03:47:56.912
Not quite as horrible an impact as in "Hitchhiker's,"

03:47:56.912 --> 03:48:00.632
but you hit the water and watch as the creature

03:48:00.632 --> 03:48:04.952
about face suddenly, and turns the head.

03:48:04.952 --> 03:48:06.622
TALIESIN: So we can talk, hold on.

03:48:06.622 --> 03:48:09.452
LIAM: I start to flirt, visually flirt.

03:48:11.782 --> 03:48:15.892
MATT: Okay, its first action is defensive.

03:48:15.892 --> 03:48:16.725
TRAVIS: Territorial.

03:48:17.702 --> 03:48:20.802
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check.

03:48:20.802 --> 03:48:23.492
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to try to just roll over in the water.

03:48:23.492 --> 03:48:25.742
MATT: Correct. The charisma bonus on this as a plus one.

03:48:25.742 --> 03:48:26.812
TRAVIS: Do you show your belly?

03:48:26.812 --> 03:48:28.453
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. Like Sprigg.

03:48:31.562 --> 03:48:33.832
I don't know what the bonus would be,

03:48:33.832 --> 03:48:35.133
but I rolled a 10.

03:48:36.062 --> 03:48:36.895
MATT: Okay, okay.

03:48:36.895 --> 03:48:41.155
A 10 will not incite aggressive action.

03:48:42.997 --> 03:48:44.622
It is no longer chasing the boat,

03:48:44.622 --> 03:48:46.972
but it is looking towards you

03:48:46.972 --> 03:48:48.122
and keeping a distance

03:48:48.122 --> 03:48:49.570
and is now in the process of

03:48:49.570 --> 03:48:53.012
gauging what you are here to do.

03:48:53.012 --> 03:48:56.672
Roll a d20 and add two for your perception check with it.

03:48:57.817 --> 03:49:00.252
LIAM: 20, dirty 20.

03:49:00.252 --> 03:49:03.968
MATT: With that, you notice

03:49:03.968 --> 03:49:06.262
below the water, near it,

03:49:06.262 --> 03:49:10.602
two smaller forms, similar coloration,

03:49:10.602 --> 03:49:14.655
but no more than maybe 10 feet across, 25 foot in length.

03:49:15.582 --> 03:49:18.032
You get the sense that this is a mother.

03:49:18.032 --> 03:49:19.952
LIAM: So I'm not going to get any closer.

03:49:19.952 --> 03:49:21.532
I'm going to stay the same distance away

03:49:21.532 --> 03:49:26.175
but I'm going to try to swim playfully around the family.

03:49:27.742 --> 03:49:29.342
Absolutely the indication is that

03:49:29.342 --> 03:49:32.012
I'm being silly as a creature with them.

03:49:32.012 --> 03:49:32.845
MATT: All right.

03:49:34.362 --> 03:49:38.162
The mother appears untrusting,

03:49:38.162 --> 03:49:40.412
but is not taking it as an aggressive action.

03:49:43.922 --> 03:49:47.332
Interesting point, between your physicality

03:49:47.332 --> 03:49:49.592
and the physicality of this creature:

03:49:49.592 --> 03:49:54.371
it appears more sallow than you.
LIAM: Sallow?

03:49:54.371 --> 03:49:55.302
Oh, okay.

03:49:55.302 --> 03:49:56.602
MATT: Thin, gaunt.

03:49:56.602 --> 03:49:58.412
LAURA: Oh, it's hungry.

03:49:58.412 --> 03:50:00.932
MATT: And based on the proximity to the ship

03:50:00.932 --> 03:50:04.542
and the arrangement of this pod

03:50:04.542 --> 03:50:07.752
you gather their interest with the large,

03:50:07.752 --> 03:50:10.502
moving barge of a ship that you are currently riding on

03:50:12.372 --> 03:50:14.302
is because they're looking for food.

03:50:14.302 --> 03:50:15.268
LIAM: Okay.

03:50:15.268 --> 03:50:18.184
ASHLEY: Can I kick off any bit of the

03:50:18.184 --> 03:50:20.522
mage body into the water?

03:50:20.522 --> 03:50:22.922
Did we already do that?

03:50:22.922 --> 03:50:24.470
MATT: They didn't leave it on there for three days.

03:50:24.470 --> 03:50:26.512
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, it's been three days.

03:50:26.512 --> 03:50:29.104
MATT: Like, "That'll come in handy later."

03:50:29.104 --> 03:50:31.445
Yeah, that's already been thrown in underwater.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:50:31.445 --> 03:50:33.622
MATT: And for that purpose the only person that knows

03:50:33.622 --> 03:50:35.452
of this creature's current intent would be Caleb.

03:50:35.452 --> 03:50:36.712
So you would have to convey that to the party.

03:50:36.712 --> 03:50:38.802
You guys right now are just watching

03:50:38.802 --> 03:50:41.354
as the ship is making more distance between

03:50:41.354 --> 03:50:43.332
you and the creature and Caleb.

03:50:43.332 --> 03:50:45.932
Just hoping that this doesn't go poorly.

03:50:45.932 --> 03:50:48.172
LIAM: So if I'm in this thing's form

03:50:48.172 --> 03:50:50.242
am I able to communicate, then?

03:50:50.242 --> 03:50:51.428
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:50:51.428 --> 03:50:52.469
LIAM: So I'm going to try to say:

03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:55.932
Hungry? Hungry? Hungry? Hungry?

03:50:55.932 --> 03:50:58.021
MATT: It responds with a series of clicking

03:50:58.021 --> 03:51:01.479
and deep gurgling, rattling sounds from within its throat

03:51:01.479 --> 03:51:04.305
and you interpret it to mean,

03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:10.429
"Yes, but why do you help?"

03:51:13.952 --> 03:51:18.492
LIAM: I will roll a couple flips in the water

03:51:18.492 --> 03:51:21.672
and smile as this creature's version of smiling

03:51:23.013 --> 03:51:26.448
and try to say "wait" through gurgle.

03:51:26.448 --> 03:51:29.072
(gurgling)

03:51:29.072 --> 03:51:32.042
MATT: Its head cocks to one side,

03:51:32.042 --> 03:51:33.442
the children now emerge for air.

03:51:33.442 --> 03:51:35.476
They're going to come up.

03:51:35.476 --> 03:51:37.142
LAURA: Babies!

03:51:39.025 --> 03:51:40.542
MATT: And the mother takes one of

03:51:40.542 --> 03:51:41.922
the heavy flippers in the front

03:51:41.922 --> 03:51:43.062
and pushes them to the back

03:51:43.062 --> 03:51:44.692
to keep them protected.

03:51:44.692 --> 03:51:46.842
And just head cocks to the side again once more.

03:51:46.842 --> 03:51:49.192
She's waiting.

03:51:49.192 --> 03:51:51.542
LIAM: So I'll crest to the surface and (splashing)

03:51:51.542 --> 03:51:52.721
My head comes up and I swivel around

03:51:52.721 --> 03:51:55.262
and look for the big pink cow guy

03:51:55.262 --> 03:51:57.822
that I kind of remember and know.

03:51:57.822 --> 03:51:58.655
MATT: Okay.

03:51:58.655 --> 03:52:01.482
LIAM: I will gurgle at Caduceus and try to communicate.

03:52:01.482 --> 03:52:02.532
TALIESIN: I can't understand.

03:52:02.532 --> 03:52:03.892
LIAM: Hungry.

03:52:03.892 --> 03:52:05.472
TALIESIN: I don't know what you're--

03:52:05.472 --> 03:52:06.922
You can understand me, but I--

03:52:08.422 --> 03:52:10.513
Can you mime it?

03:52:10.513 --> 03:52:12.130
LIAM: (gurgling)

03:52:12.130 --> 03:52:13.252
(munching)

03:52:13.252 --> 03:52:15.072
TALIESIN: Oh, food?

03:52:15.072 --> 03:52:17.522
LIAM: (gurgling)

03:52:17.522 --> 03:52:18.355
TALIESIN: What do you eat?

03:52:20.732 --> 03:52:21.652
LIAM: Back to the family.

03:52:21.652 --> 03:52:23.202
TRAVIS: They hungry?

03:52:23.202 --> 03:52:24.035
TALIESIN: I think.

03:52:24.035 --> 03:52:26.072
TRAVIS: I suppose I could summon a greater demon

03:52:26.072 --> 03:52:27.456
for them to chew on.

03:52:27.456 --> 03:52:29.883
SAM: You'd have to kill it first, right?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:52:29.883 --> 03:52:32.545
TRAVIS: Well, no. I mean, the barlgura doesn't really swim.

03:52:33.892 --> 03:52:35.702
I mean, yeah, they'd have to kill it first, yes.

03:52:35.702 --> 03:52:36.535
But just drop it in the water.

03:52:36.535 --> 03:52:38.652
MATT: You do recall from previous experiences

03:52:38.652 --> 03:52:41.321
in which demons you've killed and/or summoned died,

03:52:41.321 --> 03:52:43.792
their bodies quickly turned to an ashy sludge

03:52:43.792 --> 03:52:45.092
and were burned away.

03:52:45.092 --> 03:52:47.594
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we could swim away in that time.

03:52:47.594 --> 03:52:48.427
(laughter)

03:52:48.427 --> 03:52:51.792
SAM: We did buy a bunch of fancy rations for ourselves.

03:52:51.792 --> 03:52:53.460
We've probably eaten half of them,

03:52:53.460 --> 03:52:55.882
but we could just dump the rest.
LAURA: We can Create Food and Water for ourselves

03:52:55.882 --> 03:52:57.652
and give them the tasty stuff we bought.

03:52:57.652 --> 03:52:59.522
SAM: We bought mostly fish, I think.

03:52:59.522 --> 03:53:00.612
LAURA: Yeah.

03:53:00.612 --> 03:53:01.972
I'm going to grab some of my fish.

03:53:01.972 --> 03:53:03.822
TALIESIN: Would you know what you want to eat anyway?

03:53:03.822 --> 03:53:05.489
SAM: Yeah, let's toss some fish.

03:53:05.489 --> 03:53:07.680
Ooh! Why don't just paint--

03:53:07.680 --> 03:53:09.792
LAURA: (gasps) The pastries!
SAM: Oh, I was going to say

03:53:09.792 --> 03:53:12.422
paint a giant fish.
TALIESIN: I don't know if that'll survive the water.

03:53:12.422 --> 03:53:13.255
LAURA: Huh?

03:53:13.255 --> 03:53:15.010
TALIESIN: I think if they got wet, they're no longer pastries.

03:53:15.010 --> 03:53:17.122
LAURA: Well, I'm going to try to
throw it so they'll catch it.

03:53:17.122 --> 03:53:18.176
TALIESIN: They're not going to--

03:53:18.176 --> 03:53:20.682
LAURA: Like ducks at the lake.
SAM: They don't eat bread.

03:53:20.682 --> 03:53:23.900
TALIESIN: Ducks actually shouldn't
eat bread, that's bad for-- oh.

03:53:23.900 --> 03:53:27.250
LIAM: The Caleb cetus is, like, 1950s synchronized swimmer

03:53:27.250 --> 03:53:29.387
just swimming back and forth

03:53:29.387 --> 03:53:32.022
between the ship and this family.

03:53:32.022 --> 03:53:34.072
Just to keep things light and friendly.

03:53:34.072 --> 03:53:36.012
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Not good for ducks.

03:53:36.012 --> 03:53:38.482
SAM: There's nothing that calms a nervous mother

03:53:38.482 --> 03:53:39.981
like an erratic man.

03:53:39.981 --> 03:53:41.429
LIAM: Not right on top of it.

03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:44.004
I'm 70 or 80 feet away from it.

03:53:44.004 --> 03:53:46.155
TRAVIS: I want to play with your kids.

03:53:46.155 --> 03:53:48.602
MATT: You throw some of these pastries into the water

03:53:48.602 --> 03:53:51.122
and they impact the icy surface.

03:53:51.122 --> 03:53:53.472
You watch as the two children slowly begin

03:53:53.472 --> 03:53:56.422
to pull away from the mother who allows them to

03:53:56.422 --> 03:53:58.912
and they snap them from underneath.

03:53:58.912 --> 03:53:59.745
LAURA: And some fish.

03:53:59.745 --> 03:54:01.852
Some of my fish that I bought.

03:54:01.852 --> 03:54:04.272
TALIESIN: Try a couple fish first.
Don't know if they eat the-- okay.

03:54:04.272 --> 03:54:05.799
MATT: They go right for the fish,

03:54:05.799 --> 03:54:07.142
and the mother seems to react

03:54:07.142 --> 03:54:08.792
to the introduction of fish to this arrangement,

03:54:08.792 --> 03:54:10.512
begins to shift over in the direction.

03:54:10.512 --> 03:54:11.792
The boat has slowed down at this point,

03:54:11.792 --> 03:54:13.492
as the captain's seeing what you're doing.

03:54:13.492 --> 03:54:14.642
LAURA: They like fish!

03:54:14.642 --> 03:54:16.265
SAM: Let's dump all of our food.

03:54:17.139 --> 03:54:20.272
MATT: It will take pretty much all of your rations

03:54:20.272 --> 03:54:21.592
to try and feed this family--
SAM: Do it.

03:54:21.592 --> 03:54:24.262
MATT: -- because they are big creatures.

03:54:24.262 --> 03:54:26.432
But you will be out of food

03:54:26.432 --> 03:54:27.698
for the rest of this journey.

03:54:27.698 --> 03:54:30.132
TRAVIS: Okay, we'll lure them in and then we'll eat them.

03:54:30.132 --> 03:54:34.099
LIAM: I have my boba within my form right now.

03:54:34.099 --> 03:54:36.391
ASHLEY: Can we summon any fishies or anything?

03:54:38.122 --> 03:54:41.912
LAURA: I don't have Create Food today.

03:54:41.912 --> 03:54:43.870
TALIESIN: No, we would have to eat today, but

03:54:45.743 --> 03:54:46.818
I could have it tomorrow.

03:54:46.818 --> 03:54:48.292
It does burn a--

03:54:48.292 --> 03:54:50.072
one of us will burn a spell slot.

03:54:50.072 --> 03:54:50.905
That's okay.

03:54:52.372 --> 03:54:54.012
LAURA: Is there anything else they want?

03:54:54.012 --> 03:54:55.624
I really like them.

03:54:55.624 --> 03:54:58.242
TALIESIN: I think most of our food is--

03:54:58.242 --> 03:54:59.566
MATT: The crew's not going to give up their food.

03:54:59.566 --> 03:55:01.592
LAURA: I'm going to hold out a fish.

03:55:01.592 --> 03:55:05.212
And I want it to take it from my hand so I can pet it.

03:55:05.212 --> 03:55:06.045
MATT: Okay.

03:55:06.942 --> 03:55:10.262
Actually, the children would be too small.

03:55:10.262 --> 03:55:14.892
But make a persuasion check for the mother.

03:55:14.892 --> 03:55:16.052
Actually no, make this animal handling,

03:55:16.052 --> 03:55:17.196
this is what this'll be.

03:55:17.196 --> 03:55:18.396
TALIESIN: Even better.

03:55:18.396 --> 03:55:20.904
TRAVIS: Remember the dinosaur movie, "Baby" from the 80s?

03:55:20.904 --> 03:55:21.737
LAURA: Ooh!

03:55:24.683 --> 03:55:25.516
21!

03:55:26.822 --> 03:55:27.802
MATT: As the children are now below

03:55:27.802 --> 03:55:32.722
making these strange (trilling) sounds

03:55:32.722 --> 03:55:35.862
the mother swims up alongside the slow ship.

03:55:35.862 --> 03:55:40.189
The head rises up and comes eye line with you.

03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:43.055
And the head is about

03:55:43.055 --> 03:55:46.230
seven to 10 feet from edge to edge.

03:55:46.230 --> 03:55:47.882
The eyes are bulbous at the top

03:55:47.882 --> 03:55:50.212
just based on the proximity

03:55:50.212 --> 03:55:51.332
and the perspective that you have

03:55:51.332 --> 03:55:52.539
as a much smaller creature.

03:55:52.539 --> 03:55:55.202
And as it comes up, suddenly these two slits

03:55:55.202 --> 03:55:56.078
in the front of the nose.

03:55:56.078 --> 03:55:58.682
(inhales sharply)

03:55:58.682 --> 03:56:00.192
Sniff towards the fish.

03:56:00.192 --> 03:56:01.186
And as it does, you feel your hair.

03:56:01.186 --> 03:56:02.772
(exhales sharply)

03:56:02.772 --> 03:56:04.052
Towards it.

03:56:04.052 --> 03:56:05.742
You hold the fish out.

03:56:05.742 --> 03:56:08.919
The mouth opens and you can see

03:56:08.919 --> 03:56:13.245
rows and rows and rows of jagged, sharp teeth.

03:56:14.715 --> 03:56:17.232
LAURA: Why aren't you getting enough food right now?

03:56:19.502 --> 03:56:21.502
MATT: Lets you pet the nose a bit.

03:56:21.502 --> 03:56:22.335
Do you give the fish?

03:56:22.335 --> 03:56:23.691
LAURA: Yeah.

03:56:23.691 --> 03:56:25.152
MATT: You throw the fish and it touches the tongue.

03:56:25.152 --> 03:56:27.672
As soon as it does the jaw slams shut

03:56:27.672 --> 03:56:29.332
in a way that causes the air to (whooshes)

03:56:29.332 --> 03:56:30.742
blow your hair the other direction for a second.

03:56:30.742 --> 03:56:31.782
And you're like, okay,

03:56:31.782 --> 03:56:34.680
glad you didn't pet that creature's tongue.

03:56:37.352 --> 03:56:38.492
It accepts it.

03:56:38.492 --> 03:56:41.592
It seems disappointed with the volume

03:56:41.592 --> 03:56:43.542
of what it was fed, but it accepted it.

03:56:45.023 --> 03:56:46.954
LAURA: Oh man.

03:56:46.954 --> 03:56:48.025
MATT: What do you do?

03:56:48.025 --> 03:56:49.232
TALIESIN: Well, it's what we got.

03:56:51.502 --> 03:56:52.335
SAM: Bye.

03:56:53.312 --> 03:56:56.800
TALIESIN: We appreciate you letting us pass through there.

03:56:56.800 --> 03:56:59.372
MATT: So you're going to keep your food and keep going.

03:56:59.372 --> 03:57:00.242
SAM: No, we should dump.

03:57:00.242 --> 03:57:02.432
I want to dump all of our rations.

03:57:02.432 --> 03:57:05.322
LAURA: We'll do create food and water for ourselves.

03:57:05.322 --> 03:57:06.241
MATT: Okay.

03:57:06.241 --> 03:57:07.412
LIAM: So giving up all the purchased rations right?

03:57:07.412 --> 03:57:09.462
MATT: To feed these, it will take all of your rations.

03:57:09.462 --> 03:57:11.502
You'll be left with only the ability to feed yourselves.

03:57:11.502 --> 03:57:12.912
You will not eat for the remainder of the day

03:57:12.912 --> 03:57:14.642
and you will have to subsist on spells

03:57:14.642 --> 03:57:16.302
for the next length of the journey.

03:57:16.302 --> 03:57:17.169
You're okay with that?

03:57:17.169 --> 03:57:18.184
LIAM: And boba, I got boba.

03:57:18.184 --> 03:57:20.602
MATT: You got boba, okay.
MARISHA: It's fine.

03:57:20.602 --> 03:57:21.435
MATT: All right.

03:57:21.435 --> 03:57:25.052
The crew stands at first aghast,

03:57:25.052 --> 03:57:26.282
though a few of them seem to be like,

03:57:26.282 --> 03:57:29.282
"This is adorable, but stupid non-sailors."

03:57:29.282 --> 03:57:32.112
Watch you shovel all of your fine purchased food

03:57:32.112 --> 03:57:35.382
from Palebank Village into the mouth of this mother

03:57:35.382 --> 03:57:37.652
and into the ocean around for the children to eat

03:57:37.652 --> 03:57:39.662
until you are out of your reserves,

03:57:39.662 --> 03:57:43.142
but seemingly sated and appreciative

03:57:43.142 --> 03:57:45.272
the creatures eventually peel off

03:57:46.150 --> 03:57:48.035
and then move to the front of the ship.

03:57:49.062 --> 03:57:52.939
And the Captain, after a while, is like,

03:57:52.939 --> 03:57:55.404
"Are they wanting us to follow them?"

03:57:55.404 --> 03:57:56.520
LAURA: Yeah.

03:57:56.520 --> 03:57:57.672
TALIESIN: I think so.

03:57:57.672 --> 03:57:58.905
MATT: "I suppose, I guess so."

03:57:59.862 --> 03:58:01.682
So in following the creatures,

03:58:01.682 --> 03:58:04.222
it leads them through some of the tougher ice fields

03:58:04.222 --> 03:58:06.162
and cuts a day off the journey.

03:58:06.162 --> 03:58:08.562
MARISHA: Cool.
SAM: Nice.

03:58:09.412 --> 03:58:10.982
MATT: Which brings it to one more day.

03:58:10.982 --> 03:58:11.992
Roll for the final roll.

03:58:11.992 --> 03:58:13.082
SAM: ♪ One more day! ♪

03:58:13.082 --> 03:58:15.612
MATT: As you wake up the following morning, they have left,

03:58:15.612 --> 03:58:18.728
but you've made some time back on the trip.

03:58:18.728 --> 03:58:20.562
LAURA: They'll come back, they like us a lot.

03:58:20.562 --> 03:58:21.852
TALIESIN: Do you want Create Food and Water,

03:58:21.852 --> 03:58:23.775
or should I take Create Food and Water?

03:58:26.232 --> 03:58:27.412
TRAVIS: Eight.

03:58:27.412 --> 03:58:28.245
MATT: Eight?

03:58:30.692 --> 03:58:32.852
You hit the ice channel

03:58:32.852 --> 03:58:34.562
that they were trying to help you avoid.

03:58:34.562 --> 03:58:37.582
It does slow you for one further day,

03:58:37.582 --> 03:58:38.712
but only one more day.

03:58:38.712 --> 03:58:41.265
So make one more roll.
SAM: ♪ One more day ♪

03:58:41.265 --> 03:58:42.852
LAURA: (laughing) One more.

03:58:42.852 --> 03:58:46.163
LIAM: ♪ Another roll another ♪
SAM: ♪ Destiny. ♪

03:58:47.342 --> 03:58:48.746
Eight.

03:58:48.746 --> 03:58:50.103
MARISHA: What is it?

03:58:50.103 --> 03:58:51.315
TRAVIS: It's a 10.

03:58:51.315 --> 03:58:52.757
MATT: A 10?
SAM: That's good.

03:58:52.757 --> 03:58:54.052
TRAVIS: The extremes are not good.

03:58:54.052 --> 03:58:55.682
MATT: A strong, chilled wind

03:58:55.682 --> 03:58:58.135
and ocean flow pushes in your favor.

03:58:59.202 --> 03:59:01.982
Two days of the journey are taken away from it.

03:59:01.982 --> 03:59:06.001
So with smooth sailing,
you actually, in half a day's travel--

03:59:06.001 --> 03:59:07.184
SAM: ♪ Half a day ♪

03:59:07.184 --> 03:59:11.482
MATT: -- watch as the ice fog begins to pull away.

03:59:11.482 --> 03:59:14.595
And one of the members of the crew at the front goes,

03:59:15.435 --> 03:59:17.756
"Captain! Land ho!"

03:59:18.652 --> 03:59:20.685
The bell goes off. (bell ringing)

03:59:20.685 --> 03:59:23.324
You all begin to gather at the front of the ship.

03:59:25.312 --> 03:59:28.602
You can see the icy coastline in the

03:59:28.602 --> 03:59:31.432
dark, clouded midday fog as it peels away,

03:59:31.432 --> 03:59:32.832
your vision being able to see

03:59:32.832 --> 03:59:34.762
not just the edge of the water in front of you,

03:59:34.762 --> 03:59:38.092
that has dragged you along this journey

03:59:38.092 --> 03:59:40.752
for the better part of two weeks,

03:59:40.752 --> 03:59:43.312
but you can see dozens of orange,

03:59:43.312 --> 03:59:45.892
glowing dots that signify the torchlight

03:59:45.892 --> 03:59:49.642
in the windows of the ramshackle fort that greets you,

03:59:49.642 --> 03:59:52.572
known as Balenpost.

03:59:52.572 --> 03:59:54.582
10-foot walls of frozen logs

03:59:54.582 --> 03:59:56.402
form around the perimeter,

03:59:56.402 --> 03:59:57.842
while a small gate marking

03:59:57.842 --> 04:00:00.582
the seaside entrance sits there,

04:00:00.582 --> 04:00:01.962
where a small set of docks await

04:00:01.962 --> 04:00:05.158
the arrival of your massive ship.

04:00:06.212 --> 04:00:07.815
Nearing the end of the waters,

04:00:08.922 --> 04:00:10.963
you feel the entire boat lurch.

04:00:10.963 --> 04:00:12.582
(impacting)

04:00:12.582 --> 04:00:17.582
as it makes an impact with the ice wall cliff

04:00:18.112 --> 04:00:22.342
and begins to nestle itself against the dockside.

04:00:22.342 --> 04:00:23.175
The crew begins to gather their

04:00:23.175 --> 04:00:25.152
supplies as anchors are dropped.

04:00:25.152 --> 04:00:26.422
And as you look over the edge,

04:00:26.422 --> 04:00:30.362
you can see the somewhat threadbare crew

04:00:30.362 --> 04:00:32.812
that mans this side begins to swell.

04:00:32.812 --> 04:00:34.782
As you glance up and Vess DeRogna

04:00:34.782 --> 04:00:37.812
stands there on the deck and

04:00:37.812 --> 04:00:39.992
she's doing this with their fingers.

04:00:39.992 --> 04:00:43.065
And as you glance directly above her, you can see

04:00:43.065 --> 04:00:47.774
a conjured illusion of the green tri-diamonds

04:00:47.774 --> 04:00:51.042
that marks the symbol of the Cerberus Assembly.

04:00:53.518 --> 04:00:55.351
And that's where we're going to
go ahead and end today's episode.

04:00:55.351 --> 04:00:56.351
MARISHA: All right.

04:00:57.772 --> 04:00:58.902
MATT: We'll pick up next week,

04:00:58.902 --> 04:01:00.312
with the arrival at Balenpost

04:01:00.312 --> 04:01:03.462
and your true arrival at Eiselcross.

04:01:03.462 --> 04:01:05.062
TRAVIS: We made it, no problem.

04:01:06.495 --> 04:01:08.262
TALIESIN: We got cool toys, too.

04:01:08.262 --> 04:01:10.632
We haven't even done object identifying anything fancy.

04:01:10.632 --> 04:01:11.646
LIAM: Yeah, I forgot about that.
MATT: That's true.

04:01:11.646 --> 04:01:13.795
LIAM: Candy corn on a string.

04:01:13.795 --> 04:01:16.102
MATT: (chuckling)
MARISHA: Woo!

04:01:16.102 --> 04:01:17.132
MATT: All righty.

04:01:17.132 --> 04:01:18.052
TALIESIN: Hey Travis, you're not dead.

04:01:18.052 --> 04:01:18.982
LIAM: Wait, I would've done that.

04:01:18.982 --> 04:01:21.162
I absolutely would've done that.

04:01:21.162 --> 04:01:22.262
What's the candy corn?

04:01:23.297 --> 04:01:25.756
MATT: The candy corn meaning the--?
LIAM: The crystal, the orange crystal.

04:01:25.756 --> 04:01:27.212
TALIESIN: The crystal and the dagger.

04:01:27.212 --> 04:01:28.612
TRAVIS: Oh, that the mage had?
MATT: Right.

04:01:28.612 --> 04:01:29.762
LIAM: Hundred percent would have done that.

04:01:29.762 --> 04:01:34.762
MATT: So the orange crystal is a rough divining stone.

04:01:35.462 --> 04:01:37.242
It is affixed to a specific object,

04:01:37.242 --> 04:01:41.292
but it has to be of the essence of the creator.

04:01:41.292 --> 04:01:44.582
Meaning you can't use it to find <i>any</i>thing.

04:01:44.582 --> 04:01:46.432
It's generally used to discover things

04:01:46.432 --> 04:01:48.122
that once belonged to the owner.

04:01:48.122 --> 04:01:50.412
It's not a specific spell that is, like, crafted.

04:01:50.412 --> 04:01:54.540
This is older and more primal, if that makes any sense.

04:01:54.540 --> 04:01:56.162
And then enchantment is

04:01:57.573 --> 04:02:00.573
oddly vague,

04:02:01.647 --> 04:02:06.140
but it makes sense given the more primal

04:02:06.140 --> 04:02:10.472
and ancient force that perhaps gifted this

04:02:10.472 --> 04:02:11.812
to the entity that clutched it,

04:02:11.812 --> 04:02:13.582
where you met on the deck of the ship.

04:02:13.582 --> 04:02:17.611
LIAM: And I deduce that it was attuned to

04:02:17.611 --> 04:02:18.492
in an effort to find the Cloven Crystal.

04:02:18.492 --> 04:02:20.512
MATT: Correct, and was attuned to the crystal.

04:02:20.512 --> 04:02:21.345
LIAM: Yeah.

04:02:22.192 --> 04:02:23.642
Cool, cool, cool.

04:02:23.642 --> 04:02:27.367
MATT: I will say, because of your intelligence,

04:02:27.367 --> 04:02:28.483
you do discern--

04:02:28.483 --> 04:02:30.099
You know what, actually, roll an investigation check for me.

04:02:30.099 --> 04:02:31.890
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
TALIESIN: Mm.

04:02:34.342 --> 04:02:35.332
LIAM: Investigation, you say?

04:02:35.332 --> 04:02:36.165
27.

04:02:37.082 --> 04:02:40.112
MATT: You deduce, based on the arrival, the crystal,

04:02:40.112 --> 04:02:44.602
and how easily you've traveled on land,

04:02:44.602 --> 04:02:47.345
in parts of land, without this sort of influence,

04:02:48.342 --> 04:02:51.952
this is attuned specifically to the Cloven Crystal

04:02:51.952 --> 04:02:54.802
and only seems to have an effect

04:02:54.802 --> 04:02:58.105
when its proximity is near large bodies of water.

04:03:00.702 --> 04:03:05.643
And you deduce that, seemingly,

04:03:05.643 --> 04:03:07.168
their focus is more on the crystal

04:03:07.168 --> 04:03:08.432
and the ability to follow the crystal,

04:03:08.432 --> 04:03:10.175
than to follow Fjord.

04:03:11.539 --> 04:03:12.372
SAM: Pretty cool.

04:03:14.512 --> 04:03:16.922
MATT: Did you say you wanted to
look up what the dagger was as well?

04:03:16.922 --> 04:03:18.192
LIAM: Well, yeah.

04:03:18.192 --> 04:03:20.022
I would have looked at those, even though you said that

04:03:20.022 --> 04:03:24.282
the runes or the filigree or whatever had disappeared,

04:03:24.282 --> 04:03:26.332
I would still go though the effort.

04:03:26.332 --> 04:03:28.472
MATT: The rapier is just a rapier.

04:03:28.472 --> 04:03:29.305
Whatever enchantment there

04:03:29.305 --> 04:03:31.802
was not within the actual object,

04:03:31.802 --> 04:03:34.492
but instead was a boon granted from an outside force

04:03:34.492 --> 04:03:35.742
that transformed the rapier

04:03:35.742 --> 04:03:37.377
while in the hands of its wielder.

04:03:37.377 --> 04:03:40.869
Not unlike the falchion that was once wielded by Fjord.

04:03:41.742 --> 04:03:44.062
The dagger, however, retains its enchantment,

04:03:44.062 --> 04:03:46.673
and is a nasty, wicked-looking thing.

04:03:47.842 --> 04:03:48.675
You identify that.

04:03:48.675 --> 04:03:49.622
LIAM: Yeah.

04:03:49.622 --> 04:03:52.988
MATT: That is referred to as--

04:03:52.988 --> 04:03:54.904
ASHLEY: (whispered) Dagger, dagger, dagger.

04:03:54.904 --> 04:03:55.987
MATT: There you go.

04:03:57.073 --> 04:04:00.552
Where did I put the sheet?

04:04:00.552 --> 04:04:01.385
Here.

04:04:01.385 --> 04:04:02.218
There is is.

04:04:06.002 --> 04:04:06.882
Wait, no, that's not it.

04:04:06.882 --> 04:04:07.782
Damn it, I'm sorry.

04:04:10.072 --> 04:04:11.238
Just a moment.

04:04:11.238 --> 04:04:12.796
LIAM: I cast Banish on it and--

04:04:12.796 --> 04:04:13.845
LAURA: I have another question.

04:04:13.845 --> 04:04:17.070
TALIESIN: If I recall, Whisper was found on a ship. Anyway.

04:04:18.852 --> 04:04:21.842
MATT: I can't find the object itself right now,

04:04:21.842 --> 04:04:24.332
but I can look it up right now in D&amp;D Beyond

04:04:24.332 --> 04:04:28.136
on my homebrew collection.

04:04:28.136 --> 04:04:31.552
TALIESIN: I believe Whisper was once found on a sunken ship

04:04:31.552 --> 04:04:33.322
or someone sank a ship getting it.

04:04:33.322 --> 04:04:35.442
MATT: It's called the Corecut Dagger

04:04:35.442 --> 04:04:36.832
LIAM: Corecut.

04:04:36.832 --> 04:04:38.416
And it is within your D&amp;D Beyond,

04:04:38.416 --> 04:04:40.072
if you want to look up the specifics of it.

04:04:40.072 --> 04:04:43.292
It is a dark metal blade that is wicked

04:04:43.292 --> 04:04:46.452
and hooked curve that is cold to the touch.

04:04:46.452 --> 04:04:49.672
Has a plus one bonus to attack and damage rolls.

04:04:49.672 --> 04:04:51.472
And when you hit with an attack made with the weapon

04:04:51.472 --> 04:04:54.752
while attuned, you can expend a hit die

04:04:54.752 --> 04:04:57.619
to deal an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

04:04:57.619 --> 04:04:59.172
LIAM: How do you spell corecut?

04:04:59.172 --> 04:05:00.382
TRAVIS: C-O-R-E?

04:05:00.382 --> 04:05:01.232
MATT: Corecut, yeah.

04:05:03.162 --> 04:05:03.995
TALIESIN: Oh, found it.

04:05:05.292 --> 04:05:07.608
LAURA: That's cool.
TRAVIS: 3d6 is no joke.

04:05:09.317 --> 04:05:10.150
MATT: But you have to spend a hit dice

04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:12.060
to do that ability each time.

04:05:13.232 --> 04:05:14.275
LIAM: Oh, interesting.

04:05:15.268 --> 04:05:16.671
Wow.

04:05:16.671 --> 04:05:18.672
TALIESIN: (whistles) Mean.

04:05:18.672 --> 04:05:22.520
MATT: So those items are at your disposal

04:05:24.852 --> 04:05:28.470
and we'll pick up as you arrive here at Balenpost.

04:05:28.470 --> 04:05:30.370
SAM: Exciting.
MATT: Next week.

04:05:30.370 --> 04:05:31.561
Thank you all so much for joining us--

04:05:31.561 --> 04:05:32.452
SAM: Boomerang!

04:05:32.452 --> 04:05:33.532
MATT: Have a wonderful week.

04:05:33.532 --> 04:05:34.472
We love you very much.

04:05:34.472 --> 04:05:35.990
And is it Thursday yet?

04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:37.843
Good night!
(cheering)

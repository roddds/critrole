00:00:00.263 --> 00:00:02.328
MATT: (drawl) Oh hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02.328 --> 00:00:04.474
Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us

3
00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:06.133
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.693
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:10.364
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons, I'm doing it now,

6
00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:11.413
I can't--
MARISHA: Hoo-ah!

7
00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:13.692
MATT: (laughs)

8
00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:15.155
(normal voice) Welcome to our Halloween episode.

9
00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:18.303
(laughter)

10
00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:20.179
It's all sorts of insanity.

11
00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.382
Before we get into our announcements tonight,

12
00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:23.974
we'll just go around the table and say what we are

13
00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:25.518
and show off the costume.

14
00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:26.351
Taliesin.

15
00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:28.475
TALIESIN: I'll start with Sam Riegel, the Invisible Man,

16
00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:30.796
which is very--
MATT: He'll be here shortly.

17
00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.755
LAURA: He's so good.
TALIESIN: He'll shortly be here.

18
00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:34.791
I am Barry Allen, I'm The Flash,

19
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:37.643
I'm the fastest man alive from Injustice 2,

20
00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:38.989
so yeah, here we are.

21
00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.618
MATT: Which, in case you haven't realized,

22
00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:42.222
the theme of this is--
TALIESIN: There's a theme.

23
00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:44.038
MATT: The theme is characters that we've voiced.

24
00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:44.871
LAURA: Yes.

25
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:47.430
MATT: So Taliesin has voiced Barry Allen, The Flash,

26
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.562
which is awesome.
TALIESIN: How you doing?

27
00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:50.404
MATT: Laura.

28
00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:51.479
LAURA: Hello.

29
00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.676
I am Kait Diaz from Gears of War.

30
00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:56.509
TRAVIS: Yeah!

31
00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:58.269
LAURA: Specifically Gears of War 5,

32
00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.630
with this particular ensemble.

33
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.711
TRAVIS: Which is fucking sweet.

34
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.141
MARISHA: It's so good, yeah.

35
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.633
LAURA: What, oh.
TRAVIS: Damn.

36
00:01:05.678 --> 00:01:07.071
Hurt your hand?
LAURA: Yeah, it's legit.

37
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:07.919
I kind of did.

38
00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:10.597
(laughter)

39
00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:11.959
MARISHA: Your titties broke your knuckles.

40
00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.375
LAURA: That's right.

41
00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:17.855
MATT: That's absurdly awesome.
LAURA: It is so, what?

42
00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:19.736
LIAM: Where'd you get that? You handcrafted that, right?

43
00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:23.026
LAURA: Of course, or my friend at Microsoft

44
00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:25.216
was really awesome and sent it.

45
00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:27.290
Blaine, I love you, yeah.

46
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:29.863
MATT: Fantastic.

47
00:01:29.863 --> 00:01:31.232
Over at this table.

48
00:01:31.232 --> 00:01:34.748
LIAM: I'm Gaara,

49
00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:36.843
from the hidden sand village.

50
00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:38.433
(laughter)

51
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.215
I got a gourd.
TRAVIS: You do.

52
00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:41.562
LIAM: In this backpack.

53
00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:44.229
(laughter)

54
00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:48.131
I Manic Panicked my hair for the first time

55
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:49.379
since high school for this bit!

56
00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:50.775
LAURA: Oh my god!
MATT: Yeah!

57
00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:52.183
LIAM: (shouts)

58
00:01:52.183 --> 00:01:53.016
MATT: Good man.

59
00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:54.316
LIAM: That's it.

60
00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:55.318
MATT: Marisha.

61
00:01:55.318 --> 00:01:58.549
MARISHA: So yeah, I thought I would pay homage

62
00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.532
to all the voice over roles

63
00:02:00.532 --> 00:02:04.132
that paid my rent for so long.

64
00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:08.633
You know, could give a shout out to a main character,

65
00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:10.270
but why not some representation.

66
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.517
LAURA: That's right.

67
00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:12.752
MARISHA: For Soldier B.

68
00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:14.370
TRAVIS: That's right.
MATT: Yeah!

69
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.165
MARISHA: We've all been Soldier B.

70
00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:17.698
LAURA: We've all been Soldier B.

71
00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:20.859
MARISHA: With such classic and infamous lines as,

72
00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.598
"Sniper, right up ahead."

73
00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:23.830
(laughter)

74
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.511
Or, "Grenade, 6:00!"

75
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:29.746
Or everyone's other favorite, "Grenade, 8:00!"

76
00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:30.687
TRAVIS: Or?

77
00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:32.270
MARISHA: "Grenade, 12:00!"

78
00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:34.043
MATT: Or?

79
00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:36.235
MARISHA: Or, "I need a medic!"

80
00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:37.404
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

81
00:02:37.404 --> 00:02:38.559
MATT: That's pretty slick.

82
00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.216
TRAVIS: Can you give us three: one close, one medium,

83
00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:41.706
and one long range?

84
00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:43.048
MARISHA: (grunting)
TRAVIS: No, don't, no, don't, no don't.

85
00:02:43.048 --> 00:02:45.352
MARISHA: (groaning)

86
00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:46.941
MATT: There it is, there we go.

87
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:48.411
MARISHA: That's not bad, that's not bad.

88
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:50.178
LAURA: I felt it.
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you.

89
00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:54.626
And thank you, Soldier B, for being the hero of my career.

Batman: The Animated Series.

(laughter)

98
00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:12.914
Either that, or I stuck my hand in the airplane toilet bowl.

99

MATT: Also viable.

100
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.858
TRAVIS: Yeah.

101
00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.207
Just did half my head.

102
00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:18.616
MARISHA: He did this, by the way.

103
00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:20.806
It's killer. I thought he was messing with me.

104
00:03:20.806 --> 00:03:22.619
TRAVIS: Yeah, kids, get a theater degree.

105
00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.183
It's not totally useless.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:26.850
(laughter)

107
00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:30.221
Once a year, you might get to use it.

Sam will be arriving here shortly,

112
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.420
but I'm representing Overwatch,

113
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.052
hello, as McCree,

114
00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:49.258
and it's difficult to sit in this outfit, so.

115
00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:50.250
LAURA: I feel your pain.
MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: Stand, though, did you show it off,

117
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.434
did you show it off?

118
00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:53.658
Because you glow, too.

ALL: Yes!

121

TRAVIS: Oh, sick.
TALIESIN: God damn.

127
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.566
MATT: I didn't bring the flash bangs,

128
00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:14.425
because I figured you wouldn't see them,

129
00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:17.120
but then they made me stand up, so there you go.

130
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.953
But anyway.

131
00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:19.886
TRAVIS: Badass motherfucker.
MATT: Excited to see

132
00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:21.728
what Sam dressed as.

133
00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:22.734
TRAVIS: Yeah.

134
00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:25.234
MATT: Anyway, bringing it back in.

135
00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:28.378
Let's go ahead and get into our announcements tonight

136
00:04:28.378 --> 00:04:30.486
before we start our session.

137
00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:32.832
So we have two sponsors tonight.

138
00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:35.973
First, our friends at Eldritch Foundry

139
00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:38.049
are sponsoring tonight's episode.

140
00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:40.676
For those who aren't familiar, they make super high quality

141
00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:42.931
awesome miniatures on demand that you can customize

142
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:44.400
and print on their website.

143
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.051
They have officially launched their service.

144
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:47.853
They've had some beta going on for a while;

145
00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:49.965
it's now officially launched, you can go check it out,

146
00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:51.874
they provide like, legitimately,

147
00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.993
as the technology progresses for customizing

148
00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:56.239
your role playing game minis and putting them out,

149
00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:59.078
it's the best I've seen so far, it's amazing.

150
00:04:59.078 --> 00:05:00.290
They already have a bunch of options

151
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.153
available on their platform, and continue to add new ones

152
00:05:03.153 --> 00:05:06.251
like warforged, orcs, half-orcs, starting next month,

153
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.507
I think is when they're starting that one up.

154
00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.458
So look for that, and right now you can enjoy

155
00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:11.076
15% off your order when you use the code

156
00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:12.856
critrole, it's back.

157
00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:13.967
ALL: Critrole!

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:15.808
MATT: At checkout on their website,

159
00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:20.329
which is eldritch-foundry.com/critrole.

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:22.349
ALL: Critrole!

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.762
MATT: Check out their website, and thanks so much

162
00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:26.232
for supporting our show.

163
00:05:26.232 --> 00:05:31.232
Next up is the return of our friends, D&amp;D Beyond.

164
00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:32.660
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

165
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.086
MATT: Sam is not here, Liam.

166
00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:36.957
LIAM: Man oh man, what is not to love about D&amp;D Beyond?

167
00:05:36.957 --> 00:05:39.549
We use it, we love it, every rule, every character

168
00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:41.786
at the tip of your fingers, but I got to say,

169
00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:45.105
Sam not being here to sing D&amp;D Beyond's praises,

170
00:05:45.105 --> 00:05:47.280
it just feels off to me, because really,

171
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.300
what a magical combination those two make together,

172
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.419
like Criss and Cross, chocolate and peanut butter,

173
00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.280
Taliesin and ancient Sumerian blood sacrifice.

174
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.164
They co-mingle and make each other better.

175
00:05:59.164 --> 00:06:04.114
So rather than try and fail with some non-Riegel

176
00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:07.186
comedy routine, I just want to make a toast

177
00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:09.051
in their honor. That's it.

178
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.384
Excuse me, one sec.

179
00:06:10.384 --> 00:06:12.029
Oh jeez, my gourd.

180
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.207
Oh jeez.

181
00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:14.735
MARISHA: It's Liam this time.

182
00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:15.758
LIAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

183
00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:17.425
LIAM: Moment of silence.

184
00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.514
TRAVIS: It sounds like a weak fart.
LAURA: Silence.

185
00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:27.481
(wine being aerated loudly)

186
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.700
TRAVIS: That's a big-ass glass of wine.

187
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:47.003
LAURA: Is he going to do the whole bottle?

188
00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:51.836
(wine still aerating loudly)

189
00:07:00.342 --> 00:07:01.516
LAURA: It's not going to be the whole bottle.

190
00:07:01.516 --> 00:07:04.016
It's going to go out the top.

191
00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:06.142
TALIESIN: Oh no, oh no.

192
00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:08.306
MATT: So close.

193
00:07:08.306 --> 00:07:11.974
LIAM: So thank you, Sam, and thank you D&amp;D Beyond

194
00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:14.904
for continuing to support the show.

195
00:07:14.904 --> 00:07:16.566
You can find out more about their wizardry

196
00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:20.861
over at dndbeyond.link/criticalrole.

197
00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:23.054
Cheers, dears.
TRAVIS: All in one, all in one.

198
00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:24.398
LAURA: No.
MARISHA: Chug, chug, chug.

199
00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:25.616
TRAVIS: (groans)

200
00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:27.439
LIAM: Go fuck yourselves.

201
00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.746
(laughter)

202
00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:30.952
TRAVIS: Nice toast.

203
00:07:30.952 --> 00:07:33.430
MATT: Thank you, Liam, and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

204
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.640
Quick reminder, daylight savings time ends

205
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.617
this weekend in the United States.

206
00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:40.535
TALIESIN: And if you don't know what that is,

207
00:07:40.535 --> 00:07:43.552
we are so jealous of you, if you don't know what that is.

208
00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:44.416
MATT: Google it.

209
00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:47.670
So be sure to check out wheniscriticalrole.com

210
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.631
to make sure our broadcast time calculations work for you,

211
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:54.370
if you're not part of that whole weird time change

212
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.285
that makes little sense.

213
00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:58.543
In case you missed our stream yesterday,

214
00:07:58.543 --> 00:08:01.626
I painted one of our favorite NPCs,

215
00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:05.217
Orly Skiffback, which you guys created.
(phone ringtone)

216
00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:06.050
MATT: Ooh.

217
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.982
TALIESIN: My apology.

218
00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:08.354
MATT: That's your tarry, Barry.

219
00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:09.517
LIAM: That's what happens when he speeds up.

220
00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:10.446
TALIESIN: Yep.
LIAM: He's revving up.

221
00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:11.648
TRAVIS: It's the time treadmill.

222
00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:13.838
MATT: But I got to return to form doing oil paints

223
00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:15.721
with Babs Tarr on Pub Draw--

224
00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:18.074
MARISHA: (laughs) Laura's so mad, I'm sorry.

225
00:08:18.074 --> 00:08:20.154
LAURA: It would've sucked with me.

226
00:08:20.154 --> 00:08:21.118
TALIESIN: (laughs)

227
00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:22.890
MATT: I am so rusty.

228
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.488
But if you didn't check it out yet, it's on VOD right now

229
00:08:26.488 --> 00:08:28.101
on our Twitch channel and, subscribers,

230
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:31.811
it'll be available on our YouTube tomorrow morning,

231
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.618
so check it out then.

232
00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:35.256
Marisha, you have some stuff to talk about too.

233
00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:36.089
MARISHA: Yeah.

234
00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:39.027
The very first episode of Mini Prime Time,

235
00:08:39.027 --> 00:08:41.834
with invisible man Sam Riegel.

236
00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:45.828
It is on YouTube for you to check out right now.

237
00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:46.746
LAURA: I love it so much.

238
00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:47.667
TRAVIS: It's so fucking funny.

239
00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:49.046
MARISHA: It's good.

240
00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:51.873
As many of you all have pointed out, it's weird.

241
00:08:51.873 --> 00:08:53.839
TRAVIS: (laughter) Yeah.

242
00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.612
LIAM: You know, I feel like after episode one,

243
00:08:55.612 --> 00:08:57.742
they kind of found their groove and it normalizes.

244
00:08:57.742 --> 00:08:58.575
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

245
00:08:58.575 --> 00:09:00.224
LAURA: Mm, mm.

246
00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:03.108
MARISHA: So next week is Liam's episode.

247
00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:04.117
LIAM: Ooh!
LAURA: Hey.

248
00:09:04.117 --> 00:09:05.958
MARISHA: Going to be enjoying painting Caleb,

249
00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.619
doing some dirt and grime technique.

250
00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:09.279
LIAM: Caleb.
MARISHA: It's good fun.

251
00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.745
And finally,

252
00:09:10.745 --> 00:09:15.453
UnDeadwood Part III airs tomorrow.

253
00:09:15.453 --> 00:09:17.255
(laughter)

254
00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:20.430
November first, seven p.m. on our Twitch channel,

255
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.967
VOD will be immediately available on our Twitch channel.

256
00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:29.354
It'll come out on YouTube on Sunday, which is amazing.

257
00:09:29.354 --> 00:09:32.628
Of course, if you prefer listening to the podcast,

258
00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:36.668
you can catch part two, which released I think today,

259
00:09:36.668 --> 00:09:37.880
or it's releasing yester--
TRAVIS: It's so good.

260
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.339
MARISHA: I think it's there, I don't know,

261
00:09:39.339 --> 00:09:41.235
but it comes out on the podcast network, too.

262
00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:42.938
LIAM: So good.
LAURA: It's really good.

263
00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:44.129
TALIESIN: It's beautiful.

264
00:09:44.129 --> 00:09:46.716
MARISHA: It was a lot of work. (sighs)

265
00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:49.440
LIAM: Do you need a medic?

266
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.449
MARISHA and LAURA: (laughs)

267
00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:52.492
MARISHA: Man down!

268
00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:54.916
MATT: (laughs)

269
00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:55.837
Perfect.

270
00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:56.802
MARISHA: (laughs)

271
00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:59.821
Well, I think, if that's all of our announcements,

272
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:02.007
I think it's time we go ahead and jump into

273
00:10:02.007 --> 00:10:04.116
tonight's special Halloween episode of

274
00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:05.451
(gasping)

275
00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:06.474
Critical Role.

276
00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:09.131
(cheering)

277
00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:10.575
LIAM: McCree!

278
00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:12.533

279
00:10:12.533 --> 00:10:17.477

(dragon roaring)

314
00:11:45.676 --> 00:11:46.736
MATT: And welcome back.

315
00:11:46.736 --> 00:11:49.654
(laughter)

316
00:11:49.654 --> 00:11:51.436
Dammit, all right.

317
00:11:51.436 --> 00:11:55.127
So last we left off,

318
00:11:55.127 --> 00:11:56.734
the Mighty Nein had been

319
00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:59.538
in search of Yussa, an archmage ally of theirs,

320
00:11:59.538 --> 00:12:02.042
that they had gone to after it seemed that

321
00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:04.017
all was nearly lost when it came to their struggle

322
00:12:04.017 --> 00:12:06.988
against Obann, as he races towards some sort of

323
00:12:06.988 --> 00:12:11.062
endeavor in the name of the Angel of Irons.

324
00:12:11.062 --> 00:12:12.532
After discovering that Yussa had vanished

325
00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:15.878
into Heirloom Sphere that you had given him months before,

326
00:12:15.878 --> 00:12:19.064
you made contact with an ally of his named Allura Vysoren,

327
00:12:19.064 --> 00:12:21.675
and then proceeded to go into this sphere,

328
00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:23.665
known as the Folding Halls of Halas,

329
00:12:23.665 --> 00:12:25.325
where a series of inter-dimensional rooms

330
00:12:25.325 --> 00:12:27.993
are connected by a singular twisting tower,

331
00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:31.235
only some of which have been explored.

332
00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:32.831
Following the footsteps of Yussa,

333
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:34.279
you've made your way through multiple chambers,

334
00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:37.020
fought golems, made golems, managed to hunt down

335
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.089
the Permaheart, which was a specific artifact

336
00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:43.306
that maintained the undying nature of the Laughing Hand.

337
00:12:43.306 --> 00:12:44.540
After destroying that--

338
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.750
SAM: Hold it!

339
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.745
(laughter)

340
00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:50.072
SAM: Objection!

341
00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:54.628
LAURA: Oh my god.
(laughter)

342
00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:56.220
TRAVIS: What, what?

343
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.307
SAM: Hold it!

344
00:12:57.307 --> 00:12:58.544
TRAVIS: What?

345
00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:00.476
(laughter)

346
00:13:00.476 --> 00:13:02.314
SAM: Objection!

347
00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:03.936
MATT: There it is.

348
00:13:03.936 --> 00:13:05.529
TRAVIS: Are you Sonic the Hedgehog, what?

349
00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:06.750
(laughter)

350
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.291
SAM: This is not an official Phoenix Wright wig!

351
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:11.837
(laughter)

352
00:13:11.837 --> 00:13:12.985
MARISHA: No, we know.

353
00:13:12.985 --> 00:13:14.241
MATT: We gathered that much, Sam.

354
00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:16.274
LAURA: No, we know.

355
00:13:16.274 --> 00:13:20.497
SAM: I had to <i>hold it</i> while someone glued it down.

356
00:13:20.497 --> 00:13:23.121
LIAM: Did the audience get a full view of your ponytail?

357
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:26.527
SAM: I don't think Phoenix Wright has a ponytail.

358
00:13:26.527 --> 00:13:29.265
But he does now!

359
00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:31.448
TALIESIN: Phoenix Wright has been going through some stuff.

360
00:13:31.448 --> 00:13:33.403
MATT: Yeah.

361
00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:36.088
He hasn't done well after the divorce.

362
00:13:36.088 --> 00:13:37.534
LAURA: My hair actually looks like Kait's,

363
00:13:37.534 --> 00:13:40.351
and then you just do that.

364
00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:41.412
I love it.

365
00:13:41.412 --> 00:13:42.557
SAM: Back to you, Matt!

366
00:13:42.557 --> 00:13:44.178
(laughter)

367
00:13:44.178 --> 00:13:45.901
I only have two lines in the video game!

368
00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:47.622
(laughter)

369
00:13:47.622 --> 00:13:49.092
TRAVIS: Miami trial attorney.

370
00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:50.502
MATT: Thank you, Mr. Wright.

371
00:13:50.502 --> 00:13:53.369
(laughter)

372
00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:57.732
In discovering through some notes that Halas

373
00:13:57.732 --> 00:14:01.080
had been experimenting with cloned bodies

374
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.020
and seemed to have some sort of ritual chamber

375
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.750
somewhere in the dreadnought, which you had

376
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.782
found on the map, you went to investigate this dreadnought

377
00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:11.622
and discovered it was an astral dreadnought

378
00:14:11.622 --> 00:14:16.299
that had been chained down, its eye covered,

379
00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:19.925
and held adrift in the center of the Astral Sea

380
00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:22.507
as via the door you had followed.

381
00:14:22.507 --> 00:14:23.964
You pulled one of these levers, which then

382
00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:27.204
opened the jaws of the astral dreadnought,

383
00:14:27.204 --> 00:14:30.558
and then you all proceeded to step inside of its mouth.

384
00:14:30.558 --> 00:14:31.955
TRAVIS: Come on, man! (laughs)

385
00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.639
Come on, we're okay, right?

386
00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.861
TALIESIN: You say that like that's weird.

387
00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:36.718
LAURA: Choices you make in the dead of the night.

388
00:14:36.718 --> 00:14:37.652
MATT: Look, I ain't judging.

389
00:14:37.652 --> 00:14:39.111
LAURA: Don't seem as wise.

390
00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:43.011
LIAM: Did you know you're dressed as a cowboy?

391
00:14:43.992 --> 00:14:45.631
MATT: (drawl) Believe it or not, I'm well aware.

392
00:14:45.631 --> 00:14:46.953
(laughter)

393
00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:50.009
TRAVIS: He also has a weapon.

394
00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:52.349
MATT: Are you dressed as a sand village weeabo?

395
00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:53.564
LIAM: He's probably not that good a shot.

396
00:14:53.564 --> 00:14:57.005
(laughter)

397
00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:59.718
MATT: So after stepping into this astral dreadnought,

398
00:14:59.718 --> 00:15:02.601
you found yourselves now standing in this cold,

399
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:06.019
natural-seeming cavern, larger in diameter

400
00:15:06.019 --> 00:15:07.715
to where you cannot see the walls around you,

401
00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:11.118
ceiling above you, but a few burning bits of light

402
00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:15.326
in the distance and a small arrangement of furniture.

403
00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:17.291
And that's where we left off.

404
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:20.145
So Mighty Nein, as you now walk into

405
00:15:20.145 --> 00:15:23.211
wherever the interior of the dreadnought sent you,

406
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:24.621
what would you like to do?

407
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:27.209
LIAM: How lit is it in here?

408
00:15:27.209 --> 00:15:28.539
MATT: Where you're standing right now?

409
00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:30.095
Pitch black.

410
00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:31.615
You can see what little bit of light there is,

411
00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:33.374
maybe 100 or so feet ahead of you,

412
00:15:33.374 --> 00:15:36.053
that's illuminating those bits of furniture around.

413
00:15:36.053 --> 00:15:37.345
But that's--
MARISHA: What kind of light does it look like?

414
00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:39.257
Is it like candlelight, or?

415
00:15:39.257 --> 00:15:40.491
MATT: From what you can tell right now,

416
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:43.821
it's brighter than candlelight, more like torchlight,

417
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:46.028
though you do not see the specific sources

418
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.249
of where this light may be.

419
00:15:47.249 --> 00:15:50.318
It could be lanterns or things around the vicinity,

420
00:15:50.318 --> 00:15:51.463
but you're not close enough to make out

421
00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:52.936
specifically the light sources.

422
00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:55.541
LIAM: Are there any sounds whatsoever?

423
00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:57.261
MATT: Make a perception check.

424
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:58.613
LAURA: Oh god.

425
00:15:58.613 --> 00:15:59.783
LIAM: Bah!

426
00:15:59.783 --> 00:16:00.924
TRAVIS: First roll.

427
00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:02.747
SAM: Everybody's costume is so good except for mine.

428
00:16:02.747 --> 00:16:04.005
LIAM: Seven.

429
00:16:04.957 --> 00:16:06.414
Seven.

430
00:16:06.414 --> 00:16:07.363
MATT: Seven.

431
00:16:07.363 --> 00:16:08.341
MARISHA: I mean...

432
00:16:08.341 --> 00:16:10.130
TRAVIS: Looks like somebody hit you with a Goodwill.

433
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.332
SAM: This was $24.99, guys.

434
00:16:13.332 --> 00:16:16.061
(laughter)

435
00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:18.173
And I should've ironed it.
TRAVIS: 22 bucks too much.

436
00:16:18.173 --> 00:16:19.257
LIAM: The hair, yes.

437
00:16:19.257 --> 00:16:20.911
(laughter)

438
00:16:20.911 --> 00:16:22.808
MATT: So with that--
MARISHA: You just catch on fire.

439
00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:24.890
MATT: --you listen intently and hear nothing.

440
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.340
It is still, silent,

441
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.187
an absence of any movement,

442
00:16:30.187 --> 00:16:31.587
sound, or life.

443
00:16:32.578 --> 00:16:33.617
Anybody else?

444
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:35.475
MARISHA: Can we hear each other?

445
00:16:35.475 --> 00:16:37.413
MATT: Do you begin to test that theory?

446
00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.177
MARISHA: I-- (snaps)
TALIESIN: Are you talking out loud, though?

447
00:16:39.177 --> 00:16:40.671
MATT: Yeah, you can hear the snap sound.

448
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:41.521
LAURA: Okay.

449
00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:42.654
TALIESIN: Did you say something?

450
00:16:42.654 --> 00:16:44.454
MATT: You hear Caduceus.
MARISHA: I snapped.

451
00:16:44.454 --> 00:16:45.662
TALIESIN: What?

452
00:16:45.662 --> 00:16:47.589
MARISHA: I snapped.
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

453
00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:49.027
LAURA: You snapped?

454
00:16:49.027 --> 00:16:51.633
Like mentally, like you had a break or something?

455
00:16:51.633 --> 00:16:54.083
TALIESIN: I mean...
MARISHA: Not yet.

456
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:54.916
LAURA: About to.

457
00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.265
TALIESIN: I'm going to light up a bit.

458
00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.132
MATT: Okay.

459
00:16:58.132 --> 00:16:59.756
The light around you expands a bit

460
00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.054
as you cast the Light spell.

461
00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:06.256
For the radius of that, nothing.

462
00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:07.089
TRAVIS: Whoa.

463
00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.589
MATT: Just an absent void of cavern, no walls.

464
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.376
What's the distance on the Light spell?

465
00:17:13.376 --> 00:17:15.473
TALIESIN: Not far.

466
00:17:15.473 --> 00:17:17.712
TRAVIS: Does the floor appear to be like stone or wood or--?

467
00:17:17.712 --> 00:17:18.765
LAURA: Yeah, I was just going to say, I get down

468
00:17:18.765 --> 00:17:19.777
on my hands and knees--
TALIESIN: 20 feet.

469
00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:22.428
MATT: 20 feet, yeah.
LAURA: --and start feeling for the door.

470
00:17:22.428 --> 00:17:24.128
MATT: Okay.

471
00:17:24.128 --> 00:17:25.545
Yeah, if you want to make an investigation check

472
00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.364
to search for the door, the floor appears to be stone,

473
00:17:27.364 --> 00:17:29.709
fairly solid, pretty standard.

474
00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:31.192
LAURA: Thank you, thank you, six.

475
00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:32.488
MATT: Okay.

476
00:17:32.488 --> 00:17:34.596
It's rough in the sense that it looks--

477
00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:38.197
it's not a perfectly polished, flat, marble-like floor.

478
00:17:38.197 --> 00:17:42.299
It looks natural somewhat, but it is flat enough

479
00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:44.184
to appear to have been worked.

480
00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:46.989
TRAVIS: Not paved, but like flattened?

481
00:17:46.989 --> 00:17:48.336
MATT: Yeah.

482
00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:51.562
LIAM: I summon Frumpkin just to my shoulders, like a scarf.

483
00:17:51.562 --> 00:17:52.399
MATT: Okay.

484
00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:54.008
LIAM: Scritch him.

485
00:17:54.008 --> 00:17:56.025
TRAVIS: Hey Nott, do you feel like, you know,

486
00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:59.456
investigating that table and chairs?

487
00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:01.713
LAURA: Carefully, very very carefully.

488
00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:05.652
SAM: Table seems fine, but that chair.

489
00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:08.420
TRAVIS: Don't trust it, not for a minute.

490
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.368
SAM: All right.

491
00:18:09.368 --> 00:18:13.707
I'm going to do a little barrel roll,

492
00:18:13.707 --> 00:18:17.294
shimmy on my hands and knees over to the chair

493
00:18:17.294 --> 00:18:18.634
and investigate it.

494
00:18:18.634 --> 00:18:19.554
MATT: Okay.

495
00:18:19.554 --> 00:18:21.577
As you move forward, you begin to see,

496
00:18:21.577 --> 00:18:23.238
some of the reason you couldn't see the light sources,

497
00:18:23.238 --> 00:18:24.866
since there are actually torch sconces

498
00:18:24.866 --> 00:18:27.361
that are placed on the inside of pillars

499
00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:28.604
that from where you were standing,

500
00:18:28.604 --> 00:18:29.979
were blocking your perspective.

501
00:18:29.979 --> 00:18:31.829
So as you get closer, you can see there are light sources

502
00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:33.612
on the other end of these pillars

503
00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.378
that previously weren't visible

504
00:18:35.378 --> 00:18:37.569
from your entry point.

505
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.048
You made a stealth check, you said?

506
00:18:40.048 --> 00:18:41.338
SAM: No, I'm just shimmying--

507
00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:43.278
MATT: You're just shimmying for the hell of shimmying.

508
00:18:43.278 --> 00:18:46.443
SAM: Yeah, and I'm going to investigate the chair first,

509
00:18:46.443 --> 00:18:48.048
followed by the table.
MATT: Okay.

510
00:18:48.048 --> 00:18:51.152
Well, as you approach.
SAM: Oh, oh shit.

511
00:18:51.152 --> 00:18:52.721
LAURA: We should have made a stealth check.

512
00:18:52.721 --> 00:18:54.717
MATT: You can see now in the space,

513
00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:57.803
it appears to be some form of laboratory.

514
00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.044
SAM: Oh.
MATT: You can see all manner

515
00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:00.910
of strange instruments.

516
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.683
There are three tables that are outfitted

517
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.154
with boxes and strange contraptions.

518
00:19:05.154 --> 00:19:08.931
You can see large glass, almost jars

519
00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:10.660
filled with all manner of implements

520
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.240
and strange objects that might be,

521
00:19:15.165 --> 00:19:17.963
whether they be components or elements of rituals,

522
00:19:17.963 --> 00:19:21.240
it's hard to specifically make out at this distance.

523
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.379
You see a collection of old tomes across one of the tables,

524
00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:27.578
and in the center of the tables, you see a body.

525
00:19:27.578 --> 00:19:29.941
(gasping)

526
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:32.593
SAM: Living body or dead body?

527
00:19:32.593 --> 00:19:34.706
MATT: On the ground laying still.

528
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:37.405
LAURA: It's on the ground?

529
00:19:37.405 --> 00:19:39.216
The body's on the ground next to the table?

530
00:19:39.216 --> 00:19:40.049
MATT: Yeah.

531
00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:44.466
SAM: I will shimmy over to it and see if I can glean

532
00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:47.752
what sort of body it is.

533
00:19:47.752 --> 00:19:48.880
LAURA: Can any of us see it, or is it--

534
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.069
MATT: If you guys are moving ahead with Nott,

535
00:19:51.069 --> 00:19:52.785
then you might be able to, but if you're keeping a distance

536
00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:55.485
and letting Nott go ahead, unstealthily.

537
00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:56.535
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

538
00:19:56.535 --> 00:19:59.661
LIAM: Caleb is at least moving forward somewhat.

539
00:19:59.661 --> 00:20:00.618
TALIESIN: Slowly.

540
00:20:00.618 --> 00:20:01.751
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Same.

541
00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:04.159
MARISHA: We do the creep.
MATT: Okay.

542
00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:05.076
Like the...

543
00:20:06.161 --> 00:20:06.994
Okay.

544
00:20:06.994 --> 00:20:10.309
LIAM: I'm summoning a small mote of fire

545
00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.039
into my hand and holding it.

546
00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:12.872
MATT: All right.

547
00:20:12.872 --> 00:20:14.486
LIAM: To add to Caduceus's light.

548
00:20:14.486 --> 00:20:15.913
MATT: Okay.

549
00:20:15.913 --> 00:20:18.630
As you begin to see the light source of your friends

550
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.745
behind you approach slowly and

551
00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:22.599
help illuminate the space a bit further

552
00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:25.639
as you begin to peer towards this body,

553
00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:28.512
its head is faced away from you.

554
00:20:28.512 --> 00:20:30.649
You can see the feet and the legs from this direction,

555
00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:33.270
arm over and open to one side.

556
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.270
It appears to be dressed in long red robes with gold trim.

557
00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:41.561
The boots are a dark brown leather

558
00:20:41.561 --> 00:20:46.228
wrapped around the foot, a soft sole seems to be within.

559
00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:50.547
You can get closer if you want to make--

560
00:20:50.547 --> 00:20:54.643
SAM: I'm going to shimmy over and look at this fellow.

561
00:20:54.643 --> 00:20:56.682
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Are you going to go stealthily?

562
00:20:56.682 --> 00:20:57.585
SAM: I'm just shimmying.

563
00:20:57.585 --> 00:20:59.862
LAURA: You motherfuck.
TRAVIS: What if he's alive?

564
00:20:59.862 --> 00:21:04.222
SAM: Yeah, then I'll find out. (laughs)

565
00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:05.614
That's the whole point of this.

566
00:21:05.614 --> 00:21:06.514
LAURA: Did we take a rest before--

567
00:21:06.514 --> 00:21:08.079
No, we didn't take a rest before this.

568
00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:10.433
TRAVIS: We did.
LIAM: I thought we did, a long rest.

569
00:21:10.433 --> 00:21:11.746
All full up.
LAURA: Okay.

570
00:21:11.746 --> 00:21:15.015
MATT: You did, you should be, aside from any spells

571
00:21:15.015 --> 00:21:16.948
you cast in the interim, but you guys slept

572
00:21:16.948 --> 00:21:19.462
in the Permaheart study, if I recall.

573
00:21:19.462 --> 00:21:21.524
Well no, you slept in the Golem Workshop,

574
00:21:21.524 --> 00:21:22.532
that's where you did.

575
00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:23.365
LAURA: Okay.

576
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.561
LIAM: Is this laboratory surrounded

577
00:21:25.561 --> 00:21:27.807
on all sides by darkness?

578
00:21:27.807 --> 00:21:30.266
Or does it seem like it extends beyond?

579
00:21:30.266 --> 00:21:32.063
MATT: From what you can see, there are four pillars

580
00:21:32.063 --> 00:21:35.628
that set the perimeter of this laboratory area

581
00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.797
that are about 60 feet, 70 feet from each other,

582
00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.789
corner to corner, and then beyond that,

583
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:43.047
once the light fades, nothing.

584
00:21:43.047 --> 00:21:45.457
LIAM: I pull the wire out while we're still a ways back

585
00:21:45.457 --> 00:21:47.342
and whisper to Nott through it:

586
00:21:47.342 --> 00:21:49.898
Perhaps you should wait till we surround that area

587
00:21:49.898 --> 00:21:51.273
so you're not alone.

588
00:21:52.512 --> 00:21:54.095
SAM: Okay.

589
00:21:55.222 --> 00:21:57.969
LIAM: We split, we have to split around.

590
00:21:57.969 --> 00:21:59.204
MATT: Meanwhile.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

591
00:21:59.204 --> 00:22:02.316
SAM: So I guess I'm holding until they give me

592
00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:04.124
some sort of signal to go.

593
00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:06.316
MARISHA: We flank.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll tap Beau and head right.

594
00:22:06.316 --> 00:22:08.090
MARISHA: I'll head right.

595
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.923
MATT: Okay.

596
00:22:11.587 --> 00:22:13.363
SAM: I guess you'll go left, then.

597
00:22:13.363 --> 00:22:14.828
LAURA: I guess we'll go left.

598
00:22:14.828 --> 00:22:16.692
LIAM: I will stay the center position.

599
00:22:16.692 --> 00:22:18.854
MARISHA: As we creep to the right, I want to

600
00:22:18.854 --> 00:22:21.440
look towards that blackness.

601
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.299
Does it look like this place has walls, or does it just--

602
00:22:26.207 --> 00:22:27.731
MATT: Make a perception check.

603
00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:32.731
TRAVIS: Yeah, and do the pillars extend up to anything?

604
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.882
TALIESIN: Yeah, dude.

605
00:22:33.882 --> 00:22:37.612
TRAVIS: Yo, that was a journey and it fucking paid off.

606
00:22:37.612 --> 00:22:39.656
MARISHA: Natural 20.

607
00:22:39.656 --> 00:22:41.272
MATT: To a total of?

608
00:22:42.118 --> 00:22:43.091
MARISHA: 23.

609
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:44.708
MATT: 23, okay.

610
00:22:46.311 --> 00:22:48.305
Looking into the darkness on all sides,

611
00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:51.055
you do not see any sign of walls.

612
00:22:52.653 --> 00:22:54.513
You catch a couple things.

613
00:22:54.513 --> 00:22:56.457
One, following the pillars upward,

614
00:22:56.457 --> 00:23:01.349
you do see that they seem to just faintly thicken

615
00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:04.609
before they reach the outside of your visual range,

616
00:23:04.609 --> 00:23:07.533
and in between them, atop the ceiling,

617
00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:09.200
is a faint red glow.

618
00:23:11.524 --> 00:23:16.524
Ever so faint, like you barely wouldn't even have noticed it

619
00:23:17.142 --> 00:23:19.816
if you hadn't had eyes as keen as yours.

620
00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:24.649
MARISHA: Like a universal glow coming?

621
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:26.472
Or like a point, like a dot?

622
00:23:26.472 --> 00:23:27.708
MATT: Like a point of light.

623
00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:29.145
You don't know how far it is, because

624
00:23:29.145 --> 00:23:31.006
once the darkness takes in, you begin to lose

625
00:23:31.006 --> 00:23:34.618
any sense of depth, because you don't have any clear images

626
00:23:34.618 --> 00:23:39.618
to gauge that, just this faint dull red glow

627
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.923
on the ceiling in the center of these pillars.

628
00:23:41.923 --> 00:23:46.923
MARISHA: I tap Fjord and point it out.

629
00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:49.651
TRAVIS: I'll slightly call it out.

630
00:23:49.651 --> 00:23:50.996
There's a light.

631
00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.664
Don't touch anything.

632
00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:53.497
TALIESIN: Huh.

633
00:23:54.852 --> 00:23:56.500
LAURA: A light where?

634
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.160
SAM: Over at the Frankenstein house.

635
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.602
MARISHA: Up, it's, psst.

636
00:24:00.602 --> 00:24:02.804
TRAVIS: Straight up, straight up.

637
00:24:02.804 --> 00:24:05.987
TALIESIN: Do we see anything up there, or?
MATT: Following--

638
00:24:05.987 --> 00:24:08.687
MARISHA: No, no, up, you got to keep going though.

639
00:24:08.687 --> 00:24:09.885
You got to keep going.

640
00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:13.025
MATT: Following Beauregard's point, you,

641
00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:16.376
especially you, you two would be able to make out

642
00:24:16.376 --> 00:24:18.410
just that faint bit of a glow.

643
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.726
Most everyone else for the most part

644
00:24:19.726 --> 00:24:20.831
is having a hard time picking out

645
00:24:20.831 --> 00:24:22.465
specifically what it is that you're pointing out.

646
00:24:22.465 --> 00:24:23.476
TRAVIS: I can pretend that I see it.

647
00:24:23.476 --> 00:24:25.276
MATT: You can, yeah, if you want to feel like you belong.

648
00:24:25.276 --> 00:24:27.360
Like part of the rest of the crew.

649
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.193
TRAVIS: I do.

650
00:24:28.193 --> 00:24:29.476
TALIESIN: Any movement, or is it just sitting there?

651
00:24:29.476 --> 00:24:30.406
MATT: It seems static.

652
00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:31.789
LAURA: Are you coming left with me or did you

653
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:33.105
stay back there with Caleb?

654
00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.608
TALIESIN: Oh, I started moving.

655
00:24:34.608 --> 00:24:35.670
I'm moving with you, then.

656
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.891
MATT: As you guys are approaching too,

657
00:24:37.891 --> 00:24:40.257
and Nott, you notice this, the body itself,

658
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:47.364
it's sitting atop a large series of glyphs

659
00:24:47.364 --> 00:24:50.090
that are drawn on the floor in

660
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.825
a combination of black dust that has been

661
00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:56.989
laid in lines and shapes, and a dull

662
00:24:56.989 --> 00:25:01.643
reddish-purple tint, heavy powdered chalk,

663
00:25:01.643 --> 00:25:04.423
that has been used to write and fill spaces between it,

664
00:25:04.423 --> 00:25:06.669
like two sigils are overlapping somewhat.

665
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:09.103
SAM: Are they circular, or are they just random?

666
00:25:09.103 --> 00:25:11.271
MATT: Elements of them appear circular in ways,

667
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:13.414
but because they intersect, it becomes like this

668
00:25:13.414 --> 00:25:15.992
deranged arcane equation.

669
00:25:15.992 --> 00:25:18.148
SAM: Am I on them yet?

670
00:25:18.148 --> 00:25:19.832
MATT: If you want to get closer and inspect.

671
00:25:19.832 --> 00:25:21.536
SAM: Well, they told me to hold, so I'm holding.

672
00:25:21.536 --> 00:25:23.884
MATT: Yes, you're holding.

673
00:25:23.884 --> 00:25:27.923
TALIESIN: Does the body look placed or like it fell?

674
00:25:27.923 --> 00:25:32.922
MATT: Taking a look at it, with your passive perception,

675
00:25:32.922 --> 00:25:35.840
you can see the body as you head around the side,

676
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.126
you guys were slightly moving on the outsides.

677
00:25:38.126 --> 00:25:40.107
LAURA: Yeah, we were left, they were right.

678
00:25:40.107 --> 00:25:44.641
MATT: It looks to be a human man in his mid-50s or so,

679
00:25:46.223 --> 00:25:51.223
ruddy skin with long black hair, trimmed facial beard.

680
00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:55.497
His eyes are a piercing amber color.

681
00:25:56.452 --> 00:25:59.919
He doesn't appear to be decaying,

682
00:26:00.844 --> 00:26:02.437
just not moving.

683
00:26:02.437 --> 00:26:03.327
TRAVIS: Eyes open?

684
00:26:03.327 --> 00:26:06.452
MATT: Eyes open, looks healthy, just--

685
00:26:06.452 --> 00:26:08.549
MARISHA: Doesn't look like Halas?

686
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:12.019
MATT: It looks very very much like the portraits of Halas

687
00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:14.311
you've seen throughout, yes.

688
00:26:14.311 --> 00:26:16.686
LIAM: Is the chest rising and falling?

689
00:26:17.981 --> 00:26:19.764
MATT: I would say you would notice

690
00:26:19.764 --> 00:26:21.402
that the chest is indeed slowly rising and falling.

691
00:26:21.402 --> 00:26:23.110
SAM: Oh.

692
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.163
TRAVIS: Eyes open.
TALIESIN: He's not dead.

693
00:26:25.163 --> 00:26:27.522
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: What do we do?

694
00:26:29.111 --> 00:26:30.203
TRAVIS: (sighs)

695
00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:33.036
MARISHA: What if he's in a meditative state?

696
00:26:33.036 --> 00:26:35.830
SAM: I will take out my little wire and:

697
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:39.287
Are you in position yet, or am I still holding?

698
00:26:39.287 --> 00:26:41.682
You can reply to this message.

699
00:26:41.682 --> 00:26:43.590
LIAM: We are around you.

700
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.888
SAM: To Caleb.

701
00:26:46.644 --> 00:26:47.477
Hmm, what?

702
00:26:47.477 --> 00:26:49.700
TALIESIN: I'm keeping a very careful watch on him.

703
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.783
SAM: So should I go?

704
00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:54.902
LIAM: What can you tell from there?

705
00:26:54.902 --> 00:26:57.705
TRAVIS: Maybe inspect the table and stuff first.

706
00:26:57.705 --> 00:26:59.965
SAM: Dead body on some sigils.

707
00:26:59.965 --> 00:27:00.898
TALIESIN: Not dead.

708
00:27:00.898 --> 00:27:05.044
TRAVIS: Powerful, frozen, charmed,
petrified wizard on the floor,

709
00:27:05.044 --> 00:27:06.294
what do you do?

710
00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:10.868
MARISHA: I don't know, sometimes monks will do this thing

711
00:27:10.868 --> 00:27:15.634
where they go into this astral projection

712
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.121
or something, I don't know.

713
00:27:17.121 --> 00:27:18.692
LIAM: I want to try to sneak closer so I can see

714
00:27:18.692 --> 00:27:22.435
some of what she sees, these sigils she described.

715
00:27:22.435 --> 00:27:25.061
MATT: Okay. You sneak closer, and you can see these symbols

716
00:27:25.061 --> 00:27:27.455
the body is currently laying on top of.

717
00:27:27.455 --> 00:27:28.505
SAM: Hi.

718
00:27:28.505 --> 00:27:30.329
MATT: Can make an arcana check if you'd like to try and--

719
00:27:30.329 --> 00:27:32.946
TRAVIS: Oh my god, what if when we destroyed the Permaheart,

720
00:27:32.946 --> 00:27:35.613
it knocked him on his ass?

721
00:27:38.016 --> 00:27:40.910
LIAM: My streak continues, that is a natural one.

722
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.377
TRAVIS: Projected stage whisper.

723
00:27:44.377 --> 00:27:46.937
MATT: The nature of the symbols drawn eludes you.

724
00:27:46.937 --> 00:27:50.886
They are arcane and ancient, and outside

725
00:27:50.886 --> 00:27:52.602
of your realm of specialty.

726
00:27:52.602 --> 00:27:57.561
SAM: I will cast Mage Hand, and if I'm close enough,

727
00:27:57.561 --> 00:27:58.719
I'm going to...

728
00:27:59.842 --> 00:28:01.938
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

729
00:28:01.938 --> 00:28:02.896
SAM: Poke the body.

730
00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:04.014
MATT: Okay.

731
00:28:04.014 --> 00:28:08.486
As the ghostly hand slowly drifts towards the still body

732
00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:12.519
of what appears to be Halas before nudging it.

733
00:28:14.952 --> 00:28:16.835
No reaction.

734
00:28:19.386 --> 00:28:20.219
SAM: Okay.

735
00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:22.836
That didn't work.

736
00:28:22.836 --> 00:28:24.138
Do you think it's dead?

737
00:28:24.138 --> 00:28:25.350
TRAVIS: Does he have pockets?

738
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.774
LIAM: Caduceus.
LAURA: Nott.

739
00:28:26.774 --> 00:28:27.619
SAM: What?

740
00:28:27.619 --> 00:28:28.899
LAURA: Try tickling him.

741
00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:31.380
SAM: Okay, I will Mage Hand tickle.

742
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.305
MATT: You watch as this ghostly spectral hand

743
00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:40.814
loosely molests the unmoving body of Halas

744
00:28:40.814 --> 00:28:43.272
under the arms, on top of the knee,

745
00:28:43.272 --> 00:28:45.283
pulls a boot off and goes for the bottom of the foot,

746
00:28:45.283 --> 00:28:46.613
behind the knee, sure.

747
00:28:46.613 --> 00:28:48.342
SAM: Does that thing where they crack an egg on the head.

748
00:28:48.342 --> 00:28:49.419
MATT: Right, right.

749
00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:50.748
SAM: Let the yolk run down.

750
00:28:50.748 --> 00:28:52.488
MATT: No reaction at all.

751
00:28:52.488 --> 00:28:54.246
LIAM: Is that a Christopher Lee character?

752
00:28:54.246 --> 00:28:55.821
TRAVIS: Eyes unblinking?

753
00:28:55.821 --> 00:28:57.759
MATT: Eyes unblinking.

754
00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:58.981
MARISHA: But breathing.

755
00:28:58.981 --> 00:28:59.991
MATT: But breathing.

756
00:28:59.991 --> 00:29:01.738
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's like--

757
00:29:01.738 --> 00:29:03.557
LAURA: He's in a trance.

758
00:29:03.557 --> 00:29:05.989
TRAVIS: Or petrified, or--
SAM: I search the pockets.

759
00:29:05.989 --> 00:29:07.386
TRAVIS: Comatose or--

760
00:29:07.386 --> 00:29:09.513
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

761
00:29:09.513 --> 00:29:11.615
LAURA: We could greater restore him or something.

762
00:29:11.615 --> 00:29:12.507
SAM: 16.

763
00:29:13.482 --> 00:29:16.627
MATT: Looking through his pockets, and you see now,

764
00:29:16.627 --> 00:29:18.504
on the table around him, too,

765
00:29:18.504 --> 00:29:22.080
there's numerous things to look for.

766
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.860
In his pockets you find a pouch of gold dust

767
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.538
worth about 550 gold total.

768
00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:29.288
If you want to write that down.

769
00:29:29.288 --> 00:29:30.121
SAM: Sure.

770
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:32.215
MATT: A collection of chalks and inks,

771
00:29:32.215 --> 00:29:34.076
one of which is the piece of chalk

772
00:29:34.076 --> 00:29:35.564
that you can see matches the color

773
00:29:35.564 --> 00:29:39.476
of the reddish-purple hue drawn across the floor,

774
00:29:39.476 --> 00:29:43.377
a pouch of blackened soot that you're not quite sure

775
00:29:43.377 --> 00:29:45.738
what its nature is, but it appears to be

776
00:29:45.738 --> 00:29:47.828
what elements of this circle were built from

777
00:29:47.828 --> 00:29:49.578
outside of the chalk.

778
00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:55.431
That's all that's on him at the moment.

779
00:29:56.365 --> 00:29:59.159
There's the tables around.

780
00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:02.536
LIAM: I'm going to move up behind Nott and cast my--

781
00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:05.153
SAM: Strip this guy naked.

782
00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:06.711
MATT: Ooh, you know what, actually?

783
00:30:06.711 --> 00:30:09.163
You rolled 16 investigation.

784
00:30:09.163 --> 00:30:11.117
About four feet from the corpse,

785
00:30:11.117 --> 00:30:13.790
underneath one of the tables off to the side,

786
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.036
you see a singular beautiful ruby

787
00:30:16.036 --> 00:30:17.594
about the size of your palm.

788
00:30:17.594 --> 00:30:20.306
Not you guys' palm, but your palm.

789
00:30:20.306 --> 00:30:21.981
It's polished into the smooth sphere

790
00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:23.510
with a little bit of golden filigree

791
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.997
that appears to be embedded around the top and bottom of it.

792
00:30:25.997 --> 00:30:27.793
SAM: Okay, I'm going to make a few trips back and forth

793
00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:29.841
with the Mage Hand to get all this stuff.

794
00:30:29.841 --> 00:30:31.597
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Get that ruby.

795
00:30:31.597 --> 00:30:32.567
MATT: Okay.

796
00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:34.351
MARISHA: While he's doing that, I just fixate

797
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:38.660
on the red light, and see if it moves, track it.

798
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.228
I'm on that.

799
00:30:41.228 --> 00:30:43.728
LIAM: How far is Nott from that--

800
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.314
MATT: Within 30 feet.

801
00:30:46.314 --> 00:30:48.932
LIAM: I have walked up behind her and wave my hand

802
00:30:48.932 --> 00:30:51.326
through the air and cast Detect Magic.

803
00:30:51.326 --> 00:30:52.159
MATT: Okay.

804
00:30:53.863 --> 00:30:58.280
Looking through Detect Magic, you can see that there,

805
00:30:59.811 --> 00:31:03.120
a number of the small little elements on the table

806
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.779
and around the tomes and such have a faint

807
00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:07.779
magical essence to them.

808
00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:12.390
The ruby that you see drifting towards Nott

809
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.399
as she plucks it from the shadow

810
00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:16.938
has a fairly strong magical essence to it.

811
00:31:16.938 --> 00:31:18.270
LIAM: The writing on the floor,

812
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:22.205
does it give off a specific school of magic?

813
00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:26.157
MATT: Detect Magic, yes, it would be necromantic.

814
00:31:26.157 --> 00:31:28.441
TRAVIS: Not good.
MATT: Yeah.

815
00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:31.168
(laughter)

816
00:31:31.168 --> 00:31:35.633
TRAVIS: Holy shit, we are just on
that part of the roller coaster.

817
00:31:35.633 --> 00:31:38.837
We're like (high pitched noise) and down.

818
00:31:38.837 --> 00:31:41.646
MATT: As you pluck the ruby from the Mage Hand

819
00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:43.315
and go to place it in your pouch,

820
00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:45.581
a voice suddenly fills your mind that goes,

821
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:47.039
"You!"

822
00:31:48.431 --> 00:31:50.067
What do you do?

823
00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:51.499
LAURA: Just her head?

824
00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:52.949
SAM: Me?
MATT: Just you.

825
00:31:52.949 --> 00:31:54.559
Nobody else heard anything.

826
00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:55.392
SAM: Yes?

827
00:31:56.286 --> 00:31:57.269
TALIESIN: Yes what?

828
00:31:58.461 --> 00:32:02.861
MATT: "I see you have found your way to my situation.

829
00:32:03.962 --> 00:32:05.462
"Do not be alarmed.

830
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.743
"But I think we can help each other, yes?"

831
00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:13.844
SAM: Caleb, are you hearing anything?

832
00:32:13.844 --> 00:32:16.552
LIAM: No, what are you hearing?

833
00:32:16.552 --> 00:32:19.317
SAM: I'll be right back with you.

834
00:32:19.317 --> 00:32:24.102
Yes, I'm sure, can you help us out of here?

835
00:32:24.102 --> 00:32:26.005
MATT: "That is possible.

836
00:32:26.005 --> 00:32:27.171
"That is very possible."

837
00:32:27.171 --> 00:32:28.215
LIAM: Nott, who are you talking to?

838
00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:29.964
Look at me, who are you talking to?

839
00:32:29.964 --> 00:32:31.907
SAM: Who are you?

840
00:32:31.907 --> 00:32:36.907
MATT: "I am Halas Lutigran, the Heusta-mage of Zaidel,

841
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:39.608
"and you are within my private home."

842
00:32:39.608 --> 00:32:44.491
SAM: Halas Charlemagne, or something.

843
00:32:44.491 --> 00:32:46.697
LIAM: What is he saying?

844
00:32:46.697 --> 00:32:48.201
SAM: He gave me his name.

845
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:50.115
I can hear him.

846
00:32:50.115 --> 00:32:51.365
You can't?

847
00:32:52.481 --> 00:32:55.922
He sounds-- are you Zemnian?

848
00:32:58.494 --> 00:33:00.915
MATT: "I am Zaidelian."

849
00:33:00.915 --> 00:33:03.985
SAM: Oh, he's not. He's Zeidelian.

850
00:33:03.985 --> 00:33:05.250
LIAM: Does that mean anything to me?
SAM: He seems nice.

851
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.419
MATT: Zeidel, and actually a lot of the basis

852
00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:12.419
of the Zemnian language and the culture of the Empire itself

853
00:33:12.588 --> 00:33:16.590
stems from what used to be a society known as Zeidel.

854
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.298
LIAM: So that's instant recognition.
MATT: Yeah.

855
00:33:18.298 --> 00:33:19.531
SAM: In real life.

856
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:24.505
LIAM: Yeah, that's sort of Zemnian, sort of older.

857
00:33:25.942 --> 00:33:27.224
SAM: Do you want to talk to Caleb?

858
00:33:27.224 --> 00:33:29.918
He's pretty smart about these things.

859
00:33:29.918 --> 00:33:32.106
MATT: "I, but of course, whatever you would like

860
00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:33.571
"to put in front of me.

861
00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:38.334
"It is imperative that we have a conversation.

862
00:33:38.334 --> 00:33:41.561
"Whoever of you seems to be the most willful

863
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:42.915
"and able to accomplish."

864
00:33:42.915 --> 00:33:44.919
TRAVIS: (worried grunts)

865
00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:46.636
LIAM: What is he saying, what is he saying?

866
00:33:46.636 --> 00:33:50.469
SAM: He wants to know which one of us is willful?

867
00:33:53.116 --> 00:33:56.721
You need to know which one of us is the smartest,

868
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:57.821
is that right?

869
00:33:57.821 --> 00:33:59.367
MARISHA: Is willful?

870
00:33:59.367 --> 00:34:01.985
MATT: "Anyone of you that you would see as a leader

871
00:34:01.985 --> 00:34:06.732
"or person who is able to make decisions."

872
00:34:06.732 --> 00:34:08.821
SAM: He wants to talk to our leader, I think.

873
00:34:08.821 --> 00:34:09.654
TRAVIS: Oh.

874
00:34:09.654 --> 00:34:11.121
LAURA: Would we have noticed any of this stuff happening?

875
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:12.162
LIAM: I grab Nott by the hand and start

876
00:34:12.162 --> 00:34:14.426
slowly pulling back away from this.
MARISHA: Where you going?

877
00:34:14.426 --> 00:34:16.092
Hey, hey, where you going?

878
00:34:16.092 --> 00:34:18.479
SAM: I mean, Caleb's our leader, so--
MARISHA: Hey, secrets don't make friends.

879
00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:19.635
LIAM: I'm not keeping a secret.

880
00:34:19.635 --> 00:34:21.586
Could we maybe back it up a little bit?

881
00:34:21.586 --> 00:34:24.490
Everybody take 20 paces back.

882
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.183
LAURA: Straight back or towards you paces?

883
00:34:27.183 --> 00:34:28.963
LIAM: Back from that.

884
00:34:28.963 --> 00:34:31.744
MARISHA: I'm still looking at the red dot.

885
00:34:31.744 --> 00:34:32.577
MATT: Okay.

886
00:34:33.537 --> 00:34:34.883
It's not moving.

887
00:34:34.883 --> 00:34:36.550
LIAM: Beauregard.
MARISHA: Yeah.

888
00:34:37.706 --> 00:34:42.040
LIAM: That thing is talking to our little friend.

889
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.399
MARISHA: No, that makes total sense.

890
00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:45.022
TALIESIN: Wait, which one?

891
00:34:45.022 --> 00:34:46.189
SAM: Me.

892
00:34:46.189 --> 00:34:47.680
TALIESIN: Who's talking?

893
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.049
SAM: Halas is talking to me.

894
00:34:49.049 --> 00:34:50.514
LAURA: Halas is talking?!

895
00:34:50.514 --> 00:34:51.883
He is not moving at all!

896
00:34:51.883 --> 00:34:53.945
SAM: You know, now I know what it's like for you

897
00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:55.979
to talk to the Traveler. It's like this weird thing,

898
00:34:55.979 --> 00:34:57.905
like there's voices in your head

899
00:34:57.905 --> 00:34:59.196
and it's kind of comforting.

900
00:34:59.196 --> 00:35:00.506
MARISHA: What did you grab?

901
00:35:00.506 --> 00:35:02.263
LAURA: It's not in my head, he is talking to me

902
00:35:02.263 --> 00:35:04.149
on the outside of my head.
SAM: Oh.

903
00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:05.212
MARISHA: Nott.
SAM: Huh?

904
00:35:05.212 --> 00:35:06.620
MARISHA: What did you grab?

905
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.313
SAM: I grabbed a sack of gold, some chalk,

906
00:35:09.313 --> 00:35:12.500
some blackened soot, and this ruby that I'm still holding.

907
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.027
LAURA: Ooh.

908
00:35:14.027 --> 00:35:15.796
LIAM: Just listen to me--
LAURA: It's really shiny.

909
00:35:15.796 --> 00:35:19.238
LIAM: The circle in there is death.

910
00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:20.922
LAURA: Can I see it?
LIAM: Jester!

911
00:35:20.922 --> 00:35:22.790
SAM: I'm holding it with my Mage Hand right now,

912
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:25.120
just in case it, you know, kills us or something.

913
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.970
LAURA: Oh, okay.

914
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.167
MARISHA: Will you hold it up a little bit,

915
00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.693
kind of up into the light?

916
00:35:29.693 --> 00:35:31.076
MATT: So you moved from grabbing it

917
00:35:31.076 --> 00:35:32.633
to moving it with your Mage Hand?

918
00:35:34.408 --> 00:35:36.025
SAM: Oh, maybe I had--

919
00:35:36.025 --> 00:35:37.526
MATT: So the moment you went to retrieve it

920
00:35:37.526 --> 00:35:39.430
from the Mage Hand, so you're holding it in your hand.

921
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.622
SAM: Yes. It's right here.
LAURA: Can I see it?

922
00:35:41.622 --> 00:35:43.205
SAM: Sure, sure, here.

923
00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.198
Is it talking to you now?
LAURA: It's really shiny.

924
00:35:46.198 --> 00:35:48.023
MATT: You look closely into it.
LAURA: Is what talking to me?

925
00:35:48.023 --> 00:35:48.856
LIAM: <i>Jester</i>.

926
00:35:48.856 --> 00:35:50.485
MATT: You look closely into the ruby, and you can see

927
00:35:50.485 --> 00:35:54.100
this swirling mist of gray

928
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.280
that leads to purple to red, and back.

929
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.068
LIAM: Jester! Put it down, <i>now</i>!

930
00:35:58.068 --> 00:36:01.351
MATT: And a faint glimmer of two golden amber eyes

931
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:04.151
that peer back at you, and a voice goes,

932
00:36:04.151 --> 00:36:07.453
"Are you the one who would be considered the leader

933
00:36:07.453 --> 00:36:11.324
"of whatever this incursion might be?"

934
00:36:11.324 --> 00:36:12.518
LAURA: The leader of--

935
00:36:12.518 --> 00:36:13.625
SAM: See, now she's talking to it.

936
00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:14.937
LAURA: --all of the world, you mean?

937
00:36:14.937 --> 00:36:16.220
SAM: Here, I'll snatch it back.

938
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.583
LIAM: Nott the Brave, please put it on the ground.

939
00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:18.858
SAM: Okay.

940
00:36:18.858 --> 00:36:22.251
LIAM: Please do not touch it, anyone.

941
00:36:22.251 --> 00:36:25.155
LAURA: Okay, but it sounded kind of okay.

942
00:36:25.155 --> 00:36:26.338
TRAVIS: What was it asking of you?

943
00:36:26.338 --> 00:36:27.506
LAURA: It asked me if I was the leader,

944
00:36:27.506 --> 00:36:30.488
and I was about to say, you know, yeah, totally.

945
00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.646
TRAVIS: Caleb, what's your hesitation?

946
00:36:31.646 --> 00:36:35.554
LIAM: This, him, has made clones,

947
00:36:35.554 --> 00:36:38.136
other bodies for himself.

948
00:36:38.136 --> 00:36:40.131
He wants to live forever.

949
00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:42.219
He wants to live on.

950
00:36:42.219 --> 00:36:43.988
I don't know what that is, I don't know

951
00:36:43.988 --> 00:36:46.618
what that's plans are.

952
00:36:46.618 --> 00:36:48.868
That is dangerous to touch.

953
00:36:50.238 --> 00:36:52.154
I go and sit by it and pull out my book

954
00:36:52.154 --> 00:36:55.790
and I start to go through the steps of Identify.

955
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:58.145
LAURA: Did it feel like it was like,

956
00:36:58.145 --> 00:37:01.209
drawing us to it when it was talking to us?

957
00:37:01.209 --> 00:37:03.352
Or did it feel just like a dude talking?

958
00:37:03.352 --> 00:37:08.352
MATT: It felt similar to when someone messages you back.

959
00:37:09.108 --> 00:37:10.727
It was just a voice in your mind.

960
00:37:10.727 --> 00:37:11.560
LAURA: Okay.

961
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.914
MARISHA: I have a theory.

962
00:37:12.914 --> 00:37:13.747
SAM: What is it?

963
00:37:13.747 --> 00:37:15.451
MARISHA: Is the ruby thing glowing?

964
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:16.436
Is it glowing a little?

965
00:37:16.436 --> 00:37:17.675
LAURA: It has eyes, Beau.

966
00:37:17.675 --> 00:37:19.044
MATT: From where it's sitting there,
it just looks like a ruby,

967
00:37:19.044 --> 00:37:20.167
just a stone.

968
00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:22.140
LAURA: There were eyeballs looking out at me.

969
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:22.973
TRAVIS: Wow.

970
00:37:22.973 --> 00:37:23.868
SAM: Oh, you saw eyeballs?

971
00:37:23.868 --> 00:37:25.372
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw two glowing

972
00:37:25.372 --> 00:37:27.819
ember-looking eyeballs looking at me.

973
00:37:27.819 --> 00:37:28.884
MARISHA: I'm going to walk over--

974
00:37:28.884 --> 00:37:29.908
TRAVIS: Do you think he's trapped in there?

975
00:37:29.908 --> 00:37:32.277
SAM: Do you want to try, Beau?

976
00:37:32.277 --> 00:37:33.510
MARISHA: Wanna talk to him?

977
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.067
LAURA: Maybe his little soul got trapped in there

978
00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:37.328
and it's not in his body anymore.

979
00:37:37.328 --> 00:37:38.886
TRAVIS: What if his soul jumps out of the stone

980
00:37:38.886 --> 00:37:40.413
into whoever's touching it?

981
00:37:40.413 --> 00:37:42.900
LIAM: Yeah, can I have nine more minutes, please?

982
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.649
And I'm not looking into it directly,

983
00:37:44.649 --> 00:37:47.316
I'm looking at it in peripheral.

984
00:37:47.316 --> 00:37:49.085
TRAVIS: It seems like we're, hello?

985
00:37:49.085 --> 00:37:51.250
Can I yell and see if there's an echo?

986
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.083
MATT: Yep.

987
00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:54.922
Hello, hello, hello. It echoes.

988
00:37:54.922 --> 00:37:57.295
TRAVIS: Anybody see a wall?
MARISHA: Fjord, come here with me real quick.

989
00:37:57.295 --> 00:38:00.060
I want to walk over to under the red light,

990
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.192
I want to get closer to it.

991
00:38:01.192 --> 00:38:02.231
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that red light there.

992
00:38:02.231 --> 00:38:04.329
MARISHA: Yeah, you see it?
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally, yeah.

993
00:38:04.329 --> 00:38:07.053
MARISHA: Do I see any others?
MATT: Make a perception check.

994
00:38:07.053 --> 00:38:11.432
MARISHA: Around the room like it, not necessarily there.

995
00:38:11.432 --> 00:38:12.520
LAURA: He doesn't see it.

996
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.916
TALIESIN: There are no lights!

997
00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:15.085
MARISHA: 14.

998
00:38:15.085 --> 00:38:15.918
MATT: 14.

999
00:38:17.463 --> 00:38:19.449
You focus and move a little bit,

1000
00:38:19.449 --> 00:38:20.980
and you focus and move a little bit.

1001
00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.015
Once you step out from directly underneath it,

1002
00:38:23.015 --> 00:38:25.926
it's hard to find it once more on the ceiling,

1003
00:38:25.926 --> 00:38:27.496
and only because you've already seen it once,

1004
00:38:27.496 --> 00:38:29.914
you can just barely see that faint bit of that hue.

1005
00:38:29.914 --> 00:38:32.667
Once again, the shape, the source, is too far

1006
00:38:32.667 --> 00:38:36.260
and too lost in mostly shadow for you to make it out,

1007
00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.456
but no other sources.

1008
00:38:37.456 --> 00:38:38.918
TRAVIS: Only because this place is like a nightmare,

1009
00:38:38.918 --> 00:38:40.886
I just want to see if we can find a boundary,

1010
00:38:40.886 --> 00:38:43.220
and I'll send an Eldritch Blast in one direction.

1011
00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.553
MATT: All right.

1012
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:49.046
You see the dull green light before it fizzles out.

1013
00:38:49.046 --> 00:38:52.086
It reaches the extent of its distance before vanishing.

1014
00:38:52.086 --> 00:38:54.129
TRAVIS: Nothing for at least 120 feet.

1015
00:38:54.129 --> 00:38:58.602
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's try and not cast as much as possible.

1016
00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:03.291
MARISHA: Because these pillars, they
get fatter up at the top,

1017
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:05.157
like there's an archway or something.

1018
00:39:05.157 --> 00:39:07.067
It feels like it's got to have a ceiling.

1019
00:39:07.067 --> 00:39:08.394
TALIESIN: I got an idea.

1020
00:39:08.394 --> 00:39:09.227
MARISHA: Yeah?

1021
00:39:09.227 --> 00:39:11.274
TALIESIN: You have a ball bearing?

1022
00:39:11.274 --> 00:39:12.274
MARISHA: Oh.

1023
00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:14.299
Oh yeah.

1024
00:39:14.299 --> 00:39:15.472
TALIESIN: All right, here, give me a ball bearing.

1025
00:39:15.472 --> 00:39:17.389
MARISHA: I hand him my bag of balls.

1026
00:39:17.389 --> 00:39:19.225
TALIESIN: I cast Light on a single ball bearing.

1027
00:39:19.225 --> 00:39:20.598
And I toss it up in the air.
LIAM: First one's free.

1028
00:39:20.598 --> 00:39:22.702
MATT: Roll a strength check.

1029
00:39:22.702 --> 00:39:24.001
TALIESIN: This'll be funny.

1030
00:39:24.001 --> 00:39:24.834
Hey!

1031
00:39:25.782 --> 00:39:26.731
18.

1032
00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:28.460
MATT: 18! Okay.

1033
00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.417
(whooshes)

1034
00:39:29.417 --> 00:39:32.052
You watch as it goes up, and as the light arcs up,

1035
00:39:32.052 --> 00:39:34.669
you watch as the pillars turn into a rough archway,

1036
00:39:34.669 --> 00:39:36.452
and then you see a roof.

1037
00:39:36.452 --> 00:39:39.537
Similar texture as the floor beneath you.

1038
00:39:39.537 --> 00:39:41.866
TALIESIN: Did it get anywhere near the red dot, or no?

1039
00:39:41.866 --> 00:39:43.351
MATT: You're throwing it up there.

1040
00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:45.021
Do you want to try and throw again at the red dot?

1041
00:39:45.021 --> 00:39:46.213
LAURA: (babbling) I wanna try.

1042
00:39:46.213 --> 00:39:47.997
MARISHA: I catch it as it comes back down.

1043
00:39:47.997 --> 00:39:49.910
TALIESIN: That's still lit, so it's all yours.

1044
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.644
LAURA: Toss it up, toss it up.

1045
00:39:52.644 --> 00:39:55.405
MATT: Okay, roll a dexterity check now,
since you're aiming it.

1046
00:39:55.405 --> 00:39:58.122
TRAVIS: Roughly how high is this--?

1047
00:39:58.977 --> 00:40:00.274
MARISHA: Just a straight dex check?
MATT: Yep.

1048
00:40:00.274 --> 00:40:02.540
MARISHA: 15.
MATT: That's fine.

1049
00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.548
It goes up, and as it reaches the portion

1050
00:40:04.548 --> 00:40:07.439
where that red glow was, you can see now

1051
00:40:07.439 --> 00:40:10.293
the ceiling there has

1052
00:40:10.293 --> 00:40:14.682
about a 10-foot diameter glyph

1053
00:40:14.682 --> 00:40:17.782
or series of symbols in a circular pattern

1054
00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:19.962
that is giving off this reddish glow.

1055
00:40:19.962 --> 00:40:23.061
SAM: Are those directly above the glyphs on the ground?

1056
00:40:23.061 --> 00:40:24.969
MATT: It would be, yes.

1057
00:40:24.969 --> 00:40:28.559
SAM: Is the table in that glyph area, or just--

1058
00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:31.523
MATT: The tables and books and everything are around it.

1059
00:40:31.523 --> 00:40:33.839
There's just like a rough bit of materials

1060
00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:35.391
from this laboratory, and--

1061
00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:37.600
TRAVIS: But his body is definitely in like the circle

1062
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.970
underneath those glyphs.

1063
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.108
MATT: It's in it, but it's not perfectly in the center,

1064
00:40:41.108 --> 00:40:42.944
it's in it and off.

1065
00:40:42.944 --> 00:40:46.424
Like, looking at it like it may have fallen.

1066
00:40:46.424 --> 00:40:48.321
TRAVIS: Over.
LAURA: The body fell.

1067
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:49.210
Oh, weird.

1068
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.120
MARISHA: So-- and I can see more of these red runes.

1069
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.171
LAURA: He was experimenting and he
accidentally trapped his stuff.

1070
00:40:54.171 --> 00:40:55.682
SAM: He was stabbed to death with an icicle--

1071
00:40:55.682 --> 00:40:57.224
MARISHA: Are the runes all around it?

1072
00:40:57.224 --> 00:41:00.265
MATT: You do a few more tosses, nope, just that one.

1073
00:41:00.265 --> 00:41:02.699
MARISHA: Just that one. There's a red ring there.

1074
00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:03.690
A circle.

1075
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.932
TRAVIS: We don't have any pieces of the heart, right?
It all turned to like goo and shit?

1076
00:41:06.932 --> 00:41:09.257
LAURA: Nott and I look at the books on the table.
SAM: We're going to check out the table.

1077
00:41:09.257 --> 00:41:11.790
MATT: Okay. You open the books.

1078
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:15.161
All of them are in a language you don't understand.

1079
00:41:15.161 --> 00:41:16.574
SAM: Okay, okay.

1080
00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.575
MATT: So neither of you know Zemnian, correct?

1081
00:41:18.575 --> 00:41:19.756
SAM: I've picked up a few words.

1082
00:41:19.756 --> 00:41:21.167
MATT: A few words, you recognize it as Zemnian.

1083
00:41:21.167 --> 00:41:22.567
SAM: Okay.

1084
00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:25.022
MATT: But there are all manner of--

1085
00:41:25.022 --> 00:41:27.547
you do recognize certain arcane signatures

1086
00:41:27.547 --> 00:41:29.975
and glyphs and symbols from spellcraft

1087
00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:32.509
from what you've seen in Caleb's book.

1088
00:41:32.509 --> 00:41:37.143
There's some sort of a spellbook

1089
00:41:37.143 --> 00:41:39.297
or something that contains a lot of spell notes.

1090
00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:41.246
Other things that are research elements

1091
00:41:41.246 --> 00:41:43.850
that have a lot of sketches.

1092
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:46.031
You can see small devices, you can see one page

1093
00:41:46.031 --> 00:41:48.884
that has a sketch that looks just like the ruby you found.

1094
00:41:48.884 --> 00:41:49.870
LAURA: (gasps)

1095
00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.441
Oh my god, I draw--
SAM: How many books are there?

1096
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:53.353
MATT: Four.
LAURA: I draw a dick on the ruby.

1097
00:41:53.353 --> 00:41:54.975
(laughter)

1098
00:41:54.975 --> 00:41:56.224
SAM: You said four?
MATT: Yes.

1099
00:41:56.224 --> 00:41:59.088
Jester wrestles it from you and hastily sketches

1100
00:41:59.088 --> 00:42:02.112
a tiny penis across the ruby drawing.

1101
00:42:02.112 --> 00:42:03.852
LAURA: Now it's a happy ruby.

1102
00:42:03.852 --> 00:42:05.549
SAM: I will take the four books--

1103
00:42:05.549 --> 00:42:07.137
LIAM: Now it's a rupee.

1104
00:42:07.137 --> 00:42:08.920
SAM: --and run back to Caleb.

1105
00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.374
Lebby, Lebby!

1106
00:42:11.307 --> 00:42:12.637
That's my new nickname for you.

1107
00:42:12.637 --> 00:42:13.571
Lebby!

1108
00:42:13.571 --> 00:42:14.694
(laughter)

1109
00:42:14.694 --> 00:42:16.506
Lebby, I'm trying it out, see if it sticks.

1110
00:42:16.506 --> 00:42:18.355
TRAVIS: Let him finish.

1111
00:42:18.355 --> 00:42:19.374
SAM: How many more minutes you got?

1112
00:42:19.374 --> 00:42:20.816
Because these are amazing.

1113
00:42:20.816 --> 00:42:23.060
LIAM: Just a minute, please, please, please.

1114
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.010
SAM: Okay, one minute.

1115
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.593
MATT: All right, you cast Identify.

1116
00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:31.737
This is a ruby,

1117
00:42:32.904 --> 00:42:36.405
but it is designed as a reliquary.

1118
00:42:36.405 --> 00:42:40.354
Meant to be, you know, either something that is used

1119
00:42:40.354 --> 00:42:43.613
for a focus of worship or a focus of ritual,

1120
00:42:43.613 --> 00:42:48.613
or a focus of any sort of other attentive

1121
00:42:48.779 --> 00:42:50.970
focal point that is required.

1122
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:55.872
It is very beautifully made, it looks like it's been--

1123
00:42:55.872 --> 00:42:57.881
aside from the spill it took on the ground,

1124
00:42:57.881 --> 00:43:01.817
maybe being dropped or tossed away from the body--

1125
00:43:01.817 --> 00:43:02.816
looks impeccable.

1126
00:43:02.816 --> 00:43:04.193
LIAM: Yeah, I throw a rag over it.

1127
00:43:04.193 --> 00:43:05.351
MATT: Okay.

1128
00:43:06.315 --> 00:43:09.223
TRAVIS: Do you one of you clerics have the ability to judge

1129
00:43:09.223 --> 00:43:12.178
like the normal health of a body that's eyes open

1130
00:43:12.178 --> 00:43:15.092
and breathing but not responding?
LAURA: I can do a medicine check on him.

1131
00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:16.551
I mean, I can check his health.
TALIESIN: I'll help with that.

1132
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:18.694
TRAVIS: Can you see if he was diseased or--

1133
00:43:18.694 --> 00:43:20.538
SAM: You probably have to get right up next to him.

1134
00:43:20.538 --> 00:43:21.798
TRAVIS: --poisoned over time.

1135
00:43:21.798 --> 00:43:23.540
LAURA: I'll stay outside of the sigils,

1136
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.092
but I'll just get a look at his body.

1137
00:43:26.092 --> 00:43:27.504
If I can.
MATT: Okay.

1138
00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:28.532
Go ahead and make a medicine check.

1139
00:43:28.532 --> 00:43:29.782
TALIESIN: With-- I'll assist.

1140
00:43:29.782 --> 00:43:30.615
MATT: All right.

1141
00:43:30.615 --> 00:43:32.195
The two of you--
LAURA: Guide me.

1142
00:43:32.195 --> 00:43:33.612
TALIESIN: Guidance.

1143
00:43:35.336 --> 00:43:36.169
Hmm.

1144
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:38.599
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1145
00:43:38.599 --> 00:43:40.147
SAM: Maybe we should just throw something in there

1146
00:43:40.147 --> 00:43:42.328
and see if it, you know, catches on fire or something.

1147
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:43.700
LAURA: Nice.
TALIESIN: Nice.

1148
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.756
LAURA: 23.

1149
00:43:44.756 --> 00:43:45.825
MATT: 23.

1150
00:43:45.825 --> 00:43:47.581
Body appears to be healthy.

1151
00:43:47.581 --> 00:43:48.952
LAURA: He seems healthy.

1152
00:43:48.952 --> 00:43:51.420
SAM: Why don't we go-- can we send in Willi

1153
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.288
to drag the body out of the sigil area so we can look at it?

1154
00:43:54.288 --> 00:43:56.236
TRAVIS: I don't think that's a good idea.

1155
00:43:56.236 --> 00:43:58.552
SAM: I mean, it's Willi, it's not us.

1156
00:43:58.552 --> 00:43:59.993
LIAM: He's still standing back where we--

1157
00:43:59.993 --> 00:44:02.022
TRAVIS: Yeah, what if he leaves that circle

1158
00:44:02.022 --> 00:44:03.932
and all of a sudden is like, awake?

1159
00:44:03.932 --> 00:44:05.724
TALIESIN: What if breaking that sigil sets something off?

1160
00:44:05.724 --> 00:44:08.072
What if the body changes while it's out there?

1161
00:44:08.072 --> 00:44:10.085
What if it kills him, what if it doesn't?

1162
00:44:10.085 --> 00:44:11.554
LIAM: There is a--

1163
00:44:11.554 --> 00:44:12.952
SAM: So many pessimists in this room.

1164
00:44:12.952 --> 00:44:16.360
LIAM: --fairly decent chance that this

1165
00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.646
on the ground is the jar.

1166
00:44:19.646 --> 00:44:21.479
SAM: Is the <i>jah</i>? What's a <i>jah</i>?

1167
00:44:21.479 --> 00:44:22.512
TALIESIN: The jar?

1168
00:44:22.512 --> 00:44:23.940
LAURA: Oh, the jar.

1169
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.639
Not like the actual jars, but like a ruby,

1170
00:44:26.639 --> 00:44:28.270
like it's a symbolic jar.

1171
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.918
SAM: A jar of what?

1172
00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:31.526
LIAM: Of Halas.

1173
00:44:31.526 --> 00:44:32.632
MARISHA: Ew.

1174
00:44:32.632 --> 00:44:35.442
SAM: Ew, gross.
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1175
00:44:35.442 --> 00:44:39.609
LIAM: So this has two eyes in it,

1176
00:44:39.609 --> 00:44:42.166
this is maybe talking to us,

1177
00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:44.480
please nobody touch this.

1178
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.786
LAURA: Well what if he's been in here for a long time?

1179
00:44:46.786 --> 00:44:49.594
But can I just touch it and see
if he's been in there for a long time?

1180
00:44:49.594 --> 00:44:51.502
LIAM: I would really prefer that you do not.

1181
00:44:51.502 --> 00:44:54.202
LAURA: Just one little pinky touch?

1182
00:44:54.202 --> 00:44:57.465
What if he's suffering in a little ruby prison?

1183
00:44:58.648 --> 00:45:02.816
LIAM: I don't want <i>you</i> suffering in a little ruby prison.

1184
00:45:02.816 --> 00:45:04.120
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

1185
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.636
But currently we have no way out of here.

1186
00:45:06.636 --> 00:45:08.504
We see a red light above us--

1187
00:45:08.504 --> 00:45:12.278
TALIESIN: We have sudden access to
the best amount of information

1188
00:45:12.278 --> 00:45:13.719
about this place we could hope for.

1189
00:45:13.719 --> 00:45:16.697
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, maybe we do, but maybe
the first thing we do is not touch it.

1190
00:45:16.697 --> 00:45:19.096
MARISHA: You said that the runes line up

1191
00:45:19.096 --> 00:45:20.716
with the runes underneath?

1192
00:45:20.716 --> 00:45:23.128
MATT: The appear to be directly above, yes.

1193
00:45:23.128 --> 00:45:26.381
MARISHA: You said that it looked like the ruby thing

1194
00:45:26.381 --> 00:45:29.397
was like, tossed to the side.

1195
00:45:29.397 --> 00:45:30.768
TRAVIS: Or maybe he dropped it or threw it.

1196
00:45:30.768 --> 00:45:32.525
MATT: It had been dropped or it tumbled away

1197
00:45:32.525 --> 00:45:35.251
where it would have been found
beneath one of the tables in shadow.

1198
00:45:35.251 --> 00:45:37.242
LAURA: He accidentally put his soul in this ruby

1199
00:45:37.242 --> 00:45:39.749
and then he fell over and the ruby fell away from him.

1200
00:45:39.749 --> 00:45:41.698
TRAVIS: He did step one, he didn't know what step two was.

1201
00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:43.412
Let the wizard read the Zemnian books.

1202
00:45:43.412 --> 00:45:46.577
LIAM: I'm going to scoop down Frumpkin and place him

1203
00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:50.200
in front of this gem, tell him to meow

1204
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.043
if anything problematic happens.

1205
00:45:52.043 --> 00:45:53.187
TRAVIS: (fake sneezes)

1206
00:45:53.187 --> 00:45:55.845
And then I will go over to the books
and start perusing them.

1207
00:45:55.845 --> 00:45:57.878
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Here, I brought them to you.

1208
00:45:57.878 --> 00:45:59.058
LIAM: Oh, you brought them over, okay.

1209
00:45:59.058 --> 00:46:00.918
I move 10 feet away from the ruby

1210
00:46:00.918 --> 00:46:02.268
and start looking through them.

1211
00:46:02.268 --> 00:46:05.176
SAM: They're spellbooks, Lebby, they're spellbooks.

1212
00:46:05.176 --> 00:46:06.626
It's going to stick.

1213
00:46:06.626 --> 00:46:08.436
TRAVIS: Terrible.

1214
00:46:08.436 --> 00:46:11.438
SAM: And look, there's all sorts of stuff.
LIAM: Little bit like "labia."

1215
00:46:11.438 --> 00:46:15.209
Maybe there's some new spells that you could learn.

1216
00:46:15.209 --> 00:46:18.066
MARISHA: Kind of like it more now.
LAURA: I know, right? It is kind of better.

1217
00:46:18.066 --> 00:46:19.337
(laughter)

1218
00:46:19.337 --> 00:46:21.270
MARISHA: Can we just call you Labia?
LIAM: What are the books?

1219
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.228
MATT: All right, so...

1220
00:46:24.228 --> 00:46:26.419
go ahead and just roll an investigation check for me,

1221
00:46:26.419 --> 00:46:29.219
standard investigation check.
LIAM: So good at rolling these days.

1222
00:46:30.142 --> 00:46:31.232
That's better, 22.

1223
00:46:31.232 --> 00:46:32.065
MATT: 22.

1224
00:46:34.264 --> 00:46:36.445
A number of the books are ancient ritual tomes

1225
00:46:36.445 --> 00:46:39.599
and spells dealing with manipulation of the soul.

1226
00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:40.655
Kind of in line with some of the previous notes

1227
00:46:40.655 --> 00:46:43.237
you've seen as research in the Permaheart study.

1228
00:46:43.237 --> 00:46:45.634
Including the elaborate magical equations

1229
00:46:45.634 --> 00:46:47.856
for some powerful spells.

1230
00:46:47.856 --> 00:46:50.505
One of them is a partial notebook and a partial spellbook,

1231
00:46:50.505 --> 00:46:53.670
and within it are the spells Magic Jar,

1232
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.235
Trap the Soul, and Clone.

1233
00:46:56.235 --> 00:46:59.676
TRAVIS: Holy fucking shit.
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

1234
00:46:59.676 --> 00:47:01.817
What does it say?

1235
00:47:01.817 --> 00:47:04.757
MATT: Among them are numerous scraps of various spells

1236
00:47:04.757 --> 00:47:06.619
in mid-design.

1237
00:47:06.619 --> 00:47:07.794
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god.

1238
00:47:07.794 --> 00:47:11.690
MATT: Partially constructed, unfinished magical equations,

1239
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.368
mostly escaping your understanding in their broken

1240
00:47:14.368 --> 00:47:16.258
half-formed state.

1241
00:47:16.258 --> 00:47:19.121
However, because you rolled a high enough investigation,

1242
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:21.460
one of them catches your attention.

1243
00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.524
One of the partially developed spells

1244
00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:25.390
is tied to Halas' work seeking to alter

1245
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.925
his own body permanently instead of relying

1246
00:47:27.925 --> 00:47:30.069
on the failing clones.

1247
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:31.650
This looks to be one of the last things

1248
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.829
he was working on before he fell into

1249
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:36.775
the state you see him in now.

1250
00:47:36.775 --> 00:47:37.984
SAM: Do you tell us all this?

1251
00:47:37.984 --> 00:47:40.795
MATT: The transmutative theories and
advanced arcane mechanics

1252
00:47:40.795 --> 00:47:43.611
within this partially-designed spell are incredible,

1253
00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:45.950
and connect some dots about reforming a living body

1254
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:49.349
to become a different type of similar body indefinitely.

1255
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:52.245
LAURA: (pensive murmuring)

1256
00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:53.494
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1257
00:47:53.494 --> 00:47:55.730
TRAVIS: (imitating sirens)

1258
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.980
MARISHA: (laughs)

1259
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:02.191
SAM: Do you tell us this?

1260
00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:05.008
LIAM: I-I-I... he is, uh...

1261
00:48:07.641 --> 00:48:11.154
He is tinkering with some crazy things here.

1262
00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:16.154
He's trying to alter himself, make him other than himself.

1263
00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.039
SAM: Sounds interesting.
MARISHA: I mean, we kind of knew that though.

1264
00:48:19.039 --> 00:48:22.701
LAURA: It also sounds like something a lot of us
have actually done, like what do you mean--

1265
00:48:22.701 --> 00:48:24.694
MARISHA: Yeah, like Disguise Self.
SAM: Permanently?

1266
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:28.036
LIAM: No no no no no no no, more, more. Locking it in.

1267
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.112
Not tricks.

1268
00:48:31.112 --> 00:48:32.112
Transformation.

1269
00:48:33.137 --> 00:48:34.030
Total.

1270
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.879
LAURA: Like true, like Polymorph?

1271
00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:37.296
SAM: Did he succeed?

1272
00:48:38.144 --> 00:48:39.692
LIAM: It's not finished.

1273
00:48:39.692 --> 00:48:41.859
MARISHA: Well what's with the ruby, then?

1274
00:48:41.859 --> 00:48:43.410
TALIESIN: Yeah, what is the ruby?

1275
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.564
SAM: Fuck the ruby, how close is he in that spell?

1276
00:48:45.564 --> 00:48:47.260
LIAM: Where is the book? You said there was a--

1277
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.278
SAM: That spell, that spell, how close is it to being done?

1278
00:48:49.278 --> 00:48:51.103
LIAM: I don't-- I need time with it, Nott.

1279
00:48:51.103 --> 00:48:52.626
MATT: As you glance through the spells that you found

1280
00:48:52.626 --> 00:48:54.847
within the books, the Magic Jar spell

1281
00:48:54.847 --> 00:48:58.097
specifically asks for some sort of a focus or device.

1282
00:48:58.097 --> 00:49:02.750
As you read through the incantation itself,

1283
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.141
it enables individuals who...

1284
00:49:06.141 --> 00:49:08.493
touch-- and confirm specifically here,

1285
00:49:08.493 --> 00:49:11.977
but to "touch and/or within a certain distance

1286
00:49:11.977 --> 00:49:13.705
"of the gem."

1287
00:49:13.705 --> 00:49:14.595
MARISHA: Ooh.

1288
00:49:14.595 --> 00:49:16.048
LAURA: Distance.
MARISHA: Distance?

1289
00:49:16.048 --> 00:49:17.350
MATT: I'm going to double-check this,

1290
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.480
because I'm working from memory here.

1291
00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.430
I don't want the internet to yell at me
for getting it wrong.

1292
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.164
LIAM: (high voice) You were 10 feet off!

1293
00:49:24.164 --> 00:49:25.147
MATT: I know.

1294
00:49:25.147 --> 00:49:26.814
That's how it works.
SAM: That's how the internet sounds.

1295
00:49:27.836 --> 00:49:29.044
(as Mickey Mouse) Hi!

1296
00:49:29.044 --> 00:49:30.414
(laughter)

1297
00:49:30.414 --> 00:49:31.860
TRAVIS: It's Mickey Mouse?

1298
00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.597
MATT: Yeah, it allows the spirit of whatever figure

1299
00:49:35.597 --> 00:49:39.577
has transferred itself into this focus, this reliquary,

1300
00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:42.929
to possess another person within 100 feet of it.

1301
00:49:42.929 --> 00:49:44.944
LIAM: (as Mickey Mouse) Ah! Everybody
get away from this thing!

1302
00:49:44.944 --> 00:49:46.076
(laughter)

1303
00:49:46.076 --> 00:49:47.779
SAM: (as Mickey) Oh boy!
LAURA: How far, what do you mean?

1304
00:49:47.779 --> 00:49:49.626
LIAM: I pick up the book and say move away,

1305
00:49:49.626 --> 00:49:50.862
even further away from that rag.

1306
00:49:50.862 --> 00:49:51.695
LAURA: How far away?

1307
00:49:51.695 --> 00:49:53.493
LIAM: Very far, into the dark, move.

1308
00:49:53.493 --> 00:49:54.659
MATT: All right.

1309
00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:56.828
You all back out, if you're following Caleb's instructions.

1310
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:57.837
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1311
00:49:57.837 --> 00:49:59.820
MATT: So you back out into the shadow.

1312
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.618
Aside from the lights that you currently carry

1313
00:50:02.618 --> 00:50:07.207
to keep the vicinity itself somewhat visible,

1314
00:50:07.207 --> 00:50:09.212
you take a few breaths at a distance.

1315
00:50:09.212 --> 00:50:10.816
LAURA: Why did we back away?

1316
00:50:10.816 --> 00:50:12.709
LIAM: Like a disgruntled librarian holding books

1317
00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:15.809
and one hand is on fire, because that...

1318
00:50:15.809 --> 00:50:17.592
<i>gem</i>--

1319
00:50:17.592 --> 00:50:19.683
if you are close to it, he could...

1320
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.358
overtake you.

1321
00:50:22.358 --> 00:50:24.370
TALIESIN: How long does that-- well, why is he not--

1322
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:27.116
TRAVIS: Close to it, we don't even have to touch it?

1323
00:50:27.116 --> 00:50:29.440
TALIESIN: Weird question, then why hasn't he

1324
00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.866
jumped back into his own body yet?

1325
00:50:31.866 --> 00:50:33.526
SAM: Why didn't he possess us, then?

1326
00:50:33.526 --> 00:50:34.502
LIAM: I don't know.

1327
00:50:34.502 --> 00:50:36.037
LAURA: Maybe he did possess one of us.

1328
00:50:36.037 --> 00:50:39.601
Maybe one of us is secretly Halas now.

1329
00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:42.908
SAM: Quick, ask me a question that only I
would know the answer to.

1330
00:50:42.908 --> 00:50:45.461
LAURA: What does Caleb smell like when he hasn't bathed--

1331
00:50:45.461 --> 00:50:47.150
SAM: ♪ He's stinky ♪

1332
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.573
LAURA: Specifically though, like what's the smell?

1333
00:50:49.573 --> 00:50:54.573
SAM: Eggs, a little bit of like, sort of like...

1334
00:50:54.797 --> 00:50:56.760
Like taint smell, you know?

1335
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.230
(laughter)

1336
00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:00.671
MATT: Another element of the spell as well,

1337
00:51:00.671 --> 00:51:03.903
it wasn't pertinent initially as you were going through,

1338
00:51:03.903 --> 00:51:05.541
but it is in hindsight.

1339
00:51:05.541 --> 00:51:09.678
The individual would be able to place their soul

1340
00:51:09.678 --> 00:51:12.772
back into their body, as long as it's also within 100 feet.

1341
00:51:12.772 --> 00:51:13.980
SAM: Say that again?

1342
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.232
LIAM: He could jump back to his own body.

1343
00:51:16.232 --> 00:51:17.658
TALIESIN: But hasn't.
LAURA: He hasn't.

1344
00:51:17.658 --> 00:51:19.745
MARISHA: He kept asking which one of us was the leader.

1345
00:51:19.745 --> 00:51:22.720
Maybe he was trying to size out who was the most powerful.

1346
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.647
LIAM: That is what he was trying to do.

1347
00:51:24.647 --> 00:51:26.463
TRAVIS: Is something inherently wrong with his body, though?

1348
00:51:26.463 --> 00:51:28.191
Something he doesn't like.

1349
00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:31.091
MARISHA: Maybe it's a bad clone. Maybe--
LAURA: Maybe he's aging.

1350
00:51:31.091 --> 00:51:34.064
TRAVIS: Maybe he can't leave because it's him.

1351
00:51:34.064 --> 00:51:35.982
LAURA: Maybe...

1352
00:51:35.982 --> 00:51:39.190
LIAM: I pull out a bit of-- lose the flame,

1353
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:41.770
pull out some cat mint, and a spectral Frumpkin

1354
00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.990
appears in the air and a giant claw,

1355
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.434
and it rushes out to the body in the center

1356
00:51:46.434 --> 00:51:50.951
and grabs it by the foot and drags it away from that gem.

1357
00:51:50.951 --> 00:51:55.772
MATT: You watch as the large mitt of this spectral,

1358
00:51:55.772 --> 00:52:00.772
exaggerated cat claw grab and ragdoll this body of Halas

1359
00:52:01.157 --> 00:52:02.998
in the opposite direction of where you are

1360
00:52:02.998 --> 00:52:05.906
until it disappears into shadow beyond your visual range.

1361
00:52:05.906 --> 00:52:07.211
TRAVIS: All right.

1362
00:52:07.211 --> 00:52:11.272
I'm assuming you just removed an option for him? It?

1363
00:52:11.272 --> 00:52:12.187
Smart.

1364
00:52:12.187 --> 00:52:14.406
SAM: If he'd wanted that option,
though, he would've taken it.

1365
00:52:14.406 --> 00:52:16.480
LAURA: Yeah, it was only a few feet away from him.

1366
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.744
TRAVIS: True, but better to be safe.

1367
00:52:18.744 --> 00:52:22.027
LIAM: Maybe he has sort of a mode of...

1368
00:52:23.011 --> 00:52:25.186
meditation or rest.

1369
00:52:26.058 --> 00:52:27.341
TRAVIS: All right.

1370
00:52:27.341 --> 00:52:29.578
LAURA: The sigil-- we're too far away,
we can't see the sigil.

1371
00:52:29.578 --> 00:52:32.101
TRAVIS: The other thing we haven't
looked at are those glyphs.

1372
00:52:32.101 --> 00:52:34.556
One of you can go up there, right?

1373
00:52:34.556 --> 00:52:36.108
Can't you just run up a column?

1374
00:52:36.108 --> 00:52:37.326
MARISHA: Yeah.

1375
00:52:37.326 --> 00:52:39.053
TRAVIS: But that puts you closer to the gem.

1376
00:52:39.053 --> 00:52:40.152
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1377
00:52:40.152 --> 00:52:43.607
MARISHA: Well, you still have that cat claw thing, right?

1378
00:52:43.607 --> 00:52:44.925
Can you get the gem further away?

1379
00:52:44.925 --> 00:52:47.692
LIAM: I have about 20 seconds left, do you want me to--

1380
00:52:47.692 --> 00:52:50.012
LAURA: You have Mage Hand, go do it.
SAM: 20 seconds?

1381
00:52:50.012 --> 00:52:52.397
LIAM: It lasts a minute, I mean,
we didn't really say how long.

1382
00:52:52.397 --> 00:52:55.115
TRAVIS: Yeah, drag it off in another direction.
MARISHA: Yeah, just get it a little bit further.

1383
00:52:55.115 --> 00:52:58.228
LIAM: Make the claw come out from
the darkness towards the gem,

1384
00:52:58.228 --> 00:53:00.706
and I will take it in a different direction, 90 degrees.

1385
00:53:00.706 --> 00:53:02.040
LAURA: Make sure you remember where you left it.

1386
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.370
LIAM: Yeah, he is straight out and the gem is going

1387
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.098
to my direct right.

1388
00:53:06.098 --> 00:53:09.047
SAM: He's good at remembering stupid things like that.

1389
00:53:09.047 --> 00:53:11.620
MATT: (chuckling)
LIAM: That is correct.

1390
00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:16.315
MARISHA: Can I-- is there a pillar
nearby that looks scalable?

1391
00:53:16.315 --> 00:53:19.292
Like I could do some dope monk shit up it?

1392
00:53:19.292 --> 00:53:21.050
MATT: You can certainly try.
TRAVIS: Yes!

1393
00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:22.980
MATT: The pillars themselves are mostly smooth.

1394
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.176
They look like, similar to the floor

1395
00:53:26.176 --> 00:53:31.176
and the ceiling around here, hewn to be somewhat straight,

1396
00:53:31.362 --> 00:53:34.132
though they themselves are somewhat rough on the surface,

1397
00:53:34.132 --> 00:53:37.763
so there aren't outcroppings, there aren't platforms,

1398
00:53:37.763 --> 00:53:40.755
there aren't things on it that you could hold onto.

1399
00:53:40.755 --> 00:53:43.266
You would have to either have to physically shimmy up

1400
00:53:43.266 --> 00:53:46.804
like a palm tree, or be creative elsewhere,

1401
00:53:46.804 --> 00:53:48.628
because it is a challenge to get up there.

1402
00:53:48.628 --> 00:53:50.065
LAURA: You can have some fabric.

1403
00:53:50.065 --> 00:53:54.072
MARISHA: I was going to say, I'm going to untie my belt

1404
00:53:54.072 --> 00:53:58.310
from around my belt, my Cobalt Soul belt,

1405
00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.408
and throw it around the pole to give me--

1406
00:54:01.408 --> 00:54:02.463
TRAVIS: Like Mulan.

1407
00:54:02.463 --> 00:54:04.136
MARISHA: Like Mulan!
MATT: Yeah.

1408
00:54:04.136 --> 00:54:06.835
The pillar itself is probably about...

1409
00:54:06.835 --> 00:54:09.638
it's about five foot wide, so diameter

1410
00:54:09.638 --> 00:54:13.176
is probably pretty long, but you can gather
through your outfit and material

1411
00:54:13.176 --> 00:54:14.260
from your previous outfit as well

1412
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.918
and things you can fashion a piece of material

1413
00:54:15.918 --> 00:54:17.703
that would wrap around, and you can attempt

1414
00:54:17.703 --> 00:54:19.197
to make your way to the front.

1415
00:54:19.197 --> 00:54:21.386
LIAM: Wait just in case, and I hold the little pearl

1416
00:54:21.386 --> 00:54:24.557
up to my forehead and summon geometric designs in the air,

1417
00:54:24.557 --> 00:54:27.260
and I cast Fortune's Favor on you.

1418
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.674
MATT: All right.

1419
00:54:28.674 --> 00:54:29.906
Go ahead and make--
MARISHA: I get a reroll?

1420
00:54:29.906 --> 00:54:31.023
LIAM: Yeah.

1421
00:54:31.023 --> 00:54:33.004
MATT: You're attempting to shimmy up the pole?

1422
00:54:33.004 --> 00:54:34.729
Go ahead and make an athletics check for me.

1423
00:54:34.729 --> 00:54:39.008
LAURA: I touch her shoulder as she's about to go up and--

1424
00:54:39.008 --> 00:54:40.190
SAM: Don't waste any spells.

1425
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:44.974
LAURA: No, just the Traveler and I
both believe in you, okay?

1426
00:54:44.974 --> 00:54:46.442
MARISHA: Thank you, Jess.
LAURA: You're welcome.

1427
00:54:46.442 --> 00:54:48.503
TALIESIN: And I just give Guidance.
MARISHA: Thank you.

1428
00:54:48.503 --> 00:54:51.084
(laughter)

1429
00:54:51.084 --> 00:54:53.437
TRAVIS: A pat on the shoulder and some real shit.

1430
00:54:53.437 --> 00:54:55.349
(laughter)

1431
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:56.919
MARISHA: That's a d4 on checks, right?

1432
00:54:56.919 --> 00:54:58.113
TALIESIN: d4 for a minute.

1433
00:54:58.113 --> 00:55:01.823
LAURA: That was going to be Guidance, thank you very much.

1434
00:55:01.823 --> 00:55:04.445
I was in the process of expelling magic

1435
00:55:04.445 --> 00:55:06.038
from my hand, Caduceus.

1436
00:55:06.038 --> 00:55:07.845
TALIESIN: Oh, I--
LAURA: Now it's just wasted magic.

1437
00:55:07.845 --> 00:55:09.731
TALIESIN: I thought it was just friendship.

1438
00:55:09.731 --> 00:55:10.910
(laughter)

1439
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:13.562
LIAM: That makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. Have a spell.

1440
00:55:13.562 --> 00:55:15.501
(laughter)

1441
00:55:15.501 --> 00:55:17.613
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Okay, athletics?

1442
00:55:17.613 --> 00:55:18.613
MATT: Athletics.

1443
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:21.130
MARISHA: All right.

1444
00:55:22.138 --> 00:55:23.319
Ooh.

1445
00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:26.142
I will use that Fortune's Favor immediately.

1446
00:55:26.142 --> 00:55:27.309
That's better.

1447
00:55:28.622 --> 00:55:30.455
That's not bad either.

1448
00:55:31.448 --> 00:55:32.466
23.

1449
00:55:32.466 --> 00:55:33.495
MATT: That's great.

1450
00:55:33.495 --> 00:55:34.328
Okay.

1451
00:55:35.496 --> 00:55:38.443
It takes you a bit of time, and it is physically strenuous.

1452
00:55:38.443 --> 00:55:41.105
You feel the sweat starting to form on your brow

1453
00:55:41.105 --> 00:55:42.971
even just a quarter up this pillar,

1454
00:55:42.971 --> 00:55:44.113
and you're having to stop and take a break

1455
00:55:44.113 --> 00:55:46.204
every now and then just pulling taut,

1456
00:55:46.204 --> 00:55:48.455
catch your breath, and then continue up again.

1457
00:55:48.455 --> 00:55:52.198
Just (grunting) pull, swing up, pull,

1458
00:55:52.198 --> 00:55:53.471
and just making your way up, you guys are watching--

1459
00:55:53.471 --> 00:55:54.536
MARISHA: Stop whenever I get the shakes.

1460
00:55:54.536 --> 00:55:55.369
MATT: Yeah.

1461
00:55:58.111 --> 00:56:00.553
You are able to see in the darkness,

1462
00:56:00.553 --> 00:56:04.212
so you do not need the specific-- any sort of radial light

1463
00:56:04.212 --> 00:56:06.805
as you approach, but you do manage to get

1464
00:56:06.805 --> 00:56:08.890
towards the very top before it begins to widen,

1465
00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:10.259
and as it begins to widen, it becomes

1466
00:56:10.259 --> 00:56:12.234
more and more difficult to climb

1467
00:56:12.234 --> 00:56:14.351
until eventually you can't go any higher,

1468
00:56:14.351 --> 00:56:17.950
but you are about I'd say 10, 15 feet beneath the roof.

1469
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:19.459
You're about 85 feet up.

1470
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:23.601
MARISHA: Is there any lips, any like, edges?

1471
00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:25.439
MATT: Make a perception check.

1472
00:56:25.439 --> 00:56:27.317
MARISHA: Kind of holding.
TRAVIS: Your burning forearms.

1473
00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:30.193
MARISHA: (hesitant noises)

1474
00:56:30.193 --> 00:56:32.458
(laughter)

1475
00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:34.042
MARISHA: Perception, is that what you said?
MATT: Yep.

1476
00:56:34.042 --> 00:56:36.062
(groaning)

1477
00:56:36.062 --> 00:56:37.084
TRAVIS: Fuck you.

1478
00:56:37.084 --> 00:56:38.031
LIAM: Boo.

1479
00:56:38.031 --> 00:56:39.914
TRAVIS: It was on it twice before it fell off.

1480
00:56:39.914 --> 00:56:41.481
20, two, 20, two.
MARISHA: Five.

1481
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:44.175
MATT: You are losing strength and you see,

1482
00:56:44.175 --> 00:56:47.064
in no way, shape, or form, a handhold

1483
00:56:47.064 --> 00:56:48.931
or any place to grab onto.

1484
00:56:48.931 --> 00:56:50.316
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay.

1485
00:56:50.316 --> 00:56:52.439
MATT: Your arms are starting to give, you're shaking.

1486
00:56:52.439 --> 00:56:54.720
LAURA: I'm just going to stand underneath her

1487
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.132
just in case she falls.

1488
00:56:56.132 --> 00:56:57.004
MATT: Okay.

1489
00:56:57.004 --> 00:56:58.987
MARISHA: I'm going to...

1490
00:57:00.987 --> 00:57:04.196
just look up, and can I start

1491
00:57:04.196 --> 00:57:06.998
calling out glyph shapes?

1492
00:57:06.998 --> 00:57:08.230
Is that weird?

1493
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:09.146
What do I see?

1494
00:57:09.146 --> 00:57:10.313
What do I see!

1495
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.687
MATT: You see a 10-foot diameter red circle

1496
00:57:14.687 --> 00:57:17.142
that is drawn on the ceiling with a series of other lines

1497
00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:19.192
and symbols within it, many connecting--

1498
00:57:19.192 --> 00:57:20.083
TRAVIS: Chalk?

1499
00:57:20.083 --> 00:57:21.704
MARISHA: Yeah, is it chalk or is it carved?

1500
00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:24.795
MATT: You don't see a material, you just see the glow.

1501
00:57:25.787 --> 00:57:27.820
MARISHA: Chalk-- does it look

1502
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.686
rough and quick, or does it look--

1503
00:57:30.686 --> 00:57:33.945
MATT: It looks intentionally placed,

1504
00:57:33.945 --> 00:57:36.795
and it looks deliberate and permanent.

1505
00:57:36.795 --> 00:57:39.046
TRAVIS: How the fuck did he get up here?

1506
00:57:39.046 --> 00:57:41.303
MARISHA: I-- with my remaining strength--

1507
00:57:41.303 --> 00:57:42.501
TALIESIN: It's probably permanent.

1508
00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:44.627
MARISHA: I take out a ball bearing.

1509
00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:47.549
Tink, right in the center of it.

1510
00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:50.032
Throw it up, hit the rune, hit it.

1511
00:57:50.032 --> 00:57:52.431
MATT: It hits the center of the runes.

1512
00:57:52.431 --> 00:57:55.886
Nothing flashes, no glow, it just hits,

1513
00:57:55.886 --> 00:57:59.151
and then continues to fall, and eventually you hear

1514
00:57:59.151 --> 00:58:03.234
ting, ting, ting, ting ting ting ting,

1515
00:58:03.234 --> 00:58:04.733
and you guys hear the--

1516
00:58:04.733 --> 00:58:06.348
LAURA: Watch where you're dropping those things!

1517
00:58:06.348 --> 00:58:08.832
TRAVIS: You know we're going to have to
dispel that thing, right?

1518
00:58:08.832 --> 00:58:10.944
If only we had a rock that just dispelled shit--

1519
00:58:10.944 --> 00:58:13.466
LAURA: Why would we have to dispel it?

1520
00:58:13.466 --> 00:58:14.746
TRAVIS: What'd you say, Davy Crockett?

1521
00:58:14.746 --> 00:58:16.996
(laughter)

1522
00:58:19.683 --> 00:58:23.630
MARISHA: Any other discerning factors I can get from it?

1523
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:25.389
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

1524
00:58:25.389 --> 00:58:27.883
MARISHA: Roll an arcana check.
MATT: If you're trying to glean--

1525
00:58:27.883 --> 00:58:29.481
MARISHA: Do I still have Guidance?

1526
00:58:29.481 --> 00:58:30.314
TALIESIN: No.
MATT: Nope.

1527
00:58:30.314 --> 00:58:31.758
MARISHA: (sighs)

1528
00:58:34.648 --> 00:58:35.481
Okay.

1529
00:58:37.422 --> 00:58:39.019
17.

1530
00:58:39.019 --> 00:58:39.852
MATT: 17.

1531
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:43.876
Only because you've

1532
00:58:45.093 --> 00:58:46.893
been around Caleb for quite some time

1533
00:58:46.893 --> 00:58:49.099
and the base studies you have, you have no idea

1534
00:58:49.099 --> 00:58:52.883
what this glyph does, what its purpose is,

1535
00:58:52.883 --> 00:58:55.818
but you make up enough of the symbols to gather

1536
00:58:55.818 --> 00:58:58.901
it's probably something conjuration-based.

1537
00:59:00.617 --> 00:59:02.469
That's as much as you can make out.

1538
00:59:02.469 --> 00:59:03.872
MARISHA: Oh.

1539
00:59:03.872 --> 00:59:07.750
Okay, I'm going to just grab the fabric

1540
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:11.622
and position my feet and start sliding down the pole.

1541
00:59:11.622 --> 00:59:14.976
MATT: It is a great relief as you
begin to make your way below.

1542
00:59:14.976 --> 00:59:18.597
Still itself a physically tense activity

1543
00:59:18.597 --> 00:59:22.024
to do so safely, until you get within a certain distance

1544
00:59:22.024 --> 00:59:24.771
that you feel comfortable, 40 or so feet for a monk.

1545
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:26.059
LAURA: You can just drop, I got you, I got you.

1546
00:59:26.059 --> 00:59:28.267
Just move your feet, don't hit me in the face.

1547
00:59:28.267 --> 00:59:29.379
Just drop.

1548
00:59:29.379 --> 00:59:32.236
MARISHA: I jump off the pole and then just use her hands

1549
00:59:32.236 --> 00:59:36.590
like little stepping stones, go (clicking) onto the floor.

1550
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:38.346
LAURA: That's pretty cool, not what I had in mind,

1551
00:59:38.346 --> 00:59:39.415
but I liked it.

1552
00:59:39.415 --> 00:59:40.469
MARISHA: Thanks for the hand.

1553
00:59:40.469 --> 00:59:42.356
TRAVIS: (chuckling)

1554
00:59:42.356 --> 00:59:43.556
MARISHA: Well...

1555
00:59:45.247 --> 00:59:47.222
from sneaking into your spellbooks

1556
00:59:47.222 --> 00:59:48.805
and reading them when I've been bored.

1557
00:59:48.805 --> 00:59:50.188
LIAM: Excuse me?

1558
00:59:50.188 --> 00:59:53.817
MARISHA: I think that glyph looks like the ones

1559
00:59:53.817 --> 00:59:56.635
when you like, conjure shit.

1560
00:59:56.635 --> 00:59:58.850
TRAVIS: Like what?

1561
00:59:58.850 --> 00:59:59.683
What do you mean?

1562
00:59:59.683 --> 01:00:00.535
LIAM: Like my cat?

1563
01:00:00.535 --> 01:00:01.769
MARISHA: Yeah.

1564
01:00:01.769 --> 01:00:03.718
Like your cat.

1565
01:00:03.718 --> 01:00:05.250
Or like your cat's claw.

1566
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.873
Or like any time that like, you draw something

1567
01:00:07.873 --> 01:00:10.970
and, like, something comes out of it.

1568
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:11.851
It looked--

1569
01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:15.884
SAM: Beau Beau, is it the exact same
as the glyph on the floor?

1570
01:00:15.884 --> 01:00:17.650
MATT: It is very different.

1571
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:18.600
MARISHA: No.

1572
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.983
This looked--

1573
01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:22.368
LIAM: This is necromantic don't here on the floor.

1574
01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:23.629
This is death.

1575
01:00:23.629 --> 01:00:25.083
MARISHA: And that's conjuration.

1576
01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.074
TALIESIN: Conjuration.

1577
01:00:26.074 --> 01:00:28.855
LAURA: Oh, so they're going to conjure something dead.

1578
01:00:28.855 --> 01:00:30.275
SAM: That seems like a waste.

1579
01:00:30.275 --> 01:00:35.267
TRAVIS: Do you think that glyph is making this space exist?

1580
01:00:35.267 --> 01:00:37.656
I mean, we flew into the mouth of a giant thing.

1581
01:00:37.656 --> 01:00:38.931
LAURA: Yeah, but we're obvilously--

1582
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:40.156
ob-vil-iss-ly--

1583
01:00:40.156 --> 01:00:42.021
in a different place now,

1584
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:44.628
you know, like we're not inside of that thing anymore,

1585
01:00:44.628 --> 01:00:46.894
we're in another plane.

1586
01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.412
TALIESIN: I'm going to start looking around for any sign

1587
01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:50.710
of where an exit to this room might be.

1588
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.409
MATT: Okay. So you begin to just

1589
01:00:52.409 --> 01:00:53.867
pick a direction and start walking?

1590
01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.192
TALIESIN: I'm not going to walk, but I'm like,

1591
01:00:55.192 --> 01:00:57.975
looking to see if there's anything around

1592
01:00:57.975 --> 01:01:01.321
that feels like a path, or if it's just

1593
01:01:01.321 --> 01:01:06.321
the straight beeline, if it's just the beeline to this--

1594
01:01:06.728 --> 01:01:07.820
TRAVIS: Taliesin, when you moved your arms,

1595
01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.850
it was so fast it was a blur.

1596
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:12.100
(laughter)

1597
01:01:15.279 --> 01:01:17.869
TALIESIN: I do a quick run around
the whole place in one second.

1598
01:01:17.869 --> 01:01:19.345
(laughter)

1599
01:01:19.345 --> 01:01:20.984
TRAVIS: Where'd our clothes go?

1600
01:01:20.984 --> 01:01:22.287
(laughter)

1601
01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:23.120
MATT: Okay.

1602
01:01:24.492 --> 01:01:27.219
So make a perception check with disadvantage.

1603
01:01:27.219 --> 01:01:28.052
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1604
01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:30.182
MATT: Because it is mostly dark at

1605
01:01:30.182 --> 01:01:32.042
the distance you're searching.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not going alone.

1606
01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:33.046
Oh, I meant to do that.

1607
01:01:33.046 --> 01:01:35.961
Oh, that's terrible.

1608
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:37.658
That's 17.

1609
01:01:37.658 --> 01:01:38.491
MATT: 17.

1610
01:01:39.477 --> 01:01:42.211
You walk on for the better part of a minute or so

1611
01:01:42.211 --> 01:01:45.735
in one direction, and...

1612
01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.505
the darkness continues.

1613
01:01:47.505 --> 01:01:48.439
Do you press on?

1614
01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:52.364
TALIESIN: No, I'm not going deep,

1615
01:01:52.364 --> 01:01:53.877
I'm just doing a little--

1616
01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:57.926
MATT: You move about like, three or 400 feet away from them,

1617
01:01:57.926 --> 01:02:00.963
like carefully stepping, and there's still

1618
01:02:00.963 --> 01:02:02.469
darkness ahead of you.

1619
01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:03.739
TALIESIN: Okay, I come back.

1620
01:02:03.739 --> 01:02:04.897
MATT: You come back from there? Okay.

1621
01:02:04.897 --> 01:02:07.782
TRAVIS: Three or 400 feet away.

1622
01:02:07.782 --> 01:02:09.336
Shit.

1623
01:02:09.336 --> 01:02:11.999
LIAM: It could be a way for him to get out of here,

1624
01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:15.104
or possibly to summon forms.

1625
01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:18.395
MARISHA: Yeah, because why you put a
teleportation circle on the ceiling?

1626
01:02:18.395 --> 01:02:20.781
LAURA: Well, if he can fly, what difference does it make?

1627
01:02:20.781 --> 01:02:22.638
Or if he can reverse gravity or something,

1628
01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.801
then he all of a sudden-- like what if he has, like,

1629
01:02:24.801 --> 01:02:28.944
a whole other laboratory like up there?

1630
01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:32.213
MARISHA: Did I see another laboratory on the ceiling?

1631
01:02:32.213 --> 01:02:35.135
MATT: You did not, from where you were at the moment, no.

1632
01:02:35.135 --> 01:02:37.216
LIAM: Conjuration covers a number of things.

1633
01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:39.562
Teleportation is one of them, he could be also

1634
01:02:39.562 --> 01:02:42.412
summoning forms, perhaps to inhabit.

1635
01:02:42.412 --> 01:02:43.410
MARISHA: Hmm.

1636
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:44.587
TRAVIS: We have the books, right?

1637
01:02:44.587 --> 01:02:45.420
LIAM: Yeah.

1638
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.290
SAM: We didn't come out of that.

1639
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:47.346
Where did we come from?

1640
01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:50.097
LAURA: From a door, which disappeared, and we have no way

1641
01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:52.701
out of here now, and we're going to be stuck here forever.

1642
01:02:52.701 --> 01:02:54.412
TRAVIS: We have two options.

1643
01:02:54.412 --> 01:02:57.795
Dispel or destroy the glyph, touch the stone.

1644
01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:01.030
SAM: Or step into the glyph.

1645
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:06.030
LIAM: I pulled the gem far away from his little laboratory.

1646
01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.169
I would like to go back to the laboratory

1647
01:03:08.169 --> 01:03:10.338
and search it for anything.

1648
01:03:10.338 --> 01:03:11.932
Because I didn't go into the middle of it.

1649
01:03:11.932 --> 01:03:14.136
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1650
01:03:14.136 --> 01:03:16.595
SAM: I'll come and assist, because I've already

1651
01:03:16.595 --> 01:03:18.989
been over there, I'll point stuff out.

1652
01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:20.349
LIAM: Natural 20.

1653
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:21.482
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Fucking A.

1654
01:03:21.482 --> 01:03:22.993
TALIESIN: Stay as a group.

1655
01:03:22.993 --> 01:03:25.967
MATT: You find a small box that contains

1656
01:03:25.967 --> 01:03:28.755
100 gold worth of powdered silver.

1657
01:03:28.755 --> 01:03:30.496
LAURA: Ooh.

1658
01:03:30.496 --> 01:03:34.937
MATT: You find 1200 gold worth of rare incense.

1659
01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:36.508
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Rare incense?

1660
01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:38.250
MATT: You can see now, they're like small braziers

1661
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:39.780
that are around this ritual circle

1662
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.401
where you can see ash where this incense

1663
01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:45.276
was previously burned as part of
whatever the last ritual was.

1664
01:03:45.276 --> 01:03:46.993
TRAVIS: That's <i>naggy</i> nag champa.

1665
01:03:46.993 --> 01:03:50.310
MATT: You also find, on one of the tables,

1666
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.754
what was once eight, there's now like four missing gaps,

1667
01:03:53.754 --> 01:03:56.556
but there are four pearls that are worth 100 gold each.

1668
01:03:56.556 --> 01:03:58.281
SAM: This is all spell component shit.

1669
01:03:58.281 --> 01:04:01.329
TALIESIN: All very serious spell components.

1670
01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:02.932
MATT: And that's the extent of what's there.

1671
01:04:02.932 --> 01:04:04.530
LIAM: What were the numbers on the powdered silver

1672
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:05.927
and the rare incense?

1673
01:04:05.927 --> 01:04:07.023
MATT: The powdered silver was 100 gold.

1674
01:04:07.023 --> 01:04:08.106
LIAM: 100.

1675
01:04:08.106 --> 01:04:10.487
MATT: Incense was 1200 gold worth of rare incense.

1676
01:04:10.487 --> 01:04:11.320
LIAM: Understood.

1677
01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.168
LAURA: If we do wake him up so that we can get out of here,

1678
01:04:15.168 --> 01:04:17.206
we are going to be in a lot of trouble

1679
01:04:17.206 --> 01:04:19.505
for stealing all of his stuff in here.

1680
01:04:19.505 --> 01:04:22.161
TRAVIS: I think perhaps he's probably all right with it,

1681
01:04:22.161 --> 01:04:23.387
especially if it gets him out.

1682
01:04:23.387 --> 01:04:26.744
Should we throw Caleb's cat at the circle?

1683
01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:30.064
In case it is a teleportation and activates with touch?

1684
01:04:30.064 --> 01:04:31.238
LIAM: Up above?

1685
01:04:31.238 --> 01:04:32.071
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1686
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:33.030
SAM: Or down below.

1687
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:38.030
TRAVIS: And we'd ensure that no common person
could activate it if it's fucking on the ceiling.

1688
01:04:38.044 --> 01:04:40.029
MARISHA: I tried throwing a ball bearing at it.

1689
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:41.212
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

1690
01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:43.059
SAM: That's not a person.

1691
01:04:43.059 --> 01:04:44.892
MARISHA: Neither is a cat.

1692
01:04:44.892 --> 01:04:48.040
TALIESIN: Cat's closer to a person.
TRAVIS: You make a very good point.

1693
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.104
SAM: I mean, I could go up there, and--

1694
01:04:50.104 --> 01:04:51.572
LAURA: What if you teleport away and then

1695
01:04:51.572 --> 01:04:53.884
we don't even know where you are?

1696
01:04:53.884 --> 01:04:58.213
LIAM: Well, we could try Frumpkin, but normally,

1697
01:04:58.213 --> 01:05:01.312
when I use circles to travel for us--

1698
01:05:01.312 --> 01:05:02.487
MARISHA: You have to activate it.

1699
01:05:02.487 --> 01:05:04.149
LIAM: I have to activate it, it takes time

1700
01:05:04.149 --> 01:05:07.563
and it has to be on the same plane of existence.

1701
01:05:07.563 --> 01:05:09.282
And I don't know where we are.

1702
01:05:09.282 --> 01:05:11.112
TRAVIS: Does it look like any other teleportation circles

1703
01:05:11.112 --> 01:05:12.857
we've used, where it's just constant?

1704
01:05:12.857 --> 01:05:16.306
MATT: It's far more intricate than any
you've seen Caleb make.

1705
01:05:16.306 --> 01:05:19.121
MARISHA: But did it feel like a teleportation circle?

1706
01:05:19.121 --> 01:05:21.709
MATT: You wouldn't have the experience to know.

1707
01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:22.940
LAURA: Caleb, get up there and look at it.

1708
01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.483
MATT: You just knew, because you rolled so high,

1709
01:05:24.483 --> 01:05:26.266
you caught an essence of-- it was a

1710
01:05:26.266 --> 01:05:29.016
conjuration school enchantment.
SAM: Do you want to go up there, Caleb?

1711
01:05:29.016 --> 01:05:31.426
LIAM: Well, I can get myself there,

1712
01:05:31.426 --> 01:05:35.443
but I don't know that I will have the intuition.

1713
01:05:35.443 --> 01:05:36.733
SAM: I can get you there.

1714
01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:39.168
TALIESIN: Or if you can get Frumpkin there,

1715
01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.663
then that's another way to take a look at it.

1716
01:05:40.663 --> 01:05:45.456
TRAVIS: DM, the three spells were Soul Jar, Clone, and--

1717
01:05:45.456 --> 01:05:47.906
MATT: Magic Jar, Trap the Soul, and Clone.

1718
01:05:47.906 --> 01:05:50.575
LAURA: I could Polymorph.
MARISHA: Trap the Soul.

1719
01:05:50.575 --> 01:05:51.788
SAM: No, I got him.

1720
01:05:51.788 --> 01:05:53.573
Sorry, Beau.
MARISHA: Huh?

1721
01:05:53.573 --> 01:05:56.100
SAM: I touch Caleb and give him Spider Climb.

1722
01:05:57.542 --> 01:05:59.042
MARISHA: The fuck?

1723
01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:03.781
TRAVIS: We don't know what those do, though.

1724
01:06:03.781 --> 01:06:05.190
MATT: You have no idea.

1725
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:06.357
(laughter)

1726
01:06:06.357 --> 01:06:07.635
LIAM: That is a new trick.

1727
01:06:07.635 --> 01:06:10.566
And I start to climb up the column.

1728
01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:11.836
MARISHA: How are your forearms?

1729
01:06:11.836 --> 01:06:14.451
TRAVIS: If we get fucking left in here, I'll be so pissed!

1730
01:06:14.451 --> 01:06:17.202
MATT: Like a hobo Spider-Man, Caleb--

1731
01:06:17.202 --> 01:06:19.150
LIAM: I'm clean now.
MATT: I know, but the long coat.

1732
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:21.181
LIAM: But I'm fancy purple robes now.

1733
01:06:21.181 --> 01:06:22.345
I got a pretty jacket.

1734
01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.736
MATT: Like a well-dressed hobo Spider-Man.

1735
01:06:23.736 --> 01:06:25.288
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1736
01:06:25.288 --> 01:06:26.300
LIAM: Clean shaven.
MATT: Yeah.

1737
01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.812
LAURA: Caleb, don't forget the promise we all made

1738
01:06:27.812 --> 01:06:30.546
that we wouldn't leave without anybody else and--

1739
01:06:30.546 --> 01:06:34.103
LIAM: I don't want to leave by myself.

1740
01:06:34.103 --> 01:06:36.176
Hold your arms out in case I fall.

1741
01:06:36.176 --> 01:06:37.785
SAM: You won't, you can't.
LAURA: I've got you.

1742
01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:39.406
MARISHA: Ooh, it's orange.

1743
01:06:39.406 --> 01:06:41.406
MATT: You climb up there, and as you're heading

1744
01:06:41.406 --> 01:06:43.474
your way up there, the darkness begins to take,

1745
01:06:43.474 --> 01:06:45.981
you don't have any means of light.

1746
01:06:45.981 --> 01:06:49.114
LIAM: Oh, well, I put the--

1747
01:06:50.431 --> 01:06:52.139
for now the Dancing Lights around me.

1748
01:06:52.139 --> 01:06:54.124
Globules.
MATT: Okay.

1749
01:06:54.124 --> 01:06:56.061
Lights up the space, and as you begin to climb up,

1750
01:06:56.061 --> 01:06:58.235
you can begin to see the red glow
that they kept talking about

1751
01:06:58.235 --> 01:07:01.010
that you couldn't quite make out with your eyes previously.

1752
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.424
And the closer you get, the closer you get,

1753
01:07:02.424 --> 01:07:05.421
you can see now the diameter that is set there.

1754
01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:09.024
The size of it resembles the teleportation circles

1755
01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:13.003
that you've, as far as like it's similar to its size,

1756
01:07:13.003 --> 01:07:15.429
but it's very different in its construction,

1757
01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:18.172
much more intricate, the details in it are

1758
01:07:18.172 --> 01:07:20.956
almost fractal, in some ways.

1759
01:07:20.956 --> 01:07:22.984
Make an arcana check.
MARISHA: Whoa.

1760
01:07:22.984 --> 01:07:27.828
LIAM: Okay, I was going to say does it look like
it indicates more than a single plane?

1761
01:07:27.828 --> 01:07:31.390
I cast Fortune's Favor on myself.

1762
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:32.565
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
SAM: You can do it again.

1763
01:07:32.565 --> 01:07:35.744
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: That is a good call.

1764
01:07:35.744 --> 01:07:37.355
Don't fuck this shit up.

1765
01:07:38.546 --> 01:07:40.096
Oh, uh-huh.

1766
01:07:42.102 --> 01:07:43.915
LIAM: (sighs) Two terrible rolls.

1767
01:07:43.915 --> 01:07:45.848
Arcana, 14.
MATT: 14.

1768
01:07:46.713 --> 01:07:47.684
LIAM: Four and a two.

1769
01:07:47.684 --> 01:07:49.432
MATT: (sighs) You have no idea what this does.

1770
01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.648
You can read that it's conjuration based,

1771
01:07:51.648 --> 01:07:53.705
and there are elements of it that are like,

1772
01:07:53.705 --> 01:07:55.734
familiar, but it's far more advanced

1773
01:07:55.734 --> 01:07:57.805
than anything that you've encountered,

1774
01:07:57.805 --> 01:08:02.805
especially of this type of permanent-based ritual sigil.

1775
01:08:03.034 --> 01:08:05.348
Yeah, you're not able to make out anything else about it.

1776
01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:07.391
LIAM: So I climb a little bit higher,

1777
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:10.311
and I'm hanging from the ceiling like this,

1778
01:08:10.311 --> 01:08:12.417
and I go (snaps fingers), and Frumpkin is right here.

1779
01:08:12.417 --> 01:08:13.250
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1780
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:17.858
LIAM: And I lift him by the scruff, and I reach up and say:

1781
01:08:17.858 --> 01:08:19.214
Touch it, please.

1782
01:08:19.214 --> 01:08:22.119
MARISHA: Just, you dab your cat onto the circle.

1783
01:08:22.119 --> 01:08:24.329
LIAM: He is going to do that, I'm just holding him.

1784
01:08:24.329 --> 01:08:27.002
MATT: Gently wipe your cat against the ceiling.

1785
01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.785
Like, what are you doing?

1786
01:08:28.785 --> 01:08:29.816
Okay, you're just holding-- what are you doing?

1787
01:08:29.816 --> 01:08:32.221
LIAM: I want him to do this, that's what I told him to do.

1788
01:08:32.221 --> 01:08:33.789
To touch it. Yeah.

1789
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:35.975
I don't expect much, but I'm going to try everything.

1790
01:08:35.975 --> 01:08:37.603
MATT: Okay.

1791
01:08:37.603 --> 01:08:40.376
Frumpkin reaches up and like,

1792
01:08:40.376 --> 01:08:45.376
trepidatiously reaches a paw to the center of the circle.

1793
01:08:45.392 --> 01:08:48.831
You watch as a bunch of the lines across it

1794
01:08:48.831 --> 01:08:50.994
begin to glow and connect.

1795
01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:55.324
All of them begin to gather together,

1796
01:08:55.324 --> 01:08:58.598
and then Frumpkin begins to float for a second,

1797
01:08:58.598 --> 01:09:01.906
and then is scattered to atoms.

1798
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:06.712
LIAM: We'll pick you up around the bend, buddy.

1799
01:09:06.712 --> 01:09:08.147
TRAVIS: Scattered to atoms?

1800
01:09:08.147 --> 01:09:09.179
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you mean?

1801
01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:10.820
TRAVIS: Like violently or disappears?

1802
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.413
SAM: Like Mike Teavee?

1803
01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:14.373
(laughter)

1804
01:09:14.373 --> 01:09:16.101
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Sure.

1805
01:09:16.101 --> 01:09:18.828
Frumpkin just vanishes, and in the place where it was,

1806
01:09:18.828 --> 01:09:22.464
the fey essence itself is just a slight cloud

1807
01:09:22.464 --> 01:09:25.051
of sparkle dust that just dissipates.

1808
01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:26.198
TALIESIN: I know what that is.

1809
01:09:26.198 --> 01:09:29.336
LIAM: Down below, everyone hears: So,

1810
01:09:29.336 --> 01:09:31.867
this circle does not like cats.

1811
01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.774
(laughter)

1812
01:09:33.774 --> 01:09:35.989
MARISHA: What do you mean you know what that was?
LIAM: You were saying?

1813
01:09:35.989 --> 01:09:38.984
TALIESIN: Did we see any of this,
did we not see any of this?

1814
01:09:38.984 --> 01:09:41.309
MATT: You see the brief flash on the ceiling above

1815
01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:44.049
as you're watching Caleb go up to the top.

1816
01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:45.056
But yeah, Frumpkin's gone.

1817
01:09:45.056 --> 01:09:46.816
TALIESIN: Haven't seen it yet.
LIAM: Okay, understood.

1818
01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:49.198
TRAVIS: You can see almost everything.

1819
01:09:49.198 --> 01:09:52.037
TALIESIN: If I saw a cat go poof, then I know what this is.

1820
01:09:52.037 --> 01:09:52.870
TRAVIS: You did.

1821
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:56.374
LIAM: I take 30 seconds to memorize what I'm looking at

1822
01:09:56.374 --> 01:09:58.326
and then I start to climb back down.

1823
01:09:58.326 --> 01:10:00.037
TALIESIN: It's a trash can.

1824
01:10:00.037 --> 01:10:01.668
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

1825
01:10:01.668 --> 01:10:04.440
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1826
01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.059
TRAVIS: I don't get the reference.

1827
01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:08.297
MARISHA: If something's not working here,

1828
01:10:08.297 --> 01:10:11.022
you can just get rid of it.

1829
01:10:11.022 --> 01:10:12.065
TALIESIN: Pop it up.

1830
01:10:12.065 --> 01:10:15.812
MARISHA: If your necromancy spell--
TALIESIN: Goes wrong.

1831
01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:19.498
MARISHA: Fails, you just, like Nott said,

1832
01:10:19.498 --> 01:10:21.751
you reverse that gravity and--

1833
01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:23.248
LAURA: That was me, I said that.
SAM: I didn't say it.

1834
01:10:23.248 --> 01:10:24.397
MARISHA: Oh, Jester.
SAM: I don't know what that is.

1835
01:10:24.397 --> 01:10:25.305
LAURA: It's okay.

1836
01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:26.901
MARISHA: It was one of the detectives.

1837
01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:29.575
TRAVIS: Okay, so it's a meat grinder.

1838
01:10:29.575 --> 01:10:30.467
TALIESIN: Maybe.

1839
01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:32.574
TRAVIS: A garbage disposal?
TALIESIN: Makes sense.

1840
01:10:32.574 --> 01:10:34.914
If you're experimenting in a room like this,

1841
01:10:34.914 --> 01:10:37.179
you probably want a way of getting rid of something quick.

1842
01:10:37.179 --> 01:10:38.152
SAM: All right.

1843
01:10:38.152 --> 01:10:40.392
MARISHA: You didn't find anything at the laboratory?

1844
01:10:40.392 --> 01:10:45.149
LIAM: I just found some of the things that
he was working with, some of his components.

1845
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:46.466
TALIESIN: Does it look like the columns keep going

1846
01:10:46.466 --> 01:10:48.711
past the circle in the other direction?

1847
01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.760
MATT: From where you walked, the distance you made,

1848
01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.982
there were no more columns.

1849
01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:53.054
TALIESIN: So this is the end of the columns,

1850
01:10:53.054 --> 01:10:55.723
it just stops here and there's nothing more
other than just like--

1851
01:10:55.723 --> 01:10:57.512
MATT: For as far as you walked, yeah, it just seemed to be--

1852
01:10:57.512 --> 01:11:01.020
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk around the

1853
01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.828
perimeter of this thing

1854
01:11:02.828 --> 01:11:06.043
to see if the columns start again on the other side or not.

1855
01:11:06.043 --> 01:11:08.437
MATT: Are you going further--?

1856
01:11:08.437 --> 01:11:12.612
TALIESIN: We're over at the little testing facility
with the table and the--

1857
01:11:12.612 --> 01:11:13.678
MATT: Correct.

1858
01:11:13.678 --> 01:11:17.186
TALIESIN: So I want to walk around the perimeter of that,

1859
01:11:17.186 --> 01:11:20.160
not in the darkness, but to see--
because there's columns on the outside, right?

1860
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.135
That we've seen.
MATT: Correct.

1861
01:11:21.135 --> 01:11:23.221
TALIESIN: I want to see if they mirror on the other side.

1862
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:26.778
MATT: Okay. Yeah, there are four columns that all encircle

1863
01:11:26.778 --> 01:11:28.212
this central space.

1864
01:11:28.212 --> 01:11:30.711
So they do mirror each other in this so they kind of--

1865
01:11:30.711 --> 01:11:32.723
TALIESIN: But there's no columns-- I was thinking,

1866
01:11:32.723 --> 01:11:34.981
there's columns leading up to it, or no?
There's just the four columns.

1867
01:11:34.981 --> 01:11:35.922
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Okay.

1868
01:11:35.922 --> 01:11:37.011
MATT: From where you guys were previously,

1869
01:11:37.011 --> 01:11:38.741
and from where you walked, you saw no other columns.

1870
01:11:38.741 --> 01:11:39.574
TALIESIN: Okay.

1871
01:11:39.574 --> 01:11:41.432
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's just these four.
MATT: You can keep walking if you want to search

1872
01:11:41.432 --> 01:11:43.712
for columns elsewhere in the chamber, that's up to you.

1873
01:11:43.712 --> 01:11:48.221
LIAM: I would say simultaneously, to make
the most of the spell that Nott has gifted me with,

1874
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:51.604
I'm going to walk up the column again and start exploring

1875
01:11:51.604 --> 01:11:55.396
the ceiling around, and see if there was
anything else that we missed.

1876
01:11:55.396 --> 01:11:58.854
I'm going very carefully, so I don't step on an atomizer.

1877
01:11:58.854 --> 01:12:01.862
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check as you go around.

1878
01:12:01.862 --> 01:12:05.992
TRAVIS: Should I do that thing where I see invisible stuff?

1879
01:12:05.992 --> 01:12:07.102
LIAM: Perception, you said?

1880
01:12:07.102 --> 01:12:08.606
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: 12.

1881
01:12:08.606 --> 01:12:10.985
MATT: 12? All right, you spend--
LIAM: 13.

1882
01:12:10.985 --> 01:12:14.151
MATT: A few minutes, how long is Spider Climb?
An hour, yeah.

1883
01:12:14.151 --> 01:12:16.590
You spend a number of minutes slowly making around

1884
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:17.863
and spiraling outward

1885
01:12:17.863 --> 01:12:22.174
to make a good scan of the vicinity on the roof.

1886
01:12:22.174 --> 01:12:24.305
LIAM: Globules are just hovering.

1887
01:12:24.305 --> 01:12:27.482
MATT: It continues to be just continuation of that stone.

1888
01:12:27.482 --> 01:12:30.378
Once you're outside of those pillars once more,

1889
01:12:30.378 --> 01:12:34.009
it is just ceiling, featureless beyond

1890
01:12:34.009 --> 01:12:35.712
just a continuation of rock.

1891
01:12:35.712 --> 01:12:37.899
SAM: All right, so while he's doing that,

1892
01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:40.076
I turn to Jester and I say: Listen.

1893
01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:40.909
LAURA: Hmm?

1894
01:12:40.909 --> 01:12:43.721
SAM: This is essentially a crime scene.

1895
01:12:43.721 --> 01:12:44.833
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

1896
01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:46.529
SAM: So what happened here?

1897
01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.590
Why don't we reverse engineer this.

1898
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:52.742
Halas is in here, he wants to transfer his soul

1899
01:12:52.742 --> 01:12:56.578
to another body, so he puts it in the ruby, he falls down.

1900
01:12:56.578 --> 01:12:58.713
LAURA: Why would he put it in the ruby before he had

1901
01:12:58.713 --> 01:13:00.546
another body to put it into?

1902
01:13:00.546 --> 01:13:03.923
SAM: Maybe he had one, and he was ready to do the thing,

1903
01:13:03.923 --> 01:13:06.484
the transfer, and something went wrong,

1904
01:13:06.484 --> 01:13:09.379
the body rejected it or fought him,

1905
01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:12.754
or was flushed up the toilet.

1906
01:13:12.754 --> 01:13:14.125
LAURA: That's true.

1907
01:13:14.125 --> 01:13:16.249
SAM: Or maybe it wasn't a good fit.

1908
01:13:16.249 --> 01:13:18.475
TALIESIN: Can we all hear this?
SAM: Yeah, of course.

1909
01:13:18.475 --> 01:13:22.708
Maybe more people keep coming down here through the hole,

1910
01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:25.024
and he keeps trying them out, he keeps

1911
01:13:25.024 --> 01:13:26.969
possessing them with the ruby into--

1912
01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.113
MARISHA: Maybe he was waiting for Yussa.

1913
01:13:30.554 --> 01:13:32.198
SAM: Waiting for Yussa?

1914
01:13:32.198 --> 01:13:34.680
Or waiting for someone worthy?

1915
01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.190
TRAVIS: Who knows how long he's been waiting?

1916
01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:37.504
It might not have been that long to him.

1917
01:13:37.504 --> 01:13:41.296
SAM: Or maybe-- maybe he can't, he's missing something,

1918
01:13:41.296 --> 01:13:43.722
he's missing something he can't get,

1919
01:13:43.722 --> 01:13:46.488
he didn't possess any of us, he had the opportunity.

1920
01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:49.421
Maybe he can't do it right now, he needs something.

1921
01:13:49.421 --> 01:13:52.016
LAURA: Maybe we should look at the ruby and find out.

1922
01:13:52.016 --> 01:13:53.541
SAM: Talk to him?
LAURA: Yeah.

1923
01:13:53.541 --> 01:13:55.666
Maybe we can flip it over, maybe there's a rune

1924
01:13:55.666 --> 01:13:58.389
on the back or something, it was scratched or something,

1925
01:13:58.389 --> 01:14:00.122
and now he can't use it.

1926
01:14:00.122 --> 01:14:03.006
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.
LAURA: What?

1927
01:14:04.071 --> 01:14:06.527
TALIESIN: Have to look at the body.

1928
01:14:06.527 --> 01:14:07.777
SAM: We can do that.

1929
01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.374
LAURA: Yeah, we can go look at the body.

1930
01:14:09.374 --> 01:14:13.049
TALIESIN: But maybe the ruby was a failsafe.

1931
01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:15.510
LIAM: Shlop, shlop, shlop, shlop.

1932
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:19.688
SAM: You mean, he tried to send the soul somewhere else,

1933
01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:21.504
it didn't work, and it went there instead?

1934
01:14:21.504 --> 01:14:24.124
TALIESIN: We killed the heart and a bunch of stuff died.

1935
01:14:24.124 --> 01:14:25.197
LAURA: Oh.

1936
01:14:25.197 --> 01:14:27.024
TALIESIN: Maybe this just happened.

1937
01:14:27.024 --> 01:14:29.765
LAURA: Maybe it just went in there when we killed the heart.

1938
01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.943
TALIESIN: If you were that obsessed with not dying,

1939
01:14:31.943 --> 01:14:35.430
maybe you have an emergency ruby.

1940
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.152
TRAVIS: Yeah, made himself a horcrux.

1941
01:14:37.152 --> 01:14:39.454
TALIESIN: So that the next person who wanders by

1942
01:14:39.454 --> 01:14:41.821
can get you back into something comfortable.

1943
01:14:41.821 --> 01:14:43.334
SAM: You would be able to glean that

1944
01:14:43.334 --> 01:14:44.838
from looking at the body?

1945
01:14:44.838 --> 01:14:47.433
TALIESIN: Well, if the heart's all messed up.

1946
01:14:47.433 --> 01:14:49.139
SAM: Oh, inside the body.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1947
01:14:49.139 --> 01:14:51.196
SAM: Well, let's go look.

1948
01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:53.733
LAURA: But he's alive, you can't cut open--

1949
01:14:53.733 --> 01:14:56.556
TRAVIS: Can I take out the sword and have it glow,

1950
01:14:56.556 --> 01:14:59.884
I'll use the word <i>galas-var</i>, and can I cast

1951
01:14:59.884 --> 01:15:01.371
See Invisibility.

1952
01:15:01.371 --> 01:15:03.071
I'll raise the sword above my head,

1953
01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:04.350
and my eyes sort of flash.

1954
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:05.891
MATT: Okay.

1955
01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:10.286
You glance around the space directly around you.

1956
01:15:10.286 --> 01:15:15.286
The sigil on the floor, the intensity's a little brighter.

1957
01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:19.574
Almost like putting on, you know, certain shades

1958
01:15:19.574 --> 01:15:21.654
that brighten colors a bit.

1959
01:15:21.654 --> 01:15:23.454
You can see the glyph on the ceiling itself

1960
01:15:23.454 --> 01:15:25.911
is a little more visible now.

1961
01:15:25.911 --> 01:15:29.986
But nothing invisible catches your attention.

1962
01:15:29.986 --> 01:15:32.642
SAM: Let's go inspect the body, Mr. Caducey.

1963
01:15:32.642 --> 01:15:34.698
TALIESIN: Let's-- as a group.

1964
01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:35.606
MARISHA: All right.

1965
01:15:35.606 --> 01:15:38.053
TALIESIN: We got the light up, going to head to
the body really quickly.

1966
01:15:38.053 --> 01:15:39.986
LAURA: Okay, we all walk to the body.
MATT: Okay.

1967
01:15:39.986 --> 01:15:40.891
You guys go up--
LIAM: Would you

1968
01:15:40.891 --> 01:15:45.519
like me to put the bubble up,

1969
01:15:45.519 --> 01:15:49.919
so we can talk to this gem from within it?

1970
01:15:49.919 --> 01:15:52.196
TALIESIN: Can we do that?

1971
01:15:52.196 --> 01:15:54.388
LIAM: We can.
SAM: Sound goes through.

1972
01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:55.860
LAURA: But you have to be touching the ruby

1973
01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.752
for him to be able to talk to you.

1974
01:15:57.752 --> 01:15:58.836
LIAM: Is that the case?

1975
01:15:58.836 --> 01:16:02.032
LAURA: That's what it seemed like.
SAM: That's what it worked like with us.

1976
01:16:02.032 --> 01:16:06.169
LAURA: What if I cast Zone of Truth,
and then I hold the ruby,

1977
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:07.723
and I'll know if he's lying to me.

1978
01:16:07.723 --> 01:16:09.300
TRAVIS: Does that work on gems?

1979
01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.477
LAURA: It works on creatures, and a soul
is a creature, right?

1980
01:16:13.477 --> 01:16:15.543
So maybe it will work.

1981
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:21.183
TALIESIN: Maybe.
TRAVIS: I mean,

1982
01:16:21.183 --> 01:16:23.724
we've got to touch that stone.

1983
01:16:23.724 --> 01:16:25.265
It's the only way out of here.
SAM: Caleb,

1984
01:16:25.265 --> 01:16:27.703
do you have any magic that blocks possession

1985
01:16:27.703 --> 01:16:31.735
or transference of souls?

1986
01:16:31.735 --> 01:16:32.804
You're very smart.

1987
01:16:32.804 --> 01:16:33.837
TRAVIS: We have Counterspell,

1988
01:16:33.837 --> 01:16:37.224
but I don't know if it's like that.

1989
01:16:37.224 --> 01:16:39.425
What the hell does Counterspell do?

1990
01:16:39.425 --> 01:16:41.073
LIAM: That just shuts down a spell.

1991
01:16:41.073 --> 01:16:44.731
MARISHA: Well, does he also-- does he take over your body,

1992
01:16:44.731 --> 01:16:47.423
or do you like, do you share a consciousness?

1993
01:16:47.423 --> 01:16:49.103
LAURA: What does the spell say, Caleb?

1994
01:16:49.103 --> 01:16:52.219
SAM: I Jester's Zone of Truth idea, personally.

1995
01:16:52.219 --> 01:16:54.000
Then again, I like most things that you do.

1996
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:54.838
LAURA: Thank you.

1997
01:16:54.838 --> 01:16:57.420
TALIESIN: What does Zone of Truth say?

1998
01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.812
LAURA: Well, it creates, you know, like a little area

1999
01:17:00.812 --> 01:17:03.977
where you kind of-- people that are in it

2000
01:17:03.977 --> 01:17:05.973
can only tell the truth.

2001
01:17:05.973 --> 01:17:09.836
You remember-- I, oh, that wasn't with you, Caduceus.

2002
01:17:09.836 --> 01:17:12.509
TRAVIS: Objectively, two people have touched--

2003
01:17:12.509 --> 01:17:15.503
SAM: Objection!
TRAVIS: Yes. Have touched the stone,

2004
01:17:15.503 --> 01:17:18.922
and he did not seem to overtake either of them

2005
01:17:18.922 --> 01:17:20.088
or any of us.

2006
01:17:20.088 --> 01:17:21.936
We were all within 100 feet.
LAURA: Maybe he's not interested

2007
01:17:21.936 --> 01:17:23.402
in me or Nott.

2008
01:17:23.402 --> 01:17:27.218
SAM: Why would he be

2009
01:17:27.218 --> 01:17:28.568
not interested in us?

2010
01:17:28.568 --> 01:17:30.723
But maybe we can use that to our advantage.

2011
01:17:30.723 --> 01:17:33.796
His poor taste in people, we can still talk to him

2012
01:17:33.796 --> 01:17:35.649
and he won't possess us, we know that's the case.

2013
01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:38.093
LAURA: Maybe I'll just talk up somebody else

2014
01:17:38.093 --> 01:17:39.767
and that way he won't want to use me.

2015
01:17:39.767 --> 01:17:42.994
LIAM: Here's what I'm worried about, that if he does

2016
01:17:42.994 --> 01:17:47.631
possess one of us, that that person is lost

2017
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:50.702
for the foreseeable future, possessed by

2018
01:17:50.702 --> 01:17:55.636
possibly one of the most powerful mortals in history.

2019
01:17:58.735 --> 01:18:00.858
It looks like we are running out of options here,

2020
01:18:00.858 --> 01:18:04.712
but if we do this, I think we combine our plans

2021
01:18:04.712 --> 01:18:09.338
and throw up the dome, and all of us but one

2022
01:18:09.338 --> 01:18:11.671
sits just outside.

2023
01:18:13.017 --> 01:18:15.139
MARISHA: I think it should be me.

2024
01:18:15.139 --> 01:18:15.992
TALIESIN: I do, too.

2025
01:18:15.992 --> 01:18:17.098
SAM: Why?

2026
01:18:17.098 --> 01:18:19.048
MARISHA: You are all magic users.

2027
01:18:19.048 --> 01:18:22.773
TRAVIS: Ah, that's right, and you pop-pop.

2028
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:27.148
MARISHA: If I was a powerful sorcerer, I would want

2029
01:18:27.148 --> 01:18:31.622
to ensure that I still had magic capabilities going forward.

2030
01:18:31.622 --> 01:18:33.666
TRAVIS: We have no idea if the dome would actually interrupt

2031
01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:35.927
an area spell of 100 feet, right?

2032
01:18:35.927 --> 01:18:40.200
LIAM: It would interrupt a spell of that nature.

2033
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:43.456
If he were to come back into his full power,

2034
01:18:43.456 --> 01:18:47.926
he might very easily be able to pull it down, but--

2035
01:18:47.926 --> 01:18:50.493
SAM: Can you tell me this, because I don't know things--

2036
01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:52.009
LIAM: But I want lines of defense.

2037
01:18:52.009 --> 01:18:54.641
SAM: Do we know that he's a sorcerer or a wizard?

2038
01:18:54.641 --> 01:18:55.932
MARISHA: He's a mage, yeah.

2039
01:18:55.932 --> 01:19:00.115
SAM: Mage, but I mean is his magic learned?

2040
01:19:00.115 --> 01:19:02.764
MARISHA: Yeah, it seems like it. He's got spellbooks.

2041
01:19:02.764 --> 01:19:06.095
SAM: Then he could still use your body to cast magic.

2042
01:19:06.095 --> 01:19:08.219
LAURA: And you're pretty willful.

2043
01:19:08.219 --> 01:19:11.219
He kept asking for somebody willful.

2044
01:19:12.472 --> 01:19:14.477
TRAVIS: Jester, you're also very willful.

2045
01:19:14.477 --> 01:19:16.752
LAURA: No, I'm not, I'm very docile.

2046
01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.628
(laughter)

2047
01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:20.611
TALIESIN: I think Beau's got the right idea.

2048
01:19:20.611 --> 01:19:23.387
MARISHA: This place is called The Mage's Bane for a reason.

2049
01:19:23.387 --> 01:19:24.230
LAURA: That is true.

2050
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:26.797
LIAM: I think Beau has the right idea as well.

2051
01:19:26.797 --> 01:19:28.612
LAURA: Can I still cast Zone of Truth?

2052
01:19:28.612 --> 01:19:30.054
TRAVIS: Sure.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2053
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.838
TALIESIN: You'll have to be outside the dome.

2054
01:19:33.838 --> 01:19:35.997
LAURA: Will I? It's not concentration.

2055
01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:41.646
LIAM: I think you could cast it with the rest of us.

2056
01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:43.811
SAM: Well, we are over here at the body,

2057
01:19:43.811 --> 01:19:44.742
do you want to look at the body?

2058
01:19:44.742 --> 01:19:46.748
TALIESIN: It'll also mean that we can't lie.

2059
01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.764
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

2060
01:19:47.764 --> 01:19:48.944
Let's do it.

2061
01:19:48.944 --> 01:19:51.036
LIAM: Wait, let me get the dome up, please.

2062
01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.535
SAM: While he's getting the dome up,

2063
01:19:52.535 --> 01:19:54.520
I'm going to look at the body.
LAURA: Yeah, same.

2064
01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.774
SAM: Any incisions, cuts?
LAURA: Are you going to get the dome up

2065
01:19:56.774 --> 01:20:00.599
next to the ruby?

2066
01:20:01.724 --> 01:20:03.397
LIAM: I wonder if it is better to do it

2067
01:20:03.397 --> 01:20:07.125
away from his circle in the middle, or--

2068
01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:08.726
TALIESIN: I think we do it away and you go

2069
01:20:08.726 --> 01:20:11.122
pick up the ruby and bring it here.

2070
01:20:11.122 --> 01:20:13.171
LIAM: I think so, I think we get away,

2071
01:20:13.171 --> 01:20:18.163
in case he draws any sort of power from the center.

2072
01:20:19.505 --> 01:20:20.534
MARISHA: Shit.

2073
01:20:20.534 --> 01:20:23.728
SAM: Any cuts, scars, scabs?

2074
01:20:23.728 --> 01:20:26.483
MATT: You glance around throughout the body,

2075
01:20:26.483 --> 01:20:28.437
start going through his robes and everything,

2076
01:20:28.437 --> 01:20:29.987
doesn't appear to be anything.

2077
01:20:32.296 --> 01:20:36.176
Interestingly enough, for his age, no scars.

2078
01:20:36.176 --> 01:20:37.509
LAURA: Hmm.
TALIESIN: How's the chest?

2079
01:20:37.509 --> 01:20:40.616
I want to open the shirt and take a look at the chest.

2080
01:20:40.616 --> 01:20:41.935
MATT: The chest appears to be intact.

2081
01:20:41.935 --> 01:20:44.211
TALIESIN: Is the heart beating?
LAURA: How are the abs?

2082
01:20:44.211 --> 01:20:46.318
SAM: Does he wax?

2083
01:20:46.318 --> 01:20:48.901
MATT: He does wax, yeah, it's pretty smooth.

2084
01:20:48.901 --> 01:20:49.773
TALIESIN: Is the heart beating?

2085
01:20:49.773 --> 01:20:51.025
MATT: Pretty polished, the heart is beating.

2086
01:20:51.025 --> 01:20:52.614
TALIESIN: I Detect Undead.

2087
01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:54.220
MATT: No undead aura.

2088
01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:55.856
LAURA: Ooh.

2089
01:20:55.856 --> 01:20:58.731
SAM: How old does he appear to be? And is he a human?

2090
01:20:58.731 --> 01:20:59.797
MATT: Mid 50s or so.

2091
01:20:59.797 --> 01:21:02.033
TALIESIN: Do we have manacles?

2092
01:21:02.033 --> 01:21:03.518
TRAVIS: We do.
LIAM: We do.

2093
01:21:03.518 --> 01:21:05.636
TALIESIN: We should chain him up.
LAURA: Yeah, try using them.

2094
01:21:05.636 --> 01:21:06.998
TRAVIS: I'll pull some of the manacles out.

2095
01:21:06.998 --> 01:21:08.441
LAURA: Aren't they like magical manacles?

2096
01:21:08.441 --> 01:21:10.538
LIAM: We have the magical manacles.

2097
01:21:10.538 --> 01:21:12.786
TRAVIS: I don't know how to respond to that.
LIAM: I don't know where the card is,

2098
01:21:12.786 --> 01:21:13.990
but I know that we have it.

2099
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:17.043
It's the ones from Lorenzo's--
LAURA: They used it on us when

2100
01:21:17.043 --> 01:21:20.087
they kept us from doing spells.

2101
01:21:20.087 --> 01:21:21.822
SAM: All right.
LAURA: Yeah, try that.

2102
01:21:21.822 --> 01:21:23.817
SAM: We'll slap those on his--

2103
01:21:23.817 --> 01:21:26.280
LAURA: It was awful.

2104
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.438
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2105
01:21:27.438 --> 01:21:28.586
SAM: I'm so sorry.

2106
01:21:28.586 --> 01:21:29.909
Are you all right now?
MATT: You place the manacles

2107
01:21:29.909 --> 01:21:32.450
upon the body of Halas.

2108
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.356
You prepare the dome.

2109
01:21:36.356 --> 01:21:38.019
You said you're doing?

2110
01:21:38.019 --> 01:21:41.304
LIAM: Yes, although before I do, I just--

2111
01:21:41.304 --> 01:21:43.323
MARISHA: Yeah?

2112
01:21:43.323 --> 01:21:46.438
Sorry, indigestion, nervous.

2113
01:21:46.438 --> 01:21:47.271
What's up?

2114
01:21:48.201 --> 01:21:49.160
LIAM: Be careful.

2115
01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.405
MARISHA: Yeah.

2116
01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:53.709
Yeah, no, talking to a super genius

2117
01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:56.665
ancient powerful mage, I'll be great.

2118
01:21:56.665 --> 01:21:59.148
LAURA: Beau.
MARISHA: Yeah?

2119
01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:01.964
LAURA: You'll be great.

2120
01:22:01.964 --> 01:22:04.512
MARISHA: Thanks.
LAURA: You're super, super strong.

2121
01:22:04.512 --> 01:22:08.336
SAM: What is she trying to find out, before we do this?

2122
01:22:08.336 --> 01:22:09.310
LIAM: I'm doming it.

2123
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:12.334
LAURA: How to get out of here.
TALIESIN: What do you want, how to get out of here.

2124
01:22:12.334 --> 01:22:14.623
SAM: And Beau is going to be outside the dome?

2125
01:22:14.623 --> 01:22:15.456
TALIESIN: Yep.

2126
01:22:15.456 --> 01:22:16.352
MARISHA: (laughs)

2127
01:22:16.352 --> 01:22:18.276
SAM: Are you sure that one of the people

2128
01:22:18.276 --> 01:22:21.269
who can do Counterspell shouldn't be right next to her?

2129
01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:22.833
TRAVIS: We can step out of the dome and do it.

2130
01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:24.917
LAURA: Whenever. She's going to be right next to the dome.

2131
01:22:24.917 --> 01:22:26.288
TRAVIS: We'll be just on the other side of the glass.

2132
01:22:26.288 --> 01:22:29.267
LIAM: Fjord can literally stand half in and half out.

2133
01:22:29.267 --> 01:22:30.365
SAM: Okay.

2134
01:22:30.365 --> 01:22:32.588
TRAVIS: Yeah, right down the middle.

2135
01:22:32.588 --> 01:22:34.050
(laughter)

2136
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:35.295
TRAVIS: How are you doing?

2137
01:22:35.295 --> 01:22:36.802
LIAM: (as Two-Face) What do you got, motherfucker?

2138
01:22:36.802 --> 01:22:38.145
(laughter)

2139
01:22:38.145 --> 01:22:39.919
MATT: It's pretty great.

2140
01:22:39.919 --> 01:22:42.022
All right, the dome is completed,

2141
01:22:42.022 --> 01:22:44.633
you all step inside except for Beauregard.

2142
01:22:44.633 --> 01:22:45.895
LAURA: Oh, I keep outside of it too,

2143
01:22:45.895 --> 01:22:47.930
because I have to cast Zone of Truth.

2144
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:48.763
MATT: Okay.

2145
01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:52.370
TALIESIN: I'll give you one last Guidance for the roll.

2146
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:54.698
TRAVIS: I really stand half in and half out,

2147
01:22:54.698 --> 01:22:56.555
in the spirit of tonight.

2148
01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:58.404
LIAM: Legs out, though, right?

2149
01:22:58.404 --> 01:22:59.922
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally.

2150
01:22:59.922 --> 01:23:01.767
Yeah, just the lower half.

2151
01:23:01.767 --> 01:23:03.441
TALIESIN: Actually, different,

2152
01:23:03.441 --> 01:23:06.912
I'm going to give you Resistance.
LIAM: Doing the downward dog.

2153
01:23:06.912 --> 01:23:08.608
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you Resistance instead.

2154
01:23:08.608 --> 01:23:09.441
MARISHA: Me?

2155
01:23:09.441 --> 01:23:12.274
SAM: Resistance to?
TALIESIN: You get a d4 to a saving throw.

2156
01:23:12.274 --> 01:23:13.729
MARISHA: Yeah.

2157
01:23:13.729 --> 01:23:16.721
Guess that makes sense.

2158
01:23:16.721 --> 01:23:19.900
SAM: I'll Mage Hand and drag the ruby over.

2159
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.285
MATT: Okay.

2160
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:26.278
The ruby is lifted up and then brought over by the hand,

2161
01:23:26.278 --> 01:23:28.278
the cloth you had thrown over it, Caleb, is still

2162
01:23:28.278 --> 01:23:30.123
draped over it.

2163
01:23:30.123 --> 01:23:32.951
LAURA: I'm going to cast Zone of Truth over the ruby.

2164
01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:33.784
MATT: Okay.

2165
01:23:33.784 --> 01:23:37.891
LAURA: Then I'm going to step into the thing.

2166
01:23:37.891 --> 01:23:41.458
I don't know if it has to make a charisma save.

2167
01:23:41.458 --> 01:23:42.469
MATT: It does.
TRAVIS: This is what it's all about.

2168
01:23:42.469 --> 01:23:43.302
MARISHA: (exciting breathing)

2169
01:23:43.302 --> 01:23:45.915
I haven't been this in-game nervous in a long time.

2170
01:23:45.915 --> 01:23:47.000
TRAVIS: No problem.

2171
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.825
LIAM: The dome is almost completely invisible this time.

2172
01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:51.842
There is just the barest pale blue

2173
01:23:51.842 --> 01:23:53.800
so that we see where the border is,

2174
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.792
but we can see everything.
TRAVIS: Remember this thing is for magic users,

2175
01:23:55.792 --> 01:23:58.436
so he probably wants you.

2176
01:23:58.436 --> 01:23:59.269
MATT: Okay.

2177
01:24:00.601 --> 01:24:03.784
TALIESIN: We can put her down pretty easily if we have to.

2178
01:24:03.784 --> 01:24:04.993
MARISHA: Yeah.

2179
01:24:04.993 --> 01:24:06.254
You guys know.

2180
01:24:06.254 --> 01:24:08.448
MATT: Going to roll with my robot hand.

2181
01:24:08.448 --> 01:24:09.375
LAURA: Ooh.

2182
01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:11.763
TRAVIS: Got to make the sound.
LAURA: What'd you roll?

2183
01:24:11.763 --> 01:24:13.721
MATT: Okay. (unsure sound)

2184
01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:14.696
What's your spell DC?

2185
01:24:14.696 --> 01:24:16.062
LAURA: It's 17.

2186
01:24:16.062 --> 01:24:19.212
I know whether the creature succeeds or fails.

2187
01:24:19.212 --> 01:24:20.986
MATT: Correct, the creature succeeds.

2188
01:24:20.986 --> 01:24:23.575
LAURA: Fuck me, it didn't work.

2189
01:24:23.575 --> 01:24:25.025
But Beau won't be able to lie.

2190
01:24:25.025 --> 01:24:26.056
TRAVIS: Good idea casting it, though.

2191
01:24:26.056 --> 01:24:28.449
LAURA: We can move outside of the zone now, if you want.

2192
01:24:28.449 --> 01:24:29.511
MARISHA: It didn't work on him?

2193
01:24:29.511 --> 01:24:30.683
LAURA: Mm-mm.

2194
01:24:30.683 --> 01:24:32.746
MARISHA: Then I'll move outside of it.

2195
01:24:32.746 --> 01:24:34.337
SAM: You can just dump it.

2196
01:24:34.337 --> 01:24:36.035
LAURA: No, I want to leave it up.

2197
01:24:36.035 --> 01:24:38.381
MATT: You move outside of the zone.

2198
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:39.516
MARISHA: Because it didn't work on him, right?

2199
01:24:39.516 --> 01:24:40.525
MATT: Nope.

2200
01:24:40.525 --> 01:24:41.766
MARISHA: On the gem?

2201
01:24:41.766 --> 01:24:43.491
MATT: No, it did not.

2202
01:24:44.564 --> 01:24:45.481
TRAVIS: Let's go.

2203
01:24:46.772 --> 01:24:48.557
MARISHA: (sighs)
MATT: Okay.

2204
01:24:48.557 --> 01:24:50.664
You grab the stone, you look towards it.

2205
01:24:50.664 --> 01:24:53.131
You can see, deep within the swirling,

2206
01:24:53.131 --> 01:24:55.316
multi-colored mists within the ruby,

2207
01:24:55.316 --> 01:24:59.096
the red transitions internally to other colors,

2208
01:24:59.096 --> 01:25:01.725
and you can see two amber-colored eyes,

2209
01:25:01.725 --> 01:25:04.035
just irises, that are bright yellow amber colored

2210
01:25:04.035 --> 01:25:07.634
and looking right at you, and the voice goes,

2211
01:25:07.634 --> 01:25:11.708
"I was wondering where you all had gone.

2212
01:25:11.708 --> 01:25:14.032
"I'm happy to see that you have not

2213
01:25:14.032 --> 01:25:16.930
"abandoned the conversation."

2214
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:18.747
MARISHA: No, not yet.

2215
01:25:19.759 --> 01:25:21.514
I'm Beau, by the way.

2216
01:25:21.514 --> 01:25:23.011
MATT: "Beau."

2217
01:25:23.011 --> 01:25:25.345
"I am Halas Lutagran.

2218
01:25:25.345 --> 01:25:29.444
"I am thankful for your aid and your keen eye.

2219
01:25:29.444 --> 01:25:33.983
"And I promise you riches, boons, whatever you need,

2220
01:25:33.983 --> 01:25:37.863
"should you be willing to dispel this gem of imprisonment

2221
01:25:37.863 --> 01:25:39.668
"that I have found myself in."

2222
01:25:39.668 --> 01:25:40.501
MARISHA: Ah.

2223
01:25:42.056 --> 01:25:44.499
And then what would you do?

2224
01:25:44.499 --> 01:25:46.025
Where would you go?

2225
01:25:46.025 --> 01:25:48.149
MATT: "I would stay here. I built all of this.

2226
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:51.283
"You have seen, I assume, to have gotten this far,

2227
01:25:51.283 --> 01:25:54.324
"what I'm capable of creating."

2228
01:25:54.324 --> 01:25:55.413
MARISHA: What happened?

2229
01:25:55.413 --> 01:25:58.599
Why aren't you in your body anymore?

2230
01:25:58.599 --> 01:26:01.015
MATT: "I had been

2231
01:26:02.182 --> 01:26:05.716
"toying with various

2232
01:26:05.716 --> 01:26:08.574
"arcane means of testing the boundaries

"of one's mortal shell,

2234
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:15.474
"and I had this gem specifically commissioned

2235
01:26:15.474 --> 01:26:17.639
"for this purpose.

2236
01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:20.229
"But it appears the design was sabotaged

2237
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:23.068
"by one of my many enemies, I assume,

2238
01:26:23.068 --> 01:26:26.634
"and I found myself unable to escape it.

01:26:27.871 --> 01:26:31.779
"A rare moment of

"a lack of foresight

2241
01:26:33.704 --> 01:26:37.017
"and care on my part."
MARISHA: Interesting.

2242
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.258
Who was the person that sabotaged you?

2243
01:26:40.258 --> 01:26:42.517
MATT: "I can only imagine.

2244
01:26:42.517 --> 01:26:45.565
"There are many, many that would love

"to see me in this state.

"should we keep this between us.

2248
01:26:53.407 --> 01:26:55.922
"We'll keep this between us, yes?"

2249
01:26:55.922 --> 01:26:56.972
MARISHA: Maybe.

2250
01:26:58.569 --> 01:27:01.352
Have any idea how long you been in there?

2251
01:27:01.352 --> 01:27:03.779
MATT: "I have no idea.

2252
01:27:03.779 --> 01:27:06.038
"With the time dilation, I have been unable to adjust,

"in the rapid progress, I believe?"

2255
01:27:13.143 --> 01:27:16.072
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Totally rapid progress.

2256
01:27:16.072 --> 01:27:20.842
MATT: "How long have you been inside these halls, then?"

2257
01:27:20.842 --> 01:27:23.248
MARISHA: Oh, a couple weeks.

2258
01:27:23.248 --> 01:27:24.332
MATT: "A couple weeks?

2259
01:27:24.332 --> 01:27:26.640
"Much time has passed on your--

2260
01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.186
"I assume you hail from Exandria, yes?"

2261
01:27:31.186 --> 01:27:32.019
MARISHA: Maybe.

2262
01:27:33.806 --> 01:27:38.722
MATT: "You are stubbornly forthright not at all.

2263
01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:44.391
"You may not be aware, but a lot of time is passing

2264
01:27:44.391 --> 01:27:46.065
"in your home plane."

2265
01:27:46.065 --> 01:27:47.025
MARISHA: No, I'm aware.

2266
01:27:47.025 --> 01:27:49.012
MATT: "All right. There are ways to disable that.

2267
01:27:49.012 --> 01:27:51.446
"There is actually a portion, as part of my design

2268
01:27:51.446 --> 01:27:53.804
"of this device, to adjust the passage of time,

"slower, quickly, or begin the normal passage.

01:27:58.297 --> 01:28:01.801
"I previously set it in a advanced case,

"as I was hoping to bypass a few nuisances, and...

"But then here I've been, and I guess the rest

"you already know, since you look at me

"with such a already well-informed expression."

2276
01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:26.670
MARISHA: Well, you have left quite the trail of little
shrines

2277
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:31.192
behind yourself, so yeah, we put the pieces together.

2278
01:28:31.192 --> 01:28:33.200
Nice color scheme, by the way.

2279
01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.084
Like the red and the gold.

2280
01:28:35.084 --> 01:28:36.367
MATT: "Branding is important."

2281
01:28:36.367 --> 01:28:37.387
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2282
01:28:37.387 --> 01:28:41.103
TRAVIS: Beau, how's it going?

2283
01:28:41.103 --> 01:28:43.818
LIAM: He's talkative, we take it?

2284
01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:46.417
MARISHA: Hey, Halas, can you hold for one second?

2285
01:28:46.417 --> 01:28:47.734
MATT: "Certainly."

2286
01:28:48.882 --> 01:28:50.047
MARISHA: Tink.

2287
01:28:50.047 --> 01:28:51.699
SAM: ♪ ("The Girl From Ipanema") ♪

2288
01:28:51.699 --> 01:28:53.370
MARISHA: He wants us to let him out.

2289
01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:55.746
He wants to go back into his body.

2290
01:28:55.746 --> 01:28:59.480
He promised us riches and any boons that we wanted.

2291
01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.488
SAM: So he's stuck in there.

2292
01:29:00.488 --> 01:29:03.097
LAURA: What did you say about two weeks for?

2293
01:29:03.097 --> 01:29:04.804
MARISHA: Oh, he was asking how long we've been in here,

2294
01:29:04.804 --> 01:29:07.199
and then he's like, "Oh, you know, a lot of time has passed

2295
01:29:07.199 --> 01:29:08.907
"between this time and the next,"

2296
01:29:08.907 --> 01:29:10.065
and I was like, "Yeah, I already know that."

2297
01:29:10.065 --> 01:29:12.708
TRAVIS: Did you ask him what the
symbols on the roof are for?

2298
01:29:12.708 --> 01:29:13.925
MARISHA: No, I haven't gotten that far yet.

2299
01:29:13.925 --> 01:29:15.591
SAM: What about how to get him out?

2300
01:29:15.591 --> 01:29:18.940
MARISHA: He said he wanted a little Dispel Magic.

2301
01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.437
SAM: Dispel Magic?
LAURA: That's all it takes?

2302
01:29:20.437 --> 01:29:23.152
MARISHA: That's what he said, right?

2303
01:29:23.152 --> 01:29:24.384
Dispel, he's like dispel this?

2304
01:29:24.384 --> 01:29:26.370
MATT: He said to dispel the gem of imprisonment

2305
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:27.530
he's found himself in, yes.

2306
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:29.518
MARISHA: Dispel the gem of imprisonment.

2307
01:29:29.518 --> 01:29:31.071
LAURA: A gem of imprisonment.

2308
01:29:31.071 --> 01:29:34.026
Oh, he thought it was a regular one

2309
01:29:34.026 --> 01:29:35.788
and then it is a trappy one.

2310
01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:37.153
TALIESIN: That's why he can't actually possess anybody.

2311
01:29:37.153 --> 01:29:38.916
LAURA: What a stupid guy.

2312
01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:41.920
MARISHA: Right, yeah, well he said one of his lackeys

2313
01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.179
or colleagues sabotaged the gem.

2314
01:29:46.179 --> 01:29:48.183
TRAVIS: Can he hear us talking about him?

2315
01:29:48.183 --> 01:29:49.533
MARISHA: Can he hear?
MATT: You're not currently holding the gem,

2316
01:29:49.533 --> 01:29:51.374
I assume.
MARISHA: No, I put it down.

2317
01:29:51.374 --> 01:29:53.106
MATT: You have no idea.

2318
01:29:53.106 --> 01:29:55.842
LAURA: I mean, he's pretty cool and stuff, but

2319
01:29:55.842 --> 01:29:58.858
that was a pretty dumb move, is all.

2320
01:29:58.858 --> 01:30:00.999
TRAVIS: Keep working him. Come on, you've got leverage.

2321
01:30:00.999 --> 01:30:03.017
What do the symbols do, how do we get out of here,

2322
01:30:03.017 --> 01:30:04.066
how would we dispel it?

2323
01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:05.742
MARISHA: We don't want to let him out, right?

2324
01:30:05.742 --> 01:30:07.130
LAURA: I mean, if he's only thing that--
SAM: We promise him

2325
01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:09.844
whatever he wants to get information.

2326
01:30:09.844 --> 01:30:11.455
LAURA: Does he seem nice?

2327
01:30:11.455 --> 01:30:13.793
MARISHA: He seems charming.

2328
01:30:13.793 --> 01:30:15.379
LAURA: Tell him how long he's actually been trapped

2329
01:30:15.379 --> 01:30:17.640
and see if he starts crying.

2330
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.473
TALIESIN: Wow.

2331
01:30:18.473 --> 01:30:20.016
MARISHA: But I don't know how long he's been trapped.

2332
01:30:20.016 --> 01:30:25.016
LAURA: Well, I mean, tell him nobody's heard of him in--

2333
01:30:25.745 --> 01:30:26.899
MARISHA: Centuries or something.

2334
01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:28.322
LAURA: I mean, I think it has been that long.

2335
01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:30.126
MARISHA: I think it has, too.

2336
01:30:30.126 --> 01:30:31.623
LAURA: Ask him what year he thinks it is.

2337
01:30:31.623 --> 01:30:33.721
MARISHA: He also said something though, about how he can

2338
01:30:33.721 --> 01:30:36.054
adjust the timing, and he can like,

2339
01:30:36.054 --> 01:30:37.806
undo the time and shit, though.

2340
01:30:37.806 --> 01:30:40.381
LAURA: Maybe he can go back in time.

2341
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.062
SAM: Go back, talk more.

2342
01:30:45.062 --> 01:30:47.045
LAURA: See if he starts crying.

2343
01:30:47.045 --> 01:30:48.462
SAM: Make him cry, Beau.

2344
01:30:48.462 --> 01:30:50.554
TALIESIN: You really want to make a ruby cry.

2345
01:30:50.554 --> 01:30:53.091
MARISHA: All right, Halas, you still there?

2346
01:30:53.091 --> 01:30:54.937
MATT: "Yes, Beau?"

2347
01:30:54.937 --> 01:30:57.973
MARISHA: Yep, it's me. Thanks for waiting.

2348
01:30:57.973 --> 01:31:00.147
Okay, so listen.

2349
01:31:01.572 --> 01:31:05.013
I am kind of the acting liaison for the Mighty Nein

2350
01:31:05.013 --> 01:31:06.920
in this incidence.
LAURA: Ask him what year he thinks it is!

2351
01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.536
MARISHA: (stuttering)

2352
01:31:08.536 --> 01:31:10.776
What year do you think it is?

2353
01:31:11.737 --> 01:31:14.341
MATT: "What does it matter?"

2354
01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:15.174
MARISHA: I don't know, do you want to

2355
01:31:15.174 --> 01:31:17.565
know how long you've been in here?

2356
01:31:17.565 --> 01:31:19.641
MATT: "Well, what year is it for you?"

2357
01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:21.809
MARISHA: The year is (whispering) what year is it?

2358
01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.746
TALIESIN: What year is this?

2359
01:31:23.746 --> 01:31:27.059
MATT: I believe by this time it would be 836 PD.

2360
01:31:27.059 --> 01:31:28.511
LIAM: Wyld Stallyns!

2361
01:31:28.511 --> 01:31:30.044
MARISHA: It's 836 PD.

2362
01:31:32.452 --> 01:31:35.186
MATT: "Well, based on the fact that we are now working

2363
01:31:35.186 --> 01:31:39.373
"through time in a different eon than I am familiar with--"

2364
01:31:39.373 --> 01:31:41.215
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah.

2365
01:31:41.215 --> 01:31:45.356
MATT: "Not knowing what PD refers to, and 800--

2366
01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:46.772
"Wow. It has been--

2367
01:31:46.772 --> 01:31:48.906
TRAVIS: (laughs) "Oh wow."

2368
01:31:48.906 --> 01:31:50.716
MATT: "That is very problematic."

2369
01:31:50.716 --> 01:31:51.610
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

2370
01:31:51.610 --> 01:31:53.710
MATT: "It's-- oh no."

2371
01:31:55.135 --> 01:31:56.908
TRAVIS: We rocked his noodle?

2372
01:31:56.908 --> 01:31:57.949
MARISHA: By the way.

2373
01:31:57.949 --> 01:31:59.848
(laughter)

2374
01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:04.848
TRAVIS: When the gem wizard says "Wow," shit's fucked up.

2375
01:32:05.272 --> 01:32:06.781
MARISHA: I set him down really quick.

2376
01:32:06.781 --> 01:32:08.550
LIAM: Gozer says, come again?

2377
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:09.506
MATT: Yep.

2378
01:32:09.506 --> 01:32:12.518
MARISHA: I set him down really quick. He said no.

2379
01:32:12.518 --> 01:32:14.636
LAURA: Did he sound sad when he said no?

2380
01:32:14.636 --> 01:32:17.067
MARISHA: He said he didn't know what eon it was.

2381
01:32:17.067 --> 01:32:18.111
I pick it back up.

2382
01:32:18.111 --> 01:32:20.741
SAM: Ask him how to change bodies permanently.

2383
01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:22.446
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm getting there, I'm getting there.

2384
01:32:22.446 --> 01:32:24.146
It's a lot, a lot, okay, I pick it back up.

2385
01:32:24.146 --> 01:32:25.349
Okay.

2386
01:32:25.349 --> 01:32:27.526
Sorry, sorry, just I dropped you,

2387
01:32:27.526 --> 01:32:28.747
I dropped you for a second.

2388
01:32:28.747 --> 01:32:30.747
MATT: "(sighs)"

2389
01:32:32.237 --> 01:32:35.052
LAURA: Ask him if he's a good wizard or a bad wizard.

2390
01:32:35.052 --> 01:32:36.871
SAM: Ask him how to get out of here.

2391
01:32:36.871 --> 01:32:38.670
LIAM: Ask him if he can hear all of us talking.

2392
01:32:38.670 --> 01:32:42.576
MARISHA: Can you hear my dumb team shouting behind me?

2393
01:32:42.576 --> 01:32:45.257
MATT: "No, but I can communicate with you,

2394
01:32:45.257 --> 01:32:46.839
"as you are holding the gem."

2395
01:32:46.839 --> 01:32:48.207
MARISHA: Right, right, right, right.

2396
01:32:48.207 --> 01:32:51.728
Okay, so look, we'd love to help you out.

2397
01:32:51.728 --> 01:32:55.230
You know, because we're very kind and giving people.

2398
01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:56.516
MATT: "I assumed that much.

2399
01:32:56.516 --> 01:32:58.905
"You seem to be very curious folk."

2400
01:32:58.905 --> 01:33:00.128
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2401
01:33:00.128 --> 01:33:02.628
MATT: "Curious means you're useful."

2402
01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.818
MARISHA: All right, that,

2403
01:33:05.818 --> 01:33:07.887
you know, it sounds a little ominous,

2404
01:33:07.887 --> 01:33:10.231
when you put it like that, you do realize that, right?

2405
01:33:10.231 --> 01:33:13.393
Like, nothing about what you just said is trustworthy.

2406
01:33:13.393 --> 01:33:15.625
TRAVIS: Stay on target, stay on target, come on.

2407
01:33:15.625 --> 01:33:19.006
MATT: "Why are you here? Why have you wandered these halls?"

2408
01:33:19.006 --> 01:33:20.489
TALIESIN: Might as well tell him the truth.

2409
01:33:20.489 --> 01:33:22.027
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

2410
01:33:22.027 --> 01:33:24.308
MARISHA: You familiar with an Arcanist Yussa?

2411
01:33:24.308 --> 01:33:25.533
TRAVIS: Nope.

2412
01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:26.791
MATT: "I am not."

2413
01:33:26.791 --> 01:33:29.374
TRAVIS: Remember, 800 years? "Wow"? Time shift?

2414
01:33:29.374 --> 01:33:33.265
MARISHA: Well, I don't know, maybe Yussa came through here.

2415
01:33:34.565 --> 01:33:38.378
Well, we got this ball a little bit ago,

2416
01:33:38.378 --> 01:33:40.503
and then we actually came in a few months ago.

2417
01:33:40.503 --> 01:33:43.886
Your dragon, super pissed, by the way.

2418
01:33:43.886 --> 01:33:46.490
You kind of left him hanging.

2419
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:47.323
What?

2420
01:33:48.439 --> 01:33:50.184
TALIESIN: No, no, I'm for this.

2421
01:33:50.184 --> 01:33:51.264
LAURA: Oh gosh.

2422
01:33:51.264 --> 01:33:54.733
MARISHA: And then we came in here looking for another mage

2423
01:33:54.733 --> 01:33:57.310
that got sucked into your happy fun ball,

2424
01:33:57.310 --> 01:34:01.128
and stumbled into here.

2425
01:34:01.128 --> 01:34:03.049
TALIESIN: We were just trying to get somebody out.

2426
01:34:03.049 --> 01:34:05.190
MARISHA: Yeah, and now we're trying to get out.

2427
01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:09.270
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, ask him maybe how we can help him and us
get out.

2428
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:10.975
MARISHA: I'm working on it!

2429
01:34:10.975 --> 01:34:14.225
You jumped my line, man. I was working on my pitch.

2430
01:34:14.225 --> 01:34:15.947
LIAM: I can only hear your half of the conversation.

2431
01:34:15.947 --> 01:34:17.819
MARISHA: And you heard me building up to my pitch.

2432
01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:19.598
LIAM: I have no idea what's going on!

2433
01:34:19.598 --> 01:34:21.136
MARISHA: So here's the thing, man.

2434
01:34:21.136 --> 01:34:23.111
You want to get out, we want to get out,

2435
01:34:23.111 --> 01:34:24.734
everyone wants to get out, right?

2436
01:34:24.734 --> 01:34:26.074
LIAM: Is there a fly on my head?

2437
01:34:26.074 --> 01:34:27.998
MATT: "I think that sounds like

2438
01:34:27.998 --> 01:34:30.698
a reasonable comparison, yes."

2439
01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:34.005
MARISHA: So we can grab your body, scoop it up,

2440
01:34:34.005 --> 01:34:36.981
you can tell us how to get out of here,

2441
01:34:36.981 --> 01:34:41.531
then we'll let you out, we can go our separate ways.

2442
01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:43.537
Or be friends, I don't know. Do you want to be friends?

2443
01:34:43.537 --> 01:34:44.484
Do you like friends?

2444
01:34:44.484 --> 01:34:45.914
LAURA: Ask him if he's nice.
SAM: Make him cry.

2445
01:34:45.914 --> 01:34:48.126
MARISHA: Are you nice?

2446
01:34:48.126 --> 01:34:49.059
Do you cry?

2447
01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:50.541
LIAM: It's a lot of questions.

2448
01:34:50.541 --> 01:34:52.102
LAURA: Ask him if he's sad right now.

2449
01:34:52.102 --> 01:34:53.435
MARISHA: Okay, hang on.

2450
01:34:56.423 --> 01:34:58.610
MATT: There's a long sigh.

2451
01:34:59.596 --> 01:35:02.344
MARISHA: This is why people don't like us, by the way.

2452
01:35:02.344 --> 01:35:04.135
TRAVIS: Grab the--

2453
01:35:04.135 --> 01:35:04.968
MARISHA: Keep going.

2454
01:35:04.968 --> 01:35:06.633
LIAM: Just how we get out.

2455
01:35:06.633 --> 01:35:08.532
MATT: "Morality is relative, and I do not know

2456
01:35:08.532 --> 01:35:11.062
"by your standards what is considered nice or useful,

2457
01:35:11.062 --> 01:35:13.401
"so I would say, given the lack of information

2458
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:18.401
"we have about each other, I myself can also prove useful.

2459
01:35:18.513 --> 01:35:21.041
"Imagine an individual responsible for creating

2460
01:35:21.041 --> 01:35:23.714
"such the space that you've found yourself in now

2461
01:35:23.714 --> 01:35:26.567
"could be capable of doing quite a few things in your favor.

2462
01:35:26.567 --> 01:35:30.526
"If you were to take my body, and take this gem,

2463
01:35:30.526 --> 01:35:32.426
"and manage to find a way out of the sphere,

2464
01:35:32.426 --> 01:35:33.942
"I can guide you."

2465
01:35:33.942 --> 01:35:35.501
LIAM: I really don't like the long pauses.

2466
01:35:35.501 --> 01:35:37.650
MATT: "Then we could be useful to each other."

2467
01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:40.680
TRAVIS: He did imprison the Permaheart.

2468
01:35:41.521 --> 01:35:43.666
TALIESIN: He didn't necessarily know what it was.

2469
01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:46.583
TRAVIS: He's been using it, and studying it.

2470
01:35:46.583 --> 01:35:48.772
We need an ally, we need to make friends.

2471
01:35:48.772 --> 01:35:51.101
LAURA: Ask him if he wants to be a lich.

2472
01:35:51.101 --> 01:35:51.934
SAM: What?

2473
01:35:51.934 --> 01:35:54.421
MARISHA: That's kind of where I was going.

2474
01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:59.246
Yeah, Halas, we've kind of picked up on a few themes

2475
01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:02.427
and interests of yours.

2476
01:36:03.392 --> 01:36:04.667
MATT: "Such as?"

2477
01:36:06.325 --> 01:36:08.108
MARISHA: Cloning yourself.

2478
01:36:09.155 --> 01:36:12.243
MATT: "Well, that is a relatively standard means

2479
01:36:12.243 --> 01:36:17.243
"of continuing one's existence in a dangerous time of war."

2480
01:36:17.456 --> 01:36:18.494
LIAM: "Pretty standard."

2481
01:36:18.494 --> 01:36:20.936
MARISHA: Not anymore.

2482
01:36:20.936 --> 01:36:24.573
That war is long gone.

2483
01:36:24.573 --> 01:36:29.573
In fact, I mean, we're in another war, but no, actually.

2484
01:36:29.614 --> 01:36:32.465
What you're doing is kind of taboo now.

2485
01:36:32.465 --> 01:36:36.038
Most people don't really like necromancy.

2486
01:36:36.038 --> 01:36:38.679
MATT: "Well, that's unfortunate."
MARISHA: Yeah.

2487
01:36:38.679 --> 01:36:41.345
MATT: "Well, they don't have to worry about it.

2488
01:36:41.345 --> 01:36:44.458
"I keep to my experiments, they keep to their interests.

2489
01:36:44.458 --> 01:36:47.034
"What I do here is not guided by the laws

2490
01:36:47.034 --> 01:36:49.967
"and morals of the rest of Exandria.

2491
01:36:49.967 --> 01:36:52.830
"And what I do does not hurt anyone.

2492
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:56.250
"What, how old are you?"
MARISHA: Does it?

2493
01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:01.125
MARISHA: Apparently, time isn't relevant, right, Halas?

2494
01:37:01.125 --> 01:37:04.245
MATT: "I'm asking you a question, as you've asked me many.

2495
01:37:04.245 --> 01:37:05.578
"How old are you?"

2496
01:37:06.818 --> 01:37:07.651
MARISHA: 26.

2497
01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:09.681
MATT: "Very young."

2498
01:37:09.681 --> 01:37:11.094
MARISHA: Yeah.

2499
01:37:11.094 --> 01:37:15.135
MATT: "But you, I can tell, have seen some terrible things

2500
01:37:15.135 --> 01:37:16.218
"in your time.

2501
01:37:17.866 --> 01:37:20.793
"People you care about taken away."

2502
01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:22.966
MARISHA: You can see all that through this?

2503
01:37:22.966 --> 01:37:26.466
MATT: "No, I can sense it, in the way you talk.

2504
01:37:28.961 --> 01:37:33.711
"For every person you've lost, what if it was unnecessary?

2505
01:37:35.198 --> 01:37:38.267
"What if there was a way to shrug off these confines

2506
01:37:38.267 --> 01:37:41.777
"of expected mortality that might have worked

2507
01:37:41.777 --> 01:37:46.752
"by the designs of some inferior, self-imposed deities?

2508
01:37:48.302 --> 01:37:53.219
"Would you not be curious enough to pursue that
possibility?"

2509
01:37:55.028 --> 01:37:57.707
MARISHA: Interesting temptations coming from the man

2510
01:37:57.707 --> 01:38:01.371
who got himself trapped in a ruby.

2511
01:38:01.371 --> 01:38:04.175
MATT: "Look, I'm not proud of it.

2512
01:38:04.175 --> 01:38:07.362
"But when you focus intently on specific ideas,

2513
01:38:07.362 --> 01:38:11.743
"sometimes you lose track of the small details,

2514
01:38:11.743 --> 01:38:14.657
"a mistake I will not make again."

2515
01:38:14.657 --> 01:38:16.032
TRAVIS: Oh, if he mentioned a war,

2516
01:38:16.032 --> 01:38:17.456
you should ask who was fighting

2517
01:38:17.456 --> 01:38:19.393
and perhaps mention some of our foes,

2518
01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:20.642
see if they ring any bells.

2519
01:38:20.642 --> 01:38:22.615
TALIESIN: Or more to the point, see who he was favoring.

2520
01:38:22.615 --> 01:38:24.689
MARISHA: I'm working on it, I'm building the thing,

2521
01:38:24.689 --> 01:38:26.253
you keep interrupting.

2522
01:38:26.253 --> 01:38:27.728
(sighs)

2523
01:38:27.728 --> 01:38:29.183
LIAM: We're actually sitting in silence quite a bit.

2524
01:38:29.183 --> 01:38:30.743
TALIESIN: Pretty much.

2525
01:38:30.743 --> 01:38:31.972
MARISHA: All right, Halas.

2526
01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:32.805
MATT: "Yes."

2527
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.656
MARISHA: You know, I kind of feel, as they say,

2528
01:38:35.656 --> 01:38:38.171
the devil is in the details, and if you are

2529
01:38:38.171 --> 01:38:43.171
messing with things that are necromantic in nature

2530
01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:47.664
that maybe you wouldn't want to be clumsy,

2531
01:38:47.664 --> 01:38:49.605
as you were, so.

2532
01:38:49.605 --> 01:38:53.805
MATT: "So quick to judge the term 'necromantic'

2533
01:38:53.805 --> 01:38:55.505
"or 'necromancy.'

2534
01:38:55.505 --> 01:38:58.503

"a weaver of things arcane?"

2539
01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.251
MARISHA: I don't know, what do you think?

2540
01:39:11.251 --> 01:39:13.696
You've said you can sense a lot about me.

2541
01:39:13.696 --> 01:39:14.799
MATT: "(chuckling)

2542
01:39:14.799 --> 01:39:17.290
"This is not how this works.

"pulling you from the brink of death

01:39:22.821 --> 01:39:27.821
"and watching all of your cuts and hemorrhages reversed?"

2546
01:39:27.878 --> 01:39:30.089
MARISHA: Okay, I get the point you're making.
MATT: "That's necromancy."

2547
01:39:30.089 --> 01:39:30.930
MARISHA: Yeah, I get it.

2548
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:33.174
MATT: "There are many things that stem from necromancy.

MARISHA: Yeah, anyone could've told you that one was coming.

2553
01:39:44.806 --> 01:39:47.844
Oh, he called me ignorant.

2554
01:39:47.844 --> 01:39:48.731
Okay.

2555
01:39:48.731 --> 01:39:50.551
TRAVIS: It's going well, good conversation.

2556
01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:52.303
SAM: How do we get out of here!

2557
01:39:52.303 --> 01:39:54.142
MARISHA: Wait for a--!

2558
01:39:54.142 --> 01:39:58.261
Okay, you mentioned a war, so what war is that

2559
01:39:58.261 --> 01:39:59.738
that you're referring to?

2560
01:39:59.738 --> 01:40:02.529
Because I have some big fucking news flashes for you

2561
01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:04.189
that I haven't even gotten to yet.

2562
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:05.898
So what war were you talking about?

2563
01:40:05.898 --> 01:40:10.898
MATT: (chuckles) "There's conflict all
across the world at many times."

2564
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:12.493
MARISHA: Yeah.

2565
01:40:12.493 --> 01:40:17.293
MATT: "There were those who were unhappy with the

2566
01:40:18.798 --> 01:40:21.014
"ruling of the various deities,

2567
01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:23.287
"and as such, the Betrayers rose up against them

2568
01:40:23.287 --> 01:40:25.176
"in that conflict.

2569
01:40:25.176 --> 01:40:27.679
"Some of us were no longer of interest

2570
01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:31.394
"of the shackles left in our endeavors.

2571
01:40:31.394 --> 01:40:34.251
"Many of the various city-states began to fracture

2572
01:40:34.251 --> 01:40:36.260
"while others joined together.

2573
01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.755
"There are many conflicts there.

2574
01:40:38.755 --> 01:40:43.755
"So which war in particular
of that realm are you interested?

2575
01:40:44.321 --> 01:40:46.187
"I was not part of any.

2576
01:40:46.187 --> 01:40:48.343
"These things do not concern me, I was more focused

2577
01:40:48.343 --> 01:40:51.676
"on building my own abode."

2578
01:40:52.674 --> 01:40:57.673
MARISHA: Well, one of your little Betrayer God experiments,

2579
01:40:59.662 --> 01:41:03.485
the Laughing Hand, does that ring a bell?

2580
01:41:03.485 --> 01:41:08.226
MATT: "Yes, that was connected with

2581
01:41:08.226 --> 01:41:10.609
"the unique sort of

2582
01:41:11.955 --> 01:41:15.705
"divine mutation that I was researching."

2583
01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:19.320
MARISHA: Yeah, well, he's kind of stomping

2584
01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.207
around the world right now wreaking havoc.

2585
01:41:22.207 --> 01:41:26.790
MATT: (chuckling) Divinity is useless.

2586
01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:31.381
MARISHA: And this Permaheart?

2587
01:41:32.702 --> 01:41:35.564
MATT: "Yes, has its uses.

2588
01:41:35.564 --> 01:41:38.226
"But I care not for this Laughing Hand."

2589
01:41:38.226 --> 01:41:40.226
MARISHA: What use is it to you?

2590
01:41:41.339 --> 01:41:42.566
MATT: (sighs)

2591
01:41:42.566 --> 01:41:46.759
"Death is an inconvenience one of my experience

2592
01:41:46.759 --> 01:41:51.659
"and power is not willing to kowtow to.

2593
01:41:52.715 --> 01:41:55.917
"So I would seek other means of prolonging one's life

2594
01:41:55.917 --> 01:42:00.917
"without having to give in to such base,

2595
01:42:01.074 --> 01:42:04.048
"easy transitions, such as lichdom

2596
01:42:04.048 --> 01:42:06.266
"or means of undeath,

2597
01:42:06.266 --> 01:42:10.701
"and the whole deal is messy,
and difficult to control, and--"

2598
01:42:10.701 --> 01:42:12.332
MARISHA: Dying?

2599
01:42:12.332 --> 01:42:13.690
MATT: "Undying."

2600
01:42:18.806 --> 01:42:23.697
MARISHA: And you tempting us with being able to alter time.

2601
01:42:26.028 --> 01:42:28.302
What does that mean?

2602
01:42:28.302 --> 01:42:30.665
MATT: "Not altering time outside of this vicinity,

2603
01:42:30.665 --> 01:42:33.509
"but the things that are shackled to the tower machine

2604
01:42:33.509 --> 01:42:36.321
"can be transitioned to move slower or quicker

2605
01:42:36.321 --> 01:42:41.031
"relative to the Prime Material Plane and others."

2606
01:42:41.031 --> 01:42:43.466
MARISHA: All right, we're going to
continue to have this conversation,

2607
01:42:43.466 --> 01:42:45.969
but I want to get out of this room
because it's fucking boring.

2608
01:42:45.969 --> 01:42:49.089
MATT: "Oh, you're stuck inside the donjon. (chuckles)"

2609
01:42:49.089 --> 01:42:52.562
MARISHA: The Don John, what?

2610
01:42:52.562 --> 01:42:54.379
MATT: "Well, I assume that, seeing as how you are here,

2611
01:42:54.379 --> 01:42:59.029
"you walked into the mouth of the dreadnought, and

2612
01:42:59.029 --> 01:43:03.178
"I will say, quite impressive or extremely stupid,

2613
01:43:03.178 --> 01:43:07.329
"either way, you are within the dreadnought's donjon."

2614
01:43:07.329 --> 01:43:09.481
MARISHA: You're saying dungeon, right?

2615
01:43:09.481 --> 01:43:11.293
MATT: "More or less.

2616
01:43:11.293 --> 01:43:14.665
"It is a space that is contained within its belly

2617
01:43:14.665 --> 01:43:17.750
"and outside of its belly at the same time.

2618
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:19.714
"There is no escape out here, aside from

2619
01:43:19.714 --> 01:43:21.749
"shifting between the planes.

2620
01:43:21.749 --> 01:43:26.741
"But I may have a means of

2621
01:43:26.741 --> 01:43:28.099
"showing you out,

2622
01:43:28.099 --> 01:43:31.901
"if you agree to take the gem and my body with you."

2623
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:34.392
MARISHA: We'll take the gem and your body.

2624
01:43:34.392 --> 01:43:35.392
MATT: "All right."

2625
01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.700
MARISHA: All right.

2626
01:43:39.272 --> 01:43:40.105
LIAM: What, what, what?

2627
01:43:40.105 --> 01:43:40.938
TRAVIS: Are you talking to us?

2628
01:43:40.938 --> 01:43:42.481
MARISHA: Yep.

2629
01:43:42.481 --> 01:43:45.511
I'm going to put you down for a minute, Halas.

2630
01:43:45.511 --> 01:43:48.167
Round up his body, he's going to guide us out of here.

2631
01:43:48.167 --> 01:43:50.256
SAM: In exchange for?

2632
01:43:50.256 --> 01:43:53.639
MARISHA: He wants us to let him out,

2633
01:43:53.639 --> 01:43:54.989
and I tell him all of that.

2634
01:43:54.989 --> 01:43:57.315
MATT: Yeah, you exchange information with the party.

2635
01:43:57.315 --> 01:43:58.872
LAURA: He sounds really nice, I like him.

2636
01:43:58.872 --> 01:44:00.632
SAM: But he never explained to you exactly

2637
01:44:00.632 --> 01:44:02.621
how we're going to release his body.

2638
01:44:02.621 --> 01:44:06.047
MARISHA: I think it's an ongoing conversation,

2639
01:44:06.047 --> 01:44:08.812
but I don't want to really like end up saying something

2640
01:44:08.812 --> 01:44:10.398
or piss the guy off when he's agreed

2641
01:44:10.398 --> 01:44:11.547
to guide us out of here.
LAURA: I mean, the truth of the matter

2642
01:44:11.547 --> 01:44:12.438
is, you know,

2643
01:44:12.438 --> 01:44:15.035
if it wasn't illegal or anything when he was around,

2644
01:44:15.035 --> 01:44:17.595
you know, then maybe he didn't know it was bad,

2645
01:44:17.595 --> 01:44:21.318
and really, is it bad if it's not hurting anyone?

2646
01:44:21.318 --> 01:44:22.549
SAM: No, I don't think so.

2647
01:44:22.549 --> 01:44:24.385
TRAVIS: We don't have a choice.
MARISHA: There's something about him.

2648
01:44:24.385 --> 01:44:26.560
TALIESIN: I'm wary of him.

2649
01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.579
LAURA: I don't like that he called you ignorant, Beau.

2650
01:44:29.579 --> 01:44:30.595
MARISHA: There's something about him.

2651
01:44:30.595 --> 01:44:34.779
For a guy who seems so steadfast in his knowledge

2652
01:44:34.779 --> 01:44:38.128
and confident in his abilities,

2653
01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:44.578
I seem to rile him up pretty quickly.

2654
01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.682
TRAVIS: That's also you.

2655
01:44:46.682 --> 01:44:50.025
MARISHA: Yeah, I know, I know, but this one's different,

2656
01:44:50.025 --> 01:44:51.038
this one's different.
TRAVIS: But we're inside

2657
01:44:51.038 --> 01:44:52.530
the belly of a dreadnought

2658
01:44:52.530 --> 01:44:55.084
that we can only escape through a Plane Shift spell,

2659
01:44:55.084 --> 01:44:57.540
which Caleb, you cannot do, correct?

2660
01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:01.257
LIAM: The best I could do would be to Banish one of you away

2661
01:45:01.257 --> 01:45:03.205
to a random spot in our world.

2662
01:45:03.205 --> 01:45:06.168
LAURA: Well, I could do it. No, no, no, Banish,

2663
01:45:06.168 --> 01:45:08.582
we could cast it at a higher level,

2664
01:45:08.582 --> 01:45:11.586
and I could Banish multiple people.

2665
01:45:11.586 --> 01:45:13.601
SAM: To where?
TRAVIS: To a specific plane?

2666
01:45:13.601 --> 01:45:18.470
LAURA: To the plane that they are from.

2667
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:21.175
LIAM: But without a pinpoint location.

2668
01:45:21.175 --> 01:45:23.628
LAURA: Right, so if we banished multiples,

2669
01:45:23.628 --> 01:45:26.494
everyone might end up in different places.

2670
01:45:26.494 --> 01:45:29.950
LIAM: Or in the ocean, or 500 feet in the air, or--

2671
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:30.979
TRAVIS: Or a volcano.

2672
01:45:30.979 --> 01:45:33.308
MARISHA: Well look, I mean, he's offering to guide us out,

2673
01:45:33.308 --> 01:45:35.860
I mean, we can try and just get to the door of this place

2674
01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:37.102
and then decide from there.

2675
01:45:37.102 --> 01:45:38.867
LIAM: From within there he's going to explain it?

2676
01:45:38.867 --> 01:45:40.350
MARISHA: Yeah.

2677
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:42.351
LAURA: He can just walk us through it.

2678
01:45:42.351 --> 01:45:44.210
MARISHA: I'm not going to throw him back in his body

2679
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:46.832
until he tells us how to get out of here, so no.

2680
01:45:46.832 --> 01:45:50.242
TALIESIN: Here's the thing, there's
nothing wrong with a contract.

2681
01:45:50.242 --> 01:45:53.499
So we've got somebody we need to get out of here,

2682
01:45:53.499 --> 01:45:57.282
we need to get out of here, and maybe a little help

2683
01:45:57.282 --> 01:46:00.889
dealing with what we're going
to be facing on the other side.

2684
01:46:00.889 --> 01:46:03.030
That's three requests just for this,

2685
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:06.317
I feel like that's fair, and then for that,

2686
01:46:06.317 --> 01:46:08.485
we'll put him back where he should be.

2687
01:46:08.485 --> 01:46:10.064
MARISHA: He could be very useful to us.

2688
01:46:10.064 --> 01:46:10.897
I just--

2689
01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:13.542
LIAM: We would be fools to take him at his word on anything.

2690
01:46:13.542 --> 01:46:15.316
MARISHA: Agreed.
LAURA: Well, yeah, but--

2691
01:46:15.316 --> 01:46:17.758
TALIESIN: It's better to have somebody's word broken

2692
01:46:17.758 --> 01:46:19.239
than to have no word at all.

2693
01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:20.734
TRAVIS: We're also fucked for choice.

2694
01:46:20.734 --> 01:46:22.078
SAM: I will say this.

2695
01:46:22.078 --> 01:46:24.964
I sort of empathize with him, you know,

2696
01:46:24.964 --> 01:46:29.702
he wants to be out of this thing he's in,

2697
01:46:29.702 --> 01:46:32.047
he wants his life back, he wants--

2698
01:46:32.047 --> 01:46:32.996
TALIESIN: This is his house.

2699
01:46:32.996 --> 01:46:36.860
SAM: He wants his life back, and that's something

2700
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:40.482
that's worthy. However, I will say this,

2701
01:46:40.482 --> 01:46:42.950
we do have one more option.

2702
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:46.530
Possibly, we could talk to Allura.

2703
01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:47.696
LAURA: Yeah, I can call her again.

2704
01:46:47.696 --> 01:46:50.069
SAM: Maybe she can get us out of here,

2705
01:46:50.069 --> 01:46:52.608
and if she can't, then we're fucked.

2706
01:46:52.608 --> 01:46:54.736
MARISHA: Or she could just give us insight on

2707
01:46:54.736 --> 01:46:56.378
if appeasing him is a bad idea.
TRAVIS: Great idea.

2708
01:46:56.378 --> 01:46:57.886
TALIESIN: That's actually really clever.

2709
01:46:57.886 --> 01:46:58.719
TRAVIS: Great idea.

2710
01:46:58.719 --> 01:46:59.736
MARISHA: Yeah, let's give her a call.

2711
01:46:59.736 --> 01:47:00.833
TRAVIS: Crack out that fucking mirror.

2712
01:47:00.833 --> 01:47:01.958
LIAM: And just leave him on hold.

2713
01:47:01.958 --> 01:47:05.214
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was raising my hand for earlier.

2714
01:47:05.214 --> 01:47:09.656
Has it been 24 hours since the first time that I used it?

2715
01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:10.643
Technically.

2716
01:47:10.643 --> 01:47:12.237
MATT: You used it--
SAM: (like Jester) Technically.

2717
01:47:12.237 --> 01:47:13.823
LAURA: Technically I've used it three times.

2718
01:47:13.823 --> 01:47:15.417
MATT: You have.
SAM: But we slept.

2719
01:47:15.417 --> 01:47:17.038
LAURA: But we slept.

2720
01:47:17.038 --> 01:47:18.278
MATT: You slept twice.

2721
01:47:18.278 --> 01:47:19.552
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Twice in here?

2722
01:47:19.552 --> 01:47:21.759
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: That's 16 hours, or--

2723
01:47:21.759 --> 01:47:23.911
MATT: I'd say it's been probably about,

2724
01:47:23.911 --> 01:47:25.350
past the cusp of 24 hours.

2725
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:26.720
LAURA: Okay, so I can use it again?

2726
01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.662
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

2727
01:47:28.662 --> 01:47:29.704
All right.

2728
01:47:29.704 --> 01:47:30.705
MATT: So you--

2729
01:47:30.705 --> 01:47:32.692
LAURA: I bamf it out.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2730
01:47:32.692 --> 01:47:33.761
LAURA: Allura?

2731
01:47:33.761 --> 01:47:35.210
MATT: (yawns) "Yes?"

2732
01:47:35.210 --> 01:47:36.764
LAURA: Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you up?

2733
01:47:36.764 --> 01:47:37.638
MATT: "It's all right."

2734
01:47:37.638 --> 01:47:39.587
SAM: If you talk faster, it'll be more normal for her.

2735
01:47:39.587 --> 01:47:41.992
LAURA: No, if I-- oh yeah, okay, Allura,

2736
01:47:41.992 --> 01:47:43.083
(quickly) so here's the deal,

2737
01:47:43.083 --> 01:47:44.816
we went into the mouth of a dreadnought,

2738
01:47:44.816 --> 01:47:47.369
and it turns out that it opened this other plane

2739
01:47:47.369 --> 01:47:49.287
or something and now we're stuck in this thing,

2740
01:47:49.287 --> 01:47:50.741
and we found the body of Halas,

2741
01:47:50.741 --> 01:47:52.288
but he's trapped in a little ruby,

2742
01:47:52.288 --> 01:47:53.369
and he's asking to be let out,

2743
01:47:53.369 --> 01:47:55.180
and he seems sad about the fact that he's been

2744
01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:57.804
trapped for so long, but everyone's unsure

2745
01:47:57.804 --> 01:48:00.744
whether or not we should do it, and then we're like--

2746
01:48:00.744 --> 01:48:01.827
SAM: Say donjon.

2747
01:48:01.827 --> 01:48:02.660
LAURA: Oh hey, donjon?
SAM: Yeah.

2748
01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:05.271
LAURA: Then we, oh yeah, we're in the donjon.

2749
01:48:05.271 --> 01:48:07.266
Then we were like, "oh, you know,

2750
01:48:07.266 --> 01:48:10.591
"maybe Allura can help us, she might know how to get out,

2751
01:48:10.591 --> 01:48:14.400
"because you have to be able to shift planes or something."

2752
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.507
MATT: "All right.

2753
01:48:15.507 --> 01:48:18.765
"That pace was easier to follow than usual.

2754
01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.605
"I'll be right there, one more second.

2755
01:48:21.605 --> 01:48:23.178
LAURA: Who you talking to?

2756
01:48:23.178 --> 01:48:24.477
MATT: "My wife, I woke her up."

2757
01:48:24.477 --> 01:48:27.004
LAURA: Aww! Can I see her?

2758
01:48:28.086 --> 01:48:32.594
MATT: "No. No, she's trying to sleep."

2759
01:48:33.461 --> 01:48:35.203
She turns the mirror away.

2760
01:48:35.203 --> 01:48:37.453
(laughter)

2761
01:48:39.597 --> 01:48:41.983
"Okay, trying to go over this.

2762
01:48:41.983 --> 01:48:44.352
"So you went into a dreadnought's belly."

2763
01:48:44.352 --> 01:48:45.685
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

2764
01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:48.932
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2765
01:48:48.932 --> 01:48:52.924
MATT: "I would not know how to get there

2766
01:48:53.856 --> 01:48:56.764
"to even attempt to get you out."

2767
01:48:56.764 --> 01:48:58.705
LAURA: That's a good point.

2768
01:49:00.144 --> 01:49:02.456
MATT: (sighs)

2769
01:49:02.456 --> 01:49:07.005
LAURA: Yeah, you'd have to like come into the, right.

2770
01:49:07.005 --> 01:49:09.764
TRAVIS: Can't Amazon Prime the Plane
Shift spell in here, can you?

2771
01:49:09.764 --> 01:49:12.753
MATT: "And you're certain that he's
trapped within this gem?"

2772
01:49:12.753 --> 01:49:13.597
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2773
01:49:13.597 --> 01:49:16.008
He said he was in, what is it called?

2774
01:49:16.008 --> 01:49:17.860
MARISHA: A gem of imprisonment.

2775
01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:20.277
LAURA: A gem of imprisonment.

2776
01:49:21.131 --> 01:49:24.413
MARISHA: He thought it was a jar, a magic jar, but it--

2777
01:49:24.413 --> 01:49:25.442
TALIESIN: Soul jar.

2778
01:49:25.442 --> 01:49:28.720
MARISHA: But then they said it was someone sabotaged him.

2779
01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:31.594
LAURA: Tricked him! And he got stuck in it instead.

2780
01:49:31.594 --> 01:49:34.915
MATT: "If this was a magic jar, and he has not yet attempted

2781
01:49:34.915 --> 01:49:37.281
"to possess any of you, he's either being extremely clever

2782
01:49:37.281 --> 01:49:40.953
"or he's indeed trapped in this gem.

2783
01:49:40.953 --> 01:49:42.370
"Whatever you do, be careful.

2784
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:44.885
"Take everything with a grain of salt.

2785
01:49:44.885 --> 01:49:47.038
"How confident are you in manipulating

2786
01:49:47.038 --> 01:49:49.121
"somebody of this mage's--"

2787
01:49:50.558 --> 01:49:52.454
TRAVIS: Not at all.
SAM: Extremely.

2788
01:49:52.454 --> 01:49:54.976
LAURA: Oh, like the Control Person or something?

2789
01:49:54.976 --> 01:49:58.242
MATT: "Just manipulate, or at least to not give

2790
01:49:58.242 --> 01:50:00.100
"too much information and get--"
LAURA: Oh my god, we are

2791
01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:02.516
so good at manipulating people.
SAM: We're secretive.

2792
01:50:02.516 --> 01:50:04.079
We're conniving.

2793
01:50:04.079 --> 01:50:06.727
LAURA: We constantly get things the way that we want them,

2794
01:50:06.727 --> 01:50:08.949
people have no idea that we're so secretive.

2795
01:50:08.949 --> 01:50:10.298
But we aren't like that at all with you

2796
01:50:10.298 --> 01:50:12.266
because we really like you and you're cool.

2797
01:50:12.266 --> 01:50:13.666
MATT: "I appreciate the candor.

2798
01:50:13.666 --> 01:50:16.408
"I would say then, utilize the skills

2799
01:50:16.408 --> 01:50:18.960
"that you have at your disposal, as you say,

2800
01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.946
"Be mindful not to give too much information.

2801
01:50:22.021 --> 01:50:24.721
"Ask questions more than answer them,

2802
01:50:25.615 --> 01:50:29.386
"and whatever you do, do not give him what he wants

2803
01:50:29.386 --> 01:50:32.922
"until we've had an opportunity to discuss this in person.

2804
01:50:32.922 --> 01:50:36.731
"I would like to see this gem."

2805
01:50:39.456 --> 01:50:40.539
LAURA: You got it, so.

2806
01:50:40.539 --> 01:50:43.835
TRAVIS: Hold up the gem.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2807
01:50:43.835 --> 01:50:45.788
MARISHA: Well no, I'm not going to hold it up,

2808
01:50:45.788 --> 01:50:46.838
I'm going to put it down.

2809
01:50:46.838 --> 01:50:49.209
LAURA: No, I put the mirror over the gem, go whoa.

2810
01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:50.042
MATT: "It's very pretty."

2811
01:50:50.042 --> 01:50:51.924
MARISHA: I flip it to the other side, to the back side.

2812
01:50:51.924 --> 01:50:52.999
MATT: "That's also very pretty."

2813
01:50:52.999 --> 01:50:54.671
LIAM: DM, just to clarify, I cast Identify

2814
01:50:54.671 --> 01:50:57.940
and it pinpointed it as a gem of imprisonment, correct?

2815
01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.378
MATT: No, it--

2816
01:50:59.378 --> 01:51:01.961
MARISHA: Or were those just his words?

2817
01:51:02.919 --> 01:51:04.869
LIAM: No, I cast a spell.
MATT: Correct.

2818
01:51:04.869 --> 01:51:06.447
You do know that not every object can be identified

2819
01:51:06.447 --> 01:51:08.246
by a 1st-level spell if it doesn't want to.

2820
01:51:08.246 --> 01:51:09.079
LIAM: Okay.

2821
01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:13.418
MATT: And for this device to have bypassed

2822
01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:15.772
the attention of such a powerful mage,

2823
01:51:15.772 --> 01:51:18.102
you get the sense that whatever might have been

2824
01:51:18.102 --> 01:51:21.104
altered by this is not identified through--

2825
01:51:21.104 --> 01:51:23.989
LIAM: Okay, so in an arcane sense, magic eight ball

2826
01:51:23.989 --> 01:51:25.442
came up and said "outlook cloudy"?

2827
01:51:25.442 --> 01:51:27.523
MATT: Kinda.
LIAM: All right.

2828
01:51:27.523 --> 01:51:29.935
TALIESIN: I think we know the deal we have to make, then.

2829
01:51:29.935 --> 01:51:32.102
MATT: "I do have to go.

2830
01:51:34.257 --> 01:51:35.139
"I have to sleep.

2831
01:51:35.139 --> 01:51:37.155
"I'm keeping my wife awake."

2832
01:51:37.155 --> 01:51:40.210
LAURA: Okay, well, we're going to talk to this guy,

2833
01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:42.266
Halas, and he's going to get us out of here I guess,

2834
01:51:42.266 --> 01:51:45.231
and then we just won't let him out,

2835
01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:47.093
and then I'll send you a message

2836
01:51:47.093 --> 01:51:48.001
when we're on the other side.

2837
01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.191
MATT: "Please do."
LAURA: Okay.

2838
01:51:49.191 --> 01:51:50.024
MATT: "All right."
MARISHA: Yeah, tell her it

2839
01:51:50.024 --> 01:51:50.940
might be time to start

2840
01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:53.372
making her way back to the tower, meet her there.

2841
01:51:53.372 --> 01:51:54.983
LAURA: Well, I'm assuming she can bamf in

2842
01:51:54.983 --> 01:51:56.828
like she did before, so she doesn't need like,

2843
01:51:56.828 --> 01:51:59.515
a lot of time to prepare, right, because you're so powerful?

2844
01:51:59.515 --> 01:52:01.531
MATT: "Right, and based on the time dilation

2845
01:52:01.531 --> 01:52:05.577
"that I'm still experiencing, preferably just

2846
01:52:05.577 --> 01:52:07.456
"let me know when you land."

2847
01:52:07.456 --> 01:52:09.242
LAURA: You got it.

2848
01:52:09.242 --> 01:52:10.295
MATT: "All right."

2849
01:52:10.295 --> 01:52:12.384
LAURA: Sleep well, my beautiful wizard.

2850
01:52:12.384 --> 01:52:13.491
SAM: What are you doing?

2851
01:52:13.491 --> 01:52:15.150
Why would you, what are you doing?

2852
01:52:15.150 --> 01:52:17.458
(laughter)

2853
01:52:17.458 --> 01:52:19.015
MATT: "Goodnight."

2854
01:52:19.015 --> 01:52:22.753
The reflection returns to the mirror.

2855
01:52:22.753 --> 01:52:24.772
TALIESIN: So I think the deal we make is

2856
01:52:24.772 --> 01:52:27.613
we get us and our friend who's trapped in the prison--

2857
01:52:27.613 --> 01:52:29.279
LIAM: (quietly) Not our friend.

2858
01:52:30.316 --> 01:52:32.099
TALIESIN: Our benefactor.

2859
01:52:33.324 --> 01:52:35.299
Our prey?

2860
01:52:35.299 --> 01:52:37.731
We get our mission complete, which is

2861
01:52:37.731 --> 01:52:39.580
to get this person out of here.

2862
01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:41.419
LIAM: It's so cool to get this speech from The Flash.

2863
01:52:41.419 --> 01:52:42.461
TALIESIN: I know.

2864
01:52:42.461 --> 01:52:45.040
(laughter)

2865
01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.166
LAURA: I know, it's weird to do
this voice in this outfit too.

2866
01:52:47.166 --> 01:52:48.761
TALIESIN: I'm going to take it off for part two.

2867
01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:49.950
MATT: (as Allura) Doing Allura as this has been very unique,

2868
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:50.950
let me tell you.

2869
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:52.846
I can only imagine what it is for you.

2870
01:52:52.846 --> 01:52:54.921
LIAM: However, this feels totally normal.

2871
01:52:54.921 --> 01:52:57.064
(laughter)

2872
01:52:57.064 --> 01:52:58.489
TALIESIN: We make a deal that all of us,

2873
01:52:58.489 --> 01:53:00.613
including the one person we're looking for,

2874
01:53:00.613 --> 01:53:01.998
gets out of here alive,

2875
01:53:01.998 --> 01:53:04.840
and then we'll take him and his body and the ruby out,

2876
01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.171
and then the person that he helps get out there

2877
01:53:07.171 --> 01:53:10.449
will then look into getting him back into his body.

2878
01:53:10.449 --> 01:53:12.849
LAURA: Here, here, ask him about the Prison of Soot.

2879
01:53:12.849 --> 01:53:14.163
SAM: The what?

2880
01:53:14.163 --> 01:53:15.744
LAURA: The Prison of Soot, where Yussa is.

2881
01:53:15.744 --> 01:53:17.619
TRAVIS: Good call.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2882
01:53:17.619 --> 01:53:18.452
MARISHA: All right.
TRAVIS: Do it.

2883
01:53:18.452 --> 01:53:19.510
MARISHA: Picking it up.

2884
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:22.312
Don't say anything you don't want him to know.

2885
01:53:22.312 --> 01:53:23.918
SAM: He can't hear us.

2886
01:53:23.918 --> 01:53:25.558
MARISHA: Oh, right.
LAURA: He can't hear us, only you.

2887
01:53:25.558 --> 01:53:27.278
MARISHA: Don't say anything you don't want him to know.

2888
01:53:27.278 --> 01:53:31.214
LIAM: I also, before you touch it, I think we should assume

2889
01:53:31.214 --> 01:53:33.905
that he could get out of that whenever he wants to.

2890
01:53:33.905 --> 01:53:34.738
MARISHA: Yes.

2891
01:53:34.738 --> 01:53:38.155
LIAM: Possibly if touched by someone he likes, like Allura,

2892
01:53:38.155 --> 01:53:41.458
MARISHA: He's either manipulating us, or--

2893
01:53:41.458 --> 01:53:43.475
TALIESIN: Telling the truth, ish.

2894
01:53:43.475 --> 01:53:45.956
LIAM: We assume he's manipulating us,

2895
01:53:45.956 --> 01:53:48.789
and we try our best to be quicker.

2896
01:53:49.882 --> 01:53:52.021
MARISHA: All right, Halas, you there?

2897
01:53:52.021 --> 01:53:53.341
MATT: "Yes, I am."

2898
01:53:53.341 --> 01:53:55.811
MARISHA: Cool, good, good, good.

2899
01:53:55.811 --> 01:53:58.292
All right, here's the dealio.

2900
01:53:58.292 --> 01:53:59.125
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

2901
01:53:59.125 --> 01:54:01.658
MARISHA: We're going to go find our...

2902
01:54:04.858 --> 01:54:07.371
subject of interest.

2903
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:08.616
We're going to complete our mission

2904
01:54:08.616 --> 01:54:11.538
that we were sent in here to do from our benefactor,

2905
01:54:11.538 --> 01:54:14.336
we're going to find this Yussa, and then we're

2906
01:54:14.336 --> 01:54:16.694
all going to get outta here, all right?

2907
01:54:16.694 --> 01:54:18.093
You're going to help us, right?

2908
01:54:18.093 --> 01:54:20.727
LAURA: Ask him how we can carry
his body across all of the stuff.

2909
01:54:20.727 --> 01:54:22.344
SAM: You're strong.

2910
01:54:22.344 --> 01:54:24.910
LAURA: But what if we get attacked?

2911
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:27.351
MATT: "You help me, I help you, that is

2912
01:54:27.351 --> 01:54:29.847
"the arrangement we've made, yes."

2913
01:54:29.847 --> 01:54:32.372
LIAM: For now, William can carry him.

2914
01:54:32.372 --> 01:54:33.469
LAURA: Oh, cool.

2915
01:54:33.469 --> 01:54:35.024
SAM: All right, how do we get out of this room?

2916
01:54:35.024 --> 01:54:36.390
MARISHA: Exactly.

2917
01:54:37.717 --> 01:54:39.570
Let's get outta here and then we'll go from there.

2918
01:54:39.570 --> 01:54:41.394
How do we get out?

2919
01:54:41.394 --> 01:54:46.044
MATT: "I've arranged a Plane Shift circle directly above

2920
01:54:46.044 --> 01:54:50.845
"the laboratory where you probably discovered me."

2921
01:54:50.845 --> 01:54:52.325
MARISHA: Yeah.

2922
01:54:52.325 --> 01:54:55.316
MATT: "That should take you to my study."

2923
01:54:55.316 --> 01:54:56.343
MARISHA: Okay.

2924
01:54:56.343 --> 01:54:57.597
LAURA: Great.

2925
01:54:57.597 --> 01:54:59.831
SAM: We need to step into it.
LIAM: What's great?

2926
01:55:00.745 --> 01:55:05.645
MARISHA: He wants us to go into the Plane Shift circle,

2927
01:55:07.026 --> 01:55:08.785
teleport, whatever, thing.

2928
01:55:08.785 --> 01:55:10.136
MATT: It's a Plane Shift circle.

2929
01:55:10.136 --> 01:55:11.249
LAURA: It's a Plane Shift, that could've

2930
01:55:11.249 --> 01:55:12.952
taken us out of here already?

2931
01:55:12.952 --> 01:55:14.473
MARISHA: That one could've taken us out of here already.

2932
01:55:14.473 --> 01:55:15.900
SAM: Jesus.

2933
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.423
LAURA: We're so stupid!

2934
01:55:17.423 --> 01:55:19.064
MARISHA: Well, we kind of knew that,

2935
01:55:19.064 --> 01:55:20.922
we just didn't know that.
SAM: Or it could have killed us.

2936
01:55:20.922 --> 01:55:21.805
We didn't know.

2937
01:55:21.805 --> 01:55:22.638
LAURA: (groans)

2938
01:55:22.638 --> 01:55:25.566
SAM: So how do we get up there? You want to Polymorph?

2939
01:55:25.566 --> 01:55:28.141
TRAVIS: If that's really the way out and that's his offer,

2940
01:55:28.141 --> 01:55:29.659
we don't have to take him.

2941
01:55:29.659 --> 01:55:31.057
LAURA: Yeah, but we made a contract.

2942
01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:32.168
TRAVIS: Did we?

2943
01:55:32.168 --> 01:55:34.160
LIAM: We also need him to explain how to use it,

2944
01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:38.268
because it just evaporated Frumpkin.

2945
01:55:38.268 --> 01:55:41.884
SAM: He could also be lying and that could just kill us.

2946
01:55:41.884 --> 01:55:44.133
LAURA: Well, what would be the point of that?

2947
01:55:44.133 --> 01:55:45.422
LIAM: Killing us.

2948
01:55:45.422 --> 01:55:47.524
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he wouldn't be able to get out of his gem.

2949
01:55:47.524 --> 01:55:49.317
TALIESIN: That's assuming this is, again--

2950
01:55:49.317 --> 01:55:52.419
LAURA: Yeah, but it evaporated, just, what--

2951
01:55:52.419 --> 01:55:53.826
TRAVIS: Let's treat him like an ally.

2952
01:55:53.826 --> 01:55:54.772
Let's just do it.

2953
01:55:54.772 --> 01:55:56.255
TALIESIN: It's the only way to get through this.

2954
01:55:56.255 --> 01:55:58.085
TRAVIS: Let's just keep talking, let's just keep--

2955
01:55:58.085 --> 01:55:59.460
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you mistrust everything,

2956
01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:00.485
we're never going to move.

2957
01:56:00.485 --> 01:56:02.171
LIAM: Ask him how it works.

2958
01:56:02.171 --> 01:56:04.327
We're not going to just jump into it.

2959
01:56:04.327 --> 01:56:07.110
MARISHA: All right, all right, I'm picking him up.

2960
01:56:07.110 --> 01:56:09.240
All right, Halas.

2961
01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:10.821
MATT: "Yes."

2962
01:56:10.821 --> 01:56:12.507
MARISHA: Here's the thing, we already discovered

2963
01:56:12.507 --> 01:56:14.407
this teleportation sigil.

2964
01:56:14.407 --> 01:56:15.541
MATT: "Oh, wonderful."

2965
01:56:15.541 --> 01:56:18.461
MARISHA: We threw a cat at it, and it looked like

2966
01:56:18.461 --> 01:56:21.284
the cat evaporated.

2967
01:56:21.284 --> 01:56:22.807
MATT: "Well, it vanished, yes?

2968
01:56:22.807 --> 01:56:25.139
"That is the nature of things when they are

2969
01:56:25.139 --> 01:56:27.018
"projected between planes."

2970
01:56:27.018 --> 01:56:28.151
MARISHA: You know, I don't know.

2971
01:56:28.151 --> 01:56:31.934
I've always been the projectee,

2972
01:56:31.934 --> 01:56:33.803
I've never really witnessed anybody doing it--

2973
01:56:33.803 --> 01:56:34.876
MATT: "So now you have.

2974
01:56:34.876 --> 01:56:36.310
"What will happen to the cat will happen to you,

2975
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:38.113
"and you will return in my study."

2976
01:56:38.113 --> 01:56:40.027
MARISHA: Like Mike Teavee?

2977
01:56:40.027 --> 01:56:41.728
Don't worry about it.

2978
01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:44.226
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Too meta.

2979
01:56:44.226 --> 01:56:48.042
MATT: "Whoever this Mike T'Vele is, I certainly hope--"

2980
01:56:48.042 --> 01:56:49.894
TRAVIS: Mike Machiavelli, yes.

2981
01:56:49.894 --> 01:56:52.400
LAURA: Ask him how we get up there.

2982
01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:53.566
MARISHA: Do you have a good recommendation

2983
01:56:53.566 --> 01:56:54.641
for how to get up there?

2984
01:56:54.641 --> 01:56:56.531
Did you just like Reverse Gravity this shit?

2985
01:56:56.531 --> 01:56:57.406
TRAVIS: Reverse Gravity.

2986
01:56:57.406 --> 01:56:59.217
MATT: "Reverse Gravity is one way of doing so,

2987
01:56:59.217 --> 01:57:03.331
"with a Feather Fall, or Fly is a very simple way,

2988
01:57:03.331 --> 01:57:05.100
"that's my usual means of doing so.

2989
01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:07.762
"I don't place such hidden exists readily available

2990
01:57:07.762 --> 01:57:09.215
"for groups that wander into the belly

2991
01:57:09.215 --> 01:57:11.765
"of such a terrible beast.

2992
01:57:11.765 --> 01:57:14.400
"It is but a trifle bit of magic for myself

2993
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.280
"whenever I come to my ritual chambers."

2994
01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:20.567
MARISHA: Man, so you would just take off and fly

2995
01:57:20.567 --> 01:57:22.778
and just shoot through that?

2996
01:57:22.778 --> 01:57:24.150
That's pretty cool.

2997
01:57:24.150 --> 01:57:26.002
That's a cool visual.

2998
01:57:26.002 --> 01:57:27.553
SAM: How are we going to do it?

2999
01:57:27.553 --> 01:57:28.924
Polymorphy?

3000
01:57:28.924 --> 01:57:29.880
Thunder Steppy?

3001
01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:32.098
TRAVIS: DM, question, now that we know where it is

3002
01:57:32.098 --> 01:57:34.434
and how high it is, about how high off of the ground--

3003
01:57:34.434 --> 01:57:35.815
MATT: It's about 100 feet.

3004
01:57:35.815 --> 01:57:37.591
TRAVIS: I can take somebody up there.

3005
01:57:37.591 --> 01:57:39.605
LAURA: I could take somebody up there.

3006
01:57:39.605 --> 01:57:40.961
LIAM: I could take somebody up there.

3007
01:57:40.961 --> 01:57:42.600
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can get ourselves up there.
SAM: I can walk up there.

3008
01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:45.879
TALIESIN: I'll put the body on my back.

3009
01:57:45.879 --> 01:57:47.734
LAURA: What about Willi?

3010
01:57:47.734 --> 01:57:49.784
TALIESIN: Oh, Willi.
LIAM: Well.

3011
01:57:51.127 --> 01:57:53.059
SAM: We can carry him if you Polymorph.

3012
01:57:53.059 --> 01:57:55.346
LAURA: I could Polymorph.
SAM: Or Dimension.

3013
01:57:55.346 --> 01:57:59.010
LIAM: Ask him if he's able to operate the circle

3014
01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:04.010
from within there, or if one of us is supposed to do so.

3015
01:58:04.946 --> 01:58:07.967
MARISHA: So can you activate this beast,

3016
01:58:07.967 --> 01:58:09.875
or are we supposed to do it?

3017
01:58:09.875 --> 01:58:11.391
MATT: "It's permanent, you just touch the middle

3018
01:58:11.391 --> 01:58:13.452
of the circle and it will transition.

3019
01:58:13.452 --> 01:58:14.831
MARISHA: Like the cat, got it.

3020
01:58:14.831 --> 01:58:17.268
Nope, we just touch it.

3021
01:58:17.268 --> 01:58:20.659
LIAM: I take the next 10 minutes to--

3022
01:58:20.659 --> 01:58:22.817
wait, no, that's incorrect,

3023
01:58:22.817 --> 01:58:24.904
I think it's longer.

3024
01:58:24.904 --> 01:58:27.262
I could ask my cat.

3025
01:58:27.262 --> 01:58:29.842
TRAVIS: You could, if it hadn't been (poof).

3026
01:58:29.842 --> 01:58:31.040
SAM: We just need to get up there.

3027
01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:31.873
LAURA: Yeah.

3028
01:58:31.873 --> 01:58:33.501
MARISHA: Yeah, all we need to do is get up there.
LAURA: Yeah.

3029
01:58:33.501 --> 01:58:35.903
I cast Polymorph.

3030
01:58:35.903 --> 01:58:37.317
I cast Polymorph.

3031
01:58:37.317 --> 01:58:38.956
MATT: Okay, into?

3032
01:58:38.956 --> 01:58:40.042
LAURA: Giant eagle.

3033
01:58:40.042 --> 01:58:42.327
MATT: All righty, you can carry a handful of people.

3034
01:58:42.327 --> 01:58:43.760
LAURA: I carry Caduceus and I carry--

3035
01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.228
SAM: Ah-ah-ah.

3036
01:58:45.228 --> 01:58:47.464
We got to carry Willi and the body, too.

3037
01:58:47.464 --> 01:58:48.555
SAM: Okay, I'm not going to go through.

3038
01:58:48.555 --> 01:58:50.296
I'm going to throw you guys, let you guys touch it,

3039
01:58:50.296 --> 01:58:51.379
and then I'm going to come back down.

3040
01:58:51.379 --> 01:58:53.537
SAM: Oh, okay, cool, let's do that.

3041
01:58:53.537 --> 01:58:55.046
MATT: So you take Caduceus and--

3042
01:58:55.046 --> 01:58:56.184
LAURA: Caduceus and Willi.

3043
01:58:56.184 --> 01:58:57.199
MATT: And Willi, all right.

3044
01:58:57.199 --> 01:58:58.954
Make a strength check as a giant eagle

3045
01:58:58.954 --> 01:59:02.213
to carry a solid stone medium-sized golem.

3046
01:59:02.213 --> 01:59:04.247
LAURA: Oh, right, I might have to
just carry Willi by himself.

3047
01:59:04.247 --> 01:59:06.955
MATT: Might be a singular journey.

3048
01:59:09.117 --> 01:59:10.681
TALIESIN: I'll take sleeping beauty.

3049
01:59:10.681 --> 01:59:11.944
LAURA: 12.

3050
01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:13.014
MATT: It takes you a while.

3051
01:59:13.014 --> 01:59:16.073
(wings flapping)

3052
01:59:16.073 --> 01:59:18.021
Better part of maybe three to four minutes

3053
01:59:18.021 --> 01:59:19.613
to get to that height, and you're starting

3054
01:59:19.613 --> 01:59:21.780
to get tired already, and then even then,

3055
01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:25.063
it's less being able to throw more than

3056
01:59:25.063 --> 01:59:28.151
having to lob as an upward movement.

3057
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:33.021
Willi's going to try and, oh, rolled really well.

3058
01:59:33.021 --> 01:59:35.453
Managed to, as part of that motion, spring as well

3059
01:59:35.453 --> 01:59:37.177
and make just enough of an arc,

3060
01:59:37.177 --> 01:59:40.184
otherwise Willi would've fallen
and take a shitton of damage.

3061
01:59:40.184 --> 01:59:42.877
LIAM: He would've broke.
MATT: Just missed.

3062
01:59:42.877 --> 01:59:45.196
LIAM: He's low on HP.
MATT: There you go.

3063
01:59:45.196 --> 01:59:47.415
But then does (whooshing) and atomizes.

3064
01:59:47.415 --> 01:59:48.698
LAURA: Whoa!

3065
01:59:49.546 --> 01:59:52.064
As an eagle, (screeches).

3066
01:59:52.064 --> 01:59:55.578
As I go back down, I grab Caduceus and... Nott?

3067
01:59:55.578 --> 01:59:56.411
SAM: Sure.

3068
01:59:56.411 --> 01:59:58.135
LAURA: I hold out my claw, anybody who wants to come get in.

3069
01:59:58.135 --> 02:00:00.669
TALIESIN: I'll get the sleeping body as well,

3070
02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:02.209
that's in the manacles.
MATT: So you take Halas' body.

3071
02:00:02.209 --> 02:00:03.537
TALIESIN: Yeah, put the manacles around.

3072
02:00:03.537 --> 02:00:05.535
MATT: All right, you fly up.

3073
02:00:05.535 --> 02:00:07.814
MARISHA: All right, look Halas, there you go,

3074
02:00:07.814 --> 02:00:10.162
there goes your body. Can you see it? There it goes.

3075
02:00:10.162 --> 02:00:12.733
MATT: "No, I cannot see outside of the gem."

3076
02:00:12.733 --> 02:00:13.566
MARISHA: Well, it's going.

3077
02:00:13.566 --> 02:00:15.509
LAURA: Fjord, Caleb.
MATT: Caduceus, Nott.

3078
02:00:15.509 --> 02:00:17.378
(whooshes) Atomized.
LAURA: Up and out.

3079
02:00:17.378 --> 02:00:18.942
SAM: Are we dead?

3080
02:00:20.477 --> 02:00:22.657
MATT: Who's next?
LAURA: Fjord and Caleb.

3081
02:00:22.657 --> 02:00:24.770
TRAVIS: Sunset this campaign, let's go.

3082
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:26.441
All right.

3083
02:00:26.441 --> 02:00:27.704
MATT: (whooshing)

3084
02:00:27.704 --> 02:00:32.704
Both of you, upon contact to the symbol, vanish.

3085
02:00:33.115 --> 02:00:36.705
I come back down, I grab Beau.

3086
02:00:36.705 --> 02:00:38.204
MARISHA: All right.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3087
02:00:38.204 --> 02:00:39.125
MARISHA: We're all that's left, right?

3088
02:00:39.125 --> 02:00:40.241
LAURA: (squeaks)

3089
02:00:40.241 --> 02:00:42.349
MARISHA: I squeeze on and...

3090
02:00:42.349 --> 02:00:44.396
LAURA: (whooshing)

3091
02:00:44.396 --> 02:00:47.834
I smoosh Beau up against-- she's just on my back, right?

3092
02:00:47.834 --> 02:00:48.947
MARISHA: (grunts)

3093
02:00:48.947 --> 02:00:52.273
MATT: Beau vanishes, and then you press up against it.

3094
02:00:52.273 --> 02:00:53.388
You vanish as well.

3095
02:00:53.388 --> 02:00:56.091
SAM: Oh no, we forgot Derek.

3096
02:00:56.091 --> 02:00:58.409
No, there's no Derek.

3097
02:00:58.409 --> 02:01:01.080
TALIESIN: He's been erased from our memory.

3098
02:01:02.097 --> 02:01:06.510
MATT: As to what happens after touching that circle,

3099
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:07.785
we'll come back to it after our break.

3100
02:01:07.785 --> 02:01:08.785
TALIESIN: Roll your new character.

3101
02:01:08.785 --> 02:01:09.618
MATT: Yep.

3102
02:01:09.618 --> 02:01:11.453
We'll be back here shortly.

3103
02:01:11.453 --> 02:01:12.385
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Oh man.

3104
02:01:12.385 --> 02:01:13.654
TRAVIS: (machinery whirring)

3105
02:01:13.654 --> 02:01:17.780
LIAM: My palms have been slick this whole time.

3106
02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:19.469
(laughter)

3107
02:01:19.469 --> 02:01:22.163
MATT: In the meantime, we do have, our awesome friends

3108
02:01:22.163 --> 02:01:24.917
at Wyrmwood are giving away the wenge with turquoise inlay

3109
02:01:24.917 --> 02:01:27.014
coffin dice vault, which is available

3110
02:01:27.014 --> 02:01:28.508
through their Kickstarter campaign,

3111
02:01:28.508 --> 02:01:30.859
which ends tonight. If you haven't had a chance to get in,

3112
02:01:30.859 --> 02:01:32.707
tonight's your last chance to do so.

3113
02:01:32.707 --> 02:01:34.375
On Halloween, to win this awesome thing tonight,

3114
02:01:34.375 --> 02:01:37.990
put it in the code word tonight, which is dread, D-R-E-A-D.

3115
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:39.846
Once only in the chat, more than once

3116
02:01:39.846 --> 02:01:42.144
and you'll be disqualified, only folks in the US and Canada

3117
02:01:42.144 --> 02:01:44.144
excluding Quebec because of stupid giveaway laws.

3118
02:01:44.144 --> 02:01:47.275
We'll have a winner for you when we come back.

3119
02:01:47.275 --> 02:01:48.649
(as McCree) Y'all just sit back a minute.

3120
02:01:48.649 --> 02:01:50.458
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3121
02:01:50.458 --> 02:01:51.720

BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

3140
02:02:41.864 --> 02:02:44.314
BRIAN: Are we on the internet?

3141
02:02:44.314 --> 02:02:47.177
(laughter)

3142
02:02:47.177 --> 02:02:48.293
JERRY: I don't know.

3143
02:02:48.293 --> 02:02:49.396
BRIAN: You don't know?

3144
02:02:49.396 --> 02:02:53.220
Jerry, what the fuck are you doing here, man?

3145
02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:56.632
Last week, Dani said if we didn't discuss UnDeadwood,

3146
02:02:56.632 --> 02:02:58.639
she was not going to come back this week,

3147
02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:00.739
and now we have Jerry. He has one job,

3148
02:03:00.739 --> 02:03:02.024
I say, "Are we on the internet?"

3149
02:03:02.024 --> 02:03:03.800
He comes up with something funny.

3150
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:05.976
We told him days ago.

3151
02:03:05.976 --> 02:03:09.213
Try it again, are we on the internet?

3152
02:03:09.213 --> 02:03:10.777
JERRY: Yes, Brian, we're on the internet.

3153
02:03:10.777 --> 02:03:12.179
BRIAN: Hilarious.

3154
02:03:12.179 --> 02:03:13.576
(Sam and Taliesin laughing)

3155
02:03:13.576 --> 02:03:17.124
I'm jumping out of my fucking chair.

3156
02:03:17.124 --> 02:03:19.278
"Was it surprising for Nott and you

3157
02:03:19.278 --> 02:03:23.011
"to be the voice of reason during the Behemoth scene?"

3158
02:03:23.011 --> 02:03:23.853
TALIESIN: Reason?

3159
02:03:23.853 --> 02:03:24.686
BRIAN: I mean.

3160
02:03:24.686 --> 02:03:25.519
TALIESIN: Reason?

3161
02:03:25.519 --> 02:03:26.474
BRIAN: They didn't put it in quotes

3162
02:03:26.474 --> 02:03:28.800
because I think they were in a hurry.

3163
02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:31.521
SAM: Man, there was a lot of flip-flopping going on.

3164
02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:34.540
At one point, I believe everyone in the party

3165
02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.330
except for me and Travis wanted to

3166
02:03:36.330 --> 02:03:40.134
get the hell out of there, and then all of a sudden

3167
02:03:40.134 --> 02:03:44.218
it seemed like I was the only one who did not want--

3168
02:03:44.218 --> 02:03:46.270
no, yeah, so me and Travis wanted to go in,

3169
02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:49.587
and then we flipped, and so I wanted to not go in anymore.

3170
02:03:49.587 --> 02:03:52.509
Because it just, I wanted to, like I just wanted

3171
02:03:52.509 --> 02:03:57.350
to see what was in the room, but then going into the thing

3172
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:59.587
is so, it's such a leap.

3173
02:03:59.587 --> 02:04:02.219
BRIAN: What the fuck?!

3174
02:04:02.219 --> 02:04:03.192
What is that?!

3175
02:04:03.192 --> 02:04:04.994
(laughter)

3176
02:04:04.994 --> 02:04:06.013
SAM: We have a bug?!

3177
02:04:06.013 --> 02:04:07.691
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so happy!

3178
02:04:07.691 --> 02:04:09.128
SAM: We have a bug with Will on it?

3179
02:04:09.128 --> 02:04:11.085
BRIAN: Did Zach leave?

3180
02:04:11.085 --> 02:04:13.785
I did not sign off on that.

3181
02:04:15.245 --> 02:04:18.051
SAM: Have you ever done that on a show before?

3182
02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:20.480
BRIAN: Absol-- I would never have allowed that!

3183
02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.389
The only thing that I would have allowed is me--

3184
02:04:23.389 --> 02:04:24.500
No!

3185
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:27.741
(Sam and Taliesin laughing)

3186
02:04:27.741 --> 02:04:29.666
Unacceptable!

3187
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:33.150
(offended scoffing)

3188
02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:33.983
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

3189
02:04:33.983 --> 02:04:36.076
BRIAN: (offended scoffing)
SAM: How many of those do we have?

3190
02:04:36.076 --> 02:04:37.582
BRIAN: No!
SAM: Do we have more of them?!

3191
02:04:37.582 --> 02:04:39.813
BRIAN: Everyone is fired!

3192
02:04:39.813 --> 02:04:41.315
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3193
02:04:41.315 --> 02:04:44.995
BRIAN: This is literally my worst nightmare.

3194
02:04:44.995 --> 02:04:47.248
SAM: I totally feel you,
I think you made the right decision,

3195
02:04:47.248 --> 02:04:50.268
ultimately, and you know, you don't need ratings,

3196
02:04:50.268 --> 02:04:52.624
so that's fine, you know, you did the show

3197
02:04:52.624 --> 02:04:55.338
for other reasons, and you're not going to get that bump

3198
02:04:55.338 --> 02:04:58.451
that I would bring to the show, but that's okay,

3199
02:04:58.451 --> 02:04:59.534
you can have, you know--
TALIESIN: The Riegel rise?

3200
02:04:59.534 --> 02:05:00.578
SAM: Yeah, the Riegel rise.

3201
02:05:00.578 --> 02:05:01.978
You're not going to get that, but that's okay,

3202
02:05:01.978 --> 02:05:03.323
you have other things.
JERRY: Hey, Brian.

3203
02:05:03.323 --> 02:05:04.840
BRIAN: Yeah.
JERRY: We're 30 minutes in.

3204
02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:06.178
BRIAN: We are 30 minutes in.

3205
02:05:06.178 --> 02:05:08.280
(Sam and Taliesin laughing)

3206
02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:09.672
Thank you, Jerry.

3207
02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:13.448
Thank you for reminding me at what point

3208
02:05:13.448 --> 02:05:16.273
in the show you became useful.

3209
02:05:16.273 --> 02:05:18.410
Jerry, tell them what happened,

3210
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:20.840
campaign two, episode 26, you remember that one?

3211
02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:21.977
SAM: (laughs)

3212
02:05:21.977 --> 02:05:23.715
JERRY: That is a good question.

3213
02:05:23.715 --> 02:05:24.823
BRIAN: It's a great one,

3214
02:05:24.823 --> 02:05:26.023
that's what I do for a fucking living

3215
02:05:26.023 --> 02:05:27.501
is ask good questions.
SAM: You've got a computer

3216
02:05:27.501 --> 02:05:28.482
in front of you, look it up.

3217
02:05:28.482 --> 02:05:29.315
BRIAN: No, don't--

3218
02:05:29.315 --> 02:05:30.571
TALIESIN: That's just a prop, it doesn't actually--

3219
02:05:30.571 --> 02:05:33.457
BRIAN: If you're going to fill in for Dani... (sighs)

3220
02:05:33.457 --> 02:05:36.112
I can say to Dani, "What happened that episode?"

3221
02:05:36.112 --> 02:05:38.189
And Dani will say, "How much time you got?"

3222
02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:39.629
You know, and I'll say, "Five seconds,"

3223
02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:40.810
then she'll tell me in five seconds.

3224
02:05:40.810 --> 02:05:41.868
SAM: She's an expert.

3225
02:05:41.868 --> 02:05:44.580
TALIESIN: She's one of the leading experts
in her field, to be fair.

3226
02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:47.488
BRIAN: "What do you think Obann's
'finish line' might entail?

3227
02:05:47.488 --> 02:05:49.139
"Are either of you worried about not getting back

3228
02:05:49.139 --> 02:05:52.049
"in time to stop him?"

3229
02:05:52.049 --> 02:05:53.680
SAM: I don't know anymore.

3230
02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:54.689
I don't know what he's doing.

3231
02:05:54.689 --> 02:05:58.633
I mean, he's assembling this awesome squad of doom.

3232
02:05:58.633 --> 02:06:00.320
TALIESIN: Which we've hindered.

3233
02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.772
SAM: We have, but he still has other members

3234
02:06:02.772 --> 02:06:04.330
who can cause a lot of damage.

3235
02:06:04.330 --> 02:06:06.225
But like, is he going to attack something?

3236
02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:08.355
Is he going to overthrow someone?

3237
02:06:08.355 --> 02:06:10.206
Is he just causing chaos?

3238
02:06:10.206 --> 02:06:11.999
Like, what is the end goal?

3239
02:06:11.999 --> 02:06:13.298
I don't know.

3240
02:06:13.298 --> 02:06:15.399
This has been something that's
plagued us the entire campaign,

3241
02:06:15.399 --> 02:06:18.237
we just don't know.
TALIESIN: Don't know what he's doing.

3242
02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:21.813
But there's no sense running into it half-cocked,

3243
02:06:21.813 --> 02:06:25.226
I mean, going through this thing and looking for

3244
02:06:25.226 --> 02:06:27.605
anything we can use against him is a good idea.

3245
02:06:27.605 --> 02:06:31.035
This is a big happy fun ball of destruction

3246
02:06:31.035 --> 02:06:33.733
and we might find something that's very useful for--

3247
02:06:33.733 --> 02:06:36.800
that's so weird-- that's, you know,

3248
02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:39.006
so I'm a big fan of not going into battle

3249
02:06:39.006 --> 02:06:40.749
until you feel like you have a fighting chance.

3250
02:06:40.749 --> 02:06:43.386
SAM: I will say this, though, just to Matt's credit.

3251
02:06:43.386 --> 02:06:45.961
It's frustrating sometimes to not know

3252
02:06:45.961 --> 02:06:49.037
the answers to anything in this campaign,

3253
02:06:49.037 --> 02:06:51.737
but it's also, like, it's kind of addictive

3254
02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:54.329
because there's always more to learn.

3255
02:06:54.329 --> 02:06:55.595
BRIAN: Looking for answers, yeah.
HENRY: (barks)

3256
02:06:55.595 --> 02:06:58.178
BRIAN: Oh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. No, it's okay.

3257
02:06:58.178 --> 02:06:59.562
He's going to be done soon.

3258
02:06:59.562 --> 02:07:00.725
He's leaving.

3259
02:07:00.725 --> 02:07:03.032
Our winner for this week was sent in by Kyle Clemens

3260
02:07:03.032 --> 02:07:06.306
@Ban-eb, is that right?

3261
02:07:06.306 --> 02:07:07.364
OFF-SCREEN: Baneb1ade.

3262
02:07:07.364 --> 02:07:09.522
BRIAN: Baneb1ade, oh, there's spaces.

3263
02:07:09.522 --> 02:07:10.522
Cool.

3264
02:07:10.522 --> 02:07:12.331
Great job, whoever's job that is.

3265
02:07:12.331 --> 02:07:13.918
Max.

3266
02:07:13.918 --> 02:07:17.380
On Instagram and Twitter, photo by @afflictionphotos,

3267
02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:18.880
let's take a look.

3268
02:07:19.966 --> 02:07:22.296
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!
SAM: Oh!

3269
02:07:22.296 --> 02:07:24.183
This was Manleth, yeah.

3270
02:07:24.183 --> 02:07:26.706
TALIESIN: Yeah, we were appreciating this earlier.

3271
02:07:26.706 --> 02:07:29.101
SAM: Is that real fire on his hand?

3272
02:07:29.101 --> 02:07:30.256
BRIAN: Marisha, you saw this, right?

3273
02:07:30.256 --> 02:07:31.300
TALIESIN: It looks like real fire.

3274
02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:33.320
BRIAN: Oh, she loves him so much.

3275
02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:36.605
SAM: It's so great, the hair, the beard color, amazing.

3276
02:07:36.605 --> 02:07:38.426
TALIESIN: There's a whole set of these, if I recall,

3277
02:07:38.426 --> 02:07:39.663
we were looking at.
SAM: The staff is great.

3278
02:07:39.663 --> 02:07:41.582
BRIAN: I bet that's his real beard color.

3279
02:07:41.582 --> 02:07:42.650
SAM: Is someone calling?

3280
02:07:42.650 --> 02:07:47.203
BRIAN: Yeah, it's a FaceTime, and it's Arsequeef.

3281
02:07:47.203 --> 02:07:48.228
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh!

3282
02:07:48.228 --> 02:07:52.535
BRIAN: Are you upset because
your picture isn't on the skull,

3283
02:07:52.535 --> 02:07:54.957
we had to move it for the decorations?

3284
02:07:54.957 --> 02:07:56.422
ARSEQUEEF: That's exactly why I called in.

3285
02:07:56.422 --> 02:07:57.574
BRIAN: That's exa-- (sighs)

3286
02:07:57.574 --> 02:08:02.072
I'm super sorry, that was actually a Max thing, and--

3287
02:08:02.072 --> 02:08:03.903
ARSEQUEEF: Sure it wasn't a Jerry thing?

3288
02:08:03.903 --> 02:08:06.543
BRIAN: Jerry, was that it?
Did you move the picture of Arsequeef?

3289
02:08:06.543 --> 02:08:08.062
JERRY: No, that was Max.

3290
02:08:08.062 --> 02:08:09.527
BRIAN: Where is it, guys?

3291
02:08:09.527 --> 02:08:11.781
It's not anywhere around me.

3292
02:08:11.781 --> 02:08:13.090
ARSEQUEEF: Sam, stop doing that.

3293
02:08:13.090 --> 02:08:15.369
(laughter)

3294
02:08:15.369 --> 02:08:16.710
BRIAN: He said stop doing that.

3295
02:08:16.710 --> 02:08:18.626
I don't even see it anywhere around me.

3296
02:08:18.626 --> 02:08:20.300
TALIESIN: Maybe if we find it, we'll like--

3297
02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:23.509
BRIAN: We're trying to find it, man, I am so sorry.

3298
02:08:23.509 --> 02:08:25.386
ARSEQUEEF: I also have a very special
announcement for you, Brian.

3299
02:08:25.386 --> 02:08:26.710
BRIAN: What is it?

3300
02:08:26.710 --> 02:08:28.714
ARSEQUEEF: It's that Mini Primetime with Will Friedle is--

3301
02:08:28.714 --> 02:08:32.114
(laughter)

3302
02:08:34.521 --> 02:08:36.908
SAM: He does better ad reads than you!

3303
02:08:36.908 --> 02:08:38.222
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

3304
02:08:38.222 --> 02:08:39.971
BRIAN: Who put him--

3305
02:08:39.971 --> 02:08:41.601
No!

3306
02:08:41.601 --> 02:08:43.854
Goddamn it!

3307
02:08:43.854 --> 02:08:45.626
Watch what you've done.

3308
02:08:45.626 --> 02:08:46.676
Look at this.

3309
02:08:46.676 --> 02:08:49.137
No, get him out of here.

3310
02:08:49.137 --> 02:08:50.696
Get him out of here.

3311
02:08:51.971 --> 02:08:54.968
WILL: Hey everyone, the insanely talented Will Friedle here.

3312
02:08:54.968 --> 02:08:56.106
I'm excited to announce that I have

3313
02:08:56.106 --> 02:08:57.427
a new late night talk show coming

3314
02:08:57.427 --> 02:09:00.026
to the Critical Role YouTube channel on Wednesdays

3315
02:09:00.026 --> 02:09:01.811
called Mini Primetime.

3316
02:09:01.811 --> 02:09:04.672
It's brought to you by the same creators as that one show

3317
02:09:04.672 --> 02:09:07.793
with the hippie kid with the bracelets, whatever that is.

3318
02:09:07.793 --> 02:09:10.209
Anyway, my show, Mini Primetime,

3319
02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:12.917
is a mini painting show for beginners and veterans alike

3320
02:09:12.917 --> 02:09:15.486
where this handsome face teaches the Critical Role cast

3321
02:09:15.486 --> 02:09:17.453
how to paint their own Mighty Nein minis.

3322
02:09:17.453 --> 02:09:19.564
We're going to be focusing on specific techniques

3323
02:09:19.564 --> 02:09:21.623
like fades, small detail work,

3324
02:09:21.623 --> 02:09:22.999
and taking your mini to the next level

3325
02:09:22.999 --> 02:09:24.294
by adding to your base.

3326
02:09:24.294 --> 02:09:27.689
So look for it soon on Critical Role's YouTube.

3327
02:09:27.689 --> 02:09:30.892
Critical Role, what is that, what is even a Critical Role?

3328
02:09:30.892 --> 02:09:34.725
Oh, that's right, that was the show with Kash.

3329
02:09:44.348 --> 02:09:47.348
(upbeat jazz music)

3330
02:10:00.431 --> 02:10:03.253
TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

3331
02:10:03.253 --> 02:10:05.828
BRITTANY: "Ooh!"

3332
02:10:07.217 --> 02:10:08.095
BRIAN: What?

3333
02:10:08.095 --> 02:10:09.516
Oh no, it's already happening, dude.

3334
02:10:09.516 --> 02:10:10.349
TRAVIS: Oh god.

3335
02:10:10.349 --> 02:10:11.607
BRITTANY: "Woo!

3336
02:10:11.607 --> 02:10:13.736
"Ooh!"

3337
02:10:13.736 --> 02:10:14.569
BRIAN: What?

3338
02:10:14.569 --> 02:10:17.398
BRITTANY: "Is there anyone there?

3339
02:10:17.398 --> 02:10:19.440
"Ooh!"

3340
02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.564
TRAVIS: Don't make contact!

3341
02:10:20.564 --> 02:10:22.461
BRIAN: Hey, hey, hey ghost, are you lost?

3342
02:10:22.461 --> 02:10:23.409
TRAVIS: Don't open yourself up!

3343
02:10:23.409 --> 02:10:25.557
BRIAN: Are you lost, can we help you?

3344
02:10:25.557 --> 02:10:29.958
BRITTANY: "Which one of God's
forgotten stepchildren speaks to me?

3345
02:10:29.958 --> 02:10:31.786
"Ooh!"

3346
02:10:31.786 --> 02:10:33.343
TRAVIS: You're getting shit from beyond the grave.

3347
02:10:33.343 --> 02:10:35.082
BRIAN: I can't think, nowhere's safe.

3348
02:10:35.082 --> 02:10:36.646
My name is Brian.

3349
02:10:36.646 --> 02:10:38.292
Where are you trying to go?

3350
02:10:38.292 --> 02:10:40.075
BRITTANY: "That voice.

3351
02:10:40.075 --> 02:10:41.908
"It sounds so familiar.

3352
02:10:42.951 --> 02:10:47.499
"I feel as if I heard it a long time ago."

3353
02:10:47.499 --> 02:10:48.911
BRIAN: Wait a second.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3354
02:10:48.911 --> 02:10:51.120
BRIAN: Travis, that voice sounds familiar to me.

3355
02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:53.473
There's no way in hell that's T.N.--

3356
02:10:53.473 --> 02:10:55.173
TRAVIS: I feel like I recognized the--

3357
02:10:55.173 --> 02:10:57.631
BRITTANY: "Oh, that's right, you cringe wizard!"

3358
02:10:57.631 --> 02:10:58.580
(Brian and Travis laughing)

3359
02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:01.072
"It's me, T. N. Tina!

3360
02:11:01.965 --> 02:11:06.446
"And I'm a fucking g-g-ghost!"

3361
02:11:06.446 --> 02:11:08.865
BRIAN: Fuck, Tina!

3362
02:11:08.865 --> 02:11:09.698
TRAVIS: Amazing!

3363
02:11:09.698 --> 02:11:11.320
BRIAN: Tina's back!

3364
02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:12.393
Awesome!

3365
02:11:12.393 --> 02:11:14.974
BRITTANY: "Yeah, thanks a lot, you little bitches!"

3366
02:11:14.974 --> 02:11:16.046
(Travis and Brian laughing)

3367
02:11:16.046 --> 02:11:18.501
"You both didn't do anything to stop me

3368
02:11:18.501 --> 02:11:20.409
"from getting my head ripped off."

3369
02:11:20.409 --> 02:11:21.434
TRAVIS: We really didn't.
BRIAN: Oops.

3370
02:11:21.434 --> 02:11:26.382
BRITTANY: "I'd expect that from you,
you cowardly waste of unlimited atoms!"

3371
02:11:26.382 --> 02:11:27.448
BRIAN: Oh!

3372
02:11:27.448 --> 02:11:29.991
Well, what have you been up to since you

3373
02:11:29.991 --> 02:11:31.989
went into the clouds?

3374
02:11:31.989 --> 02:11:35.543
BRITTANY: "Well, after I got my fucking head ripped off,

3375
02:11:35.543 --> 02:11:40.543
"I saw a bright light at the end of a long tunnel.

3376
02:11:41.168 --> 02:11:45.352
"I felt my body being pulled, and I began to barrel

3377
02:11:45.352 --> 02:11:49.250
"towards the light, faster and faster,

3378
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:54.250
"until a huge green aura wiped across my eyes.

3379
02:11:54.401 --> 02:11:57.067
"I had then reached it."

3380
02:11:57.924 --> 02:11:59.725
BRIAN: Reached it?

3381
02:11:59.725 --> 02:12:03.182
Reached what?
BRITTANY: "The Gates of Diemore."

3382
02:12:03.182 --> 02:12:06.238
BRIAN: That's the place Redbirb mentioned

3383
02:12:06.238 --> 02:12:09.382
back at that shitty-ass jungle.

3384
02:12:09.382 --> 02:12:11.518
What's the Diemore again, Tina?

3385
02:12:11.518 --> 02:12:16.065
BRITTANY: "The Diemore is the holy plane
that all critters go to

3386
02:12:16.065 --> 02:12:19.568
"when their souls have been released by the Ove."

3387
02:12:19.568 --> 02:12:20.991
BRIAN: Who is Ove?

3388
02:12:20.991 --> 02:12:23.216
BRITTANY: "Ugh! You really don't know shit."

3389
02:12:23.216 --> 02:12:25.657
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3390
02:12:25.657 --> 02:12:28.655
BRITTANY: "Ove is the 12th and final maker."

3391
02:12:28.655 --> 02:12:29.488
BRIAN: What?

3392
02:12:29.488 --> 02:12:31.463
BRITTANY: "Now go play the spooky game,

3393
02:12:31.463 --> 02:12:36.298
"and don't forget the prophecy!"

3394
02:12:36.298 --> 02:12:38.316
TRAVIS: Oh Tina, Tina, don't leave us!

3395
02:12:38.316 --> 02:12:40.824
Tina, don't leave us!

3396
02:12:40.824 --> 02:12:41.677
(cries)

3397
02:12:41.677 --> 02:12:43.599
TRAVIS: What's that?

3398
02:12:43.599 --> 02:12:44.790
It's a mountain.

3399
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:48.257
BRIAN: I'm sweating like Sam when he
gets a letter from the IRS.

3400
02:12:49.762 --> 02:12:50.645
TRAVIS: Oh god.

3401
02:12:50.645 --> 02:12:52.454
BRIAN: Get in there.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3402
02:12:52.454 --> 02:12:53.751
I'm going in.

3403
02:12:53.751 --> 02:12:55.026
Oh god!

3404
02:12:55.026 --> 02:12:56.105
BRIAN: Record it, record it!

3405
02:12:56.105 --> 02:12:56.938
TRAVIS: I'm recording!

3406
02:12:56.938 --> 02:12:58.023
Night vision!
BRIAN: Night vision!

3407
02:12:58.023 --> 02:13:01.449
Oh no, dude, if we have to do this through night vision,

3408
02:13:01.449 --> 02:13:02.968
I'm not doing it.

3409
02:13:02.968 --> 02:13:05.140
I thought maybe like a flashlight, but that shit is,

3410
02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:06.761
I don't think so, dude.
TRAVIS: Keep your back to the wall.

3411
02:13:06.761 --> 02:13:07.953
BRIAN: Something's shiny on the table.

3412
02:13:07.953 --> 02:13:09.901
TRAVIS: What are you talking about!
BRIAN: Something shiny on the table.

3413
02:13:09.901 --> 02:13:10.774
Touch it, touch it.

3414
02:13:10.774 --> 02:13:12.150
TRAVIS: It's a confidential file, here we go.

3415
02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:13.500
This is not so bad.

3416
02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:14.605
We're fine.

3417
02:13:14.605 --> 02:13:16.019
I don't even want to read it. I don't care.

3418
02:13:16.019 --> 02:13:18.894
BRIAN: It might tell us more--
TRAVIS: I don't need context,

3419
02:13:18.894 --> 02:13:20.922
I need to survive.

3420
02:13:20.922 --> 02:13:22.251
That's locked.

3421
02:13:22.251 --> 02:13:24.312
I'll try the blocked door.

3422
02:13:24.312 --> 02:13:26.527
BRIAN: That's where the dude was, man.

3423
02:13:27.827 --> 02:13:29.136
(screaming)

3424
02:13:29.136 --> 02:13:30.515
TRAVIS: Fucking shit!

3425
02:13:30.515 --> 02:13:31.837
BRIAN: I knew it!

3426
02:13:31.837 --> 02:13:32.921
Fuck!

3427
02:13:32.921 --> 02:13:35.996
I knew it. God dammit, Max.

3428
02:13:35.996 --> 02:13:39.476
I've mastered the art of candy corn chucking.

3429
02:13:39.476 --> 02:13:40.309
Battery.

3430
02:13:40.309 --> 02:13:42.008
TRAVIS: I know, I see it.

3431
02:13:44.051 --> 02:13:45.992
BRIAN: Wow, Jerry.

3432
02:13:45.992 --> 02:13:47.648
I'm on fire.

3433
02:13:47.648 --> 02:13:48.734
V.O.: Little pig!

3434
02:13:48.734 --> 02:13:49.724
(dramatic music)

3435
02:13:49.724 --> 02:13:50.615
BRIAN: No!

3436
02:13:50.615 --> 02:13:52.901
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that!?

3437
02:13:52.901 --> 02:13:54.507
BRIAN: Oh, I'm going to choke on shit.

3438
02:13:54.507 --> 02:13:55.627
Fuck that.

3439
02:13:55.627 --> 02:13:57.053
TRAVIS: Everything's wrong, okay?

3440
02:13:57.053 --> 02:13:59.143
BRIAN: So something bad definitely happened.

3441
02:13:59.143 --> 02:14:03.510
The military was brought in, they were taken over by the...

3442
02:14:07.269 --> 02:14:08.738
(laughter)

3443
02:14:08.738 --> 02:14:10.549
TRAVIS: I will fight-- Jerry, I will jump off the couch.

3444
02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:12.107
BRIAN: If you guys are fucking actually planning

3445
02:14:12.107 --> 02:14:15.733
to make shit in real life fall on my fucking face,

3446
02:14:15.733 --> 02:14:18.503
I'm going to kill someone, and then you're fired

3447
02:14:18.503 --> 02:14:19.511
after you're dead.
TRAVIS: Jerry, you better claim

3448
02:14:19.511 --> 02:14:20.344
that that was you,

3449
02:14:20.344 --> 02:14:21.971
because if it's some spiritual shit,

3450
02:14:21.971 --> 02:14:25.235
I will bamf out of this realm so fast.

3451
02:14:25.235 --> 02:14:27.083
BRIAN: What just fell down?
TRAVIS: Don't fuck around!

3452
02:14:27.083 --> 02:14:29.089
BRIAN: I'm just looking to see what fell over, dude,

3453
02:14:29.089 --> 02:14:31.251
I'm fucking terrified.

3454
02:14:32.101 --> 02:14:33.871
TRAVIS: What is happening right now?

3455
02:14:33.871 --> 02:14:35.541
BRIAN: They're watching the Game of Thrones finale.

3456
02:14:35.541 --> 02:14:37.471
This guy's like, are you fucking serious?

3457
02:14:37.471 --> 02:14:39.141
TRAVIS: I feel like we're in Sleep No More.

3458
02:14:39.141 --> 02:14:42.929
BRIAN: This guy's like, I lost half my face for this?

3459
02:14:42.929 --> 02:14:45.519
The other guy's like, I can't look, man.

3460
02:14:45.519 --> 02:14:48.647
TRAVIS: All right guys, it's been real, appreciate ya.

3461
02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:49.793
BRIAN: TV's on the fuzz.

3462
02:14:49.793 --> 02:14:52.534
TRAVIS: Just enjoy our programming.

3463
02:14:53.818 --> 02:14:54.651
Keep it--

3464
02:14:54.651 --> 02:14:56.433
(screaming)
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

3465
02:14:56.433 --> 02:14:58.311
V.O.: Get them out, please!

3466
02:14:58.311 --> 02:14:59.672
The doctor is dead!

3467
02:14:59.672 --> 02:15:00.576
Rip them clean!

3468
02:15:00.576 --> 02:15:02.322
You have to help me!

3469
02:15:02.322 --> 02:15:04.572
(laughter)

3470
02:15:05.638 --> 02:15:07.338
BRIAN: You son of a bitch!

3471
02:15:07.338 --> 02:15:09.728
TRAVIS: Oh god, I keep thinking I see things.
BRIAN: I don't like this one bit.

3472
02:15:09.728 --> 02:15:10.677
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good, we're good.

3473
02:15:10.677 --> 02:15:11.677
BRIAN: The fact that...

3474
02:15:11.677 --> 02:15:13.813
(suspenseful music)

3475
02:15:13.813 --> 02:15:14.646
BRIAN: Run. Run!

3476
02:15:14.646 --> 02:15:15.829
TRAVIS: What do you mean run?

3477
02:15:15.829 --> 02:15:17.271
(shouting)

3478
02:15:17.271 --> 02:15:19.038
TRAVIS: Get the fucking light on!

3479
02:15:19.038 --> 02:15:20.968
(shouting)

3480
02:15:20.968 --> 02:15:22.303
TRAVIS: Do I need to head under the bed?

3481
02:15:22.303 --> 02:15:23.253
What do I do!?

3482
02:15:23.253 --> 02:15:24.121
BRIAN: Back under the bed?

3483
02:15:24.121 --> 02:15:25.080
I don't know, man.

3484
02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:25.924
(shouting)

3485
02:15:25.924 --> 02:15:26.996
TRAVIS: He's fucking fast!

3486
02:15:26.996 --> 02:15:28.213
He's faster than shit!

3487
02:15:28.213 --> 02:15:30.262
BRIAN: I don't know, man, where else can we go?

3488
02:15:30.262 --> 02:15:31.697
Go back, go back.

3489
02:15:31.697 --> 02:15:32.956
TRAVIS: I'm going to the bed.
BRIAN: Fuck.

3490
02:15:32.956 --> 02:15:35.218
TRAVIS: I'm going under the bed.

3491
02:15:35.218 --> 02:15:36.618
(suspenseful music)

3492
02:15:37.516 --> 02:15:39.168
(shouting)

3493
02:15:39.168 --> 02:15:40.093
BRIAN: Reload the batteries!

3494
02:15:40.093 --> 02:15:41.911
TRAVIS: I'm trying!

3495
02:15:41.911 --> 02:15:44.211
(suspenseful music)

3496
02:15:44.211 --> 02:15:47.697
(gentle electronic music)

3497
02:16:12.084 --> 02:16:15.309
(dramatic Western music)

3498
02:16:15.309 --> 02:16:20.309
TRAVIS: Our father, we gather here as strangers,

3499
02:16:20.469 --> 02:16:25.378
brought together by gold, now bound by fate and fear.

3500
02:16:26.224 --> 02:16:31.224
We remain steadfast in our bodies and in our minds.

3501
02:16:31.468 --> 02:16:36.468
But this evil we face now meets us ill-prepared.

3502
02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.715
For guidance, we ask you now.

3503
02:16:40.715 --> 02:16:44.134
For... protection.

3504
02:16:44.134 --> 02:16:49.134
Not just for our lives, but for our very souls.

3505
02:16:49.614 --> 02:16:53.880
Be our light as we enter

3506
02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:55.613
the darkness.

3507
02:17:19.118 --> 02:17:22.743
(mysterious music)

3508
02:17:45.661 --> 02:17:48.828
(slow dramatic music)

3509
02:18:16.019 --> 02:18:19.019
(suspenseful music)

3510
02:18:21.673 --> 02:18:23.117
DANI: (sighs)

3511
02:18:23.117 --> 02:18:26.064
I just want to watch my Critical Role!

3512
02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:27.360
(mysterious music)

3513
02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:30.443
TALIESIN: For your consideration,
this is the face of a Critter

3514
02:18:30.443 --> 02:18:33.232
who's craving their Critical Role content.

3515
02:18:33.232 --> 02:18:35.276
But for this sanctimonious shipper,

3516
02:18:35.276 --> 02:18:38.164
time misled them like a trip to the Feywild.

3517
02:18:38.164 --> 02:18:41.427
They now have come face to face with existential dread,

3518
02:18:41.427 --> 02:18:44.567
a fear of sardonic spoilers.

3519
02:18:44.567 --> 02:18:46.745
Let us lead them across the bridge into a realm

3520
02:18:46.745 --> 02:18:50.209
of bright shadows where, even if one misses the live viewing

3521
02:18:50.209 --> 02:18:53.845
of their favorite program, they can still watch it on demand

3522
02:18:53.845 --> 02:18:56.020
if they bear the mark of a Twitch subscription

3523
02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:57.440
to the channel.

3524
02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.269
That mark, a mysterious sigil of emoticons

3525
02:19:00.269 --> 02:19:03.855
made by the sage, Arsequeef.

3526
02:19:03.855 --> 02:19:05.784
In this land of shadow known as

3527
02:19:05.784 --> 02:19:08.513
the Twitch Subscription Zone, no shipper,

3528
02:19:08.513 --> 02:19:11.134
fan ficcer, or please name my kitten litter Critter

3529
02:19:11.134 --> 02:19:14.056
has to feel like a bitter fritter.

3530
02:19:14.056 --> 02:19:17.280
And so ends another meandering digression,

3531
02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:20.491
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

3532
02:19:20.491 --> 02:19:22.241
to the region we call

3533
02:19:24.595 --> 02:19:27.265
the Twitch Subscription Zone.

(suspenseful music)

3539
02:19:43.495 --> 02:19:47.745
You should check to see if you've left the oven on.

3540
02:19:49.695 --> 02:19:52.445
(dramatic orchestral music)

3541
02:32:40.128 --> 02:32:41.591
MATT: And welcome back.

3542
02:32:41.591 --> 02:32:43.505
So before we get back into the game,

3543
02:32:43.505 --> 02:32:46.066
we do have our winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway.

3544
02:32:46.066 --> 02:32:48.652
It is Notfishhh.

3545
02:32:48.652 --> 02:32:49.766
(laughter)

3546
02:32:49.766 --> 02:32:50.618
TALIESIN: Big fan.

3547
02:32:50.618 --> 02:32:53.322
MATT: Notfishhh, congratulations, and we'll have that

3548
02:32:53.322 --> 02:32:55.038
sent to you ASAP.

3549
02:32:55.038 --> 02:32:56.492
TRAVIS: Is it N-O-T-T-fish?

3550
02:32:56.492 --> 02:33:00.118
MATT: N-O-T-F-I-S-H...-H...-H.

3551
02:33:00.118 --> 02:33:01.961
(laughter)

3552
02:33:01.961 --> 02:33:03.244
Notfishhh.

3553
02:33:03.244 --> 02:33:05.063
LIAM: Is that your secret handle, Taliesin?

3554
02:33:05.063 --> 02:33:06.519
TALIESIN: Notfishhh.

3555
02:33:06.519 --> 02:33:10.366
LIAM: Notfishhh, not fish, no, no, not fish.

3556
02:33:10.366 --> 02:33:12.033
MATT: All righty, folks.

3557
02:33:14.398 --> 02:33:18.231
Let's go ahead and jump in to where we last left off.

3558
02:33:18.231 --> 02:33:19.064
LIAM: Vaporized.

3559
02:33:19.064 --> 02:33:20.283
MATT: Get the music going there.

3560
02:33:20.283 --> 02:33:21.316
SAM: (gasps)
LAURA: Vaporized.

3561
02:33:21.316 --> 02:33:23.116
MATT: So.
TRAVIS: Your hair is doing something.

3562
02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:25.711
SAM: It's not regulation.

3563
02:33:25.711 --> 02:33:26.730
TRAVIS: That's the point.

3564
02:33:26.730 --> 02:33:28.368
LIAM: It's a bird's nest.
MARISHA: It's like you killed a porcupine.

3565
02:33:28.368 --> 02:33:29.407
MATT: It's terrifying.

3566
02:33:29.407 --> 02:33:31.491
(laughter)

3567
02:33:31.491 --> 02:33:35.364
SAM: I have to thank Tara Strong for getting me this wig.

3568
02:33:35.364 --> 02:33:37.017
TRAVIS: Why are you thanking her for that?

3569
02:33:37.017 --> 02:33:39.267
(laughter)

3570
02:33:42.969 --> 02:33:47.002
MATT: One by one, you apparate

3571
02:33:47.002 --> 02:33:49.044
in a darkened space,

3572
02:33:49.044 --> 02:33:50.621
strangely familiar.

3573
02:33:53.933 --> 02:33:57.617
You are now standing within a hexagonal chamber

3574
02:33:57.617 --> 02:34:01.546
sitting at a heavy angle to the left,

3575
02:34:01.546 --> 02:34:04.426
it appears to be some form of a study,

3576
02:34:04.426 --> 02:34:07.285
a place you've already been before.

3577
02:34:07.285 --> 02:34:10.509
You can see a desk, furniture, bookcases and shelves,

3578
02:34:10.509 --> 02:34:13.766
but it's all been tossed a bit.

3579
02:34:13.766 --> 02:34:18.104
You can see the portrait of Halas up on the wall.

3580
02:34:18.104 --> 02:34:22.262
You can see the bookcases themselves,

3581
02:34:22.262 --> 02:34:25.825
previously passed by, that were locked,

3582
02:34:25.825 --> 02:34:29.298
and the large stained glass window

3583
02:34:29.298 --> 02:34:33.203
that shows all the different planes, inner and outer,

3584
02:34:33.203 --> 02:34:36.431
where you had previously pressed a red object

3585
02:34:36.431 --> 02:34:41.431
and were tossed into one of the other chambers before.

3586
02:34:41.702 --> 02:34:46.702
Now, much of the furniture has been set on its side,

3587
02:34:47.076 --> 02:34:49.684
rolled and emptied. You can see the carpet

3588
02:34:49.684 --> 02:34:51.596
has been set slightly askew that was previously

3589
02:34:51.596 --> 02:34:55.187
in the center of the chamber, as well as broken pieces

3590
02:34:55.187 --> 02:34:58.134
of a mage hunter golem,

3591
02:34:58.134 --> 02:35:00.704
similar to the one that you had previously fought,

3592
02:35:00.704 --> 02:35:03.947
now scattered and left amongst the bits

3593
02:35:03.947 --> 02:35:06.849
of toppled furniture.

3594
02:35:06.849 --> 02:35:07.682
MARISHA: We didn't do that.

3595
02:35:07.682 --> 02:35:10.024
TRAVIS: No, maybe Yussa did it.

3596
02:35:10.024 --> 02:35:13.519
MATT: The chamber has no visible exit, aside from

3597
02:35:13.519 --> 02:35:16.127
the doorway you entered, which was strangely

3598
02:35:16.127 --> 02:35:19.277
the same doorway you entered the first time,

3599
02:35:19.277 --> 02:35:22.777
though the means of arriving is different.

3600
02:35:23.728 --> 02:35:27.019
LIAM: I reach out to my cat with
my mind for him to come to me.

3601
02:35:27.019 --> 02:35:28.419
MATT: (meows)

3602
02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:29.926
Frumpkin comes around the corner

3603
02:35:29.926 --> 02:35:31.729
and looks over towards you.

3604
02:35:31.729 --> 02:35:33.726
LIAM: Told you I'd come back around.

3605
02:35:36.035 --> 02:35:40.343
SAM: According to the map, there are several exits here

3606
02:35:40.343 --> 02:35:42.569
to go to other rooms.

3607
02:35:42.569 --> 02:35:43.966
TALIESIN: We know where we need to go.

3608
02:35:43.966 --> 02:35:45.190
LAURA: The Prison of Soot.

3609
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:47.805
SAM: Wait, we've got a guy who can tell us where to go.
LAURA: Yeah, we just ask him which one to take.

3610
02:35:47.805 --> 02:35:48.748
TALIESIN: We're going to--

3611
02:35:48.748 --> 02:35:49.581
MARISHA: Are we sure that we think

3612
02:35:49.581 --> 02:35:51.258
Yussa would be in the prison?

3613
02:35:51.258 --> 02:35:54.598
LAURA: Yeah, the Traveler told me that Yussa was there.

3614
02:35:54.598 --> 02:35:55.681
MARISHA: What'd you say?

3615
02:35:55.681 --> 02:35:57.147
TRAVIS: We sure this is Halas?

3616
02:35:57.147 --> 02:35:58.904
SAM: He hasn't been seen from in a long time,

3617
02:35:58.904 --> 02:36:00.345
he knows the way out. I mean,

3618
02:36:00.345 --> 02:36:02.087
who else could it be?
LAURA: I think it's him.

3619
02:36:02.975 --> 02:36:04.679
TALIESIN: And he did know how to get out,

3620
02:36:04.679 --> 02:36:07.941
and made sense with what we found.

3621
02:36:07.941 --> 02:36:10.163
LIAM: Also doesn't change how we work with him.

3622
02:36:10.163 --> 02:36:12.427
LAURA: Ask him how to get Yussa out of the Prison of Soot.

3623
02:36:12.427 --> 02:36:14.883
SAM: Ask him how to change my body permanently.

3624
02:36:15.966 --> 02:36:17.074
MARISHA: In time.

3625
02:36:17.074 --> 02:36:18.899
We'll get there, right?

3626
02:36:18.899 --> 02:36:22.835
Isn't that like a-- hey, Halas.

3627
02:36:22.835 --> 02:36:24.516
You there?
MATT: "Yes.

3628
02:36:24.516 --> 02:36:25.897
"I'm not going anywhere."

3629
02:36:25.897 --> 02:36:26.980
MARISHA: Good, good.

3630
02:36:28.555 --> 02:36:33.353
So we think that the person that we're looking for

3631
02:36:33.353 --> 02:36:35.520
is in your Prison of Soot.

3632
02:36:36.418 --> 02:36:37.536
MATT: "Ah.

3633
02:36:37.536 --> 02:36:39.772
"That makes sense. That's where the mage golems

3634
02:36:39.772 --> 02:36:44.522
"are supposed to take them once they've been subjugated."

3635
02:36:45.708 --> 02:36:48.321
LAURA: How do we get-- we didn't hear that part.

3636
02:36:48.321 --> 02:36:49.333
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.
LAURA: Sorry.

3637
02:36:49.333 --> 02:36:50.580
SAM: Thank you for relaying that, Beau.

3638
02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:52.603
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

3639
02:36:52.603 --> 02:36:54.666
LAURA: How do we get him out?

3640
02:36:54.666 --> 02:36:56.181
MARISHA: All right, how do we going to him out,

3641
02:36:56.181 --> 02:36:59.949
and how do we not get caught by your mage golems?

3642
02:36:59.949 --> 02:37:03.506
MATT: "I would say perhaps being careful not to

3643
02:37:03.506 --> 02:37:05.606
"expend spells

3644
02:37:05.606 --> 02:37:09.880
"of a particular level or higher.

3645
02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:12.551
"The power tends to draw them and activate them

3646
02:37:12.551 --> 02:37:14.880
"to hunt you from chamber to chamber.

3647
02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:18.775
"And there are multiple throughout my homes.

02:37:18.775 --> 02:37:21.300
"But the prison has many.

3649
02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:25.662
"The prison is a series of chambers, tower-like,

3650
02:37:25.662 --> 02:37:27.483
"but at an angle.

3651
02:37:27.483 --> 02:37:31.693
"Usually take no more than two captives per layer,

"once they have been absolved of their objects

3653
02:37:36.124 --> 02:37:39.185
"and means of escape.

3654
02:37:39.185 --> 02:37:41.779
"It is called the Prison of Soot for a reason."

3655
02:37:42.762 --> 02:37:44.000
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3656
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:47.067
MATT: "There is a type of dust that hangs in the air.

3657
02:37:48.009 --> 02:37:49.757
"I would not recommend speaking out loud

3658

02:37:55.983 --> 02:37:58.153
TRAVIS: Right, sure.

3662
02:37:58.153 --> 02:37:59.948
TALIESIN: This is very useful.

3663
02:37:59.948 --> 02:38:04.631
MARISHA: What does it do when it

3664
02:38:04.631 --> 02:38:05.606
is in contact

3665
02:38:05.606 --> 02:38:07.380
with one's vocal cords?

3666
02:38:07.380 --> 02:38:10.503
MATT: "Paralyzes them for a day or two."

3667
02:38:11.478 --> 02:38:12.945
TRAVIS: Big punishment, big punishment.

3668
02:38:12.945 --> 02:38:14.925
There was soot in his pocket.

3669
02:38:14.925 --> 02:38:17.170
Can he tell us what that was?

3670
02:38:17.170 --> 02:38:18.003
MARISHA: Is that the same type of soot

3671
02:38:18.003 --> 02:38:19.010
that was in your pocket,

3672
02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:20.202
or is that like different soot?

3673
02:38:20.202 --> 02:38:21.824
MATT: "No, that was specifically for a ritual

3674
02:38:21.824 --> 02:38:24.756
"that was unsuccessfully attempted."

3675
02:38:24.756 --> 02:38:26.789
MARISHA: Hmm.

3676
02:38:26.789 --> 02:38:28.610
LIAM: Beauregard, could you ask him if his golems

3677
02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:30.982
are all identical, or if there is variety

3678
02:38:30.982 --> 02:38:33.695
that we are unfamiliar with?

3679
02:38:33.695 --> 02:38:36.427
MARISHA: Did you have like different lines of golems?

3680
02:38:36.427 --> 02:38:40.763
Was there like a summer like and then like a spring line,

3681
02:38:40.763 --> 02:38:43.187
or are they all pretty much the same?

3682
02:38:43.187 --> 02:38:46.682
MATT: "There are many variations, depending on

3683
02:38:46.682 --> 02:38:48.495
"what I wanted them to achieve.

LAURA: Ask him if he has any sexy golems.

3696
02:39:25.161 --> 02:39:27.899
MARISHA: That's actually a great, yeah.

3697
02:39:27.899 --> 02:39:28.732
TALIESIN: It is?

3698
02:39:28.732 --> 02:39:30.320
MARISHA: Halas.
MATT: "Yes?"

3699
02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:32.293
MARISHA: Halas.

3700
02:39:32.293 --> 02:39:34.001
Does it get a little lonely in here?

3701
02:39:34.001 --> 02:39:35.123
LAURA: (laughs)

3702
02:39:35.123 --> 02:39:36.790
MATT: "In this gem, very."

3703
02:39:38.039 --> 02:39:40.435
MARISHA: Well, it's a happy fun ball.

3704
02:39:40.435 --> 02:39:44.952
Did you ever make a sexy time golem?

3705
02:39:46.289 --> 02:39:48.058
You know.
SAM: Sex bot.

3706
02:39:48.058 --> 02:39:50.374
MARISHA: You know, like--
LIAM: Bot?

3707
02:39:50.374 --> 02:39:51.547
Bot?

3708
02:39:51.547 --> 02:39:52.380
SAM: Yes.

3709
02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:56.613
TRAVIS: Ancient, powerful wizard in a stone

3710
02:39:56.613 --> 02:39:59.002
and we're asking him if he has a fuck doll.

3711
02:39:59.002 --> 02:40:02.800
MARISHA: Hey, he knows I don't fuck around, okay?

3712
02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:04.233
So what's it going to be, Halas?

3713
02:40:04.233 --> 02:40:05.854
Come on, you got to be honest.

3714
02:40:06.729 --> 02:40:08.996
MATT: "No, I do not."

3715
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:12.520
MARISHA: No, you do not have a sex bot?

3716
02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:13.437
(laughter)

3717
02:40:13.437 --> 02:40:14.829
Or no, you do not--

3718
02:40:14.829 --> 02:40:15.763
SAM: Insight check!

3719
02:40:15.763 --> 02:40:17.529
(laughter)

3720
02:40:17.529 --> 02:40:19.149
MARISHA: Because you know, if you deny it,

3721
02:40:19.149 --> 02:40:20.799
that's almost more incriminating.

3722
02:40:20.799 --> 02:40:21.933
LAURA: He's going to hate us.

3723
02:40:21.933 --> 02:40:23.933
We should probably stop.

3724
02:40:25.586 --> 02:40:27.641
MARISHA: All right, we'll pick this up later.

3725
02:40:27.641 --> 02:40:28.949
How do we get out?

3726
02:40:30.264 --> 02:40:32.701
MATT: "There are many doors here to find."

3727
02:40:32.701 --> 02:40:34.797
LAURA: If we wanted to get into your chamber

3728
02:40:34.797 --> 02:40:37.282
that led to the Prison of Soot.

3729
02:40:37.282 --> 02:40:38.393
TALIESIN: Or the most direct way.

3730
02:40:38.393 --> 02:40:40.168
MATT: "The Circlebound Chamber.

3731
02:40:40.168 --> 02:40:42.009
"Behind one of the bookcases there should be

3732

"a black wooden door."

3733

LAURA: A black wooden door behind a bookcase.

3734
02:40:45.494 --> 02:40:47.555
MARISHA: Uh-huh, that's what he said.
LAURA: I start looking.

3735
02:40:47.555 --> 02:40:48.745
I'm assuming you're, yeah.

3736
02:40:48.745 --> 02:40:53.520
MATT: Yeah, there's one-- the one that's this

bookcase to the left of the stained glass door on the bottom

3738
02:40:57.918 --> 02:40:59.499
has been moved to the side,

3739
02:40:59.499 --> 02:41:01.227
and you can see behind it, flush against the door

3740
02:41:01.227 --> 02:41:04.257
is a hidden door made of wood that looks to be

3741
02:41:04.257 --> 02:41:06.382
charred or blackened to give it that

3742
02:41:06.382 --> 02:41:08.522
very, very dark exterior look.

3743
02:41:08.522 --> 02:41:11.488
LAURA: Hey guys, I found a door!

3744
02:41:11.488 --> 02:41:13.062
SAM: According to the map, this goes

3745
02:41:13.062 --> 02:41:14.571
to the Circlebound Chamber.

3746
02:41:14.571 --> 02:41:16.326
LAURA: Which then leads to the Prison of Soot.

3747
02:41:16.326 --> 02:41:19.752
SAM: Should we check on what we're
going to find in the circle?

3748
02:41:19.752 --> 02:41:20.585
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

3749
02:41:21.649 --> 02:41:23.257
What's with this chamber?

3750
02:41:23.257 --> 02:41:26.832
What's in the CBC?

3751
02:41:26.832 --> 02:41:29.140
MATT: "This chamber contains,

3752
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:32.273
"what's the word I'm looking for,

3753
02:41:33.197 --> 02:41:38.138
"a utility person of which has been a source

3754
02:41:38.138 --> 02:41:42.884
"of important information in some of my previous research.

3755
02:41:44.210 --> 02:41:46.885
"I hope you're not frightened by fiends?"

3756
02:41:48.541 --> 02:41:50.186
MARISHA: Well, no.

3757
02:41:50.186 --> 02:41:51.019
LAURA: What kind of fiend?

3758
02:41:51.019 --> 02:41:52.118
MATT: "Don't worry, they cannot hurt you,

3759
02:41:52.118 --> 02:41:53.726
"I have ensured that.

3760
02:41:53.726 --> 02:41:55.067
"Unless it's been tampered with.

3761
02:41:55.067 --> 02:41:56.592
"Have I been gone that long?

3762
02:41:56.592 --> 02:42:00.864
"I cannot be certain it is there.

3763
02:42:00.864 --> 02:42:02.489
"I cannot be certain it is still bound,

3764
02:42:02.489 --> 02:42:06.481
"but last I checked, what, millennia ago, it would seem,

3765
02:42:06.481 --> 02:42:08.796
"it was of no issue."

3766
02:42:08.796 --> 02:42:12.704
MARISHA: Can you be a little bit more
descriptive on what it is?

3767
02:42:12.704 --> 02:42:14.488
MATT: "It is a horned devil."

3768
02:42:14.488 --> 02:42:17.005
MARISHA: A horned devil.

3769
02:42:17.005 --> 02:42:18.824
LAURA: Like Obann?

3770
02:42:18.824 --> 02:42:20.509
MARISHA: Like a devil devil?

3771
02:42:20.509 --> 02:42:22.603
MATT: "Yes, from the Hells, yes."

3772
02:42:22.603 --> 02:42:24.775
MARISHA: From the Hells. A horned devil from the hells.

3773
02:42:24.775 --> 02:42:28.063
LIAM: Horned devil from the Hells.

3774
02:42:28.063 --> 02:42:29.855
TALIESIN: When was the last time he checked?

3775
02:42:29.855 --> 02:42:30.903
MARISHA: Well.

3776
02:42:30.903 --> 02:42:32.004
TRAVIS: Yeah, homeboy's been checked out

3777
02:42:32.004 --> 02:42:34.178
for just a hot fucking second.

3778
02:42:34.178 --> 02:42:35.469
MATT: "Whatever it is and whatever it says,

3779
02:42:35.469 --> 02:42:36.794
"do not believe it.

3780
02:42:38.413 --> 02:42:40.284
"Know that these creatures are dubious, devious,

3781
02:42:40.284 --> 02:42:44.867
"and will say whatever it takes to get what they want."

3782
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:47.592
MARISHA: All right.
SAM: Okay.

3783
02:42:47.592 --> 02:42:49.693
TRAVIS: Can he give us a detailed map of the Soot,

3784
02:42:49.693 --> 02:42:52.611
since we can't fucking talk to him when we're in there?

3785
02:42:52.611 --> 02:42:54.353
MARISHA: Well, we're not there yet.

3786
02:42:54.353 --> 02:42:57.752
The soot isn't in this chamber, right?

3787
02:42:57.752 --> 02:43:00.244
MATT: "No, it is after this chamber."

3788
02:43:00.244 --> 02:43:01.419
TRAVIS: That's what I mean, though.

3789
02:43:01.419 --> 02:43:03.208
MARISHA: Oh, but I guess, yeah, we're not going to want to--
TRAVIS: We get our questions out now.

3790
02:43:03.208 --> 02:43:05.344
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LIAM: But we're talking in the study, right?

3791
02:43:05.344 --> 02:43:08.044
SAM: We got one more room to go before the soot room.

3792
02:43:08.044 --> 02:43:11.118
LIAM: While Beauregard is walkie talkie-ing here,

3793
02:43:11.118 --> 02:43:13.708
I know, I looked at this room through Frumpkin's eyes

3794
02:43:13.708 --> 02:43:15.676
earlier and it looked rolled, and it looks rolled now,

3795
02:43:15.676 --> 02:43:19.076
but while she's talking, I'm going to look around

3796
02:43:19.076 --> 02:43:20.657
those shelves where the books were

3797
02:43:20.657 --> 02:43:22.666
and just see if I'm missing anything.

3798
02:43:22.666 --> 02:43:24.205
MATT: Make a perception check.

3799
02:43:24.205 --> 02:43:27.149
TRAVIS: Can I roll one as well
with my See Invisibility still?

3800
02:43:27.149 --> 02:43:28.661
MATT: Sure, go for it.

3801
02:43:28.661 --> 02:43:29.494
LIAM: Balls.

3802
02:43:31.812 --> 02:43:33.163
TRAVIS: 16.

3803
02:43:33.163 --> 02:43:34.060
MATT: 16.

3804
02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:35.267
All right, and what'd you get?

3805
02:43:35.267 --> 02:43:38.199
LIAM: Balls.
MATT: Okay, you notice,

3806
02:43:38.199 --> 02:43:39.390
there's the stained glass portal,

3807
02:43:39.390 --> 02:43:41.289
which you had escaped.

3808
02:43:41.289 --> 02:43:43.418
The shelves are barren.

3809
02:43:43.418 --> 02:43:47.271
Either Yussa or if anybody else has been in

3810
02:43:47.271 --> 02:43:48.484
since the last time you were in here

3811
02:43:48.484 --> 02:43:51.444
has taken most anything of interest out of this chamber.

3812
02:43:52.486 --> 02:43:56.744
You notice that there is the single brown door

3813
02:43:56.744 --> 02:43:59.542
that you came out of, which also leads back,

3814
02:43:59.542 --> 02:44:01.593
you would assume, to the entrance you first arrived at

3815
02:44:01.593 --> 02:44:04.797
when you first came here.

3816
02:44:04.797 --> 02:44:07.321
There was also a red gold door

3817
02:44:07.321 --> 02:44:10.546
that is exposed

3818
02:44:12.887 --> 02:44:15.120
near the opposite end of the chamber,

3819
02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:18.789
where it looks like there was some sort of a tapestry

3820
02:44:18.789 --> 02:44:21.607
that's been torn off now and has revealed this door.

3821
02:44:21.607 --> 02:44:23.998
You also notice there is a trapdoor

3822
02:44:23.998 --> 02:44:27.630
exposed under the carpet that is now askew.

3823
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:28.463
MARISHA: Hmm.

3824
02:44:28.463 --> 02:44:30.047
LIAM: We didn't really have time to search this place

3825
02:44:30.047 --> 02:44:32.780
our first visit here.

3826
02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:34.156
TALIESIN: Well, we do know that there's--

3827
02:44:34.156 --> 02:44:36.308
TRAVIS: Hey, here's a surefire way to figure out

3828
02:44:36.308 --> 02:44:38.058
where each door goes.

3829
02:44:40.735 --> 02:44:43.825
LAURA: Can I go up to the painting of Halas?

3830
02:44:43.825 --> 02:44:44.858
Oh, that's pen!

3831
02:44:44.858 --> 02:44:46.533
You're going to write on it in pen?
TALIESIN: Do you have a pencil?

3832
02:44:46.533 --> 02:44:48.504
LAURA: Yeah, here.
TALIESIN: Can I grab that?

3833
02:44:48.504 --> 02:44:50.891
LAURA: I go to the painting of Halas.

3834
02:44:50.891 --> 02:44:55.331
Do I notice any like, scars or anything on the painting,

3835
02:44:55.331 --> 02:44:57.183
that would make him look a little different

3836
02:44:57.183 --> 02:44:59.294
than the body that we have?

3837
02:44:59.294 --> 02:45:00.506
MATT: Make a perception check.

3838
02:45:00.506 --> 02:45:01.521
MARISHA: Yes.

3839
02:45:01.521 --> 02:45:04.799
LAURA: ♪ Oh Traveler, guide me ♪

3840
02:45:04.799 --> 02:45:05.632
Damn it.

3841
02:45:10.464 --> 02:45:11.906
13.

3842
02:45:11.906 --> 02:45:13.097
MATT: 13?

3843
02:45:13.097 --> 02:45:16.342
I mean, it's a painting, and paintings are generally

3844
02:45:16.342 --> 02:45:19.565
intended to be an optimal representation of an individual,

3845
02:45:19.565 --> 02:45:23.333
so it looks pretty consistent with the body

3846
02:45:23.333 --> 02:45:25.652
that you're currently lugging on top

3847
02:45:25.652 --> 02:45:27.652
of Caduceus' shoulders.

3848
02:45:28.562 --> 02:45:29.395
LAURA: Okay.

3849
02:45:32.002 --> 02:45:34.292
MARISHA: All right, well.

3850
02:45:34.292 --> 02:45:35.734
Did you find anything, we're good?

3851
02:45:35.734 --> 02:45:36.718
You didn't find shit.

3852
02:45:36.718 --> 02:45:38.224
LIAM: This place has been emptied.

3853
02:45:38.224 --> 02:45:41.274
TALIESIN: There's no faster way to the Prison of Soot?

3854
02:45:41.274 --> 02:45:43.128
MARISHA: Hey Halas.

3855
02:45:43.128 --> 02:45:47.711
What's behind this, like, gold and red door, by the by?

3856
02:45:47.711 --> 02:45:48.916
Just curious.

3857
02:45:48.916 --> 02:45:51.290
MATT: "The gold and red door leads to
my personal bed chambers,

3858
02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:53.349
"I would not recommend going there."

3859
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:54.602
LIAM: That's where the sex bot is.

3860
02:45:54.602 --> 02:45:57.126
MARISHA: I was going to say, you beat me to it.

3861
02:45:57.126 --> 02:45:58.917
Okay.
(laughter)

3862
02:45:58.917 --> 02:46:02.380
Just another point in the sexbot's favor.

3863
02:46:02.380 --> 02:46:03.667
LAURA: What's the Fleshmend Facility?

3864
02:46:03.667 --> 02:46:06.272
MATT: "There is no sex bot, it is heavily trapped,

3865
02:46:06.272 --> 02:46:08.158
"and I will not tell you how to disable them

3866
02:46:08.158 --> 02:46:10.400
"because you should not go in there.

3867
02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.362
"At your own risk."

3868
02:46:12.362 --> 02:46:14.576
SAM: He doesn't want us to go in the bedroom?

3869
02:46:14.576 --> 02:46:15.851
MARISHA: No.

3870
02:46:15.851 --> 02:46:16.901
SAM: Ooh.
MARISHA: I know.

3871
02:46:16.901 --> 02:46:18.001
SAM: Ooh!

3872
02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:19.999
MARISHA: He said it's heavily trapped
and he's not going to tell us

3873
02:46:19.999 --> 02:46:21.282
because he doesn't want us rummaging

3874
02:46:21.282 --> 02:46:24.591
through his sex bots.
SAM: He doesn't have a choice.

3875
02:46:26.253 --> 02:46:28.211
He needs us. If we die in his bedroom,

3876
02:46:28.211 --> 02:46:29.344
he doesn't get out of here.

3877
02:46:29.344 --> 02:46:31.586
TRAVIS: No, he's been in here for hundreds of years,

3878
02:46:31.586 --> 02:46:33.737
if not longer, I think he's okay with it.

3879
02:46:33.737 --> 02:46:36.556
LAURA: And now he's, like, in an easier place to get to.

3880
02:46:36.556 --> 02:46:38.751
He's like right in the entryway.

3881
02:46:38.751 --> 02:46:41.112
SAM: I can disable a trap or two.

3882
02:46:41.112 --> 02:46:42.931
TALIESIN: Why are you even thinking about it?

3883
02:46:42.931 --> 02:46:44.366
SAM: Why doesn't he want us to go in there?

3884
02:46:44.366 --> 02:46:47.024
TALIESIN and LAURA: Because it's his bedroom.

3885
02:46:47.024 --> 02:46:50.835
SAM: Do you have anything your bedroom that I can't see?

3886
02:46:50.835 --> 02:46:54.840
TALIESIN: Well, no, but I don't really have a bedroom.

3887
02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:56.383
SAM: We did at the Xhorhouse.

3888
02:46:56.383 --> 02:46:57.618
TALIESIN: No, I really don't.

3889
02:46:57.618 --> 02:46:59.623
LAURA: He didn't, he slept on the roof.

3890
02:46:59.623 --> 02:47:02.581
TRAVIS: If the astral dreadnought wasn't enough,

3891
02:47:02.581 --> 02:47:05.130
we're going to go in the ancient wizard's bedroom.

3892
02:47:05.130 --> 02:47:07.057
LAURA: Poor Yussa's just waiting and waiting!

3893
02:47:07.057 --> 02:47:09.454
TALIESIN: Let's just not be rude to someone who's doing us--

3894
02:47:09.454 --> 02:47:11.549
I feel like he's being very fair so far.

3895
02:47:11.549 --> 02:47:12.421
SAM: You're totally right.

3896
02:47:12.421 --> 02:47:14.066
TALIESIN: Let's not aggravate somebody who--

3897
02:47:14.066 --> 02:47:15.640
SAM: There's just, could be stuff to steal there,

3898
02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:17.048
I like stealing stuff.
LAURA: You've stolen a lot

3899
02:47:17.048 --> 02:47:18.206
of stuff here already.

3900
02:47:18.206 --> 02:47:21.306
SAM: Have I stolen your heart?
LAURA: You know, if we were going to steal any--

3901
02:47:21.306 --> 02:47:24.189
oh, you did that right away.

3902
02:47:24.189 --> 02:47:28.071
If we want to steal stuff, there is the fucking hoard

3903
02:47:28.071 --> 02:47:30.881
that was left behind by the blue dragon

3904
02:47:30.881 --> 02:47:32.739
that we didn't get to take anything from.

3905
02:47:32.739 --> 02:47:34.029
TALIESIN: Which will be on the way out.

3906
02:47:34.029 --> 02:47:34.862
LAURA: Exactly.

3907
02:47:34.862 --> 02:47:37.496
LIAM: To be honest, I am dreadfully curious

3908
02:47:37.496 --> 02:47:40.507
about what most personal items and writings

3909
02:47:40.507 --> 02:47:42.662
might be in his bedroom. However, I feel like

3910
02:47:42.662 --> 02:47:44.388
we have pushed our luck quite hard here.

3911
02:47:44.388 --> 02:47:45.597
TALIESIN: I would've been more excited

3912
02:47:45.597 --> 02:47:48.215
if he hadn't been a living person.

3913
02:47:48.215 --> 02:47:49.592
MARISHA: Hey, Yussa.

3914
02:47:49.592 --> 02:47:50.648
MATT: (as Halas) "Yes?"

3915
02:47:50.648 --> 02:47:51.481
SAM: That's not Yussa.

3916
02:47:51.481 --> 02:47:53.786
MARISHA: I mean, fuck. Halas.

3917
02:47:53.786 --> 02:47:54.700
MATT: I know what you meant.

3918
02:47:54.700 --> 02:47:56.129
MARISHA: Hello.

3919
02:47:56.129 --> 02:47:57.229
TRAVIS: Freudian slip.

3920
02:47:57.229 --> 02:47:58.062
MARISHA: I know.

3921
02:47:58.062 --> 02:47:59.892
Wait, this isn't Yussa, is it?

3922
02:47:59.892 --> 02:48:01.104
Are you Yussa?

3923
02:48:02.462 --> 02:48:03.337
All right.

3924
02:48:03.337 --> 02:48:05.248
LAURA: He's over it.

3925
02:48:05.248 --> 02:48:07.699
LIAM and LAURA: He's so over us.

3926
02:48:07.699 --> 02:48:10.389
MARISHA: What's behind this trapdoor?

3927
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:12.025
Because we found a few of them, we're just curious.

3928
02:48:12.025 --> 02:48:14.178
MATT: "The trapdoor leads to the Fleshmend Facility.

3929
02:48:14.178 --> 02:48:18.652
"It is where I tend to any injuries that I sustain."

3930
02:48:18.652 --> 02:48:20.777
MARISHA: Oh, it's kind of what we thought.

3931
02:48:20.777 --> 02:48:22.577
It's like a doctor.

3932
02:48:22.577 --> 02:48:25.158
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, fleshmend, that sounds
like it mends flesh.

3933
02:48:25.158 --> 02:48:26.280
MARISHA: That's pretty cool.

3934
02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:27.580
LAURA: Which one leads to the circ--

3935
02:48:27.580 --> 02:48:28.596
oh, that's the black one.

3936
02:48:28.596 --> 02:48:29.646
That's where we're going.

3937
02:48:29.646 --> 02:48:32.288
MARISHA: All right, is there--
TRAVIS: Any doors we haven't seen that we should

3938
02:48:32.288 --> 02:48:33.270
know about in this room?

3939
02:48:33.270 --> 02:48:34.417
MARISHA: Anything else cool?

3940
02:48:34.417 --> 02:48:35.892
We're just curious because we're, like,

3941
02:48:35.892 --> 02:48:37.613
taking a little tour, you know.

3942
02:48:37.613 --> 02:48:40.846
MATT: "From the study, there is the

3943
02:48:40.846 --> 02:48:42.554
"tapestry entrance chamber

3944
02:48:42.554 --> 02:48:47.554
"through the soft wooden door, and if you press on to

3945
02:48:48.147 --> 02:48:52.649
the red location on the stained glass,

3946
02:48:52.649 --> 02:48:53.959
it brings you to the dragon's lair,

3947
02:48:53.959 --> 02:48:57.687
but you said you've already visited this dragon?

3948
02:48:57.687 --> 02:48:58.875
MARISHA: Yep.

3949
02:48:58.875 --> 02:49:01.037
What's his name?

3950
02:49:01.037 --> 02:49:02.628
MATT: "Why do you ask?"

3951
02:49:02.628 --> 02:49:03.511
MARISHA: I don't know.

3952
02:49:03.511 --> 02:49:05.086
I just want to know what you named your dragon.

3953
02:49:05.086 --> 02:49:06.236
Did you name it or did--

3954
02:49:06.236 --> 02:49:08.294
MATT: "I don't name the dragons, a dragon is named,

3955
02:49:08.294 --> 02:49:11.840
"but then I use its name to bind it."

3956
02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:15.173
MARISHA: Well, you're an intense person, Halas.

3957
02:49:16.126 --> 02:49:17.612
MATT: "You've seen my home.

3958
02:49:17.612 --> 02:49:19.579
"You did not assume this already?"

3959
02:49:19.579 --> 02:49:21.255
(laughter)

3960
02:49:21.255 --> 02:49:23.030
TRAVIS: I'm intense as fuck.

3961
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:24.855
MARISHA: So what'd you name your dragon?

3962
02:49:24.855 --> 02:49:27.577
Or what's the dragon's name?

3963
02:49:27.577 --> 02:49:28.527
LAURA: Oh my god.

3964
02:49:28.527 --> 02:49:29.777
LIAM: How do you name a dragon?

3965
02:49:29.777 --> 02:49:31.496
(laughter)

3966
02:49:31.496 --> 02:49:33.265
LAURA: Fleshmend Facil-- I mean, let's go to

3967
02:49:33.265 --> 02:49:35.307
the fucking Circlebound Chamber.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3968
02:49:35.307 --> 02:49:38.620
MATT: "Thelashas was the name that it had.

3969
02:49:39.928 --> 02:49:42.467
"Unless it's changed it since, that is the name

3970
02:49:42.467 --> 02:49:43.423
"of the dragon."

3971
02:49:43.423 --> 02:49:45.253
MARISHA: That's a decent amount of clerical work

3972
02:49:45.253 --> 02:49:48.447
you have to go through. He probably hasn't.

3973
02:49:48.447 --> 02:49:50.006
MATT: "Then let us continue, please."

3974
02:49:50.006 --> 02:49:53.022
MATT: All right, so, I'm going to put him down.

3975
02:49:53.022 --> 02:49:54.827
Okay, we got to, we're not going to really

3976
02:49:54.827 --> 02:49:56.271
talk to him in the chamber, right?

3977
02:49:56.271 --> 02:49:58.612
We're just going to go through the chamber--
SAM: In the next chamber, we can talk to him.

3978
02:49:58.612 --> 02:49:59.673
LAURA: Barely, because there's a fiend.

3979
02:49:59.673 --> 02:50:02.640
MARISHA: There's a horned devil there.
SAM: Who cares, he can't hurt us.

3980
02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:03.967
MARISHA: We don't know that yet.

3981
02:50:03.967 --> 02:50:06.883
TRAVIS: As long as he hasn't broken free of his bonds,

3982
02:50:06.883 --> 02:50:09.176
and it's been hundreds of years.
LIAM: And Beauregard said that he's unclear

3983
02:50:09.176 --> 02:50:10.447
whether he's still in his bindings.

3984
02:50:10.447 --> 02:50:12.083
He's been here for centuries.
LAURA: We should get ready to fight just in case.

3985
02:50:12.083 --> 02:50:13.363
MARISHA: I think we should as well.
LAURA: Be ready.

3986
02:50:13.363 --> 02:50:16.409
TRAVIS: Yes, we should ask a Q&amp;A, last chance,

3987
02:50:16.409 --> 02:50:18.192
what do we need to know about the Prison of Soot,

3988
02:50:18.192 --> 02:50:19.835
what to look out for, where are the traps,

3989
02:50:19.835 --> 02:50:24.299
how do we get through them all?

3990
02:50:24.299 --> 02:50:25.561
MARISHA: Okay.

3991
02:50:25.561 --> 02:50:26.984
SAM: Want me to do it?

3992
02:50:26.984 --> 02:50:28.214
MARISHA: Yeah, you want to talk to him?

3993
02:50:28.214 --> 02:50:29.149
SAM: Yeah.

3994
02:50:29.149 --> 02:50:30.906
MARISHA: Hey, Halas.

3995
02:50:30.906 --> 02:50:32.863
MATT: "Yes, Beau?"
TRAVIS: I know the first thing out your--

3996
02:50:32.863 --> 02:50:33.713
TALIESIN: No.

3997
02:50:33.713 --> 02:50:37.167
MARISHA: I'm going to hand you over to Nott.

3998
02:50:37.167 --> 02:50:38.000
TALIESIN: Well.

3999
02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:38.967
MATT: "Very well."

4000
02:50:38.967 --> 02:50:40.120
TRAVIS: This is happening.

4001
02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:41.560
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on!

4002
02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:42.410
TRAVIS: Let's go.

4003
02:50:42.410 --> 02:50:43.243
Hand it over.

4004
02:50:43.243 --> 02:50:45.445
MARISHA: Are you going to immediately ask how to--

4005
02:50:45.445 --> 02:50:47.174
SAM: No, I'm going to ask him about the traps,

4006
02:50:47.174 --> 02:50:48.882
I'm the trap person.

4007
02:50:48.882 --> 02:50:50.286
MARISHA: You're going to immediately ask about--

4008
02:50:50.286 --> 02:50:52.775
SAM: No, I'm going to ask him about the traps.
TRAVIS: Hand it over.

4009
02:50:53.850 --> 02:50:55.100
SAM: Halas?

4010
02:50:55.100 --> 02:50:56.119
MATT: "Yes?"

4011
02:50:56.119 --> 02:50:58.070
SAM: Nott the Brave here.

4012
02:50:58.070 --> 02:51:01.273
MATT: "Your name is Nott?"
SAM: We're going to be going into your Prison of Soot,

4013
02:51:01.273 --> 02:51:03.818
and we wondered if there's any traps

4014
02:51:03.818 --> 02:51:05.491
that we should know about going in

4015
02:51:05.491 --> 02:51:08.205
so that we don't fall into them.

4016
02:51:08.205 --> 02:51:10.154
MATT: "I do not recall any traps.

4017
02:51:10.154 --> 02:51:12.960
"It is not designed to be a trapped chamber;

"and information gathering chamber."

4020
02:51:17.925 --> 02:51:20.186
SAM: How many levels are there?

4021
02:51:20.186 --> 02:51:22.998
MATT: "It is a singular chamber."

4022
02:51:22.998 --> 02:51:24.994
SAM: It's just one room.
MATT: "Yes."

4023
02:51:24.994 --> 02:51:28.128
SAM: But you said there was two prisoners per chamber.

4024
02:51:28.128 --> 02:51:29.238
MATT: "That is the prison."

4025
02:51:29.238 --> 02:51:30.801
SAM: Oh, I'm asking about the Prison of Soot.

4026
02:51:30.801 --> 02:51:32.131
MATT: "I misunderstood."
SAM: I'm sorry.

4027
02:51:32.131 --> 02:51:34.562
No, I have an accent.

4028
02:51:34.562 --> 02:51:37.079
MATT: "I've been in a gem for a long time."

4029
02:51:37.079 --> 02:51:38.156
(laughter)

4030
02:51:38.156 --> 02:51:39.676
SAM: I feel you.

4031
02:51:39.676 --> 02:51:42.541
MATT: "The prison I believe was designed to contain

4032
02:51:42.541 --> 02:51:46.134

SAM: Hi, we're going on a three way call.

4035
02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:56.080
LAURA: Can you hear me?

4036
02:51:57.146 --> 02:51:58.188
MATT: "Hello, Jester."

4037
02:51:58.188 --> 02:51:59.601
LAURA: Hi!

4038
02:51:59.601 --> 02:52:00.889
Wait.

4039
02:52:00.889 --> 02:52:03.416
Did I tell him my name before?

4040
02:52:03.416 --> 02:52:05.555
SAM: That's creepy.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I believe you did.

4041
02:52:05.555 --> 02:52:06.805
LAURA: Did I?

4042
02:52:06.805 --> 02:52:08.723
Do you guys remember me telling him my name?

4043
02:52:08.723 --> 02:52:10.424
SAM: That's fine.
TRAVIS: I like your freckles.

4044
02:52:10.424 --> 02:52:12.104
LAURA: Thanks.
MARISHA: I know, aren't they cute?

4045
02:52:12.104 --> 02:52:13.277
SAM: They're so awesome.

4046
02:52:13.277 --> 02:52:15.605
LAURA: Thanks, you guys.

4047
02:52:15.605 --> 02:52:18.751
Okay, so where do the new prisoners go?

4048
02:52:18.751 --> 02:52:21.260
Do they go up from like, fill up from the bottom to the top,

4049
02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:24.926
or the top to the bottom, or are they put in randomly?

4050
02:52:25.834 --> 02:52:30.677
MATT: "The programming on the
golems is particularly limited.

MATT: "You use the golem to unlock them.

"Or I unlock them myself."

SAM: Well, you're not here, so.

4058
02:52:46.624 --> 02:52:49.775
MATT: "So you would have to improvise."

4059
02:52:49.775 --> 02:52:50.841
LAURA: Okay.

4060
02:52:52.383 --> 02:52:56.060
SAM: Will we know who's in the
chamber before we open a door?

4061
02:52:56.060 --> 02:52:58.158
MATT: "The cells are open."

4062
02:52:58.158 --> 02:52:59.637
SAM: The cells are open.
LAURA: Oh.

4063
02:52:59.637 --> 02:53:02.780
MATT: "Meaning there are bars, so."

4064
02:53:02.780 --> 02:53:05.597
SAM: Oh, I see, so we'll see who's in there

4065
02:53:05.597 --> 02:53:08.195
and we can only open the ones that we want to.

4066
02:53:08.195 --> 02:53:10.790
TRAVIS: Dedicated golems in the prison? If so, how many?

4067

"You are welcome to try it, but I cannot guarantee

02:53:45.238 --> 02:53:46.872
"it would do in your favor.

02:53:46.872 --> 02:53:48.747
TRAVIS: Are they attracted to arcane users

4081
02:53:48.747 --> 02:53:50.031
if they're not casting?

4082
02:53:50.031 --> 02:53:52.316
SAM: Are they like your fireflies?

4083
02:53:52.316 --> 02:53:54.867
MATT: "Ah, yes, you've made your way through the Garden.

4084
02:53:54.867 --> 02:53:57.986
"They are drawn to the usage of magic."

4085
02:53:57.986 --> 02:53:58.819
LAURA: Got it.

4086
02:53:58.819 --> 02:54:00.230
And then the voice thing.

4087
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:02.037
Does it have anything to do with volume,

4088
02:54:02.037 --> 02:54:04.604
or is it just amount of words?

4089
02:54:04.604 --> 02:54:08.526
MATT: "Vibration of the vocal cords of any kind of speech

4090
02:54:08.526 --> 02:54:11.130
"is what will draw the soot."

4091
02:54:11.130 --> 02:54:14.616
SAM: Oh, we can write, that's an excellent idea, Fjord.

4092
02:54:14.616 --> 02:54:16.701
TALIESIN: Your paints might be a way out through the--

4093
02:54:16.701 --> 02:54:19.194
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, good idea.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4094
02:54:19.194 --> 02:54:22.777
SAM: And how do you change a body permanently?

4095
02:54:24.332 --> 02:54:26.547
MATT: "I'm uncertain what the question is referring to."

4096
02:54:26.547 --> 02:54:29.988
SAM: We found some notes in your lab

4097
02:54:29.988 --> 02:54:33.472
that you could possibly alter a body permanently

4098
02:54:33.472 --> 02:54:36.078
or change someone into another person?

4099
02:54:36.078 --> 02:54:37.869
MATT: "There are number of things.

acquired by someone like me, with a limited ability,

4109

or a wizard.

MATT: Like things I could discuss once you let me

4115
02:55:20.293 --> 02:55:24.920
out of this device and return me to my physical body.

4116
02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:26.805
TRAVIS: Does he have any problem with us

4117
02:55:26.805 --> 02:55:29.358
taking someone else with us and leaving

4118
02:55:29.358 --> 02:55:31.325
in exchange for letting him out?

4119
02:55:31.325 --> 02:55:33.472
SAM: Taking someone with us and leaving?

4120
02:55:33.472 --> 02:55:36.216
Oh, I think he knows that, right?

4121
02:55:36.216 --> 02:55:37.684
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4122
02:55:37.684 --> 02:55:38.930
TRAVIS: We've said that, clearly?

4123
02:55:38.930 --> 02:55:39.763
TALIESIN: Yes.

4124
02:55:39.763 --> 02:55:41.524
SAM: We're going to be breaking someone out of your prison.

4125
02:55:41.524 --> 02:55:43.538
Do you have a problem with that?

4126
02:55:43.538 --> 02:55:46.256
MATT: "Not if it means that your end of the bargain

4127
02:55:46.256 --> 02:55:47.790
"is maintained."

4128
02:55:50.716 --> 02:55:51.716
SAM: All right.

4129
02:55:54.728 --> 02:55:56.252
Let's go in.

4130
02:55:56.252 --> 02:55:57.235
LAURA: Let's do it.

4131
02:55:57.235 --> 02:55:58.493
MATT: All right, so you're stepping through

4132
02:55:58.493 --> 02:56:00.023
the door towards the--

4133
02:56:00.023 --> 02:56:01.281
LAURA: Circlebound.

4134
02:56:01.281 --> 02:56:02.328
MATT: Circlebound Chamber.

4135
02:56:02.328 --> 02:56:03.246
All righty.

4136
02:56:03.246 --> 02:56:04.079
MARISHA: The CBC.

4137
02:56:05.344 --> 02:56:08.643
MATT: As you step past the doorway, this one isn't,

4138
02:56:08.643 --> 02:56:11.300
you're used to the rush and the vacuum-like pull

4139
02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:13.006
from room to room.

4140
02:56:13.006 --> 02:56:15.890
This one seems relatively calm, like stepping across

4141
02:56:15.890 --> 02:56:20.017
soft cobblestones through a short hallway.

4142
02:56:20.017 --> 02:56:22.296
Partway through that hallway the smell changes

4143
02:56:22.296 --> 02:56:27.062
into a heavy smoke with a hint of sulfur to it.

4144
02:56:28.192 --> 02:56:30.864
You pass a threshold you didn't know was there

4145
02:56:30.864 --> 02:56:33.898
until suddenly your eyesight changes and shifts,

4146
02:56:33.898 --> 02:56:38.205
and this dark, charcoal-colored room now surrounds you.

4147
02:56:38.205 --> 02:56:40.590
Deep red tapestries hang from the walls,

4148
02:56:40.590 --> 02:56:42.685
depicting elements of the Blood War

4149
02:56:42.685 --> 02:56:45.079
between devils and demons.

4150
02:56:45.079 --> 02:56:49.284
All sorts of massive, grotesque,

4151
02:56:49.284 --> 02:56:52.480
violent and detailed displays of carnage

4152
02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:55.291
between the two warring factions of fiends

4153
02:56:55.291 --> 02:56:59.276
surround the interior of this chamber.

4154
02:56:59.276 --> 02:57:02.660
A blood-soaked table sits next to a rough hewn stone door

4155
02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:06.384
that holds all manner of gruesome cutting and carving tools.

4156
02:57:06.384 --> 02:57:07.867
There's also a large empty basket,

4157
02:57:07.867 --> 02:57:11.527
equally splattered with dry gore.

4158
02:57:11.527 --> 02:57:13.455
A few other small tables and a singular shelf

4159
02:57:13.455 --> 02:57:14.806
line the edges of the room.

4160
02:57:14.806 --> 02:57:17.239
In the center of the room, a 15-foot circle

4161
02:57:17.239 --> 02:57:20.874
of dull burning purple light strikes lines

4162
02:57:20.874 --> 02:57:23.296
between its boundaries in a tangled glyph,

4163
02:57:23.296 --> 02:57:24.761
and sitting atop the strange circle

4164
02:57:24.761 --> 02:57:27.510
is a set of folded leathery wings

4165
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:32.418
wrapped like an egg of textured skin.

4166
02:57:32.418 --> 02:57:33.718
LAURA: Cool.

4167
02:57:35.991 --> 02:57:37.733
TRAVIS: Sitting on top of the glyph?

4168
02:57:37.733 --> 02:57:38.818
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4169
02:57:38.818 --> 02:57:40.921
LAURA: Let's just ignore him and keep going.

4170
02:57:40.921 --> 02:57:41.754
MARISHA: Yeah.

4171
02:57:41.754 --> 02:57:43.826
SAM: Do we see any other doors?

4172
02:57:43.826 --> 02:57:45.952
TRAVIS: No cages, no constraints, no manacles.

4173
02:57:45.952 --> 02:57:48.405
MATT: You do see a rough-hewn stone door

4174
02:57:48.405 --> 02:57:49.483
on the opposite end of the chamber.

4175
02:57:49.483 --> 02:57:52.824
TRAVIS: No cages, no manacles, no open chains, no broken?

4176
02:57:52.824 --> 02:57:55.163
MATT: Make a perception check.

4177
02:57:55.163 --> 02:57:57.188
SAM: Should I ask?
TRAVIS: 18.

4178
02:57:57.188 --> 02:57:58.031
MATT: 18?

4179
02:57:58.031 --> 02:58:00.128
You don't see any chains, nothing.

4180
02:58:00.128 --> 02:58:01.592
MARISHA: Let's just go, let's just move.

4181
02:58:01.592 --> 02:58:03.032
LAURA: But we don't know which door it is.

4182
02:58:03.032 --> 02:58:04.407
TRAVIS: Wait wait, before we go.

4183
02:58:04.407 --> 02:58:05.833
We have to figure out how we're writing stuff, right?

4184
02:58:05.833 --> 02:58:07.491
Because past this we're in the soot.

4185
02:58:07.491 --> 02:58:08.324
SAM: Get out some paper.

4186
02:58:08.324 --> 02:58:10.175
LAURA: Yeah, I take out my journal.

4187
02:58:10.175 --> 02:58:11.216
TRAVIS: Caleb has some.

4188
02:58:11.216 --> 02:58:14.838
LIAM: I hand out some paper scraps to people.

4189
02:58:14.838 --> 02:58:17.116
SAM: Is that rough-hewn stone door

4190
02:58:17.116 --> 02:58:19.367
the way to the Prison of Soot?

4191
02:58:19.367 --> 02:58:21.197
MATT: "That is."

4192
02:58:21.197 --> 02:58:22.933
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: What is it?

4193
02:58:22.933 --> 02:58:24.491
MATT: Sorry, the rough-hewn door, sorry.

4194
02:58:24.491 --> 02:58:27.705
"The rough-hewn door is not,
that leads to the Carving Farm."

4195
02:58:27.705 --> 02:58:30.488
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's the wrong door.

4196
02:58:30.488 --> 02:58:33.430
SAM: What door are we looking?

4197
02:58:33.430 --> 02:58:37.347
What's a Carving Farm? Is it a butcher?

4198
02:58:37.347 --> 02:58:42.264
MATT: "It's a chamber that I use to maintain my sustenance.

4199
02:58:43.604 --> 02:58:46.175
SAM: To maintain his sustenance.

4200
02:58:46.175 --> 02:58:47.550
MARISHA: This guy's fucking weird.

4201
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:50.449
SAM: You eat meat, you carve meat?

4202
02:58:50.449 --> 02:58:52.723
MATT: "I eat and carve meat, yes, have it prepared

4203
02:58:52.723 --> 02:58:54.302
"by one of my golems."

4204
02:58:54.302 --> 02:58:57.176
SAM: Meat, what kind of meat?

4205
02:58:57.176 --> 02:58:59.166
MATT: "You are so curious."

4206
02:58:59.166 --> 02:59:03.071
SAM: We just want to know how to be safe.

4207
02:59:03.071 --> 02:59:05.849
MATT: "Avoid the Carving Farm."

4208
02:59:05.849 --> 02:59:08.546
SAM: He says not to go in there.

4209
02:59:08.546 --> 02:59:10.523
TRAVIS: We should totally go in there.
MARISHA: We should totally go!

4210
02:59:10.523 --> 02:59:11.898
LAURA: No, we shouldn't go in there.

4211
02:59:11.898 --> 02:59:13.656
TRAVIS: Oh, we don't go in the Carving Farm?
LIAM: We don't go into his bedroom, and

4212
02:59:13.656 --> 02:59:15.420
we want to go in the Carving Farm?

4213
02:59:15.420 --> 02:59:16.628
LAURA: Exactly.

4214
02:59:16.628 --> 02:59:18.693
TRAVIS: The astral dreadnought?

4215
02:59:18.693 --> 02:59:22.435
LIAM: Could've gone into the bedroom
if you wanted to poke about.

4216
02:59:22.435 --> 02:59:26.938
What kind of beast does he feed himself from?

4217
02:59:26.938 --> 02:59:28.088
SAM: What do you like to eat?

4218
02:59:28.088 --> 02:59:29.482
We have some vegans in the group

4219
02:59:29.482 --> 02:59:30.910
and they're just sort of curious.

4220
02:59:30.910 --> 02:59:35.812
MATT: "Why are you so interested in changing bodies?

4221
02:59:35.812 --> 02:59:38.552
"You've asked quite intensely about wanting to know

4222
02:59:38.552 --> 02:59:41.577
"of this magic and its acquisition."

4223
02:59:42.542 --> 02:59:46.270
SAM: It's something that I'm curious in.

4224
02:59:46.270 --> 02:59:48.127
MATT: "You seem unlike any goblin I've encountered

4225
02:59:48.127 --> 02:59:50.930
"in my times here."

4226
02:59:50.930 --> 02:59:53.625
SAM: You seem unlike any ruby I've encountered.

4227
02:59:53.625 --> 02:59:55.148
MATT: "Touche."

4228
02:59:55.148 --> 02:59:57.697
LIAM: Press him on that one question.

4229
02:59:57.697 --> 02:59:59.504
MATT: The wings begin to unfold.

4230
02:59:59.504 --> 03:00:01.750
MARISHA: We should go, we should go. We got to go.

4231
03:00:01.750 --> 03:00:06.750
MATT: Standing you see this 12-foot tall humanoid creature

4232
03:00:07.062 --> 03:00:10.380
from beneath, the edges of the circle

4233
03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:13.273
just barely hitting the perimeter as his wings expand.

4234
03:00:14.829 --> 03:00:18.154
Seem to flash against some sort of a faintly,

4235
03:00:18.154 --> 03:00:20.729
only momentarily available barrier

4236
03:00:20.729 --> 03:00:22.895
before it vanishes from sight,

4237
03:00:22.895 --> 03:00:25.277
like each impact causes it

4238
03:00:25.277 --> 03:00:27.884
to show up for a second before it dissipates.

4239
03:00:27.884 --> 03:00:31.852
You see two large clawed hands press against it

4240
03:00:31.852 --> 03:00:36.002
as this large devilish humanoid of dull red and brown skin,

4241
03:00:36.002 --> 03:00:40.978
clawed, hooked fingers, these hoof-like backwards legs,

4242
03:00:40.978 --> 03:00:44.808
a long pointed tail, and heavy set of curled horns

4243
03:00:44.808 --> 03:00:47.027
that protrude from each side of its head.

4244
03:00:47.027 --> 03:00:49.370
Its burning red eyes and fanged jaw

4245
03:00:49.370 --> 03:00:51.776
facing in your direction.

4246
03:00:51.776 --> 03:00:53.519
It just looks out to all of you.

4247
03:00:53.519 --> 03:00:56.542
TRAVIS: Happy Halloween, motherfuckers.
MARISHA: Let's not, let's--

4248
03:00:56.542 --> 03:00:58.369
SAM: Where's the door, where's the door, Halas?

4249
03:00:58.369 --> 03:01:01.811
MATT: (as Horned Devil) "Ah, ah! Words, it has words.

4250
03:01:01.811 --> 03:01:06.744
"Words, oh it has been some time, some time.

4251
03:01:06.744 --> 03:01:08.613
"Words, it's been some time."

4252
03:01:08.613 --> 03:01:11.069
MARISHA: I start looking around for another door.

4253
03:01:11.069 --> 03:01:13.181
MATT: Make a perception check.
TALIESIN: Ditto.

4254
03:01:13.181 --> 03:01:15.939
SAM: Is the thing chained to anything, or is it just--

4255
03:01:15.939 --> 03:01:18.305
TRAVIS: No, it is inside like an invisible dome.

4256
03:01:18.305 --> 03:01:19.764
LIAM: It's bound.
TALIESIN: 27.

4257
03:01:19.764 --> 03:01:21.002
TRAVIS: Bell jar.

4258
03:01:21.002 --> 03:01:22.627
MATT: "It has been some time.

4259
03:01:22.627 --> 03:01:25.041
"Time, time, what a construct, time."

4260
03:01:25.041 --> 03:01:26.150
MARISHA: 10.

4261
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:28.293
MATT: "(giggling) What an idea, time.

4262
03:01:28.293 --> 03:01:30.534
"What time is it?"

4263
03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:34.950
TRAVIS: We couldn't tell you.
LIAM: Hard to say in here.

4264
03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:36.948
MATT: It gets close to the glass in your direction

4265
03:01:36.948 --> 03:01:37.781
after you say that phrase.

4266
03:01:37.781 --> 03:01:38.914
What'd you roll?
TALIESIN: 27.

4267
03:01:38.914 --> 03:01:39.768
MATT: And you rolled a?

4268
03:01:39.768 --> 03:01:40.601
MARISHA: 10.

4269
03:01:42.758 --> 03:01:46.308
MATT: Behind where this circle is,

4270
03:01:46.308 --> 03:01:49.533
there's about a 10-foot gap, and you can see a set of drapes

4271
03:01:49.533 --> 03:01:53.028
that are closed, and from the bottom of it

4272
03:01:53.028 --> 03:01:56.028
you can see the bottom of a doorway.

4273
03:01:59.204 --> 03:02:01.885
With that high a perception roll, what little light there is

4274
03:02:01.885 --> 03:02:04.775
from each flash of this creature
putting its hands against the barrier.

4275
03:02:04.775 --> 03:02:06.414
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly start making my way there.

4276
03:02:06.414 --> 03:02:09.067
MATT: It looks like a dark iron-type bottom foot.

4277
03:02:09.067 --> 03:02:11.050
TALIESIN: I'm going to just start making my way over there.

4278
03:02:11.050 --> 03:02:13.314
MARISHA: I follow Caduceus.
MATT: Okay.

4279
03:02:13.314 --> 03:02:16.617
"Ah, what are you doing here?

4280
03:02:16.617 --> 03:02:19.643
"We have not had visitors for some time,

4281
03:02:19.643 --> 03:02:23.053
"at least a few days, maybe."
LAURA: What are you doing here?

4282
03:02:23.053 --> 03:02:23.886
SAM: Days?

4283
03:02:23.886 --> 03:02:24.719
MATT: "Weeks. Months."

4284
03:02:24.719 --> 03:02:26.566
LAURA: Just a couple days.
SAM: Weeks?

4285
03:02:26.566 --> 03:02:28.723
MATT: "I'm kept here.

4286
03:02:28.723 --> 03:02:30.166
"What is you?

4287
03:02:30.166 --> 03:02:34.482
"What is you, pretty blue one?"
LAURA: What is you?

4288
03:02:37.374 --> 03:02:39.224
MATT: "I've been here for some time.

4289
03:02:39.224 --> 03:02:40.440
"The pesky time again.

4290
03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:41.981
"For some time, I imagine, I've been here."

4291
03:02:41.981 --> 03:02:43.995
TALIESIN: Going towards the door, and I'm

4292
03:02:43.995 --> 03:02:45.414
pulling the curtain to reveal.

4293
03:02:45.414 --> 03:02:46.760
MATT: Okay, as you see Caduceus doing this, revealing it,

4294
03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:49.689
its wings have now like filled the space,

4295
03:02:49.689 --> 03:02:51.904
the crackling, the barrier is now consistent,

4296
03:02:51.904 --> 03:02:54.059
you hear this (popping)

4297
03:02:54.059 --> 03:02:57.118
crackling sound as it's trying to push against it

4298
03:02:57.118 --> 03:02:58.784
as it's looking intently at all of you,

4299
03:02:58.784 --> 03:03:01.959
its head twitching and shifting around to each of you.

4300
03:03:01.959 --> 03:03:05.078
It seems to be hungry to take in all the information

4301
03:03:05.078 --> 03:03:07.554
of what surrounds it, and the fact that there

4302
03:03:07.554 --> 03:03:09.497
seem to be people wandering through the chamber.

4303
03:03:11.331 --> 03:03:15.321
"So what have you come? Bring companionship?

4304
03:03:15.321 --> 03:03:20.321
"Questions? What do you bring me, why are you here?"

4305
03:03:20.702 --> 03:03:22.439
TALIESIN: I'm opening the door.

4306
03:03:22.439 --> 03:03:24.277
MATT: It doesn't open.

4307
03:03:24.277 --> 03:03:25.431
MARISHA: Fuck.

4308
03:03:25.431 --> 03:03:27.636
TRAVIS: Does it have a keyhole?

4309
03:03:27.636 --> 03:03:28.867
I'm not there.

4310
03:03:28.867 --> 03:03:32.062
SAM: Lassy, Lassy, how do you open the door?

4311
03:03:32.062 --> 03:03:34.367
MATT: (as Halas) "I need to open it."

4312
03:03:34.367 --> 03:03:35.988
SAM: What do you mean you need to open it?

4313
03:03:35.988 --> 03:03:38.469
TRAVIS: Oh fucking shit.
LAURA: That's what he was saying.

4314
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:40.207
SAM: Your body needs to open it?

4315
03:03:40.207 --> 03:03:42.387
MATT: "Well, I have means of opening doors.

4316
03:03:42.387 --> 03:03:46.816
"I built everything to work based on the certain skills

4317
03:03:46.816 --> 03:03:49.839
"and magical crafts that I have."
LIAM: I will go join Caduceus at the door.

4318
03:03:49.839 --> 03:03:51.997
SAM: We'll go over there as well. What?

4319
03:03:51.997 --> 03:03:53.429
TRAVIS: I'll walk over to the devil.
MATT: Okay.

4320
03:03:53.429 --> 03:03:55.078
LAURA: Me too, I'm right here.

4321
03:03:55.078 --> 03:03:57.995
SAM: I'm going to whip out some tools and start seeing

4322
03:03:57.995 --> 03:03:59.452
if there's a lock.
MATT: Okay.

4323
03:03:59.452 --> 03:04:03.818
(as Devil) "Would you, friendly speaking ones,

4324
03:04:03.818 --> 03:04:08.485
"ones so full of honor and respect and words,

4325
03:04:08.485 --> 03:04:11.906
"so full of words, please check and see

03:04:11.906 --> 03:04:16.906
"if there is a green tome on that shelf for me, please?"

4327
03:04:17.182 --> 03:04:19.014
TRAVIS: What's your name?

4328
03:04:19.014 --> 03:04:22.147
MATT: "I do not recall.

4329
03:04:22.147 --> 03:04:23.422
"It has been too long.

4330
03:04:23.422 --> 03:04:26.157
"My name, I have lost my name. Perhaps it's in that book."

4331
03:04:26.157 --> 03:04:29.338
LAURA: Are you just in here with no books and no anything,

4332
03:04:29.338 --> 03:04:31.228
you're just in this little circle?

4333
03:04:31.228 --> 03:04:33.660
MATT: "For a long time, time immeasurable.

4334
03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:35.331
"Time, it's a word that keeps happening.

4335
03:04:35.331 --> 03:04:36.743
"What is it about this word 'time'?

4336
03:04:36.743 --> 03:04:40.764
"And you, time and time again, we say the word time!"

4337
03:04:40.764 --> 03:04:42.764
TRAVIS: Do you remember Halas?

4338
03:04:43.843 --> 03:04:46.993
MATT: (hissing) "Halas."

4339
03:04:46.993 --> 03:04:49.575
You see now, the muscles tense for a second,

4340
03:04:49.575 --> 03:04:52.707
and now the wings push intensely against

4341
03:04:52.707 --> 03:04:55.460
the outside of the barrier.

4342
03:04:55.460 --> 03:04:59.010
"That tricksy bastard

4343
03:04:59.010 --> 03:05:01.939
"and his tricksy circle!"

4344
03:05:01.939 --> 03:05:04.483
He pushes even harder again, it just flashes brighter,

4345
03:05:04.483 --> 03:05:07.600
and the arms recoil a bit from it.

4346
03:05:07.600 --> 03:05:10.308
"His tricksy questions,

4347
03:05:10.308 --> 03:05:15.308
"and his tricksy tricks."

4348
03:05:15.728 --> 03:05:17.350
LIAM: I'm at the door, but where are these books

4349
03:05:17.350 --> 03:05:18.503
that he referred to?

4350
03:05:18.503 --> 03:05:22.562
MATT: "Oh, how sweet and tasty his soul would be,

4351
03:05:22.562 --> 03:05:25.719
"would've been, had it been brought here.

4352
03:05:25.719 --> 03:05:30.719
"I almost had it, almost had it."

4353
03:05:31.159 --> 03:05:33.740
TRAVIS: You almost had what?
LAURA: His soul?

4354
03:05:33.740 --> 03:05:34.884
MATT: "His soul.

4355
03:05:34.884 --> 03:05:39.884
"Halas has made many deals with many devils.

4356
03:05:40.163 --> 03:05:44.404
"But he's weaseled out of every contract.

03:05:45.365 --> 03:05:49.244
"He is a prize, that one.

4358
03:05:49.244 --> 03:05:53.631
"Sought after by even the highest in the Hells.

4359
03:05:53.631 --> 03:05:58.631
"It would be so tasty."

4360
03:06:01.502 --> 03:06:04.545
You get the sense this devil's a little crazy.

4361
03:06:04.545 --> 03:06:07.370
TRAVIS: What does Halas keep you here for?

4362
03:06:07.370 --> 03:06:09.989
What have you done for him?

4363
03:06:09.989 --> 03:06:12.979
MATT: "Well, I have him with granted insights,

4364
03:06:12.979 --> 03:06:14.932
"I have granted him with gifts,

"I said, he's tricksy."

4370
03:06:35.935 --> 03:06:37.466
LIAM: You mentioned a green tome.

4371
03:06:37.466 --> 03:06:39.275
There's books on the wall here?

4372
03:06:39.275 --> 03:06:41.675
MATT: "There.

4373
03:06:41.675 --> 03:06:43.215
"You like books?"

4374
03:06:43.215 --> 03:06:45.360
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, I was thinking that in Zemnian.

4375
03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:47.558
I'm at the door, but I heard the mention of the tome.

4376
03:06:47.558 --> 03:06:48.391
MATT: Oh.

4377
03:06:48.391 --> 03:06:50.374
LIAM: So there's lots of books on the wall, or just--

4378
03:06:50.374 --> 03:06:53.578
MATT: Not a lot, like, maybe four on a shelf across the way

4379
03:06:53.578 --> 03:06:55.992
from near where you guys entered to the right.

4380
03:06:55.992 --> 03:06:58.389
LIAM: All right, so eyes on that, but also on the door,

4381
03:06:58.389 --> 03:07:00.457
and Nott was tinkering?

4382
03:07:00.457 --> 03:07:03.118
SAM: I'm just going to see if it's locked
or if it's magical, or--

4383
03:07:03.118 --> 03:07:04.883
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4384
03:07:06.433 --> 03:07:07.558
SAM: 23.

4385
03:07:07.558 --> 03:07:11.533
MATT: 23. The door is locked and it is trapped.

4386
03:07:11.533 --> 03:07:12.366
SAM: Okay.

4387
03:07:13.518 --> 03:07:17.025
I guess I'll start untrapping it, or attempt to.

4388
03:07:17.025 --> 03:07:19.197
LAURA: Do you remember Halas ever coming through here

4389
03:07:19.197 --> 03:07:21.964
and going into this door right here?

4390
03:07:21.964 --> 03:07:23.422
MATT: "What?"

4391
03:07:23.422 --> 03:07:24.775
LAURA: This door?

4392
03:07:24.775 --> 03:07:26.194
MATT: "This door?"
LAURA: Yes.

4393
03:07:26.194 --> 03:07:27.230
MATT: "A few times.

4394
03:07:27.230 --> 03:07:32.185
"Other things come through, big things, collared things,

4395
03:07:32.185 --> 03:07:34.852
"things brought through the door."

4396
03:07:36.843 --> 03:07:39.585
LAURA: Do you remember how they opened it?

4397
03:07:39.585 --> 03:07:42.402
MATT: "The golems open the door.

4398
03:07:43.696 --> 03:07:45.037
"It opened for them."

4399
03:07:45.037 --> 03:07:47.204
LAURA: Maybe Willi can open it.

4400
03:07:49.441 --> 03:07:52.802
SAM: I try to disarm the trap.

4401
03:07:52.802 --> 03:07:54.709
I rolled a 22.

4402
03:07:54.709 --> 03:07:55.920
MATT: A 22?

4403
03:07:55.920 --> 03:07:58.608
SAM: That's not that great down here.

4404
03:07:58.608 --> 03:08:01.106
MATT: You fiddle with it for a while and realize

4405
03:08:01.106 --> 03:08:04.755
the nature of this trap is not a contraption

4406
03:08:04.755 --> 03:08:06.547
that can be disabled via the tools

4407
03:08:06.547 --> 03:08:08.474
you have at your disposal.

4408
03:08:10.099 --> 03:08:13.127
SAM: Do I sense that it's magical or it's mechanical?

4409
03:08:13.127 --> 03:08:14.156
Or both.

4410
03:08:14.156 --> 03:08:15.931
MATT: It's both, mostly magical.

4411
03:08:15.931 --> 03:08:17.446
SAM: Okay.

4412
03:08:17.446 --> 03:08:19.387
TALIESIN: We try maybe.

4413
03:08:19.387 --> 03:08:20.518
LIAM: Yeah, mm-hmm.

4414
03:08:21.551 --> 03:08:23.667
But I have wandered over to look closer

4415
03:08:23.667 --> 03:08:25.572
at the books on the shelf.

4416
03:08:25.572 --> 03:08:26.581
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4417
03:08:26.581 --> 03:08:28.497
LIAM: There are three or four?
MATT: Yeah.

4418
03:08:28.497 --> 03:08:31.869
LIAM: I don't want to touch, but do they have
any writing or markings on them?

4419
03:08:31.869 --> 03:08:33.250
MATT: No binding on them.

4420
03:08:33.250 --> 03:08:34.138
LIAM: No binding.

4421
03:08:34.138 --> 03:08:36.002
MATT: I'm sorry, no like--
LIAM: No words.

4422
03:08:36.002 --> 03:08:37.027
MATT: No words on the binding.

4423
03:08:37.027 --> 03:08:39.496
LIAM: Right, and one of them is green, as this thing--

4424
03:08:39.496 --> 03:08:40.679
MATT: Correct.

4425
03:08:40.679 --> 03:08:42.862
LIAM: I'm not touching that one.

4426
03:08:42.862 --> 03:08:45.512
MATT: As you're walking towards the books,
you see the creature

4427
03:08:45.512 --> 03:08:48.276
looks excitedly in your direction.

4428
03:08:48.276 --> 03:08:53.276
"Ah, that one, that one, fourth page in, I believe.

4429
03:08:53.578 --> 03:08:57.484
"I left you a present there, a little poem.

4430
03:08:57.484 --> 03:08:59.119
"You'll like it.

4431
03:08:59.119 --> 03:09:01.487
"You'll like it."

4432
03:09:01.487 --> 03:09:06.487
LAURA: I'm going to cast Zone of Truth, over the demon.

4433
03:09:06.525 --> 03:09:08.073
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: The devil.

4434
03:09:08.073 --> 03:09:09.092
MATT: All right.

4435
03:09:09.092 --> 03:09:10.817
TRAVIS: I think they're immune, aren't they?

4436
03:09:10.817 --> 03:09:11.650
SAM: We'll find out.

4437
03:09:11.650 --> 03:09:14.297
TALIESIN: Pretty sure.
LIAM: Because she'll know.

4438
03:09:14.297 --> 03:09:15.654
MATT: Okay, and what's the DC?

4439
03:09:15.654 --> 03:09:18.214
LAURA: 17.
MATT: 17?

4440
03:09:18.214 --> 03:09:21.350
LAURA: He's crazy, maybe his charisma's low now.

4441
03:09:21.350 --> 03:09:23.879
MATT: No, it works.

4442
03:09:23.879 --> 03:09:24.781
LAURA: It works?

4443
03:09:24.781 --> 03:09:26.013
MARISHA: The spell worked?

4444
03:09:26.013 --> 03:09:27.846
LIAM: Yeah, he's truthful.

4445
03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:32.658
LAURA: What should I ask him?

4446
03:09:32.658 --> 03:09:34.024
TALIESIN: His name.
LIAM: What do you want to ask him?

4447
03:09:34.024 --> 03:09:35.366
SAM: How to get in.

4448
03:09:35.366 --> 03:09:38.505
LAURA: You really don't remember how to get into that room?

4449
03:09:38.505 --> 03:09:39.843
MATT: "I don't, it's been a while.

4450
03:09:39.843 --> 03:09:43.427
"I was not granted with all of the knowledge of Halas,

4451
03:09:43.427 --> 03:09:45.360
"just the bits I tried

4452
03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:47.114
"to take to turn on him."
TRAVIS: Will any of those books hurt our friend

4453
03:09:47.114 --> 03:09:49.142
if he touches them?

4454
03:09:49.142 --> 03:09:51.424
LIAM: Will this book unleash you?

4455
03:09:51.424 --> 03:09:53.089
MATT: "This book."

4456
03:09:53.089 --> 03:09:55.176
LIAM: This green one that I'm not touching?

4457
03:09:55.176 --> 03:09:58.728
MATT: "That green one is a special one to me."

4458
03:09:58.728 --> 03:10:00.575
LIAM: Will it let you out?

4459
03:10:00.575 --> 03:10:02.098
MATT: "It's a special one to me."

4460
03:10:02.098 --> 03:10:03.797
TRAVIS: (laughing skeptically) Yeah.

4461
03:10:03.797 --> 03:10:05.661
LAURA: What does it do?

4462
03:10:05.661 --> 03:10:08.042
MATT: "It contains a poem."

4463
03:10:08.042 --> 03:10:09.520
LAURA: What kind of poem?

4464
03:10:09.520 --> 03:10:13.183
MATT: "A poem that's written in my language."

4465
03:10:13.183 --> 03:10:15.762
LAURA: What does the poem say?

4466
03:10:15.762 --> 03:10:18.288
MATT: "I cannot say it.

4467
03:10:18.288 --> 03:10:21.538
"It's a gift for others."

4468
03:10:23.456 --> 03:10:25.197
TALIESIN: What's your name?

4469
03:10:25.197 --> 03:10:29.081
MATT: "I don't know my name."

4470
03:10:29.989 --> 03:10:31.063
TALIESIN: Wow.

4471
03:10:31.063 --> 03:10:32.560
LIAM: Let him rot a little bit longer.

4472
03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:34.310
I return to the door.

4473
03:10:35.974 --> 03:10:39.592
TRAVIS: Will any of these books hurt us if we touch them?

4474
03:10:39.592 --> 03:10:40.961
MATT: "No, they help.

4475
03:10:40.961 --> 03:10:42.239
"The green one helps.

4476
03:10:42.239 --> 03:10:43.623
"The poem helps."

4477
03:10:43.623 --> 03:10:44.881
TRAVIS: What about the other ones?

4478
03:10:44.881 --> 03:10:46.686
MATT: "I don't care for the others."

4479
03:10:46.686 --> 03:10:47.689
TRAVIS: Will they hurt us?

4480
03:10:47.689 --> 03:10:50.004
MATT: "I don't know what's in those books.

4481
03:10:50.004 --> 03:10:52.562
"The green one's the one that's...

4482
03:10:52.562 --> 03:10:54.585
"f-f-fun."

4483
03:10:54.585 --> 03:10:57.590
SAM: (laughing)

4484
03:10:57.590 --> 03:11:01.943
LIAM: I speak a single arcane word
and cast Knock on the door.

4485
03:11:01.943 --> 03:11:03.310
MATT: Okay.

4486
03:11:03.310 --> 03:11:06.545
Roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

4487
03:11:06.545 --> 03:11:08.158
SAM: Ooh.

4488
03:11:08.158 --> 03:11:10.825
LIAM: That's been rolling real well.

4489
03:11:11.864 --> 03:11:13.365
That is 26.

4490
03:11:14.648 --> 03:11:17.621
MATT: Boom, you hear this heavy impact knocking sound,

4491
03:11:17.621 --> 03:11:21.653
like someone had taken a giant hammer to a metal door.

4492
03:11:21.653 --> 03:11:24.441
And with that-- (clicking)
(gasping)

4493
03:11:24.441 --> 03:11:26.297
(creaks)
SAM: (gasps)

4494
03:11:26.297 --> 03:11:30.241
MATT: The door opens, trap also
seemingly disabled at the same time.

4495
03:11:30.241 --> 03:11:31.632
ALL: Oh!

4496
03:11:35.837 --> 03:11:37.747
SAM: Hand out the paper.

4497
03:11:37.747 --> 03:11:39.463
TRAVIS: We already did, yeah.
SAM: Okay.

4498
03:11:39.463 --> 03:11:41.096
MATT: "Where are you going?"
SAM: Teach me how to read and write.

4499
03:11:41.096 --> 03:11:44.490
Just kidding, I'm very smart.
MATT: "Where are you going?

4500
03:11:44.490 --> 03:11:47.558
"Don't go in there, things don't come back from there,

4501
03:11:47.558 --> 03:11:51.912
"you won't come back, I need your help to bring me

4502
03:11:51.912 --> 03:11:54.027
"the poem and read it for me."

4503
03:11:54.027 --> 03:11:55.174
Are you guys leaving?

4504
03:11:55.174 --> 03:11:56.539
TRAVIS: We're walking towards the door.

4505
03:11:56.539 --> 03:11:58.300
SAM: Just quickly read the poem.

4506
03:11:58.300 --> 03:11:59.214
LIAM: No.

4507
03:11:59.214 --> 03:12:00.749
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

4508
03:12:00.749 --> 03:12:03.625
LAURA: I might read it to you if you tell me what it does.

4509
03:12:03.625 --> 03:12:07.296
MATT: "I need someone to read it for me

4510
03:12:07.296 --> 03:12:10.213
"so I could remember things."

4511
03:12:12.638 --> 03:12:14.638
LAURA: I feel so bad for him.

4512
03:12:16.573 --> 03:12:20.177
TALIESIN: Can we block the door so it doesn't shut?

4513
03:12:20.177 --> 03:12:22.760
SAM: I can, if it's got a keyhole.

4514
03:12:24.199 --> 03:12:26.613
Well, lock it so it doesn't shut?

4515
03:12:26.613 --> 03:12:28.411
TRAVIS: No, block it.
SAM: Oh, block it.

4516
03:12:28.411 --> 03:12:29.955
LIAM: Yeah, and what do we see beyond the door?

4517
03:12:29.955 --> 03:12:33.767
Because so many passages here are dimensional warps.

4518
03:12:33.767 --> 03:12:37.132
MATT: Beyond this, this has a set of stairs, it looks like,

4519
03:12:37.132 --> 03:12:40.436
that descend downward about 100 or so feet,

4520
03:12:40.436 --> 03:12:42.962
where you see another door, or door frame.

4521
03:12:42.962 --> 03:12:45.314
You're not able to see much beyond that.

4522
03:12:45.314 --> 03:12:49.027
TRAVIS: Walls on either side of the steps, or just space?

4523
03:12:49.027 --> 03:12:49.860
MATT: Open space.

4524
03:12:49.860 --> 03:12:51.151
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's the best.

4525
03:12:51.151 --> 03:12:53.626
Makes me want to fucking shit my pants.

4526
03:12:53.626 --> 03:12:54.934
(shudders)

4527
03:12:54.934 --> 03:12:56.341
Terrible.

4528
03:12:56.341 --> 03:12:58.388
MARISHA: That was in your Spooktacular.

4529
03:12:58.388 --> 03:13:00.838
Open space, open space.

4530
03:13:03.631 --> 03:13:06.184
LIAM: I think we should move on.

4531
03:13:06.184 --> 03:13:08.288
TRAVIS: Good to move?
MATT: "Where are you going?"

4532
03:13:08.288 --> 03:13:09.913
TRAVIS: We'll be back.

4533
03:13:09.913 --> 03:13:12.942
MATT: "Back soon, please don't leave me."

4534
03:13:12.942 --> 03:13:15.080
LIAM: We are just going to get some help.
MATT: "Don't--"

4535
03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:16.237
TALIESIN: Time is relative.

4536
03:13:16.237 --> 03:13:21.107
MATT: "--leave me! Time! Time! Ah, it's that word again."

4537
03:13:21.107 --> 03:13:22.751
TRAVIS: I'll go through the door and down the stairs.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4538
03:13:22.751 --> 03:13:23.768
MARISHA: I follow Fjord.

4539
03:13:23.768 --> 03:13:25.225
LAURA: Right as I'm leaving, I sing him

4540
03:13:25.225 --> 03:13:28.692
♪ The Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever ♪

4541
03:13:28.692 --> 03:13:31.076
Just so he has a little ditty to hum as we--

4542
03:13:31.076 --> 03:13:32.227
MATT: There's like a pause.

4543
03:13:32.227 --> 03:13:33.519
(devil laughs)

4544
03:13:33.519 --> 03:13:35.223
"That's a good one."

4545
03:13:35.223 --> 03:13:37.715
TRAVIS: Did you tell the horned devil
the name of your mother?

4546
03:13:37.715 --> 03:13:40.647
LAURA: It's not her real name.

4547
03:13:40.647 --> 03:13:42.449
TALIESIN: I'm going to give myself something to chew on

4548
03:13:42.449 --> 03:13:44.562
so I don't speak.

4549
03:13:44.562 --> 03:13:47.136
LAURA: Oh, that's a real good idea.

4550
03:13:47.136 --> 03:13:49.018
This is going to be really hard, you guys.

4551
03:13:49.018 --> 03:13:50.328
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

4552
03:13:50.328 --> 03:13:54.638
MARISHA: I take my belt, off of that idea,

4553
03:13:54.638 --> 03:13:57.178
and I tie it around my mouth.

4554
03:13:57.178 --> 03:14:00.009
TALIESIN: Also before we go in, I'm going to cast Light,

4555
03:14:00.009 --> 03:14:03.501
and I'm also going to cast--

4556
03:14:05.669 --> 03:14:07.861
ba doo ba doo.
MATT: ♪ Do doo, do do doo. ♪

4557
03:14:07.861 --> 03:14:10.540
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Mahna Mahna.

4558
03:14:10.540 --> 03:14:13.092
Disguise Self to look like Halas.

4559
03:14:13.092 --> 03:14:14.510
TRAVIS: Does that stay up, though?

4560
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:15.570
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's just on.

4561
03:14:15.570 --> 03:14:16.896
TRAVIS: Is that not a spell that--

4562
03:14:16.896 --> 03:14:18.107
LAURA: This is very low level.

4563
03:14:18.107 --> 03:14:19.162
SAM: It's a low level spell.

4564
03:14:19.162 --> 03:14:20.666
TALIESIN: It's before we're going in.

4565
03:14:20.666 --> 03:14:21.512
TRAVIS: Okay.

4566
03:14:21.512 --> 03:14:23.419
It's not going to be attracted to the spell, right?

4567
03:14:23.419 --> 03:14:25.643
TALIESIN: It's literally something--

4568
03:14:25.643 --> 03:14:28.460
I can biologically do it.

4569
03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:29.891
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: All right.

4570
03:14:29.891 --> 03:14:31.579
TALIESIN: It's not even a spell slot.

4571
03:14:31.579 --> 03:14:32.512
MATT: You descend the stairs.

4572
03:14:32.512 --> 03:14:34.520
Can I have a marching order, please?

4573
03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:36.342
TRAVIS: I guess I'm in the front.

4574
03:14:36.342 --> 03:14:37.175
MATT: Fjord in the front.

4575
03:14:37.175 --> 03:14:38.664
MARISHA: Behind Fjord.
MATT: Beauregard.

4576
03:14:38.664 --> 03:14:40.347
TALIESIN: I'll be behind Beau.
MATT: All right.

4577
03:14:40.347 --> 03:14:42.092
LAURA: I'll go last because I was singing him the song.

4578
03:14:42.092 --> 03:14:45.135
SAM: Is Willi carrying the body?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4579
03:14:45.135 --> 03:14:46.888
LAURA: I thought Caduceus was carrying the body.

4580
03:14:46.888 --> 03:14:48.978
TALIESIN: Willi's got the body.

4581
03:14:48.978 --> 03:14:51.426
LIAM: Wouldn't be good if Halas was carrying Halas.

4582
03:14:51.426 --> 03:14:54.092
SAM: Oh, yeah, no.

4583
03:14:54.092 --> 03:14:58.259
MATT: Fjord's in the front, Beau's after Fjord.

4584
03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:00.766
SAM: Put me anywhere.

4585
03:15:00.766 --> 03:15:02.749
MATT: Nott's in the middle.

4586
03:15:02.749 --> 03:15:03.759
Jester, where are you, again?

4587
03:15:03.759 --> 03:15:05.463
LAURA: I'm in the back.
MATT: You're in the back.

4588
03:15:05.463 --> 03:15:08.138
So that means Caduceus and Caleb are with the rear.

4589
03:15:08.138 --> 03:15:11.740
LIAM: Yeah, I held back with Willi and Jester.

4590
03:15:11.740 --> 03:15:12.573
MATT: Okay.

4591
03:15:12.573 --> 03:15:14.730
So I'll put Willi back there with you guys.

4592
03:15:14.730 --> 03:15:15.938
You got it, okay.

4593
03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:18.946
So...

4594
03:15:18.946 --> 03:15:20.337
as you descend the staircase,

4595
03:15:20.337 --> 03:15:23.468
it's a very weird feeling here, being able to look off--

4596
03:15:23.468 --> 03:15:25.711
and it's not just blackness, you can see distant stars,

4597
03:15:25.711 --> 03:15:29.212
and as such it feels, as you're about halfway there,

4598
03:15:29.212 --> 03:15:32.984
you begin losing sense of up and down almost.

4599
03:15:32.984 --> 03:15:35.283
You're not sure if it's rotating or not.

4600
03:15:35.283 --> 03:15:36.779
You can see slight shifting of the stars

4601
03:15:36.779 --> 03:15:39.083
and begin to feel yourself leaning to one side,

4602
03:15:39.083 --> 03:15:41.325
which begins to throw you off-balance,

4603
03:15:41.325 --> 03:15:43.287
and you have to get low and hold onto the stone.

4604
03:15:43.287 --> 03:15:46.253
It's like going across a very very high, very thin bridge,

4605
03:15:46.253 --> 03:15:49.478
and it leaves you feeling really uncomfortable.

4606
03:15:49.478 --> 03:15:52.387
You come to the bottom of the stairs, and one by one enter,

4607
03:15:52.387 --> 03:15:55.346
emerging from this doorway portal,

4608
03:15:55.346 --> 03:15:57.874
and you arrive in a cold dark room that is circular,

4609
03:15:57.874 --> 03:16:00.469
about 60 feet across, and seemingly crafted

4610
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:03.466
from a dark, slate-colored brushed steel

4611
03:16:03.466 --> 03:16:07.082
that forms the walls in this cylindrical chamber

4612
03:16:07.082 --> 03:16:09.429
between a granite floor and the ceiling.

4613
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:11.928
A single, wide staircase seems to descend

4614
03:16:11.928 --> 03:16:15.011
from the other side of the chamber from where you entered,

4615
03:16:15.011 --> 03:16:17.595
from your current position, while two low flickering torches

4616
03:16:17.595 --> 03:16:20.329
burn on the left and right sides of the room.

4617
03:16:20.329 --> 03:16:22.239
Other than that, it's blank.

4618
03:16:22.239 --> 03:16:24.384
LAURA: Do we see anything going up?

4619
03:16:24.384 --> 03:16:26.210
MATT: Nope, but you look up and you see

4620
03:16:26.210 --> 03:16:28.312
a familiar stone relief, similar to the one you saw

4621
03:16:28.312 --> 03:16:30.431
in that first chamber you arrived,

4622
03:16:30.431 --> 03:16:33.531
of the mage hunter golem, currently sealed

4623
03:16:33.531 --> 03:16:37.581
and held in stasis about 40 feet in the air above you.

4624
03:16:38.704 --> 03:16:42.364
TRAVIS: I will mush into Nott and stealthily

4625
03:16:42.364 --> 03:16:44.928
point towards the stairs, the top

4626
03:16:44.928 --> 03:16:46.691
of the descending staircase.

4627
03:16:46.691 --> 03:16:51.671
SAM: Okay, I'll scurry forward and scan for any traps.

4628
03:16:52.671 --> 03:16:54.979
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4629
03:16:54.979 --> 03:16:56.883
Investigation or perception, because--

4630
03:16:56.883 --> 03:16:58.144
SAM: 19.

4631
03:16:58.144 --> 03:16:59.739
MATT: 19?

4632
03:16:59.739 --> 03:17:02.161
No traps, just stairs that head further down.

4633
03:17:02.161 --> 03:17:04.882
SAM: All right, I'll start down the stairs.

4634
03:17:04.882 --> 03:17:06.445
MATT: Okay, you guys follow?

4635
03:17:06.445 --> 03:17:07.351
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

4636
03:17:07.351 --> 03:17:08.305
MATT: All right.

4637
03:17:08.305 --> 03:17:10.217
Heading down to the second floor,

4638
03:17:10.217 --> 03:17:12.210
the stairs continue downward, and where you would assume

4639
03:17:12.210 --> 03:17:14.585
a tower would be, you know, a spiral staircase,

4640
03:17:14.585 --> 03:17:17.147
this just goes down and down and down,

4641
03:17:17.147 --> 03:17:18.981
and the circular chamber that you enter again

4642
03:17:18.981 --> 03:17:21.667
is at an angle, and there's now across the way

4643
03:17:21.667 --> 03:17:25.222
a mirrored set of stairs that continues further down

4644
03:17:25.222 --> 03:17:28.161
to another floor at this angle.

4645
03:17:28.161 --> 03:17:32.514
However, this chamber is even colder than the previous one,

4646
03:17:32.514 --> 03:17:34.653
and the air itself seems heavier.

4647
03:17:34.653 --> 03:17:37.501
Breathing is slightly more labored, thick,

4648
03:17:37.501 --> 03:17:40.531
like there's a lot of moisture, but there isn't.

4649
03:17:40.531 --> 03:17:44.041
The room is similar in shape, makeup to the previous,

4650
03:17:44.041 --> 03:17:47.180
though an odd stack of heavy duty cases and chests

4651
03:17:47.180 --> 03:17:51.104
made of a solid dark material are clustered

4652
03:17:51.104 --> 03:17:52.678
to the right and left sides of the chamber,

4653
03:17:52.678 --> 03:17:54.796
where the torches were previously.

4654
03:17:55.971 --> 03:17:57.248
Your eyes now begin to focus

4655
03:17:57.248 --> 03:17:59.461
on the space around you now, from the firelight

4656
03:17:59.461 --> 03:18:02.724
that's flickering, and the air itself around you,

4657
03:18:02.724 --> 03:18:06.670
you can see carries tiny near-invisible particles,

4658
03:18:06.670 --> 03:18:07.503
like dust.

4659
03:18:08.879 --> 03:18:11.929
Inhaling doesn't cause the particles to move near you

4660
03:18:11.929 --> 03:18:14.623
or away from you when you exhale.

4661
03:18:14.623 --> 03:18:17.258
Moving your hands displaces them,

4662
03:18:17.258 --> 03:18:20.508
but the air doesn't seem to shift them.

4663
03:18:22.100 --> 03:18:25.729
LAURA: I'm going to write down: "Ooh, ooh!

4664
03:18:25.729 --> 03:18:28.253
"I bet that those chests hold all the stuff

4665
03:18:28.253 --> 03:18:31.105
"that people have gotten taken away from them!"

4666
03:18:32.880 --> 03:18:36.253
SAM: I'll point to it and give a thumbs up. (laughs)

4667
03:18:37.770 --> 03:18:39.287
LAURA: "Go steal it."

4668
03:18:40.300 --> 03:18:43.383
SAM: I show it to the rest of the group.

4669
03:18:46.689 --> 03:18:49.985
SAM: Okay, I'll go over and pick a lock on the box.

4670
03:18:49.985 --> 03:18:50.843
MATT: Okay.

4671
03:18:50.843 --> 03:18:52.229
You approach them, as you get close, you can see

4672
03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:56.632
they're all of a deep, deep jet black material,

4673
03:18:56.632 --> 03:18:59.551
and as you get close, you can see
the sheen on them is slightly greenish.

4674
03:18:59.551 --> 03:19:00.384
LAURA: Hmm.

4675
03:19:00.384 --> 03:19:02.374
MATT: It's actually the same material that you saw

4676
03:19:02.374 --> 03:19:05.224
some of the golem ingots that you had there,

4677
03:19:05.224 --> 03:19:09.803
and you saw the heavy door in the King's Cage

4678
03:19:09.803 --> 03:19:11.905
was made from, adamantine.

4679
03:19:11.905 --> 03:19:14.865
So they are pretty heavy duty boxes.

4680
03:19:14.865 --> 03:19:15.698
SAM: Ew.

4681
03:19:15.698 --> 03:19:17.845
MATT: But they are locked.

4682
03:19:17.845 --> 03:19:19.002
SAM: I'll try to pick one.

4683
03:19:19.002 --> 03:19:22.210
MATT: Go for it, make a lockpicking check.

4684
03:19:22.210 --> 03:19:25.218
SAM: What is that? (laughs)

4685
03:19:25.218 --> 03:19:26.444
MATT: What are you doing, Nott?

4686
03:19:26.444 --> 03:19:29.607
SAM: I'm going to try to pick it,
I don't know what that means.

4687
03:19:29.607 --> 03:19:31.935
LIAM: I write down--
MARISHA: Check for traps.

4688
03:19:31.935 --> 03:19:33.359
LIAM: "Traps, brah."

4689
03:19:33.359 --> 03:19:34.785
MARISHA: (laughs)

4690
03:19:34.785 --> 03:19:36.245
MATT: What'd you roll?

4691
03:19:36.245 --> 03:19:37.262
SAM: 19.

4692
03:19:37.262 --> 03:19:38.771
MATT: A 19. (clicking)

4693
03:19:38.771 --> 03:19:40.395
MARISHA: I got what you were doing.

4694
03:19:40.395 --> 03:19:43.178
TALIESIN: I'm going to start backing up from this.
LAURA: Yeah, back up, we all back up.

4695
03:19:43.178 --> 03:19:44.175
MATT: Okay.

4696
03:19:44.175 --> 03:19:47.205
LIAM: Caleb gesticulating madly, just trying to show

4697
03:19:47.205 --> 03:19:50.103
explosions with his hands.

4698
03:19:50.103 --> 03:19:53.377
MATT: Okay, you-- (clicking)

4699
03:19:53.377 --> 03:19:54.377
(ting)

4700
03:19:54.377 --> 03:19:56.764
It doesn't unlock.

4701
03:19:56.764 --> 03:19:58.356
SAM: Oh.

4702
03:19:58.356 --> 03:20:01.101
MATT: Um. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

4703
03:20:01.101 --> 03:20:04.126
(laughter)

4704
03:20:04.126 --> 03:20:05.410
SAM: Eight.

4705
03:20:05.410 --> 03:20:06.835
No, 11.

4706
03:20:10.452 --> 03:20:11.523
MATT: (heavy sigh)

4707
03:20:11.523 --> 03:20:12.649
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

4708
03:20:12.649 --> 03:20:14.157
SAM: Oh no.

4709
03:20:14.157 --> 03:20:16.159
MARISHA: Is this going to be like a Vex'ahlia moment?

4710
03:20:16.159 --> 03:20:16.992
MATT: Oh!

4711
03:20:17.950 --> 03:20:19.014
Hold on a second.

4712
03:20:19.014 --> 03:20:20.271
SAM: "Oh."

4713
03:20:20.271 --> 03:20:21.104
"Oh"?

4714
03:20:21.104 --> 03:20:23.062
TALIESIN: Can't heal you in here.

4715
03:20:23.062 --> 03:20:24.515
LAURA: Mm-mm.

4716
03:20:24.515 --> 03:20:26.778
We can feed him a potion. Her.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4717
03:20:26.778 --> 03:20:27.611
TRAVIS: Nope.

4718
03:20:28.811 --> 03:20:31.110
MATT: Sorry, my apologies, there is no saving throw.

4719
03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.943
SAM: Oh.

4720
03:20:34.226 --> 03:20:38.643
MATT: You watch as Nott is working at the box,

4721
03:20:38.643 --> 03:20:42.083
there's that click sound, and there's this kind of

4722
03:20:42.083 --> 03:20:44.493
bit of shadow that just-- (gasps)

4723
03:20:44.493 --> 03:20:49.135
drifts off of the body as Nott collapses.

4724
03:20:49.135 --> 03:20:51.602
MARISHA: Exact. Same. Shit.

4725
03:20:52.978 --> 03:20:56.547
Time is a flat circle.

4726
03:20:56.547 --> 03:21:00.467
MATT: The box also (poofs) vanishes.

4727
03:21:01.626 --> 03:21:04.876
LIAM: I drop down and start gently shaking.

4728
03:21:07.506 --> 03:21:08.839
MATT: No breath.

4729
03:21:08.839 --> 03:21:12.385
LIAM: I scoop her up and start quietly
going back up the stairs.

4730
03:21:12.385 --> 03:21:13.244
MARISHA: Yeah, we got to go back.

4731
03:21:13.244 --> 03:21:14.626
TALIESIN: I'll follow.
LAURA: Yeah, same, same.

4732
03:21:14.626 --> 03:21:17.329
MATT: All right, you guys back into the chamber.

4733
03:21:17.329 --> 03:21:19.444
(as Devil) "Back so soon?"

4734
03:21:19.444 --> 03:21:20.677
MARISHA: Shut up.

4735
03:21:21.874 --> 03:21:23.905
MATT: "What is problems?"

4736
03:21:23.905 --> 03:21:25.037
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying.

4737
03:21:25.037 --> 03:21:27.062
MATT: "Is she sleeping?"

4738
03:21:27.062 --> 03:21:29.797
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying.

4739
03:21:29.797 --> 03:21:31.250
MATT: It has no effect.

4740
03:21:31.250 --> 03:21:33.517
TALIESIN: I mean, it just is a--

4741
03:21:33.517 --> 03:21:34.908
it just, uh--

4742
03:21:34.908 --> 03:21:38.103
LAURA: Revivify, Revivify.
TALIESIN: It's a stability.

4743
03:21:38.103 --> 03:21:40.011
MATT: That's if they're at zero hit points.

4744
03:21:40.011 --> 03:21:40.860
TALIESIN: Oh.

4745
03:21:40.860 --> 03:21:42.961
MATT: Nott is not alive.

4746
03:21:42.961 --> 03:21:45.245
LAURA: Revivify, cast Revivify!

4747
03:21:47.023 --> 03:21:50.830
I have Revivify, I have a thing, I'm going to cast Revivify.

4748
03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:51.884
TALIESIN: You do the Revivify?

4749
03:21:51.884 --> 03:21:54.983
MATT: And you have the diamond?
LAURA: And I have the diamond.

4750
03:21:54.983 --> 03:21:56.480
Me and Caduceus both, he gave me one

4751
03:21:56.480 --> 03:21:57.873
right before we came in here.

4752
03:21:57.873 --> 03:21:58.706
MATT: Okay.

4753
03:21:58.706 --> 03:22:00.049
TALIESIN: Which diamond is it, just to be sure

4754
03:22:00.049 --> 03:22:02.213
we're burning the right one?

4755
03:22:02.213 --> 03:22:05.113
Because we can do the fast one,
because it's been real quick.

4756
03:22:06.133 --> 03:22:07.285
MATT: Okay.

4757
03:22:07.285 --> 03:22:08.946
TALIESIN: Which one's the fast one?

4758
03:22:08.946 --> 03:22:09.954
LAURA: 500 gold.

4759
03:22:09.954 --> 03:22:11.810
TALIESIN: Wait, no, you need the--
LAURA: Revivify.

4760
03:22:11.810 --> 03:22:13.288
TALIESIN: Revivify's the 500 gold one?

4761
03:22:13.288 --> 03:22:15.002
LAURA: Yeah, the 300 gold is for Revivify,

4762
03:22:15.002 --> 03:22:16.339
I don't give a fuck, I'm just using it.

4763
03:22:16.339 --> 03:22:18.273
TALIESIN: Well, I've got the 300, so yeah, we can go ahead,

4764
03:22:18.273 --> 03:22:21.066
yeah, and do it.
MATT: Okay.

4765
03:22:21.066 --> 03:22:23.573
A tense moment passes.

4766
03:22:23.573 --> 03:22:25.478
This is inside the Circlebound Chamber, correct?

4767
03:22:25.478 --> 03:22:27.561
SAM: You guys said to do it.

4768
03:22:28.617 --> 03:22:31.256
LAURA: Yeah, we didn't fully say
we were going back to the study,

4769
03:22:31.256 --> 03:22:32.791
so sure, it's in the Circlebound Chamber.

4770
03:22:32.791 --> 03:22:34.513
MATT: It's up to you, you can take him
in the study if you want.

4771
03:22:34.513 --> 03:22:37.650
LAURA: I don't-- if there's time,
because it has to be under a minute.

4772
03:22:37.650 --> 03:22:39.395
MATT: Has under a minute, so what would you do?

4773
03:22:39.395 --> 03:22:41.518
LAURA: I would just drop and do it in the Circlebound.

4774
03:22:41.518 --> 03:22:42.351
MARISHA: Yeah, I agree.

4775
03:22:42.351 --> 03:22:43.631
MATT: In the middle of this chamber,

4776
03:22:43.631 --> 03:22:46.945
beyond where the containment circle is,

4777
03:22:46.945 --> 03:22:51.444
you reach down, grasp the symbol of the Traveler,

4778
03:22:51.444 --> 03:22:54.807
and as you place the diamond onto the chest of Nott's

4779
03:22:54.807 --> 03:22:56.865
currently lifeless body,

4780
03:22:57.991 --> 03:23:00.307
you see the diamond crumple black

4781
03:23:00.307 --> 03:23:02.925
and turn to dust.
LAURA: No, no, no, no.

4782
03:23:02.925 --> 03:23:06.018
MATT: As the dust drifts away,

4783
03:23:06.018 --> 03:23:08.819
you see the hand of the Traveler

4784
03:23:08.819 --> 03:23:12.120
catch it in the air and then place it

4785
03:23:12.120 --> 03:23:15.128
onto the chest of Nott's body.

4786
03:23:16.775 --> 03:23:21.775
The hand gives one hard push on Nott's chest,

4787
03:23:21.945 --> 03:23:26.336
and in that moment, you watch Nott's body-- (gasps)

4788
03:23:26.336 --> 03:23:27.978
come back to consciousness.

4789
03:23:30.261 --> 03:23:31.375
TRAVIS: Oh man.

4790
03:23:31.375 --> 03:23:33.340
MARISHA: Check for traps.

4791
03:23:33.340 --> 03:23:36.013
SAM: That's what you were saying.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

4792
03:23:36.013 --> 03:23:38.018
It's what we tell you every time.

4793
03:23:38.018 --> 03:23:42.609
TRAVIS: Also, yeah, look, we're in
a terribly dangerous place.

4794
03:23:42.609 --> 03:23:44.448
Maybe we just look for Yussa.

4795
03:23:44.448 --> 03:23:46.422
SAM: That's fine.

4796
03:23:46.422 --> 03:23:48.740
LAURA: Check for traps all the time, okay?
SAM: Okay, okay.

4797
03:23:48.740 --> 03:23:51.678
MATT: The last thing you remember was trying to unlock it,

4798
03:23:51.678 --> 03:23:55.471
and then hearing a word or a phrase said in your head,

4799
03:23:55.471 --> 03:23:58.039
and you can't remember what it was.

4800
03:23:58.039 --> 03:24:00.317
But that's the last thing you remember.

4801
03:24:00.317 --> 03:24:01.186
It was strange.

4802
03:24:01.186 --> 03:24:02.545
SAM: A phrase.

4803
03:24:03.489 --> 03:24:05.623
(sighs)

4804
03:24:05.623 --> 03:24:07.370
LAURA: Halas.
SAM: Okay, okay.

4805
03:24:07.370 --> 03:24:09.227
LIAM: Do you still want what you want?

4806
03:24:09.227 --> 03:24:10.740
SAM: Yes.

4807
03:24:10.740 --> 03:24:11.987
LIAM: Well, don't do that!

4808
03:24:11.987 --> 03:24:13.767
SAM: Well, I'm sorry, I--

4809
03:24:13.767 --> 03:24:14.843
TRAVIS: It's all right, it's all right.

4810
03:24:14.843 --> 03:24:16.676
Glad to have you back.

4811
03:24:18.450 --> 03:24:19.950
LIAM: Check for traps.

4812
03:24:20.973 --> 03:24:23.259
SAM: All right, all right.

4813
03:24:23.259 --> 03:24:25.026
I will, I'm sorry.

4814
03:24:27.309 --> 03:24:28.754
TRAVIS: Shall we try again?

4815
03:24:28.754 --> 03:24:30.366
SAM: Mm-hmm.

4816
03:24:30.366 --> 03:24:31.199
MARISHA: Hey.

4817
03:24:31.199 --> 03:24:33.386
MATT: "Welcome back, welcome, welcome."
LAURA: Oh, hi.

4818
03:24:33.386 --> 03:24:34.587
LIAM: Hi, bye.

4819
03:24:34.587 --> 03:24:36.589
MATT: "Well saved.

4820
03:24:36.589 --> 03:24:39.314
"Quick on the draw you are.

4821
03:24:39.314 --> 03:24:41.403
"So you've come back, you said you'd come back

4822
03:24:41.403 --> 03:24:42.770
"and read me a poem."

4823
03:24:42.770 --> 03:24:44.946
SAM: Yeah, we're going to go again, sorry.

4824
03:24:44.946 --> 03:24:46.806
TRAVIS: Be right back, promise.

4825
03:24:46.806 --> 03:24:47.679
False start.

4826
03:24:47.679 --> 03:24:49.284
LIAM: Thought we left our keys, we didn't, we're good.

4827
03:24:49.284 --> 03:24:50.842
And I start down the stairs.

4828
03:24:50.842 --> 03:24:53.263
MATT: You guys just dart back out.

4829
03:24:53.263 --> 03:24:55.750
SAM: Do I have any hit points?

4830
03:24:55.750 --> 03:24:56.809
MATT: You have one hit point.

4831
03:24:56.809 --> 03:24:58.500
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Cool cool cool.

4832
03:25:01.257 --> 03:25:02.822
MARISHA: (laughs)

4833
03:25:02.822 --> 03:25:06.293
LAURA: Should we take an hour rest before we go back in?

4834
03:25:06.293 --> 03:25:07.945
MARISHA: That'd be good.

4835
03:25:07.945 --> 03:25:11.300
LIAM: Wouldn't be bad for me, in the study.

4836
03:25:11.300 --> 03:25:12.682
LAURA: (groans)

4837
03:25:12.682 --> 03:25:15.366
LIAM: Max security prison, <i>ja</i>.

4838
03:25:18.358 --> 03:25:20.936
LAURA: Let's go and rest for an hour

4839
03:25:20.936 --> 03:25:22.697
so Nott isn't at one hit point.

4840
03:25:22.697 --> 03:25:26.280
LIAM: Yeah, we're juggling time, but also
we're in a massive death trap.

4841
03:25:28.032 --> 03:25:29.701
SAM: Short rest, then?

4842
03:25:29.701 --> 03:25:31.194
LIAM: Yes, please.

4843
03:25:31.194 --> 03:25:32.663
MATT: So you're taking a short rest?

4844
03:25:32.663 --> 03:25:34.703
LAURA: In the study.
MARISHA: Okay.

4845
03:25:34.703 --> 03:25:36.754
MATT: Okay, that's another day.

4846
03:25:36.754 --> 03:25:38.850
MARISHA: That's another day.

4847
03:25:39.933 --> 03:25:41.216
LAURA: Just use them all.

4848
03:25:41.216 --> 03:25:42.535
SAM: Of course I'm going to use them all.

4849
03:25:42.535 --> 03:25:45.155
It still won't add up to total.

4850
03:25:45.155 --> 03:25:47.519
LIAM: Arcane recovery.
TRAVIS: Hmm.

4851
03:25:47.519 --> 03:25:50.749
MARISHA: Well, I'm good, can I, like,
I guess look around the study

4852
03:25:50.749 --> 03:25:53.195
or some shit I guess, while they rest?

4853
03:25:53.195 --> 03:25:54.869
TRAVIS: I'm good, too. I'll keep Beau company.

4854
03:25:54.869 --> 03:25:58.143
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll take a little library tour.

4855
03:25:58.143 --> 03:26:00.922
See if we see anything, I'll look for shit that

4856
03:26:00.922 --> 03:26:02.361
might be hidden or might not have been found.

4857
03:26:02.361 --> 03:26:04.599
TRAVIS: Just a reminder, don't touch the stained glass.

4858
03:26:04.599 --> 03:26:06.608
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4859
03:26:08.525 --> 03:26:09.676
LIAM: (sighs)

4860
03:26:10.701 --> 03:26:11.534
MARISHA: Okay.

4861
03:26:14.729 --> 03:26:16.320
24.

4862
03:26:18.509 --> 03:26:20.685
MATT: Beyond the chamber entrances that were outlined

4863
03:26:20.685 --> 03:26:23.816
by Halas when Nott was speaking to him,

4864
03:26:23.816 --> 03:26:25.841
most of the chamber's empty.

4865
03:26:25.841 --> 03:26:28.005
This place was pretty thoroughly rolled.
MARISHA: Okay.

4866
03:26:28.005 --> 03:26:30.506
TRAVIS: Can I go up on the platform where I previously

4867
03:26:30.506 --> 03:26:32.570
touched the glass, and now with everything

4868
03:26:32.570 --> 03:26:34.588
that we've gone through and sort of studied

4869
03:26:34.588 --> 03:26:39.335
in the Cobalt Soul and learned, does this depiction

4870
03:26:39.335 --> 03:26:42.618
of different planes mean anything else,

4871
03:26:42.618 --> 03:26:45.585
show anything else, reveal anything that maybe

4872
03:26:45.585 --> 03:26:49.168
would've been just images before?

4873
03:26:50.726 --> 03:26:53.143
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

4874
03:26:54.846 --> 03:26:55.935
SAM: Nice.

4875
03:26:55.935 --> 03:26:57.075
TRAVIS: Nah, four.

4876
03:26:57.075 --> 03:26:58.794
MATT: Four.

4877
03:26:58.794 --> 03:27:00.377
Beyond what you've gleaned before--

4878
03:27:00.377 --> 03:27:03.501
if you want to make one as well.

4879
03:27:03.501 --> 03:27:04.584
TRAVIS: A low roll.

4880
03:27:06.531 --> 03:27:08.136
MARISHA: Just a straight intelligence check?

4881
03:27:08.136 --> 03:27:09.344
MATT: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: 17.

4882
03:27:09.344 --> 03:27:10.752
MATT: 17.

4883
03:27:10.752 --> 03:27:13.720
Looking at it, it's a depiction of the inner

4884
03:27:13.720 --> 03:27:16.607
and outer planes, the connectivity of them

4885
03:27:16.607 --> 03:27:19.069
seems to have shifted slightly
since the last time you looked at it.

4886
03:27:19.069 --> 03:27:20.521
MARISHA: Oh, it's moved.

4887
03:27:20.521 --> 03:27:25.293
MATT: It's the same, you know, symbols, same colors,

4888
03:27:25.293 --> 03:27:28.075
same elements, but you noticed it's just

4889
03:27:28.075 --> 03:27:30.049
some of them have shifted slightly.

4890
03:27:30.049 --> 03:27:33.429
MARISHA: I flip through my journal,
because I took a drawing of it,

4891
03:27:33.429 --> 03:27:37.265
which I actually did, and I pull it up and I compare.

4892
03:27:37.265 --> 03:27:39.186
MATT: It looks like elements of it are orbiting slowly

4893
03:27:39.186 --> 03:27:41.315
and you've caught it at another point in its orbit.

4894
03:27:41.315 --> 03:27:44.998
MARISHA: Wow, it's like a living map.

4895
03:27:46.071 --> 03:27:48.631
But wait, this is post-Calamity?

4896
03:27:48.631 --> 03:27:49.704
MATT: Mm-mm, this is pre-Calamity.

4897
03:27:49.704 --> 03:27:50.782
MARISHA: Pre-Calamity.

4898
03:27:50.782 --> 03:27:53.974
MATT: Or you do not see a Divine Gate depicted on this.

4899
03:27:56.942 --> 03:27:58.495
MARISHA: Huh.

4900
03:27:58.495 --> 03:28:00.494
TRAVIS: Yeah, so I imagine the Divine Gate

4901
03:28:00.494 --> 03:28:02.494
goes somewhere up there.

4902
03:28:04.613 --> 03:28:06.749
What?

4903
03:28:06.749 --> 03:28:09.992
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe this map is on like a timetable

4904
03:28:09.992 --> 03:28:13.136
relevant to the happy fun ball.

4905
03:28:13.136 --> 03:28:15.152
Maybe this is like a--

4906
03:28:15.152 --> 03:28:17.091
I don't know.

4907
03:28:17.091 --> 03:28:20.190
TRAVIS: Maybe it's like a calendar,
like a window to the outside.

4908
03:28:20.190 --> 03:28:23.512
MARISHA: Like frozen in a different time. I don't know.

4909
03:28:23.512 --> 03:28:27.129
TRAVIS: It's been a short time in here,
perhaps that actually shows where it is outside.

4910
03:28:28.138 --> 03:28:30.322
MARISHA: Does that make sense, does that make sense?

4911
03:28:30.322 --> 03:28:32.378
LIAM: You said the window was pre-Calamity.

4912
03:28:32.378 --> 03:28:36.462
MATT: The window depicted is pre-Calamity.
LIAM: It's what Halas imagined pre-Calamity,

4913
03:28:36.462 --> 03:28:40.009
designed his fancy window, and now time's moved on past it.

4914
03:28:40.009 --> 03:28:42.144
MARISHA: It's moving, I don't know.

4915
03:28:42.144 --> 03:28:43.286
TALIESIN: It's animated.

4916
03:28:43.286 --> 03:28:44.409
MARISHA: Maybe I'm just--

4917
03:28:44.409 --> 03:28:46.482
TALIESIN: It's not like an app.

4918
03:28:46.482 --> 03:28:48.540
MATT: It's like a lenticular.

4919
03:28:49.708 --> 03:28:50.754
TRAVIS: What did you just say?

4920
03:28:50.754 --> 03:28:51.805
Tickle and lickle?

4921
03:28:51.805 --> 03:28:53.846
MATT: Like a lenticular, you know, the little

4922
03:28:53.846 --> 03:28:55.373
slightly animated thing.

4923
03:28:55.373 --> 03:28:57.840
TALIESIN: It's not getting real time updates.
LIAM: You stare at it for two minutes

4924
03:28:57.840 --> 03:28:59.325
and suddenly you see a dolphin.

4925
03:28:59.325 --> 03:29:01.616
MATT: Yeah. Ever so slightly.

4926
03:29:01.616 --> 03:29:03.324
LIAM: Just let your eyes go cross-eyed.

4927
03:29:03.324 --> 03:29:04.432
MARISHA: Anyway.
TRAVIS: All right.

4928
03:29:04.432 --> 03:29:06.001
MARISHA: I think I'm overthinking it.

4929
03:29:06.001 --> 03:29:07.379
Let's keep going.

4930
03:29:07.379 --> 03:29:08.955
LAURA: Let's go back.
SAM: Should we try this again?

4931
03:29:08.955 --> 03:29:09.890
TRAVIS: Yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4932
03:29:09.890 --> 03:29:10.881
TALIESIN: Let's not touch anything and let's be careful.

4933
03:29:10.881 --> 03:29:13.921
LAURA: I used a 4th-level spell
to help cure Nott a bit more.

4934
03:29:13.921 --> 03:29:14.754
MATT: Okay.

4935
03:29:15.940 --> 03:29:17.788
Hey, you're alive still.

4936
03:29:17.788 --> 03:29:19.952
TRAVIS: We move straight through the room.

4937
03:29:19.952 --> 03:29:21.855
We don't even talk, we go straight through.

4938
03:29:21.855 --> 03:29:24.462
MATT: Move past the other collection

4939
03:29:24.462 --> 03:29:28.360
of large adamantine chests and boxes that remain--

4940
03:29:28.360 --> 03:29:31.018
MARISHA: Tie my mouth again.
MATT: Okay.

4941
03:29:31.018 --> 03:29:32.889
LIAM: There's some cool stuff in the boxes.

4942
03:29:32.889 --> 03:29:33.931
LAURA: Probably.
LIAM: Oh well.

4943
03:29:33.931 --> 03:29:35.768
TALIESIN: Licorice stick.

4944
03:29:35.768 --> 03:29:38.538
MATT: Finishing through that chamber, you come to

4945
03:29:38.538 --> 03:29:40.177
the third floor.

4946
03:29:40.177 --> 03:29:42.479
This floor, now further revealing the prison tower

4947
03:29:42.479 --> 03:29:46.340
to be this slightly strange angled arrangement,

4948
03:29:46.340 --> 03:29:50.492
has a new set of stairs in the same place as the old one.

4949
03:29:50.492 --> 03:29:53.899
It seems each room itself is just another extension

4950
03:29:53.899 --> 03:29:55.903
of the previous as far as the design goes.

4951
03:29:55.903 --> 03:29:57.586
Minor adjustments.

4952
03:29:57.586 --> 03:29:59.291
One of which being this is the first pair

4953
03:29:59.291 --> 03:30:02.525
of barred prison cells you've come across.

4954
03:30:02.525 --> 03:30:04.235
There's two sets of cells, one to the right,

4955
03:30:04.235 --> 03:30:07.139
one to the left, maybe 20 by 20 feet each,

4956
03:30:07.139 --> 03:30:09.426
up against the wall on the other side.

4957
03:30:09.426 --> 03:30:13.950
Both seem to have bodies in them.

4958
03:30:13.950 --> 03:30:17.309
Glancing over, you can see one is clearly skeletal,

4959
03:30:17.309 --> 03:30:19.759
been there for some time, while the other is in

4960
03:30:19.759 --> 03:30:22.318
an advanced state of decay, some of the skin

4961
03:30:22.318 --> 03:30:23.267
and flesh remaining.

4962
03:30:23.267 --> 03:30:25.604
The smell is awful.

4963
03:30:25.604 --> 03:30:29.014
What would you like to do?

4964
03:30:29.014 --> 03:30:30.349
LIAM: What does the clothing look like

4965
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:31.734
on the one that's decaying?

4966
03:30:31.734 --> 03:30:33.444
On both of them, really.

4967
03:30:33.444 --> 03:30:36.015
MATT: Both of them are wearing what you can see

4968
03:30:36.015 --> 03:30:38.807
were once nice clothes.

4969
03:30:38.807 --> 03:30:43.265
Nice bits of well-designed attire,

4970
03:30:44.324 --> 03:30:47.036
though left dusty and now, you know,

4971
03:30:47.036 --> 03:30:51.022
thick with whatever has decayed through it.

4972
03:30:51.022 --> 03:30:53.621
You do notice that they both have

4973
03:30:53.621 --> 03:30:57.234
a collar around their neck, identical to the one

4974
03:30:57.234 --> 03:30:58.632
that the golem had affixed to you

4975
03:30:58.632 --> 03:31:01.932
when you guys had encountered it at the tower engine.

4976
03:31:04.369 --> 03:31:05.871
TRAVIS: We move down.

4977
03:31:05.871 --> 03:31:06.927
MATT: Okay.

4978
03:31:06.927 --> 03:31:09.901
LIAM: ♪ Further down, further down. ♪
MATT: You move to the fourth floor.

4979
03:31:09.901 --> 03:31:13.426
Identical to the previous, though each cell in here

4980
03:31:13.426 --> 03:31:16.004
also contains a new body.

4981
03:31:16.004 --> 03:31:19.385
One is long dead and rotting while the other

4982
03:31:19.385 --> 03:31:22.028
appears to just be sleeping, or at least is not moving,

4983
03:31:22.028 --> 03:31:25.327
similar to how you found Halas' body.

4984
03:31:26.636 --> 03:31:30.971
It's dirty and covered in soot particles.

4985
03:31:30.971 --> 03:31:32.279
SAM: No collar?

4986
03:31:33.330 --> 03:31:34.977
MATT: The color--
SAM: Collar.

4987
03:31:34.977 --> 03:31:36.379
MATT: The collar, collar, yes.

4988
03:31:36.379 --> 03:31:38.633
Both bodies have collars.

4989
03:31:38.633 --> 03:31:43.633
LIAM: And their visage is turned away,
obscured, or can we tell?

4990
03:31:43.841 --> 03:31:45.838
MATT: It's low light, if you approach the cell

4991
03:31:45.838 --> 03:31:46.972
you can probably get a good look at them.

4992
03:31:46.972 --> 03:31:50.019
LIAM: I'll squint through.
LAURA: Can I knock on the bars?

4993
03:31:50.019 --> 03:31:51.137
MATT: If you'd like to.

4994
03:31:51.137 --> 03:31:52.143
LAURA: Mm, mm-hmm.

4995
03:31:52.143 --> 03:31:53.568
MATT: (knocking)

4996
03:31:53.568 --> 03:31:56.847
The bars ring a little bit, the body-- (gasping)

4997
03:31:56.847 --> 03:32:00.589
Looks over and you can see, a bit disheveled,

4998
03:32:00.589 --> 03:32:03.159
bright-eyed and slightly, kind of,

4999
03:32:03.159 --> 03:32:06.217
not coming out of a sleep, but just coming out of rest,

5000
03:32:07.808 --> 03:32:09.279
a surprised Yussa.

5001
03:32:09.279 --> 03:32:10.886
SAM: (gasps)

5002
03:32:10.886 --> 03:32:11.719
MATT: He goes--

5003
03:32:15.747 --> 03:32:17.272
Points to the collar.

5004
03:32:17.272 --> 03:32:18.718
SAM: Oh, he can't talk, anyway.

5005
03:32:18.718 --> 03:32:22.551
LAURA: I write down, "We're here to break you out."

5006
03:32:25.470 --> 03:32:27.591
LIAM: I fill an entire piece of parchment with the words

5007
03:32:27.591 --> 03:32:30.080
"Check for traps."

5008
03:32:30.080 --> 03:32:31.443
MARISHA: (laughs)

5009
03:32:31.443 --> 03:32:34.276
SAM: I will check for traps.

5010
03:32:34.276 --> 03:32:35.199
MATT: Okay.

5011
03:32:35.199 --> 03:32:36.921
SAM: On the locking door.

5012
03:32:36.921 --> 03:32:40.458
MATT: Make an investigation check.

5013
03:32:40.458 --> 03:32:41.700
SAM: 27.

5014
03:32:41.700 --> 03:32:43.092
MATT: 27.

5015
03:32:43.092 --> 03:32:46.493
The door is indeed trapped.

5016
03:32:47.614 --> 03:32:49.547
The manner of the trap seems to not be

5017
03:32:49.547 --> 03:32:51.162
anything immediately present.

5018
03:32:51.162 --> 03:32:52.984
You can see there is some sort of a very, very

5019
03:32:52.984 --> 03:32:56.282
faintly hidden line, like a pulse,

5020
03:32:56.282 --> 03:32:58.194
similar to what you've seen in some of the other glyphs

5021
03:32:58.194 --> 03:33:00.304
that you see Caleb write or what you've seen

5022
03:33:00.304 --> 03:33:03.096
in the previous Halas' ritual chamber.

5023
03:33:03.096 --> 03:33:04.485
But it goes up the bar to the ceiling

5024
03:33:04.485 --> 03:33:07.966
and then continues up to the previous floor.

5025
03:33:07.966 --> 03:33:12.773
SAM: So it can't be undone on this floor, or?

5026
03:33:12.773 --> 03:33:15.099
MATT: Meaning you just-- you can see that it is trapped,

5027
03:33:15.099 --> 03:33:16.844
and the nature, what you don't understand,

5028
03:33:16.844 --> 03:33:18.278
it is connected to something--

5029
03:33:18.278 --> 03:33:21.622
LIAM: See a ley line of energy going upstairs.
SAM: Got it, got it.

5030
03:33:21.622 --> 03:33:22.641
LIAM: Unclear what that means.

5031
03:33:22.641 --> 03:33:23.559
SAM: Okay, so I'll--
LAURA: I write down--

5032
03:33:24.850 --> 03:33:28.641
Is only the door trapped, or are the bars trapped, too?

5033
03:33:28.641 --> 03:33:30.525
SAM: I don't know, is--

5034
03:33:30.525 --> 03:33:32.470
MATT: The bars are about that far apart,

5035
03:33:32.470 --> 03:33:36.262
like about an inch and a half, they're pretty thin.

5036
03:33:36.262 --> 03:33:38.987
But the bars are not trapped from what you can tell,

5037
03:33:38.987 --> 03:33:40.468
but you only checked the door.

5038
03:33:40.468 --> 03:33:42.876
SAM: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Poke Caleb.

5039
03:33:42.876 --> 03:33:44.459
"Are the bars magic?"

5040
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:48.267
SAM: Oh! Because you can just--
MARISHA: I get what you're laying down.

5041
03:33:48.267 --> 03:33:52.086
LIAM: I can only give an estimate and inspect them,

5042
03:33:52.086 --> 03:33:55.307
I can't detect anything.
MATT: Make an arcana check.

5043
03:33:55.307 --> 03:33:57.724
LIAM: Yeah, I'll make an arcana check.

5044
03:33:59.353 --> 03:34:00.373
Ah!

5045
03:34:00.373 --> 03:34:01.481
It's a 29.

5046
03:34:03.431 --> 03:34:06.930
MATT: Looking at the bars, I mean, you don't see any sort of

5047
03:34:06.930 --> 03:34:09.482
carvings or runes or anything on them that would

5048
03:34:09.482 --> 03:34:11.566
belie an enchantment necessarily on them.

5049
03:34:11.566 --> 03:34:13.505
It seems to be most of the defenses

5050
03:34:13.505 --> 03:34:16.576
of this particular prison are the entire

5051
03:34:16.576 --> 03:34:17.991
suffused atmosphere of the prison

5052
03:34:17.991 --> 03:34:22.595
and the traps based on one you've already encountered,

5053
03:34:22.595 --> 03:34:25.126
as well as the exits to each of these cells.

5054
03:34:25.126 --> 03:34:29.645
So the bars, you do not believe are enchanted in some way.

5055
03:34:29.645 --> 03:34:32.451
LIAM: Difference between door and bars is again, I'm sorry?

5056
03:34:32.451 --> 03:34:34.567
MATT: The door opens, the bars don't.

5057
03:34:34.567 --> 03:34:36.683
LIAM: No, I know that.
LAURA: The whole wall is bars.

5058
03:34:36.683 --> 03:34:37.516
MATT: It's all bars, so

5059
03:34:37.516 --> 03:34:39.501
there's one section that can open.
LIAM: So there's a door in a section of it.

5060
03:34:39.501 --> 03:34:40.573
and that's the problem part.
MATT: Correct.

5061
03:34:40.573 --> 03:34:41.406
TALIESIN: Like a jail cell.

5062
03:34:46.198 --> 03:34:47.392
LAURA: I bust out my paints.

5063
03:34:47.392 --> 03:34:49.910
LIAM: I write down, "I think" on a
piece of paper and hold it up.

5064
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:51.241
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my paints.

5065
03:34:51.241 --> 03:34:52.074
MATT: Okay.

5066
03:34:52.074 --> 03:34:57.074
LAURA: I'm going to try to draw, paint holes

5067
03:34:57.148 --> 03:35:00.713
in multiple metal bars so I can pull out,

5068
03:35:00.713 --> 03:35:03.324
like, a window section of the bars.

5069
03:35:03.324 --> 03:35:05.774
MATT: Okay, so you're painting as if it was clear?

5070
03:35:05.774 --> 03:35:08.140
LAURA: Yeah, I'm painting it like, as if there's nothing--

5071
03:35:08.140 --> 03:35:10.371
like a little gap, right.

5072
03:35:10.371 --> 03:35:14.291
Basically, I'm painting what is behind the bars,

5073
03:35:14.291 --> 03:35:15.560
so it looks like--
TRAVIS: Are you doing the Roger Rabbit?

5074
03:35:15.560 --> 03:35:17.217
MARISHA: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah, fully.

5075
03:35:17.217 --> 03:35:18.925
Yeah, I'm trying to--

5076
03:35:18.925 --> 03:35:20.253
MATT: Okay.

5077
03:35:20.253 --> 03:35:21.988
LAURA: Paint them away.

5078
03:35:21.988 --> 03:35:23.662
MATT: Make a performance check.

5079
03:35:23.662 --> 03:35:24.876
SAM: Yeah.

5080
03:35:24.876 --> 03:35:26.487
TRAVIS: I'll move to the stairwell, keep an eye

5081
03:35:26.487 --> 03:35:28.371
on the downward stairs.

5082
03:35:28.371 --> 03:35:30.491
TALIESIN: My eyes are darting.

5083
03:35:30.491 --> 03:35:31.324
LAURA: It's touch, okay.

5084
03:35:31.324 --> 03:35:33.469
Guidance is just touch, so I'm going to.

5085
03:35:33.469 --> 03:35:34.963
MATT: I'll let you either make a performance check

5086
03:35:34.963 --> 03:35:37.524
or a dexterity check, your call.

5087
03:35:38.432 --> 03:35:41.042
LAURA: Okay, I'm definitely going to go--

5088
03:35:41.042 --> 03:35:42.592
MATT: Either you're practicing and training yourself

5089
03:35:42.592 --> 03:35:44.190
from a performance standpoint, or you are--

5090
03:35:44.190 --> 03:35:45.864
TALIESIN: Actually, you're going to hate me,

5091
03:35:45.864 --> 03:35:47.570
Guidance is not just touch.

5092
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:48.851
LAURA: Yes-- oh, it's verbal.

5093
03:35:48.851 --> 03:35:50.691
TALIESIN: Yeah, see.
LIAM: She would know that, though.

5094
03:35:50.691 --> 03:35:53.041
LAURA: Oh, the action, the range is touch.

5095
03:35:53.041 --> 03:35:54.370
I wouldn't have done it, yeah.

5096
03:35:54.370 --> 03:35:56.866
Okay, fine.
TALIESIN: Sorry.

5097
03:35:56.866 --> 03:35:58.684
(groans)
SAM: Where's that orange one?

5098
03:35:58.684 --> 03:35:59.525
LAURA: What, this one?

5099
03:35:59.525 --> 03:36:01.441
SAM: Yeah. It's been good.

5100
03:36:02.426 --> 03:36:03.532
LAURA: I'll use the Critical Role one.

5101
03:36:03.532 --> 03:36:04.396
SAM: Oh.

5102
03:36:04.396 --> 03:36:06.313
TALIESIN: Good for you.
SAM: Denied.

5103
03:36:08.475 --> 03:36:11.491
(laughter)

5104
03:36:11.491 --> 03:36:12.604
LAURA: Okay.

5105
03:36:12.604 --> 03:36:14.186
(laughter)

5106
03:36:14.186 --> 03:36:16.088
That's eight.
SAM: They both sucked.

5107
03:36:16.088 --> 03:36:18.291
LAURA: Yeah, but still, it was better than a one.

5108
03:36:18.291 --> 03:36:19.124
Eight.

5109
03:36:19.124 --> 03:36:21.258
MATT: Okay. You do an okay job.

5110
03:36:21.258 --> 03:36:23.841
The bars look weakened, but they're not going to be

5111
03:36:23.841 --> 03:36:24.827
an immediate pull out.

5112
03:36:24.827 --> 03:36:25.873
LAURA: (grunts)

5113
03:36:25.873 --> 03:36:27.873
MATT: Make a strength check.

5114
03:36:30.695 --> 03:36:31.943
LAURA: 15.

5115
03:36:31.943 --> 03:36:34.367
MATT: 15. (creaking, ringing)

5116
03:36:34.367 --> 03:36:35.983
The bars come out.

5117
03:36:35.983 --> 03:36:40.316
Yussa immediately gets up onto his feet.

5118
03:36:41.541 --> 03:36:44.777
Steps through the gap you made.

5119
03:36:44.777 --> 03:36:47.649
LAURA: I dance around in silence, holding bars in my hand.

5120
03:36:47.649 --> 03:36:48.636
TRAVIS: We need to move.

5121
03:36:48.636 --> 03:36:50.921
TALIESIN: We're going to book.
TRAVIS: <i>Quickly.</i>

5122
03:36:50.921 --> 03:36:51.754
MATT: Okay.

5123
03:36:52.687 --> 03:36:56.126
You begin to head up the stairs, Yussa following suit.

5124
03:36:56.126 --> 03:36:58.334
You head up to the next floor.

5125
03:36:59.489 --> 03:37:02.134
TALIESIN: Is the golem above, in the--

5126
03:37:02.134 --> 03:37:04.032
TRAVIS: We're only on the third floor now.

5127
03:37:04.032 --> 03:37:05.073
Golem's on the first.
TALIESIN: Not there yet, okay.

5128
03:37:05.073 --> 03:37:06.152
MATT: He's on the first.
TALIESIN: Okay.

5129
03:37:06.152 --> 03:37:07.785
TRAVIS: And he is probably working.

5130
03:37:07.785 --> 03:37:11.603
MATT: You head up to the second floor.

5131
03:37:11.603 --> 03:37:14.270
Pass the chests and the boxes.

5132
03:37:15.394 --> 03:37:16.977
Up the first floor.

5133
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:20.315
Golem's still--
TRAVIS: In the ceiling?

5134
03:37:20.315 --> 03:37:22.466
MATT: Situated in the ceiling.

5135
03:37:22.466 --> 03:37:23.981
TRAVIS: Out, get the fuck out.

5136
03:37:23.981 --> 03:37:25.632
MARISHA: Let's go.

5137
03:37:25.632 --> 03:37:27.051
MATT: All right.

5138
03:37:27.051 --> 03:37:30.581
You guys head into the Circlebound Chamber.

5139
03:37:30.581 --> 03:37:33.971
As you step in, there you see the horned devil

5140
03:37:33.971 --> 03:37:37.200
who goes, "Ah, twice returned, twice returned,

5141
03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:38.866
"twice still now."

5142
03:37:38.866 --> 03:37:40.374
TALIESIN: Shut the door and keep going.

5143
03:37:40.374 --> 03:37:42.055
MATT: "Where are you going?"
LIAM: Keep rolling.

5144
03:37:42.055 --> 03:37:44.074
MATT: "You made a promise to me!"

5145
03:37:44.074 --> 03:37:45.766
LAURA: We didn't make a promise.
TALIESIN: We said we'd come back,

5146
03:37:45.766 --> 03:37:47.170
but that was all we said.

5147
03:37:47.170 --> 03:37:48.379
LIAM: Back to the study.

5148
03:37:48.379 --> 03:37:49.854
MATT: "(shouts)"

5149
03:37:49.854 --> 03:37:52.090
And begins to just yell loudly.

5150
03:37:52.090 --> 03:37:52.946
LAURA: Oh, poor guy.

5151
03:37:52.946 --> 03:37:55.331
MATT: Anguish and frustration.

5152
03:37:55.331 --> 03:37:57.773
The wings battering against the exterior,

5153
03:37:57.773 --> 03:37:59.998
the barrier flashing behind you as the exit.

5154
03:37:59.998 --> 03:38:02.934
Yussa's like (coughing), trying to cough

5155
03:38:02.934 --> 03:38:04.565
with the collar still on, he's like--

5156
03:38:04.565 --> 03:38:05.839
LAURA: We remember how to get the thing off, right?

5157
03:38:05.839 --> 03:38:06.912
SAM: Of course, yeah.

5158
03:38:06.912 --> 03:38:09.251
I'll check it for traps.

5159
03:38:09.251 --> 03:38:11.330
TALIESIN: Once we're in the study.
LAURA: Yeah, in the study.

5160
03:38:11.330 --> 03:38:12.830
MATT: Okay, go for it.

5161
03:38:14.307 --> 03:38:15.142
SAM: 28.

5162
03:38:15.142 --> 03:38:15.975
MATT: It is not trapped.

5163
03:38:15.975 --> 03:38:18.072
SAM: I will try to unlock it.

5164
03:38:19.311 --> 03:38:21.597
20, 30.

5165
03:38:21.597 --> 03:38:23.211
LAURA: 2030.

5166
03:38:23.211 --> 03:38:25.217
MATT: The collar falls off, and Yussa immediately

5167
03:38:25.217 --> 03:38:26.823
grabs his neck.

5168
03:38:26.823 --> 03:38:31.823
"Ah, that is much better, thank you very much.

5169
03:38:32.508 --> 03:38:36.605
"So thank you, I appreciate this,

5170
03:38:36.605 --> 03:38:38.584
"but we can talk more when we get out of here."

5171
03:38:38.584 --> 03:38:39.452
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

5172
03:38:39.452 --> 03:38:40.535
TALIESIN: We can go through the--

5173
03:38:40.535 --> 03:38:42.763
probably we know how to get out through the treasure room.

5174
03:38:42.763 --> 03:38:44.473
LIAM: Yes, that would be the way to go.

5175
03:38:44.473 --> 03:38:45.306
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5176
03:38:45.306 --> 03:38:49.537
MATT: He looks back towards the prison, he's like,

5177
03:38:49.537 --> 03:38:51.586
"They took all of my components

5178
03:38:51.586 --> 03:38:55.186
"and most of the things that I had taken

5179
03:38:55.186 --> 03:38:57.641
"from this last journey through the halls."

5180
03:38:57.641 --> 03:38:59.563
TALIESIN: Well, it's going to get weirder once we're out,

5181
03:38:59.563 --> 03:39:01.970
because we found something.

5182
03:39:01.970 --> 03:39:02.803
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

5183
03:39:04.384 --> 03:39:06.468
TRAVIS: Should we tell him now?

5184
03:39:06.468 --> 03:39:08.619
MATT: "I would just hate to leave it all behind."

5185
03:39:08.619 --> 03:39:10.526
LAURA: Well, you could try to get it,

5186
03:39:10.526 --> 03:39:13.008
but it's super duper trapped, and if you don't do it,

5187
03:39:13.008 --> 03:39:14.983
you die and also the thing bamfs away,

5188
03:39:14.983 --> 03:39:17.310
so possibly it's already gone.
TALIESIN: We should probably tell him

5189
03:39:17.310 --> 03:39:18.843
before we go any further.

5190
03:39:18.843 --> 03:39:22.260
MATT: "Then let's continue on, I'm fine."

5191
03:39:23.320 --> 03:39:24.913
TRAVIS: You don't want to tell him what we're holding?

5192
03:39:24.913 --> 03:39:27.405
MARISHA: That's what I'm doing.
LIAM: I think this is the place to do it, actually.

5193
03:39:27.405 --> 03:39:29.839
TALIESIN: Actually, this might be the best place to do it.

5194
03:39:29.839 --> 03:39:31.105
LAURA: What, why?

5195
03:39:31.105 --> 03:39:32.592
MATT: Do you have the map with you still?

5196
03:39:32.592 --> 03:39:33.425
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5197
03:39:33.425 --> 03:39:35.206
MATT: Yussa immediately takes it from and looks at it--

5198
03:39:35.206 --> 03:39:37.504
TALIESIN: We've added a little bit that we found.

5199
03:39:37.504 --> 03:39:38.843
MARISHA: Yeah.

5200
03:39:38.843 --> 03:39:40.663
MATT: "Interesting."

5201
03:39:40.663 --> 03:39:41.496
TALIESIN: We also--

5202
03:39:41.496 --> 03:39:42.830
LAURA: Why is this the best place to do it?

5203
03:39:42.830 --> 03:39:45.124
Time is passing really fast.

5204
03:39:45.124 --> 03:39:47.048
TALIESIN: That's true, we should--
LIAM: Well, we--

5205
03:39:47.048 --> 03:39:49.394
MARISHA: Because we got to talk about it before we get out.

5206
03:39:49.394 --> 03:39:51.527
LAURA: Why?
TALIESIN: I would prefer to

5207
03:39:51.527 --> 03:39:54.230
enter his domain with some permission.
TRAVIS: Either he comes out here

5208
03:39:54.230 --> 03:39:55.341
or he comes out in our world.

5209
03:39:55.341 --> 03:39:57.487
LIAM: Or he does not come out at all.

5210
03:39:57.487 --> 03:39:58.412
TALIESIN: Well, that's a discussion--

5211
03:39:58.412 --> 03:40:00.231
MATT: "What are you talking about, if I might ask?"

5212
03:40:00.231 --> 03:40:02.885
SAM: We found Halas.

5213
03:40:02.885 --> 03:40:05.362
TALIESIN: He's the reason we got you out.
MATT: "You found him."

5214
03:40:05.362 --> 03:40:06.241
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

5215
03:40:06.241 --> 03:40:08.158
TALIESIN: He did help free you.

5216
03:40:10.164 --> 03:40:11.760
MARISHA: He wants us to free him.

5217
03:40:11.760 --> 03:40:14.543
SAM: He's trapped in a gem prison,

5218
03:40:14.543 --> 03:40:17.081
he's trapped in this gem prison.

5219
03:40:17.081 --> 03:40:19.688
MATT: "There is no honor amongst mages of his ilk.

5220
03:40:19.688 --> 03:40:22.938
"Whatever arrangement you made, do not fulfill it."

5221
03:40:22.938 --> 03:40:24.088
MARISHA: Why?

5222
03:40:25.422 --> 03:40:28.338
MATT: "Or do it at your own folly.
I'm not dealing with this thing."

5223
03:40:28.338 --> 03:40:31.946
LAURA: No no no, let's just, you guys.

5224
03:40:31.946 --> 03:40:33.112
SAM: What?

5225
03:40:33.112 --> 03:40:34.059
LAURA: Get out of here.

5226
03:40:34.059 --> 03:40:37.118
SAM: That's fine. Do we leave the gem here?

5227
03:40:37.118 --> 03:40:40.117
LAURA: No, we take it with us, and we give it to like,

5228
03:40:40.117 --> 03:40:42.099
Yussa or Allura, or somebody that's

5229
03:40:42.099 --> 03:40:43.786
going to keep it super safe.

5230
03:40:43.786 --> 03:40:45.538
TRAVIS: Yussa, would you be interested in protecting

5231
03:40:45.538 --> 03:40:47.183
a gem and the body of Halas?

5232
03:40:47.183 --> 03:40:50.167
SAM: No offense, but we gave Yussa the Happy Fun Ball

5233
03:40:50.167 --> 03:40:54.983
for him to protect, and he got lost in it for an eternity.

5234
03:40:55.914 --> 03:40:58.491
LAURA: Do you know how many years have passed?

5235
03:40:58.491 --> 03:41:01.041
35 years.

5236
03:41:03.573 --> 03:41:04.888
MATT: Make a deception check.

5237
03:41:04.888 --> 03:41:06.121
(laughter)

5238
03:41:06.121 --> 03:41:07.276
SAM: We all aged.

5239
03:41:07.276 --> 03:41:08.284
LAURA: Natural one.

5240
03:41:08.284 --> 03:41:10.636
(laughter)

5241
03:41:10.636 --> 03:41:12.857
TRAVIS: Still a powerful wizard,
still want him to be our friend.

5242
03:41:12.857 --> 03:41:17.792
MATT: Yussa's right eyebrow cocks up and goes,

5243
03:41:17.792 --> 03:41:22.517
"Well then, I appreciate you taking your sweet time."

5244
03:41:23.555 --> 03:41:27.055
TALIESIN: We would feel inappropriate not at least

5245
03:41:29.496 --> 03:41:32.715
ruminating on the notion of freeing Halas,

5246
03:41:32.715 --> 03:41:34.810
considering that he was pretty straight with us

5247
03:41:34.810 --> 03:41:36.191
in getting you out of here.

5248
03:41:36.191 --> 03:41:38.365
MATT: "Oh, he's been straight as he said what he thought

5249
03:41:38.365 --> 03:41:39.374
"you needed to hear."

5250
03:41:39.374 --> 03:41:42.089
LIAM: He created a laboratory full of freaks of nature.

5251
03:41:42.089 --> 03:41:44.660
He was carving pieces of a heart out

5252
03:41:44.660 --> 03:41:46.787
so he could live for an eternity.

5253
03:41:46.787 --> 03:41:47.797
We should not free him.

5254
03:41:47.797 --> 03:41:49.255
We can get out now.
MATT: "I can say as an individual

5255
03:41:49.255 --> 03:41:50.513
that has lived as long as I have

5256
03:41:50.513 --> 03:41:53.516
and been amongst mages of his ilk and stronger,

5257
03:41:53.516 --> 03:41:58.214
at a certain point, morality becomes unnecessary.

5258
03:41:58.214 --> 03:42:00.452
TRAVIS: I think we're fine not releasing him.

5259
03:42:00.452 --> 03:42:02.394
I think the only question is, we should let you know,

5260
03:42:02.394 --> 03:42:04.802
we also destroyed the Permaheart in here,

5261
03:42:04.802 --> 03:42:08.233
but we've also made contact with Allura Vysoren.

5262
03:42:08.233 --> 03:42:09.863
MATT: "(sighs) Good."

5263
03:42:09.863 --> 03:42:12.995
TRAVIS: Is this something that someone of your group

5264
03:42:12.995 --> 03:42:16.014
would like to oversee, or should we leave this here?

5265
03:42:17.081 --> 03:42:19.299
MATT: "It's tempting to leave it behind,

5266
03:42:19.299 --> 03:42:20.641
"but I would hate to think what happens

5267
03:42:20.641 --> 03:42:24.626
"if somebody else were to get him within their grasp

5268
03:42:24.626 --> 03:42:27.899
"and make the mistake of releasing him.

5269
03:42:27.899 --> 03:42:31.615
"Hold onto it for now, do not touch it.

5270
03:42:31.615 --> 03:42:33.025
"The fact that he has not taken you over

5271
03:42:33.025 --> 03:42:38.025
"means that this is not what I had assumed it would be.

5272
03:42:38.255 --> 03:42:42.078
"We know that none of you have," at this point,

5273
03:42:42.078 --> 03:42:45.455
Yussa suddenly looks extremely suspicious of all of you.

5274
03:42:45.455 --> 03:42:47.083
LAURA: What?

5275
03:42:47.083 --> 03:42:48.075
What?

5276
03:42:48.075 --> 03:42:51.200
MARISHA: None of us are Halas.
SAM: You think one of us has been turned?

5277
03:42:51.200 --> 03:42:52.671
LAURA: We thought that, too, maybe.

5278
03:42:52.671 --> 03:42:54.354
TALIESIN: But no, everybody has maintained

5279
03:42:54.354 --> 03:42:56.970
their normal amount of chaotic ridiculousness.

5280
03:42:56.970 --> 03:42:59.342
It would be pretty impressive if anyone was capable

5281
03:42:59.342 --> 03:43:03.172
of pretending to be quite as crazy as the rest of us are.

5282
03:43:03.172 --> 03:43:05.719
LIAM: Yussa, I would have thought to leave him here.

5283
03:43:05.719 --> 03:43:08.792
I find it hard to trust anything he's told us,

5284
03:43:08.792 --> 03:43:13.182
and I'm wary of carrying him back to our home,

5285
03:43:13.182 --> 03:43:16.306
if he is able to get out whenever he wants.

5286
03:43:16.306 --> 03:43:17.698
MATT: "If he could get out, he would have gone out

5287
03:43:17.698 --> 03:43:19.731
"through one of you already."

5288
03:43:19.731 --> 03:43:20.947
LAURA: Maybe he's in you, Caleb,

5289
03:43:20.947 --> 03:43:23.770
and you're wanting to leave actual Caleb behind.

5290
03:43:23.770 --> 03:43:25.815
MATT: "If I know the nature of this."

5291
03:43:25.815 --> 03:43:27.408
LIAM: I haven't touched the gem.

5292
03:43:27.408 --> 03:43:31.582
MATT: "If he does not have the means of possessing somebody,

5293
03:43:31.582 --> 03:43:35.889
"and the body is not within a certain radius,

5294
03:43:35.889 --> 03:43:38.253
"dispelling will destroy him.

5295
03:43:38.253 --> 03:43:40.278
"How about we leave the body here,

5296
03:43:40.278 --> 03:43:42.661
"and take the gem with us?"

5297
03:43:42.661 --> 03:43:44.446
MARISHA: And dispel it in the real world?

5298
03:43:44.446 --> 03:43:46.977
MATT: "Not dispel it, seal it away."

5299
03:43:46.977 --> 03:43:51.546
SAM: Can I just tell if Yussa seems on the level right now?

5300
03:43:51.546 --> 03:43:52.978
MATT: Make an insight check.
LIAM: Yeah.

5301
03:43:52.978 --> 03:43:54.562
TRAVIS: I'll back you up.

5302
03:43:54.562 --> 03:43:56.664
SAM: What does that mean?
TRAVIS and MARISHA: You get advantage.

5303
03:43:56.664 --> 03:43:58.364
LIAM: He's high balling as well.

5304
03:43:59.280 --> 03:44:00.689
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it.

5305
03:44:00.689 --> 03:44:02.441
TRAVIS: My insight sucks.

5306
03:44:02.441 --> 03:44:03.755
MATT: I'm not giving you advantage.

5307
03:44:03.755 --> 03:44:05.422
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. I can roll as well.

5308
03:44:05.422 --> 03:44:06.968
MATT: I'd say both of you guys roll separately.

5309
03:44:06.968 --> 03:44:07.801
TRAVIS: One.

5310
03:44:07.801 --> 03:44:09.251
(laughter)

5311
03:44:09.251 --> 03:44:10.253
SAM: 15.

5312
03:44:10.253 --> 03:44:12.107
MATT: 15.

5313
03:44:12.107 --> 03:44:15.843
Yussa's already a pretty hard to read person in general,

5314
03:44:15.843 --> 03:44:17.586
you haven't seen him quite as frazzled,

5315
03:44:17.586 --> 03:44:20.280
though for a person who looks as dirty and, you know,

5316
03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:23.276
fresh out of prison, he's a little more put together

5317
03:44:23.276 --> 03:44:24.816
than he was when you first found him.

5318
03:44:24.816 --> 03:44:27.572
LAURA: Does he smell as bad as Caleb used to?

5319
03:44:27.572 --> 03:44:31.523
MATT: No, elves and humans have very different ways of,

5320
03:44:31.523 --> 03:44:32.899
(laughter)

5321
03:44:32.899 --> 03:44:34.970
you know, ripening.

5322
03:44:34.970 --> 03:44:37.745
TALIESIN: Let's not forget why we
came in here in the first place is

5323
03:44:37.745 --> 03:44:39.106
we're trying to make friends.
LIAM: (like Jester) We did it, Caleb,

5324
03:44:39.106 --> 03:44:42.239
and you don't smell anymore.

5325
03:44:42.239 --> 03:44:43.722
TRAVIS: Yes, we are trying to make friends,

5326
03:44:43.722 --> 03:44:44.938
and are we trying to go out the door

5327
03:44:44.938 --> 03:44:46.912
that has the dragon's hoard?

5328
03:44:46.912 --> 03:44:48.426
TALIESIN: Let's go with the dragon's hoard and let's--

5329
03:44:48.426 --> 03:44:50.388
SAM: So we're leaving the body, taking the gem.

5330
03:44:50.388 --> 03:44:52.026
TALIESIN: We're listening to the person

5331
03:44:52.026 --> 03:44:54.404
that we're going to be listening to.

5332
03:44:54.404 --> 03:44:55.886
SAM: There's no chance that this gem

5333
03:44:55.886 --> 03:44:57.777
will just suddenly magically work.

5334
03:44:57.777 --> 03:44:59.094
TRAVIS: Going to find out. Yussa, I don't suppose

5335
03:44:59.094 --> 03:45:01.690
you've touched that red pane on the stained glass window,

5336
03:45:01.690 --> 03:45:03.300
have you?

5337
03:45:03.300 --> 03:45:04.442
MATT: "That one there?"
TRAVIS: Yes.

5338
03:45:04.442 --> 03:45:08.684
MATT: "Yes, it's how I cataloged it on the map."

5339
03:45:08.684 --> 03:45:10.623
TRAVIS: By the way, did you go through there

5340
03:45:10.623 --> 03:45:14.347
and already take all of the bounty that was in there?

5341
03:45:14.347 --> 03:45:16.325
MATT: "Yes, what do you think is within

5342
03:45:16.325 --> 03:45:20.800
"one of my bags within an adamantine box?"

5343
03:45:22.032 --> 03:45:22.976
TALIESIN: Well, one of those boxes.

5344
03:45:22.976 --> 03:45:24.644
MATT: "Not all of it, I have, this was not

5345
03:45:24.644 --> 03:45:26.894
"my first trip through here."

5346
03:45:27.946 --> 03:45:29.803
TRAVIS: All right, well, let's go and collect what we can.

5347
03:45:29.803 --> 03:45:32.709
LAURA: Oh man, you got a lot, and it all got taken?

5348
03:45:32.709 --> 03:45:33.926
That's balls.

5349
03:45:33.926 --> 03:45:35.604
MATT: "A lot of it.

5350
03:45:35.604 --> 03:45:38.461
"But I can always come back."

5351
03:45:38.461 --> 03:45:40.497
MARISHA: You're going to come back?

5352
03:45:40.497 --> 03:45:41.489
MATT: "Not alone.

5353
03:45:43.278 --> 03:45:45.607
"I've only mapped but a small portion of this."

5354
03:45:45.607 --> 03:45:46.869
TRAVIS: (sighs)

5355
03:45:46.869 --> 03:45:48.819
MARISHA: Yussa, this thing is called

5356
03:45:48.819 --> 03:45:51.300
The Mage's Bane or some--

5357
03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:53.396
TRAVIS: Archmage's Bane.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5358
03:45:53.396 --> 03:45:57.137
You got sucked into a prison,

5359
03:45:57.137 --> 03:45:59.370
dragged off by a mage golem,

5360
03:45:59.370 --> 03:46:02.962
and we came in here, Nott died.

5361
03:46:02.962 --> 03:46:05.410
SAM: Why would you touch something that could potentially

5362
03:46:05.410 --> 03:46:08.304
hurt you or kill you just out of curiosity?

5363
03:46:08.304 --> 03:46:11.713
That's just stupid, man.

5364
03:46:11.713 --> 03:46:14.647
MARISHA: You're going to come back in here?
TRAVIS: Nice, Nott, that's well said.

5365
03:46:14.647 --> 03:46:17.702
MATT: "Fair, maybe, if it suits me.

5366
03:46:17.702 --> 03:46:19.107
"Not anytime soon."

5367
03:46:19.107 --> 03:46:21.718
"I've learned a few lessons from this experience."

5368
03:46:21.718 --> 03:46:23.397
LAURA: Let's leave here!

5369
03:46:23.397 --> 03:46:25.548
Time is passing really fast.

5370
03:46:25.548 --> 03:46:28.123
TRAVIS: Everybody up to the platform.

5371
03:46:29.479 --> 03:46:32.836
LIAM: Well, a fun idea would be to leave this body

5372
03:46:32.836 --> 03:46:34.003
in the prison.

5373
03:46:35.731 --> 03:46:36.996
SAM: Like locked in the prison?

5374
03:46:36.996 --> 03:46:39.202
LAURA: It doesn't matter, he can get out.
LIAM: Hmm?

5375
03:46:39.202 --> 03:46:41.448
LAURA: The golems aren't going to imprison his body.

5376
03:46:41.448 --> 03:46:43.405
They're trained for his essence.

5377
03:46:43.405 --> 03:46:46.402
We could leave the body with the fiend, though.

5378
03:46:46.402 --> 03:46:47.602
TALIESIN: Oh.

5379
03:46:47.602 --> 03:46:48.560
No.

5380
03:46:48.560 --> 03:46:51.219
TRAVIS: That's kind of fucked up towards the fiend.

5381
03:46:51.219 --> 03:46:52.364
TALIESIN: That's kind of mean.
SAM: Why?

5382
03:46:52.364 --> 03:46:53.651
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know, it's just like:

5383
03:46:53.651 --> 03:46:56.578
Here's the person that's been torturing you for 1000 years.

5384
03:46:56.578 --> 03:46:59.390
He can't answer anything, just like...

5385
03:46:59.390 --> 03:47:00.809
(laughter)

5386
03:47:00.809 --> 03:47:03.322
MATT: That is pretty fucked up.

5387
03:47:03.322 --> 03:47:05.116
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5388
03:47:05.116 --> 03:47:10.101
Let's just leave him laying on a table here in the study

5389
03:47:10.101 --> 03:47:12.908
and I'll like, put his arm above his head

5390
03:47:12.908 --> 03:47:15.496
and make him like positioned kind of sexy like.

5391
03:47:15.496 --> 03:47:20.020
LIAM: I disagree, this is the
easiest room to tolerate in here.

5392
03:47:21.479 --> 03:47:23.442
SAM: Where do you want to put him?

5393
03:47:23.442 --> 03:47:28.442
LIAM: I command Willi to take him
back through, past the demon,

5394
03:47:29.065 --> 03:47:32.683
back to the stairway, and I dump him into the stairwell.

5395
03:47:32.683 --> 03:47:35.000
MATT: (stone movement, footsteps)

5396
03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:38.769
TALIESIN: He's also still wearing
the anti-magic manacles too, so.

5397
03:47:38.769 --> 03:47:39.757
That's exciting.

5398
03:47:39.757 --> 03:47:40.957
MARISHA: The body?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

5399
03:47:40.957 --> 03:47:42.225
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we should get those back.

5400
03:47:42.225 --> 03:47:43.891
LIAM: We want those.
TALIESIN: Do you want those?

5401
03:47:43.891 --> 03:47:45.530
LIAM: Yeah, just in case.
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

5402
03:47:45.530 --> 03:47:46.885
LIAM: I rifle those off his body.

5403
03:47:46.885 --> 03:47:48.066
MATT: Okay, you retrieve the manacles.

5404
03:47:48.066 --> 03:47:49.615
SAM: Wait, wait.

5405
03:47:49.615 --> 03:47:52.073
I'm just going to say, like if we ever need

5406
03:47:52.073 --> 03:47:55.169
to find out where this body is, could those be used

5407
03:47:55.169 --> 03:47:57.627
as some sort of a scrying device?

5408
03:47:57.627 --> 03:47:59.416
TALIESIN: Different plane of existence.
SAM: Okay.

5409
03:47:59.416 --> 03:48:01.598
LAURA: No, it works across planes.

5410
03:48:01.598 --> 03:48:03.214
TALIESIN: Does it?

5411
03:48:03.214 --> 03:48:04.660
LAURA: No, just messaging.

5412
03:48:04.660 --> 03:48:07.947
SAM: I guess can you scry on a body?

5413
03:48:07.947 --> 03:48:09.631
TALIESIN: Yes.
TRAVIS: It has to be on the same plane.

5414
03:48:09.631 --> 03:48:11.070
LAURA: But it has to be on the same plane.

5415
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:12.128
SAM: Okay.

5416
03:48:12.128 --> 03:48:13.753
All right.

5417
03:48:13.753 --> 03:48:15.828
MARISHA: All right.
LAURA: Let's go.

5418
03:48:15.828 --> 03:48:17.297
LIAM: Double back past the demon.

5419
03:48:17.297 --> 03:48:18.292
MATT: Okay.

5420
03:48:19.259 --> 03:48:23.031
After the body's dumped, Willi makes his way back to you.

5421
03:48:23.031 --> 03:48:24.778
Yussa gets a little impatient and is like

5422
03:48:24.778 --> 03:48:26.888
waiting for the golem to return and goes,

5423
03:48:26.888 --> 03:48:28.212
"Meet me on the other side,"

5424
03:48:28.212 --> 03:48:32.100
presses the red little island gem on it.

5425
03:48:32.100 --> 03:48:33.275
LAURA: He's impatient now?

5426
03:48:33.275 --> 03:48:35.297
TALIESIN: He has been here for a while.

5427
03:48:35.297 --> 03:48:36.469
I'm going to hop as well.

5428
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:38.453
TRAVIS: I'll do the same.
LIAM: Same.

5429
03:48:38.453 --> 03:48:42.167
MATT: Each time it shatters once, and reforms.

5430
03:48:42.167 --> 03:48:45.135
Shatters again, reforms, each person being pulled into

5431
03:48:45.135 --> 03:48:46.667
and vanishing into the darkness.

5432
03:48:46.667 --> 03:48:49.954
One by one you all tumble out of the open space,

5433
03:48:49.954 --> 03:48:52.023
into the area where the dragon's lair once was,

5434
03:48:52.023 --> 03:48:53.266
where you last fought.

5435
03:48:53.266 --> 03:48:55.891
You can see, the grooves in the ground that lead towards

5436
03:48:55.891 --> 03:48:57.548
the secondary sphere, the exit sphere

5437
03:48:57.548 --> 03:49:00.319
you had previously used, still aglow from the last time

5438
03:49:00.319 --> 03:49:01.553
that you were here.

5439
03:49:01.553 --> 03:49:03.434
It had not been disabled, because the creature that

5440
03:49:03.434 --> 03:49:05.753
deals with that was killed.

5441
03:49:05.753 --> 03:49:10.387
The creature, by the way, corpse, still remains.

5442
03:49:10.387 --> 03:49:12.461
TRAVIS: Oh, do you want to salvage a blue dragon corpse?

5443
03:49:12.461 --> 03:49:14.552
MATT: It's in the early stages of decay.
TRAVIS: Never mind.

5444
03:49:14.552 --> 03:49:16.869
MATT: It hasn't been an extended period of time.

5445
03:49:16.869 --> 03:49:17.940
TRAVIS: Teeth and claws?

5446
03:49:17.940 --> 03:49:20.728
MATT: Possibly, yeah, teeth and claws'll still be there.

5447
03:49:20.728 --> 03:49:22.001
TRAVIS: Are teeth worth stuff?

5448
03:49:22.001 --> 03:49:23.454
LIAM: Pretty decent consolation prize, too.

5449
03:49:23.454 --> 03:49:25.425
Is there anything lying about?

5450
03:49:25.425 --> 03:49:28.212
MATT: There's probably a
handful of coins scattered throughout.

5451
03:49:28.212 --> 03:49:30.195
Yussa didn't, like, vacuum the whole place up.

5452
03:49:30.195 --> 03:49:31.485
LIAM: Oh, he's been in here too already.

5453
03:49:31.485 --> 03:49:33.379
LAURA: Yeah, he said.

5454
03:49:33.379 --> 03:49:38.379
TALIESIN: Yeah, is that a medicine check to remove parts?

5455
03:49:38.716 --> 03:49:40.307
MATT: I'd say...

5456
03:49:42.407 --> 03:49:43.831
go ahead and take a medicine check

5457
03:49:43.831 --> 03:49:46.195
with disadvantage because it is a different biology.

5458
03:49:46.195 --> 03:49:47.189
LAURA: Can I help out?

5459
03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:48.133
MATT: Sure.

5460
03:49:48.133 --> 03:49:49.410
LAURA: I'll give you advantage.
TALIESIN: All right.

5461
03:49:49.410 --> 03:49:50.376
MATT: Or a single roll, at least.

5462
03:49:50.376 --> 03:49:53.255
LAURA: Or, what?

5463
03:49:54.127 --> 03:49:55.998
MATT: It would be disadvantage and then because--
LAURA: Oh, a single roll.

5464
03:49:55.998 --> 03:49:56.998
Sorry.
TALIESIN: 13.

5465
03:49:56.998 --> 03:49:58.427
MATT: 15, okay.
TALIESIN: 13.

5466
03:49:58.427 --> 03:49:59.839
MATT: 13.

5467
03:49:59.839 --> 03:50:02.272
It can be done.

5468
03:50:02.272 --> 03:50:05.045
You would probably need to use, or have some help

5469
03:50:05.045 --> 03:50:07.847
with Fjord's weapon as well, or any enchanted dagger

5470
03:50:07.847 --> 03:50:09.695
as well, and it'll take you probably

5471
03:50:09.695 --> 03:50:11.685
a good hour or so to harvest.

5472
03:50:11.685 --> 03:50:12.782
TALIESIN: All right.
SAM: An hour?

5473
03:50:12.782 --> 03:50:15.054
We're going to waste a day?
LAURA: Another day?

5474
03:50:15.054 --> 03:50:16.242
TALIESIN: Another day.

5475
03:50:16.242 --> 03:50:17.825
LIAM: We're almost out.

5476
03:50:19.248 --> 03:50:21.706
SAM and TRAVIS: Sure.

5477
03:50:21.706 --> 03:50:22.910
MATT: Okay.

5478
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:24.993
Yussa turns to you and goes,

5479
03:50:24.993 --> 03:50:27.557
"(sighs) If you wish to stay and harvest, you can.

5480
03:50:27.557 --> 03:50:30.823
"I'm going to return home and have a meal."

5481
03:50:30.823 --> 03:50:33.041
TALIESIN: We'll talk when we return.

5482
03:50:33.041 --> 03:50:34.499
MATT: "All right."

5483
03:50:34.499 --> 03:50:36.708
He steps over and touches the exit sphere,

5484
03:50:36.708 --> 03:50:37.830
and you watch his body--

5485
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:39.219
LIAM: See you tomorrow.
MATT: -- vanish.

5486
03:50:39.219 --> 03:50:43.317
MARISHA: Look, I'm only judgey when it comes to me

5487
03:50:43.317 --> 03:50:46.875
risking myself for them,

5488
03:50:46.875 --> 03:50:49.532
so, I'm allowed a little.

5489
03:50:49.532 --> 03:50:51.441
TALIESIN: I'm just pointing out, that's all.

5490
03:50:51.441 --> 03:50:52.907
MARISHA: Yeah, well.

5491
03:50:54.496 --> 03:50:57.145
SAM: As they're harvesting, I'm going to pull Caleb aside.

5492
03:50:57.145 --> 03:50:58.046
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5493
03:50:58.046 --> 03:51:01.471
SAM: Just say: Hey, listen, I know you're

5494
03:51:01.471 --> 03:51:04.270
pissed at me right now, but

5495
03:51:04.270 --> 03:51:09.263
if he can help me, isn't that worth pursuing?

5496
03:51:11.886 --> 03:51:13.469
LIAM: I have his books.

5497
03:51:14.744 --> 03:51:17.159
He's a very bad man.
SAM: I know.

5498
03:51:17.159 --> 03:51:18.909
LIAM: He got sealed away for tinkering with things

5499
03:51:18.909 --> 03:51:20.596
he shouldn't have been.

5500
03:51:20.596 --> 03:51:22.366
He's a bad man.

5501
03:51:22.366 --> 03:51:23.699
SAM: I know, but...

5502
03:51:26.325 --> 03:51:27.158
Okay.

5503
03:51:29.084 --> 03:51:31.974
What are my other options, though?

5504
03:51:31.974 --> 03:51:33.919
LIAM: I have his books.

5505
03:51:33.919 --> 03:51:35.625
SAM: But they're unfinished, right?

5506
03:51:35.625 --> 03:51:39.456
LIAM: Well, let's just put a pin in it, okay?

5507
03:51:39.456 --> 03:51:42.092
Give me some time to read.

5508
03:51:42.092 --> 03:51:42.925
SAM: Okay.

5509
03:51:42.925 --> 03:51:44.531
LIAM: Then we'll talk to people who know better,

5510
03:51:44.531 --> 03:51:48.864
maybe what to do with an archmage of this magnitude.

5511
03:51:50.659 --> 03:51:51.592
SAM: Okay.

5512
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:55.907
Okay.
LIAM: This place killed you.

5513
03:51:55.907 --> 03:51:57.348
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: He made it.

5514
03:51:58.440 --> 03:51:59.523
Fashioned it.

5515
03:52:04.016 --> 03:52:06.570
TRAVIS: While they're harvesting, I'll go over to Jester

5516
03:52:06.570 --> 03:52:10.855
and say: I realize the last time we were in here,

5517
03:52:10.855 --> 03:52:13.022
you were in quite a pinch.

5518
03:52:14.034 --> 03:52:17.485
You almost died, and I think it's remarkable

5519
03:52:17.485 --> 03:52:20.319
that you helped Nott not die.

5520
03:52:21.383 --> 03:52:25.266
LAURA: Yeah, well, she helped me out a lot, too,

5521
03:52:25.266 --> 03:52:28.173
when we were in here last time, so.

5522
03:52:29.687 --> 03:52:31.604
TRAVIS: I'm glad you're here.

5523
03:52:33.405 --> 03:52:34.655
LAURA: Thanks, Fjord.

5524
03:52:35.544 --> 03:52:36.961
Glad you are, too.

5525
03:52:39.444 --> 03:52:40.944
TRAVIS: Come a long way.

5526
03:52:42.117 --> 03:52:43.658
LAURA: Fuck.

5527
03:52:45.455 --> 03:52:47.411
TRAVIS: Ready to go back.

5528
03:52:47.411 --> 03:52:48.261
LAURA: Me too.

5529
03:52:48.261 --> 03:52:49.824
TRAVIS: All right.

5530
03:52:49.824 --> 03:52:51.104
LAURA: But...

5531
03:52:51.104 --> 03:52:53.220
I kind of don't want to go back

5532
03:52:53.220 --> 03:52:56.052
to all of the bad stuff. I just want to, like,

5533
03:52:56.052 --> 03:52:57.635
go back to happy stuff.

5534
03:52:57.635 --> 03:53:01.204
This was kind of a nice escape, you know?

5535
03:53:01.204 --> 03:53:02.037
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5536
03:53:02.037 --> 03:53:06.291
LAURA: I can see why someone would
get addicted to living here.

5537
03:53:06.291 --> 03:53:08.595
TRAVIS: Or at least visiting often.

5538
03:53:08.595 --> 03:53:09.428
LAURA: Yeah.

5539
03:53:11.699 --> 03:53:12.699
TRAVIS: All right.

5540
03:53:17.402 --> 03:53:20.543
LIAM: In the harvesting time, Caleb puts Halas' books out

5541
03:53:20.543 --> 03:53:22.224
and is showing them to Nott and saying:

5542
03:53:22.224 --> 03:53:26.557
This page talks about the jar,

5543
03:53:26.557 --> 03:53:27.948
and this page--

5544
03:53:27.948 --> 03:53:30.993
and starts sharing and translating roughly

5545
03:53:30.993 --> 03:53:32.984
what everything is and sharing everything

5546
03:53:32.984 --> 03:53:36.679
that's in those spells and books to try to quell her fears.

5547
03:53:36.679 --> 03:53:37.512
MATT: Okay.

5548
03:53:42.455 --> 03:53:44.987
In the time it takes for you guys to wait for this,

5549
03:53:44.987 --> 03:53:49.291
about an hour or so, you manage to harvest from the dragon,

5550
03:53:49.291 --> 03:53:50.124
whoops.

5551
03:53:54.465 --> 03:53:56.860
A number of them break and shatter and splinter

5552
03:53:56.860 --> 03:54:00.514
from not being experienced in this, but you pull out

5553
03:54:00.514 --> 03:54:02.730
nine blue dragon's teeth.

5554
03:54:02.730 --> 03:54:03.939
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: Ooh.

5555
03:54:03.939 --> 03:54:06.259
LIAM: Nine tines.

5556
03:54:06.259 --> 03:54:07.859
LAURA: I'll put that in the haversack.

5557
03:54:07.859 --> 03:54:08.692
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5558
03:54:08.692 --> 03:54:09.719
Oh, you're putting it in the haversack?

5559
03:54:09.719 --> 03:54:10.830
I'll do it, all right.

5560
03:54:10.830 --> 03:54:12.830
MATT: As well as four claws.

5561
03:54:14.206 --> 03:54:17.049
TRAVIS: Let me negotiate with these.

5562
03:54:17.049 --> 03:54:18.202
TALIESIN: Of course.

5563
03:54:18.202 --> 03:54:22.188
MATT: These are of a younger blue dragon.

5564
03:54:22.188 --> 03:54:23.662
LAURA: Nine--
TALIESIN: That'll do.

5565
03:54:23.662 --> 03:54:27.903
I'm going to start the, I'm going to Decompose

5566
03:54:27.903 --> 03:54:29.168
on the rest of it.
MATT: Okay.

5567
03:54:29.168 --> 03:54:32.497
Immediately, you can see the fungus begin to grow over it.

5568
03:54:32.497 --> 03:54:34.570
TALIESIN: Never seen anything like that.

5569
03:54:34.570 --> 03:54:36.435
TRAVIS: Shall we away?

5570
03:54:36.435 --> 03:54:38.431
TALIESIN: Let's go home.
TRAVIS: Go to the sphere.

5571
03:54:38.431 --> 03:54:39.764
MATT: All right.

5572
03:54:39.764 --> 03:54:41.863
One by one, you each place your hand on the exit sphere,

5573
03:54:41.863 --> 03:54:45.069
feeling that surge of energy, and once more,

5574
03:54:45.069 --> 03:54:49.548
you emerge as a group in the center of Yussa's study,

5575
03:54:49.548 --> 03:54:52.628
where you had entered the Heirloom Sphere,

5576
03:54:53.553 --> 03:54:57.092
a number of, what seemed to be only a couple of days ago,

5577
03:54:57.092 --> 03:55:01.003
but now sits, a much larger period of time has passed

5578
03:55:01.003 --> 03:55:02.819
here in Exandria.

5579
03:55:02.819 --> 03:55:06.760
There as soon as you arrive, you can see Wensforth like

5580
03:55:06.760 --> 03:55:11.681
"(grunting) Excuse me. Master?"

5581
03:55:11.681 --> 03:55:13.656
And begins shouting down the stairs.

5582
03:55:13.656 --> 03:55:16.478
You hear footsteps a moment later, and Yussa approaches,

5583
03:55:16.478 --> 03:55:20.020
now clean, dressed in these

5584
03:55:20.020 --> 03:55:25.020
long, beautiful gold and silver robes,

5585
03:55:25.128 --> 03:55:27.969
tan elven skin framing the

5586
03:55:27.969 --> 03:55:31.778
somewhat warm and delighted smile

5587
03:55:31.778 --> 03:55:36.220
that he's trying to hide at seeing you all return.

5588
03:55:36.220 --> 03:55:38.953
"Well, it is very nice to see you all once more.

5589
03:55:38.953 --> 03:55:41.696
"Thank you for everything.

5590
03:55:41.696 --> 03:55:44.133
"I've had some time to reflect that you may not have had,

5591
03:55:44.133 --> 03:55:49.091
"but I'm very thankful."

5592
03:55:49.091 --> 03:55:50.661
MARISHA: Did you call Allura yet?

5593
03:55:50.661 --> 03:55:51.975
MATT: "Would you like me to?"

5594
03:55:51.975 --> 03:55:53.168
MARISHA: Yeah.

5595
03:55:53.168 --> 03:55:54.237
MATT: "Then I shall."

5596
03:55:54.237 --> 03:55:55.510
My mustache is all coming off.

5597
03:55:55.510 --> 03:55:56.791
(laughter)

5598
03:55:56.791 --> 03:56:00.152
LAURA: I love how he does it like Yussa.

5599
03:56:00.152 --> 03:56:02.652
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, I'm still putting on my face.

5600
03:56:02.652 --> 03:56:03.621
MATT: It's fine now.

5601
03:56:03.621 --> 03:56:05.186
We're almost there.
LIAM: He's stroking his mustache

5602
03:56:05.186 --> 03:56:07.936
for the whole scene.
MATT: The whole time, the whole time.

5603
03:56:10.957 --> 03:56:15.150
Why do I always pick characters with facial hair?

5604
03:56:15.150 --> 03:56:16.581
So.

5605
03:56:16.581 --> 03:56:19.302
"I could reach to her right now, if you like,

5606
03:56:19.302 --> 03:56:21.396
"and she could come.

5607
03:56:21.396 --> 03:56:25.871
"She did say that she had

5608
03:56:25.871 --> 03:56:29.154
"some curious news

5609
03:56:29.154 --> 03:56:33.110
"and wanted to speak with you on something you had

5610
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:36.864
"left with her before about this Angel of Irons business.

5611
03:56:36.864 --> 03:56:38.466
"We only spoke briefly, she said she still

5612
03:56:38.466 --> 03:56:40.577
"needed something of yours."

5613
03:56:40.577 --> 03:56:43.596
LAURA: Yes, she does, she needs something of Yasha's.

5614
03:56:43.596 --> 03:56:46.423
MATT: He closes his eyes, and you see his fingers trace

5615
03:56:46.423 --> 03:56:51.296
a familiar element of the Sending spell.

5616
03:56:51.296 --> 03:56:52.646
He says,

5617
03:56:52.646 --> 03:56:55.004
"The Mighty Nein have returned,

5618
03:56:55.004 --> 03:56:58.845
"and in one piece."

5619
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:03.150
Just a moment.

5620
03:57:03.150 --> 03:57:05.312
LAURA: That's really short.

5621
03:57:05.312 --> 03:57:09.149
You know you have a lot more words you can use.

5622
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.985
MATT: "Yes."

5623
03:57:09.985 --> 03:57:12.454
(laughter)

5624
03:57:12.454 --> 03:57:14.483
LAURA: That's kind of a waste of magic if you're not going

5625
03:57:14.483 --> 03:57:16.389
to use up everything that you could do.

5626
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:17.720
SAM: You should really say all of it.

5627
03:57:17.720 --> 03:57:20.821
MATT: "Being concise is a very useful skill."

5628
03:57:20.821 --> 03:57:24.553
LAURA: (scoffing)

5629
03:57:24.553 --> 03:57:27.094
TRAVIS: Jester, did you know that
you could send short messages?

5630
03:57:27.094 --> 03:57:29.981
LAURA: I know I can, but it seems wasteful.

5631
03:57:29.981 --> 03:57:31.947
SAM: It does. He doesn't even know if she was pooping.

5632
03:57:31.947 --> 03:57:32.780
LIAM: Yeah.

5633
03:57:32.780 --> 03:57:35.706
LAURA: You could ask so many other things.

5634
03:57:35.706 --> 03:57:38.674
So many other things!

5635
03:57:38.674 --> 03:57:41.245
MATT: "I'll keep that in mind."

5636
03:57:41.245 --> 03:57:44.430
At which point, you hear new footsteps arrive

5637
03:57:44.430 --> 03:57:48.437
as Allura has apparently teleported to the tower.

5638
03:57:48.437 --> 03:57:53.190
You can see her in very, very nice dress.

5639
03:57:53.190 --> 03:57:56.959
It's beautiful with jewelry around,

5640
03:57:56.959 --> 03:58:00.111
her graying hair pulled back into the same braid,

5641
03:58:00.111 --> 03:58:02.337
but you can see jewels put through, and she goes,

5642
03:58:02.337 --> 03:58:06.548
"Terribly sorry, we're attending sort of a formal event,

5643
03:58:06.548 --> 03:58:11.022
"but this has been gnawing at the back of my mind

5644
03:58:11.022 --> 03:58:12.272
"since you left.

5645
03:58:13.603 --> 03:58:16.226
"Come, come, Yussa, help me clear the floor a bit,"

5646
03:58:16.226 --> 03:58:18.055
and they both begin moving

5647
03:58:18.055 --> 03:58:18.903
tables and stuff out of the way.

5648
03:58:18.903 --> 03:58:22.772
Wensforth goes, "I'll just, I'll go lay down,

5649
03:58:22.772 --> 03:58:26.470
"have a nap," and leaves the chamber.

5650
03:58:26.470 --> 03:58:29.709
Allura says, as they're moving stuff out of the way, goes,

5651
03:58:29.709 --> 03:58:34.659
"So, glad you survived, really, remarkable work.

5652
03:58:35.524 --> 03:58:37.415
"If I could have that hand mirror back,
if that's all right?"

5653
03:58:37.415 --> 03:58:39.584
LAURA: Oh.

5654
03:58:39.584 --> 03:58:43.167
Are you sure you don't want to let me keep it?

5655
03:58:43.167 --> 03:58:44.922
TALIESIN: I snatch it.

5656
03:58:44.922 --> 03:58:46.464
MATT: "Thank you very much."

5657
03:58:46.464 --> 03:58:47.907
(laughs)

5658
03:58:47.907 --> 03:58:48.924
TALIESIN: We'll get you a new one.

5659
03:58:48.924 --> 03:58:50.842
LAURA: (groans)

5660
03:58:50.842 --> 03:58:52.792
(laughter)

5661
03:58:52.792 --> 03:58:55.973
MATT: "Very much more than meets the eye with these folks.

5662
03:58:55.973 --> 03:58:59.460
"You've made some good friends, Yussa.

5663
03:58:59.460 --> 03:59:03.460
"Encountered a few of similar traits in the past.

5664
03:59:05.400 --> 03:59:09.866
"So I know you mentioned this

5665
03:59:09.866 --> 03:59:12.604
"Angel of Irons scenario, right?

5666
03:59:12.604 --> 03:59:14.188
"I put a bit of research into it."

5667
03:59:14.188 --> 03:59:17.200
She moves around the tables over there with Yussa.

5668
03:59:17.200 --> 03:59:20.230
"It appears that word has gotten around in some circles,

5669
03:59:20.230 --> 03:59:23.483
"they're dealing with the chosen of Betrayers.

5670
03:59:23.483 --> 03:59:27.120
"That is a worry for us all, to be honest.

5671
03:59:27.120 --> 03:59:31.298
"I'd like to perform a ritual that peers past the veils.

5672
03:59:31.298 --> 03:59:33.877
"It will require all of us to partake in it,

5673
03:59:33.877 --> 03:59:35.431
"if you're comfortable.

5674
03:59:35.431 --> 03:59:37.413
"Gives us a better chance of success.

5675
03:59:37.413 --> 03:59:39.277
"Perhaps we can shed some light on this plight of yours,

5676
03:59:39.277 --> 03:59:43.344
"and hopefully not, but perhaps the plight of many.

5677
03:59:43.344 --> 03:59:44.595
"Gather some things for me."

5678
03:59:44.595 --> 03:59:47.133
And Yussa goes, "I know exactly what you need.

5679
03:59:47.133 --> 03:59:49.877
"Get that teal orb there," and they start pointing out

5680
03:59:49.877 --> 03:59:50.981
different things they need you to gather.

5681
03:59:50.981 --> 03:59:52.488
There's a teal crystal orb on the southern wall's

5682
03:59:52.488 --> 03:59:55.721
fourth shelf, there's silver cording wound around

5683
03:59:55.721 --> 03:59:58.404
a hook along the western wall,

5684
03:59:58.404 --> 04:00:00.498
there is incense being kept in a brass pot

5685
04:00:00.498 --> 04:00:03.584
on the floor by the desk, and they require

5686
04:00:03.584 --> 04:00:05.261
a personal effect of the person

5687
04:00:05.261 --> 04:00:06.576
that they're attempting to peer through.

5688
04:00:06.576 --> 04:00:08.659
LAURA: I'll go get the orb.

5689
04:00:08.659 --> 04:00:11.115
TRAVIS: I'll get the hook with the wiring wrapped around it.

5690
04:00:11.115 --> 04:00:12.096
TALIESIN: I'll get the incense.

5691
04:00:12.096 --> 04:00:13.414
SAM: Who are we trying to peer at?

5692
04:00:13.414 --> 04:00:14.468
LAURA: Yasha.

5693
04:00:14.468 --> 04:00:15.301
SAM: Oh.

5694
04:00:15.301 --> 04:00:19.610
LAURA: Okay, we got to find, who has something of Yasha's?

5695
04:00:20.452 --> 04:00:22.302
SAM: Oh shit.

5696
04:00:24.215 --> 04:00:26.849
TRAVIS: Anyone have one of her flowers?

5697
04:00:26.849 --> 04:00:28.628
MARISHA: Didn't she give?

5698
04:00:28.628 --> 04:00:33.437
SAM: I gave her-- no, she gave me a-- shit.

5699
04:00:36.573 --> 04:00:37.573
I'm looking.

5700
04:00:39.492 --> 04:00:40.481
Flower crown.

5701
04:00:40.481 --> 04:00:42.188
LAURA: Nope, that was from--

5702
04:00:42.188 --> 04:00:44.198
TRAVIS: This veil you're attempting to peer through.

5703
04:00:44.198 --> 04:00:47.165
Will they be able to peer back?

5704
04:00:47.165 --> 04:00:48.854
MATT: "I certainly hope not.

5705
04:00:48.854 --> 04:00:51.322
"This is more of an information gathering

5706
04:00:51.322 --> 04:00:53.380
"than an actual attempt at scrying

5707
04:00:53.380 --> 04:00:57.496
"or peering at the other side."

5708
04:00:57.496 --> 04:00:59.196
TRAVIS: All right.

5709
04:00:59.196 --> 04:01:02.529
MATT: "It's an involved,

5710
04:01:02.529 --> 04:01:04.797
"more of a custom element

5711
04:01:04.797 --> 04:01:07.547
"of a Legend Lore-type spell.

5712
04:01:09.261 --> 04:01:11.650
"I cannot guarantee it'll work, but--"

5713
04:01:11.650 --> 04:01:13.092
TALIESIN: Flowers?

5714
04:01:13.092 --> 04:01:14.519
LAURA: Does it have to be one of her effects

5715
04:01:14.519 --> 04:01:16.844
or something that she liked?

5716
04:01:18.321 --> 04:01:20.571
MATT: "We can certainly try something.

5717
04:01:20.571 --> 04:01:21.880
"Whatever you have."

5718
04:01:21.880 --> 04:01:24.075
MARISHA: I have a fabric swatch that I found.

5719
04:01:24.075 --> 04:01:25.173
LAURA: No, that was--

5720
04:01:25.173 --> 04:01:26.821
SAM: Do we have any of her weapons?

5721
04:01:26.821 --> 04:01:30.514
Did anyone give her a weapon that she gave back?

5722
04:01:30.514 --> 04:01:33.970
TRAVIS: Did we pick up those bracers she had made?

5723
04:01:33.970 --> 04:01:35.033
MATT: No.

5724
04:01:35.033 --> 04:01:39.463
LAURA: I have this drawing that I had done of Yasha

5725
04:01:39.463 --> 04:01:42.357
a long time ago that she liked.

5726
04:01:42.357 --> 04:01:46.175
She was holding it, she looked at it, I don't know if that--

5727
04:01:46.175 --> 04:01:48.508
MATT: "We'll give it a shot."

5728
04:01:51.137 --> 04:01:52.417
TRAVIS: We don't really have a habit

5729
04:01:52.417 --> 04:01:53.834
of carrying each other's shit around.

5730
04:01:53.834 --> 04:01:56.082
SAM: Yeah, but sometimes when we get new stuff--

5731
04:01:56.082 --> 04:01:58.124
TALIESIN: I was also thinking, we didn't think

5732
04:01:58.124 --> 04:02:01.004
to grab anything from the house before we left, did we?

5733
04:02:01.004 --> 04:02:02.566
SAM: Did she get a new sword?

5734
04:02:02.566 --> 04:02:04.034
Did she get a new?

5735
04:02:04.034 --> 04:02:05.558
TRAVIS: She carries both.

5736
04:02:05.558 --> 04:02:08.028
SAM: She carries her old sword with her?

5737
04:02:08.028 --> 04:02:10.788
TRAVIS: Yeah, Magician's Judge and the
big-ass bone cleaver thing.

5738
04:02:10.788 --> 04:02:12.396
LAURA: Yeah.

5739
04:02:13.571 --> 04:02:16.979
MARISHA: I mean, she did just kind of leave--

5740
04:02:16.979 --> 04:02:18.305
LAURA: She wasn't in the habit of carrying

5741
04:02:18.305 --> 04:02:21.039
a lot of random things.

5742
04:02:21.039 --> 04:02:22.658
TALIESIN: She had the stuff back home.

5743
04:02:22.658 --> 04:02:26.476
LIAM: She may have something in the Xhorhouse, yeah.

5744
04:02:26.476 --> 04:02:28.917
TRAVIS: Let's try the drawing, it's all we have.

5745
04:02:28.917 --> 04:02:31.566
TALIESIN: Makes me want to-- yeah, hopping to the house

5746
04:02:31.566 --> 04:02:33.394
and hopping back would be complicated.

5747
04:02:33.394 --> 04:02:34.394
LAURA: Yeah.

5748
04:02:35.672 --> 04:02:37.013
There's nothing in the room,

5749
04:02:37.013 --> 04:02:38.995
she didn't leave anything in it.

5750
04:02:38.995 --> 04:02:41.916
I've gone in the room a lot.

5751
04:02:41.916 --> 04:02:43.426
SAM: I'm going to look one more time.

5752
04:02:43.426 --> 04:02:44.336
MATT: "I really hope it's enough.

5753
04:02:44.336 --> 04:02:46.119
"If at least you keep an image of her in your mind

5754
04:02:46.119 --> 04:02:51.119
"as part of this ritual, that might aid its chance."

5755
04:02:51.641 --> 04:02:54.425
You see now, they're drawing this large circle,

5756
04:02:54.425 --> 04:02:55.918
it looks like a circle, but then it sometimes

5757
04:02:55.918 --> 04:02:57.702
looks like an oval, and different elements connect,

5758
04:02:57.702 --> 04:02:59.651
and there are points where she begins to point out

5759
04:02:59.651 --> 04:03:02.394
where each of you sit, but it's not a continuous circle,

5760
04:03:02.394 --> 04:03:05.301
it's kind of odd in its shape.

5761
04:03:05.301 --> 04:03:09.696
"You sit here, and you here, hold hands at this juncture,"

5762
04:03:09.696 --> 04:03:11.079
and you can see, you're all holding hands,

5763
04:03:11.079 --> 04:03:13.660
but sometimes it's like across, and the connection,

5764
04:03:13.660 --> 04:03:16.677
it's a strange mingle.

5765
04:03:18.235 --> 04:03:23.218
She asks Yussa to go ahead and light the incense.

5766
04:03:24.405 --> 04:03:26.545
He goes ahead and takes the crystal

5767
04:03:26.545 --> 04:03:28.527
and places it in the center of the ritual.

5768
04:03:28.527 --> 04:03:31.905
(as Allura) "Now think to your friend, think to this entity,

5769
04:03:31.905 --> 04:03:35.053
"this Angel of Irons.

5770
04:03:35.053 --> 04:03:37.536
"Will it to reveal itself through your connection

5771
04:03:37.536 --> 04:03:41.553
"to your friend, and let it show us itself

5772
04:03:41.553 --> 04:03:43.178
"without obfuscation.

5773
04:03:44.237 --> 04:03:45.070
"All right."

5774
04:03:47.183 --> 04:03:50.306
She waves her hand the chamber window shuts closed,

5775
04:03:50.306 --> 04:03:52.695
cutting off the sunlight.

5776
04:03:52.695 --> 04:03:55.877
Yussa snaps his fingers and a lot of the candles

5777
04:03:55.877 --> 04:03:59.456
open up around the chamber.

5778
04:03:59.456 --> 04:04:02.731
LAURA: I mean I can too, but it's fun
to see someone else do it.

5779
04:04:02.731 --> 04:04:04.051
SAM: I think you di that the first time we met.

5780
04:04:04.051 --> 04:04:05.346
LAURA: I know.

5781
04:04:05.346 --> 04:04:08.486
It goes to show, like, I'm super powerful.

5782
04:04:08.486 --> 04:04:11.883
MATT: As you all take hands and begin to focus,

5783
04:04:11.883 --> 04:04:16.533
concentrating, Allura begins to recite this incantation.

5784
04:04:16.533 --> 04:04:21.533
Incantation moves from an old Draconic,

5785
04:04:21.674 --> 04:04:24.404
to elements of Common, to old Draconic,

5786
04:04:24.404 --> 04:04:26.237
to elements of Common.

5787
04:04:27.089 --> 04:04:31.836
Speaking of "looking beyond the veil of what exists

5788
04:04:31.836 --> 04:04:34.108
"and instead call the memory and knowledge

5789
04:04:34.108 --> 04:04:38.622
"of the worlds beyond, current, past,

5790
04:04:38.622 --> 04:04:39.996
"let it all come and reveal

5791
04:04:39.996 --> 04:04:41.796
"what may stand before the future.

5792
04:04:42.670 --> 04:04:45.024
"Let all shadows be cast aside.

5793
04:04:45.024 --> 04:04:48.421
"Let all wisdom pierce the veil and reveal the true nature

5794
04:04:48.421 --> 04:04:50.676
"of what it is we seek."

5795
04:04:50.676 --> 04:04:53.323
As you all begin to focus and concentrate,

5796
04:04:53.323 --> 04:04:57.990
you can see smoke begins to swirl around you and gather.

5797
04:04:59.061 --> 04:05:00.747
It's like low dark fog that

5798
04:05:00.747 --> 04:05:02.312
settles around your knees and then begins

5799
04:05:02.312 --> 04:05:04.507
to take over your torso, where you can almost

5800
04:05:04.507 --> 04:05:08.906
barely see your hands beneath the surface of it brimming.

5801
04:05:10.447 --> 04:05:13.979
What little bit of light from the peeking element

5802
04:05:13.979 --> 04:05:18.028
of the windows, and the crackling candlelight

5803
04:05:18.028 --> 04:05:20.953
begins to darken and subside.

5804
04:05:21.812 --> 04:05:24.688
In this darkness, you can see tendrils

5805
04:05:24.688 --> 04:05:29.608
of similar type dark smoke swirling between your linked arms

5806
04:05:30.499 --> 04:05:34.840
as shapes begin to gather from them into chains.

5807
04:05:34.840 --> 04:05:39.840
Chains that pull and bind between you in odd ways.

5808
04:05:40.396 --> 04:05:44.306
Many chains, loose then taut.

5809
04:05:44.306 --> 04:05:46.806
Loose, then pulled taut again.

5810
04:05:48.654 --> 04:05:51.199
The chains all begin to gather again in the center circle

5811
04:05:51.199 --> 04:05:54.741
as Allura begins to chant louder and louder.

5812
04:05:54.741 --> 04:05:56.598
Wind begins to pick up sourcelessly,

5813
04:05:56.598 --> 04:06:01.598
blowing each of your hair into a bit of a mess of tangle.

5814
04:06:02.194 --> 04:06:04.805
All of the chains gather in a circle, binding to something.

5815
04:06:04.805 --> 04:06:09.805
You see a shape, female in form, in the center of you all

5816
04:06:10.104 --> 04:06:11.937
rising from the smoke.

5817
04:06:13.313 --> 04:06:16.146
You see it take the form of Yasha,

5818
04:06:16.981 --> 04:06:21.645
held in these chains that wrap between you,

5819
04:06:21.645 --> 04:06:24.642
as they continue to rise above her.

5820
04:06:24.642 --> 04:06:28.266
A cloud of sparks brews above her head,

5821
04:06:28.266 --> 04:06:33.266
while the chains gather, formless and writhing.

5822
04:06:33.738 --> 04:06:35.484
Allura stops her chanting and looks up to it,

5823
04:06:35.484 --> 04:06:38.076
her eyes squinting against the intensity

5824
04:06:38.076 --> 04:06:40.318
of this wind wrapping around her.

5825
04:06:40.318 --> 04:06:43.010
"Something divine watches over her,

5826
04:06:43.010 --> 04:06:46.735
"but it is held at bay by this angel..."

5827
04:06:47.612 --> 04:06:49.523
(laughter)

5828
04:06:49.523 --> 04:06:50.473
That was bound to happen.

5829
04:06:50.473 --> 04:06:52.521
LAURA: It's stuck on your beard.

5830
04:06:52.521 --> 04:06:53.717
TRAVIS: There it is.
TALIESIN: There you go.

5831
04:06:53.717 --> 04:06:54.967
MATT: I got it.

5832
04:06:57.714 --> 04:06:59.356
ALL: Yeah!

5833
04:06:59.356 --> 04:07:01.106
LIAM: Still looking good.

5834
04:07:03.463 --> 04:07:04.541
MATT: (sighs)

5835
04:07:04.541 --> 04:07:06.541
"What could possibly...

5836
04:07:07.657 --> 04:07:09.670
"Concentrate harder.

5837
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:11.314
"Show us.

5838
04:07:11.314 --> 04:07:13.814
"Reveal the form of her captor."

5839
04:07:14.769 --> 04:07:18.350
You all begin to tighten your grip

5840
04:07:18.350 --> 04:07:21.034
and focus even stronger on her.

5841
04:07:21.034 --> 04:07:24.242
The writhing cluster of chains begin to separate,

5842
04:07:24.242 --> 04:07:27.058
and in that space where she was, her form vanishes,

5843
04:07:27.058 --> 04:07:31.308
and left behind it is a black, lightless void.

5844
04:07:32.801 --> 04:07:37.801
The chains that were tangled once begin to fall into place.

5845
04:07:38.002 --> 04:07:41.227
Seven points, seven segments

5846
04:07:41.227 --> 04:07:44.114
around the pit of darkness,

5847
04:07:44.114 --> 04:07:47.364
endless, yet living.

5848
04:07:48.674 --> 04:07:50.821
It's strange to look in the blackness of night

5849
04:07:50.821 --> 04:07:52.512
and feel the emptiness, but this,

5850
04:07:52.512 --> 04:07:55.533
you look into this emptiness you feel something immense.

5851
04:07:55.533 --> 04:07:57.730
Something old.

5852
04:07:57.730 --> 04:07:58.897
Something mad.

5853
04:08:01.674 --> 04:08:06.541
A deep, guttural shout quakes the room.

5854
04:08:08.167 --> 04:08:10.051
(roars)

5855
04:08:10.051 --> 04:08:13.049
The ritual shattered, the windows break on the tower,

5856
04:08:13.049 --> 04:08:15.897
light filters in, the candles are out,

5857
04:08:15.897 --> 04:08:18.410
and all of you feel your arms thrust apart,

5858
04:08:18.410 --> 04:08:21.385
breaking the connection.

5859
04:08:21.385 --> 04:08:26.344
"(panting)

5860
04:08:27.307 --> 04:08:30.417
"This thing you chase is a ruse."

5861
04:08:30.417 --> 04:08:35.334
She looks to Yussa, Yussa goes, "There is no Angel of Irons.

5862
04:08:38.045 --> 04:08:40.272
"It is a guise for the Chained Oblivion."

5863
04:08:40.272 --> 04:08:41.857
TRAVIS: Oh...

5864
04:08:41.857 --> 04:08:43.190
MATT: "For Tharizdun.

5865
04:08:45.303 --> 04:08:50.253
"The terrible mad god of endless hunger and destruction.

5866
04:08:51.901 --> 04:08:55.692
"It masquerades its efforts for
freedom by this angel's name."

5867
04:08:57.632 --> 04:09:01.882
He looks to Allura, and Allura looks to all of you.

5868
04:09:03.436 --> 04:09:05.853
"This is a terrible portent.

5869
04:09:07.755 --> 04:09:09.922
"I must inform the council."

5870
04:09:12.082 --> 04:09:13.251
And that's where we're going to go ahead

5871
04:09:13.251 --> 04:09:15.146
and leave off the episode.

5872
04:09:15.146 --> 04:09:17.292
Pick up there next week.

5873
04:09:17.292 --> 04:09:20.052
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

5874
04:09:20.052 --> 04:09:22.534
LAURA: God.
TALIESIN: Cool, cool, cool.

5875
04:09:22.534 --> 04:09:24.905
TRAVIS: Tharizdun, yep?

5876
04:09:24.905 --> 04:09:25.886
MARISHA: Yeah, that makes sense.

5877
04:09:25.886 --> 04:09:27.400
TRAVIS: I've seen the imagery in the book

5878
04:09:27.400 --> 04:09:28.500
about the Chained Oblivion.

5879
04:09:28.500 --> 04:09:30.433
SAM: I haven't.
TRAVIS: It really sucks.

5880
04:09:30.433 --> 04:09:32.103
LIAM: Chained Oblivion in the house.

5881
04:09:32.103 --> 04:09:34.690
MARISHA: This guy has been whispered since the start

5882
04:09:34.690 --> 04:09:35.914
of this campaign.

5883
04:09:35.914 --> 04:09:37.307
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

5884
04:09:37.307 --> 04:09:39.132
TRAVIS: Just looking into the darkness of the void

5885
04:09:39.132 --> 04:09:41.156
shattered the ritual.

5886
04:09:42.048 --> 04:09:44.261
MATT: It may be, or it could've been timing.

5887
04:09:44.261 --> 04:09:45.695
You don't know.

5888
04:09:45.695 --> 04:09:48.035
TALIESIN: Or someone burped.

5889
04:09:48.035 --> 04:09:49.252
LAURA: That was you.

5890
04:09:49.252 --> 04:09:50.335
SAM: Boy oh boy.

5891
04:09:51.251 --> 04:09:53.174
MATT: Regardless, we'll pick up there next week.

5892
04:09:53.174 --> 04:09:55.166
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Oh my goodness!

5893
04:09:56.123 --> 04:09:59.188
SAM: And we're carrying around Halas in a gem?

5894
04:09:59.188 --> 04:10:00.772
LAURA: Yeah, we'll give it to Allura.

5895
04:10:00.772 --> 04:10:02.963
TALIESIN: He's not leaving this tower.

5896
04:10:02.963 --> 04:10:04.623
MATT: Great job, Matt.

5897
04:10:04.623 --> 04:10:05.980
Holy shit!
MATT: Guys.

5898
04:10:05.980 --> 04:10:07.042
TRAVIS: Happy fun ball.

5899
04:10:07.042 --> 04:10:07.925
MATT: Happy fun ball.

5900
04:10:07.925 --> 04:10:10.137
Four sessions in the happy fun ball, Jesus.

5901
04:10:10.137 --> 04:10:11.070
TALIESIN: Ready for more!

5902
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:13.428
TRAVIS: Could've done more.

5903
04:10:13.428 --> 04:10:15.874
Kind of want to do the carving farm,
kind of want to see the cave.

5904
04:10:15.874 --> 04:10:16.945
MATT: Landing there, you never saw the--

5905
04:10:16.945 --> 04:10:18.060
SAM: I want to see the bedroom.

5906
04:10:18.060 --> 04:10:19.280
TRAVIS: Crystal caves.

5907
04:10:19.280 --> 04:10:20.645
LIAM: Yeah, want to see that sex bot.

5908
04:10:20.645 --> 04:10:22.814
TALIESIN: We found another room.

5909
04:10:22.814 --> 04:10:24.692
We went off the map.

5910
04:10:24.692 --> 04:10:25.577
MATT: You did.

5911
04:10:25.577 --> 04:10:26.567
TALIESIN: We added to the map.

5912
04:10:26.567 --> 04:10:29.063
MATT: There are a number of off the map rooms in there

5913
04:10:29.063 --> 04:10:31.019
that weren't found.

5914
04:10:31.019 --> 04:10:32.831
Little sad, but also I think four sessions

5915
04:10:32.831 --> 04:10:34.253
is enough in there.

5916
04:10:34.253 --> 04:10:35.126
TALIESIN: We'll be back.

5917
04:10:35.126 --> 04:10:37.102
Level 15 we'll come back or something.

5918
04:10:37.102 --> 04:10:38.221
MATT: All right, we'll pick up next week.

5919
04:10:38.221 --> 04:10:39.927
LIAM: Yeah, high doom.

5920
04:10:39.927 --> 04:10:41.520
MATT: Happy Halloween, everybody.

5921
04:10:41.520 --> 04:10:43.105
(cheering)

5922
04:10:43.105 --> 04:10:44.876
Thank you for joining us.

5923
04:10:44.876 --> 04:10:48.878
Don't forget we love you very much and is it Thursday yet?

5924
04:10:48.878 --> 04:10:49.730
Good night.

5925
04:10:49.730 --> 04:10:51.114
(howling)

5926
04:10:51.114 --> 04:10:53.864
(dramatic orchestral music)

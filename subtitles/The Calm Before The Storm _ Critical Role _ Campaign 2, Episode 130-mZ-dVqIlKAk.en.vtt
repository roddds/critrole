00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:01.367
MATT: Hello, everyone,

00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.064
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:04.426
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.426 --> 00:00:06.114
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:08.864
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:09.884
MATT: Indeed.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:10.984
Before we get into our game tonight,

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:12.304
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:15.921
beginning with the first of two sponsors, NordVPN.

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.095
Sam?

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:20.574
SAM: This episode is sponsored by your friends at NordVPN,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:22.414
providers of highest quality encryption

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:23.424
for your internet traffic,

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.814
and hides your IP and physical location.

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:27.294
They have a great promo going on right now,

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:30.764
so go to nordvpn.com/criticalrole

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.071
or use code criticalrole and get a two-year plan

00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:38.534
plus one additional month with a huge 70% discount.

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:40.224
Protect yourself from cyber attacks

00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:43.324
and avoid bandwidth issues with NordVPN.

00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:46.442
But none of that's going to happen

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.967
because of you, Matt, or should I say Ultra Kodex.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.882
MATT: (sinister laugh)

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.604
Affirma-tron, BlackWillow69.

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:58.224
That's what it says there.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.412
You never suspected that I, your best friend--

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:02.245
SAM: Well--

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:03.613
MATT: One of your best friends.

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:04.764
SAM: I mean--

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.515
MATT: Fine, close acquaintance.

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:10.374
You never suspected I was actually the Ultra Kodex all along

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:14.521
and now I'll decrypt to the quantum web forever.

00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:16.384
So Jack Zillow!

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:19.509
SAM: (offended) Oh!
MATT: Last words before you get fragged?

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.074
SAM: Yes.

00:01:21.074 --> 00:01:24.724
Tonight, you may slice one hacker from the net,

00:01:24.724 --> 00:01:27.044
but Kodex, you'll never truly win.

00:01:27.044 --> 00:01:29.214
The one thing you don't understand is the interwebs

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:33.234
isn't just techno punks like me ripping sick ciphers.

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:35.184
It isn't bits and bytes.

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:39.333
It isn't Pinterest and TikTok and Groupon and Plunker.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.214
MATT: What's Plunker?

00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:42.294
SAM: Oh, it's kind of like Instagram

00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:44.234
meets Animal Crossing meets Zoomquilt.

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:45.944
It's awesome. You know what? I'll send you an invite.

00:01:45.944 --> 00:01:46.924
MATT: Oh hell yeah, thank you.

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:47.884
SAM: Sure, no problem.

00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:50.364
Anyway, the Nordaverse can't be conquered

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:54.406
by one souped up virus slinger and his gorgeous cyber helmet

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.742
because the real root code

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.244
is inside of us.

00:01:58.244 --> 00:02:01.794
It's a web of friendships that brings humankind together.

00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:03.264
That's why we hack:

00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:07.029
not for the clout or the lulz or to steal Bitcoin, no!

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.694
We hack for love.

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:13.156
That's what NordVPN stands for.

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:16.264
MATT: (laughs) A rousing speech.

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:19.284
But it's too late, too leet!

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:21.334
I already offlined your partner,

00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:22.744
the only woman you've ever loved,

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:26.662
and now, BlackWillow, you're all alone.

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:29.387
Prepare to be deleted.

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:32.862
I'm going to-- here.

00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:33.827
I mean, here.

00:02:33.827 --> 00:02:34.669
(laughter)

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.060
MATT: Bah!

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.451
(laughter)

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.681

MARISHA: He's not alone.

00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.404
SAM: What?

00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:45.017
MATT: What? Marisha!

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:49.114
MARISHA: No, my username is TechnoSpice69.

00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:51.614
And with my 90s era hacker jams,

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:53.622
I'm going to fire up AOL instant messenger

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:54.954

MATT: But you're my wife.

But you lost all your data powers in a previous episode.

00:03:33.383 --> 00:03:34.933
Who gave them back to you?

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:36.422
TALIESIN: The same person who gave them to me

00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:39.013

You see, when one of us is in danger,

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:15.480

00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:33.674
to running a grimdark campaign. Hell yes.

00:08:33.674 --> 00:08:36.334
And you can check it out at ghostfiregaming.com.

00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:38.974

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:44.099
I actually really want to play that.

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:47.512
And of course, thank you to our friends at D&amp;D Beyond,

00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:50.271
our sponsors at the beginning of this campaign,

00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:53.201
the original tool set of D&amp;D and our show.

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.641
One of the cool things about
D&amp;D Beyond's master tier subscription

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.388
is that a DM can share the digital book library

00:08:58.388 --> 00:09:00.154
with anybody in their campaigns.

00:09:00.154 --> 00:09:01.384
So only one of you needs to get it.

00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:03.214
You can share it with everybody you're playing with

00:09:03.214 --> 00:09:04.174
in your campaign.

00:09:04.174 --> 00:09:08.387
So visit dndbeyond.link/master if you want to learn more.

00:09:09.512 --> 00:09:11.678
A couple other-- few more quick announcements.

00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:13.494
First off, thank you all for joining us here

00:09:13.494 --> 00:09:15.960
live on Twitch and YouTube.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.308

go ahead and head over to our Twitch channel,

00:09:20.365 --> 00:09:21.949
but thank you so much for checking in with us.

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:23.640
Laura, you got some things to chat about.

00:09:24.774 --> 00:09:27.623
LAURA: Hello, Bees is back!

00:09:27.623 --> 00:09:28.790
MATT: Yay!

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.906
LAURA: It's now available in the US store

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:33.977
and maybe in the UK store.

00:09:35.644 --> 00:09:39.385
It could be there right now, check it out.

00:09:40.377 --> 00:09:43.139
Check to see. You know we pre-record these episodes.

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:45.174
So I don't know things.

00:09:45.174 --> 00:09:46.694
It could be there.

00:09:46.694 --> 00:09:50.678
Check the store. Love you.

00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:52.504
That's my announcement.

00:09:52.504 --> 00:09:53.868
SAM: I thought you had two things?

00:09:53.868 --> 00:09:56.364
LAURA: No, it's all one thing.

00:09:56.364 --> 00:09:58.463
SAM: Oh, okay.
MATT: There we go.

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:01.794
TRAVIS: My head hurts so much.
You guys looked <i>so</i> dumb.

00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:03.137
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:04.695
MATT: I dare say, I think that--

00:10:04.695 --> 00:10:05.528
TRAVIS: No, it can't be.

00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:08.745
I need, like, five minutes.
MATT: --that ends our announcements.

00:10:08.745 --> 00:10:09.829
Better get ready quick, Travis,

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:11.271
because we're about to jump into

00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:15.234

MATT: And welcome back.

00:11:54.129 --> 00:11:56.329
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:11:56.329 --> 00:12:00.285
having absconded from Eiselcross to prepare

00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:04.735
and try and cut off the race against the Tomb Takers

00:12:04.735 --> 00:12:07.439
towards the center of the ruin, head to Nicodranas.

00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:10.886
Then a few other places, where they try and steal

00:12:10.886 --> 00:12:14.615
some necklaces to keep them hidden from the--

00:12:14.615 --> 00:12:16.930
hopefully the divining of Lucien

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.294
and the other magics that would wish to follow

00:12:20.294 --> 00:12:23.177
and peer into their goings on.

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:25.822
Upon breaking into the subterranean basement

00:12:25.822 --> 00:12:28.450
of a portion of the Vergesson Sanatorium,

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.009
they caused a ruckus

00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:32.140
and Master Trent Ikithon was summoned.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.271
Had a brief tense exchange.

00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:38.713
You escaped, and as such, a chase continued,

00:12:38.713 --> 00:12:41.234
as you seem to be hunted by this individual

00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:43.008
and the Cerberus Assembly.

00:12:43.008 --> 00:12:46.111
Grabbing some family members in Nicodranas,

00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:50.335
specifically the family of Veth Brenatto and Marion,

00:12:50.335 --> 00:12:54.067
the Ruby of the Sea, you went to Tidepeak Tower,

00:12:54.067 --> 00:12:56.187
tried to find a way out as it seemed Yussa

00:12:56.187 --> 00:12:59.288
was currently on, spiritually, another plane

00:12:59.288 --> 00:13:01.944
and could not give you aid.

00:13:01.944 --> 00:13:03.798
You managed to escape by sending some of you

00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:06.478
into the Happy Fun Ball, the Folding Halls of Halas,

00:13:06.478 --> 00:13:09.428
and some of you to an unfamiliar space,

00:13:09.428 --> 00:13:10.532
from what you came to discover to be

00:13:10.532 --> 00:13:13.179
the Elemental Plane of Fire.

00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:14.651
While you all managed to converge

00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:16.738
not without some temporary losses,

00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:19.357
one of which happened to be Veth's child,

00:13:19.357 --> 00:13:22.015
brought back from beyond the pale.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.940
You all gathered yourselves in Zadash,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.871
where you had, very last minute,

00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:33.021
let The Gentlemen know that you were arriving

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.600
with some people that needed to stay there.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.340
One of which the Ruby of the Sea,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.681
which has a old history with The Gentlemen.

00:13:44.105 --> 00:13:45.570
LAURA: I'm the old history.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.162
MATT: Yep, yep.

00:13:48.201 --> 00:13:50.993
We pick up as you all have just descended the stairs,

00:13:50.993 --> 00:13:55.612
the hubbub in the inside of the basement, the quarters

00:13:55.612 --> 00:14:00.087
of The Gentlemen beneath the Evening Nip.

00:14:00.087 --> 00:14:02.935
You see everyone scatter and turn as The Gentleman

00:14:02.935 --> 00:14:05.685
bows and says, "Welcome.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.930
"Welcome, friends. I am The Gentleman, a businessman

00:14:12.973 --> 00:14:16.926
"and occasional client of these Mighty Nein.

00:14:16.926 --> 00:14:20.178
"I appreciate privacy and discretion,

00:14:20.178 --> 00:14:22.548
"so please respect that during your stay," he says

00:14:22.548 --> 00:14:24.898
in the direction of the Brenattos.

00:14:26.222 --> 00:14:28.638
Looks towards Marion.

00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:34.900
"The famed Ruby of the Sea has
joined us as well for a spell.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.622
"Friends and esteemed business liaisons,

00:14:37.622 --> 00:14:42.097
"please make her feel welcome, lest you draw my wrath.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:48.550
"Come, come, settle in the space.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.808
"Drinks, anyone?"

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.889
You-- those of a decent passive perception

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:58.148
notice, like, he's a pretty damp fellow at most times,

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:01.635
but he is particularly drippy at the moment.

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:03.603
TRAVIS: Drippy.

00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:06.005
ASHLEY: Drippy drippy.
TRAVIS: Drippy drippy.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.255
LAURA: I squeeze my Mama's hand.

00:15:10.193 --> 00:15:12.852
MATT: She takes a moment.

00:15:14.027 --> 00:15:18.544
"Well, thank you, Gentlemen, very much for

00:15:19.783 --> 00:15:23.300
"taking us into your protected space for a time.

00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:27.277
"It's much appreciated."

00:15:28.137 --> 00:15:30.937
And he gives a nod.

00:15:32.425 --> 00:15:33.800
(The Gentleman clears his throat)

00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:38.564
"Well, (nervous laugh) come sit."

00:15:41.242 --> 00:15:43.139
And he scratches his head.

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:44.799
Everyone's looking at him from around the room,

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:45.632
waiting for something.

00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:47.037
TRAVIS: A round of drinks, I think, would be

00:15:47.037 --> 00:15:49.552
a good idea.
MATT: "Drinks sound fantastic.

00:15:49.552 --> 00:15:52.212
"I'll have one myself."

00:15:52.212 --> 00:15:53.927
And the bartender starts making the rounds

00:15:53.927 --> 00:15:55.871
and getting cups out, and people start

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:58.087
picking up a bit of a conversation.

00:15:58.087 --> 00:16:00.431
There's whispers around them as some folk settle back down,

00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:02.375
but all eyes are locked on all of you

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:04.017
and the new arrivals.

00:16:05.033 --> 00:16:07.098
Luc is still clutching on the edge

00:16:07.098 --> 00:16:10.028
of Caduceus' finger and looks over towards you

00:16:10.028 --> 00:16:11.217
and just goes--

00:16:11.217 --> 00:16:13.263
SAM: No, he hasn't taken a bath recently.

00:16:13.263 --> 00:16:15.005
That's just how he always looks.

00:16:15.005 --> 00:16:16.744
MATT: "Okay."
SAM: Yeah.

00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:18.100
MATT: "Do I have to take a bath?"

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.981
SAM: I mean, at some point, yes, we should get you a bath.

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:23.391
When's the last bath you had?

00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:27.257
MATT: Looks over to his dad and Yeza goes

00:16:27.257 --> 00:16:28.780
"It's not been <i>that</i> long."

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.613
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.821
You don't want to dry out his
hair or anything, but you know.

00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:33.187
MATT: "It's hard to wrestle down

00:16:33.187 --> 00:16:35.742
"when you're just one person.

00:16:35.742 --> 00:16:38.177
"But yeah, I think a bath soon would be good."

00:16:38.177 --> 00:16:40.528
SAM: That's a great idea.

00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:43.842
MATT: "So we're in, like, a bar under a bar?"

00:16:43.842 --> 00:16:47.394
SAM: Yes! Yes, it's a secret place,

00:16:47.394 --> 00:16:49.376
but they have good food here, and good drinks,

00:16:49.376 --> 00:16:52.338
and we'll get you a glass of milk

00:16:52.338 --> 00:16:55.272
and maybe they have some chicken fingers.

00:16:56.213 --> 00:16:57.054
LAURA: Yeah!

00:16:57.054 --> 00:16:59.226
MATT: At which point, immediately Luc's like, "What?"

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.734
SAM: Yeah.

00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:02.465
TALIESIN: They're not real fingers.

00:17:02.465 --> 00:17:04.228
SAM: Oh no, not real fingers, sorry, no.

00:17:04.228 --> 00:17:06.991
They're just in the shape of.

00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:09.085
MATT: "So it's like eating a finger?"

00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:11.256
SAM: Oh boy. (laughs)

00:17:11.256 --> 00:17:12.531
Yes, yeah.
MATT: "That's cool."

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.786
SAM: Yeah, and you can dip it in ketchup

00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:16.178
and it looks like blood.

00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:17.983
MATT: You hear this little voice on the side go like,

00:17:17.983 --> 00:17:21.733
(breathy chuckling)

00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:23.360
"Chicken fingers."

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.193
TRAVIS: What?

00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:28.140
MATT: And you recognize the creepy halfling individual

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.606
that works underneath The Gentleman

00:17:32.606 --> 00:17:33.793
who's just kind of,

00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:35.861
(excited, creepy chuckling)

00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:38.686
"You need food?"

00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:43.495
LAURA: I don't remember this guy. (laughs)

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:46.464
SAM: I feel like we would have remembered him.

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:49.996
ASHLEY: I'm so glad, 'cause I was like, "Dang, this guy."

00:17:49.996 --> 00:17:52.122
MATT: You've met him a couple of times.

00:17:52.122 --> 00:17:53.092
SAM: I'm looking, I'm looking.

00:17:53.092 --> 00:17:55.026
TALIESIN: I think a little bit of everything

00:17:55.026 --> 00:17:56.994
and learn to read the table.

00:17:56.994 --> 00:17:58.082
LIAM: That's right, Butterfingers.

00:17:58.082 --> 00:17:58.915
MATT: "Okay."

00:18:00.305 --> 00:18:02.561
And he wanders off.

00:18:02.561 --> 00:18:04.878
This is an odd, odd figure.

00:18:05.758 --> 00:18:08.216
LAURA: What's my mother look like right now?

00:18:08.216 --> 00:18:10.175
What is she doing?

00:18:10.175 --> 00:18:13.184
MATT: She's still standing next to you.

00:18:13.184 --> 00:18:16.781
She's holding your hand and

00:18:16.781 --> 00:18:19.940
you get the sense that she's waiting for your guidance.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.081
LAURA: I'm going to put my arm around her waist

00:18:23.081 --> 00:18:25.209
and whisper in her ear:

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:27.376
How are you, are you okay?

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:30.292
MATT: "I think so.

00:18:31.805 --> 00:18:34.805
"A lot has happened very quickly, and--"

00:18:36.003 --> 00:18:40.470
Her eyes are just locked on The Gentleman as he's

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.705
telling people to clean tables off

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.409
and getting a drink and you see him take a cup

00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:47.100
and take a glass,

00:18:48.937 --> 00:18:51.885
a giant glass jug of some sort of brackish liquor

00:18:51.885 --> 00:18:55.965
and just (liquid pouring) into his cup before

00:18:55.965 --> 00:18:58.062
takes a quick swig and gets him settled,

00:18:58.062 --> 00:19:01.672
turns around and she's just staring straight at him.

00:19:01.672 --> 00:19:03.672
LAURA: He seems nervous, Mama.

00:19:05.373 --> 00:19:07.040
MATT: "Can't imagine why."

00:19:07.894 --> 00:19:11.259
LAURA: Do you want to go sit at a corner table over there?

00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:14.109
I can send him over, or--

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:17.259
MATT: "Certainly."
LAURA: Okay.

00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:21.096
MATT: "Where is best to sit?"

00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:24.110
LAURA: I look for the most important-looking table,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.776
the most private-looking, important-looking.

00:19:25.776 --> 00:19:26.868
MATT: That's usually the one that he has

00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:27.950
in the far back left corner.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.765
LAURA: I'm going to send her right to his table, then.

00:19:29.765 --> 00:19:31.475
MATT: All right, she goes over and goes to sit

00:19:31.475 --> 00:19:35.561
and you can see two of the thug guards

00:19:35.561 --> 00:19:38.124
that were there look like they took some sort of

00:19:38.124 --> 00:19:39.951
series of cloth napkins and tucked them

00:19:39.951 --> 00:19:41.868
in the front of their pants to look like waiters.

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:45.325
And they're just like holding the chair for her.

00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:46.436
They're both looking at each other like,

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:49.424
"I don't know what I'm doing."

00:19:49.424 --> 00:19:53.045
As you're watching this, The Gentleman walks

00:19:53.045 --> 00:19:55.739
over towards you, crossing off

00:19:55.739 --> 00:19:58.404
your path as Marion goes and sits and goes,

00:19:58.404 --> 00:19:59.562
"Jester."

00:19:59.562 --> 00:20:01.148
LAURA: Hi, Papa.

00:20:01.148 --> 00:20:02.150
MATT: "Can I have a word with you?"

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.604
LAURA: Of course.

00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:05.620
MATT: "We'll be right back."

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.359
And he leads you up the staircase

00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:09.115
to his private chambers upstairs.

00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:11.818
And as you enter, he closes the door.

00:20:11.818 --> 00:20:13.093
(breathes heavily)

00:20:13.093 --> 00:20:14.457
"What have you done?"

00:20:14.457 --> 00:20:15.432
LAURA: Oh, well--

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:18.785
Oh no, you seem very upset.

00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:20.416
MATT: "I'm just a little caught off guard."

00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:21.802
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "I was not expecting this."

00:20:21.802 --> 00:20:23.304
LAURA: I know, I know, I know.

00:20:23.304 --> 00:20:24.569
MATT: "You brought her here?!"

00:20:24.569 --> 00:20:28.000
LAURA: Well, do you want to keep her safe or not?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.750
MATT: "Of course! I just--"

00:20:30.756 --> 00:20:32.391
LAURA: This is important!

00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:34.518
Do you think I would just willy-nilly bring her here?

00:20:34.518 --> 00:20:36.496
MATT: "Yes!"
LAURA: No!

00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.946
She's very scared of traveling.

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:41.054
This is very dire.

00:20:41.054 --> 00:20:42.029
MATT: "That's true."
LAURA: And you're the

00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:44.579
only person in the entire world

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:47.135
who could keep her safe right now.

00:20:47.135 --> 00:20:49.552
She needs you as a protector.

00:20:55.308 --> 00:20:58.475
Don't you want to keep the woman that you love

00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:01.775
more than anything in the entire universe safe?

00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:06.458
MATT: "Jester, it's been a very long time."

00:21:08.123 --> 00:21:09.684
LAURA: I'm not trying to set you up.

00:21:09.684 --> 00:21:12.151
I swear, I swear, I swear.

00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:17.001
Things are very bad right now. Super bad, okay?

00:21:17.918 --> 00:21:20.361
There are terrible people chasing after us.

00:21:20.361 --> 00:21:21.613
Don't worry, we're safe.

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:24.516
Check out my cool necklace.

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:29.133
Oh, this is lovely music you have in your room, Dad.

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:30.226
MATT: "Thank you, it was getting a bit loud.

00:21:30.226 --> 00:21:31.642
"I decided to go ahead and--"

00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:34.697
He claps, and the--

00:21:34.697 --> 00:21:37.797
SAM: Get out of here!
MATT: The shitty musicians outside change up.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:41.324
(laughter)
ASHLEY: We're just practicing!

00:21:43.624 --> 00:21:48.624
MATT: "I'm not going to deny anyone aid here,"

00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:54.971
He sits there and thinks for a second and goes,

00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:58.368
"And I suppose it is an oddly safe space to be."

00:21:58.368 --> 00:22:02.907
LAURA: It is. You're the first person I thought of.

00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:04.693
MATT: "Well, as long as we're not raided

00:22:04.693 --> 00:22:07.227
"by the High-Richter or anything, I suppose, but--"

00:22:07.227 --> 00:22:09.071
LAURA: Yeah, why would you be? (laughs)

00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:11.896
That would be crazy.
MATT: "Yeah."

00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:19.689
LAURA: Nobody knows we came here, I don't think.

00:22:19.689 --> 00:22:21.439
So everything's safe.

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:28.558
MATT: "What are you in?

00:22:28.558 --> 00:22:29.391
"What's happened?"

00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:31.335
LAURA: Oh god, so much.

00:22:31.335 --> 00:22:32.932
What have I told you?

00:22:32.932 --> 00:22:37.045
You remember Cree and how they had our blood,

00:22:37.045 --> 00:22:39.176
and how we had people after us?

00:22:39.176 --> 00:22:40.688
MATT: "Right, right."
LAURA: Well, that happened.

00:22:40.688 --> 00:22:43.163
We went up to the north, crazy crazy.

00:22:43.163 --> 00:22:45.004
And I fill him in on

00:22:45.004 --> 00:22:47.383
everything.
MATT: Pretty much everything?

00:22:47.383 --> 00:22:49.693
He still has his drink with him and just

00:22:49.693 --> 00:22:52.006
slumps into a chair and takes a heavy swig

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:54.274
and then sets it down on the nearby table

00:22:54.274 --> 00:22:56.732
on the side of his bed and goes,

00:22:56.732 --> 00:22:59.982
"My, you've all certainly been very busy.

00:23:04.142 --> 00:23:06.642
"Well, that's a lot of trouble."

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.941
LAURA: Yeah.

00:23:08.941 --> 00:23:12.726
MATT: "But you're certain that you weren't followed or--?"

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:15.380
LAURA: We have these necklaces now.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.122
Nobody saw us or were able to scry on us, you know,

00:23:18.122 --> 00:23:19.772
Mama's safe too, so.

00:23:21.245 --> 00:23:23.162
MATT: "All right, all right.

00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:29.732
"Assembly business is-- well, we avoid it for a reason,

00:23:30.621 --> 00:23:32.093
"but I trust you."

00:23:32.093 --> 00:23:33.360
LAURA: The Assembly is bad.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.451
Maybe they won't be in power for much longer,

00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:38.561
or at least not the same people.

00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:41.394
If everything goes well, at least.

00:23:45.554 --> 00:23:49.233
MATT: "Well then, how long do you expect

00:23:49.233 --> 00:23:52.066
"we need to entertain your guests?"

00:23:54.002 --> 00:23:55.419
LAURA: I have no idea.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.831
MATT: "You know the kind of work we do.

00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:03.481
"You know the kind of people I employ.

00:24:03.481 --> 00:24:07.898
"You've brought a child into a literal den of thieves."

00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:09.906
LAURA: I know.

00:24:11.482 --> 00:24:14.635
If we can, we'll try to find somewhere safe

00:24:14.635 --> 00:24:18.202
that's more appropriate for Luc and Yeza.

00:24:19.527 --> 00:24:22.694
I don't know when that will be, though.

00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:28.234
I'm hoping you can protect them

00:24:28.234 --> 00:24:33.234
from your own people as well.

00:24:33.341 --> 00:24:35.758
MATT: "Oh, that won't be an issue."

00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:41.984
You can see the weight on his shoulders

00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:44.406
as he contemplates and he takes a second.

00:24:44.406 --> 00:24:46.547
His eyes squint and he--

00:24:46.547 --> 00:24:48.942
You see him abacus counting

00:24:48.942 --> 00:24:50.850
in the middle of the air.

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:58.021
"Thankfully, we've made a decent mint

00:24:58.021 --> 00:24:59.805
"in the final months of the conflict,

00:24:59.805 --> 00:25:04.417
"so we aren't hurting for work at the time,

00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:06.213
"at least the kind of work that could get messy

00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:09.922
"in the presence of a child.

00:25:15.145 --> 00:25:16.686
"I don't believe I've ever

00:25:19.228 --> 00:25:21.219
"implemented a vacation

00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:25.148
"to my esteemed colleagues.

00:25:27.846 --> 00:25:29.763
"I'll see what I can do.

00:25:31.765 --> 00:25:32.973
"(sighs)

00:25:34.553 --> 00:25:37.161
"I apologize, this is just a lot very suddenly."

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:38.744
LAURA: I give him a hug.

00:25:40.402 --> 00:25:41.485
I know it is.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.710
It's so much for me to spring on you, and...

00:25:49.897 --> 00:25:51.480
you didn't even want to admit

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.323
you were my father not that long ago,

00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:55.873
and now I'm bringing all of this into your life.

00:25:58.721 --> 00:26:01.212
I'm thankful for everything you're doing for us,

00:26:01.212 --> 00:26:02.045
and I'm--

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.430
I'm proud to call you my dad.

00:26:15.153 --> 00:26:18.267
MATT: He just looks out for a second,

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.371
stroking his chin a bit,

00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:21.871
looks back at you.

00:26:36.204 --> 00:26:38.537
"It's hard to find the words.

00:26:44.021 --> 00:26:46.129
"I can't say I'm a proud father.

00:26:46.129 --> 00:26:48.046
"I've not been a father.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.721
"Can't say I've been a proud influence.

00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:55.971
"I'm a criminal.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:05.433
"And I can't say that I've lived up to her expectations.

00:27:06.461 --> 00:27:07.294
"I'm a cad.

00:27:12.414 --> 00:27:17.006
"So I don't have any expectations.

00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:25.311
"But I'll do my best to keep them safe."

00:27:25.311 --> 00:27:27.061
LAURA: She doesn't either.

00:27:29.838 --> 00:27:32.088
She trusted me to come here

00:27:33.912 --> 00:27:35.995
and I'm thankful for that.

00:27:40.249 --> 00:27:44.296
But she's just as nervous as you are.

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:45.713
Trust me on that.

00:27:47.991 --> 00:27:50.811
MATT: "Why, whatever for?" and he gestures

00:27:50.811 --> 00:27:53.751
out to the balcony where you can see half of his staff

00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:55.583
are all standing there

00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:58.605
looking at each other awkwardly, not knowing what to do.

00:27:58.605 --> 00:28:00.538
Tattoos up the arms.

00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:02.407
Some of them, all manner of scars,

00:28:02.407 --> 00:28:04.525
still existing, non-cleaned bloodstains

00:28:04.525 --> 00:28:06.072
on parts of their clothing.

00:28:06.072 --> 00:28:08.322
LAURA: Please, you think Mama's not used

00:28:08.322 --> 00:28:09.870
to seeing all of this stuff?

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.300
You know what she does.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.533
You know the kind of people she's been working with before.

00:28:16.546 --> 00:28:17.963
Just talk to her.

00:28:20.784 --> 00:28:22.669
MATT: "If she wishes to talk to me."

00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:24.409
LAURA: Ugh.

00:28:25.809 --> 00:28:28.642
MATT: "Don't roll your eyes at me, Jester."

00:28:29.779 --> 00:28:30.612
LAURA: Never.

00:28:31.694 --> 00:28:32.686
MATT: "You literally just did."

00:28:32.686 --> 00:28:33.519
LAURA: No, I didn't!

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:35.709
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:36.617
(clears throat)

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.120
MATT: "That's better."

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.120
LAURA: Thank you.

00:28:42.249 --> 00:28:44.307
MATT: He finishes his drink rapidly.

00:28:44.307 --> 00:28:45.390
Sets it down.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.287
"How do I look?"

00:28:50.557 --> 00:28:51.390
LAURA: Maybe change your shirt.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.267
It's kind of drenched.
MATT: "Shit, shit."

00:28:54.267 --> 00:28:56.128
He runs off to his cupboard

00:28:56.128 --> 00:28:58.281
and starts trying on different outfits like, "This one?

00:28:58.281 --> 00:28:59.947
"Is it too much blue?"
LAURA: Ooh no, no, no.

00:28:59.947 --> 00:29:00.780
MATT: "It's blue on blue on blue."

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.324
LAURA: No, it's nice, it's dark color, it's good.

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:06.645
MATT: "Like an accent, primary popping, I don't--"

00:29:06.645 --> 00:29:07.478
LAURA: One more button.

00:29:07.478 --> 00:29:09.632
Just button one more, yeah.

00:29:09.632 --> 00:29:10.776
Okay, now go.

00:29:10.776 --> 00:29:13.266
MATT: "All right."
LAURA: Don't think about it.

00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:14.182
MATT: He goes and opens the door

00:29:14.182 --> 00:29:15.814
and takes a step out and stops,

00:29:15.814 --> 00:29:19.514
and turns back and looks over his shoulder at you and goes,

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:24.492
"Be careful.

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:29.916
"Whatever you're doing, all of this,

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:35.622
"it's an unkind world out there."

00:29:37.026 --> 00:29:37.859
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:39.642 --> 00:29:41.090
I will.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.840
MATT: "You're too good for most of it."

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.587
And he steps out.

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:50.670
"My apologies! I just had to tend to--"

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:51.930
and he starts heading down the stairs

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.525
leaving you alone in the upstairs chamber

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:55.942
with the door partially ajar.

00:29:58.898 --> 00:30:00.498
SAM: Oh lord.
LAURA: (laughs)

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:02.248
SAM: Oh boy, don't open those drawers.

00:30:02.248 --> 00:30:04.471
(laughter)

00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:07.621
LAURA: (excited squealing) What could I do in here?

00:30:11.929 --> 00:30:13.900
Going to peek under the bed.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.255
MATT: Okay.

00:30:15.255 --> 00:30:16.178
SAM: (deep voice) Hey, how you doing?

00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:19.191
(laughter)

00:30:19.191 --> 00:30:20.925
LIAM: No room, no room.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.253
MATT: Modify Memory.

00:30:24.253 --> 00:30:27.299
(laughter)

00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:28.132
MATT: Peeking under the bed.

00:30:28.132 --> 00:30:32.732
It looks to be a handful of cushions

00:30:32.732 --> 00:30:35.401
cursorily pushed beneath it.

00:30:35.401 --> 00:30:37.899
LAURA: Oh, oh! The big ruby that I gave him,

00:30:37.899 --> 00:30:39.454
is it still here?

00:30:39.454 --> 00:30:41.033
Is it next to his bed?

00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:42.768
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

00:30:45.018 --> 00:30:46.965
SAM: Big roll, big roll.

00:30:46.965 --> 00:30:48.182
LAURA: 16!

00:30:48.182 --> 00:30:49.104
MATT: Glancing about the room,

00:30:49.104 --> 00:30:51.707
you do not immediately see it.

00:30:51.707 --> 00:30:53.017
LAURA: Drawers, drawers, drawers.

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:55.113
MATT: You just start going-- okay.

00:30:55.113 --> 00:30:57.305
LAURA: I want to find it and try to put it next to his bed

00:30:57.305 --> 00:30:59.110
and-- oh, I'm going to pull out--

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.876
I'm going to make a drawing of Mama

00:31:01.876 --> 00:31:03.809
and sit it next to his bed.

00:31:04.936 --> 00:31:09.429
MATT: Okay, going through the drawers you discover

00:31:09.429 --> 00:31:10.565
a flintlock pistol.
SAM: Magic paint

00:31:10.565 --> 00:31:13.854
and it becomes a real thing, a real person.

00:31:13.854 --> 00:31:16.825
MATT: An actual pistol with ammunition

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:18.614
and a little, tiny box next to it

00:31:18.614 --> 00:31:23.202
in one shelf unit underneath a desk area.

00:31:23.202 --> 00:31:26.242
You can see there is a fake drawer

00:31:26.242 --> 00:31:27.695
underneath the desk as well,

00:31:27.695 --> 00:31:29.207
where it looks like a stiletto blade

00:31:29.207 --> 00:31:32.475
is bolted up into it.

00:31:32.475 --> 00:31:36.837
Next to his bedside table there's a small, little

00:31:36.837 --> 00:31:39.474
octagonal cabinet with different sides on it.

00:31:39.474 --> 00:31:41.708
It has a drawer on top and as you open it up,

00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:43.649
the inside, you see another dagger,

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:47.194
a small snuff box of some kind,

00:31:47.194 --> 00:31:49.519
and the ruby you're seeking.

00:31:50.398 --> 00:31:52.521
LAURA: Well, at least it was close to the bed.

00:31:52.521 --> 00:31:53.620
Put it on the shelf.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.732
Oh, and I'll draw the little--

00:31:54.732 --> 00:31:56.086
and I'll put the ruby on it.

00:31:56.086 --> 00:31:58.372
Like artfully, you know, like Pinteresty

00:31:58.372 --> 00:32:00.863
so it's like--

00:32:00.863 --> 00:32:01.878
MATT: Dressing the window.

00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:03.004
Presentation of it.
LAURA: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:03.849
MATT: Okay.

00:32:03.849 --> 00:32:04.788
LAURA: If his room is messy, though,

00:32:04.788 --> 00:32:07.570
I'm going to hide things just in case, you know,

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.831
she comes up here or something.

00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:10.369
MATT: Okay, you get the sense that everything in here

00:32:10.369 --> 00:32:13.210
was rapidly cleaned.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.463
LAURA: Already?

00:32:14.463 --> 00:32:16.452
MATT: But in the way that a 13-year old

00:32:16.452 --> 00:32:17.806
prepares his room rapidly, where like,

00:32:17.806 --> 00:32:19.495
once again, underneath the bed,

00:32:19.495 --> 00:32:20.898
underneath and behind stuff,

00:32:20.898 --> 00:32:22.718
he's crammed things.

00:32:22.718 --> 00:32:25.329
Just discarded outfits.

00:32:25.329 --> 00:32:28.536
You know, anything that would've probably been just dropped

00:32:28.536 --> 00:32:30.901
and left along the floor has been just shunted

00:32:30.901 --> 00:32:35.243
into little pocket spaces to make it look clean at the time.

00:32:35.243 --> 00:32:36.468
LAURA: That's appropriate.

00:32:36.468 --> 00:32:39.793
And the snuff box is actually just snuff in there?

00:32:41.012 --> 00:32:41.845
MATT: You open it up?

00:32:41.845 --> 00:32:42.686
LAURA: Yeah.

00:32:42.686 --> 00:32:43.753
MATT: There is a material in there,

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:46.219
a blue crystalline substance.

00:32:48.098 --> 00:32:50.098
LAURA: Does it look familiar?

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.010
MATT: Go ahead and make a

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.088
history or arcana check.

00:32:56.088 --> 00:32:57.262
LIAM: You should smell it just to be sure.

00:32:57.262 --> 00:32:58.929
LAURA: See, I'm scared to.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

00:33:00.255 --> 00:33:01.802
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:33:01.802 --> 00:33:03.270
LIAM: Powdered paste.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.757
LAURA: Ooh, 20.

00:33:04.757 --> 00:33:06.290
MATT: 20!

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.487
This is suude.

00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:09.520
LAURA: (gasps)

00:33:10.946 --> 00:33:12.437
Yeah, well.

00:33:12.437 --> 00:33:15.153
I'll close it, and shut the drawer.

00:33:15.153 --> 00:33:17.320
Yeah, no, that's fine, okay.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.004
I'm going to go.

00:33:19.004 --> 00:33:21.337
MATT: Okay, for the rest of you,

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:27.404
as they wander off, you can see the room,

00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:28.897
which is very different from pretty much

00:33:28.897 --> 00:33:29.934
any time you've been there.

00:33:29.934 --> 00:33:32.156
And there is this unique circumstance

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:33.581
where all these people that generally keep

00:33:33.581 --> 00:33:36.355
a very rough and checking in

00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:39.852
with a territorial presentation with the rest of you

00:33:39.852 --> 00:33:43.966
are now at attention. looking at you like, "Don't judge,"

00:33:43.966 --> 00:33:46.213
and just looking about making eye contact,

00:33:46.213 --> 00:33:49.131
and then (clears throat).

00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:53.285
As Marion is seated and they give a table

00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:55.774
to you and your family.

00:33:55.774 --> 00:34:00.582
Cups are placed out and they start pouring drinks for you,

00:34:00.582 --> 00:34:02.015
your husband, and your kid,

00:34:02.015 --> 00:34:04.682
before the guy's like, "No, no, dumb, wait.

00:34:04.682 --> 00:34:05.731
"No, sorry.

00:34:08.618 --> 00:34:09.915
"We have milk."

00:34:09.915 --> 00:34:10.931
And one of the other guys goes like,

00:34:10.931 --> 00:34:13.088
"I think we got cheese."

00:34:13.088 --> 00:34:14.512
ALL: Ew.

00:34:14.512 --> 00:34:16.946
LAURA: Just water is good.

00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:18.977
Or juice, yeah, any sort of juice,

00:34:18.977 --> 00:34:22.406
maybe even in a shot glass is fine.

00:34:22.406 --> 00:34:23.239
MATT: "I'll be right back.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.741
"I got to make a quick run."

00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:26.546
TALIESIN: A carafe, a carafe.

00:34:26.546 --> 00:34:28.546
MATT: One of the guys exits.

00:34:29.425 --> 00:34:33.203
Most the juices they have here are fermented, it seems.

00:34:33.203 --> 00:34:36.376
But nevertheless, you guys are left within the chamber.

00:34:36.376 --> 00:34:40.803
Some of them begin bringing these really shabby

00:34:40.803 --> 00:34:43.791
wooden platters that have semi-stale bread

00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:44.916
but it's been cracked open.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:47.472
They're trying to make a good looking spread.

00:34:47.472 --> 00:34:49.202
LAURA: That's so sweet.

00:34:49.202 --> 00:34:51.440
MATT: With whatever they could find on short notice.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.432
And so it's a bunch of shitty, scavenged bar food

00:34:56.432 --> 00:34:59.599
that's arranged in a little platter.

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:02.099
Marion's like, "Oh my goodness, thank you.

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:04.884
"You didn't have to break out the good salt."

00:35:04.884 --> 00:35:06.025
TRAVIS: (laughs) The good salt.

00:35:06.025 --> 00:35:08.092
(laughter)

00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:10.968
LIAM: In the time that lapsed, I have taken

00:35:10.968 --> 00:35:13.520
some of my silver thread and tied it around

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.701
one of my black raven's feathers that I use for flying

00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:19.884
and under the table I rubbed some of my catmint

00:35:19.884 --> 00:35:22.287
on the feather, and say: Hey Luc,

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:24.157
you want to see something crazy?

00:35:24.157 --> 00:35:26.147
MATT: "What?"
LIAM: I hand him the thread.

00:35:26.147 --> 00:35:28.397
Go dangle that over my cat. (foomph)

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:32.194
It's covered in catnip.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.963
MATT: So you've all, at different points in time,

00:35:39.963 --> 00:35:43.304
seen varying degrees of emotion and energy levels

00:35:43.304 --> 00:35:44.504
from Frumpkin.

00:35:45.735 --> 00:35:50.552
This is a feral demon energy from the fey cat

00:35:50.552 --> 00:35:53.894
who just starts going crazy on the string.

00:35:56.033 --> 00:35:58.666
MARISHA: Why's he making that howling noise?

00:35:58.666 --> 00:35:59.841
MATT: Luc is just enraptured

00:35:59.841 --> 00:36:01.007
and pulling and tugging on it.

00:36:01.007 --> 00:36:03.243
And they're both just having a good time

00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:05.219
at the side of the table.

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:07.219
Yeza's looking around.

00:36:08.273 --> 00:36:10.491
"All right, so we're staying here for a while."

00:36:10.491 --> 00:36:13.030
SAM: I think so, or in a safe house,

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:17.004
if The Gentleman deems that you know, more appropriate,

00:36:17.004 --> 00:36:19.212
but yes, we need to stay out of sight

00:36:19.212 --> 00:36:20.862
and this seems like an appropriate--

00:36:20.862 --> 00:36:22.490
MATT: Waves to somebody else over there

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:24.198
who just goes--

00:36:27.813 --> 00:36:29.636
It's such a--
SAM: Maybe don't make eye contact.

00:36:29.636 --> 00:36:31.377
MATT: "Oh, okay, I didn't know.

00:36:32.747 --> 00:36:36.049
"Well, thank you, or Jester or whoever else."

00:36:36.049 --> 00:36:38.452
SAM: Yeah, I think this is on Jester.

00:36:38.452 --> 00:36:42.142
I hope it's all right with The Gentleman.

00:36:42.142 --> 00:36:43.698
MATT: "Okay."

00:36:43.698 --> 00:36:46.279
SAM: He seems nice today.

00:36:46.279 --> 00:36:48.421
He's nice. He's been nice to us.

00:36:49.697 --> 00:36:51.297
MATT: "Wow, um.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.457
"Sorry, I'm still processing

00:36:55.457 --> 00:36:56.694
"everything that's happened."

00:36:56.694 --> 00:36:57.699
SAM: Yeah, of course.

00:36:57.699 --> 00:36:59.935
So we got out of there super fast.

00:36:59.935 --> 00:37:02.408
I'm so sorry about that.

00:37:02.408 --> 00:37:04.924
I mean, I'm talking about back at Nicodranas

00:37:04.924 --> 00:37:06.232
not the other place,

00:37:06.232 --> 00:37:10.706
but I know you guys don't have any clothes or anything.

00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:13.223
Maybe we can make some arrangements

00:37:14.226 --> 00:37:16.643
to get some brought over, and

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:21.544
you left out some food for the pup, right?

00:37:21.544 --> 00:37:22.544
For the dog?

00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:24.248
MATT: "Yeah.

00:37:26.006 --> 00:37:26.922
"Oh no.

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:30.496
"I didn't, we just rushed. I didn't even--"

00:37:30.496 --> 00:37:32.584
SAM: Of course, yeah, why would you have?

00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:34.285
ASHLEY: You have a dog?

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:36.913
SAM: I mean, it's not my dog.

00:37:36.913 --> 00:37:37.746
MATT: "Um."

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.436
At which point, Luc's playing with the cat, goes,

00:37:43.436 --> 00:37:44.589
"Where's Nugget?"

00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:45.422
SAM: Oh boy.

00:37:45.422 --> 00:37:46.422
MATT: Yeza goes,

00:37:49.787 --> 00:37:53.178
"Nugget's on an adventure, like your Mama."

00:37:53.178 --> 00:37:55.153
SAM: You know what the great part about Nugget is?

00:37:55.153 --> 00:37:57.554
He can disappear and reappear other places,

00:37:57.554 --> 00:37:59.801
so he can get out and he can get food

00:37:59.801 --> 00:38:01.543
and go to the bathroom and stuff.

00:38:01.543 --> 00:38:03.152
He doesn't always have to shit in our house

00:38:03.152 --> 00:38:04.801
like he normally does.

00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:05.876
TRAVIS: Send him a message.

00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:08.017
MATT: "No, he's actually taken to

00:38:08.017 --> 00:38:11.029
"taking a poop in all of our neighbors houses, too."

00:38:11.029 --> 00:38:12.400
SAM: Oh!
MATT: "Yeah."

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.354
SAM: That's a good trick.

00:38:13.354 --> 00:38:15.118
MATT: "Yeah, it's a lot of great conversations I've had

00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:16.081
"for the past couple weeks."

00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:16.914
SAM: Oh no.

00:38:16.914 --> 00:38:18.504
ASHLEY: Maybe the neighbors are giving him food.

00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:20.192
SAM: Probably.

00:38:20.192 --> 00:38:22.664
MATT: "If not, he's taking it.

00:38:22.664 --> 00:38:25.037
"Blink dogs are a lot, aren't they, Luc?"

00:38:25.037 --> 00:38:27.522
He's like, "He's so funny."

00:38:27.522 --> 00:38:30.997
And keeps playing with Frumpkin with the string.

00:38:30.997 --> 00:38:32.176
Yeza's like,

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:34.110
"Okay, well, we'll have to tackle that problem

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:34.943
"when we get to it."

00:38:34.943 --> 00:38:36.985
SAM: You know, Jester might be able to send a message

00:38:36.985 --> 00:38:40.412
to someone in Nicodranas to go check in on the dog.

00:38:40.412 --> 00:38:41.708
MATT: "Maybe, that might be helpful."

00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:43.044
SAM: Yeah.

00:38:43.044 --> 00:38:44.516
MATT: "Oh boy."

00:38:44.516 --> 00:38:45.482
SAM: I'm sure she knows,

00:38:45.482 --> 00:38:48.199
or Marion might know a sitter of some sort.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.903
MATT: "Okay." He grabs his cup.

00:38:53.073 --> 00:38:56.693
SAM: But yeah, we'll just stay here until we figure out

00:38:56.693 --> 00:38:58.810
what the next plan is.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:03.544
Everyone, what is the next plan, do we know?

00:39:05.328 --> 00:39:06.536
Oh.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:39:08.676 --> 00:39:11.102
Going to the Grove.

00:39:11.102 --> 00:39:13.165
I think that's the next stop.

00:39:13.165 --> 00:39:16.175
Do we have some business to take care of here still?

00:39:16.175 --> 00:39:18.259
LIAM: I think we're doing it right now.

00:39:20.276 --> 00:39:24.355
I'm ready. I mean, not this moment, but I'm set for the day.

00:39:25.247 --> 00:39:28.787
Do you have anything from home on your person?

00:39:28.787 --> 00:39:30.341
TALIESIN: Everything.

00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:31.309
What do you need?

00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:33.538
LIAM: Just an object.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.371
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:36.038
LIAM: From the house you grew up in,

00:39:36.038 --> 00:39:37.605
or nearby.

00:39:38.658 --> 00:39:42.058
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's practically everything I own.

00:39:42.058 --> 00:39:44.891
LIAM: Just to avoid mishap on arrival.

00:39:45.938 --> 00:39:47.412
TALIESIN: Let me see what I got.

00:39:47.412 --> 00:39:51.073
SAM: What time is it, ish?

00:39:51.073 --> 00:39:52.909
MATT: Let's see, you guys returned--

00:39:52.909 --> 00:39:53.807
LIAM: It is exactly...

00:39:55.973 --> 00:39:59.457
MATT: I'll say roughly early afternoon.

00:40:02.315 --> 00:40:04.533
SAM: I mean, we're not going to go right this second, right?

00:40:04.533 --> 00:40:07.716
We're going to spend a day and night here, at least?

00:40:07.716 --> 00:40:10.959
LAURA: How many days have passed since we left Eiselcross?

00:40:10.959 --> 00:40:12.917
SAM: Good question.

00:40:12.917 --> 00:40:14.867
MATT: Somewhere in the neighborhood of

00:40:14.867 --> 00:40:16.997
three to four, I think.

00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.342
TALIESIN: That's, yeah.

00:40:18.342 --> 00:40:21.618
LAURA: They said two weeks thereabouts, but we're

00:40:21.618 --> 00:40:23.284
playing it safe.
MATT: Somewhere between a week and two weeks.

00:40:23.284 --> 00:40:25.263
LIAM: Yeah, we were talking about a week to play it safe.

00:40:25.263 --> 00:40:26.829
LAURA: Yeah.

00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:28.801
LIAM: I feel like it should be our last stop.

00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:30.282
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:40:30.282 --> 00:40:34.699
LIAM: So I think we should go there at the end of the day

00:40:36.039 --> 00:40:37.678
with enough time for--

00:40:37.678 --> 00:40:39.024
TALIESIN: Whatever we're going to find there.

00:40:39.024 --> 00:40:41.995
LIAM: --going to find, and then we need to rest again

00:40:41.995 --> 00:40:45.113
so that we can depart promptly.

00:40:45.113 --> 00:40:47.093
TALIESIN: Do we need supplies before we go?

00:40:48.859 --> 00:40:52.942
I'd never say no to a few different things.

00:40:56.622 --> 00:40:59.715
SAM: We're near Pumat, right?

00:40:59.715 --> 00:41:02.402
LAURA: Yeah, did we have anything left that we were

00:41:02.402 --> 00:41:03.927
getting Pumat to make?

00:41:05.022 --> 00:41:05.899
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:41:05.899 --> 00:41:07.150
LAURA: We didn't have him making anything custom

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:08.721
that we left with them last time, right?

00:41:08.721 --> 00:41:13.599
SAM: I think I had him making a rosé flask.

00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:14.432
MATT: Yes.

00:41:14.432 --> 00:41:17.005
LAURA: (laughs) That seems important now.

00:41:17.005 --> 00:41:17.838
SAM: Definitely.

00:41:17.838 --> 00:41:19.004
MATT: Which you could go pick up,

00:41:19.004 --> 00:41:20.228
likely while you're in town.

00:41:20.228 --> 00:41:21.177
SAM: Cool.

00:41:21.177 --> 00:41:24.053
MATT: (laughs)

00:41:24.053 --> 00:41:26.820
TRAVIS: Maybe he'll have a ring of ice resistance.

00:41:29.269 --> 00:41:31.122
Make a trade.

00:41:31.122 --> 00:41:32.297
MATT: Hey man,

00:41:32.297 --> 00:41:34.647
the fire elemental plane battle--
TRAVIS: Don't you "hey man" me!

00:41:34.647 --> 00:41:36.477
(fake sobbing)

00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:44.077
MATT: As you guys are sitting and having this conversation

00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:50.201
some of the individuals begin to shrug back a bit

00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:52.657
and nod and scatter off and head into

00:41:52.657 --> 00:41:55.323
small side rooms or head back up the stairs

00:41:55.323 --> 00:41:57.708
as The Gentleman reenters the chamber.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.196
Catching up where he left Jester's conversation there.

00:42:03.196 --> 00:42:04.661
"Welcome to stay as long as you need.

00:42:04.661 --> 00:42:08.005
"You're under the protection of The Gentleman.

00:42:08.005 --> 00:42:09.238
"Need not worry.

00:42:10.339 --> 00:42:14.727
"The Mighty Nein, I believe. Jester tells me you're about to

00:42:14.727 --> 00:42:16.461
"probably head off before the day is done

00:42:16.461 --> 00:42:18.941
"to continue your business up north, yes?"

00:42:20.411 --> 00:42:22.341
MARISHA: Sounding likely at this point, yeah.

00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:23.381
TALIESIN: Very likely.

00:42:23.381 --> 00:42:24.864
MATT: "All right, all right, well,

00:42:26.021 --> 00:42:28.961
"do not worry, we will keep a vigilant watch

00:42:29.911 --> 00:42:33.371
"on your families, I guess,"

00:42:33.371 --> 00:42:36.121
and he looks over towards Marion for a second and nods.

00:42:37.031 --> 00:42:39.831
"Plenty of time for us to share stories and catch up,

00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:42.859
"should anyone be interested."

00:42:44.542 --> 00:42:46.091
LAURA: (giggles)

00:42:46.091 --> 00:42:49.751
MATT: "Down time. The rest of you, take the day off."

00:42:49.751 --> 00:42:52.211
They're like, "What?

00:42:52.211 --> 00:42:53.061
"What's that even mean?"

00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:56.357
He's like, "Go, uh-- here,"

00:42:56.357 --> 00:42:58.981
and he goes and points to one of the guys inside.

00:42:58.981 --> 00:42:59.814
He goes like--

00:42:59.814 --> 00:43:01.231
(whispers)

00:43:01.231 --> 00:43:02.531
And a guy on the side you see,

00:43:02.531 --> 00:43:05.061
who's carrying a small satchel goes

00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:06.721
and starts like putting coins in the hands

00:43:06.721 --> 00:43:07.554
of each of the workers.

00:43:07.554 --> 00:43:09.651
He goes like, "Consider this a bonus

00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:11.411
"for all the hard work you've done.

00:43:11.411 --> 00:43:13.021
"Take this, don't spend it all in one place,

00:43:13.021 --> 00:43:14.011
"or do so, I don't care.

00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:15.791
"But just take the day for yourselves,

00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:18.821
"journey about Zadash, and make it your own.

00:43:18.821 --> 00:43:20.679
"(nervous laugh)"

00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:22.513
They all kind of, "Okay."

00:43:22.513 --> 00:43:25.181
MARISHA: You should do the haunted Zadash tour, actually,

00:43:25.181 --> 00:43:26.958
highly recommended.

00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:29.101
Did that the first year I was at Cobalt Soul.

00:43:29.101 --> 00:43:30.801
MATT: They all turn and look at one guy there,

00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:33.081
who's this shrimpy looking,

00:43:33.081 --> 00:43:34.671
Ichabod Crane fellow who's like,

00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:36.172
"Oh no, I'm not doing that again."

00:43:36.172 --> 00:43:37.700
(laughter)

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.748
They're like, "No, we're doing it,"

00:43:38.748 --> 00:43:39.741
and they grab him and he's like,

00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:41.593
"No, I don't want to do that again!"

00:43:41.593 --> 00:43:42.584
And they start dragging him off

00:43:42.584 --> 00:43:44.181
as they all begin to exit out.

00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:45.581
Except for the large ogre guard

00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:46.414
who's still sitting there,

00:43:46.414 --> 00:43:48.161
who's half-asleep in the back

00:43:48.161 --> 00:43:50.901
who has a little makeshift bow tie on,

00:43:50.901 --> 00:43:53.134
but it's way too small on him.

00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:56.386
TALIESIN: Ask for Andrew, never mind.

00:43:56.386 --> 00:43:57.711
Andrew's the guy--

00:43:57.711 --> 00:43:59.131
That's okay.

00:43:59.131 --> 00:44:00.915
LIAM: It was actually Travis they just dragged off.

00:44:00.915 --> 00:44:02.011
(laughter)

00:44:02.011 --> 00:44:03.124
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.

00:44:05.384 --> 00:44:10.384
MATT: Yeza goes, "Well, greatly appreciated, Mr. Gentleman.

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.731
"The Gentleman?"

00:44:11.731 --> 00:44:12.564
SAM: Mr. The?

00:44:13.441 --> 00:44:15.531
MATT: "Mr. The, is that what--"

00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:17.381
(as The Gentleman) "Gentleman's fine."

00:44:17.381 --> 00:44:21.291
(as Yeza) "Right, well, on behalf of the Brenatto family

00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:23.991
"we're just very thankful for the safe

00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:27.021
"protection that you're offering,

00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:29.931
"and if we can be of service whatsoever in this space,

00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:32.166
"we do have a number of skills."

00:44:32.166 --> 00:44:35.316
(as The Gentleman) "Interesting.
What kind of skills do you have, I might ask?"

00:44:35.316 --> 00:44:40.316
SAM: Well, my son is a
very talented sneaker and swiper and--

00:44:40.508 --> 00:44:43.811
MATT: (as Yeza) "(stammering) He is far too young."

00:44:43.811 --> 00:44:46.891
SAM: But Yeza also has his own talents.

00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:49.318
He's excellent with chemistry and mixing--

00:44:49.318 --> 00:44:50.841
MATT: Luc goes, "I can shoot stuff!"

00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:51.908
He's like, "Shh!

00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:57.811
"I indeed am an accomplished alchemist

00:44:57.811 --> 00:45:00.912
"and have experience with all number of various components."

00:45:00.912 --> 00:45:03.687
"and have experience with all number of various components."

00:45:03.687 --> 00:45:07.591
SAM: If you had anything that you needed mixed or unmixed,

00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:09.190
you know, he's your fella.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.834
MATT: And The Gentleman sits back
and looks back like, "(impressed) Hmm!

00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:15.401
"Very well, I'm not here to put you to work,

00:45:15.401 --> 00:45:18.211
"but if you're offering, to pass the time, at least,

00:45:18.211 --> 00:45:20.474
"make yourself some coin under our umbrella.

00:45:21.651 --> 00:45:23.814
"Heck," and he looks at him for a second,

00:45:24.971 --> 00:45:27.151
"Good to tell your kids some point down the line maybe,

00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:29.343
"that you got to work for a criminal."

00:45:30.581 --> 00:45:32.081
And Yeza goes like, "Well, no, I--"

00:45:33.591 --> 00:45:36.491
SAM: Do you have a sleeping quarters here, Gentlemen,

00:45:36.491 --> 00:45:39.341
that that would be appropriate for us?

00:45:39.341 --> 00:45:42.071
MATT: "Yes, yes, I have a room currently being prepared."

00:45:42.071 --> 00:45:43.351
SAM: Oh!

00:45:43.351 --> 00:45:45.161
MATT: You hear some shifting in the back room

00:45:45.161 --> 00:45:47.451
of like barrels screeching.

00:45:48.868 --> 00:45:49.891
And you get the sense they're clearing out

00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:51.841
one of the store rooms or making space.

00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:54.931
SAM: Thank you. Much, much appreciated.

00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:56.081
MATT: "Of course, of course.

00:45:58.681 --> 00:46:01.981
"But for the rest of you who are making your journey,

00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:04.691
"I wish you all the greatest of luck.

00:46:04.691 --> 00:46:06.871
"And please come back with stories.

00:46:06.871 --> 00:46:10.131
"And if you find anything particularly of

00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:14.081
"curious interest that you think might fetch a pretty penny,

00:46:14.081 --> 00:46:17.201
"I can connect you with some buyers.

00:46:17.201 --> 00:46:18.034
"So let me know."

00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:20.221
SAM: Do we have anything?

00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:24.001
TALIESIN: I actually have a thought, a question.

00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:26.674
Did Cree live here?

00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:28.951
MATT: "No, no, no, no."

00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:32.064
TALIESIN: Okay, so Cree didn't leave anything behind?

00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:35.531
MATT: "No, no she just up and left."

00:46:36.854 --> 00:46:38.351
TALIESIN: Well, it was worth a shot.

00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:40.581
MATT: "Sorry, yeah no, I don't have enough rooms

00:46:40.581 --> 00:46:43.921
"to house my entire organization,

00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:45.601
"but there are a few that can stay here if need be.

00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:48.331
"And we do offer to those who need it, safe house

00:46:49.581 --> 00:46:52.924
"detailing like you've requested.

00:46:54.861 --> 00:46:56.004
"But happy to oblige.

00:46:57.331 --> 00:46:58.381
"But please stay safe.

00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:02.511
"And we'll take care of things."

00:47:02.511 --> 00:47:04.531
He looks back and sees you coming down the stairs

00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:06.189
now after you've rummaged through his room.

00:47:06.189 --> 00:47:07.694
LAURA: Skip, skip, skip.

00:47:08.591 --> 00:47:11.239
I give him a wink. Skip, skip, skip.

00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:13.201
MATT: He gives like a, "(nervous laugh)"
LAURA: (giggles)

00:47:14.261 --> 00:47:16.054
MATT: "Well, and to Jester as well,

00:47:18.561 --> 00:47:19.752
"keep them safe.

00:47:21.201 --> 00:47:22.459
"Keep <i>her</i> safe.

00:47:23.401 --> 00:47:24.234
"Seriously."

00:47:25.221 --> 00:47:27.431
LAURA: Are you kicking us out, are we leaving?

00:47:27.431 --> 00:47:28.844
MATT: "No, but I mean,

00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:31.131
"I have things to tend to."

00:47:31.131 --> 00:47:32.481
LAURA: Oh yeah, of course you do.

00:47:34.941 --> 00:47:35.981
MATT: "Goodbye,"

00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:37.551
and he awkwardly walks over to the bar

00:47:37.551 --> 00:47:42.471
and takes that same, takes the full glass liquor bottle

00:47:42.471 --> 00:47:45.421
(clears throat) heads over to Marion's table.

00:47:45.421 --> 00:47:47.487
SAM: Mm, okay.

00:47:47.487 --> 00:47:48.981
MATT: "And should you need anything,

00:47:48.981 --> 00:47:50.131
"don't be afraid to ask."

00:47:52.431 --> 00:47:53.651
Kind of lingers in the moment.

00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:55.211
And Marion just sitting there

00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:58.051
pulling apart apiece of bread, looking up at him.

00:47:58.051 --> 00:48:02.831
"Well, it is greatly appreciated and

00:48:04.891 --> 00:48:08.108
"perhaps I have some questions for you later today."

00:48:08.108 --> 00:48:09.361
MARISHA: Oh!

00:48:09.361 --> 00:48:10.896
MATT: He goes,

00:48:10.896 --> 00:48:11.729
"Um.

00:48:13.581 --> 00:48:15.731
"Well, enjoy your meal," and he quickly shuffles away

00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:18.191
and heads up the stairs to his room.

00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:20.324
LAURA: Oh, he's going to be at the room before--

00:48:21.533 --> 00:48:23.765
MATT: And you hear him go, "What the?"

00:48:23.765 --> 00:48:25.289
(laughter)

00:48:25.289 --> 00:48:27.648
LAURA: (humming)

00:48:27.648 --> 00:48:29.951
TRAVIS: Are we resting this evening so that we can actually

00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:33.081
take a long rest before we go?

00:48:33.081 --> 00:48:34.859
LIAM: At our destination.

00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:35.692
LAURA: We--
TRAVIS: Copy that.

00:48:35.692 --> 00:48:38.691
LAURA: Yeah, we won't be able to
transport twice in one day so.

00:48:38.691 --> 00:48:39.524
TRAVIS: Right.

00:48:39.524 --> 00:48:40.991
TALIESIN: We'll be sleeping rough,

00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:43.141
but a comfy rough, at the very least.

00:48:43.141 --> 00:48:44.821
TRAVIS: We are good with sleeping rough.

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:45.654
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:47.203 --> 00:48:48.611
Going to grab the stuff from

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:54.804
from Pumat's and head out?

00:48:54.804 --> 00:48:55.761
SAM: Oh, I mean you don't--

00:48:55.761 --> 00:48:58.826
We don't have to go there on my account.

00:48:58.826 --> 00:49:01.791
TALIESIN: I wouldn't mind just, at the very least--

00:49:01.791 --> 00:49:03.301
LIAM: One more time for old's sake.

00:49:03.301 --> 00:49:05.681
TALIESIN: Informing friends, taking a look,

00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:07.891
maybe finding another diamond.

00:49:07.891 --> 00:49:09.691
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:11.944
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

00:49:11.944 --> 00:49:16.944
LAURA: All right, so we're not
coming back here then, before?

00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:18.311
TALIESIN: Not til it's over.

00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.071
LIAM: Boy, you can just feel us

00:49:20.071 --> 00:49:22.211
running toward our destiny, can't you?

00:49:23.871 --> 00:49:25.351
LAURA: Okay.

00:49:25.351 --> 00:49:27.981
SAM: Oh, I was going to stick
around here while you guys shopped.

00:49:27.981 --> 00:49:29.404
Is that all right?

00:49:29.404 --> 00:49:30.237
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:30.237 --> 00:49:32.691
TALIESIN: We'll pick up your--
SAM: Yeah.

00:49:32.691 --> 00:49:33.971
LIAM: Yeah, you spend time.

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:38.141
SAM: Yeah, I don't feel like, you know,

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.981
leaving him right now, if that's all right.

00:49:40.981 --> 00:49:41.814
LAURA: Of course.

00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:44.740
MARISHA: Jester, do you want us to
look for anything for you?

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.941
Do you want to stay?

00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:47.494
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:49:48.961 --> 00:49:51.651
MARISHA: Diamonds.
LAURA: Yeah, just, you know

00:49:51.651 --> 00:49:53.911
diamonds, if you guys want to pick up

00:49:53.911 --> 00:49:56.281
another one of those fancy cups

00:49:56.281 --> 00:49:59.104
so we can do a couple of Heroes' Feasts, depending.

00:50:00.081 --> 00:50:03.029
A jeweled chalice would be smart.

00:50:03.029 --> 00:50:05.101
TALIESIN: That would be a good idea.

00:50:05.101 --> 00:50:05.934
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.231
All right.

00:50:09.231 --> 00:50:10.081
LIAM: You good to go?

00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:12.571
Later?
SAM: No, you go--

00:50:12.571 --> 00:50:13.671
LIAM: Later, later.
SAM: Oh.

00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:17.281
Yeah, I mean, we have to, I have to talk

00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:22.264
to Yeza one more time, but yeah, I think.

00:50:23.581 --> 00:50:24.414
I don't know.

00:50:24.414 --> 00:50:26.681
It was a rough day yesterday, you know?

00:50:26.681 --> 00:50:27.921
LIAM: Yeah.

00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:29.504
LAURA: A rough, jeez.

00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:32.444
Yeah.

00:50:33.681 --> 00:50:35.051
ASHLEY: Is there anything that you would like us

00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:37.371
to pick up for Luc?

00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:40.044
SAM: Oh, well, last time we were there, I asked.

00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:44.391
He didn't really have much in the way of toys.

00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:46.171
Plus, I already have something for Luc, I made--

00:50:46.171 --> 00:50:47.545
MATT: (as Luc) "Toys?"

00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:48.886
He pops up from under the table.

00:50:48.886 --> 00:50:50.256
He's got a smudge in his nose

00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:53.115
and he's just crawling underneath.

00:50:53.115 --> 00:50:54.931
SAM: We weren't, we were--

00:50:54.931 --> 00:50:57.701
We were talking about toys, but only for your birthday,

00:50:57.701 --> 00:50:59.181
which isn't for a while,

00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:03.881
but I did get you something when I was up north,

00:51:03.881 --> 00:51:05.291
I got you, I got you this.

00:51:05.291 --> 00:51:07.561
And I'll take out this little horn,

00:51:07.561 --> 00:51:10.831
horned hat thing that I had made for him.

00:51:10.831 --> 00:51:11.994
It looks like mine.

00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:15.714
For when you get cold, it's not,

00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:19.111
or just when you want to look cool.

00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:21.374
MATT: "Yeah."

00:51:21.374 --> 00:51:23.121
SAM: Yeah, it's cool, right?

00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:25.301
MATT: "I look like my mom."

00:51:25.301 --> 00:51:27.351
He holds his little toy crossbow up.

00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:29.411
SAM: Yeah, we do look alike.

00:51:29.411 --> 00:51:30.581
We should get one for dad, too.

00:51:30.581 --> 00:51:33.032
MATT: Fires it off and you hear this, (grunt).

00:51:33.032 --> 00:51:35.511
It's this larger looking half-orc fellow

00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:37.284
who's covering one eye, is like (pained grunt).

00:51:37.284 --> 00:51:39.098
SAM: Sorry, sorry.

00:51:39.098 --> 00:51:41.021
MATT: "It's fine."
SAM: Okay.

00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:44.511
You can't shoot above the neck.

00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:46.631
You know, keep it down below the neck.

00:51:46.631 --> 00:51:48.701
LAURA: Unless you're trying to really hurt someone,

00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:50.091
you know, unless you're in danger

00:51:50.091 --> 00:51:52.847
then go straight for the eyeball.

00:51:52.847 --> 00:51:53.980
MATT: "Okay."

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.667
Yeza's like, "Ah, I mean, I can't argue."

00:52:01.431 --> 00:52:03.991
SAM: But I think they're going to go shopping anyway.

00:52:03.991 --> 00:52:05.911
So if there's anything you need.

00:52:05.911 --> 00:52:08.461
Actually, you know what? I have--

00:52:08.461 --> 00:52:09.681
Not that I want to do

00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:13.981
super dangerous chemical stuff around our son,

00:52:13.981 --> 00:52:17.131
but I do have some stuff to make an explosive device.

00:52:17.131 --> 00:52:18.121
And I was hoping that you would,

00:52:18.121 --> 00:52:20.810
might help me put it together at some point.

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:22.541
MATT: "Oh yeah."
SAM: Not now, not in this bar.

00:52:22.541 --> 00:52:25.121
Maybe we could, I don't know,

00:52:25.121 --> 00:52:25.971
do it sometime.

00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:27.951
MATT: "Yeah, we'll find a place."
SAM: Okay.

00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:30.349
MATT: "Likely not the interior of this space,

00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:31.441
"but yeah, we can try that."

00:52:31.441 --> 00:52:32.897
SAM: Okay.
MATT: "Okay."

00:52:32.897 --> 00:52:34.435
SAM: A little fun project.

00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:37.021
MATT: Looks over at Luc.

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:40.721
"Mommy and Daddy are going to work on a project.

00:52:40.721 --> 00:52:42.374
"Nothing dangerous.

00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.061
"In a little bit."

00:52:46.061 --> 00:52:47.261
LAURA: I'll keep him company.

00:52:48.506 --> 00:52:49.339
MATT: "Thank you very much."

00:52:49.339 --> 00:52:50.247
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:52:52.181 --> 00:52:55.411
MATT: All right, so who's going for what?

00:52:55.411 --> 00:52:57.321
Who's shopping or looking about?

00:52:57.321 --> 00:52:59.583
What's the plan in Zadash?

00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:01.211
LIAM: Find Pumat's.

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:02.161
LAURA: Quick trip.
MARISHA: Pumat's.

00:53:02.161 --> 00:53:04.031
Quick trip, yeah.

00:53:04.031 --> 00:53:05.834
TRAVIS: Famous last words.
SAM: Always say that.

00:53:05.834 --> 00:53:08.091
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I want a bespoke hat.

00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:08.924
Sorry.

00:53:11.266 --> 00:53:12.099
MATT: All righty.

00:53:12.099 --> 00:53:13.699
LIAM: Before we go, do you have

00:53:13.699 --> 00:53:14.731
a little bit of coin still?

00:53:14.731 --> 00:53:15.797
SAM: Oh, tons.

00:53:15.797 --> 00:53:16.731
LIAM: May I borrow some?

00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:19.104
SAM: Yes. How much do you need?

00:53:20.871 --> 00:53:22.511
LIAM: 500, if you have it.

00:53:22.511 --> 00:53:23.734
SAM: Here's a thousand.

00:53:25.081 --> 00:53:26.211
I'll give it to you in platinum

00:53:26.211 --> 00:53:28.791
so it's easier to carry.

00:53:28.791 --> 00:53:29.854
LIAM: Thank you.

00:53:29.854 --> 00:53:31.631
MATT: Yeza at the table is watching you

00:53:31.631 --> 00:53:33.681
give him this like

00:53:33.681 --> 00:53:37.064
"You are really

00:53:37.064 --> 00:53:39.564
"making some money as adventurers, aren't you?"

00:53:39.564 --> 00:53:40.741
LIAM: Shrewd businesswoman.

00:53:41.803 --> 00:53:43.661
MATT: "No joke."
TALIESIN: High risk, high reward.

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:46.531
SAM: Well, also we don't spend that much

00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:49.941
because Caleb here gives us free lodging when we need it.

00:53:49.941 --> 00:53:53.911
And you know, bolts don't cost that much.

00:53:53.911 --> 00:53:56.551
Caduceus can make us food when we need it.

00:53:56.551 --> 00:53:57.384
TALIESIN: It's pretty good.

00:53:57.384 --> 00:53:59.601
LIAM: Those frequent tower points add up.

00:54:00.963 --> 00:54:02.546
MATT: "All right."

00:54:02.546 --> 00:54:04.203
TRAVIS: Shame on you.

00:54:04.203 --> 00:54:05.681
(laughter)

00:54:05.681 --> 00:54:09.061
MATT: "If you are going into town, just because probably

00:54:10.731 --> 00:54:13.961
"shopping in the market's not the safest thing, just--"

00:54:13.961 --> 00:54:16.481
and he starts writing down on a piece of paper--

00:54:16.481 --> 00:54:17.941
SAM: Cereal, eggs.
MATT: Yeah.

00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:22.421
General food and survival items

00:54:22.421 --> 00:54:24.589
while they're going to be down in this safe area.
SAM: Change of pants.

00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:27.402
LAURA: Maybe disguise yourselves before you go?

00:54:30.191 --> 00:54:31.264
Just in casies.

00:54:33.448 --> 00:54:36.051
Do you guys have a spell to do that?

00:54:36.051 --> 00:54:36.884
TALIESIN: I can do that.

00:54:36.884 --> 00:54:38.221
LIAM: For me.

00:54:38.221 --> 00:54:39.054
You can.

00:54:41.742 --> 00:54:43.401
SAM: Yashie?

00:54:43.401 --> 00:54:46.611
ASHLEY: I mean, I can't disguise myself

00:54:46.611 --> 00:54:51.551
but I'm up for, you know, being--

00:54:51.551 --> 00:54:53.851
if you want to make me into something.

00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:56.274
LAURA: Can I-- hmm, let me see.

00:54:57.241 --> 00:54:58.711
SAM: Who would we be hiding from?

00:54:58.711 --> 00:55:01.111
Just the prying eyes of--?

00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:02.451
LAURA: Any, yeah.

00:55:02.451 --> 00:55:04.211
ASHLEY: It's not a bad idea.

00:55:04.211 --> 00:55:05.044
SAM: We're scry-proof right?

00:55:05.044 --> 00:55:06.761
LIAM: It's not concentration, so I can--

00:55:06.761 --> 00:55:08.581
TALIESIN: Doesn't mean they don't
have agents walking around.

00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:09.414
LAURA: Oh, you can?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:55:09.414 --> 00:55:10.311
LAURA: Okay.

00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:12.331
LIAM: Easy, for you both, for the three of us.

00:55:12.331 --> 00:55:15.131
SAM: Oh great, cool.
LIAM: I was not thinking.

00:55:15.131 --> 00:55:16.783
LAURA: Great.
ASHLEY: Great.

00:55:16.783 --> 00:55:19.324
MARISHA: Make me look like--

00:55:19.324 --> 00:55:20.461
LIAM: One of the Spice Girls?

00:55:20.461 --> 00:55:21.914
MARISHA: Yes, nailed it.

00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:24.534
Sporty, if you don't mind.

00:55:24.534 --> 00:55:25.367
ASHLEY: Damn.

00:55:27.341 --> 00:55:30.021
Could I be a Spice Girl as well?

00:55:30.021 --> 00:55:31.411
LIAM: Yeah, which you--

00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:32.661
ASHLEY: Surprise me.

00:55:32.661 --> 00:55:35.286
LIAM: Okay. She's Posh.

00:55:35.286 --> 00:55:37.551
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:55:37.551 --> 00:55:38.911
It kind of works.

00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:40.701
LIAM: Scary Spice is obvious.

00:55:40.701 --> 00:55:42.091
MARISHA: It's the little--
LIAM: Obvious choice.

00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:43.961
MARISHA: Little black dress.

00:55:43.961 --> 00:55:45.581
MATT: The classic historical adventuring team

00:55:45.581 --> 00:55:47.391
out of Marquet, the Spice Girls?

00:55:47.391 --> 00:55:48.791
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn into Alan Cummings

00:55:48.791 --> 00:55:49.997
as the manager from the film.

00:55:49.997 --> 00:55:52.692
MATT: There you go.
LAURA: Oh my god, yes!

00:55:52.692 --> 00:55:54.033
TRAVIS: From the film.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:55:54.033 --> 00:55:55.299
MATT: Oh my god.

00:55:55.299 --> 00:55:56.132
TALIESIN: Spice World.

00:55:56.132 --> 00:55:57.963
LIAM: I make myself look like Baby Spice.

00:55:58.911 --> 00:56:03.001
TRAVIS: Well, I suppose I'll be a Spice Girl as well.

00:56:03.001 --> 00:56:04.331
LIAM: You're Scary.

00:56:04.331 --> 00:56:05.836
LAURA: No, he's Ginger.

00:56:05.836 --> 00:56:07.461
LIAM: Oh yeah, I forgot.

00:56:07.461 --> 00:56:09.251
ASHLEY: We are here to spice up your life.

00:56:09.251 --> 00:56:10.441
LIAM: Yeah, to match your ring.

00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:12.088
TALIESIN: You spice?
ASHLEY: You spice?

00:56:12.088 --> 00:56:14.511
LAURA: Here, before you go. I give Ginger Spice

00:56:15.871 --> 00:56:18.251
all my money just to help out with--

00:56:18.251 --> 00:56:20.631
it's only 393 gold.

00:56:20.631 --> 00:56:21.651
TRAVIS: That's all your money?

00:56:21.651 --> 00:56:24.531
LAURA: I've spent a lot on diamonds, Fjord!

00:56:24.531 --> 00:56:28.531
Here, that's for more diamonds or whatever else

00:56:28.531 --> 00:56:30.291
you find that could be useful for us, okay?

00:56:30.291 --> 00:56:32.034
SAM: Jester, do you need money?

00:56:32.034 --> 00:56:33.171
LAURA: What do I need money for?

00:56:33.171 --> 00:56:34.004
SAM: I don't know.

00:56:34.004 --> 00:56:35.751
LAURA: We're going up into the North to die,

00:56:35.751 --> 00:56:37.311
so I won't need it after.

00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:38.361
SAM: That's fair, that's fair.
TALIESIN: Mittens.

00:56:38.361 --> 00:56:39.962
Mittens it is, all right.

00:56:39.962 --> 00:56:41.328
Maybe some mukluks.

00:56:41.328 --> 00:56:42.761
MARISHA: Don't want cold hands while you're dying.

00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:43.594
TALIESIN: No.

00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:46.444
MARISHA: All right.

00:56:48.391 --> 00:56:49.521
To the spice bus?

00:56:49.521 --> 00:56:51.514
ASHLEY: To the spice bus.
LIAM: Spice Girls world tour! Here we go!

00:56:51.514 --> 00:56:53.542
SAM: They had a spice bus?

00:56:53.542 --> 00:56:56.258
MARISHA: Absolutely they did, it was the fucking coolest.

00:56:56.258 --> 00:56:57.631
TALIESIN: How have you not seen this movie?

00:56:57.631 --> 00:56:58.731
SAM: I haven't seen the movie.

00:56:58.731 --> 00:57:00.482
LIAM: Oh wow, you would love it.
MARISHA: They each had their own little area in it.

00:57:00.482 --> 00:57:01.390
TRAVIS: No, they didn't.

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:02.761
LAURA: Yes.
MARISHA: It was the coolest.

00:57:02.761 --> 00:57:03.694
LIAM: It's a good movie.

00:57:03.694 --> 00:57:06.081
TRAVIS: In the movie or in real--?
LIAM: It's silly fun.

00:57:06.081 --> 00:57:08.033
TALIESIN: Do it with a Josie
and the Pussycats double feature.

00:57:08.033 --> 00:57:09.331
MARISHA: In the movie, they did a

00:57:09.331 --> 00:57:11.424
"it was bigger on the inside" TARDIS thing,

00:57:11.424 --> 00:57:13.080
but they did have a spice bus.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.180
TRAVIS: All right.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.386
TALIESIN: The more you know.
MARISHA: Anyway.

00:57:15.386 --> 00:57:17.842
MATT: So in Zadash, where're you going?

00:57:17.842 --> 00:57:20.086
TRAVIS: Quick trip, "quick trip."

00:57:21.111 --> 00:57:22.963
On the spice bus.
ASHLEY: The bus will get us there quick.

00:57:22.963 --> 00:57:24.121
LIAM: Pumat's.
LAURA: Mr. Pumat's.

00:57:24.121 --> 00:57:25.071
I'm not there.

00:57:25.071 --> 00:57:26.801
MATT: No, fair enough.
LAURA: But I'm thinking Pumat's.

00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:29.211
MATT: All right, so you make your way to the Pentamarket.

00:57:29.211 --> 00:57:31.151
The wind is picking up, a little chillier.

00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:32.991
The clouds are coming in a little bit

00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:34.416
so there's a little bit of a grayer sky

00:57:34.416 --> 00:57:36.481
coming for the latter half of the afternoon.

00:57:37.711 --> 00:57:38.981
Weaving your way through the streets, you eventually

00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:41.521
find your way to the familiar green wooden exterior

00:57:41.521 --> 00:57:42.984
of the Invulnerable Vagrant.

00:57:43.911 --> 00:57:46.321
Walking inside, you see one hooded figure

00:57:46.321 --> 00:57:47.481
is currently walking around

00:57:47.481 --> 00:57:50.481
and just checking out odds and ends.

00:57:50.481 --> 00:57:52.501
Couple of small books, some materials.

00:57:52.501 --> 00:57:55.101
And in the back, you can see the familiar face

00:57:55.101 --> 00:57:58.001
of Pumat behind, looking over towards

00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:00.281
the potential customer who is currently looking around

00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:02.984
and looks over to you as you enter the main entryway.

00:58:03.961 --> 00:58:05.474
"Oh, oh, goodness me.

00:58:05.474 --> 00:58:07.411
"This is a fine how do you do.

00:58:07.411 --> 00:58:10.134
"How are you all doing? Welcome back."

00:58:11.153 --> 00:58:11.986
LIAM: Oh, hello.

00:58:11.986 --> 00:58:14.521
We are not a group of adorable singers.

00:58:14.521 --> 00:58:16.763
MARISHA: Yeah, does he see through it?

00:58:16.763 --> 00:58:18.987
LAURA: Does he have truesight?
MARISHA: Does he know?

00:58:18.987 --> 00:58:20.237
LAURA: (gasps)

00:58:21.891 --> 00:58:23.441
Oh my god, that's awesome.

00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:26.711
LIAM: But I'm also Baby Spice in here, so.

00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:28.671
MARISHA: It's true.

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:30.781
LIAM: So hello. We're back, we're passing through town.

00:58:30.781 --> 00:58:32.391
How have you been?

00:58:32.391 --> 00:58:33.407
MATT: "My apologies,

00:58:33.407 --> 00:58:36.791
"I should have expected this was intentional.

00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:40.584
"Well, it's a pleasure to meet all of you strange--"

00:58:42.801 --> 00:58:44.971
MARISHA: Girls.
MATT: "Girls.

00:58:44.971 --> 00:58:49.191
"Adventuring ladies in here. Hi, I'm Pumat Sol,

00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:52.199
"happy to help you in whatever

00:58:52.199 --> 00:58:54.761
"it is you might be looking for."

00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:56.181
TRAVIS: Are there other people in the shop?

00:58:56.181 --> 00:58:57.039
MATT: There's one other individual.

00:58:57.039 --> 00:58:57.872
LIAM: Oh, good.

00:58:57.872 --> 00:58:59.909
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out. No, I'm just kidding.

00:58:59.909 --> 00:59:02.986
(laughs) Shop's closed.

00:59:02.986 --> 00:59:04.761
TALIESIN: Reel it in, Ginger. Reel it in.

00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:08.347
LIAM: Caleb's scratchy Zemnian

00:59:08.347 --> 00:59:11.572
coming out of Baby Spice's mouth.

00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:13.731
MATT: Yeah, so the figure in the hood

00:59:13.731 --> 00:59:16.788
is looking curiously over

00:59:16.788 --> 00:59:18.616
the shoulder before going back

00:59:18.616 --> 00:59:22.171
to looking at small little

00:59:22.171 --> 00:59:26.764
wands and orbs and random magical knick-knacks.

00:59:29.341 --> 00:59:32.381
"So you're welcome to look about the place.

00:59:32.381 --> 00:59:36.898
"Still kind of sparse, but you're welcome to it."

00:59:36.898 --> 00:59:38.471
MARISHA: We just need a few things.

00:59:38.471 --> 00:59:41.154
One, we need to pick up that flask that

00:59:43.241 --> 00:59:44.311
Lady Veth left behind.

00:59:44.311 --> 00:59:47.991
MATT: "Right, yes, the flask that was ordered, not by you

00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:50.931
"but from another person, since we first met right now."

00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:53.141
LIAM: Yes, this was Scary Spice.

00:59:53.141 --> 00:59:55.573
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: "Ah, oh, don't want to

00:59:55.573 --> 00:59:58.078
"figure out how you got that nickname.

00:59:58.078 --> 01:00:01.601
"Uh-huh. Let me get that for you."

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:03.391
He's just terrible at lying.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.381
He's so bad at it.

01:00:05.381 --> 01:00:07.745
I mean, one's off to the back and you hear

01:00:07.745 --> 01:00:09.574
a couple of footsteps coming down the way

01:00:09.574 --> 01:00:13.254
and be like, "Oh, hi!

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:16.031
"Bunch of new customers today.

01:00:16.031 --> 01:00:17.541
"It's a happening place here."

01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.351
And the other Pumat comes out of his curtain

01:00:19.351 --> 01:00:21.084
goes like, "No, shh, shh."

01:00:22.081 --> 01:00:24.001
"Oh, apologies."

01:00:24.001 --> 01:00:25.651
And just goes right back upstairs

01:00:26.836 --> 01:00:28.831
The original Pumat Prime comes back out again.

01:00:28.831 --> 01:00:31.711
He goes, "Here you go.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.391
"Here's your requested--"

01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:36.435
SAM: I'm not there, but he'll pick it up.

01:00:36.435 --> 01:00:37.268
LIAM: I will take it--

01:00:37.268 --> 01:00:38.518
SAM: It's very confusing because I'm dressed

01:00:38.518 --> 01:00:39.951
as Not Here Spice.

01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:41.661
MATT: Right, sorry.

01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:44.162
TALIESIN: Spice not appearing in this quest.

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:46.927
ASHLEY: We'll make sure to

01:00:47.919 --> 01:00:49.802
(British accent) give this to her.

01:00:49.802 --> 01:00:51.311
(normal voice) That's right.

01:00:51.311 --> 01:00:52.671
We'll make sure to give this to her.

01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:54.804
I was trying something and it didn't work.

01:00:57.531 --> 01:00:59.314
TALIESIN: (over-enunciating) We're also in the market

01:00:59.314 --> 01:01:03.911
for gems, if you've got any?

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:04.744
TRAVIS: Are you--

01:01:05.664 --> 01:01:07.797
TALIESIN: I'm trying to do a-- I'm trying to do your role.

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.741
TRAVIS: (high-pitched grunting)

01:01:09.741 --> 01:01:10.830
TALIESIN: Yeah?

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:13.224
MARISHA: This is so awkward.

01:01:13.224 --> 01:01:14.891
The most awkward we've ever been!

01:01:14.891 --> 01:01:16.631
LIAM: Pumat, I was hoping to rifle through

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:18.951
any scrolls you have in the shop.

01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:21.551
I know that you are low on everything, but.

01:01:21.551 --> 01:01:24.621
MATT: "Well, I can probably muster a few.

01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:25.681
"Anything in particular you're looking for?

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:27.621
"We've got a bunch of things in the back.

01:01:27.621 --> 01:01:30.941
"So I guess, give me something to focus on."

01:01:30.941 --> 01:01:31.884
LIAM: Higher level?

01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:35.934
MATT: "Define higher level."

01:01:39.901 --> 01:01:40.851
LIAM: Five, six, seven?

01:01:44.161 --> 01:01:47.191
TALIESIN: And diamonds, definitely diamonds. Die-muns.

01:01:47.191 --> 01:01:48.681
Dah-monds?

01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:51.821
MATT: "I'm not much of a purveyor of cut gems,

01:01:51.821 --> 01:01:53.491
"it's not really my specialty.

01:01:53.491 --> 01:01:56.171
"I can imbue them with a magical properties

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.381
"over an extended period of time,

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:59.591
"but I'm not a jeweler."

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:00.424
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:02:00.424 --> 01:02:03.130
MATT: "Sorry, Manny Spice."
ASHLEY: Do you have

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:07.771
a jeweled chalice then, or no, that's still--?

01:02:07.771 --> 01:02:10.221
MATT: "No, you got to commission those from the--

01:02:11.354 --> 01:02:12.819
"well, there's a number of folks here in Zadash

01:02:12.819 --> 01:02:15.367
"that could probably do it. I can point you to a couple.

01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:20.007
"To answer your question, looking for--

01:02:20.007 --> 01:02:22.521
"we're a little limited in the upper register.

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:24.364
"Cause a lot of that

01:02:24.364 --> 01:02:28.119
"magic is kind of regulated."

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:29.451
LIAM: <i>Ja, ja</i>.

01:02:29.451 --> 01:02:31.609
MATT: "(stilted) And it would be illegal

01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:34.261
"to sell such magical things

01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:36.527
"to random strangers on the street."

01:02:36.527 --> 01:02:37.835
TRAVIS: (high-pitched grunt)

01:02:39.371 --> 01:02:41.121
MARISHA: Is that guy looking at us?

01:02:41.121 --> 01:02:44.981
MATT: No, but he's keeping in place, listening a little bit.

01:02:44.981 --> 01:02:49.114
TALIESIN: Insight-- I was planning
on insight checking this person.

01:02:51.169 --> 01:02:52.449
TRAVIS: Eadwulf.

01:02:52.449 --> 01:02:54.472
TALIESIN: 17.
MATT: 17?

01:02:54.472 --> 01:02:55.656
LAURA: That's not terrible.

01:02:55.656 --> 01:02:56.551
TALIESIN: For me, it's terrible.

01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:58.601
MATT: They were looking through
things and, since you've entered,

01:02:58.601 --> 01:03:00.141
they've done the thing where

01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:03.431
they just seem to keep going back to the same objects.

01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:06.361
And so you get the sense that they're just eavesdropping.

01:03:06.361 --> 01:03:07.402
MARISHA: Just nosy?

01:03:11.301 --> 01:03:13.221
MATT: (as Pumat) "But maybe-- I'll see what I can have

01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:17.446
"that's more on a viable public

01:03:17.446 --> 01:03:20.995
"purchasing level."

01:03:20.995 --> 01:03:22.589
LIAM: Absolutely.

01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:23.981
MATT: And he steps into the back a bit

01:03:23.981 --> 01:03:27.675
and comes back with a few small cases

01:03:27.675 --> 01:03:29.091
and sets them out.

01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:31.721
"These are your fundamental and low level

01:03:31.721 --> 01:03:33.066
"easy to pick up magics

01:03:33.066 --> 01:03:36.571
"that can be helpful for the starting mage."

01:03:36.571 --> 01:03:38.881
LIAM: I like to go back to the basics.

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:39.872
MATT: "Fair enough."

01:03:40.941 --> 01:03:43.254
Kind of glancing in you see,

01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:47.203
one of them, hold on.

01:03:47.203 --> 01:03:48.861
TRAVIS: (high-pitched grunt)
MARISHA: (snorts)

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:52.401
Ginger is having a rough day.

01:03:52.401 --> 01:03:53.444
MATT: Yeah, apparently.

01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:56.671
TRAVIS: (high-pitched growl)

01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:59.880
MARISHA: Ginger's a Muppet now, being played by Ms. Piggy.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.840
TRAVIS: (Ms. Piggy noises)
(laughter)

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.176
SAM: (like Ms. Piggy) Kermie.

01:04:04.176 --> 01:04:05.510
TRAVIS: (like Ms. Piggy) Oh Kermie.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:07.931
MARISHA: That was a pretty good Ms. Piggy.

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:10.064
MATT: One of them is Wall of Ice.

01:04:14.301 --> 01:04:16.081
Second one is

01:04:19.611 --> 01:04:21.254
Cloudkill.

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:24.069
TRAVIS: The fuck?
LAURA: Sounds cool.

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:25.571
ASHLEY: <i>Was ist das?</i>

01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:27.861
TRAVIS: Kill a cloud, it's not that cool.

01:04:27.861 --> 01:04:29.164
1st-level (poof).

01:04:30.608 --> 01:04:32.861
MATT: And the--
TRAVIS: Sun!

01:04:32.861 --> 01:04:36.531
MATT: The third and final one is called Arcane Sword.

01:04:36.531 --> 01:04:38.339
LIAM: Arcane Sword?
MATT: Yeah.

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:43.534
LIAM: So Cloudkill, Arcane Sword, okay.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.231
Oh boy.

01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:48.761
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab Beau and move to the side

01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:51.024
of the the shop to show something off.

01:04:53.111 --> 01:04:53.944
MARISHA: Yes?

01:04:55.341 --> 01:04:58.799
TALIESIN: I should make an offhand comment to

01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:00.739
throw Mr. Nosy in the wrong direction

01:05:00.739 --> 01:05:02.535
of where we're going.

01:05:02.535 --> 01:05:04.184
MARISHA: (affirmative grunts)

01:05:04.184 --> 01:05:07.491
LIAM: I'm perusing, perusing.

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:15.124
MARISHA: You know your accent reminds me,

01:05:16.941 --> 01:05:19.544
where's your accent from what are you trying to do?

01:05:20.841 --> 01:05:23.644
It's like you, but just more stupid.

01:05:24.777 --> 01:05:28.143
TALIESIN: I was trying to do the--

01:05:28.143 --> 01:05:31.293
Fjord's old how-- (stammering) howdy.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.244
(bad Southern accent) I don't know where it's from.

01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:38.574
Wasn't doing it very long.

01:05:41.601 --> 01:05:43.481
ASHLEY: It sounds like you have something in your mouth.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.314
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:05:44.314 --> 01:05:46.119
TALIESIN: (normal voice) Feels that, feels that way.

01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:47.260
ASHLEY: Like a--

01:05:48.261 --> 01:05:49.786
TALIESIN: A big wad of gum.

01:05:49.786 --> 01:05:51.274
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:05:52.261 --> 01:05:54.648
MARISHA: I don't even know how to work with this, Caduceus.

01:05:54.648 --> 01:05:56.521
TALIESIN: I'm dropping it once we're out of here,

01:05:56.521 --> 01:05:57.831
I just feel like if I stop

01:05:57.831 --> 01:06:00.012
it'll be more suspicious.
MATT: He's already committed.

01:06:01.937 --> 01:06:03.131
All right.

01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:06.664
ASHLEY: Do you, Pumat, have things here, like, you know,

01:06:07.701 --> 01:06:10.131
clothing or cereal

01:06:11.221 --> 01:06:13.141
or supplies for living?

01:06:13.141 --> 01:06:14.764
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Milk, do you have milk?

01:06:15.922 --> 01:06:20.922
ASHLEY: Milk, you know just some, some goods.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:24.641
MARISHA: And diamonds and a jewel-encrusted
chalice, the basics.

01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:28.421
MATT: "I, uh-- well, I apologize, but I am not much

01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:31.019
"of a purveyor of gems and or chalices,

01:06:31.019 --> 01:06:32.901
"as I stated previously,

01:06:32.901 --> 01:06:37.901
"nor a keeper of oats or breakfast items.

01:06:38.031 --> 01:06:39.544
"I am an enchanter."

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.605
ASHLEY: Do you have enchanted oats?

01:06:43.605 --> 01:06:46.048
MATT: "Is that a thing?"

01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:48.431
He scribbles a little note to himself.

01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:50.281
"I'll get to that later.

01:06:50.281 --> 01:06:51.501
"But there are a number of places

01:06:51.501 --> 01:06:53.091
"throughout the entire city where you can go ahead

01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:55.631
"and find these things for a nice cheap price.

01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:57.811
"And if anyone gives you any trouble, just tell them

01:06:57.811 --> 01:06:59.144
"that Pumat sent you."

01:06:59.144 --> 01:06:59.977
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:06:59.977 --> 01:07:01.655
MATT: Don't know if it'll help, but you know."

01:07:01.655 --> 01:07:03.373
ASHLEY: It could.
MATT: "It'll sound officious."

01:07:03.373 --> 01:07:04.206
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:07:06.111 --> 01:07:09.501
MATT: "So any interest in these extremely low level

01:07:09.501 --> 01:07:12.731
"and paltry magical spell scrolls?"

01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:15.481
LIAM: Yeah, I will take this jumping one right here

01:07:15.481 --> 01:07:18.314
and I'll tap on the Cloudkill spell.

01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.501
MATT: "All righty, that'll only be a little price."

01:07:22.501 --> 01:07:24.281
And he writes a little note and passes it over.

01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:26.189
It says 6,000 gold pieces.

01:07:26.189 --> 01:07:27.674
LIAM: (pained sound)

01:07:27.674 --> 01:07:29.507
LAURA: Whoa.
LIAM: Wow.

01:07:30.351 --> 01:07:31.434
Wow!

01:07:31.434 --> 01:07:32.384
MARISHA: Still pricey.

01:07:35.966 --> 01:07:39.894
LIAM: You know, maybe I will stick to the regular jumping

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:42.754
just with my legs.

01:07:44.781 --> 01:07:47.321
But I will consider this.

01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:50.904
And the next time we are coming through town again.

01:07:50.904 --> 01:07:54.095
(whispers) I don't think we're
ever coming through town again,

01:07:54.095 --> 01:07:55.021
I will pick it up then.

01:07:55.021 --> 01:07:57.491
Apologies for making you go to the trouble

01:07:57.491 --> 01:07:59.654
to find this jumping spell.

01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:01.644
MATT: "No worries.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:04.284
"But if ever you need it, you know where to find it."

01:08:04.284 --> 01:08:06.071
He goes and takes it, puts it away.

01:08:06.071 --> 01:08:07.334
ASHLEY: Wait, do you appraise things

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.831
and look at them and do that whole thing?

01:08:09.831 --> 01:08:12.511
MATT: "I can, depending on the object."

01:08:12.511 --> 01:08:13.772
ASHLEY: Because I've--

01:08:15.761 --> 01:08:18.051
I've been wanting someone to look at this

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.098
and tell me a little bit.

01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:23.761
I'm going to pull out my

01:08:25.879 --> 01:08:27.991
Tuskborn press plate--

01:08:27.991 --> 01:08:30.921
breastplate, I'm not sure why I said press plate.

01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:34.351
My armor from Obann.

01:08:34.351 --> 01:08:35.571
MATT: Right, right.

01:08:37.961 --> 01:08:40.894
ASHLEY: I've just always was curious about this.

01:08:42.716 --> 01:08:45.604
Is it magical at all or it's just--?

01:08:48.671 --> 01:08:51.421
How much do you think something like that would go for?

01:08:53.051 --> 01:08:55.454
MATT: Well, real fast.

01:08:58.421 --> 01:09:00.281
Have you been wearing this?

01:09:00.281 --> 01:09:01.321
ASHLEY: No.

01:09:01.321 --> 01:09:02.571
MATT: Where has it been kept?

01:09:03.491 --> 01:09:05.251
ASHLEY: In my bag.

01:09:05.251 --> 01:09:06.701
MATT: Okay, so you just have this breastplate in the bag?

01:09:06.701 --> 01:09:07.534
Okay, got it.

01:09:07.534 --> 01:09:09.480
I'll allow it, I'll allow it.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.241
(laughter)

01:09:11.241 --> 01:09:12.724
ASHLEY: I mean, if that feels,

01:09:14.324 --> 01:09:16.817
I mean, I don't know why I would carry that big

01:09:16.817 --> 01:09:18.791
in my pack bag.

01:09:18.791 --> 01:09:20.711
MARISHA: Just for a change of breastplate.

01:09:20.711 --> 01:09:22.691
ASHLEY: Yeah. I mean--

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:24.831
MATT: I'll allow it, I'll allow it. It's fine.

01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:27.648
"Why, let me go ahead and take a second, let me--"

01:09:27.648 --> 01:09:28.741
and he pulls his goggles down

01:09:28.741 --> 01:09:30.351
and adjusts one of the lenses on it

01:09:30.351 --> 01:09:32.351
and takes a look and goes,

01:09:32.351 --> 01:09:33.961
"Well, it's certainly got some,

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.904
"some magical enchantment here.

01:09:40.621 --> 01:09:44.414
"Oh yeah, this is, uh--" he pulls the goggles up.

01:09:45.851 --> 01:09:48.401
"This is of an infernal make.

01:09:48.401 --> 01:09:49.234
"Most definitely.

01:09:50.381 --> 01:09:54.444
"Got some bad energy."

01:09:57.771 --> 01:09:58.681
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:09:58.681 --> 01:10:02.784
Do you-- what does something like this cost?

01:10:05.191 --> 01:10:06.381
MATT: "Well, something like this you'd

01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:08.891
"either have to get from somebody's odd collection

01:10:08.891 --> 01:10:12.521
"or probably through some nefarious means.

01:10:12.521 --> 01:10:13.734
"How'd you get it?"

01:10:16.141 --> 01:10:20.951
ASHLEY: Somebody gave it to me as a gift.

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.451
A lovely gift.

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:23.913
MATT: "Well, whoever it is,

01:10:23.913 --> 01:10:25.311
"you might want to question where they got it.

01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:28.704
"This thing's got a-- got a dark legacy behind it."

01:10:30.391 --> 01:10:33.981
ASHLEY: Yeah, I figured as much,

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:35.711
but I just wanted to--

01:10:35.711 --> 01:10:37.149
TRAVIS: We should get the fuck out of here.

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:38.274
ASHLEY: --check in.

01:10:39.631 --> 01:10:41.191
MATT: "If you're looking to get rid of it,

01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:43.411
"I could probably take it off your hands.

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:45.421
"I mean, I can think of a handful of folks

01:10:45.421 --> 01:10:47.321
"that would want to probably add it to their collection,

01:10:47.321 --> 01:10:48.721
"if you want to part with it."

01:10:52.631 --> 01:10:54.521
ASHLEY: I'll give it some time.

01:10:54.521 --> 01:10:58.964
We'll be back for the scroll later.

01:10:59.831 --> 01:11:03.544
MARISHA: Maybe we can find someone to sell it to in Darktow.

01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:05.781
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea.

01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:06.614
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:10.103
Since we're headed that direction.

01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:12.186
TRAVIS: To Darktow.
MATT: "Wait, you're heading to Darktow?"

01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:15.731
MARISHA: Yeah, just don't tell anybody.

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:18.181
MATT: Leans over towards the guy in the hood who, like,

01:11:20.051 --> 01:11:22.564
puts something away in a satchel and starts walking out.

01:11:25.691 --> 01:11:27.531
"I'd just be careful.

01:11:27.531 --> 01:11:30.971
"That's a-- that's a place of bad folk."

01:11:30.971 --> 01:11:33.341
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, so we've heard.

01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:39.265
Well, wish us luck, Pumat.

01:11:39.265 --> 01:11:41.951
Anybody need anything else before we

01:11:41.951 --> 01:11:44.501
get the rest of our groceries?

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:47.251
LIAM: No, it's been a pleasure doing

01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:49.481
business with you over the months.

01:11:49.481 --> 01:11:51.691
We hope to see you again.

01:11:51.691 --> 01:11:52.646
MATT: "Of course."
LIAM: Soon.

01:11:52.646 --> 01:11:53.681
MATT: "You know where to find me.

01:11:53.681 --> 01:11:55.521
"Just come on by whenever.

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:57.931
"Hopefully, in a few more months here
we'll have a better stock.

01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:01.774
"It's got cleaned out recently, but check in."

01:12:01.774 --> 01:12:04.601
TALIESIN: Is this a new cleaned out
or the same old cleaned out?

01:12:04.601 --> 01:12:06.091
MATT: "Mostly same old cleaned out.

01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:06.924
"You know when

01:12:08.141 --> 01:12:10.911
"most of this was confiscated by the Assembly,

01:12:10.911 --> 01:12:12.941
"just went disappearing past enemy lines.

01:12:12.941 --> 01:12:14.141
"And I've been trying to

01:12:15.611 --> 01:12:18.151
"rebuild some sort of a rapport here

01:12:18.151 --> 01:12:20.450
"with new objects and items, but that takes time."

01:12:21.525 --> 01:12:22.891
TALIESIN: Makes sense, makes sense.

01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:26.191
MATT: "Yeah, Zadash wasn't built in a day."

01:12:26.191 --> 01:12:27.824
TALIESIN: (sighs)

01:12:27.824 --> 01:12:30.129
LIAM: Well, I'm sure we will be back before too long.

01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:33.372
MATT: "Well, I look forward to it.

01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:38.391
"You still doing this illusion thing next time?

01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:40.041
"Kind of hard to concentrate and try

01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:42.786
"to focus on which one's which."

01:12:42.786 --> 01:12:44.392
TALIESIN: Hopefully not.

01:12:45.391 --> 01:12:46.851
MARISHA: Only if you would like us to come back

01:12:46.851 --> 01:12:48.464
and spice up your life.

01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:51.181
MATT: "I'll think on it."

01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:53.349
MARISHA: Okay, next tour then.

01:12:54.891 --> 01:12:56.464
TALIESIN: Spice life.

01:12:56.464 --> 01:12:58.849
(laughter)

01:12:58.849 --> 01:13:00.491
MATT: "All righty."

01:13:00.491 --> 01:13:02.028
TRAVIS: Please, god.

01:13:02.028 --> 01:13:04.361
(laughter)

01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:08.189
MATT: All right.

01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:10.431
LIAM: Anybody else have anywhere else to go? I don't.

01:13:10.431 --> 01:13:11.922
TALIESIN: Chalice and diamonds, if they exist,

01:13:11.922 --> 01:13:14.666
but other than that, we can just roll.

01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:16.651
MATT: Whoever wants to helm that,
make an investigation check.

01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:17.551
TALIESIN: Not me.

01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:19.194
MARISHA: I'll try it.
MATT: Okay.

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:20.301
LIAM: I will assist.

01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:22.271
MARISHA: Ooh, okay.

01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:24.292
LIAM: Look, over there.

01:13:24.292 --> 01:13:27.799
MARISHA: That's both pretty good, both pretty good.

01:13:27.799 --> 01:13:28.811
(laughter)

01:13:28.811 --> 01:13:29.916
TALIESIN: Ye Olde Pier One.

01:13:29.916 --> 01:13:31.031
MARISHA: 30 total.

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.374
SAM: Whoa!
ASHLEY: Damn.

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:34.175
LIAM: (air horn)

01:13:34.175 --> 01:13:35.874
MATT: (clears throat)

01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:40.874
So jeweled chalices, on the scale of cost

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:42.581
that you would need and what you're looking for

01:13:42.581 --> 01:13:44.331
are very, very hard to find

01:13:44.331 --> 01:13:46.671
because they're usually made to order.

01:13:46.671 --> 01:13:48.551
It's not like somebody just sits there often

01:13:48.551 --> 01:13:52.615
with a massive gold chalice or jeweled chalice

01:13:52.615 --> 01:13:54.281
ready to go ahead and sell off to anybody

01:13:54.281 --> 01:13:56.391
and it just stays in their window.

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:58.041
That would be an invitation.

01:13:58.041 --> 01:14:00.891
SAM: There isn't a Faberge egg store around

01:14:00.891 --> 01:14:01.921
that just happens to have--
(laughter)

01:14:01.921 --> 01:14:03.724
MATT: You find something akin to it.

01:14:04.981 --> 01:14:06.114
There is one.

01:14:07.751 --> 01:14:11.281
One that is available, but only after asking around,

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:13.071
getting a bit of a feel for where such a place

01:14:13.071 --> 01:14:15.114
would be able to be located.

01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:18.691
Let me find the proper...

01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:23.344
There it is.

01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:26.761
So it's worth 1,000 gold pieces.

01:14:26.761 --> 01:14:30.249
You do find it. It is a little bit upcharged

01:14:30.249 --> 01:14:33.454
to 1,100, but it is ready and available.

01:14:34.491 --> 01:14:36.501
MARISHA: Do they have any diamonds?

01:14:36.501 --> 01:14:39.141
MATT: This individual does not have any major diamonds.

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.031
They have really, really small ones,

01:14:41.031 --> 01:14:44.056
like Swarovski crystal style.
MARISHA: Oh.

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:46.491
MATT: And that's going to be the challenge here, too,

01:14:46.491 --> 01:14:51.491
is diamonds aren't available on a mass scale.

01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:54.021
There isn't De Beers blood diamond trade

01:14:54.021 --> 01:14:56.191
here in the empire, necessarily.

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:57.771
And most ones you find will be smaller

01:14:57.771 --> 01:15:01.364
and you'll have to consolidate them over time.

01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:03.461
TALIESIN: We'll probably take what they've got

01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:05.991
because we always need powdered diamond anyway, so.

01:15:05.991 --> 01:15:08.658
MARISHA: Can I ask if he'll throw in some of these diamonds

01:15:08.658 --> 01:15:10.901
and then we'll call it 1,100?

01:15:10.901 --> 01:15:11.867
MATT: Throw in, no.

01:15:11.867 --> 01:15:14.311
LAURA: (laughs) Throw in some diamonds.

01:15:14.311 --> 01:15:17.351
MATT: But you can make a perception check

01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:19.931
to try and haggle a bit, if you'd like.

01:15:19.931 --> 01:15:21.598
MARISHA: Persuasion?
MATT: Sorry, persuasion.

01:15:22.433 --> 01:15:23.516
LIAM: Persu-eption.

01:15:24.633 --> 01:15:29.032
MARISHA: That's what I was getting
at. This is my strong suit.

01:15:29.032 --> 01:15:33.241
Ooh, I rolled a 19, though, for 20 total!

01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:35.571
MATT: All righty.
(laughter)

01:15:35.571 --> 01:15:36.663
LIAM: I'm a real boy!
MARISHA: That's the most first--

01:15:36.663 --> 01:15:38.379
I did it, you guys!

01:15:39.573 --> 01:15:41.941
MATT: Little bit of haggling, little bit surprising yourself

01:15:41.941 --> 01:15:44.524
in this circumstance, but you manage to,

01:15:45.471 --> 01:15:50.471
between the chalice and about 150 gold's worth

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:53.551
of smaller diamonds of various sizes,

01:15:53.551 --> 01:15:55.751
some that are used for ring insets, some that are used

01:15:55.751 --> 01:16:00.151
for earrings and other bits of accessory jewelry,

01:16:00.151 --> 01:16:04.084
about 150 gold worth, you get it all for

01:16:05.251 --> 01:16:06.971
1,150.

01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:07.804
MARISHA: Deal.

01:16:07.804 --> 01:16:09.804
MATT: So you knock 100 gold off the whole deal with the 20.

01:16:09.804 --> 01:16:10.781
ASHLEY: Tight.

01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:12.321
MARISHA: I'll pay for it.

01:16:12.321 --> 01:16:13.154
ASHLEY: Good haggling.

01:16:13.154 --> 01:16:14.471
TRAVIS: Holding.

01:16:14.471 --> 01:16:16.081
MARISHA: He thought I was smooth.

01:16:16.081 --> 01:16:17.361
ASHLEY: Dude, you were.

01:16:17.361 --> 01:16:18.531
MARISHA: Smoothest I've ever been.

01:16:18.531 --> 01:16:20.085
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was amazing.
MARISHA: Pretty great, thanks.

01:16:20.085 --> 01:16:21.772
ASHLEY: Yeah, no, good work.

01:16:23.155 --> 01:16:24.822
MATT: Anything else?
MARISHA: Maybe I should go into sales.

01:16:28.321 --> 01:16:31.961
LIAM: No, I'm feeling we are going to un-spice pretty soon

01:16:31.961 --> 01:16:33.894
and we need to be moving on anyway.

01:16:36.348 --> 01:16:37.181
TALIESIN: Let's call it.

01:16:37.181 --> 01:16:38.621
LIAM: That's a good look for you.

01:16:38.621 --> 01:16:40.371
TALIESIN: Thank you. I know, I feel dapper.

01:16:42.211 --> 01:16:43.044
LIAM: It works.

01:16:43.044 --> 01:16:44.451
TALIESIN: Probably drop the accent, though.

01:16:44.451 --> 01:16:49.171
That was a-- experiment's been going poorly lately.

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:51.375
LIAM: You're better at accents than I am.

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:53.208
TALIESIN: I don't know, you've got a--

01:16:54.411 --> 01:16:55.720
show me something.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.045
LIAM: (low-pitched, slow, American accent) Oh, Wild Mother.

01:17:01.191 --> 01:17:03.241
MARISHA: No, you're better-- you're better than him.

01:17:03.241 --> 01:17:04.818
TALIESIN: Wow.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:17:04.818 --> 01:17:05.651
TALIESIN: Had a good tone, though.

01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:08.306
I thought you were going to start chanting.

01:17:08.306 --> 01:17:10.894
LIAM: Mm, bop bop.

01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:12.241
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:17:12.241 --> 01:17:13.681
That's a good one, that slaps.

01:17:13.681 --> 01:17:17.571
SAM: Heh.
MARISHA: Mm, mm.

01:17:17.571 --> 01:17:20.216
(laughter)

01:17:20.216 --> 01:17:22.737
LIAM: Well, let's go, because tick tock.

01:17:24.751 --> 01:17:27.733
MARISHA: Before two become one, oh!

01:17:27.733 --> 01:17:31.154
MATT: As you guys are making your return in that direction,

01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:33.131
we'll go ahead and move over

01:17:33.131 --> 01:17:34.511
to those who have stayed behind.

01:17:34.511 --> 01:17:39.293
So Jester and Veth, what would you like

01:17:39.293 --> 01:17:40.844
to do while the others are away?

01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:47.451
SAM: Hang out with my son, play,

01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:49.434
entertain, could give him a tour.

01:17:50.351 --> 01:17:53.621
See if there's any pictures to show him

01:17:53.621 --> 01:17:57.491
or anything fun to snoop around to look at.

01:17:57.491 --> 01:17:58.324
LAURA: Yeah.

01:17:58.324 --> 01:18:01.081
MATT: There is-- a storage room has been altered

01:18:01.081 --> 01:18:03.941
and cleared out and a bed has been moved

01:18:03.941 --> 01:18:05.721
from another room into this one

01:18:05.721 --> 01:18:08.341
to give it a little more of a private space.

01:18:08.341 --> 01:18:12.464
But it's a large bed. It'll easily fit both Yeza and Luc.

01:18:14.011 --> 01:18:16.731
It smells a little dingy, but it's not terrible,

01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:17.921
especially given the short notice

01:18:17.921 --> 01:18:19.954
that they were given here to prepare for it.

01:18:21.351 --> 01:18:23.481
There are a lot of other rooms that are locked.

01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:25.754
SAM: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Intentionally so.

01:18:27.571 --> 01:18:30.497
But you go ahead and do a little pass around the vicinity.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:32.857
SAM: I could unlock some of them, but I won't, I won't.

01:18:32.857 --> 01:18:35.264
I won't abuse our host.

01:18:37.481 --> 01:18:39.551
No, that's it, just a little tour around

01:18:39.551 --> 01:18:42.871
and I don't know how long they were gone, but you know.

01:18:44.571 --> 01:18:48.151
Just hanging out, and also peeking

01:18:48.151 --> 01:18:50.891
every once in a while on Marion, seeing how she's doing

01:18:50.891 --> 01:18:55.891
and if she's made any moves to The Gentleman, maybe.

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:59.971
LAURA: I'm distracting her at the table, telling her stories

01:18:59.971 --> 01:19:02.411
and you know, just trying to keep things light

01:19:02.411 --> 01:19:05.306
while also keeping an eye on The Gentleman.

01:19:06.851 --> 01:19:10.651
MATT: He has not left his room. (laughs)

01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:13.071
But Marion is very happy to catch up with you.

01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:15.791
She's adjusting to this unfamiliar space

01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:18.441
and is liking the attention and with her presence, too,

01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:20.691
you can see a lot of people in the room,

01:19:20.691 --> 01:19:23.461
a lot of the employees of The Gentleman

01:19:23.461 --> 01:19:26.611
who at first were taken aback and awkward

01:19:26.611 --> 01:19:28.871
are starting to listen in, too.

01:19:28.871 --> 01:19:30.471
They're starting to get invested in these tales

01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:31.781
that your mom is telling.

01:19:31.781 --> 01:19:36.221
And once again, she carries a room.

01:19:36.221 --> 01:19:38.221
She definitely-- it's hard for eyes not

01:19:38.221 --> 01:19:40.205
to eventually fall upon her with her

01:19:40.205 --> 01:19:42.291
force of personality and charisma.

01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:44.141
And as you guys are talking,

01:19:44.141 --> 01:19:45.441
there are a few moments where you stop

01:19:45.441 --> 01:19:49.601
and extend your awareness beyond just the two of you,

01:19:49.601 --> 01:19:51.531
and you can tell the whole room is leaning

01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:55.751
in your direction, but yeah.

01:19:55.751 --> 01:19:58.611
She seems to be in better spirits

01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:02.091
now that you're out of this chaos

01:20:02.091 --> 01:20:04.794
that you've been dragged through these past day and a half.

01:20:05.933 --> 01:20:08.092
But she goes, "Jester, I...

01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:16.021
"I get the sense with everything you've told me

01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:19.001
"that what you're all going to do...

01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:25.740
"All of this sounds extremely dangerous.

01:20:30.441 --> 01:20:34.851
"And I know you will do wonderfully.

01:20:34.851 --> 01:20:39.034
"You have every time. You continue to surprise everyone.

01:20:40.131 --> 01:20:44.451
"You consistently break expectations.

01:20:44.451 --> 01:20:48.221
"You, my sapphire, are capable of anything."

01:20:56.378 --> 01:20:57.686
LAURA: It's, um--

01:20:59.231 --> 01:21:00.524
It's very dangerous.

01:21:04.571 --> 01:21:08.754
I don't know what exactly we are going to have to do.

01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:16.831
The last time we tried to go against these people, we--

01:21:19.811 --> 01:21:21.034
It went really bad.

01:21:31.181 --> 01:21:34.144
I didn't want to tell you.

01:21:41.775 --> 01:21:43.733
I don't know--

01:21:45.995 --> 01:21:47.845
I don't know if we'll come back.

01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:52.974
I think we will, I hope we will.

01:21:54.501 --> 01:21:59.051
But if we have to stop them

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:03.925
and it takes us with it,

01:22:03.925 --> 01:22:07.951
then that, I think, will be worth it.

01:22:07.951 --> 01:22:09.174
That will be worth it.

01:22:10.691 --> 01:22:14.262
MATT: She puts her hands out, clasps yours in hers.

01:22:20.991 --> 01:22:25.991
"Sometimes, fate brings us

01:22:26.201 --> 01:22:28.802
"to places we never expected to be.

01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:36.271
"And there are rare moments

01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:40.121
"where individuals have the chance

01:22:41.021 --> 01:22:45.629
"to really change

01:22:48.254 --> 01:22:51.403
"the future for everyone else.

01:22:51.403 --> 01:22:54.681
"To protect those who may or may not not know

01:22:54.681 --> 01:22:56.531
"they need protecting.

01:23:00.981 --> 01:23:02.326
"And it's...

01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:06.021
"I am challenged to find the words

01:23:06.021 --> 01:23:08.904
"to describe how proud I am of everything that you've done.

01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:19.775
"But you are my sapphire,

01:23:21.284 --> 01:23:23.117
"and I want you safe.

01:23:24.181 --> 01:23:27.939
"I don't want a martyr for a daughter."

01:23:27.939 --> 01:23:30.914
"I don't want a martyr for a daughter."

01:23:33.097 --> 01:23:37.168
LAURA: I don't want to be a martyr. I want to come home.

01:23:37.168 --> 01:23:38.901
MATT: "Good.

01:23:44.321 --> 01:23:46.063
"Promise me that you will.

01:23:49.161 --> 01:23:53.052
"If it begins to look very bad,

01:23:55.569 --> 01:23:57.452
"that you come home."

01:24:07.544 --> 01:24:08.977
LAURA: I promise.

01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:17.797
MATT: "(sighs) I'm sorry, I know
I'm being a little selfish here,

01:24:17.797 --> 01:24:19.247
"but--"
LAURA: No.

01:24:25.788 --> 01:24:26.871
MATT: "Just--"

01:24:31.531 --> 01:24:34.441
LAURA: It'll be okay, Mama.

01:24:34.441 --> 01:24:35.299
MATT: "You're so smart,

01:24:35.299 --> 01:24:40.041
"and you have such talented friends around you.

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.992
"I have all the faith.

01:24:44.829 --> 01:24:46.461
"And you're smarter than all of them,

01:24:46.461 --> 01:24:48.693
"so if they need to be reminded--"

01:24:48.693 --> 01:24:51.834
LAURA: Some of them are really smart, really smart.

01:24:53.691 --> 01:24:55.274
MATT: "But none are you."

01:25:00.531 --> 01:25:02.064
LAURA: You'll be safe here.

01:25:03.602 --> 01:25:06.894
And you don't need to stay forever, just, you know...

01:25:10.781 --> 01:25:11.878
Just for a while.

01:25:14.696 --> 01:25:16.354
MATT: "All right."
LAURA: Okay.

01:25:19.441 --> 01:25:23.121
Maybe you can give a concert later, that could be fun.

01:25:23.121 --> 01:25:24.851
A secret concert, that could be bad.

01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:26.031
Don't give a concert. That would

01:25:26.031 --> 01:25:27.478
let people know you were here.

01:25:27.478 --> 01:25:28.986
That was stupid, don't do that.

01:25:30.081 --> 01:25:34.091
Just for Papa, (laughs) or not, if you don't want to.

01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:35.711
Oh my gosh.

01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:38.141
MATT: She reaches out and grabs the edge of your chin

01:25:38.141 --> 01:25:40.091
and just makes you look at her.

01:25:41.831 --> 01:25:43.944
You can see her eyes watering.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.640
"I'm proud of you."

01:25:54.928 --> 01:25:56.567
LAURA: I'm so proud of you.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.791
MATT: "I know you'll come back."

01:26:06.221 --> 01:26:07.362
LAURA: Of course.

01:26:10.501 --> 01:26:12.354
MATT: "It seems, eventually, everyone does."

01:26:13.271 --> 01:26:15.734
She looks off, towards the staircase.

01:26:18.348 --> 01:26:20.251
LAURA: He'll come down soon enough.

01:26:20.251 --> 01:26:22.611
MATT: "I don't know if he will. He seemed pretty spooked."

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.934
LAURA: Well, nobody's gone up there.

01:26:29.161 --> 01:26:31.291
MATT: She takes her wine and drinks heavily.

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:33.344
(laughter)
Sets it down.

01:26:35.071 --> 01:26:37.664
"(sighs)" And she stands up,

01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:42.171
grabs and squeezes your hand for a moment.

01:26:43.181 --> 01:26:47.023
Begins humming under her breath (hums)

01:26:47.023 --> 01:26:50.181
and then slowly walks through the room

01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:52.864
towards the stairs.
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.529
LAURA: I just watch her.

01:26:59.899 --> 01:27:02.608
MATT: Yeza's in the process of,

01:27:02.608 --> 01:27:06.321
"I mean, I can imagine all the number of chemicals

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:09.311
"would be useful for somebody who works

01:27:09.311 --> 01:27:12.881
"beneath the laws of the empire.

01:27:12.881 --> 01:27:17.305
"Poisons, toxins, caustic materials.

01:27:17.305 --> 01:27:20.081
"(stammers) I don't even know what would be needed."

01:27:20.081 --> 01:27:23.721
SAM: What would be needed to work
<i>with</i> the empire, you mean?

01:27:23.721 --> 01:27:25.211
MATT: "No, no, no, what would The Gentleman need?"

01:27:25.211 --> 01:27:26.044
SAM: Oh, I don't know.

01:27:26.044 --> 01:27:28.438
Well, I mean, he's into all sorts

01:27:28.438 --> 01:27:33.068
of underworldy-type businesses.

01:27:33.068 --> 01:27:38.068
He might need chemicals to identify precious stones.

01:27:38.626 --> 01:27:39.796
MATT: "Okay."

01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:43.938
SAM: Chemicals to drug people or to cure people

01:27:43.938 --> 01:27:45.291
from being drugged as well.

01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.418
MATT: "Okay, okay, yeah.

01:27:46.418 --> 01:27:48.783
"I kind of offered my services without thinking it through.

01:27:48.783 --> 01:27:49.706
"It just sounded cool at the moment,

01:27:49.706 --> 01:27:51.089
"but then now it's really bad, but--"

01:27:51.089 --> 01:27:52.801
SAM: No, no, no, I think this is the stuff

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:57.461
of cutting edge alchemy that you'd be perfect for.

01:27:57.461 --> 01:28:00.731
It's fine and all to just make the standard,

01:28:00.731 --> 01:28:03.271
same mixtures every day of your life.

01:28:03.271 --> 01:28:05.991
But if you get to do some interesting, new stuff

01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:10.761
and blaze a trail, that could be really interesting.

01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:11.681
MATT: "Interesting?"

01:28:11.681 --> 01:28:14.961
SAM: Yes! You know,

01:28:16.141 --> 01:28:19.593
you could have your own sort of adventures

01:28:20.635 --> 01:28:21.881
within chemistry, of course.

01:28:21.881 --> 01:28:24.681
But, I mean, coming up with something new

01:28:24.681 --> 01:28:27.381
that no one else has done before, inventing something.

01:28:33.311 --> 01:28:34.936
MATT: "What if it's illegal?"

01:28:36.971 --> 01:28:40.148
SAM: Well, yeah, I mean, there's that.

01:28:43.292 --> 01:28:46.661
But you know, I can ask what the laws are

01:28:46.661 --> 01:28:47.494
on that sort of thing.

01:28:47.494 --> 01:28:50.814
I don't think a chemical can be illegal.

01:28:51.851 --> 01:28:53.771
Maybe how it's used can be, but--

01:28:53.771 --> 01:28:55.401
MATT: "Right, right."
SAM: You're okay.

01:28:55.401 --> 01:28:57.018
I mean, I don't think there's rules against,

01:28:57.018 --> 01:28:59.706
like, you can't own this chemical.
MATT: "Plausible deniability.

01:28:59.706 --> 01:29:02.141
"Yeah, yeah."
SAM: Yeah.

01:29:02.141 --> 01:29:03.266
MATT: "Oh boy.

01:29:08.253 --> 01:29:10.343
"(sighs) What are we doing?"

01:29:10.343 --> 01:29:13.448
SAM: (chuckles) I don't know.

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:16.554
I'm a really bad parent.

01:29:18.051 --> 01:29:20.531
MATT: You look over and Luc is curled up

01:29:20.531 --> 01:29:22.491
and passed out in the chair next to the table.

01:29:22.491 --> 01:29:26.236
He's burned his energy out from his initial arrival.

01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:28.551
And Yeza rubs the hair

01:29:28.551 --> 01:29:30.184
out of his forehead a little bit.

01:29:31.661 --> 01:29:32.961
"I don't think that's true.

01:29:35.001 --> 01:29:36.575
"I think we're learning how to parent."

01:29:36.575 --> 01:29:37.616
SAM: Mm-hm.

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:43.581
MATT: "And maybe, maybe not chose the safest gifts

01:29:43.581 --> 01:29:46.330
"to give him at times, but--

01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:48.471
"but we're figuring it out."

01:29:48.471 --> 01:29:52.772
SAM: I just want him to be happy and I-- you know.

01:29:54.461 --> 01:29:56.391
I know what he really needs is just time,

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:59.351
time with me and time with us as a family.

01:29:59.351 --> 01:30:01.911
That's what I really want to give him.

01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:05.554
In the meantime, I've tried to give him things

01:30:05.554 --> 01:30:08.174
to make him happy and excited.

01:30:10.151 --> 01:30:14.817
Distract, but he needs us all together,

01:30:15.984 --> 01:30:17.771
very soon.

01:30:17.771 --> 01:30:19.381
I need it, too.

01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:20.721
MATT: "I need it, too."

01:30:20.721 --> 01:30:21.946
SAM: Yeah.

01:30:26.331 --> 01:30:29.764
Hopefully, this will all be over soon.

01:30:30.909 --> 01:30:32.175
MATT: "I hope so."

01:30:38.151 --> 01:30:41.484
SAM: Thank you for-- thank you for coming and

01:30:42.868 --> 01:30:46.418
for being in this stale beer-smelling place

01:30:47.311 --> 01:30:48.234
with our son.

01:30:49.611 --> 01:30:51.721
MATT: "You know, it's life experience

01:30:51.721 --> 01:30:54.181
"and it's going to make for some pretty funny stories

01:30:54.181 --> 01:30:56.519
"when he gets older."
SAM: Mm-hmm, yup.

01:30:58.751 --> 01:31:00.314
Wonder what he's going to be like.

01:31:01.991 --> 01:31:04.084
Maybe he'll rebel and be super boring.

01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:07.091
MATT: "That would be a rebellion."
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:12.039
MATT: "(sighs) If he's anything like you, at least.

01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:24.430
"This the last one for a while?"

01:31:26.281 --> 01:31:28.164
SAM: I think this is the last one, yeah.

01:31:29.911 --> 01:31:30.744
MATT: "Okay."

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:34.891
SAM: God, I hope so.

01:31:34.891 --> 01:31:38.154
I mean, I can't imagine anything bigger than this.

01:31:40.331 --> 01:31:44.524
And if there is, then no thanks.

01:31:46.741 --> 01:31:49.211
No, I'd rather be here.

01:31:49.211 --> 01:31:50.641
Well, not here, this is gross.

01:31:50.641 --> 01:31:52.721
MATT: "This is, yeah, it's not optimal."

01:31:52.721 --> 01:31:55.121
SAM: But you know, with you.
LAURA: Hey.

01:31:55.121 --> 01:31:56.451
SAM: Sorry.

01:31:56.451 --> 01:31:57.391
LAURA: I go back to doodling

01:31:57.391 --> 01:31:59.841
on the table.
MATT: (laughs)

01:31:59.841 --> 01:32:01.261
SAM: Anyway, yes.

01:32:01.261 --> 01:32:03.209
MATT: "There's some cool places in Nicodranas

01:32:03.209 --> 01:32:04.791
"that I've scouted out that I want to show you

01:32:04.791 --> 01:32:06.441
"when we get a chance."
SAM: Oh yeah?

01:32:07.751 --> 01:32:11.161
Different places to live or to work, or both?

01:32:11.161 --> 01:32:12.936
MATT: "Different places to show you.

01:32:14.961 --> 01:32:18.281
"You don't, I'm learning, have to have a motive

01:32:18.281 --> 01:32:21.121
"for everything you want to do.

01:32:21.121 --> 01:32:23.571
"Sometimes fun for fun's sake."

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:26.244
SAM: (chuckles) That sounds novel.

01:32:29.391 --> 01:32:31.041
I'd love to see them.

01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:34.971
And I love Nicodranas, everything but the water.

01:32:34.971 --> 01:32:36.571
I mean, the rest of it is great.

01:32:37.881 --> 01:32:39.281
I think we could live there.

01:32:40.361 --> 01:32:41.519
MATT: "I think so."

01:32:43.521 --> 01:32:44.354
SAM: All right.

01:32:45.801 --> 01:32:48.854
Two weeks, we'll start a new life together.

01:32:50.011 --> 01:32:53.241
MATT: "Okay, two weeks. I'm holding you to that."

01:32:53.241 --> 01:32:54.249
SAM: Feel free.

01:32:55.656 --> 01:32:56.854
MATT: He gives you a little kiss.

01:32:59.931 --> 01:33:01.301
While the rest of you are returning--

01:33:01.301 --> 01:33:03.651
LAURA: Oh, can I walk over before?

01:33:03.651 --> 01:33:04.928
MATT: Sure, yeah.

01:33:04.928 --> 01:33:08.242
LAURA: And just say, "Hey, love birds.

01:33:09.196 --> 01:33:11.696
"You need some time,

01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:14.891
"I can watch the little one."

01:33:14.891 --> 01:33:18.311
SAM: That's very kind of you, Jester, but--

01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:20.111
LAURA: For boning and also for making stuff.

01:33:20.111 --> 01:33:21.191
I thought you were going to make something.

01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:22.711
SAM: We are going to make stuff.

01:33:22.711 --> 01:33:26.381
I mean, he is asleep, but if you want to do

01:33:26.381 --> 01:33:29.173
some bomb making right now, I'm cool with it.

01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:31.347
MATT: "Yeah?"
TRAVIS: Bomb making.

01:33:31.347 --> 01:33:34.141
LAURA: Yeah, I can watch Luc, totally.

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:37.281
MATT: "Okay, let's go-- let's go make some bombs."

01:33:37.281 --> 01:33:39.691
SAM: Okay, yeah.
MATT: "Yeah."

01:33:39.691 --> 01:33:41.421
SAM: Let's make some bombs.

01:33:41.421 --> 01:33:43.121
MATT: "All right."
(laughter)

01:33:43.121 --> 01:33:45.288
LAURA: Wear yourselves out. Have a good time.

01:33:45.288 --> 01:33:47.221
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: No, but really,

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.001
let's make some bombs.
MATT: "Okay, well, yeah."

01:33:49.961 --> 01:33:52.101
Okay, what did you want to make?

01:33:52.101 --> 01:33:55.731
SAM: I have material to make, I think, two Fluffernutters.

01:33:55.731 --> 01:33:56.591
MATT: All righty.

01:33:56.591 --> 01:33:59.651
SAM: Or maybe one really powerful Fluffernutter,

01:33:59.651 --> 01:34:01.031
I don't know.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:02.650
LIAM: Still all euphemism.

01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:05.101
(laughter)

01:34:05.101 --> 01:34:07.698
MATT: Your choice, two regular or one powerful?

01:34:07.698 --> 01:34:09.281
SAM: How about two regs?

01:34:09.281 --> 01:34:10.701
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Always go [inaudible].

01:34:10.701 --> 01:34:12.091
SAM: Because one could fuck up.

01:34:12.091 --> 01:34:12.924
LAURA: That's true.

01:34:12.924 --> 01:34:15.634
MATT: So you have proficiency in alchemist tools?

01:34:17.571 --> 01:34:18.711
Or alchemy kit, or?

01:34:18.711 --> 01:34:22.321
SAM: I believe I-- well, I wouldn't have it anymore

01:34:22.321 --> 01:34:23.731
because it would have been stolen

01:34:23.731 --> 01:34:25.531
with all of our stuff.
LAURA: The alchemy kit, yeah.

01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:29.291
MATT: Right, Yeza would have-- oh, but he had to rush off.

01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:32.281
SAM: But when we were at somewhere recently,

01:34:32.281 --> 01:34:35.781
I bought a bunch of materials to make these things.

01:34:35.781 --> 01:34:38.991
MATT: You did, you did, you're right.
SAM: The components that I would need.

01:34:38.991 --> 01:34:40.211
LAURA: So you probably would have bought another one,

01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:41.467
because that was after our stuff got stolen.

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:43.621
MATT: And to be fair, anything you didn't have,

01:34:43.621 --> 01:34:45.613
The Gentleman's facility probably has something

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:46.714
that could work for it.
SAM: Hm, nice.

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:49.503
MATT: So okay, I'll allow it.

01:34:49.503 --> 01:34:52.401
So if you were are proficient, is what I'm saying,

01:34:52.401 --> 01:34:54.166
with alchemists kit or not?

01:34:55.118 --> 01:34:56.501
SAM: I don't-- how would I know that?

01:34:56.501 --> 01:34:57.751
MATT: It would be under your proficiencies

01:34:57.751 --> 01:35:00.131
in the lower left.

01:35:00.131 --> 01:35:02.175
SAM: Under proficiencies and languages, it says,

01:35:02.175 --> 01:35:03.901
"Tools: alchemist supplies."

01:35:03.901 --> 01:35:05.288
MATT: Yeah, great.
SAM: Okay, great!

01:35:05.288 --> 01:35:06.121
MATT: So go ahead--

01:35:06.121 --> 01:35:08.718
go ahead and roll a d20, add your proficiency modifier

01:35:08.718 --> 01:35:10.261
and your intelligence modifier,

01:35:10.261 --> 01:35:12.734
with advantage because Yeza's helping you.

01:35:12.734 --> 01:35:14.691
SAM: Okay, that's terrible.

01:35:14.691 --> 01:35:17.621
Proficiency and what?
MARISHA: Aw, you having a little Ghost moment?

01:35:17.621 --> 01:35:18.741
TALIESIN: Intelligence.

01:35:18.741 --> 01:35:21.269
MATT: They're both just pouring
the chemicals. He's behind her.

01:35:21.269 --> 01:35:23.406
SAM: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
(laughter)

01:35:23.406 --> 01:35:24.926
MATT: Oh my god.

01:35:24.926 --> 01:35:27.831
LIAM: Oh, don't mix those!
LAURA: ♪ Oh my love ♪

01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:30.091
SAM: My proficiency is five, yes?

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:32.192
That's not great.

01:35:34.831 --> 01:35:36.771
14.
(laughter)

01:35:36.771 --> 01:35:38.591
MATT: That's not bad, that's not bad.

01:35:38.591 --> 01:35:40.111
LAURA: Not great.

01:35:40.111 --> 01:35:41.374
MATT: No, that's not bad.

01:35:42.651 --> 01:35:44.801
If you were making the the big one,

01:35:44.801 --> 01:35:46.351
that might've been something else.

01:35:46.351 --> 01:35:48.409
But you go ahead and you barely,

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.759
barely craft a Fluffernutter.
SAM: Oh wait, plus intelligence, you said?

01:35:50.759 --> 01:35:52.929
MATT: Plus intelligence modifier.
SAM: Oh, 15, okay.

01:35:52.929 --> 01:35:54.001
That's still slightly better.

01:35:54.001 --> 01:35:57.081
MATT: Okay, yeah, you barely pull off a Fluffernutter.

01:35:57.081 --> 01:35:59.894
Do you want to go ahead and try for the second one?

01:35:59.894 --> 01:36:01.973
SAM: Woo! That was refreshing.

01:36:01.973 --> 01:36:03.748
LAURA: Maybe this time, Yeza can be in front.

01:36:03.748 --> 01:36:06.429
(laughter)

01:36:06.429 --> 01:36:08.483
LIAM: I need to wait five minutes before the next one.

01:36:08.483 --> 01:36:09.499
SAM: Natural 20!

01:36:09.499 --> 01:36:11.561
LAURA: Yay! (claps)
ASHLEY: Eyy!

01:36:11.561 --> 01:36:13.451
MATT: For a total of?

01:36:13.451 --> 01:36:18.011
SAM: 20 plus proficiency is 25, plus intelligence, 28.

01:36:18.011 --> 01:36:20.791
LAURA: Wait, your intelligence is three?

01:36:20.791 --> 01:36:23.222
SAM: I'm doing the plus three on intelligence?

01:36:23.222 --> 01:36:24.870
MATT: Yeah, your modifier.
SAM: Yeah, my modifier.

01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:26.436
That's right, that's right?
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

01:36:26.436 --> 01:36:28.921
TALIESIN: Should have been 17--
LAURA: Yeah, your last addition

01:36:28.921 --> 01:36:29.931
was fucked on your--

01:36:29.931 --> 01:36:32.131
SAM: No, I looked at the wrong thing.

01:36:32.131 --> 01:36:33.656
I added two instead of three.

01:36:33.656 --> 01:36:35.298
LAURA: Oh, okay.
SAM: I don't know.

01:36:35.298 --> 01:36:37.047
MATT: Don't doubt his math!

01:36:37.047 --> 01:36:38.461
It's fine, it's fine.
SAM: No, no, it's--

01:36:38.461 --> 01:36:39.851
I was wrong.

01:36:39.851 --> 01:36:43.011
MATT: All right, so go ahead and you make a Fluffernutter.

01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:45.052
And you make a Fluffernutter with an asterisk.

01:36:45.052 --> 01:36:46.691
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh.

01:36:46.691 --> 01:36:48.091
TRAVIS: Yo.
LAURA: That's exciting.

01:36:48.091 --> 01:36:49.058
MATT: So just write that down.

01:36:49.058 --> 01:36:50.219
LIAM: That means twins.

01:36:50.219 --> 01:36:51.751
SAM: Hmm, Fluffernutter--
ASHLEY: Ooh!

01:36:51.751 --> 01:36:53.177
LAURA: That means you also got pregnant.

01:36:53.177 --> 01:36:54.934
(laughter)

01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:56.250
TRAVIS: No, Lucian, don't!

01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:57.533
I'm with child.

01:36:58.851 --> 01:37:00.821
SAM: Okay, thank you, thank you.

01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:04.891
MATT: All righty, while the rest of you are returning

01:37:04.891 --> 01:37:07.681
from your shopping trip, you pick up some general supplies.

01:37:07.681 --> 01:37:10.141
Yasha, based on the requests that were made,

01:37:10.141 --> 01:37:14.671
you pick up general food, dried goods, milk, juice

01:37:14.671 --> 01:37:16.811
anything else that they do not seem to have

01:37:16.811 --> 01:37:19.111
or are able to provide at the moment,

01:37:19.111 --> 01:37:20.791
until they begin to take care

01:37:20.791 --> 01:37:25.791
of their guests for the time being, as they're heading back.

01:37:29.048 --> 01:37:32.304
(as Trent) "You run like you carry a guilty conscience.

01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:37.591
"Absolve yourself and tell me why I shouldn't continue

01:37:37.591 --> 01:37:42.591
"to pursue." You hear in the center of your head, Caleb.

01:37:42.978 --> 01:37:45.878
MARISHA: He's so up in your DMs.

01:37:51.571 --> 01:37:55.583
LIAM: For once in your very little life,

01:37:57.863 --> 01:38:02.206
consider that there are things
larger than your own machinations.

01:38:03.981 --> 01:38:05.728
Take some time off.

01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:15.603
MATT: No response yet.

01:38:18.681 --> 01:38:20.356
LIAM: Zero confidence in that.

01:38:24.956 --> 01:38:27.501
MATT: So you all eventually regather,

01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:28.951
down in The Gentleman's lair.

01:38:31.063 --> 01:38:32.204
What would you like to do?

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:38.441
LIAM: Well, first, I don't know if Pumat is price gouging

01:38:38.641 --> 01:38:42.521
or what, but it was too steep for us.

01:38:42.521 --> 01:38:43.961
And I didn't really see-- I was really

01:38:43.961 --> 01:38:46.011
just doing it for old time's sake.

01:38:46.011 --> 01:38:48.701
I just-- I love being here, I love his shop,

01:38:48.701 --> 01:38:53.701
but it was not cost-effective, so here's your gold back.

01:38:54.171 --> 01:38:55.191
Your platinum back.

01:38:55.191 --> 01:38:57.234
SAM: How much do you have just in general?

01:38:57.234 --> 01:38:58.611
LIAM: Like four hundo.

01:38:58.611 --> 01:39:00.861
SAM: Why don't you take another six hundo,

01:39:00.861 --> 01:39:02.691
just so you have some money.

01:39:02.691 --> 01:39:05.131
LIAM: I don't think they'll have shops where we're going.

01:39:05.131 --> 01:39:07.421
SAM: Yeah, but what if you have to barter

01:39:07.421 --> 01:39:10.807
with a fey creature or something, I don't know.

01:39:12.187 --> 01:39:13.945
LAURA: Fey creatures don't want gold.

01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:17.571
LIAM: Eh, give it to your husband, save it for your kid.

01:39:17.571 --> 01:39:18.404
SAM: Okay.

01:39:20.311 --> 01:39:23.261
ASHLEY: I got a lot of groceries for Luc

01:39:23.261 --> 01:39:25.154
and for Yeza.
SAM: Oh, thank you!

01:39:26.025 --> 01:39:27.908
ASHLEY: We've got enchanted oats.

01:39:27.908 --> 01:39:28.741
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

01:39:30.011 --> 01:39:34.491
ASHLEY: A lot of it is just way too sugary sweet cereals,

01:39:34.491 --> 01:39:37.191
and then weird food like bugs and--

01:39:37.191 --> 01:39:39.298
LIAM: Enchant--
(laughter)

01:39:39.298 --> 01:39:40.264
LIAM: Enchantios?

01:39:40.264 --> 01:39:43.451
ASHLEY: All of the important food

01:39:43.451 --> 01:39:44.861
and protein you would need.
SAM: Did you grow up

01:39:44.861 --> 01:39:46.311
on this stuff?

01:39:46.311 --> 01:39:47.661
ASHLEY: No, I've never tried it,

01:39:47.661 --> 01:39:50.231
but it was so colorful, so I bought it.

01:39:50.231 --> 01:39:52.036
SAM: Thank you so much, Yasha.

01:39:52.036 --> 01:39:53.136
ASHLEY: Welcome.

01:39:53.136 --> 01:39:55.211
SAM: I think you can keep the bugs

01:39:55.211 --> 01:39:58.129
because we have enough, because we're fine.

01:39:59.071 --> 01:40:00.761
ASHLEY: I wouldn't want to take all these.

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:04.601
I feel like-- he needs to eat.

01:40:04.601 --> 01:40:07.441
SAM: He does. You know what? I'll just take a handful

01:40:07.441 --> 01:40:09.581
because I think we're going to be fine, so.

01:40:09.581 --> 01:40:12.398
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:40:12.398 --> 01:40:15.298
I'll keep them for myself, then. Whew.

01:40:15.298 --> 01:40:17.631
SAM: Thank you, thank you, and one more thing.

01:40:17.631 --> 01:40:20.331
I keep forgetting to do this and I've been meaning to.

01:40:21.841 --> 01:40:24.471
I have a gift for you.

01:40:24.471 --> 01:40:28.381
It's not from me. I was going to do it on our date,

01:40:28.381 --> 01:40:31.141
but you know, sort of fell through.

01:40:31.141 --> 01:40:35.213
But here, I have this really old, dry flower now.

01:40:35.213 --> 01:40:37.571
It's a white flower.
ASHLEY: Aww!

01:40:37.571 --> 01:40:40.991
SAM: It's not from me, it's from that woman-- Vilya?

01:40:40.991 --> 01:40:43.889
Do you remember her from Rumblecusp?

01:40:43.889 --> 01:40:44.974
ASHLEY: Yes, of course.

01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:47.461
SAM: She wanted to give it to you

01:40:47.461 --> 01:40:50.227
and I forgot, I forgot to pass it on.

01:40:50.227 --> 01:40:51.394
ASHLEY: Thank you.

01:40:52.578 --> 01:40:55.014
I'm going to put this in my book and

01:40:56.951 --> 01:40:59.976
lay it in here and I'll press it with the rest.

01:40:59.976 --> 01:41:01.291
SAM: I'm glad.

01:41:01.291 --> 01:41:02.124
ASHLEY: Thank you.

01:41:05.798 --> 01:41:07.048
(sighs)

01:41:07.048 --> 01:41:09.071
MARISHA: Got a jeweled chalice.

01:41:09.071 --> 01:41:09.904
SAM: Oh, shit!
LAURA: Gimme!

01:41:09.904 --> 01:41:10.847
MARISHA: Jester, catch!
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:10.847 --> 01:41:12.086
LIAM: Ooh!

01:41:12.086 --> 01:41:12.919
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:41:12.919 --> 01:41:15.201
LAURA: I'm really good at catching things.

01:41:15.201 --> 01:41:16.375
TALIESIN: I wasn't worried about you.

01:41:16.375 --> 01:41:17.388
MATT: As she drops it.

01:41:17.388 --> 01:41:19.174
(laughter)

01:41:19.174 --> 01:41:20.608
LIAM: Start painting.

01:41:20.608 --> 01:41:22.881
TALIESIN: I got some glue, we can put that back on.

01:41:22.881 --> 01:41:26.055
MARISHA: Caduceus, diamonds. (grunts)

01:41:26.055 --> 01:41:26.946
Yep.

01:41:28.211 --> 01:41:29.763
TALIESIN: Nope.

01:41:29.763 --> 01:41:32.221
(laughter)
MARISHA: (scattering)

01:41:32.221 --> 01:41:33.188
TALIESIN: I got it, one second.

01:41:33.188 --> 01:41:34.089
LIAM: There's the dust.

01:41:34.089 --> 01:41:34.980
TRAVIS: Good thing we got time.

01:41:37.501 --> 01:41:38.334
MARISHA: All right.

01:41:39.921 --> 01:41:40.754
We ready?

01:41:41.901 --> 01:41:43.521
TALIESIN: Nope. (exhales)

01:41:43.521 --> 01:41:44.511
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:41:44.511 --> 01:41:45.381
SAM: Caduceus?
ASHLEY: How are you feeling?

01:41:45.381 --> 01:41:47.724
SAM: Yeah, what are we doing?

01:41:50.401 --> 01:41:53.791
TALIESIN: We are following the Wild Mother,

01:41:53.791 --> 01:41:57.341
who has been helping us along this path.

01:41:57.341 --> 01:42:00.121
And I feel that she...

01:42:02.511 --> 01:42:05.594
wants me to go home, if just briefly.

01:42:07.083 --> 01:42:08.701
There's a reason for it.

01:42:08.701 --> 01:42:11.461
MARISHA: What are you going to do if it's not briefly

01:42:11.461 --> 01:42:12.834
and she wants you to stay?

01:42:13.881 --> 01:42:15.671
TALIESIN: I don't think she does.

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:16.684
MARISHA: Do you?

01:42:16.684 --> 01:42:20.029
TALIESIN: I don't, I mean, I-- wait, what?

01:42:20.029 --> 01:42:21.204
MARISHA: Want to stay?
TALIESIN: I do.

01:42:22.385 --> 01:42:24.480
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: Home.

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.571
TALIESIN: That's a--

01:42:28.879 --> 01:42:30.929
I don't know if that's a fair question.

01:42:33.351 --> 01:42:35.101
MARISHA: Wasn't trying to play mind games.

01:42:36.301 --> 01:42:39.494
TALIESIN: In that case, yes.

01:42:41.471 --> 01:42:42.304
MARISHA: In time?

01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:45.341
TALIESIN: Let's go.

01:42:45.341 --> 01:42:46.174
LAURA: Let's go!

01:42:46.174 --> 01:42:48.281
MATT: (laughs)

01:42:48.281 --> 01:42:49.791
TRAVIS: Short stop.

01:42:49.791 --> 01:42:51.121
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:42:51.121 --> 01:42:53.804
Righty before we leave,

01:42:53.804 --> 01:42:58.120
I'm going to send a message to Yussa.

01:42:59.113 --> 01:43:00.022
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:43:00.022 --> 01:43:01.991
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.
ASHLEY: Oh no!

01:43:01.991 --> 01:43:02.941
TALIESIN: We're the worst.

01:43:02.941 --> 01:43:05.203
LIAM: Yes, we are.
LAURA: To see if he's okay.

01:43:05.203 --> 01:43:06.036
LIAM: Probably not.

01:43:06.036 --> 01:43:09.311
LAURA: Hopefully the message will-- I don't fucking know.

01:43:09.311 --> 01:43:10.861
I'm going to send a message to Yussa.

01:43:10.861 --> 01:43:12.401
SAM: Could he go feed our dog?

01:43:12.401 --> 01:43:14.866
TRAVIS: Or conscious, we don't even know if he's conscious.

01:43:14.866 --> 01:43:17.156
LAURA: I don't know if he's okay, I need to check on him.

01:43:17.156 --> 01:43:18.655
LIAM: He could be--
TALIESIN: (dial tone)

01:43:18.655 --> 01:43:19.755
MARISHA: Yeah, he's still--
TALIESIN: We're sorry, the person

01:43:19.755 --> 01:43:22.231
you are trying to message has been disconnected.

01:43:22.231 --> 01:43:24.021
TRAVIS: Only a few people are going to understand that.

01:43:24.021 --> 01:43:24.979
TALIESIN: I know.

01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:27.578
MARISHA: True.

01:43:27.578 --> 01:43:29.334
MATT: We're dinosaurs. All right.

01:43:29.334 --> 01:43:32.926
LAURA: Yussa, are you okay?

01:43:34.891 --> 01:43:38.434
We sort of came through in a hurry.

01:43:40.511 --> 01:43:44.484
I hope you're okay. I hope you're not mad.

01:43:47.871 --> 01:43:48.884
Are you okay?

01:43:49.746 --> 01:43:50.621
SAM: Oh god.

01:43:51.931 --> 01:43:56.341
MATT: Immediately, you hear this...

01:43:58.691 --> 01:43:59.874
unexpected sound.

01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:06.568
Layers and layers and layers of voices,

01:44:06.568 --> 01:44:07.809
screaming,

01:44:09.535 --> 01:44:11.501
wailing,

01:44:11.501 --> 01:44:13.275
shouting,

01:44:13.275 --> 01:44:14.533
screeching.

01:44:14.533 --> 01:44:15.561
LIAM: Oh no, he's there.

01:44:15.561 --> 01:44:19.744
MATT: Hundreds of voices, thousands of voices.

01:44:23.747 --> 01:44:24.962
And then it ends.

01:44:24.962 --> 01:44:26.581
LIAM and ASHLEY: (gasping)

01:44:26.581 --> 01:44:27.993
MATT: We're going to go to break.

01:44:27.993 --> 01:44:30.910
ALL: (yelling) No!

01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:33.007
MARISHA: What does it mean?

01:44:33.007 --> 01:44:35.031
LIAM: At least we have a friend over there.

01:44:35.031 --> 01:44:36.961
LAURA: That's where he was like, sending his brain

01:44:36.961 --> 01:44:38.280
to the freaking astral plane!

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.721
LIAM: Yeah. He's chilling at the city.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:44:39.721 --> 01:44:41.121
SAM: He's still in it.

01:44:41.121 --> 01:44:42.487
LIAM: Well, his body's in the tower.

01:44:42.487 --> 01:44:44.101
TRAVIS: How did he get there?

01:44:44.101 --> 01:44:45.310
What was he--

01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:47.377
LAURA: Remember, he was astral projecting.

01:44:47.377 --> 01:44:50.041
LIAM: Astral projected self is hanging

01:44:50.041 --> 01:44:51.981
with the Somnovem. Probably.

01:44:51.981 --> 01:44:52.980
LAURA: He's probably trapped right now.
LIAM: Maybe?

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:54.505
MARISHA: Is he trapped?
ASHLEY: Yeah, what if he's stuck?

01:44:54.505 --> 01:44:57.641
SAM: He doesn't have a body to go back to! (gasps)

01:44:57.641 --> 01:45:00.164
TALIESIN: He's got a body, it was right there.

01:45:00.164 --> 01:45:00.997
ASHLEY: His body was there?
LIAM: We hope.

01:45:00.997 --> 01:45:04.254
SAM: His body was probably sliced in half by Ikithon!

01:45:04.254 --> 01:45:05.812
MARISHA: (panicked laugh)

01:45:05.812 --> 01:45:06.887
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:45:06.887 --> 01:45:08.450
MATT: Well, regardless--
MARISHA: No!

01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:09.591
What's happening?

01:45:09.591 --> 01:45:10.733
MATT: We'll come back here in a few minutes.

01:45:10.733 --> 01:45:12.108
MARISHA: Maybe it means we have a contact

01:45:12.108 --> 01:45:13.164
when we get there.
MATT: Sure.

01:45:13.164 --> 01:45:16.152
LIAM: Maybe he's there or--
MARISHA: We can stay in his loft.

01:45:16.152 --> 01:45:17.068
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Is that--

01:45:17.068 --> 01:45:20.590
LAURA: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: Are those three teeth yours?

01:45:20.590 --> 01:45:22.806
MATT: (cackles)

01:45:22.806 --> 01:45:24.043
TALIESIN: Akira out--

01:45:24.043 --> 01:45:25.331
MATT: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:45:25.331 --> 01:45:27.721
All right, we'll see you guys here in a minute.

01:45:28.495 --> 01:45:30.900
The night is darkest before dawn.

01:45:35.159 --> 01:45:39.460
But fear not my child, for dawn is coming.

01:45:49.687 --> 01:45:51.770
Arabell, where are you?

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:59.007
Oh please, no.

01:46:05.727 --> 01:46:08.987
The darkness has taken this world from us,

01:46:08.987 --> 01:46:11.359
how much more will we let it take

01:46:11.359 --> 01:46:13.692
before we have nothing left?

01:46:24.957 --> 01:46:26.830
I'm sorry, we are closed.

01:46:28.587 --> 01:46:29.787
We know she's in here,

01:46:31.247 --> 01:46:33.640
give her up and we'll go easy on you.

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:41.167
We dream at night of a kinder world,

01:46:41.167 --> 01:46:44.410
only to find it slip from our grasp when we wake,

01:46:45.527 --> 01:46:46.427
leaving us broken.

01:46:47.297 --> 01:46:49.380
Ah, we found you.

01:46:51.042 --> 01:46:54.117
(zombie moaning)
(glass breaking)

01:46:54.117 --> 01:46:55.167
There's no way out!

01:46:57.973 --> 01:46:58.943
Push!

01:46:58.943 --> 01:47:01.526
(men groaning)

01:47:02.455 --> 01:47:04.490
(door slamming)

01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:06.647
However, this is not a nightmare

01:47:06.647 --> 01:47:08.917
we will simply wake up from.

01:47:08.917 --> 01:47:09.750
(door breaking)

01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:12.667
(zombies growling)

01:47:15.577 --> 01:47:18.154
Salvation is within all of us,

01:47:18.154 --> 01:47:21.200
all you have to do is fight.

01:47:24.417 --> 01:47:26.140
Fight for the ones we love.

01:47:27.204 --> 01:47:29.454
I'm coming Arabell.

01:47:31.147 --> 01:47:33.068
Fight for who we are.

01:47:33.068 --> 01:47:36.499
(fire bursting)

01:47:36.499 --> 01:47:40.347
Fight against the darkness that seeks to enslave us all.

01:47:41.223 --> 01:47:42.643
(arrows firing)

01:47:42.643 --> 01:47:45.797
For while there is still breath left within us,

01:47:45.797 --> 01:47:47.450
Etheris is not truly lost.

01:48:09.008 --> 01:48:11.827
Dwarvenite,

01:48:11.827 --> 01:48:15.480
the most precious substance among Dwarven smiths.

01:48:17.547 --> 01:48:20.700
Able to absorb the very spirit of the craftsman.

01:48:23.301 --> 01:48:25.968
(magic ringing)

01:48:27.917 --> 01:48:31.890
Thus infused, it becomes nearly indestructible.

01:48:35.207 --> 01:48:39.030
Able to forge heirlooms what will last for generations.

01:48:41.103 --> 01:48:46.103
(smith yelling)
(anvil breaking)

01:48:49.814 --> 01:48:54.187
Pure dwarvenite, now you can get your hands

01:48:54.187 --> 01:48:57.297
on this legendary substance

01:48:57.297 --> 01:49:00.070
with the new Dungeon of Doom.

01:49:01.687 --> 01:49:04.490
Available now at dwarvenforge.com.

01:49:05.521 --> 01:49:08.188
(fire bursting)

01:49:11.377 --> 01:49:13.473
Matt, speaking of never getting old.

01:49:13.473 --> 01:49:14.417
(both laughing)

01:49:14.417 --> 01:49:19.417
You have decided to Zoom into the show from where tonight?

01:49:20.517 --> 01:49:21.976
I'm having a hard time,

01:49:21.976 --> 01:49:25.937
it looks a little bit

01:49:25.937 --> 01:49:29.807
like it's the top of the Statue of Liberty's torch,

01:49:29.807 --> 01:49:31.297
but I'm having, it could be either that,

01:49:31.297 --> 01:49:34.077
maybe the Christ statue of Rio in Brazil,

01:49:34.077 --> 01:49:36.167
where exactly are we tonight?

01:49:36.167 --> 01:49:38.077
To be fair, I had a lot to drink last night,

01:49:38.077 --> 01:49:39.697
so I'm not entirely certain,

01:49:39.697 --> 01:49:43.097
so this is as much a surprise to you as it is to me.

01:49:43.097 --> 01:49:45.477
One of those woke up in a dumpster

01:49:45.477 --> 01:49:47.367
behind Arby nights, huh?

01:49:47.367 --> 01:49:48.817
Yeah, but a little tall for that,

01:49:48.817 --> 01:49:50.247
unless this is a very tall dumpster,

01:49:50.247 --> 01:49:53.967
in which, culturally, we do worship the trash these days.

01:49:53.967 --> 01:49:55.677
Oh wow.
So could very well be--

01:49:55.677 --> 01:49:58.057
Is that a slight on this program?

01:49:58.057 --> 01:49:59.238
No, I don't know what that's a slight on.

01:49:59.238 --> 01:50:01.058
How could you slight on this program?

01:50:01.058 --> 01:50:02.660
(all laughing)

01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:04.847
You can slight something that's at the bottom.

01:50:04.847 --> 01:50:06.097
Yeah, I was just gonna say,

01:50:06.097 --> 01:50:07.934
I was just gonna say.

01:50:13.042 --> 01:50:16.042
(typewriter typing)

01:50:37.837 --> 01:50:39.957
Hey critters, Laura Bailey here,

01:50:39.957 --> 01:50:43.010
let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:44.987
(bees buzzing)

01:50:44.987 --> 01:50:47.190
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:53.200
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

01:50:56.827 --> 01:50:58.800
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

01:51:00.281 --> 01:51:01.657
(crow cawing)

01:51:01.657 --> 01:51:04.300
Oh goodie, you can look just like my brother.

01:51:07.726 --> 01:51:09.177
I mean, the Traveler always says

01:51:09.177 --> 01:51:11.480
impulse purchase are a good decision.

01:51:13.585 --> 01:51:14.418
(mouse clicking)

01:51:14.418 --> 01:51:16.337
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

01:51:17.347 --> 01:51:19.257
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break,

01:51:19.257 --> 01:51:20.207
you still got time.

01:51:24.565 --> 01:51:26.057
(stool rattling)

01:51:26.057 --> 01:51:29.857
Hello everyone, it's me, Marisha Ray,

01:51:29.857 --> 01:51:32.607
Creative Director for Critical Role content,

01:51:32.607 --> 01:51:34.727
and I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

01:51:34.727 --> 01:51:37.807
about how much we appreciate your support,

01:51:37.807 --> 01:51:42.217
no frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

01:51:42.217 --> 01:51:43.367
Over the past five years

01:51:43.367 --> 01:51:46.067
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

01:51:46.067 --> 01:51:49.497
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

01:51:49.497 --> 01:51:52.007
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor,

01:51:52.007 --> 01:51:55.507
cheap costumes and putting our loyal employees

01:51:55.507 --> 01:51:57.377
in slightly embarrassing situations

01:51:57.377 --> 01:52:00.527
eagerly hoping that we've captured your attention.

01:52:00.527 --> 01:52:04.037
Today I am not resorting to edge lord jokes

01:52:04.037 --> 01:52:06.607
written by Brian W Foster,

01:52:06.607 --> 01:52:08.637
or dressing Sam as a celebrity

01:52:08.637 --> 01:52:12.517
to recreate an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

01:52:12.517 --> 01:52:15.477
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

01:52:15.477 --> 01:52:18.317
requires to resubscribe each month.

01:52:18.317 --> 01:52:21.687
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

01:52:21.687 --> 01:52:23.717
or have to put Matt in cosplay

01:52:23.717 --> 01:52:26.487
to tell you that you can easily gift subscriptions

01:52:26.487 --> 01:52:28.957
to fellow critters if you're feeling generous.

01:52:28.957 --> 01:52:32.817
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

01:52:32.817 --> 01:52:34.857
shooting complicated parody promos

01:52:34.857 --> 01:52:37.827
feature Taliesin Jaffe as a vintage spooky boy

01:52:37.827 --> 01:52:40.177
in full monochromatic glory

01:52:40.177 --> 01:52:44.080
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub.

01:52:45.167 --> 01:52:49.307
But not today, no weird graphics,

01:52:49.307 --> 01:52:53.370
no puppet murder, no Sam Reigel.

01:52:57.127 --> 01:53:01.700
It's just me, here to say thank you,

01:53:03.197 --> 01:53:04.807
love you all, goodnight.

01:53:06.856 --> 01:53:09.939
(Marisha blows kiss)

02:06:56.721 --> 02:06:58.046
MATT: And welcome back.

02:06:58.046 --> 02:06:59.312
MARISHA: (softly) Fish sticks? What?

02:06:59.312 --> 02:07:02.401
MATT: So, Mighty Nein, gathering your things

02:07:02.401 --> 02:07:05.281
and preparing your final moments here in Zadash.

02:07:05.281 --> 02:07:07.891
As this experience is happening,

02:07:07.891 --> 02:07:11.411
Jester reaches out to Yussa and has a revelation,

02:07:11.411 --> 02:07:15.461
as a series of screams seem to be

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:17.414
the retort that she receives.

02:07:19.456 --> 02:07:20.921
ASHLEY: What's the matter?

02:07:20.921 --> 02:07:22.064
LAURA: He's with the city.

02:07:23.806 --> 02:07:24.897
TALIESIN: Is that what he--

02:07:24.897 --> 02:07:26.621
LAURA: I didn't hear him. I didn't hear anything.

02:07:26.621 --> 02:07:30.401
I just heard-- (sighs).
I just heard the screams.

02:07:30.401 --> 02:07:31.893
I just heard the city.

02:07:33.381 --> 02:07:34.521
MARISHA: All right, well.

02:07:34.521 --> 02:07:37.241
SAM: Is the screams just the city or is it all--?

02:07:37.241 --> 02:07:38.907
Where is it? The Abyss?
LAURA: I don't know what it is.

02:07:38.907 --> 02:07:40.639
It's the people living in the city, I don't know.

02:07:40.639 --> 02:07:41.547
MARISHA: The Astral Sea.

02:07:41.547 --> 02:07:42.380
SAM: The Astral Sea.

02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:45.041
Does all of the Astral Sea scream?

02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:46.841
MARISHA: Well, no, we've been there before.

02:07:48.311 --> 02:07:49.294
LIAM: Yeah.

02:07:50.994 --> 02:07:52.294
SAM: So he was in the city?

02:07:53.681 --> 02:07:55.481
LAURA: I don't know, he didn't answer me.

02:07:56.501 --> 02:07:59.434
SAM: Do we have anyone in Nicodranas who can go

02:07:59.434 --> 02:08:00.475
check on him?

02:08:00.475 --> 02:08:03.084
LIAM: You could ask his butler.
MARISHA: Wensforth.

02:08:03.084 --> 02:08:05.771
LAURA: I could, tomorrow.
LIAM: Tomorrow.

02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:07.891
LAURA: I have no more sending spells today.
MARISHA: Oh man.

02:08:07.891 --> 02:08:10.537
I guess, I mean, I can use a higher level.

02:08:10.537 --> 02:08:12.787
SAM: Wensforth? Wensforth.

02:08:12.787 --> 02:08:13.803
MARISHA: Wensworth?

02:08:14.851 --> 02:08:16.165
Forthwens.

02:08:16.165 --> 02:08:17.916
LIAM: You know what?

02:08:17.916 --> 02:08:18.799
Think about it.

02:08:18.799 --> 02:08:23.161
We are going to be going to sleep not too many hours away.

02:08:23.161 --> 02:08:26.301
Not much is going to change for Yussa

02:08:26.301 --> 02:08:28.941
between this moment and six hours from now.

02:08:28.941 --> 02:08:31.691
If he is either in real trouble--

02:08:31.691 --> 02:08:35.261
well, he's up shit's creek, yeah?

02:08:35.261 --> 02:08:39.376
So save it, and we go.

02:08:40.271 --> 02:08:42.651
And if you don't need it for anything else,

02:08:42.651 --> 02:08:44.975
you can conserve your power and then--

02:08:44.975 --> 02:08:47.350
LAURA: Use it before we go to sleep.
LIAM: And then do it. <i>Ja</i>.

02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:50.406
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:08:52.471 --> 02:08:56.011
He couldn't be separated from his body,

02:08:56.011 --> 02:08:58.251
the way that Molly was,

02:08:58.251 --> 02:09:01.711
and he's just trapped mentally in the city, could he?

02:09:01.711 --> 02:09:03.419
Could his body be broken and--

02:09:03.419 --> 02:09:06.391
LIAM: What do I know about that kind of thing?

02:09:06.391 --> 02:09:08.069
MATT: Make an arcana check.

02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:10.680
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's a "who fucking knows?"

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:11.636
MARISHA: Yeah, right.

02:09:11.636 --> 02:09:13.436
SAM: So many d20s.

02:09:14.333 --> 02:09:16.750
LIAM: I should've gone with
the one that just fell on my iPad.

02:09:17.901 --> 02:09:19.751
That is just a 16.

02:09:19.751 --> 02:09:20.584
MATT: 16?

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:25.223
LAURA: Veth rolled a 15 and she made a fluffernutter!

02:09:26.946 --> 02:09:27.887
LIAM: It's not too bad.

02:09:27.887 --> 02:09:31.341
MATT: You don't know too much of that scale of magic.

02:09:31.341 --> 02:09:33.961
Astral Projection and astral travel

02:09:33.961 --> 02:09:36.334
to that degree is extremely powerful magic.

02:09:38.051 --> 02:09:40.551
Especially to project one's spirit away from the body.

02:09:43.021 --> 02:09:45.321
You're not sure, really.

02:09:45.321 --> 02:09:48.301
You could go one way or the other.

02:09:48.301 --> 02:09:49.811
LIAM: What did the voices sound like?

02:09:49.811 --> 02:09:51.861
Can you do your best approximation of it?

02:09:54.309 --> 02:09:57.009
LAURA: (assorted screaming)

02:09:57.009 --> 02:09:59.171
Just a lot of that sort of thing.

02:09:59.171 --> 02:10:00.711
Nothing really saying anything.

02:10:00.711 --> 02:10:03.423
Just screaming, sounding tortured.

02:10:03.423 --> 02:10:04.814
TRAVIS: All unhappy screams--
LAURA: Pain.

02:10:04.814 --> 02:10:06.431
TRAVIS: --or some that are like,

02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:08.787
"Hey, oh, it's great in here!"

02:10:08.787 --> 02:10:10.979
LAURA: There could be one and it's just drowned out.

02:10:10.979 --> 02:10:13.481
You know-- I don't know.

02:10:13.481 --> 02:10:15.741
LIAM: It's like the sounds of Action Park.

02:10:15.741 --> 02:10:16.574
TRAVIS: I'm fine.

02:10:16.574 --> 02:10:17.882
Oh, my concussion.

02:10:20.090 --> 02:10:22.640
MATT: Somnovem's just a huge Beatles concert.

02:10:24.661 --> 02:10:27.981
LIAM: Hmm. And we have the last dream,

02:10:27.981 --> 02:10:31.781
which was screams of pain, fear, terror, agony.

02:10:31.781 --> 02:10:34.151
MARISHA: Lots of screaming.
LIAM: Good stuff, good stuff.

02:10:34.151 --> 02:10:36.371
All right, well, we have a plan.

02:10:36.371 --> 02:10:37.221
We'll stick to it.

02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:41.931
We will check with his friend.

02:10:41.931 --> 02:10:44.001
What do you have for me to get us to your home?

02:10:44.001 --> 02:10:49.001
TALIESIN: Oh, I remove the dragonfly cloth

02:10:49.711 --> 02:10:51.294
that runs through my armor.

02:10:53.303 --> 02:10:54.511
That ought to do it.

02:10:55.731 --> 02:10:56.991
LIAM: Is this room okay?

02:10:56.991 --> 02:11:01.321
Do you mind if we depart from in here?

02:11:01.321 --> 02:11:03.041
Can I draw on your floor?

02:11:03.041 --> 02:11:04.241
MATT: Couple of guys look at each other.

02:11:05.524 --> 02:11:07.182
"Yeah, I imagine there's all right."

02:11:08.025 --> 02:11:09.083
LIAM: Okay.

02:11:09.083 --> 02:11:11.331
MATT: "Do you need us to move the table out of the way?"

02:11:11.331 --> 02:11:14.091
LIAM: Ah, <i>ja</i>, that would be helpful, thank you.

02:11:14.091 --> 02:11:15.099
MATT: "You're welcome."

02:11:15.966 --> 02:11:17.841
(laughs)

02:11:17.841 --> 02:11:18.911
They're really out of their element

02:11:18.911 --> 02:11:22.010
in this whole hosting thing.

02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:23.701
(creaking) They move some tables

02:11:23.701 --> 02:11:25.117
out of the way.
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy

02:11:25.117 --> 02:11:27.861
to blow the dust on the ground

02:11:27.861 --> 02:11:30.053
away from the area that Caleb needs to draw on.

02:11:30.053 --> 02:11:32.871
MATT: It is a cloud.

02:11:32.871 --> 02:11:33.771
TRAVIS: Is it really dust, though,

02:11:33.771 --> 02:11:35.271
or is the grimy, sticky stuff

02:11:35.271 --> 02:11:37.955
on the bottom of the bar floor?
LAURA: That's still stuck?

02:11:37.955 --> 02:11:40.021
TRAVIS: Let's be honest.
We know what that floor is like.

02:11:40.021 --> 02:11:41.387
LIAM: Sticky alcohol floor.
TRAVIS: There's no dust.

02:11:41.387 --> 02:11:42.689
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:42.689 --> 02:11:44.005
LIAM: Some other things.

02:11:44.005 --> 02:11:45.689
TRAVIS: Just that Laffy Taffy.

02:11:45.689 --> 02:11:47.100
(laughter)

02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:49.586
TALIESIN: That's not sawdust.

02:11:49.586 --> 02:11:53.181
LIAM: Okay, so I put down a
little bit of old parchment of mine and

02:11:53.181 --> 02:11:56.183
I put the fabric that Caduceus has given me on top of it.

02:11:56.183 --> 02:12:00.391
And then I start to, with chalk, draw out from there,

02:12:00.391 --> 02:12:04.261
from the center, and I spend my five to 10 doing that

02:12:04.261 --> 02:12:06.271
and get to the very end.

02:12:06.271 --> 02:12:08.141
SAM: As you're doing that, if I may,

02:12:08.141 --> 02:12:10.813
Caduceus, can I just have a word with you?

02:12:10.813 --> 02:12:11.646
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:12:11.646 --> 02:12:12.931
SAM: Can I pull you aside for a second

02:12:12.931 --> 02:12:15.814
into one of these weird, stinky alcoves?

02:12:16.751 --> 02:12:19.301
Hey, I just want to say thank you again

02:12:19.301 --> 02:12:23.129
for saving my son's life yesterday.

02:12:24.563 --> 02:12:25.404
It was--

02:12:27.037 --> 02:12:30.164
I mean, it was everything to me, so thank you.

02:12:30.164 --> 02:12:31.671
TALIESIN: It was the least we can do.

02:12:31.671 --> 02:12:34.251
You've raised a good kid, by the way.

02:12:34.251 --> 02:12:38.904
SAM: Yeah. No, yeah, he's great.

02:12:40.791 --> 02:12:44.281
I want to-- I feel like I owe you for this

02:12:44.281 --> 02:12:49.281
and I want to come help you with whatever you're doing here.

02:12:49.483 --> 02:12:52.634
But also, I kind of want to stay.

02:12:53.621 --> 02:12:56.304
And so I thought I'd ask your advice.

02:12:57.881 --> 02:12:59.745
What you think I should do.

02:12:59.745 --> 02:13:02.495
TALIESIN: (exhales)

02:13:06.491 --> 02:13:08.308
What's your biggest fear?

02:13:13.087 --> 02:13:15.348
SAM: I would say it's not coming back, but

02:13:17.306 --> 02:13:18.440
that's not it.
TALIESIN: But why?

02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:19.761
SAM: It's not it.

02:13:19.761 --> 02:13:22.181
I think my biggest fear is for him,

02:13:22.181 --> 02:13:23.772
for Luc to...

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.747
expect me to leave.

02:13:31.701 --> 02:13:35.961
TALIESIN: Well, any advice I have in that direction

02:13:35.961 --> 02:13:39.858
is obviously going to be a bit thin.

02:13:39.858 --> 02:13:42.301
I'm not a parent.

02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:43.561
I was a child once, though.

02:13:43.561 --> 02:13:45.564
So I have experience in that direction.

02:13:49.931 --> 02:13:53.817
Every parent eventually leaves one way or another.

02:13:55.561 --> 02:13:59.891
And I suppose there's nothing you can do

02:14:01.381 --> 02:14:03.131
for a child to protect them

02:14:04.291 --> 02:14:06.171
from what the world will eventually do to them.

02:14:06.171 --> 02:14:08.031
I certainly can't imagine this is

02:14:08.031 --> 02:14:10.244
what my parents really wanted for me.

02:14:11.711 --> 02:14:16.286
But they allowed me

02:14:16.286 --> 02:14:18.951
to do this.

02:14:18.951 --> 02:14:23.641
They built me to do this and to be happy doing this.

02:14:23.641 --> 02:14:27.904
My happiness has occasionally wavered, but it's held.

02:14:29.341 --> 02:14:32.364
And I feel like you've instilled that in your son.

02:14:33.881 --> 02:14:37.031
The dark times are going to come

02:14:37.031 --> 02:14:39.201
and maybe you'll be there and maybe you won't.

02:14:39.201 --> 02:14:41.461
You're working hard to make

02:14:41.461 --> 02:14:43.701
as few of them happen as possible.

02:14:43.701 --> 02:14:47.851
But I don't fear for

02:14:47.851 --> 02:14:50.481
his happiness in the long run.

02:14:50.481 --> 02:14:51.722
Well done.

02:14:54.221 --> 02:14:55.934
SAM: And what about mine?

02:14:56.911 --> 02:14:57.994
Do I care?

02:14:59.786 --> 02:15:02.497
TALIESIN: I don't know.
I think your parents really messed you up.

02:15:02.497 --> 02:15:05.330
(laughter)

02:15:11.241 --> 02:15:14.296
TALIESIN: I don't know, I don't know.

02:15:14.296 --> 02:15:18.389
SAM: Do you need me right now?

02:15:18.389 --> 02:15:19.530
TALIESIN: I do,

02:15:22.072 --> 02:15:23.455
for what it's worth.

02:15:25.271 --> 02:15:26.104
But

02:15:27.604 --> 02:15:31.012
I think we all need each other's happiness also.

02:15:32.049 --> 02:15:33.616
So that's important.

02:15:35.851 --> 02:15:39.554
No one of us is here to sacrifice for the others, really.

02:15:40.731 --> 02:15:42.634
We all have to be in it together.

02:15:45.621 --> 02:15:48.894
I can't even imagine what you're going through.

02:15:50.399 --> 02:15:51.751
SAM: Well, it's much better

02:15:51.751 --> 02:15:54.048
than it could have been without you.

02:15:54.048 --> 02:15:55.611
TALIESIN: I appreciate that, but...

02:15:59.761 --> 02:16:03.851
genuinely, I can't imagine how much it is

02:16:03.851 --> 02:16:05.124
and what a burden it is.

02:16:06.171 --> 02:16:09.214
And how much you sacrifice is-- everyone knows.

02:16:10.741 --> 02:16:12.971
More than others, I think,

02:16:12.971 --> 02:16:15.361
although I wouldn't say that out loud to everybody else.

02:16:15.361 --> 02:16:16.721
SAM: I'll tell them.

02:16:16.721 --> 02:16:17.554
TALIESIN: I figured.

02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:20.604
SAM: Okay.

02:16:22.701 --> 02:16:25.091
TALIESIN: I need an end to this, too.

02:16:25.091 --> 02:16:27.984
But I don't think it's here yet and I'm hoping to see it.

02:16:30.871 --> 02:16:33.051
SAM: Well, I needed you yesterday

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:35.434
and you need me today and I guess that's it.

02:16:36.561 --> 02:16:39.344
TALIESIN: For the record, when this is over,

02:16:40.927 --> 02:16:41.794
it's no debt.

02:16:41.794 --> 02:16:43.711
We're always here for each other.

02:16:43.711 --> 02:16:46.161
Even if we're not in the middle of it.

02:16:46.161 --> 02:16:49.941
Happy to do it again a year from now, a decade from now.

02:16:49.941 --> 02:16:52.181
Whenever, I'll be there.

02:16:52.181 --> 02:16:56.941
SAM: Thanks, I appreciate it, Mr. Clay.

02:16:56.941 --> 02:16:58.511
TALIESIN: Try not to blow me up again.

02:16:58.511 --> 02:16:59.902
That would be nice, too.

02:16:59.902 --> 02:17:02.335
SAM: Sure.
TALIESIN: That's what I'll ask.

02:17:02.335 --> 02:17:06.371
SAM: Okay. I'll aim for somebody else.

02:17:06.371 --> 02:17:07.971
TALIESIN: Fjord's looking flammable.

02:17:07.971 --> 02:17:08.804
SAM: He always does.

02:17:08.804 --> 02:17:09.979
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah.

02:17:11.911 --> 02:17:13.994
TALIESIN: Thank you, I appreciate it.

02:17:14.911 --> 02:17:18.001
SAM: All right. Caleb, you almost done?

02:17:18.001 --> 02:17:21.421
LIAM: Yeah, are all the Brenattos here right now?

02:17:21.421 --> 02:17:22.334
SAM: Is he asleep?

02:17:23.221 --> 02:17:25.171
MATT: They're present, I'd say, yeah.

02:17:25.171 --> 02:17:27.734
Luc is a little sleepy eyed, but.

02:17:28.921 --> 02:17:32.311
LIAM: All right, well, when I near the last few strokes

02:17:32.311 --> 02:17:34.214
of the sigils on the ground in chalk.

02:17:35.941 --> 02:17:36.774
Luc?

02:17:38.566 --> 02:17:40.674
MATT: "Yeah?"
LIAM: Come a little closer.

02:17:41.511 --> 02:17:43.411
So we are going to go again,

02:17:43.411 --> 02:17:47.172
but when we come back, we would very much like to stay.

02:17:49.171 --> 02:17:53.737
In the meantime, thank you for lending us your mother.

02:17:55.181 --> 02:17:58.916
We need her to keep an eye on us.

02:17:59.991 --> 02:18:01.364
MATT: "Yeah, she's strong."

02:18:04.201 --> 02:18:05.568
LIAM: And don't worry.

02:18:06.471 --> 02:18:10.257
I look over his shoulder at his father.

02:18:12.041 --> 02:18:13.933
We'll keep an eye on her, too.

02:18:16.311 --> 02:18:17.144
MATT: (as Yeza) "I trust."

02:18:23.553 --> 02:18:27.913
SAM: Don't do any dangerous experiments while I'm gone.

02:18:27.913 --> 02:18:29.501
MATT: "I wouldn't think of it.

02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:31.441
"I only get to do those with you."

02:18:31.441 --> 02:18:32.274
SAM: Yeah.

02:18:35.051 --> 02:18:36.254
And keep him close.

02:18:38.691 --> 02:18:40.291
Don't let him out of your sight.

02:18:41.281 --> 02:18:42.281
MATT: "I don't intend to."

02:18:45.151 --> 02:18:50.151
SAM: And take this potion, just in case.

02:18:50.238 --> 02:18:55.161
I don't know what could happen, but just take it.

02:18:55.161 --> 02:18:57.061
MATT: "Honey, I think you're probably going to need that

02:18:57.061 --> 02:18:59.694
"more than I would, if we're staying in here."

02:19:04.021 --> 02:19:05.259
SAM: I hope not.

02:19:05.259 --> 02:19:08.551
MATT: "I hope not, either, but you made us both a promise."

02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:11.974
SAM: Okay.

02:19:14.401 --> 02:19:16.542
MATT: "You promised."

02:19:16.542 --> 02:19:17.817
SAM: It's a promise.

02:19:19.681 --> 02:19:21.952
I'll be back real soon.

02:19:25.372 --> 02:19:30.144
And then whatever you want to do for the rest of your life.

02:19:32.531 --> 02:19:34.331
MATT: "Well, I should start thinking now, then."

02:19:34.331 --> 02:19:35.164
SAM: Yes.

02:19:37.291 --> 02:19:38.171
MATT: "We'll get on it.

02:19:38.171 --> 02:19:40.201
"I'll have Luc help me with some ideas."

02:19:40.201 --> 02:19:42.251
(as Luc) "What?"
(as Yeza) "Don't worry about it now."

02:19:43.974 --> 02:19:46.021
SAM: All right.
LIAM: You ready?

02:19:46.021 --> 02:19:47.504
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

02:19:49.251 --> 02:19:50.709
MARISHA: Jes, are you ready?

02:19:53.359 --> 02:19:55.541
LAURA: I'm going to just run up the stairs really fast

02:19:55.541 --> 02:19:58.651
and put my hand on the door.

02:19:58.651 --> 02:20:00.841
I'm not going to knock or anything.

02:20:00.841 --> 02:20:01.674
MATT: Okay.

02:20:03.271 --> 02:20:05.234
You hear low voices, conversation.

02:20:11.284 --> 02:20:12.561
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:12.561 --> 02:20:14.228
And I'll come back down.

02:20:16.139 --> 02:20:17.220
LIAM: Yeah?

02:20:20.296 --> 02:20:25.296
Okay, <i>auf Wiedersehen.</i> (whooshing).

02:20:26.694 --> 02:20:30.011
MATT: (whooshing) You all, one by one,

02:20:30.011 --> 02:20:32.254
go running into teleportion chamber to--?

02:20:33.461 --> 02:20:35.081
SAM: Oh, shit, he forgot to pick a destination!

02:20:35.081 --> 02:20:35.914
We're done!

02:20:37.337 --> 02:20:40.071
TRAVIS: (tearing apart)
SAM and ASHLEY: (screaming)

02:20:40.071 --> 02:20:43.304
MATT: Correct, so this is teleport spell, not the circle.

02:20:46.241 --> 02:20:47.074
You all--
LIAM: I don't need it, right.

02:20:47.074 --> 02:20:49.141
I can just go.
MATT: Yeah, there's no circle.

02:20:49.141 --> 02:20:50.371
SAM: That's just for flair.
LIAM: Just for flair.

02:20:50.371 --> 02:20:52.771
MATT: Yeah, there's still a casting process to it.

02:20:52.771 --> 02:20:53.971
Still a casting process.

02:20:55.501 --> 02:20:58.568
TRAVIS: "You wrote on our floor."

02:20:58.568 --> 02:20:59.923
MARISHA: It's a curse.

02:20:59.923 --> 02:21:01.371
TALIESIN: It's just a circle of dicks.

02:21:01.371 --> 02:21:02.204
MARISHA and MATT: Yeah.

02:21:03.641 --> 02:21:04.651
MATT: There's a brief moment after you all leave

02:21:04.651 --> 02:21:07.470
and one of the guys, like, "He didn't even use the circle."

02:21:07.470 --> 02:21:10.361
(laughter)

02:21:10.361 --> 02:21:11.569
Smash cut to--

02:21:11.569 --> 02:21:13.264
TALIESIN: Banksy. Boom!
MARISHA: Hopscotch squares.

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:15.301
(laughter)

02:21:15.301 --> 02:21:16.801
A game of Four Square for them.

02:21:17.811 --> 02:21:21.341
MATT: You all set foot on a soft, mossy,

02:21:21.341 --> 02:21:24.494
grass-covered and earthen ground

02:21:25.541 --> 02:21:30.041
as you emerge from wherever
this arcane sudden surge brought you

02:21:31.308 --> 02:21:35.357
into the shaded center of the Blooming Grove.

02:21:35.357 --> 02:21:38.821
You see yourself surrounded by the dense canopy

02:21:38.821 --> 02:21:40.293
of the Savalirwood.

02:21:40.293 --> 02:21:42.971
The sky above, a dense gray color

02:21:42.971 --> 02:21:45.431
with a gentle rain that is falling

02:21:45.431 --> 02:21:49.011
and immediately beginning to soak coldly through you.

02:21:49.011 --> 02:21:49.931
Wind blowing a bit.

02:21:49.931 --> 02:21:51.721
That storm that you saw coming

02:21:51.721 --> 02:21:53.831
seems to have begun to set in

02:21:53.831 --> 02:21:55.654
this far north of where you were.

02:21:57.041 --> 02:21:58.571
Looking around you, you can see

02:21:58.571 --> 02:22:02.231
the exterior of the Blooming Grove.

02:22:02.231 --> 02:22:03.581
When you first arrived, you could see

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:04.761
the Savalirwood's corruption

02:22:04.761 --> 02:22:06.921
was beginning to encroach upon the grounds.

02:22:06.921 --> 02:22:11.551
It had bypassed the exterior stonework and fencing.

02:22:11.551 --> 02:22:13.561
But now, as you glance about with the light

02:22:13.561 --> 02:22:18.561
that you still have, you can see that it has blossomed.

02:22:18.761 --> 02:22:22.431
Thick, uncut grass rises up bright green.

02:22:22.431 --> 02:22:25.621
Flowers and other roots all begin to intertwine

02:22:25.621 --> 02:22:28.641
as ivy now grows over the iron fences.

02:22:28.641 --> 02:22:33.281
Beyond that, you can see a number of these odd,

02:22:33.281 --> 02:22:37.881
if beautiful, purple crystal structures.

02:22:37.881 --> 02:22:40.601
These almost tree-like, twisting pillars

02:22:40.601 --> 02:22:43.490
of natural, purple crystal

02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:47.354
that sit at the perimeter of the grounds.

02:22:49.501 --> 02:22:53.776
They ever so faintly thrum with a faint light.

02:22:53.776 --> 02:22:57.434
(thrumming)

02:23:00.323 --> 02:23:05.323
LAURA: Caduceus, this is beautiful!

02:23:05.361 --> 02:23:06.536
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:23:06.536 --> 02:23:10.560
Oh, it's your first times.

02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:12.062
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:23:12.062 --> 02:23:14.311
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:23:14.311 --> 02:23:15.310
Yasha's too.

02:23:15.310 --> 02:23:16.909
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

02:23:16.909 --> 02:23:19.334
LAURA: (giggles) You grew up here?

02:23:20.316 --> 02:23:22.616
This isn't at all how I pictured the cemetery.

02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:26.341
MARISHA: It looks a lot healthier.

02:23:26.341 --> 02:23:28.186
TRAVIS: The crystals are natural?

02:23:28.186 --> 02:23:29.509
That's supposed to happen?

02:23:29.509 --> 02:23:32.431
TALIESIN: Well, it depends on your definition of natural.

02:23:32.431 --> 02:23:33.881
LIAM: A little different than how we left it, though.

02:23:33.881 --> 02:23:35.694
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: Caduceus--

02:23:35.694 --> 02:23:37.176
TALIESIN: This is the way it was described to me

02:23:37.176 --> 02:23:38.981
when I was younger.

02:23:38.981 --> 02:23:43.981
ASHLEY: Am I allowed to pick a flower?

02:23:44.290 --> 02:23:46.651
Or do I have to leave them here?

02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:48.143
TALIESIN: There are rules.

02:23:48.143 --> 02:23:49.209
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:23:50.061 --> 02:23:51.221
TALIESIN: You have to read the name.

02:23:51.221 --> 02:23:52.434
There'll be a stone.

02:23:54.381 --> 02:23:57.181
You'll have to read the name, think about them,

02:23:57.181 --> 02:24:00.057
ask permission, and there has to be more than one bloom.

02:24:00.057 --> 02:24:02.191
So that one bloom is always there.

02:24:02.191 --> 02:24:03.641
And don't take more than one.

02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:07.256
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: And if you get a weird vibe--

02:24:07.256 --> 02:24:08.506
ASHLEY: Leave it.
TALIESIN: --don't pick it.

02:24:09.841 --> 02:24:11.161
ASHLEY: I'll wait a little bit, then.

02:24:11.161 --> 02:24:14.911
TALIESIN: I can show you where my family flowers are, too.

02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:15.760
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:17.341
TALIESIN: But you'll know if you're not supposed to.

02:24:17.341 --> 02:24:18.831
I don't worry.

02:24:18.831 --> 02:24:19.664
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:24:21.161 --> 02:24:23.231
MATT: While it is still mid-afternoon-ish,

02:24:23.231 --> 02:24:27.561
the darker storm cover that's blowing in

02:24:29.171 --> 02:24:30.921
tends to shade the atmosphere.

02:24:30.921 --> 02:24:34.751
And you can see the faint, warm glow from a window

02:24:34.751 --> 02:24:38.231
from the the Clay abode that sits

02:24:38.231 --> 02:24:40.991
near the center of the grove itself.

02:24:40.991 --> 02:24:43.891
You can see a bit of smoke coming out through the chimney.

02:24:45.371 --> 02:24:49.211
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk to the temple

02:24:49.211 --> 02:24:51.984
and knock on the door.

02:24:53.802 --> 02:24:57.231
(knocking)

02:24:57.231 --> 02:24:59.347
MATT: The door, you hear shifting of metal.

02:24:59.347 --> 02:25:03.101
(metal sliding, door creaking)

02:25:03.101 --> 02:25:04.441
And there, on the other side of the door,

02:25:04.441 --> 02:25:08.241
peeking through the warm, candlelit glow,

02:25:08.241 --> 02:25:13.241
from the interior, you see Constance Clay,

02:25:13.449 --> 02:25:14.941
Caduceus' mother peeks out.

02:25:16.631 --> 02:25:17.806
TALIESIN: Hey, Mom.

02:25:17.806 --> 02:25:19.971
MATT: "Caduceus."

02:25:19.971 --> 02:25:22.411
TALIESIN: I have friends with me.

02:25:22.411 --> 02:25:24.341
MATT: "My goodness. Come here."

02:25:24.341 --> 02:25:26.631
She opens the door and just gives him a big hug.

02:25:26.631 --> 02:25:28.531
TALIESIN: I should take-- okay, oh.

02:25:28.531 --> 02:25:29.811
MATT: Pulls back a bit.

02:25:29.811 --> 02:25:30.874
TALIESIN: I'll take this off.

02:25:31.821 --> 02:25:33.741
MATT: "My, my, my, you're all getting soaked.

02:25:33.741 --> 02:25:36.014
"Come in, come in, quickly.

02:25:37.561 --> 02:25:39.541
"I'm so happy to see you.

02:25:39.541 --> 02:25:40.614
"Come, come, come.

02:25:41.941 --> 02:25:43.441
"We need to make some more tea."

02:25:46.531 --> 02:25:48.797
TALIESIN: I'll start taking off the layers

02:25:48.797 --> 02:25:51.971
of armor and ridiculous.

02:25:51.971 --> 02:25:54.561
And just take off anything that's wet

02:25:54.561 --> 02:25:57.034
and put it in the corner by the fire.

02:25:58.271 --> 02:26:00.401
MATT: You all enter the beautiful interior of the temple.

02:26:00.401 --> 02:26:04.201
It's simple, but very well kept.

02:26:04.201 --> 02:26:05.625
The interior has a very

02:26:06.692 --> 02:26:10.571
wet earth and herb scent to it.

02:26:10.571 --> 02:26:12.441
It almost seems to change by the moment

02:26:12.441 --> 02:26:14.351
as you sit in there with the breeze that comes

02:26:14.351 --> 02:26:16.621
through the distant windows that are currently open

02:26:16.621 --> 02:26:19.231
to let that fresh rain smell mingle

02:26:19.231 --> 02:26:20.531
and push through the various scents.

02:26:20.531 --> 02:26:23.621
And you can see dried herbs and dried flowers

02:26:23.621 --> 02:26:25.741
and other things that have been hung.

02:26:25.741 --> 02:26:28.941
Some that look to be in almost ceremonial wreaths.

02:26:28.941 --> 02:26:30.731
Some that might be being prepared

02:26:30.731 --> 02:26:32.784
for other things like steeping.

02:26:34.681 --> 02:26:36.941
You can see all sorts of lanterns

02:26:36.941 --> 02:26:41.241
that are gently flickering throughout the interior chamber.

02:26:41.241 --> 02:26:45.921
Very simple furniture, probably long ago crafted

02:26:45.921 --> 02:26:48.124
from some of the trees nearby.

02:26:49.161 --> 02:26:54.154
Carpentry may have been a trade of a Clay before his time.

02:26:55.701 --> 02:26:57.291
And within a very, very short period of time,

02:26:57.291 --> 02:27:00.251
you hear other footsteps beginning to approach

02:27:00.251 --> 02:27:02.141
and a few other figures arrive.

02:27:02.141 --> 02:27:04.082
You can see Clarabelle,

02:27:04.082 --> 02:27:08.280
your younger sister.

02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:10.201
Actually, no, that's your older sister.

02:27:10.201 --> 02:27:11.721
Comes out and glances.

02:27:11.721 --> 02:27:12.687
He's got a lot of siblings.

02:27:12.687 --> 02:27:13.576
TALIESIN: I do,

02:27:13.576 --> 02:27:15.194
and they all have the same name.

02:27:15.194 --> 02:27:16.421
(laughter)

02:27:16.421 --> 02:27:19.431
MATT: Glances out. "Caduceus."

02:27:19.431 --> 02:27:20.722
TALIESIN: Hey.

02:27:20.722 --> 02:27:21.555
MATT: "Hi."

02:27:22.561 --> 02:27:24.171
TALIESIN: You look shorter.

02:27:24.171 --> 02:27:25.435
MATT: "You look wetter."

02:27:25.435 --> 02:27:27.591
TALIESIN: (laughs)

02:27:27.591 --> 02:27:30.094
MATT: She comes up and it gives you a clap on the shoulder.

02:27:31.671 --> 02:27:36.671
Behind that, you see Caduceus' father, Cornelius,

02:27:36.771 --> 02:27:39.491
steps out from behind and he has what looks to be

02:27:40.348 --> 02:27:44.264
a cup of some sort of hot, steaming liquid.

02:27:45.251 --> 02:27:48.161
"Oh, Caduceus, I didn't know you were coming.

02:27:48.161 --> 02:27:49.428
"All right."

02:27:49.428 --> 02:27:50.494
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:51.931
TALIESIN: A bit short notice.

02:27:51.931 --> 02:27:54.251
Things have been moving kind of quickly.

02:27:54.251 --> 02:27:56.071
MATT: "I can imagine.

02:27:56.071 --> 02:27:58.841
"I mean, we sensed you'd find your way here soon,

02:27:58.841 --> 02:28:01.181
"but maybe just not quite this soon."

02:28:01.181 --> 02:28:03.861
TALIESIN: Well.
MATT: "Tea, everybody?"

02:28:03.861 --> 02:28:04.954
MARISHA: Yes.
LAURA: Yes, please.

02:28:04.954 --> 02:28:05.851
ASHLEY: I'll have some.
SAM: Sure.

02:28:05.851 --> 02:28:07.011
MATT: "I'll get to that, right now.

02:28:07.011 --> 02:28:08.211
"Don't worry about it."
TALIESIN: Thanks, dad.

02:28:08.211 --> 02:28:09.731
MATT: "Dry off a bit."

02:28:09.731 --> 02:28:12.741
He turns back and as he curves

02:28:12.741 --> 02:28:15.881
around the corner to head to a back chamber,

02:28:15.881 --> 02:28:20.234
you see Calliope just peeking around the edge.

02:28:21.111 --> 02:28:23.261
She still has the hat on that you gave her.

02:28:27.391 --> 02:28:29.176
Takes the hat off, hides it.

02:28:32.794 --> 02:28:34.734
And then leaves the room.

02:28:37.691 --> 02:28:39.491
TALIESIN: It's good to see she's doing well.

02:28:40.626 --> 02:28:45.611
MATT: "Well," Constance says, "doing as well as we can.

02:28:48.151 --> 02:28:51.981
"Sleepless, or at least restless nights as of late."

02:28:51.981 --> 02:28:53.381
TALIESIN: Me as well.

02:28:54.471 --> 02:28:56.571
We have a lot to discuss.

02:28:56.571 --> 02:29:00.381
Where's Colton, where's Corrin, where's Aunt?

02:29:00.381 --> 02:29:03.461
MATT: "Colton and Corrin are actually out

02:29:03.461 --> 02:29:06.471
"doing a trade run to Shadycreek.

02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:09.091
"Likely to be back in probably the next couple of days,

02:29:09.091 --> 02:29:10.144
"two to three days, but

02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:14.977
"I'm sorry that they weren't here to greet you."

02:29:16.128 --> 02:29:18.631
TALIESIN: That's okay.

02:29:18.631 --> 02:29:20.191
I'm just glad to see anybody here,

02:29:20.191 --> 02:29:22.149
and to be honest, it's--

02:29:23.182 --> 02:29:27.076
I've never seen this place looking so good, so healthy.

02:29:27.076 --> 02:29:30.271
MATT: "Us either in some time.

02:29:30.271 --> 02:29:33.126
"That's thanks to all of you."

02:29:34.411 --> 02:29:38.681
TALIESIN: Well, things are afoot.

02:29:40.565 --> 02:29:42.121
I suppose.

02:29:42.121 --> 02:29:44.021
Instead of, again--

02:29:45.612 --> 02:29:50.482
I'm going to cast Exposition at 3rd-level.

02:29:50.482 --> 02:29:52.069
I'm going to cast Exposition at 3rd-level.

02:29:52.069 --> 02:29:53.169
MATT: Okay.

02:29:55.021 --> 02:29:56.071
MARISHA: Counterspell.

02:29:56.071 --> 02:29:57.371
TALIESIN: (laughs) Shit!

02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:00.013
Dick!

02:30:01.991 --> 02:30:05.511
MATT: As the family that's present begins to close in

02:30:05.511 --> 02:30:10.483
as you tell this tale and this impromptu story circle

02:30:10.483 --> 02:30:14.896
begins to build out of the space
in the entryway of this temple.

02:30:17.411 --> 02:30:22.201
With each additional stage of danger that is discussed

02:30:22.201 --> 02:30:24.279
about the city,

02:30:24.279 --> 02:30:28.146
about the visions that you've had,

02:30:28.146 --> 02:30:31.663
there is a noticeable shift in tone.

02:30:35.711 --> 02:30:39.294
Constance, looking at the rest and making eye contact says,

02:30:43.361 --> 02:30:45.351
"A number of us have been having visions

02:30:45.351 --> 02:30:47.622
"in our meditations and dreams.

02:30:49.606 --> 02:30:52.143
"The comfort of the Wild Mother sometimes

02:30:54.421 --> 02:30:57.789
"coming with an undercurrent of warning.

02:31:01.381 --> 02:31:05.241
"Anxiety, dread, anticipation

02:31:05.241 --> 02:31:09.851
"of something unknown just over the horizon.

02:31:09.851 --> 02:31:12.444
"That question, like something lurking in the shadows

02:31:12.444 --> 02:31:15.077
"That question, like something lurking in the shadows

02:31:15.077 --> 02:31:17.417
"beyond your sight in the forest.

02:31:19.951 --> 02:31:24.567
"We haven't been able to place it, but--

02:31:27.076 --> 02:31:28.384
"(sighs)

02:31:28.384 --> 02:31:30.415
"It's an odd feeling, like,

02:31:31.591 --> 02:31:34.161
"like every time the sun set,

02:31:34.161 --> 02:31:37.241
"we were watching it set for the last time.

02:31:37.241 --> 02:31:38.791
"Does that make sense, Caduceus?"

02:31:39.941 --> 02:31:44.351
TALIESIN: Yes, yes, it does.

02:31:45.594 --> 02:31:46.427
I--

02:31:50.595 --> 02:31:55.071
I don't want to infer too much because things have been

02:31:55.071 --> 02:31:59.922
so strange and so unexpected.

02:32:00.851 --> 02:32:01.686
But...

02:32:04.036 --> 02:32:06.494
I fear for everything.

02:32:09.361 --> 02:32:13.151
I've had dreams of this place

02:32:15.141 --> 02:32:19.364
touched by such--

02:32:21.571 --> 02:32:24.871
I hate to even use the word evil.

02:32:26.587 --> 02:32:28.070
Malformed.

02:32:32.731 --> 02:32:34.066
I was--

02:32:34.066 --> 02:32:36.233
You trained me against to--

02:32:38.133 --> 02:32:39.971
to protect this place from the undead

02:32:39.971 --> 02:32:44.281
and from the perversion of death.

02:32:44.281 --> 02:32:47.834
But I have seen--

02:32:50.561 --> 02:32:55.308
I have seen life twisted in terrible ways that

02:32:58.567 --> 02:33:01.117
make any death seem like a mercy.

02:33:03.516 --> 02:33:04.349
It's--

02:33:08.331 --> 02:33:09.786
It's a lot out there.

02:33:13.846 --> 02:33:17.521
MATT: You see Cornelius is going around
refilling everyone's tea and goes,

02:33:18.641 --> 02:33:21.774
"Well, Caduceus, that's, um,

02:33:24.799 --> 02:33:26.374
"unsettling.

02:33:33.701 --> 02:33:36.894
"Calliope, do you want to talk to your brother?"

02:33:39.051 --> 02:33:41.094
Calliope comes forward and sits down.

02:33:47.011 --> 02:33:48.901
"I don't know how to describe it necessarily,

02:33:48.901 --> 02:33:50.761
"but we've all had these

02:33:50.761 --> 02:33:55.704
"desperate-- disparate thoughts and feelings.

02:34:01.071 --> 02:34:03.434
"It feels like it has some connection to you.

02:34:10.318 --> 02:34:15.318
"And if this vision that you had,

02:34:15.544 --> 02:34:18.441
"this terrible thing that you're all

02:34:18.441 --> 02:34:21.646
"making your way north to deal with,

02:34:26.461 --> 02:34:30.511
"if that's the connection that I'm feeling so strong here,

02:34:30.511 --> 02:34:32.228
"then I don't want you to go."

02:34:36.531 --> 02:34:37.681
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:34:39.271 --> 02:34:40.562
(sighs)

02:34:44.411 --> 02:34:45.244
I know.

02:34:47.893 --> 02:34:49.393
MATT: "Like, you-- you've-- you--"

02:34:50.321 --> 02:34:53.598
You see, Constance goes, "Please, my--"

02:34:53.598 --> 02:34:56.141
She says, (as Calliope) "No, no, no, let me talk.

02:34:56.141 --> 02:34:57.824
"All right, you've done your thing.

02:35:00.971 --> 02:35:04.005
"You went out. You followed the Wild Mother's visions.

02:35:04.005 --> 02:35:08.999
"You put together the salvation of our grove.

02:35:08.999 --> 02:35:10.374
"You put together the salvation of our grove.

02:35:12.331 --> 02:35:13.689
"Right? Like, you--

02:35:16.374 --> 02:35:18.851
"Why don't you just come back home?

02:35:18.851 --> 02:35:19.684
"Stay here.

02:35:23.551 --> 02:35:27.604
"Respectfully, let these folk deal with the problem."

02:35:32.501 --> 02:35:37.492
TALIESIN: Is Constance making a face about this?

02:35:37.492 --> 02:35:38.325
MATT: Yeah.

02:35:39.271 --> 02:35:40.821
TALIESIN: Where is it at?

02:35:44.726 --> 02:35:47.851
MATT: That maternal...

02:35:49.509 --> 02:35:51.142
worry for you.

02:35:53.089 --> 02:35:58.084
But also kind of knowing your answer.

02:36:01.016 --> 02:36:02.758
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to go outside.

02:36:06.656 --> 02:36:08.076
MATT: Okay.

02:36:08.076 --> 02:36:09.219
TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the--

02:36:10.086 --> 02:36:11.396
I'm going to go to the

02:36:13.096 --> 02:36:15.619
spring and sit by the spring for a second.

02:36:17.306 --> 02:36:19.046
LIAM: It's a lovely home you have here.

02:36:19.046 --> 02:36:22.466
MARISHA: Yeah, the tea is very nice. (clears throat)

02:36:22.466 --> 02:36:24.348
MATT: (as Cornelius) "Well, thank you very much."
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:36:24.348 --> 02:36:26.952
MATT: "There's certainly more where that came from.

02:36:28.776 --> 02:36:32.166
"I can go ahead and settle some more plates for dinner.

02:36:32.166 --> 02:36:33.976
"We've got all manner of

02:36:34.996 --> 02:36:37.236
"mash tubers and--"

02:36:37.236 --> 02:36:40.528
LAURA: Ooh, yum.
SAM: All manner of tubers?

02:36:40.528 --> 02:36:43.691
MATT: "Well, we have three different
types here I can prepare."

02:36:43.691 --> 02:36:46.349
SAM: That's a lot of tubers.
LAURA: Oh, do you have the golden tubers?

02:36:47.226 --> 02:36:48.186
MATT: "Don't know if I do."

02:36:48.186 --> 02:36:49.449
LAURA: Yellow tubers?

02:36:50.436 --> 02:36:51.906
MATT: "Yellow."
LAURA: Yellow?

02:36:51.906 --> 02:36:53.911
MATT: "Yeah."
LAURA: Yeah. Those sound good.

02:36:53.911 --> 02:36:55.728
LIAM: Those are good.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:36:55.728 --> 02:36:57.306
LIAM: I ate those growing up.

02:36:57.306 --> 02:37:00.516
LAURA: I'm going to pull out some of my baked goods

02:37:00.516 --> 02:37:02.406
that I bought on our last shopping spree

02:37:02.406 --> 02:37:06.126
and just sit them out on a plate for everyone.

02:37:06.126 --> 02:37:09.299
Sorry, I touched them, but they're pretty yummy.

02:37:10.306 --> 02:37:13.219
MARISHA: Here, Cornelius, let me help you get some plates.

02:37:14.806 --> 02:37:17.496
MATT: You see they're all looking a bit perturbed

02:37:17.496 --> 02:37:19.716
with Caduceus's exit.

02:37:19.716 --> 02:37:21.539
MARISHA: Perturbed, like irritated?

02:37:22.779 --> 02:37:24.136
TRAVIS: Flummoxed.
MARISHA: Flummoxed?

02:37:24.136 --> 02:37:26.051
LIAM: Tubered?
MARISHA: Tubered.

02:37:30.886 --> 02:37:35.406
MATT: Constance begins to make some little conversation

02:37:35.406 --> 02:37:40.049
while Calliope gets up and leaves after Caduceus.

02:37:42.556 --> 02:37:44.116
Now you're out there by the spring,

02:37:44.116 --> 02:37:45.946
and the rain is starting to really come down now

02:37:45.946 --> 02:37:47.896
as the light to the afternoon begins to

02:37:49.756 --> 02:37:52.939
slowly climb towards the end of day.

02:37:57.456 --> 02:38:00.816
You hear in the distance (thunder rumbling).

02:38:00.816 --> 02:38:02.159
You see the distant flash.

02:38:04.286 --> 02:38:05.363
TALIESIN: I'm just going to

02:38:06.746 --> 02:38:07.756
stare at the--

02:38:10.036 --> 02:38:12.319
oh, lilies in the pond.

02:38:12.319 --> 02:38:13.872
I'm just going to--

02:38:17.089 --> 02:38:18.939
I am not ready to go back in there.

02:38:21.946 --> 02:38:24.226
MATT: You hear the gentle footsteps,

02:38:24.226 --> 02:38:27.499
wet footsteps of someone approaching.

02:38:35.346 --> 02:38:36.656
(as Calliope) "Look, I'm just being honest.

02:38:36.656 --> 02:38:39.666
"It doesn't mean I expect you to listen to me."

02:38:39.666 --> 02:38:41.058
TALIESIN: If you're going to talk, sit.

02:38:42.996 --> 02:38:43.829
MATT: "Fine."

02:38:46.566 --> 02:38:47.993
She plops down next to you,

02:38:47.993 --> 02:38:50.149
just still looking down at the spring.

02:38:54.796 --> 02:38:56.546
TALIESIN: I know it was supposed to be you.

02:39:03.426 --> 02:39:04.976
I didn't want to leave.

02:39:04.976 --> 02:39:05.836
I didn't want any of this.

02:39:05.836 --> 02:39:07.502
I was going to be the one who--

02:39:11.236 --> 02:39:12.936
I was going to be the one who stayed.

02:39:14.996 --> 02:39:15.829
I know.

02:39:19.636 --> 02:39:21.836
Sometimes I feel like I stole this from you.

02:39:26.076 --> 02:39:28.396
MATT: "Sometimes I think that, too, but--"

02:39:30.536 --> 02:39:34.556
TALIESIN: I have seen things

02:39:35.836 --> 02:39:36.669
that are

02:39:39.106 --> 02:39:39.939
amazing,

02:39:41.524 --> 02:39:44.339
beautiful beyond anything I could have imagined.

02:39:45.706 --> 02:39:46.606
And I have

02:39:48.516 --> 02:39:49.726
seen things that

02:39:54.786 --> 02:39:57.316
have taken parts of me,

02:39:57.316 --> 02:40:00.706
and I will wake up in the middle of the night

02:40:00.706 --> 02:40:02.179
for the rest of my life.

02:40:03.686 --> 02:40:04.802
There are--

02:40:07.154 --> 02:40:08.419
it is so big.

02:40:10.056 --> 02:40:12.996
And I don't know what you saw while you were gone

02:40:12.996 --> 02:40:16.399
on your travels, but it is just so big out there.

02:40:18.946 --> 02:40:20.129
And I didn't want it.

02:40:22.346 --> 02:40:23.399
Maybe a little.

02:40:34.226 --> 02:40:35.469
After you left,

02:40:38.656 --> 02:40:43.589
then Colton left and Dad left,

02:40:45.236 --> 02:40:46.949
even Clarabelle left.

02:40:49.646 --> 02:40:53.039
And time stopped meaning anything.

02:40:55.922 --> 02:40:57.152
And it was too quiet.

02:40:59.906 --> 02:41:01.759
And the Wild Mother wasn't speaking.

02:41:03.189 --> 02:41:04.764
And I was just here,

02:41:07.696 --> 02:41:09.049
keeping home,

02:41:11.336 --> 02:41:14.269
and waiting for a sign to leave.

02:41:20.258 --> 02:41:21.841
You know, I started

02:41:24.226 --> 02:41:27.119
eating the petals of the lilies.

02:41:29.606 --> 02:41:32.396
It was one of those old stories

02:41:32.396 --> 02:41:34.546
that this was the first--

02:41:34.546 --> 02:41:37.169
one of the first plants that maybe it had

02:41:40.826 --> 02:41:43.736
more of the first power that started this place, and

02:41:46.317 --> 02:41:48.436
I started having strange dreams.

02:41:48.436 --> 02:41:51.576
I hadn't even thought about them until we, I returned,

02:41:51.576 --> 02:41:52.696
'til today.

02:41:55.376 --> 02:41:58.226
And even those first dreams told me that this was coming.

02:42:02.306 --> 02:42:05.449
And if I were done, they would've stopped.

02:42:08.446 --> 02:42:09.859
And I don't want to go.

02:42:11.266 --> 02:42:13.410
I have-- I never-- I wasn't going to come home

02:42:13.410 --> 02:42:15.667
because I knew I wasn't going to want to go.

02:42:18.466 --> 02:42:20.166
But I don't want you to go either.

02:42:26.076 --> 02:42:27.459
Because it has to be me,

02:42:29.076 --> 02:42:30.909
because I've already seen it,

02:42:31.976 --> 02:42:35.146
and it will just horrify me just a little less

02:42:36.656 --> 02:42:37.706
than the rest of you.

02:42:41.306 --> 02:42:43.126
I want to be done.

02:42:43.126 --> 02:42:46.529
I want you to go and not do this.

02:42:48.036 --> 02:42:49.102
To be--

02:42:51.356 --> 02:42:52.917
I want it to be your turn.

02:43:00.814 --> 02:43:02.981
MATT: "(sighs)"

02:43:07.606 --> 02:43:09.495
She takes her rock and throws it into the water.

02:43:09.495 --> 02:43:11.015
(water splashing)

02:43:13.357 --> 02:43:16.993
And throws her wet hair back across her shoulder.

02:43:20.526 --> 02:43:21.819
TALIESIN: Smells so good.

02:43:22.916 --> 02:43:23.941
MATT: "Yeah.

02:43:28.816 --> 02:43:29.969
"It's just frustrating."

02:43:31.746 --> 02:43:32.579
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:43:35.076 --> 02:43:36.226
MATT: "It's frustrating that

02:43:37.636 --> 02:43:40.236
"you've gotten out and see the world and--

02:43:45.350 --> 02:43:46.267
"and you've--

02:43:54.206 --> 02:43:57.826
"I don't know, you made me proud in spite of myself.

02:43:57.826 --> 02:43:59.786
"And then--"
TALIESIN: Well, give me time.

02:43:59.786 --> 02:44:02.984
MATT: "I hate admitting it,

02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:11.473
"but it wasn't my time."

02:44:12.596 --> 02:44:14.426
TALIESIN: I still wear everything you gave me

02:44:14.426 --> 02:44:16.396
and everything you made for me.

02:44:16.396 --> 02:44:19.116
Never, never put any of it down.

02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:27.217
MATT: "(sighs)"

02:44:30.396 --> 02:44:32.266
She reaches in her pouch, and she pulls out something

02:44:32.266 --> 02:44:33.919
and holds it and goes,

02:44:38.893 --> 02:44:39.943
"Thanks for the hat,"

02:44:41.487 --> 02:44:43.727
and hands you this thing in her hand.

02:44:45.336 --> 02:44:48.706
You look and it's a bracelet,

02:44:48.706 --> 02:44:50.776
woven from silken burlap,

02:44:50.776 --> 02:44:54.376
that has glass beads periodically throughout it.

02:44:54.376 --> 02:44:56.562
It's simple but elegant.

02:44:57.683 --> 02:45:01.732
TALIESIN: You still do good work. (sniffs)

02:45:05.586 --> 02:45:06.986
MATT: "That'll smell like home for a while,

02:45:06.986 --> 02:45:08.149
"so while you're off,

02:45:09.846 --> 02:45:12.146
"I don't know, fighting this city or something."

02:45:14.484 --> 02:45:16.136
TALIESIN: Look at what the world has done to my hair.

02:45:16.136 --> 02:45:17.186
MATT: "I know, it looks awful."

02:45:17.186 --> 02:45:18.486
TALIESIN: It's so terrible.

02:45:23.136 --> 02:45:26.029
MATT: "I trust-- we all trust in your instincts.

02:45:27.079 --> 02:45:28.712
"You've always been the,

02:45:30.756 --> 02:45:31.589
"of everyone,

02:45:33.546 --> 02:45:35.311
"the one who just had a--

02:45:37.486 --> 02:45:39.886
"a better sense of how things were meant."

02:45:41.186 --> 02:45:43.426
TALIESIN: Clearly, I was wrong about my thoughts

02:45:43.426 --> 02:45:44.859
that I was going to stay here.

02:45:47.776 --> 02:45:49.711
Can't always be right.
MATT: "No."

02:45:51.616 --> 02:45:52.449
TALIESIN: And

02:45:54.426 --> 02:45:58.606
my sense, and I want to make sure you know this,

02:45:58.606 --> 02:46:00.429
is I don't think I'm coming back.

02:46:03.493 --> 02:46:06.396
And I'm not okay with it,

02:46:06.396 --> 02:46:09.166
but I'm making peace with it.

02:46:13.254 --> 02:46:15.046
If there's a way for my body to get back here,

02:46:15.046 --> 02:46:16.446
I'd be very grateful,

02:46:16.446 --> 02:46:19.759
but there's every possibility that that won't happen.

02:46:22.486 --> 02:46:24.186
I'd like my name somewhere if I'm--

02:46:27.276 --> 02:46:29.299
if there's nothing to bring back.

02:46:31.036 --> 02:46:32.573
That would be a comfort.

02:46:35.476 --> 02:46:38.309
MATT: Her demeanor gets extremely dark,

02:46:40.146 --> 02:46:43.709
cold, almost, as her eyes meet yours.

02:46:46.966 --> 02:46:49.476
It's odd to feel so close to your sister

02:46:49.476 --> 02:46:51.929
and in that moment feel so far away.

02:46:54.166 --> 02:46:54.999
She nods.

02:46:57.196 --> 02:46:58.246
"I'll look to it."

02:47:00.893 --> 02:47:03.043
TALIESIN: And I want you to take care of everybody.

02:47:04.876 --> 02:47:08.506
And especially, I want to make
sure you take care of yourself,

02:47:08.506 --> 02:47:12.099
and don't, don't get locked up here on my account.

02:47:14.746 --> 02:47:17.156
Your job is to get everyone situated

02:47:17.156 --> 02:47:19.156
and then make sure that you find

02:47:19.156 --> 02:47:20.896
whatever destiny you're supposed to have.

02:47:20.896 --> 02:47:23.216
I don't think you're supposed to be here.

02:47:23.216 --> 02:47:24.649
Not forever.

02:47:30.546 --> 02:47:32.780
Let Colin do that. It'll be funnier.

02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:35.182
MATT: "(chuckles) You're not wrong."

02:47:40.896 --> 02:47:41.946
TALIESIN: I'm thinking about,

02:47:42.996 --> 02:47:44.426
now that I'm here,

02:47:46.226 --> 02:47:48.886
doing, talking to the Wild Mother

02:47:48.886 --> 02:47:52.169
or maybe trying something a little out of the ordinary,

02:47:55.006 --> 02:47:58.081
seeing if she has something to say while I'm here.

02:48:00.156 --> 02:48:00.989
MATT: "Well,"

02:48:00.989 --> 02:48:03.156
and she stands up a little bit

02:48:03.156 --> 02:48:05.086
while you're still sitting,

02:48:05.086 --> 02:48:08.162
rain splashing across her face, still coming down.

02:48:12.079 --> 02:48:13.862
"May have to talk kinda loud."

02:48:20.546 --> 02:48:23.639
TALIESIN: And I stand up with my staff,

02:48:26.296 --> 02:48:27.712
put the bracelet on.

02:48:33.176 --> 02:48:35.619
Do you know, and I don't know if it's true,

02:48:36.886 --> 02:48:40.746
but there's a version of the story that says that

02:48:44.116 --> 02:48:48.576
they had, with the first hero that gave this place its power

02:48:50.516 --> 02:48:53.206
was put in the ground where the spring

02:48:55.176 --> 02:48:56.342
erupted from,

02:48:57.379 --> 02:49:02.206
and that point, and the flowers that grow from there,

02:49:02.206 --> 02:49:04.116
are the first flowers.

02:49:04.116 --> 02:49:07.926
I know that there's a lot of stories told,

02:49:07.926 --> 02:49:09.669
but that's the one I believe.

02:49:16.888 --> 02:49:18.616
I'm going to take the crystal off of my staff

02:49:18.616 --> 02:49:19.849
and put my staff down.

02:49:22.256 --> 02:49:24.556
I'm going to wade a little bit into the water.

02:49:25.547 --> 02:49:28.397
I'm going to take one of the pebbles and put it in my mouth,

02:49:32.996 --> 02:49:36.226
and I'm going to take a deep breath, holding the crystal,

02:49:36.226 --> 02:49:38.946
and step into the deeper points of the spring,

02:49:38.946 --> 02:49:42.046
and let myself take a big breath,

02:49:42.046 --> 02:49:43.859
and let myself sink and try and

02:49:45.566 --> 02:49:48.716
I guess Commune is the spell to cast.

02:49:48.716 --> 02:49:49.906
MATT: There is no better time

02:49:49.906 --> 02:49:52.206
but to cast Commune under these circumstances.

02:49:55.746 --> 02:49:56.579
All righty.

02:49:57.976 --> 02:49:59.826
TALIESIN: I'm going to use it in an unusual way.

02:50:00.736 --> 02:50:01.916
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Since I'm here.

02:50:01.916 --> 02:50:02.819
MATT: Explain.

02:50:04.946 --> 02:50:06.896
TALIESIN: I have been getting visions.

02:50:06.896 --> 02:50:08.386
I have been getting--

02:50:09.586 --> 02:50:12.186
it's not quite a yes or no question that I want to ask.

02:50:12.186 --> 02:50:13.572
I want to...

02:50:20.116 --> 02:50:22.779
it's not quite a plea for help, but

02:50:25.816 --> 02:50:27.876
I want whatever blessings that she can give

02:50:27.876 --> 02:50:31.176
and whatever, whatever she can do to make the road clearer

02:50:31.176 --> 02:50:32.726
and whatever she can do to make

02:50:34.936 --> 02:50:37.419
the notion of what we face stronger.

02:50:39.896 --> 02:50:42.439
MATT: As you descend beneath the waters,

02:50:42.439 --> 02:50:46.259
the cold spring waters,

02:50:47.866 --> 02:50:49.936
as the water overtakes your hearing,

02:50:49.936 --> 02:50:51.626
you can hear the muffled sounds

02:50:51.626 --> 02:50:54.569
of the rain breaking the surface.

02:50:56.506 --> 02:50:58.206
And then as you give in--

02:50:58.206 --> 02:51:00.314
TALIESIN: Casting this.
MATT: --to the depths,

02:51:03.016 --> 02:51:04.816
the waters around you begin to warm,

02:51:05.986 --> 02:51:08.369
the rolling thunder begins to fade,

02:51:11.666 --> 02:51:15.069
and you feel almost like you're being cradled,

02:51:16.566 --> 02:51:19.519
like something has scooped you up from underneath,

02:51:21.826 --> 02:51:23.409
and that warmth is welcoming.

02:51:24.847 --> 02:51:26.106
It smells sweet.

02:51:26.106 --> 02:51:27.601
It smells like,

02:51:30.436 --> 02:51:32.559
like a fresh rose after a rain.

02:51:35.956 --> 02:51:38.679
And as you concentrate for this focus,

02:51:40.956 --> 02:51:44.419
you sense that warmth will never truly fade,

02:51:47.606 --> 02:51:49.539
for the clarity of what you face,

02:51:51.156 --> 02:51:52.326
that warmth grows

02:51:53.946 --> 02:51:54.779
cold,

02:51:56.106 --> 02:51:57.489
and you sense something,

02:51:59.026 --> 02:52:00.796
open your eyes,

02:52:00.796 --> 02:52:03.469
like two fingers pull your lids open,

02:52:04.416 --> 02:52:09.209
and before you, you can see the visage of the Wild Mother,

02:52:11.496 --> 02:52:14.325
massive and all-encompassing before you,

02:52:14.325 --> 02:52:17.996
her beautiful brown skin, long red hair,

02:52:17.996 --> 02:52:22.106
every part of her just adjoining with nature.

02:52:22.106 --> 02:52:24.249
And she looks towards you with a sad face,

02:52:26.306 --> 02:52:28.286
and you see below her,

02:52:28.286 --> 02:52:32.299
in her amorphous body,

02:52:34.826 --> 02:52:35.759
seeds,

02:52:36.766 --> 02:52:38.436
seeds that when you begin to focus,

02:52:38.436 --> 02:52:41.246
the distance, the size, the scale, the scope,

02:52:41.246 --> 02:52:43.186
is so odd and off from this perspective,

02:52:43.186 --> 02:52:45.636
but each of these, these aren't seeds, these are,

02:52:46.826 --> 02:52:49.686
these are beings, these are souls, these are lives.

02:52:49.686 --> 02:52:50.869
These are...

02:52:54.486 --> 02:52:56.146
this is life.

02:52:56.146 --> 02:52:58.359
Everything living connected.

02:52:59.416 --> 02:53:00.756
And you can see it all connected to her,

02:53:00.756 --> 02:53:03.989
and she just looks at you, sad.

02:53:09.756 --> 02:53:12.646
As you hear the screams

02:53:15.006 --> 02:53:15.999
filtering in,

02:53:17.066 --> 02:53:19.659
the endless thousands of screams,

02:53:21.635 --> 02:53:24.993
and you watch as each of these seeds, these lights,

02:53:26.766 --> 02:53:27.599
go out.

02:53:33.806 --> 02:53:36.786
And the color fades from her,

02:53:36.786 --> 02:53:38.036
and you watch her wither,

02:53:39.556 --> 02:53:41.006
her eyes never leaving yours.

02:53:44.206 --> 02:53:45.586
And as best as she can convey,

02:53:45.586 --> 02:53:49.699
I think you understand the scope of what it is you face.

02:53:58.146 --> 02:53:58.979
TALIESIN: If I'm deep enough,

02:53:58.979 --> 02:54:00.769
I want to touch the bottom of the spring.

02:54:04.246 --> 02:54:09.246
MATT: You reach, and you find the muck, you find the roots,

02:54:09.816 --> 02:54:10.816
you find the bottom.

02:54:14.196 --> 02:54:15.846
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a big handful

02:54:18.406 --> 02:54:20.426
and wait till I'm almost out of breath

02:54:20.426 --> 02:54:23.899
and then start making my way back to the surface.

02:54:27.748 --> 02:54:29.098
MATT: (deep breath)

02:54:31.036 --> 02:54:33.359
Calliope stands there at the edge, still looking.

02:54:36.916 --> 02:54:38.683
"Did you find what you're looking for?"

02:54:39.536 --> 02:54:40.919
TALIESIN: Unfortunately.

02:54:49.726 --> 02:54:51.226
I get my hands nice and dirty.

02:54:57.205 --> 02:54:59.766
If I don't come back, it's your job to protect this place

02:54:59.766 --> 02:55:01.576
from whatever's coming.

02:55:01.576 --> 02:55:05.226
If I fail, she'll tell you what to do.

02:55:10.856 --> 02:55:12.836
MATT: As you step out of the water,

02:55:12.836 --> 02:55:14.663
she leans in and

02:55:17.116 --> 02:55:19.896
just wraps her arms around you for a second,

02:55:19.896 --> 02:55:21.596
leaning her head on your shoulder,

02:55:27.206 --> 02:55:29.983
takes a deep breath and pulls back and looks at you,

02:55:34.335 --> 02:55:36.044
and kicks you into the water.

02:55:36.044 --> 02:55:39.252
TALIESIN: (exclaims) And I'm down.

02:55:39.252 --> 02:55:41.502
(laughter)

02:55:42.709 --> 02:55:43.968
MATT: And she walks back into the house.

02:55:43.968 --> 02:55:47.561
TALIESIN: (sighs) Just going to take a second to float.

02:55:49.456 --> 02:55:51.056
MATT: Feeling the rain on your face.

02:55:52.081 --> 02:55:56.136
The last bit of light begins to fade into that distant blue.

02:55:56.136 --> 02:55:59.384
TALIESIN: Yeah, I had that coming, okay. (sighs)

02:55:59.384 --> 02:56:00.976
I'm going to pick up my things,

02:56:00.976 --> 02:56:05.976
and go back inside and make some apologies to the family.

02:56:09.296 --> 02:56:10.129
MATT: Okay.

02:56:12.586 --> 02:56:16.046
Meanwhile, for the rest of you, a meal begins to apparate.

02:56:16.046 --> 02:56:20.249
Food is being prepared, and while it is a vegetarian meal,

02:56:22.396 --> 02:56:23.926
you shouldn't be surprised at this point,

02:56:23.926 --> 02:56:26.336
make very good vegetarian food, as he has.

02:56:26.336 --> 02:56:27.169
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:56:27.169 --> 02:56:28.976
MATT: The smells fill the space,

02:56:28.976 --> 02:56:33.036
and the warm comforts of the Clay family

02:56:34.136 --> 02:56:37.076
brings a little bit of additional sense of home

02:56:37.076 --> 02:56:40.636
before this last leg of your journey begins anew.

02:56:47.036 --> 02:56:48.428
Conversations are had.

02:56:50.279 --> 02:56:51.295
TALIESIN: I, uh--

02:56:54.121 --> 02:56:55.396
I gained some clarity,

02:56:55.396 --> 02:56:57.559
I want to apologize to everyone for that,

02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:03.195
that bit of--

02:57:04.376 --> 02:57:07.593
that unfortunate outburst, I suppose.

02:57:07.593 --> 02:57:09.039
SAM: Out-- Outburst?

02:57:09.964 --> 02:57:13.246
TALIESIN: I'm not normally one to storm out.

02:57:13.246 --> 02:57:15.116
LAURA: Apology not accepted, I'm sorry.

02:57:15.116 --> 02:57:17.646
It looks like we can't travel together any further.

02:57:17.646 --> 02:57:20.166
TALIESIN: A blood feud it is, then, excellent.

02:57:20.166 --> 02:57:23.593
SAM: I mean, you just sort of walked out normal speed.
MATT: Cornelius is like, "Wait, what happened?"

02:57:23.593 --> 02:57:25.606
MARISHA: But there is a storm going on,

02:57:25.606 --> 02:57:28.186
so maybe that's what he meant by storming out.

02:57:28.186 --> 02:57:29.119
SAM: Wasn't very dramatic.

02:57:29.119 --> 02:57:30.796
TALIESIN: They've been a very bad influence on me,

02:57:30.796 --> 02:57:33.436
I'm going to have to get rid of a lot of language.

02:57:33.436 --> 02:57:35.246
TRAVIS: What kind of clarity did you gain?

02:57:35.246 --> 02:57:36.126
TALIESIN: Hmm?

02:57:36.126 --> 02:57:38.166
TRAVIS: What kind of clarity did you gain?

02:57:38.166 --> 02:57:39.407
TALIESIN: Well...

02:57:45.506 --> 02:57:47.119
I don't want to go,

02:57:49.914 --> 02:57:51.379
I don't want to leave home,

02:57:52.476 --> 02:57:56.196
but that is not on the car-- that is not on the table.

02:57:56.196 --> 02:57:58.286
That is not an option.

02:57:58.286 --> 02:57:59.426
There is--

02:58:04.256 --> 02:58:06.979
I don't think there's any way out of this for any of us.

02:58:10.330 --> 02:58:12.068
LAURA: Well, yeah.

02:58:12.068 --> 02:58:13.043
TALIESIN: I, uh--

02:58:15.173 --> 02:58:19.776
Before I met you all, I had started,

02:58:19.776 --> 02:58:22.109
I apologize, Mom, Dad,

02:58:22.956 --> 02:58:26.136
it started in sort of inducing

02:58:32.004 --> 02:58:33.786
a connection to the Wild Mother

02:58:33.786 --> 02:58:37.839
through the ingestion of certain flowers.

02:58:38.716 --> 02:58:39.636
Coping.

02:58:39.636 --> 02:58:40.981
MATT: Constance, you hear her turn around and go,

02:58:40.981 --> 02:58:43.263
"Ugh! He gets that from you."

02:58:46.436 --> 02:58:48.696
TALIESIN: Hoping to gain some

02:58:48.696 --> 02:58:50.536
insight as to what I was supposed to do

02:58:50.536 --> 02:58:52.486
and how I was supposed to save my home.

02:58:53.806 --> 02:58:55.196
It had been so long,

02:58:55.196 --> 02:58:59.236
and it seemed like its significance had ended,

02:58:59.236 --> 02:59:03.487
and coming home reminded me of the,

02:59:04.876 --> 02:59:08.029
the last vision I had before you all arrived,

02:59:10.266 --> 02:59:13.846
which was, I remembered, I saw this

02:59:15.228 --> 02:59:20.228
river of dark water that the bottom that could not be seen,

02:59:21.556 --> 02:59:24.056
and it would move, it moved through,

02:59:24.056 --> 02:59:27.129
through the valleys and emptied into the ocean.

02:59:29.696 --> 02:59:30.626
And then I saw

02:59:32.376 --> 02:59:33.950
the forest.

02:59:33.950 --> 02:59:36.339
I saw this mighty forest,

02:59:38.086 --> 02:59:39.959
and the trees had eyes.

02:59:42.906 --> 02:59:44.269
The trees had eyes.

02:59:47.026 --> 02:59:49.676
And then I looked into the sky, and the sky had eyes.

02:59:52.436 --> 02:59:56.735
And then I looked down, and there was the spring,

02:59:56.735 --> 02:59:59.656
and there were eyes at the bottom of the spring.

03:00:04.626 --> 03:00:08.586
And then I turned to my family grave,

03:00:08.586 --> 03:00:11.476
to the stones of-- the stones of the Clays,

03:00:13.413 --> 03:00:18.366
and nine strange butterflies

03:00:20.876 --> 03:00:24.529
drinking from the nectar of those blooms.

03:00:29.906 --> 03:00:32.076
There's no getting out of this.

03:00:32.076 --> 03:00:35.516
LAURA: (indignant spluttering)
You had that dream forever ago?

03:00:35.516 --> 03:00:36.926
TALIESIN: I had a lot of dreams forever ago.

03:00:36.926 --> 03:00:40.069
LAURA: But, ugh! You had a dream about eyes?

03:00:41.686 --> 03:00:43.123
TALIESIN: And then you showed up.

03:00:43.123 --> 03:00:44.339
LAURA: (spluttering)

03:00:48.202 --> 03:00:52.686
TALIESIN: I thought I'd-- I thought
it all made sense at the time.

03:00:52.686 --> 03:00:54.726
It felt like someone was coming at the end of it,

03:00:54.726 --> 03:00:56.266
that I was expecting something,

03:00:56.266 --> 03:00:59.639
and the next morning, here you were.

03:00:59.639 --> 03:01:00.746
LAURA: Well, not me.

03:01:00.746 --> 03:01:02.066
TALIESIN: Not you, but--

03:01:03.376 --> 03:01:04.209
SAM: But us.

03:01:06.236 --> 03:01:11.133
TALIESIN: I woke up and started packing,

03:01:15.476 --> 03:01:17.089
and there you were.

03:01:17.089 --> 03:01:18.514
And then I made tea.

03:01:20.846 --> 03:01:24.346
SAM: Well, that's reassuring in some ways, you know?

03:01:24.346 --> 03:01:25.849
It's like it was fated to be.

03:01:27.283 --> 03:01:29.933
TALIESIN: I feel like a lot of
things were maybe fated to be.

03:01:32.624 --> 03:01:33.457
MARISHA: Eyes.

03:01:35.256 --> 03:01:37.037
TALIESIN: That was a long time ago.

03:01:39.426 --> 03:01:40.259
LAURA: Whoa.

03:01:41.826 --> 03:01:45.294
All that was in motion that long ago.

03:01:47.296 --> 03:01:48.659
TRAVIS: Well, we're back here now.

03:01:49.566 --> 03:01:51.899
Is there anything we can do here before we go?

03:01:53.036 --> 03:01:54.376
Is there a source of corruption,

03:01:54.376 --> 03:01:56.206
something that your family has detected?

03:01:56.206 --> 03:01:59.366
Something that you're being pulled towards?

03:01:59.366 --> 03:02:00.199
LAURA: That's true. We're here

03:02:00.199 --> 03:02:02.106
because of the vision that you saw.

03:02:04.806 --> 03:02:07.776
TALIESIN: I've seen something of what the Wild Mother

03:02:07.776 --> 03:02:08.869
wanted to tell me.

03:02:10.556 --> 03:02:12.666
Is anything else-- have you seen anything else?

03:02:12.666 --> 03:02:13.929
Has anything gone awry?

03:02:16.986 --> 03:02:17.819
MATT: "Hmm."

03:02:17.819 --> 03:02:18.866
Then they turn to look--

03:02:18.866 --> 03:02:20.566
they all look at each other and--

03:02:24.663 --> 03:02:26.763
(as Cornelius) "No, not in particular.

03:02:27.656 --> 03:02:29.116
"Just a sense of

03:02:33.406 --> 03:02:34.922
"something coming.

03:02:37.636 --> 03:02:40.056
"It's hard to describe, just a growing,

03:02:44.459 --> 03:02:45.659
"a growing fear.

03:02:53.506 --> 03:02:55.219
"I wish I could give more detail."

03:02:57.686 --> 03:03:00.019
Looks over to Constance, who goes,

03:03:09.707 --> 03:03:11.124
"I'm just worried."

03:03:12.106 --> 03:03:12.939
TALIESIN: Me, too.

03:03:18.456 --> 03:03:19.576
MATT: (as Constance) "I feel like whatever this is,

03:03:19.576 --> 03:03:21.619
"this is more than the Grove by far."

03:03:23.926 --> 03:03:24.759
TALIESIN: It is.

03:03:35.082 --> 03:03:35.915
LIAM: Well,

03:03:38.068 --> 03:03:41.376
feels like we're here for the night.

03:03:41.376 --> 03:03:42.209
LAURA: Yeah.

03:03:43.150 --> 03:03:45.352
TALIESIN: I do appreciate this.

03:03:45.352 --> 03:03:49.718
I'm going to resupply on a few things I can only get here.

03:03:49.718 --> 03:03:52.161
LAURA: Oh, okay. Yeah--
LIAM: Caduceus, it's--

03:03:53.596 --> 03:03:55.888
it's nice to have a home-cooked meal.

03:03:57.846 --> 03:04:00.979
Four walls and a roof for a spell.

03:04:02.168 --> 03:04:03.576
TALIESIN: I was going to say you're welcome to

03:04:03.576 --> 03:04:05.926
put up the mansion, if you are so inclined,

03:04:05.926 --> 03:04:10.186
although I will admit I found the house oddly cozy.

03:04:10.186 --> 03:04:11.844
MARISHA: I like the smells in this place.

03:04:11.844 --> 03:04:13.466
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: It smells good.

03:04:13.466 --> 03:04:14.606
ASHLEY: I have to say, I--

03:04:14.606 --> 03:04:16.948
this is one of the most wonderful places

03:04:16.948 --> 03:04:19.516
I think I've ever been to.

03:04:19.516 --> 03:04:21.516
TALIESIN: I would recommend walking the grounds.

03:04:22.726 --> 03:04:23.559
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:04:25.009 --> 03:04:26.306
LIAM: Uh, Jester.

03:04:26.306 --> 03:04:27.916
Before the end of the night,

03:04:27.916 --> 03:04:31.346
remember, maybe we can check in on--

03:04:31.346 --> 03:04:34.417
LAURA: Definitely, we can, I can cast--

03:04:35.346 --> 03:04:37.646
I can send messages to lots of people.

03:04:42.155 --> 03:04:43.072
MARISHA: Caduceus.

03:04:44.839 --> 03:04:48.376
This feels like a place with

03:04:48.376 --> 03:04:49.276
lots of

03:04:51.556 --> 03:04:55.696
tranquil energy and connection and

03:04:55.696 --> 03:05:00.126
maybe some rich arcane vibes.

03:05:00.126 --> 03:05:01.546
TALIESIN: You are not wrong.

03:05:02.856 --> 03:05:06.906
MARISHA: You think if I did some meditating of my own

03:05:06.906 --> 03:05:07.926
that I would have

03:05:10.136 --> 03:05:12.519
maybe a better chance at success,

03:05:14.436 --> 03:05:18.929
or do you think it's not the right kind of vibe?

03:05:19.896 --> 03:05:24.436
TALIESIN: I think this place is very special,

03:05:25.454 --> 03:05:26.486
and this place

03:05:28.216 --> 03:05:31.416
is for a conflux of deities.

03:05:31.416 --> 03:05:33.449
It was built by one for another,

03:05:35.256 --> 03:05:40.049
and faiths of all sorts are buried here.

03:05:41.576 --> 03:05:43.306
MARISHA: What if I want to try and contact something

03:05:43.306 --> 03:05:45.939
that's not of a certain faith?

03:05:46.854 --> 03:05:48.754
TALIESIN: What do you want to try and contact?

03:05:54.442 --> 03:05:57.799
MARISHA: I just point to the back of my hand.

03:05:57.799 --> 03:05:58.874
TALIESIN: Hmm.

03:06:01.068 --> 03:06:03.676
LAURA: (whispers) That's a bad idea.

03:06:07.851 --> 03:06:12.035
TALIESIN: I don't know where the safest place would be.

03:06:13.646 --> 03:06:14.549
I'll say,

03:06:20.926 --> 03:06:24.429
if you walk and find a place that feels right,

03:06:26.376 --> 03:06:27.209
I trust you.

03:06:30.916 --> 03:06:33.109
Find a-- find a stone that feels right.

03:06:35.766 --> 03:06:37.519
MARISHA: We showed up on your doorstep.

03:06:39.606 --> 03:06:42.026
You don't think that this could be bringing more

03:06:43.726 --> 03:06:46.989
darkness and corruption into your life, do you?

03:06:48.787 --> 03:06:50.647
TALIESIN: I would be impressed if we could

03:06:50.647 --> 03:06:52.117
find a way to bring more

03:06:53.017 --> 03:06:55.020
darkness and corruption into our lives.

03:06:56.377 --> 03:06:58.027
What's the point of...

03:07:00.597 --> 03:07:03.907
What's the point of maintaining a place like this

03:07:05.217 --> 03:07:07.667
if its job is to be useless in a time of

03:07:09.087 --> 03:07:09.970
hardship?

03:07:13.387 --> 03:07:15.260
This is not a bunker.

03:07:17.197 --> 03:07:19.294
This is the Wild Mother and this is the Arch Heart

03:07:19.294 --> 03:07:20.960
and this is their place.

03:07:23.217 --> 03:07:24.050
I'm not worried.

03:07:24.997 --> 03:07:27.370
She'll tell you if she doesn't want you to do it.

03:07:29.907 --> 03:07:34.057
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, there's no corruption here?

03:07:34.057 --> 03:07:35.337
I thought you had a vision of something

03:07:35.337 --> 03:07:37.318
that was corrupting the trees or the ground,

03:07:37.318 --> 03:07:39.307
or something we're going to be investigating

03:07:39.307 --> 03:07:41.307
that might give some sort of a shade

03:07:41.307 --> 03:07:42.547
of what we would be seeing.

03:07:42.547 --> 03:07:45.520
LAURA: Yeah, the city was taking over here.

03:07:46.967 --> 03:07:49.407
TRAVIS: Your family hasn't noticed anything like that?

03:07:49.407 --> 03:07:51.447
Nothing we can check, or?

03:07:51.447 --> 03:07:53.547
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to do a walk around anyway.

03:07:55.427 --> 03:07:58.667
TRAVIS: Constance, Cornelius, you've seen nothing like this?

03:07:58.667 --> 03:07:59.570
Your family?

03:08:02.967 --> 03:08:04.967
MATT: Constance thinks for a second.

03:08:08.004 --> 03:08:12.554
"No, I mean, ever since the

03:08:12.554 --> 03:08:14.494
"completion of your trek,

03:08:14.494 --> 03:08:18.687
"and when you saved us all from that horrible

03:08:19.674 --> 03:08:22.944
"stone-bringing creature, the crystals you brought back

03:08:22.944 --> 03:08:25.044
"fought back the corruption of the forest,

03:08:25.945 --> 03:08:28.534
"and the Grove has been cleansed.

03:08:28.534 --> 03:08:29.837
"It's been saved."

03:08:29.837 --> 03:08:31.547
LAURA: Is that a sign?

03:08:31.547 --> 03:08:35.107
Should we do something with the crystals?

03:08:35.107 --> 03:08:37.557
Do you think that would help us against the city?

03:08:40.047 --> 03:08:43.257
Maybe you got a vision of the city overtaking here

03:08:43.257 --> 03:08:46.510
because it's so angry that it got forced out.

03:08:49.768 --> 03:08:52.010
TALIESIN: Is there still corruption at the edges?

03:08:53.324 --> 03:08:58.324
MATT: (as Cornelius) "Oh, yeah, the
whole wood is still the wood.

03:08:59.402 --> 03:09:01.910
"Just the Grove is protected now."

03:09:05.347 --> 03:09:07.414
TALIESIN: Does anyone want to take a walk?

03:09:07.414 --> 03:09:08.247
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: Sure.

03:09:08.247 --> 03:09:09.247
ASHLEY: Yes, I would love to.

03:09:09.247 --> 03:09:11.387
LIAM: Well, if you're going, we're
going to keep an eye on you.

03:09:11.387 --> 03:09:12.220
TALIESIN: Calliope?

03:09:14.196 --> 03:09:15.229
MATT: "Of course.

03:09:16.914 --> 03:09:18.147
"Clarabelle?"

03:09:18.147 --> 03:09:19.681
She's like, "Yeah?"

03:09:21.447 --> 03:09:23.694
(as Calliope) "See if we can muster |
up enough blankets and cushions

03:09:23.694 --> 03:09:26.774
"for our guests to sleep semi-comfortable tonight."

03:09:27.884 --> 03:09:29.009
(as Clarabelle) "Okie dokie."

03:09:29.887 --> 03:09:30.720
She runs off.

03:09:34.517 --> 03:09:36.177
TALIESIN: I want to take a walk at the edges

03:09:36.177 --> 03:09:39.047
and inspect the new crystals and

03:09:39.047 --> 03:09:41.807
take everyone around to see what they see.

03:09:41.807 --> 03:09:42.907
MATT: Okay.

03:09:42.907 --> 03:09:44.982
TALIESIN: See what the borders look like now.

03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:52.707
MATT: You all step out into the evening rain now.

03:09:52.707 --> 03:09:53.900
The light quite dark.

03:09:55.339 --> 03:09:57.457
If any of you want to bring some particular light sources

03:09:57.457 --> 03:09:58.953
or create some light sources it would be

03:09:58.953 --> 03:10:00.210
recommended at this hour.

03:10:00.210 --> 03:10:01.715
TALIESIN: (light igniting)

03:10:02.607 --> 03:10:04.857
MARISHA: Can we get some globules, maybe, Caleb?

03:10:07.227 --> 03:10:08.834
LIAM: Yeah, if you want dim light, I can do that.

03:10:08.834 --> 03:10:11.707
If you want bright light, I can do better,

03:10:11.707 --> 03:10:13.757
but probably dim.

03:10:13.757 --> 03:10:16.460
MARISHA: Yeah, matches the vibe.

03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:20.041
LIAM: (globules popping into existence)

03:10:20.041 --> 03:10:22.447
MARISHA: (surprised noise)

03:10:22.447 --> 03:10:23.697
MATT: As you guys begin to walk around

03:10:23.697 --> 03:10:27.230
this fresh post-dusk hour,

03:10:28.257 --> 03:10:29.950
the Grove is beautiful.

03:10:30.957 --> 03:10:32.507
And as you peruse the exterior,

03:10:32.507 --> 03:10:37.507
you can see the elements of those crystalline trees,

03:10:37.637 --> 03:10:40.017
the four that have

03:10:41.357 --> 03:10:44.747
magically assembled since their implantation

03:10:44.747 --> 03:10:46.700
at the outskirts of the Grove.

03:10:48.277 --> 03:10:50.174
The trees themselves are semi-translucent.

03:10:50.174 --> 03:10:52.082
There's purple and pink,

03:10:53.687 --> 03:10:57.897
almost woven threads, like braided textures

03:10:57.897 --> 03:10:59.777
of different types of crystal that bind

03:10:59.777 --> 03:11:01.110
and twist into each other.

03:11:03.817 --> 03:11:07.387
The roots themselves extend and

03:11:07.387 --> 03:11:09.630
follow the perimeter of the premises.

03:11:10.837 --> 03:11:14.960
They stand probably eight, nine feet tall,

03:11:16.347 --> 03:11:21.347
thin, but nevertheless stalwart in where they're placed.

03:11:23.777 --> 03:11:25.827
Looking past where the trees are,

03:11:25.827 --> 03:11:28.027
and there is a radius around them

03:11:28.027 --> 03:11:30.607
where you can see the greenery continues past

03:11:30.607 --> 03:11:33.410
the outer edge of the fence that contains the Grove,

03:11:34.897 --> 03:11:39.897
and about three or so, four feet from the outer edge,

03:11:40.037 --> 03:11:43.157
you can see the grass begins to

03:11:43.157 --> 03:11:44.737
get ever so faintly

03:11:45.877 --> 03:11:50.487
darker, and dryer, and the heavy tree canopy

03:11:50.487 --> 03:11:54.747
beyond there almost immediately becomes

03:11:54.747 --> 03:11:57.977
the familiar corrupt coloration

03:11:57.977 --> 03:12:00.544
of the rest of the Savalirwood.

03:12:00.544 --> 03:12:05.544
That odd, purple-gray color

03:12:05.837 --> 03:12:06.910
to the leaves.

03:12:11.957 --> 03:12:16.147
And while you may have questioned it beforehand,

03:12:16.147 --> 03:12:19.887
there is some element of similarity,

03:12:19.887 --> 03:12:23.727
in some ways, to the forest you had encountered

03:12:25.097 --> 03:12:29.876
in the Aeorian ruin and Eiselcross.

03:12:29.876 --> 03:12:31.239
Different types of trees,

03:12:32.377 --> 03:12:35.747
but the corruption is somewhat familiar.

03:12:35.747 --> 03:12:37.357
LAURA: What did it do here?

03:12:37.357 --> 03:12:39.220
How did it get all the way down here?

03:12:42.307 --> 03:12:46.157
TALIESIN: This is old, it's the same--
LAURA: So is the fucking city.

03:12:46.157 --> 03:12:48.087
LIAM: Few thousand years old.

03:12:48.087 --> 03:12:50.940
TALIESIN: This corruption is-- it's the same corruption.

03:12:51.827 --> 03:12:53.977
MATT: This corruption is hundreds of years old.

03:12:54.957 --> 03:12:57.217
LAURA: What if... (gasps)

03:12:57.217 --> 03:12:59.320
What if, oh, I don't know, that's stupid.

03:12:59.320 --> 03:13:00.707
SAM: What?
TALIESIN: No.

03:13:00.707 --> 03:13:02.957
LAURA: I don't know, what if, like, some of the relics

03:13:02.957 --> 03:13:06.220
from Aeor or something got brought down here?

03:13:07.077 --> 03:13:10.937
Didn't they say, like, a lot of
weird relics are here as well?

03:13:10.937 --> 03:13:12.730
That's from the elven city.

03:13:14.497 --> 03:13:16.313
MATT: The elven city of Molaesmyr is where

03:13:16.313 --> 03:13:18.440
the corruption seemed to stem from.

03:13:20.707 --> 03:13:21.957
SAM: Which is close to here?

03:13:23.109 --> 03:13:25.700
MATT: It's a number of miles away.

03:13:27.317 --> 03:13:29.480
LAURA: Maybe the elven city was infected.

03:13:32.367 --> 03:13:33.330
SAM: Infected?

03:13:34.317 --> 03:13:35.959
TALIESIN: Maybe.
SAM: With what?

03:13:35.959 --> 03:13:37.997
LAURA: Whatever this is.

03:13:37.997 --> 03:13:39.527
ASHLEY: How far in is it--
LAURA: Elves are old.

03:13:39.527 --> 03:13:40.557
ASHLEY: That city's already gone?

03:13:40.557 --> 03:13:42.037
TALIESIN: I would know where the ruins are.

03:13:42.037 --> 03:13:43.005
MATT: You would.

03:13:43.005 --> 03:13:44.424
You have not been there because it is

03:13:44.424 --> 03:13:47.407
extremely dangerous to go near them.

03:13:47.407 --> 03:13:50.686
But--
MARISHA: Timeline's different.

03:13:50.686 --> 03:13:52.936
MATT: It was once, and you would know this,

03:13:52.936 --> 03:13:54.061
and I believe I spoke of it before,

03:13:54.061 --> 03:13:57.607
it was once the center of Elvish culture

03:13:57.607 --> 03:13:58.637
here in Wildemount.

03:13:58.637 --> 03:14:01.227
It was a thriving

03:14:02.147 --> 03:14:02.980
elf

03:14:04.307 --> 03:14:06.737
city, massive city.

03:14:06.737 --> 03:14:10.370
And one day, something went wrong.

03:14:11.427 --> 03:14:13.027
LAURA: And how long ago was that?

03:14:13.027 --> 03:14:15.020
MATT: A few hundred years ago.
LAURA: Okay.

03:14:15.947 --> 03:14:19.237
MATT: And it corrupted the majority of the Savalirwood,

03:14:19.237 --> 03:14:22.067
destroyed the city, or at least left it abandoned.

03:14:22.067 --> 03:14:26.347
Many, many people died, and those that survived

03:14:26.347 --> 03:14:29.307
fled northward to

03:14:29.307 --> 03:14:33.637
the doors of Uthodurn to create the diarchy there,

03:14:33.637 --> 03:14:36.127
or fled to the sea to the west

03:14:36.127 --> 03:14:39.807
around the top of the Empire and founded Bysaes Tyl,

03:14:39.807 --> 03:14:42.657
which is the one elven city within the Empire.

03:14:42.657 --> 03:14:45.367
LAURA: Those elves learned about what happened.

03:14:45.367 --> 03:14:47.089
They were trying to communicate as well

03:14:47.089 --> 03:14:49.057
and it opened the door to the Somnovem.

03:14:49.057 --> 03:14:50.827
MARISHA: History keeps repeating itself.

03:14:50.827 --> 03:14:51.660
LAURA: Yep.

03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:53.837
MARISHA: A bunch of fancy-ass mages

03:14:54.937 --> 03:14:58.237
trying to tap into some ancient power, wreaking havoc.

03:14:58.237 --> 03:14:59.217
LIAM: The forest

03:15:01.107 --> 03:15:05.011
pre-dated, was from here,

03:15:05.011 --> 03:15:07.240
just a long time ago--
LAURA: Yeah, the forest was fine.

03:15:09.857 --> 03:15:12.487
MATT: The corruption that you saw in the ruin

03:15:12.487 --> 03:15:15.192
was a different part of the city than Cognouza.

03:15:15.192 --> 03:15:16.025
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:15:16.947 --> 03:15:19.090
MATT: It was a portion of Aeor.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:15:19.090 --> 03:15:22.077
MATT: But you're uncertain
if it has any specific connotation

03:15:22.077 --> 03:15:24.027
to the Somnovem--

03:15:24.027 --> 03:15:27.117
LIAM: One ward of the city went to another place,

03:15:27.117 --> 03:15:30.723
the rest of it crash landed and that is

03:15:30.723 --> 03:15:32.297
what we were picking through.

03:15:32.297 --> 03:15:35.400
Not the portion of the city that went to the Astral Sea.

03:15:36.287 --> 03:15:38.197
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: So that corruption

03:15:39.167 --> 03:15:42.842
didn't come from the Somnovem,

03:15:42.842 --> 03:15:47.333
that forest existed already.

03:15:49.447 --> 03:15:54.447
MARISHA: I think it depends on
whatever type of residual magic--

03:15:56.297 --> 03:15:57.787
TALIESIN: No, you're right.

03:15:58.986 --> 03:16:00.069
You're right!

03:16:02.397 --> 03:16:04.187
LIAM: I don't think we have a definitive answer,

03:16:04.187 --> 03:16:06.245
but there is at least a chance that

03:16:06.245 --> 03:16:08.627
the elves of this forest

03:16:12.367 --> 03:16:14.040
came in contact with, discovered,

03:16:14.957 --> 03:16:16.607
something from the people of old.

03:16:18.180 --> 03:16:20.942
I mean, the elves are people of old, but

03:16:20.942 --> 03:16:22.357
from long ago.

03:16:22.357 --> 03:16:24.277
I don't have any answers.

03:16:24.277 --> 03:16:26.077
LAURA: How does it help us?

03:16:26.077 --> 03:16:27.680
How can we use that knowledge?

03:16:29.267 --> 03:16:31.217
TRAVIS: Yeah, other than talking to them?

03:16:31.217 --> 03:16:33.237
LIAM: We're like ants trying to understand the contents

03:16:33.237 --> 03:16:34.637
of a book we're crawling on.

03:16:35.942 --> 03:16:38.421
TRAVIS: I mean, I suppose that city that we've never been to

03:16:38.421 --> 03:16:42.957
that's up and around the way, the Bellisblayoh, what was it?

03:16:42.957 --> 03:16:44.970
MATT: Molaesmyr.
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:16:44.970 --> 03:16:47.424
SAM: Brelesbrao.

03:16:47.424 --> 03:16:49.080
TALIESIN: Molaesmyr.

03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:50.537
TRAVIS: You know, with all that time we don't have

03:16:50.537 --> 03:16:53.137
we could go and talk to them about what happened

03:16:53.137 --> 03:16:54.707
to their old city.

03:16:54.707 --> 03:16:56.557
LIAM: Nope, that's a <i>nein</i>.
LAURA: Or are they gone?

03:16:56.557 --> 03:16:58.597
MATT: Oh, they're gone, it's abandoned.

03:16:58.597 --> 03:16:59.837
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I know that some of them went up

03:16:59.837 --> 03:17:02.218
to Uthodurn and then you said another one went woo,

03:17:02.218 --> 03:17:03.927
up to this other thing, and it had a bleh.

03:17:03.927 --> 03:17:04.760
MATT: Correct.

03:17:04.760 --> 03:17:06.397
TALIESIN: The generation's passed now, though.

03:17:06.397 --> 03:17:08.067
MARISHA: I mean, it all is connected

03:17:08.067 --> 03:17:11.927
back to that same time of when relics started

03:17:11.927 --> 03:17:14.707
being uncovered from Aeor and

03:17:16.127 --> 03:17:18.337
this information started being spread.

03:17:18.337 --> 03:17:20.215
TALIESIN: We all still need to sleep, right?

03:17:20.215 --> 03:17:22.410
It's a bit rough.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:22.410 --> 03:17:24.467
TALIESIN: Well, I don't normally do this,

03:17:24.467 --> 03:17:27.342
but I'm going to try one more Commune.

03:17:27.342 --> 03:17:28.175
MATT: Okay.

03:17:39.247 --> 03:17:41.797
TALIESIN: Is there a clue

03:17:43.687 --> 03:17:48.190
to what it is we face in the abandoned city Molaesmyr?

03:17:52.537 --> 03:17:53.370
Thank you.

03:17:56.888 --> 03:17:58.504
MATT: So what was the question again? I'm sorry.

03:17:58.504 --> 03:17:59.687
TALIESIN: Is there a clue

03:17:59.687 --> 03:18:03.961
to what we face in the abandoned city Molaesmyr?

03:18:06.017 --> 03:18:08.717
MATT: You sense the Wild Mother blowing through on the cold,

03:18:08.717 --> 03:18:12.660
rainy wind, as it smatters the side of your face.

03:18:15.757 --> 03:18:18.937
In that cold darkness as your eyes are closed,

03:18:18.937 --> 03:18:20.017
you sense that...

03:18:22.457 --> 03:18:23.710
Likely not directly.

03:18:31.179 --> 03:18:34.312
TALIESIN: Would there be something to help us in our battle?

03:18:42.347 --> 03:18:44.920
MATT: You get the sense from her that--

03:18:47.877 --> 03:18:50.727
The imagery that comes to you is of many things

03:18:50.727 --> 03:18:53.050
across many lands that could be helpful,

03:18:54.417 --> 03:18:58.067
but you quickly see a tree lose its leaves.

03:18:58.067 --> 03:18:58.900
Time passes.

03:19:12.778 --> 03:19:13.778
TALIESIN: Is this...

03:19:16.222 --> 03:19:18.717
Is the source of this corruption the same?

03:19:20.093 --> 03:19:22.400
From the same origin?

03:19:28.937 --> 03:19:30.142
MATT: The same as which one?

03:19:30.142 --> 03:19:35.142
TALIESIN: As the corruption in the forest, underneath the,

03:19:35.587 --> 03:19:36.460
in the cavern.

03:19:39.507 --> 03:19:41.817
MATT: You see the two disparate forests through time,

03:19:41.817 --> 03:19:45.744
imagery of one within a city,

03:19:45.744 --> 03:19:48.307
and one around a city.

03:19:48.307 --> 03:19:49.530
Different times.

03:19:53.977 --> 03:19:54.930
Similar threats.

03:19:56.158 --> 03:19:57.124
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

03:20:00.907 --> 03:20:04.907
TALIESIN: They are connected,
but we are running out of time.

03:20:04.907 --> 03:20:06.597
TRAVIS: Right, I say we don't sleep.

03:20:06.597 --> 03:20:09.681
We go to Aeor right now.
Let's get it on.

03:20:09.681 --> 03:20:12.778
(laughter)

03:20:12.778 --> 03:20:14.511
MARISHA: ♪ Let's get it on! ♪

03:20:16.047 --> 03:20:18.197
TRAVIS: Sleep?
LAURA: Sleep.

03:20:18.197 --> 03:20:20.637
TALIESIN: Suppose we must sleep.
LAURA: Wake up.

03:20:20.637 --> 03:20:23.860
Go fight some astral cities.

03:20:27.797 --> 03:20:29.957
MARISHA: I'm going to take a little walk real quick.

03:20:29.957 --> 03:20:31.887
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Do what you have to do.

03:20:31.887 --> 03:20:32.720
MARISHA: I'll be back.

03:20:34.397 --> 03:20:35.922
Caleb, do you want to join?

03:20:35.922 --> 03:20:38.177
TRAVIS: (laughing) Wait, hold on.

03:20:38.177 --> 03:20:40.697
The two motherfuckers with red eyes on their bodies

03:20:40.697 --> 03:20:43.037
are not going <i>by themselves</i> into the woods.

03:20:43.037 --> 03:20:44.905
It'll be the last time we see--
MARISHA: We're not going into the woods.

03:20:44.905 --> 03:20:48.039
TRAVIS: Wherever your walk is, you'll get a chaperone, okay?

03:20:48.039 --> 03:20:50.056
You get a chaperone.

03:20:50.056 --> 03:20:52.656
MARISHA: Okay, Caduceus. Come on, chaperone us.

03:20:55.897 --> 03:20:58.232
TRAVIS: I gotta kill Caduceus.

03:20:59.207 --> 03:21:01.143
MARISHA: (stabbing sound)

03:21:01.143 --> 03:21:03.668
TALIESIN: (shushing)

03:21:03.668 --> 03:21:06.912
Do you have any more acid, because you can...

03:21:06.912 --> 03:21:09.207
MARISHA: No, I got to hit the Veth up for that.

03:21:09.207 --> 03:21:10.887
TALIESIN: That's my punishment for bad Southern.

03:21:10.887 --> 03:21:11.720
Carry on.

03:21:12.747 --> 03:21:14.247
LIAM: Keep it quiet, Laura Bailey.

03:21:16.167 --> 03:21:19.461
If I want to destroy the campaign with Marisha, I'll do it!

03:21:19.461 --> 03:21:21.427
TALIESIN: I'm going to watch and rest on a crystal tree

03:21:21.427 --> 03:21:22.897
and just sort of watch.

03:21:22.897 --> 03:21:23.894
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Destroy?

03:21:23.894 --> 03:21:25.487
MARISHA: Beau and Caleb are that little girl

03:21:25.487 --> 03:21:27.380
in front of the burning house?

03:21:27.380 --> 03:21:29.126
LIAM: (laughs)

03:21:29.126 --> 03:21:31.154
MATT: (thunder rumbling)

03:21:31.154 --> 03:21:32.382
LAURA: Oh!

03:21:32.382 --> 03:21:34.467
MATT: The storm has definitely arrived,

03:21:34.467 --> 03:21:36.052
the rain is getting heavier.

03:21:36.052 --> 03:21:37.549
What did the two of you want to do?

03:21:37.549 --> 03:21:38.957
TRAVIS: Get out there!
SAM: It's you!

03:21:38.957 --> 03:21:40.214
It's your story!
TRAVIS: Get out there!

03:21:40.214 --> 03:21:42.089
SAM: You're the storm!

03:21:42.089 --> 03:21:44.257
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:21:45.540 --> 03:21:47.392
I'm going to walk around, and I'm going to do

03:21:47.392 --> 03:21:50.277
exactly what Caduceus advised me to do.

03:21:50.277 --> 03:21:53.397
And I'm just going to meditate,

03:21:53.397 --> 03:21:58.097
focusing on these things that are on my body,

03:21:58.097 --> 03:22:01.784
and seeing if I can just like,

03:22:01.784 --> 03:22:03.967
get a hunch in my brain.

03:22:03.967 --> 03:22:08.280
Get a feeling of a good spot to anchor to.

03:22:09.837 --> 03:22:11.287
LIAM: I'm going to throw the dome up over us

03:22:11.287 --> 03:22:13.197
so we don't get drenched.

03:22:13.197 --> 03:22:14.100
MARISHA: While we walk?

03:22:15.057 --> 03:22:17.517
LIAM: You're going to meditate and walk at the same time?

03:22:17.517 --> 03:22:19.057
MARISHA: Well, I'm going to find a place.

03:22:19.057 --> 03:22:20.357
LIAM: Okay.
MARISHA: And then, yeah.

03:22:21.607 --> 03:22:22.607
LIAM: Okay.
MARISHA: But sure.

03:22:24.747 --> 03:22:28.587
MATT: So you walk for a bit.

03:22:28.587 --> 03:22:30.617
There are a number of patches within the grove

03:22:30.617 --> 03:22:34.440
that are comfortable, soft, long grasses.

03:22:35.767 --> 03:22:38.527
Even some mud patches, especially around

03:22:42.256 --> 03:22:44.217
the grove's watering hole.

03:22:44.217 --> 03:22:46.480
MARISHA: Anything-- get the feeling?

03:22:47.397 --> 03:22:48.270
Connective?

03:22:49.387 --> 03:22:51.637
I find a good spot.

03:22:51.637 --> 03:22:53.207
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: This mud patch,

03:22:53.207 --> 03:22:54.077
does this feel good?

03:22:54.077 --> 03:22:55.727
Just a like grassy knoll.

03:22:56.757 --> 03:22:58.617
TALIESIN: If it's a mud patch, it's probably actually

03:22:58.617 --> 03:23:00.816
somewhere where someone was interred.
MARISHA: Ugh.

03:23:00.816 --> 03:23:02.147
TALIESIN: So I'm going to just look at the stone.

03:23:02.147 --> 03:23:03.077
I didn't say that to you,

03:23:03.077 --> 03:23:05.177
I'm going to look at the stone and see

03:23:05.177 --> 03:23:07.387
if perhaps this was a worshiper of Ioun

03:23:07.387 --> 03:23:08.510
or anything like that.

03:23:11.667 --> 03:23:13.357
MATT: You would, you know this area pretty well.

03:23:13.357 --> 03:23:15.567
And you know, specifically, there are a handful

03:23:15.567 --> 03:23:17.434
of individuals that were interred here as followers of Ioun

03:23:17.434 --> 03:23:18.907
and it's easy for you to steer her

03:23:18.907 --> 03:23:20.847
towards one that has some solid ground.

03:23:20.847 --> 03:23:22.130
TALIESIN: Right, try this.

03:23:22.130 --> 03:23:23.397
MARISHA: This grassy knoll?

03:23:23.397 --> 03:23:24.407
TALIESIN: If it feels good.

03:23:24.407 --> 03:23:25.650
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

03:23:27.597 --> 03:23:28.807
I don't know what I'm doing.

03:23:28.807 --> 03:23:30.460
This isn't normally my jam.

03:23:32.657 --> 03:23:34.747
I'm going to see what happens.

03:23:34.747 --> 03:23:36.057
TALIESIN: I'm backing up.

03:23:36.057 --> 03:23:37.410
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: See ya.

03:23:38.967 --> 03:23:40.257
LAURA: Bye, Beau.

03:23:40.257 --> 03:23:42.417
MARISHA: I'm going to sit down.

03:23:42.417 --> 03:23:45.757
I'm going to stare at this symbol of Ioun

03:23:45.757 --> 03:23:49.937
that is carved into this grave marker,

03:23:49.937 --> 03:23:54.070
and just lose myself in the intricate carvings

03:23:54.070 --> 03:23:57.977
and how deep the recesses seem to go

03:23:57.977 --> 03:24:02.967
in all of these carved marks, and the illusion

03:24:03.988 --> 03:24:08.367
of if it's recessed or if it is carved,

03:24:08.367 --> 03:24:12.305
and it is protruding outwards,

03:24:12.305 --> 03:24:16.227
and try and meditate and see if I can get some sort of

03:24:16.227 --> 03:24:20.297
connection to somebody who might give me

03:24:20.297 --> 03:24:24.637
some sort of an answer, or an advantage,

03:24:24.637 --> 03:24:29.584
on what I can do with these eyes that are on my body.

03:24:29.584 --> 03:24:31.407
MATT: Okay.

03:24:31.407 --> 03:24:32.757
Go ahead and roll a d20 for me and add

03:24:32.757 --> 03:24:34.897
your wisdom modifier.

03:24:34.897 --> 03:24:37.100
TALIESIN: The Wild Mother assists you.

03:24:37.100 --> 03:24:39.157
(laughs)

03:24:39.157 --> 03:24:41.057
MARISHA: Just my wisdom modifier.
MATT: Correct.

03:24:43.327 --> 03:24:44.625
MARISHA: Lucky jade.

03:24:44.625 --> 03:24:46.340
TRAVIS: It's going to be that gopher sitting on a fence.

03:24:46.340 --> 03:24:47.407
(yelling)

03:24:48.257 --> 03:24:49.090
LIAM: Did you do it?

03:24:50.577 --> 03:24:53.287
MARISHA: I picked it up really fast because it went out,

03:24:53.287 --> 03:24:54.537
but it's a 20!

03:24:54.537 --> 03:24:55.987
SAM: Whoa.
TALIESIN: That's the 20 face.

03:24:55.987 --> 03:24:56.937
I know the 20 face.

03:24:58.587 --> 03:25:00.367
MARISHA: Can I keep it?

03:25:00.367 --> 03:25:01.610
Can I take it home?

03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:04.648
MATT: You were picking it up to re-roll it.

03:25:04.648 --> 03:25:05.486
MARISHA: Okay.

03:25:05.486 --> 03:25:06.836
LIAM: Zig-a-zig-ah.

03:25:07.831 --> 03:25:09.947
MARISHA: And it still bounced out.

03:25:09.947 --> 03:25:11.937
Should I keep that one?

03:25:11.937 --> 03:25:12.770
It's good.

03:25:13.657 --> 03:25:15.807
MATT: What is it?
MARISHA: It's a seven.

03:25:15.807 --> 03:25:20.360
With my wisdom modifier, which is plus four, so 11.

03:25:20.360 --> 03:25:22.873
MATT: 11?
MARISHA: But the first one was a 20.

03:25:22.873 --> 03:25:23.873
MATT: It was.

03:25:23.873 --> 03:25:28.814
I'm just going by the intent of re-rolling.

03:25:30.197 --> 03:25:32.148
TALIESIN: Never touch.
MARISHA: Shouldn't touch it.

03:25:35.537 --> 03:25:39.527
MATT: As you stare into this symbol of Ioun before you,

03:25:39.527 --> 03:25:41.397
and focus, and concentrate,

03:25:41.397 --> 03:25:45.497
in trying to extend your consciousness

03:25:45.497 --> 03:25:47.687
in the way that you hear other people do

03:25:47.687 --> 03:25:52.687
to gods and deities and powers for guidance.

03:25:52.887 --> 03:25:53.900
For information.

03:25:55.757 --> 03:25:57.607
And you look into this symbol of Ioun.

03:25:57.607 --> 03:26:00.820
A symbol you've seen a lot of your adult life.

03:26:01.907 --> 03:26:04.080
A familiar symbol of three eyes.

03:26:07.387 --> 03:26:09.564
You just focus on that top one.

03:26:12.137 --> 03:26:15.300
You focus, and the sound of the rain,

03:26:18.467 --> 03:26:19.890
gets quieter and quieter.

03:26:20.737 --> 03:26:23.050
The cold begins to turn to numbness.

03:26:25.237 --> 03:26:29.677
The sense of location, of self, begins to drift

03:26:29.677 --> 03:26:30.510
and disseminate,

03:26:33.717 --> 03:26:35.610
like diffused liquid and water.

03:26:38.663 --> 03:26:40.738
And all you can see is that top eye.

03:26:44.997 --> 03:26:47.100
You blink, and it's red,

03:26:49.617 --> 03:26:50.500
and a voice goes,

03:26:54.584 --> 03:26:56.542
(as Lucien) "Well, if this isn't unexpected.

03:26:59.544 --> 03:27:01.644
"Looks like the children are all growing up.

03:27:05.676 --> 03:27:06.509
"Well,

03:27:09.484 --> 03:27:12.081
"what do you want?

03:27:12.081 --> 03:27:14.447
"You're the one who reached out to me."

03:27:17.317 --> 03:27:18.963
You hear Lucien's voice.

03:27:23.387 --> 03:27:25.387
LIAM: I'm just looking at the side of her head.

03:27:25.387 --> 03:27:27.477
MARISHA: Do you have like a manager that I can speak to?

03:27:27.477 --> 03:27:29.320
I wasn't trying to contact you.

03:27:30.284 --> 03:27:31.984
MATT: "Well, too bad.

03:27:31.984 --> 03:27:33.717
"You found me."

03:27:33.717 --> 03:27:35.557
MARISHA: Yeah, I didn't know you
were going to be at this party

03:27:35.557 --> 03:27:37.011
or else I wouldn't have come.

03:27:37.011 --> 03:27:38.602
LIAM: <i>Scheiße</i>.

03:27:39.994 --> 03:27:42.702
MATT: "You don't have to be rude about it."

03:27:49.987 --> 03:27:52.129
MARISHA: What are you guys up to, I guess?

03:27:52.129 --> 03:27:55.781
(laughter)

03:27:55.781 --> 03:27:57.477
TRAVIS: Is this out loud or is it in her head?

03:27:57.477 --> 03:27:59.310
Come on, I got to know!

03:28:01.350 --> 03:28:04.508
LIAM: I've copped to it being Lucien two sentences ago.

03:28:04.508 --> 03:28:07.547
(laughter)

03:28:07.547 --> 03:28:09.383
MATT: From your guys' perspective,

03:28:10.607 --> 03:28:12.307
she is just staring at the symbol.

03:28:12.307 --> 03:28:13.445
LIAM: Oh, she's not talking out loud?

03:28:13.445 --> 03:28:14.877
MATT: She's not talking out loud.

03:28:14.877 --> 03:28:19.467
She is not-- at least she's not physically

03:28:19.467 --> 03:28:21.143
speaking these things.

03:28:23.984 --> 03:28:25.767
"Now to your sudden...

03:28:29.514 --> 03:28:30.730
"we'll say,

03:28:32.694 --> 03:28:35.864
"follow up on our excursion,

03:28:35.864 --> 03:28:39.354
"left us a bit in a lurch, so we had to double time it.

03:28:39.354 --> 03:28:42.914
"But we're keeping a schedule.

03:28:42.914 --> 03:28:44.351
"How about you?"

03:28:45.907 --> 03:28:49.617
MARISHA: Oh, you know, stretching our legs,

03:28:49.617 --> 03:28:52.927
seeing the sights, taking the scenic route.

03:28:52.927 --> 03:28:54.877
You know, just having a grand old time.

03:28:56.184 --> 03:28:58.209
MATT: "Great, great."
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:28:59.584 --> 03:29:00.642
MATT: "Well."

03:29:06.177 --> 03:29:07.010
MARISHA: Yes?

03:29:08.777 --> 03:29:11.279
MATT: The silence pauses for a moment and,

03:29:12.961 --> 03:29:17.000
"(sighing) You can see quite a bit with two eyes.

03:29:18.704 --> 03:29:22.147
"Imagine what you can see with three."

03:29:22.147 --> 03:29:24.837
And you focus on the symbol of Ioun with the three eyes

03:29:24.837 --> 03:29:25.912
and all three eyes--
MARISHA: I cut.

03:29:25.912 --> 03:29:28.007
MATT: --are glowing red.
MARISHA: Can I cut away?

03:29:28.007 --> 03:29:29.332
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

03:29:29.332 --> 03:29:31.548
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:29:31.548 --> 03:29:34.450
MARISHA: ♪ Here's where I want that natural 20 ♪

03:29:34.450 --> 03:29:36.898
♪ It's another fucking seven ♪

03:29:36.898 --> 03:29:38.451
(laughter)

03:29:38.451 --> 03:29:40.106
11.
MATT: You can't break away.

03:29:40.106 --> 03:29:41.439
LAURA: Oh no!

03:29:42.407 --> 03:29:43.669
MARISHA: Oh, wait, a saving throw?

03:29:43.669 --> 03:29:45.487
MATT: Saving throw, yeah.
MARISHA: A saving throw.

03:29:45.487 --> 03:29:49.934
That is different, 'cause my wisdom is plus nine.

03:29:49.934 --> 03:29:50.767
SAM: Damn.

03:29:52.381 --> 03:29:53.708
ASHLEY: 16?
MARISHA: And I can also--

03:29:53.708 --> 03:29:54.841
TRAVIS: Your wisdom is plus nine?

03:29:54.841 --> 03:29:56.857
LAURA: Mine is a plus 10 on my saving throws.

03:29:56.857 --> 03:29:59.927
MARISHA: And I can spend a ki
point to re-roll saving throws.

03:29:59.927 --> 03:30:01.287
Can I do that right now?

03:30:01.287 --> 03:30:02.737
MATT: That's a monk thing?

03:30:02.737 --> 03:30:04.223
MARISHA: Diamond Soul!
SAM: Monk thing.

03:30:04.223 --> 03:30:05.848
TALIESIN: Oh!
MATT: That's right.

03:30:05.848 --> 03:30:06.714
LAURA: You can re-roll what?

03:30:06.714 --> 03:30:08.917
You can re-roll what?
TRAVIS: Broken ass monks.

03:30:08.917 --> 03:30:09.750
MATT: Monks, yo.

03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:11.462
LAURA: You can re-roll saving throws?

03:30:11.462 --> 03:30:12.777
MARISHA: If I spend a ki point.

03:30:12.777 --> 03:30:14.198
LAURA: Of course you can.

03:30:14.198 --> 03:30:16.077
MATT: (laughs)

03:30:16.077 --> 03:30:17.067
TRAVIS: How many ki points do you have now?

03:30:17.067 --> 03:30:20.501
MARISHA: 14, one per level.
LAURA: So basically monks just have endless luck?

03:30:20.501 --> 03:30:22.415
That's what it is?
LIAM: Ki points!

03:30:22.415 --> 03:30:24.734
LAURA: Monks just get luck.

03:30:24.734 --> 03:30:26.017
MARISHA: Can I do it?

03:30:26.017 --> 03:30:28.037
MATT: She can do it once for a saving throw

03:30:28.037 --> 03:30:29.427
with a ki point if she has one left over.

03:30:29.427 --> 03:30:30.260
You can do it.

03:30:31.142 --> 03:30:32.505
MARISHA: Ha ha, it's better!

03:30:33.673 --> 03:30:34.506
Yeah.

03:30:35.513 --> 03:30:38.827
27, nope, sorry, 25.
TALIESIN: Whoa.

03:30:38.827 --> 03:30:41.157
MATT: 25, as you try and pull away

03:30:41.157 --> 03:30:44.530
and you feel something holding you there.

03:30:45.537 --> 03:30:47.887
You can't see anything, all you see is the red eyes

03:30:47.887 --> 03:30:51.427
and you can feel him speaking into your mind.

03:30:51.427 --> 03:30:52.937
And as soon as you try and pull away,

03:30:52.937 --> 03:30:54.102
it's like someone's grabbing your head

03:30:54.102 --> 03:30:56.367
and holding it in place.

03:30:56.367 --> 03:30:58.397
And as you feel the tension there,

03:30:58.397 --> 03:31:02.169
you break away and all at once,

03:31:02.169 --> 03:31:03.647
the rain is around you again,

03:31:03.647 --> 03:31:05.457
that cold sensation rushes back to you.

03:31:05.457 --> 03:31:09.417
And you're in the low-lit exterior

03:31:09.417 --> 03:31:10.554
of the Grove once more.

03:31:10.554 --> 03:31:12.618
You both watches as Beauregard suddenly just goes,

03:31:12.618 --> 03:31:14.942
(grunts) off to the side.

03:31:14.942 --> 03:31:17.356
MARISHA: (groaning) He's such a cock.

03:31:18.781 --> 03:31:21.437
TALIESIN: I mean, I didn't bury this particular person,

03:31:21.437 --> 03:31:22.567
so I can't comment on that.

03:31:22.567 --> 03:31:25.099
MARISHA: Oh, I'm not talking about Ulysses, sorry.

03:31:25.099 --> 03:31:26.927
TALIESIN: Oh.
MARISHA: Yeah, he seems cool.

03:31:26.927 --> 03:31:29.010
I don't know, I didn't talk to him.

03:31:30.260 --> 03:31:31.877
LIAM: Who'd you talk to?

03:31:31.877 --> 03:31:34.125
MARISHA: Fucking Lucien.

03:31:36.107 --> 03:31:37.340
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:31:38.997 --> 03:31:42.308
MARISHA: I don't know, he didn't seem to--

03:31:43.347 --> 03:31:45.046
in fact, he was like, "Mm, where are you?

03:31:45.046 --> 03:31:45.879
"What are you doing?"

03:31:45.879 --> 03:31:49.937
He didn't seem to make any type

03:31:49.937 --> 03:31:51.707
of hints that he knew where we were,

03:31:51.707 --> 03:31:54.587
that he could see us--
LIAM: So you butt dialed him.

03:31:54.587 --> 03:31:56.476
MARISHA: Yeah, well, I wasn't trying to get to him,

03:31:56.476 --> 03:31:57.625
but I guess--

03:31:58.501 --> 03:32:00.633
LIAM: That's a butt dial.

03:32:00.633 --> 03:32:02.395
MATT: Make an arcana check.

03:32:02.395 --> 03:32:05.240
LIAM: Arcana check for butt dial.

03:32:05.240 --> 03:32:06.429
Oh, so low.

03:32:07.287 --> 03:32:08.567
So low!

03:32:08.567 --> 03:32:10.297
15.
MATT: 15.

03:32:10.297 --> 03:32:11.697
LIAM: Rolled a four.

03:32:11.697 --> 03:32:13.207
MATT: The best that you can glean from

03:32:13.207 --> 03:32:15.257
this weird circumstance is, yeah,

03:32:15.257 --> 03:32:17.337
these protect you from divination--

03:32:17.337 --> 03:32:18.787
LIAM: But not talking.
MATT: Inward.

03:32:19.877 --> 03:32:21.427
But if someone reaches outward,

03:32:23.897 --> 03:32:25.307
it's not going to have much of an effect.

03:32:25.307 --> 03:32:27.071
TRAVIS: You've got the touch!

03:32:28.117 --> 03:32:31.197
LIAM: Would have been way more fun to fail that save.

03:32:31.197 --> 03:32:32.735
MATT: Oh, I was waiting on it.

03:32:32.735 --> 03:32:34.175
(laughs)

03:32:34.175 --> 03:32:35.681
ASHLEY: Oh no no, no no no.

03:32:35.681 --> 03:32:38.267
LIAM: Take that ki point, just rip it up and throw it away.

03:32:38.267 --> 03:32:39.967
TRAVIS: Now you've only got two eyes.

03:32:39.967 --> 03:32:41.677
MARISHA: Yeah, oof.

03:32:41.677 --> 03:32:42.510
LAURA: Lame.

03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:45.167
MARISHA: Stupid.
LIAM: We all have two eyes.

03:32:45.167 --> 03:32:46.480
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)

03:32:46.480 --> 03:32:47.597
TALIESIN: Collect them all.

03:32:50.327 --> 03:32:51.160
MARISHA: Well--

03:32:52.237 --> 03:32:53.870
LIAM: Did you find anything of use?

03:32:56.517 --> 03:32:58.777
MARISHA: No.
LIAM: Just that he's a cock,

03:32:58.777 --> 03:33:00.348
which was information that we--

03:33:00.348 --> 03:33:02.230
MARISHA: We already knew.
LIAM: --had, yeah.

03:33:03.167 --> 03:33:05.110
TALIESIN: Why did you break away so harshly?

03:33:07.327 --> 03:33:09.752
MARISHA: He was trying to put another eye on me.

03:33:11.527 --> 03:33:15.002
He was like "Mm, here, have another, nyah nyah."

03:33:16.780 --> 03:33:19.265
TALIESIN: I'm going to just check out the

03:33:20.169 --> 03:33:21.667
symbol of Ioun on the stone

03:33:21.667 --> 03:33:23.907
and make sure it's okay.

03:33:23.907 --> 03:33:26.457
MATT: Unchanged from all the time that you've known it.

03:33:28.097 --> 03:33:29.705
TALIESIN: That's rude.

03:33:29.705 --> 03:33:31.445
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:33:31.445 --> 03:33:32.803
TALIESIN: You okay?

03:33:35.143 --> 03:33:36.847
MARISHA: (sighs)

03:33:36.847 --> 03:33:39.730
TALIESIN: Actually, do you mind checking?

03:33:41.897 --> 03:33:42.730
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:33:43.617 --> 03:33:46.327
Can you bring the globules over?

03:33:46.327 --> 03:33:48.318
LIAM: They just float over.

03:33:48.318 --> 03:33:49.151
MARISHA: Anything?
MATT: Make a

03:33:49.151 --> 03:33:50.702
perception or investigation check,

03:33:50.702 --> 03:33:52.787
your choice.
TALIESIN: Pff! (laughs)

03:33:52.787 --> 03:33:55.777
Perception it is, and I will give myself a little kick

03:33:55.777 --> 03:33:57.627
because I don't want to miss nothing.

03:33:59.167 --> 03:34:01.020
Oh, well, that's nice.

03:34:02.147 --> 03:34:04.877
Perception, why do I even look?

03:34:04.877 --> 03:34:05.780
31.

03:34:05.780 --> 03:34:07.397
LAURA and LIAM: (impressed noises)

03:34:07.397 --> 03:34:08.667
SAM: Pretty good, pretty good.

03:34:08.667 --> 03:34:11.007
MATT: Pretty solid once over on Beauregard,

03:34:11.007 --> 03:34:13.174
you do not notice an additional eye.

03:34:14.432 --> 03:34:16.357
TALIESIN: Unless it's somewhere really inappropriate

03:34:16.357 --> 03:34:17.877
that I don't really want to go looking in,

03:34:17.877 --> 03:34:20.019
I think you're fine.
SAM: Yeah.

03:34:20.019 --> 03:34:22.170
MARISHA: I'll have Yasha tell me later if she sees anything.

03:34:22.170 --> 03:34:23.655
TALIESIN: Oh man, that makes me so happy.

03:34:23.655 --> 03:34:26.244
LAURA and MARISHA: (fake laughter)

03:34:26.244 --> 03:34:28.376
TALIESIN: One date's great, but like,

03:34:28.376 --> 03:34:30.401
you need to keep going.

03:34:32.398 --> 03:34:33.907
MARISHA: What, with Yasha?

03:34:33.907 --> 03:34:36.167
TALIESIN: Yeah, like, just, you
know, just a little bit everyday.

03:34:36.167 --> 03:34:37.787
Just got to work at it.

03:34:38.767 --> 03:34:39.847
So I'm told.

03:34:39.847 --> 03:34:42.042
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.
TALIESIN: Oh, you know.

03:34:42.042 --> 03:34:43.697
MARISHA: I wasn't expecting a little relationship advice

03:34:43.697 --> 03:34:44.954
in the middle of this conversation.

03:34:44.954 --> 03:34:46.627
TALIESIN: I really shouldn't give it. I'm just so excited.

03:34:46.627 --> 03:34:47.887
MARISHA: No, I'm here for it.
TALIESIN: All right.

03:34:47.887 --> 03:34:51.287
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, you give great advice, genuinely.

03:34:51.287 --> 03:34:52.807
LIAM: You know, I think we might be past

03:34:52.807 --> 03:34:54.775
the point of fact finding.

03:34:55.945 --> 03:34:58.278
I think it might be time to go to bed.

03:34:59.497 --> 03:35:04.223
Rip the bandaid off, and do what we have to do.

03:35:05.467 --> 03:35:07.267
TALIESIN: I'm ready.

03:35:07.267 --> 03:35:09.387
LIAM: Well, I am not, but there's only

03:35:09.387 --> 03:35:11.224
so much procrastinating we can do,

03:35:11.224 --> 03:35:13.390
and we're running out of time.

03:35:13.390 --> 03:35:15.777
TALIESIN: I'll be ready after breakfast.

03:35:15.777 --> 03:35:16.957
Would you mind...

03:35:18.337 --> 03:35:22.157
Can you wire-- can you do the wire?

03:35:22.157 --> 03:35:22.990
LIAM: Your home?

03:35:23.877 --> 03:35:26.660
TALIESIN: Just in case he figured out where we are.

03:35:27.647 --> 03:35:28.560
LIAM: I can.

03:35:30.947 --> 03:35:33.167
I mean, he's going to be bearing down on us

03:35:34.947 --> 03:35:38.514
the moment the wire is tripped, but I can.

03:35:38.514 --> 03:35:41.357
TALIESIN: At least we'll wake up as opposed to last time.

03:35:41.357 --> 03:35:44.507
LIAM: Okay, we'll make it ring the bell, sure.

03:35:48.740 --> 03:35:49.573
MARISHA: Okay.

03:35:50.910 --> 03:35:51.760
LIAM: Terrible thing.

03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:54.780
TALIESIN: Let's go sleep and have a good breakfast.

03:35:56.760 --> 03:35:57.593
MATT: Okay.

03:35:59.059 --> 03:36:01.460
You all return to the home and the

03:36:01.460 --> 03:36:04.870
main entryway/general living space

03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:07.010
of the front part of the temple

03:36:07.010 --> 03:36:10.720
has become an open slumber party floor.

03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:13.030
There are blankets and pillows

03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:14.760
and satchels and sacks.

03:36:14.760 --> 03:36:17.100
Anything that could be considered comfortable--

03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:20.990
more comfortable than a general flat, hard floor--

03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:23.140
placed about and

03:36:23.140 --> 03:36:24.840
ready for you all to rest for the night.

03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:26.020
Is there anything anybody would like to do

03:36:26.020 --> 03:36:27.465
before you go to bed?

03:36:28.980 --> 03:36:31.630
LAURA: Oh yeah, you're probably going to go outside too.

03:36:31.630 --> 03:36:32.868
ASHLEY: Let's go.

03:36:32.868 --> 03:36:34.750
I kind of want to--

03:36:34.750 --> 03:36:36.556
can I go pick a flower out there?

03:36:36.556 --> 03:36:37.514
TALIESIN: I gave you permission.

03:36:37.514 --> 03:36:38.790
ASHLEY: Yeah?

03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:40.007
Anywhere, or just the--

03:36:40.007 --> 03:36:40.962
TALIESIN: Hmm?

03:36:42.111 --> 03:36:43.740
As long as you leave one and most of them

03:36:43.740 --> 03:36:45.180
have way more than one.

03:36:45.180 --> 03:36:47.320
And if there's one that only has one,

03:36:47.320 --> 03:36:49.350
then you shouldn't touch it.

03:36:49.350 --> 03:36:50.900
They're definitely not all edible

03:36:50.900 --> 03:36:53.640
and I said that if you get a bad feeling about one,

03:36:53.640 --> 03:36:55.320
then don't take it.

03:36:55.320 --> 03:36:56.860
And look at the name.

03:36:56.860 --> 03:36:58.505
Or at least look at what's on the rock.

03:36:58.505 --> 03:37:00.760
Because not all of them have names.

03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:02.830
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: (laughs)

03:37:02.830 --> 03:37:05.230
MARISHA: There's a lot of instructions for picking a flower.

03:37:05.230 --> 03:37:06.460
ASHLEY: It is, it is, it is.

03:37:06.460 --> 03:37:07.751
All right.

03:37:07.751 --> 03:37:09.240
I'll go for a little bit, I'll be back.

03:37:09.240 --> 03:37:10.073
LAURA: I imagine that

03:37:11.255 --> 03:37:13.230
Fjord and I are not inside.

03:37:13.230 --> 03:37:16.190
I wanted to go for a walk around and look at all the

03:37:16.190 --> 03:37:17.540
glowing crystals and

03:37:18.540 --> 03:37:21.120
the lichen and all that kind of fun stuff around.

03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:23.050
Not going into the scary part of the woods

03:37:23.050 --> 03:37:24.780
but just walking around the grounds.

03:37:24.780 --> 03:37:25.613
MATT: Fair enough. Easy.

03:37:25.613 --> 03:37:27.370
The grounds themselves are pretty comfortable.

03:37:27.370 --> 03:37:29.590
It's beyond them,

03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:32.440
beyond the exterior fence where things get really creepy.

03:37:33.430 --> 03:37:34.330
Easy enough to do.

03:37:35.970 --> 03:37:38.840
LIAM: This is the last save before the boss fight, guys.

03:37:38.840 --> 03:37:40.721
So get all your stuff out.
MARISHA: I know, it does feel like it.

03:37:40.721 --> 03:37:42.190
LIAM: I have something as well.

03:37:42.190 --> 03:37:44.670
I'm just putting it on the list.

03:37:44.670 --> 03:37:46.040
MATT: All righty.

03:37:46.040 --> 03:37:47.635
All righty.

03:37:47.635 --> 03:37:48.468
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

03:37:48.468 --> 03:37:51.018
MATT: The two of you walk out into the now pouring rain.

03:37:51.018 --> 03:37:51.851
LAURA: Yeah.

03:37:54.281 --> 03:37:58.550
Hey, it's like we're standing in the ocean, it's so wet.

03:37:58.550 --> 03:38:01.400
That's stupid. That's dumb. Let's just--

03:38:01.400 --> 03:38:03.590
TRAVIS: Like on the deck of a ship, because--

03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:05.840
LAURA: Yeah, that's way better, that's way better.

03:38:06.920 --> 03:38:09.450
As we're walking, I just want to

03:38:12.330 --> 03:38:13.500
tell Fjord about

03:38:15.780 --> 03:38:18.733
the talk I had with my mama.

03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:26.400
You know, I told her we were--

03:38:29.570 --> 03:38:32.020
She made me tell her that I would come back

03:38:32.020 --> 03:38:33.820
if things got scary.

03:38:33.820 --> 03:38:36.453
It reminded me of the conversation that we had.

03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:42.513
I lied to her, Fjord.

03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:48.370
I promised her I would, that I would turn around

03:38:48.370 --> 03:38:49.970
and come back if things got bad.

03:38:52.981 --> 03:38:54.573
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:38:56.380 --> 03:38:57.480
Why did you do that?

03:38:58.590 --> 03:39:00.190
LAURA: Because I want her to be happy.

03:39:02.767 --> 03:39:04.317
I don't know. I didn't want to--

03:39:07.183 --> 03:39:09.340
I didn't want to make her cry.

03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:11.573
Because who knows, we might come back, you know?

03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:13.353
TRAVIS: We could.

03:39:14.330 --> 03:39:15.954
<i>I'm</i> counting on it.

03:39:15.954 --> 03:39:16.787
LAURA: I know.

03:39:19.430 --> 03:39:20.263
Just...

03:39:21.400 --> 03:39:26.400
you know, I got to see my mama and my papa together and

03:39:26.490 --> 03:39:28.200
it was pretty great and

03:39:30.540 --> 03:39:31.950
they seem happy and

03:39:33.980 --> 03:39:35.430
it just had me thinking that

03:39:39.680 --> 03:39:41.453
you never got to talk to Vandran.

03:39:46.350 --> 03:39:47.183
TRAVIS: No.

03:39:53.240 --> 03:39:54.890
All the more reason to come home.

03:39:55.820 --> 03:39:57.440
LAURA: Yeah.

03:39:57.440 --> 03:39:58.340
TRAVIS: How did it feel?

03:39:59.490 --> 03:40:00.323
LAURA: Seeing them?

03:40:00.323 --> 03:40:01.473
TRAVIS: Yeah, together.

03:40:05.500 --> 03:40:07.650
LAURA: It was kind of like one of my storybooks.

03:40:11.020 --> 03:40:12.530
I always had this dream that

03:40:14.060 --> 03:40:18.420
he would come back to the Lavish Chateau someday, and

03:40:18.420 --> 03:40:20.590
he'd walk through the door, and

03:40:20.590 --> 03:40:22.930
Mama would see him in the middle of one of her shows

03:40:22.930 --> 03:40:25.610
and she'd stop singing and rush off the stage

03:40:25.610 --> 03:40:27.403
and jump into his arms.

03:40:30.430 --> 03:40:32.630
And it wasn't quite that, but

03:40:35.690 --> 03:40:38.060
you know, I saw his eyes when

03:40:38.060 --> 03:40:39.885
he saw her for the first time and

03:40:42.590 --> 03:40:43.763
that was pretty great.

03:40:45.550 --> 03:40:47.370
TRAVIS: He seems very nervous around her.

03:40:47.370 --> 03:40:48.739
LAURA: Yeah.

03:40:48.739 --> 03:40:50.197
Well, he has a lot to--

03:40:52.123 --> 03:40:54.470
He's got a lot to account for.

03:40:54.470 --> 03:40:55.310
TRAVIS: For sure.

03:40:55.310 --> 03:40:56.423
Nervous is good.

03:40:57.780 --> 03:40:59.540
Cocky and carefree, not so great.

03:40:59.540 --> 03:41:00.553
Nervous is good.

03:41:01.710 --> 03:41:03.555
Means he cares.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:41:05.880 --> 03:41:08.850
Did you want me to send a message to Vandran?

03:41:09.973 --> 03:41:11.123
TRAVIS: (sighs)
LAURA: I'd do it.

03:41:14.506 --> 03:41:15.339
TRAVIS: No.

03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:18.393
No.

03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:21.270
LAURA: Do you want me to scry on him?

03:41:22.460 --> 03:41:23.963
So you can at least know?

03:41:27.570 --> 03:41:30.021
TRAVIS: No, because I'm going to see him.

03:41:30.021 --> 03:41:30.979
LAURA: Okay.

03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:33.163
TRAVIS: I know it.

03:41:35.770 --> 03:41:37.320
And if for some reason I don't,

03:41:39.520 --> 03:41:40.933
he's found his peace.

03:41:42.800 --> 03:41:44.400
I would never want to ruin that.

03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:47.733
LAURA: Okay.

03:41:48.910 --> 03:41:50.291
TRAVIS: But thank you.

03:41:50.291 --> 03:41:51.291
LAURA: Of course.

03:41:56.765 --> 03:41:57.940
TRAVIS: We're coming back.

03:42:02.380 --> 03:42:03.213
LAURA: Yeah.

03:42:04.701 --> 03:42:05.959
We're going to win.

03:42:07.170 --> 03:42:09.740
We're going to destroy a god city!

03:42:09.740 --> 03:42:10.765
TRAVIS: We're going to tear it apart

03:42:10.765 --> 03:42:12.756
and float through the Astral Sea!

03:42:12.756 --> 03:42:14.599
LAURA: We're going to be amazing!

03:42:14.599 --> 03:42:17.819
TRAVIS: Then find a way to come back.

03:42:17.819 --> 03:42:21.460
LAURA: And then we're going to see Vandran!

03:42:21.460 --> 03:42:23.421
TRAVIS: I mean-- yes. Yes.

03:42:23.421 --> 03:42:24.504
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:28.543
LAURA: Okay.

03:42:28.543 --> 03:42:31.480
I just wanted to check.

03:42:31.480 --> 03:42:32.810
You can hold my hand now.

03:42:32.810 --> 03:42:34.358
TRAVIS: I'm holding your hand.
LAURA: Okay.

03:42:34.358 --> 03:42:36.497
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:42:36.497 --> 03:42:39.348
I'm checking you out.
LAURA: I'm checking you out!

03:42:39.348 --> 03:42:41.931
(laughter)

03:42:47.220 --> 03:42:48.513
LAURA: We'll head back.
MATT: Okay.

03:42:50.918 --> 03:42:52.025
Caleb, you said you had something you wanted to do?

03:42:52.025 --> 03:42:54.390
LIAM: I do. My shit's by myself.

03:42:54.390 --> 03:42:55.440
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Is that okay?

03:42:55.440 --> 03:42:57.080
MATT: Of course.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:42:57.080 --> 03:42:58.790
In fact, I don't want to be interrupted,

03:42:58.790 --> 03:43:02.140
so I'm going to cast Greater Invisibility on myself and

03:43:02.140 --> 03:43:04.190
take a walk away from the Clays' house.

03:43:06.180 --> 03:43:09.230
I'm going to go through the rain down to the edge

03:43:09.230 --> 03:43:11.360
to where it's safe and I'm going to put up the dome

03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:12.820
for myself

03:43:12.820 --> 03:43:15.583
and once it's up-- it takes a little bit--

03:43:18.050 --> 03:43:20.650
I'm going to lay out a long stretch of leather

03:43:20.650 --> 03:43:24.593
in front of me and bring out Frumpkin.

03:43:26.253 --> 03:43:27.460
MATT: (meows)

03:43:27.460 --> 03:43:29.457
Hello.
MATT: (meows)

03:43:29.457 --> 03:43:31.257
LIAM: Yeah, spend some time with me, okay?

03:43:32.940 --> 03:43:34.690
And I start to do that thing

03:43:34.690 --> 03:43:37.600
where I bring out every object that I have,

03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:39.600
carefully, one at a time,

03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:42.670
and put them neatly in neat little rows

03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:44.730
so I can see everything in its place

03:43:44.730 --> 03:43:46.370
and talk to Frumpkin

03:43:47.630 --> 03:43:48.580
while I'm doing it.

03:43:52.717 --> 03:43:54.630
(exhales)

03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:55.473
Oh buddy boy.

03:43:56.806 --> 03:43:57.772
MATT: (meows)

03:43:57.772 --> 03:44:00.952
LIAM: This is like the beginning with us.

03:44:02.220 --> 03:44:03.170
For one more night.

03:44:04.514 --> 03:44:06.500
MATT: (meows)

03:44:06.500 --> 03:44:09.340
LIAM: Yeah. For years, it was just you and me

03:44:09.340 --> 03:44:10.493
before we added one.

03:44:12.355 --> 03:44:15.746
Then we added more and it turned into nein.

03:44:15.746 --> 03:44:17.321
MATT: (affirmative meow)

03:44:20.860 --> 03:44:22.503
LIAM: So many families.

03:44:25.131 --> 03:44:26.523
Continuing to place things.

03:44:28.098 --> 03:44:30.193
You've got such a big family here.

03:44:33.140 --> 03:44:35.358
Veth and her family, and you know,

03:44:35.358 --> 03:44:36.671
all these close ties.

03:44:41.720 --> 03:44:42.835
So much family.

03:44:49.747 --> 03:44:51.780
You know, we're probably all not going to make it back

03:44:51.780 --> 03:44:53.653
from where we're going.

03:44:56.192 --> 03:44:57.025
Probably.

03:44:57.962 --> 03:44:59.703
MATT: (quietly meows)

03:45:02.907 --> 03:45:05.073
LIAM: But maybe we will if we try very hard.

03:45:09.525 --> 03:45:13.358
You and me, we'll do our best to keep families

03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:15.783
together.

03:45:18.840 --> 03:45:20.640
You and me, we'll keep people together

03:45:23.680 --> 03:45:25.680
instead of letting families break apart.

03:45:28.304 --> 03:45:30.637
MATT: (meows, purrs)

03:45:34.840 --> 03:45:36.310
LIAM: You know, I'm going to tell you something.

03:45:36.310 --> 03:45:39.023
All my stuff is already arrayed out before me.

03:45:40.110 --> 03:45:42.440
I take out the smaller of my books

03:45:42.440 --> 03:45:45.100
in the holster and I set it down for a moment

03:45:45.100 --> 03:45:46.053
on a dry spot.

03:45:50.740 --> 03:45:52.313
If we do make it back,

03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:58.278
you've been a good companion all this time.

03:46:01.643 --> 03:46:02.668
Heh.

03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:05.750
Actually, it's a win-win for you because

03:46:07.780 --> 03:46:09.293
if we all die out there,

03:46:11.490 --> 03:46:13.863
you get to go back to where your home is.

03:46:17.210 --> 03:46:18.703
But if we do make it back,

03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:23.376
I'm going to let you go anyway.

03:46:27.400 --> 03:46:28.233
Because

03:46:31.614 --> 03:46:32.523
you're not my cat.

03:46:35.225 --> 03:46:36.770
MATT: (uncertain meow)

03:46:36.770 --> 03:46:37.803
LIAM: My cat is dead.

03:46:43.272 --> 03:46:45.130
But you're a good boy anyway.

03:46:46.973 --> 03:46:49.090
And you've done a lot of good for me.

03:46:49.090 --> 03:46:49.923
So

03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:53.990
one way or another, you'll be free soon.

03:46:57.214 --> 03:46:59.220
MATT: He looks up at you with that

03:46:59.220 --> 03:47:01.603
familiar, affectionate look.

03:47:03.327 --> 03:47:04.160
The eyes

03:47:05.550 --> 03:47:07.810
flash with a sheen of magic green

03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:10.063
for a brief moment.

03:47:13.370 --> 03:47:14.343
Wordlessly,

03:47:16.600 --> 03:47:17.800
you sense understanding.

03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:20.890
LIAM: I put out

03:47:22.130 --> 03:47:25.110
the incense and the herbs that I use to summon him

03:47:27.170 --> 03:47:30.410
and I begin to, while those things percolate and prepare,

03:47:30.410 --> 03:47:33.130
I begin to write a little bit in that other book

03:47:33.130 --> 03:47:34.163
just for a minute.

03:47:36.800 --> 03:47:39.600
And then I bring him over and as

03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:43.299
everything reaches completion,

03:47:43.299 --> 03:47:46.170
I reach out and I scritch him under the neck and

03:47:46.170 --> 03:47:50.550
his fur from where I touch him, starts to spread white

03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:54.500
over his body from the point of contact over

03:47:54.500 --> 03:47:55.333
his whole self,

03:47:55.333 --> 03:47:57.593
and he is a white cat.

03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:04.332
Probably better where we're going.

03:48:04.332 --> 03:48:07.143
MATT: (meows)

03:48:07.143 --> 03:48:09.476
LIAM: (sighs)

03:48:12.300 --> 03:48:15.060
This Stone of Good Luck isn't going to do shit for me

03:48:15.060 --> 03:48:17.230
so I'm going to put that away.

03:48:17.230 --> 03:48:18.830
I'm going to put this ring back on.

03:48:20.910 --> 03:48:22.113
Increase our chances.

03:48:23.578 --> 03:48:25.078
MATT: (meows)

03:48:26.940 --> 03:48:29.313
LIAM: Come here.
MATT: (purring)

03:48:32.310 --> 03:48:33.540
LIAM: Okay so, we

03:48:34.830 --> 03:48:36.480
better head back because what happens next

03:48:36.480 --> 03:48:38.624
is they start do a search

03:48:38.624 --> 03:48:40.910
of the grounds for us thinking we're dead or I've gone off

03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:44.353
to try to talk to a stone eye and contact our nemesis

03:48:44.353 --> 03:48:46.020
or some foolish thing like that.

03:48:46.020 --> 03:48:47.873
So I don't want anyone to be alarmed.

03:48:48.717 --> 03:48:49.942
MATT: (meows)

03:48:54.318 --> 03:48:57.460
LIAM: (sighs)

03:48:57.460 --> 03:48:59.043
All right.

03:48:59.043 --> 03:49:00.393
I'm being foolish, come on.

03:49:01.725 --> 03:49:02.558
MATT: All right.

03:49:02.558 --> 03:49:04.560
Make your way back to the rest of the group.

03:49:04.560 --> 03:49:05.601
LAURA: ♪ Make your way ♪

03:49:05.601 --> 03:49:07.680
MATT: (laughs)

03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:08.513
Anybody else?

03:49:11.390 --> 03:49:13.040
ASHLEY: I'm going to go for a little walk.

03:49:16.076 --> 03:49:16.909
And

03:49:20.477 --> 03:49:23.080
I'd like to see if I can try to find

03:49:23.080 --> 03:49:24.890
a flower that seems

03:49:27.230 --> 03:49:28.063
kind?

03:49:29.370 --> 03:49:31.000
TRAVIS: Kind?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:31.923
And just not--

03:49:34.014 --> 03:49:36.655
that is open for the taking.

03:49:36.655 --> 03:49:38.100
LAURA: (laughs)

03:49:38.100 --> 03:49:40.209
MATT: Make a perception or nature check.
TRAVIS: You get that flower.

03:49:40.209 --> 03:49:41.278
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:49:41.278 --> 03:49:42.111
ASHLEY: Say again?

03:49:42.111 --> 03:49:43.887
LAURA: You take that flower.

03:49:43.887 --> 03:49:44.920
You take it good.

03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:46.170
MATT: Perception or nature, your choice.

03:49:46.170 --> 03:49:47.003
LAURA: Okay.

03:49:50.365 --> 03:49:51.198
18.

03:49:52.810 --> 03:49:53.740
MATT: Not bad.

03:49:53.740 --> 03:49:55.090
ASHLEY: Perception's pretty high.

03:49:59.170 --> 03:50:00.570
MATT: Walking around a bit

03:50:00.570 --> 03:50:02.020
and just strolling through,

03:50:02.020 --> 03:50:04.470
and there's many beautiful flowers in this grove.

03:50:05.480 --> 03:50:07.030
Taken in by all the

03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:09.100
sensory overload of your first arrival here

03:50:09.100 --> 03:50:11.240
at the Blooming Grove, this is the first time

03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:12.640
you've really had to

03:50:13.730 --> 03:50:15.393
take it in in smaller pieces.

03:50:19.270 --> 03:50:21.273
Especially given the limited light.

03:50:22.150 --> 03:50:23.550
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:50:23.550 --> 03:50:26.010
MATT: But light for you is not much of an issue.

03:50:26.010 --> 03:50:28.710
As you can just create your own.

03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:29.543
And as you

03:50:30.500 --> 03:50:34.200
walk around, unveiling the darkness of this grove before you

03:50:34.200 --> 03:50:35.277
the colors pop

03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:40.210
like a kaleidoscope

03:50:40.210 --> 03:50:43.080
that begins to reveal itself from the shadow.

03:50:47.300 --> 03:50:48.570
Eventually, you come upon

03:50:49.860 --> 03:50:52.273
this gentle little lavender flower.

03:50:54.480 --> 03:50:55.730
A cluster of them really.

03:50:56.810 --> 03:50:59.100
But its shape,

03:50:59.100 --> 03:51:00.650
the scent, as you get close,

03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:03.190
that is strong enough to

03:51:03.190 --> 03:51:05.780
come through the cold rain,

03:51:05.780 --> 03:51:07.930
the scent of the storm that's come through.

03:51:08.890 --> 03:51:10.740
It's not a flower you've really seen.

03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:15.780
But it seems welcoming

03:51:15.780 --> 03:51:16.763
as a flower could.

03:51:18.540 --> 03:51:19.373
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:51:20.905 --> 03:51:22.305
I'm going to pick the flower

03:51:24.060 --> 03:51:24.910
and

03:51:27.900 --> 03:51:29.460
find a spot where

03:51:30.580 --> 03:51:32.493
I'm not covered from the rain.

03:51:37.437 --> 03:51:39.180
And I'm going to take off my coat and everything

03:51:39.180 --> 03:51:41.520
so I can just feel it everywhere and

03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:47.393
I'm going to take out--

03:51:52.030 --> 03:51:54.063
I had taken, a long time ago,

03:51:56.840 --> 03:52:00.400
some petrified bark

03:52:00.400 --> 03:52:01.830
that the Storm Lord had

03:52:03.770 --> 03:52:04.770
taken down the tree.

03:52:06.020 --> 03:52:07.670
So I'm going to take that out

03:52:10.970 --> 03:52:11.880
and

03:52:14.170 --> 03:52:16.200
I'm going to eat a petal of the flower

03:52:22.930 --> 03:52:26.563
and sit there and hold the bark and just trace it.

03:52:40.540 --> 03:52:44.303
I feel like this is the closest that I've ever been to you.

03:52:51.260 --> 03:52:52.268
I feel like I

03:52:53.190 --> 03:52:55.720
know so many people that have so many

03:52:58.890 --> 03:53:01.443
very close relationship with their gods.

03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:09.096
I don't know what I'm supposed to do,

03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:17.593
but please,

03:53:24.240 --> 03:53:25.463
please walk with me.

03:53:29.877 --> 03:53:32.544
MATT: (low rumbling)

03:53:37.956 --> 03:53:39.756
ASHLEY: (sighs)

03:53:43.693 --> 03:53:44.793
Are you there?

03:53:50.270 --> 03:53:52.487
I take out my--

03:53:52.487 --> 03:53:56.500
not mine, but I take out the sword,

03:53:56.500 --> 03:53:59.453
the Holy Avenger, and I lay it all there.

03:54:02.744 --> 03:54:05.230
And I try to just let the rain fall on it.

03:54:09.100 --> 03:54:10.773
I don't know how to use this.

03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:18.355
I don't know if there's something that you can do.

03:54:18.355 --> 03:54:19.555
I-I--

03:54:22.685 --> 03:54:25.018
I don't know how to do this.

03:54:26.499 --> 03:54:27.590
(sighs)

03:54:34.456 --> 03:54:35.656
MATT: A flash.

03:54:38.151 --> 03:54:42.851
(thunder rumbling)

03:54:52.503 --> 03:54:54.545
The rain continues to fall.

03:54:56.430 --> 03:54:58.155
The blade looks damp and cold.

03:55:01.196 --> 03:55:04.036
ASHLEY: I actually feel like this is very bad for the blade.

03:55:05.710 --> 03:55:07.235
It's going to get rusted.

03:55:13.520 --> 03:55:15.220
I'm going to eat the whole flower.

03:55:16.810 --> 03:55:18.180
MATT: All right.

03:55:18.180 --> 03:55:21.340
ASHLEY: Because it's what Caduceus did and I'm trying

03:55:23.100 --> 03:55:24.950
to make some type of connection here.

03:55:29.013 --> 03:55:31.291
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw for me.

03:55:31.291 --> 03:55:32.124
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:55:39.636 --> 03:55:40.469
10.

03:55:41.440 --> 03:55:42.273
MATT: Okay.

03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:46.810
You sit there for a bit, just trying to focus,

03:55:46.810 --> 03:55:49.290
holding this petrified wood in your hand.

03:55:49.290 --> 03:55:50.937
This dark,

03:55:53.020 --> 03:55:54.700
this pale,

03:55:54.700 --> 03:55:57.170
cold piece of what was once wood.

03:56:01.746 --> 03:56:05.930
And you begin to think back to experiences,

03:56:05.930 --> 03:56:06.763
memories.

03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:11.073
Back to the Dolorav Tribe.

03:56:13.130 --> 03:56:14.110
Thinking back to

03:56:15.660 --> 03:56:19.630
finding the shattered statue of the Storm Lord

03:56:19.630 --> 03:56:22.483
in your fugue state wanderings.

03:56:23.921 --> 03:56:27.150
A similar sense of cold rain on your face then

03:56:27.150 --> 03:56:28.458
when <i>he</i> first found <i>you</i>.

03:56:31.523 --> 03:56:34.563
Remembering every storm that called you to the horizon.

03:56:39.630 --> 03:56:40.683
You're feeling weird.

03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:43.427
Your stomach's churning a little.

03:56:48.480 --> 03:56:50.813
(exhales)

03:56:51.678 --> 03:56:53.336
Close your eyes and breathe.

03:56:55.550 --> 03:56:56.383
You inhale

03:56:57.570 --> 03:56:58.653
and you exhale.

03:56:59.718 --> 03:57:00.634
You inhale

03:57:01.605 --> 03:57:02.855
and you exhale.

03:57:04.680 --> 03:57:05.633
You inhale,

03:57:06.650 --> 03:57:09.900
and as you exhale you feel this rumble in your chest.

03:57:09.900 --> 03:57:12.813
Like a purr. (low rumbling)

03:57:16.143 --> 03:57:17.060
You inhale.

03:57:20.399 --> 03:57:22.982
(exhaling, low rumbling)

03:57:24.999 --> 03:57:26.258
It's weird.

03:57:27.230 --> 03:57:29.430
You feel very strange and you open your eyes

03:57:32.120 --> 03:57:33.820
and you're no longer in the grove.

03:57:37.570 --> 03:57:39.490
You look around you and there is just

03:57:39.490 --> 03:57:41.160
broken,

03:57:41.160 --> 03:57:42.470
open

03:57:42.470 --> 03:57:44.210
badlands

03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:46.733
endlessly in every direction.

03:57:46.733 --> 03:57:48.863
Flat, shattered shale.

03:57:50.170 --> 03:57:52.600
Jagged rockscapes.

03:57:52.600 --> 03:57:54.438
Dust and bone.

03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:59.970
You can look around and see bits of stone

03:57:59.970 --> 03:58:02.783
forming up out of the ground and almost reaching.

03:58:05.212 --> 03:58:07.342
You glance and can see iron cages

03:58:08.740 --> 03:58:10.633
and broken chains scattered about.

03:58:12.700 --> 03:58:14.423
And above you, rain.

03:58:15.460 --> 03:58:16.293
Rain.

03:58:17.330 --> 03:58:19.883
Rain pouring down from the clouds above.

03:58:23.073 --> 03:58:24.960
(loud thunder crashing)

03:58:24.960 --> 03:58:26.597
Flashing white light

03:58:26.597 --> 03:58:28.570
and this boom of thunder to the right

03:58:28.570 --> 03:58:31.930
as dust seems to be spraying from the sky.

03:58:31.930 --> 03:58:33.590
You find yourself wincing

03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:35.640
as you feel the impact of the bolt of lightning

03:58:35.640 --> 03:58:37.830
that has not struck far from where you sit.

03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:39.683
You stand, instinctually,

03:58:41.090 --> 03:58:42.690
reaching for the blade that you set before you,

03:58:42.690 --> 03:58:43.640
but it's not there.

03:58:50.250 --> 03:58:52.743
ASHLEY: I frantically start looking around for it.

03:58:54.840 --> 03:58:55.760
Anywhere.

03:58:55.760 --> 03:58:57.060
MATT: Roll a perception check.

03:59:01.470 --> 03:59:02.303
ASHLEY: 21.

03:59:03.522 --> 03:59:04.480
MATT: You look about.

03:59:06.890 --> 03:59:08.190
You see a blade.

03:59:08.190 --> 03:59:09.540
You grab it and pick it up.

03:59:10.710 --> 03:59:11.610
It's broken,

03:59:11.610 --> 03:59:12.710
it's rusted,

03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:13.860
it's old.

03:59:13.860 --> 03:59:14.803
It's not yours.

03:59:16.220 --> 03:59:18.170
You look around, you see other weapons.

03:59:19.760 --> 03:59:21.060
Each in similar condition.

03:59:22.800 --> 03:59:25.610
You begin to see the broken bits of bone.

03:59:25.610 --> 03:59:26.443
The stone.

03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:30.440
You begin to sense a long history

03:59:30.440 --> 03:59:31.363
of battles fought,

03:59:32.580 --> 03:59:34.060
won,

03:59:34.060 --> 03:59:35.580
lost.

03:59:35.580 --> 03:59:37.250
Soldiers who've won.

03:59:37.250 --> 03:59:39.053
Soldiers that were lost.

03:59:41.700 --> 03:59:43.000
But your blade is nowhere.

03:59:44.850 --> 03:59:46.077
What do you do?

03:59:51.301 --> 03:59:53.407
ASHLEY: (sighs)

03:59:53.407 --> 03:59:56.023
MATT: You glance up and can see the darkened skies.

03:59:57.529 --> 03:59:59.020
(thunder crashing)

03:59:59.020 --> 04:00:00.370
Another flash of lightning.

04:00:01.880 --> 04:00:04.093
The storm is somewhat sparse where you are.

04:00:05.040 --> 04:00:07.190
But the clouds even grow darker still.

04:00:07.190 --> 04:00:09.283
A reddish haze on the horizon.

04:00:10.640 --> 04:00:12.300
Lightning you see flashing ahead,

04:00:12.300 --> 04:00:13.932
miles and miles ahead,

04:00:13.932 --> 04:00:17.596
rapidly arcing wild through the sky.

04:00:17.596 --> 04:00:20.880
(sparking)

04:00:20.880 --> 04:00:22.230
Occasionally touching down.

04:00:30.680 --> 04:00:31.513
ASHLEY: I will drop

04:00:32.590 --> 04:00:33.423
the dagger--

04:00:34.260 --> 04:00:35.853
the sword, the broken sword.

04:00:40.810 --> 04:00:42.400
And I'll start walking

04:00:44.980 --> 04:00:46.473
towards the horizon.

04:00:51.320 --> 04:00:52.763
I will continue to follow.

04:00:55.270 --> 04:00:57.437
MATT: One foot in front of the other.

04:00:57.437 --> 04:00:58.940
And another.

04:00:58.940 --> 04:01:00.090
And another.

04:01:00.090 --> 04:01:01.863
The mud slick beneath your boots.

04:01:03.290 --> 04:01:05.650
Continue to push, slide and catch yourself,

04:01:05.650 --> 04:01:07.170
and continue to go.

04:01:07.170 --> 04:01:09.503
And as you do, the thunder gets louder,

04:01:10.740 --> 04:01:12.020
louder,

04:01:12.020 --> 04:01:12.970
and more recurring.

04:01:14.151 --> 04:01:18.901
(thunder rumbling, lightning crackling)

04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:23.330
ASHLEY: I'll just start running towards it

04:01:23.330 --> 04:01:24.973
just as fast as I can go.

04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:29.440
MATT: Splash, splash, splash.

04:01:29.440 --> 04:01:31.720
You run and run.

04:01:31.720 --> 04:01:34.528
The thunder continues to roll. Almost constant now.

04:01:34.528 --> 04:01:37.278
(rumbling)

04:01:40.670 --> 04:01:42.248
"The dark sky

04:01:43.210 --> 04:01:46.012
"that claims the horizon."

04:01:46.012 --> 04:01:47.895
(rumbling)

04:01:48.790 --> 04:01:50.772
"The crackling light

04:01:52.407 --> 04:01:54.280
"that splits the tree

04:01:55.360 --> 04:01:56.193
"and flesh."

04:01:59.380 --> 04:02:01.110
"The flood

04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:03.670
"that carves stone

04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:04.733
"and earth."

04:02:09.200 --> 04:02:10.033
You look up

04:02:11.900 --> 04:02:13.173
and you can see,

04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:17.553
faintly in the clouds of the growing storm ahead of you,

04:02:19.420 --> 04:02:20.935
that familiar face.

04:02:24.725 --> 04:02:28.937
(thunder rumbling)

04:02:28.937 --> 04:02:30.150
"In our wake

04:02:32.340 --> 04:02:34.807
"the rains that nurture

04:02:35.752 --> 04:02:37.252
"and cleanse.

04:02:41.185 --> 04:02:42.018
"I

04:02:43.227 --> 04:02:44.894
"am the storm.

04:02:46.822 --> 04:02:49.405
"What are you?"

04:03:00.303 --> 04:03:01.686
ASHLEY: I am your champion.

04:03:07.090 --> 04:03:08.408
MATT: "Chain breaker.

04:03:10.740 --> 04:03:12.865
"Angel reborn.

04:03:14.920 --> 04:03:15.753
"Punisher

04:03:17.490 --> 04:03:18.798
"and redeemer.

04:03:24.040 --> 04:03:25.281
"Show me."

04:03:28.195 --> 04:03:29.749
And that's where we'll pick up next week.

04:03:29.749 --> 04:03:30.963
SAM: Oh! Oh!

04:03:32.005 --> 04:03:33.760
LAURA: Oh jeez louise!

04:03:33.760 --> 04:03:35.038
Just right there?
MATT: Yep.

04:03:35.038 --> 04:03:36.018
TALIESIN: Show me what you got.

04:03:36.018 --> 04:03:38.016
MARISHA: Show me what you got!

04:03:38.016 --> 04:03:39.203
ASHLEY: Ooh!

04:03:39.203 --> 04:03:40.828
LAURA: You got a week to think about

04:03:40.828 --> 04:03:42.069
what you're going to do.

04:03:44.094 --> 04:03:45.414
TALIESIN: This is what I wanted.

04:03:45.414 --> 04:03:46.455
This is what I want.

04:03:46.455 --> 04:03:47.470
SAM: So you don't have a sword?

04:03:47.470 --> 04:03:50.180
TALIESIN: I wanted everyone to get high and find their god.

04:03:50.180 --> 04:03:52.370
TRAVIS: You don't need a sword.

04:03:52.370 --> 04:03:53.430
SAM: Brass knuckles?

04:03:53.430 --> 04:03:54.797
LIAM: Your spine.

04:03:54.797 --> 04:03:57.130
TALIESIN: I said not to eat the plants, too.

04:03:57.130 --> 04:03:59.538
ASHLEY: Did you?!
TALIESIN: Just the ones I was eating.

04:03:59.538 --> 04:04:01.274
Some of them are really weird!

04:04:01.274 --> 04:04:02.540
ASHLEY: Well,

04:04:02.540 --> 04:04:05.030
you had said it and I feel like for Yasha,

04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:06.305
she'd be like--
TALIESIN: No, you did it right-

04:04:06.305 --> 04:04:08.060
ASHLEY: "Oh, that's how you connect to a god."

04:04:08.060 --> 04:04:09.798
TALIESIN: Oh no, this is the plot of Gremlins.

04:04:09.798 --> 04:04:12.418
(laughter)

04:04:12.418 --> 04:04:15.400
LIAM: Give it to Yasha, she'll eat anything!

04:04:16.390 --> 04:04:18.860
MATT: A bunch of smaller Yashas
start jumping out of her back.

04:04:18.860 --> 04:04:21.330
ASHLEY: I mean, she's tried everything at this point

04:04:21.330 --> 04:04:22.865
to try to make the connection.

04:04:22.865 --> 04:04:24.179
TRAVIS: Orphan Maker doesn't need a sword.

04:04:24.179 --> 04:04:26.966
ASHLEY: I'm going to be barfing all the next day.

04:04:26.966 --> 04:04:28.223
Just sick as a dog.
SAM: Worth it.

04:04:28.223 --> 04:04:29.426
MATT: It's probably going to be a rough morning.

04:04:29.426 --> 04:04:31.380
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's going to be a rough morning.

04:04:31.380 --> 04:04:33.702
MATT: Could be a rough evening, we just started.

04:04:33.702 --> 04:04:36.220
TALIESIN: Covered in your own sick.
TRAVIS: What is Kord the deity of?

04:04:36.220 --> 04:04:38.380
MATT: Of strength, of contest,

04:04:38.380 --> 04:04:41.110
of storms and

04:04:42.160 --> 04:04:44.400
all manner of things in that space.

04:04:44.400 --> 04:04:46.462
TALIESIN: Freedom.
MARISHA: Contest.

04:04:46.462 --> 04:04:47.295
LAURA: Yeah.

04:04:47.295 --> 04:04:48.728
LIAM: She's throwing up swords.

04:04:48.728 --> 04:04:49.916
Is that okay?

04:04:49.916 --> 04:04:52.499
(laughter)

04:04:53.820 --> 04:04:54.828
MATT: Some people eat 'em.

04:04:54.828 --> 04:04:55.936
Some people throw 'em.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

04:04:55.936 --> 04:04:59.920
MATT: Some people just find them everywhere.

04:04:59.920 --> 04:05:02.220
We'll pick up from there next week.

04:05:02.220 --> 04:05:03.850
SAM: Exciting.
MARISHA: Oh my gosh.

04:05:03.850 --> 04:05:05.330
MATT: It's going to fun.

04:05:05.330 --> 04:05:07.053
In the interim,

04:05:07.053 --> 04:05:08.390
we'll see you then.

04:05:08.390 --> 04:05:10.380
Thank you so much for following us

04:05:10.380 --> 04:05:12.020

04:05:12.020 --> 04:05:13.540
We love you very much.

04:05:13.540 --> 04:05:15.617

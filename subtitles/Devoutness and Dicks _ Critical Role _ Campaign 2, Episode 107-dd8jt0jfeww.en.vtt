00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.437
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:06.085
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:09.390
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.223
MATT: There you have it.

00:00:10.223 --> 00:00:11.392
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:12.880
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.700
beginning with the first of our two sponsors tonight. Sam?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.652
TALIESIN: Thank you, Matt.

00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:20.690
This episode is brought to you by Elderwood Academy,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.560
makers of quality gaming themed gear, including spell books,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.300
deck boxes, dice towers, rolling trays and a whole lot more.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.429
They specialize in--

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.840
SAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.903
What is going on?

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:35.520
Taliesin, Elderwood Academy wants me, Sam Riegel,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.863
to do the sponsorship tonight, a-heh, and not you, okay?

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:39.970
TALIESIN: What are you talking about?

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.000
I am Sam Riegel.
SAM: What?!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.840
TALIESIN: Can't you tell by my inane smile

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.388
and my spongy feeble hands?

00:00:46.388 --> 00:00:49.430
SAM: No, no, no, no, nice try, but come on,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.610
everybody here knows that I'm the real Sam Riegel,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.780
right, guys?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.580
I mean...
TRAVIS: Uh.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.670
I don't know.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.510
I'm actually having a hard time telling who is who.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.700
I mean, you both seem really bad at sports.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.040
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.420
Look, it's me.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.610
I mean, look, look at my cow-sized teeth.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.870
TALIESIN: No, no, I'm Sam.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.230
Look at my lack of human emotion and overwhelming hubris.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.500
LAURA: Yeah, this is tough.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.554
I mean, they're both really annoying.

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:16.387
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:17.220
LAURA: Oh, I know.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.540
Let's ask them questions to prove which one's the imposter.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.320
Okay. Candidate A, how much does a carton of milk cost?

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.420
TALIESIN: Well, not very much,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.461
somewhere between
$100 to $400, I presume.

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:32.120
LIAM: I mean, that sounds like Sam;

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.530
he's never done his own shopping.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.580
Candidate B, what is something you'd say to your pet dog?

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.190
SAM: Oh, well, that's a simple question.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.540
You run their hand across their, I want to say hair

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.780
and you call them an excellent canine

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.030
and then fetch your butler to go disinfect your hands

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.490
right afterwards.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.130
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, Sam is terrible with animals.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.840
So that actually does track.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.040
Candidate A, if you could have lunch with any celebrity,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.440
living or dead, who would it be?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.497
TALIESIN: Myself, of course. What
a stupid question, Marisha.

00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.550
ASHLEY: Aw, what an asshole!

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.690
That's our Sam!

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.090
I'm pretty sure it's Candidate A, but okay,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.930
just in case, both of you answer the following question.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.540
What is the URL of tonight's sponsor?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.220
TALIESIN: Hold on a second, I've got it right here.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.370
SAM: It's elderwoodacademy.com/criticalrole.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.023
MATT: Oh yeah, that's Sam, most definitely.

00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:31.530
TALIESIN: How did you know?

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.610
MATT: Sorry, Taliesin. Sam may have no social awareness,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.660
sincere feelings and you know,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.400
hell, he might not even actually be a really good person,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.520
but the one thing he is perfect at is corporate shilling.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.478
You can't fake that kind of insincerity.

00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:46.160
SAM: Aww, (sniffs).

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.060
Thank you, Matt, that's really nice.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.760
Anyway, Elderwood Academy makes high-end customized gear

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.640
for all players and characters.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.520
Everything's designed to be functional and immersive.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.750
Check out their amazing stuff

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.110

on elderwoodacademy.com/criticalrole.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.511
I love you guys. Back to you, Matt.

00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.880
TRAVIS: What a piece of shit.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.678
MATT: Thank you, Sam. You are a piece of shit.

00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:20.368
(laughter)

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:22.140
Our second sponsor tonight, our returning friends

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.430
since the beginning of this campaign,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.686
our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:27.620
ALL: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond ♪

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.240
MATT: They have their new Avrae Discord Bot available,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.370
which is designed to streamline playing D&amp;D games

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.640
on Discord, which is pretty awesome.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.530
You can link Avrae directly into your D&amp;D Beyond account

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.430
and it'll help you run your games online with your friends

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.591
through the Discord app, features advanced dice,

00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:47.604
SRD and character sheet integration, initiative tracking.

00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:52.288
You'll actually never need another D&amp;D bot again, for now.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.340
But yes, start playing D&amp;D through Discord today

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.340
at dndbeyonda.link/avrae, Avrae.

00:04:00.397 --> 00:04:02.520
Also, it is D&amp;D Beyond's third anniversary,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.353
which is amazing.

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:05.600
Congratulations to you guys, three years

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.250
of making awesome stuff easier for people.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.380
They're giving away a free dice of healing set

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.820
to anybody who's a subscriber this month

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.030
as part of this anniversary, so enjoy

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.320
and happy anniversary to you guys.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.153
TRAVIS: Amazing.

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:19.303
LAURA: I want it.

00:04:19.303 --> 00:04:20.494
MATT: Well, you should sign in and do it.

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:22.061
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Right now if you can.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.070
(laughter)

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.090
We have the technology! Literally, it's in front of you.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.930
All right, other announcements we got,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.970
in case you guys missed it, Vox Machina: Origins, Volume II

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.801
is available right now.

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:36.375
(cheering)

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:37.862
It's so pretty.

00:04:37.862 --> 00:04:39.430
LIAM: There's stuff printed on the pages even?

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.643
MATT: I know, it's crazy.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.080
This wonderful series is written by our good friend,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080
Jody Houser.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.600
She does an incredible job with this,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.270
original art by our amazing Olivia Samson,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.443
who started this series with us, color by MSASSYK.

00:04:52.443 --> 00:04:54.109
Did I say it right?
LIAM: I think.

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:56.030
MATT: I always get it wrong, I'm so sorry if I got it wrong.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.100
Lettering by Ariana Maher and designed by

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.910
Cindy Cacerez-Sprague, I believe, and sorry

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.230
if I messed it up, too.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.203
We have the trade paperback as you saw and

00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:07.450
with the wonderful cover art there from our good

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.560
critter friend, William Kirkby, which you probably have seen

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.203
his art through many of our galleries and stuff online,

00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:13.430
he's amazing.
LIAM: @chamonkee!

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.720
MATT: Indeed.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.300
Available at your local comic and bookstores, Amazon,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.380
Barnes &amp; Noble, and as well as digitally

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.410
through Dark Horse Digital and ComiXology.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.600
There is also the hardcover limited edition version

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.356
of Volume II, which sits alongside the Volume I.

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:29.026
LAURA: So beautiful.

00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:31.100
MATT: Which is so pretty.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.520
LIAM: Looks demonic, I love it.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.250
MATT: I know, it's pretty intense, works within the story

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.112
and themes of it.

00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:37.118
LAURA: No, I haven't seen that.

00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:39.368
MATT: It comes with the foul red cover,

00:05:39.368 --> 00:05:41.076
the foil stamped cover and slip case,

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:44.150
designed by the same Cindy who I mentioned earlier,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.360
and lithographic art

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.450
by Hunter Severn Bonyun and Stephan McGowan.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.700
Yeah, they gave me all the names tonight,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.950
so I'm ruining them all and I'm so sorry.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.580
The limited edition is available exclusively

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.796
through Critical Role,

00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:59.613
it's, like, our own program.
MARISHA: You even ruined our own name.

00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:01.770
MATT: I know, I know!

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.880
It's too many names; they're all just falling apart now.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.830
We're done, we're done, I'm out.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.850
TALIESIN: A recording session--
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah!

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.970
MATT: The limited edition is available exclusively through

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.700
our US, UK, and Australia online shops and once it's gone,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.910
it's gone, so get one if you can.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.830
There's that and a big quick shout out to the game

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.630
Popup Dungeon, which just came out recently.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.120
It's a tactical rogue-like RPG video game

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.980
that was inspired by tabletop games like the ones

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.520
that we play here.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.997
You face incredibly difficult campaigns as you play.

00:06:30.997 --> 00:06:33.170
You can also create your own abilities, items, heroes,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.060
villains and games to customize entirely.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.000
It's super adorable.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.390
You can check out Popup Dungeon on Twitter

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.952
for a special giveaway that we're running right now

00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:42.780
and see if you can hear some familiar voices

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.580
throughout the game, including myself.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.530
So they're awesome folk. They've been working hard

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.195
on this and it's actually pretty cool, so check them out.

00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:52.777
Last but not least, Laura, you had something to talk.

00:06:52.777 --> 00:06:54.140
LAURA: I did.
SAM: Oh yeah!

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.050
LIAM: What is it?!

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.525
LAURA: Well, it's just a little thing,

00:06:56.525 --> 00:06:58.733
but we were off last week,

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:01.020
but while we were off, this went on sale

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.276
and I had to show it off.

00:07:03.276 --> 00:07:04.612
TRAVIS: Is that a Frumpkin?

00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:08.014
LAURA: It is! It's a Frumpkin little hanging plushy.

00:07:08.014 --> 00:07:11.089
LIAM: (squealing)

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:12.710
MARISHA: He's so cute!

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.560
LIAM: (squealing)

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.670
LAURA: It's the cutest.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.400
So this is in the US, UK, and Australian shops

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.410
and it's designed by Jenny Park.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.490
It's available right now.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.700
Check your shops, see if it's in stock.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.150
It's so cute and it would make a great Christmas ornament,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.800
<i>I</i> think.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.073
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, it would.

00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:31.426
TRAVIS: Just don't drop it or it goes

00:07:31.426 --> 00:07:33.213
(poofing)
LIAM and LAURA: Yeah.

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:34.910
LIAM: Don't send him to go looking for anything

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.230
because he won't find it.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.538
MARISHA: Keep out the reach of guards.
LAURA: You want to see him, Liam?

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:39.196
LIAM: Yes!
LAURA: Then keep him on your desk.

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:40.054
LIAM: Yes, please.

00:07:40.054 --> 00:07:42.520
TALIESIN: Good throw.
LIAM: Ooh!

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.393
I'm a dog person now, but I still love him.

00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:45.226
ASHLEY: Look at him.

00:07:45.226 --> 00:07:46.810
(laughter)

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.610
LAURA: So yeah, there's that.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.086
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura.

00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:51.407
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:07:51.407 --> 00:07:54.340
MATT: All right, I believe with that,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.040
it is time for us to jump into tonight's episode of...

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.285
LAURA: Oh god.

00:07:58.285 --> 00:07:59.804
MATT: Critical Role.

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:41.630
(laughter)

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.114
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:09:43.114 --> 00:09:44.420
(firing, explosion)

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.637
(laughter)

00:09:46.637 --> 00:09:48.605
MARISHA: I had to finish it, it was hard to--

00:09:48.605 --> 00:09:50.753
TRAVIS: Somebody cover her up in dirt.

00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:54.680
MATT: We're already off the rails, and we haven't started.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.783
So last we left off:

00:09:57.783 --> 00:10:01.120
The Mighty Nein, after spending
some time on the island of Rumblecusp

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.860
in anticipation for the coming preparations of Traveler Con.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.050
You discovered a people that lived here who had lost

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.140
their memories over time and some seemingly ancient entity

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.790
known as Vokodo that had taken residence

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.640
beneath the mountain.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.160
Upon learning about the different mysteries

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.860
and dangers throughout, you discovered

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.030
a cavern full of abandoned ships.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.330
You fought dangerous creatures around

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.250
and eventually went beneath the mountain itself

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.640
to fight this Vokodo creature.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.350
You learned, as it was dying, of what it was it seemed

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.885
to be fleeing from within the Astral Sea.

00:10:33.885 --> 00:10:36.720
You escaped the boiling waters with the treasure

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.323
that you had accrued from its hoard,

00:10:39.323 --> 00:10:41.510
and, it seemed, freed the people of Vokodo

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.110
from this clouding fog that
removed their memories from them.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.840
As they returned, many of them realized who they once were

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.020
and decided to return to their old life.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.380
Some chose to stay with the new life they had made here,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.000
but nevertheless, a night of final celebration

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.380
for the villagers of Vokodo as the village that it once was,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.930
was brought forth around a large bonfire.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.950
You all helped them into this final night,

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.540
you saw some early arrivals to the Traveler Con event,

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.384
begin to try and find their place amongst the vicinity.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:20.795
After saying your bits before the next day,

00:11:20.795 --> 00:11:25.795
you went and crashed up in Vilya's room and went to bed.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.378
And that was where we left off. So!

00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:34.070
As the warm temperature of the temperate island morning

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.520
begins to creep into the chamber,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.308
the seaside moisture in the air itself

00:11:41.308 --> 00:11:45.580
sticking in a sweaty way to your skin, you begin to wake up

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.650
one by one within the comfortable interior of the tree

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.500
where Vilya had taken up residence as Viridian

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.633
for quite some time.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:58.048
So what would you like to do, Mighty Nein?

00:11:58.048 --> 00:12:00.048
LAURA: (sighs)

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.242
SAM: Did you have your morning constitutional?

00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:05.362
(laughter)

00:12:05.362 --> 00:12:06.500
Or is that just you waking up?

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.340
LAURA: This is me waking up.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.173
SAM: Okay, cool, cool.

00:12:08.173 --> 00:12:09.873
TRAVIS: Got to love being regular.

00:12:09.873 --> 00:12:12.206
(chuckling)

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.911
LAURA: What should we do?

00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:18.960
TALIESIN: I mean, I suppose we should start setting up.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.087
LAURA: Well, yeah, obviously.

00:12:21.087 --> 00:12:23.560
But the people, can we peek outside?

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.640
Are there still a bunch of people, like, running around

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.415
looking worried?
TRAVIS: Are there bodies on the ground?

00:12:27.415 --> 00:12:28.368
LAURA: I know, yeah.

00:12:28.368 --> 00:12:29.201
(laughter)

00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:31.120
MATT: It's just a massacre-- no.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.540
TRAVIS: Shit, we slept heavy.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.360
MATT: You glance out from the elevated portion of this tree

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.142
where you guys spent the evening.

00:12:38.142 --> 00:12:41.220
You into the main loose thoroughfare of this village

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.870
that surrounds the central space and you can see

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.876
there are people walking about, some folks

00:12:44.876 --> 00:12:47.110
that are going about their common day to day business

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.730
within the village of Vo, some people

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.290
that have gathered things and are currently packing.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.840
What looks to be a group of individuals that are

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.340
in the first batch of those leaving for the day.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.880
Vilya has already left, woke up before any of you did,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.050
and is not in the chamber.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.268
You could see now from above

00:13:01.268 --> 00:13:04.260
that she is currently gathering with those individuals,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.580
prepping them and making sure that everyone

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.430
who is leaving today has everything they need,

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.660
because it is a one way trip for them.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.291
TRAVIS: Right, and she's going to-- Wait.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:15.400
TALIESIN: Have we already set up the dispersal for--

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.270
we were going to give everyone a little money right before

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.103
they--
LAURA: Yeah, it was--

00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:20.110
SAM: We're going to give them a to-go bag or something.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.143
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:21.143 --> 00:13:23.109
We were going to give them each 50 gold,

00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:25.287
everybody that was leaving.

00:13:25.287 --> 00:13:29.260
So if-- you remember what I gave you guys, right?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.300
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Yeah, of course.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.133
LAURA: Okay.

00:13:31.133 --> 00:13:35.818
So if everybody gives me back 112 gold

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.610
and I don't give Vilya any gold

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.550
but Vilya you'll still get a bunch of platinum,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.210
is that okay with you?

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.530
MATT: She can't hear you from the side,

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.700
she's currently conversing.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.420
It's not imminent, the people aren't, like, getting ready

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.990
to leave now, but you gather probably in the next

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.260
couple of hours or so, they'll probably be shoving off.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
LAURA: Okay, if we don't give any gold to Vilya,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.880
but we still give her a bunch of platinum and silver

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.280
and copper, then everybody will get 50 gold that's leaving.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.420
That's 60 people roughly leaving that will get 50 gold each.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.948
TALIESIN: Already threw you 112.

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.406
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Same.

00:14:09.406 --> 00:14:10.833
LAURA: We'll put it all in little bags.

00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:12.108
What?
ASHLEY: 112?

00:14:12.108 --> 00:14:13.332
LAURA: 112 each.

00:14:13.332 --> 00:14:17.530
SAM: I'll also give an extra 50 for Vilya because...

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.319
LAURA: So she can get 50 gold, yeah, that's great, Nott.

00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:20.590
SAM: Well yeah, I mean she's got a family

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.790
that she's got to get back to.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.600
LAURA: I'll also give 50 gold to Vilya.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.960
SAM: She needs it, yeah.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.020
TALIESIN: I'll throw in a 50, too.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.100
LAURA: Oh, that's great.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.773
LAURA: So she gets 150 gold, that's wonderful.

00:14:31.773 --> 00:14:33.200
ASHLEY: Why don't we make it an even 200?

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.383
SAM: Ooh, boy.
LAURA: Okay.

00:14:35.866 --> 00:14:37.760
ASHLEY: Might as well, I don't know what I'm going to do

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.593
with this money.

00:14:38.593 --> 00:14:39.518
TALIESIN: No judgment.

00:14:39.518 --> 00:14:41.513
TRAVIS: Don't you fucking, don't.

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.390
(laughter)

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.930
SAM: We're all throwing in, but

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.497
if you guys don't <i>want to</i>, that's fine.

00:14:48.497 --> 00:14:49.900
TRAVIS: I saw that look.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.790
TALIESIN: If you've got needs, I understand.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.840
I live very frugally.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.980
SAM: It is an optional donation.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.931
TRAVIS: Eyes just above the tea cup, I saw it.

00:15:00.931 --> 00:15:03.264
(laughter)

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.030
MARISHA: Stop looking at me, Veth.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.613
SAM: I just think you're great.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.870
MARISHA: All right, fine.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.770
LIAM: It's one of those situations
where the gratuity is already

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.002
on the receipt and that's already been taken care of.

00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:20.890
LAURA: 250 gold for Vilya, cool cool cool.
SAM: But you get excellent service.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.020
ASHLEY: Who knows, you know, if she has to go home

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.560
to her family, if she has to take care of her family.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.177
LAURA: Or an entire village of people, you know.
SAM: She definitely does, yes.

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:31.530
TRAVIS: She grew a leg out of plants, I think she's fine.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.365
LAURA: Fjord, did you want to give 50 gold to Vilya?

00:15:35.365 --> 00:15:36.198
TRAVIS: Who?

00:15:36.198 --> 00:15:38.710
(laughter)

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.593
LAURA: Did you want to?

00:15:39.593 --> 00:15:41.770
SAM: Marisha, you need that flashlight on right now?

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.470
Is that something you need?

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.303
MARISHA: No, I needed--

00:15:44.303 --> 00:15:45.764
TRAVIS: How much is she getting right now?

00:15:45.764 --> 00:15:46.597
MARISHA: Oh!

00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:49.350
(laughter)

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.110
TALIESIN: I was wondering what that was.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.379
TRAVIS: Beau, turn your stupid gloves off.

00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:56.011
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I can't read the menu.

00:15:56.011 --> 00:15:57.285
It's so dark in here.

00:15:57.285 --> 00:15:59.680
LIAM: Give me back my driftglobe. What are you doing?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.478
LAURA: Okay, so 250 gold for Vilya.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.630
TRAVIS: Yes, (mumbling).

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.150
LAURA: 300 gold for Vilya.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.331
Good job, Fjord.

00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:11.123
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:16:11.123 --> 00:16:13.273
TALIESIN: She's somebody's mother, I'm just saying.

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:14.730
SAM: Somebody.
TALIESIN: Somebody's mother.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:15.563
ASHLEY: Somebody.

00:16:15.563 --> 00:16:17.380
MARISHA: I mean, she's been here for so long

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.040
that her kids are grown up by now.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.917
TRAVIS: Yeah, she could be lying through her teeth.

00:16:21.917 --> 00:16:23.247
"I have a family."

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.963
We need to do an insight check.

00:16:27.963 --> 00:16:29.570
LIAM: Sounds like a good cover story.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.890
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.520
TALIESIN: Just what she wants you to think.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.062
MARISHA: I gave 50 gold.

00:16:34.062 --> 00:16:35.462
LAURA: Yeah.

00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:36.810
SAM: That's nice.
MARISHA: Fine.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.428
LAURA: One, two, three, four, five, six--

00:16:39.428 --> 00:16:41.508
LIAM: Hold on. One.

00:16:41.508 --> 00:16:43.326
SAM: Oh boy.

00:16:43.326 --> 00:16:45.930
LIAM: Two.
TRAVIS: Oh boy. Oh no.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.860
LIAM: Three.
TALIESIN: Riveting.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.548
LIAM: Four, five, six.

00:16:49.548 --> 00:16:54.537
LAURA: Okay, so 350 gold for Vilya.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.600
That's wonderful.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.293
SAM: So while Vilya is organizing the exodus,

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.730
I mean, should we ask her if she needs any help or anything

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.210
or do we just turn our attention to--?

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.230
LAURA: I mean, we've got to get started setting up

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.900
for Traveler Con, you guys.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.140
We only have, like, six more days.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.145
TALIESIN: Maybe--
MARISHA: What do you need?

00:17:16.145 --> 00:17:17.010
Go ahead.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:17.843
TALIESIN: Oh no, I was--

00:17:17.843 --> 00:17:19.063
MARISHA: I have no plans.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.710
TALIESIN: Harder for you to give
money, so I figured you can talk.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.960
You go first, I was very impressed.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.629
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:17:28.629 --> 00:17:29.793
MARISHA: What do you need from us?

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.893
LAURA: Well...

00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:37.550
I mean, I think we probably need to build

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.740
a stage, right?

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.755
We need to have some sort of area

00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:45.410
where everyone can congregate, right?

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.400
MARISHA: Sure.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.563
LAURA: So you can work on that.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.710
Something, you know, that people can do for fun, you know,

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.743
so they're not bored, like, standing around.

00:17:54.743 --> 00:17:56.450
We don't want people getting in fights;

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.090
they need to be distracted.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.820
MARISHA: Fights are a lot of fun.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.780
LAURA: Yeah, but--

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.068
MARISHA: We should make a fighting ring!

00:18:03.068 --> 00:18:04.800
LAURA: We can make a fighting ring!
MARISHA: Or a pit.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.408
LAURA: Yeah, and we can make it

00:18:06.408 --> 00:18:08.210
in the shape of, like, a circle

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.108
and we can throw some little balls in there and stuff.

00:18:10.108 --> 00:18:11.410
MARISHA: Like a pool, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:15.003
SAM: Does that thematically connect with--

00:18:15.003 --> 00:18:17.960
I mean this is a religious pilgrimage, correct?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.480
I mean, does that--

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.600
ASHLEY: I feel like chaos and mayhem--

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.550
LAURA: Yeah, like, you know.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.383
SAM: Okay.

00:18:23.383 --> 00:18:25.230
TALIESIN: Maybe, like, food fighting
or something, I don't know.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.760
LAURA: Ooh, that's good, that's good.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.170
TALIESIN: Like something you could throw at people,

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.345
but it doesn't hurt too much.

00:18:29.345 --> 00:18:30.850
TRAVIS: It's like a little cafe, but you have to

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.800
fight for your food while you're in there.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.820
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.380
LAURA: But like, not aggressively, just like pie fighting.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.132
TALIESIN: Oh, maybe a big wall where people can draw stuff.

00:18:41.132 --> 00:18:42.907
TRAVIS: (zooming) Pie fighting.

00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:44.720
(laughter)

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.800
LIAM: Where are we right now? Are we still in our digs?

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.570
MATT: You're still in Vilya's chambers right now, yeah.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.720
MARISHA: I guess, Jes, what's the overall goal?

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.020
What is the culminating climactic event of Traveler Con?

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.853
What are we aiming at?

00:18:58.853 --> 00:19:02.630
LAURA: Ultimately, the goal-- and I need to talk

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.143
to the Traveler about this because, you know,

00:19:07.008 --> 00:19:08.200
I'm having some thoughts.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.783
But--

00:19:12.433 --> 00:19:14.516
Feel like Caduceus.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.940
MARISHA: You are sweating so much right now.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.520
LAURA: No. Well, it's warm in here.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.985
MARISHA: Yeah, but--

00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.993
LIAM: Apple does not fall far from the branch.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:27.620
LAURA: The ultimate, what we're
trying to make people believe

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.250
is that this Traveler has ascended,

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.330
like he's beyond the gates

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.240
and he's a god-y god-god now, and he's no longer

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.075
going to be able to, like, be right next to everybody.

00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:42.442
He's as powerful as the Wild Mother

00:19:42.442 --> 00:19:46.760
or as the lightning guy or as, you know, this dragon

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.180
or whatever the other gods are, I don't know.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:54.180
So he's got to be seen that way.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.765
SAM: So the ascension rite is the main event?

00:20:00.765 --> 00:20:02.950
LAURA: Yeah, that's the culmination of everything.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.240
SAM: Okay, do you know where you'd like that to happen?

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.343
LAURA: Well, here's what I'm thinking we could maybe do.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.216
So we can't actually rite-- he can't actually ascend

00:20:14.216 --> 00:20:15.677
because he's not a god.

00:20:15.677 --> 00:20:17.830
SAM: Yeah, but he can shoot up into the sky or something.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.860
LAURA: He could shoot up into the sky.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.610
I don't know how grand it would be.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.520
You know, he can make himself look really really big,

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.193
there's also that.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.073
I was thinking,

00:20:32.073 --> 00:20:36.140
what if we made people think

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.013
that they saw the ascension, but they didn't actually.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:46.100
Like, what if I asked people, like,

00:20:47.067 --> 00:20:50.980
"Hey guys, we need a few human sacrifices."

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.370
you know?

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:57.240
What if, like, a few people volunteered for that?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.485
Maybe one of you guys would be one of the volunteers.

00:20:59.485 --> 00:21:00.703
SAM: You're going to kill one of us?

00:21:00.703 --> 00:21:01.869
LAURA: Listen.
SAM: Okay.

00:21:01.869 --> 00:21:03.280
LAURA: Veth.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.385
MATT: "This just got extremely interesting."

00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:08.598
(exclaiming)

00:21:08.598 --> 00:21:10.160
MATT: As you both shift and you go to the source

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.110
of the voices, in one of the darker corners

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.708
of the chamber, where the heavy interior woodwork

00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:18.750
of the tree that has been kind of carved away,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.120
the shadow folds in there.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.780
The cloaked figure steps out, the hood back with the long,

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.120
heavy curling batch of lion mane-like reddish-orange hair

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.337
as the Traveler, Artagan, steps forward.

00:21:31.337 --> 00:21:33.500
"Terribly sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt."
LAURA: (squeaks)

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.150
MATT: "I had a moment thought I'd come in

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.420
"and see how things are going on."

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.120
LAURA: I run over and I give him a hug.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.810
MATT: "Jester!

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:43.643
"Are you excited?

00:21:43.643 --> 00:21:44.476
"I'm excited."

00:21:44.476 --> 00:21:46.660
LAURA: Yes, yes.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.250
So did you hear what I was saying about human sacrifice?

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.600
MATT: "That's about as much as I got and I'm very interested

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.433
"to hear how this has going to work."

00:21:52.433 --> 00:21:55.080
LAURA: So we ask people to be a human sacrifice, right?
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.471
LAURA: We take the volunteers,

00:21:57.471 --> 00:22:00.662
we drag them off to, like, the volcano or something--

00:22:00.662 --> 00:22:01.495
MATT: "Ooh."

00:22:01.495 --> 00:22:04.540
LAURA: -- and then we tell them they have to be separated

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.120
so we can cleanse them or some shit like that, I don't know.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.960
However you prepare people for sacrifice.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.300
MATT: "I like it."

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.930
LAURA: And then we alter their memories.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.100
SAM: Who can do that?

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.970
LAURA: Me!

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.920
TRAVIS: Oh, like the witch.
SAM: Have you done that before?

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.860
Oh, yes.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.627
LAURA: We change their memories and I bet you can do it too.

00:22:23.627 --> 00:22:25.433
MATT: "I've altered a few memories in my time."

00:22:25.433 --> 00:22:27.604
LAURA: You're the one who taught me how to do it.

00:22:27.604 --> 00:22:32.537
So we alter their memories and make them think

00:22:32.537 --> 00:22:36.211
that they were sacrificed

00:22:36.211 --> 00:22:37.500
and that they saw--

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.460
they were brought back to life, watching you ascend

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.693
into the heavens.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.402
SAM: So not just the sacrifice,

00:22:46.402 --> 00:22:49.987
but this act brought them

00:22:49.987 --> 00:22:50.950
back to life.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.900
LAURA: Yeah. So we can do it two ways.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.210
Like what if, one, we don't actually make them think

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.810
that they were sacrificed. We could make it be like,

00:23:01.767 --> 00:23:03.817
"Just kidding, we just want to see

00:23:03.817 --> 00:23:07.287
"who really loved the Traveler, as a present

00:23:07.287 --> 00:23:09.940
"for really loving him, you get to see the Ascension."

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.553
There's that one, or we can make them think

00:23:11.553 --> 00:23:13.600
that they really died.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.700
TRAVIS: Really died and then because of the Ascension

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.950
they were brought back to life?

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.720
LAURA: Yeah, because he's so powerful.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.130
And then they go back and they're, like, really believing it

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.643
so then they tell everybody that they watched him ascend.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.330
SAM: I love it, that's great stagecraft

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.490
and it's really excellent production value.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.323
TALIESIN: I will say,

00:23:34.323 --> 00:23:38.823
as someone who has dabbled religiously,

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:45.256
the human sacrifice angle sets a dangerous precedent?

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.690
I mean, is this just going to become a thing

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.663
that other people do?

00:23:50.663 --> 00:23:52.409
LAURA: Well I thought that-- you know, I just figured

00:23:52.409 --> 00:23:55.110
that might be something that was needed for ascending.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.040
MATT: "This is an interesting point, though, actually.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.810
"We are dealing with individuals and faith

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.090
"and we have a very different connection

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.760
"than most divinity does.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.510
"While I don't particularly ascribe to all

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.110
"the ideals of your mistress--"
TALIESIN: That's fair.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.960
MATT: "You do have quite a bit of

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.752
"experience with the fanaticals

00:24:15.752 --> 00:24:18.040
"so maybe you'd be the right partner

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.580
"for this planning endeavor. Would you be interested?"

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.550
TALIESIN: I mean, while I'm obviously not a believer,

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.980
I am here to help. There's room for a lot at the table.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.550
MATT: "Wonderful, you two work together then."

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.333
TALIESIN: Oh boy.
LAURA: Okay.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.601
SAM: If I may, just a few things.

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:42.040
The people who we get to sacrifice themselves, or--

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.520
LAURA: However we do it, if human sacrifice is not the way

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.840
we can figure something out.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.006
SAM: I love the idea, just a heads up,

00:24:48.006 --> 00:24:51.373
they may be considered prophets or something afterwards,

00:24:51.373 --> 00:24:53.360
and they may be praised themselves.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.490
Is that okay with both you?

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.875
MARISHA: Have you ever met anyone who thinks

00:24:57.875 --> 00:24:59.320
that they came back from the dead?

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.153
Remember Molly?

00:25:00.153 --> 00:25:02.658
He was insufferable. God, the ego.

00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:04.378
SAM: (laughs)

00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:05.843
MARISHA: I'm just saying, we could be creating egomaniacs.

00:25:05.843 --> 00:25:08.995
TRAVIS: Did you just say, "Do you remember Molly?"

00:25:08.995 --> 00:25:12.572
MARISHA: Yeah, not like, "Do you remember Molly?" but like,

00:25:12.572 --> 00:25:16.061
do you remember his shitty disposition?
SAM: Yeah, it was, like, three months ago.

00:25:16.061 --> 00:25:18.160
(laughter)

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.720
MARISHA: Was it? How long ago was it?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.553
TRAVIS: Ish?

00:25:21.553 --> 00:25:25.178
MATT: It's been almost half a year.

00:25:25.178 --> 00:25:26.153
LAURA: Oh wow.
MARISHA: Six months.

00:25:26.153 --> 00:25:27.490
SAM: You're right, you're right.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.437
TRAVIS: We do remember Molly!
TALIESIN: It's been a long time.

00:25:29.437 --> 00:25:32.970
MATT: A number of months, at least,
a number of months, at least.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.450
LAURA: So maybe it's just like, you know,

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.740
they don't actually think that they died, maybe it's,

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.420
you know, they got the blessing because

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.380
they were so devoted.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.360
SAM: No, I think it's great though, but you know

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.270
what I really like about that plan, if I may?

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.730
The only reason I'm speaking

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.270
with any authority at all is, once in Felderwin

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.686
I went to see a play

00:25:56.028 --> 00:25:58.094
and it was called...

00:25:58.961 --> 00:26:02.142
Peter Fawn, and it was--

00:26:02.142 --> 00:26:04.970
there was lots of stagecraft and stuff,

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.470
but towards the end of the play,

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.110
they did this thing where there was a fey creature,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.637
a little fey pixie creature that died and they were like,

00:26:13.637 --> 00:26:15.819
"Everyone in the audience needs to clap

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:19.586
"to bring the faith creature back to life again."

00:26:19.586 --> 00:26:22.680
So the audience participating in the event,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.850
made you really feel for that character so much

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.070
so what I'm saying is--

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.240
MATT: "Strangely, that is an actual ritual that works."

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.556
SAM: Oh wow, it's based in fact?

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.215
MATT: "Believe it or not."
SAM: That was a documentary.

00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:35.060
MATT: "Not that I've seen it. I hate the theater. Go on."

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.162
SAM: You hate the theater?

00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:38.136
MATT: "Shh. Continue."
SAM: Asshole.

00:26:38.136 --> 00:26:41.850
Anyway, I was just going to say,

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.970
the audience doing something to make this Ascension happen

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.174
would get them even more

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:49.998
emotionally invested in it.

00:26:49.998 --> 00:26:52.270
So if they--

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.800
LAURA: They all had to bang on drums!

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.630
SAM: That's amazing. Maybe during the week

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:56.487
you said something like,

00:26:56.487 --> 00:26:58.070
"We should all give them a fun activity."

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.947
Maybe it's making their drum stick or something.

00:27:00.947 --> 00:27:02.510
LAURA: And they all look like dicks!

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.390
SAM: Yes! And then at the end of the week

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.970
they all beat their dicks as hard as they can.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.070
ASHLEY: Wait, didn't you carve some?

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.097
SAM: Just beat that dick as hard as you can.
LAURA: Yeah, but they're all little.

00:27:11.097 --> 00:27:13.271
They'd make a little tiny drum roll.

00:27:13.271 --> 00:27:15.753
SAM: Then they'll make the Traveler just shoot up.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.882
MATT: "Interesting idea, you're not wrong on that.

00:27:20.882 --> 00:27:25.740
"What if, what if they pray--

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.832
"beat, whatever-- too hard

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.486
"and it destroys me?"

00:27:31.486 --> 00:27:33.050
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA: (gasps)

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.920
MATT: "Then it's not my fault. It's on them.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.530
"They're left with the guilt and I'm home free."

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.679
LAURA: Ooh, I like it.

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:42.348
MARISHA: Wait, what?
SAM: Can you beat it so hard that it can kill someone?

00:27:42.348 --> 00:27:43.223
TRAVIS: Yeah, make you go blind.

00:27:43.223 --> 00:27:44.450
LAURA: I've heard of dicks falling off.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.382
SAM: Wow.

00:27:45.382 --> 00:27:49.370
LAURA: They had to be really infected, almost like--

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.690
But they've fallen off.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.380
MARISHA: Hang on, though, why that choice?

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:59.171
Why leave them with, you know,

00:27:59.171 --> 00:28:01.337
prolonged and insufferable guilt for something

00:28:01.337 --> 00:28:03.702
that they didn't actually do when it could be

00:28:03.702 --> 00:28:05.927
spun a little bit more positively?

00:28:05.927 --> 00:28:09.277
LIAM: Perhaps we give them a big party

00:28:09.277 --> 00:28:12.760
and if it does not reach the climax

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.460
that they were hoping for, then they have

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.890
to redouble their efforts and continue their faith

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.723
and try harder,

00:28:19.723 --> 00:28:21.520
into the future.
LAURA: No, no, no.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.570
I like it better if the Traveler dies, no offense.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.470
MATT: "I'm not actually going to die."
LAURA: Yeah, I know,

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.411
I like it better that way,

00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:31.423
because then they can move on to another god

00:28:31.423 --> 00:28:34.430
and they're not trapped forever believing in something

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.430
that's not going to help them.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.696
MARISHA: Okay, I can get behind that,

00:28:38.696 --> 00:28:40.670
but maybe we sidestep the

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.520
"it's their fault" thing.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.353
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:28:43.353 --> 00:28:45.970
MATT: "I suppose so, yes."
LAURA: Oh well, yeah, sure.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.459
SAM: If it was something like it's an ecstatic death,

00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:55.330
like he is obliterated so that he can go forth

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.717
into the heavens never to be seen again

00:28:56.717 --> 00:28:58.242
and that's something that he wanted?

00:28:58.242 --> 00:29:00.850
MATT: "You did say worship something else.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.550
"Is there a way to, like, pass the divine buck, even?"

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.927
LAURA: Sure, I mean, what if we said like,

00:29:04.927 --> 00:29:06.367
"Oh my gosh, you know what?

00:29:06.367 --> 00:29:10.457
"The Traveler has been super buddy-buddy with,

00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:12.931
"I don't know, the Wild Mother or something."
TALIESIN: Moon Weaver.

00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:16.550
LAURA: "The Moon Weaver or something, and the Traveler

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.567
"is now telling you like,

00:29:18.567 --> 00:29:21.840
"'Oh, you should worship this other person,'

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.558
"because they're, like, best friends or something."

00:29:25.558 --> 00:29:26.391
MATT: "Interesting."

00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:29.120
LAURA: Like you endorse another god.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.500
MARISHA: Yeah, an endorsement.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.250
LIAM: Just to be clear, though, and it seems like

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.860
this ship has sailed, but there isn't any chance

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.130
you would want to actually try to be the thing

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.060
that these people think that you are?

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.203
MATT: "God no, there's way too much responsibility."

00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:45.940
TALIESIN: Just surprised that there's so much responsibility

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.056
for what is essentially a chaos religion.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.866
MATT: "Trust me, at a certain point

00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:53.720
"it just becomes untenable.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.110
"I want to do my things, not their things."

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.943
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:56.943 --> 00:29:59.135
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, what are your things?

00:29:59.135 --> 00:30:00.899
It'll just help, creatively.

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:04.574
(laughter)

00:30:04.574 --> 00:30:05.930
SAM: This is the pre-interview?

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.020
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.110
MATT: "I don't take you to be a creature of the whim."

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.000
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.060
MATT: "That's in all that I am, nothing but whim.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.270
"Whimsy, if you will."

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.270
TALIESIN: Whimsy, I like whimsy.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.000
MATT: "But in the sense that it's whatever I want to do,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.533
"whenever and I do not want anybody else

00:30:18.533 --> 00:30:20.630
"to tell me not to do it."

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.240
TALIESIN: Is there anything you just don't like to do

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.271
or-- other than the theater?

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.370
MATT: "There needs to be a fun element of it,

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.740
"which means a bit of misery to those

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.510
"that probably deserve it and a bit of laughter

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.518
"for those that don't."

00:30:37.518 --> 00:30:39.026
TALIESIN: Moon Weaver.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.818
LAURA: The Moon Weaver.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.070
LIAM: So you like to get your hands on life

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.810
and just squeeze it for all it's worth?

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.670
MATT: "Oh, continuously.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.150
"In fact, there was this-- no.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.220
"Another time."

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.480
TRAVIS: If I may, have you made yourself as available

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.160
to these people that are arriving

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.850
as you have to Jester over time?

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.300
MATT: "Oh, dear me, no.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.410
"I think, and it is not your fault at all, my dear,

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.450
"but you've spoiled me.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:07.280
"I assumed it would be the same experience elsewhere,

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.070
"but you're one of a kind. Most everyone else in this world

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:15.810
"is-- well, dreary, boring, aggressively selfish.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.160
LAURA: There's a bitch out there.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.505
MATT: "Which one?"
SAM: What?

00:31:19.505 --> 00:31:21.073
LAURA: Like, what was her name?

00:31:22.156 --> 00:31:23.412
Celia?

00:31:23.412 --> 00:31:25.211
MATT: "Celia, yes. (laughs)

00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:28.040
"She found one of your pamphlets actually."

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.873
LAURA: She did?!

00:31:28.873 --> 00:31:30.067
MATT: "Yes, passing through."

00:31:30.067 --> 00:31:30.920
TALIESIN: Oh, they work.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.140
LAURA: Oh, well, sorry about that, but oof.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:33.973
MATT: "It's all right.

00:31:33.973 --> 00:31:35.908
"Look, she's a bit of a bitch,

00:31:35.908 --> 00:31:40.440
"but that cruelty makes for some fun pranks on occasion."

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.950
LAURA: Oh, I bet she does some really mean ones, huh?

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.070
MATT: "Yes, maybe not always at the right targets,

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.210
"but she's learning.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.690
"She's one of the ones I'd like to possibly--"

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:54.100
TALIESIN: Well then, maybe that's the goal, is to remove you

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.733
from the equation, but see if we can

00:31:56.733 --> 00:31:59.649
keep everyone practicing what seems to be giving them

00:31:59.649 --> 00:32:01.840
a sense of joy and completion.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.680
It certainly gives you a sense of joy and completion

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.371
to be going around and spreading a little dissidence and--

00:32:07.371 --> 00:32:10.471
to be going around and spreading a little dissidence and--

00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:11.867
LAURA: (whispers) Chaos.
TALIESIN: -- chaos and...

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:13.950
MATT: "Chaos works well."

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.090
TALIESIN: And frivolity, I guess, I don't know.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.950
MATT: "The best way I can describe it is I've grown bored

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:25.950
"with having a religion, or a cult as some have said,

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.943
"I'm more interested in, like, an exclusive club.

00:32:30.279 --> 00:32:32.104
"A handful of chosen individuals.

00:32:32.104 --> 00:32:32.962
"They get cards and everything.

00:32:32.962 --> 00:32:34.462
"It's wonderful."
LAURA: Ooh!

00:32:34.462 --> 00:32:37.110
TALIESIN: Sure, but just to set them
free to do their own thing

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.380
and especially if their own thing is kind of what

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.910
they were doing already.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.370
MATT: "Yeah, and if what they're doing is fun

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:45.070
"and they want me to come help,
maybe I'll stay for some fun."

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.190
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can keep you out of it, if you like.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.880
TRAVIS: Caduceus, what does the
Moon Weaver look like generally?

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.081
MATT: "Yeah, please do tell me.
You keep talking about this Moon Weaver.

00:32:53.081 --> 00:32:54.297
"I'm not very up to speed

00:32:54.297 --> 00:32:56.396
"on some of your 'gods.'"
TALIESIN: Mostly what I

00:32:56.396 --> 00:32:57.737
know about the Moon Weaver is

00:32:57.737 --> 00:33:02.737
because we have a few followers
of the Moon Weaver back home.

00:33:03.645 --> 00:33:05.885
In the ground, obviously.

00:33:05.885 --> 00:33:09.290
From what I remember from the
few times that we've had to run it,

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.865
it's not chaos necessarily,

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:15.440
but some trickstery-ish stuff,

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.103
a little bit of a lighthearted disguise and silliness,

00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:25.270
a little bit of-- oh man, this has been a while.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.540
MATT: "I'm familiar with the Moon Weaver,

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.844
"I'm just seeing what your information is."

00:33:27.844 --> 00:33:31.343
LAURA: Oh, you-- what is the Moon Weaver like?

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:32.540
MATT: "Eh.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.100
"Some similar ideas of trickery, though they're--"

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.600
TALIESIN: A little more low key?

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.390
MATT: "They're a little more, I don't know,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:44.390
"esoteric and mysterious. I like
to be a little more present."

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.095
TALIESIN: You could make a bit of a

00:33:48.095 --> 00:33:50.070
heavier subset of that,

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.689
if you know what I mean, kind of a...

00:33:52.689 --> 00:33:55.080
MATT: "Yes, I suppose."
TALIESIN: A little bit of

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.600
more chaos, less illusion.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.670
MATT: "I'm surprised you're interested

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.410
"in passing followers off to someone
who isn't your purview."

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.700
TALIESIN: I mean, there's room for a lot in this world

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.990
and if you have a whole planet of carpenters,

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:13.090
then nothing ever gets done. You need a bit of everything

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.750
and we're fine.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.020
MATT: "That's a rare mindset in religion these days.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.130
"I respect that."

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.350
TALIESIN: Thank you, pleasure.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.910
TRAVIS: I was only wondering, if we are doing this hand off

00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:27.320
to the Moon Weaver, it might help, only because

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.300
our means are limited,

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.890
if you had the ability to, I don't know,

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:36.000
create some sort of grand show as the Moon Weaver

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.320
and officially usher them over, maybe not appearing

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.880
as yourself, but as this deity,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.605
then it might help move things along.

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:46.290
TALIESIN: Or a face of the Moon Weaver.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.915
MATT: "You see, deities are very--

00:34:49.915 --> 00:34:52.965
"well, sometimes vain creatures

00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:57.880
"that don't enjoy being made fun of in grandiose falsehoods

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.450
"and displays of ridiculousness.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.340
"In fact, it quite makes them frustrated,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.917
"so I love this idea."

00:35:04.917 --> 00:35:07.767
(chuckling)

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.801
MATT: "What are they going to do?

00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:11.609
"Be frustrated that we shunt some

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:14.550
"more followers their way? They'll be fine."
LAURA: I know! We are giving her people

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.029
to worship her, like she can be that pissed, right?

00:35:18.029 --> 00:35:19.580
I like it.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.170
That's way better than my human sacrifice.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:24.700
LIAM: And we're planning to frame this.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.873
MATT: "Oh, wait, we're losing the sacrifice element?"

00:35:27.873 --> 00:35:30.140
LAURA: I mean, I guess we don't have to.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.500
TALIESIN: I think it's probably for
the best. That just leads to--

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.647
LAURA: What if we just said, like,

00:35:33.647 --> 00:35:36.820
"Oh, I need sacrifices to be skinned,

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.420
"but you stay alive or something."

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.288
TALIESIN: People are going to--

00:35:39.288 --> 00:35:42.595
MARISHA: Whoa, holy shit, Jester.
TRAVIS: To be skinned?

00:35:42.595 --> 00:35:44.281
ASHLEY: That feels darker than actually dying.

00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:46.597
LAURA: Is it? I don't know.
MATT: "But

00:35:46.597 --> 00:35:47.905
"we can explore the idea.

00:35:47.905 --> 00:35:50.040
"Don't throw any ideas off the table yet

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.950
"until we've had a full discussion."

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:56.950
SAM: What if you just needed one
human sacrifice or sacrifice,

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:02.170
and, I also saw a magic show once

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.760
and they had an audience plant.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.307
What if it's someone who raises her hand as like,

00:36:07.307 --> 00:36:12.230
"I'll volunteer," and this lovely woman walks out

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:16.030
and volunteers to be the human sacrifice and is brought,

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.760
you know, into the lava pit or whatever

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.690
and then all of a sudden wings sprout out of her

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.740
and she shoots up into the sky,

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.850
like it was a-- like it was planned or some--

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:25.943
I don't know.

00:36:25.943 --> 00:36:28.105
LAURA: That would be awesome.

00:36:28.105 --> 00:36:30.588
ASHLEY: I-- I mean, I could,

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:34.579
but I feel like these are still so new

00:36:34.579 --> 00:36:37.562
and I feel like I--

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:41.395
I don't want to betray the Storm Lord in any way.

00:36:41.395 --> 00:36:42.380
LAURA: Oh, right.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.450
ASHLEY: You know?

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.210
LAURA: That's true. What if, like,
you brought a bunch of followers

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.452
to the Moon Weaver and then he was like,

00:36:48.452 --> 00:36:50.310
"Fuck you, I'm taking the wings back."

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:51.143
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:36:51.143 --> 00:36:53.510
MARISHA: I just want to say, you know,

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.820
putting the human sacrifice thing, you know,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.490
you do it once and it goes on the calendar

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.323
and then there's going to be, like,

00:37:01.323 --> 00:37:04.070
a human sacrifice anniversary holiday.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.380
ASHLEY: And they'll keep doing it.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.390
MARISHA: And they'll keep doing it and then 20 years

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:11.220
like, Vokodo or Rumblecusp is known

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.500
for its cannibalism and human sacrifice.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.241
MATT: "You know what? I think, you're right. One Punch Girl

00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:17.370
"and Mr. Prayer Man over there probably have a better idea

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.500
"about this than I expected.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.410
"No sacrifice."

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.080
TALIESIN: I'm literally the descendant of people

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.830
who buried a head somewhere and this is sort of

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.398
how we ended up where we are.

00:37:26.398 --> 00:37:28.412
SAM: How about this, how about this, how about this?

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:31.023
We're spitballing here. There's no bad ideas.

00:37:31.023 --> 00:37:32.170
LAURA: I'm ready, I'm ready.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.003
LIAM: Pitch us again.

00:37:33.003 --> 00:37:34.269
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

00:37:34.269 --> 00:37:37.960
Because we do want them to give of themselves somehow.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.793
LAURA: Yeah!

00:37:38.793 --> 00:37:40.230
SAM: What if it's not sacrifice?

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.470
What if it's not killing, bloodletting, any of that stuff?

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.560
What if it's, like, a 24-hour sweat lodge

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.040
sort of like-- fasting--

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.990
MARISHA: Like dance off.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:54.062
SAM: Yeah, a 24-hour dance party-- a <i>48-hour</i> dance party.

00:37:54.062 --> 00:37:57.330
where people are dropping and dropping and dropping--
LAURA: Everybody has to dance.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.290
SAM: -- and can they make it, can they make it?

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.390
ASHLEY: You have to dance for your life.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.700
SAM: Someone will.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.110
And that person will sort of initiate

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.610
the rites of Ascension by--

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.320
MARISHA: Oh no, we're doing Midsommar again.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.761
Oh no, oh no.

00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:09.928
MATT: "Oh yes!"

00:38:11.799 --> 00:38:14.750
LAURA: What if we take all of the dick statues

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.680
that they made for you and instead of giving them away

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.341
as party favors, we hide them all around the village--

00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:23.719
MARISHA: Dick hunt!
LAURA: -- and you go on a dick hunt!

00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:24.780
MARISHA: Oh, that's great.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.613
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:25.613 --> 00:38:28.400
And then once all the dicks are found,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.790
then that triggers the Ascension.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.010
MARISHA: Sure, what if they find the dicks

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.320
and then they have to do a pilgrimage up the mountain

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.230
to the volcano and they have to toss their dick

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.063
in the volcano?

00:38:38.063 --> 00:38:39.760
LAURA: Oh, that's really good.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.890
MATT: "I'm not going to lie,

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.640
"this has already unlocked a beautiful, possible benefit

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.530
"to the design of this entire divinity thing.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.010
"Imagine if, hundreds of years from now,

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.420
"Sehanine themself, out of their control

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.670
"has had to absorb some sort of a dick festival

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.330
"into their worship, starting with this island.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.920
"The Moon Weaver's religion entirely altered.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.780
"I. Love. This. Plan."

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.030
LIAM: Dick sect.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.270
TALIESIN: How do you...

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:09.103
LAURA: How do you what?

00:39:09.103 --> 00:39:13.330
TALIESIN: How do you feel about a
human avatar, like, a chosen one?

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:17.450
You could always just pass a cloak onto that one

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.693
and then it would become-- I don't know if you want

00:39:19.693 --> 00:39:23.990
that kind of responsibility for being a high priest

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.800
of a god that's wandered off.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.890
LAURA: Well, I mean, I'm not opposed to it,

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:34.940
becoming, like, a high priestess, but--

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.950
SAM: Like a prophet.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.500
LAURA: The prophet of the Traveler?

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.333
SAM: Yeah.

00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:41.230
LAURA: But I would be basically-- anybody that came to me,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.367
I'd be like, "The Traveler's really cool...

00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:46.521
"worship the Moon Weaver?"

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.640
MATT: "And leave them questioning everything."

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.573
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I mean, it's--

00:39:50.573 --> 00:39:52.198
MATT: "There's upsides."
TALIESIN: -- on brand.

00:39:52.198 --> 00:39:54.930
TRAVIS: But also every single person trying to connect

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.820
with the Traveler will then come to you.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.140
LAURA: How would they even find me?

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.382
We travel around so much.

00:39:59.382 --> 00:40:01.580
TRAVIS: Don't you just send messages to some people

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.970
anywhere they are at any time?

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.220
LAURA: Well, yeah.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.480
TRAVIS: Seems like it might be easy.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:11.280
LAURA: For other people to do it?

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.562
TRAVIS: To find you.

00:40:12.562 --> 00:40:14.140
MATT: "There are quite a few people here who I've taught

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.872
"the same thing to."

00:40:15.872 --> 00:40:17.597
LAURA: Oh no.

00:40:17.597 --> 00:40:19.640
Why do you teach other people the cool stuff?

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.170
MATT: "Not every-- I didn't realize

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.415
"that was such an exclusive gift, my apologies."

00:40:23.415 --> 00:40:26.450
LAURA: Oh my god, it's the best.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.678
It's so much fun.

00:40:27.678 --> 00:40:29.358
MATT: "I can take it away, too. It is but my--"

00:40:29.358 --> 00:40:30.780
LAURA: Yeah, take it from them,

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.516
don't take it from me.
MATT: "All right, done."

00:40:32.516 --> 00:40:33.668
(laughter)

00:40:33.668 --> 00:40:34.501
LAURA: Did you really just take it

00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:35.601
away from them?
MATT: "Yeah!"

00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:38.070
TRAVIS: Somebody got their collect call hung up on.

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:41.455
MATT: "It's that easy."
SAM: Hello, hello?

00:40:41.455 --> 00:40:44.466
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:40:44.466 --> 00:40:46.824
That felt really good, but like, you know,

00:40:46.824 --> 00:40:51.510
I feel bad for them, but I feel good for myself.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.723
LIAM: So what is the plan?

00:40:52.723 --> 00:40:54.908
(laughter)

00:40:54.908 --> 00:40:56.187
SAM: We're making a stage.

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:57.216
LAURA: We're making a stage.
TRAVIS: We're killing everyone

00:40:57.216 --> 00:40:58.300
and making dicks.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.030
LAURA: We'll have Yasha play music. It'll be a big concert

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.166
when everybody gets here. It'll be a big show.

00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:05.640
SAM: Are we going to have them
make drumsticks during the week?

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.910
Is that a thing?
LAURA: Why not? We can have them make their own.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.480
We'll hide all of the dicks around the island,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.730
like around the village.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.596
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah and partly I understand--
LAURA: We should do that, like, today.

00:41:15.596 --> 00:41:18.896
LIAM: -- and dick drumming, it makes sense, but

00:41:18.896 --> 00:41:20.796
then how do you segue

00:41:20.796 --> 00:41:25.794
into freeing him from his fetters?

00:41:25.794 --> 00:41:27.226
into freeing him from his fetters?

00:41:27.226 --> 00:41:30.492
LAURA: Well, we have to, you know--

00:41:30.492 --> 00:41:32.530
everybody throws their dick

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.359
into the volcano or something.

00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:35.192
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:40.006
LAURA: And then you guys use your big illusions or whatever.

00:41:40.006 --> 00:41:40.900
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:45.900
LAURA: And make it seem like the Traveler...

00:41:46.081 --> 00:41:47.045
Maybe you could make it-- oh!

00:41:47.045 --> 00:41:49.600
Maybe you can make look like big green flames

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.840
come out of the volcano all of a sudden.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.673
SAM: Okay.

00:41:52.673 --> 00:41:56.280
LAURA: And then you, the Traveler,
you look like the Moon Weaver

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.587
and you fly down and you're like,

00:41:58.587 --> 00:42:00.930
"Hey, I'm attracted to this green flame."

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.122
I don't fucking know.
TALIESIN: Or you can fly up into the moon.

00:42:04.122 --> 00:42:05.820
MATT: "Eventually. I figured that'd
probably be the most likely--"

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.390
LAURA: Oh yeah, or to the-- you, uh-- yeah yeah.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.374
MATT: "An evening celebration may have to be important.

00:42:10.374 --> 00:42:12.500
"It's rather difficult to see either of the moons

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.498
"during the midday period.

00:42:15.858 --> 00:42:18.349
"The astronomy of space is a bit strange."
LAURA: I guess we don't have to

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:19.574
actually go to the volcano.

00:42:19.574 --> 00:42:21.230
We can just have everybody throw their dicks

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.480
into a fire or something.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.492
SAM: No no no, the volcano seems right.

00:42:24.492 --> 00:42:26.793
LAURA: It seems like a big thing, right?
SAM: Yes, you want a big set piece here.

00:42:26.793 --> 00:42:28.070
LIAM: It's so grand, you want it to be an event.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.720
And Caleb pulls out a bit of fleece

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.089
and casts Major Image and

00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:39.140
an illusion of the volcano--
in amber, of course-- hovering,

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.510
you know, like a model in front of us

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.830
and there are little arches, four of them

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.190
floating around the top and green flame coming out

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.520
of the amber volcano.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.390
A light show, Jester, is not a problem.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.910
We can make this place look like anything you want it to,

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:57.910
but I still don't understand the messaging, I suppose.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.038
SAM: Well, if we see the Traveler ascend

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.910
and the high priestess can sort of ascribe

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.830
any sort of meaning to it that she wants.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:09.360
LAURA: I know. "Oh my god!"
MATT: "Indeed. You would be

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.875
"the mouthpiece of the Moon Weaver.

00:43:10.875 --> 00:43:12.640
"That's what you would be.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.310
"The voice of the Traveler."

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.143
TALIESIN: She is blue--

00:43:15.143 --> 00:43:18.790
MARISHA: Maybe, you know, in order to pass on, you know

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:22.024
that your time as a deity has come

00:43:22.024 --> 00:43:26.070
and in order to pass on, you have to have, you know,

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.595
everyone do the dick trials

00:43:28.595 --> 00:43:30.845
and then that's the final--
MATT: "So wait.

00:43:31.967 --> 00:43:33.990
"A bit of confusion here on my point as well."

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.970
LIAM and TRAVIS: Just a bit?
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.770
MATT: "So, is it that the Traveler has secretly been

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.180
"the Moon Weaver this entire time,
or is it that the Traveler

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.120
"has decided to just give up to the Moon Weaver?

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.530
"Like, let's clarify the narrative here. I don't want us

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.971
"to cross wires in the middle of this.

00:43:52.971 --> 00:43:54.204
"It would be embarrassing."
LAURA: Let's just say you were

00:43:54.204 --> 00:43:56.010
the Moon Weaver the whole time.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.710
That's easier.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:58.543
MATT: "All right."

00:43:58.543 --> 00:44:01.070
LAURA: Let's say the Moon Weaver
has actually been helping us out

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.207
the whole time and it's all been, like, a big trick.

00:44:05.207 --> 00:44:08.370
"Oh, ha ha, just kidding. You're the Moon Weaver."

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.827
LIAM: Perhaps the message here is like,

00:44:09.827 --> 00:44:12.217
"Oh, you thought it was the Angel of Irons,

00:44:12.217 --> 00:44:14.848
"but surprise, buddy, it's actually the Chained Oblivion."

00:44:14.848 --> 00:44:15.681
LAURA: Yeah.

00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:19.140
MATT: "My apologies, there's an issue with the ship dealer.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.360
"There's some sort of a turtle thing. I'll be back shortly.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.494
"Workshop it a bit. I'll check in a few days.

00:44:24.494 --> 00:44:26.421
"Good luck."
SAM: I think we're almost there.

00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:27.510
MARISHA: Tell turtie we said hi.
MATT: And he vanishes.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.820
LIAM: Did he say he has to go do some turtling?

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.200
LAURA: He said that-- I think that the dragon turtle

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.770
is attacking another ship.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.363
MARISHA: Hey, maybe that'll cut down on the attendees!

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:40.007
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: That's already something in our favor.

00:44:40.007 --> 00:44:42.618
LIAM: This is so so much darker than I anticipated.

00:44:42.618 --> 00:44:43.451
TRAVIS: People die, people die.

00:44:43.451 --> 00:44:44.940
LAURA: Okay, okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, you're right.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.550
LAURA: So ultimate switcheroo. You know what?

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.080
I'm feeling better about this because

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.100
I'm not going to lie, you guys,

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.470
I was starting to feel really shitty

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.770
about duping a whole bunch of people, you know?

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.000
SAM: Aren't we still duping a bunch of--

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.450
LAURA: Yeah, but this way they're actually getting

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:03.710
a god out of it, you know?

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.020
SAM: Sure sure, I know that does make it better.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.200
LAURA: The thing that was really shitty was, like,

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.670
all these people are going to be basically praying

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.870
to Avocado, you know?

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:17.370
Like, stuck in this faith
that didn't actually mean anything.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.870
SAM: But now we're pointing them towards a real faith.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.250
LIAM: Well, only the people on this island were praying

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.760
to Vokodo. There are many more who're only dealing

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.310
with your friend before coming here.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.730
Maybe it is simply saying that this was,

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:37.500
we have come to find you to become a follower

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:41.220
of the Moon Weaver and that you
were, like, a recruiting system

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.970
and that it was a bit of an illusory front.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.470
Clearly you all were yearning for something more

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.660
in your life and helping others or spreading chaos

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:57.496
and you were starting a new sect of the Moon Weaver's faith.

00:45:57.496 --> 00:45:59.268
TRAVIS: And they have passed selection.

00:45:59.268 --> 00:46:00.101
SAM: Yeah.

00:46:00.101 --> 00:46:03.285
MARISHA: Also, considering that there aren't many approved

00:46:03.285 --> 00:46:06.200
deities in the empire, you could totally just say that

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.580
you had to--

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.413
TALIESIN: Fair point.

00:46:08.413 --> 00:46:11.337
MARISHA: -- use an alias in order
to protect the Moon Weaver.

00:46:11.337 --> 00:46:13.380
LAURA: Oh, right. is the Moon Weaver allowed in?

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.367
MARISHA: I don't know. Is the Moon Weaver one of them?

00:46:17.367 --> 00:46:19.276
MATT: Moon Weaver, I believe, is not one of

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.183
the sanctioned entities.

00:46:20.183 --> 00:46:22.041
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure the Moon Weaver isn't--

00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:24.437
TRAVIS: Trickery. Probably not.

00:46:24.437 --> 00:46:28.284
TALIESIN: I'm 80% sure the Moon Weaver was not allowed,

00:46:28.284 --> 00:46:30.380
90, I'm 90% sure.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.850
LAURA: I'm 95% sure.
TALIESIN: I'm sure now.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:36.190
Molly was a follower of the Moon Weaver and hid it, so...

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:38.139
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay, that's cool.

00:46:38.139 --> 00:46:39.089
TRAVIS: Do you remember Molly?
ASHLEY: But you could also,

00:46:39.089 --> 00:46:39.922
you could make them feel--

00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:42.410
TALIESIN: Remember Molly?
MARISHA: Yeah, remember him?

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.320
ASHLEY: You could make them feel super special, you know,

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.050
like, you are the select few that were so good

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.178
at practical jokes and things like that,

00:46:51.178 --> 00:46:54.520
that you were called here and the Moon Weaver wants <i>you</i>.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.520
LIAM: Yeah, and now you see what's behind the green door

00:46:59.542 --> 00:47:01.684
is the Moon Weaver.
LAURA: The Moon.

00:47:03.685 --> 00:47:05.485
TALIESIN: When is the full moon, by the way?

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:07.613
MATT: At this point?

00:47:07.613 --> 00:47:08.936
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:47:08.936 --> 00:47:10.510
SAM: Well, there's two moons so...

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.320
TALIESIN: The big moon.
SAM: Twice.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.240
MATT: Catha's next full moon is probably going to be

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.230
in about three weeks, but illusion can probably fix that

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.630
to a certain localized area.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:24.960
Ruidus is on the other side of the sky right now.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.388
TALIESIN: We wouldn't want to touch that anyway.

00:47:26.388 --> 00:47:29.430
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature check for me.

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:32.805
LAURA: Wait, I thought that the...

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.105
LIAM: Spill it.
TALIESIN: Ah, uh, one.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.418
TRAVIS: After your mod or natural?
TALIESIN: After my mod.

00:47:41.418 --> 00:47:44.088
It was a two. After my mod, it's a one.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.480
MATT: Yes, you were saying?

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.430
LAURA: No, no, no, I don't...

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:53.500
TALIESIN: I mean, the Moon Weaver is a good pick.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.608
It's trickery, but it's romantic and exciting and intimate

00:47:56.608 --> 00:47:58.949
It's trickery, but it's romantic and exciting and intimate

00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:03.949
and also, if I recall, she's blue in a lot of the stories.

00:48:04.024 --> 00:48:04.999
LAURA: She is?

00:48:04.999 --> 00:48:08.488
TALIESIN: If I recall. I'm a little fuzzy.

00:48:08.488 --> 00:48:11.221
LAURA: That's kind of cool.
TALIESIN: That is kind of cool.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.343
SAM: And when she appears or when he ascends, we could all,

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:21.220
you know, moon the Moon Weaver

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.163
as sort of like a final closing.

00:48:23.163 --> 00:48:25.774
LAURA: (dreamily) Yeah, I like it.

00:48:25.774 --> 00:48:27.054
MARISHA: I'm writing it down.

00:48:27.054 --> 00:48:29.440
(chuckles)

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.050
ASHLEY: There's a lot of solid plans here.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.955
SAM: I kind of feel like this is a good set.
ASHLEY: It's going to be a fun weekend, for sure.

00:48:34.955 --> 00:48:36.634
SAM: This was a good brainstorming session.

00:48:36.634 --> 00:48:38.830
LAURA: There might be some people that are annoyed

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:42.530
that they were tricked, but how can they really be that mad

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.330
that they were tricked by a god of trickery?

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:45.580
SAM: Absolutely.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.715
MARISHA: They knew what they were getting into.

00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:48.490
LAURA: Exactly.
TALIESIN: They were finding meaning in trickery.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.010
LIAM: Maybe we found an angle here.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.330
You have invited them here to this place that is safe

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:57.117
to form a new, more carefree sect of

00:48:57.117 --> 00:48:58.291
the faith of the Moon Weaver.

00:48:58.291 --> 00:48:59.773
SAM: Yeah, I love it.
LAURA: All right.

00:48:59.773 --> 00:49:01.310
TRAVIS: Did you ever ask the Traveler what

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:04.480
he's been telling people will happen at this island?

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.240
Like what people are expecting?

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.306
LAURA: I'm pretty sure...

00:49:11.981 --> 00:49:12.814
No.

00:49:13.887 --> 00:49:14.790
But you know what?

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.425
He's probably just been telling them the same thing

00:49:17.425 --> 00:49:22.425
that he told me which is,
"I'm getting my friends together."

00:49:22.697 --> 00:49:23.896
TALIESIN: That was a good imitation.

00:49:23.896 --> 00:49:25.082
LAURA: Thank you.

00:49:25.082 --> 00:49:26.107
TRAVIS: I just hope it's not like, you know,

00:49:26.107 --> 00:49:28.567
"You'll live forever or lots of money

00:49:28.567 --> 00:49:31.490
"or power beyond your wildest dreams."

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.830
Because then a deity switch really isn't going to satisfy

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.581
any of that shit.
LAURA: I don't think--

00:49:35.581 --> 00:49:39.302
that doesn't sound like something he would promise.

00:49:39.302 --> 00:49:41.920
Like, what's the point of that?

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.753
He might've done that.

00:49:42.753 --> 00:49:44.660
TRAVIS: He's generally full of shit, right?

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.493
LAURA: No!

00:49:45.493 --> 00:49:47.160
SAM: I feel like people know that though, right?

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:47.993
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:47.993 --> 00:49:49.680
LAURA: If you're worshiping him, you understand

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.740
what he is about, so...

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:57.965
SAM: Well, so we have, you know, the sketch of a plan here.

00:49:57.965 --> 00:49:59.830
Would you like to assign us any tasks

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.490
or should we just go about--?

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.760
LAURA: We should all take some of these dick statues

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.210
and I pull them out of my bag.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:07.960
Everybody, like, work on hiding these.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.210
TRAVIS: Should we also make people, like, gather wood

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.510
and whittle their own dicks, so you get, like, a variety?

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.180
MARISHA: Or are they making the dick drumsticks?

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.960
What about the dick drum making?

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.620
TALIESIN: You could paint them with fanciful paints.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.050
LIAM: I will save you time. I can
build dicks at a great scale.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.000
SAM: How?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:25.833
With magic?

00:50:25.833 --> 00:50:26.666
LIAM: Oh yes.

00:50:26.666 --> 00:50:27.630
SAM: You have a spell for that?

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:28.840
LIAM: Oh yeah.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.080
It's called Fabricate Dicks.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.557
TRAVIS: It's called dickcraft!

00:50:31.557 --> 00:50:33.460
LIAM: Well, it depends on what material, Jester,

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.571
you think would be best.

00:50:34.571 --> 00:50:37.180
Would you like it to be wood, or stone or...

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.670
LAURA: Oh, you mean for people to make their dick drums?

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:41.263
LIAM: I will make you dicks.

00:50:41.263 --> 00:50:45.688
LAURA: Well, I think part of the--
it's like arts and crafts,

00:50:45.688 --> 00:50:47.700
you know, they have to make their own dicks.

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.383
LIAM: I see.
TALIESIN: Oh, you can decorate them.

00:50:49.383 --> 00:50:51.340
SAM: So we can go gather some wood.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.130
We could gather some wooden materials in preparation

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.910
and when they get here, they can pick a pile from the wood

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.850
and pick some paints and pick some brushes

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:01.790
and go off and make their own thing.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.550
MARISHA: Do we have, like, glue?

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:05.133
SAM: We can find some.
MARISHA: Do we have glitter?

00:51:05.133 --> 00:51:06.506
MATT: The weirdest Color Me Mine ever.

00:51:06.506 --> 00:51:08.121
(laughter)

00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:09.521
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah!

00:51:09.521 --> 00:51:10.389
MARISHA: Okay.

00:51:10.389 --> 00:51:12.084
SAM: Yeah, we can come up with that stuff, right?

00:51:12.084 --> 00:51:16.670
We could boil some ... h-h-horse to make some glue.

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.686
I don't know how people made glue.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.210
TRAVIS: Boil some horse?

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:24.185
SAM: Well, I don't know, how do you make glue in D&amp;D times?

00:51:24.185 --> 00:51:26.435
(laughter)
LIAM: D&amp;D times?

00:51:27.443 --> 00:51:28.683
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: I don't know.

00:51:28.683 --> 00:51:30.295
LIAM: Year what, 1982?

00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:35.120
(laughter)

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.160
SAM: We can figure it out though.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.410
ASHLEY: We could grind down some of the flowers for paint.

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:42.160
SAM: Oh, that's a good idea.
MARISHA: That's great.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:42.993
LAURA: That's great.

00:51:42.993 --> 00:51:47.030
MARISHA: We could maybe-- it would be expensive glitter

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.020
if you shaved down some of the jewels to make.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.370
LAURA: Yeah, that would be, like, jewel dust.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:52.940
MARISHA: That's too much for a volcano.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.791
LAURA: Yeah.

00:51:53.791 --> 00:51:55.280
TALIESIN: You could just get some oyster shell and--

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.510
MARISHA: So I do have a question, though.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.080
How long do you want this event, overall?

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.470
Is it two days.
LAURA: Oh, probably like a day,

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:03.420
two days, nothing crazy.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.720
MARISHA: Like a weekend?

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.030
LAURA: Yeah, I don't want it to be, like, a week long thing

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.163
of people, like, beating their dicks, you know,

00:52:10.163 --> 00:52:11.260
just a couple days.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.870
LIAM: Nobody wants to beat their dick for a week.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:13.860
LAURA: Not a week straight.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.118
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: That will tire you out.

00:52:15.118 --> 00:52:16.359
ASHLEY: They'll get very tired, yeah.

00:52:16.359 --> 00:52:17.510
LIAM: Chafes after awhile.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.570
TRAVIS: Flour and water is how
you make glue, flour and water.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.168
SAM: We can do that; we've got a kitchen here.

00:52:22.168 --> 00:52:23.885
LAURA: That's easy, that's how you make paste.

00:52:23.885 --> 00:52:25.910
That's why it's fun to eat paste when you're little.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:27.210
It's just flour and water.

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.330
TRAVIS: Did you do that a lot?

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:30.540
LAURA: Maybe.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:33.620
MARISHA: Here's all the plans that everyone has tossed out

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:37.063
that I wrote down, so this is on the white board

00:52:37.063 --> 00:52:38.230
in front of us.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:43.230
Make a stage, make dick drumsticks, have a dance off,

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:47.620
beat the drums with the dick drumsticks, dick hunt,

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.970
dick volcano trial, ultimate switcheroo,

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.550
Traveler is the Moon Weaver, moon the Moon Weaver.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:56.330
LIAM: Dick Hunt is so much better than Duck Hunt.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:57.870
SAM: I used to play that. Dick Hunt.

00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.736
LIAM: Dick Hunt.
TRAVIS: (quacking)

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.550
LAURA: Those are all solid.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.510
SAM: I feel like that's a plan.

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:05.343
MARISHA: That's the plan, right?

00:53:05.343 --> 00:53:06.610
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:08.999
LIAM: Well, I can set your stage and the dicks

00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:10.890
and I can handle any light shows you need.

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:12.710
LAURA: Amazing, I think we'll definitely need

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:15.790
a good light show because Yasha is going to be playing.

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:16.660
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.410
LAURA: Can you play, like, really upbeat, you know,

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:21.120
like rock sort of stuff?

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.100
ASHLEY: Absolutely.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.430
TRAVIS: Eurovision touch.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.060
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, all of it.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.435
LIAM: Yasha is so Eurovision.

00:53:26.435 --> 00:53:28.527
LAURA: (laughs) Yasha is so Eurovision.
TALIESIN: Very Eurovision.

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:32.390
SAM: Who's in charge of building the stage?

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:36.850
LAURA: Well, I was thinking we could get Kellbast

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:39.210
to help us out because he's a furniture maker.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:40.043
SAM: Okay.

00:53:40.043 --> 00:53:43.740
LAURA: If Caleb can make a stage, no problem.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.270
TALIESIN: I'll also say in the interest of doing

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.530
a little bit more good, we could start talking

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:51.040
to some of the people who were planning on staying behind

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:54.720
and seeing if they want to participate

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.500
in getting things together, maybe starting

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.769
to build some stuff so that when people come to visit

00:54:00.769 --> 00:54:03.385
there's more things to come and visit with,

00:54:03.385 --> 00:54:05.750
like hopefully we'll leave the stage for them

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.367
and put it somewhere reasonable, so that others can come

00:54:08.367 --> 00:54:09.200
and enjoy it.

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.012
MARISHA: Like a permanent outdoor amphitheater?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:54:11.012 --> 00:54:12.511
MARISHA: I like that.
LAURA: Yeah, that would be wonderful

00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:14.394
so they can do concerts and stuff?

00:54:14.394 --> 00:54:16.330
SAM: And converting some of their old lodgings

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:17.740
into more sort of hotels.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:19.800
TALIESIN: Since a bunch of them are empty now.
LAURA: I've already talked to them about that.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.633
SAM: Great, great.

00:54:20.633 --> 00:54:22.977
LAURA: We do need to get some of them to like--

00:54:22.977 --> 00:54:25.760
that's probably, like, 200 people. That's a lot of food

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.830
and we don't want to just serve

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.527
like cheese sandwiches or anything.

00:54:28.527 --> 00:54:31.680
So we should get hunting parties together

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.755
and actually cook stuff.

00:54:33.755 --> 00:54:35.712
Or we could just Create Food and Water.

00:54:35.712 --> 00:54:36.950
TRAVIS: Oh, all we have to do is hunt one of

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:39.280
those giant walking lizards that we saw on the way

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.320
to the volcano. They'll feed everybody.
SAM: Ooh.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.380
TALIESIN: Let's just find out if they're tasty.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.213
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:54:44.213 --> 00:54:47.190
ASHLEY: I bet they're-- I mean, I might be biased,

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:48.865
but I bet they're probably delicious.

00:54:48.865 --> 00:54:49.713
TRAVIS: You're biased?

00:54:49.713 --> 00:54:51.146
SAM: You have pretty good taste.

00:54:51.146 --> 00:54:52.830
ASHLEY: I feel like I've had one before.

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.726
(laughter)

00:54:54.726 --> 00:54:56.884
TRAVIS: DM, have I eaten a T-Rex before?

00:54:56.884 --> 00:54:58.749
(laughter)

00:54:58.749 --> 00:55:03.290
ASHLEY: Oh, a T-Rex. I thought you meant those other things.

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.491
That was good, probably not a lot of meat on the arms.

00:55:05.491 --> 00:55:07.560
(laughter)

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.671
ASHLEY: But the rest of it.

00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:10.257
LIAM: It's all about the tail.

00:55:10.257 --> 00:55:12.210
ASHLEY: It's all about the tail.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:13.494
TALIESIN: Tail is a delicacy.
MATT: All right.

00:55:13.494 --> 00:55:15.670
MARISHA: So we do want to try and hold this convention

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:17.841
in downtown Vo?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:55:17.841 --> 00:55:19.550
MARISHA: Not, like, 30 minutes outside the city?

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:20.739
LAURA: No, it should be in Vo.

00:55:20.739 --> 00:55:21.575
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: It should be in Vo.

00:55:21.575 --> 00:55:23.250
The thing is, it's going to be difficult

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:26.700
if we do make the trek up the volcano with everybody

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.290
to put it in the volcano. Like, that's a trek, y'all.

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:32.890
And some of these people may not be very, you know,

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:35.000
physically active. I don't know.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.100
TALIESIN: They made it here.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.170
MARISHA: They might die on the way.

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:39.310
LAURA: Yeah, but they made it here on a boat.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:40.847
TRAVIS: Yeah, what does happen if they fall into

00:55:40.847 --> 00:55:44.080
any one of the traps that were out there, the liquid,

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.130
the beasts, sea?

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:47.310
I mean, do we feel responsible for that

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.905
because they're throwing dicks into a volcano?

00:55:49.905 --> 00:55:52.010
(laughter)

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.840
LIAM: Although conversely, a pilgrimage and some difficulty

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.050
could make it feel earned and worthwhile.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:58.300
SAM: Yep.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.360
MARISHA: But we will be escorting, like, 200 people

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.070
and some will definitely die.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:05.860
LIAM: Not definitely, probably.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.109
MARISHA: Right.
TRAVIS: Most likely.

00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:10.018
SAM: If you'd like, one of us could try

00:56:10.018 --> 00:56:13.983
to blaze a trail or take some of the VO community up there

00:56:13.983 --> 00:56:16.200
and try to blaze the trail up.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.100
LAURA: That's true. We could spend
some of the days prepping that.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.150
MARISHA: Make some water stations along the way,

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:23.200
some check marks.
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, good idea.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.380
LAURA: Maybe now that Avocado's gone,

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.250
maybe some of this stuff will get better here?

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:30.210
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.480
LAURA: I don't know, maybe he was causing it to continue.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.070
I don't know.

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:37.260
TRAVIS: I think he only came through a certain way.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.100
I don't think he caused it, right?

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.530
This seems to be a--

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:41.363
LAURA: Oh no, he did.

00:56:41.363 --> 00:56:43.197
He brought all the shards down with him.

00:56:43.197 --> 00:56:45.442
TRAVIS: Oh, I paid really close attention.

00:56:45.442 --> 00:56:47.470
(laughter)

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.040
MARISHA: But the shards are probably still here.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.540
It's probably all still--

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.232
TALIESIN: They are, as far as I can remember.
ASHLEY: Did we go to the mine?

00:56:52.232 --> 00:56:54.600
LAURA: We didn't go to the mine.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.530
ASHLEY: I knew that.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:59.088
LAURA: But that just led to the Underdark. Scary creatures.

00:56:59.088 --> 00:56:59.921
TRAVIS: "Just"?

00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:01.850
SAM: Yeah, but they also said they had lots of jewels

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:03.672
and stuff there.

00:57:03.672 --> 00:57:04.668
Some shinnies.

00:57:04.668 --> 00:57:06.468
TRAVIS: It's hard for the video gamer in me.
LIAM: How important is that glitter?

00:57:06.468 --> 00:57:07.487
TRAVIS: I really want to go.

00:57:07.487 --> 00:57:10.428
SAM: We can get a lot of glitter.
TRAVIS: Look at that corner.

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:12.990
SAM: A lot of glitter.

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:15.260
MARISHA: New plan: the trial is to the mine,

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:19.080
they have to mine some gems, we get to keep the gems,

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.110
trial done.

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:23.750
LAURA: Then once we get to the volcano,

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:26.970
how does everybody get to the top of the volcano?

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.440
Is there, like, a path so everyone can get up there

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.860
or do I need to fly every single person up

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.430
and down the mountain to throw their dick in?

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:38.965
That could be really fun; like, we have a couple of

00:57:38.965 --> 00:57:41.540
big flying creatures.

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.320
We each grab a couple of people, fly them up,

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.010
throw your dick in while you're in the air,

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:47.768
if you can make it, you win.

00:57:47.768 --> 00:57:48.818
LIAM: Dick drop.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:57:48.818 --> 00:57:50.260
The dick drop into the volcano

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.745
and fly back down, grab a couple more and go back.

00:57:52.745 --> 00:57:55.780
MATT: Caduceus, Beauregard, Caleb, it is this moment

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.010
you realize that Vilya has been standing at the door

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:00.510
for an undisclosed period of time

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.885
and steps in very carefully.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.170
"I don't mean to interrupt."

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:07.003
TALIESIN: It's just dicks.

00:58:07.003 --> 00:58:10.092
MATT: "Nor am I going to ask for clarification."

00:58:10.092 --> 00:58:11.580
ASHLEY: That's probably a good idea.

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.263
MATT: "But I am about to send the first batch."

00:58:15.263 --> 00:58:16.980
SAM: Oh, oh, oh!

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:17.813
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

00:58:17.813 --> 00:58:18.655
MATT: "If you wish to join."

00:58:18.655 --> 00:58:21.079
LAURA: How many people are in the first batch?

00:58:21.079 --> 00:58:22.460
MATT: "First batch is 13."

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:23.470
TRAVIS: And where are they going?

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.060
MATT: "They're heading to the Menagerie Coast."

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.100
LAURA: We grab 13 of the little 50 gold bags.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:28.933
MATT: Okay.

00:58:28.933 --> 00:58:30.662
LAURA: And we give them to her? Okay.

00:58:30.662 --> 00:58:34.570
Make sure you hand them to each person as they go.

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:37.405
Should we hold them and give them as they go through?

00:58:37.405 --> 00:58:39.100
MATT: "I can handle it, unless you wish to come along.

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:39.933
"That's up to you."

00:58:39.933 --> 00:58:42.620
TRAVIS: I think we probably
should. We are handing out coins.

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.255
LAURA: We should go and protect and make sure that

00:58:44.255 --> 00:58:46.312
people don't notice that you're doing it because that--

00:58:46.312 --> 00:58:47.378
MATT: "Fair enough, good call."

00:58:47.378 --> 00:58:50.145
SAM: Vilya, I had a question actually.
MATT: "Yes?"

00:58:50.145 --> 00:58:55.092
SAM: Say you do this tree spell and the portal opens up on

00:58:55.092 --> 00:58:58.180
this end at the tree and the portal opens up on a tree

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:01.627
in the Menagerie Coast somewhere.

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:06.350
People go one way through, right?

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:10.360
If someone's standing at the Menagerie Coast tree,

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.540
will they see a portal open and if so,

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.950
can they come back the other way

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.753
during those same six seconds?

00:59:15.954 --> 00:59:17.454
MATT: "They could."

00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:18.904
SAM: Huh.

00:59:18.904 --> 00:59:20.504
MATT: "Well, they can try.

00:59:20.504 --> 00:59:24.074
"I'm on this end and I have my ways
of keeping things at bay."

00:59:24.074 --> 00:59:25.574
The wind (whooshes)

00:59:25.574 --> 00:59:28.154
kicks up a bit in the space before dying down.

00:59:28.154 --> 00:59:30.408
LAURA: But what if you knew where the tree was

00:59:30.408 --> 00:59:31.424
and you wanted somebody to come?

00:59:31.424 --> 00:59:33.772
SAM: Yeah, I was specifically thinking

00:59:33.772 --> 00:59:36.634
if I went with one of these groups,

00:59:36.634 --> 00:59:39.084
could I then come back the next day

00:59:39.084 --> 00:59:40.897
if you opened it at the same time?

00:59:42.574 --> 00:59:44.954
MATT: "It's going to be at different locations.

00:59:44.954 --> 00:59:47.354
"We're breaking them up by whoever's heading where.

00:59:47.354 --> 00:59:50.404
"I'm getting them closest to where they need to be.

00:59:50.404 --> 00:59:54.074
"I mean, I could, perhaps, towards the end of the week.

00:59:54.074 --> 00:59:56.774
"We have it broken down into five batches."

00:59:56.774 --> 00:59:57.724
SAM: Never mind.

00:59:57.724 --> 00:59:59.744
That's good to know, that's good to know.

00:59:59.744 --> 01:00:02.644
TRAVIS: And just for clarity, your five locations

01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:05.034
are the Menagerie Coast and where else?

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.834
MATT: "Menagerie Coast.

01:00:06.834 --> 01:00:09.657
"We have on the eastern side of Tal'Dorei.

01:00:10.914 --> 01:00:15.784
"I have outside of Asarius in Xhorhas.

01:00:15.784 --> 01:00:19.454
"I'm having to scry for some of these locations

01:00:19.454 --> 01:00:20.664
"of which I've not visited.

01:00:20.664 --> 01:00:24.374
"I'm finding a tree in the vicinity and choosing that.

01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:28.554
"One that's on the outskirts of Zadash.

01:00:28.554 --> 01:00:33.554
"And then, one that is on the western coast of Marquet."

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:35.164
LAURA: Oh wow.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:38.476
MATT: "Those are the five locations that have been chosen."

01:00:38.476 --> 01:00:39.834
SAM: Wow.

01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:42.084
LIAM: What is this eastern location in Tal'Dorei?

01:00:43.854 --> 01:00:45.014
MATT: "They said eastern Tal'Dorei,

01:00:45.014 --> 01:00:48.977
"so I'm choosing one place I'm familiar with,

01:00:50.144 --> 01:00:53.737
"far from the base of a mountain range from where I'm from.

01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:59.134
"We'll be leaving soon with the first batch.

01:00:59.134 --> 01:01:01.994
"If you wish to come, now's the time."
SAM: Yes, yes. Let's go say goodbye.

01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:03.044
TALIESIN: A little fresh air.

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:05.537
MATT: "All right."

01:01:07.022 --> 01:01:09.234
LAURA: Hey, Vilya, how long do you plan on staying here?

01:01:09.234 --> 01:01:12.554
Are you leaving immediately after the last group is gone?

01:01:12.554 --> 01:01:13.734
I say as we're walking out.

01:01:13.734 --> 01:01:15.088
MATT: Right (chuckling).

01:01:16.444 --> 01:01:19.174
"I think, once the affairs have set here at the village

01:01:19.174 --> 01:01:20.774
"then I'll probably be on my way.

01:01:21.654 --> 01:01:24.204
"I'll stay to help with whatever you're doing

01:01:24.204 --> 01:01:26.724
"with your event, should you need me.

01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:30.974
"Otherwise, I think once I feel like the village

01:01:30.974 --> 01:01:33.004
"is in a good place, I might be comfortable

01:01:33.004 --> 01:01:37.987
"to return to whatever remains of my life."

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:43.794
LAURA: They're going to be so happy to see you, I'm sure.

01:01:43.794 --> 01:01:47.058
MATT: "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't anxious.

01:01:47.058 --> 01:01:48.391
"I don't quite know what to expect."

01:01:48.391 --> 01:01:51.094
SAM: Have you made contact with them at all?

01:01:51.094 --> 01:01:52.335
MATT: "No."

01:01:53.694 --> 01:01:55.427
LAURA: Do you have any way to?

01:01:59.234 --> 01:02:00.744
MATT: "I'm not sure.

01:02:04.674 --> 01:02:09.404
"I think I've been pushing the thought off for a while

01:02:09.404 --> 01:02:10.874
"and just focusing on what's ahead of me.

01:02:10.874 --> 01:02:13.354
"I'll deal with that when we get there, for right now.

01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:14.187
"It might be best

01:02:14.187 --> 01:02:18.359
"to tear the bandages off when the moment comes.

01:02:19.934 --> 01:02:22.694
LAURA: I can send a message, if you want me to.

01:02:22.694 --> 01:02:23.694
MATT: "I appreciate that.

01:02:24.843 --> 01:02:28.091
"We'll wait for now, but thank you.

01:02:29.384 --> 01:02:31.517
"Anyway, come, come, follow me."

01:02:31.517 --> 01:02:34.364
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, let's hand out some goody bags.

01:02:34.364 --> 01:02:35.894
MATT: You guys join in with this crew.

01:02:35.894 --> 01:02:36.994
A few people you noticed,

01:02:36.994 --> 01:02:39.626
they're mostly like the standard villagers here.

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:42.524
Two people that do catch your eye are

01:02:42.524 --> 01:02:46.944
Captain Deramid Thrune or Lukash, as you knew him,

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:49.669
as well as Kotho (Terra)

01:02:49.669 --> 01:02:52.335
and her team are part of this troop.

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:53.492
TRAVIS: They're going to go?
MATT: Yeah.

01:02:53.492 --> 01:02:55.804
They're all Menagerie Coast locals

01:02:55.804 --> 01:02:57.334
who are going there directly.

01:02:57.334 --> 01:02:59.402
LAURA: Oh wow, so, they don't have to take a boat.

01:02:59.402 --> 01:03:00.854
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Wow.

01:03:00.854 --> 01:03:03.970
TRAVIS: Can I go catch Kotho real quick before they leave?

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:06.444
MATT: Sure, yeah, as everyone's gathering and Vilya

01:03:06.444 --> 01:03:10.224
is beginning to make everyone over towards where

01:03:10.224 --> 01:03:13.864
the large tree that she's chosen for the exit would be,

01:03:13.864 --> 01:03:15.514
you saunter up to next to Kotho.

01:03:16.384 --> 01:03:20.004
TRAVIS: I thought you needed a ship to leave the island.

01:03:20.004 --> 01:03:22.544
I see you've found other means of transportation.

01:03:22.544 --> 01:03:24.784
MATT: "It appears there are other means
of getting off this rock.

01:03:24.784 --> 01:03:28.724
"So we're taking the most direct, most recent way."

01:03:28.724 --> 01:03:30.524
TRAVIS: Right, right.

01:03:30.524 --> 01:03:34.274
Will you continue on your last search?

01:03:34.274 --> 01:03:37.124
MATT: "I don't even know if that contract still remains.

01:03:37.124 --> 01:03:38.114
"I'll check into it."

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:43.114
TRAVIS: Could I ask, how much does a contract

01:03:43.304 --> 01:03:46.814
with the infamous Kotho go for?

01:03:46.814 --> 01:03:48.804
MATT: "Depends on what's requested of the contract.

01:03:48.804 --> 01:03:51.204
"Why, are you looking to be a client?"

01:03:53.134 --> 01:03:57.334
TRAVIS: There is someone that I would like found,

01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:00.634
but I don't know if I feel like

01:04:00.634 --> 01:04:04.079
dedicating my particular time to.

01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:06.962
Someone that betrayed my trust a while back

01:04:06.962 --> 01:04:09.644
and also came out of the Menagerie Coast.

01:04:09.644 --> 01:04:14.010
I figure, if you're going to our mutual homestead,

01:04:14.924 --> 01:04:17.034
perhaps I could put a little extra coin

01:04:17.034 --> 01:04:18.884
in your pocket on your way.

01:04:18.884 --> 01:04:21.154
MATT: Kotho, really for the first time

01:04:21.154 --> 01:04:23.674
since all the times you've interacted,

01:04:23.674 --> 01:04:27.557
really gives a strong once-over, looking at your equipment,

01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:30.364
basically summing you up as an individual,

01:04:30.364 --> 01:04:33.214
based on what you wear and what you have on you and goes,

01:04:36.204 --> 01:04:39.064
"You seem to be into getting into trouble

01:04:39.064 --> 01:04:42.477
"and have made some acquisitions in the process.

01:04:45.634 --> 01:04:49.184
"Do you just need this person
found and brought back to you?"

01:04:49.184 --> 01:04:51.964
TRAVIS: I don't even know if I need them brought back.

01:04:51.964 --> 01:04:56.357
Perhaps just their position relayed, a head start.

01:04:57.494 --> 01:05:00.394
MATT: "Do you have any specific means

01:05:00.394 --> 01:05:02.564
"of instruction you would like?

01:05:02.564 --> 01:05:05.597
"In person, by letter, or by magic?"

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.344
TRAVIS: That is quite a variety of options.

01:05:09.344 --> 01:05:10.177
Magic, I think.

01:05:10.177 --> 01:05:13.184
MATT: "Variety of payments, as well."

01:05:13.184 --> 01:05:14.225
TRAVIS: Right.

01:05:15.214 --> 01:05:19.164
Magic, as we tend to move quite a bit.

01:05:19.164 --> 01:05:19.997
MATT: "All right.

01:05:22.534 --> 01:05:24.117
"We'll put it at...

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:29.633
"200 gold down payment

01:05:29.633 --> 01:05:31.574
"with an additional 100 upon completion."

01:05:33.004 --> 01:05:34.337
TRAVIS: That is a mighty price.

01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:36.448
MARISHA: (whispered) That's expensive.

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:38.895
TRAVIS: You have a deal.

01:05:39.904 --> 01:05:40.737
MATT: Hand extends.

01:05:41.599 --> 01:05:42.932
TRAVIS: 200 gold.

01:05:43.884 --> 01:05:45.324
MATT: Shakes it for a second.

01:05:45.324 --> 01:05:47.134
Puts it away in her pouch.

01:05:47.134 --> 01:05:49.755
"So, who am I hunting?"

01:05:50.844 --> 01:05:55.079
TRAVIS: There is a half-elf individual named Sabian

01:05:55.079 --> 01:05:58.174
that was a crew member on my ship, the Tide's Breath.

01:05:58.174 --> 01:06:00.944
Our captain was named Vandran.

01:06:00.944 --> 01:06:02.444
He betrayed our trust.

01:06:02.444 --> 01:06:04.087
I have not seen him since.

01:06:04.984 --> 01:06:08.424
The last time he was seen, he was in Port Damali.

01:06:10.244 --> 01:06:15.244
Any information would be most appreciated.

01:06:16.035 --> 01:06:19.034
MATT: Okay. Kotho asks for some more details,

01:06:19.034 --> 01:06:22.244
specifically about what he looked like, general disposition.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:26.474
You give a detailed recounting of Sabian.

01:06:26.474 --> 01:06:28.169
Eventually, Kotho goes,

01:06:28.169 --> 01:06:30.232
"All right, I think I have enough to act on.

01:06:30.232 --> 01:06:33.664
"I know a few folks I can ask the right questions to

01:06:33.664 --> 01:06:36.917
"that can probably definitely set me on the right path.

01:06:38.944 --> 01:06:40.235
"Give me a month."

01:06:42.219 --> 01:06:44.101
TRAVIS: A month you have.

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:45.701
MATT: "Very well."
TRAVIS: I wish you luck.

01:06:48.654 --> 01:06:49.937
MATT: "I don't need it."

01:06:51.834 --> 01:06:55.164
She turns and you can see now, they've reached the tree.

01:06:55.164 --> 01:06:58.044
As everyone gathers, Vilya goes,

01:06:58.044 --> 01:07:00.454
"All right, once it's open, be quick.

01:07:00.454 --> 01:07:04.044
"Single file, do not push, do not dilly dally.

01:07:04.044 --> 01:07:07.986
"I'd hate for any of you to be
caught in the tree when it closes.

01:07:07.986 --> 01:07:09.964
"(chuckling) No, seriously, don't do that.

01:07:09.964 --> 01:07:10.814
"It will kill you.

01:07:12.014 --> 01:07:13.672
"All right?"

01:07:13.672 --> 01:07:15.397
She takes the staff and places it down

01:07:15.397 --> 01:07:16.874
and like the zipper, you see the doorway

01:07:16.874 --> 01:07:18.773
open up on the outside of a tree.

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:22.454
(whooshing) You glance past her and you can see,

01:07:22.454 --> 01:07:25.464
on the other side of this, a shoreline.

01:07:25.464 --> 01:07:29.424
Beach crashing against white sands.

01:07:29.424 --> 01:07:32.294
You see bits of rock emerging in the nearby rough

01:07:32.294 --> 01:07:34.264
where waves are smashing and spraying

01:07:34.264 --> 01:07:36.174
sea mist into the air nearby.

01:07:36.174 --> 01:07:38.724
You can just see barely in the distance

01:07:38.724 --> 01:07:41.604
the exterior of a seaside city.

01:07:41.604 --> 01:07:43.524
As everyone rushes through, the last thing you see

01:07:43.524 --> 01:07:46.744
is Kotho and her troop making their final steps past

01:07:46.744 --> 01:07:49.831
before Kotho looks back at you and gives you a nod.

01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:51.211
(clapping) It closes.

01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:53.038
LAURA: Did they get their bags?

01:07:53.038 --> 01:07:55.814
MATT: Yes, their bags were part of the
process of getting out.

01:07:55.814 --> 01:07:57.262
(grunting)

01:07:57.262 --> 01:08:00.179
(laughter)

01:08:01.854 --> 01:08:03.394
The first batch is done.

01:08:03.394 --> 01:08:05.354
For the portion of this week that's going by,

01:08:05.354 --> 01:08:07.524
as opposed to feel like you have to role play

01:08:07.524 --> 01:08:10.114
every single moment of each at the end of this week,

01:08:10.114 --> 01:08:11.964
we will go through certain moments you want to do,

01:08:11.964 --> 01:08:14.284
any interactions you want to have.

01:08:14.284 --> 01:08:17.584
I'll go day to day and you tell me what you want to do.

01:08:17.584 --> 01:08:20.734
If it's simple or it's more elaborate, just let me know.

01:08:20.734 --> 01:08:21.614
For the remainder of this day,

01:08:21.614 --> 01:08:23.447
is there anything else you would like to do?

01:08:24.294 --> 01:08:28.214
SAM: I've mapped out all 21 meals of the seven days

01:08:28.214 --> 01:08:31.244
that I would like to prepare each individually.

01:08:31.244 --> 01:08:32.185
No.

01:08:32.185 --> 01:08:34.674
(laughter)

01:08:34.674 --> 01:08:37.199
I don't know. We've got to do stuff for you.

01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:40.574
LAURA: Yeah, I'll go around and ask the villagers

01:08:40.574 --> 01:08:42.634
that are staying, like the old lady,

01:08:42.634 --> 01:08:45.354
if she'll be the chef at the resort and if

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:48.636
she'll help prepare food for the con and everything.

01:08:48.636 --> 01:08:50.979
MATT: Yeah, that's easy enough.

01:08:52.575 --> 01:08:55.204
Anola agrees to help out.

01:08:55.204 --> 01:08:57.034
There are a lot of people here in the village

01:08:57.034 --> 01:08:58.334
that are staying that are eager to help.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:01.672
Both because you've done them a great service

01:09:01.672 --> 01:09:04.244
and because they're excited to meet new folk.

01:09:04.244 --> 01:09:05.954
Some that they believe, maybe they want to stay, too,

01:09:05.954 --> 01:09:07.684
and take the place of those that are leaving.

01:09:07.684 --> 01:09:10.874
Since it will feel a partially hollow village,

01:09:10.874 --> 01:09:11.707
for the time being,

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:15.810
with more than half of them leaving throughout the week.

01:09:16.704 --> 01:09:20.744
Supplies are being gathered and reaped for the stage

01:09:20.744 --> 01:09:23.924
that's beginning to be built out and constructed.

01:09:23.924 --> 01:09:25.124
TALIESIN: I'm going to help with a little Stone Shape

01:09:25.124 --> 01:09:28.998
to give it a dome back.

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:30.529
LAURA: Ooh, like an amphitheater sort of thing.

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:31.670
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:09:33.214 --> 01:09:35.644
LIAM: I can shape, I just need the raw materials.

01:09:35.644 --> 01:09:39.494
If we get enough wood for me to manipulate,

01:09:39.494 --> 01:09:40.914
I can create such a stage.

01:09:40.914 --> 01:09:43.354
I can create such a half dome.

01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:44.724
It will be fluid, curved,

01:09:44.724 --> 01:09:46.644
we're not talking a rectangular box.

01:09:46.644 --> 01:09:50.124
If you want, we can have phallic protrusions in places,

01:09:50.124 --> 01:09:52.204
if you think that would enhance the--

01:09:52.204 --> 01:09:54.624
TALIESIN: I think maybe we just leave it a little decorative

01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:56.374
so that they can use it for other things, as well.

01:09:56.374 --> 01:09:57.207
LAURA: Oh, that's true,

01:09:57.207 --> 01:09:59.374
because we are leaving it here.
LIAM: Now we're going to fap back on the dicks.

01:09:59.374 --> 01:10:01.046
(laughter)

01:10:01.046 --> 01:10:03.814
MARISHA: Whoa, too much dicks. (scoffs)

01:10:03.814 --> 01:10:05.155
TRAVIS: Easy, Caleb.

01:10:06.727 --> 01:10:09.091
LIAM: Look, I just like dicks, okay?

01:10:09.091 --> 01:10:11.187
On day one--
MATT: We've hit critical dicks.

01:10:11.187 --> 01:10:13.734
LIAM: At some point, Caleb will take Jester

01:10:13.734 --> 01:10:15.784
to the main entrance to town and say:

01:10:15.784 --> 01:10:18.594
Now, I will show you one thing here today.

01:10:18.594 --> 01:10:22.254
And with every day that passes, under your direction,

01:10:22.254 --> 01:10:24.174
we will do this wherever you want on the island.

01:10:24.174 --> 01:10:27.834
And I will cast Programmed Illusion.

01:10:27.834 --> 01:10:29.234
This is just going to stay here.

01:10:29.234 --> 01:10:34.124
A huge 30-foot-tall Traveler's gate

01:10:34.124 --> 01:10:37.357
appears over the entrance to Vo.

01:10:37.357 --> 01:10:41.974
It is colorful the same way that the Playa at night is.

01:10:41.974 --> 01:10:46.534
Vibrant, vibrant green gate.

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:49.574
Any time a person walks through it,

01:10:49.574 --> 01:10:54.394
there's a little silent explosion of little hamster unicorns

01:10:54.394 --> 01:10:56.244
that explode out of the side of it

01:10:56.244 --> 01:10:59.447
as well as little blue moons, like Lucky Charms.

01:11:00.574 --> 01:11:02.461
Also, little

01:11:04.438 --> 01:11:06.044
penises.

01:11:06.044 --> 01:11:06.877
Very small.

01:11:06.877 --> 01:11:08.404
You might think that they are butterflies,

01:11:08.404 --> 01:11:09.284
but if you look close, they are penises.

01:11:09.284 --> 01:11:10.814
LAURA: Their balls are flapping?

01:11:10.814 --> 01:11:12.770
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, the balls flap.
LAURA: That's lovely.

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.494
LIAM: I say: Look, isn't that beautiful?

01:11:14.494 --> 01:11:18.076
Wildlife is so beautiful.

01:11:18.076 --> 01:11:21.025
Then also little blue-skinned fairies

01:11:21.025 --> 01:11:24.125
Then also little blue-skinned fairies

01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:25.634
with tiny little horns.

01:11:25.634 --> 01:11:27.694
All those things go (blowing)

01:11:27.694 --> 01:11:29.924
when people walk through the gate.

01:11:29.924 --> 01:11:31.547
This will be here for the week.

01:11:31.547 --> 01:11:32.894
LAURA: (gasps)

01:11:32.894 --> 01:11:34.834
LIAM: This is just a test run.

01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:37.264
This will stay, but if you want something like this

01:11:37.264 --> 01:11:41.604
at the top of the volcano or where the boats will land.

01:11:41.604 --> 01:11:43.446
I'm not a party planner.

01:11:43.446 --> 01:11:44.882
LAURA: You aren't a party planner?

01:11:44.882 --> 01:11:46.717
Caleb, you should really be one.

01:11:46.717 --> 01:11:48.467
This is amazing.

01:11:48.467 --> 01:11:51.924
You should think about this as a new profession.

01:11:51.924 --> 01:11:53.733
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: (gasps)

01:11:53.733 --> 01:11:57.614
MATT: Other members of the
village of Vo, seeing this, emerge,

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.854
start gathering going, "Whoa!"

01:11:59.854 --> 01:12:02.094
You can immediately see some of the kids, including Treece,

01:12:02.094 --> 01:12:03.534
start running through it back and forth,

01:12:03.534 --> 01:12:05.094
back and forth, back and forth just laughing.

01:12:05.094 --> 01:12:07.010
It's like (blowing).

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:10.007
MARISHA: Get it, Treece.
MATT: Yep, they're just going.

01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:11.914
They're enthralled by it.

01:12:11.914 --> 01:12:13.414
The kids are going to wear it out

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.254
at least for the people who live here.

01:12:16.254 --> 01:12:17.844
LAURA: This is really great.

01:12:17.844 --> 01:12:19.334
Thank you, thank you.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.924
LAURA: Oh my gosh.
MATT: Okay.

01:12:21.924 --> 01:12:24.304
LAURA: This is better than anything else
I could have thought of.

01:12:24.304 --> 01:12:27.064
This is enough. (laughs)

01:12:27.064 --> 01:12:28.027
TRAVIS: 30 feet?
LAURA: Great.

01:12:28.027 --> 01:12:29.060
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.274
The first day comes to a close.

01:12:30.274 --> 01:12:33.004
LAURA: Oh wait, we also have to hide all the dicks.

01:12:33.004 --> 01:12:34.354
We should really do that early

01:12:34.354 --> 01:12:35.795
before any more people get here

01:12:35.795 --> 01:12:37.534
because I don't want them seeing where we hide them.

01:12:37.534 --> 01:12:38.367
MATT: That's true, okay.

01:12:38.367 --> 01:12:40.214
MARISHA: How difficult do you want them to be hidden?

01:12:40.214 --> 01:12:41.464
Do you want this hard mode?

01:12:41.464 --> 01:12:44.154
Should I start climbing trees (chuckling)?

01:12:44.154 --> 01:12:45.714
LAURA: Yes.
MARISHA: Okay!

01:12:45.714 --> 01:12:47.334
LAURA: We want them to be top to bottom.

01:12:47.334 --> 01:12:50.384
Some more obvious than others.

01:12:50.384 --> 01:12:51.217
MARISHA: Okay.

01:12:51.217 --> 01:12:52.531
TRAVIS: Are we burying dicks?

01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:55.982
LAURA: Um, I want them all to be visible.

01:12:55.982 --> 01:12:57.598
I don't think they should be buried.

01:12:57.598 --> 01:12:58.854
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:12:58.854 --> 01:12:59.687
LAURA: But yeah.

01:13:00.824 --> 01:13:02.714
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Yeah, camouflage them.

01:13:02.714 --> 01:13:06.324
It's the best Easter egg hunt you could ever imagine.

01:13:06.324 --> 01:13:08.364
MARISHA: I'll be on dick-hiding duty.

01:13:08.364 --> 01:13:09.674
MATT: Okay.

01:13:09.674 --> 01:13:12.164
LAURA: We should divide and conquer because there's a lot.

01:13:12.164 --> 01:13:13.214
There's like 200 dicks.

01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:15.332
That's a lot.
MARISHA: That's a lot of dicks.

01:13:15.332 --> 01:13:18.752
MATT: Who all are hiding dicks?

01:13:18.752 --> 01:13:21.533
LAURA: All of us should hide dicks.

01:13:21.533 --> 01:13:23.344
LIAM: Do you have all the dicks you need?

01:13:23.344 --> 01:13:26.195
LAURA: Yeah, we made them all on the boat.

01:13:26.195 --> 01:13:27.153
LIAM: Okay.

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:28.602
LAURA: We made so many dicks.

01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:30.294
TALIESIN: I may start plotting the easiest way

01:13:30.294 --> 01:13:31.612
to the top of the volcano.

01:13:31.612 --> 01:13:35.787
I've also got to Find the Path,

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.874
so I can start figuring out--

01:13:37.874 --> 01:13:41.874
MATT: Oh yeah, you can find the most direct and safest path.

01:13:41.874 --> 01:13:43.274
SAM: Do you need a group to go with you

01:13:43.274 --> 01:13:45.776
to widen the trail, or anything?

01:13:45.776 --> 01:13:46.742
ASHLEY: Clear the path?

01:13:46.742 --> 01:13:49.224
TALIESIN: Once you're all done hiding the dicks,

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.632
we'll make a--

01:13:50.632 --> 01:13:52.784
TRAVIS: It's like 35 per.
MATT: If I could have everybody roll

01:13:52.784 --> 01:13:54.294
an investigation check for me.

01:13:54.294 --> 01:13:55.227
SAM: For hiding?

01:13:55.227 --> 01:13:56.824
MATT: For finding the best locations

01:13:56.824 --> 01:14:00.651
that you think would be optimal for hiding the dicks.

01:14:00.651 --> 01:14:01.484
TRAVIS: This is the first roll of the day

01:14:01.484 --> 01:14:03.826
and it's to hide dicks.
LIAM: That dick roll is cocked.

01:14:04.734 --> 01:14:06.594
MATT: I love role playing games.

01:14:06.594 --> 01:14:08.865
TRAVIS: 23. Hide those dicks.

01:14:08.865 --> 01:14:11.500
LAURA: Five. Hide those dicks.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.845
LIAM: 19 dicks.

01:14:12.845 --> 01:14:15.284
SAM: 27 penises.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.117
ASHLEY: 12.

01:14:17.774 --> 01:14:18.854
TRAVIS: No name?

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:19.942
TALIESIN: I'm not in this.

01:14:19.942 --> 01:14:21.509
MARISHA: Oh, uh.

01:14:21.509 --> 01:14:24.759
15 cocks.

01:14:24.759 --> 01:14:27.670
(laughter)

01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:32.043
TALIESIN: ♪ Five gold rings ♪

01:14:32.043 --> 01:14:33.092
MARISHA: 15 cocks.

01:14:33.092 --> 01:14:34.974
MATT: There you go.
ASHLEY: Oh I got it.

01:14:34.974 --> 01:14:37.371
Sorry, I didn't know we were naming them.
SAM: It was 21 Pilots' first name.

01:14:38.329 --> 01:14:40.423
TRAVIS: Yasha needs a chance.

01:14:40.423 --> 01:14:42.508
ASHLEY: 12 peens.

01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:43.774
MATT: There we go. Okay.

01:14:43.774 --> 01:14:45.234
The circle is complete.
LIAM: ♪ Four clapping balls ♪

01:14:45.234 --> 01:14:46.885
♪ Three small peens ♪

01:14:46.885 --> 01:14:48.904
♪ Two little men ♪

01:14:48.904 --> 01:14:50.374
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Pee pees.

01:14:50.374 --> 01:14:52.054
MATT: Overall, you guys do a pretty decent job.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.194
You're pretty confident that you've hidden

01:14:54.194 --> 01:14:56.964
the majority of them in places that are attainable,

01:14:56.964 --> 01:14:58.984
but challenging enough to those that find them

01:14:58.984 --> 01:15:01.743
will take pride in what they've discovered.

01:15:01.743 --> 01:15:03.176
LAURA: (laughs)

01:15:03.176 --> 01:15:04.334
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:15:04.334 --> 01:15:06.174
LAURA: Every last dick doesn't have to be found,

01:15:06.174 --> 01:15:09.974
but everybody at the festival has to find one.

01:15:09.974 --> 01:15:12.394
SAM: Yeah, no.
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait.

01:15:12.394 --> 01:15:15.524
Should we make one really special one

01:15:15.524 --> 01:15:19.124
that if somebody finds that one, they get a crazy prize?

01:15:19.124 --> 01:15:22.409
LIAM: Yeah, the golden dick-it.
ASHLEY: The one hidden under the chair

01:15:22.409 --> 01:15:23.242
type of a thing.

01:15:23.242 --> 01:15:25.900
MARISHA: The golden dick-it.
SAM: ♪ I've got the golden dick-it ♪

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:29.324
♪ I've got the golden dick-it ♪

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:30.484
LAURA: Yeah, we totally should.

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:31.317
ASHLEY: I don't know what the prize is,

01:15:31.317 --> 01:15:35.314
but maybe we paint a gold dick.

01:15:35.314 --> 01:15:37.354
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have gold dust.

01:15:37.354 --> 01:15:39.344
SAM: Sure, I have some.

01:15:39.344 --> 01:15:42.184
I gave it away but then, I think I got it back.

01:15:42.184 --> 01:15:43.704
MATT: You did get it back.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:43.704 --> 01:15:45.720
Let's paint one of the dicks with gold dust.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.126
SAM: I'll take care of that.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:49.854
ASHLEY: We can figure out what the prize will be later.

01:15:49.854 --> 01:15:51.754
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

01:15:51.754 --> 01:15:55.439
SAM: Finding it is a prize in and of itself.

01:15:55.439 --> 01:15:58.644
LIAM: Do we want a literal gold dick?

01:15:58.644 --> 01:16:00.124
LAURA: Like, a dick made of gold?

01:16:00.124 --> 01:16:03.294
LIAM: Yeah, I could transmute some of our coin to--

01:16:03.294 --> 01:16:05.257
LAURA: I don't want to waste our actual coin.

01:16:06.684 --> 01:16:08.004
LIAM: You're right, too much dicks.

01:16:08.004 --> 01:16:10.709
I have a hard time knowing when it's the right amount

01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:13.291
of dick humor and when it's over the line.

01:16:13.291 --> 01:16:16.754
TRAVIS: Better to have too much than ask for more. Really.

01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:18.855
It's not a bad thing.

01:16:18.855 --> 01:16:23.774
LAURA: If you want to transmute
some gold into a dick for me,

01:16:23.774 --> 01:16:25.004
I will keep that dick.

01:16:25.004 --> 01:16:27.774
But I don't want to let somebody else have a golden dick.

01:16:27.774 --> 01:16:28.607
You know what I mean?

01:16:28.607 --> 01:16:29.711
LIAM: We'll think about that.

01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:31.494
LAURA: What about if you transmute it into a gold dick

01:16:31.494 --> 01:16:34.524
and then you hide it and then I'll have to search for it.

01:16:34.524 --> 01:16:35.808
And if I find it--

01:16:35.808 --> 01:16:37.624
SAM: You don't want to waste your time searching.

01:16:37.624 --> 01:16:39.457
We can just make you one some other time.

01:16:39.457 --> 01:16:40.964
(laughter)

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.514
What, are you going to spend two days looking for this?

01:16:43.514 --> 01:16:46.284
You're supposed to be running a festival here.

01:16:46.284 --> 01:16:48.754
Don't get distracted!

01:16:48.754 --> 01:16:51.547
LIAM: Caleb totally just blue screened.

01:16:51.547 --> 01:16:54.464
(laughter)

01:16:56.054 --> 01:16:57.964
SAM: All right, we're good, we got a plan.

01:16:57.964 --> 01:16:58.924
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

01:16:58.924 --> 01:16:59.757
As you guys are hiding those,

01:16:59.757 --> 01:17:01.454
Caduceus, using Find the Path,

01:17:01.454 --> 01:17:03.854
it takes you the better part of a day, but you manage to

01:17:03.854 --> 01:17:06.302
make your way from the northern side of the village of Vo,

01:17:06.302 --> 01:17:09.569
through this little valley area between

01:17:09.569 --> 01:17:12.344
two of the larger hills that
leads to the base of the volcano.

01:17:12.344 --> 01:17:14.944
Far from the entrances to it, but it does bring you

01:17:14.944 --> 01:17:19.134
to a bit of a rocky path that you see could be walked.

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:21.484
It's still not safe.

01:17:21.484 --> 01:17:24.974
There is no safe passage to the top of the volcano,

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:28.064
but it is the best route

01:17:28.064 --> 01:17:30.711
to try and take a hundred people or so.

01:17:30.711 --> 01:17:32.484
There'll have to be precautions.

01:17:32.484 --> 01:17:35.084
TALIESIN: Tomorrow, I'll do another round with some buddies

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:36.874
and a clearing party and use some Stone Shape

01:17:36.874 --> 01:17:39.404
and start to reinforce it.

01:17:39.404 --> 01:17:42.232
Leave some colored stones.

01:17:42.232 --> 01:17:44.264
MATT: Okay, cool.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:17:44.264 --> 01:17:47.114
MATT: First day's work goes through well.

01:17:47.114 --> 01:17:49.174
Five more days 'til Traveler Con.

01:17:49.174 --> 01:17:52.964
As you guys bed down for the evening, set yourselves

01:17:52.964 --> 01:17:56.464
for a night's rest to prepare for the next coming day,

01:17:56.464 --> 01:18:00.801
we'll say, Caduceus, as your evening winds down

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:04.559
and you find a moment to focus on your meditation,

01:18:06.064 --> 01:18:08.584
you're having a hard time focusing.

01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:12.234
Your mind pushes to the point of clarity

01:18:12.234 --> 01:18:15.784
and emptiness that you're used to reaching for.

01:18:15.784 --> 01:18:17.844
But at that familiar, welcoming precipice,

01:18:17.844 --> 01:18:19.204
your thoughts wander back

01:18:19.204 --> 01:18:22.974
to the visions you saw in Vokodo's final moments.

01:18:22.974 --> 01:18:25.846
You live for the natural order of life.

01:18:25.846 --> 01:18:28.364
Not just your philosophy, not just your family's legacy,

01:18:28.364 --> 01:18:31.544
but what you believe to be the deepest purpose of your soul

01:18:31.544 --> 01:18:34.154
is tied to maintaining and helping

01:18:34.154 --> 01:18:38.564
the natural order of the world continue and flourish.

01:18:38.564 --> 01:18:40.994
While many things can dampen or oppose

01:18:40.994 --> 01:18:42.844
the Wild Mother's wishes, she understands

01:18:42.844 --> 01:18:45.044
that moral hubris is part of this balance.

01:18:45.044 --> 01:18:47.957
That where things are built and things then crumble.

01:18:50.204 --> 01:18:53.314
What you saw in these visions, though,

01:18:53.314 --> 01:18:56.064
it haunts you in these quiet moments.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:58.184
You, above all else, feel and understand things

01:18:58.184 --> 01:19:01.484
with an instinctual insight few others can really achieve.

01:19:01.484 --> 01:19:05.209
What you saw was perversion of all that you hold sacred.

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:08.704
What you saw was perversion of all that you hold sacred.

01:19:08.704 --> 01:19:10.454
You struggle to make sense of the vision,

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:13.864
of what you felt as it carved through your mind.

01:19:13.864 --> 01:19:18.517
But you are only left with a primal coldness and fear.

01:19:20.014 --> 01:19:21.834
You touched something truly alien

01:19:21.834 --> 01:19:24.244
and entirely removed from the cycle of nature.

01:19:24.244 --> 01:19:27.954
Both in Exandria and the natural order of the cosmic weave.

01:19:27.954 --> 01:19:30.434
You, perhaps, know more than any of your comrades

01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:34.150
the terror that drove a creature like Vokodo to desperation.

01:19:37.144 --> 01:19:38.114
When you finally come to a point

01:19:38.114 --> 01:19:42.844
where you get yourself to the edge of meditative rest,

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:45.264
the rest of your friends have gone to sleep

01:19:45.264 --> 01:19:47.287
and you eventually feel you should follow suit.

01:19:56.563 --> 01:19:58.568
The morning of day two come to.

01:19:58.568 --> 01:20:00.484
For the second day of preparation.

01:20:00.484 --> 01:20:02.584
Five days to go. What would you guys like to do?

01:20:03.725 --> 01:20:07.760
SAM: Do we want to check in with our crew?

01:20:09.264 --> 01:20:11.554
LAURA: Oh yeah.
SAM: At some point this week.

01:20:11.554 --> 01:20:15.084
Just to see if they've found the ships and how's it going?

01:20:15.084 --> 01:20:16.584
LAURA: Sure. Do you want me to send a message?

01:20:16.584 --> 01:20:17.974
SAM: Can you?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:17.974 --> 01:20:20.304
I'll send a message to Orly.

01:20:20.304 --> 01:20:21.974
Hey, Orly.

01:20:21.974 --> 01:20:24.034
Did you find the ships?

01:20:24.034 --> 01:20:25.884
Did you figure out how to get it out?

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:29.144
Are you guys still alive?

01:20:29.144 --> 01:20:31.875
MARISHA: Is Marius dead?
LAURA: Is Marius dead?

01:20:33.554 --> 01:20:36.234
Uh, okay, let me know.

01:20:37.451 --> 01:20:38.554
(laughter)

01:20:38.554 --> 01:20:41.074
TRAVIS: There was an uh in there that was a half-committal.

01:20:41.074 --> 01:20:42.734
MATT: That's fine.

01:20:42.734 --> 01:20:44.984
Orly responds really quickly.

01:20:44.984 --> 01:20:47.903
"You bet we found 'em."

01:20:47.903 --> 01:20:50.537
(laughter)

01:20:50.537 --> 01:20:55.404
"M-M-Marius: still alive,

01:20:55.404 --> 01:20:57.637
"still pointless."

01:20:57.637 --> 01:20:59.944
(laughter)

01:20:59.944 --> 01:21:02.795
MARISHA: Orly with the shade.

01:21:02.795 --> 01:21:04.994
LIAM: So pithy.

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:06.444
MATT: "Ships, though,

01:21:07.614 --> 01:21:11.314
"ain't too confident, yet,

01:21:11.314 --> 01:21:14.297
"about exiting."

01:21:15.384 --> 01:21:16.704
That's where it ends.

01:21:16.704 --> 01:21:19.364
LAURA: Man, they haven't figured out
how to get the ships out,

01:21:19.364 --> 01:21:20.714
so they don't break up.

01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:21.547
SAM: They're smart, though.

01:21:21.547 --> 01:21:24.182
They'll keep working on it.

01:21:24.182 --> 01:21:26.924
LAURA: (sighing) Yeah.

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:29.364
MATT: All right, any endeavors for the second day

01:21:29.364 --> 01:21:31.234
you wish to charge through?

01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:33.964
TALIESIN: I'd like to take a group and start clearing out

01:21:33.964 --> 01:21:36.404
the path and marking it as best I can.

01:21:36.404 --> 01:21:38.544
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a survival check for me,

01:21:38.544 --> 01:21:39.995
if you don't mind.

01:21:43.142 --> 01:21:44.043
TALIESIN: 10.

01:21:44.043 --> 01:21:45.694
MATT: 10, okay.

01:21:45.694 --> 01:21:47.554
It takes the better part of the day

01:21:47.554 --> 01:21:50.902
and you do get a point of exhaustion.

01:21:53.234 --> 01:21:55.984
But you do, still using your Find the Path spell

01:21:55.984 --> 01:21:57.734
and now guiding a number of volunteers

01:21:57.734 --> 01:22:01.054
from the village of Vo, you do clear out a good section

01:22:01.054 --> 01:22:04.344
of the jungle heading towards the base of this volcano.

01:22:04.344 --> 01:22:07.164
The volcano ascension and clearing a path there

01:22:07.164 --> 01:22:08.834
with more of the stones I think you were referring to would

01:22:08.834 --> 01:22:12.450
probably take the better part of the next few days to do so,

01:22:12.450 --> 01:22:14.408
especially with you leading it.

01:22:14.408 --> 01:22:16.214
TALIESIN: If there's time, I'd like to take a moment

01:22:16.214 --> 01:22:17.666
at the top of the volcano.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.408
Do I make it there?

01:22:20.408 --> 01:22:24.194
Or it could be the highest point that I get to on day two.

01:22:24.194 --> 01:22:26.744
MATT: Day two, you only get part way up.

01:22:26.744 --> 01:22:28.484
Maybe close to half way

01:22:28.484 --> 01:22:30.454
because you're slowly moving through with other people

01:22:30.454 --> 01:22:32.917
and shaping the path as you go.

01:22:33.764 --> 01:22:35.597
In order to get there, you'd probably
have to have somebody take you.

01:22:36.549 --> 01:22:39.134
TALIESIN: I'll just go as far as I'm going to go.

01:22:39.134 --> 01:22:41.494
I'm going to sit and I'm going to use Commune.

01:22:41.494 --> 01:22:44.860
MATT: Okay, all right.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:48.904
As the rest of the troop leaves you to do your communion,

01:22:48.904 --> 01:22:51.534
not fully understanding, but giving the privacy,

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:53.994
they step a little ways down and begin

01:22:53.994 --> 01:22:55.744
taking a rest themselves to snack

01:22:55.744 --> 01:22:57.854
on whatever provisions they brought with them.

01:22:57.854 --> 01:22:59.524
As you quietly close your eyes and sit there

01:22:59.524 --> 01:23:02.384
on the edge of the mountain, the once dark smoke,

01:23:02.384 --> 01:23:07.184
now a light white and much less violent

01:23:07.184 --> 01:23:09.674
than it was when you arrived on the island is welcome.

01:23:09.674 --> 01:23:12.684
But you can still smell the faint elements

01:23:12.684 --> 01:23:16.214
of sulfurous scent that the wind catches to you.

01:23:16.214 --> 01:23:19.434
As you take a deep breath and inhale those

01:23:19.434 --> 01:23:23.664
effervescent vapors and you exhale, you can feel the breath

01:23:23.664 --> 01:23:28.034
from your nose take color in your eyelids in the dark space.

01:23:28.034 --> 01:23:30.764
As that color begins to take shape around you,

01:23:30.764 --> 01:23:34.764
it becomes a faint, warm, light green.

01:23:34.764 --> 01:23:38.014
As it does, you can see leaves sprout and flowers sprout.

01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:41.054
There, in the space of your mind,

01:23:41.054 --> 01:23:42.734
you begin to feel that warm breeze once more

01:23:42.734 --> 01:23:44.734
and her presence is there to answer you.

01:23:50.494 --> 01:23:52.252
TALIESIN: I've had a terrible vision.

01:23:53.454 --> 01:23:57.360
Something beyond me.

01:23:59.694 --> 01:24:00.994
Do you know it?

01:24:03.424 --> 01:24:04.490
MATT: "No."

01:24:09.314 --> 01:24:10.937
TALIESIN: Can you sense it at all?

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:17.574
MATT: Just the slight cold change in the wind

01:24:17.574 --> 01:24:21.124
that gave you a negative response.

01:24:21.124 --> 01:24:23.734
Initially, the wind blows back in the other direction,

01:24:23.734 --> 01:24:26.579
also cold.

01:24:28.432 --> 01:24:29.480
LIAM: That's from out there.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:31.330
TALIESIN: Is it coming for us?

01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:32.483
LIAM: Way out there.

01:24:32.483 --> 01:24:34.564
MARISHA: Cosmic shit.

01:24:34.564 --> 01:24:36.064
MATT: The wind stays stagnant.

01:24:36.064 --> 01:24:38.722
No temperature, warm or cold,

01:24:38.722 --> 01:24:41.572
just uncertain.

01:24:43.714 --> 01:24:44.904
LAURA: (whispered) Beyond the gods.

01:24:44.904 --> 01:24:49.641
TALIESIN: All right, walk back down the hill.

01:24:49.641 --> 01:24:50.474
MATT: Okay.

01:24:56.604 --> 01:24:59.121
Okay, anybody else have business for the day?

01:24:59.121 --> 01:25:01.804
The dicks are hidden, the arch is made,

01:25:01.804 --> 01:25:02.917
the stage is built.

01:25:03.971 --> 01:25:06.194
LAURA: I'm thinking where the boats

01:25:06.194 --> 01:25:08.834
are going to dock, down at the beach.

01:25:08.834 --> 01:25:13.264
Maybe at the entrance, when you first walk into the jungle,

01:25:13.264 --> 01:25:16.884
you can make, all of a sudden, it look like the Traveler

01:25:16.884 --> 01:25:20.562
appears in front of them and beckons them with a finger.

01:25:21.474 --> 01:25:23.201
Let them know what path to take.

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:25.334
LIAM: And passes underneath him, or through him,

01:25:25.334 --> 01:25:27.404
or he just appears and then vanishes?

01:25:27.404 --> 01:25:30.254
LAURA: He'll beckon and then,
as they get close, he'll go (blows).

01:25:30.254 --> 01:25:31.374
He poofs away.

01:25:31.374 --> 01:25:33.384
LIAM: And larger than life, yeah?

01:25:33.384 --> 01:25:36.064
LAURA: Yeah, super sparkly.
LIAM: Okay.

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:38.670
LAURA: Maybe a little taller than normal
just to make him seem--

01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:41.094
SAM: Can you have two programed illusions going?

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:43.624
LIAM: Yeah, they are indefinite.

01:25:43.624 --> 01:25:45.537
SAM: Wow, cool.
TRAVIS: Fucking A.

01:25:45.537 --> 01:25:47.437
ASHLEY: That's so cool.
LAURA: It's really cool.

01:25:48.574 --> 01:25:50.564
LIAM: I would have you show me

01:25:50.564 --> 01:25:52.036
where on the beach you wanted it precisely.

01:25:52.036 --> 01:25:53.764
So we take a walk to wherever that point is

01:25:53.764 --> 01:25:57.669
and I can scooch him around a little bit

01:25:57.669 --> 01:26:01.148
and grow him up or shrink him down and get the tone right.

01:26:01.148 --> 01:26:02.734
LAURA: Yeah, he's looking quite lovely.

01:26:02.734 --> 01:26:04.184
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:26:04.184 --> 01:26:07.054
Can you make a little fairy me, again,

01:26:07.054 --> 01:26:09.144
and make me buzzing around him?

01:26:09.144 --> 01:26:10.284
LIAM: Yeah, like Jiminy Cricket,

01:26:10.284 --> 01:26:14.706
there is a little Jester fairy going (fluttering).

01:26:14.706 --> 01:26:18.234
Then when he leaves, she's left and (fluttering) vanishes.

01:26:18.234 --> 01:26:20.469
LAURA: Make her fly down the path. You know what I mean?

01:26:20.469 --> 01:26:21.684
LIAM: Perfect, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:21.684 --> 01:26:23.150
LIAM: Like a GPS.

01:26:24.524 --> 01:26:25.824
Okay.

01:26:25.824 --> 01:26:28.344
MATT: All right, piece by piece, Caleb is helping Jester

01:26:28.344 --> 01:26:31.259
turn this into a Disney resort.

01:26:31.259 --> 01:26:34.564
(laughter)

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:37.534
SAM: Food, lodging, arts and crafts.

01:26:37.534 --> 01:26:38.584
Who's on what?

01:26:38.584 --> 01:26:40.414
Come on, come on, help me out here.

01:26:40.414 --> 01:26:44.758
MARISHA: I'm going to start
building out the dance/fight ring.

01:26:44.758 --> 01:26:46.484
SAM: Okay, cool!

01:26:46.484 --> 01:26:49.504
MARISHA: I'm going to start gathering some boulders,

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:53.634
building it out, making a fight ring.

01:26:53.634 --> 01:26:58.204
I want to make it a one little dance circle, and then

01:26:58.204 --> 01:27:00.014
another dance circle, and then

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:02.805
a longer dance circle

01:27:02.805 --> 01:27:05.724
attached to the two other ones.

01:27:05.724 --> 01:27:08.054
SAM: A Venn diagram dance party?

01:27:08.054 --> 01:27:10.164
MARISHA: Absolutely.
SAM: Okay.

01:27:10.164 --> 01:27:12.442
MATT: Where the ones where they all meet
are the craziest dancers.

01:27:12.442 --> 01:27:14.175
MARISHA: (laughing) Yes.
TRAVIS: That's the mosh.

01:27:14.175 --> 01:27:15.594
MATT: Yeah.

01:27:15.594 --> 01:27:18.483
LIAM: I'm having visions of Beau doing capoeira.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:19.947
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:27:19.947 --> 01:27:21.174
MATT: All righty.

01:27:21.174 --> 01:27:25.684
ASHLEY: I will take care of the arts and crafts area.

01:27:27.084 --> 01:27:31.584
I'm going to make a nice circle and an archway

01:27:31.584 --> 01:27:35.225
into the circle made of flowers,

01:27:35.225 --> 01:27:37.004
and then also the circle.

01:27:37.004 --> 01:27:39.234
Then, put all the wood in the middle

01:27:39.234 --> 01:27:42.120
for whittling the dicks.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.112
LAURA: That's great.

01:27:43.112 --> 01:27:46.484
ASHLEY: Yeah, just vibrant and beautiful.

01:27:46.484 --> 01:27:47.884
MATT: A number of villagers come and help you

01:27:47.884 --> 01:27:50.114
both gather supplies and help in the whittling process.

01:27:50.114 --> 01:27:51.304
But they're all following your lead

01:27:51.304 --> 01:27:54.013
as you're the appointed arts and crafts leader of today.

01:27:54.013 --> 01:27:54.846
ASHLEY: Great.

01:27:56.124 --> 01:27:59.524
LAURA: Also, you know what else we need to actually have?

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:02.134
Our drums, so that once everybody makes their drumstick,

01:28:02.134 --> 01:28:04.250
then they have something to beat it on.

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:06.315
We need to makes some drums.

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:07.148
SAM: All right, then.

01:28:07.148 --> 01:28:09.279
LAURA: Anybody know how to make drums?

01:28:09.279 --> 01:28:11.764
SAM: Sure, yep, I'll take care of that,

01:28:11.764 --> 01:28:13.344
if that's something you need.

01:28:13.344 --> 01:28:14.177
Sure.

01:28:15.564 --> 01:28:19.944
MATT: Berex, actually, the dwarf
who you'd stayed in the first abode, goes,

01:28:19.944 --> 01:28:22.844
"I can actually help make drums.

01:28:22.844 --> 01:28:24.684
"They're rather rudimentary, but--"

01:28:24.684 --> 01:28:26.205
LAURA: That's great.
MATT: "We've got some hides.

01:28:26.205 --> 01:28:27.038
"I can do that."
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:27.038 --> 01:28:28.264
That's wonderful.

01:28:28.264 --> 01:28:29.414
MATT: "How many do you need?"

01:28:30.254 --> 01:28:31.384
LAURA: It depends on the size.

01:28:31.384 --> 01:28:33.674
Multiple people can beat on one.

01:28:33.674 --> 01:28:34.894
SAM: We could make a few big ones.

01:28:34.894 --> 01:28:35.727
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:37.041
MATT: "All right, we could probably that.

01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:38.351
"It'd take a couple days.

01:28:38.351 --> 01:28:40.354
"All right, I'll get some folks together."

01:28:40.354 --> 01:28:43.234
SAM: That's great.
LAURA: It's all coming together.

01:28:43.234 --> 01:28:44.994
TRAVIS: I'll checking lodging.

01:28:44.994 --> 01:28:46.594
I'll see if there are any repairs

01:28:46.594 --> 01:28:49.374
that need to be done to any of the tree houses.

01:28:49.374 --> 01:28:52.554
LAURA: Beautification, yeah.
SAM: Extra cots, maybe?

01:28:52.554 --> 01:28:54.834
You know what I really like when I go stay at a place?

01:28:54.834 --> 01:28:57.214
If they have a little kit of stuff, like,

01:28:57.214 --> 01:29:00.314
an extra toothbrush, in case you didn't bring one.

01:29:00.314 --> 01:29:04.591
TRAVIS: A towel folded into a swan
and maybe some flower petals.

01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:05.424
SAM: I love that.

01:29:05.424 --> 01:29:09.404
ASHLEY: I could help with bed flower arrangements.

01:29:09.404 --> 01:29:10.857
That would look nice.

01:29:12.114 --> 01:29:12.947
MATT: Okay.

01:29:14.164 --> 01:29:17.764
The second batch of Vo ex-pats make their exit.

01:29:17.764 --> 01:29:20.604
The second batch of Vo ex-pats make their exit.

01:29:20.604 --> 01:29:22.540
Onwards this way, to Marquet.

01:29:24.194 --> 01:29:25.337
Do you give out the coin pouches?

01:29:25.337 --> 01:29:26.170
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

01:29:26.170 --> 01:29:28.064
MATT: Imagine again, as the doorway opens,

01:29:28.064 --> 01:29:32.234
you can see a cluster of tropical trees,

01:29:32.234 --> 01:29:37.114
not far from a somewhat green

01:29:37.114 --> 01:29:41.064
and lush hillside that leads to a smaller village with

01:29:41.064 --> 01:29:44.637
these tall, white, pearl-like towers and an exterior wall.

01:29:45.614 --> 01:29:46.864
It's beautiful.

01:29:46.864 --> 01:29:48.094
Some elements of it seem tropical,

01:29:48.094 --> 01:29:51.974
but there's no sign of an ocean or a coastline.

01:29:51.974 --> 01:29:54.815
Unfamiliar with the location, but as people pass through

01:29:54.815 --> 01:29:57.882
(whooshing) it closes and the second batch have left.

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.189
Second day is complete.

01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:04.074
Anything else?
TRAVIS: Tal'Dorei, Xhorhas, and Zadash.

01:30:04.074 --> 01:30:05.654
MATT: Correct.

01:30:05.654 --> 01:30:08.624
LAURA: Is the Traveler popping in and out

01:30:08.624 --> 01:30:10.612
or have I seen him at all since?

01:30:10.612 --> 01:30:12.224
MATT: Not in two days.
LAURA: Okay.

01:30:12.224 --> 01:30:13.641
MATT: Not yet.
LAURA: Okay.

01:30:14.684 --> 01:30:16.194
MATT: Unless there's anything else to be done,

01:30:16.194 --> 01:30:18.111
we come to the third day.

01:30:18.964 --> 01:30:20.544
All right.

01:30:20.544 --> 01:30:21.894
Third day comes.

01:30:21.894 --> 01:30:24.604
The third group gets ready to leave.

01:30:24.604 --> 01:30:26.774
This one is to Zadash

01:30:26.774 --> 01:30:30.794
and has probably the largest crew of people.

01:30:30.794 --> 01:30:32.354
Some that seem to have missed the first day

01:30:32.354 --> 01:30:33.844
and actually meant to go to Menagerie Coast

01:30:33.844 --> 01:30:35.624
and either overslept or were still figuring out

01:30:35.624 --> 01:30:37.406
if they wanted to stay or go and now decided to leave

01:30:37.406 --> 01:30:38.794
and they're like, "Ah, it's close enough."

01:30:38.794 --> 01:30:43.294
And other folks who are either Empire or Empire-adjacent

01:30:43.294 --> 01:30:45.904
returning to what their life was previously.

01:30:45.904 --> 01:30:47.784
All gather up towards the tree.

01:30:47.784 --> 01:30:49.794
You divvy out the pouches.

01:30:49.794 --> 01:30:52.824
As it opens up, you see a familiar sight.

01:30:52.824 --> 01:30:54.244
It's the edge of a treeline.

01:30:54.244 --> 01:30:56.284
Just beyond the cluster of trees ahead,

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:59.324
you can see the exterior perimeter walls of Zadash.

01:30:59.324 --> 01:31:03.034
This is probably from the northern, northern-western side.

01:31:03.034 --> 01:31:06.544
You see the triangular-shaped city laid out and

01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:11.514
the various spires breaking up towards the distant skyline.

01:31:11.514 --> 01:31:13.074
TRAVIS: We've snuck through that bitch so many times.

01:31:13.074 --> 01:31:14.677
Have a good story ready.

01:31:15.714 --> 01:31:17.129
SAM: Look for Dolan!

01:31:19.784 --> 01:31:22.184
MATT: All right, anything else on the third day to be done?

01:31:24.524 --> 01:31:26.104
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: Oh boy.

01:31:26.104 --> 01:31:28.134
MARISHA: What are we missing off of our list?

01:31:28.134 --> 01:31:29.684
SAM: We might need some food,

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:32.497
so we were thinking of hunting a T-Rex.

01:31:32.497 --> 01:31:34.864
MARISHA: That's right.
SAM: We could do that.

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:38.222
Or if there's more fight pit stuff that you want to do.

01:31:38.222 --> 01:31:41.224
TALIESIN: Talk to the locals about
what actually is good to eat.

01:31:41.224 --> 01:31:43.164
LAURA: Yeah, let's ask if we need to hunt anything.

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:46.794
SAM: I'll go talk to Anola about the plan for food.

01:31:46.794 --> 01:31:50.027
MATT: Okay. Anola goes, "Well,

01:31:50.027 --> 01:31:54.594
"we had some decent stores before we lost everyone, so.

01:31:56.234 --> 01:31:59.854
"We have enough for us, but with everyone who's coming,

01:31:59.854 --> 01:32:01.597
"hunting would be important.

01:32:02.444 --> 01:32:07.444
"Unfortunately, our lead hunters left a couple of days ago.

01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:12.324
"So all we have at this point now are Pono, or,

01:32:12.324 --> 01:32:17.324
"I'm sorry, Kieren and Ashelyn."

01:32:17.494 --> 01:32:20.976
MARISHA: Oh, the bears.
SAM: The bear people.

01:32:20.976 --> 01:32:23.204
TRAVIS: Kieren is Pono, or was Pono.

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:25.304
MATT: Correct.
SAM: Kieren is very dry.

01:32:26.638 --> 01:32:28.414
So we'll--

01:32:28.414 --> 01:32:29.674
we'll ask them.

01:32:29.674 --> 01:32:33.124
I'll go talk to them or rustle them up, I suppose.

01:32:33.124 --> 01:32:35.194
MATT: All right, you're assembling a hunting party.

01:32:35.194 --> 01:32:36.364
SAM: That's right.
MATT: All right.

01:32:36.364 --> 01:32:37.964
Who's joining the hunting party?

01:32:39.644 --> 01:32:42.147
TALIESIN: Oh hell.
SAM: Literally everyone.

01:32:42.147 --> 01:32:44.493
MATT: Okay, okay, good, all right.

01:32:44.493 --> 01:32:47.164
LAURA: We'll all take a trip, try to hunt something big.

01:32:47.164 --> 01:32:48.297
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Sure.

01:32:50.304 --> 01:32:53.257
MATT: As you guys gather your supplies,

01:32:55.494 --> 01:32:58.288
we're going to go ahead and take a break.

01:32:58.288 --> 01:33:03.288
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, MARISHA, and MATT: ♪ (Jurassic Park music) ♪

01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:07.156
LAURA: We all die before, like, one day before Traveler Con

01:33:07.156 --> 01:33:10.904
because we decided to hunt a T-Rex.
TRAVIS: That's a noble cause, you guys.

01:33:10.904 --> 01:33:14.304
TALIESIN: Nothing more Traveler Con
than being eaten by a T-Rex.

01:33:14.304 --> 01:33:15.254
MATT: You're not wrong.

01:33:16.114 --> 01:33:17.384
We'll be back here shortly.

01:33:17.384 --> 01:33:18.217
We're going to take a little break

01:33:18.217 --> 01:33:21.444
and then we'll jump into the next few elements of

01:33:21.444 --> 01:33:23.754
preparation for Traveler Con, possibly hunting a T-Rex,

01:33:23.754 --> 01:33:27.567
it looks like, and see what else happens.

01:33:28.604 --> 01:33:31.089
We'll see you guys here shortly (laughing).

TALIESIN: Rooms and taverns and courts.

01:34:55.539 --> 01:34:57.629
MATT: Locations and color palettes.

01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:59.549
TALIESIN: It's gorgeous, it's epic.

01:34:59.549 --> 01:35:02.489
MARISHA: It's beyond all our expectations.

01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:04.499
ASHLEY: To see it all for the first time

01:35:04.499 --> 01:35:06.209
I went and I sat in my car

01:35:06.209 --> 01:35:07.699
and I just started crying.

01:35:07.699 --> 01:35:10.724
'Cause I was like, I can't believe this is real.

01:35:10.724 --> 01:35:14.141
(energetic upbeat music)

01:35:22.279 --> 01:35:24.719 line:20%
LIAM: The trajectory of this story over the years

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:26.749 line:20%
is constantly defined our expectations.

01:35:26.749 --> 01:35:28.239 line:20%
The size and the scale of it

01:35:28.239 --> 01:35:31.869
has felt so large and sweeping to us in our minds.

01:35:31.869 --> 01:35:34.499
And so you think, what could possibly live up to it?

01:35:34.499 --> 01:35:36.239
And the team at Titmouse,

01:35:36.239 --> 01:35:38.732
has really been answering the call.

01:35:39.879 --> 01:35:42.869 line:20%
BRANDON: Titmouse is one of the best animation studios around

01:35:42.869 --> 01:35:43.702 line:20%
period.

01:35:43.702 --> 01:35:44.809 line:20%
SAM: They check all the boxes.

01:35:44.809 --> 01:35:47.579 line:20%
They've got animation cred up the wazoo

01:35:47.579 --> 01:35:49.239 line:20%
they've worked on funny shows,

01:35:49.239 --> 01:35:50.449 line:20%
dramatic shows.

01:35:50.449 --> 01:35:51.299 line:20%
They've done it all.

01:35:51.299 --> 01:35:56.299 line:20%
MARISHA: It truly feels like a company made of nerds.

01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:58.209 line:20%
Just like our company.

01:35:58.209 --> 01:36:03.059 line:20%
We instantly felt a kinship and a shared language.

01:36:03.059 --> 01:36:05.289
It kind of lowered the barrier to entry.

01:36:05.289 --> 01:36:07.909 line:20%
ARTHUR: The people at the top who define the culture

01:36:07.909 --> 01:36:09.439 line:20%
and the attitude of the studio

01:36:09.439 --> 01:36:11.919 line:20%
are themselves huge nerds.

01:36:11.919 --> 01:36:13.349 line:20%
Super into this stuff.

01:36:13.349 --> 01:36:14.739 line:20%
And not just for me,

01:36:14.739 --> 01:36:15.969
but for them,

01:36:15.969 --> 01:36:17.489
this is kind of the dream project

01:36:17.489 --> 01:36:19.489
because we're sort of living out

01:36:19.489 --> 01:36:20.729
our dream of finally getting

01:36:20.729 --> 01:36:22.579
to create this type of property.

01:36:22.579 --> 01:36:24.089 line:20%
LAURA: They aren't wanting to take,

01:36:24.089 --> 01:36:25.159 line:20%
something that we've created

01:36:25.159 --> 01:36:26.639 line:20%
and turn it into something completely different.

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:29.309 line:20%
They wanna honor what it was that we did.

01:36:29.309 --> 01:36:31.119 line:20%
MATT: Everyone else seems genuinely as excited

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:31.952 line:20%
to be a part of this

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:33.751 line:20%
as we're excited to have it happening.

01:36:33.751 --> 01:36:36.379
(energetic upbeat music)

01:36:36.379 --> 01:36:39.439
ARTHUR: I'm proud to count myself among the Critters.

01:36:39.439 --> 01:36:42.419
I was one of the 90,000 to back this project

01:36:42.419 --> 01:36:43.329
in the first place.

01:36:43.329 --> 01:36:45.839
I had no idea I was going to be on it.

01:36:45.839 --> 01:36:47.769 line:20%
TRAVIS: I remember very distinctly

01:36:47.769 --> 01:36:50.279 line:20%
getting my eyes on some of Arthur Loftis,

01:36:50.279 --> 01:36:53.119
our directors first background pieces,

01:36:53.119 --> 01:36:54.339
and just being stunned.

01:36:54.339 --> 01:36:56.559
BRANDON: Not only is he a professional artist and designer,

01:36:56.559 --> 01:36:58.859
he's also a big Critical Role fan.

01:36:58.859 --> 01:37:00.449
So, the fact that you've got somebody

01:37:00.449 --> 01:37:01.609
who really knows the show,

01:37:01.609 --> 01:37:04.329
who's designing things even down to minute detail,

01:37:04.329 --> 01:37:05.859
like even Matt Mercer is like,

01:37:05.859 --> 01:37:06.869
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

01:37:06.869 --> 01:37:08.529
But Arthur hasn't forgotten about it.

01:37:08.529 --> 01:37:10.029
Like he has put it in the show.

01:37:10.029 --> 01:37:11.729
SAM: And that's something you just don't get

01:37:11.729 --> 01:37:13.229
in any animated series.

01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:14.609
Usually the executive producer

01:37:14.609 --> 01:37:16.289
has to explain to the art director,

01:37:16.289 --> 01:37:18.009
the feeling that he's trying to evoke

01:37:18.009 --> 01:37:19.289
or she's trying to evoke,

01:37:19.289 --> 01:37:20.949
but Arthur knows that feeling

01:37:20.949 --> 01:37:22.789
because he watched it live.

01:37:22.789 --> 01:37:25.419 line:20%
SUNG: A lot of the vision does come from Arthur,

01:37:25.419 --> 01:37:27.989 line:20%
but then where I add to it is

01:37:27.989 --> 01:37:31.789 line:20%
how to make the world seem really alive and believable.

01:37:31.789 --> 01:37:33.899
My role as supervising director

01:37:33.899 --> 01:37:36.269
is to really coordinate work with the story team.

01:37:36.269 --> 01:37:38.879
We're literally translating idea into visual

01:37:38.879 --> 01:37:40.789
and finding opportunities that really push

01:37:40.789 --> 01:37:42.919
those moments to make the world feel

01:37:42.919 --> 01:37:44.229
that much more integrated.

01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:46.729
SAM: Sung Jin works on all the episodes.

01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:49.729
And he's got the big picture, the 10,000 foot view

01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:51.269
about where the story is going

01:37:51.269 --> 01:37:52.609
over the course of the season,

01:37:52.609 --> 01:37:54.909
where the story is going over the course of the series.

01:37:54.909 --> 01:37:57.409
MARISHA: He is so dedicated to making sure that

01:37:57.409 --> 01:38:00.409
it feels right for "The Legend of Vox Machina."

01:38:00.409 --> 01:38:02.569
MATT: I have never felt more confident

01:38:02.569 --> 01:38:04.859
in letting other people handle a vision of mine

01:38:04.859 --> 01:38:08.032
than already seeing what they're doing with the whole team.

01:38:08.032 --> 01:38:08.865
(energetic upbeat music)

01:38:08.865 --> 01:38:10.939
SAM: We're getting to revisit all these great locations

01:38:10.939 --> 01:38:13.859
that we explored in the original Vox Machina campaign

01:38:13.859 --> 01:38:15.109
that we played through live.

01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:17.349
Locations like Emon.

01:38:17.349 --> 01:38:20.529 line:20%
MATT: Emon is very much the central fantasy Metropolis

01:38:20.529 --> 01:38:21.869 line:20%
of this continent,

01:38:21.869 --> 01:38:24.169 line:20%
at least from a human society standpoint.

01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:27.099
And so, these first episodes really kind of introduce us

01:38:27.099 --> 01:38:27.932
to that place.

01:38:27.932 --> 01:38:30.599
SAM: The initial sketches that Arthur did of Emon

01:38:30.599 --> 01:38:32.959
were so striking and so epic

01:38:32.959 --> 01:38:34.869
in scale and scope

01:38:34.869 --> 01:38:38.009
that we had to go back and look at Matt's original drawings

01:38:38.009 --> 01:38:38.842
and be like,

01:38:38.842 --> 01:38:39.848
is this right?

01:38:39.848 --> 01:38:40.909
Does this match?

01:38:40.909 --> 01:38:41.789
And it does.

01:38:41.789 --> 01:38:44.779 line:20%
He took what Matt did on a 2D piece of paper

01:38:44.779 --> 01:38:47.479 line:20%
and turned it into a 3D world.

01:38:47.479 --> 01:38:49.759
MARISHA: I think when you think of Emon

01:38:49.759 --> 01:38:52.729
compared to other fantasy cities that you know,

01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:53.979
like Rivendell,

01:38:53.979 --> 01:38:58.529
there's gonna be a certain familiarity to Emon

01:38:58.529 --> 01:39:01.749
because it's kind of like a fantasy New York.

01:39:01.749 --> 01:39:03.309
There are elements to it

01:39:03.309 --> 01:39:06.229
that I think everyone can recognize.

01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:07.529
Stylistically.

01:39:07.529 --> 01:39:10.059
ARTHUR: We just wanted to give people a nice way

01:39:10.059 --> 01:39:14.329
to sort of slip into this medieval fantasy world

01:39:14.329 --> 01:39:18.879
without being too challenged with the weirdness of like

01:39:18.879 --> 01:39:21.649
all the other stuff that's going to come later.

01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:22.482 line:20%
MATT: Beyond Emon,

01:39:22.482 --> 01:39:24.429 line:20%
there are a few locations that we get to explore

01:39:24.429 --> 01:39:26.399 line:20%
in the animated series first season.

01:39:26.399 --> 01:39:28.199
Early on we get to visit the Shale Steps,

01:39:28.199 --> 01:39:31.209
which is a place that was not seen in the campaign

01:39:31.209 --> 01:39:32.149
streamed wise

01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:34.659
it's a coastal fishing city

01:39:34.659 --> 01:39:36.929
among a unique looking cliff range.

01:39:36.929 --> 01:39:39.329
That itself looks like waves frozen

01:39:39.329 --> 01:39:42.639
in the motion of crashing onto a shore.

01:39:42.639 --> 01:39:44.569 line:20%
SAM: And then Vox Machina as you know,

01:39:44.569 --> 01:39:47.149 line:20%
makes the journey from Emon to Whitestone.

01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:49.379
And even the journey that they take.

01:39:49.379 --> 01:39:52.129
Arthur has taken again, early maps

01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:55.589
that Matt drew up and turn them into real places

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:56.689
with transitions,

01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:58.619
from forest to desert,

01:39:58.619 --> 01:40:00.769
to jungle, to mountain.

01:40:00.769 --> 01:40:02.979
ARTHUR: We're looking at different landscapes

01:40:02.979 --> 01:40:04.779
existing in the real world.

01:40:04.779 --> 01:40:06.849
Taking ideas from each of them

01:40:06.849 --> 01:40:09.549
and sort of assigning them locations

01:40:09.549 --> 01:40:11.439
within the Critical Role world.

01:40:11.439 --> 01:40:13.759
For example, when we get closer to Whitestone,

01:40:13.759 --> 01:40:16.339
things look a bit more like Yosemite,

01:40:16.339 --> 01:40:17.839
it's the Alabaster Sierras.

01:40:17.839 --> 01:40:20.949
So we picked from the actual high Sierras

01:40:20.949 --> 01:40:22.629
and took those shapes,

01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:24.409
and the way the trees look,

01:40:24.409 --> 01:40:26.979
and the way the vegetation spreads across them

01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:28.169
and assigned it.

01:40:28.169 --> 01:40:31.189
Our other large location for season one

01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:32.489
is going to be Whitestone.

01:40:33.679 --> 01:40:36.899
The architectural language we really wanted to play with

01:40:36.899 --> 01:40:39.039
and make sure that it felt authentic.

01:40:39.039 --> 01:40:41.319
SAM: He went back into the history of the world

01:40:41.319 --> 01:40:42.629
and the history of the continent

01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:43.462
and thought,

01:40:43.462 --> 01:40:46.269
if people had sailed here via a boat,

01:40:46.269 --> 01:40:48.179
what would their architecture like?

01:40:48.179 --> 01:40:50.039
ARTHUR: So, all of our buildings kind of have

01:40:50.039 --> 01:40:53.699
this feeling of like a ship's bow coming out of the ground.

01:40:53.699 --> 01:40:57.319
All the rooftops have sort of that sloping ships hull

01:40:57.319 --> 01:40:58.429
sort of shape to it.

01:40:58.429 --> 01:40:59.749
SAM: And that's something that

01:40:59.749 --> 01:41:01.409
none of us would have ever thought of.

01:41:01.409 --> 01:41:02.689
Not even Matt, really.

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:05.859
TRAVIS: You can't really mention the city of Whitestone

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:07.599
without mentioning the Sun Tree.

01:41:07.599 --> 01:41:09.679
LAURA: The first time I saw the Sun Tree

01:41:09.679 --> 01:41:13.419
(sighs)
It was so epic.

01:41:13.419 --> 01:41:16.759
I've seen some fantastic iterations of the Sun Tree

01:41:16.759 --> 01:41:18.239
but what Arthur dropped on us,

01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:20.139
the first time that we saw the Sun Tree

01:41:20.139 --> 01:41:22.409
literally made our jaws drop.

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:25.689
SUNG: I'm personally more a fan of the small moments.

01:41:25.689 --> 01:41:28.159
So, Gilmore's Goods.

01:41:28.159 --> 01:41:31.109
ASHLEY: It's something that we've pictured in our head for so long

01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:33.899
of what Gilmore's Glorious Goods looks like.

01:41:33.899 --> 01:41:35.439
There's so much detail.

01:41:35.439 --> 01:41:37.299
It's very specific.

01:41:37.299 --> 01:41:39.849 line:20%
That was another thing that kind of took me by surprise

01:41:39.849 --> 01:41:42.219 line:20%
is sort of the work that everyone put in

01:41:42.219 --> 01:41:44.659
to understand the world

01:41:44.659 --> 01:41:46.839
that we've been playing in for the past five years.

01:41:46.839 --> 01:41:48.739
And it's beautiful.

01:41:48.739 --> 01:41:50.109
It's so good.

01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:53.089
ARTHUR: All of our locations are very unique from each other

01:41:53.089 --> 01:41:55.629
and we've gone to great lengths

01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:59.649
to make sure that every element we include in every scene

01:41:59.649 --> 01:42:02.379
really expresses the world as clearly

01:42:02.379 --> 01:42:04.529
and takes it further than whatever

01:42:04.529 --> 01:42:07.159
we were originally seeing in the stream online.

01:42:07.159 --> 01:42:09.619 line:20%
TALIESIN: You really feel like these are drawings of real places

01:42:09.619 --> 01:42:12.256 line:20%
and not just a quick sketch of a random temple.

01:42:12.256 --> 01:42:13.599
(energetic upbeat music )

01:42:13.599 --> 01:42:14.659
SUNG: All starts on paper,

01:42:14.659 --> 01:42:18.179
a bunch of just words describing characters in a story.

01:42:18.179 --> 01:42:21.219
Then we start to try and visualize it with Arthur's team.

01:42:21.219 --> 01:42:23.209
ARTHUR: It's a multistage process.

01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:25.009
We start with storyboards

01:42:25.009 --> 01:42:26.039
that we're working off of

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:28.619
that sort of give us an idea what the shot is,

01:42:28.619 --> 01:42:30.169
where characters are gonna be standing

01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:32.449
and what the general action of the scene is.

01:42:32.449 --> 01:42:34.449
And then a background designer

01:42:34.449 --> 01:42:36.389
is going to take that storyboard

01:42:36.389 --> 01:42:39.429
and just really flesh out the composition,

01:42:39.429 --> 01:42:42.019
figure out what design elements we want in there.

01:42:42.019 --> 01:42:43.769
A background painter takes it next

01:42:43.769 --> 01:42:44.879
adds lighting.

01:42:44.879 --> 01:42:46.859
That lighting is basically used

01:42:46.859 --> 01:42:49.129
to enhance the storytelling moment.

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:52.029
TRAVIS: A really good background by itself without anything else,

01:42:52.029 --> 01:42:53.209
evokes emotion.

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:54.789
It tells you instantly

01:42:54.789 --> 01:42:56.459
what the scene is going to be like.

01:42:56.459 --> 01:42:58.469
ARTHUR: It's a lot like a DP for live action.

01:42:58.469 --> 01:42:59.949
You're trying to express

01:42:59.949 --> 01:43:01.469
what the story is telling you

01:43:01.469 --> 01:43:03.029
through light and color.

01:43:03.029 --> 01:43:03.909
TALIESIN: When it comes,

01:43:03.909 --> 01:43:05.749
not even just to animation,

01:43:05.749 --> 01:43:07.469
but film in general,

01:43:07.469 --> 01:43:09.109
framing is everything.

01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:10.849
Wherever you place your characters

01:43:10.849 --> 01:43:12.089
and wherever you place your action

01:43:12.089 --> 01:43:13.779
is going to have an intense impact

01:43:13.779 --> 01:43:15.469
on how the audience feels

01:43:15.469 --> 01:43:17.569
and how the audience relates to what's happening.

01:43:17.569 --> 01:43:19.589
MATT: It's wild to do all these different things

01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:21.249
and then have them slowly converge

01:43:21.249 --> 01:43:23.469
into one final piece of media.

01:43:23.469 --> 01:43:26.499
TRAVIS: We have many, many more months of production ahead of us.

01:43:26.499 --> 01:43:28.549
ARTHUR: We're getting into the nitty gritty of it.

01:43:28.549 --> 01:43:30.689
It's a never ending circle of

01:43:30.689 --> 01:43:32.769
SAM: work, and creativity, and energy

01:43:32.769 --> 01:43:34.139
that's going into the series.

01:43:34.139 --> 01:43:35.849
ASHLEY: Finally, all of this work,

01:43:35.849 --> 01:43:37.969
it's all come to fruition.

01:43:37.969 --> 01:43:39.129
SUNG: We're really trying to elevate ourselves

01:43:39.129 --> 01:43:40.529
to create an animated show

01:43:40.529 --> 01:43:42.239
that even we've never done before.

01:43:42.239 --> 01:43:44.999 line:20%
I think the fans and Critters are gonna be floored

01:43:44.999 --> 01:43:46.269 line:20%
by what we've made for them.

01:43:46.269 --> 01:43:47.598
BRANDON: You ain't seen nothing yet.

01:43:47.598 --> 01:43:51.015
(energetic upbeat music)

01:44:10.710 --> 01:44:12.840
LAURA: Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:15.762
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:44:15.762 --> 01:44:17.170
(upbeat retro music)

01:44:17.170 --> 01:44:18.780
Ooh, look at this!

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:20.653
Look at the details, ooh!

01:44:21.712 --> 01:44:23.230
(paper scratches)

01:44:23.230 --> 01:44:25.349
It's so cute, I can't handle it!

01:44:25.349 --> 01:44:27.415
(cat meows)

01:44:27.415 --> 01:44:28.740
(bright tone)

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.750
Darling, I recommend buying two.

01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:34.180
One for you and another for you.

01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:35.370
Let's be honest.

01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:36.700
(water burbles)

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:39.030
You're only like five clicks away from owning this.

01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:41.570
Maybe more if you have a lot of windows open

01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:43.799
on your browser, I don't know your life?

01:44:43.799 --> 01:44:45.033
(thunder rumbles)

01:44:45.033 --> 01:44:46.810
This is a lot of stuff you guys.

01:44:46.810 --> 01:44:49.313
We have like so many cool things right now.

01:44:50.279 --> 01:44:51.112
(mouse clicks)

01:44:51.112 --> 01:44:52.680
All of this and more now available

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.066
in the Critical Role shop.

01:44:54.066 --> 01:44:57.149
(upbeat retro music)

01:45:02.761 --> 01:45:05.334
(grunts)

01:45:05.334 --> 01:45:06.167
(laughs)

01:45:06.167 --> 01:45:07.690
Would you look at that?

01:45:07.690 --> 01:45:09.090
I think it worked.

01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:11.130
You were right Pumat number three.

01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:14.233
All we had to do was invoke that subscription, cantrip.

01:45:15.324 --> 01:45:16.523
Pumat number three?

01:45:19.570 --> 01:45:21.930
Oh boy, well, hello there.

01:45:21.930 --> 01:45:23.420
I am Pumat Prime.

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:27.125
It's good to finally join you here in the Prime dimension.

01:45:27.125 --> 01:45:31.593
I see this as the Twitch Prime realm I think.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.840
Oh, we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:39.049
MATT: Well, would you look at that, you got chat and everything.

01:45:39.049 --> 01:45:39.882
(laughs)

01:45:39.882 --> 01:45:43.350
Respectfully, I was looking for the Prime Rib realm,

01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:46.020
but this isn't too bad.

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.260
You see, if you already have access

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:51.360
to the Amazon Prime realm, you can get a free subscription

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.200
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.010
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship

01:45:57.010 --> 01:45:59.510
after that peace treaty, the Prime minister signed

01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:01.110
a few years back.

01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:03.170
You just have to remember to renew

01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:04.440
your Twitch Prime subscription

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.870
at the top of each month, respectfully.

01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:09.930
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:12.460
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:15.210
using the gift to sub button,

01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:18.340
that is assuming the empire hasn't sent a tax man

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:19.740
to your shop here recently.

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:22.300
(laughs)

01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:23.650
All right, well, off to find

01:46:23.650 --> 01:46:26.010
that darn elusive Prime Rib realm.

01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:30.362
Who knew the Prime dimension had so many pockets, good luck.

01:46:30.362 --> 01:46:31.601
(chuckles)

01:46:31.601 --> 01:46:33.356
(footsteps clacks)

01:46:33.356 --> 01:46:37.906
Pumat three?

01:46:37.906 --> 01:46:42.906
TALIESIN (V.O.): Subscribe, resubscribe.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:47.953
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

01:59:44.868 --> 01:59:47.263
MATT: Welcome back. So.

01:59:48.677 --> 01:59:50.198
Four days until Traveler Con.

01:59:50.198 --> 01:59:53.381
You guys have amassed yourselves as the hunting crew.

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:55.587
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:59:55.587 --> 01:59:58.123
LAURA: How did I forget that's what we were doing?

01:59:58.123 --> 01:59:59.860
TRAVIS: We were talking about cereal.

01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:02.768
TALIESIN: ♪ (Jurassic Park theme) ♪

02:00:02.768 --> 02:00:04.248
MATT: With you guys being the hunting crew,

02:00:04.248 --> 02:00:06.208
we'll say that Kieren and Ashelyn decide

02:00:06.208 --> 02:00:08.237
to stay back and help in other elements

02:00:08.237 --> 02:00:10.720
so I don't have to also control two NPCs in this.

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.088
Seven people on this hunting crew is enough.

02:00:14.088 --> 02:00:15.865
They both go, "Oh, oh, you've got this.

02:00:15.865 --> 02:00:16.898
"Oh, it's fine."

02:00:16.898 --> 02:00:19.348
TRAVIS: But we can't turn into bears, so...

02:00:19.348 --> 02:00:20.540
MATT: "Takes a lot of energy.

02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:22.597
"We have a lot to build here and fix, you understand."

02:00:22.597 --> 02:00:24.038
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

02:00:24.038 --> 02:00:25.233
MATT: "Enjoy."

02:00:26.457 --> 02:00:29.668
MARISHA: That gazebo better be done by the time we get back!

02:00:29.668 --> 02:00:32.238
MATT: All right, who is helming the hunt?

02:00:32.238 --> 02:00:36.261
Who is actively stalking a Tyrannosaurus?

02:00:36.261 --> 02:00:39.610
MARISHA: Who's good at survival? Yeah.

02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:41.798
Oh no.
ASHLEY: I'm okay in survival.

02:00:41.798 --> 02:00:43.008
LAURA: Plus five.

02:00:43.008 --> 02:00:44.697
MARISHA: Yours?
ASHLEY: You're plus five?

02:00:44.697 --> 02:00:47.393
LAURA: Plus five survival.
SAM: Really?

02:00:47.393 --> 02:00:48.226
ASHLEY: You need to take this.

02:00:48.226 --> 02:00:50.658
MARISHA: It's your convention.
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

02:00:50.658 --> 02:00:54.272
LAURA: Let's find this T-Rex.
MARISHA: Are we finding a T-Rex?

02:00:54.272 --> 02:00:55.331
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:00:55.331 --> 02:00:57.328
LIAM: Yes, a T-Rex.
ASHLEY: Yes, a T-Rex?

02:00:57.328 --> 02:01:00.248
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, a T-Rex.

02:01:00.248 --> 02:01:02.658
Nothing else will do but a T-Rex.

02:01:02.658 --> 02:01:06.268
TRAVIS: Yeah, we knew this the moment we let it go.

02:01:06.268 --> 02:01:08.333
ASHLEY: The moment we laid eyes on him, we were like:

02:01:08.333 --> 02:01:09.853
That's going to be a tasty treat.
MARISHA: We did want to kill him.

02:01:09.853 --> 02:01:10.937
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Traveler Con,

02:01:10.937 --> 02:01:11.868
yeah, yeah, yeah, fine, fine, fine.

02:01:11.868 --> 02:01:14.201
Where's the T-Rex?
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.

02:01:14.201 --> 02:01:16.535
(laughter)

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:20.508
MATT: All right. Who's helming this?

02:01:20.508 --> 02:01:21.718
Are you doing this alone?

02:01:21.718 --> 02:01:22.998
LIAM: Caleb, do you want to help Jester

02:01:22.998 --> 02:01:26.248
because you remembered exactly where we were in the forest?

02:01:26.248 --> 02:01:27.748
LIAM: Well, I know where we saw that T-Rex a few days ago.

02:01:27.748 --> 02:01:29.398
LAURA: Let's go back to where we saw the T-Rex.

02:01:29.398 --> 02:01:31.558
LIAM: Yeah, I will assist.

02:01:31.558 --> 02:01:34.590
LAURA: Then we'll look for tracks, or something.

02:01:34.590 --> 02:01:36.158
MATT: Okay.

02:01:36.158 --> 02:01:39.368
Along the way, go ahead and roll a survival check for me.

02:01:39.368 --> 02:01:40.308
If you're helping.
LIAM: I'm giving it to her.

02:01:40.308 --> 02:01:42.208
MATT: Then you have advantage on this.

02:01:43.476 --> 02:01:44.956
LIAM: It was somewhere around here, Jester.

02:01:44.956 --> 02:01:46.170
LAURA: 18.

02:01:46.170 --> 02:01:47.529
MATT: 18, okay.

02:01:48.858 --> 02:01:49.691
You take--

02:01:49.691 --> 02:01:51.178
LAURA: Oh, I should've guided myself.

02:01:51.178 --> 02:01:52.524
MATT and LAURA: Too late.

02:01:53.368 --> 02:01:56.348
MATT: Pushing forward into the
first few hours of your journey,

02:01:56.348 --> 02:01:59.666
you trek through familiar territory of the jungle.

02:02:00.748 --> 02:02:02.638
Making your way towards the region

02:02:02.638 --> 02:02:06.078
where the vegetation begins to wither and gray.

02:02:06.078 --> 02:02:07.158
The space where you encountered

02:02:07.158 --> 02:02:10.188
your first undead-type creature.

02:02:10.188 --> 02:02:13.798
Skirting around it to avoid the majority of the pitfalls

02:02:13.798 --> 02:02:17.608
that seem to plague Caduceus your first time through.

02:02:18.698 --> 02:02:21.068
Pretty sure it's not happening again.

02:02:21.068 --> 02:02:24.498
You feel like you may have found some tracks

02:02:25.568 --> 02:02:27.508
earlier than you anticipated.

02:02:27.508 --> 02:02:29.778
You begin to follow them a little bit

02:02:29.778 --> 02:02:31.918
to a northward direction, diverging from

02:02:31.918 --> 02:02:34.148
the path you guys first walked to the volcano.

02:02:34.148 --> 02:02:35.118
Go ahead and roll again for me

02:02:35.118 --> 02:02:36.311
to see if you can maintain the tracks.

02:02:36.311 --> 02:02:38.011
LAURA: Guidance.
MATT: You found a

02:02:38.011 --> 02:02:40.748
set of tracks, large, heavy divots

02:02:40.748 --> 02:02:45.138
in the thick, moist mud and underbrush.

02:02:45.138 --> 02:02:46.788
TRAVIS: Three-pronged?

02:02:46.788 --> 02:02:48.178
MATT: Looks to be.
LAURA: 16.

02:02:48.178 --> 02:02:49.648
MATT: 16, okay.

02:02:49.648 --> 02:02:53.131
You maintain tracking this space.

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.469
It weaves a bit and you do eventually come upon

02:02:58.469 --> 02:03:00.758
something in the way.

02:03:00.758 --> 02:03:02.658
You see a large shape.

02:03:02.658 --> 02:03:05.718
As you begin to move around to get a look,

02:03:05.718 --> 02:03:08.258
you see bone protrusions.

02:03:08.258 --> 02:03:10.308
As you get a closer look, you can see

02:03:10.308 --> 02:03:13.398
the better part of a mostly-eaten carcass.

02:03:13.398 --> 02:03:16.238
Some sort of a heavy-furred beast,

02:03:16.238 --> 02:03:19.758
what could've been an ape

02:03:19.758 --> 02:03:22.898
of some kind, like a larger primate-type creature,

02:03:22.898 --> 02:03:27.298
but it is mostly just thick, blood-soaked fur patches

02:03:27.298 --> 02:03:30.108
and exposed bone that is broken, splintered

02:03:30.108 --> 02:03:33.178
and flesh just torn off in strips, mostly devoured.

02:03:33.178 --> 02:03:36.809
The innards of the main chest cavity is just empty.

02:03:39.658 --> 02:03:43.928
But the tracks continue southward.

02:03:43.928 --> 02:03:46.018
Go ahead and make another survival check for me.

02:03:46.018 --> 02:03:47.048
LAURA: Guidance.

02:03:47.048 --> 02:03:48.548
SAM: With advantage, or anything?

02:03:48.548 --> 02:03:51.418
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, because Caleb's helping me, right?

02:03:51.418 --> 02:03:52.251
Right?

02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:53.711
Is it still advantage?
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:59.548 --> 02:04:03.001
LAURA: Ooh, 21.

02:04:03.918 --> 02:04:05.491
MATT: 21.
TRAVIS: Did you roll twice?

02:04:06.332 --> 02:04:08.333
LAURA: I have an advantage dice.

02:04:08.333 --> 02:04:12.238
MATT: Okay. You notice, where that corpse is,

02:04:12.238 --> 02:04:15.888
there are actually two sets of prints that diverge.

02:04:15.888 --> 02:04:19.248
One that continues in a north, northeastern direction

02:04:19.248 --> 02:04:22.648
and one that's the southern path that you began to follow.

02:04:22.648 --> 02:04:26.558
Of the two sets, you begin to notice there might have been

02:04:26.558 --> 02:04:29.828
a pair that were hunting or they came at different times

02:04:29.828 --> 02:04:31.448
and one scavenged the other's kill.

02:04:31.448 --> 02:04:32.448
You're uncertain.

02:04:32.448 --> 02:04:34.101
They seem to be similar.

02:04:34.978 --> 02:04:38.078
But the southern prints are heavier.

02:04:38.078 --> 02:04:40.318
They sink deeper into the mud

02:04:40.318 --> 02:04:42.858
and seem to be slightly larger than the other set.

02:04:42.858 --> 02:04:44.868
LAURA: Do you want to go after--

02:04:44.868 --> 02:04:47.666
LIAM: Probably more meat on the bones of the bigger one.

02:04:47.666 --> 02:04:50.278
LAURA: That's true.
ASHLEY: If it's a heavier foot fall,

02:04:50.278 --> 02:04:52.488
more meat.
LAURA: Big one, or little one?

02:04:52.488 --> 02:04:54.218
What do you think, guys?

02:04:54.218 --> 02:04:56.101
TRAVIS: Go big or go home, right?

02:04:56.101 --> 02:04:58.438
MARISHA: Maybe the bigger one is more clumsy,

02:04:58.438 --> 02:05:00.843
easier to take down, an easier fight?

02:05:00.843 --> 02:05:03.078
SAM: This is for the Traveler.

02:05:03.078 --> 02:05:06.918
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This all serves a really good purpose,

02:05:06.918 --> 02:05:08.508
what we're doing right now.

02:05:08.508 --> 02:05:09.658
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:05:09.658 --> 02:05:11.168
MARISHA: Maybe we kill the big one

02:05:11.168 --> 02:05:13.888
and you make the smaller one your mount,

02:05:13.888 --> 02:05:16.331
and we can offer T-Rex rides.

02:05:17.421 --> 02:05:19.212
LAURA: That could be really cool.
TRAVIS: I think we're getting a little

02:05:19.212 --> 02:05:20.045
ahead of ourselves.

02:05:20.045 --> 02:05:21.818
MARISHA: Okay, am I Caleb and the dicks?

02:05:21.818 --> 02:05:24.258
Too many dicks?
SAM: You Caleb'd the dick

02:05:24.258 --> 02:05:25.433
on that one.
MARISHA: I Caleb'd the dick.

02:05:25.433 --> 02:05:27.191
(laughter)

02:05:27.191 --> 02:05:29.170
TRAVIS: It was really loud last time, too, right?

02:05:29.170 --> 02:05:30.894
We should be hearing something.

02:05:31.738 --> 02:05:34.788
LAURA: Yeah, we should maybe be a little stealthy.

02:05:34.788 --> 02:05:35.688
MARISHA: It was taking down trees.

02:05:35.688 --> 02:05:37.308
LAURA: How fresh do these tracks look?

02:05:37.308 --> 02:05:38.768
Like I would know.

02:05:38.768 --> 02:05:40.138
MATT: With that roll of a survival check,

02:05:40.138 --> 02:05:42.208
you go ahead and get down.

02:05:42.208 --> 02:05:46.078
An unexpected series of maneuvers from Jester

02:05:46.078 --> 02:05:48.748
as she puts her fingers in the muck,

02:05:48.748 --> 02:05:53.048
tastes the moisture level, glances around and inspects

02:05:53.048 --> 02:05:56.428
some of the nearby splintered portions of various trees

02:05:56.428 --> 02:05:58.178
and trunks that seemed to have been brushed against

02:05:58.178 --> 02:06:01.970
as this creature barreled its way
through the jungle here at Rumblecusp.

02:06:03.248 --> 02:06:05.473
Maybe an hour, hour and a half.

02:06:05.473 --> 02:06:06.391
LAURA: Ooh.

02:06:06.391 --> 02:06:08.308
MARISHA: Why did you eat the mud, though?

02:06:08.308 --> 02:06:10.248
LAURA: I don't know, I just thought I heard

02:06:10.248 --> 02:06:11.818
of people doing that when they were tracking.

02:06:11.818 --> 02:06:13.248
MARISHA: It makes you look super cool.

02:06:13.248 --> 02:06:14.654
LAURA: Did it look like I knew what I was doing?

02:06:14.654 --> 02:06:15.714
MARISHA: It 100% did.

02:06:15.714 --> 02:06:17.988
TRAVIS: What does it taste like?

02:06:17.988 --> 02:06:21.788
LAURA: Have you ever eaten dirt?

02:06:21.788 --> 02:06:23.378
TRAVIS: Not on the reg.

02:06:23.378 --> 02:06:24.928
LAURA: It tastes like that.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:06:25.968 --> 02:06:30.968
MATT: However, because of the state that the corpse is in,

02:06:31.128 --> 02:06:32.948
the kill is not as fresh as the tracks,

02:06:32.948 --> 02:06:34.758
which leads you to believe the larger one may have been

02:06:34.758 --> 02:06:39.758
scavenging an earlier kill from another similar creature.

02:06:39.778 --> 02:06:40.718
SAM: So he's lazy.

02:06:40.718 --> 02:06:42.908
This is good.
LAURA: He's a lazy T-Rex.

02:06:42.908 --> 02:06:45.118
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah.

02:06:45.118 --> 02:06:46.258
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:06:46.258 --> 02:06:48.448
ASHLEY: Maybe he's too big to fight.

02:06:48.448 --> 02:06:52.018
LAURA: Maybe he's big and he's old and some of his teeth

02:06:52.018 --> 02:06:54.589
have fallen out, or something, so he has to--

02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:55.433
SAM: Senile.

02:06:55.433 --> 02:06:58.844
TRAVIS: We're assigning all the shitty attributes.

02:06:58.844 --> 02:07:02.136
He's an old T-Rex that isn't going to taste very good.

02:07:03.008 --> 02:07:05.668
TALIESIN: Gamey, very gamey.

02:07:05.668 --> 02:07:10.668
LAURA: I'm going to put my hand on the nearest tree.

02:07:10.671 --> 02:07:12.567
LAURA: I'm going to put my hand on the nearest tree.

02:07:12.567 --> 02:07:13.400
MATT: Okay.

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:15.268
LAURA: I'm going to talk to some plants.

02:07:15.268 --> 02:07:18.078
MATT: All right, talk to some plants, Jester.

02:07:18.078 --> 02:07:18.911
LAURA: Hey, tree.

02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:21.203
MATT: (old voice) "Yeah."

02:07:21.203 --> 02:07:22.758
LAURA: You seen a T-Rex?

02:07:22.758 --> 02:07:26.348
You seen a big lizard, T-Rexy thing come through here?

02:07:26.348 --> 02:07:28.458
MATT: "Yeah, it comes through every now and then.

02:07:28.458 --> 02:07:30.468
"It's real scary."

02:07:30.468 --> 02:07:33.371
(laughter)

02:07:33.371 --> 02:07:34.921
LAURA: Like, how big?

02:07:36.058 --> 02:07:38.268
Is it bigger than you are?

02:07:38.268 --> 02:07:39.898
Taller than you?

02:07:39.898 --> 02:07:42.158
MATT: "It's hard to really compare mass

02:07:42.158 --> 02:07:44.748
"when you're a tree versus a creature.

02:07:44.748 --> 02:07:47.922
"I'm definitely taller, but it's a little wider.

02:07:47.922 --> 02:07:49.568
"And it moves around.

02:07:49.568 --> 02:07:50.928
"I'm kind of here, so."

02:07:50.928 --> 02:07:52.478
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:07:54.668 --> 02:07:55.651
ASHLEY: I love this tree.

02:07:56.678 --> 02:07:58.348
LAURA: Have you ever seen it--

02:07:58.348 --> 02:08:00.208
does it seem like it's injured at all?

02:08:00.208 --> 02:08:01.041
Is it old?

02:08:01.041 --> 02:08:02.638
Does it look like it has its teeth?

02:08:03.591 --> 02:08:08.528
MATT: "I didn't get a good look at it because it was scary.

02:08:08.528 --> 02:08:10.938
"But, I mean, it was covered in blood.

02:08:10.938 --> 02:08:12.158
"It might have been hurt."

02:08:12.158 --> 02:08:13.266
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:16.568
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a possibility.

02:08:16.568 --> 02:08:19.788
Do you know which direction it went?

02:08:21.639 --> 02:08:23.438
MATT: "I think it went south."

02:08:23.438 --> 02:08:26.088
LAURA: South, got it.

02:08:26.088 --> 02:08:27.378
Thank you very much, tree.

02:08:27.378 --> 02:08:28.898
MATT: "No worries."

02:08:28.898 --> 02:08:31.378
LAURA: Man, that's a lot of fun, it's a lot of fun.

02:08:31.378 --> 02:08:32.308
We should really find out

02:08:32.308 --> 02:08:33.748
about those trees that are withering.

02:08:33.748 --> 02:08:34.968
We said we were going to help them.

02:08:34.968 --> 02:08:36.696
SAM: We did <i>say</i> that.

02:08:36.696 --> 02:08:38.858
LIAM: We say a lot of things.

02:08:38.858 --> 02:08:40.496
SAM: Every tree has a story.

02:08:40.496 --> 02:08:42.458
ASHLEY: Didn't we essentially help them

02:08:42.458 --> 02:08:46.018
because we made the things go away?

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:48.299
No?
SAM: Sure.

02:08:48.299 --> 02:08:51.177
ASHLEY: We helped them.
TRAVIS: We helped them.

02:08:51.177 --> 02:08:53.648
ASHLEY: We surely did.
TALIESIN: We'll double back.

02:08:53.648 --> 02:08:56.358
MARISHA: Those trees also lost their tree memories, and now

02:08:56.358 --> 02:09:00.216
they're thinking about trees that they fucked 25 years ago.

02:09:00.216 --> 02:09:04.935
(laughter)

02:09:04.935 --> 02:09:07.572
Having their own tree crisis, you know?

02:09:08.738 --> 02:09:10.921
LIAM: Memories of acorns dropping.

02:09:12.405 --> 02:09:14.504
SAM: What, I'm not an oak?

02:09:14.504 --> 02:09:19.168
I'm a birch! I've been living a lie for 25 years!

02:09:19.168 --> 02:09:21.514
MATT: These willows weren't weeping before.

02:09:22.938 --> 02:09:24.104
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:09:26.618 --> 02:09:28.928
MATT: Are you going after the larger southern tracks?

02:09:28.928 --> 02:09:30.696
LAURA: I suppose so?

02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:33.635
TRAVIS: Make a confident decision.

02:09:33.635 --> 02:09:34.708
LAURA: That seems like what all you guys

02:09:34.708 --> 02:09:36.138
wanted to do, right, the bigger one?

02:09:36.138 --> 02:09:38.186
TRAVIS: Confident decision.
SAM: Anything you want, Jester.

02:09:38.186 --> 02:09:40.233
LAURA: Don't put this on me if we all die.

02:09:40.233 --> 02:09:43.620
MARISHA: Chief Jes.
TRAVIS: Go.

02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:45.520
MARISHA: Jester, Esquire.

02:09:46.728 --> 02:09:49.611
LAURA: To me, I feel like--
LIAM: Keep it rolling. Keep 'em coming.

02:09:49.611 --> 02:09:51.248
LAURA: A T-Rex is a T-Rex.

02:09:51.248 --> 02:09:52.814
Why don't we take the smaller one, but?

02:09:52.814 --> 02:09:53.647
TRAVIS: Okay!

02:09:54.818 --> 02:09:56.818
LAURA: The older one is bigger.

02:09:56.818 --> 02:09:58.458
The bigger one is feeble.

02:09:58.458 --> 02:09:59.324
Maybe we should do the bigger one.

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:02.070
TRAVIS: We don't know that at all.

02:10:02.070 --> 02:10:02.903
MARISHA: We were really just saying that

02:10:02.903 --> 02:10:05.848
to make ourselves feel better.
TRAVIS: Just to be clear.

02:10:05.848 --> 02:10:10.178
SAM: You are one of the
two greatest detectives I've ever met.

02:10:10.178 --> 02:10:12.725
If you think that the bigger one is feeble,

02:10:12.725 --> 02:10:14.578
I'm with you 100%.

02:10:14.578 --> 02:10:16.468
You have a sleuthy intuition.

02:10:16.468 --> 02:10:19.126
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:10:19.126 --> 02:10:20.998
It could have three heads!

02:10:20.998 --> 02:10:25.998
MARISHA: It would be like T-Rexes to try and trick us.

02:10:26.455 --> 02:10:27.288
You know?

02:10:27.288 --> 02:10:29.830
TRAVIS: The fucking T-Rexes.

02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:32.288
TALIESIN: What T-Rexes have you met
to draw this sort of conclusion?

02:10:32.288 --> 02:10:34.104
MARISHA: None.
TRAVIS: Just like an asshole T-Rex.

02:10:34.104 --> 02:10:35.370
LIAM: Just the one.

02:10:37.058 --> 02:10:38.666
LAURA: Let's do it. Let's go after the big one.

02:10:38.666 --> 02:10:39.868
I don't know.

02:10:39.868 --> 02:10:42.188
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Your call.

02:10:42.188 --> 02:10:44.248
MATT: You continue to track the larger set of tracks.

02:10:44.248 --> 02:10:47.298
SAM: I'm going to hand Jester my--

02:10:47.298 --> 02:10:51.431
I think I have a

02:10:51.431 --> 02:10:53.418
magnifying glass.

02:10:53.418 --> 02:10:54.258
Just to help in the looking.

02:10:54.258 --> 02:10:56.196
LAURA: Thank you, to look for those.

02:10:56.196 --> 02:10:58.311
We should all be pretty stealthy, though.

02:10:59.692 --> 02:11:00.748
MATT: Okay, you're beginning to stealth.

02:11:00.748 --> 02:11:01.581
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:01.581 --> 02:11:02.728
MATT: All right, I'd like everyone to go ahead

02:11:02.728 --> 02:11:04.438
and roll a stealth check, please.

02:11:04.438 --> 02:11:05.408
A communal party stealth check.

02:11:05.408 --> 02:11:08.688
LAURA: Guidance. Yasha, I'm going to bless you.

02:11:08.688 --> 02:11:09.648
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:11:09.648 --> 02:11:10.898
LAURA: Blessing of the Trickster.

02:11:12.038 --> 02:11:14.668
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
MARISHA: Natural 20!

02:11:14.668 --> 02:11:15.798
MATT: Nice.
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:11:15.798 --> 02:11:16.631
TALIESIN: Hey.

02:11:17.826 --> 02:11:19.011
ASHLEY: I had 20, total.

02:11:19.974 --> 02:11:21.322
SAM: 29.

02:11:21.322 --> 02:11:22.808
MATT: All right, 20 total?
ASHLEY: 20 total.

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:24.240
TALIESIN: 19.

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:26.248
LAURA: You get advantage.
ASHLEY: I get advantage?

02:11:26.248 --> 02:11:27.621
MATT: Jester.
LAURA: 16.

02:11:28.758 --> 02:11:31.281
ASHLEY: Yeah, 20 total.
MATT: That's pretty solid.

02:11:32.428 --> 02:11:35.528
You guys follow these tracks, keeping behind Jester

02:11:35.528 --> 02:11:38.921
for the better part of the next 30 or so minutes.

02:11:39.788 --> 02:11:42.878
Jester, you follow the heavy footfalls,

02:11:42.878 --> 02:11:45.198
the smashed, fallen log that appears to have been

02:11:45.198 --> 02:11:48.098
stepped on, fell through from the weight of the beast.

02:11:48.098 --> 02:11:49.378
Eventually, you come upon

02:11:49.378 --> 02:11:52.918
a couple of other tattered corpses of these larger,

02:11:52.918 --> 02:11:55.998
crane-like birds that are just crushed and thrown.

02:11:55.998 --> 02:11:59.018
One has been pressed into a tree with such force.

02:11:59.018 --> 02:12:02.158
It was jammed into that it's been smeared and it's

02:12:02.158 --> 02:12:05.468
now stuck, partially, against the bark of this tree.

02:12:05.468 --> 02:12:09.368
You can see its neck is hanging limply

02:12:09.368 --> 02:12:12.071
as it's slowly dripping.

02:12:13.238 --> 02:12:14.904
You also hear this sound.

02:12:15.913 --> 02:12:18.626
(slow, deep, heavy breathing)

02:12:18.626 --> 02:12:19.966
LAURA: It's sleeping.

02:12:19.966 --> 02:12:22.707
MATT: (slow, deep, heavy breathing)

02:12:23.581 --> 02:12:25.842
SAM: It needs to nap because it's so old.

02:12:25.842 --> 02:12:26.675
LAURA: Yeah.

02:12:28.098 --> 02:12:29.838
MATT: (slow, deep, heavy breathing)

02:12:29.838 --> 02:12:31.018
LAURA: What is it, where is it?

02:12:31.018 --> 02:12:31.948
Can we see where the sound is coming from?

02:12:31.948 --> 02:12:34.828
MATT: As you begin to make your way over this slight hill,

02:12:34.828 --> 02:12:39.058
you come to this divot in the jungle floor.

02:12:39.058 --> 02:12:42.931
There, you see, curled up in this muddier pit,

02:12:45.728 --> 02:12:50.178
a fully albino Tyrannosaurus Rex

02:12:50.178 --> 02:12:53.268
that is older

02:12:53.268 --> 02:12:54.978
and more massive than the one you had

02:12:54.978 --> 02:12:58.158
encountered previously coming through the jungle.

02:12:58.158 --> 02:13:00.538
As it's lying there, you can see across its

02:13:00.538 --> 02:13:03.818
gray-white scaled pallet of skin.

02:13:03.818 --> 02:13:06.038
There are smatterings of dried blood,

02:13:06.038 --> 02:13:08.258
of multiple shades of red from multiple creatures

02:13:08.258 --> 02:13:11.178
that it came across as it was tearing through the jungle.

02:13:11.178 --> 02:13:12.608
You can see why it was important

02:13:12.608 --> 02:13:14.608
for Vilya to keep watch on this village.

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:19.258
Good luck for the rest of the folks here if she leaves.

02:13:19.258 --> 02:13:21.668
Maybe hunting this T-Rex was a very good idea.

02:13:21.668 --> 02:13:24.078
If you survive.

02:13:24.078 --> 02:13:28.008
But there it is now, snoring heavily post-meal,

02:13:28.008 --> 02:13:30.028
in the middle of the jungle.

02:13:30.028 --> 02:13:30.861
What do you do?

02:13:30.861 --> 02:13:32.801
LAURA: We could surprise attack it. Everybody hit at once.

02:13:32.801 --> 02:13:34.251
MATT: I should set the scene, if you don't mind.

02:13:34.251 --> 02:13:36.426
(exclaiming)

02:13:36.426 --> 02:13:39.078
ASHLEY: He has something prepared?!

02:13:39.078 --> 02:13:39.911
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Of course he did.

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:43.026
SAM: This impromptu combat, that somehow
Matt was prepared for--

02:13:43.026 --> 02:13:43.868
TRAVIS: Sure, always.

02:13:43.868 --> 02:13:45.658
SAM: -- is sponsored by Dwarven Forge.

02:13:45.658 --> 02:13:47.526
The journey out into the Wildlands,

02:13:47.526 --> 02:13:49.928
Dwarven Forge's eighth terrain Kickstarter is live.

Check it out at dwarvenforge.com/wildlands.

02:13:53.008 --> 02:13:54.718
Matt, what, how?

02:13:54.718 --> 02:13:55.871
MATT: Because-- at break.

02:13:57.038 --> 02:13:58.378
LAURA: No way.

02:13:58.378 --> 02:13:59.428
You prepped this at break?

02:13:59.428 --> 02:14:01.310
MATT: I build maps during break all the time.

02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:03.131
SAM: But we didn't see you do it!

02:14:03.131 --> 02:14:06.048
MARISHA: He always has six maps at any point in time.

02:14:06.048 --> 02:14:07.245
SAM: Wow!
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:14:07.245 --> 02:14:10.678
ASHLEY and LAURA: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: It just occurred to me.

02:14:10.678 --> 02:14:13.881
MATT: Because I wasn't expecting
you guys to go battle a T-Rex,

02:14:13.881 --> 02:14:17.428
I don't have an albino T-Rex miniature at the ready.

02:14:17.428 --> 02:14:22.285
But we'll just say that this is the general size of it.

02:14:22.285 --> 02:14:24.598
ASHLEY: Look at that cute boy.

02:14:24.598 --> 02:14:26.398
MARISHA: What do you mean you don't have a T-Rex prepared?

02:14:26.398 --> 02:14:29.029
MATT: An albino T-Rex.

02:14:29.029 --> 02:14:32.133
SAM: Under the light, it looks like it.

02:14:32.133 --> 02:14:33.028
MATT: Well, good, look at that.

02:14:33.028 --> 02:14:35.374
Thank you, thank you, our wonderful tech team.

02:14:35.374 --> 02:14:37.350
TALIESIN: Currently prone, I might add.
MATT: What's that?

02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:39.538
TALIESIN: Currently prone.
MATT: Currently prone, yes.

02:14:39.538 --> 02:14:41.948
LIAM: How far from the albino are we?
TRAVIS: Will we have a way to--

02:14:41.948 --> 02:14:44.338
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: -- get this back?

02:14:44.338 --> 02:14:48.588
MATT: You guys are right among this tree line here.

02:14:48.588 --> 02:14:50.268
Where would you like to arrange?

02:14:51.974 --> 02:14:53.963
TALIESIN: I'd like to head north.

02:14:53.963 --> 02:14:56.913
LAURA: I don't want to accidentally
wake it up with our movements.

02:14:57.798 --> 02:15:01.048
Should we all spread out a little bit

02:15:01.048 --> 02:15:03.538
and then hit it all at once.

02:15:03.538 --> 02:15:05.258
MARISHA: A semicircle type of thing.

02:15:05.258 --> 02:15:06.288
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:15:06.288 --> 02:15:08.058
ASHLEY: I feel bad because he's sleeping.

02:15:08.058 --> 02:15:08.891
LAURA: I do, too.

02:15:08.891 --> 02:15:11.925
But he'll attack the village if we don't kill it.

02:15:11.925 --> 02:15:16.018
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
SAM: It's a mercy killing, really.

02:15:16.018 --> 02:15:17.381
MARISHA: Because he's so old.

02:15:18.238 --> 02:15:19.071
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:15:19.071 --> 02:15:22.888
TRAVIS: I'll go, if we're starting here, right?

02:15:22.888 --> 02:15:26.051
I'll flank around this way.

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:28.028
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us

02:15:28.028 --> 02:15:31.518
to keep us as quiet as possible as we do this.

02:15:31.518 --> 02:15:32.698
MATT: Okay, I would like all of you

02:15:32.698 --> 02:15:36.858
to re-roll stealth check to Pass Without a Trace.

02:15:36.858 --> 02:15:39.498
LAURA: Oh, like, reroll it, aw.
MATT: Yep.

02:15:39.498 --> 02:15:40.518
LAURA: Would we have to reroll

02:15:40.518 --> 02:15:43.078
it if I hadn't cast Pass Without a Trace?

02:15:43.078 --> 02:15:44.358
MATT: As you guys are now approaching

02:15:44.358 --> 02:15:46.148
and spreading out in preparation for this,

02:15:46.148 --> 02:15:47.451
there would be an additional stealth check.

02:15:47.451 --> 02:15:49.018
You are helping.

02:15:49.018 --> 02:15:50.178
TRAVIS: 26.

02:15:50.178 --> 02:15:52.008
LAURA: Oh wait, no, it's not advantage.

02:15:52.008 --> 02:15:53.083
Add 10.

02:15:56.107 --> 02:15:56.940
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.

02:15:58.528 --> 02:15:59.361
Nothing to see here?

02:15:59.361 --> 02:16:01.298
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus Christ.

02:16:01.298 --> 02:16:03.545
MATT: Natural one, what's your total?

02:16:04.614 --> 02:16:07.364
TRAVIS: 10 (laughing).

02:16:10.765 --> 02:16:15.765
LAURA: That's 12 plus four is 16.

02:16:15.968 --> 02:16:17.148
LAURA: Hey, that's pretty good.

02:16:17.148 --> 02:16:18.530
TRAVIS: From a natural one, not bad.

02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:20.938
LIAM: 28.
SAM: 34.

02:16:20.938 --> 02:16:23.528
ASHLEY: 25.
TALIESIN: 29.

02:16:23.528 --> 02:16:24.448
MARISHA: 35.

02:16:24.448 --> 02:16:25.918
LAURA: Wow.
ASHLEY: Whoa.

02:16:25.918 --> 02:16:30.918
MATT: You beat Veth at a stealth check.

02:16:31.268 --> 02:16:33.488
SAM: That's pretty impressive.

02:16:33.488 --> 02:16:35.831
MATT: That's really impressive.
LIAM: Because rogues are broken.

02:16:36.858 --> 02:16:37.758
MATT: In some ways, yeah.

02:16:37.758 --> 02:16:39.316
All right, so.

02:16:40.683 --> 02:16:43.648
What you notice, Caduceus,

02:16:43.648 --> 02:16:47.048
as well as Beauregard and Caleb,

02:16:47.048 --> 02:16:50.766
is amongst the carrion smatterings in the space,

02:16:50.766 --> 02:16:55.271
there are some very small birds
that are eating from these corpses.

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:59.658
You begin to wonder if there is

02:16:59.658 --> 02:17:04.018
some sort of a symbiotic relationship between them.

02:17:04.018 --> 02:17:09.018
These small little creatures suddenly begin to (clicking)

02:17:09.068 --> 02:17:10.878
and look around as you guys begin to shift.

02:17:10.878 --> 02:17:13.228
MARISHA: Those fucking birds are going to blow our cover.

02:17:14.148 --> 02:17:16.968
MATT: But do not seem to notice or hear your passage.

02:17:16.968 --> 02:17:18.796
LAURA: Wow, because everybody else rolled so high?

02:17:18.796 --> 02:17:20.441
MATT: Because everyone else rolled super high.

02:17:20.441 --> 02:17:22.405
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: Are they--

02:17:22.405 --> 02:17:23.832
TALIESIN: How big are these birds?
LAURA: I'm going to say that I stayed

02:17:23.832 --> 02:17:24.840
right where I was.

02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.071
MATT: They're a handful size.

02:17:26.908 --> 02:17:28.538
They're small, but you can see them.

02:17:28.538 --> 02:17:29.371
They're all scattered around.

02:17:29.371 --> 02:17:31.758
They all have blood smattering on their beaks.

02:17:31.758 --> 02:17:35.598
They're all very nervous and keeping an eye out.

02:17:37.961 --> 02:17:41.618
You bypass them, luckily.

02:17:41.618 --> 02:17:42.798
Fjord has set himself up there.

02:17:42.798 --> 02:17:43.868
Where is everybody else?

02:17:43.868 --> 02:17:47.398
MARISHA: Can I make my way, ♪ make my way ♪

02:17:47.398 --> 02:17:49.988
and flank across from Fjord, almost?

02:17:49.988 --> 02:17:50.821
MATT: Over here?

02:17:51.871 --> 02:17:53.458
MARISHA: On the other side of the tree.

02:17:53.458 --> 02:17:54.291
MATT: Right here?

02:17:55.748 --> 02:17:56.728
MARISHA: This one's tough because

02:17:56.728 --> 02:17:59.048
there's a tree right in my way there-ish.

02:17:59.048 --> 02:18:00.228
MATT: Oh, over here, I gotcha.
MARISHA: Yes, thank you.

02:18:00.228 --> 02:18:04.178
TRAVIS: Veth, don't you have rouge insta-kill abilities?

02:18:04.178 --> 02:18:05.688
SAM: I do.
TRAVIS: You do?

02:18:05.688 --> 02:18:08.091
SAM: Yes, I can insta-kill any animal.

02:18:09.008 --> 02:18:10.580
I just haven't been using it.

02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:13.825
(laughter)

02:18:13.825 --> 02:18:15.218
TALIESIN: I think claws are technically weapons.

02:18:15.218 --> 02:18:17.325
SAM: It's a broken rogue thing.

02:18:17.325 --> 02:18:18.675
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

02:18:20.678 --> 02:18:21.998
MATT: Who else is where?

02:18:21.998 --> 02:18:25.388
SAM: I would climb a tree, possibly, somewhere.

02:18:25.388 --> 02:18:26.498
Pick a tree, any tree.

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:27.831
MATT: Up here?
SAM: Sure.

02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:30.334
MATT: Put Veth right here.

02:18:30.334 --> 02:18:33.618
TALIESIN: I would like some sort of
log cover about 40 feet away.

02:18:33.618 --> 02:18:34.878
MATT: Make an athletics check for me,

02:18:34.878 --> 02:18:36.148
if you don't mind.
SAM: Oh, good call.

02:18:39.778 --> 02:18:41.298
Yep.

02:18:41.298 --> 02:18:42.131
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:18:42.131 --> 02:18:45.122
SAM: Oh, (chuckling) you want to know the number.

02:18:45.122 --> 02:18:46.811
Yep. (sotto voce) Seven.

02:18:46.811 --> 02:18:48.378
ASHLEY: Oh.
SAM: It was a seven.

02:18:49.668 --> 02:18:52.395
MATT: All right, where are the rest of you?

02:18:52.395 --> 02:18:56.537
ASHLEY: I'm going to go somewhere around there.

02:18:56.537 --> 02:18:58.678
SAM: I have Spider Climb, too.
ASHLEY: Maybe around.

02:18:59.803 --> 02:19:00.891
MATT: Around this side?

02:19:02.508 --> 02:19:04.638
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe a little bit closer.

02:19:04.638 --> 02:19:06.358
I can't really see.

02:19:06.358 --> 02:19:07.738
A little closer to Fjord, maybe.

02:19:07.738 --> 02:19:10.075
MATT: Fjord, over here?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:11.598
MATT: Okay, Caleb?

02:19:11.598 --> 02:19:15.018
LIAM: Would I be able to, while we're sneaking about,

02:19:15.018 --> 02:19:19.068
take out obsidian and cast Resident Echo and split?

02:19:19.068 --> 02:19:19.901
MATT: Sure.

02:19:23.048 --> 02:19:24.221
TRAVIS: I love the crickets.

02:19:25.158 --> 02:19:26.938
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we have a studio cricket.

02:19:26.938 --> 02:19:28.038
SAM: I thought that was Matthew's music.

02:19:28.038 --> 02:19:28.888
TRAVIS: I thought it was the soundtrack.

02:19:28.888 --> 02:19:29.721
ASHLEY: I did, too.

02:19:29.721 --> 02:19:30.859
MATT: No, that is not the soundtrack.

02:19:30.859 --> 02:19:31.692
MARISHA: Oh, do we have a studio cricket?

02:19:31.692 --> 02:19:32.525
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can't hear it?

02:19:32.525 --> 02:19:35.558
MARISHA: No, I can, same thing,
I thought it was in the soundtrack.

02:19:35.558 --> 02:19:36.391
ASHLEY: We do.

02:19:36.391 --> 02:19:38.298
MATT: I think in moving the set pieces over here,

02:19:38.298 --> 02:19:40.168
I cannot find my Resident Echo mini.

02:19:40.168 --> 02:19:42.261
ASHLEY: He's like, "You guys are so dumb, right now."

02:19:43.738 --> 02:19:45.658
LIAM: I've got an invisible person.

02:19:45.658 --> 02:19:49.049
MATT: I have a little black and sparkle-painted Caleb mini,

02:19:49.049 --> 02:19:51.064
but I don't know where it is.

02:19:51.064 --> 02:19:51.897
That's okay.

02:19:51.897 --> 02:19:54.578
I will instead, I'll use--

02:19:54.578 --> 02:19:56.318
ASHLEY: I can't see where I am on here.

02:19:56.318 --> 02:19:57.778
MATT: I'll use this guys as your Resident Echo.

02:19:57.778 --> 02:19:59.448
How about that?
TALIESIN: I have a thought about that.

02:19:59.448 --> 02:20:02.918
LIAM: Resident Echo Caleb will go directly

02:20:02.918 --> 02:20:06.508
on the other side of the big, white dinosaur.

02:20:06.508 --> 02:20:09.728
SAM: Moby Dick. Moby Penis.
MATT: Where are you standing?

02:20:09.728 --> 02:20:11.328
LIAM: That Caleb could stay put.

02:20:11.328 --> 02:20:12.548
MATT: Right there?
LIAM: Yep.

02:20:12.548 --> 02:20:15.608
Just send Resident Echo directly on the other side.

02:20:15.608 --> 02:20:18.590
MATT: Okay, cool, it starts making its way over there.

02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:19.808
Caduceus.

02:20:19.808 --> 02:20:21.334
TALIESIN: Somewhere with a little cover

02:20:21.334 --> 02:20:24.478
a little distant from everyone, about 40 feet away.

02:20:24.478 --> 02:20:27.658
MATT: 40 feet away from?
TALIESIN: From the T-Rex.

02:20:27.658 --> 02:20:29.268
Behind that stump, right there.

02:20:29.268 --> 02:20:31.128
MATT: Over here?
TALIESIN: Is that about 40 feet?

02:20:31.128 --> 02:20:31.961
MATT: That would be about 40 feet from this.

02:20:31.961 --> 02:20:33.308
TALIESIN: Yeah, so behind that.

02:20:33.308 --> 02:20:35.528
MATT: Okay, you're about there, right now.

02:20:35.528 --> 02:20:36.361
Jester?

02:20:38.038 --> 02:20:42.098
LAURA: I'm going to be-- I need to be within 60 feet.

02:20:42.098 --> 02:20:43.408
MATT: That's a pretty decent range

02:20:43.408 --> 02:20:44.383
so where would you like to be within the--?

02:20:44.383 --> 02:20:47.768
LAURA: I'll go on the big tree
with the mushrooms on this side.

02:20:47.768 --> 02:20:49.688
On the other side of it than Caleb.

02:20:49.688 --> 02:20:51.408
The one that Caleb is next to.
MATT: Oh, right here?

02:20:51.408 --> 02:20:52.241
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:52.241 --> 02:20:53.157
MATT: Over there?

02:20:53.157 --> 02:20:55.058
LAURA: To where I have an actual view of him.

02:20:55.058 --> 02:20:56.598
MATT: About there.
LAURA: Yeah, that's good.

02:20:56.598 --> 02:20:58.691
TALIESIN: Are you doing the ray or are you doing?

02:21:00.928 --> 02:21:03.738
ASHLEY: Am I within 50 feet of it, Matt?

02:21:03.738 --> 02:21:04.588
MATT: You are within.

02:21:05.551 --> 02:21:07.228
You guys fan out and start spreading.

02:21:07.228 --> 02:21:08.728
You cast Resident Echo

02:21:08.728 --> 02:21:10.188
and the echo begins to run over there.

02:21:10.188 --> 02:21:11.698
Caduceus, you're making your way to the other side.

02:21:11.698 --> 02:21:14.528
As you all are very carefully making your way through,

02:21:14.528 --> 02:21:16.311
you hear

02:21:16.311 --> 02:21:18.919
(snapping, yelling)

02:21:18.919 --> 02:21:21.661
as Veth, part way up the tree,

02:21:21.661 --> 02:21:23.918
grabs a branch that snaps

02:21:23.918 --> 02:21:26.531
and plummets about 20 feet to the ground.

02:21:27.468 --> 02:21:29.338
TALIESIN: I attack.
MARISHA: We attack.

02:21:29.338 --> 02:21:34.338
MATT: Taking four points of bludgeoning damage as you

02:21:34.701 --> 02:21:37.205
hit the ground, the birds (flitting)

02:21:37.205 --> 02:21:39.578
and go (bird calling).

02:21:39.578 --> 02:21:42.588
As they do (growling).

02:21:42.588 --> 02:21:46.172
You guys do still get a surprise round, except for Veth.

02:21:46.172 --> 02:21:48.037
LAURA: Ah, man.

02:21:48.037 --> 02:21:49.698
SAM: (loudly groaning)

02:21:49.698 --> 02:21:51.738
MATT: I do still need you all to roll initiative, however.

02:21:51.738 --> 02:21:53.208
TRAVIS: Let's roll initiative!

02:21:54.077 --> 02:21:57.674
Give me that death music.

02:21:57.674 --> 02:21:59.758
LIAM: All about that D?

02:21:59.758 --> 02:22:02.298
TALIESIN: All right.
LIAM: Wow.

02:22:02.298 --> 02:22:04.038
TALIESIN: This is Traveler Con.

02:22:04.038 --> 02:22:07.593
(laughter)

02:22:07.593 --> 02:22:09.668
ASHLEY: <i>This</i> is Traveler Con.

02:22:10.598 --> 02:22:12.786
TRAVIS: Get Seacrest in here to launch it.

02:22:12.786 --> 02:22:13.624
MATT: All righty.

02:22:13.624 --> 02:22:15.488
MARISHA: Nope.
MATT: So.

02:22:15.488 --> 02:22:16.401
MATT: 25 to 20.

02:22:17.788 --> 02:22:18.848
LAURA: Cool.
SAM and MARISHA: Yikes.

02:22:18.848 --> 02:22:20.121
MATT: 20 to 15.

02:22:23.528 --> 02:22:26.058
MARISHA: Sorry, 19.
TALIESIN: 18.

02:22:26.058 --> 02:22:28.383
LIAM: 16.
ASHLEY: 19 for me.

02:22:28.383 --> 02:22:29.216
LAURA: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:22:29.216 --> 02:22:32.798
TRAVIS: 19 for you?
LAURA: Wait 19, 19, 18?

02:22:32.798 --> 02:22:36.090
TALIESIN: Yep.
TRAVIS: So Beau, Yasha, Caduceus, Caleb.

02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:38.066
LAURA: And Jester at the same time.

02:22:38.066 --> 02:22:40.420
SAM: And I'm also 16.
LAURA: Oh wow.

02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:41.918
LIAM: I'm 16 as well.

02:22:41.918 --> 02:22:43.798
It's by dex, so you'll probably go first.

02:22:43.798 --> 02:22:45.448
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: Oh yeah.

02:22:45.448 --> 02:22:46.598
SAM: I'm on my ass, though.

02:22:46.598 --> 02:22:48.308
LIAM: What's your dex?

02:22:48.308 --> 02:22:50.419
MATT: 15 to 10.

02:22:50.419 --> 02:22:52.419
TRAVIS: I rolled a nine. I'm the only one left.

02:22:54.528 --> 02:22:55.748
MATT: It's Beau and Yasha at the same time.

02:22:55.748 --> 02:22:59.015
Caduceus, then Caleb, then what did you get?

02:22:59.015 --> 02:23:02.153
LAURA: Caleb, Jester, and Veth all got 16.

02:23:02.153 --> 02:23:03.758
LIAM: Veth, Jester, Caleb, if you go by dexterity.

02:23:03.758 --> 02:23:05.571
LAURA: Yeah, probably.
MATT: Sure, yeah.

02:23:05.571 --> 02:23:07.954
MARISHA: Veth, Jes, Caleb.

02:23:09.058 --> 02:23:11.137
LIAM: Veth, Jes, Lebby.

02:23:11.137 --> 02:23:12.492
LAURA: Fjordy.

02:23:12.492 --> 02:23:13.325
MATT: All right.

02:23:15.008 --> 02:23:15.841
Cool.

02:23:18.268 --> 02:23:22.488
Immediately, the beast's eyes shoot wide open.

02:23:22.488 --> 02:23:26.068
You can see there's this faint,

02:23:26.068 --> 02:23:29.008
pinkish-white tint to the eye.

02:23:29.008 --> 02:23:33.528
Right around the exterior of the slanted pupil,

02:23:33.528 --> 02:23:35.938
there is a deep green coloration.

02:23:35.938 --> 02:23:38.618
It has this odd, almost bruised transition on the inside.

02:23:38.618 --> 02:23:42.343
As it shoots open, the nostrils (panting).

02:23:42.343 --> 02:23:46.258
One leg rights itself and begins to lift up off the ground

02:23:46.258 --> 02:23:49.778
as Beau and Yasha, what are you guys doing?

02:23:49.778 --> 02:23:50.785
ASHLEY: Go for it.

02:23:50.785 --> 02:23:51.928
MARISHA: (yelling loudly)

02:23:51.928 --> 02:23:54.031
Where are you, where are you on the map?

02:23:55.578 --> 02:23:56.468
MATT: Yasha's right there.

02:23:56.468 --> 02:23:58.733
MARISHA: Oh, we're opposites.

02:23:58.733 --> 02:24:02.598
I make eye contact with Yasha across from him

02:24:02.598 --> 02:24:05.549
as we both charge forward.

02:24:05.549 --> 02:24:07.128
MATT: All right, you rush in.

02:24:07.128 --> 02:24:09.252
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Terminator run.

02:24:09.252 --> 02:24:11.568
TRAVIS: Fuck 'em up, T-1000.

02:24:12.443 --> 02:24:13.401
Blade hands.

02:24:13.401 --> 02:24:15.992
LAURA: Is it too late to say I Invoked Duplicity

02:24:15.992 --> 02:24:16.953
before we started all this?

02:24:16.953 --> 02:24:17.853
MATT: Yes.

02:24:17.853 --> 02:24:19.403
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

02:24:21.016 --> 02:24:21.849
MATT: Go for it.

02:24:21.849 --> 02:24:23.978
MARISHA: As I'm running, I reach and I pull out

02:24:23.978 --> 02:24:26.588
my new staff, the Belabor.

02:24:26.588 --> 02:24:31.018
Do a little Jedi spin around as I run

02:24:31.018 --> 02:24:34.110
and a big, old jump and slap, pop, pop.

02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.943
MATT: Go for it.

02:24:36.378 --> 02:24:38.008
MARISHA: Right on its face.

02:24:38.008 --> 02:24:39.228
TRAVIS: Because it's a surprise round,

02:24:39.228 --> 02:24:42.475
do we get any kind of advantage or anything?

02:24:42.475 --> 02:24:43.316
MATT: No.

02:24:43.316 --> 02:24:44.688
TALIESIN: It's still on the ground.

02:24:44.688 --> 02:24:47.018
Some attacks get--
MATT: It is technically

02:24:47.018 --> 02:24:50.309
no longer prone because the lack of--

02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:51.223
TRAVIS: Stealth?
MATT: The breaking of stealth.

02:24:51.223 --> 02:24:52.214
TALIESIN: Damn it.
MATT: But you guys are

02:24:52.214 --> 02:24:53.378
getting a surprise round on it,

02:24:53.378 --> 02:24:55.719
which means you get one to go before it gets to go.

02:24:55.719 --> 02:24:56.608
LAURA: That's cool, that's cool.

02:24:56.608 --> 02:24:58.208
MATT: You still get a major benefit.

02:24:59.053 --> 02:25:01.425
MARISHA: 24 and 16?
MATT: Both hit.

02:25:02.853 --> 02:25:05.244
MARISHA: And that is...

02:25:07.138 --> 02:25:09.841
The first one is nine damage, not great.

02:25:10.838 --> 02:25:14.419
Second one is Stunning Strike.

02:25:14.419 --> 02:25:15.937
MATT: How much damage, though?

02:25:16.232 --> 02:25:17.972
MARISHA: Nine damage on the first one.

02:25:17.972 --> 02:25:20.486
For both of them total, nine damage,

02:25:20.486 --> 02:25:22.252
and then 14 damage.

02:25:22.252 --> 02:25:23.085
MATT: All right.

02:25:23.085 --> 02:25:24.182
MARISHA: And then Stunning Strike.

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:25.082
MATT: Stunning Strike.

02:25:26.711 --> 02:25:28.872
That is an eighteen.

02:25:28.872 --> 02:25:29.962
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:25:29.962 --> 02:25:31.062
MATT: It's a pretty beefy creature.

02:25:31.062 --> 02:25:32.560
Like, its constitution's pretty hardy.

02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:33.393
It doesn't mean it won't work,

02:25:33.393 --> 02:25:35.192
but it resists the first Stunning Strike.

02:25:35.192 --> 02:25:36.025
MARISHA: That's good to know.

02:25:36.025 --> 02:25:38.165
MATT: So first two strikes,

02:25:38.165 --> 02:25:40.908
which also means you do Extract Aspects.

02:25:41.862 --> 02:25:43.672
MARISHA: Well, I didn't do Flurry of Blows.

02:25:43.672 --> 02:25:44.642
MATT: Right.

02:25:44.642 --> 02:25:46.698
MARISHA: But I am now going to do Flurry of Blows.

02:25:46.698 --> 02:25:48.531
MATT: Okay, go for it. Two more strikes.

02:25:50.585 --> 02:25:55.284
MARISHA: Yeah, that is 27 and...

02:25:57.405 --> 02:25:58.347
24.

02:25:58.347 --> 02:25:59.180
MATT: Both hit.

02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:00.013
Go ahead and roll damage on that.

02:26:00.013 --> 02:26:01.745
Yasha, you're on deck.

02:26:02.612 --> 02:26:03.455
MARISHA: Okay.

02:26:05.482 --> 02:26:08.172
10 damage and...

02:26:08.172 --> 02:26:10.110
14 damage.
MATT: Nice.

02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:11.932
MARISHA: And now Extract Aspects.

02:26:11.932 --> 02:26:13.740
MATT: Okay.

02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:16.322
This tyrannosaurus is old, venerable,

02:26:16.322 --> 02:26:17.652
but not to the point where it's--

02:26:17.652 --> 02:26:18.892
MARISHA: He's fucking old!

02:26:18.892 --> 02:26:20.286
He is fucking old.

02:26:20.286 --> 02:26:21.119
MATT: But not to the point

02:26:21.119 --> 02:26:22.602
where it's affecting its strength.

02:26:22.602 --> 02:26:25.952
If anything, its mass is quite intense,

02:26:25.952 --> 02:26:28.507
and it's quite angry, but there are--

02:26:28.507 --> 02:26:30.944
MARISHA: But he's one of those super beefy old guys

02:26:30.944 --> 02:26:33.332
that has a Bowflex,

02:26:33.332 --> 02:26:34.822
and is like, "Holy shit.

02:26:34.822 --> 02:26:36.222
"You're in your seventies?

02:26:36.222 --> 02:26:37.080
"Fuck, dude."

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:37.988
He's one of those guys.

02:26:37.988 --> 02:26:39.492
SAM: Used to be a Navy SEAL?
MATT: Old man T-Rex.

02:26:39.492 --> 02:26:40.835
MARISHA and MATT: Yeah.

02:26:41.922 --> 02:26:45.306
MATT: But no resistances and no vulnerabilities.

02:26:45.306 --> 02:26:48.892
MARISHA: Okay, I communicate that with what I just said.

02:26:48.892 --> 02:26:49.967
MATT: Is that your turn?
MARISHA: Yes.

02:26:49.967 --> 02:26:50.947
MATT: All right. Yasha, what are you doing?

02:26:50.947 --> 02:26:54.385
ASHLEY: Okay, as I'm running towards this big T-Rex

02:26:54.385 --> 02:26:55.802
I'm going into a rage.

02:26:55.802 --> 02:26:57.316
(cheering)

02:26:57.316 --> 02:26:58.299
MATT: We'll say that it's up now since

02:26:58.299 --> 02:27:00.202
you guys lost the element of surprise.

02:27:01.292 --> 02:27:02.962
ASHLEY: And let's go here.

02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:07.622
(vocalizing)

02:27:08.672 --> 02:27:09.505
Oops.

02:27:09.505 --> 02:27:10.982
Oh yeah.

02:27:10.982 --> 02:27:12.122
Okay.

02:27:12.122 --> 02:27:14.072
That would be...

02:27:15.842 --> 02:27:16.772
a 23.

02:27:16.772 --> 02:27:18.592
MATT: That hits.
ASHLEY: For the first hit.

02:27:18.592 --> 02:27:20.252
So let's--

02:27:20.252 --> 02:27:21.412
Man, I haven't done this in a while,

02:27:21.412 --> 02:27:22.922
because I've been rolling so shitty.

02:27:22.922 --> 02:27:24.546
MATT: I know.

02:27:24.546 --> 02:27:27.355
ASHLEY: That wasn't great, so I'm going to do--

02:27:27.355 --> 02:27:28.392
MATT: Savage Attacker?

02:27:28.392 --> 02:27:29.592
ASHLEY: Yeah, Savage Attacker.

02:27:32.732 --> 02:27:34.159
That's exactly the same.
TRAVIS: Warm it up.

02:27:34.159 --> 02:27:34.992
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:27:36.768 --> 02:27:38.508
16 for the first hit.

02:27:38.508 --> 02:27:40.425
MATT: 16 for the first hit.

02:27:41.322 --> 02:27:42.742
ASHLEY: Second attack...

02:27:46.032 --> 02:27:46.865
19?

02:27:46.865 --> 02:27:47.965
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:27:47.965 --> 02:27:49.098
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:51.373
Let's use these little tinies.

02:27:51.373 --> 02:27:52.206
Ooh!

02:27:55.692 --> 02:27:57.162
15 for the second hit.

02:27:57.162 --> 02:27:59.502
MATT: 15. You got it.

02:27:59.502 --> 02:28:01.852
Okay, that finishes your go.

02:28:01.852 --> 02:28:06.202
Next up is Caduceus with Veth on deck.

02:28:06.202 --> 02:28:07.962
TALIESIN: Ray of Enfeeblement.

02:28:07.962 --> 02:28:09.322
TRAVIS: Ooh.

02:28:09.322 --> 02:28:11.300
MATT: All righty. What's do I have to roll for that?

02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:13.058
TALIESIN: I have to roll. It's a spell attack.

02:28:13.058 --> 02:28:15.232
MATT: Oh, a spell attack? Go for it.

02:28:15.232 --> 02:28:16.829
TALIESIN: That's-- (laughs)

02:28:16.829 --> 02:28:18.352
That's a 28.

02:28:18.352 --> 02:28:19.185
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

02:28:19.185 --> 02:28:20.342
TALIESIN: So yeah.

02:28:20.342 --> 02:28:23.295
Half damage, half damage--

02:28:23.295 --> 02:28:24.798
MATT: Half damage for strength-based attacks, right?

02:28:24.798 --> 02:28:25.631
TALIESIN: Yeah, strength-based attacks.

02:28:25.631 --> 02:28:26.497
MATT: You got it.

02:28:26.497 --> 02:28:27.572
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to take cover.

02:28:27.572 --> 02:28:29.212
TRAVIS: Great call.

02:28:29.212 --> 02:28:31.582
TALIESIN: I'm going to take some cover.

02:28:31.582 --> 02:28:32.522
MATT: Okay.

02:28:32.522 --> 02:28:34.672
MARISHA: He does half damage on strength-based?

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:36.014
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Oh, that's dope.

02:28:36.014 --> 02:28:38.414
MATT: All right and you're running this way for cover?

02:28:38.414 --> 02:28:40.092
TALIESIN: Yeah, behind a tree.

02:28:40.092 --> 02:28:40.925
Yeah.

02:28:40.925 --> 02:28:42.792
MATT: This is the closest tree you find.

02:28:42.792 --> 02:28:44.072
Get you about there.

02:28:44.072 --> 02:28:46.227
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: With your movement at 30.

02:28:46.227 --> 02:28:47.252
You were running that way, and you're like,

02:28:47.252 --> 02:28:48.722
"Nope! This way."

02:28:49.650 --> 02:28:51.623
Ray of Enfeeblement out of your hand strikes it.

02:28:51.623 --> 02:28:53.048
You watch the creature as it gets up:

02:28:53.048 --> 02:28:54.750
(heavy steps, snarling)

02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:56.156
(crackling, grunt of pain)

02:28:56.156 --> 02:28:57.712
and you watch as its jaw muscles

02:28:57.712 --> 02:28:59.362
temporarily wither,

02:28:59.362 --> 02:29:01.652
and darken in the moment as the magic swirls around,

02:29:01.652 --> 02:29:03.282
and grasps the side of its throat.

02:29:03.282 --> 02:29:05.612
You see one of his legs buckles momentarily,

02:29:05.612 --> 02:29:09.650
and it's physically now enfeebled by the magic you've cast.

02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:11.530
That finishes your go, Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:29:11.530 --> 02:29:14.402
MATT: Veth, you're up with Jester on deck.

02:29:14.402 --> 02:29:16.002
SAM: All right.

02:29:16.002 --> 02:29:17.796
I will-- (cry of pain)

02:29:17.796 --> 02:29:19.013
I'll stand up.

02:29:19.013 --> 02:29:20.612
(grumbles)

02:29:20.612 --> 02:29:21.978
MATT: Yeah, all right. That's half your movement

02:29:21.978 --> 02:29:24.262
standing up from there.
SAM: Sorry!

02:29:24.262 --> 02:29:28.119
And I will, as a bonus action, cast

02:29:28.119 --> 02:29:30.512
Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt.

02:29:30.512 --> 02:29:32.302
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:29:32.302 --> 02:29:34.552
SAM: Activate a bolt,

02:29:34.552 --> 02:29:38.662
and then I will fire said bolt at the creature

02:29:38.662 --> 02:29:40.062
using Sharpshooter.

02:29:40.062 --> 02:29:40.895
MATT: Okay.

02:29:42.810 --> 02:29:45.192
SAM: 13 plus ten minus five.

02:29:45.192 --> 02:29:46.702
Right?

02:29:46.702 --> 02:29:47.762
18 to hit.

02:29:47.762 --> 02:29:49.212
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:29:49.212 --> 02:29:50.636
SAM: Okay. And it's engaged?

02:29:50.636 --> 02:29:51.469
MATT: Indeed it is.

02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:53.005
So you do get sneak attack damage.

02:29:56.702 --> 02:29:58.212
SAM and ASHLEY: Whoa.

02:29:58.212 --> 02:29:59.912
I'm going to reroll both of those.

02:30:01.302 --> 02:30:02.382
Okay.

02:30:02.382 --> 02:30:03.457
Lots of threes.

02:30:07.602 --> 02:30:11.362
20 plus 10 because I Sharpshootered.

02:30:11.362 --> 02:30:13.162
So that's 30 plus

02:30:15.632 --> 02:30:20.632
the Voltaic Bolt is another nine.

02:30:20.797 --> 02:30:25.349
39 plus one more thing.

02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:27.182
ASHLEY: Jeez louise.

02:30:27.182 --> 02:30:28.973
SAM: 45.
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:30:28.973 --> 02:30:31.062
MATT: 45, nice!
ASHLEY: Dang!

02:30:31.062 --> 02:30:32.532
MATT: All right, so as you get back up--

02:30:32.532 --> 02:30:33.469
(groaning)

02:30:33.469 --> 02:30:37.612
you aim your crossbow and fire right as its leg bends

02:30:37.612 --> 02:30:39.702
from the enfeeblement spell, and it buckles for a moment.

02:30:39.702 --> 02:30:41.922
As it does, its head flops downward

02:30:41.922 --> 02:30:42.952
exposing under the neck,

02:30:42.952 --> 02:30:44.269
and the bolt immediately

02:30:44.269 --> 02:30:46.132
(impact and pained inhale)

02:30:46.132 --> 02:30:48.694
and you see blood begin to pour out of the mouth.

02:30:48.694 --> 02:30:51.281
It was a nice, solid hit to a
very sensitive part of its throat.

02:30:51.281 --> 02:30:52.462
SAM: Yes!

02:30:52.462 --> 02:30:53.572
MATT: That finish your turn?

02:30:53.572 --> 02:30:55.042
SAM: Call me Ishmael.

02:30:55.042 --> 02:30:56.202
MATT: All right.

02:30:56.202 --> 02:30:58.502
You have 15 more feet of movement, if you'd like to move.

02:30:58.502 --> 02:30:59.932
SAM: I will...

02:31:01.090 --> 02:31:02.352
Nah, I'm good.

02:31:02.352 --> 02:31:03.185
MATT: Okay.

02:31:03.185 --> 02:31:06.232
Finishing that turn. That brings us to Jester.

02:31:06.232 --> 02:31:08.602
Caleb, you're on deck.

02:31:08.602 --> 02:31:11.312
LAURA: Okay. How tall is the creature?

02:31:11.312 --> 02:31:15.549
MATT: The creature is roughly 20 feet tall.

02:31:15.549 --> 02:31:17.720
LAURA: Okay.

02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:19.098
MATT: At its highest point.

02:31:19.098 --> 02:31:20.223
LAURA: Okay.

02:31:20.223 --> 02:31:23.775
I have a question about Blade Barrier--

02:31:23.775 --> 02:31:25.383
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: -- would I know?

02:31:26.452 --> 02:31:28.052
It's a wall that you create.

02:31:28.052 --> 02:31:30.702
Can I create it at any height?

02:31:30.702 --> 02:31:32.385
Can it be off of the ground,

02:31:33.382 --> 02:31:35.482
or does it have to be touching the ground?

02:31:36.322 --> 02:31:38.142
MATT: Blade Barrier?

02:31:38.142 --> 02:31:39.612
Let me double check here.

02:31:39.612 --> 02:31:40.462
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:31:40.462 --> 02:31:41.770
SAM: (imitates the intense music)

02:31:41.770 --> 02:31:43.160
TALIESIN: First in the campaign, if I recall.

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:46.104
LIAM: You know you're fighting
a T-Rex if there's electric guitar.

02:31:46.104 --> 02:31:47.942
ASHLEY: (imitates the intense music)

02:31:47.942 --> 02:31:50.705
TRAVIS: (pained roar)

02:31:50.705 --> 02:31:53.342
LIAM: (imitates a T-Rex playing an electric guitar)

02:31:53.342 --> 02:31:55.262
TALIESIN: Find it wearing shades.

02:31:55.262 --> 02:31:57.237
Up here. A keytar.

02:31:57.237 --> 02:32:00.412
MATT: Pardon me, as I have to go look it up on D&amp;D Beyond.

02:32:00.412 --> 02:32:02.440
MARISHA: Our T-Rex band.

02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:04.249
Yeah, it's just a keytar.

02:32:04.249 --> 02:32:05.082
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:32:06.486 --> 02:32:08.955
MATT: I don't think they can get--
TALIESIN: How-- it's--

02:32:08.955 --> 02:32:11.596
LIAM: Yeah, hands have to be real small.

02:32:11.596 --> 02:32:15.662
(laughter)

02:32:15.662 --> 02:32:16.912
MATT: "Within range...

02:32:16.912 --> 02:32:19.602
"Can make a straight wall up to a hundred feet long.

02:32:19.602 --> 02:32:20.812
"It is a wall of whirling blades."

02:32:20.812 --> 02:32:21.799
I could say...

02:32:26.382 --> 02:32:29.342
since it is whirling blades, I'll allow it to

02:32:29.342 --> 02:32:30.462
be at any height.
LAURA: Be at any height.

02:32:30.462 --> 02:32:31.366
MATT: Yeah, sure.
LAURA: Okay, cool.

02:32:31.366 --> 02:32:33.792
Then I'm going to make it 15 feet off the ground.

02:32:33.792 --> 02:32:35.305
So it doesn't hit any of us,

02:32:36.584 --> 02:32:38.772
and I'm going to make it a circle

02:32:38.772 --> 02:32:42.602
around the dinosaur.

02:32:43.652 --> 02:32:45.381
TALIESIN: This is so...
LIAM: [inaudible]

02:32:45.381 --> 02:32:47.772
TALIESIN: This is just so Jurassic Park.

02:32:47.772 --> 02:32:49.032
ASHLEY: I love it.

02:32:49.032 --> 02:32:50.832
TALIESIN: Can't get through the electric fence.
TRAVIS: I'm so happy.

02:32:50.832 --> 02:32:53.515
LAURA: It can be 60 feet in diameter,

02:32:54.652 --> 02:32:58.742
so I'll probably make it, you know, 40 feet in diameter.

02:32:58.742 --> 02:32:59.982
MATT: Right. So the--

02:33:03.152 --> 02:33:03.985
LAURA: I would like it to--

02:33:03.985 --> 02:33:05.412
MATT: It's still a ringed wall.

02:33:05.412 --> 02:33:07.990
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe... Yeah.

02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:09.582
MATT: So you're just lifting it up in the air.

02:33:09.582 --> 02:33:10.657
LAURA: Yeah. Lifting it up in the air,

02:33:10.657 --> 02:33:13.022
but I'm going to make it to where it's like a ring

02:33:13.022 --> 02:33:14.622
that's touching him right now,

02:33:14.622 --> 02:33:15.672
so that when he starts it

02:33:15.672 --> 02:33:17.702
it's going to hit him.
MATT: Got it.

02:33:17.702 --> 02:33:19.019
It's a little larger than this,

02:33:19.019 --> 02:33:21.322
but I'm setting this here as an example.

02:33:21.322 --> 02:33:23.542
So we know where it is.

02:33:23.542 --> 02:33:24.469
It's actually bigger than this.

02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:25.485
LAURA: Cool.

02:33:25.485 --> 02:33:27.025
MATT: It's as large as... Okay.

02:33:27.025 --> 02:33:27.875
LAURA: It's only four--

02:33:27.875 --> 02:33:30.842
I said only 40 feet instead of 60 feet, so.

02:33:30.842 --> 02:33:32.342
MATT: That's fine.
LAURA: Okay.

02:33:34.422 --> 02:33:35.895
MATT: 40 feet in diameter actually would be that.

02:33:35.895 --> 02:33:38.312
It's 60 feet in diameter, technically.

02:33:38.312 --> 02:33:40.279
If you want to make it smaller--
LAURA: You can make it smaller if you want, yeah.

02:33:40.279 --> 02:33:43.212
MATT: Okay, cool. So at the start of its turn.

02:33:43.212 --> 02:33:44.994
LAURA: Or yeah, when it enters there for the first time.

02:33:44.994 --> 02:33:47.102
MATT: Got it. So we'll get to that
when we come around to it.

02:33:47.102 --> 02:33:49.862
LIAM: Apologies. That's where the ring
is on the front half of...

02:33:49.862 --> 02:33:50.695
MATT: Correct, up in the air.

02:33:50.695 --> 02:33:53.392
You watch as Jester takes one hand,

02:33:53.392 --> 02:33:54.986
and swirls it up, holding

02:33:54.986 --> 02:33:57.622
whatever your holy symbol is currently.

02:33:57.622 --> 02:33:58.455
If you're not holding a dick,

02:33:58.455 --> 02:34:00.162
or you're holding your classic Jester one.

02:34:00.162 --> 02:34:01.258
LAURA: It's my Traveler symbol.

02:34:01.258 --> 02:34:03.132
MATT: Okay. So you're holding the Traveler symbol there.

02:34:03.132 --> 02:34:05.012
As you do, you watch it up in the air.

02:34:05.012 --> 02:34:08.022
The faint bit of moisture coalesces

02:34:08.022 --> 02:34:09.833
into these small wind blades that

02:34:09.833 --> 02:34:11.064
(slicing wind)

02:34:11.064 --> 02:34:14.562
And you watch as this large, semi-ethereal

02:34:15.482 --> 02:34:18.062
thickened mass of magical blades.

02:34:18.062 --> 02:34:20.302
Just this horrible crushing,

02:34:20.302 --> 02:34:22.952
winding arcane trap,

02:34:22.952 --> 02:34:24.312
you would imagine to see of hundreds

02:34:24.312 --> 02:34:26.402
and hundreds of these tiny spinning blades,

02:34:26.402 --> 02:34:28.242
just slightly rotating in the air,

02:34:28.242 --> 02:34:29.552
above this creature.

02:34:29.552 --> 02:34:31.492
And you watch as they begin to carve into the side of it

02:34:31.492 --> 02:34:33.522
as it's starting to stand up,

02:34:33.522 --> 02:34:34.592
and get ready for its round--

02:34:34.592 --> 02:34:35.732
(grinding and shredding)

02:34:35.732 --> 02:34:37.222
cutting into its body.

02:34:37.222 --> 02:34:39.362
Do you want to move or stay put?

02:34:39.362 --> 02:34:41.802
LAURA: I'll move behind the trunk right there.

02:34:41.802 --> 02:34:44.802
TRAVIS: We're preserving its meat very well.

02:34:44.802 --> 02:34:45.635
MATT: You've got it.

02:34:45.635 --> 02:34:46.842
SAM: Speaking of...
MARISHA: Just hacking into it.

02:34:46.842 --> 02:34:48.012
TRAVIS: Skilled hunter.

02:34:48.012 --> 02:34:49.732
SAM: After we kill it,

02:34:49.732 --> 02:34:51.301
how do we get it back?

02:34:51.301 --> 02:34:53.348
LAURA: We don't know yet. We'll figure it out.

02:34:53.348 --> 02:34:55.116
LIAM: Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

02:34:55.116 --> 02:34:57.351
TRAVIS: Right before we started, I was like--
MATT: Caleb, your turn.

02:34:57.351 --> 02:34:58.276
Fjord, you're up on deck.

02:34:58.276 --> 02:35:00.910
LIAM: Okay. So it's my echo and me.

02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:04.632
The echo first will silently pull his hands apart,

02:35:04.632 --> 02:35:07.182
and a Fireball starts to form in the echo's hands,

02:35:07.182 --> 02:35:09.582
and he hucks it into the air.

02:35:09.582 --> 02:35:10.712
30 feet into the air,

02:35:10.712 --> 02:35:12.562
so that it's 20-foot diameter

02:35:12.562 --> 02:35:16.188
hits just the top of our dinosaur friend and nobody else.

02:35:16.188 --> 02:35:17.813
SAM: This is a ball of fire?
MATT: Explodes.

02:35:17.813 --> 02:35:18.929
LIAM: Fireball.

02:35:18.929 --> 02:35:20.862
MATT: Dexterity check.
MARISHA: There is going to be no T-Rex left.

02:35:20.862 --> 02:35:21.893
SAM: Nope!

02:35:21.893 --> 02:35:24.337
MATT: That is a fail on its dex save.
So full damage on that.

02:35:24.337 --> 02:35:25.920
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: We brought you--

02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:28.144
TALIESIN: Pre-cooked.
SAM: -- a backbone.

02:35:28.144 --> 02:35:28.986
And some feet.

02:35:28.986 --> 02:35:30.119
TRAVIS: The bone marrow.

02:35:30.119 --> 02:35:31.425
LIAM: 34.

02:35:31.425 --> 02:35:34.742
MATT: Okay. The Resonant Echo
vanishes with the spell expended.

02:35:34.742 --> 02:35:36.472
MARISHA: It's a Looney Tunes cartoon.

02:35:36.472 --> 02:35:38.262
Just whatever was left.

02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:42.698
LIAM: And then Caleb turns into a T-Rex.

02:35:43.942 --> 02:35:47.642
A Bengal cat mottled T-Rex.

02:35:47.642 --> 02:35:49.468
MARISHA: Oh, he's so cute!

02:35:49.468 --> 02:35:52.618
MATT: I don't have a T-Rex additionally to add to the board,

02:35:52.618 --> 02:35:54.462
so you're just going to get a shitty alligator.

02:35:54.462 --> 02:35:55.297
LIAM: I love it.

02:35:55.297 --> 02:35:58.551
(laughter)

02:35:58.551 --> 02:36:00.353
TRAVIS: Oh man.
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

02:36:00.353 --> 02:36:01.452
MATT: There you go.

02:36:01.452 --> 02:36:04.952
You are a Bengal cat T-Rex alligator.

02:36:04.952 --> 02:36:06.335
TRAVIS: Fuck.
ASHLEY: Mrrow!

02:36:06.335 --> 02:36:07.419
MATT: But indeed you have seen a T-Rex,

02:36:07.419 --> 02:36:09.332
so you can transform into one without an issue.

02:36:09.332 --> 02:36:10.799
LIAM: He has some movement, right?

02:36:10.799 --> 02:36:11.632
MATT: Yes.

02:36:11.632 --> 02:36:14.078
LIAM: Yeah. So I will run towards the ass of our opponent.

02:36:14.078 --> 02:36:14.911
MATT: A speed of 50 feet.

02:36:14.911 --> 02:36:16.327
So you can definitely (thudding).

02:36:16.327 --> 02:36:18.461
LAURA: Anything that enters the Blade Barrier

02:36:18.461 --> 02:36:19.452
will get hit.
LIAM: And the blades are on the on the front.

02:36:19.452 --> 02:36:20.702
That's why I asked...
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36:20.702 --> 02:36:22.292
LIAM: It's in the front half of our friend.

02:36:22.292 --> 02:36:24.572
MATT: So you have not quite reached

02:36:24.572 --> 02:36:25.405
the edge of the Blade Barrier

02:36:25.405 --> 02:36:26.391
as the blades are now--

02:36:26.391 --> 02:36:27.224
(revving)

02:36:27.224 --> 02:36:28.772
this loud, high pitched,

02:36:28.772 --> 02:36:33.767
screeching, grinding sound of thousands of arcane blades

02:36:33.767 --> 02:36:35.092
like colliding with each other.

02:36:35.092 --> 02:36:40.051
You watch as this giant Bengal tiger-patterned T-Rex comes

02:36:40.051 --> 02:36:43.432
(stomping and roaring)

02:36:43.432 --> 02:36:45.412
up to the other T-Rex, who at this point

02:36:45.412 --> 02:36:47.242
is reeling from the blades.

02:36:47.242 --> 02:36:49.589
His head spins around and goes (roar)

02:36:49.589 --> 02:36:52.789
towards the now arriving,

02:36:52.789 --> 02:36:55.692
unexpected creature.

02:36:55.692 --> 02:36:57.958
All right. That finishes your turn, Caleb.

02:36:57.958 --> 02:37:01.342
All right. Fjord, you're up.

02:37:01.342 --> 02:37:02.652
TRAVIS: I summon the sword

02:37:02.652 --> 02:37:05.812
and prepare to charge in before a

02:37:05.812 --> 02:37:09.332
fucking Bengal tiger-shaped T-Rex runs into the fray,

02:37:09.332 --> 02:37:13.155
and I'm like: Nah, I'm good.

02:37:13.155 --> 02:37:17.224
I'll cast Eldritch Blast from way back here.

02:37:17.224 --> 02:37:19.734
(laughter)

02:37:19.734 --> 02:37:21.437
I'll stay out.

02:37:24.052 --> 02:37:26.519
The first one is a 23 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

02:37:26.519 --> 02:37:29.322
TRAVIS: There's three of these I've learned, thank you.

02:37:29.322 --> 02:37:30.502
That's a 19 to hit.

02:37:30.502 --> 02:37:31.335
MATT: That hits.

02:37:32.682 --> 02:37:34.145
TRAVIS: And that's cocked,

02:37:35.292 --> 02:37:36.982
and 18 to hit.

02:37:36.982 --> 02:37:37.815
MATT: Three hit.

02:37:37.815 --> 02:37:39.072
TRAVIS: All right.

02:37:39.072 --> 02:37:40.912
TALIESIN: Like walking up to the girl
at the high school dance.

02:37:40.912 --> 02:37:41.962
Like: Ah, no.

02:37:41.962 --> 02:37:42.795
TRAVIS: Yeah...

02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:47.408
MARISHA: As the quarterback comes up and kisses her.

02:37:48.453 --> 02:37:50.622
SAM: I was just getting punch.

02:37:50.622 --> 02:37:52.692
TRAVIS: 32 points of force damage.

02:37:52.692 --> 02:37:53.525
MATT: Nice.

02:37:53.525 --> 02:37:54.779
TALIESIN: Back to the sandwich plate.

02:37:54.779 --> 02:37:56.972
TRAVIS: And I should have done this first,
but I will use my bonus action to--

02:37:56.972 --> 02:37:58.952
no, I don't need to do Hexblade's Curse.

02:37:58.952 --> 02:38:01.938
There's a fucking T-Rex in there. We're okay.

02:38:01.938 --> 02:38:02.909
MATT: You going to move, or stay put?

02:38:02.909 --> 02:38:06.329
TRAVIS: I'm going to actually step back ten feet.

02:38:07.862 --> 02:38:10.230
Like--
MATT: (blasting)

02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:13.245
Perfect. All right. Finishing your go,
back to the top of the round.

02:38:13.245 --> 02:38:14.078
Beauregard, you're up.

02:38:14.078 --> 02:38:16.594
MARISHA: Oh shit. It's me.

02:38:16.594 --> 02:38:18.564
MATT: This creature is looking hurt.

02:38:18.564 --> 02:38:22.106
(laughter)

02:38:22.106 --> 02:38:24.356
SAM: Poor guy.
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

02:38:24.356 --> 02:38:26.012
LAURA: Now I feel bad for it.

02:38:26.012 --> 02:38:28.511
ASHLEY: Me, too. He was sleeping.

02:38:28.511 --> 02:38:30.185
MARISHA: Sleepy boy.
ASHLEY: He was asleep.

02:38:30.185 --> 02:38:31.997
TALIESIN: Covered in the blood of the creature.

02:38:31.997 --> 02:38:33.071
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:38:33.071 --> 02:38:34.652
TALIESIN: Keeping him warm.

02:38:34.652 --> 02:38:36.922
MARISHA: I'm right by his meaty legs.

02:38:36.922 --> 02:38:39.444
I'm going to go for the Achilles tendon.

02:38:39.444 --> 02:38:40.745
MATT: Go for it.

02:38:40.745 --> 02:38:42.729
Whack whack. Right to the back of his leg.

02:38:42.729 --> 02:38:45.012
TRAVIS: (like the T-Rex) Why?
MARISHA: Pop pop!

02:38:45.012 --> 02:38:46.041
TRAVIS: (like the T-Rex) Why?

02:38:46.041 --> 02:38:48.455
SAM: (like the T-Rex) I've done nothing wrong!

02:38:48.455 --> 02:38:49.532
TRAVIS: (like the T-Rex) I was so old!

02:38:49.532 --> 02:38:52.107
(laughter)

02:38:52.107 --> 02:38:53.529
MARISHA: 27 and 30 to hit.

02:38:53.529 --> 02:38:55.080
MATT: Yeah. They-- They hit.

02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:56.652
MARISHA: Okay.

02:38:56.652 --> 02:38:58.318
Wait. Those aren't right. Those aren't--

02:38:58.318 --> 02:38:59.862
Or, wait.

02:38:59.862 --> 02:39:01.682
Oh yeah. Staff's are d8.

02:39:01.682 --> 02:39:02.515
No, okay.

02:39:02.515 --> 02:39:05.402
I am doing this right. I am doing this right. Okay.

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:06.240
Sorry. New staff.

02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:07.073
TALIESIN: New toys.

02:39:08.692 --> 02:39:09.525
MARISHA: Okay.

02:39:11.292 --> 02:39:12.922
Oh, these are both the same,

02:39:12.922 --> 02:39:14.292
which is 14.

02:39:14.292 --> 02:39:16.289
14 and 14.

02:39:16.289 --> 02:39:17.902
MATT: 14 and 14 damage?

02:39:17.902 --> 02:39:18.904
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

02:39:18.904 --> 02:39:21.259
MARISHA: So 28.

02:39:21.259 --> 02:39:22.342
MATT: You got it.

02:39:23.565 --> 02:39:24.881
You guys are rolling pretty damn good on this.

02:39:24.881 --> 02:39:25.942
MARISHA: And--

02:39:25.942 --> 02:39:28.058
SAM: Confidently, Matt.

02:39:28.058 --> 02:39:31.052
MARISHA: It's why I went into a creative field.

02:39:31.052 --> 02:39:34.568
I will Flurry of Blows.

02:39:34.568 --> 02:39:37.419
MATT: Go for it. Two more strikes.
MARISHA: Pop pop.

02:39:37.419 --> 02:39:38.386
SAM: Pop, pop.

02:39:38.386 --> 02:39:39.369
MARISHA: Oof, Oof.

02:39:39.369 --> 02:39:40.862
Oh, one might not hit.

02:39:40.862 --> 02:39:42.862
22 for one.

02:39:42.862 --> 02:39:46.162
And that's a three for 15.

02:39:46.162 --> 02:39:47.719
MATT: 15 still hits.
SAM: Oh boy.

02:39:47.719 --> 02:39:49.822
MATT and TALIESIN: It's a big guy.

02:39:49.822 --> 02:39:53.492
MATT: It's got a thicker hide, but not terribly.

02:39:53.492 --> 02:39:56.442
MARISHA: Okay. So that's 12.

02:39:56.442 --> 02:39:58.582
And...

02:39:58.582 --> 02:39:59.921
13.

02:39:59.921 --> 02:40:01.282
MATT: Okay.

02:40:01.282 --> 02:40:04.063
SAM: Just then, three baby T-Rexes come back--

02:40:04.063 --> 02:40:06.760
TRAVIS: Daddy?
SAM: -- from a slumber party.

02:40:07.692 --> 02:40:08.534
Papa?

02:40:08.534 --> 02:40:09.730
TRAVIS: Run, kids!

02:40:09.730 --> 02:40:12.128
(screams in agony)

02:40:12.128 --> 02:40:14.295
MATT: (like the T-Rex) "This island is terrible!"

02:40:15.632 --> 02:40:18.087
MARISHA: But then we'd get T-Rex mounts!

02:40:19.122 --> 02:40:20.582
MATT: All right. So that finishes your turn.

02:40:20.582 --> 02:40:22.796
Are you going to say put, or are you going to move?

02:40:22.796 --> 02:40:23.738
MARISHA: I'm going to stay here.

02:40:23.738 --> 02:40:25.622
MATT: Okay. Yasha.

02:40:25.622 --> 02:40:26.455
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:40:26.455 --> 02:40:28.262
MATT: Actually, what is your dexterity?

02:40:28.262 --> 02:40:30.892
ASHLEY: My dexterity is 15.

02:40:30.892 --> 02:40:33.258
MATT: Yes. You go.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:40:33.258 --> 02:40:36.005
MATT: You guys are actually on the
same initiative as the T-Rex.

02:40:37.002 --> 02:40:38.693
ASHLEY: Oh, wow. Okay.

02:40:40.422 --> 02:40:41.255
That hits.

02:40:41.255 --> 02:40:42.662
That is a 23.

02:40:42.662 --> 02:40:43.495
MATT: That hits.

02:40:43.495 --> 02:40:45.340
ASHLEY: Okay. So...

02:40:48.837 --> 02:40:50.670
LAURA: (sings with background music)

02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:51.861
ASHLEY: Savage Attacker.

02:40:51.861 --> 02:40:55.319
SAM and LIAM: (sing with background music)

02:40:55.319 --> 02:40:56.480
ASHLEY: Okay...

02:40:59.612 --> 02:41:01.186
20 for the first hit.

02:41:01.186 --> 02:41:03.282
MATT: Nice.
MARISHA: I think I need glasses.

02:41:03.282 --> 02:41:04.515
ASHLEY: Second hit.

02:41:05.797 --> 02:41:06.712
MARISHA: What's the bottom say?

02:41:06.712 --> 02:41:09.191
SAM: It says, "We love to fly, and it Beaus!"

02:41:09.191 --> 02:41:11.173
ASHLEY: 15. 15 hits?
MATT: 15 hits.

02:41:11.173 --> 02:41:13.323
ASHLEY: Okay. Second attack.

02:41:18.583 --> 02:41:20.372
TRAVIS: Applause.

02:41:20.372 --> 02:41:21.750
ASHLEY: 15...

02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:23.216
MATT: 15 damage?
ASHLEY: 15 damage.

02:41:23.216 --> 02:41:24.592
MATT: Great.

02:41:24.592 --> 02:41:27.112
So after Beau pummels the bottom side

02:41:27.112 --> 02:41:31.592
of its ankle with the staff,

02:41:31.592 --> 02:41:33.402
and then a couple of kicks, and a punch to the side,

02:41:33.402 --> 02:41:34.382
looking underneath the leg,

02:41:34.382 --> 02:41:35.972
across making eye contact with you,

02:41:35.972 --> 02:41:37.350
you come up with two heavy swings.

02:41:37.350 --> 02:41:38.762
(whooshing)

02:41:38.762 --> 02:41:40.332
And as you cut you can see the blood spray

02:41:40.332 --> 02:41:41.432
(splattering)

02:41:41.432 --> 02:41:44.422
against the rock and nearby vegetation.

02:41:44.422 --> 02:41:45.519
And both of its legs like--

02:41:45.519 --> 02:41:46.782
(pained groaning)

02:41:46.782 --> 02:41:48.062
Now it's its turn.

02:41:48.062 --> 02:41:49.642
Angrily.

02:41:49.642 --> 02:41:50.942
After you do the hits, Beauregard,

02:41:50.942 --> 02:41:53.325
you look up and you see its head.

02:41:53.325 --> 02:41:57.498
First, it takes-- is it 6d10?

02:41:57.498 --> 02:41:58.854
LAURA: Yes. 6d10 damage.

02:41:58.854 --> 02:42:00.212
TRAVIS: 6d10?

02:42:00.212 --> 02:42:01.536
MATT: So go ahead and roll that.

02:42:01.536 --> 02:42:03.202
LIAM: 30 damage. Ish.

02:42:03.202 --> 02:42:05.082
MARISHA: It looks at me and dies.

02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:05.915
That's what happens.

02:42:05.915 --> 02:42:07.779
SAM: Maybe it's a T-Rex mage.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:42:07.779 --> 02:42:10.047
SAM: Maybe we're waiting for something bad.

02:42:10.047 --> 02:42:12.380
LIAM: (whooshing)

02:42:13.238 --> 02:42:15.697
MARISHA: Meteor Swarm?
TALIESIN: 30 point average, right there.

02:42:15.697 --> 02:42:16.530
LIAM: (puff of wind)

02:42:17.762 --> 02:42:19.292
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:42:19.292 --> 02:42:21.742
MATT: Burning Hands. (splutter)

02:42:21.742 --> 02:42:23.142
Only really reaches one of you.

02:42:23.142 --> 02:42:26.265
LAURA: 34 points of--
MATT: 34 points of slashing damage.

02:42:26.265 --> 02:42:28.427
Nice. It goes (grinding sound),

02:42:28.427 --> 02:42:29.372
grinding up into it.

02:42:29.372 --> 02:42:31.730
It pulls back a bit and looks down towards its ankle,

02:42:31.730 --> 02:42:33.142
where it's been taking the impacts.

02:42:33.142 --> 02:42:35.090
And Beau, as you look up you see its head--

02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:36.715
(swoosh)

02:42:37.856 --> 02:42:38.692
(roar)

02:42:38.692 --> 02:42:40.932
As its head lunges down towards you.

02:42:40.932 --> 02:42:42.032
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:42:42.032 --> 02:42:43.418
Yeah.

02:42:43.418 --> 02:42:45.017
MARISHA: It's going to be great.
TRAVIS: What? Say it.

02:42:45.017 --> 02:42:45.850
MARISHA: Is it bad?

02:42:45.850 --> 02:42:48.333
MATT: It's a natural 20.
(groaning)

02:42:48.333 --> 02:42:50.312
TALIESIN: Am I within 30 feet of Beau?

02:42:50.312 --> 02:42:51.145
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:42:51.145 --> 02:42:51.978
TALIESIN: Cancel.

02:42:51.978 --> 02:42:54.135
SAM, TRAVIS, and ASHLEY: (groan)

02:42:54.135 --> 02:42:56.282
SAM: I kind of wanted it to--

02:42:56.282 --> 02:42:58.412
TRAVIS: What if it did something cool?

02:42:58.412 --> 02:43:00.992
MATT: All it would have done was
made it do its regular damage,

02:43:00.992 --> 02:43:02.632
because of the Ray of Enfeeblement.

02:43:02.632 --> 02:43:04.492
But now it does half damage.

02:43:04.492 --> 02:43:06.072
Man, well played.

02:43:06.072 --> 02:43:09.342
(laughter)

02:43:09.342 --> 02:43:11.982
MATT: I was so excited I actually rolled a 20.
ALL: Aww.

02:43:11.982 --> 02:43:13.714
MATT: No, don't be-- it's fine. It's fine.

02:43:13.714 --> 02:43:15.297
You're playing your character well.

02:43:15.297 --> 02:43:17.171
TALIESIN: That was a sarcastic "Aw." It's all good.
MATT: I know. I figured.

02:43:17.171 --> 02:43:19.202
(laughter)

02:43:19.202 --> 02:43:22.112
MATT: I can be proud and hurt at the same time.

02:43:22.112 --> 02:43:24.412
Well, nevertheless.
TRAVIS: (like T-Rex) Yay! Aw.

02:43:25.602 --> 02:43:28.122
MATT: So as it bears down on you,

02:43:28.122 --> 02:43:30.262
you try and duck out of the way.

02:43:30.262 --> 02:43:33.362
And as its jaws close around you,

02:43:33.362 --> 02:43:35.442
you feel this strange moment as

02:43:35.442 --> 02:43:38.792
the vegetation around you tugs you slightly out of the way,

02:43:38.792 --> 02:43:41.412
and you only get a mild series

02:43:41.412 --> 02:43:43.626
of crushing tooth abrasions to your body.

02:43:43.626 --> 02:43:44.526
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:43:44.526 --> 02:43:46.732
TALIESIN: It's like a massage.

02:43:46.732 --> 02:43:47.572
MARISHA: Ooh. It tingles.

02:43:47.572 --> 02:43:49.615
MATT: I got to get my twelves here.
TRAVIS: Fuck 'em up, T-Rex.

02:43:49.615 --> 02:43:51.315
LAURA: I wonder what the--

02:43:51.315 --> 02:43:53.592
I want to know what the critical would have been.

02:43:53.592 --> 02:43:55.692
TALIESIN: We'll find out. It's going to be...

02:43:57.452 --> 02:43:59.302
MARISHA: I need a dope scar.

02:43:59.302 --> 02:44:00.202
TALIESIN: It's going to be double this,

02:44:00.202 --> 02:44:01.742
and then double again would have been the critical.

02:44:01.742 --> 02:44:03.210
LAURA: Yeah.

02:44:03.210 --> 02:44:06.269
ASHLEY: We all need to take a tooth for a necklace.
TALIESIN: Or just double this.

02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:08.569
MARISHA: Yeah! Oh, magic necklace.

02:44:09.432 --> 02:44:12.115
MATT: You take...

02:44:12.115 --> 02:44:15.390
34 points of piercing damage.

02:44:15.390 --> 02:44:16.272
LAURA: That's halved?

02:44:16.272 --> 02:44:17.922
MATT: Yes.

02:44:17.922 --> 02:44:20.532
LAURA: Wait, 34... 68...

02:44:20.532 --> 02:44:21.619
It would have been a hundred,

02:44:21.619 --> 02:44:23.612
a hundred and something, DM?

02:44:23.612 --> 02:44:24.445
MATT: Yeah.

02:44:25.332 --> 02:44:26.262
It would have brought you to zero immediately

02:44:26.262 --> 02:44:30.097
with that crit, if that hadn't gotten there with the cancel.

02:44:30.097 --> 02:44:31.467
Thank your clerics.

02:44:32.432 --> 02:44:33.265
ASHLEY: Oh!

02:44:33.265 --> 02:44:35.032
MARISHA: Everyone, tip your clerics.
TRAVIS: We were fucking around.

02:44:35.032 --> 02:44:36.911
MARISHA: What did you say? 38?

02:44:36.911 --> 02:44:38.681
LAURA: 34.
MARISHA: 34.

02:44:38.681 --> 02:44:39.514
MATT: Points of piercing damage.

02:44:39.514 --> 02:44:41.152
SAM: So with no enfeeblement and no cancel,

02:44:41.152 --> 02:44:43.745
it would have been 136?

02:44:43.745 --> 02:44:45.218
MARISHA: Yeah. Is it double dice--

02:44:45.218 --> 02:44:46.522
Is it minus minus?

02:44:46.522 --> 02:44:47.947
Or is it just one half?

02:44:47.947 --> 02:44:49.352
TALIESIN: It would have been doubled,

02:44:49.352 --> 02:44:51.010
instead we brought it to single, and then it's halved.

02:44:51.010 --> 02:44:52.517
MATT: And it's halved because of the Ray of Enfeeblement.

02:44:52.517 --> 02:44:53.982
MARISHA: Wow.

02:44:53.982 --> 02:44:55.173
SAM: Nice.
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:44:55.173 --> 02:44:56.631
MARISHA: Wow.

02:44:56.631 --> 02:44:58.392
Respect.

02:44:58.392 --> 02:44:59.225
LIAM: I only asked,

02:44:59.225 --> 02:45:01.062
because I'm looking at T-Rex stats.

02:45:01.062 --> 02:45:02.392
MATT: Oh, this is not a normal T-Rex.

02:45:02.392 --> 02:45:03.225
LIAM: Right. Oh, okay.

02:45:03.225 --> 02:45:04.733
MARISHA: It's an Indo Rex.

02:45:04.733 --> 02:45:07.892
LIAM: Well, I grab-- if I bite and it's a small,

02:45:07.892 --> 02:45:09.742
that enemy is grappled.

02:45:09.742 --> 02:45:11.819
MATT: Yes, which is what I'm about to get to.

02:45:11.819 --> 02:45:12.962
You are grappled and restrained,

02:45:12.962 --> 02:45:14.092
because it--

02:45:14.092 --> 02:45:15.212
You took the damage,

02:45:15.212 --> 02:45:16.782
and it still has you in its mouth.

02:45:16.782 --> 02:45:18.042
And you're, like, full on,

02:45:18.042 --> 02:45:19.662
like we're talking, you know,

02:45:19.662 --> 02:45:21.842
off the toilet in Jurassic Park.

02:45:21.842 --> 02:45:23.572
You are just being crunched,

02:45:23.572 --> 02:45:24.432
and lifted in the air.

02:45:24.432 --> 02:45:25.946
You guys watch his Beau's legs are just--

02:45:25.946 --> 02:45:27.077
(swooshing)

02:45:27.077 --> 02:45:28.852
flailing about.

02:45:28.852 --> 02:45:30.996
This muffled scream from the inside.

02:45:30.996 --> 02:45:33.651
TRAVIS: Whoa! Whoa!

02:45:33.651 --> 02:45:35.107
Whoa!

02:45:35.107 --> 02:45:38.849
MARISHA: I just say: Yasha! Yasha! Are you watching?

02:45:38.849 --> 02:45:40.262
LIAM: (muffled) Yasha, Yasha.

02:45:40.262 --> 02:45:41.852
Are you watching?

02:45:41.852 --> 02:45:43.822
ASHLEY: Clever girl.

02:45:43.822 --> 02:45:46.092
MATT: And as it swings around with Beau in its mouth,

02:45:46.092 --> 02:45:49.942
its tail (heavy swoosh) swings back towards you, Yasha.

02:45:49.942 --> 02:45:51.654
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:45:51.654 --> 02:45:52.762
LAURA: Oh no.

02:45:53.602 --> 02:45:56.082
MATT: That is going to be a 22 to hit.

02:45:56.082 --> 02:45:57.232
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

02:45:57.232 --> 02:45:58.756
MATT: So you, like-- you see this happening,

02:45:58.756 --> 02:46:01.649
and all of a sudden you look to the side as-- (whump)

02:46:01.649 --> 02:46:03.606
You just get broadsided by its tail.

02:46:03.606 --> 02:46:06.281
TRAVIS: Yes. Yes. Yes.

02:46:07.672 --> 02:46:08.752
TALIESIN: Half damage.

02:46:08.752 --> 02:46:10.173
MARISHA: Holy shit.

02:46:19.292 --> 02:46:21.222
MATT: So it's 33 points of bludgeoning damage,

02:46:21.222 --> 02:46:22.681
reduced by half because of that.

02:46:22.681 --> 02:46:25.292
So it brings it to a 16 reduced by half,

02:46:25.292 --> 02:46:27.142
because of your rage brings it to eight.

02:46:27.142 --> 02:46:28.272
You take eight points of bludgeoning damage.

02:46:28.272 --> 02:46:30.435
LAURA: Oh my god. Wow.
TRAVIS: Fucking barbarians, man.

02:46:30.435 --> 02:46:31.418
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:46:31.418 --> 02:46:33.642
MARISHA: This is the coolest fight.

02:46:33.642 --> 02:46:35.002
MATT: So it hits you,

02:46:35.002 --> 02:46:36.432
and you actually duck down a bit,

02:46:36.432 --> 02:46:38.832
and your shoulder and back essentially

02:46:38.832 --> 02:46:40.648
helps it glide off you.

02:46:40.648 --> 02:46:43.152
Your hair gets pushed to the side from the blow of

02:46:43.152 --> 02:46:45.402
the impact and it hurts,

02:46:45.402 --> 02:46:47.092
but you keep yourself on the ground there.

02:46:47.092 --> 02:46:49.452
You took the full impact for a moment,

02:46:49.452 --> 02:46:51.912
and just let it slide off the side.

02:46:51.912 --> 02:46:53.920
Somewhere a duck barbarian would be proud.

02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:55.952
ASHLEY: Yeah!

02:46:55.952 --> 02:46:59.312
MATT: End of its turn, it's going to go ahead and...

02:47:00.322 --> 02:47:02.140
Huh, okay.

02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:04.832
It's another natural 20 to save against your spell.

02:47:04.832 --> 02:47:07.723
So it is no longer Enfeebled.

02:47:07.723 --> 02:47:08.574
LAURA: Oh no.

02:47:08.574 --> 02:47:09.602
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:47:09.602 --> 02:47:10.435
MATT: However..

02:47:10.435 --> 02:47:11.950
TRAVIS: There's just one monk in its mouth.

02:47:11.950 --> 02:47:13.752
No big deal.

02:47:13.752 --> 02:47:16.952
MATT: It's stuck in this Blade Barrier and surrounded,

02:47:16.952 --> 02:47:18.942
but you guys both have...

02:47:18.942 --> 02:47:20.692
It's not smart enough to know that.

02:47:20.692 --> 02:47:21.525
It's going to go ahead,

02:47:21.525 --> 02:47:24.661
and try and move out of the battle area here.

02:47:24.661 --> 02:47:25.494
TRAVIS: Kids!

02:47:25.494 --> 02:47:26.822
MARISHA: Help.

02:47:26.822 --> 02:47:28.363
MATT: So it's going to shift around here

02:47:28.363 --> 02:47:29.679
and head towards Caduceus.
LAURA and MARISHA: Sentinel!

02:47:29.679 --> 02:47:31.036
MARISHA: Sentinel bitches.

02:47:31.036 --> 02:47:32.578
Sentinel.
MATT: Both of you guys get

02:47:32.578 --> 02:47:33.933
attacks of opportunity on it.
MARISHA: Girlfriend!

02:47:33.933 --> 02:47:35.870
LIAM: So do I!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:37.612
MATT: It hasn't left your melee range yet.

02:47:37.612 --> 02:47:38.561
LIAM: Okay.

02:47:38.561 --> 02:47:39.677
ASHLEY: (whispered) Yes!

02:47:41.783 --> 02:47:42.703
ASHLEY: 21.

02:47:42.703 --> 02:47:44.502
MATT: 21?
LAURA: Sentinel!

02:47:44.502 --> 02:47:45.502
MARISHA: Oh wait, do I get to hit it?

02:47:45.502 --> 02:47:46.335
MATT: Oh no, no.

02:47:46.335 --> 02:47:47.774
You are grappled and restrained.

02:47:47.774 --> 02:47:48.952
You...

02:47:48.952 --> 02:47:51.527
No, you're in its mouth because you are traveling with it,

02:47:53.097 --> 02:47:55.105
but that does hit so it doesn't move.

02:47:55.105 --> 02:47:56.550
So it stays put.

02:47:58.242 --> 02:47:59.629
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:47:59.629 --> 02:48:00.964
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:48:00.964 --> 02:48:01.800
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:02.783
MATT: This is interesting.

02:48:02.783 --> 02:48:04.012
Okay.

02:48:04.012 --> 02:48:05.572
So yeah, it does not move at all.

02:48:05.572 --> 02:48:06.972
It is currently still--

02:48:06.972 --> 02:48:09.372
TRAVIS: A good thing and a bad thing.

02:48:09.372 --> 02:48:10.313
MATT: -- in the space here.

02:48:10.313 --> 02:48:12.182
LAURA: Why is that a bad thing?

02:48:12.182 --> 02:48:14.150
MATT: Oh, you'll find out.

02:48:15.112 --> 02:48:15.945
All right, so

02:48:15.945 --> 02:48:18.154
roll damage on that one, if you don't mind, Yasha.

02:48:19.452 --> 02:48:20.285
TALIESIN: What do you think, damage--

02:48:20.285 --> 02:48:22.082
SAM: It's a nuclear T-Rex.

02:48:22.082 --> 02:48:23.870
TALIESIN: Do we damage it or do we, like...

02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:24.703
MATT: Yes.

02:48:24.703 --> 02:48:26.279
It'll detonate.

02:48:26.279 --> 02:48:29.070
You watch as the green in its eyes glows.

02:48:30.102 --> 02:48:33.162
You see the little digit numbers counting down in his eyes.

02:48:33.162 --> 02:48:35.311
You hear it starts laughing like Predator.

02:48:35.311 --> 02:48:36.865
(deep laughter)

02:48:36.865 --> 02:48:38.519
What was the damage?

02:48:38.519 --> 02:48:39.372
ASHLEY: 21.

02:48:39.372 --> 02:48:41.142
MATT: 21. You got it.

02:48:41.142 --> 02:48:41.975
Nice.

02:48:41.975 --> 02:48:44.945
MATT: So as you hack, you see the area of it,

02:48:44.945 --> 02:48:46.292
as it tries to move the leg

02:48:46.292 --> 02:48:47.852
where it had been pummeled by Beauregard,

02:48:47.852 --> 02:48:50.732
it's already bruised and swollen.

02:48:50.732 --> 02:48:52.849
And with that, you just take the blade in one swing,

02:48:52.849 --> 02:48:54.507
(swoosh) cut the Achilles tendon and

02:48:54.507 --> 02:48:56.442
(crumbling) it buckles and can't move,

02:48:56.442 --> 02:48:58.394
and it roars, angrily.

02:48:58.394 --> 02:49:00.578
But the roar's muffled because its
mouth is filled with Beauregard.

02:49:00.578 --> 02:49:02.539
So it's more like (gurgling)

02:49:02.539 --> 02:49:03.881
With also a little bit of her scream in there.

02:49:03.881 --> 02:49:04.714
(high-pitched scream)

02:49:04.714 --> 02:49:05.980
So it's-- it just sounds awful.

02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:07.472
It's like a horrible goat braying.

02:49:08.322 --> 02:49:09.452
TRAVIS and LAURA: (goat braying)

02:49:09.452 --> 02:49:10.472
MATT: Yep. All right.

02:49:10.472 --> 02:49:11.992
Finishing that turn...

02:49:11.992 --> 02:49:13.615
Caduceus, you're up.
MARISHA: That was great.

02:49:13.615 --> 02:49:15.465
SAM: ♪ Trouble trouble, trouble ♪

02:49:16.739 --> 02:49:18.442
TALIESIN: How hurt is this thing looking?

02:49:18.442 --> 02:49:19.482
MATT: It's hurt.

02:49:19.482 --> 02:49:20.792
It's not on death's door,

02:49:20.792 --> 02:49:22.772
but it's showing some wear and tear.

02:49:22.772 --> 02:49:23.942
You can see from the blows it's taking

02:49:23.942 --> 02:49:27.452
it's bleeding out in some areas of the heavy wounds.

02:49:27.452 --> 02:49:29.082
Its head is stuck currently

02:49:29.082 --> 02:49:32.562
in a giant wall of spinning ethereal blades--

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:33.942
TALIESIN: Ray of Enfeeblement again.

02:49:33.942 --> 02:49:35.615
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

02:49:36.982 --> 02:49:38.782
TALIESIN: Ooh. 14?

02:49:38.782 --> 02:49:40.432
MATT: 14? Does hit.

02:49:40.432 --> 02:49:41.602
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

02:49:41.602 --> 02:49:43.282
MATT: 14 is its armor class.

02:49:43.282 --> 02:49:44.115
It just hits.

02:49:44.115 --> 02:49:46.259
All right, it's Enfeebled again.

02:49:46.259 --> 02:49:48.292
TRAVIS: (groan of sympathy)

02:49:49.381 --> 02:49:51.238
LIAM: (elderly) I'm sore.
LAURA: He's so old.

02:49:51.238 --> 02:49:52.071
MATT: Not every--

02:49:52.071 --> 02:49:55.432
You know, when you get the jump on him like that...

02:49:55.432 --> 02:49:56.485
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:49:56.485 --> 02:49:57.842
MATT: It's not that hard.

02:49:57.842 --> 02:50:00.441
Seven players on one creature while it's sleeping.

02:50:00.441 --> 02:50:03.334
TRAVIS: I did not think a crit would insta-kill Beau.

02:50:03.334 --> 02:50:05.582
Or drop to zero, rather.

02:50:05.582 --> 02:50:06.662
TALIESIN: I can't throw a Healing Word,

02:50:06.662 --> 02:50:07.842
can I right now or no?

02:50:07.842 --> 02:50:09.540
MATT: No, because--
TALIESIN: It's a bonus action?

02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:10.373
MATT: Yeah.

02:50:11.515 --> 02:50:13.724
TALIESIN: To the T-Rex!
MATT: Just to even the odds.

02:50:13.724 --> 02:50:14.709
Make it interesting.

02:50:14.709 --> 02:50:16.336
TALIESIN: I'm going to duck back.

02:50:16.336 --> 02:50:18.182
I'm going to find cover again then.

02:50:18.182 --> 02:50:20.307
MATT: Okay. So you dart back behind this tree, then?

02:50:20.307 --> 02:50:21.767
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm good.
MATT: All right.

02:50:21.767 --> 02:50:23.706
TRAVIS: Give old Dale a couple of hit points.

02:50:23.706 --> 02:50:24.539
MATT: Veth, it's your turn.

02:50:24.539 --> 02:50:25.988
SAM: Oh, me?
MATT: Yes.

02:50:25.988 --> 02:50:29.432
SAM: I will reload and fire again.

02:50:29.432 --> 02:50:31.173
Sharpshooter.
ASHLEY: Come on, Veth.

02:50:32.412 --> 02:50:34.942
SAM: 12 plus 10 minus five is

02:50:34.942 --> 02:50:36.192
17 to hit.

02:50:36.192 --> 02:50:37.512
MATT: 17 does hit.

02:50:37.512 --> 02:50:39.212
SAM: All right.

02:50:39.212 --> 02:50:40.762
Still get sneak attack damage?

02:50:40.762 --> 02:50:41.902
Is it engaged?

02:50:41.902 --> 02:50:44.415
MATT: It is very engaged with many things right now.

02:50:45.601 --> 02:50:46.873
TRAVIS: Not me!

02:50:50.082 --> 02:50:51.647
MATT: Nope!
TALIESIN: You are such a cheerleader.

02:50:51.647 --> 02:50:53.632
LAURA: I know! You made us do this!

02:50:53.632 --> 02:50:54.549
TALIESIN: You're the kid who took us to the

02:50:54.549 --> 02:50:55.689
rollercoaster, like, "Nope."
SAM: 38.

02:50:55.689 --> 02:50:57.656
MATT: 38 points of damage. Nice.
LIAM: He's delegating.

02:50:57.656 --> 02:51:00.182
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Rogues are so cool!

02:51:00.182 --> 02:51:01.282
MATT: You fire again.

02:51:01.282 --> 02:51:02.811
You wait a second, and you're about to shoot,

02:51:02.811 --> 02:51:04.452
and then as it turns its head out of the blades,

02:51:04.452 --> 02:51:06.661
you can see Beauregard's arm off to the side,

02:51:06.661 --> 02:51:08.542
and you're like, "Nope, not that."
You shoot a little lower.

02:51:08.542 --> 02:51:11.152
It fires, strikes right above the clavicle area,

02:51:11.152 --> 02:51:13.057
and as the bolt sinks and you could see gouts of blood go

02:51:13.057 --> 02:51:14.617
(burbling).
SAM: Oh boy.

02:51:14.617 --> 02:51:16.282
TRAVIS: Ooh, arterial.

02:51:16.282 --> 02:51:18.289
SAM: Ooh, boy.
TALIESIN: How much damage was that again?

02:51:18.289 --> 02:51:19.580
SAM: 38.
TALIESIN: Okay. Fuck.

02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:20.413
I should have...
MATT: Yeah.

02:51:20.413 --> 02:51:21.704
TALIESIN: I almost doubled it.

02:51:21.704 --> 02:51:22.704
Damn it.

02:51:22.704 --> 02:51:23.820
SAM: Almost doubled it?

02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:26.729
TALIESIN: I can do that, but this is better.

02:51:26.729 --> 02:51:27.928
This is better.
MATT: This is fine.

02:51:27.928 --> 02:51:29.537
TRAVIS: You can double it before it hits?

02:51:29.537 --> 02:51:30.553
MATT: Do you want to move or stay put?

02:51:30.553 --> 02:51:32.169
SAM: I'll stay put.

02:51:32.169 --> 02:51:35.081
I'm just starting to feel bad for the creature now.

02:51:35.081 --> 02:51:37.342
MATT: Okay. Jester, your turn.

02:51:37.342 --> 02:51:38.272
LAURA: Okay.

02:51:38.272 --> 02:51:43.272
I'm going to Guiding Bolt it.

02:51:43.432 --> 02:51:45.415
MATT: All right. You--
LAURA: At 5th-level.

02:51:45.415 --> 02:51:47.894
MATT: You can partially see it from where you are,

02:51:47.894 --> 02:51:49.235
but you can move a little bit.
LAURA: I'll move so I can.

02:51:49.235 --> 02:51:50.451
MATT: All right. So at 5th-level--

02:51:50.451 --> 02:51:51.284
SAM: Actually, Matt, can I--

02:51:51.284 --> 02:51:53.712
can I use my bonus action to just sort of scan to see if

02:51:53.712 --> 02:51:56.054
there's any other T-Rexes?
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

02:51:56.054 --> 02:51:57.108
TRAVIS: Good call.

02:51:59.312 --> 02:52:00.232
SAM: 13.

02:52:00.232 --> 02:52:01.772
MATT: 13.

02:52:01.772 --> 02:52:03.129
At the moment, it seems pretty safe.

02:52:03.129 --> 02:52:03.962
SAM: Okay, we're good.

02:52:03.962 --> 02:52:05.499
MATT: Birds have scattered.

02:52:05.499 --> 02:52:07.024
That's all.
SAM: Okay.

02:52:07.024 --> 02:52:08.974
MATT: Okay. Jester, what are you doing?

02:52:08.974 --> 02:52:10.325
LAURA: Guiding Bolt it 5th-level.

02:52:10.325 --> 02:52:12.136
MATT: I hate it.

02:52:12.136 --> 02:52:13.784
TRAVIS: Commotion in the...

02:52:13.784 --> 02:52:15.383
LAURA: 15.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:52:15.383 --> 02:52:16.328
LAURA: 15 to hit.

02:52:16.328 --> 02:52:17.572
MATT: 15 does hit.

02:52:17.572 --> 02:52:19.650
LAURA: Okay. So that's 8d6.

02:52:22.572 --> 02:52:23.972
One, two, three, four, five,

02:52:24.822 --> 02:52:26.585
six, seven, eight.

02:52:29.612 --> 02:52:30.445
Ten...

02:52:30.445 --> 02:52:31.902
16.

02:52:31.902 --> 02:52:34.035
Oh, that's a lot of ones.

02:52:34.035 --> 02:52:34.991
16, 17, 18,

02:52:34.991 --> 02:52:38.192
19 plus four...

02:52:39.542 --> 02:52:42.012
19 plus four's 23.

02:52:42.012 --> 02:52:42.845
SAM: That's great.

02:52:42.845 --> 02:52:44.708
MATT: 23 points of damage. All right, nice.

02:52:44.708 --> 02:52:46.841
LAURA: And it's advantage on the next--
MATT: On the next strike against it.

02:52:46.841 --> 02:52:48.702
As Jester comes from behind the tree,

02:52:48.702 --> 02:52:50.082
and releases the Guiding Bolt,

02:52:50.082 --> 02:52:55.082
you watch as the swirling, pinkish-purple blast,

02:52:55.192 --> 02:52:56.412
strikes up, impacts it,

02:52:56.412 --> 02:52:58.952
and sends these ribbons of divine energy

02:52:58.952 --> 02:53:00.262
around it that have this

02:53:00.262 --> 02:53:01.702
pointed, dotted arrow

02:53:01.702 --> 02:53:03.059
going, "Hit here."

02:53:03.059 --> 02:53:03.892
"Hit here."

02:53:03.892 --> 02:53:05.002
"Hit here."

02:53:05.002 --> 02:53:06.482
LAURA: Blink, blink, blink!

02:53:06.482 --> 02:53:07.873
MATT: All right. Are you going to stay put,

02:53:07.873 --> 02:53:08.773
or are you going to move behind the tree again?

02:53:08.773 --> 02:53:11.152
LAURA: I'll back up a little bit.

02:53:11.152 --> 02:53:13.643
MATT: All right. Get a little bit of space between you,

02:53:13.643 --> 02:53:17.422
blocking perspective of the very dangerous creature.

02:53:17.422 --> 02:53:19.277
Finishing Jester's turn. Caleb, you are up.

02:53:19.277 --> 02:53:20.418
Fjord, you're on deck.

02:53:20.418 --> 02:53:24.642
LIAM: So with Jester's advantage,
I will bite into his haunch.

02:53:24.642 --> 02:53:25.475
MATT: Go for it.

02:53:26.915 --> 02:53:28.787
LIAM: That is 27 to hit.

02:53:28.787 --> 02:53:31.205
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:53:31.205 --> 02:53:32.038
LIAM: (high-pitched) Ah!

02:53:34.874 --> 02:53:37.132
25, 32 points of damage.

02:53:37.132 --> 02:53:37.965
SAM: Wow!

02:53:37.965 --> 02:53:39.304
MATT: 32 points of damage.

02:53:39.304 --> 02:53:41.412
LIAM: And not because there's anything behind me,

02:53:41.412 --> 02:53:42.452
but just because I can,

02:53:42.452 --> 02:53:44.752
I will use my tail attack to slam the ground,

02:53:44.752 --> 02:53:46.322
because I am a fucking dinosaur.

02:53:46.322 --> 02:53:47.421
MATT: Indeed you do.

02:53:47.421 --> 02:53:49.115
(massive thud)

02:53:49.115 --> 02:53:50.822
This dirt and dust, and

02:53:50.822 --> 02:53:53.812
bits of leaf and vegetative matter,

02:53:53.812 --> 02:53:55.072
just get shot up into the air

02:53:55.072 --> 02:53:58.583
in this wide spray of whatever was behind Caleb.

02:53:58.583 --> 02:54:00.327
LIAM: It was Veth.

02:54:00.327 --> 02:54:01.411
SAM: (screams)

02:54:01.411 --> 02:54:03.138
MATT: Veth definitely gets spattered with a bunch of it.

02:54:03.138 --> 02:54:03.978
(coughs)

02:54:03.978 --> 02:54:05.701
All right. That finishes your go, Caleb.

02:54:05.701 --> 02:54:06.543
Fjord, you're up.

02:54:06.543 --> 02:54:07.376
TRAVIS: Oh yes.

02:54:08.539 --> 02:54:10.750
I'm just enjoying the view.

02:54:10.750 --> 02:54:13.722
Three more Eldritch Blasts.
MATT: Go for it.

02:54:13.722 --> 02:54:15.755
LIAM: A-one, a-two, a-three.

02:54:15.755 --> 02:54:18.492
TRAVIS: A 23 for the first one.

02:54:18.492 --> 02:54:19.797
That's cocked.

02:54:19.797 --> 02:54:21.532
It's a natural one on the second.

02:54:21.532 --> 02:54:23.092
ASHLEY: You have advantage.

02:54:23.092 --> 02:54:23.925
TRAVIS: I do?

02:54:23.925 --> 02:54:24.898
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: Guiding Bolt?

02:54:24.898 --> 02:54:26.306
TALIESIN: Only for the next attack, which was Caleb.

02:54:26.306 --> 02:54:27.480
ASHLEY: Oh, that was you were next.

02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:29.304
TRAVIS: And a 22 on the third one.

02:54:29.304 --> 02:54:30.137
MATT: Okay, so two hit.

02:54:30.137 --> 02:54:32.236
ASHLEY: I don't know where I just was.

02:54:32.236 --> 02:54:34.429
MATT: That's all good.

02:54:34.429 --> 02:54:35.700
TRAVIS: Nine plus five.

02:54:35.700 --> 02:54:36.892
14.

02:54:36.892 --> 02:54:38.642
That's off the table, but it's a ten.

02:54:39.805 --> 02:54:41.582
29 points of force damage.

02:54:41.582 --> 02:54:43.992
MATT: Okay, so as all of this is happening,

02:54:43.992 --> 02:54:44.825
you have that moment

02:54:44.825 --> 02:54:46.182
where you turn around in slow motion.

02:54:46.182 --> 02:54:49.153
You can hear the sad Enya music start playing.

02:54:49.153 --> 02:54:49.986
It's just like--

02:54:49.986 --> 02:54:51.922
(sad roaring)

02:54:51.922 --> 02:54:54.172
Its head in this cloud of blades,

02:54:54.172 --> 02:54:57.192
Beauregard slowly flailing in its jaws.

02:54:57.192 --> 02:54:58.321
How do you want to do this?

02:54:58.321 --> 02:55:01.102
(cheering and laughter)

02:55:01.102 --> 02:55:02.710
LIAM: That's just right!

02:55:04.507 --> 02:55:08.883
TRAVIS: I'll aim the Eldritch Blast and I'll go: Sorry!

02:55:08.883 --> 02:55:10.605
(explosion)

02:55:10.605 --> 02:55:12.939
MATT: (slow motion impacts)

02:55:12.939 --> 02:55:13.994
TRAVIS: No!

02:55:13.994 --> 02:55:15.469
MATT: (sad roaring)

02:55:15.469 --> 02:55:16.480
LIAM: K.O.

02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:19.848
MATT: (impacts)
SAM: It's like Platoon?

02:55:19.848 --> 02:55:21.103
TRAVIS: (laughs) The bounce!

02:55:21.103 --> 02:55:23.075
LAURA: With Beau in the mouth like--

02:55:23.075 --> 02:55:26.192
MATT: Beau's just like, "Ow. Ow. Ow."

02:55:26.192 --> 02:55:27.622
You take an additional...

02:55:28.612 --> 02:55:29.782
ten points of piercing damage

02:55:29.782 --> 02:55:32.131
from its head hitting the ground.

02:55:32.131 --> 02:55:34.189
MARISHA: That's fair.
MATT: 'Cause it's fun.

02:55:34.189 --> 02:55:35.914
TRAVIS: The Enya music.

02:55:37.047 --> 02:55:39.198
ASHLEY: ♪ Who can say ♪

02:55:39.198 --> 02:55:44.198
(laughter)

02:55:44.402 --> 02:55:46.612
MATT: I was hoping it would survive
at least to the next round,

02:55:46.612 --> 02:55:47.902
because at the beginning of Beau's turn

02:55:47.902 --> 02:55:49.252
with it held in its jaws

02:55:49.252 --> 02:55:51.810
it would have been holding Beau in the Blade Wall as well.

02:55:51.810 --> 02:55:53.694
LAURA: I know, I know!

02:55:53.694 --> 02:55:56.155
MATT: Just-- (jet noises)
TRAVIS: (fake scream)

02:55:57.104 --> 02:55:59.338
LIAM: There go her feet.

02:55:59.338 --> 02:56:00.521
(shredding)

02:56:00.521 --> 02:56:02.596
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: But now the creature is down.

02:56:03.752 --> 02:56:04.692
A silence,

02:56:04.692 --> 02:56:07.569
a hush falls over this section of the jungle.

02:56:07.569 --> 02:56:08.752
TALIESIN: Is anything approaching?

02:56:08.752 --> 02:56:10.052
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:56:11.342 --> 02:56:14.882
TALIESIN: That's a 22.

02:56:14.882 --> 02:56:15.715
MATT: 22.

02:56:15.715 --> 02:56:19.182
Looking around, the birds haven't returned.

02:56:19.182 --> 02:56:20.015
It is quiet,

02:56:20.015 --> 02:56:23.181
and you get the sense that the

02:56:23.181 --> 02:56:26.197
combative roars of this creature

02:56:26.197 --> 02:56:29.267
probably sent anything else scattering within a radius.

02:56:29.267 --> 02:56:32.582
So you feel you may be safe for a little while.

02:56:32.582 --> 02:56:34.252
As you all settle down,

02:56:34.252 --> 02:56:36.462
the adrenaline fading a bit.

02:56:36.462 --> 02:56:40.572
The realization that there is a giant Bengal-striped T-Rex

02:56:40.572 --> 02:56:41.512
Caleb there--

02:56:41.512 --> 02:56:45.562
LIAM: Who looks back and forth for a moment,

02:56:45.562 --> 02:56:50.415
and then takes a bite of the dead T-Rex.

02:56:50.415 --> 02:56:53.432
TALIESIN: That's for later.
MARISHA: Oh, that's for the con, man!

02:56:53.432 --> 02:56:55.531
LIAM: (munching sounds)

02:56:55.531 --> 02:56:58.347
MARISHA: Where's that even going
to go when you bamf back to Caleb?

02:56:58.347 --> 02:57:00.122
SAM: Are you still in the mouth?

02:57:00.122 --> 02:57:01.580
Are you out?
MARISHA: I think I'm out.

02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:02.945
MATT: You probably crawled out of it at this point.

02:57:02.945 --> 02:57:03.972
MARISHA: I'm bleeding a lot.

02:57:03.972 --> 02:57:06.474
MATT: Yeah, just a blood-covered Beauregard, like--

02:57:06.474 --> 02:57:09.851
(grunting) pushing out of its jaws.

02:57:09.851 --> 02:57:11.862
LAURA: Oh, Beau, you look awful,

02:57:11.862 --> 02:57:14.512
but so cool at the same time.

02:57:14.512 --> 02:57:17.955
MARISHA: Yeah. These are going to be some dope scars, man.

02:57:17.955 --> 02:57:19.645
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:57:19.645 --> 02:57:20.478
ASHLEY: It's going to be pretty cool.

02:57:20.478 --> 02:57:22.805
LIAM: Yeah. Those teeth holes that are this wide.

02:57:22.805 --> 02:57:24.026
All around your body?

02:57:24.026 --> 02:57:27.355
MARISHA: Yeah, just-- (placement sounds).

02:57:27.355 --> 02:57:28.862
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you a little bit of Cure Wounds.

02:57:28.862 --> 02:57:31.779
TRAVIS: How do we transport this?

02:57:31.779 --> 02:57:33.221
SAM: Can you Polymorph a dead thing?

02:57:33.221 --> 02:57:34.623
LAURA: I was just thinking about that.

02:57:34.623 --> 02:57:37.206
Can you Polymorph a dead thing?

02:57:39.012 --> 02:57:41.602
MATT: Generally, it's reserved for a living creature.

02:57:41.602 --> 02:57:42.435
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:57:42.435 --> 02:57:45.830
SAM: Can we heal it back up just to Polymorph it?

02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:48.357
(chuckling)

02:57:48.357 --> 02:57:50.172
TALIESIN: 21 points.

02:57:51.582 --> 02:57:52.415
MATT: That's a tough call.

02:57:52.415 --> 02:57:54.905
Because once the creature dies, it's now an object

02:57:54.905 --> 02:57:56.688
as opposed to a creature.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:57:56.688 --> 02:57:57.582
That makes sense.

02:57:57.582 --> 02:57:59.119
Well, maybe--
TALIESIN: Well, we have another T--

02:57:59.119 --> 02:58:00.072
LAURA: Yeah, Caleb--

02:58:00.072 --> 02:58:00.905
TALIESIN: Lash it--

02:58:00.905 --> 02:58:03.362
LAURA: -- dinosaur Caleb can pull him along.

02:58:03.362 --> 02:58:05.142
SAM: For 45 minutes anyway.

02:58:05.142 --> 02:58:06.252
LIAM: For a while, yeah.

02:58:06.252 --> 02:58:07.372
That's what I was thinking.

02:58:07.372 --> 02:58:08.962
SAM: All right, let's do that.

02:58:08.962 --> 02:58:12.272
LAURA: I can always Polymorph into one after Caleb's dies,

02:58:12.272 --> 02:58:14.906
and then I can pull him along.

02:58:14.906 --> 02:58:16.245
LIAM: Caleb steals another bite.

02:58:16.245 --> 02:58:17.228
LAURA: No! Stop!
SAM: No!

02:58:17.228 --> 02:58:18.144
Caleb, stop it!

02:58:18.144 --> 02:58:20.145
SAM: That's for paying customers!

02:58:20.145 --> 02:58:22.262
MATT: (laughs)

02:58:22.262 --> 02:58:24.424
LIAM: It's a big dinosaur.

02:58:24.424 --> 02:58:26.892
TALIESIN: I'll cast something on you.

02:58:26.892 --> 02:58:27.892
MATT: All right.

02:58:27.892 --> 02:58:29.912
So who here has animal handling?

02:58:32.212 --> 02:58:33.322
LAURA: Me?

02:58:33.322 --> 02:58:34.497
TALIESIN: Medium.

02:58:35.372 --> 02:58:37.312
LIAM: Caleb will take it by the tail,

02:58:37.312 --> 02:58:39.422
and lift the tail up and then look at the group.

02:58:39.422 --> 02:58:41.172
MATT: Okay. Do you want to use--

02:58:41.172 --> 02:58:43.935
Do you want to try and guide Caleb

02:58:43.935 --> 02:58:46.032
in his Tyrannosaurus Rex state?

02:58:46.032 --> 02:58:47.421
LAURA: Sure.

02:58:47.421 --> 02:58:48.842
Caleb!

02:58:48.842 --> 02:58:49.908
LIAM: (soft growl)

02:58:50.992 --> 02:58:53.817
LAURA: Can I climb onto your back?

02:58:53.817 --> 02:58:55.299
LIAM: (growly exhale)

02:58:55.299 --> 02:58:56.410
LAURA: That's a yes, right?

02:58:56.410 --> 02:58:57.925
MARISHA: I think so, yeah.

02:58:57.925 --> 02:59:00.192
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

02:59:00.192 --> 02:59:02.216
LAURA: (laughs)

02:59:02.216 --> 02:59:05.232
MATT: Go ahead and make an animal handling check.

02:59:05.232 --> 02:59:08.502
LAURA: I'm going to guide myself as I do this.

02:59:08.502 --> 02:59:09.885
TRAVIS: I'm going to put a T-Rex

02:59:09.885 --> 02:59:12.332
in an internet D&amp;D show.
TALIESIN: I speak T-Rex.

02:59:12.332 --> 02:59:13.723
LAURA: Oh no!

02:59:15.322 --> 02:59:16.684
A one.

02:59:16.684 --> 02:59:17.583
MARISHA: No!

02:59:17.583 --> 02:59:18.658
LAURA: Oh no!

02:59:19.622 --> 02:59:22.780
MATT: That little blue tiefling looks really delicious,

02:59:23.882 --> 02:59:24.722
but you know better.

02:59:24.722 --> 02:59:25.632
You know better.

02:59:25.632 --> 02:59:26.952
But you just--

02:59:26.952 --> 02:59:29.182
you're uncertain of their plan necessarily,

02:59:29.182 --> 02:59:30.952
so it's going to take you guys a little bit of time to try

02:59:30.952 --> 02:59:34.082
and lash this very large--

02:59:34.082 --> 02:59:36.074
like we're talking-- this is...

02:59:37.172 --> 02:59:39.885
many thousands of pounds of meat here.

02:59:39.885 --> 02:59:41.052
If you're going to bring the body

02:59:41.052 --> 02:59:43.242
it's going to be a collected effort.

02:59:43.242 --> 02:59:44.622
All of you plus this

02:59:44.622 --> 02:59:45.672
and whatever spells you have at your

02:59:45.672 --> 02:59:47.158
disposal that might aid this.

02:59:47.158 --> 02:59:47.991
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

02:59:47.991 --> 02:59:51.682
LAURA: Could I try to-- if I Polymorph myself,

02:59:51.682 --> 02:59:54.572
is it going to be another difficult thing of trying to

02:59:54.572 --> 02:59:56.412
figure it out, too? Or...

02:59:56.412 --> 02:59:59.129
TALIESIN: I think once we figure it out--
LAURA: Once I know, I can Polymorph myself.

02:59:59.129 --> 03:00:00.940
MATT: If Polymorph yourself anew with the idea--

03:00:00.940 --> 03:00:02.402
it's less about like--

03:00:02.402 --> 03:00:04.127
you don't lose all memory of who you are,

03:00:04.127 --> 03:00:05.312
and your friends and such,

03:00:05.312 --> 03:00:08.002
but for a creature of this intellect,

03:00:08.002 --> 03:00:10.205
it can be challenging to...

03:00:12.622 --> 03:00:15.132
to convey complicated ideas.

03:00:15.132 --> 03:00:16.892
But if you are taking it in,

03:00:16.892 --> 03:00:20.179
I'll allow you to maintain at least elements of that.

03:00:20.179 --> 03:00:24.015
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to also
Polymorph myself into a T-Rex.

03:00:24.015 --> 03:00:25.599
MATT: What does your T-Rex look like?

03:00:25.599 --> 03:00:26.690
LAURA: Blue?

03:00:30.192 --> 03:00:31.325
MATT: I mean, I assumed. I just wanted to--

03:00:31.325 --> 03:00:32.516
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:32.516 --> 03:00:33.349
No, yeah.

03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:34.374
Blue, but with like--

03:00:34.374 --> 03:00:38.379
Can I make him have purple freckles all over?

03:00:38.379 --> 03:00:39.212
MATT: Yeah.

03:00:39.212 --> 03:00:41.454
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: So like the-- was it the...

03:00:42.552 --> 03:00:45.079
The weird Pop-Tarts with the blue and purple icing?

03:00:45.079 --> 03:00:47.772
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, exactly like that.

03:00:47.772 --> 03:00:48.992
ASHLEY: J.P. Sullivan.

03:00:48.992 --> 03:00:49.825
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:49.825 --> 03:00:51.414
MATT: All right, so

03:00:51.414 --> 03:00:54.532
we now have a Bengal-striped T-Rex,

03:00:54.532 --> 03:00:57.236
and a blue Pop-Tart T-Rex--

03:00:57.236 --> 03:00:58.312
SAM: Dragging a white T-Rex.

03:00:58.312 --> 03:01:00.416
MATT: Dragging a white dead T-Rex.

03:01:00.416 --> 03:01:02.215
TALIESIN: This is the best Mario Party game ever.

03:01:03.232 --> 03:01:04.873
TRAVIS: We all saw this coming.
LAURA: (tiny roar)

03:01:04.873 --> 03:01:05.898
MATT: All right.

03:01:06.752 --> 03:01:08.802
Okay. And since you've only transformed

03:01:08.802 --> 03:01:11.322
for a short time comparatively.

03:01:11.322 --> 03:01:12.962
It'll take you the better part of an hour,

03:01:12.962 --> 03:01:14.022
with the both of your guys help

03:01:14.022 --> 03:01:15.480
and the rest of the party guiding.

03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:17.242
We'll say for the sake of brevity and narrative,

03:01:17.242 --> 03:01:18.872
nobody gets in your way.

03:01:18.872 --> 03:01:21.872
Any of the other creatures that may have been drawn by the

03:01:21.872 --> 03:01:23.702
ruckus through the jungle

03:01:23.702 --> 03:01:26.432
immediately turns around at the sight.

03:01:26.432 --> 03:01:27.342
MARISHA: They do the Fjord?

03:01:27.342 --> 03:01:28.910
Yeah.

03:01:28.910 --> 03:01:30.417
MATT: Yeah. Do the Fjord?

03:01:30.417 --> 03:01:32.182
That's the Fjord?

03:01:32.182 --> 03:01:33.215
MARISHA: (unsure grunt)

03:01:33.215 --> 03:01:34.840
TRAVIS: Mm-mm! Mm-mm!

03:01:35.822 --> 03:01:37.542
MATT: As you approach the outskirts of Vo,

03:01:37.542 --> 03:01:42.249
you begin to hear shouts and screams from people who--

03:01:42.249 --> 03:01:44.642
LAURA: We drop it as we get closer.

03:01:44.642 --> 03:01:45.842
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

03:01:45.842 --> 03:01:46.832
MATT: People--

03:01:46.832 --> 03:01:49.402
they just suddenly see two T-Rexes

03:01:49.402 --> 03:01:52.668
lumbering towards the village holding a third T-Rex.

03:01:52.668 --> 03:01:53.768
TALIESIN: Nothing to see here.

03:01:54.872 --> 03:01:56.762
MATT: You watch this as Vilya arrives

03:01:56.762 --> 03:01:57.595
with a few other folks,

03:01:57.595 --> 03:01:59.372
and eventually calms them down,

03:01:59.372 --> 03:02:01.732
and looks up at the T-Rexes.

03:02:01.732 --> 03:02:02.565
You could see her--

03:02:02.565 --> 03:02:03.622
she's an insightful individual.

03:02:03.622 --> 03:02:05.548
She gauges the color schemes,

03:02:05.548 --> 03:02:10.548
and knows your various skills from the travels

03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:12.365
that she had with you on the island and calms everyone,

03:02:12.365 --> 03:02:15.618
and goes "Well, I'm certainly impressed.

03:02:17.542 --> 03:02:20.002
"Yeah. That'll feed everyone for a while."

03:02:20.002 --> 03:02:21.432
And she begins

03:02:21.432 --> 03:02:23.292
assigning troops of people to start helping

03:02:23.292 --> 03:02:25.982
to carve what they can off the body,

03:02:25.982 --> 03:02:27.212
and as they approach,

03:02:27.212 --> 03:02:30.092
they all still carefully keep a wide berth

03:02:30.092 --> 03:02:33.177
around the two other large T-Rexes that stand there.

03:02:33.177 --> 03:02:36.110
LAURA: I'm going to start dancing as a T-Rex.

03:02:37.522 --> 03:02:41.697
Can I do a couple little kicks,

03:02:41.697 --> 03:02:44.332
you know, like a kick line?
MATT: Yeah. It's more of a--

03:02:44.332 --> 03:02:45.662
LAURA: I mean, my arms are doing this,

03:02:45.662 --> 03:02:47.009
but I'm doing big kicks with my legs.

03:02:47.009 --> 03:02:48.593
TRAVIS: You're doing wings?

03:02:48.593 --> 03:02:49.426
MATT: Make a performance check.

03:02:49.426 --> 03:02:51.551
MARISHA: The dancing T-Rex emote

03:02:51.551 --> 03:02:53.051
that we use in Slack.
LIAM: Yep.

03:02:53.051 --> 03:02:54.051
MATT: Make a performance check

03:02:54.051 --> 03:02:57.173
with the Tyrannosaurus Rex's charisma, which is a minus one.

03:02:57.173 --> 03:02:58.006
LAURA: Okay.

03:02:58.006 --> 03:02:58.992
LIAM: Rachel is so happy right now.

03:02:58.992 --> 03:03:00.395
MARISHA: Yeah, somewhere Rachel--

03:03:00.395 --> 03:03:01.463
LAURA: Three!

03:03:01.463 --> 03:03:02.296
TRAVIS: Three!

03:03:04.752 --> 03:03:06.152
MATT: In your head, it's a dance.

03:03:07.202 --> 03:03:10.382
To anyone else, it feels like a threatening war stomp.

03:03:10.382 --> 03:03:13.034
And the people that were gathering towards the white T-Rex

03:03:13.034 --> 03:03:16.193
run back about 15 or so feet, and wait for you to finish.

03:03:16.193 --> 03:03:17.252
TRAVIS: Fjord backs up a lot.

03:03:17.252 --> 03:03:18.812
LAURA: I see they're scared and I'll stop.

03:03:18.812 --> 03:03:19.813
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: I take that opportunity

03:03:19.813 --> 03:03:21.021
to take another bite of the corpse.

03:03:21.021 --> 03:03:22.832
ALL: No!

03:03:22.832 --> 03:03:25.940
TALIESIN: We whack you off. No! No! No!

03:03:25.940 --> 03:03:28.266
LAURA: I'm going to use my-- I'll use my tiny arms,

03:03:28.266 --> 03:03:31.057
and try to hit to hit Caleb to make him stop.

03:03:31.057 --> 03:03:32.773
LIAM: (panting)
MATT: All right.

03:03:32.773 --> 03:03:35.862
LIAM: I'm like a dinosaur version of my dog.

03:03:35.862 --> 03:03:37.183
MARISHA: Spray bottle.

03:03:37.183 --> 03:03:38.016
LAURA: No!

03:03:38.016 --> 03:03:39.722
SAM: We did it, guys!
TALIESIN: A little Ray of Enfeeblement.

03:03:39.722 --> 03:03:41.805
LAURA and SAM: We killed a T-Rex!

03:03:43.062 --> 03:03:43.922
MARISHA: I flag them down,

03:03:43.922 --> 03:03:46.447
and I say: The teeth are ours. We get the teeth.

03:03:46.447 --> 03:03:48.024
TALIESIN: If that'd be all right.

03:03:48.024 --> 03:03:48.865
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Please.

03:03:48.865 --> 03:03:50.431
MARISHA: Keep 'em from-- Yeah.

03:03:50.431 --> 03:03:52.072
MATT: Some of the teeth...

03:03:52.072 --> 03:03:54.085
They start asking like, "All, all the teeth?"

03:03:54.085 --> 03:03:55.352
MARISHA: Yes!

03:03:55.352 --> 03:03:56.185
TALIESIN: As many as you can--
SAM: I mean.

03:03:56.185 --> 03:03:57.251
LAURA: Well, one for each.

03:03:57.251 --> 03:03:59.292
SAM: Probably. We just want one each.

03:03:59.292 --> 03:04:02.522
MARISHA: I'm trying to not over-complicate it.

03:04:02.522 --> 03:04:04.502
TALIESIN: As many as you can safely remove.

03:04:04.502 --> 03:04:05.832
MATT: "Can we just keep a few?"

03:04:05.832 --> 03:04:07.712
They start talking about making tools.

03:04:07.712 --> 03:04:08.920
MARISHA: (grumbling) Yeah, you can keep a few.

03:04:08.920 --> 03:04:10.969
TALIESIN: That's fair. Yeah. See what you can pull out.

03:04:10.969 --> 03:04:13.712
MATT: So we'll say, for the remainder of the day,

03:04:13.712 --> 03:04:17.293
the corpse is being prepared for its meat, for its bones.

03:04:17.293 --> 03:04:19.232
It's going to be harvested, and utilized by the villagers

03:04:19.232 --> 03:04:20.432
who are staying behind,

03:04:20.432 --> 03:04:23.122
as well as preparation for the rest of the event,

03:04:23.122 --> 03:04:24.864
as it arises.

03:04:24.864 --> 03:04:27.845
LAURA: Could you make armor out of T-Rex hide?

03:04:28.762 --> 03:04:31.462
MATT: I mean, the right person probably could.

03:04:31.462 --> 03:04:33.912
LAURA: Would it be like-- it's not like dragon armor?

03:04:33.912 --> 03:04:35.552
Cool, like tough hide.

03:04:35.552 --> 03:04:36.482
MATT: Obviously not.

03:04:36.482 --> 03:04:38.982
You guys carved it pretty heavily.

03:04:38.982 --> 03:04:40.642
TRAVIS: Those bones are crazy though.

03:04:40.642 --> 03:04:42.075
MATT: Decorative? It would be awesome.

03:04:42.075 --> 03:04:44.305
TALIESIN: Make a nice pair of boots.
MATT: Effectiveness?

03:04:44.305 --> 03:04:46.905
Eh, questionable.

03:04:46.905 --> 03:04:49.592
TALIESIN: You can put one, one tooth on either foot.

03:04:49.592 --> 03:04:50.632
So you have like, little--

03:04:50.632 --> 03:04:51.582
LAURA: High heels?

03:04:51.582 --> 03:04:53.399
TALIESIN: Or high heels! That's another
way to go. Not on the heel.

03:04:53.399 --> 03:04:55.299
I was thinking on the toe, but the heel is better.

03:04:55.299 --> 03:04:56.231
The heel is way better.

03:04:56.231 --> 03:04:59.151
MARISHA: And be the douchiest club owner.
TALIESIN: It would be so great!

03:04:59.151 --> 03:05:00.235
MATT: Yep.

03:05:00.235 --> 03:05:01.955
ASHLEY: Could make the drums out of the hide.

03:05:01.955 --> 03:05:04.047
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:05:04.047 --> 03:05:04.880
TALIESIN: That'd be pretty.

03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:07.145
LAURA: Let's do a couple of drums out of the T-Rex hide.

03:05:07.145 --> 03:05:08.511
MATT: Okay.

03:05:08.511 --> 03:05:11.572
Taking some of the T-Rex hide, drums are constructed.

03:05:11.572 --> 03:05:13.913
The third day comes to an end.

03:05:15.035 --> 03:05:16.472
MARISHA: Eventful Wednesday.

03:05:16.472 --> 03:05:17.847
MATT: Yeah. Very much so.

03:05:17.847 --> 03:05:19.131
A successful hunt.
TALIESIN: What a week!

03:05:19.131 --> 03:05:21.102
LIAM: Hump day. Hump day!

03:05:21.102 --> 03:05:22.502
MATT: Anything else you wish to do for the third day,

03:05:22.502 --> 03:05:23.335
or lead onto the fourth?

03:05:23.335 --> 03:05:26.132
TRAVIS: Was there a large blood trail
that was left that dragging

03:05:26.132 --> 03:05:28.859
this T-Rex from the wilderness back to the village?

03:05:28.859 --> 03:05:30.997
MATT: Oh yeah.
TRAVIS: Should we do something about that?

03:05:30.997 --> 03:05:31.830
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:33.839
Maybe tomorrow we'll get rid of the blood.

03:05:33.839 --> 03:05:35.063
TRAVIS: Tomorrow. Yeah.

03:05:35.063 --> 03:05:37.593
That's usually where things go well. Okay, yeah.

03:05:37.593 --> 03:05:38.501
We'll go tomorrow.
TALIESIN: Also, we should

03:05:38.501 --> 03:05:40.126
check in to see if they need anything

03:05:40.126 --> 03:05:42.963
for getting the boat up and running.

03:05:42.963 --> 03:05:44.048
LAURA: Tomorrow.
TALIESIN: Yeah, tomorrow.

03:05:44.048 --> 03:05:45.248
Tomorrow.
MARISHA: Tomorrow.

03:05:46.942 --> 03:05:48.045
SAM: Nothing else today.

03:05:48.045 --> 03:05:49.711
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

03:05:49.711 --> 03:05:52.836
Third day comes to a close, an eventful day.

03:05:52.836 --> 03:05:53.832
You rest for the night.

03:05:53.832 --> 03:05:56.742
The fourth day is now at your disposal.

03:05:56.742 --> 03:05:59.682
As you awaken, you see new arrivals

03:05:59.682 --> 03:06:02.092
are beginning to come within the village,

03:06:02.092 --> 03:06:04.602
a group of about 20 or so individuals

03:06:04.602 --> 03:06:08.122
have arrived with their various types of luggage.

03:06:08.122 --> 03:06:10.752
A lot of them are a variety of individuals

03:06:10.752 --> 03:06:13.622
from different levels of class,

03:06:13.622 --> 03:06:17.642
attire that spans a lot of the local Menagerie Coast,

03:06:17.642 --> 03:06:18.475
the Empire,

03:06:18.475 --> 03:06:22.932
There are a couple of possible Xhorhasian individuals there.

03:06:22.932 --> 03:06:25.944
One of which you recognize as an elderly gnoll.

03:06:25.944 --> 03:06:27.635
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: Oh!

03:06:28.652 --> 03:06:31.034
LAURA: I run over to the elderly gnoll.

03:06:31.034 --> 03:06:32.612
MATT: Okay.

03:06:32.612 --> 03:06:34.944
LAURA: Hey, you!

03:06:34.944 --> 03:06:37.747
MATT: "Oh, right. I remember you."

03:06:37.747 --> 03:06:38.705
LAURA: Jester.

03:06:38.705 --> 03:06:40.977
MATT: "Yes. Covak."

03:06:40.977 --> 03:06:42.934
LAURA: Covak. That's right, that's right.

03:06:42.934 --> 03:06:45.196
MATT: "I remember--"
LAURA: Welcome! I'm so glad you're here.

03:06:45.196 --> 03:06:46.943
MATT: "Oh. Thank you for having me."

03:06:46.943 --> 03:06:48.114
LAURA: Yep!

03:06:48.114 --> 03:06:51.281
MATT: You can see he's looking around
with his one larger eye at the crowd.

03:06:52.299 --> 03:06:53.772
"I take it not a lot of folks

03:06:53.772 --> 03:06:56.882
"here hang around with gnolls?"

03:06:56.882 --> 03:06:57.715
And you can see other

03:06:57.715 --> 03:07:01.262
villagers are just looking curiously at this,

03:07:01.262 --> 03:07:06.262
while older, still hunched and towering gnoll figure.

03:07:06.292 --> 03:07:07.225
LAURA: Their loss.

03:07:08.448 --> 03:07:10.119
MATT: "Well, uh.

03:07:10.119 --> 03:07:12.271
"I'm not going to bite anyone."

03:07:12.271 --> 03:07:13.104
LAURA: I know.

03:07:13.104 --> 03:07:14.045
MATT: "Yet."

03:07:14.045 --> 03:07:15.451
Looking at one of the kids nearby.

03:07:15.451 --> 03:07:16.610
He goes like (gasp).

03:07:16.610 --> 03:07:18.777
"(laughs) I'm kidding.

03:07:20.082 --> 03:07:21.374
"Well, where should I set up, then?

03:07:21.374 --> 03:07:22.772
"You're the one running this thing, right?

03:07:22.772 --> 03:07:23.888
"That's what they're saying."
LAURA: Oh yeah.

03:07:23.888 --> 03:07:24.921
Of course.

03:07:24.921 --> 03:07:26.752
High Priestess Jester.

03:07:26.752 --> 03:07:29.039
MATT: "That's amazing.

03:07:29.039 --> 03:07:30.262
"Congratulations."

03:07:30.262 --> 03:07:31.412
LAURA: Thank you.

03:07:31.412 --> 03:07:34.042
You know, I've been a high priestess for quite a while.

03:07:34.042 --> 03:07:35.845
I just didn't want to say anything before.

03:07:35.845 --> 03:07:37.286
MATT: "Oh, uh. Modesty."

03:07:37.286 --> 03:07:38.269
LAURA: Yeah.

03:07:38.269 --> 03:07:40.892
That's one of the descriptive terms

03:07:40.892 --> 03:07:43.597
that is used often for me.

03:07:45.022 --> 03:07:48.802
You can just claim any of the empty rooms.

03:07:48.802 --> 03:07:51.493
You should see if you want

03:07:51.493 --> 03:07:54.572
one of the better ones (tongue clicking)

03:07:54.572 --> 03:07:56.162
you should look for--

03:07:56.162 --> 03:07:58.722
I forget the dwarf's name.

03:07:58.722 --> 03:08:00.092
MATT: Oh, previously? Kellbast.

03:08:00.092 --> 03:08:02.259
LAURA: You should-- no, no, not that one.

03:08:02.259 --> 03:08:03.865
MATT: Oh, sorry. The one who--

03:08:03.865 --> 03:08:04.723
LAURA: BV.

03:08:04.723 --> 03:08:05.556
MATT: Berex.

03:08:05.556 --> 03:08:07.262
LAURA: Berex, you should find Berex.

03:08:07.262 --> 03:08:08.801
He's a dwarf.

03:08:08.801 --> 03:08:10.682
MATT: He's staying with his family.
I think he's going by Doron.

03:08:10.682 --> 03:08:11.515
LAURA: Doron.

03:08:11.515 --> 03:08:13.162
You should find Doron.

03:08:13.162 --> 03:08:15.142
He's a dwarf.

03:08:15.142 --> 03:08:17.952
He's helping to run this-- you know, this area and stuff.

03:08:17.952 --> 03:08:20.068
He'll set you up with a good room.

03:08:20.068 --> 03:08:22.591
MATT: "All right, thank you. I'll--"
LAURA: Tell him I sent you.

03:08:22.591 --> 03:08:23.615
MATT: "Okay."
LAURA: Okay.

03:08:23.615 --> 03:08:24.848
MATT: "All right."

03:08:25.782 --> 03:08:27.262
LAURA: It's going to be great!

03:08:27.262 --> 03:08:29.236
You just wait!

03:08:29.236 --> 03:08:32.011
We're getting ready for some crazy cool stuff here.

03:08:32.011 --> 03:08:33.327
(laughs nervously)

03:08:34.338 --> 03:08:35.734
MATT: "Okay."

03:08:35.734 --> 03:08:38.102
(laughs) He goes off to find--
TRAVIS: No, no.

03:08:38.102 --> 03:08:39.519
This is a lot of confusion,

03:08:39.519 --> 03:08:40.942
but also some weird,

03:08:40.942 --> 03:08:42.302
excited energy from the people

03:08:42.302 --> 03:08:43.692
that are now hosting the newcomers.

03:08:43.692 --> 03:08:46.222
There's new, fresh blood here in this space.

03:08:46.222 --> 03:08:48.202
People from all over the vicinity

03:08:48.202 --> 03:08:51.246
are gathering for a unified purpose,

03:08:51.246 --> 03:08:52.452
but also are getting to know each other.

03:08:52.452 --> 03:08:53.782
Some may have met on the ships,

03:08:53.782 --> 03:08:55.392
and have some rapport built,

03:08:55.392 --> 03:08:58.492
or don't talk to each other after traveling together,

03:08:58.492 --> 03:09:02.092
but once again, it's that odd, uncomfortable, excitement

03:09:02.092 --> 03:09:03.662
and anxiety before an event of everyone

03:09:03.662 --> 03:09:04.902
being pushed together in a room

03:09:04.902 --> 03:09:08.637
and going, "Hi, I'm going to go get my hotel

03:09:08.637 --> 03:09:10.542
"taken care of. See you there, I guess."

03:09:10.542 --> 03:09:12.767
You know. So with that energy, people begin to scatter.

03:09:12.767 --> 03:09:14.842
LAURA: How many people are here now?

03:09:14.842 --> 03:09:15.675
MATT: Now total?

03:09:15.675 --> 03:09:17.382
There's probably 25,

03:09:17.382 --> 03:09:18.484
closer to 30 people.

03:09:18.484 --> 03:09:21.034
LAURA: Wow. Did we end up finishing the path

03:09:21.034 --> 03:09:22.562
all the way up to the top of the volcano?

03:09:22.562 --> 03:09:24.902
TALIESIN: It's pretty close to finished, I think.

03:09:24.902 --> 03:09:27.027
Needs a little-- I think it needs a little bit more--

03:09:27.027 --> 03:09:28.718
we know where it is now. We just--

03:09:28.718 --> 03:09:29.643
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Still just

03:09:29.643 --> 03:09:30.922
getting cleaned up a bit.

03:09:30.922 --> 03:09:32.062
MATT: Because you went on the hunt,

03:09:32.062 --> 03:09:33.462
you lost the day of doing that,

03:09:33.462 --> 03:09:35.522
but you have one more day of clearing up.

03:09:35.522 --> 03:09:36.513
TALIESIN: I'll do it.
MATT: Okay.

03:09:36.513 --> 03:09:37.346
TALIESIN: I got it.

03:09:37.346 --> 03:09:39.562
MARISHA: Did anyone set up the bar?

03:09:39.562 --> 03:09:40.412
LAURA: You should do that.

03:09:40.412 --> 03:09:42.078
MARISHA: I should do that.
LAURA: You know what you're doing there?

03:09:42.078 --> 03:09:42.911
MARISHA: I do.

03:09:42.911 --> 03:09:45.304
I start to set up the bar today.
MATT: All right.

03:09:45.304 --> 03:09:47.587
LAURA: Caleb, maybe we should make something amazing

03:09:47.587 --> 03:09:49.395
towards the top of the volcano.

03:09:49.395 --> 03:09:51.228
LIAM: Right at the peak or on the way?

03:09:51.228 --> 03:09:52.061
LAURA: Like, as we--

03:09:52.061 --> 03:09:53.382
maybe at the bottom of the volcano,

03:09:53.382 --> 03:09:55.519
like as you're going up to the top or something.

03:09:55.519 --> 03:09:57.184
Some really cool...

03:09:58.622 --> 03:09:59.652
TALIESIN: Save me.

03:09:59.652 --> 03:10:03.738
LAURA: Like a lot of dicks sort of thing.

03:10:03.738 --> 03:10:04.751
You know, because at that point

03:10:04.751 --> 03:10:07.526
we're all sacrificing our dicks, you know.

03:10:07.526 --> 03:10:09.502
LIAM: Yeah. Here's what we will do.

03:10:09.502 --> 03:10:10.892
At the beginning of the pathway

03:10:10.892 --> 03:10:15.612
that Caduceus has created, I will make on each side

03:10:15.612 --> 03:10:18.332
of the path going 30 feet up

03:10:18.332 --> 03:10:21.952
a series of floating circular icons,

03:10:21.952 --> 03:10:25.662
and each one is a crescent moon

03:10:25.662 --> 03:10:28.542
with a dick pointing through it,

03:10:28.542 --> 03:10:30.852
creating the look of a bow and arrow

03:10:31.732 --> 03:10:35.922
combining the Moon Weaver, plus your gentleman,

03:10:35.922 --> 03:10:39.352
and so that'd be like runway lights pointing up.

03:10:39.352 --> 03:10:40.185
LAURA: That's really wonderful.

03:10:40.185 --> 03:10:41.990
SAM: It's like a Soviet sort of--

03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:43.514
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, correct, but with penises.
SAM: Hammer and sickle?

03:10:43.514 --> 03:10:44.503
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:10:44.503 --> 03:10:45.782
LAURA: Caleb.

03:10:45.782 --> 03:10:48.422
I think you've missed your calling as an artist.

03:10:48.422 --> 03:10:52.955
These are really amazing works of art

03:10:52.955 --> 03:10:54.279
that you're creating.

03:10:54.279 --> 03:10:55.375
LIAM: You rub off on people.

03:10:55.375 --> 03:10:56.550
LAURA: (giggles)

03:10:57.502 --> 03:10:59.942
MATT: As you are setting up the bar,

03:10:59.942 --> 03:11:01.462
the brief conversation comes around

03:11:01.462 --> 03:11:04.013
of the villagers there going,

03:11:06.239 --> 03:11:11.239
"The problem is we don't really have a way to make alcohol.

03:11:11.592 --> 03:11:14.715
"All of us lived without it for this long.

03:11:14.715 --> 03:11:19.524
"We don't have a still or any means of doing that."

03:11:20.564 --> 03:11:22.574
MARISHA: Huh. Wow.

03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:27.032
You do you realize the art of booze making

03:11:27.032 --> 03:11:28.752
has been around for, like, thousands of years,

03:11:28.752 --> 03:11:29.952
and it's really not that hard to, like,

03:11:29.952 --> 03:11:32.259
ferment the fruit you guys have locally?

03:11:32.259 --> 03:11:34.159
MATT: "Oh, I'm sure, but

03:11:34.159 --> 03:11:35.639
"we didn't think to do that."

03:11:35.639 --> 03:11:37.322
MARISHA: I don't know, like, how that's an

03:11:37.322 --> 03:11:39.510
afterthought, you know?

03:11:40.899 --> 03:11:41.732
MATT: "Well, I mean, I--"

03:11:41.732 --> 03:11:42.829
and he's trying to explain himself,

03:11:42.829 --> 03:11:45.149
and a voice behind you goes like,

03:11:45.149 --> 03:11:46.865
"I'm sorry. I heard someone saying

03:11:46.865 --> 03:11:48.432
"there's a problem with alcohol?"

03:11:49.932 --> 03:11:51.622
MATT: You turn around--
MARISHA: Yeah. Who are you?

03:11:51.622 --> 03:11:54.892
MATT: You see a middle-aged halfling

03:11:54.892 --> 03:11:57.252
with this thick chin beard,

03:11:57.252 --> 03:11:59.422
but his hair is shaved on the sides

03:11:59.422 --> 03:12:02.282
with this black pompadour that goes to the back

03:12:02.282 --> 03:12:05.282
looks like a little Keith Richards-esque?

03:12:05.282 --> 03:12:07.742
Just half the size of a normal person,

03:12:07.742 --> 03:12:10.772
wearing some darkened studded leather vest

03:12:10.772 --> 03:12:12.592
over some billowing sleeved cloak,

03:12:12.592 --> 03:12:15.020
and he has a lute strung over his shoulder

03:12:15.020 --> 03:12:16.870
and a small cart that he's

03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:19.071
pulling behind him with a small pony.

03:12:19.071 --> 03:12:20.620
MARISHA: You said he's a gnome?

03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:21.453
MATT: He's a halfling.

03:12:21.453 --> 03:12:22.286
MARISHA: Halfling?

03:12:22.286 --> 03:12:23.182
Rockabilly halfling.

03:12:23.182 --> 03:12:24.015
Got it.

03:12:25.162 --> 03:12:26.282
I like you.

03:12:26.282 --> 03:12:28.780
You look like you know what I'm talking about.

03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:30.357
MATT: "I'd say I do."

03:12:30.357 --> 03:12:31.706
MARISHA: What do you got?

03:12:31.706 --> 03:12:33.339
MATT: "Well, I came prepared, you see.

03:12:33.339 --> 03:12:34.779
"I brought my own shit to go ahead and celebrate."

03:12:34.779 --> 03:12:36.469
MARISHA: You just get off one of these boats?

03:12:36.469 --> 03:12:37.867
MATT: "I did.

03:12:37.867 --> 03:12:39.367
"What's your name?"

03:12:40.532 --> 03:12:41.535
MARISHA: Jester.

03:12:42.582 --> 03:12:43.828
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:12:43.828 --> 03:12:44.820
SAM: What?

03:12:44.820 --> 03:12:46.179
TRAVIS: Wha- why?

03:12:46.179 --> 03:12:47.532
TALIESIN: What's your game here?
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:12:47.532 --> 03:12:48.984
I don't have one.

03:12:49.842 --> 03:12:50.992
Deception?

03:12:50.992 --> 03:12:52.682
LIAM: You're having fun.

03:12:52.682 --> 03:12:54.012
MARISHA: 19.

03:12:54.012 --> 03:12:54.845
MATT: He goes,

03:12:56.839 --> 03:12:59.969
"All right. My name's the Traveler."

03:12:59.969 --> 03:13:01.482
(laughter)

03:13:01.482 --> 03:13:02.315
MATT: "Welcome to my--"

03:13:02.315 --> 03:13:05.594
MARISHA: Hang on. Wait, is she that famous?

03:13:05.594 --> 03:13:07.339
Is she that well known?

03:13:07.339 --> 03:13:08.772
MATT: "I have no idea what you're talking about."

03:13:08.772 --> 03:13:09.755
MARISHA: Yeah. Me neither.

03:13:10.810 --> 03:13:11.939
(laughter)

03:13:11.939 --> 03:13:13.932
MATT: "Look, I was told there was going

03:13:13.932 --> 03:13:17.043
"to be a fucking party here."
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:13:17.043 --> 03:13:20.342
MATT: "So I brought a lot of things to do at the party.

03:13:20.342 --> 03:13:22.294
"And by that, I mean, this."

03:13:22.294 --> 03:13:23.772
He pulls the sheet back on the top,

03:13:23.772 --> 03:13:27.192
and you can see large, dark brown glass jugs

03:13:27.192 --> 03:13:29.662
of some sort of liquid.

03:13:29.662 --> 03:13:32.677
He goes, "I've got a lot of rum."

03:13:32.677 --> 03:13:34.237
MARISHA: I love you.

03:13:34.237 --> 03:13:35.812
MATT: "What's your name?"

03:13:35.812 --> 03:13:37.602
MARISHA: Beauregard. What's yours?

03:13:37.602 --> 03:13:38.982
MATT: "Kent Plucker."

03:13:38.982 --> 03:13:40.521
MARISHA: Kent Plucker?!

03:13:40.521 --> 03:13:41.958
LAURA: That's a great name.

03:13:41.958 --> 03:13:44.616
ASHLEY: What a great name!

03:13:44.616 --> 03:13:46.465
MATT: "Traveling lutesman.

03:13:46.465 --> 03:13:47.972
"I've been here. Been around the world,

03:13:47.972 --> 03:13:49.622
"and you know, seen a lot of things,

03:13:49.622 --> 03:13:51.239
"but this--
SAM: I've heard that name.

03:13:51.239 --> 03:13:53.429
MATT: He refers to the village around.

03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:54.882
"That's fucking weird."

03:13:54.882 --> 03:13:56.542
SAM: Yeah.

03:13:56.542 --> 03:13:58.165
MARISHA: Wait, what're you pointing at? What?

03:13:58.165 --> 03:14:00.165
MATT: "All of this."
SAM: I know who he is.

03:14:01.339 --> 03:14:02.769
MATT: "Anyway."

03:14:02.769 --> 03:14:04.372
MARISHA: You know who he is?

03:14:04.372 --> 03:14:06.009
SAM: He was part of Dr. Dranzel's--

03:14:06.009 --> 03:14:07.567
MARISHA: I wondering if he was part of--!
MATT: He was.

03:14:07.567 --> 03:14:10.000
LAURA: Oh my god, really?!
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:11.811
Kent Plucker.
SAM: Uh-huh.

03:14:11.811 --> 03:14:12.862
MARISHA: A lutesman.

03:14:12.862 --> 03:14:14.020
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:15.716
LAURA: Killer!

03:14:15.716 --> 03:14:16.672
ASHLEY: What?

03:14:16.672 --> 03:14:18.332
MATT: With your help he starts getting the large,

03:14:18.332 --> 03:14:19.562
heavy jugs of rum over,

03:14:19.562 --> 03:14:21.202
and between the two of you and some other aid,

03:14:21.202 --> 03:14:23.463
you begin setting up a bar area.

03:14:24.366 --> 03:14:27.209
MARISHA: Do we do owe you anything for this, man?

03:14:27.209 --> 03:14:29.812
MATT: "Oh, this is all part of my own appreciation,

03:14:29.812 --> 03:14:33.537
"and worship of the great Traveler."

03:14:33.537 --> 03:14:34.845
MARISHA: Uh huh.
MATT: "How'd you

03:14:34.845 --> 03:14:37.444
"come under his spell, if you will?"

03:14:37.444 --> 03:14:41.040
MARISHA: Oh, I am not into any of that bullshit.

03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:43.842
I'm really just helping

03:14:43.842 --> 03:14:46.995
a good friend of mine who I actually believe in.

03:14:47.942 --> 03:14:48.775
How about you?

03:14:48.775 --> 03:14:50.082
How'd you come into this shit?

03:14:51.729 --> 03:14:53.452
MATT: "Honestly, he just listened to a performance

03:14:53.452 --> 03:14:54.712
"I was doing said he liked it.

03:14:54.712 --> 03:14:55.892
"So we started talking music.

03:14:55.892 --> 03:14:57.510
"We wrote a little song together,

03:14:57.510 --> 03:15:00.492
"and then that's when it started."

03:15:00.492 --> 03:15:01.325
MARISHA: Wow.

03:15:01.325 --> 03:15:02.330
MATT: "Yeah."

03:15:02.330 --> 03:15:06.292
MARISHA: You're that easily persuaded. Okay, yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh <i>god</i>.

03:15:06.292 --> 03:15:07.125
SAM: Maybe Beau shouldn't be--

03:15:07.125 --> 03:15:08.812
MATT: "I can put all this right back in the cart,

03:15:08.812 --> 03:15:10.472
"and just take it to someone who appreciates it."

03:15:10.472 --> 03:15:14.291
MARISHA: No, no, no, I'm fascinated by this.

03:15:14.291 --> 03:15:15.749
SAM: Maybe she shouldn't be front of the house.

03:15:15.749 --> 03:15:16.932
MATT: "Don't get me wrong."

03:15:16.932 --> 03:15:18.412
TRAVIS: Customer service, not--

03:15:19.406 --> 03:15:20.565
MATT: He leans in and goes--

03:15:20.565 --> 03:15:22.992
TRAVIS: The shittiest concierge.

03:15:22.992 --> 03:15:24.302
"What are you doing here?"

03:15:24.302 --> 03:15:25.135
MARISHA: I'm not standing by the gate,

03:15:25.135 --> 03:15:26.143
and I'm setting up the bar.
LIAM: Is that what you're wearing?

03:15:26.143 --> 03:15:27.579
Two-- maybe.

03:15:27.579 --> 03:15:28.852
MATT: "Don't get me wrong.

03:15:28.852 --> 03:15:30.829
"I respect a hard ass."

03:15:30.829 --> 03:15:31.662
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:15:34.292 --> 03:15:36.597
Oh, are you wanting...? What?

03:15:36.597 --> 03:15:38.049
Are you wanting me to say something like,

03:15:38.049 --> 03:15:39.142
"Oh...

03:15:41.062 --> 03:15:42.632
"Traveler's great.

03:15:42.632 --> 03:15:44.249
"You're right. You got me."

03:15:46.279 --> 03:15:47.689
MATT: "Enjoy some of the rum."

03:15:49.322 --> 03:15:51.392
MARISHA: Thanks, Kent.

03:15:51.392 --> 03:15:52.722
MATT: Takes his lute off around his shoulder,

03:15:52.722 --> 03:15:54.900
and walks away plucking a little

03:15:54.900 --> 03:15:57.232
bit of a theme to himself.

03:15:58.243 --> 03:16:01.010
LIAM: (guitar)
TALIESIN: ♪ Kent Plucker ♪

03:16:01.010 --> 03:16:04.391
MARISHA: Got the bar stocked.
TRAVIS: ♪ Kent Plucker ♪

LAURA: ♪ More than meets the eye. ♪

03:16:10.669 --> 03:16:12.445
MATT: "That's a good solid tune.

03:16:12.445 --> 03:16:13.995
"I'll have to work on that one."

03:16:16.898 --> 03:16:18.331
All right.

03:16:18.331 --> 03:16:19.932
As this day progresses,

03:16:19.932 --> 03:16:22.952
you continue the path up that way.

03:16:22.952 --> 03:16:25.432
You begin to carry the rest of it to the top of the volcano,

03:16:25.432 --> 03:16:28.102
you're setting up the signs

03:16:28.102 --> 03:16:30.782
that make their way up in the symbol of what you requested.

03:16:30.782 --> 03:16:32.851
You set up a bar area.

03:16:32.851 --> 03:16:35.282
Fourth day comes to a close.

03:16:35.282 --> 03:16:36.732
LAURA: Can I ask...

03:16:37.732 --> 03:16:42.732
Does anybody else, is anybody else thinking about that

03:16:43.339 --> 03:16:47.512
that vision that Vo gave us?

03:16:47.512 --> 03:16:48.345
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:16:48.345 --> 03:16:50.803
SAM: That Vokodo?

03:16:50.803 --> 03:16:52.192
LAURA: Yeah.

03:16:52.192 --> 03:16:53.642
I mean, you guys saw it, too, right?

03:16:53.642 --> 03:16:57.612
That vision before he disappeared.

03:16:57.612 --> 03:17:00.342
Did you see that city thing?

03:17:00.342 --> 03:17:01.592
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:17:01.592 --> 03:17:03.310
MARISHA: I thought that was just me.

03:17:05.472 --> 03:17:09.932
LAURA: Did it seem terrible to anybody else?

03:17:09.932 --> 03:17:14.042
TRAVIS: Well, it just seems so abstract and alien.

03:17:14.042 --> 03:17:18.382
Like, I didn't really give it much thought.

03:17:18.382 --> 03:17:22.682
TALIESIN: I've been thinking about what to do about it,

03:17:22.682 --> 03:17:24.032
but it's...

03:17:25.812 --> 03:17:28.300
It's a big question I thought I would

03:17:28.300 --> 03:17:31.232
let you have your week before I--

03:17:31.232 --> 03:17:34.542
LAURA: Yeah, we should probably focus on this first.

03:17:34.542 --> 03:17:36.707
TALIESIN: I was going to--
LAURA: I just keep thinking about it.

03:17:36.707 --> 03:17:39.292
TALIESIN: I was going to mention, actually...

03:17:40.616 --> 03:17:43.092
It might be something worth asking the Traveler about.

03:17:43.092 --> 03:17:45.442
LAURA: I was planning on it as soon as he gets back.

03:17:46.657 --> 03:17:47.933
TALIESIN: I think it's a good idea.

03:17:47.933 --> 03:17:48.952
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:48.952 --> 03:17:50.975
TRAVIS: Well, do we think it's an actual threat?

03:17:50.975 --> 03:17:52.259
I thought--
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:17:52.259 --> 03:17:53.992
TRAVIS: -- that creature came from the Astral Sea,

03:17:53.992 --> 03:17:58.742
which is really, really not here.

03:17:58.742 --> 03:17:59.575
Right?

03:17:59.575 --> 03:18:03.472
LIAM: Yeah. It was an unsettling thing to experience, but...

03:18:04.412 --> 03:18:06.965
TALIESIN: I talked to the Wild Mother about it.

03:18:06.965 --> 03:18:08.095
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh.

03:18:08.095 --> 03:18:10.512
TALIESIN: And outside of...

03:18:11.972 --> 03:18:12.805
her...

03:18:14.722 --> 03:18:17.672
understanding, her ability

03:18:17.672 --> 03:18:19.342
to see what it is,

03:18:19.342 --> 03:18:22.075
but it is possible that it is--

03:18:23.022 --> 03:18:24.792
it might be coming here.

03:18:24.792 --> 03:18:27.512
It might-- it might know...

03:18:29.732 --> 03:18:30.832
it's entirely possible

03:18:30.832 --> 03:18:34.032
we even may have made too much noise.

03:18:34.032 --> 03:18:35.040
I don't know yet.

03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:36.702
TRAVIS: About what?!
TALIESIN: I've got other questions to ask.

03:18:36.702 --> 03:18:39.142
It's just my mind has been cloudy.

03:18:39.142 --> 03:18:43.982
LAURA: I wonder if when we sent Vo back if...

03:18:46.032 --> 03:18:48.724
if it gave

03:18:48.724 --> 03:18:52.722
visions of us to that thing,

03:18:52.722 --> 03:18:53.555
TALIESIN: Maybe.

03:18:53.555 --> 03:18:54.952
LAURA: I don't know.

03:18:54.952 --> 03:18:57.003
LIAM: Maybe, but there are so little that we know.

03:18:57.003 --> 03:18:59.456
It might've just been vestiges

03:18:59.456 --> 03:19:03.602
of Vokodo's fears or emotions.

03:19:03.602 --> 03:19:05.932
It fled where it came from.

03:19:05.932 --> 03:19:08.050
We don't know that it means anything.

03:19:08.050 --> 03:19:08.883
Yet.
TALIESIN: It may not.

03:19:08.883 --> 03:19:10.974
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You do believe that they were--

03:19:10.974 --> 03:19:14.722
They weren't immediate, you know,

03:19:14.722 --> 03:19:15.962
visions or premonitions.

03:19:15.962 --> 03:19:17.711
They were fragments of memory.

03:19:17.711 --> 03:19:19.010
LAURA: Memory.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:19:19.010 --> 03:19:20.093
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: There's something--

03:19:20.093 --> 03:19:22.842
there's a few things in there that do disturb me.

03:19:22.842 --> 03:19:24.675
I haven't been able to--

03:19:25.718 --> 03:19:26.551
hmm.

03:19:26.551 --> 03:19:28.582
MARISHA: Like, what?

03:19:30.082 --> 03:19:31.482
TALIESIN: Why was it running?

03:19:35.786 --> 03:19:37.119
Why the eyes?

03:19:40.102 --> 03:19:41.505
Why run here?

03:19:43.212 --> 03:19:44.722
TRAVIS: The eyes?

03:19:44.722 --> 03:19:45.555
LAURA: Yeah.

03:19:45.555 --> 03:19:48.237
Remember there was nine eyes.

03:19:48.237 --> 03:19:49.892
TALIESIN: Nine eyes.

03:19:49.892 --> 03:19:53.261
ASHLEY: Since we're talking about it,

03:19:53.261 --> 03:19:58.242
and now that we're realizing that we all had this vision.

03:19:59.512 --> 03:20:02.722
There's-- I don't know if there's any connection.

03:20:02.722 --> 03:20:04.819
I'm assuming that there is, but...

03:20:07.452 --> 03:20:09.592
Molly had nine eyes on him.

03:20:09.592 --> 03:20:10.512
It was, you know,

03:20:10.512 --> 03:20:13.582
so I wonder if there's some kind of connection.

03:20:13.582 --> 03:20:14.415
LAURA: Molly?

03:20:14.415 --> 03:20:15.833
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

03:20:15.833 --> 03:20:17.964
MARISHA: His tattoos.

03:20:17.964 --> 03:20:19.532
ASHLEY: Yeah, his tattoos.

03:20:19.532 --> 03:20:20.365
MARISHA: Beau just turns around

03:20:20.365 --> 03:20:24.572
and lifts up the replica of her seeing eye tattoo

03:20:24.572 --> 03:20:25.682
on the back of her neck.

03:20:25.682 --> 03:20:27.195
SAM: He had nine of those?

03:20:28.462 --> 03:20:30.145
ASHLEY: He had nine of them.

03:20:31.182 --> 03:20:34.502
SAM: Is that rooted in some sort of folklore --

03:20:34.502 --> 03:20:35.592
LAURA: Do we know anything about that?

03:20:35.592 --> 03:20:37.012
SAM: -- or religion or something?

03:20:37.012 --> 03:20:38.633
TALIESIN: Not that I know of.

03:20:38.633 --> 03:20:43.187
MARISHA: Would either of the Empire kids? The readers?

03:20:43.187 --> 03:20:47.447
MATT: If anybody has a proficiency in religion?

03:20:48.342 --> 03:20:49.712
MARISHA: I think I do.

03:20:49.712 --> 03:20:51.082
TALIESIN: I do, technically.

03:20:51.082 --> 03:20:54.355
MATT: Yeah. You guys can both roll.

03:20:54.355 --> 03:20:55.531
TALIESIN: This'll be comedy.

03:20:55.531 --> 03:20:57.020
MARISHA: Oh my god. This is going to suck.

03:20:57.020 --> 03:20:59.154
TALIESIN: (laughs) Five.

03:21:01.462 --> 03:21:03.044
MARISHA: Okay. 21.

03:21:03.044 --> 03:21:04.927
MATT: 21?
LAURA: It's not terrible.

03:21:05.832 --> 03:21:07.752
MATT: Nothing religious stems from--

03:21:07.752 --> 03:21:12.093
I mean, there is eye iconography in many religions.

03:21:12.093 --> 03:21:16.838
The Whispered One who attempted ascension

03:21:16.838 --> 03:21:18.982
two decades before had

03:21:18.982 --> 03:21:21.482
very much eye-in-hand iconography.

03:21:21.482 --> 03:21:26.302
The Knowing Mistress has the three eyes,

03:21:26.302 --> 03:21:27.312
and the Cobalt Soul.

03:21:27.312 --> 03:21:30.242
The design itself is based around the three eyes,

03:21:30.242 --> 03:21:34.362
but nothing in particular with a nine-eyed arrangement

03:21:34.362 --> 03:21:37.502
or anything similar to Molly's tattoo designs

03:21:37.502 --> 03:21:38.785
at the very least.

03:21:39.782 --> 03:21:41.282
You can roll an arcana check, if you'd like, as well.

03:21:41.282 --> 03:21:42.602
LIAM: Sure.

03:21:42.602 --> 03:21:45.252
MARISHA: Both of us, or just those who are trained?
MATT: Both of you guys, since you're the ones--

03:21:45.252 --> 03:21:47.177
Well, the ones who are trained in arcana.

03:21:47.177 --> 03:21:48.732
MARISHA: Go Caleb. Get it.
LIAM: Proficient in arcana.

03:21:48.732 --> 03:21:49.674
23.

03:21:49.674 --> 03:21:50.740
MATT: 23.

03:21:52.482 --> 03:21:54.890
Nothing catching your attention, either.

03:21:54.890 --> 03:21:58.232
LIAM: I mean, I know we like to apply meaning to things,

03:21:58.232 --> 03:21:59.792
and this might be meaningful,

03:21:59.792 --> 03:22:03.052
but this thing, this Eye of Nine.

03:22:03.052 --> 03:22:05.132
We are the Mighty Nein.

03:22:05.132 --> 03:22:08.408
Perhaps we are just jumping at shadows.

03:22:09.472 --> 03:22:11.832
SAM: Maybe, but didn't we also see, like,

03:22:11.832 --> 03:22:15.849
when we were going around with the whole Uk'otoa business.

03:22:15.849 --> 03:22:19.032
MARISHA and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.
SAM: Wasn't there three things?

03:22:19.032 --> 03:22:20.409
And there was three creatures?

03:22:20.409 --> 03:22:21.652
And they each have three,

03:22:21.652 --> 03:22:23.071
and that's three, and that's nine?

03:22:23.071 --> 03:22:24.504
MARISHA: The Worm and the Phoenix.

03:22:24.504 --> 03:22:27.482
LIAM: I mean, once you start picking at numerology,

03:22:27.482 --> 03:22:30.068
you can go forever.

03:22:30.068 --> 03:22:32.346
LAURA: I thought Uk'otoa had a whole bunch of eyes?

03:22:32.346 --> 03:22:33.462
MATT: Uk'otoa has many eyes.

03:22:33.462 --> 03:22:34.337
SAM and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa...

03:22:34.337 --> 03:22:35.286
TALIESIN: Greater truths.

03:22:35.286 --> 03:22:37.242
MARISHA: Would I know anything from my, like--

03:22:38.582 --> 03:22:39.742
TRAVIS: Cloven crystal.

03:22:39.742 --> 03:22:41.482
MARISHA: Anything from my...

03:22:41.482 --> 03:22:42.925
Deep Speech?

03:22:44.052 --> 03:22:45.372
Abyssal training?

03:22:45.372 --> 03:22:47.595
LIAM: I have proficiency in nines.

03:22:47.595 --> 03:22:48.711
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:22:49.772 --> 03:22:52.992
MATT: Technically you all have proficiency in Neins.

03:22:52.992 --> 03:22:54.092
Nothing.
MARISHA: No, nothing.

03:22:54.092 --> 03:22:55.823
MATT: Nothing.

03:22:55.823 --> 03:22:56.906
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:22:57.903 --> 03:22:59.036
Had to [inaudible].

03:22:59.036 --> 03:23:00.402
TALIESIN: Natural 20 into the darkness.

03:23:00.402 --> 03:23:01.772
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:23:01.772 --> 03:23:02.833
TALIESIN: Perfection.

03:23:02.833 --> 03:23:05.783
(laughter)

03:23:06.732 --> 03:23:08.212
You just say, "I killed a T-Rex,"

03:23:08.212 --> 03:23:10.339
and listen for a second.

03:23:12.352 --> 03:23:13.185
Sorry.

03:23:13.185 --> 03:23:15.262
TRAVIS: Silent fart.

03:23:15.262 --> 03:23:16.595
LAURA: Nobody knows.

03:23:17.702 --> 03:23:19.062
SAM: Well, we'll just...

03:23:20.312 --> 03:23:21.749
keep an eye out for it, I guess?

03:23:21.749 --> 03:23:23.202
TRAVIS: No, it's fine.

03:23:23.202 --> 03:23:26.372
LIAM: My impression of that happening was like a--

03:23:26.372 --> 03:23:27.705
an octopus in fear.

03:23:27.705 --> 03:23:32.387
When it flees, it just explodes out a cloud of ink

03:23:32.387 --> 03:23:36.529
into the water, and I felt like we were just getting clouded

03:23:36.529 --> 03:23:41.235
with his last fleeting terror, but--

03:23:41.235 --> 03:23:42.765
TALIESIN: I've been dreaming of it.

03:23:43.622 --> 03:23:44.692
TRAVIS: Repeatedly?

03:23:44.692 --> 03:23:47.275
TALIESIN: Yeah. It might just be stuck in my head,

03:23:47.275 --> 03:23:49.172
but it's...

03:23:50.322 --> 03:23:53.392
I haven't figured out what the right questions are yet.

03:23:53.392 --> 03:23:55.462
TRAVIS: Well, we don't plan on traveling there,

03:23:55.462 --> 03:23:59.152
and this creature, Vokodo, found its way here

03:23:59.152 --> 03:24:01.968
through that rift, right? The shard.

03:24:01.968 --> 03:24:04.167
LAURA: He created a rift.

03:24:04.167 --> 03:24:05.632
TALIESIN: He broke through.

03:24:05.632 --> 03:24:08.890
TRAVIS: Right. So are we thinking
that's going to be replicated?

03:24:08.890 --> 03:24:10.206
LAURA: (uncertain sound)

03:24:11.220 --> 03:24:14.082
LIAM: Very, very [inaudible] questions.
TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:24:14.082 --> 03:24:16.232
TRAVIS: How did he even do that in the first place?

03:24:16.232 --> 03:24:18.432
TALIESIN: How did they do it in the--

03:24:18.432 --> 03:24:20.002
How did he do it in the first place?

03:24:20.002 --> 03:24:20.835
He did.

03:24:21.938 --> 03:24:23.604
MARISHA: Why would that--
TALIESIN: Why would do it--

03:24:23.604 --> 03:24:25.362
Does he do it in the second places?

03:24:25.362 --> 03:24:29.012
MARISHA: Why would that sentient city chase him?

03:24:29.012 --> 03:24:29.845
To what end?

03:24:29.845 --> 03:24:30.772
TALIESIN: Why did you have a friend

03:24:30.772 --> 03:24:34.252
with nine eyes tattooed on himself?

03:24:35.586 --> 03:24:36.419
MARISHA: Yasha.

03:24:37.632 --> 03:24:39.982
You knew Molly better than any of us.

03:24:41.436 --> 03:24:42.592
Is there anything he mentioned?

03:24:42.592 --> 03:24:45.542
Anything that you can recall that he didn't tell us?

03:24:50.332 --> 03:24:51.979
ASHLEY: I know he didn't--

03:24:53.522 --> 03:24:55.939
he didn't know what those tattoos were.

03:24:57.782 --> 03:24:59.702
TRAVIS: He didn't know where they came from?

03:25:00.281 --> 03:25:01.114
ASHLEY: No,

03:25:03.331 --> 03:25:04.731
he tried to cover them, but.

03:25:07.461 --> 03:25:08.721
It never worked.

03:25:08.721 --> 03:25:09.914
So he just,

03:25:12.351 --> 03:25:14.741
became a canvas and added to them.

03:25:14.741 --> 03:25:16.652
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

03:25:16.652 --> 03:25:17.485
LAURA: Wow.

03:25:17.485 --> 03:25:19.264
MARISHA: He had that one in his hand.

03:25:20.541 --> 03:25:22.429
Remember the tattoo on his hand?

03:25:23.791 --> 03:25:25.801
And there was the eye in the peacock.

03:25:25.801 --> 03:25:28.871
And one on his neck.
LAURA: What was his past life?

03:25:28.871 --> 03:25:30.702
MARISHA: He doesn't even remember,

03:25:32.031 --> 03:25:34.291
unless there was something he wasn't telling us.

03:25:34.291 --> 03:25:36.541
TRAVIS: All right, let's go get Molly.

03:25:37.375 --> 03:25:38.583
LAURA: Maybe we should.

03:25:39.728 --> 03:25:41.751
TRAVIS: I'm only half-joking.

03:25:41.751 --> 03:25:44.651
Later, though. We have so much we're doing here, right?

03:25:44.651 --> 03:25:47.211
LAURA: Yeah, Traveler Con, you guys.

03:25:47.211 --> 03:25:50.001
SAM: Yeah, it's now. This is it.

03:25:50.001 --> 03:25:51.480
We got to go.

03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:52.779
LAURA: We've got one more day.

03:25:52.779 --> 03:25:55.681
ASHLEY: Maybe we circle back to this when this is--

03:25:55.681 --> 03:25:57.331
LAURA: How many more days?

03:25:57.331 --> 03:26:00.131
MATT: We'll say two full days before the actual event.

03:26:06.061 --> 03:26:07.651
LAURA: Pleasant dreams, everyone.

03:26:07.651 --> 03:26:09.271
SAM: Good night.

03:26:09.271 --> 03:26:11.001
TRAVIS: I feel great about our progress.

03:26:11.001 --> 03:26:12.901
TRAVIS: This is very encouraging.
LAURA: I think it's coming along

03:26:12.901 --> 03:26:14.761
really well, honestly.

03:26:14.761 --> 03:26:17.514
Thank you guys for everything you're doing

03:26:18.901 --> 03:26:23.006
and don't forget, you're
representatives of the Traveler, okay?

03:26:23.006 --> 03:26:24.431
SAM: Is there a thing that we say?

03:26:24.431 --> 03:26:25.611
Have we decided on that?

03:26:25.611 --> 03:26:27.301
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.
LAURA: Oh.

03:26:27.301 --> 03:26:30.271
Let the chaos enter your heart.

03:26:30.271 --> 03:26:32.881
Let your chaos be your guide.

03:26:32.881 --> 03:26:33.714
SAM: Shorten it.

03:26:33.714 --> 03:26:34.951
Let chaos be your guide?

03:26:34.951 --> 03:26:36.292
That's good. Okay, cool.
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

03:26:36.292 --> 03:26:37.981
MARISHA: We're supposed to be saying that to people?

03:26:37.981 --> 03:26:40.241
TRAVIS: And we've had nothing but positive interactions

03:26:40.241 --> 03:26:42.391
with the guests coming to the island, right?

03:26:42.391 --> 03:26:47.031
Everyone feeling welcome and, you know, nurtured.

03:26:47.031 --> 03:26:48.501
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:26:48.501 --> 03:26:50.781
MARISHA: So many friends.
LAURA: Cool.

03:26:50.781 --> 03:26:52.101
SAM: Also.

03:26:52.101 --> 03:26:55.634
Don't point like this; that's offensive in some cultures.

03:26:55.634 --> 03:26:57.209
MARISHA: Oh, right. You have to do the--

03:26:57.209 --> 03:27:00.901
SAM: Like a this.
TRAVIS: Oh yes, gestures to-- never to the food.

03:27:00.901 --> 03:27:01.742
TALIESIN: Four finger.

03:27:01.742 --> 03:27:03.561
LIAM: I always do the fist over the thumb.

03:27:03.561 --> 03:27:06.511
TRAVIS: It's never "Not a problem," it's "My pleasure."

03:27:06.511 --> 03:27:08.044
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

03:27:08.044 --> 03:27:09.435
TRAVIS: Don't mention the problem.

03:27:09.435 --> 03:27:10.268
LAURA: Right, right, right.

03:27:10.268 --> 03:27:11.651
TALIESIN: Don't do that if you're holding one of the dicks,

03:27:11.651 --> 03:27:14.731
that just gets weird.
(laughter)

03:27:14.731 --> 03:27:17.141
LAURA: Or maybe do do that because...

03:27:17.141 --> 03:27:17.998
TRAVIS: You said doo-doo.

03:27:17.998 --> 03:27:20.271
LAURA: I did, (laughs).
SAM: Do do that.

03:27:20.271 --> 03:27:22.092
LIAM: Chaos reign.

03:27:22.092 --> 03:27:25.671
(laughter)

03:27:25.671 --> 03:27:28.271
SAM: That's, like, this,

03:27:28.271 --> 03:27:30.388
of this faith.
LIAM: Chaos reign.

03:27:30.388 --> 03:27:31.221
Chaos reign.

03:27:32.878 --> 03:27:35.232
TALIESIN: Best secret hand wave ever.

03:27:35.232 --> 03:27:38.143
(laughter)

03:27:38.143 --> 03:27:38.996
TRAVIS: Oh no.

03:27:38.996 --> 03:27:40.072
(laughter)

03:27:40.072 --> 03:27:40.913
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:27:40.913 --> 03:27:42.679
TRAVIS: Let the chaos reign.
SAM: And also with you.

03:27:42.679 --> 03:27:46.369
(laughter)

03:27:46.369 --> 03:27:47.202
MATT: So.

03:27:47.202 --> 03:27:49.760
(laughter)

03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:53.401
The next couple of days are eventful in the sense that

03:27:53.401 --> 03:27:57.501
numerous people begin to arrive ship after ship.

03:27:57.501 --> 03:28:01.447
Some, not ships, some magically transport,

03:28:01.447 --> 03:28:06.447
but you have, the day before
the actual date of Traveler Con,

03:28:06.741 --> 03:28:10.024
over a hundred individuals arriving.

03:28:11.841 --> 03:28:14.791
The village is now more bustling than it's ever been.

03:28:14.791 --> 03:28:17.611
Personalities are tense and clashing in some places

03:28:17.611 --> 03:28:19.951
while new friendships are forging around.

03:28:19.951 --> 03:28:22.231
Many loud voices, boisterous, people excited,

03:28:22.231 --> 03:28:24.051
talking about and pointing at the various elements that

03:28:24.051 --> 03:28:25.151
have been prepared here.

03:28:25.151 --> 03:28:27.351
People looking at the archway above

03:28:27.351 --> 03:28:29.931
and some artists doing sketches and, you know,

03:28:29.931 --> 03:28:32.861
element looks like rubs against parts of

03:28:32.861 --> 03:28:36.261
the iconography that's been sculpted into the nearby wood.

03:28:36.261 --> 03:28:39.331
The villagers who've remained, look a little overwhelmed,

03:28:39.331 --> 03:28:40.751
but are trying their best.

03:28:40.751 --> 03:28:42.571
People are having to room together in groups,

03:28:42.571 --> 03:28:43.791
because chambers that were once built

03:28:43.791 --> 03:28:45.321
for one or two individuals,

03:28:45.321 --> 03:28:48.351
are now having to house four or five, to keep people,

03:28:48.351 --> 03:28:52.951
you know, comfortably prepared for the day as it arrives.

03:28:52.951 --> 03:28:54.431
You finish the remainder of your preparations,

03:28:54.431 --> 03:28:58.986
as the final groups are sent on their way via Vilya,

03:28:59.981 --> 03:29:01.574
as the,

03:29:02.581 --> 03:29:06.944
the eve hits before-- let's say Traveler Con Eve

03:29:08.141 --> 03:29:09.551
is upon you.

03:29:09.551 --> 03:29:12.113
And you guys are taking a moment to take in

03:29:12.113 --> 03:29:14.361
the voices, the lights, the colors.

03:29:14.361 --> 03:29:15.801
People have brought their own decorations,

03:29:15.801 --> 03:29:20.021
their own outfits, their own, you know, cloaks.

03:29:20.021 --> 03:29:21.646
(laughter)

03:29:21.646 --> 03:29:23.761
SAM: Giant swords.
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:29:23.761 --> 03:29:24.727
MATT: All piece bonded.

03:29:24.727 --> 03:29:28.161
LAURA: We should definitely have some music playing.

03:29:28.161 --> 03:29:31.531
MATT: There are musicians who are here that are playing.

03:29:31.531 --> 03:29:32.364
It is--

03:29:33.531 --> 03:29:36.591
you gather it is the type of chaos the Traveler would

03:29:36.591 --> 03:29:37.804
be appreciative of.

03:29:38.981 --> 03:29:41.141
And into the evening--

03:29:41.141 --> 03:29:42.631
Actually to that point,

03:29:42.631 --> 03:29:46.121
I'm going to go ahead and because it seems right for this.

03:29:46.121 --> 03:29:47.971
LIAM: And this is Traveler's Eve, right?

03:29:47.971 --> 03:29:48.804
MATT: This is Traveler's Eve.

03:29:48.804 --> 03:29:49.637
SAM: All Traveler's Eve.

03:29:49.637 --> 03:29:52.126
MATT: All Traveler's Eve. (laughs)

03:29:52.126 --> 03:29:53.499
(festival music)
LAURA: Awesome!

03:29:53.499 --> 03:29:54.715
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:29:54.715 --> 03:29:56.108
MATT: As this is happening and you guys are

03:29:56.108 --> 03:29:57.655
ducked off just out of sight,

03:29:57.655 --> 03:29:59.063
taking in the space around you,

03:29:59.063 --> 03:30:01.791
the anxiety building in your chest a little bit,

03:30:01.791 --> 03:30:06.201
a couple of footsteps arise and a familiar red-haired figure

03:30:06.201 --> 03:30:09.021
saunters up and goes, "Well, I have to say,

03:30:09.021 --> 03:30:11.102
"this is rather impressive."

03:30:13.314 --> 03:30:15.581
LAURA: Are you going to let everyone know you're here or--?

03:30:15.581 --> 03:30:17.398
MATT: "No, no. I'm keeping a low profile.

03:30:18.251 --> 03:30:19.084
"Trust me.

03:30:20.764 --> 03:30:22.499
"What was the phrase again?"

03:30:23.681 --> 03:30:26.439
ALL: Let chaos reign.

03:30:26.439 --> 03:30:28.089
MATT: "Let chaos reign!

03:30:29.311 --> 03:30:30.453
"They don't see me that way."

03:30:30.453 --> 03:30:33.651
Everyone just waves and goes walking.

03:30:33.651 --> 03:30:36.521
LAURA: No one's ever seen you the way you actually are?

03:30:36.521 --> 03:30:38.591
MATT: "Well, only you're seeing my true form.

03:30:38.591 --> 03:30:40.411
"I'm putting a glamor up for everybody else."

03:30:40.411 --> 03:30:41.481
LAURA: Oh wow!

03:30:41.481 --> 03:30:42.687
TRAVIS: There's people killing each other over

03:30:42.687 --> 03:30:44.581
on the other side of the square.

03:30:44.581 --> 03:30:46.434
MARISHA: My fighting pit is working!

03:30:46.434 --> 03:30:47.468
TRAVIS: Those numbers are going down now.

03:30:47.468 --> 03:30:49.292
MATT: "That was inspired.

03:30:49.292 --> 03:30:51.116
"I'm excited to see what comes out of that.

03:30:52.831 --> 03:30:54.331
"So what's the final plan?

03:30:54.331 --> 03:30:55.431
"We have most everyone here,

03:30:55.431 --> 03:30:57.014
"a couple of stragglers coming in tonight.

03:30:57.014 --> 03:31:00.791
"I've guided most all of the ducks to the event,

03:31:00.791 --> 03:31:05.791
"and I am beyond excited and extremely proud, Jester."

03:31:06.631 --> 03:31:10.221
LAURA: I'm so glad. Well, we'll see how tomorrow goes.

03:31:10.221 --> 03:31:11.724
See how proud you are then.

03:31:12.909 --> 03:31:15.081
So tomorrow, I figure, you know,

03:31:15.081 --> 03:31:18.531
we'll start the day off with a big musical concert,

03:31:18.531 --> 03:31:21.221
you know, get everybody together in the square.

03:31:21.221 --> 03:31:23.644
MARISHA: Oh my god. Are you going to do a keynote speech?

03:31:23.644 --> 03:31:25.369
LAURA: Yeah, I'll announce the dick hunt.

03:31:25.369 --> 03:31:27.103
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Yeah.

03:31:27.103 --> 03:31:30.151
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Are people in the craft area?

03:31:30.151 --> 03:31:33.371
Are they beating the-- are they carving their dicks?

03:31:33.371 --> 03:31:35.021
Have we been doing that this whole time?

03:31:35.021 --> 03:31:37.451
MATT: Oh yeah. No, there are plenty of dicks being carved.

03:31:37.451 --> 03:31:39.931
There are whole families that are over there,

03:31:39.931 --> 03:31:41.566
doing it as a communal event.

03:31:41.566 --> 03:31:43.721
(laughter)

03:31:43.721 --> 03:31:46.991
LIAM: A sign out front that just says, "Come whittle dicks!"

03:31:46.991 --> 03:31:47.824
MARISHA: A little how-to.

03:31:47.824 --> 03:31:49.207
TRAVIS: Come, widdle dicks!

03:31:49.207 --> 03:31:52.184
(laughter)

03:31:52.184 --> 03:31:53.017
LIAM: Yep.

03:31:54.242 --> 03:31:56.475
TRAVIS: Jesus. This is totally a kid's show.

03:31:56.475 --> 03:31:57.691
MATT: Totally, totally.

03:31:59.324 --> 03:32:00.173
TALIESIN: Family fun.

03:32:00.173 --> 03:32:01.006
TRAVIS: Man.

03:32:02.561 --> 03:32:04.886
MATT: "Well, my responsibilities

03:32:04.886 --> 03:32:06.711
"shall come to a close tonight

03:32:06.711 --> 03:32:08.511
"with all of them being shepherded here,

03:32:08.511 --> 03:32:12.391
"I've done my part until tomorrow's performance.

03:32:12.391 --> 03:32:16.633
"Then when that is done, they'll be free

03:32:16.633 --> 03:32:18.301
"and we'll be free."

03:32:18.301 --> 03:32:19.268
LAURA: Just me and you?

03:32:19.268 --> 03:32:20.521
MATT: "You and me."

03:32:20.521 --> 03:32:21.537
LAURA: I love it.

03:32:23.521 --> 03:32:24.671
MATT: "Couple of other people."

03:32:24.671 --> 03:32:26.160
LAURA: Nah, fuck them.
MATT: "But you're my favorite."

03:32:26.160 --> 03:32:27.085
LAURA: Okay, good.

03:32:29.621 --> 03:32:30.804
MATT: "Are you all ready?"

03:32:32.411 --> 03:32:33.444
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:32:33.444 --> 03:32:34.277
MARISHA: Whatever.

03:32:34.277 --> 03:32:36.585
SAM: We're all fueled up on dinosaur meat

03:32:36.585 --> 03:32:38.621
and ready to go, yeah.

03:32:38.621 --> 03:32:40.161
MATT: "All right.

03:32:40.161 --> 03:32:41.346
"I guess I should

03:32:42.731 --> 03:32:44.761
"show my appreciation for all the work you've done.

03:32:44.761 --> 03:32:48.694
"Both in being friends and aides to

03:32:48.694 --> 03:32:52.469
"Jester in her journeys and personal growth

"and to helping myself with this endeavor.

03:32:56.241 --> 03:32:59.521
"I can gather that not all of you are fans of me

03:32:59.521 --> 03:33:00.641
"and that's fine.

03:33:00.641 --> 03:33:02.707
"I get it, few are,

03:33:04.483 --> 03:33:06.241
"but nevertheless,

03:33:06.241 --> 03:33:07.724
"I'm appreciative.

03:33:09.770 --> 03:33:11.481
"You all have cloaks, right?"

03:33:11.481 --> 03:33:12.554
SAM: Cloaks?

03:33:12.554 --> 03:33:14.520
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, I made cloaks for everybody.
MARISHA: We got them.

03:33:14.520 --> 03:33:15.633
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:33:15.633 --> 03:33:16.633
MATT: "Very well.

03:33:19.366 --> 03:33:21.051
"Thank you.

03:33:21.051 --> 03:33:23.761
"Do you need anything of me this evening?"

03:33:23.761 --> 03:33:26.501
LAURA: Can I talk to you for just a second?

03:33:26.501 --> 03:33:27.551
MATT: "Of course."

03:33:27.551 --> 03:33:29.374
LAURA: Can we walk away?

03:33:30.249 --> 03:33:32.736
(laughs) I love that you guys actually brought yours.

03:33:34.009 --> 03:33:35.652
MARISHA: I've been waiting for this moment.

03:33:37.461 --> 03:33:39.735
MATT: "See you all around,"

03:33:39.735 --> 03:33:42.991
and walks with you into the village, actually.

03:33:42.991 --> 03:33:44.884
LAURA: Oh! Well.

03:33:45.911 --> 03:33:47.256
MATT: "Unless you needed privacy.

03:33:47.256 --> 03:33:49.377
LAURA: No, no, no, I mean, this is fine.

03:33:52.471 --> 03:33:54.154
I dunno. I guess I just--

03:33:55.261 --> 03:33:57.581
it's all built up to this day

03:33:57.581 --> 03:34:00.041
and I just want to tell you

03:34:01.551 --> 03:34:04.601
how glad I am that

03:34:04.601 --> 03:34:05.868
you're here

03:34:09.388 --> 03:34:11.722
and that I'm proud of you.

03:34:13.581 --> 03:34:14.894
I know that,

03:34:16.341 --> 03:34:17.174
you know,

03:34:18.451 --> 03:34:20.621
you're saying you are just bored

03:34:20.621 --> 03:34:22.781
of having everybody worship you, but

03:34:24.821 --> 03:34:29.361
I think it's really great that you're

03:34:29.361 --> 03:34:30.521
letting everyone

03:34:32.531 --> 03:34:33.772
move on.

03:34:37.448 --> 03:34:38.698
MATT: (chuckles)

03:34:40.541 --> 03:34:43.797
"I would say reserve such--

03:34:43.797 --> 03:34:45.064
"Don't get me wrong, I'm very appreciative

03:34:45.064 --> 03:34:46.314
"of your appreciation.

03:34:48.131 --> 03:34:50.591
"I do have a weak spot for flattery.

03:34:50.591 --> 03:34:51.658
"You're not wrong,

03:34:52.901 --> 03:34:56.391
"but I mean, as much as I've guided you through the years,

03:34:56.391 --> 03:34:58.361
"don't think you haven't guided me.

03:34:58.361 --> 03:35:00.311
"And this is an example of that as well.

03:35:01.661 --> 03:35:04.205
"I'm happy to have found a path,

03:35:04.205 --> 03:35:07.963
"but truth be told,

03:35:07.963 --> 03:35:09.979
"maybe I need a bit of guidance myself.

03:35:11.371 --> 03:35:14.127
"I'm a selfish creature by nature."

03:35:16.271 --> 03:35:17.838
LAURA: And I love that about you.

03:35:19.061 --> 03:35:21.021
MATT: "I've watched you grow up

03:35:21.021 --> 03:35:22.046
"into something...

03:35:24.091 --> 03:35:25.084
"quite impactful.

03:35:26.783 --> 03:35:29.691
"It's going to change those around you for the better.

03:35:31.111 --> 03:35:33.084
"Well, those that matter anyway.

03:35:33.084 --> 03:35:34.241
"The others you'll leave screaming

03:35:34.241 --> 03:35:36.141
"and kicking and extremely confused,

03:35:36.141 --> 03:35:39.031
"which is how, in my opinion,

03:35:39.031 --> 03:35:41.131
"the best interactions should end."

03:35:43.141 --> 03:35:44.502
LAURA: You taught me well.

03:35:44.502 --> 03:35:48.181
MATT: "Well, this isn't an end of anything necessarily.

03:35:48.181 --> 03:35:49.381
"This is a new beginning.

03:35:51.891 --> 03:35:52.724
"We've been

03:35:54.041 --> 03:35:56.091
"partners for a very long time.

03:35:58.451 --> 03:36:00.301
"Look how much you've done without me.

03:36:02.681 --> 03:36:03.514
"Right?"

03:36:04.506 --> 03:36:05.406
LAURA: Yeah.

03:36:07.441 --> 03:36:09.622
MATT: "Look how much of a mess I've made without you.

03:36:09.622 --> 03:36:12.047
LAURA: (giggles) Yeah.

03:36:14.451 --> 03:36:18.434
MATT: "Just know that I'm always

03:36:18.434 --> 03:36:21.011
"around to the best of my ability."

03:36:21.011 --> 03:36:23.181
LAURA: I know, and I believe you.

03:36:27.071 --> 03:36:28.467
MATT: "But whatever strength I've been giving you,

03:36:28.467 --> 03:36:31.991
"it's just been more of a boost,

03:36:34.961 --> 03:36:35.871
"because believe me,

03:36:35.871 --> 03:36:38.025
"I've given similar gifts to many of these people, and

03:36:38.025 --> 03:36:39.911
"(scoffs) well, look at them."

03:36:39.911 --> 03:36:40.744
As you glance around,

03:36:40.744 --> 03:36:42.911
you see a bunch of drunken buffoons

03:36:42.911 --> 03:36:45.684
and people that are,

03:36:48.171 --> 03:36:49.391
I mean, not--

03:36:49.391 --> 03:36:50.451
they're all messes in the same way

03:36:50.451 --> 03:36:51.381
that all of you are messes,

03:36:51.381 --> 03:36:52.414
but they--

03:36:54.251 --> 03:36:55.451
I don't know.

03:36:55.451 --> 03:36:59.541
They lack more of a real purpose,

03:36:59.541 --> 03:37:02.761
at least in the moment that he's showing them in the throes

03:37:02.761 --> 03:37:03.941
of a celebration and a party,

03:37:03.941 --> 03:37:06.041
which maybe isn't the best example, but...

03:37:08.351 --> 03:37:11.259
"Not everyone takes the freedom

03:37:11.259 --> 03:37:13.608
"and the guidance that I offer and

03:37:15.079 --> 03:37:18.648
"I don't know, twists the world with it the right way.

03:37:23.291 --> 03:37:25.481
"There's too much stuffiness,

03:37:25.481 --> 03:37:27.554
"too much self-aggrandizing.

03:37:29.241 --> 03:37:32.181
"Seems that mortality leads people to

03:37:34.541 --> 03:37:37.441
"feel like they're rushing to some end."

03:37:37.441 --> 03:37:39.604
LAURA: Yeah, it does.

03:37:40.688 --> 03:37:43.138
Maybe you should make me immortal.

03:37:43.138 --> 03:37:46.801
MATT: (chuckles)

03:37:46.801 --> 03:37:47.841
"Sorry. I didn't mean to laugh so hard.

03:37:47.841 --> 03:37:49.174
"It was just quite funny to me."

03:37:51.031 --> 03:37:51.864
"But no,

03:37:54.741 --> 03:37:56.499
"very few individuals know how to

03:37:58.283 --> 03:38:01.408
"pull the rug out from under the world around them

03:38:01.408 --> 03:38:03.746
"and still leave them smiling.

03:38:04.761 --> 03:38:06.266
"That's what I want.

03:38:06.266 --> 03:38:08.371
"I don't want to hurt anyone.

03:38:08.371 --> 03:38:09.727
"Not intentionally.

03:38:11.021 --> 03:38:13.741
"And those that I do hurt,

03:38:13.741 --> 03:38:16.668
"well, I do feel a little bad."

03:38:16.668 --> 03:38:17.501
LAURA: See!

03:38:17.501 --> 03:38:19.892
MATT: "But doesn't tragedy build character?"
LAURA: You're growing.

03:38:19.892 --> 03:38:22.043
MATT: "Doesn't tragedy build character?"

03:38:22.043 --> 03:38:23.429
LAURA: It does. It does.

03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:27.954
But still when we first met, you didn't ever feel bad.

03:38:29.242 --> 03:38:30.971
MATT: "I still don't feel bad most of the time,

03:38:30.971 --> 03:38:33.774
"but you've grown on me, you're not wrong."

03:38:33.774 --> 03:38:35.341
LAURA: Artie?

03:38:35.341 --> 03:38:36.174
MATT: "Yes?"

03:38:37.801 --> 03:38:39.001
LAURA: You're my best friend.

03:38:40.221 --> 03:38:42.121
And no matter what you always will be.

03:38:44.101 --> 03:38:44.934
MATT: "For now."

03:38:47.421 --> 03:38:49.664
LAURA: Can I grab both sides of his face?
MATT: Sure.

03:38:49.664 --> 03:38:51.831
LAURA: I'm going to lean in like I'm going to kiss him.

03:38:51.831 --> 03:38:53.021
MATT: He looks a bit confused.

03:38:53.021 --> 03:38:55.583
LAURA: I'm going to bite his nose.

03:38:55.583 --> 03:38:57.666
MATT: (laughs)

03:38:59.991 --> 03:39:02.586
As it happens, he (grunts) pulls back a bit.

03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:06.433
"Hmm.

03:39:08.241 --> 03:39:09.616
"What the hell is that?"

03:39:09.616 --> 03:39:11.851
He looks over your shoulder, extremely worried.

03:39:11.851 --> 03:39:14.101
LAURA: Hmm. All right.

03:39:15.491 --> 03:39:16.324
MATT: He's gone.

03:39:16.324 --> 03:39:18.271
LAURA: Yeah. I knew it.

03:39:18.271 --> 03:39:19.191
MATT: You take a step and he kicks

03:39:19.191 --> 03:39:20.815
the back of your knee out from under you.

03:39:20.815 --> 03:39:22.354
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:39:22.354 --> 03:39:23.745
LAURA: (groans)

03:39:25.457 --> 03:39:28.031
Yeah. Yeah.

03:39:28.031 --> 03:39:29.439
TRAVIS: The asshole Batman.

03:39:31.341 --> 03:39:32.881
TALIESIN: (Batman voice) Got to turn around.

03:39:32.881 --> 03:39:35.201
MATT: "I've lived a very long time.

03:39:35.201 --> 03:39:37.451
"I've made many friends and lost many friends.

03:39:38.311 --> 03:39:40.434
"So I don't expect things to always last.

03:39:41.521 --> 03:39:45.101
"With the time that I have, I've learned to appreciate it.

03:39:45.101 --> 03:39:46.234
"The temporary things.

03:39:48.492 --> 03:39:52.151
"I mean, there's a good chance that
even I'm not as eternal as I believe.

03:39:52.151 --> 03:39:54.231
"When things are temporary

03:39:54.231 --> 03:39:58.321
"and you know it and you understand it, you truly savor it.

03:40:01.401 --> 03:40:04.334
"So even we might be temporary.

03:40:06.011 --> 03:40:07.834
"So let us appreciate the time we have."

03:40:09.241 --> 03:40:10.074
LAURA: Okay.

03:40:11.143 --> 03:40:13.214
MATT: "Well, I'm going to have a drink.
LAURA: Do it!

03:40:13.214 --> 03:40:16.461
MATT: "Revel with these idiots for the last time,"

03:40:17.891 --> 03:40:19.391
and he saunters off into the crowd,

03:40:19.391 --> 03:40:20.461
which is weird from your perspective,

03:40:20.461 --> 03:40:22.213
because they all worship him

03:40:22.213 --> 03:40:23.201
and he just walks in the middle,

03:40:23.201 --> 03:40:24.753
but they all treat him just like another one of

03:40:24.753 --> 03:40:27.114
the people there, because they do not see the Traveler.

03:40:34.338 --> 03:40:36.271
LAURA: I'll make my way back to the group.

03:40:36.271 --> 03:40:37.104
MATT: Okay.

03:40:43.761 --> 03:40:44.594
LAURA: Wow.

03:40:45.991 --> 03:40:47.204
You guys ready for this?

03:40:49.151 --> 03:40:53.521
LIAM: Still not entirely sure what this will be, but--

03:40:54.681 --> 03:40:56.724
LAURA: Me neither.

03:40:58.001 --> 03:41:00.524
I say we start tomorrow, not bright and early.

03:41:01.461 --> 03:41:03.801
Who wants to wake up after all of this alcohol,

03:41:03.801 --> 03:41:05.881
bright and early and travel up a volcano?

03:41:05.881 --> 03:41:07.821
We should do it towards the evening.

03:41:07.821 --> 03:41:09.997
MARISHA: No one goes to 9:00am panels.

03:41:09.997 --> 03:41:11.561
LAURA: No.

03:41:11.561 --> 03:41:15.251
TRAVIS: We didn't really set up a security team, did we?

03:41:15.251 --> 03:41:18.564
As the night gets a little longer and more crazy,

03:41:19.451 --> 03:41:23.697
should we be, I don't know, keeping an eye on the frivolity?

03:41:25.494 --> 03:41:27.071
LAURA: We'll keep an eye.

03:41:27.071 --> 03:41:30.601
SAM: I mean, aren't we supposed to let chaos reign?

03:41:30.601 --> 03:41:32.086
TRAVIS: I mean, yeah, but.

03:41:35.171 --> 03:41:36.924
SAM: Can't do that safely, can you?

03:41:39.581 --> 03:41:41.831
TRAVIS: I don't know if I have the answer to that question.

03:41:41.831 --> 03:41:42.805
MARISHA: Safety third.

03:41:42.805 --> 03:41:44.598
TRAVIS: Safety third, yes.

03:41:44.598 --> 03:41:45.431
Then no.

03:41:45.431 --> 03:41:47.321
SAM: I guess we can just keep an eye on things.

03:41:47.321 --> 03:41:48.931
Make sure nobody kills each other.

03:41:48.931 --> 03:41:51.583
MARISHA: I mean, yeah, I'm not going to bed anytime soon.

03:41:51.583 --> 03:41:52.416
LAURA: Yeah.

03:41:53.391 --> 03:41:55.850
MARISHA: I think going to bartend for a few hours,

03:41:55.850 --> 03:41:57.024
because that's funny.
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

03:41:57.024 --> 03:41:58.690
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think we should just let it happen.

03:42:00.811 --> 03:42:04.001
MARISHA: Also, I gave Treece,
like, five more bottle rockets.

03:42:04.001 --> 03:42:06.594
So that's going to be really funny in about 10 minutes.

03:42:08.651 --> 03:42:10.401
TALIESIN: Think people might get violent?

03:42:12.231 --> 03:42:13.064
LAURA: They might.

03:42:14.431 --> 03:42:17.926
MARISHA: I did build a fight/dance ring.

03:42:19.585 --> 03:42:21.002
TALIESIN: I feel like that's at least

03:42:21.002 --> 03:42:22.611
putting some boundaries on things.

03:42:22.611 --> 03:42:24.121
MARISHA: That's true.

03:42:24.121 --> 03:42:25.321
LAURA: I'm going to go dance.

03:42:26.871 --> 03:42:29.254
SAM: Is Vilya still here?

03:42:30.661 --> 03:42:31.511
MATT: Vilya is still here.

03:42:31.511 --> 03:42:33.091
And actually, as you guys are having this conversation,

03:42:33.091 --> 03:42:35.437
you glance over and you can see as everyone's partying,

03:42:35.437 --> 03:42:37.871
sitting at one of the tables in the outskirts of

03:42:37.871 --> 03:42:42.351
the group, talking to no one, is Vilya, with a cup,

03:42:42.351 --> 03:42:44.361
just holding it, staff leaning against the table,

03:42:44.361 --> 03:42:46.341
looking down into it.

03:42:46.341 --> 03:42:47.954
SAM: I'll go over and say hi.

03:42:49.941 --> 03:42:51.951
MATT: "Oh, hello."

03:42:51.951 --> 03:42:53.479
SAM: Hey, what--

03:42:54.481 --> 03:42:57.991
Have you finished your--?

03:42:59.005 --> 03:43:01.689
MATT: (sighs) "I guess I have."

03:43:02.991 --> 03:43:05.551
SAM: Were you going to stick around

03:43:05.551 --> 03:43:08.441
for tomorrow or do you think you're done?

03:43:08.441 --> 03:43:11.156
I mean, this is, we don't really know what

03:43:11.156 --> 03:43:12.781
this party's going to be and

03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:16.107
you know, we're set.

03:43:16.107 --> 03:43:19.175
So if you wanted to go, that would be okay.

03:43:20.261 --> 03:43:22.115
MATT: Suddenly the area you guys are in get shoved

03:43:22.115 --> 03:43:23.623
a little bit and you can see there's

03:43:23.623 --> 03:43:24.711
a younger couple who were here,

03:43:24.711 --> 03:43:26.444
both laughing and just start making out,

03:43:26.444 --> 03:43:29.146
leaning against the table before stumbling off that way

03:43:29.146 --> 03:43:30.371
and Vilya goes,

03:43:31.751 --> 03:43:36.224
"I'm not sure if these frivolities are really my scene."

03:43:38.301 --> 03:43:39.331
SAM: Yeah.

03:43:39.331 --> 03:43:40.514
Well, listen,

03:43:41.501 --> 03:43:43.071
I've been meaning to talk to you about this,

03:43:43.071 --> 03:43:47.872
but, like, you have a kid out there somewhere, right?

03:43:50.611 --> 03:43:52.306
MATT: "I think so, yeah."

03:43:53.291 --> 03:43:56.486
SAM: And you must be missing her.

03:44:01.051 --> 03:44:01.884
MATT: "Very."

03:44:05.051 --> 03:44:05.941
SAM: But at the same time,

03:44:05.941 --> 03:44:08.134
maybe you're a little nervous to go back?

03:44:10.018 --> 03:44:11.818
MATT: "How could I not be?"

03:44:14.461 --> 03:44:15.294
SAM: Yeah.

03:44:18.874 --> 03:44:19.707
I don't--

03:44:20.871 --> 03:44:23.584
I've felt the same way, many times.

03:44:24.581 --> 03:44:27.694
Not sure where I fit in, in the world, really.

03:44:29.161 --> 03:44:33.951
Whether I'm meant to be out exploring and traveling or meant

03:44:33.951 --> 03:44:37.484
to be home caring for someone else or a little of both.

03:44:39.391 --> 03:44:42.791
And for you, it must be impossible.

03:44:42.791 --> 03:44:44.931
You don't even know if you're little one's--

03:44:46.921 --> 03:44:48.611
where she is or

03:44:48.611 --> 03:44:50.874
what she's up to or if she's okay.

03:44:55.134 --> 03:44:57.011
MATT: "You're not wrong."

03:44:57.011 --> 03:44:58.951
SAM: Do you have a sense?

03:44:58.951 --> 03:45:00.734
Have you felt anything?

03:45:04.151 --> 03:45:05.732
MATT: "I believe--

03:45:05.732 --> 03:45:08.813
"I feel in

03:45:09.701 --> 03:45:11.954
"my heart of hearts, in my soul,

03:45:13.301 --> 03:45:16.627
"that my husband and daughter are okay.

03:45:19.391 --> 03:45:22.161
"That dread has never crept in,

03:45:24.151 --> 03:45:25.401
"just nerves.

03:45:30.821 --> 03:45:35.162
"Maybe to wait is just delaying the inevitable."

03:45:37.951 --> 03:45:40.404
SAM: Yeah. I've been thinking the same thing, too,

03:45:41.901 --> 03:45:43.604
but you can't delay forever.

03:45:44.691 --> 03:45:49.669
At some point, you have to-- you have to go home.

03:45:51.861 --> 03:45:53.119
MATT: "You're right.

03:45:55.341 --> 03:45:56.864
"Where're the rest of your friends?"

03:45:58.761 --> 03:46:02.511
SAM: I think one of them's dance fighting and

03:46:04.301 --> 03:46:07.847
one's talking to her fake god and

03:46:07.847 --> 03:46:12.297
I think one's playing her crazy weird harp and

03:46:14.511 --> 03:46:17.947
one's probably just sort of being sad.

03:46:20.905 --> 03:46:24.136
You know, normal, normal, nighttime stuff.

03:46:26.381 --> 03:46:27.521
MATT: "Well, do you think they'd be angry

03:46:27.521 --> 03:46:29.596
"if I left without saying goodbye?"

03:46:32.721 --> 03:46:34.304
SAM: No.

03:46:34.304 --> 03:46:35.596
I mean, not angry.

03:46:35.596 --> 03:46:39.555
They'd be sad that they couldn't say goodbye to you, but

03:46:41.261 --> 03:46:42.954
every one of us has said--

03:46:43.791 --> 03:46:46.381
every one of us has left without saying goodbye

03:46:46.381 --> 03:46:48.426
to someone in our lives.

03:46:51.021 --> 03:46:52.863
We're sort of used to it.

03:46:57.571 --> 03:46:59.046
And it's...

03:47:00.151 --> 03:47:03.607
it's like we thrive on unfinished business.

03:47:06.811 --> 03:47:07.724
So I think...

03:47:09.051 --> 03:47:11.024
I think they would understand.

03:47:13.561 --> 03:47:15.294
MATT: She sets her cup aside

03:47:17.231 --> 03:47:20.451
and traces her fingers in the air for a second.

03:47:20.451 --> 03:47:22.118
As she does, you watch--

03:47:22.118 --> 03:47:25.509
at the top of the vines that formed the leg,

03:47:25.509 --> 03:47:28.111
you watch as these two flowers

03:47:28.111 --> 03:47:33.111
bloom and a third different colors, one pink,

03:47:33.671 --> 03:47:34.504
one white,

03:47:35.791 --> 03:47:36.624
one blue.

03:47:38.381 --> 03:47:40.341
She plucks them from her leg,

03:47:42.401 --> 03:47:44.359
takes the pink one and says,

03:47:47.371 --> 03:47:51.611
"Give this to your tall lanky friend, Caduceus.

03:47:53.461 --> 03:47:57.471
"Tell him that, whether it be just nature itself

03:47:57.471 --> 03:47:59.271
"or the Wild Mother's guidance,

03:48:00.731 --> 03:48:05.696
"he protects the green that keeps those like me alive.

03:48:07.515 --> 03:48:10.056
Hands the blue one to you and says,

03:48:10.056 --> 03:48:14.486
"And give this to the newbie, Fjord,

03:48:14.486 --> 03:48:16.494
"who is beginning his journey,

03:48:17.431 --> 03:48:21.226
"to remind him that the nature that

03:48:21.226 --> 03:48:24.607
"I myself represent is always there to protect him."

03:48:26.284 --> 03:48:27.974
And she takes the white flower and goes,

03:48:29.111 --> 03:48:31.319
"And give this to the quiet one.

03:48:31.319 --> 03:48:32.569
"Yasha.

03:48:33.763 --> 03:48:36.164
"Because I noticed she likes to keep these in a book.

03:48:39.164 --> 03:48:41.090
"And tell everyone else, thank you."

03:48:44.031 --> 03:48:45.372
SAM: I will.

03:48:49.041 --> 03:48:50.614
Yeah, I will.

03:48:52.311 --> 03:48:54.849
I know you'll be happy where you're going.

03:48:56.811 --> 03:48:59.701
And I must say I'm

03:49:00.761 --> 03:49:02.201
jealous of you.

03:49:03.771 --> 03:49:04.912
MATT: "Why?"

03:49:09.331 --> 03:49:12.123
SAM: You're going to kiss that kid.

03:49:19.871 --> 03:49:21.554
MATT: "You're almost done here.

03:49:22.841 --> 03:49:24.081
"I'm sure it won't be long until you get

03:49:24.081 --> 03:49:25.848
"the chance to kiss yours, too."

03:49:30.421 --> 03:49:33.069
SAM: Well, when I do, I'll think of you.

03:49:36.821 --> 03:49:39.262
MATT: She stands up, takes the staff,

03:49:40.431 --> 03:49:43.651
walks over to the nearest tree

03:49:44.591 --> 03:49:49.490
and looks back at you and says, "And thank you, Veth."

03:49:51.441 --> 03:49:55.841
SAM: Thank you for helping us find-- finding the way.

03:49:58.121 --> 03:50:00.431
Do you want 350 gold,

03:50:00.431 --> 03:50:02.891
because we sort of put it aside for you?

03:50:02.891 --> 03:50:05.031
Is that--
LAURA: We put a lot more aside--

03:50:05.031 --> 03:50:07.329
SAM: Is that anything for you or...?

03:50:11.021 --> 03:50:12.212
I mean.

03:50:16.551 --> 03:50:17.980
MATT: "You know what,

03:50:21.951 --> 03:50:24.801
"if you can go ahead and give that to Anola for me."

03:50:24.801 --> 03:50:26.067
SAM: Oh!

03:50:27.171 --> 03:50:28.911
MATT: "She's done about as much to guard

03:50:28.911 --> 03:50:30.171
"and keep this place safe as I have.

03:50:30.171 --> 03:50:33.424
"And I think she'll have more use of it than myself."

03:50:36.291 --> 03:50:37.634
SAM: We will, promise.

03:50:38.641 --> 03:50:39.474
MATT: "Okay."

03:50:39.474 --> 03:50:42.271
SAM: Watch out for oceans and volcanoes.

03:50:42.271 --> 03:50:44.011
Travel safe.

03:50:44.011 --> 03:50:45.061
MATT: "Will do."

03:50:45.951 --> 03:50:47.776
She turns towards the tree,

03:50:49.951 --> 03:50:52.091
takes a deep, visible breath,

03:50:53.041 --> 03:50:55.321
marks the front of it with the staff and you watch as the

03:50:55.321 --> 03:50:57.646
doorway opens up

03:50:58.575 --> 03:51:01.071
and there beyond it, it's a sunset.

03:51:01.071 --> 03:51:03.941
Wherever it is, you can see oranges and purples.

03:51:03.941 --> 03:51:08.279
And the dark blue is taking a sky with bits of white cloud

03:51:08.279 --> 03:51:11.561
that have been swallowed by the same hues in the air.

03:51:11.561 --> 03:51:16.381
You see reddish-brown rock, like a mountain side,

03:51:16.381 --> 03:51:20.562
a precipice of some rocky range.

03:51:21.831 --> 03:51:25.011
You see over the top of the branches,

03:51:25.011 --> 03:51:29.851
what looks like cherry blossom-like leaves

03:51:29.851 --> 03:51:32.991
just framing the exterior of the doorway

03:51:32.991 --> 03:51:34.951
as there are these long benches,

03:51:34.951 --> 03:51:36.541
like an amphitheater sort of set up

03:51:36.541 --> 03:51:37.944
that is arranged around it.

03:51:38.961 --> 03:51:42.104
A few figures sit, stand up curiously.

03:51:43.191 --> 03:51:46.821
As you see a female figure about 20 feet away,

03:51:46.821 --> 03:51:51.064
this heavy mantle of transitioning colors,

03:51:52.051 --> 03:51:57.042
long red hair and these branching pointed antlers,

03:51:58.171 --> 03:51:59.571
just

03:51:59.571 --> 03:52:00.404
turn.

03:52:01.841 --> 03:52:06.541
As Vilya steps through and into the space,

03:52:06.541 --> 03:52:08.086
the people back up

03:52:09.391 --> 03:52:13.424
and the female figure clasps her chest

03:52:14.961 --> 03:52:18.802
and begins to run for her and the doors close.

03:52:21.011 --> 03:52:22.319
SAM: Goodbye.

03:52:24.491 --> 03:52:26.044
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

03:52:26.044 --> 03:52:28.035
(group exclaims)
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:52:33.923 --> 03:52:37.358
MATT: If I'd have known that was
going to happen. That was, ooh!

03:52:37.358 --> 03:52:39.625
TRAVIS: Good stuff, Matty.

03:52:39.625 --> 03:52:40.571
LIAM: What a lovely little scene.

03:52:40.571 --> 03:52:41.604
ASHLEY: (teary-eyed laugh)

03:52:41.604 --> 03:52:43.804
TRAVIS: Good stuff, Matt.
LIAM: Lovely little scene.

03:52:43.804 --> 03:52:46.094
MARISHA: Got me more than I anticipated.

03:52:46.094 --> 03:52:47.210
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:52:48.681 --> 03:52:50.424
MATT: I love you guys.

03:52:50.424 --> 03:52:51.499
ASHLEY: That was beautiful.

03:52:52.917 --> 03:52:54.140
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:52:54.140 --> 03:52:55.033
ASHLEY: So lovely.

03:52:55.033 --> 03:52:59.336
MATT: So we're going to pick up
next week for the actual event.

03:52:59.336 --> 03:53:01.462
We're finally--

03:53:01.462 --> 03:53:03.671
LAURA: We just keep pushing it and pushing it.

03:53:03.671 --> 03:53:05.665
MATT: We're trudging on to Traveler Con.
TRAVIS: We're keeping that money, right?

03:53:05.665 --> 03:53:07.373
We're not giving that to the--

03:53:07.373 --> 03:53:08.881
SAM: What money?
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:53:08.881 --> 03:53:11.450
(laughter)

03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:12.583
ASHLEY: Oh man.

03:53:13.443 --> 03:53:14.727
TALIESIN: We're the literal worst.

03:53:14.727 --> 03:53:16.293
LIAM: Let chaos reign.

03:53:16.293 --> 03:53:18.667
LAURA: Let chaos reign.

03:53:21.121 --> 03:53:23.387
SAM: Episode title: Dinosaurs and Dicks.

03:53:24.411 --> 03:53:26.331
MATT: I think I do have a title in mind:

03:53:26.331 --> 03:53:28.277
A Tale of Too Many Dicks.

03:53:28.277 --> 03:53:29.428
MARISHA: Too many dicks.

03:53:29.428 --> 03:53:31.924
MATT: Yep. All righty, well,

03:53:31.924 --> 03:53:34.873
we'll pick up there next week.

03:53:34.873 --> 03:53:36.501
Until then, everyone,

03:53:36.501 --> 03:53:39.064
know that we love you very much, and

03:53:39.064 --> 03:53:40.491
is it Thursday yet?

03:53:40.491 --> 03:53:41.324
Good night.

03:53:41.324 --> 03:53:42.537
TRAVIS and MARISHA: So good!

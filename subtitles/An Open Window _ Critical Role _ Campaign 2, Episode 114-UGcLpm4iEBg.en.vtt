MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.210
to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.240
Where us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.027
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.027 --> 00:00:09.667
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.642
MATT: If you haven't noticed,
we are in our Halloween episode.

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:15.040
So yes, before we jump into our announcements,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.190
let's go ahead and introduce everyone's

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.150
fantastic Halloween attire.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.130
Let's begin, to my left over here,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.010
we have Travis Willingham.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.496
Dressed as...
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:28.329
Hi, Matt!

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.633
MATT: Hey buddy. (laughs)

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.633
TRAVIS: (Cajun accent) Yeah, I'm Orly.

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:39.875
Navigator of the Balleater.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:42.293
Rest in peace. Oh wait, it's over here.

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:44.360
(laughter)

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.190
I got a wicked sleeve and a Cajun tattoo.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.050
No, accent. (laughs)

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.883
LAURA: Wow.

00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:52.716
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:55.774
TRAVIS: It's really hot in this mask, guys!

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:57.747
It's covered in spray paint.

00:00:57.747 --> 00:00:59.060
MATT: Really fresh spray paint.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.030
TALIESIN: What have you got down there?

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.570
What is that red thing?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.442
That red--
TRAVIS: Oh, this?

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:07.227
Oh, well, he plays the bagpipes.

00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:15.365
(bagpipes squealing)
(laughter)

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.240
MATT: Holy shit! (laughs)

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.811
LIAM: You don't want to see that leaning over your bed

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:23.140
in the middle of the night.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.535
MATT: We should not have started with you.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:26.935
It's all downhill from here.

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:29.270
SAM: Cowabunga!

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.905
MATT: Travis, well done on Orly.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:32.838
LAURA: Wow.
ASHLEY: Oh, fantastic.

00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:34.400
MATT: Now, Laura.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.250
Looking fabulous as...

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.306
LAURA: I'm my dad.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.360
(laughter)

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.593
I'm The Gentleman.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.140
That's all I got, I'm blue.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.322
I got a wineglass.

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:48.739
(laughter)

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.982
I...

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.170
I don't know, that's all I got.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.332
I would've sprayed water on myself,

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:56.040
but the paint would've come off, so...

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.873
This is all I got.

00:01:56.873 --> 00:01:57.706
MATT: Good call. Good call.

00:01:57.706 --> 00:01:59.070
SAM: You look super hot.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.743
MATT: Awesome. You look great, Laura.

00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:03.360
TRAVIS: The contouring, the contouring!

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.410
MARISHA: So good.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.060
MATT: Liam, Liam O'Brien.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.670
LIAM: I am dressed as Astrid, Astrid Beck.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.330
Star pupil of the Soltryce Academy.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.440
I received a lot of great makeup tips

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.630
from Marisha and Laura over the past couple of days.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.103
Thank you, ladies.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:19.010
MARISHA: Looks fabulous.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.470
LIAM: I feel beautiful,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.117
minus the terrible burns.

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:24.170
TRAVIS: Let's see those forearms.
MARISHA: Show off those tattoos.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.140
LAURA: Yeah!

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.973
Ooh!

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.603
SAM: Nice.

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:30.110
LIAM: This is made of toilet paper.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.220
LAURA: Is it really?
MATT: Delightful.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.150
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: That's impressive.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.983
LIAM: And latex.

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:35.903
MATT: Yeah, a little liquid latex. It's classic.

00:02:35.903 --> 00:02:37.960
You look great, man.
LIAM: Thank you.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.380
MATT: Sam.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.070
SAM: I am Kiri!

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.417
Yes, I am very sweet!

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:44.760
(laughter)

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.545
I cannot see!

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.780
MATT: Where's your knife?

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.010
SAM: Oh! (laughs)

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.263
Sorry.

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:53.267
Ah!

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:54.542
(laughter)

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:55.834
I've killed people!

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.997
Welcome to the Mighty Nein!

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.146
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:04.970
Oh my god.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.060
MATT: Perfect, thank you, Sam.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.122
SAM: Go fuck yourself!

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:10.209
(laughter)

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.400
MATT: There you have it.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.383
All righty, Ashley.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.077
ASHLEY: I'm Henry Crabgrass.

00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:17.560
(laughter)

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.577
Always ask for consent!

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:26.090
MATT: I love it, it's so good.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.430
(as Henry) Well, I appreciate that, it's a great choice

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.180
for a Halloween costume, well done.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.070
Taliesin.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.013
TALIESIN: I am Archivist Zeenoth from Zadash.

00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:38.945
Got my book and my scowl.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.420
Quite a bit, quite a bit, yes.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.751
LAURA: And your lovely coif.

00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:43.650
ASHLEY: Oh, lovely.
TALIESIN: Yes, gorgeous.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.260
MARISHA: Good to see you, dude.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.093
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.533
MATT: I guess, while we're in that space,

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:51.320
Marisha, if you'd like to...

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.080
MARISHA: Oh, yes, I am Celia, Celia Ovesso.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.190
Devout follower of The Traveler, and...

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.080
SAM: Amazing.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.740
MARISHA: While I know that I was very cold,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.340
and maybe closed off,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.210
I really don't know if...

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.132
any of this was warranted.
(laughter)

00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:12.965
SAM: So good.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.270
MARISHA: I just don't know if this was

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.452
a just sentence for...

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:22.445
my crimes of just being a little bit too myself, but,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.240
I will have to deal with this for the rest of my life,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.073
so, thank you.

00:04:27.073 --> 00:04:29.820
MATT: Well done.
SAM: What does your shirt say?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.120
Oh, nice, nice.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.700
MARISHA: I got it, some guy was
selling them on the roadside,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.192
on the way out, but I think it's a knockoff.

00:04:38.192 --> 00:04:40.550
TALIESIN: You don't have to be so
hard on yourself there though.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.383
MATT: Hey-o.
ASHLEY: Ey.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.228
LIAM: Just wondering, does anyone have a Wish spell?

00:04:45.228 --> 00:04:47.280
MATT: Just, just if you're looking.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.640
MARISHA: I'm raising money.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.880
You can kick into my GoFundMe

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.643
to try and buy a Wish spell.

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.013
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:04:56.013 --> 00:04:56.846
MATT: All righty.

00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:59.210
Everyone, you look fabulous,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.240
I'm so excited every time the year we get to do this,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.230
it makes me happy.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.789
LAURA: Wait, and who are you, Matt?

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.610
MATT: "I...

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.780
"Am Artagan, in some places known as The Traveler.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.783
"And let me tell you--"

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.880
"Well, actually it's not much of religion anymore, is it?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.900
"Never mind, just go about your business,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.203
"and, sorry, Celia.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.576
"Don't worry."

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:21.409
LAURA: You look really good!

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.683
ASHLEY: You look so good.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.710
MATT: Well, let's go ahead

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.480
and jump into our announcements tonight,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.283
beginning with our sponsor for the evening,

00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:30.330
NordVPN, Sam.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.290
SAM: Happy Hack-oween, web crawlers!

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.160
I've been stroking my keys all year

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.260
trying to defrag the Ultracodex

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.200
and save the WWW Dot Planet.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.860
But tonight, the only packets I'll be DL-ing

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.560
are these delicious assorted candy bars

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.150
I picked up trick or leet-ing this week. (chuckles)

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.110
Oh! Oh no!

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.460
Candy corn?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.010
My candy bag has been hacked!

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.250
If only I had somehow installed NordVPN on it!

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.110
Providers of highest quality encryption

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.110
for your internet traffic and hiding your IP

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.440
and physical location.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.040
Right now, they have a special cyber deal,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.230
every two year plan purchase

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.770
gets one additional month free

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.930
and a surprise gift, go to nordvpn.com/criticalrole

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.178
and use coupon "criticalrole" at checkout to sign up,

00:06:14.178 --> 00:06:17.350
but what kind of cookie monster

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.200
would jailbreak somebody's hard candy hard drive?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.542
I will have to do a sweet scan to find out!

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:27.067
MATT: Oh my god. (laughs)
SAM: (trills)

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:29.020
LIAM: Oh, wow. Sound effects.
SAM: Oh, look!

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.940
What's this? Holy HDMI!

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.060
A hidden USB drive!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.797
I'll just... Jack in.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:39.455
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:06:39.455 --> 00:06:40.330
SAM: Uh-huh.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.510
Okay, here we go.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.830
(laughter)

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.340
Trip the trinary, snork the SilverHawk,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.410
leg sweep the Cobra Kai, gleaming cube, I've hacked it!

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.440
It's a text file that says,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.280
"Eat this, you latex dork."

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.667
What does that even mean?

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:57.980
MATT: Wait, wait, wait.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.550
Latex?

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.003
SAM: Yeah, latex dork.

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.950
MATT: That's my Playa name, when we're at Burning Man,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.830
Marisha calls me latex dork.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.223
SAM: Why does Marisha call you latex dork?

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.320
MATT: No reason...

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.600
MARISHA: (chuckles)

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.310
SAM: But why would they insult you, Matt?

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.440
That's my job!

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.080
Wait a second. Matt?

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.963
Check your desk.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.613
MATT: What?

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.200
The missing candy!

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.490
SAM: Yes, I knew it.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.630
Whoever key punched my Kit-Kats

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.580
is trying to turn us against each other!

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.860
Drive a wedge between you and me, but why?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.913
And who?

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.170
MATT: Maybe we'll find out,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.490
next time NordVPN sponsors this show,

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.850
maybe, if it ever happens again.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.606
SAM: Check them out at nordvpn.com, Matt, hack to you.

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:45.239
TRAVIS: (bagpipes squeaking)

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:47.822
(laughter)

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.710
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.240
Thank you, NordVPN, thank you, Orly,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.070
for the wonderful musical accompaniment there.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.720
LIAM: Funky, little turtle man.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.930
MATT: Indeed.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.213
We have a few other announcements.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.110
Some of you may have noticed, but

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.380
this week, we announced

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.454
our brand new publishing company, Darrington Press.

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.812
(cheering)

00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:12.420
Been in the works for a little while,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.250
happy we can finally talk about it.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.205
It is headed by our good friend, Ivan Van Norman here.

00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:20.329
(cheering)
"Hey, guys!"

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:22.820
Some people know them in the tabletop space.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.250
We've all been doing this stuff

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.590
together for a long time, he's wonderful

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.440
and we're happy to have him helming that.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.640
And I'm excited to be on the board

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.910
as a creative advisor as well.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.640
We have a lot of cool things coming up.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.210
First off, our game coming out first, Uk'otoa,

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.533
which we'll release in the first quarter of 2021.

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.080
Uk'otoa is a tactical game

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.660
of semi-cooperative card play

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.160
with factions of sailors

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.820
vying to be the final survivor

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.664
of the raging sea leviathan, Uk'otoa.

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:52.330
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa...

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.670
MATT: You can sign up for our newsletter

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.910
at darringtonpress.com to hear more about Uk'otoa

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.020
and our other upcoming releases.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.790
Oh, and check out our announcement at critrole.com

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.930
for more information on Darrington Press,

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.030
a peek at Uk'otoa's box art and creative team,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.217
and a glance at our game slate for 2021.

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:12.190
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa...
MATT: Super excited. Wow, you guys.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.993
Just, some things never die.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.693
TALIESIN: Like Uk'otoa.

00:09:15.693 --> 00:09:17.629
MATT: Ashley, you got some announcements, I believe?

00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:19.713
ASHLEY: Hey!

00:09:19.713 --> 00:09:21.305
So...

00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:24.453
Thank you so much for your support.

00:09:24.453 --> 00:09:27.353
(laughter)

00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:29.530
I'm not going to be able to do this seriously.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.670
Yeah, thank you so much

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.837
for everything that you guys have done

00:09:32.837 --> 00:09:36.758
and all of your support for the Critical Role Foundation.

00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:39.380
So since this show is prerecorded,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.733
I don't have gloves, so.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.690
It's hard to give you an accurate update

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.710
as to where we are at with the campaign.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.720
But we'll be closing our First Nations campaign

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.670
once we hit $200,000.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.040
Which will fund the Native Youth and Culture Funds

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.160
for eight programs.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.267
We were just starting with two,

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.750
and then you guys are just amazing.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.130
We're so stoked, this is so awesome.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.750
And then, as a reminder,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.730
whenever we don't have an active campaign,

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.180
donations received will be split evenly

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.380
between our partner charities.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.390
We got 826LA.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.190
We got OSD.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.353
We got Red Nose Day.

00:10:22.353 --> 00:10:24.660
We got the Pablove Foundation.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.770
And we got OutRight Action International.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.480
And with 10% continuing to go to our emergency relief fund,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.300
we have many plans, we are so excited,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.560
thank you so much.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.780
For more info, go to criticalrolefoundation.org.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.800
MATT: Thank you, Ashley, and thank you, everyone

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.937
for being fabulous, generous, and good souls.

00:10:47.937 --> 00:10:49.550
And for your faith.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.799
No seriously, you guys have been fantastic.

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:51.982
Thank you for supporting this endeavor

00:10:51.982 --> 00:10:53.288
and it's just the beginning.

00:10:53.288 --> 00:10:55.880
More good to come. Thank you.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.950
Laura, you had some things to talk about.
LAURA: Feel like Orly was trying to play just then

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.542
and it wasn't coming out.

00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:01.682
TRAVIS: (bagpipes squeaking)

00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:03.355
LAURA: There you go.
MATT: With the Night Court theme?

00:11:03.355 --> 00:11:04.949
(laughter)

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:06.532
MATT: It's good.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.256
LAURA: We got some merch to talk about today!

00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.319
MATT: Okay!

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:14.152
LAURA: It's the holidays.

00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:15.360
The holidays are coming up.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.230
So you know, we've been making some stuff

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.880
because we know, you know, stuff is cool.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.890
Okay.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.150
LIAM: Your voice sounds so strange

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.535
coming out of that dude's mouth.
LAURA: I know, it's weird.

00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:26.630
I wish I could talk with a lower voice, but I can't.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.204
Look at these!

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:30.480
SAM: (yelling) Look it! Look at it!

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480
LAURA: These are-- everybody wants

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.950
comfy cozy clothes right now, me especially.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.740
And these are, we have joggers.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.570
These have Nicodranas on them

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.450
and it's got a really cool little graphic.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.850
MARISHA: So cute!
LAURA: They're so comfy.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.683
Okay.

00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:46.510
Also, as far as comfy clothes go.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.160
SAM: Oh, come on!
LAURA: I'm really excited

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.910
about this.
SAM: Don't even, with me.

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:52.671
LAURA: We have a pair of pajamas.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.110
(cheering and laughter)

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.651
MATT: That's all I'm going to wear.
MARISHA: I'm just going to wear

00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:58.640
that shirt all the time!
LAURA: I know!

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.980
And they're so soft,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.360
and all the doodles were done by Wendy Doodles.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.690
(cheering)

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.668
LIAM: That's how you dress for 2020.
LAURA: That's right.

00:12:05.668 --> 00:12:06.957
SAM: Are those, do they feel--

00:12:06.957 --> 00:12:09.630
remember the pajamas that we wore in that video?

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.613
LAURA: They are way better

00:12:10.613 --> 00:12:12.213
than the pajamas in that video.
SAM: Okay, because those were awful.

00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:14.369
LAURA: Yeah, no, these are actually really soft.

00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:17.280
They're like, jersey, cotton t-shirt material,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.300
it's wonderful. And then the joggers

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.010
are really soft and smushy on the inside,

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.300
I was very adamant that I wanted soft and smushy stuff.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.133
SAM: Awesome.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.690
LAURA: And then, we've got--
TRAVIS: (sneezes)

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.988
(ruefully) Oh...

00:12:27.988 --> 00:12:30.770
LIAM: Ew...
TALIESIN: (cackles)

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.736
LAURA: We have this puzzle!

00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:34.161
(cheering)

00:12:34.161 --> 00:12:36.320
This puzzle is Vox Machina.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.890
It matches our Mighty Nein one,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.223
designed by Lauren Walsh,

00:12:41.223 --> 00:12:43.820
by our friends at The OP, The Op.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.653
Huh?

00:12:44.653 --> 00:12:45.500
MATT: I said, "Yay, Lauren!"

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.461
LAURA: Yay, Lauren.

00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:48.850
(cheering)

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.370
All right, all right, all right.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.950
There's a couple other things.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.600
We released a lot of stuff today!

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.270
We have a whole line of Vox Machina chibi pins

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.000
to match our Mighty Nein chibi pins.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.440
That includes here, Percy and Vex.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.747
TRAVIS: Aw, so cuties.

00:13:06.747 --> 00:13:08.340
LAURA: Aw, and little baby Trinket.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.304
Oh, and little chibi Pike!

00:13:12.304 --> 00:13:14.440
And Scanlan!

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.800
Oh, and, oh here's a little.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.250
I like this, because Keyleth and Vax match each other.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.410
They both have their--

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.331
ALL: Oh!
MATT: Oh, I love that!

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:24.653
LAURA: Their little opening.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.218
And then we have Grog Strongjaw.

00:13:30.127 --> 00:13:31.883
And Taryon Darrington!

00:13:31.883 --> 00:13:32.873
(cheering)

00:13:32.873 --> 00:13:35.550
And all of these pins were done by Jenny Park,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.490
and they're super cute, and our own Aaron

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.400
designed the backing, and I'm obsessed

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.350
with all the backs.

00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:45.020
And then,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.150
we also have.
MATT: Damn, Laura's been busy!

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.170
LAURA: Dude, I know, okay?

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.650
So our Tal'Dorei Republic tank,

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.487
and our Beau...

00:13:53.487 --> 00:13:54.320
SAM: Sleeves are bullshit?

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.674
LAURA: Sleeves are bullshit, are both available in the AU.

00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:00.540
SAM: In the AU?
LAURA: Wait, jeez, wait.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.460
SAM: Atomic Units?
LAURA: No, Australian.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.580
SAM: Are they halfway to the sun?

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.090
LAURA: Wait.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.220
SAM: Astronomical Units?
LAURA: The lighter one...

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.840
I don't know if I have all the things I'm supposed to have.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.740
There's all different variants

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.800
and they're available in the UK and Australia.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.680
You should check them out

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.920
and see what you have in your store!

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.181
I did good job on these announcements.

00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:22.381
MARISHA: You did, you did!

00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:25.924
MATT: Yay!
(applause)

00:14:25.924 --> 00:14:27.000
MARISHA: Nailed it!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.180
MATT: (as Artagan) "If I must say,
I thought that was a wonderful job."

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.850
LAURA: Oh, thank you very much, I appreciate that.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.865
TRAVIS: (bagpipes squeaking)

00:14:34.865 --> 00:14:37.050
SAM: Why do you do this with the bag?

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.860
TRAVIS: I lost the instruction manual!

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.540
ASHLEY: That's the air, right?

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.576
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:14:41.576 --> 00:14:43.530
SAM: I understand pushing it, but he's like,

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.516
he's working it with his fingers like it's a guitar!

00:14:46.516 --> 00:14:47.980
ASHLEY: It's more of a...

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.660
LAURA: Well, it's a teeny tiny bagpipe, so...

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.390
MARISHA: I like it.
TRAVIS: (squeaky bagpipe)

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.660
MATT: It's a very, very, Bill and Ted way of doing it.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.670
I respect that.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.450
All right, well.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.115
I believe that brings us to the end of our announcements.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:01.920
So let's go ahead and jump into

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.284
tonight's episode of...

00:15:04.284 --> 00:15:05.225
Critical Role.

00:15:05.225 --> 00:15:06.925

00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:09.916

00:15:09.916 --> 00:15:12.232

00:16:43.715 --> 00:16:44.840
MATT: Welcome back.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.120
So right before we hop in,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.595
one quick correction, Laura, realized.

00:16:49.595 --> 00:16:50.740
LAUR: All right, I found the things

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.510
I was supposed to show off.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.690
Here's the tank tops I was supposed to talk about.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.609
This one, oh no.

00:16:57.609 --> 00:17:00.438
(laughter)

00:17:00.438 --> 00:17:02.810
This one is available in our UK store,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.540
this one's available in our Australia store.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.240
They're slightly different colors!

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:09.840
TRAVIS: Nice, nice.
(applause)

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.742
LAURA: I love you guys.

00:17:10.742 --> 00:17:11.830
SAM: Worth it.
MARISHA: Nailed it!

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:12.700
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.050
LIAM: Stuck the landing.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.070
MATT: So last we left off, Mighty Nein.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.900
After making a deal with the Archmage of Antiquity

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.080
of the Cerberus Assembly, Lady Vess DeRogna,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.320
to escort her to the northern region

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.580
known as Eiselcross, to head towards

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.340
possibly an excavation

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.970
for the long lost, pre-Calamity city of Aeor.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.420
You made your way northward to the very

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.900
final precipice of the Greying Wildlands,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.950
chartered a ship known as the Midnight Hammer,

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.460
and made your way across the dangerous Frigid Depths.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.050
For days you journeyed with some chance encounters,

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.330
along with an ambush by the apparently raised,

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.850
undead Captain Avantika, seeking one such item

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.040
that you still carry, the last remnant

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.280
required to unleash Uk'otoa.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.530
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa...

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.170
MATT: After she escaped with this artifact,

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.840
you gave chase as orcas, and,

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.670
through some ingenuity and some quick movement,

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.040
managed to head her off at the curb.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.500
And in doing so dispatch her undead form

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.760
deep beneath the waves.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.873
Returning to the ship,

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.070
you made your way to the final elements of this journey.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.430
And we left off as the Midnight Hammer began

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.000
to slowly dock into

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.430
Balenpost, on the southern edge of Foren.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:42.320
The central largest island portion of Eiselcross.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.153
So.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.400
You watch as the ship makes that impact sensation,

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.350
that grinding (booms) as it hits the rock and ice.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.170
Signifying it coming to a stop.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.930
Its last bit of momentum

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.740
only being ceased by the heavy piece of earth

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.480
that meets it there.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.080
Lady Vess comes out and conjures

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.690
this greenish array of sparks in the sky above

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.990
that you see forming into the familiar trio symbol,

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.840
the triad of diamonds, that is the symbol

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.323
of the Cerberus Assembly.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.260
At that point, the once threadbare crew

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.300
that once stood at the docks

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.310
begins to grow more and more crowded

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.770
as individuals begin to come out with materials

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.040
and set up the gangplank and help weigh down anchor

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.930
and tie it to the dock.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.390
Immediately you see heavily bundled dock workers

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.690
begin to fix the vessel in place

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.010
and figures begin to step onboard,

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.500
wrapped in thick padded jackets

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.193
of red leathers and gray fur.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.742
You see a man,

00:19:39.742 --> 00:19:41.170
human in his 50s,

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.510
a tangled curly mop of light brown hair

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.170
receding at the temples approach and say,

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.090
"Ah, hello, my friend.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.030
"I was not expecting you to come quite so...

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.673
"abruptly, but you are of course welcome, Lady."

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.440
And, Lady Vess gives a little nod and goes,

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.320
"I am here with my compatriots.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.450
"They are my hired hands for this endeavor.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.773
"Please make sure they are taken care of."

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.360
He goes and turns to her and says,

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.910
"How long is the ship to remain in port?"

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.610
And she goes, "Well, actually, they,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.670
"they were only hired to drop us off,

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.760
"so they may return about their business

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.470
"once they have gathered their supplies."

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:28.470
He goes, "All right, and your compatriots here?

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.033
"Is there a leader or a
name of which I should refer to you?"

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.440
TRAVIS: Yes, of course, we are known as the Mighty Nein.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.060
MATT: "Mighty Nein. I take it you are the leader."

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.303
TRAVIS: Oh no.
LAURA: He's our captain.

00:20:42.303 --> 00:20:43.790
SAM: Caleb's more the leader.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.510
LAURA: Well...
SAM: But, I mean,

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.260
at sea, he's the leader, sure, sure.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.440
MATT: "Mm.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.520
"I am Wardlow Akron.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.570
"It is my charge to keep Balenpost in check

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.000
"and well-greased in these cold, icy regions.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.960
"So should you require anything,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.620
"don't ask me, but certainly know

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.803
"that you're under my,

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.580
"under my guise while you're around.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.940
"And how long were you planning to stay?"

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.734
As he leans in and Lady Vess, who's,

00:21:12.734 --> 00:21:14.460
at this point, starting to walk off the ship,

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.673
giving him half attention, goes,

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.490
"I gather probably no more than a day or two

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.310
"as we gather supplies and head northward,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.823
"but we should not be in your way."

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.070
At which point they step off,

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.510
if you guys want to follow suit

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.620
there's a now a crowd of people following,

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.030
flanking side to side,

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.050
escorting you as you make your way off the dock

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.870
to the central gate that meets the docks

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.030
and head inward to the actual fort of Balenpost itself.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.460
The heavy, tall, 10-ish foot

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.500
log walls greeting you there with a little bit

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.930
of a shimmer of ice that has gathered on the outside

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.450
that you can see glistens a bit

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.300
with what bit of light is coming through the grayish sky.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.770
You watch as Wardlow leans forward again and goes,

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.030
"Whenever you're comfortable, I would,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.530
"I'm sure there are some who would be eager

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.030
"to give you a tour of the current projects

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.520
"in Horswell's laboratory."

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.030
And she goes, "That would be sufficient.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.240
"But, however, allow us to gather our things,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.210
"find some bit of comfort, perhaps a meal,

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.760
"and then I'll come to find you.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.540
"Come, come," and looks to all of you

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.780
with a bit of a flick of a finger to follow suit.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.790
The gates that are partially opened

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.940
lead into the central fort of Balenpost,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.200
and around you can see

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.380
the flickering orange glow of torchlight

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.560
amongst various elements of the walls.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.470
You're dealing with the fact of me

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.020
giving this presentation as Artagan?

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.747
LAURA: And just looking around.
MARISHA: Just, all of us.

00:22:42.747 --> 00:22:45.390
LAURA: Yeah, I know, every time I look at Ashley, really.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.023
MATT: This is why I love the Halloween episode so much.

00:22:49.389 --> 00:22:50.750
I'm only hoping we can get, you know,

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.510
more important character advancement,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.830
and dramatic scenes.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.190
Like when Veth got her body back

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.138
when Sam was dressed as a leprechaun,

00:22:59.138 --> 00:23:00.120
let's make this happen.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.260
MATT: So far, what I've learned in this episode is,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.650
eyebrows, eyebrows, eyebrows...

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.721
MATT: Moley moley mole.

00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:09.480
(laughter)

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.860
So.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.180
Entering the inside,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.460
your feet crunch over the heavy, thick,

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.800
now grimy and gray patched snow and ice

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.630
that seems to be gathered and pressed to the edges

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.250
of the inside of the courtyard that is the fort itself.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.700
You can see numerous tents and small structures

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.660
that line the perimeter of it

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.760
with small wooden watchtowers that poke over the edges

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.760
where you can see guards

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.020
with longbows and crossbows

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.290
just keeping watch from higher positions.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:43.720
You can see there is one, large, central fortification

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.990
that sits on the western edge

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.070
of the inside of this courtyard

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.860
which was the large structure you saw

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.710
as you came into dock.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.530
This looks to be the central barracks

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.640
and main defensive positioning point within Balenpost.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.540
A multi-floored, stone and wood building.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.470
Almost like a small, castle-like fortification,

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.530
but of less accessible materials.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:07.950
It looks to be a bit more ramshackle,

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.250
but definitely functional.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.580
As you're guided up through the courtyard,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.910
you can see the heavy portcullis

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.873
of cross met iron bars begins to lift up,

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.610
out of your way.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.310
As you head into the interior of the base floor

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.210
of this main fort structure,

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.600
immediately the temperature becomes a bit warmer

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.280
and more welcoming.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.420
The light is limited, beyond a couple of sconces

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.900
of metal that are bolted into elements

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.220
of the stone and wood.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.470
And even then the embers burn low.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.080
But it is a much better interior

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.530
than the top of the ship

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.963
or your walk brusquely to this position.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.040
Heading inside, you begin to take stock of the interior.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.781
You hear Akron apologizing briefly to Lady Vess.

00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:54.985
You hear Akron apologizing briefly to Lady Vess.

00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:56.740
"I'm terribly sorry

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.630
"about the current circumstances

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.150
"and our limited supplies.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.900
"The situation in Icehaven,

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.880
"north of Icehaven, has somewhat caused issues

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.430
"with the supply ships, as you know.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.333
"Hopefully they won't be diverted much longer, but for now,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.357
"we're doing what we can with what we have."

00:25:16.357 --> 00:25:18.503
And she gives a nod, continues walking.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.440
Into the base part of this fort proper,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.270
the central main chamber,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.340
there are rickety tables and stools

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.253
strewn about this darkly lit area

00:25:30.253 --> 00:25:31.577
just the elements of lantern light

00:25:31.577 --> 00:25:34.320
occasionally scatter across a handful of these tables.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.500
You can see miserable-looking workers

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.300
and other members of Balenpost itself

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.250
sitting and drinking from rather rugged cups,

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.080
eating very plain-looking food

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.670
lacking any color in this low light

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:48.680
let alone, if that would help,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.438
if it was a brighter space.

00:25:51.438 --> 00:25:53.060
Very little conversation, and mostly

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.570
just a lot of grumbles, chewing,

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.890
and staring at the newcomers

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.426
as you all step into the central region here.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.210
After a brief moment, you see Vess goes,

00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:06.960
"Ah, well,"

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.670
gestures to the rest of you.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.650
"This is fortuitous,

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.117
"perhaps we'll have a longer conversation.

00:26:13.117 --> 00:26:14.279
"Dagen!

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:15.112
"Dagen."

00:26:15.112 --> 00:26:17.990
And she gives a hand call over.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.230
You watch as this

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.920
extremely grizzled-looking male dwarf approaches

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.690
from the corner of the shadows.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:30.542
His face, a mess of tanned leathery skin,

00:26:30.542 --> 00:26:33.440
callouses frame edges of his chin

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.240
and a mane of jet black hair

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.910
that tumbles thick past his shoulders.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.193
And seems to mesh with this very,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.100
rat's nest of a black beard

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.320
that rests over the clavicle.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.800
His tattoos wrap his arms right up to the bracer.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.170
And,

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.650
more, you assume, are probably hidden

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.420
beneath his breastplate.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.810
His arms flex impressively

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.870
as he pushes himself near you,

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.030
within an intricate chair of scuffed metal and wood.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.310
A large pair of slanted wheels affixed to its sides.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.120
With numerous tools and plates bolted onto it.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.980
You've seen contraptions like this before around Exandria,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.780
but none quite as dangerous looking as this.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.660
He brings himself forward

00:27:13.796 --> 00:27:15.903
and glances to all the rest of you.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.160
"Lady Vess.

00:27:19.229 --> 00:27:22.313
"I can see you've made your way here and,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.600
"I take it these are your compatriots

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.020
"that are going to be coming along the journey,

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.670
"is that correct?"

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.470
TRAVIS: Indeed. We are the Mighty Nein.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.020
We are at your disposal.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.630
MATT: "Mm.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:35.463
"Dagen.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.723
"Well, make yourselves at home.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.080
"We'll go ahead and talk on preparation soon enough.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.140
"Y'all look a bit haggard

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.560
"and worse for wear from the journey,

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.223
"I know it's been some time, but,

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:52.950
"if you need anything, come find me."

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.790
SAM: You're our guide, correct?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:55.810
MATT: "Indeed."

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.740
SAM: Do you know, just so we can prepare,

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.350
will we be journeying on foot, or

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.120
on the back of some sort of beast,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.630
or in a wheeled vehicle of some sort?

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.030
MATT: "Not a whole lot of beasts that can be tamed

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.320
"for bringing up on these parts.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.998
"So we're going to have to take this by foot."

00:28:14.998 --> 00:28:16.230
SAM: Huh.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.063
Okay.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.580
LIAM: Also, I hope you don't mind my asking,

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.670
but this place seems very well-guarded.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.810
What are the primary threats

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.021
in this region that you are on guard against?

00:28:27.021 --> 00:28:29.250
MATT: "(laughs)

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.920
"Let's get a few drinks later on, we'll talk about it."

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.000
LAURA: How long until we leave?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.833
MATT: "Well, I guess that's up to,"

00:28:34.833 --> 00:28:36.593
and he points to Vess and Vess goes,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.560
"No more than 40 or so hours.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.600
"Just some time to situate, relax.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.820
"I have a few meetings to take

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.980
"and then we will make our way, northward, huh?"

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.280
TRAVIS: Is Akron still around?

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.417
MATT: Akron is about maybe 10 feet behind her.

00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:56.240
TRAVIS: And he was who met us at the docks, right?

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.840
MATT: Correct.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.890
TRAVIS: Can I go over to him and say:

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:03.020
I'm assuming this is a very busy port.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.910
Have you seen, by chance,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.520
an old acquaintance of ours?

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.115
A purple tiefling with red eyes come through here recently?

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.583
MATT: "Can't say that I have.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.117
"This place isn't as busy as you'd think."

00:29:18.117 --> 00:29:18.950
TRAVIS: Hmm.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.690
MATT: "But...

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.700
"We'll keep an eye out."

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.230
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.780
MATT: "Is there any concern with this individual?"

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.600
TRAVIS: Oh, not at all. No, no, no.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.190
He's a fellow explorer, like ourselves.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.000
He might've found his way up here.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.163
But, you know, his research is his own.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.833
MATT: "Fair enough.

00:29:36.833 --> 00:29:38.480
"Well, this does tend to draw

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.160
"some of those with some...

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.830
"delving experience and a need for coin, so,

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:48.080
"if he hasn't been here soon,
he might show up at some point.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.250
"And if that happens, I'll let Lady Vess know.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.150
"And she'll convey this to you, I assume, right?"

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.170
And she goes, "Of course.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.780
"Not a worry."

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.613
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.260
MATT: You said what?

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.220
SAM: No, nothing.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.760
I'm not there, so I'm not making any insight check.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.658
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

00:30:06.658 --> 00:30:07.550
TRAVIS: (pigeon coo)

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.160
MATT: After this moment,

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.630
you can see Vess is having a quiet conversation

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.633
with Dagen and then turns over,

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.640
back to you--
MARISHA: Can I see them?

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.700
MATT: You can see them.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.280
MARISHA: What are they saying?

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.588
(whispering) I can read lips.

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:24.810
LAURA: (whispering) Are you Observant?

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.223
MARISHA: (whispering) Yes, I am!
LAURA: (whispering) Nice!

00:30:26.223 --> 00:30:27.610
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.310
Because you are in low light here.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.250
MARISHA: Perception check?

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.900
Okay.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.270
MATT: Just because they're a little bit of a ways away

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.820
and there's low light, so.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.653
MARISHA: 18.

00:30:39.653 --> 00:30:40.713
MATT: 18, yeah. Easy enough.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.310
You see her leaning in, and

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.223
what you catch is her saying,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.640
"Do not worry, gather what we need.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.126
"We'll be out of here soon.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.370
"The payment will be delivered

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:58.593
"upon our disembarking."

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.085
MARISHA: This was to Dagen?

00:31:01.085 --> 00:31:02.027
MATT: This was to Dagen, yeah.

00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:03.459
MARISHA: Okay.

00:31:03.459 --> 00:31:06.150
SAM: All right, business.
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.200
Okay.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.890
LIAM: I am still totally disoriented

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.040
and can't tell who's talking.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:11.873
At any time.

00:31:11.873 --> 00:31:13.010
All the wrong voices.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.563
LAURA: I know, it's really...

00:31:15.563 --> 00:31:16.974
TRAVIS:a I keep losing Ashley.

00:31:16.974 --> 00:31:19.730
I'm like, huh? (laughs)

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.559
MARISHA: You do blend in with the light quite well.
ASHLEY: This is hot!

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:24.380
I'm like--

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.934
MATT: Yeah.

00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:29.420
Lady Vess turns back to Wardlow Akron, says,

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.713
"I assume my quarters have been prepared?"

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.000
To which he says, "Yes, Lady DeRogna."

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.180
"Good."

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.793
She turns to the rest of you.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.910
"Take the day to prepare for the lengthy journey ahead.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.660
"Gather whatever you need

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.360
"from whatever meager supplies they may have available.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.160
"Ask around.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.260
"Get familiar with the terrain.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.707
"I have some business to handle with Akron.

00:31:53.707 --> 00:31:55.360
"We'll take a night's rest,

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.190
"then after that long journey,

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.510
"we'll begin a new one with Mr. Dagen Underthorn here.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.383
"Tomorrow midday, perhaps, weather willing.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.050
"See you perhaps for dinner."

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:08.883
SAM: All right.

00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:10.920
MATT: She begins to make her way up the stairs.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.580
SAM: Well?

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.130
It's just us, then.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.670
I guess we'll do our standard day of training

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:18.870
that we always do together?

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.090
LAURA: Yes, definitely, all of the training.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:21.923
SAM: Yeah.

00:32:21.923 --> 00:32:25.290
So that we're an elite super force tomorrow.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:26.720
TALIESIN: Or we could buy more food.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.553
SAM: Okay.

00:32:27.553 --> 00:32:29.630
LAURA: Oh yeah, because we gave all of ours to the cetus.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.970
TALIESIN: Yeah, that might be an option.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:32.970
SAM: Let's do that instead.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.000
TALIESIN: All right.
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.460
LAURA: I bet the food will be very expensive here.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.760
TALIESIN: It's only money.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.343
LAURA: That's true.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.470
SAM: Well, I'll just ask around

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.956
and see if there's a--

00:32:44.956 --> 00:32:46.660
if anyone can recommend--

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.370
We're in a bar right now? Where are we?

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:50.900
MATT: It's more like--
SAM: A fort?

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.100
MATT: You're in the bottom floor of this multi,

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.163
probably three story tall,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.580
boxy fortress that is built from stone and wood

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.800
that sits as the central and largest

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.080
bulwark here in Balenpost.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.040
SAM: And then around that is,

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.977
like, other structures and a wall or is it open?

00:33:09.977 --> 00:33:11.610
MATT: Yeah, there's a large,

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.320
slightly oval or kidney shaped wall

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.450
that surrounds the entirety of Balenpost

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.340
and around the inside of the wall,

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.040
there are tents and heavier structures,

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.180
but none of them even remotely close to the size

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.890
of this central fortress.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.670
SAM: All right, I'll just ask around
and see if there's any place that--

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.670
or person, or tent that sells food.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.011
MATT: Okay. Okay.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.498
Go ahead and make an investigation check for me.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.190
SAM: 32.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:43.340
MATT: 32.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.660
Looking about, just quickly glancing

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.350
at the way the system of society

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.860
seems to function here.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.270
You quickly begin to make out

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.010
that there are some tents and structures

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.590
that are heavily storage-based,

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.140
some that you know, gather...

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.470
generally supplies to maintain

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.530
the survival of everyone here.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.393
And, that area is very heavily guarded.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.210
You do notice, on the northeastern side

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.380
near the gate, you do see a green tent

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.690
where Dagen Underthorn is making his way towards.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:21.190
Possibly either his abode or he has business there.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.700
You do see...

00:34:25.534 --> 00:34:27.800
there's not much of a society here.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.890
Most of it is designed for the military-ish

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.610
or guarding purposes of this location

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:37.090
and the folks who stay here vary between

00:34:39.335 --> 00:34:43.190
Dwendalian Empire attire,

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.950
some semblance of townsguard, but not quite as uniform,

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.690
and many just appear to be rough and tumble sell-swords

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.730
that make their living

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.843
with whatever business Balenpost wishes to hire them for.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.580
But there are probably, after asking around a bit,

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.312
you find there are some individuals here

00:35:01.312 --> 00:35:04.440
that are willing to sell you supplies that are their own.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.710
There isn't so much a large business here

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.300
for selling a lot of people that come in and out.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.930
Most everyone here has some sort of business

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.033
with the Empire and materials are given.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.503
But you can attempt to...

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.260
to discuss what business you have here

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.630
and perhaps push that weight a bit.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:24.179
SAM: Sure, if there's someone to talk to?

00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:25.012
MATT: Okay.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:30.100
You do watch as one of the buildings has

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.120
a number of thick leathers

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.870
that are somewhat frozen

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.920
and placed over the back wall of one structure.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.690
And you can see there,

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.390
rope is tied around large wooden slats

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.270
in a way where you gather,

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.240
a lot of captured or hunted game

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.800
is probably prepared for meals

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.060
and whatever resources are on them

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.620
can be taken and utilized about.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.400
And you do notice,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.360
on the inside of the partially ajar door,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.470
you see this hulking humanoid form

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.160
that's in the process of

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.730
currently carving a heavy piece of skin

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.200
from some sort of a corpse.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.760
SAM: Caduceus, you want to come talk to this fellow

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.640
about meat with me?

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.960
TALIESIN: I mean,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.620
meat's not really going to do me any good, but sure.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.800
SAM: Oh, but I mean for the others.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.610
TALIESIN: All right, I just don't know much about it,

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.640
but let me-- let me see what I can--

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.317
ASHLEY: I know a good amount about meat.

00:36:23.317 --> 00:36:25.190
SAM: You want to come? Meat talk?

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.560
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can do some meat talk!

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.980
TALIESIN: I think between the three of us, we could do this.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.240
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: We'll do-- we'll have a meat-cute.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.170
TRAVIS: I can't fucking do it! (laughs)

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.120
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: It's so... (laughs)

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.953
SAM: Hello!

00:36:37.326 --> 00:36:40.170
MATT: (squeaks) As you press into the door,

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.730
it grinds and squeaks at the same time,

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.610
its hinges themselves partially frozen

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.950
from lack of mobility and movement.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.770
As you press in and say, "Hello,"

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.340
what little bit of light there is flickering

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.990
from the nearby lantern that's framing this hulking figure,

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.910
the hulking figure spins around quickly,

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.270
still holding this large, hooked looking

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:00.713
Bowie knife-like blade,

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.070
and clutching whatever half-carved corpse

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.890
is laid across this wooden table in the other hand

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:07.990
and turns to you.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.700
You now see this tall,

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.450
human, but larger.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.215
You can take a moment to focus in

00:37:14.215 --> 00:37:16.430
and appears to be of giant blood.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.560
Female goliath.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.530
Hair completely shorn,

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.313
and a series of tattoos that appear to be scars.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.802
Self-imposed, or at least intentionally placed designs

00:37:27.802 --> 00:37:29.300
that are scarred into the flesh,

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.503
across the face, down the chest.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.770
Just wearing this loose leather apron

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.470
that's lying in the front of them.

00:37:39.209 --> 00:37:41.220
"What do you want?"

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.002
SAM: Oh, hi there.

00:37:43.002 --> 00:37:43.919
TALIESIN: Oh.
SAM: I...

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.467
ASHLEY: We came to talk to you about some meat

00:37:47.467 --> 00:37:49.280
and some provisions, you know?

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.270
Things of that nature,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.264
just wanted to see what type of meat you have.

00:37:54.264 --> 00:37:55.814
MATT: "We got meat."

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.478
ASHLEY: What kinds?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.240
MATT: "We got wolf meat."

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.611
And you watch as she takes the blade

00:38:03.611 --> 00:38:05.417
and throws it, and

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.170
it sticks into this folded pile

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.490
of somewhat freshly cut,

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.430
still glistening in the lantern light,

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.720
striated muscle, uncooked,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.700
sitting there in the corner.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.660
ASHLEY: Okay. Wolf is good.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.493
SAM: Is it good?

00:38:21.493 --> 00:38:23.600
ASHLEY: It's lean, it's a little gamey, but it's good.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.656
SAM: All right.

00:38:24.656 --> 00:38:26.280
MATT: "We got mammoth."

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.064
SAM: Mammoth?!
ASHLEY: You have what again? Mammoth?

00:38:28.064 --> 00:38:29.820
MATT: And she points over on the far end of the table.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.380
You can see there's a window that's open,

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.020
and hanging in it, there's this heavy,

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.830
heavy, it looks almost like a

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:41.270
a steak side, but it's about three and a half feet long

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.953
and it's hitting the ceiling and then tucking inside.

00:38:43.953 --> 00:38:46.000
And it's left this big red stain

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.033
that's caused the little bit of
snow that's blown in with it

00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:50.570
to also turn a reddish orange around it.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.080
SAM: I'm picturing

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.950
the ribs from the Fred Flintstone--
TALIESIN: Exactly. Exactly.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.230
MATT: Not unlike that. You're not wrong.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.580
SAM: Yeah.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.500
Oh, is mammoth good?

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.463
Is that a good-- is that good?

00:39:02.463 --> 00:39:03.625
MATT: "It's meat."

00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:05.340
TALIESIN: Seems like a--
SAM: Meat, okay.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.890
ASHLEY: I've never had it, so I don't know.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:08.160
TALIESIN: Is mammoth good?

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.390
SAM: She said it's meat.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.620
TALIESIN: Oh, well, then if people like meat,

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.830
then it must be good, I guess.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.721
SAM: And you'd be willing to part with some of this

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:19.971
meat for a price or a trade?

00:39:19.971 --> 00:39:22.050
MATT: "How much you want?"

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:22.913
SAM: Of the meat?

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.390
ASHLEY: Well, we need, you know, for--

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.883
TALIESIN: Most everybody.
SAM: One, two, three, four,

00:39:27.883 --> 00:39:30.610
five, six, six people for a week.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.090
SAM: Yeah.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.131
LIAM: Nine.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.780
MATT: "Wolf?

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.490
"Or mammoth?

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:40.323
"Or both?"

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.570
SAM: If you could describe them,

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:44.970
it would help us decide.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.268
Right now, they're just sort of similar.

00:39:47.268 --> 00:39:50.170
MATT: "Wolves are smaller creatures,

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.180
"covered in thin fur, kind of whitish in color

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.100
"in this region."

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.060
SAM: Yeah.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.040
MATT: "Long snouts. Hunt in packs."

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.050
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.160
MATT: "Mammoths.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.995
"Massive pachyderm-like creatures.

00:40:03.995 --> 00:40:08.040
"Long extended stout with gargantuan tusks.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.610
"Thick, coarse fur covers the entire body.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:14.150
"Also travel in packs, but not hunters.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.438
"More scavengers."

00:40:16.438 --> 00:40:18.898
ASHLEY: And the mammoths are a lot bigger than wolves.

00:40:18.898 --> 00:40:20.673
MATT: "Much bigger."
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:40:20.673 --> 00:40:22.456
TALIESIN: She knows.
SAM: Very good detail.

00:40:22.456 --> 00:40:23.800
TALIESIN: I mean when in doubt,

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.683
I guess you order a flight for people? Is that the--?

00:40:26.683 --> 00:40:29.280
TRAVIS: A flight! (laughs)
ASHLEY: Maybe we can get a little bit of both?

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.440
SAM: Yeah. That's a great idea.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.890
ASHLEY: I'm going to give the meat a sniff.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.970
To make sure it's...

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.410
good.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.750
MATT: You've had meat,

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:45.333
in all stages of freshness in your life.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.450
This is...

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.030
You know, it's not the freshest,

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.070
but it's not...

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.076
It's not going bad.

00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:53.909
TRAVIS: It's fucking cold.
MATT: If anything,

00:40:53.909 --> 00:40:56.570
the temperature helps keep it continuously refrigerated.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.473
So it's got some life on it.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.860
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think we should take a little half and half.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.870
Do you happen to have anything a little bit more exotic?

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.230
Bugs?

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.030
You know, things that are...

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.340
In this region, that Eiselcross is known for?

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.822
SAM: Or vegetables?

00:41:14.822 --> 00:41:17.008
We wouldn't say no to some vegetables.

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:18.741
TALIESIN: I imagine they'd be difficult to get up here,

00:41:18.741 --> 00:41:20.700
but, you know, long shot.
SAM: For sure, you never know.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.730
MATT: "I ain't got vegetables.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.440
"But if you ask around, you might find someone

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.890
"who's brought some with them."

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.133
SAM: Okay.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:41:28.133 --> 00:41:30.135
MATT: "I just work in meat."

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.555
SAM: You're the Meat Woman, then?

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.806
MATT: "I guess."
SAM: Okay, cool, cool.

00:41:37.806 --> 00:41:40.606
TALIESIN: Well, it's nice to <i>meat</i> you, then.

00:41:40.606 --> 00:41:42.205
SAM: Oh.

00:41:42.205 --> 00:41:43.810
LIAM: Wow.
TALIESIN: You can use that.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.093
MATT: "(laughs huskily)

00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:51.226
"(continues laughing)"

00:41:52.907 --> 00:41:53.950
TALIESIN: Oh, oh.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.308
MATT: "I like you."
TALIESIN: Oh, I like you, too.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.630
So we should buy some meat.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.660
SAM: Yes, how much?

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.200
For seven days worth of half and half.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.586
MATT: "Seven days worth for seven, you said?"

00:42:05.586 --> 00:42:06.696
SAM: Six people, but yeah.

00:42:06.696 --> 00:42:08.854
MATT: "Six people.

00:42:14.307 --> 00:42:16.533
"30 gold pieces."

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.540
SAM: It's expensive.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.010
TALIESIN: Well, you've got to remember where we are.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.823
SAM: Sure, if I give you 40 gold,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.700
could you also tell me, what's it like,

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.763
does Wardlow Akron run things around here?

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.873
MATT: "Akron run things for the Assembly, aye."

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:41.150
SAM: And are they a good organizer of things?

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.710
Are they on the up and up

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.253
or are they shady-- shady dealings?

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.340
MATT: "Don't know if you looked around here, Missy,

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.523
"but everyone here's a bit shady."

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:52.585
SAM: True. True.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.690
MATT: "So no, I'd say he fits in quite well."

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:01.015
SAM: And do you know anything about Dagen Underthorn?

00:43:02.235 --> 00:43:04.335
MATT: "That man's a beast."
SAM: A beast?

00:43:04.335 --> 00:43:05.900
MATT: "Been all up and down most parts

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.400
"here in Eiselcross, Foren specifically."

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.200
SAM: But respected?

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.500
MATT: "Aye."

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.420
SAM: Would you...

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.500
would you want him on your side in a battle?

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.226
MATT: "Aye, of course."
SAM: Okay.

00:43:19.226 --> 00:43:21.150
MATT: "And he's brought us some meat himself a few times,

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:22.366
"some of the bigger beasts.

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:24.316
"Took 'em down single-handed, or so he said."

00:43:24.316 --> 00:43:25.349
TRAVIS: Damn.

00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:27.270
TALIESIN: And, just, last question,

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.850
you haven't seen a purple tiefling

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.443
wandering around anytime in the last week or so?

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.460
MATT: "No."
TALIESIN: Ah, worth asking.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.340
MATT: "Don't get many tieflings up here.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.643
"Cold weather and all that."

00:43:38.643 --> 00:43:40.376
TALIESIN: Fair.
MATT: "Is that another joke?"

00:43:42.872 --> 00:43:44.152
TALIESIN: I don't get it.

00:43:44.152 --> 00:43:46.340
MATT: "(laughs huskily)"

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.277
(laughter)

00:43:48.277 --> 00:43:49.327
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.520
ASHLEY: Well...

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.795
SAM: This was a delight.
ASHLEY: This was great.

00:43:53.795 --> 00:43:56.333
Wolf and mammoth, that's what you got?

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.166
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:43:57.166 --> 00:43:59.175
MATT: "All right. Pay up, I'll cut it down for you."

00:43:59.175 --> 00:44:00.841
SAM: Here you go.
ASHLEY: Here, I can--

00:44:00.841 --> 00:44:02.017
SAM: No, it's okay, I got it.

00:44:02.017 --> 00:44:04.180
MATT: She goes ahead and carves down quite a bit of meat

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.234
for what you paid for.

00:44:05.234 --> 00:44:07.193
SAM: You have some butcher paper
or something to put it in?

00:44:07.193 --> 00:44:09.180
MATT: She just throws it into this like--

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.020
SAM: Cool, cool.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.980
MATT: You know, series of small burlap sacks

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.840
that immediately to begins to soak through.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.657
Hands it over.
TALIESIN: That'll be fine.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.933
SAM: Wet meat? Okay, sure.
TALIESIN: I mean...

00:44:20.933 --> 00:44:21.980
LAURA: It'll freeze, it's fine.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.760
MATT: "What's your name, sugar?"

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.943
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.963
Yeah, you!

00:44:28.963 --> 00:44:30.120
TALIESIN: Oh, well.
MATT: "Yeah, the jokester."

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.268
TALIESIN: Ah, Caduceus Clay, it's a pleasure to meet you.

00:44:32.268 --> 00:44:33.623
MATT: "Oh, pleasure."

00:44:33.623 --> 00:44:35.310
"I'm Oweda."

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.018
TALIESIN: Pleasure, Oweda.

00:44:37.018 --> 00:44:41.530
MATT: "Previously a head hunter here in this region.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.950
"Now just sort of a purveyor of meat."

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.245
TALIESIN: How long have you been up here for?

00:44:47.245 --> 00:44:50.750
MATT: "Oh, just about six or so months."

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.180
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.740
It's got to take a toll on you for awhile.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.750
I've never been anywhere this cold before.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.275
MATT: "Yeah. Not a lot of companionship up here."

00:45:00.275 --> 00:45:01.150
SAM: Oh, shit.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.320
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.643
LAURA: Get it, Clay!
TALIESIN: I can imagine.

00:45:03.643 --> 00:45:05.303
TRAVIS: ♪ Come on ride the train ♪

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.560
TALIESIN: Well, if we're done here,

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.408
I guess we've got everything we need.

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.290
SAM: You can stay if you want, we could just--

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.996
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I've got to find some veggies or something.

00:45:14.996 --> 00:45:16.270
ASHLEY: Yeah, because we have so much time,

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:17.630
you probably could stay.
SAM: If you want to stay

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.630
and talk, that's fine.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.680
TALIESIN: Oh, we'll come back later.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.130
It will be nice to see you,
once I come up with another joke,

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:23.090
I'll come on by.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.944
MATT: "Please do."
TALIESIN: I'll be thinking about it.

00:45:24.944 --> 00:45:26.540
MATT: "Okay."

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.465
SAM: All right. I guess we'll leave.

00:45:28.465 --> 00:45:30.758
MATT: "(laughs huskily)"
SAM: Caduceus!

00:45:30.758 --> 00:45:31.633
MATT: "'Meat you!'"

00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:32.763
you hear as you leave.

00:45:34.182 --> 00:45:35.265
SAM: She was into you!

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:38.770
Did you not read that? She was into you!

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.083
TALIESIN: Ah. Really?
ASHLEY: Big time.

00:45:40.083 --> 00:45:41.510
Even I read it.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.384
TALIESIN: Ah, it's, it's nah, I don't
have time for that. That's all right.

00:45:44.384 --> 00:45:45.400
SAM: What do you mean, you don't have time for that?

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.605
We have 40 hours! That's-- you can--

00:45:47.605 --> 00:45:49.706
You guys could have sex 40 times.

00:45:49.706 --> 00:45:51.350
TALIESIN: (laughs)

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.207
Yeah, yeah, no, that's just not...

00:45:53.207 --> 00:45:55.720
I get it. It's not really my thing.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.910
SAM: Are you just not-- not?

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.290
TALIESIN: No, not really.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.030
SAM: Not into her, or just not into--

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.302
TALIESIN: Oh, not into anybody.

00:46:02.302 --> 00:46:04.850
I enjoy what you all have going on.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.140
That's a lot of fun to watch.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:09.850
I mean, not there, specifically, but you know, just,

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.010
we all bounce off each other, it's kind of great.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.600
But nah, it's not really for me.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.266
SAM: It's not your thing?
TALIESIN: No, not my thing.

00:46:15.266 --> 00:46:18.720
SAM: Well, it must free up your mind and heart for--

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.600
TALIESIN: So much.
SAM: So much other stuff.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.833
TALIESIN: Yeah. No.

00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:23.350
Gives me time to think about cooking,

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.800
keeping everybody together, yeah.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.019
SAM: And I, you know, I'm pretty set

00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:30.310
with my hubby, but...

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:32.120
thinking about, you know,

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.330
getting with somebody, or

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.370
coupling or whatever, must take up

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:39.260
a lot of psychic energy, right, Yasha?

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.930
ASHLEY: Oh, I imagine it probably does for some people.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.540
I imagine it probably takes up,

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.047
like every thought in their day.

00:46:46.047 --> 00:46:47.240
SAM: Like, a lotta stress, probably.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.930
ASHLEY: So much stress, probably just, like,

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.557
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:52.500
SAM: Oh, you can't stop thinking about it?

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.120
Or are you just talking hypothetically?

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.710
ASHLEY: No, I'm saying a hypothetical...

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.750
if someone were in that position, you know?

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.129
They would...

00:47:00.129 --> 00:47:01.580
they would think about it all the time

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.050
and probably get really weird around the person.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.560
SAM: Sure, sure.
ASHLEY: I imagine.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.470
TALIESIN: See how much fun this is to watch? It's crazy.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.440
SAM: But that's not something that <i>you</i> feel?

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.050
ASHLEY: No, no. No.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.180
I feel like...

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.433
No, that's not how I feel at all.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:20.690
Just giving you a hypothetical

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.200
because I'm very empathetic and I understand

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.800
where people are coming from.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.153
SAM: All right.

00:47:27.153 --> 00:47:29.153
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding, I'm not very empathetic.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:32.941
TALIESIN: Say, that's-- I recommend the monastery, you know?

00:47:32.941 --> 00:47:35.990
The monastic life is a good vibe for that.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.823
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.748
SAM: Well, we'll take the meat back, I guess.

00:47:40.748 --> 00:47:42.538
TRAVIS: (laughing)

00:47:42.538 --> 00:47:45.412
You have to push the crabgrass beard! (laughs)

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.732
TALIESIN: Can't stop, damn it.

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:51.149
(laughter)

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.305
LAURA: Leave it on forever.

00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:54.294
TRAVIS: Every time you turn your head,

00:47:54.294 --> 00:47:56.450
it's the best thing I've ever seen!

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.110
TALIESIN: I've never seen a plant blush before,

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.185
but it's kind of spectacular.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.406
ASHLEY: Oh god.

00:48:04.406 --> 00:48:05.239
MATT: All right.

00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:07.310
Is there any other-- anything else anybody would like to do?

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:08.800
You have some time.
LAURA: Is there anybody

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.130
just wandering around that I can talk to

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:13.200
when I go outside and I'm building a snowman?

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.660
Is there anybody around to talk to?

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.140
MATT: Okay, so, to get this correct,

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.120
you walked outside and then began building a snowman?

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.030
LAURA: Yes.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.563
MATT: Fuck yes, okay.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.890
First, partway into the snowman,

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.613
you do look around and,

00:48:27.613 --> 00:48:29.060
there are a number of eyes on you.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.590
This is probably not a common occurrence

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.190
here in the middle of Balenpost.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.160
Make a perception check.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.647
LIAM: I am watching.

00:48:37.647 --> 00:48:39.080
MARISHA: I'm watching, too.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:39.913
MATT: All right.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.642
Perception check.
LAURA: That's cocked.

00:48:43.642 --> 00:48:45.583
That's shit.

00:48:45.583 --> 00:48:47.260
MARISHA: Oh, it's not great.
LAURA: Nine!

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.593
MARISHA: Nine!

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.473
MATT: I mean there's people around,
and you can just pick one and go.

00:48:55.626 --> 00:48:56.459
Like, as soon as you start looking around,

00:48:56.459 --> 00:48:57.550
people are just standing there

00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:59.260
in the middle of their business, just looking.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.440
And the moment in any sort of other town

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.810
where everyone would be like, oh,

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:04.550
feel awkward and go about their business,

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.282
they just keep staring.

00:49:06.282 --> 00:49:09.332
LAURA: I just stare at the one that's
staring at me back right now and go:

00:49:09.332 --> 00:49:10.725
Did you want to help?

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.740
Do you want to help? It's really fun.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:17.550
MATT: (low-pitched voice) "No.

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:18.653
"That's silly stuff."

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.760
LAURA: I won't tell anyone.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.343
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:49:26.207 --> 00:49:27.532
LAURA: (whispers) Oh, that's good!

00:49:29.379 --> 00:49:31.195
22.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:38.750
MATT: You see the gentleman who is standing there

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.996
is wearing a--
LAURA: Ooh, The Gentleman.

00:49:40.996 --> 00:49:42.530
MATT: There you go.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.322
A bit of a...

00:49:44.322 --> 00:49:46.100
patchwork bit of leather with a little

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.470
a metal shoulder pauldron on one side,

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:51.040
he looks like he's seen some tough winters.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.260
He has a big scar across his jaw.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.440
And the lip itself is cleft a little bit there

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.410
and healed that way.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:59.470
The kind of person that you'd expect

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.030
to see living in a harsh environment like this

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:03.250
that has survived it and done a good job.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.730
Looks over to one of his compatriots

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:07.720
and hands the shield over to him

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.545
and the spear that he was holding, he goes,

00:50:10.545 --> 00:50:12.200
"I mean, I've just got to make sure that,

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.605
"you know, she's not doing anything untoward."

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:19.493
Walks over puffing his chest out.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.762
"So is this, um...

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.182
"supposed to be some sort of man?"

00:50:27.182 --> 00:50:30.700
LAURA: It's going to be a man; it's a snowman.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.990
But I'm not an expert at doing this, you know?

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.118
Because I grew up in a very warm place.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.860
But will you help me make a ball?

00:50:41.628 --> 00:50:45.150
It should be smaller than the one that I just put down.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.830
MATT: "Yeah, I'll help you with your business."

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:49.923
LAURA: Thanks.

00:50:49.923 --> 00:50:52.120
MATT: Kneels down and starts packing it with you.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.640
LAURA: So what's interesting to do around here?

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.510
Is there anything fun?

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.673
MATT: "I mean there's cards."

00:50:57.673 --> 00:50:58.640
LAURA: Cards!

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.380
MATT: "Cards and dice games in the inside of the fort there.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.380
"Usually around sundown and..."

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.663
LAURA: Oh, that sounds like fun.

00:51:04.663 --> 00:51:06.337
MATT: "There's a lot of fighting."

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:08.590
LAURA: Fighting?

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:11.098
MATT: "Yeah, people get drunk and bored and they fight."

00:51:11.098 --> 00:51:13.810
LAURA: Oh yes, yes. We've done that before, too.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.580
MATT: There's not much else, really.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.597
LAURA: What's going on in Icehaven?

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.006
MATT: "There's some sort of...

00:51:21.006 --> 00:51:23.430
"from what I heard, breakdown in negotiations

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:26.310
"with the Commune of Storm Giants

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.623
"or something there in the Frigid Depths, and.

00:51:29.726 --> 00:51:31.530
"So right now, none of the Empire ships

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:33.230
"can go straight through to the north,

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:34.960
"and it's really messed up

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.220
"our supply line around here."

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.053
LAURA: Oh, wow.

00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:40.660
MATT: "I've been eating nothing but...

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.185
"gristle and grain for about four weeks, and,

00:51:44.185 --> 00:51:45.203
"let me tell you,

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.384
"it's real wrecking on your insides.

00:51:48.384 --> 00:51:50.410
LAURA: I believe you, hold on!

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.573
I pull out one of my pastries.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.423
I get out my rod and I warm it up a little bit

00:51:57.423 --> 00:51:59.110
and I give it to him.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.287
What's your name?

00:52:01.601 --> 00:52:04.071
MATT: "Is this, is this like a...

00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:05.511
"like a baked good?"

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.097
LAURA: It's called a pastry.

00:52:10.203 --> 00:52:12.540
MATT: "Man, I haven't seen one of these in a while."

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.820
LAURA: They're really tasty.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.200
That one's cherry flavored.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.070
MATT: "I've got to confiscate this, you know?"

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.933
LAURA: Oh, of course. What's your name?

00:52:19.933 --> 00:52:21.459
TRAVIS: With my mouth. (laughs)

00:52:21.459 --> 00:52:22.580
MATT: (inaudible through a mouth of food)

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.700
LAURA: Huh?
SAM: Kiri?

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.675
MATT: "Keylen."
SAM: Oh.

00:52:24.675 --> 00:52:27.481
LAURA: Keylen? That's a good name.

00:52:27.481 --> 00:52:28.880
MATT: "Thank you, what's your name?"

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.071
LAURA: I'm Jester.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:32.957
MATT: "Jester, you're...

00:52:34.425 --> 00:52:37.940
"Not the usual kind of person that comes through here."

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.560
LAURA: Yes, we are a very unusual sort of group.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.998
MATT: "Just be careful."

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.375
LAURA: Okay.

00:52:45.375 --> 00:52:46.208
Of what?

00:52:47.757 --> 00:52:49.590
MATT: He gestures.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:51.337
He's like, "All of it."

00:52:51.337 --> 00:52:52.430
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: "I mean,

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.230
"those walls are there for a reason."

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:55.129
LAURA: Right.

00:52:55.129 --> 00:52:57.646
MATT: "How long are you staying?
"Are you heading back on boat?"

00:52:57.646 --> 00:52:59.120
LAURA: No, we're actually heading out--

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.511
MATT: "This is incredible, by the way."

00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:01.783
LAURA: I know, right?

00:53:01.783 --> 00:53:03.570
I don't know how long we're staying,

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.280
I'm not exactly sure what we're doing,

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.099
but our boat left, so. (stammers)

00:53:09.099 --> 00:53:10.400
MATT: "Okay, well,

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.670
"just don't go too far out past the walls there.

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:14.300
"There's all sorts of nasties

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:15.760
"that live out there in the ice."

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.296
LAURA: All right.

00:53:17.296 --> 00:53:19.360
Thank you...

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.432
Keylen?

00:53:20.432 --> 00:53:21.770
MATT: "Keylen."

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:22.603
LAURA: Thank you, Keylen.

00:53:22.603 --> 00:53:25.440
MATT: "No worries."
LAURA: Maybe I'll see you playing cards?

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.800
MATT: "Yeah, if you play cards.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.680
"Careful though.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.540
"There's a rough bunch that usually throws down, so...

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.360
"I'd recommend maybe just watching

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.943
"before you go in too deep."

00:53:35.947 --> 00:53:37.714
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "Some egos."

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.653
LAURA: Oh, okay. Good to know.

00:53:41.936 --> 00:53:42.769
MATT: "Thank you."

00:53:42.769 --> 00:53:44.463
LAURA: Thank you for helping me build this.

00:53:46.107 --> 00:53:48.612
MATT: And he goes and takes a little copper piece

00:53:48.612 --> 00:53:51.011
out of his pocket and makes the nose.

00:53:51.011 --> 00:53:52.000
LAURA: Yeah!

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.383
MATT: Stands up, finishes it.

00:53:55.002 --> 00:53:56.656
"Don't let me catch you doing that again."

00:53:56.656 --> 00:53:59.300
LAURA: Okay. Yes, sir, you got it, sir.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.150
MATT: Walks over and grabs the shield and spear.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.790
The guy over there hands it to him like,

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:05.280
"Are you serious?" giving that look.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.220
And he's like, "Shut up." (sniffs)

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.440
Quickly shuffles off back

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.690
to doing his walk around the perimeter.

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:14.190
LIAM: Yeah, a couple of minutes back,

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:17.270
I started to build a snowman at Beauregard's feet.

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:19.310
A big one. Are you going to help me do this?

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:21.320
This is what they do here, so.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.610
MARISHA: I just kick it.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:23.963
Whatever you started.

00:54:23.963 --> 00:54:26.137
(laughter)

00:54:26.137 --> 00:54:29.220
MATT: You hear, you hear, a faint--

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.800
especially at both of your passive perceptions,

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.340
a faint cacophony of about seven or eight

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.550
different voices chuckle the minute it happens

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:37.700
in the vicinity.

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:40.910
MARISHA: Sorry, I'll...

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:43.450
let's build a snowman.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.840
LIAM: Okay, but you build that

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.870
because I did all that work for the last minute

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.520
so you'll have to make up for it.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:51.420
MARISHA: Just take a glob of snow,

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.200
pelt him in the face with it.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.934
SAM: Jesus!
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:54:54.934 --> 00:54:56.930
LIAM: Keep going, though, please.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:00.470
MARISHA: Pelting you in the face with snowballs? Okay.

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:03.420
LAURA: I pelt Beau in the face
with a snowball from a distance.

00:55:04.847 --> 00:55:05.680
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.000
MARISHA: It's got some ice in it.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.950
Stings, man, it stings a little.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:09.783
I pelt her back!

00:55:09.783 --> 00:55:10.788
LAURA: Argh!
MATT: (chuckles)

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.049
LAURA: Yeah, full on snow fight.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.951
MARISHA: Snow fight!

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:17.420
TRAVIS: I cast Disintegrate on...

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.279
(laughter)

00:55:20.279 --> 00:55:22.160
ASHLEY: We got some meat!

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.370
MATT: Yeah, as you guys walk up,

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:24.390
you immediately see--
MARISHA: I pop Yasha.

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.130
MATT: -- in the middle of this, your friends are starting

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:29.660
the most localized snowball fight.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.712
And in the middle of, I don't know,

00:55:32.712 --> 00:55:36.111
essentially the wall in "Game of Thrones,"

00:55:36.111 --> 00:55:39.450
like, no one here would ever be in a snow fight,

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.162
but yet here in the middle of the Night's Watch

00:55:43.162 --> 00:55:45.143
are your friends throwing snowballs.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:47.343
ASHLEY: This makes sense.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:52.000
LIAM: I would like to cast Telekinesis on Beauregard

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.310
and throw her into a snowdrift.

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.360
SAM: Nice!
LAURA, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: (gasps)

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.946
MATT: Oh, go ahead and make a save on that.

00:55:56.946 --> 00:55:58.160
What's the save?
LAURA: That's awesome!

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:58.993
LIAM: 18.

00:55:58.993 --> 00:56:00.564
MATT: 18, and what's--
LIAM: Strength.

00:56:00.564 --> 00:56:01.535
MATT: Strength!

00:56:01.535 --> 00:56:04.370
MARISHA: Oh, definitely fail, I rolled a five.

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:05.650
So 10 total.

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:06.483
LIAM: Hey, buddy.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.795
Payback is a bitch (whooshing).

00:56:09.795 --> 00:56:11.520
MATT: And immediately you're lifted in the air

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.150
like some mysterious hand just grabbed you

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:15.820
and held you like a limp puppet

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.810
and then chucks you into the snowbank nearby. Boof!

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:20.570
This large snow explosion

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:23.370
and all the guards that were watching at this point,

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:25.393
chuckling, all of a sudden go like,

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.880
and there's a quiet hush that falls over them

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.930
as they realize there's a little more

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:34.885
to these wandering fuckheads.

00:56:34.885 --> 00:56:36.388
(laughter)

00:56:36.388 --> 00:56:40.646
MARISHA: I just, out of the snowdrift, give him a thumbs up.

00:56:40.646 --> 00:56:41.894
(strained) That was really good.

00:56:41.894 --> 00:56:43.930
You knocked the air out of me. It was really good.

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:45.530
LAURA: Can you do it to me?

00:56:47.264 --> 00:56:49.150
LIAM: Yeah. You ready?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to go!

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:50.180
LIAM: Which one? Do you want to go into

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.539
the near one or the far one?

00:56:51.539 --> 00:56:52.410
LAURA: The fluffy one!

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:53.950
LIAM: The fluffy one?

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:55.512
No, I'll do the far one instead.

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:56.408
(whooshing)

00:56:56.408 --> 00:56:58.710
MATT: (laughs) You don't even try and save?

00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:59.851
LAURA: No!
MATT: Nope.

00:57:01.076 --> 00:57:01.916
(little whoosh)

00:57:01.916 --> 00:57:03.120
(big whoosh)
LAURA: (screams)

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.557
MATT: At an intense speed, but not so much to point

00:57:05.557 --> 00:57:09.021
to hurt you, you hit it like

00:57:09.021 --> 00:57:11.360
a bunch of really cold icy pillows.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.830
You just collide and you guys see--

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:16.770
you don't see an explosion as much as you see

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:19.230
this outline of Jester's body

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:22.120
just sink immediately into the snowbank.

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:22.960
TRAVIS: Like sleet-y?

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.018
MATT: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:57:24.018 --> 00:57:26.097
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.
LAURA: That was not

00:57:26.097 --> 00:57:28.401
as fluffy as I expected,

00:57:28.401 --> 00:57:30.570
but still really fun.
MATT: This one's made just for me.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:32.230
MARISHA: Yeah!
(laughter)

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:33.063
MATT: But yeah.

00:57:33.063 --> 00:57:34.550
LIAM: I hope we do not get into a brawl today.

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:36.010
That took a lot of effort.

00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:37.357
(laughter)

00:57:37.357 --> 00:57:38.190
LIAM: Worth it.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.423
I go back to building my snowman.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.250
LAURA: That was awesome!

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.660
LIAM: And I'm going to put two heads on the snowman

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.220
and I'm going to, with a stick,

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.660
draw sort of a smiley face on one

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.150
and a frowny (grunts) on the other one.

00:57:56.150 --> 00:58:00.779
And when Beauregard limps over, I say: Look, that's us.

00:58:00.779 --> 00:58:04.470
MARISHA: Aw, it is, but which one's-- wait.

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.325
Who's the happy one and who's the sad one?

00:58:07.325 --> 00:58:08.850
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:09.683
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:58:09.683 --> 00:58:13.307
LIAM: I rub over the smile and I make a little frown.

00:58:13.307 --> 00:58:16.010
We're both frowning.
MARISHA: That feels right, yeah.

00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:17.355
That looks better.

00:58:19.052 --> 00:58:20.933
LIAM: We should probably find some lodging.

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:24.137
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Oh yes.

00:58:24.137 --> 00:58:27.193
MARISHA: Are we staying in that
outpost, in the military barracks?

00:58:27.193 --> 00:58:29.831
TALIESIN: I can't imagine there's a lot of options.

00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:32.100
MARISHA: I don't think this is a place with a tavern.

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.730
TALIESIN: Maybe a room with a drink.
SAM: Do you need

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:36.160
a closet to make your--

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.443
LIAM: No, just privacy.

00:58:37.443 --> 00:58:41.570
MATT: To clarify, because I may have just glossed over it

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.067
or forgotten to--

00:58:43.067 --> 00:58:45.978
but you do have rooms prepared for you in the main fort.

00:58:45.978 --> 00:58:47.190
SAM: Oh, great.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:50.840
MATT: Bottom floor, but you do have three chambers

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.940
that have been assigned to you all.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.670
You haven't been to them yet necessarily,

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.470
but they were pointed out to you as you entered.

00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:58.885
LIAM: Okay, well, party in room three tonight.

00:58:58.885 --> 00:58:59.718
LAURA: Yeah!

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:01.523
SAM: Great.

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.748
TALIESIN: Third floor is the party floor, so.

00:59:07.796 --> 00:59:09.210
SAM: Is there anything else we need to do?

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:12.760
Is there anyone we need to scry on, message?

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.162
LAURA: Yeah, I was planning on scrying on...

00:59:15.162 --> 00:59:16.490
LIAM: Did you find the provisions?

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:17.460
SAM: We have meat.
TALIESIN: We've got meat.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.360
ASHLEY: We have meat. They don't really have

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:22.500
stuff maybe for--
TALIESIN: Not meat.

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.620
ASHLEY: They don't have not-meat.

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:26.460
We just have straight meat.
LIAM: You are looking a little

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.573
green around the gills.

00:59:27.573 --> 00:59:28.406
Are you all right?

00:59:28.406 --> 00:59:29.239
LAURA: Some change.

00:59:29.239 --> 00:59:31.420
TALIESIN: I can also take some of
the meat and grow some mushrooms.

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.703
ASHLEY: I'm feeling okay.
LIAM: Was the butcher's

00:59:32.703 --> 00:59:33.936
a little much for you?

00:59:33.936 --> 00:59:38.000
SAM: No, the butcher was actually-- she was pretty randy.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.150
ASHLEY: Yeah, she was--

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:42.586
SAM: So Caleb, you know, if you want some...

00:59:42.586 --> 00:59:44.856
TALIESIN: Apparently the butcher was into me, too.

00:59:44.856 --> 00:59:45.837
That was a thing.
LAURA: Really?

00:59:45.837 --> 00:59:48.868
ASHLEY: Yeah, very much so.
MARISHA: Wait, Caduceus got hit on?

00:59:48.868 --> 00:59:50.080
And I missed it?!

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.010
TALIESIN: Pretty cool.

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:53.010
I missed it too, if it makes you feel better.

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:55.720
LIAM: How did you miss it? You are so perceptive.

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.737
TALIESIN: Hmm?
LIAM: You are so perceptive.

00:59:57.737 --> 00:59:59.970
TALIESIN: Well, you know, it's-- other people are easy.

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:03.103
LIAM: Ah, ah, yeah, that makes sense.

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:05.860
MARISHA: Hmm.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.470
TALIESIN: Yeah, didn't pick up on it. It's weird.

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:09.440
ASHLEY: Yeah, she was great.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.870
We got some mammoth meat and we have some wolf meat.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:14.150
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Ooh.

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:15.640
ASHLEY: So for you guys,

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.270
we need to figure out some salad.

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:19.480
LIAM: Wolf meat is good.
ASHLEY: Roughage.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.313
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:20.313 --> 01:00:22.380
TALIESIN: We can try both and decide what we like.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.300
SAM: Yeah, we'll do a tasting.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.190
TALIESIN: Get a little fire going.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.850
MARISHA: Should we make a stew or something?

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:30.740
TALIESIN: I was thinking of doing a kebab thing.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.300
MARISHA: Oh, that sounds great.
LAURA: A kebab?

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.710
TALIESIN: Think I've got something
I can turn into a rub.

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:35.940
It'll be good.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.497
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:37.497 --> 01:00:39.180
(laughter)

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.060
TRAVIS: I just realized that maybe only worse

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:42.750
than shopping would be cooking.

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:47.250
(laughter)
(clapping)

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.240
SAM: Let's real time role play roasting meat.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.868
LIAM: Everybody make performance checks.

01:00:54.868 --> 01:00:56.258
(laughter)

01:00:56.258 --> 01:00:58.160
MATT: We're not quite at 300 degrees,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.660
about five more minutes or so.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.873
TRAVIS: I check.

01:01:01.873 --> 01:01:02.870
No no, keep the door closed.

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:04.263
MATT: Yeah, keep it closed.

01:01:04.263 --> 01:01:05.270
That's a couple more minutes--
LIAM: Roll to see if it collapses.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.110
MATT: -- to the final time for it.

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.090
TALIESIN: Especially fun if you have
to build the oven out of clay.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.321
SAM: Oh god, no!
LAURA: Oh god!

01:01:10.321 --> 01:01:11.570
TRAVIS: Please no.

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.430
MATT: That's what high level cleric spells are for.

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.580
LAURA: I am going to scry again.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.641
MATT: On?

01:01:16.641 --> 01:01:18.757
LAURA: Molly.
MATT: On Molly? Okay.

01:01:18.757 --> 01:01:20.340
TRAVIS: You want to head back to our room?

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:22.276
LAURA: Yeah, sure, might as well.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:01:22.276 --> 01:01:24.160
SAM: Is there anything else we need to do?

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.022
No, right?

01:01:25.022 --> 01:01:25.877
TRAVIS: We don't know yet.
LAURA: I'm sure there's something,

01:01:25.877 --> 01:01:26.710
but we're not doing it.

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:28.770
SAM: All right, I'll go back to the room.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:30.760
MATT: You guys got here mid day or so

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.670
and wandering around, figuring things out,

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.610
it's starting to get to dusk.

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:35.443
SAM: Great.

01:01:35.443 --> 01:01:37.330
MATT: And meals are about to be prepared

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:39.630
or what little bit of food is being prepared

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:42.520
for your arrival is starting to be gathered downstairs.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.510
So as you guys walk into the fort,

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:48.210
you can see now Lady Vess has already taken a seat.

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:50.410
There's this one elevated table that's apart

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:52.350
from all the rest of the tables in the chamber.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.890
It's placed on what was once a little storage platform

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:57.610
that's been cleared and it's been--

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:02.010
it's noticeably more polished and clean

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.310
and trying to be more of a presentory space

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.650
for an esteemed member of the Assembly.

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:09.130
So by comparison, it looks leaps and bounds

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:10.290
above anything else in the chamber,

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:11.840
but it's still pretty ramshackle.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.360
It's no Tri-Spires of Zadash, mind you.

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:20.883
But if you guys would like to eat, you may.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.410
SAM: Yeah, do it.
MATT: All right.

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:26.970
As you can see, a number of other individuals

01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:28.370
that work within the fort begin to gather

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.270
and take their seats and meal.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.920
Dagen Underthorn goes ahead and makes his way

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.080
to his own table and sits a bit,

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.080
having this thick hock of roast of some beast

01:02:42.021 --> 01:02:43.250
and just sits there and tears into it

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.670
while keeping an eye on the rest of you

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.670
And notices when you're looking over

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:46.960
and gives a thumbs up.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.210
You see bits and chunks of meat in his beard.

01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:52.921
LAURA: Do I see Keylen?

01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:54.533
MATT: You do not see Keylen here, no.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.279
LAURA: I made a friend.

01:02:57.279 --> 01:02:58.812
TRAVIS: You did?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:02:58.812 --> 01:02:59.778
TRAVIS: Where, outside?

01:02:59.778 --> 01:03:01.770
LAURA: Mm-hmm, he helped me build a snowman.

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.065
TRAVIS: He helped you build a snowman?

01:03:03.065 --> 01:03:04.568
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:03:04.568 --> 01:03:07.480
LAURA: But I also found out about Icehaven?

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.660
TRAVIS: You found out more?

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.519
LAURA: Well, something about storm giants?

01:03:11.519 --> 01:03:12.609
Did I hear that right?

01:03:12.609 --> 01:03:13.442
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:03:13.442 --> 01:03:14.740
TRAVIS: Storm giants?

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:18.260
LAURA: Yeah, they're blocking the trade route or something.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.923
TRAVIS: In the water or on the land?

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.180
LAURA: In the land?

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.805
MATT: You gathered it was probably in the water.

01:03:23.805 --> 01:03:24.638
LAURA: In the water.

01:03:24.638 --> 01:03:26.180
MATT: They're actually beneath the waves,

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.200
and you would know this in your travels,

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.450
like storm giants, some societies of storm giants

01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:33.350
are just beneath the waves.
TRAVIS: Very bad.

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.183
LAURA: Oh wow.

01:03:34.183 --> 01:03:38.920
TRAVIS: Very, very, very world ending, your day wrecker bad.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.717
LAURA: Oh, well then, it's good we didn't go there.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:42.550
TRAVIS: Very much so.

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:43.383
LAURA: Yeah.

01:03:43.383 --> 01:03:44.985
TRAVIS: That's not where we're going, is it?

01:03:44.985 --> 01:03:45.818
LAURA: I don't think so.

01:03:45.818 --> 01:03:47.000
SAM: Do you have a map?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.350
Where is it?
TRAVIS: I do. It's over here.

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.220
SAM: No, I mean where's Icehaven?

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.230
TRAVIS: It's up.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.180
SAM: Oh shit, okay.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.680
LAURA: It's over there.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.670
MATT: Icehaven's on the southwestern edge

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:00.073
of the Dwendalian Empire.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.013
SAM: Oh.

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:06.210
MATT: Of the Dwendalian Empire.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.826
TRAVIS: Yep, wrong map.

01:04:07.826 --> 01:04:10.199
Just enjoying this one.
(laughter)

01:04:10.199 --> 01:04:11.705
Enjoying this one.
LIAM: Cap'n!

01:04:11.705 --> 01:04:12.809
TRAVIS: Good map.

01:04:12.809 --> 01:04:14.459
Good map.
LAURA: Good map, solid map.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:18.500
TRAVIS: You just go on, do your stuff.

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.850
MATT: But it's fun to just stare at you in silence.

01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:23.190
TRAVIS: (nervous yelp)

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:25.620
LAURA: Had we heard about Icehaven before?

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.453
TRAVIS: There it is, yep.

01:04:26.453 --> 01:04:28.913
MATT: You've probably heard of it in passing.

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.200
You would know about it more than anybody,

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.723
you and Beauregard.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.750
Possibly you as well, Veth, somewhat,

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:39.130
but it's the northwestern-most

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.210
trade post city within the Empire.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.681
It's an older town.
TRAVIS: North of Pride's Call.

01:04:43.681 --> 01:04:44.514
MATT: Yeah.

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:46.748
It's one of the older towns
that was originally established--

01:04:46.748 --> 01:04:47.581
TRAVIS: Over here.

01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:49.780
MATT: -- when the Zemni Fields were first settled

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.840
into the early stages of the Dwendalian Empire.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.475
But it's-- it's a very--

01:04:55.090 --> 01:05:00.090
it's a very rough and tumble frozen coast town

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.320
in the Dwendalian empire.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.666
And normally the-- and the only port town in the Empire,

01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:07.630
because the rest of it is landlocked.

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.108
So generally a lot of, you know,

01:05:09.108 --> 01:05:11.691
anything that needs shipping towards Tal'Dorei

01:05:11.691 --> 01:05:13.640
or any areas westward,

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.410
they would try and make their way through the Frigid Depths

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:17.430
on the north side and then head westward

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:19.320
and technically, it would be a much straighter shot

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.300
from the Empire to Eiselcross.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.500
But apparently this is an issue.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.333
LIAM: A problem.

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:27.300
And we're the fringe, right?

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.460
This is the barest edge of what could be considered

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.980
the Empire at this point?

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.650
MATT: Yes, and this isn't even
part of the Empire, technically.

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:36.580
This is just-- this post is Empire territory

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.791
being held by the interest of the Cerberus Assembly.

01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:39.624
TRAVIS: Balenpost?

01:05:39.624 --> 01:05:40.951
MATT: Balenpost, yeah.
LIAM: This is the thing.

01:05:40.951 --> 01:05:42.100
LAURA: Got it.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.520
TRAVIS: So did we pass Tyre-- Taergoss?

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.894
Taergoss?

01:05:46.894 --> 01:05:47.860
MATT: You would have, yeah.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.693
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:05:48.693 --> 01:05:50.830
If we'd been able to see past the mist.

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:51.663
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:05:51.663 --> 01:05:52.610
MATT: Sorry about that.

01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:54.780
TRAVIS: No apologies.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.020
MATT: But as you guys are in here,

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.930
you begin to find a place to eat

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.310
or a table to make yourselves.

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:03.940
And then you watch as a person

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.930
comes up to your table and goes,

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:08.910
"Sorry to bother you, but Lady Vess DeRogna

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:12.070
"is requesting you actually join her at her table."

01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:12.903
LAURA: The high one?

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:13.820
MATT: And points over and you can see now

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:16.340
the table where she's at, they push two more tables up

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.000
and there's some chairs being assembled right now.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:18.833
And as you look over,

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:20.840
she just gives a finger wave like.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.355
SAM: Oh, okay.
TRAVIS: Damn.

01:06:23.395 --> 01:06:24.495
LAURA: Cool.
TALIESIN: Apparently a little

01:06:24.495 --> 01:06:25.328
pomp and circumstance.

01:06:25.328 --> 01:06:26.360
SAM: She's paying by the way.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.890
Let's establish this before we walk over there.

01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:30.890
We can offer once,

01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:31.960
but she's paying.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.200
LAURA: I think... okay.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.033
LIAM: This is probably--

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.143
SAM: We'll offer to be polite.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.250
But then she'll say, no, no, no.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:41.042
And we leave it at that. We don't try to push.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:42.070
LAURA: (giggling) Okay.

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:43.704
TRAVIS: That's a courtesy thing, offering once

01:06:43.704 --> 01:06:45.532
and then, "You pay."
SAM: Yeah, we offer, we offer.

01:06:45.532 --> 01:06:46.910
But it's her, she's doing it.

01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:49.090
ASHLEY: Why would you offer it if you're not going to do it?

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:50.660
SAM: It's polite.

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.380
ASHLEY: But what if you say we'll do it and then--

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.213
TRAVIS: She says yes.

01:06:53.213 --> 01:06:54.720
SAM: Then she is horrible.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.500
ASHLEY: Oh.
SAM: She needs to say, "No, no, no,

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.808
"I got this."

01:06:57.808 --> 01:06:59.678
TRAVIS: Seems like opening a window for--

01:06:59.678 --> 01:07:01.840
LAURA: Aren't you supposed to offer
again, though, after that?

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.690
SAM: You are, but this time we're not

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:05.150
because she should really pay.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.150
LIAM: Technically, I think this is part of our per diem,

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:10.000
so it's probably covered already.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.323
TRAVIS: This feels like compounding rules.

01:07:11.323 --> 01:07:12.990
TALIESIN: I just assume everyone splits their check.

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.208
Isn't that the way it's done?
LAURA: Can we just go?

01:07:15.208 --> 01:07:16.640
Let's just fucking sit down.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.600
SAM: Let's go sit down.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.150
MATT: All right.
(laughter)

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.240
LIAM: Always tip nine percent.
TALIESIN: Save me.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.300
MATT: You can see some of the individuals

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.260
are scrambling to gather

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.320
matching or at least somewhat nicer utensils and

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.600
drink receptacles in comparison

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.470
to what Vess has already placed before her.

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:38.760
And as you guys eventually find this--

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.110
it's when you ever go into your kitchen

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.070
and you realize you've bought multiple dish sets

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.130
over the years, but you've lost half of each.

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.880
So now it's just this mishmash that doesn't match anything.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.940
Your table is just a kaleidoscope

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.040
of weird, gathered implements.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.120
LIAM: Oh yeah, that's my house.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.010
MATT: Yeah, there you go.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:08:00.190
But there is a-- three wine bottles have been procured

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.030
and opened and drinks are being poured

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:03.580
and meals are being gathered

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.250
as Vess, sitting there at her seat,

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.803
she takes her wineglass.

01:08:09.328 --> 01:08:12.180
"Well, welcome to Eiselcross, eh?"

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.110
TRAVIS: Happy to be here.

01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:16.163
MATT: "Quite the journey.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:21.090
"I heard from the captain, Kem,

01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:26.090
"that there was quite a bit of
business during the trek, yes?"

01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:31.810
TRAVIS: It was indeed a bit more
than I think even we anticipated.

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:34.950
The weather out here is (laughter) choice.

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:36.967
MATT: "Oh, it's only going to get better.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:41.260
"But I was both surprised and

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.490
"impressed that I was not called for nor required

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:46.900
"to take care of such

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:49.993
"a encounter.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.300
"And as such, you prove once again to be as useful

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.990
"as I hoped you would be."

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:59.250
MARISHA: Oh, we just didn't think
that would be your kind of fun.

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.580
MATT: "I don't get to see action too very often,

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.290
"but I do like that I don't have to do too much

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:06.750
"if I don't need to.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:09.760
"As those of the arcane pursuit would know,

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.620
"sometimes it's best to keep

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.069
"your most important reserves at the ready."

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:19.190
LIAM: Yes, you never want to squander
them on frivolous things.

01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:21.860
MATT: "Indeed."
(laughter)

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.760
MATT: As she pours your cup.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.641
TRAVIS: As she sees the two imprints
of people out in the snow.

01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:30.890
LIAM: Looney Tunes, like a Jester hole

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.620
in the snowbank outside.

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:37.960
MATT: "So, Dagen is a very accomplished explorer

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.190
"and will taking us through and northward

01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:46.810
"around the outskirts of the river,

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:48.981
"River of Flame."

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.685
LAURA: Fire ring.
TRAVIS: What?

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:53.700
MATT: "There will be a required crossing of it.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.900
"But thankfully I have

01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:01.730
"the ability to negate that challenge when we reach it."

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:04.020
LAURA: Like you can make us fly or you can make it cold

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.313
or you make a bridge or you can just--

01:10:06.313 --> 01:10:07.730
MATT: "Well, it's far too wide for me to turn--

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:10.280
"oh, the thing is nearly a mile across."

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.450
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Wow.

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:12.283
LAURA: That's a lot.

01:10:12.283 --> 01:10:14.500
TRAVIS: It's a big river.
MATT: "But flight and such things

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.460
"I can take care of."

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.560
LIAM: How many times have you made the journey before?

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.393
MATT: "Only once."

01:10:18.393 --> 01:10:19.226
LIAM: Oh.

01:10:19.226 --> 01:10:22.910
MATT: "Which is why Dagen will be so necessary for this,

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:24.680
"but then not too far beyond then,

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.653
"we will make our way to the primary excavation site.

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:31.690
"Then we shall to see what we find."

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.390
MARISHA: How many days are you anticipating this journey?

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:38.670
MATT: "With Dagen's aid and without any serious issues?

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:41.270
"I imagine this will take us about a week and a half."

01:10:42.735 --> 01:10:43.611
TRAVIS: It's a big ass map.

01:10:43.611 --> 01:10:45.694
TALIESIN: Without serious issues.

01:10:46.723 --> 01:10:47.940
MATT: "Well, it is a dangerous place.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.710
"That is why I brought you along with me."

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:51.600
TALIESIN: Two weeks.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.920
SAM: And just in case we need to make

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.360
a quick getaway for whatever reasons,

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.540
no teleporting is allowed around here?

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.150
MATT: You see the expression on her face turn a little,

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:07.850
a little anxious, and she goes,

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:09.508
"I mean, it is possible.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:11.253
"It is just,

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:17.890
"it's a dangerous roll of the dice, you would say."

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.420
SAM: I've not heard that term before.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:23.030
LAURA: What could happen if you, if it went wrong?

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:25.180
If it went poorly?

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.930
MATT: "Well, sometimes it can send you to a place

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:32.490
"you have no idea where it intended to bring you.

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:35.710
"It could drop you in the middle of nowhere or

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:39.100
"it can tear you apart."

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.230
SAM: Oh!

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:43.908
MARISHA: You sound as if you're
speaking like you've seen this.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:45.332
MATT: "I have."

01:11:45.332 --> 01:11:46.180
MARISHA: Ah, yeah.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.180
MATT: "I made my first journey away from Eiselcross

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.570
"through these means, even with the warnings

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.610
"that were placed before me, but

01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.810
"no one likes to believe that they themselves

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:01.360
"have to play by the same rules,

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:05.963
"but it proved to be challenging.

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.130
"I survived, thankfully,

01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:10.980
"but there are those before me that have not.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.740
"And some that have just never been found.

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.820
"So it can be done, but I would ensure

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.225
"that it is a last possible measure."

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:26.270
TALIESIN: That's teleportation magic,
what about other magic?

01:12:27.205 --> 01:12:30.490
Does magic get weird across the board or--

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:31.476
MATT: "It can.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.360
"Most magic here in Eiselcross functions as intended,

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.713
"but sometimes there are abnormalities,

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:45.680
"bursts of unexpected after-effects that can

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.370
"cause issues for yourself

01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:53.630
"or whoever is the subject of your magical

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:56.670
"fiddling."

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:58.470
LIAM: How frequent a phenomenon is that?

01:12:59.650 --> 01:13:01.220
MATT: "Not too terribly frequent,

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.443
"but it has been known to happen on occasion."

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:07.230
LAURA: This music is great here.

01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:08.738
SAM: Yeah, is there a player?

01:13:08.738 --> 01:13:10.660
MATT: There is, actually, you can see there's--

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.050
Which, for the record, while the music here is good,

01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:14.223
the band playing in-world: not as good.

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.460
You get the sense that there isn't a usual,

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.950
like, band of musicians,

01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:20.780
but there are people that have been brought together

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.110
because of the presence of the Archmage of Antiquity

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.307
from the Cerberus Assembly and forced to perform.

01:13:25.307 --> 01:13:26.630
MARISHA: "Jim plays bass."

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:27.860
MATT: Yeah, kind of.
(laughter)

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:31.350
And so they're all a bunch of just rough-looking people

01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:34.130
that work here that are all forced to play together

01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:35.270
and they're kind of jamming

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:36.870
and it's not quite working, but you know,

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.181
it's better than awkward silence and chewing noises, so.

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.230
TRAVIS: (strings plucking)

01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:42.653
Family in a rock band.

01:13:42.653 --> 01:13:44.443
LAURA: You should play some bagpipe with them.

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:46.522
TRAVIS: Who are you speaking to?

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:49.279
(laughter)

01:13:49.279 --> 01:13:51.750
MATT: "But we do have quite a journey ahead of us.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.410
"I would recommend before the night is out

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:56.070
"to speak a bit with Mr. Underthorn

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.470
"and between your group and him,

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.420
"best understand what we may have

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.560
"awaiting us on this journey."

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.393
SAM: Where is he?

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.080
MATT: She points over to the table where he's still sitting.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.660
He's finished most of his meal,

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:14.240
but he's now on his fourth cup of spirits.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.360
SAM: Okay.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.630
MATT: And it looks like he's just

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:20.744
looking over the table, just patting his stomach.

01:14:20.744 --> 01:14:22.890
"(burps)"
TRAVIS: Doing good, doing good.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:24.550
MATT: Yeah.

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:25.930
LAURA: How will we know when we've done

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:26.930
what we're supposed to do?

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.980
Are you looking for something particular?

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:34.860
MATT: "When we've acquired enough remnant information

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:37.930
"of Aeor that pertains to either

01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:43.523
"the recovery of powerful artifacts.

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:47.230
"I've taken rubbings of, before,

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:51.210
"of various symbols and information

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:53.880
"that was scavenged or found within the architecture there,

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.400
"that itself contains partial equations and information

"about what they were in the process of developing

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:04.120
"as well as what they used to protect the city itself."

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.200
LAURA: Oh wow.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.087
MATT: "There are..."

01:15:06.087 --> 01:15:09.303
And you see this sparkle in her eyes as she speaks.

01:15:09.303 --> 01:15:10.940
For all the times you've known her,

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:14.950
she's been very reserved, but you see this passion

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:16.763
and this smile she can't quite hide.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.043
"It is incredible.

01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:23.230
"All of the various things that they had done

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:28.163
"and were working to do in Aeor before the Calamity.

"Who knows what we could do

"if we were even just to understand some of it today."

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.610
LIAM: And do you have a laundry list of specifics,

01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:38.710
or are we just here until you have sated yourself

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.830
with new discoveries?
MATT: "I have some ideas,

01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:43.793
"but more the latter."

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:48.600
LAURA: Have you been to this particular structure

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.100
before that we're going to?

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.160
MATT: "I've only been but maybe

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.960
"a small toe dip within, if you will,

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.360

"And at the time when I returned,

"after a challenging departure,

"as I previously explained,

"the conflict began to grow with the Dynasty,

"and the Assembly decided my focuses were required elsewhere

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:23.223
"in other types of research."

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:27.010
LIAM: How many of the Assembly

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.854
have interest in your dealings here?

01:16:29.854 --> 01:16:32.430
Are any of them following your exploits?

01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:34.840
MATT: "I check in, so all of them are made aware

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.640
"of what I'm doing to an extent."

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:41.723
LIAM: Do any come close to your avid interest?

01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:44.960
MATT: "I'm not the only member that has made trek

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.343
"to the north, though it is my priority.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.163
"And I assure them that I've got it handled,

"such a family as ours."

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.603
LIAM: I'm curious, how goes the family these days?

01:17:08.868 --> 01:17:11.284
MATT: "Well, it--

01:17:11.284 --> 01:17:13.317
"it maintains its balance.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.680
"Everyone trusts and mistrusts each other

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.700
"to maintain balance.

"War was

"avoided outwardly, thanks to your aid as well.

"which is why I'm here with you."

01:17:40.331 --> 01:17:43.830
LIAM: What of King Dwendal?

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.080
MATT: "He is informed of these interests,

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.903
"but we filter information as he's needed to know it.

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:05.880
"He is less interested in ancient history

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.140
"and more focused in current

01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:14.683
"history, which, to be honest, is how I prefer it anyway."

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:20.590
LIAM: So he would not be a
follower of your work specifically.

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:22.284
MATT: "No, but I do not speak with him.

01:18:22.284 --> 01:18:25.530
"All of that is brought to his attention

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:29.965
"by Ludinus when he finds it sufficient and necessary.

01:18:29.965 --> 01:18:31.588
"Sometimes to just

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.330
"ensure that

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:41.690
"misunderstanding minds do not make rash judgment calls

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:43.490
"about things they do not understand."

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.910
LIAM: Little bit feels like we're speaking of one person.

01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:49.743
MATT: "Perhaps.

01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:53.023
"Well.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.080
"Unless you have other business with me, I believe I am to

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.406
"make my way to my quarters."

01:19:02.406 --> 01:19:04.281
SAM: You know what?

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:05.430
We'll take care of dinner tonight,

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:09.453
just as a thank you for bringing us along on this journey.

01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:12.690
MATT: "That's surprising.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.130
"This is certainly a first for anyone I've hired

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:21.723
"for a particular journey.

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:25.710
"This is very kind of you."

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:27.490
(laughter)
SAM: It's our pleasure.

01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:28.323
MATT: "Of course."

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:31.503
And she takes one of the bottles of wine.

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:36.493
"I will prepare for the rest of my evening's plans.

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.130
"I believe Dagen is at your disposal.

01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:45.270
"Enjoy the rest of your meal, and once again, thank you."

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:46.323
SAM: You're welcome.

01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:48.836
TALIESIN: Excellent.

01:19:48.836 --> 01:19:51.270
(laughter)

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:52.780
SAM: She didn't offer to pay!

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.920
TRAVIS: Just to be clear--
SAM: Why did you--

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.190
You just put it out there,

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:56.541
she would have paid!
TRAVIS: Did we have to offer--

01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:57.870
SAM: It was her duty to say, "No, no, no,

01:19:57.870 --> 01:20:00.250
"I couldn't possibly accept," she didn't do that.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.417
TRAVIS: But now we--
SAM: She's a scoundrel

01:20:01.417 --> 01:20:02.250
and we should kill her.

01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:05.165
TRAVIS: We have to offer again now, according to your rule!

01:20:05.165 --> 01:20:07.270
SAM: No, we don't have to offer again, that's, I mean--

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:08.624
LAURA: Why would we have to offer again?

01:20:08.624 --> 01:20:11.043
She already accepted!
TRAVIS: If she accepted, we have to--

01:20:11.043 --> 01:20:11.876
TALIESIN: I can cover.

01:20:11.876 --> 01:20:13.060
SAM: I don't care about that!

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.330
I care about her being the type of person

01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:16.490
who wouldn't offer back!

01:20:16.490 --> 01:20:17.920
We offer, she offers back.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:18.970
That's how it works.

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:20.590
TALIESIN: I can completely cover.

01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:23.140
LAURA: In her defense, I mean, she is one person

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:23.973
and we are a lot of people.

01:20:23.973 --> 01:20:25.300
SAM: She's the host!

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.914
She's our employer!

01:20:26.914 --> 01:20:28.848
TRAVIS: Is there any food on her table?

01:20:28.848 --> 01:20:30.370
Is it just drinks?

01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:31.824
MATT: Oh, no, she ate a small meal.

01:20:31.824 --> 01:20:34.617
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.
(laughter)

01:20:34.617 --> 01:20:36.200
What did she have?

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.550
MATT: From what you can tell from the remnants there,

01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:40.540
there were actually, and this is hilarious,

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.598
little bits of what looks like carrot.

01:20:42.598 --> 01:20:44.320
LAURA: (gasping)

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.030
MATT: It looks like the remnants of a pretty decent dish

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:47.090
that was prepared for her.

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.923
TRAVIS: You!

01:20:48.851 --> 01:20:50.320
SAM: Me?!

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.230
TRAVIS: A carrot, do you have any idea how expensive

01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:54.379
that is up here?!
SAM: I'm eating it.

01:20:54.379 --> 01:20:57.220
I buy it, I'm eating it.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.800
TRAVIS: Caduceus can't even need meat
and you ate the carrot!

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.780
LIAM: She is a member of the Assembly,

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.280
she probably has very little idea of cost.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.910
She probably throws out a couple of platinum

01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:08.110
for those carrots, you know, for anything.

01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:09.860
A bottle of water, here's two platinum.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:10.920
Is generally how it rolls.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:11.939
TALIESIN: I cannot wait to see the bill.

01:21:11.939 --> 01:21:13.490
TRAVIS: Do we pay the tab or do we just bounce?

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:16.070
SAM: No, we're going to pay the tab
because we're nice people.

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:17.720
I'm just saying, first she,

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.590
she tortures my husband and now she doesn't cover dinner.

01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:21.600
That's two strikes.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.930
One more, I'm going off on the bitch.

01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:26.720
TRAVIS: Okay.
(laughter)

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.310
TALIESIN: Pretty sure she would have covered dinner

01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:29.250
if you hadn't said anything.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:30.289
SAM: I know!

01:21:30.289 --> 01:21:31.660
(laughter)

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.863
You're missing the point.

01:21:32.863 --> 01:21:34.510
TALIESIN: I really am.

01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:35.343
SAM: Forget it.

01:21:36.501 --> 01:21:38.383
LAURA: I'll go down and talk to Dagen.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:41.900
TRAVIS: Can we flag down someone that knows

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.300
how much this all costs?

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:46.600
SAM: Yeah, there is one of the servers

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.590
that helped set up the table

01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:51.860
who, like a lot of people here, probably runs multiple jobs.

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.000
She looks a bit haggard, in her late 50s,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.450
and currently just has a leather sack over her shoulder

01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:59.720
with some supplies that she's running from the back room

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.290
to bring in and start preparing

01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:02.930
for the next group of soldiers that begin coming in

01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:04.920
from their trek and turns,

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.906
"Yeah, what do you want?"

01:22:05.906 --> 01:22:09.279
TRAVIS: We're here to settle Lady Vess DeRogna's bill.

01:22:09.279 --> 01:22:12.166
Do you have any idea how much that is?

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:12.999
MATT: "I don't know.

01:22:12.999 --> 01:22:15.837
"It's all Assembly prepared, there's no bill."

01:22:15.837 --> 01:22:16.670
LAURA: Oh.

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:19.470
TRAVIS: Oh, you mean she brought it with her,

01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:22.160
or the Assembly just has a tab?

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.910
MATT: "The Assembly pays for Balenpost."

01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:25.990
TRAVIS: Oh good, yes.

01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:28.610
We will be using that account later, thank you.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.183
I just wanted to make sure it was set up here.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.950
MATT: Her eyes squint a bit like, you, "Who are you?"

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:38.450
TRAVIS: Very important person.

01:22:39.734 --> 01:22:40.567
(laughter)

01:22:40.567 --> 01:22:42.264
I say out loud, awkwardly.

01:22:42.264 --> 01:22:43.728
(laughter)

01:22:43.728 --> 01:22:44.878
LIAM: Squirtle!

01:22:44.878 --> 01:22:46.248
(laughter)

01:22:46.248 --> 01:22:48.126
ASHLEY: We don't pay for anything?

01:22:48.126 --> 01:22:49.797
Or just like the food here is--

01:22:49.797 --> 01:22:51.680
LAURA: She was kind of laughing at you.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.736
SAM: So am I the asshole then?

01:22:53.736 --> 01:22:55.531
MARISHA: Yes.
(laughter)

01:22:55.531 --> 01:22:56.364
She definitely made an asshole of you.

01:22:56.364 --> 01:22:57.970
LIAM: Generally speaking.

01:22:57.970 --> 01:23:00.570
TRAVIS: Yeah, we literally have a blank check.

01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:01.403
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:01.403 --> 01:23:03.810
MARISHA: There were Cerberus Assembly banners

01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:05.550
the moment we walked in.

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:07.130
TALIESIN: I assume it's on the company card.

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:08.770
LIAM: It's the Assembly cafeteria.

01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:10.070
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:11.197
SAM: Well, I'm glad I offered.

01:23:11.197 --> 01:23:12.283
TRAVIS: A great gesture.

01:23:12.283 --> 01:23:13.350
SAM: We look better now.

01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:14.750
LAURA: Yeah yeah.
LIAM: By the way,

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:16.726
did you try the Cerberus fries?

01:23:16.726 --> 01:23:18.750
They're delicious.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:23.413
LAURA: We seem like very ill-informed, nice people.

01:23:23.413 --> 01:23:24.246
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:24.246 --> 01:23:25.511
SAM: That's what we're going for.

01:23:25.511 --> 01:23:26.344
LIAM: That's one for two.

01:23:26.344 --> 01:23:27.353
SAM: They'll never suspect.

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.204
All right.

01:23:30.204 --> 01:23:31.037
LAURA: Dagen?

01:23:31.037 --> 01:23:31.870
MARISHA: Dagen.
MATT: All right.

01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:34.380
So you head over to Dagen's table and he's

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.810
he's sitting there with a large, heavy tankard

01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:41.490
at the table and lantern on the edge of his table right now

01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:43.460
is framing his face

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.300
and somewhat greasy beard as you approach

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.780
and he wipes it down a bit.

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.180
Takes a piece out, chews it.

01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:53.600
"Hey, so...

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:57.137
"What can I do for you?"

01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.440
LAURA: So...

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:03.250
What are we going to do, what are we going to see,

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:05.235
what have you fought?

01:24:05.235 --> 01:24:06.784
MATT: "(chuckling)"

01:24:06.784 --> 01:24:09.060
He rubs the side of his mustache

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.560
and some piece of meat large enough

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.290
comes falling out, it goes (boofs) on the table, he's like,

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:17.340
"I've been doing this for quite some time.

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.500
"Never did like too much of the Uthodurnians,

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.390
"so I found a better chance for gold

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.000
"on this side of Eiselcross.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
"And let me tell you, there's some mean shit out there."

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:34.300
TRAVIS: That's exciting. We've heard tale

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.000
that the storm giants are holding up trade routes

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.160
in the waters around here.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.750
Those don't happen to be on the main land, do they?

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:44.150
MATT: "No, no, that's far south

01:24:44.150 --> 01:24:45.810
"and outside of my prerogative here.

01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:48.230
"Here in Eiselcross specifically (hiccups),

01:24:48.230 --> 01:24:53.230
"you find, let's see here, we got a whole shit ton of yeti."

01:24:53.576 --> 01:24:54.409
LAURA: Whoa.

01:24:54.409 --> 01:24:58.700
MATT: "We got ice salamanders, and they're nasty things.

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:00.570
"We got mammoths, heaps of mammoths

01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:03.560
"which tend to draw other things out as well.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.940
"There are troll mutations up the wazoo.

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:08.900
"We got a whole host of nomadic frost giants

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.590
"that wander the outskirts of the plains here,

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:15.050
"not to mention the freaky cursed

01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:18.180
"frost giant castle place far north,

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.088
"but just-- we're not going that far, we'll be good."

01:25:20.088 --> 01:25:22.521
TRAVIS: What-- what-- what castle place?
MARISHA: Frost giant castle?

01:25:22.521 --> 01:25:24.853
TRAVIS: I pull out the map and look.

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:27.790
MATT: "It's further north than that, don't worry about it."

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.560
TRAVIS: North of Aeor and Fort--

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.550
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:32.521
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: "Some Jarl or something."

01:25:32.521 --> 01:25:35.150
TALIESIN: The castle is cursed or
the frost giants are cursed?

01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:36.250
Or is it both of them are cursed?

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:39.285
MATT: "I think he's kind of a shared thing."

01:25:39.285 --> 01:25:41.230
LIAM: But not on the path that you are taking us on.

01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:42.690
MATT: "No, no."
LIAM: Okay.

01:25:42.690 --> 01:25:47.690
MATT: "There's hunter gnolls,
we got polar bears, remorhazes."

01:25:47.888 --> 01:25:49.480
MARISHA: Rem-- remorhazes?

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.660
MATT: "Yeah."
LAURA: What are rammer-- remorhazes?

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:55.087
LIAM: The big bug centipede, we fought one of those once.

01:25:55.087 --> 01:25:59.740
MATT: "Giant insectoid thing, many pinchers, big eyes

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.602
"burrows through the ground."
LAURA: I didn't know the name of it.

01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:05.340
MATT: "Oh, there's also Ol' Demarog."

01:26:06.223 --> 01:26:07.580
SAM and MARISHA: Demorog?

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.415
MATT: "Ol' Demarog."
SAM: Ol' Demarog?

01:26:09.415 --> 01:26:12.893
MARISHA: Wait, do you call-- is his title Ol' Demarog?

01:26:12.893 --> 01:26:14.580
MATT: "It's his name, it's what we call him.

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:19.150
"It's what the local legends say."

01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:21.590
MARISHA: Is a demorog what he is or his title?

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:22.682
MATT: "It's his name."

01:26:22.682 --> 01:26:24.040
MARISHA: What is he then?

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.300
LIAM: Have you crossed paths with him?

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:29.080
MATT: "There are many wolves that hunt the realms here.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.230
"And there are some wolves that have been mutated

01:26:31.230 --> 01:26:34.650
"by the magics of Eiselcross to really embody

"the dangers of the frost they live in.

"And then amongst <i>those</i> wolves,

"Kind of a ghost of a massive feral beast.

"His breath itself is the very life-sucking anger of winter.

01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:08.460
LAURA: (giggles)

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.323
SAM: Is that a true thing or it just--

01:27:10.323 --> 01:27:11.610
MATT: "I've never seen him."
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:14.410
MATT: "But I hear about it all the time."

01:27:14.410 --> 01:27:16.710
LIAM: Of the things that you <i>have</i> seen,

01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:19.177
what is the worst and what is the most common?

01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:25.300
MATT: "Most common around these parts?

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:28.513
"You're probably likely to find some wandering yeti.

"we keep an eye out for them.

"They tend to be ambushers, trappers and such.

"They're a problem.
(sniffs)"

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.019
MARISHA: We've dealt with a lot of regular gnolls.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:55.698
SAM: (laughs)
MATT: "Regular gnolls,

01:27:55.698 --> 01:27:57.620
"regular gnolls, yeah yeah yeah.

"These are a little more,

"these are a little more frosty.

"I mean that both in a comical sense

"and a literal, like--"
MARISHA: Okay.

01:28:06.054 --> 01:28:10.460
MATT: "The harsh environment's
forged a better, greater gnoll."

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.440
TALIESIN: Frosty gnoll.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.782
MATT: "Frosty gnolls, if you will."

01:28:12.782 --> 01:28:15.300
TALIESIN: Frosty gnoll.
MATT: "(hiccups) (sniffs)"

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:16.933
LAURA and MARISHA: Okay.

01:28:16.933 --> 01:28:19.400
SAM: Anything else we need to prepare for tomorrow?

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.183
Or are we good?
MATT: "Can you all fight?"

01:28:21.183 --> 01:28:22.016
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:28:22.016 --> 01:28:23.090
SAM: Yeah.

01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:24.260
MATT: "Good."

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.330
LAURA: When does the magic started getting weird, though?

01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:30.280
Is it only inside the buildings or it's all over the place?

01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:34.900
MATT: "I don't know, I'm not much of a magic person myself.

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.530
"Most thing I have around me is this thing,"

01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:39.150
and he taps the chair a bit and goes,

01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:43.133
"And even that's just for a smaller purposes.

01:28:44.130 --> 01:28:45.450
"I don't know.

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:49.487
"More, better luck talking to your hiring mistress there."

01:28:49.487 --> 01:28:51.340
LAURA: Right, right, right.

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:53.723
MARISHA: That chair looks very impressive, by the way.

01:28:53.723 --> 01:28:55.403
MATT: "Thank you."
MARISHA: Very...

01:28:56.430 --> 01:29:00.270
very trustworthy chair, that one.

01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:01.790
Where'd you get it?
MATT: "It's Uthodurnian make."

01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:03.498
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: "Uthodurnian make."

01:29:03.498 --> 01:29:04.610
MARISHA: Uthodurnian make.
LAURA: Oh yeah!

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:06.363
We've been there.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:06.363 --> 01:29:07.910
MATT: "Oh, have you?

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:09.422
"Pain in the ass, isn't it?"

01:29:09.422 --> 01:29:11.560
LAURA: Yeah, but they have a good bakery.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.960
MATT: "You're not wrong."

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.250
SAM: And that chair of yours can go over rugged terrain

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:18.430
like we'll be doing tomorrow?

01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:20.440
MATT: "It's outfitted for it, don't worry."

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.713
SAM: Nice.
MARISHA: That's awesome.

01:29:21.713 --> 01:29:23.538
MATT: "In fact, I hope you all can keep up."

01:29:24.378 --> 01:29:25.211
SAM: We'll do our best.

01:29:25.211 --> 01:29:27.490
MARISHA: What's your weapon of choice?

01:29:27.490 --> 01:29:28.450
MATT: "Oh."

01:29:28.450 --> 01:29:31.470
He reaches back behind the chair and then (crashing)

01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:33.900
slams onto the table this battleaxe that

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.620
you see this massive, thick, leather-gripped hilt

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.260
this heavy, dark,

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:41.330
acid-scarred metal head to it

01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:43.310
that is now buried about three inches into the table.

01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:45.450
As he holds it there, you can see the forearm bulging

01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:48.603
and his massive, dwarven, war-cut muscles.

01:29:51.218 --> 01:29:52.110
SAM: Cool.

01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:54.552
MARISHA: All right, yeah, that's a sufficient answer.

01:29:54.552 --> 01:29:55.727
TALIESIN: That'll do it.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:55.727 --> 01:29:56.927
LIAM: That's a lot of bicep.

01:29:58.827 --> 01:30:00.520
MATT: "Her name's Sheila."

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.890
MARISHA: Sheila.
TRAVIS: The name is Sheila?

01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:06.040
SAM: The axe?
TRAVIS: All hail Sheila.

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.993
MARISHA: All hail Sheila!
MATT: "Godsdamned right."

01:30:08.993 --> 01:30:11.201
LAURA: Did you know someone named Sheila?

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.500
MATT: "No, just sounded like a fun name for an axe."

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:16.875
LAURA: Insight check.

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:20.190
MATT: Make an insight check.
(laughter)

01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:22.060
LIAM: Yeah, is that an ax or an ex?

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:22.893
LAURA: Nyah.

01:30:23.955 --> 01:30:26.727
(humming)
12.

01:30:26.727 --> 01:30:27.560
MATT: 12.

01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:33.558
You get the sense he's kind of an open book.

01:30:33.558 --> 01:30:36.210
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: And he speaks the truth.

01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:37.670
He just thought it was a cool name for an axe

01:30:37.670 --> 01:30:39.545
and named it Sheila.
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.035
I like this one, I like him a lot.

01:30:44.675 --> 01:30:47.830
SAM: Well, I guess we'll go get some shut eye.

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:49.320
MATT: "Just make sure you've got your weapons ready.

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.760
"It looks like you're mostly ready to dress warm.

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.070
"I'd say bring some extra blankets

01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:55.390
"if you're planning to sleep out in the open.

01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:56.223
"It's real...

"It's <i>real</i> cold at night."

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:00.339
SAM: All right, all right.

01:31:00.339 --> 01:31:02.570
MATT: "Not everyone's got a Sheila to keep them warm."

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.420
MARISHA: Oh.

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.870
Um...

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:11.100
I was going to ask another question, but now I'm thrown.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.210
Wha-- wh--

01:31:14.210 --> 01:31:16.520
First time you went out,

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.010
what's one thing you wish someone would have told you?

01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:22.635
MATT: "Good question, good, good question.

01:31:23.876 --> 01:31:25.226
"(sighs)

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:33.038
"Sometimes

"scavenging

"isn't worth what you find."

01:31:40.192 --> 01:31:41.025
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:31:42.353 --> 01:31:44.610
SAM: A philosophy.

01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:45.443
MARISHA: Okay.

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.363
Many tempting scavenging sites?

01:31:50.482 --> 01:31:54.394
MATT: Well, let's just say a lot
of folk haven't made the journey.

01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:58.200
"And there's some smarter dangers out there

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.010
"that like to use them as a...

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.746
"a beacon for their quarry.

"But to be fair, I haven't checked any of the bodies.

"So there might be something
really worth on 'em still, but."

01:32:14.004 --> 01:32:14.850
(laughter)

01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:17.400
"I'm just, you know, better safe than sorry."

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.350
MARISHA: Right.
MATT: "You understand?"

01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:20.986
MARISHA: That's good advice, thank you.

01:32:20.986 --> 01:32:23.760
MATT: "Right." (sniffs)

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.193
"You, um..."

01:32:25.193 --> 01:32:26.830
SAM: Well, good night.

01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:29.344
MATT: He points to his cup, just like...

01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:32.521
SAM: Oh yeah, we'll buy you another drink.

01:32:32.521 --> 01:32:34.880
MATT: "Oh, it's too kind of you.
SAM: You know what?

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.740
Everything's on us tonight, your whole dinner tonight.

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.430
It's on us.
TRAVIS: Veth!

01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:41.148
SAM: (quietly) Well, I mean, it's free, right?

01:32:41.148 --> 01:32:43.380
(laughter)

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.463
MATT: "Much obliged.

01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:47.860
"I appreciate it, y'all rest well,

LAURA: Okay.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.944

MATT: "(laughs)

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:00.770
"All hail Sheila."

01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:01.967
Puts his fist out.

01:33:01.967 --> 01:33:03.241
(crashing)

01:33:03.241 --> 01:33:05.987
(laughter)

01:33:05.987 --> 01:33:07.800
TRAVIS: His knuckles have--
MATT: "All right, fill 'er up!"

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.110
And he shakes it in the air.

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:11.890
And you hear the faint bit of sloshing backwash

01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:14.133
in the inside of the metallic interior.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.960
What do you want to do?

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.570
SAM: Go to bed.
LAURA: Room three is where it's at.

01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:20.470
SAM: Did you want to scry?

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:21.303
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Okay.

01:33:21.303 --> 01:33:22.560
LIAM: Yeah, but we need to do that before

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.101
going to the party palace.
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to do that

01:33:24.101 --> 01:33:25.900
when we get into the rooms.

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.903
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: The party palace?

01:33:26.903 --> 01:33:29.430
LAURA: I'll scry on Molly.

01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:33.750
MATT: Okay, you guys head to the
inside of your rooms, they are

01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:37.430
on par with

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.060
the roughest rooms you ordered in Rosohna.

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.560
But they're functional and they're warm.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.220
Warmer than the outside.

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:54.260
The whole place seems to be at least fairly well insulated.

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:56.230
Yeah, so you settle in there, you get your supplies together

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.540
You guys gather and you go ahead,
you said you want to scry on Molly?

01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.373
Okay.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.605
Pardon me, Ivan.
TRAVIS: I'm going to scry on Taliesin's face.

01:34:03.605 --> 01:34:05.493
SAM: Scry on Ivan.
LIAM: He's, Ivan's so little.

01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:09.280
MATT: Well look, quarantine's
affected us all in different ways.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.530
TALIESIN: I'm working on spells right now.

01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:12.993
I'm just setting up tomorrow.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.245
SAM: You guys, Ashley's gone.

01:34:16.245 --> 01:34:17.330
(laughter)

01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:19.537
ASHLEY: Guys, can you see me?
(startled yelling)

01:34:19.537 --> 01:34:20.867
You can hear me, you can't see me?

01:34:20.867 --> 01:34:22.675
SAM: Oh, you moved a little and now I can see you.

01:34:22.675 --> 01:34:24.086
ASHLEY: Can you see my arms?

01:34:24.086 --> 01:34:27.640
(laughter)

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.323
MATT: So.
TALIESIN: Disturbing.

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:34.170
MATT: As you set up your ritual in the room

01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:36.620
to go ahead and close your eyes

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.483
and focus on your friend, Molly.

01:34:39.685 --> 01:34:41.710
And you close your eyes and you feel

01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:44.110
the presence of a familiar figure

01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:49.410
appear across the circle from where you're sitting currently

01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:53.190
leans in and places his hand over yours and goes,

01:34:53.190 --> 01:34:58.190
"Well, let's keep tabs on your
mysterious stranger, shall we?"

01:34:58.456 --> 01:35:00.280
LAURA: (giggles)

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:03.050
MATT: As you close your eyes, you feel like--

01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:04.160
even though his hands are touching yours,

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:07.372
you feel this extension of his magic

01:35:07.372 --> 01:35:09.130
pluck your consciousness from you

01:35:09.130 --> 01:35:12.400
and alley-oop it upwards into darkness.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.400
And you feel yourself suddenly floating.

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:22.220
You find yourself inside a warmly lit chamber.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.150
You see a figure moving in a familiar fur lined coat,

01:35:30.150 --> 01:35:33.370
the same that you saw Mollymauk wearing,

01:35:33.370 --> 01:35:34.930
or at least the figure that you saw

01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:36.640
in your previous scry

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.130
is currently pulling through different

01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:42.410
boxes and satchels

01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:44.820
and is carefully but quickly looting

01:35:45.670 --> 01:35:46.910
the contents of this room

01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:50.870
before turning around and you see the tattoo,

01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:53.810
the familiar peacock tattoo on the neck.

01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:57.180
You see this flash in the red eye

01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:58.600
that's nestled within the tattoo

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:02.263
begins to emit a dull red light.

01:36:03.670 --> 01:36:07.690
As it does, you watch as the purple tiefling's eyes

01:36:07.690 --> 01:36:10.733
meet the beacon that you're seeing through and goes,

01:36:11.730 --> 01:36:13.315
"Oh, well lookie here.

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:16.560
"A return visitor.

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.533
"Now, don't get running, you've curiosity to sate, right?

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.458
"I take it you're the one who's been peeking recently.

01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:29.500
"I have to thank you, for without your scent,

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:32.363
"I wouldn't have been able to follow <i>her</i>."

01:36:34.975 --> 01:36:36.723
He keeps looking through things.

01:36:36.723 --> 01:36:38.240
"Now, don't be alarmed.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.893
"I see many things with mine eyes.

01:36:42.153 --> 01:36:44.610
"Been trying to watch this one's path

01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:46.160
"a while now until you found me.

01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:50.651
"Saw the threads and we made a detour.

01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:54.820
"Shame really, all that knowledge

01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:58.210
"and so little understanding.

01:36:58.210 --> 01:36:59.490
"Ah!"

01:36:59.490 --> 01:37:02.210
And you see from off-- off the--

01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:05.550
the actual scry beacon's location,

01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:06.890
he darts off and returns

01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:09.270
with a collection of papers,

01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:11.140
like a binderless book,

01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:14.533
just all stitched together with no front and back,

01:37:14.533 --> 01:37:17.640
just this heavy collection of old parchment

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.743
looking worn and withered with age.

01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:22.390
He passes through a bit.

01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:25.100
You see his eyes going wide with a smile on his face

01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:26.483
and he turns back to you.

01:37:28.803 --> 01:37:30.653
"But you see now things are set right.

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:34.460
"Once more, I have what she took from me."

01:37:36.999 --> 01:37:40.200
And you see him dart just beyond the range of it.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.930
And it follows his direction

01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:46.310
as he comes to an open window with a frozen snowfall outside

01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:48.503
and he steps through it and looks back at you,

01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:52.548
framed in this lightless, dark night sky.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.960
"To alpha and alpha.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.893
"We trek 'til homeward bound we be.

01:38:00.893 --> 01:38:02.126
"(chuckles)

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:05.078
"Maybe we'll see you there."

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.308
And he ducks out the window and then does this.

01:38:09.308 --> 01:38:10.230
(snaps)

01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:12.783
And as he does that, your scry ends.

01:38:16.707 --> 01:38:18.993
SAM: What?!
LAURA: What the fuck was that?

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:21.160
Artie, what was that?

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.360
MATT: "That was very strange indeed."

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.920
LAURA: Have you ever seen anyone do anything like that?

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.660
MATT: "I mean, there are ways individuals

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:30.300
"can look through such scrying spells.

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.299
"It's not a perfect art, necessarily."

01:38:33.299 --> 01:38:37.062
LAURA: He said there's a benefit to having nine eyes.

01:38:37.062 --> 01:38:38.717
MATT: "Well, I imagine you probably can see more

01:38:38.717 --> 01:38:39.833
"around you with nine eyes, yes."

01:38:39.833 --> 01:38:42.700
LAURA: We're talking about the Nine Eyes, Nona--

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.312
The Eyes of Nine!

01:38:44.312 --> 01:38:45.390
You think they're connected?
MATT: "I wasn't there,

01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:48.140
"I was just helping you do it. I didn't see what you saw."

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:49.680
LAURA: You didn't see it?

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.590
MATT: "No, I was helping you do it."

01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:55.090
LAURA: Oh my god, I thought you
were looking at everything, too!

01:38:55.090 --> 01:38:56.873
This whole time, every time we scry,

01:38:56.873 --> 01:38:58.100
you don't actually scry?

01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.603
You just let me scry?

01:38:59.603 --> 01:39:01.170
MATT: "Yes!"

01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:03.270
LAURA: Oh, that's really nice of you.

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.340
MATT: "I trust in your power.

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:05.830
"You've proven it time and time again."

01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:06.663
LAURA: Wow.

01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:09.130
You guys!

01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:10.340
I tell them everything I saw.

01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:13.330
SAM: What does that mean, "to alpha and alpha"?

01:39:13.330 --> 01:39:15.180
Is that what you said?
LAURA: Homeward, home--

01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:18.113
TRAVIS: "Homeward bound we be."
ASHLEY: "Until homeward bound we be."

01:39:18.113 --> 01:39:20.215
LIAM: And he saw you right away.

01:39:20.215 --> 01:39:21.480
LAURA: He saw me right away.

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.969
TRAVIS: Whose scent? Her scent? Vess?

01:39:23.969 --> 01:39:24.900
LAURA: Who knows?

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:25.733
LIAM: Maybe.

01:39:25.733 --> 01:39:26.570
SAM: Cree?

01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:27.536
Or someone else?

01:39:27.536 --> 01:39:30.942
Something about she stole something from me

01:39:30.942 --> 01:39:32.519
and now I have it back, is that what he said?

01:39:32.519 --> 01:39:33.981
MARISHA: The book.
LAURA: I bet that's Vess.

01:39:33.981 --> 01:39:36.224
MARISHA: The book, I bet Vess stole some sort of

01:39:36.224 --> 01:39:39.210
ritual papers or book or--

01:39:39.210 --> 01:39:40.043
LIAM: She worked with them.
MARISHA: -- and then got it back.

01:39:40.043 --> 01:39:41.968
LAURA: Molly's like an old, old, old soul.
LIAM: She stole from them.

01:39:41.968 --> 01:39:43.301
SAM: That's the book!

01:39:43.301 --> 01:39:45.030
LAURA: I bet he's been around for forever.

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:47.040
I bet he's as old as the Bright Queen!

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.630
MARISHA: Maybe the book was a copy

01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:51.170
and maybe he went back for the original parchment.

01:39:51.170 --> 01:39:52.128
SAM: Wait, so--

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:57.150
There's a book that he has now that Vess took from him?

01:39:57.150 --> 01:40:00.155
MARISHA: Yeah, remember when we were talking to Cree

01:40:00.155 --> 01:40:03.970
and she was like, "Oh, we had that book

01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:07.603
"and we had that woman and that
woman stole the book from us."

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:09.900
SAM: But now he's got it back.

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.350
How did he get it back?

01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:14.300
MARISHA: What she just said.
LAURA: He didn't tell me!

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:17.910
MARISHA: Vess was just talking
about coming back here to get--

01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:22.476
to get rubbings of original spells

01:40:22.476 --> 01:40:23.551
and original things.

01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:25.960
Maybe he came back to the source.

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.580
TRAVIS: He was in a warm place, right?

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:28.542
Not outside.

01:40:28.542 --> 01:40:29.973
No sense of cold.
LAURA: He was in a chamber.

01:40:29.973 --> 01:40:31.101
LIAM: Yeah.

01:40:31.101 --> 01:40:32.853
And you said he was on a detour?

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.633
<i>Ja</i>, he mentioned that?

01:40:34.633 --> 01:40:36.120
MARISHA: What does that mean?

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.550
LAURA: What does it mean that he

01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:41.176
my scrying scent--
MARISHA: He followed her scent?

01:40:41.176 --> 01:40:43.142
LAURA: My scrying allowed him to--
TRAVIS: Thought we were chasing him.

01:40:43.142 --> 01:40:45.240
LIAM: Well, his sight is true, yeah?

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.213
He has those eyes all over his body.

01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:51.255
He could see you, he could see the way you sometimes can.

01:40:51.255 --> 01:40:53.950
LAURA: He couldn't see who I was, no, but he saw--

01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:55.230
LIAM: But he knew someone was there.

01:40:55.230 --> 01:40:58.330
SAM: And he said that the act of you scrying on him

01:40:58.330 --> 01:40:59.900
helped him get his stuff back

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:01.277
or helped him on his current path?

01:41:01.277 --> 01:41:03.177
LAURA: That's what it sounded like he said.

01:41:04.253 --> 01:41:05.086
I couldn't tell,

01:41:05.086 --> 01:41:07.479
his accent was way stronger than it used to be.

01:41:07.479 --> 01:41:08.370
TRAVIS: (snorts)
SAM: Oh, really?

01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:10.210
Was it pretty legit?

01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:11.763
Was it pretty legit, though?

01:41:11.763 --> 01:41:14.359
TRAVIS: Oh, let's get some Solarcaine for that burn!

01:41:14.359 --> 01:41:16.609
(laughter)

01:41:17.628 --> 01:41:19.878
LIAM: Is it even the same guy?

01:41:19.878 --> 01:41:20.902
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

01:41:20.902 --> 01:41:22.635
SAM: It must've been a different guy

01:41:22.635 --> 01:41:23.735
because of the consistency.

01:41:23.735 --> 01:41:24.649
LIAM: Yeah.

01:41:24.649 --> 01:41:27.450
(laughter)

01:41:27.450 --> 01:41:31.263
MARISHA: What if it was when we scryed on Cree?

01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:34.183
LAURA: Maybe?

01:41:34.183 --> 01:41:35.830
MARISHA: Connective tissue.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:37.710
LIAM: Maybe, but motherfucker has Truesight.

01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:39.040
He's going to be hard to sneak up on.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.940
LAURA: I don't want to scry on him anymore.

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.390
We should have just messaged him.

01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:45.290
I should have just sent him a message.

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.393
SAM: You still can.

01:41:49.446 --> 01:41:50.760
I don't know what you would say.

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:53.557
LAURA: What the fuck does "to alpha, to alpha

01:41:53.557 --> 01:41:55.367
"and homeward bound we be" mean?

01:41:55.367 --> 01:41:56.767
TRAVIS: Well, we should ask Vess

01:41:56.767 --> 01:41:58.283
and see what her reaction is.

01:41:58.283 --> 01:42:00.025
LAURA: Oh yeah, we should just say it to her.

01:42:00.025 --> 01:42:01.590
MARISHA: What if she's the alpha?

01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:03.970
SAM: She's not going to tell us shit, we can't trust her.

01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:05.923
TRAVIS: "To alpha and alpha"?

01:42:06.758 --> 01:42:07.591
Is that what it was?

01:42:07.591 --> 01:42:08.424
MATT: That's what it was.

01:42:08.424 --> 01:42:09.257
MARISHA: To, from? Was it--

01:42:09.257 --> 01:42:13.233
"To alpha and alpha," yeah.

01:42:13.233 --> 01:42:15.638
MATT: "We trek 'til homeward bound we be."

01:42:15.638 --> 01:42:19.688
MARISHA: "We trek 'til homeward bound we be."

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.420
SAM: We're all writing this down

01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.960
like it's going to mean something.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.370
TRAVIS: It is!

01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:28.590
It always does!

01:42:28.590 --> 01:42:29.680
MARISHA: Bound--

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.083
LIAM: To market, to market.
MARISHA: -- we be.

01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:36.190
So he believes that wherever he's going,

01:42:36.190 --> 01:42:40.810
wherever this is, that that's some sort of homecoming?

01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:42.500
TALIESIN: It's the beginning.

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:43.370
MARISHA: What do you mean?

01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:45.940
TALIESIN: To alpha and alpha, homeward bound.

01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:47.450
You're going back.

01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:48.283
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:42:48.283 --> 01:42:51.016
TALIESIN: Maybe to the city?

01:42:51.016 --> 01:42:53.610
LIAM: At the very least, he seems further along

01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:57.443
in digging up secrets here than Lady DeRogna.

01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:01.430
TRAVIS: It is unnerving that we were following him

01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:04.770
and he seems to now be somehow following us

01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:07.393
or we've revealed something.

01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:09.363
LAURA: Oops.

01:43:10.530 --> 01:43:12.980
TRAVIS: What scent? What scent?

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:14.760
LAURA: I don't know.

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.420
I've never had anyone talk to me through a scry before.

01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:18.290
MARISHA: Did we ever

01:43:19.170 --> 01:43:22.080
scry on him near Vess?

01:43:23.739 --> 01:43:24.637
Is it something like that, did we ever--

01:43:24.637 --> 01:43:26.283
TRAVIS: I cast See Invisibility.

01:43:27.450 --> 01:43:28.283
MATT: Okay.

01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:31.440
TRAVIS: Looking all around the room.

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.273
Anything.

01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:35.090
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:43:37.130 --> 01:43:39.040
TRAVIS: Nipple tassels!

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:39.873
Nice.

01:43:42.617 --> 01:43:43.450
19.

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:45.599
MATT: 19. At the moment, no, you don't see anything.

01:43:45.599 --> 01:43:47.530
Nothing out of the ordinary.

01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:50.088
TRAVIS: (impacts) I kick the door open, hallway.

01:43:50.088 --> 01:43:52.563
MATT: You look left to right, nobody in the hallway.

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.320
TRAVIS: Any windows?

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.780
MATT: No, the heat would escape otherwise.

01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:58.613
TRAVIS: It's clear.

01:43:58.613 --> 01:43:59.700
MATT: Yeah, all the windows would be

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.160
higher up in the fort from what you saw.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.490
TRAVIS: That's true.

01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:06.020
LIAM: Caleb jams Calianna's wand into the earthy floor

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:09.263
of this room and begins to do the casting for the tower.

01:44:10.230 --> 01:44:12.530
MARISHA: While he's doing that, is there anything I can do?

01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:13.880
Is there anything that,

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:19.073
from Jester's story that jogs anything in my memory?

01:44:20.190 --> 01:44:22.490
From notes, from the past?

01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:24.306
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

01:44:24.306 --> 01:44:25.806
TRAVIS: Roll above a 19.

01:44:27.241 --> 01:44:28.772
MARISHA: All right, don't fuck this up.

01:44:28.772 --> 01:44:30.146
TRAVIS: Getting into some next level shit here.

01:44:30.146 --> 01:44:31.582
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up.

01:44:31.582 --> 01:44:33.140
Don't fuck-- okay, all right, all right, all right.

01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.441
SAM: You need to inspire yourself with some bagpipe.

01:44:36.933 --> 01:44:39.320
You get a plus six to every roll.

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.533
LIAM: Negative three.
MARISHA: 26.

01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:44.880
TRAVIS: Somebody else?

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.203
MARISHA: Yes, 26.

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:52.130
MATT: You're hard pressed to be too far from the trail

01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:55.573
in regards to some of the pieces you're putting together.

01:44:56.750 --> 01:45:01.750
The book that was referred to in Lucien's past

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.660
and the book that Jester seems to have seen him recover,

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.910
it would seem to be--

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.190
Couldn't just be a coincidence.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.483
"To alpha and alpha we trek 'til homeward bound we be."

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.810
It could be one long sentence

01:45:19.810 --> 01:45:23.147
or the cadence in which it was spoken, it could be

01:45:23.147 --> 01:45:25.010
"to alpha and alpha we trek,

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.607
"'til homeward bound we be."

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.123
But there's probably something to that phrase.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.010
Like he wants to be followed.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.088
MARISHA: Like he wants to be followed.

01:45:47.515 --> 01:45:49.182
LAURA: What does it mean?

01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:53.393
"Alpha and alpha we trek."

01:45:54.243 --> 01:45:57.073
TRAVIS: Who gave this map to us again?

01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:59.603
MATT: That was given to you by Vess.

01:46:00.997 --> 01:46:04.220
TRAVIS: There are lots of As with numbers on this map.

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.550
SAM: Really?

01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:07.742
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's an A2, A5.

01:46:08.710 --> 01:46:11.170
An A?, an A4, and then--

01:46:11.170 --> 01:46:12.503
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

01:46:12.503 --> 01:46:14.233
TRAVIS: Aeor is the big red dot.

01:46:15.605 --> 01:46:17.560
SAM: Aeor is spelled...

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.040
TRAVIS: A-E-O-R.

01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:23.180
MATT: You do know that other locations on it

01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:28.180
that are marked with A are considered smaller excavations

01:46:28.230 --> 01:46:30.680
where other, smaller chunks of Aeor

01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:34.680
scattered and fell like meteors

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.390
as the main city crashed into Eiselcross.

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:39.770
SAM: The one that's marked A2,

01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:43.030
is that close to Aeor Prime?

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:45.621
TRAVIS: It is slightly further north than Aeor,

01:46:45.621 --> 01:46:47.090
but further west.

01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:49.860
LIAM: So maybe his detour is along those lines.

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.135
SAM: Alpha and alpha.
MARISHA: Yeah,

01:46:51.135 --> 01:46:51.968
SAM: A2.

01:46:52.805 --> 01:46:56.410
TRAVIS: We could pass A5 on the way to a river--

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:58.095
lava river crossing.

01:46:58.095 --> 01:47:01.719
MARISHA: But once again that might not

01:47:01.719 --> 01:47:03.927
necessarily be connected.

01:47:03.927 --> 01:47:05.650
Caduceus had an interesting point.

01:47:05.650 --> 01:47:08.463
Maybe it's from a city to city.

01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:13.110
Or it could be from a past to a present-type of thing.

01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:14.053
I don't know.

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.173
"To alpha and alpha we trek."

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.770
All right.

01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:24.703
SAM: I feel like at least visiting A2 might be worth a shot.

01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:28.850
TRAVIS: It's further away, but yeah.

01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:31.670
SAM: We'll just teleport there.
LAURA: I wonder if

01:47:31.670 --> 01:47:35.023
Lady de Rogna would know anything about the terms.

01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.940
SAM: She's not going to tell us shit.

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:40.920
LAURA: She might know something about-- she's told us a lot.

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.753
SAM: Yeah.

01:47:43.048 --> 01:47:44.081
LAURA: I mean--

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.696
LIAM: What is home?

01:47:47.696 --> 01:47:50.197
Is home his home?

01:47:50.197 --> 01:47:51.423
Is Aeor his home?

01:47:54.498 --> 01:47:56.320
TALIESIN: It's the flying city.

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.153
LIAM: Yeah.

01:47:59.264 --> 01:48:00.213
LAURA: Oh man.

01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:05.253
How is he connected to-- oh man.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:10.850
TRAVIS: Sleep?

01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:11.910
SAM: Yep.

01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:13.010
MARISHA: Okay.

01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:16.760
LIAM: The door shimmers up from the ground

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:19.240
and you all see stained glass peeping out.

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.830
And I summon Frumpkin

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:23.560
as a cat and say:

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.970
You are the best boy, you are the house cat.

01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:28.453
You are the head cat, go and run things.

01:48:28.453 --> 01:48:30.810
And I give him a little pat on the tush and he runs in.

01:48:30.810 --> 01:48:34.440
And everybody sees him float, spiral up into the tower.

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.357
SAM: (yowling)

01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:40.660
MATT: All right.

01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:42.540
Your evening's tower is prepared.

01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:45.153
SAM: Ah, so warm.

01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:48.003
LIAM: 78 degrees.

01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:53.070
MATT: So your chambers are at the ready.

01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:54.120
If there's anything you want to accomplish

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.810
before a night's sleep, now's the time to pipe up

01:48:55.810 --> 01:48:58.100
or we will go ahead and move on to the next morning.

01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:59.220
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:04.220
LIAM: No, I knock on Veth's door through the study.

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.490
MATT: Nice try, Travis.

01:49:06.490 --> 01:49:08.827
LIAM: Yeah, we're going to cook.

01:49:08.827 --> 01:49:09.852
(laughter)

01:49:09.852 --> 01:49:13.150
SAM: Oh, hello, Caleb, welcome to my room.

01:49:13.150 --> 01:49:14.003
LIAM: Hello, buddy.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:19.673
You know, before we hit the sack,

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.160
the thing that you've done for so long,

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.053
that was so charming for so long--

01:49:27.550 --> 01:49:31.163
I've never really been a leader in any sense.

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:33.683
When this group got together,

01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:36.600
I let them think they were the leader

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.040
and I did whatever the fuck I wanted to do.

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.463
SAM: Good leadership decision right there.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.741
LIAM: Now, much like you implored from me

01:49:46.741 --> 01:49:49.174
back in the Empire,

01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:53.320
these are all our friends, mine, yours.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.840
We trust them implicitly.

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.280
SAM: We do.

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.113
Finally.

01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:04.420
LIAM: It's more of an ensemble, you know?

01:50:05.630 --> 01:50:08.950
I am not a leader, I have never been a leader.

01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:12.623
SAM: Well, you know, there's different ways to lead.

01:50:14.970 --> 01:50:18.380
Some people, you know, lead with an iron fist,

01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:19.790
like King Dwendal,

01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:22.831
or through fear and mystery,

01:50:22.831 --> 01:50:25.247
like the Bright Queen.

01:50:26.210 --> 01:50:29.103
Fjord is very commanding or tries to be

01:50:29.103 --> 01:50:31.472
with his puny frame,

01:50:31.472 --> 01:50:33.500
on the deck of his ship.

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:37.010
And you lead through sort of soft power, you know?

01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:39.250
Look, we're on this journey because of you.

01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:40.730
We came north because of you.

01:50:40.730 --> 01:50:42.550
We came to Rexxentrum because of you.

01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:45.910
And I don't say it like it's a bad thing,

01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:50.570
like you're conniving or taking us on your journey.

01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:52.620
I feel like you are leading this team

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.030
because as we journey,

01:50:59.030 --> 01:51:02.160
you open your heart more and more.

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:05.810
And in doing so, we're brought along for the ride.

01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:08.960
You're sort of showing us the way,

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:13.070
showing us how you have become more open

01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:17.330
to new points of view and experiences

01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:19.950
and even looking into your own past and

01:51:21.162 --> 01:51:24.870
and confronting old demons, even across the dinner table.

01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:27.730
And that's very-- that takes a lot of bravery and courage,

01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:31.100
and hopefully, it's inspired some of these other folks

01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.310
to do it too.

01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:33.901
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but listen to me.

01:51:35.883 --> 01:51:37.013
In the beginning,

01:51:37.013 --> 01:51:38.613
when we were traveling together,

01:51:40.433 --> 01:51:45.193
I was from side to side, top to bottom, a mess

01:51:45.193 --> 01:51:48.983
and I think you were trying to give me a bit of confidence

01:51:48.983 --> 01:51:50.741
and help me get back on my feet.

01:51:52.633 --> 01:51:54.031
I have confidence.

01:51:55.193 --> 01:51:56.783
I am back on my feet.

01:51:58.543 --> 01:52:02.683
And I have surrounded myself with experts in their fields,

01:52:02.683 --> 01:52:04.343
very accomplished people.

01:52:06.103 --> 01:52:11.091
And I am confident to rely on them and not lead.

01:52:12.313 --> 01:52:14.283
I don't want to be a leader,

01:52:14.283 --> 01:52:15.733
I never have,

01:52:15.733 --> 01:52:17.863
but helping, I like,

01:52:17.863 --> 01:52:20.186
and confidence, I enjoy.

01:52:21.873 --> 01:52:23.056
So...

01:52:24.464 --> 01:52:27.605
you have done me a great kindness

01:52:27.605 --> 01:52:31.008
and bolstered my resolve.

01:52:32.553 --> 01:52:34.758
You've helped bring me back into my own

01:52:35.723 --> 01:52:37.183
and now I'm here.

01:52:38.173 --> 01:52:39.006
So

01:52:41.633 --> 01:52:43.023
let's just be here.

01:52:44.893 --> 01:52:46.243
And <i>be</i> here.

01:52:48.455 --> 01:52:51.503
I made this place for you so that you could stay with us,

01:52:51.503 --> 01:52:56.083
and see your husband and child,

01:52:56.083 --> 01:52:59.763
but also be with me and be with them.

01:52:59.763 --> 01:53:00.596
It's a circle.

01:53:00.596 --> 01:53:03.591
There's nine of us and nothing is going to break that.

01:53:07.383 --> 01:53:08.353
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: Go with it, go with it.

01:53:08.353 --> 01:53:09.313
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

01:53:09.313 --> 01:53:10.482
LIAM: I'm the leader.

01:53:10.482 --> 01:53:11.768
SAM: (chuckles)

01:53:12.793 --> 01:53:13.918
I'm all about it,

01:53:13.918 --> 01:53:16.553
and if we can really truly be together

01:53:16.553 --> 01:53:21.553
and I can bring my family along for the ride sometime.

01:53:23.283 --> 01:53:24.533
I mean, that's the dream.

01:53:25.373 --> 01:53:28.399
I hope we can sustain it.

01:53:30.163 --> 01:53:32.450
That's all I've wanted for a while now,

01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:34.596
and it sounds like you do, too.

01:53:36.703 --> 01:53:40.353
So yeah, we'll live in the now

01:53:40.353 --> 01:53:43.583
and we'll just-- we'll be the Nein.

01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:45.453
No leader, it's a round table.

01:53:45.453 --> 01:53:49.463
LIAM: Yep, nine sides, all equal,

01:53:49.463 --> 01:53:50.526
all nine of us.

01:53:52.393 --> 01:53:55.966
SAM: I'm glad that you've led me to that conclusion.

01:53:58.103 --> 01:53:59.153
LIAM: This is a work in progress,

01:53:59.153 --> 01:54:01.593
our family is a work in progress

01:54:01.593 --> 01:54:05.306
but I have faith and I'm not even one of the clerics.

01:54:08.033 --> 01:54:09.433
All right, that's it, sorry.

01:54:10.453 --> 01:54:13.253
SAM: Well, in the morning.

01:54:13.253 --> 01:54:14.333
See you soon.

01:54:16.361 --> 01:54:17.194
Can you call Frumpkin

01:54:17.194 --> 01:54:19.920
to get me some hot cocoa for bed?

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.052
LIAM: Frumpkin? It is too pedestrian for Frumpkin.

01:54:22.052 --> 01:54:24.052
SAM: Well, I don't know the pecking order

01:54:24.052 --> 01:54:26.373
of your pussies around here.

01:54:26.373 --> 01:54:28.613
I mean, some-- we send the cat,

01:54:28.613 --> 01:54:29.713
I don't know.

01:54:29.713 --> 01:54:32.388
What do I do? Do I clap? Do I meow?

01:54:32.388 --> 01:54:35.228
LIAM: Well, you pull the ribbon over by your fireplace.

01:54:35.228 --> 01:54:38.037
SAM: Oh, that's what that's for.
LIAM: Mm-hm.

01:54:40.031 --> 01:54:41.493
SAM: Dinky dink.

01:54:41.493 --> 01:54:43.563
MATT: You watch as a small--

01:54:43.563 --> 01:54:48.113
a series of smaller, semi spectral-looking arcane cats,

01:54:48.113 --> 01:54:50.713
arrive and begin to wrap around your legs,

01:54:50.713 --> 01:54:54.369
in a figure eight motion going-- (meows)

01:54:54.369 --> 01:54:56.083
Then they look up at you expectantly.

01:54:56.083 --> 01:54:58.765
LIAM: Ah, Pepper, you're just the one for this job.

01:54:58.765 --> 01:54:59.982
What would you--
MATT: (meows)

01:54:59.982 --> 01:55:01.633
SAM: Hot cocoa with marshmallows.

01:55:01.633 --> 01:55:06.423
LIAM: Pepper, could you get two hot cocoas with marshmallows

01:55:06.423 --> 01:55:08.776
and then grab those little--

01:55:09.893 --> 01:55:11.033
put a little toothpick

01:55:11.033 --> 01:55:14.113
into one of the marshmallows like a little bow

01:55:14.113 --> 01:55:15.303
and then those graham crackers,

01:55:15.303 --> 01:55:17.650
you can make little wings in the other one.

01:55:17.650 --> 01:55:19.963
MATT: (mrrps)

01:55:19.963 --> 01:55:21.693
MATT: And with that-
LIAM: I saw Jester drawing.

01:55:21.693 --> 01:55:23.078
SAM: Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: Art.

01:55:23.078 --> 01:55:23.911
MATT: (whooshes)

01:55:23.911 --> 01:55:26.835
They all vanish through one of the
small holes in the side of the wall.

01:55:26.835 --> 01:55:28.895
TRAVIS: I love that sound.

01:55:28.895 --> 01:55:30.265
(whooshes)

01:55:30.265 --> 01:55:32.223
LIAM: (sighs)
TALIESIN: There better be a cat named Salt.

01:55:32.223 --> 01:55:34.464
SAM: To the Mighty Nein.

01:55:34.464 --> 01:55:36.264
LIAM: To the Mighty Nein.

01:55:37.403 --> 01:55:40.163
MATT: Within a short time, the cocoa is presented,

01:55:40.163 --> 01:55:44.203
delicious and once again marveling at just

01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:47.889
how good these cats are at making cocoa.

01:55:47.889 --> 01:55:51.142
But it is warm, it is comforting and it is delightful.

01:55:51.142 --> 01:55:55.749
LAURA: What was the name of the books that are in our room?

01:55:56.693 --> 01:55:59.613
LIAM: Well, there is, hold on,

01:55:59.613 --> 01:56:02.300
I don't have it memorized top to bottom.

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:04.193
TRAVIS: How dare you?
LAURA: I know.

01:56:04.193 --> 01:56:06.033
LIAM: One of them was "Tusk Love."

01:56:06.033 --> 01:56:07.583
LAURA: Yes, yes, I've read that one.

01:56:09.593 --> 01:56:11.426
MARISHA: Few times.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:56:11.426 --> 01:56:13.271
Dramatic reading.
MATT: Yeah, paperback and Kindle.

01:56:13.271 --> 01:56:15.521
(laughter)

01:56:16.874 --> 01:56:19.024
LIAM: Oh shit, I have to get to the first room.

01:56:21.190 --> 01:56:25.506
Tusk Love, The Courting of the Crick, <i>Der Katzenprinz</i>,

01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:30.166
Change and the Potentials of Transmutability,

01:56:31.003 --> 01:56:36.003
and <i>Die Waldhexe und andere Zemnische Volksmärchen</i>.

01:56:36.383 --> 01:56:39.382
And I will copy-paste that to you in a magical message.

01:56:39.382 --> 01:56:41.103
LAURA: (laughs)

01:56:41.103 --> 01:56:45.404
LAURA: Are any of those readable?

01:56:45.404 --> 01:56:47.533
(laughter)

01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:48.366
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:56:48.366 --> 01:56:51.823
LIAM: Well, two of them are written in Common.

01:56:51.823 --> 01:56:54.873
Two of them are written in Zemnian and one is in--

01:56:54.873 --> 01:56:59.706
also in Common, but a very dense jargon.

01:57:01.190 --> 01:57:02.356
Arcane jargon.

01:57:02.356 --> 01:57:05.693
LAURA: Why would he put these books
in here if we can't even read them?

01:57:05.693 --> 01:57:07.150
I say to myself.

01:57:07.150 --> 01:57:08.803
(laughter)

01:57:08.803 --> 01:57:11.063
MATT: There is no one there to respond.

01:57:11.063 --> 01:57:13.703
LAURA: Do any of them have pretty covers?

01:57:13.703 --> 01:57:16.058
MATT: Yeah, I mean, overall,

01:57:16.058 --> 01:57:19.273
you know, the ones that you can't read are well-presented,

01:57:19.273 --> 01:57:21.637
which makes it even more frustrating.

01:57:21.637 --> 01:57:22.873
LIAM: And <i>Der Katzenprinz</i>,

01:57:22.873 --> 01:57:25.923
there's a beautiful goldleaf illustration

01:57:25.923 --> 01:57:28.283
of a cat holding a little top hat out like this,

01:57:28.283 --> 01:57:30.523
standing on two feet.

01:57:30.523 --> 01:57:31.614
LAURA: That's so cute.

01:57:32.933 --> 01:57:34.173
I want to read it.

01:57:36.102 --> 01:57:40.273
(laughter)

01:57:40.273 --> 01:57:41.764
MATT: We pull back slowly.

01:57:41.764 --> 01:57:43.443
(laughter)

01:57:43.443 --> 01:57:45.133
TRAVIS: Can't you pull the ribbon?

01:57:45.133 --> 01:57:47.223
LAURA: How will the cats be able to read it for me?

01:57:47.223 --> 01:57:49.493
TALIESIN: They make cocoa, you never know.

01:57:49.493 --> 01:57:52.263
LAURA: I go order some cocoa, and sit down and stare

01:57:52.263 --> 01:57:53.803
at the book.
MATT: Okay.

01:57:53.803 --> 01:57:54.968
TALIESIN: I feel like they could read a book to you

01:57:54.968 --> 01:57:56.243
if they can make cocoa.
TRAVIS: I think so, too.

01:57:56.243 --> 01:57:57.423
MATT: The cocoa is delicious,

01:57:57.423 --> 01:57:59.603
if a bit marred by the frustration as you stare

01:57:59.603 --> 01:58:02.093
at this really pretty book about a cat with a hat

01:58:02.093 --> 01:58:04.403
that you can't read.

01:58:04.403 --> 01:58:06.376
LAURA: Frustrating.
MATT: But nevertheless.

01:58:06.376 --> 01:58:09.473
TALIESIN: Make an insight check.
MARISHA: Aww.

01:58:09.473 --> 01:58:11.083
MATT: You all get a good night's rest.

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:13.383
Spells prepared, long rest is completed,

01:58:13.383 --> 01:58:16.543
healed, and the morning is yours.

01:58:16.543 --> 01:58:20.933
MARISHA: I was in bad shape all day,

01:58:20.933 --> 01:58:23.041
just bloody and beaten while we were talking

01:58:23.041 --> 01:58:24.383
to people.
TRAVIS: Oh shit, sorry.

01:58:24.383 --> 01:58:25.633
ASHLEY: That's right!
MARISHA: Having--

01:58:25.633 --> 01:58:27.001
TRAVIS: Nobody cares about you.

01:58:27.001 --> 01:58:28.018
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:58:28.018 --> 01:58:31.243
MATT: It's been a few days
since you had that fight though.

01:58:31.243 --> 01:58:32.713
MARISHA: Has it?
TRAVIS: Has it?

01:58:32.713 --> 01:58:34.843
MATT: Yeah, you've traveled quite a bit since then, so.

01:58:34.843 --> 01:58:36.283
LIAM: You still got a black eye, though.

01:58:36.283 --> 01:58:39.043
MATT: Yeah, it's still a bit bruised.

01:58:39.043 --> 01:58:39.960
TALIESIN: Visibly not healed.

01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.633
(laughter)

01:58:41.633 --> 01:58:44.303
MATT: Caduceus has refused to heal you this entire time.

01:58:44.303 --> 01:58:46.477
TALIESIN: And Jester can't, so--
MATT: Makes you stronger.

01:58:51.418 --> 01:58:54.426
So you all gather at the base of
the tower and the day is yours.

01:58:56.862 --> 01:58:57.695
MARISHA: Now what?
LAURA: Caleb, what--

01:58:57.695 --> 01:58:58.721
what is the point of this?

01:58:58.721 --> 01:59:00.203
LIAM: What? That is a children's story.

01:59:00.203 --> 01:59:02.968
LAURA: I can't even read it. It's Zemnian.

01:59:02.968 --> 01:59:05.236
LIAM: Would you like me to read it to you sometime?

01:59:06.513 --> 01:59:09.003
LAURA: Sure.
LIAM: Okay, I will.

01:59:09.003 --> 01:59:09.836
Now, or--?

01:59:09.836 --> 01:59:11.723
LAURA: No, you can read it some other time.

01:59:11.723 --> 01:59:12.798
LIAM: Okay, all right,

01:59:12.798 --> 01:59:15.208
but I will pencil it in for you, Jester.

01:59:15.208 --> 01:59:17.200
LAURA: Thanks.
LIAM: Okay.

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.193
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:59:19.193 --> 01:59:22.035
It's good, it's good. I read it as a boy.

01:59:22.035 --> 01:59:23.023
And it's adorable.

01:59:23.023 --> 01:59:25.833
It's right up your ally, except it's in Zemnian.

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:28.726
You have a mustache.

01:59:30.867 --> 01:59:32.261
TRAVIS: Cocoa mustache.
LIAM: Too much hot cocoa.

01:59:32.261 --> 01:59:35.917
(laughter)

01:59:35.917 --> 01:59:37.733
LAURA: I go wash my face before we set off for today.

01:59:37.733 --> 01:59:39.938
MATT: Okay, okay, not an issue.

01:59:41.003 --> 01:59:43.063
As you all emerge from the tower doorway

01:59:43.063 --> 01:59:48.063
into your somewhat barren provided evening's chambers,

01:59:48.153 --> 01:59:51.363
you can already smell the fading scent

01:59:51.363 --> 01:59:53.183
of whatever morning meals were provided

01:59:53.183 --> 01:59:55.199
to the denizens of Balenpost.

01:59:55.199 --> 01:59:56.528
LIAM: Oh, we had waffles.

01:59:56.528 --> 01:59:57.576
MATT: Yeah, you guys had waffles.

01:59:57.576 --> 02:00:00.043
But you can smell the morning has come

02:00:00.043 --> 02:00:04.163
to a slow conclusion for the first risers of the day

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:08.273
that keep the fort itself safe and guarded.

02:00:08.273 --> 02:00:11.753
Making your way into the same central common area

02:00:11.753 --> 02:00:13.533
where you'd had your dinner the night before,

02:00:13.533 --> 02:00:15.123
there's only about two stragglers there

02:00:15.123 --> 02:00:16.493
in the process of finishing their meal.

02:00:16.493 --> 02:00:18.493
Other than that, it's pretty much empty.

02:00:22.523 --> 02:00:26.908
TRAVIS: Are we supposed to meet Dagen and Vess here?

02:00:28.003 --> 02:00:31.232
MARISHA: She said about 40 hours. Are we early?

02:00:31.232 --> 02:00:32.456
Did she mean tonight?
LAURA: Well, he said midday.

02:00:32.456 --> 02:00:33.456
MARISHA: Midday?
LAURA: He said midday today,

02:00:33.456 --> 02:00:35.240
we'd be heading out.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true, yeah.

02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:38.163
MARISHA: Ugh, this town is so boring.

02:00:38.163 --> 02:00:41.516
LAURA: Well, they did have cards
last night. We kind of missed it.

02:00:41.516 --> 02:00:42.690
And fighting.

02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:44.963
LIAM: Yeah, it's not so much a town, it's just--

02:00:44.963 --> 02:00:47.836
MARISHA: We missed fighting?
LAURA: I know. I meant to tell you guys.

02:00:47.836 --> 02:00:49.986
TRAVIS: No, you meant to not tell her on purpose.

02:00:51.733 --> 02:00:53.671
TALIESIN: There'll be more.
MARISHA: It's probably for the best.

02:00:53.671 --> 02:00:55.783
LIAM: You know that shiner is finally starting to fade,

02:00:55.783 --> 02:00:57.563
so it's probably good you got a good night's sleep.

02:00:57.563 --> 02:00:59.683
MARISHA: Thanks, I hope it stays a little longer.

02:00:59.683 --> 02:01:01.573
Looks like I have a little bit of makeup on.

02:01:01.573 --> 02:01:04.281
TRAVIS: Yeah, how does it feel?
And I poke right in it, poke right--

02:01:04.281 --> 02:01:05.579
MARISHA: You know, it--

02:01:05.579 --> 02:01:06.608
You know, it hurts, yeah.

02:01:06.608 --> 02:01:09.576
TRAVIS: What if I just rub a thumb?
MARISHA: That-- it's not dirt,

02:01:09.576 --> 02:01:11.823
it is blood, it's good.

02:01:11.823 --> 02:01:13.563
LIAM: Yeah, but it's under the surface, so.

02:01:13.563 --> 02:01:16.646
TALIESIN: We can put some wolf or mammoth on it.

02:01:16.646 --> 02:01:18.329
TRAVIS: Ooh yeah, just-- (claps)

02:01:18.329 --> 02:01:19.822
MARISHA: Aw!

02:01:19.822 --> 02:01:21.608
Ah, I got blood in my eye!

02:01:21.608 --> 02:01:22.549
Ah, why?

02:01:22.549 --> 02:01:24.774
LAURA: It's just a little blood, it's okay.
TRAVIS: Hold it there for at least, what,

02:01:24.774 --> 02:01:26.077
five, ten minutes?
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:01:26.077 --> 02:01:27.718
LAURA: I don't think it's good to do that anymore.

02:01:27.718 --> 02:01:30.719
It's been a few days. I don't
think it's worth anything anymore.

02:01:30.719 --> 02:01:31.785
MARISHA: It's honestly fine.

02:01:31.785 --> 02:01:33.876
LIAM: You know what will firm that up quickly,

02:01:33.876 --> 02:01:35.871
is a bit of this bat guano.

02:01:35.871 --> 02:01:38.112
MARISHA: Oh, what-- why?

02:01:38.112 --> 02:01:39.470
TALIESIN: That's got to sting.

02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:41.078
MARISHA: This feels--

02:01:41.078 --> 02:01:45.053
this feels wrong, doesn't feel medical or proven in any way.

02:01:45.053 --> 02:01:47.928
LIAM: Don't futz with it, and don't
argue with me, I'm a doctor.

02:01:47.928 --> 02:01:50.510
MARISHA: Ah, it's holistic shit.

02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:52.443
MATT: (chuckles)

02:01:52.443 --> 02:01:53.993
TRAVIS: Well, we have a few hours,

02:01:53.993 --> 02:01:56.049
what are we going to do?

02:01:57.673 --> 02:02:01.946
Jester: (singsong) Here wait for the time to go.

02:02:03.073 --> 02:02:04.133
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Pretty much.

02:02:04.133 --> 02:02:05.719
TALIESIN: We're good to go.
MATT: All right.

02:02:05.719 --> 02:02:07.246
MARISHA: Can I order, like, a bunch of bacon?

02:02:08.937 --> 02:02:11.083
MATT: Sure, you order some bacon.
LIAM: Wolf bacon?

02:02:11.083 --> 02:02:12.551
MATT: They don't have bacon.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:02:12.551 --> 02:02:13.983
MARISHA: Fuck!
TRAVIS: Come on, man.

02:02:13.983 --> 02:02:15.363
MATT: They have--
MARISHA: Pork is a luxury.

02:02:15.363 --> 02:02:16.463
MATT: Pork is definitely a luxury

02:02:16.463 --> 02:02:18.003
on this side--
TALIESIN: If they have some grain,

02:02:18.003 --> 02:02:19.153
I'll pick up some grain.

02:02:19.153 --> 02:02:20.333
If they have something that's, like,

02:02:20.333 --> 02:02:23.502
some oatmeal kind of thing that I can just carry with me.

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:24.693
MATT: Yeah, you can find that.

02:02:24.693 --> 02:02:26.783
It's a little pricier than what you'd normally pay for,

02:02:26.783 --> 02:02:28.243
which isn't much necessarily,

02:02:28.243 --> 02:02:30.546
but it's still pricey for what it is.

02:02:30.546 --> 02:02:33.354
How much do you want? Like how many days?
TALIESIN: A week's worth.

02:02:33.354 --> 02:02:34.243
MATT: A week's worth?

02:02:34.243 --> 02:02:36.266
TALIESIN: Two weeks, if it's not a lot.

02:02:37.693 --> 02:02:38.576
MATT: Two weeks worth?

02:02:38.576 --> 02:02:39.773
That'll put you at seven gold.

02:02:39.773 --> 02:02:41.339
TALIESIN: Yeah, do it.

02:02:42.639 --> 02:02:43.472
SAM: Oats.

02:02:44.573 --> 02:02:47.239
MARISHA: While we wait, I scooch over to Yasha.

02:02:47.239 --> 02:02:48.072
MATT: Okay.

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:52.273
ASHLEY: Hey, friend.

02:02:52.273 --> 02:02:54.123
LIAM: Damn it.
MARISHA: Hey, how'd you sleep?

02:02:54.123 --> 02:02:56.314
ASHLEY: I slept, uh-- I slept--

02:02:56.314 --> 02:02:57.863
I slept okay.

02:02:57.863 --> 02:02:58.696
How did you sleep?

02:02:58.696 --> 02:03:00.063
Because I feel like--

02:03:00.063 --> 02:03:02.553
I kind of heard you wrestling a little bit.

02:03:02.553 --> 02:03:04.553
MARISHA: Oh, that-- no, I was fighting.

02:03:04.553 --> 02:03:06.883
Not-- like I was doing some sparring

02:03:06.883 --> 02:03:09.043
in that little training gym.
ASHLEY: Oh, that's a good--

02:03:09.043 --> 02:03:10.363
I forgot, yeah, you have that.

02:03:10.363 --> 02:03:12.468
That's a good thing to, you know.

02:03:12.468 --> 02:03:14.290
MARISHA: Good to burn off some steam, you know?

02:03:14.290 --> 02:03:15.206
Get tired.

02:03:15.206 --> 02:03:16.913
ASHLEY: Big time.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:03:16.913 --> 02:03:18.523
ASHLEY: Big time. Burn off that--

02:03:18.523 --> 02:03:19.764
all that steam.

02:03:19.764 --> 02:03:21.597
MARISHA: (nervously) Mm hm. Mm hm.

02:03:23.433 --> 02:03:24.746
ASHLEY: How are you doing?

02:03:25.643 --> 02:03:27.460
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm-- I'm okay.

02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:30.326
I actually feel pretty, like--

02:03:30.326 --> 02:03:33.542
pretty driven and focused,

02:03:33.542 --> 02:03:35.760
you know, like I'm on like a--

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.038
ASHLEY: Like on a mission.
MARISHA: On a mission, yeah.

02:03:38.038 --> 02:03:39.760
Kind of obsessed right now.

02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:42.003
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have to say.

02:03:44.643 --> 02:03:46.662
You've figured out a lot of stuff.

02:03:46.662 --> 02:03:49.653
It's just amazing how your mind works,

02:03:49.653 --> 02:03:52.593
and I'm really proud of how you did all that

02:03:52.593 --> 02:03:54.283
and connected a lot of things.

02:03:54.283 --> 02:03:57.296
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, broken clock.

02:03:58.163 --> 02:03:59.266
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:03:59.266 --> 02:04:00.603
MARISHA: Right a couple times, you know?

02:04:00.603 --> 02:04:01.671
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:04:01.671 --> 02:04:03.683
MARISHA: It's fine, but no, it's good.

02:04:03.683 --> 02:04:08.679
I feel like I've found my calling in a weird way.

02:04:09.922 --> 02:04:11.583
ASHLEY: I think you have,

02:04:11.583 --> 02:04:14.661
I mean, it really suits you very well

02:04:16.488 --> 02:04:19.789
to do what you're doing.

02:04:21.943 --> 02:04:23.043
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

02:04:24.363 --> 02:04:27.503
I just wanted to check in

02:04:27.503 --> 02:04:30.753
because, like,

02:04:32.502 --> 02:04:33.843
several weeks ago,

02:04:33.843 --> 02:04:38.283
when we were having that dinner with Ludinus--

02:04:38.283 --> 02:04:40.547
no, sorry, it was Trent.

02:04:40.547 --> 02:04:42.957
We've had so many weird interactions

02:04:42.957 --> 02:04:45.340
with so many stuffy wizards--

02:04:46.313 --> 02:04:48.053
ASHLEY: So many stuffy wizards, oh my god.

02:04:48.053 --> 02:04:50.786
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I hate them.

02:04:50.786 --> 02:04:52.133
I really hate them all.

02:04:52.133 --> 02:04:54.710
ASHLEY: Caleb's, like, the only one--
MARISHA: (stammering) Yeah, right?!

02:04:54.710 --> 02:04:55.733
ASHLEY: He's the only one.

02:04:55.733 --> 02:04:58.923
You know, it's a different vibe.

02:04:58.923 --> 02:05:00.243
MARISHA: Right, do you think one day,

02:05:00.243 --> 02:05:02.513
he's going to, like, be a stuffy wizard?

02:05:02.513 --> 02:05:05.393
ASHLEY: I sure hope not, but I even think if he would be,

02:05:05.393 --> 02:05:06.906
he'd still be cool and fun

02:05:06.906 --> 02:05:09.699
and not like--
MARISHA: Not like that.

02:05:09.699 --> 02:05:10.983
ASHLEY: Not like that.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:05:10.983 --> 02:05:12.143
ASHLEY: We won't let him be like that.

02:05:12.143 --> 02:05:13.593
MARISHA: I agree.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:05:13.593 --> 02:05:15.303
MARISHA: Yeah, I just remember when

02:05:15.303 --> 02:05:16.933
we were having that dinner with Trent,

02:05:16.933 --> 02:05:21.503
and he started talking in our heads,

02:05:21.503 --> 02:05:23.601
and you made this face,

02:05:24.513 --> 02:05:28.809
and it made me realize that,

02:05:30.073 --> 02:05:34.913
I bet people talking in your heads is not comforting

02:05:34.913 --> 02:05:36.763
and for all that you've been through.

02:05:37.993 --> 02:05:38.989
ASHLEY: It's weird.

02:05:40.793 --> 02:05:42.344
I mean it's...

02:05:44.463 --> 02:05:46.243
I guess whenever it happens,

02:05:46.243 --> 02:05:50.833
you know, it feels like you're never alone,

02:05:50.833 --> 02:05:55.216
but not in a good way, if that makes sense.

02:05:58.335 --> 02:06:00.083
I hope it doesn't happen again,

02:06:00.083 --> 02:06:04.463
but yeah, it's not fun.

02:06:04.463 --> 02:06:07.013
MARISHA: Was that what it was like with Obann all the time?

02:06:09.953 --> 02:06:11.613
ASHLEY: Yes and no.

02:06:16.863 --> 02:06:21.863
I wasn't in charge of what I was doing,

02:06:22.653 --> 02:06:24.573
if that makes any sense.

02:06:24.573 --> 02:06:26.463
I was completely aware,

02:06:26.463 --> 02:06:31.463
but I couldn't stop myself from doing it.

02:06:34.113 --> 02:06:35.479
I think

02:06:38.596 --> 02:06:41.746
probably every single day about

02:06:43.553 --> 02:06:48.553
that time in the cathedral with you.

02:06:49.023 --> 02:06:53.763
And I don't know what I would have done

02:06:53.763 --> 02:06:57.203
if anything happened to you because of me.

02:06:59.367 --> 02:07:03.228
MARISHA: I knew it wasn't you,

02:07:05.441 --> 02:07:06.274
but,

02:07:09.603 --> 02:07:11.156
yeah, I can imagine.

02:07:12.743 --> 02:07:13.983
It actually sounds

02:07:13.983 --> 02:07:16.763
so much worse when you still have your own thoughts mixed

02:07:16.763 --> 02:07:18.605
with someone else's like--

02:07:19.493 --> 02:07:22.356
probably be easier to just be lost.

02:07:23.773 --> 02:07:26.429
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think so.

02:07:31.123 --> 02:07:31.956
Yeah.

02:07:35.411 --> 02:07:36.311
MARISHA: I just,

02:07:38.473 --> 02:07:39.306
I couldn't help

02:07:39.306 --> 02:07:42.123
but notice your face in that moment

02:07:42.123 --> 02:07:44.430
with Trent and--

02:07:45.563 --> 02:07:46.783
ASHLEY: He sucks anyway.

02:07:46.783 --> 02:07:48.396
MARISHA: He sucks.
ASHLEY: I hate him.

02:07:49.313 --> 02:07:52.476
I just, and especially him in
there, it's like, ugh, get out.

02:07:53.833 --> 02:07:58.233
MARISHA: It's a different level of invasion of privacy.

02:07:58.233 --> 02:08:00.703
Normal conversations you can walk away from. When someone's

02:08:00.703 --> 02:08:01.703
in your head...

02:08:03.173 --> 02:08:04.931
ASHLEY: Yeah. Um...

02:08:06.981 --> 02:08:08.997
I, uh...

02:08:12.963 --> 02:08:15.523
This is so stupid,

02:08:15.523 --> 02:08:16.356
but

02:08:18.713 --> 02:08:21.339
I actually wrote

02:08:23.883 --> 02:08:25.254
a poem for you.

02:08:26.243 --> 02:08:29.043
Where did I? It's--
MARISHA: What?

02:08:29.043 --> 02:08:32.898
ASHLEY: It's just, like, I was just hanging out

02:08:32.898 --> 02:08:37.743
and I wrote something down on this parchment.

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:40.143
It's very stupid-- it doesn't-- it's a stupid thing,

02:08:40.143 --> 02:08:42.453
but here.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:08:44.758 --> 02:08:47.448
ASHLEY: It doesn't--
MARISHA: Should I--

02:08:48.523 --> 02:08:49.744
Do I read it now or is it something

02:08:49.744 --> 02:08:50.577
that you--
ASHLEY: No, no, no, I mean,

02:08:50.577 --> 02:08:51.535
you can look at it later,

02:08:51.535 --> 02:08:52.673
but--
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:08:52.673 --> 02:08:55.418
ASHLEY: I mean, no pressure to--
MARISHA: No, I mean, I--

02:08:57.224 --> 02:08:58.532
you wrote me a poem.

02:08:59.903 --> 02:09:00.861
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:09:02.583 --> 02:09:04.441
MARISHA: I'll--

02:09:04.441 --> 02:09:07.891
I look forward to reading this when

02:09:07.891 --> 02:09:11.807
we are back in the tower.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:09:11.807 --> 02:09:12.640
MARISHA: Um.

02:09:14.741 --> 02:09:16.441
(laughs nervously)

02:09:16.441 --> 02:09:17.782
ASHLEY: Well, um...

02:09:19.133 --> 02:09:19.966
Now, I'm embarrassed

02:09:19.966 --> 02:09:21.029
for you to read the poem--
MARISHA: No!

02:09:21.029 --> 02:09:22.940
ASHLEY: Because I think it'll be silly.
MARISHA: It's so cool!

02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:23.773
ASHLEY: It's really corny,

02:09:23.773 --> 02:09:25.838
but I feel like--

02:09:25.838 --> 02:09:28.188
MARISHA: No one's ever written me a poem before.

02:09:29.836 --> 02:09:31.511
ASHLEY: Well, they should've.

02:09:38.123 --> 02:09:38.956
Yeah.

02:09:40.083 --> 02:09:40.916
Well,

02:09:43.753 --> 02:09:44.586
yeah.

02:09:45.603 --> 02:09:48.326
MARISHA: Yeah, I just wanted to check in on you--
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09:48.326 --> 02:09:49.643
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good--

02:09:49.643 --> 02:09:50.476
MARISHA: All right, okay.
ASHLEY: I'm okay,

02:09:50.476 --> 02:09:52.219
but thanks for checking in.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:09:52.219 --> 02:09:53.733
ASHLEY: It's all good.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:09:53.733 --> 02:09:56.816
ASHLEY: Okay, well, we're going
to have a great time out there--

02:09:56.816 --> 02:09:59.353
MARISHA: Yeah, just going on a hike.

02:09:59.353 --> 02:10:00.213
ASHLEY: Yeah, we're going to go on a hike

02:10:00.213 --> 02:10:01.046
and it's going to be--

02:10:01.046 --> 02:10:03.304
MARISHA: Tundra Hike.

02:10:03.304 --> 02:10:05.537
ASHLEY: What an adventure for the Mighty Nein.

02:10:08.493 --> 02:10:12.113
MARISHA: Okay, let's-- got to put my coat on.

02:10:12.113 --> 02:10:13.596
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too, okay.

02:10:14.463 --> 02:10:15.793
MARISHA: Is it-- are we going actually?

02:10:15.793 --> 02:10:17.143
No, like, really, I'm putting my coat

02:10:17.143 --> 02:10:17.976
on like we're leaving--

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:20.080
TRAVIS: It's 8:45.
MARISHA: -- and it might be, like, 10:00am.

02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:21.773
(laughter)

02:10:21.773 --> 02:10:24.240
Just, I'll put my backpacks on and--

02:10:25.366 --> 02:10:27.583
MATT: Yeah, is there any business you want to take care of?

02:10:27.583 --> 02:10:29.137
MARISHA: Nope.
MATT: All right.

02:10:29.137 --> 02:10:31.212
(laughter)

02:10:31.212 --> 02:10:32.187
TRAVIS: Are we back in the tower?

02:10:32.187 --> 02:10:33.854
Oh, are going to go back in the tower?

02:10:33.854 --> 02:10:35.116
(laughter)

02:10:35.116 --> 02:10:37.533
TRAVIS: We're in Aeor, right? We're in the tower?

02:10:40.203 --> 02:10:43.003
MATT: So yeah, if you guys have your supplies together,

02:10:43.003 --> 02:10:44.836
if there's anything else you need to do?

02:10:45.863 --> 02:10:47.009
The day goes on.

02:10:50.603 --> 02:10:53.019
SAM: Yeah, we can fast forward to--
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10:53.019 --> 02:10:55.069
LIAM: Yeah, I think so. We got all our supplies.

02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:56.397
TALIESIN: You're making us nervous but no, yeah, okay.

02:10:56.397 --> 02:10:58.022
LAURA: I know, yeah.
MATT: Okay, cool.

02:10:58.893 --> 02:11:00.852
TRAVIS: I mean, we'll keep a general sense

02:11:00.852 --> 02:11:03.613
of wary preparedness about us--

02:11:03.613 --> 02:11:05.083
MATT: No, of course, of course.
TRAVIS: If shit goes down.

02:11:05.083 --> 02:11:08.473
MATT: Fair enough.
TRAVIS: Barren outpost.

02:11:08.473 --> 02:11:09.983
MATT: You know, gather supplies,

02:11:09.983 --> 02:11:11.503
you wait around,

02:11:11.503 --> 02:11:15.416
snack, and people go about their business in Balenpost.

02:11:17.483 --> 02:11:22.216
No sign of Dagen, no sign of Vess yet.

02:11:23.053 --> 02:11:27.997
Kind of... mid-afternoon hits.
LAURA: I mean, yeah--

02:11:27.997 --> 02:11:29.243
TRAVIS: Mid-afternoon hits?
MATT: At this point,

02:11:29.243 --> 02:11:30.841
like, two or three o'clock in the afternoon.

02:11:30.841 --> 02:11:32.833
SAM: Like past time that we thought it would be?

02:11:32.833 --> 02:11:33.666
MATT: Yeah, possibly.

02:11:33.666 --> 02:11:36.713
You're starting to wonder where you're supposed to meet.

02:11:36.713 --> 02:11:38.623
But, you know, you've been spending most

02:11:38.623 --> 02:11:40.593
of your time here in the whereabouts

02:11:40.593 --> 02:11:42.353
of the Central Fortress.

02:11:42.353 --> 02:11:44.233
LAURA: I'm definitely going to go for a walk,

02:11:44.233 --> 02:11:47.683
because, it's boring waiting--

02:11:47.683 --> 02:11:51.225
MATT: Okay. So you go for a walk out on the the fresh snow

02:11:51.225 --> 02:11:54.033
that's fallen now since the night's come,

02:11:54.033 --> 02:11:57.903
and it is a nice, soft, flurry that's pouring in.

02:11:57.903 --> 02:12:00.936
Everyone's bottled up a little extra thick today.

02:12:02.333 --> 02:12:04.243
You can see there's a bonfire now set up

02:12:04.243 --> 02:12:05.723
in the central courtyard area

02:12:05.723 --> 02:12:06.859
and there's a few people

02:12:06.859 --> 02:12:10.253
who are throwing bits of wood onto it,

02:12:10.253 --> 02:12:12.343
and which is, you gather, probably a challenge.

02:12:12.343 --> 02:12:13.773
Most of the wood has to be brought in,

02:12:13.773 --> 02:12:16.583
or from what small elements of nearby trees

02:12:16.583 --> 02:12:17.683
that are the further north you go,

02:12:17.683 --> 02:12:19.256
the fewer and fewer trees there are.

02:12:19.256 --> 02:12:20.089
LAURA: Oh.

02:12:21.283 --> 02:12:22.543
MATT: But there is a bit of a bonfire there.

02:12:22.543 --> 02:12:24.293
Some people are warming themselves.

02:12:26.003 --> 02:12:29.527
You do glance over and by the fire you see,

02:12:29.527 --> 02:12:31.823
in his awesome-looking chair,

02:12:31.823 --> 02:12:34.653
you see Dagen sitting there with a blanket over him

02:12:34.653 --> 02:12:38.803
with a big old, it looks like a bowl,

02:12:38.803 --> 02:12:42.469
just sitting there, and he just looks pretty wrecked.

02:12:42.469 --> 02:12:43.761
LAURA: Oh.

02:12:43.761 --> 02:12:46.003
MARISHA: A bowl, like a bowl?

02:12:46.003 --> 02:12:48.971
MATT: Like a of a large basin of some kind.

02:12:48.971 --> 02:12:50.930
MARISHA: Uh-ohs. Oh no.

02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:53.225
TALIESIN: It's an outtie basin.
A basin-- not an innie basin.

02:12:53.225 --> 02:12:55.367
TRAVIS: Smoking fatties [inaudible] six-foot stand-up.
MATT: Can't tell from here.

02:12:55.367 --> 02:12:57.808
MARISHA: Yeah. You got to specify.

02:12:57.808 --> 02:12:59.041
TRAVIS: Somebody else has got to pull it for you.

02:12:59.041 --> 02:13:00.165
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: Oh my god.

02:13:00.165 --> 02:13:01.007
TRAVIS: On three!

02:13:01.007 --> 02:13:03.007
MARISHA: Go upstairs, man, yeah.

02:13:04.614 --> 02:13:07.420
SAM: What are you guys talking about?
LAURA: I'll make a-- yeah.

02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:09.033
TRAVIS: It's got a gargoyle base. It's really cool.

02:13:09.033 --> 02:13:11.190
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just got for this Christmas, bro.

02:13:11.190 --> 02:13:12.863
MATT: Not a lot to do in Balenpost, you know?

02:13:12.863 --> 02:13:14.784
LIAM: Travis, is that what those pipes do on your back?

02:13:14.784 --> 02:13:16.356
TRAVIS: They do.

02:13:16.356 --> 02:13:17.393
That's why there's three.

02:13:17.393 --> 02:13:18.691
SAM: We've got some good grass over here, too.

02:13:18.691 --> 02:13:19.732
MATT: There's a reason--

02:13:19.732 --> 02:13:22.682
(laughter)

02:13:22.682 --> 02:13:24.773
TRAVIS: Look at her head!

02:13:24.773 --> 02:13:26.300
MATT: Orly and Henry should never meet.

02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:27.493
(laughter)

02:13:27.493 --> 02:13:30.463
SAM: We got pipes and some grass.

02:13:30.463 --> 02:13:31.623
MATT: Yeah.

02:13:31.623 --> 02:13:34.571
LAURA: I'll walk over to Dagen.

02:13:36.051 --> 02:13:38.213
(crunches)

02:13:38.213 --> 02:13:39.310
TRAVIS: Good foley.
LAURA: Thank you.

02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:40.810
MATT: "(grunts)

02:13:40.810 --> 02:13:44.076
"Hey there, morning."
LAURA: Hard night?

02:13:45.653 --> 02:13:47.956
MATT: "Normal night."
LAURA: Oh, really?

02:13:48.993 --> 02:13:50.503
Alcohol warms you up.

02:13:50.503 --> 02:13:52.931
MATT: "I know. It's cold."

02:13:54.243 --> 02:13:55.076
LAURA: I like it.

02:13:56.886 --> 02:13:57.886
When are we leaving?

02:13:59.223 --> 02:14:01.083
MATT: "I don't know. I'm waiting on the rest of you

02:14:01.083 --> 02:14:02.653
"to come find me, so--"

02:14:02.653 --> 02:14:05.723
LAURA: Oh, we were waiting in the fricking--

02:14:05.723 --> 02:14:07.012
hold on, I'll go get everyone.

02:14:07.012 --> 02:14:08.693
Would you-- wait, wait.

02:14:08.693 --> 02:14:12.773
Do I need to get Vess DeRogna, too? Lady DeRogna.

02:14:12.773 --> 02:14:14.366
Do I need to get Lady DeRogna?

02:14:14.366 --> 02:14:15.973
MATT: "I haven't seen her."

02:14:17.056 --> 02:14:17.889
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:19.918 --> 02:14:23.333
Okay, you're just going to be here by the bonfire?

02:14:23.333 --> 02:14:25.113
MATT: "Don't have much else I want to do."

02:14:25.113 --> 02:14:28.983
And you can gather from a brief glance look there's,

02:14:28.983 --> 02:14:31.683
you know, thankfully not an out bowl.

02:14:31.683 --> 02:14:33.273
This actually is filled with water

02:14:33.273 --> 02:14:34.513
and it has a little bit of frost on the sides.

02:14:34.513 --> 02:14:36.440
He's just been chugging--
LAURA: Okay, good.

02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.183
MATT: Trying to rehydrate.

02:14:38.183 --> 02:14:39.740
But you can see as you're sitting there,

02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:41.373
the frost is gathering at the edges of his beard

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:42.323
where the water has spilled down

02:14:42.323 --> 02:14:43.953
and it's freezing in the hair.

02:14:43.953 --> 02:14:46.703
Occasionally, he has to flick the ice crystals out.

02:14:48.257 --> 02:14:49.413
But yeah.

02:14:49.413 --> 02:14:52.806
LAURA: Okay, well, I'll see you in a little bit.

02:14:52.806 --> 02:14:54.703
MATT: "Okay."
LAURA: Do you need anything?

02:14:54.703 --> 02:14:56.903
MATT: "No, I've got everything packed up and ready to go.

02:14:56.903 --> 02:15:00.373
"You just let me know when and I'll grab my supplies."

02:15:00.373 --> 02:15:03.160
LAURA: Okie dokie!
MATT: "Okay."

02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:05.410
LAURA: (crunches)

02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.799
Dagen's out by the bonfire.

02:15:10.799 --> 02:15:12.407
He's just waiting for us.
TRAVIS: He's just waiting out there?

02:15:12.407 --> 02:15:13.550
TALIESIN: Wow.
LAURA: Well, I don't know

02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:16.963
because Lady DeRogna isn't down yet, so--

02:15:16.963 --> 02:15:18.999
TRAVIS: Right, is she staying here?

02:15:18.999 --> 02:15:21.163
LAURA: She was staying here. She was staying upstairs.

02:15:21.163 --> 02:15:22.966
SAM: Should we go knock on her door?

02:15:24.023 --> 02:15:25.413
LAURA: I mean.

02:15:25.413 --> 02:15:28.193
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go to the tavern keep

02:15:28.193 --> 02:15:31.431
and ask if they know which room Lady DeRogna's in.

02:15:31.431 --> 02:15:33.453
MATT: You pass by one of the
people who's just in the process

02:15:33.453 --> 02:15:36.447
of cleaning up the messes from this morning feed.

02:15:36.447 --> 02:15:37.963
Yeah. It's tavern-esque.

02:15:37.963 --> 02:15:39.553
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Yeah.

02:15:39.553 --> 02:15:41.211
This is a younger fellow in his 30s,

02:15:41.211 --> 02:15:44.116
half-elven background.

02:15:45.063 --> 02:15:47.620
Looks like he's pretty chilly

02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:50.529
and not enjoying his time here, but glances over and says,

02:15:50.529 --> 02:15:53.123
"Well, the visiting suite's on the third floor.

02:15:53.123 --> 02:15:55.053
"It's pretty much the third floor.

02:15:55.053 --> 02:15:57.603
"Hard to miss. It's where all of the

02:15:57.603 --> 02:16:00.963
"Assembly and Assembly-adjacent folk usually crash out."

02:16:00.963 --> 02:16:03.263
TRAVIS: Third floor, yes. That's where we are.

02:16:03.263 --> 02:16:06.843
Is there a specific room that she might frequent?

02:16:06.843 --> 02:16:08.093
MATT: "Oh, it's only one room."

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:10.551
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, right.

02:16:10.551 --> 02:16:11.843
SAM: We're at the base.
LAURA: We're on the ground floor.

02:16:11.843 --> 02:16:13.933
TRAVIS: We are on the ground floor.
MATT: "Right, right."

02:16:13.933 --> 02:16:16.935
TRAVIS: See you in a bit, Slick.

02:16:16.935 --> 02:16:19.251
MATT: "It's not my name," as you walk away.

02:16:19.251 --> 02:16:20.373
(laughter)

02:16:20.373 --> 02:16:22.183
TRAVIS: Third floor.
SAM: It's actually Slock.

02:16:22.183 --> 02:16:23.069
MATT: Yeah.

02:16:23.069 --> 02:16:25.033
(laughter)

02:16:25.033 --> 02:16:25.916
TRAVIS: Slack.

02:16:27.383 --> 02:16:30.345
I'm going to go up and--
LAURA: I'll go with you.

02:16:30.345 --> 02:16:32.033
MATT: Okay, you go up.

02:16:32.033 --> 02:16:33.608
The first floor, which has--

02:16:33.608 --> 02:16:35.558
it's the big fortress base

02:16:35.558 --> 02:16:39.968
where most of the common guards and some other folk

02:16:39.968 --> 02:16:43.653
that run the general operational aspects

02:16:43.653 --> 02:16:45.303
of the fortress tend to stay.

02:16:45.303 --> 02:16:47.853
The second floor seems to have another common area.

02:16:47.853 --> 02:16:52.025
This one is a little more game room, if you will.

02:16:52.025 --> 02:16:53.513
You can see there's some stacks of cards

02:16:53.513 --> 02:16:56.588
and dominoes and dice elements in some places.

02:16:56.588 --> 02:16:58.123
There are bunkers and barracks,

02:16:58.123 --> 02:17:00.203
and you can see there are soldiers in there

02:17:00.203 --> 02:17:02.093
that are just resting at the moment

02:17:02.093 --> 02:17:05.743
and trying to delay the need,

02:17:05.743 --> 02:17:07.063
'til their next shift comes out.

02:17:07.063 --> 02:17:08.943
So there's like probably about 12 or 13

02:17:08.943 --> 02:17:11.806
or so armed individuals down in this space.

02:17:13.373 --> 02:17:15.183
You go up the next flight

02:17:15.183 --> 02:17:18.453
into the smallest third tier.

02:17:18.453 --> 02:17:20.823
And as you come up the stairs, it curves around

02:17:20.823 --> 02:17:24.363
and switch backs and you come immediately to a wooden door

02:17:24.363 --> 02:17:26.403
with three iron crossbars on it

02:17:26.403 --> 02:17:30.823
with a nice heavy turn brass knob on it.

02:17:30.823 --> 02:17:32.763
It definitely stands out from the rest of the make here.

02:17:32.763 --> 02:17:34.393
This is a very nice door

02:17:34.393 --> 02:17:38.003
for a relatively not nice construct.

02:17:38.003 --> 02:17:39.153
TRAVIS: I imagine this is it.

02:17:40.956 --> 02:17:44.398
LAURA: (knocks) Hello?

02:17:46.593 --> 02:17:47.618
MATT: No response.

02:17:47.618 --> 02:17:49.353
LAURA: I wonder if she's in, like, a magical room.

02:17:49.353 --> 02:17:51.363
TRAVIS: She might be. You should kick it, kick the door.

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:52.196
LAURA: I'm not going to kick the door.

02:17:52.196 --> 02:17:53.123
TRAVIS: Just like hard knock.

02:17:53.123 --> 02:17:55.312
I'll go and (boof boof).

02:17:55.312 --> 02:17:58.062
LAURA: (knocks) Hello, hello, hello!

02:17:59.963 --> 02:18:01.705
MATT: No response, but you do hear some footfalls

02:18:01.705 --> 02:18:03.161
and you see some of the armed people

02:18:03.161 --> 02:18:05.880
glance up the staircase at you.

02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:06.841
Just to check in--
TRAVIS: I'll just go

02:18:06.841 --> 02:18:08.513
halfway down the staircase.

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:12.643
Lady DeRogna, has she emerged today?

02:18:12.643 --> 02:18:14.583
MATT: They all look at each other.

02:18:14.583 --> 02:18:16.773
"No, I haven't seen her, why?"

02:18:16.773 --> 02:18:19.783
TRAVIS: Oh, no, we're just little past our departure time.

02:18:19.783 --> 02:18:22.366
No reason for concern. (sucks in breath)

02:18:22.366 --> 02:18:24.853
Um. (clicks)

02:18:24.853 --> 02:18:27.053
Did she give you a way to get her attention?

02:18:28.453 --> 02:18:30.263
MATT: "Knock?"

02:18:30.263 --> 02:18:34.652
LAURA: Yeah, of course, duh! We know... to knock.

02:18:34.652 --> 02:18:35.763
TRAVIS: Do you want to send her a message?

02:18:35.763 --> 02:18:37.623
LAURA: Oh, good idea, Fjord!

02:18:37.623 --> 02:18:38.783
Yeah, I'm going to send a message.

02:18:38.783 --> 02:18:39.616
MATT: Okay.

02:18:40.813 --> 02:18:44.043
LAURA: Hello, we're outside your room.

02:18:44.043 --> 02:18:45.503
Are we planning to leave soon?

02:18:45.503 --> 02:18:47.946
We're just wondering, just waiting.

02:18:49.703 --> 02:18:52.451
Dagen's ready so.

02:18:52.451 --> 02:18:53.984
Oh!

02:18:54.970 --> 02:18:56.492
What're you doing?

02:18:58.158 --> 02:19:00.213
TRAVIS: "What're you doing," right?

02:19:00.213 --> 02:19:01.263
LAURA: What're, yeah.
TRAVIS: Contraction.

02:19:01.263 --> 02:19:03.216
MATT: There you go.
LAURA: What you doing?

02:19:04.763 --> 02:19:06.721
MATT: Moment passes,

02:19:06.721 --> 02:19:10.496
then another moment passes,

02:19:12.846 --> 02:19:14.564
then a few moments pass.

02:19:17.393 --> 02:19:18.365
No response.

02:19:18.365 --> 02:19:20.106
LAURA: (gasps) She's not responding.

02:19:20.106 --> 02:19:20.953
Fjord, she's not responding.

02:19:20.953 --> 02:19:22.764
TRAVIS: No, I know, but she could be in her tower, right?

02:19:22.764 --> 02:19:23.785
I don't think a message would reach her.

02:19:23.785 --> 02:19:25.153
LAURA: Yes it does, it goes across all planes.

02:19:25.153 --> 02:19:26.096
It goes anywhere.

02:19:27.633 --> 02:19:28.520
TRAVIS: No, are you sure?

02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.180
LAURA: Yes, I know, I know, I know.

02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:31.421
TRAVIS: Wait, you could be in another plane,

02:19:31.421 --> 02:19:33.604
another realm, another and it would find them?

02:19:33.604 --> 02:19:35.103
LAURA: Yeah.

02:19:35.103 --> 02:19:37.003
This message thing is really awesome.

02:19:37.003 --> 02:19:38.623
The Traveler's a powerful guy, man.

02:19:38.623 --> 02:19:40.005
He teaches me some crazy things.

02:19:40.005 --> 02:19:40.953
TRAVIS: What did she say she was doing?

02:19:40.953 --> 02:19:41.983
She said she had meeting.

02:19:41.983 --> 02:19:43.173
She said, "40 hours,"

02:19:43.173 --> 02:19:45.003
which is a bit longer--
LAURA: She did say, "40 hours,"

02:19:45.003 --> 02:19:47.226
That's two days, almost.

02:19:48.118 --> 02:19:49.180
But--

02:19:50.293 --> 02:19:51.422
TRAVIS: Should we--
LAURA: Oh my gosh,

02:19:51.422 --> 02:19:54.713
what if what Molly was saying was, like, some sort of clue

02:19:54.713 --> 02:19:56.326
and he was coming after her,

02:19:57.657 --> 02:19:59.196
and we were supposed to let her know?

02:20:00.343 --> 02:20:02.743
TRAVIS: That does seem a bit concerning at the moment.

02:20:05.499 --> 02:20:07.732
MARISHA: (high pitched) It's totally not!

02:20:07.732 --> 02:20:08.565
Sorry.

02:20:09.573 --> 02:20:11.186
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: I'm not there.

02:20:12.693 --> 02:20:14.046
LAURA: Are you sure?

02:20:14.046 --> 02:20:16.296
(laughter)

02:20:17.793 --> 02:20:18.833
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a concern.

02:20:18.833 --> 02:20:19.666
Do you want to--

02:20:19.666 --> 02:20:22.543
can you scry across all planes?
LAURA: (door rattling)

02:20:22.543 --> 02:20:24.493
MATT: The door is locked. It's not opening.

02:20:28.103 --> 02:20:29.558
TRAVIS: I'm going to head back down the stairs

02:20:29.558 --> 02:20:32.653
and just be like: I think we may have a situation

02:20:32.653 --> 02:20:36.561
in which we need to enter Lady DeRogna's premises.

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:37.423
MARISHA: What do you really mean?

02:20:37.423 --> 02:20:39.165
SAM: Are you talking to Slock or to us?
MATT: Are you talking to soldiers?

02:20:39.165 --> 02:20:40.098
TRAVIS: No, not you fucks,

02:20:40.098 --> 02:20:41.611
keep the pantomiming to yourself.

02:20:41.611 --> 02:20:42.594
MARISHA: Oh.

02:20:42.594 --> 02:20:44.248
(laughter)

02:20:44.248 --> 02:20:46.193
LAURA: Oh, we're talking to the soldiers?

02:20:46.193 --> 02:20:47.073
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh,

02:20:47.073 --> 02:20:49.323
I thought you were talking to--
MATT: The soldiers, they look at each other,

02:20:49.323 --> 02:20:50.726
like, "Oh, we're--

02:20:53.393 --> 02:20:55.883
"the chambers are for Assembly members only."

02:20:55.883 --> 02:20:57.733
TRAVIS: Right, but surely you have some way to get in there,

02:20:57.733 --> 02:20:59.683
especially, if they're in grave danger.

02:21:00.653 --> 02:21:02.933
Do you not?
LAURA: Maybe she's just pooping.

02:21:02.933 --> 02:21:04.233
You know, some people just don't like to talk.

02:21:04.233 --> 02:21:05.903
MATT: "Why would they be in grave danger?"

02:21:05.903 --> 02:21:06.803
TRAVIS: I don't know.

02:21:06.803 --> 02:21:08.873
I assume when the party that she's contracted

02:21:08.873 --> 02:21:11.343
to keep her safe can't reach her,

02:21:11.343 --> 02:21:12.796
then she might be in danger.

02:21:13.823 --> 02:21:15.946
You do like this job, don't you?

02:21:17.616 --> 02:21:19.598
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:21:19.598 --> 02:21:22.568
SAM: Poor Slock.
LAURA: Poor Slock.

02:21:24.073 --> 02:21:25.079
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:21:25.079 --> 02:21:26.643
SAM: Ooh!
TRAVIS: For a 30.

02:21:26.643 --> 02:21:28.123
ASHLEY: Hey!

02:21:28.123 --> 02:21:29.381
MATT: He goes,

02:21:29.381 --> 02:21:34.381
"I'll go talk to Akron.

02:21:34.823 --> 02:21:36.398
"You four, come with me."

02:21:37.483 --> 02:21:39.833
TRAVIS: We'll take that opportunity to head downstairs.

02:21:39.833 --> 02:21:42.673
MATT: Okay. The soldiers there, all giving you--

02:21:42.673 --> 02:21:44.343
The one is still giving you this intense look,

02:21:44.343 --> 02:21:45.646
the other ones are like--

02:21:47.363 --> 02:21:49.304
TRAVIS: She's not answering

02:21:49.304 --> 02:21:50.945
and Jester tried to send a message

02:21:50.945 --> 02:21:51.786
and she didn't respond.

02:21:51.786 --> 02:21:52.943
LAURA: She didn't respond, she may be pooping,

02:21:52.943 --> 02:21:54.363
or she could be in grave danger.

02:21:54.363 --> 02:21:57.733
SAM: Either way, we should go find out, because--

02:21:57.733 --> 02:21:59.913
TRAVIS: We are contracted to protect her

02:21:59.913 --> 02:22:01.653
and we didn't really make any arrangements

02:22:01.653 --> 02:22:03.723
for, I don't know, a signal or a message,

02:22:03.723 --> 02:22:06.443
in case that we lost track of her through the night.

02:22:06.443 --> 02:22:08.443
SAM: She's super powerful! She can defend herself.

02:22:08.443 --> 02:22:10.213
She doesn't need us to defend her at night.

02:22:10.213 --> 02:22:13.693
She has domes to sleep under and shit like that, right?

02:22:13.693 --> 02:22:15.160
TRAVIS: No, we're super powerful and shit happens

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:16.673
to us at night all the time.

02:22:16.673 --> 02:22:19.336
MARISHA: Yeah, Fjord totally died sleeping.

02:22:19.336 --> 02:22:20.427
He totally got stabbed

02:22:20.427 --> 02:22:22.093
in the middle of the night.
LIAM: Strange that it would happen here.

02:22:22.093 --> 02:22:24.213
I think we should barge our way in.

02:22:24.213 --> 02:22:25.773
MARISHA: I think we should bust down the door.

02:22:25.773 --> 02:22:27.198
LAURA: What if Molly was, like--

02:22:27.198 --> 02:22:28.989
MARISHA: In her room last night,

02:22:28.989 --> 02:22:31.196
right under our noses?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:31.196 --> 02:22:32.545
MARISHA: What if that's what he meant?

02:22:32.545 --> 02:22:34.763
SAM: Wait, did you scry on Molly, former Molly,

02:22:34.763 --> 02:22:36.343
after she left the table?

02:22:36.343 --> 02:22:38.483
Right, she was gone already.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:40.833
SAM: So he could have been like--
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:40.833 --> 02:22:43.013
SAM: -- Vess-napping her at the moment.

02:22:43.013 --> 02:22:44.803
MARISHA: What if that was the scent?

02:22:44.803 --> 02:22:47.123
What if that's what it was that he was talking?

02:22:47.123 --> 02:22:49.673
But what if--

02:22:49.673 --> 02:22:51.099
LAURA: To alpha and alpha.

02:22:51.099 --> 02:22:52.213
SAM: Well, let's go find out!
MARISHA: Let's go.

02:22:52.213 --> 02:22:53.322
SAM: Let's go find out!

02:22:53.322 --> 02:22:54.333
MARISHA: Yasha!

02:22:54.333 --> 02:22:55.815
SAM: Wait, I can pick a lock.

02:22:55.815 --> 02:22:57.893
I-- yeah, yeah.
MATT: (laughs)

02:22:57.893 --> 02:22:59.731
SAM: Yeah, Yasha, yeah, bust down the door.

02:22:59.731 --> 02:23:00.763
LAURA: No, no, you do.

02:23:00.763 --> 02:23:02.673
SAM: All right, all right, we'll scramble upstairs.

02:23:02.673 --> 02:23:04.426
Are there soldiers there, or we've--?

02:23:04.426 --> 02:23:06.173
MATT: No, they've all--

02:23:06.173 --> 02:23:08.393
well, there's two left in the room,

02:23:08.393 --> 02:23:10.423
that are just watching you as you pass by

02:23:10.423 --> 02:23:11.550
and you head up to the door

02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:13.217
and there's nobody up there at the moment.

02:23:13.217 --> 02:23:14.356
SAM: Mage Hand!

02:23:14.356 --> 02:23:18.606
MATT: All right, go ahead and make pick lock, then.

02:23:19.763 --> 02:23:21.071
SAM: 29.

02:23:21.071 --> 02:23:22.462
MATT: 29 will do it.

02:23:23.598 --> 02:23:26.092
MARISHA: Yasha, kick it down anyway!

02:23:26.092 --> 02:23:28.404
TRAVIS: Got it. (smashing)

02:23:28.404 --> 02:23:30.243
MATT: So (lock clicks, creaking, impacts)

02:23:30.243 --> 02:23:33.096
The rest of it gets kicked forward with Yasha's foot.

02:23:34.753 --> 02:23:36.393
Immediately, the first thing that gets you

02:23:36.393 --> 02:23:38.834
is a very cold sensation.

02:23:38.834 --> 02:23:40.646
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: As you walk in,

02:23:40.646 --> 02:23:41.879
there is a bit of snow

02:23:41.879 --> 02:23:44.043
that is gathered and scattered across the floor

02:23:44.043 --> 02:23:46.123
of a chamber that to you, Jester, looks very familiar.

02:23:46.123 --> 02:23:48.381
ALL: (exclaiming)
LAURA: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

02:23:48.381 --> 02:23:52.189
MARISHA: Oh my god, through the window!
MATT: You can see the open window

02:23:52.189 --> 02:23:53.857
off to the left hand side

02:23:53.857 --> 02:23:57.563
of what is a beautiful suite, very well-outfitted

02:23:57.563 --> 02:24:00.074
and feels very out of place from the rest of Balenpost.

02:24:00.074 --> 02:24:02.043
You can see--
MARISHA: We didn't question--

02:24:02.043 --> 02:24:03.870
TRAVIS: Under our fucking--
LIAM: Could've been anywhere.

02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:04.703
Could've been anywhere!

02:24:04.703 --> 02:24:07.143
MATT: And you can see there are
books scattered on the ground.

02:24:07.143 --> 02:24:11.283
There are open cases and you can see there is a one case

02:24:11.283 --> 02:24:13.033
that is open and turned over,

02:24:13.933 --> 02:24:17.160
at the foot of the large, four-posted bed.

02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:18.623
LIAM: Oh, I start Will Grahaming the room.

02:24:18.623 --> 02:24:21.318
I'm looking at all the books, the case that's been open.

02:24:21.318 --> 02:24:24.102
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.
TRAVIS: While we were fucking here.

02:24:24.102 --> 02:24:27.483
MARISHA: I mean, we made all
the connections, but that <i>one</i>!

02:24:27.483 --> 02:24:29.073
MATT: And as you glance about the room,

02:24:29.073 --> 02:24:30.463
the other thing that catches your attention,

02:24:30.463 --> 02:24:32.613
is the humanoid shape lying on the bed.

02:24:32.613 --> 02:24:34.113
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up.

02:24:34.113 --> 02:24:35.905
MARISHA: She's dead.
LAURA: He killed her?

02:24:35.905 --> 02:24:38.034
TRAVIS: We-- we--
LAURA: Wait, I don't--

02:24:38.034 --> 02:24:40.951
SAM: Caduceus! Look at them!
TRAVIS: Check. Life. Check life.

02:24:40.951 --> 02:24:42.381
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying.
SAM: Check for life.

02:24:42.381 --> 02:24:45.113
TRAVIS: I make myself look like Vess DeRogna instantly

02:24:45.113 --> 02:24:48.283
and I shut the door and stand outside.

02:24:48.283 --> 02:24:49.116
MATT: Okay.

02:24:50.853 --> 02:24:54.623
You go and check this figure as you approach.

02:24:54.623 --> 02:24:57.266
This is indeed Vess DeRogna.

02:24:58.683 --> 02:25:01.016
Flesh pale,

02:25:01.016 --> 02:25:03.057
life long gone,

02:25:03.057 --> 02:25:05.273
streams of blood pouring from her eyes,

02:25:05.273 --> 02:25:07.256
her nose, her mouth, her ears.

02:25:09.047 --> 02:25:11.563
The expression itself

02:25:11.563 --> 02:25:16.116
aghast and locked in absolute horror and pain.

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:20.263
And because of your passive perception,

02:25:20.263 --> 02:25:24.216
as you glance down, you also see there's a strange

02:25:25.653 --> 02:25:27.386
coloration on her neck.

02:25:29.023 --> 02:25:30.053
And you go and pull back,

02:25:30.053 --> 02:25:31.773
and there on the right side of her neck,

02:25:31.773 --> 02:25:34.793
you see a marking that resembles a red eye.

02:25:34.793 --> 02:25:38.186
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:25:39.953 --> 02:25:43.343
We didn't make it one day.
MARISHA: This close, this close.

02:25:43.343 --> 02:25:44.993
MATT: You can--
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:25:44.993 --> 02:25:47.683
Why didn't I think one step further?

02:25:47.683 --> 02:25:50.933
MATT: The right hand where the sleeve is pulled back,

02:25:50.933 --> 02:25:53.821
you see in the palm, another similar red eye.

02:25:55.533 --> 02:25:57.295
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.
LIAM: On DeRogna?

02:25:57.295 --> 02:25:58.633
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep checking.

02:25:58.633 --> 02:26:00.013
LAURA: Are these fresh eyes?
MATT: On the other side.

02:26:00.013 --> 02:26:02.323
LAURA: Have these been put on there--

02:26:02.323 --> 02:26:03.653
LIAM: Are they in places that we were able

02:26:03.653 --> 02:26:04.943
to see visibly before,

02:26:04.943 --> 02:26:06.073
or were they--
MATT: They were.

02:26:06.073 --> 02:26:07.446
LIAM: Yeah, so this is new.

02:26:09.173 --> 02:26:12.731
MATT: You can see these are deep set red eye-like designs.

02:26:12.731 --> 02:26:15.572
MATT: You can see these are deep set red eye-like designs.

02:26:17.574 --> 02:26:20.003
The front of the palm-- Or in the palm,

02:26:20.003 --> 02:26:22.243
back of the hand, and on the side of the neck,

02:26:22.243 --> 02:26:25.808
from what you can see. The rest of her is currently covered.

02:26:27.453 --> 02:26:28.823
LIAM: I'm rolling this room,

02:26:28.823 --> 02:26:32.443
and I'm not above taking anything that belonged to her,

02:26:32.443 --> 02:26:34.373
that was not stolen from the room.

02:26:34.373 --> 02:26:35.880
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:40.493
MARISHA: I'm mad at myself.
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:26:40.493 --> 02:26:41.326
SAM: What did you say?

02:26:41.326 --> 02:26:43.053
LIAM: Natural 20 for a 31.

02:26:43.053 --> 02:26:44.076
MATT: For a 31?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:26:44.076 --> 02:26:46.023
MATT: Dang, you guys are rolling the 20s today.

02:26:46.023 --> 02:26:48.891
LIAM: It's the same die that
rolled so well in the other game!

02:26:48.891 --> 02:26:50.324
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit her with Gentle Repose,

02:26:50.324 --> 02:26:51.682
just to have it.

02:26:51.682 --> 02:26:52.515
MATT: Okay.

02:26:56.233 --> 02:26:58.523
SAM: Should we raise her from the dead?

02:26:58.523 --> 02:26:59.583
Do we have that ability?

02:26:59.583 --> 02:27:02.158
TALIESIN: I mean, I don't have that now.

02:27:02.158 --> 02:27:05.157
LAURA: I don't have it.
SAM: Revivify or something, or?

02:27:05.157 --> 02:27:08.443
LAURA: Revivify, she's been dead a lot longer than a minute.

02:27:08.443 --> 02:27:10.555
TALIESIN: Yeah, she's--
SAM: Well, what's the other one?

02:27:10.555 --> 02:27:12.107
TALIESIN: That's a lot.
LAURA: Resurrection.

02:27:12.107 --> 02:27:14.630
TRAVIS: No, we're not doing that.

02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:16.273
LIAM: Okay, well, here's what we could do.

02:27:16.273 --> 02:27:19.313
We could have you, in the form of DeRogna,

02:27:19.313 --> 02:27:22.363
go and tell Dagen that we need another day before we leave.

02:27:22.363 --> 02:27:26.133
And then we drag her inside of my tower for the night,

02:27:26.133 --> 02:27:28.423
and we do what we need to do tomorrow.

02:27:28.423 --> 02:27:30.333
TRAVIS: Yes, agreed.

02:27:30.333 --> 02:27:33.463
MATT: You, from the open window,

02:27:33.463 --> 02:27:35.583
you can see down in the central area now,

02:27:35.583 --> 02:27:39.003
there's a gathering of about 25 or so soldiers

02:27:39.003 --> 02:27:43.703
that are all around Arkhan--

02:27:43.703 --> 02:27:46.278
oh sorry, Akron Wardlaw,

02:27:46.278 --> 02:27:47.983
who first greeted you when you arrived,

02:27:47.983 --> 02:27:49.649
and it looks like they're all making their way

02:27:49.649 --> 02:27:51.319
towards the fort.

02:27:51.319 --> 02:27:52.673
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:27:52.673 --> 02:27:53.516
Okay, hang on.

02:27:54.503 --> 02:27:56.263
SAM: Are there any other eyes on her body?

02:27:56.263 --> 02:27:57.810
Can we just, like, lift a couple of--

02:27:57.810 --> 02:27:59.936
MATT: If you want to, make an investigation check.

02:27:59.936 --> 02:28:01.685
MARISHA: They've got to all be the same place.

02:28:01.685 --> 02:28:02.772
SAM: All right, I'm just going to inspect the body

02:28:02.772 --> 02:28:04.355
for anything, including eyes.

02:28:04.355 --> 02:28:05.463
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Checking the room.

02:28:05.463 --> 02:28:06.296
SAM: 28.

02:28:06.296 --> 02:28:08.604
TRAVIS: I open the door, and I ask Jester

02:28:08.604 --> 02:28:10.413
to come outside and join me.

02:28:10.413 --> 02:28:11.865
MATT: Okay.

02:28:11.865 --> 02:28:13.573
You do notice there are spaces in the body

02:28:13.573 --> 02:28:17.463
where jewelry was worn,

02:28:17.463 --> 02:28:19.653
like an area where you see bracelets and rings,

02:28:19.653 --> 02:28:21.353
and there are areas in the skin

02:28:21.353 --> 02:28:23.203
that show that there was a lot of jewelry

02:28:23.203 --> 02:28:25.273
that you've seen her wear, all removed.

02:28:25.273 --> 02:28:26.473
She's been picked clean.

02:28:28.543 --> 02:28:29.463
But you do discover,

02:28:29.463 --> 02:28:31.283
as you inspect through it,

02:28:31.283 --> 02:28:33.763
there is the red eye in the neck,

02:28:33.763 --> 02:28:36.546
there is the red eye on the palm and the back of the hand.

02:28:37.883 --> 02:28:42.023
You also see two over the heart on her chest.

02:28:42.023 --> 02:28:44.963
Side to side, one in the middle of the shoulder blades,

02:28:44.963 --> 02:28:46.456
one at the nape of the neck,

02:28:47.483 --> 02:28:49.526
actually hidden underneath the hairline.

02:28:50.713 --> 02:28:52.263
TRAVIS: Knife wounds?
MARISHA: Same places.

02:28:52.263 --> 02:28:53.443
TRAVIS: You said knife wounds?

02:28:53.443 --> 02:28:55.514
MATT: No, these are all the red eyes.

02:28:55.514 --> 02:28:57.089
SAM: Do I count nine total?

02:28:57.089 --> 02:28:58.155
MATT: You count nine eyes total.

02:28:58.155 --> 02:28:59.553
SAM: And do they look like they--

02:28:59.553 --> 02:29:02.135
these are objects, or drawings, or carvings?

02:29:02.135 --> 02:29:04.736
MATT: They would almost be tattoos,

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:08.833
but they're too clean.

02:29:08.833 --> 02:29:10.693
There's no scar detail.

02:29:10.693 --> 02:29:12.123
There's no--
SAM: And they don't look like

02:29:12.123 --> 02:29:13.983
they're pasted on. They've been integrated

02:29:13.983 --> 02:29:15.253
to her skin somehow?
MATT: Correct.

02:29:15.253 --> 02:29:17.160
TRAVIS: Followed us in from the goddamn dock.

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:20.113
SAM: And no redness around those areas?

02:29:20.113 --> 02:29:21.363
MATT: Make a medicine check for me.

02:29:21.363 --> 02:29:23.243
TRAVIS: We thought we were chasing him down,

02:29:23.243 --> 02:29:24.343
and he was just waiting.

02:29:24.343 --> 02:29:26.033
MARISHA: Made the connection between the book.

02:29:26.033 --> 02:29:27.756
MATT: 12?
MARISHA: Made the connection between the book,

02:29:27.756 --> 02:29:30.359
didn't think of--
MATT: You do not see any signs

02:29:30.359 --> 02:29:32.493
of them being recent.

02:29:32.493 --> 02:29:35.583
ASHLEY: So these were all,

02:29:35.583 --> 02:29:36.893
from what we can see,

02:29:36.893 --> 02:29:40.303
they were places where she had them covered

02:29:40.303 --> 02:29:42.097
with, like, jewelry or her hair or--

02:29:42.097 --> 02:29:43.945
TRAVIS: She might be practicing for the Nine Eyes.

02:29:43.945 --> 02:29:46.423
MATT: Or, like many other powerful mages,

02:29:46.423 --> 02:29:47.888
hidden with a glamor.

02:29:47.888 --> 02:29:49.787
MARISHA: What if that's what they meant?

02:29:49.787 --> 02:29:50.893
What if that's what he meant?

02:29:50.893 --> 02:29:52.363
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at
the one at the back of the neck,

02:29:52.363 --> 02:29:53.868
is it just underneath the hair?

02:29:53.868 --> 02:29:56.256
The hair hasn't been removed?

02:29:56.256 --> 02:29:57.456
MATT: The hair hasn't been removed.

02:29:57.456 --> 02:30:00.485
The hair has grown through it.

02:30:00.485 --> 02:30:01.603
SAM: The hair has grown through it,

02:30:01.603 --> 02:30:03.393
so these have been there for a while.

02:30:03.393 --> 02:30:04.763
These aren't what killed her.

02:30:04.763 --> 02:30:06.635
MARISHA: What if they're the alphas?

02:30:06.635 --> 02:30:09.024
What if that's what they meant by alpha to alpha?

02:30:09.024 --> 02:30:11.123
LAURA: To alpha.

02:30:11.123 --> 02:30:14.013
SAM: No conspiracy theories right now!

02:30:14.013 --> 02:30:16.263
MARISHA: That's all this is!
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Detect Magic on the room.

02:30:16.263 --> 02:30:17.743
TRAVIS: Someone's covering up the body, yes?

02:30:17.743 --> 02:30:18.853
I'm sure-
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, rewind.

02:30:18.853 --> 02:30:22.743
Did I find anything in the room dropped by her, by them,

02:30:22.743 --> 02:30:24.710
anything that belonged to her, anything?

02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:29.551
MATT: You find all manner of books that are history books.

02:30:29.551 --> 02:30:33.513
A lot of them deal with survival techniques,

02:30:33.513 --> 02:30:34.943
some of them are classic books

02:30:34.943 --> 02:30:39.623
that you see in a lot of Zemnian libraries

02:30:39.623 --> 02:30:44.096
and other regions, designed to just to pass the time.

02:30:45.963 --> 02:30:47.123
It looks like most everything

02:30:47.123 --> 02:30:48.553
that she brought with her has been taken.

02:30:48.553 --> 02:30:50.613
LIAM: They take her personal spellbook?

02:30:50.613 --> 02:30:51.683
MATT: Yes, everything,

02:30:51.683 --> 02:30:54.986
everything on her except for her clothing, has been taken.

02:30:56.593 --> 02:30:59.523
LAURA: I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on Fjord.

02:30:59.523 --> 02:31:02.338
MATT: Okay, as you--
TRAVIS: Cover the body, cover the body,

02:31:02.338 --> 02:31:03.733
cover the body, cover the body.

02:31:03.733 --> 02:31:05.290
MATT: As you guys are outside of
the chamber, making your way

02:31:05.290 --> 02:31:07.393
around the stairs, you can hear the dozens and dozens

02:31:07.393 --> 02:31:09.204
of heavy footfalls beginning to work

02:31:09.204 --> 02:31:11.601
with haste up the hallway towards you.

02:31:11.601 --> 02:31:12.958
And that's where we're going to take a break.

02:31:12.958 --> 02:31:14.183
(groaning)

02:31:14.183 --> 02:31:15.833
MATT: Because you've been going for a bit.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:31:15.833 --> 02:31:16.673
MATT: We're going to take a break,

02:31:16.673 --> 02:31:20.793
and we'll come back to that, and see what transpires.

02:31:20.793 --> 02:31:23.435
MARISHA: What? Oh, no.
LIAM: I got to cast the tower.

02:31:23.435 --> 02:31:25.303
TRAVIS: God, we suck at our job.

02:31:25.303 --> 02:31:28.333
We're like, fancy dinner, we pay for shit,

02:31:28.333 --> 02:31:29.473
have a couple of drinks.

02:31:29.473 --> 02:31:31.494
Go to bed, we'll you see in the morning, right?

02:31:31.494 --> 02:31:33.995
Barren winter wasteland.

02:31:33.995 --> 02:31:35.293
Didn't even talk about it.

02:31:35.293 --> 02:31:37.763
We didn't set up a sentry outside of her door.

02:31:37.763 --> 02:31:39.613
SAM: We're her bodyguards.
TRAVIS: We didn't do shit.

02:31:39.613 --> 02:31:41.683
We didn't check her room.

02:31:41.683 --> 02:31:43.883
God, we had a chance to be the secret service

02:31:43.883 --> 02:31:44.886
and we blew it!

02:31:46.507 --> 02:31:48.488
ASHLEY: Ugh!
SAM: Well.

02:31:48.488 --> 02:31:49.643
MARISHA: I'm just mad that we were like, "Ah!"

02:31:49.643 --> 02:31:51.583
SAM: It would've helped if we'd
cared about the person we were---

02:31:51.583 --> 02:31:52.963
MARISHA: "Clearly he took her book."
LIAM: Yeah.

02:31:52.963 --> 02:31:54.123
MARISHA: "So it's about the book."

02:31:54.123 --> 02:31:56.170
He's like, "Oh, we got the book back."

02:31:57.503 --> 02:32:01.103
Didn't go one step further to be like he got it <i>from her</i>.

02:32:01.103 --> 02:32:04.023
SAM: Tonight.
MARISHA: Tonight, right now, upstairs.

02:32:04.023 --> 02:32:05.764
TRAVIS: Our Yelp reviews are gonna suck.

02:32:05.764 --> 02:32:07.303
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:32:07.303 --> 02:32:09.013
MATT: And on that note, we'll be back here in a few minutes.

02:32:09.013 --> 02:32:10.113
We'll see you shortly.

02:32:12.397 --> 02:32:14.407
Well, we have a lot to talk about

02:32:14.407 --> 02:32:16.094
in regards to--

02:32:17.147 --> 02:32:17.980
What was that?

02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:19.837
That was not your shot of tequila, was it Sam?

02:32:19.837 --> 02:32:21.591
No, that was just some trash I was throwing out.

02:32:21.591 --> 02:32:22.424
There's a trash can over there.

02:32:22.424 --> 02:32:23.517
Oh okay, I thought you were doing

02:32:23.517 --> 02:32:25.817
the "Fear of Loathing", this is my last drink.

02:32:26.977 --> 02:32:29.590
Hey, cheers, Travis, what you got there?

02:32:30.577 --> 02:32:32.567
This is just a little apple juice.

02:32:32.567 --> 02:32:33.930
14 year old apple juice.

02:32:36.527 --> 02:32:38.767
Sam, what do you have there?

02:32:38.767 --> 02:32:40.250
I have apple juice.

02:32:41.837 --> 02:32:42.677
All right.

02:32:42.677 --> 02:32:43.637
Is it really apple juice?

02:32:43.637 --> 02:32:45.777
I think we're allowed to say

02:32:45.777 --> 02:32:48.393
that we're drinking alcohol, can't we?

02:32:48.393 --> 02:32:49.607
No, I don't think so.

02:32:49.607 --> 02:32:51.887
It's a new policy on the channel.

02:32:51.887 --> 02:32:53.677
There's no alcohol allowed on the channel

02:32:53.677 --> 02:32:55.530
or any adult themes.

02:32:56.907 --> 02:32:57.740
Or language, right?

02:32:57.740 --> 02:33:02.085
That is all the time we have for tonight, folks.

02:33:02.085 --> 02:33:05.730
That's a series wrap on "Talks Machina".

02:33:09.037 --> 02:33:10.237
I think we need to reincorporate

02:33:10.237 --> 02:33:12.482
ice giants and frost giants into the lore

02:33:12.482 --> 02:33:14.077
of the North Pole.

02:33:14.077 --> 02:33:17.107
Well, everyone knows that the North Pole

02:33:17.107 --> 02:33:20.017
is guarded by a family of frost giants.

02:33:20.017 --> 02:33:21.937
And originally, before reindeer,

02:33:21.937 --> 02:33:24.397
Santa Claus' sled was pulled by yetis.

02:33:24.397 --> 02:33:26.177
Does not everybody know that?

02:33:26.177 --> 02:33:27.887
See, I want that movie.

02:33:27.887 --> 02:33:29.037
I want to see,

02:33:29.037 --> 02:33:31.127
it be like, oh, Santa and his elves,

02:33:31.127 --> 02:33:32.577
every single gift in the world,

02:33:32.577 --> 02:33:34.097
think of all the eBay we can make.

02:33:34.097 --> 02:33:34.930
We're just gonna go ahead

02:33:34.930 --> 02:33:37.357
and do the greatest heist of old Saint Nick,

02:33:37.357 --> 02:33:39.457
and they get there and it's just this giant,

02:33:39.457 --> 02:33:40.417
sitting there, armored up,

02:33:40.417 --> 02:33:43.380
going, Mr. Claus didn't invite you.

02:33:45.059 --> 02:33:47.642
(upbeat music)

02:34:04.597 --> 02:34:06.797
Laura: Hey, critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:34:06.797 --> 02:34:09.190
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:34:11.257 --> 02:34:14.090
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:34:17.082 --> 02:34:20.030
Go ahead, darling, treat yourself.

02:34:23.381 --> 02:34:26.048
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

02:34:29.527 --> 02:34:31.087
I mean, the traveler always says,

02:34:31.087 --> 02:34:33.080
impulse purchases are a good decision.

02:34:35.492 --> 02:34:38.257
You're only like five clicks away from owning this,

02:34:38.257 --> 02:34:40.807
maybe more if you have a lot of windows open

02:34:40.807 --> 02:34:42.807
on your browser, I don't know your life.

02:34:44.267 --> 02:34:46.510
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:34:47.447 --> 02:34:49.227
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:34:49.227 --> 02:34:50.230
You still got time.

02:34:54.172 --> 02:34:56.922
(dramatic music)

02:35:01.184 --> 02:35:03.690
I just want to watch my "Critical Role".

02:35:04.877 --> 02:35:06.789
For your consideration,

02:35:06.789 --> 02:35:08.387
this is the face of a critter

02:35:08.387 --> 02:35:11.097
who's craving their "Critical Role" content.

02:35:11.097 --> 02:35:13.167
But for this sanctimonious shipper,

02:35:13.167 --> 02:35:16.057
time misled them like a trip to the Feywild.

02:35:16.057 --> 02:35:17.337
They now have come face to face

02:35:17.337 --> 02:35:19.297
with existential dread.

02:35:19.297 --> 02:35:22.567
A fear of sardonic spoilers.

02:35:22.567 --> 02:35:24.077
Let us led them across the bridge

02:35:24.077 --> 02:35:25.667
into a realm of bright shadows

02:35:25.667 --> 02:35:28.167
where even if one misses the live viewing

02:35:28.167 --> 02:35:29.917
of their favorite program,

02:35:29.917 --> 02:35:31.777
they can still watch it on demand,

02:35:31.777 --> 02:35:33.987
if they bare the mark of a Twitch subscription

02:35:33.987 --> 02:35:35.407
to the channel.

02:35:35.407 --> 02:35:38.167
That mark, a mysterious sigil of emoticons

02:35:38.167 --> 02:35:41.308
made by the sage, Arsequeef.

02:35:41.308 --> 02:35:43.127
In this land of shadow,

02:35:43.127 --> 02:35:45.377
known as the Twitch subscription zone,

02:35:45.377 --> 02:35:47.257
no shipper, fanficker,

02:35:47.257 --> 02:35:49.037
or please name my kitten litter critter,

02:35:49.037 --> 02:35:51.613
has to feel like a bitter fritter.

02:35:51.613 --> 02:35:54.482
And so ends another meandering digression.

02:35:54.482 --> 02:35:57.047
A complicated parody promo

02:35:57.047 --> 02:35:58.377
down an indistinct highway

02:35:58.377 --> 02:36:03.377
to the region we call the Twitch subscription zone.

02:36:05.167 --> 02:36:06.690
Subscribe.

02:36:08.197 --> 02:36:11.017
Twitch Prime subscribe.

02:36:11.017 --> 02:36:12.470
Gift subscribe.

02:36:14.466 --> 02:36:16.280
Subscribe.

02:36:21.202 --> 02:36:24.000
You should check to see if you've left the oven on.

02:49:16.901 --> 02:49:18.361
MATT: And welcome back.

02:49:18.324 --> 02:49:22.274
So picking up where we left off,

02:49:22.274 --> 02:49:24.674
most of the Mighty Nein is currently scrambling

02:49:25.584 --> 02:49:29.394
through the middle of Lady Vess DeRogna's chambers,

02:49:29.394 --> 02:49:33.284
the third floor of Balenpost's main fortress.

02:49:33.284 --> 02:49:38.244
While you, Jester and Fjord, make your way out to the stairs

02:49:38.244 --> 02:49:42.674
to meet with the cadre of soldiers that are being summoned

02:49:42.674 --> 02:49:47.494
at your behest after acquiring the attention of Akron.

02:49:47.494 --> 02:49:50.984
So what do you do as you begin to hear the footfalls rise

02:49:50.984 --> 02:49:52.536
up around the switchback staircase?

02:49:52.536 --> 02:49:53.682
You have a few seconds.
TRAVIS: After a little talk

02:49:53.682 --> 02:49:56.274
over the break, I'm going to drop Mask of Many Faces

02:49:56.274 --> 02:49:57.944
and I'm going to use Major Image

02:49:57.944 --> 02:50:01.114
to summon a Vess DeRogna behind the two of us

02:50:01.114 --> 02:50:02.855
at the top of the stairs--
LIAM: Atta boy.

02:50:02.855 --> 02:50:04.834
TRAVIS: -- at the foot of the open door.

02:50:04.834 --> 02:50:06.654
And we will stand in front of her.

02:50:06.654 --> 02:50:07.644
MATT: Okay, got it.

02:50:07.644 --> 02:50:09.514
So you summon her.

02:50:09.514 --> 02:50:10.771
The illusion appears behind you,

02:50:10.771 --> 02:50:13.454
and there she is in all of her illusory glory,

02:50:13.454 --> 02:50:15.114
hands crossed in front of her,

02:50:15.114 --> 02:50:17.564
chin slightly lifted, just as you recall many

02:50:17.564 --> 02:50:19.794
of the scenarios.

02:50:19.794 --> 02:50:20.637
At that point,

02:50:22.004 --> 02:50:25.604
you see a bunch of soldiers, weapons out at the ready,

02:50:25.604 --> 02:50:27.154
come around the way,

02:50:27.154 --> 02:50:32.154
their piecemeal armor now lit by the torchlight

02:50:32.244 --> 02:50:33.088
into the edges of it.

02:50:33.088 --> 02:50:36.177
They stop and see this and look back, confused.

02:50:36.177 --> 02:50:37.874
LAURA: I'm going to look like we just got reprimanded,

02:50:37.874 --> 02:50:40.173
like really bad.

02:50:40.173 --> 02:50:41.281
MATT: Okay.

02:50:42.904 --> 02:50:45.484
As the tension settles into the chamber,

02:50:45.484 --> 02:50:47.484
Akron pushes around and goes,

02:50:49.311 --> 02:50:52.474
"I'm sorry, was there an issue, Lady?"

02:50:52.474 --> 02:50:53.444
TRAVIS: There was.

02:50:53.444 --> 02:50:57.674
Unfortunately, it seems Lady DeRogna was made

02:50:57.674 --> 02:50:59.504
quite ill last night,

02:50:59.504 --> 02:51:02.544
perhaps by the cooking of this establishment,

02:51:02.544 --> 02:51:04.334
and while she seemed to cry out this morning,

02:51:04.334 --> 02:51:09.334
and was left unheard, your men did not answer her call.

02:51:11.194 --> 02:51:13.224
If you don't mind,

02:51:13.224 --> 02:51:15.624
the Mighty Nein will now take over all food prep,

02:51:15.624 --> 02:51:18.924
all delivery, and all handling of Lady DeRogna's security.

02:51:18.924 --> 02:51:20.309
Is that clear?

02:51:20.309 --> 02:51:21.995
MATT: Make a bluff check.

02:51:21.995 --> 02:51:23.303
LAURA: With advantage!

02:51:23.303 --> 02:51:25.261
SAM: Oy oy oy oy oy!

02:51:26.819 --> 02:51:27.652
TRAVIS: 12.

02:51:27.652 --> 02:51:29.199
LIAM: Come on, face man.

02:51:29.199 --> 02:51:32.323
TRAVIS: 18 plus 10 is 28.

02:51:32.323 --> 02:51:34.244
MATT: 28.

02:51:34.244 --> 02:51:36.476
So as Akron goes,

02:51:36.476 --> 02:51:40.604
"Is this true, Lady DeRogna?"

02:51:40.604 --> 02:51:43.245
TRAVIS: She holds her stomach and she says,

02:51:43.245 --> 02:51:47.034
"Yes, I'm afraid so. The food.

02:51:47.034 --> 02:51:50.094
"I'm not sure, but it's very distressing

02:51:50.094 --> 02:51:51.557
"to cry out and not be heard.

02:51:52.784 --> 02:51:56.125
"I'm very, very disappointed."

02:51:56.125 --> 02:51:58.594
(laughter)

02:51:58.594 --> 02:52:01.685
MATT: But, I'm sure, in her accent.
TRAVIS: Yeah. The French accent.

02:52:01.685 --> 02:52:03.436
SAM: (exaggerated French accent) I am very disappointed.

02:52:03.436 --> 02:52:06.077
LIAM: (exaggerated French accent) How you say--

02:52:06.077 --> 02:52:07.768
TRAVIS: (exaggerated French accent) Be our guest.
ASHLEY: How you say, ah--

02:52:07.768 --> 02:52:08.601
MATT: Akron goes,

02:52:10.174 --> 02:52:15.174
"My sincerest apologies, Lady DeRogna.

02:52:15.205 --> 02:52:19.664
"We have been doing what <i>I thought was our best</i>

02:52:19.664 --> 02:52:22.494
"to provide an experience,

02:52:22.494 --> 02:52:25.114
"only befit a member of the Assembly.

02:52:25.114 --> 02:52:26.514
"The individuals responsible

02:52:26.514 --> 02:52:29.854
"for your meal prep will be punished severely.

02:52:29.854 --> 02:52:32.724
"And as per the request,

02:52:32.724 --> 02:52:34.815
"indeed, your...

02:52:35.657 --> 02:52:38.984
"guardians will be able to receive

02:52:38.984 --> 02:52:41.154
"and be tasked with the preparation

02:52:41.154 --> 02:52:45.474
"and care of your meals from this point forward."

02:52:45.474 --> 02:52:47.694
TRAVIS: She says, "Thank you.

02:52:47.694 --> 02:52:51.774
"These truly are capable warriors.

02:52:51.774 --> 02:52:52.745
"If you don't mind,

02:52:52.745 --> 02:52:56.065
"I'm still feeling a bit under the weather.

02:52:56.065 --> 02:52:58.894
"We'll have to resume our activities on the morrow,

02:52:58.894 --> 02:53:00.846
"if that's all right." (laughs)

02:53:00.846 --> 02:53:03.148
(laughter)

02:53:03.148 --> 02:53:06.101
TRAVIS: She's not laughing!

02:53:06.101 --> 02:53:08.561
"I have to retire to rest."

02:53:10.503 --> 02:53:15.470
MATT: "Should I inform Dagen of your--?"

02:53:16.554 --> 02:53:18.584
TRAVIS: I turn, Fjord turns and says:

02:53:18.584 --> 02:53:21.364
We will make sure that Dagen is informed.

02:53:21.364 --> 02:53:24.154
Again, all of the Lady's communications will run

02:53:24.154 --> 02:53:25.974
through us as well.

02:53:25.974 --> 02:53:27.687
MATT: "Understood.

02:53:27.687 --> 02:53:31.214
"Once again, my sincerest apologies,"

02:53:31.214 --> 02:53:35.374
and he turns around to the soldiers behind them

02:53:35.374 --> 02:53:38.264
and you watch them all take a step back.

02:53:38.264 --> 02:53:39.297
LAURA: Shut the door.

02:53:39.297 --> 02:53:40.964
MATT: Okay, as you close the door,

02:53:40.964 --> 02:53:43.301
you begin to hear just shouting like,

02:53:43.301 --> 02:53:45.621
"You imbecile! Come here, come here!"

02:53:45.621 --> 02:53:48.364
And you hear some shuffling. People begin

02:53:48.364 --> 02:53:50.454
to scatter a bit, the downstairs area,

02:53:50.454 --> 02:53:53.234
the common soldier barracks,

02:53:53.234 --> 02:53:56.054
a chamber that crosses by the staircase.

02:53:56.054 --> 02:53:58.254
You can hear soldiers quickly shuffling

02:53:58.254 --> 02:54:00.164
in there to get out of the scuffle.

02:54:00.164 --> 02:54:01.954
And you hear the raised voices continue

02:54:01.954 --> 02:54:03.104
as they beginning to descend

02:54:03.104 --> 02:54:04.824
lower and lower within the fort.

02:54:04.824 --> 02:54:06.354
And then within a period of time you feel like,

02:54:06.354 --> 02:54:08.527
at the moment, their eyes are not on you.

02:54:10.392 --> 02:54:11.416
LAURA: Good job.

02:54:11.416 --> 02:54:12.374
SAM: (exhales)
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:54:12.374 --> 02:54:14.604
LAURA: You made her really nice.

02:54:14.604 --> 02:54:16.464
I'm sure they were really unnerved

02:54:16.464 --> 02:54:18.004
by the fact that she was nice.

02:54:18.004 --> 02:54:19.614
TRAVIS: I feel really bad for the kitchen staff.

02:54:19.614 --> 02:54:22.164
Okay, I don't know how much time we have,

02:54:22.164 --> 02:54:24.724
but perhaps we should execute whatever next step

02:54:24.724 --> 02:54:25.747
of the plan we have.

02:54:27.684 --> 02:54:29.434
ASHLEY: Can I look around and see if there's any

02:54:30.726 --> 02:54:32.662
sign of struggle, anything?

02:54:32.662 --> 02:54:34.792
Just look around and see if there's anything else

02:54:34.792 --> 02:54:37.014
that we might be missing in the room.

02:54:37.014 --> 02:54:38.362
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:54:38.362 --> 02:54:39.674
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:54:39.674 --> 02:54:42.338
TALIESIN: Also, yeah I did around the--

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:44.317
TRAVIS: That advantage helped massively.

02:54:44.317 --> 02:54:45.434
ASHLEY: 12.

02:54:45.434 --> 02:54:48.993
MATT: 12. I mean, best you can tell,

02:54:48.993 --> 02:54:51.259
the bed where the body still lays,

02:54:51.259 --> 02:54:53.694
there is blood pooling from the places

02:54:53.694 --> 02:54:58.527
where it has leaked from the head orifices

02:54:58.527 --> 02:55:01.584
onto the bed. And then on the ground at the foot of it,

02:55:01.584 --> 02:55:04.292
you can see there are fresh splatter,

02:55:04.292 --> 02:55:05.814
or fresh in comparison--

02:55:05.814 --> 02:55:09.444
they're as fresh as the body is-- splatters of blood

02:55:09.444 --> 02:55:12.284
at the foot of the bed, on the ground

02:55:12.284 --> 02:55:14.894
that is frozen over.

02:55:14.894 --> 02:55:16.373
LAURA: Should we find out what happened, Caduceus?

02:55:16.373 --> 02:55:18.705
SAM: Those splatters on the foot of the bed,

02:55:18.705 --> 02:55:21.688
do they look like they're dripping

02:55:21.688 --> 02:55:23.624
from her toes or something, or is it--?

02:55:23.624 --> 02:55:26.364
MATT: No, and even just passive investigation

02:55:26.364 --> 02:55:29.224
between Caleb and Veth and Beauregard,

02:55:29.224 --> 02:55:30.954
it's relatively easy for you guys to ascertain

02:55:30.954 --> 02:55:33.528
that she died on her feet.

02:55:33.528 --> 02:55:35.254
SAM: And fell backwards or was placed?
MATT: And then fell backwards.

02:55:35.254 --> 02:55:36.087
SAM: Okay.

02:55:36.087 --> 02:55:39.600
MATT: So whatever took her took her violently and suddenly.

02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:41.774
MARISHA: Jesus.
SAM: Cool.

02:55:41.774 --> 02:55:45.124
LIAM: By now the door to the tower is back,

02:55:45.124 --> 02:55:47.334
because I would have used the time they were talking--

02:55:47.334 --> 02:55:48.854
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: -- to cast.

02:55:48.854 --> 02:55:50.144
SAM: But wait, what are we doing?

02:55:50.144 --> 02:55:52.644
LIAM: Well, we have the body

02:55:52.644 --> 02:55:55.184
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand here right now.

02:55:55.184 --> 02:55:57.034
We don't want to kick off a whole new war.

02:55:57.034 --> 02:55:59.204
TRAVIS: Huh?
TALIESIN: We also have five questions.

02:55:59.204 --> 02:56:03.594
LIAM: Let's drag her inside and the door here will vanish.

02:56:03.594 --> 02:56:04.854
They won't know where we are,

02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:08.409
and we will have 24 hours max if we want

02:56:08.409 --> 02:56:09.834
to figure this shit out.

02:56:09.834 --> 02:56:13.154
TRAVIS: I can stay in this room, outside of the tower,

02:56:13.154 --> 02:56:15.794
in case someone knocks or asks or checks,

02:56:15.794 --> 02:56:17.294
I can answer the door.

02:56:17.294 --> 02:56:18.744
SAM: Does anyone have any magical means

02:56:18.744 --> 02:56:22.001
of cleaning up this blood all over the place?

02:56:22.001 --> 02:56:23.044
TRAVIS: And there are no tracks, right?

02:56:23.044 --> 02:56:25.004
Nothing that shows that they entered

02:56:25.004 --> 02:56:26.654
or left through the window or the door?
SAM: There is an open window

02:56:26.654 --> 02:56:28.937
MARISHA: We already know.
SAM: There's snow that we need to get out.

02:56:28.937 --> 02:56:29.770
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

02:56:29.770 --> 02:56:31.358
TRAVIS: And there was no blood going up the side

02:56:31.358 --> 02:56:33.314
of the building to the roof or down

02:56:33.314 --> 02:56:35.764
or they just vanished?

02:56:35.764 --> 02:56:39.104
SAM: I'll pop my head out, Matt, out of the window,

02:56:39.104 --> 02:56:40.839
and just see if there's any tracks or anything.

02:56:40.839 --> 02:56:42.359
LAURA: I watched him jump out the window.
TRAVIS: He did.

02:56:42.359 --> 02:56:44.204
SAM: Or signs of breaking and entering.

02:56:44.204 --> 02:56:45.074
MATT: Certainly.

02:56:45.074 --> 02:56:46.613
TALIESIN: Does no one have Prestidigitation?

02:56:46.613 --> 02:56:48.129
LAURA: No.
SAM: 23.

02:56:48.129 --> 02:56:50.047
TRAVIS: Baby, there's no way you would know.
MATT: 23.

02:56:50.047 --> 02:56:51.434
LAURA: There's always--

02:56:51.434 --> 02:56:52.634
MATT: You do not see any tracks,

02:56:52.634 --> 02:56:56.074
because there's been a full evening and morning

02:56:56.074 --> 02:56:57.604
of consistent snowfall,

02:56:57.604 --> 02:56:59.077
and it is just--
MARISHA: Yeah, we have no idea.

02:56:59.077 --> 02:57:03.964
MATT: Just a consistent, soft, plain of fresh snow

02:57:03.964 --> 02:57:06.164
that has settled.
SAM: And is the window just--

02:57:06.164 --> 02:57:07.604
has it been broken open,

02:57:07.604 --> 02:57:09.457
or is it just left open?

02:57:10.662 --> 02:57:12.370
MATT: If you go ahead and inspect the hinges for it,

02:57:12.370 --> 02:57:14.164
it is currently open,

02:57:14.164 --> 02:57:16.814
and a little bit of ice has gathered at the edges,

02:57:16.814 --> 02:57:19.534
and keeping it sealed open on that side.

02:57:19.534 --> 02:57:21.034
SAM: But like, could I close the window?

02:57:21.034 --> 02:57:22.821
MATT: Yeah, you can close it.
SAM: Okay, I will close the window.

02:57:22.821 --> 02:57:24.869
MATT: It takes you a moment to jostle it free

02:57:24.869 --> 02:57:27.604
from what frost has gathered and kept it.

02:57:27.604 --> 02:57:30.454
SAM: Okay, so yeah, drag the body in and stuff,

02:57:30.454 --> 02:57:33.304
but I feel like a couple of us should clean up the room

02:57:33.304 --> 02:57:36.454
or something, so someone comes in...

02:57:36.454 --> 02:57:37.844
TRAVIS: I can be doing that.

02:57:37.844 --> 02:57:39.406
I'll stay outside as well.

02:57:39.406 --> 02:57:40.239
SAM: Okay.

02:57:42.776 --> 02:57:43.926
MARISHA: Caduceus.

02:57:43.926 --> 02:57:47.717
LIAM: Well, let's get her up to the second floor,

02:57:48.848 --> 02:57:49.764
the grand hall.

02:57:49.764 --> 02:57:53.802
MARISHA: Yeah, let's figure out
exactly what we're going to ask her.

02:57:57.282 --> 02:58:00.164
TALIESIN: I got some ideas, but I'm happy to hear them.

02:58:00.164 --> 02:58:02.096
LIAM: Yasha, will you help me get the body--

02:58:02.096 --> 02:58:03.421
ASHLEY: Yes.
LIAM: -- up to the top of the platform

02:58:03.421 --> 02:58:04.504
and then we can float her up.

02:58:04.504 --> 02:58:05.674
ASHLEY: Just pick her up.

02:58:05.674 --> 02:58:08.024
LIAM: Okay, we float spiraling up together

02:58:08.024 --> 02:58:10.431
with the dead Cerberus Assembly wizard

02:58:10.431 --> 02:58:11.964
up to the second floor?

02:58:11.964 --> 02:58:12.797
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:58:12.797 --> 02:58:16.154
LIAM: And we lay her down.

02:58:16.154 --> 02:58:20.204
I run over to the double doors and open it,

02:58:20.204 --> 02:58:22.194
and pull out a rolling table,

02:58:22.194 --> 02:58:24.694
and we lay her down on top of that,

02:58:24.694 --> 02:58:27.597
and wait for everyone who's going to convene to convene.

02:58:29.164 --> 02:58:31.484
So we've got a morgue slab, more or less.

02:58:31.484 --> 02:58:32.317
MATT: Okay.

02:58:34.904 --> 02:58:37.557
TALIESIN: She's in stasis until we decide otherwise.

02:58:38.544 --> 02:58:40.204
MARISHA: I mean, we have a chance here

02:58:40.204 --> 02:58:44.614
where she might be more honest with us dead.

02:58:44.614 --> 02:58:47.584
TALIESIN: Yeah, and she'll remember what happened.

02:58:47.584 --> 02:58:52.584
MARISHA: We also have almost more of a bargain.

02:58:52.724 --> 02:58:55.366
What else does she have to lose now, right?

02:58:56.634 --> 02:58:58.344
It's clear she was dishonest with us.

02:58:58.344 --> 02:59:00.259
She was withholding information.

02:59:01.694 --> 02:59:05.254
LAURA: Well, what if she was like Molly is?

02:59:05.254 --> 02:59:08.695
I mean, what if she's--

02:59:08.695 --> 02:59:12.545
when she's gone, she's gone.

02:59:14.536 --> 02:59:16.964
That another person would be coming back.

02:59:16.964 --> 02:59:21.264
What if the Nine Eyes is somehow--
MARISHA: Nine...

02:59:21.264 --> 02:59:24.397
people. Nine entities, nine lives.

02:59:24.397 --> 02:59:26.414
LIAM: Yeah, does anyone associated

02:59:26.414 --> 02:59:29.936
with this Eyes of Nine have the same,

02:59:29.936 --> 02:59:32.314
multiple personalities locked away

02:59:32.314 --> 02:59:34.114
or is that just a Mollymauk thing?

02:59:34.114 --> 02:59:36.164
MARISHA: Well, I guess all those questions

02:59:36.164 --> 02:59:37.154
we had for Mollymauk

02:59:37.154 --> 02:59:39.474
we're about to find out.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:59:39.474 --> 02:59:43.874
Perhaps she will be more forthright with us

02:59:43.874 --> 02:59:47.564
if she believes we will bring her back in exchange.

02:59:47.564 --> 02:59:48.930
MARISHA: Exactly.

02:59:50.755 --> 02:59:52.972
That's a great bargaining chip.

02:59:54.474 --> 02:59:55.307
TALIESIN: Or...

02:59:56.682 --> 02:59:57.523
she's clever.

02:59:57.523 --> 03:00:02.519
Will she insist on only talking once we bring her back?

03:00:04.804 --> 03:00:07.157
MARISHA: Well, if she is like Molly, then, I guess,

03:00:08.614 --> 03:00:11.294
maybe what we can offer isn't as valuable.

03:00:11.294 --> 03:00:13.047
TALIESIN: I say we start with a conversation

03:00:13.047 --> 03:00:15.983
and then use the carrot if it seems necessary.

03:00:15.983 --> 03:00:19.054
MATT: To be aware, because you would be aware of this.

03:00:19.054 --> 03:00:21.154
Speak with Dead does not speak with the soul.

03:00:21.154 --> 03:00:21.987
TALIESIN: No, it's not.

03:00:21.987 --> 03:00:23.552
MATT: It's the animated spirit of the body

03:00:23.552 --> 03:00:25.274
and what it knew in life, so.

03:00:25.274 --> 03:00:28.052
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's no, they're not that bright.

03:00:28.052 --> 03:00:28.885
MATT: No.

03:00:31.604 --> 03:00:33.720
TALIESIN: It's just--

03:00:33.720 --> 03:00:35.395
they'll remember how they died, though.

03:00:35.395 --> 03:00:37.314
Everything up until then is clear.

03:00:37.314 --> 03:00:38.807
MATT: It remembers everything the body experienced.

03:00:38.807 --> 03:00:39.732
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:00:41.107 --> 03:00:42.744
LIAM: I will--

03:00:42.744 --> 03:00:44.544
I can do this telepathically,

03:00:44.544 --> 03:00:45.864
make the globules

03:00:45.864 --> 03:00:50.864
that ring this entire nine-sided large hall brighten or dim.

03:00:50.904 --> 03:00:52.344
So they all go as bright as they can

03:00:52.344 --> 03:00:55.394
and I pull a rope on one wall

03:00:55.394 --> 03:00:58.444
and a stream of cats comes in the holes in the bottom

03:00:58.444 --> 03:01:01.624
and forms a large ring around this table

03:01:01.624 --> 03:01:04.494
and the cats begin to glow slightly as well.

03:01:04.494 --> 03:01:07.014
So there is--
MARISHA: It's a bit unnerving.

03:01:07.014 --> 03:01:09.067
LIAM: It's a bit like a medical amphitheater now.

03:01:09.067 --> 03:01:11.184
MARISHA: Ah.
SAM: Cool.

03:01:11.184 --> 03:01:12.194
TRAVIS: Whoa.
LAURA: I like them.

03:01:12.194 --> 03:01:14.076
MARISHA: Are these cats happy?

03:01:14.076 --> 03:01:15.604
(laughter)

03:01:15.604 --> 03:01:17.414
LAURA: They purr.

03:01:17.414 --> 03:01:19.434
LIAM: Well, they've only been in existence

03:01:19.434 --> 03:01:22.494
for a slightly under 48 hours,

03:01:22.494 --> 03:01:25.369
so they might not be sure themselves yet.

03:01:25.369 --> 03:01:27.041
MARISHA: Mmm.
TRAVIS: What is the meaning of-- (blows raspberry)

03:01:27.041 --> 03:01:30.384
LIAM: Are you happy?
MARISHA: Dude, oh.

03:01:30.384 --> 03:01:31.862
LIAM: Yeah, it's a big question, isn't it?

03:01:31.862 --> 03:01:34.204
MARISHA: Yeah, but a cat?
TALIESIN: It's a big question

03:01:34.204 --> 03:01:36.929
to pose to a cat, I think as well.

03:01:36.929 --> 03:01:38.874
MARISHA: Should we pose it to a dead person?

03:01:38.874 --> 03:01:39.844
TALIESIN: I think we will.

03:01:39.844 --> 03:01:41.817
That's actually--
MARISHA: Let's get back to that.

03:01:43.994 --> 03:01:45.784
TALIESIN: Do we have-- let's sit her upright.

03:01:45.784 --> 03:01:47.424
Let's make this a conversation.

03:01:47.424 --> 03:01:50.014
MARISHA: Okay, okay, what are we asking, though?

03:01:50.014 --> 03:01:52.004
TALIESIN: Well, I've been thinking about that.

03:01:52.004 --> 03:01:54.254
MARISHA: Let's not ask her anything we already know.

03:01:55.424 --> 03:01:57.277
TALIESIN: We know that she has the tattoos,

03:01:57.277 --> 03:01:59.135
so we could ask what they mean.

03:02:01.327 --> 03:02:02.744
What the book is,

03:02:07.096 --> 03:02:09.211
where she thinks he's headed,

03:02:10.624 --> 03:02:14.364
and what "To alpha and alpha.

03:02:14.364 --> 03:02:17.625
"We trek 'til homeward bound, we be," might mean.

03:02:18.954 --> 03:02:21.787
MARISHA: And then there's one more question.

03:02:21.787 --> 03:02:24.048
TALIESIN: Yeah,.
TRAVIS: What?

03:02:24.048 --> 03:02:26.637
ASHLEY: Be beneficial, I want to ask her who are the--

03:02:27.864 --> 03:02:29.854
who is-- who are the the Nine Eyes?

03:02:29.854 --> 03:02:32.114
MARISHA: Yeah, what does this all mean?

03:02:32.114 --> 03:02:33.944
LIAM: Yeah, what is it you haven't been telling us?

03:02:33.944 --> 03:02:35.114
MARISHA: What are the Eyes of Nine?

03:02:35.114 --> 03:02:36.464
Yeah, right, yeah.

03:02:39.719 --> 03:02:41.784
LAURA: It's a big question.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:02:41.784 --> 03:02:42.750
LIAM: It is.

03:02:45.384 --> 03:02:48.134
SAM: Me and Fjord are going to finish up our cleaning--

03:02:48.134 --> 03:02:49.401
MATT: Okay.
SAM: -- and come in.

03:02:50.646 --> 03:02:51.754
TRAVIS: I stay out.

03:02:51.754 --> 03:02:54.562
SAM: You're going to stay out?
TRAVIS: In case someone knocks on the door.

03:02:54.562 --> 03:02:56.687
SAM: Do you want me to stay with you or are you okay?

03:02:56.687 --> 03:02:58.074
TRAVIS: I'll be all right.
LIAM: You're in ear shot.

03:02:58.074 --> 03:02:59.894
You can call out.
TRAVIS: You can send a message, too.

03:02:59.894 --> 03:03:01.603
LIAM: We could shout to you from where we are.

03:03:01.603 --> 03:03:03.120
TRAVIS: Oh, and I can hear it from within the--

03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:03.954
SAM: I don't think so.

03:03:03.954 --> 03:03:05.227
LAURA: We can have the door open.
LIAM: I can leave the door open.

03:03:05.227 --> 03:03:06.060
SAM: Oh cool.

03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:08.905
TRAVIS: Wow, that's awesome. Even better.

03:03:08.905 --> 03:03:10.328
If shit goes down, I'll close it.

03:03:10.328 --> 03:03:12.779
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to drop the hold

03:03:12.779 --> 03:03:16.827
to drop the stasis on the body.

03:03:19.454 --> 03:03:21.844
Just out of panic, Eyes of the Grave.

03:03:23.422 --> 03:03:25.526
It's just a cadaver?

03:03:25.526 --> 03:03:27.714
MATT: It's just a cadaver.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:03:27.714 --> 03:03:29.954
TRAVIS: Ooh, what else would it have been?

03:03:29.954 --> 03:03:30.787
LAURA: The undead.

03:03:30.787 --> 03:03:32.664
TALIESIN: Trap, undead, like they're, you know.

03:03:32.664 --> 03:03:34.169
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure, wow.

03:03:36.384 --> 03:03:37.834
TALIESIN: Things are weird right now.

03:03:38.814 --> 03:03:41.754
And then I'm casting Speak with Dead.

03:03:41.754 --> 03:03:45.469
MATT: Very well, so--
TRAVIS: Let's go, immortal one.

03:03:45.469 --> 03:03:49.019
MARISHA: Come on, come on.
MATT: As you take a moment to

03:03:49.019 --> 03:03:51.519
beseech mentally the Wild Mother

03:03:51.519 --> 03:03:55.954
to breathe her breath of life

03:03:55.954 --> 03:03:59.920
into this no longer living corpse,

03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:02.814
you deeply inhale,

03:04:02.814 --> 03:04:07.814
and then as you exhale your breath across the corpse

03:04:07.834 --> 03:04:09.294
of Lady Vess DeRogna,

03:04:09.294 --> 03:04:11.224
you watch her chest inhale,

03:04:11.224 --> 03:04:13.904
like it's breathing his breath in.

03:04:13.904 --> 03:04:17.214
Her expression still locked in that terrified,

03:04:17.214 --> 03:04:21.589
twisted ghastly expression of horror and pain,

03:04:21.589 --> 03:04:22.964
eyes wide.

03:04:22.964 --> 03:04:24.824
The jaw still open and locked.

03:04:24.824 --> 03:04:27.523
Just (guttural gasp).

03:04:27.523 --> 03:04:29.331
SAM: (sound of disgust)

03:04:29.331 --> 03:04:30.897
MATT: (crunching gasp)

03:04:30.897 --> 03:04:32.561
And just looks right back towards you,

03:04:32.561 --> 03:04:37.142
her eyes meeting yours, but still looking past you.

03:04:39.571 --> 03:04:42.167
TALIESIN: As I'm sure you know, things did not go well.

03:04:44.271 --> 03:04:48.126
If we're to continue, we're going to need your help.

03:04:50.181 --> 03:04:55.181
(sighs) You have nine red eyes

03:04:57.221 --> 03:04:58.494
tattooed on your body.

03:04:59.951 --> 03:05:01.107
What do they mean?

03:05:02.769 --> 03:05:05.601
MATT: (squelches) The jaw, you can see the tense muscles

03:05:05.601 --> 03:05:08.921
snap it shut for a second, then it begins to speak

03:05:08.921 --> 03:05:11.391
with you, stilted and awkward.

03:05:13.281 --> 03:05:16.021
"They are

03:05:16.021 --> 03:05:18.466
"my connection.

03:05:20.721 --> 03:05:21.679
"They

03:05:22.810 --> 03:05:24.421
"are my

03:05:25.501 --> 03:05:28.621
"right to be

03:05:29.857 --> 03:05:31.199
"the Nonagon."

03:05:35.754 --> 03:05:37.279
LIAM: (exhales)

03:05:40.712 --> 03:05:42.654
TALIESIN: (sighs)

03:05:45.201 --> 03:05:48.828
TALIESIN: What was the book that Lucien took from you?

03:05:52.301 --> 03:05:54.857
MATT: "Something found.

03:05:56.861 --> 03:05:58.191
"Something

03:05:59.411 --> 03:06:02.134
"wasted on those

03:06:04.341 --> 03:06:06.327
"who discovered it,

03:06:09.605 --> 03:06:11.155
"and something

03:06:12.991 --> 03:06:16.624
"I was so close to unlocking."

03:06:20.881 --> 03:06:25.607
TALIESIN: Well, it looks like he's going to beat you to it.

03:06:27.527 --> 03:06:31.221
(sighs) "To alpha and alpha,

03:06:31.221 --> 03:06:33.532
"we trek 'til homeward bound we be."

03:06:36.221 --> 03:06:37.891
What do you think that means?

03:06:40.701 --> 03:06:42.461
MATT: "I am uncertain,

03:06:43.551 --> 03:06:44.534
"though

03:06:46.201 --> 03:06:50.400
"many pieces of the city lay strewn,

03:06:54.669 --> 03:06:56.319
"one to the next."

03:07:04.442 --> 03:07:06.741
TALIESIN: Does anyone have one more, or can I take it?

03:07:06.741 --> 03:07:08.271
SAM: Well, that's three, right?
MARISHA: We reach into--

03:07:08.271 --> 03:07:09.771
TALIESIN: One more.

03:07:09.771 --> 03:07:11.946
MARISHA: Where were they headed?
That was only three.

03:07:11.946 --> 03:07:13.181
SAM: That was only three.

03:07:13.181 --> 03:07:15.431
LAURA: You can ask what it means to be a Nonagon.

03:07:15.431 --> 03:07:16.601
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, it was, like,

03:07:16.601 --> 03:07:18.846
"where were you all headed," but I feel like

03:07:18.846 --> 03:07:19.679
we know that now--
TALIESIN: I think we already

03:07:19.679 --> 03:07:21.226
know that.
MARISHA: --with that question.

03:07:21.226 --> 03:07:24.171
And then it was, like, "what does it all mean," which isn't

03:07:24.171 --> 03:07:28.171
too far off from "what does it mean to be a Nonagon?"

03:07:28.171 --> 03:07:31.801
LIAM: You could ask, "What is it
you haven't been telling us?"

03:07:31.801 --> 03:07:33.510
SAM: All vague.
TALIESIN: That's very vague.

03:07:33.510 --> 03:07:34.573
LAURA: That's vague, yeah.

03:07:34.573 --> 03:07:37.758
"What is a Nonagon?" or "what does it mean to be a Nonagon?"

03:07:38.803 --> 03:07:40.191
(eraser scratching)

03:07:40.191 --> 03:07:42.827
TALIESIN: Lucien also called himself a Nonagon.

03:07:44.461 --> 03:07:46.168
What is it to be a Nonagon?

03:07:48.151 --> 03:07:51.451
MATT: The head twists slightly with a pop

03:07:52.401 --> 03:07:55.984
as it begins to shift and look towards you.

03:07:59.269 --> 03:08:00.736
"A Nonagon

03:08:01.919 --> 03:08:03.235
"is a vessel.

03:08:05.090 --> 03:08:06.073
"It is

03:08:07.988 --> 03:08:11.554
"the key to Cognouza."

03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:13.243
SAM: To what?

03:08:15.338 --> 03:08:17.004
MATT: "It is--"
MARISHA: Cog--

03:08:18.711 --> 03:08:21.991
MATT: "-- the one to free

03:08:21.991 --> 03:08:23.804
"the Somnovem."

03:08:30.279 --> 03:08:32.311
(page flapping)

03:08:32.311 --> 03:08:34.051
TALIESIN: How long ago?

03:08:34.051 --> 03:08:36.686
How long ago did you find Molly?

03:08:39.851 --> 03:08:41.461
LAURA: We met him--

03:08:41.461 --> 03:08:43.516
SAM: Two years ago?
LAURA: No, like a year

03:08:43.516 --> 03:08:44.451
and a half.
TALIESIN: A year-ish, right?

03:08:44.451 --> 03:08:46.444
SAM: Well, when did <i>you</i> meet Molly?

03:08:47.781 --> 03:08:49.528
ASHLEY: I mean--
LIAM: Two years prior, start of the story.

03:08:49.528 --> 03:08:51.491
MATT: It would've been around a little over two years ago.

03:08:51.491 --> 03:08:54.994
ASHLEY: Yeah, I only met him at the-
TALIESIN: All right, over--

03:08:58.250 --> 03:09:00.164
a bit over two years ago,

03:09:01.541 --> 03:09:04.402
something went wrong with Lucien.

03:09:05.281 --> 03:09:06.949
Something he was trying to do

03:09:08.921 --> 03:09:10.131
changed him.

03:09:11.071 --> 03:09:12.621
Do you know what that was?

03:09:13.905 --> 03:09:17.296
MATT: "Yes, I'm the one who did it."

03:09:18.884 --> 03:09:21.145
(exhaling)

03:09:21.145 --> 03:09:22.561
ALL: (groaning)

03:09:22.561 --> 03:09:23.736
ALL: (groaning)
LIAM: I didn't hear what--

03:09:23.736 --> 03:09:26.494
LAURA: "Yes, I'm the one who did it."
TRAVIS: She's the one who did it.

03:09:26.494 --> 03:09:27.896
LAURA: So she-
TRAVIS: Okay, just because

03:09:27.896 --> 03:09:30.311
it was soft, a key to Cognouza?
SAM: Cognouza?

03:09:30.311 --> 03:09:31.502
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Cognouza.

03:09:31.502 --> 03:09:34.277
MARISHA: Ancient, the one to free the what?

03:09:34.277 --> 03:09:37.107
MATT: Somnovem.
TRAVIS: Somnovem?

03:09:37.107 --> 03:09:38.423
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Key to Cognouza.

03:09:38.423 --> 03:09:39.971
TRAVIS: Is that one word, Sognovum?

03:09:39.971 --> 03:09:41.296
MATT: Somnovem.

03:09:41.296 --> 03:09:43.789
MARISHA: S, S-O-M,
MATT: S-O-M.

03:09:43.789 --> 03:09:46.381
MARISHA: N-O-V-E-N?
MATT: N-O-V-E-M.

03:09:46.381 --> 03:09:49.448
MARISHA: V-E-N, N-O-V.
ASHLEY: One word?

03:09:49.448 --> 03:09:51.731
TRAVIS: It's S-O-M-N-O-V-E-M.

03:09:51.731 --> 03:09:55.128
Cognouza is C-O-G-N-O-S-A?

03:09:55.128 --> 03:09:56.569
MATT: N-O-U-Z-A.

03:09:56.569 --> 03:10:00.856
MARISHA: N-O-U-Z-A.
LIAM: Key to Cognouza,

03:10:00.856 --> 03:10:02.147
and the second bit one more time?

03:10:02.147 --> 03:10:04.320
SAM: Somnovem, Somnovem?

03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:05.572
MATT: Somnovem.
MARISHA: Somnoven?

03:10:05.572 --> 03:10:07.739
TRAVIS: S-O-M-N-O-V
MARISHA: With a--

03:10:07.739 --> 03:10:09.189
with an N at the end.
MATT: M.

03:10:09.189 --> 03:10:10.658
MARISHA: An M, a Somnovem.

03:10:10.658 --> 03:10:12.971
TRAVIS: A vessel, a key to Cognouza.
SAM: I mean, som and sleep.

03:10:12.971 --> 03:10:15.221
Nov means nine.

03:10:15.221 --> 03:10:17.591
LAURA: Wow!
TRAVIS: Wait, what?

03:10:17.591 --> 03:10:20.691
SAM: Som, like "somnambulist."
MARISHA: Like "somber"?

03:10:20.691 --> 03:10:22.911
SAM: It means "sleep."
LIAM: "Somnolent," yeah.

03:10:22.911 --> 03:10:26.405
SAM: And then "nov" is nine, right?

03:10:26.405 --> 03:10:29.674
MARISHA: And then Cognouza, cog--
SAM: Or "new."

03:10:29.674 --> 03:10:32.449
Nova means new.
LAURA: "A new sleep"?

03:10:35.781 --> 03:10:36.907
SAM: In Zemnian!

03:10:36.907 --> 03:10:39.687
(laughter)

03:10:39.687 --> 03:10:40.854
MARISHA: Cognouza.

03:10:41.881 --> 03:10:45.811
TALIESIN: Well.
TRAVIS: Holy fucking balls, I'm so glad we did that.

03:10:45.811 --> 03:10:48.669
MARISHA: Yes.
TRAVIS: And Vess DeRogna did that shit to Molly.

03:10:48.669 --> 03:10:51.401
So, she totally, of course, clearly now knew.

03:10:51.401 --> 03:10:54.801
SAM: The key to Cognouza to unlock--?

03:10:54.801 --> 03:10:56.851
LIAM: A lot more than just they were some mercs for hire.

03:10:56.851 --> 03:11:00.037
MARISHA: The one to free Somnovem.

03:11:00.037 --> 03:11:01.481
MATT: "Free the Somnovem."

03:11:01.481 --> 03:11:03.884
LAURA: "Free the Somnovem."

03:11:04.934 --> 03:11:07.137
MARISHA: Nonagon is a vessel, the key

03:11:07.137 --> 03:11:09.842
to Cognouza.
LAURA: (gasps) That's the city!

03:11:09.842 --> 03:11:11.886
That's the city! Somnovem is a city.

03:11:11.886 --> 03:11:14.385
LIAM: Free the Eyes of Nine.
SAM: Do we know what this city is called at all?

03:11:14.385 --> 03:11:15.527
LAURA: That's what it is!

03:11:15.527 --> 03:11:17.587
SAM: No, but have we ever heard a name of the city?

03:11:17.587 --> 03:11:19.791
Is it Aeor?
TALIESIN: Not now.

03:11:19.791 --> 03:11:22.663
TRAVIS: And it wasn't the--
MARISHA: Well, is it Somnovem

03:11:22.663 --> 03:11:24.031
or Cognouza?

03:11:24.031 --> 03:11:27.056
LAURA: The key to Cognouza to free the Som-- I bet.

03:11:27.056 --> 03:11:29.121
SAM: Remember, the Cognouza is the act

03:11:29.121 --> 03:11:32.444
of freeing it, or the-- the ritual--

03:11:32.444 --> 03:11:35.003
LIAM: It could be the city.
It could be inhabitants of the city.

03:11:35.003 --> 03:11:36.894
It's hard to-- hard to know.

03:11:38.473 --> 03:11:40.239
MARISHA: "To free Somnovem."

03:11:41.911 --> 03:11:45.667
LAURA: Whatever it is, I think
it would be bad if we freed it.

03:11:46.571 --> 03:11:49.494
SAM: Or if Lucien does, yeah.

03:11:51.731 --> 03:11:55.721
And <i>she</i> killed Lucien, a.k.a. Molly.

03:11:55.721 --> 03:11:57.311
TALIESIN: Or she made Molly.

03:11:57.311 --> 03:11:59.891
MARISHA: Or she fucked up the ritual in some deliberate way.

03:11:59.891 --> 03:12:03.541
Yeah, she made Molly, and if--

03:12:03.541 --> 03:12:06.666
Yasha was saying that when Molly came back,

03:12:06.666 --> 03:12:09.222
he kept saying that he was empty.

03:12:11.640 --> 03:12:13.141
LAURA: Poor Molly.
SAM: Do you guys

03:12:13.141 --> 03:12:16.558
think that Molly and Vess

03:12:16.558 --> 03:12:21.278
are the only two of these eye people, these Nonagons?

03:12:21.278 --> 03:12:22.804
TALIESIN: No.
MARISHA: I don't think so.

03:12:23.768 --> 03:12:26.361
LAURA: I wonder if all of the other ones are--

03:12:26.361 --> 03:12:27.509
SAM: I feel like they are.

03:12:27.509 --> 03:12:30.891
I think it was just her, then she made a new one,

03:12:30.891 --> 03:12:35.891
and, like, the pupil overtook the-- the teacher.

03:12:35.904 --> 03:12:39.661
LIAM: (sighs)
TALIESIN: That-- that doesn't sound right.

03:12:39.661 --> 03:12:40.752
LAURA: What if

03:12:42.431 --> 03:12:44.741
<i>he</i> was her teacher?

03:12:46.829 --> 03:12:49.821
SAM: But he's so much younger than her. How would that work?

03:12:53.761 --> 03:12:57.111
LAURA: He's pretty powerful. I mean,
he was able to kill her.

03:12:57.111 --> 03:12:59.691
ASHLEY: Do, does--
TRAVIS: By himself?

03:12:59.691 --> 03:13:01.691
He was by himself.
LAURA: He was by himself.

03:13:02.971 --> 03:13:05.681
SAM: We think.
TRAVIS: Molly's a fucking champ!

03:13:05.681 --> 03:13:07.601
SAM: But, you know, he could've gotten an item

03:13:07.601 --> 03:13:12.401
or had some sort of-- because they are both Nonagon,

03:13:12.401 --> 03:13:14.591
maybe they had-- they know each other's one weakness.

03:13:14.591 --> 03:13:17.567
TRAVIS: Ooh!
SAM: You know, they're Highlanders!

03:13:17.567 --> 03:13:18.561
MARISHA: Also Nonagon.

03:13:18.561 --> 03:13:22.134
I mean, that's-- and that themes of nine.

03:13:23.181 --> 03:13:28.181
Nonagon feels like a family crest in a way, like a dynasty.

03:13:28.524 --> 03:13:30.074
TALIESIN: A title?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:13:30.074 --> 03:13:31.723
TALIESIN: It's a title.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:13:31.723 --> 03:13:34.154
MARISHA: So, why would only two people have that title?

03:13:34.154 --> 03:13:35.307
LIAM: How did we get--
TALIESIN: So far.

03:13:35.307 --> 03:13:36.789
TRAVIS: They were fighting for the title.

03:13:36.789 --> 03:13:38.431
MARISHA: Maybe they are fighting for the title.

03:13:38.431 --> 03:13:40.701
TALIESIN: There can be only one.
SAM: They're Highlanders,

03:13:40.701 --> 03:13:42.692
I'm telling you!
MARISHA: There-- yeah.

03:13:44.590 --> 03:13:48.011
SAM: (sighs) Okay.

03:13:48.011 --> 03:13:51.694
So, now, we're wasting time.

03:13:52.731 --> 03:13:54.772
Like, we should get on the road right away!

03:13:54.772 --> 03:13:55.938
TRAVIS: We really should.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:13:55.938 --> 03:13:59.030
TALIESIN: I thought that we need to
take care of business here, though.

03:13:59.030 --> 03:14:01.480
LAURA: Where are we going to put her?
LIAM: I have a question.

03:14:01.480 --> 03:14:04.201
Is amber, what I use for the Vault of Amber--

03:14:04.201 --> 03:14:07.128
one of my five stones that I talk about

03:14:07.128 --> 03:14:09.411
when I cast that spell was shattered.

03:14:09.411 --> 03:14:14.411
Is amber a rare enough thing that I only have four now,

03:14:14.598 --> 03:14:17.322
or would I be-- would I have--

03:14:17.322 --> 03:14:19.501
I know we never talked about it,
but would I have more than that,

03:14:19.501 --> 03:14:21.881
or do I need to go--
MATT: If you have not purchased

03:14:21.881 --> 03:14:24.491
additional pieces of amber, then finding

03:14:24.491 --> 03:14:27.601
additional ones would be challenging up here.

03:14:27.601 --> 03:14:29.201
Do you require five pieces to cast the spell?

03:14:29.201 --> 03:14:31.661
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: You could ask around.

03:14:31.661 --> 03:14:33.856
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to do that.

03:14:33.856 --> 03:14:36.239
I'm going to do that.
LAURA: You could look in the bag of jewels

03:14:36.239 --> 03:14:37.847
and see if there's any amber in there,

03:14:37.847 --> 03:14:40.483
but it's not really a jewel.

03:14:40.483 --> 03:14:41.983
LIAM: I just need one piece.

03:14:41.983 --> 03:14:43.396
SAM: Of amber?
LIAM: Yeah.

03:14:44.608 --> 03:14:46.021
Yeah.

03:14:46.021 --> 03:14:47.871
TALIESIN: Looking in my random stuff drawer.

03:14:47.871 --> 03:14:49.537
LAURA: I know, right?
SAM: I mean--

03:14:49.537 --> 03:14:52.291
LAURA: Can you transmute something into amber?

03:14:52.291 --> 03:14:53.626
LIAM: No.
LAURA: Okay.

03:14:53.626 --> 03:14:55.468
SAM: Let me see what I got.

03:14:55.468 --> 03:14:56.724
LIAM: No.

03:14:56.724 --> 03:14:59.671
SAM: I mean, amber is the color
of my energy, but that's about it.

03:14:59.671 --> 03:15:01.373
TRAVIS: We can put her in the Bag of Holding.

03:15:01.373 --> 03:15:03.139
We just have to...

03:15:03.139 --> 03:15:04.861
make it fit.

03:15:04.861 --> 03:15:05.850
LAURA: Oh god.

03:15:05.850 --> 03:15:07.558
MATT: (laughs) In quotes.

03:15:07.558 --> 03:15:08.691
TALIESIN: I mean--

03:15:08.691 --> 03:15:11.040
TRAVIS: Dork the Ox, baby!
MATT: Yeah!

03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:11.881
TRAVIS: OG!

03:15:12.851 --> 03:15:14.341
MARISHA: Well, we are having this discussion

03:15:14.341 --> 03:15:16.121
while he figures out if he has amber.

03:15:16.121 --> 03:15:18.251
LIAM: I'm going to-- I'm going to leave and let them talk,

03:15:18.251 --> 03:15:21.301
and I'm going to try to find something in this place.

03:15:21.301 --> 03:15:22.261
MATT: Okay, where you going?
LIAM: I'm just going to start

03:15:22.261 --> 03:15:24.103
asking around that I need spell components,

03:15:24.103 --> 03:15:27.045
that I'm here with Lady DeRogna
and I'm preparing for the journey.

03:15:27.045 --> 03:15:28.409
MATT: Okay.

03:15:30.821 --> 03:15:32.728
TALIESIN: I'm putting her back in stasis--

03:15:32.728 --> 03:15:35.427
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

03:15:37.671 --> 03:15:39.229
LIAM: 19.

03:15:39.229 --> 03:15:41.491
MATT: Okay. (sighs)

03:15:41.491 --> 03:15:43.601
For the better part of an hour, you ask around,

03:15:43.601 --> 03:15:44.617
and most folks are like,

03:15:44.617 --> 03:15:46.883
"I don't know where you're going to find amber in this,"

03:15:46.883 --> 03:15:49.401
or it's people, like, "I don't even know what amber is.

03:15:49.401 --> 03:15:50.939
I'm, just, you know--"

03:15:50.939 --> 03:15:51.955
LIAM: "I knew her."
TRAVIS: Outpost.

03:15:51.955 --> 03:15:55.691
MATT: Yep, yeah, there's some folks that are--

03:15:55.691 --> 03:15:57.521
you gather a lot of these people probably found

03:15:57.521 --> 03:16:00.511
their way from either Shadycreek Run or

03:16:02.201 --> 03:16:05.611
possibly paid off some sort of prison debt

03:16:05.611 --> 03:16:07.086
by working the post here.

03:16:08.091 --> 03:16:11.581
There's definitely an energy of

03:16:14.021 --> 03:16:17.029
people you wouldn't trust to turn your back on too long.

03:16:18.891 --> 03:16:23.451
You do eventually find one person that speaks up

03:16:23.451 --> 03:16:26.651
and goes, "Oh, you're looking for amber, are ye?"

03:16:26.651 --> 03:16:31.391
LIAM: Ah, yes, I have misplaced components for some

03:16:31.391 --> 03:16:34.911
of the things that I do, and I know I'm hard-pressed

03:16:34.911 --> 03:16:38.331
up here to find it, and I would pay a great deal for some.

03:16:38.331 --> 03:16:41.021
MATT: "Interesting, I just so happen for myself here,

03:16:41.021 --> 03:16:43.271
"a family heirloom that I keep around me,

03:16:43.271 --> 03:16:46.141
"keeping me safe and keeping my heart warm,

03:16:46.141 --> 03:16:47.733
"that's got some amber in it."

03:16:49.241 --> 03:16:50.431
LIAM: Well, I'm in the market.

03:16:50.431 --> 03:16:52.831
Would you be willing to part with it?

03:16:52.831 --> 03:16:55.251
MATT: "For the right price."

03:16:55.251 --> 03:16:56.392
LIAM: Okay.

03:16:57.641 --> 03:16:58.832
Here are

03:17:00.721 --> 03:17:04.861
two pearls worth roughly...

03:17:04.861 --> 03:17:08.824
I'm going to peg each of these at about 100 gold worth,

03:17:10.811 --> 03:17:13.694
probably way more than I would spend on the--

03:17:13.694 --> 03:17:16.121
MATT: "Getting warmer, getting warmer."

03:17:18.111 --> 03:17:19.252
LIAM: Here are

03:17:20.751 --> 03:17:24.414
three pearls between his fingers.

03:17:24.414 --> 03:17:25.680
LAURA: I was, like, how are you doing it?

03:17:25.680 --> 03:17:27.626
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's holding 'em. (pop)

03:17:27.626 --> 03:17:29.488
LIAM: I'm David Bowie-ing it.
MATT: Yep.

03:17:29.488 --> 03:17:30.804
LIAM: One, two, three.

03:17:30.804 --> 03:17:32.896
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
LIAM: Okay.

03:17:34.821 --> 03:17:35.654
Good.

03:17:36.571 --> 03:17:39.812
Persuasion, twenty...

03:17:39.812 --> 03:17:40.653
five.

03:17:40.653 --> 03:17:42.091
SAM: Woo!
MATT: Damn!

03:17:42.091 --> 03:17:42.924
TALIESIN: (whistles)

03:17:42.924 --> 03:17:47.512
MATT: "Oh, best not be telling me grammies."

03:17:47.512 --> 03:17:49.641
And he goes back into one of the tents on the side,

03:17:49.641 --> 03:17:52.431
and you hear the sound of, like, twine snapping

03:17:52.431 --> 03:17:55.451
and wood breaking, and he comes back out shrugging

03:17:55.451 --> 03:18:00.451
off this, looks like elements of knitted webbing,

03:18:00.782 --> 03:18:03.091
almost like some sort of a dreamcatcher-like device

03:18:03.091 --> 03:18:05.541
that's he's just smashed in two.

03:18:05.541 --> 03:18:07.066
He goes, pulls it out--

03:18:08.311 --> 03:18:10.086
"That'll do for ye!" And you look at it.

03:18:10.086 --> 03:18:12.381
It's a piece of amber.

03:18:12.381 --> 03:18:15.301
It has a little bit of a hole drilled through it,

03:18:15.301 --> 03:18:17.641
to where it was settled upon, but it's still a decent size.

03:18:17.641 --> 03:18:19.541
LIAM: And I know it's amber?

03:18:19.541 --> 03:18:22.351
MATT: Uh, you can go ahead and inspect it

03:18:22.351 --> 03:18:24.201
with a careful investigation check.

03:18:24.201 --> 03:18:27.201
LIAM: Okay, that is a 17.

03:18:27.201 --> 03:18:29.571
MATT: 17, looks to be pretty much amber, yeah.

03:18:29.571 --> 03:18:30.801
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: "Pretty much amber."

03:18:30.801 --> 03:18:32.891
MATT: Hard to fake amber, necessarily, unless you're-

03:18:32.891 --> 03:18:35.966
LIAM: Three, I drop the pearls.
TALIESIN: Only 16% real amber, aww.

03:18:35.966 --> 03:18:38.283
MARISHA: (laughs) Concentrated amber? Aww.

03:18:38.283 --> 03:18:40.311
MATT: "Let's hope it keeps you safe up here north.

03:18:40.311 --> 03:18:44.894
"Thank you for your patronage, and
looking for any other odds and ends,

03:18:44.894 --> 03:18:47.471
"don't be afraid to walk by and ask.
Who knows? I might have some."

03:18:47.471 --> 03:18:48.901
LIAM: No, thank, you, just that. (whooshes)

03:18:48.901 --> 03:18:50.911
Turn around, and I just start walking,

03:18:50.911 --> 03:18:54.141
speedwalk back to our room.

03:18:54.141 --> 03:18:55.649
MATT: You hear him behind you be like,

03:18:55.649 --> 03:18:58.791
"Just-- if anyone asks, I was helpful!"

03:18:58.791 --> 03:19:00.724
LIAM: Yep, dreamcatchers, you're the man!

03:19:01.871 --> 03:19:03.161
MATT: All right.
LIAM: I will make my way

03:19:03.161 --> 03:19:05.661
back in, and I don't know where they're at,

03:19:05.661 --> 03:19:08.681
but I will start, float back up to floor two,

03:19:08.681 --> 03:19:13.681
and I will make the ring of five amber stones in.

03:19:13.976 --> 03:19:16.839
Could we bring her here, please?

03:19:17.811 --> 03:19:20.801
If her body is laid into this oval shape,

03:19:20.801 --> 03:19:24.011
I begin to cast and mutter under my breath,

03:19:24.011 --> 03:19:26.341
and all five pieces of amber flash,

03:19:26.341 --> 03:19:29.461
and she glows for a second, and then,

03:19:29.461 --> 03:19:32.844
you see a quick flash of movement, and she's gone.

03:19:32.844 --> 03:19:36.501
And I pick up, (sighs) the one with the string

03:19:36.501 --> 03:19:39.988
on it, and I start to thread

03:19:40.901 --> 03:19:42.591
my chain through that.

03:19:42.591 --> 03:19:43.721
MATT: Easy enough to do.

03:19:43.721 --> 03:19:46.451
You can just faintly see in the amber this

03:19:48.151 --> 03:19:52.371
barely visible shaded outline of a body,

03:19:52.371 --> 03:19:55.471
suspended and miniaturized in the middle of the amber.

03:19:55.471 --> 03:19:56.321
TRAVIS: So cool.

03:19:57.201 --> 03:19:58.331
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Swell.

03:19:58.331 --> 03:19:59.681
TRAVIS: Tucked safely away.

03:19:59.681 --> 03:20:01.871
Now, we just need to get out of the building.

03:20:01.871 --> 03:20:03.011
MARISHA: Yeah, what's our story?
SAM: We just walk

03:20:03.011 --> 03:20:04.011
out of the building!
LAURA: Yeah.

03:20:04.011 --> 03:20:06.261
TRAVIS: Do we want to have her walk

03:20:07.431 --> 03:20:10.561
in a protective circle made by ourselves,

03:20:10.561 --> 03:20:13.081
or she just teleported out, and we will meet her?

03:20:13.081 --> 03:20:14.431
SAM: Why, why does she need to leave?

03:20:14.431 --> 03:20:15.291
She's feeling ill.

03:20:15.291 --> 03:20:16.838
We left her in her room.

03:20:16.838 --> 03:20:18.213
LAURA: Yeah, but they could check on her.

03:20:18.213 --> 03:20:19.161
I mean, should we make her--
SAM: Sure, she's not there!

03:20:19.161 --> 03:20:20.508
She's a super-magic person.

03:20:20.508 --> 03:20:21.760
She can go wherever she wants

03:20:21.760 --> 03:20:23.359
to go and do whatever she wants to do.

03:20:23.359 --> 03:20:24.259
TRAVIS: That's true.

03:20:24.259 --> 03:20:25.092
SAM: They're not going to be, like, "Oh, no,

03:20:25.092 --> 03:20:26.181
"she left without telling us!"

03:20:26.181 --> 03:20:27.921
She's a crazy magic person!

03:20:27.921 --> 03:20:29.581
LIAM: But the next step was we are supposed

03:20:29.581 --> 03:20:30.821
to leave with our guide

03:20:30.821 --> 03:20:31.811
on an expedition.
MARISHA: Correct.

03:20:31.811 --> 03:20:34.531
That's my question, is what do we tell Dagen?

03:20:34.531 --> 03:20:36.001
SAM: So, for that, then, yes.

03:20:36.001 --> 03:20:38.421
Maybe we should have Vess come out

03:20:38.421 --> 03:20:40.351
and say, "Let go on the journey."

03:20:40.351 --> 03:20:42.825
TRAVIS: She could, or we could go out and say,

03:20:42.825 --> 03:20:47.400
"Lady Vess DeRogna has said that she will meet us at the--"

03:20:47.400 --> 03:20:50.671
(map rustling)
A destination halfway there.

03:20:50.671 --> 03:20:55.671
Let's call it A5 because it's halfway between A2 and A1

03:20:55.991 --> 03:20:59.791
and Balenpost, and she has a lead that she has

03:20:59.791 --> 03:21:02.951
to pursue right away, and that we must leave without delay,

03:21:02.951 --> 03:21:04.321
and if he says, "I don't leave without her,"

03:21:04.321 --> 03:21:07.671
then we can do the
Major Image or something like that.

03:21:07.671 --> 03:21:09.581
LIAM: Perhaps she has some Assembly business that is

03:21:09.581 --> 03:21:12.831
detaining her for a short time, and she will catch up.

03:21:12.831 --> 03:21:13.664
TRAVIS: I can use the map.

03:21:13.664 --> 03:21:14.931
I can point to it.

03:21:14.931 --> 03:21:16.348
It is her map, after all.

03:21:17.287 --> 03:21:18.748
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:21:18.748 --> 03:21:21.754
MARISHA: And she's going to use magic to get there?

03:21:22.701 --> 03:21:24.253
She's going to take that risk?

03:21:24.253 --> 03:21:25.924
She's decided to do that?

03:21:25.924 --> 03:21:26.757
LAURA: She's very powerful.

03:21:26.757 --> 03:21:28.261
TALIESIN: It's risky, but necessary?

03:21:28.261 --> 03:21:31.041
TRAVIS: It does mess with magic, but again, urgency.

03:21:31.041 --> 03:21:32.591
LAURA: Again, Dagen said he doesn't

03:21:32.591 --> 03:21:34.871
know anything about it anyway, so--

03:21:34.871 --> 03:21:36.963
TRAVIS: Yeah, Sheila, all hail Sheila.

03:21:36.963 --> 03:21:38.288
MARISHA: All right!

03:21:38.288 --> 03:21:40.461
TRAVIS: All right, I'll-- I'll leave.
MARISHA: Let's do it. You talk, of course.

03:21:40.461 --> 03:21:41.294
TRAVIS: Everyone stay in the room.

03:21:41.294 --> 03:21:43.201
I'll head down and make my way out

03:21:43.201 --> 03:21:45.211
to the bonfire where Dagen is.

03:21:45.211 --> 03:21:47.964
MATT: Okay, Dagen, at the moment, is not at the bonfire.

03:21:47.964 --> 03:21:49.920
SAM: Damn it!
TRAVIS: Shitballs, fuck-ass!

03:21:51.171 --> 03:21:53.899
Was he downstairs when I was passing through?

03:21:53.899 --> 03:21:55.451
MATT: No.

03:21:55.451 --> 03:21:58.236
SAM: Go tête-à-tête! (laughs)

03:21:59.191 --> 03:22:00.641
TRAVIS: Anyone else at the bonfire?

03:22:01.691 --> 03:22:02.961
MATT: Not specifically.

03:22:02.961 --> 03:22:04.491
There are some guards that are near

03:22:04.491 --> 03:22:06.254
just for the proximity of heat.

03:22:07.931 --> 03:22:09.615
You know, it's not a huge bonfire, you know.

03:22:09.615 --> 03:22:10.891
It's just--
TRAVIS: Just a fire.

03:22:10.891 --> 03:22:13.561
MATT: Just a small fire.
TRAVIS: Anyone see where Dagen went?

03:22:13.561 --> 03:22:16.401
MATT: Two of them point over to this green tent,

03:22:16.401 --> 03:22:19.301
decent size, that sits near the northeast gate, the gate.

03:22:19.301 --> 03:22:22.072
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'll make my way over to the tent.

03:22:22.072 --> 03:22:25.271
(clears throat) Dagen, are you in?

03:22:25.271 --> 03:22:27.791
MATT: "Yeah. (sniffs)"

03:22:27.791 --> 03:22:29.541
TRAVIS: Could I trouble you for a moment?

03:22:31.388 --> 03:22:32.951
MATT: You hear the sound of wheels

03:22:32.951 --> 03:22:36.101
pushing through the dirt before the flap opens up,

03:22:36.101 --> 03:22:39.801
and you see him in the process of cleaning up a bit.

03:22:39.801 --> 03:22:41.621
He looks like he's washed himself a little bit,

03:22:41.621 --> 03:22:42.521
and his face is a little damp.

03:22:42.521 --> 03:22:44.251
He's got a little, like, washcloth right there

03:22:44.251 --> 03:22:46.401
that's starting to, like, already, ice crystals

03:22:46.401 --> 03:22:47.941
are starting to hit the edges.

03:22:47.941 --> 03:22:49.371
He opens up the front.

03:22:49.371 --> 03:22:52.801
"Are y'all-- y'all looking ready to go?"

03:22:52.801 --> 03:22:55.371
TRAVIS: It appears there's been
a development with Lady DeRogna.

03:22:55.371 --> 03:22:59.231
She left with some urgency on Assembly business.

03:22:59.231 --> 03:23:01.251
She is going to meet us-- and I'll unfold

03:23:01.251 --> 03:23:03.541
the map that she gave me-- here.

03:23:03.541 --> 03:23:07.091
She pointed to this red dot labeled A5.

03:23:07.091 --> 03:23:08.861
Are you familiar with this area?

03:23:08.861 --> 03:23:09.881
MATT: "I am indeed."

03:23:09.881 --> 03:23:14.431
TRAVIS: She said for us to leave
posthaste and to meet her there.

03:23:14.431 --> 03:23:15.981
MATT: "She's not coming?"

03:23:15.981 --> 03:23:17.791
TRAVIS: She's going to meet us there.

03:23:17.791 --> 03:23:20.264
I'm afraid it was quite urgent.

03:23:21.501 --> 03:23:23.891
MATT: "All right, so are you handling my pay?"

03:23:23.891 --> 03:23:25.707
TRAVIS: Indeed. We are good for it.

03:23:25.707 --> 03:23:26.901
MATT: "All right, so long as someone's paying me.

03:23:26.901 --> 03:23:28.231
"I don't care who we're escorting."

03:23:28.231 --> 03:23:29.441
TRAVIS: I'll gather the rest.

03:23:29.441 --> 03:23:31.441
Be ready to go in five minutes, perhaps?

03:23:32.821 --> 03:23:34.272
MATT: "Eh, give me seven."

03:23:34.272 --> 03:23:35.831
TRAVIS: Seven it is.

03:23:35.831 --> 03:23:38.447
We'll meet you back here at your fine tent.

03:23:38.447 --> 03:23:40.271
MATT: "(sniffs) Damn right."

03:23:40.271 --> 03:23:41.451
TRAVIS: Do we need to collect anything?

03:23:41.451 --> 03:23:42.581
No, on foot, okay.

03:23:42.581 --> 03:23:43.531
Good, good talk!

03:23:43.531 --> 03:23:44.796
And I just start heading back.

03:23:44.796 --> 03:23:46.031
(laughter)

03:23:46.031 --> 03:23:48.748
MATT: You hear him behind you going, "He's weird."

03:23:48.748 --> 03:23:49.969
(laughter)

03:23:49.969 --> 03:23:52.151
And the flap closes, and he starts gathering his things.

03:23:52.151 --> 03:23:55.056
TRAVIS: Make my way up, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum.

03:23:55.981 --> 03:23:57.801
LAURA: Wonder how much he's--

03:23:57.801 --> 03:23:59.381
TRAVIS: As I pass that second floor,

03:23:59.381 --> 03:24:00.701
how many guards are on that second floor?

03:24:00.701 --> 03:24:01.821
SAM: We'll kill them before we--

03:24:01.821 --> 03:24:03.271
MATT: In that general area?

03:24:03.271 --> 03:24:05.044
Right now, there's six.

03:24:06.334 --> 03:24:07.891
It's not terribly crowded.

03:24:07.891 --> 03:24:11.341
Most everyone else is amongst the Balenfort itself.

03:24:11.341 --> 03:24:15.541
TRAVIS: Lady DeRogna is not to be
disturbed for the next 24 hours.

03:24:15.541 --> 03:24:17.221
She needs her rest.

03:24:17.221 --> 03:24:20.301
Again, if you really need something,

03:24:20.301 --> 03:24:21.691
please do knock quietly.

03:24:21.691 --> 03:24:25.081
If there is no answer at the door, do not disturb her.

03:24:25.081 --> 03:24:26.034
Am I clear?

03:24:27.271 --> 03:24:28.301
MATT: There's a slight pause.

03:24:28.301 --> 03:24:29.994
They all look at each other.

03:24:31.511 --> 03:24:34.544
"Clear." "Clear." "Clear." "Whatever."

03:24:34.544 --> 03:24:35.871
(laughter)

03:24:35.871 --> 03:24:37.040
TRAVIS: I like the "whatever."

03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:38.271
(laughter)

03:24:38.271 --> 03:24:40.181
Excellent, I'll go back up, shut the door.

03:24:40.181 --> 03:24:41.014
Okay, we're good.

03:24:41.014 --> 03:24:43.927
I think we're good.
TALIESIN: Wait, I got an idea.

03:24:43.927 --> 03:24:46.539
MARISHA: What?
TALIESIN: Leave a note.

03:24:46.539 --> 03:24:48.881
MARISHA: Huh?
LAURA: Oh, I can forge!

03:24:48.881 --> 03:24:51.871
TRAVIS: Yeah, smart.
LAURA: I'll forge something.

03:24:51.871 --> 03:24:54.354
Do I have any writing from her?

03:24:58.211 --> 03:25:00.761
SAM: I don't, but we can look around the room!

03:25:00.761 --> 03:25:01.727
LAURA: Yeah, sure.
TRAVIS: And even though they picked her

03:25:01.727 --> 03:25:02.741
clean and took her shit,

03:25:02.741 --> 03:25:04.257
there's nothing of hers that

03:25:04.257 --> 03:25:05.572
we're going to leave behind, right,

03:25:05.572 --> 03:25:06.405
at all?
LAURA: Any writing.

03:25:06.405 --> 03:25:07.934
I'm looking for any writing of hers.

03:25:08.981 --> 03:25:10.531
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

03:25:10.531 --> 03:25:11.364
TRAVIS: We have, like, all of her clothes,

03:25:11.364 --> 03:25:13.171
and all that other shit?

03:25:13.171 --> 03:25:14.221
SAM: Want me to help you?

03:25:14.221 --> 03:25:15.171
LAURA: Yeah!
SAM: I'll help you

03:25:15.171 --> 03:25:16.771
look around.
TALIESIN: I mean, any-- I assume

03:25:16.771 --> 03:25:18.821
we're going to collect anything of hers and throw it

03:25:18.821 --> 03:25:20.441
in a Bag of Holding.
LIAM: We might find some example

03:25:20.441 --> 03:25:21.371
of her writing in this room.

03:25:21.371 --> 03:25:24.061
MATT: There is very little of her things

03:25:24.061 --> 03:25:25.131
that have been left behind.

03:25:25.131 --> 03:25:27.906
Anything that was on her was taken.

03:25:27.906 --> 03:25:29.721
Anything that she brought with her, which wasn't much,

03:25:29.721 --> 03:25:30.661
at least from what you could see.

03:25:30.661 --> 03:25:32.781
TRAVIS: Just, like, shoes, coats, anything?

03:25:32.781 --> 03:25:36.921
MATT: Right, and someone of her personage would probably

03:25:36.921 --> 03:25:39.561
have a number of other devices upon her

03:25:39.561 --> 03:25:41.601
to carry more than you see on her,

03:25:41.601 --> 03:25:45.941
as you guys have the same accessibility elements,

03:25:45.941 --> 03:25:48.173
but those were taken as well.

03:25:48.173 --> 03:25:49.570
LAURA: 18.
MATT: 18.

03:25:50.861 --> 03:25:55.291
You look throughout the room, and you cannot find anything

03:25:55.291 --> 03:25:56.971
that is distinctly her handwriting because you don't

03:25:56.971 --> 03:25:59.271
really know what her handwriting looks like.

03:25:59.271 --> 03:26:02.271
Most of the books here are written in ink by hand,

03:26:02.271 --> 03:26:04.371
but they have multiple different types of handwriting,

03:26:04.371 --> 03:26:08.051
and a lot of them are just hand-copied tomes

03:26:08.051 --> 03:26:10.371
of all different subjects.

03:26:10.371 --> 03:26:14.664
You have nothing that you know definitively as her writing.

03:26:15.841 --> 03:26:17.461
SAM: Okay, what about this?

03:26:17.461 --> 03:26:22.461
Not to make you blow spells or anything, but Mr. Caleb,

03:26:22.725 --> 03:26:24.731
can't you do an illusion

03:26:24.731 --> 03:26:27.561
that will be triggered upon someone entering,

03:26:27.561 --> 03:26:30.038
like a hologram or something?

03:26:30.038 --> 03:26:31.971
TRAVIS: Just a thought: this map is hers.

03:26:33.131 --> 03:26:35.971
Did she notate on this map?

03:26:35.971 --> 03:26:37.016
SAM: Says a lot of As.

03:26:38.301 --> 03:26:43.301
MATT: From what you can tell,
the map was not created by her,

03:26:44.131 --> 03:26:46.691
but some of the notes for the locations,

03:26:46.691 --> 03:26:49.794
like the excavation points, the handwriting is different,

03:26:51.241 --> 03:26:54.371
like where it says Aeor, and where

03:26:54.371 --> 03:26:56.321
the A number, A number is.

03:26:56.321 --> 03:27:01.219
It's not a lot to go off of, but it's the start.

03:27:01.219 --> 03:27:03.211
TALIESIN: Not like anybody here's going to know.

03:27:03.211 --> 03:27:05.951
MATT: Right, so there would be a-- the DC would be higher

03:27:05.951 --> 03:27:08.861
to make it a flawless forgery because you're basing it

03:27:08.861 --> 03:27:12.254
off of, you know, a handful of letters of the alphabet,

03:27:12.254 --> 03:27:14.896
and a couple numbers.
LAURA: What kind of a check is that?

03:27:14.896 --> 03:27:17.611
Is that a perform, what is that?

03:27:17.611 --> 03:27:21.301
MATT: For that, that would be a dexterity,

03:27:21.301 --> 03:27:23.671
and if you're proficient with a forgery kit,

03:27:23.671 --> 03:27:25.371
then it would be adding a proficiency bonus.

03:27:25.371 --> 03:27:26.204
LAURA: Okay.

03:27:29.111 --> 03:27:30.761
LIAM: And I could leave an illusion behind,

03:27:30.761 --> 03:27:32.501
but I could not do it today.

03:27:32.501 --> 03:27:35.351
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on myself.

03:27:35.351 --> 03:27:36.721
MATT: Okay.

03:27:36.721 --> 03:27:38.201
LAURA: I'm going to sit down and I'm going to try to write.

03:27:38.201 --> 03:27:39.361
MATT: I assume Cat's Grace, then?

03:27:39.361 --> 03:27:40.741
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: All right.

03:27:40.741 --> 03:27:42.821
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:27:42.821 --> 03:27:43.762
Jester, come here.

03:27:43.762 --> 03:27:44.621
LAURA: What?

03:27:44.621 --> 03:27:47.701
LIAM: I pull out one of my remaining pearls and place it

03:27:49.341 --> 03:27:50.781
at your forehead, between your eyes,

03:27:50.781 --> 03:27:55.161
and geometric patterns begin to form in a circle or a hex

03:27:55.161 --> 03:27:56.821
around my hand--
LAURA: It's so pretty!

03:27:56.821 --> 03:28:00.801
LIAM: -- and I have cast Fate's Touch,

03:28:00.801 --> 03:28:02.569
so that's a re-roll if you need.

03:28:02.569 --> 03:28:03.679
LAURA: Thank you.
(paper rustling)

03:28:03.679 --> 03:28:05.341
TALIESIN: What are we saying, just so we're clear?

03:28:05.341 --> 03:28:06.801
LAURA: Yeah, I need to know that.

03:28:06.801 --> 03:28:08.310
SAM: Gone fishing!

03:28:08.310 --> 03:28:10.364
(laughter)
LIAM: Yep, yep!

03:28:13.301 --> 03:28:14.911
LIAM: Fortune's Favor, excuse me.

03:28:14.911 --> 03:28:17.547
TALIESIN: Unexpected development, I don't know.

03:28:17.547 --> 03:28:19.711
MATT: We knew what you meant.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:28:19.711 --> 03:28:22.491
TALIESIN: Something about having to
leave on a secret mission.

03:28:22.491 --> 03:28:26.324
LIAM: All my pearls are gone!
LAURA: Unexpected Assembly business.

03:28:28.641 --> 03:28:33.581
SAM: When the Mighty Nein return, tell them I'm okay.

03:28:33.581 --> 03:28:34.851
LAURA: When the Mighty Nein return,

03:28:34.851 --> 03:28:37.138
send them on to something something.

03:28:37.138 --> 03:28:38.404
SAM: Sure.

03:28:38.404 --> 03:28:39.564
MARISHA: If we frame it right,

03:28:40.591 --> 03:28:43.491
it could cover

03:28:43.491 --> 03:28:46.239
when people find out that she's definitely dead.

03:28:46.239 --> 03:28:49.351
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:28:49.351 --> 03:28:52.504
MARISHA: You know, but something drove me to go.

03:28:53.391 --> 03:28:54.911
SAM: Oh, like it's a suicide note?

03:28:54.911 --> 03:28:58.402
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no, like, I needed to--

03:28:58.402 --> 03:28:59.496
LAURA: We could send a track--
SAM: I hate being one

03:28:59.496 --> 03:29:00.431
of the bad guys!
LAURA: -- somewhere else.

03:29:00.431 --> 03:29:02.272
SAM: I'm going to end it all!

03:29:04.763 --> 03:29:08.347
LAURA: To send a track to somewhere else, right? So, like,

03:29:09.851 --> 03:29:14.551
urgent business in, urgent business has taken me elsewhere.

03:29:14.551 --> 03:29:18.554
When the Mighty Nein return, send them after me.

03:29:20.804 --> 03:29:22.520
SAM: That's it.
MARISHA: That's, yeah.

03:29:22.520 --> 03:29:24.604
LAURA: Where, though?
SAM: VD.

03:29:24.604 --> 03:29:26.461
MARISHA: I mean, where we're going, right?

03:29:26.461 --> 03:29:29.704
TALIESIN: Send them to previously agreed place.

03:29:29.704 --> 03:29:31.091
LAURA: Oh, that's a good one!

03:29:31.091 --> 03:29:32.991
LIAM: Tell them to--
MARISHA: It's true.

03:29:33.831 --> 03:29:35.651
LIAM: -- send me a message.

03:29:35.651 --> 03:29:36.949
SAM: Sure.
LIAM: As you so often do.

03:29:36.949 --> 03:29:38.421
LAURA: That's good. That's good.

03:29:38.421 --> 03:29:39.861
SAM: Yeah, keep it vague, keep it vague.

03:29:39.861 --> 03:29:42.397
LAURA: I'm going to write that.
MARISHA: Keep it vague.

03:29:42.397 --> 03:29:43.847
LAURA: I'm going to--

03:29:44.971 --> 03:29:47.361
Hold on, I'm going to make sure that guiding myself

03:29:47.361 --> 03:29:49.651
won't cancel that out.

03:29:49.651 --> 03:29:51.531
SAM: To make it sound really authentic,

03:29:51.531 --> 03:29:54.298
though, should it be from the Lavorre--

03:29:54.298 --> 03:29:55.450
MATT: You can't guide yourself on top of it.
LAURA: I know.

03:29:55.450 --> 03:29:57.141
MATT: Because they're both concentration.
LAURA: That's why I just checked.

03:29:57.141 --> 03:29:58.082
Yeah, that's what I just checked.

03:29:58.082 --> 03:29:59.168
I'm like, I'm not going to guide myself,

03:29:59.168 --> 03:30:00.451
but you can guide me.

03:30:00.451 --> 03:30:01.939
TALIESIN: Oh!

03:30:01.939 --> 03:30:04.906
SAM: I think you should make it from the Lavorre &amp; Nott

03:30:05.981 --> 03:30:09.887
law firm, just so that it's extra authentic!
LAURA: No, why?!

03:30:09.887 --> 03:30:11.307
That doesn't make any sense!

03:30:11.307 --> 03:30:13.861
(laughter)

03:30:13.861 --> 03:30:14.851
TALIESIN: You're guided.

03:30:14.851 --> 03:30:16.445
LIAM: Good idea the first time.

03:30:16.445 --> 03:30:18.573
LAURA: La-la-la, I'm going to write all those things

03:30:18.573 --> 03:30:19.790
that we just said.
MATT: Okay.

03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:20.785
LIAM: (garbled mumbling)

03:30:20.785 --> 03:30:22.385
TRAVIS: I just sent you a close-up of the map

03:30:22.385 --> 03:30:23.761
so you can see.

03:30:23.761 --> 03:30:25.589
SAM: Yeah, put a lot of As in this note.

03:30:25.589 --> 03:30:26.476
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah.

03:30:26.476 --> 03:30:27.718
(laughter)

03:30:27.718 --> 03:30:29.181
MATT: Haaaay--

03:30:29.181 --> 03:30:30.644
Without even spelling it right.

03:30:31.494 --> 03:30:33.138
LIAM: Aw, maaan!

03:30:33.138 --> 03:30:35.504
TRAVIS: Yeah, Taliesin's next Narrative Telephone.

03:30:35.504 --> 03:30:36.814
TALIESIN: (cackles)

03:30:36.814 --> 03:30:40.527
TRAVIS: Adorable, atrocious--
SAM: This is ba-na-nas!

03:30:40.527 --> 03:30:41.379
MATT: All right.

03:30:41.379 --> 03:30:43.221
With much

03:30:44.291 --> 03:30:48.611
magical direction placed upon this forgery attempt

03:30:48.611 --> 03:30:52.581
with the modicum of example handwriting that you hope

03:30:52.581 --> 03:30:55.721
is hers, I would like you

03:30:55.721 --> 03:30:57.201
to go ahead and make your roll.

03:30:57.201 --> 03:30:59.568
LAURA: Okay, so, I get--
TRAVIS: I'll assist you! No.

03:30:59.568 --> 03:31:01.101
LAURA: I get advantage.

03:31:01.101 --> 03:31:02.781
MARISHA: Guidance!
LAURA: And I'm guided.

03:31:02.781 --> 03:31:04.570
MATT: Right, so, you have your proficiency bonus to it,

03:31:04.570 --> 03:31:06.333
which is five, I believe?

03:31:06.333 --> 03:31:07.166
LAURA: Yes.

03:31:07.166 --> 03:31:08.999
MATT: And then what's your dex bonus?

03:31:09.942 --> 03:31:11.083
LAURA: Plus four.

03:31:11.083 --> 03:31:13.581
MATT: Plus four, so that's plus nine to what you roll.

03:31:13.581 --> 03:31:15.191
That's pretty good.
TRAVIS: With advantage.

03:31:15.191 --> 03:31:16.299
LAURA: Yes, with advantage.

03:31:16.299 --> 03:31:18.388
MATT: Advantage and one re-roll, if you need it.

03:31:18.388 --> 03:31:19.421
LAURA: Oh god!
TALIESIN: And a d4.

03:31:19.421 --> 03:31:20.711
LIAM: You are the greatest trickster

03:31:20.711 --> 03:31:22.056
that has ever walked the earth.

03:31:22.056 --> 03:31:24.687
LAURA: (muttering) Hell yeah,

03:31:24.687 --> 03:31:25.920
hold on.

03:31:27.180 --> 03:31:30.529
Whoa! Hold on.

03:31:33.051 --> 03:31:36.024
LAURA: That's 29.
ALL: Ooh!

03:31:37.218 --> 03:31:38.051
MARISHA: Sexy!

03:31:38.051 --> 03:31:41.901
LAURA: Without re-rolling.
TRAVIS: One shy, one shy.

03:31:41.901 --> 03:31:42.864
I think it's a 30.

03:31:44.248 --> 03:31:47.179
LAURA: Should I try to use my--?

03:31:47.179 --> 03:31:48.021
SAM: Your re-roll?
LIAM: I mean, you have to think--

03:31:48.021 --> 03:31:50.676
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: -- would you use it later today?

03:31:50.676 --> 03:31:51.819
SAM: No!
LIAM: Probably not.

03:31:51.819 --> 03:31:53.435
LAURA: Okay, okay.
MATT: It's up to you.

03:31:53.435 --> 03:31:55.831
LAURA: But if I use it, does that cancel out the--

03:31:55.831 --> 03:31:57.616
TRAVIS: I mean, can you roll higher?
LAURA: Could I use it if I want to, but--

03:31:57.616 --> 03:31:58.989
LIAM: Yeah, you can use it if you want.

03:31:58.989 --> 03:32:00.426
TRAVIS: Can you roll higher than 29?

03:32:00.426 --> 03:32:02.741
SAM: Oh, wait, you can't add

03:32:02.741 --> 03:32:04.487
his stuff to this roll.
TALIESIN: You can.

03:32:04.487 --> 03:32:05.320
SAM: You can?

03:32:05.320 --> 03:32:07.487
MATT: It's the same check, technically.
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:32:09.528 --> 03:32:10.361
Do it!

03:32:10.361 --> 03:32:13.194
LIAM: Choose which of the d20s to use.

03:32:14.781 --> 03:32:16.591
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to stick with 29.

03:32:16.591 --> 03:32:19.081
MATT: Okay, you complete the forgery,

03:32:19.081 --> 03:32:21.554
feeling pretty damn good with the work you did.

03:32:22.971 --> 03:32:24.491
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Pretty damn good.

03:32:24.491 --> 03:32:26.721
LAURA: We're going to leave--
SAM: And squirt a little perfume on it.

03:32:26.721 --> 03:32:28.322
MATT: You're impressed. With what little

03:32:28.322 --> 03:32:29.469
you're able to pull from this,

03:32:29.469 --> 03:32:30.608
you're, like--
LAURA: It's looking good.

03:32:30.608 --> 03:32:32.801
MARISHA: Little lipstick smear on the corner.

03:32:32.801 --> 03:32:35.501
MATT: If adventuring wasn't working, and the Gentleman

03:32:35.501 --> 03:32:37.301
was looking, you have a bright future.

03:32:37.301 --> 03:32:39.361
TRAVIS: Fake IDs, baby!
MATT: Yeah.

03:32:39.361 --> 03:32:43.584
So you feel confident that this'll probably work.

03:32:45.121 --> 03:32:48.002
LAURA: Okay, now--

03:32:48.002 --> 03:32:49.361
SAM: Now let's get outta here.

03:32:49.361 --> 03:32:53.258
LAURA: We made sure 100% there's no blood left in this room.

03:32:53.258 --> 03:32:54.933
SAM: We cleaned up everything. We put it in a trunk.

03:32:54.933 --> 03:32:56.601
Should we take the blood-soaked stuff

03:32:56.601 --> 03:32:57.792
and put it in our Bag of Holding?

03:32:57.792 --> 03:32:58.771
MARISHA: 100%.
LAURA: Yes.

03:32:58.771 --> 03:33:00.241
MARISHA: Take everything.
TALIESIN: Taking everything with us.

03:33:00.241 --> 03:33:01.181
MARISHA: We check under the bed.

03:33:01.181 --> 03:33:04.561
We make sure there's no spare socks.
LAURA: Take all of her stuff that she left.

03:33:04.561 --> 03:33:07.494
MARISHA: No plushies have gotten knocked under the bed.

03:33:08.801 --> 03:33:10.376
MATT: Whoever's keeping track of the contents

03:33:10.376 --> 03:33:14.051
of the Bag of Holding, write "bloody DeRogna remnants."

03:33:14.051 --> 03:33:15.441
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's me!

03:33:15.441 --> 03:33:16.967
LAURA: That's you? (laughs)
MATT: That's you.

03:33:16.967 --> 03:33:18.391
LIAM: It's just her bathroom bag.

03:33:18.391 --> 03:33:19.631
MATT: Right.
MARISHA: Yeah, toiletries.

03:33:19.631 --> 03:33:20.661
SAM: We'll dump it in a dumpster

03:33:20.661 --> 03:33:21.905
on the way out of town.

03:33:21.905 --> 03:33:24.200
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh jeez, this is dark!

03:33:24.200 --> 03:33:25.341
SAM: (laughs)
LIAM: Terrible.

03:33:25.341 --> 03:33:27.111
Not just throw in a snowdrift in the middle

03:33:27.111 --> 03:33:29.616
of the tundra somewhere.
SAM: (laughs) Nope!

03:33:29.616 --> 03:33:31.511
LAURA: This is going in the fire river for sure.

03:33:31.511 --> 03:33:33.311
SAM: Oh, yeah.
LIAM: (flame whooshes)

03:33:33.311 --> 03:33:35.591
TALIESIN: Can't solve all of our problems by throwing them

03:33:35.591 --> 03:33:37.854
into the fire river.
LAURA: Yes, you can, Caduceus.

03:33:37.854 --> 03:33:39.591
You can!

03:33:39.591 --> 03:33:41.731
SAM: All right, so it's been seven minutes.

03:33:41.731 --> 03:33:45.911
We should meet up with what's his name, Dagen?

03:33:45.911 --> 03:33:47.521
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's go.

03:33:47.521 --> 03:33:48.354
MARISHA: Oh, lord.
MATT: All right.

03:33:48.354 --> 03:33:50.837
LIAM: It'll be an awkward conversation with Dagen later.

03:33:50.837 --> 03:33:51.787
TALIESIN: In a couple days.
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

03:33:51.787 --> 03:33:54.801
MARISHA: There's going to be, like, 30 awkward conversations

03:33:54.801 --> 03:33:55.808
because of this.

03:33:55.808 --> 03:33:56.641
LIAM: Just, you know,

03:33:56.641 --> 03:33:59.731
he likes his drinks, so we could just keep him

03:33:59.731 --> 03:34:01.376
in the sweet middle ground.

03:34:01.376 --> 03:34:02.746
MARISHA: A little hazy all the time?

03:34:02.746 --> 03:34:04.821
TRAVIS: To be fair, I think he only cared about being paid.

03:34:04.821 --> 03:34:06.609
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
TALIESIN: Do we have the infinite flask?

03:34:06.609 --> 03:34:07.938
LAURA: How much does he get paid?

03:34:07.938 --> 03:34:10.191
TRAVIS: I didn't ask.
MATT: You did not ask.

03:34:10.191 --> 03:34:13.751
LAURA: Well, she was going to pay us 75,000 gold, so.

03:34:13.751 --> 03:34:14.601
TALIESIN: We'll find out!

03:34:14.601 --> 03:34:17.621
LAURA: We're not going to get that anymore.
LIAM: She's not anymore.

03:34:17.621 --> 03:34:21.493
MARISHA: Oh man. Hadn't thought that far!

03:34:21.493 --> 03:34:23.076
TRAVIS: Aww, why'd we have to do that!

03:34:23.076 --> 03:34:24.311
MARISHA: I hadn't thought that far ahead.

03:34:24.311 --> 03:34:25.701
Yeah, that sucks!

03:34:25.701 --> 03:34:29.111
TRAVIS: Matthew!
LIAM: (laughs)

03:34:29.111 --> 03:34:31.681
MATT: Hey, I wasn't, I wasn't hired to keep her safe!

03:34:31.681 --> 03:34:33.131
TRAVIS: It feels like the end of Se7en,

03:34:33.131 --> 03:34:35.294
where we missed the-- (groans)

03:34:35.294 --> 03:34:36.781
LIAM: But hey, guys, adventure!

03:34:36.781 --> 03:34:38.731
TALIESIN: That is, on a certain level, the perfect alibi.

03:34:38.731 --> 03:34:41.063
We just lost out on a ton of money.

03:34:41.063 --> 03:34:42.035
(laughter)

03:34:42.035 --> 03:34:43.526
LIAM: That's true, that's fair.

03:34:43.526 --> 03:34:45.193
Maybe we should still

03:34:45.193 --> 03:34:46.461
get, like, a third, though.

03:34:46.461 --> 03:34:47.591
LAURA: We can't feel that bad, though.

03:34:47.591 --> 03:34:49.581
She did torture your husband.

03:34:49.581 --> 03:34:51.681
SAM: Yeah, I'm super-stoked right now!

03:34:51.681 --> 03:34:52.942
ASHLEY: True, true, true!

03:34:52.942 --> 03:34:55.071
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: I literally wrote down

03:34:55.071 --> 03:34:58.083
in my notebook, "Kill Vess!"

03:34:58.083 --> 03:35:01.140
(laughter)

03:35:01.140 --> 03:35:02.211
TRAVIS: Good, good.

03:35:02.211 --> 03:35:03.860
TALIESIN: That's a weird dream diary you have.

03:35:03.860 --> 03:35:05.071
(laughter)

03:35:05.071 --> 03:35:07.531
MATT: It's just a bunch of things that she wants to kill.

03:35:07.531 --> 03:35:08.941
TRAVIS: You could send a message to your husband,

03:35:08.941 --> 03:35:10.894
letting him know you completed the task.

03:35:10.894 --> 03:35:13.031
SAM: Yeah. (laughs)

03:35:13.031 --> 03:35:15.511
MATT: All right, so you guys just exit down the stairs

03:35:15.511 --> 03:35:16.651
on the way out?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:35:16.651 --> 03:35:17.691
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Lock the door.

03:35:17.691 --> 03:35:19.239
We don't have a key.
MARISHA: Do do-do do-do.

03:35:19.239 --> 03:35:20.546
MATT: All right, as you all--

03:35:20.546 --> 03:35:21.641
TRAVIS: Do you have the dagger? (clicks tongue)

03:35:21.641 --> 03:35:23.281
SAM: I do have the dagger.

03:35:23.281 --> 03:35:25.331
I could use it.
TRAVIS: Lock it.

03:35:25.331 --> 03:35:27.374
SAM: I'd have to re-attune to it. It'll take an hour.

03:35:27.374 --> 03:35:29.856
MATT: You can do that if you want to.
LIAM: Don't we want it to be opened, though?

03:35:29.856 --> 03:35:32.940
MATT: If you un-attune from it, it does unlock.

03:35:32.940 --> 03:35:34.291
SAM: Then forget it, won't work.

03:35:34.291 --> 03:35:35.201
TRAVIS: It's fine.

03:35:35.201 --> 03:35:37.225
SAM: Unless we really want it locked, because I can do it.

03:35:37.225 --> 03:35:38.058
TALIESIN: No, that's-- we're going.

03:35:38.058 --> 03:35:39.661
LIAM: No, 'cause she's going. She's left.

03:35:39.661 --> 03:35:41.093
TALIESIN: Yeah, she's left.
TRAVIS: We have 24 hours.

03:35:41.093 --> 03:35:42.393
They're not going to disturb that door.

03:35:42.393 --> 03:35:44.361
LIAM: Yeah, she's not going to
magically lock a door when she left.

03:35:44.361 --> 03:35:47.361
MATT: As the door opens, you can hear there's conversation

03:35:47.361 --> 03:35:50.891
about the various denizens of the second floor,

03:35:50.891 --> 03:35:53.001
but as soon as the door opens,

03:35:53.001 --> 03:35:56.061
they get quiet, and you guys walk down.

03:35:56.061 --> 03:35:57.831
They're all sitting there with their cards,

03:35:57.831 --> 03:36:01.171
just watching you go by, a little intimidated

03:36:01.171 --> 03:36:03.044
by what you represent and--

03:36:03.044 --> 03:36:06.001
TRAVIS: I just stop and eyeball
them as everyone else walks past.

03:36:06.001 --> 03:36:06.834
MATT: They just cough

03:36:06.834 --> 03:36:09.607
and go back to their card game quietly.

03:36:09.607 --> 03:36:11.140
LAURA: Is Kieron there?

03:36:11.140 --> 03:36:12.617
MATT: Not in that place, no.

03:36:14.211 --> 03:36:16.702
You do make your way down

03:36:16.702 --> 03:36:19.985
to the base of Balenpost Fort,

03:36:21.171 --> 03:36:25.811
exit out into the freezing cold courtyard

03:36:26.741 --> 03:36:29.891
between the tall, wooden log walls,

03:36:29.891 --> 03:36:33.071
now almost oppressive with the knowledge you have,

03:36:33.071 --> 03:36:37.101
and all the eyes around you that occasionally glance

03:36:37.101 --> 03:36:41.241
your direction, naturally, as they would,

03:36:41.241 --> 03:36:44.531
but yet seem almost boring through you,

03:36:46.727 --> 03:36:49.051
yet you continue forward to the edge of the bonfire,

03:36:49.051 --> 03:36:53.691
where you see there is Dagen, prepared, bundled,

03:36:53.691 --> 03:36:57.271
armored, big, thick coat on, strapped into his chair,

03:36:57.271 --> 03:37:00.671
which you now see has these metallic

03:37:02.821 --> 03:37:05.571
pieces of sheet metal on each side that have some sort

03:37:05.571 --> 03:37:08.061
of contraption set up within that curve upward

03:37:08.061 --> 03:37:11.571
at the front, and as you approach, he spins around,

03:37:11.571 --> 03:37:14.744
looks towards you, goes, "All right.

03:37:15.980 --> 03:37:18.100
"You ready to go see some crazy shit?"

03:37:18.100 --> 03:37:19.661
(laughter)

03:37:19.661 --> 03:37:22.513
LIAM: That sounded so fucking crazy coming out

03:37:22.513 --> 03:37:24.340
of your mouth right now.

03:37:24.340 --> 03:37:25.899
(laughter)

03:37:25.899 --> 03:37:27.850
TRAVIS: Yes, yes!
SAM: Yes, let's do it!

03:37:27.850 --> 03:37:28.931
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
TALIESIN: When you put it that way.

03:37:28.931 --> 03:37:30.841
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

03:37:31.701 --> 03:37:33.231
MATT: "First half payment up front."

03:37:33.231 --> 03:37:36.410
SAM: Oh! Oh, how much was it again?

03:37:36.410 --> 03:37:38.451
MATT: That would be--

03:37:38.451 --> 03:37:39.711
LIAM: Oh, boy.
SAM: 25,000?

03:37:39.711 --> 03:37:40.764
LIAM: This could be real bad.

03:37:40.764 --> 03:37:43.054
MATT: "1,000 gold up front."
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:37:43.054 --> 03:37:45.052
MATT: "2,000 upon completion."

03:37:46.127 --> 03:37:47.101
TRAVIS: Yep.
TALIESIN: We can do that.

03:37:47.101 --> 03:37:48.491
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:37:48.491 --> 03:37:50.131
SAM: Sure, sure.
LIAM: I mean, I can't do that,

03:37:50.131 --> 03:37:52.414
but some of you can.
SAM: Stab 'em in the throat!

03:37:52.414 --> 03:37:54.030
(laughter)

03:37:54.030 --> 03:37:55.288
TALIESIN: How much are you doing?

03:37:57.531 --> 03:37:59.793
TRAVIS: I have--
LAURA: I don't have--

03:37:59.793 --> 03:38:00.971
SAM: I can, yeah.
LIAM: I'm broke.

03:38:00.971 --> 03:38:02.523
LAURA: I can put in a couple hundred.

03:38:02.523 --> 03:38:03.803
MARISHA: I'll throw in 500.

03:38:03.803 --> 03:38:05.041
TALIESIN: I'll throw in the other 500.

03:38:05.041 --> 03:38:07.271
MARISHA: All right, done and done with Caduceus and me.

03:38:07.271 --> 03:38:08.121
MATT: He takes the coins.

03:38:08.121 --> 03:38:09.921
He tucks them into one of his numerous pouches

03:38:09.921 --> 03:38:13.431
in the back of the chair and goes, "All right.

03:38:13.431 --> 03:38:16.511
"Come on, before it gets too cold," and he wheels around

03:38:16.511 --> 03:38:17.771
and starts heading towards the gate.

03:38:17.771 --> 03:38:20.231
You can see the guards on the side

03:38:20.231 --> 03:38:24.921
begin to step back, and slowly, the heavy, creaking sound

03:38:24.921 --> 03:38:29.921
and impact (creaking), grinding noise,

03:38:30.501 --> 03:38:33.561
as the gates open and push into the dirt and snow,

03:38:33.561 --> 03:38:35.671
and there beyond, you can see the cold,

03:38:35.671 --> 03:38:37.981
white and blue horizon

03:38:37.981 --> 03:38:41.961
of the rest of Eiselcross awaiting you.

03:38:41.961 --> 03:38:44.892
LAURA: I have a bad feeling about this.

03:38:44.892 --> 03:38:46.111
TRAVIS: Nice.

03:38:46.111 --> 03:38:47.394
MATT: As you step through the gates,

03:38:47.394 --> 03:38:50.691
the snow hitting your face,

03:38:50.691 --> 03:38:55.224
the bursts of freezing cold wind biting through,

03:38:56.274 --> 03:38:58.432
(inhales, exhales)

03:38:58.432 --> 03:39:01.332
you take a deep breath,

03:39:01.332 --> 03:39:04.131
itself very plainly visible as it escapes

03:39:04.131 --> 03:39:08.584
from between your teeth, and make your way north.

03:39:09.661 --> 03:39:11.939
That's where we going to end tonight's session.

03:39:11.939 --> 03:39:14.161
Pick up next episode.

03:39:14.161 --> 03:39:17.001
TRAVIS: This has been a fucking roller coaster.

03:39:17.001 --> 03:39:19.511
LIAM: Caleb clutches the secretary of state

03:39:19.511 --> 03:39:20.533
in his necklace.

03:39:20.533 --> 03:39:22.002
(laughter)

03:39:22.002 --> 03:39:23.621
LIAM: And just walks out into the snow. (laughs)

03:39:23.621 --> 03:39:25.001
TRAVIS: What did you do?

03:39:25.001 --> 03:39:28.241
What did you make, and then you let it die?

03:39:28.241 --> 03:39:29.074
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

03:39:29.074 --> 03:39:30.211
(laughter)

03:39:30.211 --> 03:39:31.634
LIAM: You're Taliesin!

03:39:31.634 --> 03:39:34.751
MARISHA: True, you made a nuke, and then you died,

03:39:34.751 --> 03:39:36.271
and you left the nuke in the middle

03:39:36.271 --> 03:39:38.016
of a field somewhere.
TALIESIN: It's everything I ever wanted.

03:39:38.016 --> 03:39:39.514
TRAVIS: You didn't tell anybody?!

03:39:39.514 --> 03:39:42.131
TALIESIN: I mean, I told Matt.

03:39:42.131 --> 03:39:43.039
TRAVIS: You did tell Matt.

03:39:43.039 --> 03:39:44.934
TALIESIN: I mean, not much, but, you know.

03:39:45.901 --> 03:39:47.625
MATT: He doesn't know.
MARISHA: If Beau would've died--

03:39:47.625 --> 03:39:49.231
LAURA: (laughs) He doesn't.

03:39:49.231 --> 03:39:51.188
MATT: He has no idea.
TALIESIN: I have no fucking clue.

03:39:51.188 --> 03:39:53.350
Very specifically, I have no clue.

03:39:53.350 --> 03:39:55.351
TRAVIS: Very specifically!
MATT: He gave me a blank slate.

03:39:55.351 --> 03:39:56.244
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, okay.

03:39:56.244 --> 03:39:59.124
LIAM: Yeah. You get real Eddie Izzard vibes, though.
TALIESIN: Here are the clues to it.

03:39:59.124 --> 03:40:00.211
I don't know what I'm going to find.

03:40:00.211 --> 03:40:02.486
LIAM: I'm getting Eddie Izzard vibes with the--

03:40:04.342 --> 03:40:06.452
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: Straight up, straight up.

03:40:07.561 --> 03:40:09.227
(groans)
TRAVIS: A miner, not a minor.

03:40:09.227 --> 03:40:10.433
TRAVIS and LIAM: A miner.

03:40:10.433 --> 03:40:11.961
MATT: (cackles)

03:40:11.961 --> 03:40:14.320
TRAVIS: We really should've done a better job of protecting.

03:40:14.320 --> 03:40:16.771
MATT: Nah, it's all good.
MARISHA: I'm so mad

03:40:16.771 --> 03:40:17.604
that I was sitting here, being like,

03:40:17.604 --> 03:40:19.321
"What does it all mean?"

03:40:19.321 --> 03:40:21.497
And he was, like, "It means he's upstairs."
LAURA: I mean, she probably would've been dead.

03:40:21.497 --> 03:40:23.781
She probably, even if we had gone upstairs.
TALIESIN: 25 feet away.

03:40:23.781 --> 03:40:26.649
MARISHA: It means he's 25 feet away is what it meant.

03:40:26.649 --> 03:40:27.891
LIAM: He'd already fucking done it

03:40:27.891 --> 03:40:29.671
by the time you started talking to him.

03:40:29.671 --> 03:40:31.452
He'd already done it.
LAURA: Who knows?

03:40:31.452 --> 03:40:32.971
She could've been dead for, you know,

03:40:32.971 --> 03:40:35.151
an hour when I scryed on him.

03:40:35.151 --> 03:40:38.301
TRAVIS: Maybe that wasn't her at dinner at all.

03:40:38.301 --> 03:40:39.251
SAM: We don't know.

03:40:39.251 --> 03:40:40.161
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: It's true.

03:40:40.161 --> 03:40:43.533
SAM: All I know is I want to read the poem.

03:40:43.533 --> 03:40:45.608
MATT: Right?
(laughter)

03:40:45.608 --> 03:40:48.681
TALIESIN: Actually, she would've known that there was

03:40:48.681 --> 03:40:52.911
an account, so the offer to pay for dinner

03:40:52.911 --> 03:40:54.791
wouldn't have--
LAURA: (gasps)

03:40:54.791 --> 03:40:57.778
TALIESIN: I mean, in what world would she not have gone,

03:40:57.778 --> 03:40:59.641
"There is no paid dinner."
LAURA: You're right.

03:40:59.641 --> 03:41:02.501
It was Molly all along.
ASHLEY: (gasps)

03:41:02.501 --> 03:41:03.924
LAURA: <i>Lucien</i> all along.

03:41:04.861 --> 03:41:05.951
TALIESIN: It's an interesting theory.

03:41:05.951 --> 03:41:07.209
TRAVIS: We're grasping at everything.
TALIESIN: I'm just going to put that out there.

03:41:07.209 --> 03:41:09.034
MATT: Yes, you are. But nevertheless.

03:41:09.034 --> 03:41:11.481
SAM: Wait, he ate vegetables!

03:41:11.481 --> 03:41:13.337
Like Molly did!

03:41:13.337 --> 03:41:16.337
(laughter)

03:41:17.621 --> 03:41:20.406
LAURA: She grabbed a bottle of wine like Molly did.

03:41:20.406 --> 03:41:22.841
SAM: Oh, shit! She's Molly.
TRAVIS: The fuck.

03:41:22.841 --> 03:41:25.916
If we'd just walked her back to her room, man.

03:41:26.999 --> 03:41:27.911
TALIESIN: Lucien basically did

03:41:27.911 --> 03:41:30.171
the exact same thing we just did.

03:41:30.171 --> 03:41:31.371
I mean, I'm just pointing that out,

03:41:31.371 --> 03:41:32.671
that it was, like--

03:41:32.671 --> 03:41:35.071
the worst thing is we're "Weekend at Bernie's 2."

03:41:35.071 --> 03:41:37.859
We're not even the original "Weekend at Bernie's."

03:41:37.859 --> 03:41:38.810
LIAM: Very cool.

03:41:38.810 --> 03:41:40.828
MATT: We'll have to put together
a proper soundtrack for you.

03:41:40.828 --> 03:41:42.928
TRAVIS: Did he watch us land at the dock

03:41:42.928 --> 03:41:43.826
and come into the fort,

03:41:43.826 --> 03:41:45.491
and was just tracking us the whole time

03:41:45.491 --> 03:41:47.208
from when we landed at port?

03:41:47.208 --> 03:41:49.161
ASHLEY and LAURA: Probably.

03:41:49.161 --> 03:41:52.141
TALIESIN: No one knew about a purple-- I don't know.

03:41:52.141 --> 03:41:53.779
TRAVIS: We asked.
TALIESIN: We asked around a little bit.

03:41:53.779 --> 03:41:55.087
LAURA: He could've been in disguise the whole time.

03:41:55.087 --> 03:41:57.851
LIAM: We don't know who or what he really is,

03:41:57.851 --> 03:41:59.509
what his abilities are.
TRAVIS: Yeah, and he's with--

03:41:59.509 --> 03:42:01.836
TALIESIN: Are we recording? I don't even know anymore.

03:42:01.836 --> 03:42:03.251
TRAVIS: Black cat.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:42:03.251 --> 03:42:05.109
LAURA: But he did see me scrying.

03:42:05.109 --> 03:42:07.109
TALIESIN: Oh my god.
SAM: Save it for "Talks," guys,

03:42:07.109 --> 03:42:08.101
save it for "Talks!"
MATT: Indeed!

03:42:08.101 --> 03:42:10.131
LIAM: We're throwing illusions around.

03:42:10.131 --> 03:42:13.089
MATT: Nevertheless, welcome to Eiselcross, motherfuckers.

03:42:13.089 --> 03:42:15.701
(cheering)

03:42:15.701 --> 03:42:17.481
MATT: Thank you for joining us.

03:42:17.481 --> 03:42:20.325
Very, very happy Halloween to all of you.

03:42:20.325 --> 03:42:21.401
ALL: Yeah!

03:42:21.401 --> 03:42:26.065
MATT: We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

03:42:26.065 --> 03:42:27.113
Good night! (smacking)
(howling)

03:42:27.113 --> 03:42:30.377
MARISHA: Okay, House Red!

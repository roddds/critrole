00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.337
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.240
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.764
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:09.859
MARISHA: Yeah, we do!

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:18.500
MATT: Yeah, okay. Before we get started, we want
to give a nice thank you and talk a little bit

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.884
about our fantastic sponsor for Campaign Two since
the very beginning: our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam?

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:34.779
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, everybody. If you're just joining
us, you might not remember this, but I love D&amp;D

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:39.167
Beyond so much. I love the app, I love the
platform, I love the company, I love the people. I

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:44.683
love it so much that I want to be in control of
it, and run the company, which is why I'm running

00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:50.426
for president of D&amp;D Beyond. I launched my
campaign a month or two ago. It's going great.

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:56.518
Lots of fundraising. I'm waiting for donations
from you guys.

00:00:57.848 --> 00:00:59.140
TRAVIS: It's in process.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.920
SAM: That's what those envelopes were that I
slipped under your chairs.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.955
ALL: Oh.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:07.021
MARISHA: Thought that was a parking ticket.

00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:14.493
SAM: Those are not tax-deductible. I'm pleased to
announce today that I have an opponent. A big part

00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:19.478
of running for office is to have an opponent and
to know who you're facing. A lot of nominations

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:24.260
came in, a lot of suggestions. Some people
couldn't do it. Marisha was actually technically

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:33.656
too young to run. Taliesin, not a citizen of the
United States. Also not sure where he is a citizen of.

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.089
TALIESIN: It's a country that doesn't exist
anymore.

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:45.303
SAM: Yep, that's about right. Travis didn't pass the
IQ test. So what we're left with was the opponent

00:01:45.303 --> 00:01:51.105
that will be running against me for the presidency
of D&amp;D Beyond is: (drumroll)

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:53.212
TRAVIS: Oh, is that a drumroll?

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:55.356
SAM: Liam O'Brien!

00:01:55.356 --> 00:01:57.288
LIAM: Oh, man.

00:01:57.288 --> 00:02:01.333
SAM: We're friends, so I hope we run a respectful
campaign.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.029
LIAM: The word is frenemies.

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:11.274
SAM: Yeah. I'm going to do my best to not-- the
problem here is that I'm sort of a master of

00:02:11.274 --> 00:02:16.694
media. I'm politically savvy. The people love me.
I've been doing this for a while. I got Dani Carr

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:21.931
as my campaign manager. I've got it going on. So I
don't know what you've got in store for this

00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:28.280
campaign, but it's not going to be all that. But
whatever. I'll give you the floor. Let's see what you got.

00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:36.294
LIAM: Well, all I can say is thank fuck for a
two-party system. Sam Riegel, you're adorable.

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:41.064
You're quick-witted. You're clever. You're good in
bed, but this is the adults' table. Roll the

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:42.572
motherfucking clip!

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:47.357
NARRATOR: (VO) And now a message from Liam
O'Brien.

00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:56.121
LIAM: My fellow tabletoppers, I am coming to you
in these dark times to bring sense and reason to

00:02:56.121 --> 00:03:03.100
the table. For too long has our great game been
sliding into a lugubrious den of iniquity,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.691
malfeasance, and ineptitude. We live in a world
where any Tom, Dick, and Harry can come waltzing

00:03:09.691 --> 00:03:15.425
into the hallowed halls of both dungeons and
dragons with half-baked backstories and Cockney

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:21.342
accents in hand, and run roughshod over the
time-honored traditions of fantasy make-believe.

00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:29.922
My opponent in the race to be president of D&amp;D
Beyond has relied too long on charm, quick

00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:37.233
thinking, creative character choices, and that
cartoonishly large parasail he calls a smile.

00:03:38.063 --> 00:03:44.601
Sure, he and his compatriots have peddled you a
steady stream of things like heart, humor, complex

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:52.844
exploration of the human condition, and the
playing of roles in this role-playing game. But at

00:03:52.844 --> 00:04:04.112
what cost? At. What. Cost. As your next president
of D&amp;D Beyond, I am running on a platform of

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:14.396
accountability, on the rule of law, and the law of
the rules. I promise a new era of gravity and

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:21.983
honor. No longer will Hunter's Mark be mismanaged.
Rages will be raged when it is indeed time to

00:04:21.983 --> 00:04:28.839
rage, whether you'd like to or no. And so help me
Larkin, every rogue will know precisely when and

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:36.551
how to implement the assassinate feature. Enough
is enough. My opponent would have you believe that

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:45.201
D&amp;D is about story, adventure, magic and wonder.
Don't you believe it, my friends. Don't you

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:54.720
believe it. With me as your next president, we
will rediscover the true joy of gaming: systemic

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:09.712
memorization. To d4, or not to d4: that is the
question. Thank you, and gods bless D&amp;D Beyond.

00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:16.617
(VO) I'm Sam Riegel's husband and I approve this
message.

00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:22.281
TRAVIS: Oh, wow. I mean, that's just--

00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:24.752
LIAM: I leave it up to the people to decide.

00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:29.903
SAM: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
I don't have a video, I don't have a logo. I don't

00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:35.406
have American flags behind me, or wheat fields, or
whatever that shit was. Dani, what are you doing

00:05:35.406 --> 00:05:42.180
to me?! We need a video! Ooh, you're going down.
Do you remember what I said about a respectful

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.531
campaign? Fuck that, the gloves are off,
motherfucker, you're going down. I will rule D&amp;D

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.430
Beyond! Back to you, Matt.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.363
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Liam.

00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:56.128
LIAM: We'll settle it in the bedroom.

00:05:56.418 --> 00:06:02.436
MATT: And thank you, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.
Next announcement. Those who haven't seen The

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:08.111
Search for Grog, our special Vox Machina one-shot
from our live show in LA, will air tomorrow night.

00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:13.724
So tune in to the Critical Role Twitch channel at
7:00 pm Pacific to watch it. If you miss the live

00:06:13.724 --> 00:06:19.948
broadcast, you can check out the VOD on Saturday
at youtube.com/criticalrole. Travis, you've got

00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:22.124
something-- Not Travis, Laura, actually.

00:06:22.124 --> 00:06:23.808
LAURA: Hi, I'm Laura!

00:06:23.808 --> 00:06:26.677
MATT: That's you! You're Laura. You're Travis.

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:34.222
LAURA: So just a reminder, the preorders for our
amazing Mighty Nein and Vox Machina art prints,

00:06:34.222 --> 00:06:42.307
those end tonight at 11:59. That's signed and
unsigned, go to the store if you want them because

00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:48.803
once they're gone, they're gone. Also, speaking of
once they're gone, they're gone: I've got one more

00:06:48.803 --> 00:06:51.296
thing that I want to tell you about. Which is--

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:52.883
LIAM: Witches.

00:06:54.843 --> 00:07:00.585
LAURA: So at our live show for The Search for
Grog, we had posters for sale for The Search for

00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:05.580
Grog. And we thought we sold out of them but then
we found an extra box, so we're putting them

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.462
in the store.

00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:08.690
SAM: Oh cool!

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.354
LAURA: These are in the store right now. There's
not a whole lot of them, so if you grab one, go to

00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:17.693
the store right now and you can find them. Once
they're gone, they're gone for real, because

00:07:17.693 --> 00:07:18.487
there's no more.

00:07:18.487 --> 00:07:20.128
SAM: I don't have one of those!

00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:21.873
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Ed!

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:25.065
LAURA: We will grab some out of the box before
they go to the store.

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:28.625
SAM: No, the people need them more than us. We can
photocopy, it's fine.

00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:30.903
TALIESIN: I have a need.

00:07:30.903 --> 00:07:36.213
LAURA: So yeah, in honor of The Search for
Grog. That's my announcement. Travis!

00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:37.742
Do you have an announcement?

00:07:37.742 --> 00:07:39.070
MATT: There, Travis--

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.710
LAURA: Oh! I should say, though, I should
definitely say the art is by Hugo--

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.572
LIAM: @takayuuki_art

00:07:44.572 --> 00:07:52.585
LAURA: @takayuuki_art, and it's so beautiful, I'm
not showing-- Okay, I'm stopping. Get away from

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:54.276
me, camera. Travis?

00:07:54.526 --> 00:08:01.607
TRAVIS: Yes, right. So we dropped a little tease
of things to come on our Twitter and Facebook

00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:11.238
pages this morning. We were all quite blown away
by how fucking fast you solved our little puzzle.

00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:18.527
Especially @TimothyGElsy on Twitter, who was the
first to crack the code. He made M.I.T. proud.

00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:27.237
It's cool, DARPA's very proud of you. We have a
puzzle if you haven't seen it, it should be up. We

00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:34.315
are excited to announce tonight that on March 4th,
we are launching a Kickstarter project to create

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:38.484
our very own Vox Machina animated special.

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:42.185
(cheering)

00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:47.507
TRAVIS: Just let it sink in. Let it sink into your
body. Let it get in through your skin and your

00:08:47.507 --> 00:08:56.370
meat and your bones. There will be more details to
share leading up to launch day, but since you

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.736
cracked it so fast we just had to let y'all know
what's going down. So get hype. (singing) Get

00:09:01.736 --> 00:09:04.264
hype. Get hype.

00:09:04.264 --> 00:09:06.479
MARISHA: Animated. An-animated.

00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:12.476
TRAVIS: I do it for cartoons, I dance for
cartoons.

00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:15.101
MARISHA: (laughing) Dance for cartoons!

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:21.184
MATT: I know what I'm getting you for every day,
ever. Thank you, Travis. As you guys may have

00:09:21.184 --> 00:09:25.808
noticed, we do have a new Twitch overlay that we
unveiled tonight. We wanted to spruce things up a

00:09:25.808 --> 00:09:30.371
bit and we hope that you love it as much as we do,
for all the work we did on it. Little changes,

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:34.938
little aesthetic changes. We're also working on a
few special things to enhance your live-viewing

00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:40.216
experience that we'll share more about that just
as soon as we can. Some cool optional bells and

00:09:40.216 --> 00:09:47.653
whistles and we'll roll it out as we get the
opportunity. An important update, starting this

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:51.933
week with episode 52-- which you're seeing
tonight-- Critical Role will air on the Critical

00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:56.506
Role Twitch channel with the VOD available for
Critical Role Twitch channel subscribers over the

00:09:56.506 --> 00:10:00.810
weekend. VOD will also be available on the
critical role YouTube channels on Mondays at

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.640
12:00pm Pacific. Talks Machina will also air on
the official Critical Role channels moving

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.314
forward. Geek &amp; Sundry's Twitch channel will still
host Critical Role and Talks Machina episodes on

00:10:10.314 --> 00:10:15.034
Tuesday and Thursday nights so you can continue to
watch there if that's where you're subscribed. We

00:10:15.034 --> 00:10:19.263
just wanted to take a moment to thank all the
folks at Geek &amp; Sundry and Legendary Digital

00:10:19.263 --> 00:10:23.928
Networks for a long and successful partnership and
we wish them the absolute best. Be sure to check

00:10:23.928 --> 00:10:29.922
out critrole.com for all the details.
And I believe that is the end of

00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:32.041
our announcements for the evening.

00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:34.658
LIAM: Do we still get to play D&amp;D on this show?!

00:10:34.658 --> 00:10:37.891
MATT: (goofy voice) Uh, Liam? I believe that's
what we're doing next.

00:10:37.891 --> 00:10:38.759
LIAM: Yay!

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:46.012
MATT: And on that note, let's go ahead and dive
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:10:48.452 --> 00:10:50.667
[water bubbling]

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:56.063
[thunder]

00:10:56.063 --> 00:10:58.123
[explosion]

00:10:58.123 --> 00:11:02.327
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:11:02.327 --> 00:11:10.034
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:11:10.034 --> 00:11:19.880
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:27.510
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.454
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:11:35.617 --> 00:11:41.056
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:11:41.056 --> 00:11:49.063
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:11:49.063 --> 00:11:52.253
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:11:52.723 --> 00:11:59.720
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.110
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:15.719
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:24.064
[fire burning]

00:12:24.394 --> 00:12:29.513
(laughter)

00:12:30.093 --> 00:12:31.049
MATT: What?!

00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:32.858
TRAVIS: It's the balance of rational--

00:12:32.858 --> 00:12:35.221
LIAM: I just tied-in a job I had earlier today.

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:36.209
MATT: Okay!

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:37.452
TALIESIN: I was with you.

00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:48.250
MATT: Welcome back! Welcome back. So, last we left
off, The Mighty Nein, in search of Nott's

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:57.739
kidnapped husband had made their way east beneath
the Marrow Valley, skirting the Underdark, under

00:12:57.739 --> 00:13:05.194
the Ashkeeper Peaks and have emerged into the
ashen wastes of Xhorhas. You came in contact with

00:13:05.194 --> 00:13:13.322
one of the roving scout regiments of the empire
who were immediately assaulted by a roving crew of

00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:20.012
assassins and hunters made of gnolls and a Kryn
warrior and some sort of a mage using a new form

00:13:20.012 --> 00:13:26.209
of magic you've never seen before. You engaged in
the battle, and after some blows were tossed back

00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:32.488
and forth the enemies-- at least the ones with
enough strength to survive the encounter-- fled

00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:38.954
when it seemed like it was not turning in their
favor. Left behind, you got some materials from

00:13:38.954 --> 00:13:48.354
the survivors of the imperial scouting troop and
made your way through the wastes eastward. Along

00:13:48.354 --> 00:13:53.778
that way, you began to encounter some of the
distant strange beasts that wander these lands.

00:13:53.778 --> 00:14:03.500
You endured the heavy rains and were suddenly
hunted by a large, somewhat unwell, roc-- a

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.555
massive bird that you thought was sweeping towards
you, but instead seemed to be hunting a troop of

00:14:08.555 --> 00:14:14.828
bugbear hunters <i>and</i> you. Through some clever use
of illusionary magic and some decent stealth

00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:20.110
rolls, you managed to avoid getting involved in
that fray and instead came upon the mostly torn

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.754
apart troop of bugbears with one survivor who had
been playing possum. Noticing that he was still

00:14:24.754 --> 00:14:31.609
breathing, you decided to have a conversation
where you came to an understanding which involved:

00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:37.370
we're not going to kill you, give us some
information, and maybe let me tattoo your body.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:45.777
Jester shaved a portion of his furry form and
tattooed him with a classic Tusktooth special.

00:14:49.357 --> 00:14:57.544
You guys made it across the Ifolon River through
some clever Moses-like parting of the waters...

00:15:00.256 --> 00:15:01.945
and some good rope work. I'm sorry.

00:15:02.141 --> 00:15:03.764
TRAVIS: You don't need to do that.

00:15:03.764 --> 00:15:06.282
LIAM: That's a mage in Rexxentrum.

00:15:06.512 --> 00:15:16.701
MATT: Yeah. As the last evening began to come to a
close, you could see the distant fire light of

00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:24.581
what you've now been informed to be Asarius, the
City of Beasts, and the home to this bugbear Gluzzo

00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:33.288
you had encountered. Camping up for the night,
this far out of the vicinity, you found yourselves

00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:43.263
sleeping protected underneath Caleb's dome, your
hut, and prepared yourself for a morning journey

00:15:43.263 --> 00:15:53.503
wherever you see fit. That's where we left off.
So, Mighty Nein, waking from the evening's rest,

00:15:53.503 --> 00:16:00.361
to the gentle rainfall from the clouded morning
skies, a cold air chilling the surrounding mud.

00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:05.957
You glance around the gray field dotted with
clusters of leafless trees and brush and look to

00:16:05.957 --> 00:16:10.062
the nearby city of Asarius. What would you like
to do?

00:16:11.532 --> 00:16:15.104
TRAVIS: When he doesn't start with, "What do you
want to do," I get nervous!

00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:19.286
SAM: I know! What do we want to, I have no idea
what we want to do!

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:21.867
TALIESIN: Has our bugbear friend already
taken off?

00:16:21.867 --> 00:16:28.864
MATT: The heavy snoring, and somewhat sore
movement of his body once he gently comes to

00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:35.143
consciousness, belays the recovery period from the
encounter the day before. He has not left.

00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:39.619
LAURA: Hello, Gluzzo.

00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:43.572
MATT: "Hello to you, too."

00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:46.258
LAURA: Good morning.

00:16:46.998 --> 00:16:48.562
MATT: "Good morning."

00:16:48.562 --> 00:16:54.856
SAM: Doesn't he have to rewrap the tattoo every day
or something for infections?

00:16:54.856 --> 00:16:56.614
MARISHA: A little bit of coconut oil.

00:16:56.614 --> 00:16:57.581
TRAVIS: Aquaphor.

00:16:57.581 --> 00:17:04.024
LAURA: Oh really? I haven't told anyone to do
that. I mean, I've never gotten a tattoo,

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:05.390
I've only given them.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.786
SAM: You don't have <i>any</i> tattoos?

00:17:07.786 --> 00:17:08.494
LAURA: No.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.356
TRAVIS: You never practice on yourself?

00:17:10.356 --> 00:17:13.319
LAURA: No, why would I do that? I have other
people, you know?

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.747
MATT: "It's all right. You treat it like any other
wound." He grabs some mud and dirt from the

00:17:17.747 --> 00:17:19.698
ground, and jams it into the space there.

00:17:19.698 --> 00:17:21.275
LAURA: Yeah, see? Just like that.

00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:23.034
(groans and pained reactions)

00:17:23.034 --> 00:17:27.599
TALIESIN: I'm going to get some breakfast going,
we'll have a moment, we'll fill our bellies, and

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.745
then we'll figure out what we're going to do.

00:17:31.295 --> 00:17:36.211
SAM: The conundrum at hand is that some of us
don't look like monsters, right?

00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:41.198
TRAVIS: Yeah, that is a problem, apparently. How
do we fix that?

00:17:41.198 --> 00:17:47.219
LIAM: It will be slow going, I don't think we can
do anything that will last more than a short

00:17:47.219 --> 00:17:51.626
while. I can change my own appearance. I can
change Beauregard's appearance.

00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:53.665
MARISHA and SAM: You can?

00:17:53.665 --> 00:17:57.059
LIAM: Yeah, I know how to. Roughly an hour of time.

00:17:57.059 --> 00:18:00.371
MARISHA: Wait, you're telling me this <i>now</i>?!

00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:02.251
SAM: Is this a new ability?

00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:03.381
TRAVIS: I think so.

00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.013
LAURA: Yes, it is!

00:18:06.313 --> 00:18:10.666
SAM: He's always learning and growing as a wizard!
It's what I love about him most.

00:18:10.666 --> 00:18:13.710
LAURA: How did you even find this one? That's
really cool, Caleb!

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.278
MARISHA: How long have you known?

00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:16.399
LIAM: Not long at all.

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:19.269
TALIESIN: It still baffles me that anyone
can't do this.

00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:26.868
LIAM: I have been working on it, because, you
know, what you are hoping for.

00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:31.026
LAURA: Like what? To changing back and stuff?

00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:35.648
SAM: I mean, we hadn't had a talk about it, so I
didn't know if that was something that was on

00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:39.798
your, whatever the ancient equivalent of
radar is.

00:18:39.798 --> 00:18:43.375
(laughter)

00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:51.045
SAM: I didn't know that you were aware. I mean, I
don't want to stand in the way of your growth and

00:18:51.045 --> 00:19:02.769
journey and your path. I mean, if you stumbled
upon a way to, you know, make me whole again,

00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:05.165
I wouldn't say no to it.

00:19:05.165 --> 00:19:10.789
LIAM: You know that my main focus is on
transmutation, and changing one thing from

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:17.857
another, so it's not totally out of the realm of
sense for me to have been working on such a thing.

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:22.255
What I'm able to do is limited. It's not what you
want, but it's a start.

00:19:22.255 --> 00:19:23.898
MARISHA: How long does it last?

00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:26.050
LIAM: Roughly an hour.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.154
TRAVIS: Same for me. I can re-up it every once in
a while.

00:19:30.154 --> 00:19:35.113
TALIESIN: I think you look just fine. That's the
sense I get.

00:19:35.113 --> 00:19:36.471
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:40.595
MATT: You look over at Gluzzo and he's not even
paying attention to the conversation.

00:19:40.595 --> 00:19:43.930
TALIESIN: (louder) That's the sense I get.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.906
MATT: "What's the-- What?"

00:19:45.906 --> 00:19:53.418
TALIESIN: I was wondering, our friend here, Mr.
Fjord, is probably going to be, not necessarily

00:19:53.418 --> 00:19:59.672
welcomed with open arms, but he's not going to
draw any odd glances or anything in this town of yours?

00:19:59.672 --> 00:20:04.331
MATT: "He's tiny for an orc, but he should be
okay."

00:20:04.331 --> 00:20:06.551
TRAVIS: No, no, I've worked out. I have--

00:20:06.551 --> 00:20:09.062
LAURA: You're very big. You're very large
and stuff.

00:20:09.062 --> 00:20:10.318
TALIESIN: Fun-sized.

00:20:10.661 --> 00:20:12.007
MATT: "He's pretty small."

00:20:12.977 --> 00:20:15.456
LAURA: I think it's a really good size that you
have.

00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:18.319
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll make myself a little bit
larger.

00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:22.712
MARISHA: Maybe you do seem bigger when you're on a
ship, an enclosed area.

00:20:22.712 --> 00:20:24.392
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:20:24.392 --> 00:20:27.420
LIAM: Where do you clock in, about 6'1" or--?

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:33.090
TRAVIS: Yeah, ish. Okay. Let's stop talking about
me. Maybe, if we figure out exactly what we need

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.428
in the city, we'll understand how long we actually
need to be in there.

00:20:36.428 --> 00:20:40.852
SAM: We need to go into the city to get some sort
of conveyance, right? Some sort of animal or

00:20:40.852 --> 00:20:43.282
vehicle to take us further in our journey.

00:20:43.282 --> 00:20:46.933
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that'd make it faster. Otherwise
it's, what, two weeks?

00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:48.366
LAURA: It's a long time, yeah.

00:20:48.366 --> 00:20:49.409
TRAVIS: Boy. Yeah.

00:20:50.989 --> 00:20:54.616
SAM: Do we need anything else? Weapons? Allies?

00:20:54.616 --> 00:20:56.498
LAURA: Just go shopping. Books, maybe.

00:20:56.498 --> 00:20:58.546
SAM: Would they have books in monster land?

00:20:58.546 --> 00:20:59.976
LAURA: Some dresses and stuff.

00:21:00.396 --> 00:21:01.468
LIAM: Dresses?

00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:06.401
LAURA: Well, I like dresses. I thought we could
look for some. I bet the ones here look a lot

00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:10.439
different than the ones in Nicodranas, so I
thought it could be fun to go shopping.

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:17.469
LIAM: Undoubtedly, but we are going to need to
pick our moments for adjusting Beauregard and

00:21:17.469 --> 00:21:23.071
Yasha's appearance. It's not game on all day, like
we're in Zadash where we can go shopping for

00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:28.451
things. If we see something, if it presents
itself, then we could, but we need to be careful.

00:21:28.451 --> 00:21:32.724
TRAVIS: We do have manacles. We could make them
our prisoner.

00:21:35.714 --> 00:21:38.173
LAURA: That might attract attention, though.

00:21:39.153 --> 00:21:42.709
SAM: We could throw a bag over someone's head and
drag them into an alley--

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:44.553
TRAVIS: Punch them every once in a while.

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.697
MARISHA: I'm standing right here!

00:21:46.697 --> 00:21:52.758
LAURA: Well, Caleb, you can disguise yourself and
Beau, and I could technically disguise Yasha.

00:21:53.628 --> 00:21:55.818
I mean, I think I could.

00:21:55.818 --> 00:21:56.855
SAM: You can?

00:21:56.855 --> 00:22:02.674
LAURA: Well, I can change something into another
animal, so I can't imagine I can't change her into

00:22:02.674 --> 00:22:05.507
another person, do you think?

00:22:05.507 --> 00:22:06.920
TRAVIS: How long does that last?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.621
LAURA and LIAM: Roughly an hour.

00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:16.106
MATT: That's Polymorph. It's an hour. I mean,
yeah, you can do that.

00:22:16.296 --> 00:22:17.353
LAURA: Is it weird?

00:22:17.353 --> 00:22:21.671
MATT: It's not weird. Polymorph is, you can turn
into anything, so if you want to turn into a

00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:24.950
different person? Totally, by all means.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.655
TALIESIN: It's a bazooka, is what he's saying.

00:22:26.655 --> 00:22:30.560
TRAVIS: Use the thing that can make you a dragon
into somebody who looks different.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.366
MATT: Yeah, basically. Yeah, totally.

00:22:32.466 --> 00:22:36.336
SAM: Does Yasha-- Yasha? Who's Yasha today?

00:22:36.336 --> 00:22:38.999
MATT: She's still laying down and looking up at
the sky.

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:40.889
SAM: Do you fit in here?

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:48.968
MATT: "I haven't been this far north, but I mean,
if someone gets in my face, I'll punch them."

00:22:49.988 --> 00:22:55.271
TALIESIN: If we were going to Polymorph anybody, I
would recommend Mr. Caleb, since I imagine we

00:22:55.271 --> 00:23:02.242
would want physical people to feel comfortable in
themselves. I guess a lot of you is up here?

00:23:04.802 --> 00:23:10.732
LIAM: It's basically all up there. I was thinking
that I would change my appearance.

00:23:10.732 --> 00:23:13.590
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair too. That's probably a
better plan.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.067
LIAM: Yeah, and you could be whatever you want to
be.

00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:21.418
MARISHA: Does it change my clothes? I feel like my
blue vestiges really say Empire.

00:23:21.418 --> 00:23:25.523
LIAM: I can change your entire appearance and your
physical being for roughly one hour.

00:23:25.523 --> 00:23:26.717
MARISHA: Dope.

00:23:26.887 --> 00:23:33.079
TRAVIS: Gluzzo, are there any codewords or sayings
in your city? Any greetings or things that people

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:36.085
exchange that would be familiar to someone that
lives there?

00:23:37.545 --> 00:23:40.660
MATT: "Not really. It's more of a heavy grunt."

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.343
TRAVIS: A heavy grunt?

00:23:42.423 --> 00:23:43.567
TALIESIN: (grunt)

00:23:43.567 --> 00:23:44.589
MATT: (grunt)

00:23:44.719 --> 00:23:47.760
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (grunting back and forth)

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.349
MATT: "That's not too bad. That'll probably work
for some people, yeah."

00:23:52.529 --> 00:23:57.957
TRAVIS: Having been in the city so long, anything
ever make outsiders very obvious to your eye, or

00:23:57.957 --> 00:23:59.781
ear, when they come in?

00:24:02.411 --> 00:24:08.595
MATT: "I don't really look out for the outsiders.
I go out and hunt things, and bring them back, and

00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:12.265
"work for my boss. That's about it."

00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:16.226
TALIESIN: We're hoping to go in, do a little
commerce, and get out without causing a

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:17.438
ruckus, is all.

00:24:17.438 --> 00:24:19.326
MATT: "Then don't cause a ruckus."

00:24:19.396 --> 00:24:28.556
TALIESIN: Then if they see human-ish people-ish,
how big of a problem, if we do run into something,

00:24:28.556 --> 00:24:31.828
do you think that'd be? That's fair.

00:24:32.128 --> 00:24:37.526
LIAM: We are not going to cause a ruckus. I would
ask of you, Gluzzo, are you going to cause a ruckus?

00:24:37.966 --> 00:24:40.824
MARISHA: I'm a fan of how much we're using the
word "ruckus."

00:24:40.824 --> 00:24:42.631
TALIESIN: We should get a ruckus room.

00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:51.888
MATT: "Look, I'm going to be honest. You people
have not done anything bad to me, and you don't

00:24:51.888 --> 00:25:01.307
"seem to be the typical Empire types. As long as
you don't go shouting that you're from the Empire,

00:25:01.307 --> 00:25:02.697
"maybe you'll be okay."

00:25:02.697 --> 00:25:04.586
TRAVIS: I toss him one more gold.

00:25:08.276 --> 00:25:12.837
MARISHA: Is that money bad? Is that bad money?
Does it also scream Empire?

00:25:13.607 --> 00:25:20.110
MATT: "No, I mean, gold is gold. Not everyone
takes it. A lot of the city tends to be barter for

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.388
"work, but some do take gold."

00:25:23.578 --> 00:25:30.091
LIAM: If you escort us into the city safely and
see us to the outskirts when our business is done,

00:25:30.091 --> 00:25:32.281
there will be another 20 for you.

00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:41.064
MATT: "How about this? When we get to the city, I
just never see you again."

00:25:41.064 --> 00:25:46.737
(laughter)

00:25:47.482 --> 00:25:48.379
MARISHA: Barter.

00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:54.082
LIAM: I will give you ten gold to make sure that
that happens. Just take it.

00:25:54.782 --> 00:26:04.930
MATT: "I'll take it, okay. Very good deal." He
gets up, (stretching). "Well, shall we?"

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.247
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do it.

00:26:07.317 --> 00:26:09.090
LAURA: Wait, are you going to--

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.009
TRAVIS: Transport, potions, weapons, things like
that. Maybe books, if there are such things.

00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:16.012
SAM: Should we split up or stick together?

00:26:16.012 --> 00:26:17.064
LAURA: Stick together.

00:26:17.064 --> 00:26:19.400
TRAVIS: Stick together in a totally obvious
group.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.504
SAM: Do we have any means, if we do get split up,
do we know where we're meeting? Because we don't

00:26:24.504 --> 00:26:28.929
know anything about this city. Are there any--
Gluzzo. Are there any places in the city that are

00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:32.463
easy to spot? Tower spires, anything that
we can--

00:26:32.523 --> 00:26:34.383
TALIESIN: We're right outside the city.

00:26:34.383 --> 00:26:41.703
MATT: "Well, the city's got a wall around it, and
there's watchtowers. There's the Aurora Hold in

00:26:41.703 --> 00:26:48.447
"the middle. It's the big gray tower piece. That's
where all the Kryn use as their base of operations."

00:26:48.647 --> 00:26:53.163
TALIESIN: Let's maybe meet at the wall and not the
center of the city. That seems a little--

00:26:53.163 --> 00:26:58.628
MATT: "Either way. There are places of business,
if that's what you're looking for."

00:26:58.628 --> 00:27:07.523
TRAVIS: I guess that's-- yeah. Before we leave,
does anyone want to take a, uh-huh, out?

00:27:07.523 --> 00:27:10.888
SAM: A gander at the thing?

00:27:10.888 --> 00:27:15.339
LAURA: While you guys do that, can I talk to
Gluzzo? I'm going to take the haversack off and

00:27:15.339 --> 00:27:19.205
pass it to whoever wants it. Don't take it out.

00:27:19.205 --> 00:27:20.577
SAM: No. Who wants it?

00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:21.604
LIAM: I'm holding it.

00:27:21.604 --> 00:27:22.704
MARISHA: I'll take it.

00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:26.413
TRAVIS: I feel like Beau should have it, for some
reason, some dreadful reason.

00:27:26.413 --> 00:27:27.984
MARISHA: I might get in a ruckus.

00:27:27.984 --> 00:27:29.126
LAURA: Don't get in a--!

00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:31.220
MARISHA: I'm going to try to avoid ruckuses.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.760
LAURA: Hey, Gluzzo. Can I take him aside?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.777
MATT: He's standing tall now, once again. Even
with a slight hunch, he's still close to seven

00:27:39.777 --> 00:27:45.642
feet. Him and Caduceus are in a similar range,
with a similar hunch, but his ears are a little

00:27:45.642 --> 00:27:51.497
wider out there. A lot heavier fur. He's
pleasantly dopey.

00:27:52.639 --> 00:27:53.568
LAURA: Gluzzo.

00:27:53.568 --> 00:27:54.625
MATT: "Yes?"

00:27:55.215 --> 00:28:00.402
LAURA: Can you tell me about the Light that you
pray to, please?

00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:04.573
MATT: "Oh, are you familiar with the Luxon?"

00:28:05.263 --> 00:28:13.513
LAURA: Yes, I have heard a little bit about it, but
I was wondering what you could tell me about it.

00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:28.140
MATT: "To be perfectly honest, I don't know all
that much. The darker elves tell us of great

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:37.489
"possible things if we work together as a
community. Since I've grown up, it was always

00:28:37.489 --> 00:28:42.040
"about the Luxon, as a place to come to, and--"

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.907
LAURA: Place to come to?

00:28:43.907 --> 00:28:47.678
MATT: "There is a place to worship in the city,
yes."

00:28:48.168 --> 00:28:49.219
LAURA: Really?

00:28:49.219 --> 00:28:49.924
MATT: "Yes."

00:28:50.414 --> 00:28:51.996
LAURA: What does it look like?

00:28:52.416 --> 00:28:58.105
MATT: "It looks sort of like--" He pulls out his
necklace. Those who are paying attention, you can

00:28:58.105 --> 00:29:08.108
see across the chain a small, wire-frame
dodecahedron made of rough metal. He goes,

00:29:09.308 --> 00:29:23.933
"The Luxon, they say, is the first and the original
god of Exandria. If we work hard together and we

00:29:23.933 --> 00:29:28.744
"stay pious towards the light, then maybe
one day we, too, will be reborn."

00:29:29.664 --> 00:29:33.004
LAURA: Right. Because that would be really cool,
to be reborn.

00:29:33.394 --> 00:29:42.157
MATT: "Yeah. Especially," he points back, "since
my line of work is not all that safe. Anyway."

00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:48.081
LAURA: To the light, and stuff! Also the
Traveler.

00:29:49.427 --> 00:29:53.639
MATT: "Okay!" He starts walking towards the city.

00:29:55.179 --> 00:29:57.140
LAURA: Oh god, their god is our thing!

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.232
SAM: Is the bugbear god the same as the Kryn?

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:01.790
LAURA: Yeah, yeah!

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.527
TRAVIS: Did you say, "to the light"?

00:30:04.527 --> 00:30:10.360
LAURA: Yeah, he was saying he prayed to the light.
He prays to a thing that looks like our thing.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.211
MARISHA: We have their god in our haversack?

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:16.516
LAURA: I know, I think we have a holy relic or
something!

00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:21.099
TALIESIN: It might be. That seems to make sense.
The Luxon, right? That's what I heard.

00:30:21.099 --> 00:30:22.123
LAURA: Luxon.

00:30:22.443 --> 00:30:23.920
LIAM: I've told you about this.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.066
SAM: You've told us about the Luxon?

00:30:26.066 --> 00:30:27.580
TALIESIN: That ring any bells?

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.963
MATT: Roll a religion check.

00:30:28.963 --> 00:30:30.807
TALIESIN: I was hoping you'd say that.

00:30:33.577 --> 00:30:35.722
MARISHA: We thought it was a different Luxor.

00:30:35.722 --> 00:30:36.493
TALIESIN: Seven.

00:30:36.493 --> 00:30:44.678
MATT: Total, seven? Nah. Nope. Never heard of it.
Other than-- at that roll, you barely remember

00:30:44.678 --> 00:30:48.812
that Caleb mentioned it a couple of times. You're
like, oh, oh yeah. That's as much as you know.

00:30:48.812 --> 00:30:50.526
TALIESIN: That's generous of you.

00:30:51.456 --> 00:30:57.288
SAM: We have their holy relic in addition to the
relic that can maybe--

00:30:58.088 --> 00:30:59.214
TRAVIS: Amplify it?

00:30:59.214 --> 00:31:02.015
SAM: Also give them children? I mean, this is--

00:31:02.015 --> 00:31:03.540
TRAVIS: I don't know about that.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:10.244
LAURA: I think it's all about their being reborn.
I think the children, what if-- (gasps) Oh my god!

00:31:10.244 --> 00:31:15.616
What if, when people die, their soul gets trapped
inside of this thing? Until it's returned, new

00:31:15.616 --> 00:31:21.307
souls can't go into new babies, and so no babies
can be born and stuff? What if we're keeping all

00:31:21.307 --> 00:31:22.973
of the souls with us?

00:31:23.633 --> 00:31:27.793
MARISHA: What if our souls get trapped in it, and
we're stuck in there for thousands of years? I

00:31:27.793 --> 00:31:30.177
don't want to be a baby again! Being a baby
sucked!

00:31:30.177 --> 00:31:32.818
SAM: Oh no, you're getting younger right now!

00:31:32.818 --> 00:31:33.608
MARISHA: Shit!

00:31:35.998 --> 00:31:40.667
LIAM: I think that we are still in a wait-and-see
moment here.

00:31:40.667 --> 00:31:46.429
TRAVIS: I think we've used it a fair number of
times and nobody's turned into a wee <i>enfant</i>.

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:50.045
LAURA: I'm not saying you turn into a baby.

00:31:50.935 --> 00:31:52.248
SAM: Beau is saying that.

00:31:52.428 --> 00:31:54.145
TRAVIS: That is what Beau is saying.

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:59.304
MARISHA: I don't want to be reincarnated as a
baby. Reincarnate me as a tiefling or a

00:31:59.304 --> 00:32:00.504
dwarf or something.

00:32:00.664 --> 00:32:04.765
SAM: Sorry, Beau, just going to say, too soon for
the whole Reincarnate business.

00:32:04.795 --> 00:32:09.015
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to-- I spit there.
I didn't mean to spit on you.

00:32:09.015 --> 00:32:12.017
LAURA: How does that work, though? Can I ask a
question, though?

00:32:12.017 --> 00:32:12.817
SAM: Sure.

00:32:12.817 --> 00:32:17.709
LAURA: How did it work? Did you come back as
already a functional person? Or did you come back

00:32:17.709 --> 00:32:19.437
as a baby goblin?

00:32:20.177 --> 00:32:30.211
SAM: No, I came back as what you see here, minus a
year or two. I was a full-grown goblin.

00:32:30.211 --> 00:32:37.218
LAURA: Where did this body come from, you know
what I mean? Was it somebody else's, or did it

00:32:37.218 --> 00:32:40.245
appear magically or something? I don't
understand.

00:32:40.245 --> 00:32:48.914
SAM: That hurts a little. I don't know. I don't
know if they put my spirit in someone else's body,

00:32:48.914 --> 00:33:00.937
or if the body was made, or what. I don't know.
This body bleeds, so it's not some sort of-- it

00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:02.787
wasn't built by a man.

00:33:02.787 --> 00:33:06.973
MARISHA: Maybe you were a baby and you don't
remember it. Most people don't remember when

00:33:06.973 --> 00:33:08.357
they're babies. I mean, I do.

00:33:08.357 --> 00:33:11.212
LAURA: Yeah, but then they remember when they're,
like, four.

00:33:11.212 --> 00:33:16.120
TALIESIN: I feel like we're getting to the root of
something with you that I really want to explore

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.789
later. I'm not sure what it is yet.

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:22.997
SAM: I don't think I was ever a baby because, if I
were a baby, and I grew up to be a goblin adult,

00:33:22.997 --> 00:33:27.313
my son would be ten, 12 years, right now?

00:33:27.313 --> 00:33:28.254
LAURA: That's true.

00:33:28.254 --> 00:33:30.061
TRAVIS: Yeah, Flight of the Navigator.

00:33:30.061 --> 00:33:34.637
MARISHA: I did just stare at this relic in front
of Gluzzo.

00:33:34.637 --> 00:33:35.942
LAURA: He didn't see it.

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:38.467
MARISHA: Is that super insensitive, though?

00:33:39.525 --> 00:33:44.315
LAURA: It looked like your head was in the bag. It
probably looked like you were eating some

00:33:44.315 --> 00:33:45.680
trail mix or something.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.051
LIAM: He doesn't strike me as a high, holy,
learnéd man of the cloth, if it is even a

00:33:50.051 --> 00:33:58.305
traditional religion. From what I have read,
people here, the Kryn, used to worship a different

00:33:58.305 --> 00:34:01.987
god, I don't know how long ago. Lolth.

00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:06.824
SAM: Lolth? I can tell why they stopped
worshipping that one.

00:34:07.784 --> 00:34:17.083
LIAM: This is some sort of a change for them.
Whether that is 20 years ago, a hundred years ago,

00:34:17.083 --> 00:34:27.396
300, I don't know. The writings I found on that
were somewhat vague. Whoever wrote this text

00:34:27.396 --> 00:34:35.661
believed that this Luxon, whatever it is, is
misleading the people here, and also that it is

00:34:35.661 --> 00:34:41.631
because of the Luxon that this darkness, I think,
that we are seeing, is connected to them.

00:34:42.701 --> 00:34:45.500
This light and darkness.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:53.633
LAURA: It's responsible for the dunamancy?
Dunamis?

00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:55.283
LIAM: Possibly connected.

00:34:55.913 --> 00:35:00.483
TRAVIS: Is there anyone heading out of the city in
our direction, now that we've spent some time?

00:35:00.483 --> 00:35:05.253
MATT: Make a perception check. First off, Gluzzo is
about 90 feet from you, walking towards the city.

00:35:05.253 --> 00:35:07.017
SAM: Oh! We should probably catch up.

00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:10.443
MATT: He started walking, and you guys kept
talking, and he kept walking.

00:35:10.883 --> 00:35:11.838
TRAVIS: 14.

00:35:13.178 --> 00:35:15.303
LAURA: Should we disguise ourselves?

00:35:15.303 --> 00:35:23.083
LIAM: I think, for maximum time, we should--
everyone pull up your hoods, and let's get closer

00:35:23.083 --> 00:35:26.398
to the city. Otherwise we are going to burn
through 20 or 30 minutes.

00:35:26.398 --> 00:35:29.271
TRAVIS: Yeah. Fair enough. Well, let's see who's
on the road.

00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:36.230
MATT: Looking ahead, best you can see, there's a
low fog that permeates a lot of the field in front

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:42.458
of you this early in the morning, based on the
recent rains that have happened. You don't see

00:35:42.458 --> 00:35:47.548
anyone. You're not close enough to draw attention,
but there's a lot of activity around the city,

00:35:47.548 --> 00:35:52.712
though it's too far to really make out the fine
details. You do see, now in the daylight, some

00:35:52.712 --> 00:35:59.874
sort of a perimeter wall. Looks to be a gray or
purple hue; it's hard to really tell from this

00:35:59.874 --> 00:36:06.201
distance. You can see watchtowers scattered along
the outskirts a little bit. You can vaguely see one

00:36:06.201 --> 00:36:17.846
one spire, loosely central to the entire shape of the
city's skyline. There's a bunch of things gathered

00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:22.138
around the outside of the wall. You'll probably
have to get closer to make out more detail.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:25.324
TRAVIS: Not a ton of traffic on the road coming in
and out just yet?

00:36:25.324 --> 00:36:29.903
MATT: Hard to tell from this distance. There are
no roads leading to you; you guys are out in the

00:36:29.903 --> 00:36:30.867
middle of the field.

00:36:32.577 --> 00:36:37.522
TRAVIS: Let's get a little closer, and I'll use
Disguise Self to make myself look fucking jacked.

00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:44.465
Huge-ass traps and delts, and my clothes
don’t quite fit right anymore. Rippling-ass

00:36:44.465 --> 00:36:46.141
muscles, and I'm--

00:36:46.391 --> 00:36:48.535
LIAM: I thought that you already were jacked?

00:36:48.535 --> 00:36:51.335
TRAVIS: No, I'm fucking jacked. Fjord--

00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:52.933
SAM: You're shredded.

00:36:53.623 --> 00:36:57.866
TRAVIS: Yeah. I have to turn like this.

00:37:00.866 --> 00:37:03.143
MARISHA: Never stretched a day in your life.

00:37:04.153 --> 00:37:07.190
LAURA: He's got skinny chicken legs, but super
big--

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.342
TRAVIS: If I've got to run I'm like (awkward
galloping).

00:37:10.342 --> 00:37:13.663
LIAM and LAURA: Always skip leg day.

00:37:13.663 --> 00:37:15.092
MATT: It only gets in the way.

00:37:15.092 --> 00:37:19.404
LAURA: I'm going to use Disguise Self to make
myself look like me, only super goth.

00:37:19.834 --> 00:37:21.530
MATT: Okay. Goth Jester.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:28.907
LAURA: Goth Jester. I'm going to do makeup like
Yasha's, so black stuff and eyeliner. Leathers,

00:37:28.907 --> 00:37:38.572
tattered black leathers, and dark lipstick.
Definitely black fingernails and tattoos and stuff.

00:37:38.572 --> 00:37:43.298
MATT: Okay. Yasha reaches down and gets some mud
and smears it down her face. You see these finger

00:37:43.298 --> 00:37:50.271
lines across the front. Musses up the outside so
she looks like she's been wandering and hunting

00:37:50.271 --> 00:37:52.223
alone in the wild for a while.

00:37:52.663 --> 00:37:57.419
TALIESIN: I'll play with that. I'm going to scar
myself up, and emaciate, and let everything get a

00:37:57.419 --> 00:38:01.935
little craggly. A little more Dark Crystal-y on
the wrong end.

00:38:01.935 --> 00:38:03.210
LAURA: Ooh, nice!

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.451
LIAM: How do you want to do this?

00:38:06.311 --> 00:38:19.654
MARISHA: Can you make me a dude tiefling? A red,
shifty-looking tiefling? Red skin, deep eyes.

00:38:19.772 --> 00:38:21.506
LAURA: Deep, what color eyes?

00:38:21.506 --> 00:38:24.368
LIAM: Crazy eyes, like you're demonstrating for me
right now?

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.557
MARISHA: Yeah, like that.

00:38:26.987 --> 00:38:28.950
SAM: You can't change your voice, now.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.573
MARISHA: What, you don't think I sound like a
dude?

00:38:31.573 --> 00:38:33.290
SAM: Kind of. Yeah, no. You're good.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.500
MARISHA: Give me a dude physique that would match
this.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:43.010
LIAM: Okay, so I pull out a small caterpillar's
cocoon, and I start muttering some arcane words

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:48.328
over it. I waft it in front of your face, and then
poof. She is a, poof.

00:38:48.328 --> 00:38:55.000
MATT: There you go. You are a red tiefling. It's
pretty accurate as you can envision, at least what

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.581
you can see of yourself. You don't really have any
reflective surface to check, but based on this,

00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:01.290
not bad.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.529
MARISHA: I check my pants.

00:39:04.089 --> 00:39:10.579
MATT: You're a dude tiefling. Since Caleb's really
only seen one dude's tiefling before--

00:39:10.579 --> 00:39:14.720
(laughter and applause)

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.511
MATT: Long may he reign indeed.

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:18.385
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:39:18.385 --> 00:39:20.381
LAURA: He's only seen one dude's tiefling.

00:39:21.312 --> 00:39:29.826
MARISHA: Why is just my dick purple? I don't
understand. There's a gradient.

00:39:30.298 --> 00:39:32.014
LIAM: It's just a sunny-side up egg.

00:39:33.763 --> 00:39:38.312
MARISHA: My happy trail has an ombre. This is
incredible!

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.778
MATT: The benefits of the tiefling.

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:44.682
SAM: Long and wide may he reign!

00:39:47.877 --> 00:39:48.794
MATT: Anyway.

00:39:49.436 --> 00:39:57.891
LIAM: Hold on, we are not finished yet. I begin to
cast Disguise Self on myself. I make myself look

00:39:57.891 --> 00:40:08.993
like a male version of Jester, blue, like a twin,
but not quite as goth. Just dialed way back-- A

00:40:08.993 --> 00:40:15.315
little bit, but not quite as goth, but identical.
I can't do anything about the voice, I'm sorry.

00:40:15.609 --> 00:40:16.400
Let's go.

00:40:17.745 --> 00:40:23.079
MATT: All right. Given that there's a time limit
on the duration of these spells, a little hustle

00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:24.510
probably wouldn't hurt.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.246
SAM: Let's do it.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:29.645
MATT: You guys pick up the pace a bit, jogging
through the muddy fields. (squelching) Your boots

00:40:29.645 --> 00:40:34.606
are occasionally getting caught for a moment, but
you manage to maintain a decent pace heading

00:40:34.606 --> 00:40:40.706
towards Asarius. You catch up to Gluzzo who goes,
"All right, we're running! Okay!" And he keeps up

00:40:40.706 --> 00:40:43.599
with you bounding alongside.

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:50.971
LIAM: It's still us. We just went through the
Saint's Row character creation.

00:40:50.971 --> 00:40:51.976
MATT: Yep. Basically.

00:40:51.976 --> 00:40:56.587
TALIESIN: I like that we now have MC Christ and
Gerard Way at the table. It's all I really needed.

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:59.960
MATT: This is our version of Monster Factory. Much
love to the brothers.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.501
SAM: By the way, Matt, side note: this music is
fucking awesome! Whatever you're doing? Amazing.

00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:09.765
MATT: Thank you, Blizzard, for giving us approval
to use Diablo music.

00:41:09.765 --> 00:41:10.802
LAURA: Oh, tight!

00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:11.895
LIAM: Thanks, Blizzard.

00:41:11.895 --> 00:41:12.994
MARISHA: Thanks, Blizz.

00:41:14.014 --> 00:41:15.244
TRAVIS: For the light.

00:41:15.704 --> 00:41:17.349
LAURA: (laughing) For the light.

00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:23.806
MATT: As you approach the City of Beasts, you can
see now the tall fort-like wooden walls. Planks of

00:41:23.806 --> 00:41:29.473
purple-colored wood sharpened into a point ten
feet from the ground around the perimeter.

00:41:29.473 --> 00:41:36.043
Watchtowers peaking over at a number of points
along. Knowing Caleb's direction sense thanks to

00:41:36.043 --> 00:41:43.039
his feat, you're approaching from a
southern-southwestern direction. Batches of mud

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:49.107
fields surrounding the eastern end of the city are
visible where crews of hobgoblins and bugbears

00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:55.296
harvest roots and tubers and other strange and
hardy produce from the unexpectedly cultivable

00:41:55.296 --> 00:42:02.102
land around this city. The western side, which
would be to your left, outside the walls is dense

00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:07.941
with wheeled carts, armored orcs, gnolls, and
other goblinoid soldiers checking and cleaning

00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:16.625
equipment and occasionally bickering. You can see,
though the war is on that side of Xhorhas, there

00:42:16.625 --> 00:42:24.201
is still a military presence here. Your eyes catch
the rare Kryn soldier who's wandering through the

00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:32.035
ranks keeping the peace and checking in with
members of this regiment. A handful of large hills

00:42:32.035 --> 00:42:38.465
sit among the crews, resting places for ballista
and supplies as goblins lift and unload boxes and

00:42:38.465 --> 00:42:43.760
affix heavy artillery to the top of these mounds.
As you're continuing to move towards the city

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:49.673
looking at this display, you see a group of gnolls
together tugging on these heavy leather straps at

00:42:49.673 --> 00:42:56.502
the base of one of these mounds and you watch as
it shifts, mud and dirt tumbling from the sides

00:42:56.502 --> 00:43:03.503
revealing four hut-sized, thick trunks of legs
from underneath. A colossal war tortoise.

00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.253
LAURA: What?!

00:43:06.321 --> 00:43:14.069
MATT: From this distance, you can only guess 60 to
80 feet from end to end on this shell. (heavy footsteps)

00:43:14.545 --> 00:43:16.366
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.303
LIAM: It's a war tortoise, man. It's a war
tortoise. War tortoise.

00:43:19.562 --> 00:43:21.606
MARISHA: Can we trade The Mistake for that?

00:43:21.609 --> 00:43:26.227
MATT: A pair of goblins rush up immediately to the
front to shovel baskets of moss and other roots

00:43:26.227 --> 00:43:35.552
into the mouth of the large behemoth. You're in
awe of this and noticing the numerous mounds now:

00:43:35.552 --> 00:43:43.581
four, five visibly scattered amongst this war
band. A series of growls and muffled barks catch

00:43:43.581 --> 00:43:49.801
your attention towards the front ranks where you
can see numerous large, tailless, panther-like

00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:57.193
beasts tethered to heavy posts, saddled and
lightly armored for future combat. You glance past

00:43:57.193 --> 00:44:04.658
the small army beyond that, beyond the mounds to
see two gargantuan shapes making a wide perimeter

00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:12.747
around the city loosely in your direction. A pair
of the massive furred hulks that you first saw

00:44:12.747 --> 00:44:18.381
when you first entered Xhorhas in the distance.
They're stalking around the wastes and the

00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:23.414
surrounding grounds. Heavy iron chains wrapped
like a harness across their 20-foot wide torso

00:44:23.414 --> 00:44:30.242
each mounted by an armored Kryn who's rocking back
and forth with each impact of its huge tree

00:44:30.242 --> 00:44:38.144
trunk-like limbs dragging itself through the muck
and mud. You can see squat legs dragging it

00:44:38.144 --> 00:44:43.829
forward as its limbs pull it forward like a heavy
gorilla. All covered in a dark gray-brown fur

00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:50.397
that's matted with mud and grime. The face of the
creature, which you see for the first time now

00:44:50.397 --> 00:44:56.715
that it's getting close enough, rests between the
shoulders without neck or really a head. Just

00:44:56.715 --> 00:45:02.484
embedded between where the shoulders are as part
of the torso. A gray, scaled, leathery brow that

00:45:02.484 --> 00:45:10.410
folds around four red eyes the size of cannonballs
arranged much like a spider's face and a tangle of

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:15.235
teeth and tusks that protrude from a frighteningly
wide mouth that almost leads from shoulder to

00:45:15.235 --> 00:45:21.353
shoulder at the very front. (stomping) As it
shifts forward, one of the mouths opens and you

00:45:21.353 --> 00:45:27.481
see this large, heavy, thick tongue pull off and
scrape against the tusks and then withdraw into

00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:36.788
the mouth and the jaw closes shut. You can feel on
the ground with each heavy limb fall (stomping).

00:45:36.788 --> 00:45:38.603
SAM: Those are in the city or outside?

00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:40.121
MATT: This is outside the city.

00:45:40.121 --> 00:45:41.544
LIAM: Roughly how tall?

00:45:41.564 --> 00:45:46.020
MATT: That creature is probably about 30 feet at
the top of its height. Shoulder height.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.501
TRAVIS: But 20 feet wide.

00:45:47.501 --> 00:45:53.281
MATT: The shoulders are about 20 feet wide side to
side. If you're to look at it head on like 20, 25

00:45:53.281 --> 00:45:57.662
feet right there. The shoulders themselves are
about 20 feet apart and from the top when it's

00:45:57.662 --> 00:46:02.040
fully stood up, you imagine it'd probably get up
to about 25 or 30 feet, but it tends to be a

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.706
little hunched as it pulls forward.

00:46:03.706 --> 00:46:08.267
TRAVIS: You know when you go to that area in the
game and you're not quite leveled up for it yet?

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:10.314
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, and you run the other way.

00:46:10.314 --> 00:46:17.214
LAURA: Yes. You guys, not to be pessimistic or
anything, but I think their army is way cooler

00:46:17.214 --> 00:46:20.596
than the army that we've seen.

00:46:21.006 --> 00:46:22.481
SAM: Mm-hmm. For sure.

00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:27.570
LAURA: Maybe we should all just hang out and be
part of Xhorhas from now on. I mean, they're

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.462
pretty cool.

00:46:28.462 --> 00:46:29.929
MARISHA: They are pretty cool.

00:46:29.929 --> 00:46:33.924
LAURA: They've got moving hills. They've got these
giant spider weird guys.

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:35.505
MARISHA: I want a war turtle.

00:46:35.505 --> 00:46:37.443
TRAVIS: The tortoises are crazy.

00:46:37.443 --> 00:46:41.870
SAM: We have not tasted the food here yet. Maybe
let's just reserve judgment for--

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:43.209
LAURA: But we have Caduceus.

00:46:43.209 --> 00:46:47.821
TALIESIN: I feel like we're gilding an awful lot
of expectations at the moment. I'd really like to

00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:50.010
get a better sense of these people before we--

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:52.330
LAURA: Decide to live here?

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.399
TALIESIN: Even decide how we feel about it.

00:46:54.399 --> 00:46:55.823
LIAM: Roughly 51 more minutes.

00:46:55.933 --> 00:46:57.210
LAURA: Okay, let's go.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:02.062
SAM: Yes, this might be like... You know when you
go to Hawaii and you're like: why don't we live here?

00:47:02.062 --> 00:47:02.852
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:02.852 --> 00:47:03.912
LIAM: 50 minutes.

00:47:04.522 --> 00:47:12.571
MATT: You push on and Gluzzo is jogging alongside
you and keeping his head down. You guys approach

00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:20.551
the southeast gates. Each side is about ten feet
wide, maybe 15 feet tall. It actually crawls up

00:47:20.551 --> 00:47:25.437
higher than the rest of the surrounding wall and
has a slight arch to it. One of them is closed the

00:47:25.437 --> 00:47:29.912
other is partially open. You can see some soldiers
are coming in and out. Other people that are

00:47:29.912 --> 00:47:35.413
working the field start exchanging directions and
that would be the nearest entrance-- pardon--

00:47:35.413 --> 00:47:36.838
to the city.

00:47:37.456 --> 00:47:41.977
MARISHA: Does it look like there are people blocking
the entrance? Like they're heavily guarded?

00:47:41.977 --> 00:47:48.049
MATT: No one blocking the entrance, but you do see
on each side of it two very large and armored

00:47:48.049 --> 00:47:56.867
ogres. Both holding heavy clubs with an axe blade
on each side. They're just there looking out.

00:47:58.753 --> 00:48:03.224
TRAVIS: Are people that are coming and going are
they wearing anything identifying? Any kind of

00:48:03.224 --> 00:48:05.420
medals, badges, pins, ribbons?

00:48:05.498 --> 00:48:07.020
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:48:08.353 --> 00:48:11.383
MARISHA: The people who are coming and going, are
the ogres stopping them?

00:48:11.503 --> 00:48:12.196
MATT: No.

00:48:13.616 --> 00:48:14.635
TRAVIS: 19.

00:48:14.885 --> 00:48:21.923
MATT: 19? Nothing that you can really make out,
unfortunately. I mean, their outfits aren't

00:48:21.923 --> 00:48:26.838
uniform. Everything is very patchwork and
scavenged or put together to, at least from

00:48:26.838 --> 00:48:33.092
what you've seen, to be utilitarian. There's no
decor. As you approach this heavy gate, you can

00:48:33.092 --> 00:48:38.005
see one of the ogres looks to you all and
(growling breaths).

00:48:38.889 --> 00:48:40.541
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (grunt)

00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:42.354
SAM: Can we just walk with confidence?

00:48:42.354 --> 00:48:43.067
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:48:43.067 --> 00:48:43.788
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:43.788 --> 00:48:45.977
MATT: Who's leading the charge in to the city?

00:48:45.977 --> 00:48:47.027
TRAVIS: I am.

00:48:48.317 --> 00:48:49.866
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.

00:48:49.866 --> 00:48:52.917
LIAM: It's just like we're sneaking into an E3
party. Here we go.

00:48:52.927 --> 00:48:54.497
MATT: Done that a thousand times.

00:48:54.497 --> 00:48:58.167
LAURA: Yeah, look like you belong. Look like you
belong, no one will stop you.

00:48:58.167 --> 00:48:58.876
TRAVIS: 16.

00:48:58.876 --> 00:49:02.064
MATT: Yeah, we've all had to sneak into our own
game parties before.

00:49:02.064 --> 00:49:03.071
MARISHA: That's true.

00:49:03.981 --> 00:49:14.616
MATT: Low on the totem pole, us actors. As you
grunt and the ogre grunts back, you keep walking.

00:49:14.616 --> 00:49:23.077
He doesn't pay attention. He doesn't notice. You
all weasel past through the six-foot space of the

00:49:23.077 --> 00:49:28.708
right hand door that's open, and enter Asarius.

00:49:28.708 --> 00:49:29.765
TRAVIS: We're in.

00:49:29.765 --> 00:49:30.996
TALIESIN: City of Beasts.

00:49:30.996 --> 00:49:36.856
MATT: Within the city, the winding dirt roads you
already see before you are rough and slick with

00:49:36.856 --> 00:49:41.518
the recent rainfall as the air itself is pungent
with the smells of animal hair, wet earth, and

00:49:41.518 --> 00:49:47.356
dung. It immediately hits you like a wall. This is
the largest petting zoo you could ever consider

00:49:47.356 --> 00:49:55.299
visiting. Droves of waste folk wander the streets.
Burly ogres clutching barrels and beams. You can

00:49:55.299 --> 00:50:00.146
see orcs that are dragging hunted quarry behind
them through the mud or over their shoulders some

00:50:00.146 --> 00:50:04.819
of them still struggling, not quite dead from the
wounds they sustained before an orc just takes it

00:50:04.819 --> 00:50:09.967
and slams it across its back so it goes to
stillness and stops moving. Not a lot of

00:50:09.967 --> 00:50:16.769
conversation, but occasional bickering and
growling at each other. There is still a civilized

00:50:16.769 --> 00:50:21.687
sense of order to this. More than you would have
assumed based on the interactions you've had with

00:50:21.687 --> 00:50:29.259
gnolls and other such creatures who seem to live
in these spaces. Goblins especially. And you do

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:34.794
see goblins. You do see goblins and goblin-kin
children rushing through the alleys and scurrying

00:50:34.794 --> 00:50:40.862
off into the roads. Clusters of them carrying
something together. Some of them just trying to

00:50:40.862 --> 00:50:46.152
wait for something to drop or be left or forgotten
from one of the larger folk and then just

00:50:46.152 --> 00:50:47.919
scavenged and taken away.

00:50:47.919 --> 00:50:50.489
LAURA: Definitely keeping hands on pockets and
pouches.

00:50:50.489 --> 00:50:51.238
MATT: Okay.

00:50:51.238 --> 00:50:52.019
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:50:52.019 --> 00:50:53.592
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out.

00:50:53.592 --> 00:50:56.302
LIAM: Did you give Jester back the haversack or
are you--?

00:50:56.302 --> 00:50:57.303
MARISHA: Yeah, I did.

00:50:57.313 --> 00:50:58.022
LIAM: Okay.

00:50:58.022 --> 00:51:00.782
LAURA: Part of my disguise it looks black with my
disguise.

00:51:02.012 --> 00:51:07.514
MATT: But the majority of the people you see that
are spread throughout the city are furred

00:51:07.514 --> 00:51:15.979
bugbears, scruffy gnolls, anxious kobolds,
actually, and the occasional minotaur.

00:51:16.299 --> 00:51:18.642
SAM: (gasp)

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:25.227
MATT: One in particular catches your eye who's
walking with two sets of five soldiers on each

00:51:25.227 --> 00:51:35.054
side, Kryn soldiers. You see one massive minotaur,
jet black onyx fur, giant grown horns that curve

00:51:35.054 --> 00:51:42.533
to the front. Pristine-- uncharacteristically for
this space-- pristine silvered armor that is

00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:49.218
intricately carved and detailed. You can see this
dull gray cloak that falls past the shoulder

00:51:49.218 --> 00:51:57.546
mantle and drifts to the back of the knees. Its
hooves are adorned with a type of plate armor

00:51:57.546 --> 00:52:02.854
right to the front. As it looms by, you can see
this heavy greatsword that's thrown over its back.

00:52:02.854 --> 00:52:09.103
Everyone stops and gives wide berth as it walks
through across the street.

00:52:09.103 --> 00:52:12.205
LIAM: The whole table just turned into the horny
and aroused meme.

00:52:12.205 --> 00:52:13.164
LAURA: Yeah.

00:52:14.044 --> 00:52:15.294
SAM: I'm into this.

00:52:15.294 --> 00:52:17.134
LAURA: He was beautiful.

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:22.554
MATT: Continues down the street in loosely the
direction that you're traveling, but a good 20, 30

00:52:22.554 --> 00:52:26.165
feet ahead of you and then continues if you wanted
to keep pace or just wait.

00:52:26.165 --> 00:52:27.760
MARISHA: He had a posse?

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.572
MATT: A posse of roughly 11 or 12 Kryn.

00:52:32.572 --> 00:52:33.904
TRAVIS: Are just around him?

00:52:33.904 --> 00:52:38.911
MATT: Around him, yeah. You get the sense that he
has some sort of importance or station in this location.

00:52:38.911 --> 00:52:41.197
TRAVIS: Yeah. I was going to say that's a guard.

00:52:41.197 --> 00:52:44.099
TALIESIN: You've probably got to work hard to keep
that clean.

00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:44.812
LAURA: Wow.

00:52:44.812 --> 00:52:50.094
TRAVIS: Do we want to follow? Now that we're in,
is there anything that is discernible to the eye?

00:52:50.094 --> 00:52:51.223
Like a weapons store--

00:52:51.223 --> 00:52:52.878
MATT: Gluzzo's just walking away.

00:52:52.878 --> 00:52:54.454
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. He can just--

00:52:54.454 --> 00:52:57.830
MATT: He doesn't acknowledge. You're in the city
and he just walks away.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:06.473
TRAVIS: You forgot your... ten... gold. Okay.
Do we see anything like a blacksmithy or a

00:53:06.473 --> 00:53:07.723
weapons store or--

00:53:07.883 --> 00:53:08.904
SAM: Livestock?

00:53:08.904 --> 00:53:12.434
LIAM: Well, that's everywhere. That's going to be
hard to pinpoint a place.

00:53:12.434 --> 00:53:14.098
MATT: You can start to look around.

00:53:14.098 --> 00:53:15.675
LAURA: There's probably animals.

00:53:15.675 --> 00:53:17.154
SAM: We can ask around.

00:53:17.154 --> 00:53:21.671
TRAVIS: I don't want to make a lot of-- I don't
want to hit up a lot of contact just yet and see

00:53:21.671 --> 00:53:22.597
what we can see.

00:53:22.597 --> 00:53:27.075
MATT: Go ahead and make a general investigation
check. Oh, if you're not asking around, then it

00:53:27.075 --> 00:53:28.284
would just be perception.

00:53:28.395 --> 00:53:31.948
TRAVIS: Damn. Investigation would've been better.
Not bad, though; it's 19.

00:53:32.758 --> 00:53:37.574
MATT: As you guys begin to walk and enter the
city, you start taking in some of the sights

00:53:37.574 --> 00:53:44.477
around you. One thing you notice is there are
occasionally humans here. They're not all of the

00:53:44.477 --> 00:53:49.225
various monstrous races that you would've
expected. The humans that you do see here are

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:58.254
usually solitary and they are scarred and rough.
Possibly feral, it's hard to tell, but they have

00:53:58.254 --> 00:54:03.284
an eye about them like they've been through enough
to survive amongst these people in the wastes and

00:54:03.284 --> 00:54:10.895
this city. You get a sense of why Yasha put
herself into a little bit of that rough and tumble

00:54:10.895 --> 00:54:13.647
presentation before you entered.

00:54:14.228 --> 00:54:20.924
LIAM: Do they have the look of, say, beaten,
fearful slaves or rough--?

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.353
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:54:22.353 --> 00:54:23.063
LIAM: Yeah.

00:54:23.063 --> 00:54:24.200
TRAVIS: Good call.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.675
LIAM: (growling) Balls.

00:54:25.675 --> 00:54:28.723
TRAVIS: Maybe if you had more, you know, space in
that dice tray.

00:54:28.723 --> 00:54:29.596
LIAM: 12.

00:54:31.536 --> 00:54:40.438
MATT: You don't get a sense of any sort of
enslaved or subjugated aspect. They just seem to

00:54:40.438 --> 00:54:47.498
be another surviving member of the community who,
because they are human and the nature of the war

00:54:47.498 --> 00:54:53.115
and the kind of people that exist in this space,
has had to undergo some rough hazing.

00:54:53.115 --> 00:54:54.285
LIAM: Prison rules.

00:54:54.285 --> 00:54:55.386
MATT: Yeah, kind of.

00:54:55.386 --> 00:54:59.807
SAM: Is anyone wearing the symbol? The Lux? The
Luxor?

00:54:59.807 --> 00:55:01.327
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:55:01.327 --> 00:55:02.486
TRAVIS: Ooh, good call.

00:55:02.486 --> 00:55:04.295
SAM: Not great. Ten.

00:55:05.155 --> 00:55:08.025
MATT: It's hard to tell. There's a lot of
movement, and a lot of armor, and a lot of fur,

00:55:08.025 --> 00:55:13.356
and a lot of other types. You don't see anyone who
very overtly is showing off any sort of

00:55:13.356 --> 00:55:17.546
iconography or jewelry that would be similar to
what you saw on Gluzzo.

00:55:17.926 --> 00:55:24.355
MARISHA: Aside from the minotaur and the army, is
there any type of guards? Any type of--

00:55:24.355 --> 00:55:25.885
TRAVIS: The watchtowers.

00:55:27.435 --> 00:55:37.107
MATT: You don't see any noted guard. You don't see
anybody who seems to be uniformed or have any sort

00:55:37.107 --> 00:55:44.725
of an identifiable attire or imagery that would
give you the idea that there was a wandering

00:55:44.725 --> 00:55:45.874
guard, yet.

00:55:45.874 --> 00:55:51.017
MARISHA: The watchtowers seem like they're
probably for siege attacks, for army? They don't

00:55:51.017 --> 00:55:53.267
seem to have anybody posted in them?

00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:57.597
MATT: They do have people posted in them. You
don't know if that's because it is wartime, or

00:55:57.597 --> 00:56:00.847
that it's part of the watch over the city, or
both. You're uncertain.

00:56:00.847 --> 00:56:11.915
LIAM: Maybe you covered this and my player missed
it, but do the Kryns seem to be an occupying force

00:56:11.915 --> 00:56:13.245
or part of--

00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:15.435
LAURA: Why does it sound like you say Koreans?

00:56:15.435 --> 00:56:17.764
LIAM: Because it sounds like he's saying Koreans.

00:56:17.764 --> 00:56:19.006
LAURA: No, he says "Krin."

00:56:19.006 --> 00:56:19.957
MATT: I say "Kreen."

00:56:19.957 --> 00:56:23.311
LAURA: But you say "Kor-een," so it sounds like
you're saying--

00:56:23.311 --> 00:56:27.682
LIAM: I believe I said "Krin" last game, Laura
Bailey. This time I tried to match the dungeon

00:56:27.682 --> 00:56:32.305
master, but I am playing with a German accent and
sometimes strange things happen. You should have

00:56:32.305 --> 00:56:36.676
heard the things I had to say in a German accent
earlier today. It was this whole scene, man.

00:56:36.676 --> 00:56:38.526
TRAVIS: Twins, twins, please. Please.

00:56:38.526 --> 00:56:39.528
LAURA: Aww.

00:56:39.528 --> 00:56:42.348
LIAM: Occupying force or integrated with society?

00:56:44.378 --> 00:56:47.645
MATT: Make an insight check for me.

00:56:48.507 --> 00:56:52.862
LIAM: Give me a good roll. It's cocked, right?

00:56:52.862 --> 00:56:56.887
SAM: Because you have a thousand dice around it.

00:56:56.887 --> 00:57:00.557
LIAM: It was the same roll. 19.

00:57:00.557 --> 00:57:13.647
MATT: It's hard to tell. There doesn't seem to be
any fear of the Kryn as they walk around, but they

00:57:13.647 --> 00:57:24.210
don't seem to be fully integrated and rubbing
shoulders with the roughnecks of the city. You

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:31.649
don't sense any sort of tension that would
normally be part of an occupying force.

00:57:31.649 --> 00:57:32.859
LIAM: Yeah. Okay.

00:57:32.859 --> 00:57:38.875
TRAVIS: I'm of the mind that we should follow the
big minotaur. I mean, he could only be going to

00:57:38.875 --> 00:57:40.909
and from places of importance.

00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:42.006
SAM: Did we see where he went?

00:57:42.006 --> 00:57:45.448
MATT: Yeah, he's still walking ahead of you guys
with a brisk pace. There's some distance growing

00:57:45.448 --> 00:57:46.391
between the two of you.

00:57:46.391 --> 00:57:48.126
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll keep 20 to 30 feet behind.

00:57:48.126 --> 00:57:50.133
LIAM: I thought we were trying to get beasts to
ride.

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:55.187
MATT: As part of this, as you're walking, and
based on the perception roll that you made--

00:57:55.187 --> 00:58:01.757
because I'm going to fill you in on more of that.
Looking around, the structures of this building

00:58:01.757 --> 00:58:08.457
are varied and patchwork, with huts and hovels
mingling with mud-brick buildings and domes, and

00:58:08.457 --> 00:58:15.974
small, roughly-hewn and sculpted domiciles. You
pass one of the dormant tortoises that you saw

00:58:15.974 --> 00:58:22.158
that's actually in the city. It's sitting there
occupying a lot in this city. Atop its back, you

00:58:22.158 --> 00:58:28.240
see a goblin neighborhood of dense shacks and
dwellings, clustered, built, and strapped onto its

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.842
back. You can see--

00:58:29.842 --> 00:58:31.090
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here.

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:33.132
MARISHA: That's so fucking cool!

00:58:33.132 --> 00:58:37.929
LAURA: Did it crawl into the city because it could
move?! The whole city can move?!

00:58:37.929 --> 00:58:39.899
MARISHA: Yes, it the turtle still alive?

00:58:39.899 --> 00:58:47.079
MATT: You can't tell. All you see is the shell
there and this goblin neighborhood built atop its

00:58:47.079 --> 00:58:55.368
shell that's strapped and pressed onto it. You can
see all these clustered tents and huts and pieces

00:58:55.368 --> 00:59:00.613
of gathered and scavenged woods that have been
pressed together to create this small shantytown

00:59:00.613 --> 00:59:05.107
atop this tortoise shell. There you can see a few
goblins out there that are doing repairs,

00:59:05.107 --> 00:59:05.989
a few that are--

00:59:05.989 --> 00:59:08.114
TALIESIN: I was going to say, cruise ships are the
worst.

00:59:08.739 --> 00:59:12.090
MATT: Some that are stretching out leather to tan,
but the weather isn't good for tanning. They're

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:16.491
getting frustrated because it's getting mildewy.
This goblin's like (angry muttering) and trying to

00:59:16.491 --> 00:59:19.951
stretch it out more and breathe hot on it. It's
not really doing anything.

00:59:19.951 --> 00:59:23.976
LAURA: Nott! Did you live on a turtle?

00:59:23.976 --> 00:59:27.002
SAM: No, I did not live on a turtle. I've never
seen anything like that. That's <i>amazing</i>.

00:59:27.002 --> 00:59:29.140
LAURA: This is way cooler than what you had.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.471
SAM: Yes. Yes.

00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:35.821
MARISHA: I really feel like we should invest in a
turtle. It seems so useful.

00:59:35.821 --> 00:59:42.249
SAM: The maintenance, though. If you own a turtle,
you have to fix everything on it.

00:59:42.249 --> 00:59:44.665
MARISHA: That's true. What if you rent the turtle,
is that--

00:59:44.665 --> 00:59:46.911
MATT: Leasing is really the way to go.

00:59:46.911 --> 00:59:48.917
MARISHA: Yeah, lease it. Get the newest turtle.

00:59:48.917 --> 00:59:50.290
LIAM: It's a business expense.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:53.575
MATT: As you guys pass the small goblin
neighborhood to your right, you hear the familiar

00:59:53.575 --> 01:00:02.766
barks that had echoed from the army earlier. You
pass a preserve/livery for those panther-like

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:10.241
beasts. You can see a numerous number of these
kept in this large pen. They have these chain

01:00:10.241 --> 01:00:15.349
collars around their neck, and they're all
tethered to a central, heavy pole that's currently

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:19.188
pressed deep into the mud. There are some of them
that are lying and sleeping; some of them are

01:00:19.188 --> 01:00:25.739
hungrily pacing on the outside of the pen, looking
at the passersby and growling. Getting a better

01:00:25.739 --> 01:00:33.773
look at it, you can see they have this wonderfully
aerodynamic profile to them. Their head and neck

01:00:33.773 --> 01:00:38.384
are sloped all the way past their shoulders to the
back. Basically, it isn't until the hind haunches

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:45.282
that the curvature ends. What it is is this super
slick, matted, thick, heavy, wiry fur that itself

01:00:45.282 --> 01:00:52.633
is a dull gray-purple color. It seems matted at
the top, and then it tends to fluff out a bit once

01:00:52.633 --> 01:01:00.294
you get past where the shoulders and the pits are
of its appendages. It's very panther-like in its

01:01:00.294 --> 01:01:05.614
physicality, just more muscular and lean and
stretched. A little more exaggerated in its feline

01:01:05.614 --> 01:01:11.540
figure, aside from the fact that its head is this
continuous, muscled neck into a sloped, toothy

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:18.923
mouth at the front. You can see on the sides these
two large, bulging, almost creepily fish-like eyes

01:01:18.923 --> 01:01:23.880
that are lidless and poke out the sides of the
head, looking out in both directions. In the

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.138
front, there is not a classic cat nose, but it
looks almost like a cat skull, but flesh pulled

01:01:30.138 --> 01:01:34.923
over it. It has these two open slits that are long
in the front. Its jaw hangs open with these two

01:01:34.923 --> 01:01:40.478
large tusks that curl up in the front, and its
tongue dangles out the front. (panting)

01:01:40.478 --> 01:01:43.042
LAURA: Can they blep? That's the important thing.

01:01:43.042 --> 01:01:44.341
MATT: We'll have to find out.

01:01:44.341 --> 01:01:46.615
LAURA: With the fish-eye blep. That would be so
cute.

01:01:46.615 --> 01:01:52.051
SAM: We've only seen these creatures on their own?
They're not carrying anything, and they don't have

01:01:52.051 --> 01:01:53.613
saddles of any sort?

01:01:53.613 --> 01:01:54.874
LIAM: I thought they were armored up.

01:01:54.874 --> 01:01:57.519
MATT: These ones do not. The ones that you saw
outside in the army were.

01:01:57.519 --> 01:02:01.023
SAM: Were armored, but didn't have people riding
on them?

01:02:01.023 --> 01:02:03.392
MATT: They were saddled up. They didn't have
people on them at the time.

01:02:03.392 --> 01:02:04.885
SAM: Oh, they were saddled up?

01:02:04.885 --> 01:02:06.262
LAURA: We could ride them.

01:02:06.262 --> 01:02:07.945
LIAM: We are going to Skeletor this shit.

01:02:07.945 --> 01:02:15.001
MATT: You also can see the single, three-story
spire of gray stone that Gluzzo had mentioned

01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:24.412
before that he said was called the Aurora Hold.
You can see portions of it are the stone

01:02:24.412 --> 01:02:28.724
structure, and then elements of dark, almost
tinted glass seem to make it up like a cathedral

01:02:28.724 --> 01:02:35.973
spire. It looms over the rest of the city, which
doesn't have a lot of variation in its height.

01:02:35.973 --> 01:02:40.625
Most of the buildings are built close to the
ground, whether it be from limitations on the

01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:45.547
people who constructed it or a cultural
indifference to trying to make things with

01:02:45.547 --> 01:02:55.333
multiple layers. You can see the distinctly elven
elements to its design and structure, which makes

01:02:55.333 --> 01:03:01.475
it stand out even more against the rest of the
city. You also pass inner-city livestock pens,

01:03:01.475 --> 01:03:08.291
with pigs that are kept in general pig conditions.
Not terrible, but they love their mud, and this is

01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:16.478
a good space for them. You can see one pen that
has these giant aurochs that are being kept as

01:03:16.478 --> 01:03:21.293
beasts of burden that are penned into each other
into a small space. There's a portion of the

01:03:21.293 --> 01:03:26.739
ground where more of those roots-- similar to
those large fields you saw being cultivated on the

01:03:26.739 --> 01:03:29.242
outside of the city-- there's a smaller version of
it being placed here.

01:03:29.242 --> 01:03:30.985
LAURA: (whispering) What's an auroch?

01:03:30.985 --> 01:03:32.151
LIAM: It's an ox.

01:03:32.151 --> 01:03:43.074
MATT: Yeah, a massive ox. Big, heavy, bison-type
fur wreath around its head, huge horns. These in

01:03:43.074 --> 01:03:51.207
particular, you would gather, probably pull a lot
of the heavy equipment and, from base to shoulder,

01:03:51.207 --> 01:03:52.775
probably stand about eight feet tall.

01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:54.357
LIAM: Big yak.

01:03:54.357 --> 01:03:56.924
SAM: Do we go talk to the livery folk?

01:03:56.924 --> 01:04:00.512
LAURA: Oh my gosh, can we ride these thingies with
the fish eyes?

01:04:00.512 --> 01:04:01.854
SAM: Yeah.

01:04:01.854 --> 01:04:04.952
MARISHA: Can I go knock on the turtle shell and
see if the turtle's still alive?

01:04:04.952 --> 01:04:07.557
TRAVIS: Let the tortoise thing go for a little
bit.

01:04:07.557 --> 01:04:10.825
SAM: The turtle shell's not connected to the
livery, right?

01:04:10.825 --> 01:04:18.051
MATT: No, it's a distance behind it. As a note, as
you walk through the city, denizens push past you.

01:04:18.051 --> 01:04:25.124
Some pay no mind; some do give a curious look
because you're certainly not a troop of mostly

01:04:25.124 --> 01:04:29.856
beast-looking folk. They don't seem to stop you.

01:04:29.856 --> 01:04:34.245
LIAM: Caleb noted the time when they cast their
spells. Would his keen mind tell them how

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:35.540
much is left?

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:45.634
MATT: At this time, I'd say you have between 25
and 20 minutes left of those spells, in the time

01:04:45.634 --> 01:04:47.384
that it's taken you to walk to the city and then
make your way this far inside, keeping an eye for

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.524
various details around you.

01:04:49.524 --> 01:04:54.057
TRAVIS: What if we split? What if we acquire some
transport from the people that don't have the fear

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.448
of changing back? The others can make their way
out of the city, and we'll meet you there.

01:04:57.448 --> 01:05:07.455
SAM: Or! We've seen some humans around here,
they're just scummy. You could just muck up your

01:05:07.455 --> 01:05:08.955
face and fit in.

01:05:08.955 --> 01:05:10.788
LAURA: Or we just fucking recast the spell.

01:05:10.788 --> 01:05:11.555
LIAM: Yeah.

01:05:11.555 --> 01:05:15.149
LAURA: Yeah. Just let us know when we're running
out of time.

01:05:15.149 --> 01:05:18.758
SAM: I'm just saying, if we're going to be here
for longer than two hours and we don't want to

01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:20.724
keep recasting, we could maybe see if--

01:05:20.724 --> 01:05:22.970
TRAVIS: We could just beat the shit out of Beau
and we'll be fine.

01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:24.587
MARISHA: I'm so down to be scummy.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:29.534
LIAM: Let's be clear about our goals here, though.
We were going to get something to ride, and leave. <i>Ja</i>?

01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:30.272
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:05:30.272 --> 01:05:31.045
LIAM: Okay.

01:05:31.045 --> 01:05:35.388
MATT: Caduceus. While they're having this
conversation, you're looking around the space, and

01:05:35.388 --> 01:05:40.148
you look back and that big minotaur that you guys
were following is now walking straight towards you.

01:05:40.152 --> 01:05:40.919
SAM: Oh, god!

01:05:40.919 --> 01:05:42.622
MARISHA: What do you mean? Oh, god!

01:05:42.622 --> 01:05:44.155
TRAVIS: I don't want to be here!

01:05:44.155 --> 01:05:47.230
TALIESIN: You guys don't know anything yet. We've
got company.

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:53.020
SAM: Let's go see if there's someone working at
the livery. Is there a hut?

01:05:54.210 --> 01:06:01.148
MATT: There's the large pen, and there is a
40-foot-wide structure; rough, thatched roof

01:06:01.148 --> 01:06:06.444
that's been treated with some sort of a heavy muck
and/or possibly creature mucus to give it a shiny,

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:14.867
rain-proof exterior. The front has a door. It's a
rough-looking door, that's rounded at the top and

01:06:14.867 --> 01:06:22.541
doesn't fit properly into the entire entryway, but
it seems functional. Do you walk towards the livery?

01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:24.568
SAM: Yeah, that's why we're here.

01:06:24.568 --> 01:06:26.151
LAURA: I'm staring at the minotaur.

01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:31.142
MATT: You guys move towards the livery, he curves
and follows. He's beelining towards you.

01:06:31.142 --> 01:06:37.550
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. I'm going to acknowledge with a
bow, once I notice that he's moving towards us.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.297
LAURA: I'm going to smile and then remember that
I'm goth and go--

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.692
TALIESIN: That's much better.

01:06:42.692 --> 01:06:47.405
MATT: He approaches. Only two of the Kryn soldiers
that were with him are now at his sides; the rest

01:06:47.405 --> 01:06:52.386
have gone inside the Aurora Hold, which seems to
have been his destination until someone had taken note.

01:06:52.386 --> 01:06:55.433
TRAVIS: I wish we had planned out a story before
we came in here.

01:06:55.433 --> 01:06:56.716
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, yep.

01:06:56.716 --> 01:07:04.895
MATT: He approaches and stops maybe ten feet from
you, towering over your lot. About your height.

01:07:04.895 --> 01:07:10.814
Maybe a little bit taller, but much wider, and
burly. As soon as his final hoof-fall hits the mud--

01:07:12.004 --> 01:07:14.099
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm feeling the physical
aggression?

01:07:14.099 --> 01:07:16.029
MATT: Just a presence.

01:07:16.439 --> 01:07:19.712
TALIESIN: I'll give it to him. I'll get a little
shorter.

01:07:21.532 --> 01:07:25.740
MATT: "I must admit I have not seen you within
this city before."

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.751
TALIESIN: This is our first time here.

01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:38.611
MATT: "So color me curious. What is your business,
and whom do you serve?"

01:07:40.011 --> 01:07:47.931
TALIESIN: May I, or do you want to? Our business
is we're looking to collect some transport, maybe

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:53.780
do a little trade while we're in town, and head on
our way. As to our service, we are private

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:59.639
contractors on what I will say, of the many
missions that we've put forward, is one of our

01:07:59.639 --> 01:08:03.672
truer, more noble missions at this point.

01:08:03.672 --> 01:08:06.351
MATT: "Contractors? What is your business?"

01:08:06.351 --> 01:08:09.799
TALIESIN: Whatever we're being contracted for. At
this point, just--

01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:11.693
MATT: "Sellswords?"

01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:12.836
TALIESIN: Sometimes.

01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:14.200
TRAVIS: Smugglers.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.397
TALIESIN: Sometimes.

01:08:15.397 --> 01:08:16.870
MATT: "From where do you hail?"

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:18.240
TALIESIN: Everywhere.

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:19.900
LAURA: All over, really.

01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.375
TRAVIS: Nogvurot, for me, yeah.

01:08:22.075 --> 01:08:24.301
MATT: I need you both to make deception checks.

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.040
TALIESIN: Is that deception?

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.030
MATT: You're definitely not from all over. You're
from one place.

01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:34.162
TALIESIN: That's fair. 19.

01:08:34.392 --> 01:08:35.150
TRAVIS: 17.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:42.866
MATT: Okay. Looks squarely at each of you as you
say this, and turns the nose up a bit and gives a

01:08:42.866 --> 01:08:47.543
very brief nod. You hear the plates of the metal
creaking as he shifts the weight from one hoof

01:08:47.543 --> 01:08:48.403
to the other.

01:08:48.403 --> 01:08:52.214
TALIESIN: That is beautiful, by the way, I've
never seen anything like it before.

01:08:52.264 --> 01:08:55.482
MATT: "And you never will. Handmade."

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:57.372
TALIESIN: Gorgeous.

01:08:59.272 --> 01:09:03.981
LAURA: By who? A really powerful artisan master
smith and stuff?

01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:06.314
TRAVIS: You're gothing. You're gothing real good.

01:09:06.314 --> 01:09:08.413
LAURA: I'm going on gothing as I'm doing it.

01:09:08.413 --> 01:09:09.867
SAM: She's not moving her jaw.

01:09:09.867 --> 01:09:13.821
MATT: "It was crafted from a sister of my house in
celebration of my near-umavi ascension."

01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:18.210
SAM: Near-umavi ascension?

01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:23.132
MATT: "You're definitely not from around here, are
you?"

01:09:23.132 --> 01:09:24.480
TALIESIN: Very much not.

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:30.841
MATT: "Well. Sellswords, if you're looking for
work, there is work here in these lands in a time

01:09:30.841 --> 01:09:37.780
"of war. If you can carry a blade, while we send
most of our able-bodied soldiers to the front

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:46.681
"line, cleanup is a bit of a problem here at home.
I would say talk to Lady Zethriss Olios within the

01:09:46.681 --> 01:09:49.507
"Aurora Hold if you are looking for contracted
work."

01:09:49.787 --> 01:09:51.083
SAM: Say that name again?

01:09:51.753 --> 01:09:53.145
MATT: "Zethriss Olios."

01:09:53.795 --> 01:09:56.181
TALIESIN: That is very generous of you.

01:09:57.061 --> 01:10:01.378
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. Forgive our impertinence, we
didn't ask for your name.

01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:07.292
MATT: Gives you a look like-- you can see in the
way the head turns like, you don't know my name?

01:10:07.292 --> 01:10:15.201
He goes, "I have had many names through many
lives, but the one I take now is Sunbreaker Oloman."

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:17.416
MARISHA: Sunbreaker Olman?

01:10:17.536 --> 01:10:18.465
LIAM: Oloman.

01:10:19.205 --> 01:10:20.173
LAURA: Almond.

01:10:20.173 --> 01:10:23.581
SAM: And is there a Mrs. Sunbreaker, or--?

01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:26.722
TRAVIS: Are you flirting with the fucking
minotaur?

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:28.385
SAM: He is fucking hot.

01:10:28.385 --> 01:10:32.353
(laughter)

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:35.059
SAM: And, you know, 50/50 my husband's dead, so.

01:10:35.059 --> 01:10:39.757
(shocked laughter)

01:10:39.757 --> 01:10:43.661
TRAVIS: Wow! We've been sending him messages every
night.

01:10:43.661 --> 01:10:46.044
LIAM: Risking our lives behind enemy lines.

01:10:46.044 --> 01:10:54.151
MATT: The massive minotaur looks down at the
goblin with a curled eyebrow and goes, "Heh. No."

01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:56.124
SAM: Hmm.

01:10:57.364 --> 01:11:01.461
MATT: "Well, don't make any messes," and he turns
around.

01:11:01.477 --> 01:11:05.719
TALIESIN: Pleasure. I like it here.

01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:08.036
LAURA: Did you see the way? I think he winked at
you. I think I saw--

01:11:08.036 --> 01:11:09.367
SAM: I couldn't tell--

01:11:09.367 --> 01:11:10.675
TALIESIN: I thought he winked at me, but that's
fine.

01:11:10.778 --> 01:11:12.335
SAM: -- through his piercing eyes.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:17.569
LIAM: Those were his horns, were piercing. His
horns, Nott.

01:11:17.569 --> 01:11:19.136
SAM: Yeah. He was horny.

01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:20.154
LIAM: Stay on task.

01:11:20.154 --> 01:11:21.337
SAM: Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:11:21.337 --> 01:11:23.726
TRAVIS: How much time, Keen Mind?

01:11:23.726 --> 01:11:25.663
LIAM: About 15 to 20?

01:11:25.663 --> 01:11:27.277
MATT: At this point, about 15 minutes or so before
it--

01:11:27.277 --> 01:11:28.957
TALIESIN: Let's head into the liv--

01:11:28.957 --> 01:11:29.638
TRAVIS: Livery.

01:11:29.638 --> 01:11:32.018
TALIESIN: Livery and see if there's a
conversation.

01:11:32.018 --> 01:11:33.449
SAM: What was his name? Oloman.

01:11:33.449 --> 01:11:34.967
LAURA: Olman? Olmin?

01:11:34.967 --> 01:11:36.998
MATT and LAURA: Oloman.

01:11:36.998 --> 01:11:39.001
LIAM: Nottbreaker Oloman.

01:11:39.001 --> 01:11:42.971
(laughter)

01:11:42.971 --> 01:11:44.042
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:11:44.042 --> 01:11:44.800
MATT: Anyway.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.660
SAM: Saddle up!

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.991
(laughter)

01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:52.481
TRAVIS and SAM: Like a gerbil on a banana.

01:11:52.481 --> 01:11:55.480
TALIESIN: Once again, Sam has ruined tomorrow
morning's Twitter.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:58.015
LIAM: DM's as red as his t-shirt.

01:12:00.145 --> 01:12:09.861
MATT: Never underestimate the players' ability to
fuck with you. You approach the wide structure

01:12:09.861 --> 01:12:17.037
that sits affixed to this large pen where these
creatures are currently held. The smell is strong.

01:12:17.037 --> 01:12:24.573
It's a combination of the fur, the dung, and this
heavy, acrid smell that you can only attribute to--

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:25.472
LIAM: Cat piss.

01:12:25.472 --> 01:12:34.441
MATT: -- heavy, long-soaked piss. You enter
the interior of the building. You can see a series

01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:39.425
of goblins that are in the process of lounging,
not doing their jobs. They're sitting there,

01:12:39.425 --> 01:12:44.910
drinking these little wooden cups of some sort of
a liquid, they're talking amongst themselves. You

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:51.449
catch the tail end of the conversation, Nott. One
of them's saying, "This whole thing is being

01:12:51.449 --> 01:12:57.204
ridiculous. Everyone's just taking stuff and not
really paying for it." As soon as you guys walk in

01:12:57.204 --> 01:13:04.183
they all (grunt) and sit upright, and all look over
on the opposite end. You see, turning from the

01:13:04.183 --> 01:13:17.267
opposite side, this would be... perfect. An older
goblin, probably later in his years. A bit rotund,

01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:23.392
this puff of gray-white hair that sits at the back
of the head and the front of it's just bald

01:13:23.392 --> 01:13:30.126
entirely. Liver spots on the face. Long nose that
comes to a gradual point towards the ground.

01:13:30.396 --> 01:13:37.500
Bulbous chin. Looks like Meg Mucklebones from
Legend, but much smaller and a dude.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.976
LIAM: "Older in his years," does that mean he's
like 15, 16?

01:13:41.846 --> 01:13:43.930
MATT: Pushing 20, maybe 25.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:45.838
(oohing)

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.299
TALIESIN: He's seen some shit.

01:13:48.369 --> 01:14:03.273
MATT: This figure is missing both arms. Has a
really nice, somewhat dirty vest over no shirt. Has

01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:08.080
a pair of slacks rolled up towards the knee, and
bare feet walking that are black on the bottom.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:14.828
The long, dirty toenails haven't been clipped in a
while, and hook over the front of the toes. You can

01:14:14.828 --> 01:14:20.352
see him reaching up with one leg, and finishes
wrapping a rope around some pole leaning on the

01:14:20.352 --> 01:14:26.840
edge. He turns the rest of you and goes, "Hello,
there! You coming to do business, eh?"

01:14:29.301 --> 01:14:36.353
SAM: You're on fire tonight. Hello, old timer!

01:14:36.813 --> 01:14:41.281
MATT: "Oh, hi there, little girl! Nice to
see you!"

01:14:45.531 --> 01:14:47.578
SAM: Pleasant day we're having here.

01:14:48.278 --> 01:14:50.540
MATT: "Quite pleasant indeed!"

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.060
SAM: Do you manage these stables here?

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.499
MATT: "Aye, welcome to Zorth's Pits! I'm Zorth."

01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:57.592
SAM: Zorth?

01:14:57.592 --> 01:14:58.558
MATT: "Yeah!"

01:14:59.038 --> 01:14:59.865
LIAM: Zorth.

01:14:59.865 --> 01:15:01.126
MARISHA: Zorth's pit?

01:15:03.816 --> 01:15:06.119
SAM: Family business? Are these your kin?

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:11.639
MATT: "No! They're a bunch of pissants!" And they
kind of (goblin yelping) scatter. One of them

01:15:11.639 --> 01:15:19.009
starts carefully stepping into the pen with a
cluster of maybe not-the-freshest meat but is

01:15:19.009 --> 01:15:23.251
standing before them and tossing them. You hear
(snarling) and immediately the goblin runs

01:15:23.251 --> 01:15:29.577
outside. Looks back at the rest of you, "Here we
got the best beasts in the land. You looking to

01:15:29.577 --> 01:15:30.640
"buy something, huh?"

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:39.567
SAM: (stuttering) We are. Or at least rent. Lease?
Borrow?

01:15:39.567 --> 01:15:40.675
LAURA: Loan, maybe.

01:15:40.675 --> 01:15:50.492
SAM: Yes, we've been taking a look at your stock
here. I'm from the south of Xhorhas, so I'm not

01:15:50.492 --> 01:15:54.296
familiar with the animals up here. The...?

01:15:54.296 --> 01:15:55.926
MATT: "Moorbounders!"

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.335
SAM: Maulbounders?

01:15:57.335 --> 01:15:59.088
MATT: "Moorbounders!"

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:03.599
SAM: Moorbounders. That's the longer,
panther-like?

01:16:03.599 --> 01:16:06.127
MATT: "Yeah, they're from the swamps in the
south."

01:16:06.127 --> 01:16:08.084
SAM: That's why I was familiar with them.

01:16:08.084 --> 01:16:11.558
MATT: "That's where you said you were from. You
don't know what they are?"

01:16:11.558 --> 01:16:14.129
SAM: Well, we call them something different down
there.

01:16:14.129 --> 01:16:15.556
MATT: "What do you call them?"

01:16:15.556 --> 01:16:18.328
SAM: We call them... swamp panthers.

01:16:20.721 --> 01:16:25.860
MATT: It's not very imaginative. And not accurate
either.

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:28.626
SAM: No. No, well that's why--

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:34.406
MATT: "Who am I to judge? A nice young lady coming
in here to do some business. Now I'm not going to

01:16:34.406 --> 01:16:39.172
"lie, these aren't cheap. And looking at the bunch
of you, I don't know if they're in your wheelhouse

01:16:39.172 --> 01:16:43.645
"to afford it. But you know? Let's give it a try
anyway. What are you looking for? How many you

01:16:43.645 --> 01:16:44.820
"looking to buy, huh?"

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:51.823
SAM: How many would we need? Can each one carry
more than one?

01:16:52.363 --> 01:16:56.784
MATT: "Well if you're included, then you'll
probably fit three on one of them. For the average

01:16:56.784 --> 01:17:02.565
"sized folk-- Oh, look at this big fellow right
here! He's pushing-- maybe two at most with him on

01:17:02.565 --> 01:17:06.933
"there, but you know... conservatively saying."
(giggles)

01:17:06.933 --> 01:17:15.192
SAM: My face is covered in spittle. You had
other creatures here, too, did you not? Are

01:17:15.192 --> 01:17:16.920
there larger creatures?

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.966
MATT: "No, just them."

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:21.206
SAM: Oh. Didn't we see some larger beasts of
burden?

01:17:21.206 --> 01:17:23.103
MATT: Those were other places.

01:17:23.103 --> 01:17:25.607
SAM: Oh, okay. Okay--

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:28.203
LAURA: How much are we talking for one?

01:17:29.123 --> 01:17:33.765
MATT: "For one? Well let's see, prices have been
going up since they've been buying them off me

01:17:33.765 --> 01:17:39.141
"left and right for the war parties, so pushing
about five hundred gold apiece."

01:17:39.141 --> 01:17:40.642
LIAM and TALIESIN: Oof.

01:17:41.652 --> 01:17:45.787
MATT: "They're dangerous, they're quick; faster
than any riding horse you've ever seen!"

01:17:46.727 --> 01:17:49.587
TRAVIS: Single saddles, or do you sell custom
double saddles?

01:17:49.587 --> 01:17:53.911
MATT: "They can jump thirty feet in a single
bounce! Not needing any sort of run up at all!"

01:17:53.911 --> 01:17:58.246
TRAVIS: (laughing) I don't know why I'm trying to
drink right now. That's a fucking mistake.

01:17:58.246 --> 01:18:02.510
MATT: "Hopping down trees, mountains, rocks,
whatever you need. Cliff sides? No problem.

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:03.872
"They'll take you there."

01:18:05.642 --> 01:18:10.905
SAM: (like Zorth) How's the resale value on these?
Sorry, sorry! (normal voice) Sorry. How's the

01:18:10.905 --> 01:18:16.292
resale value if we bought these? Could we sell
them in another town for almost as much?

01:18:16.402 --> 01:18:21.016
MATT: "If you've got a good enough sales plan and
you're very convincing, probably. But treat them

01:18:21.016 --> 01:18:27.342
"well, push them, feed them, don't let them kill
and eat you, I think you'll be good."

01:18:27.342 --> 01:18:29.748
LIAM: Is this happening in Common?

01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:30.751
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:18:30.751 --> 01:18:32.711
LIAM: Is this Goblin or Common?

01:18:33.071 --> 01:18:38.099
MATT: This is Common, because it was a mixed group
that came in here. Has not slipped anything

01:18:38.099 --> 01:18:40.010
Goblin-wise to you directly yet.

01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.928
LIAM: Okay.

01:18:41.798 --> 01:18:44.524
LAURA: That's a lot. I don't know if we could
afford that.

01:18:44.524 --> 01:18:47.709
SAM: How many do you think we would need, do you
think? Three, four?

01:18:47.709 --> 01:18:49.139
LAURA: One, two, three.

01:18:49.139 --> 01:18:54.002
SAM: They can each hold two, fully grown. What
about this big fellow here?

01:18:54.102 --> 01:18:58.346
MATT: "That's what I'm saying! He's probably
pushing it to two tops. Maybe three if you're

01:18:58.346 --> 01:19:02.867
"included. You're also a big one. You're pretty
tiny. You'll probably do that, eh?"

01:19:02.867 --> 01:19:05.186
SAM: We can get away with three of them, maybe.

01:19:05.186 --> 01:19:07.442
LAURA: We could probably get away with two.

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:08.287
SAM: Two?

01:19:08.287 --> 01:19:10.329
TALIESIN: No, no. No, we need three.

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:11.922
LIAM: Excuse me, my good sir.

01:19:11.922 --> 01:19:13.686
MATT: "Yes, of course, what's your name?"

01:19:13.686 --> 01:19:14.548
LIAM: Gorth.

01:19:14.598 --> 01:19:21.334
MATT: "Gorth? (laughs) Pleasure to meet you. I'm
Zorth. Our names rhyme. That's silly."

01:19:21.334 --> 01:19:23.719
LIAM: That is a coincidence, <i>ja</i>.

01:19:24.429 --> 01:19:25.838
MATT: "Doesn't happen often."

01:19:25.838 --> 01:19:26.601
LIAM: No.

01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:28.015
MATT: "Tickles me belly."

01:19:29.425 --> 01:19:37.405
LIAM: Doesn't seem very remarkable to me. I wanted
to ask you: how hard are these creatures to pick

01:19:37.405 --> 01:19:42.679
up mastering them and riding them? Can you just
pick it up or is it a learning curve?

01:19:42.679 --> 01:19:48.517
MATT: "Nah, I'll probably have to give you some
sort of seminar when you purchase them. But that's

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:53.015
"part of the purchasing price. Get a chance to set
you down and we'll go over the basics of

01:19:53.015 --> 01:19:58.724
"maintenance, and hey, give them a name, get them
used to you. Just a few hours of training and I

01:19:58.724 --> 01:20:00.154
"think we'll be good, yeah?"

01:20:00.154 --> 01:20:05.418
LIAM: A few hours. But, just maybe one of us per
creature, per beast, who knows how to manage it?

01:20:05.418 --> 01:20:09.999
MATT: "Preferably, yeah. It needs to bond to one
individual. Two, and it might get confusing. And

01:20:09.999 --> 01:20:14.467
"then it might pick one over the other one day, and
then eat the head off of the one it doesn't

01:20:14.467 --> 01:20:18.520
"decide, you know. If you didn't do it right. So
you've got to be careful. (chuckles)"

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.996
LIAM: Well, you know, I am good with cats, so this
is sounding good to me.

01:20:21.996 --> 01:20:24.760
MATT: "Oh, perfect! It's meant to be! How many you
buying?"

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:30.578
SAM: Zorth, you said that fighting forces were
coming to take these from you.

01:20:30.578 --> 01:20:33.723
MATT: "Well, they purchased a few. We've been
trying to keep up."

01:20:33.723 --> 01:20:36.807
SAM: They're not paying full retail, though, are
they?

01:20:36.807 --> 01:20:38.079
TRAVIS: Here it comes.

01:20:38.079 --> 01:20:42.955
MATT: "They're paying what they are supposed to
pay, seeing as how they're keeping us safe from

01:20:42.955 --> 01:20:46.445
"all the fucking bastards over the Ashkeepers, the
way--"

01:20:46.445 --> 01:20:50.448
SAM: And more power to them. I hope they kill
those Empire scum, but--

01:20:50.448 --> 01:20:51.919
MATT: "Damn right!"

01:20:51.919 --> 01:20:57.328
SAM: But, I hope, also, that you've been giving
them the best of your stock to fight in the front lines.

01:20:57.568 --> 01:21:02.148
MATT: "Well, all we keep is good stock! I mean, to
be honest, the ones that don't grow up perfect

01:21:02.148 --> 01:21:07.267
"tend to get eaten by the first. So, you know,
the ones that survive, they're usually

01:21:07.267 --> 01:21:09.016
the best stock regardless."

01:21:10.926 --> 01:21:19.343
SAM: All right, I'll switch to Goblin. All right,
listen: Goblin to goblin, if we buy three of

01:21:19.343 --> 01:21:22.668
these, couldn't you cut your fellow gobbie
a deal here?

01:21:22.668 --> 01:21:24.921
MATT: (chuckles) Make a persuasion check.

01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:27.998
(laughter)

01:21:27.998 --> 01:21:34.292
SAM: Okay, persuasion? Ooh, there's no minus.
So that's 15.

01:21:34.292 --> 01:21:35.194
LAURA: Ooh.

01:21:35.194 --> 01:21:39.666
MATT: Okay. He goes, "Mmm..."

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:44.937
SAM: I can throw in a tiny statue of a dick!

01:21:44.937 --> 01:21:47.697
(laughter)

01:21:47.697 --> 01:21:49.454
SAM: A one-of-a-kind dick statue.

01:21:49.454 --> 01:21:50.742
MATT: Leans in close.

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:54.719
SAM: And?

01:21:54.719 --> 01:21:57.446
LAURA: And we can't understand! We just see her
pull out a dick!

01:21:57.446 --> 01:22:00.076
(laughter)

01:22:00.076 --> 01:22:04.729
SAM: This was actually a petrified dick.

01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:06.230
MATT: "Really? Of what?"

01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:10.532
SAM: Of a tiny, tiny human, an ancestral human--

01:22:10.532 --> 01:22:11.355
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:22:11.475 --> 01:22:13.841
SAM: That we found in a mine somewhere.

01:22:13.841 --> 01:22:15.466
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:22:15.466 --> 01:22:18.269
(laughter)

01:22:18.269 --> 01:22:23.254
SAM: Nope. Well, no, it's there. Persuasion?

01:22:23.254 --> 01:22:24.358
MATT: Deception.

01:22:24.358 --> 01:22:25.310
SAM: Deception.

01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:27.245
(laughter)

01:22:27.245 --> 01:22:28.179
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:22:28.179 --> 01:22:29.949
SAM: Wait, where's that? Ooh, 11.

01:22:30.609 --> 01:22:33.869
MATT: "Eh, seems about right. I mean, no offense.
(bawdy chuckle)"

01:22:33.869 --> 01:22:38.945
(laughter)

01:22:38.945 --> 01:22:40.839
SAM: I know, right? Humans.

01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:41.944
MATT: "Funny."

01:22:41.944 --> 01:22:43.294
TRAVIS: You live with that.

01:22:43.294 --> 01:22:46.040
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Oh, I know.

01:22:47.575 --> 01:22:53.233
MATT: "I'll tell you what. We can work
for trade."

01:22:54.013 --> 01:22:56.020
SAM: What kind of trade are we talking?

01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:01.768
MATT: "Hey, hey! Get--" Well, he can't actually do
that; he doesn't have a hand.

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:03.948
MATT: He actually snaps with his toes. "Hey!"

01:23:03.948 --> 01:23:06.889
(laughter)

01:23:06.889 --> 01:23:12.539
MATT: He's awesome! He is <i>super</i> dexterous with
his feet. "I'm having a conversation! With some

01:23:12.539 --> 01:23:22.268
"prospective clients." And they all scutter off
into a back room and close the little door. "I'm

some chains. And if you'd be interested, maybe you

what the problem is. Maybe <i>kill it</i> and I'll take

"your price down."

01:24:16.374 --> 01:24:17.502
SAM: How much down?

01:24:17.502 --> 01:24:18.596
LAURA: (whispers) Free.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:20.457
MATT: "You're looking to buy how many?"

01:24:20.457 --> 01:24:21.378
SAM: Three.

01:24:21.738 --> 01:24:26.925
MATT: "You do this for me, I'll give you all three
for 750 gold."

01:24:27.745 --> 01:24:28.858
SAM: Half price?

01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:30.519
MATT: "Half price."

01:24:30.519 --> 01:24:32.697
SAM: Let me confer with my fellows.

01:24:32.697 --> 01:24:35.009
MATT: "Yeah, of course! Go for it! (chuckles)"

01:24:35.009 --> 01:24:40.358
SAM: All right, I will convey what was said. What
do you guys think? Should we-- oh, shit!

01:24:40.358 --> 01:24:42.524
Hold on... Hey!

01:24:42.524 --> 01:24:43.331
MATT: "Yeah?"

01:24:43.751 --> 01:24:50.269
SAM: Is the monster, or the nest, the place where
we would be going, within the confines of this

01:24:50.269 --> 01:24:51.748
city here, or outside the city?

01:24:51.748 --> 01:24:54.078
MATT: "No, it's here beneath the actual
premises."

01:24:54.078 --> 01:24:56.483
SAM: Oh, it's right here? Okay, cool. Back in a
few.

01:24:56.483 --> 01:24:57.848
MARISHA: Sounds unsafe.

01:24:58.128 --> 01:24:59.626
TRAVIS: Did he say what it was?

01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:01.223
LIAM: What are you talking about?

01:25:01.223 --> 01:25:05.956
SAM: He wants us to go kill an unknown creature
for him, and he'll knock half the price off.

01:25:05.956 --> 01:25:07.361
TRAVIS: Oh, that's great. Yeah.

01:25:07.361 --> 01:25:09.361
LAURA: That's still a lot of gold, though.

01:25:09.361 --> 01:25:10.522
MARISHA: Two-thirds.

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:13.786
LAURA: I don't know if we can even get that much
gold together.

01:25:13.786 --> 01:25:15.140
TRAVIS: Sure we can.

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:21.803
LAURA: (theatrically) I don't know if we can,
though. We don't have that much gold. Maybe

01:25:21.803 --> 01:25:24.044
he can knock the price down a little bit more!

01:25:24.044 --> 01:25:26.954
TALIESIN: How much gold do we have, I don't
actually--

01:25:26.954 --> 01:25:31.139
LAURA: We don't have a lot of gold with us, you
know? I honestly don't know how much--

01:25:31.749 --> 01:25:36.178
TRAVIS: You know what we should do? We should go
down there and take a look at this beast, and

01:25:36.178 --> 01:25:37.558
we'll decide on the way down.

01:25:37.658 --> 01:25:38.401
SAM: What?

01:25:38.511 --> 01:25:41.811
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's go see what's in this cave
underneath.

01:25:41.811 --> 01:25:43.207
SAM: You just want to go?

01:25:43.207 --> 01:25:43.955
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:49.741
TALIESIN: I was actually going to recommend maybe
we can send our tiny, furry friend down there for

01:25:49.741 --> 01:25:53.584
a little look-see, and then formulate whether or
not this is a good deal or not.

01:25:53.584 --> 01:25:57.290
LIAM: Well, whatever we do, we should do it in the
next six-and-a-half minutes.

01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:06.061
TRAVIS: If we all go down into the cav-ay, then
maybe you can recast-ay the spell-ay.

01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:11.167
LIAM: I did not cast Comprehend Languages; I don't
know what that is, but <i>ja</i>, we could go down

01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:15.424
below just a scooch, and I can do what you're
talking about.

01:26:15.424 --> 01:26:21.906
TALIESIN: I'm sure if we have a conversation about
our individual issues that if anything were to

01:26:21.906 --> 01:26:26.009
arise while we're in here, I think they seem like
an understanding bunch.

01:26:26.009 --> 01:26:32.394
LIAM: I don't know if I have that much coin, but I
have some gems and some other items.

01:26:32.584 --> 01:26:37.491
MATT: "Well, if you don't have any gold to spend,
then why are you coming in here asking to buy things?"

01:26:37.491 --> 01:26:38.967
LAURA and SAM: We do have <i>some</i>!

01:26:38.967 --> 01:26:43.695
SAM: Listen, we've decided to go down and take a
took, assess the situation, and we'll come back

01:26:43.695 --> 01:26:49.149
with our verdict. Does that sound good to you?

01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:55.806
MATT: "I'd kind of prefer a confirmation. It's up to
you."

01:26:55.806 --> 01:27:00.263
SAM: We can agree to do the job right now if you
cut the price down to 400 gold total.

01:27:01.243 --> 01:27:02.112
MATT: "No!"

01:27:02.822 --> 01:27:04.443
MARISHA: (whispering) 500!

01:27:04.443 --> 01:27:06.037
SAM: 500 gold total.

01:27:07.517 --> 01:27:10.690
MATT: "650 gold and that's all."

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:14.131
MARISHA: 600 and a tiny dick statue.

01:27:14.131 --> 01:27:15.571
LAURA: Yeah, that's good.

01:27:15.571 --> 01:27:17.411
SAM: 600 and a tiny dick!

01:27:17.411 --> 01:27:18.061
MATT: "Sold!"

01:27:19.541 --> 01:27:24.062
SAM: I hold out my leg and say: Shake on it!

01:27:25.962 --> 01:27:33.881
MATT: You're fairly dexterous, but it feels like a
handshake. The actual foot curves around, gives it

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:41.031
a hearty shake, and withdraws back and looks at
you all and goes, "So?"

01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:43.394
SAM: I'll leave this for collateral.

01:27:43.574 --> 01:27:48.100
MATT: He plucks it between the two toes and tucks
it into a little pocket in the vest in front.

01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:54.482
TALIESIN: I figure we go down there. If it gets
rough, we'll just make an expeditious retreat.

01:27:54.482 --> 01:27:57.390
LAURA: Is it right there, right where you go down,
or is it--?

01:27:57.390 --> 01:28:00.077
MATT: "It's sort of a-- I'll lead you there."

01:28:00.077 --> 01:28:01.743
TALIESIN: That's awful kind of you.

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:08.037
MATT: "Okay! You ready? All right, come on, follow
me!" Turns around, moves behind where the pen was

01:28:08.037 --> 01:28:12.807
and beyond the door where the goblins were in
there. You can see them peeking out as you guys

01:28:12.807 --> 01:28:18.206
walk by, and they chuckle and giggle behind the
door. Getting a closer look at them, they're younger.

01:28:19.096 --> 01:28:26.963
TALIESIN: Weird question, are they laughing with
us, or at us? Are we being taken? Make a what?

01:28:26.963 --> 01:28:27.962
MATT: Insight check.

01:28:27.962 --> 01:28:33.551
TALIESIN: Insight check. That's good, that
could've been so bad. 21.

01:28:35.921 --> 01:28:38.265
SAM: Whispers! Goblin whispers!

01:28:39.095 --> 01:28:41.860
LIAM: (Liam Neeson accent) Now listen to me very
carefully.

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:48.286
SAM: Guys, D&amp;D Beyond is not aware that I'm
running for president of their organization,

01:28:49.606 --> 01:28:51.687
but you should subscribe to their service.

01:28:52.157 --> 01:28:53.758
TRAVIS: You'll follow up on this?

01:28:53.758 --> 01:28:56.712
TALIESIN: I said I don't follow politics. I was
talking to Sam.

01:28:57.322 --> 01:29:02.657
MATT: On the far end of this chamber, there's a
heavy metal tunnel that curves around the back and

01:29:02.657 --> 01:29:08.921
that leads from where the pen is-- yeah, there you
go-- from the pen reserve, where these creatures

01:29:08.921 --> 01:29:16.412
are being held and tethered, into another back
room. He leads you inside and this is a holding

01:29:16.412 --> 01:29:22.146
area. The breeding grounds are underneath. They're
brought up here and out into the pen as they get

01:29:22.146 --> 01:29:29.169
older, possibly. Inside here, there are large
bundles of food. There are big piles of rolled

01:29:29.169 --> 01:29:38.634
chain that have been coiled, and there is a hatch
that leads into a downward slope. He goes over to

01:29:38.634 --> 01:29:44.110
it, opens the hatch, and goes, "All right, come
on. Follow me," and heads down into the darkness.

01:29:44.110 --> 01:29:45.470
TRAVIS: We follow.

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:46.881
TALIESIN: I cast Light.

01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:52.396
MATT: All right, the light emanates. The smell
down here is <i>worse</i> than the interior because

01:29:52.396 --> 01:30:03.552
it's a combination of the moorbounder shit, it's a
combination of rot, like rotting-corpse rot. The

01:30:03.552 --> 01:30:08.186
chamber curves a little bit, then goes straight,
and then it splits off into two. There are two

01:30:08.186 --> 01:30:18.589
doors: heavy iron doors. One of them has a small
barricade that's slipped in on the right side. The

01:30:18.589 --> 01:30:23.722
one on the left side has multiple pieces of metal
pushed and propped up against it, chains wrapped

01:30:23.722 --> 01:30:30.336
around it, and a series of other poles and tools
and things that are pushed up to try and keep it

01:30:30.336 --> 01:30:34.783
closed and at bay, as well as other furniture
thrust against it. You can see that it's been

01:30:34.783 --> 01:30:36.255
pushed back a little bit.

01:30:36.835 --> 01:30:41.838
TRAVIS: If you don't mind me asking, did you get a
good look at it before you barricaded this entry point?

01:30:41.838 --> 01:30:47.987
MATT: "No! I went in there and saw that that the--
well, one of my litters was being eaten, and then

01:30:47.987 --> 01:30:50.477
"it made a bunch of noises and then I ran."

01:30:50.477 --> 01:30:52.198
TRAVIS: You just heard it, right?

01:30:52.198 --> 01:30:55.294
MATT: "Yeah, I'm not going to-- you see what I
have to work with!"

01:30:55.294 --> 01:31:01.928
SAM: Were the noises more squawks and shrieks? Or
barks or growls?

01:31:03.378 --> 01:31:08.111
MATT: "Small, angry squeaks, and then a big
growl."

01:31:09.191 --> 01:31:10.718
SAM: Will you be coming with us?

01:31:10.718 --> 01:31:11.614
MATT: "No!"

01:31:12.524 --> 01:31:13.484
SAM: All right.

01:31:14.534 --> 01:31:18.896
TRAVIS: This doesn't seem like too big of a deal.
I think we'll be just fine.

01:31:19.446 --> 01:31:27.526
LAURA: Pop in, kill the thing, and then pop on
out. Are any of them in there?

01:31:28.236 --> 01:31:32.671
MATT: "Unfortunately, not in that one. The one on
the right is where the litter's being raised

01:31:32.671 --> 01:31:39.165
"currently. The one in there, not doing too well."
He bows his head sadly for a moment.

01:31:39.955 --> 01:31:41.294
LAURA: That's really sad.

01:31:41.294 --> 01:31:43.546
MATT: "But hey, that's life in the wastes."

01:31:44.026 --> 01:31:47.590
LIAM: So you're just going to wait here on
tippy-toe while we go in?

01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:50.583
MATT: "Yeah! Do I listen in?"

01:31:50.583 --> 01:31:56.947
TRAVIS: Actually, we'd prefer to work in a little
bit of silence. If you'll just wait for us up top,

01:31:56.947 --> 01:31:58.766
we'll take care of this lickety-split.

01:31:58.766 --> 01:32:02.698
MATT: "All right. Okay, I accept your terms."

01:32:03.593 --> 01:32:04.630
SAM: See you soon.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:11.012
MATT: He goes over and pulls a key out of his
pocket with his right foot, deftly unlocks one of

01:32:11.012 --> 01:32:18.222
the locks, pulls the chain off. "That's the big
part. The rest of it is up to you." He scurries up

01:32:18.222 --> 01:32:22.081
the previous chamber and then up the slope and
out of sight.

01:32:22.081 --> 01:32:23.560
MARISHA: Am I still a tiefling?

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.607
LAURA: Should we prep?

01:32:24.607 --> 01:32:26.428
LIAM: We've got about one minute left.

01:32:26.428 --> 01:32:31.090
MARISHA: What's it look like? What's it look like
when I change? Can you see, like, a little bit of

01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:32.362
my features poking through? What happens?

01:32:32.362 --> 01:32:34.367
LIAM: No, it just happens instantaneously.

01:32:34.367 --> 01:32:36.749
MARISHA: Am I getting a little smaller? Oh,
really?

01:32:36.749 --> 01:32:40.137
LAURA: I want to see-- wait! Can I look in your
pants as it's happening?

01:32:40.137 --> 01:32:41.388
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:32:41.388 --> 01:32:42.669
TRAVIS: Fucking ridiculous.

01:32:42.669 --> 01:32:45.480
MATT: You watch as the Polymorph wears off.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.790
LIAM: (counting down)

01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:51.829
TRAVIS: Describe it! Tell us! Does it just
disappear? Does it (slurping)?

01:32:51.829 --> 01:32:53.662
MATT: It reverts.

01:32:53.662 --> 01:32:54.765
LIAM: Two, one.

01:32:54.765 --> 01:32:55.960
TALIESIN: Happy New Year!

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.245
MATT: (slurp) There you go.

01:32:57.245 --> 01:32:58.488
TRAVIS: I was in the pool!

01:32:58.488 --> 01:32:59.821
LIAM: Oh, for goodness sake!

01:32:59.821 --> 01:33:00.738
SAM: Wow!

01:33:00.738 --> 01:33:04.581
LAURA: I was distracted, I was looking at the
horns! I didn't even see.

01:33:04.581 --> 01:33:06.049
SAM: I saw it! I saw it!

01:33:07.319 --> 01:33:08.359
MARISHA: Okay, sorry.

01:33:08.359 --> 01:33:12.931
TRAVIS: Hey, Ducey. Why don't you come over here
and put your ear on this wall and see if you can

01:33:12.931 --> 01:33:14.105
hear anything.

01:33:14.206 --> 01:33:15.522
TALIESIN: All right.

01:33:15.522 --> 01:33:17.519
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

01:33:17.519 --> 01:33:22.655
TALIESIN: Yeah. Ugh, that's terrible. 12.

01:33:22.948 --> 01:33:28.341
MATT: You don't really hear much, unfortunately.
It's pretty quiet.

01:33:28.341 --> 01:33:30.719
TALIESIN: Might be sleeping.

01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:35.222
TRAVIS: Take your ear away for a second? I'll go
(boom) against the side of it.

01:33:35.222 --> 01:33:36.250
MATT: Okay.

01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:38.000
TRAVIS: Now do you hear anything?

01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:42.650
MATT: I'm going to say both of you guys make a
perception check. You with disadvantage, based on

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:44.273
the failure of the last roll.

01:33:46.523 --> 01:33:47.381
TRAVIS: 17.

01:33:47.381 --> 01:33:48.280
TALIESIN: 15.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:55.018
MATT: Okay. Still hard for you to pick up a little
bit against the door. You hear skittering.

01:33:58.298 --> 01:34:00.576
MARISHA: Yeah. A fucking spider level.

01:34:01.606 --> 01:34:07.141
MATT: Tiny squeaks, some scratching, more
skittering. It's a ways away, a distant echo; and

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:09.714
you're only barely able to make it up
against the door.

01:34:09.714 --> 01:34:14.792
TRAVIS: Yeah, sounds like a bunch of little
things. But he did say a bunch of little squeaks

01:34:14.792 --> 01:34:20.478
and then a roar, so maybe whatever the bigger
thing is has something to clean up the scraps.

01:34:20.478 --> 01:34:24.396
TALIESIN: Or it was the sound of one of the
panther things dying.

01:34:24.396 --> 01:34:29.510
LIAM: Or perhaps we are talking about babies and
mama? Hard to say.

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:37.675
LAURA: Maybe it's a spider, like a giant spider,
that had a nest of baby spiders, so there's like a

01:34:37.675 --> 01:34:40.827
thousand little baby spiders and then one giant
big one?

01:34:40.827 --> 01:34:42.044
TALIESIN: I like spiders.

01:34:42.044 --> 01:34:46.247
SAM: Well, let's go find out! Do we have a
plan of attack?

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:48.653
TRAVIS: Is it supported by poles?

01:34:48.653 --> 01:34:56.437
MATT: There are probably about 20 different poles,
metal bars, pieces of heavy furniture leaned up

01:34:56.437 --> 01:35:02.130
against it. Whatever he and his goblin troupe were
able to muster they pushed up against this door to

01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:04.526
ensure that whatever was in there did not
come out.

01:35:04.526 --> 01:35:07.098
TRAVIS: And it looks like it's been hitting
against it?

01:35:07.098 --> 01:35:07.939
MATT: Yeah.

01:35:07.939 --> 01:35:08.701
MARISHA: Oh.

01:35:08.701 --> 01:35:13.319
MATT: It looks like some of the poles have been
pushed into the ground a bit, and there's a slight

01:35:13.319 --> 01:35:17.358
gap at the top where the door looks like it's
maybe pushed a little out of its hinges.

01:35:17.358 --> 01:35:19.523
TRAVIS: Good deal, good deal.

01:35:20.023 --> 01:35:29.758
LAURA: I'm going to bless you, and you, and you.
Yeah.

01:35:30.488 --> 01:35:31.510
SAM: All right!

01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:35.980
TALIESIN: Well, actually, do you want to wait
until we're in? Because it's a 60 second-- do you

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.311
want to wait until we're in?

01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:39.028
LAURA: It only lasts for 60 seconds?

01:35:39.028 --> 01:35:41.362
TALIESIN: Yeah. So you want to wait until we're--

01:35:41.362 --> 01:35:42.171
SAM: Let's go in!

01:35:42.171 --> 01:35:43.553
LIAM: We've got to go in now.

01:35:43.553 --> 01:35:45.026
LAURA: Right as we're going in.

01:35:45.026 --> 01:35:47.029
TRAVIS: Yeah, we start removing the poles.

01:35:47.029 --> 01:35:51.415
MATT: Okay. Yasha helps you and it takes-- it
doesn't take too long. Yasha's peeling them off

01:35:51.415 --> 01:35:56.032
the door and between the two of you and anybody
else who wants to help you, you manage to get to a

01:35:56.032 --> 01:36:00.322
point where the door eventually (creaks) hangs
open a little bit. The top and bottom hinges

01:36:00.322 --> 01:36:05.292
loose. The bottom breaks off entirely, and it
opens up at an angle where now it's longways,

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:08.663
occupying the same jamb where the door
previously was.

01:36:08.663 --> 01:36:12.093
TRAVIS: All right, so instead of a thing, it's
opened its hatch slightly?

01:36:12.093 --> 01:36:15.987
MATT: It's open and slid to one side, so now you
can travel under or over it.

01:36:15.987 --> 01:36:20.605
TRAVIS: That's kind of at our advantage. If you
wanted to, you could float some light down in that

01:36:20.605 --> 01:36:24.651
direction, or send in your little friend to take a
look. I'm looking at you, Widogast.

01:36:24.651 --> 01:36:26.653
LIAM: Yeah, but we're running out of time.

01:36:26.653 --> 01:36:27.706
TRAVIS: Time for what?

01:36:27.706 --> 01:36:30.560
LIAM: She has given her Blessing to some of us,
and that is--

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.039
LAURA: Yeah, right as we go in.

01:36:32.039 --> 01:36:35.132
SAM: She was just saying she was going to do it as
we're going in.

01:36:35.132 --> 01:36:40.582
LIAM: Okay, okay. Oh, my cat. All right! Sending
in Frumpkin.

01:36:40.662 --> 01:36:42.916
MATT: Okay, roll a stealth check for Frumpkin.

01:36:45.075 --> 01:36:54.230
LIAM: Good. Oh, but that's cat stealth, it's 18
plus-- where's my cat? 20.

01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:57.147
MATT: Okay, then roll a perception check for
Frumpkin, please.

01:36:57.497 --> 01:36:58.755
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:36:58.755 --> 01:37:00.262
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:37:00.262 --> 01:37:11.567
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin heads into the chamber. It is
a rough, carved tunnel that descends into a

01:37:11.567 --> 01:37:18.949
subterranean cavern; maybe 50, 60 feet across
before it comes to an end. It's not very wide, and

01:37:18.949 --> 01:37:25.060
it has a small opening towards the beginning,
pinches a bit, and then curves around the side to

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:33.563
end. It is damp, it smells awful, and as Frumpkin,
stepping down into the first area, you can see

01:37:33.563 --> 01:37:39.672
bones scattered across the front area. Small
bones, at least small for the creatures that were

01:37:39.672 --> 01:37:47.009
in here. They look human-sized in their tinier
age, I guess. You see across one cluster, one

01:37:47.009 --> 01:37:59.584
mostly picked-clean body of what may have been a
young moorbounder. Probably 30 or 40 large, crusty

01:37:59.584 --> 01:38:05.625
rats are clustered up over the body. Some of them
are fighting for each other, squeaking at each

01:38:05.625 --> 01:38:10.143
other. Some are looking in the direction of the
sound and the little bit of light that's peeking

01:38:10.143 --> 01:38:14.665
through from the door, that's now been pushed to
the side, and the Light spell that Caduceus has

01:38:14.665 --> 01:38:19.228
been maintaining, and they're all pulling strips
of flesh and whatever remnants they can from the

01:38:19.228 --> 01:38:21.468
bones and the corpse of one of these creatures.

01:38:21.468 --> 01:38:22.973
TRAVIS: When you say large...

01:38:22.973 --> 01:38:24.427
MATT: About that big each.

01:38:24.427 --> 01:38:30.919
LIAM: Hold on, hold on. Looking through Frumpkin's
eyes, I want Frumpkin to look at the ceiling.

01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:39.850
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin looks up at the ceiling, and
there are a few rough bits of rock and stone that

01:38:39.850 --> 01:38:48.575
seem to have, either through ancient seismic
activity, pushed through this cavern. While it was

01:38:48.575 --> 01:38:53.169
partially carved, there were some pieces of heavy
stone that couldn't be carved, and as such they

01:38:53.169 --> 01:39:00.352
protrude and arc down a bit. Looking up, pressed
between where these two stones are jutting out,

01:39:00.352 --> 01:39:06.693
there is some sort of a creature. No details to be
seen, but a large creature that has currently

01:39:06.693 --> 01:39:11.436
pressed all of its limbs against the two sides of
the rocks, and it's suspended looking down.

01:39:11.436 --> 01:39:13.018
LAURA: All of its limbs?

01:39:13.308 --> 01:39:20.330
MATT: You see about four arms or legs. It looks
almost feline-like, from what little details

01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:26.196
Frumpkin can see, pressed American Ninja
Warrior-style into the rocks and is looking down.

01:39:26.196 --> 01:39:31.638
(snarling) A little bit of saliva drips from
above.

01:39:31.638 --> 01:39:33.561
LAURA: Is it very dark in there?

01:39:33.561 --> 01:39:35.426
MATT: There's no light: pitch black.

01:39:35.426 --> 01:39:41.508
LIAM: I ask Frumpkin to slowly, slowly crouch down
low to the ground and back out of the chamber.

01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:56.701
MATT: Okay. (softly) Frumpkin slowly backs out.
(snarling) Backs out, backs out; and then manages

01:39:56.701 --> 01:39:59.549
to come back to the doorway, unnoticed.

01:39:59.549 --> 01:40:08.462
LIAM: I snap him away from the door. He's gone.
Okay, so there's a rat situation. That's one

01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:16.020
thing, a lot of rats. There is a big thing hanging
from the ceiling, looking down at--

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:17.481
LAURA: Like a spider, or what?

01:40:17.481 --> 01:40:26.224
LIAM: No, no. It was muscular; it looked maybe
feline itself. It looks like it is watching the room.

01:40:27.384 --> 01:40:30.337
SAM: Can you send in one of your big balls of
fire?

01:40:30.337 --> 01:40:32.559
LAURA: Straight up to the ceiling or something?

01:40:33.239 --> 01:40:40.798
LIAM: I do not have that ready today because I
thought we would do a little more talking in the city.

01:40:40.798 --> 01:40:42.440
LAURA: That's a bummer.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.736
LIAM: Yeah. Big bummer.

01:40:46.686 --> 01:40:48.086
SAM: I have some oil.

01:40:48.086 --> 01:40:49.712
TALIESIN: I've got some thoughts.

01:40:49.712 --> 01:40:54.568
LAURA: (excited gasp) Fluffernutter!
<i>Fluffernutter</i>!

01:40:54.568 --> 01:40:59.790
SAM: We could do something like Fluffernutter.

01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:01.899
LAURA: Ah!

01:41:02.929 --> 01:41:03.868
SAM: I mean--

01:41:04.698 --> 01:41:07.380
LIAM: Do you think we could make Fireline work
here?

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:08.582
SAM: We could.

01:41:10.432 --> 01:41:12.057
TRAVIS: Fireline? Wall of Fire?

01:41:13.117 --> 01:41:13.974
LIAM: Hmm.

01:41:13.974 --> 01:41:16.499
SAM: I would have to run in, though.

01:41:16.749 --> 01:41:21.357
LIAM: We could tailor it. We could have Frumpkin
do it and keep you safe.

01:41:21.557 --> 01:41:24.697
SAM: Frumpkin can't carry a bottle of oil.

01:41:24.697 --> 01:41:28.850
LIAM: That's true, that's true. What will you do
when you get there, though?

01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:31.318
SAM: Keep running. Hide.

01:41:31.318 --> 01:41:39.211
LIAM: You need to peel away. You need to get up to
that point, douse them, and peel away.

01:41:39.211 --> 01:41:45.300
LAURA: Or we throw in some black powder, and you
shoot it! Fluffernutter!

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.601
SAM: Fluffernutter! I don't have any black
powder.

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:48.667
LAURA: What the fuck?

01:41:48.667 --> 01:41:54.154
SAM: I have a big jar of burning oil, but that's
similar. Similar!

01:41:54.424 --> 01:41:59.956
LIAM: We have a thing we have done before. We
could do it now. We could try it. Better than

01:41:59.956 --> 01:42:03.053
running in. Want to give it a go?

01:42:03.703 --> 01:42:10.301
SAM: Sure. You've been in there, visually. How far
from the entrance is the creature?

01:42:10.301 --> 01:42:18.457
LIAM: It was about midway into the chamber, and
the chamber went back about 60 or so. So 30, 35.

01:42:18.457 --> 01:42:21.919
SAM: Maybe I can use Mage Hand to carry in--

01:42:22.599 --> 01:42:24.106
LIAM: That's even better.

01:42:24.526 --> 01:42:32.566
TRAVIS: What if we could convince this thing to be
a steed? I could try to go in and talk to it.

01:42:32.756 --> 01:42:34.650
SAM: You mean tame the beast?

01:42:34.650 --> 01:42:35.521
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:42:35.521 --> 01:42:38.261
LAURA: What if it's intelligent? What if it's a
human thing?

01:42:38.491 --> 01:42:40.110
TRAVIS: That would be unfortunate.

01:42:40.110 --> 01:42:44.594
TALIESIN: I have not known a lot of positive
instances of getting a wild animal to be all right

01:42:44.594 --> 01:42:45.833
with domestication.

01:42:45.843 --> 01:42:50.555
LIAM: I like this idea because that thing is not
looking for a vial or a jar of anything floating

01:42:50.555 --> 01:42:55.166
through the air. We could drag it along. Then,
like you're cooking, you're seasoning your food,

01:42:55.166 --> 01:42:57.232
you could douse the rats.

01:42:57.232 --> 01:42:59.553
SAM: Go all over the room with it?

01:42:59.553 --> 01:43:04.662
LIAM: Straight line to the rats, then juice the
rats. Then (explosion).

01:43:04.662 --> 01:43:05.562
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:43:06.072 --> 01:43:09.309
SAM: I'm juicing the rats? I'm not juicing the guy
up top?

01:43:09.799 --> 01:43:12.189
LIAM: I have no way to reach the guy up top.

01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:13.822
SAM: Okay. I'll juice the rats.

01:43:13.822 --> 01:43:15.327
TRAVIS: You juice-a the rats-a!

01:43:15.327 --> 01:43:16.655
SAM: I'll juice-a the rats!

01:43:16.695 --> 01:43:18.430
LIAM and TRAVIS: You like-a the juice?

01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:22.145
LIAM: That's a fresh SNL skit from 1980-something.

01:43:22.145 --> 01:43:23.746
TALIESIN: Only the freshest.

01:43:24.186 --> 01:43:25.690
MATT: He'll get you more juice.

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:30.842
SAM: We're going to try something. A set play.

01:43:31.043 --> 01:43:39.119
MATT: Okay. In this moment of intense quiet, as
you gather your supplies to prepare for your plan,

01:43:40.139 --> 01:43:44.363
you take a deep breath. We'll come back at this
moment.

01:43:44.823 --> 01:43:46.130
MARISHA: I knew it!

01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:52.742
MATT: We can take a break now and then jump into
whatever this is going to be when we return. We'll

01:43:52.742 --> 01:43:58.028
be back here in a little bit. We're going to take
a short break, folks. We do have our fantastic

01:43:58.028 --> 01:44:00.073
Wyrmwood giveaway tonight.

01:44:00.073 --> 01:44:02.363
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Wyrmwood!

01:44:03.023 --> 01:44:10.824
MATT: It's so pretty. I'm going to mispronounce
the shit out of this. Padauk? Pad-ock?

01:44:11.754 --> 01:44:13.347
SAM: It's beautiful. It's orange.

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:21.616
MATT: It's a great color. Or as they put it here:
"<i>genus pertocarpus</i>." <i>Pterocarpus</i>, maybe?

01:44:21.616 --> 01:44:28.504
I don't know. I don't try and pronounce things on
this show anymore. I get enough shit as it is. One

01:44:28.504 --> 01:44:33.596
of you lucky winners gets to win this. Since you
are in our Twitch chat, you just have to enter the

01:44:33.596 --> 01:44:39.111
keyword "beasts." Plural, beasts. Once. More than
once and you will be disqualified. Once again,

01:44:39.111 --> 01:44:43.351
it's only for people in the US and Canada,
excluding Quebec, because of dumb laws. We will

01:44:43.351 --> 01:44:46.633
return here with a winner posthaste. See you guys
in a little bit.

01:44:48.083 --> 02:04:31.769
[break]

02:04:32.399 --> 02:04:37.011
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Laura will be
jumping in here in a second. She's taking care of

02:04:37.011 --> 02:04:43.463
baby stuff. In the meantime, we have our winner of
our Wyrmwood giveaway, which is joechasura. I

02:04:43.463 --> 02:04:48.368
believe that's the proper name. Joechasura.
Congratulations! We'll get you your brand new

02:04:48.368 --> 02:04:51.305
spanking Wyrmwood dice box ASAP.

02:04:51.305 --> 02:04:53.092
TRAVIS: You're giving out spankings?

02:04:53.252 --> 02:05:01.218
MATT: You should be so lucky. As you guys begin to
prepare yourselves to enter this chamber--

02:05:01.218 --> 02:05:02.730
SAM: Yee-haw, Matt.

02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:04.240
MATT: Yee-haw, Sam.

02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:07.507
MARISHA: Y'all come back now, you hear?

02:05:07.507 --> 02:05:09.016
MATT: I'm so happy!

02:05:09.016 --> 02:05:10.522
MARISHA: Best idea.

02:05:10.522 --> 02:05:18.590
MATT: It's the best. For you guys, to try and
ascertain what your setup is as you head into this

02:05:18.590 --> 02:05:25.348
chamber, I would like you guys to figure out what
your placement is. If we're at this point here,

02:05:26.438 --> 02:05:27.947
who's going in first?

02:05:29.277 --> 02:05:33.322
SAM: Nott is right at the door because we're going
to try to pull some shit.

02:05:33.322 --> 02:05:37.020
MATT: That would be right at the entrance way,
there. Caleb, you're at the front?

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:44.194
LIAM: Well, I will go to the other side of that
chamber, that hallway.

02:05:44.504 --> 02:05:45.396
MATT: Here?

02:05:45.396 --> 02:05:55.493
LIAM: Yeah, and then take three steps backward.
That's good. I am preparing a Fire Bolt to launch

02:05:55.493 --> 02:05:56.430
at the ground.

02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:58.431
MATT: Three steps back, so we'll put you--

02:05:58.431 --> 02:06:03.939
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, I meant five feet. Yeah.
That's perfect. What is going on?

02:06:03.939 --> 02:06:05.680
SAM: Travis threw food in my mouth.

02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:09.919
MATT: That's Caleb and Nott. Where is everyone
else going?

02:06:10.919 --> 02:06:14.031
TALIESIN: I'd like to be towards the back, but not
at the back.

02:06:15.231 --> 02:06:16.929
MATT: There, maybe?

02:06:16.929 --> 02:06:18.115
TALIESIN: That's good.

02:06:18.355 --> 02:06:20.180
LAURA: Did everybody roll initiative?

02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:23.644
MATT: Not yet. Combat has not yet begun.

02:06:23.644 --> 02:06:29.657
TALIESIN: Who do we want in front? We should
probably put Yasha towards the front, I imagine.

02:06:29.657 --> 02:06:32.017
TRAVIS: I'd like to be up near the front as well.

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:35.865
MATT: We'll put Yasha behind here, and Fjord
there, in front of Caleb.

02:06:35.865 --> 02:06:37.936
LAURA: I guess I'll be next to Caleb.

02:06:38.906 --> 02:06:39.980
MATT: Beau?

02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:46.194
MARISHA: I'll be behind Caleb or near Caleb. Yeah,
that works.

02:06:46.194 --> 02:06:50.522
MATT: Are you keeping your blink dog at bay?

02:06:51.162 --> 02:06:53.705
LAURA: He's going to sit outside for this one.

02:06:53.705 --> 02:07:01.575
MATT: Nugget curls back into the exit portion of
the chamber and (whines).

02:07:02.275 --> 02:07:07.528
LAURA: Don't make any noise. I don't know if he
understands me. He's real cute.

02:07:07.528 --> 02:07:09.830
MATT: He sits there looking at you expectantly.

02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:12.021
SAM: You still have a ferret around your neck?

02:07:12.021 --> 02:07:12.776
LAURA: Yeah.

02:07:12.776 --> 02:07:14.111
SAM: But a goth ferret!

02:07:14.111 --> 02:07:15.061
LAURA: Yeah!

02:07:15.731 --> 02:07:25.632
MATT: A gerret. Mighty Nein, what would you like
to do? From as far as Frumpkin could see from how

02:07:25.632 --> 02:07:32.577
far Frumpkin went into the chamber, that was as
far as it went. That's all you know.

02:07:32.577 --> 02:07:34.294
SAM: The rats were whereabouts?

02:07:34.294 --> 02:07:35.352
MATT: Right there.

02:07:36.962 --> 02:07:39.268
LIAM: That's our only play at the moment.

02:07:39.508 --> 02:07:45.342
SAM: Okay. I'm going to attempt something. It's
definitely going to work and kill everything in

02:07:45.342 --> 02:07:49.237
there in one move! Watch and learn.

02:07:49.237 --> 02:07:50.608
TRAVIS: Sounds confident.

02:07:50.808 --> 02:07:52.994
LIAM: It will flush things out. Here we go.

02:07:53.074 --> 02:08:00.772
SAM: (yelling) Fireline! (normal voice) I don't
yell that. I don't yell Fireline. I whisper: Fireline!

02:08:00.772 --> 02:08:10.481
I cast Mage Hand. I take my purified pot of
burning oil. I had purified some alchemist oil

02:08:10.481 --> 02:08:22.555
before. With the Mage Hand, starting maybe ten
feet from where we are, the hand is going to start

02:08:22.555 --> 02:08:27.078
pouring it out slowly as it carries it down in a
line.

02:08:27.078 --> 02:08:29.643
MATT: (counting) It can get--

02:08:29.723 --> 02:08:31.403
SAM: If I need to, I'll step in--

02:08:31.403 --> 02:08:34.418
MATT: You may have to step in a little closer for
the 30-foot range of Mage Hand. That's about as

02:08:34.418 --> 02:08:35.305
far as you need.

02:08:35.305 --> 02:08:37.813
LIAM: I'm going to step in closer, then, behind
Nott.

02:08:37.863 --> 02:08:42.058
SAM: I'm going to douse the rats, right?

02:08:42.058 --> 02:08:45.782
LIAM: Straight line up to the rats, and then
season them like you're cooking pasta.

02:08:46.562 --> 02:08:48.130
LAURA: Can Nugget fight?

02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:51.724
MATT: Nugget can. Nugget can also die. It's up to
you.

02:08:53.064 --> 02:08:53.960
TALIESIN: Wow!

02:08:53.970 --> 02:08:55.270
TRAVIS: Let Nugget fight!

02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:56.243
LAURA: No, no, no.

02:08:56.253 --> 02:08:57.709
MATT: Just to let you know.

02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:59.210
LAURA: Good to know.

02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:00.425
SAM: God forbid.

02:09:00.655 --> 02:09:01.821
LAURA: Stop it!

02:09:04.301 --> 02:09:05.971
MATT: Some things never change.

02:09:07.641 --> 02:09:12.181
SAM: Going to make a line towards the rats. Then
when it gets around the rats, a bunch of figure

02:09:12.181 --> 02:09:20.042
eights all over the rats, all around. When it
seems like it's out, I'm going to (clicks tongue)

02:09:20.042 --> 02:09:22.340
to Caleb and say: Fireline!

02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:30.861
MATT: The oil vial drifts out, pouring the line.
You hear it scattering across the floor of the

02:09:30.861 --> 02:09:39.200
stone interior cavern, splattering and droplets
hitting the stone. As it pours out, some of the

02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:54.726
rats (hissing) towards the sound. They have a
darkvision of 30 feet, so they see you, Nott. You

02:09:54.726 --> 02:10:01.666
see in a second, all of a sudden, about 14 pairs
of eyes suddenly glow as what little bit of light

02:10:01.666 --> 02:10:06.330
is peeking from the tunnel, behind where Caduceus
has had the spell out, catches the back of their

02:10:06.330 --> 02:10:11.419
retinas. They all gleam in your direction, and
then a few more. There's a large cluster of rats

02:10:11.419 --> 02:10:14.092
over there. Now, I need everyone to roll
initiative.

02:10:14.802 --> 02:10:18.075
LIAM: Is the oil mid-flight at this point?

02:10:18.075 --> 02:10:22.511
MATT: The oil has just reached them and is now
pouring over them. They've noticed Nott, and

02:10:22.511 --> 02:10:26.464
they're starting to scatter as the oil spills in
their direction.

02:10:26.864 --> 02:10:28.666
TALIESIN: That is terrible.

02:10:28.846 --> 02:10:29.804
LIAM: Yep.

02:10:30.854 --> 02:10:33.764
TALIESIN: Going last is probably good as a cleric,
to be fair.

02:10:33.764 --> 02:10:34.764
LAURA: This is true.

02:10:34.764 --> 02:10:37.095
MARISHA: Are we still blessed?

02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:38.387
MATT: You guys are blessed.

02:10:38.387 --> 02:10:40.274
TRAVIS: Does that count for initiative?

02:10:40.274 --> 02:10:45.146
MATT: No, only for attacks and saving throws.
25 to 20?

02:10:45.866 --> 02:10:46.743
LAURA: 24.

02:10:46.853 --> 02:10:47.678
SAM: 22.

02:10:52.358 --> 02:10:53.889
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:10:53.989 --> 02:10:56.144
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a 19.

02:10:58.904 --> 02:11:00.103
MATT: Beau, you're 18?

02:11:00.103 --> 02:11:01.124
MARISHA: Correct.

02:11:07.604 --> 02:11:09.035
MATT: 15 to ten?

02:11:10.345 --> 02:11:11.197
TRAVIS: Ten.

02:11:16.017 --> 02:11:17.333
TALIESIN: This is good.

02:11:17.333 --> 02:11:18.455
MATT: Ten to five?

02:11:18.455 --> 02:11:19.223
LIAM: Five.

02:11:19.303 --> 02:11:26.278
TALIESIN: Six. Clerics at the end are nice because
I can undo anything terrible that happened.

02:11:26.278 --> 02:11:28.668
TRAVIS: Good. Clean up.

02:11:28.948 --> 02:11:34.915
MATT: Top of the round, as soon as you hear the
cluster of hisses and shifting of darkened rat

02:11:34.915 --> 02:11:40.917
bodies in the shadow across the way-- because most
of you have darkvision. Those who don't, there's

02:11:40.917 --> 02:11:45.647
limited light in here. You cannot see really beyond
the threshold of this chamber. Jester, you are first.

02:11:46.097 --> 02:11:47.968
LAURA: Do they know that we're here?

02:11:49.138 --> 02:11:55.499
SAM: The rats do, but that's about it. You're way in
the back, so you might not even see what's going on.

02:11:55.859 --> 02:11:56.747
LAURA: Okay.

02:11:59.897 --> 02:12:01.398
SAM: Prepare something?

02:12:01.398 --> 02:12:07.467
LAURA: Fuck it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to
throw Daylight into the chamber.

02:12:07.977 --> 02:12:09.671
MATT: What's the range on it?

02:12:09.671 --> 02:12:10.964
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

02:12:10.964 --> 02:12:13.347
LAURA: I'm going to put it right on the top of
that little--

02:12:13.907 --> 02:12:21.634
MATT: Right here? Daylight fills the chamber,
revealing the rest of it. You can see where it

02:12:21.634 --> 02:12:26.300
continues and arcs around the way. That's as much
as you can make out from this distance. You don't

02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:30.979
see anything else immediately visible from your
vantage point. The chamber is very bright. It is

02:12:30.979 --> 02:12:36.027
like it's daytime, cloudless sky, within the room.
The rats (snarling).

02:12:36.027 --> 02:12:39.068
LAURA: That's why I did it; I thought they
wouldn't like light.

02:12:46.648 --> 02:12:49.857
MATT: Yeah, there you go. That's your action.

02:12:49.857 --> 02:12:58.248
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, and I already did a spell, so I
can't do my bonus. Yeah, that's going to be my move.

02:12:58.468 --> 02:13:00.434
MATT: You're going to stay where you are?

02:13:00.434 --> 02:13:01.251
LAURA: Yeah.

02:13:01.251 --> 02:13:04.018
MATT: Jester stays there. Next up on that is
Nott.

02:13:06.928 --> 02:13:11.582
SAM: With the light being cast, do I see the thing
that was on the ceiling?

02:13:11.582 --> 02:13:13.072
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:13:13.072 --> 02:13:14.741
SAM: Is this my action to perceive?

02:13:14.741 --> 02:13:18.502
MATT: This is a quick glance upwards. The
Daylight's going to make it a little--

02:13:18.512 --> 02:13:19.219
SAM: Four.

02:13:19.219 --> 02:13:24.976
MATT: You do not. The ceiling itself comes to a
pinch point where a lot of the stones were jutting

02:13:24.976 --> 02:13:31.582
down and creating this-- what would normally be a
15-foot-high ceiling comes down to about ten feet,

02:13:31.582 --> 02:13:36.886
where a lot of these rock shapes are jutting out
from the sides and the ceiling. You do not see the

02:13:36.886 --> 02:13:38.647
creature that was mentioned by Caleb.

02:13:38.647 --> 02:13:40.847
TRAVIS: A reverse crevasse in the ceiling?

02:13:40.847 --> 02:13:47.414
SAM: I'll move forward and to my right, into that
little jut-out area there, or maybe where-- I'm

02:13:47.414 --> 02:13:50.720
looking for a place to hide, so either that
jutted-out area there--

02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:51.997
MATT: Here or over here?

02:13:51.997 --> 02:13:55.849
SAM: If there's a hiding spot where your finger is
right now, that would be great.

02:13:55.849 --> 02:13:57.134
MATT: There might be, yeah.

02:13:57.134 --> 02:13:58.325
SAM: Okay, I'll go there.

02:13:58.325 --> 02:14:03.992
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20. You at least can get
behind the series of natural stone and rock

02:14:03.992 --> 02:14:06.326
formations that cluster on that side of the wall.

02:14:06.326 --> 02:14:12.866
SAM: Bonus action hide. Then hold my action until
I see that creature. I'll hold the crossbow.

02:14:12.866 --> 02:14:15.059
MATT: Okay, ready to shoot it when it appears?

02:14:15.059 --> 02:14:15.775
SAM: Yes.

02:14:15.775 --> 02:14:18.632
MATT: You go it. That ends your turn, Nott. It is
Yasha's go.

02:14:18.632 --> 02:14:25.281
TRAVIS: Yasha would like to use her 40 feet to come
within the cave, all the way in, as far as she can.

02:14:25.281 --> 02:14:27.156
SAM: There's going to be a line of fire.

02:14:27.156 --> 02:14:29.820
MATT: 30, 35, 40 will get her right up to the--

02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:35.717
TRAVIS: Right. Where do the rats start?

02:14:35.737 --> 02:14:37.419
LIAM: Right where Yasha is.

02:14:37.419 --> 02:14:39.319
TRAVIS: Let's back it up ten feet.

02:14:39.609 --> 02:14:41.613
LAURA: Out of the line of fire, basically.

02:14:41.613 --> 02:14:42.792
SAM: Just to the right.

02:14:42.792 --> 02:14:43.857
TRAVIS: To the right?

02:14:43.857 --> 02:14:46.020
SAM: I mean, it's from where I was standing--

02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:50.174
TRAVIS: I'll go protect-- she will protect Nott.
She'll be over there.

02:14:50.174 --> 02:14:54.064
MATT: Yasha steps over and becomes part of the
barrier that's hiding Nott.

02:14:54.124 --> 02:15:00.136
TRAVIS: With her bonus action, she would like to
rage. She will hold her attack for when something

02:15:00.136 --> 02:15:01.962
comes within melee range.

02:15:01.962 --> 02:15:04.910
MATT: You've got it. Yasha finishes her go. Beau,
you're up.

02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:13.922
MARISHA: Okay, I go: Sorry, excuse me, Jes. Excuse
me, Fjord. Sorry. I hear there are rats? I wanted

02:15:13.922 --> 02:15:18.934
a pet rat once. My mom wouldn't let me have one.
Really sad. They're actually pretty clean--

02:15:18.934 --> 02:15:20.052
MATT: That's your turn.

02:15:21.712 --> 02:15:22.478
MARISHA: Yep.

02:15:23.688 --> 02:15:24.932
MATT: That's all you do?

02:15:24.932 --> 02:15:30.375
MARISHA: Maybe hold my action for an attack, but
yeah. I want to move forward past everybody and

02:15:30.375 --> 02:15:33.919
come up towards Caleb, but out of the way.

02:15:33.919 --> 02:15:35.174
MATT: There, maybe?

02:15:35.174 --> 02:15:36.390
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:43.934
MATT: Okay. You're talking and saying this as you
walk past, just as the oil flask, which has

02:15:43.934 --> 02:15:48.694
emptied now all over the rats, gets dropped and
shatters on the ground right next to it. That

02:15:48.694 --> 02:15:49.954
finishes your go, Beau?

02:15:49.954 --> 02:15:50.834
MARISHA: Yep.

02:15:51.174 --> 02:16:02.456
MATT: All righty. At the end of that turn, you
hear (snarling). Leaping from that ceiling portion

02:16:02.456 --> 02:16:10.493
down towards where Yasha is, you see a massive
beast entity. In some ways catlike and some ways

02:16:10.493 --> 02:16:17.064
doglike, it has large, bone-like spined
protrusions along the row of its back, between its

02:16:17.064 --> 02:16:23.704
shoulder blades. You can see patches of fur and
robust ribs that are pushing against very

02:16:23.704 --> 02:16:30.747
tightly-pulled skin. It looks like it's starved or
itself gaunt and skeletal in nature, but it is

02:16:30.747 --> 02:16:36.719
probably about ten feet from front to back. As it
leaps down towards her, it attempts to make a

02:16:36.719 --> 02:16:39.114
multiattack on Yasha.

02:16:41.444 --> 02:16:42.945
LAURA: Whoa, it's huge!

02:16:44.515 --> 02:16:47.638
MATT: First, you get your attack, as does Yasha.

02:16:49.548 --> 02:16:56.010
SAM: Oh, plus this for attack? 29 to hit.

02:16:56.010 --> 02:16:57.045
MATT: That hits.

02:16:57.045 --> 02:16:59.780
SAM: Am I hidden enough to get a sneak attack?

02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:03.297
MATT: It is adjacent to Yasha, so you don't have
to worry about it.

02:17:03.587 --> 02:17:04.767
TRAVIS: 25.

02:17:04.767 --> 02:17:06.242
MATT: That hits.

02:17:07.472 --> 02:17:14.068
TALIESIN: Holy fuck. Jesus.

02:17:16.498 --> 02:17:20.565
SAM: 34 to hit-- I mean, 34 points of damage.

02:17:20.565 --> 02:17:22.065
MATT: Ooh, nice!

02:17:22.934 --> 02:17:25.091
TRAVIS: 15 points of slashing damage.

02:17:25.091 --> 02:17:31.730
MATT: Slick! As it jumps down from the ceiling,
Yasha strikes with the Magician's Judge through

02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:36.553
the air, right as you release your bolt. You hear
(pained cry) as it rears slightly from the attack,

02:17:36.553 --> 02:17:40.936
but the momentum still comes clambering down
towards the ground and then up towards Yasha. At

02:17:40.936 --> 02:17:45.534
this point, you see that it has a tail. A long
tail. A hooked, curved tail.

02:17:45.534 --> 02:17:46.748
SAM: Scorpion tail?!

02:17:46.748 --> 02:17:53.721
MATT: It has a hooked barb at the end that's about
a foot long. First, it's going to strike with its

02:17:53.721 --> 02:17:57.561
bite attack against Yasha. That's going to be 19
to hit?

02:17:57.561 --> 02:18:02.026
TRAVIS: That hits. She's really got to do
something to her armor class, seriously.

02:18:02.966 --> 02:18:04.392
LIAM: What's her AC at?

02:18:04.392 --> 02:18:05.217
TRAVIS: 14.

02:18:05.217 --> 02:18:06.292
LIAM: That's low.

02:18:06.992 --> 02:18:11.778
SAM: Wait, no-- not 34 points. 31 points of
damage.

02:18:11.778 --> 02:18:25.217
MATT: Okay, got you. It's all good. That is 27
points of piercing damage to Yasha, reduced to 13.

02:18:26.447 --> 02:18:31.888
This tail stinger arcs in towards her to make a
strike as well. That's going to be another 19 to hit.

02:18:32.278 --> 02:18:33.414
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:18:34.514 --> 02:18:46.560
MATT: She takes 15 points of piercing damage,
reduced to seven, as the stinger at the end of the

02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:51.221
tail strikes and dives into right where the
clavicle and neck meet. It sinks in, and she pulls

02:18:51.221 --> 02:18:55.707
and yanks it out. She does need to make a
constitution saving throw, though, if you don't mind.

02:18:55.707 --> 02:18:57.895
TALIESIN: That she gets a d4 added to.

02:19:00.575 --> 02:19:02.487
MATT: Who is not blessed?

02:19:03.257 --> 02:19:05.020
LAURA: Only three people are blessed.

02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:07.357
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's only three blessed
right now.

02:19:07.357 --> 02:19:08.588
SAM: Fjord, Beau, Nott.

02:19:09.518 --> 02:19:14.965
TALIESIN: Oh, I thought it was Yasha, Beau, Nott.
Oh, never mind. She doesn't get that d4, then.

02:19:14.965 --> 02:19:15.813
TRAVIS: 17.

02:19:15.813 --> 02:19:16.985
MATT: Who is it?

02:19:16.985 --> 02:19:18.456
LAURA: It's Fjord, Beau, Nott.

02:19:18.766 --> 02:19:22.011
MATT: Fjord, Beau, Nott, so she does not get plus
d4 on that.

02:19:22.031 --> 02:19:23.367
TRAVIS: It was a one, so 17.

02:19:23.367 --> 02:19:34.075
MATT: 17, okay. That's fine. The stinger
withdraws. She pushes it out. She grasps

02:19:34.075 --> 02:19:37.373
the wound for a second. Doesn't seem to
have any effect.

02:19:39.833 --> 02:19:43.684
MARISHA: I was holding my attack. Can I do some
shurikens at it?

02:19:44.894 --> 02:19:48.240
MATT: Sure. That's true, you were holding your
attack for ranged, so go for it.

02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:52.812
MARISHA, TRAVIS, and LAURA: (shuriken noises)

02:19:52.812 --> 02:19:58.927
MARISHA: First attack. Natural 19, so 27?

02:19:59.527 --> 02:20:01.165
MATT: 27 does hit, yeah.

02:20:01.225 --> 02:20:10.667
MARISHA: Plus a d4. These are d4 damage, right?
Or are they monk weapons? We've gone back

02:20:10.667 --> 02:20:11.717
and forth about this--

02:20:11.717 --> 02:20:15.220
LIAM: I remember this. We've talked about
darts as shuriken.

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:22.979
MARISHA: I'll do a d4 for now. I don't know.
That's pretty good. That's three plus five, so

02:20:22.979 --> 02:20:29.141
that's eight damage for the first one. Do I get to
do two? I get to do two, right? Or do I just do one?

02:20:29.141 --> 02:20:33.389
MATT: By the rules, it's one, but we've been
house-ruling that you can take the full. That

02:20:33.389 --> 02:20:35.911
means that I can also use it against you guys as
well.

02:20:36.011 --> 02:20:46.762
MARISHA: That's another natural 19. I'll do the
d4. Seven damage.

02:20:46.762 --> 02:20:50.153
MATT: You got it. Okay, that finishes your go?

02:20:50.153 --> 02:20:51.019
MARISHA: Yep.

02:20:51.079 --> 02:20:57.927
MATT: All righty. That finishes that turn. Fjord,
you're up.

02:20:58.297 --> 02:21:01.814
TRAVIS: Yep, yep, yep. We haven't even done the
line of fire yet.

02:21:01.814 --> 02:21:03.804
SAM, TALIESIN and LIAM: Nope.

02:21:03.884 --> 02:21:06.106
TRAVIS: Sweet ass! All right.

02:21:07.346 --> 02:21:09.145
LAURA: Yee-haw!

02:21:10.525 --> 02:21:12.095
TALIESIN: It'll get old, I swear.

02:21:12.125 --> 02:21:13.512
SAM: Rootin'-tootin'!

02:21:14.742 --> 02:21:17.236
MARISHA: Happier than a jackass eating cactus!

02:21:17.236 --> 02:21:26.380
TRAVIS: I'm going to move in and get in front of
Caleb, down on that ledge. I will stay there. With

02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:34.596
my bonus action, I will cast Hexblade's Curse on
whatever the fuck that thing is.

02:21:35.866 --> 02:21:40.439
TALIESIN: It's a puppy-kitty. Half puppy, half
kitty.

02:21:40.439 --> 02:21:43.925
TRAVIS: I will hold my attack action if it comes
within melee range.

02:21:44.205 --> 02:21:59.653
MATT: You got it. That ends your turn. That brings
us now to the rats. This one (counting) can get

02:21:59.653 --> 02:22:05.773
right in between. It can move into people's
spaces--

02:22:05.773 --> 02:22:06.730
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:13.387
MATT: That doesn't make a huge difference, as a
swarm. Also, another rat swarm comes out of the

02:22:13.387 --> 02:22:21.990
corner here. Comes around and occupies Yasha's
space. It's going to make a round of bite attacks

02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:26.021
against you, Beau. That's going to be a
16 to hit.

02:22:26.021 --> 02:22:26.835
MARISHA: Miss.

02:22:26.835 --> 02:22:30.079
MATT: The rats begin to swarm around you, and you
kick and beat them.

02:22:30.079 --> 02:22:31.289
MARISHA: I say: No, no!

02:22:31.289 --> 02:22:37.615
MATT: Attacking Yasha, that is 14 to hit? That
just succeeds, so Yasha then takes-- as the rats

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:42.181
begin to climb up and bite around her legs and
knees. Some of them jump up towards her, and she's

02:22:42.181 --> 02:22:46.748
trying to whack them away with her hand as she's
focusing on the creature ahead of her. She takes

02:22:46.748 --> 02:22:48.209
nine points of piercing damage.

02:22:48.209 --> 02:22:49.243
TRAVIS: Five total?

02:22:49.243 --> 02:22:53.658
MATT: Yes, or four total. That finishes their go.
Caduceus, you're up.

02:22:53.928 --> 02:23:01.934
TALIESIN: Man. No, I'm after you. I'm six, so
Caleb is first.

02:23:01.934 --> 02:23:05.999
MATT: He's five. Right, Caleb? You rolled a five
for your initiative?

02:23:05.999 --> 02:23:12.229
TALIESIN: Oh, so I am first. It's going to be
interesting. Can I get within 30 feet of the big fella?

02:23:13.119 --> 02:23:14.290
MATT: Probably, yeah.

02:23:14.290 --> 02:23:18.272
TALIESIN: You can't cast Bane on a rat swarm, can
you? That seems--

02:23:18.272 --> 02:23:19.315
MATT: It's a creature.

02:23:19.315 --> 02:23:21.169
TALIESIN: Is it technically a creature?

02:23:21.169 --> 02:23:22.735
MATT: It is a swarm, technically.

02:23:22.735 --> 02:23:27.203
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bane on as many things
in this room as I can cast Bane on, which is

02:23:27.203 --> 02:23:35.448
technically three, as long as they're within 30
feet. It's a charisma save, so you've got a shot.

02:23:37.458 --> 02:23:39.352
MATT: Six for the rats on this end.

02:23:39.352 --> 02:23:40.818
TALIESIN: Close, but no cigar.

02:23:40.818 --> 02:23:43.417
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like it when you talk shit to
the rats.

02:23:43.417 --> 02:23:44.573
MATT: That is 14.

02:23:44.573 --> 02:23:45.629
TALIESIN: Still no.

02:23:45.629 --> 02:23:48.485
MATT: Rolled a natural 18, but they're minus four
charisma.

02:23:48.485 --> 02:23:49.925
TALIESIN: And the big fella.

02:23:49.925 --> 02:23:50.726
MATT: 16.

02:23:51.196 --> 02:23:53.001
TALIESIN: It's a charisma save of 16?

02:23:53.001 --> 02:23:55.103
MATT: Correct. Natural 17 minus one.

02:23:55.103 --> 02:23:56.770
TALIESIN: Did he save, or did he--?

02:23:56.770 --> 02:23:58.720
MATT: Is your DC 16? Then he saved, yeah.

02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.003
TALIESIN: Ah, motherfucker.

02:24:00.003 --> 02:24:00.715
MATT: Sorry.

02:24:00.715 --> 02:24:13.951
TALIESIN: That's okay. I'm going to use my bonus
action to cast-- I'm so sorry. Reaction.

02:24:13.951 --> 02:24:21.188
There we are. Cast Healing Word on Yasha really
quickly. I can do that, right? Yeah, 60 feet.

02:24:21.188 --> 02:24:24.708
MATT: Well, you cast Bane, so you cannot do
Healing Word in the same round.

02:24:24.708 --> 02:24:29.178
TALIESIN: Oh, I can't do Healing Word in the same
round? Okay, thank you. I can never remember.

02:24:29.178 --> 02:24:31.369
MATT: It's okay. It's one spell and a cantrip.

02:24:31.369 --> 02:24:37.229
TALIESIN: Then I will use my other one to release
the swarm of angry beetles.

02:24:37.229 --> 02:24:39.147
MATT: Swarm-on-swarm violence!

02:24:39.147 --> 02:24:42.801
TALIESIN: I'm going to put the beetles on the
creature who's being a jerk.

02:24:42.801 --> 02:24:45.613
MATT: Sure. Whereabouts? 30 feet, you can do it
right there.

02:24:45.613 --> 02:24:49.800
TALIESIN: On him. He's going to be in the middle
of it, and they're going to take a bite.

02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:50.660
MATT: Go for it.

02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:56.173
TALIESIN: Where are we? Here is my blightstaff,
and I have to go to creatures so I can figure out

02:24:56.173 --> 02:25:03.588
how to do this. That's an attack-- there's my
bite. That's a 15?

02:25:04.338 --> 02:25:06.366
MATT: 15, that hits.

02:25:06.366 --> 02:25:11.222
TALIESIN: That hits it? Oh wow, that's so nice.
Let's get a few d4s here.

02:25:11.222 --> 02:25:16.450
TRAVIS: I don't trust Matt right now. 15 hits the
thing?

02:25:16.690 --> 02:25:19.952
MATT: Yeah. Not everything has huge armor classes,
Travis.

02:25:20.362 --> 02:25:24.452
TRAVIS: Don't even talk to me. Mm-mm. That's a
deep-ass cave. This ain't done.

02:25:24.522 --> 02:25:28.877
TALIESIN: That's terrible. Three, five-- that's
seven points of damage.

02:25:29.077 --> 02:25:30.886
MATT: Seven points of damage? All right.

02:25:31.326 --> 02:25:32.557
TALIESIN: He's irritated.

02:25:32.557 --> 02:25:37.236
MATT: He is. The beetles are climbing and biting
in various parts of-- the patchy hair and fur

02:25:37.236 --> 02:25:42.822
across its body already has exposed bits of dull
gray and liver-spotted exposed portions that the

02:25:42.822 --> 02:25:47.457
beetles are all climbing onto, and clinging,
and carving bits out. It shakes them off best it can.

02:25:47.457 --> 02:25:49.168
TRAVIS: How much did you heal Yasha?

02:25:49.168 --> 02:25:51.406
TALIESIN: I couldn't. That was why I didn't say.

02:25:51.406 --> 02:25:53.358
TRAVIS: Yasha looks at you, disappointed.

02:25:53.358 --> 02:25:54.358
MATT: That your turn?

02:25:54.358 --> 02:25:56.360
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the end of my turn.

02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:57.136
MATT: Caleb.

02:25:57.136 --> 02:26:01.561
LIAM: Six seconds ago, it was just Caleb and Nott
standing on that little ledge, and Caleb was

02:26:01.561 --> 02:26:06.419
starting to swirl a little bit of fire in his
hand. Then fucking pandemonium broke out, so Caleb

02:26:06.419 --> 02:26:11.034
just watched and went: Oh, oh, oh. The ball goes
(flame sputtering) from his hand and hits the oil

02:26:11.034 --> 02:26:11.968
on the ground.

02:26:12.048 --> 02:26:19.628
MATT: (fire roaring) That's going to be against
the-- yeah, the oil on the ground. Those rats,

02:26:19.628 --> 02:26:24.525
those rats, the guy, and the beetles all suffer
the flame explosion as it burns across. It's a

02:26:24.525 --> 02:26:32.043
dexterity saving throw for each of them. For the
rats-- strangely, yeah! They made a 15, so they

02:26:32.043 --> 02:26:33.763
manage to only take--

02:26:33.763 --> 02:26:36.797
TALIESIN: Wait, they take a d4 negative to that.

02:26:37.477 --> 02:26:44.740
MATT: That's true. That'll do it. 11, they fail.
That is five points of fire damage to that rat

02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:52.758
swarm. The other one-- no, they fail. That is
another five points of fire damage to that rat

02:26:52.758 --> 02:26:54.341
swarm. The beetles--

02:26:54.341 --> 02:26:55.128
TALIESIN: Seven.

02:26:55.128 --> 02:27:01.085
MATT: Seven? They take five points of fire damage.
The creature, natural 19 plus one, 20. It makes

02:27:01.085 --> 02:27:02.836
the save, so it takes no damage.

02:27:02.836 --> 02:27:09.494
LIAM: I will finish this turn-- Caleb backs out of
the room going: Oh, oh, oh. Walks back and stands

02:27:09.494 --> 02:27:10.672
next to Jester.

02:27:11.392 --> 02:27:12.307
LAURA: Hi!

02:27:12.797 --> 02:27:14.279
LIAM: Oh, we look alike.

02:27:16.079 --> 02:27:21.585
MATT: All righty. That finishes your turn. Jester,
you're up first.

02:27:21.585 --> 02:27:25.590
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon!

02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:27.543
MATT: Where you putting it?

02:27:27.793 --> 02:27:32.215
LAURA: At fucking 4th-level.

02:27:32.215 --> 02:27:33.937
MATT: 4th-level, nice!

02:27:33.967 --> 02:27:45.046
LAURA: I'm going to put it right above the dude. That's
my bonus action, so I'm going to try to hit it. 14?

02:27:45.046 --> 02:27:47.362
MATT: Just misses.

02:27:47.362 --> 02:27:57.204
LAURA: Balls, yay. I'm going to cast Toll the Dead
as my action at the guy.

02:27:57.754 --> 02:27:59.230
MATT: It's a wisdom save?

02:27:59.230 --> 02:27:59.933
LAURA: Yes.

02:28:00.573 --> 02:28:01.971
MATT: Natural 20.

02:28:02.711 --> 02:28:05.160
LAURA: Cool. That was a really fun turn.

02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:06.221
MATT: Sorry.

02:28:06.361 --> 02:28:07.617
TALIESIN: Some days, man.

02:28:07.617 --> 02:28:10.135
TRAVIS: But you got your candy out there
on the field.

02:28:10.135 --> 02:28:13.439
LIAM: (deep voice) This is Sam Elliott for the
church of the Traveler.

02:28:13.999 --> 02:28:18.076
MATT: End of Jester's turn. Nott, you're up--
unless you want to move? You're good?

02:28:18.196 --> 02:28:19.145
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:28:19.145 --> 02:28:27.026
SAM: I'm going to get up and run deeper into the cave
right past the thing, using bonus action to disengage.

02:28:27.026 --> 02:28:29.809
MARISHA and LAURA: Ooh!

02:28:29.809 --> 02:28:32.879
MATT: (counting) 25, 30, 35. That's as far as you
can get there.

02:28:32.879 --> 02:28:37.127
SAM: Okay. I'll turn around. Well, do I see
anything back there?

02:28:37.127 --> 02:28:38.561
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:28:38.561 --> 02:28:45.116
SAM: Okay. Nope, seven. When I get there, I'll turn
around and fire a crossbow bolt into the big thing.

02:28:45.116 --> 02:28:46.912
MATT: You got it. Roll for attack.

02:28:46.912 --> 02:28:50.367
SAM: Oh yeah, plus things. That's 29 again.

02:28:50.367 --> 02:28:52.556
MATT: 29 again hits, yeah! Roll damage.

02:28:52.556 --> 02:28:54.893
SAM: Still sneak attack because it's engaged to--

02:28:54.893 --> 02:28:56.708
MATT: Because it's engaged with Yasha.

02:28:56.708 --> 02:28:58.303
SAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Whoa!

02:28:58.303 --> 02:29:03.180
MATT: Oh no! Six, six, five, five, one.

02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:05.687
SAM: 29.

02:29:07.187 --> 02:29:09.029
LIAM: One low roll, the rest are high.

02:29:09.029 --> 02:29:11.694
TALIESIN: It's like the thing splintered in it,
oh god.

02:29:11.694 --> 02:29:16.114
MATT: As it's currently being assaulted by a
cluster of beetles biting into its side, flames

02:29:16.114 --> 02:29:22.836
burst from underneath it. Yasha and it are both
clashing with jaw and blade. (yowl) In its

02:29:22.836 --> 02:29:30.288
hindquarters, the bolt slips in there. You watch
the tail suddenly, instinctively pulse and

02:29:30.288 --> 02:29:33.886
reflexively tense itself from the pain that it's
now suffering from the impact.

02:29:33.886 --> 02:29:36.982
SAM: I'll add a Fury of the Small, another eight
points of damage.

02:29:36.982 --> 02:29:45.749
MATT: Sure! 37 points of damage on one hit. Not
too bad. That's your turn. Yasha's go.

02:29:46.599 --> 02:29:53.003
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to stay in the melee range
of the creature and is going to try and work her

02:29:53.003 --> 02:29:58.191
way around and grapple the stinger on the tail.

02:29:58.201 --> 02:30:04.430
MATT: Okay! She can move around this way, if she
wants to go through the difficult terrain.

02:30:04.430 --> 02:30:14.414
(counting) 40. She'll get right there to try and
grapple its tail. The rats do get an attack of

02:30:14.414 --> 02:30:26.136
opportunity on her. No, not with the minus four
from the Bane. She moves around. Make an athletics

02:30:26.136 --> 02:30:29.348
check for her. Because she's raging, she does have
advantage on it.

02:30:33.028 --> 02:30:34.724
TRAVIS: That is 17.

02:30:35.534 --> 02:30:42.063
MATT: She manages to grapple the creature, and
she's holding the tail. It's grappled. It can't

02:30:42.063 --> 02:30:47.046
move. It can still strike with it. If she wants
to, next round, she can attempt to continue to

02:30:47.046 --> 02:30:52.930
actually restrain the tail and prevent it from
attacking. It is grappled, and if she wants to,

02:30:52.930 --> 02:30:57.843
next turn, she could hold it and make it unable to
do anything. Got it. It does get an attack this

02:30:57.843 --> 02:30:59.751
turn, but I'll say it's at disadvantage.

02:30:59.751 --> 02:31:02.508
TRAVIS: Does the grapple count towards keeping her
rage up?

02:31:02.508 --> 02:31:04.076
MATT: Yeah. It's still an attack.

02:31:04.076 --> 02:31:05.027
TRAVIS: Great. Okay.

02:31:05.027 --> 02:31:07.356
MATT: That finishes Yasha's turn. Beau, you're
up.

02:31:07.356 --> 02:31:16.597
MARISHA: I'm going to dart across, parkour off of
the stalagmite because I'm a boss. Nope, in front

02:31:16.597 --> 02:31:19.211
of the catdog's face.

02:31:19.481 --> 02:31:20.679
SAM: Where I was hiding.

02:31:20.939 --> 02:31:25.651
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to jump, and I'm going to
come down, and I'm going to rocket punch it with

02:31:25.651 --> 02:31:27.248
my staff to its throat.

02:31:27.248 --> 02:31:31.689
MATT: Right there? You got it. The rats already
used their reaction, so it doesn't matter.

02:31:32.379 --> 02:31:33.848
MARISHA: Do I get advantage?

02:31:35.238 --> 02:31:37.247
MATT: No, you don't get advantage on it.

02:31:37.247 --> 02:31:46.906
MARISHA: Okay. That's a 19 again. That keeps
happening, and I'm super into it. Oh god, and I

02:31:46.906 --> 02:31:49.427
rolled max damage! 13.

02:31:50.217 --> 02:31:51.532
MATT: 13? Ooh.

02:31:52.252 --> 02:31:53.480
MARISHA: Second attack--

02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:57.853
MATT: As you come down, <i>whack</i> with the staff
over the top of its head, (scream). It whips off

02:31:57.853 --> 02:32:02.303
to the side. Slobber scatters across the rock
floor, and it has to catch itself. It's starting

02:32:02.303 --> 02:32:03.231
to look woozy.

02:32:03.231 --> 02:32:07.201
MARISHA: I want to bring the staff back up and
reverse, with 20 to hit.

02:32:07.201 --> 02:32:08.588
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:32:09.408 --> 02:32:11.462
MARISHA: Yeah. Ten damage. Crack.

02:32:11.462 --> 02:32:14.940
MATT: Crack. Ooh, it's looking real bad.

02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:20.515
MARISHA: Then I'm going to turn to Yasha, and I'm
going to say, "You chasing tail?" Then I'm going

02:32:20.515 --> 02:32:23.225
to do a Flurry of Blows, and I'm going to go
<i>pop, pop.</i>

02:32:23.225 --> 02:32:25.876
MATT: I want to give you disadvantage for those
attacks.

02:32:26.716 --> 02:32:29.984
SAM: Does her tiefling dick grow back when she
says that?

02:32:30.924 --> 02:32:34.542
TRAVIS: It's like in Disney in The Little Mermaid.
There's this little, boop!

02:32:35.552 --> 02:32:40.506
MARISHA: It's subliminal. Yeah. First attack,
natural one.

02:32:40.996 --> 02:32:47.358
MATT: You're so involved in your shitty phrase to
Yasha that you look back and go, whoa!

02:32:47.478 --> 02:32:53.049
MARISHA: I meant to do that. Next one, that's
better.

02:32:53.049 --> 02:32:54.498
TALIESIN: Still have your d4.

02:32:54.498 --> 02:32:59.321
MARISHA: That was a natural one. Yeah, still a d4,
so that's 21 plus--

02:32:59.321 --> 02:33:00.199
MATT: That hits.

02:33:00.199 --> 02:33:05.743
MARISHA: Okay, 24. Ten damage again.

02:33:05.743 --> 02:33:10.523
MATT: Ten damage. You missed with that one strike,
and you turn back. It turns its giant jaws towards

02:33:10.523 --> 02:33:15.336
you, its mouth open, the strings of slobber
stretching from across its teeth. As it rears

02:33:15.336 --> 02:33:21.605
back, Yasha holding its tail, you uppercut it
right in the chin. You hear (whimpering), and it

02:33:21.605 --> 02:33:23.229
falls unconscious on the ground.

02:33:23.379 --> 02:33:27.872
SAM: Unconscious, not dead. We could still wake it
up and tame it.

02:33:27.922 --> 02:33:28.885
TRAVIS: Impressive.

02:33:30.385 --> 02:33:32.196
SAM: Should we wake it up and tame it?

02:33:32.196 --> 02:33:34.082
TALIESIN: There might be more in here. Let's--

02:33:34.082 --> 02:33:36.535
MATT: Hexblade's Curse is unfortunately gone.

02:33:36.535 --> 02:33:37.515
TRAVIS: The what?

02:33:37.515 --> 02:33:38.875
MATT: Hexblade's Curse is gone.

02:33:38.875 --> 02:33:39.793
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

02:33:39.793 --> 02:33:42.378
MATT: You gain temporary hit points from that, I
think?

02:33:42.378 --> 02:33:45.138
TRAVIS: I do. Yeah, that's okay. I haven't been
hit at all.

02:33:45.348 --> 02:33:47.546
MATT: That ends Beau's turn?

02:33:47.546 --> 02:33:48.522
MARISHA: Yep.

02:33:49.622 --> 02:33:51.870
TALIESIN: Now the dragon's turn. Sorry!

02:33:51.890 --> 02:33:58.119
MATT: You watch it collapse, and there is this,
"Oh cool, we can maybe tame this thing," Nott, you

02:33:58.119 --> 02:34:07.203
hear (growling). You look up above, and on an
upper platform, up here, as well as around the

02:34:07.203 --> 02:34:16.147
corner, are two more of the same creature looking
right at you. As they both run in and-- leaping

02:34:16.147 --> 02:34:26.637
down, there and there. First one is going to make
two attacks at you, one with a bite and one with

02:34:26.637 --> 02:34:30.253
its tail stinger. That is going to be a 19 to hit.

02:34:30.753 --> 02:34:31.787
SAM: Hits!

02:34:31.937 --> 02:34:35.097
MATT: You take--

02:34:35.097 --> 02:34:39.902
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh no!

02:34:39.932 --> 02:34:42.014
TRAVIS: Nice narrow cavern, too.

02:34:43.364 --> 02:34:45.344
MATT: 22 points of piercing damage.

02:34:45.714 --> 02:34:48.375
SAM: Okay, I guess I'll Uncanny Dodge that one.

02:34:48.375 --> 02:34:52.707
MATT: You take 11 points of piercing damage. You
can mark that. The tail stinger is going to

02:34:52.707 --> 02:34:55.969
attempt to strike at you. That is going to be a 22
to hit.

02:34:55.969 --> 02:34:56.727
SAM: Hits.

02:34:57.127 --> 02:35:03.636
MATT: You then immediately suffer 14 points of
piercing damage. I need you to make a constitution

02:35:03.636 --> 02:35:04.387
saving throw.

02:35:04.387 --> 02:35:05.368
TALIESIN: With a d4.

02:35:05.368 --> 02:35:06.220
MATT: Correct.

02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:14.988
SAM: Not great. Better, better. 15.

02:35:14.988 --> 02:35:16.718
MATT: You succeed the saving throw.

02:35:16.718 --> 02:35:18.152
SAM: Thank you!

02:35:18.152 --> 02:35:23.158
MATT: As you feel the toxin pushing into your
body, you manage to wrench it from the front of

02:35:23.158 --> 02:35:30.607
your chest and sternum. Some of the weird, oily,
poison venom (spurting) out the back of it, as you

02:35:30.607 --> 02:35:35.271
remove it from the wound. As you push it away, the
other one comes in to bite you from the opposite

02:35:35.271 --> 02:35:38.168
end. That's going to be a 15 to hit?

02:35:38.338 --> 02:35:39.174
SAM: No!

02:35:39.244 --> 02:35:44.788
MATT: That you duck below, and its bite hits the
side of the rock wall. Tail stinger is going to

02:35:44.788 --> 02:35:46.720
come at you. That is a natural 20.

02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:50.079
TALIESIN: You're more that 30 feet away, aren't
you?

02:35:50.079 --> 02:35:51.095
MATT: From you, yes.

02:35:51.095 --> 02:35:53.389
TALIESIN: Yep, never mind. I can't do anything.

02:35:53.389 --> 02:36:02.946
MATT: You suffer 30 points of piercing damage from
the tail as the stinger hits you in the abdomen

02:36:02.946 --> 02:36:07.468
and lifts you like a foot off the ground. You're
actually held there for a second. Make another

02:36:07.468 --> 02:36:08.733
constitution saving throw.

02:36:09.203 --> 02:36:11.731
SAM: That's a natural one.

02:36:13.451 --> 02:36:16.588
MATT: You are poisoned, and you are paralyzed.

02:36:18.408 --> 02:36:26.458
TRAVIS: Oh crap! Okay. Where the fuck are you?

02:36:27.968 --> 02:36:29.275
LAURA: This is really bad.

02:36:29.275 --> 02:36:32.085
TALIESIN: Well, it's bad. It's not really bad, but
it's bad.

02:36:32.085 --> 02:36:34.676
SAM: I'm not dead, just paralyzed and poisoned.

02:36:34.676 --> 02:36:36.427
LAURA: They both have gone now?

02:36:36.427 --> 02:36:42.962
MATT: They both attacked, and they are going to
back away now. It's going to drag you this way in

02:36:42.962 --> 02:36:50.750
the corner, in its jaw. It's pulling you off of
the stinger of the other, and it pulls you away.

02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:53.720
Nott's-- you're still conscious, right?

02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:54.628
SAM: Yeah.

02:36:54.988 --> 02:37:00.935
MATT: Eyes open, dragging on the ground, hands and
crossbow being pulled across the stone. That ends

02:37:00.935 --> 02:37:03.846
their turn. That now brings us to Fjord.

02:37:04.416 --> 02:37:15.749
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to bring myself within 30
feet of where Nott is. I guess I'll come forward

02:37:15.749 --> 02:37:17.041
as much as I need to.

02:37:17.741 --> 02:37:20.762
MATT: (counting) 30.

02:37:20.762 --> 02:37:22.691
TRAVIS: No, 30 feet away from Nott.

02:37:22.691 --> 02:37:24.148
MATT: Oh, 30 feet away. I see.

02:37:24.148 --> 02:37:29.514
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to use my bonus action with
the Summer's Dance falchion to Misty Step to Nott.

02:37:31.064 --> 02:37:35.504
MATT: You then suddenly appear partway across the
chamber, right next to Nott.

02:37:35.674 --> 02:37:40.317
TRAVIS: I'm going to reach out and grab her and
go: Bad doggy! I'm going to cast Thunder Step.

02:37:41.027 --> 02:37:42.953
I'm going to bring Nott with me.

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.886
MATT: Okay! What's the saving throw on
Thunder Step?

02:37:47.226 --> 02:37:50.062
TRAVIS: It is a constitution, 16.

02:37:52.222 --> 02:37:56.334
MATT: Ten plus six, 16. It just makes it. It still
takes half damage, right?

02:37:56.334 --> 02:37:57.181
TRAVIS: It does.

02:37:57.181 --> 02:37:58.413
MATT: Roll damage on that.

02:37:58.413 --> 02:38:12.739
TRAVIS: Okay, that's 4d10 now. 12, 22, 28. Yeah,
28.

02:38:12.739 --> 02:38:20.639
MATT: 14 points of thunder damage to it as you
appear, grab Nott, and then this quaking impact,

02:38:20.639 --> 02:38:26.261
this blast, shakes the interior of the chamber.
Pieces of loose stone and rock tumble from the

02:38:26.261 --> 02:38:32.127
ground as a whole layer of dust is shaken loose
from the roof of this cavern, slowly drifting down

02:38:32.127 --> 02:38:39.539
as other pebbles fall. You see as Fjord reaches
out and grabs you, and you both vanish. Where do

02:38:39.539 --> 02:38:40.645
you want to be placed?

02:38:40.645 --> 02:38:44.698
TRAVIS: We're going to shoot back up to where
Caduceus is. I'm going to drop Nott off.

02:38:44.698 --> 02:38:50.300
SAM: What a move! Greens stick together.

02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:53.172
TRAVIS: Yeah. Drowning victims.

02:38:54.512 --> 02:38:58.416
MATT: Yeah. Does that finish your turn?

02:38:58.416 --> 02:39:00.679
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:39:00.679 --> 02:39:08.787
MATT: That ends Fjord's go. Now it's the rats'
turn. Now, these rats are going to move up to

02:39:08.787 --> 02:39:15.758
Caduceus, there. This one's going to also move up
to your area there, Caduceus. You now have these

02:39:15.758 --> 02:39:20.541
two rat swarms. They start clawing up the side of
the rocks and swarming up towards you. Around the

02:39:20.541 --> 02:39:23.608
left side, you see the other swarm spin up in
your direction.

02:39:23.608 --> 02:39:24.733
TALIESIN: That's fine.

02:39:24.963 --> 02:39:33.100
MATT: First one is going to-- I'm going to roll
the d4, since they have Bane on them. That is a 12.

02:39:33.100 --> 02:39:34.450
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

02:39:34.450 --> 02:39:35.620
MATT: That does not hit.

02:39:38.338 --> 02:39:42.673
TALIESIN: That one I'm going to use Shield of
Retribution on, just because that's fun. Yeah,

02:39:42.673 --> 02:39:52.296
just to be a dick. They suffer-- here we go. That
second group of rats takes 4d6 force damage.

02:39:54.046 --> 02:40:03.654
That's 14 points of force damage, and they have to
make a strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet

02:40:03.654 --> 02:40:04.875
directly away from me.

02:40:04.875 --> 02:40:07.697
MATT: Three, they fail! Which one do you want to
cast it on?

02:40:07.927 --> 02:40:11.507
TALIESIN: The second one, whichever one is closest
to Nott.

02:40:11.717 --> 02:40:12.610
MATT: This one.

02:40:12.610 --> 02:40:13.992
TALIESIN: Yeah, 20 feet away.

02:40:13.992 --> 02:40:16.098
SAM: Some of you guys care about me so much.

02:40:16.098 --> 02:40:21.715
MATT:	As they climb up and start attacking,
Caduceus pulls the-- it's the shield, right? Slams

02:40:21.715 --> 02:40:27.999
a foot into the ground, and the shield suddenly
emits this vibrating, impacting wave of arcane or

02:40:27.999 --> 02:40:36.923
divine energy and forces outward. The rats scatter
back in this net of furry bodies that all pelt the

02:40:36.923 --> 02:40:42.062
ground about 20 feet away, not far from where
you're standing, Beau. They all gather in the

02:40:42.062 --> 02:40:47.698
center to form another swarm once more. The swarm
is actively thinned out. It's half the swarm it

02:40:47.698 --> 02:40:48.635
used to be.

02:40:50.195 --> 02:40:52.248
MARISHA: Still whole on the inside, though.

02:40:52.248 --> 02:40:54.189
MATT: There you go. Mostly.

02:40:54.189 --> 02:40:55.432
TALIESIN: Rat game.

02:40:55.692 --> 02:40:58.453
MATT: That's going to finish their go. Caduceus,
you're up.

02:40:58.453 --> 02:41:03.786
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- can I touch Nott at
this point?

02:41:03.786 --> 02:41:05.672
MATT: You can move over and touch Nott.

02:41:05.672 --> 02:41:07.957
TALIESIN: I'm going to move over and touch Nott.

02:41:07.957 --> 02:41:09.384
TRAVIS: How do you touch Nott?

02:41:09.384 --> 02:41:13.923
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently give a little
pat, and I'm going to cast Lesser Restoration.

02:41:14.958 --> 02:41:15.958
MATT: Which removes--

02:41:15.958 --> 02:41:25.353
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick paralyzed because
that'll be a beginning. Since that's a 2nd-level

02:41:25.353 --> 02:41:31.188
spell, as a bonus, can I cast something that's a
lower level? I can't remember how the dual--

02:41:31.188 --> 02:41:32.535
oh wait, no, I also have a--

02:41:32.535 --> 02:41:33.873
LAURA: Only a cantrip.

02:41:33.873 --> 02:41:38.076
TALIESIN: Only a cantrip? Not a bonus action, even
with--

02:41:38.076 --> 02:41:40.787
MATT: As it works, you can cast one spell per
round.

02:41:40.897 --> 02:41:43.466
LAURA: You can take a feat, though, to do that.

02:41:43.466 --> 02:41:44.873
TALIESIN: Which feat is that?

02:41:44.873 --> 02:41:46.007
LAURA: It's in Matt's--

02:41:46.007 --> 02:41:51.202
MATT: It's in the Tal'Dorei-- next time, yeah.
That's what you've got right now. You cast Lesser

02:41:51.202 --> 02:41:55.391
Restoration, and that's your turn, unless you have
a bonus action spell that's a cantrip.

02:41:55.391 --> 02:42:02.009
TALIESIN: For my bonus action, I'm going to move the
insect swarm to whatever's the closest thing to them.

02:42:02.009 --> 02:42:03.489
MATT: The rats you pushed back.

02:42:03.489 --> 02:42:05.581
TALIESIN: Then they're going to take a bite.

02:42:05.581 --> 02:42:08.486
MATT: Go for it. With that, you are no longer
paralyzed, Nott.

02:42:08.486 --> 02:42:09.890
SAM and LAURA: Hey!

02:42:09.890 --> 02:42:11.245
MATT: You're still poisoned.

02:42:11.245 --> 02:42:12.830
TALIESIN: That's terrible. Seven.

02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:25.756
SAM: As I whip out of my paralyzation, I look at
Caduceus, and I'm confused. Sunbreaker, is that you?

02:42:27.106 --> 02:42:29.414
TALIESIN: No one's ever called me that before.

02:42:29.644 --> 02:42:31.558
MATT: As you're having this discussion--

02:42:31.558 --> 02:42:33.800
TRAVIS: Hey, it's okay, I only saved your life.

02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:35.689
SAM: He looks like a minotaur.

02:42:36.279 --> 02:42:42.279
MATT: You hear the screaming of dozens of rats as
beetles feast upon their corpses. Swarm-on-swarm

02:42:42.279 --> 02:42:44.595
violence ends with the death of that rat swarm.

02:42:44.595 --> 02:42:46.542
LAURA: (laughs) Swarm-on-swarm violence.

02:42:46.542 --> 02:42:49.778
MATT: There we go. That finishes your go,
Caduceus? Caleb, you're up.

02:42:49.778 --> 02:42:54.906
LIAM: I will take a straight walk forward, and
plant myself next to Caduceus, and look past

02:42:54.906 --> 02:43:00.699
Beauregard and Yasha. Smearing molasses on my
hands, I go and I turn my hand in a

02:43:00.699 --> 02:43:05.530
counterclockwise circle and cast Slow, 120 feet
away on these two beasts.

02:43:05.530 --> 02:43:07.663
MATT: On these two beasts there? You got it.

02:43:07.663 --> 02:43:08.589
LIAM: Wisdom, 16.

02:43:11.029 --> 02:43:17.105
MATT: The one on that end there, natural 14 plus
five, 19. The one around the corner--

02:43:17.705 --> 02:43:18.853
MARISHA: Plus five.

02:43:18.853 --> 02:43:21.901
MATT: Yeah, they have a plus-five wisdom save. Ten
plus five, 15.

02:43:21.901 --> 02:43:23.348
LIAM: Oh, so that one fails.

02:43:23.418 --> 02:43:25.060
MATT: That one is slowed.

02:43:25.890 --> 02:43:27.510
LAURA: They're really intelligent.

02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:30.068
MATT: Your spell DC's 16? Yeah, so that one is
slowed.

02:43:30.068 --> 02:43:32.409
MARISHA: Maybe we <i>can</i> tame the unconscious one.

02:43:32.409 --> 02:43:33.737
SAM: Or all of them.

02:43:36.227 --> 02:43:39.764
MATT: Slow is, they can only take attack--

02:43:39.764 --> 02:43:46.384
LIAM: Action or bonus action, not both. AC is
reduced, and movement is--

02:43:46.384 --> 02:43:47.380
MATT: Halved.

02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:54.214
LIAM: I'll get back to you on that.

02:43:54.214 --> 02:43:58.400
MATT: That's fine. Okay, well, there you go. You
cast your Slow spell. Is that your turn?

02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:02.597
LIAM: Speed is halved, takes negative two to its
AC and dex saves. Yeah, that is my turn.

02:44:02.597 --> 02:44:06.064
MATT: Okay, cool. Ending that go, top of the
round, Jester, you're up.

02:44:06.064 --> 02:44:12.435
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to step in the doorway, and
I'm going to point to the back like I'm about to

02:44:12.435 --> 02:44:15.541
swing a baseball bat.

02:44:15.541 --> 02:44:16.543
TRAVIS: A home run?

02:44:16.543 --> 02:44:22.058
LAURA: Yeah, a home run. I'm going to do this and
make my Spiritual Weapon fly up and batter swing

02:44:22.808 --> 02:44:23.704
the bad guy.

02:44:23.704 --> 02:44:27.028
MATT: Right there? Go for it. That's amazing.

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:30.306
LAURA: Motherfuck you!

02:44:30.626 --> 02:44:32.083
TALIESIN: That was so rough.

02:44:32.083 --> 02:44:34.707
MATT: I saw that dice spin around and do a little
dance.

02:44:34.707 --> 02:44:37.384
TALIESIN: It thought about things. It really
deliberated.

02:44:37.384 --> 02:44:39.246
SAM: There's no crying in baseball.

02:44:40.846 --> 02:44:43.570
LAURA: That's 11. That does not hit.

02:44:43.570 --> 02:44:49.228
MATT: 11 does not hit, unfortunately. It swings
wide and hits the rock. Part of the stone wall,

02:44:49.228 --> 02:44:53.192
next to the beast as it pulls away, breaks, and a
section of stone (clattering).

02:44:53.192 --> 02:44:57.333
LAURA: Fuck you! Know what I should've done?
I should've done this in the reverse order!

02:44:57.333 --> 02:45:01.602
Whatever, I'm helping someone else out. I'm going
to Guiding Bolt that beast next.

02:45:01.602 --> 02:45:06.975
MATT: The same one? Go for it! Roll for an attack
on Guiding Bolt as you <i>hadouken</i> a giant,

02:45:06.975 --> 02:45:10.357
glowing, divine bolt of energy.

02:45:11.077 --> 02:45:12.090
LAURA: 17?

02:45:12.090 --> 02:45:13.171
MATT: 17 hits.

02:45:13.201 --> 02:45:20.629
LAURA: Oh, I was casting that at 4th-level, P.S.,
because that's what I have up. I swear.

02:45:20.629 --> 02:45:22.010
TALIESIN: Yeah, that is true.

02:45:22.010 --> 02:45:24.758
MATT: Okay. That's your other 4th-level spell? You
got it.

02:45:24.758 --> 02:45:30.135
LAURA: Yes, because I'm smart. That's 7d6.

02:45:30.135 --> 02:45:34.199
TALIESIN: I'm concentrating on Bane, which is
almost gone anyways because there's only one more

02:45:34.199 --> 02:45:35.348
creature with it.

02:45:36.108 --> 02:45:53.064
LAURA: (counting) 27 points of radiant damage. The
next attack gets advantage; that's why I should've

02:45:53.064 --> 02:45:56.849
fucking done that first, and then I had
advantage on my--

02:45:56.849 --> 02:45:57.592
MATT: Yeah.

02:45:57.592 --> 02:45:59.369
TRAVIS: Nott is after Jester.

02:45:59.699 --> 02:46:01.210
LAURA and MARISHA: Yee-haw!

02:46:01.210 --> 02:46:02.457
TALIESIN: Dang-nabbit.

02:46:02.457 --> 02:46:04.928
MATT: That finishes your go, Jester. Nott, you're
up.

02:46:04.928 --> 02:46:08.209
SAM: At the top of my turn, do I take-- I'm still
poisoned, I believe?

02:46:08.209 --> 02:46:12.069
MATT: You're just poisoned, is the status. Meaning
your attacks have disadvantage.

02:46:12.069 --> 02:46:14.025
SAM: Oh, I don't take damage every round?

02:46:14.025 --> 02:46:16.214
MATT: It is not a consistent, damaging poison.

02:46:16.214 --> 02:46:17.908
SAM: Okay, attacks at disadvantage?

02:46:17.908 --> 02:46:19.736
MATT: Correct, while you are poisoned.

02:46:19.736 --> 02:46:24.506
TALIESIN: If you get advantage, you cancel it out.
If you get double advantage, you get advantage, if

02:46:24.506 --> 02:46:25.412
I recall correctly.

02:46:25.412 --> 02:46:29.745
MATT: Technically, if you have advantage and
disadvantage, as long as they cancel each other

02:46:29.745 --> 02:46:33.416
out, it doesn't matter how many more of one or the
other. It's a regular roll.

02:46:33.416 --> 02:46:34.137
TALIESIN: Fair.

02:46:34.137 --> 02:46:36.415
SAM: Is anything engaged with these beasts?

02:46:36.415 --> 02:46:37.165
MATT: No.

02:46:37.175 --> 02:46:40.883
SAM: They're at disadvantage because they're slow,
right? No.

02:46:41.123 --> 02:46:45.765
MATT: No. That guy's AC is a little bit lower.
That guy has advantage against him on the next

02:46:45.765 --> 02:46:48.127
attack because she hit it with Guiding Bolt.

02:46:48.627 --> 02:46:54.756
SAM: I'll go attack the one that has Guiding Bolt.
I have to run up closer to get within 30 feet.

02:46:54.756 --> 02:46:56.990
MATT: Okay. How close are you getting?

02:46:57.110 --> 02:47:04.329
SAM: Within 30 feet exactly, without running
into fire.

02:47:04.329 --> 02:47:07.744
MATT: Yeah. The fire, it's not enough to really
damage anybody after the initial flare-up.

02:47:09.684 --> 02:47:15.192
SAM: Caleb, should we do Fireline again? I got one
more flask.

02:47:15.932 --> 02:47:17.945
LIAM: Back to the drawing board.

02:47:17.985 --> 02:47:29.725
SAM: Then I will bonus action hide behind that
pillar. Shit, I could attack now, but it won't be

02:47:29.725 --> 02:47:32.726
sneak attack damage. Well, I'm bonus
action hiding.

02:47:32.726 --> 02:47:34.606
MATT: Make a stealth check.

02:47:34.606 --> 02:47:37.487
SAM: Okay. 18 plus things.

02:47:37.787 --> 02:47:38.900
LAURA: Plus 11.

02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:51.029
SAM: Plus 11. I'm going to attempt to hide and
then attack. Disadvantage, advantage, so it's a

02:47:51.029 --> 02:47:52.612
straight roll? Ten.

02:47:52.612 --> 02:47:57.436
TALIESIN: Would you still have a-- do you still
have Bless? Yeah, you haven't gone unconscious.

02:47:57.876 --> 02:48:03.289
SAM: 11, and the attack is plus nine.

02:48:03.319 --> 02:48:07.934
MATT: It does hit. However, it is not sneak attack
because, even though you were hiding, advantage

02:48:07.934 --> 02:48:11.085
and disadvantage cancels out. You're just doing a
regular bolt.

02:48:11.085 --> 02:48:17.955
SAM: A regular bolt. Mm, so sad. Eight points.

02:48:17.955 --> 02:48:23.433
MATT: Eight points of damage. That finishes your
go, Nott. Yasha's turn.

02:48:23.963 --> 02:48:30.255
TRAVIS: I'm going to be honest, I think D&amp;D Beyond
reset her hit points. I think she was at 55? I'm

02:48:30.255 --> 02:48:31.769
guessing from memory, so that's--

02:48:31.769 --> 02:48:35.176
MATT: You guys have had a few nights. You had a
long rest, remember?

02:48:35.176 --> 02:48:38.462
TRAVIS: Yeah, but she got hit a bunch in the cave.
I mean, reset her--

02:48:38.462 --> 02:48:39.915
MATT: Oh, earlier, you mean?

02:48:39.915 --> 02:48:44.589
TRAVIS: It just reset her. Yeah, so I don't know
if chat has it or whatever. Max can tell me, but I

02:48:44.589 --> 02:48:53.874
think she was at 55. She will run up and make both
of her attacks at, yeah.

02:48:53.874 --> 02:48:55.426
MATT: You got it.

02:48:56.366 --> 02:49:03.923
TRAVIS: Not reckless because thorny tails and
shit. That is a 22 to hit.

02:49:03.923 --> 02:49:04.888
MATT: 22 hits!

02:49:04.978 --> 02:49:10.275
TRAVIS: Brilliant, and that's 21 to hit.

02:49:10.365 --> 02:49:13.005
MATT: 21 to hit also hits. Both hit! Nice.

02:49:13.005 --> 02:49:29.783
TRAVIS: First one has the Divine Fury. Six!
Awesome. (counting) 22! 22 points of slashing

02:49:29.783 --> 02:49:36.626
damage. Second one, (counting) 14 points of slashing
damage.

02:49:36.626 --> 02:49:41.301
MATT: As she rushes forward, one giant swing with
her two-handed greatsword, Magician's Judge, cuts

02:49:41.301 --> 02:49:45.879
across the front of the head. (squeals) It backs
away, and you see a splatter of blood across the

02:49:45.879 --> 02:49:50.554
ground. She comes around for a second body strike.
It actually cuts through part of the shoulder of

02:49:50.554 --> 02:49:55.079
the creature. You see its arm fold a little to
that side before it catches itself, and the blade

02:49:55.079 --> 02:49:59.706
catches the stone. The actual weapon shakes from
the impact as she dislodges it. No damage. It's a

02:49:59.706 --> 02:50:05.071
magic weapon; it's fine, but it leaves a giant cleft
mark in the middle of the stone wall. That end her turn?

02:50:05.071 --> 02:50:06.007
TRAVIS: It does.

02:50:06.007 --> 02:50:08.890
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Beau.

02:50:09.150 --> 02:50:19.845
MARISHA: I sashay forward towards this guy. Might
as well finish what Yasha started and pop pop.

02:50:20.061 --> 02:50:21.283
MATT: Go for it.

02:50:21.503 --> 02:50:30.654
MARISHA: I'm going to use my staff. That's super
lame. That's 11.

02:50:31.014 --> 02:50:36.084
MATT: 11 does not hit. You try and swing and it's
jaws actually catch the edge of your staff and you

02:50:36.084 --> 02:50:39.066
have to wrench it free. It's growling at you.

02:50:39.066 --> 02:50:44.179
MARISHA: No fetch! Natural 20 on the next one.
What's up?

02:50:44.179 --> 02:50:45.899
MATT: That will definitely hit.

02:50:47.289 --> 02:50:52.754
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies. Oh my god. This
happens to me all the time. Every time, I feel

02:50:52.754 --> 02:50:55.934
like. I'm going to double my one to a two.

02:50:56.004 --> 02:50:58.553
MATT: I'm sorry. But hey, you hit!

02:51:00.583 --> 02:51:02.048
TRAVIS: Critical beep.

02:51:02.048 --> 02:51:03.852
MARISHA: Seven damage.

02:51:04.032 --> 02:51:07.514
MATT: All right. Seven damage on that strike. You
have your bonus action still.

02:51:07.514 --> 02:51:12.168
MARISHA: Super cool. I'm going to bonus action
Flurry of Blows.

02:51:12.168 --> 02:51:13.486
MATT: All righty.

02:51:14.516 --> 02:51:21.438
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. 14?

02:51:22.298 --> 02:51:26.206
MATT: All right, let's see here. 14 does not hit.

02:51:26.206 --> 02:51:27.836
MARISHA: Okay. Next one.

02:51:27.836 --> 02:51:30.023
MATT: 15 is the threshold, unfortunately.

02:51:30.593 --> 02:51:31.593
MARISHA: No.

02:51:32.743 --> 02:51:36.444
LAURA: Are you adding your d4? You're blessed.

02:51:36.444 --> 02:51:39.202
MARISHA: Fuck. So 14 plus--

02:51:39.202 --> 02:51:40.830
MATT: That hits.

02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:50.646
MARISHA: To 16? Okay. Thanks, Jes. That's better.
Ten damage. And the next one was an eight plus

02:51:50.646 --> 02:51:54.156
five, so 13 plus-- 15.

02:51:54.156 --> 02:51:55.841
LAURA: That's what you need.

02:51:55.841 --> 02:52:01.154
MARISHA: 15 hits? Eyy, Bless is the fucking best!
Eight damage.

02:52:01.254 --> 02:52:06.076
LAURA: Yeah. It's like even though I'm not
hitting, I'm letting other people hit.

02:52:06.076 --> 02:52:07.089
MARISHA: It's true.

02:52:07.089 --> 02:52:08.885
MATT: Do you want to learn anything about the
creature?

02:52:10.085 --> 02:52:11.202
MARISHA: Yes. What--

02:52:11.202 --> 02:52:12.773
SAM: What if we can tame it!

02:52:13.223 --> 02:52:17.648
MATT: Resistances, immunities, condition immunities, 
anything else you want to know about it?

02:52:17.648 --> 02:52:19.152
LIAM: Favorite chew toy?

02:52:20.892 --> 02:52:24.384
MATT: What type of creature it is, whatever. You
have two hits.

02:52:24.384 --> 02:52:27.961
MARISHA: What type of creature is it? Is it a
beast? Is it a creature?

02:52:27.961 --> 02:52:30.308
MATT: It is a fiend. A demon, specifically.

02:52:30.308 --> 02:52:32.730
MARISHA: It is a demon-specific fiend.

02:52:34.110 --> 02:52:36.527
LAURA: Oh my god, what if there's a portal in
here?

02:52:36.527 --> 02:52:41.672
MATT: As you punch into twice and you pull back,
you look at its wounds and there's this necrotic

02:52:41.672 --> 02:52:46.190
essence festering in it, and that's when you're
like, "This creature's not from this plane. This

02:52:46.190 --> 02:52:49.331
"is not natural." You can learn another thing from
it, if you want.

02:52:49.331 --> 02:52:54.064
MARISHA: Okay. It's made of planar essence. We
know his wisdom is plus five. Do we want to know

02:52:54.064 --> 02:52:55.601
any saving throws?

02:52:56.631 --> 02:52:57.920
LAURA: Weaknesses?

02:52:57.920 --> 02:53:00.488
MARISHA: Yeah, let's see if it has any
vulnerabilities.

02:53:00.488 --> 02:53:03.107
MATT: Vulnerabilities? No vulnerabilities on these
guys.

02:53:03.107 --> 02:53:03.978
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:53:03.978 --> 02:53:04.992
LAURA: Shit. Sorry.

02:53:04.992 --> 02:53:09.275
MATT: There's always damage resistances you can
learn. There's always condition immunities.

02:53:09.275 --> 02:53:11.511
MARISHA: Resistances? Okay.

02:53:11.511 --> 02:53:14.411
MATT: You did hit one earlier with a bonus action,
didn't you?

02:53:14.411 --> 02:53:15.625
MARISHA: I did.

02:53:15.625 --> 02:53:17.442
MATT: You got to remember to use that.

02:53:17.442 --> 02:53:18.217
MARISHA: I know.

02:53:18.217 --> 02:53:22.541
LIAM: It's all right. There are only three rules
in the game. They're very easy to remember.

02:53:22.541 --> 02:53:24.294
MATT: That finish your turn, Beau?

02:53:24.294 --> 02:53:25.052
MARISHA: Yep.

02:53:25.052 --> 02:53:30.786
MATT: All righty. It's now their turn. The one
that's slowed, half movement. It's going to bound

02:53:30.786 --> 02:53:36.715
up towards Yasha. It can only make one attack, so
it's going to swing out with its tail. Right? It

02:53:36.715 --> 02:53:37.705
says it can make--

02:53:37.705 --> 02:53:39.233
LIAM: Action or bonus. Not both.

02:53:39.233 --> 02:53:42.677
MATT: Oh, action or bonus? But multiattack can
only take one attack, correct?

02:53:42.677 --> 02:53:43.577
LIAM: Only one.

02:53:43.577 --> 02:53:46.004
MATT: So it's going to attack with its tail
stinger.

02:53:46.004 --> 02:53:46.984
LIAM: A single thing.

02:53:46.984 --> 02:53:49.226
MATT: All righty. That's going to be 16 to hit.

02:53:49.226 --> 02:53:50.000
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:53:50.540 --> 02:53:52.267
MATT: So Yasha takes--

02:53:52.267 --> 02:53:54.645
TALIESIN: We need to do something about Yasha's
AC.

02:53:54.645 --> 02:53:55.458
LAURA: Yeah.

02:53:57.148 --> 02:54:03.788
MATT: 17 points of piercing damage, reduced to
eight. Constitution saving throw.

02:54:03.788 --> 02:54:04.897
TALIESIN: With a d4.

02:54:04.897 --> 02:54:07.142
MATT: She does not get a d4. She's not blessed.

02:54:07.152 --> 02:54:09.487
TALIESIN: Oh, she's not blessed! My god,
my brain.

02:54:09.487 --> 02:54:11.539
TRAVIS: Not going to do it. That's a seven.

02:54:11.539 --> 02:54:13.489
MATT: She is poisoned and paralyzed.

02:54:13.489 --> 02:54:14.715
LAURA: No!

02:54:14.765 --> 02:54:15.967
SAM: Not P&amp;P!

02:54:20.207 --> 02:54:25.767
MATT: As the stinger jams into the side of her
neck, she reaches up to grab it and suddenly the

02:54:25.767 --> 02:54:31.549
muscles tense up and flex and as the stinger
withdraws from her throat, her eyes go wide and

02:54:31.549 --> 02:54:35.508
you can see a bit of foam gathering at the corner
of her mouth. Her hand is stuck in that position.

02:54:35.788 --> 02:54:40.023
The other one is going to go. It's going to make
both of its attacks on a paralyzed Yasha.

02:54:40.023 --> 02:54:43.937
LAURA: Oh no, she's paralyzed! That means it gets
critical! Is it an auto-critical?

02:54:44.177 --> 02:54:48.997
MATT: Yeah. So the first, the bite attack, is
going to be a critical hit automatically.

02:54:49.587 --> 02:54:52.161
LAURA: Oh my god, did you just kill Ashley's
character?

02:54:52.161 --> 02:54:54.179
SAM: Do you know how many hit points she has?

02:54:54.179 --> 02:54:55.001
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:54:55.001 --> 02:54:57.399
LAURA: You know now how many she has left?

02:54:57.399 --> 02:54:59.127
SAM: Did they text you or something?

02:54:59.697 --> 02:55:04.482
TRAVIS: I was guessing before, but I think I was
close. I might be off by one. I know where she's at.

02:55:04.482 --> 02:55:06.056
TALIESIN: Oh wow. How bad?

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:08.352
LIAM: If you guess wrong, you will go to jail.

02:55:08.518 --> 02:55:12.594
MATT: 54 points of piercing damage?

02:55:12.594 --> 02:55:15.686
TRAVIS: She's unconscious.

02:55:15.956 --> 02:55:18.769
LAURA: Oh no, oh no. Is he getting another
attack?

02:55:18.769 --> 02:55:20.849
MATT: Yasha is unconscious now.

02:55:21.552 --> 02:55:24.959
SAM: Someone do something! Someone do something!

02:55:24.959 --> 02:55:29.576
MATT: It has a rampage ability. When it reduces a
creature to zero hit points on a melee attack on

02:55:29.576 --> 02:55:33.721
its turn, it can make a bonus action to move up to
half speed and make a bite attack. So it's going to--

02:55:33.721 --> 02:55:35.201
LAURA: Isn't it slowed, though?

02:55:35.201 --> 02:55:36.978
MATT and LIAM: This is the other one.

02:55:36.978 --> 02:55:37.684
LAURA: Oh no.

02:55:37.684 --> 02:55:41.824
MATT: The other one is going to bonus action and
attack to you with a bite attack, Beau.

02:55:41.824 --> 02:55:43.299
MARISHA: Okay, okay. It's fine.

02:55:43.299 --> 02:55:49.568
MATT: That's a natural 18. It's going to be 26 to
hit.

02:55:49.568 --> 02:55:50.955
MARISHA: Yeah. That hits.

02:55:50.955 --> 02:55:53.250
SAM: It's Ashley's fault. Should have been here.

02:55:53.856 --> 02:55:55.289
LIAM: Start thinking.

02:55:55.289 --> 02:55:56.927
TALIESIN: We cool, we cool.

02:55:57.077 --> 02:55:58.632
SAM: "We cool, we cool"?!

02:55:58.632 --> 02:56:05.306
MATT: 24 points of piercing damage to you, Beau.
After it sinks its teeth into Yasha's shoulder and

02:56:05.306 --> 02:56:10.445
throws her to the ground, she falls. Her eyes roll
back, lids half open. It pulls back. You can see

02:56:10.445 --> 02:56:14.770
it tasting the blood in its mouth. Its eyes go
wide as the blood lust kicks in, and it turns

02:56:14.770 --> 02:56:19.147
towards you and lashes out again. You bring up
your staff to try and deflect it, but the jaws

02:56:19.147 --> 02:56:24.221
reach out and push it to your chest and clamp down
on your shoulder and chest. You pull yourself

02:56:24.221 --> 02:56:29.766
forward. The pain-- both the crushing pressure of
its jaws and the teeth sinking into your torso--

02:56:29.766 --> 02:56:35.317
is astronomical. As it has you there, it's tail
goes toward the back.

02:56:35.527 --> 02:56:38.158
MARISHA: Bad demon dog. Bad demon dog!

02:56:38.158 --> 02:56:40.787
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit.

02:56:41.127 --> 02:56:42.356
MARISHA: My AC is 20.

02:56:43.166 --> 02:56:44.249
MATT: That hits.

02:56:44.249 --> 02:56:46.458
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I'm working on it.

02:56:46.458 --> 02:56:48.886
TRAVIS: It's a constitution saving throw if it
hits.

02:56:48.886 --> 02:56:51.617
TALIESIN: You have a d4 on that constitution
saving throw.

02:56:51.617 --> 02:56:56.894
MATT: 17 points of piercing damage to you as you
feel it hit you right by the spine in where the

02:56:56.894 --> 02:57:02.559
left kidney is. It enters your body with a sharp pain,
and you need to make a constitution saving throw.

02:57:02.569 --> 02:57:16.688
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Where's my con save? Oh, plus
three. Thank you. Okay. Roll a d4. That's 18 plus

02:57:18.538 --> 02:57:19.937
three, so 21.

02:57:19.937 --> 02:57:25.045
MATT: The poison does not take hold. You feel it
enter the inside of your wound. The sharp pain

02:57:25.045 --> 02:57:30.846
that hits you is nowhere near as strong as your
monk's will to resist it. The control over your

02:57:30.846 --> 02:57:38.397
body and your organs and the systems within you
gaining as you continue to grow in experience and

02:57:38.397 --> 02:57:44.766
world understanding. You concentrate for a second
and the poison actually ejects from the wound. The

02:57:44.766 --> 02:57:47.617
muscles itself not allowing it to enter your
bloodstream.

02:57:47.617 --> 02:57:48.956
MARISHA: That's cool.

02:57:48.956 --> 02:57:55.562
MATT: That ends their turn. Actually, that one is
going to use its movement to attempt to leap up

02:57:55.562 --> 02:57:59.896
onto the top of the platform. You do get an
opportunity attack if you want to take it, Beau.

02:57:59.896 --> 02:58:01.329
LAURA: Kill it, Beau. Kill it.

02:58:01.329 --> 02:58:03.042
MATT: To try and keep it from going.

02:58:03.042 --> 02:58:11.599
MARISHA: Sentinel, as well. 15. That's what I
needed, right?

02:58:11.599 --> 02:58:14.559
MATT: Yep. He does not get the chance to shift
away.

02:58:14.559 --> 02:58:18.328
MARISHA: He does not move and he takes eight
damage.

02:58:18.328 --> 02:58:19.716
MATT: Eight points of damage.

02:58:19.716 --> 02:58:20.519
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:58:20.519 --> 02:58:25.133
MATT: All righty. That one is slowed. I believe at
the end of the turn it can make a wisdom saving

02:58:25.133 --> 02:58:31.971
throw. Let's see if it gets to remove the Slow.
Natural 19 plus five. It is no longer slowed.

02:58:31.971 --> 02:58:33.271
SAM: Oh man.

02:58:34.651 --> 02:58:37.829
LIAM: Okay, okay.

02:58:38.499 --> 02:58:42.203
MATT: That ends their turn. Now, it brings us to
Fjord's.

02:58:42.203 --> 02:58:49.572
TRAVIS: I have a quick question. The 54 points of
damage, was that halved? It wasn't, right? Because

02:58:49.572 --> 02:58:52.792
it was poison? The critical on Yasha?

02:58:52.792 --> 02:58:54.127
MATT: No, that was piercing.

02:58:54.127 --> 02:58:55.275
TRAVIS: It was piercing?

02:58:55.275 --> 02:58:57.039
LAURA: So it should have been halved?

02:58:57.039 --> 02:58:57.945
MATT: Correct, yes.

02:58:57.945 --> 02:59:00.486
TRAVIS: Okay. So help me. What is half of 54?

02:59:00.486 --> 02:59:01.602
LAURA: 22.

02:59:01.602 --> 02:59:02.562
SAM: 27.

02:59:02.562 --> 02:59:03.774
LAURA: Just kidding, 27.

02:59:03.774 --> 02:59:08.540
TRAVIS: Okay. She was actually at 56 points. So
she's--

02:59:08.540 --> 02:59:10.319
MATT: At the top of the round, right?

02:59:10.319 --> 02:59:11.197
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:59:11.197 --> 02:59:12.561
MATT: So she took that.

02:59:12.561 --> 02:59:16.924
TRAVIS: She was at 62 minus 8. And then--

02:59:17.834 --> 02:59:23.190
MATT: She took the bite attack at the beginning.
Or no, it was the tail attack.

02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:33.498
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. She was at 54. She was at 54
and she took half of 54. So she's still up.

02:59:33.498 --> 02:59:35.035
LAURA: So she's not unconscious.

02:59:35.035 --> 02:59:35.796
TRAVIS: Right.

02:59:35.796 --> 02:59:42.969
MATT: Okay. Well, as opposed to redoing all
of that scenario, she's still paralyzed, and

02:59:42.969 --> 02:59:44.177
she's in the space.

02:59:45.957 --> 02:59:48.168
MARISHA: She's alive? She's not unconscious?

02:59:48.168 --> 02:59:49.106
TALIESIN: That's a shame.

02:59:50.326 --> 02:59:52.136
SAM: It's a shame that she isn't dead?

02:59:52.136 --> 02:59:54.380
MATT: It was 54 at the top of the round?

02:59:54.380 --> 02:59:59.487
TRAVIS: No. 62 minus eight, and then the half of
the 54.

02:59:59.487 --> 03:00:03.865
MATT: Yeah, because the 16 reduced to eight, so it
would be, yeah. So she's still up.

03:00:03.865 --> 03:00:05.656
TRAVIS: What's half of 54?

03:00:05.656 --> 03:00:06.941
LAURA, SAM and MATT: 27.

03:00:06.941 --> 03:00:11.990
TRAVIS: Thank you. Got it. She's at exactly 27.
Sorry.

03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:13.274
TALIESIN: Yeah, that works.

03:00:13.274 --> 03:00:16.184
MATT: That round happened as it happened. Because
you didn't--

03:00:16.184 --> 03:00:19.756
TRAVIS: Dani and Max were screaming from the
lobby, "She's not unconscious!"

03:00:19.756 --> 03:00:21.612
MATT: Now you remember. Lesson learned.

03:00:21.612 --> 03:00:24.514
MARISHA: It's like you're playing two characters
or something.

03:00:24.514 --> 03:00:25.686
MATT: Exactly, I know.

03:00:25.686 --> 03:00:27.491
TALIESIN: We cool. We cool.

03:00:27.491 --> 03:00:30.097
MATT: That finishes their go. Fjord, it's your
turn.

03:00:30.097 --> 03:00:38.192
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah. I'm going to use all 30 feet
of my movement to head towards my comrades.

03:00:39.414 --> 03:00:40.794
Are the rats still a thing?

03:00:40.794 --> 03:00:44.453
MATT: (counting) 30. Yes. They haven't gone yet
this round. They're after you.

03:00:44.453 --> 03:00:48.182
TRAVIS: As long as I'm not-- no attack or
anything.

03:00:48.182 --> 03:00:50.472
TALIESIN: I've got a swarm. They'll attack them.

03:00:50.472 --> 03:00:52.285
MATT: They're currently next to Caleb.

03:00:52.285 --> 03:01:08.189
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to send two Eldritch--
boy. Boy, boy, boy.

03:01:08.264 --> 03:01:09.355
SAM: Oh boy.

03:01:09.995 --> 03:01:20.758
TRAVIS: Oh boy. I'm going to send two Eldritch
Blasts at one each.

03:01:20.978 --> 03:01:27.035
MATT: One each? Go for it. Go for the one that's
in front of you there.

03:01:28.211 --> 03:01:29.673
TRAVIS: That's a natural one.

03:01:29.933 --> 03:01:37.489
MATT: Oof. You go to fire. It's leaping up, and
you correct for it and fire up to catch it, but

03:01:37.489 --> 03:01:41.322
then Beau grabs its tail and drags it back down
and it ends up slamming into the rock where it was

03:01:41.322 --> 03:01:42.246
going to go.

03:01:42.246 --> 03:01:44.024
TRAVIS: That's fucking teamwork.

03:01:44.024 --> 03:01:48.501
MATT: The other one, it does have half cover
because it's by the wall, so it gets a plus two to

03:01:48.501 --> 03:01:50.075
its AC. What did you roll to hit?

03:01:50.075 --> 03:01:52.316
TRAVIS: It's a natural 15 plus eight, so it's--

03:01:52.316 --> 03:01:54.026
MATT: Yeah, you still hit. Roll damage.

03:01:54.026 --> 03:01:59.453
TRAVIS: 1d10. Plus five, that's ten, so 15 points
of Eldritch Blast.

03:01:59.453 --> 03:02:05.501
MATT: 15 points of force damage. The second one,
you release and it skids off the stone and hits it

03:02:05.501 --> 03:02:10.604
in the center of its jaw and nose and as it pulls
back, you can see this burn mark where the impact

03:02:10.604 --> 03:02:14.172
hit and the dent where you probably broken a part
of the front of its snout.

03:02:14.172 --> 03:02:15.266
TRAVIS: Awesome.

03:02:15.266 --> 03:02:16.605
MATT: That finish your turn?

03:02:16.605 --> 03:02:17.802
TRAVIS: That does, yes.

03:02:17.802 --> 03:02:23.514
MATT: All right. End of Fjord's go. The rats are
going to move up here, and move into Caleb's space.

03:02:23.514 --> 03:02:24.975
SAM: Rats attacking.

03:02:25.545 --> 03:02:31.486
TALIESIN: Are they getting away from me? Are they
the ones who attacked me, right?

03:02:31.756 --> 03:02:34.737
MATT: You moved out of the way, though, to try and
heal Nott.

03:02:34.737 --> 03:02:36.615
TALIESIN: That's right. Never mind.

03:02:37.155 --> 03:02:43.994
MATT: No, that's okay. All of a sudden, they swarm
into your space, Caleb. Finally, a decent roll for

03:02:43.994 --> 03:02:45.748
the rats. 17 to hit?

03:02:45.748 --> 03:02:47.000
TALIESIN: Minus a d4.

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.713
MATT: That's right. Minus a d4. 16 to hit.

03:02:49.713 --> 03:02:51.503
LIAM: 16? Shield, reaction.

03:02:51.503 --> 03:02:58.144
MATT: The rats leap up and all scatter back as the
arcane shield thrusts them down the stairs. They

03:02:58.144 --> 03:03:03.318
gather up again into a cluster right at the base
of your feet, and you're holding up the Shield.

03:03:03.318 --> 03:03:06.377
That ends their go. Caduceus, you're up.

03:03:06.377 --> 03:03:10.764
TALIESIN: Weird question: if someone falls
unconscious with paralysis and poison, if you heal

03:03:10.764 --> 03:03:14.233
them back to consciousness, they're still
paralyzed and poisoned, correct?

03:03:14.233 --> 03:03:15.049
MATT: Right.

03:03:15.049 --> 03:03:22.201
TALIESIN: Okay. Just checking. I'm going to move
30 feet in. I'm heading in that direction.

03:03:22.201 --> 03:03:23.770
MATT: (counting) 30. Right there?

03:03:23.770 --> 03:03:25.536
TALIESIN: Yep. As close as I can get.

03:03:25.536 --> 03:03:29.385
MATT: Okay. The rats do get an attack of
opportunity against you as you rush away.

03:03:29.385 --> 03:03:30.438
TALIESIN: That's fine.

03:03:30.438 --> 03:03:32.244
MATT: That is going to be a 20 to hit.

03:03:32.244 --> 03:03:33.346
TALIESIN: Minus the d4?

03:03:33.356 --> 03:03:38.532
MATT: Oh. Right. Another one. 19.

03:03:38.532 --> 03:03:39.785
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.

03:03:39.785 --> 03:03:46.206
MATT: That hits you? Okay. Rats are doing things
for once! Nine points of piercing damage to you.

03:03:46.206 --> 03:03:47.257
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:03:47.257 --> 03:03:51.646
MATT: And I need you to make a constitution saving
throw. You have advantage because you took

03:03:51.646 --> 03:03:52.607
War Caster, correct?

03:03:52.607 --> 03:03:54.943
TALIESIN: Yep. Yes, I did. Ten.

03:03:55.453 --> 03:04:01.027
MATT: Ten? You just manage to maintain
concentration on your Bless. Ten's the DC.

03:04:01.027 --> 03:04:02.470
All right. What are you doing?

03:04:02.470 --> 03:04:09.098
TALIESIN: Yeah, actually, I'm still trying to
remember how having a spell that exists as a bonus

03:04:09.098 --> 03:04:13.545
action. I have to use a cantrip as my action if I
want to use a spell as a bonus action.

03:04:13.545 --> 03:04:14.450
MATT: Correct.

03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:15.510
TALIESIN: Shudge.

03:04:15.510 --> 03:04:17.552
LIAM: One full level, one cantrip.

03:04:18.412 --> 03:04:23.919
TALIESIN: One full level, one cantrip. Okay. I'm
going to, instead of doing anything I want to do,

03:04:23.919 --> 03:04:26.960
I'm going to cast Bane on these two jokers.

03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:28.890
MATT: Okay. This Bane fades.

03:04:28.890 --> 03:04:34.036
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Actually, they get to make
another roll for it, because I can cast it on

03:04:34.036 --> 03:04:35.805
three things within 30 feet.

03:04:35.805 --> 03:04:37.942
MATT: That's true. Yeah. So we can do that.

03:04:37.942 --> 03:04:38.905
TRAVIS: Nice!

03:04:38.905 --> 03:04:41.234
MATT: All right. Is it wisdom?

03:04:41.234 --> 03:04:43.607
TALIESIN: Charisma, 16. Enjoy.

03:04:43.607 --> 03:04:48.186
MATT: Oh, charisma? Oh yeah. They're not that good
at charisma. The one on the far end there, natural

03:04:48.186 --> 03:04:50.512
three. He is Baned.

03:04:50.792 --> 03:04:52.105
TALIESIN: Fudge you.

03:04:52.105 --> 03:04:55.468
MATT: The one around the corner. That is a 17.

03:04:55.468 --> 03:04:56.903
TALIESIN: That, he-- yeah.

03:04:56.903 --> 03:04:59.774
MATT: Well, it's a 17 minus one, because his
charisma is 16.

03:04:59.774 --> 03:05:00.663
TALIESIN: So 16.

03:05:00.663 --> 03:05:05.774
MATT: So yeah, he does save. And the rats... No!
That is a six.

03:05:05.774 --> 03:05:07.924
TALIESIN: All right, got one swarm!

03:05:07.924 --> 03:05:11.491
MATT: Rats are like, "We're free! Aww." All right,
that finishes your turn?

03:05:11.831 --> 03:05:15.656
TALIESIN: As a bonus action, my swarm is going to
attack the rats.

03:05:15.656 --> 03:05:17.822
MATT: (laughs) Poor guys, can't go.

03:05:17.822 --> 03:05:21.869
TALIESIN: That's 22 to hit.

03:05:21.869 --> 03:05:27.482
MATT: Yeah, that hits. As they pounce on the
cluster of rats.

03:05:27.622 --> 03:05:30.131
TALIESIN: Just make sure I'm doing this right.

03:05:30.131 --> 03:05:31.404
MATT: I hate this.

03:05:33.854 --> 03:05:40.446
TALIESIN: That's-- ooh, that's nice! 14 points of
piercing damage.

03:05:40.446 --> 03:05:45.166
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage, all right. As
they're assaulting it and striking into it, you

03:05:45.166 --> 03:05:49.925
notice the nature of the swarms, it's hard to
hit, and they're clustering. So it takes the

03:05:49.925 --> 03:05:54.542
damage, but it's not taking as much as you would
think based on the nature of it being a swarm. So

03:05:54.542 --> 03:05:59.106
all the beetles are swarming in and attacking it,
the rats are defending themselves. It takes the

03:05:59.106 --> 03:06:01.060
damage, just not as much as you'd expect.

03:06:01.060 --> 03:06:01.816
TALIESIN: Boo.

03:06:01.816 --> 03:06:03.057
MATT: That ends your turn?

03:06:03.057 --> 03:06:03.780
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:06:03.780 --> 03:06:04.874
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

03:06:04.874 --> 03:06:09.305
LIAM: Okay, I am going to intentionally stride
through the rats. I know that I will be bitten,

03:06:09.305 --> 03:06:13.098
but I'm going to walk as far forward as I can, up
near Fjord and Caduceus.

03:06:13.098 --> 03:06:15.444
TALIESIN: They already took their reaction
anyway.

03:06:15.444 --> 03:06:16.165
MATT: Yeah.

03:06:16.165 --> 03:06:21.097
LIAM: Excellent. So, step away; I am pulling out
my little clay cat's paw, because I know that this

03:06:21.097 --> 03:06:28.030
hound from hell will find it offensive, and I will
cast Banishment on the healthier one; so the one

03:06:28.030 --> 03:06:29.995
on this side. Charisma, 16.

03:06:29.995 --> 03:06:31.732
MATT: Charisma 16!

03:06:31.732 --> 03:06:32.809
LIAM: Go to hell.

03:06:32.809 --> 03:06:33.968
MATT: No, he banished.

03:06:33.968 --> 03:06:35.948
(cheering)

03:06:35.948 --> 03:06:37.777
MARISHA: He banished, bitch!

03:06:40.417 --> 03:06:43.286
LAURA: If they belong on another plane, they don't
come back.

03:06:43.286 --> 03:06:45.885
LIAM: If the spell does not get interrupted, he's
gone.

03:06:45.885 --> 03:06:50.665
MATT: He's just sitting there and goes (snarl),
looks up at you for a second (escalating snarling),

03:06:50.665 --> 03:06:55.638
leaps in your direction, and (fssh) in a swirl
of arcane energy, and (pop) out of existence.

03:06:55.638 --> 03:06:58.015
LIAM: (brittle laugh) <i>Fick dich</i>.

03:06:58.025 --> 03:07:01.986
MATT: All righty. That finishes your go, Caleb.
Top of the round. Jester, you're up.

03:07:01.986 --> 03:07:09.083
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'm going to Guiding Bolt at
1st-level that guy.

03:07:09.083 --> 03:07:10.085
MATT: Okay.

03:07:12.475 --> 03:07:14.205
LAURA and TALIESIN: Natural 20!

03:07:14.205 --> 03:07:15.751
(cheering)

03:07:15.751 --> 03:07:16.867
MATT: That'll do.

03:07:16.877 --> 03:07:20.335
LAURA: Ey-oh, ey-oh, ey! Do I double my dice?

03:07:20.335 --> 03:07:21.621
MATT: You double your dice.

03:07:21.621 --> 03:07:22.985
LAURA: Woo!

03:07:22.985 --> 03:07:24.184
MARISHA: Don't roll ones.

03:07:24.184 --> 03:07:25.769
TALIESIN: Oh, that's pretty good.

03:07:25.769 --> 03:07:34.265
LAURA: 11, 14, 16 plus 12 is 28. 31!

03:07:34.265 --> 03:07:36.131
MATT: 31. How do you want to do this?

03:07:36.131 --> 03:07:38.716
(cheering)

03:07:38.716 --> 03:07:42.676
LAURA: Just because I haven't used my spiritual
weapon, I'm going to swing it up and slam it down

03:07:42.676 --> 03:07:44.542
at the same time I Guiding Bolt.

03:07:44.542 --> 03:07:50.909
MATT: Right as you release the Guiding Bolt, your
hand goes up, and you bring it down. As the

03:07:50.909 --> 03:07:57.889
luminous burst of divine, bright, white-blue
energy slams into the creature, sending it upward,

03:07:57.889 --> 03:08:03.817
reeling from the impact (squawk); at that point,
the giant lollipop swings and cracks it on the

03:08:03.817 --> 03:08:08.385
head. It just hits the ground, its legs sprawl
out, splayed, and it is done.

03:08:08.385 --> 03:08:12.903
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like a
round of applause in the cave.

03:08:12.903 --> 03:08:13.988
(applause)

03:08:13.988 --> 03:08:15.936
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you. A-thank you.

03:08:15.936 --> 03:08:17.981
LIAM: Squeak, squeak, squeak-squeak-squeak!

03:08:17.981 --> 03:08:20.086
TRAVIS: How long is that thing banished for?

03:08:20.086 --> 03:08:22.525
LIAM: Forever, if my spell doesn't get interrupted.

03:08:22.525 --> 03:08:23.320
TRAVIS: Amazing.

03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:24.724
LIAM: Banish it back to hell.

03:08:24.724 --> 03:08:25.476
SAM: Forever?

03:08:25.476 --> 03:08:28.918
LIAM: If it were from this plane, it's temporary.
If it's from another plane, it stays in its plane

03:08:28.918 --> 03:08:30.108
if I don't get fucked up.

03:08:30.108 --> 03:08:34.348
TALIESIN: Yeah, it doesn't have a hold here, so
there's nothing to tether it back to the mortal plane.

03:08:34.348 --> 03:08:35.216
LIAM: <i>Ja. Ja-ja-ja!</i>

03:08:35.216 --> 03:08:37.735
SAM: Wait, what? How would your spell get
interrupted?

03:08:37.745 --> 03:08:39.886
LIAM: Me getting hit, and dropping the spell.

03:08:39.886 --> 03:08:40.603
SAM: Just ever?

03:08:40.603 --> 03:08:41.312
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:08:41.312 --> 03:08:43.026
TALIESIN: No; just when it got cast.

03:08:43.026 --> 03:08:47.403
LIAM: Within one minute, if I get punched in the
face and lose the spell, it could come back.

03:08:47.403 --> 03:08:51.252
SAM: And if you don't get punched in the face in
the minute, then nothing happens.

03:08:51.252 --> 03:08:53.539
MATT: Do you want to move or stay where you are?

03:08:53.539 --> 03:08:57.052
LAURA: I'm going to walk through and stomp on the
rats as I join the party.

03:08:57.052 --> 03:09:00.001
MATT: You got it. Okay, that finishes your go.
Nott, your turn.

03:09:00.001 --> 03:09:01.436
SAM: There's nothing else to--

03:09:01.436 --> 03:09:02.815
LAURA and MATT: There's rats.

03:09:02.815 --> 03:09:03.603
SAM: (groan) Oh.

03:09:03.603 --> 03:09:05.174
MATT: And they're coming for you!

03:09:06.202 --> 03:09:10.017
TRAVIS: We do technically need to take care of
banished beast when it comes back.

03:09:10.017 --> 03:09:11.554
LAURA: No, it's not coming back.

03:09:11.554 --> 03:09:13.517
SAM: That's what I'm confused about, too.

03:09:13.517 --> 03:09:15.180
TRAVIS: I'm going to sit over here.

03:09:15.180 --> 03:09:19.380
LIAM: Unless I get punched in the face, it's <i>not
coming back</i>. Don't punch me in the face.

03:09:19.450 --> 03:09:21.314
SAM: I punch Caleb in the face.

03:09:22.543 --> 03:09:24.220
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for it.

03:09:24.220 --> 03:09:31.089
SAM: No, I will go over to the rats. Or I'll
just-- I'll throw a vial of acid at the rats.

03:09:31.089 --> 03:09:34.426
MATT: Sure, okay. They make a dexterity check,
right?

03:09:34.426 --> 03:09:41.420
SAM: I believe so. It says I can splash it onto a
creature within five feet of me, or throw it up to

03:09:41.420 --> 03:09:48.432
20 feet, shattering on impact. So it doesn't say
what they save as, it just says 2d6 acid damage.

03:09:48.432 --> 03:09:53.093
MATT: Oh sorry, then just make a just general
dexterity-- roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier.

03:09:53.093 --> 03:09:53.887
SAM: Ugh.

03:09:53.887 --> 03:09:56.791
LAURA: You should have just walked up and splashed
it on them.

03:09:56.791 --> 03:09:58.752
SAM: Yeah, well I didn't. Eight.

03:09:58.752 --> 03:10:06.184
MATT: Eight? It misses. You watch as the rats go
(squeak) and get prepared for impact, and it hits

03:10:06.184 --> 03:10:09.701
the stone, and they (slower squeaking).

03:10:09.701 --> 03:10:11.335
MARISHA: Oh, that's cute!

03:10:11.335 --> 03:10:12.732
SAM: I will hide.

03:10:12.732 --> 03:10:16.081
(laughter)

03:10:16.081 --> 03:10:19.679
MATT: Yeah, because you still had disadvantage on
that, because you were poisoned anyway. Did you

03:10:19.679 --> 03:10:20.850
add a d4 to your roll?

03:10:20.850 --> 03:10:23.163
SAM: It doesn't matter. It was only an eight.

03:10:23.163 --> 03:10:23.970
LAURA: Well.

03:10:23.970 --> 03:10:25.233
SAM: Now it's an 11.

03:10:25.233 --> 03:10:26.238
LIAM: They're rats!

03:10:26.238 --> 03:10:27.671
MATT: That makes a difference.

03:10:27.671 --> 03:10:28.726
LAURA: See, it worked?

03:10:28.726 --> 03:10:30.871
SAM: Wait, shouldn't I have had disadvantage?

03:10:30.881 --> 03:10:33.123
MATT: But you have disadvantage, so roll again.

03:10:33.123 --> 03:10:33.889
SAM: Natural 20.

03:10:33.889 --> 03:10:34.704
TALIESIN: Oh, 11.

03:10:34.704 --> 03:10:36.512
MATT: So yeah, that does actually hit.

03:10:36.512 --> 03:10:37.220
MARISHA: Hey!

03:10:37.220 --> 03:10:41.370
MATT: In the alternate reality in which they
winced and turned, they're like, "Aww, That

03:10:41.370 --> 03:10:46.088
"would've been great." However, their imagination
ran wild with them, as the reality is, they took--

03:10:46.088 --> 03:10:47.429
SAM: Eight points of damage.

03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:49.760
MARISHA: They had their own Jacob's Ladder
moment.

03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:52.752
LIAM: Yes, the 20 rats. So 20,000 rats in the
dodecahedron.

03:10:52.752 --> 03:10:55.959
MARISHA: (whooshing) This timeline.

03:10:55.959 --> 03:11:01.743
MATT: A bunch of baby rats in space, looking over
Earth. The monolith floats up. So the swarm is

03:11:01.743 --> 03:11:06.968
still alive, but their numbers are very reduced.
You hear the horrible, screaming hisses as a bunch

03:11:06.968 --> 03:11:16.611
of these distraught, subterranean, hungry rats
begin to dissolve and wither into these small

03:11:16.611 --> 03:11:22.172
little puddles of fur and flesh, but they're still
around. That finishes your go, Nott.

03:11:22.172 --> 03:11:22.934
SAM: Yeah.

03:11:22.934 --> 03:11:24.952
MATT: Yasha's up. Yasha is paralyzed.

03:11:24.952 --> 03:11:27.020
TRAVIS: (muffled, inaudible speech)

03:11:27.020 --> 03:11:30.465
MATT: Yep, at the end of its turn, it can make a
saving throw.

03:11:30.465 --> 03:11:31.230
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:11:31.230 --> 03:11:32.605
MATT: Constitution save.

03:11:32.605 --> 03:11:35.321
TRAVIS: Let's do it! 16.

03:11:35.321 --> 03:11:36.869
MATT: 16? She succeeds.

03:11:36.869 --> 03:11:41.410
TRAVIS: Yeah! With her bonus--

03:11:41.410 --> 03:11:42.716
MATT: That's her turn.

03:11:42.716 --> 03:11:43.993
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

03:11:43.993 --> 03:11:47.147
MATT: Yeah. With a bonus action, that's your turn.
Beau, you're up.

03:11:47.147 --> 03:11:52.043
MARISHA: Sorry! Sorry, rats. Sorry.

03:11:52.743 --> 03:11:54.113
SAM: Just curb stomping.

03:11:54.113 --> 03:11:57.956
MARISHA: Just take my stick, and right in their
heads.

03:11:57.956 --> 03:11:58.960
LAURA: So sad.

03:11:58.960 --> 03:12:00.107
MARISHA: It's real sad.

03:12:00.107 --> 03:12:01.824
LAURA: Why don't they just run away?

03:12:01.824 --> 03:12:04.828
MARISHA: I know. Sorry. I kick a few, then I'm
like: Shoo. Shoo.

03:12:04.828 --> 03:12:06.307
MATT: Just roll an attack roll.

03:12:06.307 --> 03:12:07.009
MARISHA: Okay.

03:12:07.009 --> 03:12:08.771
TALIESIN: And you still have your d4!

03:12:08.771 --> 03:12:13.163
MARISHA: That's pretty good. 19 plus 20 total.

03:12:13.163 --> 03:12:15.221
MATT: Yeah, so roll damage.

03:12:15.221 --> 03:12:16.276
LIAM: Batter up!

03:12:16.276 --> 03:12:18.129
TRAVIS: I might have to get a new iPad.

03:12:18.129 --> 03:12:19.654
LAURA: Somebody's going to get--

03:12:19.654 --> 03:12:21.746
TRAVIS: Safari keeps crashing on this thing.

03:12:21.746 --> 03:12:22.524
MATT: Oh, buddy.

03:12:22.524 --> 03:12:24.426
TALIESIN: Oh, we haven't updated. Oh no!

03:12:24.426 --> 03:12:26.941
SAM: No, it's the tablet. It's not D&amp;D Beyond.

03:12:26.941 --> 03:12:28.808
TRAVIS: No, it's Safari. It's the iPad.

03:12:28.808 --> 03:12:30.520
MARISHA: 11 damage on the first one.

03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:32.620
MATT: 11 damage. How do you want to do this?

03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:33.321
LAURA: Woo!

03:12:33.321 --> 03:12:35.607
TALIESIN: There was an update that we probably--

03:12:35.607 --> 03:12:39.612
MARISHA: I try to save as many as I can by shooing
some away.

03:12:39.612 --> 03:12:42.463
MATT: A few do shoo off, and it's like (squeaking)
dart off--

03:12:42.463 --> 03:12:45.785
MARISHA: The ones that are half hanging on by the
acid from Nott, I just--

03:12:46.155 --> 03:12:47.824
MATT: Put them out of their misery.

03:12:47.824 --> 03:12:48.643
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:48.643 --> 03:12:50.159
MATT: Okay. One by one.

03:12:50.959 --> 03:12:52.232
MARISHA: Just little pops.

03:12:52.232 --> 03:12:58.010
MATT: The rats are finished. Caleb, you sit there
and concentrate for the full minute, and then

03:12:58.820 --> 03:13:03.667
the spell is finished. The tether is disconnected,
and the creature is banished to its hellish realm

03:13:03.667 --> 03:13:06.595
where it once stemmed from.

03:13:06.595 --> 03:13:10.115
LAURA: Is there a portal or something in here?
Should we look for a portal?

03:13:10.115 --> 03:13:11.970
SAM: Maybe we should look for a portal.

03:13:11.970 --> 03:13:14.450
LAURA: Make sure no others are going to come
through.

03:13:14.450 --> 03:13:15.878
TALIESIN: Anybody who's hurt--

03:13:15.878 --> 03:13:17.968
TRAVIS: Yasha raises her hand; says, "Ouch."

03:13:17.968 --> 03:13:22.919
TALIESIN: So anybody who's hurt, come sit over
here for a second. Do they get to save against the

03:13:22.919 --> 03:13:25.502
poison or should I just do that?

03:13:25.882 --> 03:13:31.753
MATT: No, they're no longer poisoned. The
paralysis and the poison are gone. They're both

03:13:31.753 --> 03:13:32.734
hand in hand.

03:13:32.734 --> 03:13:34.451
TALIESIN: Nott as well; is she okay?

03:13:34.451 --> 03:13:35.212
MATT: Hmm?

03:13:35.212 --> 03:13:37.369
TALIESIN: Nott's not poisoned anymore either?

03:13:37.369 --> 03:13:41.248
MATT: That's still-- No, because you were--
because the poison-- hmm.

03:13:41.248 --> 03:13:44.250
TALIESIN: I can cast the spell and make it go away
if I have to.

03:13:44.250 --> 03:13:49.616
MATT: While poisoned, target is paralyzed. So
interesting point: yes, actually. Your poisoned

03:13:49.616 --> 03:13:52.659
and paralysis are gone. The two are tethered
together.

03:13:52.659 --> 03:13:57.064
TALIESIN: So anybody who wants to get some
healing, I'm going to be doing a Prayer of Healing

03:13:57.064 --> 03:13:58.781
over the next ten minutes.

03:13:58.901 --> 03:14:05.509
MARISHA: I go get healed, but I'm distracted the
whole time I'm getting healed, looking at the

03:14:05.509 --> 03:14:09.646
unconscious demon dog.

03:14:11.406 --> 03:14:13.686
MATT: That demon dog is close to expiring.

03:14:13.686 --> 03:14:14.720
MARISHA: Oh.

03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:16.203
MATT: It's not dead yet.

03:14:16.653 --> 03:14:19.823
MARISHA: I just watch him as I get healed by
Caduceus.

03:14:19.823 --> 03:14:22.648
LAURA: Nugget! Come in here.

03:14:22.648 --> 03:14:27.557
MATT: (panting, poof) Just teleports, blinks to
you.

03:14:27.557 --> 03:14:30.795
TRAVIS: Oh, get a critical hit for Nugget and
dispatch the demon dog.

03:14:31.575 --> 03:14:32.511
LAURA: What?

03:14:32.511 --> 03:14:34.982
TRAVIS: Have Nugget finish off the demon dog.

03:14:34.982 --> 03:14:36.463
LAURA: Oh, the unconscious one?

03:14:36.463 --> 03:14:40.316
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Let it taste blood.

03:14:40.316 --> 03:14:43.380
TALIESIN: 21 healing points to anybody who wants
them.

03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:45.231
TRAVIS, SAM, LIAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

03:14:45.231 --> 03:14:51.314
TALIESIN: Let's make sure. How many people are
taking that? One, two, three, four, and I will be

03:14:51.314 --> 03:14:53.267
five. Cool. You were good?

03:14:53.267 --> 03:14:54.403
LAURA: I'm good.

03:14:54.833 --> 03:14:58.050
SAM: Should we try to wake this fiendish thing and
tame it?

03:14:58.050 --> 03:14:59.749
LAURA: Should we just kill it?

03:14:59.749 --> 03:15:01.983
MARISHA: He's very almost dead, whatever it is.

03:15:01.983 --> 03:15:14.905
LAURA: Nugget, bite him! Don't bite him; you're
too sweet. Don't bite anything. Here, have some candy.

03:15:16.625 --> 03:15:21.109
MATT: He gets down and starts tearing the candy
apart on the ground. Nugget's not full-grown at

03:15:21.109 --> 03:15:27.965
this point. He's still a puppy, but a big puppy,
getting to about that size, and not really knowing

03:15:27.965 --> 03:15:32.718
the full size of the animal, you're already like,
"Oh, this is going to be a big boy."

03:15:32.718 --> 03:15:34.440
LIAM: What did you just feed him?

03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:35.219
LAURA: Candy!

03:15:35.219 --> 03:15:36.317
LIAM: What kind?

03:15:36.317 --> 03:15:40.711
LAURA: Do you want some? I have peppermints, I
have some cherry suckers, and I have--

03:15:40.711 --> 03:15:42.371
LIAM: Just not chocolate, yeah?

03:15:42.371 --> 03:15:43.418
LAURA: No chocolate.

03:15:43.418 --> 03:15:46.324
TRAVIS: I take the falchion and stick it in the
back of the neck of the demon dog.

03:15:46.324 --> 03:15:50.145
MATT: It exhales its final breath and goes still.

03:15:50.145 --> 03:15:56.102
TALIESIN: Mister Caleb, maybe we should take a
look around and see where these things came from.

03:15:56.102 --> 03:15:59.165
SAM: Good idea. I will join you.

03:16:00.495 --> 03:16:04.331
MATT: Either two of you make investigation checks,
or one person does with advantage.

03:16:04.331 --> 03:16:08.827
LIAM: Investigation at advantage because someone's
helping me?

03:16:08.827 --> 03:16:11.174
SAM: I will do an investigation check as well.

03:16:11.174 --> 03:16:13.479
MATT: All right, both of you guys take one.

03:16:15.096 --> 03:16:16.062
SAM: A million.

03:16:16.062 --> 03:16:17.024
LIAM: 24.

03:16:17.024 --> 03:16:18.827
MATT: 24 and a million.

03:16:19.667 --> 03:16:20.758
SAM: 26.

03:16:20.758 --> 03:16:29.659
MATT: Okay! You guys move along, stepping over the
corpses of the two creatures. The rotting-flesh

03:16:29.659 --> 03:16:34.392
smell that you smelled when you first came into the
chamber, when you get close to these creatures--

03:16:34.392 --> 03:16:39.471
now that the adrenaline has worn off and you can
actually take a moment to process all the senses--

03:16:39.471 --> 03:16:50.624
this very molded-citrus-type, acrid smell emanates
from their bodies along with long-rotted flesh. It is

03:16:50.624 --> 03:16:58.035
an awful smell from these creatures. In ways,
parts of them remind you of hyena-dogs with these

03:16:58.035 --> 03:17:05.445
large ridges along the back of the spine, the tail
extremely venomous. You guys move past and head

03:17:05.445 --> 03:17:11.771
around the other corner. You pass by other bones
and other corpses of what were smaller

03:17:11.771 --> 03:17:22.541
moorbounders, pups that were being trained or
risen and fed, and in the back corner, Nott, you

03:17:22.541 --> 03:17:32.755
see it first and Caleb just seconds after, there
is this faint glow, this very faint red glow. It

03:17:32.755 --> 03:17:39.629
looks like a crack in the stone. You approach and
look at it, and as soon as you look at a side

03:17:39.629 --> 03:17:45.947
angle, the crack isn't on the stone; it's about an
inch away from it. It's in the air, and it's about

03:17:45.947 --> 03:17:49.996
two feet across, like that, and about an inch
sliver.

03:17:51.949 --> 03:17:54.477
SAM: Should we stick our hands through there?

03:17:54.477 --> 03:17:56.035
LIAM: No, we should not do that.

03:17:56.035 --> 03:17:57.468
TRAVIS: That's what I'm for.

03:17:57.878 --> 03:18:03.711
LIAM: No, this is where the problem is coming
from. I'm not sure what to do about it, though.

03:18:03.711 --> 03:18:10.532
SAM: Can we seal it? Can we un-magic it? Yasha!
Yasha, you have-- Oh, do you have a dispel?

03:18:10.732 --> 03:18:11.694
LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:11.884 --> 03:18:12.785
SAM: Jester!

03:18:14.765 --> 03:18:17.498
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to Dispel Magic.

03:18:17.698 --> 03:18:22.506
MATT: Okay, make a wisdom check. Roll a d20 and
add your wisdom modifier.

03:18:26.479 --> 03:18:28.054
LAURA: 15 plus eight.

03:18:28.464 --> 03:18:30.927
MATT: Plus your wisdom modifier.

03:18:30.927 --> 03:18:34.168
LAURA: Sorry, 15 plus five.

03:18:34.168 --> 03:18:35.014
MATT: 20?

03:18:35.014 --> 03:18:35.661
LAURA: Yes.

03:18:35.661 --> 03:18:41.711
MATT: 20 is the DC you needed. As Jester steps
forward, you see through the crack. It begins to

03:18:41.711 --> 03:18:48.211
slowly widen, and for a split second as she's
concentrating and focusing, for a split second

03:18:48.211 --> 03:18:58.766
beyond that there's red and purple and you hear
this faint swirling of wind and screams and who

03:18:58.766 --> 03:19:07.015
knows beyond the veil, and you can see another one
of those creatures starting to come up and sniff

03:19:07.015 --> 03:19:13.354
the other side of this rift, and right as it looks
through, its eye peeking out from the other side,

03:19:13.354 --> 03:19:17.393
it seals and is gone.

03:19:17.393 --> 03:19:18.256
SAM: You did it!

03:19:18.256 --> 03:19:19.184
LAURA: I did it!

03:19:19.184 --> 03:19:20.821
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

03:19:22.601 --> 03:19:27.174
LAURA: Good, because I don't know if we could have
fought another one of those guys, you know? We

03:19:27.174 --> 03:19:28.959
totally could have taken another one.

03:19:28.959 --> 03:19:35.332
LIAM: We need to convince our goblin friend
upstairs that we have performed some form of

03:19:35.332 --> 03:19:40.616
exorcism on top of the killing part, so hopefully
we get a better deal, even.

03:19:40.616 --> 03:19:43.966
TRAVIS: Yeah, where did that rift even go?

03:19:44.506 --> 03:19:50.220
MARISHA: Well, it feels like some sort of fiendish
enemies that we were fighting, so I'm assuming

03:19:50.620 --> 03:19:52.280
the Nine Hells?

03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:54.558
LIAM: Have you not read of the Hells?

03:19:55.328 --> 03:19:58.252
MARISHA: Would I know where those things might
have come from?

03:19:58.252 --> 03:20:04.358
MATT: You can either make an arcana or maybe a
religion check.

03:20:04.558 --> 03:20:13.176
MARISHA: I'll do the religion because I've read
about rel-- okay, 16.

03:20:13.376 --> 03:20:18.594
MATT: 16? Looking at these creatures, the essence
of them, especially since you've extracted their

03:20:18.594 --> 03:20:24.913
aspects, you've taken the time to think it over.
Fiendish, definitely. Not devil.

03:20:25.643 --> 03:20:27.038
MARISHA: Which is Nine Hells.

03:20:27.038 --> 03:20:27.731
MATT: Correct.

03:20:27.731 --> 03:20:28.981
MARISHA: So this is abyssal.

03:20:28.981 --> 03:20:35.710
MATT: This is abyssal. The chaotic nature of its
form, the little glimpse beyond that you saw, and

03:20:35.710 --> 03:20:42.534
the general smell that remains after it, is less
of the essence of brimstone and other such smells

03:20:42.534 --> 03:20:48.583
that seem to accompany rifts or doorways that lead
to the Nine Hells, and instead the smell here is

03:20:48.583 --> 03:20:53.412
something else entirely. Based on all these things
together, you're pretty certain that this was an

03:20:53.412 --> 03:20:54.627
abyssal creature.

03:20:55.137 --> 03:20:56.505
LIAM: You share that?

03:20:56.505 --> 03:20:58.255
MARISHA: Abyssal dogs.

03:20:59.525 --> 03:21:04.115
TRAVIS: Was the rift just large enough for a
creature like that to come through, or was it larger?

03:21:04.115 --> 03:21:09.277
MATT: It looked at the moment like a creature that
size could maybe squeeze through, but you also saw

03:21:09.277 --> 03:21:15.111
it begin to expand as the creature began to draw
near. So it may have had some level of flexibility.

03:21:15.111 --> 03:21:18.183
TRAVIS: So not like something else came through
before.

03:21:18.183 --> 03:21:22.296
TALIESIN: Well I mean, I don't know. These things
could happen.

03:21:23.066 --> 03:21:27.733
TRAVIS: I walk over to the first demon dog, and
I'll take the falchion and cut the stinger off the

03:21:27.733 --> 03:21:33.382
tail, and hand it over to Caduceus and go:
Shouldn't we maybe hold onto these for something?

03:21:33.852 --> 03:21:37.685
TALIESIN: I would talk to Nott about that. It's
not a terrible idea.

03:21:37.685 --> 03:21:42.304
TRAVIS: Really venomous and poisonous. Paralytics
and all?

03:21:43.354 --> 03:21:45.562
LAURA: You should give the other one to Yasha.

03:21:45.562 --> 03:21:50.337
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if the spores will take
in these things or not. I don't know if they will.

03:21:50.337 --> 03:21:59.774
MATT: Okay. The fiendish nature is resistant to
the spores, but not immune. Meaning you're used to

03:21:59.774 --> 03:22:05.869
your Decomposition being rather rapid. It is
beginning, but it is a slower process.

03:22:05.869 --> 03:22:09.393
TALIESIN: That's interesting. That's very
interesting.

03:22:10.343 --> 03:22:16.280
LIAM: You know, this is interesting, because when
I was at your library, one of the many things that

03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:21.288
I discovered there that day is that-- Do you want
to finish talking?

03:22:21.288 --> 03:22:22.384
MATT: Continue.

03:22:22.654 --> 03:22:31.240
LIAM: That the empire here, the Kryn Dynasty,
there was mention of Tharizdun.

03:22:32.730 --> 03:22:34.819
MARISHA: Ter-is-doom?

03:22:34.819 --> 03:22:36.428
LIAM and MARISHA: Tharizdun.

03:22:36.428 --> 03:22:38.227
SAM: What is that? Is that a place?

03:22:38.927 --> 03:22:53.856
LIAM: A terrible, dark god. From ages past.
Affecting the people here, coming up from below.

03:22:53.856 --> 03:23:02.483
And we find this here, just this close to the
surface? Maybe it's coincidence. Maybe not.

03:23:02.483 --> 03:23:12.212
MATT: To clarify, just because you would know, the
research that you uncovered deals in drow cultures

03:23:12.212 --> 03:23:21.086
and what's written on them. There are connections
to Tharizdun, and a madness that is known to have

03:23:21.086 --> 03:23:25.737
claimed much of the Tal'Dorei drow and the
Underdark that resides there.

03:23:25.737 --> 03:23:27.095
LIAM: Tal'Dorei drow?

03:23:27.095 --> 03:23:35.171
MATT: Correct. But there is speculation within
imperial books and research that perhaps the

03:23:35.171 --> 03:23:37.579
same madness is also spreading in the east.

03:23:38.289 --> 03:23:47.495
LIAM: Hmm. Okay. Well, Caleb would not have
understood everything that he found that day.

03:23:47.495 --> 03:23:50.889
MATT: Correct. No, it's true. Just letting you
know.

03:23:54.639 --> 03:24:04.188
SAM: Can I see if there's any poison I can extract
from these stingers? With my expert medicine checks?

03:24:06.498 --> 03:24:10.585
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make a medicine or nature
check on this, I'd say. Your choice.

03:24:10.585 --> 03:24:11.870
LAURA: Want me to help you?

03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:12.640
SAM: Yes!

03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:17.310
LAURA: Can I help him? Because I got proficiency
in medicine. I know what I'm doing.

03:24:17.310 --> 03:24:19.760
SAM: I'll look for the chemicals, you look for
the--

03:24:19.760 --> 03:24:20.873
LAURA: The veins.

03:24:20.873 --> 03:24:22.726
SAM: The veins, you look for the veins.

03:24:22.726 --> 03:24:23.740
MATT: Go for it.

03:24:23.930 --> 03:24:28.752
SAM: Natural 20. Should I roll again?

03:24:28.752 --> 03:24:29.571
LAURA: No.

03:24:29.571 --> 03:24:30.516
SAM: No, that's it.

03:24:30.516 --> 03:24:33.516
LAURA: Wouldn't it be amazing if it was two
natural 20s, though?

03:24:33.516 --> 03:24:41.038
MATT: Anyway, it takes you a little bit of time
and you manage to extract-- unfortunately, due to

03:24:41.038 --> 03:24:49.373
the state of its body, once it dies, the toxin
begins to separate and suffuse its own flesh and

03:24:49.373 --> 03:24:56.141
system. But you do manage to extract a vial of its
venom.

03:24:56.141 --> 03:24:57.611
TRAVIS: Some vicious shit.

03:24:57.611 --> 03:24:59.832
SAM: That's paralysis venom, right?

03:25:00.122 --> 03:25:01.177
MATT: Possibly.

03:25:01.177 --> 03:25:02.754
TALIESIN: That could be mean.

03:25:04.924 --> 03:25:06.785
TRAVIS: Poisoned and paralytic.

03:25:06.785 --> 03:25:09.253
LAURA: Like how big of a vial? Like a skinny
kind?

03:25:09.253 --> 03:25:11.174
MATT: Like a single application.

03:25:11.174 --> 03:25:12.383
TALIESIN: One run.

03:25:13.643 --> 03:25:18.207
MATT: It's smaller than those; it's about that
big. Because it has to be purified element. It's

03:25:18.207 --> 03:25:25.067
good for one application, whether that be weapon,
or imbibed, or whatever the case may be.

03:25:25.067 --> 03:25:26.270
LIAM: Killer app.

03:25:27.250 --> 03:25:28.960
SAM: Okay, thank you.

03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:34.529
MATT: So you got that. You do know, with your
natural 20, that there is a shelf life on the

03:25:34.529 --> 03:25:43.418
toxin, meaning over time it might become diluted.
But with the natural 20, you also know that's

03:25:43.418 --> 03:25:48.936
probably weeks, if not months away. But there is
an eventual shelf life on its potency.

03:25:48.936 --> 03:25:50.525
LIAM: Should you use it now?

03:25:50.525 --> 03:25:51.812
TALIESIN: Right now.

03:25:52.352 --> 03:25:54.045
MATT: Just jabs Caleb.

03:25:58.385 --> 03:26:08.063
TRAVIS: Well, we've successfully cleared the
demons. This cave is clear.

03:26:09.737 --> 03:26:12.695
LAURA: We should disguise ourselves again before
we go back up.

03:26:12.695 --> 03:26:14.311
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good call.

03:26:14.311 --> 03:26:19.020
TALIESIN: I'm going to look a little different no
matter what because I can only do that once a day,

03:26:19.020 --> 03:26:19.902
but that's okay.

03:26:19.902 --> 03:26:20.604
LAURA: Oh no.

03:26:20.604 --> 03:26:21.895
TALIESIN: That's all right.

03:26:21.915 --> 03:26:26.434
LAURA: We'll just make you look kind of dirty and
stuff. I start rubbing dirt all over Caduceus.

03:26:26.434 --> 03:26:29.242
TALIESIN: This stuff is-- not this dirt. This is
weird dirt.

03:26:29.242 --> 03:26:31.335
LIAM: Do you want your horns and dick again?

03:26:31.335 --> 03:26:32.061
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:26:32.711 --> 03:26:36.997
LIAM: Okay, I start waving the caterpillar cocoon
in front of her face and give her a wang.

03:26:36.997 --> 03:26:39.604
MARISHA: (coughing) That's dusty.

03:26:41.684 --> 03:26:47.296
MATT: You reclaim your respective illusions and/or
transformations.

03:26:47.296 --> 03:26:48.917
TRAVIS: (bulking up noises)

03:26:48.917 --> 03:26:50.481
MATT: (laughs) Perfect.

03:26:50.481 --> 03:26:54.961
MARISHA: (laughs) Macy's Day float over here.

03:26:54.961 --> 03:26:56.482
TRAVIS: (lower pitched) 'Sup?

03:26:58.197 --> 03:27:07.433
MATT: You ascend back into Zorth's Pits. As you
make your way up towards the top, the trap door is

03:27:07.433 --> 03:27:11.667
actually closed. As you go to open it, it is
currently locked.

03:27:11.667 --> 03:27:13.539
MARISHA: Oh, goddamn it.

03:27:13.539 --> 03:27:14.717
TRAVIS: (knocks)

03:27:14.717 --> 03:27:15.583
MATT: "Yes?"

03:27:15.583 --> 03:27:16.641
TRAVIS: We're done.

03:27:16.641 --> 03:27:17.764
MATT: "Is it you?"

03:27:17.764 --> 03:27:21.269
TRAVIS: Yes, it's us. What, you think they talk or
something?

03:27:21.269 --> 03:27:24.705
MATT: "I don't know about these things! Just being
safe, come on."

03:27:24.705 --> 03:27:26.065
TRAVIS: Open the door!

03:27:26.225 --> 03:27:32.733
MATT: "All right, just hold on a second."
(multiple locks clicking) You hear chains being

03:27:32.733 --> 03:27:40.585
pulled. Eventually it gets pushed open and he's
kicked the lid of it open. The actual doorway

03:27:40.585 --> 03:27:43.864
falls back and leans against the wall. He looks
down. "So is it done?"

03:27:43.864 --> 03:27:45.830
TRAVIS: Oh god, there's another one! Run!

03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:46.761
MATT: (screams)

03:27:46.761 --> 03:27:48.226
TRAVIS: Nah, I'm just kidding.

03:27:48.226 --> 03:27:51.237
MATT: "Tricksy orc."

03:27:51.237 --> 03:27:52.412
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:27:53.232 --> 03:27:57.882
MATT: "All right, come on up. So what was it?
What'd you do? What'd you kill? Was it done? Are

03:27:57.882 --> 03:27:59.903
"you sure? What proof you got?"

03:27:59.908 --> 03:28:05.208
TRAVIS: Actually, we left them down there for you
if you're interested in, I don't know, harvesting

03:28:05.238 --> 03:28:08.226
pieces of-- what was it, demon creatures?

03:28:08.226 --> 03:28:09.859
LIAM: Fiends, for sure.

03:28:09.859 --> 03:28:16.289
MATT: He looks you over real close and goes, "I
don't know why, but I believe you. Okay, I'll go

03:28:16.289 --> 03:28:21.486
"down and take a look. Just checking, didn't know
if it was some sort of a pull one over on me and

03:28:21.486 --> 03:28:23.677
"take my business, so I'm just being careful."

03:28:23.677 --> 03:28:25.673
TRAVIS: Did you want to go look right now?

03:28:25.673 --> 03:28:26.755
MATT: "Yeah!"

03:28:27.945 --> 03:28:35.484
LAURA: Okay, but you should know that you had a
portal to another dimension in your cave.

03:28:35.484 --> 03:28:36.737
TALIESIN: That's true.

03:28:36.737 --> 03:28:41.896
LAURA: I had to close it. It was not pretty, but
you should be careful, because if it opens again,

03:28:41.896 --> 03:28:43.953
what are you going to do, you know?

03:28:43.963 --> 03:28:45.625
MATT: (quietly) "That's not good."

03:28:45.625 --> 03:28:49.460
LAURA: Do you know why it happened? Have you ever
seen that kind of thing before?

03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:52.078
SAM: Yeah have you heard of something similar
happening?

03:28:52.078 --> 03:28:59.295
MATT: He lifts one foot up and scratches the edge
of his temple and goes. "No, I haven't. That's

03:28:59.295 --> 03:29:02.743
pretty dangerous, isn't it?"

03:29:02.743 --> 03:29:03.690
LAURA: It is.

03:29:03.930 --> 03:29:06.190
MATT: "Would you guys let the Lady know maybe?"

03:29:06.190 --> 03:29:07.525
TALIESIN: The what?

03:29:07.525 --> 03:29:08.420
LAURA: The Lady?

03:29:08.420 --> 03:29:11.892
MATT: "The Lady. If this sort of stuff's
happening, that's very not good."

03:29:11.892 --> 03:29:13.159
TRAVIS: Yeah, Zethriss--

03:29:13.159 --> 03:29:14.965
MARISHA: Zethriss Oreos?

03:29:15.165 --> 03:29:17.977
TALIESIN: I think that would be the neighborly
thing to do.

03:29:17.977 --> 03:29:19.808
TRAVIS: What's her name? Zethriss?

03:29:19.808 --> 03:29:21.798
MATT: "Lady Olios."

03:29:21.798 --> 03:29:23.241
TRAVIS: Olios.

03:29:23.241 --> 03:29:31.753
MATT: "Olios. I haven't met her. Otherwise I'd
tell her myself, but you know... I don't know,

03:29:31.753 --> 03:29:36.346
"them drow folk make me feel sort of
self-conscious, you know?"

03:29:40.526 --> 03:29:45.300
TALIESIN: That's surprising. You're very
impressive. I mean, I'm certainly charmed.

03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:48.796
MATT: Make a-- your choice, persuasion or
deception.

03:29:48.956 --> 03:29:54.432
TALIESIN: Oh, persuasion. 21.

03:29:54.952 --> 03:29:57.998
MATT: "Oh, stop. Oh, you're adorable."

03:29:57.998 --> 03:29:59.511
TALIESIN: You're great.

03:30:00.171 --> 03:30:07.613
MATT: "Well done! Great! Fantastic! Let me go look
at it!" He goes down and runs in the darkness

03:30:07.613 --> 03:30:13.487
below and you hear, (shouting) "Ah, god! Ah,
another one! Jeez, how many were there?"

03:30:13.877 --> 03:30:17.314
LAURA: There were three, but one of them is gone
because he was banished.

03:30:17.314 --> 03:30:20.127
SAM: We could lock him there and just take all--

03:30:20.127 --> 03:30:23.447
TALIESIN: Hey, hey, hey. We're making friends now.

03:30:23.447 --> 03:30:28.553
MATT: "That's amazing! You killed three of them!
Fantastic."

03:30:28.553 --> 03:30:33.590
LIAM: Additionally, there was a rift in the very
fabric of time and space down below and my sister

03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:35.054
here closed that.

03:30:35.214 --> 03:30:36.925
MATT: "That's amazing!"

03:30:36.925 --> 03:30:41.344
LAURA: So if you want to give us even more of a
discount because, you know, we saved you a lot

03:30:41.344 --> 03:30:42.596
trouble in the future--

03:30:42.596 --> 03:30:44.952
MATT: "We had a deal, no. But that's amazing!"

03:30:44.952 --> 03:30:47.238
MARISHA: You also had a serious rat infestation.

03:30:47.238 --> 03:30:50.916
MATT: "I know about the rats! I mean, that's half
what you feed these things."

03:30:50.916 --> 03:30:52.286
TALIESIN: Well, sorry, then.

03:30:52.286 --> 03:30:56.896
MARISHA: They were a little out of control. I feel
like you shouldn't leave scraps of food around.

03:30:56.896 --> 03:30:57.639
I don't know.

03:30:57.639 --> 03:31:01.770
LIAM: Also, we did not agree to close any kind of
rift to another dimension.

03:31:01.770 --> 03:31:04.103
MATT: "Oh, no, and that's so appreciative of me!"

03:31:04.103 --> 03:31:09.515
LIAM: I would hate for us to open it back up. So
since it was something outside of the deal we made--

03:31:10.605 --> 03:31:15.031
MATT: "Then maybe you should go talk to the Lady
and tell her the good deed you did, and maybe

03:31:15.031 --> 03:31:18.996
"she'll be, 'Thank you! You went and close a rift
for the town! Here's some money!'"

03:31:18.996 --> 03:31:22.753
TRAVIS: Let's get these steeds and move on.

03:31:22.753 --> 03:31:28.776
LAURA: I'm a very kind person. I don't mind
closing rifts for people in need, you know?

03:31:28.776 --> 03:31:30.460
MATT: "That's wonderful."

03:31:30.460 --> 03:31:37.629
MARISHA: Will you at least hold on to the jag--
the moorbound-- the swamp kitties for a little bit

03:31:37.629 --> 03:31:39.764
longer while we go talk to Lady Zethriss?

03:31:39.764 --> 03:31:41.764
MATT: "Yeah, I've still got to train you."

03:31:41.764 --> 03:31:42.813
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:31:42.813 --> 03:31:47.776
MATT: "I mean, I'm not just going to hand them
over. That's a recipe for disaster."

03:31:47.776 --> 03:31:52.568
MARISHA: Yeah. How'd you lose your arms? Was it
also in one of your seminars?

03:31:53.078 --> 03:31:59.023
MATT: "You know, when you're learning how to work
with these things, if you're not careful, bad

03:31:59.023 --> 03:32:04.890
"things happen. But you learn. Twice. But you know,
hasn't slowed me down!"

03:32:07.370 --> 03:32:12.779
MARISHA: I guess you can still straddle a swamp
kitty. All right, let's go!

03:32:12.779 --> 03:32:14.691
SAM: We're going to go see this woman?

03:32:14.921 --> 03:32:15.794
LAURA: Why?

03:32:16.294 --> 03:32:23.482
TALIESIN: I think this is an opportunity. To be
good neighbors. We're going to maybe need a few

03:32:23.482 --> 03:32:29.147
friends while we're out here, so let's try not to
be criminals and a criminal element too much.

03:32:29.147 --> 03:32:34.221
LIAM: Is it the kind of thing that we can do in under
an hour, or perhaps would wait until tomorrow?

03:32:36.341 --> 03:32:38.966
SAM: We're close by, right? It's that spire over
there?

03:32:39.596 --> 03:32:45.615
MATT: "Oh, yeah. That's maybe 12 minutes from
here, tops."

03:32:45.751 --> 03:32:47.787
TALIESIN: I say it's worth it, personally.

03:32:47.787 --> 03:32:49.605
MARISHA: Maybe she takes appointments.

03:32:49.605 --> 03:32:52.693
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, when we get there, she may
not even be home.

03:32:52.693 --> 03:32:55.363
SAM: When are we going to be in the City of Beasts
again?

03:32:55.363 --> 03:32:58.217
TALIESIN: At least let's file a report, like
proper citizens.

03:32:58.217 --> 03:32:59.116
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:32:59.116 --> 03:33:00.072
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:33:00.072 --> 03:33:01.448
TRAVIS: We'll be back.

03:33:01.448 --> 03:33:07.797
MATT: "All right, I'll be over here. I'm going to
start rounding up my three choice picks for you.

03:33:07.797 --> 03:33:11.026
"See which ones are the most spry and lively."

03:33:11.026 --> 03:33:15.637
LAURA: Get one that's really cute for me, okay?
Like, gothy, but cute at the same time.

03:33:15.637 --> 03:33:23.373
MATT: "For you? I'll do my best!" (giggles) He
escorts you guys to the outside of Zorth's Pits,

03:33:24.183 --> 03:33:29.649
closes the door behind you guys and you're now
standing in the center of the main street thoroughfare.

03:33:30.899 --> 03:33:35.094
TALIESIN: Let's head that way. It's always worth
making friends, no matter where you are.

03:33:35.744 --> 03:33:38.602
MARISHA: Do you think she's a mage or sorcerer or
something?

03:33:38.602 --> 03:33:39.840
TALIESIN: I have no idea.

03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:42.696
MARISHA: They keep calling her Lady and she lives
in a tower.

03:33:43.076 --> 03:33:47.758
TRAVIS: Well, listen, if y'all are worried those
of us that are under minimal changes-- we could

03:33:47.758 --> 03:33:48.668
let her know.

03:33:48.668 --> 03:33:50.417
LAURA: Fjord, yours is pretty major.

03:33:50.417 --> 03:33:51.973
TRAVIS: It is, isn't it?

03:33:53.623 --> 03:33:55.044
TALIESIN: I hadn't noticed.

03:33:55.074 --> 03:34:00.448
LIAM: You two don't need to do much of anything,
do you? You should talk to her, in case she's able

03:34:00.448 --> 03:34:01.988
to see through things.

03:34:03.418 --> 03:34:09.249
TALIESIN: I imagine that anybody who lives in this
city will understand the desire to be incognito.

03:34:09.959 --> 03:34:16.306
LIAM: I do not make that assumption, I would like
the horny one and the little green lady to talk to

03:34:16.306 --> 03:34:17.702
her, if that's okay.

03:34:18.292 --> 03:34:19.767
TALIESIN: Beau and Nott? Sure.

03:34:19.767 --> 03:34:21.206
LAURA: (laughs)

03:34:21.206 --> 03:34:22.544
TALIESIN: That was for you.

03:34:22.544 --> 03:34:23.816
LAURA: I liked it.

03:34:23.996 --> 03:34:25.001
SAM: Makes sense.

03:34:25.131 --> 03:34:26.254
LIAM: Just precautions.

03:34:26.274 --> 03:34:27.148
TRAVIS: Sure.

03:34:27.158 --> 03:34:30.899
LAURA: We're on it. We have this totally handled.

03:34:31.019 --> 03:34:32.389
LIAM: I believe in you.

03:34:33.649 --> 03:34:34.620
SAM: Let's go!

03:34:34.620 --> 03:34:37.022
MATT: All right. Is everyone going as a group?

03:34:37.022 --> 03:34:41.482
SAM: We'll walk over there as a group, but the
detectives will go in.

03:34:41.632 --> 03:34:50.601
MATT: You guys make your way through, pushing past
three major carts that are being pulled by aurochs

03:34:50.601 --> 03:34:58.289
that are currently in this large harness, pulling
them through the muck and mud. (aurochs lowing) On

03:34:58.289 --> 03:35:07.281
the back of it, you can see barrels of large
ballista ammunition. You can see heavy barrels

03:35:07.281 --> 03:35:15.553
containing three, four-foot-long metallic bolts
with hooked and jagged edges that are used for

03:35:15.553 --> 03:35:24.214
piercing and destroying boundaries and borders,
walls, doorways. Some are placed up and some are

03:35:24.214 --> 03:35:29.735
placed down, and they have large loops at the end.
Reminds you of harpoons, a bit.

03:35:29.735 --> 03:35:32.873
MARISHA: Are these human catchers? People
catchers?

03:35:32.873 --> 03:35:37.586
TALIESIN: I'm trying to remember the name. There's
a name, and it's somewhere in my brain right now.

03:35:37.586 --> 03:35:39.208
MARISHA: Spikes with a loop, yeah.

03:35:39.208 --> 03:35:45.459
MATT: You're not entirely certain. Actually, you,
being the learned one, make an intelligence check.

03:35:46.209 --> 03:35:52.483
MARISHA: Just straight intelligence? That was
almost fucking awesome. It's still okay. 14.

03:35:53.263 --> 03:35:58.597
MATT: You're not entirely certain the application
of these, but these are a different type of

03:35:58.597 --> 03:36:00.007
ballista ammunition.

03:36:01.087 --> 03:36:02.550
MARISHA: Interesting. Okay.

03:36:03.300 --> 03:36:05.875
TALIESIN: They don't know, but I did remember the
term.

03:36:05.875 --> 03:36:11.907
MATT: Passing by those carts as they're wheeled
southward towards the gate, you make your way to

03:36:11.907 --> 03:36:19.718
the outside of the Aurora... Hold. That's the word
I was looking for. As you approach now, it stands

03:36:19.718 --> 03:36:25.786
out like a sore thumb against the majority of the
architecture in the interior of Asarius. It

03:36:25.786 --> 03:36:34.063
almost resembles, in its design, a classic church
and steeple, where it has this gradual incline on

03:36:34.063 --> 03:36:39.655
the edges that come to a partial roof, and then
the central spire shoots up into this gradual

03:36:39.655 --> 03:36:45.468
point about three stories off the ground. Along
it, it's not smooth. The edges are ridged, and you

03:36:45.468 --> 03:36:51.813
can see intricate details where it has this
hooked-- in some ways similar to a pagoda, how it

03:36:51.813 --> 03:36:59.579
edges outward in these curves and points, where
the roofs come to a gentle end and slope. There

03:36:59.579 --> 03:37:05.354
are a number of beautiful, beautiful glass windows
that are stained glass, but as opposed to

03:37:05.354 --> 03:37:12.563
multicolor, it looks like a more muted palette of
grays and purples and silvers and blacks and

03:37:12.563 --> 03:37:17.859
blues. From the outside, it doesn't look as
gorgeous, but as you walk up to the front door,

03:37:17.859 --> 03:37:22.934
which is already open on the inside, what light
comes through fills the interior with this very

03:37:22.934 --> 03:37:38.301
calming, blue-purple color that has this strangely
welcoming and almost chilled atmosphere to it. As

03:37:38.308 --> 03:37:45.252
you approach, you see two Kryn soldiers walk by.
They step aside. They don't take note of you, but

03:37:45.252 --> 03:37:49.505
they move on, and both of them split as they reach
the center road and go in two different

03:37:49.505 --> 03:37:53.466
directions, heading north and south. What would
you like to do?

03:37:54.456 --> 03:37:55.370
SAM: Let's go in.

03:37:55.370 --> 03:37:57.033
LAURA: Yeah, we should go right in.

03:37:57.033 --> 03:37:58.810
SAM: We're just going to go in. Yeah.

03:37:58.810 --> 03:37:59.815
MATT: The two of you?

03:37:59.815 --> 03:38:01.370
SAM: Sure. Wait out here, y'all.

03:38:01.370 --> 03:38:02.388
TALIESIN: All right.

03:38:05.218 --> 03:38:06.909
SAM: Thanks for saving my life.

03:38:07.669 --> 03:38:14.964
MATT: As you guys patiently wait, the
investigatory team, you step to the base of the

03:38:14.964 --> 03:38:22.375
building, and up what's maybe five feet of stairs,
these wide, 15-foot wide stone stairs that lead to

03:38:22.375 --> 03:38:29.875
the main open doorway. Stepping into the initial
chamber, the light that fills the inside, it's

03:38:29.875 --> 03:38:36.745
beautiful. It's warmer on the inside, and there's
no desk, more than a set of chairs-- comfortable,

03:38:36.745 --> 03:38:43.615
well-made chairs, once again standing out against
most of the furniture and the living spaces you've

03:38:43.615 --> 03:38:48.934
already encountered, even in cursory glances
across the city. As you enter the chamber and look

03:38:48.934 --> 03:38:53.551
around, there are two doors, one to the right and
one to the left. They are both closed, and there

03:38:53.551 --> 03:38:56.745
does not appear to be anybody in the chamber at
the moment.

03:38:57.785 --> 03:38:59.997
SAM: Knock on some doors? Or is there a bell?

03:38:59.997 --> 03:39:01.696
LAURA: Do we see anybody?

03:39:01.696 --> 03:39:03.446
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:39:04.656 --> 03:39:05.637
SAM: 12.

03:39:08.357 --> 03:39:09.345
LAURA: 12.

03:39:09.875 --> 03:39:14.985
MATT: You both look and, to each side of the door,
there is a braided cord that hangs about ten feet

03:39:14.985 --> 03:39:19.106
from a bell, flanking each side of the door on the
inside.

03:39:19.106 --> 03:39:21.636
SAM: There's two different doors, two different
bells?

03:39:21.636 --> 03:39:22.554
MATT: Correct.

03:39:22.554 --> 03:39:24.336
LAURA: Shall we just ring them both?

03:39:24.336 --> 03:39:28.590
SAM: Any markings on--? (ringing)

03:39:28.590 --> 03:39:32.319
(laughter)

03:39:32.319 --> 03:39:33.216
TRAVIS: Amazing!

03:39:33.216 --> 03:39:43.417
MATT: A moment passes before one door opens up
and, stepping inside, you see a human, a man

03:39:43.417 --> 03:39:51.673
probably in his mid-forties or so, big, bushy
beard that falls down to his mid-chest, hair that

03:39:51.673 --> 03:39:58.303
is greased and slicked back into very tight
ponytail that then releases into a bunch of

03:39:58.303 --> 03:40:07.575
billowing curls that go to about his mid-back. He
is wearing dark gray-silver robes and bright,

03:40:07.575 --> 03:40:15.027
shiny, little pins that mark where the clavicle
and the shoulder meet. As he peeks through and

03:40:15.027 --> 03:40:25.697
goes, "Can I help you?", the other door opens, and
you see a drow girl, young, maybe late teens,

03:40:25.697 --> 03:40:32.865
early twenties. Bright silver-white hair that is
pulled into a high ponytail and then two tendrils

03:40:32.865 --> 03:40:40.966
that go past the front of the ears and dangle down
to about mid-chest. Beautiful, solid gray-blue

03:40:40.966 --> 03:40:47.827
skin, almost amber-colored eyes, as she peeks
through wearing a similar robe as to him, and

03:40:47.827 --> 03:40:50.117
goes, "Hello?"

03:40:51.267 --> 03:40:56.087
SAM: We're looking for Lady Zethriss. Is one of
you-- I don't want to presume.

03:40:56.307 --> 03:41:05.106
MATT: The man closes the door, and the girl walks
up. "If I might ask, what is the reason for the meet?"

03:41:06.076 --> 03:41:11.258
LAURA: The Sunbreaker told us to come over here,
because he said maybe that you guys had some work

03:41:11.258 --> 03:41:15.967
for us, but at the same time, we were supposed to
come tell you about this stuff that we found here.

03:41:15.967 --> 03:41:25.048
SAM: We're an investigative duo. We're known as
Django and Nash, and we go around finding things--

03:41:25.048 --> 03:41:26.525
LAURA: Really important things.

03:41:26.525 --> 03:41:29.315
SAM: We found something that you might be
interested in.

03:41:30.065 --> 03:41:33.352
MATT: "All right. Please wait patiently. I will
let the Lady know."

03:41:33.352 --> 03:41:34.747
SAM: Oh, you're not the Lady.

03:41:34.747 --> 03:41:37.685
MATT: "No." Closes the door.

03:41:37.975 --> 03:41:39.188
TRAVIS: Good pitch.

03:41:39.257 --> 03:41:42.784
SAM: I thought she was a lady. She <i>is</i> a lady.

03:41:42.784 --> 03:41:46.081
LAURA: Yeah. We're going to tell them of the rift,
right?

03:41:46.081 --> 03:41:49.024
SAM: If it suits our purposes.

03:41:49.024 --> 03:41:51.086
LAURA: What else are we going to tell them?

03:41:51.086 --> 03:41:52.425
SAM: I don't know, honestly.

03:41:52.425 --> 03:41:55.811
MATT: Eventually the door opens, and she returns
and goes, "Please, if you would not mind,

03:41:55.811 --> 03:41:56.796
"come with me."

03:41:57.015 --> 03:42:00.063
SAM: Sure. Yes, of course. We do this sort of
thing all the time.

03:42:00.063 --> 03:42:02.204
LAURA: Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. Insight check!

03:42:02.204 --> 03:42:03.543
MATT: Make an insight check.

03:42:03.543 --> 03:42:06.445
TRAVIS: Have you ever killed one-half of a table
before, Matt?

03:42:07.545 --> 03:42:08.280
MATT: Yeah.

03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:08.982
LAURA: 21.

03:42:09.702 --> 03:42:10.312
MATT: Okay.

03:42:10.726 --> 03:42:19.088
SAM: Oh! Oh! I'm going to die! We're going to die!
She's a monster in a girl's shell!

03:42:19.638 --> 03:42:26.179
TRAVIS: Guys, D&amp;D Beyond has a ferocious race for
president of D&amp;D heating up.

03:42:26.539 --> 03:42:29.778
SAM: The only way that you can vote is to
subscribe. That's not true.

03:42:29.778 --> 03:42:33.817
(laughter)

03:42:34.337 --> 03:42:35.387
MATT: You follow suit?

03:42:35.387 --> 03:42:36.307
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

03:42:36.917 --> 03:42:41.778
MATT: Leading you through the door, the next
chamber, it looks like there are two parallel

03:42:41.778 --> 03:42:48.217
hallways, because where would be the left, where
the other door had opened, there is a long, heavy

03:42:48.217 --> 03:42:53.799
stone wall that divides this. This chamber seems
to be divided into two sides. Heading down this

03:42:53.799 --> 03:42:59.392
way, you pass a closed door on the right, a second
closed door on the right, a third closed door on

03:42:59.392 --> 03:43:08.030
the right, and each door has a guard there. The
guards are wearing mantles that are similar to, or

03:43:08.030 --> 03:43:14.825
of the same design as, the Kryn armor and the
mantle you saw on the mage that you fought, when

03:43:14.825 --> 03:43:21.839
you first came to Xhorhas. It's just the mantle,
and it's adorning the simple silver-gray robes

03:43:21.839 --> 03:43:32.600
that the other figures in this building seem to be
wearing. The interior is beautiful. Whereas a

03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:37.760
somewhat plain exterior, aside from the general
shape and curvature of the edges of the building,

03:43:38.140 --> 03:43:45.650
the interior walls here have beautiful scrollwork
chiseled into all the stone. Each doorway frame

03:43:45.650 --> 03:43:53.686
has this ivy-type texture that curls and swirls
around the door frame. A lot of effort and work

03:43:53.686 --> 03:44:03.055
has gone into the construction of this building.
You go past the third door, and the woman goes and

03:44:03.055 --> 03:44:10.008
opens the chamber doorway, nods, and gives you a
nudge to enter.

03:44:12.628 --> 03:44:13.537
SAM: We do.

03:44:15.063 --> 03:44:24.410
MATT: You enter the room. The first thing you're
met with is two drow warriors, both adorned in

03:44:24.410 --> 03:44:33.529
armor, but the armor itself is clean, well-kept,
possibly ceremonial, or at least has not been used

03:44:33.529 --> 03:44:43.060
in battle for a while. They both look at you both
and step aside. Beyond that, you see a beautiful,

03:44:43.060 --> 03:44:52.218
tall, high-back lounge chair that extends out with
this deep reddish-purple hue, like a velvet. The

03:44:52.218 --> 03:44:58.882
rim on the outside that curls around it, also
beautifully done in a brass color that spirals on

03:44:58.882 --> 03:45:06.850
the edges. You can see a small altar in the center
of the chamber, about three feet from the foot of

03:45:06.850 --> 03:45:14.209
this, and this altar heads up in this slow,
gradual, spiralling point, almost like there were

03:45:14.209 --> 03:45:23.069
two paths of a tapering tower. At the top, you see
a brass dodecahedron.

03:45:25.089 --> 03:45:27.030
SAM: I look everywhere but at that.

03:45:27.030 --> 03:45:41.374
MATT: Hollow, there's nothing inside, but it's an
art piece. In the chair, sitting in incredible,

03:45:41.374 --> 03:45:49.020
detailed brocades inlaid into this silk robe that
drifts past her legs to the point where you cannot

03:45:49.020 --> 03:45:58.540
see her feet, dangling and rolling off the edge of
the chair, this beautiful dark elf woman, her skin

03:45:58.540 --> 03:46:07.790
a soft violet hue, her hair bright white that
seems to taper to a similar purple-violet color as

03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:12.670
to her skin as it goes past her shoulders. Her
hair is long. It goes past her hips, and tumbles

03:46:12.670 --> 03:46:20.596
off the edges of the chair. She sits towards the
edge of the chair, just looking her face towards

03:46:20.596 --> 03:46:28.239
this art piece, her eyes closed, and her hand
raises up and asks you to enter, silently.

03:46:31.760 --> 03:46:34.123
SAM: We'll just wait until she talks, I guess?

03:46:34.123 --> 03:46:37.421
LAURA: Yeah. She'll start the convo.

03:46:37.421 --> 03:46:38.925
MATT: She gestures for you.

03:46:38.925 --> 03:46:41.461
LAURA and SAM: Yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

03:46:42.111 --> 03:46:47.112
MATT: The two Kryn soldiers close the door and
stay there, watching. They're not leaving you

03:46:47.112 --> 03:46:57.129
alone in the chamber. Her eyes open and look
toward you, and her irises are a pure, vibrant

03:46:57.129 --> 03:47:03.911
amethyst purple. It's entrancing, even just to see
the color. Even in this low light, it almost seems

03:47:03.911 --> 03:47:14.251
to be backlit, the way the color comes at you. Her
face seems gentle and comes to a smile. "So I have

03:47:14.251 --> 03:47:18.185
"been told that you are investigators. Is this
correct?"

03:47:18.435 --> 03:47:20.900
LAURA: Yes, we're detectives.

03:47:22.190 --> 03:47:25.461
MATT: "You came at the behest of the Sunbreaker?"

03:47:25.891 --> 03:47:32.961
SAM: He told us about you. He didn't say, "You
must go there."

03:47:32.961 --> 03:47:37.671
LAURA: But he was like, "You should probably go
see her because she's pretty cool," and he wasn't

03:47:37.671 --> 03:47:39.720
lying, man! You are super cool.

03:47:41.940 --> 03:47:48.470
MATT: "Right. Well, are you coming seeking work?"

03:47:49.430 --> 03:47:57.061
SAM: Maybe. We were interested in possibly sharing
some information with you.

03:47:57.061 --> 03:47:59.978
LAURA: We found something that I think you would
like to know.

03:47:59.978 --> 03:48:01.450
MATT: "Please, do tell me."

03:48:02.600 --> 03:48:04.201
LAURA: I'm going to tell her.

03:48:04.201 --> 03:48:10.501
SAM: Yeah, sure, sure. We were on another case,
can't get into the details of it. Super hush-hush.

03:48:10.501 --> 03:48:18.654
We like to keep our client list private. But we were on
another case and we stumbled upon a bit of a rifty.

03:48:18.654 --> 03:48:22.963
LAURA: Yeah, it was like, you know, like a--

03:48:23.113 --> 03:48:25.636
SAM: A doorway to another dimension.

03:48:25.636 --> 03:48:31.571
LAURA: It was very flexible. It was another
dimension.

03:48:31.571 --> 03:48:42.911
SAM: It could expand to accept any shape that
wanted to enter it, but that wasn't the

03:48:42.911 --> 03:48:43.763
interesting part.

03:48:43.763 --> 03:48:45.513
LAURA: No, no, that was normal.

03:48:45.513 --> 03:48:53.732
SAM: The interesting part was that this passageway
let in creatures from another dimension. An evil

03:48:53.732 --> 03:48:58.711
dimension. Some call it the Abyss, or something.

03:48:58.711 --> 03:49:03.365
LAURA: They were definitely fiends, you know, that
came through. There were multiple ones and

03:49:03.365 --> 03:49:05.511
they were scary.

03:49:06.871 --> 03:49:08.493
SAM: Right in your home town here!

03:49:08.493 --> 03:49:10.767
LAURA: They were right here! Under the ground!

03:49:10.767 --> 03:49:18.492
SAM: A few hundred yards away from here! We were
like, "That's crazy." But right away, we were like,

03:49:18.492 --> 03:49:20.451
"We got to go tell Lady Z."

03:49:23.801 --> 03:49:46.503
MATT: "Zethriss. Thank you. And I'm impressed.
There has been a worrying rise in demonic activity

03:49:46.503 --> 03:49:57.471
"in the proximity of this town. There have been
words of lost sleep and bad dreams. There has been

03:49:57.471 --> 03:50:12.372
"talk of possible corruption of a fiendish nature.
The true difficulty is our resources are focused

03:50:12.372 --> 03:50:23.693
"to the west. We have found too many close
incursions across the Ashkeepers and we are

03:50:23.693 --> 03:50:32.321
"waylaid left and right. So it is fortunate you
have come to me because I have much interest in

03:50:32.321 --> 03:50:38.364
"talented minds. Especially those who are looking
to work for coin or trade."

03:50:39.884 --> 03:50:43.610
LAURA: Well, coin is pretty cool and stuff, and so
is some trade.

03:50:43.610 --> 03:50:48.498
MATT: "May I ask you, what are your specialities,
the two of you?"

03:50:50.858 --> 03:50:55.477
LAURA: I'm really good at healing people
and stuff.

03:50:57.197 --> 03:50:59.524
MATT: "That is good."

03:50:59.524 --> 03:51:08.813
LAURA: And I can also, you know-- I make a
duplicate of myself. I can also do that!

03:51:08.813 --> 03:51:10.422
SAM: She's a talented artist.

03:51:10.612 --> 03:51:15.294
LAURA: I draw. I could draw a portrait for you, if
you want me to.

03:51:15.294 --> 03:51:17.092
SAM: A tattoo artist-- budding.

03:51:17.262 --> 03:51:23.582
LAURA: Yes yes yes! Very talented tattoo artist.
If you are ever in need of a piece, let me know.

03:51:24.082 --> 03:51:25.984
I can be of service.

03:51:26.294 --> 03:51:31.366
SAM: I mean, these skills-- those would be at the
end of the resume, like special skills. I think that--

03:51:31.366 --> 03:51:32.773
TRAVIS: Horseback riding.

03:51:33.783 --> 03:51:35.646
LAURA: Like driving stick shift.

03:51:35.646 --> 03:51:41.927
SAM: Has driver's license. But I think the one she
wanted to lead with was, she's a healer.

03:51:41.927 --> 03:51:48.580
LAURA: I'm a healer, but I'm also, like, a badass
healer. You know, so I can hit things and heal at

03:51:48.580 --> 03:51:51.659
the same time. And then <i>you</i>.

03:51:51.929 --> 03:51:53.368
SAM: Fast as lightning.

03:51:53.368 --> 03:51:55.090
LAURA: Super drunk, sometimes.

03:51:55.090 --> 03:51:59.638
(laughter)

03:51:59.638 --> 03:52:08.822
SAM: Okay, that's lower. That's lower on the CV, high
tolerance. Fast as lightning, sneaky as a motherfuck!

03:52:08.822 --> 03:52:10.039
LAURA: And! And!

03:52:10.039 --> 03:52:12.449
SAM: Sharpshooter. (crossbow bolts whizzing)

03:52:12.449 --> 03:52:15.479
LAURA: Super, super good with arrows and bolts and
stuff.

03:52:15.479 --> 03:52:23.554
SAM: But together, we have some sort of-- I don't
know what it is, actually. We've never really

03:52:23.554 --> 03:52:32.059
talked about it. But we have this incredible mind
for solving conundrums. For getting to the root of

03:52:32.059 --> 03:52:37.369
the problem. Bad cop, good cop; good cop, bad cop,
whatever you want to call it, we are...

03:52:38.079 --> 03:52:39.470
we're a dynamic duo.

03:52:40.770 --> 03:52:52.411
MATT: She still smiles. There is a distinct
hardness behind the smile, and in that instant,

03:52:52.411 --> 03:53:02.831
for a brief moment, being as relatively insightful
as you are, Jester, there is a thinning patience.

03:53:04.328 --> 03:53:15.194
But she says, "Well. And you have-- this rift that
you mentioned. These fiendish things, did you just

03:53:15.194 --> 03:53:18.624
discover them? Or have you dealt with them?"

03:53:18.624 --> 03:53:23.615
LAURA: Oh, we dealt with them! They are dead and
gone and (snaps) banished and also the rift is closed.

03:53:24.305 --> 03:53:26.075
MATT: "And it's just the two of you?"

03:53:26.495 --> 03:53:28.426
SAM: We have some coworkers.

03:53:28.426 --> 03:53:30.475
LAURA: Some other people that work with us.

03:53:30.475 --> 03:53:36.958
MATT: "Well. That makes a lot more sense." Okay,
make a persuasion check. Either both of you

03:53:36.958 --> 03:53:39.676
together, or one of you with advantage.
Your choice.

03:53:40.138 --> 03:53:41.610
LAURA and SAM: Both of us.

03:53:44.954 --> 03:53:46.213
LAURA: Woo!

03:53:46.213 --> 03:53:47.976
SAM: Dueling 18s!

03:53:49.936 --> 03:53:51.129
LAURA: 22 for me.

03:53:51.129 --> 03:53:53.093
SAM: What is it, deception or persuasion?

03:53:53.093 --> 03:53:53.971
LAURA: Persuasion.

03:53:53.971 --> 03:53:55.262
SAM: Just straight 18.

03:53:55.662 --> 03:54:04.339
MATT: Okay! Interestingly enough, that impatience
and hardness that has been growing subsides. She

03:54:04.339 --> 03:54:09.841
began to lean forward in kind of an, "I'm going to
deconstruct these people," type of energy;

03:54:09.841 --> 03:54:16.028
something that you've encountered before. And then
a few things you said, and the way that you

03:54:16.028 --> 03:54:22.238
explained it away, she began to feel a little more
comfortable. "Well, we can use all the help we can

03:54:22.238 --> 03:54:32.840
"get. There are two things that come to mind at the
moment, if you are interested in helping. For one,

03:54:35.410 --> 03:54:46.839
"I have come to believe there is an Empire spy in
our midst, living here, in Asarius. Possibly, if my

03:54:46.839 --> 03:54:57.994
"information is correct, working or staying near the
Four Corners. An intercepted missive out of the

03:54:57.994 --> 03:55:04.612
"city from this individual was shot down, being sent
by nighthawk. And the messenger was seen leaving

03:55:04.612 --> 03:55:13.249
"the Four Corners. This missive was giving information
about the movement of our forces, preparations

03:55:13.249 --> 03:55:25.788
"and such, to the Empire. It was being sent to
Bladegarden. If you can suss out this spy and turn

03:55:25.788 --> 03:55:37.469
"them in to me, you will be rewarded greatly. Bring
them alive, I'll leave you with 5,000 gold pieces."

03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:38.989
(gasping)

03:55:38.989 --> 03:55:40.803
MARISHA: I'm so broke; we're so broke.

03:55:41.493 --> 03:55:51.609
MATT: "3,000 if dead, with proof. If that does not
suit your fancy, or your particular skill set of

03:55:51.609 --> 03:56:02.272
"investigation, you seem to already be somewhat
tangled with this demonic presence. There have

03:56:02.272 --> 03:56:10.384
"been some strange murders in the city. Some locals
going mad or... feral is becoming a growing issue.

03:56:10.564 --> 03:56:20.358
"And I have suspicions that it is connected with
this demonic presence. (sigh) Focusing on the war

03:56:20.358 --> 03:56:26.693
"efforts, I am unable to allocate many resources to
this, so you would be of great help. If you could

03:56:26.693 --> 03:56:35.901
"find the root of this corruption, wherever it
stems from, and snuff it out, freeing Asarius

03:56:35.901 --> 03:56:44.307
"from this infernal influence, the Dynasty is
willing to pay 10,000 gold pieces."

03:56:50.217 --> 03:56:52.331
LAURA: That's a good amount of money.

03:56:52.336 --> 03:56:56.125
SAM: Mm-hmm, that's good. Money is good, money is
good. We--

03:56:56.665 --> 03:57:02.280
MATT: "If money is not interesting to you, we
could always trade with favor to the Bright Queen."

03:57:05.660 --> 03:57:10.843
SAM: That is actually, possibly even more
appealing than money, maybe?

03:57:10.843 --> 03:57:12.894
LAURA: (whispering) Who's the Bright Queen?

03:57:12.894 --> 03:57:16.865
LAURA and SAM: (whispers and confused muttering)

03:57:16.945 --> 03:57:28.409
SAM: We may have need of that. There is an ally of
ours who we've been trying to ascertain their

03:57:28.409 --> 03:57:32.806
whereabouts, and maybe through favor,
you could help us.

03:57:32.806 --> 03:57:36.470
MATT: She leans forward and goes, "Are either of
you consecuted?"

03:57:37.300 --> 03:57:38.591
SAM: Consecuted?

03:57:41.491 --> 03:57:42.554
MATT: "Understood."

03:57:45.799 --> 03:57:50.122
SAM: I've never heard that word before. Is that a
made-up word? Is that a Scrabble word?

03:57:52.072 --> 03:58:01.454
MATT: She got all she wanted from that. She goes,
"Well, if you seek the Bright Queen's favor, I

03:58:01.454 --> 03:58:10.071
"just assumed you were perhaps of the houses of
Ghor Dranas. My apologies. But the coin remains,

03:58:12.221 --> 03:58:21.523
"and perhaps a favor or a trade. But these are
conversations to have when you have succeeded."

03:58:21.713 --> 03:58:27.141
LAURA: Right. Do you know where we would start
with the stuff, and stuff?

03:58:27.611 --> 03:58:31.465
SAM: The demons, the demonic presence, any leads?
Any hot tips?

03:58:31.465 --> 03:58:35.680
MATT: "That is precisely why we would be hiring an
investigator."

03:58:36.580 --> 03:58:37.902
SAM: Yeah, we know that.

03:58:37.912 --> 03:58:41.798
LAURA: Yeah, we know where to start because, you
know what, we just came from something so we'll

03:58:41.798 --> 03:58:42.967
just follow that trail.

03:58:42.967 --> 03:58:43.815
SAM: Totally.

03:58:43.815 --> 03:58:44.651
LAURA: Yep.

03:58:45.271 --> 03:58:51.114
MATT: "I look forward to the completion of any or
all of your missions."

03:58:51.424 --> 03:58:53.092
LAURA: So do we.

03:58:53.092 --> 03:58:54.717
MATT: "May the light be with you."

03:58:54.827 --> 03:58:56.385
LAURA: And also with you.

03:58:57.355 --> 03:59:03.052
MATT: The door opens behind, the soldiers are
holding the door and kind of looking at you expectantly.

03:59:04.202 --> 03:59:06.193
LAURA: Okay. Well, we should go then.

03:59:06.193 --> 03:59:08.678
SAM: All right. See you soon, then.

03:59:09.178 --> 03:59:10.472
LAURA and SAM: Bye!

03:59:10.822 --> 03:59:20.856
MATT: "Bye." You guys are quickly escorted back
outside of the hall. As you guys are sitting there

03:59:20.856 --> 03:59:28.704
waiting nervously for a while, eventually you see
two Kryn warriors gently nudging both Nott and

03:59:28.704 --> 03:59:30.025
Jester outside.

03:59:30.025 --> 03:59:37.528
SAM: As we left, I just quickly rang the other one
one more time and just kept going out.

03:59:37.528 --> 03:59:41.275
MATT: You hear, "Hello?", as you just walk away.

03:59:43.345 --> 03:59:48.611
SAM: Okay. So you sent in the right people for
that job!

03:59:48.611 --> 03:59:50.792
LAURA: (ptchoo, ptchoo, ptchoo!)

03:59:51.572 --> 03:59:59.082
SAM: We have two assignments that have nothing to
do with saving my husband. But maybe if we did

03:59:59.082 --> 04:00:02.891
one, she might be able to help us. Maybe?

04:00:02.891 --> 04:00:04.082
LAURA: That's a hard one.

04:00:04.082 --> 04:00:09.811
SAM: I don't know. Here's the thing: we have these
three beasts now. We could go charging across the

04:00:09.811 --> 04:00:17.682
badlands to Ghor Dranas, right? And search around
for my husband, which I really want to do;

04:00:18.152 --> 04:00:19.164
don't get me wrong.

04:00:19.164 --> 04:00:20.973
TRAVIS: Unless that minotaur's around.

04:00:20.973 --> 04:00:31.643
SAM: (exhales) I mean, did you see his pecs? They
were not fake, like yours. Anyway. We could do

04:00:31.643 --> 04:00:39.644
that, but it's a lot of unknowns, right? This lady
could give us... something. I don't know.

04:00:39.644 --> 04:00:42.213
TRAVIS: Did she sound connected with Ghor Dranas?

04:00:42.883 --> 04:00:47.633
LAURA: Well, yeah. I mean, she's high up here, you
know. So she could definitely get some shit done.

04:00:47.633 --> 04:00:51.614
SAM: She said that she could curry favor with the
Bright Queen?

04:00:51.614 --> 04:00:52.857
LAURA: Which is the queen!

04:00:52.857 --> 04:00:53.953
SAM: Is that the queen?

04:00:53.953 --> 04:00:55.482
LIAM: They have an Empress here.

04:00:55.482 --> 04:00:57.734
LAURA: That's what I'm talking about. It's her!

04:00:57.734 --> 04:01:04.847
LIAM: I don't understand all the terminology, but
she is referred to as a word: an umavi? I don't

04:01:04.847 --> 04:01:08.057
know what that is, but I noticed that your
boyfriend said he was--

04:01:08.057 --> 04:01:11.255
SAM: He said, "I'm almost an umavi ascended" or
something like that.

04:01:11.255 --> 04:01:12.777
MARISHA: A near-umavi ascension?

04:01:12.777 --> 04:01:13.939
LIAM: Umavi, yeah.

04:01:14.029 --> 04:01:16.997
SAM: So she's called <i>an</i> umavi or <i>the</i> umavi?

04:01:16.997 --> 04:01:22.415
LIAM: I think she's called <i>the</i> umavi? I don't
know. It was vague.

04:01:22.415 --> 04:01:24.824
LAURA: Something about umavi, for sure, though.

04:01:24.824 --> 04:01:28.026
LIAM: It refers to the Empress, Leylas Kryn.

04:01:28.026 --> 04:01:31.967
SAM: Have you ever heard the term "consecuted"?

04:01:32.587 --> 04:01:34.194
LIAM: That's not a word, is it...

04:01:34.194 --> 04:01:36.767
SAM: No, it doesn't seem like the word. But she
said--

04:01:36.767 --> 04:01:41.328
LAURA: She said that it sounded like it had something
to do with the high up houses or something.

04:01:41.328 --> 04:01:42.766
SAM: Yeah. Are you consecuted?

04:01:42.766 --> 04:01:50.659
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure consecuted means you're
of a royal or a proper family? Would I know that?

04:01:52.119 --> 04:01:53.815
MATT: Make a history check.

04:01:53.815 --> 04:01:57.439
TALIESIN: I might know that, too. I feel like that
might be in my wheelhouse.

04:01:57.439 --> 04:01:59.258
MATT: Go for it. Make a history check.

04:02:01.168 --> 04:02:05.317
TALIESIN: No. That's a one minus one.

04:02:05.317 --> 04:02:07.485
MARISHA: Not great for me, either: eight.

04:02:07.485 --> 04:02:08.536
TRAVIS: I've got this.

04:02:09.976 --> 04:02:17.692
SAM: Oh yeah! No, I wrote it down here: "Empress
Leylas Kryn, 'umavi,' 600 years old." That's what

04:02:17.692 --> 04:02:22.677
I wrote down. I don't know what that means. But I
put it in quotes, like that's what she's called, right?

04:02:22.677 --> 04:02:24.833
TALIESIN: 600 years old is what she's called?

04:02:24.833 --> 04:02:25.593
SAM: No!

04:02:27.863 --> 04:02:31.841
MATT: None of you guys have any idea of what
consecuted refers to.

04:02:35.361 --> 04:02:37.086
LAURA: We just have to ask somebody.

04:02:37.156 --> 04:02:42.701
TALIESIN: Well, I also think that maybe getting a
little preparation before we head deeper into this

04:02:42.701 --> 04:02:48.112
place might not be a terrible idea, and having a
couple friends before we start--

04:02:48.942 --> 04:02:52.818
SAM: I mean, I'm all for charging ahead and
leaving this town, but I just don't know what

04:02:52.818 --> 04:02:53.872
we're heading towards.

04:02:53.872 --> 04:02:58.547
LIAM: Well, in the short term, we need to learn
how to ride those beasts. We could have-- Jester,

04:02:58.547 --> 04:03:01.147
you could check in with Yeza.

04:03:01.917 --> 04:03:10.260
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, the tasks she set for us are
not super easy, I don't think.

04:03:10.920 --> 04:03:14.397
SAM: Task one was to find a spy from the Empire.

04:03:14.397 --> 04:03:18.467
LAURA: Yeah. There's some dickhead Empire person
that's, like, a spy.

04:03:18.887 --> 04:03:20.059
MARISHA: Interesting.

04:03:20.059 --> 04:03:21.871
LIAM: And did they give you any leads?

04:03:21.871 --> 04:03:23.487
LAURA: Nope. Oh, the Four Corners.

04:03:23.487 --> 04:03:28.425
SAM: Yes, she said that they were transmitting
signals from the Four Corners-- or messages from

04:03:28.425 --> 04:03:36.811
the Four Corners. 5,000 gold if we find he or
she alive. Then the other was to find more of

04:03:36.811 --> 04:03:45.758
those rifts, the source of them. Put it out,
10,000 gold. Or one super-hot favor.

04:03:46.088 --> 04:03:49.818
MARISHA: Well, the source of them could be in a
whole other plane or dimension.

04:03:50.228 --> 04:03:52.180
SAM: She seemed to think that it was here.

04:03:53.460 --> 04:03:59.399
LIAM: This all sounds very time intensive. We
should check in with your husband.

04:04:00.719 --> 04:04:04.745
MARISHA: I'm a little interested in who the spy
is. I mean, it could be a bit of a conflict of

04:04:04.745 --> 04:04:07.477
interest, because I feel like we're spies
from the Empire.

04:04:07.477 --> 04:04:09.101
SAM: We don't work for the Empire.

04:04:09.101 --> 04:04:13.443
LAURA: (aggressively whispering) Shh. Don't say
that! Shut up! Don't say that shit out loud.

04:04:13.443 --> 04:04:18.155
TRAVIS: Well, listen. We've got to go to rest for
the evening anyway. There's only going to be three

04:04:18.165 --> 04:04:22.553
of us that are taking these seminar classes on how
to ride the shadow panther maniacs, right?

04:04:22.553 --> 04:04:26.546
TALIESIN: I think it might be wise for-- well, I
don't know-- for everybody to learn.

04:04:26.546 --> 04:04:31.728
LAURA: He just rolled. He just rolled to see if
they heard you talking about that. I know he did.

04:04:31.728 --> 04:04:32.983
He was rolling perception.

04:04:32.983 --> 04:04:34.557
MATT: What are you talking about?

04:04:34.557 --> 04:04:36.417
LAURA: (angry growling)

04:04:36.417 --> 04:04:38.253
MARISHA: I was speaking <i>hushedly</i>.

04:04:40.333 --> 04:04:43.918
TRAVIS: You know what? Why don't we just take this
out of the city for now?

04:04:46.408 --> 04:04:48.679
SAM: Wait. Leave the city to go to sleep?

04:04:48.679 --> 04:04:53.194
TRAVIS: And to talk about this a bit more, yeah.
Because if we're coming back in to take seminar

04:04:53.194 --> 04:04:56.687
classes, maybe half the group could go check out
the Four Corners.

04:04:56.687 --> 04:04:58.358
MARISHA: Fuck, that's a good point.

04:04:58.358 --> 04:05:01.689
TRAVIS: Otherwise, we're just sitting in daycare,
you know what I mean?

04:05:01.689 --> 04:05:07.229
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea, actually. I'm not
normally a fan of splitting people up, but that's clever.

04:05:07.229 --> 04:05:10.464
LAURA: Let's go to sleep though, because it's been
a really long day.

04:05:10.464 --> 04:05:11.750
TALIESIN: Yeah, I am tired.

04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:14.540
MARISHA: We are going to try and sleep in the city
or outside the city?

04:05:14.540 --> 04:05:15.336
TRAVIS: Out.

04:05:15.336 --> 04:05:16.250
MARISHA: All right.

04:05:16.250 --> 04:05:17.160
TALIESIN: Yes, sir.

04:05:17.160 --> 04:05:18.407
MARISHA: Make our way out.

04:05:18.407 --> 04:05:24.438
LAURA: But we stop by Zorth's place and just let
him know to keep hanging on to our little guys and

04:05:24.438 --> 04:05:25.913
we'll come and get them.

04:05:25.933 --> 04:05:30.627
MATT: "Yeah, no worries! Just come on by whenever!
They're right here waiting-- shut up! Beat 'em!

04:05:31.657 --> 04:05:37.450
"They'll be right here. I, er-- I've got to go!
I'll see you later!" Heads on back to join the

04:05:37.450 --> 04:05:42.111
rest of the goblin crew that are-- it looks like
one of them is starting to buck and get angry, and

04:05:42.111 --> 04:05:49.853
they're holding it down with ropes. It's going to be
some interesting purchases. But you gather your things--

04:05:49.853 --> 04:05:52.280
SAM: All right, we'll make our way
outside the city.

04:05:52.280 --> 04:05:53.378
LIAM: Let's go camping.

04:05:53.378 --> 04:05:57.200
MATT: You exit the city. You find yourself a
comfortable place on the outskirts, which is not

04:05:57.200 --> 04:06:03.017
too hard. There are actually a number of tents on
the outside of the city where some folks just

04:06:03.017 --> 04:06:08.198
don't have spaces inside Asarius to find home, or
some folks that prefer to sleep out under the

04:06:08.198 --> 04:06:12.825
stars. There are a number of campsites ahead out
there, especially over by where the large portion

04:06:12.825 --> 04:06:19.594
of the army is set. You can see a number of fires
and light systems. The sun eventually crests for

04:06:19.594 --> 04:06:24.840
the day where all the soldiers are scattered and still
preparing for whatever movement is ahead of them.

04:06:24.840 --> 04:06:28.311
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep an eye on the skies
for birds.

04:06:28.311 --> 04:06:36.791
MATT: Okay. As you guys are preparing and dusk
sets in, you do see one of those large beasts

04:06:36.791 --> 04:06:43.439
looming towards the city, just naturally wandering
in that direction, and begins to gain some speed

04:06:43.439 --> 04:06:50.140
(booming footsteps) towards the edge. You hear a
horn go (ascending call) and another one

04:06:50.140 --> 04:06:55.713
(lower-pitched answer) off behind it, and you see
a few soldiers come rushing out on that end of the

04:06:55.713 --> 04:07:03.088
gate as this huge beast is looming towards it. It
gets close, and then suddenly skids to a stop and

04:07:03.088 --> 04:07:08.288
turns around and bolts the opposite direction.
They repel it, though you are not certain of the

04:07:08.288 --> 04:07:15.180
means or use. It runs the opposite way for about a
quarter mile, and just stops and sits there. You

04:07:15.180 --> 04:07:20.311
watch and it slowly begins to mosey northward,
away from the city.

04:07:20.311 --> 04:07:22.380
TRAVIS: No flashes? No lights? No--?

04:07:22.380 --> 04:07:23.189
MATT: No.

04:07:23.519 --> 04:07:24.670
TALIESIN: Interesting.

04:07:25.460 --> 04:07:32.288
MATT: But you bed down for the evening; gather
your thoughts, gather your abilities, and think

04:07:32.288 --> 04:07:38.251
amongst yourselves what the next proper plan of
action is before you're about to enter day two on

04:07:38.251 --> 04:07:43.519
the outskirts of the City of Beasts. And that's where
we'll end tonight's session. Pick up there next week.

04:07:43.519 --> 04:07:45.518
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Yeah! City of Beasts!

04:07:45.518 --> 04:07:46.544
LIAM: Amazing.

04:07:46.544 --> 04:07:48.768
SAM: Matt. So good.

04:07:48.778 --> 04:07:53.048
MATT: I'm excited. It's a very different vibe from
where you started.

04:07:53.368 --> 04:07:54.340
MARISHA: Yes!

04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:57.780
TRAVIS: I'm a fan. I'm a fan!

04:07:57.780 --> 04:07:59.360
TALIESIN: Let's update that iPad.

04:07:59.390 --> 04:08:00.768
TRAVIS: We need a new tablet.

04:08:00.768 --> 04:08:02.910
MATT: Yeah, you do. We'll get everyone fixed.

04:08:02.910 --> 04:08:04.906
TALIESIN: Just start the updates now.

04:08:06.096 --> 04:08:07.179
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

04:08:07.369 --> 04:08:14.870
MATT: Well, thank you guys for tuning in. Don't
forget tomorrow, here at the Twitch channel at 7pm

04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:19.768
is our Search for Grog one-shot. Make sure to see
that: 7pm Pacific.

04:08:19.768 --> 04:08:21.190
MARISHA: Event of the season!

04:08:21.190 --> 04:08:27.508
MATT: Indeed, and we'll see you next Thursday.
But, guys: thank you so much for joining us;

04:08:27.508 --> 04:08:31.029
we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?
Good night.

04:08:31.029 --> 04:08:33.730
(cheering)

04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:48.941

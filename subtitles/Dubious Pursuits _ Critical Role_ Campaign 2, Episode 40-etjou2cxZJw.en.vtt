00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.288
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.478 --> 00:00:09.110
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. I know it's November 1st and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.473
Halloween was last night, but that's bullshit
because we would have missed Halloween, so we're

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:15.649
doing it anyway.

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.282
TRAVIS: Yeah! Halloween's when you want it to be!

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:24.422
MATT: Apparently I have a type when it comes to
Halloween costumes, but after having enough people

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:28.371
send me pictures of new Dante, going, "He looks
like you!" I was like, "Fuck it. I'm going to

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:35.977
"embrace it." So yes, I guess we'll go around and
introduce our costumes, because it sounds like fun

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:45.626
right now. I'm Dante from Devil May Cry 5. The
best I could do in one week's time, most of which

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:48.495
was spent in London. What about you?

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:53.950
TALIESIN: I'm Sherlock Holmes, because that's the
best I could do in two hours' time, after figuring

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.327
out that I was supposed to do this while working
on another project.

00:00:57.327 --> 00:00:59.103
SAM: I am ketchup.

00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:04.267
(laughter)

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.497
TRAVIS: Wasn't there face paint that could help
complete the look?

00:01:06.497 --> 00:01:09.796
SAM: Nope, this is it. Nine dollars.

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:11.373
MATT: Liam.

00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:16.780
LIAM: (as Mickey Mouse) Ha ha. I'm Kylo Ren. Ha
ha.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.048
MATT: Perfect!

00:01:18.048 --> 00:01:20.560
LIAM: (as Mickey Mouse) Ooh! Sorry, dad.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.749
MARISHA: I'm Lisa Frank Castle.

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.674
TALIESIN: By far the most put-together costume at
this table.

00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:29.597
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:31.285
MATT: And Travis.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.155
TRAVIS: I'm the bargain bin. I had a cowboy hat.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:36.611
SAM: I gave you some gloves.

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:39.517
TRAVIS: I think these belong to an M&amp;amp;M character?

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:41.639
SAM: Yeah, or Pac-man. I'm not sure.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:42.940
TRAVIS: Ey!

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.507
(laughter)

00:01:44.507 --> 00:01:46.255
MARISHA: You look like you're trying to sell baked
beans.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.946
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was a panda last night. I didn't
have a fucking costume. I wasn't wearing that

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.435
again. That shit was hot.

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:58.794
MATT: Perfect. Sadly, we're missing Laura Bailey
tonight. She is off doing rehearsals for BlizzCon

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.048
tomorrow. I will be there as well both days, so
those who are watching or are on the virtual

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:10.046
ticket, check it out, because there's some fun
stuff going on. Before we get into the rest of our

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:13.852
announcements, first we have two fantastic
sponsors tonight. The first of which is the

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.105
fantastic Tor Books. Liam!

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:26.379
LIAM: (air hissing) (as Kylo Ren) I have come from
a galaxy very far away to talk to you about Tor

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.980
Books. Tor Books is America's largest--

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.398
(laughter)

00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:41.517
LIAM: This is serious. Largest publisher of
science fiction and fantasy. From Tor Books comes

00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:49.402
Oathbringer, book three of The Stormlight
Archives. Humanity faces a new desolation with the

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:57.581
return of the Voidbringers, Matthew. A foe with
numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.

00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:03.547
Find Oathbringer out now in paperback wherever
books are sold. For more of the latest science

00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:15.575
fiction and fantasy releases, follow @torbooks.
That's T-O-R Books. I'm going to resume doing

00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:22.949
unspeakable things. (air hissing) Tor Books.

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.317
MATT: Kylo Walken?

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:28.367
SAM: I think that was Jackie Mason.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:33.912
LIAM: Listen to him again, he has a very subtle
Brooklyn accent always.

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:37.858
MATT: You actually directed him, so you would
know.

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:40.096
LIAM: I did one time, yes.

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:41.541
MATT: Anyway.

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:44.064
(laughter)

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:48.075
LIAM: He was great! It was a great project! I love
Star Wars! I'm dressed as him!

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.160
(laughter)

00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:57.318
MATT: Thank you, Liam. Our fantastic returning
second sponsor for tonight are our friends at D&amp;amp;D

00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:58.742
Beyond. Sam.

00:03:58.742 --> 00:04:04.873
SAM: If you have somehow still not checked out D&amp;amp;D
Beyond, it is the official digital toolset for

00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:09.706
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Everything is there at your
fingertips: the source books, the digital

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:17.044
character sheets, the homebrew content creation!
Go to dndbeyond.com now to check out how easy they

00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:24.270
make playing D&amp;amp;D. Now, you guys all know that
first and foremost, I am a filmmaker, and I am

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.304
proud to announce that tonight I have teamed with
D&amp;amp;D Beyond to create my first ever foray into

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:39.417
stop-motion animation. I don't want to say it's
better than The Nightmare Before Christmas, but

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:45.721
I'll let you guys say that. Wait until you see it
for yourself. Let's roll my film.

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:47.808
MATT: Oh my god, what have you done?!

00:04:47.808 --> 00:05:14.894
SAM (VO): (triumphant humming)

00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:19.204
(laughter)

00:05:19.204 --> 00:05:31.310
SAM: Thank you. Any film like this is a
collaborative process. I have so many people I

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.060
want to thank. I'll try to keep it quick. Our
cinematographer Giuseppe Fister, wonderful work,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.321
powerful work. Our gaffer Blumpkin Styles, the
most daring in the biz. Our sound mixer Randy

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:47.714
Cockburn, didn't think you could pull it off like
that. Best boy Mike Litoris, I can't believe I

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:54.569
found you. Our producer Willy Stroker, you've got
a finger on the pulse, sir. Casting director Ima

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.556
Dumas, and of course my agents at CAA, Amanda
Hump, Keifer Comings, Dickson Beavers, Harry

00:06:01.556 --> 00:06:08.991
Sacks, Otto Beemakraken, Wilma Fingerdo, Irma
Wanker, Drew P. Winer-- oh, I'm sorry, Drew P.

00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:16.758
Wiener, thank you all for believing in this
project. Also, my inspiration, my mentor, Hugh

00:06:16.758 --> 00:06:24.426
Janus, Mr. Janus, wherever he is. I think Hugh
Janus is smiling down on all of us tonight. And of

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:31.492
course, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, we did it guys! It took three
years, but we did it. Thank you.

00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:38.935
MATT: Well done. Thank you, Sam, and thank you,
our friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond, for making this happen

00:06:38.935 --> 00:06:40.947
on a weekly basis.

00:06:40.947 --> 00:06:43.586
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were at a Halloween party
yesterday. How did you have time for that?

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:46.016
MARISHA: I know. We were in London two days ago.

00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:47.904
TRAVIS: Three years it's been in the works.

00:06:47.904 --> 00:06:50.356
SAM: Yeah, it's been in post for months.

00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:57.098
MATT: I'm so glad that Dreamworks was willing to
work with you based on how much Disney you do.

00:06:57.098 --> 00:07:05.839
TALIESIN: Yeah. Also, I forgot I just announced
I'm going to be at Loscon November 23rd through

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:11.454
25th. So if you're in LA and want to check out the
convention, I'll be hanging out there and talking

00:07:11.454 --> 00:07:18.386
about D&amp;amp;D and voiceover and all sorts of things
like that. Loscon: L-O-S-C-O-N. That's what I've got.

00:07:18.386 --> 00:07:25.961
MATT: Find Taliesin there. Our final episode of
this batch of Between the Sheets aired this past

00:07:26.222 --> 00:07:33.208
Monday and is now available on YouTube, where our
fantastic host Brian W. Foster talks to me. It's a

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:42.834
bit of an emotional one, but I hope you enjoy it.
Check it out on youtube.com/criticalrole and I

00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:47.810
think that ends this batch. We'll be back very
soon with the next batch of new guests and new

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.663
stories with our fantastic host.

00:07:49.663 --> 00:07:55.362
SAM: It was really good, Matt. You did a great
job. I watched it on the cab ride home from the airport.

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:56.381
MATT: Oh shit, thank you.

00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:58.257
SAM: It was so good. Amazing.

00:07:58.257 --> 00:08:02.441
MATT: Thank you. I didn't expect it to get as deep
as it did but here we are. Anyway, hope you enjoy

00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:09.305
it. The next episode of All Work, No Play will
debut this Friday at twitch.tv/criticalrole at

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.098
7PM Pacific Time. This week, Liam and Sam learn how
to fire spin with our fantastic, our own, my wife,

00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:17.212
Marisha Ray.

00:08:17.212 --> 00:08:18.572
SAM: Yay!

00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:21.113
TRAVIS: You survived, clearly. Somehow.

00:08:21.113 --> 00:08:22.801
LIAM: Oh, the burn.

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.440
SAM: You were great, Marisha.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.601
MARISHA: It was fun. I was honored.

00:08:27.601 --> 00:08:32.055
MATT: I'm excited to see it. I've only seen bits
and pieces, and it's pretty absurd.

00:08:32.055 --> 00:08:33.652
SAM: Your wife shines.

00:08:33.652 --> 00:08:35.497
LIAM: But only from the fire burns.

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:37.899
MARISHA: I was going to say, it was from the
flames.

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:41.583
MATT: Yeah, failure to ignite. Check it out this
Friday at 7PM Pacific. Travis, you have something

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:42.461
to talk about?

00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:46.824
TRAVIS: Yes! Through the month of November, we are
raising money for my favorite charity: Operation

00:08:46.824 --> 00:08:55.328
Supply Drop! They are amazing. OSD has helped over
750,000 members of the military community with

00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:59.771
supply drops. They have initiatives, they have job
training, they have skill workshops for people

00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:05.244
that are going from active military work through
their transition into civilian life, and they just

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:10.819
touched so many people. I love this organization.
I've been following them for years. If we hit our

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:20.250
25,000 dollar goal, we're going to host a special
first-person shooter stream with me! Yeah. I used

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:26.027
to be good. I'm not so much anymore since baby
days, but I'm going to try. I'm going to have a

00:09:26.027 --> 00:09:26.780
montage.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.533
LIAM: Deep down that rabbit hole for years. Oh my
god. I liked playing with you. Never won, but I

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:32.513
enjoyed the process.

00:09:32.513 --> 00:09:36.059
TRAVIS: Thank you! Right? It's all about the
commentary that happens, right? If we hit that

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:43.168
goal we will do that. Details and to donate, you
can see everything at critrole.com/osd.

00:09:43.168 --> 00:09:45.627
LIAM: Amazing.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:52.368
MATT: Thanks, Travis. Daylight savings time hits
the US this week, so make sure for those that are

00:09:52.368 --> 00:09:57.137
outside of the US, as far as times you can check
out the shows and the rest of our content, go to

00:09:57.137 --> 00:10:03.866
wheniscriticalrole.com for updated air times in
your timezone. Keep an eye out on that.

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:06.589
LIAM: We're going to time change again here?

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:08.195
MATT: Yes. We gain an hour.

00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:09.929
TRAVIS: You fall back.

00:10:09.929 --> 00:10:12.859
MARISHA: We sleep longer.

00:10:12.859 --> 00:10:21.519
MATT: We gain an hour. They're archaic,
unnecessary means of changing our times each year.

00:10:22.048 --> 00:10:25.253
TALIESIN: We're getting two daylight savings
times, because we had one in London too. So we get

00:10:25.253 --> 00:10:27.973
two hours. We should travel the world.

00:10:27.973 --> 00:10:29.676
MATT: I don't think that works that way.

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:31.012
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure it does.

00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:32.702
MATT: You might be right.

00:10:32.702 --> 00:10:35.431
TALIESIN: I want a judgement call on that.

00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:36.575
MATT: Fair enough.

00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:39.078
LIAM: Jet lag absolutely destroyed any gain we
got.

00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:41.258
TALIESIN: I know. I'm well aware.

00:10:41.258 --> 00:10:45.111
MATT: Last but not least, I want to thank all of
our fantastic European critters and beyond who

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:54.839
came out to MCM London this past weekend. Our
first European convention and it was magnificent.

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:01.576
The turnout was insane. You guys broke MCM London,
confusing all sorts of other guests about what the

00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:08.138
hell this thing is. I loved the fact that Kit
Buss, our official artist from the first campaign,

00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:13.226
had a far longer line than Frank Miller the entire
weekend. It was pretty fantastic.

00:11:13.226 --> 00:11:15.077
TRAVIS: All the love in the world to Frank
Miller.

00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:16.883
MARISHA: The legendary Frank Miller.

00:11:16.883 --> 00:11:18.084
TRAVIS: That is crazy.

00:11:18.084 --> 00:11:23.989
LIAM: Also lots of love to Kit Buss who's a good
friend of the show, and a good friend of ours, and

00:11:23.989 --> 00:11:28.284
it was so cool meeting you guys from all over the
fucking planet, man. Amazing.

00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:32.757
MATT: Got to meet a bunch of people from the CR
Translate team, bunch of fantastic artists and

00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:35.551
writers and general amazing community members.
Thank you for coming out.

00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:37.088
MARISHA: And of course, Arsequeef.

00:11:37.088 --> 00:11:42.430
MATT: Of course, Arsequeef. Legitimately fantastic
gentleman. This definitely will not be our last

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.918
time to Europe. Don't worry, because that was
amazing.

00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:50.165
TRAVIS: Laura and I will get our travel situation
fixed. We didn't know raw plutonium was not

00:11:50.165 --> 00:11:58.040
allowed in the UK. We travel with it always. It is
a fantastic gem. Put it under the moonlight and it radiates.

00:11:58.064 --> 00:12:03.222
MATT: What's great is the longer you keep it next
to Ronin, he doesn't actually have to feed.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.442
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.

00:12:04.442 --> 00:12:09.276
(laughter)

00:12:09.276 --> 00:12:11.325
LIAM: (deep voice) Hey, how you doing?

00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:17.980
MATT: I believe that's the extent of our
announcements, and as such that brings us in to

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.787
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:12:22.787 --> 00:12:27.314
[TV static, click]

00:12:27.314 --> 00:13:41.286
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:13:44.439 --> 00:13:46.743
(laughter)

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:56.189
MATT: Points to Travis on that one. It's the
ellipses at the end. Like a little squeak. Last we

00:13:56.189 --> 00:14:01.583
left off, The Mighty Nein, in pursuing a thread of
a mysterious orb that seemed to connect in some

00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:09.418
way to the entity in which Fjord has somehow
connect himself to, and as such been granted these

00:14:09.418 --> 00:14:14.687
strange eldritch powers, led you southward from
the Menagerie Coast after commandeering a ship

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:20.553
called The Mist, turned into The Mistake. Followed
it through some dangerous reefs to a pirate ship

00:14:20.553 --> 00:14:26.961
called the Squalleater, and there on the captain,
Avantika. You made a pact with her, where the

00:14:26.961 --> 00:14:32.878
choice was to either die or to help aid her and a
companion she hired for this to help navigate this

00:14:32.878 --> 00:14:40.519
island. This strange, seemingly dangerous or
cursed island, to which you made your way through

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:47.645
the jungle of this Urukaxl. Managed to avoid
lizardmen. Managed to barely sneak through a

00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:53.402
ancient city of yuan-ti. Making your way to the
top of this temple and through the interior. A

00:14:53.402 --> 00:15:00.034
series of battles later, an encounter with a
strange lightless internal orchard in which two of

00:15:00.034 --> 00:15:03.630
the fruit within had been eaten by two members of
your team and have been tripping balls ever since.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.745
SAM: That's right. Oh god.

00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:12.387
MATT: You made your way to the bottom,
subterranean, guardian chamber, where you met a

00:15:12.387 --> 00:15:21.804
yuan-ti abomination that was laying guard to the
true guardian: a large hydra. The hydra had turned

00:15:21.804 --> 00:15:25.860
around and laid waste to much of your party, but
you managed to, through a series of clever

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.515
choices, uses of fire magic, and some rapid
assaults, managed to cleave all the heads from its

00:15:31.515 --> 00:15:38.143
body and kill it just in time. Its corpse now
lying fresh on the ground, Captain Avantika

00:15:38.143 --> 00:15:45.049
seeming pleased and impressed by the display of
the strange, new compatriots that have now come to

00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:51.148
work under her. You now sit in the stillness of
this chamber, able to now finally take a moment to

00:15:51.148 --> 00:15:59.946
look about and see what secrets or mysteries it
holds. So Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

00:16:02.388 --> 00:16:07.389
SAM: Was any of that real?

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:10.448
TRAVIS: Oh no. You're still...

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:23.086
LIAM: We just need to wait this out. We killed all
the creatures. How many eyes do I have right now?

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:25.022
Because it feels like I have three of them.

00:16:25.022 --> 00:16:26.877
SAM: You do. You have three eyes.

00:16:26.877 --> 00:16:29.354
LIAM: That's good.

00:16:29.354 --> 00:16:33.180
MARISHA: What's Avantika doing?

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:39.104
MATT: Avantika is sitting down for a second and
getting her breath. The rest of you who are still

00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:49.573
up in the hallway, which is Jester, Caduceus, and
Jamedi and Caleb, all begin to slowly descend the stairs.

00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:52.079
LIAM: Whoa.

00:16:52.079 --> 00:17:05.328
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's been a fucking thing in here.
What's so funny? Hey, zip it. The hydra, did it

00:17:05.328 --> 00:17:08.623
(sliding) back in the hole, or is it still out?

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:11.962
MATT: No, it's currently slung over the side of
the staircase that curves down into the

00:17:11.962 --> 00:17:14.401
subterranean chamber.

00:17:18.795 --> 00:17:22.355
MARISHA: How do they make you sound differently?
It feels like you sound different because of the

00:17:22.355 --> 00:17:25.072
gloves. I think it's just in my head.

00:17:25.072 --> 00:17:30.450
TRAVIS: It's just in your head. I got stung by
some wasps out by the barn.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.401
(laughter)

00:17:33.401 --> 00:17:39.076
TRAVIS: Ah! Y'all have Benadryl?

00:17:39.076 --> 00:17:42.354
MATT: Two healing potions and an EpiPen. Hold on.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:46.081
TRAVIS: That was a thing. Caduceus?

00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:47.378
TALIESIN: Yeah?

00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:49.198
TRAVIS: Is Jamedi up there?

00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:51.613
TALIESIN: In theory.

00:17:52.028 --> 00:17:56.254
MATT: Jamedi's currently standing at the top,
glancing around the side.

00:17:56.254 --> 00:17:59.162
TALIESIN: I assure you, it's safe now.

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:04.808
LIAM: Oh yeah. Hey, you guy! How come you did not
do anything?

00:18:04.808 --> 00:18:13.141
MATT: He glances around and steps down another
step. "I was not paid to do anything of this sort.

00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:21.334
"I was a guide. I was to delve. I am not skilled in
the ways you are. I'm not stupid to throw myself

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:24.208
"in front of a beast so large."

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:28.699
SAM: Worried you could maybe die?

00:18:28.699 --> 00:18:35.683
LIAM: It was pretty touch-and-go. Do you want to
sit back and stay safe and then get eaten? I am

00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:37.817
really not myself right now.

00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:42.355
MARISHA: Yeah. You're being super aggro. It's
intense.

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:44.419
TALIESIN: Is Jamedi wearing any weapons?

00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:46.907
MATT: Actually, make a perception check.

00:18:48.272 --> 00:18:50.487
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to use this new d20
and see how that goes.

00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:51.890
SAM: Oh, where'd you get this?

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:56.968
TALIESIN: The con. Ah! That's good. That's a good
start. 27.

00:18:56.968 --> 00:19:05.145
MATT: Looking at his person, he has a short bow
and a dagger, and that is it. He's not armed for

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:11.512
any sort of main assault. In fact, most of his
equipment and materials, in the way he's armored

00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:19.282
and dressed, is for expediency, lack of sound, and
meant to blend into his surroundings fairly easy.

00:19:19.282 --> 00:19:25.182
A lot of browns, grays, and dull greens. He's
definitely more of a scout and a tracker, based on

00:19:25.182 --> 00:19:29.395
his skill set from what you've seen, than any sort
of frontline fighter.

00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:35.920
MARISHA: I want to go over to Avantika.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:45.450
MATT: As you approach, she gets up and rummages
off the side and pulls off a small lantern she

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.044
keeps notched on the side of her belt.

00:19:49.044 --> 00:19:52.832
MARISHA: Do I see anything else tucked up under
there while she is doing that that looks of

00:19:52.832 --> 00:19:55.299
interest or of importance?

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:58.321
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:19:59.702 --> 00:20:02.709
MARISHA: Okay, okay. 19.

00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:10.340
MATT: Nothing in particular beyond what she
previously had, that you can tell at the moment,

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.826
no. It's a small lantern, maybe that big, and she
pulls a piece of cloth out that was meant to keep

00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:19.552
it from clattering or making any noise on the
inside. She pulls out the cloth, tucks it in her

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:26.318
pocket, ignites the end of an oil wick. The
lantern glows a bit and gives off some light. She

00:20:26.318 --> 00:20:29.369
begins walking along the walls of the inside of
the chamber.

00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:34.990
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Detect Magic.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.972
MARISHA: On the lantern?

00:20:36.972 --> 00:20:42.245
TALIESIN: On everything. Including our friends and
everything in the room.

00:20:42.245 --> 00:20:47.761
TRAVIS: I'll mirror Avantika's movement on the
other side of the room.

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:54.098
MATT: As you cast Detect Magic, a few things. All
of your friends give off a faint aura. Everything

00:20:54.098 --> 00:21:04.021
but Jamedi gives off a magical aura. You also
sense the columns themselves have a fairly

00:21:04.021 --> 00:21:12.595
powerful, deep magical aura to them. That's the
most you can see at the moment.

00:21:12.595 --> 00:21:15.872
TALIESIN: Nothing Jamedi is wearing at all is
giving off a--?

00:21:15.872 --> 00:21:25.689
MATT: Nothing. Fjord, as you begin to walk along
what would be considered the southern walls around

00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:33.013
this side of the chamber, you and Avantika,
looking across, the walls appear to be made of the

00:21:33.013 --> 00:21:41.334
same eldest stone that this temple is made from.
The newer materials that have been plastered and

00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:49.379
set against what once was this original temple did
not make its way this far into the basement. It

00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:55.913
seems that there is no intent to cover, or at
least, hasn't gotten to the point of covering what

00:21:55.913 --> 00:22:00.701
originally lined the walls of this chamber, and as
such, the original carvings remain. What you see

00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:08.018
are three massive carved murals on that wall, that
wall, and this far side, mirroring the placement

00:22:08.018 --> 00:22:16.956
of the three pillars. These murals stand probably
15 feet tall and about 20 or so feet wide. You can

00:22:16.956 --> 00:22:24.621
see them depicting these giant, faintly detailed
and gently colored scenes, though a lot of the

00:22:24.621 --> 00:22:31.483
coloration seems to have faded with dust and time.
Some of the stone has been stained or painted to

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:36.877
show some variation in color. You can make out the
simple shapes to fill out this much larger

00:22:36.877 --> 00:22:43.864
tapestry on the stone before you. The one on that
far wall, as you come across it, you see a crowd

00:22:43.864 --> 00:22:51.483
of people. Simple design, but definitive heads and
shoulders and legs. You can see the humanoid form,

00:22:51.483 --> 00:22:57.292
and there are many, many clustered around the base
of this mural. Above them, you can see three

00:22:57.292 --> 00:23:08.204
larger humanoid figures that are haloed by a light
or an aura that elevates them beyond this crowd.

00:23:08.204 --> 00:23:16.918
Three figures. Then over the top of that, taking
up probably 60 percent or more of this mural, you

00:23:16.918 --> 00:23:25.714
see a humongous bird of dark purple flame that is
wreathing the sky above this crowd. You see its

00:23:25.714 --> 00:23:32.768
wings curved upward and then bent down, and where
the wings end, fire curls and burns, and the

00:23:32.768 --> 00:23:39.764
feathers on the edges of these wings definitively
come up into a purple and dark gray flame with

00:23:39.764 --> 00:23:46.645
bits and specks of deep red. At the top where its
head looks down, the beak long and pointed, there

00:23:46.645 --> 00:23:57.200
are three eyes across its face, and in each of
these eyes you see set a rather large onyx stone.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.696
SAM: It's a bird?

00:23:58.696 --> 00:24:00.358
MATT: A large, flaming bird.

00:24:00.358 --> 00:24:01.777
MARISHA: Like a phoenix?

00:24:01.777 --> 00:24:06.222
MATT: Like a phoenix, but dark purples and grays
and deep reds in color.

00:24:06.222 --> 00:24:11.047
LIAM: Three eyes, each one is an onyx stone?

00:24:11.047 --> 00:24:17.091
MATT: Each one of those eyes is an onyx stone.
Probably about that big.

00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:23.616
TALIESIN: Mr. Fjord, I feel like I should mention
I'm keeping a lookout for anything and I'm getting

00:24:23.616 --> 00:24:29.692
a bit of a magical aura from the three columns. I
don't know if it's related to this.

00:24:29.692 --> 00:24:35.698
LIAM: Are you reading anything off of all of the
eyes that I am seeing, those stones?

00:24:35.698 --> 00:24:40.887
MATT: You don't see any magical essence on the
carving or the stones, just from those pillars.

00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:49.683
Glancing at the pillars, too, there's faint carved
designs and shapes, like swirling, almost

00:24:49.683 --> 00:24:56.686
serpentine circles and curves that chain into each
other and swirl off. Imagine a column made of

00:24:56.686 --> 00:25:04.860
chains, if you will, but the patterns are erratic
in places and don't seem to follow.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:10.027
TALIESIN: The three columns are very similar,
there's nothing unique, the pattern within them

00:25:10.027 --> 00:25:12.031
doesn't deviate too much?

00:25:12.031 --> 00:25:13.042
MATT: From what you can tell, no.

00:25:13.042 --> 00:25:14.698
TALIESIN: All right.

00:25:14.698 --> 00:25:21.546
MATT: That's the far wall. If you continue curving
around to the one closest to me, you meet up with

00:25:21.546 --> 00:25:29.645
Avantika at that point. She holds her lantern up,
and you can see a very similar layout, a very

00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:37.213
familiar showing of a crowd. Much like the
previous one, though some of their shapes have

00:25:37.213 --> 00:25:44.539
different shoulders. It looks almost like their
clothing or whatever their accoutrements are are

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:54.000
different. It seems to insinuate a different
people. Above them, three more figures stand,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:07.910
shown larger and emanating some sort of radiance
or aura. Above that, you see this giant, coiled

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:14.939
serpent of scale, fin, and eyes made of amber.
Each of these eyes is a separate amber piece about

00:26:14.939 --> 00:26:22.486
that big around, the size of a large gold piece,
all along the coil of its body. At the very top,

00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:31.943
where it's rearing up, this very long, thin,
pointed, almost lizard-like maw opens up, and

00:26:31.943 --> 00:26:37.257
behind it, this giant tidal wave is curling and
frozen in place, looking like it's about to bear

00:26:37.257 --> 00:26:41.198
down on and either destroy or sweep away the crowd
below it.

00:26:41.198 --> 00:26:47.010
LIAM: Question: do the eyes in this picture bear
any resemblance to the tattoos I spied through the

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.972
window when I eavesdropped through Frumpkin on
Fjord and Avantika's conversation?

00:26:51.972 --> 00:26:52.862
MATT: Very much so.

00:26:52.862 --> 00:26:54.104
LIAM: Very much so, okay.

00:26:54.104 --> 00:26:56.207
SAM: Two eyes on this one?

00:26:56.207 --> 00:27:03.995
MATT: On this one, the head of it has three eyes
as well, but the body itself has eyes evenly

00:27:03.995 --> 00:27:06.968
spaced around the entire length of its coiled
body.

00:27:06.968 --> 00:27:10.572
LIAM: Und amber for the three eyes on the head,
or every single time?

00:27:10.572 --> 00:27:16.711
MATT: Every single eye on it is a piece of amber,
matching size.

00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:23.065
TRAVIS: The eyes, they're there, right? It's part
of the mural, they're not missing or recessed or anything?

00:27:23.381 --> 00:27:26.207
MATT: They all appear to be present.

00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:32.869
LIAM: You described the first group looked
humanoid, no strange features, just arms, legs,

00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:37.833
head, but for the second one with the serpent
they're a little weird?

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:43.233
MATT: More detail has been put into them. More
care has been placed into their carving.

00:27:43.233 --> 00:27:46.044
TRAVIS: Onyx eyes for the first creature...

00:27:46.044 --> 00:27:52.683
MARISHA: Amber eyes for the second. What about the
third? I'll go over and look at the far mural.

00:27:52.683 --> 00:27:59.831
MATT: Avantika continues curving around with a
big, wide-eyed smile on her face. As she passes by

00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:05.225
it, she goes, "This is incredible."

00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:12.948
TRAVIS: Yes, it's very stimulating. Have you ever
seen imagery like this before?

00:28:12.948 --> 00:28:17.217
MATT: "I can only assume this is carved by the
Ki'Nau."

00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:19.633
TRAVIS: Yeah, yep, the Ki'Nau.

00:28:19.633 --> 00:28:20.580
MARISHA: The quinoa?

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:25.784
TRAVIS: Nope, the Ki'Nau. They're the followers of
Uk'otoa, right?

00:28:25.784 --> 00:28:27.339
MATT: "That is correct."

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:28.912
SAM: The Ki'Nau?

00:28:28.912 --> 00:28:31.405
TRAVIS: Ki'Nau.

00:28:31.405 --> 00:28:37.294
MATT: She continues curving around. Beau and
Caduceus, as you walk to the other wall, that side

00:28:37.294 --> 00:28:46.764
of the chamber, there you see a curling, thick
worm of some kind. Its folded skin and tooth-like

00:28:46.764 --> 00:28:53.244
scales burrowing up to produce mountains over the
crowd, cliff faces made of stone and rock breaking

00:28:53.244 --> 00:28:59.388
and about to plummet into the crowd below. There
beneath it you see three figures once more

00:28:59.388 --> 00:29:07.195
elevated, the same wreath around them of some sort
of radiance or light. The people below don't seem

00:29:07.195 --> 00:29:15.632
scared. There's no sign of fleeing or fear, just a
gathering. Within this large, terrifying,

00:29:15.632 --> 00:29:22.650
worm-like creature, its form bulbous with these
strange protrusions, these spine-like scales that

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:30.335
you can imagine would pull it through the broken
earth, you see this ring of teeth that accentuates

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:41.167
where its mouth is, and on the inside, where a
tongue would be, there instead are three eyes

00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:52.696
across the inside of its mouth. These appear to be
made of some kind of ivory, some polished, white material.

00:29:52.696 --> 00:29:56.626
SAM: Wow. That is vivid.

00:29:56.626 --> 00:30:03.355
LIAM: Also the three figures on each wall, are
they standard humanoid form?

00:30:03.355 --> 00:30:07.545
MATT: The three figures all appear to be humanoid.
They're not detailed enough to the point where you

00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:11.518
can see features to differentiate between elven,
human, halfling.

00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:15.780
SAM: Do they seem to be the same three on each, or
is it just silhouettes?

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.443
MATT: It's just silhouettes of three figures.

00:30:17.443 --> 00:30:22.245
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:30:22.245 --> 00:30:30.799
MATT: You hear Avantika's voice echo from across
the way. She goes, "These are the Chosen." She

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:38.667
brings light over towards the one of Uk'otoa on
the wall and goes, "I guess that makes this one

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:43.343
"me?" She takes her finger and takes a little blood
from the corner of her mouth from the fight and

00:30:43.343 --> 00:30:49.307
draws a little smiley face on one of the three.
"And this one is you," and goes and draws another

00:30:49.307 --> 00:30:51.137
face on the middle one.

00:30:51.137 --> 00:31:00.375
TRAVIS: I can see the resemblance. The question
is, if that's you, and that's me, who's our third friend?

00:31:00.375 --> 00:31:02.238
MATT: "That is a very good question."

00:31:02.238 --> 00:31:05.545
TRAVIS: You said you had met only one other Chosen
before.

00:31:05.545 --> 00:31:06.946
MATT: "Only one, yes."

00:31:06.946 --> 00:31:09.512
TRAVIS: And what happened to them?

00:31:09.512 --> 00:31:21.019
MATT: "They were a very informative partner. They
are the one that introduced me to the great

00:31:21.019 --> 00:31:29.299
"possibility of power under Uk'otoa. We traveled
this ocean for quite a number of years together,

00:31:29.299 --> 00:31:37.084
"but they proved to be a coward. They took
something important to our mission and vanished,

00:31:37.084 --> 00:31:45.025
"and I have spent many years trying to recover what
they stole. With no luck. I figured it was more

00:31:45.025 --> 00:31:52.414
"worth my time to pillage enough coin to pay other
people to find them for me. And so far, based on

00:31:52.414 --> 00:31:57.461
"the fact that it brought you to me, a much more
successful endeavor, eh?"

00:31:57.461 --> 00:32:02.642
TRAVIS: Indeed. This person that seemed to have
shown you the light, did you try to track them

00:32:02.642 --> 00:32:08.604
down? Do you know anything about them or where
they might be? They would seem to be very useful

00:32:08.604 --> 00:32:10.623
in our current situation.

00:32:10.623 --> 00:32:17.612
MATT: "This is very true. Well, it seems I may
have some information. Let's get back to the ship,

00:32:17.612 --> 00:32:24.384
"eh? Let's finish our business here and let's talk
over a glass of wine."

00:32:24.384 --> 00:32:32.102
TRAVIS: Well, we're obviously not in a huge rush.
We have not explored all of this.

00:32:32.102 --> 00:32:37.128
MATT: "This is true." She begins to make her way
towards the well at the center of the chamber.

00:32:37.128 --> 00:32:40.212
TALIESIN: I was heading that way myself.

00:32:40.212 --> 00:32:44.787
LIAM: Is there any writing of any kind?

00:32:44.787 --> 00:32:51.062
MATT: Glancing about at the pillars, you two can
see within the shapes glowing runes that trace

00:32:51.062 --> 00:32:57.895
from ceiling to floor, then across the ground and
all meet at the well.

00:32:57.895 --> 00:33:03.063
LIAM: Am I able to read it with the Comprehend
Languages that should still be cooking, because

00:33:03.063 --> 00:33:04.392
it's an hour-long spell?

00:33:04.392 --> 00:33:10.896
MATT: It's not technically a language. These are
runes. These are glyphs of some kind. Make an

00:33:10.896 --> 00:33:12.945
arcana check.

00:33:14.027 --> 00:33:20.715
LIAM: Come on, dice. Be good to me. No. That is a
17.

00:33:20.715 --> 00:33:28.420
MATT: There are different epochs in historical
time in which there have been advances and

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:35.803
developments of arcane runes and sigils. There is
the early basis of magical runes, which is a

00:33:35.803 --> 00:33:41.874
deviation of Draconic as a language, and then
there are ways that they've been altered and made

00:33:41.874 --> 00:33:50.589
more efficient. These are very old, base, early
Draconic runes. As such, they hold a lot more very

00:33:50.589 --> 00:33:58.384
primal magical power, and usually are reserved for
larger rituals and magics that are meant to last

00:33:58.384 --> 00:34:06.384
for very long periods of time. The nature of the
magic on these runes, from what you can tell, it's

00:34:06.384 --> 00:34:16.159
a little hard to get the direct essence, but there
is some sort of an abjuration-based magic.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:28.713
SAM: I'm going to go investigate-- not the hydra,
the creature that I killed.

00:34:28.713 --> 00:34:35.441
MATT: You head on over to the other yuan-ti, and
as you approach, the body lies there, tongue

00:34:35.441 --> 00:34:45.886
lolling out and drool and blood, a mixture of
thick saliva mingling with the dark black-purple

00:34:45.886 --> 00:34:51.019
blood out of the corner of its mouth, its eyes
wide open and rolled back. Its dark, thick green

00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:57.168
scales of its snake-like head and thick, muscular
scaled torso all lie limp across the stone where

00:34:57.168 --> 00:35:04.151
it was slain. Its blade has clattered to the
ground a few feet from its grasp and its polished

00:35:04.151 --> 00:35:09.798
marble and silver shield scattered a few feet from
its form. The rest of its tail coils and is limp

00:35:09.798 --> 00:35:12.747
off to the side from there.

00:35:12.747 --> 00:35:16.980
SAM: I'll rifle around looking for any keys or
objects.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.883
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:20.986
SAM: 25.

00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:29.694
MATT: Nice. You find on its body 26 pieces of
gold. Only gold, no other pieces of coin on its

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:38.655
body. The blade is a very, very large blade. It
looks like it's well made, both for ceremonial

00:35:38.655 --> 00:35:45.022
purposes and for actual combat. It is both
beautiful and very well made, and the shield

00:35:45.022 --> 00:35:50.323
itself is also exquisitely crafted and shows no
signs of wear.

00:35:50.323 --> 00:35:56.077
SAM: I'll take the shield and hang on to it until
I can give it someone who wants it.

00:35:56.077 --> 00:36:03.984
MATT: Okay. At this point, Avantika's walked to
the edge of the well and looks down into the space below.

00:36:03.984 --> 00:36:06.437
MARISHA: I walk up behind her and I go, huh!

00:36:06.437 --> 00:36:07.209
MATT: Do you really?

00:36:07.209 --> 00:36:08.074
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:36:08.074 --> 00:36:09.237
SAM: Like, pushing her?

00:36:09.237 --> 00:36:12.607
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't actually push her in but I
just want to freak her out.

00:36:12.607 --> 00:36:14.107
TRAVIS: She's going to do that.

00:36:14.107 --> 00:36:19.243
MATT: She whips around as you do that and both her
hand grabs your wrist to deflect it and you wrench

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:22.863
your wrist free as a natural instinct and you both
have this moment of--

00:36:22.915 --> 00:36:26.426
MATT and MARISHA: Eh!

00:36:26.426 --> 00:36:33.248
TRAVIS: You know, I do have a solution I think for
this. Jamedi! You worthless sack of shit, you

00:36:33.248 --> 00:36:39.529
haven't done a damn thing since we got in this
temple. You like to scout ahead, go forward? Get

00:36:39.529 --> 00:36:41.346
your ass down that well.

00:36:41.346 --> 00:36:45.980
MATT: He's still at the top of the stairs. He
goes, "Well, for one thing, I was paid to go to

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:54.726
"the temple, and no further. The fact that I have
even come this far is because I need to claim my pay."

00:36:54.726 --> 00:36:58.632
TRAVIS: What do you want, a cookie? Get down the
fucking well, let's go.

00:36:58.632 --> 00:37:05.610
MATT: Avantika goes, "Actually, I think ladies
first."

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:12.341
TRAVIS: Well, I would insist to join you, if that
is the case.

00:37:12.341 --> 00:37:15.619
MATT: "May the best one win." She dives in.

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:16.677
TRAVIS: Shit balls.

00:37:16.677 --> 00:37:20.735
LIAM: Wait, Fjord! Can I talk to you for a second
before you go down there?

00:37:20.735 --> 00:37:21.742
TRAVIS: Real quick.

00:37:21.742 --> 00:37:28.690
LIAM: There is-- the pillars are covered when I do
the shield-- when I cover myself and put the

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.481
shield-- the columns have that in them.

00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:32.570
TRAVIS: The pillars are magic?

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:39.563
LIAM: Yeah, but it's protection. It's holding
something in or holding something back. We know

00:37:39.563 --> 00:37:42.531
what that thing is with the yellow eyes but what
is the tapeworm?

00:37:42.531 --> 00:37:45.365
TRAVIS: I don't know. I don't want her to get too
far ahead.

00:37:45.365 --> 00:37:47.562
SAM: I have a few things that I'd like to talk
about.

00:37:47.562 --> 00:37:49.042
TRAVIS: Okay, go.

00:37:49.042 --> 00:37:56.710
MATT: Okay, you jump in. First off, Caleb's
distraction has given her quite a lead. She's a

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:04.619
fairly accomplished swimmer and is making her way
down. This well continues on for a good 70, 80 or

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:10.042
so feet below. The water is cold. It is salt
water.

00:38:10.042 --> 00:38:11.689
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:13.110
MARISHA: Salt water?

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:17.460
TRAVIS: Salt water, not brackish but salt water?

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.180
MATT: Right. You are swimming after her?

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.000
TRAVIS: Mhm.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.860
MATT: Make an athletics check. You have advantage
because the water is-- because of your armor, it's

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.501
not giving you as much resistance heading south.

00:38:30.501 --> 00:38:35.285
TRAVIS: Athletics? 19.

00:38:35.285 --> 00:38:41.877
MATT: You begin to close the gap slowly, but she's
eagerly swimming down with almost a fervor. As you

00:38:41.877 --> 00:38:51.913
get deeper into this column, this basin below, the
walls begin to grow thick with algae and grime

00:38:51.913 --> 00:39:02.459
like a thick-- It could be a plant matter that's
just accrued over the walls, or it could be waste

00:39:02.459 --> 00:39:07.741
matter from the hydra in its home that has slowly
congealed to cover the walls. The stone begins to

00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:15.095
give way to this dark, slick material. Once you
hit about the 70, 80 foot point, the tunnel begins

00:39:15.095 --> 00:39:22.192
to open like a giant bulb or internal, spherical
chamber. Role another athletics check.

00:39:24.948 --> 00:39:27.390
TRAVIS: 14.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:35.019
MATT: She's still keeping her distance from you.
Heading deeper in, the saltiness of the water, the

00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:42.149
brininess, the flavor in your mouth gets more
intense. What was once a semblance of sea water is

00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:49.885
definitively sea water, but also very strongly
briny sea water. Make another athletics check.

00:39:49.885 --> 00:39:52.604
TRAVIS: The bulb-- we've entered that chamber,
right?

00:39:52.604 --> 00:39:53.880
MATT: Correct.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.953
TRAVIS: What's our visibility like? 40, 60?

00:39:56.953 --> 00:40:04.082
MATT: For you, because you have dark vision, you
can see within 30 feet of you, essentially. As far

00:40:04.082 --> 00:40:05.548
as you look the chamber is--

00:40:05.548 --> 00:40:08.044
TRAVIS: There's not a lot of natural light,
right?

00:40:08.044 --> 00:40:16.910
MATT: No. Not at all. It's pitch black down here.
That being the case, you don't see the bottom of

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.155
the chamber, you just see it open--

00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:20.110
TRAVIS: And just her.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.936
MATT: And just her, but she's gaining.

00:40:21.936 --> 00:40:24.307
TRAVIS: James Cameron going down to find the
Titanic.

00:40:24.307 --> 00:40:28.450
MATT: Just delving straight down into the
darkness. Make another athletics check.

00:40:30.857 --> 00:40:31.982
TRAVIS: 20.

00:40:31.982 --> 00:40:35.871
MATT: 20, okay. She did not role that well that
time. She's beginning to tire, it seems, or at

00:40:35.871 --> 00:40:42.651
least you're starting to pick up speed. As you
continue to follow, you get probably 40 or so feet

00:40:42.651 --> 00:40:48.121
from her, but she's still ahead of you. Role
again.

00:40:52.931 --> 00:40:54.796
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:40:55.181 --> 00:41:04.672
MATT: Natural 20, nice! She rolled okay. You see,
now, the bottom begin to approach. In the

00:41:04.672 --> 00:41:12.051
peripheral of your dark vision, the floor greets
to meet you and you pick up enough speed to where

00:41:12.051 --> 00:41:18.807
you both impact the bottom of this chamber at the
same time. You both hit. She looks up at you, and

00:41:18.807 --> 00:41:25.259
your eyes meet. A few bubbles escape from her
mouth and you see her big, wide, toothy grin and

00:41:25.259 --> 00:41:28.346
she begins scraping grime off the floor.

00:41:28.346 --> 00:41:29.379
TRAVIS: I do the same.

00:41:29.379 --> 00:41:31.485
MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.

00:41:32.076 --> 00:41:35.716
TRAVIS: I don't know what I'm looking for. 23.

00:41:35.716 --> 00:41:37.391
MATT: 23!

00:41:37.391 --> 00:41:39.825
TRAVIS: Plus five.

00:41:39.825 --> 00:41:47.881
MATT: As the two of you are currently scraping
bits of grime and algae off the ground, there are

00:41:47.881 --> 00:41:54.132
bits of plants that are growing up like lightless
kelp that seems to have made some sort of a living

00:41:54.132 --> 00:41:58.636
down here in this subterranean, water-filled
chamber. As you're pushing through and scraping

00:41:58.636 --> 00:42:05.754
around, your hand scoops this large bit of grime
from in front of you and you can see a stone

00:42:05.754 --> 00:42:14.426
relief at the very base of the bottom, a concave,
spherical shape about the size of a fist.

00:42:14.426 --> 00:42:20.936
TRAVIS: Uh huh.

00:42:20.936 --> 00:42:31.968
MATT: She notices it, looks at it, looks at you.
What are you doing?

00:42:33.925 --> 00:42:40.327
TRAVIS: Could I try and stick my hand in my
chest?

00:42:40.327 --> 00:42:41.306
MATT: You can.

00:42:41.306 --> 00:42:44.181
TRAVIS: Does it go anywhere?

00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:50.709
MATT: You go and jam your hand and its hitting
your armor. You have a full-on leather plate right there.

00:42:58.532 --> 00:43:04.504
TRAVIS: I don't know what to do. Like the size of
a fist? It's a sphere, right?

00:43:04.504 --> 00:43:10.638
MATT: It's about that big, and you can see it is
concave. It's about the size of the stone that

00:43:10.638 --> 00:43:12.196
you'd found.

00:43:12.196 --> 00:43:15.043
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's in my body.

00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:16.327
SAM: Poop it out.

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:21.521
TRAVIS: I don't know how! I don't have an eject
button! Can I summon the falchion?

00:43:21.521 --> 00:43:26.459
MATT: You can. The falchion appears in your hand,
and as you do this bright, yellow light is now

00:43:26.459 --> 00:43:30.962
emanating from the center of its hilt where the
eye itself is glowing with its own lantern-like

00:43:30.962 --> 00:43:35.814
source. At which point Avantika is now rushing
towards that thing.

00:43:35.814 --> 00:43:37.845
TRAVIS: Something's about to happen and I just jam
the eye into the--

00:43:37.845 --> 00:43:42.666
MATT: Make an initiative roll. Because you gave
her enough time to get up right next to you and

00:43:42.666 --> 00:43:47.705
now we're going to see who gets to it first.

00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:52.259
TRAVIS: Six.

00:43:56.039 --> 00:44:02.415
MATT: Her hand-- she has now pulled the glove from
her right hand. As you go to thrust the hilt of

00:44:02.579 --> 00:44:10.716
the falchion down towards it, you see her hand
reach out and just manage to cover the little

00:44:10.716 --> 00:44:19.891
space first. As it does, you can see her body
tense for a second, and where her hand is this

00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:26.709
bright, familiar yellow glow seems to now spread
from between her fingers sending beams off in

00:44:26.709 --> 00:44:34.315
multiple directions. Her face looks aghast in
shock for a second, and a large bubble escapes

00:44:34.315 --> 00:44:40.708
from her mouth. She looks over to you with this
dazed look and pulls her hand back. There, in the

00:44:40.708 --> 00:44:46.480
palm, there's this large open wound where blood's
beginning to cloud the dark water below. There, in

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:58.559
the center of this hole, you can see one of the
cloven stones there. At which point, a bunch of

00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:06.524
these runes begin to glow in three different
directions from around the base, up the sides, up

00:45:06.524 --> 00:45:09.105
the chamber.

00:45:09.105 --> 00:45:14.992
The rest of you, looking around, suddenly see this
dull blue glow begin to get brighter from within

00:45:14.992 --> 00:45:19.215
this well. You watch as these runes, that you guys
didn't notice except for the two of you before,

00:45:19.215 --> 00:45:24.483
begin to suddenly glow up the sides. The three
pillars suddenly begin to spiral and glow as all

00:45:24.483 --> 00:45:29.223
these runes come to life. Avantika pulls back and
looks back at her hand, she looks back at you, her

00:45:29.223 --> 00:45:39.181
eyes blink for a second, and she just smiles and
you hear this earth-shuddering, soulful crack

00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:46.233
sound rocks the entirety of the temple. Bubbles
suddenly, this one burst of air that had been

00:45:46.233 --> 00:45:52.381
trapped in the ground below, is all immediately
released as one and rises the water above. You can

00:45:52.381 --> 00:45:58.019
look around and see the interior of this; there is
a heavy black crack in the stone of this chamber

00:45:58.019 --> 00:46:04.872
as you guys all hear this earth-shattering bam!
Dust falls off the ceiling of this chamber from

00:46:04.872 --> 00:46:11.261
the inside. The pillars themselves still stand,
but there are multiple places in this chamber now

00:46:11.261 --> 00:46:17.386
where these large black cracks now seem to have
snaked their way in one instant burst across parts

00:46:17.386 --> 00:46:18.730
of the wall.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.308
LIAM: They are picking the lock on this safe.

00:46:21.308 --> 00:46:25.427
MATT: The glowing runes blink out.

00:46:25.427 --> 00:46:29.391
TALIESIN: I think the lock's picked.

00:46:29.391 --> 00:46:38.703
LIAM: Maybe. They might need three. There's two of
three. I'm eyeing Jamedi as I say that. Presumably

00:46:38.703 --> 00:46:49.358
just two of three. As long as it's just one, maybe
Fjord is thinking better of it.

00:46:49.358 --> 00:46:54.272
TRAVIS: I immediately start searching on the
ground for another opening.

00:46:54.272 --> 00:46:56.546
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:46:56.546 --> 00:47:03.413
MARISHA: Maybe it's not all here. Maybe it's in
another location. Maybe there are two other temples.

00:47:03.413 --> 00:47:04.839
TRAVIS: 12.

00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:10.842
MATT: You start pulling through the weeds and the
kelp and the grime and-- nothing. It's all smooth

00:47:10.842 --> 00:47:17.670
stone except for this one little alcove that you
found first. Avantika is now swimming frantically

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.371
up towards the surface.

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:21.791
TRAVIS: Frantically?

00:47:21.791 --> 00:47:24.893
MATT: Just trying to kick. She lost quite a bit of
air.

00:47:24.893 --> 00:47:27.463
TRAVIS: I'll go grab her.

00:47:27.463 --> 00:47:32.124
MATT: You go grab her? Okay. Make a grapple
check-- make an athletics check.

00:47:32.458 --> 00:47:34.121
SAM: Stone cold.

00:47:35.973 --> 00:47:37.026
TRAVIS: Seven.

00:47:37.026 --> 00:47:41.932
MATT: No, she kicks right out of your grasp. She
looks back with an expression of surprise.

00:47:41.932 --> 00:47:45.333
TRAVIS: I'm pointing at the ground.

00:47:45.333 --> 00:47:47.968
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:47:47.968 --> 00:47:50.228
TRAVIS: I'm okay at those.

00:47:50.228 --> 00:47:52.288
SAM: Travis, you have your fate, too.

00:47:52.288 --> 00:47:54.386
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:47:54.386 --> 00:48:00.672
MATT: She looks confused and continues swimming
upward, not reading too much into it. She

00:48:00.672 --> 00:48:05.057
continues to clamber up to the surface. The rest
of you, as you're looking about, the surface of

00:48:05.057 --> 00:48:10.210
the water begins to spill over the sides of the
well.

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:14.646
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading towards the
stairs. I'm going to recommend everybody else,

00:48:14.646 --> 00:48:16.758
let's go.

00:48:16.758 --> 00:48:18.236
SAM: That sounds good, yes.

00:48:18.236 --> 00:48:23.783
MATT: He goes, "Yeah, okay, of course." Jester's
like, "This is not very good. Where's Fjord?"

00:48:23.783 --> 00:48:28.363
She's looking over very nervously towards the
pool, which now the chamber's rapidly filling.

00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:29.920
You're already at knee height.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.696
SAM: He likes water. He'll be fine. Come on! Let's
get out of here.

00:48:32.696 --> 00:48:35.631
MARISHA: I stand with Jester at the edge of the
pool, looking down.

00:48:35.631 --> 00:48:40.691
MATT: Okay, you guys, glancing down. Jamedi's back
in the chamber, his eyes wide, goes, "We should

00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:44.740
"go. Bring her back, she owes me money!"

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.277
LIAM: I'm grabbing Nott by the scruff and dragging
her up the stairs.

00:48:47.277 --> 00:48:50.572
SAM: You don't have to drag me, I'm going!

00:48:50.572 --> 00:48:51.883
LIAM: Okay.

00:48:51.883 --> 00:48:57.846
MATT: As you guys all begin to climb up the
stairs, the chamber is filling very quickly with

00:48:57.846 --> 00:49:03.007
the water. It's now reaching the base of the
stairs, at which point, as you guys-- Beau, you

00:49:03.007 --> 00:49:06.358
and Jester, there's just enough water now where
your buoyancy carries you off your feet and you're

00:49:06.358 --> 00:49:11.468
now actually treading water in the chamber. At
which point Avantika makes it to the surface with

00:49:11.468 --> 00:49:16.424
a large gasp of air, and but a few moments later
Fjord also breaks the surface.

00:49:16.424 --> 00:49:18.301
SAM: Come on, Fjord, let's get out of here!

00:49:18.301 --> 00:49:19.283
TRAVIS: Wait, what's happening?

00:49:19.283 --> 00:49:23.941
SAM: The water! Bad water! All water's bad, but
this is even worse.

00:49:23.941 --> 00:49:25.282
MARISHA: What the hell happened?

00:49:25.282 --> 00:49:28.880
MATT: It's continuing to fill. The stairway that's
leading upward, the water has now reached the base

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:35.580
of the doorway, and you have a few moments, maybe
six seconds or so before the doorway itself is

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.855
completely filled with water.

00:49:36.855 --> 00:49:38.369
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

00:49:38.369 --> 00:49:42.259
MATT: You're all going into a full swim here,
double move, half speed for all of you guys, so

00:49:42.259 --> 00:49:43.904
it's going to take you a little bit.

00:49:43.904 --> 00:49:45.004
SAM: I'm walking up.

00:49:45.004 --> 00:49:50.269
MATT: Except for you. You guys are already up
there. As you all get to the stairway and make

00:49:50.269 --> 00:49:55.309
your way up to the top, the water continues to
pour up, following behind you. You get to the

00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:59.371
stairs, and you're having to trudge through. You
get up to the next, the secondary floor, and there

00:49:59.371 --> 00:50:07.451
you stand, with the walls that are partially
relieved and covered, and there is the stone slab

00:50:07.451 --> 00:50:11.351
that is lifted up, and there's orchard before you.
What do you do?

00:50:11.351 --> 00:50:13.321
SAM: Oh, the orchard, that's right.

00:50:13.321 --> 00:50:15.092
TRAVIS: Were there-- There were stairs up the
sides, right?

00:50:15.092 --> 00:50:16.359
LIAM: Weren't there spiral stairways?

00:50:16.359 --> 00:50:19.885
MATT: Yeah, there is the fountain, but it has
been-- It rose back up to the top when this

00:50:19.885 --> 00:50:21.388
chamber door was opened.

00:50:21.388 --> 00:50:22.836
SAM: Oh, so there's no stairs?

00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:26.791
MATT: Currently, no. It's raised up and closed
off, the front, when you opened the doorway to get

00:50:26.791 --> 00:50:28.813
deeper into the basement.

00:50:28.813 --> 00:50:30.659
LIAM: Can we see to the ceiling of this chamber?

00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:33.875
MATT: Make a perception check. With you,
disadvantage because you are human.

00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:38.943
LIAM: Eyes up. Make a perception, you said?

00:50:38.943 --> 00:50:39.750
MATT: Yes.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:40.725
LIAM: 15.

00:50:40.725 --> 00:50:46.331
MATT: You can see the pillar that holds the
fountain at the top, and there are the stairs,

00:50:46.331 --> 00:50:50.383
still part of it, and you can see where it's up
there, but whatever mechanism, rocks--

00:50:50.383 --> 00:50:52.314
LIAM: Yeah, it's stuck up there, ja?

00:50:52.314 --> 00:50:53.593
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:50:53.593 --> 00:50:54.802
SAM: Let's climb!

00:50:54.802 --> 00:50:56.591
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Is everybody outside?

00:50:56.591 --> 00:50:57.691
SAM: Oh, shit!

00:50:57.691 --> 00:50:59.048
TALIESIN: Is everybody in the chamber right now?

00:50:59.048 --> 00:50:59.888
TRAVIS: Fucking hourglass, damn it.

00:50:59.888 --> 00:51:03.202
MATT: The central chamber is now-- The water has
now reached the base of orchard and is now filling.

00:51:03.202 --> 00:51:05.772
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit the button to re-close
the-- to close the--

00:51:05.772 --> 00:51:07.352
MATT: You don't know the button, you never found
it.

00:51:07.352 --> 00:51:08.438
TALIESIN: Oh, who did?

00:51:08.438 --> 00:51:09.695
MATT: I don't know, who did?

00:51:09.695 --> 00:51:10.922
TRAVIS: It was Nott.

00:51:10.922 --> 00:51:11.463
TALIESIN: Yeah?

00:51:11.463 --> 00:51:12.174
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:51:12.174 --> 00:51:14.410
TALIESIN: Okay, do you mind hitting the button to
close this thing again?

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:22.066
SAM: Oh, yes! Sure! It was one of these holes. I'm
going to just pick one. I go to the north one.

00:51:22.066 --> 00:51:24.002
MATT: Okay, you go to the--

00:51:24.002 --> 00:51:25.353
TRAVIS: Oh, god, which one was it?

00:51:25.353 --> 00:51:29.106
SAM: I don't know. I don't remember. I'm just
going to go into one of-- Aren't these-- there's

00:51:29.106 --> 00:51:30.899
little holes, right?

00:51:30.899 --> 00:51:34.578
MATT: There are. As you can see now, the water
that has begun to fill up the chamber is taking--

00:51:34.578 --> 00:51:38.427
It's a little slower in here, because it's a much
wider space now, but you can see eggs starting to

00:51:38.427 --> 00:51:45.061
flow, float out from the other chambers. The other
two rooms were the two hatchery areas where you

00:51:45.061 --> 00:51:47.021
saw the larger eggs were set.

00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:48.996
MARISHA: Right. Hang on.

00:51:48.996 --> 00:51:50.366
SAM: Do I remember which one was the--

00:51:50.366 --> 00:51:51.175
MARISHA: I do.

00:51:51.175 --> 00:51:53.191
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

00:51:53.191 --> 00:51:59.053
SAM: Nine. Oh, plus six? No, this is not a saving
throw.

00:51:59.053 --> 00:52:00.112
MATT: No, it's just straight bonus.

00:52:00.112 --> 00:52:01.846
SAM: Plus three? So, 12.

00:52:01.846 --> 00:52:04.493
MATT: You recall it was in the chamber where
you're standing, and it's not too far from the

00:52:04.493 --> 00:52:07.556
stairs where you guys descended below.

00:52:07.556 --> 00:52:12.741
SAM: Okay. Do I see a little door, a little hole
near where I'm standing?

00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:16.671
MATT: You look over to the side. Make a quick
investigation check.

00:52:16.671 --> 00:52:18.647
SAM: Natural 20.

00:52:18.647 --> 00:52:20.450
MATT: You reach over, and you find it, and you hit
it.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:21.408
TRAVIS: Come on!

00:52:21.408 --> 00:52:23.769
MATT: The door slams shut and locks you in the
room.

00:52:23.769 --> 00:52:24.884
SAM: Locks me--

00:52:24.884 --> 00:52:25.680
MARISHA: What?

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.597
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

00:52:26.597 --> 00:52:29.628
MATT: You hear a grinding on the other side of the
chamber of the fountain lowering.

00:52:29.628 --> 00:52:31.022
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:52:31.022 --> 00:52:31.859
SAM: Fountain lowering?

00:52:31.859 --> 00:52:32.570
TRAVIS: Right.

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.167
LIAM: So the fountain lowered, but Nott is trapped
inside--

00:52:34.167 --> 00:52:36.895
MATT: Nott, and everybody else who hasn't left
that chamber, is inside. The only people that said

00:52:36.895 --> 00:52:41.107
they were leaving that room, I believe, were
Caduceus, who was going up.

00:52:41.107 --> 00:52:43.230
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was going because I was-- oh,
god.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.917
MATT: So all of you are now locked in the chamber
with Nott.

00:52:44.917 --> 00:52:46.551
MARISHA: Oh, wait, can you open it?

00:52:46.551 --> 00:52:48.453
LIAM: Wait, we're in the chamber? We're all inside
there?

00:52:48.453 --> 00:52:49.859
MATT: You're all in the chamber with Nott, yeah.

00:52:49.859 --> 00:52:50.781
TRAVIS: That chamber goes downstairs, right?

00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:53.095
SAM: I will open it up again.

00:52:53.095 --> 00:52:56.487
MATT: The fountain raises up, the chamber opens up
again.

00:52:56.487 --> 00:52:58.080
TALIESIN: Mage Hand! Come on!

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.583
TRAVIS: Come on out!

00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:01.698
SAM: Everybody out! I cast Mage Hand!

00:53:01.698 --> 00:53:06.763
MATT: Okay. You move around, you cast Mage Hand.
The door slams shut, the two other doors slam

00:53:06.763 --> 00:53:11.533
shut. The chamber now is about waist high in
water, and you watch as the pillar begins to

00:53:11.533 --> 00:53:17.609
slowly lower. It is a slow drag down.

00:53:17.609 --> 00:53:19.874
MARISHA: Okay, let's go. Come on.

00:53:19.874 --> 00:53:21.040
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to climb up.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.096
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:53:22.096 --> 00:53:25.837
MATT: Okay. The stairway itself, if you recall,
ends a little bit ways up, and there's a bit of a

00:53:25.837 --> 00:53:31.902
drop down to get to it. It slowly comes down and
does meet the floor. There's a bit of a lip to get

00:53:31.902 --> 00:53:36.642
up there now, so if you ascend to the top of the
staircase, there is about a ten foot or so jump

00:53:36.642 --> 00:53:39.695
where it is smooth walls before you can actually
get to the top floor.

00:53:39.695 --> 00:53:40.359
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:53:40.359 --> 00:53:41.243
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:53:41.243 --> 00:53:42.929
TALIESIN: We'll get up there and drop a rope.

00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:44.844
MARISHA: Yeah, I can do that.

00:53:44.844 --> 00:53:46.136
TRAVIS: Let's try that.

00:53:46.136 --> 00:53:47.053
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:53:47.053 --> 00:53:49.433
SAM: Like to make the jump? Do you want to jump
off of Yasha or anything?

00:53:49.433 --> 00:53:50.141
MARISHA: Sure.

00:53:50.141 --> 00:53:51.070
TALIESIN: Can Yasha fly?

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.053
MARISHA: Give me a boost, the cheerleader hoist?

00:53:53.053 --> 00:53:59.244
MATT: Yasha goes over and gives you a boost. That
gives you advantage on your acrobatics check to

00:53:59.244 --> 00:54:02.528
try and parkour up the stairs and leap off the
sides.

00:54:02.528 --> 00:54:03.950
MARISHA: Jesus Christ!

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:06.945
LIAM: I'm going to cast Dancing Lights and send
four globules up around the roof so that everyone

00:54:06.945 --> 00:54:08.921
can see everything perfectly.

00:54:08.921 --> 00:54:11.530
MARISHA: 12 on my acrobatics.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:17.894
MATT: You leap, slide off the side and manage to
fall down into the water next to it. You come out

00:54:17.894 --> 00:54:22.512
of the surface. The chamber is now halfway full,
and it's almost starting to reach to the top.

00:54:22.512 --> 00:54:25.040
MARISHA: It's really slippy.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.322
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and-- Oh, god.

00:54:27.322 --> 00:54:28.314
SAM: Give me a boost!

00:54:28.314 --> 00:54:29.508
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're tall.

00:54:29.508 --> 00:54:31.400
TALIESIN: All right. I'm actually weak, somebody
stronger is probably good.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.766
SAM: I'm going to scurry up Mr. Clay and jump.

00:54:34.766 --> 00:54:36.779
LIAM: Wait, I cast Enlarge on Caduceus so he's
twice his size!

00:54:36.779 --> 00:54:38.065
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:54:38.065 --> 00:54:40.703
MATT: Mighty Caduceus.

00:54:40.703 --> 00:54:41.760
TALIESIN: I'm tall now.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.383
MATT: Yes.

00:54:42.383 --> 00:54:44.588
TALIESIN: I'm very tall. I might be taller than
the hole.

00:54:44.588 --> 00:54:45.746
TRAVIS: 15 feet tall.

00:54:45.746 --> 00:54:49.651
MATT: You're tall enough to the point where I'd
say, because it's double the size, right?

00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:50.551
LIAM: Double the size, ja.

00:54:50.551 --> 00:54:52.387
MATT: So you're 14 feet. You're not tall enough
for the whole chamber, but you're tall enough to

00:54:52.387 --> 00:54:53.870
push people through.

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:55.278
TALIESIN: Right, yeah. I'm pushing people through.

00:54:55.278 --> 00:54:59.969
MATT: Alley oop-ing one after the other, you grab
each person and lift them up. Like a little

00:54:59.969 --> 00:55:07.336
booster into the chamber. One by one, you guys all
get up into the top now, and Caduceus, you're too

00:55:07.336 --> 00:55:08.657
big to get up--

00:55:08.657 --> 00:55:11.961
LIAM: Yeah, Caduceus, hold Fjord's hand. Fjord,
hold his hand, you got it?

00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:13.140
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yep.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.828
LIAM: I cast Reduce, and now he is half his size.

00:55:15.828 --> 00:55:18.302
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:55:18.302 --> 00:55:20.077
TRAVIS: I pull him up top.

00:55:20.077 --> 00:55:24.677
MATT: You pull Caduceus up. You guys are now in
the chamber, standing there, there's the stairs

00:55:24.677 --> 00:55:29.918
that lead up. At which point you hear footfalls,
and you see coming around the corner down-- It

00:55:29.918 --> 00:55:32.731
seems that the sound of the resounding crack in
this temple has drawn the attention of three

00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:36.712
yuan-ti. They turn the corner, you see one of
them, two snake arms a familiar sight as one of

00:55:36.712 --> 00:55:41.102
the malisons comes down and two broodguard are
there. What are you doing? The water is now

00:55:41.102 --> 00:55:44.962
spilling up past out of the hole, and now the top
room is now starting to fill with water.

00:55:44.962 --> 00:55:46.386
TRAVIS: So are we in the top level now?

00:55:46.386 --> 00:55:47.050
MATT: You are.

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:51.023
TRAVIS: We are. Yep-eb-eb. I'm tapped spell-wise.

00:55:51.023 --> 00:55:53.779
SAM: I'm just going to just go (screaming) and
start shooting at the first one.

00:55:53.779 --> 00:55:55.048
MATT: Go for it.

00:55:55.048 --> 00:55:59.508
SAM: That's not great, it's a 14.

00:55:59.508 --> 00:56:03.765
MATT: At this point the water seems to have
accelerated and has now filled the chamber. As you fire--

00:56:03.765 --> 00:56:05.123
SAM: 16 to hit.

00:56:05.123 --> 00:56:06.087
MATT: All right.

00:56:06.087 --> 00:56:07.819
TALIESIN: I'm casting Spirit Guardians and rushing
them.

00:56:07.819 --> 00:56:13.172
MATT: Okay. You're now underwater. You take your
last breath, and you've all completely been

00:56:13.172 --> 00:56:19.004
submerged in this chamber. The other yuan-ti you
can see in the darkness below here, the only bit

00:56:19.004 --> 00:56:23.561
of light that you have are the globes still from
you. Although, are those concentration?

00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:25.595
TALIESIN: I've got a light on my stick anyway.

00:56:25.595 --> 00:56:27.227
LIAM: Oh, they're gone then because Enlarge,
Reduce.

00:56:27.227 --> 00:56:28.089
MATT: Yes.

00:56:28.089 --> 00:56:29.541
TALIESIN: I would have cast Light on my stick,
then.

00:56:29.541 --> 00:56:32.836
MATT: So you're casting Light on your stick.

00:56:32.836 --> 00:56:36.798
TALIESIN: Anybody I don't like within 15 feet is
currently getting ransacked by tiny fairies.

00:56:36.798 --> 00:56:37.871
MATT: Okay.

00:56:37.871 --> 00:56:40.880
(laughter)

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:47.332
MATT: I love it. What's the save on that? Wisdom,
I believe.

00:56:47.332 --> 00:56:49.068
TALIESIN: Wisdom 16.

00:56:49.068 --> 00:56:55.281
MATT: Okay, the malison succeeds, the two
broodguard fail. Roll damage on that.

00:56:55.281 --> 00:57:01.447
TALIESIN: That's-- Freaking out a little bit. 3d8
radiant damage?

00:57:01.447 --> 00:57:04.661
MATT: That is correct.

00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:13.418
TALIESIN: That's 11 (counting) 12 points of
radiant damage.

00:57:13.418 --> 00:57:15.353
MATT: 12 point of radiant damage, nice.

00:57:15.353 --> 00:57:16.697
LIAM: None of that was like a melee attack or
anything?

00:57:16.697 --> 00:57:17.606
TALIESIN: No.

00:57:17.606 --> 00:57:19.022
LIAM: Because your damage is reduced since you're
teeny.

00:57:19.022 --> 00:57:20.737
TALIESIN: It doesn't-- They're fairies.

00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:22.185
MATT: All right.

00:57:22.185 --> 00:57:26.238
TALIESIN: I'm heading straight towards the exit.

00:57:26.238 --> 00:57:28.530
MATT: What was the roll you had to hit?

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:29.858
SAM: 16 to hit.

00:57:29.858 --> 00:57:34.330
MATT: 16. That will hit the malison. You do not
get sneak attack, however.

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:39.543
SAM: That's fine. It causes nine hit points of
damage.

00:57:39.543 --> 00:57:42.143
MATT: Nice. That finishes your go there.

00:57:42.143 --> 00:57:45.716
SAM: I would probably bonus action-- if I had a
bonus action I would shoot again.

00:57:45.716 --> 00:57:48.570
MATT: I'd allow it. Because we'll say you're
like-- You were standing on the water so as you're

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:51.089
leaning over the surface you're like squeezing it
out.

00:57:51.089 --> 00:57:52.361
SAM: 16 to hit again.

00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:53.782
MATT: Nice.

00:57:53.782 --> 00:57:56.102
SAM: Another 11 points of damage.

00:57:56.102 --> 00:58:01.375
MATT: 11 points of damage, good. So, I now need
everyone to roll initiative.

00:58:01.375 --> 00:58:09.929
SAM: If I'm on top of the water, how much space do
I have?

00:58:09.929 --> 00:58:14.616
MATT: Well, now you don't anymore. The water
surface begins to crush underneath you and then

00:58:14.616 --> 00:58:18.392
you have to delve underneath as it meets it. It's
filled up and it's now making its way up the

00:58:18.392 --> 00:58:25.719
stairs, towards the top of the temple. So, 25 to
20, anyone?

00:58:25.719 --> 00:58:27.092
MARISHA: 20.

00:58:27.092 --> 00:58:28.217
MATT: All right.

00:58:28.217 --> 00:58:31.264
SAM: I'll roll for Jester. Terrible.

00:58:31.264 --> 00:58:32.585
MATT: And roll for Yasha.

00:58:32.585 --> 00:58:33.566
TRAVIS: I did.

00:58:33.566 --> 00:58:39.436
MATT: 20 to 15.

00:58:39.917 --> 00:58:41.592
TRAVIS: Nobody.

00:58:41.592 --> 00:58:43.259
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:58:43.259 --> 00:58:46.302
TRAVIS: Yasha got 13. Wow.

00:58:46.768 --> 00:58:47.855
MATT: Guys.

00:58:47.855 --> 00:58:49.759
(laugher)

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:52.260
MATT: All right. Ten to five.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:55.082
TALIESIN: Seven and seven. Both seven.

00:58:55.082 --> 00:58:56.414
LIAM: Seven over here as well.

00:58:56.414 --> 00:58:57.292
SAM: Nine over here.

00:58:57.292 --> 00:58:58.537
TRAVIS: Nott, Caduceus, Caleb.

00:58:58.537 --> 00:59:00.082
MATT: Nott and then Cad--

00:59:00.082 --> 00:59:01.409
TRAVIS: I rolled a natural one.

00:59:01.409 --> 00:59:03.322
MATT: Caleb and Jester?

00:59:03.322 --> 00:59:04.683
SAM: Jester had a seven.

00:59:04.683 --> 00:59:07.671
MARISHA: Jester--

00:59:07.671 --> 00:59:09.501
MATT: Then Fjord at the bottom.

00:59:09.501 --> 00:59:14.888
LIAM: I'm sorry, Dante, could you please describe
the-- Where everyone is physically, the enemies

00:59:14.888 --> 00:59:17.742
and us? Just so I can see it in my head a bit
better.

00:59:17.742 --> 00:59:20.097
MATT: Awesome. That was my Dante.

00:59:20.097 --> 00:59:20.962
LIAM: Yeah.

00:59:20.962 --> 00:59:24.429
TRAVIS: Want the hourglass gone. They freak me
out.

00:59:24.429 --> 00:59:27.706
MATT: That's okay, it just means you guys are now
in the process of slowly drowning.

00:59:27.706 --> 00:59:32.961
TRAVIS: Mercer, don't say that! (groaning)

00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:37.693
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond. And Tor Books everybody. Tor
Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:37.693 --> 00:59:39.874
LIAM and TRAVIS: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:39.874 --> 00:59:40.985
SAM: Nope.

00:59:40.985 --> 00:59:42.315
TRAVIS: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:42.315 --> 00:59:43.782
SAM: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books.

00:59:43.782 --> 00:59:45.108
MARISHA: Good times.

00:59:45.108 --> 00:59:48.929
TRAVIS: Aw, shit. We're back here again?
Drowning.

00:59:48.929 --> 00:59:50.886
SAM: Except now it's filled with water.

00:59:50.886 --> 00:59:52.711
MATT: It is--

00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:57.250
SAM: Ooh! How did you do that?

00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:58.968
(exclamations)

00:59:58.968 --> 01:00:01.331
MARISHA: Everyone hates the underwater levels.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.099
TALIESIN: They're also drowning too, right?

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:07.504
MATT: Well, since they're not officially in this--
Now that we are in combat--

01:00:07.504 --> 01:00:10.700
TRAVIS: (water breathing)

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.761
MATT: There is the nature--

01:00:12.761 --> 01:00:14.052
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:00:14.052 --> 01:00:24.347
MARISHA: Didn't we have some water breathing
potions? Somewhere?

01:00:24.347 --> 01:00:32.055
MATT: Caduceus just made his way up there. There's
Beau, and there's Jamedi.

01:00:32.055 --> 01:00:33.882
TALIESIN: Someone might have a water breathing
potion.

01:00:33.882 --> 01:00:39.412
MATT: Top of the initiative order. Beau, you're up
first. While you're in water, movement is

01:00:39.412 --> 01:00:48.881
considered difficult terrain. If I recall, attacks
are made at disadvantage while in water.

01:00:48.881 --> 01:00:58.962
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, we're definitely underwater.
Do we see the entrance or exit ahead of us?

01:00:58.962 --> 01:01:00.557
MATT: Those are the stairs that lead upward, yes.

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:02.951
MARISHA: So, if we just book it, we'll go--

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.186
MATT: Yeah, that's an option.

01:01:04.186 --> 01:01:05.291
MARISHA: We're just going to have these guys--

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:06.928
MATT: That is entirely an option you can do.

01:01:06.928 --> 01:01:15.238
MARISHA: Well, I'm a human with no magical
abilities, so I'm going to run.

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:20.429
LIAM: Also, the trapdoor--

01:01:20.429 --> 01:01:22.210
TRAVIS: (laughter) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.963
MARISHA: I can't do a whole lot.

01:01:23.963 --> 01:01:25.895
SAM: You have throwing stars.

01:01:25.895 --> 01:01:28.783
MARISHA: (pitiful noise of a throwing star flying
uselessly through water)

01:01:28.783 --> 01:01:30.252
TRAVIS: We haven't given her the key to the
trapdoor.

01:01:30.252 --> 01:01:35.318
LIAM: Ah, ja, son of Sparta, the trapdoor into
this place was like a metal grate, wasn't it? Not

01:01:35.318 --> 01:01:39.832
fully-- like, there were holes? Was it a metal
grate, or was it solid?

01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:44.928
MATT: There were holes above, but they were in the
ceiling, and they were part of the stonework. Up

01:01:44.928 --> 01:01:49.016
top, there was an actual trapdoor that you had
locked behind you.

01:01:49.016 --> 01:01:52.281
LIAM: Yeah, but not like metal with holes for the
water to go through?

01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:52.901
MATT: No.

01:01:52.901 --> 01:01:53.890
LIAM: No.

01:01:53.890 --> 01:02:00.132
MATT: That you know of. There are holes above,
which is where the sacrificial blood would drip

01:02:00.132 --> 01:02:04.983
through into the fountain. So, what are you doing,
guys? Are you running first?

01:02:04.983 --> 01:02:06.177
MARISHA: Uh huh.

01:02:06.177 --> 01:02:07.331
MATT: You're swimming?

01:02:07.331 --> 01:02:08.692
MARISHA: I'm swimming up.

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:10.400
MATT: (counting)

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.653
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point to do Step
of the Wind.

01:02:12.653 --> 01:02:13.775
MATT: Beau is also--

01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:14.803
TALIESIN: I'm also--

01:02:14.803 --> 01:02:16.578
TRAVIS: You've made it up the top.

01:02:16.578 --> 01:02:18.951
SAM: Is she hitting the trapdoor?

01:02:18.951 --> 01:02:22.419
MATT: No, she's not out of the temple. She's
heading up the stairs. She's out of the battle for

01:02:22.419 --> 01:02:23.364
the moment.

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:24.916
SAM: Got it.

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:29.505
MATT: So that finishes Beau's turn. It is now
their turn. They both rolled really high

01:02:29.505 --> 01:02:37.543
initiative, and you guys rolled really terribly.
The malisons closest are going to--

01:02:37.543 --> 01:02:40.306
TALIESIN: Is he getting within 15 feet of me?

01:02:40.306 --> 01:02:41.052
MATT: He is.

01:02:41.052 --> 01:02:43.789
TALIESIN: Okay, then. As he enters that space, he
has to--

01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:47.012
MATT: Well, he's still within 15 feet of you. So
at the top of his turn, he takes the save?

01:02:47.012 --> 01:02:51.697
TALIESIN: Your speed is halved while you're within
15 feet of me, and the creature enters the area

01:02:51.697 --> 01:02:53.744
for the first time or starts its turn there.

01:02:53.744 --> 01:02:57.883
MATT: All right. Natural 20 on its save, so it
takes half damage. It still takes damage.

01:02:57.883 --> 01:03:06.531
TALIESIN: So, the 3d8, that's 19. So, half of 19.

01:03:06.531 --> 01:03:13.921
MATT: So nine. This burst of radiant energy
inside-- (growling) There's bubbles that escape

01:03:13.921 --> 01:03:18.825
from its mouth. It's going to come forward and
take two swipes at you, Fjord, with both of its

01:03:18.825 --> 01:03:20.144
serpent hands.

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:21.549
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:25.910
MATT: All right. That is a 16 to hit.

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:27.423
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:03:27.423 --> 01:03:34.598
MATT: And a natural 20, but it has disadvantage
because it's in water. That is still a 19 to hit.

01:03:34.598 --> 01:03:36.764
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:03:36.764 --> 01:03:40.972
MATT: You do manage to take-- from one serpent,
you just manage to glide out of the way in the

01:03:40.972 --> 01:03:48.374
middle of the water. The second one, that is four
plus three, seven piercing damage, including ten

01:03:48.374 --> 01:03:49.893
points of poison damage.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:51.328
TRAVIS: Fuck, ten poison?

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.406
MATT: Yeah.

01:03:52.406 --> 01:03:54.141
TRAVIS: Is it diluted by the water?

01:03:54.141 --> 01:03:57.548
MATT: Unfortunately, no, because it's straight
from the fangs in your bloodstream. It surges pain

01:03:57.548 --> 01:04:05.121
in your chest. You also lose a bit of air
instinctively from the pain. So, consider now,

01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:07.276
your air supply is halved.

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:09.378
TRAVIS: Okay. Is that half my Constitution
modifier?

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:13.333
MATT: Essentially, the DC is going higher when we
start getting to that, depending on how long we're

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:14.672
down here.

01:04:14.672 --> 01:04:17.812
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:21.015
MATT: That ends his go. Now it's the two
broodguards.

01:04:21.015 --> 01:04:22.541
SAM: Root guards?

01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:24.340
MATT: Broodguards.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:28.953
TALIESIN: Okay, so he gets into my realm-- one of
them is within--

01:04:28.953 --> 01:04:31.941
MATT: They're both already within the radius, so
they both have to make wisdom saves.

01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:34.611
TALIESIN: I don't have to reroll, it's the same
for all three, right?

01:04:34.611 --> 01:04:36.524
MATT: At the top of the turn. It's a different
turn, so roll again.

01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:38.969
TALIESIN: The roll I just used, or a new roll?

01:04:38.969 --> 01:04:41.698
MATT: No, it's the top of their turn, it happens.

01:04:41.698 --> 01:04:45.577
TALIESIN: All right. That's--

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:48.374
MATT: Sorry, Spirit Guardians happens at the top
of the turn, it doesn't happen immediately.

01:04:48.374 --> 01:04:52.050
TALIESIN: Yeah, top of their turn.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.352
MATT: Yeah, at the top of their turn. So the
damage they would've taken this turn, they've

01:04:54.352 --> 01:05:01.413
already taken. So, we'll let that happen. Marking
that down. Good to remember. They both move

01:05:01.413 --> 01:05:04.868
forward. One broodguard is going to attack you,
Nott.

01:05:04.868 --> 01:05:06.375
SAM: Ah!

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:09.259
MATT: It's going to do two claw attacks and a bite
attack.

01:05:09.259 --> 01:05:10.199
SAM: Oh!

01:05:10.199 --> 01:05:15.223
MATT: Disadvantage on each, though. The first one
is a 15?

01:05:15.223 --> 01:05:16.698
SAM: Miss.

01:05:16.698 --> 01:05:19.942
MATT: One claw attack just goes wide. The other
one, 16.

01:05:19.942 --> 01:05:21.001
SAM: Hit.

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:25.583
MATT: One claw. You manage to duck under one. The
other one slams into the side of your body,

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:31.215
pushing you through the water and down into the
stonework, causing your hip to hit the side.

01:05:31.215 --> 01:05:37.291
That's going to do four points of slashing damage.
This giant, serpentine mouth out of its weird,

01:05:37.291 --> 01:05:43.308
lizard-like body is going to strike out and bite
you. Oh, two tens. That's 14 to hit.

01:05:43.308 --> 01:05:44.541
SAM: Miss.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:48.815
MATT: You manage to push up and jam your hand up
into its jaw and keep it from biting you, and push

01:05:48.815 --> 01:05:55.986
it away. The other one's going up towards Yasha.
Yasha was not raging. So the first one with

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:59.248
disadvantage is 15 to hit?

01:05:59.248 --> 01:06:00.649
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:06:00.649 --> 01:06:05.461
MATT: 15 hits. It's going to be a claw attack.
Ooh, eight points of slashing damage.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:06.806
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:06:06.806 --> 01:06:11.438
MATT: Next attack with a claw with disadvantage,
natural one. That is a complete miss. Yasha takes

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:15.782
one claw and (grunting) barely affects it. The
other one, she grabs its hand in the middle of the

01:06:15.782 --> 01:06:20.866
grasp and pushes it back. She grabs her sword,
ready now. As she is going to get her blade ready,

01:06:20.866 --> 01:06:26.963
it's going to bite towards the front of her jaw
and chest. That is 17.

01:06:26.963 --> 01:06:29.713
TRAVIS: That hit.

01:06:29.713 --> 01:06:33.373
MATT: She takes six points of piercing damage.

01:06:33.373 --> 01:06:35.135
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:06:35.135 --> 01:06:38.282
MATT: That ends the broodguards' turn. Yasha's up
next.

01:06:38.282 --> 01:06:42.654
TRAVIS: Yasha's up next. Cool. 14 points of
damage.

01:06:42.654 --> 01:06:48.941
MATT: Yasha's also lost quite a bit of air on that
turn. Those two hits that hit her? Mark down two

01:06:48.941 --> 01:06:51.633
hits of oxygen loss on her.

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:52.223
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:06:52.223 --> 01:06:56.327
MATT: Keeping tabs on this. This will come into
play in a bit, depending on what happens.

01:06:56.327 --> 01:07:00.716
TRAVIS: Where is she on the map?

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:01.773
MATT: She's right there.

01:07:01.773 --> 01:07:02.922
TRAVIS: Uh huh. She's in melee with someone?

01:07:02.922 --> 01:07:04.644
MATT: She's in melee with the broodguard, yes.

01:07:04.644 --> 01:07:11.475
TRAVIS: (laughter) Okay, she has to fight because
she's going to get hit again, and that would be

01:07:11.475 --> 01:07:19.232
bad for her right now. With her bonus action, she
would like to rage. She will take two attacks at

01:07:19.232 --> 01:07:22.143
the one that she's in melee with.

01:07:22.143 --> 01:07:25.061
MATT: She's in a rage? She has the reckless.

01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:26.462
TRAVIS: Already got the reckless.

01:07:26.462 --> 01:07:29.052
MATT: Okay, so that just makes it a straight
attack because she has disadvantage underwater.

01:07:29.052 --> 01:07:31.282
TRAVIS: Oh, balls and ass. Okay.

01:07:31.282 --> 01:07:36.063
SAM: (singing) Balls and ass. Ass, ass and balls.

01:07:36.063 --> 01:07:37.232
TRAVIS: 19.

01:07:37.232 --> 01:07:39.139
MATT: Definitely hits.

01:07:42.241 --> 01:07:52.098
TRAVIS: 3d6-- (counting) 13 points of damage for
the first one. The second one is a straight roll,

01:07:52.098 --> 01:07:53.693
the same thing, 19.

01:07:53.693 --> 01:07:55.304
MATT: Yeah, hits. That's just 2d6.

01:07:55.304 --> 01:08:01.860
TRAVIS: 2d6-- again, 13 points of damage.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:07.035
MATT: That one's looking really bad. After the
blasts that it took from the Spirit Guardians, and

01:08:07.035 --> 01:08:11.576
the two strikes from Yasha, you can see now
there's a cloud of dark crimson in the water

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:18.640
around it. It's thrashing about in pain. You can
see it looking a bit woozy in the dark water. That

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.340
finishes Yasha? You going to move at all?

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:21.582
TRAVIS: She will not move at all.

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:25.741
MATT: She can move around it. As long as she stays
in melee, she can still move around.

01:08:25.741 --> 01:08:29.052
TRAVIS: We'll come in melee, just more-- closer to
the stairs.

01:08:29.052 --> 01:08:32.507
MATT: I got you. That's what I figured. That
finishes Yasha's turn. Nott's up next.

01:08:32.507 --> 01:08:34.685
SAM: Who had I shot before?

01:08:34.685 --> 01:08:36.195
MATT: You had shot this one.

01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:43.676
SAM: Can I do something unconventional here, Matt,
and undo my last shot? So, give him back 11 points

01:08:43.676 --> 01:08:50.286
of damage. Because I'm holding a keg of gunpowder
and there's no way I can reload a crossbow while

01:08:50.286 --> 01:08:52.679
holding a keg of gunpowder.

01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:55.385
MATT: You can drop it for the moment, fire it, and
pick it back up.

01:08:55.385 --> 01:08:56.387
SAM: All right.

01:08:56.387 --> 01:08:57.850
MATT: I'll let that happen.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:08:59.157
TRAVIS: Good job, Ketchup.

01:08:59.157 --> 01:08:59.788
SAM: All right.

01:08:59.788 --> 01:09:03.804
MATT: Because there is water, and it's already
soaking. It's like-- (splashing, crossbow firing)

01:09:03.804 --> 01:09:04.940
SAM: All right.

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.122
MATT: I'll say, narratively, it makes sense.

01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:07.352
LIAM: It's slowly starting to sink

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:18.097
SAM: To the one who's on me, all up in my grill,
I'm going to touch them and cast Shocking Grasp.

01:09:18.097 --> 01:09:21.993
Which is a--

01:09:21.993 --> 01:09:23.511
MATT: Melee spell attack.

01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:25.146
SAM: Melee spell attack, so I roll at
disadvantage.

01:09:25.146 --> 01:09:27.201
MATT: With disadvantage, yes.

01:09:28.286 --> 01:09:30.355
SAM: Nine plus six, 15.

01:09:30.355 --> 01:09:31.466
MATT: 15 hits.

01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:32.462
SAM: Okay, great.

01:09:32.462 --> 01:09:34.175
MATT: AC is 14.

01:09:34.175 --> 01:09:40.855
SAM: I've never done this before. Let's see here.
I'm at 5th level, so it's 2d8. What's a d8?

01:09:40.855 --> 01:09:43.156
TALIESIN: It's like a little-- there you go.

01:09:43.156 --> 01:09:46.173
SAM: Hey, eight points of damage!

01:09:46.173 --> 01:09:49.556
MATT: Eight points of damage to it. As you reach
out and grab it-- (electric shock) You watch as

01:09:49.556 --> 01:09:55.919
its tongue retracts into its head and its eyes go
wide. (pained noise) It loses some air, and it

01:09:55.919 --> 01:09:58.703
eventually shakes and pushes off your hand.

01:09:58.703 --> 01:09:59.903
LIAM: It's a verbal spell.

01:09:59.903 --> 01:10:00.928
SAM: A what?

01:10:00.928 --> 01:10:02.421
LIAM: Verbal. You have to speak.

01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:03.605
SAM: Does that work?

01:10:03.605 --> 01:10:06.235
MATT: You can do it, but you lose a bunch of air
to do it.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:17.208
SAM: Oh, boy! I hate water. I'm going to swim
away, as fast as I can. I still have to disengage, right?

01:10:17.208 --> 01:10:18.106
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:10:18.106 --> 01:10:27.231
SAM: I will bonus action disengage and swim around
past Fjord. Yeah, around this way.

01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:28.479
MATT: This is as far as you can get.

01:10:28.479 --> 01:10:31.278
SAM: Going towards the exits.

01:10:31.278 --> 01:10:32.789
MATT: Swimming over--

01:10:32.789 --> 01:10:33.800
SAM: With one hand.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.392
MATT: That is your go, Nott. It is now Caduceus,
Caleb, and Jester. You guys can decide amongst

01:10:37.392 --> 01:10:38.858
yourselves the order.

01:10:38.858 --> 01:10:40.474
TALIESIN: I'll go last.

01:10:40.474 --> 01:10:46.126
LIAM: I'll go first because I'm scared. I'm going
to use my air to cast Expeditious Retreat on

01:10:46.126 --> 01:10:53.399
myself. So I, too, am going to spit out some air
and do this in the water. That doubles my speed,

01:10:53.399 --> 01:10:59.575
which I can use a bonus action for dashing, plus
my movement. I will swim up five feet and then

01:10:59.575 --> 01:11:01.684
towards the stairs.

01:11:01.684 --> 01:11:11.114
MATT: (counting) That gets you about there.

01:11:11.114 --> 01:11:12.982
LIAM: That's everything.

01:11:12.982 --> 01:11:15.552
MATT: You're right about there on the steps.

01:11:15.552 --> 01:11:16.183
LIAM: I'm dead.

01:11:16.183 --> 01:11:22.339
MATT: Swimming through the air. Okay, that
finishes Caleb's go. What's Jester doing?

01:11:22.339 --> 01:11:27.003
SAM: Jester would like to probably--

01:11:27.003 --> 01:11:30.039
TALIESIN: She's going to lose a little air, but
yeah. Is she engaged with anybody?

01:11:30.039 --> 01:11:33.095
MATT: She's engaged with this broodguard right
there.

01:11:33.095 --> 01:11:36.781
TALIESIN: Okay, then she will Toll the Dead.

01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:38.708
SAM: She will cast Toll the Dead.

01:11:38.708 --> 01:11:39.692
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:11:39.692 --> 01:11:41.286
MATT: That's a saving throw for him. What's the
save?

01:11:41.286 --> 01:11:42.895
SAM: 15 wisdom.

01:11:42.895 --> 01:11:46.759
MATT: That is a 13. That does not do it.

01:11:46.759 --> 01:11:48.189
TALIESIN: That's 2d8.

01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:49.299
MATT: 2d12, I think.

01:11:49.299 --> 01:11:50.251
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 2d12.

01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:51.326
MATT: He's already taken damage.

01:11:51.326 --> 01:11:53.207
TALIESIN: Where are my 12s?

01:11:53.207 --> 01:11:58.262
LIAM: Oh, question: Matt, did you move me two
groups of movement? Because it would be for the

01:11:58.262 --> 01:12:03.753
bonus action, action, and movement. So it'd be one
more third.

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:04.953
MATT: Casting the spell's a bonus action.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:09.541
LIAM: When you cast it, you get that extra juice,
and then bonus action on every following round?

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:12.024
MATT: Right, so yeah, you'd be up there.

01:12:12.024 --> 01:12:13.161
LIAM: Thank you.

01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:14.521
MATT: There you go. Thank you for the heads up on
that.

01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:15.403
TALIESIN: Ten points.

01:12:15.403 --> 01:12:19.484
MATT: Ten points? Oof. Yeah, he's not looking good
either. They're both looking pretty rough.

01:12:19.484 --> 01:12:23.556
TALIESIN: She's going to try to get the most
advantageous point towards the door as well.

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:31.405
MATT: She is currently-- Both of you, since you
cast spells, mark five points of lost air.

01:12:31.405 --> 01:12:34.605
SAM: Five points of lost air.

01:12:34.605 --> 01:12:36.015
LIAM : I'm just going to remember that.

01:12:36.015 --> 01:12:37.712
MARISHA: You have five? Total?

01:12:37.712 --> 01:12:41.647
MATT: For the purposes of this challenge, to keep
it interesting, five points before you're now

01:12:41.647 --> 01:12:46.026
starting to make-- is now considered how long you
can hold your breath going forward.

01:12:46.026 --> 01:12:48.731
TRAVIS: Oh fuck!

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:57.460
MATT: Each hit's a minute off the-- I'll have to
look at how I worked it out here. Essentially, at

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:02.867
this point now, Jester and Nott are going to have
to start making constitution saving throws each round.

01:13:02.867 --> 01:13:04.525
SAM: Awesome.

01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:09.908
TRAVIS: (panicked breathing) I was not prepared
for this so fast!

01:13:09.908 --> 01:13:15.260
MATT: That finishes Jester's go. She moves around
over there, behind the side. Caduceus, what're you doing?

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:20.112
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a blight staff swing
at that one that's right next to Yasha.

01:13:20.112 --> 01:13:22.624
MATT: Blight staff swing?

01:13:22.624 --> 01:13:24.448
TALIESIN: Right there.

01:13:24.448 --> 01:13:27.624
SAM: You are a tiny man.

01:13:27.624 --> 01:13:29.086
MATT: Disadvantage on the attack.

01:13:29.086 --> 01:13:31.511
TALIESIN: Oh, actually, that's true. Actually,
never mind. I'm not going to do that, I'm so

01:13:31.511 --> 01:13:35.710
sorry. I'm going to get them into the most
advantageous position to make sure that everybody

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:38.463
I want to hit is within 15 feet of me.

01:13:38.463 --> 01:13:41.374
MATT: Okay, so you're going to swim up on top of
the fountain.

01:13:41.374 --> 01:13:45.393
TALIESIN: I'm just going to hold my breath and
maintain my calm.

01:13:45.393 --> 01:13:46.842
MATT: Is that all you're doing?

01:13:46.842 --> 01:13:47.901
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:51.077
MATT: Okay, ends Caduceus' go. Fjord, you're up.

01:13:51.077 --> 01:13:57.961
TRAVIS: Wait, can I fire one Eldritch Blast and
make a melee attack?

01:13:57.961 --> 01:14:01.070
MATT: No. It's two Eldritch Blasts or two
strikes.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:06.614
TRAVIS: Great. I'm going to fire an Eldritch Blast
at the dick that's with Yasha.

01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:10.204
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack with
disadvantage.

01:14:13.585 --> 01:14:16.131
TRAVIS: Nope, that's fine. 16.

01:14:16.131 --> 01:14:18.831
MATT: 16 hits. Roll damage on him.

01:14:21.003 --> 01:14:23.891
TRAVIS: 1d10 for nine points of damage.

01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:26.451
MATT: Nine points of damage, all righty.

01:14:26.451 --> 01:14:27.982
TRAVIS: Is he still up?

01:14:27.982 --> 01:14:30.620
MATT: Still up. Hurt, but still up.

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.438
TRAVIS: I will send the other one that way as
well.

01:14:32.438 --> 01:14:33.620
MATT: Go for it.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.543
TRAVIS: I can't let Ash's character die. Awesome,
16.

01:14:37.543 --> 01:14:39.671
MATT: 16 hits again. Roll damage.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:43.995
TRAVIS: For 11 points of damage.

01:14:43.995 --> 01:14:49.273
MATT: 11 points of damage. That'll do it. You hear
the dull impact of the Eldritch Blast, and the

01:14:49.273 --> 01:14:54.772
second (impact) under the water. In that flash of
light, that second sickly, green glow flash in the

01:14:54.772 --> 01:15:01.886
water, one of the broodguards begins to float up
limply towards the ceiling, no longer alive.

01:15:01.886 --> 01:15:05.211
SAM: Check his body for gold!

01:15:05.211 --> 01:15:14.226
TRAVIS: I'm going to move away. I'm going to use
my 30 feet and take an attack of opportunity as I do.

01:15:14.226 --> 01:15:22.354
MATT: That will get you right about there on the
stairs. There you go, that'll do. You'll swim

01:15:22.354 --> 01:15:29.459
right there; that's perfect. It does get to swipe
at you with disadvantage. That's going to be nine

01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:36.080
plus five, that's 14.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.354
TRAVIS: So it misses?

01:15:37.354 --> 01:15:45.379
MATT: It does! It scrapes across your shield as
you swim away quickly, just barely making it! That

01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:47.550
finishes your turn, Fjord. Beau, you're up.

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:50.690
MARISHA: Okay, what do I see? Where am I? Quick
look around!

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:54.349
MATT: You're going up the staircase, but you're
part way up.

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.772
MARISHA: The water's still filling?

01:15:55.772 --> 01:15:59.805
MATT: Yeah, still filling, and it's still above
you, like you can maybe catch up to the top if you

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:04.539
want to. If you use your full movement, you'll get
up to the top where the door is.

01:16:04.539 --> 01:16:08.960
MARISHA: I'm going to keep moving upwards, and
while I'm doing that, I want to take out the

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:17.926
50-foot rope we have. Then I want to grab
something heavy that I have. I've got to have

01:16:17.926 --> 01:16:23.563
something stupid and heavy that I don't care
about, and I want to tie it to the other end. A

01:16:23.563 --> 01:16:28.413
crowbar! I take the crowbar and then tie it, and I
drop it down the well with the rope.

01:16:28.413 --> 01:16:30.001
MATT: Downstairs, you mean?

01:16:30.001 --> 01:16:31.070
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:35.838
MATT: You tie, take the crowbar and throw it
behind so it's like (bouncing) and rolls partway

01:16:35.838 --> 01:16:37.142
down the stairs.

01:16:37.142 --> 01:16:41.703
MARISHA: I want to take the rope and double-grab
it around me and keep hauling ass up the stairs.

01:16:41.703 --> 01:16:47.012
MATT: Okay, with that, you'll make it all the way
to the top. You get to the small inner chamber,

01:16:47.012 --> 01:16:50.108
which is now halfway to stomach-filled. Making it
to the top, you look up and you can see there is--

01:16:50.108 --> 01:16:55.551
it's a little bit crouch-down, there is the latch,
and there is the lock mechanism beneath it.

01:16:55.551 --> 01:16:58.232
MARISHA: Fuck! It's locked?

01:16:58.232 --> 01:17:01.163
MATT: Yeah. You locked it behind you when you guys
entered the temple.

01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:02.854
TRAVIS: Who has the fucking key? One of us has the
key; who has the key?

01:17:02.854 --> 01:17:04.314
MARISHA: Is there a key? Where's the key?

01:17:04.314 --> 01:17:05.789
TRAVIS: Who found the key?

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:10.373
MATT: Somebody found the key. It was on one of the
guys from the first encounter of this chamber.

01:17:10.373 --> 01:17:14.305
SAM: Snake temple key! It says it right here on
the equipment list. Jester has it!

01:17:14.305 --> 01:17:16.832
MARISHA: Jester has the key!

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:24.780
MATT: Well, it's their turn now. The malison going
to make its saving throw. That's going to be a 14.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.225
What's the DC?

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:33.392
TALIESIN: I believe that's full damage. Let's see.
Spirit Guardians? 16!

01:17:33.392 --> 01:17:38.020
MATT: 16? So roll full damage on that. 3d8.

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:43.669
TALIESIN: Not bad. 16 points.

01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:50.960
MATT: 16 points of damage. Ooh, he's looking
really bad.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.903
TALIESIN: Are the other two not doing anything, by
the way?

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:57.695
MATT: When it comes to their turn. One of them's
dead now.

01:17:57.695 --> 01:18:01.507
TALIESIN: No, I mean our other two friends.

01:18:01.507 --> 01:18:05.252
MATT: The other two, their turn's next. We'll get
to that when he finishes his turn, but one of them

01:18:05.252 --> 01:18:06.982
is dead, so there's only one other guy.

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:07.983
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:13.516
MATT: The malison, in a burst of angry pixies
swarming around his body, is looking really hurt.

01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:19.700
As he moves around, the trail of blood stays in
the water behind the head as it shifts around.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:24.739
Both of the serpent arms look up towards Caduceus,
the source of these angry spirits, and is going to

01:18:24.739 --> 01:18:27.033
make two strikes against him.

01:18:27.033 --> 01:18:28.580
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:34.262
MATT: Because you're the one right there. That is
13 to hit?

01:18:34.262 --> 01:18:35.775
TALIESIN: Nope!

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:41.568
MATT: Second strike, that's a 12!

01:18:41.568 --> 01:18:43.451
TALIESIN: Nope!

01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:53.453
MATT: It's like 18, six; 16, eight. Bad rolls!
Both serpent strikes from its arms reach out

01:18:53.453 --> 01:18:57.635
towards you, and Caduceus, you're tiny enough
right now. Although, are you still holding the

01:18:57.635 --> 01:18:59.114
tiny spell on Caduceus?

01:18:59.114 --> 01:19:00.954
LIAM: I have not released it yet, no.

01:19:00.954 --> 01:19:02.844
MATT: Is Expeditious Retreat concentration?

01:19:02.844 --> 01:19:06.530
LIAM: Oh, is it? 'Tis, so it's dropped, so he's
regular size.

01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:11.657
MATT: Okay, so you're regular form, and you bear
down with the shield, and deflect both.

01:19:11.657 --> 01:19:13.231
TALIESIN: Just letting the fairies do the work.

01:19:13.231 --> 01:19:20.475
MATT: Bits of green and pinkish lichen torn off
and float away in the water away from the strikes.

01:19:20.475 --> 01:19:27.933
That finishes its go. The other broodguard has to
make another save, that is a seven plus-- no, that

01:19:27.933 --> 01:19:30.213
does not make it, so full damage on the other
broodguard.

01:19:30.213 --> 01:19:32.401
TRAVIS: Are we getting the impression that they're
totally comfortable underwater?

01:19:32.401 --> 01:19:37.534
MATT: No, actually.

01:19:37.534 --> 01:19:39.259
TALIESIN: 15 points of damage.

01:19:39.259 --> 01:19:40.300
MATT: 15 points of damage, that'll do it.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.756
TRAVIS: Ooh, it does?

01:19:41.756 --> 01:19:45.826
MATT: This guy also sparks and dies in the water.

01:19:45.826 --> 01:19:49.415
MARISHA: Go Jester, go Jester, go!

01:19:49.415 --> 01:19:55.896
MATT: That's Caduceus' spell. That finishes their
go. Yasha's up.

01:19:55.896 --> 01:20:03.759
TRAVIS: Yasha will fucking hi-ho silver out that
bitch! She has 40 feet, so 20--

01:20:03.759 --> 01:20:07.543
TALIESIN: Oh no. She's out, I thought. She's out!

01:20:07.543 --> 01:20:14.286
MATT: Okay. Got you. (counting) Then moving the
rest way up, that will get her halfway up the

01:20:14.286 --> 01:20:16.681
steps. Put her there.

01:20:16.681 --> 01:20:18.575
TALIESIN: Yeah, get her out of there.

01:20:18.575 --> 01:20:21.667
MATT: Okay. Finishing Yasha's turn, Nott, you're
up.

01:20:21.667 --> 01:20:22.618
SAM: Oh boy.

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:26.666
TALIESIN: I would appreciate it, but up to you.

01:20:27.476 --> 01:20:31.443
SAM: Man, I really don't like this water.

01:20:31.443 --> 01:20:33.442
TALIESIN: No. No one does.

01:20:33.442 --> 01:20:37.759
SAM: Oh boy, all right.

01:20:37.759 --> 01:20:40.859
MATT: Shades of the kraken battle returning.

01:20:40.859 --> 01:20:43.910
TRAVIS: Are Avantika and Jamedi doing anything?

01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:52.052
SAM: I will doggy paddle towards the snake-hand
man and hit him with another zap.

01:20:52.052 --> 01:20:54.496
MATT: Jamedi has essentially just swam around this
whole thing--

01:20:54.496 --> 01:20:59.561
TALIESIN: Asshole!

01:20:59.561 --> 01:21:03.740
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, Avantika
has, at this point, swept up and taken her turn

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:09.066
that she should have taken before and is going to
take three strikes against the malison. That's my

01:21:09.066 --> 01:21:18.255
own fault, but we'll see. With disadvantage.
That's cocked. That still hits because its armor

01:21:18.255 --> 01:21:26.593
class is only 12. Ten points of damage. Second
strike with the rapier, disadvantage. That does

01:21:26.593 --> 01:21:34.415
not hit! The dagger strike-- no. Misses again!
Swinging out, piercing through the water with the

01:21:34.415 --> 01:21:39.702
rapier and the dagger and just to scrape across
the side of its body but most of the strikes go

01:21:39.702 --> 01:21:43.841
wide and she's swimming around this way.

01:21:43.841 --> 01:21:46.275
TALIESIN: Is he going to take an attack of
opportunity on her?

01:21:46.275 --> 01:21:51.005
MATT: No, she's still staying in combat. She moved
around him but is staying engaged but is currently

01:21:51.005 --> 01:21:56.938
looking to make another opening and then dive off
back towards the stairs. Nott, sorry, your turn now.

01:21:57.243 --> 01:21:59.924
SAM: Okay, my turn. Do I need to first make a
constitution save?

01:21:59.924 --> 01:22:01.107
MATT: At the end of your turn.

01:22:01.107 --> 01:22:07.198
SAM: At the end of my turn, okay. I'll swim up and
poke the thing with my shortsword.

01:22:07.198 --> 01:22:12.278
MATT: You swim up a bit there. Go for it.
Disadvantage on the attack.

01:22:12.278 --> 01:22:17.410
SAM: Oh boy. Okay. What does this thing do? 15!

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:22.285
MATT: 15 hits, and engaged with allies. You do get
sneak attack damage.

01:22:22.285 --> 01:22:23.654
SAM: Oh? I do?!

01:22:23.654 --> 01:22:27.986
MATT: Yeah. It's engaged with Caduceus and
Avantika.

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:35.230
SAM: Oh wow. Okay. That's 21 points of damage.

01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:38.201
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:22:38.201 --> 01:22:47.702
SAM: Because it can't see me, I'll go up and-- I
don't use shortsword a lot, so I'll let it float

01:22:47.702 --> 01:22:53.796
for a second and grab it from behind and then rake
it across the back of its neck.

01:22:53.796 --> 01:22:58.644
MATT: As you do, you pierce past all the humanoid
muscles across the neck and its shoulders.

01:22:58.644 --> 01:23:03.987
Immediately, the water before you fills with
crimson. You can see it thrash for a minute, its

01:23:03.987 --> 01:23:10.151
serpent arms trying to reach behind to strike at
you. You swim away as they go limp, and it begins

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:15.553
to float up. So that's that. You still have a
little movement left.

01:23:15.553 --> 01:23:18.582
SAM: I'm going to go towards the door as much as I
can.

01:23:18.582 --> 01:23:23.579
MATT: That is about as far as you can get. With
dash, you can get up there so you're with Fjord.

01:23:23.579 --> 01:23:26.211
Make a constitution saving throw, please.

01:23:26.211 --> 01:23:29.520
SAM: Not great. 12.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:35.718
MATT: You are not drowning yet, but you're on the
cusp.

01:23:35.718 --> 01:23:39.794
SAM: That's my favorite condition: is not drowning
yet.

01:23:39.794 --> 01:23:44.728
MATT: That ends your go, Nott. Caduceus, Caleb,
and Jester, you're up.

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.614
TALIESIN: Full speed.

01:23:46.614 --> 01:23:49.730
TRAVIS: Yeah, the same with Jester. All the way up
to the dome.

01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:52.150
SAM: (Jester voice) She's going to cast Mending.

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:56.820
(laughter)

01:23:56.835 --> 01:24:00.419
MATT: She's up with Fjord, and I need you to make
a constitution saving throw for Jester.

01:24:01.011 --> 01:24:05.457
SAM: Seven plus-- nine.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:06.527
TRAVIS: 16!

01:24:06.527 --> 01:24:09.850
SAM: No. Seven plus two equals nine.

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:10.988
TRAVIS: Shit!

01:24:10.988 --> 01:24:14.482
MATT: Caduceus, I need you to make one too.
because you did cast a spell, Spirit Guardians,

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:15.783
while underwater.

01:24:15.783 --> 01:24:17.430
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. That's fair, I did.

01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:19.034
SAM: She rolled a nine.

01:24:19.034 --> 01:24:25.915
MATT: She rolled nine total. Jester's drowning.
You see her swimming. She's (choking) and begins

01:24:25.915 --> 01:24:28.735
kicking in the water before starting to--

01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:30.406
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight.

01:24:30.406 --> 01:24:35.356
MATT: You rolled an eight? Caduceus as well. They
both swim towards the staircase and you see them

01:24:35.356 --> 01:24:38.008
both beginning to clutch at their throats.

01:24:38.008 --> 01:24:42.074
TALIESIN: Can I cast-- I got a crazy idea.

01:24:42.074 --> 01:24:44.154
MATT: You used your full movement to get there.

01:24:44.154 --> 01:24:46.959
TALIESIN: Next turn can I try something?

01:24:46.959 --> 01:24:50.247
SAM: Next turn, you'll be dead.

01:24:50.247 --> 01:24:55.976
MATT: Next turn, you're going to be unconscious.
Ending your go, Caleb, what are you doing?

01:24:55.976 --> 01:25:01.830
LIAM: So I have three ways to move. First way is
the bonus action. Do I reach oxygen doing that?

01:25:03.106 --> 01:25:05.308
MATT: You can get up to the front there.

01:25:05.308 --> 01:25:06.975
LIAM: Does that get me to air?

01:25:06.975 --> 01:25:10.229
MATT: It gets you to the last bit of air as it's
about to hit the surface. At the end of this

01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:14.399
combat round, basically after Fjord, the chamber
that Beau is in is now full. The water has filled

01:25:14.399 --> 01:25:15.852
the entirety of the temple.

01:25:15.852 --> 01:25:17.822
LIAM: So all the way to the tippy-top?

01:25:17.822 --> 01:25:18.425
MATT: Yes.

01:25:18.425 --> 01:25:24.309
LIAM: Oh, balls. I'll use bonus action and
movement to go as high as I can. Do I reach the

01:25:24.309 --> 01:25:26.187
trap door?

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:28.467
MATT: You do reach the door.

01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:33.324
LIAM: I will pull out the wire from my spell
components and try to jimmy to lock. Oh god, I

01:25:33.324 --> 01:25:40.039
don't know what to do! I'm underwater, yeah? So I
still have action, so I'm going to try to open the lock.

01:25:40.058 --> 01:25:43.150
MATT: Okay. Make a lock picking attempt.

01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:45.475
SAM: This will be no problem, right?

01:25:45.939 --> 01:25:46.898
LIAM: Straight roll?

01:25:46.898 --> 01:25:49.855
MATT: No, disadvantage because you're underwater.

01:25:49.855 --> 01:25:57.504
LIAM: Oh, it's so good. Natural 20 and a three.
That's a four.

01:25:57.504 --> 01:26:03.323
MATT: No, that's a failure. You're sticking,
trying to get through it. No effect. Fjord, you're up.

01:26:03.323 --> 01:26:08.724
TRAVIS: Okay. Looking around, still having plenty
of air in my lungs, I turn around and see Jester

01:26:08.724 --> 01:26:14.945
starting to panic and I know that she has the key,
so I will reach out and grab her face and bring

01:26:14.945 --> 01:26:20.299
her into a kiss, and I will blow all of my air
into her lungs.

01:26:20.299 --> 01:26:23.382
SAM: Are you upside down right now?

01:26:23.382 --> 01:26:26.395
TRAVIS: Shape of Water!

01:26:26.395 --> 01:26:28.368
SAM: Oh, yes!

01:26:28.368 --> 01:26:32.541
MATT: She is no longer drowning, but you have to
make a con save at the end of your turn.

01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:34.308
TRAVIS: Okay. Fair enough.

01:26:34.308 --> 01:26:39.337
MATT: That's your action to do that. You breathe
some of your air into her. You still have movement.

01:26:39.919 --> 01:26:41.603
MARISHA: He selfishly wants the door unlocked--

01:26:41.603 --> 01:26:43.569
TRAVIS: I'll try and swim up towards the top.

01:26:43.569 --> 01:26:46.673
MATT: You make it halfway up. Actually, no,
because you have full move, don't you?

01:26:46.673 --> 01:26:47.712
TRAVIS: Full movement.

01:26:47.712 --> 01:26:50.370
MATT: You get almost to the top. Not fully, but
almost to the top. Constitution saving throw, please.

01:26:51.561 --> 01:26:53.690
TRAVIS: Nine.

01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:56.792
MATT: You, sir, are considered drowning.

01:26:56.792 --> 01:27:04.714
LIAM: I lost five of those hoo-has for casting a
spell, you said, so do I need to make a

01:27:04.714 --> 01:27:06.057
constitution throw?

01:27:06.057 --> 01:27:07.180
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.954
LIAM: Okay, let's all die together. 13.

01:27:09.954 --> 01:27:21.831
MATT: You're fine. That brings around to the top
there. Beau, the water fills the gap.

01:27:22.475 --> 01:27:27.248
MARISHA: Take one last deep breath. Going to drop
down and going to use that-- nope, the rope is

01:27:27.248 --> 01:27:30.274
attached to me. Going to drop down and see if I
can go for Jester.

01:27:30.274 --> 01:27:35.927
MATT: Okay. So you're going to pull Jester up?
She's conscious, so you're going to get her closer?

01:27:35.927 --> 01:27:38.219
MARISHA: Yeah, can I take her and yank her up with
me?

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:45.225
MATT: Sure. You go down. Takes you I'll say two
movements to get down there and you pull her part

01:27:45.225 --> 01:27:47.577
way up. Are you using your ki point for step of
the wind?

01:27:47.577 --> 01:27:49.259
MARISHA: Sure. My last ki point.

01:27:49.259 --> 01:27:53.691
MATT: Last ki point will do that. That will get
her halfway up the stairs because I'm saying

01:27:53.691 --> 01:27:58.978
pulling her, the dragging motion, is half
movement. So that will get you down to her. Yeah,

01:27:58.978 --> 01:28:02.691
you'll get her part way up the stairs, about
halfway up toward where the top chamber is.

01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:04.722
MARISHA: That helps. Whatever I can do, I guess.

01:28:04.722 --> 01:28:07.893
LIAM: If there was air where Beau was, wouldn't
there be air where Caleb was?

01:28:07.893 --> 01:28:10.094
MARISHA: No, you were below me, I think.

01:28:10.094 --> 01:28:16.354
LIAM: I'm hasted almost, and I just blasted up to
the top of the temple.

01:28:16.354 --> 01:28:19.189
MATT: It did. Okay, no. I would say that there was
enough air.

01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:21.510
LIAM: Then I would have (inhaling). Then I failed
the lock picking.

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:30.975
MATT: Thank you. So you're fine. Ends Beau's turn.
That brings us to Yasha. Avantika has also swam up

01:28:30.975 --> 01:28:38.512
and Jamedi is now gathering as well. Jamedi and
Avantika both grab Caduceus' body, who is

01:28:38.512 --> 01:28:41.049
drowning, and begin pulling him up the stairs
behind them.

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.581
MARISHA: That's good. That's nice of them.

01:28:43.581 --> 01:28:47.921
TRAVIS: Yasha will head towards the door and wait
for it to open. She's going to use her movement to

01:28:47.921 --> 01:28:48.779
go up.

01:28:48.779 --> 01:28:54.568
MATT: Yasha gets up there to the top. Yasha's now
in there, waiting there in the chamber. There's

01:28:54.697 --> 01:28:58.483
the gate below getting ready, looking around,
trying to get people to move upward. That finishes

01:28:58.483 --> 01:29:00.144
her go. Nott.

01:29:00.144 --> 01:29:05.922
SAM: I will grab Jester's horns and pull and go up
as fast as I can.

01:29:05.922 --> 01:29:14.258
MATT: You use half your movement to catch up to
Jester, where Beau is, and then you grab her with

01:29:14.258 --> 01:29:17.173
the little bit of movement. You move her an
additional five feet before your movement is done.

01:29:17.173 --> 01:29:19.279
You can attempt to bonus action dash.

01:29:19.279 --> 01:29:20.790
SAM: Bonus action dash. Sure, yeah.

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:25.075
MATT: You get another 15 feet. You get her near
the top of the staircase on the top floor. That

01:29:25.075 --> 01:29:30.111
ends your turn, Nott. Now it is Jester's, Caleb's,
and Caduceus' turn. Caduceus. You are unconscious.

01:29:31.488 --> 01:29:33.028
TALIESIN: I am unconscious. Ah, man!

01:29:33.028 --> 01:29:38.569
MATT: I need you to make a death save at the top
of your turn. I need to keep reminding myself that

01:29:38.569 --> 01:29:39.979
death saves are at the top of the turn, not in
the--

01:29:39.979 --> 01:29:43.546
TALIESIN: I know, I was just sitting on a spell
that apparently I didn't know that I was going to

01:29:43.546 --> 01:29:50.163
lose the spell so I'm throwing away my plans. I
had an emergency exit and now I can't use it. It's

01:29:50.163 --> 01:29:57.097
all right. Fuck it. 14.

01:29:57.097 --> 01:30:03.338
MATT: Success on the save. That finishes Caduceus'
turn. Caleb and Jester.

01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:07.889
LIAM: I'm taking a breath of air. Caleb would have
just rebounded back down and swam. I use bonus

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:12.295
action if that gets me to them, good. If not, I
will use bonus action plus movement to get to them

01:30:12.295 --> 01:30:16.961
which I would assume it would get me there. Then I
help Nott. I will continue to drag Jester up

01:30:16.961 --> 01:30:18.158
towards the surface.

01:30:18.158 --> 01:30:21.269
MATT: Between all of you guys, Jester and you all
manage to make your way up the top and Jester's

01:30:21.269 --> 01:30:27.101
turn-- Jester fumbles through her sack, pulls up
the key and gets it. So--

01:30:27.101 --> 01:30:28.515
SAM: So it works.

01:30:28.515 --> 01:30:32.430
MATT: This is how the ending of the first Poseidon
movie should have happened.

01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:33.946
(laughter)

01:30:33.946 --> 01:30:35.366
TRAVIS: First Poseidon movie, yeah!

01:30:35.366 --> 01:30:38.055
MATT: Because all of this water pressure just
built up at the top of this temple suddenly

01:30:38.055 --> 01:30:48.284
released as the latch and this geyser of water
thrusts all of you rapidly out the top.

01:30:48.284 --> 01:30:49.993
SAM: Money shot!

01:30:49.993 --> 01:30:51.827
MARISHA: (groaning) Oh god!

01:30:51.827 --> 01:30:57.573
MATT: You all get shot about a good 15, 20 feet
up.

01:30:57.573 --> 01:30:58.984
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

01:30:58.984 --> 01:31:06.163
MATT: You have a look down at the temple, which
you can now see these large cracks that have set

01:31:06.163 --> 01:31:11.355
in the sides where bits of water are pouring out
through small cracks. Now this large geyser thrusts

01:31:11.355 --> 01:31:14.242
in the air and you all began to plummet and fall.

01:31:14.242 --> 01:31:17.664
LIAM: I cast Feather Fall on myself, on Nott, on
Jester, on Beauregard, and on Fjord.

01:31:17.664 --> 01:31:18.668
MATT: Okay.

01:31:18.668 --> 01:31:20.228
LIAM: It's my last spell slot.

01:31:20.228 --> 01:31:21.709
MARISHA: Take Cad, take Cad! I'm good!

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:25.435
LIAM: I already did it, it doesn't matter. It's
what I did. It's who I know, not what hit points exist.

01:31:25.445 --> 01:31:27.380
SAM: I cast Feather Fall on everyone else.

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:30.351
(cheering)

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:33.200
TALIESIN: Thank god. That would have been the end
of me.

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.763
TRAVIS: That would have been it.

01:31:34.763 --> 01:31:38.541
TALIESIN: That would have been number two, done.
Right there, instant T.K.O.

01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:40.314
SAM: I throw a wet feather.

01:31:40.314 --> 01:31:42.970
(laughter)

01:31:42.970 --> 01:31:43.733
MATT: Perfect.

01:31:43.733 --> 01:31:45.163
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

01:31:45.163 --> 01:31:50.811
MATT: As you all begin to drift down, the geyser
slows, the pressure releases, but now water is

01:31:50.811 --> 01:31:57.855
just pouring out of the sides of the temple and
it's completely flooding the city. You watch as

01:31:57.855 --> 01:32:02.747
yuan-ti that are rushing up the side of the temple
are washed down into the basin that is now the

01:32:02.747 --> 01:32:07.984
center of the city streets. You can see now that
the city is being thrust up the side. Some have

01:32:07.984 --> 01:32:11.600
moved to the top of buildings and are glancing up
and seeing you guys as you begin to descend. Now

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.239
you're about to hit the top of this, and there is
now a perpetual flow of water coming out of the

01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:18.988
top of this temple. What are you going to do?

01:32:18.988 --> 01:32:22.198
SAM: We're about to hit the top of the temple, or
all the sides of it?

01:32:22.198 --> 01:32:26.520
MATT: On the sides of it. You guys are just slowly
drifting down towards what's essentially a raging--

01:32:27.766 --> 01:32:28.569
TRAVIS: Water slide?

01:32:28.569 --> 01:32:30.655
MATT: Rapid water slide on all ends.

01:32:30.655 --> 01:32:35.017
MARISHA: It ends with the mob of angry people who
want to kill us, probably?

01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:35.757
MATT: Correct.

01:32:35.757 --> 01:32:37.649
LIAM: I can see that.

01:32:37.649 --> 01:32:41.104
TALIESIN: Jester at the very least is going to
cast Spare the Dying-- is going to grab me in the

01:32:41.104 --> 01:32:42.825
Feather Fall and cast Spare the Dying.

01:32:42.825 --> 01:32:43.435
MATT: Okay.

01:32:43.435 --> 01:32:44.615
TALIESIN: Thank you!

01:32:44.615 --> 01:32:46.221
TRAVIS: I'm unconscious, I think.

01:32:46.221 --> 01:32:49.413
TALIESIN: I don't think you made it to
unconsciousness because we burst before your turn.

01:32:49.958 --> 01:32:50.756
TRAVIS: Okay, okay.

01:32:50.756 --> 01:32:52.094
SAM: No, you're unconscious.

01:32:52.094 --> 01:32:53.757
TRAVIS: I started drowning.

01:32:53.757 --> 01:32:54.431
MATT: Yeah.

01:32:54.431 --> 01:32:56.077
MARISHA: But I don't know if you're making death
saves. Is he stable?

01:32:56.077 --> 01:32:58.265
MATT: No, because we haven't gone to his turn yet.
You've begun drowning and you guys got thrust out,

01:32:58.265 --> 01:33:01.460
so you managed just catch your breath because it
didn't come back to your turn yet. That very next

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:05.216
turn, before Jester got it opened, you've would
have been down.

01:33:05.216 --> 01:33:06.197
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:33:06.197 --> 01:33:07.770
MATT: So you just caught your breath--

01:33:07.770 --> 01:33:08.961
TRAVIS: I did? Okay, okay.

01:33:08.961 --> 01:33:12.553
MATT: The very last minute. Basically, as the
darkness began to take your vision, you are thrust

01:33:12.553 --> 01:33:20.042
out and your eyes go wide again as you see this
sunlight above you as your air rushes back into

01:33:20.042 --> 01:33:24.894
your lungs and then suddenly begin to drift slowly
down looking below-- you can see the city and the

01:33:24.894 --> 01:33:28.886
entire landscape of this strange village below
you.

01:33:28.886 --> 01:33:30.928
MARISHA: How the fuck do we get out of this?

01:33:30.928 --> 01:33:32.432
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

01:33:32.432 --> 01:33:34.655
LIAM: They are on all sides, the people down
below, or are down on one side of them?

01:33:34.655 --> 01:33:37.289
MATT: They are on all sides. Like the entire city
surrounds the temple. You guys only came up on one

01:33:37.289 --> 01:33:39.999
side. The water is pouring down on all sides.

01:33:39.999 --> 01:33:41.858
TRAVIS: Let's us just get down and out of here.

01:33:41.858 --> 01:33:47.172
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I don't think that Spirit
Guardians doesn't go down when I go unconscious.

01:33:47.172 --> 01:33:49.153
MATT: Any spells that's concentration is lost.

01:33:49.153 --> 01:33:52.273
TALIESIN: It's not concentration-- Oh it is
concentration, isn't it? Where is it?

01:33:52.273 --> 01:33:54.981
Yeah, it is concentration. Fuck. God
damn it.

01:33:54.982 --> 01:33:56.876
TRAVIS: Let's just get back on the ship.

01:33:56.876 --> 01:33:59.861
LIAM: I'm paddling through the air towards the
direction we came from.

01:33:59.861 --> 01:34:00.687
MARISHA: Haul ass.

01:34:00.687 --> 01:34:04.310
SAM: As we're in the air, I'm going to take the
shield that I stole off my back, and slide it

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:05.973
under Caduceus' butt like a--

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:09.150
(laughter)

01:34:09.150 --> 01:34:14.956
SAM: A sled. Like a toboggan and hold it there so
when he lands he'll just slide.

01:34:14.956 --> 01:34:20.538
MATT: Okay. So as you all begin to slowly drift
and try paddling your way through the air, I'm

01:34:20.538 --> 01:34:24.972
going to say for the purpose of this, we'll make
this a group skill check. Everyone, make a

01:34:24.972 --> 01:34:30.670
dexterity check to try and comb your way through
the air enough. Using your body to try and guide

01:34:30.670 --> 01:34:32.086
your plummeting.

01:34:33.304 --> 01:34:33.900
TRAVIS: 12.

01:34:34.853 --> 01:34:35.998
MARISHA: 24.

01:34:35.998 --> 01:34:36.964
LIAM: Drei.

01:34:36.964 --> 01:34:38.654
SAM: It doesn't matter, you're out.

01:34:38.654 --> 01:34:40.123
MATT: Two successes, failure.

01:34:40.123 --> 01:34:41.608
TALIESIN: No I'm not, I'm unconscious.

01:34:41.608 --> 01:34:43.398
TALIESIN: I'm stable! That's right, I'm
unconscious! Never mind.

01:34:43.398 --> 01:34:44.088
MATT: You're fine.

01:34:44.088 --> 01:34:44.756
SAM: Natural 20.

01:34:44.756 --> 01:34:47.421
MATT: Success. Three successes, one failure.
Jester--

01:34:47.421 --> 01:34:49.075
SAM: 18 plus.

01:34:49.075 --> 01:34:51.739
MATT: Success on Jester. For Yasha?

01:34:51.739 --> 01:34:52.517
TRAVIS: 18.

01:34:52.517 --> 01:34:59.272
MATT: Success, all right! So only one fail. As a
group, that is a group success. So you all manage

01:34:59.272 --> 01:35:06.606
to just-- Yep, and both Jamedi and Avantika are
fine. So, you all manage to just barely push your

01:35:06.606 --> 01:35:08.344
way in a certain direction, you all begin to drift
down--

01:35:08.344 --> 01:35:10.789
SAM: Like a skydiving team?

01:35:10.789 --> 01:35:18.010
MATT: Yeah, slowly making your way through, until
eventually the surface of the water, the rushing

01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:23.716
sound gets louder and louder as you all strike it!
As you do, it carries you down in this rapid

01:35:23.716 --> 01:35:29.255
Goonies-style waterslide, you're all coasting down
the side of the stones, and elements of the stone

01:35:29.255 --> 01:35:33.983
just barely scraping and clipping the back of your
butt and your back and you're like "Oh god!", it's

01:35:33.983 --> 01:35:37.093
not enough to damage you but you're going to be
bruised as shit in the morning, but you're

01:35:37.093 --> 01:35:40.856
coasting down, you can see as the city is coming
towards you, the water is now pouring through and

01:35:40.856 --> 01:35:46.691
snaking through the city-- no pun intended-- there
are groups of yuan-ti that have clamored up onto

01:35:46.691 --> 01:35:50.338
the buildings and are currently trying to pull
themselves out of the water and help others get up

01:35:50.338 --> 01:35:56.221
out of the middle of this strange flood that has
taken over the center of their civilization.

01:35:56.221 --> 01:35:57.799
SAM: The water's still coming, right?

01:35:57.799 --> 01:35:59.462
MATT: It's still pouring out of the temple it
seems.

01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:01.479
SAM: Oh my god, the island is sinking.

01:36:01.479 --> 01:36:05.081
TRAVIS: Potentially, if this an island.

01:36:05.081 --> 01:36:07.397
SAM: It's a turtle's back!

01:36:07.397 --> 01:36:10.244
MARISHA: Turtle! It's only a turtle!

01:36:10.244 --> 01:36:12.824
SAM: It's the Cajun turtle!

01:36:12.824 --> 01:36:15.211
MATT: Orly's vengeance!

01:36:15.211 --> 01:36:17.035
TRAVIS: You fools!

01:36:17.035 --> 01:36:23.485
MATT: You guys coast down, you hit the bottom, and
you can see now where the water hits and it snakes

01:36:23.485 --> 01:36:26.373
through, it curves back to the right and the left,
which path are you going to try to guide towards?

01:36:26.373 --> 01:36:27.434
TRAVIS: Right!

01:36:27.434 --> 01:36:29.420
MATT: You have an unconscious, sledding furbolg.

01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:30.797
TALIESIN: You're sliding me, basically?

01:36:30.797 --> 01:36:34.495
SAM: I feel like I'm behind you because I've got
water walking on, so I'm like--

01:36:34.495 --> 01:36:37.195
MATT: You do it's like (brrrrrrrrr).

01:36:37.195 --> 01:36:39.186
LIAM: I have keen mind, I would call out exactly
the right way to go.

01:36:39.186 --> 01:36:41.206
MATT: It's almost like curling!

01:36:41.206 --> 01:36:43.574
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

01:36:43.574 --> 01:36:46.527
LIAM: I have keen mind, I would know the way that
would lead us towards the way we came.

01:36:46.527 --> 01:36:48.369
MATT: Yes you would, so you're guiding and
shouting directions?

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:50.755
LIAM: Ja! That way! Go that way!

01:36:50.755 --> 01:36:56.443
MATT: Caleb's guiding you guys, you guys move
around the side, riding the water. At this point

01:36:56.527 --> 01:37:03.932
the flood of water begins to subside a bit. It's
still guiding you through, but you can see now the

01:37:03.932 --> 01:37:08.658
initial burst and rushing of the rapids is not a
continuous thing, there is some sort of a tapering

01:37:08.658 --> 01:37:15.382
to it. You guys just managed to have been there
for the initial burst. At this point you guys

01:37:15.382 --> 01:37:18.945
coast around one side, come round and you're now
going down to the center of the street where you

01:37:18.945 --> 01:37:24.150
previously hid and basically like muscled two of
them into a doorway after stabbing and killing

01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:31.183
them rapidly. You're now gliding through the
street along with the flow of the water, trying to

01:37:31.183 --> 01:37:37.194
keep above the surface. Caduceus being pushed
along by little Nott, going (thudding). At this

01:37:37.194 --> 01:37:47.040
point, from one of the nearby building tops, you
see two of these centurion yuan-ti see you guys

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:54.403
pass beneath, begin giving out a call, and then
shouting over in their direction pointing towards

01:37:54.403 --> 01:38:02.924
you. Your presence is now aware to at least a
handful of nearby yuan-ti. Their weapons were

01:38:02.924 --> 01:38:06.739
either lost in the stream or not wielded of
course, but they're beginning to pull out their

01:38:06.739 --> 01:38:12.535
things. You guys continue to ride this forward,
you're leading the path, the way you can go. I

01:38:12.535 --> 01:38:17.423
need everybody to make a general acrobatics check
to try and guide their body through the water in

01:38:17.423 --> 01:38:20.273
the direction that Caleb is shouting. This is a
group check.

01:38:20.273 --> 01:38:21.571
MARISHA: Natural 20!

01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:25.886
TRAVIS: Natural 20! Yasha rolled a five.

01:38:25.886 --> 01:38:29.095
MATT: Those count as double successes.

01:38:29.095 --> 01:38:30.347
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

01:38:30.347 --> 01:38:31.750
LIAM: Unnatural 20.

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:32.790
MATT: Still good.

01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:36.423
SAM: 23, and Jester rolled a 23.

01:38:36.423 --> 01:38:39.743
MATT: You guys got this shit, like I don't even--
yeah, you're just out.

01:38:39.743 --> 01:38:45.601
SAM: Jester's been trying to make her way towards
him, if possible. Towards him, I don't know if she

01:38:45.601 --> 01:38:46.837
can get there.

01:38:46.837 --> 01:38:48.705
MATT: I think-- what did she roll?

01:38:48.705 --> 01:38:51.498
SAM: She rolled a 23. I mean she rolled a 19 plus
four.

01:38:51.498 --> 01:38:55.114
MATT: I'll say with that higher roll, she's been
able to make her way over towards the side of you

01:38:55.114 --> 01:38:56.899
guys, coasting along--

01:38:56.899 --> 01:38:59.494
TALIESIN: She doesn't actually have anything that
can wake me up right now.

01:38:59.494 --> 01:39:02.613
SAM: She does, she's trying to touch you so she
can cast Cure Wounds on you.

01:39:02.613 --> 01:39:06.379
TALIESIN: Oh my god, she has one left, doesn't
she? Holy shit, I forgot about that!

01:39:06.379 --> 01:39:10.728
MATT: All righty, so Jester just manages to just
make it over to the edge of you as the water,

01:39:10.728 --> 01:39:16.130
which was about maybe, with the flash flood about
three and a half, four feet deep, is now

01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:21.594
descending to about two foot. So some of you, your
feet manage to catch the floor beneath, but the

01:39:21.594 --> 01:39:24.964
water is still rushing rather fast, you can
continue to just go with the flow of it, or try

01:39:24.964 --> 01:39:30.311
and gather your footing, but it's up to you. You
can cast Cure Wounds on Caduceus.

01:39:30.311 --> 01:39:33.738
SAM: (as Jester) I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on
little man.

01:39:33.738 --> 01:39:34.915
MATT: A d4 plus--

01:39:34.915 --> 01:39:36.619
TALIESIN: I'm not even little anymore.

01:39:36.619 --> 01:39:38.428
SAM: (as Jester) You're always little to me.

01:39:38.428 --> 01:39:40.669
TALIESIN: Oh! I'm up, I'm up, oh!

01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:45.786
MATT: So go to roll d4 plus your wisdom modifier.
Sorry, d8 for Cure Wounds.

01:39:45.786 --> 01:39:49.638
SAM: You're right. One point plus four is five.

01:39:49.638 --> 01:39:53.296
MATT: You're at five hit points, you come into
consciousness, on a sled over water.

01:39:53.296 --> 01:39:55.378
TALIESIN: Did I lose all my hit points when I went
unconscious?

01:39:55.378 --> 01:40:01.575
MATT: Yes, when you're drowning it brings you to
zero hit points.

01:40:01.575 --> 01:40:05.357
TALIESIN: Okay, I had zero then. Well, fuck.

01:40:05.357 --> 01:40:11.621
MATT: Riding the water eventually you guys manage
to keep it going. Are you going with the water, or

01:40:11.621 --> 01:40:12.845
are you fighting it?

01:40:12.845 --> 01:40:14.325
MARISHA: Might as well go with the flow.

01:40:14.325 --> 01:40:16.018
SAM: Is the water going the way we want to go?

01:40:16.018 --> 01:40:16.866
MATT: Mostly, yeah.

01:40:16.866 --> 01:40:19.944
LIAM: Yeah, I would be calling out this whole time
which ways we want to go to get out, ja.

01:40:19.944 --> 01:40:24.484
MATT: So you just continue with the flow of it,
the flow eventually comes to a stop on the outside

01:40:24.484 --> 01:40:28.435
of the city, maybe about 15 or 20 feet from the
treeline where you first entered.

01:40:28.435 --> 01:40:29.550
TRAVIS: Got to go.

01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:30.581
MARISHA: Keep moving.

01:40:30.581 --> 01:40:33.281
TRAVIS: Caduceus in the front, everyone behind
him.

01:40:33.281 --> 01:40:38.675
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- really quickly since
I have nothing else left, I'm going to cast

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:43.607
Disguise Self and look like one of the lizard
people.

01:40:43.607 --> 01:40:44.648
MATT: Okay.

01:40:44.648 --> 01:40:47.178
TRAVIS: Yasha will be actually up front, just in
front of you.

01:40:47.178 --> 01:40:49.634
SAM: We need Caleb up front too, to guide us.

01:40:49.634 --> 01:40:52.494
MATT: As a note, all the makeup has been washed
off.

01:40:52.494 --> 01:40:54.302
TALIESIN: Oh, no!

01:40:54.302 --> 01:40:59.618
MATT: Sorry. As you guys are rushing towards the
treeline, you hear the shouting in the distance.

01:40:59.618 --> 01:41:02.479
You glance over, now that the water level has
stopped you can look behind, and you can see

01:41:02.479 --> 01:41:07.728
probably two dozen or so yuan-ti have now begun to
give chase. They're about a hundred feet behind

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:12.945
you, but they saw you exit and they're on their
way giving chase. Now we're turning this into a

01:41:12.945 --> 01:41:18.748
skill challenge chase as you guys are making your
way through. As you guys are now charging into the

01:41:18.748 --> 01:41:23.226
jungle, you're not doing stealth, so your speed
isn't as slow, which took you a day and a half or

01:41:23.226 --> 01:41:28.210
so to traverse this jungle to the center, unless
you want to keep stealthy, if it's charging through--

01:41:29.203 --> 01:41:29.750
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:30.427
MARISHA: Run.

01:41:30.427 --> 01:41:32.021
TRAVIS: Loudest thing you ever heard.

01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:33.723
LIAM: Raiders of the Lost Ark, we're just cutting
through the jungle.

01:41:33.723 --> 01:41:36.428
MATT: Full speed, great. We have six rounds of
this challenge.

01:41:36.428 --> 01:41:37.648
MARISHA: Six rounds?

01:41:37.648 --> 01:41:42.049
MATT: Correct, success and failure do different
things. Who wants to offer something to help in

01:41:42.049 --> 01:41:48.078
this skill challenge? Much like the resurrection
challenge in this game, think of a creative way

01:41:48.078 --> 01:41:49.880
that you can help your progression.

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.756
TRAVIS: Is it going to be dexterity checks?

01:41:51.756 --> 01:41:53.351
MATT: It depends on what you want to do.

01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:56.037
LIAM: Question, are we under 10 minutes since we
shot out the top of that pimple?

01:41:56.037 --> 01:41:57.703
MATT: You're still under 10 minutes, yes.

01:41:57.703 --> 01:42:02.658
LIAM: So I'm still sped up, and I'm going to run
at the front and just shout out directions and

01:42:02.658 --> 01:42:06.833
call out holes, things in the ground to look out
for. I'm going to lead the charge.

01:42:06.833 --> 01:42:11.712
MATT: Okay, I will say for that, make a survival
check with advantage.

01:42:11.712 --> 01:42:17.142
LIAM: Okay. Natural 20.

01:42:17.142 --> 01:42:25.874
MATT: That's one-- that's two successes on that
one! We'll add to that. So keeping a close eye,

01:42:26.062 --> 01:42:31.354
Caleb is darting ahead, into the jungle, shouting
out various issues. Jamedi is trying to keep up

01:42:31.354 --> 01:42:35.406
with you but behind is also helping you keep an
eye and shouting out traps that he had helped you

01:42:35.406 --> 01:42:38.964
bypass before and making sure you guys don't fall
off the path that you had made your way through

01:42:38.964 --> 01:42:45.005
that he had set on his map beforehand that had
avoided the bigger dangers in the jungle. Between

01:42:45.005 --> 01:42:51.533
the two of you, you manage to get a fair bit in
there, and the sound of the chasing yuan-ti does

01:42:51.533 --> 01:42:55.061
not seem to be getting louder, which is good.
That's one, who does the next offer?

01:42:55.061 --> 01:42:58.930
TRAVIS: I was going to say Yasha can take out the
Magician's Judge and start cleaving machete-style

01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:03.687
through the brush, making it far easier for us to
move.

01:43:03.687 --> 01:43:06.735
MATT: Okay, Yasha going to push at the front,
which, with a higher speed than you, she can

01:43:06.735 --> 01:43:12.907
definitely do, and begin to carve through swarths
of the jungle to make it an easier passage. For

01:43:12.907 --> 01:43:14.996
her, make an athletics check, please.

01:43:14.996 --> 01:43:16.414
TRAVIS: Advantage or straight up?

01:43:16.414 --> 01:43:18.552
MATT: Straight up, unless she's raging.

01:43:18.552 --> 01:43:21.176
TRAVIS: Oh, she's rage-clearing!

01:43:21.176 --> 01:43:23.654
MATT: Okay, I'll allow that for this.

01:43:23.654 --> 01:43:28.758
TRAVIS: 21-- 22.

01:43:28.758 --> 01:43:35.111
MATT: That's a success. Yasha's now ahead of the
group, she's carving through, you can see there

01:43:35.111 --> 01:43:39.909
are bits when you come up to the front, where
there is just dense clusters of tangled vines

01:43:39.909 --> 01:43:44.247
where the path you are taking-- Caleb stops you at
the front, because you deviated a little from the

01:43:44.247 --> 01:43:48.039
path where you were because you were running too
fast. At this point, you're not used to this level

01:43:48.039 --> 01:43:53.993
of acceleration for an extended period of time.
Right at the end of your Expeditious Retreat,

01:43:53.993 --> 01:43:57.190
right as the spell is about to fade, you come to
that group of vines. At that point you're about to

01:43:57.190 --> 01:44:02.226
spin and warn everybody, and all you see is this
blur of Yasha carve through them. They all fall to

01:44:02.226 --> 01:44:07.667
the ground, the path before you is open, she goes
"Go!" All of you just keep running in that

01:44:07.667 --> 01:44:10.522
direction. Yasha's continuing that, who's taking
the next bit?

01:44:10.522 --> 01:44:18.945
TALIESIN: I'll use Thaumaturgy to create the sound
of a rushing group of us, but throw it--

01:44:18.945 --> 01:44:23.277
happening, I'm going to move us off into the
jungle in the other direction. "You can create

01:44:23.277 --> 01:44:26.787
"instantaneous sound that originates from a point
of your choice within range--" This is a rumble,

01:44:26.787 --> 01:44:28.984
within 30 feet, a rumble of thunder--

01:44:28.984 --> 01:44:32.561
MATT: Yeah, rumble of thunder you can do, it has
limitations to the sound you can make, but you can

01:44:32.561 --> 01:44:34.165
make a rumble of thunder.

01:44:34.165 --> 01:44:38.521
TALIESIN: I can't make it the cry of a raven--
"such as" is what it says.

01:44:38.521 --> 01:44:42.996
MATT: Oh, "such as--" I misunderstood what you're
saying. Yeah, there are certain sounds you can

01:44:42.996 --> 01:44:44.974
make, the sound of a whole group--

01:44:44.974 --> 01:44:47.504
TALIESIN: I'm making the sound of people rummaging
through--

01:44:47.504 --> 01:44:49.416
MATT: Okay, so rustling in the bushes, it makes
sense.

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:52.141
TALIESIN: Yes, I'm pushing it away from us and
moving us in that direction.

01:44:52.141 --> 01:44:54.302
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:44:54.302 --> 01:44:58.062
TALIESIN: Come on, man, not some sucky stuff. Ah!
Not bad, 15.

01:44:58.062 --> 01:45:01.080
MATT: 15? That's just barely a success.

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.908
TALIESIN: I'll take just barely today.

01:45:03.908 --> 01:45:15.741
MATT: All right, so with that, you hear the
chanting sounds, the war cry of yuan-ti behind

01:45:15.968 --> 01:45:22.473
you, and it begins to divert slightly, getting
them off track just a little bit. All right, who's

01:45:22.473 --> 01:45:24.527
taking the next bit? Who hasn't offered one?

01:45:24.527 --> 01:45:26.462
TRAVIS: Oh there's six of these. I thought there
was three.

01:45:26.462 --> 01:45:28.346
MATT: There's six stages of this.

01:45:28.346 --> 01:45:30.227
SAM: Everyone has to have an offer?

01:45:30.227 --> 01:45:32.488
MARISHA: Is there anyone tracking us pretty
closely yet?

01:45:32.488 --> 01:45:37.832
MATT: From what you can tell, not at the moment,
but if you wanted to use your turn to do something

01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:45.372
to see if somebody is. What do you want to do?
Your crit earlier gave a lower DC for the next

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:48.306
check so that helped out tremendously.

01:45:48.306 --> 01:45:54.879
MARISHA: I'm going to take the rest of my ball
bearings and dump them out as we run.

01:45:54.879 --> 01:46:04.006
MATT: Okay. As a note, you're in a lush jungle--
Probably not going to do much on this, that's a

01:46:04.006 --> 01:46:08.499
hard, smooth floor type scenario. I mean, you can
if you want to.

01:46:08.499 --> 01:46:11.299
MARISHA: Nott, do you have anything you want to
offer?

01:46:11.299 --> 01:46:13.452
SAM: I have one thing, but--

01:46:13.452 --> 01:46:15.502
MARISHA: I don't know if any of my ideas are
good.

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:19.194
SAM: We don't have eyes on the yuan-ti, do we?

01:46:19.194 --> 01:46:20.918
MATT: No, not at the moment.

01:46:20.918 --> 01:46:26.834
SAM: I would wait until they get closer before I
do my thing. Maybe Jester can--

01:46:26.834 --> 01:46:29.416
TRAVIS: There's two dozen of them. I don't want to
get that close.

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:33.811
SAM: Well, I don't either, but if they do, I'd be
ready for something.

01:46:33.811 --> 01:46:38.455
TALIESIN: I have something else, but I'd be
curious if somebody else has something.

01:46:38.455 --> 01:46:45.095
MARISHA: I've got an oil flask. I could drop down
some fire but don't think it would work well either.

01:46:45.095 --> 01:47:02.652
SAM: Well sure, so I'll just yell to Beau: Beau!
Repeat after me, Fluffernutter! I'm going to throw

01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:04.939
the keg of gunpowder behind us.

01:47:04.939 --> 01:47:10.022
MARISHA: I go: Fluffernutter! and take my ninja
star and go (floof)!

01:47:10.022 --> 01:47:12.758
SAM: Wait, is it on fire? It has to be on fire!

01:47:12.758 --> 01:47:18.676
LIAM: I see it and use the Glove of Blasting to
fire three Scorching Rays.

01:47:18.676 --> 01:47:21.130
MARISHA: I don't have fire! I use my fists!

01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:23.462
LIAM: Three Scorching Rays.

01:47:23.462 --> 01:47:25.055
MATT: You have a second level spell to use?

01:47:25.055 --> 01:47:26.340
LIAM: No, the glove, I haven't used.

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:28.653
MATT: The glove? Yeah you do! That's right, okay.

01:47:30.943 --> 01:47:34.632
MARISHA: I could have used the bottle rockets.

01:47:34.632 --> 01:47:41.897
MATT: Okay, this is a combined maneuver here. I'd
say for the success of this, this is going to be a

01:47:42.098 --> 01:47:45.991
combination of your-- make a roll with your ranged
spell attack--

01:47:45.991 --> 01:47:47.731
LIAM: Yeah, there's three rays.

01:47:47.731 --> 01:47:51.085
MATT: Yeah, you can go ahead and make a general
strength roll.

01:47:51.085 --> 01:48:00.540
SAM: General strength? That was my nickname in
high school. 15.

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:07.611
MATT: Nice roll! Okay, you manage to lob it behind
with a fair amount of strength so it goes about

01:48:07.611 --> 01:48:09.484
ten, 15 feet behind you.

01:48:09.484 --> 01:48:15.156
SAM: Then if I can, I would push it with a little
Mage Hand, with a little extra top spin on it.

01:48:15.156 --> 01:48:22.447
MATT: Okay, it does a little whirl. It (whoof)
through the air and bounds a bit into the jungle

01:48:22.447 --> 01:48:23.815
behind you.

01:48:23.815 --> 01:48:25.869
LIAM: How do I handle this? Is this a skill
check?

01:48:25.869 --> 01:48:29.230
MATT: Are you detonating it just 15, 20 feet
behind you? Or are you waiting for something else

01:48:29.230 --> 01:48:30.113
to come out?

01:48:30.113 --> 01:48:32.165
LIAM: No, I'm just waiting for Nott to throwing it
back at them, yeah?

01:48:32.165 --> 01:48:34.649
MATT: Correct, but they're not visible yet though,
you don't know where you are.

01:48:34.649 --> 01:48:37.522
LIAM: Well I reacted to Fluffernutter being
shouted and seeing it--

01:48:37.522 --> 01:48:39.232
SAM: So blow it up! We'll make a wall of fire!

01:48:39.232 --> 01:48:41.469
LIAM: So I will track it and then hit it as it
struck the ground.

01:48:41.469 --> 01:48:42.797
MATT: Okay, what did you roll?

01:48:42.797 --> 01:48:46.715
LIAM: Well, I rolled three times, because there's
three rays. Do I use the spell modifier for this,

01:48:46.715 --> 01:48:47.460
or not?

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:48.336
MATT: You do.

01:48:48.336 --> 01:48:55.546
LIAM: Okay, so the highest roll was a 20, and then
the second highest was a 12, so probably of the

01:48:55.546 --> 01:48:57.240
three rays, probably only one--

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:01.315
MATT: What was the second one? Sorry, 20 and 12
were the two highest?

01:49:01.315 --> 01:49:04.023
LIAM: I rolled a 20, a 7 and a 12.

01:49:04.023 --> 01:49:08.366
MATT: Got you, okay. So the two hit, so roll
damage. The damage is going to be important here,

01:49:08.366 --> 01:49:15.225
because it is a waterlogged container of black
powder and may not be enough to truly ignite or

01:49:15.225 --> 01:49:18.181
cause an explosion here, or burn through the
barrel. We'll see.

01:49:18.181 --> 01:49:21.274
SAM: But the barrel you said was mostly intact?

01:49:21.274 --> 01:49:23.293
MATT: It's intact yeah, but it's wet.

01:49:23.293 --> 01:49:28.451
SAM: Yeah, but what about inside?

01:49:28.451 --> 01:49:31.259
MATT: It's soaked through a little bit.

01:49:31.259 --> 01:49:36.062
SAM: Barrels are waterproof, you keep beer in
them.

01:49:36.062 --> 01:49:38.174
MATT: This isn't a beer barrel.

01:49:38.174 --> 01:49:40.666
LIAM: Total of 12.

01:49:40.666 --> 01:49:49.966
MATT: That'll be enough. All right, so as it darts
behind, you watch the vision of Caleb spinning

01:49:49.966 --> 01:49:55.427
behind and releasing the glove in front with these
three arcs of flame. One of them hits a nearby

01:49:55.427 --> 01:50:00.241
bush and sets it aflame. The other two, one of
them hits the barrel and sends it arcing once

01:50:00.241 --> 01:50:06.891
more, and the second one hits; it detonates and
you guys feel this blast of hot wind behind you as

01:50:06.891 --> 01:50:11.972
your hair gets blown before your face. The entire
jungle around you lights for a moment with bright,

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:19.120
yellow-white light, and there in that space now is
a couple of trees that have now set aflame, and a

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:25.568
section of darkened crater on the ground where the
barrel was. The loud blast echoes across the

01:50:25.568 --> 01:50:27.292
jungle of the island around you.

01:50:27.292 --> 01:50:31.732
SAM: I just turn Beau around like, (shouting) That
was amazing! How did you do that with a throwing star?

01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:36.302
MARISHA: (shouting) I think these are magic
throwing stars! I think I bought magic throwing stars!

01:50:36.302 --> 01:50:43.440
MATT: I'll consider that a success. You guys keep
rushing. You assume, wherever the yuan-ti were,

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.045
they're a little unsettled by this large explosion
in the direction of where they're travelling, and

01:50:48.045 --> 01:50:52.932
it slows them down a bit as they try and coast
around the area where the damage is. However,

01:50:52.932 --> 01:50:58.760
there seems to be a lizardmen hunting party now,
that is in the jungle a little ways ahead of you.

01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.703
MARISHA: What? Oh jeez.

01:50:59.703 --> 01:51:01.095
SAM: This thing won't stop!

01:51:01.095 --> 01:51:09.363
MATT: You guys have been running for the better
part of two hours now; it's a ways through this

01:51:09.363 --> 01:51:14.312
jungle to get back to the shore. So first and
foremost, I need everyone here to go ahead and

01:51:14.312 --> 01:51:17.393
make a constitution saving throw, please.

01:51:17.393 --> 01:51:20.276
TALIESIN: My favorite saving throw.

01:51:20.276 --> 01:51:26.761
TRAVIS: 23 for Fjord, 20 for Yasha.

01:51:26.761 --> 01:51:28.028
MATT: Good.

01:51:28.028 --> 01:51:29.024
MARISHA: 11.

01:51:29.024 --> 01:51:30.106
MATT: Okay.

01:51:30.106 --> 01:51:30.901
LIAM: One.

01:51:30.901 --> 01:51:33.446
MATT: You take a point of exhaustion there,
Caleb.

01:51:33.446 --> 01:51:34.496
SAM: Ten.

01:51:34.496 --> 01:51:36.702
MATT: Just barely succeeded.

01:51:36.702 --> 01:51:39.174
SAM: Jester rolled an eight.

01:51:39.174 --> 01:51:40.894
MATT: One point of exhaustion.

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.350
SAM: Okay, conditions.

01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:43.448
TALIESIN: 18.

01:51:43.448 --> 01:51:46.030
MATT: All right, you're fine.

01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:47.833
TRAVIS: Jamedi?

01:51:47.833 --> 01:51:50.589
MATT: Avantika takes a point of exhaustion.

01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:51.953
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

01:51:51.953 --> 01:51:56.005
MATT: All right. You guys continue onward, since
you're just running through this jungle best you

01:51:56.005 --> 01:52:00.914
can, full sprint, it manages to keep ahead but
there is a threat of exhaustion as you continue to

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:09.785
move. So, you now begin to hear the sound, this
familiar clacking (guttural noises) sound of the

01:52:09.785 --> 01:52:12.350
lizardmen that you saw in the jungle before. Who's
doing what?

01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:14.323
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's amazing.

01:52:14.323 --> 01:52:15.673
SAM: We're still doing this?

01:52:15.673 --> 01:52:19.961
MATT: You're still doing it. You had four total
successes in the round, you had one critical

01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:21.071
success which improved--

01:52:21.071 --> 01:52:22.743
SAM: We hear a hunting party? We see a hunting
party?

01:52:22.743 --> 01:52:25.157
MATT: You don't see them there, but you hear them
in the direction you are. Apparently the noise and

01:52:25.157 --> 01:52:29.017
the explosion caught the attention of a nearby
lizardmen hunting party.

01:52:29.017 --> 01:52:34.750
MARISHA: I have these bottle rockets, if you can
Mage Hand them away and distract them away from us

01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:37.093
with another popping sound.

01:52:37.093 --> 01:52:38.980
SAM: And set them off at the same--

01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:42.777
MARISHA: Well, I can light them, you throw, and
you take it further.

01:52:42.777 --> 01:52:43.983
SAM: Sure.

01:52:43.983 --> 01:52:45.176
MARISHA: Okay.

01:52:45.176 --> 01:52:47.565
SAM: Sure? Yes!

01:52:47.565 --> 01:52:48.703
MARISHA: We'll call it--

01:52:48.703 --> 01:52:49.704
SAM: Let's do it!

01:52:49.704 --> 01:52:51.174
TALIESIN: Certainly not the weirdest.

01:52:51.174 --> 01:52:54.117
MATT: So you're doing the exact same thing with a
different item. It's going to have a higher DC but

01:52:54.117 --> 01:52:55.918
you can do it. It's your call.

01:52:55.918 --> 01:52:57.601
MARISHA: Well gee, when you put it like that.

01:52:57.601 --> 01:53:03.964
MATT: I'm just saying, it's something you can do.
You want to do it?

01:53:03.964 --> 01:53:07.008
MARISHA: I don't know, I feel deeply shamed by my
suggestion now.

01:53:07.008 --> 01:53:11.217
MATT: No no, it's a great suggestion! I'm just
letting you know, progressively doing the same

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:13.937
thing over and over again, it's going to continue
to raise the DC.

01:53:13.937 --> 01:53:22.206
SAM: You know, Jester hasn't done anything yet,
she still has a Thaumaturgy she could do. "You can

01:53:22.206 --> 01:53:28.497
"cause harmless tremors in the ground," but it
doesn't say where. Oh, "within 30 feet," yeah.

01:53:28.497 --> 01:53:29.968
That's no good.

01:53:29.968 --> 01:53:32.087
MATT: It's a cantrip. Cantrips don't have all that
power there.

01:53:32.087 --> 01:53:36.371
SAM: Yeah, they don't. Never mind, she uses it to
alter the appearance of her eyes for one minute.

01:53:36.371 --> 01:53:40.066
(laughter)

01:53:40.066 --> 01:53:41.470
SAM: She makes them black.

01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:43.598
MATT: There you go. Anybody else?

01:53:43.598 --> 01:53:48.923
TRAVIS: I can try to assume the form of one of the
lizard people in case they make eyes on us.

01:53:48.923 --> 01:53:50.009
MATT: Okay.

01:53:50.009 --> 01:53:51.625
TALIESIN: I've already done that as well.

01:53:51.625 --> 01:53:53.885
MATT: Two lizardfolk in the group now, all right.

01:53:53.885 --> 01:53:56.247
TRAVIS: I have no spell left to help.

01:53:56.247 --> 01:54:01.593
MATT: Doesn't have to be abilities, it can be just
whatever you think you would do in the area to help.

01:54:01.746 --> 01:54:03.953
MARISHA: I know, you just don't have a lot, you've
used all those things.

01:54:03.953 --> 01:54:07.563
SAM: I'm going to put up the cloak and just sneak.
We hear them?

01:54:07.563 --> 01:54:10.216
MATT: You heard the hunting call of them.

01:54:10.216 --> 01:54:12.146
SAM: In a direction that we can identify?

01:54:12.146 --> 01:54:16.225
MATT: Yes, somewhere in the front and to the right
of where you were as you guys were running through

01:54:16.225 --> 01:54:17.090
the jungle.

01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:20.340
SAM: Okay, I'll just say, stay here, and I'm going
to put up the hood and I'm going to dodge off in

01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:21.887
that direction stealthily.

01:54:21.887 --> 01:54:23.637
MATT: Okay, are you guys stopping for Nott, then?

01:54:23.637 --> 01:54:24.825
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:54:24.825 --> 01:54:26.097
MATT: Okay.

01:54:26.097 --> 01:54:27.727
SAM: Do I have to roll for stealth, I assume?

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:30.035
MATT: Yes you do, with advantage because of your
cloak.

01:54:30.035 --> 01:54:32.080
SAM: Okay, so that's 22.

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.946
MATT: Okay, so you are successfully stealthed,
this is not technically a success because this

01:54:35.946 --> 01:54:41.113
isn't actually helping the endeavor, but you do
manage to move ahead, and at your speed you come

01:54:41.113 --> 01:54:46.689
upon the hunting party. You can see now, there are
about six lizardmen with nets, shields, and spears

01:54:46.689 --> 01:54:51.244
that are currently making their way in the
direction of near where your party is currently

01:54:51.244 --> 01:54:55.708
waiting for you. The more time that passes, the
closer the yuan-ti get to your party.

01:54:55.708 --> 01:55:03.430
SAM: I'm going to cast Mage Hand. They're holding
nets and what else?

01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:09.227
MATT: Four of them have shields and spears, and
two of them have spears with nets, and the other

01:55:09.227 --> 01:55:14.321
ones have nets apparently tucked behind their
back. They're out here to catch and drag things back.

01:55:14.942 --> 01:55:23.527
SAM: Okay, Jesus, I got nothing, man. I'm just
going to try to Mage Hand and trip the guy in the

01:55:23.527 --> 01:55:27.429
back with his own net. Just pull it down a
little.

01:55:27.429 --> 01:55:29.296
MATT: Okay, make an arcana check.

01:55:29.296 --> 01:55:30.682
SAM: Arcana check?

01:55:30.682 --> 01:55:36.061
MATT: Yes. This is to see if you can influence the
magical nature of your cantrip strong enough to

01:55:36.061 --> 01:55:37.794
try and trip up one of them.

01:55:37.794 --> 01:55:40.868
SAM: Okay, arcana check is a 20.

01:55:40.868 --> 01:55:46.658
MATT: Okay, that's barely a success because that's
not a very effective plan, necessarily.

01:55:46.658 --> 01:55:55.382
SAM: Sure. Didn't know what else to do, but okay.

01:55:55.382 --> 01:56:02.020
MATT: One of them gets tripped up in the net and
the other ones look back at it and start clacking

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:06.321
at it and they're complaining about the one guy
that fell behind like an asshole and is slowing

01:56:06.321 --> 01:56:08.416
down their trajectory. Not a lot of distraction.
You can return, you figure you bought a little bit

01:56:08.416 --> 01:56:10.255
of time for your party but not much.

01:56:10.255 --> 01:56:11.138
SAM: Okay.

01:56:11.138 --> 01:56:12.105
MATT: Okay.

01:56:12.105 --> 01:56:18.458
SAM: I guess that's all I'll do. I don't know what
else to do! I-- You know what, I'm going to-- Fuck

01:56:18.458 --> 01:56:28.786
it! I'm going to cast Message and tell Caleb, go!
I'm going to go, hey fucktards, over here! and I'm

01:56:28.786 --> 01:56:30.528
going to just draw their attention.

01:56:30.528 --> 01:56:32.056
TRAVIS: Oh no.

01:56:32.056 --> 01:56:33.082
MATT: Okay.

01:56:33.082 --> 01:56:41.453
LIAM: I tell the group, she's doing something
stupid. She's distracting them, I have an idea but

01:56:41.453 --> 01:56:46.884
I don't want to leave her, let's go. I start
trudging through the jungle towards the direction

01:56:46.884 --> 01:56:47.842
I think is the right one.

01:56:47.842 --> 01:56:52.808
MATT: You all continue following Caleb. They are
now seemingly turning on you. (snarling)

01:56:52.808 --> 01:56:56.306
SAM: I'm going to bolt, double dash, fast as I can
go away.

01:56:56.306 --> 01:56:58.873
MATT: All right. You're darting through the
jungle--

01:56:58.873 --> 01:57:00.598
SAM: Not back towards my friends but like--

01:57:00.598 --> 01:57:02.000
MATT: Kind of in the adjacent direction.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:02.907
SAM: Perpendicular.

01:57:02.907 --> 01:57:05.245
MATT: Okay, no worries. They're giving chase,
they're following behind you, they know this

01:57:05.245 --> 01:57:11.852
jungle very well and can traverse it very easily.
However, you're quick, and you're small. For that,

01:57:11.852 --> 01:57:18.969
we'll say two of them throw ranged spears at you.
That's a 15 to hit?

01:57:18.969 --> 01:57:19.941
SAM: Nope.

01:57:19.941 --> 01:57:29.300
MATT: And a 12, nope. Both spears (impact) to the
nearby trees and you keep running trying to make

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.875
it through. Eventually, you hear the sound of--

01:57:31.875 --> 01:57:33.726
SAM: Drink run. Drink and run.

01:57:33.726 --> 01:57:37.320
MATT: Yeah, (gulping) as you're going. You hear
the footfalls breaking through of nearby brush and

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:42.713
glance over, afraid to see yuan-ti and you can see
the shapes of your group, maybe 25 or 30 or so

01:57:42.713 --> 01:57:44.556
feet to your left.

01:57:44.556 --> 01:57:48.722
LIAM: Are we able to tell the direction-- where
the lizardmen are, in relation to Nott, or just

01:57:48.722 --> 01:57:50.372
yuan-ti on us?

01:57:50.372 --> 01:57:53.385
MATT: Not at the moment, you guys are just
running. I mean, the lizardmen you knew were off

01:57:53.526 --> 01:57:56.726
to the front and right, and you guys darted at an
angle, and you're guiding them still in the

01:57:56.726 --> 01:57:57.812
direction toward the--

01:57:57.812 --> 01:58:01.659
LIAM: I'm saying, we all hear the yuan-ti or
Nott hears the yuan-ti coming?

01:58:01.659 --> 01:58:02.248
MATT: No.

01:58:02.248 --> 01:58:05.817
SAM: I saw you guys through the woods, but they're
behind me.

01:58:05.817 --> 01:58:08.989
MATT: Yeah, you haven't seen any of the yuan-ti,
you've gotten enough gain on them, but they've

01:58:08.989 --> 01:58:10.704
gotten a bit closer, but they haven't appeared
yet.

01:58:10.704 --> 01:58:15.744
LIAM: Okay, but I can tell the direction Nott is
running? Or moving?

01:58:15.744 --> 01:58:16.935
MATT: No, you're just--

01:58:16.935 --> 01:58:18.432
LIAM: You've seen us, we haven't seen you.

01:58:18.432 --> 01:58:19.060
SAM: Yeah.

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:19.793
MATT: Correct.

01:58:19.793 --> 01:58:20.502
LIAM: Never mind.

01:58:20.502 --> 01:58:23.840
MATT: You guys continue to run, continue to run,
continue to run-- Everyone, make another

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:25.894
constitution saving throw please.

01:58:25.894 --> 01:58:31.141
TALIESIN: (groaning)

01:58:31.141 --> 01:58:33.361
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:58:33.361 --> 01:58:35.752
TRAVIS: 12 for Fjord, nine for Yasha.

01:58:35.752 --> 01:58:40.748
MATT: Yasha takes a point of exhaustion, Fjord
barely succeeds. DC goes up by two every time we

01:58:40.748 --> 01:58:41.387
do this.

01:58:41.387 --> 01:58:42.413
TALIESIN: Oh fuck, really?

01:58:42.413 --> 01:58:43.470
MARISHA: 20, total?

01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:47.200
MATT: 20? Success. Secondary point of exhaustion,
your speed is now halved.

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.817
SAM: (whisper) Oh my god.

01:58:48.817 --> 01:58:53.398
MATT: Caleb is now winded, and now starting to
drag the group back a bit.

01:58:53.398 --> 01:58:58.020
SAM: One point of exhaustion, Jester succeeded, I
rolled a 14.

01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:01.543
TALIESIN: 16, she was 16. Ten.

01:59:01.543 --> 01:59:03.532
MATT: Ten, point of exhaustion, Caduceus.

01:59:03.532 --> 01:59:04.812
TALIESIN: I, yeah.

01:59:04.812 --> 01:59:07.762
MATT: Anyone who has one point of exhaustion, your
ability checks are at disadvantage right now.

01:59:07.762 --> 01:59:08.575
SAM: Damn.

01:59:08.575 --> 01:59:10.723
MATT: Two points, your speed is halved.

01:59:10.723 --> 01:59:12.417
TRAVIS: I remember that well.

01:59:12.417 --> 01:59:18.903
TALIESIN: I have the ability to carry a large
amount because of my size, can I piggyback and not

01:59:18.903 --> 01:59:22.232
get too much of a roll if I throw Caleb on my
back?

01:59:22.232 --> 01:59:25.831
MATT: I will make this one of your checks.

01:59:25.831 --> 01:59:26.742
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:59:26.742 --> 01:59:28.424
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:59:28.424 --> 01:59:29.337
TALIESIN: Oh man.

01:59:29.337 --> 01:59:30.327
MATT: You have disadvantage because--

01:59:30.327 --> 01:59:32.114
TRAVIS: Or you could have Yasha do it.

01:59:32.114 --> 01:59:36.901
TALIESIN: I'll have Ya-- yeah, no, that's a better
idea, because I was-- five hit points, maybe not.

01:59:36.901 --> 01:59:39.900
MATT: Okay, so you share the idea with Yasha,
Yasha's going to attempt to--

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:41.499
TRAVIS: Athletics?

01:59:41.499 --> 01:59:43.326
MATT: Does Yasha have a point of exhaustion?

01:59:43.326 --> 01:59:44.269
TRAVIS: She does.

01:59:44.269 --> 01:59:46.471
MATT: So disadvantage on her athletics check.

01:59:46.471 --> 01:59:47.660
MARISHA: I want to--

01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:49.451
TRAVIS: It's her biggest modifier.

01:59:49.451 --> 01:59:52.110
MATT: One second please, because this is going to
attribute to her--

01:59:52.110 --> 01:59:54.411
TRAVIS: Oh, a natural 20 and a 12, so that's 19.

01:59:54.411 --> 01:59:56.800
MATT: 19! That's a success.

01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:00.084
TALIESIN: (sigh of relief)

02:00:00.084 --> 02:00:02.540
MATT: That puts us at six total successes--

02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:04.215
TALIESIN: Oh my god--

02:00:04.215 --> 02:00:05.484
MARISHA: We're all clear?

02:00:05.484 --> 02:00:08.738
MATT: --across the checks here. Yasha throws Caleb
fireman-carry over the shoulder and you guys begin

02:00:08.738 --> 02:00:12.320
running and running and running. For this next
additional hour now, as you guys are charging

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:15.748
through, following the path, we'll say you've gone
three or four hours of straight sprint through the

02:00:15.748 --> 02:00:21.895
forest. Sprint, stop, run. You're breathing heavy,
you're sweating profusely, your body is aching,

02:00:21.895 --> 02:00:29.492
your mouth is just filled with the worst
cottonmouth, you're dehydrated. You can hear the

02:00:29.492 --> 02:00:36.769
yelping of approaching lizardmen and yuan-ti as
you see the light begin to slowly break ahead of

02:00:36.769 --> 02:00:42.096
you, through the trees as the treeline begins to
thin, and the faintest bit of blue is visible.

02:00:42.096 --> 02:00:47.005
Within a few more moments, you break through the
treeline and you've found yourself back to the

02:00:47.005 --> 02:00:56.341
white sand beaches of Urukaxl. There, as you come
out to the sand, the hot reflection of the sun

02:00:56.341 --> 02:01:01.789
against the light. You can see now the sun is
close to setting at this point, the sky itself has

02:01:01.789 --> 02:01:06.991
gotten slowly darker as you've moved past. The
white beaches have now come to a faint dull yellow

02:01:06.991 --> 02:01:14.049
and orange with the coming sunset light. Nott
emerges from the nearby brush.

02:01:14.049 --> 02:01:15.395
SAM: (panting)

02:01:15.395 --> 02:01:16.895
MATT: She's catching up with the rest of you
guys.

02:01:16.895 --> 02:01:18.052
SAM: (panting) I'm exhausted.

02:01:18.052 --> 02:01:20.701
TRAVIS: On the ship! On the ship!

02:01:20.701 --> 02:01:22.460
SAM: They're right behind me!

02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:27.599
MATT: You guys look and there are the two rowboats
that are still right where you left them.

02:01:27.599 --> 02:01:31.553
LIAM: Yasha's moving towards the beach, Caleb's
going to just start firing Firebolt after Firebolt

02:01:31.553 --> 02:01:36.198
at the treeline, I've a 120 foot range, and is
going to set the jungle on fire behind us.

02:01:36.198 --> 02:01:44.258
MATT: Okay-- I will say, roll an arcana check for
me.

02:01:44.258 --> 02:01:46.996
LIAM: Natural one.

02:01:46.996 --> 02:01:55.008
MATT: Unfortunately, as a cantrip, the perpetual
fiery quality of it, it can do bursts of damage

02:01:55.008 --> 02:02:01.025
and plops of flame but unfortunately, the treeline
here is too humid, the air here is too wet and

02:02:01.025 --> 02:02:07.670
none of the trees are catching. However, you
manage to get over, Yasha throws you onto one of

02:02:07.670 --> 02:02:11.734
the two rowboats, you guys get on, too. At this
point, you can now see, breaching one side of the

02:02:11.734 --> 02:02:17.102
treeline, the yuan-ti, the other side, a group of
lizardmen. They come to a head and look at each

02:02:17.102 --> 02:02:21.651
other and look at you. Half of each group charges
at each other--

02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:22.530
SAM: Oh yes!

02:02:22.530 --> 02:02:24.656
MATT: --while the other half begins to charge
towards the rowboats.

02:02:24.656 --> 02:02:25.952
TRAVIS: (groaning) Oh fuck.

02:02:25.952 --> 02:02:26.885
MARISHA: At the rowboat?

02:02:26.885 --> 02:02:28.816
SAM: Start the motor, start the motor!

02:02:28.816 --> 02:02:29.846
SAM: (ripcord noises)

02:02:29.846 --> 02:02:31.680
MARISHA: How close are they?

02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:34.561
MATT: They're about 40 feet away, it's a 40 foot
rush.

02:02:34.561 --> 02:02:37.941
MATT: They're going to catch up-- You guys push
off and you're rowing out, you're about ten now,

02:02:37.941 --> 02:02:42.101
15 or 20 feet off the edge, they catch up, they
start getting their shortbows ready. At this

02:02:42.101 --> 02:02:45.269
point, you hear (cannon fire)

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:46.672
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:02:46.672 --> 02:02:47.616
TALIESIN: Oh thank god--

02:02:47.616 --> 02:02:48.422
TRAVIS: Volley that shit.

02:02:48.422 --> 02:02:52.108
MATT: (cannon fire) Bursts of sand, columns of
sand go flying into the air, and you watch as one

02:02:52.108 --> 02:02:57.061
lizardman (scream), a yuan-ti bursts off to the
side. You look over, you can see the flashes of

02:02:57.061 --> 02:03:00.142
light on the sides of the Squalleater--

02:03:00.142 --> 02:03:01.740
TRAVIS: Oh, so sick!

02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:03.672
MATT: --as volley after
volley of cannon fire is blown towards the edge of

02:03:03.672 --> 02:03:10.279
the shoreline. A couple close calls, as it's not a
perfect aiming implement. You see as-- you dodge

02:03:10.279 --> 02:03:14.313
out of the way as (splashing) big burst of water.
Some of the yuan-ti dive into the water and are

02:03:14.313 --> 02:03:18.445
now swimming through, trying to come back-- you
can see their serpentine bodies making their way

02:03:18.445 --> 02:03:19.680
in your direction.

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:21.636
TRAVIS: Caleb and I are picking them off, Eldritch
Blast and--

02:03:21.636 --> 02:03:22.324
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:03:22.324 --> 02:03:24.282
MATT: Hitting in the water as you do.

02:03:24.282 --> 02:03:27.727
MARISHA: I'm on the edge, doing polearm duty, like
croc hunting.

02:03:27.727 --> 02:03:28.856
TRAVIS: No! No!

02:03:28.856 --> 02:03:30.197
MARISHA: (grunting)

02:03:30.197 --> 02:03:31.198
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just--

02:03:31.198 --> 02:03:35.147
MATT: Eventually, you guys get far enough away
from the edge, it becomes less advantageous for

02:03:35.147 --> 02:03:40.497
them to focus on you and than to focus each other.
Through the cacophony of explosions and the rest

02:03:40.497 --> 02:03:46.348
are wrestling the much larger force of both the
lizardpeople that live on this island and the

02:03:46.348 --> 02:03:50.885
yuan-ti that have given chase are now focused on
each other and this conflict is now spilling back

02:03:50.885 --> 02:03:59.182
into the jungle and away from the beach. As you
all, very sore, make your way towards the

02:03:59.182 --> 02:04:04.871
Squalleater, and now you can see, offshore, The
Mist, or The Mistake, has also been pulled off the

02:04:04.871 --> 02:04:10.886
shore, seemingly repaired enough to be at least
semi-serviceable, though it's only been a day or

02:04:10.886 --> 02:04:17.899
so and the repairs probably aren't long-haul
permanent, but for the first time, in a very, very

02:04:17.899 --> 02:04:26.997
long time this day, you all take a deep breath,
some of you taking a short nap, as you row

02:04:26.997 --> 02:04:36.246
yourself to the sunset over the distant far shores
of the ocean, towards the ships that mean safety--

02:04:36.246 --> 02:04:37.490
and that's where we're going to take a break.

02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:38.663
(groaning)

02:04:38.663 --> 02:04:39.446
SAM: Oh my god.

02:04:39.446 --> 02:04:42.810
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Why did we not take a short
rest right when we started! (laughter)

02:04:43.562 --> 02:04:45.228
SAM: You're the one who-- it's your thing!

02:04:45.228 --> 02:04:46.546
TRAVIS: I know, I know!

02:04:46.546 --> 02:04:48.980
I didn't think about it, damn it!

02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:50.842
MARISHA: Yeah. Not feeling that whole time.

02:04:50.842 --> 02:04:52.013
TRAVIS: That was gnarly!

02:04:52.598 --> 02:04:56.746
TRAVIS: Dude, you're good, you're good, you're
good. Water is your friend, you're good.

02:04:56.746 --> 02:04:58.884
TALIESIN: This is, yeah. That was a lot.

02:04:58.884 --> 02:05:01.801
(laughter)

02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:03.999
MATT: Okay then, damn!

02:05:03.999 --> 02:05:06.005
MARISHA: I've never felt more useless.

02:05:06.005 --> 02:05:07.664
TRAVIS: Oh fuck me.

02:05:07.664 --> 02:05:08.987
SAM: Magical prime time.

02:05:08.987 --> 02:05:10.210
TRAVIS: That was a teacher.

02:05:10.210 --> 02:05:11.007
MARISHA: Curse you!

02:05:11.007 --> 02:05:11.969
TRAVIS: That was a teacher.

02:05:11.969 --> 02:05:13.636
SAM: Do we really only have mutterfingers--

02:05:13.636 --> 02:05:16.093
TALIESIN: It's only a teacher if we actually learn
from these mistakes--

02:05:16.093 --> 02:05:17.657
SAM: --blob boffers, and words?

02:05:17.667 --> 02:05:19.556
TRAVIS: No, there's also smudge and--

02:05:19.556 --> 02:05:22.145
TALIESIN: I have a giant pile of stuff in the
other room

02:05:22.145 --> 02:05:24.416
SAM: I want Meese's Meanutmutter Mubs!

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:26.396
(laughter)

02:05:26.559 --> 02:05:28.584
LIAM: It's all they had at Smogschmeade!

02:05:28.584 --> 02:05:30.660
SAM: I don't even know what that means.

02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:35.475
MATT: I don't either. Anyway! Friends, we're going
to go to our break here in just a moment, we'll

02:05:35.475 --> 02:05:39.959
return but in the meantime, we have another
Wyrmwood giveaway. This fantastic, delightful

02:05:39.959 --> 02:05:44.535
padauk dice vault, which is magnetized, opens up
to keep all your dice, possibly even a couple

02:05:44.535 --> 02:05:49.569
miniatures in there, well-kept, beautiful orange
color for the Halloween season that we're still

02:05:49.569 --> 02:05:51.209
celebrating today, damn it!

02:05:51.209 --> 02:05:52.487
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:05:52.487 --> 02:05:55.693
MATT: So, to enter this, you need to jump over to
the Critical Role Twitch chat, that's

02:05:55.693 --> 02:06:03.397
twitch.tv/criticalrole, and enter the keyword

02:06:03.397 --> 02:06:06.400
back at the break for a winner, once again, only
people in the United States and Canada, excluding

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:11.816
Quebec, can enter, we're working on it. But. We'll
come back with a winner here in just a moment so

02:06:11.816 --> 02:06:13.931
sit tight, be right back.

02:06:13.931 --> 02:06:16.419
MATT: And welcome back everybody--

02:06:16.419 --> 02:06:18.810
(singing)

02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:26.922
MATT: (laughter) So. We have a winner of the
fantastic padauk dice vault, I believe that's how

02:06:26.922 --> 02:06:33.236
it's pronounced, or not. I might be messing it up.
But. Regardless, the winner is fmiller8. fmiller8,

02:06:33.236 --> 02:06:34.282
congratulations--

02:06:34.282 --> 02:06:35.570
TRAVIS: fmiller8, yeah, man!

02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:38.124
MATT: We'll get this vault sent out to you ASAP.

02:06:38.124 --> 02:06:40.898
(cheering)

02:06:40.898 --> 02:06:41.682
MATT: All right.

02:06:41.682 --> 02:06:43.131
TALIESIN: Can we ever not look?

02:06:43.131 --> 02:06:45.706
TRAVIS: Can we just automatically get a short
rest, just because that was the most--

02:06:45.706 --> 02:06:47.548
MARISHA: Yeah, do we just collapse--

02:06:47.548 --> 02:06:48.841
TRAVIS: heinous, strenuous--

02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:50.679
MARISHA: of exhaustion as soon as we hit the
deck?

02:06:50.679 --> 02:06:51.452
MATT: Nope.

02:06:51.452 --> 02:06:52.320
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:56.864
MATT: Because you're rowing to the ship and
there's still the occasional (cannon fire) of the

02:06:56.864 --> 02:07:05.330
final shots sent off to deflect any interest in
following or pursuing you towards the boats. As

02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:09.558
you guys are trying to make some distance here,
you look over at Avantika, who has her one

02:07:09.558 --> 02:07:15.125
ungloved hand, you can see the gap where the open
wound, there's just a little bit of blood

02:07:15.125 --> 02:07:22.571
trickling down her forearm where the eye once was.
She looks at it, closes her fist, closes her eyes,

02:07:22.571 --> 02:07:30.402
and you feel the rowboat suddenly pick up speed,
and you watch as the water and the waves now give

02:07:30.402 --> 02:07:35.719
an additional thrust like the ocean itself is
rising and pushing the boat forward and you watch

02:07:35.719 --> 02:07:42.362
Avantika open her eyes and smile and looks over at
Fjord and goes, "Well, better luck next time,

02:07:42.362 --> 02:07:50.464
huh?" The boat is now speedboating across the
surface of the water, the other rowboat left

02:07:50.464 --> 02:07:52.705
behind in its wake.

02:07:52.705 --> 02:07:55.334
LIAM: One die roll, man. One die roll.

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:57.401
MATT: One die roll.

02:07:57.401 --> 02:08:01.040
LIAM: (high-pitched) I said bi--

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:07.973
MATT: (laughter) As you approach the outskirts of
the Squalleater. The rope ladders are thrown over

02:08:07.973 --> 02:08:14.082
the edge, down into the water. With that, you all
eventually climb up onto the top as some of the

02:08:14.082 --> 02:08:20.440
crew goes over to retrieve and ratchet up and
bring the rowboats back onto the ship. Now you all

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:28.164
clamber onto the deck of the large ship and take a
moment of respite and breather as your-- the crew

02:08:28.164 --> 02:08:35.894
of the Squalleater there awaits. You can see there
Bouldergut, the large ogre chief, stands there, arms

02:08:35.894 --> 02:08:45.781
crossed, with the stretched leather tunic now
strapped on each side of her torso. Avantika rises and

02:08:45.781 --> 02:08:56.520
Vera waits, her right-hand, soothsayer-like
assistant, or for this, would be considered the

02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:02.067
deckhand and spiritual leader of this ship.

02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:04.268
SAM: Can I pause you for one second, Matt?

02:09:04.446 --> 02:09:05.248
MATT: Yes, you may.

02:09:05.248 --> 02:09:08.186
SAM: Did you all fucking take off your costumes?

02:09:08.186 --> 02:09:10.113
MARISHA: Yeah...

02:09:10.113 --> 02:09:11.329
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:09:11.329 --> 02:09:13.130
TRAVIS: No, we're still wearing ours. Are--

02:09:13.130 --> 02:09:15.117
LIAM: Is that super-glued on or something?

02:09:15.117 --> 02:09:15.886
SAM: No!

02:09:15.886 --> 02:09:17.240
MATT: I took mine off.

02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:18.443
SAM: That I saw.

02:09:18.443 --> 02:09:22.290
(laughter)

02:09:22.290 --> 02:09:23.574
MARISHA: It got uncomfortable--

02:09:23.574 --> 02:09:24.566
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

02:09:24.566 --> 02:09:25.696
TRAVIS: It was bad luck.

02:09:25.696 --> 02:09:28.135
MARISHA: You have clothes underneath your--
fiber!

02:09:28.135 --> 02:09:29.944
SAM: Do I?

02:09:29.944 --> 02:09:34.573
MATT: (laughter) That's true, if there was any of
us I would not be able to truly--

02:09:34.573 --> 02:09:36.054
TRAVIS: Uh huh.

02:09:36.054 --> 02:09:37.423
MATT: be certain--

02:09:37.423 --> 02:09:39.235
TRAVIS: There are imprints being left on that
chair.

02:09:39.235 --> 02:09:40.049
MATT: Yeah.

02:09:40.049 --> 02:09:42.391
(laughter)

02:09:42.391 --> 02:09:46.388
SAM: Sticky butt. Peel off, peel off.

02:09:46.388 --> 02:09:47.678
MARISHA: Little hearts!

02:09:47.678 --> 02:09:49.976
SAM: Sorry, Matt.

02:09:49.976 --> 02:09:59.595
MATT: It's okay. So, as you all bring yourselves
onto the ship here, Vera approaches Avantika and

02:09:59.595 --> 02:10:12.553
helps her to her feet and says like "So, how did
it go? Tell us." Avantika shows her hand, "Twas a

02:10:12.553 --> 02:10:20.975
"resounding success. I would say that our new
compatriots have proven their worth with flying

02:10:20.975 --> 02:10:25.837
"colors." She goes and gives a (clapping) ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow--

02:10:25.837 --> 02:10:30.807
(laughter)

02:10:30.807 --> 02:10:37.355
MATT: "And I do believe," You see Jamedi sitting
on the ground, and goes, "Yes?" "You have earned

02:10:37.355 --> 02:10:45.681
"what our contract assured you. Please, Vera, if
you could retrieve the payment." Vera leaves and

02:10:45.681 --> 02:10:50.572
in a moment, comes back with a small chest and
hands it over to Jamedi, who sets it into his

02:10:50.572 --> 02:11:01.242
pouch and satchel. He stands up for a second, nods
his head, "I hope you understand, that with all

02:11:01.242 --> 02:11:07.956
"due respect, this is our last time working
together." The Captain says, "Aye, I understand,

02:11:07.956 --> 02:11:13.993
"but it is your loss. There is always more work for
you. Where would you like to be dropped off?"

02:11:13.993 --> 02:11:16.278
SAM: In a graveyard.

02:11:16.278 --> 02:11:28.730
MATT: At this point Vera says, "Captain, at this
moment, it appears that we have maybe 11 days of

02:11:28.968 --> 02:11:36.417
"supplies, given that our crew has now swelled. As
such, we could probably make it back to Darktow to

02:11:36.417 --> 02:11:44.283
"also complete the repairs on The Mist, as it is
seaworthy, but I do not know how long. So that

02:11:44.283 --> 02:11:51.240
"would be my recommendation. Maybe making a stop or
two along the way, whatever's close by." The

02:11:51.240 --> 02:12:00.321
"captain considers. "Very well, I guess we'll make
our way westward onto Darktow to get repairs done,

02:12:00.321 --> 02:12:11.549
"to supply up, and should you wish to stay, make
our way to the next leg of our journey. Who knows?

02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:18.640
"It seems that you are up for your own rewards to
be reaped, eh?"

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:28.935
TRAVIS: Indeed. Such a mighty display on the way
back, I feel like I would be left wanting if I

02:12:28.935 --> 02:12:31.825
didn't try and pursue the same sort of glory.

02:12:31.825 --> 02:12:42.803
MATT: "Of course. Well, these gifts are paltry.
Once Uk'otoa is truly free, then the true blessing

02:12:42.803 --> 02:12:44.256
"can be given."

02:12:44.256 --> 02:12:51.892
TRAVIS: Captain, may I ask, you knew of this
location already. Do you have a lead on another?

02:12:51.892 --> 02:12:58.025
MATT: "I have a lead on someone that should be in
Darktow that would be able to-- with the right

02:12:58.025 --> 02:13:06.626
"amount of coin-- give us the information we seek.
Hopefully. If not, we'll be sitting here with our

02:13:06.626 --> 02:13:12.342
"thumbs up our asses, but I've paid well enough,
and this person has come through before, so

02:13:12.342 --> 02:13:13.846
"fingers crossed, eh?"

02:13:13.846 --> 02:13:15.145
TRAVIS: Indeed.

02:13:15.145 --> 02:13:21.721
MATT: "Regardless, I think we could all use a bit
of rest, eh?" Looks over to Caduceus.

02:13:21.721 --> 02:13:27.434
TALIESIN: I would be amenable at this point.

02:13:27.434 --> 02:13:35.049
MATT: "Understood. Get Jeremiah to get food
cooking immediately. I think a fine meal and a

02:13:35.248 --> 02:13:47.254
full night's rest is in order. Friends, I'm
impressed, and I'm thankful that you've not only

02:13:47.254 --> 02:13:55.775
upheld your side of the bargain, you proved
yourselves as quite formidable mercenaries. I mean

02:13:55.775 --> 02:14:03.561
no disrespect to some of my crew, but when we get
back to Darktow--" She looks at some of the crew.

02:14:03.561 --> 02:14:10.807
"Turn around." Some of them-- "Maybe we'll deal
with some trade off, eh? Send some of them over to

02:14:10.807 --> 02:14:13.842
The Mist and maybe you'll stay with me for a
while."

02:14:13.842 --> 02:14:23.061
TRAVIS: We would certainly entertain that very
notion. It's hard to think past any sort of a rest.

02:14:23.070 --> 02:14:28.832
MARISHA: Sorry, I thought that was hypothetical
and that we were-- talk about that later, which we

02:14:28.832 --> 02:14:30.486
should do.

02:14:30.486 --> 02:14:38.607
MATT: "Very well. Then we will get some sleep and
on the morrow we will discuss how much money we

02:14:38.607 --> 02:14:45.632
can make together. We'll probably make a stop or
two along the way, if you're interested. Bring up

02:14:45.632 --> 02:14:51.253
the map and see what you want to do. When we've
had a bit of rest, maybe a glass of wine."

02:14:51.253 --> 02:14:53.029
TRAVIS: Of course.

02:14:53.029 --> 02:15:04.240
MATT: "All right. Go, rest, sleep. I shall do the
same." She walks back into her quarters, Vera

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:10.852
staying there on the deck. Jamedi makes his way
down to his quarters. What would you like to do?

02:15:10.852 --> 02:15:13.324
SAM: Go to our quarters, I guess?

02:15:13.324 --> 02:15:22.576
TRAVIS: Could we have a conversation near the bow
of the ship, perhaps? Away from ears? Is it empty

02:15:22.576 --> 02:15:24.339
towards the bow?

02:15:24.339 --> 02:15:28.310
MATT: You can find a bit that seems a little more
remote, but there are deckhands; there are folks

02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:30.718
that are always keeping watch.

02:15:30.718 --> 02:15:36.155
MARISHA: I'll be right back. You guys find a spot,
I'll meet you there. I go back and I go,

02:15:36.155 --> 02:15:42.076
Jeremiah! Give me that. I take bread or whatever
he has prepared.

02:15:42.076 --> 02:15:49.257
MATT: You come to Jeremiah. You eventually start
shouting until you find Jeremiah. Jeremiah is this

02:15:49.257 --> 02:16:01.746
mid-40s halfling fellow. Pale, but well-dressed in
colorful silks and vibrant makeup. From some of

02:16:01.746 --> 02:16:06.741
the theater productions you've seen, he seems
almost made up for the stage, but just a cook. Big

02:16:06.741 --> 02:16:13.656
smile, big curled, waxed mustache, hair parted and
curled on the sides, light brown, auburn hair.

02:16:13.656 --> 02:16:21.422
Portly halfling fellow, and as you're shouting his
name, he goes, "Hello? Are you looking for me?"

02:16:21.422 --> 02:16:23.264
MARISHA: Yep, Jeremiah.

02:16:23.264 --> 02:16:25.625
MATT: "I'm Jeremiah. What's your name?"

02:16:25.625 --> 02:16:26.947
MARISHA: Hi. Beau.

02:16:26.947 --> 02:16:33.745
MATT: "Beau, yes. You're one of the new kids. I am
making food. Would you--?"

02:16:33.745 --> 02:16:38.494
MARISHA: What do you have right now? Something
ready? I want to chew on something while we talk.

02:16:38.494 --> 02:16:41.357
MATT: "Fine, here you go." He hands over a
somewhat stale loaf.

02:16:41.357 --> 02:16:43.956
MARISHA: Thank you. You have sausage to go with
that?

02:16:43.956 --> 02:16:48.245
MATT: "No, they are being prepared, and I wish not
to serve something that is unfinished."

02:16:48.245 --> 02:16:50.731
MARISHA: Water. Wine.

02:16:50.731 --> 02:16:58.634
MATT: (sighs) Grabs a thing of wine, a small jar,
and says, "You can fetch your own water."

02:16:58.634 --> 02:17:01.855
MARISHA: Thank you, sorry, I'm just hungry as
fuck. I go back to the group.

02:17:01.855 --> 02:17:08.923
MATT: All right. You guys patiently wait for Beau
to return with a stale--

02:17:08.923 --> 02:17:11.171
MARISHA: I got appetizers. There you go.

02:17:11.171 --> 02:17:14.596
SAM: Okay, that's good. (gnawing)

02:17:14.596 --> 02:17:22.421
TRAVIS: I should start by thanking all of you for
putting yourselves in harm's way again. I did not

02:17:22.818 --> 02:17:27.866
expect that to go the way that it did, but that
seems a repetitive notion at this point.

02:17:27.866 --> 02:17:31.760
MARISHA: What the fuck actually happened down
there? We haven't really gotten a clear

02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:35.140
description, and we're all confused.

02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:42.305
TRAVIS: Yeah. I knew when she showed that
exuberance at diving down that it was a matter of

02:17:42.305 --> 02:17:49.072
urgency, and I just couldn't catch her. We made
our way down this well into this open, spherical

02:17:49.072 --> 02:17:54.705
room. At the bottom underneath some algae, there
was a recession. It looked like it had space for

02:17:54.705 --> 02:18:04.286
an orb, like the eye that's in my sword. In my
dullardly moment of trying to figure how the fuck

02:18:04.286 --> 02:18:11.139
I would get it in there, she reached out, and she
has the same sort of thing in her hand. She put it

02:18:11.139 --> 02:18:20.268
in before I could put the sword in. It ripped the
eye straight out of her hand. Pulled her hand back

02:18:20.268 --> 02:18:27.428
and blood was coming out of it; I thought it had
done something to her. That's when I saw these

02:18:27.428 --> 02:18:33.205
arcane-like symbols light up and they shoot across
the floor and straight up toward you guys right

02:18:33.205 --> 02:18:34.123
above the water.

02:18:34.123 --> 02:18:35.767
MARISHA: Yeah, we saw them.

02:18:35.767 --> 02:18:39.246
TRAVIS: You saw them come out? What happened?

02:18:39.246 --> 02:18:42.779
MARISHA: It connected to the pillars and then
that's when everything started flooding. Then it

02:18:42.779 --> 02:18:46.065
was just running for our lives at that point. I
don't know. I didn't see much else.

02:18:46.065 --> 02:18:53.379
LIAM: It was in a hurry, but the type of runes
that were in that chamber were one of protection,

02:18:53.379 --> 02:19:00.777
some sort of ward that I don't understand. It's
old. It shook the entire room we were in. I

02:19:00.777 --> 02:19:07.110
thought maybe there were three locks down there,
but you only saw one. Presumably, there are two

02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:11.592
more places in the ocean or in the world for you.

02:19:11.592 --> 02:19:14.733
TRAVIS: That seems like a lot.

02:19:14.733 --> 02:19:19.686
TALIESIN: There's more than one. There was more
than one creature.

02:19:19.686 --> 02:19:28.182
MARISHA: There's also the temple where we found
this thing that had the snake, the naga.

02:19:28.182 --> 02:19:35.364
TRAVIS: But no recession. I can't remember, when
we found the actual cat's eye, the sphere, it

02:19:35.364 --> 02:19:38.309
wasn't in a recession. Was it just resting at the
bottom of the well?

02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:41.574
MATT: It was just sitting in a pool of water, and
you found that amongst other piles. It seemed to

02:19:41.574 --> 02:19:50.107
be less of a temple and more of a scavenged
artifact amongst a merrow den that was expanding

02:19:50.107 --> 02:19:51.470
beneath the swamp.

02:19:51.470 --> 02:19:55.577
TALIESIN: We need three onyx eyes, three ivory
eyes, three amber eyes.

02:19:55.577 --> 02:19:57.879
TRAVIS: From three different creatures.

02:19:57.879 --> 02:20:00.671
MARISHA: What was the one that was inside of you?
Is it the onyx one?

02:20:00.671 --> 02:20:02.105
TRAVIS: No, it was the amber one.

02:20:02.105 --> 02:20:04.284
MARISHA: It was the amber one. Oh shit!

02:20:04.284 --> 02:20:07.409
TRAVIS: Yeah. That big serpent with all the eyes
like in her captain's--

02:20:07.409 --> 02:20:09.815
SAM: What was Avantika's?

02:20:09.815 --> 02:20:11.113
TRAVIS: Amber, yeah.

02:20:11.113 --> 02:20:12.841
MARISHA: Is it the same color?

02:20:12.841 --> 02:20:18.211
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, they're yellowish-amber.
Yellowish-orange. Just depends on the way the

02:20:18.211 --> 02:20:19.653
light hits it.

02:20:19.653 --> 02:20:24.915
MARISHA: So in the amber, it was the giant serpent
with the tidal wave.

02:20:24.915 --> 02:20:37.555
TRAVIS: Yeah, the same that she had decorated
around her office. That's Uk'otoa. You saw when we

02:20:37.555 --> 02:20:42.334
were in the boat, she closed her hands and you
felt that surge in the water?

02:20:42.334 --> 02:20:43.559
LIAM: Yeah.

02:20:43.559 --> 02:20:51.170
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think because she got there first
and offered her orb, she was rewarded with some

02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:55.720
sort of oceanic control or power over water.

02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:58.169
SAM: She controlled the water?

02:20:58.169 --> 02:20:59.920
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:02.615
SAM: She's the one who made the flood?

02:21:02.615 --> 02:21:06.860
TRAVIS: No, back when we were in the rowboats.

02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:14.494
SAM: Oh, when we took off. I was curled up in the
bottom of the well of the rowboat, cowering, so I

02:21:14.494 --> 02:21:20.592
didn't see any of that. She got something for
giving up her--?

02:21:20.592 --> 02:21:25.394
TRAVIS: I think so, yeah. I don't know why the
water surged out of the temple like that.

02:21:25.394 --> 02:21:34.365
SAM: We also heard a large cracking sound as if a
lock had been broken or a wall had been broken.

02:21:34.365 --> 02:21:36.290
TRAVIS: You said they were protective in nature?

02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:37.101
LIAM: Yeah.

02:21:37.101 --> 02:21:49.850
MARISHA: So three murals. Three creatures--
beings. Three chosen ones. And three different

02:21:49.850 --> 02:21:51.385
eyes in each.

02:21:51.385 --> 02:21:54.226
TALIESIN: A creature of the sea, a creature of the
air with fire--

02:21:54.226 --> 02:21:56.917
MARISHA and TALIESIN: And a creature of the
earth.

02:21:56.917 --> 02:22:02.784
MARISHA: Do I remember anything from hitting the
books in school of some gods?

02:22:02.784 --> 02:22:04.812
MATT: Roll a history check.

02:22:04.812 --> 02:22:06.675
MARISHA: It would be history and not religion?

02:22:06.675 --> 02:22:10.270
MATT: This would be history, technically.
Actually, history or religion.

02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:22.154
MARISHA: Well, they're the same for me. Same
modifier. 17. Her-story!

02:22:22.154 --> 02:22:34.901
MATT: You recall tales-- I mean, there are many
powerful creatures that have existed throughout

02:22:35.042 --> 02:22:47.049
history, entities that are either elemental in
nature or are primal forces of power. There are

02:22:47.049 --> 02:22:51.158
some that are guardians of the world, some that
are guardians of the elements within their own

02:22:51.158 --> 02:23:01.545
planes. There are many types of horrors and
protectors throughout history. Thinking back to

02:23:01.545 --> 02:23:07.993
some of your studies, both historically and in
cracking the tome of the occasional religious

02:23:07.993 --> 02:23:17.191
thing against your better will in your classes,
there are some entities that were left in the wake

02:23:17.191 --> 02:23:21.718
of the Divergence: avatar-like entities, or at
least creations that were meant to be an extension

02:23:21.718 --> 02:23:32.198
of the power of the gods. Some of them are
guardians in the world, some of them still remain

02:23:32.198 --> 02:23:38.254
true to the religions or the gods that created
them. Some, over time, have found their own

02:23:38.254 --> 02:23:47.788
interests. Some have grown obsessed with their own
power without their creator and master to chastise

02:23:47.788 --> 02:23:56.527
or watch over them, and see themselves as a new
god, even. Thinking back, you don't have all the

02:23:56.527 --> 02:24:06.963
information, but you do know that-- thinking back
to the murals and things you've heard about

02:24:06.963 --> 02:24:14.597
Uk'otoa being said, Uk'otoa was worshipped by the
Ki'Nau, which were the indigenous people of the

02:24:14.597 --> 02:24:22.705
Menagerie Coast and the Swavain Islands in the
vicinity. Uk'otoa was one of these avatar entities

02:24:22.705 --> 02:24:33.804
that was created by Zehir, the Cloaked Serpent, to
be one of its many ambassadors of power and one of

02:24:33.804 --> 02:24:40.265
its greatest warriors in the conflict of the
Calamity.

02:24:40.265 --> 02:24:42.596
MARISHA: Big kaijus-kind of thing?

02:24:42.596 --> 02:24:48.278
MATT: Essentially. When Zehir and the rest of the
betrayer gods were banished along with the other

02:24:48.278 --> 02:24:57.231
prime deities, they were now the most powerful
beings on the surface of Exandria. As such, new

02:24:57.231 --> 02:25:05.562
religions began to spring up around them. The
Ki'Nau of this area took to worshipping Uk'otoa,

02:25:05.562 --> 02:25:16.433
and Uk'otoa began to preside like the next best
god there was. You get the sense that these other

02:25:16.433 --> 02:25:28.266
two entities might be similar relics of this time:
powerful beings created before or during the

02:25:28.266 --> 02:25:36.643
Calamity and then left with their gods now sealed
away to become forces of power of their own. You

02:25:36.643 --> 02:25:41.109
don't know if they've been sealed in the same fate
that Uk'otoa was. But based on what you saw in

02:25:41.109 --> 02:25:50.149
that temple, they seem to be connected or at
least, have similar structure of worship.

02:25:50.149 --> 02:25:53.066
TRAVIS: This is some heavy shit.

02:25:53.066 --> 02:26:01.593
MARISHA: I say all of that. I read this one
paragraph once and then the filigree, there was a

02:26:01.879 --> 02:26:09.754
monk with a trumpet up his ass, and that's why I
remembered this section so well. In fact, still

02:26:09.754 --> 02:26:12.846
remember the book. Bet if we go back to the
library, we could still find it and we could

02:26:12.846 --> 02:26:14.004
figure out more about this.

02:26:14.004 --> 02:26:17.795
MATT: If you were to find a place of deep
research, you could probably find more information

02:26:17.795 --> 02:26:19.577
about these entities, yes.

02:26:19.577 --> 02:26:22.161
TRAVIS: That would be a choice.

02:26:22.161 --> 02:26:27.363
MARISHA: Speaking of choice, what's yours?

02:26:27.363 --> 02:26:33.831
LIAM: Yeah, she said for all of us to hear that
the real reward comes from releasing the serpent.

02:26:33.831 --> 02:26:36.953
Is that your intentions? Is that what you desire?

02:26:36.953 --> 02:26:38.380
TRAVIS: No!

02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:40.273
MARISHA: It feels like she has bigger plans.

02:26:40.273 --> 02:26:46.764
TRAVIS: I'm not a crazy person, all right? A giant
serpent from the Calamity?

02:26:46.764 --> 02:26:49.402
MARISHA: The Divergence, yeah.

02:26:49.402 --> 02:26:55.270
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's some medieval shit. That is
bigger than anything I've ever heard of.

02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:56.758
LIAM: So what are we doing?

02:26:56.758 --> 02:27:01.536
SAM: Are we pirates now? Is that the thing?
Because I don't like the water at all. I don't

02:27:01.536 --> 02:27:03.325
want to be on a boat anymore.

02:27:03.325 --> 02:27:10.600
TRAVIS: I know, and Caduceus, I know your
experiences with water have been less than thrilling.

02:27:10.955 --> 02:27:19.445
MARISHA: I've actually had a good time. I've died
a few times, but I'm great.

02:27:19.445 --> 02:27:28.020
TALIESIN: I think the question really is what
we're going to have to do about this. I mean, this

02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:33.769
is the direction that we're heading. This is
what's being put in front of us. I don't know if

02:27:33.769 --> 02:27:44.220
running headlong into the next temple is the best
option. I think maybe if you didn't find the

02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:48.961
answers you were looking for down in the water,
maybe it's time to look somewhere else.

02:27:48.961 --> 02:27:57.968
SAM: If I might, Fjord. I don't know much about
how this magic works, but if there's three of

02:27:57.968 --> 02:28:08.884
these things, right, at least three of these eyes
that need to be placed to unlock three temples of

02:28:08.884 --> 02:28:17.313
whatever and release the crazy thing under the
ocean. One has been activated, one is inside you,

02:28:17.313 --> 02:28:27.119
there's one-- maybe we should try to find that
one. With that one, we could then safely get the

02:28:27.119 --> 02:28:32.834
one out of you because we would have the third one
and we could go break it somewhere and then we'd

02:28:32.834 --> 02:28:35.365
know that no one could unlock it ever.

02:28:35.365 --> 02:28:41.326
TRAVIS: I'm all for trying to get knowledge out of
the captain. She seemed to act like she knew who

02:28:41.326 --> 02:28:44.893
the third person was, or had been.

02:28:44.893 --> 02:28:56.218
MARISHA: She also seems very interested in you.
And don't get me wrong, she's hot and all, but I

02:28:56.218 --> 02:29:03.700
question her motives. Feels like she's-- I don't
know.

02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:06.967
LIAM: She looks at him like a skeleton key; she
needs him for what she wants.

02:29:06.967 --> 02:29:13.082
MARISHA: I agree with that, and I think she's
understood that her sexuality can be wielded as a weapon.

02:29:13.421 --> 02:29:22.962
TRAVIS: I see that, as well. Thank you for the
lookout. Frankly, between us, I actually tried to

02:29:22.962 --> 02:29:28.971
keep her underwater, after. She got away real
fast.

02:29:28.971 --> 02:29:30.302
MARISHA: Oh, that's fucking brutal.

02:29:30.302 --> 02:29:34.350
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then I had to act like, "No,
look at the ground." It was terrible, fucking failed.

02:29:34.350 --> 02:29:38.235
TALIESIN: All things considered, I think it would
be best if we left on good terms.

02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:42.776
TRAVIS: I agree. I'd like to find out what she
knows about the third, and then maybe ask for a

02:29:42.776 --> 02:29:48.005
bit of respite before we continue. I actually do
not feel very comfortable--

02:29:48.005 --> 02:29:51.475
TALIESIN: Let's get to port and restock, and
that's when we'll figure out--

02:29:51.475 --> 02:29:54.478
LIAM: I doubt she would allow us to leave on any
terms.

02:29:54.478 --> 02:29:55.972
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:29:55.972 --> 02:29:57.929
LIAM: She needs what's in him.

02:29:57.929 --> 02:30:06.023
SAM: What if we surprise her, tie her up, then
Jester can do her Zone of Truth thing. We can find

02:30:06.023 --> 02:30:10.654
out everything she knows, slit her throat, and
sink her ship.

02:30:10.654 --> 02:30:18.650
TRAVIS: See, I would be all for that, given the
circumstances of what Beau just outlined. Big

02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:29.430
consequences looming that are age-old, timeless
things. But if she can control water now, I would

02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:35.630
be concerned that that effort might fall short,
and then we'd be super fucked. I don't know what

02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:37.062
her abilities are.

02:30:37.062 --> 02:30:43.454
TALIESIN: Perhaps some sign of agreement to share
information with the understanding that you're

02:30:43.454 --> 02:30:47.320
both working towards the same goals, and maybe it
would be better to have two groups doing this

02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:48.512
instead of one.

02:30:48.512 --> 02:30:59.024
TRAVIS: Yes. I need more info, Caleb. I need more
data, more knowledge. You read books on this

02:30:59.024 --> 02:31:04.296
stuff. There has to be someone out there that
knows more about this before we just charge in.

02:31:04.296 --> 02:31:07.322
TALIESIN: She's already said that she's sent
people out to do this work. It wouldn't be that

02:31:07.322 --> 02:31:08.876
much different, I suppose.

02:31:08.876 --> 02:31:13.004
TRAVIS: If we have what she needs, she'll have to
play nice.

02:31:13.004 --> 02:31:18.788
SAM: What if we just leave her? She could go off
and do god knows what.

02:31:18.788 --> 02:31:20.243
TALIESIN: As opposed to what?

02:31:20.243 --> 02:31:23.466
SAM: He can stay with her, we can stop it before
she does it.

02:31:23.466 --> 02:31:28.305
TRAVIS: I think she's only interested in the one
creature, so she's only interested in this type of

02:31:28.305 --> 02:31:34.895
eye. I don't even want to start to think about the
onyx eyes or the ivory eyes.

02:31:34.895 --> 02:31:39.854
LIAM: If we want to leave, we are not going to
walk away; we're going to sneak away. She's not

02:31:39.854 --> 02:31:44.227
going to let go of you. You are a key that she
needs. She said herself that greater things come

02:31:44.227 --> 02:31:52.811
when the serpent is released. The giant, god-like
serpent. I would ask you-- we're all here. We like

02:31:52.811 --> 02:32:01.406
you, and if you are being completely forthright
with us, we're good, but if we get the slightest

02:32:01.406 --> 02:32:07.434
whiff that you are after what this woman is
after-- Well, I can't speak for them; I'm not

02:32:07.434 --> 02:32:09.215
interested in being here anymore.

02:32:09.215 --> 02:32:19.400
MATT: Yasha puts her hand on your shoulder and
says, "Faith is a funny thing. Be careful where

02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:33.914
you place it. It can give strength, or it can lead
to terrible things."

02:32:33.914 --> 02:32:48.854
TRAVIS: Thank you, Yasha. I understand your
concern, Caleb, I do. I have a small curiosity

02:32:49.096 --> 02:32:59.948
from the things that I've seen. I have no interest
in dealing with matters that predate time as we

02:32:59.948 --> 02:33:12.059
know it. I'm pretty simple. These days I've spent
with you are the most exciting of my entire life.

02:33:12.059 --> 02:33:18.857
I'm not looking to end them, or the world, by
frivolously giving up something that I barely

02:33:18.857 --> 02:33:28.812
understand. I'd like to try to ask if we can go
separate ways and if she says no, I would play

02:33:28.812 --> 02:33:37.045
that we would join her and her voyages in the
morning and then sneak away. I'd like to try and

02:33:37.045 --> 02:33:38.965
do it amicably, if we can.

02:33:38.965 --> 02:33:46.580
MARISHA: I don't think there's anything wrong with
maybe asking for The Mist. I think maybe Caduceus

02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:52.598
has a good point, if we can convince her that
we're still part of her crew by doing our own recon.

02:33:52.598 --> 02:33:58.960
TALIESIN: To be honest, it would be worth actually
following through with it anyway. She knows things

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:01.263
that we don't. We get to find out.

02:34:01.263 --> 02:34:04.539
MARISHA: We took all that time to learn how to
sail the damn thing.

02:34:04.539 --> 02:34:09.100
LIAM: Also, that boat is fucked and they could
shoot us to bloody hell if they wanted to, so it

02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:13.115
won't be that big of a stretch if we wanted
private sleeping quarters.

02:34:13.115 --> 02:34:19.123
TRAVIS: For sure. I think either way we have to
make it to Darktow. And we need a second ship.

02:34:19.123 --> 02:34:24.306
Third, if she doesn't have a specific location,
two ships find that thing faster than one.

02:34:24.306 --> 02:34:25.570
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:34:25.570 --> 02:34:27.309
TALIESIN: That's true.

02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:32.775
TRAVIS: What do you say? We'll have to play along
until we get to Darktow, and it is not somewhere

02:34:32.775 --> 02:34:36.302
that you normally want to go if you're not of the
pirate variety.

02:34:36.302 --> 02:34:43.358
LIAM: None of us have any chance, any other option
but to play along.

02:34:43.358 --> 02:34:47.795
TALIESIN: Is this some sort of pirate town?

02:34:47.795 --> 02:34:54.350
TRAVIS: I think it's a pirate island. It's a
hideaway. You don't go there unless you're looking

02:34:54.350 --> 02:34:57.688
for trouble, or unless you are the trouble.

02:34:57.688 --> 02:35:07.224
MARISHA: Hee! That's awesome. Speaking of trouble,
are you going to take her up on that glass of wine?

02:35:08.993 --> 02:35:09.961
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:35:09.961 --> 02:35:13.244
MARISHA: That she has mentioned three times.

02:35:13.244 --> 02:35:15.582
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:35:15.582 --> 02:35:17.211
LIAM: What's Jester doing right now?

02:35:17.211 --> 02:35:18.021
MATT: Fuming.

02:35:18.021 --> 02:35:20.679
SAM: She's just touching her lips.

02:35:20.679 --> 02:35:26.369
TALIESIN: Jester's carving something into the bow
of the boat and we don't know what. She's got the

02:35:26.369 --> 02:35:30.031
axe and she's moving it in a direction without
looking.

02:35:30.031 --> 02:35:35.221
TRAVIS: I suppose I should, to keep relations up.

02:35:35.221 --> 02:35:41.383
LIAM: Yeah, well, you do what you have to.

02:35:44.563 --> 02:35:55.097
TRAVIS: Yes. All right, I'll see you all
underneath.

02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:05.639
SAM: Wait. Take this vial of acid, just in case. I
don't know. Maybe she'll try something and you

02:36:05.639 --> 02:36:07.326
just splash it in her face. I don't know.

02:36:07.326 --> 02:36:08.319
TRAVIS: In her face?

02:36:08.319 --> 02:36:09.107
SAM: I don't know!

02:36:09.107 --> 02:36:10.306
TRAVIS: I think it just burns.

02:36:10.306 --> 02:36:12.119
SAM: Sure, whatever.

02:36:12.119 --> 02:36:13.257
TRAVIS: Is it magic acid?

02:36:13.257 --> 02:36:14.429
SAM: Nope, just acid.

02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:16.035
TRAVIS: Okay. Did you make this?

02:36:16.035 --> 02:36:16.738
SAM: I did.

02:36:16.738 --> 02:36:18.163
TRAVIS: Thank you!

02:36:18.163 --> 02:36:21.189
TALIESIN: Are we now going to go and sleep and
properly sleep?

02:36:21.189 --> 02:36:24.434
SAM: No not until he comes back from his
rendezvous.

02:36:24.434 --> 02:36:29.722
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to go to sleep. I
don't know about the rest of you. I'm going to pat

02:36:29.722 --> 02:36:33.380
him on the shoulder and, just for fun, cast
Protection from Poison.

02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:35.041
TRAVIS: Ooh!

02:36:35.041 --> 02:36:36.670
TALIESIN: You've got an hour.

02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:43.414
TRAVIS: Okay. All right. Thank you, Caduceus. I'm
going to make you a fan of water before your life

02:36:43.414 --> 02:36:45.272
is done, I swear.

02:36:45.272 --> 02:36:51.031
TALIESIN: I don't mind it. I think I just have an
issue with the things that are in it and being

02:36:51.031 --> 02:36:55.824
under it and I'm going to go to sleep and probably,
yeah, throw up a little.

02:36:55.824 --> 02:36:57.224
SAM: I don't like it at all.

02:36:57.224 --> 02:37:01.346
TRAVIS: You're going to be my strongest acolyte.
You're going to preach the words of the water.

02:37:01.346 --> 02:37:02.873
SAM: It's terrible.

02:37:02.873 --> 02:37:07.875
TRAVIS: It's really not. I mean, look how good
you're doing, right? Thriving. Surviving.

02:37:07.875 --> 02:37:11.280
SAM: This was the worst day of my life.

02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:15.459
TALIESIN: I can't leave yet.

02:37:15.459 --> 02:37:18.940
TRAVIS: Your whole life?

02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:29.978
SAM: I mean, as far as I can remember. This was a
really bad day, and water had a lot to do with it.

02:37:30.227 --> 02:37:36.519
(laughter)

02:37:36.519 --> 02:37:40.812
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. I'll get back to you on that.

02:37:40.812 --> 02:37:42.328
SAM: Sure.

02:37:42.328 --> 02:37:45.287
TRAVIS: I'll make my way towards the captain's
quarters.

02:37:45.287 --> 02:37:48.043
TALIESIN: We're going to figure out a way for you
to breath underwater. It's going to be okay.

02:37:48.043 --> 02:37:51.610
SAM: Oh, I don't care about being underwater. I
just don't like looking at it.

02:37:51.610 --> 02:37:54.588
TALIESIN: Come on.

02:37:54.588 --> 02:37:57.717
MATT: So you guys all go to rest?

02:37:57.717 --> 02:37:59.804
LIAM: Yeah, I'm exhausted.

02:37:59.804 --> 02:38:01.491
MATT: All right. You guys go to rest.

02:38:01.491 --> 02:38:03.170
TALIESIN: A long rest.

02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:05.937
MATT: You head your way to the captain's
quarters?

02:38:05.937 --> 02:38:07.113
TRAVIS: I do.

02:38:07.113 --> 02:38:13.330
MATT: All right. You head to the door. It's
closed. (knocking) For a moment, you hear this

02:38:13.330 --> 02:38:16.685
sound of rushing water.

02:38:16.685 --> 02:38:18.139
LIAM: She's cleaning up.

02:38:18.139 --> 02:38:19.728
TRAVIS: I'll try the door.

02:38:19.728 --> 02:38:27.884
MATT: Okay, it opens up. It's the normal office
den set up, but there's the balcony out back that

02:38:27.884 --> 02:38:33.147
opens up, and there on the balcony, Avantika is
standing on the balcony and there's this column of

02:38:33.147 --> 02:38:43.884
water that is rising up out of the ocean. She's
nude. It's washing her. She's in the process, in

02:38:43.884 --> 02:38:51.335
the throes of manipulating this water. She's
learning whatever this new gifted power that she

02:38:51.335 --> 02:39:00.510
has. Her hair is twirling up into the stream and
it's this beautiful almost-dance between her and

02:39:00.510 --> 02:39:07.556
this elemental force that she now has. She looks
back over her shoulder at you, knowing that you've

02:39:07.556 --> 02:39:12.403
been there for at least a couple minutes. "I'll be
just a moment."

02:39:12.403 --> 02:39:15.180
TRAVIS: Don't rush on my account.

02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:24.882
MATT: Eventually the water splashes down and off
the side. She walks back out of the night air and

02:39:25.125 --> 02:39:27.658
pulls her hair up and ties it off.

02:39:27.658 --> 02:39:29.473
LIAM: I've seen this film.

02:39:29.473 --> 02:39:34.208
MATT: She takes a little silk robe and places it
over her and sits down. There are already two

02:39:34.208 --> 02:39:41.255
glasses places on the table. She uncorks it and
pours two glasses.

02:39:41.255 --> 02:39:43.037
TRAVIS: To your success.

02:39:43.037 --> 02:39:46.838
MATT: "To our success in time, eh?"

02:39:46.838 --> 02:39:53.704
TRAVIS: One can hope. It's only fair; you've been
on this journey far longer than I have.

02:39:53.704 --> 02:40:05.880
MATT: "This is true." Not the best wine you've
had, but it's serviceable.

02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:07.506
TRAVIS: Not aerated.

02:40:07.506 --> 02:40:19.099
MATT: "I am excited for you to experience this."

02:40:19.099 --> 02:40:23.571
TRAVIS: I am as well. Is it everything you thought
it would be?

02:40:23.571 --> 02:40:31.356
MATT: "I've only but scratched the surface, and
I've never felt a connection like this with the

02:40:31.356 --> 02:40:41.631
"sea that has been my life. It's incredible. I can
only do it in bursts, but I can cause it to swell

02:40:41.631 --> 02:40:49.933
"and move and part and flood and shift. It's--
(sighs). Soon." She reaches out and touches the

02:40:49.933 --> 02:41:00.406
top of your hand. "Soon. I promise. Now, we were
talking before and I think it's only fair." She

02:41:00.406 --> 02:41:12.795
takes another big sip. "Your blade is very
interesting. I knew one other who had a blade very

02:41:12.795 --> 02:41:19.385
"similar. Referred to it as the Sword of Fathoms."

02:41:21.585 --> 02:41:23.963
TRAVIS: Sword of Fathoms?

02:41:25.773 --> 02:41:28.327
MATT: "The previous chosen."

02:41:31.587 --> 02:41:35.311
TRAVIS: Can you tell me more about this person who
wielded it?

02:41:36.901 --> 02:41:39.479
MATT: "His name was Vandren."

02:41:41.589 --> 02:41:44.083
MARISHA: (whispering) Fuck!

02:41:44.083 --> 02:41:54.512
MATT: "A fine sailor and a foolish coward he ended
up to be, but he was the one that... opened my eyes

02:41:54.518 --> 02:42:05.380
"to the destiny of Uk'otoa. We traveled together
for a number of years before he just abandoned and

02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:15.257
"absconded with something important. I've been
trying to find out where he went, but he is very

02:42:15.257 --> 02:42:28.370
"slippery. Wherever he is, either what you have in
your sword is what he took away or wherever he is

02:42:28.370 --> 02:42:30.669
"he has the third with him."

02:42:33.899 --> 02:42:44.147
TRAVIS: This Vandren, you say he told you about
the Sword of Fathoms or he had a Sword of Fathoms?

02:42:44.853 --> 02:42:46.538
MATT: "He carried the same blade."

02:42:46.538 --> 02:42:56.356
TRAVIS: The same one. Was there an area, a
destination, a direction that you last knew that

02:42:56.356 --> 02:43:01.079
he was going? Is it in our interest to try and
find him?

02:43:01.079 --> 02:43:14.479
MATT: "It is very much in our interests. We were
going to go and visit this very island some time

02:43:14.479 --> 02:43:21.853
"ago when he was the only one to have one of these
orbs."

02:43:23.963 --> 02:43:30.332
TRAVIS: How did you find, if you don't mind me
asking, yours?

02:43:32.068 --> 02:43:47.523
MATT: "Well-- I had to kill a number of men. It
was being auctioned off in Port Damali, and there

02:43:47.523 --> 02:44:00.719
"was a collector. Word had gotten to us that this
artifact was sold off to this individual. Well,

02:44:00.719 --> 02:44:04.466
"needless to say, he put up a bit of a struggle."

02:44:04.466 --> 02:44:07.154
TRAVIS: I'm sure he did.

02:44:07.154 --> 02:44:14.103
MATT: "Thankfully this collector enjoyed nights
long at sea and that happens to be our specialty.

02:44:14.103 --> 02:44:23.551
"His corpse now adorns one of the many beautiful
islands and now I have this beautiful reminder."

02:44:23.551 --> 02:44:30.033
The hand, you can see, it's now mostly healed
over, but there is a scar where this orb once

02:44:30.033 --> 02:44:31.914
resided in her palm.

02:44:31.914 --> 02:44:39.182
TRAVIS: I'll stand and just pace around the
quarters, looking at the various iconography of

02:44:39.182 --> 02:44:40.287
the serpent.

02:44:40.287 --> 02:44:47.086
MATT: As you're pacing, she talks towards you.
"It's very interesting that you carry the same

02:44:47.086 --> 02:45:01.901
"blade as Vandren did and come to me with what
could very well be the same orb. Do you know this

02:45:01.901 --> 02:45:03.860
"one? This Vandren?"

02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:09.923
TRAVIS: I don't. We should find him.

02:45:09.923 --> 02:45:11.811
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:45:13.871 --> 02:45:19.965
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter) 23.

02:45:19.965 --> 02:45:22.958
SAM: Contested!

02:45:22.958 --> 02:45:29.188
(no audio)

02:45:29.188 --> 02:45:30.577
MATT: "Hmm."

02:45:33.707 --> 02:45:47.713
TRAVIS: (long sigh) This sword came to me in a very unusual
way. I've been a sailor for many years myself and

02:45:47.876 --> 02:45:54.297
was lost at sea during a storm. When I woke up, I
found myself on the shore, and there in the waves

02:45:54.297 --> 02:46:03.592
next to me was this sword. I don't know how I got
there, but as soon as I grasped it, it changed

02:46:03.592 --> 02:46:13.415
everything. The sword, however, did not have the
eye. The eye we found later, my companions and me.

02:46:13.415 --> 02:46:18.273
MATT: "Who else was on this ship with you?"

02:46:18.273 --> 02:46:26.515
TRAVIS: Various other sailors. Our captain.

02:46:26.515 --> 02:46:29.155
MATT: "Who was your captain?"

02:46:29.155 --> 02:46:33.139
TRAVIS: Captain Twitchwood. Do you know him?

02:46:33.139 --> 02:46:48.820
MATT: She smiles. "I appreciate that you are a
very accomplished liar. But so am I. The only

02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:57.426
"reason why I still sit here before you with the
dozen or so scars I carry is because I have been

02:46:57.426 --> 02:47:01.219
"very keen at seeing through the same skill."

02:47:01.219 --> 02:47:07.350
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) A 23 level skill? Okay.

02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:14.428
LIAM: His name is Captain Wiggledick.

02:47:14.428 --> 02:47:22.601
TRAVIS: Then I'm sure you can understand the need
for secrecy for a small circle.

02:47:22.601 --> 02:47:27.424
MATT: "You know Vandren, don't you?"

02:47:27.424 --> 02:47:30.396
TRAVIS: I do.

02:47:30.396 --> 02:47:37.357
MATT: "And he was on this ship that you
shipwrecked on, eh? Do you remember where this

02:47:37.357 --> 02:47:39.552
"storm was?"

02:47:39.552 --> 02:47:42.801
TRAVIS: I remember where we found the stone.

02:47:42.801 --> 02:47:45.914
MATT: "Do you remember where the storm was?"

02:47:45.914 --> 02:47:47.429
TRAVIS: The storm.

02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:49.652
MATT: "That sunk the ship you were on?"

02:47:49.652 --> 02:47:51.527
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:47:51.527 --> 02:47:56.710
MATT: "This was the last time you saw Vandren?"

02:47:56.710 --> 02:48:05.630
TRAVIS: I feel like you know the rest of this
story, and I am at a disadvantage.

02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:11.621
MATT: "I don't necessarily-- I have not seen
Vandren since he absconded with this-- many

02:48:11.621 --> 02:48:23.250
"things. But he will not travel with both that
sword you carry and the orb he stole from us. So

02:48:23.250 --> 02:48:32.684
"wherever that ship has sunken, there's a very good
chance that it has the third missing orb. Do you

02:48:32.684 --> 02:48:35.772
"remember where the ship sunk?"

02:48:35.772 --> 02:48:40.189
TRAVIS: (sighing)

02:48:40.189 --> 02:48:45.119
MATT: She reaches out and pulls out a map and
rolls it out on the table in before you. Put your

02:48:45.119 --> 02:48:46.009
map up.

02:48:46.009 --> 02:48:47.803
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah--

02:48:47.803 --> 02:48:49.109
SAM: Just splash acid all over it!

02:48:49.109 --> 02:48:53.292
(laughter)

02:48:53.292 --> 02:48:55.108
SAM: You've got this!

02:48:55.108 --> 02:49:01.618
(background music, rustling)

02:49:01.618 --> 02:49:07.222
TRAVIS: Now, between you and I--

02:49:07.222 --> 02:49:08.086
MATT: Yes.

02:49:08.086 --> 02:49:11.661
TRAVIS: There was a storm-- do I remember?

02:49:11.661 --> 02:49:18.332
MATT: You do recall, actually. It was somewhere
coming back along this trade route and somewhere

02:49:18.451 --> 02:49:21.759
in this space the storm had blown through. This is
where it sank and you washed up--

02:49:21.759 --> 02:49:23.051
TRAVIS: Darktow's over here, right?

02:49:23.051 --> 02:49:25.688
MATT: Darktow's over here. You washed up on this
island, here.

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:27.851
TRAVIS: We're over here.

02:49:27.851 --> 02:49:34.910
MATT: You guys are over there at Urukaxl. You
washed up over here, so the storm was in this vicinity.

02:49:35.182 --> 02:49:48.417
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. Yep. Fuck it.
Yes, I do remember where the ship sank.

02:49:48.417 --> 02:49:56.394
MATT: "Then, my friend, I think we are going to do
even more amazing things together."

02:49:56.394 --> 02:50:07.559
TRAVIS: I agree. I believe that will have to wait
until we find ourselves on Darktow, though.

02:50:07.559 --> 02:50:16.708
MATT: "I have been patient this long. I can be
patient a bit further. Very well." She leans

02:50:16.708 --> 02:50:24.773
forward with the wine glass, very close, and goes,
"It's been a very long day. I think rest is in order?"

02:50:24.773 --> 02:50:31.615
TRAVIS: (laughter) I would agree.

02:50:31.615 --> 02:50:48.140
MATT: She takes a big, long drink of wine, sets it
down. "Well, there are ways to complete a hopeful

02:50:48.140 --> 02:50:53.414
"future pact together. Many different ways."

02:50:53.414 --> 02:50:55.322
(laughter)

02:50:55.322 --> 02:50:57.074
SAM: (whispering) Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:51:00.966 --> 02:51:03.747
LIAM: Fade to tentacles.

02:51:03.747 --> 02:51:18.106
TRAVIS: (stuttering) Yeah, I'm going to go for it.
I'm going for it. I will-- (noises of distress).

02:51:18.106 --> 02:51:31.488
Oh god, okay. Yep, yep, yep. I will keep
Avantika's hand and walk around the desk, and I

02:51:31.488 --> 02:51:36.437
will try the old lean-in and see what the reaction
is.

02:51:36.437 --> 02:51:39.525
MATT: Man, all right.

02:51:39.525 --> 02:51:43.256
SAM: Oh man, I'm getting some Twitchwood right
now.

02:51:43.256 --> 02:51:51.087
(laughter)

02:51:51.087 --> 02:51:57.870
MATT: Quickly, her hand grabs the back of your
head and pulls you in.

02:51:57.870 --> 02:52:03.281
TALIESIN: I'm very mixed about this whole thing.

02:52:03.281 --> 02:52:04.606
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:52:06.276 --> 02:52:14.137
MATT: She's a very powerful woman, and you find
yourself very quickly overpowered. You are allowed to--

02:52:14.885 --> 02:52:21.479
(laughter)

02:52:21.479 --> 02:52:32.469
MATT: For the sake of brevity... Not the most
restful evening you've had, but an evening is had.

02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:34.968
LIAM: How many points of exhaustion?

02:52:34.968 --> 02:52:39.681
MARISHA: Make a constitution check.

02:52:39.681 --> 02:52:45.887
MATT: No, I'm never going to do that in a game.
Sure, go for it, then. That's your own--

02:52:45.887 --> 02:52:47.291
TRAVIS: 16.

02:52:47.291 --> 02:52:49.125
MARISHA: Eyy!

02:52:49.125 --> 02:52:52.100
MATT: (in despair) No... No...

02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:56.546
LIAM: You succeed the check, but you disappoint
your dungeon master.

02:52:56.546 --> 02:53:04.370
MATT: I wouldn't call it a romantic evening, but a
very--

02:53:04.370 --> 02:53:07.197
TRAVIS: An adrenaline--

02:53:07.197 --> 02:53:11.568
MATT: Union of two business partners of a similar
goal.

02:53:11.568 --> 02:53:15.062
SAM: The sound of fish slapping against each
other.

02:53:15.062 --> 02:53:17.373
(laughter)

02:53:17.373 --> 02:53:20.162
SAM: They're both of the sea.

02:53:20.162 --> 02:53:22.725
LIAM: Right in the blowhole.

02:53:22.725 --> 02:53:25.228
MATT: And we fade to black.

02:53:27.338 --> 02:53:38.933
TRAVIS: Do I make my way back to quarters before
sun-up? I don't know if I want to stay the entire

02:53:39.145 --> 02:53:40.501
evening there.

02:53:40.501 --> 02:53:42.190
MATT: You do fall asleep together.

02:53:42.190 --> 02:53:43.609
TRAVIS: Oh! Okay.

02:53:43.609 --> 02:53:46.380
MATT: Unless you choose to not wish to.

02:53:46.380 --> 02:53:56.434
TRAVIS: No, I'm not going to stay. You don't walk
out of the captain's quarters at sun-up. Plus, I'm

02:53:56.434 --> 02:54:03.990
super tired. I will leave and try to stealth back
to the quarters of everyone else.

02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:06.346
TALIESIN: I have a passive perception of 18.

02:54:06.346 --> 02:54:07.727
MATT: I know.

02:54:07.727 --> 02:54:09.396
TRAVIS: Hopefully you're super asleep.

02:54:09.396 --> 02:54:12.426
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

02:54:12.426 --> 02:54:17.187
TRAVIS: Come on, copper dice gods. 18.

02:54:17.187 --> 02:54:26.481
MATT: All right. You carefully and quietly tiptoe
your way through the hallway to your assigned

02:54:26.481 --> 02:54:28.773
quarters, of which you are sharing with whom?

02:54:28.773 --> 02:54:32.332
TRAVIS and MATT: Caduceus.

02:54:32.332 --> 02:54:42.518
MATT: One eye slowly opens as you are keen to be
somewhat aware-- living alone, out in the

02:54:42.518 --> 02:54:48.808
dangerous wood-- to any sort of aberrant noise in
the vicinity. You hear the faint creak of very

02:54:48.808 --> 02:54:52.447
gentle footsteps as Fjord makes his way into your
chambers.

02:54:55.127 --> 02:54:58.929
TALIESIN: Can I figure out what happened just by
looking at him?

02:54:59.244 --> 02:55:00.117
MATT: You? Yeah.

02:55:00.117 --> 02:55:14.656
(giggling)

02:55:14.676 --> 02:55:17.732
TALIESIN: Sleep well with your bad decisions.

02:55:18.275 --> 02:55:28.351
MATT: As you all rest, a long rest at sea, as the
Squalleater and The Mistake make their way towards

02:55:28.351 --> 02:55:33.884
Darktow to the far west, we'll end tonight's game
there and pick up there next week.

02:55:33.884 --> 02:55:35.990
MARISHA: Aw, no, what?!

02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:38.016
MATT: Also, everyone levels up. Everyone's level
seven now.

02:55:38.016 --> 02:55:41.092
(exclamations)

02:55:41.092 --> 02:55:42.289
MARISHA: Cheers!

02:55:42.289 --> 02:55:44.788
LIAM: Aw, that's a great ending. That's a good
finish.

02:55:44.788 --> 02:55:51.079
MATT: To that degree, while I have you guys here,
let's roll some hit points for those who are present.

02:55:51.537 --> 02:55:53.133
SAM: Do we recover our exhaustion?

02:55:53.133 --> 02:55:59.507
MATT: Over the next couple of days you will
because this is a multi-day travel to get to

02:55:59.507 --> 02:56:02.921
Darktow, so your points of exhaustion will be gone
by the time it matters.

02:56:02.921 --> 02:56:04.672
TRAVIS: I'll let Yasha roll for hers.

02:56:04.672 --> 02:56:08.628
SAM: I should probably roll for Laura. What do you
think? You think she'll appreciate that?

02:56:08.628 --> 02:56:10.628
MATT: It's your head, man.

02:56:10.628 --> 02:56:15.473
TRAVIS: d8 for me, right? Five.

02:56:15.473 --> 02:56:17.557
MARISHA: d8 for me as well.

02:56:17.557 --> 02:56:18.890
LIAM: Pitiful.

02:56:18.890 --> 02:56:24.171
MARISHA: It's a d8 plus your constitution, yeah?
Wow, that's a one. Do we still reroll ones?

02:56:24.171 --> 02:56:25.895
MATT: We reroll ones for hit points.

02:56:25.895 --> 02:56:27.477
MARISHA: That's a two!

02:56:27.477 --> 02:56:28.512
SAM: Nice!

02:56:28.512 --> 02:56:30.110
MATT: It's better.

02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:31.078
MARISHA: Thanks.

02:56:31.078 --> 02:56:33.507
SAM: One. Eight!

02:56:33.507 --> 02:56:35.274
MATT: There you go, Nott.

02:56:35.274 --> 02:56:36.911
SAM: So I reroll a one?

02:56:36.911 --> 02:56:42.176
MATT: I reroll ones for hit points, because
rolling a one for hit points at a level up is the

02:56:42.176 --> 02:56:43.920
fucking worst.

02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:45.826
TALIESIN: Rolling a d8, right?

02:56:45.826 --> 02:56:47.274
MATT: What'd you get, Caleb?

02:56:47.274 --> 02:56:50.374
LIAM: I rolled a two, so a con bonus gets me to
four points up.

02:56:50.374 --> 02:56:51.607
MATT: Four more hit points.

02:56:51.607 --> 02:56:52.798
TALIESIN: Six.

02:56:52.798 --> 02:56:57.858
MATT: Six points to you. To be fair, you guys have
been rolling fucking great for hit points for many

02:56:57.858 --> 02:57:00.124
levels. It's time for there to be some balance.

02:57:00.124 --> 02:57:02.246
SAM: I feel like I should reroll this again.

02:57:02.246 --> 02:57:04.131
MATT: No! Take a good one, dude!

02:57:04.131 --> 02:57:05.664
SAM: (sighing)

02:57:05.664 --> 02:57:08.016
TALIESIN: Stop fighting a success!

02:57:08.016 --> 02:57:10.679
MARISHA: I rolled a two--

02:57:10.679 --> 02:57:17.378
MATT: (growling) I rolled good at hit points. This
is bullshit! You're so weird, Sam!

02:57:17.378 --> 02:57:18.684
SAM: It just feels cheap.

02:57:18.684 --> 02:57:20.080
MATT: How does it feel cheap?!

02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:21.664
SAM: Because I rolled a one first!

02:57:21.664 --> 02:57:27.508
MATT: But I reroll ones because--! I already said
it. As a player, it's the worst feeling. Two sucks

02:57:27.508 --> 02:57:31.496
still, but it doesn't suck as much as a one.
That's how I do it.

02:57:31.496 --> 02:57:33.866
TALIESIN: What do I get at level seven?

02:57:33.866 --> 02:57:40.077
MATT: All right, guys. We're not going to sit here
and subject you guys to us leveling up at the

02:57:40.077 --> 02:57:44.801
table-- although I'm sure there are a few that
would love to see it. We got the important part

02:57:44.801 --> 02:57:50.501
out for you guys. We'll pick up here next week to
see what's in store for the company of the

02:57:50.501 --> 02:57:59.221
Squalleater, of which the Mighty Nein have joined.
The union of partnership of Captain Avantika and

02:57:59.221 --> 02:58:06.376
Fjord and the imminent Darktow in your future.

02:58:06.376 --> 02:58:08.423
LIAM: Seamen, seamen, everywhere.

02:58:08.423 --> 02:58:11.253
SAM and TALIESIN: And not a drop to drink.

02:58:11.273 --> 02:58:18.233
(background chatter)

02:58:18.248 --> 02:58:25.690
MATT: (despairing) You may have broken me. I think it finally
happened. I think you finally broke me. I'm broken

02:58:25.690 --> 02:58:35.186
now. I'm a broken man. On that note, have a
wonderful night. We love you guys, and is it

02:58:35.186 --> 02:58:36.726
Thursday yet? Good night.

02:58:36.726 --> 02:58:39.494
(cheering)

02:58:39.494 --> 02:58:47.314
(no audio)

02:58:47.324 --> 03:10:46.275
[music]
